[00:46.48]Did I get the title updated in time?
[00:48.02]Or was I too late?
[00:51.72]Anyways, hi.
[00:52.12]How you guys doing?
[00:55.50]It's been about a week since I last heard your voices.
[01:01.06]I had quite a few setbacks.
[01:06.21]One of them was electricity.
[01:07.89]Lost it again.
[01:10.10]Weird.
[01:10.80]This one thing about living in New England.
[01:13.94]New England's great.
[01:15.42]Boston's great.
[01:17.56]New Hampshire.
[01:18.69]Vermont.
[01:19.43]Great places.
[01:20.35]Connecticut.
[01:20.89]Rhode Island.
[01:22.71]But, man, sometimes we get this weather that makes me want to go live in Arizona.
[01:27.41]Right?
[01:27.65]Like, I might just go live in Arizona.
[01:29.69]That might be the next place.
[01:36.11]I'm just going to drop a pin somewhere in Arizona.
[01:39.61]I'm going to flip a coin and have it go like spin around and land on Arizona and lift it up in whatever the town is I'm going there.
[01:51.58]You forgot Maine.
[01:52.38]I forgot Maine.
[01:53.00]You're right.
[01:57.39]Wait, this is comedy?
[01:58.31]This is not comedy!
[01:59.33]I'm telling you what my fucking plan is, you know what I mean?
[02:03.65]This is not a comedy portion of the stream.
[02:05.53]This is, hey, Jeremy's gonna tell you his plan for the remainder of his life.
[02:12.82]Here comes more comedy.
[02:15.08]No, you'll get plenty of that in about ten minutes.
[02:20.00]Wow, forget my state.
[02:21.26]Wait, New England is... Maine is cool.
[02:24.14]Maine's essentially Canada.
[02:27.58]Maine is like, it's like a potato chip Canada.
[02:33.85]It's alright, I like it.
[02:35.55]My grandmother's from Maine.
[02:37.41]She grew up there.
[02:38.63]It's a pretty great state.
[02:44.61]Anyhow, give me a minute to get started here.
[02:48.90]I could give you a laundry list of things as to why we, you know, I'm not going to do that.
[02:55.43]Take that back.
[02:57.21]No.
[03:01.11]Anywho.
[03:01.69]Yeah.
[03:02.25]Give me a minute.
[03:03.47]Monster Rancher 2 tonight.
[03:05.39]I got some new discs.
[03:06.33]We have some funny comedy discs to put in here tonight.
[03:10.51]Just pray that the computer doesn't blue screen.
[03:13.25]Because I have bad memory sticks.
[03:15.02]And I've done what I need to do.
[03:17.60]I'm just hoping it's not a deeper issue than just the fact that one of my sticks was dead.
[03:24.61]You never know.
[03:26.65]I'm still seeing odd little weird problems.
[03:30.09]And I just hope the motherboard's not bad.
[03:32.05]But the motherboard's not gone.
[03:33.73]Because that is a whole new... I have to like take the whole computer apart.
[03:38.32]And redo a computer if it's the motherboard.
[03:40.48]I really hope it's not.
[03:42.24]So cross your fingers that we don't have any issues tonight.
[03:44.76]Sorry if we do, but I... I would have dealt with this three or four days ago.
[03:54.06]Need that shit Ben Franklin invented to be able to do anything.
[03:59.88]Take it easy, I'll see you.
[04:00.94]No, not take it easy.
[04:01.66]I'll see you in about two minutes.
[04:49.89]Okay.
[04:56.21]So the last time we played Monster Rancher, we left off, we said we're going to play Monster Rancher 2, because that's, you know, the Monster Rancher was interesting, but this one's kind of like Monster Rancher 2.0, because it is a 2 in it.
[05:08.52]It is 2.0, because it's Monster Rancher 2.
[05:13.84]Why is everybody saying shh?
[05:21.76]Be quiet.
[05:22.20]What do you mean be quiet?
[05:25.12]Why are we being quiet?
[05:30.16]It's just a drink.
[05:30.88]Don't calm down.
[05:31.56]Alright, can you guys hear this?
[05:36.65]Yeah, and you can see this too.
[05:38.07]But hold on.
[05:40.31]I just like got out of the shower and I threw my hair back.
[05:44.25]I don't want to do any facecam shit but we have to so I can prove to you what disk I'm putting in.
[05:48.23]Let me just make sure I don't look like fucking trash right now.
[05:51.68]You know what I mean?
[05:53.34]Let me just see what we got here.
[05:54.30]Yeah, I think we're okay.
[06:04.23]We're alright.
[06:04.57]I mean, let's just get out of this shit.
[06:05.53]We're fine.
[06:09.37]Naked.
[06:10.59]Well, that would be odd.
[06:11.27]Put this fucking down.
[06:14.01]Get out of here.
[06:14.79]Don't look at... Stop looking at me!
[06:16.75]I've had a rough week.
[06:18.81]You know, maybe I got like a...
[06:21.43]I still haven't gotten a haircut.
[06:22.37]You know what?
[06:22.67]Hey, like, remember, I'm going to rehash the same joke I made a week ago.
[06:28.01]Jeremy, you need a haircut.
[06:29.07]Go get a haircut.
[06:30.09]And then all electricity in like every town in Massachusetts turned off.
[06:35.22]So I couldn't go to any businesses.
[06:37.02]Fast forward.
[06:37.92]Fast forward fucking like a week.
[06:40.20]Oh, I'm going to go get my haircut.
[06:41.28]No, sorry.
[06:42.96]No, you can't do it again because no business has electricity.
[06:46.74]I can't get my hair cut.
[06:47.76]I'm locked.
[06:48.64]I've been trapped in my house for like two weeks.
[06:52.98]And somebody drove into my car.
[06:54.26]I don't know.
[06:54.94]I'm not even going to get into it.
[06:58.24]You know what I'm saying.
[06:59.00]A plow crashed into my fucking car.
[07:02.36]I don't even need to say it.
[07:06.11]And look.
[07:06.77]Look at this Dunkin' Donuts order.
[07:08.73]Fucking CBBB.
[07:11.07]Can you decipher that code?
[07:15.09]Now I'm just getting worked up because I'm like, I'm rethinking about all these fucking problems.
[07:20.11]And it's just, it's working me up.
[07:21.81]I gotta stop thinking about it.
[07:22.57]Let's just play Monster Rancher.
[07:23.57]Alright, that's not that loud, right?
[07:32.16]Can anyone decipher that code though?
[07:34.04]What is CBBB?
[07:38.15]Hmm?
[07:39.81]New game.
[07:42.50]This is, this is, what?
[07:43.22]The facecam doesn't even need to be on.
[07:44.46]I don't even, I'm, I'm, no.
[07:46.27]Facecam doesn't need to be on until we're putting a CD in.
[07:53.61]Cool boy but bald.
[07:54.81]No, no, you're wrong, sorry.
[08:00.52]Well, the music is already way better than the first one.
[08:06.50]What is this a song of?
[08:11.78]Please.
[08:12.48]Sign your name here.
[08:14.71]Alright, here we go.
[08:17.25]Who should I be this time?
[08:18.47]Just be Jeremy.
[08:22.79]I don't got time for comedy tonight, you know what I mean?
[08:27.05]What about, like, who's like an anti-comedian?
[08:31.53]Who's somebody that's really not funny?
[08:35.57]You know?
[08:36.97]Who's like a thriller director or something?
[08:44.04]me and you carrot top carrot top is a comedian you guys are naming bad comedians I didn't ask for bad comedians I said who's not a comedian who's not funny I don't know but Martin mark twain was really funny wasn't he he had a bunch of funny quotes right
[09:14.57]Yeah, you guys can't just name comedians that you don't think are funny.
[09:20.19]I was gonna say Marty.
[09:21.77]I don't want to be Marty.
[09:24.02]That's too close to Morty.
[09:25.26]And you know how everyone feels about that shit.
[09:31.96]Garfield, no.
[09:33.35]Get that out of here.
[09:41.30]McFly.
[09:42.24]Oh my fucking god.
[09:43.52]I'm gonna go with... I'm just gonna go with Wally, okay?
[09:50.89]Not in all caps.
[09:51.81]Does that make you look like a psycho?
[09:54.09]No, this is not... This is me!
[09:55.53]It's me.
[09:55.93]Just Jeremy.
[09:59.43]This is me.
[10:01.07]I'm not... We can name the monster something fucking stupid, but I'm gonna be me.
[10:05.92]That's all I know how to be, is me.
[10:09.12]Jeremy.
[10:12.51]How do I pick the gender here?
[10:17.33]Is that my middle and last name?
[10:19.33]Am I Jeremy, in quotes, male, and then last name female?
[10:26.06]How do I change that?
[10:26.80]Like, enter?
[10:32.52]Oh, bullshit.
[10:33.26]Enter.
[10:33.60]There we go.
[10:34.46]Okay.
[10:34.78]Are you sure you want to register with this name?
[10:39.61]Wallamy.
[10:40.19]No.
[10:40.49]We're just Jeremy.
[10:48.56]Jeremy, male.
[10:50.50]Yeah, we can name the monster.
[10:51.72]I want to be Jeremy.
[10:52.50]I don't want to be the fucking meme version of my own name.
[10:58.52]We're going to have you take the trainer type test.
[11:06.65]I can mostly forget about an unpleasant experience by the next morning.
[11:11.52]Let's talk about real life here.
[11:14.04]That's true, but what happens when there's like 12 unpleasant things?
[11:19.25]Yeah, I can... The answer is no.
[11:24.45]Yeah, alright, you know, you got me.
[11:25.83]I can't.
[11:28.94]In this world, there is something that I must do at the risk of my own life.
[11:36.12]What do you mean, in this world?
[11:39.75]That's getting a little too existential, a little too deep for me here.
[11:42.15]I'm gonna say no.
[11:46.35]When I am absorbed in something, I don't notice what's going on around me.
[11:50.81]Absolutely.
[11:51.43]I thought that's just when I pee.
[11:56.62]When I see people who are in need, I can't ignore them.
[11:59.90]I can't.
[12:00.32]It's true.
[12:03.08]In order to truly succeed, sometimes I need to make a risky choice.
[12:07.16]I mean, talking about life savings into Ethereum.
[12:10.55]I mean, sometimes you have to do that.
[12:13.80]Turn it out, I mean, you know, turn it out, you know.
[12:16.67]Sometimes it's important for people to simply let something go.
[12:19.97]Yes.
[12:24.17]If I have to choose, I like spring better than winter.
[12:27.66]Yeah!
[12:28.99]Yeah, I do.
[12:30.97]You know, maybe 10 years ago, I would have answered that differently.
[12:33.66]But I'm a goddamn adult now with adult responsibilities.
[12:36.04]And when there's snow on the ground, it makes those responsibilities hard to do.
[12:39.38]So sure, when I was like 20, when I was like 18 or something, oh yeah, I love the snowman.
[12:45.12]Oh, it's a blanket of beautiful blue crystals.
[12:49.07]No, get the fuck out of here.
[12:50.31]I got taxes to do now.
[12:51.77]It's spring.
[12:55.55]I'm the type of person who saves his favorite food until last.
[13:05.66]What does that mean?
[13:14.18]Why is my snow blue?
[13:17.00]Because the moon!
[13:17.70]The moon reflects off the snow.
[13:19.00]It's blue!
[13:19.70]Just look.
[13:20.56]Next time you're outside and there's a bunch of snow on the ground and it's nighttime.
[13:23.89]Take a look.
[13:24.49]It's all blue.
[13:25.39]It's a big hue of blue.
[13:29.69]I don't save my favorite food, no.
[13:34.96]Yes, it is.
[13:36.26]Just look at it.
[13:37.54]The moon is blue.
[13:38.58]The moon is... Have you seen the moonlight?
[13:40.82]Moonlight is not like a lamp in your living room.
[13:44.19]It's bright blue like the ocean.
[13:50.45]My dream can be realized as long as I do my best to achieve it.
[13:53.75]Yes.
[13:54.75]All of you take that fucking advice.
[13:56.66]I have a valuable friend whom I never betrayed.
[14:01.58]Yeah, I can say that.
[14:04.53]Yeah.
[14:05.77]I think so.
[14:07.62]That's all.
[14:08.02]Thank you very much.
[14:10.72]Chaotic Neutral!
[14:12.44]Please wait here for a while.
[14:18.02]Hello, Jeremy.
[14:20.12]Thank you for waiting.
[14:22.86]I was explaining the type of trainer you are to the trainer assistant, and we were laughing our asses off.
[14:32.72]What?
[14:35.88]I'm a trainer assistant.
[14:39.36]Cultia, native place Galoa.
[14:42.40]The exam pass date.
[14:43.66]The exam score, 92 out of 100.
[14:45.10]A little bit hasty.
[14:49.60]Okay.
[14:51.46]She is the trainer assistant who is going to your place.
[14:55.64]She's still a bit childish, but she sure is a good girl.
[14:59.16]Here she is.
[15:00.36]Cultia.
[15:03.94]How do you do, Jeremy?
[15:05.06]I'm
[15:06.58]Fucking colitis.
[15:08.71]Please call me Colt.
[15:12.11]You're gonna work with her for quite some time, so please try to get along with each other.
[15:15.75]Do your best to raise a monster well so that it can win the major four.
[15:21.24]I'm looking forward to your performance.
[15:24.48]Yes, sir.
[15:25.94]Well, Jeremy, let's do our best.
[15:27.68]First, you should obtain a monster at the market in the town.
[15:31.80]Thank you!
[15:41.13]Alright.
[15:45.36]Did you see that information there?
[15:47.50]I'm still a rookie!
[15:49.78]And Jeremy, you too, have just become a trainer, right?
[15:53.98]Is there anything you would like to ask about?
[15:55.72]I think I know about everything.
[15:56.74]I pretty much know about everything.
[15:58.61]Yeah.
[15:59.59]No!
[15:59.87]God damn it!
[16:02.86]Trainer assistants are individuals who are trained... I already know what this is.
[16:05.99]We played the first one.
[16:08.65]No more.
[16:11.21]Are you done?
[16:12.03]Yes.
[16:13.81]Then let's go find our monster.
[16:18.36]So, for the purposes of... because we just played the last game last week, we kind of have to put... kind of have to put the Monster Rancher 1 disk in first, right?
[16:29.92]Let's go to the shrine.
[16:32.05]Excuse me.
[16:33.41]Is this your first time visiting the shrine?
[16:36.05]What's your name?
[16:38.15]Colt.
[16:38.61]And this is Jeremy.
[16:39.95]I'm Charlie, a priestess of the shrine.
[16:44.22]We've reproduced monsters using disk stones, CD, and Slate's backup data of Monster Rancher.
[16:49.14]Wait, what?
[16:52.48]Which kind of rep... Wait, I... Can I... I can pull out stuff from the first game?
[17:01.84]I'm gonna see.
[17:02.36]Let's see here.
[17:03.46]I'm just curious.
[17:05.60]Yeah, you can do a game transfer.
[17:14.50]I just wanna see who falls out.
[17:21.59]Okay, yeah, we can bring Edgehog, Jax, Rex, Luis...
[17:26.72]You are not allowed to reproduce this monster.
[17:28.56]I don't know who that is.
[17:29.66]DNA food de-sponges back.
[17:34.81]Nah.
[17:35.77]Sorry, guys.
[17:36.69]This is a new game.
[17:39.51]New game, new shit.
[17:40.68]Let's extract some DNA.
[17:47.00]From a disk stone.
[17:49.20]Insert the CD in.
[17:49.93]Okay, so here's what's going in first.
[17:55.51]So I was trying to scrounge for CDs.
[17:57.55]You can't use DVDs in a PlayStation 1.
[18:00.61]So I was scrounging around for CDs that I could actually work with the system here, right?
[18:06.92]So here's a Seagate disk utility software for an old fucking Seagate hard drive.
[18:18.33]Okay, let's see what happens.
[18:24.89]Although, wait, we're supposed to do Monster Rancher 1 first, but that's boring.
[18:27.95]I'd rather see what comes out of this fucking little utility data.
[18:33.11]Alright, let's see.
[18:38.76]It's gonna be a legendary monster.
[18:47.13]Not Western Digital.
[18:50.05]I mean, come on, man.
[18:53.31]Do you understand?
[18:54.88]That this is probably from a PC build or something that I did.
[18:59.30]More than 15 years ago.
[19:00.70]Or 10 years ago.
[19:01.48]No, actually, this is 2011 Seagate technology.
[19:06.60]So, I mean, it had to have been in the last 10 years, right?
[19:11.48]Let's see what it gives us.
[19:14.01]I'm excited.
[19:20.38]The next one is even worse, but I'm not even sure it's gonna work.
[19:25.98]Okay.
[19:31.17]What are we gonna get?
[19:37.73]Well, it's definitely a cooler... I don't know if I'd say cooler, actually.
[19:40.55]That hurts my head.
[19:41.19]Oh, it's like a fat rabbit!
[19:49.35]It's a green rabbit with jiggle bones in his stomach.
[19:54.81]That thing sucks.
[19:58.21]Is it supposed to be that fat?
[19:59.91]Cute.
[20:00.81]Yes, it's a very cute monster.
[20:03.42]Do you want to take this monster to your ranch?
[20:07.30]No.
[20:08.64]Which kind of reproduction do you want?
[20:10.82]Disk.
[20:12.64]Okay, this next one... This next one is in the same realm.
[20:18.73]Make sure there's no CD key on here.
[20:22.79]No, this is not.
[20:24.25]But is this a... It's a Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium disk.
[20:28.90]I don't know if this is going to work, though.
[20:33.10]I think this is... I can't do DVDs, right?
[20:36.00]I don't think this is going to work.
[20:43.34]DVDs can't go in there.
[20:45.45]But I know something that can go in there.
[20:46.99]It's going to be a really funny meme for all of us.
[20:49.33]I found this and I was like, oh, that's fucking kind of cool.
[20:52.53]It's been a while since we've seen the Neurostory Electrodump from Metal Gear.
[20:57.40]Right?
[20:58.36]Metal Gear!
[20:59.04]I found it!
[21:00.58]It was in an old box.
[21:02.66]Let's give it a try.
[21:03.36]Let's see what it is.
[21:10.07]I'm ready.
[21:12.63]Is this a DVD?
[21:13.43]I don't fucking know.
[21:15.25]This might be a DVD.
[21:19.49]And the rare chance this isn't a DVD, let's find out.
[21:27.76]Nah, it's a fucking DVD.
[21:29.16]Shit!
[21:33.19]I thought the chances could have been a CD.
[21:34.81]Alright, well then, what is this one?
[21:36.83]There we go.
[21:37.39]Well, here.
[21:39.32]Next.
[21:40.34]Resident Evil 2.
[21:43.18]The original Resident Evil 2 disk for PlayStation 1.
[21:45.83]It's gonna be a zombie.
[21:57.81]I just want something.
[22:00.48]You know how difficult it is to find a CD?
[22:04.34]I don't have any CDs.
[22:05.58]I have PlayStation 1.
[22:06.52]I have PC games that are in here that are junk.
[22:12.81]But man, everything's on a DVD-R or a Blu-Ray now.
[22:16.45]Let's see what we get from Resident Evil 2.
[22:21.79]I got a feeling we're going to keep this one for a little while.
[22:24.25]We still have to do Monster Hunter 1.
[22:31.19]It's not difficult to find CDs?
[22:32.40]Yeah, it is.
[22:34.71]Look, I'm in the digital age.
[22:35.65]You understand?
[22:37.92]I don't carry cash.
[22:39.72]I don't have digital... I don't have physical copies of anything.
[22:43.04]I buy all my games digitally.
[22:44.70]I only have my debit card.
[22:46.58]I don't carry anything.
[22:48.18]I live in the digital goddamn world.
[22:49.48]I don't have CDs anymore.
[22:54.41]Resident Evil 2.
[22:54.79]What have we got?
[22:59.01]It's Edgehog.
[23:00.43]Again.
[23:10.71]Cute!
[23:11.55]Oh yes, it's very cute.
[23:15.04]He's got actually pretty good power.
[23:16.20]Do you want to take this monster to your ranch?
[23:17.80]Yes.
[23:23.63]Oh, why did I do that?
[23:24.51]No, no, no, no.
[23:29.13]Pledge to the edge.
[23:35.95]I don't wanna- do I have to name it Edgehog 2?
[23:38.63]Why the fuck am I doing this?
[23:40.83]I'm going to regret this, but I'm gonna do it just for fun.
[23:44.53]Whoops.
[23:52.24]It's alright.
[23:52.68]It can be- it can be Edgyogog.
[23:56.52]Edgy- no, it's Edgyog2.
[23:58.64]I like that better.
[24:01.45]Edgyog2.
[24:07.28]Yeah, he pretty much has the name of a... NVIDIA graphics card.
[24:15.55]There.
[24:20.45]I'll register it with this name, sure.
[24:21.89]Thank you.
[24:24.29]Okay.
[24:25.21]Let's go to the lab.
[24:26.29]Let's freeze him.
[24:28.79]I don't- I'm not using this guy.
[24:32.69]It's a Gatorade?
[24:35.65]The Egeo G2.
[24:40.01]It's the new coffee drink from Gatorade.
[24:45.01]It's coffee, it's hydration, and it's protein.
[24:49.09]Egeo G2.
[24:49.67]That guy just asked me if I wanted cocaine.
[24:54.87]So which would you like?
[24:56.95]Oh, freeze.
[24:58.13]Analyze, let's analyze him.
[25:00.23]Egeo G2, hmm, that's, uh, hmm.
[25:02.83]Giving up is not in its nature.
[25:05.15]Do you want to continue analyzing?
[25:06.61]Yes.
[25:08.35]It has no additional characteristics, it just doesn't give up.
[25:14.53]Into the fucking freezer with you.
[25:18.43]Well, that looks worse than the last game.
[25:21.55]Okay, let's get another disk.
[25:22.93]We need to get a monster that's not a basic piece of shit.
[25:25.91]Um, what have we got?
[25:29.27]I know I have like a bunch of things here.
[25:30.63]Alright, we're gonna put in... Let's try this one.
[25:40.81]It died?
[25:41.33]It's not dead.
[25:43.29]We have to get at least something somewhat interesting.
[25:45.19]I'm gonna put in one of our many FMV games that I own.
[25:48.39]This is Murder in the First Degree.
[25:50.96]Remember we played this one like a year ago?
[25:54.90]Thousands of colors.
[25:57.68]Did I make this joke already?
[26:00.29]I may have.
[26:02.09]Let's make it again, because who cares?
[26:03.59]It's been a year.
[26:06.31]There it is.
[26:07.19]Murder in the... in the first degree.
[26:11.11]If you can see there.
[26:13.23]Thousands of colors.
[26:16.97]Interesting stuff.
[26:17.73]Let's give it a try.
[26:22.31]Put in 700,000 games.
[26:23.63]You know, that's not a bad idea.
[26:24.85]The only problem is I need to know where it is.
[26:28.20]I don't know where that is.
[26:30.14]You guys see how I trade some of these things.
[26:31.54]I like throw discs behind my back all the fucking time.
[26:36.24]It could be buried somewhere.
[26:38.42]I buried my trash, so it could be buried somewhere.
[26:44.91]So this is the first degree.
[26:50.55]Did I snap it as a joke?
[26:51.79]No.
[26:53.11]Why would I do that?
[26:58.80]I'm sure it's some special monster if you put it in the first disk.
[27:01.88]Something like that.
[27:07.88]Check behind you?
[27:09.34]How do I clean this room?
[27:10.86]I don't just... I don't just throw shit behind me and then leave it there for... No, that's not true.
[27:17.05]That's a lie.
[27:18.55]But, I mean, it's... I made that video a year ago.
[27:22.59]It's not still behind me from me throwing it behind me.
[27:27.25]This is a rare monster!
[27:30.79]Wait, what?
[27:32.65]This rare monster can be reproduced only by an authorized Aima trainer.
[27:36.81]Please come again.
[27:39.04]What?
[27:40.64]What does that mean?
[27:41.40]What are you talking about?
[27:42.14]Alright, hold on to this one.
[27:49.08]Where is it?
[27:49.90]Murder in the First Degree.
[27:52.78]Keep track of this one.
[27:53.70]We're going to keep track of the discs that we have to keep track of by going in the WWF The Music Volume 3 container.
[28:01.30]Keep that one for safekeeping.
[28:05.55]We still need a monster, though.
[28:06.61]I don't...
[28:14.21]We got the prices right.
[28:15.17]Yeah, we're gonna put in the prices right.
[28:18.46]Did I even play this game on stream?
[28:22.56]Here is the next one going in.
[28:24.34]Prices right.
[28:26.40]Take a look at that shine.
[28:27.28]Yeah.
[28:30.22]It's going in.
[28:30.64]I don't even know if I played this game on stream.
[28:34.57]I think I did.
[28:36.99]The music's already making me mad.
[28:40.11]Hello?
[28:40.71]Oh, wait.
[28:41.25]Oh, okay.
[28:43.60]That's the thing about these Monster Rancher games, man.
[28:46.16]They just make you angry with their terrible music.
[28:49.50]But you have to deal with it.
[28:50.80]That's part of being a Monster Rancher.
[28:53.98]I have a band that plays behind me all day.
[28:57.19]And there's nothing you can do.
[28:59.17]This is how you determine who's a trainer and who's just one of the boys, you know what I mean?
[29:07.73]That's not a CD.
[29:08.65]This is a DVD.
[29:10.35]Don't even tell me that the price is right from, like, fucking 1997.
[29:12.99]It's a DVD-ROM.
[29:15.71]Make sure I don't lose that one.
[29:17.41]Alright, let's put in Monster Rancher 1.
[29:19.11]It's right here.
[29:23.25]We're gonna get something cool from Monster Rancher 1.
[29:25.29]Guaranteed.
[29:35.24]Put in the SEGA... Yeah, I got a lot of SEGA CD games.
[29:38.63]Let's do the joke, though, because this is the joke, right?
[29:41.64]Why is this a joke?
[29:43.78]We're gonna get something cool.
[29:44.68]It's gonna be an exclusive, limited edition monster from the first game.
[29:49.30]Is this face game in the right place?
[29:55.47]Not really, but who gives a shit?
[29:57.17]Nah, and I just fucked it up.
[30:02.13]Here's the big moment.
[30:07.26]This had better not be another bunny or I'm going to be very upset about this.
[30:13.12]Yeah, I gotta have the face game so I can react to it, right?
[30:19.46]In real time, that's what you guys want to see, right?
[30:20.86]A reaction?
[30:22.45]Ooh, it's a buttery one.
[30:33.47]Curious looking.
[30:35.91]Wait a minute!
[30:45.78]Did we just beat the game?
[30:59.89]Okay.
[31:01.13]Um... Unbeatable.
[31:05.41]Unbuttery.
[31:06.71]Unbutterable.
[31:07.51]Butter... Unbeaterable.
[31:09.36]UNBEATERABLE!
[31:11.36]And we're gonna spell unbeatable with butter.
[31:13.38]So unbeatable, unbutterable.
[31:16.10]Un... Butter... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un... Un...
[31:44.67]Here we go.
[31:50.60]Butterlust.
[31:53.02]No, unbutterleavable.
[31:54.82]I don't know.
[31:55.18]Yeah, un... No.
[31:56.02]Why did I say bloodlust?
[31:56.96]That's not even close.
[31:59.64]Un... Unbutter... Unbeaterleavable.
[32:06.95]Unbutterable.
[32:10.91]I can't... There's only so many spots to put a name here.
[32:17.05]Un... Unbutt-lievable Unbuttle... Unbuttable!
[32:45.46]But lust it's not gonna be but lust alright end of end Now this just doesn't sound right don't matter butter lust oh
[33:13.51]Bloodlust.
[33:14.57]Blooderlust.
[33:15.45]Butter... Bloodlust.
[33:16.75]Butterlust.
[33:17.67]Butterlust.
[33:19.81]There you go.
[33:26.67]So, somebody explain to me why I'm able to do this.
[33:29.41]But I have to have, like, a certificate to pull out the DNA of the CD I just put in.
[33:32.99]Uh, we're gonna freeze this guy.
[33:37.01]Because this is... In case I have any... Um... Yes, how can I help you?
[33:41.36]Let's analyze him first.
[33:43.46]Butterlust.
[33:44.02]Hmm, that's a... It becomes easily enraged.
[33:49.24]Bloodlust, right?
[33:52.60]Let's take a look at his... Can I look at his stats here?
[33:58.34]Because that's an Easter egg monster.
[34:01.91]Let's freeze him.
[34:02.53]We're not gonna... I mean... It's a special disk.
[34:06.19]Alright, what am I gonna do now?
[34:11.19]I feel like we went from 0 to 100 there.
[34:14.20]I just did my huge, like, WHOA reaction.
[34:16.36]I can't do that again.
[34:19.08]Fuck.
[34:21.18]Well, thanks for coming, everybody.
[34:22.52]Um... That was, like, the- that was the reaction.
[34:24.99]You got, like, the fucking crazy, like, streamer reacts to something crazy on screen.
[34:32.97]Alright, what do we got?
[34:35.15]How about... Down here.
[34:37.21]Let's get a SEGA CD game.
[34:39.97]This is- there's so much junk in here.
[34:44.08]What is this one?
[34:47.70]We gotta dig deep down in here.
[34:49.34]We're going deep down in here.
[34:53.65]Ow.
[34:55.07]What's the problem?
[34:55.77]Be careful with these old SEGA CD containers.
[34:57.57]If you're not careful, you'll cut your hand on these because they're so thick and it's like glass.
[35:04.31]These things are made out of glass plastic.
[35:08.56]Okay.
[35:10.26]Let's go with this one.
[35:11.12]We still need a usable monster.
[35:15.32]Okay, this is that terrible boxing game, Prize Fighter.
[35:20.98]You see that?
[35:22.40]Me opening this, I almost just hurt myself opening this.
[35:25.30]Look at that.
[35:28.52]Just be careful if you have these.
[35:31.12]It's dangerous.
[35:31.72]Alright, let's go back.
[35:34.93]Shrine.
[35:35.43]Yep.
[35:40.09]I want to Disk Stone.
[35:43.55]Prize Fighter.
[35:46.90]I'm teetering so many things on my lap right now.
[35:49.26]This is bad news.
[35:50.26]Alright, get it in there.
[35:59.46]Checking the disk.
[36:03.58]Okay, let's look at this.
[36:05.36]Look at this shit.
[36:06.02]Are you seeing this?
[36:10.39]Be fucking careful.
[36:13.41]I could have died right there.
[36:14.55]I could have just died.
[36:20.42]Monsto Rancho, there it is.
[36:21.94]Whoa!
[36:33.56]Okay.
[36:35.42]What did we get from Prizefighter?
[36:41.96]I regret to tell you that this rare monster can be reproduced only by an authorized trainer.
[36:48.47]Oh, God damn it.
[36:49.23]Put it in the box.
[36:51.64]Where is it?
[36:52.64]It was Prizefighter for SEGA CD.
[36:55.70]WWF The Music Volume 3.
[36:56.98]Get it in there.
[37:01.76]What?
[37:02.24]Why?
[37:02.52]I'm like hoarding CDs now.
[37:04.02]This is not good.
[37:04.86]Just give me a fucking monster that's not a pig with a leg or a rabbit.
[37:11.71]Don't give me like a one-legged pig with a giant mouth.
[37:14.31]Alright, this is...
[37:20.61]This is Ground Zero Texas.
[37:23.41]This game was terrible, but great at the same time.
[37:30.77]No more... Just give me a monster that's not a bunny or a stand-up pig monster.
[37:36.02]Alright, here we go.
[37:46.25]Ground Zero Texas.
[37:48.37]SEGA CD.
[37:49.45]Let's open it.
[37:55.42]See?
[37:57.80]You think it's a joke.
[38:01.02]Imagine if a small child had done that.
[38:03.06]Imagine if a small fucking two-year-old had just done what I just did.
[38:06.60]Oh, that's a hospital trip.
[38:18.43]Alright.
[38:19.73]This is Ground Zero, Texas.
[38:27.21]Don't give me a rare monster that I have to put into the box.
[38:31.87]Just give me something we can start the game with.
[38:33.85]Although I'm having a good time, it's been fun.
[38:35.81]It's always fun seeing what's on the CD.
[38:43.68]Checking the CD now.
[38:44.26]Okay.
[38:53.14]I feel like I'm sitting there waiting for toast when I'm playing Monster Rancher.
[38:57.22]You guys ever do that?
[38:58.00]You sit there and just like staring into the toaster oven or into the toaster and what seems to be four hours is like 30 to 40 seconds.
[39:08.58]Depends on how long does it take.
[39:09.34]What do you guys like toast?
[39:10.12]You guys like really dark crispy toast or do you like slightly underdone toast?
[39:14.26]See to me, I'm actually like a slightly underdone toast kind of guy.
[39:18.75]So I sit there and, you know, it only takes about 12 seconds in a toaster, or if you have a toaster oven, maybe two minutes.
[39:25.04]I like the bread a little spongy with a little bit of crust on the outside.
[39:29.18]You like it dark and crispy?
[39:31.64]I'm not a dark and crispy toast kind of guy.
[39:33.84]I'm not a dark and crispy cookie kind of guy either.
[39:36.91]I am a chewy cookie, soft, underdone toast bread kind of guy.
[39:42.09]Don't give me a bunny.
[39:50.50]Okay.
[39:52.54]I can work with this.
[39:58.58]Let's go.
[40:03.63]C-cute monster.
[40:05.97]I've never seen this before.
[40:08.99]Neither have I. Well, anyway, it's obvious that this is a new monster.
[40:12.53]I'll register this with Aima.
[40:14.44]Yes.
[40:16.02]He sucks.
[40:17.10]Holy shit, this is so bad.
[40:20.31]24 and 49 power why this is so bad this thing sucks Alright, what is this thing?
[40:38.27]This is this is shit.
[40:38.95]This is okay.
[40:39.87]This is like the Minecraft bug update What would it have what kind of name would it have?
[40:58.08]Blocklust.
[40:59.51]Bloodlust.
[41:02.55]Minecraft bug.
[41:03.47]Yeah, I mean... How about... Block... Blocktilda.
[41:11.55]That sucks.
[41:17.25]Blockapede?
[41:18.05]That's not bad.
[41:23.86]Block...
[41:28.09]He's like a slug.
[41:30.07]The blug.
[41:31.91]Yeah, he's like a blug.
[41:33.73]Blug.
[41:34.07]B-L.
[41:37.38]B-L.
[41:40.58]Block slug.
[41:41.36]B-L.
[41:41.84]But he's a centipede, too.
[41:42.80]He's kind of like a... The blug.
[41:48.56]The blug.
[41:50.66]Block bug.
[41:55.91]No, that's like a blog.
[41:57.69]No, blog.
[41:58.49]A blog?
[42:02.05]Blog is just stupid enough where it's easy to say.
[42:05.21]It's easy to retweet, you know what I mean?
[42:06.59]Like, blog.
[42:07.15]That's a good website.
[42:09.51]Uh, blog.
[42:15.17]I'm not gonna do blog plug.
[42:16.89]Sorry, guys.
[42:20.09]Although...
[42:33.15]Blug.
[42:33.51]I like Blug.
[42:36.81]That's good.
[42:38.95]We're gonna delete this guy anyways.
[42:40.09]He's got 40 power!
[42:41.63]I'm not gonna be able to hurt anybody!
[42:46.16]No, it's name is Blug.
[42:47.64]I'll register it with the name.
[42:49.04]Okay, yeah.
[42:50.08]Registered.
[42:50.76]Good.
[42:51.52]Good!
[42:54.50]We're gonna work with this guy even though he's the wolf.
[42:59.48]Let's take a look at him.
[43:01.10]Monster.
[43:02.92]Everything is atrocious.
[43:06.23]He is a style-even, form-normal nature good.
[43:11.07]He likes to play and he dislikes fish.
[43:14.45]He has tail swing and face attack.
[43:20.46]They both have a very high hit percentage.
[43:27.58]Face attack sounds really great.
[43:28.96]This is so bad.
[43:29.74]I don't even want to train this fucking stupid... This guy is pretty much like the equivalent of a block stride gum.
[43:40.09]There's four pieces.
[43:43.39]I should have named this guy, like, Nicorette Gum.
[43:49.71]Instead of Blug.
[43:53.12]Let's just take him to the ranch and just fuck with him for a little while.
[44:05.50]Yeah, he's like a chiclet.
[44:17.98]Which food do you want?
[44:18.80]He doesn't like fish.
[44:21.18]Potato, milk.
[44:22.17]There's lots of different choices now.
[44:24.95]Cup of jelly.
[44:27.07]Meat.
[44:28.29]Tablet.
[44:29.85]This ill-tasting food is high in protein, nutrition, and calories.
[44:35.29]Nutritious but not filling and is intended for baby monsters.
[44:38.43]Let's see if he's a baby.
[44:41.07]First of all, let me just get to a couple of bits that came in here that I saw.
[44:45.83]Kairotopi, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[44:49.92]Thank you so much, dude.
[44:52.08]D-Sponge or Riot?
[44:53.72]D-Sponge... No, we can't.
[44:55.40]We gotta do new monsters.
[44:56.56]It's a new game.
[44:57.68]It's a new world.
[44:59.30]But thank you so much, dude.
[45:01.60]For the 5,000 bits.
[45:06.57]And also thank you to KXC501 for the 20 bucks.
[45:09.75]It's a monster hype.
[45:10.75]Thank you, KXC.
[45:13.93]No, stop.
[45:14.49]No, nobody riot.
[45:15.75]Don't riot.
[45:16.57]Don't do it.
[45:17.39]It's not going to happen.
[45:18.23]We're going to feed this guy milk.
[45:20.19]We're feeding our baby.
[45:21.41]We're feeding our baby nicotine gum.
[45:25.73]Milk.
[45:29.07]We left it.
[45:34.74]What the fuck just happened?
[45:43.77]It's three?
[45:44.45]Wait, is it three people?
[45:46.97]I'm so confused.
[45:47.99]It's three different monsters.
[45:51.15]It's a human centipede.
[45:53.72]Don't... What the fuck?
[45:58.34]Oh my god.
[45:59.48]Now we know where he got the idea from the movie.
[46:06.02]Jeremy, this is Master...
[46:23.35]I can't I don't know if I'm really get over this one nice He was the greatest trainer ever.
[46:29.13]Stop it.
[46:29.91]Oh, yeah, Jeremy.
[46:31.13]Oh keep up with the good work.
[46:34.05]I Have to go now.
[46:34.84]I have an appointment Master Pabst used to be the number one trainer among IMA.
[46:39.70]I know he doesn't look like that.
[46:42.78]Oh Yeah, yeah blog is very well Mm-hmm.
[46:48.48]Oh They're very very organized
[46:52.76]Okay, training.
[46:53.90]Let's see how different this is than the last game.
[46:57.42]We've got rest, training, battle, training, drill, or errantry?
[47:04.74]Let me see here.
[47:06.71]During the errantry, your monster can learn new techniques and improve its abilities more than it would improve drill.
[47:14.43]However, differing from drill, the... See, look at how exhausted the guy in the middle is.
[47:25.86]That guy has, that guy's got it the worst.
[47:28.98]Every so often they get to take a minute to let the guy in the middle have a little bit of a fucking break.
[47:39.20]Okay, okay, now we need to go.
[47:41.02]I have a different route from-
[47:49.86]He's so sad!
[47:50.76]Oh my god, the Errantry will take four weeks to finish.
[47:56.21]And you'll have to pay a fee.
[47:58.11]Okay, so it's the same thing as... ...what it was in the last one.
[48:00.95]It's the big, it's the pay-for one.
[48:02.25]Drill is just... ...what we're used to.
[48:05.36]So what the hell do I want to do with this guy?
[48:07.06]He's got no power, no intelligence.
[48:11.38]He's useless.
[48:12.26]Just power?
[48:12.82]I don't even know what the fuck I want to do here.
[48:19.55]Should I do power?
[48:21.96]Power and defense?
[48:23.16]I don't even know, man.
[48:24.82]Everything, he's so useless.
[48:26.12]Well, that's why you train him.
[48:32.76]Yeah, but I mean, look at the other two or three monsters we made so far.
[48:35.18]They were at like 150.
[48:35.56]100, like 120, 150.
[48:35.76]This dude is fucking hopeless.
[48:46.19]Alright, let's just see how many we get.
[48:48.57]How many points we get for doing this once.
[48:52.41]Okay, so it's different now.
[48:53.63]It's not just a little animated scene.
[48:56.11]I kind of miss the animated scene.
[49:00.89]Plus one power.
[49:03.15]Ay-yi-yi.
[49:08.02]Plug as well.
[49:11.56]Oh man, I don't know about this one.
[49:19.77]Let's do... What happens in the end of Human Centipede?
[49:27.54]I haven't seen that movie in a long time.
[49:32.84]Skill and life?
[49:34.51]At this point, intelligence is absolutely hopeless.
[49:39.59]Let me just see.
[49:41.03]Let's just do a battle.
[49:46.96]and get disk chips.
[49:48.36]Let's just have him fight.
[49:49.52]I want to see how the moves are.
[49:53.55]Participate.
[49:54.55]I don't want to waste any payments or any money on this guy.
[50:01.87]If the moves are there, then we'll continue.
[50:07.64]Because we're about to go drop this guy.
[50:09.38]We're about to drop this guy off at the farm, as they say.
[50:14.54]He bought the farm, as they say.
[50:17.22]See, spring, my favorite fucking season.
[50:25.40]Here we are in the Parepare Arena.
[50:29.24]It's only spring, but it already feels like summer.
[50:31.01]Yeah, under this circumstance, spring carnival is now beginning.
[50:33.69]Is he going to get fucked over with five loyalty?
[50:37.41]Yeah, I know he is, but I just want to see what the moves do.
[50:40.01]I want to see if this is worth my time.
[50:41.21]Got a guy named, like, Sakura Art and Palmer...
[50:47.44]The millennial.
[50:48.80]I got my little human centipede blood person.
[50:51.63]Okay.
[50:55.73]Polymer's moved on.
[50:56.57]Let's just see what he does.
[50:57.41]Alright, let's battle.
[51:03.68]Give him... No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[51:05.38]Good luck.
[51:06.22]Oh, no.
[51:06.42]Okay.
[51:07.26]So, does it play just like the last one?
[51:16.61]He's so happy.
[51:18.66]He's so- but look at- see what I'm talking about?
[51:20.50]Look at how much we're- It probably plays the same.
[51:23.86]Okay, well.
[51:31.71]Does it not play the same?
[51:34.51]Tail swing.
[51:35.37]Um, he's getting booed.
[51:36.15]Alright, it's not L and R to move this time.
[51:38.51]It's just forward and back.
[51:46.05]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[51:47.55]Face attack.
[51:48.64]Do the face attack.
[51:55.74]See, everybody hates this thing.
[51:57.00]If I get one hit, I might win.
[52:01.89]49%.
[52:08.45]Yeah, these moves are terrible too.
[52:14.53]That was a 76% chance to hit.
[52:20.72]One hit, come on.
[52:22.42]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[52:30.72]Well.
[52:39.02]Uh, he's gone.
[52:42.18]You know, I'll do you guys one more.
[52:46.81]Maybe one of those moves was cool or something.
[52:50.73]We're gonna freeze him.
[52:52.82]I don't want to put a bunch of money into this dude.
[52:55.32]Just drop out of the tournament.
[52:57.12]Just drop out of the tournament and go to hell.
[53:08.40]And punish.
[53:09.25]No.
[53:11.63]We're gonna fuse him later.
[53:17.42]It's the first time I've ever dropped out of a tournament in Monster Ranch.
[53:25.54]This is the result of the tournament.
[53:29.64]Here's the prize money.
[53:30.70]Nothing.
[53:33.88]He didn't know new fans.
[53:35.26]Fuse him with butt lust.
[53:39.72]No.
[53:42.47]We need to get a monster.
[53:44.17]That'll be like a funny later on down.
[53:45.86]Look, we're going to play this game for at least a few streams.
[53:49.12]I love Monster Rancher.
[53:49.98]The game's awesome.
[53:50.60]We're going to play this one for a little while.
[53:53.04]Keep this guy in the pocket.
[53:54.76]And then when we get a cool monster, maybe we'll fuse him with the human centipede and we'll get something even more ridiculous.
[54:02.49]Right?
[54:06.95]It's disappointing.
[54:11.84]Blug seems pretty tired.
[54:13.24]Give it some rest.
[54:15.10]Sure.
[54:16.46]How does an eternal rest sound?
[54:20.24]That was mean.
[54:21.15]That was really mean.
[54:22.17]That was not even funny.
[54:22.99]That was just like, that was just pure mean.
[54:28.29]That was not even nice.
[54:31.77]No, he's just gonna go to sleep in some ice for like a few years.
[54:38.80]Freeze him.
[54:44.59]I wonder if it detaches.
[54:47.56]They turn into four cubes.
[54:51.60]I have nothing else to drink.
[54:52.76]God damn it.
[54:54.54]Okay.
[54:56.04]Let's make this happen again.
[54:59.32]This time, we're going to use the Mansion of Hidden Souls.
[55:03.02]This is another SEGA CD game.
[55:06.85]This one was already out of its package, essentially.
[55:12.13]Here it is, if you'd like to see it.
[55:17.76]Take a CD.
[55:21.42]There it is.
[55:23.80]Something that's not useless.
[55:27.17]I would like that.
[55:32.83]Too much ice that they put in coffees nowadays.
[55:34.95]You notice that?
[55:37.03]This is a large coffee from Dunkin' Donuts.
[55:40.47]And this is probably as small as worth of liquid in here and then a bag of ice.
[55:50.09]Like, annoyed by this.
[55:50.95]I just got that, like, not even... Like, I just got that, like, three hours ago.
[56:07.44]Ask for no ice.
[56:10.21]Yeah, but the problem when you get no ice, right?
[56:12.14]I like cold iced coffee.
[56:15.52]So when you get no ice, you end up with this lukewarm room temperature coffee in 10 minutes.
[56:22.52]And it's not good.
[56:23.92]If you drink coffee that's not, it's got to be either really fucking hot or really cold.
[56:28.30]The only two ways I like to drink coffee.
[56:30.40]Anything in between, instant gag puke reflex.
[56:34.13]That's not true, but you know, you understand.
[56:36.59]You know what I'm saying.
[56:40.30]He got out of the Frieza.
[56:50.34]That's a unique monster.
[56:52.92]Man.
[56:54.48]Unique that he was able to fucking climb out.
[57:13.19]put him back in he got out put him back in can I just have a monster that's not a piece of shit please put him back in
[57:41.98]Join them together.
[57:42.82]Hold on, I gotta... Careful.
[57:49.73]The next SEGA CD game... Ooh, don't... These are heavy, too.
[57:52.71]These are heavy.
[57:53.41]They weigh like four pounds each.
[57:59.22]Like, this could be used as a weapon.
[58:02.54]You know, some people, oh yeah, I got a baseball bat next to my bed.
[58:07.12]No, dude, just take like a SEGA CD disk case and just put it under your pillow.
[58:12.02]Somebody breaks in, you could just like smash their face with this and it would break their nose and blow up their whole mouth and stuff.
[58:18.60]This thing's like at least two pounds.
[58:22.48]This is my defense right here.
[58:25.02]Seriously.
[58:25.38]Alright, go back.
[58:47.40]Easy.
[58:49.93]Lethal Enforcers 2, Gunfighter.
[58:51.23]Snake City.
[58:58.57]People think that's a joke.
[58:59.37]It's not.
[58:59.75]Opening these up is actually pretty dangerous.
[59:09.90]Why is this pre-recorded?
[59:15.61]Old material?
[59:16.41]Old material?
[59:17.23]Like, you mean from 10 minutes ago?
[59:18.79]The old... Wait, hold on a second.
[59:23.62]You don't watch a TV show.
[59:26.04]Hold that thought.
[59:27.10]You watch TV, right?
[59:28.02]You watch movies.
[59:29.28]That's like saying, saying that's old material.
[59:31.92]That's like going to a comedy movie.
[59:34.28]And in the first like hour of the comedy movie, something, somebody makes a joke and you laugh at it.
[59:39.15]You're in the theater.
[59:39.71]You're like, oh, wait, he stubbed his toe and then he fell down the mountain.
[59:43.83]Oh my God.
[59:44.45]That's fucking funny.
[59:45.71]And then an hour later, the same actor
[59:48.93]Falls down another falls down a well or something and you're in the middle of theater the same fucking movie that you the same the same hour And you look up at the screen falls down the well and you scream in the theater.
[60:00.06]That's old material Already saw that one This is same fucking movie you know what you got you know what you came you know what you paid for The guy's gonna fall down a couple times Where are we?
[60:18.00]Well, somebody makes like a joke.
[60:19.42]Somebody makes a relevant joke in the movie.
[60:22.14]And then an hour later, the joke is referenced.
[60:24.68]And you're like, that's all material.
[60:26.28]No, it's like fucking the same goddamn show.
[60:43.25]It's just like you're watching the same fucking show right now.
[60:47.89]That would be old material if I did that like six months ago.
[60:56.03]We got the fucking alien from Mac in me.
[60:58.31]It's staying.
[61:07.60]Very energetic.
[61:09.48]Ooh.
[61:10.00]Mm-hmm.
[61:15.54]See, that's what I'm talking about.
[61:16.50]Look at that skill.
[61:18.62]Look at the intelligence and the skill.
[61:23.68]Good name here.
[61:24.64]Um, hmm.
[61:30.22]He's like a gremlin.
[61:31.06]He's a gremlin.
[61:32.22]He's like an alien.
[61:35.18]Why does everything have to be like one word and then the next word?
[61:37.58]Gremlin.
[61:38.60]Grelian.
[61:39.54]No, it doesn't have to be like... Don't compound word it.
[61:42.06]Just make it something cool.
[61:46.78]Um...
[61:50.94]We're gonna play with this guy for a little while, so probably like... I gotta see him again.
[62:06.98]No, I can't see him.
[62:10.98]He's got horns that are kind of like unicorn horns on each side.
[62:14.78]He's pink.
[62:15.98]He's funny.
[62:17.28]He's like a Furby.
[62:19.74]He's funny.
[62:24.54]No, but even though... No, he's all... It's all material.
[62:27.00]Name him the Lich King.
[62:32.02]No, we're gonna name him... Uh... Ger... Ger... How about Jerm?
[62:41.43]Jerma.
[62:42.23]Okay.
[63:02.56]Stein?
[63:10.65]No, not Stein.
[63:13.57]I'm gonna name him New Material.
[63:20.60]S-T-E-I-N.
[63:21.74]What's the mug?
[63:24.25]R.L.
[63:24.61]Stine.
[63:25.49]See?
[63:26.49]Exactly.
[63:27.55]He's a fucked up alien.
[63:31.18]He's an alien.
[63:32.24]And he's all weird.
[63:33.44]It's fucking Stine.
[63:34.60]For R.L.
[63:35.22]Stine.
[63:38.08]I knew I had the right idea.
[63:48.59]I'm looking forward to this guy.
[63:50.73]Bring him to the ranch.
[63:53.88]Let's see what he likes to eat.
[63:58.64]R.L.
[63:58.80]Stine.
[63:59.85]It's not, wait, what do you mean it's Stine?
[64:01.87]Did I, no, it's not.
[64:04.55]Is it, hold on, R.L.
[64:06.51]Stine.
[64:11.85]Yeah, it is R.L.
[64:13.41]Stine.
[64:15.17]I did it right, it's not that spelling.
[64:20.05]It is not R.L.
[64:21.04]S-T-E-I-N.
[64:24.08]Look it up.
[64:24.60]I'm looking it up right now.
[64:26.56]He's 74.
[64:27.16]He's from Columbus.
[64:34.82]Why is it taking so long to load?
[64:41.83]Oh, god damn it.
[64:42.49]Did R.L.
[64:43.05]Stine break the computer?
[64:47.11]Come on.
[64:48.55]Don't get stuck in a loading loop here.
[64:58.65]Damn it.
[65:02.03]Don't do this, come on.
[65:08.40]It's not softlocked, is it?
[65:11.44]PlayStation 1... Okay, I just opened the disk and closed it.
[65:15.18]I opened the tray.
[65:25.25]Oh no, this is not good.
[65:31.80]You know why this is not good?
[65:32.70]Because this game, the game was never saved.
[65:40.18]Hold on, wait.
[65:41.52]I think I have an idea.
[65:47.99]There it is, right?
[65:49.21]Monster Rancher 2.
[65:56.33]Sorry, this is a bit, I got a micro cloth shirt.
[66:02.75]Maybe it's because I got my greasy fucking peanut butter hands on it.
[66:05.51]Maybe that's what happened.
[66:06.75]Come on.
[66:09.62]I think it's because I had my peanut butter fingers touching it.
[66:35.61]One more try.
[66:36.07]Come on.
[66:59.10]Do it.
[67:12.42]We've got to redo the whole game, by the way.
[67:18.22]It's not, you know, this is okay because we spent, we just spent a lot of time making monsters and looking at stuff.
[67:23.80]We already know we're taking Stein.
[67:25.60]So we're just going to, I'm going to, we're going to skip everything.
[67:28.46]The personality test doesn't matter.
[67:30.68]If I was doing a real personality test, I'd just do random answers.
[67:37.10]Old material, game issues and tech issues, old material.
[67:48.94]Damn it.
[67:53.94]Well, at least we know exactly what we're doing.
[67:57.34]Where is it?
[67:59.34]What was it?
[67:59.82]It was Lethal Enforcers 2?
[68:06.20]Shit.
[68:09.14]Why am I still streaming?
[68:11.48]I've only been streaming for like an hour.
[68:14.93]I'm alright.
[68:15.33]I'm okay with this.
[68:15.93]This is alright.
[68:16.91]We spent the time just making random monsters.
[68:19.15]Now we got the one we're gonna use.
[68:20.71]We didn't do anything.
[68:22.47]You know, I didn't do anything in the game.
[68:24.93]We've been building monsters.
[68:26.57]We've been doing a bunch of old material, you know?
[68:35.86]This is fine.
[68:36.84]Can we... Wait, let's load anything there.
[68:40.27]There might be something there.
[68:41.11]Yeah, nothing.
[68:44.21]It's alright, we can just skip everything.
[68:45.97]Fuck the personality test, doesn't matter.
[68:47.49]I remember all my answers anyways.
[68:48.99]And we'll just go right to Makenstein and start the training.
[68:56.40]I'm actually mad.
[68:57.20]No, I'm not.
[68:57.98]I'm good.
[69:00.74]Just gonna put our name in again.
[69:15.63]Uh-huh, I'm sure.
[69:16.33]Yep, did the personality test.
[69:17.41]We didn't win any tournaments.
[69:18.61]We're fine.
[69:19.77]Okay.
[69:20.61]Unfortunately or fortunately, in this world, money can solve most problems.
[69:23.41]This is a new test.
[69:25.83]This is a new personality test.
[69:27.33]That's not true.
[69:29.89]I have a valuable friend who I never betray.
[69:31.53]Yes.
[69:33.51]When I see people who are in need, I can't ignore them.
[69:35.27]Yes.
[69:37.33]In this world, there's something that I must do at the risk of my own life.
[69:39.49]No.
[69:42.79]When I am absorbed in something, I don't notice what's going on around me.
[69:45.19]Yes, we did.
[69:46.01]At least we can answer these fast.
[69:47.25]I believe that aliens exist.
[69:48.83]Absolutely.
[69:49.87]Because we are the aliens.
[69:51.17]To somebody.
[69:52.40]I think work is more important than romance.
[69:55.16]Woo!
[69:55.74]This is a tough one!
[69:57.12]Hmm.
[69:57.80]This is a tough one.
[70:04.12]Is work more important than... But what is work?
[70:07.51]Is work your passion?
[70:08.97]Hmm.
[70:10.21]What are you passionate about?
[70:11.87]This is a tough question.
[70:13.47]Yes.
[70:16.04]I am the type of person who saves his favorite food.
[70:18.14]No.
[70:20.38]Because passion could be romance.
[70:22.12]Work could be romance, right?
[70:24.78]It takes a lot of work to be romantic and be in a romance, right?
[70:31.16]Work all extreme.
[70:33.32]No, no, no.
[70:34.00]That's not what I'm saying.
[70:34.94]In order to truly succeed, sometimes you need to make a risky choice.
[70:37.68]Yes.
[70:38.22]Thank you.
[70:39.78]When I'm ordered to do something I like, I'm confused.
[70:46.48]When I'm ordered to do something I like, I'm confused.
[70:48.76]No.
[70:48.82]What?
[70:49.79]Alright, wait here.
[70:53.99]We're going to get a new trainer.
[70:54.87]Thanks for waiting.
[70:59.71]I was explaining to you.
[71:00.39]Here they are.
[71:00.87]Okay, here's Kaleida.
[71:03.34]Female.
[71:05.44]A little bit hasty.
[71:06.34]It's the same person.
[71:07.08]Doesn't even matter.
[71:10.80]Here you go.
[71:13.82]He likes the game and he got confused.
[71:16.36]It's the same person.
[71:20.07]Do your best.
[71:21.35]Put in... Get R.L.
[71:23.47]Stine.
[71:23.99]What if R.L.
[71:24.51]Stine is the catalyst here?
[71:26.35]And he'll just forever break the game.
[71:31.10]Still a rookie.
[71:32.66]No more.
[71:34.60]I'm sure.
[71:35.10]Get us to the ranch.
[71:36.62]Go get a monster.
[71:41.16]92 out of 100?
[71:41.50]I got an A. Alright, let me save the game first.
[71:50.04]So we don't have to do that shit again.
[71:54.57]New.
[71:55.95]One block.
[71:56.83]Save it.
[71:59.83]Okay, good.
[72:02.89]Trying.
[72:03.15]Let's give it a go.
[72:03.95]Put it back in.
[72:06.39]I'm not incorrect here.
[72:08.33]It was Lethal Enforcers 2.
[72:09.97]Right?
[72:11.27]I hope so.
[72:19.57]Okay.
[72:25.07]Don't get my Butterfinger hands on it.
[72:27.91]No, I just put in WWF The Music Volume 4.
[72:31.05]That's not the right CD.
[72:32.89]I saw it as it was happening.
[72:34.61]Too late.
[72:38.42]bit the bug back?
[72:42.10]I just picked it up and put it in and I saw what it was.
[72:43.92]It's alright, we'll get Stein again.
[72:59.51]How do you make that mistake?
[73:00.43]Because I put... They're both sitting right next to each other, face down.
[73:04.33]Never put a... Dude, really?
[73:18.69]Um, okay.
[73:21.27]This is not going so well here.
[73:34.34]Okay, here is the big moment.
[73:36.12]Something's not... I think the laser might be having problems.
[73:39.38]We've been taking out and putting in discs on this thing.
[73:42.87]We may have fucking ruined it.
[73:46.75]Because it is having trouble.
[73:56.34]WWF The Music Volume 4 gives us... Huh.
[74:05.63]It's sweet rind is back.
[74:19.59]It's the same exact thing.
[74:21.08]It's Sweet Rhine.
[74:23.80]But it turned into a human.
[74:30.38]Because Sweet Rhine... Well, what was Sweet Rhine?
[74:32.20]Sweet Rhine was Plant Wall.
[74:35.74]So this is Plant... Plant Person or Plant Monkey, right?
[74:43.36]Okay.
[74:44.25]Well, this is awesome.
[74:49.76]Pretty good stats.
[74:50.52]Great defense.
[74:52.54]I'm gonna freeze him.
[74:56.90]I'm gonna name this dude.
[75:07.48]Oh, you could say he's like a gremlin or something, right?
[75:21.20]We better bring back the thing that we probably will get it I'm gonna keep them The flower the flow flowering a tang How about sprout I like sprout
[75:49.57]That's a clean, like, fun name.
[75:51.53]Sprout!
[75:54.20]Name him Flowrilla.
[75:56.00]I'm not... No, he's gonna be Sprout.
[76:04.96]Lame.
[76:05.50]What do you mean lame?
[76:07.77]No, we're not doing compound words anymore, I told you.
[76:10.15]We're trying to move away from that.
[76:17.17]Okay.
[76:18.54]But he's a monkey.
[76:20.54]He's a plant.
[76:23.30]Instead of banana split, banana sprout.
[76:25.87]Done deal.
[76:30.07]You know, like monkeys love bananas.
[76:33.77]He's a plant.
[76:35.03]Banana sprout.
[76:37.86]It's a boring name.
[76:45.88]How do you spell banana?
[76:46.72]B-A-N-A-A?
[76:48.72]No.
[76:49.38]B-A-N-A-A.
[76:53.32]B-A-N-A-A.
[76:55.06]No!
[76:55.48]B-A-N-A-N-A.
[77:04.27]Banana.
[77:09.31]Banana... Sprout.
[77:12.63]Instead of banana split.
[77:19.97]Banana... S?
[77:22.63]We can't fit it.
[77:23.11]Yes, we can.
[77:25.45]Just barely.
[77:27.30]No, it's not Banana Split, it's Banana Sprout!
[77:31.34]I can't fit it.
[77:33.68]I don't know, but... Banana Spit.
[77:37.67]Um... I don't even care.
[77:49.28]No, you gotta have a space.
[77:51.68]Banana spot.
[77:53.20]Banana spit.
[77:55.92]Do monkeys spit?
[77:58.54]Alright, let's do what we came here to do.
[78:01.55]This thing is really cool, though.
[78:11.23]I'm gonna save it.
[78:15.88]Cool.
[78:20.11]Wait, did somebody just say mad cuz bad?
[78:23.29]Why?
[78:23.69]I didn't even do anything.
[78:26.07]Save the game.
[78:28.32]I'm not even like, what am I angry at?
[78:31.20]Oh, mad cuz bad.
[78:32.60]Wait, what did I do?
[78:33.56]I didn't even do anything.
[78:39.56]Save all of this.
[78:44.40]See, now he is a banana split.
[78:45.78]He's gonna be cold.
[78:49.06]Okie doke.
[78:51.17]Let's go get Stain back.
[78:55.81]Okay, wait.
[78:57.05]Please don't fuck it up.
[78:57.87]Let's go get RL Stain.
[79:01.13]Where's that fucking CD?
[79:12.31]Where is it?
[79:12.61]I don't know where it is.
[79:17.27]Where's the Lethal Enforcers 2 CD?
[79:18.56]There it is.
[79:22.56]I gotta pee.
[79:30.71]Watch it be a different monster?
[79:31.75]It might be because it is... Isn't it pulling random data?
[79:35.81]It's a randomly generated code, right?
[79:37.39]It comes from CD data?
[79:39.33]We'll find out.
[79:46.52]Butterlust for fuck's sake.
[79:48.08]No.
[79:53.34]I'm gonna be a little more careful with these discs because it's not... It's not good that we're having laser scanning issues at this point.
[80:06.85]Music's driving me insane.
[80:08.45]Alright, let's see if it is Stein again.
[80:28.19]This will prove to us if it's actually the same seed or not.
[80:34.43]And it is.
[80:35.69]There he is.
[80:36.15]There's Stein.
[80:41.29]R.L.
[80:41.65]Stain.
[80:42.27]Real Stain.
[80:47.91]Buy more CDs for Monster Rancher 3.
[80:49.43]I have a ton of DVDs.
[80:51.09]So we can use that for Monster Rancher 3.
[80:54.51]Great skill.
[80:55.53]Good intelligence.
[81:00.20]Good stamina.
[81:03.28]Yes, I want to take this monster.
[81:12.91]I know it's Stein.
[81:17.19]We need to save it here because something about Stein coming back to the ranch sincerely screws with everything.
[81:24.38]Stein.
[81:24.70]There he is.
[81:26.96]Good.
[81:29.99]File.
[81:31.05]Save.
[81:32.71]Bring him to the ranch.
[81:34.47]And then I'm going to pee.
[81:35.47]And I'll be right back.
[81:42.70]Saving finished.
[81:45.08]To the ranch.
[81:46.40]Let's go.
[81:47.08]Don't hang up in a loading screen.
[81:48.90]Come on.
[81:53.16]Nobody breathe.
[82:08.08]Which food do you want to get?
[82:09.02]Oh shit, I want to look at his data.
[82:10.08]I don't know what he likes.
[82:12.84]He's a baby though, so we're gonna give him milk.
[82:19.93]Do aliens drink milk?
[82:23.53]Here, eat well.
[82:30.64]He does the same stupid rabbit dances.
[82:35.24]Oh, cool.
[82:35.64]Long time no see.
[82:36.56]Master Babs.
[82:37.16]Yeah, Master Dab.
[82:38.70]We made this joke already.
[82:39.82]Old material, guys.
[82:45.23]You can always trust Butterlust.
[82:46.81]I mean, look, he's a guarantee from the Monster Rancher 1 disk.
[82:53.87]Alright.
[82:55.91]So we got intelligence.
[82:56.83]We're going to work on intelligence in life.
[83:00.64]Because he doesn't have a whole lot of it.
[83:03.38]I'm assuming he's pretty int-based.
[83:06.83]Let's see.
[83:07.31]He likes play.
[83:08.15]He dislikes meat.
[83:11.59]So we've got jab and hook.
[83:16.45]Hmm.
[83:18.50]Why is his intelligence so high if he doesn't have any int moves?
[83:21.48]Alright, let's go train...
[83:30.43]Give him some drills.
[83:32.85]Intelligence and life is what we want.
[83:35.57]Defense and life.
[83:41.59]Speed and int.
[83:43.95]Let's see if we can get an intelligence move.
[83:47.47]Give it a go.
[83:50.19]He learns how to read.
[83:51.25]Is he being taught by a bird?
[83:59.43]I don't know what happened there.
[84:03.40]Why is the teacher a parrot?
[84:04.56]Let's do it again.
[84:17.19]Study.
[84:18.01]I'm going to try to get him to 150 intelligence, see if we get an int move.
[84:26.98]I miss the old comic book stuff.
[84:31.80]141.
[84:31.82]Do his attacks use intelligence?
[84:37.51]They don't right now, but he can learn an intelligence move.
[84:41.21]And then it'll obviously work off of his intelligence.
[84:45.95]Let's see.
[84:46.49]Let's do it.
[84:49.99]Is he tired?
[84:51.05]Do it again.
[84:53.49]We'll let him rest after this.
[85:01.65]What does it look like when you fail?
[85:09.47]Honest to God, like... I love how the bird yelling, cawing, and pointing with his hand, and then me thrusting my hips increases my intelligence.
[85:23.60]This seems well.
[85:24.56]Not tired.
[85:26.84]Okay.
[85:28.30]But how... How much is this stuff...
[85:33.58]You have to fill the paper there for the Errantry.
[85:35.74]Write down the name and the trainer's name.
[85:38.84]Yes, this is our first time visiting.
[85:41.62]Not familiar.
[85:44.86]I do know because I played the last game.
[85:51.06]It's a month during that period.
[85:52.28]You're not allowed any contact with the monster.
[85:55.32]You choose a location from five different sites.
[85:57.27]It'll cost you $2,000.
[86:00.27]Some of the cushions are... yeah, yeah, yeah.
[86:02.93]Also, a wild monster appears around here occasionally.
[86:06.68]Yes, it's the monster who attacks monsters during the Errantry.
[86:09.98]If your monster wins, you'll get the prize money.
[86:12.36]Of course, you'll have a chance that your monster will get killed.
[86:15.42]Got enough explanation?
[86:18.55]Okay.
[86:20.53]Don't die.
[86:21.07]So we got intelligence.
[86:23.47]This is what I wanted.
[86:24.11]Okay, intelligence and life.
[86:27.92]It is what I want.
[86:29.70]Hopefully he doesn't die.
[86:31.54]Good luck.
[86:35.76]Seems that your monster will acquire no techniques there.
[86:41.11]Do you want to send your monster to this errand ship?
[86:42.73]Wait, what do you mean no?
[86:43.79]How?
[86:49.30]The fuck is that?
[86:55.28]So wait a minute.
[86:56.52]So why did he have such high intelligence?
[87:07.58]You know what I mean?
[87:08.42]What was the point of his intelligence?
[87:10.76]Being as high as it was base.
[87:12.11]If he doesn't have any intelligence moves, he can learn.
[87:17.59]Stinky.
[87:22.15]Scaly Grass.
[87:23.15]See, I have better names than these guys.
[87:32.97]Uh, no.
[87:33.87]So, what about intelligence in life?
[87:36.16]What about skill?
[87:38.58]Power, speed, skill.
[87:42.48]What about skill in life?
[87:43.76]It seems that there is a chance to acquire a new technique there.
[87:49.84]Let's do this one, then.
[87:53.30]So, do you want to send your monster to this errantry location?
[87:57.26]Level E, right?
[87:59.86]Well, this guy's just a fat version of what I have.
[88:05.95]Let's just do this.
[88:12.82]Go for it.
[88:14.38]First age.
[88:15.34]Watermelon.
[88:19.62]What?
[88:25.27]Sweet Ryan?
[88:27.39]There it is!
[88:29.89]Found it!
[88:36.80]Skill has increased.
[88:42.36]Small raft.
[88:48.43]Jump to it.
[88:51.99]And he... I don't know what that means.
[88:57.57]I think he failed.
[89:02.92]Second stage.
[89:04.12]He gets a couple of tries.
[89:08.14]Come on, time it.
[89:08.58]Go now.
[89:09.84]Go!
[89:13.52]Don't land on the wheel.
[89:16.46]Oh, goddammit.
[89:23.75]Come on, you're wasting time.
[89:25.37]Pass this already.
[89:31.41]Zero intelligence.
[89:32.25]Yeah, well, it doesn't take intelligence to know when to jump.
[89:35.41]He's not gonna get it again.
[89:37.29]Fucking goddammit.
[89:45.19]Well.
[89:46.59]Nice try.
[89:47.49]That was two grand.
[89:49.01]He got a new technique, though.
[89:50.89]Seems pretty strong.
[89:52.29]Yes, praise him.
[89:55.56]That's fine.
[89:55.96]Let's see what it is.
[89:59.36]You're too hard on him.
[90:01.26]He's going to pass out.
[90:03.74]What do we get?
[90:04.22]Okay, we got Flick.
[90:14.59]These are all... Let's let him rest.
[90:22.83]Don't praise him.
[90:23.45]He's a failure.
[90:24.03]I'm too hard on him.
[90:24.87]I don't want him to pass out.
[90:28.53]I gotta pee.
[90:29.95]I forgot to pee.
[90:34.39]Which food do you want to give it?
[90:35.28]Nut, meat?
[90:35.82]Let's give him, uh, fish.
[90:40.44]Wait, does he dislike fish?
[90:42.02]No, that was the last guy.
[90:51.73]So maybe I should just send him to training for intelligence and try to get an int move learned eventually.
[90:58.17]First official tournament, you have to prepare your Stein right away.
[91:02.41]Stein is stressed out.
[91:03.81]We have to take care of it.
[91:06.08]He's pretty tired.
[91:07.32]Give it some rest.
[91:07.96]He just woke up!
[91:11.26]You just woke up!
[91:12.34]Oh my god.
[91:19.41]He's still tired?
[91:20.23]He seems well.
[91:23.21]Alright, so when's the battle?
[91:26.89]Free for all.
[91:27.71]Number of entrance, eight.
[91:31.11]What?
[91:32.53]What does that mean?
[91:36.73]I'm curious.
[91:37.19]We're going to do that in a minute.
[91:38.05]But I got to pee.
[91:38.75]Be right back.
[91:42.81]I just... No, I didn't.
[91:44.08]Good.
[91:46.70]Pee time.
[94:28.87]Hello.
[94:33.73]Let me just dump a drink on my desk.
[94:35.95]Okay.
[94:41.06]Well, the desk is ruined.
[94:42.54]Oh, well.
[94:44.26]Just wanted to see what kind of liquid fall percentage would hit the desk and then the floor.
[94:49.94]Just for fun.
[94:51.58]Oh, but that's actually not cool because I don't know how that happened.
[95:01.86]Hold on.
[95:17.70]I made the joke.
[95:18.40]I feel like it actually kind of happened.
[95:21.69]Fucking old material.
[95:25.93]Can you...
[95:30.73]I love that noise.
[95:31.47]Listen to this.
[95:33.29]This is like a piece of the toilet or something, but just listen to this fucking awesome noise.
[95:40.43]You know what I'm saying?
[95:44.09]Alright, let's go.
[95:52.42]That is an awesome noise.
[96:00.87]Please break something.
[96:02.57]My coordination with objects in my hand is incredible.
[96:07.09]That's not gonna happen.
[96:10.51]But I did actually accidentally dump coffee on my desk.
[96:15.43]My headphones just broke.
[96:19.08]Hold on.
[96:19.62]There's coffee in these headphones.
[96:22.04]How did this happen?
[96:23.62]I made a... I could have just sat back down and fucking played the game.
[96:29.08]No.
[96:31.28]No, of course not.
[96:32.78]I just broke my fucking headphone.
[96:39.15]Just put it all down here.
[96:40.35]I don't have any paper towels down here.
[96:42.79]Fuck!
[96:44.89]This is actually bad.
[96:45.99]Let's close this.
[96:50.20]I'm not going to get paper towels.
[96:51.44]I have, like, a... There we go!
[96:53.72]Back here.
[96:54.10]I got paper towels back here.
[96:57.34]I know where these are from.
[96:59.65]When I made the Mega Man joke.
[97:01.35]Remember that?
[97:03.87]I stuffed a bunch of stuff around my hands, like Mega Man, and I said, Boom, boom!
[97:07.35]Mega Man costume!
[97:09.33]That paper towel's still here.
[97:15.62]Excellent.
[97:16.00]Alright, we're good.
[97:20.71]Back to it.
[97:22.40]Let's do the free-for-all.
[97:23.22]He's a little loyalty.
[97:23.96]He may do a little bit of foolery.
[97:26.94]I think he's still going to be fine.
[97:27.88]This is an F cup, whatever that means.
[97:30.32]That's worse than D. That's worse than E. Yeah, let's try it.
[97:43.65]Mega Man saves the day.
[97:52.82]The Freshman's Cup.
[97:58.72]Here we are.
[97:59.16]So this is a free-for-all.
[98:02.48]Is this a tournament?
[98:04.13]Or do you actually fight eight monsters at the same time?
[98:09.51]Sleep Bomb Palmer, Juno Mool, Nats, Stein, Leone, Winston, and... Cupella?
[98:22.16]What is that thing on the left?
[98:25.20]Wow, that thing was insane.
[98:27.46]There are so many different monster combinations in this.
[98:35.90]Oh, I love this.
[98:36.60]There's little whale people.
[98:38.04]I'm gonna be playing this for a while.
[98:40.64]Alright, Stein versus Leon.
[98:46.45]Let's take a look at some information on the opponent.
[98:49.85]Our opponent, Leon, has a high ski.
[98:52.43]Try to KO it before it gets our monster.
[98:55.21]Skill.
[98:56.81]Hit method.
[98:58.32]The distance between your monster and its opponent will decrease.
[99:01.14]Decide what attacks your monster can launch.
[99:03.44]Press X to give your monster a piece of advice.
[99:06.42]Use square, R1, and L1 on the controller to change attack advice.
[99:12.40]What?
[99:14.48]Well, how do you push away?
[99:18.27]Left and right directional.
[99:20.28]It won't like to go toward the walls or its opponent.
[99:23.24]If an opponent gets too close to your monster, you can order it to push its opponent back by pressing triangle.
[99:27.84]Okay, it was square in the first game.
[99:29.05]Alright.
[99:31.11]Just wanted to make sure I knew how to do that.
[99:34.03]Let's go!
[99:48.19]Alright, not bad.
[99:51.25]I... I have a little bit more skill.
[99:55.23]Not so much in the power department, but that's alright.
[100:00.59]Start with the flick.
[100:03.75]That's good, alright.
[100:07.48]That hurt a lot.
[100:08.78]Jesus.
[100:14.06]Shit.
[100:17.30]No, foolery!
[100:18.97]Oh boy, he is getting his ass kicked.
[100:28.59]Not good.
[100:33.23]He needs more moves, man.
[100:38.40]Nice, good dodge, good dodge, good dodge.
[100:44.64]Shit.
[100:48.82]Come on!
[100:49.90]Keep it up!
[100:52.22]Ah, god damn it.
[100:53.00]I don't think I'm gonna win this one.
[100:57.32]Yeah, he's just not doing enough damage.
[101:03.98]So if he needs more power, then... Why was his intelligence at 137 base and his power at like 90?
[101:18.14]You know what I mean?
[101:19.20]What's the point of him having such a high base intelligence?
[101:30.80]He needs to hit the gym.
[101:35.10]D-rank tournament.
[101:35.96]This is an F-rank tournament.
[101:41.56]He does get in moves.
[101:42.56]I'm just going to keep going with him with intelligence.
[101:47.34]We get another chance here.
[101:54.14]Leone is not moving forward.
[102:03.39]Oh, no, no, never mind.
[102:04.63]This is a free-for-all.
[102:11.35]Oh, this is both D and E. F is just for free-for-all.
[102:14.15]Okay.
[102:14.29]Okay.
[102:17.35]Yeah, I know I got all my moves are power moves right now, but maybe I should just keep training intelligence and just see what happens.
[102:32.08]Where's Edgehog when you need him?
[102:33.14]Oh, well.
[102:47.55]Oh, once we get our first intelligence move, we're gonna be hard to beat.
[102:55.94]Where's the meatloaf?
[102:58.14]Not here, apparently.
[103:02.38]We can bring out Banana Spit and see how much better he is.
[103:04.31]I don't know.
[103:05.69]No, I'm not gonna abandon Stein.
[103:08.29]Not yet.
[103:09.17]Maybe eventually here, but I want to get one intelligence move and see if it's worth it.
[103:14.41]Did a good job.
[103:15.95]They just told me I was way too hard on him, so we're not going to be angry with him.
[103:23.04]He's tired.
[103:23.66]Give him some rest.
[103:25.94]Then I'm going to train intelligence.
[103:27.42]Yeah, air entry time.
[103:43.33]I'm sure you're entering Stein, aren't you?
[103:46.99]What?
[103:47.59]The answer to the question is no.
[103:52.07]I'm not going to enter Stein.
[103:54.31]I don't... What are they trying to say here?
[104:05.08]No?
[104:05.36]No?
[104:06.46]Hmm.
[104:08.60]Well, I guess there's no rush.
[104:10.74]But you should reconsider.
[104:15.96]Wait, wait.
[104:28.57]We're talking about the tournament, guys.
[104:30.15]It's been a rough week.
[104:48.22]God fucking damn it.
[104:50.12]Errantry Intelligence.
[104:56.77]Intelligence.
[104:59.93]Let's see it.
[105:03.77]Do you want to send your monster to this Errantry?
[105:06.63]Yes.
[105:09.45]I don't care if I miss the... I'm not ready for it.
[105:17.11]First stage, Monkey Race.
[105:22.92]Or Crash Bandicoot 1.
[105:25.74]Yeah, beat you.
[105:28.50]Yep.
[105:29.32]You just got Mario Karted.
[105:30.54]This is what happens in Mario Kart.
[105:31.78]If you're playing as Bowser, just always be in front of somebody.
[105:34.73]It doesn't matter if they have a shell or whatever the fuck.
[105:36.51]They'll just consistently bump into your back.
[105:38.89]Just all... I lost.
[105:40.71]How?
[105:41.29]Okay, well let's do it again.
[105:47.11]I don't just fail every time.
[105:51.91]I just did the fuck you.
[105:53.09]Did you see that?
[105:53.67]I just put my... I did the fuck you.
[105:56.68]Forearm into forearm up in the air.
[106:03.82]Success.
[106:04.22]Okay, good.
[106:08.18]Not increasing by very much.
[106:11.70]Cliff leap.
[106:19.05]That's a big leap.
[106:20.87]I've played Dark Souls plenty of times where I know this is a bad idea.
[106:29.11]Oh, okay.
[106:29.69]You made it.
[106:30.01]Intelligence increased by five.
[106:34.47]There we go.
[106:37.95]Now, hopefully I got a new move.
[106:41.95]Rock Cavern.
[106:47.17]What's he need to do?
[106:52.56]That's happened to me in Dark Souls plenty of times too, you know, you fall down.
[107:02.77]Okay, he's dead.
[107:04.01]He's dead.
[107:06.31]Did he die?
[107:06.81]Okay, I was gonna say, holy shit, that's bad.
[107:09.67]I think he's still injured.
[107:13.15]It's a serious injury.
[107:14.49]What?
[107:14.85]I will put him in the hospital.
[107:16.23]No, wait, he actually is gonna die.
[107:21.03]Oh my god, Stine is still in the hospital!
[107:23.73]I wish it'll come back soon!
[107:24.95]Stine is still in the hospital!
[107:34.38]What?!
[107:37.00]He's still in the hospital!
[107:46.61]Hey!
[107:47.37]He's out of the hospital!
[107:48.57]There he is!
[107:51.99]Get back to work!
[107:53.23]Let's give him a little bit of rest.
[108:02.03]I- what did I do?
[108:02.85]I- I trained him intelligence.
[108:06.71]That was a- and now he's at loyalty 1, so he can't- no.
[108:11.62]Drills.
[108:13.46]So, okay, let me just take a look at something here.
[108:16.70]In the first game, when you did training, you got money.
[108:20.93]In this game, you don't get money by training.
[108:23.65]You can only get money from battles?
[108:25.53]Is that how this is working here?
[108:35.08]If he gets too smart, he's gonna run away.
[108:43.48]You only get money from tournaments.
[108:46.05]You can actually sell items, too.
[108:50.94]Okay.
[108:53.70]Air entry is the training that you pay for.
[108:57.81]But selling monsters, you actually get money this time.
[109:00.45]Because it used to be you just gave it to them for free.
[109:04.59]Have some more milk.
[109:05.85]Yeah, I'm going to save it right now.
[109:20.54]Official tournament.
[109:21.30]You have to prepare your stein.
[109:25.40]Visitor, you have mail.
[109:27.04]Thank you.
[109:29.51]Look at this.
[109:29.91]It's official king seal.
[109:38.51]Amarantry is usually expensive.
[109:40.52]Shall we send stein?
[109:41.70]This month?
[109:43.22]Price reduction.
[109:43.86]Good.
[109:44.32]I don't... I don't have any money.
[109:49.02]As used to...
[109:55.74]More intelligence.
[110:01.98]We can skip these, but something about them makes me not want to.
[110:10.23]Give me a new move, please.
[110:16.61]Give me an intelligence move.
[110:18.97]Rip those unicorns off your head.
[110:20.79]And have laser beams come out.
[110:32.96]More crash music.
[110:34.60]Yeah.
[110:40.22]Great!
[110:41.43]Ooh!
[110:43.31]So, there's different... This rolls.
[110:45.59]It seems that he did his best.
[110:47.69]Yes, praise him.
[110:50.27]So, this rolls inside of the roll.
[110:52.13]So, it used to be you just roll to actually complete the task.
[110:56.00]Now you roll to complete the task, and then you roll if it's a good job or not.
[111:02.36]Do it again.
[111:06.07]I need to get an intelligence move.
[111:14.66]Great, again.
[111:15.76]See that little sprinkle?
[111:17.26]Oh.
[111:19.38]Increase by six.
[111:25.41]It's raining.
[111:25.93]Hey, this is the official tournament.
[111:28.41]Doesn't seem in good shape.
[111:29.75]Don't get KO'd in the game.
[111:40.30]You can only get moves from Errantry.
[111:44.58]Is that different from the first game?
[111:50.87]Yeah, okay, so you have to do Errantry to get a new move.
[111:53.25]Because before, if you leveled up just by doing the regular work, you could... Okay.
[112:00.27]Alright, so we have to... Oh no, that means we need money.
[112:05.30]Should I go sell somebody?
[112:15.46]No, just slaughter him.
[112:17.02]No.
[112:17.14]What?
[112:19.32]I... No.
[112:23.97]Level up power.
[112:24.65]Okay, we're gonna level up power until we have enough power to be able to power through the next tournament.
[112:36.89]What was that?
[112:40.35]What was that move?
[112:44.80]Leveled up power, good.
[112:51.34]Sell this pink blob of shit.
[112:55.42]What you meant to say is a hairless Furby.
[113:01.17]Bald Furby.
[113:04.99]Draw them in the bathtub, you guys are fucking relentless.
[113:15.61]Alright, that's good.
[113:17.31]106.
[113:22.45]There's skill chains.
[113:23.60]Like, the moves you learn are based on the basic moves bet.
[113:25.76]You spam.
[113:26.66]Really.
[113:28.56]Interesting.
[113:29.30]His loyalty is still terrible.
[113:30.72]Do it again.
[113:48.37]Stupid!
[113:55.34]Love and respect him.
[113:57.84]Let's let him... Let's rest.
[114:00.18]Save game.
[114:03.46]Download it.
[114:10.59]Sell off his scraps of meat.
[114:14.89]No.
[114:15.73]No, don't give him fish.
[114:16.67]That's too expensive.
[114:19.54]Milk only.
[114:20.54]A diet of milk.
[114:26.62]Here, eat well.
[114:27.38]Uh-oh, I think I lost connection to chat.
[114:31.09]Yeah, I did.
[114:31.45]There we go, hold on.
[114:38.21]Hey, now I can see you.
[114:44.43]This is the game where you put CDs into a PS1 and catch random Pokémon.
[114:47.37]That is correct.
[114:48.89]This is Monster Rancher.
[114:51.39]Alright, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[115:12.89]And then call it a day.
[115:15.25]I still got a few CDs to put in.
[115:17.87]Alright, what do we got?
[115:20.69]This is a D tournament.
[115:21.51]We need the E tournament.
[115:23.35]Because we suck.
[115:24.90]So that's tomorrow.
[115:26.32]Okay, go to bed for a week.
[115:28.68]And then wake up.
[115:30.28]Get some chips.
[115:32.00]800 bucks.
[115:32.82]We can do that one.
[115:34.20]Rest.
[115:36.74]Rest up for it.
[115:47.18]Let's try the battle.
[115:49.62]It's a bunch of shitties.
[115:53.68]We need the money.
[116:03.32]Use the fucking eyeball.
[116:04.52]No, but the eyeball, that's cheating.
[116:06.47]He has 999 in a couple of stats.
[116:12.43]Yeah, we're in the maple syrup.
[116:14.71]The maple cup.
[116:17.66]Freezing rain is pouring down here in the Papas arena.
[116:20.12]Maple Cup is now beginning.
[116:22.22]Let's go for it.
[116:24.42]Show me all the other monsters that are not even worth putting in.
[116:28.23]Why is he here?
[116:31.19]Dude, you got to move on from the Maple Cup.
[116:33.69]It's not fair.
[116:36.21]He lost.
[116:39.16]He just lost to the Pokémon that was taking a bunch of drugs.
[116:42.14]What was that?
[116:42.82]That was like Dr. Mario pills.
[116:46.87]Harry kicks.
[116:51.17]Okay, let's get some info on him.
[116:55.10]Our opponent, Lontar, has high intelligence, so be aware of the distance between our monster and it at all times.
[117:03.18]Let's fucking go.
[117:09.62]So in the last game, L1 and R1 moved around.
[117:12.30]This time it's the D-pad.
[117:16.44]Now it's L1 and R1 goes from skill to skill?
[117:22.09]Fuck man, this is gonna be difficult.
[117:24.23]My defense is terrible.
[117:30.95]Good thing he had the problem too.
[117:32.51]Oh my god, really?
[117:33.62]94% and he's fooling around!
[117:50.47]Man you suck Five damage five five Back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up.
[118:14.17]Oh, come on.
[118:14.99]Stop being confused.
[118:16.09]Oh
[118:19.35]That's what I'm talking about.
[118:20.05]Do it again.
[118:22.49]Do it again, quick.
[118:23.57]Again, quick, quick, quick.
[118:25.31]Get the percentage.
[118:28.26]Right at the buzzer.
[118:37.71]Fuck.
[118:50.21]Why was I supposed to assume that a guy... When he came out of the fucking oven, right?
[118:56.35]When we first made this guy.
[118:58.07]He had 137 intelligence and, like, 90 power.
[119:02.83]Shouldn't I assume that that's an int-based monster?
[119:06.58]You know what I'm saying?
[119:13.76]Like, when he came out...
[119:27.16]We're gonna lose to this dude.
[119:34.24]Maybe not, depends.
[119:37.11]Just double tap it.
[119:38.47]Nope, he dodged it.
[119:42.01]This is the best move we have.
[119:50.22]Come on, just let me win like one match.
[119:57.54]Dude, I'm losing a lot of these rolls here.
[120:03.54]Why has he not done anything?
[120:11.83]No!
[120:13.47]Ah!
[120:14.07]One hit!
[120:14.69]My fucking defense is so terrible.
[120:21.86]You know, I kind of hope he dies.
[120:23.06]Wow.
[120:35.09]God fucking dammit.
[120:51.26]This guy baked out with fucking bad stats.
[120:57.50]I'm trying to dump intelligence to try to learn a new intelligence move.
[121:03.59]And it's not gonna happen.
[121:06.62]This dude needs an int move or he's useless.
[121:21.23]He's still a baby.
[121:24.96]Back into the oven.
[121:26.14]No, no, just... How am I gonna... Yeah, he's going back.
[121:30.50]He's going back in the freezer.
[121:32.26]We're gonna pull a fucking... We're gonna pull, like, the... plant monkey.
[121:36.25]I just have no money.
[121:46.51]This sucks.
[121:52.69]Yeah, sorry.
[121:55.07]Sorry, Stein.
[121:56.08]You're going back into the freezer.
[122:00.14]We're bringing out banana spit.
[122:08.78]Let's save it right here just in case something crazy happens.
[122:21.75]My god.
[122:24.03]Alright, put him in the lab.
[122:26.06]Freeze him.
[122:31.90]Banana Spit's gonna come out.
[122:33.48]You know, it's always the second or third monster that's always the one you use.
[122:36.00]Let's revive.
[122:40.27]Let me just take a look here.
[122:41.25]Okay, we've got Tropical Ape, Banana Spit.
[122:50.64]Look, the defense is great.
[122:51.56]Look, this is what I'm talking about.
[122:52.67]This is balanced.
[122:56.23]Look at these good balanced base stats.
[123:02.79]No money, but it's alright.
[123:03.87]I can win a tournament with these stats.
[123:11.22]Yeah.
[123:12.08]We need to win some money.
[123:13.64]I'll come back and make some more monsters in like 30-40 minutes.
[123:17.44]We have to win a tournament with this guy.
[123:24.47]What did I do to Butterlust?
[123:25.55]Butterlust unfortunately got deleted.
[123:31.11]Bring him to the ranch.
[123:41.69]His stats are just a bunch of... I mean, he doesn't have higher skill, but it doesn't really matter.
[123:45.09]Everything else that Stein had was terrible.
[123:51.43]There he is.
[123:51.77]And look at how much cooler he is.
[123:54.96]He's wiping his ass on the carpet.
[123:56.26]He's great.
[123:57.11]I already love him.
[123:58.45]So what do we want to train here?
[123:59.33]Uh, I would say pow- He's got really good defense.
[124:04.69]Power and skill.
[124:06.15]Probably, I would say.
[124:06.81]Let's take a look.
[124:10.75]He likes tablets.
[124:13.16]He doesn't like to battle.
[124:16.86]Well, you- That makes you pretty useless.
[124:22.68]You dislike the thing that this game is all about.
[124:26.88]He likes to sit on his iPad and fuckin' watch... TV.
[124:31.86]And he doesn't like to fight anything.
[124:37.47]Alright, well he's got slap and thwack.
[124:42.73]Good hit percentage is really good, uh, power... cost here, that's good.
[124:49.71]Okay.
[124:50.53]Let's train some power.
[124:54.16]He just takes a shit, wipes his ass, and plays Clash of Clans on his iPad.
[125:01.89]Sits in his pot because he's a fucking plant.
[125:03.73]Alright, power.
[125:06.01]Then let's begin.
[125:07.21]Wait, what is meditate?
[125:08.43]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[125:09.93]Which one is selected?
[125:10.77]I can't even tell.
[125:11.39]What can we do here?
[125:15.88]We want power and... What about power and skill?
[125:21.11]Power and skill.
[125:23.23]Is there a power and skill?
[125:25.81]Of course not.
[125:26.85]Let's just do domino.
[125:35.29]Nice.
[125:42.16]No, don't scold him right off the bat.
[125:47.10]Turn him into a killing machine.
[125:52.63]Why- why did I have that in- why did I have 0, 0, 0, 0?
[125:56.03]Oh fuck, I know he wants tablets.
[126:00.69]Of course you want the most expensive fucking thing.
[126:05.76]Let's give him what he wants.
[126:17.26]He eats only the most expensive foods.
[126:22.04]Official tournament at the end of the month.
[126:29.92]Make some bucks.
[126:30.82]Yes.
[126:34.45]There actually is a banana behind him.
[126:39.19]That makes his name that much better.
[126:43.29]Okay.
[126:46.09]Is the banana alive?
[126:47.77]Or is that a... It has to be alive, right?
[126:50.09]Like stickly?
[126:54.67]Whatever.
[126:54.91]Does it have eyes?
[126:55.51]It's all good.
[126:58.47]Do the dominoes again.
[126:59.20]Come on.
[127:06.06]Nice.
[127:08.58]Success.
[127:10.36]Plus one power.
[127:12.72]Holy shit, man.
[127:13.32]That's awful.
[127:19.26]When is the tournament?
[127:23.35]Round Robin, sixth entrance, official cup E. So we got one more day of work and then a day of rest.
[127:30.17]Let's get that power up.
[127:39.55]One, two, three.
[127:46.07]No, we can't, we can't scold him.
[127:52.37]He still seems well.
[127:55.39]Do it again.
[127:55.83]Where's the skill?
[128:01.44]Shoot?
[128:02.72]Okay.
[128:03.74]What the hell is this?
[128:11.35]Did he not do it?
[128:12.21]Is that a failure?
[128:13.93]That's not a failure, right?
[128:14.91]He got two out of three.
[128:16.05]Oh my god.
[128:18.75]Now you get scolded.
[128:25.83]Hey, this week's the official tournament.
[128:26.96]Banana Split doesn't seem in good shape.
[128:28.68]Don't get KO'd in the game.
[128:31.18]You've run out of money.
[128:32.14]You better enter Banana Split and do a tournament.
[128:33.84]Yes.
[128:35.06]He seems tired.
[128:37.36]Too bad.
[128:38.97]Go win some money.
[128:42.31]Your stats are good.
[128:43.75]You're not going to get KO'd.
[128:45.27]You have 160 defense almost.
[128:45.87]You're going to be fine.
[128:56.11]No, we can't let... We need money.
[129:00.89]Everything is on his shoulders.
[129:01.89]Yes, it is.
[129:02.47]Time to start the tournament.
[129:09.14]I feel a bit nervous, but let's go for victory.
[129:14.06]He's tired and doesn't like to fight.
[129:16.04]Yes, I know.
[129:17.12]But it's okay.
[129:19.25]Because he has higher stats than probably everybody here.
[129:28.21]Just use the god monster.
[129:29.27]But that's... I don't want to cheat.
[129:30.83]I want to do this the right way.
[129:35.97]Fuck, his stats really aren't that much better.
[129:38.01]They are.
[129:38.33]His defense is so good.
[129:39.43]Alright, let's get in there.
[129:43.20]Let's see how he is.
[129:43.94]Let's try Thwack.
[129:49.90]That's really slow.
[129:50.88]Oh god.
[129:59.14]I like that move, he squishes you like a fucking soda can.
[130:04.24]Wow, what?
[130:05.42]What is with the- I thought he had high defense!
[130:07.76]Oh my god, what the fuck is happening?
[130:10.64]Stop it!
[130:12.52]What?
[130:16.36]Back it up.
[130:20.68]Oh my fucking god.
[130:36.37]I need to just do that, like, one more time.
[130:38.03]I lost.
[130:41.33]That's it.
[130:42.09]I lost.
[130:43.67]I got fucking licked three times in a row and it killed me.
[130:57.48]I can't... Oh my god, like, give me a break.
[131:05.35]I got Triple Lick Stunlocked and I lost.
[131:07.59]I have to win a couple of rounds here.
[131:21.15]Let's go.
[131:33.21]His stats aren't even that, like, much better.
[131:35.71]His defense is so bad.
[131:36.65]Like, I have to win this.
[131:39.14]I mean, he might dodge everything I do, though.
[131:41.10]That's the... God, whatever.
[131:42.44]Just stay back.
[131:46.06]I can't do anything if you're this far back.
[131:47.78]Let's build up some... 50%.
[131:55.97]Let him waste his shit.
[131:57.51]Back it up.
[131:59.11]Oh my god.
[132:05.39]Now back up.
[132:06.53]That was a big hit.
[132:07.81]Back it up.
[132:11.24]We both have to be close, but I want to be able to make sure I can hit him.
[132:15.44]Finally.
[132:16.70]I'm getting actual good rolls here.
[132:19.28]Over 50% and they're actually hitting.
[132:22.08]Lookit.
[132:23.35]Do you see how screwed I've been getting from RNG this entire time?
[132:29.03]We're talking 60 plus percent and I haven't hit anything.
[132:33.65]There.
[132:33.99]There's a win.
[132:34.93]Finally.
[132:35.29]Jesus Christ.
[132:42.74]He's at one... Yeah, he's good.
[132:44.04]We're good.
[132:44.82]He's good.
[132:49.37]We're fine.
[132:55.25]Finally a win.
[132:56.85]We actually might be able to win the tournament, too.
[133:00.46]It's very possible.
[133:04.15]I won.
[133:05.67]Oh, no.
[133:06.09]That's not the tournament.
[133:07.17]They start talking about that.
[133:08.13]I'm like, yeah, I did it.
[133:10.31]I win.
[133:13.65]I am concerned about the pancake batter.
[133:15.77]I feel like that guy's going to be tough.
[133:18.28]Yeah.
[133:24.10]Now, Lone Tar.
[133:25.06]We're going to have to maybe fight Lone Tar again.
[133:27.50]Alright.
[133:29.66]We're going against Gnats.
[133:31.30]It's a bunny, so safety.
[133:35.07]High speed, so use the techniques with high hit rate, yep.
[133:37.63]Alright, let's do it.
[133:48.92]Don't let the Oakley man get too far.
[133:53.11]He's got really good power though.
[133:54.63]His defense is awful.
[133:55.77]We gotta land like two hits and he's gonna die.
[134:00.62]I have the highest hit percentage of the thwack.
[134:04.04]Let's just get in close and just start hammering him.
[134:09.98]He's gonna dodge, though.
[134:10.98]I'm gonna wait for a good percentage.
[134:13.72]I have to.
[134:14.06]His dodge is too good.
[134:15.73]Okay, I don't know what the hell he just did.
[134:19.87]Okay, that's actually called gas.
[134:20.99]He's literally farting in my face.
[134:22.75]Over and over again.
[134:24.27]And it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal.
[134:25.97]I can handle it.
[134:30.34]Okay, well I have to hit him with a move.
[134:33.42]Like, like now.
[134:34.48]Because it's not doing... If I don't touch him once... Oh no, he's gonna win.
[134:41.64]Just simply by doing that move.
[134:45.49]There it is.
[134:46.59]75%.
[134:47.43]What the flying fuck?
[134:49.29]Come on!
[134:52.05]He's gonna win!
[134:53.79]Oh, come... One hit!
[134:55.37]Hit him, please!
[134:58.20]Oh...
[134:59.89]Get in there and hit him!
[135:03.59]67!
[135:03.75]Oh, thank God!
[135:05.90]It wasn't enough.
[135:11.32]Yes, it was.
[135:11.88]Thank Jesus.
[135:13.42]What the f- Give me a break.
[135:20.02]Why is he doing that?
[135:24.91]Ugh.
[135:28.53]That was a good strat.
[135:29.89]Just do the face fart like 20 times and try to make it so I can't hit him.
[135:37.74]Alright, so I'm 2-1.
[135:40.68]Pancake Batter wins again.
[135:42.94]Pancake Batter's 2-1.
[135:44.54]Here comes the Tournament Championship.
[135:53.59]Okay, bring it on here.
[135:56.67]This guy is 0 for 3.
[135:59.33]So, I... It would be really embarrassing if I lost.
[136:04.26]He's got high skill.
[136:05.30]Try to KO it before it gets... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[136:09.52]This is like the shitty singing penguin.
[136:13.98]From Mario 64.
[136:16.02]That's what it looks like.
[136:16.58]It looks like the dumb penguin mother that goes like... With the slide level.
[136:21.52]The one you can jump off the edge and you can skip it and you get the star.
[136:26.17]But he's cool looking.
[136:30.03]Why did he lose so much?
[136:31.07]He's fucking awesome.
[136:35.13]He has more balance, better stats than everybody in the whole tournament.
[136:38.43]He's going to beat me.
[136:44.68]Don't ask me how the fuck he lost.
[136:45.88]Maybe he has a terrible loyalty or something.
[136:48.44]That's weird.
[136:49.36]Okay.
[136:49.50]Okay.
[136:59.19]Come on.
[136:59.43]Give me... Dodge it.
[137:02.47]It's alright.
[137:02.77]I got good defense.
[137:03.42]There you go.
[137:08.54]Come on.
[137:08.72]Double up.
[137:09.60]That was a good hit though.
[137:11.74]Back it up.
[137:12.16]Back it up.
[137:12.56]Back it up.
[137:12.94]Back it up.
[137:14.54]He's got way higher guts than I do.
[137:16.56]Let's wait for him to make a mistake.
[137:22.85]Dodge it.
[137:24.25]Fuck.
[137:25.15]That was not good.
[137:27.49]Come on here.
[137:30.01]Like, can I get a goddamn turn?
[137:39.14]Every time, man, it's just the full of the confusion thing.
[137:41.88]Come on.
[137:42.70]Fucking just do a move.
[137:44.98]Oh my god, that's three, that's four in a row.
[137:46.82]That's four confusions in a row.
[137:48.70]Five confusions in a row.
[137:50.76]Five fucking confusions in a row.
[137:53.97]Holy shit, why do you suck so much?
[138:06.15]Loyalty's just too low.
[138:19.04]We still haven't fought the Pancake Batter Monster.
[138:20.84]There's still an opportunity to win, you know?
[138:30.45]I need to win three?
[138:31.31]He needs to lose one.
[138:35.02]Here we go.
[138:35.38]So he's three and one.
[138:36.28]I'm two and two.
[138:36.96]I have to win this.
[138:40.90]What the hell does this guy even do?
[138:44.30]He's got high life, so hit it with strong attacks.
[138:47.06]Okay.
[138:48.06]It's his defense, then.
[138:54.00]I gave him too much milk?
[138:57.10]No, this guy's gotten a steady diet of tablets.
[139:00.22]He got the highest concentration of nutrients.
[139:05.30]Okay, his defense is terrible.
[139:07.38]He's got terrible skill.
[139:09.01]His speed is good, though.
[139:10.89]Okay.
[139:13.71]Let's try to whack him.
[139:14.51]78.
[139:20.94]There it is.
[139:21.78]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[139:27.26]Why?
[139:28.04]With such a... You gotta be fucking kidding me with a 40% hit chance for him.
[139:33.02]And I can't even hit him with 78%.
[139:37.76]Is this game lying to me or am I just getting absolutely decimated?
[139:41.77]And he's confused.
[139:42.75]60%.
[139:47.29]I can hit him with 60 but not fucking 80.
[139:52.17]I have to just try to wrap it up here.
[139:53.79]No.
[140:00.67]Ayayay.
[140:01.25]If I can hit him one more time here... No.
[140:08.23]I gotta crit him.
[140:12.41]No.
[140:12.67]Yeah, it's a 78% chance to miss.
[140:14.03]It's a good thing I dodged that, because he may have died.
[140:21.41]Yeah, what's with the percentage for the enemy?
[140:22.79]40%?
[140:22.81]30%?
[140:22.89]They hit it every single time!
[140:23.69]I have over 70 and I can't hit it?
[140:39.57]My monster hates to fight.
[140:40.89]That's so stupid.
[140:52.13]I'm calling bullshit on those numbers.
[140:53.59]I mean, we've very clearly seen me miss.
[140:57.69]At an over 60% hit rate.
[140:59.25]Sometimes over 70%.
[141:00.29]And I miss like three times in a row.
[141:03.69]That's like... What is that?
[141:07.08]Did I make any money?
[141:11.02]I made a hundred bucks.
[141:11.85]Now that's just enough money to turn this guy into fucking pig food.
[141:20.89]No new fans.
[141:30.58]That's just enough for me to throw this guy into the blender with some garlic and thyme.
[141:33.96]And then spread him over some bread and eat him, make a sandwich.
[141:43.36]He's learned a lesson in this tournament.
[141:45.46]See, look.
[141:53.70]Hey, he learned some things!
[141:57.70]Why did I buy those tablets?
[141:58.86]Because it's his favorite food and I was trying to be a good dad.
[142:04.33]Don't have enough money for tablets, you're gonna have to eat fucking potatoes, dude.
[142:10.39]Drink some milk.
[142:14.98]Have you tried combining?
[142:16.06]We have not combined anything yet.
[142:24.37]Oh, Banana Split seems very tired.
[142:27.45]Yes he does.
[142:30.61]Go to bed.
[142:34.78]Maybe I should make another monster.
[142:37.66]Should I put in like 3D Movie Maker again and see what we get from this game?
[142:42.63]Let's just see, because I'm not happy with these monsters.
[142:45.79]I'm just not.
[142:46.29]I don't know.
[142:48.49]I'm okay with banana spit.
[142:50.19]I am, but... We've got a couple more SEGA CD games to put in here.
[142:57.85]Let's give them a try.
[143:08.57]Yeah, I'm not against using him because his stats are good and we just have to get the loyalty up and his hit percentage and chance and all that out, but... Let's see if we can get something else here.
[143:20.16]We need more options.
[143:25.36]So... Let's go back here.
[143:30.41]Go to the shrine.
[143:31.41]What do we got?
[143:33.59]We have... That's empty.
[143:36.07]Alright, we have Surgical Strike.
[143:39.17]Here it is, if you want to see it.
[143:40.79]Here you go.
[143:44.95]SEGA CD.
[143:48.03]Surgical Strike.
[143:49.79]Somebody said the facecam was too small.
[143:51.28]How about that?
[143:52.08]That's nice and big now, ain't it?
[143:53.36]This is going in.
[143:57.34]Let's see what we can do.
[143:58.38]You've got to be careful, though.
[144:08.61]I'm surrounded by discs.
[144:11.31]They're everywhere.
[144:13.90]That's not what I wanted to do.
[144:14.76]Alright, something good.
[144:25.53]Nice Keanu Reeves haircut.
[144:26.77]I know, it sucks.
[144:29.03]I didn't choose this haircut.
[144:36.28]Is freezing the euphemism for killing them?
[144:37.93]No.
[144:38.81]Freezing, you just actually put them essentially on a shelf.
[144:44.19]You can also combine freezed, freezed, idiot, frozen monsters into a new monster entirely, and we'll be doing that at some point in the game as well.
[144:59.98]Let's see what we got, come on.
[145:01.80]Something interesting, something that I regret to tell you that... This rare monster can be reproduced only by an authorized trainer.
[145:07.43]Where's the... Where's WWF The Music Volume 3?
[145:14.73]That's where we're keeping all the good monsters.
[145:17.87]Why do I have to do that?
[145:19.69]Where's the WWF The Music Volume 3 case?
[145:35.87]I have no idea.
[145:41.06]I don't know where it is.
[145:41.92]Is that it down there?
[145:45.98]There we go.
[145:46.72]Let's put that in the box.
[145:55.05]Surgical strike.
[145:59.71]Turn the music off?
[146:00.68]I don't think you can.
[146:03.41]I don't think the music is able to be turned off.
[146:05.15]Alright, now we're going to put in... I don't even know.
[146:10.16]I tried to install this game a long time ago.
[146:13.96]This is Lands of Lore 3.
[146:18.18]It's an old shitty PC game and there's like five discs.
[146:21.23]We're going to try all four discs of Lands of Lore 3.
[146:25.07]Sounds like a plan.
[146:26.17]Let's do it.
[146:36.08]Yeah, land lore.
[146:37.60]Uh-huh.
[146:42.98]We'll just go with disk two, because disk two is blue.
[146:45.01]There you go.
[146:46.91]There it is.
[146:49.83]Has anybody ever even heard of this game?
[146:52.93]Because when I was on like a binge of trying to find old PC games that looked interesting, this was one of them, and then I couldn't get it to work.
[147:00.74]Well, one of them just fell, and that's fine.
[147:01.96]We don't even need it.
[147:06.80]No.
[147:07.32]No, no one's ever heard of it before.
[147:09.78]Doesn't surprise me at all.
[147:18.69]Okay.
[147:20.59]In goes Monster Ranch 2.
[147:21.81]Give me something cool.
[147:26.03]Something worth investing in!
[147:33.08]Finally, here's the big moment.
[147:34.24]I can actually get a monster out of this.
[147:37.33]None of this.
[147:38.05]You can't do that.
[147:39.25]It's too rare.
[147:48.82]What is that?
[147:49.20]You can already see it.
[147:49.80]No, you can't.
[147:50.20]What is it?
[147:50.54]It's another wall.
[148:05.96]Okay.
[148:07.99]This is not Sweet Rind, this is just The Rind.
[148:19.82]That speed is so bad.
[148:26.39]Defensive power okay, but man, that speed.
[148:29.33]It's just truly terrible.
[148:35.76]This life is bad.
[148:37.74]Let's take it.
[148:38.60]I'm going to take it.
[148:39.18]I'm just going to call it the rind.
[148:42.29]Because this is obviously not sweet rind.
[148:50.37]This is just the rind part.
[148:54.66]There's no sweetness here.
[148:56.78]It's just the gross outside unedible piece.
[149:08.51]Freeze him because I want to do a couple more CDs in here.
[149:15.20]I might just combine him.
[149:16.20]Maybe we'll do some combinations here after another couple CDs.
[149:22.62]Freeze him.
[149:24.68]Now let's put in Lands of Lore, disk 4.
[149:29.88]Save the game.
[149:30.58]That's a good idea.
[149:32.52]I agree.
[149:36.02]Save data.
[149:40.94]We're just only gonna use lands of lore from here on out.
[149:46.09]I already got it saved, alright.
[149:52.15]Westwood Studios made this.
[149:53.49]They're the guys that made, um... Command & Conquer.
[149:58.31]Really?
[149:58.81]Is this game any good?
[150:00.99]I really should try to get this to work.
[150:03.36]Okay, let's put it in.
[150:07.51]Again, total transparency.
[150:09.41]Total transparency.
[150:10.37]There it is.
[150:10.85]Lands of Lore, disk number four.
[150:13.73]Just in case you guys think I'm putting in, like, Bubsy.
[150:17.10]Remember that funny game?
[150:17.92]Uh-oh.
[150:20.82]Uh-oh.
[150:22.94]Oh, shit.
[150:23.64]This is actually really bad.
[150:32.23]The CD tray may never close again.
[150:38.70]Fuck.
[150:46.05]Fuck.
[150:49.17]No.
[151:27.13]Hold on.
[151:28.65]That doesn't reset, right?
[151:32.95]This is like fucking broken.
[151:34.43]How?
[151:34.71]I don't even touch that button.
[151:39.83]Come on.
[151:40.15]Got it?
[151:50.84]Yes!
[151:54.20]I'm sorry.
[152:07.72]I'm sorry.
[152:08.78]Wait, didn't I say I was never going to scream ever again?
[152:10.68]This is Resident Evil 2.
[152:15.62]Where's Monster Rancher?
[152:18.06]This is Monster Rancher 1.
[152:19.78]Where is Monster Rancher?
[152:21.43]This was like 50 bucks.
[152:23.11]Don't fucking do that.
[152:25.05]Put it away.
[152:26.41]This was like 50 fucking dollars.
[152:28.53]Oh my god, why would you do that?
[152:30.75]What an idiot.
[152:31.97]Put it away.
[152:37.32]No, this is Fighter Maker.
[152:38.88]Where is it?
[152:43.40]You have no idea what this fucking desk looks like.
[152:51.65]Oh, no.
[152:52.03]Where the fuck is it?
[152:52.71]Seriously.
[152:56.08]Got it.
[153:01.91]Somebody said, please stop screaming.
[153:03.43]I don't even mean to.
[153:04.45]I'm sorry, dude.
[153:05.85]I really, like, I just thought it would be funny.
[153:08.83]It's not.
[153:09.43]It never is.
[153:14.80]Big moment.
[153:15.24]Come on.
[153:15.62]Something good.
[153:20.36]First time here, I'm leaving because he's a scream streamer.
[153:22.92]Fuck.
[153:24.05]I almost just screamed again.
[153:27.25]Come on.
[153:27.51]Suck up that DNA.
[153:28.65]Suck up that fucking DNA.
[153:35.82]I mean, it is Lands of Lord, disk 4.
[154:00.57]Lands of Lord!
[154:13.22]Here it is.
[154:14.84]Lands of Lore Disk 3.
[154:18.22]Full transparency.
[154:19.22]No, full transparency.
[154:20.28]Sponsored.
[154:20.78]I could spin it on my hand like that.
[154:39.88]See, it's spinning.
[154:43.23]If this is another wall, then I'm not gonna put the other disk in.
[154:49.07]I think the stats were exactly the same.
[154:51.69]I think at least.
[154:52.17]40-year-old streamer sponsored by 40-year-old game.
[154:56.39]40-year-old game.
[155:02.70]This game's not even fucking 25 years old.
[155:05.58]Is it?
[155:08.50]Yeah.
[155:11.20]It has the date right here.
[155:12.08]It's, um...
[155:15.38]2235.
[155:18.80]Jesus Christ, this has their whole... This has all their information on it.
[155:25.75]That's kind of fucking... Well, I mean, now it's not good.
[155:29.81]This has the company's address and phone number on it.
[155:40.07]Back in the day, they used to do that.
[155:42.34]You can't really do that shit anymore.
[155:49.54]Call it.
[155:50.08]I'm not going to call the number.
[155:51.62]It's not going to be in service.
[155:52.70]Or it's going to be a complete, it's going to be some like family's number that has nothing to do with this.
[155:59.07]That they just got a phone number like 20 fucking years ago when this company went under.
[156:03.92]Here we go.
[156:07.20]Big moment.
[156:18.21]It's the same, it's the same thing.
[156:19.80]It's... It's not... The lands of lore is only walls, because it's... Probably the same fucking data on every disk.
[156:28.16]No, leave him behind.
[156:29.62]What a waste of time.
[156:38.09]What else we got?
[156:42.40]These are all PlayStation 3.
[156:44.90]Oh, we have this game that I wasn't able to play because it came in late.
[156:47.50]It's another light gun game.
[156:49.51]This is called Gunfighter, The Legend of Jesse James.
[156:54.95]There.
[156:57.31]You know, total transparency!
[156:59.95]No, you didn't get to see it.
[157:00.76]That could have been anything.
[157:01.56]This could have been fucking Frogger and you would not even know.
[157:04.64]You got your address on there, Ubisoft?
[157:08.60]Nah, they were smart enough to leave it off.
[157:12.34]Okay, let's go.
[157:17.50]Gunfighter, Legend of Jesse James.
[157:18.90]If you're wondering why we didn't play this when we did the light gun stuff, it's because it didn't come in.
[157:27.15]It came in late.
[157:27.83]It came in like three days after I did all those light gun streams.
[157:39.25]I feel like we're getting some pretty bogus monsters.
[157:43.16]So far in Monster Rancher 2.
[157:51.73]Late game.
[157:52.23]What do you mean late game?
[157:54.27]No, come on.
[157:55.13]It's another rare monster.
[157:56.23]I have to... This is such bullshit.
[158:02.18]I don't want to like keep a stack of these CDs.
[158:04.10]Just give me the monster for Christ's sake.
[158:10.23]It's like half of these I can't even use.
[158:12.53]Now what?
[158:19.71]What is this?
[158:21.47]Alright, what's this one?
[158:28.09]This is... Okay, this is C&C Music Factory for SEGA CD.
[158:32.60]There you go.
[158:37.55]There it is.
[158:38.53]I want a disk slate.
[158:44.42]Honestly, whatever it is, we're going to combine this with the wall.
[158:48.62]I don't care what it is.
[158:52.10]This could be anything and I'm going to try to combine it with the wall.
[159:01.77]Why SEGA CD?
[159:02.43]Because SEGA CD discs are actually CDs.
[159:05.19]Most things I have are DVDs.
[159:09.04]Once we move on to Monster Rancher 3, I will have a ton of DVDs.
[159:13.66]I got Dino Crisis right here, too.
[159:14.90]We can put that in.
[159:23.22]Alright.
[159:26.04]Get a double wall?
[159:28.26]Nah.
[159:34.02]What is this?
[159:36.60]I was looking at this and I was curious, why, why, what is this?
[159:40.83]Why do I have this on my desk?
[159:45.47]I don't know.
[159:45.75]It was just there.
[159:47.07]Alright, something cool so we can at least play with it or combine it.
[159:52.19]No more fucking around, let's- I might even take the monkey back.
[160:02.74]Okay.
[160:07.61]It's like... What is this?
[160:12.84]Cute.
[160:14.04]Yes, it's a very cute monster.
[160:23.35]166 intelligence, 148 defense.
[160:26.11]I... Yeah.
[160:30.95]Okay, what do you think?
[160:31.62]It looks like it's a human.
[160:33.58]It's like maybe like an elf.
[160:39.10]Make a girl wall combined with the wall Want me to make a girl a girl wall?
[160:50.39]I'm gonna give it like something like a like how about like, um, like a cool like enchanted name.
[160:55.13]How about uh Like equestria, right?
[160:59.00]That's like an enchanted name, right?
[161:02.90]Why did I just say that why did I just pull out like a fucking stupid reference that everybody knows
[161:11.62]Why did I just say that?
[161:12.66]That was a mistake.
[161:22.35]Uh, how about... Wow, Widowmaker!
[161:24.79]I'm not gonna be Widowmaker, please.
[161:28.93]How about... No, it's not gonna be like Waifu, please, guys.
[161:36.51]Let's get a little bit of creativity here, you know what I mean?
[161:40.87]A little bit of creativity.
[161:42.57]Alright, save.
[162:13.24]Lara Croft.
[162:14.50]No.
[162:15.32]That's a... It's just... Yeah, good creativity.
[162:18.41]Alright, let's go.
[162:22.55]And hey, oh, what's that?
[162:23.51]We're gonna combine her with the wall.
[162:28.03]Free.
[162:29.09]Hey!
[162:29.91]You can't, as long as you have one.
[162:31.50]Freeze, combine, Lara wall.
[162:33.58]Let's see what we get.
[162:40.12]Mm-hmm.
[162:41.68]It's gonna be interesting.
[162:43.36]Oh, look at those fucking boxes over there.
[162:44.82]There's nothing in there.
[162:47.76]Nothing in those boxes over there, but a couple of cool things.
[162:49.94]Alright.
[162:52.02]Combine.
[162:52.46]500 gold.
[162:55.22]I don't have any money.
[162:58.10]Oh, just bring out Lara.
[163:01.22]Let's win a tournament with Lara.
[163:02.49]Lara's gonna win us a fucking bunch of money.
[163:04.25]Guaranteed.
[163:10.27]Yeah.
[163:15.47]I'll have to pee again.
[163:16.17]To the ranch.
[163:21.73]Let's go.
[163:25.42]Combine with the worm.
[163:32.14]I'll save it, I'll save it.
[163:32.96]No, I'm not going to use the... Look, that butter plant.
[163:37.06]Rare, super meme monster.
[163:41.01]Is cheating.
[163:41.93]That is guaranteed.
[163:42.69]You just go to the last tournament and win $50,000.
[163:44.93]And you're just cheating.
[163:45.83]You're giving yourself money.
[163:49.82]So let's see here.
[163:51.06]Monster.
[163:52.94]Tons of intelligence.
[163:53.74]Let's go look at the moves too.
[163:55.96]So we got a good amount of defense.
[163:57.08]Good amount of intelligence.
[163:57.88]Good amount of skill.
[163:58.48]Good amount of speed.
[163:59.74]Life and power.
[164:02.75]Doesn't like potatoes.
[164:04.23]Likes rest.
[164:07.43]That's good.
[164:08.03]That's fine.
[164:10.51]We've got some basic tech here.
[164:11.75]We've got pat and kick.
[164:15.27]Both power moves.
[164:19.33]So... We need to probably work on that.
[164:27.03]Her power is pretty terrible.
[164:30.76]Drill.
[164:31.34]Let's just get the power up there.
[164:33.46]We have to.
[164:33.96]Otherwise she's going to be pretty useless.
[164:43.06]Nice.
[164:43.36]Success.
[164:48.10]118.
[164:53.70]You've run out of money.
[164:54.44]I know.
[164:57.19]Lara is doing well.
[164:58.15]Alright, let's do battle.
[164:58.95]What do we got for battles here?
[165:00.13]4,000 gold.
[165:04.39]I'm not going to be able to beat this.
[165:09.21]I'm going to get my ass kicked here.
[165:13.43]What if I just somehow luck enough she's got one loyalty not gonna happen just keep doing power Skipped That works for me No, I'm not using the cheating monster why is everybody want me to cheat so bad aren't you guys aren't we aren't you guys having fun I'm having fun We're not using cheats
[165:45.32]And... Success!
[165:49.98]Alright, 125's alright.
[165:54.22]Yes, I'm having fun.
[165:55.16]See?
[165:57.38]She doesn't like potatoes, so we're going to give her some milk.
[166:01.47]I've never given anybody anything else besides milk.
[166:07.69]How is it?
[166:13.69]And... Yes, who is it?
[166:16.81]You have mail.
[166:17.81]Thank you.
[166:19.66]It's from... Price reduction from... Errantry is usually expensive.
[166:27.72]Yeah, it's $1,000.
[166:28.40]I don't have any money to do that, though.
[166:35.31]We've got a D tournament.
[166:36.25]Not going to be able to do that.
[166:37.17]E tournament.
[166:37.67]There we go.
[166:38.07]1,000 gold.
[166:39.35]Disk chips.
[166:40.31]The Blizzard Cup.
[166:43.71]We're going to try to get in that.
[166:44.95]Okay, so we got one more day of work, a day of rest into the tournament.
[166:54.70]Power again, because that's all I can really do right now with the moves that she has.
[166:59.50]And success!
[167:01.45]Told you.
[167:02.89]Well, that sucked.
[167:09.55]You run out of money.
[167:10.19]Yeah, I know.
[167:10.87]Stop reminding me.
[167:16.00]Tibet.
[167:16.22]Let's see what the loyalty is.
[167:26.73]Loyalty 4.
[167:29.89]Damn it.
[167:35.42]It's just useless to go into the tournament with that little amount of loyalty.
[167:43.80]I could do a little bit of life as well.
[167:48.18]What do we have for a double here?
[167:49.10]We got power and life, and you lose speed.
[167:51.51]What is their speed?
[167:56.81]Speed is too important.
[168:00.61]Let's get some life.
[168:02.73]This one's just called Run!
[168:11.90]That's pretty impressive.
[168:14.32]Yeah, I was gonna say that was really impressive, actually.
[168:22.97]Six loyalty do it again.
[168:24.39]I'm gonna get over a hundred health Again run And go have the parrot just spinning around Damn these are terrible little increases
[168:50.58]This game warms my heart.
[168:52.36]It's great.
[168:54.58]It's a fun game.
[168:55.44]I'm about to run out of money.
[168:59.22]Let's do milk again.
[169:05.13]What if you don't have enough money to feed your monster?
[169:14.25]Official tournament at the end of the month.
[169:19.63]Okay, loyalty's at 8.
[169:23.84]Let's get some more... I need to get over 100 health.
[169:26.84]And then I'll be... I won't be confident, but I'll be, you know... Skip it!
[169:30.86]Good.
[169:32.82]Fucking hell.
[169:40.41]Is it really going to be that hard for me to get to 100 HP?
[169:42.05]Get over 100 HP.
[169:44.57]Come on.
[169:48.68]And do it!
[169:49.52]Fuck.
[169:59.74]I think I can't do that again.
[170:09.18]So why is there a fucking regular ass girl monster in this game?
[170:12.41]I don't know.
[170:13.59]It's not though.
[170:14.29]She's got wings.
[170:14.97]She's flying.
[170:15.63]She's flying around.
[170:25.34]Okay, that's an interesting... Uh, what do I got for stats?
[170:32.92]I... 98, 166, 126 power.
[170:35.62]I think I can handle it.
[170:37.52]I think I can handle it.
[170:38.18]What is there, loyalty 10?
[170:39.18]No, can't.
[170:40.82]That can't be 10.
[170:41.38]Let's get power up.
[170:48.56]I can't.
[170:49.32]I'm not gonna... We need to win a goddamn tournament.
[170:53.25]You know what I'm saying?
[170:55.60]I'm not just gonna sloppily enter a tournament and lose again.
[170:59.56]We need to be ready.
[171:04.91]We got enough money to feed her milk until two months from now.
[171:11.77]See?
[171:14.43]I got three months worth of milk.
[171:27.44]When a regular battle, tourneys are a little bit more hard, a little... pretty difficult, yeah.
[171:33.68]She's getting stressed out.
[171:35.30]Style, soft.
[171:40.98]How am I soft?
[171:46.80]Shit.
[171:50.65]Uhhh... Scald it.
[171:53.73]It said I was being too soft.
[171:54.95]Scald.
[172:02.25]Even.
[172:02.43]There we go.
[172:08.15]Let's get another one in power.
[172:14.46]Suspense kills me.
[172:15.14]I can't- I don't even see the last one.
[172:16.44]Good.
[172:17.22]Alright, 134.
[172:25.46]Alright.
[172:26.28]I gotta make an offer- I gotta make an, uh... I was gonna say offer.
[172:31.45]What do we got?
[172:32.45]Blue sky cup.
[172:33.71]Thousand gold.
[172:35.15]Four entrance.
[172:35.79]I should be able to win that.
[172:40.09]So that's one more serving of milk, and then time to win some money.
[172:43.25]I have to go to bed.
[172:51.10]Have some rest.
[172:56.44]I'm not reaching for the low-hanging jokes?
[172:57.95]What do you mean, low-hanging jokes?
[173:02.50]14 loyalty could be better.
[173:07.10]What do I want?
[173:10.14]Um... Life is so bad.
[173:11.64]Defense is good.
[173:13.58]Power's alright.
[173:14.30]The health is just really, really getting to me here.
[173:17.94]I need more health.
[173:19.52]Please.
[173:20.54]Just get somewhere over 100.
[173:21.32]No!
[173:21.38]Shh!
[173:33.01]No, don't scold it.
[173:33.81]What do you want for food this month?
[173:40.97]Alright.
[173:43.55]We're running out of money here.
[173:46.17]I have to win this tournament.
[173:48.74]Oh, the game's over.
[173:50.54]So... Let's make sure we win at least $100.
[173:58.87]This joke isn't funny anymore.
[173:59.99]You've said this milk joke 74 times.
[174:02.15]What are you talking about?
[174:05.63]What milk joke?
[174:08.47]Am I making a milk joke?
[174:09.61]I'm just saying that I have to give her milk.
[174:11.29]I don't even have any money.
[174:12.31]Am I joking about milk?
[174:16.66]When did I make a milk joke?
[174:19.80]Oh, he's talking about chat.
[174:21.58]Oh, I'm... I was like, am I making milk jokes?
[174:24.96]I must have... I'm like completely...
[174:27.76]I don't even, like, know if I'm saying them.
[174:29.44]I would be surprised.
[174:30.12]I'd be like, holy shit, I gotta, like, work on my mental fortitude here.
[174:32.67]Okay, let's do training again.
[174:37.17]Do it again.
[174:39.57]Power.
[174:44.00]One, two, success!
[174:47.80]Come on, what the fuck?
[174:50.98]More dog shit rolls.
[174:52.16]I need to rename this stream.
[174:53.88]Dog shit rolls.
[174:58.33]When's the tournament coming up here, right?
[174:59.62]Alright, let's rest to make sure she's ready and then win some money.
[175:05.64]She loves rest.
[175:10.48]No, training does not give money anymore in the second game.
[175:14.54]You have to win it in a tournament or you have to sell a monster.
[175:19.11]17 loyally, that's not good.
[175:20.85]But what can I do?
[175:22.13]We need to try to win 1,000 gold.
[175:26.21]Or at least even a couple hundred.
[175:34.70]Sell some of the walls.
[175:36.18]I could do that.
[175:36.62]That's a good idea.
[175:37.50]That's true.
[175:43.47]There's only four entrants.
[175:49.25]Let's win.
[175:54.57]Turned up a little bit here.
[175:57.46]Alright.
[175:58.62]We've seen these people.
[175:59.84]We know what they do.
[176:02.79]just hope I can get in third at least not last place to make any money I fare pretty well against this monster way but yeah this should be a clean win here how do I change the moon oh god
[176:33.25]What the fuck?
[176:39.29]Jesus Christ.
[176:43.19]Oh my god.
[176:44.25]Give me a fucking break.
[176:49.82]50 sec- Why can I not hit anything?
[176:51.94]This is so lame.
[176:53.70]You're just confused.
[176:57.64]That's fine.
[176:58.30]Just stay confused the whole time.
[177:00.76]It's un-fucking-believable.
[177:06.70]Can I, can I please fucking hit a move?
[177:12.81]Oh my lord.
[177:18.53]This is so... I literally can't even do anything.
[177:29.96]I can't do anything.
[177:34.02]And how does this make any sense that I only do...
[177:52.85]So, really, what realistically has to happen is I cannot do... I can't bring... This is a lot different than the first one.
[178:00.99]I have to actually get to, like, at least probably 40 or 50 loyalty.
[178:05.23]And... I don't understand the dog shit rolls I'm getting.
[178:12.00]Because, I mean, this is... Come on.
[178:13.52]Like, what the fuck is this?
[178:16.14]Because I'm just going to try to pat.
[178:19.28]Like, what?
[178:27.69]Oh, 41%!
[178:28.55]Please hit me and do fucking half my health pool.
[178:38.52]Oh, God.
[178:46.15]38%.
[178:46.33]Please keep fucking hitting me with less than 40%.
[178:50.21]I'm too confused right now.
[178:51.61]I can't help you.
[178:52.21]87%.
[178:52.23]Yeah, I tapped you for 8 damage.
[178:53.22]Now I'm going to die.
[179:27.75]I can't even attack.
[179:30.21]Oh, this sucks.
[179:33.29]Uh, I have no money.
[179:33.97]I'm going to completely run out of money.
[179:48.32]No, I'm not cheating.
[179:49.04]I'll never live that down.
[179:49.82]60%.
[179:52.08]Nope.
[179:52.26]50%.
[179:52.30]Yeah, please.
[179:52.60]Please hurt me.
[179:58.15]Please, God.
[179:59.29]Please, God, let me... I want somebody.
[180:02.07]I'm not even kidding.
[180:03.55]I want somebody watching the VOD right now to go back through the... to go through the entire fucking VOD.
[180:09.68]The whole VOD.
[180:10.28]The whole thing.
[180:12.88]If you got time.
[180:14.00]I'm not telling... If you got time.
[180:16.08]And find out how many times I've landed an attack in Monster Rancher 2.
[180:22.36]It's gotta be like 2 out of 10.
[180:23.38]Or 3 out of 10 times.
[180:24.02]You know what I'm saying?
[180:26.98]It has to be.
[180:40.92]Fuck, man.
[180:42.16]I can't get anything... Yeah, I'm just getting hit at 48.
[180:44.52]Let me out!
[180:45.20]58-7!
[180:45.28]Excuse me!
[181:00.84]Come on!
[181:01.28]Finally!
[181:01.70]You're scratching for 5 damage.
[181:03.36]All you gotta do is talk shit about it and you'll end up... No.
[181:13.00]But why is her damage so bad?
[181:17.05]Come on.
[181:22.89]Dude, she's got like 140 something power.
[181:30.69]I think we've been proven something here.
[181:35.04]You gotta take somebody and you gotta train the fuck out of them.
[181:37.94]And they have to.
[181:38.84]This is not like the first game at all.
[181:41.16]Completely different.
[181:45.49]She's an int fighter with no int moves.
[181:47.89]Yeah, what's up with that?
[181:50.59]This is like two int monsters in a row that didn't have intelligence moves.
[181:54.80]What the fuck?
[182:00.74]No, I'm not cheating.
[182:02.82]I refuse to cheat.
[182:06.26]We're doing the wall.
[182:07.20]Bring the fucking wall back.
[182:08.28]You're right.
[182:09.36]I'm going to combine... She's got good stats.
[182:11.50]I'm combining her into the wall.
[182:14.80]I don't have any money to do that.
[182:15.86]I'm gonna reload my save.
[182:33.15]They need to go to a university?
[182:37.89]No encouragement.
[182:43.53]I don't have enough money in the save either.
[182:45.07]Well, I'm gonna run out of money.
[182:59.24]Let's go back to town.
[183:00.86]And I'm gonna sell some people.
[183:05.66]Can I sell anybody?
[183:06.56]I wonder if I can.
[183:07.52]Let's see if I can sell her.
[183:17.17]What are you going to give me?
[183:19.59]It's the first time visiting here.
[183:20.63]Allow me to explain.
[183:25.91]This is the place where we give away free monster to trainers.
[183:29.87]The monsters we give away are three monsters.
[183:32.09]Moki, Zoom, and a seasonal monster.
[183:34.49]And we also buy monsters.
[183:36.24]Prices are determined by their strength... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[183:42.08]What would you like to do?
[183:43.72]Sell.
[183:45.24]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[183:48.22]Sell?
[183:49.66]We can pay 150 gold for your monster.
[183:51.98]Take it.
[183:59.38]Who do you have?
[184:03.72]I can just breed CDs.
[184:06.37]Okay, what do we got here?
[184:07.17]As the season changes, so does the selection of monsters.
[184:10.57]See, this one on the left, Butter Monster.
[184:13.99]Zoom, Moki, or Suezio.
[184:18.48]Who's Zoom?
[184:20.79]That's not bad.
[184:28.83]No, let's freeze out.
[184:30.33]Let's sell a couple other people.
[184:32.23]Who are we gonna... Let's revive... Let's revive Stein and then sell.
[184:42.66]That's a lot of skill, though.
[184:45.96]Let's see what we do.
[184:46.90]Let's see what we can get.
[184:53.86]He's gonna be worth a lot, right?
[184:55.68]At least a few hundred.
[185:03.86]That's no different than, like, selling chickens, alright?
[185:08.51]We can pay... 500!
[185:10.75]What the fuck?
[185:12.23]Why?
[185:12.73]Is it so... I don't even want him.
[185:14.55]Get him out of here.
[185:15.79]Get up.
[185:20.70]Okay.
[185:26.70]Give me a monster.
[185:30.00]I'm putting in another disk.
[185:32.75]I want something else.
[185:33.97]I'm so addicted to this stupid shit.
[185:36.71]What am I putting in?
[185:38.55]Okay, Dino Crisis.
[185:44.68]There it is.
[185:46.22]If you'd like to see.
[185:46.86]No, I'm not using the butter cheats.
[185:54.76]Dino crisis.
[185:57.12]There it is.
[185:57.50]See?
[186:03.92]Maybe we'll get a dinosaur.
[186:05.50]That would be cute, wouldn't it?
[186:15.97]Sell the butter?
[186:17.53]Oh shit, that's a good idea.
[186:19.83]I'm gonna- I'm gonna breed and then sell the butter and then I'm gonna breed- I'm gonna continue- I'm gonna keep breeding them.
[186:23.77]I'm gonna breed the butter over and over again and keep selling them.
[186:28.76]Stop it.
[186:29.48]Okay.
[186:36.30]You guys want me to cheat?
[186:37.00]That's how I'll cheat if I run out of money.
[186:43.34]Don't sell buttlust.
[186:45.10]That wasn't even his name!
[186:48.39]His name wasn't Buttlust.
[186:49.79]What was it?
[186:50.25]Was it Buttlust?
[186:59.60]Alright.
[187:00.36]Whatever this is, just let me use it for a little while.
[187:03.08]Something decent.
[187:04.87]Something I'm gonna train and love.
[187:08.01]Yeah.
[187:10.59]Yeah, I think so.
[187:17.13]That's a fucking weirdo.
[187:23.44]Oh, but he sucks.
[187:25.14]He sucks.
[187:28.15]No, that's got 192 life.
[187:28.65]Take him.
[187:28.83]There you go.
[187:29.09]Squash.
[187:50.77]Fucking Squarsh, that's his name.
[187:53.21]Is this Garfield?
[187:54.45]It's Squashed Garfield.
[187:56.15]Not Garfield, Sonic!
[187:57.91]No, why am I saying Garfield?
[188:01.47]Squashed Sonic.
[188:04.06]Squarsh.
[188:06.12]It's Beanbag Sonic.
[188:08.32]I like Beanbag Sonic, but no, but, uh, hold on.
[188:10.78]Beanbag Sonic might be perfect.
[188:16.06]Yeah, it's gonna be Beanbag Sonic.
[188:20.30]I don't care.
[188:20.98]That name better fit.
[188:21.84]Beanbag.
[188:22.72]Beanbag Sonic.
[188:24.22]It fits.
[188:58.44]Okay, his intelligence, what are his moves?
[189:00.76]He likes to play and he doesn't like tablets, good.
[189:04.90]His nature is best.
[189:06.12]What the fuck does that mean?
[189:09.07]Now we got slap and chop.
[189:15.31]Hit percentage A with a good, both a D force.
[189:18.51]So you're just gonna spam this move.
[189:22.62]Level up his power.
[189:23.40]What does he have?
[189:24.12]Wait, wait, wait.
[189:25.74]His power is 131.
[189:28.20]His defense is fucking awful.
[189:32.82]It is terrible.
[189:34.54]So we need to do power and... power and skill.
[189:45.24]I don't care.
[189:45.84]This guy is probably terrible.
[189:54.50]Does only do speed?
[189:57.00]Speed only.
[189:58.28]Because he's Sonic.
[190:01.01]Oh my god.
[190:02.51]You know, that's just dumb enough for me to want to do it.
[190:05.29]We don't have the kind of money to fuck around with that, guys.
[190:10.81]He is very fast.
[190:12.43]Do we have the... Power.
[190:18.47]Speed.
[190:19.09]Power and life.
[190:23.82]What the fuck am I doing?
[190:25.16]Why am I doing this?
[190:25.94]Move.
[190:36.18]Why would you stick out your leg?
[190:38.48]Why would you do that?
[190:39.42]Why wouldn't you just jump?
[190:47.55]He sounds so dumb.
[190:56.87]What is he not like?
[190:58.09]Well, you're getting fucking potatoes.
[190:59.75]No, you're getting milk.
[191:09.38]Oh, this monster just sucks.
[191:11.60]He sucks so bad.
[191:12.64]This is not even gonna be funny.
[191:13.76]I'm gonna freeze throughout the whole game.
[191:19.16]He has to eat potatoes.
[191:22.87]Five loyalty, though.
[191:28.17]I'll get it to 150.
[191:29.45]Why am I doing this?
[191:30.89]This is not even something worth doing.
[191:32.35]We have to complete the game, guys.
[191:33.99]How is he still missing this shit?
[191:40.93]He dabbed.
[191:43.13]No, he didn't.
[191:51.36]Well, his loyalty is going up really quickly.
[191:57.80]Can you please just get it done once?
[192:06.54]Nice, there it is.
[192:07.34]Alright, he did.
[192:14.37]He just did right there.
[192:15.35]Alright.
[192:16.29]Fine.
[192:16.71]You get that one, guys.
[192:17.57]I hate this.
[192:32.33]Again.
[192:32.65]Fucking idiot.
[192:38.38]Don't scold him.
[192:39.28]Let him go to bed.
[192:39.90]He's probably tired.
[192:43.66]He's just gonna have a steady, steady diet of potatoes.
[192:48.16]What is Sonic's favorite food?
[192:49.18]Hot dogs?
[192:56.60]Like, chili dogs, right?
[192:58.63]Was that only in the cartoon, or does he eat that in any other piece of Sonic media?
[193:08.67]He has to eat potatoes.
[193:15.60]Milk one more milk.
[193:17.50]And then it's only potatoes.
[193:21.84]I wish he would stop doing that.
[193:22.98]This is the second Sonic-related name in this series of streams.
[193:35.59]I know.
[193:37.14]It's not... It's not good.
[193:42.72]I wish I could do that.
[193:47.58]Okay, can I stop doing this stupid dumb joke now?
[193:50.76]No, he has to get to 150.
[193:51.48]There we go.
[193:53.10]Nice.
[193:53.26]That's five.
[193:53.80]148.
[193:53.91]One more and he'll get to 150 speed.
[194:08.86]Nice joke.
[194:13.86]This is not going to do anything for me, guys.
[194:17.41]Yeah, I skipped the dab.
[194:23.09]I'm going to... I tried to skip it, but I just froze it.
[194:26.19]Alright, we're at 150 speed.
[194:28.63]That's good enough.
[194:35.46]Seems well.
[194:36.36]Now we need to do...
[194:39.92]Power.
[194:42.14]We need power.
[194:45.70]What is his skill at?
[194:47.22]That's really important.
[194:48.84]Bad.
[194:49.26]I'm doing all skill.
[194:51.52]Skill only.
[194:53.74]Because I'm sick of missing.
[194:56.12]I'm getting to at least 125.
[195:13.81]I'm not doing any more speed.
[195:15.33]I'm going to lose everything and we're gonna have to start the whole game over.
[195:19.41]You really want to see that happen?
[195:21.11]We even won a single tournament in over three hours.
[195:23.90]You understand?
[195:26.50]We've been dicking around for a long time.
[195:35.60]Yes, yes, yes.
[195:36.58]I promise you that will be one of his top categories.
[195:41.92]Can you please just... God.
[195:43.60]I'm not gonna be able to ever make enough.
[195:48.86]I'm eating only potatoes.
[195:50.11]It has to be.
[195:52.63]Sorry, dude.
[195:55.15]You're only allowed to eat potatoes.
[196:07.13]This loyalty needs to get to at least 30 or 40 before I make any money.
[196:15.09]We can't make any money.
[196:15.91]It's been proven so many times.
[196:17.41]Loyalty has to be way higher than it is now.
[196:28.26]And now I don't have any money.
[196:31.44]15 loyalty.
[196:31.98]Keep it going.
[196:36.36]Oh, it makes me so angry that that's a thing he does every 15 seconds.
[196:45.20]Finally.
[196:46.20]Only one skill.
[196:56.87]Is it even worth doing that if I'm gonna get one point in it only?
[196:59.37]Fucking hell, it's like five failures.
[197:11.65]Ah!
[197:19.02]I have a strict style.
[197:30.40]That was cool.
[197:35.14]Plus 11 power.
[197:37.02]That's what I'm talking about.
[197:37.98]Nice job.
[197:49.10]Embrace the dab.
[197:53.00]What am I going to give him this month?
[197:57.08]Milk.
[197:57.68]I have enough to do milk.
[197:58.56]And plus, we can always go back and sell somebody else.
[198:09.57]He gets to eat well tonight.
[198:16.87]He's stressed out.
[198:20.01]He's well.
[198:22.19]22 loyalty.
[198:22.79]Look, there he is!
[198:23.39]He's running!
[198:23.75]Sonic the Hedgehog!
[198:25.65]Look at that fucking speed!
[198:32.34]Hey, hey, hey.
[198:33.14]Okay.
[198:33.66]Let's do power again.
[198:41.23]Great, right?
[198:42.05]Great?
[198:42.97]Great?
[198:45.15]Oh!
[198:53.85]He's doing so well in power.
[198:55.16]He seems a little bit tired.
[199:01.04]I'll let him rest.
[199:03.06]Look, everything's gonna be fine.
[199:04.81]I think this is the one.
[199:16.52]We're getting there.
[199:19.85]Although his defense, he... Well, I have a lot of speed, so we're gonna hope that that's gonna counteract the amount of defense I don't have.
[199:28.78]Let me see something here, though.
[199:33.88]Ah, easier it'd be for the monster to avoid an enemy's attack.
[199:38.92]I have to... You know what?
[199:39.84]You guys weren't, um, wrong.
[199:43.00]I do need a deckload more speed.
[199:44.62]Because he needs to be able to dodge instead of be hit.
[199:47.42]Nice work.
[199:48.26]Was that great?
[199:50.50]No.
[199:52.64]That's still pretty good.
[199:54.12]I want this over 160.
[200:01.36]No.
[200:01.68]Don't tell me to go for it.
[200:02.68]Stop telling me to go for it.
[200:03.78]He's not ready.
[200:06.24]He's not even close to being ready.
[200:09.74]I love that so much.
[200:12.67]I need to queue up, like, Angel Island Zone and play that next time he does this.
[200:17.57]Yeah, okay, hold on.
[200:18.33]Give me a second.
[200:25.33]He's still going, though.
[200:33.22]Can you guys hear this?
[200:40.62]No, you can't.
[200:44.36]Why is this 30 minutes?
[200:51.62]Yeah, the way that the audio is plugged in, you can't hear it.
[200:53.90]Where's he going?
[201:00.70]What is he doing?
[201:01.30]Oh, he's okay.
[201:02.28]He's fine.
[201:03.68]More speed.
[201:04.38]Give us more speed.
[201:10.52]Get a great.
[201:11.68]Great.
[201:12.90]Great.
[201:15.16]Look at him go.
[201:19.92]Nice.
[201:24.14]I've kind of... He's growing on me a little bit.
[201:27.13]He did the funny joke.
[201:28.19]That's right.
[201:33.03]We can do milk one more time.
[201:34.23]He has to win money or we have to sell someone.
[201:42.19]Beanbag Sonic is stressed out.
[201:49.19]Why?
[201:51.99]Okay.
[201:52.97]What do we got for upcoming battles here?
[201:55.37]There's one tomorrow.
[201:57.37]Look at his stats.
[202:02.23]Good speed.
[202:08.25]The skill is going to really start to bother me, though.
[202:14.48]Do speed one more time.
[202:19.46]Speed and then power.
[202:24.92]We need a great here.
[202:25.70]We need a good roll.
[202:30.76]It's okay.
[202:32.08]That's good.
[202:32.54]Good.
[202:38.74]He seems well.
[202:40.52]27 loyalty, that's not good enough.
[202:42.95]Get some more power in him.
[202:53.49]Whoa, he still did it!
[202:54.77]I mean, that wasn't great, but he still did it.
[202:56.21]I was surprised.
[202:56.89]Nice.
[202:57.43]Good work.
[203:02.59]Time for bed.
[203:03.27]Yep, let him sleep.
[203:08.20]No, no, don't.
[203:10.48]Rest.
[203:16.80]Get a mint?
[203:21.89]He's very well.
[203:24.53]Let's do power again.
[203:32.69]Come on... Yes!
[203:34.99]Look, this guy... I'm getting a good roll here.
[203:37.35]Because before, the last few monsters, I haven't been able to level up anything.
[203:41.64]They've failed.
[203:42.34]Like, 70% of the time.
[203:47.50]Alright, here we go.
[203:48.10]Time for potatoes.
[203:50.88]Unfortunately.
[203:51.42]Uh, I should level up life?
[203:59.15]Yeah.
[204:00.53]Good idea.
[204:05.13]I have mail, I can't afford it, it's gonna be a discount.
[204:15.43]He's stressed out.
[204:16.22]I think I'm gonna go sell somebody else.
[204:20.52]I would be stressed out too, with $30 in the bank.
[204:31.30]Yeah, that is stressful.
[204:34.40]Let's, uh, level up health.
[204:36.94]There's life.
[204:39.96]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[204:41.28]This is really, really, really fucking important.
[204:45.72]It just is.
[204:52.97]Okay, can you guys, uh, can you guys hear this?
[204:58.23]Can you hear that?
[205:02.98]You heard it, right?
[205:08.83]Good.
[205:13.85]Here we go.
[205:14.19]It's time to train him in running.
[205:31.75]Stupid.
[205:32.69]That was fucking stupid.
[205:33.96]That was not funny.
[205:49.27]Jeremy, you've run out of money.
[205:50.61]Okay.
[205:55.05]Thanks for telling me.
[206:00.52]Alright, wait, let's play this out.
[206:05.14]Oh come on, you fucking asshole, keep running.
[206:13.46]Ready, here we go.
[206:22.98]Where's he going?
[206:24.42]Come on Sonic, go around the other side!
[206:27.22]Quickly!
[206:28.54]Get those coins!
[206:32.65]Best work!
[206:38.14]Good work.
[206:41.94]What a terrible game franchise.
[206:44.98]There's the, that's it.
[206:46.16]Let me plug this back in.
[206:53.14]Coins, Frank, whatever.
[206:55.72]Same thing.
[207:04.51]Same difference.
[207:08.57]Stormlork just gave $50.
[207:10.69]5,000 bits.
[207:13.63]Thanks a lot, man.
[207:15.85]That said $50 joke.
[207:17.06]Thank you.
[207:19.40]But seriously, that's a lot of fucking money.
[207:21.00]Thank you, dude.
[207:22.22]Thank you, Stormlork L. Or Stormlord.
[207:25.26]Appreciate it, man.
[207:32.16]Loyalty 28 this guy been in a fight yet.
[207:33.88]No, not yet.
[207:35.46]Oh wait a minute.
[207:36.58]Ah, it's too late He has a great great You know, he just had he just can't fail he can't fucking fail He can't fail you see this he has not failed at all not one time he's perfect I
[208:00.10]In fact, I'm gonna feed him some good shit here because this guy's got potential to take us at least a few classes up, you know?
[208:08.81]We're gonna go sell the other fucking useless shitheads.
[208:13.33]Hold on a minute.
[208:14.05]I gotta piss.
[208:18.43]Let's save the game.
[208:19.27]I'm gonna take a piss.
[208:20.97]We'll come back.
[208:22.13]We're gonna make some money.
[208:35.28]That's fine.
[208:35.84]Save over this data.
[208:36.56]That's good.
[208:40.30]Don't you dare sell the wall.
[208:41.49]That was the first thing I was gonna sell.
[208:45.65]Let's freeze him.
[208:51.31]And then we're gonna pull him back out.
[208:52.35]Don't worry.
[208:55.69]And he even turns into the Sonic Ball.
[208:57.94]Perfect.
[208:59.99]Alright, who do we have back here?
[209:01.13]We have Banana Spit, Beanbag Sonic, and the Rind.
[209:04.22]Uh, Banana Spit, he's terrible.
[209:06.46]Get him out of here.
[209:08.12]Get out of here.
[209:15.44]Yeah, I could bring, oh yeah, bring in the new characters, bring in the old characters from the first game and just sell them.
[209:19.80]You got it.
[209:25.46]What can I get for him?
[209:27.72]Sell.
[209:30.43]Not well trained.
[209:31.53]So we can't pay for it.
[209:34.60]What?
[209:35.48]Oh, holy shit, dude.
[209:36.64]Edgehog is well trained.
[209:37.92]He's like a Class C, a Class B, isn't he?
[209:41.74]I... Yeah, let's bring him out.
[209:45.48]Edgehog... Wait, should I come... You guys are going to be mad at me if I don't combine Edgehog and Beanbag Sonic, right?
[209:51.92]I feel like people are going to be very upset about that.
[210:01.68]I broke a PlayStation 1 controller playing this game.
[210:06.38]Sell them.
[210:06.84]Sell them.
[210:07.62]Okay.
[210:08.54]Yeah, fuck that guy.
[210:09.34]That guy sucks.
[210:11.54]No, it's the shrine.
[210:12.06]It's the shrine.
[210:12.54]Shrine.
[210:12.86]Shrine.
[210:13.16]Shrine.
[210:17.36]We're just gonna scalp all these people.
[210:22.50]Pull them all out.
[210:24.14]Can I- can- you know, can you give me a deal if I sell them in bulk?
[210:35.34]Oh, here we go.
[210:36.20]Edgehog.
[210:36.84]Bring him in.
[210:37.20]Here's the big moment.
[210:41.29]Pull him out.
[210:42.49]And instantly sell.
[210:49.30]The stats are so good, too.
[210:50.54]I already know who it is.
[211:02.08]no no no if he's worth more than 500 he's gone cute yes it's a very cute monster do you want to take this monster to your ranch yes I do I have to give it a name it already has a name thank you for the register mark it what do you got
[211:35.34]The monster you brought is not... How?
[211:48.01]Oh.
[211:51.83]Shit.
[211:54.52]Well, that kind of throws everything out the window there.
[212:01.91]Was it pulling him through the wormhole from the first game?
[212:05.47]Gave him... bad stats.
[212:08.81]Shit.
[212:13.35]Sell the god monster?
[212:16.55]He's not gonna be trained.
[212:17.37]Alright, everybody hold on.
[212:22.90]Everybody just hold on a second.
[212:25.80]Hold on a second.
[212:27.14]Hold on one minute.
[212:29.60]We're going to see if we can sell the butter monster.
[212:32.00]We're going to see if we can just sell him.
[212:33.44]Okay, where is monster?
[212:42.65]There it is.
[212:46.17]If you want to call this cheating, you can.
[212:47.99]But I'm going to see if we can sell the Monster Rancher one monster.
[212:52.56]Or I'm going to bring him to a tournament and just win instantly.
[212:54.60]You know what I'm saying?
[213:04.68]Disk stone, pull it out.
[213:10.04]Okay, you've inserted the Monster Rancher 2 CD.
[213:15.49]Wait, hold on.
[213:17.91]I just read this disk.
[213:28.61]There's a monster on here already.
[213:32.97]Is this the hidden in plain sight thing where there's an amazing monster in here?
[213:39.53]No.
[213:39.97]It's fucking naked Bulbasaur.
[213:41.47]Get this thing out of here.
[213:50.80]It's got good speed.
[213:53.06]Just hold on to him.
[213:58.90]Just fucking sell me.
[214:00.22]Like, I don't even...
[214:03.92]I can't- I don't want to give him a name.
[214:04.98]I was going to write, I suck, but I don't want to do that.
[214:13.73]This is too much work for this person, because they're instantly going to get fused to soul.
[214:18.69]I got a P, bad.
[214:22.63]Okay, we're fine.
[214:23.13]There you go.
[214:26.52]Freeze him.
[214:27.60]We need some DNA later, you know?
[214:35.82]You sucks.
[214:39.82]You sucks.
[214:44.56]Alright, what are we doing?
[214:45.68]Going back to the shrine.
[214:46.32]And we're going to pull out the Monster Rancher 1 shit, you know what I'm saying?
[214:53.44]That was the plan the whole time, and it got confused there.
[214:58.02]I wonder if I can sell the bubbly butter.
[215:02.34]What was his name?
[215:07.15]Buttlast?
[215:09.39]Buttlust?
[215:11.01]It was Butterlust.
[215:11.91]No, it wasn't.
[215:12.96]I'm actually attempting to go back and look at the butt.
[215:23.02]Buttblast?
[215:24.94]Wait.
[215:28.14]Buttblast.
[215:30.34]Oh, my lord.
[215:31.44]What a fucking 10-year-old stream this is turning into.
[215:33.94]Yo, Butty!
[215:44.61]I got nothing man No, oh my god Not even funny, I'm just tired
[216:10.13]Alright, we already know who it is.
[216:11.35]Pull him out.
[216:12.55]See if we can instantly sell him.
[216:16.13]There he is.
[216:23.97]Purious.
[216:24.55]Mmm, wow.
[216:27.79]He only has one speed.
[216:33.38]So, what?
[216:33.86]It was Butterlust?
[216:35.88]Buttlust?
[216:48.96]Buttlust Blast.
[216:51.06]Buttlust, okay.
[216:51.82]Let's see if we can sell him.
[217:02.02]He's not trained, but can I sell you?
[217:08.81]Not well trained.
[217:09.41]Alright, let's just... I'm gonna... No.
[217:12.11]Let's bring him to the farm.
[217:12.99]And I'm gonna enter the most money I can possibly make.
[217:16.30]And I'm gonna just go and win it for... I'm gonna go and win it for free.
[217:20.92]Fuck it.
[217:21.30]Let's do it.
[217:22.46]Let's just cheat.
[217:23.64]To get, like, a thousand dollars-dollars.
[217:28.17]Just enter the first tournament you see.
[217:29.39]Doesn't matter what it is.
[217:30.41]Feed him a fucking potato.
[217:31.33]Who cares?
[217:38.76]Battle.
[217:39.66]Right now.
[217:40.02]800 dollars, uh... No, I want this one.
[217:44.40]This one's 2,000 gold.
[217:47.78]Yeah, just fucking... What do you got?
[217:50.21]What do you have?
[217:50.91]One in speed?
[217:52.45]Now you're gonna have two in speed.
[217:59.03]He's already out of the way.
[218:00.17]He's too good.
[218:04.33]He can see what's gonna happen before it happens.
[218:06.84]Cheat
[218:11.45]What?
[218:13.01]Butterlust cheated on his drill.
[218:14.83]Oh, I get it.
[218:25.41]What is going on right now?
[218:28.65]What the hell was that?
[218:39.16]He's dead.
[218:52.81]What's wrong?
[218:53.51]He's dead.
[219:00.52]I'm sorry about butt lust.
[219:02.50]Master, it's said every living creature will die someday.
[219:06.70]We can't fight against nature.
[219:09.16]Do you understand?
[219:10.50]Yes, I do.
[219:11.08]Okay.
[219:11.58]Died of natural causes.
[219:17.58]It is said that tough though a monster dies, its soul lives.
[219:21.40]How about holding a funeral ceremony for it and building an altar in order to pray for its soul?
[219:27.71]We can't afford a funeral ceremony.
[219:31.83]Ah, loving thoughts go out to buttlust.
[219:35.34]He cheated on his entrance exam and died in a shed.
[219:39.10]Okay.
[220:08.96]May you rest in peace.
[220:18.84]Now that plan did not go the way that we wanted.
[220:24.13]And we just used our last $30 to pay for a funeral.
[220:26.33]I'll be right back.
[220:28.21]I'm gonna pee.
[220:30.51]I'll see you guys in a moment.
[220:35.26]Your effect.
[223:01.04]Okay.
[223:02.97]Let's continue.
[223:12.99]Okay.
[223:14.57]So that means we have to... How much money do I have?
[223:20.44]Do I still have 30 bucks?
[223:21.32]I think he'll be okay to enter a tournament now.
[223:42.09]Ah.
[223:43.83]Crispy.
[223:46.03]Sonic can do it.
[223:46.69]Yeah, he can.
[223:47.13]He'll be fine.
[223:55.67]I just went and cried in the bathroom for a minute.
[224:03.01]You don't even get a eulogy?
[224:03.97]I don't even have time.
[224:04.69]I don't even know him.
[224:08.17]You know what I mean?
[224:08.65]Like, what do you mean do a eulogy?
[224:11.70]That's like... That's like... Okay, that's like I die, right?
[224:17.19]So I die, and you guys go and get somebody from the subway.
[224:23.39]You guys pull a random person off the subway and go, come with me for a second!
[224:26.39]And he's like, yeah, sure, what's wrong?
[224:27.41]What are you doing?
[224:28.55]Can you come with us just in this room?
[224:30.15]And he goes through, like, goes through the door, and he has to give a eulogy of my death.
[224:34.50]I didn't fucking know who the hell I was.
[224:39.16]You can't... What am I supposed to say?
[224:41.93]Ah!
[224:42.55]Buttlust.
[224:43.83]You know... He... I... He was yellow.
[224:49.30]And he smiled.
[224:51.98]He was a great man.
[224:54.16]The end.
[224:56.88]There's not much else to say.
[224:57.84]What was I doing?
[225:04.97]200-169...
[225:15.60]I'll do one more in speed, one more in power.
[225:18.12]That should be enough.
[225:22.76]And then we're going to... Where's it going to take him to a tournament?
[225:26.22]Give me a grade here.
[225:30.47]Sorry, he's working up the kinks.
[225:31.43]That's a lot.
[225:40.89]Can regular monsters cheat?
[225:42.25]I don't know.
[225:44.19]Probably not.
[225:44.75]That's probably just like a joke they put in the game.
[225:47.61]He's tired.
[225:48.11]Let's let him rest.
[225:56.42]That stupid emoticon you guys are doing.
[226:00.76]Alright, now battle.
[226:06.53]Got one for 500 gold.
[226:09.51]Okay, we're doing this one.
[226:12.05]One more into speed.
[226:13.33]He's got decent loyalty.
[226:19.39]I should be able to make some money here.
[226:27.12]Nice.
[226:27.56]Good job.
[226:30.64]Great work.
[226:31.06]175.
[226:32.94]Official tournament.
[226:40.04]Beanbag seems to be in good shape.
[226:41.28]Go for it.
[226:43.74]Yes, he is.
[226:45.14]Battle.
[226:46.72]So these are both official.
[226:48.28]Let's just beat.
[226:49.08]Let's make sure we... We need money.
[226:50.56]Bad.
[226:54.09]Still participate.
[226:54.85]I only have two moves.
[226:59.11]The moves I have are awful as well.
[227:01.45]So we need to just make sure we get in close and just dab.
[227:04.68]I was about to just say...
[227:08.76]I'm not gonna say that.
[227:10.42]I was... I was milliseconds away from saying that stupid fucking line.
[227:16.12]Nope.
[227:27.32]Bean butt bag.
[227:28.46]Alright, this guy, the hairball versus bean bag Sonic.
[227:36.39]What does he got?
[227:39.06]Be wary of its bad techniques.
[227:41.62]What was it again?
[227:43.94]He seems pretty bad.
[227:45.12]Be wary of bad techniques.
[227:46.70]Okay.
[227:48.17]So this guy's bad.
[227:58.77]Let's kick some ass.
[228:01.09]Yeah.
[228:02.07]Ah, excuse me.
[228:03.47]Uh, yeah.
[228:04.64]He has higher skill, but I got much better power.
[228:06.66]I can pack a bigger punch.
[228:09.94]We got slapped and we got fucking smear.
[228:15.93]Yeah, get slapped.
[228:17.01]Alright, now back it up.
[228:26.96]Get some distance.
[228:27.52]Get some distance.
[228:32.76]Nice dodge.
[228:33.60]Beautiful.
[228:34.40]Why are they booing?
[228:38.54]He's trying to get space.
[228:40.53]Chop!
[228:43.43]Chop him again.
[228:43.81]No, he ain't gonna hit me.
[228:50.93]Good work so far.
[228:53.81]Man, if he gets hit though, he gets hit bad.
[229:00.25]Break it up.
[229:04.76]Alright, I'm gonna win this one.
[229:07.56]This one's won.
[229:08.26]Victory.
[229:12.45]We're good.
[229:16.55]I'm concerned about getting hit, though.
[229:18.77]If you get hit one time, it... I need more skill.
[229:30.22]It's going to be a tough one going against Pancake Batter.
[229:32.78]I'm probably going to lose against Pancake Batter.
[229:38.23]Because he has a lot of...
[229:41.49]He has a really powerful move.
[229:45.53]Who wins this one?
[229:47.61]Yeah.
[229:50.35]Even if we don't win.
[229:51.21]Confirmation.
[229:54.39]He's got high skill.
[229:57.14]Try to KO it.
[229:57.90]So he's gonna be hit.
[229:58.68]He has a lot of good hit percentage.
[230:01.10]Well, shit.
[230:05.86]How to get more moves?
[230:06.80]I need enough money to be able to pay for the pay training.
[230:14.44]The defense is just killing me here.
[230:16.94]It's so bad.
[230:19.42]The defense is killing me.
[230:21.44]It's killing me.
[230:27.84]Get in close, come on.
[230:31.64]Good, make him waste his stuff.
[230:34.04]Get in there, 62.
[230:34.50]Nice hit.
[230:37.40]Again.
[230:38.02]Back to back, come on.
[230:38.78]Fuck you, yeah.
[230:39.54]Back to back, do it again.
[230:43.76]Shit.
[230:46.29]Oh, really?
[230:46.79]Right when I had the 84%?
[230:48.03]That's so bad.
[230:48.85]It's alright.
[230:49.93]I have so many guts.
[230:54.64]I need to use them.
[231:00.96]This is angering me a little bit here.
[231:02.84]Slap him.
[231:08.19]Stop angering your father.
[231:09.43]Thank you.
[231:19.86]Get one more move in here, right?
[231:21.32]No.
[231:21.47]I think I got it.
[231:22.69]Yeah.
[231:28.59]It's 2-0.
[231:31.45]As long as we win three, we're pretty much guaranteed to make money.
[231:39.81]And who wins here?
[231:43.53]Oh, wow.
[231:46.47]He lost.
[231:47.51]We have the best record.
[231:53.46]we have the best record so far alright this is the this is the all-important I have to beat this guy he's got high life this is where we're probably going to lose but you know at least we can try
[232:24.01]Actually, you know what?
[232:24.61]This is... he has really bad skill, and I have high speed, so he might not ever hit me.
[232:31.33]If we play this correctly, we should be fine.
[232:35.03]Should be though, that's the... that's the question.
[232:40.19]Yep.
[232:43.31]Two Sonics versus each other.
[232:44.39]No, it's not two Sonics.
[232:48.36]Fuck you, really?
[232:51.82]Dude, like, give me a fucking break.
[232:53.28]He's got a 35% chance to hit with a terrible skill.
[232:56.64]And I have like 170 speed, and I get hit by that?
[232:59.89]Where's the fucking logic?
[233:04.37]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[233:08.69]Are you shitting me?
[233:09.31]Give me a break.
[233:19.38]Confused.
[233:21.37]This is gonna be close.
[233:23.72]It's gonna be close!
[233:25.38]Do it again, quick!
[233:28.66]Back it up, just back it up, back it up, he won't hit you.
[233:32.22]Look at that.
[233:33.14]Perfect.
[233:33.90]Game over.
[233:35.46]I win.
[233:37.42]Finally.
[233:37.76]Gonna win a damn tournament for the first time in like four hours.
[233:45.28]You're eating fish tomorrow, I can guarantee you that.
[233:55.82]So who's the final match here?
[234:00.76]Two and one.
[234:01.32]I don't think it's possible for anybody to come in first place, even if I lose.
[234:06.01]This guy's two and one.
[234:12.63]Winning this would make him three and one.
[234:14.11]Yeah, we would tie for first place.
[234:19.90]He's got high skill.
[234:20.70]Alright, let me win this damn thing.
[234:33.58]Dab expert.
[234:35.32]His life is terrible.
[234:40.86]If I can land a few good hits and dodge and stay away from him, I should be fine.
[234:47.41]Let's see what we got.
[234:52.75]Of course you get confused, you dickhead.
[234:54.79]That's all I need.
[234:59.61]Again.
[234:59.85]Just unlock him.
[235:03.25]Knock him out.
[235:04.15]Knock him out.
[235:04.55]One more.
[235:05.07]Right up close.
[235:05.65]He can't move.
[235:06.81]Done.
[235:08.07]Game over.
[235:08.51]Okay, hold on a second here.
[235:12.92]Don't be so cocky.
[235:17.52]That's it.
[235:18.30]Game over.
[235:20.36]Won the shittiest tournament in the game.
[235:21.70]4-0.
[235:36.04]It is now no longer possible for me to lose this tournament.
[235:39.58]Right?
[235:40.94]Well, actually, that's not true.
[235:41.80]That means I'd have to lose two in a row.
[235:52.01]That guy's not won a single game.
[235:56.77]This guy's two and two.
[235:58.87]I need to win one more and that's it.
[236:07.48]Win this, take the prize.
[236:14.63]This guy sucks.
[236:16.99]This would be an embarrassment if I lost this.
[236:20.71]I mean, it just would.
[236:28.60]76 goddamn percent.
[236:29.62]That's 87%.
[236:29.82]This is how you lose.
[236:30.32]Say hello.
[236:39.14]769, aye aye aye.
[236:40.78]Alright, now I can just relax.
[236:48.78]Why is this telling me to fight, fight, fight?
[236:50.34]Why am I, I'm freaking out right now, why?
[236:55.58]Why is he doing this much damage to me?
[236:57.34]Back it up, back him up!
[236:58.40]Back it up, this is gonna be bad, back it up!
[237:02.18]No, you ain't gonna let this fucking happen, don't you dare.
[237:06.74]Holy shit, I'm gonna fucking lose.
[237:12.13]I'm gonna lose.
[237:15.65]I gotta hit him with this right now.
[237:16.83]Here it comes.
[237:17.19]Come on.
[237:19.39]You stupid shithead.
[237:20.79]Come on.
[237:21.47]Hit it.
[237:23.20]Yes.
[237:24.62]Oh, thank god.
[237:25.60]I think I just barely won.
[237:28.10]Wow.
[237:30.76]That's why he was winning.
[237:31.58]Because that lick does like 50 fucking damage.
[237:37.70]There we go.
[237:40.42]Goodbye.
[237:45.40]I'm not gonna see any of these dickheads ever again.
[237:46.97]I don't care who comes in second place.
[237:50.51]You know what I'm saying?
[237:51.33]Like, who gives a shit?
[238:03.18]Beanbag Sonic is the winner.
[238:05.64]Undefeated.
[238:07.62]Yeah, he's currently undefeated.
[238:11.27]Screen count.
[238:16.79]Rank one.
[238:20.95]Oh yeah, 750 Gs.
[238:25.28]And I gained eight fans.
[238:36.10]That's a pretty good thumbnail.
[238:37.22]That's a pretty good avatar.
[238:42.14]Someone's getting milked tonight.
[238:49.01]Jeremy, I think being bad at Sonic has learned a lesson in this tournament.
[238:53.29]Look at this shit.
[238:55.19]Didn't even have to do anything.
[238:56.47]He's learning on his own.
[238:59.65]He's doing such a great job.
[239:04.95]Praise him.
[239:12.50]What food do you want to give?
[239:13.62]Alright, let's go.
[239:14.78]You know, I think you deserve a little bit of milk.
[239:20.44]Let's not go too crazy.
[239:22.40]You know?
[239:23.14]We still only have... We have 780 bucks.
[239:26.56]It's not moving the needle or anything, you know?
[239:32.70]Why did we put Stein through college?
[239:34.27]It was a mistake.
[239:37.21]Oh, I need money now.
[239:42.21]Is this telling me that's cheaper?
[239:46.61]Wait a minute.
[239:50.42]Does this mean I'm a certified trainer now and I can go get the monsters that are in here?
[239:56.21]Based on your performances, we will grant you the rank mentioned on the right.
[240:01.11]It's the notice of trainer ranking.
[240:04.64]I guess I didn't tell you.
[240:06.12]Let's aim to become a master.
[240:08.88]So can I now unlock the monsters?
[240:17.39]I'm the first rank in the world.
[240:23.72]Alright, I'm gonna go see.
[240:30.91]Maybe I'd have to actually win a tournament before I can unlock any new monsters that are rare?
[240:41.68]Give him a nap.
[240:42.56]Alright, we're gonna get him some mints.
[240:46.22]I don't have any items.
[240:47.12]How much are they in this game?
[240:52.35]Yep, yep, yep.
[240:57.81]to Jeremy's place take good care of cult she's good she's cool okay uh bye mango candy these ones are the last smoke skate nobody likes smoke snakes
[241:22.00]Apple cake.
[241:23.60]Mint leaf.
[241:25.18]Its scent and flavor relaxes your monster and relieves its stress.
[241:27.78]Let's get one of these.
[241:28.46]These are 200 fucking dollars!
[241:39.62]I don't have that kind of money.
[241:44.82]This one's sick.
[241:45.42]This increases loyalty 600.
[241:48.32]No, I ain't buying shit.
[241:50.00]I'm sorry guys.
[241:50.72]We'll give it wait to wait for something.
[241:52.30]Just take a little bit of a break A little bit more training It's very well, okay training let's take a look let me look at me trainer
[242:13.40]My win percentage is 0.4%.
[242:16.74]What a great trainer.
[242:23.28]I'm gonna save it and relax.
[242:28.01]Save!
[242:28.81]Save it!
[242:31.33]I'm saving, see?
[242:35.39]So what do we need to work on?
[242:37.61]Obviously defense.
[242:40.69]Defense skill...
[242:43.35]Skill is important right now.
[242:44.54]Intelligence, who cares?
[242:45.60]He can be dumb.
[242:53.12]I mean, skill and defense are the easy ones to say.
[242:58.82]More speed!
[243:03.77]What am I doing this for?
[243:12.90]Just give him like 300 speed and try to never get hit.
[243:18.18]I guess that's the tactic we're going with.
[243:21.33]Just speed and power.
[243:23.39]If I get touched by one monster, I'm instantly gonna die.
[243:36.68]He is getting a lot... of points per...
[243:41.59]train here.
[243:42.39]At least like 8 or 10.
[243:43.07]Let's get this to 200 and it'll do some power.
[243:46.59]I may as well just do the speed anyways.
[243:54.16]Yeah, that's true.
[243:55.66]It's true.
[243:56.20]Although I'm going to be really angry when that one... But I'm getting such terrible rolls.
[244:01.52]You saw that guy with the 30 percentile hit me and I did like 60 damage.
[244:07.15]That's all I need is to get like halfway through the game and get killed.
[244:12.47]Because I get hit for like 180 damage in one hit.
[244:18.11]Which food do you want to give him this month?
[244:19.65]Um... We're gonna stick with the milk.
[244:24.17]It's the cheapest, most standard thing to give him.
[244:28.66]No stress.
[244:31.74]He needs new moves.
[244:32.62]He does.
[244:32.90]He has two terrible moves.
[244:34.30]But yeah, I need to... I need money.
[244:36.32]I need cash.
[244:40.64]I don't have any cash.
[244:46.34]It's $2,000 to learn a new move, potentially.
[244:57.57]Give me a great.
[245:02.93]Still no failures.
[245:03.81]He's doing so good.
[245:07.24]We'll get this to 200 as well.
[245:11.22]Stop feeding him milk.
[245:12.33]He's hungry.
[245:15.71]Just drink milk.
[245:17.17]You can live off of milk.
[245:18.07]200 speed, 200 power.
[245:30.86]Let's check out another tournament.
[245:34.21]That's going to be like 20 points.
[245:41.75]Oh, yeah.
[245:43.97]He did his best.
[245:44.93]Praise him.
[245:52.82]41 loyalty.
[245:53.48]Good, good, good.
[245:54.94]One more time.
[245:55.88]You can do it.
[246:00.25]Two, three.
[246:02.35]There it is.
[246:08.59]204.
[246:08.65]That's good, good, good.
[246:09.73]I'm happy, happy, happy.
[246:10.77]Say things three, three, three times.
[246:16.93]Alright, now he's gonna get a piece of fish.
[246:18.91]I can afford it.
[246:19.87]Fish.
[246:23.68]We worked hard for this.
[246:26.38]It's a fresh piece of fish.
[246:28.38]Now go win some more money.
[246:29.42]Official tournament at the end of the month.
[246:37.14]Let's see what it is.
[246:40.73]He's stressed out.
[246:41.49]I don't like that.
[246:42.13]So this is D. Six.
[246:53.69]Prize Magic Banana.
[246:57.57]You think I could do this?
[246:58.25]Alright, feed him a mint and go do this tournament.
[247:06.59]What do you think?
[247:07.63]Do you think I got a chance?
[247:18.94]That's a lot of money to win.
[247:19.90]I just have to get lucky.
[247:24.66]Let's get a mint.
[247:25.64]Feed him some mints.
[247:26.40]Let him just chill, relax.
[247:33.37]Mint leaf.
[247:34.59]Give it to him.
[247:38.27]We'll try this and hopefully we... I mean, even if we... There's only four entrants, so... I'm gonna give it a go.
[247:47.52]Let's try.
[247:59.07]This one's not going to take as long.
[248:00.03]There's only four people.
[248:09.02]Spring Cup.
[248:13.04]Mm-hmm.
[248:15.74]A lot of money.
[248:17.62]I could get so much more extra money too if I do well.
[248:21.99]Winston, Capella, and Sleep Bomb.
[248:27.18]Let's see who this fucking person is fucking.
[248:30.72]That's high life.
[248:34.38]Alright, let's go.
[248:44.01]Greed was my undoing.
[248:46.71]Whoa!
[248:48.09]But he has terrible skill.
[248:49.37]He's... Yikes.
[248:54.46]This is just a giant dog.
[248:56.14]What?
[248:56.46]This is just one of the sheeps from the fucking Serta commercials.
[248:59.52]Are you kidding me?
[249:00.14]Not good.
[249:08.67]Just stay back.
[249:15.13]That's all I need to do.
[249:15.89]And then just don't get hit again.
[249:18.49]It's easy as that.
[249:24.47]That's okay.
[249:25.07]Back it up.
[249:27.33]No, no, no.
[249:28.17]That's too much damage.
[249:31.37]I'm never gonna hurt this guy.
[249:32.55]I'll never get through this.
[249:33.27]Yeah, this guy's just... It's gonna be tough.
[249:43.67]Dodge again.
[249:44.09]Come on.
[249:44.45]No, that's it.
[249:44.95]Game over.
[249:46.27]This guy's not beatable right now.
[249:50.05]Not with... Wait a minute.
[249:51.39]Don't say that.
[249:52.01]Do it again.
[249:52.33]Quick.
[249:54.59]Come on, make me proud here.
[249:55.41]One more, that might do it.
[249:57.57]You dumb shit!
[250:00.53]Wait a minute, I got it.
[250:02.55]What do we got for percentage here?
[250:06.81]It's alright, that guy's gonna win.
[250:20.80]Just need to come in second or third place.
[250:24.71]I think baby's first swear words.
[250:32.11]Seems pretty bad.
[250:33.02]Okay, so this character apparently is fucking bad.
[250:36.06]Now does that mean bad like dirty, or does it mean bad like the character's not good?
[250:49.22]If I- I just gotta win one, and I get like 400 gold.
[250:54.54]They always have such gigantic defense.
[250:57.66]I was not ready for this one.
[251:01.66]I just have to rely on speed.
[251:11.19]Can I hit it again?
[251:11.69]Right off the bat?
[251:17.05]Nice dodge.
[251:26.02]That's fine.
[251:26.78]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[251:29.32]Nothing.
[251:29.96]That's fine.
[251:30.42]Give it to him.
[251:30.76]Give it to him.
[251:31.74]I'm right with the percentages here.
[251:33.36]He can't do anything.
[251:37.48]That was good.
[251:38.42]That's what I like to see.
[251:39.47]Again.
[251:42.83]Do it again.
[251:44.27]Keep the pressure up.
[251:47.09]Game over.
[251:50.63]He's got nothing.
[251:52.85]Now I'm guaranteed money now.
[252:04.43]Barely certain that it guarantees me at least a few hundred dollars.
[252:09.34]Now, if we come in second place, that's a pretty big deal.
[252:12.62]Or if he loses to Winston.
[252:14.92]He did.
[252:15.12]He just did.
[252:15.58]Okay.
[252:16.02]Okay.
[252:16.48]Alright.
[252:19.85]Everyone's got the same record.
[252:21.73]I just have to beat Winston.
[252:26.23]This just got interesting.
[252:27.19]Okay.
[252:27.59]Our opponent has high skill.
[252:33.87]Roll the dice, guys.
[252:34.49]Let's see if we get any money.
[252:40.39]There's a chance to win.
[252:42.79]I have a chance to get that secret banana.
[252:46.88]Oh boy, oh boy.
[252:50.22]I just gotta get him.
[252:50.96]I gotta get a couple of hits.
[252:53.18]I just gotta get a couple of hits.
[252:55.35]If I land like even two or three hits, I have a chance to win.
[252:57.97]Because look at his power.
[252:58.71]It's awful.
[253:06.50]That's fine.
[253:06.90]Just get a big hit here.
[253:12.36]Again.
[253:14.91]That's what I'm talking about.
[253:15.67]Game over.
[253:16.09]I win.
[253:17.31]You lose.
[253:17.67]I gotta get in close.
[253:29.52]Don't let him just chip you down here.
[253:34.84]Keep back then.
[253:35.46]Fine.
[253:37.26]K.O.
[253:38.26]Give me that two grand.
[253:39.20]Thank you.
[253:45.21]Gotta have faith in being Bagsonic.
[253:49.85]Now we can probably learn a new move.
[253:51.87]Because I just won.
[253:56.45]Oh, maybe no, I didn't.
[254:00.81]Shit.
[254:01.41]No.
[254:01.89]He's gonna win.
[254:04.03]No, Sleep Bomb.
[254:05.80]Ahhhh.
[254:08.74]tie-breaking match with Sleep Bomb, the guy that just kicked my ass.
[254:19.82]No, this guy's not beatable.
[254:22.14]His defense is too high.
[254:23.40]I just have to get lucky.
[254:29.42]I really just do.
[254:33.00]Got it.
[254:33.72]Luck has to be on our side here.
[254:38.89]so far so good come on give it to me he's fooling around no fooling around good dodge back it up back it up back it up back it up stay away stay back you gotta go for dice rolls here for real I need dice rolls now
[255:13.06]Give me the rolls!
[255:14.86]Yes!
[255:20.91]That's alright, just pull it back.
[255:22.77]Don't get hit by a gigantic move here.
[255:25.19]Last hit!
[255:28.47]Don't let him do anything!
[255:29.79]Keep him stun-locked!
[255:33.48]That's it.
[255:35.98]We get the magic banana.
[255:36.72]I don't know what that means.
[255:44.05]I don't know, does that give you something cool?
[255:49.25]That's gonna be like three grand.
[255:54.47]Very nice.
[256:06.51]That was a D cup too, I could definitely do the D, the actual D cup.
[256:13.65]What about the money?
[256:14.25]That's it, bonus.
[256:16.39]2150.
[256:17.61]And I got a magic banana.
[256:24.80]And how many fans?
[256:28.51]Double that fans.
[256:30.41]Looking good so far.
[256:42.81]Combine them with the wall?
[256:43.95]Absolutely not.
[256:45.50]I'm just going to get a hairy wall.
[256:46.76]I don't want to do that.
[256:47.26]A hairy blue wall.
[256:51.72]I think beanbag has learned a lesson.
[256:55.75]It just surprises me more and more every day.
[257:02.95]Great work.
[257:06.27]Let's go see what this thing does.
[257:10.25]Just let him rest.
[257:11.45]No, item.
[257:13.33]Use.
[257:14.63]Its effect differs each time you feed it to your monster.
[257:17.37]Mysterious banana.
[257:22.91]What does it sell for?
[257:23.67]I got a magic banana here, man.
[257:29.16]100 bucks.
[257:30.58]Get out of here.
[257:37.32]I'll use it at some point.
[257:46.24]Game saved.
[257:47.34]Rest up.
[257:47.78]You deserve it.
[257:49.58]And then we're going to train him and hopefully get a new move.
[257:51.40]A hundred bucks is a lot for bananas.
[257:58.49]Yeah.
[257:59.61]It is.
[258:02.09]Alright.
[258:03.13]Errantry.
[258:04.41]Time to learn a new move.
[258:08.54]Or should I do this?
[258:09.04]Should I wait till it's cheap?
[258:14.85]Maybe I... No.
[258:15.47]Maybe I should... The amount of times that we've seen the thing in the mail.
[258:18.41]Maybe it's not a good idea to save.
[258:25.52]Yeah.
[258:25.68]Let's just wait for a discount.
[258:27.58]It's not worth it.
[258:28.12]Let's just keep training random shit.
[258:32.77]Let's do more speed.
[258:33.63]Let me just see what happens if I do defense.
[258:38.65]I don't think we've ever... We've never even seen this.
[258:42.98]Might as well just see what it does.
[258:46.06]Oh, it's like a Super Mario 64 level.
[258:50.88]Okay, well, did he make it?
[258:52.91]Yeah, he wins.
[258:54.17]Yeah, just get hit by every single thing.
[258:57.01]That's how you win.
[259:03.79]Official tournament?
[259:04.97]No.
[259:05.93]Not happening.
[259:06.37]That was a pretty good job.
[259:09.28]Let's do that one more time.
[259:16.57]Bang.
[259:17.97]Two.
[259:19.39]Three.
[259:21.11]And victory again.
[259:21.93]Alright, I'm happy with that.
[259:27.96]That's a huge increase.
[259:32.46]And let's feed him a fish.
[259:38.85]Hope you like it.
[259:40.49]Costs a lot of money.
[259:48.12]Soft Loyalty, $49.
[259:52.04]When's the actual Spring Carnival?
[259:55.68]$1,000.
[259:55.76]No, when's the next official tournament?
[259:57.34]The actual Gemini Cup?
[260:01.62]No.
[260:01.96]Official Cup.
[260:04.60]I might actually skip everything and just train the hell out of them.
[260:11.74]I think that sounds like a good idea to me.
[260:14.62]Just so I can be ready.
[260:18.69]I just missed it.
[260:19.31]Yeah, that gives me enough time to get tons more stats.
[260:27.93]I'll get to, like... I'll get to, like, 250 speed.
[260:37.00]250 speed... We need skill, too.
[260:40.14]I can't ignore it.
[260:42.62]That's a mistake to ignore it.
[260:46.81]I gotta say, the 40% percentage is really... The 40% percentage is actually irritating me.
[261:07.37]Take a sleep, buddy.
[261:08.65]You deserve it.
[261:15.60]Something fun to note here, he has not failed a single piece of training.
[261:21.88]Not one time.
[261:25.00]I really don't think he's failed one time.
[261:35.09]Keep up that 100%.
[261:35.55]Time for a failure.
[261:46.10]Same thing, fish again.
[261:51.40]He failed skill training at the very start.
[261:52.86]Oh, he did?
[261:53.34]Well, all I'm wrong.
[261:59.87]Blueberry mashed potatoes.
[262:06.07]Do another speed.
[262:06.73]Actually, no, he did fail a bunch of these in the beginning.
[262:16.32]Not for long.
[262:21.50]221.
[262:23.26]You failed five times in a row and you got angry.
[262:33.65]No, not defense.
[262:37.89]What did I say?
[262:38.19]You want to get 250 speed?
[262:44.58]We need to get a good roll.
[262:45.74]A great.
[262:46.48]$2.50 actually might take a little bit of time.
[262:55.31]Give us something in the mail.
[262:56.11]Give us an envelope.
[262:58.97]Where's my envelope?
[263:00.05]Style Fond.
[263:00.97]What does that mean?
[263:06.57]Make that shit 50% off.
[263:22.39]seems tired when is it it's next uh next week maybe two more things of training try to win some more money do the double stat training I want to see we got fish cup of jelly this gelatinous food is for busy monsters
[263:56.80]What is it?
[263:57.42]Busy... Should I feed this to him?
[263:58.97]Busy monsters?
[264:03.03]How about the banana?
[264:06.91]Save and then use the banana.
[264:11.25]Uh, okay.
[264:15.56]I can't.
[264:16.22]I have to feed them something.
[264:19.98]Just give him some milk?
[264:23.88]Yeah, he's been getting fish, like, every day.
[264:32.13]And by every day, I mean every week.
[264:37.69]He's too old for milk.
[264:41.82]He's too old for that milk.
[264:45.10]Alright.
[264:48.28]Let's save Scum the Banana and see what happens.
[264:53.94]Okay.
[265:02.92]Item.
[265:07.02]Magic banana.
[265:09.98]Eat it.
[265:15.16]His eyes gouge out of his brain and blood goes everywhere and he like screams and disintegrates.
[265:21.27]I don't know what that would even do.
[265:23.37]What does that do?
[265:41.88]It's getting hot in here.
[265:43.64]Check the stats.
[265:47.63]I don't think it did anything.
[265:53.53]Should I reload it?
[266:04.86]Lower loyalty, longer life.
[266:10.90]Alright.
[266:11.16]No, I'm alright with that.
[266:14.44]Longer life?
[266:15.02]I want to keep him around for a long time.
[266:20.15]I'm fine with that.
[266:20.73]That's cool.
[266:23.97]We got more lifespan now.
[266:38.28]He's so good at that.
[266:39.16]I love it.
[266:42.34]$2.50, right?
[266:48.23]Today is his birthday.
[266:51.03]Shall I sing something?
[266:53.53]Me, me, me.
[266:58.24]Happy birthday to you.
[267:00.60]Happy, happy, happy, beanbag Sonic.
[267:06.63]grow and be a strong monster.
[267:10.40]This is not how happy birthday goes.
[267:12.24]How is my song?
[267:18.86]Not bad, huh?
[267:20.36]I bet he liked it too.
[267:27.87]A present.
[267:29.95]Oh, it's a birthday cake.
[267:43.87]Aye, aye, aye.
[267:44.59]He's well.
[267:47.47]When is that battle?
[267:48.63]We got one more day of training.
[267:55.79]Power and life.
[267:57.93]Another speed, then we'll rest.
[268:04.02]This might get us to 250.
[268:09.84]Good dodge.
[268:15.04]So close.
[268:16.12]248.
[268:21.94]Seems well.
[268:23.02]We're gonna go with... Rest.
[268:27.50]And then try to win the official D cup.
[268:34.98]Oh, what do you think?
[268:36.44]Should I get defense up a little bit more?
[268:38.08]Or should I try for the official tournament?
[268:44.45]Here we go.
[268:45.51]Oh, no.
[268:46.19]Skipping the tour- Tournament's done.
[268:47.37]Skip the fucking tournament.
[268:49.07]Not doing any tournaments.
[268:50.15]Sorry.
[268:51.63]Because this is, uh, 50% off everything.
[268:53.79]I guarantee it.
[269:00.41]It's the shop.
[269:08.48]From now on, beanbag's Sonic strength will be affected depending on how we raise it.
[269:12.52]This is where we must use our training skill.
[269:18.19]Well, I mean, might as well go buy.
[269:20.90]We said we were going to wait for the sale.
[269:31.50]So we got mint leaf.
[269:33.14]That's not even a sale.
[269:35.54]That's barely a sale.
[269:36.89]Come on.
[269:39.19]Where's the 50% off?
[269:39.89]I'm going to buy one of these just to have one.

[270:49.31]A little bit of power.
[270:50.01]You get a little bit more defense.
[270:52.47]Curious how this is going to go.
[270:56.48]By the way, we're going to continue this tomorrow night as well.
[270:59.54]So if you were curious as to what we're doing tomorrow, it's this, baby.
[271:05.04]It is this.
[271:08.57]Because I love this game.
[271:10.17]It's a lot of fun.
[271:17.96]I beat all these guys already.
[271:19.06]Except for this dude, Palmer.
[271:22.54]He's got high life.
[271:27.18]So do I, though.
[271:31.54]Good luck!
[271:44.03]31 power.
[271:44.35]Okay, he's an intellect.
[271:47.80]He could hurt me a lot.
[271:50.12]I have, like, no intelligence defense.
[271:51.56]It's alright, though.
[271:54.40]Let's just get it going.
[271:57.83]Oh, boy.
[271:58.11]I gotta get it close.
[271:58.73]I gotta get him close.
[271:59.71]He won't be able to do any intelligence moves if I stay close.
[272:03.69]Just don't let him, uh... I can't let him bridge, uh... Come on, really?
[272:09.15]He'll never hit me with that if I stay in close.
[272:15.99]Yeah, he is screwed right now.
[272:23.10]Four damage.
[272:23.70]Don't make me laugh.
[272:31.03]Don't let him go that way.
[272:32.13]No, no, no, don't.
[272:32.83]Go, go, go, go, go.
[272:33.63]Close, close, close.
[272:40.01]Same stupid slap move, man.
[272:41.53]We need a new move so bad.
[272:48.08]and that is a that's a victory three two one right at the buzzer see you no one can stop the fastest bag alive I agree hail falls a person we haven't seen yet so what is that is it a dinosaur
[273:17.40]Beetle.

[273:20.33]Sakuraprit.
[273:26.89]Seem to be evenly matched.
[273:27.83]Okay, here we go.
[273:31.82]Hailfall.
[273:32.90]Let's see.
[273:35.58]Has very high defense.
[273:39.70]Let's hope you also don't have very high offense.
[273:53.86]Uh, this actually might be hard.
[273:58.74]His skill is awful.
[274:00.66]He's going to have a tough time hitting me.
[274:02.59]But if he does, his defense is... That's crazy.
[274:11.17]It's like a lobster.
[274:12.05]What is this guy?
[274:13.11]He's like a crab.
[274:14.33]He's like a scorpion lobster.
[274:15.66]This is not what I wanted to have happen.
[274:24.30]This is not good.
[274:29.48]Give it to me.
[274:29.82]Come on.
[274:33.65]Shit.
[274:34.19]This is not good.
[274:35.05]This is really bad.
[274:35.95]How is he hitting me this often?
[274:37.09]I got like 250 speed.
[274:39.49]You tell him he's gonna hit me like fucking 7 out of 10 times?
[274:41.65]8 out of 10 times?
[274:45.39]Finally.
[274:52.54]Come on.
[274:53.14]Give me a break.
[274:59.26]Dodge it.
[274:59.76]Dodge it!
[275:01.54]How are you not dodging this shit?
[275:05.24]He's gonna win.
[275:06.32]Crit.
[275:06.52]Right at the end.
[275:08.07]Come on.
[275:08.79]Right... What's the percentages here?
[275:10.59]Come on.
[275:11.85]Yes.
[275:17.96]That's a cool monster though.
[275:18.80]I like that lobster.
[275:29.34]So now I can see why people told me to play the second one just to skip the first one after we played it for a couple times.
[275:34.84]Because there seems to be a lot of different monster combinations.
[275:39.38]This is kind of just Monster Rancher 1, but just more stuff.
[275:43.78]So, now I understand why people wanted me to kind of skip the first game.
[275:53.67]Palmer sucks.
[275:56.07]Yes, he does.
[275:58.51]Winston, apparently.
[275:59.25]We've beaten Winston before.
[276:02.17]We're both 2-0.
[276:05.35]I've taken him on before.
[276:13.43]Yep.
[276:14.43]I just got to hit him a couple times.
[276:18.56]We both have really good speed.
[276:19.64]He's got really good percentages, but percentages don't matter if you have no health.
[276:31.69]And again, like, I do need to get a hit.
[276:35.29]Not getting those percentages now, am I?
[276:37.98]Come on, dude.
[276:40.02]Give me a break.
[276:41.34]What is up with that shit?
[276:44.80]Finally.
[276:51.90]There we go.
[276:53.44]He's as good as dead.
[276:55.72]Game over.
[276:57.04]That's it.
[277:03.99]Water dog trash.
[277:07.89]Go back to Twilight Princess.
[277:09.17]That was a water dog, right?
[277:15.24]There was water in that game that you could swim in as the... ...dog, right?
[277:32.02]You know, I was just going to move on from that one.
[277:34.38]There wasn't water in that game.
[277:35.72]The dog is swimming.
[277:43.40]Yes, there was water in that game.
[277:44.78]Yeah, there was.
[277:45.84]Good for you.
[277:51.27]Low health.
[277:55.53]Low speed and low health.
[277:59.20]Better high defense.
[278:00.20]Gonna have to do some zoning here.
[278:07.78]I needed that.
[278:11.38]There it is.
[278:16.78]Don't blow it all.
[278:17.72]Here, just stay back.
[278:23.43]Oh my god.
[278:26.01]Don't let him do the fucking cube move again.
[278:31.04]By the way, 81%.
[278:31.64]Oh, that was such horseshit.
[278:41.81]Give me a fucking break.
[278:43.89]Give me a fucking break.
[278:54.46]Nah, that's over.
[278:58.23]No, it's over.
[278:58.95]Unless I get a fucking... No.
[279:00.05]I gotta get a crit right here.
[279:01.61]Right now.
[279:01.91]Come on.
[279:04.67]Wow!
[279:13.98]Got it.
[279:17.06]Made up for it.
[279:17.54]That's good.
[279:23.65]It is now potentially impossible for me to lose.
[279:28.04]Winston.
[279:28.40]If Winston loses right here, then I just kind of win by default, right?
[279:33.10]Or actually, Sakura has to lose right here.
[279:38.98]And you didn't, so... Okay.
[279:44.80]Winston also has to lose.
[279:46.04]He did not.
[279:53.18]So I need to win.
[279:56.56]This is it.
[279:58.19]Already beat you once.
[280:10.58]Don't ask me how, though, because you're way better at everything than me.
[280:15.98]Wow, actually, this might be bad.
[280:20.27]Have I?
[280:20.77]I don't know, I've never faced this person before, have I?
[280:23.55]Why are your stats so out of control?
[280:36.98]Come.
[280:43.86]Gotta get in there.
[280:45.10]Get in there.
[280:50.70]Don't do that shit right now.
[280:54.80]And... I'm gonna take a Christmas miracle here.
[280:57.77]No, not gonna happen.
[281:08.97]Why are you even allowed in this tournament?
[281:11.01]You have like 40% stats than everybody else in the whole tournament.
[281:15.71]Yeah, this is game over.
[281:19.86]That's irritating.
[281:26.08]Big crit!
[281:27.16]Again!
[281:27.94]At the buzzer!
[281:29.95]No.
[281:30.85]I lose.
[281:41.03]That was like half a confusion thing.
[281:43.05]Fuck that.
[281:44.98]I'm gonna have to fire.
[281:45.90]I'm gonna have to do it again.
[281:47.96]Unless you lose.
[281:52.50]That's tight.
[281:55.86]Alright.
[281:56.40]Come on.
[281:57.12]None of these fights even matter.
[281:58.32]They all lost.
[281:59.84]Looks like we just fought for the last place.
[282:01.30]Good for you.
[282:06.11]Alright.
[282:06.39]You know what?
[282:07.35]Sometimes you just have to go for Hail Marys.
[282:11.25]This guy blows me out of the water in stats.
[282:13.37]So we're just going to go for Karate Chop crits.
[282:15.47]That's it.
[282:17.45]Nothing else.
[282:23.02]He trumps me in almost every category.
[282:24.88]Especially the ones that matter.
[282:27.64]Skill, intelligence, his power.
[282:29.90]I mean, I got him in speed and power.
[282:33.66]But man, that skill and if he hit... Nah, let's go.
[282:37.97]Just karate chop the fuck out of him.
[282:39.17]Didn't work.
[282:50.43]Good dodge.
[282:53.82]Dodge.
[282:54.42]Good.
[282:54.84]Good.
[282:57.70]Let him waste his... Okay, that's fine.
[282:58.96]You can take that damage.
[283:00.32]Crit.
[283:04.31]Oh, please.
[283:05.51]Oh, great.
[283:07.59]I gotta hit him with something.
[283:13.59]Hit it again.
[283:14.63]Yes.
[283:15.35]Good.
[283:18.79]Don't let him do that.
[283:20.12]Thank God.
[283:23.72]Crit!
[283:25.14]Ah!
[283:27.46]Dodge it!
[283:30.52]Get him with one more hit!
[283:31.62]Come on!
[283:33.30]No!
[283:34.64]Don't let him do a move!
[283:36.12]That's not a good- Not a time to get confused twice in a row!
[283:38.58]Are you serious?
[283:40.11]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[283:42.07]Unbelievable.
[283:42.71]I just lost.
[283:43.95]Didn't I?
[283:48.85]B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b!
[284:02.30]That's a win.
[284:14.13]I'm an official cup.
[284:15.57]$12.50.
[284:21.36]And?
[284:27.80]Nine more fans.
[284:28.96]There are 25 people watching this stream right now.
[284:32.86]There actually is 25.
[284:33.74]There are 2585.
[284:36.35]He has almost as many viewers as I do.
[284:42.45]He's doing... That's pretty fucking awesome.
[284:44.63]Good for him.
[284:48.33]That's a lot of bits.
[284:49.17]Good.
[284:55.90]Good.
[284:58.55]Yeah, we definitely need some more defense.
[285:01.99]And probably intelligence too.
[285:08.43]Beanbag says, I want to play with you next week.
[285:13.67]Do you grant its request?
[285:18.31]I don't understand.
[285:18.91]Yeah, I want to play with you next week.
[285:23.23]Yes.
[285:25.70]Beanbag, Sonic, you can play next week.
[285:31.80]Huh?
[285:34.16]Which food?
[285:35.58]Let's go with, um... He's been pretty busy.
[285:39.56]Let's give him some jello.
[285:42.84]He's been very busy.
[285:47.15]Yeah, he can talk.
[285:48.33]Why can he talk?
[285:49.43]So Sonic can talk.
[285:56.04]Look at this.
[285:56.64]A diamond mark.
[285:59.55]If we collect five of these, we'll get a fun can.
[286:03.57]I always wanted this as a kid.
[286:05.33]I'll keep this.
[286:08.49]Yes, who is it?
[286:09.01]Here we go!
[286:09.47]No, it's not.
[286:13.07]Damn it.
[286:13.31]This is just saying, hey, you get to go to C-Rank now.
[286:22.79]Just five?
[286:23.41]We get to collect five Danintops.
[286:27.11]And you'll get a couple of number two pencils for your skull.
[286:32.90]Uh, second rank.
[286:38.50]Colt, did you hear about the meat?
[286:41.36]What are you talking about?
[286:42.12]It's not good for you.
[286:44.53]D, don't be silly.
[286:47.07]A battle between Aima and Fimba is finally about to begin.
[286:50.97]How can I not be excited about this?
[286:53.27]Really?
[286:54.68]FIMBA is the neighboring continent's monster association, isn't it?
[286:57.66]Remember in the last game, when you were part of that organization?
[287:02.68]It's finally confirmed.
[287:04.48]Sonic will finally be in Smash Bros.
[287:08.06]Eight years ago.
[287:08.90]Every four years, we will select representatives from five different grades.
[287:12.33]It's a five-on-five battle.
[287:15.71]Representative.
[287:17.07]Representative!
[287:18.67]Representative!
[287:19.99]I don't wanna- That's a fucking commercial, isn't it?
[287:21.75]Like an Allstate commercial?
[287:24.04]I guess we cannot be the one.
[287:26.00]No, if you win the victory at elimination tournament held at the end of this month, you can be the one.
[287:31.90]Colt and Jeremy, why don't you enter the tournament?
[287:35.38]Yes, I would love to do that.
[287:37.40]Don't you agree with me, Jeremy?
[287:38.87]Yes.
[287:39.79]Okay.
[287:44.17]It's great to be a representative.
[287:46.35]You gotta be one.
[287:47.31]Yeah.
[287:48.07]Beanbag Sonic depends on us too much.
[287:50.43]I guess we spoiled it.
[287:53.12]Didn't you make a promise to Beanbag Sonic that you'll play with him?
[287:56.56]Well, are you going to play with him?
[287:58.26]Yes.
[287:59.38]Good.
[287:59.68]Beanbag Sonic will be happy.
[288:02.18]There's the meme voice.
[288:03.06]There it is.
[288:04.86]Let's go play.
[288:12.29]Aren't you happy with the nice weather, Beanbag Sonic?
[288:16.33]I'm gonna play with you, as I promised.
[288:19.33]Yeah, how do you play?
[288:21.70]I'm gonna explain about the Pushing Sumo now.
[288:24.97]When the words Ready Fight appear, press one of the following buttons.
[288:31.75]The O means Rock.
[288:33.45]Rock, Paper, Scissors.
[288:36.35]Okay.
[288:37.97]The hand on the lower left is Beanbag Sonic's hand, and the hand on the lower right is yours.
[288:44.53]After the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, the winner of the game gets to launch the first attack.
[288:49.49]If it's a tie game, press that button consecutively.
[288:51.75]If you press enough times, you can obtain the privilege of first attack.
[288:57.39]When you attack consecutively, press the button indicated on the screen below.
[289:01.31]What is going on right now?
[289:02.99]However, the button will not have any effect unless the consecutive hit sign appears first.
[289:08.09]If you push the radar icon below the screen and all the way to the left, you will win the game.
[289:14.53]If you're forced all the way to the right, you're gonna lose.
[289:18.00]Do you want me to... No, I think I... Rock, paper, scissors, and then tap the button.
[289:25.00]Ready?
[289:29.76]Wait.
[289:37.16]Anybody following this at all?
[289:44.03]I... What is it trying to do here?
[290:00.19]Uh, I... Am I supposed to be tapping circle?
[290:14.36]Don't I have to do... I guess we're gonna lose.
[290:19.22]What the hell was that?
[290:35.22]He dabbed on you.
[290:37.00]Oh, hey guys guess what he dabs every time he wins He dabs every dude not even when he wins he dabs every sing.
[290:46.58]That's one of his three animations You look he's gonna do it all the time You know no
[291:01.72]This is my favorite of the animations, though.
[291:03.44]It's just him frolicking and having so much fun.
[291:08.53]Alright.
[291:10.51]What do we want to increase here?
[291:18.78]Defense is terrible.
[291:21.28]Intelligence is kind of out the window for me right now, but defense isn't.
[291:24.08]Shouldn't be.
[291:25.42]That needs to be at least 100.
[291:26.26]Um, we could do skill...
[291:35.17]I'm just out of curiosity.
[291:36.55]Let's go to Errantry for a second.
[291:41.83]Because if we do speed, skill, and life... Speed and life... I've got, what, I've got four options here?
[291:48.81]Speed and life, power and life, int and life, skill and life.
[291:52.99]So if I do power... If I do speed and life... It seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique there.
[292:02.30]Should we do speed and life?
[292:03.80]But it's $2,000.
[292:04.92]Do you want to send your monster to the Saren Tree?
[292:13.56]No.
[292:13.80]Power and life.
[292:16.88]What about this?
[292:17.64]It seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique there.
[292:20.24]Watch out for the sponge.
[292:24.47]No.
[292:28.83]Skill and life.
[292:30.45]So there's a chance everywhere.
[292:31.47]It just depends on what I want.
[292:34.94]I almost just pressed yes.
[292:36.92]My whole body just hurt.
[292:42.04]No, I want it to be cheap.
[292:45.64]Style dotting.
[292:46.78]What the hell does that mean?
[292:49.64]Ooh.
[292:52.10]Okay, hold on.
[292:55.84]Crab cup?
[292:57.51]Papa's Cup.
[292:58.33]What's the one that we needed to do?
[293:01.69]This one, right?
[293:02.21]Elimination, see?
[293:03.39]I'm going to get my ass kicked here.
[293:07.11]Crab's Claw, pure gold.
[293:09.63]Or... A Nagiel?
[293:12.39]I mean, this one's 2,000.
[293:22.71]You get the... You get a Nagiel prize.
[293:35.89]Your monster's fame's gonna drop.
[293:37.09]I don't give a shit.
[293:42.23]That's $2,000 for free.
[293:49.91]So I'm probably gonna... We'll do... We'll get to the... We'll do this.
[293:53.05]We'll rest up.
[293:53.61]We'll train him maybe once.
[293:56.21]And then I'm going to... I'm probably gonna stop streaming for tonight.
[294:00.26]And then we'll start up again tomorrow.
[294:03.62]Same time.
[294:05.09]Go for about like five hours or so tomorrow too.
[294:08.03]Same game, Monster Rancher 2.
[294:13.29]I assume for all of the Monster Rancher streams, you can assume there'll be at least like five to six hours.
[294:22.24]What does fame do?
[294:23.00]I don't even know.
[294:27.50]Although there's a chance I could lose this.
[294:32.64]That reduces lifespan?
[294:33.82]I can just sell it, can't I?
[294:39.43]I should be fine here.
[294:40.21]I could speed to back it up.
[294:44.47]I do need to move... I need to move bad, you're right.
[294:46.29]Right off the bat, we're going to take a huge amount of damage.
[294:50.53]That's okay.
[294:59.22]Twice in a row.
[295:03.39]We're good so far.
[295:06.21]80%.
[295:06.27]Take it.
[295:10.21]And chop.
[295:10.61]Aye aye aye.
[295:11.43]It's okay.
[295:12.79]Don't let him do the cube.
[295:15.61]He's confused.
[295:17.69]Take that to the advantage.
[295:23.77]No cube.
[295:31.28]That should solidify it, even if we get hit by the cube.
[295:34.32]We didn't.
[295:39.81]Knock him out.
[295:41.05]Oh, he had one HP left.
[295:42.57]Good for you.
[295:45.01]You know, at least he tried.
[295:46.13]0.8% health.
[296:03.28]You beat the prosciutto dress monster?
[296:07.94]Prosciutto- wait, prosciutto, like, the- the sandwich prosciutto?
[296:12.52]The meat prosciutto?
[296:17.11]Well, that thing sucks, whatever it is.
[296:19.55]That thing didn't even stand a chance.
[296:22.37]Whatever it is.
[296:22.95]I don't even need info.
[296:25.21]It's a shitty koala bear.
[296:27.80]Let's give him the slap chop, you know what I'm saying?
[296:36.37]Oh, yeah.
[296:36.95]He sucks.
[296:43.30]Watch this.
[296:43.96]One-hit kill instantly.
[296:47.38]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[296:49.52]Alright, hold on.
[296:51.28]No, don't get cocky.
[296:56.94]Stay in his face.
[297:02.35]I so badly need another move.
[297:04.49]I need to do something else.
[297:06.37]Besides just the swing the arm around and slap in face.
[297:10.97]I have to have a different move.
[297:17.85]What's going on here?
[297:19.43]He's back to life.
[297:22.31]With a move called Grit.
[297:26.87]How much we lose here?
[297:29.08]Nah, get fucking slap-chopped again.
[297:31.77]Grit my ass.
[297:32.97]Stay down.
[297:42.69]I'll take that 2,000.
[297:46.68]Winston versus Capella.
[297:48.12]Yeah, we just have to beat the... This guy was weak.
[297:56.10]This guy, the same guy he always had.
[297:57.38]Wait, he might... Not anymore.
[297:58.54]He might have higher health now.
[298:02.52]Dude's got 89 health.
[298:11.15]86.
[298:11.39]That's so bad.
[298:12.31]You can't have 86 health in 82 defense.
[298:16.49]If anybody touches you, even if they suck, you have to have some health.
[298:21.64]You either have the cushion of the health or you have the... I don't know, the armor for the defense.
[298:26.08]You can't just have neither.
[298:27.40]Look, I just did one slap and I won already.
[298:33.80]There's not much he can do now.
[298:35.10]He has to bring me down to like 130.
[298:36.66]It's over.
[298:40.71]How are you winning two in a row?
[298:41.91]How does this guy win?
[298:42.89]How are you winning?
[298:44.83]You should be losing every time.
[298:46.09]It's over.
[298:58.55]I feel bad because I keep KOing him and I'm probably going to kill him eventually, accidentally.
[299:05.21]He's probably going to die here, eventually.
[299:09.72]That's it.
[299:17.74]Victory.
[299:21.20]BBS is a bully.
[299:23.28]Oh, BBs?
[299:26.00]Don't call them BBs.
[299:28.88]Oh, God.
[299:36.51]2,100?
[299:36.69]2,200?
[299:36.71]Good.
[299:37.23]We gained an item.
[299:46.82]Lost four fans, whatever.
[299:52.22]Lil' BBs.
[300:00.12]Alright.
[300:03.20]That's gonna wrap up the stream.
[300:05.75]We'll start from here.
[300:06.75]We got a bunch of money.
[300:11.77]He learned some lessons.
[300:12.75]Good.
[300:13.01]He got... Wow.
[300:16.49]That's like a... That's pretty much like a full training right there.
[300:19.34]For free.
[300:25.24]I'm not gonna praise him.
[300:27.12]I'm not gonna praise him.
[300:27.74]Because we were spoiling him, right?
[300:30.85]Is that a mistake?
[300:33.31]That may have been a mistake, but it's okay.
[300:37.82]Let's save the game.
[300:39.00]And that's gonna be the end of the stream.
[300:41.32]See you tomorrow night for this.
[300:44.88]Before you go, though, we've got some stuff to look at here.
[300:47.02]We've got to talk about subs, the resubs, and the bits.
[300:50.67]If you're just here for Monster Hunter and you want to watch tomorrow, see you tomorrow.
[300:55.29]We will start exactly where we left off right here.
[301:00.55]Game is safe.
[301:02.87]Alright, so... Thank you to all these subs, the resubs.
[301:06.23]Here they come.
[301:11.30]with our new and improved credits.

[303:48.78]I asked you guys specifically if you wanted me to slow that down.
[303:52.29]And everyone said, no, don't, no, don't.
[303:55.53]That's going to keep happening if I don't.
[303:59.45]I just can't.
[304:02.33]I get stuck and I see a name that I recognize.
[304:05.47]And I'm like, oh, hey.
[304:06.86]And then by that point, it's over.
[304:09.24]Next time I do this, I'm not going to do that.
[304:11.18]Next time I do this, I'm going to just read every name.
[304:13.74]I'm going to read every name.
[304:19.45]I'm not going to say anything about it.
[304:20.51]I'm going to just say thank you.
[304:21.59]I'm going to read every name.
[304:24.57]I just... You know what?
[304:25.61]Fine.
[304:25.99]Fuck it.
[304:26.89]I'm so confident that I'll be able to do that next time.
[304:28.72]I'll make it like 10% faster.
[304:35.84]But thank you so much to everybody that subbed.
[304:37.42]A lot of you long-time subs.
[304:39.02]Thank you.
[304:39.70]A bunch of mods were on that list.
[304:40.78]A bunch of familiar names that have been subbed for like almost two years.
[304:45.26]So, thank you guys so much.
[304:48.36]And now let's get to the bits.
[304:51.06]Let's start back here with, now I can just change over to the normal outro here.
[305:00.88]Hey, look at that.
[305:05.88]Let's go all the way back.
[305:08.92]Ivory, thanks for the 50 cents.
[305:10.00]So are you gonna address what the clue, the vacalentary means?
[305:16.59]Or do you still wanna keep chatting in the dark all stream?
[305:19.47]Welcome black, bless.
[305:21.74]Oh, you're talking about the vacation lantern.
[305:25.44]I was just saying random words.
[305:28.96]I want to go on vacation and I've needed a lantern because my house has been pitch black.
[305:32.58]So there you go.
[305:33.10]Those are the two stream of consciousness things that you got.
[305:36.67]But thank you.
[305:38.81]I can still hear this music.
[305:39.73]I need to take it out of my headphones because it's driving me nuts.
[305:45.37]Thank you, though.
[305:45.87]Also, thank you to Stormlord.
[305:49.02]Stormlork gave 25 cents way earlier on top of his pound of money he gave over the course of the stream.
[305:57.72]Thank you, Stormlord.
[305:59.84]Sawdust Bunnies, thanks for the $1.
[306:02.60]Superintendent Chalmers, thank you for the 60 cents.
[306:10.72]Is that a Simpsons character?
[306:11.90]No, it's Superintendent Skinner, right?
[306:18.30]Who's the superintendent in the principles, in The Simpsons?
[306:22.32]What's his name?
[306:31.85]Oh, it's from the steamed clams thing.
[306:33.65]It's from the, oh, these are hams.
[306:35.63]What are these, steamed hams?
[306:37.61]No, they aren't.
[306:38.73]Actually, they're burgers.
[306:40.47]No, I don't know about this, Principal Skinner.
[306:42.49]And then he leaves.
[306:43.11]I've seen the house burns down.
[306:44.19]The Simpsons is old.
[306:49.47]I've seen it before.
[306:52.96]Steamed chalmers.
[307:00.91]Watch steamed hams on stream.
[307:04.99]No, I refuse.
[307:16.37]If you don't have the whole steamed hams bit memorized by heart, are you even a real teen?
[307:22.81]Apparently not.
[307:24.61]But thank you to... Stormlord again for the $1.84 earlier.
[307:30.27]Bit bidding war.
[307:32.80]Between who?
[307:33.36]Wait, you got in a bidding war for what?
[307:34.94]What are we bidding on?
[307:37.48]Thank you.
[307:37.76]Thank you Hasnain119 for the $1.
[307:40.14]I got a medal for like three minutes.
[307:44.80]I get a medal for like three minutes.
[307:48.02]I don't know what that is, but thank you.
[307:50.34]Hydra725, thanks for the $1.
[307:52.30]Last night I ate a half done at McDonald's.
[307:54.84]Now I have terminal butt disease and my body stores pee in my butt cheeks.
[307:59.08]I don't know why I read them, but I do.
[308:02.95]Thanks for the $1, Hydra.
[308:04.29]Appreciate it.
[308:04.83]Thank you, Danger Illustrated, for the $5.
[308:06.39]I love your music.
[308:09.27]Please come to Maine.
[308:13.25]Um... Danger, I...
[308:18.37]You think you're on like a different stream?
[308:23.25]One of these days I should just get like a keyboard in here and just play the fucking keyboard and just wow you guys.
[308:27.85]I'm talking like wow you guys.
[308:29.30]I'm gonna do it.
[308:31.54]You'll see.
[308:34.34]You don't think I know how to play the keyboard or play the piano?
[308:37.74]I'm going to make you guys rethink everything you know about me.
[308:43.16]We'll see.
[308:46.46]Thank you, Danger Illustrated, for the $5.
[308:47.98]Thank you, Benjo313, or Benj0313, for the $5.
[308:52.25]Appreciate it, man.
[308:54.19]Being a resident of Phoenix for 19 years now, I can tell you moving to buttfuck nowhere Arizona is a very poor life plan.
[309:02.86]Maybe.
[309:04.76]But it's also a lot cheaper than Massachusetts.
[309:07.87]And I'll have electricity during the winter.
[309:10.03]Because that's been like a really annoying problem the last winter or two.
[309:14.39]Is losing electricity for almost three or four days straight.
[309:19.21]That sucks.
[309:20.49]Especially in the winter.
[309:21.15]Because it's cold.
[309:23.20]It was snowing out here.
[309:26.64]It was like 30 degrees.
[309:28.20]It snowed.
[309:28.62]We got like 15 inches of snow three days ago, two days ago.
[309:32.82]Not good.
[309:34.44]Ow.
[309:34.58]Fucking SEGA CD.
[309:39.14]Uh, it's not cool.
[309:39.80]Let's move to Mars.
[309:46.02]You got a buddy in Tucson.
[309:46.92]He likes it.
[309:47.50]Arizona's cool.
[309:51.56]Move to Las Vegas.
[309:53.06]Just outside of Vegas.
[309:55.47]God, the pretty lights would just keep me entertained.
[309:59.37]You're never gonna lose power if you live in Las Vegas.
[310:02.43]That shit is turned on 24-7.
[310:03.53]They're gonna have a power outage in Las Vegas.
[310:07.41]Ain't gonna happen.
[310:09.53]You've seen it.
[310:09.97]Look at all those lights.
[310:11.44]That shit never turns off.
[310:18.90]Move to Texas?
[310:19.62]You're like the tenth person to tell me to move to Texas.
[310:23.22]And I'm actually considering that because of how many people have told me to do it.
[310:29.89]California's cool too.
[310:30.89]Okay.
[310:32.55]Texas.
[310:34.11]Arizona.
[310:35.21]Nevada.
[310:36.23]California.
[310:38.51]Ohio.
[310:40.33]Michigan.
[310:42.15]No, I'm kidding.
[310:46.71]Pennsylvania.
[310:48.03]Pennsylvania is pretty cool.
[310:52.53]California sucks.
[310:53.39]California is... I like California.
[310:56.25]I like California.
[310:57.17]I like... I don't like Los Angeles, like downtown LA, California.
[311:02.38]I like...
[311:04.58]The outskirts in the Los Angeles area.
[311:07.84]I like Burbank.
[311:09.82]I like places like, you know, around like Silver Lake.
[311:13.88]Those places are really nice.
[311:15.50]They're quiet.
[311:16.08]They're not fucking crazy.
[311:18.70]Every time I go to downtown Los Angeles and I go to Hollywood, some guy stops me.
[311:22.90]Have I ever told you this story of the guy that stopped me?
[311:27.15]I'm gonna hold on to this story because I'm gonna tell it on stream with more people here.
[311:30.85]I like filmed a guy's like jokey prank video for him in Hollywood.
[311:36.17]This was like last year.
[311:38.03]He just handed me his camera and he was like this weird fucking prop comedian.
[311:42.23]And he was like, hey, can you film me for a second, man?
[311:43.71]Film me, film me.
[311:44.67]And I'm like, I don't.
[311:45.37]And he's like, yeah, just try.
[311:46.42]I need someone to film this.
[311:48.48]And I filmed him for like fucking 25 minutes doing dumb, weird shit.
[311:54.60]I didn't know what the fuck to do.
[311:57.23]He was making weird jokes into the camera.
[311:58.93]He didn't have a cameraman.
[311:59.91]I became his fucking cameraman.
[312:04.35]Don't ask me what the fu- I don't know how it happened.
[312:08.83]You had to run off with the camera.
[312:14.04]That's not a lie.
[312:14.92]I swear to God.
[312:17.08]This actually happened.
[312:17.98]I'll tell the whole fucking story start to finish.
[312:19.72]And I will fucking- I will search for the video.
[312:26.31]It was one of the strangest experiences of my whole life.
[312:29.55]What was his name?
[312:30.14]I don't know what his name was.
[312:32.86]You think I was asking that guy what his name was?
[312:34.66]The guy that, like, stuffed a camera in my face and was like, yeah, take this for a minute.
[312:38.26]Let me tell you something.
[312:39.68]Hey, America, let's talk about it.
[312:41.01]And he did, like, a bit on camera, and then he, like, jumped over a railing.
[312:46.55]And then I handed the camera back, and I'm like, okay, bye.
[313:00.07]cameraman streamer prank there's a longer story there because he followed and Kim can corroborate this story this dude followed us around we went to get coffee afterwards and you could tell he was still looking for a cameraman and like I already had done it so me and Kim went into a coffee shop to get coffee and you could see the guys like the guy was looking in the window of the coffee shop to see if we were still in there
[313:26.31]Like, oh, man, I gotta do something else, like, fucking stupid.
[313:29.95]Is that guy still in there?
[313:32.91]Oh, it was fucked up.
[313:33.69]It was so dumb.
[313:35.75]I will never live in Hollywood.
[313:44.17]Because I was the one sucker idiot that ended up, like, instead of being like, no, sorry, dude, no, I can't.
[313:51.11]I actually think I told him I can't.
[313:53.47]Because we were going to get coffee.
[313:55.11]I'm pretty sure, maybe I'll get Kim to recalibrate this story with me.
[313:59.32]But I'm fairly certain I told the guy, no, I'm not going to do that.
[314:08.92]He said he was like a comedian and like a YouTuber.
[314:10.73]And I was like, oh, who cares?
[314:18.09]He's probably outside your window right now looking for a cameraman.
[314:24.48]No, this was in Hollywood.
[314:34.73]I actually, I like Burbank.
[314:38.53]Burbank, of the dozen or so plus, like, maybe 15 times I've been to California in the last, like, four or five years, I think Burbank is my favorite town.
[314:49.12]Or city, whatever.
[314:50.76]Or county.
[314:51.60]I don't even know what you call it.
[314:53.48]I've been to San Francisco, I've been to Burbank, I've been to Irvine.
[314:57.49]I've been to pretty much all the major spots in California.
[315:01.09]Burbank is just nice.
[315:02.11]It's quiet.
[315:02.70]Nobody fucks with you.
[315:04.28]There's no weirdos with like weird agendas that want to have you film them.
[315:08.50]It's gonna be me one day.
[315:12.81]But anyways.
[315:14.27]We'll talk about this some other time.
[315:15.49]Even though we just spent like 10 minutes talking about it.
[315:19.96]Were they at least funny bits that he did?
[315:21.52]No, no, no.
[315:23.63]He said like a couple things about America.
[315:25.87]He made like a couple like awful America jokes.
[315:29.41]And then he just, he jumped over a band, like he went up to where we were, the coffee shop was kind of on a little hill.
[315:35.81]Like maybe four feet off the ground, maybe, not even, like five feet.
[315:39.37]He went up a couple of ramps.
[315:40.65]He went to the top of that and just vaulted himself over the railing onto the ground.
[315:48.29]It was like, ah, yeah, like he was doing like a weird I jump over stuff video.
[315:53.43]And it was supposed to be like funny.
[315:56.25]I don't know the guy.
[315:57.06]I don't know if the guy may have been on drugs.
[316:00.64]If he wasn't, maybe he just liked to do that, maybe.
[316:11.82]Was he old?
[316:12.46]I don't know.
[316:12.84]I have no idea.
[316:13.28]I don't know how old he was.
[316:14.32]He was older than me.
[316:22.75]What if I was being filmed the whole time?
[316:27.08]I don't know.
[316:27.92]I'm probably somewhere on the internet, just standing there like a dickhead.
[316:33.68]Anyways.
[316:36.20]Thank you for your $5 Danger Illustrated.
[316:40.68]And your $5 Bench for your Phoenix reference.
[316:47.35]Thank you, Sergeant Chickenwing, for the $1.50.
[316:49.31]After checking the blue screen error code you got, it might be possibly faulty drivers.
[316:54.04]Reinstall all the drivers for relevant hardware and remove any daemon tools or any ISO reading software you might have.
[317:00.78]Appreciate the tip there, Sergeant Chickenwing.
[317:03.29]I did find out what the problem was.
[317:04.53]I have a bad stick of RAM.
[317:07.73]I need to get new RAM.
[317:08.73]Thankfully, it's that easy.
[317:09.93]I hope it is at least.
[317:12.15]We didn't have any blue screens.
[317:13.67]The computer's been on and running fine for over five and a half hours now.
[317:17.57]So, thank God it was just a stick of eight gigabytes of RAM.
[317:22.70]So I just have to replace it.
[317:24.40]Thank God.
[317:25.76]Don't need more bullshit in my fucking life right now, at this very second.
[317:29.12]Because that would have been a disaster.
[317:33.63]If it was one of those cases where I had to continuously figure out what was wrong...
[317:38.65]Pulled the goddamn computer apart.
[317:40.13]Do I have a bad motherboard?
[317:41.17]Is my power supply fucked up?
[317:42.43]That's like a- that's like two weeks worth of annoyances.
[317:46.25]And I don't even know how the hell I would be able to stream.
[317:52.07]Gotta keep your RAM in the refrigerator or it'll spoil.
[317:54.38]I know.
[317:54.58]The RAM is expensive.
[317:59.78]I actually- okay, so I have um... Did RAM go up?
[318:03.82]Did the prices of RAM increase over the last year or two?
[318:07.98]What happened?
[318:10.61]Okay, so I have in my computer right now the RAM that went bad.
[318:13.27]It was a Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 8 gigabyte sticks of 3000 megahertz, right?
[318:20.21]It was $129 last year when I bought those.
[318:22.03]It's like fucking $220 or something for the same RAM that I bought last year.
[318:35.72]It's Bitcoin crypto miners?
[318:37.99]I thought that was GPUs, not memory sticks.
[318:41.45]That's $100 more expensive than it was last year.
[318:51.67]RAM's been up for a while since the boom in gaming.
[318:53.70]I don't think BTC miners need RAM.
[318:55.58]Yeah, they use GPUs.
[318:59.08]Yeah, it was $129.
[319:02.52]Memory shortage has nothing to do with crypto.
[319:04.12]It's an industry drama thing.
[319:08.02]Yeah, I saw that and I about screamed.
[319:10.30]You know what I mean?
[319:12.46]I thought something was wrong.
[319:13.26]I was like, no way.
[319:14.36]Is this the right brand?
[319:17.18]But yeah, that's a pain in the ass, but whatever.
[319:19.02]There's a worldwide shortage.
[319:23.80]What am I talking about?
[319:24.51]I'm talking about RAM and how there's a RAM shortage apparently and I had to spend a hundred extra dollars on the same RAM that I bought two years ago.
[319:31.99]Exact same brand, exact same model, exact same speed.
[319:36.39]So that's kind of what we're describing.
[319:40.35]Anywho, let's move on to... Thank you, I appreciate the help, though.
[319:45.83]It was kind of annoying for a little while.
[319:48.69]Thank you, Proceph, ProStar, for the $1.
[319:51.75]Stormlord, thanks for the $5.
[319:52.81]Wait, what was ProStar's message?
[319:54.39]Beware the Ides of March.
[319:58.41]15th of March.
[319:59.98]Oh yeah, it is the 15th of March.
[320:03.52]Well, everything's fine.
[320:05.10]Thank you, Proceph, for the $1.
[320:07.89]Thank you, Stormlord, again for the five bucks.
[320:09.53]Here's some more bits, Jerma.
[320:10.59]Back to number one bit donator.
[320:12.96]Uh-oh.
[320:18.10]Uh-oh.
[320:20.20]Not quite.
[320:20.88]Not there anymore.
[320:21.74]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[320:23.78]Thank you so much, dude.
[320:25.79]It's not a... I hope you guys don't treat... Like, look, it is there.
[320:29.33]Twitch implemented a thing that shows the top three bit donators of the week, I think.
[320:36.71]I never wanted to really gamify giving me money.
[320:43.68]Twitch implemented it, and this is there.
[320:46.70]I'm not going to say, hey, that's fucking cool.
[320:51.41]Try to be number one BitDonator this week.
[320:54.33]I don't want to gamify it, but... Twitch is making everybody bit.
[321:00.41]I probably can turn it off.
[321:03.48]Maybe I can't.
[321:12.49]Twitch is giving everybody bit fever.
[321:15.85]No, but I mean, it's nice to have sometimes, though, because I can look over and see just who... Because if you click that down arrow, right?
[321:23.97]I can see everybody that pretty much has given bits more than, like, $5.
[321:28.07]And it's nice to just be able to see that information.
[321:30.75]Because that... I can't get that information where I am right here.
[321:36.31]I would have to, like, dig deep into Streamlabs to get that.
[321:41.49]But...
[321:43.89]Thank you.
[321:46.53]Appreciate it, Stormlord.
[321:48.43]Thanks for the massive amount of money you've given tonight.
[321:52.87]Also, thank you to Scripps3 for the $1.
[321:57.06]Do you like Rhode Island?
[321:58.20]I love Rhode Island.
[321:59.64]I love Newport, Rhode Island.
[322:00.92]Newport's awesome.
[322:02.96]I try to get to Newport at least like every year or two.
[322:07.31]It's fun just to drive down there and just eat at the restaurants and hang out.
[322:09.75]It's a nice place.
[322:11.91]There's like the crazy mansions.
[322:13.31]The breakers are in Newport.
[322:14.45]It's awesome.
[322:16.11]If you're from like the New England area, that's a nice trip.
[322:19.63]If you want like a nice trip, go to Newport.
[322:26.98]Especially during the summertime.
[322:27.98]It's beautiful.
[322:32.54]Hey, you're from Newport.
[322:33.82]Well, paper, you live in a nice place.
[322:37.12]It's a great little place.
[322:40.58]thank you to uh m4 oh my god well hold on a second like my brain cannot say your name emo I'm gonna call you m4 em4 thank you m4 for the one dollar my brother and I love watching your highlight videos and streams keep doing what you're doing I'm glad you can enjoy them in both places

[323:07.83]Appreciate it.
[323:08.93]Stick around.
[323:10.29]Hopefully.
[323:14.87]M4?
[323:15.11]No, not E-M4.
[323:18.39]E-M4, oh my god, yo.
[323:23.43]Thank you.
[323:24.27]Also, thank you to Anthony1215.
[323:25.15]What's up, Anthony?
[323:26.91]Thanks for the $1.
[323:28.79]I'm writing to inform you Charlie of the official podcast said he would like to have you on.
[323:33.41]If you go on, please announce Otto's Adventure 3.
[323:35.57]I've been waiting for five years.
[323:41.00]Maybe I'll send a tweet to somebody.
[323:42.22]We'll see.
[323:42.56]I told you guys I'm bad on podcasts, though.
[323:50.02]I get too weird.
[323:51.18]I get too fucking weird.
[323:52.22]I do.
[323:54.16]I'll hold it together.
[323:57.01]I'll be like Dexter.
[323:57.93]Maybe you don't like Dexter.
[323:58.83]He was just trying to be a human the whole show.
[324:00.91]I'll be fine.
[324:08.64]Do it.
[324:13.52]Yeah, I'll reach out and see what they have to say.
[324:16.70]Sounds like fun.
[324:19.25]But thank you to KXZ501.
[324:22.41]He gave $20 earlier.
[324:24.49]We talked about it briefly, but thank you, dude.
[324:28.34]That's money.
[324:30.83]Lots of it you've given.
[324:32.79]Thank you for the multiple amounts of money that you've given lots of.
[324:35.91]Appreciate it, dude.
[324:37.25]And then, of course, Cairo Toby gave $50 again.
[324:39.61]D-Sponge or Riot.
[324:41.27]We have somebody way better than D-Sponge at this point.
[324:44.37]He's pretty much a Sonic Sponge that's been sat on or run off with a car.
[324:49.06]But thank you, Cairo Toby.
[324:50.06]$50 fucking bucks.
[324:52.28]Thanks so much.
[324:55.20]Merkin Salesman, thanks for the $1.
[324:56.61]Appreciate that.
[324:57.61]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $5.
[325:00.41]The choice to make the rarest monsters in the game only accessible to Uma Thurman seems like a questionable design decision.
[325:07.39]But I'm not much of a game designer, so what do I know?
[325:11.56]Thank you for the $5, Moo.
[325:13.20]Appreciate it, man.
[325:15.74]Thank you to Clink180 for the $1.
[325:18.34]Hey, Jerma, you seem to have been really enjoying these Raise Your Monster style games.
[325:21.72]I absolutely am.
[325:23.26]I want to recommend Magic... Magic Pengel.
[325:28.44]Magic Pengel, the quest for color on the PlayStation 2.
[325:33.53]It's a game where you draw your monsters and power them by using more colors on them.
[325:39.47]It's got real quality cutscenes, and I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it.
[325:42.93]Cheers.
[325:43.27]I hope you're doing well after the power went out twice.
[325:45.39]Yeah.
[325:49.94]It would, uh...
[325:53.65]It was not fun.
[325:55.79]Because I don't do well in no power.
[325:59.09]But you do come to a realization that when there's no power, and there's no internet, you just, you start to realize just how attached we actually are to the technological world.
[326:12.51]I had nothing to do.
[326:15.87]Going outside, it was like snowing and shit.
[326:21.04]Even before, like the last time we lost power, it was... Huge wind and rain.
[326:26.17]It was awful outside.
[326:27.33]You didn't want to go outside.
[326:29.39]There's nothing you could do.
[326:31.98]You could read a book.
[326:33.14]That's it.
[326:35.86]Read a book.
[326:36.18]But yeah, but what books are out now?
[326:37.30]I don't want to read a book.
[326:40.91]All the books that are out now are like politics books.
[326:45.67]George R.R.
[326:46.37]Martin has taken like 30 years to write this next book that I want to read, The Winds of Winter.
[326:51.69]That shit ain't never going to come out.
[326:56.78]The only books that they sell at Barnes & Noble now are like Trump books.
[327:01.30]And like self-help how to be a good person book.
[327:06.47]I don't want to read any one of those.
[327:09.31]They don't even do good funnies anymore.
[327:19.47]To beat Trump.
[327:24.81]Just read the art of the deal over and over again.
[327:26.95]And see if I can sell my house.
[327:36.40]That's what I want to do.
[327:37.12]I want to read the art of the deal five times.
[327:39.65]And then see if I can personally sell my house without like a realtor.
[327:49.78]there are decent horror books there you know I'm obviously just kidding read the art of the deal on stream in the shitty trump voice the whole time I I got a feeling I don't know how that would go over with people I think that would piss off both sides badly right
[328:12.73]It's like, oh, he's like mocking Trump.
[328:14.53]Here come all the Trump supporters.
[328:16.43]Or he's like supporting reading this book that this guy wrote.
[328:21.63]I would lose everybody.
[328:29.08]You'd see everybody would just fuck.
[328:30.70]I would have nine viewers.
[328:37.36]I would never do something like that.
[328:40.44]Do it at EU times, so like... Nine strong.
[328:52.64]Nah, I'm just fucking around.
[328:56.54]Anywho.
[328:58.74]Let's keep going.
[329:04.30]Thank you to Garrett.
[329:06.10]Thank you, Garrett, for the $1.
[329:07.14]If you don't play JermaCraft right now, I'm going to cry.
[329:10.32]I didn't.
[329:11.02]It was five hours ago.
[329:12.04]I'm sorry I didn't.
[329:13.28]I hope you didn't cry.
[329:16.32]Thank you, Garrett, though.
[329:16.94]Appreciate it.
[329:18.74]Sky Cooper, thanks for the $1.
[329:20.80]They say something very bad.
[329:22.22]I'm going to say, I'm going to use the words that they said in a series of sentences, and then we'll go from there.
[329:29.09]You can decipher whatever it is.
[329:32.31]We'll give you like five sentences.
[329:38.08]I was at the grocery store, and I had to pick up a couple of items.
[329:42.08]One of those items happened to be my favorite planter's nuts.
[329:47.09]And then I had to go down to the next aisle, because, I mean, you know, it's gonna be snowing, gotta get some milk.
[329:54.25]That's it.
[329:55.01]That's what they wanted to say.
[329:57.61]Thank you, though.
[329:58.01]Thank you, Skye.
[329:58.51]Thank you, oh, no, Sly, not Skye.
[330:00.35]Thank you, Sly161, for the two bucks.
[330:03.95]Name a wall monster after me, please.
[330:11.37]uh I don't want to play with a wall monster but I guarantee you the next wall monster is going to be named sly 161. I guarantee it I promise it'll be named sly 161 the name if it's a wall monster it comes out gonna happen promise uh thank you to the milk master for the one dollar burn garfield's cart onto a disk and play it how would you even do that
[330:38.63]Thank you, Travel Boy, 22 for the $1.
[330:40.67]Hey, Jerma, sorry I can't donate much.
[330:42.03]I lost $800 in the crypto market.
[330:44.31]Don't be like me and put all your money in XRP.
[330:46.85]Bought $1,600 worth at 125.
[330:50.92]Now it's 70.
[330:51.68]Feels bad, man.
[330:52.48]How's your investment in the crypto market doing?
[330:56.32]Well, I would have told you you can't lose if you don't sell, right?
[331:05.56]Hey, you don't lose any money if you don't sell.
[331:12.97]but uh oh that sucks man the only thing I could tell you here's the only here's the one thing I could tell you by the way let me just paint a gigantic broad stroking picture I am not a financial advisor I don't claim to be do not take this as financial advice but the market is really is down right now if you went into something else
[331:36.49]had potential to bring that money back which the market is probably going to recover here within the next I would say six months or so I'm not a financial advisor this is not financial advice um it's still possible for that to come back ride it all the way to the bottom that's not I didn't say that I was reading chat I'm not a financial advisor this is not a financial advice
[332:04.38]Let's talk about top coins.
[332:08.05]How about Jerma's top five coins?
[332:11.93]I'm not doing this.
[332:13.77]No.
[332:14.59]You want to ask me this question for real?
[332:17.05]Like, you want to ask me crypto questions for real?
[332:19.15]Ask it in the Discord.
[332:20.05]I don't want to put it up here.
[332:21.73]This is like, let's go this different road.
[332:25.11]I don't want to go down.
[332:29.27]The quarter is the best coin.
[332:36.75]My coin... Yeah, I... I ain't doing this.
[332:40.14]I'll tell you for one reason why.
[332:42.32]Because, man, there's a lot of fucked up crypto shit where people throw out the name of a coin or a token and people buy the fuck out of it because somebody said to buy it and then, like, you turn into... Why the fuck did I... Somebody just dumped on us.
[332:55.58]I... No.
[332:56.93]I will... I'm not gonna say it.
[333:00.53]If you... Maybe in, like, the Discord in a less public space I could talk about something like that.
[333:11.53]Yeah, don't buy BitConnect.
[333:15.47]You can take that financial advice.
[333:17.37]That is financial advice.
[333:18.91]I am giving you financial advisement here.
[333:21.02]Don't do that.
[333:23.00]Absolutely don't.
[333:25.50]Insider trading.
[333:27.42]No, I ain't touching that with a 20-foot pole.
[333:30.56]No way.
[333:34.61]But we did get one of the funniest videos, like, of the last at least few years with the BitConnect guy.
[333:40.45]If you haven't seen it before, we'll get off of crypto after this, but like, go watch, just type in BitConnect guy.
[333:47.13]Just watch that whole video.
[333:50.59]It's just, the guy's a living meme at this point, like, there it is.
[333:58.45]But, uh, I'm really sorry to hear about that, Travelboy.
[334:01.81]That's a big hit.
[334:03.15]That sucks.
[334:06.13]The crypto market is very volatile.
[334:08.09]Just be careful.
[334:12.01]And hopefully you can either make that money back or you can make it work somewhere else, right?
[334:17.21]But thank you for the $1.
[334:20.19]Sawdust monies, thanks for the $0.75.
[334:21.73]We don't pay for your bad jokes.
[334:25.25]You just did.
[334:27.11]That was $0.75 that I got for a bad joke.
[334:29.99]Right?
[334:31.05]I probably said something really stupid and not funny and I got $0.75. $0.75.
[334:37.94]What am I doing with my hands?
[334:43.17]But thank you, Sawdust Bunnies.
[334:45.71]SuperSeal, thanks for the 25 cents.
[334:48.13]It just isn't a Jerma stream without technical difficulties.
[334:50.71]No, it never is.
[334:52.61]Unfortunately.
[334:55.27]Woozy10, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[334:56.98]Well, Woozy10.
[334:57.48]That's all they say.
[334:59.58]No, that's their name.
[335:00.32]They didn't say anything.
[335:00.88]Thanks for the $10, Woozy.
[335:01.76]Appreciate it.
[335:02.46]Thank you.
[335:04.81]Par Snips, thanks for the $1, so when are you gonna quit playing baby games and get to ones that matter like Orange Box?
[335:13.04]Baby- this is not a- this is a hardcore not baby game.
[335:18.90]Plus, I already played all the games in the Orange Box.
[335:21.46]There's only so many times you can play Portal before you say, this game is one of the best games ever.
[335:26.31]I already know what GLaDOS says tomorrow when I wake up in the chamber.
[335:32.96]That's a long time ago.
[335:33.92]Half-Life 2 is a great game.
[335:42.19]Orange Box really was probably the best video game ever, if you think about it.
[335:47.22]That was such an insane call- like think about- there will never be another Orange Box when you have inside of one box is like potentially three of the greatest video games on the PC that have come out in the last like two decades.
[336:06.44]That's insane.
[336:08.02]Just in regard- that's crazy.
[336:09.02]That'll never happen ever again.
[336:13.12]It was a bundle?
[336:13.80]Not yet, but it was still- it was 60 bucks, right?
[336:15.76]The Orange Box was only $60.
[336:18.59]It wasn't like 80 or 90 bucks.
[336:21.13]It was one product.
[336:28.33]God, remember when Valve was fucking incredible like seven years ago?
[336:35.35]I do.
[336:36.53]Thank you, Lewd Rat, for the $1.
[336:37.79]Appreciate it.
[336:38.63]Savior of the Dreaming Dead.
[336:40.98]Thanks for the $1.
[336:41.78]Kick him in the dish pan.
[336:45.92]Did I?
[336:46.16]I don't know.
[336:48.66]Thank you, Karn Concerto.
[336:53.04]Thank you, Karn Concerto, for the 1,000 bits.
[336:55.78]Thanks for the 10 bucks here.
[336:58.00]Hey, Jerma, I'm sick on my birthday, so all my plans are canceled.
[337:00.82]I'm sorry to hear that, dude.
[337:01.50]That sucks.
[337:03.24]I would normally be upset, but since you're streaming, everything's okay.
[337:07.49]Thanks for everything you do.
[337:08.29]I've been a huge fan for years.
[337:09.53]Please say hi to Otto for me.
[337:10.97]I will.
[337:12.69]Happy birthday, Con.
[337:15.10]Sorry that you're not feeling well.
[337:16.66]Sorry that you had to kind of cancel and fuck everything up because of your sickness here.
[337:21.00]But we'll all wish you, if you're still here, we're going to wish you all a happy birthday, Concerto.
[337:27.50]Hopefully you get some good shit.
[337:30.46]Thank you for the $10, dude.
[337:33.78]Glad to have you around.
[337:36.56]I'm just casual.
[337:37.34]Thanks for the $5.
[337:37.68]Kill it.
[337:38.84]It will eat you into bankruptcy.
[337:42.64]He was talking about, yeah, the thing we spent like three grand on that didn't go anywhere.
[337:45.80]It was terrible.
[337:46.78]Thank you, Casual, for the five bucks.
[337:50.14]Leon1071, thanks for the 25 cents.
[337:52.54]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thank you for the one dollar.
[337:59.24]This is my first time giving bits to your channel, Jerma985.
[338:02.87]This is the world-famous Garfield.

[338:22.53]Watch out, dude.
[338:24.13]Jim Davis does not like it when you say the word Garfield and don't put like a dollar in his tip jar.
[338:32.17]You better be careful.
[338:33.97]I hope you're the real Garfield.

[339:09.87]He's just running around still.
[339:15.37]He keeps just standing up and sprinting around with his big dumb legs.
[339:20.76]I didn't turn off the PlayStation.
[339:22.28]It's still on.
[339:26.72]Let's see what he's doing around the corner.

[341:42.65]Anyways, had a long day today, so thanks for the chill stream.
[341:45.65]Thank you VATS.
[341:47.61]Movies.
[341:49.39]Um.
[341:51.43]Is the Disaster Artist still in theaters?
[341:54.46]I want to see that really bad.
[341:55.64]Heard it was really good.
[341:57.38]So I would say go see that if it's still in theaters.
[341:59.00]And if not, then I don't know, the new Transformers movie's probably out.
[342:02.64]Isn't the Marvel, a new Marvel movie, the Infinity Land, whatever it's called.
[342:08.18]The guy with the fucking... Goofy Goomba guy.
[342:11.76]I wonder what his name is.
[342:12.76]Is it like Marvel?
[342:25.01]Hold on, what is it called?
[342:28.17]There's a new one coming out soon here.
[342:41.07]Avengers Infinity War.
[342:42.59]Infinity War.
[342:43.49]When did this come out?
[342:46.35]Avengers... Go see Infinity War in like three weeks.
[342:53.59]That's what I was thinking of.
[342:54.39]Or just go see the Disaster Artist.
[342:55.65]It's supposed to be really good.
[342:58.91]Thank you, though.
[342:59.27]Appreciate it.
[343:00.79]Thank you also to MooMeansMoo for the $1, BumbaGumba and FrumpusGimp, two best friends that talk about shrimping
[343:12.54]What are you saying?
[343:16.76]Oh, it's a Forrest Gump reference.
[343:18.84]Okay.
[343:20.80]Is it Forrest Gump?
[343:22.74]Am I saying his name right?
[343:24.81]Forrest Gump.
[343:25.45]Yeah, okay.
[343:28.31]Thank you, KXZ, again, for the $50 beanbag hype.
[343:34.01]KXZ, he's also given $70 fucking dollars.
[343:38.17]So, thank you, KXZ.
[343:41.13]for your large contribution.
[343:43.81]Contribution?
[343:44.81]God.

[343:57.44]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[343:58.30]Come to Georgia, dad.
[343:59.38]You know, I might go to Georgia because I heard they got some fucking great
[344:17.92]Peanuts.
[344:18.64]Pecans and peaches.
[344:21.38]All three peas.
[344:22.52]Down in Georgia.
[344:25.74]Heard they got some great peanuts.
[344:28.08]I would love to... R.L.
[344:29.00]Stine is still up in my search.
[344:31.96]Thank you.
[344:32.22]Appreciate it.
[344:41.26]Thanks to...
[344:45.93]I'm so glad it does.
[344:46.41]I'm so happy that it does.
[344:47.01]Over the years of making YouTube videos and all the time I've been streaming lately,
[345:13.33]It makes me so happy that anybody can- that- that thinks it's fun or that cares about it.
[345:18.72]There's like 800, almost a thousand or so videos now that you can just watch.
[345:23.88]That it- it humbles me and brings me, grounds me so much to know that like people fucking watch old videos of mine.
[345:30.70]That potentially are years old.
[345:34.94]Thank you.
[345:37.94]So much.
[345:39.60]I'm glad you can continue to enjoy the videos and all the stuff.
[345:43.91]I hope it's still fun.
[345:46.93]I hope so.
[345:47.53]That's what I try to do.
[345:49.96]This is like seven years later.
[345:51.90]Hopefully you guys are still having a good time.
[345:53.86]Because that's all I care about.
[345:56.16]Thank you, Dubski.
[345:56.74]Appreciate it, man.
[345:58.74]Travelboy22, thanks for the 40 cents.
[346:01.06]Well, I guess I'm riding XRP all the way to the bottom then, since you're an official financial advisor that I use as my main source of information.
[346:09.87]No.
[346:11.39]Do not do that.
[346:16.69]god not I let me be I'm gonna be very concrete here in quotes Jerma985 on stream in direct quotes I'm not you're not gonna be able to decipher pick apart this one quote me saying this now it is 108
[346:39.97]1.09 a.m.
[346:41.57]Friday the 16th, March 2018.
[346:43.89]This is me, Jerma985, talking.
[346:47.76]I am not a financial advisor.
[346:50.40]Nothing I say.
[346:51.46]Don't ever listen to a word I say.
[346:54.66]Period.
[346:55.95]Quotation mark.
[346:57.33]End.
[346:59.09]Send the email.
[347:05.00]Invest $109 in AM.
[347:08.46]He's in character.
[347:09.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[347:11.26]It's a bit.
[347:16.00]No, I didn't mean not a whole word I say.
[347:17.80]I mean like the string of words that I previously said.
[347:22.73]Oh, he's doing a character.
[347:25.37]That wasn't in quotes, so sorry.
[347:29.91]Harmony, of course, thanks for the $1.
[347:31.65]Question mark.
[347:37.72]That'd be funny to do one day.
[347:48.11]Just sit there and read a whole book in one sitting.
[347:50.63]It would have to be something really small.
[347:53.47]How big are the Animorphs books?
[347:55.65]You know the books that are on the shelf at Barnes & Noble or Borders or whatever bookstore?
[348:01.08]And they're
[348:03.62]No one will ever buy them.
[348:05.53]It's some random shitty adventure book.
[348:08.87]And the dude's written like 70 of them.
[348:11.09]And they're like 118 pages long.
[348:14.89]You know what?
[348:17.01]Yeah.
[348:19.37]I'm gonna do that at some point soon.
[348:20.87]I'm gonna get like an 100 page dumb shitty adventure book off the shelf at Barnes & Noble.
[348:24.37]I'm gonna read the whole thing on stream.
[348:25.43]For a whole stream.
[348:27.37]Oh my god.
[348:30.20]KXZ just gave it another 50 fucking dollars right now.
[348:36.42]That's $120 total for you, man.
[348:40.95]And you say, the financial advice is great and all, but for real, when is the next rat movie, Kappa?
[348:57.82]Sorry, here's the thing.
[348:59.46]Thank you so much for the 120 bucks.
[349:02.41]You're a monetary legend at this point today.
[349:06.53]Thank you, dude.
[349:09.37]Let me go over something about video making.
[349:11.75]Especially something like Rat Movie, right?
[349:14.58]Contrary to maybe popular belief, Rat Movie 2 took me like three straight weeks to make.
[349:23.66]Of like working on it like maybe six hours a day, every day.
[349:28.44]Like, if I, let's just say, streaming, if I stream like three or four times a week, I like, I can't like make, Rat Movie 3 will take like six months to make.
[349:37.97]You know what I mean?
[349:42.13]Contrary to how terrible those were, the software is so old, it took like fucking at least a couple weeks to make that.
[349:54.13]Trying to like painstakingly animate in those programs
[349:59.08]Just outsource it.
[349:59.92]No!
[350:00.36]I, no.
[350:00.92]I have to make it.
[350:03.10]That's, I can't, I don't, I don't outsource.
[350:04.48]It has to be, I have to make it.
[350:08.50]I even have a new song ready.
[350:10.39]I have a new song.
[350:12.09]It's done.
[350:14.57]I would love to say it for you right now, but I'm not gonna.
[350:16.91]There is a Rat Movie 3 song that's already done.
[350:20.43]And damn is it catchy.
[350:21.92]It's, it's fucking catchy as hell.
[350:28.57]It's the best one of all.
[350:29.73]Better than the first two.
[350:32.01]Better than the original song.
[350:33.27]Better than the second... The remix song.
[350:35.53]Oh, it's better than both of them combined.
[350:36.77]Oh god, he's snapping.
[350:42.89]No, you can't have a five second demo because I don't... No leaks.
[350:49.94]No leakers.
[350:51.22]You know, I'm not a leaker.
[350:57.25]There's a lot of shit, man.
[350:59.29]Let's be candidly here.
[351:02.61]Shit moves so slowly when you want to do things.
[351:07.06]You wouldn't believe how slow the real world moves.
[351:13.76]I've been going back and forth.
[351:15.88]He's been on stream before.
[351:16.78]You've seen him.
[351:18.18]I'm going to call him Wine Guy.
[351:21.20]He's the guy that I work with on every project.
[351:24.27]We work on everything together.
[351:26.49]Man, the snail's pace that the real world works at is mind-boggling.
[351:32.63]We've been kind of going back and forth, email and calls, and, well, you gotta talk to this person.
[351:40.76]Now you gotta talk to this person.
[351:42.32]We're just trying to get fucking shit done.
[351:43.67]We're trying to get, like, videos and shit done.
[351:47.73]Everyone moves at such a snail's pace.
[351:55.92]But there are a lot of things that will eventually be seen.
[352:03.32]I wish I could just speed it up.
[352:04.98]But I can't.
[352:13.31]But you will see something.
[352:14.95]Very, very interesting.
[352:16.89]As soon as I can get it to happen.
[352:20.93]Sluggish.
[352:22.49]Flow.
[352:26.18]If you want it done right, you've got to outsource it.
[352:28.00]Not true.
[352:32.62]Anyways, we only have a few more to do.
[352:34.36]There's only a few more bits here.
[352:37.54]Thank you to Galaxia for the $2.
[352:41.27]Google recently decided to start banning cryptocurrency ads, so we might see a fall in the market and hopefully mining.
[352:47.05]You're also not going to see this guy's face anymore.
[352:50.93]Let me see if I can find it.
[352:52.87]Like, that guy with the beard that's like, what's the next Bitcoin?
[352:57.69]Like, I'm good.
[352:58.39]I don't want to see that fucking guy's face anymore.
[353:01.35]Crypto genius gives you secrets to make a trillion dollars.
[353:04.14]Like, I don't want to see that anymore.
[353:05.18]People are still dabbing.
[353:16.10]And it's weird.
[353:16.65]It's a weird, like, emote zoom in on the guy's mouth and shit.
[353:19.65]Like, why?
[353:20.45]Like, hold on.
[353:21.95]Let's look at it.
[353:28.54]Let me pull it up on stream.
[353:30.49]There he is.
[353:31.11]There he is.
[353:36.83]I just clicked it.
[353:37.85]You got it from me.
[353:40.05]Yeah, you got it from me.
[353:45.97]Let's put it on screen.
[353:47.06]I actually just went to the page where the ad actually takes you.
[353:57.48]Where did that even save to?
[353:58.44]I need more fucking viruses.
[354:03.67]Actually, the name of this image is Crypto Genius, by the way.
[354:10.49]Yeah, there's a couple of them.
[354:19.45]Alright, how many of you guys have seen this image somewhere on the internet?
[354:30.72]This is no longer allowed anymore.
[354:34.02]See, I'll put it in places where it's supposed to be.
[354:38.27]There, it'd be like here.
[354:40.21]It'd be like over here.
[354:41.27]It'd be like this.
[354:43.13]Like that.
[354:44.69]Like there.
[354:48.31]I'm sick of seeing this guy's face.
[354:49.85]I don't care.
[354:50.33]It looks like Bill Gates and Gabe Newell melded together and got hit by a car.
[355:09.23]Like, in the middle of, like, a transformation.
[355:11.05]I don't even know who the fuck that guy is.
[355:23.18]Yes, that's- that's Gabe Newell and- and- that's okay.
[355:25.96]That's Gabe Newell, Andy Samberg, and Bill Gates.
[355:29.96]All fell into, like, a fusion well.
[355:32.50]And that guy, like, crawled out and was like,
[355:35.74]I've been down here for 10 years, and boy do I have some secrets on crypto currencies!
[355:50.27]He's probably a nice guy, you know?
[355:52.57]He's probably not a bad guy.
[355:53.57]Oh shit.
[356:00.95]Boy, are my arms tired.
[356:05.14]Oh, Kyra Toby just gave another $100.
[356:10.46]That's $150 fucking dollars.
[356:13.21]That's a stack of money tonight.
[356:16.67]Thank you, Kyra.
[356:18.63]Jerma memes aside, thanks so much for the entertaining stream.
[356:22.15]I've had a terrible week, but I've laughed so hard tonight that I don't really know what to say, so thank you.
[356:26.89]Hope you know that you've been a positive influence on people's lives.
[356:29.01]Anyway, Jerma BBs.
[356:30.93]When?
[356:31.39]Dab.
[356:36.07]Thank you.
[356:39.22]As long as, look, when we have fun, it's great.
[356:43.10]I love having fun.
[356:45.54]Dicking around, making fun of video games, having fun in video games, making fun of crypto geniuses, you know.
[356:54.81]No, no, no, no.
[356:56.23]No jokes aside.
[356:56.77]You said no memes aside, no jokes aside.
[357:01.34]But I love this shit.
[357:05.77]I love just dicking around and hanging out with you guys and having you guys- even you guys say things that I'm- might be a little mean to me.
[357:13.53]You know?
[357:13.87]A little- they were very mean to me.
[357:16.07]This chat.
[357:16.88]Once.
[357:19.52]No, you guys are fucking awesome.
[357:21.32]I wouldn't have it any other way.
[357:24.00]You guys are fucking incredible.
[357:28.24]But thank you so much, Cairo.
[357:32.12]You've been very mean to me before.
[357:35.46]We are literally just text boxes.
[357:37.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[357:38.87]You're a guy.
[357:40.45]Goosey.
[357:41.39]Goosey, you are a guy or a girl sitting at your computer.
[357:44.93]You're not just a text box.
[357:46.05]You're a person that just wrote that.
[357:50.36]Don't sell yourself short.
[357:53.54]Don't keep yourself in the box.
[357:54.52]Get out of that box.
[357:56.68]Get out of the Twitch box, you know?
[357:58.28]You're a person in there.
[358:04.84]But thank you so much, everybody, for even watching in the first place.
[358:07.75]You guys are fucking incredible.
[358:09.51]And to the people that continue to pay me exorbitant amounts of money to do this is sometimes hard to come up with a response.
[358:22.02]But thank you.
[358:25.40]KXZ gave another $11 here.
[358:28.62]You thought that was the last, but it was actually me.
[358:33.89]Dio.
[358:35.72]Thought that was the last of it.
[358:38.70]These guys with the fucking stacks of cash.
[358:43.22]We're all humans.
[358:43.88]Here we are.
[358:46.25]But thank you, KXC.
[358:47.11]Thank you, Kairotobi.
[358:48.03]Thank you, Stormlord.
[358:50.33]Everybody that gave a bunch of bits.
[358:54.43]You guys are fucking awesome.
[358:56.85]Only one or two more here.
[358:58.02]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer again.
[359:01.38]Garfield's back after 35 cents.
[359:03.90]Thanks, Garfield.
[359:05.32]Jeremy, thank you so much for all the content you've created over the years.
[359:07.22]If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have gotten into voice acting and just gotten hired for a musical.
[359:12.10]Holy shit.
[359:15.10]Congratulations on that, first of all, dude.
[359:16.56]Thanks to you, I've become a more positive individual.
[359:19.70]You're an inspiration to all of us, and I can't thank you enough.
[359:21.59]Mondays still suck, though, but hey.
[359:23.69]Another day, another lasagna.
[359:26.29]P.S.
[359:27.29]Throw Nermal off the table for me.
[359:33.98]Uh, I don't, was that on my table?
[359:36.41]This, this thing?
[359:37.97]This thing?
[359:38.39]It's gone.
[359:43.63]Thank you, though.
[359:44.27]Thank you, Joker Goat, for the two dollars.
[359:47.38]Joker Goat, thank you.
[359:48.20]Hey, Jerma, I've legit been watching you since your earliest days.
[359:50.86]You've helped me through some tough times, and you literally saved my life twice.
[359:55.74]There was nothing more I could ask for.
[359:57.08]I owe you literally everything.
[359:58.74]You're a goddamn blessing.
[360:00.15]Love you so fucking much.
[360:01.17]I will treasure you forever.
[360:02.13]Same goes for Chad.
[360:04.88]But we treasure you, Joker.
[360:10.80]Anybody that... Give a little perspective, right?
[360:14.72]To you guys from my side of the table here.
[360:18.11]After we got rid of that thing that the guy wanted me to throw off.
[360:25.01]When I started doing videos and stuff,
[360:31.12]I had this, like, grand plan and this grand scheme in my brain.
[360:37.14]Oh, wouldn't it be awesome to have, like, anybody even watch my videos?
[360:40.44]Oh, if I could get to, like, ten viewers, holy shit, that's so many people.
[360:43.93]When I had, like, a hundred subscribers on YouTube, it was, like, that was a huge fucking deal.
[360:49.29]And the more that, like, that channel grew, the more that, like, I've moved over to Twitch pretty much at this point, right?
[360:56.41]It's always just, it's remarkable to me that there are people that will say that to me.
[361:05.43]I almost can't even believe it.
[361:07.36]Honestly.
[361:10.14]When I was sitting there making like engineer century videos to like 30 people, I never even dreamed, this is like something, you guys are fulfilling my wildest fucking dreams right now.
[361:21.05]I hope you guys like really understand that.
[361:27.79]So as much as you're saying that, you know, you've helped me so much and thank you for all the videos and all that stuff, you guys have helped me fucking achieve things I never even could possibly imagine were possible.
[361:42.59]So you have to accept me saying that as well.
[361:45.66]Thank you for changing my fucking life.
[361:47.78]Because you have.
[361:55.63]Shit was a lot different for me less than 7 or 8 years ago here.
[362:00.76]I've talked about it a few times, right?
[362:07.30]I wish there was more I could say or do.
[362:10.86]We have these... You know, after the stream we just kinda hang out and... I hear some of your stories, some of the things you guys are going through, some of the... The problems, the triumphs, the... The victories, the sadness, like it doesn't... We're all fucking humans.
[362:24.79]You know?
[362:25.93]Just a couple of them.
[362:26.63]A couple of humans.
[362:31.31]But I just don't... I never take you guys for granted.
[362:33.56]I just hope you really know that.
[362:38.72]Thank you, everybody.
[362:46.64]Two thumbs up.
[362:51.18]But with that, I think that is going to wrap it up here.
[362:55.68]We got one more from MooMeansMoo.
[362:57.08]Thanks for the $1.
[362:57.84]I'm upset that you didn't consult me for musical assistance, but I will forgive you if you finally remember to play the P song.
[363:03.86]I was going to put it... No electricity!
[363:08.74]I haven't had electricity!
[363:11.62]If I had electricity, I would have put the P song on.
[363:14.50]Didn't have electricity, god darn it!
[363:17.54]Thank you, Moo.
[363:19.00]It'll be there tomorrow night.
[363:20.36]Because now I can use the computer for more than an hour or two without it crashing and dying and... Speaking of crashing and dying... My car!
[363:27.69]I crashed into!
[363:30.17]By a plow!
[363:32.69]More excuses!
[363:35.27]But that's going to be it.
[363:36.57]The final bit that came in here, well, two actually came in.
[363:39.89]MooMeansMoo again, thanks for $5.
[363:41.45]Bill Gates stars in a brand new adaptation of Davin Cronenberg's classic, The Fly, in this summer's upcoming smash hit, The Newell.
[363:48.81]Bill Gates stars as scientist Bill Science, who has been experimenting with teleportation technology.
[363:53.89]Unfortunately for him, during one of his experiments, he did not notice the Gabe Newell that entered the teleportation pod with him.
[364:00.12]Watch as he develops...
[364:02.24]and mutates and develops a love of card games and VR coming summer 2018.
[364:09.19]Thank you, Leventation, for the 10 bucks.
[364:12.81]Damn it, this has been such an enjoyable past 30 minutes.
[364:15.59]This is my favorite part of the stream.
[364:16.75]Thank you for what you do.
[364:18.39]Thank you for doing what you do, Jerma.
[364:19.93]Thank you, Leventation.
[364:23.34]I've come to really enjoy this last hour or so, like 30 minutes to an hour at the end of the stream.
[364:33.32]I've struggled with a lot of this over the last six months or so with how to read bits and subs and I'm not really good at it.
[364:43.33]I miss a lot of shit and there was a lot of problems with it when I was trying to do it in real time.
[364:48.25]But I like this just us hanging out and talking for like an hour or so after the stream.
[364:57.67]I need a wrap up scream.
[364:59.94]Yeah, you know, maybe it would be better to have, like, another screen here that was just, like, maybe him, like, sipping the jay there.
[365:08.91]Maybe him, like, sipping a cup of coffee or something.
[365:13.03]Like, dozing off.
[365:15.41]Maybe we'll do that.
[365:16.67]Because this is actually, yeah, this is like the stream is over screen, right?
[365:23.55]But I will see you guys tomorrow.
[365:25.08]Same time.
[365:26.97]We will continue Monster Rancher 2.
[365:29.80]Beanbag Sonic's adventure continues.
[365:34.36]See you tomorrow night.
[365:35.30]Much love.
[365:36.76]Have a good rest of your evening.
[365:38.18]It's probably really late for a lot of you guys.
[365:41.67]Take care.
[365:42.67]See you tomorrow.
[365:56.57]you
