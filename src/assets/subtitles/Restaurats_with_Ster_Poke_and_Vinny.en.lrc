[ve:60.16.100]

[00:40.85]Hello?
[00:41.33]Hello?
[00:44.61]How are you?
[00:47.58]It's been a while.
[00:51.96]It's been a little bit, hasn't it?
[00:54.67]It's been almost a full month since the last time you saw me.
[01:00.55]Eh, it is what it is.
[01:03.73]I'm back today.
[01:06.53]Got some fun stuff planned with the boys.
[01:13.08]Yeah, happy Thanksgiving.
[01:14.37]It was yesterday, but, you know, happy Thanksgiving.
[01:30.45]Where we got games to play.
[01:34.45]We're gonna play this rat game.
[01:35.82]It's called Restor Rats.
[01:38.75]We might play that RV game that came out.
[01:41.97]It's a driving game, so you know of course we're gonna play it.
[01:50.51]You see Power Wash Sim 2?
[01:52.22]Yep.
[01:54.62]I don't know if I'm gonna play it though.
[02:03.51]I'm not sure.
[02:08.70]Did you stuff any turkey?
[02:13.09]I had a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner, which I'm sure I'll tell you about.
[02:25.61]That was last month?
[02:27.36]No, Halloween was last month.
[02:32.04]But yeah, what's up?
[02:33.47]I think everybody's gonna be...
[02:36.14]I think everyone just went live, or I think Vinny just went live.
[02:38.45]I think, is Ster live?
[02:39.54]Is Polk live?
[02:42.61]I haven't even checked.
[02:44.68]I just pressed my button.
[02:46.33]I don't know about anybody else what anyone else has going on.
[02:50.93]Did you stick the wishbone up your ass?
[02:55.85]You know, it's actually interesting that a way to get me to read a comment is to just put... it doesn't even matter what the first part of the sentence is.
[03:04.68]It could just be like something up your ass and I'll probably just read it.
[03:10.08]Which is annoying because it makes more of you do it.
[03:14.25]I feel like if you took every comment I've ever read, I would say probably a third of them are like, hey, dude, you're going to put that thing in your ass?
[03:23.22]And I go, I'm going to put that thing in my ass.
[03:24.91]I read it just like that.
[03:28.93]A third of them?
[03:29.86]Well, maybe that's a lot.
[03:31.01]Maybe like 2%.
[03:32.26]Is 2% still a lot?
[03:44.17]Did you cook on Thanksgiving?
[03:46.18]We'll talk about Thanksgiving a little later.
[03:48.89]Because it's important.
[03:53.45]You said you're gonna leak that video of you farting and saying Aaron.
[03:57.91]Yeah, I've said a lot of dumb shit on this stream.
[04:13.66]Watch any good movies?
[04:16.00]Not really.
[04:27.87]You get a haircut?
[04:28.58]I actually did not get a haircut yet.
[04:31.01]And I did say yet, because it is gonna happen.
[04:39.18]Did you see Wicked 2?
[04:41.04]I didn't see Wicked 1.
[04:44.65]I'll tell you what I did do, though.
[04:46.06]I saw that Wizard of Oz at the sphere.
[04:49.49]I don't know about that one.
[04:51.09]I don't know about that one.
[04:52.72]I don't know about that one.
[04:59.06]Okay, The Wizard of Oz is a movie that I grew up on, right?
[05:02.48]I've seen that movie dozens of times.
[05:05.03]Obviously classic American cinema, right?
[05:08.34]watching it at the sphere is I don't okay if you don't want to get that spoiled if you're going to go on vacation at some point and you're going on vacation to go see the sphere wizard of oz
[05:18.04]Just come back in like 10 minutes.
[05:24.89]That, okay, you ready?
[05:27.60]The first ten minutes of that experience, is they just put you on a fucking rollercoaster.
[05:35.34]It's explosions.
[05:37.56]It's like, Anaheim, look out!
[05:41.12]It's literally like, they shake the seats.
[05:46.19]It is insane what they do in the first- they spray you with water and shit like flying around in the theater.
[05:53.80]And then it gets to the actual kind of movie, and it's a weird condensed version of the movie.
[06:00.00]The stuff is just kind of cut out.
[06:01.81]It's kind of the whole movie, but it's not...
[06:04.65]I kind of feel like I was watching the movie in YouTube shorts.
[06:07.06]It was like, wait... Oh, this is like a...
[06:09.51]It's like 60 something minutes.
[06:11.92]They removed like 30, 40 minutes of footage or something.
[06:17.37]And the sides of the screen, because the sphere is so huge, the sides of the screen
[06:22.55]are all I think it's like out painted or they did some computer generated ai generate whatever it is
[06:29.27]And it's kind of weird because there's actors that are kind of standing, waiting to be filled in.
[06:35.15]They're kind of like weirdly pixelated in the sides of the sphere.
[06:39.24]And when the camera gets to the right spot, they kind of like spawn into the right place in a weird way.
[06:47.06]But that's not even the part that I thought was just kind of dumb.
[06:52.33]The wizard in the Wizard of Oz sphere experience
[06:57.35]is, I'm gonna have to tell you, it's fucking dog shit.
[07:01.76]I hated it.
[07:03.26]It is a weird, like 150 FPS, like super smooth CG guy's face.
[07:11.78]And if they make him like an alien, it's...
[07:15.81]I did not like it at all.
[07:17.58]I hated it.
[07:19.77]Now...
[07:21.46]the first 10 minute roller coaster, if they just made a roller coaster Wizard of Oz experience, if that was the ride,
[07:26.98]It was like, hey, we got this Wizard of Oz ride and it's the part where the fucking tornado comes in.
[07:31.30]It's like a seven minute experience.
[07:32.44]It's literally at like Universal Studios or whatever, right?
[07:36.79]Okay, like, I get in the rollercoaster, and it's like, oh, fuck, this is crazy!
[07:43.69]but watching the whole movie in a condensed way, I don't know, it was weird.
[07:52.36]It was like a Marvel of LED technology, okay?
[07:57.73]But that would be the quote that they would take and put in quotes for my review.
[08:02.00]Do you know what I'm saying?
[08:02.77]What I just said.
[08:04.39]Oh, Jerma985 says, it's a Marvel of modern LED technology.
[08:08.62]And it's like, oh, fuck, he must have loved it.
[08:15.75]But it's, you know what I think is crazy about that experience?
[08:19.51]And wait, I'm talking for way too long.
[08:21.96]I'm supposed to be hanging out with friends right now.
[08:23.73]Is anybody ready?
[08:25.30]I'm just talking about the Wizard of Oz thing.
[08:28.72]Okay.
[08:30.70]Here's what I will say to end this.
[08:33.82]The original Wizard of Oz, I remember watching it on a little...
[08:38.58]half TV, half VCR, and it was recorded from a TV showing of the movie.
[08:47.02]So I've recorded on a VCR, so it was like a... And this screen was probably 14 inches as big.
[08:53.35]It was a 4.3 screen.
[08:54.59]CRT.
[08:56.39]The amount of times that they've upscaled and re-rendered this and upscaled it and re-rendered it, it's like, how the fuck is it even on here?
[09:06.19]It's like that used to be on a tiny little screen at a CRT with tubes in it.
[09:12.01]And now I'm looking left and right and it's like, wow, I can see the whole farm.
[09:17.01]It's weird, man.
[09:18.84]It's weird.
[09:21.51]They scanned the original negative at like 12k.
[09:24.69]And that's the thing about film, which is interesting, right?
[09:28.09]Film...
[09:30.02]Is this wrong for me to say this?
[09:31.30]Film can do...
[09:33.47]They can...
[09:34.17]If you shoot something on film, you can kind of...
[09:37.65]It's like voxel art, right?
[09:40.40]You can kind of make it bigger.
[09:43.30]It's like 4K, yeah.
[09:50.67]Vector art, not voxel art.
[09:53.82]Well, whatever, you know what I'm talking about.
[09:57.11]Voxel art's the shit that they made Cube World out of.
[10:01.51]That game?
[10:02.11]Is that what that was?
[10:03.58]Alright, anyways.
[10:08.11]I saw The Wizard of Oz.
[10:09.94]in the sphere, and it was like, I was like, holy shit, this is crazy, I don't know if I like this, whoa, shit's flying around, this is, I don't know.
[10:18.84]My, okay, my body thought that was a really cool experience, but my brain, hey, hey, my brain, you know,
[10:28.52]If I only had a brain, didn't really love it, my heart thought it was
[10:33.54]Very interesting.
[10:34.76]My courage was tested.
[10:36.49]Just shut the fuck up, and I'm going to call the boys.
[10:47.95]Hey, how's it going?
[10:50.04]Yo, what is up?
[10:52.80]How are you?
[10:54.43]oh man dude I haven't seen you in like man we haven't played games in a long time what the hell was that
[11:02.86]Oh, that was me.
[11:04.85]Oh, that was you.
[11:05.52]Alright, Holly.
[11:06.06]Everybody's audio is crazy right now.
[11:08.69]I got to turn you down.
[11:09.73]I got to turn you up.
[11:12.60]Sorry.
[11:14.51]I hope it's not.
[11:15.94]Give me this.
[11:17.17]Give me this shit.
[11:17.91]I hope you're doing okay.
[11:18.76]I hope you're alright.
[11:20.85]I'm going to turn you back up again.
[11:22.18]Vinny was doing his intro, right?
[11:27.06]I think so.
[11:27.30]I think he's just going now.
[11:32.90]Hello!
[11:33.49]How have you guys been?
[11:35.34]How have you guys been?
[11:37.40]Good!
[11:37.62]Yo!
[11:39.47]Yo.
[11:39.89]Been good.
[11:41.45]Sick.
[11:42.58]This is the best part when you have, when you don't talk to somebody for a month, you all kind of just go, how you been?
[11:46.69]Good.
[11:47.07]I'm dude.
[11:47.47]How you been?
[11:47.83]We're doing good.
[11:48.33]Good.
[11:48.55]Well, did you guys, did you?
[11:49.46]Did you guys just talk?
[11:51.26]Yeah.
[11:51.68]Kind of?
[11:52.50]Yeah.
[11:52.64]We're not all in the same room.
[11:54.61]Folks, since the last time we talked to you, you have played 300 hours of our creators.
[11:59.04]Yeah, I've changed.
[12:01.21]Yeah, dude, how... Like, a lot has changed.
[12:03.60]Okay, could you give a one-sentence review?
[12:07.72]On Ark Raiders.
[12:10.33]I think it's great.
[12:13.15]Okay.
[12:13.27]That's a pretty good review.
[12:16.05]Great.
[12:16.35]Don't shoot.
[12:17.52]I don't know.
[12:19.23]Great game.
[12:19.65]You didn't even save too much water.
[12:22.32]You got to try it, Jerma.
[12:23.90]Uh, I did.
[12:26.01]I played one round.
[12:28.00]This is just on my couch, by the way.
[12:31.00]And where else would it be?
[12:33.15]That's true.
[12:33.91]Well, I just I kind of I don't know.
[12:35.86]I just can't do it.
[12:37.57]It's too straight.
[12:38.11]It's like three different games in my brain.
[12:40.84]Yeah, it's scary.
[12:41.96]It's collect the loot, but it's also look out.
[12:44.53]Is that guy going to shoot you?
[12:45.84]Is that person friendly?
[12:46.96]Why don't you go find out and go be like, hello, stranger, and then you're just on the ground?
[12:50.83]Did you talk to anybody in the game?
[12:51.95]Did you say, don't shoot?
[12:52.98]And they shot you?
[12:54.24]I did do, like, the emotes, yeah.
[12:56.51]I also did the, like, hey, let's dance, man.
[12:58.36]Like, who cares?
[12:59.00]Let's have some fun.
[13:01.18]I actually do love how they do that.
[13:02.66]I love how it could just be a dance emote, but they have to add a, hey, what's that?
[13:07.48]Let's dance.
[13:08.37]They have to do it like, it sounds like that too.
[13:11.32]yeah yeah he's not wrong I'll give that like a letter grade for it for that
[13:19.08]Are we saying too much right now without Vinny?
[13:20.83]Should we pause?
[13:22.19]We can pause.
[13:22.59]Do you guys want to pause?
[13:23.87]Let's not talk to Vinny, actually.
[13:26.30]Hey.
[13:27.21]Let's say as much as we can before he gets here and then be really quiet when he does.
[13:31.77]Oh, we'd just be like, oh, we talked about that.
[13:33.24]Oh, yeah.
[13:33.72]Should we say it again?
[13:34.96]Yeah.
[13:35.81]Yeah.
[13:37.64]But yeah, I've...
[13:40.53]There he is!
[13:42.74]Hey, guys.
[13:48.00]Hey, what's up, man?
[13:48.77]How you been?
[13:50.47]been good.
[13:50.97]How are you?
[13:51.75]It's crazy.
[13:52.47]Like the last time you talked to poke, he hadn't played like 300 hours of art graders.
[13:57.69]He was just beginning his 300 hour journey.
[14:00.02]yeah did battlefields also become a thing for you guys or let's dance
[14:08.91]I have not played...
[14:10.82]Okay.
[14:12.99]I can't remember the last time I got a kill in a first-person shooter.
[14:18.29]I don't remember what the last one time it was.
[14:20.04]I don't know.
[14:20.54]TF2.
[14:21.36]It's definitely TF2.
[14:23.01]I don't know.
[14:24.96]Yeah.
[14:26.20]Yeah, he's like not good at them.
[14:29.52]No, it wasn't TF2.
[14:30.54]It was probably like a... No, what was the last multiplayer peak?
[14:34.33]Remember peak?
[14:36.14]Yeah, but that's not like a first person.
[14:40.10]He sucks.
[14:41.07]What do you mean?
[14:41.67]I haven't played a first-person shooter.
[14:42.94]I can't suck at a game if I don't play it.
[14:47.44]Ster, is your profile picture Ghost from Call of Duty series?
[14:51.64]Uh, no, I drew that.
[14:53.49]Okay, never mind, sorry.
[14:55.28]Just the skull guy.
[14:58.44]Yeah, sorry.
[15:00.03]Alright.
[15:00.35]I'm a little disappointed.
[15:02.01]He just called your he called your art cod, bro.
[15:04.58]That's crazy.
[15:05.23]He compared my art to, like, the AI slop.
[15:10.23]That's crazy.
[15:10.97]Bro is a skull face man.
[15:12.38]I don't know.
[15:14.10]It's Seymour Butts.
[15:16.15]Did you guys have a good Thanksgiving?
[15:18.71]Sorry, Jermo, go ahead.
[15:19.90]No, wait, we had a great Thanksgiving.
[15:21.56]You should know.
[15:23.85]I know.
[15:24.28]Well, we'll get to that.
[15:26.96]We'll get to that.
[15:30.37]Anyways, can I talk about Thanksgiving yet?
[15:33.46]Or are we gonna do that?
[15:34.36]No later?
[15:35.49]Can I tell you can I say?
[15:37.45]Listen, people in... Vinny, you're 40, I'm 40, and I just saw this a few times, and it's annoying, and I have to bring it up.
[15:44.90]People say, oh my God, dude, you suck at games, dude.
[15:47.87]You suck.
[15:48.27]How are you so bad?
[15:49.94]It's like, listen.
[15:51.09]if if you tell a 25 year old javelin thrower that was at the olympics and they throw a fucking javelin like 9 000 feet or whatever it is
[15:59.73]And they break a record.
[16:00.81]And then when they're 40, you go up and they can only throw it like 2,500 meters or whatever.
[16:06.70]It's like, wow, dude, you suck now.
[16:09.65]Like, well, yeah, so what?
[16:11.24]I got a little older.
[16:12.02]You're on a curve.
[16:13.49]Yeah.
[16:17.50]So, like, yeah, you're not gonna be able to perform the way you could perform, you know, 20 years ago when you were at your peak, prime brain and body.
[16:26.88]Yeah.
[16:29.38]Were you breaking records back in the day, Jermo?
[16:32.51]Were you the crazy FPS gamer?
[16:34.94]Rank 1?
[16:35.91]See, he's tricking you.
[16:37.83]He made it sound like he used to.
[16:40.48]Dude, I go back- Do you use a sweat?
[16:42.33]I'm telling you, bag my- Please.
[16:45.09]Back when there were like seven people making TF2 videos-
[16:48.26]I went back and watched some of those videos.
[16:50.72]Hey, don't laugh at that because I know why you're laughing at it, but listen.
[16:54.22]I go back and watch some of those old TF2 One Life gameplay commentaries.
[16:58.77]Let me give you a quick synopsis.
[17:01.76]I play the game, and I have one life.
[17:04.63]If I die, the video's over.
[17:07.16]And I string it together like a 40 to 1 KD ratio.
[17:11.75]and just like jumping over people like boom boom like I wipe out that entire hallway
[17:17.44]I'm like, I can't play like that now.
[17:19.51]I haven't been able to play like that since I was like fucking 25, 30.
[17:23.08]Well, games don't have random crits anymore.
[17:27.43]I think you think you got worse or everyone got better I think everybody got better oh yeah
[17:35.34]there's that too but also consider this you were playing more it's like if you have that level of skill and then you go back to a game for like a day you're not going to be the same
[17:44.79]you could get better if you play for like a week straight like poke that's right you know poke are you like cracked at arc raiders like can you get good at that game
[17:55.96]Think so, yeah.
[17:56.47]I think I'm pretty good.
[17:59.12]I fumble a lot, but...
[18:00.84]I'm not consistent.
[18:02.45]I think I'm just not consistent like the young ones.
[18:04.82]You know what I'm saying?
[18:06.18]Those young gamers are just always good.
[18:09.16]They grew up with games.
[18:10.33]We grew up with games.
[18:11.76]But we didn't grow up with the same games.
[18:14.44]This person says, hey, thank God.
[18:15.69]I think I'm pretty good still on my age, though.
[18:17.92]I don't know.
[18:18.61]I think it's all...
[18:20.10]Apparently this is the only channel out of the four this person is not banned in.
[18:23.66]Well, be careful, man.
[18:24.99]Let's make it, let's go across the whole board then.
[18:27.69]Take a look at that guy.
[18:28.67]I want to find him.
[18:29.26]I'm curious about that.
[18:30.92]Go to your chat right now.
[18:32.95]I'm just saying, you're on thin ice.
[18:34.59]And you've already broken three different ices.
[18:37.70]We're playing Tarkov today, really?
[18:40.35]Yeah, we're all doing Tarky.
[18:41.41]1.0 wipe.
[18:42.52]Alright, we're going to play Restorats.
[18:44.32]It was good to catch up in the beginning here.
[18:46.29]We're going to play Restorats.
[18:49.12]It's a cooking game.
[18:51.33]I think this game has in-game VoIP.
[18:54.54]So I don't know if we want to switch to that.
[18:56.49]Apparently there's funny voices.
[18:57.43]VoIP is kind of a gross word.

[19:45.37]I got it.
[19:45.77]Totally.
[19:46.03]Totally.
[19:48.57]You know, I really got to go over the list.
[19:50.60]We talked about this.
[19:51.49]Dude, you start because we had like very similar ones.
[19:54.11]I'm not in a mind to remember things right now.
[20:00.13]Yeah.
[20:00.47]Okay.
[20:01.72]Skate.
[20:02.80]So that's yours?
[20:03.48]Skate?
[20:04.23]No.
[20:05.13]Probably Arc Raiders.
[20:06.34]No.
[20:07.64]Uh, okay.
[20:09.01]So, okay, Polk, Ark Raiders is your game of the year?
[20:13.13]Yes.
[20:15.02]Okay.
[20:15.66]Okay.
[20:15.96]You sound scared to say yes.
[20:17.24]Yeah, you sounded like you were like, I don't know.
[20:19.59]Expedition 33 people are coming for you.
[20:22.98]No, I don't care.
[20:23.74]But no, Arcade is good.
[20:26.62]I think it's great.
[20:28.25]Great game.
[20:28.93]Somebody said the rat's doing the Gen Z stare.
[20:31.22]What are you talking about?
[20:31.98]What?
[20:33.57]Yeah, he's got the Fent lean too.
[20:35.43]Alright, so ArtGraders, what about your second?
[20:37.62]What about top three?
[20:38.79]What are your top three?
[20:40.81]Top three.
[20:41.68]Okay, let's see.
[20:44.79]Um...
[20:48.09]Arc Raiders.
[20:51.61]Gate.
[20:55.09]Okay.
[20:55.31]And...
[20:57.76]Fuck, come on.
[21:00.21]It is kind of hard when you have to sit there and think about it.
[21:03.03]Maybe Battlefield 6.
[21:05.02]That's a poke list.
[21:07.55]It checks out.
[21:10.03]I don't mean that in a derogatory way poke but you know derogatory it's what I know I like that's what you like that's I get it
[21:18.52]boring ass hey dad gamer list it's just it's great though that's not dad gamer I got dad gamer list my I got Final Fantasy tactics
[21:28.07]I have a zin in my mouth.
[21:29.35]I need to play Battlefield.
[21:31.22]Are you eating zins?
[21:32.00]What do you mean?
[21:32.53]Are you serious?
[21:34.05]No, I played with a zin game the other day, so...
[21:37.60]Okay.
[21:39.59]But you're not taking those zins, are you?
[21:42.20]No, no, no.
[21:43.07]I have bad teeth already.
[21:43.89]I can't.
[21:46.21]Alright, well, that's a respectable list.
[21:49.24]It's a lot of your game time, right?
[21:50.89]So that makes sense to me.
[21:52.96]I mean, I heard people love Ark Raiders, but I'm not going to say no.
[21:55.45]I heard the game's great.
[21:56.89]I heard people love it.
[21:59.10]I mean, I don't know what else I played this year.
[22:01.53]I didn't try Claire.
[22:03.62]I was too busy playing Battlefield.
[22:05.97]Claire.
[22:07.59]Yeah, you know what I hate is happening about that game?
[22:10.04]I hate that I have to say this, but...
[22:12.23]I...
[22:13.13]Okay.
[22:13.62]That game apparently is incredible, right?
[22:15.60]I've never seen it.
[22:16.53]I've heard people love it.
[22:18.08]But...
[22:18.86]When I watched the Game Awards, and it was like a Lord of the Rings Return of the King situation.
[22:25.45]It was like, and best this, best...
[22:27.84]Expedition 33.
[22:30.05]It was nominated for almost every single category.
[22:31.94]Oh wait, the Game Awards happened already?
[22:34.35]nominations nominations oh yeah nomenoms so I I'm like damn like people is everybody love this game
[22:44.34]Is this just like the best game ever made and I'm just like being a guy that doesn't want to play it for some reason?
[22:50.21]Well, because it's a huge game, you know?
[22:52.52]But you have to be really into RPGs.
[22:54.25]I haven't played it, but I know people were like, Vin, you would like this.
[22:57.97]Because, I mean...
[22:58.97]but I play like one or two rpgs a year whether they be like classics or something semi-new-ish like a dragon quest that I've never played but
[23:08.96]This year, Final Fantasy Tactics Remaster left a huge impression on me.
[23:14.06]I'm not done with it yet, but that's one of my top favorites.
[23:17.61]It's not maybe my favorite.
[23:18.73]Very good, very good.
[23:19.56]And I'm like, I'm like, okay, I got like 30 hours in that.
[23:22.75]And then I know Expedition 33 is another several dozen of hours.
[23:28.42]Megabunk, dude.
[23:30.29]Oh yeah, Megabunk.
[23:32.97]True, I put it in there.
[23:35.10]Okay.
[23:35.89]I get it.
[23:36.49]It was a good game.
[23:38.01]I played it.
[23:38.40]Loved it.
[23:41.29]Yeah, it's a good one.
[23:42.56]For sure, for sure.
[23:44.87]And I know there were more, but I can't think of them at the moment.
[23:46.98]I liked Skate Poke, I did, but when they got rid of the glitches, I liked it less.
[23:51.61]Yeah, I hate it now.
[23:52.83]But I looked at my Steam and I had 100 hours in it.
[23:55.66]And I don't know how.
[23:56.60]Holy shit.
[23:57.62]Wow.
[23:57.86]So I played a lot in a short amount of time.
[24:00.01]So I must have liked it.
[24:01.95]gamer I like that list I mean I wouldn't tell you to play skate now but yeah it's it was great
[24:10.56]But back then, I was writing down games so I don't forget them.
[24:15.80]But now I'm too busy to look.
[24:18.12]Well, I'll Ster while you think and while you finish your run of White Knuckle.
[24:22.63]I'm right at the end.
[24:23.68]It's difficult.
[24:25.20]It's a great segue.
[24:26.31]Also, Jerma, let me just add, Metroid Prime 4 hasn't come out yet.
[24:30.00]So ask me again in a couple of weeks and we'll talk.
[24:32.49]I get you.
[24:32.99]I get you.
[24:34.67]Okay.
[24:34.75]Alright.
[24:35.24]Well, Ster's playing White Knuckle.
[24:37.96]I'm going to go backwards on my list.
[24:39.67]I'd say White Knuckle is number three.
[24:41.68]White Knuckle, I think, is the third slot bronze medal for Game of the Year.
[24:44.74]And I've only gotten to like a 25% through the game and I am incapable of going further, but I loved it.
[24:53.84]And it is so hard.
[24:55.75]I would love for them to add permanent saves and checkpoints.
[24:58.29]It's why it didn't get the number one spot.
[25:00.02]Unfortunate.
[25:02.56]Second, I'm going to throw you a curve ball.
[25:04.72]A lot of people forgot about this game because it came out so early in the year.
[25:07.26]Blueprints.
[25:08.79]Oh, that was great.
[25:09.84]Yeah.
[25:10.16]Blueprints was phenomenal.
[25:12.47]I loved it.
[25:13.88]Loved it.
[25:16.12]That was a cool one.
[25:17.24]Yeah.
[25:17.72]That's a game.
[25:18.26]That's like your Nancy Drew.
[25:20.17]Oh, dude.
[25:21.19]That game is just solving the puzzles inside the puzzles.
[25:24.79]It's not even about the doors opening and closing.
[25:26.66]Oh, I make sure I put the library next to the... No, I was like, what's going on with the...
[25:31.67]What's going on with the lore here?
[25:33.42]Who am I?
[25:34.10]Why am I here?
[25:35.37]I loved every second of it.
[25:36.65]Absolute silver medal for Game of the Year.
[25:38.58]So how could something be better than that, right?
[25:43.27]Look outside is the game of the year.
[25:46.00]oh god yeah that's been recommended to me a lot I heard that was awesome it is not only my favorite game of the year it's probably getting up to uh
[25:54.25]Like top 20 all time.
[25:59.59]That game was awesome.
[26:01.66]Every second of that game was amazing.
[26:05.10]I did not play it, but me and Jerma were talking about this.
[26:07.85]Even me having not played it, I would put that on like a top
[26:11.45]Somewhere near the top, just for like an honorable mention of how much I enjoyed watching other people play it.
[26:16.58]Soundtrack is incredible.
[26:18.82]And you know what's crazy about that game?
[26:20.55]And hopefully I'm not speaking out of turn on this.
[26:23.15]I think the dev made that.
[26:27.45]The dev made that as a side project for his huge game that he's already making.
[26:32.45]He made it for a game jam, right?
[26:34.21]And he was like, oh yeah, I'm going to make this fun little thing for a game jam.
[26:36.71]And people loved it.
[26:37.33]And he's like, oh shit.
[26:38.49]So he made it a full game.
[26:40.10]And he was in the middle of working on a much bigger project.
[26:43.23]That was like a side project.
[26:44.80]So, hey, dude, whatever side project, that's your side project?
[26:49.35]I'm looking forward to whatever comes out with next.
[26:53.50]Yeah, that's nuts.
[26:55.65]I loved it.
[26:56.15]Yeah.
[26:56.83]And that's a number one, huh?
[26:58.12]Also, Silksong came out this year, and a lot of people are going to
[27:00.81]probably say that's their favorite.
[27:02.63]I liked I didn't do the third act, but I really had a great time with it.
[27:08.67]Are you scared to say the real answer?
[27:12.87]What's the real answer?
[27:15.79]I'll leak the DMs.
[27:16.79]This game sucks, dude.
[27:18.16]Silksong blows.
[27:20.55]I got turned away from Silksong because I read people, I said people were like, hey, dude, the game is so fucking hard.
[27:28.08]Don't even play, dude, the game's hard.
[27:29.95]It's way too hard.
[27:31.86]Dude, I liked, I loved Hollow Knight, but this one's way too, you're going to hate it.
[27:36.86]It's too hard.
[27:37.50]It sucks.
[27:38.30]I'm like, oh, well, okay.
[27:39.97]Do I want to play a hard game right now?
[27:41.62]Is it too hard?
[27:43.41]I like Silksong.
[27:44.96]I'll put it on my Steam Deck.
[27:48.07]But it's hard the second or third act and then stopped.
[27:52.25]Yeah, it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard.
[27:54.68]I mean, a lot of
[27:56.93]I'm not good at games.
[27:58.32]Like, anyone will tell you they hate my gameplay.
[28:02.46]But...
[28:03.82]I did alright.
[28:04.98]I was going through bosses.
[28:06.19]It's just the exploration was fucking harder than the bosses.
[28:10.71]I got lost constantly.
[28:13.10]But
[28:14.21]I enjoyed it.
[28:15.06]You know what game though, would probably get my number one spot if I had to pick Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
[28:20.46]That was last year.
[28:21.24]Alright, so then Katamari, Once Upon a Katamari.
[28:25.77]That was good, too.
[28:27.63]I finished and I'm ready and I don't know the order, but y'all are forgetting Nightreign.
[28:33.79]No fucking respect on Nightreign's name.
[28:36.34]I can't okay I was gonna say Nightreign was great but I publicly gave it a 0.0 so I can't I can't do that yeah but you said you said 0.0
[28:45.06]I know, but you... How many hours do you have?
[28:50.01]At least 100 or something.
[28:52.12]At least 200.
[28:53.25]But, listen, I gave Elden Ring...
[28:58.41]I was publicly very annoyed.
[28:59.85]I think the game's a fucking 0.0.
[29:02.86]You can't give that game of the year like three months later, be like, Oh, actually, you know, I was that's not bumping it from like a seven to an eight or like an eight to an 8.5.
[29:11.27]You can't go from a 0.0 to like a 9.
[29:13.68]I'm sorry, but that was the single player and that's before, that's pre-patch.
[29:17.11]So I gave the multiplayer an 8.7.
[29:20.40]Yeah, like I agree with both.
[29:21.94]I really like Battlefield six, but 0.0 on the single player like you just sit in the lobby and there's no one there.
[29:28.51]That sucks.
[29:30.49]You didn't get a chance to even enjoy it.
[29:32.66]That's a shame.
[29:33.93]I played it with you guys that one time and that was it.
[29:36.70]And then I said to myself, I'm good.
[29:40.60]I played a hundred and something hours of Elden Ring.
[29:42.77]I was satisfied and Nightreign just didn't hit for me.
[29:46.18]I'm glad you guys enjoyed it.
[29:47.79]Elden Ring co-op was more fun for me.
[29:49.57]You know what I want to see you guys do?
[29:51.00]Yeah.
[29:51.32]This is an experiment that I'm doing too.
[29:52.71]I've been...
[29:53.39]It's going to take you a little while.
[29:54.34]A stream that I want to do and...
[29:57.91]I want to do where you pick, you go over, go through every generation
[30:02.92]and you find the games that actually had the most impact on you, whether it's, oh, these are my games of the year, every year, kind of like go back and look like, what did I actually love?
[30:11.77]Everything, going back to when you were like 12.
[30:14.72]Pick every game that's ever had a true, real impact on you.
[30:18.39]It could be 50, 60, 70 games.
[30:21.16]and rank them on a tier list do the actual ultimate what do you what is the top shit that you've loved your whole life
[30:31.39]You might surprise yourself.
[30:33.20]But yes, I, yeah.
[30:35.61]That's not hard for me.
[30:36.25]You might find out you like something that you don't even remember you ever even played.
[30:40.71]Dude, I'm saying it's going to be difficult because once Tiny Toons Adventures Wacky Sports for the Super Nintendo has to go up against Elden Ring.
[30:50.70]Wait a minute now.
[30:52.64]Hold on a second.
[30:54.23]That's fucked up because I probably put more hours into Tiny Toon Adventure Wacky Sports when I was like 13.
[30:59.84]That's the problem is nostalgia versus quality.
[31:03.03]Right.
[31:03.42]But would you not agree that when you were 13, you were a lesser person?
[31:06.91]No.
[31:08.72]From a mass perspective, like you had less of you?
[31:11.23]You are the same person you are growing.
[31:13.06]Your brain is growing.
[31:13.94]Your body is growing.
[31:14.69]You are the same person you're growing and evolving.
[31:17.71]Yeah, like Vinny said, you are like literally smaller.
[31:22.12]Mm-hmm.
[31:23.11]Okay, you're saying that to me?
[31:25.12]I hit the same height that I am now when I was like 15, man.
[31:30.17]I loved White Knuckle this year, but if I grew 10 times the size into a giantess, whatever game I play next is my favorite because I'm bigger when I play it.
[31:39.70]That's so stupid, but I okay, okay Ster is done playing his fucking game which You know what ends the conversation is me entering it
[31:49.69]You were just playing a game for like 20 minutes while we've been waiting for you.
[31:55.23]I'm ready.
[31:56.04]I said I was ready.
[31:57.12]That didn't end it.
[31:57.96]Me saying I was ready didn't end it.
[32:00.42]Is there a game in your guys' memory you played as a kid that you just can't remember?
[32:05.15]Like, have you ever experienced that?
[32:07.68]You mean like a game that you know you played, but you don't remember playing it?
[32:10.40]You know you played and you try to explain it, but you cannot find it no matter what you do.
[32:14.80]There's one flash game I went down this rabbit hole and explained it and found it and then lost it again and cannot explain it again.
[32:20.18]Yeah, I do kind of feel that way.
[32:25.87]Yeah, no.
[32:27.49]There's this one game, I swear I thought it was a dream, but my chat found it and it blew my mind.
[32:31.80]It was like some Sonic, we talked about it, like the creative thing for SEGA.
[32:37.48]The first SEGA shit.
[32:40.52]It's so funny.
[32:40.94]It took me till...
[32:41.93]It took me till I was in my mid-thirties to actually love SEGA.
[32:44.86]Like, it...
[32:45.55]It really...
[32:46.41]I developed, like, such a love... Like...
[32:48.18]I hated SEGA when I was younger, but the SEGA CD, the SEGA 32X, what a crock of shit.
[32:53.12]It's amazing.
[32:53.84]What a wonderful story.
[32:54.95]The commercials told me to hate it, so I hated it because I didn't have it.
[32:58.05]I was a hater.
[32:59.54]The SEGA CD is like my favorite console and now, but just because of how bizarre it was and how crazy it was that it's utter existence.
[33:06.29]This is back when the Sony PlayStation, it was the Nintendo PlayStation.
[33:10.85]You guys remember that shit?
[33:12.36]Yeah.
[33:15.91]Yeah.
[33:16.93]Remember when it was the PlayStation?
[33:20.71]Why?
[33:21.07]What about Costco?
[33:23.44]They always sell these like little arcade things.
[33:26.28]pac-man pac-man and shit and I bought this like little sonic one it was kind of cool it's like a whole sonic emulator in a little
[33:36.31]Let's see.
[33:37.09]I don't know if that was cool.
[33:38.52]Costco, Sonic, Emulio.
[33:39.98]I'm at Costco more than I should be because it's...
[33:42.84]I have invited you all to the lobby the gameplay mode is literally called friend slot oh alright is there like a lobby code that we're gonna leak or no

[57:18.71]Is this one better?
[57:22.57]feedback.
[57:24.09]Yeah, I love it.
[57:25.02]I get pulled aside.
[57:25.96]Poke pulls me aside and he's like, hey, dude, this is not going well.
[57:28.63]You're going to change your voice.
[57:30.38]Oh, that's so funny.
[57:31.68]This is so fucked up.
[57:36.26]Alright, we got so many plates we have to wash.
[57:41.16]I wash these plates.
[57:49.92]Poke, you just ate shit.
[57:50.90]I just saw you do that.
[57:53.90]You just ate shit and you're out of your hand.
[58:00.84]I tell you, Esther is having too much fun.
[58:04.33]Esther's having too much fun.
[58:08.14]Give me the Bambam!
[58:10.56]No!
[58:16.14]Ster has the most fun when he knows that he's like I get it I know what he's doing
[58:24.04]Yes.
[58:30.98]I...
[58:31.76]Wait, we leveled up!
[58:41.27]Wait, was it AI?
[58:47.60]Wait, what?
[58:49.75]Okay, I looked over in my chat.
[58:54.48]My chat was just like, hey, guys, slop.
[58:58.29]Uh-oh.
[59:03.28]Now if you have fun, you're a bad person.
[59:06.71]Devs have said they don't use AI.
[59:09.92]So it's okay to be not angry.
[59:12.88]Devs have promised no AI.
[59:15.21]Are you serious?
[59:16.38]That's what they say, they promise no AI.
[59:21.42]There's no Roblox server.
[59:23.89]This is a fucking...
[59:25.03]I've been trying to figure out what it was.
[59:27.06]What was going on here in my brain?
[59:29.39]This is a Roblox lobby.
[59:32.11]Stop mocking me!
[59:33.36]I feel like this is what happened when like a 10-year-old mocked me when I played it.
[59:39.20]And it's giving me flashbacks.
[59:43.13]Roblox.
[59:43.50]Never play Roblox.
[59:44.56]But it's just, uh... You should make your own Roblox.
[59:48.52]Oh, cool.
[59:50.27]Minibox.
[59:55.91]If I made a video game, I think every character they could do a big jump.
[60:03.99]What?
[60:04.83]What?
[60:06.39]Alright, here's what we're gonna do, boys.
[60:08.30]We're making new recipes here.
[60:10.81]Alright, I'm the rat that's making all the rules now.
[60:17.95]Something is burning.
[60:26.34]Something's burning.
[60:28.71]Oh, that might be the poop.
[60:30.64]Okay, recipe book open.
[60:33.93]You guys are cooking, not me.
[60:35.39]This is too hard.
[60:37.28]Alright, open the shop.
[60:40.19]What do you want to buy?
[60:44.16]We gotta buy, um... Can we buy flour?
[60:50.50]Who keeps jostling me?
[60:52.01]Stark?
[60:52.37]I'm jostling.
[60:53.19]You're a regular jostler tree.
[61:03.37]Okay.
[61:05.99]Alright, so... Um...
[61:10.10]Okay.
[61:12.91]Okay.
[61:12.99]Alright.
[61:14.59]Nobody has done... Alright, listen.
[61:16.62]Um...
[61:18.01]I'm calling an audible.
[61:20.15]I'm calling an audible.
[61:21.52]I'm calling an audible.
[61:23.25]I'm calling an audible.
[61:25.14]I got flour.
[61:25.92]We got the flour.
[61:28.21]How do you build the oven?
[61:29.65]Where is it?
[61:30.51]Oh I got it.
[61:39.66]This place is disgusting.
[61:41.04]They're cooking rats.
[61:45.83]How do you guys feel so far about the game?
[61:50.01]Are you guys feeling good?
[61:52.67]I don't know, we're still in the tutorial.
[61:54.92]We're still in the tutorial.
[62:01.41]I think Jerma just don't like hearing me talk.
[62:04.44]I think Jerma's hungry.
[62:06.25]Cause I'm hungry too.
[62:10.72]Did you guys eat today?
[62:13.39]Hey, you know, hey, you know.
[62:14.95]I'll eat again.
[62:16.36]You know, not just eating again.
[62:17.61]We could, if you guys want to potentially, we could turn the voices off of this shit.
[62:23.15]Yeah.
[62:24.02]Who is that?
[62:24.64]Stop.
[62:27.00]The ogres are here.
[62:28.05]The ogres are here.
[62:33.62]I got something for them.
[62:41.28]I got flowers?
[62:42.43]Taxi- Dude, we can make dough!
[62:55.61]Do re mi fa sol...
[63:08.08]Hey, what does that sound like?
[63:10.28]Stop shitting.
[63:11.09]Okay.
[63:13.43]Take any moment from this like 30 minutes we've been playing.
[63:17.04]You could just do random cuts if you wanted to and it would be like a video of this game.
[63:22.15]What does the fart sound like, my bitch?
[63:25.11]What does it sound like?
[63:28.69]Wow, you farted real.
[63:34.66]Anyways.
[63:37.27]Pick- Okay, wait.
[63:39.78]Slice the mushrooms.
[63:41.30]We don't have mushrooms.
[63:42.23]They're gone.
[63:43.43]Do we have any customers?
[63:55.94]Stay still for a minute.
[64:10.92]What happened to Vinny's voice?
[64:21.72]What happened to it?
[64:25.86]Is it low?
[64:26.46]Is it broken?
[64:27.33]What's going on?
[64:28.15]You sound... You sound low but high at the same time.
[64:35.60]Oh, it changes...
[64:36.68]Okay, I get it.
[64:40.64]How do we get more mushrooms?
[64:43.53]Aren't they right here?
[64:44.27]I ordered a bunch.
[64:46.52]I ordered a bunch.
[64:47.06]They should be around.
[64:47.61]They're sliced up.
[64:51.29]We have to cut them.
[65:00.97]Why is it turning into shit when I cut the mushrooms?
[65:07.57]Guys, I got new mushrooms.
[65:15.88]Alright, so speaking of food speaking of food yeah, I
[65:25.93]I'm trying to transition us.
[65:28.18]Do the thing.
[65:29.24]I'm trying to transition us.
[65:36.29]We are so out of sync with this.
[65:38.89]We're so out of sync with this.
[65:40.69]Okay.
[65:42.42]Half of us are... Alright, listen.
[65:44.98]I'm going to turn... Do you guys...
[65:47.25]I'm going to go over here.
[65:50.46]Unmute Discord right now.
[65:51.77]Unmute Discord.
[65:52.45]We've got to talk about something.
[65:54.68]Okay.
[65:55.90]Oh my god!
[65:56.81]I...
[66:04.51]That's a very stimulating game.
[66:08.67]Yeah.
[66:11.08]But anyways, what I want to talk about
[66:15.76]Alright, stop putting shit on me.
[66:17.35]Yeah, I'm muting the game.
[66:18.56]I want to talk about Thanksgiving.
[66:26.26]You know, the holiday Thanksgiving, it was actually amazing for those of you that don't know, um, I hosted Thanksgiving this year.
[66:35.85]And, uh, the boys were invited.
[66:39.00]And it was actually awesome to have you here.
[66:42.29]And I...
[66:44.28]Hold on, why is my thing... Oh, I'm talking to the game still.
[66:47.70]Hold on, let me do this.
[66:48.43]Yeah.
[66:51.18]There we go.
[66:53.87]How do I beat myself in the game?
[66:54.89]Are we just closing the game then?
[66:56.58]Let's close the game.
[66:58.27]Minimize it.
[66:59.03]I feel like we just beat the tutorial.
[67:02.34]I was enjoying throwing poop at you guys.
[67:04.83]It sticks to you.
[67:05.79]It's fun.
[67:09.12]Okay, it was too fucked up.
[67:10.21]Start chasing me around, giving me Roblox flashbacks.
[67:14.29]I was in my vtuber model uh we have a video to show of our Thanksgiving get together
[67:20.90]We wanted to record it.
[67:22.21]We wanted to make sure that we were, you know, everyone was in attendance.
[67:26.37]It was a really fun time.
[67:28.23]um and I you guys you guys want to get it queued up here yeah how do we do this it's all we wait
[67:37.54]Do you guys, the video is in that folder, if you have it, or you can open up somebody's stream if you want.
[67:45.07]I think we should mute.
[67:46.65]We should definitely not be talking during this.
[67:51.82]So does everybody want to get it up or do let me know when everybody's got it.
[67:54.83]I got it ready.
[67:55.59]I got it ready.
[67:56.84]Yeah.
[67:56.96]I mean, what have you shared on Discord?
[67:59.56]Uh, it might be hard to do that considering the, my Discord has lots of trouble screen sharing.
[68:10.51]I'm down to press play whenever you guys are ready.
[68:12.42]I have it all ready.
[68:13.63]Yeah, I'm basically at zero, right?
[68:16.24]So we do like a three, two, one, zero, and then we press play.
[68:19.59]What do you think?
[68:20.22]Yeah, everybody mute.
[68:21.46]3, 2, 1, 0?
[68:23.33]Who does 3, 2, 1, 0?
[68:25.28]Is that 3, 2, 1, go?
[68:26.76]3, 2, 1, go.
[68:28.17]Yes.
[68:30.21]So the context for this is we got together, all of us in the same room, all together, having a great time, having a Thanksgiving dinner.
[68:38.65]Last minute, by the way, getting a flight was fucked.
[68:41.84]I had two flights in one day.
[68:43.60]It's crazy.
[68:45.75]It was crazy.
[68:47.41]Yeah, it was nuts.
[68:49.21]But yeah, I am going to, we'll do it on zero.
[68:53.75]We're going to be muted anyway, so it's fine.
[68:55.30]Just let it play out.
[68:58.09]Yeah.
[68:58.47]Alright.
[68:58.93]So you guys ready?
[69:00.91]Yeah.
[69:02.01]I will count us down.
[69:04.89]In three, two, one, begin.
[69:10.56]Gentlemen, how are we?
[69:13.29]Hey, guys.
[69:14.39]Happy Thanksgiving.
[69:15.32]It's great to see you.
[69:18.05]Happy Thanksgiving.
[69:20.60]I got my meal right here.
[69:23.02]I'm so excited.
[69:23.60]I am very grateful for hosting this year.
[69:26.48]Turkey dinner.
[69:27.81]I can't start yet.
[69:28.63]Turkey dinner.
[69:29.54]Yeah.
[69:30.40]It's great.
[69:31.15]I know we draw names.
[69:32.09]I'll wait until we're all ready.
[69:33.61]I got lucky this year and I'm really happy about that.
[69:35.56]I'm happy.
[69:35.88]All the delicious things everybody brought stream.
[69:38.80]I mean, who brought these potatoes?
[69:40.59]They look phenomenal.
[69:42.84]Hey, I think it's public.
[69:43.61]Oh yeah, totally.
[69:45.62]No, happy Thanksgiving.
[69:47.97]This is the first, what, first annual?
[69:50.59]Four Horsemen Thanksgiving dinner?
[69:53.57]Well, welcome, all three of you.
[69:55.04]I'm absolutely stunned that I got to do it this year.
[69:58.39]Without a doubt.
[69:59.92]The stuffing would be my number one pick.
[70:03.49]Yeah, it's great.
[70:04.86]I'm very excited.
[70:05.98]So good.
[70:06.78]Before we start, a tradition in my family that I'd like to translate over to this one, because we are a family.
[70:14.17]I'd like to say Grace, if we could.
[70:17.12]Rock Lee over green beans.
[70:18.97]Yeah.
[70:20.06]Just give a little bit of a thought, a prayer for what we did before.
[70:25.51]I do it with my family.
[70:26.90]I want to do it over here with you guys too.
[70:28.02]If that's okay.
[70:29.31]Sweet potato.
[70:30.89]Or regular potato.
[70:32.34]Whatever potato you prefer.
[70:33.56]But you've got to have it.
[70:35.39]Vinny?
[70:37.78]Yeah, okay, if we could.
[70:42.27]We don't talk during grace.
[70:44.52]It's a little chilly out here.
[70:46.41]We don't speak during grace.
[70:47.79]No.
[70:49.26]But it's okay.
[70:49.86]We'll talk after.
[70:52.37]Can you get your mom to get me some wine, please?
[70:55.65]We are gathered here with three of my friends, four of us as a one fun unit of people hanging out and having a good time.
[71:03.79]Sometimes you need a little bit of motivation for your meal.
[71:06.44]Yeah, wine, please.
[71:08.55]And I'm very thankful for people talking during Grace.
[71:12.51]I mean...
[71:13.84]that I would like to reprimand them for.
[71:16.00]But I'm going to talk a little louder over them.
[71:17.77]No, dark meat.
[71:18.94]Well, my name's Ken.
[71:19.48]I can't decide.
[71:19.86]So thank you for coming.
[71:20.66]Thank you for a lot of you had a long trip.

[71:39.66]There goes my whole plan.
[71:41.11]I still have the duck food.
[71:42.19]It's really all that I have.
[71:44.08]I have jerky fresh.
[71:45.76]Thanksgiving.
[71:47.17]I know somebody brought that.
[71:48.56]We all brought something, right?
[71:50.94]Yeah, but no, I'm happy to be here with you guys.
[71:52.98]I think it was the Pilgrims that discovered it.
[71:56.05]Thanksgiving, they discovered Thanksgiving, yeah.
[71:57.73]At least we can have a meal together.
[71:59.44]And then later...
[72:01.26]later after the Pilgrims discovered it.
[72:03.64]Your food looks pretty good.
[72:05.02]Those are delicious.
[72:08.96]Those potatoes are so fluffy.
[72:10.80]Yeah.
[72:11.57]You guys who were in the war.
[72:15.72]The Washingtons.
[72:16.56]It's so good.
[72:17.49]Yeah.
[72:19.07]Those guys, like the soldiers.
[72:22.84]It's healthy.
[72:24.14]Nutritious.
[72:24.93]Yeah, they kept Thanksgiving going.
[72:26.97]Yeah, sir, I did play it.
[72:28.72]Yeah, it's not bad.
[72:30.61]Yeah.
[72:31.17]That is the best Call of Duty, for sure.
[72:32.88]Yeah, that one.
[72:33.71]Yeah.
[72:35.17]It could be worse.
[72:37.92]Really?
[72:38.24]It's very cold.
[72:40.18]Really?
[72:40.48]But I'm glad we all worked hard with the attire.
[72:44.64]Yeah, we'll play Battlefield later if you want.
[72:46.52]I'm down.
[72:48.48]What's that?
[72:51.42]Man.
[72:51.94]What?
[72:52.49]I thought you said something.
[72:53.21]I'm sorry.
[72:53.51]Vinny?
[72:56.17]Did I even say hi to Ster?
[72:57.00]What do you mean?
[72:57.36]You know, I think it's fine, you know?
[72:58.89]Ster!
[72:59.11]Okay, I'll shut up, guys.
[73:01.59]I do.
[73:02.17]Yeah, I eat at my computer desk like once a year.
[73:04.10]That's all he gets.
[73:04.86]Yeah, you know.
[73:05.47]This is my special one time a year.
[73:07.37]It's for family.
[73:08.03]It's Thanksgiving.
[73:08.68]So wait, what?
[73:10.50]Vinny, if you could.
[73:12.09]You guys are kind of like family, you know, especially.
[73:14.18]Tell us the story that you told me on the phone.
[73:15.94]We've got to talk about that.
[73:17.05]About what happened to you at the airport.
[73:19.12]Listen, this is funny.
[73:20.41]Why would they're better hot?
[73:23.50]People are crazy.
[73:25.20]Alright, in chemistry...
[73:25.90]I didn't want to eat anymore.
[73:27.21]I didn't want to fucking eat anymore.
[73:29.30]No!
[73:29.54]I mean, we worked on this, man.
[73:30.91]We worked on this so hard.
[73:33.08]are you that's where you're lying yeah he's over there I literally tried my best remember we were drilling we were studying together
[73:43.51]No, the teacher was racist towards me.
[73:47.21]In phys ed?
[73:47.99]Yeah.
[73:48.92]But here's one thing, though, that I did hear.
[73:51.83]And I really don't want to do this on Thanksgiving because...
[73:54.90]I don't care.
[73:55.26]It's a little awkward for you.
[73:58.97]You guys always do this.
[74:00.87]We can talk about those grades.
[74:03.20]Especially those grades in science.
[74:06.02]This family
[74:07.54]We have tons of relatives.
[74:12.53]I come from Socrates.
[74:13.36]That means you come from Socrates.
[74:14.49]That means he comes from Socrates.
[74:15.65]That means he grows from Socrates.
[74:17.95]I don't know why it's Jerma.
[74:19.22]You almost made him cry.
[74:20.48]And you get down from there.
[74:21.47]I mean, it's nice that you got an A in math.
[74:24.16]You got an A in trigonometry.
[74:25.33]No, you just do what you want to do.
[74:26.37]You got an A in physics, you got an A in... You guys do what you gotta do to make yourselves feel better.
[74:31.29]But everything else... We worked harder.
[74:34.03]We worked harder than that.
[74:37.21]Remember when you were in Vegas?
[74:40.20]Thanks for inviting me, by the way, guys.
[74:42.67]Yes, sir.
[74:43.22]My chair made a sound.
[74:44.18]It's not a big deal.
[74:45.85]It's not a big deal.
[74:46.73]It's just my chair.
[74:47.85]Yeah, I went back to the old one.
[74:49.74]Uh, maybe, um... We can bring it up with you by the way.
[74:54.69]Somebody, you could pass me some of yours.
[74:56.65]I'll try losing weight.
[74:57.82]I don't know.
[74:58.22]I like trying new foods.
[74:59.28]I can crush some of that.
[75:00.97]Can I eat this?
[75:03.50]Can I eat this?
[75:05.22]Thank you.
[75:05.57]Does anybody want?
[75:08.04]No, I wouldn't say I like mushrooms more than any other particular thing.
[75:15.83]This is delicious.
[75:16.78]We didn't even talk about Jerma, like... Do you guys not see what he looks like today?
[75:21.36]Oh, for sure.
[75:24.81]No one's gonna talk about what he did to his face today.
[75:28.30]Yeah.
[75:28.42]Yeah, for sure.
[75:30.09]I mean, it's not that I have a, it's not a big deal.
[75:34.93]but the one actually does taste better.
[75:38.78]Oh, yeah.
[75:39.53]No specifics.
[75:41.18]You gotta watch out for that one.
[75:43.14]That one's really guarding the bowl.
[75:46.73]You guys want some purple?
[75:49.42]I thought it was shorter than that.
[75:50.75]I'd like mushrooms.
[75:53.07]Purple.
[75:54.24]This is just like Grandma used to make.
[75:55.76]I'm usually not this fancy.
[75:57.25]The 20s.
[75:59.01]Purple.
[76:01.93]The turkey is interesting.
[76:03.34]I don't care.
[76:03.62]Screw you guys.
[76:04.67]Ster, I think it's 375 for four hours, not 375 for 30 minutes.
[76:10.39]We didn't read the back of the package on this one.
[76:14.48]Disgusting.
[76:21.54]You guys always do this to me every fucking day.
[76:28.90]For what reason?
[76:30.94]Oh, shit.
[76:31.46]Say a prayer or something.
[76:33.67]Like, give thanks for the food.
[76:35.48]Yeah, a little bit.
[76:37.31]Like, I know Jerma already did.
[76:39.45]But what about the rest?
[76:40.31]It reminds me of the Red Sox.
[76:42.92]I already feel high from the food.
[76:45.41]You've just seen the Sox this year?
[76:47.55]It's crazy.
[76:49.00]I think they were like 80 and 80?
[76:52.27]Or 80 and 90?
[76:54.92]They traded for this guy.
[76:56.17]I don't want to talk about my mobile.
[76:57.07]They traded for this guy.
[76:58.79]Ster.
[76:59.20]Ster.
[76:59.32]Hold on.
[76:59.94]Ster, you did a great, you really did a great job.
[77:02.89]the broccoli came out fantastic I mean you killed it with the broccoli I'm really yeah I'm into it man
[77:12.71]It's nice weather.
[77:14.54]I'm being too much?
[77:16.27]A little cold.
[77:17.43]A little cold Thanksgiving.
[77:19.99]No, it's good.
[77:20.77]Yeah, I mean, well, I was saying that they traded for this guy.
[77:24.55]Yeah, I love to eat on microphone.
[77:25.65]I don't even know his name.
[77:26.76]I know he can throw like 110 miles per hour.
[77:28.44]Wow, this is great.
[77:30.53]Dude, your family cooks really well.
[77:33.14]Hold on, someone's calling me.
[77:35.21]It's crazy.
[77:37.24]110 miles per hour pitch would kill you if it hit you, right?
[77:41.36]You have to do this Thanksgiving thing.
[77:44.75]I mean, I'm not a fan.
[77:45.30]I don't really like that.
[77:45.92]Hold on, I got it.
[77:46.82]Yeah, it's on my face.
[77:47.99]Not too bad.
[77:48.77]Not really.
[77:49.51]Genuinely not bad.
[77:52.30]Eat it.
[77:54.00]Oh, my God.
[77:54.40]They suck this year.
[77:55.21]Oh, my God.
[77:57.15]The New York Giants?
[77:59.82]Or the New York Jets, the Knicks.
[78:03.36]Pay attention.
[78:05.52]The Yankee Yankees.
[78:07.73]Oh, my God.
[78:12.67]The foul ball over the end zone.
[78:15.90]I couldn't believe it.
[78:17.61]I couldn't believe it.
[78:19.38]It's a bomb.
[78:20.36]It's a bomb.
[78:22.01]Bobson, Dugnut.
[78:23.24]Ster.
[78:24.02]Bum.
[78:24.42]Barn early apple juice.
[78:25.35]Ludovico treatment.
[78:26.17]I did hear about that.
[78:27.49]What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
[78:29.10]Johnson.
[78:31.19]Johnson Murphy?
[78:32.52]This is the best apple juice in the world.
[78:33.85]Horrible.
[78:34.49]You see how he fumbled that shit?
[78:37.39]They're pretty good this year.
[78:39.45]Three-pointer.
[78:40.60]You put James on the ball.
[78:42.71]I mean, the end, it was right there.
[78:44.89]It's really important to support your local...
[78:47.46]Anything, local communities, sports teams.
[78:50.55]I mean, come on.
[78:51.31]I do all the local sports.
[78:56.71]Wouldn't happen if you got better grades, Poe.
[78:58.54]No, yeah, sorry, you're right.
[78:59.48]I won't talk with my mouth.
[79:01.65]Hey, yo, Ma!
[79:02.27]I'm fine.
[79:03.32]More fries!
[79:10.99]It's fine.
[79:13.78]Thanks, Mom.
[79:14.86]It's just like my ancestors.
[79:18.48]Mm-hmm.
[79:21.57]Oh, skin is great.
[79:23.13]Three or four hours, not 20 minutes.
[79:26.38]God damn it.
[79:30.15]Yes, I'm talking to you.
[79:32.77]I would love that.
[79:35.38]Thank you.
[79:37.79]Hand it to me.
[79:38.25]Give it to me.
[79:39.39]Oh, man.
[79:39.96]Thank you, Jerma.
[79:40.64]If you hand it to me, I'll take it.
[79:42.52]This is really, I'm going to be very, thank you.
[79:44.52]This is nice.
[79:45.25]I give thanks.
[79:46.25]He's going to pull it back.
[79:46.96]I can't get it.
[79:48.13]Thanks a lot.
[79:48.79]It works.
[79:49.82]Take some Martinelli's apple juice, please.
[79:51.98]Well, I'll pass it along.
[79:52.85]Hang on.
[79:54.71]Ster.
[79:55.37]He didn't even give it to me.
[79:56.98]Wait, what?
[79:57.88]Oh, okay.
[79:59.51]You like these guys.
[80:00.41]Hot sauce?
[80:02.88]What the hell?
[80:03.42]That's for you.
[80:04.20]Ster, you made a hot sauce?
[80:07.33]You're welcome.
[80:08.16]Happy Thanksgiving.
[80:08.62]Ster, you're right there.
[80:09.42]You made a hot sauce?
[80:11.83]Yeah, I'll try your hot sauce.
[80:12.97]It's nice to have friends.
[80:13.86]You know, we had a... Don't give me food.
[80:16.06]I don't know how to eat.
[80:16.89]You made a hot sauce.
[80:17.95]Everybody knows I don't eat food.
[80:19.41]food.
[80:20.95]Let's all do like a fun thing together.
[80:22.58]Let's all eat food.
[80:24.08]Just because somebody almost pukes during Thanksgiving does not mean that everybody's food was bad.
[80:30.50]You brought the mashed potatoes.
[80:32.17]You brought the stuffing.
[80:33.21]You cooked the turkey.
[80:34.47]I got the cranberry sauce, okay?
[80:36.68]I'm the one that made the cranberry sauce.
[80:38.25]Is it at a stand?
[80:39.67]No.
[80:43.83]My family owns Cranberry Bogs in Massachusetts, stupid.
[80:46.82]Yeah, you're right.
[80:48.47]No, I'm sorry.
[80:49.17]You're right.
[80:49.63]I thought it was supposed to be hot.
[80:51.72]Yeah.
[80:55.24]I'm sorry, yeah, no.
[80:57.35]Does that look like can to you, sir?
[81:00.78]Huh?
[81:02.01]Yeah, I said I'm sorry!
[81:04.25]I can't even remember.
[81:06.50]Last time that happened.
[81:07.66]Yeah.
[81:09.63]God, must have been three.
[81:12.67]No, no way.
[81:15.71]Yeah.
[81:18.32]Oh, boy.
[81:18.76]It is cold.
[81:19.34]No, no, no.
[81:19.76]It's pretty shit.
[81:20.48]No, no.
[81:20.88]Listen.
[81:22.55]No, no, no.
[81:24.01]No.
[81:24.75]Well, I'm just trying to enjoy the food.
[81:26.76]It's a blessing to have you all here.
[81:31.88]I'm going to take a second here to tell you guys.
[81:34.78]I'm grateful how good this shit is.
[81:36.47]I hope you guys left room for dessert, seriously.
[81:39.22]I haven't been able to eat in years.
[81:42.47]Wasn't it good, though?
[81:43.28]Wasn't it good, the cranberry?
[81:44.40]The turkey was okay.
[81:45.29]The turkey is undercooked.
[81:45.97]I've not been able to eat in years.
[81:47.92]Very undercooked.
[81:49.33]That wasn't my department, though.
[81:54.37]Thank you.
[81:56.98]If I hear anymore screaming from this side... You can't, I mean, you have to have that pie.
[82:02.03]Okay?
[82:03.48]I don't have it.
[82:03.86]Stop screaming.
[82:04.30]We're failing.
[82:04.70]You do.
[82:05.40]Thank you, guys.
[82:07.77]I'm okay.
[82:08.25]I'm okay.
[82:09.35]You can tell us.
[82:10.74]You don't have to yell it.
[82:16.15]man you know what guys I'm gonna save some room for the apple pie
[82:25.42]Absolutely.
[82:26.93]No.
[82:30.04]In the Alps?
[82:30.74]Yeah.
[82:32.23]That's fine.
[82:32.49]Yep.
[82:32.59]I don't, I have no idea.
[82:39.71]That was fantastic.
[82:41.44]That was great.
[82:42.30]No, the sauce isn't bad.
[82:43.57]Stuffing.
[82:44.99]Perfect.
[82:45.90]Like really, really good.
[82:47.65]Ster your broccoli.
[82:48.41]It was phenomenal.
[82:50.01]Polk, you did a good job with the potato.
[82:53.16]And Jerma, I'm really proud of you.
[82:55.80]The gravy was fantastic.
[82:58.11]This is cold.
[82:58.61]Great meal.
[82:59.29]I hope you enjoyed my string beans.
[83:00.90]Why would you name it hot sauce if it's cold?
[83:04.16]and I hope you all know anybody very happy thanks Germany you're so weird let's eat let's eat some apple pie you're the weirdest guy
[83:13.60]You know that?
[83:14.20]I swear I've seen your face on the internet.
[83:18.46]We talk for a living.
[83:20.19]Each one of us does this for a living.
[83:22.20]And we can't come up with anything to say.
[83:23.99]I had a great time, guys.
[83:25.53]I thought this was a great time.
[83:28.02]We all talked about shit and nobody has really anything of value to say right now.
[83:31.43]Yeah, I think it's really healthy.
[83:36.48]Yeah.
[83:37.30]Okay.
[83:41.96]I mean, it was an absolute pleasure, though.
[83:44.46]Of course it was, Vinny.
[83:46.86]And Ster, it's... Yeah.
[83:50.87]Ster, I don't... No, for sure.
[83:53.96]Ster, you almost weren't invited, okay?
[83:57.13]What?
[83:58.62]I'm just kidding.
[83:59.48]What'd you say?
[83:59.98]I'm kidding, you were right.
[84:02.69]Can you say that?
[84:05.20]Mm-hmm.
[84:05.36]What the fuck?
[84:06.12]No, I'm not...
[84:09.27]Fuck you.
[84:10.68]That was an absolute pleasure.
[84:12.55]I'm so happy that we did this.
[84:14.84]And we have.
[84:16.61]Three weeks of fun planned between the four of us.
[84:20.65]I've got a plan every single day.
[84:22.02]Again, thank you for letting me host.
[84:24.01]I appreciate it.
[84:25.67]Next year, we're going to Sturz.
[84:27.67]Are we going to go to Vinny's?
[84:37.84]Okay, I'm going to unmute.
[84:43.64]Oh, what a journey.
[84:46.09]Wow.
[84:48.10]I'm full.
[84:48.84]That dinner was crazy.
[84:51.15]That was very filling.
[84:52.54]Did you enjoy my burger?
[84:55.51]It was good.
[84:56.58]Yeah.
[84:57.34]I'm glad you like the broccoli.
[84:58.93]I worked hard on it.
[85:00.34]Yeah, I could tell.
[85:00.94]You brought it up a lot.
[85:03.18]A lot, lot.
[85:06.29]uh alright well let's give some context because I think people a lot of people are confused I think a lot of you guys got it do you want to bring it up do you should we even do it or just should we move on to play the rv game
[85:20.09]Yeah, do it.
[85:21.12]Okay.
[85:21.44]Sorry.
[85:22.83]That was like the end of the video.
[85:24.58]Yeah, we're not here.
[85:26.01]We're just talking to no one for like 45 seconds.
[85:27.74]Why did you guys leave so early, by the way?
[85:29.51]Wait, yeah, Stuart, you were gone in like 11, okay, for context.
[85:33.46]we we wanted to do a thing where it's like hey everybody record yourself for 15 minutes
[85:40.66]We don't know what anybody else is saying.
[85:42.49]Everybody is individual.
[85:43.33]We have no idea.
[85:43.89]It's not like, oh, we're going to listen to, I'll listen to Ster's video while I'm... No, we all independently did this on our own.
[85:50.47]And we were just desperately seeing if we could come up with anything to talk about.
[85:55.49]And it's weird to like kind of have no feedback, but know that there is feedback.
[86:00.17]But there's three points.
[86:03.49]We wanted to talk about Poke's report card, a local sports team, and how the food was, and trying to pass things back and forth.
[86:13.18]So it was fun.
[86:15.40]It was a great talk about how you wrote.
[86:18.26]Four minutes talk about pokes report card and you didn't even do that.
[86:22.49]No, I did I did no I did I did
[86:26.97]I did.
[86:27.63]Hold on.
[86:29.14]Listen, listen, listen.
[86:30.32]I bring it up, like, right here.
[86:31.47]I go, we gotta talk about PokeSport.
[86:32.89]I did it so late, though.
[86:34.56]Alright, so...
[86:35.73]okay so for for more context we had no timers but we knew hey at three minutes
[86:42.93]Bring up Polk's report card.
[86:45.42]I mistimed it.
[86:46.33]You guys are like, Ster, you're like, oh, Polk's report card.
[86:48.96]Vinny, you're like, oh, exactly.
[86:50.32]I was like a minute late.
[86:52.07]I was like a minute late.
[86:53.50]Let me get it.
[86:54.44]Here it is.
[86:55.61]Yeah, let's get a recap.
[86:58.50]Let's watch it again.
[87:00.36]Pfft
[87:01.06]I would love to see an edit of all the really good syncs, because there was at least like four or five really, really good ones, probably more than that, actually.
[87:10.39]yeah battlefield part now I was gonna do my whole one at the duck pond and then the dude showed up and took all the ducks
[87:18.61]you stole them yeah they all went to him and he had like a giant camera and a professional setup and he started talking to me I was like well I gotta I gotta go home oh man
[87:28.80]Yeah, I didn't know if you were going to be sitting at the... Because I... And another thing, too, is we didn't watch this...
[87:33.79]um I I had to video I didn't know how disgusting I was oh man that was it was wonderfully horrendous
[87:43.31]I had no idea what I was doing.
[87:45.36]If you go back, if you go back and watch
[87:48.68]and kind of see everybody's, it's hard to pay attention to, but when you know the context of like, okay, everyone's just kind of doesn't know what they're doing.
[87:56.07]it is really funny that sometimes somebody somebody's name will be said and they will look over in the right spot it's weird that happened a couple times it was amazing
[88:04.03]Yeah, I also I came to the epiphany like it was a few minutes and I knew you were going to do a prayer thing.
[88:08.82]I was like, oh, Jerma Jerma probably already did grace.
[88:13.63]That was good.
[88:14.58]The best part is when you said, I'm sorry you slammed the table.
[88:19.13]Oh, that was crazy.
[88:20.70]That part was insane.
[88:21.80]That was the best one.
[88:23.52]Ending's good.
[88:25.51]What I wanted to do was at times I wasn't sure if I should talk generally.
[88:29.87]And then I came up with the idea of like, okay, you guys are around me like midway through.
[88:35.37]And Jerma, you had that from the beginning, I think.
[88:37.92]You had the idea, okay, Vinny's to my right, Polk is this way, Jerma stirs that way.
[88:42.56]And I didn't realize that for a little while.
[88:44.59]And then I came to that.
[88:46.91]It's hard because you don't wanna, trying to not talk.
[88:51.43]It's a fun experiment because trying to not speak when you think you shouldn't,
[88:55.75]Like, oh yeah, of course, like four of us are talking at the same time.
[88:58.71]We have to, I gotta, I gotta like shut up for like a minute.
[89:01.50]Like I have some...
[89:02.49]somebody has to be talking about what I wanted to, what I was, um, like really, really looking forward to is if we all just didn't talk, cuz we all were afraid of talking over each other.
[89:10.81]It happened like once or twice a little bit.
[89:14.32]Yeah, it was a little bit.
[89:15.62]It was a little bit.
[89:16.21]But my chat was saying that I had no conflict in my world.
[89:19.58]And in retrospect...
[89:22.87]In retrospect, I didn't know how...
[89:26.42]I mean, of course you guys were going to introduce conflict.
[89:28.91]But I thought we were just doing this harmonious Thanksgiving dinner.
[89:32.56]We're all having peace and love.
[89:34.53]And then I'm looking at it, and you guys are fighting with each other half of the time.
[89:39.66]Poke, you're being mistreated by your parents in the video.
[89:45.50]We're like...
[89:46.59]I was disappointed in you, at least.
[89:48.61]But...
[89:49.21]At least I was disappointed in you.
[89:52.83]I wanted to fit in and hate you guys too.
[89:56.22]I was hungry.
[89:57.73]The mug was good.
[89:58.46]What was the mug?
[89:59.69]Yeah, I can't believe we're late.
[90:01.42]Just a lady from Twitch sings long time ago.
[90:03.87]Oh, we actually synced up the past, the past.
[90:06.97]Okay, remember, we don't have any timers.
[90:08.72]None of us is keeping time at all.
[90:09.93]We just know it's 15 minutes.
[90:12.18]we actually synced up the pass because you picked up the kazoo and I'm like oh give me that give me that
[90:17.46]And then you, I passed something to poke and poke.
[90:20.86]It's hot.
[90:21.35]That was, I couldn't believe that actually synced up the hot sauce.
[90:26.41]Wait, the hot sauce one?
[90:27.51]Hang on a minute.
[90:28.12]I don't rewatch that real quick.
[90:29.49]Do you guys want to just rewatch the whole thing?
[90:34.05]my chat was kind of like this you could tell this is a Jerma joke because it's gone on way too long
[90:39.43]Yeah, it becomes exhausting, I think, after a little while.
[90:44.37]It's fun for us, but I don't know how fun it is for everybody else.
[90:47.40]I just want to watch the hot sauce.
[90:49.03]No one took my alien and no one gave me a kazoo.
[90:52.00]Or a duck call.
[90:54.96]It's fun with stuff like this because the first two minutes
[90:58.59]You're like, this is unbearable.
[90:59.93]This is awful.
[91:00.74]I can't listen to this.
[91:02.25]And then you kind of, wait a minute, I'm getting invested in if they're going to actually do anything.
[91:06.49]And then by the end, it's almost like, oh, fuck, man.
[91:11.19]I wanted to see what happened between those two.
[91:14.00]Oh, I almost wanted it to be like three or four more minutes.
[91:17.83]We should do an hour next year.
[91:19.91]Yeah, next year.
[91:20.75]Yeah, we should try like an hour.
[91:22.68]Oh my God.
[91:23.52]That would be unbearable.
[91:24.75]We have to go longer every year.
[91:26.47]I'm actually like completely down to do this again now that we know what this is like.
[91:31.12]I have a feeling it would be like weirdly better next time or worse.
[91:36.34]But maybe worse is better.
[91:37.66]But that's the fun of it, though, is that there's no way to know if it will be bad or good, because if...
[91:44.15]All four of us are talking at the same time, trying to desperately make a story.
[91:49.16]How do you tell a story four different times at the same time, right?
[91:52.52]When you don't know what the other person is even trying to come up with.
[91:56.06]So it could come up terribly.
[91:58.30]Or like, holy shit, that actually worked out incredibly.
[92:01.62]There's a range.
[92:03.08]of like zero to one million on the like entertainment scale.
[92:07.12]And it could absolutely be fucking zero.
[92:08.68]Right.
[92:09.69]Yeah, exactly.
[92:11.03]Exactly.
[92:11.56]I feel like there was a couple thousands, but it was very infrequent, but I enjoyed it regardless.
[92:18.08]It was great.
[92:20.01]So I knew Jordan would be on a table, not on his computer.
[92:24.97]I love how you two are like your setups here that Ster.
[92:29.81]What are you even eating in this video?
[92:32.24]What is that?
[92:33.59]The duck food.
[92:34.40]It was the whole plot.
[92:35.67]You couldn't hear me in the beginning at all.
[92:37.96]No, not really.
[92:38.65]Yeah, because unfortunately, you were sitting next to a fountain.
[92:42.96]And to turn you up, because I had to watch like snippets.
[92:48.65]Yeah, I get what you mean.
[92:50.01]Your audio was like...
[92:53.30]Did you eat the duck food?
[92:54.11]Did you actually eat the duck food?
[92:55.10]Like eat it for real?
[92:55.70]It's peanuts, right?
[92:57.62]No, it was granola.
[92:59.19]Oh yeah, that's what I feed them.
[93:00.52]I feed them like oats and stuff.
[93:02.13]No, I had actual duck food, but then I ate granola.
[93:05.12]But it was plot-wise...
[93:06.65]I ate the duck food but now I'm ruining the movie magic it was duck food that's all everybody needs to know yeah because the green screen pilgrims
[93:17.01]Yes.
[93:18.13]Oh, cool.
[93:19.73]Cool.
[93:20.84]I got mogged.
[93:22.57]I had a blast.
[93:24.27]That was a lot of fun.
[93:25.60]Thank you for doing that, by the way, because I know that it was like, why are we doing this?
[93:32.05]And I did say if it sucked.
[93:33.05]I would do that again in a heartbeat.
[93:34.10]I said if it sucked, I would take 100% of the blame.
[93:36.19]I will take all the blame if it was not good.
[93:39.96]So whether you did it or didn't like it...
[93:42.58]And if you think it was good, Jerma gets all the praise.
[93:48.42]I would seriously do that again.
[93:50.97]Let's do it again, either next year or whenever.
[93:53.76]Like, I'm down.
[93:55.25]Yeah, feel ready for it.
[93:57.06]Yeah, now we're ready.
[93:58.16]Even though people know the gag, I still think it could be really funny.
[94:01.40]I just thought it would be fun.
[94:02.34]I think a year is good.
[94:04.38]Sure.
[94:05.49]Alright.
[94:07.10]You guys want to play that RV driving video game?
[94:10.79]oh wait wait the rec game is just done now you're still you're still in the game now I'm not okay
[94:19.79]Yeah, let's do it.
[94:20.73]RV there yet?
[94:25.18]Nice.
[94:26.98]I feel like we've wanted to play this one for a while.
[94:28.25]I've heard real good things about this game.
[94:30.02]Yeah, this one apparently is really good.
[94:34.12]But yeah, again, that was a lot of fun.
[94:35.97]I'm glad it worked.
[94:37.30]I'm glad it was fun in parts.
[94:39.07]I'm glad it was a fun experiment.
[94:40.27]it was low effort too honestly it was hard to not watch it I'll be honest it sucked not watching it I know
[94:46.03]Yeah, I was really curious.
[94:47.45]But you know what, Ster?
[94:48.32]You had some effort going to the park.
[94:51.01]You had a duck plot line.
[94:52.25]I respect the effort.
[94:53.54]But for me, it was just, you know, I was gonna eat anyway.
[94:57.19]So it worked out great.
[94:58.90]It was a really low effort thing for me.
[95:00.85]I told Jerma I woke up at 6 30 to go to the duck pond early and then I didn't actually eat real food until like 3 p.m
[95:10.73]Yeah, you said you woke up specifically to make that and then you waited to eat for like
[95:17.10]like I don't know I don't know what I was doing I my big mac was ruined by the sauce oh am I like oh really you don't like hot sauce I like hot sauce but I put way too much on it oh yeah
[95:28.93]My stream just crashed.
[95:31.10]Well, not my stream, but my like audio input thing.
[95:34.18]Hold on.
[95:36.20]My audio input thing.
[95:38.08]Do you guys like the face filter?
[95:41.23]Yes.
[95:41.65]Yeah, that was very disgusting.
[95:43.42]I enjoyed it a lot.
[95:45.34]They were at least three or four times where I was laughing my ass off.
[95:48.18]If you buy a Chinese webcam, they come with filters.
[95:52.22]What's up, Jerm?
[95:53.21]There was at least three or four times where I was just laughing my ass off.
[95:56.49]Especially because, Polk, you were very defensive.
[95:59.25]it was like you were always on the defensive and it worked like half the time it was so funny I would like there were
[96:17.88]and one of them is pokes report cards yeah I was thinking they're gonna they're gonna me over here let's go we had report
[96:25.83]card sports which two things you know that's quick and then the rest was just Thanksgiving I don't even think about that damn okay
[96:36.09]Uh-huh.
