[00:01.49]Hey.
[00:04.28]How are you?
[00:07.82]Cool.
[00:10.40]Okay.
[00:11.74]What about the rest of you?
[00:14.55]There's a few of you that didn't say anything.
[00:16.49]Okay.
[00:24.36]Welcome back.
[00:28.82]Do I like that?
[00:29.94]I don't even know what that is.
[00:31.00]I don't know what the latest meme encyclopedia I have to look up.
[00:34.16]I don't know what that is.
[00:36.16]So I'm not gonna read it.
[00:43.72]Garden Flipper tonight.
[00:45.04]Like yesterday.
[00:47.64]We're back at it again.
[00:50.92]This time... It's a little different.
[00:54.01]Because this time...
[00:58.19]They changed over we're on static IP and we did a got a new DNS server, so I don't know How this one will turn out?
[01:12.08]It might not do anything I was testing for the last hour and a half or so just streaming to the Test server and it was okay It was okay
[01:26.16]I'm gonna hold my breath on this, though.
[01:30.34]Because I'm so used to the last week straight of it being all over the place.
[01:37.47]It's probably not gonna do anything.
[01:41.23]But I dropped like 1%, like 2% of frames when I was doing the test.
[01:47.31]Which is not great, but it's not terrible either.
[01:54.51]Am I on the sleep deprivation drug again?
[01:58.05]No, not really.
[02:05.11]Not today, although I haven't been getting much sleep.
[02:08.71]I don't know what it is.
[02:11.52]Maybe I'm going through like... I don't know, what's the thing you go through when you get older?
[02:17.54]Menopause, right?
[02:24.69]Oh, maybe it's that.
[02:34.43]Man, oh, pause.
[02:38.02]No, but I'm honestly just sitting here for a few minutes just to take a look.
[02:43.58]And we look pretty clean.
[02:45.52]I got the green light.
[02:46.84]Green means go.
[02:49.08]Red means stop.
[02:52.34]Yellow means...
[02:54.38]I don't know what to do.
[02:54.94]I don't know what to do.
[02:55.68]Should I go really fast or should I hit the fucking brakes?
[03:07.20]Uh, so.
[03:10.29]We're gonna go.
[03:18.47]We got green.
[03:20.23]I scared your dog.
[03:22.17]Hey, turn me up a little bit.
[03:23.55]Turn the volume up a little.
[03:25.37]I'll make it right.
[03:27.03]I'm probably on your television set.
[03:29.61]Turn me up.
[03:33.67]Hey, who's that?
[03:35.27]Who's that good dog?
[03:36.35]Are you a good dog?
[03:37.77]Yes, you are.
[03:38.68]You are such a good dog.
[03:41.08]Are you a good dog?
[03:41.90]Yes.
[03:42.12]Okay, you can turn me down.
[03:49.38]You can lower the volume now.
[03:56.90]Let me get this on the screen.
[03:58.22]Hey, that's where we were.
[04:02.81]Your dog didn't react.
[04:04.89]That's impossible.
[04:07.43]I don't believe that.
[04:08.63]Every dog reacts to that.
[04:12.85]What is W?
[04:15.54]W, W, W, W, W?
[04:19.26]Why is everybody doing W?
[04:23.20]Oh, because of the ground.
[04:24.34]Right.
[04:24.74]Right.
[04:27.16]Oh, because of the ground.
[04:28.28]Right.
[04:30.40]Like I always am.
[04:31.76]Right.
[04:32.26]Okay.
[04:32.76]Right.
[04:34.92]Right.
[04:37.61]So, today, I kind of want to do something real quick.
[04:40.05]I just want to go look.
[04:43.49]Yesterday, we had a... I don't know.
[04:47.39]Let me go see what... I think I kind of need a clean slate here, because... Where's the one that I already... This one, right?
[04:57.37]Go to the house.
[04:58.51]House price, $74,000.
[05:02.36]I've spent $6,500 on renovation in 36... How bad is this place?
[05:06.96]Oh, we got five community subs from Tori.
[05:13.08]This is cool!
[05:13.98]No, this is terrible.
[05:18.59]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:19.81]I need to do a little walkthrough here.
[05:22.17]Thank you for the five community subs, ToriT.
[05:25.15]Um...
[05:29.81]This is not... This is terrible.
[05:31.41]This is not right.
[05:38.70]What was wrong with me last night?
[05:55.00]This is, like, what happens when you give insects drugs.
[05:59.08]Wasn't there a video where they gave, like, a spider, like, crack?
[06:05.21]I am the crack spider, or, like, the fucking cocaine spider.
[06:14.53]Uh, Jeff, thank you for the five community subs, Jeff.
[06:18.14]I had a big playground.
[06:19.22]This place... Alright, this place... I don't want to do this one anymore.
[06:23.26]This is horrible.
[06:28.54]I don't want to do this house.
[06:30.22]I, in fact, want to get rid of this house.
[06:32.02]I don't want this one.
[06:38.55]I was on, like, drugs last night.
[06:40.31]I was on sleep drugs.
[06:44.17]None of this works.
[06:45.45]I hate all of this.
[06:46.17]It's making me feel bad.
[06:52.36]Finish this house.
[06:54.10]Finish the oven.
[06:55.12]Oh yeah, it was supposed to be an oven.
[06:57.76]Um...
[07:00.53]Can I not do this?
[07:02.13]I don't think I want to flip this one.
[07:03.51]I want to start over.
[07:07.46]This place sucks.
[07:09.42]I'm selling it.
[07:14.12]The yard looks alright.
[07:19.60]Restart this house?
[07:21.39]No, no.
[07:21.99]I'll come back to it.
[07:22.69]I'll come back to it.
[07:26.65]I don't like really anything about this.
[07:35.38]American Crop English Modern.
[07:39.12]English.
[07:42.35]It has a free, raw layout.
[07:44.29]Flower boughs with blooming, colorful perennials.
[07:48.19]And naturally shaped bushes are dominating.
[07:50.39]Yeah, this is pretty natural.
[07:52.23]Romantic corners don't have any of that.
[07:53.63]What about... These are crops.
[07:54.93]I mean, this is pretty... This is...
[08:02.04]No equipment, but excellent.
[08:03.60]A lot of plants, various surfaces, cleanliness, mown grass.
[08:07.08]Alright.
[08:10.36]So I got a 3% bump on my offers.
[08:12.98]Alright, I hate this place.
[08:16.39]I don't want anything to do with it.
[08:18.97]No, no, no, no.
[08:19.61]I like this place.
[08:20.37]I kind of want to keep it.
[08:21.69]I'll keep it for now.
[08:22.55]I'm not going to keep it.
[08:36.27]I want to start over, and I want to do it right.
[08:41.27]Browser... I got tons of money, who cares.
[08:45.25]I just bought a house, half-flipped it, and then walked out the front door, turned around and went, who cares.
[08:56.97]Almost only a garden, okay.
[09:02.08]New house or you're going to lose your gamer license.
[09:04.16]I'll take care of it.
[09:04.96]This is the one... This place is... Look at this place.
[09:07.64]This place is bad.
[09:08.53]$183,000.
[09:09.19]The Home Alone house is $400,000, guys.
[09:09.91]This is a lot of money.
[09:15.75]But there's no garden in the Home Alone house.
[09:33.80]How do I even... This is just a regular house.
[09:36.56]This doesn't need to be flipped.
[09:48.13]I hope that wasn't a mistake.
[09:49.19]I don't have any money left.
[10:00.74]None of this is garden stuff.
[10:08.76]All I need to say is that a movie was filmed here.
[10:11.56]And the price already went up.
[10:12.64]Can I say that?
[10:17.92]Be careful.
[10:20.09]Is it trapped still?
[10:26.95]Oh, I can just sell this stuff.
[10:34.47]It's not a movie, Jeremiah.
[10:35.59]It's real.
[10:41.59]I just wasted a bunch of money.
[10:44.05]I'll probably just get it right back.
[10:45.65]Okay, this is going to be a real flip job.
[10:49.21]Holy fuck, that's 800 bucks.
[10:50.36]Alright.
[10:51.80]Let's start here.
[10:56.66]This is already done.
[10:57.48]This house is already made.
[11:05.48]Look at the Christmas tree.
[11:06.44]This is not a House Flipper.
[11:09.35]This house was flipped before I got here.
[11:12.98]Maybe a fuse is blown.
[11:20.90]I'm just like... I'm just cleaning up this way.
[11:24.18]I have to do that with every single one of these.
[11:25.55]Yeah, the fuse is probably in the garage.
[11:32.77]I'll take care of it.
[11:33.39]Just let home on.
[11:36.31]I'm busy.
[11:42.21]I think I'm replacing LEDs with the internal mechanical lights.
[11:50.08]Why would you replace LEDs?
[12:05.99]Watch out!
[12:06.87]Nothing's gonna happen!
[12:11.89]There's no traps.
[12:13.89]Nothing's gonna happen.
[12:17.75]Oh, look out!
[12:18.31]Whoa!
[12:20.09]A paint can just hit me right in the fucking mouth!
[12:34.22]Yeah, this is... It could be... This is not dirty.
[12:37.24]So much trash here.
[12:38.28]No, this is not.
[12:40.63]This is what you think trash looks like?
[12:44.37]You need to come to my house.
[12:50.36]I mean, whoa.
[12:52.44]Whoa, it's a lot.
[13:04.21]Dirt?
[13:04.53]No, I'm actually pretty clean.
[13:07.79]I'm a pretty clean individual.
[13:16.87]There's three people living here?
[13:19.87]Yeah, we've got our own domains.
[13:25.03]Okay, somebody tell me.
[13:26.26]Give me the TL;DR here.
[13:27.68]Was there a reason for me to purchase this house?
[13:33.12]Are you guys waiting for the oil to be on the ground and for me to slip and break my neck?
[13:37.68]Is that what's going on?
[13:43.23]I don't think you're going to get it.
[13:44.53]I'm fairly certain you're not going to get it.
[13:52.71]I open up this button, and it's just crossbow shoots down the hall, right by my face.
[14:03.98]Oh, this is done.
[14:04.56]That looks fine.
[14:08.63]Yeah, I think it's clean.
[14:09.59]This house is clean.
[14:15.41]How do you flip a house that's already done?
[14:19.17]Maybe a fuse is blown.
[14:20.29]Yeah, I'm gonna go look for that.
[14:21.31]Hold on, there's like trash over here.
[14:25.84]What's behind the tree?
[14:26.70]Oh, just glass.
[14:28.80]Alright, let's go turn it all on.
[14:35.24]There's probably a fuse blown.
[14:41.41]Probably.
[14:45.75]Press E. Alright, stick it back in.
[14:59.53]E!
[15:00.20]E!
[15:01.46]Can you play the piano?
[15:03.88]Alright, so that's fine.
[15:04.76]Everything's good.
[15:05.34]Just have to turn the fuse on.
[15:06.36]And then is it gonna turn into like a clown show in here?
[15:14.12]What is all this?
[15:15.49]Oh.
[15:16.07]What?
[15:16.21]Isn't there a basement in this movie?
[15:22.77]There's the kitchen.
[15:25.81]Anything with the knives?
[15:27.17]Nothin'?
[15:29.66]Pizza.
[15:34.16]No, it's just a little bit of trash.
[15:35.46]Not a big deal at all.
[15:36.20]This ain't a big deal.
[15:48.31]This is viscera cleanup detail.
[15:50.81]It is like viscera.
[15:51.95]There's only one difference.
[15:53.95]You can plant trees.
[15:56.27]And you can buy furniture.
[15:59.97]It's very similar, but also different at the same time.
[16:02.35]Alright.
[16:06.07]Dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose.
[16:08.81]Everything's clean out here.
[16:09.73]Is this snow?
[16:13.49]Alright, well, I gotta go down.
[16:18.25]This is the garage, right?
[16:22.87]Destroy this house.
[16:25.03]Let me just get to the gotcha moment.
[16:30.20]There will be a gotcha here, and everyone will scream.
[16:35.06]Let's find it.
[16:35.72]Here's the fuse box.
[16:36.52]Alright, hold on.
[16:41.75]It was possible that something was going to run down the stairs at me.
[16:49.93]This one's broken, this one's nice and fixed.
[16:52.45]Turn it on.
[16:52.93]Alright, now we have power.
[16:54.23]Ooh, wait a minute.
[17:11.99]Dead?
[17:12.87]No, very much alive.
[17:14.19]What?
[17:15.59]Why do I have this in the house?
[17:16.50]Alright, let's turn on the Christmas tree so everyone can laugh.
[17:28.43]Alright.
[17:31.07]Can I have my money back?
[17:32.09]I want a refund on the house.
[17:33.31]Can you do that?
[17:33.87]Can you do a refund if you buy a house?
[17:41.17]You get 30 days to see if you want it or not.
[17:47.46]Yeah, I'd like to return a house, please.
[17:54.06]Reason for the return?
[17:56.24]Ah, I just... No, I'm not feeling it.
[17:57.50]You guys have that 30-day policy, so I'll try another one.
[18:04.03]Imagine getting a free trial house.
[18:06.57]You get 30 days to... Why don't they treat houses like they treat mattresses?
[18:14.74]You know, you can sleep on a mattress for fucking, like, three months, and then you can just, if you don't want it anymore, you can send it back.
[18:28.05]Alright, let's, what am I, can I please at least get, I just cleaned it up a little.
[18:32.87]Nobody does that?
[18:33.59]No, I know nobody does that, but, like, look at all, every mattress you could ever purchase.
[18:42.20]They do like 180 days, like 200 days some of them.
[18:44.92]Some of them do a year.
[18:46.10]Why?
[18:51.54]The smooth family.
[18:53.26]Alright, I made a profit.
[18:57.76]$66,000 profit.
[19:03.14]Positive options, negative options.
[19:04.86]Okay.
[19:06.98]I'm going to accept.
[19:07.70]Let's negotiate.
[19:15.15]I mean, come on, this movie, this was made, this was used in a movie.
[19:17.47]30,000?
[19:27.02]More?
[19:27.30]What do you mean increase?
[19:29.98]No, just $30,000 is enough.
[19:38.51]Why is everybody saying increase, increase, increase?
[19:41.37]They're gonna...
[19:49.65]Alright, you guys are right.
[19:50.43]Okay.
[19:52.93]Sure, I will take the extra $49,000.
[19:56.85]Literally scammed those people.
[19:58.09]Yes.
[20:17.64]500,000 and still living here.
[20:19.70]I get 600 grand.
[20:24.38]Yeah, I pretend... I'm one of those people that I... I'm like the guy down the street that doesn't ever buy anything, but he just sees a secret millionaire.
[20:33.22]Didn't they, like, do a show about, like, the millionaire?
[20:36.22]Like, Millionaires in the Shadows, whatever it was called, or, like, The Secret Life of the Millionaire.
[20:40.80]They've done it before.
[20:44.72]He should have re-booby-trapped that house.
[20:49.52]Alright, now let's go for real.
[20:51.00]That was just a teaser for you.
[20:52.50]And that was a teaser for the internet being actually fine.
[20:55.30]Well, alright.
[20:57.11]I'm not gonna hold my breath.
[21:00.55]We got this piece of crap, but I don't wanna do that one.
[21:05.19]This is... Here's the big one.
[21:07.49]This is the big one.
[21:13.54]The pizza oven house is... I'm just... I'm sorry.
[21:16.40]That's just gonna have to sit on the shelf.
[21:20.58]That thing sucks.
[21:22.58]I had no vision there.
[21:23.56]I was just, like, drunk.
[21:26.38]I was just sleep drunk.
[21:31.04]At least sell it.
[21:31.86]I will!
[21:32.28]I'm gonna clean it up.
[21:34.58]But this is the big one here.
[21:39.42]Do the nuclear house.
[21:46.39]He didn't read the asshole part.
[21:49.12]What?
[21:49.38]Yeah, because I... What do you mean?
[21:50.56]What are you talking about?
[21:52.12]I'm going to do this one.
[21:53.08]We've got Garden Flipper.
[21:54.24]I'm going to make a good garden.
[21:55.42]I'm going to make an actual really nice one.
[21:59.66]A large house with a separate garage for two cars in raw condition.
[22:02.67]I will sell it right away.
[22:05.17]Two floors.
[22:06.35]This is a big one.
[22:09.19]I'm going for it.
[22:09.81]I just made this.
[22:10.67]Let's see how bad this is.
[22:19.63]A mole has nestled in the neighborhood.
[22:21.37]Use a shovel to bury all mounds of ground.
[22:23.99]A mischievous mole will create new ones until you find him.
[22:31.30]Oh my god.
[22:32.00]Dude, imagine living across the street to this.
[22:41.84]You know, we were really thinking about selling in a year or two, but, uh... Our property value...
[22:50.52]Can you at least get rid of the fucking bricks?
[22:59.93]This house probably shows up on those top 10 scary lists.
[23:06.59]Top 10 Scariest Abandoned Buildings.
[23:09.33]Top 5 Scariest Things Caught on Camera in Abandoned Houses.
[23:15.15]Eventually those people are gonna- You know, here's what you have to understand.
[23:17.69]You know those people are gonna run out of shit to make lists of, right?
[23:22.45]Eventually they're gonna have to start listing very boring things Top five types of wood to build a birdhouse Here is the top ten Cities in a one mile radius of London
[23:51.68]Top 10 towns within 5 miles of Boston.
[24:01.73]They'll have to come up with some weird shit, man.
[24:12.27]How do I get rid of them?
[24:15.71]What do I do?
[24:19.49]How do you get rid of the mole?
[24:26.77]Dude, I did like, I just tried to like spade side down, like shovel vertical on his head.
[24:36.70]Oh my god, that would have been horrendous.
[24:52.47]Why is the mall so big?
[24:53.53]I don't know.
[24:55.17]Well fed.
[24:55.70]You got plenty of trash around here.
[24:58.22]Plenty of ways for him to grow.
[25:01.90]Do I need to find him again?
[25:02.82]Alright, what's the garage look like?
[25:06.24]I have to get a vision here.
[25:07.20]This place is huge.
[25:09.99]This is a ridiculously large project.
[25:14.37]See you guys in nine hours.
[25:21.06]This is so big.
[25:30.06]Did anybody get any- I really do want screenshots though.
[25:32.44]So I'm gonna put time into this.
[25:33.34]I'm gonna make this real.
[25:34.66]You ready?
[25:37.65]Keep that in your memory.
[25:39.17]This is gonna be nice over here.
[25:49.85]Keep this part in memory too.
[25:51.01]This is gonna be a nice long path.
[25:54.53]Okay, there we go.
[25:55.29]Alright.
[25:58.03]I wanna start- should we go inside out?
[26:01.91]Or outside in.
[26:02.69]I feel like you need to go... I don't know.
[26:06.85]Where do you even start here?
[26:13.52]You have to just pick a corner and just start there.
[26:15.62]Alright, we'll start with the dumpster.
[26:18.18]We'll start with this corner first.
[26:20.34]And I'm going to get this corner to the way that I like it.
[26:24.70]We're going to do a nice little garden here in the corner.
[26:32.85]Right here.
[26:33.65]We're gonna do, like, reds, purples.
[26:35.39]Get these weeds.
[26:43.30]I have the weed whacker, too.
[26:45.46]Where is it?
[26:45.80]Right here.
[26:49.06]We're gonna get some nice grass.
[26:50.46]I'm not gonna fuck around on this one.
[26:52.14]We do have a tree here, though, which ruins everything.
[26:56.73]I have to put down new grass.
[27:03.58]Can you add water features?
[27:05.07]I'm actually not sure.
[27:06.15]That's a good question.
[27:11.45]Okay.
[27:12.55]Let's get this out of here.
[27:13.57]Move it all.
[27:16.59]I got a vision.
[27:25.06]I don't want to turn around either.
[27:26.82]Because the second I turn around, all bets are off.
[27:29.50]Because it's like looking down when you're at a really high height.
[27:35.63]I'll fall off.
[27:37.85]I'm just going for this quadrant right here first.
[27:47.20]He's sputterwalking again.
[27:48.78]It's gonna happen, okay?
[27:50.22]That's just gonna happen.
[27:51.38]Alright, don't bite off more than you can chew.
[27:53.78]Just easily, easy, easy, easy.
[28:01.32]Okay, let me go back here.
[28:02.70]I'm not supposed to turn around.
[28:14.39]Alright, that looks alright.
[28:15.74]Just this side.
[28:16.28]We'll lay the grass down.
[28:17.82]I'll measure it.
[28:18.30]I'll get the tape measurer.
[28:29.44]Spudder walking champion.
[28:32.05]Hey, I'm gonna... Look, I'm doing my garden the way that I want to do my garden.
[28:37.77]You want to do your garden the way you want to do your garden?
[28:39.83]Get some tools.
[28:42.55]And get out here.
[28:50.45]Alright, I'm almost ready to start this section.
[28:56.86]New gardener skill.
[28:58.02]Thank God.
[29:00.28]I can't... Should I not even press this?
[29:04.82]Is the text coming soon, or is the tool coming soon?
[29:08.88]Why would it be... I don't know.
[29:15.75]Visible moles?
[29:17.93]100% faster unfolding grass.
[29:19.70]That's a big one.
[29:20.38]I'm doing this one.
[29:34.49]You're guarding like my grandma.
[29:38.13]I can't name you anybody else that gardens.
[29:40.39]I...
[29:51.15]I just, all the gardeners that I know are over 50.
[29:58.82]That like plants and garden, they're all like 55.
[30:01.06]I don't know anybody personally that gardens.
[30:08.67]My grandmother used to garden.
[30:10.37]My mother gardens.
[30:14.13]A neighbor I had before was a gardener.
[30:16.37]Like, really into it.
[30:17.23]Not like a... Wait, hold on, there's a difference.
[30:19.42]Between, like, a professional gardener and, like, you go outside and you plant plants and stuff.
[30:36.28]Are we talking, like, hobby gardening?
[30:37.58]Or are we talking, like, you pay me a thousand dollars and I make your outside of your house look nice?
[30:47.37]Like a professional gardener.
[30:48.39]Oh, there's plenty of them, yeah.
[31:00.02]Wait, when did I say that hobby gardening was invalid?
[31:02.60]I didn't say that.
[31:04.96]I said the gardeners that I know are all older.
[31:09.14]Like my mother and her friends and stuff.
[31:13.23]When did I immediately follow that up going, they're invalid.
[31:15.27]They're invalid.
[31:29.71]You should know more gardeners.
[31:31.49]I'm sorry, I don't know very many gardeners.
[31:34.33]I'm not supposed to be over here.
[31:45.86]I'm not supposed to be over there yet.
[31:55.52]Dumb streamer doesn't even know 10 gardeners.
[31:59.62]I don't think I know 10 of anything.
[32:02.74]I don't know 10 plumbers.
[32:04.44]I don't know 10 firefighters.
[32:06.64]I don't know 10 gardeners.
[32:11.87]I... I know 10, like, different people that do different things.
[32:17.59]I don't think I know 10 people that do the same thing.
[32:28.05]Is there more than just this one?
[32:29.39]Let's see.
[32:31.26]Rug grass.
[32:33.32]No.
[32:36.96]Big turf roll.
[32:37.62]Let's get this right.
[32:43.75]Top 10.
[32:47.97]Top 10 workers.
[32:49.51]This is going to screw me over here, though.
[32:52.13]The tree being in the way.
[32:55.79]I'm gonna start here, go out.
[32:57.84]I can patch that one up.
[33:03.28]I'm just gonna get it to here.
[33:04.52]This is gonna be my line here, for now.
[33:07.00]This corner.
[33:12.64]Yeah, I can't... I can't name you 10 of any profession that I know.
[33:17.80]Okay, that's all good.
[33:25.38]Or any hobby, or whatever.
[33:28.04]Streamers?
[33:29.56]That I know.
[33:30.12]That I, like, personally know them.
[33:34.74]Maybe, like, six?
[33:35.84]I... I don't... I mean... I think you guys are severely overestimating the amount of people that you may know that do a certain thing.
[33:59.52]That's as close as I can get it.
[34:00.54]Let me just make sure this is going to work.
[34:10.07]You can't lay turf on this surface.
[34:12.09]Why not?
[34:16.16]Is it because this grass has to be cut first?
[34:27.81]That can't be why, right?
[34:29.51]Can I really not lay it here?
[34:35.87]What?
[34:39.71]Can't lay turf on this surface.
[34:44.40]Wait, what the?
[34:45.32]Okay, that was weird.
[34:48.98]Oh, there's a fork on the ground!
[35:00.76]Alright, let's see if this rolls out.
[35:01.96]How fast it goes.
[35:04.75]Come on!
[35:05.47]Come on!
[35:06.25]Why?
[35:06.61]Like, it's... That's perfect.
[35:09.09]That roll's not even there.
[35:15.65]I'm not enjoying the hitboxes on these.
[35:17.80]Because you're always going to have fucked up lines.
[35:21.16]Always.
[35:21.58]I can't ever put something here.
[35:23.50]Never.
[35:23.72]Alright, I didn't... I got the hammer out of...
[35:31.49]Accident.
[35:37.16]Like, I can put it here.
[35:38.62]This is going to look so shitty now.
[35:47.94]So apparently it can't go here.
[35:49.84]It can only go here.
[35:52.07]So I've got to line it up.
[35:57.15]Can't go there.
[35:57.63]It can go here.
[35:58.33]Alright.
[36:03.04]Right there.
[36:04.68]Right here.
[36:05.20]Let's see if that fixes it.
[36:09.68]Yeah.
[36:11.16]That's kind of annoying.
[36:12.00]Yeah, because I will forever have this.
[36:25.32]I can never lay any grass there.
[36:31.68]It's ruined.
[36:32.43]It's beyond repair.
[36:33.31]Yeah, I know.
[36:41.93]Look, this is not going to be grass.
[36:44.99]But, I mean, look.
[36:46.06]I can... This is going to be grass.
[36:48.72]This is going to be grass.
[36:49.74]That's going to be... I'm trying to save my rolls here.
[37:07.80]That should overlap enough to give me no line.
[37:14.51]Just knock the fence down if you could.
[37:17.21]You can't.
[37:26.34]Receding grass line.
[37:47.79]Alright, might as well move this trash out of the way.
[37:54.66]Cut, cut, cut.
[37:58.50]Nice and clean.
[37:59.52]Alright, we're making progress.
[38:02.37]Can I stop the night cycle?
[38:05.03]I only want it to be day.
[38:08.29]Day and night mode.
[38:10.55]Real time.
[38:12.90]What time is it?
[38:15.54]It's gonna be like this forever.
[38:17.38]Alright, real time.
[38:19.25]Wait, was there another one?
[38:19.93]What was the other one?
[38:21.81]Game time.
[38:23.59]Disabled.
[38:27.21]Got it.
[38:31.11]Alright, this is good.
[38:32.19]I want to work out in the garden.
[38:34.01]I don't want to go through day and night cycles.
[38:35.45]It's easier to see.
[38:42.57]My immersion.
[38:43.27]No one's going to be out here at 4 o'clock in the morning doing gardening stuff.
[38:48.59]Alright, yeah, and oh, Jeremy makes another generalization about the gardeners.
[38:59.34]Apparently, according to Jeremy, they're all old ladies and they only work in the day.
[39:07.48]He's a monster.
[39:08.36]Did you hear what he said?
[39:13.10]That's not what I said!
[39:27.49]Alright, look at it.
[39:28.21]Look how much better this is looking than last time.
[39:34.91]Now, here's the problem here.
[39:36.75]This is gonna be an issue.
[39:39.88]alright hold on let me line it up line it up line it up alright no no no no which one was it this one it's like moving around stop moving around
[40:12.41]No!
[40:12.85]What am I fucking bumping into?
[40:14.33]Oh my god.
[40:15.15]Yeah, this is causing collision.
[40:18.43]You would just stomp on this.
[40:29.74]Anybody want a glass of wine?
[40:33.78]What do you think?
[40:35.32]Anyone want some wine?
[40:49.01]Why are you doing that?
[40:50.43]Look it, look it.
[40:52.01]What am I bumping into?
[40:52.89]Alright, I'm just putting it down.
[40:55.83]Fuck it, I'm putting it down.
[41:02.35]Gardening is a dumb pro- I'm just kidding.
[41:13.78]What if I just went off on gardeners?
[41:16.24]I don't like gardening.
[41:17.24]I don't like it at all.
[41:17.88]I think it's stupid.
[41:30.87]It looks nice.
[41:33.33]No, I will tell you, you know, gardening takes a considerable amount of skill.
[41:38.52]That's one reason why I know this.
[41:41.38]I used to help my grandmother do it.
[41:43.50]Oh, there he goes again!
[41:44.38]I used to help my grandmother do it, and I would be trying to, even just something as simple as...
[41:54.52]Planting.
[41:55.30]Actually getting the soil ready and then planting.
[41:57.69]It's hard to do that.
[41:58.35]It has to be the right consistency.
[42:00.89]It has to really hold it up.
[42:02.07]It's going to be... Because you can really make it look like crap.
[42:10.06]Let's get this here.
[42:13.94]And... I don't know how... No, I'm just going to do them one at a time.
[42:16.38]That was a nice story.
[42:25.18]Nice story.
[42:26.86]Yeah.
[42:27.98]Let me tell you something, guys.
[42:28.95]Gardening is difficult to do, and here's why.
[42:32.15]The soil, you know, you've got to get it in the... You've got to get... It can fall over in the soil.
[42:38.88]That's it.
[42:39.68]That's the whole story.
[42:52.38]Alright.
[43:03.36]Again, don't look behind me.
[43:04.34]I mean, you can, but I don't want anyone else to.
[43:09.83]This is going to go straight up all the way.
[43:17.61]Behind me.
[43:17.91]Don't look behind you.
[43:21.25]in this game.
[43:21.95]I don't know what's going on in your real life, but in the video game we're trying to keep a positive attitude towards our house.
[43:31.58]No lines?
[43:32.66]I've gotten pretty good at that.
[43:42.51]So what the hell?
[43:43.09]Why couldn't I do this yesterday?
[43:48.15]I was like freaking out yesterday.
[43:54.06]Using the big roll.
[43:55.00]Yeah.
[43:57.61]Because I got a big roll.
[44:00.97]You know how many stacks I got?
[44:02.27]I got like hundreds rolled up here.
[44:03.61]I have so many hundreds rolled up like this that I'm bringing to the bank in rubber bands.
[44:19.98]They're going to get like two managers over to help.
[44:28.86]Okay, let's not get too overzealous over here.
[44:31.50]Not yet.
[44:34.69]You flaunting your money?
[44:39.29]No.
[44:41.53]I don't think so.
[44:44.25]How do you... I gotta deposit it somehow.
[44:56.75]My Chad aura is growing.
[45:10.44]Damn, you're still rolling grass from yesterday.
[45:13.32]Yeah, it takes a long time.
[45:17.74]I haven't gone to sleep.
[45:22.82]Let's just get it like this.
[45:32.39]They get nice and clean.
[45:37.09]Right.
[45:37.53]No, that's gonna get blocked.
[45:39.85]That is not gonna get blocked.
[45:41.75]Use those surgery FPS hands.
[45:45.15]There you go.
[45:45.71]Alright, we got one more little slab here.
[45:52.15]What's going on here?
[45:52.81]Is there a line?
[45:56.07]What is this?
[45:56.51]There's a line here.
[45:59.49]What's this line?
[46:09.66]Uh, did I tell you guys that I'm really into sardines lately?
[46:12.31]I don't think we had that conversation.
[46:21.27]Yeah, I'm really into it.
[46:22.09]Yeah, we can get a little roll here.
[46:31.58]A small, little small one.
[46:33.00]I just want to get this vine.
[46:37.04]Is that going to get the whole vine?
[46:45.25]Is that getting it?
[46:51.35]No, what is this line?
[46:53.14]This is pissing me off.
[46:54.28]What's going on here?
[47:07.13]Oh, oh, what is this?
[47:24.67]Oh, no.
[47:27.27]Is it... It's a shadow?
[47:28.71]No, like, clearly look in there.
[47:29.89]You can see the ground.
[47:31.87]Like, right here.
[47:36.18]That's it.
[47:36.50]That's clearly grass.
[47:42.12]That's not a shadow.
[47:45.24]That's not a shadow.
[47:46.10]There's a bump here.
[47:52.87]That's not a shadow.
[47:53.69]Look right there.
[48:01.11]Anyways.
[48:01.37]Oh, yeah.
[48:01.81]Sardines.
[48:02.23]They're pretty good.
[48:05.29]I've been mashing them up and then putting it on toast.
[48:08.95]It's pretty damn good.
[48:11.91]Really good for you, too.
[48:17.43]No, that's not a shadow.
[48:20.29]Get this off.
[48:23.39]Disgusting.
[48:25.59]Why not just buy tuna?
[48:26.53]Because...
[48:28.82]Sardines have more selenium.
[48:31.75]And they're also not a predatory fish, so they don't have as much Mercury.
[48:39.70]Welcome to the School of Jerma!
[48:57.84]I thought you made that up.
[48:58.94]No.
[49:01.24]Welcome to gardening school.
[49:03.27]First things first, welcome to gardening school.
[49:05.09]Put your tools away.
[49:06.45]Everybody put your fucking tools away.
[49:09.69]Who ate sardines this morning?
[49:11.03]Raise your hands.
[49:12.92]None of you?
[49:13.84]None of you?
[49:14.26]How old are you guys?
[49:15.90]Everybody in the room is over 55.
[49:19.54]Grandma Tilly, what did you have for breakfast this morning?
[49:23.39]Well, before I planted my macadamias, I had a small two-egg.
[49:30.92]Wrong!
[49:32.46]Wrong!
[49:34.54]Oh!
[49:49.76]I want all of you to go home and I want you to eat sardines for breakfast tomorrow.
[49:53.86]All of you.
[49:55.64]Yeah, what is it?
[49:56.60]What is it, Edna?
[49:58.28]I am allergic to sardines!
[50:01.70]Do it anyways!
[50:03.52]Oh!
[50:12.97]Later that evening, Jerma985 was arrested for having a fake gardener's license and yelling at old people to eat things that they are allergic to.
[50:33.47]That was the P.T.?
[50:34.97]No, that wasn't P.T.
[50:41.88]That's not a shadow.
[50:42.76]Look at that.
[50:43.18]Oh, that's a shadow?
[50:45.10]Bullshit.
[50:46.02]Give me a break.
[50:49.86]Dermot, you're dumb.
[50:51.22]It's a shadow.
[50:52.06]That's not a shadow.
[50:54.52]That's like bird feathers.
[51:00.88]Zoom in on that.
[51:05.19]This is a shadow.
[51:06.07]I can see this clearly.
[51:07.91]These are, like, bird feathers.
[51:09.77]It's alright.
[51:10.15]It looks fine.
[51:26.78]Ugh.
[51:27.62]Ugh.
[51:30.56]Can we use green carpet on the lines?
[51:39.63]I think we're almost done.
[51:40.39]This is starting to look a little better.
[51:47.55]There's one piece... This is where I got all messed up yesterday.
[51:51.89]Yesterday, I was just going like this.
[51:58.94]Um... Dig over here.
[52:02.28]What should I do back here?
[52:03.16]Do the plant.
[52:04.72]No.
[52:04.86]No.
[52:06.43]So what's your vision?
[52:07.15]Where's the purple?
[52:07.79]Just hold on.
[52:09.25]I have it all up here, and I'm gonna do it slow.
[52:12.51]We're gonna be here for the next, like, 6 to 12 hours.
[52:29.40]I'm gonna go eat some sardines.
[52:37.92]Marathon gardening.
[52:38.80]Do you have to water the grass?
[52:41.34]Probably not.
[52:45.54]Alright, so let me... This is my vision here.
[52:49.99]My vision is to have... I think I want... Don't do anything yet.
[52:55.43]I need to block it out.
[52:58.33]I don't like these trees being in the way.
[53:01.03]I'm thinking... They're like descending.
[53:06.72]Hmm.
[53:09.20]Can I build... Hold on, man.
[53:13.00]Surfaces.
[53:13.48]Can I, like, go up?
[53:14.88]Can I build, like, up?
[53:22.38]Paving slabs.
[53:25.20]Hmm.
[53:30.99]Do mini golf.
[53:32.19]No.
[53:33.97]Have a mini golf course.
[53:38.53]What a dumb house.
[53:41.13]What a stupid house.
[53:43.83]You're the guy with the mini golf course in his house.
[53:48.56]Should there be mini golf in the house too?
[53:50.60]Should there just be one?
[53:51.74]No, you don't.
[53:52.44]This is what happened last time.
[53:54.50]Last time I was doing this, it was like, oh, what about like a pizza oven?
[53:58.66]Yeah, pizza oven.
[53:59.55]Let's make the whole house a pizza oven.
[54:10.88]Let me fix this.
[54:17.38]Can we get, alright, but hold on.
[54:18.84]Can we get like the book ending and like the show ending?
[54:22.23]Can I do like the, can I do like the books first?
[54:28.59]I want, I want to do like a garden over here.
[54:30.49]They're going to be like two, you're going to see like, can we do like a Fullmetal Alchemist here?
[54:42.50]There'll be two shows.
[54:43.42]Alright, everyone's getting in my head.
[54:54.33]Don't let them get in your head!
[54:56.01]Don't let them get in there!
[55:04.43]I'm in.
[55:09.73]I'm in.
[55:13.35]Let's start with this.
[55:15.36]Let's do, hmm.
[55:18.58]Let's get some concrete here.
[55:19.62]Let's take a look.
[55:24.62]Stair.
[55:25.74]Ooh, let me just take a look.
[55:26.78]I need to see how this works.
[55:29.42]Oh, dumb.
[55:30.92]Hold on.
[55:40.54]So I can.
[55:41.42]Can I actually do it?
[55:44.72]Alright, I want to have like a... Okay, so I can.
[55:53.31]That'll be for like another mini golf hole.
[55:55.73]I can't fucking believe I'm doing this.
[56:02.99]I don't know if I can go that high.
[56:07.29]Okay, let's have a staircase to build up into our neighbor's yard.
[56:20.39]What could this person possibly be doing?
[56:28.68]I should put a hole in the wall over here.
[56:45.64]Ah, shit, shit, shit, hold on.
[56:54.59]Hey, Bob!
[56:58.49]What are you doing over there?
[57:00.99]What are you up to over there?
[57:05.93]Oh, nothing.
[57:09.81]Oh, that's as far as it goes.
[57:10.89]Nope, it's not.
[57:46.29]I don't think I can... I actually... Can you... Why?
[57:48.66]Is that... I have to... How am I ever going to delete all this?
[58:17.44]The game is starting to not like what I'm doing right now.
[58:25.47]See?
[58:25.99]It's really not liking this.
[58:51.59]I think I'm getting into the sky box.
[58:55.27]Hey, Bob!
[59:14.25]Hey, what are you doing up there, kid?
[59:19.13]Oh, you know.
[59:21.72]Just trying to reach God, that's all.
[59:24.22]Got a thing or two to say to him.
[59:30.19]Hey, while you're up there, see if you can get tomorrow's lottery numbers.
[59:34.45]Okay, Bob.
[59:35.05]Uh-oh.
[59:49.77]I can't.
[59:50.31]I can't go anymore.
[59:52.19]I'm not allowed.
[59:52.83]I'm at the box.
[59:58.13]Should I just make Jenga?
[59:59.17]I cannot leave this inside.
[60:02.07]Leave what inside?
[60:05.05]No, I think it thinks I'm in the house.
[60:07.19]Wait a minute.
[60:08.46]I got a new plan.
[60:15.00]Yeah, it thinks I'm inside the house.
[60:16.74]So we have to go this way.
[60:20.19]Where does it hit?
[60:21.24]Right here, okay.
[60:21.90]Ow.
[60:31.33]Uh-oh.
[60:38.23]What have I done?
[60:41.35]Am I standing on anything?
[60:50.83]Hey, it's art!
[61:04.07]Yeah, you can see it's go- I gotta, like, change that so it's not going in the house.
[61:08.55]So much for the nice garden, somebody said.
[61:10.69]Um... What you meant to say was the garden's gonna be up here.
[61:15.69]I'm making another house up here.
[61:26.55]See, this is the front.
[61:27.49]There's going to be a beautiful house up here.
[61:35.92]God damn it.
[61:44.93]I'm just selling it.
[61:45.81]It's whatever.
[61:52.27]No, I need those.
[61:52.93]I need these.
[61:53.29]I need these.
[61:53.67]I need these to get up there.
[61:55.79]Thank God.
[62:23.38]Come on, let me... I can... Hold on, I wanna see if this works.
[62:39.76]Just breaking kind of every law.
[62:57.95]This is so dumb.
[63:12.40]Uh, hey, Bob?
[63:14.52]What is it, Ted?
[63:17.75]You got a rope?
[63:22.79]Let's try and jump.
[63:30.34]No, fuck.
[63:31.86]Oh, I hate it.
[63:32.88]It can't be there.
[63:35.00]It can't be there.
[63:35.56]It can't be there.
[63:54.86]I can't leave that.
[63:55.80]It's gonna fucking drive me crazy.
[64:07.94]Alright, now how do I get rid of this one?
[64:11.50]I can't go straight up because I have to jump over here.
[64:13.68]I gotta delete this.
[64:19.62]Oh god, hold on.
[64:20.64]Wait, wait, wait.
[64:21.91]I think I can make it.
[64:22.69]Alright, so here's the plan.
[64:25.31]Shit.
[64:26.75]Oh, that's not good.
[64:27.55]I gotta go up higher than this.
[64:30.19]Wait, wait, hold on.
[64:37.20]This is not... I don't want to fuck this whole thing up.
[64:39.33]Just hold on.
[64:39.99]Relax, everybody.
[64:41.24]Just take a second.
[65:05.85]God fuck no!
[65:19.73]I have to restart this fucking whole thing.
[65:22.21]Is there any way- Oh, there has to be a way I can delete this.
[65:24.65]Why did I fucking do this?
[65:27.33]I can't reset it.
[65:28.01]No, no, no, I can do it.
[65:29.35]Oh, just get me up there slow.
[65:30.55]I'm trying to go too fast.
[65:34.04]Am I bumping into something?
[65:35.68]I'm making, like, these giant towers.
[65:38.34]Just to delete somebody.
[65:39.72]I saw one person said, leave one.
[65:41.70]And just fucked up the whole thing.
[65:50.59]I can do it.
[65:51.43]I can do this.
[65:52.17]Just wait.
[65:52.77]I can do it.
[65:54.17]I'm just gonna start going this way now.
[65:56.55]Make it clean so I can get rid of it.
[66:05.95]Okay, how far until the... There's gonna have to be a part two to that.
[66:12.54]I just wanted to make a garden.
[66:15.02]And somebody had to say mini-golf, and then my fucking clown meter went to a thousand.
[66:20.08]I was doing fine.
[66:27.58]Okay.
[66:38.29]Look at my money.
[66:44.75]Oh, no, not my money.
[66:46.47]Can I reach it?
[66:52.89]I'm not falling again.
[66:54.75]If I fall again, I will reset it.
[66:57.25]I would have to.
[66:57.81]Okay, slow.
[67:10.15]Thank God.
[67:15.03]I have to think this through.
[67:15.81]Think it through.
[67:19.73]I've got to go up?
[67:21.04]But then how do I delete these?
[67:26.06]Um... I... I think...
[67:35.11]Hold on, can I?
[67:36.88]That's not true.
[67:37.40]Can I actually do that?
[67:39.36]I'm afraid to do that.
[67:40.18]Hold on.
[67:42.16]Let me get back to where I was.
[67:43.18]I'm going to get rid of this one.
[67:48.42]I can't reach that.
[67:49.22]Fuck.
[67:53.96]I don't... I have to delete this first.
[67:55.86]I've got to... One at a time.
[67:57.44]One thing at a time.
[67:58.04]Okay, hold on.
[68:00.66]So what you're telling me... Here comes... Might be a loud noise.
[68:05.26]Loud noise potentially incoming.
[68:06.88]Turn your volume down.
[68:09.04]Nope.
[68:09.36]Doesn't do anything.
[68:10.28]I have to sell it.
[68:12.72]Okay, so the idea... Here's the idea.
[68:18.15]If I can build this... This way.
[68:21.39]A couple more.
[68:25.71]Make it clean so I can actually walk on this.
[68:32.73]The cleaner this is, the better.
[68:34.53]Because then I can actually use it.
[68:40.07]And walk backwards and delete it.
[68:44.52]Almost there.
[68:51.90]Okay.
[68:52.34]I should now be able to do this.
[68:59.97]Not yet.
[69:00.31]I need to build this one.
[69:01.27]Okay, here we go.
[69:05.47]Come on, use that brain.
[69:11.87]Okay.
[69:13.01]I did it.
[69:14.24]It's done.
[69:16.28]Now I just have to.
[69:18.54]We're gonna go down here.
[69:21.20]And then... No, which one?
[69:22.52]What do I do first?
[69:25.46]I've made... Yeah, I've made this a puzzle game.
[69:30.41]I have to start over here.
[69:34.05]Don't fall off.
[69:39.55]Falling off ruins.
[69:41.08]If I fall now, it's fucked.
[69:42.98]The whole thing.
[69:43.52]Forever.
[69:56.53]My heart should not be beating this fast.
[69:58.57]What's wrong with me?
[70:01.41]Why?
[70:01.61]Alright, I'm doing it.
[70:03.83]I'm going for it.
[70:04.40]I got it.
[70:09.25]I'm so paranoid.
[70:10.99]Cause if I fall now... See?
[70:13.73]Look at- I fucked it up there.
[70:15.73]It's alright everybody, calm down.
[70:21.14]What a fucking idiot.
[70:23.86]What a dumbass.
[70:28.00]Oh, mini-golf!
[70:28.83]We're gonna build stairs now, just going to nowhere!
[70:46.92]They're getting denser, I have to- oh fuck.
[70:51.03]It's like climbing Everest.
[71:01.45]I feel like I'm really standing on these.
[71:04.09]I don't like this at all.
[71:05.03]I'm never doing this ever again.
[71:06.71]I'm never doing this in this game ever again.
[71:08.67]Why would I ever do it in the first place?
[71:11.27]Now there is a lip.
[71:13.71]Can I cross?
[71:14.89]Yep.
[71:15.91]Thank God.
[71:17.69]Oh, alright.
[71:18.13]That one's done.
[71:19.29]Now we have to go all the way up.
[71:21.88]Part two.
[71:37.45]now we have to go from here all the way up and then all the way down as long as I do it right and I can sell them each one as I go down
[72:05.37]Alright, here we are.
[72:06.75]Right here.
[72:08.62]Bang.
[72:09.90]Straight up.
[72:14.36]Don't fall off.
[72:27.83]If I... Don't make me laugh.
[72:30.09]If I fall off right now, you understand that the whole thing...
[72:35.77]was to get this one tower.
[72:37.63]And if I fall off, I have to do it again because I made two now.
[72:48.60]Fucking Jesus.
[72:50.56]And then I have to make three.
[72:51.70]And then I have to make four.
[72:54.80]Don't!
[72:56.78]Where am I?
[72:57.28]I... Oh, no.
[72:59.50]Where am I?
[72:59.94]What am I standing on?
[73:01.74]Okay, I made it.
[73:02.24]I made it.
[73:02.52]I can't jump.
[73:02.90]Okay, here we go.
[73:06.60]Okay, I'm good.
[73:22.59]I did it.
[73:23.45]I actually did it.
[73:31.07]Oh thank god.
[73:45.20]Ah, thank goodness.
[73:50.51]That whole crisis can now be put behind us.
[73:53.03]Seriously.
[73:54.49]Oh fuck, easy.
[73:55.29]Uh oh.
[75:03.23]I missed one?
[75:03.75]What are you talking about?
[75:05.63]I did not miss one.
[75:09.39]Wait, did I?
[75:10.29]Lie.
[75:10.91]Lies.
[75:13.29]I will not have that.
[75:19.74]It's clean.
[75:21.74]There's not one up there.
[75:23.56]Oh, man, that would have sucked.
[75:25.88]Okay, what?
[75:27.04]What were we doing?
[75:29.10]Oh, right, I was doing my vision.
[75:34.14]There's one near the tree.
[75:35.79]No, there is not one near the tree.
[75:39.53]They're all gone.
[75:46.88]Build a roller coaster.
[75:49.68]What do you mean, the tree?
[75:55.10]Nobody sees it.
[75:56.08]It's a lie.
[75:56.82]Alright, here we go.
[75:58.31]I want to make a garden here.
[76:04.57]Alright, I'm gonna say let's start from here.
[76:08.23]I want like a nice little patch right here coming out to here like a little bit here, but the trees are in the way.
[76:14.74]Why can't I just get rid of the trees?
[76:16.76]I don't want those trees.
[76:28.79]Make a roller coaster.
[76:32.31]No.
[76:34.66]Alright, I'll have to incorporate the trees.
[76:36.14]So... I want... I want like... God, I want... I'll take... Anybody want some wine?
[76:43.82]I think I'm gonna get a glass of wine.
[76:52.32]Just like one.
[76:53.20]I want to sip on it.
[76:59.53]I haven't had like a good wine in a while.
[77:05.00]Yeah, go get some wine.
[77:07.68]I'm going to need your help here.
[77:09.94]I'm going to need your help in creating this garden.
[77:13.92]In the comment section, what do you think I should put in the next episode?
[77:19.11]A tree?
[77:20.79]A moat?
[77:22.55]You decide.
[77:23.99]Alright, I'm going to go.
[77:24.83]Let's have a glass of wine.
[77:25.59]I'll be right back.
[77:30.37]I'll be less than 30 minutes, I promise.
[82:15.70]Time.
[82:15.92]Alright, I'm good.
[82:23.74]Let's go.
[82:27.57]Two minutes?
[82:28.21]Five minutes?
[82:29.55]Three minutes?
[82:31.41]How many minutes?
[82:36.25]Eighty-nine seconds?
[82:39.83]I feel like it was longer than that.
[82:45.54]We want you to build a ferris wheel.
[82:48.67]In time.
[82:49.57]In time.
[82:51.11]I got 399,000.
[82:51.55]So, let's see.
[82:57.85]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[83:00.97]I'm overwhelming myself.
[83:02.11]Slow.
[83:02.63]I'm not going to even look at chat for like another 25 streams.
[83:07.33]Okay.
[83:09.96]What did I want to do?
[83:10.70]103, 104.
[83:13.74]Stop counting.
[83:14.42]I'm breaking my own rule.
[83:24.41]Okay.
[83:24.53]I'm going to test.
[83:28.31]Architecture.
[83:29.97]Ooh.
[83:33.19]Oh.
[83:36.57]Round gazebo with a dome.
[83:38.99]Let me see.
[83:39.41]I like that one.
[83:45.24]Hold on.
[83:47.80]I'm going to have such a rich house.
[83:50.48]Cobblestone circle stair.
[83:54.28]A little stairway up to the gazebo.
[84:01.90]Three level garden stair.
[84:03.40]I could have just done these.
[84:04.34]Hmm.
[84:10.15]I don't know which one.
[84:18.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[84:25.41]How about this one?
[84:26.79]Let's just see what it looks like.
[84:28.13]I can sell it.
[84:47.27]That's too big.
[84:50.37]I think it's too big to put anywhere.
[84:55.99]Maybe here?
[84:56.47]I need the mini one.
[85:09.00]But I can't put a garden in here.
[85:10.86]This is bigger than the other one.
[85:13.67]No, that didn't say mini gazebo.
[85:15.55]It was mini-o gazebo, not mini.
[85:27.42]These are all fucking huge.
[85:33.44]I don't think... Maybe I don't even need one of these.
[85:40.41]What if it was like a little entryway off of the... Okay, so hold on.
[85:43.27]Here we are.
[85:46.11]Here's the front door.
[85:47.09]We're gonna get some nice stones here with a little... Another walkway that leads over here into the gardens.
[85:57.41]So you go through here.
[85:59.25]You go through the metal detector to make sure.
[86:02.19]And then you come into the garden.
[86:08.04]It's crooked.
[86:09.92]I'm just placing it there.
[86:15.32]Maybe I didn't pick the right color.
[86:23.81]Walnut.
[86:24.67]Walnut.
[86:29.06]Yeah, get out of here.
[86:38.95]Just, I'm going to put it there for now.
[86:41.11]I need a front entryway here.
[86:43.49]Entryway over this way.
[86:45.43]Leading into the garden.
[86:46.41]There can be a nice garden here.
[86:48.67]Right here for you to look at.
[86:50.73]And it starts right here, like this.
[86:54.60]I want the purple scheme that I had.
[86:56.75]Why are you fail fishing me?
[86:58.63]I put a... I put a... The wooden stand.
[87:05.61]What's wrong with that?
[87:07.97]I placed it on the ground.
[87:09.23]It's not going to be there permanently.
[87:10.41]No, you're getting in the way of my vision.
[87:17.21]Alright, so we're going to have... I want the purple, the red, I want the purple.
[87:21.16]Red and the kind of pink scale going up.
[87:24.78]Watch what I'm doing here.
[87:26.18]Pay attention.
[87:27.18]Close fucking attention.
[87:33.75]Ooh.
[87:58.26]Nice.
[88:01.06]Fence.
[88:01.36]Let's keep it that same color.
[88:19.95]Looks awful.
[88:20.87]What if it looks awful?
[88:26.54]It doesn't look awful!
[88:28.46]I haven't even done anything!
[88:40.65]Nah, it's gotta be- it's gotta be to here.
[89:05.71]What are you guys on about?
[89:11.75]What are you guys on right now?
[89:13.29]Why does this look wrong?
[89:42.42]That's better.
[89:51.22]Guys, the cars have to be able to go... Wait.
[89:56.35]Oh, fuck me.
[89:57.67]Okay, no.
[89:59.67]No, this is still fine.
[90:00.39]This is fine.
[90:01.47]This is the gate to the backyard.
[90:03.17]Everyone has a gate to their backyard.
[90:08.68]Gate to the backyard and there's a nice walkway garden.
[90:12.53]Everyone that's talking all this shit and typing all this shit in just under 12 to 15 hours.
[90:22.33]But would take a normal person probably six.
[90:26.53]You're gonna eat those words.
[90:31.76]Why do you have an entrance in the middle of your front yard?
[90:37.02]Because...
[90:38.42]This is not the front yard.
[90:39.61]This is now the back yard.
[90:41.59]This is the back yard.
[90:45.13]Here's the front yard.
[90:47.45]And then... Boom!
[90:49.95]Back yard.
[90:54.50]Well, technically, actually, it should be lined up here.
[90:56.54]Guys, I used to do this shit for money, okay?
[91:07.25]I used to move fences for money.
[91:09.10]I think I know what's going on.
[91:27.41]Fuck.
[91:27.81]I knew it was wrong.
[91:43.77]Is there like a snapping feature?
[91:47.41]Because I can't get a good look because I have to... Good.
[92:07.53]I'm going to sneeze.
[92:08.67]There's nothing I can do.
[92:47.38]I'm gonna sneeze again.
[92:48.34]I can't press any buttons.
[92:50.72]If you don't like people sneezing, just close it!
[93:01.97]Come on, flush!
[93:05.01]Flush, dammit!
[93:08.49]Don't make me get the plunger!
[93:22.65]Toilet humor.
[93:23.39]That wasn't... What?
[93:25.49]How is that like a... A toilet, like, poo-poo joke?
[93:29.51]I could have been flushing... Anything.
[93:44.12]God damn it.
[93:47.78]Can I add, like, a section?
[93:51.29]Half-fence?
[93:55.91]No, fuck.
[94:00.69]No, why?
[94:01.97]Why can I not extend this?
[94:03.03]I'm gonna have to have a tree right here.
[94:10.45]This is a doggy entrance.
[94:12.01]No, this is the entrance to the back garden.
[94:17.19]Just use hedges.
[94:18.67]There are hedges already here.
[94:19.93]That's gonna look fucking strange.
[94:22.05]There's already like a line of bushes.
[94:23.99]Oh, just put another one right here.
[94:25.91]No criminal will just, like, wedge his way into it.
[94:34.73]Is it straight?
[94:36.07]Let's give it a good look.
[94:39.99]It's pretty straight.
[94:43.57]I cannot delete these bushes, no.
[94:46.17]We'll put something there.
[94:46.83]We'll figure it out.
[94:47.37]Alright, anyways.
[94:51.73]So here, bang.
[94:53.93]Nice little garden to start.
[94:56.05]In fact, I'm going to do bingo.
[94:58.63]Bingo.
[95:00.37]This is going to drive me fucking crazy.
[95:09.42]It's going to drive me crazy.
[95:14.08]Oh, god damn it.
[95:40.78]Just roll it out there.
[95:41.64]I'm just gonna have it go all the way.
[95:49.92]Jermas, please stop.
[95:51.33]Please stop what?
[95:56.81]What?
[95:57.11]Why?
[96:02.68]Just stop it.
[96:05.24]What do you want me to stop exactly?
[96:17.28]The grass is crooked.
[96:19.53]Once it's all laid out there, you're not going to know.
[96:20.93]That won't be a difference.
[96:33.63]Alright.
[96:35.63]I'm getting there.
[96:37.90]It's going to look really nice, I promise.
[96:39.38]If there's one thing I can promise you, is it will look good.
[96:47.71]Pick up the trash first.
[96:48.79]I'm just going one at a time, because if I... Just stop.
[96:57.44]Don't make promises you can't keep.
[96:59.14]I see what you mean, like over here.
[97:05.35]Because I need to get it finished as I go.
[97:22.35]Yeah, I was supposed to be in the other corner.
[97:31.12]What situation should Germapop be used in?
[97:33.50]That's at your discretion, whatever you feel.
[97:52.52]Good, good, good.
[97:53.78]Come here.
[97:54.14]Alright, that should be enough.
[98:07.13]Let's get the edge here.
[98:08.39]I don't see any more of the mini-map in this corner, at least.
[98:15.73]So I think we're good.
[98:17.14]Except it's behind the hedges, though.
[98:18.74]How the hell would you even see that?
[98:21.48]There's no way you would see that shit.
[98:29.82]I can't get it all in one pass.
[98:32.02]Unfortunately.
[98:44.81]Come on!
[98:45.33]Look at the mini-map!
[98:46.07]It's right here!
[98:48.65]Ah!
[98:49.33]Did I get it?
[98:49.77]Yeah, I did.
[98:56.84]Come on, get it.
[98:58.66]Get it all.
[99:04.67]Oh, yes.
[99:06.11]Okay.
[99:07.95]There's one last little speck right here.
[99:11.11]I should have got it in one way right here.
[99:16.35]Alright, we're officially completely clean on this right side.
[99:26.20]Now the only question is just getting the grass laid out here so I can start building.
[99:31.10]Look at how much more of this is gonna be so ridiculous.
[99:39.22]I'm never gonna stop streaming.
[99:43.64]Well, the internet has been pretty decent so far.
[99:46.22]So, I mean, if I got internet... I ain't fucking turning it off.
[99:53.56]Congratulations, you mowed the lawn.
[99:58.92]Be nicer.
[100:01.73]You're being very mean.
[100:04.69]I not only mowed the lawn, I picked up 3,000 pounds of trash and I'm rolling out new grass.
[100:15.40]That's a very mean thing to say.
[100:24.38]See, it just happens sometimes.
[100:25.54]It just does it.
[100:36.00]There's so much Z fighting on that fence.
[100:38.46]What do you mean Z fighting?
[100:53.09]Z fighting?
[100:59.13]What is this Z fighting?
[101:05.61]Like anti-aliasing?
[101:06.71]Are we getting a bunch of aliasing?
[101:09.88]What do you mean Z-fighting?
[101:16.48]I don't think I can get it all in one roll, but it's worth a try.
[101:20.27]He does... I don't... I have no idea.
[101:21.87]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[101:24.53]I don't know what Z-fighting is.
[101:36.98]Oh, the grass in the back?
[101:39.79]Why would I know what Z fighting means?
[101:41.97]It's like being in the doctor's office.
[101:55.60]Doctor comes in.
[101:57.69]Do you know what this tool is?
[101:59.83]Uh, I don't know.
[102:00.37]Is it a stethoscope?
[102:02.53]No, stupid.
[102:03.65]Why do you not know that?
[102:05.00]It's a hydroscope.
[102:06.24]What are you, stupid?
[102:08.24]You're pretty dumb.
[102:14.06]Oh, okay.
[102:16.58]I'm an idiot.
[102:18.08]Right, chat?
[102:20.30]Let's get a fucking GoPro on.
[102:37.80]He's like looking away while he's doing like an exam.
[102:45.30]Everything seems fine.
[102:47.97]Doctor, my stomach is hurting.
[102:50.57]You're touching my neck.
[102:52.73]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[102:53.27]I was looking at chat.
[102:54.59]What did you come in for?
[103:07.25]That shit's gonna be real.
[103:11.71]You think that's me fucking around?
[103:14.15]Give it like another 50 years.
[103:15.35]Alright, that's better.
[103:31.08]What would his alert sounds be?
[103:34.70]A flatline?
[103:38.16]Hey, thank you flatliners!
[103:39.80]Welcome to the flatliners!
[103:47.39]Am I okay?
[103:50.35]Yeah, he comes in, you're like hooked up.
[103:53.77]You're like just had surgery.
[103:57.35]You're sitting there.
[103:59.47]All of a sudden the flat line comes on.
[104:04.03]There's something wrong, what's happening?
[104:06.00]Thank you!
[104:08.13]B.D.
[104:09.01]Duck.
[104:10.96]21, 6, 6, 6.
[104:11.04]25 months.
[104:16.92]I'll go to the flatlining patients.
[104:20.02]Yeah, you just flatlined, didn't you?
[104:22.92]Oh, here, take these.
[104:25.30]This will help for the pain and...
[104:38.11]Oh, thank you.
[104:38.81]Hey, whoa.
[104:40.35]A 20, a 32-month sub just came in.
[104:45.07]From, oh, hey, Doc should poison the patient.
[104:48.29]That's a funny username.
[104:52.25]But no, seriously, take those once every four hours.
[105:06.84]This is not going to work.
[105:11.12]What even is this room?
[105:12.35]What is this?
[105:14.89]Room 86M2.
[105:15.11]Alright, well, hold on.
[105:19.17]This is the front door, and then this is... So this is a back slider, and then... Is this, like, another two-car garage?
[105:26.72]No, the staircase is here.
[105:27.68]There's another back door?
[105:31.94]Oh, the house is a sub!
[105:33.68]Ha ha ha ha!
[105:36.15]hey thank you thank you room 86 m squared for the 12 months appreciate it no that's not the garage the garage is over here it's a normal living room um is it though because
[105:58.90]You have two, three back entry ways to the... It's kind of odd.
[106:03.34]I don't think that... One of these, this would be normal, but this seems like kind of redundant.
[106:10.42]Somebody just gave $115.
[106:10.98]That's $115.
[106:11.90]That's Hayden Clip Fell.
[106:12.76]For the $115 bucks.
[106:30.47]That's a lot of money.
[106:31.51]There's no message here.
[106:37.22]You've just flatlined.
[106:42.40]Welcome.
[106:43.10]You've just flatlined.
[106:45.48]I've just flatlined?
[106:47.77]No, no, idiot.
[106:48.71]I'm looking at chat.
[106:49.43]You're dumb.
[107:05.07]His scenario.
[107:06.47]Doctors doing surgery.
[107:10.29]But first of all, before we get into this, that's a fucking lot of money.
[107:13.19]There's no message here.
[107:14.11]You just gave me a ton of money.
[107:15.23]Thank you, Hayden.
[107:16.09]That's a lot of fucking money.
[107:18.01]Thank you.
[107:22.71]All I can say is thanks.
[107:23.63]That's more than I could ever ask anyone to ever give me in dollars.
[107:27.44]Ever.
[107:33.88]What's going on here?
[107:37.55]Why?
[107:39.74]Strange.
[107:41.70]But, yeah, imagine the doctor's doing surgery.
[107:48.52]He's got the chat open.
[107:49.78]And he's doing, like, a gallstone removal on somebody.
[107:55.56]All of a sudden, he, like, misses one.
[107:58.54]Blind.
[107:59.38]Oh, blind.
[108:00.24]Dude, can you not see that?
[108:02.33]How can he be this stupid?
[108:03.41]He can't see that other gallstone?
[108:05.47]What are you guys talking about?
[108:06.47]I got them all.
[108:09.82]Wow, holy shit, he's so bad.
[108:11.92]He like moves the organ.
[108:20.06]Over here?
[108:21.47]Over this way?
[108:27.37]Is he pretending?
[108:29.97]Is he pretending to be this bad?
[108:44.21]He's faking it.
[108:49.18]You know how people, like, overreact?
[108:52.49]And stuff like, WHOA, A JUMP SCARE!
[108:54.73]Imagine the overreacting Twitch doctor.

[109:54.54]PogChamp.
[110:07.02]No, no, no.
[110:07.32]It'd be something else.
[110:08.04]It'd be like... It'd be like... DocChamp.
[110:11.64]And it'd be like him with a stethoscope on.
[110:13.08]Like, with his mouth open.
[110:14.08]Like, what?
[110:23.13]I need a small one for this.
[110:27.49]They look like cigars.
[110:32.03]Or, no, they look like those Little Debbie rolls.
[110:35.59]You know those chocolate rolls?
[110:36.89]What are they called?
[110:40.36]Those swirls, like the Little Debbie rolls?
[110:43.56]Swiss rolls, there it is, yeah.
[110:45.64]No, not turd rolls, Swiss rolls.
[110:52.49]Fuck you.
[110:58.53]The doctor's been screaming for like fucking eight hours straight.
[111:01.15]It's in the middle of like fucking surgery.
[111:05.67]That's gonna be it, I think.
[111:07.49]I'm just fucking beat, you know.
[111:09.37]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[111:10.19]We'll pick it up before we left off.
[111:13.17]Just keep this guy in sedation.
[111:18.57]I'll just save the game.
[111:19.81]Yeah, I'll save it here.
[111:27.58]to take some wine breaks.
[111:32.94]I don't think I can get over here.
[111:34.34]Same problem from last time.
[111:35.98]There's going to be this one tiny little stupid patch that I can't get.
[111:38.73]Oh, that's annoying.
[111:43.59]Oh, that's annoying.
[111:44.33]I hate that.
[111:45.55]Come on.
[111:50.91]Nope.
[111:53.47]Just gravel.
[111:54.21]Yeah, I'll have to... I hate it.
[112:04.75]Yeah, this collision here for some reason.
[112:16.76]Delete the trees?
[112:17.56]I can't.
[112:20.92]I fucking thought I had it.
[112:25.88]Oh well.
[112:27.08]Can't get them all.
[112:30.99]But I can do this.
[112:33.33]Sell trees.
[112:34.24]You can't sell trees.
[112:35.10]Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[112:38.72]See?
[112:53.25]See?
[112:53.53]That looks good.
[112:57.07]I mean, I know I said I wasn't going to do this, but I might as well.
[113:05.80]Jeremiah, please, I'm a fan.
[113:08.16]Concerned about your... I've been adamant... In the past, you've been adamant that you've been fine, but now it seems like you need at least one glass each stream to get by.
[113:14.55]Is it us?
[113:14.93]Do we make the stream harder to get through?
[113:16.39]Jesus Christ.
[113:30.26]Is it us?
[113:39.92]The last time I had a glass of wine on stream, or alcohol on stream, was Nintendo Labo.
[113:47.75]That was like three and a half weeks ago.
[113:49.89]Almost a month ago.
[113:51.31]More than that.
[113:53.49]So, I don't know what stream you're talking about, because that's not this one.
[113:59.68]Hammer the tree?
[114:00.36]It don't work.
[114:00.78]Watch, I'll prove it.
[114:04.52]See?
[114:05.88]Told you.
[114:09.61]Told you.
[114:12.19]Oh, jebaited.
[114:14.53]Chat, you know, you don't understand.
[114:16.43]It doesn't work.
[114:18.19]I'm not gonna use the saw on his bone, on his leg.
[114:22.20]That's not gonna work.
[114:22.96]It's not gonna fix his, uh, it's not gonna fix his gallbladder.
[114:27.20]Do it, do it, do it.
[114:28.24]Oh my god, alright, fine.
[114:33.94]See?
[114:34.20]Oh, did I just get jebaited?
[114:44.61]Loud.
[114:48.38]Use drill on toe.
[114:52.98]He's still on the doctor bit.
[114:55.66]Yeah, I am.
[114:56.78]I'm kind of stuck on it.
[114:59.47]Things just keep popping into my brain.
[115:01.85]So I have to just say them out loud.
[115:11.06]Come on.
[115:11.40]Get in there.
[115:12.00]Right there.
[115:12.74]Right.
[115:13.38]Wait.
[115:13.90]Right there.
[115:14.42]Right here.
[115:17.94]Oh, come on.
[115:18.92]What do you mean clear the path?
[115:22.62]There's nothing in the path.
[115:27.64]The path is already written.
[115:30.34]Come on!
[115:32.64]I'm the best.
[115:33.50]I'm the best.
[115:34.34]I'm the best at what I do.
[115:36.00]I'm the best.
[115:36.86]I'm the best.
[115:37.72]I'm the best at what I do.
[115:50.14]What is it that you do?
[115:53.22]Whatever it is I do.
[116:02.22]Come on.
[116:03.27]Look at how far away this is.
[116:07.61]Patch notes.
[116:09.03]Garden flipper.
[116:09.71]1.104.
[116:09.73]Remove collision around trees.
[116:11.79]Come on.
[116:20.94]Come on!
[116:21.48]I'm just gonna have to go like this.
[116:36.91]I shouldn't have to do it like this.
[117:09.51]Yeah, I'm done.
[117:12.91]I'm done.
[117:15.81]Yeah, I'm... No, I'm done.
[117:17.45]That's it.
[117:27.07]I somehow made it worse.
[117:28.03]I know, and that's why I gave up.
[117:34.54]I'm gonna do one right here.
[117:37.00]Oh, no, no, no.
[117:39.92]No, no, no.
[117:40.88]Stutter step, stutter step, stutter step.
[117:44.82]Maybe I should just clean it all up.
[117:46.10]But then I'm gonna be overwhelmed.
[117:48.34]I'm gonna look around and go, fuck, this is too big.
[117:51.40]I'm just gonna make a pizza oven.
[117:53.48]That's the house.
[117:58.12]Alright, now it's clean enough for me to do what I want to do over here.
[118:04.55]Now I've got to get my vision to unfold.
[118:08.01]Um... At what I do.
[118:14.77]I'm the best.
[118:15.63]I'm the best.
[118:16.07]I'm the fucking best at what I do.
[118:17.85]Come on!
[118:18.43]Think about something.
[118:19.15]Okay, I got it.
[118:24.72]Get this out of the way.
[118:32.24]We're going to go one step at a time.
[118:34.76]I need a entryway.
[118:36.18]First of all, we need a door here.
[118:37.55]First of all... Give me a door so I can look at this the way that I should look at it.
[118:45.45]No, not yet, because I need to... We're gonna go stone.
[118:49.17]Stone.
[118:50.15]Stone.
[118:51.33]Stone.
[118:52.51]Stone.
[118:54.63]Um... No, I want, like, a surface.
[119:01.47]No, not the terrible tablet that fucking crashes every five minutes.
[119:04.91]I want one of these.
[119:06.17]Hmm.
[119:16.94]What do I want for a walk?
[119:18.64]Maybe take the gravel?
[119:25.03]This is nice.
[119:25.53]Let's see what this looks like.
[119:29.67]I'm thinking... the beige.
[119:31.61]I think there's a bigger version of this.
[119:42.66]No, that looks like dog shit.
[119:43.98]I don't want that.
[119:53.91]I like this.
[119:54.37]How does it feel to be employed by thousands of people?
[120:00.98]I mean, I'm a man of the people.
[120:08.58]Hmm.
[120:11.99]Orange?
[120:12.57]Orange isn't bad.
[120:19.48]But dark gray's not bad either.
[120:21.10]Let's see.
[120:21.38]Let me see what this looks like.
[120:22.44]I need to get paving stones.
[120:25.53]Paving stones block without a curve.
[120:27.59]Paving stones.
[120:28.25]I just gotta get paving stones.
[120:30.35]Paving stones.
[120:33.41]Here we go.
[120:34.81]Alright, that looks alright.
[120:40.61]Ooh.
[120:42.08]We can do a little trim, too.
[120:43.14]Ooh!
[120:46.86]Ooh!
[120:49.04]That is a really, really nice blue and white paving stone.
[120:55.71]Hmm.
[121:03.53]That's a beautiful blue and white.
[121:04.89]What are you talking about?
[121:14.69]You see gold and... Where's the gold?
[121:17.12]I don't understand what you're talking about.
[121:20.97]Gold and... what?
[121:24.19]I don't see that shit.
[121:25.33]What, are you crazy?
[121:29.70]That's not the color of that dress.
[121:32.22]Your brain is wired strangely.
[121:42.20]You guys don't know what I'm talking about?
[121:44.22]That is like, this is the exact color scheme of that picture.
[121:50.65]What?
[121:50.87]That's like, this is the same exact color scheme.
[121:57.83]Golden, white, blue, yeah, come on.
[122:05.19]Did I see this joke on Facebook?
[122:07.91]I saw the picture on Facebook.
[122:12.73]I like this.
[122:20.27]Jeez, fucking rough crowd tonight.
[122:23.56]Rough crowd out there, be careful.
[122:26.68]They're all like drinking wine.
[122:32.68]Uh, should I go into the house with this?
[122:54.09]Let's get a little bit more here.
[123:01.57]How is this wrong?
[123:07.45]This is not even wrong.
[123:09.77]Wrong.
[123:10.99]This is actually very incorrect.
[123:16.50]If you are looking... No, this is not wrong, because look.
[123:20.68]Guys, guys, guys, guys.
[123:22.89]If it's lined up perfectly here, then it won't be lined up perfectly with the door.
[123:31.08]Uh-oh.
[123:33.74]Have we reached, like, the event horizon here?
[123:41.12]We're at the event horizon!
[123:55.42]How does this look?
[123:58.66]That's not bad.
[124:05.25]No, no, no, no, what happened there?
[124:06.31]Okay, then we're gonna go like this.
[124:25.90]Two-tone.
[124:28.10]We got like a... Let me see what this will look like.
[124:31.63]I can't just put it... Why can I not do that?
[124:42.41]I can.
[124:45.97]I can.
[124:58.39]Grandma's rug.
[124:59.45]It's not Grandma's rug.
[125:05.28]It doesn't look like... I know, we already made the fish tank reference.
[125:09.89]The bottom of the ocean reference.
[125:30.79]I need to do rounded, I think.
[125:32.09]To the other side.
[125:33.93]Uneven laughing my ass off.
[125:35.95]Oh, get out of here.
[125:37.65]Get out of here with that.
[125:39.07]What do you mean, uneven?
[125:40.33]I got... Yeah, it is uneven.
[125:43.63]It's rocks.
[125:44.79]They're rocks.
[125:46.28]You can't have a straight line with rocks.
[125:51.86]Uneven.
[125:52.84]Oh my god, it's uneven.
[125:58.28]Those crushed stones.
[126:05.99]Hey, better than your house.
[126:13.26]I love that argument.
[126:14.52]Better than what you have.
[126:15.20]Better than what you did.
[126:20.02]Dude, this stream, like, sucks.
[126:21.58]Oh, better than your stream.
[126:22.36]Have you streamed before?
[126:23.00]Better than your stream.
[126:25.55]Fuck you, buddy.
[126:32.19]Actually, I want to go a little more.
[126:42.32]Hey dude, on the webcam, you had like something in your teeth.
[126:45.26]Like a bunch of asparagus or shit.
[126:46.48]Yeah, better than your stream.
[126:47.50]Do you stream?
[126:47.92]You don't fucking know.
[126:49.94]No, I'm... Okay.
[126:51.26]I should probably do round.
[127:12.41]Hey dude, did you just like punch a guy in the face on stream that didn't do anything?
[127:17.34]Okay, yeah, whatever, you don't stream.
[127:19.38]Where's your stream if it's so easy?
[127:33.80]This is not good.
[127:34.72]What?
[127:35.26]I'm just starting.
[127:37.02]This is going to expand out a little.
[127:39.28]Give me a day.
[127:40.16]Do you even stream?
[127:41.12]Do you even know what it's like?
[127:47.41]The fucking Dreamcast sucks.
[127:50.09]Laughing my ass off.
[127:52.61]The Dreamcast.
[127:53.49]What was it?
[127:53.87]It was the Dreamcast fucking sucks.
[127:56.51]Laughing my ass off.
[128:00.61]I did fuck that one up.
[128:01.53]I'll give that one to you.
[128:03.87]I'll give that one to you.
[128:04.70]Yeah, I fucked it up.
[128:08.60]Okay, thanks, great.
[128:09.78]What?
[128:10.14]Why?
[128:12.86]Actually... Hold on a second here.
[128:23.65]I think I can... I'm gonna do some sculpting.
[128:29.03]This is gonna be actually kind of cool.
[128:45.99]It didn't go out of the way to the gate.
[128:48.11]Bad illusions of sculpting.
[128:51.27]No, I'm gonna start up big here and we're gonna put a couple of bushes in the shed.
[128:56.18]Just bear with me.
[129:00.86]I'm gonna do some sculpting.
[129:08.23]This is not ruined!
[129:22.91]You guys ever been to a house in Las Vegas?
[129:35.58]That shows.
[129:36.40]You guys... No, never mind.
[130:03.80]I'm gonna... Just watch.
[130:05.12]Just wait.
[130:05.48]Just give me a second.
[130:10.03]Guys, Rome wasn't built in a day!
[130:20.99]It looks like the house is puking.
[130:23.55]I want that guy... Out of here.
[130:26.40]For life.
[130:29.68]Comparing this house to Rome, yes I am.
[130:31.90]If there's a problem with that...
[130:33.91]You don't even know what it's like to stream.
[130:36.93]Okay, I'm done.
[130:37.79]I'll stop that one.
[130:39.27]Okay, hold on.
[130:47.59]Right here.
[130:53.41]I need enough to, like, carve.
[130:55.39]Let's go a little more.
[131:06.74]Okay, here we go.
[131:07.48]Here we go.
[131:07.77]Here we go.
[131:08.05]Here we go.
[131:08.33]Here we go.
[131:08.89]Here we go.
[131:35.36]I can't help that it makes like the jagged Minecraft pixels, okay?
[131:42.13]You guys want perfection?
[131:44.19]Fine.
[131:49.23]It's not possible.
[131:49.97]Perfection doesn't exist.
[131:51.79]Get that out of your head.
[132:07.32]Perfection doesn't exist, he says.
[132:08.74]Okay, now for here I wanted to go like this.
[132:16.77]Start right here.
[132:25.60]Make it look a little more natural.
[132:39.53]I wish I could have the, like, Photoshop.
[132:41.76]Why is this not Photoshop?
[132:56.44]I really need to... I need to get, like, here.
[133:02.31]Okay.
[133:02.71]Let me see what that line... Pull this in a little more.
[133:16.24]Okay, it's hard to do this when you can't start from the edge.
[133:22.64]You have to be on top of it.
[133:46.54]This ain't like a brush tool in Photoshop, guys.
[133:52.75]I... It's not gonna do what I want it to do.
[133:58.79]That's better.
[134:11.51]Yeah, yeah!
[134:15.10]Okay, same thing over here.
[134:17.17]So it starts... Curve begins here.
[134:25.09]Might need a little more, but it goes like this.
[134:32.32]It's gotta be up a little more.
[134:37.10]I'm gonna put some bushes here.
[134:39.54]You can't just skip all this shit!
[134:43.46]So this is way too much.
[134:58.26]I got a misleading line because the pixels are being deleted.
[135:01.34]Alright?
[135:02.16]Lookit.
[135:03.02]Don't tell me I did that wrong when I had a clear line here that's being shaved as I step back.
[135:14.90]Right here.
[135:18.28]No, right here.
[135:37.76]Almost there.
[135:39.02]I can fix this, don't worry, just watch.
[135:43.62]I'm gonna have to add some more in here.
[135:46.66]It's getting there.
[135:49.38]Look down and move backwards, because it doesn't matter.
[135:51.58]Because if I move backwards from here, like this, so already I'm lined up, and if I move backwards from here, it's not possible.
[136:03.99]Watch, I'll show you.
[136:06.24]Like, I'm going to start right here.
[136:08.20]Like, I can't, there's no way, unless I have like an angle meter on my right hand side of my screen.
[136:12.27]I have no idea where I'm standing.
[136:14.25]So right here.
[136:16.11]If I step back, like see, I've already moved to the left.
[136:27.82]And I have to hold the mouse button down.
[136:30.86]So, it's going to move.
[136:40.69]There's no clear way to make sure I'm on the plane.
[136:46.48]It's like console aiming.
[136:54.22]No, there's no way.
[136:57.60]Like, no.
[136:58.16]It's not going to happen.
[137:00.94]Use the minimap.
[137:04.68]How do I do plus and minus on the minimap?
[137:12.24]I just did?
[137:12.86]No, I didn't.
[137:16.14]I did not just do that.
[137:18.32]It doesn't need to be perfect.
[137:19.34]Rome wasn't fucking perfect.
[137:23.57]They took their fucking time and Rome was kind of sloppy.
[137:28.75]Sloppy Rome was built in a few days.
[137:32.69]I need to add some here.
[137:34.41]There.
[137:39.04]I want it to be circled, though.
[137:41.44]Or maybe not.
[137:45.59]Because it starts like here.
[137:47.97]Why are you stopping here?
[137:50.29]Why are you doing that?
[137:51.77]Why did you do that?
[137:52.95]Why didn't you just go forward?
[138:03.78]I hate that.
[138:08.86]Close enough.
[138:10.70]That's close enough.
[138:11.28]I'm going to add a little bit right here.
[138:21.81]Got it.
[138:22.21]I did it.
[138:23.07]I did it.
[138:23.61]That's good.
[138:34.86]Got it.
[138:38.80]Good.
[138:39.16]Okay.
[138:44.08]that's very close and it's like this hard line right here does not match up exactly with here I mean it kind of does it's the same as when you started no it's not it's a little different what are you drinking alright so now we're gonna dual color here
[139:13.93]No, we're not.
[139:16.05]We're not gonna do that.
[139:18.33]We're gonna do bushes.
[139:23.37]I gotta go back to the garden settings.
[139:27.72]Let me do the bushes first.
[139:33.00]Stump.
[139:34.44]Looks like shit.
[139:36.36]Incredibly ugly.
[139:37.96]Like, I would never have that in my house.
[139:41.70]Throw it in the trash.
[139:47.10]Is that all of them?
[139:49.26]No, ooh!
[140:24.64]That's a normie bush.
[140:32.02]How is that a normie bush?
[140:33.74]This is the shit that's in fucking Las Vegas.
[140:39.99]Normie bush?
[140:40.99]Is it a- No, this is a normie bush!
[140:44.77]Like, one of these!
[140:50.35]The bush j- A normie bush is a cloud that is colored green.
[140:56.28]That's a normie bush.
[141:04.26]Ooh, I like these.
[141:11.95]I'm gonna move these around.
[141:17.39]Couple of hostas.
[141:18.05]I feel like I want these to be a little bigger.
[141:30.70]I want something bigger here.
[141:47.88]Let me see.
[141:48.78]I need like a little bit bigger.
[141:50.83]But I still want it to be like desert Vegas style.
[141:52.91]Let's go down here.
[141:58.27]Mmm, 0.5.
[141:59.29]I need, like, a couple meters, I think.
[142:05.43]A palm tree.
[142:07.23]No, that would be weird in your house.
[142:11.36]I could get a big one.
[142:13.52]Wait, hold on.
[142:15.84]Ooh.
[142:18.26]Not bad.
[142:18.78]Let's see.
[142:19.08]No, that's not a big one.
[142:31.01]How big are these?
[142:34.07]No, this just looks like... This looks like... Dude, this is just like Canadian leaves.
[142:38.53]This is not Canada.
[142:47.67]Hmm, no.
[142:51.55]Maybe one of these?
[142:52.94]Creeping Dents.
[143:02.80]These are trees.
[143:04.56]Dwarf shrub.
[143:06.08]No.
[143:07.96]These aren't bad.
[143:10.12]How big are these?
[143:14.06]I like that kind of greenish.
[143:17.56]Could go like here.
[143:20.33]And then here.
[143:26.93]And then have like a big one right here and a big one right here.
[143:30.85]These are the worst plants.
[143:42.19]Alright.
[143:46.31]I need something bigger.
[143:48.47]Large.
[143:49.63]Maybe a ball bush?
[143:51.91]No.
[143:52.49]Ooh!
[143:52.83]Yeah!
[143:53.65]Yep.
[143:54.11]Mm-hmm.
[143:54.51]Mm-hmm.
[143:54.69]Mm-hmm.
[143:55.13]Yes.
[143:55.69]Yes.
[143:56.55]Yes!
[143:57.57]Yes!
[143:57.85]These are everywhere out here.
[144:01.46]What color should it be?
[144:02.18]None of these.
[144:02.84]This is good.
[144:03.22]Like, kind of that little off-green, kind of, like, baby shit color.
[144:11.66]One here and maybe like one here.
[144:14.78]Let me just see.
[144:26.50]No.
[144:27.28]Gotta be a different color.
[144:34.27]I think I want a different color.
[144:35.21]I think I want a green.
[144:44.90]I'll get a couple of flowers in here, too.
[144:47.82]Yeah.
[144:48.91]That's a good idea.
[144:49.59]I think I want to just straight up green, though.
[144:51.63]Let me see what that looks like.
[144:53.65]If it looks any better.
[144:54.55]Just move these out of the way.
[144:59.91]Oh, man.
[145:00.34]Oh, man.
[145:01.24]Man, wait a minute here.
[145:02.14]Man.
[145:02.46]Wait.
[145:04.92]Wait.
[145:19.01]I'm not happy with the placement.
[145:28.64]Move this over.
[145:51.56]Symmetrical house?
[145:54.43]What?
[145:55.27]I like symmetry with plants.
[146:00.31]This is a tutorial on rails arcade shooter house.
[146:03.61]What?
[146:05.94]What an insanely specific thing to say.
[146:17.12]Yeah, we'll make a little pond here.
[146:20.20]Everyone likes to just talk shit.
[146:24.62]That looks stupid.
[146:25.56]That looks terrible.
[146:26.88]I think that's not even good.
[146:29.31]You should have this kind of plant, and then you should bury that one in the sand.
[146:38.19]What an ugly display.
[146:41.31]You should see my display.
[146:47.35]It's marvelous.
[146:48.59]Oh, we unlocked a new voice.
[146:57.38]Oh, nice.
[147:10.67]Power Ranger bad guy voice.
[147:22.15]That's fucking hilarious.
[147:24.85]It's true.
[147:27.47]That is 100% correct.
[147:41.00]After 10,000 years, I'm free!
[147:43.96]It's time to conquer Earth!
[147:48.64]Oh, I can plant it.

[148:28.74]Power Rangers, it's me, Zordon.
[148:31.88]There it is.
[148:32.58]That's all I can do.
[148:34.24]We can do, like, pots.
[148:35.02]That's cool.
[148:40.31]Matilda has landed on Earth.
[148:43.19]She's trying to take it over.
[148:45.43]Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
[148:46.75]I can't believe that!
[148:48.65]What was his name?
[148:49.17]Ooh.
[149:08.34]I need a different color here though.
[149:11.86]No, this doesn't work.
[149:15.95]What idiot hired this landscaper?
[149:17.73]This idiot did.
[149:18.95]I hired this idiot landscaper because I'm the idiot that owns the idiot house.
[149:32.95]I can't place it.
[149:48.93]Is it too small?
[149:49.65]It's got to be smaller.
[149:55.21]I want it right here.
[149:56.37]Is there a little one?
[150:06.58]Round shaped pond.
[150:10.10]Fountains?
[150:10.60]Should I just have like fucking fountains?
[150:16.76]Like up here?
[150:18.48]Two fountains.
[150:20.26]Right when you walk in the front door.
[150:32.20]Yeah, I like it.
[150:33.86]I want a pond here.
[150:39.15]Actually, no.
[150:39.57]Why would you have a pond at the front door?
[150:41.57]Should I just have a bunch of these?
[150:46.79]Like, these things are cool.
[150:49.18]No, no, no.
[150:50.06]I'm blowing my whole budget at the front door.
[150:54.82]I think that looks nice.
[150:57.50]We need a pond.
[150:58.10]A little one.
[151:04.84]I want some flowers, though.
[151:05.84]I need... Um...
[151:13.17]Stop the symmetry.
[151:18.21]What's wrong with symmetry?
[151:23.27]Are they cactus?
[151:24.83]I don't think they're a cactus.
[151:29.98]No.
[151:30.74]Unfortunately, no cactus.
[151:33.22]It's very old-fashioned.
[151:35.64]What's wrong with that?
[151:39.22]I think I want...
[151:41.55]I mean, this looks like shit.
[151:42.91]You'd think it looks like shit because of this.
[151:46.43]The house needs work.
[151:48.87]You know, we're going inside out.
[151:50.41]There's a bug on me!
[151:51.19]No, there's not.
[151:51.89]Jesus Christ, I'm out of my mind.
[151:53.51]I'm something wrong with my brain.
[151:57.66]I'm losing my mind.
[151:59.62]I've lost my brain.
[152:01.20]It's gone.
[152:01.92]I don't have it anymore.
[152:03.76]My headphones touched me in the neck and I thought there was a scorpion on me.
[152:10.19]I don't do any drugs.
[152:12.13]I'm like sober.
[152:14.59]I don't understand.
[152:15.99]Alright, I need to get rid of those.
[152:24.53]Because this is bringing the whole thing down.
[152:28.23]I don't like the color on the outside either.
[152:29.74]I'm doing a Vegas house.
[152:32.96]Vegas style.
[152:35.64]Can I not open the window from out here?
[152:44.60]I have to climb to the roof?
[152:46.48]How am I supposed to remove these?
[152:53.81]How do I get there?
[152:54.65]I think this is impossible.
[153:08.58]Can I just reach them?
[153:11.31]Yeah, I can just reach.
[153:12.05]Okay.
[153:12.47]So now there's no boarded up windows.
[153:14.04]I mean, it's ugly in here.
[153:18.24]And I gotta get the outside.
[153:19.86]I'm either painting or I need, um... I need, like, that, like, Adobe look.
[153:29.66]Let's see here.
[153:32.34]No, um... Walls, right?
[153:41.05]It's too dark.
[153:44.95]Plaster bucket.
[153:50.67]No.
[153:53.18]Wood, brick.
[153:54.70]I mean, that's not like wood, though.
[153:56.40]You know what I mean?
[154:07.30]No, that's not going to look right.
[154:14.33]Can I, like, no.
[154:19.19]No, I'm not sure I can do it.
[154:22.77]This is the closest thing, but this is going to look really strange.
[154:25.55]Let me just see.
[154:43.02]Is he going to do what I asked for the past 50 minutes?
[154:45.48]What am I doing?
[154:49.32]He's doing it.
[154:51.30]What are we talking about?
[154:59.71]He's doing it.
[155:04.89]No, that's not going to look right.
[155:15.49]No, not 3D.
[155:18.51]It's gotta be that, like, beige, kind of orange, reds, like this, but that's not correct.
[155:26.93]This is a floor tile.
[155:37.26]What if I, maybe paint.
[155:38.70]Let me check the paint.
[155:40.56]I'll try to paint it or something.
[155:47.73]It's like this.
[155:51.88]Let me just see what happens when I do this.
[155:57.88]Although there are a lot of houses in like apartments and complexes that are this color.
[156:02.43]Let's see what this looks like.
[156:03.87]Wait a minute.
[156:29.31]That's... No.
[156:37.64]No, that's good.
[156:38.74]It's got to be... No, it's not a flesh house.
[156:55.67]The walls just look like they're stained.
[156:57.35]Well, I can't do the thing I want to do.
[157:00.71]How do you even have something on the outside?
[157:03.54]Why- Ceramic tiles, classic, green.
[157:07.42]Why can't I just pick the color?
[157:10.60]Why- Just- Oh my god, it's green.
[157:12.68]Sorry.
[157:13.88]Only green.
[157:18.53]Wall panels.
[157:20.13]All we got is grandma paper and wood.
[157:26.47]I need, like, outside walls.
[157:37.70]Plaster?
[157:38.22]No, plaster is to fill holes.
[157:44.52]Use ceramic.
[157:45.30]Yeah, but ceramic... These are the floor.
[158:03.32]These are wall tiles?
[158:04.56]Yeah, they...
[158:06.29]This maybe is close enough?
[158:13.81]Ceramic orange.
[158:16.04]I'm gonna try it.
[158:20.02]Drink the plaster, okay.
[158:21.92]What's gonna happen if I do that?
[158:28.42]Oh no, that's not good.
[158:33.22]I need a lighter than that.
[158:36.23]I can't... Why is it only this one color?
[158:46.96]This might be it.
[158:48.24]I think I got it.
[158:54.01]No.
[159:00.27]Garfield House.
[159:02.66]No.
[159:11.19]I gotta get this right.
[159:11.89]This is important.
[159:21.10]The tiles are too small.
[159:23.56]What about this one?
[159:24.56]This could be it.
[159:25.86]This could be close.
[159:26.48]No.
[159:50.09]People don't use ceramic on the exterior.
[159:52.94]Yeah, but I'm trying to find the closest thing to the house that I'm trying to make.
[159:59.78]It's either wood, ceramic, or tile.
[160:03.45]Those are the only three materials that exist in this game.
[160:06.27]Do I want... or brick.
[160:22.93]Yeah, but the brick just looks... This is like the pizza house again.
[160:26.09]I'm just gonna lightly paint it.
[160:33.88]But what is this?
[160:36.60]What are these?
[160:40.24]What tiles are these?
[160:41.29]Which ones are these?
[160:41.99]I don't see these anywhere.
[160:43.25]What are these called?
[160:59.46]Is this just concrete slabs on the side of the house?
[161:10.00]It's a paving slab.
[161:23.97]Can you even paint over concrete?
[161:30.58]I wish there was like exterior walls Just brick This is just this these two colors of brick I
[162:00.40]Sidon?
[162:01.48]No.
[162:10.91]Package of panels.
[162:13.19]Package of panels.
[162:14.95]Yeah, but it's all these, like, Dracula walls.
[162:20.80]I'm gonna have to paint it.
[162:34.08]Yeah, this is a Dracula wall.
[162:35.66]That's the inside of Dracula's coffin.
[162:37.42]So is that.
[162:38.60]So is this, and so is this.
[162:39.59]Alright, let's see.
[162:43.23]Let's take a look at what these look like.
[162:49.55]I think this is it.
[162:50.89]This is it.
[162:51.55]And it doesn't matter.
[162:52.39]This is what I'm using.
[162:56.37]This is close enough.
[162:58.03]Yeah, close enough.
[163:16.73]House is not ruined.
[163:17.59]It's going to look fine.
[163:23.97]Just wait.
[163:25.75]I'm making my desert getaway.
[163:41.03]You're not in the desert.
[163:44.27]Yes, I am.
[163:50.13]There's no... Do you see any town symbols or anything here?
[164:00.96]I could be anywhere.
[164:03.30]I am where I choose to be.
[164:04.82]This is my fantasy.
[164:10.71]I can fantasize about wherever I want to be.
[164:12.87]It's the digital internet world.
[164:15.95]And I fantasize to be right in the same place that I currently am in right now.
[164:20.06]Pretty boring.
[164:33.79]It's coming together.
[164:34.87]It's coming together.
[164:35.64]I already know what it looks like.
[164:51.04]Cheesecake-flavored brick house.
[164:55.68]You guys are judgmental.
[164:57.78]I wonder what your exterior walls look like.
[165:03.09]What does your house look like?
[165:04.51]And why is this here?
[165:05.47]Are these made out of, like, bleach?
[165:11.32]Why is the grass dead?
[165:24.61]Oh, better than your house.
[165:25.85]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[165:35.16]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[165:40.86]Look up stone.
[165:41.80]Uh, no, it's too late.
[165:45.62]This is fine.
[165:46.14]This will look nice.
[165:47.49]Once I get it all done.
[165:49.19]I think I need a stairway, though, to do this.
[165:57.50]Because I'm not, like, 30 feet tall.
[166:14.26]No, it's gonna look nice.
[166:18.52]Don't crash.
[166:22.61]You're talking that you are what?
[166:24.81]24 what?
[166:25.41]34 what do you mean?
[166:31.79]First of all.
[166:35.26]Get all these napkins out of the way.
[166:54.11]Paint the windowsills dark.
[166:55.25]Yeah, the idea is I want to paint these like a red.
[166:58.14]Like a maroonish.
[167:00.26]Like orange maroon.
[167:22.34]Yeah, like rust red.
[167:23.40]Yeah, that sounds good.
[167:25.72]See, you get it.
[167:26.42]You get it.
[167:26.72]You understand.
[167:27.22]You get, like, the, like, this is like a house in the desert.
[167:30.06]This is like Vegas, Arizona.
[167:32.84]You get it.
[167:34.18]God.
[167:35.14]VIP that guy.
[167:50.90]Shower tiles alright settle down settle down Nevada and Arizona where boomers go to retire and We're sick fucking awesome dudes in their 30s go and have like a blast and have like tons of fuck cool things to do and like cool fun days and
[168:28.75]Get rid of these fucking square hot dogs.
[168:39.50]I can't believe you guys are making fun of this and you wanted me to have the hot dog house.
[168:46.88]Okay.
[168:47.98]Well, just make sure we're clear on that.
[168:50.54]Pick that one.
[168:51.04]Pick that one.
[168:51.66]The hot dog house.
[168:52.48]Like, the grilled hot dog.
[168:56.90]Fine.
[168:57.08]Fine.
[169:19.84]Is it true that Americans eat whole butter bars as a snack?
[169:25.60]I think I can answer this.
[169:26.36]I'm American here.
[169:29.64]I don't know what that is.
[169:31.33]What's a butter bar?
[169:32.49]I don't know what that is.
[169:35.99]I love how it's something I'm supposed to be eating as a snack, and I've never heard of it before.
[169:40.23]Is it a sardine?
[169:41.29]Is it I eat?
[169:52.40]Well, actually, like, no fucking around.
[169:54.24]What is it?
[169:56.25]It's a stick of butter?
[170:00.19]What the fuck?
[170:03.54]I've never heard of that.
[170:04.84]A stick of butter.
[170:07.26]It's a bar of butter.
[170:10.93]I feel like this is some fantasy world made-up thing.
[170:15.95]I've never come across anyone in my entire life that's ever eaten a stick of butter for a snack.
[170:37.94]No fucking way.
[170:38.66]No way.
[170:40.86]Yeah, no way.
[170:43.08]I agree.
[170:45.94]Okay.
[170:47.98]Yeah, if I'm gonna paint this, can I paint these?
[170:50.48]I hope I can, otherwise this is a pain in the ass.
[170:53.52]Okay.
[171:03.43]Okay, looks good.
[171:08.06]This stray window is driving me crazy.
[171:13.10]Oh, yeah.
[171:15.22]That is really weird.
[171:19.10]Yeah, but I also said this is weird, but this is not weird.
[171:23.37]The stray window right there, but like the back door and then the other back door.
[171:28.07]Two huge sliders that are right here.
[171:30.41]That's not strange.
[171:31.39]And a window.
[171:31.82]What?
[171:32.12]That's not weird.
[171:36.08]This is not the garage.
[171:47.60]Oh, come on.
[172:00.46]Garage to the backyard.
[172:02.57]No, the garage is right there.
[172:04.03]I'm going to make that look real nice too.
[172:07.17]I'm telling you, this is a whole entire project and it's going to look good.
[172:13.25]And I want comparison photos.
[172:15.05]Hopefully somebody took them.
[172:17.07]I didn't.
[172:27.39]Just get a ladder.
[172:28.33]They don't exist in this video game.
[172:30.95]Don't cut that.
[172:31.55]Alright.
[172:38.31]Gotta get up here.
[172:44.89]Sometimes you gotta do the tedious work.
[172:47.37]I'm not selling this house, by the way.
[172:49.09]This is mine.
[172:50.67]Somebody wants to come take this from me?
[172:53.29]You'll have to take it from my cold, unused hands.
[173:08.55]I gotta go up.
[173:09.85]I gotta bring one of these with me.
[173:13.25]What the fuck?
[173:14.37]Oh.
[173:14.47]I was like, why is it bleached?
[173:26.24]No pictures?
[173:28.06]No, there's no pictures.
[173:30.70]I'm currently putting up new exterior walls.
[173:34.67]Sorry, there's no paintings on the wall yet.
[173:38.01]I'm not selling... who's that person?
[173:39.13]I'm not selling to that person.
[173:41.33]Even if they're the top bidder.
[173:42.13]Okay.
[173:53.24]It's gonna kind of be impossible, isn't it?
[173:57.48]I actually am gonna have to build those stair things.
[174:08.37]Yeah, I am.
[174:08.61]I'm not going to be able to get the last two or three.
[174:18.14]First of all, let me do this.
[174:21.61]Let's get a good rust color here.
[174:25.17]Copper coin.
[174:25.89]We'll try it.
[174:29.63]And then we'll also try... Viscuit?
[174:37.05]No, biscuit's too light.
[174:41.66]Cream.
[174:42.76]Mmm.
[174:46.82]Raspberry?
[174:47.30]It's probably going to be nice.
[174:49.52]The copper coin.
[174:50.14]Let's try pale pink.
[174:52.89]This is kind of like rust.
[174:54.53]Let's see.
[175:00.35]Let's see what this looks like out here.
[175:05.64]Oh no, that's not good.
[175:09.02]I can't paint these.
[175:26.99]Fuck.
[175:30.43]You can't do new windows either.
[175:35.94]There's no such thing.
[175:43.78]I can't, like, replace them.
[175:48.63]No!
[175:53.75]No!
[175:55.17]Why?
[175:57.21]No, this does look bad because of the gray.
[176:01.71]Oh, fuck.
[176:08.40]If I could do a rust or a red, like a maroon, it would look so much better.
[176:16.86]It... Oh well.
[176:18.17]Too late.
[176:20.11]We're just gonna have to do it.
[176:22.43]That's just the way it is.
[176:27.73]I can't paint these windows out here, no.
[176:34.91]That's unfortunate.
[176:37.29]Well...
[176:39.45]Let's go ahead and do stairs so I can at least finish it.
[177:09.54]Why do I have to do this?
[177:22.34]Here we go again.
[177:23.02]I didn't even bring the damn things up here.
[177:28.12]How am I gonna do this?
[177:39.80]Oh, come on.
[177:40.94]Gonna do more?
[177:43.58]Ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder.
[177:53.63]What the?
[177:56.76]This ladder's tiny!
[178:16.09]That's not gonna work?
[178:20.55]This is so much higher!
[178:24.99]Scaffolding?
[178:25.79]I don't- No, I don't.
[178:29.43]What?!
[178:38.36]Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.
[178:40.42]I still need to-
[178:51.71]Alright, give me the damn thing.
[178:57.48]Oh, what an eyesore!
[179:02.83]Alright, I'm gonna tell you what I would do if this was my house.
[179:05.57]Do you see- I would just take one of these panels and flip it horizontal and cover the whole thing.
[179:11.04]Like, does it really matter?
[179:30.67]Bricks would be the wrong way.
[179:32.54]The customer wouldn't even know.
[179:35.78]I would get away with that.
[179:37.14]In a heartbeat.
[179:46.86]Uh, what's going on up there?
[179:48.24]It looks like the bricks are the wrong way.
[179:50.58]No, that's just the sun.
[179:51.74]Reflection from the sun.
[179:52.70]It's an optical illusion.
[179:57.13]Uh, that'd be a check, please.
[179:58.35]That's a check.
[179:59.61]I take checks only.
[180:01.15]Actually, I'm just kidding.
[180:02.27]I take cash only.
[180:07.73]Alright.
[180:15.90]Well, I can't do the thing I wanted to do.
[180:20.74]What happened here?
[180:23.94]Is the grass growing through the rocks?
[180:30.35]Why is that happening?
[180:35.13]What is going on here?
[180:56.32]There's nothing even there.
[181:02.04]Alright, let's do this.
[181:10.76]Can I just get bricks?
[181:12.51]I don't think I can do brick.
[181:15.51]I can... No, I can't.
[181:24.59]Maybe this.
[181:29.05]That's kind of huge, though.
[181:39.93]No, that's absurd.
[181:41.69]Let's see.
[181:55.26]Stone... These ones.
[181:57.80]Herringbone.
[182:04.78]Ooh, wait a minute.
[182:05.54]Okay, hold on.
[182:13.05]Hold on.
[182:29.79]No, this has got to be a different color.
[182:32.67]They're huge, too.
[182:33.99]They're really big.
[182:39.33]Like, too big.
[182:41.89]What we got in colors in here?
[182:42.87]It's just gold bars.
[182:50.53]No, that's very out of place.
[183:02.37]That's better, but...
[183:08.62]Which way should this be facing?
[183:10.89]I would've ran.
[183:36.86]Use bricks?
[183:37.82]There are no bricks.
[183:40.32]I can't lay bricks down.
[183:41.46]It's only these.
[183:45.08]Like, brick... Like, these... But look.
[183:49.45]It's like a stack of them.
[183:52.49]It doesn't work.
[184:10.65]Get rid of this stuff.
[184:20.29]I can make it do stones.
[184:21.73]I can do this.
[184:28.43]This doesn't look terrible.
[184:44.43]I feel like I should flip that.
[184:57.67]That just looks like this.
[184:58.35]Let's see.
[185:14.04]This needs to be a different color, then.
[185:22.19]Hmm.
[185:22.77]I don't know.
[185:23.23]That actually doesn't look bad.
[185:24.31]That actually doesn't look bad.
[185:30.78]I don't hate this.
[185:46.70]That doesn't look bad.
[185:47.57]Yeah, hold on here.
[185:52.77]This looks okay.
[186:00.81]Or was it like this?
[186:04.88]Yeah, like a little bit over the edge.
[186:08.02]Like this.
[186:15.24]Was it in a little bit more?
[186:18.13]That's not matching up.
[186:19.29]That's not matching up.
[186:20.04]I'm gonna freak out.
[186:22.30]I'm gonna freak out.
[186:23.26]That's not matching up.
[186:28.36]Needs to be in a little more.
[186:29.12]Yeah, it needs to come in like a half an inch.
[186:55.68]Now what do I do here?
[186:57.94]I can't just do that again.
[186:58.96]It'll look awkward, won't it?
[187:04.02]No, I can't do this trick more than once.
[187:12.15]Couple of stones.
[187:12.81]Maybe some rocks?
[187:13.45]Maybe some bigger stones?
[187:23.36]put like a plant bed maybe let's see what let's see what looks like with rocks um okay rock no I don't what are you doing
[187:45.17]Some big stones.
[187:47.40]Stepping stone.
[187:48.18]Chopped.
[187:48.58]No.
[187:48.90]Stepping stone.
[187:49.54]Chopped.
[187:51.72]Small.
[187:52.86]This is kind of an erratic pattern.
[187:53.97]How big is it?
[187:55.35]Oh, big like ice crystals.
[187:56.95]Let's see what this looks like.
[188:15.47]Smaller.
[188:21.65]And a little darker.
[188:26.43]Can I make them... Uh, how about this one?
[188:32.19]Alright, hold on, wait, hold on, this is important.
[188:42.66]Should I do them spread out, or should I have them kind of right in a line?
[188:55.87]No, it's ugly.
[189:01.08]I think I need more stone.
[189:05.72]I need, like, something... I need... Pebble?
[189:13.54]Wait a minute.
[189:17.79]Ooh...
[189:32.44]Why are these different colors?
[189:33.24]Just put rocks all over the whole yard?
[190:04.88]So I need like a flower bed.
[190:06.69]No, no, no everybody.
[190:09.25]I got it I'm gonna make a line of flowers
[190:34.57]I wish this was even 20% smaller.
[191:19.62]I think I can just hide it with a couple of little bushes.
[191:25.54]Twix bar!
[191:27.96]You guys are so judgmental!
[191:30.48]Now I'm gonna do some small bushes.
[191:31.70]A line of small bushes.
[191:36.82]How big are these?
[191:44.84]Some orange?
[191:46.47]That might not look terrible.
[191:49.11]This is huge, though.
[192:00.60]One of these?
[192:01.04]Yeah, there are no cactuses in the game, unfortunately.
[192:05.38]They do not exist.
[192:11.08]When these are in the ground... No, they need to be smaller.
[192:22.13]They're too overbearing.
[192:25.80]I think I'm just going to say fuck it.
[192:32.28]Here we go.
[192:42.01]Got it.
[193:20.20]Along the whole thing.
[193:25.20]Let's just see how these look at first.
[193:26.34]Hold on.
[193:34.44]Alright.
[193:34.80]Yeah, I'll take care of the corner.
[193:38.98]I just want to make sure this looks alright.
[193:45.50]Yeah, this'll be alright.
[193:54.95]Looks better than the rocks.
[193:55.83]Yeah, it does.
[194:09.62]Yeah, that looks fine.
[194:16.79]Well, that brightened up here.
[194:26.50]Leave the holes and see if anything else gets planted.
[194:29.34]Like, while my time off, it's like, ah, see you later.
[194:31.06]I'm going to see what happens.
[194:34.66]I think I know.
[194:35.40]Alright.
[194:36.26]And then we're going to do... One big bush here.
[194:42.95]One big bush here.
[194:43.93]Different bushes, though.
[194:45.11]So the symmetrical people that don't like the symmetrical stuff, you know, they'll have some say in this.
[195:09.67]Spray hose in house.
[195:11.37]Ah, we already did that yesterday.
[195:12.53]We did that joke already.
[195:16.75]Just get rid of the shitty gravel.
[195:18.85]I like the gravel.
[195:21.87]I like the stone.
[195:23.07]I like it.
[195:25.36]Once there's a bush over here and a bush over there, it'll look a lot nicer.
[195:28.58]I like it.
[195:34.06]I like stone.
[195:40.95]You don't like stone?
[195:48.23]Raisins.
[195:49.86]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[196:08.69]That was for the guy that said to do that.
[196:09.91]Alright.
[196:11.07]hey look at that we need something little right there something little right here something big something big and then we'll the front door will be done and we only have like another entire the five acres to do okay
[196:38.36]I'm going with something big.
[196:39.94]Large.
[196:41.22]Very large.
[196:43.08]Oh, fuck yeah.
[196:44.86]Oh, fucking hell yeah.
[196:48.01]I almost did it.
[197:17.41]Fucking hell yeah Look we got up we got down
[197:51.74]This looks fucking dumb, LOL.
[197:53.25]Alright, thanks.
[197:59.67]I think it looks cool.
[198:13.17]I'm not even done.
[198:13.95]You think I'm done?
[198:15.81]I'm not even close to being done.
[198:19.49]Now we're going to get some more... Kind of like almost pinkish.
[198:26.20]Like somewhere in between orange and red.
[198:30.94]Right here.
[198:31.38]Right here.
[198:33.69]Right here.
[198:34.23]Right here.
[198:44.23]Let's go with plants.
[198:53.57]I wish I could change the color.
[198:54.49]Oh.
[198:57.33]Oh, I think so.
[199:00.77]Oh, I think so.
[199:01.41]Are these the same color as these?
[199:03.57]Damn it.
[199:03.91]Never mind.
[199:22.64]Wait a minute.
[199:23.30]Oh, no.
[199:25.58]Should I?
[199:25.86]Is this too much?
[199:28.13]This might be too much.
[199:29.59]Is this too much?
[200:34.72]Too much?
[200:35.57]Is that too much?
[200:38.31]Too much.
[200:39.41]Yeah, it is.
[200:41.97]Oh, you dickhead.
[200:43.51]Why?
[200:43.77]Something has to go there.
[200:52.34]I'm almost done.
[200:52.98]Just need a little flower.
[200:56.76]Just something small.
[200:57.72]Something little.
[200:58.42]Something that really just brings it all together.
[201:01.27]Like one of these.
[201:05.01]Get in there.
[201:06.87]Come on, get right in there.
[201:07.99]I might not even need it.
[201:29.51]I might not need it.
[201:31.47]I think I'm done with the front here.
[201:33.37]I need to put something a little over there.
[201:47.59]Ah, what do I... I don't... I have no idea.
[201:53.26]These... I don't... I don't know.
[201:55.86]I don't know what these are.
[201:59.12]That's too... Wait, hold on.
[202:38.17]I just got lost for a second, hold on.
[202:45.83]Tree... Spherical tree... Plum tree... Maybe one big tree on the right over here?
[202:56.08]Just a huge tree?
[202:57.12]A very big one.
[203:02.91]Like one of these huge ones.
[203:11.60]Oh, that's enormous.
[203:16.38]No, that's a- it's like a giant pineapple in my house.
[203:22.27]Small.
[203:22.91]It's gotta be smaller than that.
[203:24.59]Here we go.
[203:26.51]That's better.
[203:39.52]Right here?
[203:43.89]That dumb tree wasn't there.
[203:54.61]Start a riot.
[203:55.41]Our palm tree isn't here.
[203:56.86]Hey, relax.
[204:00.40]You already have one.
[204:03.56]No, we need to have a walkway going over here to the right.
[204:07.12]Yeah, there's nothing over here.
[204:07.98]There's going to be the walkway...
[204:12.74]I don't know.
[204:14.40]No, it's like a little pool or something.
[204:16.36]I don't know.
[204:16.68]How about a rich person fountain?
[204:23.40]Something ridiculous, like right here.
[204:27.64]A projector to the house?
[204:31.30]Outdoor cinema screen?
[204:38.58]A fire pit?
[204:40.07]That goes in the back.
[204:41.15]No, Jeremy!
[204:42.19]No!
[204:43.21]That goes in the back!
[204:45.87]I'm sorry.
[204:46.23]Okay, front.
[204:46.69]I thought it was front yard.
[204:47.47]No, it's backyard!
[204:48.83]Okay.
[204:50.69]How about, um... Playground, but I don't have any kids.
[204:59.80]Swing set is very homey, but... No, no kids.
[205:07.09]I like the recreation.
[205:09.51]Accessories, fire pits, hammocks, maybe.
[205:18.04]No.
[205:19.02]Back it up.
[205:20.14]Decorations.
[205:25.89]A Japanese lantern?
[205:50.95]Which do you prefer?
[205:54.47]On the outside or right on the inside?
[205:58.43]Or in the gravel here?
[206:06.31]Number one, number two, or number three?
[206:11.19]It'll give you good view.
[206:11.75]I'm seeing a lot of threes.
[206:24.79]Alright, looks like it's gonna be three.
[206:33.79]How many?
[206:35.66]How many steps?
[206:37.48]Like here?
[206:48.83]One, two, three, four, five or four?
[207:02.73]You're gonna wanna fucking come to my house.
[207:14.51]Uneven.
[207:15.01]Uneven.
[207:15.57]Fuck.
[207:28.24]You don't wanna come to my smelly house?
[207:31.17]There's nothing in here yet.
[207:32.29]How could you tell it smells like anything?
[207:41.16]Oh, come on, game.
[207:42.06]What are you doing?
[207:42.76]Why can I not play?
[207:43.48]Am I standing on it?
[207:55.01]Huh?
[207:55.21]Oh my god, please.
[208:05.98]Straight down.
[208:06.60]There we go.
[208:09.82]I can just do it like that.
[208:14.64]Everyone's gonna want to come to my house.
[208:16.71]I can already just see the invitations I send out.
[208:20.59]BYOB!
[208:29.26]Goddammit, this is wrong.
[208:30.50]Um...
[208:46.01]It's not wrong.
[208:48.41]Which one of these is wrong?
[208:49.55]This one?
[208:55.86]It's that one.
[208:56.62]It's these two.
[208:57.14]How do I turn them on?
[209:21.53]Yeah!
[209:23.55]Oh, I'm so fucking happy!
[209:28.52]Okay.
[209:32.22]I actually don't mind this, but it needs to move.
[209:43.18]This tree right here is really fucking it all up.
[209:44.75]You know what I mean?
[209:47.73]This doesn't look right.
[209:48.43]Because of the tree.
[209:54.32]It looks better.
[210:01.79]Your front lawn's gonna have so many bugs.
[210:05.19]Unfortunately, I have to patch that up, so... Well, the thing is, you're missing pizza ovens.
[210:15.90]This is the one, right?
[210:19.94]No, it's bigger stone.
[210:24.30]Wait, that is the big one.
[210:26.52]Why does this look so odd?
[210:27.48]Oh, there we go.
[210:31.00]We're good.
[210:32.39]Any little patches I need to do?
[210:35.09]Maybe come out a little, too.
[210:36.45]Just to make it so it's more natural here.
[210:38.69]Right on the edge.
[210:42.09]Maybe have this come out here a little more.
[210:45.97]Like here, and then go out and around.
[210:50.27]Hear me out.
[210:59.49]I fucked it up.
[211:00.83]Saved it.
[211:02.81]No, I didn't.
[211:05.65]Fuck.
[211:05.85]Can I crouch?
[211:45.61]No, why?
[211:48.75]Oh, god damn it.
[211:50.29]Well, fuck, whatever.
[211:53.33]At least I can clean it up now.
[212:07.50]That looks natural now.
[212:10.12]Yeah, and then I can just put that one here and hide the bullshit that I just did.
[212:14.29]What was the name of this thing?
[212:17.28]What are these called?
[212:17.84]I forget.
[212:19.77]Go back up into the sky.
[212:21.01]That was funny.
[212:23.93]What were those things called?
[212:24.93]These?
[212:25.35]What were they?
[212:29.09]No, they'll have like a palm tree garden in the back.
[212:40.13]Anyone remember what those were called?
[212:53.04]What were those called?
[213:05.95]I think you had to plant them, right?
[213:09.43]What the hell were those things called?
[213:10.61]Not these.
[213:11.77]I think it was at the top.
[213:13.83]I think I had it already.
[213:14.65]Spring?
[213:25.64]Um, damn it.
[213:26.56]What the hell are these called?
[213:29.96]Spreading bush?
[213:34.19]You got it.
[213:34.57]I think that's the one, right?
[213:37.99]Yeah, this is correct.
[213:40.79]Let's get this in a good spot, though.
[213:46.58]I'm thinking, like, right here.
[213:47.68]Right there.
[213:48.88]There.
[214:03.39]These are, like, not even.
[214:04.25]There's, like, a little too much space here.
[214:06.84]This is a retirement drug den.
[214:14.24]That's not the same thing.
[214:18.68]That's not even the same bush.
[214:20.85]That is not correct.
[214:22.49]And it looks very close.
[214:23.93]Is it?
[214:27.71]Is that the same thing?
[214:32.87]No, this one's not the same thing.
[214:43.48]This is called Acer Palmatum.
[214:48.20]Was there another color?
[214:50.42]It is this one.
[215:10.18]Alright.
[215:11.60]Now... That we have the front... Front pretty much done.
[215:20.04]I would call this... This is pretty close to, like, nice garden, dude.
[215:22.89]I need something right here, though.
[215:30.01]Like, nice job, man.
[215:31.89]Is what I would say to the person that made this if they were in the 9th grid.
[215:38.05]Um...
[215:39.93]Columns?
[215:41.86]Pond, that would be good, yeah.
[215:54.24]One of these ones?
[215:55.20]Let's make it a good color.
[216:00.52]Which way?
[216:00.98]Facing how?
[216:01.64]Facing around the tree, I think.
[216:07.18]That would be kind of nice, right?
[216:08.46]And maybe put something next to it?
[216:13.11]It's a hot tub.
[216:14.59]This is not a hot tub.
[216:17.91]I think right up here against this tree.
[216:22.27]And if you don't like it, you can just go watch another stream.
[216:26.07]You know what I'm saying?
[216:36.48]How long is it going to take to dig?
[216:39.98]Alright then.
[216:43.97]You're making a skate park?
[216:45.95]What?
[216:51.26]Oh, you actually have to fill it with water?
[216:52.78]I thought it was rain.
[216:56.44]The pond was mounted and filled.
[216:57.72]I'm just kidding.
[217:03.08]Alright, now this is bad.
[217:05.06]Because this needs to be, like, bigger.
[217:07.52]There needs to be something around it.
[217:12.65]This is how it starts.
[217:13.57]Now I know what gardening's like.
[217:15.13]Yeah, the tree fucked it all up.
[217:20.93]It needs to be bigger.
[217:23.25]I'm gonna do the big one.
[217:40.66]Dude, if that fucking tree wasn't here...
[217:44.24]If that tree wasn't here, this is perfect.
[217:49.46]I can go this way.
[217:55.50]Yeah, but I don't want to put it here, though.
[217:56.76]People will drive by and throw cigarette butts in here.
[218:00.57]You know how many baseballs are going to go in here?
[218:03.61]It can't be this close.
[218:12.43]No, it's got to be the smaller ones.
[218:17.23]Um, does this one though?
[218:18.13]What does this one look like?
[218:24.46]This one's okay.
[218:35.10]It's cool looking, yeah.
[218:39.82]Oh, shit.
[218:41.16]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[218:42.74]Do not go into here.
[218:44.66]Remove, please.
[218:46.95]Please remove.
[218:48.91]Cancel.
[218:51.77]Cancel, please.
[219:02.88]I just want something to like be right here or something.
[219:05.04]Hold on.
[219:05.32]How does that look?
[219:16.77]Could put something right here.
[219:18.01]Let me just see what it looks like.
[219:18.99]Yeah, I can't delete the tree.
[219:24.08]It's there forever.
[219:27.80]That's not bad.
[219:39.79]Wait a second.
[219:44.55]Wait a minute.
[219:47.57]Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
[220:19.28]I'll put, like, another fucking tree or bush over here.
[220:26.58]That's okay.
[220:27.99]I'm okay with that.
[220:29.07]We'll put, like, a little something.
[220:30.11]I need, like, enough space to walk this way, though.
[220:31.95]Yeah, there's enough room.
[220:50.02]Alright.
[220:52.46]What goes over here?
[220:53.76]How about a big, huge pond?
[220:55.42]Like right here.
[220:56.08]No, that's too much.
[220:57.52]More pond than house.
[221:01.98]Do more pond.
[221:11.98]A huge fountain.
[221:15.38]A Paris fountain.
[221:18.15]No, I'm going to put a couple of little shrubs like here and like one here and here.
[221:26.19]Can we get like a preliminary screenshot here?
[221:30.84]Just real quick.
[221:32.18]That looks pretty nice.
[221:42.62]Something nice, something cool, something interesting.
[221:46.40]Something daring.
[221:49.92]A giant gnome.
[221:53.26]I'll put him here.
[221:53.96]He belongs over here.
[221:59.95]In the pool?
[222:00.71]In the water?
[222:01.21]There's a little spot back here.
[222:09.79]That's cute.
[222:10.39]Right here.
[222:13.02]Yeah.
[222:13.70]I think so.
[222:22.50]Sculptures.
[222:25.28]Wait a minute.
[223:13.66]So you can sit on the rocks!
[223:19.01]You can sit down on the rock and just chill.
[223:25.29]Hold on.
[223:26.03]Move this one a little bit over here.
[223:34.85]Put something right in the middle.
[223:36.39]Got a little seat rock.
[223:41.72]What do you mean no one will do that?
[223:42.70]You wouldn't sit on that?
[224:05.93]They're drinking out of the pond.
[224:08.57]Put a goddamn tire swing.
[224:10.39]Hold on.
[224:46.79]By the way, half the shit's gonna get stolen.
[224:50.38]Someone's gonna walk up here and just fucking take these.
[224:59.14]That's why I would never have something like this.
[225:01.79]Someone would just reach over the fence and take it and walk away.
[225:10.27]Need to get a juped up security system.
[225:15.59]This is so cute.
[225:16.85]Look at how nice this looks.
[225:20.46]Look at that.
[225:21.04]Don't, don't take a picture yet.
[225:27.88]Don't, that, oh, that don't look good.
[225:30.33]Ooh.
[225:32.73]That was like your mother came over to give her a tour of your new place and everything looks so nice and pretty and you cleaned up but for some reason something a coin drops on the ground and it rolls underneath the couch and you have the panic attack where she's gonna look under the couch and she's like oh let me get that coin
[225:57.20]No, don't get it!
[225:59.12]And you try to race her to get the coin.
[226:00.54]Everything's in slow motion.
[226:01.88]And she finds all the dirt that you sweep under the couch because you don't feel like putting it in the trash.
[226:18.41]And all the porn DVDs that you sweep under the couch.
[226:32.73]I could make a whole D&D game.
[226:34.45]Pour out the water!
[226:47.24]Like, the birds are fine.
[226:49.92]Can I paint them?
[226:52.25]I think the front yard is done.
[226:53.63]I do.
[226:54.05]Maybe we'll come back and clean it up a little bit.
[226:58.29]Wait, most importantly.
[226:59.51]Come on, it looks like a welcome mat.
[227:07.91]This is the worst game on Steam.
[227:10.17]I think so.
[227:16.36]Alright.
[227:17.16]Furniture.
[227:17.60]Ooh, wait a minute.
[227:22.52]Just Matt.
[227:26.40]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[227:28.22]Look at these.
[227:29.60]Come on.
[227:29.94]You tell me I'm not going to have these two.
[227:37.57]That's in the way.
[227:49.76]Something's gonna be like right here.
[227:52.94]It's looking a little too busy, is it?
[227:54.34]You think so?
[227:59.84]Yeah, you know, it is getting a little busy.
[228:01.36]It's getting busy.
[228:02.34]It's getting a little too busy.
[228:04.50]You are right.
[228:06.88]Yeah, this is getting busy.
[228:08.26]This is getting very busy.
[228:10.98]Yeah, this is becoming... This is becoming hotel lobby busy.
[228:17.01]Alright.
[228:17.57]Yeah, hold on.
[228:35.94]Too many rocks?
[228:36.56]No, I like them.
[228:38.18]I like them.
[228:39.10]I do.
[228:39.62]I really do like these.
[228:40.45]I like them a lot.
[228:44.83]Did I move that?
[228:45.25]Did I fuck it up by moving that?
[228:48.05]Maybe.
[228:48.49]No, put it back.
[229:14.95]No, no, doesn't work.
[229:18.01]No, you can sit over here.
[229:19.99]So what do we got on this side?
[229:23.45]Oh, Jesus.
[229:24.89]I don't even want to look at that.
[229:26.91]All my fucking socks and my dirt and my porn DVDs.
[229:29.59]No, I only want my mother to see the hotel lobby.
[229:35.38]It's a dump back there.
[229:36.80]Yeah, right now it is.
[229:45.83]Look at how much work there is to do.
[229:48.65]This stream's never gonna turn off.
[229:56.74]It's alright, guys.
[229:57.28]I ate sardines today.
[230:02.56]They actually, they literally, literally give you superpowers.
[230:07.73]I think I'm making that up.
[230:12.21]That's not a joke.
[230:12.73]I'm not making a joke.
[230:13.33]They actually give you superpowers.
[230:14.74]It's real.
[230:16.26]Start eating him.
[230:16.68]I'm serious.
[230:36.85]Mole?
[230:40.03]No, that's not a mole.
[230:43.29]Where's the mole?
[230:44.31]Are these mole tracks?
[230:53.24]All mole mounds are gone.
[230:55.08]Mole's gone.
[231:00.04]Mole's gone.
[231:01.45]We're fine.
[231:07.95]It is so easy to eat, too.
[231:10.55]I would take a sardine sponsorship.
[231:12.07]I probably would.
[231:17.13]The only sponsorship you would ever see on this channel would be for, like, sardine cans.
[231:35.05]Ever have them on crackers?
[231:35.93]I have not.
[231:36.57]I've had it on toast, though.
[231:37.63]Oh, what a great idea.
[231:38.63]I can't wait to do that tomorrow.
[231:45.24]Streamer ate sardines once and is now hooked for life.
[231:54.70]I hate him like today.
[231:55.74]Oh, they give you superpowers.
[231:58.76]I had him today.
[232:01.73]What a placebo effect.
[232:04.57]I could do anything.
[232:05.87]I think I could probably fly.
[232:09.17]Jerma, do not get up there.
[232:11.19]No, I had sardines today, man.
[232:13.17]I think I can do it.
[232:29.81]You versus the guy she told you not to care about.
[232:59.27]He's losing it.
[233:03.01]It was already gone before you got here.
[233:04.69]Don't worry.
[233:08.04]What else?
[233:08.52]There's a lot of weeds over here.
[233:10.58]It's hard to get around these trees.
[233:29.70]Speaking of trees... Why can I sell these ones, but I can't get rid of the huge annoying ones that are all over the place in the ground?
[233:58.58]Well, it's almost clean.
[234:00.90]And mowed.
[234:02.60]Almost.
[234:02.96]Do a sardine review?
[234:05.80]I already did.
[234:09.59]I've been doing it every hour.
[234:16.13]I've already done that.
[234:16.87]Let's make this side of the house a swamp.
[234:34.43]What brand do I get?
[234:35.31]The one with the guy that looks like Dr. Roker.
[234:50.76]Yes, somebody did say that.
[234:51.90]Why would I even say that?
[234:59.42]We're a 100% clean...
[235:03.17]As of right... No, not yet.
[235:04.53]Hold on.
[235:05.19]Hold that thought.
[235:05.67]You have to eat a sardine and show your superpowers.
[235:16.27]Um... Are these dog bowls considered... Is this considered, like, dirty?
[235:36.05]I know.
[235:36.57]You just deleted the dog house!
[235:38.31]The dog house!
[235:40.33]What about the dog?
[235:41.71]Oh, don't worry.
[235:43.05]I knew it.
[235:43.63]I told you.
[235:44.93]I'm just going to put down grass here and put the dog park back.
[235:52.23]I knew that was going to happen.
[235:53.07]You can never delete a dog house on stream.
[236:03.04]Yes.
[236:04.84]Yeah, I think so.
[236:06.03]I do.
[236:06.27]It needs a door.
[236:08.67]That's what's missing.
[236:18.96]Mmm... White?
[236:37.85]Why is this so fat?
[236:43.87]This doesn't look right.
[236:44.67]Why is this too big?
[236:47.31]Okay.
[237:28.76]Hey, and then that, hold on, it's not done yet.
[237:34.09]Stop screaming at me, it's not done.
[238:13.13]Now it's a home.
[238:17.37]Except for the left, back, and right side of the house.
[238:22.75]What are we gonna do over here?
[238:23.45]I'm gonna have something fun over here.
[238:24.52]Definitely gonna have like a barbecue section.
[238:35.02]Do a roller coaster.
[238:37.56]Make the dog park?
[238:38.22]I could have a little dog park over here.
[238:40.28]Yeah, I'll have like a little separate dog place.
[238:43.56]Hold on, there's definitely trash everywhere in here.
[238:49.37]This is clean.
[239:05.96]Is there a car?
[239:25.30]The house comes with a car?
[239:28.72]Um... I just want a car in here.
[239:36.52]They got a pool table?
[239:40.86]They got a ball pit.
[239:44.23]That's too small.
[239:44.91]Alright, one step at a time.
[239:56.09]I need to do the rest of the paneling on the house.
[240:00.05]I gotta fix this dumb, stupid idea that I had.
[240:03.24]And I should be reprimanded for it.
[240:13.03]What the hell was this called?
[240:17.85]It was a panel.
[240:34.59]We must riot for a ball pit.
[240:40.29]You want me to put a ball pit in the garage?
[240:46.90]Now, I know the scaffold.
[240:47.76]I know, I know.
[240:48.46]I'm just going to do the bottom first.
[240:54.70]This doesn't look right.
[240:56.05]Yeah, it's the same one.
[241:06.48]This place isn't even dirty.
[241:07.36]I bet the outside was, but thankfully the inside is nice.
[241:13.16]We can do some decorating.
[241:21.55]We can have... Look, outside I'll make a separate little circus area.
[241:26.94]Everything's gonna be fine.
[241:30.80]I'm telling you, this is the big house.
[241:32.00]This is the one to go all in.
[241:32.92]I went all in.
[241:35.37]This stream will not stop until it's all done.
[241:40.13]All in.
[241:43.67]I'm going all in at the fucking table, dude.
[241:46.17]I've got 36 bucks at that table.
[241:49.85]All in.
[241:51.83]Everybody at the table is going to be like, oh, that's a lot.
[241:53.68]What the hell is he thinking?
[242:18.03]You and your gambling fantasies.
[242:23.91]Yeah, I mean, dude, I was thinking... I was thinking of getting a tat.
[242:29.76]Seven on one eyelid.
[242:31.24]Seven on the other eyelid.
[242:33.58]And seven on the top of my tongue.
[242:37.04]So I'll just close my eyes, stick my tongue out, and be like, ding ding ding, motherfucker!
[243:05.68]I mean the efficiency is just off the fucking charts right now.
[243:12.11]You can tell that there was some type of fish based nutrients that he took today.
[243:34.45]This is fucking up the grass, though.
[243:35.57]That's annoying.
[243:45.89]Tiles look weird.
[243:46.63]You should do brick or stucco.
[243:52.40]I think it may be far too late to change this now.
[243:57.18]These aren't tiles.
[243:57.74]They're panels.
[243:58.14]They're wall panels.
[243:59.70]Are these tiles?
[244:02.72]In this wall panel?
[244:08.17]These aren't bathroom tiles.
[244:13.73]Yeah, just these are pine panels.
[244:15.53]Yeah, these are fine.
[244:17.41]I'm not doing this again.
[244:18.73]This is like a long time.
[244:20.05]It takes a while to do this.
[244:24.80]Damn it.
[244:29.67]I know people are gonna give me shit for doing the double dare technique.
[244:34.29]And it's like, running back and forth, placing, run back over here, get some more milk!
[244:38.03]Run over here, put it inside their head with the eggs!
[244:41.48]I know.
[244:42.56]But, I'm just trying to get this done.
[244:57.21]Still on this house?
[244:59.20]I'll be on this house until the stream turns off.
[245:01.62]That is a fact.
[245:03.96]I mean, that is 100% truth.
[245:12.66]But it's going to be the greatest thing I've ever done in this game.
[245:15.75]It's going to be really well done.
[245:17.39]We're not going to put like a Best Buy in here.
[245:20.45]It's going to be a beautiful, fantastic, actually made house.
[245:24.53]With a wonderful garden, wonderful backyard play area, patio with a barbecue...
[245:29.29]A small circus, not a big one.
[245:30.91]A small circus.
[245:33.09]A dog park.
[245:35.05]And maybe a gym.
[245:37.25]It's gonna be a fun, it's gonna be a regular just house.
[246:01.47]Alright, slow down.
[246:02.07]I'm going too fast.
[246:08.19]Still gonna make a hot topic?
[246:11.33]No, not this time.
[246:20.90]Okay, almost.
[246:22.72]Getting there.
[246:23.22]Phew!
[246:26.85]It's hard work.
[246:30.28]It's hard work pretending to do hard work.
[246:32.44]Don't you guys think?
[246:33.04]Now we need the scaffolding after this.
[246:53.18]And we can do the other side too.
[246:54.30]This house is too big.
[246:57.96]How many rooms are in this house?
[247:01.12]Look at this.
[247:02.20]What is this all for?
[247:04.28]Why is there brick over here?
[247:06.18]What is this supposed to be?
[247:07.18]What is this room?
[247:08.80]Here's the front door.
[247:10.49]Got a nice garden, but, you know.
[247:12.55]Okay, front door.
[247:15.69]The closet?
[247:16.57]The den?
[247:17.47]The closet?
[247:20.71]Where you hang your coats and shoe rack?
[247:22.91]I don't know.
[247:26.29]And then... This looks like it could just be a big living room.
[247:30.17]What is this?
[247:32.01]Second weird brick room.
[247:34.58]This is not a bedroom Bathroom what would he what the hell would roomie?
[247:40.86]Why would they be brick right up here?
[247:47.37]This house sucks, there's no rooms It's just there's two brick rooms
[248:00.25]I'm gonna have to build out some bedrooms.
[248:03.15]You build the room, smart guy.
[248:04.98]Yeah, but... This... What?
[248:12.92]Look at the weird layout here.
[248:14.18]Everybody has a balcony?
[248:17.08]Up the stairs.
[248:17.66]Balcony.
[248:19.64]Whose balcony is this?
[248:20.78]Just a balcony.
[248:21.60]And then there's another balcony.
[248:29.24]You got too many balconies!
[248:34.77]I wanna, in fact, remove this balcony and turn it into a circus.
[248:39.47]That's more normal than this.
[248:44.57]Now, front balconies.
[248:45.67]I... No.
[248:46.35]I... I don't think so.
[248:47.59]Mm-mm.
[248:50.01]No front balcony.
[248:50.83]Don't think so.
[248:56.49]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[248:57.41]This is how you get sniped in Hitman.
[249:00.69]Nope.
[249:13.95]You can make it work.
[249:14.75]I'll make it work, don't worry.
[249:21.98]Yeah, that's where the target comes and smokes a cigarette for 15 seconds, and that's your opportunity.
[249:29.43]Alright, what are we doing over here?
[249:45.59]Your power's been off for two hours, that's not good.
[249:51.49]Let's get a reveal.
[249:53.16]Hold on.
[249:53.48]I need to get a big reveal.
[249:54.36]Somebody just came back after two hours.
[249:56.22]They weren't here.
[249:57.74]You ready for this?
[249:59.36]Okay.
[250:01.40]That one person that's here, you ready?
[250:03.04]They just came back.
[250:05.30]Take a look at this.
[250:06.40]You remember what it looked like before, before you left.
[250:09.56]Take a look at it now.
[250:22.27]And it's not even done.
[250:23.57]There's still much to be done.
[250:30.98]Ah, I love it.
[250:38.04]Alright, for real, I left when you were doing the Jenga thing.
[250:41.14]I came back and it looks great.
[250:42.84]See?
[250:43.94]Yeah, thank you.
[250:47.21]Yes!
[250:48.69]Welcome back.
[250:50.89]Hopefully the power situation.
[250:53.59]It's, uh, under control.
[251:00.76]Oh, come on.
[251:02.22]Yeah, we're gonna do something fun over here.
[251:10.44]We're gonna do, like, a nice circus, maybe.
[251:12.82]That's a paid actor.
[251:25.29]We should build something.
[251:26.19]Build Jenga.
[251:30.63]Wait a minute.
[251:31.45]Is there actual drop in the game?
[252:01.17]They're not the same pieces.
[252:04.23]They can't fit.
[252:07.39]It has to be two.
[252:13.20]It's not real Jenga.
[252:14.72]Unless there's three.
[252:26.44]Yeah, sorry guys.
[252:27.46]It's not real.
[252:28.16]It'll never be real.
[252:30.71]But let's just see what happens.
[252:34.16]No, there is no drop.
[252:35.12]What am I talking about?
[252:35.92]One floated in the air for like 35 minutes.
[252:54.48]How do you play Jenga with two rows?
[252:56.24]Yeah, you don't.
[252:56.98]That's what I'm saying.
[253:07.92]The panels can drop.
[253:08.92]Does it reach?
[253:22.75]Can't stack them though.
[253:25.16]I don't think they can be stacked on top of each other.
[253:27.74]No, sorry.
[253:30.90]Theory busted.
[253:39.35]Paint the top half of the house.
[253:41.25]That would look pretty odd.
[254:00.67]Two-toned house.
[254:07.99]How's the, um...
[254:09.40]How's the internet been?
[254:12.15]Looks like I haven't dropped very many frames.
[254:13.97]I mean, I still have, but... I've dropped like 3,500?
[254:17.53]Seems like it's alright.
[254:19.31]At least for today.
[254:23.27]Maybe, um... Maybe it's more manageable now that we have the new DNS and new static IP.
[254:32.02]Well, that would be really swell if that were the case.
[254:36.54]No, I said it.
[254:37.26]Now it's gonna happen.
[254:37.98]I know, right?
[254:40.21]Alright, uh, I need to put this away.
[254:44.13]I need a scaffolding.
[254:52.13]Let me buy a few of these.
[254:55.63]No, let's just get it.
[254:56.89]Let's just get this actually ready to be done in one go.
[255:02.83]Don't paint the top half.
[255:04.51]Wait, why do you think I'm gonna paint the top half?
[255:07.19]Just because somebody in chat said that?
[255:10.95]What?
[255:13.53]I'm not gonna paint the top half!
[255:20.49]I did that a lot.
[255:22.49]Not today.
[255:23.05]Today's different.
[255:43.54]I need more of these panels.
[256:07.76]No.
[256:09.40]Please fall.
[256:11.00]There's no fall damage though, so it wouldn't matter.
[256:14.29]I could fall right now, and we could just, like, laugh hysterically about me falling.
[256:18.67]Wouldn't really do anything.
[256:19.75]I'm sorry.
[256:22.31]That could be disappointing.
[256:24.64]There's no funny health meter where I could die and... You know what I mean?
[256:30.88]I know everybody's expecting... It to happen.
[256:37.21]But it's not gonna do it.
[256:44.40]Ooh!
[256:45.58]Sorry.
[256:47.59]Wait, there's more here?
[256:50.13]Why can I not... I'm not close enough to get these.
[257:05.28]That's not possible, man.
[257:06.72]Come on.
[257:16.70]Well, I have to move the scaffolding again.
[257:19.37]I mean, this is just like doing the grass.
[257:28.21]It's tedious, but once you do it, it's over.
[257:29.91]And you end up in a magazine.
[257:42.06]Gardener Weekly.
[257:57.56]Come on!
[257:58.38]That's such bullshit.
[258:07.10]Just move.
[258:17.15]Is it these things in the way?
[258:29.84]Alright, dude, how the fuck... That's even further away.
[258:34.07]I'm just gonna have to jump.
[258:51.90]Did I not get it?
[259:00.01]Got it, okay.
[259:03.03]Cool, cool, very cool, nice.
[259:12.80]Check around for bald spots.
[259:15.18]We have a few bald spots over here that I'm gonna take care of.
[259:17.38]So I just sit back and relax while I take care of these walls.
[259:40.02]And go!
[259:46.62]Come on, fill up that bucket!
[259:52.63]Come on, Anderson family!
[259:56.01]Okay, that's it!
[259:59.33]How many panels did you get up?
[260:04.74]God damn it, there's an entire side of the fucking house.
[260:11.83]I just got insane deja vu right now.
[260:15.63]Right here.
[260:18.01]Why?
[260:18.23]Did I miss one up here?
[260:35.85]No, I got it.
[260:37.07]I'm good.
[260:47.77]is this, though.
[260:56.44]Oh, that was gonna be just barely a perfect exact number.
[261:00.32]And it wasn't.
[261:02.48]Well, this is gonna take so long.
[261:07.67]I can do that when I go upstairs.
[261:09.47]I gotta bring this over here.
[261:14.51]Too much paneling.
[261:30.62]I'm gonna do the inside and the lawn on the house.
[261:34.26]I'm prepared.
[261:34.84]I am very prepared for it.
[261:45.26]Wake up, wake up.
[261:46.16]Painting is so much quicker as sandstone, cocking, and just roll of that shit on.
[261:51.60]Yeah.
[261:53.69]But it would look pretty ugly.
[261:58.45]It would be that one weird solid color.
[262:02.37]It just looks like a cartoon house.
[262:08.98]This won't be much longer.
[262:11.66]See, right now, some of you guys are like, oh, we're just chilling out.
[262:13.96]No.
[262:14.20]Some of you guys got, like, dinner.
[262:17.92]Like, eating right now.
[262:18.78]So we got plenty of time.
[262:40.82]I had dinner already.
[262:42.82]What am I going to do for dinner?
[262:47.36]That's a really, really interesting question.
[262:58.77]It's got to be something I can eat fast.
[263:00.47]Because I plan on going for a lot longer than this.
[263:03.15]I need one more panel.
[263:06.29]Are you kidding me?
[263:11.45]Grilled cheese?
[263:12.01]That doesn't sound bad.
[263:24.65]Bingo.
[263:28.43]Still have to do over there.
[263:32.46]But I do have the scaffolding here I can bring over.
[263:36.32]Alright.
[263:36.74]Looks alright.
[263:39.45]What have we got?
[263:40.11]Two, I got two, how many sca- I just like rage bought all of these.
[263:50.21]Grilled cheese and tomato soup, that sounds pretty easy.
[263:52.75]Sounds pretty quick too.
[264:08.16]I'm not sure we have that here, though.
[264:13.08]Need to go to the grocery store.
[264:14.70]It's been a while.
[264:18.45]Pick up some essentials, like cheese and tomato soup.
[264:25.76]All essential things to have in your household.
[264:37.75]Got it.
[264:38.35]Alright, let's do this too.
[264:44.77]Can I reach from here?
[264:45.55]No, I can't.
[264:50.55]How do I do it on money?
[264:52.63]Oh yeah, that's right.
[264:53.61]I bought and sold this stupid Home Alone house for like $600,000.
[264:56.40]Alright, what do you got?
[265:02.10]What's the...
[265:03.47]What do you guys think is the fastest way to make $500,000?
[265:08.50]Legally.
[265:11.26]Legally.
[265:24.10]The lottery?
[265:25.96]I said fastest.
[265:28.37]You could play the lottery for like 50 years and not win.
[265:33.70]Like, what is a guaranteed way to make $500,000 in like a year?
[265:38.53]If anybody knew that, everybody would just do it.
[265:51.16]Play Fortnite.
[265:52.02]Be a Fortnite player?
[265:56.60]Is it?
[265:57.12]It's not that easy, is it?
[266:02.74]There's a lot of people that play Fortnite.
[266:04.30]A lot of them aren't like 500,000 dares.
[266:07.28]There's a lot of people that play that game.
[266:15.65]Get out of the way, I'm just gonna jump.
[266:25.42]Write in AI, like code in AI.
[266:41.93]work a $50,000 a year job.
[266:42.51]But 10 times like so to have 10 $50,000 a year jobs at the same time.
[266:46.81]Okay.
[267:08.03]Work a $500,000 a year job with an IQ thing.
[267:09.75]Win the Jerma Rumble 5,600 times.
[267:11.19]I don't do that many in a year though.
[267:17.15]Coming together.
[267:34.79]Okay, so you could work for a year, and get $50,000, go to the casino, and put it on red 10 times.
[267:45.00]No, double it up, so you get $100,000, and then put it on black, $200,000, put it on black, $400,000, put it on red, $800,000.
[267:49.52]And then you leave.
[267:50.68]You get your $400,000.
[267:51.06]Ask 500,000 people for $1.
[268:06.22]And lose everything.
[268:07.92]No, do not do that.
[268:09.40]That is very bad advice.
[268:15.67]Get good at Jeopardy.
[268:16.77]Now that's a good idea.
[268:19.45]That's thinking with your head.
[268:23.41]Get really good at a game show.
[268:26.77]And then go win the game show.
[268:45.47]Write a Star Wars movie.
[268:46.85]But you have to get hired to do the Star Wars movie.
[268:48.39]You don't have to get hired to... There's $500,000 right there.
[268:51.67]No, but seriously, that was 50 bucks.
[269:06.08]5,000 vids.
[269:14.43]From VoidSpace123.
[269:15.56]Thank you, VoidSpace.
[269:16.10]And VoidSpace says... Love you, man.
[269:25.82]Keep doing what you're doing.
[269:28.28]I'm gonna keep doing it.
[269:45.06]Thank you so much for the 50 fucking dollars and the incredibly kind message.
[269:50.23]Thank you, Void Space.
[269:54.45]I need more of these.
[269:55.41]50 bucks is a lot of money.
[270:01.25]It is to give somebody on the internet.
[270:11.61]Where am I?
[270:19.95]So, and if I can impact you positively, that's great.
[270:21.97]I'm very glad I do.
[270:24.37]I would hate to negatively impact somebody.
[270:27.61]So, I'm glad to hear that.
[270:38.39]Oh no.
[270:45.17]Why is this happening?
[270:46.89]Okay, I just have to squeeze it in.
[271:00.44]Almost done with the paneling.
[271:03.98]Oh, it's so close to not having to do it anymore.
[271:07.79]I'm so happy.
[271:09.73]Oh, that's it, right?
[271:14.95]Alright, now redo it.
[271:15.79]I don't like the color, Jeremy.
[271:18.61]Let's just make sure.
[271:19.15]Is this really not a bit?
[271:26.85]No.
[271:27.45]You thought this whole thing was a joke?
[271:36.58]Uh, no.
[271:48.06]Is it the Family Guy house?
[271:51.89]It's not the Family Guy.
[271:59.01]Let me look this up.
[272:02.12]It's not.
[272:02.66]Family Guy, the Family Guy house is white.
[272:07.64]It is.
[272:17.57]Roof is also the same.
[272:21.03]Should I make a red door?
[272:22.23]No, I don't want to have a Family Guy house.
[272:42.30]You can't even have a red door.
[272:50.49]There is no red door.
[272:51.60]There's a refrigerator.
[273:15.33]Fucking Family Guy house.
[273:16.89]Why?
[273:18.07]You can change the door color?
[273:20.21]You can?
[273:30.58]Internal door.
[273:33.74]Front door.
[273:34.22]You can't change the color.
[273:47.96]paint the door.
[273:48.84]You can paint the door?
[273:49.92]No you can't.
[273:55.84]You can't paint the
[274:27.64]Got him.
[274:28.12]Yeah, I mean... They can't paint the door.
[274:35.48]Alright.
[274:37.35]I can't believe it's a Family Guy house.
[274:39.27]And even the top is, like, green, isn't it?
[274:43.17]I think the top is this weird, off-green, kind of gray... I can't... I... I can't even look at the house now.
[274:57.53]I seriously can't look at it.
[275:11.28]It's alright.
[275:12.46]No, no mini-golf!
[275:13.46]I'm sticking through this.
[275:14.44]I don't care if I have the family g- Fuck.
[275:21.73]I hate this.
[275:23.61]No.
[275:30.73]Second floor.
[275:31.53]I know I'm going out there.
[275:32.93]I'm going out there to finish my Family Guy house.
[275:36.13]Fuck.
[275:41.47]Whatever.
[275:42.51]Oh, well.
[275:49.79]Oh, sorry.
[275:50.05]It's my other balcony.
[275:55.37]It's my other balcony I have on the other side.
[275:59.84]We have three balconies.
[276:14.29]Hey, Peter, do you remember the time that we built that house?
[276:18.17]Yeah, it's my house, Joe.
[276:38.02]And this is the whole episode.
[276:39.02]Hey Quagmire, can you pull the car out of the garage?
[276:59.35]Hey, okay, sure thing, Pip.
[277:01.21]I do that all the time.
[277:04.57]Oh, you're all about sex, aren't you, Quagmire?
[277:46.37]Dude, this is, like, kind of cringe.
[277:49.21]No, it wasn't.
[277:49.71]Shut up.
[277:50.01]What are you talking about?
[277:59.89]No, it wasn't.
[278:00.27]What are you talking about?
[278:01.95]Don't say that.
[278:02.43]What are you talking about?
[278:06.00]My Peter Griffin's, like, pretty good, I thought.
[278:07.36]That's what my friends told me.
[278:14.64]Alright, is everything done?
[278:24.25]I think that's it.
[278:38.78]I can't paint the window frames.
[278:39.94]It doesn't work.
[278:43.36]The garage... Should the garage be different?
[278:46.64]I don't think I want the garage to have these same panels.
[279:06.91]Maybe like a... What's wrong with the front door?
[279:15.27]Oh.
[279:18.34]It's kind of fucked up.
[279:22.70]Okay.
[279:41.95]Is that in there?
[279:49.86]That's fine.
[279:54.29]Play the Family Guy theme.
[279:55.55]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[279:56.45]Do you want me to do like this loud voice crack Peter Griffin laugh?
[280:02.57]I mean, I'll do that again.
[280:05.54]When you start to get like, a little rambunctious.
[280:12.74]Alright, I want something different out here.
[280:16.10]Add doors to the house.
[280:16.98]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[280:29.61]I feel bad for the people that I turn away.
[280:31.35]Stop writing the things that you're saying.
[280:34.49]That's not the problem.
[280:35.85]It has nothing to do with being tired.
[280:47.12]Oh, there is a doormat right here.
[280:48.36]Alright, I need some sliders.
[280:51.50]I need a few of them.
[281:05.11]That one... I might change this.
[281:19.55]Okay.
[281:28.82]What are you guys doing?
[281:30.06]Why are you doing that cringy thing in chat right now?
[281:33.45]There's something cringy going on in here.
[281:59.19]Alright, internal, let's do... I don't want to put the doors... I'll put some placeholder doors.
[282:06.57]I'll put some $246 placeholders.
[282:08.04]Because I don't know what the color and the paint and stuff is going to be in here.
[282:11.60]Does anybody have a clip of me doing that?
[282:18.94]I want to see what it sounds like.
[282:22.47]I'm going to mute the audio, though.
[282:23.47]It's just for me.
[282:24.59]I want to hear it.
[282:32.75]Make that the front door.
[282:33.63]No!
[282:42.89]Alright, that's fine.
[282:46.53]Place the fridge on the front lawn and it'll be your true Vegas house.
[282:53.16]Fridge on the front lawn?
[283:00.04]What does that mean?
[283:04.82]Nobody has a clip of that.
[283:07.98]No one saved that.
[283:11.48]How many people are here?
[283:14.76]There are 3652.
[283:16.32]There are 3600 fucking people here.
[283:18.79]No one fucking clipped it.
[283:20.53]They must have hated it.
[283:21.31]You guys must have hated that.
[283:23.09]Is this it?
[283:23.43]Okay, here's a clip of it.
[283:28.25]This clip has one view, and it's me.
[283:33.65]Somebody had to go back and clip this because it was so- they hated it so much!
[283:38.05]Hold on, I wanna- I'm mutin'.
[283:43.10]I wanna hear this.
[283:57.63]It's not that bad.
[284:03.92]Why did everybody hate that so much?
[284:06.54]What was wrong with that?
[284:14.57]I thought that was pretty good.
[284:33.96]Okay, I won't put you through that.
[284:40.04]I won't put you through that.
[284:55.61]Don't ever do that again.
[284:59.67]Alright, so let's go like this.
[285:03.19]Move office here?
[285:03.91]No.
[285:06.30]The internet here sucks.
[285:07.90]I have to move to my office.
[285:09.80]This is pissing me off though, seriously.
[285:11.62]How do I fix this?
[285:17.71]You know what I'm saying?
[285:18.49]Why is it like this?
[285:23.27]Why do I have Tetris pieces in my front lawn?
[285:25.87]This is...
[285:33.19]Recreate the Family Guy interior.
[285:35.25]That would be committing so hard to something that was never supposed to be that.
[285:41.98]First it was mini golf, now it's a one-to-one internal Family Guy house.
[285:48.98]No.
[285:57.25]That's gonna be worse noise of 2019, I already know it.
[286:03.11]I don't even need to do any more noises ever again.
[286:05.03]Alright, uh, I want... Let's get the grass rolled out here.
[286:17.38]Family golf.
[286:27.61]Um, what do I need?
[286:28.29]The turf.
[286:33.19]Alright, there's some turf here.
[286:43.39]Ugh, that looks like shit.
[286:45.30]I gotta go this way.
[286:49.18]I'm trying to write an essay.
[286:50.22]Can you stop streaming?
[286:51.56]Yeah.
[286:52.80]Thanks for coming out, everybody.
[286:53.56]There's somebody making an essay.
[286:55.58]I don't want to, like, fuck up this cool thing, so...
[287:03.06]I should be careful doing that because I wonder how many people, what like the percentage of people that just click off the stream when that slide comes up.
[287:10.65]It's probably pretty high.
[287:11.47]I'm just gonna buy it.
[287:25.74]Look, you know what?
[287:33.89]Okay.
[287:42.89]I actually kind of like this.
[287:45.81]Maybe I'll keep a couple stacks.
[287:53.09]Alright, let's go back here, get it lined up.
[287:57.27]It's a farm.
[287:58.90]Why did I do that?
[288:00.32]I did it because I was sick of going into the menu and buying them.
[288:03.96]So I'm going to just use these and not have to buy them.
[288:16.09]See?
[288:17.47]Right here.
[288:17.85]Done.
[288:18.25]Go.
[288:18.75]Roll.
[288:20.39]It doesn't matter.
[288:21.78]It could be uneven.
[288:23.70]I have a ton of them.
[288:30.96]Wait.
[288:34.68]This is the driveway.
[288:36.28]Hold on.
[288:36.64]Yeah.
[288:37.02]Fuck.
[288:37.88]Grass driveway.
[288:49.17]He's still on the lawn?
[288:50.55]No!
[288:50.89]Did you?
[288:51.21]Wait.
[288:51.55]Wait.
[288:51.95]Somebody just came in.
[288:52.49]There's a big reveal.
[288:53.17]Ready?
[288:54.50]You saw what it looked like before.
[288:55.34]Yeah.
[288:55.58]He's still on the lawn.
[288:56.28]Just wet.
[288:56.82]Not the lawn anymore.
[288:57.62]Ready?
[288:58.42]One.
[288:58.70]Two.
[288:58.88]Take a look now.
[289:04.20]See?
[289:11.18]Alright.
[289:16.55]So then from here... to here needs to be... a driveway.
[289:24.43]This is how you- No, God.
[289:26.15]No, why would you do it like this?
[289:27.63]This is too... This is a huge driveway.
[289:30.24]This is like a- The whole side yard is gonna be a driveway?
[289:35.51]The driveway hits the side of the house.
[289:48.06]This is too much driveway.
[289:49.44]This is more driveway than any yard.
[289:54.76]What I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to have the driveway come down here and then go to a single lane.
[290:03.63]But that's gonna look ugly.
[290:13.56]Hold on.
[290:16.44]Yeah, and I'm not gonna... Just... Hold on.
[290:17.82]Let's do the dog park.
[290:30.53]Get rid of some of these.
[290:37.35]Just curve it.
[290:41.62]Yeah, it doesn't have to be a garage.
[290:43.16]It could be a tool shed, but what do you do with your car?
[290:46.41]Park on the street?
[290:47.13]Oh, come on.
[290:54.33]Fuck you.
[290:57.43]Yes, but if I... No, I can make a garage.
[290:59.71]I can do it.
[291:02.57]If I have a two-car garage, why would I park my car on the street?
[291:15.61]Don't hit the tree.
[291:16.17]Don't hit the tree.
[291:16.67]Don't hit the tree.
[291:17.13]Don't hit the tree.
[291:17.57]Don't hit the tree.
[291:18.09]Don't hit the tree.
[291:18.73]Yes!
[291:19.31]Didn't hit the tree.
[291:25.68]Don't buy them.
[291:26.34]You don't need it.
[291:33.64]Park in your neighbor's garage.
[291:35.76]I don't think they would be too happy about that.
[291:50.14]Ay, they will.
[291:52.02]Ay, they will.
[292:01.11]Oh, I'm just making these patches.
[292:04.81]I got an idea for back here, a little barbecue section.
[292:08.05]Out and around.
[292:09.77]More garden this way.
[292:11.93]Of, like, millions of dollars worth of shit back here, too.
[292:15.02]Because it's protected by the fence.
[292:18.50]And then a little play area back here.
[292:20.48]It's going to be insane.
[292:29.21]Let's just get this over with.
[292:30.39]Let me see what this would look like.
[292:51.28]I need, like, gravel.
[292:52.82]Is there, like, driveway?
[292:54.28]Gravel.
[292:58.01]No, you don't, like, drive on crushed stone.
[293:00.09]Uh, stone?
[293:01.75]Like, this?
[293:07.27]Like, pavement?
[293:10.20]Is it just a pavement?
[293:10.76]Pavement?
[293:18.73]ass concrete yeah but like like pavement they don't have like pavement it's like one of these I don't like this the designs on here though I just wanted to be plain
[293:51.40]Hmm, that's not bad.
[293:54.66]The pebbles.
[293:59.62]Ooh, that looks good.
[294:05.98]I don't hate this.
[294:15.67]Why not search for concrete?
[294:16.69]I already did.
[294:20.65]It's like these weird... I don't like this.
[294:25.01]I don't like the... I want it to be just plain.
[294:44.22]There's no asphalt either.
[294:48.12]Mmm No, this is not bad, but it's too small That's not bad composite board though, no I'll just break Cobblestone circles
[295:16.36]I'll just go with what I was doing before, the pebble one.
[295:24.70]I like it.
[295:25.16]How big is it?
[295:25.89]50 by... How big is that?
[295:28.45]It's so tiny.
[295:37.49]Gold driveway.
[295:38.89]What about cat's head?
[295:41.51]Gold?
[295:44.33]This might be, like, kind of cool looking.
[296:05.60]Is it spot surface?
[296:15.69]Spot surface?
[296:20.22]A sports surface.
[296:24.46]There it is.
[296:25.08]Yeah, there it is.
[296:30.93]This is fucking ugly though.
[296:32.27]I actually like that better.
[296:34.99]I like the weird like rich crystal one It's called cats
[297:05.47]It's as big as it can get?
[297:06.43]This is fucked up.
[297:18.29]The first one was correct.
[297:19.13]Okay, buy many.
[297:21.26]Here we go.
[297:32.72]This is gonna take a hundred years.
[297:37.71]I have to match up the pieces.
[297:38.95]Sand?
[298:08.89]A sand driveway.
[298:20.92]It's like the house fell over and planted its forehead into the ground.
[298:31.13]Bark?
[298:34.05]Single color gravel.
[298:34.99]I want darker than this, though.
[298:36.05]I want red.
[298:39.90]wood cuttings whiz like black wood chippings it's just dark this is as dark as I can get it there we go this is perfect perfect
[299:23.95]Hello?
[299:31.00]Size is small enough.
[299:34.36]We want sand.
[299:35.38]We want sand.
[299:36.28]No.
[299:36.82]No, you can't always get what you want.
[299:41.96]But what about what I want?
[299:44.76]What do I want?
[299:51.03]Sometimes it's what I want.
[300:14.25]This driveway's fucking huge.
[300:37.76]Tear down the garage?
[300:38.74]I don't think I can.
[300:40.10]It's a structure that can't be moved, I don't think.
[300:47.13]Move it closer to the road.
[300:52.85]Tear it down and make it closer.
[300:54.43]This is as big as I can get it.
[301:03.18]Alright, so I'm gonna change this in a minute here.
[301:10.42]This is straight over here.
[301:14.22]So the car, they have to have enough for the car to turn in here.
[301:18.16]Car comes in.
[301:45.37]straight through yeah that's that's fine and then yeah it turns into the two-car garage right here because I this is this is too close this is right here it's too close to the edge of the house
[302:16.76]Let me see what happens if I do this.
[302:35.47]Come on, get it.
[302:40.71]We're keeping our sand!
[302:43.47]Where are you gonna get the sand?
[302:46.01]Where you get this magic sand?
[302:56.61]So then here, I'm gonna go like this.
[303:00.63]This can be changed.
[303:32.35]It's hard to look there's not specific tools I can paint well with I can't like brush it like this I have to put it all the way over here and see They're not the best tools It's not gonna be exact
[304:05.21]And plus, we're gonna put stuff on the sides anyways.
[304:09.97]Now, look, look.
[304:10.73]Alright, I'm gonna show this to you one more time.
[304:13.11]I can't start deleting.
[304:14.97]Look!
[304:15.47]Look at!
[304:16.77]I can only start deleting when it's there!
[304:20.30]And if I click right now, you know what's gonna happen!
[304:24.24]Even when it's tiny.
[304:25.04]Look!
[304:26.04]I... Mm-mm!
[304:27.76]Mm-mm!
[304:28.48]Mm-mm!
[304:29.20]Mm-mm!
[304:56.60]I'm just covering this up with fucking bushes.
[305:42.37]There we go.
[305:44.79]Flatliner raid coming in.
[305:46.33]I have to fix this over here, though.
[305:52.72]Alright, let's put some grass down.
[306:01.23]It's gonna be like a bush here.
[306:02.35]Like a little fence or something.
[306:10.32]Alright.
[306:11.76]Time for grass.
[306:13.76]Are you looking?
[306:14.86]Here it comes.
[306:20.48]This actually is going to suck.
[306:25.92]I should have done this first.
[306:27.32]This is going to be horrible.
[306:36.73]I can't tell.
[306:37.13]Is that right?
[306:38.63]To run on the edge?
[306:43.14]God damn it.
[306:44.08]Why can't I just paint the grass?
[306:49.36]Why can't I just have a grass tool?
[306:53.92]Why do I have to roll it out in a straight line?
[306:55.71]That's uneven.
[307:19.74]Get it.
[307:20.58]Get it.
[307:23.57]I did it.
[307:24.47]Thank god.
[307:27.07]Oh, my goodness.
[307:29.77]Stop, stop.
[307:30.53]No, I did it.
[307:30.93]I got it.
[307:31.23]Good.
[307:31.41]That's good.
[307:31.81]What are you talking about?
[307:32.35]Stop.
[307:32.57]I got it.
[307:35.79]Crisis has been averted.
[307:36.75]Don't worry, guys.
[307:38.91]Everything's just fine.
[307:53.36]I can't wait to do everything and then look back at just how amazing it was.
[307:58.32]I can't wait to look back at some of the real highlights of this stream.
[308:02.13]You know, disposing of all the stuff, putting up the plants, asking for you guys, what do you think?
[308:10.57]Doing probably the best Peter Griffin I think I've ever done in my life.
[308:14.63]There's been some pretty good highlights for me here.
[308:35.14]He's gonna do one more, one more, one more, one more.
[308:37.58]It's too addicting.
[308:38.20]I'm just gonna keep rolling.
[308:46.90]Oh, Jesus.
[308:50.28]Uh, Dr. Lownote just came in with 10 community subs.
[308:53.06]Thank you, Dr. Lownote.
[308:56.43]That's a lot of subs.
[308:59.99]Thank you for the huge amount of community subs, Dr. Lownote!
[309:06.86]I, don't worry guys, I will, I will satiate your sand appetite.
[309:13.06]Because there's gonna be a big sand playpen over here on the, to the left.
[309:19.52]You guys are making flat lines?
[309:26.58]That's so stupid.
[309:28.32]Let's go straight up.
[309:37.84]A big litter box?
[309:39.78]No, it's gonna be like a little sand castle thing.
[309:46.12]Is there any dirt back here?
[309:58.80]Did I just line that up perfectly first try?
[310:00.38]Tell me I did.
[310:02.82]Oh, it was so close.
[310:07.06]I love how I just said first try.
[310:08.50]It's actually like 400th try.
[310:09.84]Just as far as I can get it to here.
[310:26.63]Let's try... I'm going to try to get this little edge.
[310:30.83]It's going to be rough.
[310:31.57]Let's see if I can do it.
[310:42.12]Got it.
[310:47.12]Dude, what's with the Z-fighting going on in the back?
[310:49.28]I know, that's what I was saying earlier.
[310:54.22]So that's Z-fighting right there, right?
[310:56.02]That's what you guys are talking about?
[311:01.44]He's wasting money.
[311:02.46]I have $374,000.
[311:06.77]I got plenty.
[311:08.87]I'm gonna sell this house for like a million dollars.
[311:11.32]So don't worry, I'll be fine.
[311:13.28]This is gonna be really, really horrible though.
[311:15.94]Oh, this sucks.
[311:20.62]How am I gonna take care of this?
[311:24.32]What's the reliable way to do this?
[311:25.86]It's alright.
[311:39.26]You had 500k before the Jenga debacle.
[311:44.07]Yeah, I'll get it all back.
[311:46.89]This house is going to be worth a lot of money.
[312:03.52]Get in there and clean that up.
[312:04.54]Let's go with a small one.
[312:07.59]Not just a regular one, right?
[312:08.93]So I can just run on the edge here.
[312:11.23]How am I going to do this?
[312:15.81]I'm going to have to start like here.
[312:18.29]I'm just going to have to add gravel.
[312:27.12]That's two.
[312:29.08]Mm-mm.
[312:30.43]No, just gonna add gravel.
[312:31.77]I got enough grass here where I can just do it from here.
[312:34.77]And it'll be fine.
[312:36.35]And then I'll just cover it with gravel.
[312:46.70]When are we gonna do the swamp?
[312:48.12]Uh, swamp's gonna be on the other side.
[312:51.80]Wait, what's swamp?
[312:52.44]What are you talking about?
[312:55.34]I'm thinking about the swamp.
[313:00.42]What are we doing?
[313:11.77]I guess we're doing a swamp.
[313:17.05]By swamp, they meant circus.
[313:18.19]I still have to go... Remember we tried that yesterday?
[313:24.81]putting the little wood chips and stuff, and it doesn't work, because this is its own hitbox.
[313:29.39]Its own collision.
[313:30.05]I have to put a bush in front of it or something.
[313:33.72]Alright, last one.
[313:34.48]This should do it.
[313:35.72]Let's get a regular one.
[313:40.92]And I can just... I actually can use this to make its own line.
[313:44.87]I'm gonna kind of encroach here, and it's... No, I can't.
[313:48.45]I can't.
[313:51.15]I'll just do it with the gravel.
[313:52.95]It'll be fine.
[314:01.35]I'll clean it up, don't worry.
[314:09.29]Oof, perfect.
[314:10.61]Exactly what I was looking for.
[314:12.29]So I'll get the square, and I will just square it up, and then move down, and square it up, and then move down.
[314:18.46]Looks pretty good.
[314:23.60]What color was this?
[314:24.22]It was just a dark one, right?
[314:32.54]crushed stone no no what is it gravel two this one tiny little pebble that doesn't look that's a false advertising I need square as well hey chat is this your precious sand
[315:02.02]What a shame it is if somebody were to cover this all up.
[315:04.96]Hmm.
[315:32.07]No.
[315:34.09]Not very much left.
[315:38.13]Unfortunately.
[315:38.79]Ah!
[316:25.17]This music is really not making this as sad as I want it to be.
[316:44.66]He's just playing with us now, he's toying with us now, he's toying with us!
[316:55.49]This is already a sharp edge.
[316:56.55]What are you doing?
[316:57.99]It's okay.
[317:31.38]There's going to be a bush anyways.
[317:33.96]So it's okay.
[317:34.46]Is this the sand here?
[317:40.56]I can't have that.
[317:41.18]Alright, there's going to be some bushes.
[317:47.85]Finally.
[317:48.29]No, we're not.
[317:49.13]God, we're not done at all.
[317:50.25]I need more turf.
[317:56.03]A small one to get over here.
[318:02.98]Did I get it right?
[318:11.51]No.
[318:12.85]It's okay.
[318:19.66]I can clean it up.
[318:30.51]It's fine.
[318:31.93]Give me the... Give me a bigger one.
[318:33.81]Just the regular one will be good here.
[318:36.53]Right there.
[318:41.33]Plus, I will have something on the... Maybe a couple... What?
[318:44.11]Maybe those kind of tall hedges?
[318:45.53]What do you guys think?
[318:48.05]You guys pick this time.
[318:49.33]Not me.
[318:57.78]Sand?
[318:58.96]Around the edges?
[319:04.18]That could work.
[319:04.66]It's not ruined yet.
[319:24.70]Not yet, not yet.
[319:38.75]Because I'm going to, just like I did over here, we're going to fix this.
[319:45.33]It's not ruined.
[319:53.56]I want to know, like, when you do the smiley face, are you doing that in real life, too?
[319:58.71]I bet you aren't.
[320:12.05]I bet you're not.
[320:12.55]I bet you're just sitting there tightening it.
[320:14.90]You don't actually mean it.
[320:45.36]I'm just gonna put some- there'll be bushes here.
[320:47.44]I'm not gonna spend like an eternity trying to get this perfect.
[320:50.50]We're gonna have bushes, hedges... There's no reason to do this.
[320:56.35]Not at all.
[321:01.11]Alright.
[321:02.61]Hey!
[321:03.39]You guys still awake?
[321:05.07]You guys still with me here?
[321:07.65]We have what is the beginning of a driveway.
[321:19.15]Now, um, tree?
[321:28.68]I need, like, kind of like these things.
[321:34.48]Those tall... Every, maybe, like, right next to each other?
[321:38.64]I could go all out and just line up with these.
[321:43.56]Or with these.
[321:44.74]What do you guys think?
[321:48.99]Don't worry.
[321:49.57]The carrots will go to the circus.
[321:50.61]Don't worry.
[321:50.97]I know everyone's going to freak out when they see that.
[321:54.13]I'm thinking a line of these.
[321:58.25]Right next to each other.
[322:01.23]Or these ones.
[322:10.68]These ones here?
[322:12.44]Make them Flamin' Hot Cheeto.
[322:14.10]Flavored.
[322:14.60]What do you think?
[322:20.01]Or, I don't think it should be green.
[322:26.83]Regular Cheetos or Flamin' Hot Cheetos?
[322:33.81]You need to combine these to heal.
[322:38.77]God.
[322:40.29]Flamin' Hot Cheetos?
[322:46.11]Let's see, let's take a look.
[322:52.46]And I'm talking back to back here.
[322:54.96]All the way down.
[322:56.80]Now that'd be kind of like Monarch, right?
[322:59.81]That'd be royalty.
[323:00.61]Too royalty.
[323:01.49]Too much royalty.
[323:04.45]Uh, no.
[323:04.91]I don't like it.
[323:05.33]I don't like that either.
[323:20.32]That's gonna be bigger.
[323:23.08]Maybe these?
[323:23.60]Oh, Jesus, these are fucking huge.
[323:33.07]Okay, does anybody feel like these are too big?
[323:34.69]Is that I got, like, a weird scale here?
[323:36.23]They're that big?
[323:44.36]One of these?
[323:51.45]I don't know.
[323:53.25]I don't mind this.
[323:56.59]Although it's kind of big and annoying.
[324:00.05]This might be too annoying.
[324:01.67]Maybe.
[324:03.81]There are no cactuses, unfortunately.
[324:09.46]In one of these.
[324:09.96]Let's see.
[324:11.08]That's a little less insane.
[324:12.46]I got money, so let's just play with it.
[324:16.64]Ready?
[324:16.88]I need to be close enough to be on the...
[324:30.33]Where's that one?
[324:44.72]It's not a Christmas tree runway.
[324:46.66]It's... There's gonna be other stuff in between.
[325:15.87]Two more.
[325:27.61]Where's the reindeer?
[325:31.05]Stop!
[325:31.53]S-shut up!
[325:33.28]Stop it!
[325:35.48]Hey, leave me alone!
[325:50.02]Oh man, oh man.
[325:53.02]Look, see?
[325:53.84]It looks fine.
[326:03.76]That looks okay.
[326:04.46]That looks fine.
[326:05.08]There's nothing wrong with that.
[326:06.34]And I'm going to put some flowers in the middle.
[326:12.75]I'll put a row of red flowers down here.
[326:23.42]Or orange.
[326:26.96]I'm doing it.
[326:31.34]You know, I don't care what the haters say.
[326:33.72]Well, the haters are right this time.
[326:59.93]The five people who are on the left have all fallen asleep and haven't commented in over an hour.
[327:06.21]Is that true?
[327:17.50]Just stick with me, guys.
[327:18.62]Stick with me.
[327:19.16]I've got a... I've got a plan.
[327:22.25]This is just the... We're going to finish up the back here.
[327:24.83]I don't need anything on this side.
[327:26.95]In fact, I am going to put this one here.
[327:31.42]No, I'm not.
[327:33.82]Put it back.
[327:34.18]I haven't even planted this.
[327:48.03]Where was it?
[327:50.73]It's like right there.
[327:51.24]Okay, that's good.
[327:52.28]I haven't even planted this!
[327:54.90]That looks good.
[328:21.44]What's wrong with having all these trees?
[328:32.79]You're losing the casual audience.
[328:34.63]Should I spray myself with the hose?
[328:47.02]I actually kind of like this.
[328:48.86]You can call me a boomer if you want.
[328:50.18]It looks fine.
[328:50.98]It looks good.
[328:52.54]I think it looks alright.
[328:58.13]I really do.
[329:00.81]And we're going to do a couple of huge ones over here.
[329:03.69]No, we're not.
[329:04.09]No, we don't need anything over there.
[329:05.04]No, no.
[329:06.04]Watch this.
[329:16.87]ooh ladies and gentlemen these look like they're too tall they're too tall they gotta be shorter a little bit just by like not very very much here we go
[329:47.41]There we go.
[329:47.95]Uh-huh.
[329:50.29]There it is.
[329:50.83]Okay, if they were symmetrical...
[330:53.83]clown garden.
[331:03.00]It's not a clown.
[331:08.82]This is not a clown garden.
[331:11.76]This is a normal garden with fun things
[331:28.08]Still a clown.
[331:37.05]And then back here is going to be a couple of other things.
[331:41.20]It's not a clown garden.
[331:42.44]Hey, that's a pretty nice clown garden.
[331:50.22]Back to orange.
[331:56.11]I just got here.
[331:56.63]Why is he making a clown garden?
[332:18.53]I think it looks pretty.
[332:19.35]And then we're gonna do yellow.
[332:41.10]It's five.
[332:44.11]Five, and then bingo.
[333:08.29]This one had to be six because it was a little longer.
[333:10.93]That looks kind of nice.
[333:11.91]And then I'm going to get... Watch this.
[333:18.92]A cinnamon apple tree.
[333:21.24]Apple trees down here.
[333:50.69]Get him in the middle.
[333:53.96]Those are clown noses.
[333:55.38]Oh, fuck.
[334:08.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[334:13.95]I'm flatlining.
[334:15.31]Please switch to the pre-recorded track.
[334:17.38]This is no pre- I told you this was gonna be all night.
[334:21.16]I give you fair warning.
[334:22.87]I warned you like four hours ago that we were going to go all night and I was going to make an entire fucking done house.
[334:32.59]It's going to be unbelievable.
[334:34.45]It's going to be, your jaw is going to hit the ground.
[334:40.73]Dude, I got beers to go.
[334:41.82]There you go.
[334:42.88]What time is it?
[334:43.42]It's like 9 o'clock Pacific.
[334:45.66]Oh, it is midnight.
[334:46.52]Whatever, all night.
[334:47.86]What is it, Friday?
[334:48.54]What are you doing tomorrow?
[334:50.73]It's Friday night!
[334:52.95]What do you got going on tomorrow?
[334:54.55]It's the weekend!
[335:01.47]I think that looks cool.
[335:13.26]Yes, sure, you could tell me that this looks like
[335:17.94]Baby's first Unity game.
[335:19.78]I... Okay, I would... I might laugh at that.
[335:27.48]I would chuckle at that for a second.
[335:31.42]Did you see what it looked like before?
[335:32.51]Okay, and now... When are we gonna put the red fri- What?
[335:44.79]Wait, what's the deal with the red fridge?
[335:52.09]I need something on the other side.
[335:53.27]What should go on the other side here on the right?
[335:56.65]Like a handrail?
[335:57.91]A railing?
[335:58.39]Is it gonna handrail?
[336:06.64]This is missing something.
[336:12.76]A flower bed?
[336:14.14]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[336:16.54]A red fridge?
[336:17.34]I'm not putting a red fridge.
[336:56.33]Why would anybody have this many plants?
[337:00.01]Alright, let's be honest.
[337:01.93]Why would somebody have this many plants?
[337:06.57]Dude, this is a full-time job for like 10 people to maintain all this.
[337:13.28]To take care of all this stuff, you would need fucking like 12 employees.
[337:16.16]Alright, so let's put some flowers in here.
[337:20.18]Flowers.
[337:21.24]Nice ones.
[337:25.89]Strawberry flower.
[337:29.41]Large roses.
[337:31.32]Here we go.
[337:32.48]Here we go.
[337:33.18]Here we go!
[338:04.77]Bye.
[338:57.33]Here we go.
[339:08.10]This is so much time and energy.
[339:11.59]How would you even know if one of these died?
[339:13.69]Would you even know?
[339:14.39]I feel like you wouldn't know if one of these died.
[339:27.17]I already blew it, though.
[339:27.93]Okay, does it move the whole thing?
[339:30.77]Thank God it does.
[339:31.63]Okay.
[339:50.93]Need more gravel here.
[339:58.26]Look at that.
[339:59.78]Better.
[340:00.32]Looks better.
[340:00.72]I need one more here, I think.
[340:02.68]Move this one back.
[340:04.10]Move this one forward.
[340:21.63]Gravel.
[340:21.87]Is this trash in the garage?
[340:24.77]No, it's not.
[340:28.46]Get some gravel.
[340:44.09]Go right to the edge on this one.
[340:54.04]I wonder if I should just put that around here.
[340:56.76]Yeah.
[341:01.29]Hello, can I get an estimate of getting my lawn done?
[341:03.09]I saw your ad in the paper.
[341:06.72]$500,000 in one payment.
[341:16.84]Something's missing here, though.
[341:19.48]I got my trees.
[341:20.94]Maybe something else right there.
[341:32.50]A big boulder.
[341:33.94]Or a fountain.
[341:34.40]A fountain.
[341:34.80]I like a fountain better than a boulder.
[341:38.90]Which one?
[341:41.94]This one looks kind of good.
[341:46.35]Try the blue.
[341:48.61]What if we did two fountains?
[341:58.14]Fountain, fountain, and fountain in the middle.
[342:02.94]Wait a minute, hold on.
[342:09.58]No, that... no.
[342:36.08]Nah, don't work.
[342:36.70]This might go over here.
[342:38.14]I'm gonna sneeze.
[342:38.58]I'm just bored of you.
[342:39.70]Maybe just one of the big ones.
[342:58.03]Like one of these.
[343:00.83]Stone?
[343:01.35]Marine?
[343:03.83]Like that.
[343:04.55]Let's see this.
[343:09.31]That's not terrible.
[343:11.75]Turn it, though.
[343:12.23]Make it the same color as the grass.
[343:22.24]I don't think I can even do that.
[343:30.68]You guys want me to change off of Sandy.
[343:32.28]Is that what you guys are saying?
[343:40.00]Alright, something right here.
[343:41.66]I'm thinking something cool.
[343:44.18]A little decoration.
[343:48.16]Maybe a big tulip lamp?
[343:51.72]Birdbath?
[343:52.50]Rabbit cage.
[344:01.60]A big rock?
[344:03.66]Under the pool?
[344:05.42]Yeah.
[344:19.59]Move it over a little bit.
[344:22.05]You're gonna have so many mosquitoes.
[344:53.27]So... extra.
[345:29.33]I figured out what I'm doing.
[345:32.06]I am desperately trying to have the coolest house on the block for their Christmas decorations.
[345:40.26]I'm trying to make one of those houses that you drive by during Christmas.
[345:44.87]And you go, holy fuck, that person's insane.
[345:57.73]I have to have the most ridiculous house on the whole lot.
[346:02.13]Except all year round.
[346:03.60]Yeah, that's it.
[346:05.62]This is too- okay, I'm getting way too super extra extra.
[346:08.60]Let's do something over here too.
[346:11.04]This house is gonna be worth a fucking trillion dollars.
[346:13.52]Bird feeder.
[346:14.34]Perfect.
[346:15.88]Make it, uh, ash.
[346:20.37]Right near the tree.
[346:21.59]Right here, right here.
[346:26.56]No, no, no, no, that goes over here.
[346:31.08]That goes in the backyard.
[346:35.23]So you can look out the window from your fucking weird dungeon room and see the birds eating.
[346:39.39]Alright, and then, uh, a, uh, a gazebo.
[347:16.47]Never mind.
[347:16.99]Won't fit.
[347:26.44]Can I have a bridge go over the driveway?
[347:30.04]How do I...
[347:54.54]No, this is too much here.
[347:58.06]Garden.
[348:00.81]Fences.
[348:01.59]No.
[348:02.41]Architecture.
[348:02.95]No.
[348:04.23]Recreation.
[348:04.81]Yeah, something fun.
[348:07.49]No, that goes in the back.
[348:08.47]A hammock.
[348:18.16]Right here.
[348:23.13]Right in between the apples.
[348:36.10]You can come out here and enjoy the pond, grab an apple, you can just like bite into it.
[348:41.41]I'm gonna turn this actually.
[348:50.93]Just a little bit.
[348:51.95]Pull it forward.
[348:54.53]This is fucking insane.
[349:04.70]Nice.
[349:07.50]Ruined.
[349:08.54]Change it back?
[349:09.04]Alright.
[349:16.65]This is coming together.
[349:17.43]This looks really interesting.
[349:19.96]By the way, interesting is a fake compliment when something looks terrible.
[349:23.26]But you don't say it looks bad.
[349:26.26]It looks interesting.
[349:27.95]Which means bad.
[349:28.77]Alright.
[349:36.31]I think we're done with the driveway portion.
[349:38.25]We'll get over here later when we leave the backyard.
[349:40.27]I want something secret back here that only I know about and nobody else does.
[349:48.56]Yeah, I want a sacred grill back here.
[349:50.52]No, I want a tire swing back here.
[349:53.37]I want a fire pit back here.
[349:54.85]No, that goes in the backyard.
[349:55.75]I want a... ...a sacred grill.
[350:00.76]None of that makes no sense.
[350:25.85]Remember I told you I needed something here?
[350:26.89]This is what we needed.
[350:41.19]This is what we needed.
[350:59.30]I need to move this.
[351:00.80]How do I move this?
[351:10.69]Too much!
[351:11.77]Is it too much?
[351:12.45]I feel like, um... I feel like this is okay, though.
[351:19.19]Does this need to go?
[351:19.75]No, I think that's fine.
[351:22.44]You're gonna go up a ski lift.
[351:34.31]But a fire pit needs to go here.
[351:36.17]No, that needs to go in the backyard.
[351:37.97]Can I put this here?
[351:38.83]There has to be like a table.
[351:42.15]Give me a table.
[351:47.32]Table.
[351:52.22]Something fun.
[351:53.04]Something cool.
[351:53.98]Something swanky.
[351:55.60]Something chic.
[351:58.14]There we go.
[352:09.06]It's turning into a grandma house.
[352:10.44]It's turning into an old lady house.
[352:13.08]Real quick.
[352:18.91]This is really quickly... I need something over here, though.
[352:24.65]It looks alright.
[352:27.09]I like that color.
[352:30.43]I want something over here.
[352:33.36]Edible plants.
[352:36.72]Pumpkin?
[352:37.10]No, that makes no sense.
[352:42.86]What can go right?
[352:44.69]Nothing.
[352:45.87]Nothing needs to be right here.
[352:47.45]Until we get over here.
[352:48.83]And then we got... Bang!
[352:50.01]Here's your walkway.
[352:55.51]Walkway.
[353:00.13]Let me get this going here.
[353:01.07]I need, like, a good pool.
[353:12.26]And a pool fit back here?
[353:15.48]Why is the front yard way bigger than the backyard?
[353:31.24]Alright, here we go.
[353:32.70]I want a sick patio.
[353:35.44]Barbecue.
[353:36.04]Bring your friends over.
[353:37.74]Chill.
[353:38.08]Have a couple of drinks.
[353:40.07]Talk shit.
[353:41.71]About the game.
[353:42.81]The last game that came out.
[353:45.95]Alright, here we go.
[353:47.55]I'm gonna go with... Out these doors.
[353:51.41]This is like the... This is like the cigarette den, right?
[353:53.51]You go out here and you have like a cigarette.
[353:55.23]This is where the people that go have cigarettes.
[353:56.83]This is not like a... Who cares?
[353:58.15]This is stupid.
[353:59.33]Out here though... This is the whole thing.
[354:07.00]So I'm going to go with one of those... What are they called?
[354:18.51]What's the thing that... Not a gazebo.
[354:32.50]What's it called?
[354:45.15]Yeah, there, okay, yeah, there it is.
[354:47.15]Perp, what, a gondola?
[354:49.05]Isn't it, what is a gondola?
[354:58.72]A gondola is a boat?
[355:00.12]Alright, I'm gonna say we want something a little lighter.
[355:06.81]Maybe, maybe white.
[355:12.33]Hmm, I like this.
[355:23.31]Bank.
[355:23.95]Toofen?
[355:25.03]Shit.
[355:51.23]That actually is ruined.
[355:52.97]Yes, I know.
[355:53.73]I know.
[355:54.01]I got it.
[355:54.37]I got it.
[355:54.69]I fixed it.
[355:57.09]I got it.
[355:57.41]Everything's fixed.
[356:13.70]Come on.
[356:17.90]Come on.
[356:33.80]Killing me here.
[356:54.73]Ah!
[356:55.17]I... No!
[356:58.89]No.
[356:59.37]God damn it.
[357:07.71]It's gotta be closer to the house somehow.
[357:10.16]Right there?
[357:13.62]Got it.
[357:14.10]Finally.
[357:14.80]Holy shit, that took too long.
[357:18.10]Alright, now... Let's go ahead and let's make a little bit of a... I think I'm gonna do a little bit of mulch.
[357:27.52]I'm gonna do some mulch that goes around here.
[357:30.60]And like stops here.
[357:35.24]Let's mulch it.
[357:42.77]I need some walkway.
[357:46.09]I need some paving stone here.
[357:57.76]That's an interesting design.
[358:00.18]Paving stone, uh, symphonia.
[358:11.57]Which one?
[358:24.74]I like this one.
[358:28.38]Use the stepping stones.
[358:35.66]I will.
[358:41.13]We're going to do these sandy.
[358:46.02]I need something out here first though.
[358:50.67]Stepping stones is later.
[358:59.29]Perfect opportunity for our cat.
[359:29.14]Is it not flush?
[359:30.78]Can it even be flush with the house?
[360:08.75]Saved it.
[360:10.15]It's too big!
[360:14.03]What the hell?
[360:14.83]Why?
[360:22.40]I can't do anything about that.
[360:23.38]That's gonna have to be there.
[360:26.24]I can use the small pieces later.
[360:38.25]It's not matching up.
[361:01.85]I need the smaller one to do the front here.
[361:10.94]What color do I want?
[361:11.90]This one... This, and then this, right?
[361:16.52]Right here?
[361:18.38]Beige and dark gray?
[361:19.36]I thought that should do it.
[361:37.81]In fact, I'm going to make sure it doesn't.
[361:42.13]I'm gonna come out again.
[361:42.81]No, get rid of this door.
[362:00.70]Uh, hello?
[362:02.00]My... Hello?
[362:07.24]What was that happening for?
[362:17.23]Starting.
[362:18.49]I got it.
[362:18.91]Okay, now... I should be able to do the bigger piece.
[362:34.47]Beige and dark gray.
[362:37.09]Now, will this line up correctly in here?
[362:44.86]I'm gonna have to just sacrifice.
[362:49.66]Yeah, it does.
[362:50.20]We're good.
[362:53.10]That's alright.
[362:53.64]I can fa- I can work with this later.
[362:55.14]Running the edge here.
[362:57.64]Come on.
[363:03.80]Damn it.
[363:09.80]Come on!
[363:10.48]Why?
[363:12.18]Give me a break!
[363:17.82]I have to do little pieces.
[363:21.02]This thing's in the way.
[363:27.58]It took so long to get this flush, too.
[363:29.21]Alright, it should work now.
[363:37.55]We should be good to go.
[363:39.31]There we go, okay.
[363:40.31]Are we lined up?
[363:40.97]Do we have good... What's the best way?
[363:45.40]What do you think?
[363:46.16]Right there.
[363:49.14]Thank god, finally.
[363:58.70]I can use the little piece and I can go in the middle here, I think.
[364:02.28]I hope so.
[364:40.49]No, it's not gonna work.
[364:49.56]Uh, I could just fill this with, like, rocks.
[364:53.70]I'm just gonna gravel this up.
[364:55.02]We're gonna do two-tone gravel, gravel, all the way out.
[364:58.46]Here we go.
[364:59.20]We can do it with, like, sand or gravel.
[365:00.61]We'll do it.
[365:01.29]We'll be fine.
[365:01.73]Now I can just build this out.
[365:19.73]Actually, it might look kind of good.
[365:22.86]It's not going to look bad, that's for sure.
[365:24.18]It's going to look... You know what I'm saying.
[365:27.08]It might look pretty good.
[365:33.46]Come out.
[365:36.76]I wonder if... Should we do it like that?
[365:41.91]Just have the middle there have a little bit... Maybe put something in there?
[365:49.24]I'm gonna go across here.
[365:50.04]See what this looks like.
[366:02.07]This is kind of fucked up looking.
[366:15.88]That's not gonna work.
[366:18.14]Gotta go closer.
[366:21.96]I'm not sure I can.
[366:22.64]Can I even go closer with this one?
[366:26.81]I don't think I can.
[366:27.71]Oh well.
[366:33.96]I tried.
[366:34.42]I failed.
[366:53.33]This can build out here.
[366:55.01]I think I probably can just do this now.
[366:56.65]Let me see.
[367:10.57]Is it gonna work?
[367:11.33]What do you guys think?
[367:14.99]Thank god.
[367:16.89]Thank god it worked.
[367:21.72]Now we just have to do the skinny one down here.
[367:26.03]He genuinely loves this game.
[367:27.49]I think it's fun.
[367:28.43]I mean, all jokes aside, I think it's fun.
[367:41.70]It's not going to take it to the edge, is it?
[367:45.74]Is there another one that's as big as this?
[367:47.64]I don't think there is.
[367:55.18]We're just gonna have to deal with it.
[368:00.18]Plot, there's gonna be like a, there'll be a grill over here or something.
[368:02.96]You won't even know.
[368:19.37]Yeah, you won't even know.
[368:20.05]There's like, there'll be a fucking grill right here.
[368:23.17]We'll cap this up with some stone.
[368:29.46]Let's see.
[368:30.57]Stone, sand, gravel.
[368:33.85]What do we got?
[368:39.75]What do you guys think?
[368:43.11]Wood cuttings?
[368:45.37]Do sand?
[368:45.77]Let's see what it looks like.
[369:06.74]Huh.
[369:11.75]Looks a little weird.
[369:15.51]But not horrible.
[369:19.76]Let's put the gondolas back.
[369:37.95]Colors go well.
[369:38.65]Yeah, they do.
[369:39.23]They actually really do.
[369:44.80]Put a nice stream of water in the middle.
[369:46.92]Now you're talking.
[369:49.60]Now you're talking.
[369:50.46]That sounds pretty great.
[369:57.63]I almost feel like... No.
[370:00.23]No, never mind.
[370:11.66]It's not... It's not the same size.
[370:15.72]I can't build it out anymore, can I?
[370:19.41]Because essentially I would need one of these on each.
[370:23.41]Let me see.
[370:26.27]Hold on, not yet.
[370:29.73]Don't have to freak out yet.
[370:31.38]It's possible I can get in there again.
[370:39.63]Cat's head.
[370:41.35]Dark gray, beige.
[370:42.69]Alright.
[370:45.75]We're good.
[370:47.35]Thank god.
[370:49.31]We are good to go.
[370:49.87]It's gonna look a little sloppy, but it'll work.
[371:07.82]Somebody said the pattern's really all over the place anyways, so it wouldn't be hard.
[371:12.94]You can't really tell anyways.
[371:18.88]The room is ruined.
[371:20.25]What happened?
[371:20.55]What'd I do?
[371:21.87]Ruined?
[371:22.21]What's wrong?
[371:24.05]What's wrong with it?
[371:28.77]There's gonna be a grill there.
[371:29.67]You're not even gonna know.
[371:34.46]There's actually gonna be a bunch of random things in here.
[371:46.14]So why?
[371:51.85]Oh.
[371:55.81]Now it is ruined.
[371:57.13]But I can... Move it up?
[372:19.56]Alright, we're good.
[372:21.04]I think it's still going to be a little too long, though.
[372:36.78]It's almost like this thing in the middle is not... Because this is longer, so it almost needs to be longer, but it can't be longer.
[372:46.78]Maybe just bring these four.
[372:48.78]But that wouldn't look right.
[372:55.30]Sounds like I need another part of the wall.
[373:03.25]I can't do that because it's an external wall too.
[373:05.35]Damn it.
[373:09.37]It'll be alright.
[373:11.59]Plus I can do a little bit like... I can do some of the crushed stone around here.
[373:16.52]Have, like, a little path leading off and... Yeah, we'll be good.
[373:19.08]We'll be here very much.
[373:19.94]We should crush stone.
[373:20.68]Because there's going to be something here, too.
[373:37.11]Alright, let me ask you guys what's worse.
[373:38.97]Ready?
[373:39.61]What's worse?
[373:40.88]That or this?
[373:42.44]This.
[374:03.56]This is better?
[374:06.76]The sand actually is causing the problem.
[374:16.67]Yeah, it's the sand.
[374:19.79]It's the sand.
[374:26.64]Because the middle point is...
[374:35.54]You know, I don't even... I don't even... You can't even tell.
[374:40.00]That's fine.
[374:41.06]Look, take a... Ready?
[374:41.76]If you're walking around, you talk, oh yeah, cool, there's gonna be some stuff here, there'll be like a... You won't be able to really tell.
[374:50.47]Yeah, this is fine.
[375:13.40]Look, I'm going to take your eyes off it right now.
[375:17.62]You're not even going to know that it existed.
[375:18.92]How do you turn them on?
[375:51.98]Isn't it supposed to be water?
[375:56.56]Water wall?
[375:58.82]Lights, here we go.
[376:00.56]Yellow.
[376:10.26]We're gonna have, like, water waves.
[376:15.13]You won't even be able to know this is going on here.
[377:00.29]Urinals.
[377:10.17]I just want to see what they did.
[377:11.19]No, alright.
[377:15.81]Let's build it.
[377:16.33]Let's build it up.
[377:17.53]Come on.
[377:18.13]Here we go.
[377:19.37]Grill.
[377:21.89]The most expensive one.
[377:23.31]A bed grill.
[377:24.13]What?
[377:27.05]Here we go.
[377:27.93]Take a look.
[377:29.65]Grill.

[377:47.84]I want a bigger fire pit than this.
[377:53.17]Here it is.

[377:56.44]Right there.
[377:57.00]Let's get that out there.
[378:08.53]This needs to be over here, though.
[378:12.71]Out further.

[378:16.07]There we go.
[378:16.89]Nice grill.
[378:17.59]Got a couple of chairs there.
[378:18.55]Can I turn it on?
[378:19.07]Turn it on!
[378:22.46]Talk to the grill.
[378:24.06]I actually just pressed E. Alright, now we start to go... Okay, grill, fire pit.

[378:38.87]Give me some nice chairs.
[378:40.69]Chair.

[380:39.42]Alright.
[380:40.80]Um, do I have to kneel at this table?
[380:48.98]It's a table to kneel at.
[380:50.88]Why is everything yellow?
[380:52.08]Everything's not yellow.
[380:54.62]Just the house, the chairs, half of the plants.

[386:22.01]This house is not your house?
[386:26.53]I don't have room for a pool, actually.

[388:42.99]That's fine.
[388:46.83]They're not real.
[388:47.45]I do want to get around.
[388:58.54]I can't.

[389:46.74]I'm not- what do you mean, pool?
[389:47.86]I already have a gnome.
[389:53.92]Did you not see the gnome?
[389:58.29]Can you find it?
[389:58.87]You sure you can't find it?
[390:13.24]I need something right here.
[390:14.08]I'm going to do a line of bushes.
[390:17.23]Small bushes.
[390:17.79]Just the same bush.
[390:19.37]A line of them.
[390:19.83]Right against the house.
[390:22.89]Point five.
[390:23.57]Rose bush.
[390:25.37]Done.

[390:36.57]Better.
[390:37.79]There it is.
[390:38.33]Okay.
[390:38.69]Nice, nice, nice.
[390:42.82]Check this out.
[390:45.72]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[390:48.20]Watch.
[390:49.32]Watch this.
[391:06.79]I'm going for something fucking beautiful here.
[392:10.69]It's terrible.
[392:40.85]No, I Wait Guys, I just typed into Google beautiful garden and I'm just trying to replicate it
[393:09.83]I'm just trying to replicate beautiful garden, alright?
[393:12.47]I just need regular bush.
[393:29.88]Plagiarizing a garden.
[393:33.34]Oh man, I can't believe you- I liked you.
[393:36.56]I can't believe you're plagiarizing a garden.
[393:48.67]Where is it?
[393:50.73]That's close.
[393:51.27]That's close enough.
[394:01.12]I can't do another color?
[394:03.40]There we go.
[394:16.41]Is that right?
[394:17.97]Not really.
[394:20.70]Oh, that looks bad.
[394:27.55]This used to be a swindle stone stream.
[394:29.81]You haven't been around in like four years.
[394:38.48]Lettuce?
[394:38.78]There we go.
[395:23.24]That's just, you know, this is like candy.
[395:30.17]I need like dirt or something.
[395:44.76]It's something here.
[395:49.77]I feel like I'm getting too obsessed with the fact that it's a garden flipper and I'm just putting tons of flowers and plants and shit everywhere.
[396:00.00]I might as well just go to the end here.
[396:05.80]Make a swamp?
[396:06.78]I don't think I even can.
[396:08.30]These need to be closer.
[396:19.79]I have not even remotely been inside the house.
[396:23.75]No.
[396:25.27]I still need to put grass down here.
[396:26.71]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[396:46.18]Fuck the grass.
[397:05.21]Smokers get grappled.
[397:08.11]Wait, this goes here?
[397:09.10]Ow, my stomach.
[397:19.64]Somebody said graham cracker.
[397:27.42]That's not even what it looks like.
[397:36.14]That does not look like a graham cracker.
[397:38.16]I don't know why, but it's funny to me for some reason.
[397:42.62]Alright, let me lay grass down in the last few places, and then... We can go in the house!
[397:52.05]By the way, I don't give a shit about anything inside of this house.
[398:00.02]We're gonna...
[398:03.01]I spent so much time like out there.
[398:05.53]It's alright, I'm still going.
[398:09.97]Any more graham cracker?
[398:14.84]No, we can do grass here.
[398:15.68]Give me the roller.
[398:31.91]Turn the inside of the house into a garden as well.
[398:33.55]I wish you could.
[398:34.13]You unfortunately cannot bring anything that is an outdoor tool inside.
[398:41.64]I know.
[398:43.14]And I got that perfectly.
[398:44.72]First time ever, first try.
[398:54.04]Almost did it again.
[398:54.66]Oops.
[399:03.48]Doghouse?
[399:04.16]I know, I'll get the dog.
[399:05.33]I still have to make a circus.
[399:08.07]I don't have enough land to make a circus.
[399:13.71]How was I ever gonna do that?
[399:21.04]There's no way I can make a circus.
[399:33.81]You could do it in the garage.
[399:38.00]I guess, yeah, I guess I could do the circus in the garage.
[400:03.21]Garage circuit Come on get the last little bit of grass Right to the door
[400:32.38]Come on, right in the corner.
[400:35.06]Got it.
[400:35.34]Alright, nice.
[400:43.57]Gravel the house.
[400:44.39]I can't gravel in the house.
[400:46.47]See, look.
[400:49.21]The game doesn't let you.
[400:50.05]The game doesn't want you to be able to do that.
[400:53.35]Oh my god, what the hell.
[400:56.95]Okay, we're fine.
[401:00.63]Alright, I need to fix this, and then we can finish up the outside.
[401:06.93]What was it?
[401:07.23]It was the two-colored, this one, dark one, all the way, tiny, right?
[401:12.31]Alright, here we go.
[401:12.94]Done.
[401:19.16]Done.
[401:19.36]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[401:24.36]So we've got pool, clown pit.
[401:27.44]I have to still plant all these.
[401:29.73]I didn't even do anything over here!
[401:44.85]That's fucking hard work.
[401:57.42]We're far from done.
[401:58.32]No, I told you I wasn't stopping.
[402:08.69]I must stop until the outside is completely done and there's at least a couch inside the house.
[402:17.46]Don't tell him.
[402:21.25]Don't tell me what?
[402:37.80]Don't tell him.
[402:38.66]I was... What are you guys not telling me?
[402:50.21]I've been playing this for almost seven hours.
[402:52.87]And that's the first skill point, I think, in seven hours.
[403:13.91]Hey, when it gets there, I'll have it.
[403:19.57]That looks alright.
[403:22.93]It's a little filled in back there.
[403:24.27]I could put something else back here though.
[403:35.64]Big tree, couple little trees.
[403:40.70]There's five trees in a square meter.
[403:44.13]Still don't understand this.
[403:45.43]I'm gonna have to do something interesting here because I'm not putting any more flowers Okay, no more flowers.
[403:52.23]No more.
[403:52.68]I got what am I putting here?
[403:58.44]The dog The dog stuff Holy shit, wait a minute
[404:18.94]How is this an outdoor cinema?
[404:28.01]This is just a giant TV.
[404:29.71]What does this mean, outdoor?
[405:53.14]Okay.
[405:55.54]And then... You could build a real life backyard?
[406:38.26]Projector?
[406:38.76]Projector?
[406:39.28]What are you guys talking about?
[406:40.14]What's wrong with the projector?
[406:51.87]Oh, you ta- you-
[407:04.75]Yeah, but this has to go on a table.
[407:06.01]I'm not just gonna... $700.
[407:09.42]Alright, hold on.
[407:31.09]No, give me, um...
[407:44.61]No more gravel, you're right.
[407:45.67]Fuck.
[407:52.59]What are you doing?
[407:53.15]Hey!
[408:36.44]Wrong side.
[408:37.02]Fuck.
[408:55.51]Just hold on, you'll see.
[409:20.29]Give me it!
[409:35.97]Why is this crooked?
[409:38.77]What?
[409:48.09]It's a motorcycle.
[409:49.85]It's a two motorcycle parking lot drive-in movie theater Bicycle drive-up movie theater Yes, it's a bicycle movie theater
[410:32.15]And, if you want to, you can stop at our garden.
[410:34.87]On the way over here.
[410:43.20]Pull up your fucking bike.
[410:44.50]I mean, yeah, the bricks just go another way.
[410:54.04]But that's fine.
[411:11.23]oh what what why is everybody freaking out I'm just making a little walkway
[411:46.85]Look, that looks much better.
[411:47.92]What are you talking about?
[411:48.84]What is wrong with this?
[412:08.99]I don't see the problem here.
[412:24.84]I'm gonna make one more here and you can take a little stroll.
[412:33.49]You won't let me do gravel.
[412:45.26]I went too quick.
[413:02.34]Give me a table.
[413:02.92]What's wrong with the simplicity of grass?
[413:11.28]Nothing, really.
[413:13.32]Nothing.
[413:16.47]This needs a thinner table.
[413:26.99]No, this is fucking ridiculous.
[413:28.43]Come here.
[413:33.50]Simple table.
[413:35.33]There we go.
[413:42.56]Is that level?
[414:14.73]Okay, here we go.
[414:23.96]What is a gym rope?
[414:25.34]A punching bag?
[414:28.28]The project- the projector's facing the wrong way.
[414:34.49]It's fine.
[415:10.18]Fresh pizza ready for you.
[415:39.62]Get this in here.
[415:48.62]Plant... Hold on.
[415:50.06]Plant tomatoes.
[415:59.75]Plant tomatoes.
[416:02.15]That's actually not a bad idea.
[416:06.89]We want food.
[416:08.55]Edible plants.
[416:10.42]What can you put on a pizza?
[416:12.46]Not grapes.
[416:13.32]Plums?
[416:13.88]No.
[416:15.23]Cherries?
[416:15.83]No.
[416:17.51]Apple?
[416:18.15]Apple.
[416:18.57]Blueberry?
[416:20.61]You don't put carrots on a pizza.
[416:22.52]You don't put pumpkin.
[416:26.76]There are no pineapples, guys.
[417:00.70]I'm just kidding, Jesus.
[417:03.74]The eight cents.
[417:05.10]It's not a big deal if I pretend to do this.
[417:07.24]Alright.
[417:21.05]There you go.
[417:26.27]Okay.
[417:29.42]I need something here.
[417:30.48]I need like a tree or something.
[417:34.22]This is empty over here.
[417:35.26]Very empty.
[417:36.20]Besides my little dumb walkway.
[417:47.19]No, I don't think it needs anything.
[417:48.17]I'm gonna put a gazebo.
[417:54.52]A gazebo will not fit here.
[418:12.51]No, I'm not fucking doing that.
[418:17.11]Let me make a nice little thing here, hold on.
[418:21.78]Let me get the erect shrubs.
[418:24.22]I like the default ones, they look okay.
[418:38.48]We're just gonna let the brush just go on the paper.
[418:44.98]I'm not going to think about it.
[418:45.97]Just let the brush flow across the canvas.
[418:50.53]Let me think in here.
[418:51.11]Where are we going?
[419:14.21]Ah, okay, something else, something... Let's get a nice little display here from these little ones.
[420:00.97]Is this what I had before?
[420:01.87]Yeah, it's the same one I had before.
[420:15.14]Not thinking about it.
[420:15.78]I'm not thinking about it.
[420:16.52]Let's just go.
[420:16.92]I'm not thinking about it at all.
[420:18.12]Okay.
[420:35.14]I don't think that's that bad.
[420:50.13]Attention streamer, you have too many plants.
[420:52.03]Oh, I mean, the name of this game is Garden Flipper.
[421:04.59]I'm gonna make a huge, elaborate display.
[421:09.29]Think of the water bill.
[421:16.47]This is not called Don't Put Plants Anywhere DLC, this is Garden- The Garden DLC.
[421:26.52]I'm gonna make an elaborate fucking piece.
[421:28.08]Lookit, this is actually- I don't have- I'm just wait til- I'm gonna go back over there and we'll do some more cleanup.
[421:54.36]Million-dollar sprinkler system.
[421:58.12]This is it for plants, though.
[421:59.02]This is gonna be it for plants, because then I'm gonna put, like, the fucking... ...clown stuff in the garage, and you'll be happy.
[422:14.61]Imagine if the neighbor was allergic to pollen.
[422:20.11]He'll be okay.
[422:22.91]I need a bomb for like a couple of rock or something.
[422:34.71]This is like a lot here.
[422:36.62]I'm gonna move this.
[422:38.40]This is why you think it's too busy, because it's too far up.
[422:51.04]Better.
[422:51.76]Much better.
[422:59.11]Maybe a little bit of gravel?
[422:59.93]No.
[423:00.11]I think that's okay.
[423:02.94]This needs something in here.
[423:04.46]Something to take it... Hold on.
[423:09.88]I need, like, something in here.
[423:11.12]You're gonna be mad about this, but I'm just adding a couple more.
[423:16.76]Like, one, two.
[423:20.86]Rocks, maybe.
[423:26.53]Some little ones.
[423:31.80]No.
[423:40.74]No, I think that's alright.
[423:41.52]This one's gotta go.
[423:43.60]That one's fucking the whole thing up.
[423:44.74]And that one.
[423:46.52]And... And this one.
[423:53.36]And that one.
[423:56.69]And that one.
[424:05.69]What about over here?
[424:06.37]Something's gotta go over here.
[424:22.10]I've never had a house like this.
[424:23.80]I've never had a garden.
[424:24.74]I'm just trying to make a cool garden.
[424:26.26]I've never had one before.
[424:27.98]I've never had a cool garden.
[424:31.09]Should I do water walls?
[424:32.57]I've never had this much money to make whatever I want.
[424:37.90]You have five gardens.
[424:44.49]Play some windmill.
[424:47.87]I've never had a garden before.
[424:53.26]That looks good.
[424:54.92]Look at that.
[424:55.44]That kind of ties the whole thing together.
[425:06.12]Now it's finally mini golf.
[425:11.21]Alright, I'm... No more.
[425:13.15]I'm done.
[425:13.71]I'm losing my fucking mind.
[425:15.11]Okay, I'm not... No more.
[425:17.14]I just need to clean this part up.
[425:40.33]I need to tie this together here.
[425:42.63]I need this, because this is, I like, don't hate this.
[425:45.86]What about, uh, a path?
[425:48.36]Like, I could do a path, but that has to start from over here, and yes, it will.
[425:55.38]That's not the right one, mom.
[425:57.38]Did I say ma?
[425:58.71]Like, calling you guys mom?
[426:01.91]That's not the right one, ma.
[426:06.21]It's this one, right?
[426:06.93]Okay, it is.
[426:14.98]Let me just see what this looks like.
[426:16.76]Is that right?
[426:19.32]Is this one?
[427:18.39]okay not bad not bad I gotta clean this back up though because this is not now this is no longer don't need this a couple more stones
[428:21.11]Yes!
[428:43.91]Give us a tour.
[428:44.49]Not yet.
[428:44.83]Not done.
[428:46.41]I'm not done.
[428:47.23]Not done.
[428:47.53]Not done.
[428:50.47]Something's gotta be here.
[428:51.45]Something's gotta go right here.
[428:52.47]I'm sorry, it does.
[428:53.11]That's just the way it is.
[428:59.39]That space is freaking me out.
[429:00.67]I need something.
[429:01.05]I need to hide it.
[429:01.49]Uh, how about... It's like a light or something.
[429:26.20]No, no, that's fine.
[429:26.92]Negative space, you're right.
[429:28.04]What about one of these stones to go away?
[429:34.75]Much better.
[429:36.51]Ten times better.
[429:39.17]See, I am removing things.
[429:40.69]You guys thought I was just throwing shit.
[429:41.87]I am removing things.
[430:01.72]I'll turn it around.
[430:02.34]I think this is good.
[430:37.29]that rock back.
[430:38.17]No, I can't.
[430:42.62]What about here?
[430:44.27]This feels pretty empty.
[431:08.55]I don't like any of this.
[431:09.63]I don't like this.
[431:12.27]I want to redo this whole thing.
[431:13.87]I don't... This is... I don't like this.
[431:15.21]This is too much open space.
[431:21.38]There needs to be more of this.
[431:31.29]I need like a...
[431:37.19]Oh, that's okay.
[431:37.67]That's fine.
[431:38.01]That looks alright.
[431:39.59]That's better.
[431:45.55]That's better.
[431:46.03]I feel much better now.
[431:46.77]A nice lamp?
[431:49.84]Let's get a big lamp.
[431:59.51]How big are these?
[432:00.63]Here we go.
[432:28.31]That's a, uh... That is a street lamp, so yeah, never mind.
[432:31.55]Is that... Is this Knuckles?
[432:41.36]No.
[432:48.54]I can't put it inside.
[432:56.11]Ball pits are the only thing they can go in here, apparently, for some reason.
[432:59.79]Can a carousel go in here?
[433:01.03]Okay, it can.
[433:04.21]Carousel.
[433:07.52]The little kid's house.
[433:09.32]Little fun playhouse.
[433:20.53]Alright, I gotta assemble it.
[433:28.83]What's going on?
[433:30.92]I can't do that now.
[433:34.42]What can you not do?
[433:52.65]This is the garage.
[433:53.55]I can't put the circus in here.
[434:17.68]No pictures.
[434:18.28]I want a place for my documents.
[434:23.71]I think I'm ready to go inside.
[434:25.79]Would you like a tour of the outside?
[434:27.31]Not yet.
[434:27.75]No, no.
[434:28.11]We gotta do the whole thing.
[434:28.77]Let's make some walls here.
[434:39.09]What do we got?
[434:40.61]This room sucks.
[434:41.79]Change it.
[434:43.51]This is going to be a bathroom.
[434:46.03]No, closet.
[434:47.57]Watch this.
[434:57.30]I don't want that.
[434:58.30]This looks ugly.
[435:02.38]Let's do some paint.
[435:05.03]I'm thinking...
[435:10.38]Light biscuit on the walls, maybe?
[435:16.87]Let's see what light biscuit looks like.
[435:18.15]Yeah, it's been 7 hours and 15 minutes and I finally made it inside.
[435:27.14]That was a 7 hour garden.
[435:39.36]No, this is gonna be a home office.
[435:44.24]Yeah, this is an office.
[435:59.54]The whole tour is gonna take like 25 minutes.
[436:01.90]It's gonna be a long tour.
[436:12.17]flesh walls.
[436:12.83]These are the color of the walls in my room right now.
[436:18.37]This is what it looks like in my room now.
[436:23.58]Not a flesh wall.
[436:24.48]It's a... Yeah, I don't know.
[436:27.40]Tinted cigarette ash?
[436:28.86]Whatever it is.
[436:30.12]Cigarette?
[436:32.00]Yeah, I would call this a cigarette yellow.
[436:37.92]Like cigarette tar.
[436:42.05]It works good for an office or a closet.
[436:45.73]I can reach it.
[436:46.23]I'm fine.
[436:51.39]Did I just shrink?
[436:56.49]Did I shrink?
[436:57.33]Look at me.
[436:59.59]What?
[437:03.11]Maybe I should use a scaffolding to get to the... That's not... I don't need to do that.
[437:12.91]Why would I put a scaffolding in the house?
[437:20.68]It is not too high.
[437:22.58]I'm not going to get shown up here.
[437:24.94]Too high, huh?
[437:26.64]We're good.
[437:28.50]Alright.
[437:29.33]This wall here.
[437:30.05]We'll get an accent color.
[437:36.87]Maybe a... What's a little accent?
[437:42.02]What do you think?
[437:44.01]Kappa?
[437:45.37]I see one gray.
[438:01.42]Why do I need a scaffolding to reach this shit?
[438:03.54]That's so stupid.
[438:05.46]I have a long pole.
[438:09.19]Did my character shrunk?
[438:10.37]Okay, what do we want for our accent color?
[438:13.97]In here, around the windows.
[438:16.52]Gray?
[438:20.12]Silver glacier?
[438:26.10]Steel gray?
[438:28.47]Purple.
[438:29.71]Purple?
[438:32.31]Like a lavender, or... Quartz.
[438:35.33]Quartz.
[438:43.84]Lavender.
[438:47.23]Quartz, quartz, quartz.
[439:07.96]Um... This looks like a fucking jelly donut room.
[439:14.89]you picked it I didn't I mean I'm yeah you guys picked it
[439:44.80]Why is this wall... I swear to God, this is a weird optical illusion where it looks... I feel like I'm shrinking.
[439:52.16]But I'm tall enough over here, but I'm shrinking over here.
[440:00.33]This is freaking me out a little bit, I'm not gonna lie.
[440:15.75]Okay.
[440:16.99]See, look it.
[440:17.61]I'm not even... Something really fucked up is going on.
[440:21.75]Because I'm tall enough over here?
[440:23.47]What is this house?
[440:29.68]How tall are these ceilings?
[440:31.46]These ceilings are like 30 feet tall.
[440:34.14]Oh, I'm standing on the paint can.
[440:36.96]Okay.
[440:40.57]Alright.
[440:41.15]Carpet color.
[440:41.71]The first color I see in chat is the one that's going in here.
[440:45.05]Carpet color.
[440:45.57]What do you got?
[440:46.48]First color I see.
[440:47.20]Don't care what it is.
[440:47.80]Red.
[440:48.64]Why does it have to be red?
[441:05.94]Can I even do red?
[441:10.58]Okay, there's no red.
[441:15.60]I don't, there's no red.
[441:16.76]So we're gonna have to do something else.
[441:30.03]This looks like shit, no.
[441:43.63]That looks alright.
[441:44.21]I like that.
[441:45.61]Oh, I like that because that's... Look.
[441:53.95]That's the wall.
[441:54.99]Yeah.
[441:59.41]The blue... Alright, I'll try the blue.
[442:00.74]I'll give it another chance.
[442:20.18]It's alright.
[442:21.08]Okay.
[442:31.53]What color is this carpet?
[442:32.49]This carpet is like a white with beige.
[442:38.57]Beige, white, little bit of tan.
[442:41.97]The walls are like a sand.
[442:51.41]This is a Pee Wee Herman room.
[442:52.78]Alright, well this is supposed to be- this is the office.
[442:55.50]So we need a desk.
[442:58.90]A nice one.
[442:59.62]The nicest one you can buy.
[443:00.50]This is the desk that I currently have right now.
[443:04.46]Is there walnut?
[443:14.01]How could you not have- It's on walnut.
[443:16.79]Alright.
[443:31.40]Okay, let's get a chair.
[443:32.96]Office chair.
[443:35.81]Looks pretty good.
[443:36.45]I like that kind of sandstone look.
[443:42.63]Computer in here.
[443:43.23]A good computer.
[443:49.98]Computer brushy.
[443:52.50]Computer phoenix.
[443:54.10]Computer sphinx.
[443:56.78]Well, that's the best one we can buy, so we're gonna get it.
[444:08.40]Let's get the monitor.
[444:11.67]So we need a lot of them.
[444:16.33]We need at least two.
[444:17.71]Okay.
[444:18.05]I didn't think it was going to be that big.
[444:29.96]That is a very large monitor.
[444:37.35]Now you're gaming.
[444:39.71]Yeah, we're dropping a bunch of- How are we dropping this many frames at, like, 11 o'clock at night?
[444:44.35]It's like, that doesn't even make sense.
[444:48.66]We had, like, seven hours of, like, green internet, and now at, like, 11 p.m.?
[444:55.38]What the fuck?
[444:56.38]Are you serious?
[444:59.32]This is literally my boyfriend's setup.
[445:06.05]That's an interesting setup.
[445:08.31]Press C. How long was I crouched for?
[445:20.08]I may have been crouched.
[445:34.65]The whole game.
[445:50.41]No, I didn't notice because... You look at... You walk the same speed!
[445:58.69]You just lower to the ground!
[446:05.94]That's why I couldn't reach the shit, like, eight hours ago.
[446:08.86]Oh my god.
[446:12.08]I'm just gonna finish my office, please.
[446:18.52]Alright, I need a mouse.
[446:30.16]And it's in gamer grub.
[446:38.20]Where's my sardines?
[447:04.69]Why do I have it in the office?
[447:05.59]So I can snack on them.
[447:07.22]I just mute the microphone.
[447:08.14]I just start eating.
[447:10.69]Dwarf soup?
[447:11.33]That's odd.
[447:28.83]A propane tank onto your desk.
[447:32.21]Alright, that's good.
[447:33.77]We need a little bit of a, uh, let's see.
[447:37.21]Furniture.
[447:37.65]We need, um, I don't know, maybe like a little bookcase?
[447:44.99]Yeah, this is nice.
[447:49.27]A little draw?
[447:52.09]A corner?
[447:54.75]What else?
[447:54.99]What do I have?
[447:55.75]What's in my office?
[447:58.29]A fuck you table.
[447:58.99]A closet.
[448:01.20]There's nothing else in here.
[448:05.48]What is it?
[448:09.32]A keyboard?
[448:13.86]There's not really a whole lot of room for this.
[448:30.01]Alright, well, new plan.
[448:34.13]You reach over and grab the box.
[448:36.03]Alright, like, at what point... At what point do you just figure out how to get a smaller monitor?
[448:51.98]Okay.
[449:01.55]You have to tilt your head to the left.
[449:03.05]You need to have a windmill in here to power the PC with clean energy.
[449:11.91]I don't think so.
[449:13.27]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[449:14.13]Alright, we need paint.
[449:19.38]Living room.
[449:23.46]Sierra Mist?
[449:27.06]Young Fly- I like this one.
[449:39.73]Peach?
[449:40.41]Peach might look alright.
[449:42.45]Peach or Velvety Peach?
[449:45.75]Which one?
[449:54.94]Velvety?
[449:58.24]I'll give it a trial run for you.
[450:10.38]How about bright peach?
[450:18.26]Let's try that one.
[450:18.94]It's a little lighter.
[450:27.91]It's better.
[450:40.47]They're not the same.
[450:58.28]No.
[451:02.24]You gotta do clown stripes?
[451:12.53]I just need to get a couch in here.
[451:18.30]The couch is the finishing touch.
[451:19.38]That means the house is done.
[451:22.80]And we can do our 35 minute tour.
[451:35.05]What about the ground in here?
[451:36.17]I'm thinking basil.
[451:54.35]Hey Lois, I'm a clown now.
[451:55.81]God.
[451:58.92]God damn.
[452:02.52]There are no lights?
[452:03.14]I'll put some lamps in here and stuff, it'll be fine.
[452:08.91]No, we're not doing another ice cream shop!
[452:12.09]This is gonna be a regular house!
[452:26.13]That house was so fucked up.
[452:27.77]There was a mall on the bottom floor and an ice cream shop at the top.
[452:34.12]You guys thought I was on drugs this stream.
[452:37.94]What the hell was wrong with me on that one?
[452:53.02]Yeah, this is like standard apartment building.
[452:55.32]It doesn't matter.
[453:17.33]No, I'm not doing the Family Guy house.
[453:18.93]Where did you get that information from?
[453:22.80]Is he really doing the Family Guy house?
[453:24.26]Where'd you get that info?
[453:27.91]I didn't say that.
[453:29.69]That's not info from me.
[453:47.02]Am I still doing this?
[453:47.76]Yeah, this is gonna be a long one.
[453:51.13]This will be at least... This is gonna be like at least a 9 hour stream.
[453:54.85]At least.
[453:56.88]Hey, I've got the internet.
[453:57.88]I'm gonna use it.
[453:59.24]Skill point.
[454:02.54]Max upgraded painting.
[454:05.55]Well, that's quick.
[454:22.28]Have a few stripes to break it up.
[454:25.59]Yeah, once I get it all painted, we'll do a little bit of detail work.
[454:35.42]I'm not kidding, it does look like the Family Guy house, even from the inside.
[454:43.76]Oh my god.
[454:50.19]Oh my god, it is the Family Guy house.
[454:52.13]Here's the door.
[454:53.91]That, like, and then this couch, and the TV, and the stairs.
[455:03.42]And then the kitchen.
[455:08.12]It's the Family Guy house.
[455:17.59]Somebody look right now.
[455:20.06]I don't know how you can do this.
[455:20.96]Is there a door right here next?
[455:22.52]Right here?
[455:23.60]To the front door?
[455:33.07]This is not... No.
[455:36.27]So it's not the Family Guy house, see?
[455:39.33]All these similarities, you're just... You're making them up in your head.
[455:46.68]Holy crap, Lois.
[455:48.10]It's the famous streamer, Jerma985.
[455:51.18]Oh, God.
[456:08.19]Where's Chris's room?
[456:09.93]No, I'm not doing that.
[456:12.33]I don't care.
[456:23.31]I'm in orange hell right now.
[456:26.08]But you have to wait.
[456:26.76]I have to break it up and do accent work.
[456:29.84]Yes, you're currently in orange hell.
[456:31.36]But this is what painters do.
[456:33.36]They get ready.
[456:35.46]And then they finish with other colors.
[456:41.45]It's not.
[456:41.97]It's not.
[456:42.43]Alright, alright.
[456:42.99]Hold on.
[456:43.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[456:46.07]I'm thinking like a darker purple.
[456:50.39]Or like a...
[456:52.02]A white.
[456:52.96]No, a white guys.
[456:54.32]It's gonna be white.
[457:19.30]Orange hill.
[457:22.93]This is ultra generic.
[457:25.23]Well, we have to mute it a little bit because look at the fucking clown circus that's outside.
[457:31.56]We have to have a normal house on the inside of it.
[457:37.60]Is this too boring for you?
[457:40.34]Is it too boring?
[457:50.63]I'm not gonna do rainbow walls.
[457:54.98]You guys are fucking crazy.
[458:04.42]What a shitty house that would be.
[458:06.86]I would throw up in every room.
[458:08.33]If every room was a rainbow, it would just be like you wouldn't be able to look at it.
[458:14.47]He's doubling down on being boring now because the outside was so fucked up.
[458:19.11]I...
[458:19.65]I'm... I'm sorry!
[458:21.13]Here you go.
[458:40.26]You want your fucking... You want your donut house?
[458:43.44]Here.
[458:44.46]Each room is themed around a different fucking filling.
[459:20.53]Yeah, this is strawberry.
[459:24.11]Now you're pandering.
[459:25.03]Actually, I kind of like this.
[459:27.89]I really actually like what I just did over here.
[459:31.13]I do, I do.
[459:39.50]I actually don't mind that at all.
[459:45.17]Alright, so, let's take a look.
[459:48.19]Although I could have it without, I could do without on this wall.
[459:53.27]Yeah, no.
[459:53.95]In fact, we're gonna go from there, we're gonna go to Sunny Orange.
[460:01.35]It is a circus tent.
[460:02.47]Oh, fuck.
[460:03.61]Whatever.
[460:06.64]It's not a circus tent.
[460:20.81]It's not a circus tent.
[460:22.75]A circus tent doesn't look like this.
[460:27.03]It's a house.
[460:28.79]A house standing on four legs.
[460:32.15]Breathing pure oxygen.
[460:34.07]That's too much.
[460:44.62]Uh, it's gotta be a morning yellow.
[460:48.85]Let me see what the red actually looks like over here.
[460:50.86]It might not look terrible.
[460:57.55]Oops.
[461:19.29]Try blue What kind of blue like a light blue dark blue like a royal blue
[461:54.54]That looks good.
[462:04.79]Family Guy Blue.
[462:12.59]No, Family Guy Blue is a little darker than this.
[462:19.73]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[462:21.78]I swear to God.
[462:23.74]Stewie's room.
[462:24.70]How do you even remember that?
[462:28.78]How do- I don't even know what that- How do you even remember this?
[462:39.96]That seems almost impossible to remember!
[462:50.48]Why is there no door leading to the yard?
[462:51.94]Because as of right now, I had to put down these and they were getting in the way.
[462:58.54]So I had to pull them up.
[463:03.46]We watch Family Guy so we can make the references on your stream.
[463:07.38]Well, nice job.
[463:08.94]You got it.
[463:10.64]Those are pretty good references.
[463:21.20]Alright.
[463:22.92]This needs to be redone.
[463:25.64]Is this the right color?
[463:28.42]No.
[463:30.13]Where is it?
[463:30.43]Right there.
[463:31.39]Right there.
[463:41.57]I mean, yellow and... I mean, blue and brown go together very well.
[463:45.22]They just do.
[463:46.94]Tons of schemes.
[463:48.38]Alright, with blue and brown.
[463:56.27]Let's get some appliances in here.
[463:57.37]No, look at a tile of ground.
[464:02.26]Floor tile for the kitchen.
[464:05.14]We could do checkerboard.
[464:15.30]We could do... Is there a beige?
[464:18.45]This one?
[464:18.89]Sepia?
[464:27.59]That's giving me a headache.
[464:31.87]How about this one?
[464:40.41]Not bad.
[464:42.24]Is it worse?
[464:53.70]Something's going on over there.
[465:11.28]I'm not going to have a brick bathroom.
[465:22.24]Now, this is Rocko's modern life.
[465:25.98]It's really easy for a house to turn into Rocko's modern life in this game.
[465:29.55]Let's just go with this one.
[465:37.71]That's better.
[465:38.69]Just wood.
[465:40.45]Wood floors.
[465:41.05]Looks good.
[465:55.24]Except for over here.
[466:08.33]Now the paint doesn't match.
[466:09.33]Well, I'm going to do... Let's see.
[466:11.59]What am I going to do?
[466:12.05]A carpet in here?
[466:16.57]I'm thinking... A... One of these.
[466:20.96]Let's see how this looks.
[466:23.68]What is this doing?
[466:35.75]This is the carpet in this room right now.
[466:46.08]No.
[466:46.82]Let's go with, um... Rug gray?
[466:54.36]Rug patterned.
[466:55.38]Rug gray.
[466:56.32]Let's try the gray.
[467:00.43]What?
[467:01.27]Oh, these are just rugs.
[467:14.53]Floor panels and coverings.
[467:15.77]I mean... Pine?
[467:22.73]Just do wood through the whole house?
[467:30.69]What's with millennials?
[467:32.81]And wooden floors?
[467:34.95]What's going on there?
[467:36.05]That's a millennial thing.
[467:46.02]I want the high... Not the low cut, I want the really fabric-y carpet around my whole house.
[467:54.13]The long-haired carpet.
[468:07.21]Carpet is disgusting, revolting.
[468:12.37]Yeah, but when you walk around on wood...
[468:15.15]Everybody in the whole house can hear you.
[468:18.21]It's, it's, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[468:20.67]You're like an elephant up there.
[468:26.60]Carpets, it's like,
[468:47.21]It's funny, I'm... I'm being, like, a fake internet troll right now.
[468:53.63]Because I love wooden floors.
[468:58.25]I'm just being one of those, just, like, fucking accounts that just goes on and just says whatever the... It's just anything that they do.
[469:04.47]Anything.
[469:05.31]To, like, get somebody to be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[469:08.35]I'm just, like, LARP... Yeah, I'm LARPing right now.
[469:12.46]Dark wooden floors are my favorite thing in the world.
[469:22.10]They really are.
[469:22.68]Peter Griffin-Larper.
[469:33.42]You guys are making me, like, laugh too much.
[469:36.18]What's with, like, the comedy troupe here?
[469:39.33]You guys have been, like, on point today with, like, the comedy.
[469:42.03]Alright, let's go.
[469:51.67]Please put more in the computer room.
[469:54.75]I will.
[469:55.11]Don't worry.
[469:55.37]I will.
[469:57.24]I will.
[469:57.50]Let me just get this down.
[469:58.44]I've got doors here.
[470:01.48]This is closed.
[470:03.44]I've got to put the other doors on here.
[470:10.62]I'm going to do dark.
[470:20.36]Never mind.
[470:31.69]Can this not fit?
[470:36.35]Why can this not fit?
[470:45.36]It's because of this shit right here.
[470:46.92]The lip.
[470:48.02]It's alright, I got it in.
[470:55.26]I'm hungry.
[470:58.78]What do I eat?
[470:59.22]I'm hungry.
[471:01.96]I'm forcing myself to stay awake to watch you.
[471:04.09]Don't fuck it up.
[471:04.77]I won't.
[471:08.79]Do you see the garden that I made?
[471:10.59]You're in good hands here.
[471:12.83]Alright.
[471:13.57]Computer room.
[471:15.00]Bathroom.
[471:22.18]Eat the sandwich that's been in the car for eight months.
[471:27.20]I don't even have that car.
[471:29.60]I don't have that sandwich.
[471:31.95]I'm not at that house.
[471:53.08]So many windows here.
[471:55.32]What is seriously with the windows?
[471:57.45]There's a window.
[471:58.17]They're everywhere.
[471:58.97]This house is so bizarre.
[472:06.21]Tile.
[472:06.61]Wall tile.
[472:16.40]Hmm.
[472:19.38]I'm interested in what this does.
[472:21.80]Let's see.
[472:24.46]Alright.
[472:25.06]Yeah.
[472:30.75]I didn't give you a warning on that one.
[472:31.95]I'm sorry.
[472:32.31]I didn't have a warning Why am I sneezing so much today?
[472:38.69]I don't sneeze this much ever The carpet no, it's not the carpet.
[472:52.60]Oh
[472:56.24]What do I feel like eating?
[472:58.63]Dude, am I going to get a pizza?
[473:02.41]I'm going to give you guys a little bit of an insight here.
[473:05.23]I know that people think I eat pizza every day.
[473:10.07]Because I always say, you know what?
[473:11.09]I'm thinking about a pepperoni pizza.
[473:12.65]I don't do it.
[473:13.98]I don't get it.
[473:20.12]Like three out of six streams.
[473:23.20]I say I'm going to get a pepperoni pizza delivered to the house.
[473:27.70]You guys must think I'm like a sicko.
[473:45.57]Actually, I like this.
[473:46.29]This looks nice.
[473:47.83]Just need a bathtub.
[473:56.46]Thinking about eating pizza is not weird.
[473:58.18]No, but saying I'm gonna eat pizza every day is a little weird.
[474:02.19]And then I go downstairs.
[474:04.65]And I have, like, spinach and pasta.
[474:06.71]I was thinking about getting a pepperoni pizza today.
[474:14.44]I am hungry, though.
[474:16.52]Mmm.
[474:19.76]Are we going eight hours here?
[474:23.80]Um, a quick question.
[474:29.05]I've only left this room one time in eight hours.
[474:33.29]Is that true?
[474:40.95]Yeah, that did happen.
[474:42.83]Okay.
[474:44.45]Alright.
[474:44.83]Yeah, I went to go get a glass of wine like seven hours ago.
[474:51.08]Let me go pee and get some water.
[474:53.54]And maybe grab a snack.
[474:58.27]I'll be right back.
[475:01.57]Didn't even pee, yeah.
[475:03.79]No.
[475:06.54]I'll be right back.
[475:07.72]We'll finish up here.
[475:10.42]See you very, very soon.
[477:48.16]literally walked downstairs and Kim made pasta.
[477:54.82]It was already ready.
[477:56.81]Beautiful.
[477:59.23]Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
[478:02.97]So I'm going to be a piece of crap and I'm going to mute and paint walls.
[478:08.89]She's wonderful.
[478:09.49]Yes, she is.
[478:15.90]So let's try this.
[478:18.45]Paint the walls with pasta.
[478:22.95]Don't mute.
[478:23.46]No, I'm gonna mute.
[478:26.56]20% of the people that think this is funny, 80% of the people think this is the worst thing they've ever heard in their life.
[479:08.58]It feels weird.
[479:11.82]To sit here.
[479:13.90]I can't do it.
[479:14.44]I'm so used to just talking.
[479:18.20]I'm just staring at this.
[479:20.81]Hey.
[479:22.15]What's up?
[479:24.13]You guys just hanging out too?
[479:45.29]I'm doing the equivalent of keyboard turning in World of Warcraft.
[479:48.76]I'm playing with one hand.
[480:22.49]How's the pasta?
[480:23.85]I haven't even tried it.
[480:24.61]Let me try it.
[480:25.05]Let's get a piece on here.
[480:31.69]Oh!
[480:33.01]What?
[480:33.75]Oh!
[480:58.10]All his bones breaking.
[481:12.63]I can't even say this.
[481:14.79]Because that wouldn't even do it.
[481:18.46]Cad said, toenail in the pasta.
[481:27.30]Why would it make that loud of a noise?
[481:43.25]No, that was somebody dumped sand in your pasta.
[481:48.25]A lot of it.
[481:50.41]A point where you can visibly see it on the plate.
[482:21.14]Let's go back to it.
[482:26.86]Sand pasta.
[482:31.70]That's disgusting.
[482:33.92]Just disgusting.
[482:39.30]What was I doing with this?
[482:41.74]Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[482:47.73]Then what should I do for the ground?
[482:56.79]Now, by the way, upstairs is going to be just a giant bedroom.
[482:59.85]There's going to be a bed at the end of the hall.
[483:03.29]And a bunch of potted plants.
[483:11.80]Nice.
[483:13.42]I always hate when people have windows into the bathrooms.
[483:16.92]Especially, give a go to somebody, maybe some of you guys have a house like this.
[483:20.02]Give a go to somebody's house.
[483:22.11]just making sure it wasn't crushed, who has a window in the bathroom at penile level, where you're peeing and there's a window that is at, it's like, it's at like balls level.
[483:39.99]If that thing is not closed, if there's no curtain or even curtains, I feel like somebody could see right through it.
[483:47.91]That's way more common than you think it is.
[483:52.42]I have this weird, fucked up fear of peeing in somebody's house that has a penile window.
[484:00.81]And for some reason, I just think of like, the curtain, or the blinds, somebody, you know how, you know if you go far enough away from blinds, you can kind of see a little bit?
[484:13.52]I just feel like somebody is going to see right through one of the little cracks of a Venetian blind, and just see my penis.
[484:23.05]They don't even need to see me.
[484:25.27]They might not even know who's in the bathroom.
[484:27.61]And, like, I get out of the bathroom and it could have been anybody.
[484:30.82]But I don't like that.
[484:40.43]I don't like that.
[484:41.01]I don't want that.
[484:54.66]He likes that.
[484:55.42]I don't like that.
[484:56.08]I don't like that.
[485:07.03]But it is a little bizarre.
[485:11.92]When you go to a bathroom that is like that.
[485:13.50]Okay.
[485:21.43]Okay.
[485:25.26]Almost done with the bathroom?
[485:29.39]How many more of these do I need?
[485:46.48]Do they only... No, I'm just saying, like, through one of the little blinds, they just... You know what I mean.
[485:52.87]This is a PG-13 stream.
[485:53.59]We don't have to get into R-related details.
[486:05.40]Yes, we do.
[486:06.58]No, we don't.
[486:13.47]pg-13 is not family friendly they say the f word they say the s word they say mean things it's the same yeah you can say at least once in a yeah you can say one time in a pg-13 movie that's new
[486:42.42]He did it twice, oh no.
[486:50.98]Alright, remind me to not tile a wall ever again.
[486:57.42]This takes as long as it takes to eat a bowl of pasta.
[487:15.90]It's a long time.
[487:18.54]It's a very long time.
[487:26.70]Done.
[487:27.08]Alright, so let's take another bite.
[487:34.16]And I'm gonna make the bathtub, shower, and sink in the bathroom.
[487:51.55]Hmm.
[488:00.04]This is like a weird digital pixel room.
[488:14.79]I don't like it, but whatever, Stan.
[488:17.43]Actually trash.
[488:20.34]Alright, let's do, uh, Shower.
[488:24.98]Shower Plumbing System.
[488:26.24]What?
[488:28.42]What is this?
[488:28.80]Oh, we have to ins- Oh!
[488:39.96]Do you remember when I was talking about this game?
[488:43.85]And how I said that I really wish that it wasn't- Everything was pre-installed.
[488:46.93]Everything.
[488:48.35]This was like a year ago when we played this last.
[488:53.42]You couldn't do that before.
[488:55.94]Now you can.
[488:57.52]So that's good.
[488:59.95]You can actually place the shower where you want to, not where they deem it necessary.
[489:06.65]That's cool.
[489:07.93]That's a good change.
[489:22.26]A lot of sauce on this one.
[489:23.31]No, I'm talking about on my pasta.
[489:44.48]That's a saucy one.
[489:52.43]I don't have the right flash against the wall?
[489:56.13]Oh.
[489:56.93]Yeah, it's alright though.
[489:58.07]It's okay.
[490:05.00]In case water gets back there and mold gets back there, you can throw a towel back and drag it.
[490:10.76]Get all the mold.
[490:17.31]Beautiful.
[490:22.70]Uh, toilet.
[490:31.86]This game saves all the time, though.
[490:36.43]Hmm.
[490:46.17]Ooh, this is nice.
[490:55.04]I need a mount.
[490:55.58]I need a mount for the sink.
[491:11.47]Where's the mount for the sink?
[491:23.55]Where's the...
[491:31.41]Right there.
[491:36.37]Okay.
[491:37.91]Now we can get that cool sink.
[491:43.61]What was it down here?
[491:45.88]Yeah, this one's nice.
[491:48.30]No, no, that's not the one.
[491:50.62]Which one was it?
[491:51.84]Here it is.
[491:54.84]I like this.
[491:57.81]It's got a weird bowl.
[491:58.61]I like it.
[492:04.61]Yeah, this is kind of a restaurant bathroom.
[492:06.55]It's true.
[492:08.87]That's alright.
[492:09.37]Restaurant bathrooms are fucking awesome.
[492:12.63]What do you mean?
[492:30.21]Incorrect?
[492:31.57]A nice restaurant's bathroom is really, really awesome.
[492:36.58]When they have these cool sinks all over the place.
[492:40.12]You don't think that nice restaurants' bathrooms... I'm not talking about a Burger King.
[493:16.21]Toilet.
[493:22.94]Flatty or standard?
[493:28.48]I'll go with flatty.
[493:35.72]Two toilets, two toilets.
[493:37.36]Yeah.
[493:39.54]You guys don't like that?
[493:41.12]I mean, you guys use the same toilet every day?
[493:45.07]I usually use a different toilet every other day.
[493:49.61]Keep the other one clean.
[493:56.20]I would have a toilet for every day of the week if I could.
[494:04.93]Alright, bathroom.
[494:05.69]Let's get some stuff in here.
[494:07.47]One for each cheek.
[494:10.03]If that were the case, then you would just go right down the middle.
[494:19.67]If these were right next to each other, you would just go straight down.
[494:27.68]Millionaires just buy a new mansion when theirs get dirty.
[494:29.74]You don't have to be a millionaire to have two toilets in the same bathroom.
[495:01.24]Why does this stink so much?
[495:02.90]It's a sink.
[495:03.64]Okay.
[495:54.60]But when I heard the word restaurant bathroom, then I got thinking, this house sucks.
[496:00.42]And there's no, there's no room for another bathroom.
[496:06.85]Upstairs, there's not gonna, there's a, it's bedroom, bedrooms.
[496:33.52]I have a toilet to the kitchen.
[496:40.09]The possibilities do open themselves up though.
[496:43.85]I have a toilet as each seat at the dining room table.
[496:47.72]I think that's a good idea.
[496:58.93]That looks good.
[497:02.94]There's no mirror.
[497:18.86]Only one person gets a mirror.
[497:21.30]Actually, you can have one too.
[497:28.78]You just get to look out the window.
[497:35.36]Okay, so this is the bathroom.
[497:37.10]The two stalls and the shower.
[497:40.92]This person doesn't have very much privacy on this side, but... You're okay.
[497:51.60]Alright, so now let's get the dining room table set up.
[498:55.01]A little too far.
[498:55.91]Right here.
[499:02.85]End of the stream joke.
[499:05.52]This is the end.
[499:06.30]It's the end of the stream.
[499:09.38]I should have bought a table first.
[499:20.14]Hey, Lorsh!
[499:24.23]We should put Torla to the dining room.
[499:27.71]Oh, I'm a freaking genius.
[499:31.25]Oh, my fucking God.
[499:35.67]That was fucking hilarious.
[499:42.18]This is a nine.
[499:42.86]Yeah, we're going on eight and a half hours here.
[499:44.78]This is a long one.
[499:46.60]This is a long...
[499:53.19]Stop going through with it!
[499:54.49]It's too late now.
[499:56.77]Look, I can easily just point a money gun at this and turn it off.
[499:59.64]Let's go with black.
[500:28.71]Now it's a torture house.
[500:30.15]How why would it be a torture house now?
[500:34.12]Okay
[501:01.53]These are all the couches that are in the game?
[501:02.97]This is that.
[501:24.14]This is a big couch.
[501:25.14]I don't think it was that big.
[501:31.50]Okay, let's get, um... Sorry, let's get a bookcase.
[501:46.12]Uh, this one here.
[501:52.07]Just to, you know, brighten it up a little bit.
[501:56.27]A bag and a painting.
[502:04.18]Hmm, what do you think?
[502:05.58]What's a good painting?
[502:06.40]What do you guys like?
[502:15.09]Which one?
[502:24.09]The pink trees?
[502:26.60]Yeah, I agree.
[502:36.57]Look at this little place.
[502:37.59]Mm-hmm.
[502:53.64]Mm-hmm.
[503:01.71]Fridge?
[503:03.91]What is this?
[503:09.07]Oh, I thought this was a walk-in fridge.
[503:10.71]I was like, what the fuck?
[503:11.37]That would be awesome.
[503:24.92]Oh, there's the red fridge.
[503:27.30]Somebody wanted this really bad.
[503:30.50]Now you got it.
[503:34.10]Stove.
[503:52.88]Alright, you need to have, alright.
[503:54.56]I forgot.
[503:59.12]That's an old stove.
[504:01.04]Stanley fan?
[504:03.56]Nice!
[504:04.50]Looking good!
[504:09.45]Yeah, I'm gonna put it on the counter.
[504:12.23]I'm gonna sink.
[504:21.28]LOL, that was funny.
[504:22.92]Alright, let's get a counter.
[504:29.32]What the fuck is this?
[504:31.14]What the fuck is this?
[504:40.99]Get it up there.
[504:47.85]YES!
[505:04.27]Wow.
[505:04.69]I need, like, a little ladder.
[505:14.68]And I have an outdoor deck here.
[505:16.04]Alright, let me get some of the... Hold on, some furniture.
[505:22.08]Like, a chair, couch.
[505:24.00]A couple of these things.
[505:26.62]These things are interesting, I guess, right?
[505:29.26]Yeah, some of these.
[505:37.49]Get a few of them.
[505:53.48]This is a sick, like, recreation pool room.
[505:55.56]Hold on.
[505:56.06]And a gymnasium.
[505:58.46]Gym shit.
[506:00.92]Cross trainer.
[506:01.52]That's fine like that.
[506:10.14]I can't put this inside.
[506:13.90]Outdoor gym.
[506:22.95]Okay, I need a bed.
[506:25.27]Uh, this is not like the big pool room.
[506:30.81]And I'm painting up here like lightning electric rain...
[506:42.98]Spring grass.
[506:47.26]Can the bed go on the balcony?
[506:48.32]I don't think I can put inside things outside and outside things inside.
[506:51.24]Hmm.
[507:12.36]Done.
[507:13.47]Got it.
[507:23.53]Stop chewing.
[507:24.11]I'm sorry.
[507:24.67]I'm sorry.
[507:25.15]I'm trying to discreetly do it without anybody hearing me.
[507:27.09]That doesn't look right.
[507:42.65]That's glitched, oh well.
[507:45.12]I'm just painting over cinder blocks.
[507:54.38]Kind of.
[507:55.44]Kind of, yes.
[507:57.28]That is true.
[507:58.42]Okay.
[508:12.97]No drywall?
[508:13.83]That's not really in the game.
[508:18.05]You just pick what you want and do it.
[508:20.51]I actually like that color.
[508:28.97]This is a nice pool color.
[508:37.14]Why does the paint make that noise?
[508:38.54]It's actually very accurate.
[508:45.79]It is shockingly accurate to what it sounds like.
[508:47.63]Alright, get those paint cans.
[509:09.28]We're getting close.
[509:11.46]Maybe like another 20, 30 minutes and we're gonna be ready for the tour.
[509:15.21]And then I wanna compare, I wanna watch a clip.
[509:17.33]I'm gonna walk the same path that I walked in the clip.
[509:21.41]Do we have a clip of when I did it?
[509:22.41]I wanna watch it and then walk the same path.
[509:25.60]I wanna put it on screen and do it at the same time.
[509:45.35]Almost empty.
[509:49.27]He's gonna react.
[509:51.71]Yeah, I'm gonna react to my own clip.
[509:57.44]Kind of a weird spot.
[510:00.30]I like the pool room.
[510:18.44]It's a $12,000 pool.
[510:22.56]Seriously, if I don't get $600,000 or $700,000 for this house, I'm going to be pretty upset.
[510:36.12]It's doing that thing again.
[510:37.10]Uh-oh.
[510:42.85]I think we're doing too many assets in the game.
[510:46.57]It's starting to freak out.
[510:53.91]I have like 150 assets outside.
[510:55.75]I might be slowing the engine down.
[511:21.60]I just saw the Family Guy clip from earlier, and wow.
[511:24.27]Wait, what do you mean?
[511:24.79]Why are you seeing that?
[511:28.01]Who is linking that to you?
[511:40.21]You guys already sharing that?
[511:46.14]That's a lot!
[512:20.22]People will be mad if I miss these.
[512:22.94]It's happened before.
[512:23.64]Alright.
[512:31.57]One more wall and that's it.
[512:33.63]And then I gotta put a bed downstairs.
[512:49.03]I'm already mad.
[512:50.05]Why are you... Why?
[512:53.81]My clip has 66 views.
[512:55.33]Yeah, but I was doing like a dumb, ironic, stupid, like, look at my Peter Griffin.
[513:04.01]I know how to do Peter Griffin.
[513:06.77]That's not my actual Peter Griffin.
[513:10.74]That's not fair.
[513:18.37]Ironic.
[513:19.71]That was being ironic.
[513:28.38]The new slap.
[513:31.32]Hey, you don't think that shit's intentional?
[513:34.32]Now I got some embarrassing fucking thing that you guys are all sharing.
[513:37.92]No one's talking about the slap anymore.
[513:40.78]Pretty good tactic, don't you think?
[514:04.10]Alright.
[514:05.48]Our pool room is done.
[514:06.44]Just need a bed.
[514:11.40]And the floor needs to be done.
[514:14.40]It's got to be tile up here.
[514:16.00]If it's a pool, it's got to be like that pool tile.
[514:19.94]Like this stuff.
[514:21.38]Right here.
[514:30.55]It's not floor tile.
[514:31.59]God damn it.
[514:32.89]I thought it was floor.
[514:36.49]Floor tile.
[514:39.25]This one looks kind of like a pool.
[514:50.68]No, that kind of sucks.
[514:53.96]This one?
[514:58.64]Mmm, a little bit better.
[515:00.96]No, it's got to be white.
[515:04.07]Just classic white.
[515:05.95]White tile.
[515:06.59]That's better.
[515:12.45]I need to have stairs.
[515:26.65]Yeah, I'll put stairs in the pool.
[515:29.01]So we can get up and get out.
[515:36.20]How much is this costing?
[515:37.80]A lot of money, actually.
[515:53.85]Why do you have a YMCA in your house?
[516:03.41]Why not?
[516:13.56]Almost done.
[516:15.83]Kind of awkward because I can't really reach in here.
[516:18.77]Over here.
[516:26.86]I'm no longer worth half a million.
[516:28.56]I will be very soon.
[516:30.10]Once I sell this place.
[516:30.92]Alright, I can't paint this because it is glitched out, but here we go.
[516:36.33]Nice little pool.
[516:43.13]Let's actually put this in a different spot.
[516:50.73]And more room over here.
[516:51.57]Are we doing the same house?
[516:59.96]Yeah, we've been on the same house for just about nine hours.
[517:04.34]I've spent what some would consider an entire day on this house.
[517:11.52]An entire day.
[517:12.36]A whole day.
[517:22.68]I couldn't be happier with the outcome.
[517:36.15]What's the most expensive painting you have in the game?
[517:44.69]That's actually pretty cheap.
[518:00.63]Upload a photo.
[518:01.31]I did that last time and you can make it like 200 million dollars.
[518:20.46]I thought that was gonna be a lot bigger.
[518:34.98]Alright.
[518:38.20]No, we're not going out there yet.
[518:39.10]You can't see out there.
[518:43.88]Let's get some lights in here.
[518:52.13]Lamp.
[518:53.59]Go just like a standard cube lamp.
[518:56.67]This is fine.
[518:57.85]Make it like blue to match the room.
[519:03.84]Alright.
[519:04.24]Wait, I need the stove.
[519:05.32]Counter.
[519:11.38]No.
[519:18.12]I'm gonna have to do a second pull.
[519:23.06]Um... What's it even called?
[519:27.24]Furniture?
[519:27.94]Installations?
[519:30.87]Kitchen?
[519:31.63]What is it?
[519:33.29]Kitchen cabinet.
[519:33.85]Here we go.
[519:34.20]I was saying counter.
[519:40.16]That looks nice.
[519:46.02]Let's get a stove in here.
[519:50.51]Let's get two of these.
[519:57.07]Let's do three.
[520:01.16]Get the stove on there.
[520:11.38]Alright.
[520:14.36]Pretty cool!
[520:17.71]Wait.
[520:18.03]Why does it look odd?
[520:43.93]I already have a pizza oven.
[520:45.19]I don't need another one.
[520:50.06]Alright, let's get a light in here.
[520:54.06]Lamp.
[520:54.56]Sconce ball!
[520:55.40]Let's get a few of them right up here.
[521:01.05]These are ugly.
[521:01.83]These are very ugly, but it's okay.
[521:05.71]It is light.
[521:06.67]That's all that matters.
[521:10.60]I got a lamp there.
[521:11.52]Let's get uh, some recessed lighting up here, please.
[521:14.44]Thank you Got a tube
[521:40.56]There you go.
[521:42.56]This place is ugly as sin.
[522:12.78]Any lights in here?
[522:13.54]Yeah, there are.
[522:17.79]This is very ugly.
[522:20.59]It's very, very, very ugly.
[522:24.11]But, you know, we're at the end here.
[522:27.93]I'm kind of tired.
[522:32.24]So, are we gonna have a very ugly house?
[522:33.76]It's okay.
[522:37.76]It still looks alright.
[522:38.84]It still looks good.
[522:41.22]Alright, are we ready for the tour?
[522:56.28]It's time.
[523:01.10]And I want to do this at night, and I want to do this at dark.
[523:05.94]Reverse that.
[523:06.79]I want to, okay, I want to do this at night, I want to do this during the day.
[523:09.51]Don't look!
[523:09.89]Nobody look!
[523:10.27]Don't look at, nobody look.
[523:13.49]Okay.
[523:15.61]And I want it to be daytime.
[523:23.75]There's no lighting in the garden.
[523:25.25]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[523:27.58]Bed, bed, I need a bed.
[524:01.14]Come on.
[524:01.70]I need just a little thing.
[524:02.77]There we go.
[524:19.88]Perfect.
[524:20.36]Nice.
[524:21.02]Very nice.
[524:21.48]Okay.
[524:30.22]Wait, that door's open.
[524:41.84]Doors are closed, closed, closed, closed, closed.
[524:44.46]Closed, closed.
[524:45.50]Okay, here we go.
[524:56.40]Alright.
[524:58.44]Ladies and gentlemen.
[525:00.44]Thank you for joining us.
[525:02.44]I'm not going to play the Family Guy theme, no.
[525:09.87]There's the before clip.
[525:12.36]Let me see it.
[525:16.71]Oh, it looks like shit.
[525:19.29]I'm just gonna have this loop silently so you can understand what's going on here.
[525:27.17]Let me just get it on screen.
[525:43.15]Did anybody get any- I really do want, like, screenshots though.
[525:45.51]So I'm gonna put time into this.
[525:46.41]I'm gonna make this real.
[525:51.41]Alright.
[525:53.96]Here is the before.
[525:59.76]Take a look at this dump.
[526:04.50]Trash everywhere, boards.
[526:09.14]The whole thing was condemned.
[526:10.50]Weeds growing all over the place.
[526:11.70]It was uninhabitable.
[526:16.81]This is the front door right here.
[526:19.43]Dumpster.
[526:21.13]Over here on the right hand side.
[526:22.31]You've got just dead grass.
[526:26.70]Looks terrible.
[526:29.28]I was ashamed.
[526:32.60]But now.
[526:34.62]But now.
[526:38.53]I am no longer ashamed.
[526:41.77]Here's what we have here now.
[526:54.79]Let's take a walk to that right side where that dumpster was.
[526:56.75]Remember that dumpster?
[527:02.52]Now it is a stone walkway with a nice picnic area for you and your kids.
[527:10.81]All that trash, nice fresh grass.
[527:14.13]We have a windmill farm here.
[527:15.31]Another garden.
[527:21.04]Taking us to the right.
[527:22.50]Some more little, uh, flowers there.
[527:26.46]Fucking door was open.
[527:28.44]When I do my tours, you close all the goddamn doors.
[527:33.59]Through here we have the viewing area.
[527:35.61]This used to be with, you know, as you can see.
[527:38.13]Put it back on the screen just so you can see just how bad it was.
[527:43.25]Take a look at this right side here.
[527:45.12]Now there's a couch.
[527:46.02]Now there is a projector.
[527:47.20]Two pizza ovens.
[527:52.04]Looks a lot different, doesn't it?
[527:58.91]Looks much better.
[527:59.45]Yeah, there's an outdoor projection TV.
[528:07.33]Man, but look at this backyard!
[528:08.45]Look at where we are!
[528:11.70]Fresh green!
[528:13.44]Trees!
[528:14.70]An outdoor patio!
[528:19.38]A grill!
[528:22.10]A pool.
[528:22.50]A little kiddie pool.
[528:23.58]Completely redone.
[528:28.18]A fresh pond with our little friends here.
[528:32.28]And our little group of flowers over there.
[528:34.77]We got a little birdhouse.
[528:37.47]Small garden over here.
[528:39.95]Smoking area.
[528:41.03]For those of you that smoke.
[528:46.27]Only smoke out here, please.
[528:48.17]And nowhere else.
[528:50.78]Leading us out to the garage area.
[528:52.38]This is the driveway.
[528:54.57]Take a look at that.
[528:58.15]How do I turn the damn hut off?
[528:59.39]A little pond here.
[529:06.87]Hammock.
[529:11.42]I think it looks phenomenal.
[529:13.48]Fresh driveway, yeah?
[529:17.04]I'm like... No, I'm not crouching again.
[529:25.24]Can I go inside the garage?
[529:26.62]Yeah, just a second.
[529:56.84]Alright, in the garage we have... Nothing, actually.
[530:03.75]Because there was nothing built.
[530:06.21]There was something in there.
[530:10.21]Not letting the dog live inside.
[530:11.77]The dog does live inside.
[530:12.97]Never mind.
[530:16.83]No, what do I... No!
[530:18.33]Close this.
[530:19.25]Go back out.
[530:29.61]So let's take a look inside your new home.
[530:35.27]You don't have to knock here.
[530:37.37]You own the place.
[530:40.71]Come on in.
[530:43.31]This is yours.
[530:45.79]Close the door behind you.
[530:46.54]So don't get too much drafty in here.
[530:52.34]How's that to your left?
[531:01.41]Your space.
[531:03.98]Your area.
[531:08.00]Your... gaming lounge.
[531:14.86]You got three connections here.
[531:20.07]That seems like a lot of cable.
[531:21.79]For what?
[531:23.59]Pretty believable off- Believable is the word that comes out of my brain here.
[531:28.15]Pretty believable.
[531:35.51]Can we get a look at what it looked like inside?
[531:37.23]I don't think we have that.
[531:39.35]We can get that off the screen just so you can... You know, we don't need to see it anymore.
[531:46.27]Uh, if you're wondering, is this a joke?
[531:48.96]Well, the... No, it's not.
[531:51.18]There actually are toilet plumbing here.
[531:53.48]I just want to make sure I proved it to you.
[531:56.70]In case you just didn't believe me.
[531:59.12]Which, I don't know why you wouldn't.
[532:05.65]Hold on, just give me one minute.
[532:06.61]I gotta reinstall the toilet here.
[532:12.47]Uh, this is here for any Family Guy jokes that you'd like to make.
[532:17.41]Or if you want to be at the table and use the bathroom at the same time.
[532:20.26]It's very possible.
[532:23.60]Here's your kitchen area.
[532:25.48]You have, right here, this is a very interesting fridge.
[532:27.92]This is the fridge that one person over the last eight and a half, nine hours told me to put the red fridge in the game.
[532:34.82]Every 14 minutes.
[532:36.58]Did it finally.
[532:42.75]Up here you got your stove.
[532:46.89]And your three musical cabinets.
[532:54.51]Microwave?
[532:57.09]For those nights that you just don't feel like cooking.
[533:04.03]Is there no oven?
[533:05.01]No oven.
[533:07.05]Well, we passed the two pizza ovens.
[533:09.53]So.
[533:10.85]But the real treat is up the stairs.
[533:14.65]Careful now, slowly.
[533:18.23]Okay.
[533:20.31]Okay, you can take the blindfold off.
[533:21.71]Because up here...
[533:24.27]Oh, wait, no, fuck.
[533:25.67]No, no, no, come back downstairs.
[533:27.77]Come back downstairs, come back downstairs.
[533:29.83]All the way back outside.
[533:30.69]God damn it.
[533:32.33]Why do they have a fucking blindfold on you?
[533:37.51]Okay, take the blindfold off and look at what you see.
[533:40.84]Didn't it look nice?
[533:44.56]Look over on your... You know, just get back in here.
[533:48.18]Get back inside.
[533:48.78]Oh, God.
[533:50.38]Oh, God.
[533:52.27]They make these stupid ass shows.
[533:53.69]I just want to show the fucking house.
[533:56.95]Up here, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[533:58.27]It's a pool.
[533:59.24]It's a big pool up here.
[534:05.08]It's a nice pool.
[534:08.81]I forgot to put stairs on here.
[534:10.09]Hold on a second.
[534:11.35]Give me a minute.
[534:12.73]Pretty handy.
[534:27.13]Can't.
[534:41.28]Hey, you can have my handy letter.
[534:42.76]Alright.
[534:50.39]There you go.
[534:52.25]Some of the crew left it.
[534:54.95]Out here, you've got your whole entire zone.
[534:58.01]You can see it all.
[535:08.20]What about the front?
[535:08.84]Let's take a look at the front of the balcony.
[535:17.00]Oh, yeah.
[535:18.56]Don't jump.
[535:18.90]Don't jump.
[535:19.32]Don't jump off there.
[535:33.24]There's your house.
[535:36.66]Now let's see what it's worth.
[535:43.98]What is your house worth?
[535:53.89]American Crop English.
[535:56.29]Modern.
[536:09.93]I got five stars for the layout.
[536:11.49]I mean... Zero.
[536:14.97]You can't even get this on Yelp.
[536:19.18]That's not fair.
[536:26.28]And I picked the wrong category.
[536:27.58]Wrong category.
[536:28.40]Wrong.
[536:29.00]No, no.
[536:29.48]Do not re-participate in the garden competition.
[536:33.15]In ten minutes.
[536:57.68]Is it 10?
[536:58.16]It's 10 real life?
[537:00.46]What does this say?
[537:03.64]What is that?
[537:04.40]What does that say?
[537:05.47]Get good.
[537:07.55]I don't know what that says.
[537:23.76]Fix the wall?
[537:24.58]What wall?
[537:25.32]There's a lot to fix, man.
[537:26.50]There's a lot.
[537:27.02]It's more than just... It ain't just the wall.
[537:35.86]Add some plants for fuck's sake.
[537:37.40]Oh, I know that's you just messing around.
[537:45.25]So, uh, we're gonna do the bits.
[537:48.55]And I'm gonna try again.
[538:00.35]So, this is gonna be 10 hours.
[538:03.93]This might actually be, it's been a while since I've done 10 hours.
[538:13.00]Move the office here?
[538:13.78]I absolutely will move the office here.
[538:27.20]I had a perfect opportunity to do, like, a pretend Skype with Grandma, show her the house thing.
[538:33.25]Okay, you're walking up.
[538:34.21]You see Grandma?
[538:35.55]This is the neighborhood.
[538:37.35]Oh, wow, that looks great.
[538:40.61]What's that over there on the right side?
[538:43.82]Oh, here, here.
[538:45.46]I want to see that.
[538:49.50]Ooh.
[538:50.96]Are those real animals?
[538:53.55]No, Grandma, those are stone.
[538:55.66]They're made out of stones.
[538:57.60]Oh, that's very beautiful.
[538:59.08]That's absolutely beautiful.
[539:02.64]Come over here, Grandma.
[539:04.22]Okay.
[539:06.08]I'm not going to do this whole bit again.
[539:07.48]You get it.
[539:22.96]My friend did the virtual tour with this place before.
[539:25.42]It was annoying.
[539:26.10]Yeah.
[539:28.54]Hey, take a look around.
[539:29.98]I've got this room and that room.
[539:32.04]Alright, let's do the bits.
[539:35.84]I will see you guys later.
[539:42.18]What's today?
[539:42.50]Today's Friday.
[539:47.00]Can't sell it?
[539:49.11]You can sell it.
[539:52.73]I'll just move my office back to the dump, that's fine.
[539:56.75]Oh, it is currently Saturday.
[540:02.49]Friday Night House Flipper.
[540:03.95]No, no, no, no, no.
[540:07.81]Sell it now?
[540:08.57]But I want to do the garden thing again.
[540:09.69]I feel like I picked the wrong one.
[540:16.76]It's only like 10 minutes.
[540:17.60]We've been here for 9 hours.
[540:18.22]What's another 8 minutes?
[540:30.92]So what we'll probably do, because this one will take us to about 10 plus hours.
[540:38.05]I'll probably just, I'll probably take tomorrow off.
[540:41.33]And then we'll come back on Sunday.
[540:43.41]Technically, well, today is Saturday, technically.
[540:47.31]Right?
[540:48.61]So Saturday is technically now.
[540:53.35]So Sunday.
[540:54.73]So tomorrow, technically.
[540:57.77]Which is Sunday.
[540:58.27]Okay.
[541:09.89]Or maybe, I don't know, maybe not.
[541:11.09]Maybe... Maybe we'll just go tomorrow.
[541:15.87]Depends.
[541:16.47]Depends on what time I fall asleep and get up, you know?
[541:23.84]Let me see what's going on tomorrow morning.
[541:30.63]Come back in ten minutes.
[541:35.59]Yeah, we'll see.
[541:36.03]I mean, if I... If tomorrow I'm like, you know what?
[541:38.30]My energy's up.
[541:39.88]I'm good.
[541:42.14]I do have to plan around... I need to look at a calendar again, because this is gonna get weird.
[541:46.16]Because I have to take the end of this next week off.
[541:52.38]Because of my colonoscopy.
[541:58.14]One, two...
[542:00.67]Yeah, we'll see.
[542:01.21]Just keep an eye on the sus.
[542:06.89]So I have to move some things around.
[542:10.69]But there may or may not be a stream tomorrow.
[542:13.47]I'll just check the sus tomorrow afternoon.
[542:16.69]And if there is, if I stream tomorrow, then we're going to do a DOS.
[542:22.73]MS-DOS.
[542:24.45]Go back to DOS night.
[542:27.88]He was serious?
[542:28.46]Yeah, I gotta... I have a colonoscopy, yeah.
[542:32.43]The whole thing?
[542:32.91]They're doing the whole thing?
[542:38.67]How long has it been?
[542:45.94]Can I not do the garden thing yet?
[542:49.36]I think I have to just wait.
[542:51.40]Alright, I'm gonna mute this and we'll do the bits while we wait to do the garden one more time.
[542:55.45]I'm gonna pick the other one and then I'm gonna sell the house.
[543:03.69]Can't wait for the colonoscopy stream.
[543:04.97]That's not gonna happen.
[543:06.53]So if you want to see how much the house is gonna be worth, stick around for like another 20, 30 plus minutes or so.
[543:11.95]And that'll be the last thing I do before I turn off the stream.
[543:15.67]See you probably Saturday, Sunday, see you tomorrow at some point.
[543:20.67]Whenever that ends up being.
[543:25.52]Thanks for watching as always.
[543:26.92]Thankfully the internet was able to be stable for most of the stream.
[543:30.98]I'm very happy to hear that, so...
[543:33.56]Much love to you if you're taking off.
[543:35.79]If you're sticking around, we've got some bits to do.
[543:45.13]Earlier.
[543:47.01]Rewind the clock almost the whole day ago.
[543:51.27]We had four dolls from Noxy.
[543:54.53]Excited for Scare Saturday tomorrow.
[543:58.37]Unfortunately, there will not be a Scare Saturday tomorrow.
[544:02.15]Oh, fuck, the game is paused.
[544:03.53]Holy shit, thank you for saving me.
[544:11.68]Thank you for the $4 and no scare Saturday, sorry.
[544:15.36]StixRenegade, thanks for the $2.55.
[544:16.84]No matter where you are in life, even if you have nothing to your name, always get the two-ply toilet paper.
[544:23.49]Yeah, Charmin Ultrasoft is... I think you get that.
[544:27.39]It's like, get that or go home.
[544:31.39]That's the best one.
[544:34.32]It is good.
[544:35.24]You're alright.
[544:35.68]Yeah, but I wanted to make it look good.
[544:38.78]I got a little neurotic.
[544:39.54]I tend to do that, though.
[544:41.43]Ultra strong?
[544:42.13]I actually don't use ultra strong.
[544:43.31]I use ultra soft.
[545:05.25]Thank you, Juno.
[545:07.03]Thank you, Atrolux, Atrix for the 250.
[545:09.85]Without letting chat know I said this, ask them... Okay, well... Who would get this wrong?
[545:20.12]Watch the geniuses debate this.
[545:23.88]They'd ask, what is 2 plus 2?
[545:25.48]I mean, everyone would get that.
[545:31.19]Who would get that wrong?
[545:35.13]Not very many people.
[545:37.49]Uh, Ramblin' Jan, thanks for the five dollars.
[545:39.37]A house-sized pizza oven, as in a house-sized pizza.
[545:44.59]Um, yes, please.
[545:47.40]No, just regular pizzas, but a lot of them.
[545:50.52]At least, like, seven or eight could fit in there.
[545:56.06]But thank you for the five dollars, Ramblin' Jan.
[545:59.97]Smellyboy, thanks for the 250.
[546:01.01]Is this the streamer that turned House Flipper into Minecraft?
[546:04.25]Accidentally.
[546:05.19]But yes.
[546:07.23]It was on accident.
[546:11.70]The $115.
[546:12.18]It was 11,500 bits from Hayden.
[546:15.02]Clip fell.
[546:17.64]It was a lot of money.
[546:18.58]It was earlier.
[546:19.12]It was way earlier.
[546:20.96]I'm not even sure if it's still here, but that was a shitload of money.
[546:23.84]Thank you.
[546:25.70]For your huge bit drop there.
[546:30.89]Much appreciated.
[546:33.93]Also, thank you to InvaderZ21.
[546:38.99]Thanks for the five dolls.
[546:41.53]Hey, Jeremy, your videos always make me happy when I'm upset or have had a rough day at work.
[546:45.77]Thanks for helping me relax and have a laugh sometimes.
[546:47.83]Absolutely.
[546:50.85]Thank you for being part of the community.
[546:54.09]Thanks for thinking the videos and the streams are worth watching.
[546:58.43]Thanks.
[547:03.29]Glad they make you happy.
[547:06.11]Thank you for the $5.
[547:09.40]Thank you, Frodeon Weapon, for the $2.50.
[547:10.60]I've done a voice that sounds so similar to that one, it's scary.
[547:15.40]Talking about the Peter Griffin.
[547:17.10]The ironic Peter Griffin laugh that people thought I was... That clip's gonna get deleted.
[547:23.19]Thank you for the $2.50, though.
[547:24.01]Appreciate it, Frodeon.
[547:28.17]Firestar, thanks for the $10.
[547:29.71]Jerma, can you fix my parents' marriage?
[547:33.52]I cannot.
[547:34.82]I'm sorry.
[547:38.01]Complicated relationships.
[547:41.55]I can't help you there.
[547:42.85]I'm sorry.
[547:48.29]I'm just telling you the truth.
[547:54.48]We appreciate your honesty.
[547:55.58]I'm not a professional.
[547:58.08]I can't help.
[548:05.73]Awful streamer.
[548:11.49]Not a licensed therapist.
[548:15.21]No, but thank you, Firestar, for the $10.
[548:17.51]If serious, then I'm sorry that you're going through that right now.
[548:20.92]But if joke... Fucking laughing about it a little bit right now.
[548:26.32]Thank you for the $10.
[548:28.74]Hey, Wincerind.
[548:31.30]Thank you.
[548:38.60]Paint the top story a different color than the bottom.
[548:42.30]Yeah, people were saying that.
[548:44.54]Maybe I should have.
[548:46.46]Instead I made the Family Guy house.
[548:49.88]Like an idiot.
[548:54.24]But thank you.
[548:55.80]Dr. Low Note had 10 community subs earlier.
[548:59.76]Thanks for the drop of 10.
[549:00.54]A lot of subs.
[549:07.20]Thank you, Dr. Low Note.
[549:08.96]No, I'm not gonna do any one of those.
[549:10.10]Thank you for the $2.50, and I'm happy to give you the Family Guy strength.
[549:40.68]Thanks for the 250.
[549:43.90]No, I'm not doing Family Guy voices.
[549:45.37]Those get me in trouble.
[549:49.11]Even when I'm doing them ironically.
[549:51.63]They get me in trouble.
[549:54.65]Thank you, HaveGun, for the 350.
[549:55.65]Hey, Jerma, I graduated from law school last Sunday, and your streams in Second Jerma have helped me keep me mentally stable for the last three years.
[550:04.03]Your unique brand of comedy and insight has helped me stay free of depression and has encouraged me to do well.
[550:10.30]I now go to face the bar exam in two months.
[550:15.18]Thank you, Jerma, for being the great guy that you are.
[550:18.70]There are lawyers who watch.
[550:19.90]I'm telling you.
[550:20.50]A lot of smart people watch this stream.
[550:27.24]Lawyers, doctors, scientists.
[550:33.25]Good luck.
[550:37.99]Seems like you've been working real hard to get where you are now.
[550:42.17]So hopefully you ace it.
[550:46.23]And good luck in the future there.
[550:47.61]That's a really, really promising career.
[550:52.02]Thank you so much for the 350.
[550:52.84]70 IQ chat is a bunch of lawyers.
[551:06.70]We better get the colonoscopy stream.
[551:08.38]I can't do a colonoscopy stream.
[551:09.98]I'll get banned from Twitch.
[551:13.67]Flimflam gave $30 earlier.
[551:18.09]Thanks for the 3,000 bits.
[551:20.13]$30.
[551:23.91]Really appreciate that.
[551:24.63]They say, hey.
[551:25.80]Oh, hey, Jim.
[551:27.56]Hope you're doing well.
[551:28.76]My birthday's coming up, and my wish is for you to try a wine I like.
[551:33.65]Oh, absolutely.
[551:34.25]It's called 19 Crimes.
[551:36.71]It's a red blend, mild flavor, and smoother than your voice's bounded... Bounced off a baby seal.
[551:44.74]Oh, I thought... Red blend, mild flavor, smoother than your voice, bounced off a baby seal made of silk.
[551:51.94]Also, love you.
[551:55.24]19 Crimes.
[551:56.18]I will buy it immediately.
[551:59.96]The next time I find myself... I mean, we usually go to the liquor store...
[552:04.71]Is it widely available or is it something I have to get specially ordered online or something?
[552:14.04]Because maybe once every few months we'll go to the liquor store and stock up on stuff.
[552:24.07]I see it everywhere.
[552:24.95]Alright, 19 crimes.
[552:25.83]Red Blend.
[552:27.95]I love Red Blend.
[552:28.67]It's my favorite.
[552:29.99]Red Blend and Malbec.
[552:31.03]Malbec.
[552:32.85]are my two favorite wines.
[552:35.53]Malbec, probably a little bit more than a red blend, but Malbec is also something you don't drink.
[552:40.94]Like, just sitting here streaming.
[552:43.34]You drink it, like, at dinner.
[552:46.78]It's common.
[552:47.28]Alright, yeah, I'll definitely try it.
[552:53.85]That will be the next wine that I buy.
[552:56.09]I promise.
[553:00.19]Hell yeah, thanks for the $30.
[553:02.53]And happy upcoming birthday.
[553:06.75]That was Flim Flam.
[553:07.59]Thanks for the $30.
[553:11.86]What was that whiskey that you like?
[553:14.64]Blue?
[553:15.08]Yeah, Johnny Walker Blue.
[553:19.26]If you like scotch, Johnny Walker Blue is my favorite, essentially.
[553:28.27]I just like it.
[553:31.00]I mean, I don't drink it all the time.
[553:34.46]My Boomer dad drinks that.
[553:38.65]Johnny Walker is... There's like four or five different kinds of Johnny Walker.
[553:46.19]I would definitely say Johnny Walker Blue is my favorite.
[553:53.02]Yeah, how is Johnny Walker Boomer?
[553:56.10]No, like Crown Royal is Boomer.
[554:00.22]I know they're different, but like, when I think of like a whiskey, like a boomer whiskey, I got a Crown Royal and ice.
[554:11.03]I love Crown Royal and I'm young.
[554:12.47]See?
[554:13.89]What did we learn today?
[554:15.89]We learned that these assumptions are meaningless.
[554:29.72]Fireball.
[554:30.78]Oh, no, no.
[554:31.96]I can't do fireball.
[554:34.11]It's just like... I mean, I can, but I just don't... I did not sell the house yet.
[554:41.13]Only a little bit longer to go.
[554:48.20]But thank you, Flynn Flam.
[554:48.96]Happy birthday.
[554:51.01]Zaux, thank you, Zaux, for the $5.
[554:52.39]Hey, just graduated high school today.
[554:54.57]Thought I'd give back for the years of entertainment.
[554:56.21]Take care, Jeremy.
[554:56.89]Thank you.
[554:58.17]Congratulations on graduating high school.
[555:00.21]That's a big step in your life.
[555:02.97]Time to turn the page.
[555:05.37]I wish you the best of luck.
[555:06.93]Congratulations on graduating high school.
[555:10.83]Thank you for your $5.
[555:16.02]How do you know that?
[555:17.88]Did he announce himself as that?
[555:19.14]Was he wearing the same clothes?
[555:21.24]Did he have like a bag on his head?
[555:22.51]Who is it?
[555:22.81]How do you know?
[555:53.76]Hey, Silverflame, thanks for the $2.50.
[555:56.46]Jerma, I'm really drunk right now and I can't stop eating toast.
[556:01.92]Don't eat too much of it.
[556:05.50]Toast is good, but you don't want to eat too much bread.
[556:09.85]But I just want to say that you are a funny man.
[556:13.35]To be deep for a moment, you helped mold my sense of comedy.
[556:17.61]You're a great dude and I'll watch you until the day you somehow get yourself banned from Twitch.
[556:22.36]Kind of...
[556:24.86]Good luck with the colon surgery.
[556:27.12]You're in my thoughts.
[556:28.78]Anyways, I'm going to tell that girl that I mentioned yesterday that I'm interested in a relationship.
[556:34.66]Wish me luck.
[556:35.28]Or don't.
[556:35.74]You'll always be my true love.
[556:37.26]But... And it ends.
[556:45.91]But what happens?
[556:47.23]What happened next?
[556:48.41]I need to know.
[556:49.07]What's the next part?
[556:50.79]What happened after that?
[556:53.74]That's a cliffhanger.
[556:58.00]Thank you, Silverflame, for the 250.
[556:59.30]I'm honored to be somebody that you think is molding your sense of humor.
[557:12.49]I just hope that means a good thing.
[557:16.13]And I hope I don't get banned from Twitch.
[557:18.48]I don't plan on it.
[557:20.80]But thank you.
[557:23.41]Drink some water.
[557:33.05]We also had $10 from Vilemi.
[557:36.76]Vilemi, $10.
[557:37.78]Jerma, this yard is over-designed.
[557:40.24]I just... I was making like an amusement park.
[557:49.35]Thank you for the $10.
[557:49.83]I agree.
[557:52.61]But I think it still looks nice.
[557:53.61]0 out of 10.
[557:56.93]Not enough plants.
[558:04.48]Uh, thank you, The Jewish Bro, for the $3.
[558:06.80]Jeremy, you gotta see this.
[558:09.36]Um... I'm just... I'm sorry I don't click links.
[558:14.40]The only links that I click are very clear imgur.
[558:19.18]Reddit or YouTube links or clips.
[558:22.79]This is like an app.goo.Google with a bunch of weird letters.
[558:33.67]I have a very clear policy.
[558:35.35]That is not stated anywhere.
[558:36.85]That is not written anywhere.
[558:45.86]Google.
[558:47.10]Google.
[558:49.23]They just say, Jerma, you gotta see this.
[558:55.43]Why is it such a weird link?
[558:58.15]Images.app.goo.goo.
[559:01.84]Why is it such a weird link?
[559:05.06]It's a strange link.
[559:19.57]Paste it.
[559:20.18]I'll take the bullet.
[559:34.19]Don't do it!
[559:34.97]Don't!
[559:35.33]I don't understand.
[559:37.91]Sense danger.
[559:45.02]I know it's not malicious.
[559:46.14]I mean, it's... They've been around for a while.
[559:49.44]I just... I never like to click links that are not clear.
[559:55.63]Imgur, Reddit, or like YouTube links.
[559:59.87]I'm sorry.
[560:00.25]That's just the way it is.
[560:03.49]I'm sorry.
[560:05.61]Link shorteners can pull you.
[560:06.73]They just can't.
[560:23.44]Same, but I'm also desensitized by exposure.
[560:32.37]Yeah, but if we can get that in a... Like Dick?
[560:36.48]Okay, I'm... I'm just going to pretend I just said... My friend Dick.
[560:43.38]My friend Richard.
[560:44.88]He's a cool person.
[560:45.66]He's really nice.
[560:53.02]It's the picture of me kissing myself.
[560:55.18]Now I'm glad I didn't open it.
[561:01.79]And I'm chewing.
[561:02.87]I'm sorry.
[561:08.55]I've seen that image like a thousand times.
[561:33.73]Have you guys seen the... Speaking of Google and AI and robots, did you guys see the thing where they can now take a photo, even a photo from like the 1800s, and they can make it look like the person's moving around and talking?
[561:49.03]Have you seen that shit?
[561:52.78]We're going to get to a stage in the next ten, maybe five to ten years, where somebody will be able to make you do and say whatever they want.
[562:04.25]In ten years.
[562:14.38]We'll have such unbelievably good doctored footage.
[562:27.37]We already have that.
[562:28.95]Yeah.
[562:32.57]Somebody can just put your... Like, take an image of your face and with a computer... It's just wild.
[562:39.61]When I saw the... Somebody tweeted it or something.
[562:44.95]I looked at it and I said, well, this is... Our children's children will be making each other Fortnite dance even when they didn't want to.
[562:56.49]Can you imagine a world where I get tweeted at me?
[562:59.86]Me doing a Fortnite dance that I never did.
[563:03.20]And me being like, Fortnite, man!
[563:05.32]Cool Fortnite default dance!
[563:06.84]And I didn't do any of these things.
[563:12.31]Imagine if that was possible right now.
[563:14.69]The agony that I would have to go through.
[563:23.91]Oh shit, now they have the voice.
[563:26.44]I can be manipulated now.
[563:32.94]But, thank you to Honeychain for the $2.50.
[563:34.58]Can you tell the story about the time Star left an empty coffee cup in your hood?
[563:37.86]I don't think I've heard it from your perspective.
[563:39.37]You know what?
[563:40.81]I mean, this is one...
[563:42.83]It wasn't that big of a deal.
[563:43.89]We were at, like, a computer store, and we were walking around asking questions, and he put his empty coffee cup in the back of my hood, and I didn't know it was there.
[563:52.35]So, walking around, talking to employees of this place, and finally, after, like, I don't know, maybe, it was at least, like, 10 to 20 straight minutes or so, I don't know, maybe less than that, of me looking like a dickhead, I just have an empty coffee cup in my hood, and I'm, like, walking around, oh, can you show me, like, the i7-4770K, please?
[564:11.86]Oh, yeah, sure.
[564:12.36]Right this way, sir.
[564:13.14]They just... I had to... I walked in front of him at least a few times.
[564:17.13]I didn't know he put it in there.
[564:20.81]So eventually... I... He was laughing.
[564:25.75]Well, I don't know if somebody was looking at it or... I feel like it was there.
[564:29.95]I knew it was there.
[564:31.38]And I just grabbed it.
[564:32.20]We were with a bunch of, like, employees and a couple of managers because they had to get the key to open up the thing to get, like, the CPU processor or whatever, or a graphics card.
[564:41.14]And I just grabbed the coffee cup and I looked at him and I said, you're a fucking asshole.
[564:45.59]And then everybody stopped and... It was just like, whoa.
[564:51.15]And I was like, no, like, what...
[564:55.94]I just, I called him like a fucking asshole.
[564:57.92]I was like, oh, you're a fucking prick.
[565:00.03]It was something like that.
[565:05.79]No, like yeah, in a jacket, like in my hood.
[565:07.99]It was something.
[565:15.56]He's got a photographic memory.
[565:20.46]I mean, I remember a lot of things.
[565:25.63]And I don't know, he thought it was the funniest thing ever, because I shut the whole store out.
[565:30.85]I turned off all the manager's faces, like, went, like... Whoa, holy fuck.
[565:37.42]And, like, ten seconds later, we were fine.
[565:39.24]It was just like, oh, so what's the I-770?
[565:40.68]Oh, yeah, right here?
[565:41.82]Hey, that's crazy.
[565:48.48]I remember things, too.
[565:49.92]Can you believe it?
[565:50.62]We have a superpower.
[565:51.42]We already went over this.
[565:54.49]But thank you, HoneyChain.
[565:56.63]Vilemi, again, thanks for $10.
[566:01.41]Thank you, Vilemi.
[566:02.07]You did all that gardening while spy-crabbing.
[566:04.01]I can't believe I spent a majority of this stream crouched.
[566:12.18]That's unbelievable.
[566:15.34]It had to have been at least a few hours, at the very least.
[566:21.40]But thank you.
[566:23.33]Almost to the end of the bits.
[566:25.21]And then we'll do the garden contest, sell the house.
[566:27.79]While we run the credits.
[566:31.65]Uh, thank you, Cad.
[566:32.67]Cadbtv250.
[566:35.47]Honey, I think the real estate agent is stoned.
[566:42.68]Smelly boy, thanks for the 250.
[566:44.40]Dog woke me up because of storm.
[566:47.28]It's 3.15 AM and I guess I'll be here till like 5.
[566:51.34]Good morning, Jerm of pain.
[567:00.01]Honey, I shrunk the real estate agent.
[567:02.35]I'll give that one to you.
[567:06.03]You can have that one.
[567:11.68]But, uh, Storm, hopefully it's not too bad.
[567:15.40]Welcome, though.
[567:17.78]Thank you, smelly boy.
[567:22.91]I've always wondered if you guys, you like Star or Etalyx, call each other by your real names outside of the streams.
[567:29.20]It's actually kind of hard.
[567:30.94]It's kind of hard to do that.
[567:34.34]It's weird to explain that, but... I call... For instance, Orb.
[567:43.45]You guys know Incredible Orb, right?
[567:46.02]He was here for EDC.
[567:48.33]And we hung out.
[567:49.89]He's the person that I picked up from the airport.
[567:52.39]I think, did I say that?
[567:53.09]Or maybe I didn't.
[567:54.47]Because he's an old friend.
[567:56.07]We've known each other for a long time.
[567:58.21]But I don't, I call him Orb.
[567:59.65]It's just Orb.
[568:04.10]Hey, what's up, Orb?
[568:06.04]I call him, it's just, it's all I've known him as.
[568:18.41]My friends call each other by our online names.
[568:20.62]My sister and her husband too.
[568:22.06]It's not weird.
[568:22.72]Not that weird.
[568:25.96]It's almost like a nickname.
[568:32.33]It's a nickname that has been...
[568:35.51]It's almost like, you know in the Game of Thrones, like, oh, you're a bastard, but I can make you a... Like, you may be in the world of, like, Song of Ice and Fire, right?
[568:44.43]A king can make somebody... Oh, you're no longer like this person.
[568:49.49]I'm going to name you.
[568:50.65]You can be, like, named.
[568:56.71]Back in, like, the old, like, 1400s, you could be, like, named to have, like, your actual name.
[569:03.82]Instead of just be, you know, your online ID.
[569:07.27]This is a really bad analogy.
[569:08.29]I think I'm too tired to explain this.
[569:10.29]Because I... Here's what happened.
[569:11.45]I'll tell you exactly what just happened right there.
[569:13.13]So, I was just talking about... I didn't want to, like, go off into Game of Thrones.
[569:16.35]Because I was terrified that I didn't want to, like, have anybody say anything.
[569:18.95]Because, I mean, the show just ended.
[569:20.28]So, I started to talk about, like, a real... A really good analogy.
[569:23.86]But, like, I didn't want to talk about the show.
[569:25.72]So, then I was like... So, I don't want to talk about that.
[569:33.10]And then I kind of gave up.
[569:36.42]1400s is medieval times.
[569:42.15]So I didn't want to like have people talk about like, oh, Game of Thrones, let's talk about that.
[569:46.19]You know what I'm saying?
[569:50.35]Long story short, it's not like that weird, I don't think, to call somebody.
[569:55.17]People call me Jerma all the time.
[569:56.21]Even like personal friends of mine.
[569:57.77]But even before being online.
[570:00.83]Just Jerma.
[570:02.37]Jerma.
[570:04.28]Hey, what's up, Jerm?
[570:06.11]Like my father.
[570:06.83]My, like, parents call me that.
[570:09.97]Hey, Jerm.
[570:12.75]So, I mean, it's not a... Out of the ordinary thing, I don't think.
[570:16.03]Yeah, it's just a nickname.
[570:28.60]The infection is spreading.
[570:30.20]Alright, we only got a couple more.
[570:31.20]We got, uh...
[570:33.53]C.A.D.
[570:33.79]B.T.V.
[570:34.53]for the 250.
[570:35.19]I can't wait for the colonoscopy stream.
[570:36.61]Here's the working title.
[570:38.07]Down the Jerma Hole.
[570:39.31]You can have that one for free, kid.
[570:42.69]No, I'll get- I will get permabanned from Twitch if I stream my colonoscopy.
[570:50.96]And plus, I don't want to stream that.
[570:54.08]Because, like, what if there's, like, shit that I need to talk to the doctor about?
[570:58.30]What if there's stuff that's- what if, like, something happens?
[571:01.99]No, no, I don't want everyone to know that.
[571:03.97]That's like, no.
[571:09.73]Stream it on YouTube, then.
[571:11.03]No, I'm not streaming it at all.
[571:16.03]But thank you.
[571:17.91]Hey, 1914, thanks for the $5.01.
[571:20.11]The stream was amazing, as always.
[571:21.27]You never fail to make my day better.
[571:23.13]Even if this year has been the absolute worst.
[571:25.57]Thanks for everything, I really mean it.
[571:30.18]I'm sorry that you're having a bad year.
[571:32.98]Hopefully it turns around for you soon.
[571:37.87]Thanks for hanging out.
[571:38.87]I'm glad you think this is fun and entertaining and interesting.
[571:43.11]That means a lot to me.
[571:46.01]So, thank you for the $5.
[571:50.85]Hope shit turns around for you.
[571:51.77]I really do.
[571:58.05]But thank you.
[571:59.65]Thank you, Pear.
[572:01.13]Pear, Pear, for the $5.
[572:02.59]Could the colonoscopy stream be audio only so you don't get... I'm not doing a colonoscopy stream.
[572:15.83]You guys gotta get off this.
[572:16.89]I'm not doing a colonoscopy stream.
[572:21.70]Yeah, that's somehow worse.
[572:23.10]Yeah, it is.
[572:26.49]He won't let us into his life.
[572:28.21]Oh, God.
[572:29.69]Alright.
[572:30.51]And last but not least, Clueless Sniper for $2.50.
[572:32.99]Thank you.
[572:36.15]Thanks for the $2.50, Clueless Sniper.
[572:38.66]Right at the end here.
[572:40.90]So we're going to throw the credits on the screen while I sell the house into the garden one more time.
[572:45.34]And I will see you guys.
[572:48.22]It is 1 a.m.
[572:49.38]Pacific.
[572:50.46]We'll be out of here in about 10 minutes, probably.
[572:54.31]So... Keep an eye on the sus.
[572:56.74]I'm gonna get some sleep.
[572:58.58]And we... We may or may not... It's like a 70-30.
[573:03.76]Like 70% yes, we will.
[573:05.24]30% no.
[573:08.16]So, there probably will be a stream tomorrow.
[573:10.35]We'll just... Maybe it won't be as long.
[573:12.63]Because we've been going for like nine and a half, almost ten hours now.
[573:16.57]So let's do the garden contest.
[573:20.11]I'm still here.
[573:21.49]I did not pause the game, so...
[573:25.00]Uh, how do we do this?
[573:29.63]Change the tool.
[573:30.37]How do I sell the house?
[573:36.11]Oh no, the computer.
[573:40.42]Hold on, wait.
[573:54.97]What is this?
[573:57.64]Oh, we have to do this too.
[573:59.76]Hold on, let me... Where's my laptop?
[574:03.78]Make this the office.
[574:10.68]Oh, I forgot.
[574:11.12]This is what we did yesterday.
[574:12.26]Look at how... This is not that bad.
[574:15.06]I'm still learning.
[574:18.48]Look at this.
[574:19.58]I didn't quite figure out how to roll the turf out.
[574:26.68]Had a little problem here, too.
[574:28.02]A lot of real estate out here.
[574:36.23]Oh, shit, there's a mole.
[574:38.65]Not like it matters.
[574:40.63]Oh, here are the different ovens.
[574:41.99]This is the charcoal oven.
[574:46.33]I don't know.
[574:47.67]And then the wood fire oven.
[574:52.09]What was in the house?
[574:58.15]Oh yeah, this is the weird, cramped, weird PT house.
[575:00.77]I didn't like this at all.
[575:06.57]Yeah.
[575:07.69]Yeah, this place sucks.
[575:09.79]You'd have to knock down a few walls to make this place really any good.
[575:17.42]Alright, so let's go back and let's do the garden contest.
[575:24.34]So this one was $183,000.
[575:24.74]Let's go here.
[575:25.04]Okay, let's see.
[575:30.35]$183,000, $23,000 for renovation, and $31,000 for furniture.
[575:35.27]So $3,450.
[575:35.49]Yeah, so I spent a lot of money here.
[575:43.49]Yeah, that's what it looked like before.
[575:46.67]This was nine, almost nine plus straight hours doing this.
[575:49.21]I mean, maybe I could have done it faster, but we were just kind of having a good time, so.
[575:56.00]Alright.
[575:57.54]Here we go.
[576:01.81]So what should I do?
[576:04.27]I did modern.
[576:04.91]Should I do English?
[576:07.65]Crop?
[576:13.05]Let's get the credits on.
[576:13.93]These are all the new subs.
[576:17.60]Thank you, everybody.
[576:23.62]Let's get you down here while we run this.
[576:30.40]Everybody for subbing, you guys are fucking amazing, thank you.
[576:32.70]As always.
[576:37.46]Should it be American?
[576:39.82]There's no pools though.
[576:41.80]English?
[576:43.41]Oop.
[576:51.41]What equipment?
[576:54.69]What am I missing for equipment here?
[576:57.63]I'm going to sell it.
[576:58.25]I feel like, but should I, this took a long time.
[577:02.95]I want to be able to visit this house though.
[577:04.19]220 225.
[577:13.51]That's like nothing.
[577:18.57]11 grand.
[577:33.16]I made more money flipping the Home Alone house.
[577:37.94]No, I refuse.
[577:41.72]What?
[577:48.63]I'm keeping it.
[577:49.09]It's mine.
[578:05.39]Time to move in again.
[578:06.33]Alright, I'm sorry, but the pool alone is $12,000.
[578:11.25]Oh, there's one bed.
[578:19.26]That's why.
[578:20.34]Right.
[578:27.34]And you shit at the dinner table.
[578:28.72]Yeah, I mean, these things you're saying are not untrue.
[578:42.34]Getting the pool out of this house alone makes the price irrelevant.
[578:45.98]Yeah.
[578:49.04]Let's get this back up in the middle here.
[578:53.96]That's a good spot for it.
[579:01.74]Also, there's no toilet paper.
[579:03.50]Why do I have to provide the toilet paper to a new owner of a house?
[579:10.44]That's not a deal-breaker.
[579:12.64]Wait, they didn't have toilet paper on a roll in the bathroom?
[579:16.34]No, I don't think I want that house.
[579:22.83]Alright, guys.
[579:24.35]I'll see you later.
[579:26.13]Keep an eye on Sus.
[579:27.37]We'll see what we do tomorrow.
[579:30.05]If there's no stream tomorrow, then there'll be one on Sunday.
[579:34.09]We'll see.
[579:34.55]See how I feel in the morning.
[579:36.45]Take care.
[579:39.04]Have a great night.
[580:05.54]Thank you.
