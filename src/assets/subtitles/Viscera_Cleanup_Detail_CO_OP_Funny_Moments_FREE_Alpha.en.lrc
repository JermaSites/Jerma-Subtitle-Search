[00:07.86]Oh, damn it.
[00:08.54]My name is still like... He's joined the game.
[00:15.61]Why am I... why does it say I'm 22?
[00:16.83]I'm way older than that.
[00:21.01]You just get an age.
[00:22.47]You get assigned an age and a mop, and then you're put in this station.
[00:27.95]Look who it is.
[00:28.53]It's the engineer!
[00:31.16]Look how scary this looks.
[00:32.94]Dude, check out this new unlockable for the engineer.
[00:35.58]Like the dirty spaghetti mop.
[00:39.29]Alright, can you explain?
[00:40.21]I have no idea what's going on, so can you please explain it?
[00:42.51]Because I have absolutely no idea what's happening here.
[00:44.75]Alright, we are space janitors on just a random, generic, first-person shooter, like, corridor level.
[00:51.87]And what we see around us is the results of everyone being shot and exploded, and our job is to clean up the mess that that shooter has left behind in his wake.
[01:02.61]So we're the guys that clean up after all the FPS games?
[01:05.87]Yeah.
[01:06.57]Alright, well, let's go here.
[01:07.99]I got some wasted blood on the floor here.
[01:09.54]Alright, nice.
[01:10.50]You just sweep it up a little bit, you know, you just get all of the splotches gone, and eventually you're gonna run into a little bit of a difficulty, but we'll deal with that when we get there.
[01:20.16]How could this be difficult?
[01:21.60]Oh, you'll see.
[01:22.60]Oh, it gets really difficult.
[01:24.54]Oh, look at how bloody this thing is.
[01:26.46]It's like I dipped it in, like, a corpse.
[01:29.82]I dipped it in my secret ketchup sauce.
[01:32.43]I dipped it in my, like, floppy toothbrush.
[01:34.38]Alright, so what do we do?
[01:35.30]Do we, like, open up a door?
[01:36.84]We break some stuff?
[01:38.36]Well, we gotta... You see all, like, the gibbets on the ground?
[01:40.69]We've got, like, a bunch of arm pieces and, uh... Why are they... Why is it appearing?
[01:45.94]What's going on?
[01:48.36]Why is it reappearing?
[01:49.10]You're making a mess.
[01:50.40]Why am I doing that?
[01:51.36]You're spreading all the blood around.
[01:53.66]How do I mop it up?
[01:56.42]You gotta, like, clean your mop, you know?
[01:58.48]We're space janitors, so sometimes you gotta get a little bucket of water and place the bucket of water down, and we gotta, like, rinse the mop out, you know what I'm saying?
[02:08.74]This is the stupidest game I've ever played.
[02:12.20]Hold on.
[02:13.07]We missed a couple spots over here.
[02:14.23]Yeah, you spread it around a little bit.
[02:15.47]But we've also got some bloody gibbets over here that we have to deal with as well.
[02:20.01]So we've got to find a disposal can.
[02:23.31]Hold on.
[02:23.73]I've got to dip my... You're standing on top of it.
[02:30.37]Is this really the whole game?
[02:32.77]We have to clock out after we finish cleaning up everything.
[02:35.57]Oh, damn it!
[02:37.95]I right clicked and I knocked over the bucket.
[02:40.87]And all the blood came out.
[02:42.71]Okay, clean.
[02:43.77]Alright, where do we get the water?
[02:46.89]Over here?
[02:48.45]So just refill it.
[02:49.45]What's the problem?
[02:50.15]How do you pick it up?
[02:51.33]Switch to your hands by pressing 2 or scroll wheel.
[02:58.43]I feel like I'm being groped.
[03:02.08]I'm trying to give you like an Indian sunburn.
[03:05.78]I'm wearing the fourth grade again.
[03:08.80]I pick it up like this, right?
[03:15.08]Yep.
[03:18.14]Why is this so hard difficult?
[03:20.98]Okay.
[03:22.00]There you go.
[03:22.80]Fill it up.
[03:24.62]It just like kicked the bucket all the way against the wall.
[03:26.70]What?
[03:27.38]Is that doing anything?
[03:28.44]Alright, I got the bucket.
[03:30.28]We gotta finish this work over here.
[03:36.40]These damn kids and their FPS games.
[03:40.35]Making me have to clean it up.
[03:45.21]Alright, well, let's keep going.
[03:46.93]There's a bunch of stuff over here.
[03:48.47]Alright, we gotta pick up the little pieces of gibbets and stuff.
[03:52.49]How do you pick those up?
[03:53.43]There's like some shotgun shells here as well.
[03:56.27]Can we have like a gun?
[03:57.15]Uh, these are just, these are expended cartridges.
[04:01.13]They've already been fired.
[04:02.29]We just gotta like pick up the little pieces and throw them away.
[04:04.46]Did you knock over both the buckets again?
[04:06.44]Maybe all three buckets.
[04:08.06]Oh my god.
[04:10.90]Well, let's go.
[04:11.96]Whoa, whoa!
[04:14.94]What does this one do?
[04:16.24]This one's like toxic waste.
[04:17.50]Yeah, biohazard.
[04:18.98]I think that's where all of the trash goes.
[04:22.42]I don't think you have to refill it.
[04:23.50]It just gives you a new one.
[04:25.74]Oh, it just gives you a new one?
[04:26.80]Alright.
[04:28.65]So how do we pick up the bits?
[04:32.69]Same way you pick up everything else.
[04:33.79]You just get the bit.
[04:36.17]Mmm, yum.
[04:36.73]You want to eat this?
[04:37.69]Mmm.
[04:39.37]Mmm.
[04:40.47]There you go.
[04:41.29]That goes in here.
[04:44.66]Just like, streak the blood.
[04:47.67]What are you doing?
[04:48.39]You're making a mess even worse than what we started with!
[04:54.53]Oh!
[04:55.12]Oh, that was broken.
[04:55.86]Alright, okay, let's move on.
[04:58.60]Alright.
[04:59.82]We got our space bucket of space water.
[05:02.78]Yeah, just carry that along with us.
[05:03.98]I'll be picking up some of these, uh, some of these shell casings.
[05:07.00]We gotta take the toxic waste bin with us as well.
[05:09.94]Is there any, like, graffiti that we have to, like, wipe up?
[05:11.88]I think there is graffiti, actually.
[05:13.72]Blood graffiti.
[05:16.14]Actually, let's take a little bit of exploration.
[05:17.74]Let's take a look around the space station and see all of the, what we have to clean up here.
[05:21.76]Like, what kind of mess we have.
[05:23.85]We got three pathways.
[05:25.01]Just take your pick.
[05:25.69]It's probably not a very big place.
[05:27.25]This is like an exploded person, so we need to like clean that up.
[05:30.39]There's like a torso.
[05:31.75]Nice job.
[05:33.53]Alright, clean that up.
[05:35.28]Now we just gotta pick up some of these pieces and put them in the biohazard.
[05:38.08]I got the chest piece.
[05:39.30]Mmm.
[05:39.56]Is this a worm?
[05:40.24]I got the rib cage.
[05:41.74]I got like an earthworm.
[05:51.00]It sucks to be a space janitor.
[05:53.02]This is a hard life.
[05:55.48]This is terrible.
[05:57.58]Nobody should... What did you do?
[05:59.76]Why did a worm... Why did this come out of here?
[06:05.06]Are you looking at this?
[06:06.72]The worm that's just laying there?
[06:08.26]This just like glided out and exploded on here.
[06:11.56]What?
[06:11.86]Do it again.
[06:14.68]There must have been a mistake in the slosh-o-matic.
[06:18.74]What, are we supposed to like burn some stuff?
[06:24.36]What do we do?
[06:24.84]Do we have to, like, throw some gibbets in the fire?
[06:27.18]I don't know.
[06:27.52]Maybe.
[06:27.64]Alright.
[06:28.00]That works.
[06:28.93]I got some kind of, like, leg.
[06:29.97]Are we supposed to be doing this right now?
[06:34.93]I feel like this is really, really bad.
[06:36.59]Oh, yeah.
[06:38.45]This body.
[06:38.99]Yeah, just burn it.
[06:39.79]Whatever.
[06:40.15]What?
[06:40.25]Stop throwing stuff at me.
[06:45.32]Alright, okay.
[06:45.94]Alright, okay.
[06:47.38]Put this box in here.
[06:49.30]Give me this.
[06:51.77]Put it in the fire.
[06:52.63]This bucket too, look at it, it's nice, it goes in the fire too.
[06:57.04]Oh, jeez.
[07:00.94]Yay.
[07:03.02]Why would it not put the... Are there any monsters?
[07:05.82]Are we gonna get attacked?
[07:07.06]I don't think so.
[07:08.38]I hope not, because that would be terrible.
[07:09.86]What, are we gonna mop them to death?
[07:12.07]We do have an attack animation.
[07:14.35]We do, we actually, we do have an attack animation.
[07:16.49]We do.
[07:17.33]We're definitely gonna be fighting stuff.
[07:21.38]Okay, you just scared the absolute crap out of me.
[07:26.31]Seriously, I thought you were all the way back here.
[07:29.55]We were just talking about monsters and stuff, and I was about to just start whacking.
[07:32.87]That was horrible.
