[00:28.58]I told you I was going to be early.
[00:31.14]I told you I was going to be early.
[00:35.76]I said.
[00:37.26]Check your feeds.
[00:39.68]Go check your feeds.
[00:40.40]That's what I said.
[00:40.98]How's it going?
[00:46.68]What's happening?
[00:55.23]I'm just chilling.
[00:58.28]How has 2025 treated you?
[00:59.44]Well, it's only been two days.
[01:04.41]Alright.
[01:14.77]I can't wait for this year to be over.
[01:17.59]Oh, no.
[01:21.14]What do you mean this year?
[01:22.78]You mean the last one?
[01:23.72]I was looking forward to the last one being over.
[01:29.85]2025 is going to be a good year.
[01:31.69]It's going to be a good year.
[01:33.64]Let's go in with optimism, okay?
[01:44.12]Did you see Squid Game yet?
[01:45.48]No, and I'm not going to.
[01:47.76]I'm just not going to.
[01:49.50]People keep asking, I get asked about these TV shows like every time I turn, okay, I stream like once every week or two now.
[01:56.93]And it seems like there's a new TV show to kind of pay attention to every time I turn my stream on.
[02:02.51]And I'm just going to assure all of you, I'm not going to watch any television.
[02:07.21]Any.
[02:08.45]So like if you think I might watch a TV show, no.
[02:12.46]No, it's like Seinfeld reruns on TBS.
[02:15.44]That's kind of what I do.
[02:21.54]Or streams.
[02:22.66]Or World of Warcraft streams, okay?
[02:24.69]Yeah, I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:26.23]2025, the year of honesty here.
[02:31.07]That's what I watch for my entertainment nowadays.
[02:41.03]You're an old fart.
[02:47.99]Yeah, I'm very aware of everything going on.
[02:50.47]You're talking about your TV show?
[02:56.15]My TV show has been the WoW Hardcore Only Fangs stuff.
[03:01.95]That's been my TV show.
[03:04.62]We've gotten such a great season so far.
[03:11.38]Same.
[03:14.09]It's been really fun to watch.
[03:15.69]I've been a big fan of a lot of that kind of content that can appear on multiple monitors.
[03:25.63]I like site-wide sort of events, right?
[03:29.55]I like events that have, oh look, there's like 20 different perspectives of this thing that's going on right now.
[03:36.03]I think that's really cool.
[03:37.69]I like kind of the interaction and the engagement that it does.
[03:41.55]when everybody's kind of on one thing because you get to see what this person's doing you get to see what they're doing oh my god they died oh my god what happened no I'm gonna see the clip a whole ecosystem is kind of formed around it and I think it's really really fun we left you in 2024. I don't care I don't give a fine leave me good
[04:14.58]Yeah, that's kind of the thesis of the House Flipper stuff, was try to get a bunch of people that are, oh, look, this person's doing it, this person's doing it.
[04:24.07]Just get a ton of, I want to call it like second, third, fourth monitor content.
[04:29.39]Not saying that you guys, hey, by the way, get this on your fifth monitor.
[04:34.19]But it's good second monitor stuff to jump around to a lot of people.
[04:38.87]That's true, yeah.
[05:10.20]Hey, you should come see the volcano in Iceland.
[05:12.82]There's going to be an eruption.
[05:16.50]I got some, I guess I, that's really awesome.
[05:19.42]That's really, really cool.
[05:20.24]But I found out a few things about myself.
[05:24.95]If a plane ride is longer than like six to eight hours, I probably will not go.
[05:30.65]I just won't.
[05:40.57]How far is that?
[05:43.81]Seven hours to Iceland?
[05:50.90]I mean, getting through half a season of a 45 minute long TV show, I think is my limit.
[05:57.38]Because when you get to episode seven of an hour long TV show on the plane, you start doing the thing where you don't even need to stretch.
[06:05.70]You just start like tilting your head from side to side and pushing your shoulders back and you just like
[06:11.22]Oh, I can't stand it.
[06:13.40]That happens at like hour four.
[06:20.68]You're so weak.
[06:22.55]I actually remember reading like a tweet or something one time about somebody was just like, Hey man, I don't know what the fuck's going on with this guy.
[06:28.51]He completely raw dog this whole flight.
[06:30.97]It was an eight hour flight.
[06:32.59]He literally had a cup of hot coffee in his hand and that's it.
[06:35.70]No TV, no nothing, no headphones.
[06:38.88]Uh, I remember it was like one of the funniest tweets or one of the funniest like little stories I've ever heard.
[06:50.94]When are you going to go to New York to do a New York stream?
[06:53.43]I don't do... I'm not doing any of that stuff.
[06:55.85]Why did I do that ever?
[06:58.87]Dude, what the... Hey, when are you going to do that New York City fucking Times Square stream?
[07:03.41]What?
[07:03.69]I'm not doing that.
[07:06.38]I am not doing that.
[07:07.42]I don't... I don't do that.
[07:14.86]You promised.
[07:15.58]I did not... When did I promise I was going to go to New York?
[07:26.81]What about Hawaii?
[07:27.65]Actually, I I would.
[07:29.11]How far is it from Hawaii from from LA?
[07:34.25]What's the LA to Hawaii flight?
[07:36.94]Is it like 4 or 5 hours, 3 hours?
[07:41.90]5 it's 8.
[07:43.04]I just know I'm I just won't go.
[07:49.18]That's too much.
[07:51.82]I really wanted to go, but it's 5.
[07:53.32]I said 6 hours and 6 hours and 10 minutes.
[07:55.24]I'm not going.
[08:01.56]Alright.
[08:02.40]Anyways, let's move on.
[08:03.16]Let's start talking about what's going to happen today.
[08:05.22]Uh, besides me reading somebody in chat, just saying, Hey, come to the state or country I live in and be going, well, you know, maybe one day I ain't going anywhere.
[08:21.33]I'm already there digitally.
[08:24.86]Hey, I'm already there digitally.
[08:27.32]Think about that.
[08:28.76]Hey, you want to blow your mind for a second?
[08:30.66]I've traveled the world already.
[08:33.24]I have traveled the entire world.
[08:35.88]I've been on a screen in probably every country.
[08:40.26]I have been digitally traveled into every major country, a major country on Earth, I think.
[08:46.69]Or at least continent.
[08:48.99]Every continent, I think.
[08:54.28]What an egomaniac.
[08:55.94]Oh, I have the data.
[08:57.56]I have the data.
[09:02.42]Did you ever finish Shadow of the Urge tree?
[09:04.86]I did and I thought it was wonderful.
[09:06.94]I did the thing where you just hold the shield up too.
[09:08.87]Oh, that was pre-Patcher Dan, by the way.
[09:15.15]But hope you're doing good.
[09:15.81]Happy New Year, obviously.
[09:17.65]Merry Christmas.
[09:18.25]You know, all the happy holidays, everything.
[09:22.98]Pretty low key for me.
[09:25.20]I just kind of did a whole lot of nothing.
[09:27.46]Me and Holly just sort of wanted to keep it a pretty low key Christmas and New Year's.
[09:33.47]I did hang out with Etalyx though.
[09:34.55]I did get to see Etalyx.
[09:35.61]That was good to see him.
[09:37.09]It's been a while since we'd hung out, so.
[09:39.39]And we spent some time together.
[09:42.39]Good to see him.
[09:49.53]How's Otto?
[09:50.65]Otto's doing good.
[09:52.07]Otto's doing good.
[09:55.64]He still is having problems, but I think it's just kind of permanent.
[10:03.17]He just has this long-term issue now that thankfully it seems to be completely under control, but he still sneezes and he still has a running nose sometimes.
[10:16.15]And they, I mean, they did a biopsy in his nose and they said that nothing really there.
[10:21.79]It just, it was kind of, uh, they said it was very weak.
[10:25.90]The tissue up there was like really weak.
[10:27.62]Apparently it was easy.
[10:28.64]I don't know.
[10:29.36]I'm just get kind of scared when you start hearing that.
[10:33.02]Oh, you know, it could be this, could be that, could be that, but he's doing fine now.
[10:36.44]And you know, that's what, that's all I'm going to say.
[10:39.21]right he's doing fine he's gotten a little older obviously he's turning 15 this year so he's an old dog um I'm just gonna enjoy the time that he has whatever it is hopefully it's a long time but that's all there is to it and I do I feel a lot better too so I know that a lot of you probably were wondering about that I've been kind of
[11:02.42]Been kind of sick.
[11:04.32]I'm always fucking sick, right?
[11:05.54]There's always something wrong with me.
[11:07.42]But this particular problem is whatever the hell it was.
[11:11.84]I don't even want to get into it.
[11:14.00]My stomach is feeling fine now.
[11:16.87]So I'm good.
[11:23.61]I do kind of have a cold though.
[11:25.09]So I do apologize if you hear a lake.
[11:29.31]I'm so sorry if you hear it.
[11:33.28]And then also I want to bring this up too because the last time I was live, I think, I haven't been live since the news kind of broke about this.
[11:41.81]I want to talk about the off-brand stuff.
[11:46.72]So if you don't know, off-brand has two different kind of, I guess, what do you call them there?
[11:57.74]There's two entities in the off-brand ecosystem.
[12:04.25]There's off-brand games and then there's off-brand studio.
[12:09.01]off-brand studio has closed so as of a couple weeks ago the studio has closed and it it sucks there was a lot of very very talented people that worked at this company I remember watching the creative team because that's the team I was on right I was chief creative officer which was you know we were
[12:31.95]kind of coming up with unpaid intern tasks and, uh, get to, got to work with Doug, Doug on shuffle mania, which was awesome.
[12:38.98]Uh, but I guess it just kind of didn't really work out and that's kind of where I'll leave it.
[12:44.78]Um, I do want to say that I'm not going to, I'm not getting, this is not a situation where it's like, okay, well back to the other schedule.
[12:54.21]Now I am going to stay exactly what I've communicated.
[12:59.90]There's going to be not a single change on my end here.
[13:04.30]I plan on streaming once or twice every week or two, maybe once a few times a month.
[13:09.74]Two to five times, maybe.
[13:10.90]I'm just not sure whenever I feel like it.
[13:13.74]It's not like, oh my God, I'm going to go back to streaming three, four, five times a week.
[13:17.76]No.
[13:21.20]But yeah, there was a lot of great people there.
[13:23.78]And I got to watch some really, really talented people.
[13:26.51]And we got to do a lot of cool things.
[13:30.27]Streamer Games was a lot of fun.
[13:33.07]I'd been working on the Streamer Games for almost a year.
[13:37.41]That went through three or four completely different iterations.
[13:40.05]It did a lot of kind of back and forth and making this change and doing this to it and maybe making this a little better or this.
[13:47.70]That was the last one that I really worked on.
[13:50.04]Because as of, I want to say like August of this past year, I kind of took a step back from the company anyways.
[13:56.66]All the bullshit that was going on kind of in my personal life.
[13:59.10]I was like, you know what?
[14:00.97]I'm just going to take a step back.
[14:02.81]So I already had been taking a step back when I heard about the closure.
[14:09.07]So for the transparency there.
[14:13.39]But anyways.
[14:16.31]Yeah, just going to 2025, a new year.
[14:19.82]Just going to see what happens here.
[14:20.86]I'm going to stream kind of lightly like I was always kind of planning on and just go from here.
[14:29.89]Did you see the candle that someone made?
[14:32.87]I've seen it.
[14:33.41]I've seen the candle.
[14:36.63]I've seen a couple of the things and I've really laughed very hard.
[14:39.25]Do you wear a toupee?
[14:45.27]I don't wear a toupee and I never will.
[14:52.29]No, we'll just go in full complete mad scientist haircut.
[14:55.32]Whoever gets there.
[15:07.69]Why am I like not talking?
[15:09.93]I'm just really curious how you guys feel about the toupee thing.
[15:13.83]Why am I, why have I not said anything?
[15:15.15]I'm just gonna sit, I'm just sitting here looking at the chat.
[15:17.15]I'm not even talking.
[15:17.87]I don't know, I'm like just, what am I doing?
[15:22.16]But yeah, 2025, let's go.
[15:24.10]I'm ready.
[15:25.62]I'm ready to do infomercial watchings.

[15:48.93]So here we go.
[15:50.43]Are you guys ready?

[16:14.31]Infinity Nikki.
[16:15.11]Is that the one?
[16:17.24]I'm not going to play it, but I said I was going to play it.
[16:22.00]I guess take that how you will.
[16:25.20]Alright, everybody.
[16:26.40]Welcome to 2025.
[16:26.88]Can you imagine being in a shittier place than this?

[17:31.09]Let me go like this.
[17:34.37]Okay, okay.
[17:38.77]Mm-hmm.
[17:42.23]Don't put a face cam on.
[17:43.56]I'm going to do it like once every like 30 minutes.
[17:46.24]Don't worry.
[17:47.26]I'm not a face cam streamer anymore.
[17:51.02]We don't do that hair anymore.
[17:51.98]Alright.
[17:53.40]You guys good?
[17:55.00]This one's called the pasta pot and it looks great so far because this lady is eating.
[18:00.49]This lady is eating raw pasta.
[18:03.43]I think this is raw pasta.
[18:06.73]At least that's what it looks like.
[18:09.01]Alright, let's go.
[18:09.47]You guys ready?
[18:09.87]How are we doing?
[18:10.43]You feeling good?

[18:16.51]Alright, here we go.
[18:18.35]Pasta pot.
[18:19.81]That pasta is too hard.
[18:21.71]That pasta is mushy.
[18:23.05]And look at that mess.
[18:24.43]It's all stuck together.
[18:25.61]Will you ever get it just right?
[18:27.83]Well, now you can.
[18:29.31]It's not okay.
[18:31.45]I don't want to pause it already.
[18:32.57]I'm going to pause it already.
[18:35.43]Pasta is not fucking hard to make.
[18:37.55]Okay, can I just tell everybody this?
[18:40.35]Pasta is the easiest food on Earth to do.
[18:44.24]It is easier than using a microwave.
[18:46.64]I am not even kidding.
[18:48.80]Pasta, cooking pasta on the stove is easier than using the microwave.
[18:55.91]So when you see shit like this, you kind of have to just ask,
[19:00.84]Well, first of all, this lady's eating pasta.
[19:02.90]This lady's eating pasta out of the box.
[19:05.24]Too hard.
[19:06.26]That pasta is mushy.
[19:07.58]And look at that mess.
[19:08.70]It's funny.
[19:09.16]Okay.
[19:10.12]I know I'm a pause Andy, but like the best part about this first one is why are you doing this?
[19:16.61]And she's like, she's grossed out by it too.

[20:58.61]There's nothing wrong with that.
[21:00.59]There's nothing wrong with this.
[21:02.56]Pasta that's been overdone is still fine.
[21:05.08]Or underdone.
[21:05.76]Just leave it for another minute.
[21:07.04]Why would you throw a... Just un... No butter, no... It's not like you fucked it up or anything.
[21:12.74]Why throw the whole thing away?

[21:18.75]I'd eat it out of the trash.
[21:19.79]There's nothing wrong with that.
[21:30.10]I know this is a Costanza moment here, but let me ask you a question.
[21:37.40]Where is it?
[21:41.91]Where was it?
[21:42.43]Where does he throw it away?
[21:47.13]Okay.
[21:48.05]Is the pasta that's right there, like right?
[21:51.29]Oh, you can't see my mouse.
[21:53.97]Is the pasta on the top there fine?
[22:00.03]Like the very top.
[22:02.71]No, and this is the Costanza conundrum, right?
[22:05.90]With the eclair.
[22:09.22]I wouldn't eat anything that goes in here.
[22:11.28]I am so weird about this.
[22:12.62]I would not touch this at all.
[22:15.82]Yeah, that was the pasta pot.
[22:17.06]I don't understand the timer thing inside of it, though.
[22:21.66]I don't get it.
[22:28.23]Like, you have to set it to a certain... Because it's, what, 7 to 11 minutes?
[22:34.18]Depends on the type of pasta.
[22:37.16]Bow ties are 11 minutes for al dente.

[22:46.88]I don't want spoilers, so let's see how this goes.
[22:50.59]Okay.
[22:51.31]This one's called the Farber Seal.
[22:55.61]How does this one work?
[22:57.97]Hey, no, don't pay attention to the 10 seconds.

[23:56.61]This thing probably sold tons.
[23:57.97]What about those sandwich bags?
[23:59.63]The ones with zippers cost much, much more.
[24:02.40]It's true.
[24:02.98]That's actually true.
[24:03.78]And here's another thing too.
[24:05.00]All of us that do this, you all do it.
[24:07.38]You can just pretend like you don't.
[24:08.34]It's fine.
[24:09.08]So you have like a thing of cereal and you have to be eating cereal.
[24:11.88]It's Cap'n Crunch or whatever.
[24:13.00]Let's say it's a bunch of devotes or Cheerios.
[24:16.29]And when you're done, you just take the bag, you open, you put one hand in
[24:20.51]And you just grab as much material of that plastic bag as possible without even looking.
[24:26.11]And just push and like turn and pull with your wrist and push down and just push.
[24:32.79]And then you finally come up and close the top.
[24:35.97]So this is exactly for people like me.
[24:40.04]Well, nope.
[24:40.80]Okay.
[24:42.14]You don't do the grab and like push down bag and mush it around until it looks fine.
[24:48.54]And then you just cover it.
[24:52.24]Alright, hey, what do you do with your bread?
[24:54.30]We just saw the bread over here.
[24:55.14]What do you do with your bread?
[24:56.38]You take a couple pieces of bread out.
[24:58.28]You spin it.
[24:59.28]You spin it so it's like super taut.
[25:01.95]And then you take the spinned part and you put it underneath the rest of the bag and put that on the counter.
[25:15.52]You keep the bread tag.
[25:17.46]Yeah, that thing's a pain in the ass.
[25:19.26]I'm sorry.
[25:19.90]I have to be honest.

[40:53.34]Did they say technology at all?
[40:56.28]Did we get a d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d technology?
[40:59.27]No, actually we didn't.
[41:02.13]No, we didn't.
[41:04.20]They said engineering.
[41:06.02]Did they say engineering?
[41:08.10]And reusable.
[41:09.34]Retape works like transparent tape, but it's engineered with non-sticky divider tabs, so it's easy to apply.
[41:16.37]Oh, it's engineered.
[41:17.87]It's not technology.
[41:19.87]It's not re-tape technology.
[41:23.75]Hmm.
[41:24.61]Okay.
[41:26.52]Okay, fine.
[41:30.28]This is called the smart server, smart server, the smart server.
[41:37.45]If you have a dog or cat, you know they can make a real mess when they eat.
[41:41.63]That's because regular pet bowls slip, slide, and spill, so food and water end up everywhere.
[41:47.43]And you're constantly cleaning up the mess, not to mention stains on your floor and damage to your cabinets and walls.
[41:53.99]Well, not anymore, because now there's SmartServer, the ingenious skid-proof, slip-proof, spill-proof pet feeder that does what no other bowl can do to keep food and water neatly where they are.
[42:05.03]Hey, uh, go check under your bed too.
[42:06.68]I guarantee there's piss under it.
[42:08.78]Your dog's doing stuff like that.
[42:10.54]Uh, there's probably, there's probably like a piss under your bed.
[42:12.84]There's probably piss under your bed.
[42:15.52]That dog does not give a fuck about you.
[42:19.76]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[42:21.96]Somebody's angry.
[42:22.86]Wait, I need this whole thing again.
[42:23.84]I'll shut up.
[42:41.07]Did the cat puke into the wall?
[42:43.19]Okay.
[42:43.64]Did the cat finish eating, turn its body around, and shit into the wall?
[42:47.94]What are you feeding the cat?
[43:01.76]Anymore, because now there's SmartServer, the ingenious skid-proof, slip-proof, spill-proof pet feeder that does what no other bowl can do to keep food and water neatly where it belongs and eliminate the mess.
[43:14.34]Kick a regular bowl and you've got food and water everywhere.
[43:17.84]but put SmartServer to the kick test and not one piece of food or drop of water on your floor.
[43:23.18]Water fell from that.
[43:24.82]Water fell from that very clearly.
[43:27.24]Come on.
[43:27.52]We get it.
[43:27.86]We get it.
[43:28.22]It works.
[43:28.56]But put SmartServer to the kick test.
[43:36.07]That still proves that it works.
[43:37.05]So there's nothing to clean up.
[43:57.43]Put a regular bowl on the floor, and it attracts ants.
[44:00.19]But SmartServer keeps the food off the ground, so there are no bugs in your pet's food.
[44:04.60]But if you just let your cat eat the ants, it'll be fine.
[44:06.16]Remember, the elevated design is more comfortable for your pet and helps digestion.
[44:09.82]SmartServer comes in small and large for dogs, and the smaller size is perfect for your cat.
[44:15.83]Spill-free bowls don't prevent splashing.
[44:18.23]Skid-free bowls don't prevent spilling.

[67:23.98]I like to be connected to water.
[67:25.81]I'm a water sign.
[67:26.95]I don't know what's going on with them today.
[67:34.87]But no, but seriously, I dropped my phone in the bathtub and it made a kerplunk.
[67:39.22]I pulled the drain up and it was time to get out.
[67:41.90]And it was... And it was like I was searching through hay looking for something.
[67:48.18]I was like, no, no!
[67:50.02]Reaching, grabbing, but I somehow couldn't grab it in one second.
[67:53.73]You grab it and you let it go.
[67:54.91]You grab it, you let it go.
[67:55.71]It was underwater for at least two full seconds, I would say.
[67:58.23]Like one, two, it's out.
[68:01.71]And the phone is still here and it works perfectly fine.
[68:07.06]It works perfect.

[68:59.54]Okay, the cordless, the 360 cordless spinner vac.
[69:02.60]I was, I was looking for a couple of vacuum cleaner ones.
[69:05.54]It looks pretty, whoa.
[69:25.38]Has vacuuming replaced your workout?
[69:27.94]The lugging, the tugging, and the plugging all over your home.
[69:31.66]Well, not anymore.
[69:32.89]Now there's Spinner Vac, the cordless lightweight vacuum that goes where no vacuum has gone before.

[69:40.82]for ultralight multi-direction maneuvering.
[69:43.32]Now you can deep clean the dirtiest carpets or glide right over hard surfaces with ease.
[69:48.60]The spinnerback picks up everything in its path.
[69:51.40]Big corded vacuums simply cannot fit under cabins or glide right over.
[69:55.35]Multi-direction glide technology for ultra.
[69:59.15]When do you guys think the ball bearing was invented?
[70:03.23]With 360 spin glide technology for ultra.
[70:07.05]Because this technology is pretty old.
[70:12.52]I mean, they didn't say what year the technology came out.
[70:16.03]They just said it's made with 360 spin glide technology.
[70:22.38]Back in 17... Back in the 1790s.
[70:29.89]Okay, I won't pause.
[70:31.03]Alright.
[70:31.90]Before, with 360 spin glide technology for ultralight multi-direction maneuvering.
[70:37.36]Now you can deep clean the dirtiest carpets or glide right over hard surfaces with ease.
[70:42.66]The spinnerback picks up everything in its path.
[70:45.46]Big corded vacuum simply cannot fit under couches, chairs, or...

[71:16.15]The secret is the body motion universal joint technology, which makes any turn of your wrist a matching turn of the vacuum.
[71:22.91]That was a different technology.
[71:25.04]That technology is the same technology, just it's a different technology way to say it.
[71:31.34]What was it called?
[71:31.98]Okay, the technology has upgraded.
[71:34.62]Because what was it called eight seconds ago?
[71:40.21]360 spin glide technology motion universal joint technology easing the secret is the body motion universal joint technology 360 spin glide technology for all so how would why this is the same technology they just okay

[72:14.51]Its whisper-quiet, powerful motor makes cleaning up after the path simple.
[72:18.68]Even the dreaded kitty litter comes up with ease with a wide-path nozzle that collects the large messes, the small messes, and even the fine dust and hair, all with no cords and no bulk.
[72:29.56]The Spinner Vac is feather-light, weighing in at less than 5 pounds, and is powered by this ultra-powerful, ultra-compact lithium-ion battery.
[72:38.15]There.
[72:39.19]technology baseboards are a breeze and the flex arm helps you reach anywhere with ease and when you're finished the one touch dirt tray seconds hair can clog vacuums and seize them up so you end up picking it out and it's a disgusting mess the spinner back has a simple one touch removal system so you can clean hair off your bristles in seconds and I mean that's no time that's needed on every
[73:04.07]in a world where interviewers often push their own agendas some Hollywood stars refuse to play along these are the moments where celebrities completely shut down loaded questions from reporters
[73:20.95]Dude, YouTube is so fucked up.
[73:24.35]Let's go over this.
[73:26.19]Let's talk about how fucked up everything really is.
[73:29.36]So let's talk about ads.
[73:31.20]This just reminded me of this.
[73:33.24]So anything on YouTube, we all know that there are ads.
[73:37.42]There are ads on Twitch.
[73:38.94]I don't run them in the middle of the stream, but you probably got a pre-roll.
[73:43.10]I don't really do anything about that.
[73:44.26]It just happens.
[73:45.48]Ads exist, fucking whatever.
[73:46.70]It's the world we live in.
[73:48.90]I'm going to give you my real problem with advertisements on these platforms, and it stems from something very interesting.
[73:55.02]It's this.
[73:56.48]When you are watching a video, when you... What do you... Alright, fucking wait a second.
[74:02.77]Let me just... Give me... Let me talk.
[74:05.89]When you are watching a video on YouTube, and let's say it's a lecture or something, let's say it's something that you want to learn about, it's okay.
[74:17.19]And then what you need to understand is when all of a sudden you do this theorem here, you've got x equals y, and then instantly, without the professor even knowing or understanding it happens,
[74:29.63]Here are the fucking M&Ms, and they are just talking to you.
[74:32.57]They are interrupting the lecture.
[74:34.19]They're interrupting the video.
[74:36.05]But the video does not know that.
[74:39.37]The video does not know that.
[74:41.46]Unless somebody puts ads specifically in certain places, deliberately to make sure this doesn't happen, you end up just getting fucking smoked in the face with something.
[74:52.76]And then we go back to normal.
[74:55.23]as in as if like the m Ms. like three of the three of them ran into the lecture hall screaming like by the m Ms. hey m Ms. they're in this new package hey dude there's green ones there's orange ones and the professor is just doesn't even care and then they've run out of the room they leave the door closes and he's and as yeah and to take that out you carry the two and after you do that you want to make sure pay attention to this this is very important it's like dude I
[75:24.37]A pizza company just was fucking showing me pizza in the middle of this.
[75:27.20]That's my problem with ads.
[75:31.36]I want a countdown.
[75:35.00]I want a ad incoming.
[75:36.83]Some places do this.
[75:38.29]I want an ad incoming in three, two, one, down in the corner.
[75:43.61]It's that simple.
[75:46.65]It's that simple.
[75:48.29]And ads are usually way louder than everything else.
[75:50.55]So not only are you sitting there just chilling, you're just kind of like, oh, wow, birds are... It's like, whoa, I'm just trying to watch something about birds.
[76:02.80]And then we go back to as if like, and the birds are just still hanging out.
[76:35.49]so yeah and then at the end of the day when you really break it down you really got to talk about it it's it's just it's I don't know it's fucking it's really sad it's it's super fucking sad and um
[76:55.81]I don't know.
[76:56.23]It just really pissed me off that I had to fucking see it and think about it.
[76:59.61]It's just fucking annoying.
[77:00.94]Hopefully we can start banning people for it.
[77:02.42]I got 18 more seconds.
[77:09.07]Is this way too early?
[77:21.84]So, and, and it's, it's, it's, it's frustrating.
[77:24.16]It's incredibly frustrating whenever you, when, when you have to fucking deal with it.
[77:28.08]And I had to deal with it for the last, like two, two to four years straight.
[77:31.54]And it's fucking irritating.
[77:33.32]And every time I see it, I, I start talking about it again.
[77:37.45]And it's just like, so many of you guys just seriously, just don't fucking get it.
[77:42.65]And I have to do what I have to talk for a full minute straight about it.
[77:45.77]And, um, yeah, I, I, maybe I'll write a book one day.
[77:52.01]Maybe I'll write a fucking book one day.
[78:16.58]okay uh that one was very startling lightning one of the most powerful forces in nature that can create fire now harness the power of lightning in the palm of your hand hi I'm hunter ellis and that's why I always carry the tactical atomic lighter the fuel-free rechargeable lighter that works anywhere
[78:35.47]Fuel free?
[78:37.01]Wait, what?
[78:37.53]The secrets are lightning bolt technology.
[78:39.95]Just watch how quickly this incredible new plasma technology creates fire without gas or butane.
[78:45.50]What is it?
[78:46.08]Just press the button and it lights the first time every time.
[78:49.50]You get over 100 lights on a single charge.
[78:52.08]What?
[78:52.24]And it's rechargeable by USB, so it's always good to go.
[78:54.76]It is USB chargeable.
[78:55.36]From lighting birthday candles to cleaning up the end of a rope.
[78:58.19]Can you tase people with this thing?
[78:59.77]It's the best.
[79:00.49]Shh.
[79:01.21]If you need fire, you need the Atomic Lighter.
[79:03.81]There's no Flint, so even if it gets wet, it lights.
[79:07.24]Bonfires, barbecues, or backyard fireworks, nothing compares to the Atomic Lighter.
[79:14.11]Yeah, cool.
[79:14.63]Unlike feeble, pathetic lighters that blow out with a whisper, this thing will never let you down.
[79:19.41]Even during the windiest rainstorm.
[79:21.11]Freezing in a block of ice still works.
[79:23.69]Run it over with a 10-ton tactical vehicle.
[79:26.20]And it keeps on working.
[79:27.88]That's what I call atomic tough.
[79:29.16]I love that shit.
[79:30.16]That doesn't do anything.
[79:33.36]This video has been sponsored by Kiriko.
[79:36.82]How dangerous is an Earth dart?
[79:38.74]Shot faster than the speed of sound.
[79:42.13]What?
[79:46.34]Holy shit, that came out of nowhere.
[79:50.38]Supersonic nerf dart.
[79:51.61]That actually sounds really interesting.
[79:53.53]I'm going to remember this one.
[79:54.57]Okay, that one was crazy, but that one looked fun to use.
[80:01.35]This one's called the Garlic Master, you know, whatever.
[80:04.68]You love cooking with garlic, but cutting those tiny cubes is almost impossible.
[80:09.04]And the garlic press leaves you with a bitter mashed mess.
[80:12.10]Yeah, actually sucks.
[80:13.56]I use it a lot.
[80:14.38]Garlic Master, the revolutionary garlic cutter that precision cuts 81 perfect cubes with just a twist in a split second.
[80:21.50]Amazing.
[80:22.36]Just fill the chamber with cloves and place in the base.
[80:24.85]Now lock on the press and turn.
[80:26.83]In a split second, you get perfectly sized cubes with no effort.
[80:30.25]It's so easy.
[80:31.57]As you twist the top, the press drives the cloves through a stainless steel cutting grid of 16 razor sharp blades.
[80:36.78]Then a second blade cuts the clove into 81 perfect cubes with no waste.
[80:40.80]Now anyone can cut garlic cloves in a split second.
[80:43.48]Just twist the top to bring a burst of natural flavor and nutrients to all your meals.
[80:47.68]Add it to food right on the stove top or just a dash to a plated dish that's ready to serve or slice into the fresh keeping container for odor-free storage in the fridge.
[80:56.18]And the Garlic Master is dishwasher safe.
[80:58.30]It's fast and easy without the mess or the stress.
[81:01.70]It's easy to use, there's no smell on my hands, and it's so easy to clean.
[81:06.04]And garlic keeps me healthy.
[81:20.67]Oh, we got the review right now.
[81:22.15]We got the review right now.
[81:23.37]I love this guy, by the way.
[81:24.83]We got the review.
[81:26.85]Wow, what did that was?
[81:28.27]I mean, look at what you have at your fingertips.
[81:31.91]Look at what you have at your fingertips, by the way.
[81:33.79]We just saw a commercial from like the fucking 90s.
[81:37.43]And then immediately after, not even a tenth of a second, you used to have to pick up a telephone and call somebody.
[81:42.68]Now it's just right here.
[81:44.00]Somebody used it and reviewed it.
[81:45.42]You don't have to do anything.
[81:47.20]Unbelievable.
[81:49.09]We have light that goes through fucking tubes.
[81:53.97]And through the air.
[82:01.10]Anybody else freaking out about this?
[82:10.57]uh this is if you don't know who this is this is freaking reviews uh free it's a great channel tons of products tons of gadgets this is great job reviewing I love this channel it's a great channel uh let's look you know we need to see we need to let's get the verdict and that's what I got out of it I'm not sure that's really 10 well I guess that is 10 close but there you go that was a lot of turning my hand was actually starting to get tired
[82:34.50]oh as you can see there's some garlic still kind of stuck in there it does say that the garlic master can be washed off with warm soapy water you're not subbed you're a fake fan I do all my viewing on my on the iPad I do I don't do anything on here I watch everything every video I've ever seen it was on my iPad it just was every time helps you
[83:01.55]Did it work?
[83:02.67]Looks like it worked.
[83:03.19]And it kind of worked.
[83:05.06]Okay.
[83:06.50]I'd say it kind of worked.
[83:07.36]Let's try another one.
[83:08.04]That's about all I like about it because I like the fact that it creates perfectly square cubes.
[83:14.84]And that's about all I like about it because it kind of takes a long time to create those cubes.
[83:19.14]It took me about 20 seconds and 30 twists of the handle to create cubes from one clove of garlic.
[83:24.44]Okay.
[83:26.02]Alright.
[83:26.56]Yeah.
[83:27.42]I trust everything this guy says.
[83:29.10]And I'm not fucking around.
[83:30.50]I'm not kidding.
[83:36.11]Oh boy.
[83:37.48]What did you put in here?
[83:42.54]messy splatters exploding sauce mystery goo you can't wipe off yeah stop cooking without a cover get hover covered the revolution microwave if it looks like that plastic magnets so it's always ready to use that's right specially designed polymer magnets hold the hover cover up here until you need it down there just pull down to cover when you're magnets in the microwave let it hover
[84:07.01]Hover Cover will stick and stay right in the microwave.
[84:09.55]Just think of the time and mess you'll save.
[84:11.97]Ugh, that container might be microwave safe, but you can't find the lid anyplace.
[84:15.95]But Hover Cover is always where you need it, like a storage door in your fridge.
[84:20.05]Hover Cover upgrades your microwave with a lid.
[84:22.71]Plus, Hover Cover is large enough to fit most dinner plates, dishes, bowls, and even platters.
[84:28.17]And HoverCover still fits in virtually any microwave.
[84:30.47]I got nothing to say.
[84:31.35]It's perfect for best free after school snacks.
[84:33.71]If it works and it's fun and it's safe, I don't know.
[84:36.38]And easy meals on the go.
[84:38.18]What do you want me to say?
[84:39.36]The bowl or plate turns it into a soggy mistake.
[84:42.02]But HoverCover's built-in steam vents let the steam out and keep the splatter in.
[84:46.12]The special BPA-free material stays cool to the touch.
[84:49.24]And the nonstick surface easily wipes or rinses clean.
[84:52.30]Plus, HoverCover is top rack dishwasher safe.
[84:55.15]Hover cover is the best way to make your microwave behave.
[84:58.71]Just pull to cover, then lift to hover.
[85:01.50]No more wrestling with wraps and towels that can end up... Put way too much in.
[85:05.64]Hover cover does the job without getting in the way.
[85:07.92]That's the first rookie mistake.
[85:08.91]Cook, steam, and heat up.
[85:11.39]You gotta heat it up for like 30 seconds.
[85:13.85]Then, there's way too much in there.
[85:15.93]You heat it up for 30 seconds, then you... shlop it around.
[85:19.45]Heat it up for another 30 seconds, shlop it around.
[85:22.04]Maybe 10 to 15, maybe 10 to 15 more seconds.
[85:24.36]Depends.
[85:25.52]And you get, you fill up like a third of the, half the bowl.
[85:27.52]Don't go all the way.
[85:28.30]That one was cute.
[85:30.78]That one was, that one was cool.
[85:39.41]How about the Magic Stacks?
[85:41.47]This is the Magic Stacks.

[86:20.34]It's real life Minecraft.
[86:21.34]Look.

[86:23.40]I don't know what that is.
[86:47.39]I only operate in Super Mario World 1-1 or Minecraft texture pack.
[86:51.47]Okay?
[86:51.65]If I was a kid, I would love playing with this.

[90:29.73]And it seems like things are going better.
[90:32.21]I don't know.
[90:33.29]I guess I can't tell.
[90:34.35]There's no more video.
[90:37.97]Looks pretty happy.
[90:46.04]Oh, I know I've seen this one.
[90:47.54]We've seen this one before, but I wanted to see if I could just not laugh at this.
[90:50.80]Alright, everybody, it's time for the challenge.
[90:52.99]Do not laugh at this next commercial or you lose, and you have to fucking leave.
[90:58.47]You have to leave if you laugh at this.
[91:00.93]You have to leave, and whatever, dude.
[91:02.97]Those are the rules.
[91:05.05]Alright, ready?
[91:06.47]Don't laugh at this at all.
[91:07.65]We all know we shouldn't use cotton swabs to clean or dry our ears.
[91:11.27]They even warn us, but we do it anyway.
[91:13.53]Ah!
[91:13.95]Stop!
[91:14.39]There's a better way.
[91:15.65]Introducing WaxVac, the safe and effective way to clean and dry your ears.
[91:19.89]WaxVac will help your whole family feel better and keep their ears healthier.
[91:23.94]Here's how it works.
[91:24.92]Unlike cotton swabs, which push dirt and harmful wax further into your ear and can puncture your eardrum.
[91:30.56]Ouch!
[91:31.20]WaxVac gently draws dirt particles and moisture out of your ear rather than pushing it in.
[91:35.72]There's nothing else like it.
[91:37.10]WaxVac is quiet.
[91:38.35]Listen.
[91:39.63]Safe.
[91:40.15]Its unique safety guard prevents it from going too deep like an ear thermometer.
[91:43.97]And effective.
[91:44.71]See how gently it vacs water and dirt, leaving your ears clean and dry.
[91:49.42]You just empty it out when you're done.
[91:51.38]Doctors everywhere warn against using cotton swabs to clean your ears.
[91:55.24]Don't use a cotton swab in your ear because it can cause significant damage.
[91:59.34]No one likes water in their ears.
[92:01.22]Don't pound your head.
[92:02.32]Use Wax Vac instead.
[92:04.18]I know I shouldn't use cotton swabs to clean my ears.
[92:07.42]That part gets me every time that I got it.
[92:09.20]I'm fine.
[92:10.14]Sometimes cotton swabs hurt.
[92:11.62]He's treating the guy like a six-year-old.
[92:13.08]I love it.
[92:13.80]What a great idea.
[92:15.25]Wax vac just makes sense.
[92:17.21]Stop using other ear cleaners that don't work.
[92:19.73]And stop using cotton swabs that can damage your ears.
[92:23.11]Ow!
[92:23.55]Call and order the wax back now for only $10 every wax back comes with eight soft color-coated silicone tips for every member of the family And this handy cleaning brush free it even has this powerful examining light, but wait There's more call now, and we'll double the offer you get to wax back And two cleaning brushes for only $10 just pay effective way to clean and dry your ears Don't wait call now
[92:52.79]It's funny.
[92:53.21]It's so funny because this guy is pissed.
[92:57.35]This guy, this guy shoved a cotton swab into his ear and hurt himself.
[93:02.12]And now he's to go to the doctor and the doctor's like, you are, you are an idiot.
[93:06.50]You are a stupid person.
[93:08.24]And he's looking right into the camera and he's very mad.
[93:11.01]Swab in your ear because it.
[93:12.57]and it's almost like this he's like throwing shade at this guy directly but indirectly like dad remember don't put cotton swabs in your ear you know don't do that like I'm a doctor idiot and then a minute later he just does it again sometimes cotton swabs hurt if this makes sense he even owns the product he owns the product now other ear cleaners that don't work and stop using cotton swabs that can damage your ears ow and that one was way worse than the first one
[93:42.38]Oh, don't put cotton swabs in your ear.
[93:47.24]For the love of God, for God's sakes.
[93:51.59]Call and order the wax vac now for only $10.
[93:54.01]Every wax vac... Now, it'll be so much funnier if at the very end of this commercial, when they showed this part up here, it shows the doctor, he shows the guy walking into the doctor's office and walks past a couple nurses, past the doctor, and they all have their arms crossed.

[96:25.51]In a world where interviewers often push their own agendas, some Hollywood stars refuse to play along.
[96:32.48]These are the moments where celebrities completely shut down loaded questions from reporters.
[96:38.26]I don't want to watch this video.
[96:40.48]Alright, how about the power pod?
[96:52.55]you do everything on your phone but when the power runs out you're stranded and all alone and that's a big problem because you can't text and you can't call you got a bike now there's power pod the small but mighty emergency fixes it all so compact it fits right on your keychain so you'll always have the extra power you need
[97:11.60]no matter where you are.

[97:20.01]No cables needed.
[97:21.21]So you always have peace of mind and the power you need.

[97:31.06]It lets you get help during emergencies and makes it easy for kids to always keep in touch.
[97:36.14]So small yet so powerful.
[97:37.96]The secret is Power Pod's micro high velocity technology.
[97:41.24]There it is.
[97:42.12]Instant power that lasts for hours.
[97:44.56]But look, it's smaller than this coin.
[97:47.22]And when the power goes out in your house, you can always rely on Power Pod to keep your phone charged.
[97:52.52]Not on the candles.
[97:53.41]You need those.

[98:05.39]Just plug it in, then use it over and over again.
[98:08.47]This device is dead, but PowerPod gives you enough power to last for hours.
[98:13.39]Works with all of your Android or Apple mobile devices.
[98:16.75]So stop running out of devices.
[98:19.65]Read the bottom.
[98:21.83]We live in a very strange world.
[98:22.79]We live in a very strange world.
[98:27.88]This is to prevent somebody apparently from calling up this company and saying, yeah, I'll take the power pod, uh, the Kindle, the iPad, the iPhone, uh, 13 max and the Android, uh, flip phones, please.
[98:44.16]As well as the pod.
[98:46.66]It's like devices not included.
[98:48.86]Like who would ever think that?
[98:51.58]Is it just a means to like avoid like the weird, potential weird troll people that are like, hey, you didn't say that I wasn't going to get what was on the screen.
[99:01.07]So therefore, where is it?
[99:04.61]Is that what is to prevent?
[99:06.73]Or do people really think that they're going to get all this stuff?
[99:12.41]It's because of a lawsuit.
[99:18.75]Yeah, but who... Okay, well, if you're a judge, is there a judge in America that's going to be like, okay, so let me show you what this case is.
[99:26.19]You sold this power brick for phones.
[99:29.93]And you said, we're selling a power brick for phones.
[99:32.43]And you demonstrated it on a phone.
[99:35.76]And you think that the phone, the iPad, the Kindle, the fucking kazoo, you think all that stuff was included?
[99:45.74]No, it was not at all.
[99:48.40]jury motion to divide for the plaintiff for $45,000.
[99:54.97]So stop running out of power, because now you have all the power you need right at hand.
[100:00.93]I sped that up.
[100:02.63]Everybody loves a good underdog story.
[100:05.01]Wait, wait, wait, why is it a plane?
[100:06.03]People often find themselves inspired by narratives where an unlikely participant rises up against... No, I spoiled it!
[100:11.54]I don't want to spoil what's up.
[100:13.36]Don't look.
[100:14.48]Usually, though, the underdog isn't a literal dog, but I can think of few competitors who have tried to... That's an interesting video, but we're gonna skip it for now.
[100:24.72]Alright, did I miss anyone?
[100:25.98]I might have missed a couple.
[100:30.72]No, I didn't.

[107:36.69]Proudly brought to you by Fein International.
[107:42.76]The worst part of cooking is the prep time.

[107:49.36]Looking to reduce prep time in the kitchen?
[107:51.18]Well, you've hit the jackpot with the exciting new LaPresse Gourmet Food Styler.

[108:23.59]I would say Jim Carrey is one of my childhood heroes, I would say.
[108:29.82]Mask is one of my favorite movies of all time, as is the Ace Ventura movies and Dumb and Dumber.

[108:39.72]But hey, welcome.
[108:40.52]Thanks.

[108:44.15]Let's go.
[108:45.27]Let's go.
[108:48.41]instead of 10 cuts with a doll holy yeah I pressed it 22 razor sharp knife blades working with each pull of the arm well this thing is a crusher potatoes the la presse will mash and peel your potatoes in a single stroke and create perfect guacamole in just seconds
[109:04.24]The La Press will slice, dice, core, mash, juice, and press all in seconds.
[109:08.99]In fact, you could spend hundreds of dollars on kitchen products to do what you can do with just one easy motion of La Press.

[109:20.18]In a single pull of the arm, you'll have stuffed manicotti.
[109:22.66]That's kind of a weird add-on.
[109:24.08]Instant canisius, low-fat or gourmet sausages.
[109:26.54]The LaPresse attaches and stands firm on your counter with its built-in powerful suction.
[109:30.45]I don't know about that.
[109:31.19]And you'll save money.
[109:32.31]Store-bought French fries are expensive.
[109:34.19]Use LaPresse and quickly make healthy, delicious fat-free fries at a fraction of the cost.

[109:57.64]Wow!
[109:58.00]Kathy, that was unbelievable.
[110:09.92]Way quicker than anything else we've seen.
[110:11.34]How did you eat apples?
[110:12.14]I keep punching this.
[110:35.89]I'm going to say one more thing because this is something that I've wanted to do so bad.
[110:49.13]I so badly want to just be that guy with the cocky pants on.
[110:52.89]And they're up to over my belly button and they're tucked in, like my shirt is tucked in.
[110:56.69]I just want to be the weird guy that's just like, that's impossible.
[111:00.79]Kathy, that's not possible.
[111:02.11]But that crunch, that crunch is amazing.
[111:04.50]And have the cocky pants go up over my belly button.
[111:09.14]You see how badly I want that?
[111:17.82]Like, this is something that's a dream of mine.
[111:21.00]The crying game, Kathy.
[111:22.05]Well, that's right.
[111:22.73]But watch this.
[111:23.73]Again, one pull of the LaPresse.
[111:25.73]And I have perfectly chopped on the same blade.
[111:28.43]I know, isn't that cute?
[111:29.65]And again, we're just going to put those in there.
[111:32.07]Why didn't you tell me to do that?
[111:33.01]I thought these were potatoes, Kathy.
[111:34.81]It's a delicious meal, all in one skillet.
[111:37.87]And by the way, that recipe comes with the LaPresse.
[111:40.37]Oh, that's great.
[111:41.09]Take a look at this.
[111:41.99]Now, this is what most people think of as a citrus juice.
[111:44.13]She's so good.
[111:45.30]She's so quick.
[111:46.28]Nobody's going to be better than this ever.
[111:58.76]Look at that juice coming out of there.
[112:00.10]Isn't that great?
[112:00.78]Yeah.
[112:01.68]And here is a glass of health.
[112:04.92]Now, while we're on the subject of citrus, let me show you another attachment we haven't talked about yet.
[112:09.51]Probably is really good.
[112:10.47]Is the quartering disc.
[112:11.97]Wow, these slip in so easily.
[112:13.23]They do.
[112:13.57]They are really easy to put in.
[112:15.13]And with that one, I can make my nice garnishes for my mixed drinks, like my lemonade or, whoops, let me get this guy out of here.
[112:22.91]You're going to be making lemon orange juice there.
[112:24.73]Lemons for your drinks.
[112:26.13]How about some limes?
[112:27.26]Absolutely.
[112:27.72]We're alright.
[112:28.24]Cut away.
[112:28.42]Cut away.
[112:28.90]She'll fix it.
[112:29.48]My kids just like to eat oranges like this.
[112:31.80]Oh, absolutely.
[112:32.18]And they can do it themselves, again, because there's no knife.
[112:34.38]That's actually great.
[112:35.08]So your kids can cut up their own fruits, and you don't have to worry about them using a knife.
[112:38.62]My kids can use this.
[112:39.18]That's right.
[112:39.70]It's wonderful for them.
[112:41.03]Alright.
[112:41.79]Now, Kevin, don't put your hand in there, right?
[112:43.81]The press here is also a ricer.
[112:46.55]Wait a minute.
[112:46.93]What's a ricer, Kevin?
[112:48.08]Well, ricing is just the action of pushing the food through very small holes in order to mash or puree it.
[112:52.08]Like, when's the last time you had mashed potatoes?
[112:54.38]When was the last holiday?
[112:55.81]I know, but why not?
[112:56.95]Yeah, because no one wants to peel the potatoes.
[112:58.89]Exactly right.
[113:00.27]Last time we had potatoes, was that a holiday?
[113:03.05]I think I had potatoes.
[113:05.51]I had mashed potatoes a lot.
[113:07.29]You've got to peel them.
[113:08.15]No, you don't, because I boiled these with the peeling on.
[113:10.40]Watch this.
[113:10.96]I'm just going to drop the potato in there.
[113:12.28]I've got the ricing blade in there.
[113:14.32]And bowl underneath.
[113:15.60]Let's see it.
[113:15.96]And just one press.
[113:16.94]Wow.
[113:18.26]That didn't work in real time.
[113:20.14]This is, hey, by the way, all of you people watching this right now, E3 gameplay.
[113:24.58]Okay.
[113:24.92]Damn.
[113:25.22]Yeah, I had to see that twice.
[113:26.44]Um.
[113:45.60]They're not even seasoned.
[113:53.67]Were they even seasoned or was it just plain potato?
[113:56.01]There's no butter, no salt, no pepper, no thyme, no rosemary.
[113:57.87]What the hell was I even just going to say?
[113:59.95]I need to be reminded.
[114:13.08]What was I going to say?
[114:14.50]Oh, right.
[114:15.00]E3.
[114:15.04]Okay.
[114:15.16]So, you know, this is a product that's being advertised and they're showing actual gameplay footage, by the way.
[114:20.35]There's no faking it here.
[114:21.21]That was in real time.
[114:22.55]That was Cathy Mitchell.
[114:23.35]Actual gameplay.
[114:39.49]wow and there's a potato don't no cut there they could have cut that so you see it peels itself you don't have to peel it first they even did it twice because they knew how good it was and peels the potato automatically let's see that again watch this watch how easy you notice the potato yeah and there it comes just as fast works perfectly that works perfectly to me I love mashed potatoes let's see you be the judge
[115:07.38]I just want to do that.
[115:11.70]I want to be fed a piece of steak and just be like... Oh, oh.
[115:14.75]It's a tender?
[115:15.65]You're telling me that came out of that little machine right there?
[115:20.07]You're telling me that came out of that little machine right there?
[115:25.81]Yes, it's unbelievable.
[115:28.31]Watch this.
[115:29.17]What I've done, remember this, this is a juicing attachment.
[115:31.13]Sure.
[115:31.47]Okay, what I did was I put a piece of bread on it and used that juicer to make little bread cups.
[115:36.96]The crust just falls off, and all you have to do then is take the cup and tuck it right down into a muffin pan just like this.
[115:42.80]Okay.
[115:43.34]Now, we call these eggs in toast cups because they're eggs you don't have to watch.
[115:47.73]They just go right into the oven.
[115:49.47]What about cleaning up the La Presque?
[115:50.59]Oh, well, that's a snap.
[115:52.01]All you do is pop these pieces right into the dishwasher.
[115:54.73]And she comes up with this stuff too.
[115:56.37]She comes up with this.
[115:57.15]I love these sound effects.
[115:58.79]I would love to make these.
[115:59.62]You're just going to throw it into the wok or into the pan and you're just going to start cooking away.
[116:03.54]And one little push of the plunger and you're done.
[116:21.16]Hey, Kathy, take a look at this.
[116:22.42]Huh?
[116:22.94]The LaPresse is well-made, no doubt about it.
[116:25.00]Why a microwave?
[116:25.48]The LaPresse has a very strong suction cup.
[116:27.36]Once it's attached, it doesn't move.
[116:29.24]And I'm certainly glad to see you found a new use for the microwave oven, because you're not going to be using it for these TV dinners anymore.
[116:35.04]Let's talk about potatoes, Beau.
[116:36.68]I'm a big fan of Jed Ryzen, too.
[116:38.22]He just picks it up and just starts swinging it around in a circle and just starts fighting fucking zombies.
[116:42.24]Now, take these mashed potatoes.
[116:43.20]We've already admitted there's no comparison taste-wise.
[116:45.66]You've got to have the real food.
[116:46.62]Exactly right.
[116:47.16]But look at this.
[116:47.98]This box of frozen scalloped potatoes was $3.39.
[116:50.71]I made the same thing for less than a dollar with the LaPresse.
[116:54.71]Under a dollar?
[116:55.43]Ah, they're soaked in oil.
[116:57.11]Let me try this.
[116:58.23]Well, that's a LaPresse healthy oven fry.
[117:00.52]Aren't those delicious?
[117:01.52]Tastes like potatoes.
[117:02.24]Exactly right.
[117:03.10]Now, this is the real culprit.
[117:04.68]When you buy potatoes like this, you're paying almost $2 a pound for potatoes.
[117:09.22]Kathy was into this stuff.
[117:10.08]$0.20 a pound?
[117:10.84]It was buy stuff, buy, like, different types of, like, in bulk or buy other things and kind of repurpose them.
[117:18.35]Wow.
[117:19.37]She was a repurposer.
[117:20.59]Someone call her a genius.
[117:23.09]I would.
[117:23.85]A kitchen genius.
[117:25.53]Alright, well, I'm just going to turn those french fries to the side and push them through.
[117:29.25]How about some peppers?
[117:30.80]I got green and red peppers.
[117:32.22]Put it all through there together.
[117:33.48]And an onion.
[117:35.80]Look how fast this is, Kathy.
[117:37.42]It's fast.
[117:37.96]This actually is, I mean, it's a big piece of equipment.
[117:42.20]But doing that sucks.
[117:43.90]It just does.
[117:44.40]And there's nobody here that can say that, no, I actually like that.
[117:46.71]I don't think anyone on Earth likes to do that.
[117:47.93]We've seen the LaPresse slice, dice, core, mash, juice, and press.
[117:51.87]But the one thing that sets the LaPresse apart from any other kitchen appliance is the extruding function.
[117:57.41]I like that it's relaxing.
[117:58.01]Simply insert the extruder attachments and pressing plate, put your filling in the food tube, and in a single pull of the arm, you have stuffed manicotti.
[118:05.64]filled eclairs, tasty cream puffs, and La Presse is the dieter's delight because you control the ingredients as you make low-fat or gourmet sausages.
[118:14.68]I discovered a great recipe that uses ground turkey.
[118:17.67]Wow.
[118:18.09]So it's really low-fat.
[118:19.25]Now all I've done here is I've mixed up some simple ingredients, a little turkey, some applesauce, some breadcrumbs, and a little seasoning.
[118:24.21]All you do is pop it into the La Presse,
[118:26.55]and this is what we mean by extruding watch this homemade sauce you are making sauce I forgot to I should have told you my favorite word that Cathy Mitchell says is turkey it's it's the she says it's the best way anybody's ever said that word
[118:43.75]I AM MAKING SAUSAGE.
[118:44.65]AND YOU KNOW, THE NEAT THING ABOUT THIS SAUSAGE IS I DON'T FRY IT ON THE STOVE.
[118:47.92]I BAKE IT IN THE OVEN.
[118:49.54]SO IT'S FAST AND IT'S EASY.
[118:51.28]BUT NOT JUST FOR SAUSAGE.
[118:52.78]DO YOU LIKE STUFFED MANNACOTTI?
[118:54.14]OH, ABSOLUTELY.
[118:54.92]BUT THE PROBLEM IS STUFFING IT.
[118:56.70]EXACTLY.
[118:57.36]IT'S NOT EASY TO DO.
[118:58.56]BUT WITH THE LEPRESS IT IS.
[118:59.74]BECAUSE LOOK, YOU CAN JUST USE THE LEPRESS TO FILL THE MANNACOTTI WITH YOUR CHEESE FILLING OR YOUR SPINACH FILLING.
[119:05.10]THIS IS SO GREAT FOR FILLING ANYTHING.
[119:07.08]IT COULD BE JELLY DONUTS OR RECLAIRS OR CREAM PUFF.
[119:09.72]SURE.
[119:10.10]MAKES IT FAST, MAKES IT EASY.
[119:11.58]THAT ACTUALLY IS KIND
[119:13.72]WONDERFUL EASY OVERNIGHT MANICOTTI.
[119:15.44]THAT LOOKS GREAT.
[119:16.24]HERE'S WHAT I'VE GOT.
[119:17.56]OH, LOOK AT THAT.
[119:19.00]FAST AND EASY BREAKFAST.
[119:20.46]GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE.
[119:21.22]WHAT IS THAT?
[119:23.97]DELICIOUS.
[119:24.43]THAT IS DELICIOUS SAUSAGE.
[119:26.25]AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S LOW IN FAT.
[119:27.95]EXACTLY.
[119:28.51]NO FAT AND NO FRYING PAN TO CLEAN UP.
[119:31.05]LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT SOME OTHER PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE PRESS.
[119:36.28]I made Ster-fry the other night with a whole pile of vegetables.
[119:39.23]In seconds, I was done.
[119:40.57]It's quick and easy.
[119:41.55]You just stick the attachment on it.
[119:43.25]You put the bowl underneath it.
[119:44.79]You grab the handle and pull it, and it's right there in a bowl.
[119:47.69]How long has that been under the table for?
[119:51.08]Probably a long time.
[119:52.14]Here's how you can order your LaPresse right now.
[119:54.64]The worst part of cooking is the prep time.
[119:56.74]In most cases, it takes a whole lot less time to eat the meal than it does to do the prep work.
[120:01.04]Are you looking to reduce prep time?
[120:02.58]We can skip this now because we've seen it already.
[120:05.00]I don't know, ones in chat if you want me to skip this part or twos if you want me to stay.
[120:14.37]Yeah, they just replay the commercial like this, like, three or four times.
[120:16.85]I'll go right ahead.
[120:17.65]It's 30 minutes, yeah.
[120:18.53]We'll just go.
[120:38.22]$20 for that is actually a steal.
[120:39.52]I'm trying to think.
[120:56.91]Welcome back.
[120:57.47]We're with Cathy Mitchell.
[120:58.31]10 years ago?
[120:59.51]12 years ago when this came out?
[121:00.77]Well, I think you've seen so far, Beau, that having a LaPresse in your kitchen is like having a sous chef, an assistant in the background, doing all the hard work.
[121:07.83]Oh, it's 60.
[121:08.29]Absolutely.
[121:09.87]And I think I have a perfect thing to show you that with.
[121:12.09]How about something like Ster fry?
[121:13.59]A lot of chopping and slicing on Ster fry.
[121:15.49]That's a lot of stuff to cut up.
[121:16.27]Absolutely.
[121:16.51]I've got here some examples of some of the things you can do with every blade.
[121:19.51]To get started, I'm going to go ahead and toss my meat right in the pan.
[121:22.29]And let's get started on a quick Ster fry.
[121:23.97]Okay.
[121:24.67]She's cooking already.
[121:25.85]Oh.
[121:25.91]I was just gonna ask the same thing.
[121:28.84]Me and this guy got a lot in common.
[121:45.81]I could do it.
[121:46.13]Every single blade and its appropriate pusher is color-coded, as is the tower.
[121:50.35]Oh, please, please, PS5!
[121:52.05]Does anybody even pay attention to that?
[121:54.53]Let me tell you, that is so neat.
[121:56.05]The LaPresse is really a well-thought-out tool, isn't it, Kevin?
[121:58.67]It is.
[121:58.89]You know, and as a man, you appreciate good tools, I'm sure.
[122:01.06]Absolutely.
[122:01.30]If you do any kind of gardening or woodworking, you probably have a garage full of great tools.
[122:05.82]Now we have a great tool for the kitchen.
[122:07.88]and I think we need to get you to work here give me some more damn look at this wow what a line small dicer and that's what I used to do these great julienne strips of zucchini okay and here they go look at that isn't that beautiful
[122:25.24]Yeah, frame it as a tool.
[122:25.76]It's a tool.
[122:26.08]Yeah, it's right.
[122:43.03]I'm going to go ahead and shut it off because I want to show you something near and dear to my family's heart, and that is snacks.
[122:47.59]You don't even know what the fuck you're doing.
[122:49.02]You don't need to know anything.
[122:49.90]Ster fry is great for pretending you know how to cook.
[122:52.66]Okay, Ster fry is awesome because for people that don't know how to cook, you can make yourself look like the best chef in the world.
[122:58.20]You know...
[123:11.66]You like salt, like... You have like a hot pan holder thing like on your belt and just kind of take it and wipe your fingers a little.
[123:25.57]You're a big Coca-Cola guy, right?
[123:29.06]Coca-Cola?
[123:31.01]You can look like an absolute master chef.
[123:33.94]All you're doing is just doing this.
[123:36.26]And people think you're a genius.
[123:39.22]You just put a bunch of shit in there and you just go like this.
[123:42.11]Just confidently do it.
[123:43.17]It doesn't matter.
[123:43.57]People will believe it.
[123:49.07]Jeremy, it looks like there's an oil fire starting.
[123:50.95]What are you talking about?
[123:52.29]Hey, you a Pepsi guy?
[123:53.07]I'm nice and fresh and free.
[123:54.59]Ooh.
[124:14.58]Look at there.
[124:16.82]Nothing but avocado coming through.
[124:18.08]Nothing but avocado.
[124:18.82]So it's the same technique as for stirring it up, right?
[124:21.02]Exactly right.
[124:21.70]You're getting swagger.
[124:22.38]You're putting it in the Ster fry.
[124:24.91]Now I'm going to get everything into that avocado.
[124:26.75]Now here's a quick and easy and workable recipe.
[124:29.51]It caramelizes.
[124:30.15]A little bit of salsa.
[124:33.44]DON'T DO THAT.
[124:36.12]WHY AM I LOOKING AT YOU?
[124:37.18]I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU.
[124:38.26]THAT WAS WEIRD.
[124:38.94]I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.
[124:40.22]NOW LOOK AT THIS.
[124:40.80]THIS IS THE SECRET BECAUSE, YOU SEE, I'M JUST SCURRYING IT.
[124:43.75]NO MASHING, NO CUTTING, NO KNIFE INVOLVED THERE, AND WE'RE DONE IN TIME TO GET BACK TO THE GAME.
[124:52.17]I definitely use La Presse on a daily basis.
[124:55.23]I mean, I would use it every day too.
[124:56.81]Life in the kitchen, much easier.
[124:58.55]I didn't realize how much work there was until I started using La Presse.
[125:02.20]And I was like, oh, I can do this every day and make healthier meals for my family.
[125:08.50]Alright.
[125:09.12]Remember when, again, with the ricing attachment, when I did the guacamole, I used the one with the holes in it.
[125:13.90]Right.
[125:14.12]You're also going to get one with small holes.
[125:16.12]This is perfect for baby food.
[125:18.22]Applesauce.
[125:18.84]You know, the baby can eat everything the rest of the family can eat.
[125:20.90]You're going to feed them baby food?
[125:21.68]This makes baby food as well.
[125:22.78]Absolutely.
[125:23.44]The best baby food because you know exactly what's in it besides it gets a kid used to your cooking.
[125:27.28]Absolutely.
[125:28.36]Now, this is the flat plate.
[125:29.62]There's no holes in this one, and that's the one I've got in there.
[125:32.17]I'm going to use that one for patty making.
[125:33.79]What I do is I paint cupcake paper.
[125:36.05]I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting a bib and like a bonnet and I'm gonna, I'm gonna be sitting in a hot chair.
[125:40.95]And that's where that one's gonna stop.
[125:52.13]And the whole time I'm sitting there going like, I want Cheerios!
[125:55.43]I want Cheerios!
[125:55.93]I want Cheerios!
[126:09.67]I DON'T EVEN WANT THE FOOD THAT IS BEING PRESSED INTO THE PRESS.
[126:13.09]IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WORKED REALLY HARD, AND IT'S SO INCREDIBLY SIMPLE.
[126:16.61]YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GREAT MEAL.
[126:17.95]ALL IT NEEDS REALLY IS A SALAD TO TOP IT ALL.
[126:20.24]THAT'S A GOOD BURGER.
[126:21.02]NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU THINK THERE'S PROBABLY NOT A MACHINE BEEN INVENTED THAT CAN CUT SALAD.
[126:24.92]SO FAR.
[126:25.12]AND I WAS SURPRISED MYSELF THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT.
[126:27.60]WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE HOW THE PRESS FIXES A SALAD.
[126:29.90]AND TO SHOW YOU THAT IT IS REALLY FAST, I'VE SET UP A LITTLE CHALLENGE HERE FOR YOU.
[126:33.62]I WANT YOU TO MAKE A SALAD THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY WITH A KNIFE, AND I'M GOING TO MAKE IT WITH THE PRESS.
[126:39.28]alright now wait before we start let me show you something because I don't like to cut on my eye so we've got available this prep station for your press and what happens you can just attach it right to that and now you have a place to do your cutting cutting directly on your counter now are we ready are you ready I am ready thick slicing are you ready to go okay alright here's the rice I'm gonna cut the lettuce I'm gonna lay it right on there oh and just push it through
[127:03.61]Scat, you made me... Why did you make me go so fast?
[127:06.53]Why are we going so fast with knives?
[127:08.53]Look at that.
[127:08.87]It's slicing it up perfectly.
[127:09.85]I want you to see just how perfect.
[127:11.06]I'm going to go ahead and put it in the bowl here.
[127:12.44]I'm going to do some catching up here.
[127:13.82]There's my lettuce.
[127:14.72]Let me see that.
[127:15.28]Oh, that is perfect.
[127:16.40]Is that perfect lettuce?
[127:17.18]Well, see, I'm having a hard time getting that kind of a slice over here.
[127:19.96]You're doing fine.
[127:21.69]I'm doing the tomatoes now.
[127:23.23]Just lay them right in there.
[127:24.71]They always do that.
[127:25.17]They always lean in to see what you're up to over there.
[127:27.35]And it's always like this.
[127:28.83]They take like 10 to 15 seconds of the 30 seconds looking, leaning.
[127:50.72]Took the same slicer that I just used for the cucumbers and I sliced some apples.
[127:55.52]I'm going to make a quick apple crisp.
[127:56.72]This is big enough for dessert for two.
[127:58.54]Fast and easy.
[127:59.22]You need the tomato.
[128:00.56]Yeah, slicing the tomato is a big deal.
[128:02.80]When I'm done.
[128:03.56]Now, speaking of slicing and dicing lettuce and tomatoes and things, tacos.
[128:07.56]This is the perfect way to cut up your vegetables for your tacos, your lettuce and your tomatoes.
[128:12.03]Here for the salad, I use the thick slicer.
[128:13.91]For the tacos, I use a thin slicer.
[128:15.47]I even use a small dicer to make the cheese.
[128:17.69]I don't do that.
[128:18.39]Why have I not been doing that?
[128:20.23]I split it up into separate bowls.
[128:21.11]They look awful?
[128:21.79]What's wrong with them?
[128:39.58]nice hot apple pie when I'm done now speaking of slicing and dicing lettuce and tomatoes and things tacos this is the perfect way to cut up your vegetables for your tacos your what's wrong with these tomatoes what's wrong with those those look alright I mean they look like a little a little bit like on the I guess like a like uber eats kind of motorcycle going over a few bumps it's fine
[129:05.76]These are American tacos.
[129:06.88]That's gross.
[129:07.62]What do you mean that's gross?
[129:10.63]Why?
[129:10.97]What?
[129:12.71]You guys don't like American tacos?
[129:17.83]I didn't know we had a bunch of taco snobs in here.
[129:20.20]What's wrong with it?
[129:27.45]I am a... I love all tacos and burritos.
[129:30.47]All of them.
[129:32.06]You could put... Just as long as it's a burrito.
[129:35.28]Or a taco.
[129:38.82]That's a salad.
[129:41.25]We don't get to see the ratio of the meat.
[129:43.17]We don't know how much is under there.
[129:44.17]It's right there.
[129:44.67]It's like a solid inch.
[129:47.08]HERE FOR THE SALAD, I USE THE THICK SLICER.
[129:48.96]FOR THE TACOS, I USE THE THIN SLICER.
[129:50.38]AND I EVEN USE THE SMALL DICER TO MAKE THE CHEESE.
[129:52.74]AND HERE'S A LITTLE HINT FOR YOU.
[129:54.05]MIX ALL THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER AND PUT IT ON A BOWL LIKE THAT BEFORE YOU FILL YOUR TACOS.
[129:57.33]THEN YOU GET A BITE OF CHEESE AND LETTUCE AND TOMATO IN EVERY BITE INSTEAD OF STACKING IT UP THERE.
[130:01.71]KATHY, I TELL YOU WHAT, THE LA PRESS DOES SO MANY THINGS.
[130:04.46]IT SAVES YOU TIME AND MONEY.
[130:05.90]AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IT MAKES YOUR LIFE EASIER.
[130:08.75]You don't reach for expensive prepackaged meals that are less healthy, and no more toiling away in the kitchen doing tedious- They're incorporating too much lettuce?
[130:16.60]That is true, you can do too much.
[130:17.68]Because now you have an easier way.
[130:19.62]It will actually cut your prep time in half.
[130:21.37]This flew by-
[130:25.43]Whoa, what happened here?
[130:26.41]Why is it so replayed?
[130:44.94]Was this one person dropping their phone and having to, like, click back, like, three times?
[130:48.56]I don't... What was so crazy about that?
[130:50.90]Oh.
[131:02.82]I actually want to know what some of the cost structure here.
[131:04.92]You get the disc.
[131:05.84]Alright.
[131:06.20]You get the multiplication table.
[131:28.01]Four?
[131:28.15]You guys said it was $60.
[131:28.78]Oh, it wasn't $80.
[131:29.20]No, I'm not going to make it in time.
[131:54.81]It's been like nine years.
[131:57.18]I've missed that window.
[132:07.48]Oh, by the way, I think we're about to get a, uh, I am a restaurateur and I used this goofy product in my restaurant.
[132:18.71]Place your bets.
[132:19.19]Is that what we're going to see here?
[132:21.05]I believe so.
[132:22.47]been secured.
[132:23.49]Just have your checkbook ready when you call.
[132:25.78]And now, here's another easy way to order.
[132:27.92]Log on to Thane.com.
[132:29.73]That's T-H-A-N-E dot com.
[132:32.03]Hurry, call now.
[132:36.18]I like the press because it's simple, it's fast, it's safe.
[132:40.84]See it in your restaurant.
[132:42.80]And ultimately, it's fun.
[132:44.46]One thing I was really impressed by the press was, first of all, its design in my kitchen.
[132:51.99]It looked really very appealing to the eye.
[132:54.69]And then secondly, too, of course, it's more than practical.
[132:57.73]I thought it was...
[132:59.41]I had a lot of vegetables to work on, and as soon as I used the press, I realized how convenient and fast it was to take care of all my vegetables in terms of chopping, dicing, and slicing.
[133:11.99]Any home cook should be using this tool.
[133:15.24]And primarily because it's fast and it's very simple.
[133:19.72]In no time, you're able to dice and chop.
[133:22.68]I was stunned by how quick and easy it was to make some orange juice, for example, or to chop three pounds of carrots.
[133:31.11]Cutting up fruit sucks.
[133:31.71]I did that in less than three minutes.
[133:33.23]Because my philosophy, if you spend less time in the kitchen, you can spend more time with your family or doing something else.
[133:39.97]Holy shit, I was impressed in that box.
[133:42.69]Wait, did he make the tacos?
[133:45.17]What is he carrying over to the table?
[133:48.32]That's what's for dinner?
[133:49.50]Three pounds of carrots?
[133:50.60]If you spend less time in the kitchen, you can spend more time with your family.
[133:59.05]I think it's tacos.
[134:01.27]Or doing something else.
[134:03.47]I think it's the tacos that she was just making.
[134:08.93]I SHOW YOU THE PRESS VERSION OF A TV DINNER, WHAT I CALL DINNER IN FOIL.
[134:13.42]I'VE GOT A SQUARE OF FOIL HERE.
[134:15.36]WHATEVER YOU LIKE.
[134:16.22]I LIKE CHICKEN.
[134:17.26]YOU LIKE THE BURGERS?
[134:18.02]YOU GOT IT.
[134:18.48]WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SAUCE.
[134:20.20]PUT YOUR SAUCE RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MEAT.
[134:22.04]THIS MEAT IS FROZEN.
[134:22.96]I'M GOING TO PUT A LITTLE TERIYAKI.
[134:24.38]ANY KIND OF VEGETABLES YOU WANT.
[134:26.41]HOW ABOUT SOME ONION?
[134:28.75]SURE.
[134:28.87]THIS IS IN THE RECIPE BOOK, BUT YOU REALLY DON'T NEED A RECIPE FOR THIS.
[134:32.15]Are they going to squish it together?
[134:34.17]So you build your own TV dinner, right?
[134:35.51]You just fold it up?
[134:36.09]Exactly.
[134:36.67]Once you've got it done, just fold up those ends.
[134:38.21]And I don't care whether you're camping, in a boat, a motorhome, on the grill, or just want a quick dinner that's fast and you don't have to watch it.
[134:45.86]You just pop those in the oven.
[134:47.44]And in no time, this is what you've got.
[134:49.98]Take a look at that.
[134:51.18]Oh, they didn't even... Okay, they just made dinner.
[134:54.28]And no pots, no pans to wash.
[134:56.24]Easy and fast.
[134:57.06]All done with a little press.
[135:00.67]The press makes you look cooler than you really are because you look like you went to chef school or something and you didn't.
[135:06.79]Is there even an oven down there?
[135:08.11]Probably not.
[135:08.82]I don't think so.
[135:09.28]The press, I think, will actually help you to become a better cook.
[135:13.00]It's a creative machine.
[135:14.08]It's got a lot of different attachments that you can... That's right.
[135:18.84]ALRIGHT, WE'RE GETTING TO THE CLIMAX HERE.
[135:20.08]WHETHER YOU ALREADY COOK OR YOU SIMPLY WANT TO COOK MORE, I THINK YOU CAN SEE THE LAPRESS IS THE KEY TO PREPARING FAST, EASY, AND HEALTHY MEALS, RIGHT, KATHY?
[135:27.71]THAT'S RIGHT, BO.
[135:28.69]THE LAPRESS IS FAST, FUN, AND EASY ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR FAMILY TO USE.
[135:32.27]YOUR KIDS WILL PUT SLICED FRUIT ON THE CEREAL AND CUT UP THEIR OWN FRUIT SNACKS.
[135:35.65]LET'S FACE IT, FOR HEALTH REASONS, WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO BE EATING AT LEAST SIX SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES EVERY DAY, AND THE LAPRESS
[135:41.54]Yeah, that's hard.
[135:42.30]Well, it certainly does.
[135:43.38]That's actually hard.
[135:44.20]That's very difficult to do, honestly.
[135:46.29]No peeled mashed potatoes we made with a press.
[135:48.33]And, of course, the one-minute killer guacamole.
[135:50.19]Well, you're going to use it every day because it makes real food fast food.
[135:53.58]Well, I can't wait to use mine.
[135:54.80]I mean, it really makes you want to cook more, doesn't it, Kathy?
[135:56.72]It does, and you may have more help in the kitchen than you ever dreamed of because everyone wants to use LaPresse.
[136:01.53]I could see it.
[136:02.33]If I was a kid, I'd go in there like, Kathy, thank you so much for introducing us to LaPresse.
[136:06.67]It's been fun.
[136:07.67]Oh, that flew by.
[136:08.53]I loved every second of that.
[136:09.45]What a great film.
[136:09.91]What a great film.
[136:10.33]Part of the Cathy Mitchell collection.
[136:22.36]I have the box set.
[136:23.90]I have the 30 DVD box set of the Cathy Mitchell filmography.
[136:30.64]I think that's it.
[136:31.76]That is it.
[136:34.24]Alright, what's next?
[136:37.98]We're just going to keep going.
[136:39.62]I'm probably going to get up and pee in a minute here.
[136:42.94]Grab another drink.
[136:44.06]My throat's getting dry.
[136:48.47]We've seen the onion bloom.
[136:51.79]Have we seen this?
[136:52.53]Did we see scoop it up?
[136:56.30]Scoop it.
[136:58.36]I don't think we saw scoop it.
[137:06.64]Is more of your food going everywhere except into the frying pan?
[137:10.35]Hate cleaning up those messy spills on your counters or dried baked on food on your cooktop?
[137:15.07]Okay, who said it last time?
[137:17.21]I gotta make the same joke twice because that's all I do.
[137:21.28]Every time you see the black and white, just imagine that that person is shit-faced.
[137:25.58]And don't think about anything else.
[137:27.34]Only think about they just got back.
[137:29.32]They just like all, you know, seven or eight people just got to like a flat, right?
[137:34.43]And they're all shit-faced.
[137:36.03]They were all like in a taxi.
[137:37.07]They all got home.
[137:38.05]And now it's time for somebody to make some food.
[137:40.31]That is what every single black and white cutaway in the kitchen in these infomercials is.
[137:44.90]Don't think about anything else.
[137:45.76]Remember, this person's drunk.
[137:46.96]They're shit-faced.
[137:49.21]they're like nine beers deep is more of your food going everywhere that's how it works hey cleaning up those messy spills on your counters or dried baked on food on your cooktop introducing scoop it the easy way to get the food the whole food and nothing but the food from the chopping
[138:04.66]I can't even see it.
[138:05.52]It's like a weird 1995 cell phone quality.
[138:07.44]It feels like I'm in a dream.
[138:08.48]It feels like an AI video.
[138:09.20]There's AI videos that look like this and it's off of my head.
[138:25.97]He keeps showing this one.
[138:43.37]Scoop it's magnificent for meats and perfect for poultry and it's I can't even tell what it looks like scoop it and pour it No more touching food.

[144:41.22]A day with Sid, Ed, and the CDI.
[144:50.69]We'll do this right after I go to the bathroom.
[144:52.55]I'm going to go pee.
[144:53.53]I'll be right back.
[144:54.83]Maybe like four or five minutes.
[144:58.01]I think Otto might need to go out too.
[145:01.07]I'll be right back.
[145:09.90]I moved a bunch of files on my computer.
[145:12.55]I have no idea what the BRB video is.
[145:16.55]Hold on.
[145:17.09]Okay, I'm going to have to improvise here.
[145:19.66]BRB.
[155:34.05]Hello.
[155:36.51]That was kind of a long one.
[155:38.75]I almost just apologized.
[155:41.34]No.
[155:42.40]No.
[155:44.78]I was BRB.
[155:56.78]Yeah, Otto needed to go out and Otto also needed to eat.
[156:01.80]And I'm going to feed auto while I already did.
[156:04.64]Alright.
[156:06.62]So the next one is a Phillips CDI.
[156:08.38]It's a long one.
[156:08.96]If we need to skip a little, we can, why does this guy pause everything and just like talk?
[156:17.79]I don't know.
[156:23.23]That's what I do.
[156:27.03]Okay.
[156:30.06]Let me make sure my mic is in the right spot.
[156:33.68]Okay.
[156:33.92]Can you hear me?
[156:34.74]Are we, are we good?
[156:35.60]Okay.
[156:43.53]I'm ready to watch the CDI infomercial.
[156:48.37]You ready?

[157:00.20]Oh, you guys can't hear it.
[157:00.82]Hold on.
[157:03.34]I don't know.
[157:04.22]I heard what they said, but you didn't.
[157:08.19]CDIs.
[157:09.51]And when are you going to grow up and sell something people use?
[157:12.33]What are you talking about?
[157:13.61]Oh, that's actually kind of extended warranties.
[157:17.19]Hey, don't forget I'm also the one who repairs things under those warranties.
[157:21.47]Not if I get there first.
[157:24.01]Not if I get there first.
[157:26.40]Put it back.
[157:29.34]where are they today here so that's how it began ed late for work as usual and me off the cell cdi you know but I'm getting ahead of myself little tipping in the wrong button
[157:48.92]This is going to be good.
[157:50.32]See, my first customers were soon to be Timmy and his mom.
[157:53.37]Seeing that loading a game on dad's new CD-ROM computer was more than they bargained for.
[157:57.37]It was horrible.
[157:58.03]Don't touch anything, OK?
[157:59.33]Timmy, you're not doing anything.
[158:10.99]Oh, no.
[158:15.63]Don't do that.
[158:16.63]Mom, what does erase disk mean?
[158:21.61]You should have asked that question before you pressed the button, honey.
[158:25.27]It wasn't long after that Ed got the call from his dispatcher.
[158:27.95]Earl here.
[158:29.23]Yeah, Earl.
[158:30.46]We've got a computer down.
[158:31.64]You better write this down.
[158:35.62]2111 Pine Street.
[158:38.74]Seems the young man
[158:41.19]Now don't think of me as stealing Ed's customers.
[158:44.45]Are they both CDI salesmen?
[158:47.47]Robin Hood for the information age, if you will.
[158:57.86]It's already there.
[158:58.78]So, you hit a pothole on the information superhighway, huh?
[159:01.98]Wow, that was fast.
[159:03.06]We ready?
[159:03.96]Uh, yeah, the computer is right there.
[159:05.56]Why are they dressed like this?
[159:07.76]Uh-huh.
[159:09.65]It's a video game system, right?
[159:12.67]So this guy comes into their house.
[159:31.40]with the intention of what was asked to fix the computer, brings a absolutely $600 or $700 item into the house, plugs it in instead, gets the kid to come over to get excited about the $1,000 new video game machine to make sure he gets a sale.
[159:49.89]He had no intention of fixing that computer.
[159:52.98]What an asshole.
[159:55.49]It plays everything from music CDs to educational games, all through your television, all on its big screen, and all in full motion digital video.
[160:04.58]But more importantly, though, it helps keep Shorty over there.
[160:08.22]Timmy!
[160:09.00]From Trash and Dad's computer.
[160:10.86]Hey, Michelangelo.
[160:11.72]And the house, apparently.
[160:12.54]You like crayons, huh?
[160:14.03]How'd you like to try this?
[160:15.29]Crayon Factory.
[160:17.87]Put it in?
[160:21.95]Wow, you really fucked that up, kid.
[160:24.81]Holy shit, your kid is dumb, lady.
[160:26.77]Lady, your kid's dumb.
[160:27.55]I'm sorry.
[160:28.67]Like, he's... Your kid's... This is a stupid kid.
[160:31.85]This is a very dumb child.
[160:33.55]And, um... I don't... I don't know.
[160:37.53]I guess, whatever.
[160:38.17]This is... Another price, kid.
[160:46.81]Oh, he's a check-this-out guy.
[160:50.45]Oh, he's a check-this-out guy.
[160:52.21]Oh, God, man.
[160:52.73]I want to keep it.
[161:02.09]I mean, just look at this.
[161:02.91]You've got mixing and matching, sorting and solving, and if they aren't solving and sorting or mixing and matching, they're figuring out pattern recognition and quality control.
[161:10.59]Um, hi.
[161:12.47]Hello.
[161:13.03]Excuse me a minute.
[161:14.01]Remember me?
[161:14.57]Hey, the CD-ROM?
[161:17.20]Bonnie, you should mention the CD-ROM.
[161:19.36]Oh?
[161:19.84]CDI here has everything you'd get in a CD-ROM, except the problems.
[161:24.22]with cdi just put in your disc and play no loading problems no complicated equipment nothing I mean cdi plays educational titles music I mean this is the first video game console ever this would be huge but that's how that's how they're asking troll you're gonna love this chaos control sound familiar
[161:54.98]He's playing an all-rated video game in front of this kid.
[161:57.68]You're just sitting there.
[162:22.74]Oh, I'm sorry.
[162:24.95]Listen, I'm sure my husband would find this fascinating, but me, on the other hand, I think I would like to try... What game?
[162:34.43]Oh, you know, he bought the CD-ROM, and he has all his favorite golf games on it, and...
[162:42.57]Oh, golf games.
[162:43.97]Check it out.
[162:44.75]The entire game is played against real footage from 18 of the most recognized holes in Palm Springs.
[162:49.65]Every shot is recreated to the smallest detail.
[162:52.29]Hook it, and you're in the rough.
[162:53.58]Too far?
[162:54.24]You're in the traps.
[162:55.26]Slice it, and you're swimming.
[162:57.34]Nevertheless, the biggest selling point has to be that you can play like a seasoned golfer without having to dress like one.
[163:02.38]Oh, don't worry.
[163:04.04]It's CDI.
[163:05.68]So, you like bears, Timmy?
[163:09.21]Why not try it on this here optional roller controller?
[163:13.59]Uh, I'm sorry, this is a very bad salesman.
[163:16.85]Because... What's the thing that pops up every time you turn your console on or turn it off or you do an update?
[163:23.74]Even to this day, it doesn't matter.
[163:25.00]We're in 2025 now.
[163:26.90]And they, apparently, they still tell you do not press the power button.
[163:33.78]Don't just press the power button on any of these things.
[163:37.25]Ever.
[163:38.40]You have to shut it down or you have to put it in rest.
[163:40.86]You just power, just turn it off.
[163:43.16]It says, don't do that.
[163:44.80]It says, do not lose power.
[163:47.60]Don't press the power button.
[163:49.91]He should have flipped out.
[163:52.59]Huh?
[163:53.05]You see, Berenstain Bears is another one of CDI's great educational titles.
[163:56.87]I mean, CDI has games to teach spelling.
[163:59.25]There's games to teach grammar, even games to teach reasoning.
[164:05.08]With Berenstain Bears, to play at the fair, kids have to first learn responsible behavior.
[164:09.54]You know, the things you use throughout your life.
[164:16.86]But our computer has a CD, which... What it all comes down to is this.
[164:21.53]Computers are great for computer kinds of things, but let's face it, a computer makes for a very fragile, not to mention expensive, game machine.
[164:29.51]Well, that's where CDI comes in.
[164:32.19]It's everything you use your CD-ROM for and then some.
[164:35.84]CDI offers both education and entertainment.
[164:38.78]It's like so many revolutions on that ball.
[164:42.14]Listen, last pause, I swear.
[164:45.31]Listen to how many revolutions that ball makes, sir.
[164:49.03]You know, the things you use throughout your life.
[164:51.47]But our computer has a CD, which... What it all comes down to is this.
[164:56.12]Computers are great for computer kinds of things, but let's face it.
[165:00.16]Computer makes for a very fragile, not to mention expensive, game machine.
[165:04.10]Well, that's where CDI comes in.
[165:06.80]It's everything you use your CD-ROM for, and then some.
[165:10.42]CDI offers both education and entertainment.
[165:13.86]All through your television, all in CD-quality surround sound, all full-screen, and all in full-motion digital video.
[165:21.35]And if that wasn't enough, CDI's so simple, anyone can use it, which keeps Junior here from playing the computer unsupervised.
[165:27.89]Uh-huh.
[165:29.19]Ooh, nice one.
[165:30.27]Yep, no need to thank me.
[165:34.07]I'm just here to help.
[165:35.23]So do we even need... What's the plot with the other guy?
[165:39.01]While my mission in life was to introduce people to the wonders of CDI, Ed's mission was to make as much while doing as little as possible.
[165:51.34]now with the kathy smith workout disc you can work out as much as you want without having to drag timmy here to the gym you tailor your training to your individual goals watch this see that yeah why is he still here on file you can change pace in the middle of a workout
[166:12.21]Oh, boy, I mean, just look at that.
[166:14.91]Muscle toning, body sculpting.
[166:16.79]There's aerobics, aeroboxing.
[166:18.60]Why, you'll be sweating with the sveltes in no time.
[166:21.62]Not only is it a great way to get in shape, it's a great way to stay in shape.
[166:25.50]Of course, working out at home not only saves time and money, it also keeps you within comfortable reach of your fridge.
[166:32.74]Oh, hell.
[166:33.66]No worries.
[166:34.82]There's still more than 200 titles to go.
[166:38.47]Actually, I was thinking about... I want a CDI eventually here.
[166:42.95]I don't know how crazy it is to find one.
[166:44.97]Four weddings and a funeral, perhaps?
[166:46.15]How about something like... Like something you could play with your husband and friends?
[166:52.39]The live-action, interactive version of the board game Clue.
[166:56.02]Actually, I was thinking about... That excites me.
[166:58.90]The racy political murder mystery Voyeur.
[167:01.24]What is this?
[167:01.78]I need to play this.
[167:02.98]We have to get this.
[167:04.32]The educational children's game Sticky Bear Math?
[167:10.35]Jeopardy?
[167:11.91]I thought you'd never ask.

[167:15.86]You bet.
[167:16.80]This is Jeopardy.
[167:19.12]Let's put the dollar values on the board.
[167:21.78]How about American history?
[167:23.70]You're good at that?
[167:25.48]Yeah.
[167:25.64]Yep, don't you two worry about me.
[167:27.37]I'll let myself out.
[167:29.19]First President of the United States.
[167:33.59]Who's George Washington?
[167:35.47]Yes, Timmy.
[167:37.45]Good job.
[167:38.65]Look at the mod chat right now.
[167:40.21]I think this guy's also in the Nintendo 64 rumble pack special.
[167:42.99]Not to make excuses for him, but Ed was born 20 minutes after me and he's been late ever since.

[170:12.73]Introducing anything new to teenagers is always tough.
[170:15.79]They think they know everything about everything, and everything is boring.
[170:19.73]But these three young men were about to get a wake-up call from ZDI Sid.
[170:23.50]Hey, Dwayne.
[170:24.08]You're going to get some new games for this thing.
[170:28.66]I don't know.
[170:31.20]Wait, what are they playing?
[170:32.06]What are they playing?
[170:32.60]Hey, Dwayne, watch what you're doing.
[170:34.91]I mean, I can play this in my sleep.
[170:36.63]Yeah.
[170:41.86]Dude, you broke, what are they, what console are they on?
[170:47.62]Look what you've done.
[170:48.56]Why are you blaming me?
[170:50.44]Megadrive?
[170:50.76]What do you think?
[170:52.28]Oh, sure.
[170:53.56]Put it on the shelf.
[170:54.46]No one will know.
[170:55.92]I wish.
[170:56.82]My dad plays this thing all the time.
[170:59.44]What are we going to do?
[171:01.48]I know.
[171:02.06]Tell him you came home.
[171:02.90]It was already broken.
[171:04.23]Tell him the house was haunted by a poltergeist.
[171:05.87]It sounded like the poke voice.
[171:07.15]And this was just a warning.
[171:11.75]Uh, hey, Ed.
[171:12.81]Yeah.
[171:13.57]What is it?
[171:14.11]Was that the poke voice?
[171:15.53]When he does that voice?
[171:16.59]A young man in need of assistance over at 219er South Cherry Glen.
[171:21.93]That's 219 South Cherry Glen.
[171:25.43]Can you get right over there?
[171:27.23]Not before me, Eddie.
[171:32.23]what these guys are twins and one of them just makes a bunch of money and sells a bunch of stuff and the other one just like sleeps in his car and they work at the same company oh game machine doa huh yeah can you fix it oh I'll take care of it alright
[171:49.19]Okay, this goes in here, this in here, this in here, and there you go.
[171:54.39]Alright, the teenagers are going to require something cool.
[171:58.23]We better see something cool.
[172:00.05]It does the work of a VCR, a CD player, a game machine, and a CD-ROM all in one.
[172:05.14]And what are we supposed to do with it?
[172:06.94]Oh, I don't know, Einstein.
[172:08.52]I'll go out on a limb and say, watch movies, listen to compact discs, play games, interact with multimedia titles.
[172:14.86]Uh-huh, neat.
[172:15.62]Now, can you fix the machine so we can get back to our game?
[172:18.69]I thought you fellas might be into something more challenging than those two-dimensional things.
[172:22.89]You know, something with full-motion digital video, killer graphics, a plot.
[172:28.32]Like what?
[172:29.76]Hi, Dad here.
[172:31.08]Just noticed you came in my house, and you're in my underage child's room with two of his underage friends.
[172:38.16]How did you get in here, and what the fuck is your name?
[172:40.72]Please tell me your name, and why are you in my house?
[172:46.89]How'd you get in here?
[172:50.08]You boys think you're man enough for burn cycle?
[172:54.54]You see, the hook here is you're a software thief who ran into a little problem.
[172:58.82]Someone finds out what you're up to and now you're running around with a cyber virus in your skull.
[173:02.93]And unless you can figure out how to get it out in the next 120 minutes, kaboom, you'll be re-wallpapering your bedroom with ground chuck.
[173:12.91]This sucks.
[173:13.61]I would be pissed.
[173:16.29]I'd be like, bro, the games you like are bad.
[173:19.74]You're like a weird guy and we want to just play Sonic again.
[173:22.80]Can you get out of here?
[173:23.94]He's going to get his ass kicked.
[173:47.68]Hmm.
[173:48.06]Hmm.
[173:49.32]Perhaps another one for Pops.
[173:52.12]Ah, here it is.
[173:53.50]Chaos Control.
[173:54.72]He fucking loves this game.
[173:56.57]Strap in, boys.
[173:57.31]You're outnumbered five to one by these planetary probes.
[174:00.07]This is the type of shit that happens when you play WoW.
[174:04.79]Holly and I have obviously been watching and been participating in the WoW hardcore classic.
[174:09.39]It's been very fun to watch.
[174:10.81]This is what happens when you desperately want someone to play a game that you're playing and they just have no interest but you just keep bringing it up.
[174:17.40]Uh, that's what it's like to try to tell World of Warcraft to anybody.
[174:20.56]Ever.
[174:21.44]It's just like, I bring it up a lot, and people are just like, oh yeah, cool, he's gonna bring up WoW.
[174:25.20]You guys bring it up a lot too.
[174:26.82]Like, I say it all the time.
[174:28.46]Um, yeah, I'm the guy that tries to tell, like, I'm the guy that tries to manipulate you into playing the game that I want you to play.
[174:36.47]Oh, World of Warcraft!
[174:37.63]Yeah, it's like this new mode came out.
[174:39.69]Why don't we just look at it?
[174:41.52]...fighting across the deck of the Keshron mothership.
[174:43.74]They've got stragglers screaming through the solar system, annihilating anything that moves.
[174:47.60]So you're up here whipping around, picking off those barbarians left and right, vying for global salvation.
[174:52.86]But these guys are relentless.
[174:54.78]No timeouts, nothing.
[174:56.06]Once you blast one, another one keeps coming right at it, right after it ends.
[175:02.09]This is a very weird game.
[175:03.03]He said, why is there a mechanic in my son's room?
[175:05.34]And he's in a fucking jumpsuit.
[175:06.48]Like a mechanic jumpsuit.
[175:07.48]Oh, that's a good one.
[175:08.26]Right, right, right.
[175:31.13]Now, you see here, fellas, what you got... Where else can you find a full-screen experience like this?
[175:35.46]Over, over, over.
[175:36.62]All on your big-screen TV.
[175:38.10]Energize, energize.
[175:39.16]And all in full-motion digital video.
[175:40.68]Up, up, up.
[175:41.54]And all with CD sound.
[175:43.50]Wow, that's killer sound.
[175:44.96]Boys, what it boils down to is this.
[175:46.90]What you have here is an incredibly simple machine.
[175:49.40]Easy to set up, easy to use, playing everything from interactive titles to music videos to audio CDs.
[175:55.38]All in one self-contained system that just hangs out in your living room.
[175:59.80]I mean, CDI has something for everyone.
[176:01.97]You have Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia to help you with your homework.
[176:05.39]Kathy Smith's Workout Disc for your mom.
[176:07.27]Cathy Mitchell.
[176:07.97]Sticky Bear Math for your little brother.
[176:09.56]Cathy Mitchell's... Palm Springs Golf for pops.
[176:11.46]Turbo Cooker.
[176:12.08]It plays full-length feature movies for the whole family.
[176:16.63]Was that a car?
[176:18.10]This place is a mess.
[176:19.40]My dad... Does he help them clean?
[176:21.94]You're on your own there.
[176:23.16]Oh, man.
[176:24.96]By now I knew Ed was plenty fed up with finishing second, but I thought he was too stubborn to ever change his ways.
[176:31.51]Later, I'd be in for a surprise.
[176:33.17]Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
[176:35.21]That's not your dad.
[176:35.95]Maybe one of these days you'll actually get something constructive done.
[176:39.94]Whoa.
[176:43.48]now that you know what you're gonna fight it's clear why cdi is cd for your TV with cdi you'll look 265 dollars of cdi's best titles we're getting to the uh the climax of this episode call during this limited time offer and find out how easy versatile and inexpensive cdi can be expensive that's like one thousand dollars fifteen hundred dollars in today's money
[177:11.77]And finally, we came to Peter and Gina.
[177:14.11]This pair loves movies.
[177:15.45]Unfortunately, over the years, their VCR had developed quite an appetite, making my twin brother Ed a frequent visitor.
[177:22.84]It's a tape, Peter!
[177:24.82]It's a tape!
[177:25.20]Get the tape!
[177:26.02]It's an even tape!
[177:28.06]Oh, Forrest Gump is only three weeks old.
[177:33.04]If we have to replace one more movie, that thing devours.
[177:36.74]I know.
[177:37.14]I know.
[177:38.14]I don't remember that really happening that often.
[177:39.99]We have an extended warranty from Ed.
[177:41.53]Let's just try and resurrect this thing one more time.
[177:45.69]Meanwhile, Ed was... Big surprise here.
[177:49.27]Hey, Ed.
[177:50.05]Earl here.
[177:51.09]Earl!
[177:52.31]We got a VCR down over at Peter and Gina's again.
[177:55.25]I think you know where they're at.
[177:57.65]Which, of course, gave me plenty of time to show Peter and Gina movies on CDI.
[178:02.07]Which, of course, leads me back to the story.
[178:04.45]It's Goofus and Galant.
[178:08.76]Goofus and Gallant.
[178:09.74]One of them is going to come and fuck up your house.
[178:11.92]And the other one is going to fix everything.
[178:15.04]Do you ever think that the story of Cain and Abel from the Bible is just the original Goofus and Gallant?
[178:33.66]This plugs in here, this here, this here.
[178:37.68]There you go.
[178:38.84]All fixed.
[178:39.91]What exactly do you mean, Sid?
[178:41.37]All fixed.
[178:43.55]I... What is... It's the new way to watch movies.
[178:47.25]You kids like movies.
[178:49.78]How about movies on CDI?
[178:54.68]CDI.
[178:56.00]Compact Disc Interactive.
[178:59.60]It plays full-length feature movies and more.
[179:02.10]Okay.
[179:02.32]It plays them all on compact discs.
[179:03.90]We're going to pause.
[179:05.13]Don't pause it.
[179:05.95]Don't pause it.
[179:06.43]Just pause it for a second.
[179:07.57]Whatever.
[179:08.23]We're fine.
[179:08.59]I can pause the movie.
[179:10.83]What's really interesting about the CD-I, when we did the 3DO, I talked about this a little bit too.
[179:17.51]Playing movies on your video game console.
[179:20.89]Yeah, you guys, everybody knows that's a thing.
[179:23.49]We don't even do that anymore anyways.
[179:24.67]It's all digital, whatever.
[179:25.71]Netflix and, you know, Hulu.
[179:27.99]But back then, being able to do that, being able to actually put a disc, a movie into a console was crazy.
[179:39.70]Yeah, I know PS2, that's right.
[179:42.14]But the PS2 didn't have golf.
[179:48.24]ps3 blu-ray ps2 is nuts ps2 might actually be probably like the probably like the most ridiculous console that like ever came out didn't it sell like a hundred trillion copies or something that came much later yeah that's what I mean
[180:07.57]When did the CDI come out?
[180:10.43]And then after that, like after it failed, which is so sad in a way because it was doing so many things that everybody wanted.
[180:16.51]They just didn't even know they wanted yet.
[180:18.54]1990.
[180:18.56]Yeah.
[180:23.78]So the the act of doing putting DVDs into a console was a big deal.
[180:28.81]Everybody had DVDs, everybody had CDs, everybody had movies and TV shows.
[180:33.11]It was just too early.
[180:33.95]It was just way too early.
[180:35.17]And they were too good at what they did.
[180:37.19]Philips was too, Philips and 3DO were both way too good at what they were doing.
[180:43.57]They developed it too good too fast.
[180:46.89]The market wasn't ready for it.
[180:47.95]It was another five to 10 years later.
[180:51.67]They did too good of a job, is what I'm saying.
[180:54.09]...a funeral, one of the dozens of motion pictures... And it was very expensive, that's right.
[180:57.55]...and plays them all with CD sound.
[180:59.63]It's a home cinema, right in your own living room.
[181:02.41]Have a seat.
[181:03.74]Let go.
[181:06.32]Now, you just hit play and... What movie is it?
[181:11.72]Hey, you guys got any popcorn?
[181:14.06]Popcorn?
[181:15.46]Um... We have rice cakes.
[181:18.46]Right.
[181:19.84]better yet why watch a movie now I mean it's not like a cd has the life expectancy of a video eating like if you know what hair slices out of a plastic bag why is he not excited about healthy things more caesar's world of boxing ish distract me as someone who knows how to take care of business handle themselves in a brawl here you go
[181:48.07]Now check this out.
[181:49.55]You select your own boxer, pick his form, choose his specs.
[181:53.30]Somebody just called this guy a leech.
[181:54.76]By now, Ed was so late, he'd lost his best customer.
[181:58.00]And this would prove to be the final straw.
[182:05.18]Oh, oh, oh, yeah, alright.
[182:07.12]Oh, I've got a really good feeling for this.
[182:09.39]Oh, hey, hey, hey.
[182:11.57]Oh, oh, oh, oh, he's cut.
[182:15.33]He's bleeding.
[182:16.23]Blood, blood, yes.
[182:18.16]Alright, settle down there, Rocco.
[182:20.98]Oh, we gotta play this.
[182:38.86]you can watch confessions from the other players or find that last missing piece of the jigsaw oh I love that character already recognize the rooms to the last detail to help you solve the killing and just what do you suppose drove one to such an act then again why dwell on a nasty subject like homicide when that successful marketing how about burn cycle
[183:02.15]Here's an interactive adventure.
[183:03.19]Yeah, and I'm probably going to have to pay two or three times that amount that's advertised, by the way.
[183:05.95]With all the cinematics and theatrics of a full-length movie.
[183:09.07]You see, you had a little incident while stealing some software.
[183:12.03]Now you're doing everything from shooting your way out of a software company to blending in with the bottom dwellers of the city.
[183:18.20]Okay, okay, like, look here.
[183:19.80]To get anywhere, you have to solve a series of puzzles.
[183:22.80]And we're not exactly talking the tic-tac-toe variety either.
[183:27.00]You also want to avoid the people that are out to kill you?
[183:31.20]Oh, yeah.
[183:31.84]The impressive thing is you're doing it with a time bomb ticking away in your head.
[183:36.51]Is this chaos control?
[183:37.55]You guys don't have a CD player either.
[183:39.89]Well, as if this wasn't your lucky day already.
[183:42.11]He keeps trying to get people to get this one.
[183:43.19]Not only does CDI have CD sound, it also plays music CDs as well.
[183:48.05]So what you guys have here is a machine that plays movies, games, multimedia titles, and music CDs all in one system.
[183:55.42]Not only that, CDI is a fraction of what some of those other machines cost.
[183:58.82]They're only like $300 to $500, and nobody wants them.
[184:01.31]Are they doing a Mike Myers nutty professor kind of thing here?
[184:04.07]Is he playing both characters?
[184:30.44]like they're doing the thing where you he gets out of the way they film the whole thing this way from the right side and then he then a guy on the right side gets out of the way and they do another whole thing that's it great these people these are my people who sold them their first extended warranty me
[184:51.79]Who sold them their second extended warranty?
[184:54.37]Me.
[184:54.93]No, it's the same guy.
[184:56.21]He's doing this thing.
[184:57.73]This is the hard thing about doing green screen stuff too.
[185:00.89]Is he's supposed to be looking here.
[185:03.77]And he's kind of looking like there.
[185:06.97]Like over here somewhere.
[185:08.80]Like through him.
[185:10.16]He's just looking right through him.
[185:11.88]And it's so difficult because you have to pretend that there's an actual person there.
[185:16.26]We fixing their VCR.
[185:18.08]Me.
[185:18.70]He's almost family.
[185:21.25]you hear that hey and have you seen this look at this this is great good acting this is Matt that's impossible you know the old west you and your trusty revolver outlaws everywhere you look hey quitting time hey nice shooting buddy hey you keep this up I gotta find a new line of work a minute with cdi and years yeah because he looks at the couch VCR me
[185:49.23]Hey, nice shooting, buddy.
[185:51.45]Hey, you keep this up.
[185:52.37]I got to find a new line of work.
[185:53.64]He gets up and he's still looking.
[185:54.74]A minute with CDI.
[185:56.16]And years of rivalry just disappeared.
[185:58.92]Maybe it was all the CDI titles.
[186:00.08]It's so hard.
[186:00.84]Don't even make fun of it.
[186:03.24]It's so fucking hard.
[186:05.10]What I just said, it's like making fun of somebody doing one of the hardest math problems in the world.
[186:10.95]You can just laugh at it.
[186:13.71]Look at his face.
[186:14.55]He's thinking really hard.
[186:15.91]Yeah, because this shit is hard.
[186:18.77]All I know is that now I have a partner.
[186:21.56]Better late than never.
[186:23.39]was good I like that now that you know what compact disc interactive has to offer it's clear why cdi is cd for your TV with cdi you'll experience full motion digital video with compact disc sound as big as your own television cdi does the work of a cd how come your last three streams all in one and it's yours for just eight payments of only 62.50
[186:48.74]How come they don't say, like, 40 payments of $3 or something?
[186:58.68]Would that work out?
[187:02.79]Like, 50 payments of $2.99.
[187:04.97]That's just too many.
[187:12.89]Is that that stupid, though?
[187:14.25]I feel like that would be kind of like
[187:22.63]People would like break them.
[187:26.08]What I was just going to say is, okay, what about one of the first payment?
[187:28.98]Kind of like a mattress.
[187:30.84]If you're not completely satisfied, you can even sleep on it for 90 whole days.
[187:35.84]You could sleep on it for three months and we'll come take it.
[187:38.42]Yeah, the reason why that works is because nobody wants to go through the bullshit of getting rid of another bed.
[187:43.42]Nobody wants a new bed.
[187:45.24]Nobody does.
[187:47.16]No one wants a new bed.
[187:49.04]So if when they get one in there, it's not coming out.
[187:54.23]That was the CDA.
[187:55.40]cdi offers over 200 titles like the cinematic adventure burn cycle there are educational discs like berenstain bears interactive music titles like Peter Gabriel's explorer one complete with digital video cartridge game controller and over 265 dollars of cdi's best titles all for just eight payments of only 62.50 call during this limited time offer and find out how it's like buying three switches today inexpensive cdi can be all of you
[188:28.78]Guys, TV.
[188:34.08]I like that one.
[188:34.52]That was a cool one.
[188:36.66]It was good stuff.
[188:38.60]Think about just the TV.
[188:42.02]Am I crazy to think that I remember TVs?
[188:45.36]Oh, 50-inch, 60-inch flat screen TVs 10, 15 years ago.
[188:50.12]Some of those were $6,000 to $7,000, $8,000 for like a 60-plus inch TV.
[188:58.94]TVs have come way down in price.
[189:02.00]It's kind of crazy, like the technology really kind of plateaued 5 to 10 years ago.
[189:07.57]And there are still a lot of improvements, but TVs were like 10 grand, right?
[189:14.21]Can you imagine like a $10,000, like a $9,000 TV 10 to 15 years ago?
[189:15.88]That's like, what, $15,000 to $20,000 right now?
[189:16.72]That's fucking ridiculous.
[189:27.70]cheaper to make now yeah but that's what I'm saying is cdi comes out I mean it was this stuff was new it was new tech it was new technology it was hard they had to solder this stuff somebody had to lean in with a face mask on early plasma tvs were 5 000 plus yeah it was expensive
[189:47.90]So they kind of were at that place where you just, you've got something that's such a brand new technology that's so expensive because it's so brand new and no one's ever seen anything like this before that you just price everybody out.
[190:01.47]It just sucks.
[190:03.71]It's unfortunate.
[190:12.13]Why are you defending the CDI?
[190:13.05]It was objectively terrible even when it came out.
[190:17.99]CDI, 3DO, all the... People had to make this stuff before PS2, PS1.
[190:26.25]They took notes.
[190:27.49]They were taking notes from each other.
[190:28.99]Everybody was trying to make something cool.
[190:30.27]Everybody was trying to do something interesting.
[190:32.49]Everybody was trying to just do something cool.
[190:35.19]We're going to make ours faster.
[190:36.69]We have blast processing.
[190:38.09]Wait a minute.
[190:38.43]What do you mean it's fucking Philips?
[190:40.67]They can play movies through this plastic box sitting on the... What do you mean they can play a movie out of that?
[190:48.05]You have to go to the theater to see a movie.
[190:50.66]Somebody get on that in R&D and fucking get me a player.
[190:53.22]What were we just talking about?
[190:56.72]This is called The Hawaii Chair.
[191:04.89]I don't know what this one is.
[191:11.51]Get the work out of your workout.
[191:15.72]The Hawaii Chair.
[191:19.84]You know, Tamara, the Hawaii chair wasn't designed just for home.
[191:23.86]I mean, after all, for some of us, at least 40 hours of our week is spent sitting behind a desk at the office.
[191:30.79]So to see what office workers think of the Hawaii chair, we sent Aaron Lee to work.
[191:35.85]Somebody find it for me.
[191:37.25]No, I'll find it.
[191:38.32]I'll find it.
[191:38.72]I don't give a fuck.
[191:40.64]I don't give a fuck.
[191:42.72]There was an old product where you laid down and you laid your back on the ground and you put your butt, it kind of cupped your butt and lower back.
[191:54.82]And you were supposed to put your feet up kind of at an angle like this, where your legs were like up on a bed.
[192:02.62]So your knees and your legs, your legs are bent.
[192:05.42]So you were kind of like sitting on the side of your bed.
[192:09.12]And there was this device that shook your ass.
[192:13.57]It went like this to you.
[192:14.61]It shook your hips and wiggled your hips and back and ass.
[192:18.43]And it was a spinal thing.
[192:21.09]And I remember looking at it and now I want it right now.
[192:25.17]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[192:27.56]What was that thing called?
[192:32.37]It was a thing, you put your butt in it and it would just like shake you around like this.
[192:37.31]And it was to unlock your spine.
[192:42.19]No, not the ass blaster.
[192:45.57]I remember this.
[192:46.15]Yeah, somebody that's over the age of 25 in here, 30, come on.
[192:52.06]The hula something?
[192:53.06]No, no, no, no, no way.
[192:55.96]It acted like this, but you laid on the ground.
[192:59.38]Saul from Better Call Saul has one.
[193:12.92]this is?
[193:13.60]You guys haven't even seen that show.
[193:20.82]No, you guys are getting this all wrong.
[193:25.67]The Chi machine?
[193:27.59]I don't think so.
[193:35.76]Alright, well, whatever.
[193:39.80]Okay, for a second I forgot what this product was and I thought she was just really excited or like really like ADHD or something.
[193:47.54]I'm like that.
[193:48.08]I thought he was just like that.
[194:09.91]Thanks, Aaron Lee.

[196:39.77]Are you talking about the Back to Life?
[197:00.24]The first thing that Jacqueline is going to show you is how to use the Back to Life correctly.
[197:10.40]Here is the easiest way to get into the machine.
[197:15.23]The first thing you will do is set it for your appropriate height.
[197:18.93]You can see the number right here in this little window.
[197:21.97]Push the big button in front and hold it as you adjust up or down for your height.
[197:27.93]Then let the button go.
[197:31.26]The easiest way to get onto the machine is just sit down and straddle your feet on both sides of this machine.
[197:37.99]Okay.
[197:40.71]Watch what this thing does.
[197:41.65]Now, lie comfortably on your back and move your buttocks as close to the machine as possible.
[197:50.08]Why did I think you were sitting at the end of a bed?
[197:52.56]Like Snoopy style.
[197:54.96]Like I thought that was the bed and your feet are on the bed and you're against the end of the bed, like the side of the bed.
[198:00.38]Either way, make sure that your buttocks are touching the base of the machine.
[198:05.12]Once you've done it a couple of times, this will be very, very easy.
[198:09.71]Now, as you're lying on your back, your lower back should be barely touching the ground.
[198:15.85]Turn the machine on and your lower back should gradually leave the floor just a little.
[198:22.33]at how awesome this thing is if you are coming far off the ground it like moves you around like pulls your spine around if you aren't leaving the ground it is set too low once you feel comfortable on the machine you've hit your sweet spot the next most important thing you have to do is nothing the more relaxed that you are the better the machine will work for you
[198:49.79]I wasted years trying to fix my low back pain following the... But that thing, uh, that's not what the commercial looked like.
[198:56.95]Wait a minute.
[198:59.15]The commercial was, like, way more, I want to say, like, aggressive and, like, violent.
[199:07.90]There's got to be speed settings.
[199:12.26]The amazing... Here it is.
[199:13.34]Here it... I got it.
[199:14.80]I got it.
[199:15.16]This is... Look at how much more aggressive this is.
[199:18.77]back to life focuses on the source of your back pain using a revolutionary product it actually eases your pain naturally this is the wrong product you just think I had the secret to back to ordinary results is a breakthrough technique called continuous passive motion oh is
[199:33.79]what you simply lay back in complete comfort and let the back to life gradually and gently ease your tight muscles making them flexible and supple as your muscles relax the continuous passive motion opens up compressed vertebrae and releases pressure on sensitive nerve endings the cartilage becomes flexible again and movement becomes easier the pain simply no this thing existed I'm telling you sit sleep walk
[199:57.98]Lift, even enjoy your favorite activities without the fear of excruciating pain.
[200:02.94]But that's just the beginning.
[200:04.24]The back to life gently and naturally guides your spine into proper and healthy alignment, which can improve posture and health to prevent injury.
[200:12.56]It releases the pressure to relieve the pain.
[200:15.63]So whether you're sitting hunched at a computer, if you're on your feet all day, if your back pain comes and goes, or even if you've suffered from nagging, aggravating back pain for the last 20 years, because I bet you it's that one.
[200:29.89]It's the Chi machine.
[200:31.03]Are you guys, am I looking to look up, what am I looking up here?
[200:40.24]No, it's not.
[200:43.35]No.
[200:45.87]It was way bigger than this.
[200:46.93]This thing is way too small.
[200:56.80]Hi, John Johnson here.
[200:58.44]I'm your online massage therapist with All About Massagers and the All About Health Network.
[201:03.34]I'm here today to let you have a live visual of all the different Qi machines.
[201:07.90]It has the widest range of motion from left to right.
[201:10.97]And I find that to be a strong, wider range of motion from left to right.
[201:16.05]And then it also goes from about 112 to 110.
[201:20.85]uh 60 rotations miles per hour that thing's fast and that's what that's the one is only one speed it's 147 rotations per minute it's got a nice timer that goes from zero up to 30. now I I like I said these look uncomfortable now that it would just like move and shake around your spine and make you feel like good and stuff you need to look in the mod chat right now
[201:51.22]This might be the one.
[201:51.88]I, I don't think this is, is this the right one though?
[201:57.50]Let me see.
[201:58.12]I don't, this thing looks, this is, it's, this cheat machine is small.
[202:07.79]The thing I'm thinking of was like a big ass machine.
[202:10.01]We'll watch it.
[202:16.04]Let's, let's, let's see.
[202:22.06]chi machine the chi machine is the culmination of 38 years of research and development by Dr shizuo inuo the way to keep healthy is to absorb oxygen in the air efficiently we need to follow the example of fish okay body swing gently no this this is it this is actually the best absorption of oxygen that's why we developed the chi machine I combined the two products
[202:48.83]But I want the first one to do more movement like that.
[202:52.65]Spinal misalignment, curvature, or deformity cause stiff, weakened muscles, nerve and circulatory problems, and organ under- I want to put it- I want to have that- I want to do- have that- do that to my, like, butt.
[203:09.12]In 1990, HTE, with its introduction of the cutting-edge first-generation Qi machine, immediately became a leader in their field.
[203:17.75]Nobody looks cool doing this.
[203:19.27]You're not gonna buy weed from a guy doing that.
[203:22.05]You know what I mean?
[203:23.89]You can't look cool doing that.
[203:25.07]Prove the Qi machine eliminates fluid and water retention for edema patients as well as improves body composition such as weight and body fat.
[203:47.32]It actually does the thing.
[203:51.82]Like a goldfish swimming, this is the best aerobic exercise available.
[203:56.14]Combining the muscles used in walking and swimming.
[203:58.96]Why is there a goldfish?
[204:00.07]Using the Qi machine equals 10,000 steps.
[204:03.49]Utilization of full spinal movement.
[204:06.15]The Qi machine can deliver the best possible lateral...
[204:09.07]10,000 steps.
[204:09.47]10,000.
[204:09.87]It takes me 20 minutes to do a mile on the treadmill.
[204:13.17]And that's 2,000.
[204:13.55]2,100 steps.
[204:29.49]old boring meal then you need the flavor pro the amazing new kitchen miracle that lets you make delicious meals until now marinating took hours not anymore simply pour your favorite marinade into the flexible flavorizer
[204:44.65]20 minute mile?

[204:47.99]Ugh.
[205:11.13]Well, you didn't have to do that.
[205:15.03]You didn't have to take it out and put it back in three times.
[205:17.67]You didn't have to do that.
[205:19.25]You could have just left it in that one time.
[205:21.46]What's up with that?
[205:22.42]Okay.
[205:22.70]Mmm.
[205:36.64]It's a hot pocket.
[205:37.92]It's an extra large.
[205:38.76]Butter hot pocket.

[206:03.78]kit and guidebook free decorate cakes like a professional imagine you get the deluxe flavor pro package which includes your bonus decorating kit all for only $19.99 order today that one was that was crazy I okay the concept of you know we just saw the burger ones you have a burger look of it's cheese filled burger I get it that's fine but something about this
[206:31.30]watching the turkey inflate.
[206:36.11]There's something ungodly about that.
[206:38.49]You know what I mean?
[206:39.17]There's something ungodly about what we just saw.
[206:48.52]Okay.
[206:50.67]This is the magic gate.
[206:52.50]It's a gate that you... It's like a baby gate or a doggy door or something.
[206:56.32]The only reason why I wanted to watch this one is because I'm just... Let's take a guess.
[207:01.52]Does a golden retriever in black and white just barrel through a screen door and break a bunch of stuff on a table?
[207:08.67]Or does a golden retriever get into some food that's on the table where they're trying to prevent and it's the shitty gate that's preventing them?
[207:16.52]I don't know.
[207:19.96]Most times, you want your dog with you.
[207:22.04]But sometimes, you need to keep them from running out of the house, running wild in the house, or jumping on your guests.
[207:28.85]Regular dog gates are awkward, heavy, and a real pain to try and climb over.
[207:33.55]Plus, they can ruin your walls.
[207:35.69]But now, there's Magic Gate, the ingenious new mesh gate that keeps your dog where you want him.
[207:41.02]Did they reverse?
[207:41.98]That was reversed footage.
[207:42.84]No problem at all.
[207:43.88]It's so easy.
[207:44.96]All you do is stick, unroll to the size you need, and then just hook.
[207:48.94]It's that simple.
[207:49.98]No nails, no screws, no damage.
[207:51.58]That was reversed.
[207:52.35]Magic Gate's patented mesh instantly creates a perfect barrier.
[207:55.89]But unlike traditional gates that you have to undo and move or risk climbing over to get where you want to go, with Magic Gate, you just lift and walk through.
[208:04.53]Best of all,
[208:05.27]You can use it anywhere you want.
[208:07.03]It even works on stairs.
[208:08.70]MagicGate uses four instant grip hooks that hold the mesh gate securely in place on all four sides, making the perfect barrier to keep your pet where you want them.
[208:17.72]MagicGate adjusts to fit any size opening or doorway up to six feet.
[208:21.67]Just roll up the extra length for a perfect fit.
[208:24.35]Regular gates can be an eyesore.
[208:26.43]I've come across a lot of golden retrievers.
[208:28.77]Jerma shepherds.
[208:29.21]You may as well not have put anything there.
[208:42.51]And can cost up to $95 and more.
[208:45.63]But you can get Magic Gate for just $14.99.
[208:48.99]In your choice of black or beige.
[208:50.89]Order right now and we'll double the offer.
[208:53.11]And give you a second Magic Gate as a bonus.
[208:54.85]No, I'm sorry.
[208:55.29]All it's going to take is somebody who says one of the dog's favorite words.
[208:59.40]And the wine is on the floor again.
[209:00.58]Go out, yeah.
[209:01.20]Woo!
[209:01.30]Okay, that was a cool one.
[209:12.50]uh big mouth masks does it come with the dogs yeah we didn't get a fine print that said if the dogs yeah I mean by the way I didn't say fine print on um on the on that one hold on I want to go back to that one uh
[209:31.86]There's no fine print because why do I not get the drinks, the lamp, the speakers over there, everything in her kitchen?
[209:41.99]How come I don't get that photo up there in the top left of that family?
[209:46.01]They didn't tell me I don't get that.
[209:47.53]They don't tell me I don't get the cabinets either on the right.
[209:50.17]These beautiful wooden cabinets.
[209:52.70]I don't get those.
[210:00.16]You need to move on.
[210:11.93]Hi everybody, Chef Tony here.
[210:13.89]Growing up, my family made the most amazing meatloaf, but we had a secret.
[210:18.75]Look, delicious seasoned beef on the outside, and oh boy, loaded baked... Oh, what?
[210:25.12]No, we don't want one of these.
[210:28.24]Meatloaf is so bad.
[210:29.86]Already.
[210:59.92]Meatloaf is so bad already.
[211:01.44]Do you guys think that if a chimpanzee was taught how to do meatloaf, do you think a monkey could make a better meatloaf than this?
[211:08.69]I think they would.
[211:24.56]I think if you trained a chimpanzee to cook, I think they would actually be able to make something better than this.
[211:31.01]And I'm talking about a monkey that does this five to ten times during the food preparation.
[211:46.03]turkey with Thanksgiving Day stuffing, or chicken with portabella mushrooms.
[211:51.01]You can also do cornbread, pull-apart cinnamon bread, even strawberry shortcake.
[211:56.03]Plus, it's all dishwasher safe.
[211:58.05]Other pans sell for up to $40, and they don't even have a lifting tray or easy press.
[212:03.25]But order right now, and all you'll pay is only $14.95.
[212:07.39]I'll even include my family's stuffing secrets, like Papa's stuffed peppers or Greek Isle stuffing.
[212:13.79]But to make this a Chef Tony-size offer,
[212:16.66]Chef Tony size.
[212:17.96]Is that bigger than a man size?
[212:20.08]Nice.
[212:20.24]This is the ham doggy.
[212:20.88]Ham doggy.
[212:46.30]oh my god that's so stupid tired of family barbecues being the same old boring meals hamburgers and hot dogs again and let's not I love that trying to match the number of more exciting with the awesome ham dogger you see the ham dogger takes ordinary hamburger meat and transforms it into a perfect hot dog shape
[213:05.71]It's the best of both worlds and totally fun to eat.
[213:09.23]The secret is the two-piece cylinder mold that transforms ground beef, ground turkey, or even veggies into fun and exciting hot dog shaped hamburgers.
[213:18.42]Simply place a quarter pound of meat into the ham dogger and it's that easy.
[213:22.82]In only minutes, you'll have the most unique barbecue treat on the block.
[213:26.64]It's a different and fun way to serve your hamburgers with a twist your guests will never expect.
[213:31.13]You'll be the hit of the barbecue.
[213:32.97]because there ain't nothing like a ham dog the ham dogger is great for the entire family and kids love the fun new way to help with the amazing ham dogger you'll never have to worry about mismatched buns again everything will fit perfectly in a standard hot dog bun and because hamburger meat has less sodium and nitrates than the traditional hot dog the ham dogger gives you a healthier alternative without losing the fun hot dog shape adding toppings inside
[213:58.93]I have to pause it.
[214:00.75]If you rewind the stream and you take a thumbnail from me looking really angry, it looks like I just am so fucking mad at this commercial.
[214:10.43]I was doing the chimpanzee thing again.
[214:12.03]Nobody even reacted, by the way.
[214:14.59]Nobody reacted at all.
[214:16.94]was so confusing to me I looked over at the chat and I just like there's no one's even reacting to this is that what how I act normally it's so normal to you guys that me like putting my fingers in my nose and like scratching my head and like making funny faces you guys are just like that that's normal that's what he does I was trying to be weird and apparently I I guess that's just the guy I am the ham dog this is a hot dog cheese and bacon inside I think this is a joke

[223:13.66]I mean, they kind of have to.
[223:16.90]It's effectively, it's a microscope for your eyes.
[223:20.70]A magnifying glass inside the lens.
[223:24.26]Actually kind of cool if you think about it.
[223:27.29]That's one of those things that's a really great idea.
[223:29.89]And everybody in the room can all say, wait a minute, why didn't I think of that?
[223:34.30]Yeah, just put little magnifying glass in there and put it closer or further away from your eye.
[223:38.58]Of course that would work.
[223:44.08]No two for one on that one.
[223:44.98]No, there wasn't.
[223:48.08]This one's a longer one too, but we can skip through this one.
[223:50.78]This one's called VCR Voice Recorder.
[223:52.98]I have absolutely no idea what this is.
[223:54.30]I just looked potentially interesting.
[223:57.69]for the VCR voice programmer preview the 21st century today voice recognition technology once only a fantasy is now a reality and can be utilized to prevent the personal humiliation facing 50 million americans answering machine well seinfeld sure was popular
[224:25.12]in the United States.
[224:26.52]At the latest count, six people know how to program them.
[224:31.23]And they're not talking.
[224:32.33]I'm not... Because I... I don't know how to program my VCR.
[224:38.01]The only thing that I have mastered so far is that I can get it to blink midnight whenever I want.
[224:44.49]Is yours blinking?
[224:45.07]Is yours blinking?
[224:46.18]I know.
[224:46.58]Okay, I'm going to tell you how to fix that blinking.
[224:49.02]Black electrical tape.
[224:50.83]Yep.
[224:52.21]Yeah, wow.
[224:52.98]He's speaking, he's speaking the truth.
[224:54.10]Right now.
[224:54.40]It's so easy, a chimpanzee could do it.
[224:55.80]Oh dear.
[225:20.84]A lot of comedians make fun of VCRs in their act.
[225:22.97]And you know why?
[225:23.97]Because they're an easy target.
[225:25.57]I mean, who would intentionally buy a $500 clock that's always flashing 12?
[225:29.69]And why do we have to read a manual the size of War and Peace to figure out how to record a movie?
[225:35.91]Well, forget about all that.
[225:38.01]Because what I'm holding here is going to change the way you watch television forever.
[225:42.82]From now on, whenever you want to program your VCR to tape something, you literally just say the word.
[225:49.22]Like this.
[225:50.60]Six.
[225:51.92]Thursday.
[225:53.69]8 p.m.
[225:55.25]What?
[225:55.97]10 p.m.
[225:58.15]That's all it takes.
[225:58.83]I just programmed my VCR.
[226:00.88]Now, I know this sounds unbelievable.
[226:02.24]It was to me when I first heard about it.
[226:03.88]But listen to this.
[226:05.84]Oh, I thought it was going to talk.
[226:08.84]He just wanted to stop his sentence and start a new one.
[226:10.78]Uh-oh, wait, wait, wait.
[226:11.35]He's affecting my TV.
[226:12.05]He's talking too loud.
[226:12.63]He's affecting mine.
[226:13.29]Oh, no, we're good.
[226:14.79]Okay.
[226:32.43]Oh, that one made me feel so stupid.
[226:34.73]So, if you want to change the channels, all you do is tell your VCR voice what channel you want.
[226:40.38]Five.
[226:42.16]Three.
[226:43.44]Seven.
[226:44.98]Nine.
[226:47.41]Three.
[226:49.44]It's that simple, you don't even have to point this at the TV.
[226:52.00]You just say it here and it happens there.
[226:54.00]You could press three.
[226:55.00]That's amazing and other people who tried the VCR voice can't get over how much it does either or how easy it is.
[227:01.00]Three, three... it's the same- I mean it's really cool, it's new tech, that's why it was made. It's cool.
[227:09.00]I think the best thing about this is it doesn't scare you.
[227:13.00]It's simple if I can do it any kid can do it it's fun to talk to and see what it does.
[227:18.08]This uses a wonderful new technology called voice recognition.
[227:22.32]You have to admit it's pretty amazing.
[227:23.29]I'm going to pause it for a second here because for all of us to know, this is so funny.
[227:27.09]Think about that.
[227:27.61]I want you to really think about this.
[227:29.97]At some point throughout our human history, we became capable of having a rock, a shiny rock, come out of the ground.
[227:48.87]And remember what you told it.
[227:57.41]A rock remembers what you said.
[228:05.48]That's... You're living in a fucking magical world.
[228:09.86]Actually talk to your VCR and make it work.
[228:12.13]But it's true.
[228:13.31]The moment I see something I want to tape, anything, I just tell my VCR voice and it's done in seconds.
[228:19.25]Now, look, here's here's basic instinct.
[228:21.23]I know you want to take that one yourself.
[228:23.29]Alright.
[228:23.55]It's on Channel nine.
[228:24.43]Are you high?
[228:25.59]No tape.
[228:26.17]But all I do is say nine Wednesday, eight p.m., 10 p.m.
[228:37.53]and a bunch of rocks strung together that came out of the ground and metal and shit just did that.
[228:42.53]You can program your VCR and build a tape library of everything you want to see and keep.
[228:47.61]Because the VCR voice takes command of your whole video system, just by voice.
[228:52.53]Now, of course, you can use your VCR voice manually, just like a regular remote, but once you get hooked on the amazing power of voice activation, you'll never want to go back.
[229:00.84]Look, it controls your VCR with simple commands, like play.
[229:06.12]Now, you think that's cool.
[229:07.36]Watch this.
[229:08.68]Pause.
[229:10.06]Fast forward.
[229:11.52]Play.
[229:12.81]See, for every VCR function, you just say the word and it happens.
[229:16.96]oh I almost forgot here's a feature that'll make Madison avenue very nervous but it's a feature I happen to love when you come to a commercial you've recorded just say zap it and your VCR automatically fast forward through 60 seconds of tape the commercial is gone it's out of here zappa the other VCR voice functions are controlled by a remote so powerful it works from clear across the room watch
[229:41.55]Susan, this is my friend Susan.
[229:45.51]Stop.
[229:46.05]That's what I came for.
[229:47.13]I want to record myself.
[229:50.07]Susan, I have some friends here right now.
[229:51.93]It's not a good time.
[229:53.79]Oh, hello.
[229:54.33]Hey, hi.
[229:54.95]We're joining for a few hours or an hour or so.
[229:57.22]She likes to borrow it because it can recognize up to four different voices.
[230:00.40]Hey, you've got quite the television here, by the way.
[230:03.34]It's so handy.
[230:04.70]I can set it to record...
[230:06.56]Daily shows like All My Children and Donahue.
[230:09.58]Or weekly shows.
[230:10.26]You could record Murphy Brown every Monday night forever.
[230:12.65]Or the weather.
[230:13.53]The weather is what I would do it for.
[230:16.51]Thanks, Ross.
[230:17.81]Look, the VCR voice has this great display to help you out.
[230:21.15]See, it shows my name, Susan, because it's programmed for my voice.
[230:25.95]It also shows the day and time.
[230:28.25]So you can forget about the blinking light on your VCR because the clock is inside the VCR voice.
[230:32.34]Do you mind?
[230:33.22]The display also shows all the programs that are stored.
[230:36.86]See, I can review all the days and times I've set to record.
[230:40.52]As many as 15 shows.
[230:41.80]It also tells me if I try to program two shows at the same time.
[230:46.18]Best of all the VCR voice tells me to put a tape in the VCR when one of my shows Yeah, like you put it in the VCR and you can record it.
[230:54.87]Yeah, remember how I used to try to program the VCR I could never remember Wow, would you go to where'd you go to school?
[231:04.01]We've never recorded with our VCRs because it was always such a hassle until now until the VCR voice.
[231:11.15]Thank you.
[231:11.53]Oh
[231:14.54]One reason the VCR voice does so many things so easily is that it was developed by someone who couldn't program his VCR either.
[231:21.03]See, Michael Bissonnette is an entrepreneur who saw a tremendous opportunity.
[231:24.96]With good old-fashioned American ingenuity, he solved his problem.
[231:28.14]And ours.
[231:30.49]I can't program my own VCR.
[231:32.41]No, I'm not stupid.
[231:33.69]In fact, I'm the president of my own company.
[231:36.03]But do you know that eight out of ten of us can't program our own VCRs?
[231:39.45]It was obvious to me that this was a problem screaming for a solution.
[231:42.97]So I decided to do something about it.
[231:45.27]I brought in the country's top engineers, and I've spent the last two years working on the most advanced voice recognition technology in the world.
[231:52.88]We incorporated something called artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic, and we put it all on this single, incredible computer.
[231:59.62]Oh, no, what have you done?
[232:00.88]What did you do?
[232:01.92]What did you do?
[232:02.56]What did you do?
[232:03.14]The secret behind our VCR voice programmer.
[232:05.20]Now, literally, anyone that can speak can program their VCR in seconds.
[232:09.83]It really is just that simple.
[232:11.85]Robots are coming.
[232:14.47]It's because he wanted to record his fucking soap opera.
[232:17.51]It's the first and only device of its kind.
[232:20.17]And I really believe it's going to give you the freedom to enjoy TV like you never have before.
[232:25.15]The fact is, demand for the VCR voice has been sensational.
[232:28.98]I thought that sounded like it wasn't going to be good.
[232:32.48]I'll be back in a minute to show you a whole lot more about what the VCR voice can do.
[232:37.72]So stay right there.
[232:39.41]This one is not that I'm very uninterested and very interested in this one at the same time.
[232:44.77]Should we skip through it?
[232:48.25]To Monday, 9pm.
[232:56.02]1130pm.
[232:58.24]Monday Night Football.
[233:00.40]Ah, stay tuned.
[233:01.56]You see, you see, I'm a loser.
[233:02.82]I don't I don't play sports or know anything about them.
[233:04.94]So you're you invited a loser into your house.
[233:07.98]You want to talk about Warcraft?
[233:08.98]I love that game.
[233:10.46]World of Warcraft.
[233:20.46]of hey it actually works thanks hi I'm jan and I'm taking calls from people like you who are ordering the latest development in home entertainment the VCR voice programmer you know I talk to a lot of people in my job but between you and me I have never heard people rave like they are over the performance of their VCR voice programmer and that really caught my attention I
[233:42.26]I mean, when it comes to programming my VCR the old way, I'm hopeless.
[233:46.32]So I ordered a VCR voice for myself.
[233:48.46]And you know what?
[233:49.56]It really is as amazing as everyone is saying and simple.
[233:52.57]Speed it up.
[233:52.99]I mean, there are no wires or anything to install.
[233:55.37]You just follow the easy setup instructions and you're ready to program.
[233:59.03]There's even a free video included to make it simple to get started.
[234:02.48]But I know, like most people who call, you're thinking that something this high tech would have just as high a price tag.
[234:08.64]So you wouldn't be surprised at all to hear that it costs at least $500.
[234:10.92]But the VCR voice was invented so it would be affordable now to people like you and me.
[234:17.64]So you don't have to pay $500.
[234:18.54]Why does it feel like this is working but not working?
[234:21.25]True.
[234:21.47]Half the fun of playing WoW is manipulating other people to play it too.
[234:44.45]The VCR voice comes ready to learn your voice with a free demonstration video to make it easy to get started.
[234:48.79]The VCR voice comes with a manufacturer's one-year warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee.
[234:52.86]So call now with your credit card ready to have your very own VCR voice delivered right to your door.
[234:56.78]Or send check or money order for the full amount to the address shown.
[234:59.06]Order now.
[234:59.50]Sorry, no CODs.
[235:02.49]I look like a fairly smart person.
[235:05.77]I think I should be able to program a VCR.
[235:08.13]So I do what I said I would never do.
[235:09.25]I read the manual.
[235:10.71]Well, you've seen these manuals.
[235:11.97]My manual's a little bit thicker than my VCR.
[235:13.17]So when I get through it, and I finally get to the section which they call troubleshooting, under the heading, won't record programs.
[235:17.81]On mine, it says, before attempting to record a program, repeat the 10th grade.
[235:23.91]Alright.
[235:25.45]Let's skip around this one.
[235:28.78]I'm not bored by this one.
[235:30.22]I'm very interested.
[235:30.88]But I feel like we're going to get the same 11 minutes of content again.
[235:36.32]We'll see.
[235:38.40]Because they did that.
[235:39.50]They would do three, two or three, 11 minutes.
[235:44.40]The VCR voice programmer.
[235:46.40]Just say the word and it programs for you.
[235:49.26]Here we go.
[235:49.66]We're in a new place.
[235:51.53]Rewind.
[235:52.07]No, it's a... Yeah, same.
[235:53.47]You know, what makes jokes about VCR so funny is that there's so much truth in them.
[235:57.13]I mean, you and I have spent a lot of money on these things.
[235:59.33]And if we don't use them to record movies and shows, we're just not getting what we paid for.
[236:03.57]That's what I love about the VCR voice.
[236:05.84]With this incredible new technology, we can forget about constantly going back to these big mantles.
[236:09.80]Hold on.
[236:10.06]There's like a brother-in-law that shows up.
[236:15.35]The thing is, with the VCR voice, you're in control.
[236:18.14]Nod zapping it.
[236:18.72]Not before the brother-in-law.
[236:21.84]Thanks.
[236:23.30]Hi, Howard.
[236:24.30]Hey.
[236:24.76]This is my next-door neighbor, Howard.
[236:27.04]Oh, hi.
[236:28.46]Gonna tape a ball game.
[236:30.01]Why is it messed up?
[236:30.93]I was just telling my friends about...
[236:36.01]Hi, Howard.
[236:36.87]Hey.
[236:37.05]This is my next door neighbor, Howard.
[236:38.95]Wait, what happened to the step-by-step instruction in this thing?
[236:41.76]This is a prize.
[236:43.04]Because it's a universal remote, it can re-
[236:46.80]9 p.m.
[236:48.94]Oh, it's out of sync in the second half.
[236:51.91]One of the best things about the VCR voice is that it's also a universal remote.
[236:56.01]Hey, Howard, remember all those remotes I used to use?
[236:58.81]Yeah, I had one for my TV, had one for my cable box, had one for the VCR.
[237:03.31]I had another one around here somewhere.
[237:04.55]I don't know.
[237:05.40]Oh, yeah, thanks, Howard.
[237:06.30]The VCR Plus.
[237:07.46]See, I don't need that or its little code numbers anymore because this replaces them all.
[237:12.22]The Kramer is crazy.
[237:13.36]It is Kramer.
[237:13.88]Are we going to get a George and a Lane?
[237:15.16]Okay, I'm out of here.
[237:15.80]Duct tape magic.
[237:16.58]Duct tape magic.
[237:37.75]introducing duct tape magic it takes the magic of duct taping and puts it into large sheets so now you can do so much more by creating any shape any size the duct tape magic kit also includes these glow in the dark duct tape sheets so when the lights go out your designs glow in the dark decorate your backpack and have it glow in the night or make a spooky t-shirt and give your brother a fright try that with duct tape rolls
[238:02.04]Creating with duct tape can be a sticky chore.
[238:05.02]Too hard to cut shapes.
[238:06.38]After a while, it becomes a bore.
[238:08.58]Is creating with duct tape that thing that people are doing a lot of?
[238:12.90]Arts and crafts with duct tape.
[238:15.61]Duct tape magic even comes with a peel-off adhesive backing.
[238:18.65]Now you can cut it, peel it, stick it, stack it, or even overlap it.
[238:22.83]Cover books and notebooks with a new kind of flair, or take that old purse from drab to fab.
[238:28.43]With duct tape magic, anything ordinary can become extraordinary in just minutes.
[238:33.56]Something for mom, something for grandma too.
[238:36.66]And don't forget your pets.
[238:38.22]With duct tape magic, you can make his bowl extra bright, or give him a glowing collar for safety at night.
[238:44.74]Duck Tape Magic Kit comes with two 8x12 glow-in-the-dark duct tape sheets with peel-off backing.
[238:50.51]Four 8x12 colored duct tape sheets with peel-off backing.

[238:55.33]And one roll of narrow glow-in-the-dark duct tape.
[238:57.97]You get all this for $14.95.
[238:58.93]Just pay additional postage and handling.
[239:02.65]And that's not all.
[239:04.13]Included in your Duck Tape Magic Kit are also two sheets of stencils.
[239:09.34]No, I keep thinking about this.
[239:11.58]It's gonna...
[239:12.46]This is going to stick with me for the next like week.
[239:14.22]I'm going to be in the shower like three days from now thinking about the guy that got the plug for like a present.
[239:18.50]And it was like a stray four plug outlet cable.
[239:25.91]It's just like that's the worst fucking present I've ever heard.
[239:35.55]Right now, if you guys were to go around your whole house, your whole apartment, whatever, how many outlet plugs do you think you have?
[239:44.95]More than 10?
[239:46.07]More than 20?
[239:46.73]Like, nobody needs one of those right now.
[239:50.63]I probably have all the streams that have happened, all the different devices, all the different plugs I've had to have available at any given time.
[239:59.76]I probably have 20 or 30 of those at any given moment.
[240:03.40]That's not even fucking true.
[240:08.95]That is an unbelievable number of them.
[240:11.87]I think I have five.
[240:15.25]I don't have 20.
[240:16.07]No, dude, that's way too many.
[240:17.87]I have like one, two, three, four, five, six.
[240:22.65]Maybe like seven?
[240:23.37]I don't need another one.
[240:26.51]And let's also be honest, too.
[240:29.26]That was a generic ass, just kind of like a white plug.
[240:35.74]That's an insurance fraud setup?
[240:41.20]They're not going into each other.
[240:42.58]That's not what I said.
[240:44.87]And to make sure you have enough sheets to continue decorating, we'll include two additional 8x12 glow-in-the-dark duct tape sheets and four additional 8x12 colored duct tape sheets.
[240:53.73]I have like 10 broken ones, so I gotta gamble.
[240:56.39]Oh my god, dude.
[240:57.33]Be careful with that shit.
[240:59.17]Hey, something I've always been told is don't fuck with electricity.
[241:05.90]Or call the number on your screen today.
[241:09.84]Yeah.
[241:10.55]My dear old dad said one time, hey, Jeremy, if you ever learn anything, anything at all, don't fuck with electricity.
[241:19.29]Okay.
[241:20.86]Whoa.
[241:22.40]Dad, you got it.
[241:23.48]Nope.
[241:24.06]I will not.
[241:26.14]You call somebody for that.
[241:34.01]this is kind of in the same realm this is static magic I think we're almost through these ones static magic holds it all it's static magic the fun new way to show off all the stuff you make love and want to save static magic's mounting power is fueled by the fun one supercharged static capacitor
[241:54.14]Don't fuck with electricity.
[241:55.26]I didn't do that part.
[241:57.40]I didn't.
[241:58.20]I can't buy this.
[241:59.08]My father will be pissed at me.
[242:17.19]I don't get this.
[242:17.77]I don't get it.
[242:18.25]What is this thing?
[242:19.45]Is it a cat?
[242:37.12]You control the crowd, holiday favorites, memory makers, cutouts and doodles, very funny picture boodles, sports team logos.
[242:42.45]Yes, anything goes.
[242:44.25]Whatever you want to save and see.
[242:46.17]Static magic with hold and key.
[242:48.27]Decorate your room again and again without any mess or commitment.
[242:52.06]Is it like that?
[242:52.60]Use any smooth surface.
[242:54.00]Just zap, roll, and stick it on.
[242:56.54]Walls, mirrors, windows, cabinets, school lockers, headboards, and more.
[243:02.37]You can color log on.
[243:05.25]What is he saying genuinely?
[243:06.91]Um, he's saying... No, I can't do it.
[243:12.51]Because it'll make too many of you happy.
[243:15.51]We can't have that.
[243:19.69]Uh, Plumber's Hero.
[243:23.44]Hi, Mark Gill here with Plumber's Hero, the one product plumbers don't want you to see.
[243:27.87]Just press and unclog the mess.
[243:30.17]Watch again as Plumber's Hero completely annihilates the clog.
[243:33.95]It's that easy.
[243:35.07]Sneaking your drain is nasty.
[243:36.75]Calling a plumber is expensive.
[243:38.48]And if there's water on the floor, you can't wait anymore.
[243:41.34]Just press and unclog.
[243:42.52]Unplug the mess.
[243:43.46]Plumber's Hero uses a unique formula that when combined with water, uses that water as force to jet propel it through virtually any fog.
[243:51.21]It's safe for your pipes, unlike those harmful chemicals that even make you wait up to eight hours.
[243:55.97]It even works right through a garbage disposal.
[243:58.09]Check this clog out.
[243:59.25]Veggie shavings, rice, grease, and coffee ground.
[244:01.77]Would this fire an underwater missile if you did it?
[244:06.78]This thing looks very, very strong.
[244:09.70]With Plumber's Hero, you just press and unclog the mess.
[244:13.89]Bathroom clogs are the worst.
[244:15.47]Hair ties, toothpaste, shaving gel, and hair.
[244:18.29]But it's still no match for Plumber's Hero.
[244:20.62]And it's so easy to use, anyone can do it.
[244:23.12]Hit it, Mom.
[244:25.34]Just press and unclog the mess.
[244:27.52]Plumber's Hero has a shelf life of over 10 years.
[244:30.09]It's great for toilets, sinks, tubs, and shower drains, and works on all pipes.
[244:34.93]There's never a convenient time for a clog, so don't let it ruin your plans.
[244:38.85]Reach for your own plumber in a can.
[244:40.71]At an average cost of over $150 a visit by a plumber, you can spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars a year unclogging toilets and drains.
[244:48.42]With over 20 uses per can, Plumber's Hero will take that money... Also, can I say something, too?
[244:54.32]Wow, man.
[244:56.06]What a group of people that just get typecast and stereotyped as this guy.
[245:02.15]You know what I'm saying?
[245:03.59]I have come across probably 10 plumbers in my life.
[245:07.03]Honestly, probably some of the more fit people I've ever fucking come across.
[245:12.61]They don't look like this.
[245:14.98]I've had like three plumbers in my residences over the last four to 10 years.
[245:22.94]They don't look like this.
[245:28.67]You have to blame Mario for that.
[245:29.77]He's got like the cap on.
[245:34.45]He's like, I got I'm gonna have to charge you like fucking 10 grand for this.
[245:37.67]Oh, we already saw Harry the hyena.
[245:38.69]I don't know why it's on here again.

[247:49.93]Wouldn't you, don't you need to do this once and then it's gone for, do people have a ton of body and back hair that just comes back immediately?
[248:02.87]Hair grows back.
[248:03.57]Yeah, but how fast?
[248:04.57]Does it grow back that fast?
[248:05.69]Do you need like two months?
[248:08.88]What is a serving of this?
[248:10.22]What is one serving of this?
[248:11.66]How many ounces?
[248:13.66]How much do you need to lather into your back?
[248:14.98]Because I imagine you would only do this like once or twice a month.
[248:20.08]Chat's full of shit.
[248:20.74]They have no idea.
[248:21.82]I imagine so.
[248:26.90]Depends on how big your back is too.
[248:28.90]Yeah.
[248:32.91]I would use this once and all my hair would never come back.
[248:44.61]I'm one of the, I'm one of those dudes that, that their hair grows.
[248:47.74]Like it would take me probably 10 years to look like that.
[248:55.44]That's it would look like that in a decade.
[249:02.40]What do you mean how?
[249:04.57]I don't really grow a bunch of hair on my back or my chest.
[249:08.11]Maybe a little bit on my chest.
[249:09.41]Not really.
[249:11.03]I barely can grow facial hair here.
[249:12.69]I just did this to, you know, make everybody sick.
[249:16.78]I can't do facial hair.
[249:18.80]Let me get a look.
[249:19.30]Let me get it.
[249:19.68]Let me get it.
[249:27.07]There we go.
[249:28.19]Alright.
[249:28.43]That was that one.
[249:29.11]Oh, we made it to the end.
[249:35.11]We were having so much fun too.
[249:42.38]Four hours and 10 minutes of commercials.
[249:45.72]So he's going to say it.
[249:49.44]He's going to go.
[249:49.98]He's going to say goodbye.
[249:53.67]I'll see you guys later.
[249:55.52]That's a pretty good place to stop, I think.
[249:57.82]Four hours of this?
[249:59.64]I was going to do like two and then play that Infinity Nikki game, but I got two.
[250:06.98]No, commercials always take precedence over everything.
[250:11.81]When should I stream next?
[250:13.37]It's the new year.
[250:13.95]What do we got here?
[250:14.75]I don't know.
[250:23.97]Maybe...
[250:29.36]I'm just visualizing everything I have to do next week okay uh hey how about Friday how about how about Friday the 10th next next weekend Friday the 10th sound good that sounds good to me um I want to do should I play this Infinity Nikki game should I actually play it is it actually fun
[250:58.82]Can we get a poll?
[251:00.47]There's 18,000 people here.
[251:02.53]And I want you to vote on this.
[251:06.91]Is this game fun?
[251:07.87]Do you really want to see me play this?
[251:12.79]Maybe get a poll going.
[251:16.88]Because there's people in chat right now that are like, yeah, yeah, yeah, but how many are just like, dude, don't play it.
[251:21.06]Let's see.
[251:30.16]Okay.
[251:33.06]I don't think you'll enjoy it.
[251:36.80]Whatever.
[251:37.16]I'm game for whatever.
[251:42.28]Also, new year.
[251:48.96]Might be some fun thing coming up.
[251:53.23]Couple months, maybe.
[251:56.79]Something fun.
[251:58.95]Something fun.
[252:01.41]Something fun?
[252:07.38]Yeah?
[252:14.10]I can't.
[252:14.66]No, I don't know.
[252:15.90]But something fun.
[252:17.79]I actually might be doing something fun.
[252:20.61]And I think you're all going to like it because it's something that we enjoy.
[252:26.67]But yeah.
[252:27.75]Alright, I'll play this.
[252:28.75]I'll play Infinity Nikki.
[252:30.15]I need to give myself like a two hour time limit.
[252:32.07]So it needs to be the last two hours of the stream.
[252:33.82]So I need something else to do for like two or three hours.
[252:37.06]Because if I like it, then okay, then I like it.
[252:38.98]And maybe I'll play it again.
[252:47.96]What about MS-DOS games?
[252:49.04]I have a lot of old PC games I still haven't played.
[253:02.46]Did you play Balatro?
[253:03.84]I've played a lot of Balatro and I feel the same way about Balatro that I do about Hearthstone.
[253:08.16]Remember when I tried to play Hearthstone on stream and I just kept asking you guys about every play I did because I just didn't have the confidence to be confidently wrong in front of all of you?
[253:17.93]To a point of embarrassment because, oh, I'm doing this wrong.
[253:20.77]And I missed damage on the character on the left and somebody else didn't know.
[253:25.01]How did you miss that?
[253:26.62]Um...
[253:28.26]When I don't stream a game like that, I can just look behind me and go, there's nobody here.
[253:33.24]I can make as many dumb mistakes as I want.
[253:44.00]Do emote only Balatro.
[253:48.50]That actually is kind of funny.
[253:53.02]That sounds like a personal problem.
[253:54.56]It is.
[253:55.10]That's exactly what I'm telling you.
[254:02.97]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[254:04.43]Thanks for watching.
[254:05.19]Thanks for hanging out.
[254:07.01]See you next week.
[254:07.67]See you on Friday.
[254:10.06]Hope you have a good new year.
[254:11.18]Let's make this year good.
[254:13.68]Let's make this year good.
[254:17.74]I'm not, I'm not asking for anything crazy.
[254:20.40]I just want this year to be good.
[254:22.92]Let's be a good one.
[254:23.72]You know what I mean?
[254:29.90]Alright.
[254:30.18]Take it easy.
[254:30.66]Take care.
[254:31.82]Have a great night.
[254:33.28]See you later.
[254:54.27]Oh, and call your mother.
[254:58.78]New Year's Day was yesterday.
[255:03.19]Call your mother.
[255:05.53]It's New Year's.
[255:06.35]Are you serious?
[255:06.99]Bye-bye.
