[00:08.60]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.52]Jeremiah here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Scout with the Soda Popper, which we'll get to in a second.
[00:21.38]The Soda Popper.
[00:22.38]Also gonna be using the Mad Milk and the... What is the melee item?
[00:26.20]Oh my god, I think the fish.
[00:27.79]No, it's not.
[00:28.23]It's the candy cane.
[00:29.43]Okay.
[00:31.45]And if you saw the video from last night, I just got back from PAX East.
[00:36.95]And I'll reiterate this a couple of more times, and I'll tell you a little bit about the trip, because I only just introduced that last video, but guys, it was amazing.
[00:44.88]If you are ever on the fence of taking a trip somewhere, going to a gaming convention, even if it's not a gaming convention...
[00:52.11]Even if you're talking if it's an anime convention or if it's a technology convention or something, if you're thinking of going to one of these things, don't think and just do it.
[01:00.52]Because I met a lot of people there.
[01:02.16]I met a lot of friends there.
[01:03.92]It was just awesome.
[01:04.70]We all hung out.
[01:05.52]You're all in a collective group of people that have the exact same interest.
[01:10.02]So it's really easy to fit in, really easy to get along with anybody that's there.
[01:13.99]So really don't hesitate.
[01:15.33]Do not hesitate with stuff like this.
[01:17.03]If you want to do it, go for it.
[01:18.91]You will not regret it.
[01:20.47]And that brings me to something else.
[01:22.75]And I never really did conventions.
[01:24.59]I never really got into them.
[01:25.99]But I want to do more.
[01:27.87]I want to attend more of these things.
[01:29.93]And I really think I'm going to seriously, seriously consider going to PAX Prime.
[01:35.49]And PAX Prime is the one in the summertime.
[01:37.31]I believe it's in Seattle, Washington.
[01:40.22]And maybe, maybe I can get like a...
[01:42.56]YouTube meetup or a friend meetup or something like that.
[01:45.54]We can actually plan it next time.
[01:47.18]Because I know in PAX, I kind of just told you guys, at least PAX East, I was like, hey, I'm going Saturday.
[01:52.43]Okay, cool, bye.
[01:54.60]But how cool would it be if I got in contact with guys like Shibby.
[01:59.44]I'm calling all you guys out right now, by the way.
[02:01.76]Like Shibby, Boo, Stealth.
[02:04.18]If we could all get everybody over to a hotel somewhere in Seattle, and we could just have a grand old time.
[02:10.06]So I'm calling all you guys out.
[02:11.31]If you want to go to PAX Prime, this is the sign-up sheet.
[02:16.43]No, but you get the idea.
[02:17.67]That would be really interesting.
[02:18.61]It would be fun.
[02:19.81]And I think that next time I'm going to really try to plan a meetup.
[02:23.21]Because it didn't really work out so well in this particular PAX.
[02:26.43]I want to actually get a set time and date where people could actually meet up in the same area.
[02:31.53]We could all have a really set schedule.
[02:33.43]Because I'll tell you right now, at least at this one, I went there with Burgah Boy and I lost him like three times.
[02:39.64]It wasn't because I didn't like him.
[02:41.24]I mean, I love Burgah Boy.
[02:42.68]Who doesn't love Burgah Boy?
[02:44.34]But there was like 100,000 people there.
[02:46.58]So it can be really difficult to stay with the people you're with, even.
[02:50.84]But we will wait until a little later to talk about that, because obviously PAX Prime and even things like E3, those are not until the summertime.
[02:58.97]So we've got at least a few months to kill before that discussion happens.
[03:03.81]So the Scout, let's start talking about what the setup I'm using and why I'm using it and all that jazz, all that jazz flute.
[03:11.11]So the Scout with the Soda Popper, you run around, you get the mini-crits, you put the mini-crits into people's faces and you get kills.
[03:17.76]Now most people will use the pistol with this setup, because obviously you can switch and use the mini-crits on the pistol,
[03:24.12]But this is actually a pretty good setup.
[03:26.50]If you use the Mad Milk, think about it like this.
[03:29.40]When you mini-crit somebody and they're covered in milk, you're going to be healed for a lot more than you would typically if they didn't have the milk on them.
[03:36.79]So what you're going to want to try and do is get those mini-crits and get the milk out at the same time.
[03:43.09]Now that can be pretty difficult because as we know, the milk is used for a lot of other things.
[03:47.79]Putting out teammates, putting yourself out, trying to save yourself from death.
[03:52.05]But if you do get these both out at the same time, you are going to be able to negate any damage you receive, especially if it's a one-on-one fight.
[04:02.64]Because with the mini-crits, you're going to be healed 60% of course of any damage you do.
[04:07.29]So if somebody shoots you with a shotgun, and you mini-crit them with the Mad Milk on, say hello to pretty much all the health you just lost from the shotgun shot.
[04:16.82]The only case where I'd say you're in trouble regardless is if it's a soldier shooting a rocket launcher at you and you get insta-gibbed.
[04:23.94]Or, of course, if it's a Demoman or something like that.
[04:26.18]But you get the idea.
[04:27.12]It makes things a little easier to stay alive.
[04:30.25]Now, I'm not a real expert on this technique.
[04:32.26]I just really started trying to do it the other night.
[04:35.40]And it is kind of difficult to keep these two things in sync.
[04:38.70]Because at one point you're going, okay, hold on, I gotta bring out something else.
[04:42.46]Here comes my mini-crits.
[04:43.66]Oh, good, but here comes a pyro.
[04:44.64]I don't want to die.
[04:45.27]I don't want to be lit on fire.
[04:46.39]And you're kind of, both sides of your brain are attacking each other, trying to fight for logic.
[04:52.97]But this is going to be the end of the video, guys.
[04:55.75]Thank you so much for watching.
[04:57.01]I really do appreciate it.
[04:58.59]I get on the top of the scoreboard, which hasn't happened in a while.
[05:02.44]So that was a good feeling.
[05:04.88]But yeah, I'll catch you guys all soon.
[05:07.08]And take care, everybody.
