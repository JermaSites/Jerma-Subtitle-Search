[00:01.55]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.66]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:09.42]Why'd they take it away?
[00:10.20]That like freezer door.
[00:11.32]Alright, I guess we're starting.
[00:13.64]Let's go.
[00:15.14]Oh, that's a quad.
[00:16.12]Hey, let's go back to the safe house.
[00:17.80]Everyone back into the safe room.
[00:19.20]Oh, the door can't close.
[00:20.16]Oh, we can't close it.
[00:21.48]Whatever.
[00:22.86]Get badger, get badger.
[00:23.80]Don't worry, dude.
[00:24.27]I'm going to win the war myself.
[00:25.55]I'll get it.
[00:26.67]Get him.
[00:27.45]Come here, Mass.
[00:28.33]Sexy time with shibs.
[00:29.47]Oh, Russian badger?
[00:30.15]You got hit?
[00:31.71]Dude, I'm getting them.
[00:32.53]I'm getting them really hard, dude.
[00:34.55]So hard.
[00:36.03]So hard.
[00:37.27]Yep, yep, yep.
[00:38.41]So hard.
[00:39.61]Uh-oh, somebody's down over there.
[00:48.44]Better go rescue them.
[00:49.62]Oh, man.
[00:50.12]Metallics, hit that.
[00:51.52]Hit that.
[00:52.48]I already used it.
[00:53.89]It's already been used.
[00:56.23]Oh, man.
[00:58.53]I should have saved it for five more seconds.
[01:00.87]The 25-point pounce.
[01:02.91]That's like the 1080 no-scope of Left 4 Dead.
[01:06.07]I hope you know once I die.
[01:07.53]The 25-point pounce.
[01:08.33]Come on, everyone over together.
[01:12.45]Mast is doing call-outs like he's playing Battlefield.
[01:14.57]Dude, call-outs are Call of Duty, alright?
[01:17.33]Battlefields don't have call-outs.
[01:18.45]Mast's too big.
[01:19.59]Yeah, considering I have a live commentary of you yesterday saying, good call-out, brah.
[01:23.50]Uh-oh, where are they going?
[01:27.68]That's also filled with racial slurs, so it's not even relevant.
[01:31.36]That's why I chopped it up.
[01:33.42]Oh, you chopped it up?
[01:34.22]Wow!
[01:34.32]Someone's using a headset.
[01:37.97]That's an unfair advantage.
[01:39.55]Please go back to console.
[01:41.69]Oh, good spit, good spit, good spit.
[01:56.24]Oh, they're hopping up on the furniture to get away from the split.
[01:59.12]Not cool.
[02:01.30]Dude, the floor's lava.
[02:02.30]Got it.
[02:05.01]Don't need a trip, bro.

[02:26.61]Thank you, thank you.
[02:27.23]Mast, did you die?
[02:30.38]Oh, you don't want one of those, Mast.

[03:52.80]It's going down.
[03:55.18]No, no, no.
[03:56.16]Just say you think I want money and then set yourself on fire like a monk.
[04:02.79]Dude, you'd forever be a legend.
[04:05.07]That'd be so great.
[04:06.25]I'd probably sub for that.
[04:07.29]Probably not after that, though.
[04:09.05]Like, unless you do that, probably not gonna sub.
[04:10.68]What would, like, a grandpa cartoon network show even be?
[04:13.32]You've already subscribed to drama.
[04:15.30]And, like, taking a dump and, like, screaming at people?
[04:18.50]Dude, put a mine in some guy's pocket, wait till he runs into his, like, comrade's office, and then blow it up.
[04:27.43]That's the way you gotta do it.
[04:30.61]Hey, will you let like ADV guys leave to save him?
[04:33.13]No.
[04:33.87]Actually, I'm just like waiting on nothing.
