[00:08.35]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.03]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:13.76]And tonight, we've got a couple of things to discuss tonight.
[00:16.56]Well, first of all, there's a new update.
[00:18.84]And the new update brought a new sniper item.
[00:21.99]Kind of weird, in my opinion.
[00:24.31]Why did they do this?
[00:25.69]Why not just release a bunch of stuff?
[00:27.55]Why release one item?
[00:29.25]Just, oh, here's an item for the sniper.
[00:30.83]There you go.
[00:31.27]I don't know.
[00:32.33]I don't really agree with the item release schedule.
[00:35.34]But regardless of all that, we did get a new item, the Cozy Camper.
[00:41.04]And this is a backpack.
[00:42.56]This is not like a miscellaneous item.
[00:44.12]This is not like a hat or something.
[00:45.96]This goes right on your back where the Razorback, where the Darwin's Danger Shield goes.
[00:49.92]It's an unlockable, and it is craftable.
[00:52.82]So the blueprint's gonna be on the screen right now.
[00:55.18]It actually doesn't take very much.
[00:56.97]So you can probably craft this right now if you have the materials.
[00:59.83]But anyways, no flinching when aiming, and knockback reduced by 20% when aiming.
[01:05.20]So what this means is when you are zoomed in,
[01:08.26]you are not going to take flinching fire damage.
[01:10.33]Because all we all know, when you get lit on fire, I'll show you in a second here, when you get lit on fire, that tick, tick, tick, tick, it makes your mouse cursor move up and down really annoyingly.
[01:19.72]And when you get hit by anything, if you get hit by a rocket, if you get hit by spam, you're not going to move at all.
[01:26.20]Which brings me to the bad part of this weapon, 60% slower movement speed when you're aiming.
[01:32.51]So essentially when you have this thing zoomed in, you're a slug, and you cannot move really at all, and it really, really, really is very annoying.
[01:42.02]Especially, ESPECIALLY if there is another sniper on the enemy team.
[01:47.98]Cause when you're zoomed in with this thing, you almost stand completely still.
[01:53.15]And any sniper that's paying attention will be able to kill you so easily with this on.
[01:59.85]Not to mention spies, oh my god.
[02:02.97]You are just a spy magnet with this thing on.
[02:05.66]Cause it doesn't block anything, this does not block a backstab, this does not block anything.
[02:10.16]It just gives you the ability to not flinch when you're taking damage.
[02:15.24]Alright, so now that we got the bad out of the way, let's talk about the good.
[02:19.73]So what this thing does, this allows you to be a more aggressive sniper.
[02:24.92]You don't have to run away from fights anymore.
[02:26.78]You don't have to back up.
[02:28.30]Oh, he's getting too close.
[02:29.18]I got to run away.
[02:30.26]You don't have to do that anymore.
[02:31.86]Now you can just stand where you are and plant shots on people regardless of if they are shooting you or not.
[02:39.09]Because back in the day, and when I say back in the day, I mean yesterday before this update came out.
[02:44.99]You had to be really, really conscious of who was shooting you, because obviously it screwed up your aim.
[02:50.81]I can't tell you how many times I would be aiming as a sniper, and I would lose my aim because a scout 500 feet away was shooting me with a pistol or something.
[02:59.14]That is eliminated with this setup, and I suggest you try it.
[03:02.50]It doesn't take a whole lot to craft, like I said, so give it a go.
[03:05.84]So anyways, the next part of this video is going to talk about the Phlogistonator and the nerf it just received.
[03:12.26]And really, I don't agree with this nerf, and it's not because I don't think this weapon needs to be changed, because it really does.
[03:20.78]I just don't think you can slap minus 10% damage on something and go, okay, it's fixed.
[03:26.12]No, this thing needs to be totally redesigned.
[03:29.61]I think if you remove the taunt invincibility and change the crit mechanic a little bit, make it so it was, you know, 8 seconds rather than 12 or 10, because right now the nerf, I didn't even tell you the nerf, the nerf is minus 10% damage and 10 seconds of crit rather than 12 seconds of crit.
[03:45.86]Now that's great, but again, I said it's sort of a Band-Aid fix.
[03:49.12]They need to redo this weapon, change it completely, give it a compression blast, because I don't think the no compression blast works on any of the flamethrowers.
[03:57.33]It didn't work out well on the Backburner, and they got rid of it.
[04:00.93]So we'll see what they do.
[04:02.11]Hopefully they continue to tweak things, because they always do that anyway, so I'm confident in their tweaking abilities.
[04:08.82]So now before this video is over, I want to go over my TF2 modeling adventure I've kind of gone off on.
[04:15.11]Because I have got a couple of PMs.
[04:16.79]People are wondering, Germo, what's the story with your Steam Workshop stuff?
[04:20.43]Are you still doing that?
[04:21.73]The answer is yes, I am.
[04:22.93]I'm currently talking to a pretty talented guy.
[04:25.57]He's a nice dude.
[04:26.75]He already has a couple things on the workshop already.
[04:29.27]I'll get into that at a later date because I don't want to give away any of the potential information that we're working on.
[04:35.97]So yes, I have been in contact with a modeler, and I'll give you one hint.
[04:39.92]I'm going to give you guys one hint on what we're working on.
[04:42.50]It is not a weapon, and it is for the heavy.
[04:46.90]So there you go.
[04:47.56]Let the speculation run wild as to what I'm working on right now.
[04:52.18]So this is going to be the end of the video, guys.
[04:54.68]Thank you all so much for watching.
[04:56.64]I really do appreciate it, and I will see you guys all next time.
[04:59.76]So take care, everybody.
