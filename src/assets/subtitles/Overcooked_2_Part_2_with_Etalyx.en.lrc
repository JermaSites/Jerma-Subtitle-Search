[00:01.54]You know, let's try Overcooked.
[00:03.63]Just do, like, a few more.
[00:04.63]Let's just do that.
[00:05.49]Let's do a few more Overcooked rounds.
[00:07.35]I was having fun with Overcooked.
[00:09.11]Just finish.
[00:09.69]And it's co-op.
[00:10.95]Yeah.
[00:13.15]I feel like cooking.
[00:18.34]I feel like it will work because... I think they just had, like, a glitch in the server.
[00:23.20]Something weird was going on.
[00:24.78]I don't know.
[00:29.66]This is very loud.
[00:30.78]I didn't press A. Alright, let's try it again.
[00:38.34]And did it work?
[00:41.17]I don't think so.
[00:45.43]What's the dot in the corner?
[00:46.33]That's that weird face.
[00:47.43]Uh...
[00:58.52]Nah, it's not working.
[00:59.28]Something's going on weirdly with our connection through Steam.
[01:02.34]It's unfortunate.
[01:05.18]What's the problem?
[01:06.16]I can't connect to you.
[01:07.72]Still doing it.
[01:13.25]Um... It's gotta be something dumb.
[01:18.91]But what would have changed in the two or three hours?
[01:21.96]We were playing fine.
[01:40.10]Just invite him.
[01:41.04]It doesn't work.
[01:42.17]We can't do it.
[01:43.85]I'll try and invite you.
[01:45.07]So, I'm creating a session.
[01:47.93]Can I... Did you get that?
[01:48.91]It still... It just doesn't say you're playing a game.
[01:51.09]I don't know why it's doing that.
[01:53.71]That doesn't make any sense.
[01:54.41]It's probably... It might be a privacy setting.
[01:57.28]But... How would it be a privacy setting if we just played together like four hours ago?
[02:01.58]You know what I mean?
[02:03.54]Because you joined off me.
[02:05.22]Yeah, but you can't... You can't... I can't join you.
[02:06.74]Well, I don't know what changed since then.
[02:08.77]No.
[02:12.44]And we played the other two games fine.
[02:13.96]Yeah, I can't join you from your profile either.
[02:20.65]No settings changed.
[02:22.25]I joined off you fine like four hours ago when we first started.
[02:25.13]That's annoying.
[02:32.48]Restart again?
[02:33.24]Hmm.
[02:41.89]Let's see.
[02:46.75]Restart Steam.
[02:47.53]I already tried that.
[02:52.41]I can't join him off games list either.
[02:54.95]Doesn't work.
[02:55.68]Hold on.
[02:56.28]Let me try something else.
[03:07.46]Chat tech support stream.
[03:09.39]yeah as always and what's funny is we absolutely obviously we play this on stream earlier but we do test this stuff out before the stream starts believe it or not well but we lit we literally played on str I joined you on the stream and then we're having weird internet problems like where like in in the game like I was rubber banding and now okay that worked what happened
[03:36.08]Steam Overlay is mandatory to have turned on.
[03:40.09]I had turned off Steam Overlay like before the stream.
[03:43.59]Really?
[03:43.95]And that's the only thing that I changed is turning on Steam Overlay.
[03:48.93]Huh.
[03:51.99]That's very strange.
[03:54.31]So just FYI in case anybody else is having the same problem.
[04:00.37]But it was off when we were playing before.
[04:03.61]I don't know.
[04:03.93]Who knows?
[04:04.51]Who has any idea at this point?
[04:05.71]I'm going to change this.
[04:07.77]I was just thinking of anything that I had done today.
[04:09.95]Let's change this back.
[04:18.64]Overcooked.
[04:22.60]Alright.
[04:25.58]Are you ready?
[04:27.02]Time to cook.
[04:31.36]Yep.
[04:34.44]One second.
[04:35.94]And let's go.
[04:39.68]I forget the whole game.
[04:40.58]Start at the beginning.
[04:42.83]Well, we're going straight to 3-4.
[04:44.67]Yeah, let's beat Chapter 3.
[04:47.69]And then we could probably call it there.
[04:49.43]It's probably just this mission.
[04:51.13]We gotta at least see what the next series of missions are.
[04:53.15]There's at least two or three missions after this.
[04:54.55]Alright, who am I?
[04:56.06]I'm the raccoon.
[04:56.90]I'm the raccoon.
[04:57.50]Alright, so we need... What are we doing?
[05:00.12]Hamburgers?
[05:00.52]Hamburgers.
[05:00.96]Back in the hamburgers.
[05:01.64]Alright, so I'm gonna throw you shit.
[05:04.14]So you need cheese, cheese.
[05:07.55]What am I doing?
[05:08.87]You need lettuce, lettuce.
[05:10.57]Who cuts?
[05:11.15]I cut?
[05:12.01]Uh, yeah.
[05:13.39]Wait, hold on, hold on.
[05:14.03]Start over, start over, start over.
[05:15.31]We need only burgers, because we still have to start cooking burgers first.
[05:19.71]Oh, wait, we have teleporters here.
[05:22.03]Yes, we do.
[05:22.63]Oh, Lord.
[05:23.17]Oh, they're very complicated.
[05:24.41]Alright, we need to cook the patties.
[05:31.61]So...
[05:34.07]440.
[05:34.09]I need meat, not tomatoes.
[05:41.19]Okay, I want just... Okay, you can actually throw them.
[05:43.33]Can I... Wait, wait, wait.
[05:45.61]Can I throw them from here, like, into there?
[05:48.65]Yeah, okay.
[05:49.81]Yeah, but I... That just gives me, like, an extra step.
[05:53.41]Okay, there you go.
[05:56.85]So you need... I need meat, man.
[05:59.59]Yeah, I do need hamburger meat.
[06:05.00]Lots of it.
[06:08.77]Just three, though.
[06:09.97]Okay, so then just three.
[06:11.85]Yeah, because I only have three burners.
[06:13.21]Okay, and then you need cheese, cheese.
[06:15.53]You need three cheeses.
[06:16.35]I mean, I guess I could come over there and, like, help, right?
[06:21.35]But that would take time.
[06:22.77]I mean, that's what the teleporters are there for.
[06:24.39]Yes.
[06:26.15]Lettuce.
[06:26.49]I wish I had a thing to chop over here.
[06:27.95]It takes me forever to get over here.
[06:33.97]Mouse pointer?
[06:35.21]Thank you, sorry about that.

[10:54.43]Put a meat on.
[10:55.15]Turn it.

[10:56.61]You're freaking me out.
[10:59.07]Here, take these plates.
[10:59.79]Because I only have 20 seconds.
[11:01.79]We already got three stars, by the way.
[11:02.97]We're good.
[11:06.13]We do?
[11:06.61]Yeah.
[11:06.87]Oh, we do.
[11:07.41]It was 400.
[11:07.71]Well, there you go.
[11:14.99]Just dance around for like 10 minutes.
[11:16.23]This one's really tough to do with two people.
[11:19.20]This is weird.
[11:20.94]There's four teleporters, for goodness sakes.
[11:22.70]Okay, we got it.
[11:29.36]We're good.
[11:29.82]We got it.
[11:41.54]Why doesn't Plankton show up to steal the secret recipe?
[11:43.66]Because...
[11:45.05]This is not the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants.
[11:48.89]Because all those voice actors are passed away.
[11:51.95]What?
[11:52.85]Is that true?
[11:53.25]No.
[11:53.57]Okay, for a second, I was like, are you kidding me?
[11:57.91]When did that happen?
[11:59.83]No, like Mr. Krabs was in Detroit Become Human.
[12:03.15]Oh, right, okay.
[12:06.07]Alright, we got one or two more levels here in level three.
[12:08.90]420 is the goal.
[12:15.23]Oh.
[12:15.67]This one is chicken and... Okay, I didn't... You gotta cut... Yeah, you gotta cut.
[12:21.38]We need chicken and potatoes.
[12:22.56]Okay, and you gotta cook.
[12:24.90]Ooh.
[12:25.30]You just threw it in there.
[12:26.10]Alright, go for it.
[12:27.46]Ooh.
[12:28.52]So we need chicken, and then we need potatoes again.
[12:30.27]So now we're on the move.
[12:35.09]We got people on the lazy river right now.
[12:39.02]Okay, what the fuck did you just throw at me?
[12:42.18]I just gave you the chicken.
[12:43.24]Okay, I need a plate.
[12:44.78]I need plates.
[12:51.12]Okay, and when they're dirty, you're gonna have to pass them back.
[12:53.44]That's all good.
[12:54.68]This is just French fries.
[12:56.88]Now, uh, here.
[12:58.52]Back in the basket.
[12:59.48]I could come over and help you, but I'm just gonna stay here and be useless.

[13:04.00]Right up.
[13:04.68]Here's a plate.
[13:05.12]Alright, we need, uh, one with both.

[13:21.21]In the fryer later, right?
[13:22.13]Like, in here.
[13:23.21]You can put it in the fryer whenever you want.
[13:24.64]No, it has to be cut.
[13:25.28]It has to be cut.

[14:54.54]Give it to me.
[14:54.98]It's just done.
[14:58.82]Take that.
[15:01.40]I put it back because I pressed the button again too quickly afterwards, apparently.
[15:05.31]Alright, I need, uh... One chicken.
[15:09.69]I'm gonna take two.
[15:10.59]You're gonna need it later.
[15:11.37]Gettin' plates.

[15:25.95]Is this one already done?
[15:27.09]It is done.
[15:27.43]And here's another plate.
[15:31.90]Is it safe to cross yet?
[15:38.02]Alright.
[15:38.30]Now we need... We got the chicken.
[15:39.74]We need a potato.
[15:40.26]We need separate chicken, separate potato.
[15:44.08]Toss it over here.
[15:50.27]Alright.
[15:50.99]Plates.
[15:51.85]You've got one.
[15:52.35]Alright.
[15:54.15]I don't know if we're going to get this one.
[15:56.25]I'm going to bring you the plate immediately.
[15:58.99]Give me, give me, give me, give me.
[16:02.83]Got 13 seconds.
[16:03.45]Looking good.
[16:03.95]That's probably about as far as we get.
[16:05.71]That's probably it.
[16:07.08]We didn't three-star.
[16:09.98]Last call.
[16:22.84]It's really the failed orders.
[16:24.66]Like, without the two failed orders, we... Yeah, that's true.
[16:27.66]Ooh.
[16:28.61]You really do have to... We've lost a lot of points just from missing one or two orders.
[16:36.27]That would mean it was the difference between two and three stars.
[16:39.95]Croc Chef looking... Looking pretty good.
[16:47.15]So we got one more of these.
[16:48.87]Three sixes.
[16:55.08]I thought I was just driving for a second.
[16:59.32]I just gave you the controller to make you feel better.
[17:01.65]Alright, this looks hard.
[17:05.09]Oh, boy.
[17:05.91]Is this the finale level?
[17:07.33]This is probably the finale.
[17:08.19]These are tacos or burritos or whatever.
[17:10.13]Okay, I'm gonna just grab a chicken.
[17:11.87]Oh, we have to cross in the middle?
[17:13.35]Yeah, okay, so you have to cut.
[17:14.36]Hold on, I'm trying to get my bearings.
[17:17.80]There's a lot going on here.
[17:19.20]You have to throw me the rice, because the cookies are over here.
[17:23.95]Okay.
[17:24.47]And then... Wait, what?
[17:26.71]Man, third person could just be the ingredient.
[17:28.93]Hold on, I gotta restart.
[17:31.36]I couldn't figure out what I was doing there.
[17:32.92]Yeah, this was... 560?
[17:35.64]Three or four people?
[17:37.88]This is so much easier.
[17:38.96]It raises your required star level, though.
[17:41.72]Okay, well, here is... So now I need rice.
[17:44.01]You're gonna throw me the rice and the tortilla.
[17:46.45]Okay.
[17:51.32]Sorry, that really threw me off there.
[17:53.46]Because I can't keep up!
[17:55.50]Oh my god.
[17:59.30]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[18:00.82]Listen, I'm going to start off in the middle.
[18:02.96]I pressed X because fucking brain juice.
[18:06.45]The juices are all gone.
[18:09.95]Look, I'm just going to get on the middle here so you can get the right.
[18:13.51]Oh my!
[18:14.75]Throw it, come play!
[18:16.35]Throw it on the plate!
[18:17.61]Hey!
[18:24.73]Start it again!
[18:26.31]Let's do it again!
[18:27.35]It hurts.
[18:31.52]It hurts because it's real.
[18:33.24]My folic acid must be low.
[18:36.58]Alright, so, I'm gonna get on there.
[18:38.67]What about you?
[18:39.77]You seem to be chopped up.
[18:41.11]You gotta get rice going.
[18:42.89]There.
[18:44.91]I almost got two.
[18:45.77]Just throw it into my hands.
[18:48.51]Look, I'm gonna put tacos on this side.
[18:50.21]Yeah, I need a rice there.
[18:52.24]Yo!
[18:54.02]Okay, that's good.
[18:55.34]I'm gonna throw the meat over to you.
[18:56.92]Okay.
[18:57.54]I gotta get back to the other side.
[18:59.22]Take a chicken with you.
[18:59.90]Here.
[19:00.06]We gotta take the plates over to this side.
[19:07.42]Okay.
[19:07.72]Well, I almost just had a meltdown.
[19:10.12]Okay.
[19:12.16]Plates.
[19:12.70]We got a plate here.
[19:14.92]I don't know what's going on.
[19:15.64]What happened?
[19:17.51]Which one is cooked?
[19:22.76]Okay, here's a plate in the middle.
[19:25.18]Chicken?
[19:26.77]I got rice here.
[19:30.71]Alright, well you gotta bring it over here, because that's where the turn-in is.
[19:33.35]Put it on that middle plate.
[19:43.53]We're doing this so wrong.
[19:45.92]There's got to be an easier way.
[19:48.10]Start over one more time.
[19:49.08]Hold on a second.
[19:50.30]There's got to be a way.
[19:51.34]We can't be crossing back and forth.
[19:54.32]Do we have to?
[19:54.88]Maybe you put the plates on the middle and then I'll get them off the middle.
[19:59.27]I think the plates have to go in the middle.
[20:02.45]It's the only way.
[20:03.15]I'm going to do the same thing.
[20:05.03]Get you like seven rice.
[20:07.17]Don't do it yet because we've got to get the ingredients out.
[20:12.82]He just killed.
[20:13.42]He just hit me in the fucking head.
[20:18.11]So by the actual mystery game today, it's not over good hard this is um What was it?
[20:26.63]What's the kill you die game platformer?
[20:29.59]Yeah, so you throw you have to throw those two to me.
[20:32.47]We have to like trade back and forth Yeah, so like I throw you those you throw me these and then we have we'll figure it out when we get there So I need to know that yeah, there you go Get to rice here
[20:47.49]What's the other game we play?
[20:48.43]The one that never got finished.
[20:52.27]Oh, Wolf Quest.
[20:54.11]I think that was the catalyst to the whole stream going down.
[20:57.25]You put a plate on top of my taco ingredient.
[21:00.31]What are you talking about?
[21:03.74]I'm putting the rice plates on here so you can get them.
[21:06.34]Okay, but... So throw me some more rice.
[21:08.16]But they're cut...
[21:12.49]It's all about you, isn't it?
[21:14.63]Here you go.
[21:15.73]Thank you.
[21:16.81]That enough?
[21:17.61]Well, I'm throwing you the ingredients.
[21:19.29]Go get it.
[21:20.11]Alright, now... Yeah.
[21:23.18]Look, you have to throw me those two, and I have to throw you these two.
[21:26.36]Alright, there's a cooked rice here.
[21:38.20]Here.
[21:38.38]The chicken was not raw, right?
[21:40.65]See, because otherwise there's nobody over here.
[21:42.61]Don't meme me.
[21:44.53]Uh-oh, you better get back over there.
[21:46.19]Fast.
[21:47.65]What do I need?
[21:51.07]I need... See, I have to stay over here.
[21:53.97]Alright, well I gotta get the stupid taco shells.
[21:56.02]And here, take the pot too, because I don't have any plates over here.
[21:58.34]I don't have any, uh... Alright, I need, um... Well, you're putting... They can't go on top of the ingredients.
[22:05.26]It's just making everything go wrong.
[22:06.78]It's alright, we just have to complete this goddamn level.
[22:09.52]We have 170 points.
[22:11.32]You get three, start with 500.
[22:12.28]Oh, God damn it.
[22:13.44]I'm like moving around.
[22:14.52]This thing's going to burn.
[22:18.51]Something is happening right now.
[22:21.27]What?
[22:21.77]Why in the name of God?
[22:22.99]I only know how to get rice now.
[22:33.22]Okay.
[22:33.76]So what did you do?
[22:36.10]What are you doing?
[22:37.36]We weren't even close to 320.
[22:40.82]That's a one star, by the way.
[22:42.24]So you throw me the things on the top, and I'm going to throw you these.
[22:45.40]Okay, but I got to get cooking too.
[22:47.50]See, but when you throw me something, I can't also grab something and then throw it to you because my hands have food in them.
[22:53.50]I can only do the rice and the tortillas down here.
[22:56.22]I can't do anything else.
[22:58.16]So I have to toss you the meat while you toss me the things on the top.
[23:02.07]Okay, but don't throw it at me.
[23:02.95]Throw it off to the side.
[23:03.95]I'm going to throw it to the right.
[23:15.60]There we go.
[23:17.18]Okay, perfect.
[23:19.26]What the fuck is that?
[23:20.22]Okay, no more plates on top of the ingredients.
[23:23.04]Okay, so I have two plates over here.
[23:24.88]I'm about to rice them both.
[23:25.52]And when you have downtime, go get the gyro tortillas and then put them on the plates.
[23:31.84]Yes.
[23:34.60]Okay.
[23:35.48]So, didn't want to make it on that turn, but I'll make it on this one.
[23:41.11]See if I can get both.
[23:46.74]Nope.
[23:47.22]Wrong thing.
[23:51.14]Okay.
[23:51.82]So, by the way, here.
[23:52.96]Throw them on this side because we're going to ultimately need them over here.
[23:55.36]Take those.
[23:57.60]Okay.
[23:57.98]There's one.
[23:58.49]There's two.
[24:00.75]I need cooked rice on this one.
[24:02.69]I got tortillas.
[24:03.49]Oh, I thought I was doing the tortillas.
[24:06.45]Wait.
[24:06.91]I thought I was the tortilla guy.

[30:49.79]We need a fishy.
[30:53.74]We need dishes.
[30:57.53]They're just in the sink.
[31:07.87]Okay.
[31:08.81]That was not an order?
[31:10.43]What?
[31:11.16]We just dinged two non-orders.
[31:14.26]We did two false orders.
[31:15.82]We just dinged two wrong orders.
[31:18.56]In a row.
[31:19.28]Both of us.
[31:19.90]One did one each.
[31:20.88]I don't know.
[31:23.09]But I'm too tilted to, like, do anything else in the remaining 11 seconds.
[31:26.03]No, come on, come on.
[31:26.80]We got two cooked rice here.
[31:28.74]Put it on this plate.
[31:30.34]Put it down.
[31:32.80]No, wait.
[31:33.30]I need to put the rice on it.
[31:34.68]We don't have any fish.
[31:40.37]How did we do?
[31:42.03]Two stars.
[31:42.81]Didn't even try.
[31:45.13]Barely even tried.
[31:45.95]Alrighty.
[31:52.04]Oh, my God.
[31:55.91]What?
[31:56.75]Somebody in my chat said, don't get hit by a car or you're gonna need a second wheelchair.
[32:20.43]That's all.
[32:20.77]I'm just going to leave it there.
[32:22.25]Alright, what the fuck are we doing?
[32:25.46]Oh my god.
[32:29.02]Okay, alright.
[32:30.00]We need a tomato.
[32:32.50]And you need this too.
[32:33.30]You need lettuce.
[32:35.08]Actually, no, no, no.
[32:35.62]What am I doing?
[32:36.22]I can chop these.
[32:41.55]So, hold on.
[32:42.01]Who has what duty here?
[32:44.45]We need a tuber.
[32:45.49]I need potatoes and I need chicken over here.
[32:50.78]I need one lettuce.
[32:51.56]I need a chicken.
[32:55.88]I need one lettuce, please.
[33:05.35]Where's the turn in?
[33:06.99]Just put on the thing.
[33:09.97]Okay, so I need a chicken.
[33:12.61]I need everything.
[33:13.21]I need chicken, all of it.
[33:15.67]I need more than one.
[33:16.61]I need chicken, chicken, chicken.
[33:21.11]How about you?
[33:21.59]You need lettuce.
[33:26.09]Oh, I need plates, too.
[33:27.89]The washing machine is over here.
[33:29.37]You're going to have to pick them up and put them in the sink.
[33:35.60]Okay.
[33:36.16]Just stick them on my conveyor.
[33:37.58]That one's ready.
[33:42.06]Wash, wash, wash, wash, wash.
[33:47.85]Nice throw.
[33:49.80]We do need that chicken to be... Get it cooking.
[33:52.36]I know, but I had the plates.
[33:54.68]We didn't have any plates.
[33:55.70]How about you?
[33:56.12]Are you good?
[33:57.00]I need plates.
[33:59.96]Thanks.
[34:00.60]So we need... That's one potato.
[34:02.88]Ah, I got it.
[34:03.88]Okay, that one's ready.
[34:06.98]Alright, we need both of the chicken tenders.
[34:09.30]So this is just chicken, huh?
[34:10.36]Okay, so this one... It'll go in the trash if I'm not careful.
[34:13.36]I'm all in here.
[34:16.78]Alright, come on.
[34:17.68]What the hell?
[34:19.44]Like... There's something else in the meantime.
[34:23.16]I can't do anything else.
[34:23.90]I don't have any ingredients.
[34:25.02]I need that plate.
[34:26.22]I need to see any clean plate.
[34:30.59]Thank you.
[34:33.19]Alright, I need chicken, chicken, chicken.
[34:35.53]Chicken, chicken, chicken.
[34:41.25]Okay, yeah, you could do that too.
[34:46.28]And then those plates need to be cleaned.
[34:49.60]Okay.
[34:50.04]I will bring it over as soon as I can.
[34:52.17]You also need another lettuce over there.
[34:58.33]Well, there's really nothing that could be done about that.
[35:00.79]Nope.
[35:01.93]And we need that.
[35:02.86]Chicken is about to be deleted.
[35:04.48]We're going to lose this one, maybe.
[35:09.44]Oh, no, no, no.
[35:09.92]Don't say so.
[35:11.00]Come on.
[35:11.38]Hold on.
[35:12.20]Take this and put it in right now.
[35:15.03]Okay.
[35:15.63]And any plate.
[35:16.25]Any plate.
[35:16.61]Any plate.
[35:16.99]Any plate.
[35:17.67]Clean.
[35:17.95]I'm going.
[35:19.56]I'm going.
[35:19.96]I'm going.
[35:20.48]I'm going.
[35:20.90]I'm going.
[35:21.28]I'll do the rest of the plates.
[35:26.66]Alright.
[35:26.86]We need chicken and potatoes.
[35:28.16]I have potatoes.
[35:28.92]Throw them over here.
[35:35.88]I got chicken right here already.
[35:39.74]Touch your own damn lettuce.
[35:42.86]Look, I cut up all your ingredients so it's easier to eat.
[35:47.66]Here are the dirty plates about to go in the trash.
[35:53.64]Okay, here's the next one.
[35:54.94]Uh, here.
[36:01.37]One plain chicken.
[36:02.89]I'm just cooking.
[36:05.33]Any plate.
[36:05.97]Clean plate.
[36:07.73]Any plate.
[36:08.09]Just go.
[36:10.83]And there's another one.
[36:11.73]What?
[36:12.05]Come on.
[36:12.69]It went in the fucking trash.
[36:15.71]And you dumped it in the garbage.
[36:25.10]It's alright.
[36:25.66]We're fine.
[36:26.64]We got three stars.
[36:27.34]Imagine a restaurant.
[36:30.72]Oh, my God.
[36:38.52]Ooh.
[36:40.07]Splatoon 2, Chef.
[36:42.29]Splatoon?
[36:45.98]We need a Jerma inhaler.
[36:47.86]Yeah, I need to just be like... Oh, goddammit!
[36:53.40]No!
[36:59.39]Did your normal inhaler run out already?
[37:04.99]Oh my god.
[37:06.58]These are really fast.
[37:08.68]Wow.
[37:08.90]Alright, thanks for coming to the stream, everybody.
[37:15.56]Let's look at this.
[37:18.02]Okay, so how do we get to the other side?
[37:21.13]You gotta ride this.
[37:22.77]Oh.
[37:23.03]And not fall off.
[37:24.01]I know the mouse.
[37:26.86]Alright, so over here is the only knife, right?
[37:30.63]Two sets of knives.
[37:31.93]Yeah, we have to come over for the knives.
[37:33.67]So one of us should just stay here.
[37:36.63]Oh, they've switched directions.
[37:38.01]Oh, my God.
[37:44.05]Okay, so it's just cheeseburgers.
[37:45.69]So we're going to start by... There's a middle section here.
[37:50.84]And to get over there... Yeah, this is going to be a hoot.
[37:55.56]Let's just start it.
[37:56.12]Okay, so here's how it has to go.
[37:57.36]There's the meats on the left.
[37:58.36]It needs to be cut on the far right and cooked in the middle.
[38:01.34]Yep.
[38:01.60]Okay, so we start by both grabbing a burger.
[38:05.03]I want to do a test here.
[38:06.63]We both grab a cheeseburger.
[38:08.67]Meat.
[38:09.17]Does this go around and not fall off?
[38:11.73]It does.
[38:12.79]Okay.
[38:13.33]So we can put ingredients down.
[38:14.97]So one of us stays over here, split it up, and just make sure you just put it on the conveyor.
[38:20.55]Right?
[38:20.75]That would make the most sense, I think.
[38:23.01]Well, we have two chopping boards, so if we both go for the first order, then it'll be faster.
[38:27.78]We both go, we both chop, we both put it on the grill, then we rotate around.
[38:31.56]But would it be safer?
[38:33.62]Well, then we get into the position you're talking about where somebody comes over here and then somebody dances between the cutting board and the... Yeah, that's true.
[38:41.20]And the cooking.
[38:41.70]Let's try it.
[38:42.10]Let's give it a go.
[38:51.47]And here we go.
[38:52.45]Alright, I'll take the meat.
[38:56.15]It's that one.
[38:58.96]Knew it was gonna start I knew it's gonna happen the first time we tried for real.
[39:02.44]I just knew it was gonna happen Like it just it was going to happen Here's cheese Okay, I had to cut it You should never leave is the problem like get a plate Oh God
[39:28.15]We need cheese?
[39:29.13]Plate these.
[39:29.67]Plate these.
[39:32.23]Bring it back.
[39:33.27]No, just bring the plate over.
[39:34.25]That one's already got meat on it.
[39:39.85]Is it done right?
[39:42.41]No?
[39:43.33]Yeah.
[39:43.61]No, it needs lettuce.
[39:48.08]Well... One plain with no cheese.
[39:50.46]And then this one can be turned in.
[39:54.57]We could throw this shit, too.
[39:57.05]That one needs lettuce here.
[39:58.01]That one's done.
[40:02.27]Okay, so now we need just meat and meat.
[40:05.26]That's it.
[40:05.76]Just meat, meat.
[40:12.30]Oh, you can just throw them over.
[40:13.42]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[40:14.80]You can just whip them over here.
[40:20.45]Alright, you gotta get those.
[40:22.69]Also, dirty plates are back there.
[40:24.73]Hold on.
[40:29.30]That one's playing.
[40:30.50]The next one's playing too.
[40:32.16]I'm going to do the mid dishes.
[40:33.36]I'm going for the dishes right now.
[40:42.15]Alright, we just need one burger.
[40:46.73]There's one right up there.
[40:47.79]I can't reach it though.
[40:49.77]No!
[40:50.13]Oh, really?
[40:53.14]Come on, don't do that to me.
[40:53.96]There we go.

[41:25.60]What do we need, lettuce and cheese?
[41:27.60]Coming your way.
[41:34.64]What am I doing?
[41:35.84]Middle burner.
[41:36.30]Oh my fucking god, I hate life.
[41:46.63]You can't throw it now.
[41:49.20]Lettuce.
[41:49.46]Lettuce.
[41:50.08]Lettuce.
[41:50.68]Lettuce.
[41:51.02]Lettuce.
[41:51.36]Lettuce.
[41:51.74]Lettuce.
[41:52.52]Lettuce.
[41:53.86]Put the lettuce on that one.
[41:54.84]There.
[41:57.56]Alright.
[41:58.62]We need one with cheese.
[42:00.00]I can't reach that one.
[42:02.19]I got to do the dishes.
[42:03.65]Three of them.
[42:04.21]Two of them.
[42:05.07]And dead.
[42:09.15]There we go.
[42:10.11]And the cheese.
[42:11.49]Just need the cheese on it.
[42:13.99]And that's it.
[42:15.31]Go cut that cheese.
[42:17.29]Ah.
[42:19.01]Forget about the cheese patties.
[42:21.57]Just throw it back over.
[42:22.51]Okay.
[42:27.79]Um... We need plates.
[42:29.43]I mean... We can do one more.
[42:32.21]We need burgers.
[42:32.81]We just need one burger.
[42:33.99]I think we just got the minimum, but that's alright.
[42:37.40]They're off the burner.
[42:39.06]Uh...
[42:41.02]Wait, what happened?
[42:43.98]I can't.
[42:46.78]Are you lagging again?
[42:47.76]No, I'm just kind of tired.
[42:50.04]Are you bouncing around again?
[42:52.20]Come on, one star.
[42:55.60]No, we get three.
[42:57.03]Wow.
[42:57.57]Somehow.
[42:58.93]Three starred?
[43:00.13]They don't expect people to do very well on that one, apparently.
[43:08.21]Gamers don't even have to try live on streams.
[43:11.01]Still better than the game.
[43:13.07]We tried.
[43:13.53]No, we did.
[43:15.09]I mean, yeah.
[43:16.75]We did try.
[43:17.85]But if you act nonchalant about it, then it's more impressive.
[43:25.91]actually um the more people you play in overcooked the harder the game gets because one weak link ruins the whole game and it like quadruples the amount of stars now so you uh I got potatoes over here so we just have to kind of deal with it right there are earthquakes potato again
[43:48.19]Uh, you need potato over there.
[43:50.40]Oh, that would make sense.
[43:51.46]Is there only one?
[43:52.22]No, there's two.
[43:53.10]Uh, don't... Okay, be careful.
[43:54.30]The wind does actually, uh... The wind... Is this cooked?
[43:57.86]Is it?
[43:58.52]No, it's not.
[43:58.92]That's a lie.
[44:00.70]Oh my god, am I scratching my eye?
[44:02.22]Alright, we need... Whoops.
[44:06.39]Oh well.
[44:09.63]So, let's do... I'm just gonna cook... Cut and cook potatoes and just let me know what you need.
[44:15.82]Okay, we need, uh, one cooked chicken and potato together.
[44:20.06]I've already got the potato.
[44:21.10]Okay, well, here's... And I'm dead.
[44:22.48]You have the chicken?
[44:27.18]It is not cooked yet.
[44:28.44]Oh.
[44:28.68]Well, here's cooked potato.
[44:31.18]We have to dump the thing.
[44:32.08]We have to put them on a plate.
[44:34.03]Because we don't have any other way to cook.
[44:36.41]Oh, fuck.
[44:36.89]Where are the fry-o-laters?
[44:38.93]Wait, where are the... Hey, I'm looking for a fry-o-later.
[44:43.59]Um, we only have two?
[44:46.72]Yeah, we only have two.
[44:47.20]Okay, there are only two Fryolators.
[44:50.32]And Dirty Dishes too.
[44:51.56]And Dirty Dishes.
[44:55.40]So that's plated.
[44:56.08]Okay.
[44:57.72]Get back in here.
[44:58.34]This one's ready to go.
[45:01.00]Is this one cooked?
[45:01.60]Okay, one plain chicken.
[45:04.30]One plain... We need plates.
[45:11.20]Where are the burners?
[45:12.16]Oh, they're over there.
[45:13.04]Okay, we need one plain chicken.
[45:19.41]Use the burner.
[45:20.85]It's got potatoes in it.
[45:22.77]I know.
[45:24.53]It's alright.
[45:24.85]I got the plain chicken over here.
[45:25.99]We need to wear the plates.
[45:27.77]There's dirty plates.
[45:29.41]I don't know.
[45:30.65]It's not even cooked.
[45:31.90]It's just out by itself.
[45:32.96]It's alright.
[45:39.96]Is that cooked chicken over there?
[45:40.92]It is.
[45:41.10]That is cooked chicken.
[45:43.50]What happened?
[45:45.18]Okay, chicken and potatoes.
[45:46.47]We need chicken and potato.
[45:47.63]Here's potato.
[45:49.26]You can turn that in.
[45:49.98]Okay.
[45:51.84]Now we need chicken and potato.
[45:54.04]I'll take the potato.
[45:55.42]You take the chicken.
[45:58.88]Over to the next.
[45:59.46]We need another potato.
[46:00.98]Yeah.
[46:01.18]You only cook potatoes.
[46:02.42]I only cook chicken.
[46:03.38]Yeah.
[46:03.58]Why did we make this so complicated for ourselves?
[46:05.27]Alright.
[46:10.59]We're going to do dishes.
[46:13.63]Okay.
[46:13.93]One plain chicken coming up.
[46:19.75]Dishes are ready.
[46:21.41]So this is potato cooking.
[46:25.11]Got plates, clean plates.
[46:26.29]I'm going to do the rest of those dishes.
[46:28.73]Now, combo.
[46:33.28]We need a combo here.
[46:33.94]I got cooked potatoes right here.
[46:38.00]We don't have enough time, or should I just get the fold for this one?
[46:40.56]Come over here and just get this one.
[46:48.68]And there actually may be time for a plain chicken.
[46:51.58]Is there?
[46:52.00]No place.
[46:53.66]I'm holding one.
[46:54.26]Oh, you are?
[46:54.68]Okay.
[46:55.84]Just make the run for it.
[46:56.64]You got it.
[46:57.64]Alright.
[46:57.86]That's good.
[46:59.42]527.
[46:59.44]Not bad.
[47:02.08]Eat raw chicken on stream or pre-recorded.
[47:05.28]Wow.
[47:05.68]That last chicken, man.
[47:08.86]Seven bucks over the budget for three stars.
[47:13.46]Seems pretty good, man.
[47:17.70]cheese grater on feet but pre-recorded I could never get over that so it looks like we got one or two more how much how much juice do you have left in the tank I have enough juice um I got enough juice to finish chapter four uh so funny story before the stream you told me
[47:43.93]that you just wanted to play a game and relax today.
[47:47.35]How's that gone for you so far?
[47:51.05]I'm alright.
[47:51.59]This is fine.
[47:53.67]You sure you're not... No, I mean, it's just the game's hard.
[47:58.66]Feeling the burn?
[47:59.66]No.
[47:59.90]I'm feeling a little burn.
[48:00.92]I mean, I'm feeling the burn, but it's still fun.
[48:04.62]Well, yeah, I'm not saying it's not fun.
[48:05.90]I mean, the only thing that was stupid was WolfQuest.
[48:07.44]These are all, except for WolfQuest, these have both been very difficult games.
[48:11.32]But I feel like if we didn't play WolfQuest, we would have the brain power to be able to do the other two games fine.
[48:18.51]WolfQuest was like throwing a cog into the wheel, and the bike flipped over.
[48:26.31]It has so much potential.
[48:27.71]WolfQuest was dope.
[48:31.29]Alright.
[48:31.51]So here we go.
[48:33.09]Conveyor belt goes all the way around.
[48:35.03]Alright.
[48:35.93]So that means we need two plates both with the... We need fish.
[48:43.33]I'll cut the fish up here and put it on.
[48:45.05]Okay.
[48:45.33]So your button, you have to hit when you want it to go to your side.
[48:48.74]So like if you hit it, it flips the middle one.
[48:50.44]Okay.
[48:52.22]Well, get to work.
[48:53.16]So like... Okay.
[48:54.60]What you waiting for?
[48:56.14]I'm sorry.
[48:56.74]I'm just making sure we understand... I need rice over here, man.
[48:58.52]I need rice.
[48:59.76]It's cooking.
[49:02.18]Yeah, I got a plate with a fish and a wrap on it right here.
[49:08.46]Well, then send it to me.
[49:14.30]Can you get that?
[49:14.83]Yeah, that's why I was trying to explain the instructions.
[49:16.69]You put it on the middle one.
[49:17.59]And then you press the button.
[49:18.27]There it is.
[49:19.47]I already did.
[49:21.31]Oh, my God.
[49:26.33]Stop!
[49:28.19]Don't push the button.
[49:29.34]You're just looping it over and over again.
[49:32.44]Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
[49:33.86]I'm feeling good.
[49:34.86]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[49:36.54]I'm at full mental capacity right now.
[49:38.78]I can't mess with your mental capacity by switching you around.
[49:41.64]Come on, man.
[49:43.49]Uh-huh.
[49:44.01]Yeah, it's all a prank.
[49:45.49]It's all just a prank.
[49:46.41]It very clearly was.
[49:47.79]Alright, we have the fish that we need.
[49:52.95]Throw this in the fire.
[49:56.98]Alright, what are we doing?
[49:57.60]We're doing cucumbers.
[49:59.24]Oh, you need cucumbers.
[50:00.06]Sure thing.

[50:13.13]Wait, that wasn't an order?
[50:14.33]Apparently that was wrong.
[50:15.17]You didn't need cucumbers in that one, apparently.
[50:17.37]There's one with fish and... There was no rice.
[50:19.87]Oh, well, apparently.
[50:23.97]Redo!
[50:26.92]480.
[50:28.40]480.
[50:29.08]Very doable.
[50:32.20]First one.

[50:55.02]We need chopped fish.
[50:57.29]Yes, you do.
[50:59.45]And you need another cucumber.
[51:00.95]Yeah, I did the wrong order.
[51:04.69]What?
[51:05.83]Well, I mean, I did a future order.
[51:07.05]Get that fish!
[51:07.65]Get that fish!
[51:08.06]Get that fish!
[51:14.12]Okay, calm down, alright?
[51:18.44]Look, I'm about to send you some dishes and I gotta put more rice.
[51:23.11]I'll press the button.

[51:30.20]Thank you.
[51:34.48]Okay, so I need, I got the cucumber.

[51:43.73]You need fish?
[51:50.64]Oh, you get it.
[51:52.84]I'm getting other orders ready.
[51:54.92]You need cucumbers, man.
[52:01.31]Okay.
[52:02.81]Order up.
[52:03.57]And I got the cucumber.
[52:04.83]Check.
[52:05.73]We need one fish.
[52:07.11]Mm-hmm.
[52:08.32]I'm going to put some more rice on.
[52:09.46]Are you prepared to take all this?
[52:12.62]I need plates.
[52:15.14]I have to give them to you.
[52:17.00]Alright.
[52:17.38]Toss me those plates.
[52:22.58]Yum, yum.
[52:23.30]They won't mind if I scrape the sushi up off the floor, will they?
[52:26.11]No.
[52:26.49]I hope not.
[52:27.63]Why would they?
[52:28.07]They know what they're getting here.
[52:34.38]Press that button.

[67:38.24]Tortilla, out here.
[67:38.98]I'm going to do dishes.
[67:44.10]Alright, let me see.
[67:44.66]We need a mushroom.
[67:46.34]Cooked mushrooms are down there.
[67:47.46]We need rice.
[67:49.10]Rice is currently done right there.
[67:50.20]I'm going to plate this one.
[67:53.94]What's going on?
[67:56.04]Oh no, he crashed.
[68:19.27]Well... I got Comcasted.
[68:24.23]Well... At least we tried.
[68:30.86]Both of their streams died?
[68:32.04]No, mine's up.
[68:34.54]Oh.
[68:34.82]Yeah, mine's up.
[68:36.34]Oh, I died.
[68:39.36]Well... I got Comcasted.
[68:41.38]Well... Well, that's a good way to call it.
[68:48.79]It got away.
[68:49.37]I feel like we were doing pretty good there.
[68:53.73]We were doing alright.
[68:54.41]It's okay.
[69:01.46]At least we had fun.
[69:07.40]I got infected by the bug.
[69:11.48]Yeah.
[69:12.78]It sucks.
[69:15.92]And there's nothing I could do.
[69:18.44]No.
[69:20.88]But... Thanks for playing, Etalyx.
[69:26.00]Thanks for hanging out.
[69:26.72]Yep.
[69:27.50]Always a fun time.
[69:30.16]It was fun.
[69:31.02]I especially enjoyed the one in the middle.
[69:33.40]Overcooked 2 is fun.
[69:35.23]Yeah.
[69:35.67]No, the other one.
[69:36.97]Which one?
[69:37.77]Wolf Quest?
[69:38.93]Yeah.
[69:40.11]You didn't like that game.
[69:41.77]Oh, I loved it.
[69:43.03]I loved getting to piss all over everything.
[69:45.97]Well, you can pee in people in a lot of other games, too.
[69:50.95]But that is going to wrap up tonight's stream.
[69:55.06]And those of you that you might have sprinted over here from Metallix's stream that died, yes, his stream died.
[70:00.80]He is currently here.
[70:03.08]I think it reconnected.
[70:04.18]Oh.
[70:05.44]Okay.
[70:07.32]But, regardless, thanks for coming out.
[70:12.44]Yep.
[70:13.74]That was, what, five hours?
[70:15.92]A little more, maybe.
[70:17.36]Five, five and some change.
[70:19.90]Yeah, it's a pretty good stream.
[70:21.50]No, it was good.
[70:22.54]I wish we could play Jackbox, but it just doesn't work.
[70:25.46]No, you really kind of have to be in the same room.
[70:27.93]But hey, that will happen shortly.
[70:30.83]Now, won't it?
[70:32.83]Oh, yeah.
[70:34.69]Oh, yeah.
[70:35.73]Plans are being made.
[70:36.87]That's right.
[70:41.22]But, yeah.
[70:43.06]Tomorrow.
[70:45.54]The move is tomorrow.
[70:47.74]I wish.
[70:50.13]But I'm going to do the credits.
[70:51.65]Someone turns out really, really likes Hornets and bought it on the spot.
[70:57.45]That'd be great, actually.
[70:58.57]Somebody was like a Hornet enthusiast.
[71:04.37]But time to do the credits.
[71:05.91]Etalyx, thanks for hanging out.
[71:07.41]As always, buddy.
[71:11.34]It was a good time getting, uh... Stop giving me all of your... Well, you know what?
[71:18.61]Like, I mean, we had... It was going real well.
[71:23.41]And then we got, like, that weird disconnect problem.
[71:27.23]And then... We couldn't join each other again.
[71:30.15]We had to go to the mystery game Wolf Quest.
[71:32.21]And then I just had to win in regular human basketball twice out of three times.
[71:36.66]You drained all my goddamn brain energy.
[71:40.40]So that was, you know, very regrettable that that had to happen in front of everybody.
[71:45.82]Luckily, the stream didn't disconnect then.
[71:47.34]Yeah, too bad the stream didn't disconnect as you, like, stuck a syringe in the back of my head and pulled back.
[71:58.62]Alright, guys.
[71:59.26]No, but all of the shit-talking and jokes aside, that game was very interesting and fun.
[72:04.90]Yeah, I mean, it's as cheap as you could get without being free, too.
[72:08.46]Yeah.
[72:10.13]It's $5.
[72:12.69]But I'm going to leave the call.
[72:16.19]Ta-ta for now, Talos.
[72:18.75]Alright.
[72:19.29]Talk to you later, guys.
[72:22.22]Goodbye.
[72:22.58]Good night.
[72:24.86]Oh, he just gnomed me.
[72:25.56]Did you hear that?
[72:27.10]Gnome?
[72:27.74]Gnome, huh?
[72:28.90]He's in on that too?
[72:33.38]But let's close this.
[72:36.63]Let's do the credits.
[72:39.42]unfortunately because the stream crashed a lot of the subs and resubs might have been taken down because I let's see yep so these credits will probably be a little thin so sorry about that everybody thank you so much for subscribing though
[73:07.19]There's a lot of people subbed to this channel now.
[73:10.88]And... Seriously, it's mind-blowing.
[73:15.08]So, thank you guys.
[73:19.18]Let's do the credits.
[73:27.53]They're over here.
[73:29.95]Oh, stream not starting.
[73:30.85]Stream is ending.
[73:34.96]so of course a very special thank you to these people where are they uh
[73:53.39]I think... I think this might be broken.
[73:58.93]Maybe nobody's subscribed.
[74:02.39]Zero subs.
[74:04.84]Yeah, I don't think there's any subs... No, that... Was there?
[74:10.60]Yeah, there was.
[74:16.43]Barty, you buy?
[74:17.89]Nobody.
[74:25.13]Well, that's not true because I can see that somebody subscribed here like an hour ago while the stream was on.
[74:30.75]Unless... What if the credits are moving that slowly?
[74:35.81]Right?
[74:36.34]It's possible.
[74:41.10]How many people subscribed here in the last hour?
[74:48.02]I think one person did.
[74:52.56]This might just be that slow.
[74:59.79]It might be that slow because of that.
[75:01.48]That's so funny.
[75:03.38]I need to sit here and see.
[75:11.20]Somebody just subscribed.
[75:12.98]So where are they?
[75:14.18]Roll the credits, man!
[75:18.59]I don't know.
[75:18.91]This is fucked up.
[75:19.59]It must have been from the OBS crashing.
[75:21.71]I don't know if they reconfigured this shit.
[75:26.29]Well...
[75:32.30]Uh, it's actually I got it here It's moving so slowly, but I got the credits here from this stream being turned on It's crawling at such a tiny speed I can't even like link this over here
[76:00.07]Yeah, I can't even roll them.
[76:02.67]That's annoying, I guess.
[76:03.85]It should be for the day, not for the broadcast length.
[76:08.95]Unfortunately.
[76:12.74]No, that doesn't make any sense.
[76:19.06]Alright, here we go.
[76:20.28]Thank you to... Subscriber1.
[76:24.86]That's not real.
[76:25.92]That's a fake one.
[76:28.16]Um...
[76:30.23]Well, I can just read them from here.
[76:32.96]The ones that were from this stream.
[76:34.92]So, hey!
[76:37.02]So, for the last little bit of time here, thank you to Ghosty McToasty, Freemanator, Yurteb, that's annoying, Yurteb for the win, BadVinsky, StarWolfKen, TTOK, TTOK,
[76:59.34]Enigmatic Paradox, Spektag, Mixi Mixi, Gentle Ghosts, and Supreme TDM.
[77:09.95]And then Razzle2 and Leosav.
[77:13.67]Why are they not showing up?
[77:16.91]Why is... The two people that just subscribed, they're not on my streamlabs.
[77:23.81]What?
[77:26.28]What?
[77:34.22]stream like up man it has to be something to do with the ups but regardless sorry that I cannot read these subs thank you so much everybody you guys are amazing and with that I got the bits are here though I still do have the bits so we can do the bits they are all here so why don't we start
[78:02.79]Again, if you're leaving, just to let you know, next stream is going to be Sunday.
[78:07.69]And that will have the emotes, and we're going to play a blind legend.
[78:14.71]So that's the Sunday stream.
[78:16.39]Sunday afternoon, probably.
[78:18.99]So that is set in stone.
[78:20.57]It's happening.
[78:21.01]I've given myself a day here.
[78:28.40]Get everything situated.
[78:30.87]What time?
[78:31.51]Probably around... I would just leave it at 7.
[78:35.45]Because for some reason, you know me.
[78:37.55]Whoops!
[78:38.69]But the plan is to do it somewhere around like 4 or 5.
[78:41.15]But just leave the... Leave it to 7, just in case.
[78:47.49]But, let's start with the bits.

[80:08.24]Okay.
[80:10.48]So this one is titled Jerma fucking dies.
[80:12.62]Let's get it on there.
[80:18.25]Add.
[80:18.45]Let's get the browser on there.
[80:21.49]Hey, there it is.

[80:43.37]Okay, he landed.

[81:15.81]Thank you, Grizzly1620.
[81:18.30]WetBite, thanks for the $5.
[81:19.80]Just says FrankerZ.
[81:20.70]Thank you.
[81:22.14]MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[81:23.58]My favorite dog names are the ones that are just normal human names, like Dave or Susan.
[81:30.68]That's what we were talking about.
[81:34.09]Thank you mostly loss again for the $1 I've actually been trying to come up with a name for the cat I'm getting in a few months and I guess that settles it say hi to Jeremy the cat Jeremy the cat Not a bad name for a cat Is it a kitten I hope it's a kitten Sly 161 thanks for the $1 remember the meme ban.
[82:00.57]Can we do that again?
[82:01.41]But like only for the counting meme
[82:05.23]You saw what happened when I did that.
[82:06.83]I banned all the memes.
[82:09.43]And then it was just a riot for a month straight.
[82:14.77]I had to let him out.
[82:20.47]I couldn't even stream.
[82:23.00]It was just total chaos.
[82:27.26]Counting sucks.
[82:34.92]It only took you a month to ban the memes too.
[82:38.52]So I banned them for a month, brought them back for a month.
[82:40.90]Did a whole stream.
[82:41.88]I spent like hours and hours and hours making characters to do that.
[82:47.59]Just to go back on it because my stream got taken over.
[82:51.21]Everybody was getting like banned and timed out and it was a fucking disaster.
[83:00.98]Just banned characters.
[83:01.60]You know what?
[83:03.26]Why don't we just ban counting?
[83:05.86]Because it doesn't contribute anything.
[83:07.96]It just puts people just writing numbers in the chat room.
[83:11.51]You know what I'm saying?
[83:12.85]It's just counting numbers.
[83:14.45]There's nothing there.
[83:21.29]That's it.
[83:23.27]That doesn't even need to be a joke on the screen.
[83:26.81]Sometimes I look over and it's just happening.
[83:33.73]Alright, burn it.
[83:36.05]Burn it, ban it.
[83:42.75]That's the one.
[83:43.95]That's the one that goes... Burn it.
[83:54.92]Now, you can use numbers.
[83:56.68]You can use numbers.
[83:58.02]But... But...
[84:01.57]If there are numbers in succession, that's when you, sayonara, you know what I mean?
[84:08.94]Like you could write the number seven, but don't, if somebody after you writes the number eight, they're gone.
[84:24.57]You understand?
[84:25.71]What am I supposed to do about this?
[84:31.43]Oh, you fucked up now.
[84:32.69]Whatever, whatever.
[84:34.37]It's alright.
[84:38.77]Thank you.
[84:41.67]Sly.
[84:42.28]Thank you, Darkstar, for the one dollar.
[84:43.72]Did you reclaim your house from the invasion of the bees?
[84:47.40]No, the hornets are all still here.
[84:49.60]Just, they haven't come into the house since last night.
[84:55.27]So I'm hoping that it's over.
[85:02.18]At least I hope.
[85:02.80]I say that now.
[85:04.98]But who knows what's going to happen in the next few hours or 12 hours or whatever.
[85:09.68]But here's hoping to yes.
[85:11.36]Prog.
[85:12.60]Maraster.
[85:13.32]Thanks for the $1.
[85:14.08]Jeremy, can you give me a good name for my bird if you know all the best pet names?
[85:20.56]Groucho.
[85:20.86]Are you serious?
[85:22.06]Groucho.
[85:26.83]That's perfect.
[85:30.63]Hey, thank you, Mostly Lost, for the $1.
[85:34.07]Local streamer doesn't understand economics, thinks putting a second steering wheel in a car costs nothing.
[85:39.77]Maybe like a premium, they'll get extra $400, whatever.
[85:44.64]Mostly Lost, thank you again for the $2 here.
[85:48.60]Local streamer doesn't understand basic chemistry, thinks rice can't catch fire.
[85:55.60]I understand chemistry, I just don't understand video game chemistry.
[86:00.44]And Etalyx has been the one doing dishes every single time.
[86:02.80]I'm sure you two will have no problems living together whatsoever.
[86:06.06]I don't do dishes.
[86:07.84]That's very clear.
[86:10.58]Nope.
[86:11.88]I will sweep.
[86:13.32]I will vacuum.
[86:14.62]I will clean the toilets.
[86:17.70]I will do laundry.
[86:21.35]I don't do dishes.
[86:28.48]What's wrong with dishes?
[86:30.32]I don't do them.
[86:36.02]He's a diva.
[86:40.02]Why?
[86:40.28]Because I don't do them.
[86:50.66]Why not?
[86:51.12]Because I just don't do them.
[86:56.10]Why?
[86:57.93]Don't feel like it.
[87:01.93]Why not?
[87:03.19]Why?
[87:03.43]It's not something I do.
[87:11.64]But why, though?
[87:14.02]I don't do it.
[87:14.46]Okay, this has to stop.
[87:18.46]I'm done.
[87:19.30]Of course I'll do the dishes.
[87:20.44]Maybe like once a year.
[87:23.28]But thank you, Brandon201Bakugan.
[87:26.74]For the $1.
[87:27.34]Hey, Jerma, what do you think of Binding of Isaac card game?
[87:29.80]8 out of 5,000.
[87:31.62]It looks interesting.
[87:34.80]I don't know how that's going to play, though.
[87:37.76]I'll probably give it a try.
[87:41.87]Thank you, Bake Me Home for the $5.
[87:44.19]Thanks a lot, man.
[87:46.03]Jerma, I had a terrible day to the point where my appetite was gone.
[87:49.15]Your stream has helped bring it back.
[87:51.27]And not just because it's food themed.
[87:52.79]Thanks for lifting our spirits so often.
[87:55.49]I get like that, too.
[87:58.84]Sorry you're feeling like that, but anytime I'm really pissed off or upset, here's the worst part about it.
[88:05.96]Sometimes I will go get food and I'll be hungry and then something will happen.
[88:12.05]Something will be really, really stressful or really irritating.
[88:14.19]By the time that I get the food either done cooking or back to the house, I don't want to eat it.
[88:22.63]And it's just so infuriating.
[88:25.71]And then you get to the point where sometimes you're like upset for more than like 12, 15 hours in a row.
[88:29.74]And like shit's just something's going on, right?
[88:32.68]And you know, in your brain, I have to eat something.
[88:36.86]I haven't eaten in like 12 to 16 hours.
[88:40.08]I have to eat.
[88:42.02]And you make yourself some food and you get it all on the plate.
[88:45.80]And then you just like painfully putting it into your mouth and chewing it.
[88:49.30]And it's just, I hate that.
[88:51.28]I'm really sorry you're feeling like that right now.
[88:55.12]Hopefully you can get over that quickly because it sucks.
[89:00.72]What am I talking about?
[89:01.34]I'm talking about when you get really pissed, depressed, or irritated and you lose your appetite completely.
[89:10.13]It's not fun.
[89:13.51]But hope you feel better, man.
[89:17.87]Thank you, Bake Me Home for the $5.
[89:21.35]Super seal.
[89:22.01]Thanks for the $1.
[89:22.85]Hello, Jerma.
[89:23.37]As a fellow scientist, what are your thoughts on patacyrin, the first gene silencing drug to win FDA approval?
[89:36.59]I don't know what that is.
[89:42.56]Is this like the geometric thing again?
[89:45.88]How do I feel about the eight-sided dice, whatever it was?
[89:52.81]I guess that's kind of cool.
[89:54.23]Whatever.
[89:54.51]I don't know what the fuck that is.
[89:59.00]So what, you can like... Pick how tall your kid's gonna be?
[90:04.26]You can take balding out of the equation?
[90:06.12]Hopefully that's for the... What, what, what?
[90:11.86]Isn't that one of those jokes?
[90:18.56]One of those... It's one of those jokes where you say something and it says something else?
[90:24.13]Ow.
[90:25.51]Thank you, SuperSeal.
[90:26.83]Thank you to Noki for the $1.
[90:28.93]Lettuce is the reason you survived.
[90:30.35]Also, hello, Boss Crappa.
[90:33.80]Thank you.
[90:34.74]Thank you, T-O-K, T-O-K, for the $1.
[90:36.94]Seaweed is called Kim in Korean.
[90:41.14]Fun fact.
[90:42.68]Fun fact.
[90:45.04]Hey, Atrolux, H-Rox, thanks for the $1.50.
[90:48.14]I drew this for you.
[90:50.40]Best Wasp Hunter.
[90:57.82]honestly the the best part about that stream last night was all the shit we were doing about the wasps we were making all the wasp references look at me kill this wasp and how strong I am and how cool I am and then a few get in the room and I I melted I turned into a two-year-old that's what you get for talking shit
[91:26.29]But thank you, Atrolux, for that drawing.
[91:28.59]Appreciate it, man.
[91:30.63]The Reaper of Memes, thanks for the $1 sauteed macaroni and wasps.
[91:35.12]Thank you, Peter, for the $2.
[91:36.46]Cool guy.
[91:37.20]Hey, thanks, dude.
[91:39.96]The Orange Pyro Ranger, thanks for the $5.15.
[91:41.96]Sorry this is a day late.
[91:45.48]As soon as I saw the bee explosion joke, I knew I had to make this.
[91:49.32]Sadly, I was busy.
[91:50.36]Alright.
[91:53.75]Let's take a look.
[91:58.76]Let's get it on the screen here.
[91:59.94]Okay, here it is.
[92:08.67]Yoink, yoink, yoink.
[92:11.66]Hey, take a look at the yoink, yoink right there.
[92:14.56]Okay.
[92:15.24]Alright.
[92:19.48]So I think the thing about...
[92:21.84]I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[92:25.87]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[92:27.15]You know, everything, we'll talk about this in a second.
[92:29.59]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[92:59.70]Ooh, up in smoke.
[93:05.56]Alright, so... My favorite part about all these are... The shittiest part of every single one of these has been the hornet flying around in the beginning.
[93:18.16]Everyone's done such a simple motion keyframe thing.
[93:22.32]That's the worst part of all of them.
[93:27.46]Everybody has that one like motion tween cut out And then it's the worst best part about all of it.
[93:36.06]It's a feature No, I'm not being critical I'm saying that's what I love that I
[93:47.74]That's the meme.
[93:48.40]I know, I know.
[93:48.96]I'm just saying that that's my favorite part is that is what turned into the meme there.
[93:54.67]Is the cutout from Google Images.
[94:00.23]And then everybody puts these like elaborate fireballs and elaborate fucking edits.
[94:09.16]I love it.
[94:09.74]It's fantastic.
[94:14.58]Floating bee from Google Images.
[94:22.07]It's a feature and a bug.
[94:23.93]And that's a literal.
[94:27.37]But thank you for that.
[94:29.05]Stellar job, dude.
[94:31.33]I don't know what animated sitcom that was from, but I'll have to watch it someday.
[94:39.25]Hey, thank you.
[94:39.79]Mostly lost for the $1.
[94:41.11]Trust me, Jerma, they do care.
[94:42.25]I had sub-3 GPA in college and couldn't get shit for internships.
[94:49.33]Well, if you're doing an internship, but after college, if you're trying to get an internship is college, that is part of college.
[95:04.74]Usually you get an internship through school.
[95:10.84]We're talking post, out of complete graduate.
[95:18.34]But I'm sorry to hear that, dude.
[95:19.42]For real.
[95:25.35]College is like fucked nowadays.
[95:26.95]It really is.
[95:31.21]It's so expensive to go to college.
[95:36.14]And getting hired out of college is so hard.
[95:48.83]It's kind of insane, actually.
[96:00.61]But... Don't need to get into the weeds on that one.
[96:04.91]But it's... I think... Let's go out on a limb here.
[96:13.66]Did you guys know?
[96:15.06]Did you guys know?
[96:17.23]that we only spend in this country, the United States of America, on our federal budget, less than 5% goes to education.
[96:25.60]Did you know that?
[96:27.26]Interesting stuff.
[96:31.87]Interesting stuff.
[96:37.99]Less than 5% goes to science and technology.
[96:40.67]Interesting stuff.
[96:43.47]Interesting stuff.
[96:54.96]More than, I think it's more than half the budget of the entire federal budget.
[97:00.22]We're talking the whole thing goes to the military and Social Security.
[97:08.05]I think Social Security, I think, is 26% of our entire budget.
[97:13.92]Huh.
[97:15.86]Interesting.
[97:23.35]And our military is, like, what, 20%?
[97:25.99]Something like that?
[97:29.65]Oh, interesting.
[97:36.22]We need to spend more goddamn money on our technology and our science programs, our education programs.
[97:48.05]Huh.
[97:49.75]Interesting.
[97:56.09]And now that don't mean it's got to be free, right?
[98:01.21]There's a lot of stuff that people will tell you on both sides.
[98:06.38]Some sound reasoning.
[98:10.10]Some compromise.
[98:15.93]I mean, if you count the Space Force as science and technology.
[98:21.14]Well, yeah, but I mean, just making a Space Force is making a Space Force.
[98:23.82]I'm talking about, like, where our money goes.
[98:26.66]Right?
[98:27.84]Just collectively.
[98:35.26]Compromise in 2K18.
[98:35.96]Well, that's it.
[98:49.71]You know, it's not about left or right.
[98:52.51]It's about how do we fix the problems.
[98:57.78]Both sides will tell you certain ways.
[98:59.62]And that's the only way.
[99:00.76]Apparently the only way.
[99:05.63]Is it true, though?
[99:07.31]I don't know.
[99:15.55]I'm trying to rustle some people.
[99:18.35]No, I'm just obviously pulling hairs out, but... Get back to bits.
[99:40.94]This man beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[99:42.82]He knows how to fix the budget.
[99:47.48]no I'm obviously just pushing buttons I think we should just drop all government and go back to just like eating rocks don't you think solve all these problems
[100:19.69]No, you use the rocks as money.
[100:21.41]You can eat them, too.
[100:22.11]You can eat and spend your money.
[100:24.33]How fucking amazing would that be?
[100:28.24]But anyways, thank you to Captain Crunch.
[100:30.64]Thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller, for the $1.
[100:34.38]Garfield proves that he's a real cat.
[100:38.48]It's less than a minute, but it took over a month to set up.
[100:42.00]Hope you enjoyed the lasagnas of my labor.
[100:44.06]Can you spot everyone?
[100:45.10]It's like an audio version of Where's Waldo.
[100:50.13]Alright, let's see.
[100:57.83]Wait.
[100:58.05]Hold on.
[100:58.37]What is this?
[101:01.95]Wait, audio?
[101:02.67]Where's Waldo?
[101:03.75]I just heard, like, Rick and Morty.
[101:05.21]Alright, let's put it on.
[101:22.33]There's Garfield.
[101:23.29]I can see Garfield.
[101:33.65]What?
[101:33.85]This is real.
[101:36.43]Hold on, what the fuck is going on?
[101:37.73]Alright, Morty, check it out.
[101:40.67]It's the home of the real Garfield.
[101:42.53]You know, the one who hates Mondays?
[101:44.57]Not the rip-off guy we had on our own show.
[101:47.17]Oh, no, it's Rick and Morty.
[101:49.11]Look, Rick, it's Garfield.
[101:51.48]He's right there watching a streamer.
[101:54.66]Hey, Garfield, I hope you don't mind, but I invited a few friends over.
[101:58.44]Blah, blah, blah.
[101:59.26]You get off the air.
[102:02.19]Where's Waldo?
[102:03.97]That's it.
[102:04.49]I mean, was that a where's Waldo?
[102:05.91]Or was that just Rick and Morty impressions and then an explosion?
[102:31.95]I did watch it.
[102:32.83]It's a black screen.
[102:37.71]Yeah, it was just a black screen.
[102:39.65]I had it on the screen.
[102:40.51]It really makes you think.
[102:49.59]That was supposed to be 3D audio.
[102:59.88]Alright, somebody has to figure out what was in all those.
[103:02.46]Somebody has to slow that down to 5%.
[103:04.72]Hey, it took Garfield a month to make that shit.
[103:12.38]Come on.
[103:14.69]There's probably 200 voice files in there.
[103:21.95]Thank you, Garfield.
[103:24.59]Thank you very much, Garfield.
[103:25.83]And thank you to Rick and Morty.

[112:15.61]I want you guys to spam, fuck you, no emotes.
[112:22.93]Don't do anything else for the entire stream if they're not there.
[112:29.67]So, if they're not there, that's what you can do the whole stream.
[112:37.36]It's not Sunday yet, so I don't know why you're doing it now.
[112:47.00]You're the boss.
[112:50.87]It's not Sunday yet.
[112:52.33]It's not Sunday.
[112:53.29]By the way, Sunday before the stream goes live.

[113:01.73]Sunday before the stream is live.

[118:15.92]Thank you, Stix.
[118:16.62]Renegade for the dollar, 76.
[118:20.24]But it's cute.
[118:20.98]Come on.
[118:21.34]Give me a break, guys.
[118:24.66]Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $1.76.
[118:25.94]Here I found a Canadian dollar at work, but since their dollar is worse than Apple's Twitch bits price, I have to add a US dollar on top of that Canadian dollar.
[118:35.91]You know, when I was a kid, I didn't get the concept of...
[118:42.77]currency exchange so I would just laugh my ass off when I picked up a comic book and it said that it was like $15 Canadian and it was like $9 or something American I was like wow sucks to be Canadian I have to pay way more money I didn't know why I thought it was just unfair
[119:13.11]And then I would see stuff, for instance, like the pound.
[119:19.09]I thought that it wasn't fair for me.
[119:22.68]Like, what the fuck?
[119:23.48]How come it's like 30% cheaper over there?
[119:27.13]That's not fair.
[119:39.35]But yeah, thank you, Styx.
[119:41.59]Appreciate it.
[119:43.25]Thank you, Kvas Blackthorn, for the doll of five.
[119:47.03]Hey, Jerma, don't forget the meeting after the stream.
[119:52.23]Just reminding you, Winky Face, much love.
[119:54.03]You're my fave.
[119:54.65]Hey, thanks.
[119:57.01]I gotta go to a meeting.
[119:59.35]Got a meeting after this.
[120:03.13]Ah, yes, the cult meeting.
[120:05.13]Where we drink blood.
[120:08.46]Hold hands and try to bring back Elvis.
[120:11.70]We've done it like 13 times.
[120:13.70]And it hasn't fucking worked.
[120:15.48]Don't ask me why we're trying to do it again.
[120:17.08]I mean, I want him to come back.
[120:20.29]Those fucking hips, you know what I'm saying?
[120:28.35]But thank you Sith Lord for the $1.
[120:30.35]Appreciate that.
[120:31.27]Abdomality thanks for the $5.
[120:35.67]Doesn't work because he's still alive.
[120:42.57]But where is he?
[120:50.76]Where is he, Etalyx?
[120:52.06]Where is he?
[120:59.46]Leave him alone.
[121:00.52]He's in Costa Rica.
[121:05.40]But thank you, Abnormality, for the five bucks.
[121:07.02]Hey, Jerma, do you possibly have sub-accounts that let your friends and family use Xfinity Wi-Fi connections linked to your service?
[121:14.16]Could it be that people are piggybacking your connection, causing Comcast to strangle you?
[121:17.70]I'm sure you haven't... Yes.
[121:20.67]Because this line that I'm using is a dedicated line.
[121:25.07]It's only... It's not Wi-Fi enabled.
[121:32.23]There's no Wi-Fi connection here.
[121:35.20]on this line so it's not possible this is a dedicated business line and uh yeah not so dedicated apparently yeah we'll watch the we'll end we'll end it on that wasp video we're almost done
[122:03.31]But thank you, Abnormality.
[122:04.23]Thank you, Cartnor, for the $1.
[122:05.95]Hey, Jerma, my mom is in rehab and I just got the notice that we're getting evicted.

[124:10.06]That would be remarkable.
[124:10.94]You'd be the first dog.
[124:12.33]You're the first dog that's been able to type on a computer.
[124:19.01]I'm going to make it, though.
[124:19.77]I'll invite you on after I get 50,000 followers.

[124:49.20]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[124:50.60]I think 700,000 games is mathematically the perfect YouTube video.
[124:55.44]That's debatable.
[124:57.88]I love that.
[124:58.64]700,000 games, though.
[125:02.99]Everything about that entire disk was just fun.
[125:06.97]Because it was just such a blatant, dumb lie.
[125:10.13]I loved every second of it.
[125:13.78]Uh, AncientSasquatch, thanks for the $1 jermaOn the topic of being troubled by bugs.
[125:18.64]Here's a little story.
[125:20.62]About half a year ago, I got an adult Jerma cockroach stuck in my ear that died.
[125:27.66]It stayed there for three weeks because it had crawled too far into my ear hole to get it out.
[125:33.89]Apparently rovers communicate using a very low-pitched tone something.
[125:37.12]I really didn't want to learn firsthand Did you get it out was still there That's insane I can laugh at it now, but it was terrible Jesus
[126:05.14]It's controlling him.
[126:07.02]Yeah, now he's in control.
[126:08.94]That's a lie.
[126:10.92]You got inside his brain like Men in Black style.
[126:14.77]That's the cockroach talking, guys.
[126:16.17]That's not Sasquatch speaking.
[126:22.45]But thank you, ancient cockroach.

[126:38.24]What do hornets eat?
[126:38.98]They eat meat.
[126:40.08]They're meat eaters, guys.

[132:15.23]Thanks for being you.
[132:20.55]Thanks for being here.
[132:26.31]I sometimes don't know what to say when I hear that kind of stuff, you know?
[132:34.01]I just hope you know that you guys are all fucking great.
[132:38.00]And that I wish that some of your lives were better.
[132:42.10]I really do.
[132:50.16]And if you can get some enjoyment or some relief from hanging out and watching streams, not just mine, right?
[132:55.70]I know a lot of you guys watch more than one person.
[132:58.76]But even if it is just me, then I hope you feel better.
[133:02.70]I really do.
[133:15.34]Thank you.
[133:18.20]Take care, guys.
[133:22.31]Moo means moo.
[133:22.85]Thanks for the $1 at the very end.
[133:24.07]Miss you all.
[133:25.05]Love you all.
[133:25.75]Have a good night.
[133:26.51]Sorry for being a bad mod and never being able to catch the streams.
[133:32.79]Am I going to have to do like a modpocalypse here?
[133:37.90]I might.
[133:41.46]I might do a modpocalypse soon.
[133:44.64]I mean, it's been a while, hasn't it?
[133:50.47]We might have to do a little modpocalypse.
[133:53.59]Should we bring in some people?
[133:55.09]Change some faces around?
[133:56.11]We might.
[134:07.92]New house, new mod.
[134:13.51]Wait, hang on.
[134:14.07]No, I just got here.
[134:15.81]I just added you as a mod.
[134:20.03]You're safe for at least three days.
[134:22.82]Actually, well, shit, no, it's been three days.
[134:24.58]It's been, like, a few months.
[134:26.40]Oh, shit, dude, you're not safe.
[134:29.32]Like, for instance, Etalyx ain't gonna be a mod anymore.
[134:31.10]He'll be gone.
[134:40.86]No, I'm just kidding.
[134:43.26]But, we'll see.
[134:45.68]Anyways, thank you, everybody.
[134:47.16]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[134:48.62]You're a beacon in the darkness.
[134:51.84]You too.
[134:53.52]Oh, that's what, okay.
[134:54.89]I see what he's doing.
[135:00.53]But thank you guys.
[135:02.87]Have a great night.
[135:03.67]I'll see you on Sunday for the stream that I was supposed to do like four or five days ago.
[135:09.41]A Blind Legend, if you don't know what it is, it's a game that is audio only and you cannot see.
[135:16.66]That's the whole point of the game is an entire RPG adventure based around only using your ears.
[135:24.45]So I'm going to be on camera.
[135:26.04]It's going to be wild.
[135:28.84]Don't miss it.
[135:30.00]Or do.
[135:30.84]Or don't.
[135:34.76]Isn't that interesting?
[135:37.98]Hey!
[135:38.24]Apples are good.
[135:38.78]Thanks for the $1.
[135:39.64]Say spaghetti and meatballs.
[135:40.96]Spaghetti and meatballs are delicious.
[135:44.34]I don't know why you wanted me to say that.
[135:54.37]And let's watch, before we go, the B video by Googley Gareth.
[136:02.48]If you don't know, Googley Gareth is a source filmmaker guy.
[136:05.72]He does very, very good material.
[136:14.04]Let's take a look.
[136:15.24]So I think the thing about, I think going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[136:21.74]Oh, shit.
[136:22.02]Hold on.
[136:22.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[136:22.62]Hold on.
[136:24.96]Wait till he lands.
[136:25.48]Wait till he lands.
[136:28.28]Okay, he landed.
[136:32.42]Ooh, up in smoke.
[136:37.04]Can you cast Obsidian?
[136:41.49]That was fucking great, man.
[136:47.57]Alright.
[136:47.91]Good night, everybody.
[136:48.71]See you on Sunday.
[136:50.61]Take care.
[136:51.19]Much love.
[136:53.04]Thanks for hanging out.
[136:54.39]Good night.
[137:15.61]The Sunday stream will be probably at like 4 or 5 o'clock, but the sus is set to 7 because I'm usually late.
[137:23.38]So I'm giving myself a little extra computer time to make sure I can probably get there in time.
[137:28.20]But it's 7 o'clock before 7.
[137:30.72]See you on Sunday.
[137:32.55]Have a good night.
