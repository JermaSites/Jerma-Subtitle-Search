[ve:61.1.100]

[00:36.89]Hey, what's up?
[00:38.79]How's it going?
[00:42.06]How you doing?
[00:43.62]You doing good?
[00:46.94]That's good.
[00:49.18]Yeah, I've been pretty good.
[00:53.75]I got, uh, I got Dracula 2 to work.
[00:59.03]I just had to do a lot of bullshit, but hey, it worked.
[01:02.77]Oh my goodness.
[01:03.47]I got to move that mic.
[01:05.25]That's not, I got to stop.
[01:06.47]I need to glue my hands to a table or something because I talk so much with my hands.
[01:13.43]I need a microphone.
[01:15.39]You know what I might do?
[01:19.07]I might sacrifice the quality of what this stream sounds like to have, to just have a mic piece just on my mouth.
[01:30.36]I hate this fucking thing.
[01:34.04]We'll talk all about it in a minute or so here.
[01:37.37]Let's get rid of the pre-rolls.
[01:38.89]Pre-rolls are going to... No, not pre-rolls are going to start.
[01:40.93]Ads are going to start here.
[01:44.73]Let's knock them out.
[01:48.43]I'll give you some mic drama.
[01:49.49]Absolutely, yeah.
[02:01.37]Were you a seat filler at the Oscars?
[02:05.01]No, I was not.
[02:06.93]And I... No, I don't want to go to anything.
[02:18.50]No one minds a quality drop?
[02:20.14]I just think it's so much more freeing to not have to have a giant boom arm an inch away from your face.
[02:28.44]We'll talk all about it.
[02:30.10]I'll be right back.
[02:31.36]Ads are going to play.
[02:31.94]See you in a minute.
[02:32.85]So we'll see you in exactly three to four minutes, actually.
[02:36.29]See you soon.
[03:32.37]How it does this?
[03:36.71]It's going to start any second.
[03:37.93]It's going to happen any second.
[03:38.89]The button has been pressed.
[03:42.49]I think the start of the stream, it just, it waits for some reason.
[03:46.26]Extra long.
[03:46.74]I don't know.
[03:48.30]Maybe the stream has to be live for a certain amount of time before.
[03:50.44]I don't know.
[03:52.06]It's going to cut me off in a second here.
[03:54.56]I know it is.
[04:08.03]It doesn't cut me off.
[04:08.65]It's not funny anymore.
[04:17.23]It's not going to cut me off, but this is not funny.
[04:19.41]I just sound like a weird guy.
[04:25.04]Come on, what the fuck?
[04:26.34]Do it.
[04:30.88]What the heck is going on here?
[04:36.18]You are a weird guy.
[04:37.90]No, I'm a weird guy on camera.
[04:39.69]Okay.
[04:46.03]This is funnier.
[04:47.27]Maybe they're not going to play.
[04:51.19]I'm afraid to do anything, though, because I don't want to do anything.
[04:53.41]Because I told you guys I don't want ads to be on any real content.
[04:59.10]They're just going to jump scare us all in a second here.
[05:06.13]Or maybe they won't.
[05:06.77]How's my gamer wart doing?
[05:11.06]Uh, that's fully healed.
[05:14.48]How do you remember that?
[05:15.30]Why are you even bringing that up?
[05:16.12]That's weird.
[05:36.42]uh I don't know why they take so long in the beginning it's weird alright I'll be right back
[06:52.63]Okay, for those of you that heard that, I'm just, listen.
[06:55.88]I don't know what's going on because somebody explained this to me.
[06:58.84]We'll wait for everyone to, we'll get the consensus from everybody.
[07:02.10]But a lot of times, and this is kind of weird.
[07:05.48]Let's wait because this is fucking weird what happens.
[07:09.70]And I want a computer science person to explain to me what's going on.
[07:14.70]I'm just not making this up.
[07:15.98]This is a real thing that's happening.
[07:18.70]And
[07:21.96]should fix it.
[07:22.64]I don't know how to fix it, but we will find out in one minute.
[07:25.90]I'll be right back.
[07:28.26]I got a lot to talk about in the first few minutes of this stream.
[07:30.90]Buckle up.
[07:32.26]Hey, buckle up.
[07:33.48]This one's going to be a wild one.
[07:36.00]We got Dracula 2 opening cutscene.
[07:39.05]Then I've got a truck driving simulation game that I want to play from like 1997 or something or 2002.
[07:43.17]I don't know.
[07:50.52]There's a lot of shit going on today.
[07:52.59]Is it gonna- is it- This could be a- a banger.
[07:56.47]As uh, as the kids say, you know?
[07:59.70]Alright, beer beer.
[08:27.54]Okay, welcome back.
[08:28.90]How are you?
[08:30.14]We've got some things to discuss at first.
[08:32.94]Welcome to the stream, first of all.
[08:34.00]A couple things I want to talk about, and I would like an opinion.
[08:38.79]First thing.
[08:40.83]A lot of times, when I'm sitting down, and I have a keyboard that's on my lap here, and I have a mouse that's right next to me.
[08:49.93]And the setup is, I mean, it's, there's like a, there's, there's wires, I would say.
[08:54.79]There's a few wires going into the computer.
[08:57.65]Uh, but what happens is, is I will get electrically, um, static electricity shocked.
[09:04.90]It'll be like, when I touch the keyboard, either when I get up or when I, um, when I get up or when I sit down.
[09:12.40]and when it does that it the all the peripherals turn off and sometimes my monitor turns off and then it turns back on so I'm like electrically shocking my keyboard and it's like going into the computer
[09:29.81]So what's up with that?
[09:32.57]Cause when you just heard the window sound, that was me.
[09:35.01]I was getting my keyboard on my lap and okay, here we go.
[09:37.53]I'm ready.
[09:38.17]Oh, that was a little electric, just like a, like a static, like electric shock.
[09:42.10]Not a, not a bad one.
[09:43.34]I'm just saying like a little, like you've rubbed a balloon on your head and whatever the back in science class and just went.
[09:51.44]Yeah.
[09:51.56]Everything's grounded.
[09:52.34]Yeah.
[09:55.74]Reboot your computer.
[09:56.74]Is it a fuzzy carpet?
[09:58.30]Not really.
[09:58.96]No.
[10:03.28]Get some rubber keys.
[10:07.97]Maybe it's the chair.
[10:08.81]Maybe the chair might be doing it.
[10:15.13]If it's shocking you, it is not grounded.
[10:20.20]But why is it turning off my peripherals?
[10:24.00]Am I just that powerful?
[10:26.64]You should whiff.
[10:27.24]Whiff.
[10:28.73]OK, I'm going to try this next time I stream and it might actually work.
[10:32.82]I'm going to wear somebody said wear flip flops.
[10:36.33]Should I wear rubber shoes when I stream?
[10:40.33]Vegas is notorious for being crazy dry and static electricity.
[10:45.74]That's not abnormal.
[10:48.14]Guys, at the grocery store, every time I open up the milk refrigerator, like, blue lightning comes out of my hand.
[10:57.62]I don't know.
[10:57.90]Maybe I'm just like an electric person.
[11:02.16]Every time I touch a light switch, it just... I don't know what's going on with me.
[11:12.29]I'm always getting just little tiny.
[11:15.33]Just tiny static shocks.
[11:20.88]We get it.
[11:21.24]You have superpowers.
[11:22.22]I'm not saying I have superpowers.
[11:23.56]I'm just saying.
[11:25.66]Should I wear like a?
[11:27.84]Should I go get my black tourmaline and wear it?
[11:29.72]Is that going to be like anti electricity?
[11:39.14]Isn't black tourmaline supposed to help with fucking rays or something?
[11:44.75]Alright.
[11:45.91]And the second thing, I know I'm stalling, but this is important.
[11:49.31]Can somebody... A couple of the mods might have this answer too.
[11:55.30]Somebody, just, I want to see some recommendations.
[12:00.06]Or, I don't want a headset.
[12:01.82]I hate headsets.
[12:03.26]I just want a fucking shitty microphone that it tapes to my mouth.
[12:06.87]That's good quality.
[12:08.07]That's not connected to a giant boom arm that has to... Oh, let me put it in front of my face.
[12:14.99]Oh, it's so close to me.
[12:16.23]I can't see.
[12:17.63]You guys, hello?
[12:20.28]I hate these things.
[12:21.24]I've always hated these microphones.
[12:26.11]Just get a lav mic.
[12:27.03]Yeah, but what's a good one that doesn't sound like shit?
[12:30.64]I've been out of the audio game for a really long time, so I don't know.
[12:35.48]Get a motivational speaker headset.
[12:37.32]Yeah, but those kind of sound like crap, don't they?
[12:43.74]Alright, you guys ready?
[12:45.26]We're going to watch the opening cutscene of Dracula 2.
[12:52.91]OK, I'm getting to seeing some good recommendations.
[12:57.84]You should call an electrician and a priest.
[13:02.86]And have them work together to find out why I'm being electrically shocked all the time.
[13:12.95]Dude, you gotta... Would they work together?
[13:19.70]You need to get an electric priest.
[13:21.80]Get a priest who's also an electrician.
[13:25.62]As a side gig.
[13:28.78]Steel series wired earbuds with mic on the stick.
[13:32.70]Interesting.
[13:35.21]Use anti-static sheets.
[13:36.45]I use anti-static sheets.
[13:39.33]I think it's just Las Vegas is... Whatever.
[13:41.49]Alright.
[13:41.89]We've been stalling for 15 minutes.
[13:43.07]Are you ready?
[13:44.24]Let's get this opening cutscene going.
[13:47.79]This is the only way I could physically capture this game.
[13:51.17]This is the only way.
[13:52.95]I had to sit here and painfully capture my desktop, because it changes the resolution of my entire computer.
[13:59.82]And I had to painfully exit the game, change this alt tab, change this... It took about 30 to 40 minutes to get this to work the way that I wanted it to.
[14:10.15]So if this doesn't work and this is screwed up, I said this is going to be a fun stream.
[14:15.31]This is going to turn into a mad stream if this doesn't work.
[14:19.73]Okay, so here we go.
[14:23.09]Hold on.
[14:27.12]Alright.
[14:28.14]Everybody say a quick prayer that this is going to work and that I can still see the chat and that everybody can hear it.
[14:36.04]Alright, here we go.
[14:38.74]Here it comes.
[14:41.89]Come on.
[14:50.63]Yes.
[14:51.13]Alright.
[14:53.23]It worked.
[14:53.73]Thank God.
[14:56.43]Alright.
[14:57.63]Everybody quiet.
[14:58.16]Here's the cutscene.
[15:15.91]We just did this flying machine.
[15:19.79]Yeah, I remember this.
[15:58.25]Just a little recap from last night, it's fine.
[16:00.25]Or yesterday.
[16:02.17]The day before.
[16:03.27]This is fucking loud.
[16:30.56]We say that we can never come back from hell.
[16:33.60]This time, a miracle has happened, and it really is a miracle.
[16:38.43]Mina is near me, still unconscious, but alive, and that is the most important thing.
[16:44.85]I don't know how Mina will be marked by this adventure.
[16:48.52]Alright.
[16:48.80]God's on the team now.
[16:49.72]Alright.
[16:50.02]Here we go.
[17:17.62]This is a week after what happened.
[17:20.29]You can read.
[17:20.79]So our friend has returned alive from Transylvania with Mina and the Dragon's Ring.
[17:39.94]He has proved to be a more difficult adversary than I imagined.
[17:44.61]He kinda looks like he's made out of wood.
[18:22.06]What do you think that feels like?
[18:22.96]Do you think he still has thoughts?
[18:27.28]Do you still have a consciousness when you're like this?
[18:29.08]You don't have a brain anymore.
[18:35.77]There's no brain, there's no blood either.
[18:37.13]There's no organs or anything.
[18:43.95]Who is this guy?
[18:44.81]What the fuck?
[18:50.05]Get up and tell me that everything is in place just as I had intended.
[18:54.82]Yes, master.
[18:56.00]Everything is ready, just as you ordered me to do.
[18:59.04]Then let my will be done.
[19:02.38]Nothing can stop me now.
[19:04.76]Nothing and nobody.
[19:08.28]Marius, did you see the Archangel Tyrael?
[19:12.91]Yes, yes, yes.
[19:22.86]Alright, we made it.
[19:23.36]You guys ready?
[19:30.23]Already a week has gone by since we returned from Transylvania, and I still cannot manage to sleep.
[19:36.41]Mina's condition is very worrying.
[19:38.77]The vampire's bite is causing her to have increasingly violent attacks.
[19:43.12]Fortunately, our good friend Dr. Seward is achieving miracles in his fight against this disease.
[19:48.64]They couldn't get a video of that guy?
[19:49.90]That's the only picture you have of that guy on your phone?
[19:54.24]Alright.
[19:54.52]Here we are.
[20:18.51]So this is Dracula's old house or his old laboratory?
[20:22.45]I don't know.
[20:24.83]Does the gameplay the exact same way?
[20:26.40]It's probably the same engine.
[20:27.24]I have a gun this time.
[20:31.44]Wait, they give you a weapon in this one with three bullets.
[20:34.98]This one's going to get interesting.
[20:37.44]Alright.
[20:40.36]Anything behind me?
[20:42.45]No.
[20:42.61]No.
[20:50.95]Alright.
[20:52.77]Pretty standard courtyard.
[20:56.92]Dracula 2.
[20:58.12]The candle.
[21:01.16]Whoosh.
[21:03.58]Nice.
[21:05.06]Okay.
[21:07.55]That's probably... That has to be a casual playthrough world record, by the way.
[21:11.77]Of me finding the first item.
[21:16.80]That was very quick, and that was very deliberate, and it was diligent, and it has to be a casual playthrough world record.
[21:23.44]That one as well.
[21:34.45]Okay, what are these?
[21:37.69]It's like an oil can and a screw?
[21:39.27]I don't know.
[21:48.14]You killing it right now?
[21:49.02]Yeah.
[21:52.08]Thanks, appreciate it.
[21:57.46]This one is a little brighter and I mean, I am outside though.
[22:03.86]Wait, hold on.
[22:06.78]Can I touch this or anything?
[22:07.78]You're on pace for a new PB.
[22:18.79]Can I do the oil can?
[22:19.87]No.
[22:31.01]Oh, there's another one.
[22:32.05]Should I put... Okay, you probably need three of them?
[22:35.70]Four of them?
[22:42.92]I love these games they're they're just easy enough but they're the atmosphere is 10 out of 10. the animation is 10 out of 10. I'm gonna be I'm really happy that there's five of these I'm already sad that there's gonna be eventually an end of this game series
[23:07.43]You know what I mean?
[23:08.07]You ever get like halfway through a series and you go, fuck man, this is going to end.
[23:11.55]This is ending in 30 or 40 episodes.
[23:15.07]I've already seen 30.
[23:16.87]What the hell?
[23:23.89]No, no oil.
[23:25.69]Can I shoot it off?
[23:28.67]I can't wait to use that gun.
[23:30.48]I can't wait to use that.
[23:37.92]You ever played the Siberia games?
[23:42.68]I don't think so, no.
[23:43.86]I've played... We talked about Myst before.
[23:47.15]Myst was way too confusing.
[23:49.79]Oh, hold on.
[23:56.72]Shoot it off?
[23:57.12]Alright, I need something to open that with.
[24:03.22]BioShock?
[24:03.66]I've played all the Bioshocks.
[24:08.73]Actually, me and Holly played Infinite not that long ago.
[24:14.61]Hmm, OK.
[24:17.53]Have I seen everything out here?
[24:18.81]Can I go behind the house?
[24:19.49]There's gotta be something I can do with the door, right?
[24:33.87]Prey is great if you like BioShock.
[24:37.61]I'm down for whatever.
[24:39.84]This is the new era of I'm down for whatever.
[24:43.49]It doesn't even matter what it is.
[24:54.34]What about playing with Play-Doh?
[24:55.36]Alright, that maybe not that, but I mean, I'm not going to say no.
[25:14.61]Hmm.
[25:15.93]Okay.
[25:19.31]What is this key?
[25:20.21]Does this key not go to this?
[25:21.83]I can't unlock it with this?
[25:29.84]Shit, I can't even get in the house.
[25:31.40]I'm already stuck.
[25:49.26]I can't go anywhere else.
[25:57.90]Imagine seeing this guy do this.
[26:08.21]Can you call Dracula for a hint?
[26:10.03]I have an oil can with a door.
[26:12.17]I can't oil the door?
[26:15.19]Really?
[26:21.29]Oh boy, that was embarrassing.
[26:22.45]Let me... The oil... I'm not going to try the key.
[26:37.86]Why would I do that?
[26:53.04]I love an oil can sound.
[26:54.34]That's one of my favorite sounds in the world.
[26:55.68]Okay.
[27:04.53]It's going to go up.
[27:16.83]My door on the left.
[27:19.98]I hear music.
[27:33.22]Hey, nothing there.
[27:34.02]Another Dracula bedroom.
[27:42.00]The domain in question lies in the district of Purfleet and is called Carfax, probably a corrupt form of the Old French, meaning four faces, given that each side of the house faces one of the cardinal points.
[27:56.17]The house is very large and dates from the Middle Ages.
[27:59.63]It may well have been an old mill once.
[28:02.20]There are a small number of houses roundabout, one of which is quite big and of recent construction.
[28:08.00]Who are you talking to?
[28:08.84]This serves as an asylum for the insane and is run by Dr. Seward.
[28:15.69]Who is he talking to?
[28:16.87]Oh boy.
[28:23.11]Contraption?
[28:27.87]Sticks.
[28:28.33]Okay.
[28:32.27]Good.
[28:40.70]Matches.
[28:41.30]This is a coin or a screw head?
[28:46.94]Getting a lot of screws.
[28:58.47]Okay, got a candlestick.
[29:01.30]And got a lot of items right off the bat.
[29:03.38]There's a lot of items right now.
[29:06.38]Last time I got a sickle.
[29:08.92]And that was it.
[29:10.99]I had a sickle for the first hour and a half of the last game.
[29:13.73]So they are... There's a lot of things here.
[29:20.41]Oh, they even play a sound.
[29:23.88]Matches.
[29:33.14]In the desk, no?
[29:36.10]Oh my god, there's too many things.
[29:38.56]What am I gonna do with all this shit?
[29:45.22]Ice cream sandwich.
[29:47.32]Uh, the inside of a lock.
[29:52.10]And a candle.
[29:53.79]Candle holder.
[29:54.47]A compass.
[30:01.79]I can open this.
[30:03.82]Can I?
[30:07.96]How I miss my big feasts, when my guests have tried to cross the chessboard and end up impaled to death when the ground gives way under their feet.
[30:16.70]Today the system hasn't functioned for a long time, but the trap is still there.
[30:20.90]Only the right positioning of the pieces indicates the way to reach the other side safely.
[30:25.66]Chess is a game which ends with the king being put to death, unless the pawn dies first.
[30:31.51]Which is far more amusing.
[30:37.94]And then I just thought these were kind of cool symbols.
[30:41.54]I took a train ride and I noticed, I looked outside, I saw like a cool sign.
[30:44.85]So I just decided to do the H of that sign.
[30:47.33]I'm traveling the globe right now, so.
[30:54.02]Oh dear.
[30:54.46]I'm going to deal with moon phases.
[31:00.99]Carfax.
[31:01.63]It actually is Carfax.
[31:02.96]I thought it was just the way that the words sound.
[31:04.48]I thought it was like a French word or something.
[31:06.64]Like, like... I don't know.
[31:09.73]Carfax?
[31:11.17]Is that a real place?
[31:23.14]Okay, Carfax gives me great satisfaction, and it is a safe refuge where I can drink the blood of my victims.
[31:30.32]That's why I leave my blackguard to watch the house, and in that way, no intruders can go where they're not supposed to.
[31:37.59]But these humans are so useless.
[31:40.03]The secret mechanism I found here is so basic that a child of four could work out how to use it in a few minutes.
[31:45.87]I have nothing but contempt for such a childish race.
[31:49.97]Oh man, I'm already getting made fun of.
[31:53.21]Carfax gives me great satisfaction.
[31:55.73]And it is a safe refuge where I can drink the blood of my victims.
[32:01.96]That is why I leave my black guard to watch the house.
[32:05.76]In that way, no intruders can go where they are not supposed to.
[32:11.03]These humans are decidedly useless.
[32:15.31]The secret mechanism that I found here is so basic that a child of four could work out how to use it in just a few minutes.
[32:24.30]I have nothing but contempt for such a childish race.
[32:28.34]I'm going to cut you off real quick, Dracula.
[32:31.88]Your game that you'd made here is rated M. This is rated M for Mature.
[32:37.89]You need to be at least 17, I think, or 18 to buy this game.
[32:41.59]So I don't know why you're making puzzles for four-year-olds when it's only, I think, 17 and older that can even play this.
[32:49.19]So you don't even know your own fucking audience.
[32:54.83]What is all this stuff?
[32:57.99]Alright.
[32:58.97]So apparently a little kid can figure out this puzzle.
[33:06.39]The secret mechanism is so basic that a child could do it.
[33:11.83]So let's... Well, I've got a lot of items.
[33:20.87]Hold on.
[33:21.31]Might be something weird here.
[33:29.32]I really hope I don't get stuck on that because that's every you all heard it everyone's gonna laugh about it it's gonna be the top clip of the stream is it may look you can't do it hips for a four-year-old oh hold on okay boom uh
[33:57.65]That doesn't go in there?
[33:59.07]What is this thing?
[34:05.26]Should I use it?
[34:09.56]How do I use this item?
[34:12.96]Uh oh!
[34:14.94]Oh, I'm good.
[34:16.98]Okay.
[34:21.61]Why did I do that?
[34:25.53]The candle.
[34:25.75]The candle.
[34:27.17]And the gun has three bullets.
[34:29.49]What is going on?
[34:30.15]This is actually a little bit weird.
[34:32.67]It's okay.
[34:54.10]What is the point?
[34:54.72]Why did I do that?
[34:56.30]There has to be a reason why I did that.
[35:14.63]You only have four hours.
[35:17.29]Why did I do that?
[35:20.31]What if that was a bad... What if I screwed it up?
[35:21.87]Did I softlock myself?
[35:27.82]Because that didn't do anything.
[35:28.64]There's nothing here.
[35:32.82]Oh.
[35:42.07]Nice.
[35:44.23]Can I open the door?
[35:46.87]Can I shoot the door?
[35:49.58]I can't wait to shoot something in this game.
[35:52.30]I'm so happy there's three bullets.
[35:54.70]Alright, I've got a lot of stuff.
[35:58.58]I think this room is pretty clear.
[36:03.14]So, now what?
[36:10.41]I'll see if I can figure out that puzzle for a four-year-old.
[36:16.01]Oh, sure.
[36:16.31]Maybe I should explore the rest of the house.
[36:17.61]Explore the rest of the house?
[36:19.49]Hey, one's in the chat if I should explore the rest of the house, or two's in the chat if I should do the four-year-old puzzle.
[36:32.98]Okay, looks like they have decided.
[36:36.18]Come on.
[36:46.98]Click it.
[36:50.34]Alright, let's see.
[36:52.06]No.
[36:53.96]No.
[36:56.56]No.
[36:59.18]No.
[37:00.85]No.
[37:02.49]No.
[37:05.08]No?
[37:08.58]No?
[37:18.75]I don't get it.
[37:23.43]Shit.
[37:24.13]I thought that was gonna be what I needed to do.
[37:28.10]I tried to shoot it before, but I don't want to use my bullets, but...
[37:35.20]Do I have to load the gun?
[37:38.30]Oh, fuck.
[37:38.72]I have... I got a loaded gun.
[37:47.90]I need to unlock the chain.
[37:50.63]The key doesn't do it, though.
[37:59.77]Shit, so there was probably something else in the house.
[38:04.58]Oop.
[38:10.49]No, I don't think any of this will work.
[38:16.69]Anything else in his weird book?
[38:27.54]What is this for?
[38:28.60]I can't use my inventory.
[38:33.59]A, B, C, D, E. Okay, it's counterclockwise all the way to H.
[38:53.95]The secret mechanism.
[38:55.41]Yeah, there's phases of the moon, but so what?
[39:07.51]There's only one place to go.
[39:18.80]Oh, my God.
[39:19.50]Alright, well, it's like you're not ever going in here.
[39:26.19]But I can... Uh-oh.
[39:30.34]Gun.
[39:47.54]Property of Jefferson Peabody.
[39:50.49]Cemetery of Highgate.
[39:53.71]Ooh, alright.
[39:54.69]Oh my god!
[39:56.13]I don't have any bullets in the gun now!
[40:05.37]What do I do?
[40:07.67]Is that my health or is that his health?
[40:09.53]Whose health is that?
[40:12.38]Whose health is that?
[40:21.20]What do I do?
[40:24.84]I think I killed him.
[40:26.41]I think I killed him.
[40:28.79]I can't.
[40:29.03]There's nowhere to run.
[40:29.67]I can't go anywhere.
[40:31.45]Is that his health up there?
[40:32.38]I think I killed him.
[40:39.77]Okay, I got to figure this out.
[40:41.19]Puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.
[40:42.37]Alright, this thing on the door.
[40:43.49]Nope.
[40:44.33]This thing on the door.
[40:46.27]Matches on the door.
[40:48.20]Matches on the gunpowder.
[40:50.42]Grenade.
[40:52.90]This on the door.
[40:54.04]Gun on the door.
[40:55.54]Got it.
[40:56.92]What?
[40:59.76]I have no bullets left.
[41:01.23]He's still chasing me.
[41:19.54]okay alright very I'm glad I didn't save the game because there's a couple of important things to go over just to break down real quick I have three bullets in the gun and when they're gone they're gone the thing on the top was not his health bar that was a health bar that is a big health bar and I shot the gun and his health bar went down one percent and I was like how the fuck are you supposed to kill this
[41:44.07]So I shot it two more times and I thought that I did bleed damage.
[41:46.49]I thought, I don't know, I thought the game was screwed up.
[41:49.38]That was a timer.
[41:50.88]And when it gets to zero, that's not my health.
[41:53.02]I thought that, okay, that's a timer.
[41:54.04]When it got to zero, I'm dead.
[41:55.18]I'll try it again.
[41:56.76]A lot just happened.
[41:57.74]A lot, a lot just happened.
[41:59.80]So let's go ahead and do that again.
[42:08.27]Did I get, do I have everything?
[42:09.87]Check.
[42:10.43]Can we check?
[42:10.75]Can we check?
[42:13.91]I've got all the items, right?
[42:20.43]The game has dots?
[42:21.45]I really thought the game had dots!
[42:25.14]Oh, I thought the game is so old and it's running on Windows 10 that... it just... something went wrong, but I still killed it?
[42:31.58]I don't know.
[42:32.22]How was I supposed to know?
[42:35.96]So, I'm not gonna shoot it then.
[42:37.53]I think I have to shoot the door.
[42:42.64]You shoot the door, and then you can get in.
[42:48.84]And then, again, I... Remember, I put the gun out, and I clicked him with the gun in my hand.
[42:56.14]And then he hit the... I thought I shot this guy.
[42:59.50]Way too much just happened, and I need a second.
[43:04.63]Okay, here we go.
[43:10.69]Oh, why is he...
[43:14.23]Uh, what?
[43:15.55]Alright, here we go.
[43:23.09]That doesn't work.
[43:26.64]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[43:28.80]Hide.
[43:29.94]Hide somewhere.
[43:30.50]Hide.
[43:31.40]Hide.
[43:32.74]Hide.
[43:34.06]Hide.
[43:34.72]Hide.
[43:36.14]Hide.
[43:36.72]There's nowhere to go.
[43:37.42]I can't hide anywhere.
[43:47.51]Alright, let's do this again.
[43:51.11]I'm glad I saved it here.
[43:52.13]I can't believe they added a Mr. X. There's going to be Mr. X following me this whole game.
[44:20.20]And it made a gunshot sound too.
[44:21.82]Do you see how many confusing things happened in a row?
[44:33.79]What the fuck?
[44:34.93]Okay, I did it.
[44:35.37]I did it, I think.
[44:44.64]You can't get through that, really?
[44:59.27]Don't touch that.
[45:00.17]Alright.
[45:05.59]It's time to... I think I have... There's no timer anymore, so I can... I only have two shots left.
[45:20.58]I think he's gonna hate these games.
[45:21.94]I don't think so.
[45:23.00]I'm... I'm in it for the long haul.
[45:28.12]At the very least, I'm telling you we're going to beat the trilogy.
[45:31.03]We will beat the Dracula trilogy on stream.
[45:34.11]That's one thing I can promise you.
[45:37.93]These games are way too weird to not beat them.
[45:40.35]So what do I do here?
[45:54.36]If you show a vampire a mirror, do they... does it kill them or something?
[45:58.68]Or they just can't see themselves in a mirror?
[46:13.27]Is there one little spot that I can click here?
[46:17.74]They turned to stone.
[46:20.64]Yeah, why can't I see myself?
[46:22.04]That's right.
[46:40.74]Oh my... I gotta build a furniture thing and climb out the window.
[46:50.05]No I don't.
[46:52.76]I'm saving it here.
[46:53.32]He's going to break in any second.
[46:56.22]I might really have to build a furniture thing.
[47:02.89]Alright.
[47:09.25]It's not tall enough.
[47:24.22]This is probably important order here.
[47:26.20]I can't pick up any more of the chairs.
[47:33.65]That's annoying.
[47:43.98]Why is it so hard?
[47:44.62]I thought God joined the team.
[47:47.52]Uh, God is giving me the strength to complete it on my own.
[47:55.05]Don't you know anything?
[48:03.75]God has empowered me to deduce and to reflect on a lot of things and overcome this on my own.
[48:18.40]I don't know what to do about this though.
[48:27.74]I need a crowbar or something.
[48:30.89]Have you ever seen a crowbar or a shovel or something?
[48:52.57]Nothing in the fireplace.
[48:55.99]Oh my God.
[48:56.93]He's very patient out there.
[49:01.13]I will give him that.
[49:08.84]I can't even leave.
[49:10.46]Oh, now I move it and this will kill.
[49:12.30]Okay, now I go here and I move this and he'll get fried.
[49:31.69]Apparently not.
[49:37.53]So now I can move the mirror.
[49:39.26]OK, now the mirror is going to... Now he's dead.
[49:58.66]Got it.
[50:00.54]Nice.
[50:02.12]Alright.
[50:09.97]Anything else with this guy?
[50:13.23]I don't think so.
[50:18.98]What the fuck?
[50:20.00]There's another one!
[50:20.96]There's another one!
[50:22.82]What?
[50:23.44]Was that one talking?
[50:28.03]That one was just talking.
[50:29.05]I think that one had intelligence.
[50:31.43]Like the gremlin that drinks the potion in Gremlins 2.
[50:40.44]It was me talking?
[50:44.90]Well, what the hell?
[50:46.68]How do I aggro him?
[50:49.56]I need to aggro him and then run this way.
[50:59.59]uh okay I don't think he cares that I'm in the room uh can I pull these ones off
[51:29.02]No, what?
[51:32.32]What?
[51:39.62]Well, that was me talking.
[51:42.38]I don't know, I freaked out.
[51:43.66]Okay, so... What if I just walk towards him?
[51:50.51]I can't go this way.
[51:57.79]Wait.
[52:00.08]I can't hide behind this?
[52:01.56]Why?
[52:01.78]Can I pick up the mirror?
[52:26.52]Just hold it up in front of him?
[52:28.76]Where can I... Okay.
[52:36.71]Why did you let me do that?
[52:38.91]That was not smart.
[52:44.17]What can I do here?
[52:44.88]Key doesn't work.
[53:04.14]What do I like on a burger?
[53:07.25]Depends.
[53:07.59]Usually lettuce, tomato.
[53:10.37]Well, no, no tomato.
[53:11.71]I have to be really in the mood for it.
[53:15.33]My Five Guys order is a single patty with cheese, obviously.
[53:23.53]And then A1 sauce, jalapeños, and grilled onions.
[53:38.28]It's... Oh, you can lose the onions and just do the jalapeños, cheese, and A1.
[53:41.88]Those of you that are saying, um, F-tier, wow, what an idiot, this guy sucks and stuff, like, that's fine.
[53:51.26]You'll eat it one day as a meme, because you'll order the Jerma985 fucking burger, whatever you do.
[53:58.18]You'll order it as, like, a joke with you and your friends.
[54:00.94]And, like, you'll each take a bite and go, we were just so wrong.
[54:03.99]And I need to apologize.
[54:12.98]no patty I said one patty I didn't say no patty what they're not gonna know what that is I'm no I'm not saying it's on the menu I'm saying that I'm telling you what my order is so you would go order that as a meme with you and your friends
[54:36.64]I don't know why I'm assuming that you and all of your friends, there's eight of you or something around a table and you're all... I don't know.
[54:42.77]I don't know why... I don't know how many people you know.
[54:45.17]I don't know how often you go to Five Guys.
[54:47.47]I don't know anything about you.
[55:00.56]What about the french fries?
[55:01.56]Yeah, the fries at Five Guys are awesome.
[55:06.30]Because I haven't been there in a long time.
[55:09.20]But do they still fill an entire bag of potatoes?
[55:20.94]Do they still give you a dozen potatoes in the bag?
[55:27.41]It's expensive now.
[55:28.29]That is true.
[55:28.89]It is really expensive.
[55:29.69]Isn't it like 10 to 15 bucks for one burger or something?
[55:34.95]Man, that's, that's a lot.
[55:41.54]It's 20, 15 to 20.
[55:44.44]What?
[55:49.78]20 plus for one, but I, even a couple of years ago, two or three years ago, it was like 13, 14.
[55:55.43]Might be talking about different currency, but damn.
[56:03.58]Expensive.
[56:05.37]Alright.
[56:08.83]But anyways, yeah, that's the thing that I like at Five Guys.
[56:11.44]It's really good.
[56:12.10]Oh, God.
[56:15.34]This is just a puzzle.
[56:20.60]What do I do about this?
[56:22.80]There's only two mirrors in the whole house.
[56:35.98]What's a good milkshake flavor?
[56:37.40]Uh, the chocolate's just good.
[56:38.76]Chocolate or strawberry.
[56:39.70]Alright, let's pay attention again.
[56:43.04]We talked about our hamburgers for the day.
[56:44.44]Um, I'm gonna save it here.
[56:48.77]Because... Oh, boy.
[56:51.83]Okay.
[56:52.53]Um, out the window.
[56:54.95]Maybe I can jump to the... Okay, jump to the chandelier.
[57:09.52]Why am I dressed like this?
[57:27.61]Oh, shit.
[57:28.71]Oh, it's too reflective.
[57:42.82]That's a sound in Bloodborne.
[57:46.38]What is it?
[57:48.92]Who does that in Bloodborne or Dark Souls?
[57:50.48]Oh, what is it?
[57:50.95]What is it?
[57:51.27]What is it?
[57:51.53]What is it?
[57:56.49]Uh, nope.
[57:57.29]It is from Dark Souls 3 or Elden Ring.
[58:02.91]It's the guys that grab their bodies and they light on fire and they go and then they explode.
[58:15.50]They hug themselves and then they turn red and they start running, walking faster than you and then they blow up.
[58:23.68]Bell didn't ring yet.
[58:26.35]Okay, well, I did it.
[58:30.45]Now, I can pull this off.
[58:34.03]Ow!
[58:34.27]Yeah, the flame zombies.
[58:43.79]Uh-oh.
[58:46.46]I would probably advise whoever lives here that you have to sleep in a coffin if you're a vampire.
[58:52.74]I would measure the distance.
[58:55.96]You put this right into the light.
[58:59.64]You just need to scoot it over there.
[59:02.14]Why would you want it directly in the light?
[59:05.14]What are you, stupid?
[59:07.14]Oh, a four-year-old.
[59:08.20]A four-year-old could figure out this puzzle.
[59:11.22]Humans are so stupid.
[59:12.70]The human race is so dumb.
[59:15.31]You put your coffin that you sleep in directly into the sunrise sunlight.
[59:21.25]You're a fucking idiot, actually.
[59:22.45]I look hard.
[59:25.73]Okay.
[59:43.90]This one definitely has a lot more action than the first one.
[59:47.14]This has been intense.
[59:48.96]I have to pull like some kind of mechanism or something.
[60:17.71]There's no indicator.
[60:22.72]Oh, hold on.
[60:28.06]Nice.
[60:28.72]We can do... We can actually go outside and do that puzzle.
[60:31.24]Alright.
[60:35.23]Let's go.
[60:45.73]Bro, are we playing another furry game?
[60:48.35]Is Dracula... Dracula is not a furry.
[60:51.31]Wait a minute.
[60:52.19]Dracula turns into a bat.
[60:54.79]No, that doesn't count.
[61:00.10]No, we already had this argument that a werewolf is not a furry.
[61:05.16]The only way that a werewolf would be a furry is if he had like a baseball cap on, like a graphic tee on, and sneakers.
[61:14.09]No.
[61:14.57]The werewolf is not a furry.
[61:16.43]You are completely wrong.
[61:18.41]And... There's absolutely no... I'm gonna... I will die on that hill.
[61:27.39]That is a... That is a mythical beast.
[61:33.86]These sounds are so loud.
[61:39.78]Was that it?
[61:40.30]Was it that easy?
[61:50.08]Huh?
[61:54.20]Alright, well.
[61:54.60]I'm going to take a break.
[61:56.98]We'll find out when I get back.
[62:00.99]Save it here.
[62:02.33]Get up and move around.
[62:06.21]You can hear the wind sounds for a little bit.
[62:08.31]Because I can't.
[62:09.95]It's another one of those alt-tab games.
[62:11.17]So, I'll be right back.
[62:17.58]See you guys in three to five minutes.
[62:21.14]And ads will play, so just be aware if you're in another tab.
[62:27.97]See you soon.
[62:29.53]See you soon.
[62:30.17]Not see you in a soon. ...
[63:03.09]Thank you.
[63:45.22]Thank you.
[64:28.32]Thank you.
[65:11.85]Thank you.
[65:55.43]Thank you.
[66:59.82]Okay.
[67:01.22]Welcome back.
[67:08.18]So for Christmas, Holly got me these glasses.
[67:12.07]Not eyewear.
[67:15.35]Drinking glasses.
[67:18.01]They're so cool.
[67:24.45]That's why it's funny.
[67:25.77]I want to think about what I wanted for Christmas.
[67:27.39]What do you want for Christmas?
[67:28.27]Well, she said, what do you want for Christmas?
[67:31.23]I don't know.
[67:32.94]A nice glass to drink out of.
[67:37.60]I didn't want an iPhone.
[67:39.08]No, I didn't want to.
[67:39.74]A new keyboard or anything.
[67:42.81]No, I wanted a nice good.
[67:45.97]Thick glass.
[67:50.61]It's got really good design on it.
[67:52.59]These little etched etchings of fishes.
[67:56.95]Really kind of detailed artwork.
[68:00.61]It's beautiful.
[68:02.67]Next time I do facecam, I'll show it to you.
[68:08.45]It's a distinguished gentleman.
[68:10.91]Yeah, a super distinguished gentleman drinking Sprite out of it.
[68:17.01]There's no whiskey in there or anything.
[68:19.47]Yet.
[68:22.13]Alright, let's go.
[68:23.29]So I apparently I don't know what I did.
[68:26.47]I cut this off, but I don't know what to go.
[68:35.53]How do I open it?
[68:49.20]I mean, I cut it off.
[68:50.70]Is it only something on the ground?
[68:54.27]Did something fall?
[68:59.20]Ice or no ice?
[69:00.48]I like ice, but the ice maker in my fridge had broke two years ago and I just never fixed it.
[69:09.24]So we, I just turned it off and we started making our own ice cubes, which is just water.
[69:18.55]what's going on with that by the way I feel like every ice maker and every fridge that I've ever seen always stops working after a year or two of it existing in fact they were actually he was throwing the ice cubes into the freezer you could hear it they were flinging them it would get to a point you'd hear in the middle of the night you'd hear a slingshot just
[69:46.05]And I've cleared it.
[69:46.83]I took it out.
[69:47.35]I did super handyman type shit.
[69:49.43]Took it out.
[69:50.12]Cleaned it.
[69:50.56]Looked at the instructions.
[69:51.58]What do I do?
[69:52.28]Are you going to... There's a frost buildup.
[69:54.20]You're going to break that down.
[69:55.02]I did everything.
[69:55.62]It didn't matter.
[70:00.22]Um... That didn't do anything.
[70:04.36]I'm failing the four-year-old puzzle.
[70:07.58]Because there's no way to... I can't put my fingers in any of this and lift it up.
[70:18.91]I don't have the crowbar anymore.
[70:27.95]Shoot it?
[70:29.82]There's no indicator.
[70:30.56]It's just, okay, you unlocked this with the pliers.
[70:33.58]Now get out of here.
[70:41.20]It's going to be one pixel, isn't it?
[70:49.86]Right there?
[70:50.68]No?
[71:10.68]Oil, maybe?
[71:11.30]I only said oil.
[71:14.50]I mean, I would try stuff, but there's no... The cogwheels means you... This just means you're turning around.
[71:19.40]There's nothing else to see here.
[71:30.56]Maybe I can't do anything else.
[71:32.64]Maybe I have to do something else.
[71:33.70]Maybe it'll open with a different mechanism.
[71:40.19]Let me read his diary again, whatever this is.
[71:46.14]Carfax gives me great satisfaction.
[71:49.68]And it is a safe refuge where I can drink the blood of my victims.
[71:54.28]That is why I leave my Blackguard to watch the house.
[71:58.69]In that way, no intruders can go where they are not supposed to.
[72:03.93]These humans are decidedly useless.
[72:08.22]The secret mechanism that I found here is so basic that a child of four could work out how to use it in just a few minutes.
[72:18.94]Apparently I'm... I'm not smarter than a fifth grader.
[72:22.84]I'm stupider than a four year old.
[72:31.64]Because I don't understand what it wants me to do.
[72:37.06]Uh...
[72:41.13]Okay.
[72:47.71]I can't turn the wheel.
[72:48.83]This is gonna fill with water.
[73:02.93]I can't walk forward?
[73:06.19]It was a green circle when you moved your mouse to the top.
[73:08.75]What?
[73:09.09]Are you serious?
[73:11.55]that's not true then I want you timed out for 30 seconds oh my god give me a little bit this is what we're remember Dracula one remember Dracula one
[73:41.14]It's this spot right here.
[73:43.54]And look, even here.
[73:46.71]Right.
[73:47.27]Hey, click the hinge.
[73:48.29]I can't look.
[73:48.99]I'm on the hinge right now.
[73:50.15]I. I.
[74:07.26]Okay, so... Jeez, even a four-year-old could figure this out.
[74:16.39]Triangle.
[74:17.67]Triangle.
[74:18.63]Triangle.
[74:19.55]Triangle.
[74:20.31]Triangle.
[74:26.51]Uh... There's six spaces.
[74:33.69]Is this gonna be the symbols from his book?
[74:38.91]I think it's all the same symbol.
[74:40.75]Oh, God.
[74:41.57]I can put things here.
[74:44.47]Oh, shit.
[74:51.20]Well, I need six of these.
[75:01.38]A four-year-old is not figuring this out in three minutes, by the way.
[75:12.99]Use the paper.
[75:15.11]Paper!
[75:20.30]Um... How does that help me?
[75:25.92]I still... Okay.
[75:33.06]Dude, a four-year-old is not figuring this out.
[75:34.88]I don't even have the entire... I need the whole piece.
[75:51.61]Are these piano etchings?
[75:53.53]So you feed it into the piano and it goes... And it's like a ghost is playing the piano?
[76:06.70]Oil the paper.
[76:10.00]I'm so glad I looked at chat because there's no way I would have even tried to do that.
[76:13.60]And a four-year-old wouldn't do that either.
[76:22.00]I'm missing a... I need one more screw.
[76:26.59]Alright, so this is man with hand up.
[76:33.57]Okay.
[76:36.20]And this is a person... Got this one.
[76:46.96]That's the other one that I have.
[76:48.46]This is here.
[76:49.32]Alright, I'm missing the... Where do I get that one?
[76:54.86]Fuck.
[76:56.58]Oh, guys.
[76:57.84]Fuck.
[77:07.29]Probably in here.
[77:16.17]Do you think somebody's going to come out of that coffin?
[77:19.47]One in chat if yes.
[77:20.55]Two in chat if no.
[77:21.45]Three in chat if I'm not sure.
[77:24.07]Twelve in chat if... I don't care.
[77:30.36]Just fucking figure it out on your own.
[77:41.51]Do I have a pipe?
[77:42.23]I have this.
[77:43.15]I can't stick that in there.
[77:55.61]I need one more of those little screws.
[78:01.26]I'm done.
[78:06.50]Stick the gun in the pipe and shoot it.
[78:09.49]Oh, God.
[78:13.39]That's some Yosemite Sam Bugs Bunny shit.
[78:18.98]Yeah, Yosemite Sam would be like, oh, you root-tooting bastard, I'm gonna shoot you!
[78:23.56]And he would aim the gun in there, and then Bugs Bunny would, at the top, it goes around, and it's facing Bugs Bunny, and he bends it, and points it, bends it down towards Yosemite Sam, and Yosemite Sam shoots himself in the face.
[78:37.22]That is a classic Looney Tunes routine.
[78:51.78]Alright, there's one pixel I didn't click on and I don't know where it is.
[78:54.82]So we have to find it.
[78:56.40]Yeah, save the game.
[78:57.18]Good idea.
[79:03.01]There's no more of those monsters in the house, right?
[79:18.10]Has Mythbusters ever done an episode on that?
[79:27.37]These, they're in here, aren't they?
[79:28.57]Alright, I can do something with this desk.
[79:30.53]Let me figure this out.
[79:31.13]Hold on.
[79:41.82]They did, unironically.
[79:42.94]Oh, wow.
[79:48.50]What does this want me to do here?
[79:51.88]It still has an indicator on it.
[80:04.11]yeah I was thinking key but no it's not this right no no
[80:31.75]I already did all that.
[80:35.01]Who wins, Bigfoot or Dracula?
[80:38.15]Dracula would be a bat and Bigfoot would just be lumbering around somewhere and Dracula would just land on his back and Bigfoot wouldn't even know that there was a bat on him.
[80:48.59]And then Dracula would just go into his neck and Bigfoot would go and put his hand back to try it, but he wouldn't do it and it would just kill him.
[81:02.91]I'm missing this one.
[81:04.03]It's going to be in such a stupid place, isn't it?
[81:14.43]Isn't it?
[81:22.97]Now, okay, if he's not a bat and it's a one-on-one, then Bigfoot would just do the big boot wrestling move and kick him right in the chest and cave his entire body in.
[81:35.32]It doesn't matter that he's a vampire.
[81:36.62]Like, he would cave his fucking chest in.
[81:42.32]And he'd be immortal and he'd live forever or whatever, but a one-on-one fight, he's not going to win.
[81:54.96]Yeah, Bigfoot would just do an elbow drop.
[81:58.13]And... He would just explode into a bunch of blood.
[82:02.97]And guts and brains and stuff.
[82:23.52]What about Frankenstein?
[82:24.44]Bigfoot kicks the shit out of Frankenstein every time.
[82:27.00]Frankenstein is not scary, okay?
[82:29.34]Frankenstein is... Okay, imagine Michael Myers, but you took a metal bucket and you put it over Mike Myers' head and you just like, with a big heavy wrench and just messed them all up and then pulled the bucket off and then it's like, okay, now go fight somebody.
[82:54.03]Frankenstein is not he's slow he's kind of confused he's rigid he doesn't know where he is if you are within one to two feet of Frankenstein yes but I could get away from Frankenstein I think I would be able to kill Frankenstein absolutely without a doubt I could I would kill Frankenstein without him and I think most people in this chat would be able to as well
[83:21.47]the monster yeah no I'm telling you he's really he's like Mike Myers but slower and stupider guys you could you could okay Frankenstein's monster oh sorry Frankenstein's monster is a type of um monster that would walk into a glass door thinking it was open you're gonna be fine
[83:53.30]OK, so this one, this actually is very, very easy.
[83:56.72]If this is as easy as it seems.
[84:01.48]A child could do this puzzle.
[84:05.84]That was wicked easy.
[84:12.54]What does it do?
[84:21.08]Did I get banned?
[84:24.09]Oh!
[84:28.18]What about the invisible man?
[84:30.73]Invisible Man is still just a man.
[84:32.95]Easy.
[84:34.55]Grab a sledgehammer and just do the move from Dead Rising where you just extend your arms all the way and spin and just hold on tight and just move forward in a direction.
[84:49.77]The Invisible Man is just a man.
[84:53.58]What's he going to do?
[84:55.95]He's going to hide somewhere.
[84:57.27]That's fine.
[84:58.33]You got all day.
[84:59.63]Drink a Gatorade.
[85:00.43]Eat a banana.
[85:06.30]What if he ducks?
[85:07.10]Good luck.
[85:07.86]Oh yeah, duck somebody doing wild swings with a sledgehammer.
[85:11.55]That's going to work.
[85:25.22]Oh, look, there's water.
[85:35.76]Can't do anything here.
[85:46.07]Ooh.
[85:48.21]What if the invisible man has a sledgehammer?
[85:50.55]But then you would see the sledgehammer.
[85:54.47]It would be a floating sledgehammer.
[85:59.89]She was.
[86:09.18]Dracula would never win against him.
[86:10.40]What if he just breaks his neck?
[86:14.32]If Dracula had a sledgehammer in his hand and was spinning around and holding it, extending his arms out, he's going to win.
[86:30.71]Sledgehammer Meadow.
[86:31.57]Yeah, you give me a Sledgehammer, man.
[86:33.96]I'll be fine.
[86:36.04]Sledgehammer can do so much shit, and that's my weapon of choice.
[86:39.62]You can break down walls.
[86:41.18]You can cook with it.
[86:42.64]You can pound out a chicken.
[86:43.75]Fucking make chicken tenders with that thing.
[86:46.09]It's brutal.
[86:47.59]It's heavy.
[86:48.39]It's that thing.
[86:49.29]You give me a Sledgehammer with a zombie apocalypse, I'll win.
[86:52.99]I'll be fine.
[86:55.31]You give me a backpack full of ham and cheese sandwiches, and I'm talking at least 20 of them, and a cooler pack, and I will last a week.
[87:03.22]I'm gonna live for a week.
[87:09.39]I need one dozen ham and cheese sandwiches with an ice pack in there.
[87:13.39]I will live for a week, guaranteed.
[87:23.16]Sledgehammer and a bag of sandwiches.
[87:25.11]I would be unstoppable.
[87:30.31]I can't go any further.
[87:31.01]What?
[87:38.32]What if somebody tried to steal your lunch from you?
[87:41.82]Well, I pick up the sledgehammer and I go one overhand swing and I crush the guy's hand.
[87:49.47]Like, you know, like those old, that old trope of, you know, the Italian mom at dinner, like, get out of here, like whacking with the spoon.
[87:59.04]It's not ready yet.
[88:03.72]I would just overhand crush the guy's hand.
[88:09.72]And then lean in and go, let that be a lesson for you.
[88:29.24]We're not sharing... You guys said if the guy was stealing... This is a hostile person.
[88:32.92]This is not some friend or... They don't introduce themselves like, Hi stranger!
[88:36.70]And then I just crush their hand with a mallet.
[88:38.40]That's... You brought up this was a hostile enemy... This is a person that's trying to get me.
[88:44.94]And steal my bag of fucking ham and cheese sandwiches.
[88:47.51]Uh, how do I get out of here?
[88:55.23]He's invisible.
[88:58.17]He's gotta wear the backpack.
[89:05.98]Am I missing something?
[89:07.24]Did I miss a thing I could do?
[89:20.46]What mythical monster could you not defeat?
[89:23.84]Um, a dragon?
[89:25.54]Anything in the water.
[89:26.80]That's my weakness.
[89:27.60]In the water.
[89:28.04]What are you going to do with a sledgehammer in the water?
[89:31.10]No.
[89:31.74]I would avoid the water at all times.
[89:33.18]If anyone wanted to cross water, I would be the party member that you left behind.
[89:43.13]I would find a land-based way to get there.
[89:48.66]Yeah, anything huge.
[89:49.80]Anything that's ten times larger than a human.
[89:57.63]Alright, what can I even do in here?
[89:59.13]There's gonna be a button on the wall and it's gonna be one pixel again.
[90:03.13]Let's consult the... Let's consult the manual.
[90:18.12]I think if Frankenstein's monster came at me and I had a sledgehammer, I think I would beat him.
[90:24.15]Guys, I would do one big spinning strike and it would hit him right in the side of the head.
[90:27.45]It would just fucking be over.
[90:32.77]Let's be spinning with that thing.
[90:42.20]And then it's just right on the head.
[90:54.43]Oh, look, a gate.
[91:01.39]What if he had a sledgehammer too?
[91:02.55]Alright, I'm going to move on from this after I answer this question because it is a very simple answer.
[91:07.50]Frankenstein's monster is so stupid.
[91:09.66]He would hold the sledgehammer and be questioning it.
[91:15.52]He wouldn't understand.
[91:16.12]He would be looking at it.
[91:17.04]It would be a new touch for him.
[91:19.33]It'd be a new metal.
[91:21.07]He'd just go, he wouldn't know what to do.
[91:25.45]All he knows what to do.
[91:26.61]All he knows how to do is just like grab with two big hands and like squeeze.
[91:31.79]That's all Frankenstein knows how to do.
[91:34.19]He knows how to squeeze and like grab, but he doesn't do anything else.
[91:44.52]That's wrong.
[91:45.30]It's not wrong.
[91:47.12]He's smart.
[91:51.67]What depiction of Frankenstein's monster have you seen where he's... smart?
[91:57.83]I could go up that!
[91:59.61]I clicked it a hundred fucking times!
[92:05.83]Okay.
[92:07.78]In the book?
[92:10.16]He's smart in the original, in, in, uh, in what?
[92:13.20]In the original Mary Shelley?
[92:24.78]How smart?
[92:25.82]What are we talking?
[92:26.68]Are we talking like a third grade level, second grade level, fourth grade level?
[92:31.62]The only Frankenstein I know, guys, is the one that's on... Is the green guy during Halloween when Target has all the toys.
[92:39.91]And the fake funny gravestone and it's Frankenstein's face and he's green and he's a cartoon.
[92:46.01]If Frankenstein is a genius, Frankenstein's monster.
[92:48.39]I'm not talking about the scientist.
[92:53.63]Okay.
[93:24.30]The monster is a genius in the book.
[93:28.36]So why did they, every depiction since that book, make him like, ah, be angry.
[93:34.00]Ah, that's all he is in all, every depiction besides the book.
[93:42.02]That's Hollywood.
[93:42.88]Hollywood made him stupid.
[93:52.43]Okay, so the Hollywood version of Frankenstein's monster is the one that I could beat with a sledgehammer.
[93:58.45]Um...
[94:23.37]Jonathan, at last you're here.
[94:25.23]They were so worried.
[94:28.42]I'm here and I'm alright.
[94:30.24]So then, what did you discover?
[94:32.98]It seems that Carfax is not quite as deserted as we thought.
[94:37.71]I see what you mean.
[94:39.45]I've been noticing some very odd things there for some time now.
[94:43.57]All this is becoming rather disturbing.
[94:51.58]Do I really have to ask him what matches do?
[94:55.06]These things are... Yeah, they're red on the end and they've got wood on them.
[95:01.57]I don't know.
[95:02.13]I'm trying to figure out what these do.
[95:04.93]They kind of smell.
[95:05.73]Are these... Do you put these toothpicks or... Does the name Styx mean anything to you?
[95:13.45]It's the river of hell in Greek mythology.
[95:16.13]But I think it's also the name of a theater in London, isn't it?
[95:20.21]That guy's eyebrows are hanging off of dear life, by the way.
[95:43.34]It's a fact that we cannot ignore, but it's very unlikely that the Styx is our principal target.
[95:48.64]To defeat Dracula once and for all, we have got to find his lair and strike at the heart.
[95:54.02]Jeez.
[95:54.26]Is everybody crunching, really?
[96:07.38]Is my wife eating very loud?
[96:12.87]Were those loud crunches?
[96:17.62]Have you found anything out about that ring that I brought back?
[96:20.24]She's eating carrots.
[96:20.90]I've been able to reconstruct its history thanks to Mina, who has transcribed the wax cylinders which were recorded as a favor to me by a historian friend of mine.
[96:30.58]My attacks are so frequent that I don't have much time to work, and Seward insisted that I rest, but I wanted to help you.
[96:38.11]What have you discovered?
[96:39.19]The last known trace of the ring was back in 1442.
[96:41.31]That was a weird way to drink that.
[96:43.38]It seems it belonged to Radu, a Romanian prince and the half-brother of Dracula.
[96:48.40]But there's more to it.
[96:50.41]Apparently, the ring is incomplete.
[96:53.42]In fact, in the engravings described, the ring is shown with a kind of diamond in its center.
[97:00.24]According to my friend's documents, this stone had the virtue of counterbalancing the evil side of the ring.
[97:06.53]We don't know anymore, but it's certain that Dracula will do everything he can to get it back.
[97:15.63]How do you become a count?
[97:17.95]What a baller title that is.
[97:22.02]I want to go back to where people are counts.
[97:24.84]Count Dracula.
[97:25.97]Count Jeremy.
[97:29.07]I want to walk around with a cane.
[97:31.71]That has a big red orb on it or something.
[97:34.29]And wear a big hat.
[97:37.11]And be in a big suit and stuff and be Count Jeremy.
[97:43.41]Why don't we do that anymore?
[97:46.71]Why don't... Oh my god, I just punched the mic again.
[97:48.95]I'm going to put my hand down here and I'm never going to raise it again.
[97:59.45]They still exist.
[98:06.64]That's literally what your Generation Lost character was.
[98:10.30]Yeah, and it was fun to be, I don't know, I want to be like a count.
[98:20.55]Just dress like that.
[98:22.49]No, you can't just dress like that, because then you're the weird guy on the subway.
[98:27.13]I don't want to do... Then people start, like, taking pictures of you nowadays.
[98:31.38]Like, people would just record you now.
[98:33.58]Oi, look at this weird guy I saw.
[98:36.46]I'd be on, like, TikTok and YouTube short.
[98:39.17]Like, it would just be... People would just be filming me everywhere.
[98:45.55]It would be so... It would be too abnormal.
[98:51.58]You gotta find cool people to hang out with.
[98:53.58]I just don't know what to do now.
[98:54.81]Mina, if you aren't too tired, perhaps you and I could have another try at hypnosis.
[99:00.57]I'm ready to do anything rather than stay under Dracula's yoke forever.
[99:04.45]Doctor, let's go.
[99:06.31]Your eyes are closing.
[99:09.37]Your spirit is roaming free.
[99:12.03]What do you see?
[99:12.69]I see... Oh, it worked instantly.
[99:15.29]...a garden of stone.
[99:19.66]He's coming to find me.
[99:22.02]I can hear voices.
[99:22.92]They'll make me go mad.
[99:24.52]Help me!
[99:26.61]Mina, you will sleep now.
[99:29.69]Sleep.
[99:31.53]Sleep.
[99:33.13]She describes the same scene at each session.
[99:36.04]I think the stone garden must be the cemetery at Highgate.
[99:40.52]Highgate, you say?
[99:42.02]Now that Mina is asleep, I can tell you that my visit to Carfax nearly cost me my life.
[99:47.33]But a man called Peabody was not so lucky.
[99:50.01]I found his body, and it seems that he worked at Highgate.
[99:54.15]Peabody, dead?
[99:56.17]He was investigating on my behalf.
[99:58.80]He said that he had seen some strange goings on near a tomb decorated with a stone wolf.
[100:04.68]It's more than likely that the cemetery is where Dracula has his secret sanctuary.
[100:08.48]Okay.
[100:09.82]Take this key and go over there.
[100:12.38]It will be safer to go via the sewers.
[100:15.01]I shall stay here with Mina.
[100:18.29]I love this game.
[100:19.17]These games are so wonderful.
[100:23.63]I love that though.
[100:24.61]Okay, we'll start the hypnosis now.
[100:27.23]Okay, you're getting very sleepy.
[100:29.19]Okay, now tell me everything.
[100:30.73]Sure!
[100:31.01]It just worked.
[100:33.19]The guy just literally said that and that was it.
[100:38.39]Wasn't enough time to go to take a nap.
[100:40.65]Wasn't enough time to fall asleep.
[100:42.39]Wasn't enough time to close your eyes.
[100:51.08]Oh, I guess I gotta go back in the sewer.
[101:00.74]How do I get in here?
[101:21.46]I was trying to be disgusting on purpose.
[101:25.22]But it ended up being way worse than I thought it was going to be.
[101:30.13]I was trying to do like a Barney burp, but that was one of the worst things I've ever come out of my mouth.
[101:46.22]A fucking sprite, man.
[101:53.06]I thought I could do that with a sprite.
[101:54.52]What am I, crazy?
[101:58.40]Every time I drink a Sprite, it just turns to foam in my body.
[102:03.40]How do I open this?
[102:08.16]That sounded like the end of a toilet flushing.
[102:10.72]Alright.
[102:11.63]How do I... How do I get in here?
[102:28.27]Leave through the front door, dude.
[102:29.57]He said go back in the sewer.
[102:43.57]Both of these doors are blocked.
[102:45.49]I can't leave.
[102:46.43]I have to go in the sewer.
[102:50.24]I've clicked in everything.
[103:05.46]No?
[103:06.44]I'm spam clicking all over this.
[103:07.92]Oh my god, was the key to this door or something?
[103:39.80]There was some grunting?
[103:42.72]Wait, is it... There is... I hear Sanzu.
[104:00.12]I'm gonna go crazy.
[104:00.98]This is... What is going on here?
[104:07.12]He keeps missing the corner?
[104:10.28]I can't... Okay.
[104:11.50]I cannot go lower than this.
[104:13.02]Alright, if I shot this, it would just bounce back up and hit me in the head.
[104:27.90]Window inside.
[104:29.18]Window inside.
[104:29.92]Ugh.
[104:54.36]But this is the sewer.
[104:55.44]What?
[104:55.62]This is so dark, it's so hard to see anything.
[105:00.36]I'm gonna get lost in here.
[105:12.91]Oh god.
[105:26.52]What is that?
[105:27.04]Is there a floating ball of darkness?
[105:31.92]Okay, I don't have anything for that yet.
[106:01.49]I see something.
[106:04.43]I'm not messing around, no way.
[106:05.47]Okay.
[106:21.45]Turn this?
[106:21.89]I need a wrench or something.
[106:33.84]Alright, remember where this is, because I will not.
[106:36.24]Guaranteed.
[106:38.28]Somebody write this all down.
[106:39.70]Somebody draw a whole map of this whole place.
[106:42.47]And then you'll be like, oh, I drew that map.
[106:44.43]And I'll go, oh, really?
[106:46.05]But I probably just will forget to click it.
[106:48.91]And I just won't use it.
[106:50.37]But I appreciate it, though.
[106:51.87]Thanks for doing the map.
[106:58.19]Don't actually do that, by the way, because I probably won't look at it.
[107:01.42]I appreciate it.
[107:04.00]Fuck, I just like, I manifested it.
[107:06.52]Alright.
[107:20.03]Hmm.
[107:36.31]Is there a place to go this way?
[107:37.41]No.
[107:37.53]Okay.
[107:40.93]Well, I have the valve thing now.
[107:44.20]What do I do with that?
[107:45.30]Too dark?
[108:03.46]To stop a gay bend, take control and press the gay bend.
[108:06.20]To stop a gay bend, take control and press the gay bend, gay bend, gay bend.
[108:10.63]Who remembers that?
[108:12.17]That's some old 2012 YouTube humor.
[108:35.02]Gaben, Gaben, Gaben, Gaben, Gaben, Gaben, Gaben, Gaben, Gaben, Gaben, Gaben.
[108:40.10]We thought the Gaben was like the funniest thing ever.
[108:42.16]Hmm.
[108:56.78]I don't know.
[109:05.91]At valve software dot com.
[109:07.65]Yeah.
[109:15.29]Well, I don't know what to do with this now.
[109:17.53]Was there a place outside of the sewer I could put the valve?
[109:27.72]I can't turn that.
[109:29.18]I need something to turn it with.
[109:32.18]Yeah, I can't turn this.
[109:35.66]Unless can I, and I just don't.
[109:37.10]It's a weird item that I have.
[109:52.47]Can't interact with this thing.
[109:57.57]In addition, that's how you got it.
[110:02.03]Shoot it.
[110:06.48]Something poking out of the wall?
[110:12.57]Not really.
[110:18.09]They've done that a few times in this game though.
[110:19.53]There's been an item just right here.
[110:21.33]It's a wood.
[110:31.70]Shit.
[110:36.34]I don't know.
[110:46.85]Can you brighten the game?
[110:48.85]I don't think so.
[110:50.59]I don't think there's a setting.
[110:51.35]I would have to do it through broadcast software, but I'm capturing my desktop.
[110:59.06]So I don't even know if gamma would work.
[111:04.42]It would probably look awful.
[111:09.07]Hey dude, I'm sorry I called you Omega Stupid in the Breath of the Wild water shrine two years ago.
[111:13.88]Well, I haven't gotten over it yet, so.
[111:17.56]That hurt.
[111:18.36]It hurt me when you said that.
[111:20.28]That hurt.
[111:29.65]I don't know what to do.
[111:30.19]I think I've been everywhere.
[111:32.81]Yeah, I can't go this way.
[111:41.07]You just reopened the wound.
[111:49.57]Let it go.
[111:50.01]Sorry, they said you're going to be streaming in hell on that wow stream.
[112:09.35]That's OK though.
[112:12.09]Well, I mean, no, it's not.
[112:13.25]What?
[112:13.59]No, I just said a random sentence because I was focusing.
[112:18.27]That was a filler sentence to just tell you that I was focusing on something.
[112:24.32]What do I do?
[112:26.26]Matches?
[112:26.74]Let's throw a match out here.
[112:28.12]I don't have a lantern or anything.
[112:46.99]What is a grab bag?
[112:48.23]Like get money?
[112:50.26]No, just like a random bag of stuff and could be anything in there.
[112:58.74]Any helpers?
[113:10.55]Come on.
[113:12.39]There's going to be one helper here.
[113:15.84]The one contrarian is going to say, um, it's on the wall over on the left.
[113:23.79]And they're going to feel kind of bad about it, but I'm asking for help.
[113:27.23]And some of you are going to answer that call.
[113:33.16]Wait, that actually might be a good idea.
[113:34.54]That's not even a helper and it might be, it actually might work.
[114:06.23]Somebody said, I'm at work, bro.
[114:08.97]But, and then they told me what to do.
[114:14.01]Okay, so here I am.
[114:22.88]Somebody just changed monitors and like, just typed in the guide and was like, God damn it.
[114:29.44]I got to get, this has got to be on somebody's desk in an hour.
[114:31.60]And this guy's asking me to give him puzzle hints.
[114:42.38]It is very dark down here.
[114:43.53]So I would imagine it could be here.
[115:00.93]He's not even reading the hints.
[115:03.05]Go to that tunnel on the left.
[115:05.55]There will be a something about whatever.
[115:11.77]Just why can't you just read a wiki?
[115:14.27]Because if I open the wiki, I will cheat forever and I don't want to.
[115:21.77]I didn't.
[115:22.05]I didn't even cheat.
[115:22.91]I didn't even see this.
[115:28.09]Oh my God.
[115:33.26]Okay, well, I got the rope.
[115:39.14]You cannot give me shit for that one.
[115:41.62]That was ridiculous.
[115:48.53]Let's go.
[115:50.93]Let's fucking go.
[115:52.21]Let's fucking go, right?
[115:53.17]Hold on.
[115:54.33]Let's fucking go.
[116:03.97]Army four-year-old could do that.
[116:10.02]Just wait till he gets to the bloody door.
[116:18.02]I actually can't get through this.
[116:37.06]nice I can't take that one too yeah I would I would want to be either sledgehammer or uh lightning shooting out of my hands those are the two powers that I would want
[117:08.51]Like Thor.
[117:09.19]Well, no, not like Thor.
[117:11.93]Thor has super strength and he's a god.
[117:15.34]And his hammer is small.
[117:17.42]I'm talking about big sludge hammer.
[117:19.80]Like a construction site sludge hammer.
[117:22.62]And then the Sith Lord lightning.
[117:27.67]The one where he leans back and then arms go out.
[117:30.97]That one.
[117:41.03]So why would I need a second one of these?
[117:42.33]I don't know, the door?
[117:43.85]Or is there another place to put this?
[117:59.39]Sith Lord.
[117:59.89]Okay, I would be a good Sith Lord.
[118:04.95]I could control it.
[118:06.03]I could handle it.
[118:07.01]I've made this exact joke like five years ago.
[118:10.75]I know it.
[118:11.43]It's coming back to me.
[118:16.52]I've made the, I could handle the powers of the Sith and still be good.
[118:19.90]That's what they all say.
[118:24.40]I actually think I probably could.
[118:34.05]That was Anakin's exact argument.
[118:39.01]He was like mad.
[118:40.17]He was always raging at something.
[118:42.93]I would just be stupid.
[118:43.75]I just wouldn't be able to get puzzles done.
[118:55.94]Anakin's exa- Oh my god, it's right here.
[118:58.54]Anakin's exact argument.
[119:04.90]Okay, so... So, turn it.
[119:19.04]What was that for?
[119:19.70]Darth Elbertson.
[119:25.20]You can't be stupid and a Sith Lord.
[119:26.94]Well, I'm... Okay, I'm not stupid, though.
[119:37.60]Omeglel.
[119:38.52]The Omeglel immediately.
[119:40.60]What do you even know?
[119:41.43]What do you know about my test scores?
[119:42.79]What do you know about my... My emotional intelligence?
[119:46.13]My... My practical intelligence?
[119:48.59]My street smarts?
[119:50.57]It's not just about... Well, you see, um, I read a book, and that book told me to write that down, so I wrote that down, and that's what I wrote on the paper.
[119:58.66]This... Excuse me.
[120:10.08]Can I press this button?
[120:15.91]Let's be real, you would be Jar Jar Binks.
[120:18.63]What?
[120:26.16]Uh... How do I... What do I... Why did it want me to do that?
[120:33.38]No.
[120:34.14]I would be...
[120:41.73]The comic relief character.
[120:44.27]The shit that I talk on stream and the jokes that we do on stream... This is not inductive to my character.
[120:54.09]We're hanging out.
[120:55.19]We're taking the piss.
[120:56.49]We're fucking around.
[120:57.93]I would be able to handle the dark side.
[120:59.22]That's what I'm telling you.
[121:06.32]Good.
[121:07.10]Everybody... They got the joke.
[121:09.10]They're putting it in quotes.
[121:10.26]They figured it out.
[121:12.37]God.
[121:16.57]How it feels just to be so much smarter than everybody.
[121:23.23]Which way do I go?
[121:24.61]Which way do I go?
[121:33.86]I... Alright.
[121:36.54]It's already been another hour.
[121:38.84]We're having too much fun.
[121:45.33]Why are you so full of hate and spite?
[121:48.55]Yes, yes, let it run through you.
[121:52.51]And then after it runs through you, let the hate take over you, and then control it, and then be a good guy.
[121:59.31]That's what I would do.
[122:10.30]That's Thanos.
[122:14.08]Not every single- okay.
[122:18.00]You'd be an Ewok.
[122:21.18]Can the Ewok shoot lightning out of his hands?
[122:22.56]Alright, I'll be back.
[122:32.17]Give me like three or four minutes.
[122:34.02]How's it going to play?
[122:34.54]See you in a minute.
[126:28.02]Welcome back.
[126:31.60]Oh, Jerma, Jerma.
[126:32.98]You know that you're going to eat a banana?
[126:34.74]Oh, you like bananas?
[126:35.60]Did you know that bananas are radioactive?
[126:37.41]Are you sure you want to eat that?
[126:39.21]Bananas are radioactive.
[126:41.79]Oh, yeah?
[126:43.29]So is this.
[126:43.95]Okay.
[127:03.16]Did that even come through the mic?
[127:09.00]I'm not sure that actually went through the mic.
[127:12.69]It didn't come through the mic?
[127:15.91]Wait, what?
[127:21.09]You didn't hear this?
[127:33.81]Oh, my voice was taking it over.
[127:36.37]Oh, well, just imagine that was playing when I said that.
[127:49.22]What is that?
[127:49.62]It's a lightning, um... Whatever, you don't need to know.
[127:56.28]Average Jerma rant.
[127:57.66]Okay.
[127:58.34]I'd be Judas, but I wouldn't betray Jesus.
[128:07.19]alright let's let's continue this puzzle game please I'd be judas but I'd have lightning hands and I would have a lightsaber and I wouldn't betray anybody right is that is that closer to the uh what you were looking for
[128:35.53]Alright, so what happened here?
[128:36.37]I put the valve on that thing.
[128:41.08]I can't turn it, though.
[128:50.38]I could screw it back on, but what do I do about this?
[128:58.70]Okay, that was 51%, but what were the other ones?
[129:00.78]What was the next highest?
[129:01.60]Because that's the real one.
[129:06.36]That's the joke one.
[129:07.00]Everyone's going to do the joke one, obviously, because everyone's so immature here.
[129:10.46]They're going to pick Jar Jar Binks.
[129:13.10]C-3PO was the next one?
[129:17.93]No way.
[129:18.91]I'm sorry.
[129:19.59]I'm not C-3PO.
[129:23.03]You guys think I hear all the time that I'm, oh, he's kind of like a doofus.
[129:27.89]C-3PO was not a doofus.
[129:29.23]He had an IQ of like 200.
[129:31.42]Actually, you know what?
[129:31.92]Fine.
[129:32.14]Good.
[129:32.50]I'll be C-3PO.
[129:33.18]That's fine.
[129:42.60]God damn it.
[129:43.28]It actually is kind of accurate.
[129:44.68]Can he have a weapon though?
[129:46.24]Can you give C-3PO a sledgehammer and can I fight stuff sometimes?
[129:52.95]C-3PO was a doofus.
[129:54.47]No, he wasn't.
[129:55.11]He was incredibly important and he did a lot of good things for the rebellion and he just kind of walked funny.
[130:12.69]Alright, what is on the ground here?
[130:15.51]I only know there's something on the ground because one of my mods told me there was something on the ground.
[130:19.37]There's supposed to be another wrench somewhere?
[130:31.75]Oh shit.
[130:37.34]C-3PO is canonically dorky.
[130:42.41]Yeah, guess what?
[130:43.23]So was Anakin.
[130:43.99]Anakin was a fucking dork too.
[130:49.89]Need to find the pixel.
[130:51.21]Oh god, I think it actually is find the pixel.
[131:02.29]The only one that probably wasn't a fucking geek was Mace Windu.
[131:06.60]He was cool.
[131:10.39]And by the way, he was completely right.
[131:16.17]He got... he got fucked so bad.
[131:35.74]If there's a wrench on this ground...
[131:39.38]And I haven't seen it yet.
[131:43.52]I might pee.
[131:52.37]Right behind you.
[131:59.94]In your pants?
[132:00.64]No, eventually, in like an hour.
[132:08.76]Open the toolbox.
[132:09.52]Yeah, I can't seem to get the toolbox open again.
[132:11.30]There's no... There's no spot to open it.
[132:16.66]I'm just spam clicking right now.
[132:17.79]What about this other toolbox?
[132:22.95]C-3PO is in hell.
[132:24.05]Alright, now that you're just... You're just saying anything in chat.
[132:28.41]You're just writing any words in chat and pressing enter.
[132:36.65]Hey, you know, back in the day, you know, back like 20 years ago, that was 10 cents.
[132:42.39]Think about it.
[132:42.79]Think about that.
[132:43.49]You, all you guys writing right now, 10 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 5, 10 cents, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 cents, 10 cents.
[132:58.89]Am I in the right spot?
[132:59.94]Is it, am I, am I sitting in the right location or is there a different wrench location?
[133:04.32]You can turn the wheel.
[133:05.14]I swear to God.
[133:06.16]Okay.
[133:08.14]But how?
[133:16.00]What the hell?
[133:20.74]So what?
[133:21.08]Alright, well, I guess it drained the liquid.
[133:30.40]So what is, who cares?
[133:31.38]Can I go down there?
[133:39.29]Oh, I can go.
[133:39.99]That might be the area I can go to now.
[133:43.47]Bro, can you please stop with the middle school lunch table conversations?
[133:46.39]We're all adults here.
[133:53.94]What's an adult conversation you want to have?
[133:56.80]What's a good adult conversation to have?
[134:03.00]I thought I was going to get rid of this, but I didn't.
[134:09.71]taxes fuck oh yeah I can't go down here either this doesn't does Dracula do taxes
[134:40.63]Yeah, how does Dracula pay for all this?
[134:44.11]Does Dracula have a shell company or something that he puts all of his money in?
[134:47.58]But how does Dracula make money?
[134:49.26]He's Count Dracula.
[135:01.78]His generational wealth.
[135:04.60]Scams and mind control?
[135:10.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[135:11.58]Dracula is just a scammer.
[135:13.02]Is that accurate?
[135:17.00]Who has more taxable income?
[135:18.32]Dracula or Frankenstein?
[135:20.28]Dracula.
[135:20.82]Dracula owns 10 estates.
[135:22.75]Frankenstein has a shirt and ripped up pants.
[135:25.81]And he's green and he gets angry.
[135:36.60]I just saw a indicator.
[135:38.42]What was that?
[135:42.60]Yeah, when Frankenstein gets pissed off, he goes, and his shirt rips off and his purple fucking tight shorts rip too.
[135:50.87]We gotta have that happen.
[135:56.83]What did I even do?
[136:20.26]What the heck?
[136:31.24]I just did.
[136:31.74]I can't.
[136:32.38]Can I drop down?
[136:33.34]Oh please.
[136:45.10]What?
[136:52.36]Okay, but so what?
[136:53.38]Do I... I can't pick it up from this side.
[136:59.62]Count Dracula or Count Chocula?
[137:03.27]Uh, Count Dracula.
[137:05.07]Count Chocula eats cereal.
[137:06.99]And... That's all he does.
[137:11.17]And sometimes he turns into a bat.
[137:19.09]What the fuck?
[137:21.49]Alright, I made it.
[137:31.83]Now what goes in the corner here?
[137:37.05]Why would it tell me to do this?
[137:39.61]Count Dracula or Count from Sesame Street?
[137:43.03]No, what you should have said is Count from Sesame Street or Count Chocula.
[137:46.08]Those are on the same tier.
[137:51.82]I think the Count from Sesame Street would be diplomatic.
[137:56.49]And it wouldn't be a fight.
[138:05.42]Use the ladder?
[138:06.02]I don't even have the ladder anymore.
[138:07.84]Where did it go?
[138:08.40]I was talking and we were... Okay.
[138:27.53]I was talking and wasn't looking.
[138:28.65]Okay.
[138:33.76]Cool.
[138:48.99]is going on dude where alright where am I what where am I I need to say give me a second is there only two places the ladder can be placed okay the ladder can only be placed in those two places very cool we're going through here there's only one place where the ladder can go
[139:14.75]And it's only here, so I have to go up and there ain't nothing here.
[139:20.23]Oh my God, I didn't think I could reach that.
[139:26.04]Hold on a second.
[139:27.50]Let me aim this.
[139:30.68]I sure you get it right.
[139:31.44]You can shoot through the grate, you idiot.
[139:33.28]What if you just miss?
[139:35.36]I don't want to shoot.
[139:35.94]I only have two bullets left.
[139:43.06]Do I actually have to shoot the grate with two bullets in the gun?
[139:56.55]I have one major criticism of the game so far.
[140:01.30]It's just one.
[140:03.45]This was in our inventory at the very beginning of the game.
[140:06.61]And we got three bullets.
[140:08.37]And it's holy shit we got a gun this time.
[140:11.41]It has only been used to shoot a lock off of the door.
[140:16.06]Twice.
[140:17.14]That means there's one more bullet in here.
[140:23.10]Why even have a gun?
[140:25.26]Why have a gun?
[140:27.22]Why not have a slingshot or a key ring?
[140:32.56]We're not going to shoot Dracula with that thing.
[140:34.14]It's only been to open doors.
[140:50.13]This place is pretty big.
[140:59.44]Guys, I have a Reuben sandwich in the fridge.
[141:03.56]And I am just dreaming about it.
[141:10.33]Okay, another ladder.
[141:11.31]And it's got, it's got like slaw on it.
[141:22.69]Ugh.
[141:27.89]I've been eating so... just safely the last three or four months.
[141:33.38]The last week or so, I just kind of said, I don't even care.
[141:43.99]I got some more doctor's appointments coming up.
[141:45.33]Don't worry.
[141:45.89]I'll be alright.
[141:51.87]I do have another ladder now.
[141:59.41]Up here.
[142:02.05]Can I?
[142:02.39]Well, I can climb this with the ladder.
[142:03.60]I can't just put this over here and climb it.
[142:19.34]You can play Deltarune Chapter 3 this year.
[142:22.99]I would want a refresher on that whole game because it's been so long that I just don't remember anything.
[142:28.07]I remember Spamton.
[142:28.99]I remember the couple that I remember Jevil, right?
[142:37.35]I would definitely, I mean, it was great.
[142:38.27]It was a lot of fun.
[142:40.71]I would definitely need a refresher though.
[142:51.93]And I'm talking about like I would just watch a 15 minute video off stream of what happened in the first two chapters.
[142:59.40]So I don't even know why I even had to bring that up.
[143:01.34]The answer is yes.
[143:04.64]Oh, here we go.
[143:14.57]Nice.
[143:15.49]What's in the bag?
[143:16.15]Uh oh.
[143:22.29]Is it a steak?
[143:24.95]It is.
[143:26.05]We're killing a vampire really soon here.
[143:27.95]You okay, Dom?
[143:41.35]Oh, no.
[143:41.71]He woke up and I think he inhaled a hair or something.
[143:49.36]You okay?
[143:50.38]You good?
[143:51.36]Yeah.
[143:53.05]Okay.
[144:00.22]Uh, so... What do I do with this stuff?
[144:07.22]There's not more than one bag up here, right?
[144:11.32]Oh my god!
[144:13.60]Well, well.
[144:15.08]Just in time, as the master said.
[144:17.24]It just needs your corpse, and my work will be finished.
[144:23.33]And then I shall get my reward.
[144:26.10]Prepare to die.
[144:27.50]Oh, but don't worry.
[144:30.04]I shall make sure it's slow and extremely painful!
[144:33.56]Oh my god, he's fucking huge!
[144:34.36]He was supposed to be- What the fuck just happened?
[144:56.43]Why was he that big?
[144:57.51]Oh shit.
[145:03.13]That's like an arm right here.
[145:05.18]Why was he so gigantic?
[145:07.06]That didn't make any sense.
[145:09.44]Was he really close or was I really... I'm so confused of that.
[145:14.70]He was huge.
[145:17.24]Do I just shoot him?
[145:24.16]That guy was 150 feet tall!
[145:29.44]What on Earth was that?
[145:30.74]He was a fucking giant!
[145:44.65]Oh...
[145:53.95]Where was that?
[145:54.79]I don't even know where that was.
[146:00.47]Where?
[146:00.79]It's one of these.
[146:01.71]Shit.
[146:14.02]Oh, come on.
[146:14.70]Where is it?
[146:24.39]Wait, there's more shit here.
[146:26.25]Whoa, this is a grave.
[146:29.09]What?
[146:31.45]What?
[146:33.83]What?
[146:36.73]What?
[146:37.83]Why can't I touch that?
[146:48.79]I've been looking for a shovel the entire video game.
[146:57.16]I guess I can't pick that up.
[146:59.20]There we go.
[146:59.53]It's right here.
[146:59.89]No, it's not.
[147:01.43]I don't know.
[147:03.53]Everything is identical.
[147:04.95]I don't know.
[147:05.45]We're in a cemetery.
[147:06.89]Everything's the same.
[147:09.01]I forget everything.
[147:09.63]I just want to see the huge guy again.
[147:11.99]Alright, if I go straight here, is that correct?
[147:20.64]Please do that what again?
[147:21.70]I can't.
[147:33.27]There it is.
[147:33.69]OK.
[147:37.65]So what is it?
[147:38.49]What happened here?
[147:39.63]I'm so confused.
[147:40.63]OK, save it.
[147:56.13]Well, well, just in time, as the master said.
[148:00.85]It just needs your corpse and my work will be finished.
[148:05.87]And then I shall get my reward.
[148:08.64]Prepare to die.
[148:10.08]Oh, but don't worry.
[148:12.58]I shall make sure it's slow and extremely painful.
[148:24.14]He's fucking massive.
[148:37.42]What an optical illusion though, that was crazy.
[148:39.78]He looked like he was 500 feet tall.
[148:47.58]Do I have to bury him?
[149:02.37]Oh shit.
[149:06.40]Blood.
[149:09.64]That's the first sign of blood.
[149:14.15]Look at the watch.
[149:19.23]Oh, and his wallet.
[149:21.45]Who is this guy?
[149:28.40]Oh my god, please tell me it's all voice acted.
[149:30.52]It is.
[149:31.60]Oh my god.
[149:33.34]I am still shaking from what I've seen last night.
[149:44.26]Alright, we're gonna try that again
[149:51.45]Oh, my God.
[149:52.75]I am still shaking from what I've seen.
[149:55.98]Last night, I stationed myself on the tomb with the stone wolves so that I could observe the cemetery.
[150:02.98]When I looked towards the northwest of the cemetery, I could hardly believe my eyes.
[150:08.01]At 5 a.m., precisely, a silhouette approached the tomb.
[150:12.63]The shadow performed some movement which I couldn't see properly as I was too far away.
[150:19.02]It sounds like either Doofenshmirtz or Gonzo.
[150:50.91]that's so funny Ice King I love this game what a delicious scrumptious treat this is okay so up on that tower where I just was standing at 5 a.m.
[151:10.64]a silhouette approached the tomb okay I was too busy listening to his voice
[151:19.91]Door had shut by the time I got down.
[151:23.25]Tomorrow I shall go and see... Okay, so I gotta go tell... I gotta go... I completed the quest.
[151:28.74]I gotta go talk to the doctor now.
[151:38.82]You gotta turn your clock ahead on Sunday?
[151:41.93]What?
[151:42.21]We're still doing that?
[151:49.75]Does that mean you lose an hour of sleep?
[151:55.15]Okay, so I'm looking... I could see the door.
[152:01.43]It was open, and when he came in, he tried to... I saw the shadow, and the shadow looked at me in the eye, and I felt fear unlike I've ever felt before.
[152:20.08]And now I'm drowning in hell.
[152:30.46]I'm trying to do this voice and also look to see what he was talking about.
[152:34.34]Both hemispheres of my brain working at the same time.
[152:49.36]I think I just have to go back and tell him that, right?
[152:52.66]Because I have this pocket watch.
[152:56.10]Yeah, I've got to bring the watch.
[152:57.88]The doctor's going to use this and be like, oh, let me see that.
[153:00.48]You're getting sleepy.
[153:03.63]Oh, really?
[153:05.13]Wait, hold on a minute.
[153:05.73]You found... That's an upgrade for me.
[153:08.31]That's plus 10% more hypnosis for that watch.
[153:12.27]Can I have it?
[153:35.26]He wants to play WoW so bad.
[153:36.92]Wait, I think you want... I think you want me to play WoW so bad, because you want to watch me play WoW.
[153:48.38]I think it's you, and then when I see that message... Now, you got it in my head now, and you're thinking you're doing a little bit of manipulation.
[153:56.67]What, you're doing some hypnosis on me?
[153:58.67]You think you're going to do that?
[153:59.47]You think you're going to invade my mind?
[154:05.48]nope where's the okay is there anything else I need here because I really don't want to leave and be like actually dude you're supposed to get the shovel oh how can I actually just leave there's no backtracking okay
[154:41.59]You need to eat the body.
[154:44.69]Okay.
[154:45.99]Relax.
[154:47.71]Okay.
[154:49.17]Settle down.
[154:50.76]Okay.
[154:52.06]Chill out.
[154:53.52]Okay.
[155:04.93]The title of your stream is Dracula 2 Opening Cutscene.
[155:11.56]Yeah, that's where it grabbed us.
[155:19.86]I have the ladder, I just... No, I don't.
[155:22.44]Not anymore.
[155:25.74]What am I missing here?
[155:26.38]Could you give us an errand in 2025?
[155:33.01]I don't think I can ever... I don't think I can do errand ever again.
[155:36.19]My voice has permanently changed since I'm almost 40.
[155:41.94]Just gonna have to listen to clips from back in the day.
[155:51.54]Do I actually have to stand up there and look?
[156:07.89]We just get a Metal Gear instead.
[156:10.15]I could try, but that's like one of the most embarrassing voices to do if you can't do it.
[156:16.98]That's like the ultimate Redditor voice.
[156:18.54]Like if you can't, like, I don't know, man.
[156:20.73]That's going to be tricky.
[156:40.61]What's a Redditor voice?
[156:41.55]It's a cool voice that some people think they can do, but they can't.
[156:49.23]But then there are some people that... It's like a Christopher Walken.
[156:51.35]If you do it, you do it.
[156:52.63]If not, then oh boy.
[156:54.41]Here comes the guy with the Christopher Walken again.
[156:56.00]I actually have no idea where I'm going here.
[157:06.86]I've walked in a circle 10 times already.
[157:10.21]That looks... That looks like it was placed in a 3D modeler, so I'm going to try to get up there.
[157:14.41]Go back up the ladder.
[157:27.59]That has a cross on it.
[157:30.44]There's a cross everywhere.
[157:32.90]There's a cross.
[157:33.90]I was thinking, oh, it's an indent, but there's... Whatever.
[157:37.46]I'm just thinking.
[157:38.22]I'm using my other atmosphere.
[157:43.05]It activated for one second, then it just decided to turn itself off.
[157:48.26]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[157:51.92]Did you see that?
[157:56.35]I got an... I did get an indicator.
[158:10.06]Ooh.
[158:15.78]Oh, he said, oh, I, oh, I, oh, oh.
[158:20.40]Right?
[158:20.72]What is it?
[158:21.06]5 a.m.
[158:45.38]Don't look towards the Northwest Cemetery at 3 a.m.
[159:04.38]Hey.
[159:10.22]Am I supposed to be seeing something?
[159:22.69]That's north-northwest.
[159:30.89]Okay, but I know, but I know, I know.
[159:32.78]But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[159:36.78]That is correct.
[159:37.60]That's technically correct on a lot of compasses.
[159:41.36]That's a... I just didn't realize that, okay, we're doing... It's not north-south-east-west.
[159:46.86]They're on here, too.
[159:50.92]It's just like, that's accurate.
[159:53.32]This is accurate.
[159:58.24]There's nothing even here.
[159:59.74]The stories aren't even true.
[160:02.65]There's nothing even here.
[160:03.25]The stories aren't even true, guys.
[160:04.23]I have to wait until 5 a.m.
[160:11.41]I sat up here for six hours.
[160:14.41]Did I even eat?
[160:15.07]I haven't even had food.
[160:20.42]There's nothing here.
[160:44.79]Do I just leave now?
[160:58.17]Was the button in its nose?
[161:08.59]Okay, so I gotta go press the gargoyle's nose.
[161:18.84]Sounds good.
[161:45.14]Why does it not work when I do it?
[162:03.18]I can't touch anything else but his eyes.
[162:07.68]Well, that didn't work.
[162:08.46]Because you don't have any swag.
[162:23.61]It opened automatically for him!
[162:29.06]I have to push it with my hands?
[163:08.76]Okay.
[163:18.44]Well...
[163:21.16]Well, I'm back and I've got, hey doc, you gotta listen to this shit.
[163:27.60]You have no idea what I just saw.
[163:29.16]Can't press a button.
[163:46.99]Okay, we got portrayed in the first game, so I'm imagining that they're going to stay with that theme.
[163:50.82]We're going to get portrayed in this one too.
[163:56.40]I got this thing.
[163:59.04]I have the... You see the tracks, they go this way.
[164:04.21]And... Oh, shit.
[164:07.23]Who remembers that one?
[164:21.33]What is going on?
[164:24.61]Is that not what that thing is for?
[164:26.07]That's a really great meme.
[164:38.84]I need another cylinder.
[164:39.86]Well, that's stupid.
[164:50.37]shoot it I only have one bullet left I'm not shooting anything that is one dirty ass stanky ass stethoscope it took me a second to remember what it was called and I said that too I should have said that faster if I said it faster you would have been like oh cool alright
[165:26.95]you ever use one of these I want to know what a real 40 year old thinks about it uh I would love to you know what I do want I want a typewriter I want a typewriter and I want to write a short story and I'm not I don't even care what it is even if there's a shitload of fucked up typos
[165:54.08]I want it to be the biggest mess of all time.
[165:56.64]I want it to be a piece of shit.
[166:01.91]Oh, hold on, piano.
[166:02.51]Is that Winston Churchill?
[166:22.42]Alright, if I, if I wrote a a 50 page, so at least a 50 to 100 page short story, and it was on a typewriter, and typos and all, it was a mess.
[166:36.83]No editing, no proofreading.
[166:40.37]Would you buy that for $5?
[166:47.54]And it's wicked shittily scanned into a scanner.
[166:57.43]Five hundred- fifty to a hundred pages for five- is that a good deal?
[167:06.05]Is it one hun- wait, one hundred pages is way too long.
[167:08.37]That's huge.
[167:12.45]Wait, wait, how long is a short story?
[167:13.67]Like, five pages?
[167:15.86]Okay, what if I did, like, ten short stories?
[167:17.98]It was an anthology.
[167:20.38]Would you- would- and I charged you, uh, like, twenty bucks.
[167:26.79]It's two to 10 pages.
[167:28.33]I would just pirate it.
[167:29.33]Oh, whatever.
[167:29.71]Can't stop you.
[167:40.12]What would the subject be?
[167:41.30]I don't know.
[167:44.20]I don't know.
[167:45.34]I would sit down there and I would think of something to write about and I would just do it.
[167:49.09]And I would just try to finish it in like a week for each story.
[167:52.69]And it would be wicked.
[167:53.49]It would be horrible typos.
[167:54.63]It would be awful.
[167:55.41]It would be terrible.
[167:56.23]You wouldn't even want it.
[168:05.40]Okay.
[168:05.70]Otto's Big Adventure could be one of them.
[168:07.46]That's true.
[168:09.90]What if I got wicked into it though?
[168:13.16]I don't think I have the item to do this.
[168:15.44]Oh, wait.
[168:16.06]No.
[168:22.40]Oh, wait.
[168:22.98]I do.
[168:23.32]I can move.
[168:24.20]Do I have a cheat sheet on this?
[168:26.05]I don't think so.
[168:39.74]I don't have the info for this, I don't think, yet.
[168:44.78]What about a physical copy?
[168:47.40]I- I think this would be- I would just scan them into my scanner.
[168:51.35]And just digitally, uh, put it out there and have it be, like, just- you just get it.
[168:56.37]It'd be the easiest thing to just, like, fucking steal.
[169:05.06]One of you would buy that and it would be on the subreddit in an hour.
[169:12.82]I'd get it removed.
[169:14.04]I'd get it taken down.
[169:18.70]Holy shit, a ring.
[169:30.45]Yeah, if it was a physical book, it would be a pain in the ass.
[169:32.85]You would have to scan it, and that sucks.
[169:35.00]Dick.
[169:35.58]Nobody wants to do it.
[169:36.38]That sucks ass.
[169:37.82]Who wants to scan a bunch of pages?
[169:40.18]That's going to be a huge pain in the ass.
[169:41.42]You're not going to do it.
[169:45.98]Or it would be a subscription service.
[169:48.56]So I would release one page every month.
[169:52.84]And it would be $5 a month.
[169:55.64]So there's no way you could steal the whole story.
[170:05.59]You get three pages a month.
[170:11.79]I can't seem to click on anything else in this room.
[170:15.62]That's a horrible idea.
[170:18.84]Now that would be terrible.
[170:22.02]What if it was a short story?
[170:30.58]I'm just trying to find ways to make it so if I release a fucking book, it's not going to, you're not going to steal it.
[170:41.71]What is going, what the fuck is going on in here?
[170:48.97]What the fuck?
[170:50.23]Can I go down?
[170:52.75]What does this guy have down here?
[170:56.97]This is freaking me out.
[170:57.95]I don't think I can go down here.
[171:02.48]I can't- Oh!
[171:18.61]Dude, what?
[171:19.27]A thing of sugar?
[171:24.20]Can I have a key for this?
[171:25.60]What is going on here?
[171:48.37]What the fuck?
[171:51.15]Who was that?
[171:52.21]Why is that the only door I can interact with?
[171:55.13]It's that guy's door!
[171:56.25]I can't interact with any of the other... Um... I don't know... Be careful?
[172:11.05]Uh oh.
[172:26.07]That guy just did an acid attack and killed us both.
[172:32.33]What?
[172:32.79]Oh my god, I'm so far away.
[172:45.47]Why would you do an acid attack?
[172:46.97]Alright, I remember this.
[172:51.17]What were the items?
[172:53.10]It was the ring.
[172:53.74]It was the ring.
[172:56.56]It was... What else was in here?
[172:59.64]Oh, this... It was a couple of... The desk, right?
[173:08.26]Stethoscope.
[173:11.02]And then...
[173:14.09]I can't do anything with this.
[173:14.91]I think that's it, right?
[173:18.21]I believe that's it.
[173:24.25]Okay, so I guess that if you go down there, the guy throws acid at you and kills you.
[173:27.99]Can you open the safe with this?
[173:38.61]Oh, this... Whoa!
[173:39.93]That's... Now you're thinking.
[173:46.44]Stethoscope on the safe.
[173:50.68]I don't think I can.
[173:55.16]By the way, this looks like a metal nipple.
[173:58.58]This even looks like skin.
[173:59.54]I don't think I have the info yet.
[174:18.11]Okay, well, what do I do?
[174:19.63]I have a gun, but I don't think I can shoot him.
[174:21.93]I want the sugar.
[174:36.08]Sugar.
[174:41.16]I can't go in the desk.
[174:42.03]I need a key.
[174:43.99]That doesn't open.
[174:52.16]Now what?
[174:55.20]Can I interact with this guy?
[174:56.44]Yeah, I have the thing for the piano, but it didn't seem like I could interact with the piano.
[175:11.90]I tried to.
[175:26.56]Yeah, this is the piano sheet for sure, but I can't really, I can't get over here.
[175:38.83]Paper, use the paper.
[175:39.95]Shit.
[176:02.59]With that circle above the cylinder?
[176:10.89]Oh shit!
[176:12.41]Jonathan has already been gone for several hours and Mina is resting in my office.
[176:18.27]It is a pity that, because of the urgency of the situation, I have not been able to bring Jonathan up to date with all my work.
[176:26.10]I have a feeling that the noose is tightening around us and... But what?
[176:31.97]My God!
[176:33.01]It's Dracula!
[176:34.41]Leave your guard where you found him.
[176:36.71]He's of no use to you now.
[176:39.67]Leave him!
[176:40.13]Is he eating this guy?
[176:50.84]Don't go near her!
[176:52.10]Get away!
[176:53.44]Get him out of my sight!
[176:56.20]Now, my dear, it appears that our destinies have crossed once again.
[177:02.46]Let me just relieve you of that wedding ring, which you won't be needing any longer.
[177:08.21]Now wake up.
[177:10.03]This time, I promise you, we shall never part again.
[177:19.59]What?
[177:19.87]What?
[177:21.93]What the fuck?
[177:24.31]Gun.
[177:24.81]Gun.
[177:27.24]What do I do?
[177:27.72]What do I do?
[177:43.69]It was the recording.
[177:44.55]The thing wasn't spinning anymore.
[177:45.99]That was recording.
[177:46.76]Okay.
[177:50.10]That was kind of crazy.
[177:51.10]Um, wait, nothing here.
[178:13.35]Can I use the phone?
[178:21.63]Fireplace?
[178:22.09]Something in the fireplace?
[178:32.94]EU chatters just woke up to the screaming.
[178:37.52]What time is it in the EU right now?
[178:40.50]Midnight one.
[178:44.19]um alright so I got so what do I do how do I use the piano I have the ring he said give me that ring and now I have it and now I apparently I I have to go save her or I don't know where where are they what about what if I just leave can I just go no
[179:17.21]It's 3 a.m.?
[179:18.19]Oh my god.
[179:20.21]Wait, maybe I can talk to... Will he say something now?
[179:28.31]What about that?
[179:31.76]I was saving it.
[179:49.75]Nothing?
[179:50.03]You don't have anything to say at all?
[179:56.43]This guy is here, but I don't want to go in there.
[179:57.99]Give him the sugar cube?
[180:09.98]I thought I tried to do that.
[180:17.12]There's no way to get it in there.
[180:39.09]So it's got to be something in here.
[180:42.65]Maybe it is the safe.
[180:48.55]I'm going to take another break here in a minute.
[180:51.09]I'm actually going to eat some of my sandwich too.
[180:52.89]I'm kind of hungry.
[180:53.45]This might be like a five minute break.
[181:00.80]But I love this game.
[181:02.84]I'm still here.
[181:03.62]I was going to play some other stuff today.
[181:07.10]But I think we're kind of just locked in.
[181:15.81]Five minutes to take one bite.
[181:18.81]Well, no.
[181:22.45]How fast can you eat?
[181:23.23]I just want a couple of bites.
[181:29.75]It's in the fridge.
[181:30.35]It's not sitting on the counter or anything.
[181:31.85]It's not like sitting out.
[181:33.33]Alright, I'll be right back.
[181:40.77]You're apparently 1 7th through the game.
[181:46.84]So we got a long way to go.
[181:48.90]This one must be longer.
[181:53.52]Alright, I'll be back.
[181:55.14]Give me five-ish minutes.
[181:58.58]At some point here, ads are going to play for a few minutes, but not the whole time.
[182:03.85]See you guys in a minute.
[182:06.14]Plus five.
[186:27.54]Hey, welcome back.
[186:28.70]I just want to let you know that I'm going to eat this whole fucking sandwich.
[186:31.77]I'll be back in another five minutes.
[186:35.03]This thing is too good.
[186:36.10]There's no way I'm not eating this whole thing.
[186:38.00]I'll be back in like another two or three minutes.
[190:10.07]This sandwich is so good.
[190:12.43]It's so awesome.
[190:13.01]Listen to this crunch.
[190:49.74]I gave Otto a treat.
[190:53.38]And I tried to put the mic near his face.
[190:56.22]And I think I broke my mic stand.
[190:59.53]Alright.
[191:01.69]I'm still eating this thing, but give me another two minutes.
[191:47.04]Just want to give you a quick update.
[191:48.91]I just dropped a shitload of it on the ground.
[191:51.03]So I'm not happy.
[191:52.85]Give me another minute.
[192:39.20]Somebody said, bro is live tweeting his sandwich.
[192:45.02]Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[192:46.36]If you go BRB for more than five minutes, everybody just fucking leaves the live stream.
[192:50.78]I got to chime in sometimes, and I dropped a bunch of coleslaw on the floor and a piece of delicious corned beef.
[192:56.31]Sorry, I ate like 95% of it.
[192:58.77]We're fine.
[192:59.27]Alright, I'm almost ready.
[193:04.97]Give me another 60 seconds to two minutes.
[196:40.84]Okay, hello.
[196:42.84]I'm back.
[196:44.46]And I'm back for real this time.
[196:45.50]Somebody said, why don't you just do this on camera?
[196:53.88]I'm like a cat, man.
[196:55.04]I don't want anyone to see me shit, eat, or do anything.
[197:15.06]Alright, are we ready for some more of this?
[197:18.08]Oh, here we go.
[197:18.96]Now that's this is going to.
[197:20.10]We're going to get some interesting voices today.
[197:22.02]Alright, so what was the?
[197:38.31]I had to mute because I just made four or five grandpa sounds.
[197:44.09]You know the ones that... Okay.
[197:55.76]So there we are.
[197:56.58]There's my young voice.
[197:58.32]There's my young speaking voice.
[198:00.40]So what were we up to?
[198:01.32]We were going to go over this way and find something to do with our... Probably our cross, I think.
[198:07.80]I actually don't know what to do.
[198:20.57]I have a stethoscope.
[198:23.40]What do I do with the stethoscope?
[198:33.58]I don't think, do I have this info?
[198:35.18]I really don't.
[198:36.58]Is there four numbers somewhere that I didn't see?
[198:38.20]I want to use the piano.
[198:48.02]I finally recovered from the Monster Rancher.
[198:53.10]Points, you, wait, from like six years ago?
[199:09.21]It is this, oh, come on.
[199:13.60]Alright, I gotta turn, I gotta listen, I gotta hear this.
[199:31.20]Oh, that means that we've got to click there.
[199:35.10]That's the first one.
[199:35.88]First hammer's gone.
[199:51.41]Little bit of resistance on that one.
[199:55.33]Can't seem to get this one.
[199:56.33]Oh, there it is.
[199:58.11]Yippee.
[200:03.58]Already got this one, I think.
[200:08.16]Let's try the top left one now.
[200:12.12]Okay, let's get one click here.
[200:14.18]Two clicks on two.
[200:16.18]One click on three.
[200:18.28]One click on four.
[200:20.10]Five is set.
[200:21.53]Six is set.
[200:23.13]Seven click on seven.
[200:25.27]Eight has the bingo.
[200:34.02]Oh, I did that one already.
[200:37.28]Which one did I not do?
[200:42.04]not do.
[200:46.85]I wasn't paying attention.
[200:48.19]I was doing a terrible... Bottom right, yeah.
[200:54.57]No!
[200:57.45]Look at this.
[200:58.75]I'm just trying to get out of here.
[201:09.94]Good.
[201:10.86]Open it.
[201:12.73]Ooh.
[201:14.40]And it was him all along.
[201:17.95]Okay, we got... Notes on the patient Hopkins.
[201:21.61]Height, 1.65 meters.
[201:23.01]Weight, 55 kilograms.
[201:25.85]Estimated age, between 40 and 45.
[201:29.16]Date of internment, 20th October, 1904.
[201:31.66]The patient Hopkins seems to have been afflicted by a very rare carnivorous pathology, which takes the form of ingesting flies and other insects and other forms of disturbed behavior.
[201:47.04]What is particularly interesting is that after a series of conversations with him, I became deeply convinced that the man's mind was controlled by Dracula.
[201:58.49]And then, though Hopkins seemed so cold and calculating that it was possible to believe that he was feigning his illness, he met Mina and was radically transformed.
[202:09.87]From then on, he has spoken hesitantly and seems far less sure of himself.
[202:15.84]He has become vulnerable.
[202:18.64]If Hopkins has doubts, that could be to our advantage.
[202:23.64]From today onwards, Mina must be present during my sessions with him.
[202:27.89]Got a little ad lib there.
[202:31.57]I like it.
[202:36.76]Okay.
[202:37.10]Is that it?
[202:46.67]Acid, book, plate, tube.
[202:51.93]Got it.
[202:53.83]So can I throw acid at the guy before he throws acid at me?
[202:57.90]Well, there's only one way to find out.
[203:03.54]On the eve of the new century, I found an ancient 15th century book of magic in a bookshop in the Portobello Road, which radically changed my life.
[203:17.13]It tells of vampires and Satanic rites, but for once, it is not a work of fiction.
[203:25.90]The cover is decorated with a ring in old leather in the form of a dragon curled around a stone.
[203:34.54]I managed to translate the little that remains of the book, which tells of the building of a remarkable sanctuary by a monk named Thaddeus.
[203:45.04]Alas, now I am old and sick, and although I am firmly convinced that it exists, I shall never find this sanctuary.
[203:56.63]I have therefore made a summary in this notebook of the information contained in these pages, plucked from time.
[204:05.85]Finish my quest, if you can, and reveal to the world this incomparable archaeological treasure.
[204:15.67]ring on the cover of the magic of the book of magic um so the short story compilation I want to hire somebody to do this and read the whole read each one and take it very very dead seriously not like aha this is so funny no read it like that dead seriously on the eve of the new century I found an ancient
[204:44.41]Oh, there's more.
[204:45.19]I like this.
[204:45.73]I want to hear it again.
[204:47.19]The story, as recounted at the beginning of the book, which is intact, begins in a country which would appear to be present-day Transylvania.
[204:58.84]It tells of the rivalry between Vlad Tepes, also known as Dracula, and his half-brother, Radu, both princes and heirs to the kingdom.
[205:10.86]When their father, Dracule, died, the symbol of power, a ring in the form of a dragon with a precious stone in the center, was handed over to Radu, the younger brother, allegedly on the advice of a magician named Dorco.
[205:26.47]Wild with rage, Dracula pursued Radu and shut him up in his huge underground prison.
[205:34.54]Everything's making me laugh today.
[205:35.62]Luxo banished Dorco.
[205:37.68]But the main thing he did was to separate the stone from the dragon ring, which then fell under Dracula's evil influence.
[205:48.49]According to the book, no one knew what became of the stone.
[205:59.17]The last sanctuary is the one Vlad Tepes, also known as Dracula, built when he took power after the death of his father.
[206:08.42]He entrusted the building of the edifice to the monk Thaddeus, nicknamed the Black Monk because of his Satanic propensities.
[206:17.26]But shortly after the sanctuary was finished, the monk disappeared.
[206:23.29]The author of the book seems to have been an exiled disciple of Thaddeus.
[206:29.36]He recounts that the latter had designed three barriers in the form of initiation rooms with the aim of eliminating all claimants unworthy of entering the last sanctuary.
[206:42.33]Unfortunately, the book has deteriorated too much to be able to read the passages concerning two out of the three rooms.
[206:51.90]However, it appears that the third room is by far the most mysterious and terrifying.
[206:59.44]The book refers on several occasions to strange keys, but no information is given as to their use.
[207:09.58]Okay, we need keys.
[207:10.47]There's three rooms.
[207:13.25]Oh, it's this shit.
[207:14.74]We have his little diary, don't we?
[207:16.90]The devil's nails is the literal translation of the phrase in the book, but it would seem closer to the truth to render it Satan's claws.
[207:27.51]I have made a copy of the drawing in the book.
[207:30.85]It shows Jacob's dream as recounted in the book of Genesis.
[207:35.79]Jacob's ladder represents the link between God and men, but in the sanctuary it appears rather to be a link with Satan.
[207:46.30]The symbols surrounding it are Sanskrit numbers.
[207:49.92]The instructions in the text are clear.
[207:53.16]It is a trap designed to tear to pieces anyone who dares to go there.
[208:00.02]The Hellfire Room.
[208:02.26]Which I prefer to call the Dragon Room, as it shows fire shooting out of the mouths of numerous dragons.
[208:09.93]Here a highly sophisticated system is involved, which leaves little chance for the person manipulating it.
[208:22.63]In the book, I came across garlic and poison.
[208:25.93]Okay, recipe, garlic.
[208:28.93]Oh, yeah, I did this.
[208:30.05]Hey, be careful.
[208:31.60]Yeah, garlic in this sauce, man.
[208:33.08]It'll fucking knock your fucking socks off, dude.
[208:35.12]This is hot as shit.
[208:36.18]Be careful with that fucking stuff, dude.
[208:40.48]Crushed garlic, vampire blood, bats blood.
[208:44.31]Actually, no, don't bring this to the barbecue.
[208:47.13]Bring it to a boil at 30 degrees.
[208:48.93]Pour the solution into a bottle.
[208:51.31]According to Thaddeus' disciple.
[208:53.95]All you need to do is soak the missiles in the mixture to make them into formidable anti-vampire weapons.
[209:02.99]Okay.
[209:04.57]We need vampire blood, bat blood.
[209:08.25]Or maybe that's both.
[209:10.23]Bring it to a boil.
[209:11.03]Easy.
[209:12.81]Okay.
[209:17.07]So what else did I get?
[209:18.31]I got a bunch of other shit too.
[209:29.74]Okay.
[209:31.96]God be praised.
[209:33.32]I am now protected against the vampires.
[209:38.35]Oh, good.
[209:39.18]Okay.
[209:40.52]Oh.
[209:43.02]Can I go down there to that guy with the acid?
[209:49.76]Is acid guy a vampire?
[209:50.97]Oh, we can listen to the new recording.
[210:07.97]This is a new recording.
[210:09.55]Let's go.
[210:12.26]My dear colleague, after your cable concerning the Dragon's Ring, I found a document which used to belong to a scientist friend of mine who died recently.
[210:23.92]It consists of a notebook whose contents have a curious relevance to the things you told me about in your letter.
[210:31.33]It contains information on vampires and initiation rites.
[210:36.00]secret sanctuaries and the ring.
[210:38.60]I am sure that you will find it very interesting.
[210:57.83]Jonathan has already been gone for several hours and Mina is resting in my office.
[211:05.27]It is a pity that, because of the urgency of the situation, I have not been able to bring Jonathan up to date with all my work.
[211:13.10]I have a feeling that the noose is tightening around us and... But what?
[211:19.00]My God!
[211:20.04]It's Dracula!
[211:21.44]Leave your guard where you found him.
[211:24.31]He's of no use to you now.
[211:26.71]Leave him!
[211:37.83]A wedding ring?
[211:38.19]Wedding ring?
[211:38.49]Acid?
[211:39.13]Garlic?
[211:39.39]What did I just do?
[212:08.75]Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.
[212:10.55]I forgot it happened.
[212:13.71]Okay.
[212:13.87]Alright, get me out of this room!
[212:29.30]Ugh.
[212:30.86]Alright, so can I- now I want to go in this room.
[212:33.16]I want to go talk to this guy.
[212:41.18]Because now I know a lot about this guy.
[212:43.26]Can I talk to him?
[213:05.36]I can't stop him from doing this now?
[213:13.08]What?
[213:19.26]Why did I not die?
[213:20.24]Okay...
[213:50.10]I tied him up.
[213:51.44]Did you have to feed him something?
[214:00.96]Oh, God.
[214:02.00]Okay, it was one part garlic, two part blood, one part special secret sauce, two all beef patties, special sauce, onions, lettuce, cheese, on a sesame seed, vodka, and bun.
[214:13.19]I don't have any blood.
[214:35.08]one of these are gonna be named bat blood right that's blood that's blood that's blood that's blood come on I thought he got up it's not the giant red container
[215:01.73]I was gonna say, if I have to shoot this... Can I just give him sugar?
[215:11.41]Shoot.
[215:24.32]Okay, I need... I don't have all the materials.
[215:26.90]I need... Okay, I need bat blood.
[215:33.72]Where do I take... Should I go back to the crypt?
[215:57.89]in here.
[215:59.46]And I can't open this.
[216:01.96]Wait, key, key, key.
[216:02.64]I have a key.
[216:04.58]Oh, come on.
[216:07.30]Am I just going to leave him tied up there?
[216:24.57]Damn it.
[216:25.55]It's not the key to the desk.
[216:32.56]I thought that growling was you.
[216:34.44]It did sound like a microphone coming through my audio setup, weirdly enough.
[216:42.76]Inspect his head?
[216:49.09]Oh my god, you can inspect- wait, can I just shoot him?
[216:53.79]Was I supposed to do that?
[217:07.60]Uh, I hope I was supposed to do that.
[217:17.92]I can inspect something here.
[217:19.30]Hold on.
[217:19.74]Oh.
[217:21.40]Key to the desk, definitely.
[217:22.52]Did I just bash him in the face with the cross?
[217:31.82]Yeah, I did.
[217:32.24]It looked like I snapped his neck.
[217:34.50]That was awful.
[217:39.14]Oh boy.
[217:39.70]Syringe.
[217:40.06]I think I killed him.
[218:09.17]I don't think it's quite ready yet.
[218:15.27]I need bat blood.
[218:16.45]What, with sugar?
[218:19.63]Um, what am I doing?
[218:31.48]Can I suck it out of him?
[218:37.28]I can, okay.
[218:42.32]Good.
[218:48.65]Alright, now this is ready.
[218:53.43]I need a tube to put it in, or should I put it in this?
[218:58.14]Do I have a beaker or something I can... Oh, here we go.
[219:02.56]30 degrees.
[219:02.88]I need to light it.
[219:12.14]How do I start this?
[219:12.76]How do I light it?
[219:22.29]Matches, but I can't... On what?
[219:27.65]I can't, uh... What the hell did I just do that for?
[219:32.43]I have... Wait, what?
[219:37.33]I have sugar in...
[219:43.99]Wait.
[219:56.95]30?
[219:57.47]Too fast, too fast, slow it down.
[220:04.77]Did it work?
[220:33.78]I don't have any garlic.
[220:44.99]Shit, what if I get garlic?
[220:49.49]The one ingredient that I do not have.
[220:57.08]Oh no, where is it?
[221:02.51]I should be carrying around a handful in my pocket at all times.
[221:05.42]Why would I not have it at all times on me?
[221:28.58]Where is there a hunk of garlic?
[221:32.30]I'm never going to find it.
[221:43.01]There's one more slot that I could be anywhere.
[221:46.17]On the table, were they eating it?
[221:53.14]Garlic and hummus snack or something?
[222:05.57]Do I have a key?
[222:07.79]Wait, will that actually work?
[222:13.38]Oh, it will.
[222:16.24]Should I let him out?
[222:18.72]I feel like I shouldn't let this guy out.
[222:22.29]My god, should I go in?
[222:23.39]I probably shouldn't be in here.
[222:52.61]What do I do?
[222:53.01]Should I talk to him?
[222:57.84]Uh... No, I'm not...
[223:33.91]I don't think I have any, I don't think he wants anything.
[223:36.21]I don't know what to do.
[223:51.35]Yeah, the ring maybe, but unless they can put it somewhere else.
[223:56.33]The gun, no, I don't think, I must be missing something.
[224:01.36]Is there one thing I didn't try?
[224:14.30]There's gotta be something in the room.
[224:17.44]This guy's mewing on you right now.
[224:22.97]On the bed, under the bed.
[224:24.15]I think you need to click a book on his face.
[224:47.36]Those are just stickers.
[225:16.41]Okay, I don't know if I can do anything with you right now.
[225:21.87]What about behind the desk?
[225:22.95]I don't think I can go around.
[225:31.54]Alright, if I go back out here...
[225:45.99]Why did I do this to the matches though?
[225:48.31]Fire and sugar?
[225:49.25]What is that?
[225:49.69]Am I going to make caramel?
[225:51.35]Am I going to make candy?
[225:52.16]I'm going to get some fresh air.
[226:15.54]Why would I be able to look at this like this?
[226:18.72]What's the point of me being able to look at these books and not touch them?
[226:32.40]They look like draws.
[226:33.18]Yeah, but I can't open them.
[226:38.42]Just for immersion.
[226:41.64]True.
[226:42.00]Hmm.
[226:47.01]Hmm.
[226:48.59]Hmm.
[226:50.33]Well... Gotta find the right book.
[227:03.88]All these are not interactable.
[227:12.81]This one looks like it should be interactable.
[227:24.51]So, I'm going to say try the matches with the teacup now that I have.
[227:31.57]That's true.
[227:39.52]That's very true.
[227:41.52]Oh my god, that person is a genius.
[227:45.08]What does that do?
[227:52.52]I caught a bug.
[228:12.16]Mmm, delicious.
[228:15.46]This fly is a real treat.
[228:18.50]Hopkins, what happened to Mina and Dr. Seward?
[228:21.68]Tell me.
[228:23.26]So you know my name.
[228:25.06]There's no need to introduce myself then.
[228:27.44]I've been dying to meet you.
[228:29.50]Let's dispense with the formalities.
[228:31.16]I've got to know what happened here.
[228:33.53]You're not in a position to demand anything.
[228:36.95]All you need to know is that the Master considered that the good Dr. Seward had become somewhat bothersome.
[228:43.42]Madame Mina?
[228:44.56]Madame Mina... His head.
[228:47.34]What's in his head?
[228:48.04]Something's starting to get out of his skull.
[228:49.08]The Master wants her.
[228:50.06]He... She's with him.
[228:53.93]Yes, she's with him.
[228:59.02]Wait, why can I choose shoot him with gun?
[229:03.08]Why am I getting a choice here?
[229:06.48]Why am I getting a choice to kill this guy or give him a ring?
[229:19.37]What?
[229:36.73]It's marry or kill.
[229:44.90]I think it's bugged.
[229:45.88]I don't know what this is trying to tell me, but... What's the secret third option?
[230:04.41]Yeah.
[230:06.13]Something's not right here.
[230:07.11]I don't know.
[230:08.65]Something's not going right here.
[230:19.22]Uh oh.
[230:33.75]You're missing an item.
[230:40.95]I need the third item.
[230:46.77]OK, this guy is here.
[230:47.87]I need the garlic.
[230:50.21]Where do I get garlic?
[230:56.58]He didn't give me anything new.
[230:59.00]Just kind of activated him.
[231:07.58]It'd be in the kitchen?
[231:08.34]I don't think I have access to a kitchen.
[231:20.82]Bag in the safe?
[231:22.51]Did I miss an item in the safe?
[231:37.59]No, I got everything.
[231:42.59]The chimney?
[231:54.07]Did I put the green?
[231:54.75]Yeah, I put the... Did I?
[231:56.67]Yeah, I did.
[231:58.01]It was right here.
[231:59.36]It was green bottle.
[232:00.90]Syringe.
[232:03.60]Um...
[232:05.65]And then blood.
[232:06.11]And now I need garlic.
[232:16.81]There's a clove of garlic here?
[232:42.13]It's going to be on the ground somewhere, isn't it?
[232:51.44]Boil the potion.
[232:52.28]It's 35.
[232:52.92]It's 35.
[232:59.70]Was it there?
[233:00.34]Really?
[233:00.72]Really?
[233:01.28]Hold on.
[233:03.48]Wrong book.
[233:11.00]Bring this to the boil at... Bring this to the boil at 30.
[233:14.78]Pour the solution into a bottle.
[233:19.58]A portion... A portion of crushed garlic should be prepared.
[233:23.30]Add a quantity of it... Wait.
[233:26.28]The potion was the crushed garlic.
[233:31.34]Oh my god.
[233:38.58]That green bottle was liquid garlic.
[233:43.06]I thought that was a base.
[233:44.00]I thought that was sodium chloride or fucking nitrogen.
[233:47.72]I don't know.
[233:48.12]I don't know.
[233:49.84]Oh my goodness.
[233:50.58]That's so funny.
[233:51.60]Okay.
[233:56.80]So it's just, it's been waiting here for me for 10 minutes.
[234:14.24]That book is wrong.
[234:15.30]That book is wrong.
[234:16.57]The book is wrong.
[234:17.79]The book is wrong.
[234:18.93]35?
[234:18.95]Alright, then what if we just... Oh.
[234:33.88]Now we got the item.
[234:34.82]Alright, here we go.
[234:35.86]This is it.
[234:42.43]I want that saved forever.
[234:45.05]Alright.
[234:45.79]You now drink this?
[234:59.47]I guess not.
[235:03.37]What did the book say about it?
[235:11.31]Okay.
[235:12.53]Make missiles against vampires.
[235:24.99]No, not in the syringe.
[235:26.19]Damn.
[235:30.19]Just throw it at a vampire?
[235:40.75]are you talking about okay I have a magic ghost gun now so now he wants
[235:57.05]Uh... Hopkins.
[235:58.67]Look.
[235:59.87]I'm armed to fight Dracula.
[236:02.25]Help me to save Mina.
[236:03.65]You've seen her.
[236:04.21]You see how vulnerable she is.
[236:05.87]But to save Mina wouldn't mean betraying the Master.
[236:09.14]I cannot act against the Master.
[236:11.02]But I can't leave Mina in danger either.
[236:13.02]What a terrible dilemma.
[236:15.78]I've already beaten Dracula.
[236:17.72]Trust me.
[236:18.54]And together, we can save Mina.
[236:21.76]It'll take more than words to convince me.
[236:25.06]I know that you possess the dragon's ring.
[236:28.30]If you want me to trust you and help you... What the fuck was that?
[236:32.05]Give it to me.
[236:33.45]That way you can let me be the judge of how sincere you are.
[236:37.31]Did you just give him the gun?
[236:40.41]Take these in exchange.
[236:41.95]Here are my spectacles.
[236:43.65]They will be extremely useful to you because they make common mortal see with the secret vision of the vampires.
[236:49.14]The master is right to be wary of you.
[236:51.34]You're a brave man.
[236:53.06]I shall help me now.
[236:55.93]that he like put his hand on his shoulder and they were like leaning in that was that was fucking weird what was that oh god what's that mean put the 3d glasses on I shoot this guy with the ghost gun
[237:24.41]Oh, the phone is ringing.
[237:25.31]I thought that was just a little magical fairy bells or something.
[237:28.25]I didn't know it was the phone.
[237:29.17]I'm coming.
[237:35.96]I'm coming.
[237:36.26]Hold on.
[237:41.42]Hello?
[237:49.75]What?
[237:50.05]Is it the wrong phone?
[237:56.49]You're nothing more than a rat lost in a labyrinth.
[237:58.79]But I'll have you know that this game no longer amuses me.
[238:01.88]I... Silence!
[238:02.52]In a little while, everything that is yours will be mine.
[238:05.82]Then your life will be worth no more than that of an insect.
[238:09.10]And I shall simply pick you away.
[238:13.32]Dracula called the house to tell me he was going to kick my ass.
[238:20.12]I just wanted to call and tell you that I'm going to kick your ass the next time I see you.
[238:23.78]How dare you?
[238:24.62]How dare you talk to my scientist guy that I locked up in a fucking cell?
[238:29.14]I'm going to beat your ass when I see you next.
[238:37.24]Okay, so cool.
[238:43.41]Now what?
[238:43.99]Now what?
[238:53.29]And the fact that he let it ring so many times... What if I just didn't answer?
[239:04.62]Why did he assume I was gonna pick the phone up?
[239:06.94]Why did he even assume I was still in this building?
[239:09.28]Does he have cameras?
[239:10.16]He said he was gonna squash you like a bug?
[239:15.27]Oh fuck, where's my friend?
[239:22.03]Uh-oh.
[239:23.68]Oh, I'm gonna have to ghost gun that guy.
[239:25.30]I know it.
[239:26.42]Oh, no.
[240:01.45]I'm back down here now.
[240:07.27]Okay, but I'm back down here with the ghost gun.
[240:10.34]And the 3D glasses.
[240:11.40]I think I can take the 3D glasses down here.
[240:15.40]What is all that?
[240:19.74]Are those rats?
[240:25.15]Okay, rats are blocking the way now.
[240:36.50]Okay.
[240:39.74]3D glasses.
[240:42.28]Yep.
[240:47.34]Oh god, it's puke vision.
[240:56.48]This is creepy.
[241:02.06]This is an ugly area.
[241:03.66]I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[241:21.82]Can you feed that guy more bugs?
[241:24.54]That guy is not here anymore.
[241:25.80]I have no idea where he is.
[241:26.74]Okay.
[241:32.46]Uh-oh.
[241:41.09]Oh my god!
[241:47.33]Why won't he die?
[241:50.32]I can't kill him!
[242:19.41]Oh shit, there's an ad break coming up.
[242:20.71]Oh my god, I forgot to take a break.
[242:23.53]I'll be right back.
[242:25.67]I won't leave you with this sound, I promise.
[242:27.19]Oh no, sorry, I snoozed.
[242:29.99]We snoozed it.
[242:30.43]We're good.
[242:40.19]How do I... I don't understand what's going on.
[242:42.28]Is it supposed to be a game with the ghost bullets?
[242:55.71]Okay.
[243:17.08]I... I don't know what... Why... Why could I not kill him?
[243:35.47]The glasses, maybe?
[243:36.45]Alright, I'll try the glasses.
[243:37.45]Do you guys think the glasses on this dude?
[243:50.96]Um, but so then... Uh, we got him.
[244:00.93]He's gone.
[244:01.37]That guy's dead.
[244:05.97]I had to use the glasses first.
[244:08.54]Oh my God, OK.
[244:15.76]That was a dinosaur sound that wasn't even a human.
[244:28.29]It's so dark down here.
[244:32.63]What the hell am I looking at?
[244:41.17]Huh?
[244:51.72]Ooh, okay, two.
[244:55.60]Two, one, three, four.
[244:56.72]What does that mean?
[245:05.67]Two something something, one, three, four.
[245:16.46]I guess I don't get it, though.
[245:17.26]What's the... Okay.
[245:29.17]There's a face down there.
[245:29.99]Look at that.
[245:30.27]There's a face.
[245:30.81]There's the nose.
[245:32.33]There's the mouth.
[245:34.23]Nose.
[245:35.01]Mouth.
[245:36.09]Eyes.
[245:36.27]Do you see it?
[245:39.05]Can you see it?
[245:45.16]Nothing else on the wall.
[245:46.14]Okay, we're good.
[245:48.20]So.
[245:50.26]I don't understand how to use this.
[245:53.02]Oh.
[245:55.10]Two.
[245:58.78]Oh, God.
[245:59.34]What do I have to do with this thing?
[246:10.37]Is there a date or something in the book?
[246:17.49]We'll find out when I come back from break.
[246:23.27]I'm going to get up and stretch again.
[246:24.29]I'm going to refill my drink.
[246:25.63]I want to get some more Sprite.
[246:29.68]What's the... How far am I in the game right now?
[246:37.84]I'm going to guess I'm probably at the halfway point.
[246:47.89]A little bit more than halfway, maybe.
[246:57.18]A third, 40%.
[246:58.08]Okay.
[246:58.38]Okay, cool.
[247:03.79]I'll be back.
[247:05.15]We will continue.
[247:11.07]I'll leave you with the drips.
[247:16.20]And ads will play here in about 20 seconds.
[247:20.07]Give or take.
[247:20.43]Alright.
[251:47.58]And we're back.
[251:49.90]How you doing?
[251:53.98]OK.
[251:55.77]Remove this.
[252:06.81]So what was I doing?
[252:09.46]When did I get this?
[252:10.26]What is this?
[252:10.72]This is a keyblade from Kingdom Hearts.
[252:17.64]One of the unique ones.
[252:19.64]What is this?
[252:30.77]Two something one three four.
[252:37.91]I don't get it.
[252:38.39]Two one three four?
[252:53.12]I don't want to just guess.
[252:57.24]So there's four digits on this thing, and there's, what, six digits here?
[253:01.14]Excuse me, Mr. Jerma, how long do you think you'll be live for?
[253:13.47]Um, probably like another hour, like an hour and a half or so.
[253:25.42]Tail.
[253:26.30]Oh, tails.
[253:27.80]What the heck?
[253:33.90]I don't want to just guess, but do I know the number?
[253:36.58]I don't think I know this.
[253:51.31]Wait a minute.
[253:54.88]I can see now.
[253:56.72]A4267H39.
[253:56.90]Dude, I can't.
[253:57.60]I am not getting all this.
[253:58.74]040... What is that supposed to be?
[254:18.48]This is red herring bullshit.
[254:21.00]That feels like red herring bullshit.
[254:22.68]It does.
[254:23.02]Cause why would you, what game would want you to memorize or remember a like a 30 spot, 36 digit number.
[254:50.45]Okay.
[254:56.69]And what is that supposed to be?
[254:57.89]It's saying, oh, question mark in the middle of what?
[255:00.93]What is that?
[255:01.35]A mirror?
[255:04.24]Probably a cipher.
[255:08.12]Wait, hold on.
[255:08.86]Oh, this is going to hurt my eyes, but I get it.
[255:16.22]a okay what is four four is um I don't get it
[255:42.87]That's the planet symbol of Venus next to the lock.
[255:49.55]The Hellfire Room.
[255:50.73]The main lasso.
[256:09.27]Phone a friend.
[256:28.06]wait oh come on I would have done that one eight oh three three so what one ten eight one nine can I move this up and down or anything I don't think I can move it
[256:59.50]How do I move it?
[257:07.49]Oh, there we go.
[257:08.07]Okay.
[257:08.23]I was trying to pick it up.
[257:12.27]Alright, so then line it up with the Venus symbol, which is... Um... I'm your Venus.
[257:23.10]I'm your fire.
[257:24.30]Your desire.
[257:25.56]It's one of these, right?
[257:52.22]Is it the bottom left one?
[257:58.30]It's the girl symbol.
[258:00.98]We had it on the right one before.
[258:02.30]So why is everybody screaming at me?
[258:04.14]1, 3, 4... 1, 4, 3, 2.
[258:07.40]Okay.
[258:07.52]1, 4, 3, 2. 1...
[258:24.14]Four.
[258:27.32]Three.
[258:27.68]I hate when that happens.
[258:30.67]Two.
[258:32.17]Alright.
[258:32.63]Done.
[258:33.23]Lock it in.
[258:38.42]I'd say 9,000.
[258:52.70]That's already up there.
[258:53.46]1342.
[258:53.48]So wait, hold on.
[258:57.76]Let me look at the book again.
[258:59.16]Wait, what?
[258:59.64]3508.
[259:08.33]So 358.
[259:11.29]Okay, 358.
[259:27.15]Stop it.
[259:37.48]3081?
[259:37.50]You mean the person in chat that I copied was fucking wrong?
[259:45.49]Is that what he's saying?
[259:54.49]Okay.
[259:56.24]I got it.
[259:59.06]Darn it.
[260:00.28]What?
[260:08.53]The numbers on the book, the numbers on the wall.
[260:14.73]Yeah, but... 3081... 35...
[260:25.60]Yeah, 3081, right?
[260:29.38]134, that's what's on the wall.
[260:30.90]3508?
[260:30.92]35... Was the first person right?
[260:33.56]3582.
[260:33.58]Wait, so then the people that I wasn't copying were wrong.
[260:38.73]Is that it?
[261:03.73]I can't even put it in anymore.
[261:04.59]3580?
[261:04.61]3582?
[261:04.63]3583?
[261:04.81]God damn it, I hate that.
[261:31.84]3583.
[261:32.02]Is there a way to lock it in?
[261:34.56]Guys, I'm starting to think that none of you guys know what this is. 3885.
[261:57.44]Were you just saying random numbers?
[261:59.53]There's not two eights.
[262:01.03]I'm sorry.
[262:01.51]That's not correct.
[262:02.79]It's 3585.
[262:02.95]You're doing it wrong.
[262:03.91]It's 8008.
[262:22.36]Oh, come on!
[262:23.42]Oh, these kids!
[262:25.20]These kids think they're so funny!
[262:26.80]They got me!
[262:27.46]They think they're so clever!
[262:29.35]These rotten fucking kids!
[262:31.97]Um... Alright, okay, every single solution that was put in the chat has been wrong.
[262:36.49]3582.
[262:36.51]3582.
[262:37.89]Okay.
[262:50.72]And now I can't stick it in there anymore.
[262:57.22]What is wrong with this game?
[263:02.27]8523.
[263:03.95]Combine the cipher with the cylinder.
[263:08.37]Oh, come on, game.
[263:10.09]Game, what are you doing?
[263:11.41]Oh, come on, man.
[263:16.82]It's not even correcting.
[263:22.66]Huh?
[263:47.35]How come it didn't open the second and third time I pressed it?
[263:56.16]Alright, well, hey, figured that one out.
[263:58.08]Sometimes a puzzle comes along and it's just super tough and you just... Man, you gotta really use your brain power.
[264:07.01]The doors don't open automatically.
[264:08.25]You have to click on them.
[264:11.33]Yeah, but that didn't even make a door... That made a door open sound.
[264:14.55]Did it make a door open sound before and I just didn't hear it?
[264:19.88]Oh, whoa, this is fancy.
[264:25.74]We're going to watch a play?
[264:48.36]Is that just Dracula standing here?
[264:51.93]Or is that a wax figurine of Dracula?
[264:57.08]Um, it's... Why is there a fake Dracula?
[265:04.40]What would the purpose be to have a fake Dracula?
[265:13.20]Alright, do we have any videos or anything?
[265:26.72]Damn it.
[265:30.73]Mina.
[265:37.53]Mina.
[265:49.62]It does look like it's from the movies.
[265:50.88]That's funny.
[266:01.12]What was the point of that?
[266:09.74]We've seen that walking up the staircase footage a hundred times now.
[266:13.96]Why do you even have that recorded?
[266:16.56]He's bragging.
[266:18.20]He gave me a video that I would eventually play days later of him carrying my wife up the stairs.
[266:31.50]Is it like next level just go fuck yourself?
[266:34.18]Is that what that was?
[266:34.94]I didn't do anything for the puzzle.
[266:42.02]It's his student project.
[266:50.83]That's elaborate looking.
[266:56.69]What am I looking at here?
[267:12.66]They fuckin' gassed me?
[267:20.67]I thought that was a fake Dracula!
[267:22.15]That was the real Dracula standing there, just... It looks as if our little troublemaker is coming around.
[267:27.64]The game is over.
[267:29.53]This weapon can no longer save you.
[267:31.77]You're at my mercy.
[267:33.81]What do you want?
[267:35.07]You can see for yourself.
[267:36.53]You are in my castle in Transylvania, and you can expect no one to help you.
[267:41.78]You've lost.
[267:43.55]Now tell me where the ring is, and I shall be merciful.
[267:47.79]Where is Mina?
[267:49.09]Mina is no longer any of your business, but I'm prepared to spare your life if you give me the ring.
[267:56.39]That's a fool's bargain.
[267:58.03]People mean nothing to you.
[268:01.16]I know that the ring can destroy you.
[268:03.44]Without it, you're nothing more than a puppet hanging on its last string.
[268:07.56]I shall never tell you where it is.
[268:09.20]Me?
[268:10.16]A puppet?
[268:12.11]How dare you speak to me like that?
[268:15.15]Your tiny mortal brain hasn't quite grasped the importance of what's going on.
[268:19.11]The world will soon be nothing more than a shadowy garden, people with slaves over which I shall rule, with Mina at my side.
[268:29.20]What a pity you won't live long enough to see my triumph.
[268:33.87]In a few moments, life as you know it will cease to exist.
[268:38.73]You will become one of those beings you've so vainly fought against.
[268:42.80]There could be no more miserable fate than Jonathan Harker's.
[268:51.16]But not yet.
[268:52.98]But not now.
[268:53.97]I could tear you open with my fingernail.
[269:00.25]Oh no.
[269:01.47]Hopkins.
[269:03.61]So it's you who's in charge of the dirty work.
[269:07.31]I might have known.
[269:08.23]Don't talk shit about how I'm pretty much just Bowser in a different universe.
[269:11.09]Don't make your situation any worse than it already is by talking rubbish.
[269:14.63]Think about it.
[269:15.33]If I had betrayed you, the ring would be in Dracula's hands now, rather than in the protection of St.
[269:20.06]George in the cemetery where I've put it.
[269:22.82]Now I have to leave before the master notices my absence.
[269:27.00]And be careful.
[269:28.48]Beyond that door, there is danger everywhere.
[269:37.51]He was actually a friend.
[269:38.79]Oh, we're back here.
[269:40.67]This is from the first game.
[269:41.85]We're actually in the Dracula bedroom again.
[269:45.31]Remember that?
[269:58.24]Can I open this?
[270:02.90]Is the opening cutscene over?
[270:04.04]Almost.
[270:04.34]There's a little bit more left.
[270:18.51]Wait.
[270:20.05]I'll always look under the... What a moron.
[270:26.79]The dumbest thing I think I've ever... And it still has the magical ghost powers.
[270:35.90]You just put it under the bed.
[270:36.96]You don't think you'd put that in a vault somewhere?
[270:39.38]You wouldn't lock that up behind three or four demon dungeon doors or something?
[270:44.40]You're gonna slide it under the bed.
[270:50.45]He did it while he was in the room with me.
[271:03.01]But I am not in Transylvania.
[271:04.87]I'm still at the Styx in London.
[271:06.71]Wait, what?
[271:07.23]The chamber was just a cinema set then.
[271:09.22]Oh my god.
[271:12.10]What?
[271:12.22]Oh my god, save it, save it, save it, save it, save it.
[271:20.68]Oh boy.
[271:23.95]Oh my God.
[271:31.71]Got him.
[271:36.92]What if that was just Dracula?
[271:43.44]Ow!
[271:44.46]That's the doctor.
[271:56.69]alright good to see you I hope you're doing alright you don't look so good but uh I'm sure we'll see you again take it easy oh god carries again
[272:26.82]Uh, should I turn around?
[272:45.53]Gotta get hit with the T-pose at some point, right?
[272:47.69]You gotta hit him with the T-pose.
[272:51.22]What happened?
[272:51.76]Is it the...
[272:57.38]I'm not entirely sure what happened, but I... And why is he in this statue holder?
[273:06.22]I just pulled Excalibur out.
[273:10.86]Can I smash him with Excalibur?
[273:19.91]What is it?
[273:20.33]Robot version of...
[273:24.82]This is just Five Nights at Freddy's.
[273:27.36]I put the... What can you do?
[273:28.90]Can't you freeze, Freddy?
[273:32.76]Okay.
[273:50.67]I think I'm safe.
[273:51.53]I don't think... He doesn't have feet, so he can't get up here.
[274:01.87]Look out for Golden Freddy Dracula.
[274:09.24]Do I drop something on his head?
[274:27.11]Oh, no, I got the anchor and a pipe.
[274:30.05]Alright.
[274:31.51]So then we throw this over.
[274:46.69]Up here?
[274:47.07]I don't know.
[274:54.47]Blunt rotation with the drak.
[274:57.55]I don't know.
[274:57.95]I feel... Actually, that might be kind of chill.
[275:09.75]Oh, I don't even get high.
[275:11.11]I just do it to participate with the group.
[275:15.05]I've been undead for 12,000 years.
[275:17.01]Of course it doesn't affect anything.
[275:18.40]The THC does nothing.
[275:19.76]I just want to belong.
[275:20.82]I just want to hang with you.
[275:23.96]That's kind of what it would be like.
[275:43.49]Throw this over somewhere?
[276:01.38]The developers had to have done the T-pose on purpose, right?
[276:05.79]They definitely were laughing their asses off about that.
[276:08.47]They said someday people are going to get this.
[276:11.27]And hey, 20 years later we did.
[276:13.37]There's gotta be something I can do here.
[276:22.46]I'm just looking for the right pixel.
[276:36.00]I go up.
[276:43.26]Shit.
[276:44.72]Oh, can I throw it to there?
[276:45.72]I don't know.
[277:05.59]There's gotta be one spot where I can throw this.
[277:13.00]You getting closer?
[277:13.66]I don't know.
[277:16.02]Looks like that goes down.
[277:25.21]Oh well, OK.
[277:39.15]Why would I want to bring him up?
[277:42.27]I just helped him.
[277:48.88]Why would I do that?
[277:52.64]Oh God.
[277:56.47]OK, now it's going to be throw the thing.
[278:07.23]No.
[278:09.82]Just put him back down.
[278:10.44]Just drop him back down.
[278:11.30]Why can't I do that?
[278:19.09]I'm confused.
[278:19.67]Why does the theater have modern technology even though they're in the late 1800s?
[278:23.87]Like AC vents and stage lights and robots.
[278:29.67]I didn't even think about that.
[278:30.76]You're right.
[278:31.16]I just... My suspension of disbelief was completely out the window.
[278:35.88]I just assumed, oh yeah, of course.
[278:40.61]Yeah, why is there LEDs in 1810?
[278:43.38]Yeah, don't question it.
[278:49.18]Just do not question it at all.
[278:51.66]Just display it.
[278:52.89]That's all we're going to do.
[278:55.91]Hey, he's Dracula.
[278:56.95]He has magical powers.
[278:57.91]There you go.
[279:01.81]Oh, there it is.
[279:02.19]Really?
[279:07.38]Really?
[279:13.03]I'm just gonna kill myself.
[279:13.97]I don't want to drop this.
[279:15.31]That'll hurt me.
[279:18.41]Was that stupid?
[279:30.24]Did I throw the sword?
[279:43.29]Oh my god, where's the- where is it?
[279:45.42]There's one more thing to, like, smell- Oh!
[279:53.42]God!
[279:57.26]That was fuckin' awful!
[280:06.22]Holy shit!
[280:11.73]I am so thankful that I have the limiter on because that would have been 10 times worse.
[280:24.60]Even with a limiter, it doesn't even matter.
[280:26.80]Sometimes it just is horrible.
[280:29.20]That was that hurt big time.
[280:34.23]I know what that's from.
[280:54.28]He's gonna be in the vent.
[280:55.22]It really is gonna be Five Nights at Freddy's.
[280:58.66]It's actually gonna happen.
[281:04.75]This sword has come in handy so many fucking times.
[281:08.41]Hold on, I don't want to go that way yet.
[281:10.43]Why are these all so loud?
[281:14.37]And I would not recommend taking a blade and pushing it into another spinning blade.
[281:20.35]You are going to decapitate yourself.
[281:23.66]That thing is gonna fly- you're gonna bounce that, ricochet it off the wall, and it's gonna hit you in the fucking throat!
[281:28.06]Sorry to disturb you, but could you please explain why you think a vampire would not be affected by THC?
[281:47.82]And then he said when God himself said that he was affected by it?
[281:50.80]I think that- I'm just making that up, the second part.
[281:55.14]I don't know.
[281:58.02]Would Bigfoot be affected by THC?
[282:02.70]I guess, yeah.
[282:10.07]Bigfoot would take a hit and probably just start sprinting around and just smashing trees and just running around screaming and stuff.
[282:23.23]That's okay.
[282:23.89]I would smoke with Dracula.
[282:24.93]I would not smoke with Bigfoot.
[282:29.69]I feel like Bigfoot would smoke with you and he would just be staring at you kind of angrily.
[282:34.51]And then he would just cave your face in and one punch to the face.
[282:41.24]Dracula would be chill.
[282:42.16]Dracula would just chill and talk about drinking people's blood like wine and he'd make a few jokes.
[282:49.16]Probably show you a bunch of pictures of his grandkids and stuff.
[282:52.24]I'd be fine.
[282:54.97]He wouldn't be able... He could eat edibles.
[282:56.49]He wouldn't be able to smoke.
[282:58.13]Oh.
[283:00.89]Alright.
[283:02.03]Glad we got that sorted.
[283:03.03]Can I not go in here?
[283:20.12]Why can't I go in there?
[283:28.57]There he is.
[283:29.03]Oh my god, there he is.
[283:29.65]We got above him.
[283:31.83]What, do I just shoot him in the head?
[283:32.81]Please tell me I shoot him in the head.
[283:38.14]That would be some golden eye shit right there.
[283:39.76]Come on.
[283:40.52]What do I drop on him?
[283:42.46]What?
[283:42.72]No, I don't think so.
[283:55.78]Oh, that's... Oh, that's perfect.
[283:58.50]That was the perfect way for that to end.
[284:01.81]And now I got his soul.
[284:02.89]There's a tuning fork?
[284:11.91]What is that?
[284:16.32]What a horrible way to go.
[284:19.44]That's got to be top 10 worst ways to ever die.
[284:30.62]Can I wait?
[284:30.94]Can I put... Wait a minute.
[284:33.52]Can I put a good heart in him?
[284:36.94]And then he becomes an ally for the rest of the game?
[284:39.24]And we get the redemption arc for the android version of Dracula?
[284:49.63]This ain't... You shredded him, dude.
[284:59.77]It's going to save you by sacrificing itself.
[285:01.67]Exactly.
[285:02.03]That's what I mean.
[285:02.51]Don't want to miss anything.
[285:06.35]Alright.
[285:06.61]I'm just going to get out of here.
[285:09.95]Well, that was a wonderful sequence.
[285:11.75]I loved every second of that.
[285:12.67]That was great.
[285:17.13]Now, how do I get out of here?
[285:25.76]They should have added some lines.
[285:29.43]That would have been so much better if we got like a... You'll never, never escape the castle.
[285:37.09]And then the head goes, boom.
[285:39.43]Oh, they had an opportunity there.
[285:57.99]Do I not have this item to get out of here?
[286:03.60]Huh.
[286:06.86]What?
[286:13.11]Do they have something else on him?
[286:27.86]Try the book, idiot.
[286:31.77]What do you mean, try the book?
[286:32.73]Oh, yeah, he did have a weird finger machine thing.
[286:47.82]Yeah, okay.
[286:58.27]So when does the real Dracula show up?
[287:24.68]Uh-oh.
[287:26.72]Seward.
[287:29.24]It's too late for me, but there's still hope for Mina.
[287:33.93]Now go and destroy Carfax.
[287:38.01]There is a secret passage behind the organ.
[287:41.05]It opens when you press on one of the keys.
[287:44.31]When you are safe, I shall destroy everything here.
[287:49.23]That way the monster will have nowhere to hide.
[287:52.64]Jonathan, give me your pistol.
[287:57.68]take this key it opens my laboratory at the asylum use the results of my research to save mina sword I I know me too my friend me too so uh take the gun back because he just died he had his moment there and that's great but take the weapon back because he's dead
[288:29.84]I'll fight to my last breath.
[288:32.32]You get out of here.
[288:35.82]And he dies.
[288:36.26]So it's like, alright, take one and leave the gun with him.
[288:39.70]That's the magic ghost gun.
[288:41.10]Why would I do that?
[288:45.50]God.
[288:57.81]Got it.
[289:02.10]He's not dead.
[289:02.64]He just oversold that.
[289:06.04]What was that?
[289:18.51]Alright.
[289:19.79]So I guess he was still alive.
[289:24.89]Oh, you did good.
[289:26.75]Good shot too.
[289:27.77]That's not easy to do.
[289:30.11]First try.
[289:31.01]Damn.
[289:47.38]I hope I actually have to paddle this.
[289:52.06]Seward, my dear friend, my physical suffering is only equaled by the pain in my heart.
[289:58.92]Your death must be the last on a list which is already too long.
[290:03.80]Once I have destroyed Carfax, Dracula will have no choice but to take refuge in his sanctuary at Highgate.
[290:10.97]Then I shall draw the monster from his lair and kill him.
[290:15.17]Your sacrifice will not have been in vain.
[290:18.48]I pray that you will hear my vow, wherever you may be.
[290:23.53]Well, we know that doesn't happen because there's three more games.
[290:26.41]And if Dracula is not in the third one, then we were talking about a Diablo situation.
[290:33.39]His name is just not the title, especially when his face is on the artwork on the thumbnail.
[290:39.63]So we got at least three more games before he dies.
[290:43.14]I think.
[290:53.20]Alright, so I got the key to the laboratory, which should be really, really hog champ.
[291:04.51]Another one of these?
[291:05.21]Oh, okay.
[291:12.45]Wait, how would I know?
[291:13.31]I don't have the thing anymore.
[291:19.66]Can I remove it from the...
[291:27.87]There we go, OK.
[291:31.89]That was this one, right?
[291:40.84]Yeah.
[291:41.34]6228.
[291:41.80]2346.
[291:43.50]I'll be honest, I don't even know what this is.
[291:47.22]I don't know what number it wants me to do here.
[291:48.66]I'm just saying numbers. 623
[291:59.25]There's an 8.
[291:59.51]6, 2, 3, 4.
[292:39.64]six I love the the solution just we care more about the journey than we do about the puzzles don't we I love how instantly the solution was just in the chat instantly and that's fine I don't it's alright this is not
[293:06.41]I know how to do it.
[293:08.09]We solved it already.
[293:09.14]It's fine.
[293:20.57]Let's go.
[293:28.62]Also, I will say that green filter, the longer I don't have that on, the better.
[293:34.68]So I'm okay with just skipping those ones.
[293:36.52]Okay, so we have the key to the lab.
[293:47.75]Is this the lab?
[293:48.37]I don't think so.
[294:04.98]Now the lab, I gotta just, how do I just leave here?
[294:07.16]Oh, I gotta go through the, wait.
[294:15.70]How do I get back there from here?
[294:16.96]Because I have to go back to town.
[294:17.98]Do I just walk out the front door?
[294:20.10]What kind of car do you drive?
[294:33.44]Um, a horse and buggy.
[294:38.80]I'll trot on to the town to get some milk and some bread and I wear my big top hat and I say good day I don't know why I would say good day considering
[295:06.18]I was just trying to think of an interesting way to say hello.
[295:11.32]But I couldn't think of anything else besides the Australian G'day.
[295:16.94]Oh my god, my hand.
[295:21.15]You probably drive a Hyundai.
[295:22.79]Shut the fuck up.
[295:25.33]I'm sorry.
[295:27.15]But I don't even joke, man.
[295:35.60]don't even make shit like don't even say shit like that actually incredibly fucking offensive disgusting how do I get out of here didn't it go to a cutscene the last time I went back to town
[296:10.49]Back down to the room before the sewers.
[296:11.73]I don't know.
[296:43.85]Alright, here we go.
[296:49.83]Thank you.
[296:50.19]Appreciate it.
[296:50.81]I can go in this door now.
[296:54.69]Not that one.
[296:55.51]It's the one that's blocked.
[296:58.22]Is that one locked?
[297:00.26]This is the one.
[297:00.72]Okay.
[297:02.24]It's time for the big reveal.
[297:03.14]No?
[297:08.82]No?
[297:12.29]That's not the key to the lab.
[297:13.57]What?
[297:17.49]No way.
[297:23.83]That's the sewer door.
[297:25.11]Oh.
[297:26.97]Is it in here?
[297:28.51]Oh, it's in where I shot that guy.
[297:30.82]Okay.
[297:32.58]Oh, no, no, no.
[297:33.02]Sorry.
[297:33.28]Not where I shot that guy.
[297:34.14]Excuse me.
[297:35.22]Where I broke that guy's neck.
[297:55.80]My research is at a standstill.
[297:59.02]After having spent months working on my apparatus, I have to face facts.
[298:05.78]I lack one parameter to make my anti-vampire system work.
[298:11.44]Ever since that day in 1897, when Mina was contaminated by the monster, I have worked tirelessly to try to develop my invention.
[298:21.97]but in vain.
[298:22.67]I have still not succeeded in transmitting a signal which could destroy them.
[298:29.63]I thought I would be able to achieve my aim by adding this aerial to the Transformers, yet although this gives better reception, the wave transmission is still defective.
[298:41.87]We're gonna get an even greener screen.
[298:44.07]Okay.
[299:12.57]Put the box in there.
[299:13.49]Then put this thing in there.
[299:17.77]Stick this there.
[299:21.17]And then stick that in here.
[299:26.94]And... No?
[299:32.90]Why not?
[299:45.60]Going to close it.
[299:50.60]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[299:58.06]Hold on.
[299:58.50]This is... Wrong order, maybe?
[300:15.61]Okay, that goes in there.
[300:17.29]Then that, then that, then that.
[300:20.35]Shit.
[300:42.96]There we go, okay.
[300:45.43]Now what?
[300:46.15]Now I have to turn it on to... I just had that weird menu, but...
[301:17.09]shoot it I can't use my menu when I'm here weirdly enough what does the book say about this I am not looking forward to this whenever that is probably a single pixel again I would imagine so
[301:49.32]What's your biggest fear?
[301:50.84]Disappointing the people that I love.
[301:57.78]Next question, please.
[302:14.76]Guys, it's snakes, okay?
[302:17.36]That's not what it is.
[302:20.36]Big, slimy snakes.
[302:31.02]Alright, what is happening?
[302:43.78]Did I assemble it wrong?
[302:50.82]No, I think snakes are cute.
[302:52.14]I think they're great.
[302:54.02]I don't even hate spiders.
[302:55.22]I don't... No, I like snakes.
[302:58.22]Snakes are fine.
[303:00.21]Although they're incredibly unpredictable.
[303:01.97]And could strike at any moment.
[303:09.25]Um... Now I can have... I have access to the menu now.
[303:22.66]It's got to be the tuning fork.
[303:24.49]Why would a tuning fork be in the game?
[303:30.23]No, snakes are great.
[303:32.47]Snakes are great.
[303:33.39]They're awesome.
[303:41.05]I actually don't know what I'm doing wrong here.
[303:46.65]I had access to a menu where I could press the... Maybe I have to... Hold on.
[303:51.63]Is it possible that I have to do that first?
[303:57.43]Okay, I have to do this first.
[303:59.97]What should I set this to?
[304:00.79]Five?
[304:06.82]This has to be set.
[304:07.58]I don't know.
[304:08.38]Where would I have that info?
[304:09.40]Maybe it is in the book.
[304:25.94]On the... It's not this.
[304:47.06]Wait, it's definitely this.
[304:49.09]Ugh.
[304:55.86]A4267H... I think this is it, but... Because that's how many squares, right?
[305:01.22]I think the same corresponds with this, isn't it?
[305:07.51]Yeah, it definitely does.
[305:11.01]So what symbol is correct?
[305:14.19]It's not.
[305:16.71]Hey, it's been five hours.
[305:17.73]When's the grab bag?
[305:19.79]Oh.
[305:22.49]Uh...
[305:26.62]Well, I'm sorry to say.
[305:27.88]Is that right?
[305:36.60]Let's see.
[305:50.81]Not happening.
[305:53.91]Yeah, just this opening cutscene is just crazy.
[305:56.69]It's like Metal Gear Solid.
[305:58.82]It's the longest opening cutscene I've ever seen in my life.
[306:06.46]Do you think it's going to be any longer?
[306:07.88]This cutscene is almost like somebody's playing the game.
[306:13.08]But I mean, maybe that's the point.
[306:16.78]I think the point in Click Adventure is the first part that you watch and then it's an action game.
[306:22.27]That's what I read and that's what I heard about online.
[306:28.42]Yeah, this is like a third person hack and slash game.
[306:30.25]The game is crazy.
[306:30.93]It's like a thousand point combos and... Kind of like Devil May Cry, but you can fight as the vampires too.
[306:38.57]It's really fun.
[306:40.01]But this fucking cutscene is crazy.
[306:44.00]I guess they wanted to do an experiment with like a two game type system or something.
[306:47.02]I don't know.
[306:48.40]And this guy sucks.
[306:49.82]Whoever's playing this is terrible.
[306:53.86]At least get somebody that knows what they're doing.
[306:56.14]If you're going to make a point and click version or something first.
[306:59.84]I mean, I get what the point is, but we're watching this guy take pieces out and put pieces back in.
[307:04.42]I want to fight zombies and vampires and stuff.
[307:08.66]It's really, really dull.
[307:15.97]Wrap it up.
[307:17.45]Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[307:19.25]There, I'll wrap it up for you.
[307:29.75]Alright, I'll be back in three minutes.
[307:32.09]This will be the last break of the night, so.
[307:35.97]See you guys in three minutes.
[311:43.79]Perfect timing.
[311:45.29]I just sat down.
[311:53.26]I am gonna... Alright, so what... No more fucking around.
[311:57.00]What's, uh... What am I doing here?
[311:59.30]How would I know the outcome of this?
[312:04.97]Well, there's a whole other thing under the desk.
[312:10.05]Um...
[312:17.62]Guys, the thing didn't even have power.
[312:23.08]It needed power and it's not even turned on.
[312:42.71]What screws in here?
[312:57.71]I don't even know what that item was.
[313:00.89]I thought that was a painting.
[313:04.12]And it was... Oh, it was a red light.
[313:09.60]What does that do?
[313:14.12]It was a painting.
[313:14.92]It is a picture.
[313:22.20]Oh, okay.
[313:22.95]So it's...
[313:26.63]Is that upside down or is that, hold on.
[313:31.66]I love red.
[313:32.40]I love the color red.
[313:34.68]Red is such an awesome color.
[313:46.88]Okay.
[313:47.14]So it's two to the left and then seven amps and then the number four.
[314:02.01]Okay.
[314:03.78]And seven amps.
[314:07.24]How do I do that?
[314:30.21]I don't know, how do I change the amperage?
[314:37.51]Seven?
[314:41.41]Four?
[314:49.24]Hit it on the side like I do my TV.
[314:56.08]Just whack it, like, come on!
[314:57.26]Come on, you little bastard!
[315:02.98]The tuning fork?
[315:03.79]Yeah, that's... I can't really use the... Can I use the tuning fork down here?
[315:34.94]No, take this out.
[315:39.08]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[315:41.12]Look at... It looks like I can put something in here, but I can't use my menu.
[315:46.05]Wait a minute.
[315:48.21]Come on.
[315:51.09]Really?
[315:53.37]What?
[315:56.56]Put in everything but the white box.
[316:13.57]Who is clicking that?
[316:15.90]No one is clicking that and getting it right.
[316:19.04]What the fuck?
[316:19.74]You have to touch this, the tip of the needle.
[316:24.40]If I was, if I had this game without a guide, I just, I would never would complete it.
[316:31.25]Okay.
[316:31.57]So that was four.
[316:32.65]So now I need to do amps on, where's the amp box down here?
[316:49.30]dude wow you have to that was the corner alright power this thing on let's go that's gg that's uh that's gg I said that's uh that's come on
[317:23.32]Click the antenna.
[317:30.78]Clicking it.
[317:32.86]Clicking it.
[317:34.72]It got reset.
[317:35.40]You need to set it again.
[317:36.18]What the fuck?
[317:39.14]Are you serious?
[317:43.96]Oh, okay.
[317:44.53]I gotta do this very slowly.
[317:48.87]Get this out.
[317:52.21]Slow, slow down.
[317:54.03]Take it all out.
[317:56.57]Very good.
[317:58.86]Now.
[318:00.44]Dink, dink.
[318:02.74]Then.
[318:06.36]Dink, dink.
[318:09.02]Then.
[318:18.98]And where is it?
[318:24.84]Then... Dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink.
[318:28.88]Done.
[318:30.00]Dink.
[318:31.43]Dink.
[318:36.13]Done?
[318:37.55]Dink.
[318:39.83]Turn it on.
[318:41.99]Turn it on.
[318:43.87]I'm taking it with me.
[318:55.74]Okay, so now I have this device.
[318:58.94]I still have to tune it somehow.
[319:06.49]I probably have to charge it up.
[319:21.67]Yeah, it's definitely... You'd probably get struck by lightning on the roof or something.
[319:24.89]I wouldn't imagine you'd have to do that.
[319:28.47]Okay, um... Definitely saving the game.
[319:43.60]Check the... Wait, why...
[319:49.70]Okay, I have to charge this up with... I have to power this with rats?
[319:55.14]Okay, this is an IKEA furniture assembly instructions.
[320:00.83]But... So put the crank on the device.
[320:08.41]Crank.
[320:09.21]Device.
[320:11.91]Okay, I revved it up.
[320:14.70]Now...
[320:17.55]You go to the left side.
[320:20.35]Powered.
[320:27.78]Now.
[320:28.18]Wait.
[320:32.42]Did I do it wrong?
[320:36.59]Oops.
[320:37.23]I meant, okay, hold on.
[320:38.91]Uh, how do I reset it?
[320:39.61]And then I have to, do I have to throw it at a rat?
[320:44.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[320:44.88]It's, hold on.
[320:46.34]These images look so identical.
[320:48.96]It's sound wave facing ghost guy.
[320:52.76]And the other one is sound wave facing away from ghost guy.
[320:59.15]So sound wave facing ghost guy.
[321:07.24]Then... Do I have to reset it?
[321:14.81]Then it needs to be... Then you... What do you do with a rat?
[321:26.57]I need to... Go stick this in a rat?
[321:32.90]and then the rat will power it up to three amps and then once it gets to three amps you turn it and then you activate it and then you kill the rat?
[321:41.39]I don't understand.
[321:44.81]Because this- the amps didn't change.
[321:53.94]Where's there a rat?
[321:54.66]Because the rat's down in the sewer.
[321:57.52]Go do this in front of Dracula.
[322:09.60]Okay, so I'm going to go to where the rats are in the sewer.
[322:20.67]But there's rats where this guy was tied up?
[322:30.30]Yeah, wasn't there... There's a whole... It's overflowing with rats.
[322:35.18]Okay, there's rats right here.
[322:57.91]Alright, rev it up.
[323:01.66]After revving it up, it's sound wave towards ghost.
[323:08.08]Cool.
[323:08.94]Then it's antenna near a rat.
[323:23.78]You need the other thing.
[323:24.68]I left the other thing on the table.
[323:26.56]What I left something on the table.
[323:27.78]Oh fuck, how am I going to get out of here?
[323:34.17]That's the old antenna.
[323:40.58]Need to go back to Carfax.
[323:43.42]Need some cheese.
[323:48.39]I didn't pick up the thing on the table.
[323:50.53]Are you kidding me?
[323:52.45]And I jumped into the sewer and I gotta go all the way back around to go get the antenna.
[323:56.44]I left on the table.
[323:57.36]Oh shit.
[324:17.15]Wait, how do I get out of here?
[324:18.21]Just reload?
[324:42.63]Oh, that's... No, that's a good idea because I do have... Oh, thank goodness.
[324:49.27]Okay.
[324:58.19]I don't think, yeah, I didn't leave anything on the table.
[324:59.86]Yeah, we lied.
[325:12.47]Oh, okay.
[325:23.23]Go back to Carfax Abbey.
[325:24.91]Alright, I'll head back to Carfax.
[325:29.89]I'm probably going to end soon.
[325:33.83]I think we're barely over the halfway point.
[325:36.81]So it's just about another 4 or 5 hours left.
[325:41.87]At least a couple hours.
[325:48.88]Okay, how do I get back to...
[325:53.02]How do I get back there?
[325:56.94]Actually, I don't remember what the... because I... Through the sewer?
[326:05.46]How do I get back there?
[326:15.86]Wasn't I freaking out that I couldn't go in here?
[326:17.26]I have to go all the way through.
[326:24.20]Back in the acid guy room.
[326:25.56]Is that the only way you can get through the server?
[326:32.51]Alright, then I got to go up the great.
[326:41.20]Alright, yep.
[326:41.78]I remember this way.
[326:44.64]Then wait, how do I?
[326:55.31]Shit, I forget.
[326:55.93]Isn't there a ladder I can climb up?
[327:00.39]This is not.
[327:01.15]Where is it?
[327:01.65]Because that's blocked now.
[327:03.83]This way?
[327:04.21]How do I get back there?
[327:15.15]Helpers.
[327:16.97]How do I get back there?
[327:17.95]I need help.
[327:19.91]I'm useless.
[327:32.74]I don't think anybody knows how to get back.
[327:36.28]We all don't know how to get back.
[327:42.72]Shit.
[327:42.98]I think you have to blow up the rats
[327:50.88]I think that's true I think I have to get rid of I think that's how you get rid of the rats is this so okay crank it twist it pop it pull it
[328:24.21]Can I move?
[328:24.79]I can't move these numbers around.
[328:26.45]Is this a one pixel Andy?
[328:31.88]Is that the problem?
[328:38.70]By the way, I just realized right now how truly awful this sound is for you guys.
[328:43.02]It was there was what?
[328:55.48]I think you actually have to go back to Carfax.
[328:58.44]I'm not soft locked, am I?
[328:59.64]Because I can't get out this way.
[329:06.06]The rats are blocking the tunnel.
[329:09.23]Unless is there another way I can go back this way that I didn't see that I just kind of freaked out?
[329:27.56]Oh yeah, I think I can go this way.
[329:32.80]No, this door is blocked.
[329:36.72]I can't open this.
[329:40.46]Shit.
[329:43.80]Use the machine?
[329:44.45]I don't get it.
[329:47.27]I tried to use it.
[329:48.17]It won't turn on.
[329:53.69]Yeah, you crank the machine.
[329:55.39]That turns it on.
[329:58.21]After you crank it, you're supposed to do this.
[330:01.15]And then it doesn't do anything.
[330:03.08]It's kind of stuck.
[330:08.66]See, look.
[330:09.64]Crank it.
[330:11.20]Switch to the left.
[330:13.01]The rats now have the attention of the antenna.
[330:17.49]Then it goes to three, uh, three amps.
[330:21.57]When it goes to three amps, you turn this.
[330:23.93]Then flick the switch and it'll kill all the rats.
[330:28.72]But isn't that inside of this box?
[330:31.76]I think that's inside the device, isn't it?
[330:36.98]Didn't we put that in before?
[330:38.10]No, that was a different piece.
[330:40.45]I switched it.
[330:44.89]Oh.
[330:45.57]Oh, for the tuning fork.
[330:53.70]Back to the outdoor courtyard with the sewer machine.
[330:55.80]This thing here.
[330:56.22]Go to the manhole.
[331:09.55]Can I make it?
[331:16.77]Outside, outside, outside.
[331:17.99]Oh, outside, outside, outside, outside, outside, outside.
[331:21.60]I am just gonna... I'm just gonna go like this.
[331:29.04]Okay.
[331:29.46]We're outside.
[331:30.56]Here we are.
[331:52.07]I did it!
[331:53.61]Here's the manhole.
[331:55.34]I can't open the manhole.
[332:00.91]Walk into the wall?
[332:18.69]Favorite snack.
[332:21.07]That depends.
[332:22.29]I like a lot of stuff.
[332:25.83]Back in the bright room.
[332:28.15]You need to activate the machine in front of the rats and wait for it to turn to three amps.
[332:42.42]I couldn't get it to do that though.
[332:46.95]special info it's funny everyone's like oh dude just talk to josh talk talk to leather jacket they know what they know what's going on I think I think they're also trying to figure this out too like uh I'm trying to just backtrack him yeah guys VRJosh is huge fan of this game he's beaten this game he's got the speed run record on the third game
[333:20.30]Because yeah, the rats are blocking... Unless I'm just crazy.
[333:30.62]Because... Maybe I do just have to sit there in front of the rats.
[333:39.07]It has to be the rats.
[333:40.05]Yeah, there's no other solution, I don't think.
[333:46.45]It's got rats on the...
[333:49.49]Because there's the hole.
[333:51.31]I can't go up that.
[333:52.95]And this is blocked.
[333:54.35]This is not blocked.
[333:55.83]But this takes me back to that bridge.
[333:57.15]And that's not the right way.
[333:58.47]I can't get out of here.
[334:01.21]We got to figure this out.
[334:01.95]This is the rats.
[334:02.71]It's the rats going on right now.
[334:03.76]Because I can't go through here.
[334:04.62]The only other way to go is here.
[334:08.58]And that's up here.
[334:10.24]Alright.
[334:10.80]It's the rats.
[334:14.16]The rats are supposed to be out in the middle of the room here to use the device.
[334:21.50]Maybe it is soft luck.
[334:41.05]OK.
[334:45.71]Nothing.
[335:03.22]You just keep cranking it?
[335:17.83]This looks like it's on.
[335:18.77]This thing is powered on.
[335:22.93]Leave ladder room and go right.
[335:31.50]I can't go up that way.
[335:35.39]I can only go here.
[335:38.57]And then.
[335:42.45]Yeah, it puts the machine out away automatically when I press the button.
[335:46.99]Turn the knob the other way.
[336:02.88]What the hell man?
[336:07.74]OK, is that three?
[336:12.57]Then this one.
[336:19.13]No, no shit.
[336:26.40]How did I get this to be over here?
[336:28.32]You want to know what you need?
[336:38.66]Yeah, I do.
[336:40.90]I do.
[336:41.38]I want to know what I need.
[336:44.96]Rank it up.
[336:46.74]It's two, not three.
[336:47.84]Hey.
[336:49.39]How did I get this to go over here though?
[337:08.89]Just walk on the rats.
[337:13.73]Do it from step one.
[337:14.79]Yeah, let's read it one more time.
[337:17.35]Crank it.
[337:17.77]Flick to the left.
[337:21.56]Put it at two amps.
[337:25.78]And then flick it to the right.
[337:27.62]Put the other one on two amps.
[337:30.34]And that should do it, but... Alright, let's start it over.
[337:40.00]Why does it close it?
[337:43.25]Yes, it's not.
[337:44.17]I can't get this one on the left side to be the knob.
[337:51.87]It's stuck on the right knob.
[337:54.77]You dropped it way back when you were working on the machine.
[337:57.15]Is it really just in?
[337:58.31]I'll check that one more time.
[338:13.34]Turn the switch left.
[338:18.26]Yeah, so like boom.
[338:19.42]OK.
[338:25.39]Why is it doing the right one?
[338:48.77]Yeah, that thing ain't here.
[338:52.18]Take out the tuning fork.
[338:57.06]I can't even set it down.
[338:59.30]The one on the left is the mic.
[339:00.60]The one on the right is the speaker.
[339:06.76]No, you flip the switch left, put the amps to two, then switch to the right.
[339:13.91]I feel like I've tried.
[339:14.59]I've done that, like, okay, to the left.
[339:20.94]But it's doing the one on the right.
[339:25.66]Go to the area with the two levers.
[339:26.77]It's actually bugged and won't do anything.
[339:32.29]Don't put it away.
[339:32.95]Alright, I'm clicking and not touching anything.
[339:35.89]It's closing it.
[339:37.79]I'm not doing that.
[339:39.88]I think I found out how to get back to Carfax.
[339:48.26]When you have the star cursor showing, wave it in front.
[339:54.78]Go to the lobby of this building.
[339:58.06]You guys are awesome.
[339:59.11]Thank you.
[339:59.47]Because I can't really alt tab.
[340:05.75]So I can't.
[340:06.43]I guess I could look.
[340:07.09]I could look at my phone.
[340:09.61]Alright.
[340:11.13]We're in the lobby.
[340:12.46]Here we are.
[340:19.64]Okay.
[340:21.94]Go behind the desk.
[340:26.13]Okay.
[340:35.49]Unlock this door.
[340:39.27]Shit, I'm stuck in here.
[340:51.71]Okay, I... This is the GOG version, if you're wondering.
[340:56.53]This is not the... This is not the Steam version.
[341:00.39]This is the GOG version.
[341:02.59]But... I wish I could figure out how to get it to do this side instead of the right side.
[341:26.52]Go towards the tunnel you took to get... Hold on.
[341:28.46]To get to Highgate, a path blocked up arrives.
[341:32.79]It's here that you'll learn how to use the VLS for the first time.
[341:34.99]Go to the inventory... Just spam it.
[341:37.07]No, actually, don't spam it.
[341:37.81]Don't spam it, because that guy won't be able to read it.
[341:39.55]Learn to use the VLS or go to the inventory and combine the crank with the VLS to power it up.
[341:43.95]Look more closely and click on the left... Alright, somebody else write it one more time.
[341:53.78]You don't move the left meter...
[341:57.02]Wait, what?
[342:00.96]Okay.
[342:05.02]Okay, alright.
[342:07.89]Too many, too many, too many.
[342:10.53]When you look closely and click the... I'm laughing about it.
[342:22.35]Okay, so apparently it should make a star cursor after, look closely, click the left rectangle button on the bottom of the VLS into reception mode.
[342:35.95]You'll now have the star cursor showing, but that doesn't happen.
[342:42.10]Look, it's just the regular cursor.
[342:47.12]I think it might be fucked up.
[342:52.31]Frank.
[342:55.39]Left.
[342:57.11]I don't see it.
[343:02.51]Go do it with the rats?
[343:03.35]I feel like I did that a bunch of times already.
[343:06.50]Alright.
[343:12.36]I'll try this one more time and then we'll pick it up tomorrow.
[343:19.52]I'll do some research.
[343:21.84]I will read the walkthrough just up until this one point.
[343:31.72]Here are the rats.
[343:33.60]Okay.
[343:35.22]So.
[343:36.40]Crank.
[343:39.96]It's on two.
[343:41.02]Left.
[343:44.05]Oh, look.
[343:47.47]Nothing here.
[343:51.24]The rats are in the wrong spot for this part.
[343:53.25]Forget the rats.
[344:03.05]Go to the big sewer chamber room.
[344:04.40]Look at the panel with the switches and insert the key.
[344:08.36]Oops.
[344:13.10]Somebody that wrote the game facts for this.
[344:18.75]20 years ago just got 100 notifications on their phone.
[344:26.72]Because I think half of you have it up right now.
[344:34.26]Oh my God, dude, no way.
[344:40.91]No way.
[344:48.09]I was sitting here pressing buttons and fiddling with the antennas, and you mean to tell me that I had to just do this?
[344:52.87]How would I have ever known to do that?
[344:58.36]God.
[344:58.86]Alright, well, we're good.
[345:00.52]We're good.
[345:01.04]Alright.
[345:02.68]We did it.
[345:03.00]I'm going to call it there.
[345:04.46]It's getting kind of late.
[345:07.32]We did it.
[345:07.72]We beat the rat puzzle.
[345:08.74]Alright, that was fun.
[345:16.35]We will complete this tomorrow.
[345:18.11]We'll start for around the same time.
[345:25.60]I'm not even frustrated.
[345:26.74]I don't care at all.
[345:27.48]This game's great.
[345:28.64]I love this game, but I'm not even mad at all.
[345:30.78]I'm happy.
[345:31.22]Probably got another few hours left.
[345:37.81]So we will do it tomorrow.
[345:42.19]And if I beat it in like two or three hours, then I'll play the trucking game.
[345:46.95]And then maybe some wow.
[345:49.03]Or maybe something, I don't know.
[345:51.59]Gonna go do whatever.
[345:56.25]Thanks for hanging out.
[345:56.81]This was a good game.
[345:58.41]Good series.
[345:59.41]I love this Dracula shit.
[346:00.41]It's awesome.
[346:01.39]Looking forward to beating them all.
[346:08.08]Now here's the real question.
[346:11.26]How am I going to even get to the BRB?
[346:13.16]Oh, I can do this.
[346:14.10]Not BRB, the end screen.
[346:20.86]I could quit like this.
[346:22.20]I saved it, right?
[346:22.78]Yeah.
[346:23.40]Double save it.
[346:24.04]Okay.
[346:30.40]Cool.
[346:32.54]Alright, guys.
[346:33.56]I'll see you later.
[346:34.46]Take care of yourselves.
[346:35.60]Have a good rest of your night.
[346:36.64]Get some sleep.
[346:38.90]If we see you tomorrow, we see you tomorrow.
[346:40.32]If not, then maybe we'll see you another time.
[346:52.91]And for those of you that just woke up, hey, good morning.
[347:00.11]You ever drink sleepy tea?
[347:12.32]Uh, do you count chamomile?
[347:13.66]Because that I would consider that to be sleepy tea.
[347:16.18]Sometimes, yeah.
[347:27.20]Yeah, probably around 2 or 3 o'clock tomorrow.
[347:33.34]I think it's a good place to start because it gets to the nighttime.
[347:38.60]It's in that sweet spot of late afternoon, at least Pacific, late afternoon to evening.
[347:44.66]And if we're playing Dracula, then the atmosphere has got to be there, you know?
[347:59.27]But thanks for watching.
[348:00.07]Thanks for all the support, obviously.
[348:04.59]Like it says on the screen right now.
[348:09.56]And we'll see you tomorrow.
[348:20.20]Take care.
[348:20.64]Call your mother.
[348:21.94]You know the drill.
[348:24.86]And see you soon.
[348:28.24]Bye-bye.
[348:38.34]you
[349:13.20]you
[349:48.08]you
[350:22.96]you
[350:57.86]you
