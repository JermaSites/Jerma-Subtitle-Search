[00:02.24]Well, hello again.
[00:03.44]How are you?
[00:06.28]It's been a minute or two since you last heard my voice.
[00:10.55]I'm sorry.
[00:10.97]I didn't have a choice.
[00:14.89]I was in Vegas.
[00:16.85]Making some deals.
[00:19.25]And I'll tell you the place we found is quite a steal.
[00:24.35]Had a meal.
[00:26.26]And it became real.
[00:30.30]Took a little bit of skill.
[00:33.89]Here comes... Hey, how are you guys?
[00:36.13]That was on the spot by the way.
[00:37.33]I didn't even write that down.
[00:39.53]You might have thought I wrote that down on a piece of two double-lined paper.
[00:42.65]I didn't.
[00:43.77]That's up here.
[00:44.91]In the noggin.
[00:46.51]Hi guys.
[00:50.66]Video gamer arrives.
[00:54.80]Pick or... Wait, what do you mean pick?
[00:58.64]Why am I so late?
[00:59.64]I'm like 40 minutes early.
[01:01.37]What are you talking about?
[01:05.80]But yes, let's briefly in a second here go over the trip and talk about things.
[01:13.74]And then we're going to play Two Point Hospital.
[01:19.40]Which is essentially a theme hospital, but not a better version.
[01:24.67]2.0.
[01:28.45]Yes, I've been gone for about 10 days.
[01:31.51]I think that might have been the longest I've ever not streamed.
[01:35.79]in two years I think right can somebody come up with a longer time period 100 days so it's gonna take I gotta get back into the into the zone here it's gonna take me a couple days am I really going to delete my channel who told you that
[02:04.81]Oh, that's what I did, like, five minutes ago.
[02:07.17]As a text joke.
[02:10.71]You've been off your main channel for a year.
[02:12.44]Alright, well, you talked about my main channel.
[02:14.82]I was actually going to make a Spider-Man video for the main channel.
[02:20.14]It's funny, if I made a Spider-Man main channel video, right, then I would be able to...
[02:28.50]to absolutely, under all circumstances, be able to tell, and even though I'm going to go to a convention, you go to like a Twitch party, you go to like a PAX party, I'd be able to say that I was a Spider-Man channel.
[02:40.87]Hey, what do you do, Jerma?
[02:42.09]I may have heard of you.
[02:44.67]Yeah, well, you know, for the last two years, I've been a Spider-Man only channel.
[02:49.39]That would be, I could say that.
[02:51.89]And why is my CPU running so high right now?
[02:54.50]What is this?
[02:56.04]Hold on.
[02:57.37]This doesn't seem like it should be right.
[03:00.59]Hold on.
[03:03.77]What is the deal here?
[03:09.16]This absolutely should not be running this high.
[03:14.86]Whatever.
[03:15.62]I guess we're just going to have to deal with it.
[03:19.38]But, yes.
[03:21.90]Welcome back me welcome back me me and Etalyx are actually talking about this like I forgot how to stream It's not one of those scenario like, you know, you get on your bike you ride your bike and Oh, I thought I got on a bike right now.
[03:36.31]I'd be able to ride it all the way downtown, right?
[03:39.39]You never forget.
[03:40.65]I haven't streamed for 10 days.
[03:41.91]I forget how to do this What do I how would I do?
[03:47.71]I Have to like play this game, right?
[03:49.23]Oh
[03:53.50]Oh shit, just like minimized.
[03:57.94]Alright, let's make sure this is not gonna, my CPU is really having trouble.
[04:02.88]I did a update.
[04:07.18]I did an update to OBS and I'm really hoping this is not an OBS update issue, otherwise I'm gonna be livid.
[04:15.97]Is Streamlabs up yet?
[04:21.28]Alright, so Two Point Hospital.
[04:22.86]It's kind of like, like we said, uh, Theme Hospital of The Sims.
[04:28.38]And you know how much fun we had?
[04:29.34]There's no mods here, though.
[04:31.02]So we're gonna start, no face cam.
[04:32.16]You want to turn your face cam on?
[04:33.44]Fine.
[04:34.32]I'll do it.
[04:34.66]This is how you guys know that, like, I'm legit.
[04:38.62]I'm here.
[04:40.05]Ready?
[04:42.35]Hold on, I gotta make sure this is, like, I didn't zip this.
[04:44.51]Yes, I am, yes, I am wearing, like, a Twitch hoodie.
[04:48.69]But it's not, it's unbuttoned, it's unzipped.
[04:50.63]See?
[04:52.13]This is real.
[04:55.73]And I'm not, this is the only thing I had.
[04:58.29]I don't even wear this.
[05:04.98]Alright, let's go over this very quickly.
[05:07.84]This is very important, right?
[05:10.26]I don't want to wear this Twitch hoodie in public.
[05:13.93]Do you know why?
[05:15.45]Because the four times I've worn this shirt in public,
[05:18.92]Just zipped it up, didn't think about it, and went to, you know, the grocery store or like the gas station.
[05:23.54]Somebody just sees it.
[05:25.34]And they go, Twitch!
[05:28.23]Like, yeah, Twitch.
[05:29.13]Hold on a minute.
[05:30.01]You Twitch?
[05:30.99]You a Twitch guy?
[05:31.73]And I'm just like, I... You know what?
[05:34.69]Here's my go-to.
[05:36.03]No.
[05:39.17]I just say, I'm like a fan of speedrunners.
[05:41.61]That's my go-to.
[05:44.21]I don't like say anything.
[05:45.69]They see the shirt and then all of a sudden it's like, wait a minute.
[05:49.65]That actually happened at the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru.
[05:53.58]Maybe like three or four weeks ago.
[05:55.54]I pulled up to the drive-thru, forgot I was wearing like the twit- This is- okay, this is the equivalent of if you were a doctor, or if you were like a dentist, and you wore on a fucking shirt, I'm a doctor.
[06:09.34]Yeah, you don't- people are gonna come up and ask you doctor questions, right?
[06:13.70]Oh man, that guy's wearing a shirt that says I'm a doctor.
[06:16.35]Hey doc, hey, can you look at this rash on my back?
[06:21.06]I am a certified dentist.
[06:24.22]Oh, hey dude, my tooth hurts.
[06:25.54]Can you look at this for me?
[06:28.26]But anyways, this girl, she was a nice girl, the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru, looked over, saw the Twitch shirt, pointed and said, oh, Twitch, are you a streamer?
[06:39.46]And I said, no.
[06:42.26]No, no, I'm not a doctor.
[06:44.48]I'm just a big fan.
[06:47.66]So it's like, where did I get this then, right?
[06:49.44]Like, I don't even know if you can buy these.
[06:53.16]Come on.
[06:54.34]I don't want to talk about like, I just wanted to buy coffee.
[06:57.60]You know what I mean?
[06:58.02]I don't want to talk about like, I love Twitch and I love it.
[07:00.90]But if, okay, if one of you guys came up to me and pat me on the back and were like, hey, Jerma, it'd be a different story.
[07:07.70]It'd be like, okay, you, hey, you know me.
[07:09.86]I don't want to be at a Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru and be like, yeah, I'm Jerma.
[07:13.68]Oh, okay.
[07:14.16]Who, what?
[07:14.90]There's two cars behind me.
[07:17.26]You know, all of a sudden you start talking about like what you do on Twitch.
[07:19.68]Two people beeping.
[07:20.94]I got to get the fuck out of the drive-thru.
[07:22.88]But you want to pull over and pull in the spot and go in and be like, yep, I'm a streamer.
[07:27.11]You got any questions?
[07:32.25]But I'd say one of the only, like I said, it's one of the only things.
[07:34.81]It'd be like wearing a shirt that says, like, I'm a construction worker.
[07:38.31]Ask me anything.
[07:39.97]No.
[07:41.85]Anyways, what were we talking about?
[07:42.84]Las Vegas.
[07:43.22]Yeah, that's where I just was.
[07:48.58]me anything just tell them who you are no I don't want I don't care I don't like I don't want to like tell somebody oh hey by the way hey let me tell you something you know you know this website oh well you check me out no just I just want the sandwich and then have a good day have a great day
[08:09.59]No, I don't know.
[08:10.37]It's not that I don't care about fans.
[08:12.51]We just told you.
[08:13.61]We just told you.
[08:14.33]There's more than one purple in here.
[08:16.65]There's a purple thing in here.
[08:18.18]There's a brain in there, and sometimes it's purple on a CAT scan.
[08:20.94]Anyways, if a fan, if one of you guys showed up, or if somebody knew, hey, you have a Twitch shirt on, and you are a Jerma, that's a different story.
[08:30.53]That's like, oh, fucking, let's talk.
[08:33.35]But random acts of, look at your shirt, I want to know who you are, is like, I don't... This is going to take like 20 minutes for us to talk about this.
[08:43.62]Anyways.
[08:45.32]We're talking about Las Vegas.
[08:47.68]Very, very quickly, very shortly, we will talk about this.
[08:52.24]We have a place.
[08:54.10]We've been approved.
[08:55.42]We're ready to go.
[08:57.06]We have a move-in of probably somewhere around October 1st.
[09:01.66]So I'm out of here.
[09:04.54]So, I'll be in this place.
[09:05.48]We're going to do a couple of farewell streams for this place.
[09:09.84]And, yeah.
[09:12.26]We got a good place.
[09:14.62]Internet should be great.
[09:16.78]And let's not count our chickens before they hatch into aliens.
[09:21.42]Because it could happen.
[09:22.94]Anyway, let's go.
[09:26.64]Two Point Hospital.
[09:28.36]Start new game.
[09:29.52]That's what we're going to do.
[09:32.10]Welcome to this...
[09:33.95]At Two Point Hospital, over 52% of our patients believe they leave healthier than when they arrived.
[09:40.10]Our precisely calibrated equipment is operated by compassionate healthcare practitioners, many of whom have even been to medical school to learn HDR.
[09:49.02]If you suffer from turtle head, let us ease your worries and knock it gently out of your body.
[09:57.08]Just infection is no laughing matter.
[09:59.96]Put your trust and oversized shoes in our capable hands.

[10:21.15]I'm teeing off at three.
[10:24.49]That's pretty funny.
[10:26.03]I like how they did like a Joker thing there.
[10:29.03]Guy in the hospital like BOOM!
[10:30.81]You know that that was all ad-lib by the way.
[10:33.23]The Joker, that whole thing was ad-lib.
[10:34.58]That wasn't even in the real movie.
[10:35.88]They added all that in after because he did that.
[10:38.26]Because the thing fucked up on set.
[10:40.14]The explosion was supposed to happen and it fucked up great- one of the number one most anticipated movies of all time.
[10:45.74]This is Hogwarts.
[10:47.46]Uh, here's your first hospital.
[10:48.51]Click on it to get started.
[10:52.07]Oh wait, we gotta- is this like an iPad game?
[10:55.57]Oh, we have to learn the basics.
[10:58.33]Shakespeare wasn't even real?
[10:59.33]Nah, it was like four guys, I know.
[11:01.71]Shakespeare was like three dudes that just decided to say that.
[11:06.08]Okay, let's go.
[11:07.78]Friends who've played this level.
[11:09.04]I don't care about any of these friends.

[11:13.18]Learn the basics of the job by establishing your first hospital.
[11:15.28]Let's go.
[11:18.07]Hugs, boy.
[11:18.59]Begin your career?
[11:19.33]Let's go.
[11:21.51]Welcome to Two Point County.
[11:23.07]Are you ready to start building your first hospital and curing some patients?
[11:26.42]I am.
[11:27.26]Looking around the hospital.
[11:28.12]First things first, you probably want to have a look around.
[11:30.26]To move around the hospital, hold the right mouse button and drag.
[11:34.88]Move the cursor just to the screen.
[11:37.36]Use WASD keys.
[11:38.48]Alright, so there's multiple ways to play StarCraft.
[11:40.70]I know them.
[11:41.10]I know how they work.
[11:42.46]You can also zoom with the mouse wheel and rotate and pitch with the middle mouse button.
[11:48.07]I'm a WASD guy.
[11:49.33]I am.
[11:52.08]This is rotate.
[11:52.98]Okay, cool.
[11:55.60]The first thing the hospital will need is a reception.
[11:58.13]Patients will head here when they arrive at the hospital.
[12:00.09]Let's build a reception desk.
[12:02.33]Click on the items button and select reception.
[12:06.53]$1,000.
[12:07.51]Patients can register here.
[12:08.60]Okay.
[12:10.38]Yeah.
[12:11.12]Rotate.
[12:11.44]I'll hold left mouse button and drag left and right to rotate around.
[12:16.91]Okay.
[12:17.73]Or use Z and X. That's fine.
[12:19.73]Left click to place it, and right click is to cancel.
[12:22.55]Alright, so this needs to go right in the front door.
[12:25.99]I'm not going to waste any time.
[12:27.19]I don't want you walking down here.
[12:29.90]These people are, like, sick.
[12:30.80]Alright?
[12:32.28]That's going to be right at the door.
[12:35.06]By the way, why the fuck don't people do this in real life?
[12:39.69]Have you noticed that?
[12:41.07]Why is the reception desk over here in 95% of every business you've ever gone into?
[12:45.79]Why?
[12:46.29]Just put it here.
[12:48.33]And then line the wall here with seats.
[12:51.01]You want, like, oh, you gotta go upstairs?
[12:52.62]No, just put it in the fucking front of the door, like this.
[12:58.42]Waiting room.
[12:59.42]Yeah, that's fine.
[12:59.92]You can have a waiting room, but the reception desk is always so far away.
[13:03.10]We need an assistant to run the reception.
[13:04.30]Let's hire one now.
[13:06.06]Hire a... Hire a receptionist.
[13:10.65]Leonard panther Kensington Sparrow or Juliette Juliette McCarthy has some credentials here Can I just have a janitor to do it Can the can janitors run the whole hospital can I have a janitor surgeon janitor One star why would I do that?

[14:07.32]$4,000 a day as a receptionist.
[14:09.19]Yeah, can I get this gig?
[14:12.85]Imagine that kind of money.
[14:15.66]General practitioner's office.
[14:16.78]Right before officially opening, we need a GP's office.
[14:20.69]Patients will visit a doctor working as a general practitioner at a diagnosis.
[14:25.64]That's right.
[14:26.16]GP will assess patients, decide if they're ready for treatment or if they require further diagnosis.
[14:33.36]It's been a week.
[14:34.06]It's been like 10 days.
[14:35.07]I got to build up the ability to speak into a microphone again.
[14:37.67]It takes a couple of days.
[14:39.67]You know that, right?
[14:40.79]To build a room, click on the rooms button and pick from the... Oh, I just built everything.
[14:46.80]I like forget how to do anything.
[14:48.58]With the room selected, drag out a floor plan of the appropriate size, then place the required items in the room.
[14:58.92]Okay.
[15:01.83]Click on rooms, GP's office 58.
[15:03.93]I love how GP's office is worth not that much more than hiring a receptionist.
[15:10.25]Alright, let's go up here.
[15:11.03]I don't want to copy them.
[15:15.69]I don't want to plagiarize their game.
[15:17.29]I want it to be my own game.
[15:18.89]So we're going to go over here.
[15:20.79]Start in this corner.
[15:23.43]Drag a floor for a minimum of three by three.
[15:25.09]Place a door.
[15:26.01]So just drag it out.
[15:27.33]GP's office is... That's alright for a GP's office.
[15:30.69]Maybe a little bit to the wall.
[15:33.50]To the wall.
[15:35.02]Yeah, we'll go up to the window.
[15:36.86]To the wall.

[16:21.33]Now we need a doctor to run the GP's office.
[16:23.15]How do I pull this in?
[16:31.44]It's a nice office.
[16:32.44]Alright, hire a doctor.
[16:36.97]Dee Varden, Lauren Bullfrog.
[16:41.27]Well, increase diagnosis skills, 10% more skill.
[16:46.51]Increased GP diagnosis.
[16:47.73]That's just better.
[16:48.43]Increased treatment skills.
[16:51.83]I mean, you're the one.
[16:53.28]You just are.
[16:53.78]Weak bladder.
[16:54.52]Needs the toilet more often than most.
[16:57.32]Clutch.
[16:59.20]In non-hospital situations.
[17:00.44]Okay, higher.
[17:01.98]Just put her in the GP's office.
[17:03.32]There you go.
[17:03.70]Here's your office.
[17:06.28]Good news.
[17:06.62]Our hospital is now open for business.
[17:07.73]Patients are starting to arrive.
[17:08.83]After they register at reception, they'll be sent to the GP for diagnosis.
[17:11.11]I need, like, a place to sit, don't I?
[17:15.33]Zoom in and out.
[17:15.79]Use the mouse wheel to rotate the view.
[17:17.05]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:17.99]Pitch is the middle mouse.
[17:18.95]Middle mouse.
[17:19.37]Let's keep an eye on our first patient in the head for diagnostics.
[17:23.63]With the GP.
[17:24.27]Alright, where's our first patient?
[17:29.86]Pitch the camera.
[17:30.64]He's gonna do it all.
[17:31.36]Diagnose the patient.
[17:33.68]Let's see.
[17:33.96]What's wrong?
[17:37.90]Does this person just have big hands?
[17:43.64]Going to reception.
[17:44.44]What's wrong with this person?
[17:49.39]This is Ricky Hawthorne on Two Point Radio.
[17:52.63]Why am I getting a GTA radio experience?
[17:53.59]This is Ricky Hawthorne bringing talk, music, and news to the whole of Two Point County.
[17:58.56]I don't want to turn this off.
[18:00.14]From the newly opened hospital.
[18:02.22]Just turn up that volume because nothing drowns out the sound of sick people like the voice of a world-class DJ.
[18:10.62]Coming up next, 42 hours of music from the background band.
[18:14.69]Enjoy.
[18:16.27]We've diagnosed our first patient.
[18:17.35]The GP has sent you a message.
[18:18.67]Have a look at the message list in the bottom right.
[18:20.69]Looks like we need to build a pharmacy to treat the patient.
[18:24.07]Build a pharmacy.
[18:24.99]Okay, so pharmacy required.
[18:26.92]Build a pharmacy and hire a nurse.
[18:29.74]Pharmacy.
[18:32.44]Pharmacy should go right here.
[18:33.94]Right next to the exit.
[18:37.52]Everybody wants to go right to the pharmacy.
[18:45.34]Okay, here we go.
[18:46.20]And I need a nurse.
[18:51.28]Hire a nurse.
[18:52.04]Do you want to stop?
[18:52.68]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:53.42]What?
[18:55.62]What else do I need?
[18:57.90]This room's done.
[18:59.02]Oh, right.
[18:59.46]Check.
[19:00.48]Okay, hire a nurse.
[19:02.78]Nurse.
[19:03.04]Uh, we're going with the cheap one now.
[19:07.08]Switch hitter.
[19:07.80]Likes to water plants when idle.
[19:09.14]That's fine.
[19:09.54]Alright, let's get some diagnostics here.
[19:11.36]This person had a...
[19:14.79]This is Tig Kish.
[19:17.25]They have grout.
[19:20.12]Alright, what does this person have?
[19:21.94]Grout.
[19:26.86]The doctor would be so much more fun if you could do this.
[19:29.12]Yeah, it's grout.
[19:34.14]Oh, we got another person.
[19:34.86]We cured?
[19:35.54]What does this one mean over their head?
[19:36.77]I feel like I need another one of these.
[19:39.13]Alright, what's... You got... This guy's coming in.
[19:40.83]$5,000. $5,000.
[19:44.62]Cure the grub.
[19:46.76]Well done, we've cured our first patient, we've earned some money, and the hospital's reputation has improved, which will attract more patients.
[19:51.62]When a doctor or nurse treats a patient, their ability will influence the chance of success.
[19:56.28]Some illnesses are tougher than others.
[19:58.28]Continue diagnosing and tracing patients until... Keep the money coming in so we can expand the hospital.
[20:03.33]Okay.
[20:03.91]More cures, more reputation.
[20:10.68]I get you.
[20:12.24]So what's wrong with you?
[20:12.82]Do you need anything throughout again?
[20:15.05]I should build another one of these.
[20:16.81]No, that's too much money.
[20:19.83]I need a waiting room.
[20:22.75]It's called... Never mind.
[20:24.37]I was going to say something really fucking weird.
[20:27.31]Now that we've got some expensive machinery, we should think about looking after it.
[20:30.94]Machines deteriorate.
[20:32.68]Only repairing from time to time.
[20:33.68]If a machine falls into disrepair, it can be a fire hazard.
[20:36.98]Fires are generally considered bad for business.
[20:40.24]Hire a janitor to maintain machines.
[20:42.92]While you're at it, make sure we've got some fire extinguishers nearby.
[20:45.68]Better safe than sorry.
[20:46.50]Okay.
[20:48.24]Your main objectives will always appear at the top right of the screen.
[20:50.57]Hover over them for more details.
[20:51.75]So hire a janitor.
[20:52.57]Is that a janitor or is that an engineer?
[20:59.79]Jerry Fluster.
[21:02.34]Charming.
[21:02.98]Makes people happier when interacting.
[21:04.76]And walks faster than normal speed.
[21:06.86]Yeah, I think so.
[21:09.10]And then we need two fire extinguishers.
[21:13.33]Extinguisher.
[21:13.89]We'll put one in this room.
[21:15.65]Because, like, it should be here.
[21:17.91]And then one over here.
[21:20.35]The fires are only going to be over here.
[21:23.72]You can request that a janitor repair it immediately for the item options.
[21:27.42]So when it falls below 50%, they do it.
[21:31.27]It's important to keep your staff and patients happy to ensure the hospital runs smoothly.
[21:35.17]Patients will get bored, thirsty, and hungry over time.
[21:39.10]Make sure they have access to entertainment, food, drinks, and a comfy seat when they're between appointments.
[21:43.04]Sounds kind of like Twitch chat.
[21:48.61]I'm bored.
[21:49.07]I'm thirsty.
[21:49.55]I'm hungry.
[21:50.05]Make sure they have a comfortable seat between their streams.
[21:55.85]If they become unhappy, they will leave to go to another stream.
[21:58.74]Don't you understand?
[21:59.66]This is... I gotta make sure you guys are happy.
[22:02.50]Somebody's giving a lot of money.
[22:03.56]Hold on.
[22:09.24]$50 came in from Dojo Brother.
[22:13.32]Thank you, Dojo Brother, for the $50.
[22:14.52]I've been having a rough time the last few weeks, but I can always count on Jerma to cheer me up.
[22:21.79]Thank you so much, Dojo.
[22:23.69]Much love to you.
[22:24.21]Thank you for the $50.
[22:24.91]Hopefully your next couple weeks here turn around.
[22:32.45]But thank you, man.
[22:33.79]It's a lot of money.
[22:34.38]I haven't been around for a while.
[22:39.78]Yeah, it's been like 10 days.
[22:40.72]It has.
[22:40.94]Now let's keep... Hold on.
[22:45.68]One second.
[22:47.10]Keeping people happy.
[22:49.66]That's all I care... I'm trying.
[22:52.06]Just watch.
[22:53.26]I'll tell like a funny story.
[22:55.52]We were in Vegas.
[22:56.80]You have no idea.
[22:58.06]It was actually pretty boring.
[22:59.44]We just kind of looked at houses and decided on the house that we wanted to live in.
[23:05.42]That's it.
[23:08.94]Nothing else happened of interest.
[23:11.04]Alright.
[23:11.52]Keep people happy.
[23:13.23]Comfy seat.
[23:14.41]If they become unhappy, they're going to leave.
[23:16.57]Place them out to make a nice waiting room for patients.
[23:21.74]How about a snack machine?
[23:23.12]What do you guys want?
[23:23.92]This is you.
[23:24.54]I'm caring about you guys here.
[23:25.60]A bench?
[23:27.12]Well, let's have a bench right in front of the... We have two benches here.
[23:30.50]Oh, this would be so awkward.
[23:42.22]Imagine being this lady.
[23:43.26]These people just constantly sitting around you.
[23:46.10]That's fine.
[23:46.50]We don't need more than that.
[23:47.24]Alright, we need a drink machine.
[23:52.24]So let's put a drink machine right here.
[23:54.48]It fits perfectly.
[23:56.08]Snack machine.
[23:58.70]Can I put it in his office?
[24:00.86]I can't put a snack machine in his office.
[24:05.15]That's bullshit.
[24:07.95]Okay, get rid of the fire extinguisher.
[24:13.64]Snacks are more important.
[24:17.06]Okay.
[24:19.03]Place one leaflet stand.
[24:22.24]Just take it as you come in.
[24:24.44]Right?
[24:25.50]Nobody touches these anyways.
[24:26.72]I don't even know why people want these in their office.
[24:31.75]Seriously.
[24:34.99]What a waste of paper.
[24:37.75]You can pick it up like I just did by holding the left mouse button.
[24:41.59]And that's good to go.
[24:42.61]So now, how many patients have we served?
[24:45.39]Staff energy and breaks.
[24:46.31]Staff get tired as they work and eventually go on a break.
[24:48.96]Staff room will help relax and return to work energized.
[24:51.60]Drinks and snacks help keep them happy too.
[24:55.50]If you make a room larger and fill it with interesting items, it will be considered more prestigious.
[24:59.54]People using a high prestige room will become happier.
[25:03.88]Okay, so the bigger the better.
[25:08.74]You got it.
[25:18.69]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:22.32]Add to room.
[25:41.17]This is like a- This is the bowling alley all over again.
[25:45.11]Bigger.
[25:46.37]No, that's big- That's big enough.
[25:59.04]It's the entire hospital.
[26:01.84]I'm gonna run out of room.
[26:06.38]This tutorial level is pretty much done already, right?
[26:09.17]Okay, door.
[26:14.71]Window.
[26:18.01]He's already... Staff prestige room, level 3.
[26:20.19]Sofa.
[26:24.90]You gotta walk like a quarter mile to go sit in this seat.
[26:46.36]How much does it take to get to prestige level 4?
[26:49.96]Okay, that's as high as I can go, I think.
[26:53.94]Alright, that's good.
[27:19.99]Staff will head to a staff room when they're on a break.
[27:22.03]Fill the room with interesting items to help them become fully refreshed.
[27:25.27]No, you can place a member of staff in a staff room to make them take a break.
[27:29.35]Okay.
[27:31.89]So you can just pick them up and drop them in.
[27:33.63]To pick a member of staff, hover over them and hold the left mouse button.
[27:35.72]So you can force somebody to go on a break.
[27:39.16]Guys, this is the tutorial level.
[27:40.26]It doesn't matter.
[27:41.85]New illness.
[27:42.57]Clamp discovered.
[27:43.77]Our doctors have discovered a new illness.
[27:45.19]Clamp.
[27:46.39]Once this grips a patient, it doesn't let go.
[27:48.01]It afflicts many living statues and self-taking chumps.
[27:52.49]We'll send the patients for treatment to our pharmacy.
[27:56.52]Okay, we already did this.
[27:57.36]Hospital reputation.
[27:58.42]Yeah, we already saw that.
[27:59.30]Alright, so who do we got here?
[28:01.26]Somebody waiting?
[28:03.34]Charlie work.
[28:06.08]Are they giving an Always Sunny reference right now?
[28:09.28]Drinks and snacks are great for keeping people happy, but they can lead to littering if there are no bins nearby.
[28:15.03]While we're at it, staff and patients will get pretty grumpy if they don't have access to any toilets.
[28:19.65]You might want to invest in some quality porcelain.
[28:22.37]Janitors will help maintain all of these, restocking vending machines, whipping up litter, emptying bins, and unlocking toilets.
[28:27.99]Unblocking toilets.
[28:29.83]Okay.
[28:32.47]Toilets have been unlocked.
[28:34.23]Wait, I want to see.
[28:34.81]Is this... He's fixing this.
[28:36.81]How long does it take to fix?
[28:40.76]They're going the Team Fortress route.
[28:42.70]Just smash it with a wrench a few times.
[28:44.78]What's this guy waiting for?
[28:46.54]He has clamp.
[28:47.32]I'm assuming we're going to get multiple clamps here.
[28:52.67]Now he's got grout.
[28:55.69]Alright, let's build a toilet.
[28:56.81]Oh, fuck, I need a bathroom.
[29:06.86]In the news today, conditions at the Rotting Hill Hospital are getting worse every day.
[29:13.28]Apparently, patients are just as likely to die from sinkholes and crumbling ceilings as any diseases.
[29:20.38]At least that'll keep the queues down.
[29:22.12]A bathroom visit?
[29:26.12]You're telling me this might be too small?
[29:28.72]It's not.
[29:34.38]Every private bathroom in a business is like this.
[29:37.24]God damn it.
[29:37.82]It's still not big enough.
[29:49.98]Okay, pick it up.
[29:51.94]There's the door.
[29:52.60]Can they walk by the sink?
[29:54.40]They can, right?
[29:56.48]Hand dryer.
[29:56.74]Hand dryer.
[29:59.92]And then a... What else do you need in here?
[30:02.46]A trash bin?
[30:03.36]Why can I not... The build room is not ready yet.
[30:05.22]Why?
[30:08.20]How many do I need?
[30:16.80]Toilet... What's wrong with the toilet?
[30:17.94]Oh, it needs a window?
[30:24.84]Why would you want a window in a bathroom?
[30:31.29]There's no window.
[30:31.95]Okay, there's a window.
[30:36.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[30:37.17]Hold on.
[30:43.63]I should just put a window.
[30:45.57]There.
[30:46.77]No.
[30:46.95]Alright.
[30:47.63]It's not the window.
[30:48.47]The room's just not big enough.
[30:51.33]Minimum room size is three by two.
[30:56.14]Like that.
[30:58.02]Alright.
[31:00.37]Do you want to sell one invalid item?
[31:01.99]No, no, no.
[31:02.45]What are you talking about?
[31:09.29]Okay.
[31:10.01]So what's the invalid item?
[31:12.20]Sell one invalid item.
[31:14.02]Sure.
[31:14.36]Well, it was the window, I think.
[31:17.74]That's fine.
[31:18.18]Alright.
[31:18.44]Bathroom now exists.
[31:19.60]What's going on here?
[31:21.16]Nobody at work.
[31:21.70]Nobody's working.
[31:22.36]Hey!
[31:28.24]The bench outside the room.
[31:29.52]Well, whatever.
[31:32.86]We're hearing reports of some new illnesses in town.
[31:35.39]These might be harder to diagnose.
[31:36.61]We may need to build a new diagnostics room if a JP isn't certain.
[31:41.07]They will send a patient for further diagnostics.
[31:45.16]Why did I fucking do this?
[31:47.08]Get back to work.
[31:48.94]No, you're not on break.
[31:50.14]Why are you still on break?
[31:54.13]As you expand the hospital with more rooms and staff, the hospital level increases.
[31:56.91]A larger hospital attracts more patients.
[31:59.84]As the hospital gets busier, queues may start to get long.
[32:02.52]More GP offices, more staff.
[32:06.16]Look out for queue warnings above rooms.
[32:07.78]You can also hover over a room to highlight people queuing for that room.
[32:16.40]Where the hell is everybody?
[32:20.75]Are they getting lost in the maze?
[32:22.21]Where are all my workers?
[32:28.43]No one's even working.
[32:29.27]Okay.
[32:30.71]Spend the hospital with more rooms and stuff.
[32:32.27]I need a... Bathroom's there.
[32:36.59]Alright, that's the janitor.
[32:39.01]No, that's not the janitor.
[32:40.37]That's a nurse.
[32:43.09]Cure two patients.
[32:44.89]Let's see.
[32:45.51]Rooms.
[32:46.89]General diagnostics.
[32:50.24]I'm going to have to cut into the staff room here.
[32:58.14]God damn it.
[33:04.65]How do I edit?
[33:06.37]Okay, here we go.
[33:21.63]I want to get rid of this.
[33:24.49]Okay.
[33:25.45]What is blocking?
[33:26.39]God damn it.
[33:32.18]What?
[33:32.58]How do I sell this shit?
[33:34.86]That DJ comes in and screams in your ear, doesn't he?
[33:38.72]I don't understand what's wrong with this room.
[33:51.40]No, my mistake.
[33:52.48]Anyway, keep those fingers green.
[33:56.41]For we've exhausted all forms of diagnosis on a patient.
[33:58.33]Yeah, I know, I'm working on it.
[34:00.43]Okay, that's fine.
[34:01.65]What the hell?
[34:06.37]What did?
[34:06.71]Why?
[34:06.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[34:07.48]Did I just sell the toilet?
[34:08.48]Why did that get sold?
[34:10.00]Why did the sink get sold?
[34:11.16]Give me the sink.
[34:18.10]Give me the fucking bathroom sink.
[34:25.54]that's fine let's go uh general diagnostics let's put it right here alright we need a easy scan machine this is too big remind me for the next thing I don't need this much space this way too much I'm gonna ruin I'm gonna run out of space I need another doctor I need like two doctors actually higher doctors
[34:57.45]I don't know.
[34:57.99]I just... I'm used to dragging and clicking a huge amount of room.
[35:03.21]There's a new particular analyst in town.
[35:04.43]Lightheadedness.
[35:04.95]We're going to need some new expensive new equipment.
[35:09.73]Unlock the treatment room.
[35:10.57]We may need something in the GP's office.
[35:15.18]Okay, I want this guy's beard.
[35:16.46]And he's doing like the little kid thing.
[35:17.88]The you did a... you succeeded thing.
[35:23.14]Are there two nurses in here?
[35:24.88]No.
[35:29.42]So we need... I need another GP.
[35:30.60]Where'd he go?
[35:36.35]I just put him in here.
[35:36.93]What is he doing?
[35:38.17]Looking for work.
[35:39.09]I just had you in the room that needed work.
[35:43.21]Get in there.
[35:44.36]He's gonna get lost in this fucking stupid hallway.
[35:48.30]I'm gonna have to put like a wet symbol here.
[35:50.24]You know, don't cross.
[35:51.06]It's wet.
[35:55.32]Alright, well I guess no one needs...
[35:58.82]This is the doctor in here.
[35:59.74]Alright, so now we need, um... Does a nurse operate this?
[36:09.94]Working in general di- So this is a nurse's office.
[36:14.09]God damn it.
[36:14.83]Nurse, please go to the pharmacy.
[36:16.83]Okay, well, that's fine.
[36:17.83]Uh, doctors have diagnosed a patient with bed face.
[36:22.93]But it requires a ward for treatment.
[36:26.35]Bed face?
[36:31.76]How is that bed face?
[36:32.84]Alright, let's, uh... I need a ward.
[36:39.80]God damn it, man.
[36:41.44]This joke has run its course.
[36:42.78]Everything has to be sold in here.
[36:44.38]How do I sell items?
[36:53.66]Finance.
[36:54.00]In the finance tab, you can access the business overview for a deep...
[36:58.64]Dive in all aspects.
[36:59.44]You can also adjust the prices.
[37:01.22]You charge in the hospital.
[37:02.76]Okay.
[37:03.94]How do I get rid of this item?
[37:09.43]How do I delete that?
[37:12.77]There it is.
[37:13.21]Okay.
[37:14.01]Sell.
[37:14.27]There we go.
[37:20.73]There we go.
[37:27.46]Yes, we are just going to encroach on everything.
[37:33.70]For future reference.
[37:39.34]It's done?
[37:40.78]Is the radio done?
[37:41.52]Okay.
[37:46.45]This also can come down.
[37:51.47]Let me get in here.
[37:52.61]It's not the right room.
[37:53.45]Alright, that's fine.
[37:55.51]Alright, I need a ward.
[37:59.88]The radio is the worst thing.
[38:02.24]I need to know the... I did this all so... This is the first level.
[38:04.94]It's okay.
[38:05.38]This is just learning how to play the game.
[38:06.86]I get it now.
[38:07.92]Whatever.
[38:09.88]It's a nurse that's in here.
[38:10.73]I need to know the GP's office.
[38:13.67]Because... That guy's walking around doing nothing.
[38:17.29]GP's office can be very small.
[38:19.59]Door.
[38:21.51]Desk.
[38:22.47]Filing cabinet.
[38:25.75]Good.
[38:26.25]There it is.
[38:26.85]Now he can work there.
[38:29.11]We need a ward.
[38:31.25]Rooms, ward.
[38:35.33]How is anybody gonna get over?
[38:36.43]Alright, that's fine.
[38:39.66]Can I go this way?
[38:44.54]Fuck.
[38:46.64]This stupid staff room.
[38:48.63]What was I thinking?
[38:53.31]How big does it have to be?
[38:54.67]Four by three.
[39:11.12]Can I pick up the whole room?
[39:15.83]Like, I want to just pick the whole room up.
[39:23.83]Don't get lost over here, dude.
[39:25.45]Don't come over here.
[39:26.19]You're not going to like it.
[39:27.32]Okay.
[39:40.49]All this is because I made the staff room as big as I possibly could.
[39:43.59]Why did I not just wait, like, 20 minutes to make that stupid fucking joke?
[39:56.94]This needs to be... Okay, that's fine.
[40:04.44]Alright, that needs to be placed.
[40:08.81]Place it here.
[40:16.21]There's the ward.
[40:16.87]There's the door.
[40:20.93]Alright.
[40:23.75]This also doesn't need to be this big.
[40:26.41]Making all these rooms five times larger than they need to be.
[40:33.65]Wards can be used for diagnosis and also treat a range of illnesses.
[40:36.65]A nurse is required to admit each patient.
[40:38.48]Look after them and discharge them when they're ready to leave.
[40:41.42]Add multiple beds to a ward to deal with more than one patient.
[40:48.53]I just need two nurses.
[40:54.44]Okay, so let's, uh, hospital star rating.
[41:03.50]The Two Point Health Ministry is keen to recognize the achievements of every hospital in the county.
[41:08.89]If we can build a hospital that satisfies the needs of the local area, the hospital will be awarded an official star rating.
[41:15.03]This would be great for our organization.
[41:16.47]Not only does each star come with associated rewards, but it will also... Hell, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:21.49]You can have more hospitals.
[41:22.51]Continue to expand the hospital.
[41:23.39]It will require a one-star rating.
[41:27.27]You get Kudosh.
[41:29.45]You can use this to unlock items to use at any of our hospitals.
[41:31.96]Check the items list to see what we can afford.
[41:33.92]Oh, okay.
[41:42.66]I'm not turning the DJ back on.
[41:45.68]No, he's way louder than everybody else.
[41:49.10]There already is a DJ.
[41:50.26]There's that nurse that comes on and says, like, doctor required and standard diagnosis.
[41:53.98]I don't need a second DJ.
[41:57.25]View the world with state-of-the-art hospital administrator goggles designed by Bungle Technologies.
[42:01.49]These high-tech spectacles use advanced optical sensors and a patented privacy invasion algorithm to analyze the state of people and items within the field of view.
[42:10.53]Through careful calibration, scientists have been able to harness the power of this extraordinary invention.
[42:14.94]detect such things as how much someone needs the toilet or how much they want a packet of crisps inspiring stuff use these visualization modes to analyze the state of the hospital environment use the moods and the needs of patients and staff and the maintenance levels of high oh that's actually kind of cool staff happiness patient happiness all greens baby health everyone's healthy attractiveness
[42:45.92]This is a real handsome room, apparently.
[42:50.48]Temperature?
[42:50.92]Oh, I'm gonna have to put AC in and stuff.
[42:54.15]Hunger.
[42:54.49]Okay.
[42:56.95]Thirst.
[42:57.73]I got machines.
[42:59.47]Staff energy.
[43:01.63]Hygiene.
[43:02.23]Everything's good.
[43:03.17]It's clean everywhere.
[43:04.11]Did somebody just come out of the toilet?
[43:08.01]Somebody just came out of the toilet.
[43:10.44]Who's this guy?
[43:11.40]Oh, that's the generator.
[43:12.04]Never mind.
[43:13.48]What is he doing?
[43:17.01]Hey, he didn't wash his hands!
[43:18.41]Wash your hands!
[43:21.15]Go wash your hands.
[43:22.51]Pick up, fire, take a break, pay re- You wash your fucking hands.
[43:32.09]God damn it.
[43:32.79]He's like shaking people's hands and stuff.
[43:37.79]Boredom?
[43:41.44]What do you mean fire?
[43:44.58]No, that's okay.
[43:45.42]That's not a fireball offense.
[43:47.93]That's an awkward... Hey, can you come into my office for a second here, Gerald?
[43:52.21]Close the door behind you.
[43:53.73]It's one of those.
[43:54.25]You're not going to get fired for that.
[43:55.83]Unless you're in a food business, which... Don't do that.
[43:59.79]What's wrong with you?
[44:00.29]These people have light bulbs for heads.
[44:05.24]How do we deal with... Okay.
[44:06.74]Back, back, back, back, back, back to what we were doing.
[44:09.58]We've got... Hire two nurses.
[44:16.48]Hogwash.
[44:18.02]Yeah, you're fine.
[44:21.50]Cure three patients with lightheadedness.
[44:25.52]Which is this.
[44:29.47]Awards and yearly... I got awards and yearly review.
[44:32.17]Two-point county healthcare award ceremony.
[44:35.67]Did I win?
[44:43.51]Yep.
[44:44.81]Oh, that's the King's seal.
[44:46.81]That's the King's words.
[44:49.26]Open.
[44:52.60]The Burke Award for Doctor of the Year is presented to Dr. Lauren Bullfrog at Two Point Foundation.
[44:57.76]Doctor of the Year.
[45:05.28]Nurse of the Year.
[45:07.08]Oscar Lentils.
[45:08.93]Alright.
[45:09.57]By the way, this is the only hospital that exists in the entire county.
[45:12.81]Because we're getting every single award.
[45:17.45]Janitor of the Year is presented to Holistics.
[45:21.23]Oh.
[45:21.83]Well, that's what happens when we... Our janitor does not wash his hands after putting his hands in toilets.
[45:28.04]Alright.
[45:30.38]Assistant of the Year is for the Orb Foundation.
[45:32.34]Nope.
[45:33.90]Our assistant took too many breaks.
[45:40.53]Employer of the Year, Holistics.
[45:44.59]Come on, give us no deaths.
[45:46.22]We didn't have any deaths.
[45:50.20]Hogsport.
[45:51.26]There we go.
[45:51.72]Okay.
[45:53.82]Nobody died.
[45:56.24]My assistant's too highly paid.
[45:59.40]Probably.
[46:01.44]Jumbo Megacorp, Most Prestigious Hospital.
[46:04.84]I'd like to see their staff room, buddy.
[46:08.97]And patient's choice.
[46:10.97]Jumbo Megacorp.
[46:13.12]We got three out of eight.
[46:14.72]That's pretty good.
[46:18.44]That means we're at a three award-winning hospital.
[46:23.22]Staff.
[46:23.57]I feel like he's supposed to be saying things, but just not coming up.
[46:29.71]Pay satisfaction.
[46:30.69]This is cool.
[46:32.53]Staff energy morale.
[46:33.71]Staff morale is high.
[46:37.60]I would sell here.
[46:38.36]There's gonna be a retracement for sure.
[46:40.26]I mean, this is going parabolic.
[46:53.51]Four people got that and I'm just a loser.
[46:56.29]Alright, patience.
[46:58.97]That's not parabolic.
[47:02.69]I just tried.
[47:03.41]I seem smart.
[47:04.87]But like five seconds.
[47:07.13]Does nothing have that?
[47:10.44]Log money.
[47:14.38]There's a lot of zero.
[47:15.36]What about money?
[47:15.86]Let's just see.
[47:17.08]Finance.
[47:18.88]Profit and loss trends.
[47:20.00]Cash up 6% in cash.
[47:21.95]Up 252% in profit factor.
[47:23.01]$52,000 in Bitcoin.
[47:23.51]$0, no loans.
[47:34.65]That's cool.
[47:35.65]You can actually see revenue versus expenses.
[47:39.32]Alright, that's awesome.
[47:40.12]So now let's get out of this.
[47:41.12]Leaderboards.
[47:42.34]Oh, this is like the people you know.
[47:45.06]The log.
[47:47.60]Our doctors have diagnosed a patient with lightheadedness, but it requires a deluxe clinic for treatment.
[47:52.98]Okay, deluxe clinic.
[47:56.91]Deluxe clinic.
[47:58.23]Cures patients with lightheadedness, unscrewing heads since 2017.
[48:07.83]What does it have to be?
[48:08.72]Three by three?
[48:19.72]What's going on?
[48:20.04]What's going on?
[48:20.44]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[48:21.14]Easy, easy, easy.
[48:22.23]Hey.
[48:24.55]What is he, what are you doing?
[48:27.25]He's not gonna shit like in the corner, is he?
[48:38.14]Alright, he's good.
[48:40.02]Who is this?
[48:40.70]Is this a staff member?
[48:41.66]What did he eat?
[48:42.16]Thank god he washed his hands.
[48:44.70]Okay.
[48:48.00]Console.
[48:48.90]Open it.
[48:52.02]The placement is awful.
[48:52.92]It doesn't matter though.
[48:54.21]We just have to get out of the tutorial zone.
[48:58.48]Oscar Lentils is ready for promotion from junior nurse to nurse.
[49:01.32]Promotion from junior nurse to nurse will provide plus one training slot, movement speed, better skill, better treatment, offer a pay rise to keep the staff happy.
[49:09.64]His current salary is $17,000.
[49:10.62]New salary, $21,000.
[49:11.04]Well, you want like a $3,000 or $4,000 raise and you've been here for not even a year?
[49:26.18]To drop your fucking pay.
[49:38.67]Minimum wage.
[49:42.29]Well, we don't know how many hours he's working.
[49:45.69]He could be working for like six hours a week.
[49:51.01]Look, I'll give you 24,000.
[49:51.71]That's as far as I'll go.
[49:59.85]By completing objectives and challenges, our organization earns Kudosh.
[50:04.01]You can use this to gain access to new items.
[50:05.75]Take a look at the items list.
[50:07.11]Any item with a padlock can be unlocked by using K. Best of all, we can then purchase that item in any of our hospitals.
[50:13.62]Use it wisely.
[50:17.10]It was the guy that was shitting his pants.
[50:18.54]Well, that's fine.
[50:20.22]I can relate to that guy.
[50:21.78]He deserves a raise.
[50:23.90]Alright, so we've got a doctor.
[50:24.72]Does the doctor operate this?
[50:27.45]I got two doctors.
[50:28.37]They're just sharing offices.
[50:29.31]Who cares?
[50:29.69]Cure three patients with lightheadedness.
[50:32.69]Check the leaderboards tab.
[50:33.77]I don't care about being the best.
[50:34.83]I just care about being me.
[50:36.83]Let's take a look at this.
[50:37.45]See how it works.
[50:42.80]No anesthetic, by the way.
[50:46.44]Think of how painful that is.
[50:54.38]Oh!
[50:57.45]What if that's not my original head?
[50:58.91]Is this giving me new heads?
[51:02.23]Is he dead?
[51:04.09]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[51:05.25]Hold on a minute.
[51:05.83]This person's gonna die.
[51:08.84]Where'd they go?
[51:09.28]Why does his stomach hurt?
[51:13.92]Are you gonna go die in the bathroom?
[51:28.24]Why does everybody have diarrhea?
[51:32.40]Is it the quality of the food?
[51:33.74]I don't understand.
[51:38.04]Why did you... Did you not cure somebody?
[51:40.84]Do you need more training?
[51:45.38]There we go.
[51:46.06]Okay.
[51:46.50]Cured.
[51:46.84]Why does everybody have diarrhea?
[51:54.06]It's hospital food.
[51:56.19]Well, actually, I mean, it's vending machine food, right?
[52:00.97]Bed face.
[52:01.49]They need to be in bed for a while.
[52:05.98]Okay.
[52:06.74]I probably should put another bed in here.
[52:13.30]No, don't get up.
[52:14.02]I want to put an extra bed in here.
[52:15.46]Why are you leaving?
[52:22.04]Jesus.
[52:22.84]Okay.
[52:24.30]Come back into bed.
[52:28.89]This person's a clown, I think.
[52:32.63]That's how you can tell that you ain't doing so well.
[52:34.99]When you put the hand up for support on the wall, that's next level.
[52:44.42]You know what?
[52:44.80]You put your hand up on the wall like that, guys, because the force of the diarrhea may lift you from the seat.
[52:50.53]That's why you do that instinctively.
[52:53.62]We're talking about such force coming out of your behind that you need to gravitate yourself to the wall.
[53:03.39]Alright, more general diagnostics.
[53:10.79]Lightheaded.
[53:11.11]Just do one more lightheadedness and we're good to go.
[53:16.96]Anybody else have it?
[53:17.62]I think we're short on staff.
[53:22.61]but it doesn't matter.
[53:23.55]I want a profitable hospital.
[53:25.45]Please clean up after yourself and others.
[53:28.69]Is it dirt somewhere?
[53:31.01]Where's hygiene?
[53:32.21]Where's hunger hygiene?
[53:35.51]I got a perfect clean hospital.
[53:37.15]I don't know what they're talking about.
[53:39.37]Boredom?
[53:39.89]Can I put a... These people are really bored.
[53:42.57]Can I put a TV in here?
[53:49.41]No, you're not bored anymore.
[53:50.41]Look, there's a plant to look at.
[53:56.51]Did that work?
[53:59.13]No.
[54:01.45]Plant equals entertainment.
[54:04.18]Well, I don't have any access to anything.
[54:05.82]What about a fire... What about, like, a leaflet stand?
[54:09.70]I can't put it in there.
[54:10.38]I have to unlock the other stuff.
[54:13.02]See?
[54:13.30]Hand sanitizer.
[54:14.70]Gift shop.
[54:16.68]Magazine racks.
[54:17.50]I could take a look at a magazine.
[54:19.30]What's it take?
[54:19.70]Do you want to unlock the bookcase for K75?
[54:22.32]You have K95!
[54:23.54]No!
[54:26.14]I'm saving my K. I'm not spending any of this money.
[54:34.58]Alright, there we go.
[54:35.00]Somewhere with a lightbulb.
[54:39.22]Why is everybody saying Thanos?
[54:40.26]I don't understand.
[54:47.52]Patients whose vet becomes thirsty provide drinks around the hospital.
[54:49.85]I already have it.
[54:53.37]I feel like I need another toilet, but it's okay.
[55:01.21]Alright.
[55:01.83]Three out of three.
[55:02.77]Do it.
[55:04.44]No death.
[55:13.10]Congratulations.
[55:15.71]Now get me out of the tutorial.
[55:17.72]So I can actually make a real hospital.
[55:25.06]And it comes with a hat in there.
[55:26.12]God damn it.
[55:30.14]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[55:31.14]Like, do something quick.
[55:36.75]Don't die somewhere.
[55:38.31]Okay, we... You're not good at this.
[55:42.95]I don't think I want you in here.
[55:46.56]Where's the other doctor?
[55:47.49]Change places, please.
[55:52.37]Yeah, you do this.
[55:55.01]Seriously.
[55:56.63]That's two out of three.
[55:57.95]That this lady is killed.
[56:04.70]Make another bathroom.
[56:05.74]No, we don't need one.
[56:10.34]Options, map.
[56:13.32]I'm almost done with this one.
[56:17.83]Continue.
[56:20.35]Wait, you just took a 17 day break?
[56:26.11]What?
[56:28.44]Hold on, you're just gonna eat snacks for 17 days?
[56:51.13]That's quite the break.
[56:52.85]That's over a half of a month of time.
[57:01.69]What do you get for money?
[57:05.82]He sat for two days.
[57:07.48]I wonder what like drugs he had to take to sit there with his eyes open for two days.
[57:14.36]He was on a spiritual journey.
[57:15.72]Review the salaries of your staff and see how satisfied they are with their pay.
[57:19.73]As staff are promoted and trained, they will expect a higher salary.
[57:22.37]Their pay satisfaction will affect their overall happiness.
[57:24.49]Well, they'll get paid more if I decide that they're doing a good job.
[57:28.54]Alright?
[57:29.46]I'll get rid of them if they're not doing a good job.
[57:34.42]Trying to run a goddamn business here.
[57:40.99]Like the lady that killed two people, you expect a raise?
[57:45.25]no no no no no no no you you if anything you're lucky I still let you on my staff healthcare equals business oh no no I'm talking about not about cost I'm talking about people working in my facility
[58:11.62]The face next to each person's salary indicates their pay satisfaction level.
[58:14.14]To give someone a pay rise, adjust the slider below this salary and then click the confirm button.
[58:18.92]To quickly give pay rises to all people who feel underpaid, use the satisfy pay request button.
[58:25.29]So I can Bruce Almighty this and just like answer every prayer?
[58:30.67]What do you want?
[58:32.49]Satisfied.
[58:33.19]This is satisfied.
[58:36.47]What's wrong with Lauren?
[58:39.07]Wait, this is, no, this is Bruce.
[58:40.17]This is Bruce Fop.
[58:43.34]This guy's getting paid the most.
[58:45.70]He's top second.
[58:46.52]Top two.
[58:46.92]Alright, he's good.
[58:51.62]He's done from his half a month vacation.
[58:53.77]In the waiting room.
[58:55.07]No, no, no, no.
[58:55.87]She's not supposed to be doing this.
[58:58.03]God damn it.
[59:02.99]If this is a three for three dead here, then something's gotta happen.
[59:07.98]Yeah, she's working hungry.
[59:10.34]You gotta eat a Snickers.
[59:11.14]You're not you when you're hungry.
[59:16.08]Ah, we got it.
[59:19.04]Dear hospital, congratulations, your hospital has been awarded a one-star rating.
[59:22.64]That's one out of a possible three by the Two Point Health Ministry.
[59:26.54]I have retrieved your file from my bin to celebrate.
[59:29.91]Wait, he put it in the trash.
[59:31.65]Continue to develop your enterprise in Hogsport for further esteem and trinkets if you believe that you're capable of more.
[59:37.85]Alternatively,
[59:39.58]Run before you can walk and begin to expand your organization by opening a new hospital in Lower Bullocks.
[59:44.54]The choice is yours.
[59:47.41]Let's do it.
[59:47.67]Rise and shine, everyone.
[59:49.93]And if you happen to be in Lower Bullocks this morning, watch out for the gathering of druids down at Grogben's Ring.
[59:58.53]In a total coincidence, the town will also pay host to a psychology convention today.
[60:04.88]Should all work out nicely.
[60:07.36]I didn't know they had NPR on here.
[60:10.89]That was clearly NPR.
[60:13.10]Alright, let's go over here.
[60:16.52]Expand the organization by establishing a second hospital.
[60:18.53]Alright, this is the one I'm going to take dead seriously.
[60:20.47]Dead serious.
[60:24.11]We're talking...
[60:27.27]uh, good s- uh, s- placements.
[60:31.53]That's what we're talking about.
[60:32.91]Welcome to Lower Bullocks!
[60:34.35]It's a lovely little village with a big problem.
[60:37.71]A significant portion of the population believe themselves to be rock stars.
[60:41.69]There's only one thing that can cure this.
[60:44.48]Psychiatry.
[60:46.60]Only doctors with a psychiatry qualification will be able to diagnose and treat people in a psychiatric room.
[60:53.50]We've managed to find one.
[60:56.02]but you should keep your eyes peeled for job applicants with psychiatry and other useful qualifications.
[61:04.64]Okay, good.
[61:07.96]Build an impressive psychiatry room to keep people happy.
[61:12.12]So this is, is this psychiatry or what is this?
[61:15.28]This is the GP's office.
[61:16.28]We don't have a psychiatry room.
[61:18.44]Alright, I didn't do this.
[61:20.74]Everyone that's gonna make fun of me for putting it, I didn't make this.
[61:22.86]So don't make fun of me for putting it here.
[61:25.85]Alright, psychiatry.
[61:28.57]We need psychiatry.
[61:32.69]It needs to be three by three.
[61:34.05]Let's just put it in the corner here.
[61:39.27]That's good.
[61:41.13]Right here.
[61:43.21]Put the chair in here.
[61:45.99]And then put the couch this way.
[61:48.19]Right?
[61:48.33]Isn't this how it usually is?
[61:49.21]Put a plant in here.
[61:51.25]Just because, right?
[61:57.10]And then put up... See how patients with lightheadedness are wired.
[62:01.76]Should I put... No, that's... No, I'm not going to do that.
[62:05.56]Let's put a trash barrel right next to the... Right there.
[62:08.57]Okay.
[62:08.95]Filing cabinet.
[62:13.57]Corner.
[62:16.55]He placed it in the middle.
[62:17.41]He's dumb.
[62:19.14]I will forget about this, so let's get it somewhere already.
[62:21.40]Right here.
[62:21.86]Okay.
[62:24.26]Okay.
[62:25.74]Now I need a psychiatrist.
[62:29.68]We've been contacted by Bungle Technologies, who run various research hospitals across the country.
[62:34.64]They have an interesting proposition for us.
[62:36.48]Their psychiatry license was recently revoked due to an incident with... Well, it's best not to go into it.
[62:42.40]They want to send us psychiatry patients, and an exchange will allow us to buy some of their latest technology.
[62:47.69]Until our organization acquires a research license, we need all the technology we can get our hands on.
[62:54.04]Let's build up the hospital a little bit while we deal with some of the psychiatry patients from Bungle.
[62:59.74]Uh, get hospital level 3.
[63:00.66]Uh-huh.
[63:01.02]What?
[63:08.81]Okay.
[63:09.15]Doctor?
[63:09.53]Let's go see what, uh... I'm curious what's going on with this guy.
[63:27.08]Alright, he thinks he's a mock star.
[63:30.86]Alright, so they're all just Freddie Mercury's.
[63:36.19]So where are they supposed to go?
[63:38.47]Oh wait, I need a psychiatrist.
[63:41.09]Okay, doctors.
[63:44.55]Mac Muling and Amy Curious.
[63:49.43]This person has psychiatry.
[63:53.65]Psychiatry, psychiatry, two, let's get it.
[63:57.79]This is $54,000.
[63:58.13]Wait, what?
[63:59.27]No, you're not a psychiatrist, get out of here.
[64:03.04]Let's get a second opinion.
[64:10.74]You need to be in there.
[64:11.68]Oh my God, they're everywhere.
[64:18.11]I need another, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[64:20.85]Roams, psychiatry, we need like two or three of these.
[64:24.66]Why are these over here?
[64:33.08]I need at least a few of these.
[64:50.91]Another psychiatrist.
[64:52.61]Alright.
[64:52.83]Because they're kind of just... They're just everywhere right now.
[64:58.89]Oh, I need a bathroom.
[65:00.67]Bathroom.
[65:01.25]I need a bathroom.
[65:03.82]Pharmacy.
[65:04.34]No, I need a staff room.
[65:05.92]Bathroom first.
[65:06.86]Bathroom's going to be like right... Very close, right?
[65:09.80]Centrally located.
[65:14.34]Go.
[65:14.62]I should have put it in the corner.
[65:17.59]But then people have to walk a long ways.
[65:21.43]Shit.
[65:21.78]Okay, that's fine.
[65:24.34]Sink and a hand dryer.
[65:27.58]And that's it.
[65:28.42]Two bathrooms in there.
[65:29.41]But how do I, that's... Get the psychiatrist into the right room.
[65:34.51]I know, I just gotta, hold on a minute.
[65:36.24]I gotta look around.
[65:38.70]Bungle has given us access to some of their latest technology, a pharmacy drug mixer upgrade, and a general diagnosis easy scan machine upgrade.
[65:46.68]If we buy these for our machines, they will become more powerful, helping us diagnose and cure more patients.
[65:51.86]To upgrade a machine, we'll need a janitor with a mechanic's qualification.
[65:56.00]Select the machine and choose the upgrade option.
[65:57.68]A qualified janitor will then upgrade the machine over time.
[66:00.68]Give it a try, and they might have more for us soon.
[66:03.30]Easy scan unlocked.
[66:06.20]Where's the correct... Is this the guy?
[66:09.58]Who's the guy that's the super psychiatrist?
[66:11.30]It's not this guy.
[66:13.14]No, this guy needs to be in the other room.
[66:14.62]Get over here.
[66:16.99]No, no, no, no, no.
[66:18.15]I don't know who it was.
[66:19.51]Who's the right one?
[66:21.33]No, get out of here.
[66:23.51]You're the wrong doctor.
[66:24.55]I picked up the fucking chair.
[66:28.11]No.
[66:29.65]You.

[67:14.41]Click on a patient in the list to jump to that person in the hospital.
[67:16.61]Click on the arrows by each column heading to the sort the list based on that column.
[67:19.65]Okay.
[67:21.03]So they're happy.

[70:19.46]Got two psychiatric offices back to back.
[70:22.64]Actually, let's put the ward back here.
[70:25.82]Like in this corner.
[70:28.50]This has to be a larger room.
[70:29.54]So four by three.

[71:16.85]Don't see me as that kind of guy, please.
[71:19.78]Like, don't see me as that.
[71:22.12]That was an extreme low-hanging fruit.
[71:26.22]And I want to be on record saying that I'm sorry about that.
[71:28.82]And I apologize first for that.
[71:32.14]I'm sorry that I just did that.
[71:35.19]Uh, great.
[71:35.51]The machine upgrade is complete.
[71:36.35]Make sure we've got a few fire extinguishers dotted around to keep precious machines safe.
[71:42.41]Uh... Have given us access to one of their machines, the extractor pan.
[71:46.15]This high-tech gadget is great for removal of unwanted kitchen utensils.
[71:49.85]Look out for people in need of this.
[71:51.75]Continue expanding the hospital to unlock some more technology.
[71:53.81]Buying another plot of land nearby will give us more space to develop the hospital.
[71:57.65]We can buy more land.
[72:00.59]However, if a plot of land... Ooh.
[72:02.13]Ooh!
[72:06.86]You gotta be careful.
[72:07.48]If you get your ball in here, good luck getting it on the green.
[72:10.48]You know what I'm saying?
[72:13.85]Alright, this is gonna take a few days to do.

[102:12.70]Alright, I'm just curious.
[102:14.22]Let me open the map.
[102:14.82]A warm greeting to you all this fine morning, especially those of you in Fluttering, where renovations have been completed on the bridge that leads to the town's ancient castle.
[102:25.70]Officials say people crossing over will no longer need to wear parachutes and life jackets.
[102:31.34]That's good.
[102:31.98]It just won't be the same.
[102:33.36]Alright.
[102:37.46]Let me see.
[102:37.76]How long have I been scraping for?
[102:38.70]Let me see.
[102:39.48]What can we do?
[102:42.96]Streaming for, like, just about two hours.
[102:46.80]Um... Let's take a gander here.
[102:55.44]You want us to start juggling on camera?
[102:59.06]We can do that.
[103:01.18]You wanna play Spider-Man?
[103:02.66]Like, tomorrow or something?
[103:03.50]I haven't even, like, showered.
[103:11.40]Did I shower today?
[103:16.26]Gamble on camera.
[103:17.24]I don't have access to gambling.
[103:23.63]We want to make the update video.
[103:25.25]No, I'm going to do that in private.
[103:27.49]Let me just pee.
[103:28.43]I'll come back.
[103:29.69]The stream's not over.
[103:30.65]We're going to figure out what we're going to do for another couple hours or so.
[103:33.44]We'll see what we're going to do.
[103:34.64]I'll be right back.
