[00:00.47]Why are we playing oil divers?
[00:02.13]Why are we doing this?
[00:03.07]What's the- I'm not fucking doing it right.
[00:04.79]I'm not- I'm not giving up.
[00:05.52]You're doing it bad now.
[00:06.48]And you said oil divers.
[00:09.34]I don't even know where that came from.
[00:17.16]That was awesome.
[00:18.50]That's kind of cool.
[00:19.91]Nice job.
[00:21.57]Nice work.
[00:21.97]What?
[00:24.67]What?
[00:36.31]Alright, let's go!
[00:37.41]Let's do this!
[00:41.01]You just called in a clone of yourself and shoot him and kill him.
[00:45.69]Not the real one.
[00:46.91]I'm gonna get both going at the same time here.
[00:50.96]How are you doing?
[00:51.70]Alright, you know when you scratch your head and rub your belly?
[00:54.30]This is impossible.
[00:55.26]That's what this is.
[00:56.66]This, I...
[00:58.57]I'm killing mine.
[01:00.41]I'm putting my mouse down here too.
[01:02.97]No.
[01:03.69]No.
[01:04.73]No.
[01:06.15]No.
[01:07.87]You're not doing this.
[01:08.77]No, come on.
[01:10.64]I had my mouse on my lap.
[01:13.78]No, stop summoning the Jerma clone.
[01:18.30]I need to do it.
[01:19.66]Don't kill him.
[01:21.48]It's really important.
[01:22.20]You can kill your clone.
[01:23.28]I want to keep my clone.
[01:25.11]There can only be one.
[01:26.33]You're going to use my chin.
[01:30.30]Okay, here we go.
[01:32.18]Oh my god.
[01:33.94]If he makes it out of this mission.
[01:36.75]Alright, that's my goal.
[01:37.61]I have to keep him alive.
[01:39.85]Oh no, I'll save you, Jerma.
[01:41.67]Thanks, I appreciate it.
[01:42.91]No problem.
[01:44.19]Alright, let's go.
[01:44.75]Let's kill him.
[01:47.51]Where's my bombs?
[01:50.11]Nice work.
[01:52.45]Close, dude.
[01:52.89]Close.
[01:53.21]Nice.
[01:54.40]Easy, easy.
[01:56.16]Thanks, man.
[01:56.54]I appreciate that.
[01:57.22]No problem.
[01:58.34]Tunnel's coming in pretty soon here.
[02:00.39]We all made it out alive, see?
[02:03.82]We all made it out alive.
[02:05.96]All it took was just to save our clones.
[02:08.16]Oh, come on!
[02:08.94]No!
[02:12.16]Damn it!
[02:14.42]My clone!
[02:15.20]Why aren't you helping?
[02:28.01]Come on!
[02:30.02]Come on!
[02:35.06]Sorry, I'm trying to play two people at the same time while you just chill.
[02:38.84]I was playing!
[02:39.88]I just wasn't, like, making jokes.
[02:41.74]Oh, let's do the mission again.
[02:44.12]You know, it's fine if you kill me as long as you don't insta-die afterwards.
[02:50.83]On two characters, you insta-die twice.
[02:56.83]No, it's completely not intentional.
[02:59.53]I promise.
[03:00.93]Okay, let's go.
[03:01.73]If they're not directly touching... Fuck!
[03:08.93]Hold on, which one is this?
[03:10.93]You're the real one.
[03:12.37]I'm the real one.
[03:21.18]What even killed me?
[03:22.78]Yeah, nothing touched you.
[03:23.82]I understand why I'm dead.
[03:26.46]But, uh, you're gonna have to... Uh, what are you doing?
[03:30.22]Okay, that... That was... I thought it was like a fire thing shooting out.
[03:35.73]Don't worry, I've got it back.
[03:37.05]Oh, don't worry!
[03:37.51]Here comes Star Zero!
[03:39.43]Just have the clone join the game.
[03:41.11]We're safe.
[03:41.57]We didn't lose.
[03:42.79]We were seriously just playing on the difficulty that is for children.
[03:48.76]Like, you play that difficulty if you have no idea how to play video games.
[03:53.11]And somehow it still took us four tries.
[03:58.31]Activate truth transmitters.
[04:00.87]Alright.
[04:02.15]As soon as I activate that, you'd better start telling the honest truth.
[04:05.25]I pissed my bed when I was 12.
[04:09.16]I did.
[04:09.46]A lot.
[04:12.98]I did too.
[04:19.47]oh so what we're gonna do is actually try and avoid them too bad and you instantly killed me you're like eating potato chips I I hear you just like eating chips no I'm what are you I'm not eating anything
[04:47.84]That what you heard is I'm doing Christmas decorations.
[04:50.29]I'm wrapping a present.
[04:52.29]That's worse.
[04:55.83]It's almost done.
[04:56.49]There we go.
[04:57.79]A new iPad for little Tim.
