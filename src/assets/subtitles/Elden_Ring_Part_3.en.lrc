[00:02.07]What's up?
[00:05.87]What's up?
[00:11.32]What's up?
[00:13.02]Hey, how are you?
[00:13.58]How you doing?
[00:15.34]Welcome back.
[00:16.72]Another day, day three of Elden Ring.
[00:24.38]I'll be your host for the festivities today as we continue to trek through the Lands Between
[00:41.36]Horse?
[00:41.66]What?
[00:44.40]Like the title?
[00:44.98]Yeah.
[00:46.98]How's my day been?
[00:47.60]It's been pretty good.
[00:51.52]I want to play this game so bad.
[00:53.28]I was talking to Holly last night.
[00:55.40]And I was like, hey, like, what if I made like another character?
[00:58.69]Just like I played like at the same time.
[01:01.15]But then I realized if I were to play this game off stream, I wouldn't, there would be no time for me to sleep or eat.
[01:11.61]Because I stopped the stream last night at, what, like, 10, 11, PM, 12, something like that?
[01:17.04]The night before was, like, 2 o'clock in the morning.
[01:20.12]If I would play off stream after that, there's no time for me to go to bed.
[01:27.48]Like, I'm just going to bed, waking up, doing some, like, morning routine, early afternoon routine stuff, and then, like, playing this game for 10 straight hours.
[01:41.38]So, I don't have time to make a new character.
[01:49.73]You're addicted.
[01:51.39]Yeah, I mean, it's a good feeling, though.
[01:54.65]It's a really good feeling.
[01:55.75]It's been a long time.
[01:59.44]If you're going to get three streams that are eight to nine to ten hours in a row on this channel, you better believe that I'm very, very interested in the thing that I'm streaming.
[02:11.07]When was the last time I streamed anything three times in a row?
[02:14.61]Ever.
[02:16.43]Besides Dollhouse.
[02:19.98]It's been a very long time.
[02:24.84]House Flipper?
[02:25.34]Was House Flipper three streams in a row, though?
[02:28.98]I don't think it was.
[02:30.20]Sometimes I'll do two.
[02:32.70]And then I'll take like three or four days and then do it again.
[02:35.22]But this is... It's been a while.
[02:37.50]How have I been feeling?
[02:39.79]Um...
[02:43.11]I don't want to like concern anybody because if I say the wrong thing here, then people are going to get concerned.
[02:50.17]So without doing that, let me just tell you that I've been fine.
[02:54.72]I've been monitoring and managing how my body feels.
[02:58.26]I'm doing alright.
[02:59.74]I'm doing good.
[03:05.84]But I would be lying if I told you that it wasn't, I didn't feel it.
[03:11.37]I have been taking a Tylenol pretty much every day here.
[03:16.87]One dose.
[03:19.07]Kind of right before I start.
[03:24.27]I'm doing good.
[03:27.36]And it works.
[03:28.64]It helps enough for it to be like, I'm fine.
[03:32.10]He's addicted to Tylenol.
[03:33.46]No, I'm not.
[03:34.52]It's been... It's literally... I've been taking Tylenol... The last time I took Tylenol was probably like...
[03:39.55]I don't know, maybe like fucking two, a month or two ago?
[03:42.15]Two months ago?
[03:42.78]No, and what I, I, look, I, I know, I know that like,
[03:54.06]Jerma's an idiot!
[03:55.12]He's gonna take too much Tylenol!
[03:58.60]Trust me when I say, like, medical shit.
[04:01.46]I'm very, very much aware of everything.
[04:03.50]I'm very much in tune with how, like, what you should and shouldn't be doing.
[04:06.72]Trust me.
[04:07.84]I know the exact amount of milligrams of acetaminophen that you really can't take in a 24-hour period.
[04:15.00]Trust me.
[04:15.37]I'm very aware of my body.
[04:23.15]And I am taking, on a daily basis here, well below 50% of what is even addressed on the bottle.
[04:33.08]So, don't worry.
[04:33.98]I'm gonna be fine.
[04:36.34]But I know people might have been concerned about, dude, do you really think you should be doing this?
[04:40.86]Like 10 hour streams, 3 days in a row, like 30 hours of streaming in a row?
[04:45.63]And you have very- you have a right to be concerned, right?
[04:47.73]Because obviously, like, over the years it's been like, hey, I have a bunch of medical problems.
[04:51.92]But I'm good.
[04:52.80]I'm good.
[04:53.97]And we'll see how we feel tonight.
[04:54.95]There's a very real chance that maybe tonight I'm like, let's go again tomorrow.
[04:59.99]We'll see.
[05:00.19]Are there any updates on the medical stuff?
[05:06.08]No, not really.
[05:06.84]And I probably would rather not share it anyways because I feel like...
[05:11.50]It's kind of, um, it's kind of like a downer.
[05:14.64]If you haven't heard me talk about it too much recently, because... It's just a downer.
[05:18.93]It just is.
[05:20.59]And I would rather, like, have the mood of these streams be a place where, like, I can just have fun and we can just kind of chill.
[05:25.13]And just do whatever and have a good time.
[05:26.39]Than have to, like, you know, every week or two kind of tell you guys, like, how I'm feeling and how, like, my back hurts and my chest hurts or...
[05:34.33]Because I did that for a little while.
[05:35.53]I did.
[05:36.19]I did that for like, I don't know, there was a period where like a few months in a row.
[05:40.02]It's like, it felt like that was kind of half the shit that I talked about.
[05:44.06]So I would rather just kind of not have to talk about it really.
[05:46.66]Just deal with it on my own.
[05:48.87]And if there's something significant that I would ever tell you about, obviously I would.
[05:53.25]Especially if it was going to affect the streams and, you know, if I was going to need to take time or something.
[05:58.54]But it's kind of a downer, and I don't want to make it a downer.
[06:00.57]Because it's something I really don't like to focus on anyways.
[06:04.33]But, that's it.
[06:12.38]Guys, every hour he's gonna... Actually, I thought about making the title...
[06:16.16]Uh, guaranteed loud sound every 30 minutes.
[06:19.92]Please adjust your volume.
[06:22.08]Um, but I kind of feel like that would be like a deterrent for people like to not even click on the stream.
[06:27.56]Because that means, that doesn't mean what you guys think it means.
[06:33.49]Oh, he's going to scream.
[06:34.45]He's going to yell.
[06:35.21]To me, as somebody that's an outside viewer that might not know this channel, that could mean I'm going to just do an ear blast sound every 30 minutes to be funny.
[06:45.06]And air horns.
[06:47.20]I don't think I would want to click on that stream.
[06:48.84]Because if you click on that stream and you're in that period where it's like 10 seconds until a noise, what if you're not ready?
[06:57.77]It would be a good bit.
[06:59.30]Yeah, but good bits are only funny, you know, if everybody can enjoy them, right?
[07:06.57]Uh, I think that... ...having a bit that's funny and that... Look, people would come in, maybe, and they'd be like, okay, this, wait, there's no, like, gonna be, like, air horns in my ears?
[07:25.26]Make a loud sound now.
[07:28.72]Bicycle honk every time a runes are lost Anyways, yeah, there you go life update It's time to play Elden Ring ready Very excitable and get a look what I got right here.
[07:47.64]I'll show you right now I'll take a quick look you'll see it Got I'm prepared
[07:59.81]Very prepared.
[08:07.80]God, of course.
[08:09.12]What would a 10-hour stream be without my fucking magical matcha powder?
[08:16.79]What would a stream be without my magical matcha powder?
[08:24.55]Green shirt.
[08:25.99]It's a dollar shirt.
[08:29.86]These actually fit really well and they're really comfortable.
[08:35.06]I was just saying that because this is my own merch.
[08:40.23]You look uncanny valley today.
[08:41.73]Shut the fuck up.
[08:50.26]Respectfully.
[09:01.14]Alright, so what were we doing?
[09:09.33]Uncanny in a handsome way.
[09:11.07]I'm just fucking around.
[09:12.95]Okay.
[09:15.21]There are some things that I... The last thing I did was I beat that sewer boss.
[09:21.81]I need to start focusing on mind because I don't have enough... I beat that boss so early.
[09:31.12]I don't even have enough mana to summon the guy that you get for a reward for beating that boss.
[09:36.59]So... I have to... I want to get mined up because I feel like that could be a huge, huge game changer.
[09:46.54]You beat the game already?
[09:47.32]This is pain.
[09:48.44]Also, please permanently ban me.
[09:53.74]I'm thinking about it.
[09:54.38]I'm thinking about if you should get permanently banned or not.
[09:57.56]Probably.
[09:58.43]Probably.
[10:00.06]But I'm gonna do the thing you don't want.
[10:02.02]And that's not do anything.
[10:04.29]Yeah.
[10:05.17]Yeah, okay.
[10:06.59]You just get to sit here and, like, just chat and chill and have a good time.
[10:12.63]Fucking idiot.
[10:15.03]You just get to, like, hang out and, like, talk and, like, enjoy, like, the company of the other community members.
[10:21.24]Fucking moron.
[10:24.08]Can't fucking believe it.
[10:25.14]Got him.
[10:25.82]Yeah.
[10:26.58]Get rid of him.
[10:27.36]Yeah, got him.
[10:29.98]Alright.
[10:36.78]I need to go here.
[10:41.97]There's a few spots.
[10:44.09]I don't know what the hell happened over here, but I ended up over here.
[10:51.30]Look at the map.
[10:51.94]It's cut in half.
[10:53.77]I'm not supposed to be over here.
[10:55.09]And, like, I was doing shit over here.
[10:56.61]So, I definitely have to be, like, over here.
[10:59.03]Or, like, here.
[11:00.68]I'm not supposed to be there.
[11:01.86]The game's like, what are you doing, dude?
[11:07.02]It was rejected.
[11:07.68]Wait, what?
[11:08.50]Wait, what did Holly say?
[11:10.18]I have to go.
[11:11.48]I have to wash some shirts.
[11:12.98]He's been sweating through them all.
[11:21.49]I've gone through like, I mean, I'll be honest, I've gone through probably like seven t-shirts.
[11:26.11]Like six t-shirts in the last like three days, two days.
[11:34.68]I can't help it, I'm fucking disgusting.
[11:36.74]What do you want me to tell you?
[11:38.00]My room is hot.
[11:40.87]The shirts are like suffocating.
[11:43.17]This is why...
[11:45.84]I don't have... I don't have the balls to do this.
[11:48.80]But, like, imagine if I was just sitting here with no shirt on.
[11:51.36]Just sitting here.
[11:52.30]I would be doing that right now.
[11:54.12]I really would be.
[11:55.45]But, like, I don't think... I can't do that at this point.
[11:57.69]Right?
[11:57.99]Like, I can't.
[12:01.33]I would be sitting here like this.
[12:02.83]I'd have, like, a cigarette.
[12:04.34]Just, like, hanging out of my mouth.
[12:05.58]Ah, shit, man.
[12:09.18]Fuck.
[12:12.30]I do like huge burps and shit.
[12:14.20]If only I could just be the real me on camera.
[12:21.47]We're gonna go up this way.
[12:28.39]You can literally... I'm just kidding around.
[12:32.06]He's unleashed.
[12:35.16]No, I don't want to have my fucking shirt off on camera.
[12:39.59]Like, oh, yeah, let's just be comfy and, like, have, like, just sit there with no shirt on.
[12:43.27]I can imagine the amount of people that would just, like, just zoom in on my fucking belly button.
[12:46.33]Like, what?
[12:47.05]Get the fuck out of here.
[12:48.03]Like, you know what I mean?
[12:48.63]Like... Like, I'm not doing... I don't... That's why.
[12:56.04]Yeah, because guess what?
[12:57.20]I have my shirt off just, like, chilling, comfortable, like, on cam, whatever.
[13:00.82]And, like, some of you guys are going to zoom into my belly button...
[13:04.36]prop it really close draw eyes up above the belly button add some like like a lip uh detail like to the belly button and put a nose on it and be like oh new Jerma character like belly button Andy or something and it's and that that would be that would be on the front page of fucking every Reddit or something like that would be on my Reddit that would be on there'd be everywhere and like you you would like make that a character I I wouldn't have any control over it
[13:33.36]He must have thought about this way too much.
[13:37.10]What's that?
[13:39.93]They definitely will.
[13:40.49]Yeah, of course they will!
[13:41.39]Like, what do you mean?
[13:42.13]Oh, he's gonna show his belly button.
[13:56.40]Your character is ugly?
[14:00.74]Well, I mean... I mean, I based it off of you.
[14:06.46]I need a glintstone key.
[14:14.55]I'm like just I'm just doing burns today Elden Ring just kind of makes me like mean Be a tank top streamer.
[14:27.82]Oh, I'm just gonna wear whatever makes me comfortable He's wicked toxic today
[14:36.57]Alright, let's go.
[14:37.73]I need to go up here.
[14:39.33]This is where the academy is, right?
[14:41.07]This is the sorcery place.
[14:43.33]We're going to go here.
[14:44.00]There's going to be a shitload of sorcery items.
[14:46.70]Because why would he say, Oh, yes.
[14:49.24]Oh, the sorcery tower.
[14:50.72]The sorcery kingdom.
[14:52.76]Oh, the academy of sorcerers.
[14:54.54]There's going to be a cool-ass weapon here, and I'm going to be able to use it.
[15:00.99]So, this way.
[15:04.93]Let's go.
[15:07.94]Apologize right now or do the Goku.
[15:09.59]It's the same effect.
[15:11.13]Oh, I don't know.
[15:11.79]I don't know.
[15:12.49]We meet Goku.
[15:14.43]Really?
[15:14.85]I'm re... I am so... Goku.
[15:16.81]You know, I'm really... I need to really... I need to really... Goku.
[15:20.45]Something to you guys.
[15:21.09]I need to... I'm very, very... Goku.
[15:30.27]Hope you got that.
[15:31.95]I hope that came through.
[15:33.38]I hope it was genuine.
[15:36.79]Okay, I can't go this way.
[15:37.93]So how the fuck do I get over there?
[15:39.35]Alright, there's a path over there.
[15:40.39]That way.
[15:49.81]God, I love this game.
[15:54.44]That path connects... Where?
[16:01.70]Here?
[16:04.12]Is there water in between?
[16:05.09]No, there's not like a lake or anything.
[16:06.33]Alright, so I think I can drop down and not die.
[16:09.47]Please.
[16:10.23]Everybody pray!
[16:15.63]Will I die from this?
[16:34.59]I prayed for you to die.
[16:35.93]Oh, there's a funny one-guy moment that I saw after the fact.
[16:39.81]When I was dying over and over again, and I was complaining about all the gravestones, the graveyard boss, I remember like, oh, the gravestones.
[16:46.38]I specifically was really, really pissed off, and I was saying, what the fuck is this?
[16:50.48]Why are there so many gravestones here?
[16:51.98]How many people have died here?
[16:53.10]This is fucking ridiculous.
[16:54.67]Somebody in chat said, they're all your gravestones.
[16:59.93]And it was like, holy shit, I wish I caught that.
[17:01.59]That was fucking hilarious.
[17:04.39]audio is delayed I don't think it is audio like wait game audio or you mean like me I have a really weird way of talking
[17:19.49]I think people, like, come to the stream, and they, when I have cam on, like, my voice has its own mouth that makes, like, sounds.
[17:26.91]Like, my, down here, I can just sit here like this, and my vocal cords are just actually, they're talking under, there's lips down here moving.
[17:36.11]Like, I can actually do that, so.
[17:39.76]When I talk, my lips don't move maybe that much, maybe as much as you think they should be.
[17:48.14]I don't know.
[17:48.88]Because people always go, dude, your audio is like delayed.
[17:51.14]Like sometimes your mouth doesn't move.
[17:52.24]And it's like, well, I don't know, man.
[17:53.12]I've got like, I've got like a mouth down here.
[18:02.37]I'm losing my mind.
[18:03.83]He's, this dude is working.
[18:06.67]Alright.
[18:06.91]Where do I go?
[18:07.97]Where do I go?
[18:08.59]I don't know where to go.
[18:09.69]Okay.
[18:09.99]I'm fucking, I need to settle down because like, I don't know why I act like this when I play these games.
[18:17.12]Like, something about FromSoftware games just, like, open up some weird thing in my brain where, like, I'm constantly just not being serious and just constantly just fucking around.
[18:27.34]It never stops.
[18:28.59]It only stops when I go into a boss room and then I get, like, mad and I hate everybody.
[18:34.63]It's weird.
[18:38.23]How the fuck do I get over there?
[18:46.50]He's having so much fucking fun, MonkaS.
[18:48.89]I think that might be what it is.
[18:50.01]Oh, wait.
[18:54.36]Oh, okay.
[18:59.38]Alright, this is it right here.
[19:01.60]Very good, very good, very good, very good.
[19:03.08]By the way, the more, the less that I move my lips, the less calories that I burn in my, like, mouth.
[19:07.97]So it means I can talk way longer.
[19:11.11]Because my mouth doesn't get, like, tired by, like, talking.
[19:13.61]So, like, I can rest my mouth and I can really speak very, very clearly for a long period of time.
[19:22.52]Alright, finally, let's go.
[19:23.88]Stream begins now.
[19:30.33]Okay, Microwave Boy.
[19:38.17]Microwave Boy.
[19:44.29]That sounds like a really, really stupid, shitty superhero.
[19:51.07]Microwave Boy!
[19:52.09]To save the day!
[19:52.82]Oh, how did you get your powers?
[19:55.51]I was making popcorn one day and I opened it up midway through and I breathed in too much of the microwave radiation.
[20:05.03]Oh.
[20:05.15]I accidentally microwaved myself.
[20:11.83]Okay.
[20:12.77]What?
[20:16.27]How?
[20:23.34]He eats up too many Hot Pockets.
[20:27.23]I don't know how I got all that.
[20:29.31]You can shoot radio waves through his fingers and it's like, well, what happened, dude?
[20:33.37]I ate four Hot Pockets a day for ten years.
[20:52.26]Oh, no, he's slipping into doof?
[20:53.62]Alright, watch out, watch out.
[20:58.82]Get out of here.
[21:05.56]Whoa, we've got a sorcerer.
[21:09.22]We must be getting close to the academy.
[21:24.08]Ooh, gauntlets.
[21:36.91]This is going to be a big deal.
[21:37.75]I actually can't wait to be here.
[21:38.73]I think that's it up there.
[21:43.44]The big castle looking thing.
[21:48.28]Oh, fine.
[21:48.76]Let's go.
[21:49.22]Take him on.
[21:56.37]Oh, fine.
[21:56.93]Let's go.
[21:57.43]Take him on then.
[21:58.11]Finally.
[21:58.47]Okay.
[22:04.97]So, I got my flasks refilled because I cleared the camp.
[22:07.96]Let's go explore.
[22:09.30]Doofenshmirtz or Riot.
[22:12.16]I just... I offhandedly did a Doofenshmirtz.
[22:14.82]I don't think I can even do it again if I really even tried.
[22:16.44]Oh!
[22:17.04]I could probably do it.
[22:17.66]I can't do it.
[22:25.05]I need to hear it a few times.
[22:27.97]If I were to listen to it, if I were to watch an episode of Phineas and Ferb, I would probably do a much better job because I need to hear it.
[22:41.70]So anything else here?
[22:49.28]I don't think so.
[22:50.06]I got like that cookbook thing.
[22:51.76]Which I have to sit down.
[22:52.76]And I know like stalling, stalling, hurry up and play the game.
[22:56.46]But I do need to sit down and figure out all the cooking, cookbook crafting stuff.
[23:04.71]That's something that needs to be done.
[23:14.61]This place is pretty narrow, so wait.
[23:16.19]Oh, it's over here.
[23:22.69]Can we move on to the academy, or do I go look at the lake and get a dragon to drop on me again?
[23:33.69]Go in the tent, please.
[23:34.71]Tent, please.
[23:35.43]Please, the tent.
[23:37.53]Shut up!
[23:41.21]Sorry, I can't.
[23:41.95]I gotta stop.
[23:43.46]Just stop.
[23:46.06]It's, like, too much fun to just, like, pretend to, like, be mad at people.
[23:49.20]I don't know.
[23:49.60]I don't know.
[23:50.04]This game just is weird to me.
[23:52.77]What tent?
[23:53.25]A tent? 139.29.
[24:19.57]I don't know what you mean by tent.
[24:26.92]There's nothing in any of these tents.
[24:28.02]Oh, I was going to leave.
[24:35.78]You're pretending.
[24:37.92]I, honest to God, I don't... I think you just fucking leave.
[24:40.88]What's in one of the tents...
[24:45.10]Guys, I'm only streaming for like 10 hours today.
[24:46.80]We don't have time for this.
[24:47.78]What?
[24:48.92]Where?
[24:50.50]In the tent.
[24:55.35]How was I supposed to see that?
[24:56.25]There's nothing even in here.
[24:57.11]It's just a smoldering butterfly.
[25:08.98]You guys are acting like it was a fucking greatsword.
[25:19.63]I don't know how people see that shit.
[25:21.19]How do you even see that?
[25:25.41]What?
[25:26.05]Wow, that looks cool.
[25:27.51]We're taking a second here.
[25:31.13]Wow.
[25:32.37]This is so cool.
[25:33.96]This looks unbelievable.
[25:39.34]That does look so good.
[25:46.65]Oh, I can already see.
[25:48.09]I can already see the Vaati videos on this game.
[25:50.55]Right?
[25:50.83]Like, I can't wait.
[25:51.97]I can't wait to beat this game, have no fucking idea what happened, have absolutely no idea who any of the characters' names are, and then watch, like, four hours of Vaati videos.
[26:02.30]Where he gets to tell me everything.
[26:05.32]He'll just tell me literally everything I need to know.
[26:14.73]Okay, so what's over here?
[26:16.77]And then forget it again, and then forget it again, and come back a year later, and watch the same VATY videos a year later, to be like, oh yeah, yeah, that game's great.
[26:27.02]That story was pretty cool.
[26:30.43]It's only got one, once a year rotation.
[26:42.80]that a crab or is it a turtle or is that one of those oh let's just go get it that was one of those like pus bubbles
[27:08.27]I rea- okay, it's- I know they've had a lot of time to see what other, like, worlds look like and shit.
[27:16.05]But, as much as I talk shit about, like, some of the stuff that I don't like about, you know, like, dar- Oh, the bosses delay the attack delays!
[27:22.86]This is the first time that FromSoftware's made an open world game.
[27:27.78]And it's... The actual open world is fucking unbelievable.
[27:32.86]Like, un-fucking-believable.
[27:37.61]How come companies that have been spending two decades making open world games still can't seem to get it right?
[27:48.07]I don't get it.
[27:53.76]Seems kind of empty.
[27:57.03]I don't, um, no, I don't think so.
[27:59.07]I think we see, like, random camps, we see random shit happen all the time.
[28:02.77]Um, but just like art, like, just artistically, right?
[28:04.99]Just like the aesthetic of an open world.
[28:07.59]Everywhere feels really different and really interesting, but really connected at the same time.
[28:15.23]It's just, it's, it's just beautiful.
[28:16.73]It's just amazingly put together.
[28:18.31]Like, at least the actual, like, technical kind of artistic representation of it.
[28:27.57]Just take a picture.
[28:28.57]This is a screenshot game.
[28:29.65]It is.
[28:31.83]What is this?
[28:35.03]What is this?
[28:35.85]Flintstone Firefly?
[28:40.13]What is that?
[28:40.73]Where is it?
[28:52.13]Materials for crafting items.
[28:56.47]Blast, now that his tail is a glintstone, it can no longer beguile potential mates.
[29:04.71]So it's a crafting material?
[29:06.45]Whatever.
[29:06.71]It's a horse.
[29:12.70]Wait, that was weird.
[29:15.46]Alright, I'm gonna just explore.
[29:16.66]We're just looking.
[29:17.22]I know some people say Breath of the Wild, but...
[29:25.96]I know I'm so stupidly just not interested in Zelda.
[29:29.86]I know.
[29:31.20]But Breath of the Wild, people are saying like, dude, just please, for the love of God, play it if you think this is good.
[29:38.43]Am I going to be one of those people that plays Breath of the Wild eventually after this?
[29:41.53]And is like, yeah, that's like one of the best games ever.
[29:43.73]I don't know why I won't.
[29:50.73]Yes, yes, yes.
[29:51.85]Nah, nah, nah.
[29:56.07]That was like song lyrics.
[29:58.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:06.10]Okay, got another firefly.
[30:07.18]Anything else here?
[30:07.82]There's gotta be like a little dungeon or something.
[30:09.44]There, that's a fucking lobster.
[30:11.76]That is a lobster.
[30:13.75]That's crazy.
[30:14.89]There's a lobster.
[30:16.97]There's always crabs in FromSoftware games, but there's never been a lobster.
[30:23.64]This is freaking me out a little.
[30:25.62]It's weird.
[30:29.90]He's got a lot of health.
[30:33.18]That's crazy.
[30:34.16]Oh my god, he's like a pistol sprint.
[30:37.46]Oh fuck, that hurt.
[30:58.62]Oh!
[30:58.76]I thought he was going to be longer than that.
[31:05.95]He's quick too.
[31:06.59]He's way faster than the crabs.
[31:11.55]I think I got to get off the horse.
[31:13.19]I think I just got to fight him.
[31:18.95]Yep.
[31:19.30]I got to get off the horse.
[31:20.84]We got to go.
[31:32.52]You are fast.
[31:33.22]Lobsters are not this fast.
[31:47.69]I'm out of... I'm out of juice.
[31:50.55]You are as fast as I am on a horse!
[31:52.77]As a fucking lobster!
[31:55.17]Get out of here!
[32:11.56]he's stuck in the ground
[32:32.76]Alright, we're good.
[32:36.23]Damn.
[32:37.93]That was awesome.
[32:39.37]Oh, probably a fresh lobster claw.
[32:42.48]A strip of white flesh.
[32:43.72]Oh, it's actually a lobster.
[32:46.54]Cheese lobster.
[32:54.16]I don't want to have to say this every time I stream this game.
[32:57.48]Sorcery works until it doesn't.
[33:00.56]And when it doesn't work, good luck, because now you've got to fucking use your other weapons, like the claw.
[33:06.40]How many bo- I would- All the naysayers, I'd like to- Let's take a minute here.
[33:11.00]Is this copium?
[33:12.04]Is it, though?
[33:13.60]I have fought five bosses so far.
[33:17.61]How many of them did I use sorcery more than 10% of the time?
[33:23.39]How many bosses have I fought in this game and I used melee only?
[33:26.29]And maybe sorcery, maybe like for one or two seconds.
[33:31.30]Thank you.
[33:34.30]Thank you.
[33:36.72]Thank you.
[33:39.50]Bro, stop ranting every 30 seconds.
[33:41.98]Did you see the title of the stream?
[33:44.58]What is the title of the stream?
[33:54.65]Oh, right, it doesn't say meltdown every 30 seconds.
[33:57.15]Or every 30 minutes, whatever.
[33:57.89]Alright, I need to find a bonfire.
[34:04.65]Get this off.
[34:08.67]Get off the ledge, it's gonna fuck me.
[34:12.66]That was a weird scream.
[34:16.66]That was kind of like a goofy scream.
[34:20.78]Oh, come on, get out of here.
[34:36.29]You're gonna really piss me off if you kill me.
[34:37.85]We're just going.
[34:48.08]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[34:48.68]We can make them fight each other.
[34:51.46]Can we?
[34:51.72]Alright, I'm going in a random direction here.
[35:00.62]I need to take a second.
[35:01.48]Am I still being chased?
[35:02.18]Nice.
[35:03.52]Perfect.
[35:05.93]Somebody behind me?
[35:09.81]Perfect.
[35:10.25]Awesome.
[35:10.67]Alright.
[35:11.55]Let's get our bearings.
[35:12.31]There's the academy.
[35:16.70]And speaking of academies, can we talk about education?
[35:23.44]Uh, so... Purified Ruins.
[35:29.14]Ooh, okay.
[35:29.62]I could probably go down there.
[35:31.71]I'm going that way.
[35:32.39]We're going over here.
[35:32.95]We're going to the ruins.
[35:38.49]It's definitely like a little dungeon or something here.
[35:40.51]Okay, that's...
[36:04.21]Alright, I understand your criticism, right?
[36:05.87]I get, like, you, I, I, I get it.
[36:08.44]I understand, like, the people that are like, like, okay, right here you can complain.
[36:14.08]But don't complain during a boss fight, because you know how it is.
[36:32.71]Okay.
[36:33.27]The ruins are down here.
[36:34.41]Purified ruins.
[36:39.07]Alright, let's get this guy up.
[36:43.20]Where are you?
[36:46.10]Why does it sound like he's behind me?
[36:52.45]Where is he?
[36:52.73]Alright, let's go, dude.
[36:54.65]Come on.
[36:56.85]Come on!
[37:03.86]What was that?
[37:09.65]This thing does crazy great damage.
[37:12.55]This is slow.
[37:20.09]Slow again.
[37:32.52]Too slow again, but I didn't get hit by it.
[37:39.48]I blocked that.
[37:40.14]I don't know how I blocked that.
[37:46.21]Is there the backstab technique?
[37:52.17]Oh, what's the guard one?
[37:53.57]Maybe I should... Should I take a second to figure out how that works?
[37:57.85]There's a different parry in this game, right?
[37:59.50]There's like a guard parry.
[38:00.98]How does that work?
[38:03.65]Yes, there is.
[38:04.49]Okay, so how does it work?
[38:09.71]R2 right after guarding.
[38:14.89]What?
[38:20.43]So they made an easier parry.
[38:22.67]They made a parry that's like an easy parry.
[38:31.05]That that reliable because if that's that reliable then having a shield and being like heavy armor guy Just became like the best way to play this game Let me try that again Okay, that's seriously that's unbelievable what Okay, there's somebody behind
[38:57.90]Why would you ever parry?
[38:59.40]Why would you ever parry?
[39:00.70]Does that work on other... There's no reason to parry in this game.
[39:10.23]At least normal enemies.
[39:11.25]If you have a shield.
[39:14.89]That's ridiculous.
[39:16.04]Does it only... Wait, does it work on like...
[39:38.48]What?
[39:45.56]I can't... I can't believe it.
[39:48.44]That's so much stronger than that.
[39:52.23]Because if you miss this with the few frames that you can hit it, you're just fucked.
[39:59.16]It doesn't always break their stance, though.
[40:05.07]That doesn't work on bosses, though, right?
[40:11.67]There's a huge window for you to be able to do that.
[40:17.51]What's the downside?
[40:18.23]There has to be a downside, right?
[40:20.46]Basic enemies are easy anyways.
[40:21.82]Yeah, that's true.
[40:22.80]I guess that's... You know what?
[40:27.19]If you wanted kind of to block and be able to parry like that... On the kind of normal enemies, I guess that's... It only works really on basic enemies.
[40:35.53]That's... You know, that's cool.
[40:36.65]That's alright.
[40:37.35]Like... Maybe some of the harder enemies you can't do it to.
[40:43.22]Does it take a bunch of stamina?
[40:44.48]I wasn't really paying attention.
[40:47.32]Only good in a few circumstances.
[40:49.44]Alright, well, I mean, now that I know that... Why would I ever try to parry a regular enemy ever again?
[40:55.69]You've seen me do it a bunch of times in the last three days.
[40:59.13]There's no point.
[41:02.01]Fight the lobster?
[41:02.65]I already did.
[41:04.96]This wouldn't be on the map if I couldn't go down somewhere.
[41:11.34]Use it on the lobster.
[41:12.16]You're going to get mocked by everyone if you do it.
[41:21.02]Okay.
[41:21.84]So I only do guard parries and the most OP sorcery move.
[41:28.60]Do I drop to like... Do I drop like 80% viewership?
[41:39.44]I'm not going to do that.
[41:40.22]I'm not going to do that.
[41:41.44]I'm going to use it if I need to.
[41:42.36]Alright.
[41:42.64]So where... I need to find a place to go down.
[41:44.00]This looks promising.
[41:49.14]There's one of these statues here.
[41:52.08]What is this?
[42:02.50]Come on, there's got to be something to do here.
[42:05.67]There's 100 million percent a place to go down.
[42:30.27]What's that?
[42:33.03]Harry the Shrimp, or you're a journalist.
[42:48.04]Come out, one and all, from the darkness underground, and let us offer unto the maiden our eyes.
[42:57.10]He's looking for the underground passage, too.
[43:02.54]It's going to be in a weird spot.
[43:12.87]I didn't check over here yet.
[43:19.15]Runes?
[43:20.97]Heck.
[43:26.36]Tell a joke, funny man.
[43:27.30]The crowd demands it.
[43:30.47]Don't demand things from me.
[43:32.97]Do not demand things from me.
[43:34.56]Okay?
[43:41.80]You can highly suggest things.
[43:45.04]Do not demand things.
[43:54.77]Everyone here is allowed one question per year.
[44:00.09]Which I will or will not answer.
[44:03.86]If any other questions come up during the course of that year... You are using more than your allocated question allowance.
[44:13.30]This is infuriating.
[44:20.22]Where is this cave?
[44:27.99]I'm still technically in the ruins.
[44:29.41]Maybe over here?
[44:32.27]There's got to be a cave.
[44:33.21]I have to find it.
[44:33.95]I can't leave without knowing what's down there.
[44:46.69]Come on.
[44:47.38]Where is it?
[45:06.39]That would kill me, I think.
[45:12.01]God damn it!
[45:12.77]It's right here!
[45:14.25]Come on!
[45:22.30]Here?
[45:22.56]Purified ruins.
[45:32.62]Smashing stone.
[45:33.28]Spitting stone.
[45:36.40]Mmm.
[45:36.68]What are you doing?
[45:37.22]I'm looking for the... Oh!
[45:40.74]Yeah!
[45:43.82]Yep.
[45:44.72]There it is.
[45:45.30]I just had to fall through the ground.
[45:50.16]Hell yeah.
[45:50.56]Let's go.
[45:58.58]Dangerous looking.
[46:01.58]What do I touch first?
[46:02.40]The brewery grape.
[46:06.16]And this is going to be like poisonous.
[46:08.96]Come on.
[46:11.72]Bluefinger's heirloom.
[46:17.71]What's that?
[46:25.73]What is it?
[46:30.61]What is it?
[46:31.57]Is it an item?
[46:39.18]Oh, should I have a golden seed?
[46:40.14]Hell yeah.
[46:40.54]What is it?
[46:44.30]Alright, this is the Glintstone Craftsman Expands Crafting Repertoire.
[47:00.01]There it is.
[47:01.01]Oh, it's a talisman.
[47:03.03]Raises faith.
[47:04.05]Come on!
[47:06.97]Everything I've found so far has been for faith!
[47:09.49]I'm playing the wrong character!
[47:18.58]Shit!
[47:19.36]I keep stumbling upon these ruins and I keep finding items that are awesome and really cool for a different guy!
[47:36.57]Wait, shit, I need that.
[47:37.83]Where is it?
[47:38.25]Are you being serious?
[47:42.50]It's literally here.
[47:46.62]Wait, hold on, dude.
[47:47.34]I need that item.
[47:48.08]Where is it?
[47:49.21]There, let me be your Wikipedia page.
[47:50.83]It's here.
[47:56.61]If you go on the Lunera Highway north, it's south, um, southwest.
[48:02.40]Cheater.
[48:03.64]Oh, come on.
[48:06.10]Some of you guys that haven't started playing this game, are you really trying to tell me that after a week or two, you're not going to go find the item you want to use?
[48:13.46]I want to make a two-handed greatsword, a claymore of the depths build.
[48:18.26]And where is the claymore of the depths?
[48:19.99]I'd like to go get it right now.
[48:22.19]Of course you are.
[48:22.79]Of course you are.
[48:26.64]You might do, like, one or two playthroughs completely blind, right?
[48:31.05]Right?
[48:31.49]But, like, on your second, third, and fourth playthrough, you're definitely gonna, like, just look at where the claymore or the depth is.
[48:47.44]I opened the wiki before I opened the game.
[48:49.26]There's no shame.
[48:50.18]No, there really isn't.
[48:51.00]Alright, there's not.
[48:52.44]If you just want to, like, play the game, there's no shame in that.
[48:58.33]Look, the wiki doesn't make you fight the boss better.
[49:02.13]The wiki just lets you get an item that you know you want.
[49:12.88]Look, I could tell you where that item is, but I'm not guaranteeing your safety getting it.
[49:25.82]Okay, we're almost there.
[49:27.96]Turn around here.
[49:28.94]This way.
[49:30.68]That's our destination.
[49:31.44]It's up there.
[49:33.18]Yes, it is.
[49:38.28]Did you earn it?
[49:41.67]And did you earn it?
[49:42.51]I mean, these games are so particular that if you want to build a, like, faith-based character and have, like, the best, know where, like, the coolest faith-based stuff is, you're either going to stumble upon it like I just did after at least a handful of playthroughs, right?
[49:56.18]Or if it's like, I just want to build a faith character and I want a faith item, where's the nearest faith item?
[50:00.04]Oh, shit.
[50:04.05]These... Oh, shit, the boys are revolting!
[50:11.67]I gotta get my... Where are they?
[50:24.39]Ow!
[50:26.18]Who just did that?
[50:28.88]Oh my god, there's somebody up there with a fucking grenade launcher!
[50:44.62]I'm getting that guy right now.
[50:51.07]Get down, get down, get down, get down.
[50:57.77]They're going to kill you on the left.
[51:19.53]These guys are going to shoot me on the ladder.
[51:20.67]It's going to be awful.
[51:36.36]Watch out for the guy on the top.
[51:37.62]Alright.
[51:38.04]We're good.
[51:42.46]Alright.
[51:42.66]Let's go kill this guy.
[51:46.53]Maybe this is where I'm going to start to see source where we got him.
[51:55.58]oh come on come on staff of the deep sea shit why does this guy have like a dragon fruit beard
[52:46.26]Whoa!
[52:54.00]Is that a mask?
[52:54.92]Or does he actually have two heads?
[52:57.95]We got it!
[53:13.55]Yay!
[53:14.45]Oh, I'm so happy.
[53:15.21]This is fucking awesome.
[53:18.39]Alright.
[53:19.21]Boost Glintblade Sorcery.
[53:22.91]Staff embedded with a blue glintstone, one of two types of carrying staff.
[53:26.36]Gifted to enchanted knights, it enhances Glintblade Sorcery.
[53:29.96]There's no skill to use this?
[53:33.74]Oh, I thought that was making fun of me.
[53:37.39]Oh, by the way, no skill if you use this shit, loser.
[53:40.23]I thought that's what that meant.
[53:48.24]This weapon has no skill.
[53:49.94]No skill.
[53:50.68]You use this shit.
[53:52.90]Okay.
[53:53.36]Alright.
[53:53.66]Let me see.
[53:54.66]That's exciting.
[53:56.50]Because that's intelligence C. Let me see what it looks like.
[53:58.50]I'm going to take a look.
[54:02.27]Ooh.
[54:03.07]Double staff.
[54:11.13]Hell yeah.
[54:16.68]What's the difference?
[54:17.30]So this is... This has been upgraded three times, though.
[54:22.45]So this boosts sorcery.
[54:24.59]This doesn't.
[54:25.69]And this is going to start scaling way better.
[54:27.21]22 intelligence needed.
[54:30.25]I'm just going to take... This is 126, 122.
[54:32.93]For now, just until I go to the blacksmith, we're going to keep using this until I upgrade it.
[54:43.46]That's really exciting.
[54:44.31]I'm really happy.
[54:44.91]Finally, I get like an actual sorcery weapon.
[54:47.83]Oops, wrong hand.
[54:53.55]I gotta get rid of some of this shit.
[54:54.54]I have too many items.
[55:02.02]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[55:03.99]Okay, so that's good.
[55:04.71]No!
[55:10.15]I have too many things in my inventory.
[55:12.12]Alright, for now we're going to keep it because this still has better scaling because it has upgrades.
[55:20.22]What is that?
[55:20.70]What is that down there?
[55:24.02]Just look at me.
[55:24.68]Alright, I'm very happy.
[55:30.96]Let's go.
[55:31.38]I have to go investigate what that is.
[55:41.82]Remember, you promised you'd never make that sound ever again.
[55:44.84]And I made it like four times in a row.
[55:47.70]They were deep, and they were excited.
[55:57.81]Follow the horse and jump off.
[55:59.31]I was kind of scared to do that.
[56:00.25]I figured it was going to hurt me.
[56:01.05]Alright, let me just take one more extra second here.
[56:15.20]There might be something else here.
[56:18.12]Highway, lookout tower.
[56:20.98]Alright.
[56:21.72]I know where this is.
[56:22.52]I'm going to head back.
[56:24.76]I'm going to upgrade the staff.
[56:29.77]He's really just embracing himself today, isn't he?
[56:33.79]Um... I don't know.
[56:36.59]I'm just kind of hanging out.
[56:40.48]Oh, right.
[56:40.86]We're going to upgrade the hell out of this thing.
[57:02.65]You know what else I have that I haven't looked at?
[57:05.63]I have that painting that I could examine.
[57:08.23]Maybe I'll do that too after this one.
[57:14.35]Okay, to the left of the fireplace is where the blacksmith is, otherwise I'll forget it every time.
[57:22.40]Okay, here we go.
[57:24.66]Where is it?
[57:40.50]wrong can I know additional items required I only have one Smithing Stone wait Smithing Stone one I only have one of the one Smithing Stone one Smithing Stone two what's going on Smithing Stone one I think stone three oh I need more of the little ones
[58:09.92]What does that number actually mean?
[58:12.36]Smithing Stone 1.
[58:13.94]Smithing Stone 2.
[58:16.28]Apparently, I have five Smithing Stone 2s, but I have one Smithing Stone 1.
[58:22.06]It's the level of the stone.
[58:26.09]Oh.
[58:28.83]Does he sell them?
[58:31.77]Like, one of them?
[58:32.35]Two of them?
[58:32.93]No.
[58:34.61]Well, that's annoying.
[58:40.48]I'm going to keep this on balance.
[58:42.48]Yeah.
[58:45.00]Okay.
[58:45.58]Well, oh well.
[58:51.70]L all your gear.
[58:52.24]It'll be really funny.
[58:57.45]Oh, we're just going to keep doing what we're doing.
[59:05.11]Different level stones.
[59:09.14]Do I have enough to level up, by the way?
[59:11.27]I might have enough of the crunchies.
[59:13.67]I think I do have enough crunchies to level up.
[59:15.19]Yeah, I definitely do.
[59:20.91]That's about 8,000.
[59:31.47]And I've got to use my flask, see if it's right.
[59:34.39]Thanks for the reminder.
[59:35.15]I would have forgot.
[59:41.20]If I don't get there, I'll be very, very close.
[59:43.00]8,000... What does it take?
[59:49.19]8,200.
[59:50.55]Okay, well, I'll still kill, like, two things.
[60:04.96]Wait, what?
[60:06.28]But I have one.
[60:13.20]I need two now?
[60:14.54]Oh.
[60:15.50]Shit.
[60:16.00]Okay.
[60:19.18]Alright.
[60:19.52]Well.
[60:21.41]Uh, I need to kill like two things.
[60:25.79]What's going on here?
[60:30.99]Oh, they're fighting the ghosts!
[60:35.82]They're having a fight with the ghosts.
[60:43.37]Oh shit.
[60:43.95]Are they going to attack me or am I not priority?
[60:53.01]Holy shit, this is so, this is absolutely free.
[61:04.84]I'm such a fucking bad person.
[61:33.20]Hell yeah.
[61:33.62]I got the souls I needed.
[61:36.98]Just coming in.
[61:38.11]Just unloading.
[61:44.91]I'll take care of this.
[61:57.79]I should have waited.
[61:58.43]I should have waited until everybody was...
[62:02.40]Oh, no.
[62:02.78]They... Oh, no.
[62:05.18]They called their friend.
[62:09.24]Hey.
[62:10.32]Help in the barrens, please.
[62:11.74]There's a level 40 just, like, killing us.
[62:14.70]Oh, alright.
[62:15.02]I'll handle this.
[62:16.02]I'm level 50.
[62:19.32]And then I beat the level 50 as, like, a 42.
[62:23.49]And it's a fucking huge embarrassment.
[62:25.61]The guy logs off.
[62:34.96]What am I doing?
[62:39.87]Oh, I don't have any mana.
[62:44.69]We're gonna go to the bonfire.
[62:50.71]Where's the fire?
[62:51.31]Where is it?
[62:55.01]Oh man, he's got magic.
[62:57.54]Okay.
[62:58.36]He's got magic.
[62:59.98]Where's the fire?
[63:00.58]Where's the bonfire?
[63:05.52]Where is the fire?
[63:06.44]I don't even remember where it is.
[63:10.37]Person here.
[63:12.61]Ah, the puppets.
[63:13.47]The puppets besiege us.
[63:22.36]There it is.
[63:28.85]Alright, so now I'm not going to mess that up again.
[63:30.65]I'm going to maybe get health to 18.
[63:35.20]Or dexterity 22.
[63:39.66]HP probably.
[63:41.18]Or mind.
[63:42.16]What does it get to?
[63:44.66]God.
[63:45.14]To get to 100, it's going to be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20.
[63:47.55]It's going to be 7 fucking levels.
[63:50.19]Before I can use that guy.
[64:03.36]You're talking about, like, 60 plus thousand souls.
[64:13.16]All just to summon Oleg.
[64:14.70]You reach 100 mana at 20.
[64:23.46]This is gonna... I'm gonna be so under... My character's gonna be so underdeveloped.
[64:34.42]And I'm going to summon this guy, and he's going to... Okay, we're going to do this.
[64:36.54]I'm going to spend the next, like, 70,000 souls on Mind.
[64:40.82]And Oleg is going to get one hit killed by the next fucking single enemy.
[64:45.77]It's going to be such a disaster.
[64:47.91]And it'll be your fault.
[64:50.33]And mine.
[64:50.67]50-50.
[64:51.95]We'll split it.
[64:57.60]Okay, let's try this again.
[64:59.14]It's definitely not magic for that guy because he's a magic.
[65:01.62]He's made out of the goo that I shoot out of my staff.
[65:06.19]So there's no way it's magic.
[65:07.65]So we have to just kill him with our special moves.
[65:10.95]I think I'm going to have to get the boys involved.
[65:22.48]Let's just go aggro him.
[65:24.68]Because then there'll be a bunch of people here.
[65:26.71]It'll be an absolute mess.
[65:30.53]Okay, it's going to be a mess.
[65:31.95]Here we go.
[65:42.78]Fight the big guy that's about to come over here.
[65:44.40]Dude, do you not see what's over there?
[65:49.70]Look behind you.
[65:53.29]Why would you come after me?
[65:54.41]There's a guy right there.
[65:57.43]He's killing everyone.
[65:58.45]Alright, just follow me.
[65:59.25]I'm just getting on the horse.
[66:02.31]Alright, come on.
[66:06.45]Let's go.
[66:06.81]Is he fighting the other ghosts?
[66:14.86]He's got a lot of health.
[66:20.64]What just happened?
[66:21.10]Did he just bump into something?
[66:21.96]What's wrong with him?
[66:29.50]He just tripped.
[66:31.22]Oh my god, that was embarrassing.
[66:33.84]That was really embarrassing.
[66:37.44]What happened?
[66:52.06]Somebody is parrying him.
[66:55.34]One of them keeps parrying him.
[67:00.90]No, he's not running into the wall.
[67:03.37]One of these guys is parrying his attack.
[67:06.99]It's this guy.
[67:07.47]It's this knight with the shield.
[67:12.23]Yeah, he's like... Come on, do it again.
[67:20.40]And then I'm going to sneak over there and just hit him in the face.
[67:26.93]It's definitely a parry.
[67:28.13]It's absolutely a parry.
[67:34.34]No, don't kill him.
[67:35.30]He's actually very useful.
[67:36.36]Block it!
[67:40.72]Parry!
[67:43.10]Boys!
[67:46.49]Let's go!
[67:58.08]No!
[68:07.87]Holy shit.
[68:22.09]Parry.
[68:23.63]Come on, parry him, dude.
[68:24.59]Please, parry him.
[68:28.24]Harry!
[68:35.67]Harry!
[68:40.21]Almost.
[68:43.70]Fuck, he didn't parry him.
[69:04.46]I had no stamina.
[69:19.54]Fuck, I thought he was done with his moves.
[69:44.16]Dude, why did he get off the fucking horse?
[69:47.56]This... Left stick is bound to crouch, which is a horse.
[69:55.89]Left stick just... Why is there... Just take the crouch out of the game.
[70:02.25]It's fucking left stick.
[70:03.87]The eye pressed left stick accidentally.
[70:08.44]This, so, come on, dude.
[70:10.52]What the fuck?
[70:13.30]Do I really have to unbind this shit every time I start the game?
[70:16.49]What a pain in the ass. ...
[70:35.76]I'm not the only one that's saying this.
[70:37.54]I'm not the only one!
[70:38.48]Oh my... Okay, let's go.
[70:53.43]Stupid-ass bullshit.
[70:56.95]I had it too.
[71:01.19]This is dumb.
[71:11.41]Alright, bring him over here.
[71:16.43]Oh, I have an easy solution.
[71:19.34]I have an easy solution to the problem.
[71:21.36]Have crouch be you hold the button for more than one second.
[71:25.66]Like, hold, like, okay, crouch, right?
[71:27.80]Like, that's so easy.
[71:28.78]Just make it a hold.
[71:29.66]Make it you hold it for like half a second.
[71:40.70]Alright, get him.
[71:51.14]You'd accidentally press it?
[71:52.02]Yeah, but you wouldn't hold it.
[71:53.38]You'd tap it and it wouldn't do anything.
[72:14.54]Go!
[72:59.05]Oh my god, he killed me in one fucking hit.
[73:00.92]I thought he was done with his moves.
[73:03.00]I thought he only does one and then two.
[73:04.44]He does three.
[73:06.84]He does a third.
[73:07.70]This lumbering fuck.
[73:26.12]First of all.
[73:28.88]I'm not going to be doing magic on him, so.
[73:30.86]Let's take care of that first of all.
[73:41.53]He jumped into the sword.
[73:42.39]Well, I jumped into the sword because I didn't know he was doing a third attack.
[74:00.58]Alright, spawn this idiot.
[74:03.96]What was that?
[74:07.06]Okay, let's go.
[74:08.36]No more bullshit.
[74:11.28]Do the strategy.
[74:24.90]Did he just kill everybody already?
[74:26.24]There's so many people to... Okay, this is going to be a huge problem.
[74:34.20]There's so many people to target, to lock onto, that it's hard to actually get my targeter on him.
[74:50.87]Carry him!
[74:52.19]Carry him!
[74:59.89]God, I'm nice.
[75:04.88]I'm just a seagull at the beach.
[75:07.14]Oh, any food?
[75:10.08]Any scraps?
[75:31.50]I'm just a vulture.
[75:32.54]Where are my souls?
[75:35.44]I did the same mistake.
[75:47.38]I thought he was gonna... Okay, here he comes.
[76:00.18]Good job, guys!
[76:10.69]Go get him!
[76:18.87]Let's go!
[76:43.52]Do not get hit by one of those.
[76:45.08]I'm stuck in a rock.
[77:03.74]I'm on a rock.
[77:04.42]I'm on a rock.
[77:29.37]That boy right there doesn't even know where he is.
[77:33.05]That's just Torch Boy.
[77:45.52]Get out of here.
[77:46.20]Okay.
[77:49.17]We did it.
[77:50.59]You and me.
[78:01.07]The one survivor.
[78:03.39]Alright, so what were you protecting down here?
[78:09.07]He logged out.
[78:11.76]Obviously, whatever you're protecting in here, there's a reason why you're doing it.
[78:14.93]What is it?
[78:15.21]It's the main road?
[78:15.99]We're still dark.
[78:18.31]Let me take a quick look.
[78:28.87]Kind of scary.
[78:46.22]There's definitely gonna be a bonfire right here.
[78:48.36]Right?
[78:54.72]Where are we?
[79:03.09]Raya Lucaria.
[79:05.19]Hallowed hall dedicated to the study of magic.
[79:07.25]Why shut your doors to me?
[79:08.91]Am I barred from donning the crown of stone?
[79:14.73]Oh, we're here.
[79:15.23]This is it.
[79:23.08]This is it.
[79:25.64]Yup.
[79:28.41]This is the castle of magic.
[79:29.53]It's right here.
[79:31.93]I could explore, but not yet.
[79:33.11]I need to get the bonfire so I don't have to fight that big giant guy again.
[79:52.25]Oh, is this place like abandoned?
[80:07.07]I know.
[80:09.79]I just walked off the edge, but that doesn't matter.
[80:26.72]Okay, there's... ...somebody in... ...what appears to be a... ...hot air balloon.
[80:50.83]What the fuck?
[80:54.96]Fuck!
[81:04.06]I don't lock on.
[81:04.82]It's harder.
[81:10.12]Uh-oh.
[81:10.68]Uh-oh.
[81:12.31]I'm dead.
[81:14.03]Oh, that's 5,000 souls.
[81:23.07]Just got R1 spammed.
[81:29.84]That's so... Wow, that's so pretty.
[81:32.08]Where's the big tree?
[81:37.63]I'm so close to the castle.
[81:39.37]Looks like a painting.
[81:54.26]Luigi's gonna have to take over?
[81:55.32]Well, I don't think so.
[81:58.54]I think I should be fine.
[82:17.18]Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[82:20.80]Alright, give me the souls before I die again.
[82:24.96]Alright, so what is, what the hell is this thing?
[82:26.38]I just destroy this?
[82:33.04]Golden Rune.
[82:34.38]A plus six Golden Rune?
[82:35.86]Holy shit.
[82:40.87]I don't know which way I should go.
[82:41.97]There's so many ways to go.
[82:43.41]Who are these little guys?
[83:13.17]What was that?
[83:13.89]Is that thing alive?
[83:14.67]Is that thing alive?
[83:17.35]That thing's alive!
[83:18.13]Holy shit, they're aiming at me!
[83:27.54]This guy's face looks like half of every Twitch emote I've ever seen.
[83:30.90]It's like a zoomed in face.
[83:41.44]That was cool.
[83:52.38]I think I kind of have to take care of this thing, right?
[84:03.15]That's the only amount of damage I'm doing to this?
[84:09.01]I don't think I can really reliably kill that.
[84:15.40]This is going to take a long time.
[84:16.43]You're killing us.
[84:24.93]You're killing us.
[84:25.49]What?
[84:28.98]You're killing us.
[84:30.64]What?
[84:37.62]Alright, now I definitely can't get in there.
[84:38.82]I wonder if they drop anything.
[84:50.15]Maybe you're really not supposed to... Maybe you're not supposed to fight it.
[84:53.91]I don't know.
[84:55.21]I think that's just kind of an annoying thing that's here.
[84:59.95]There's a bunch of them too.
[85:06.49]Yeah.
[85:06.89]They're just scattered around.
[85:07.96]Alright, so... I'm going to keep going this way.
[85:11.42]I'm going to explore over here from the academy gate town.
[85:14.50]Is that the academy right there?
[85:20.00]No.
[85:21.88]The Academy's over here.
[85:36.47]Lucerne.
[85:44.36]It's a dex weapon.
[85:48.09]Scales mostly with Dex.
[85:50.29]I need 15 strength though.
[85:51.01]Alright, I'm going to go this way because I'm just going to explore over here for a minute.
[86:04.40]Alright, there's like these little weirdo guys.
[86:12.97]Alright, I'm going to go over here.
[86:21.10]I think it's firing the missiles at me right now.
[86:31.51]Thankfully, there's not that much tracking on it.
[86:34.71]Alright, what's over here?
[86:37.87]A little hut?
[86:55.50]What do you got here?
[87:08.21]What is going on with chat?
[87:10.63]I don't know.
[87:14.33]I gotta look at the new armor that I have, too.
[87:16.73]Silver Pickled Foulfoot.
[87:19.49]Okay.
[87:24.55]I'm going to keep just going around the perimeter.
[87:25.65]And then when I get too far, I'm going to teleport back.
[87:31.76]And level up again.
[87:33.34]Because I don't want to die here.
[87:39.65]Garnished golden sunflower.
[87:41.01]Ooh.
[88:06.72]Still alive, no?
[88:17.47]What's this pot?
[88:18.75]Why are you guys spamming pot?
[88:20.29]Is that like a he doesn't know, here comes like the big pot enemy?
[88:26.26]That's what that is.
[88:26.78]Yeah.
[88:33.32]Yeah, here comes the... Oh, he doesn't... No, shh.
[88:35.02]Don't tell him.
[88:35.52]Here comes, like, the pickled butt.
[88:38.50]There's gonna be, like, pickled bird feathers or something.
[88:41.92]Whatever it is.
[88:43.62]It comes out of its pot and it does, like, poison damage.
[88:54.78]Because you smoke pot.
[88:56.06]I don't smoke pot.
[88:59.18]Slander!
[89:07.56]So I'm definitely back here.
[89:36.39]so so
[89:54.70]Ooh, I got them all.
[89:55.70]I'm out of mana.
[90:01.88]Landsquirt Ashes?
[90:03.60]Ooh, that's a new war thing.
[90:07.08]Ash of Orbiters.
[90:13.45]I wanted to kill all these.
[90:14.25]Those are new friends?
[90:18.25]Really?
[90:18.55]Okay.
[90:24.99]Oh, there's no mana.
[90:25.85]Sorry.
[90:35.58]There might be something else here.
[90:38.12]I don't care.
[90:44.81]Never mind.
[90:46.11]I lost interest.
[90:53.97]What's this pot emote?
[90:54.95]It's gonna be like the boss or something, right?
[90:56.91]I'm gonna walk over here and a giant pot's gonna land.
[90:59.21]Is it up here?
[91:07.12]Nothing?
[91:08.16]I feel like FromSoftware would put something weird up here, right?
[91:33.14]Oh, it's just cool looking rock.
[91:42.48]More perimeter checking.
[91:43.58]I'm just checking the perimeter.
[91:44.62]I'm just going around the edge.
[91:45.72]Just seeing if there's anything here.
[91:46.92]Any caves?
[91:48.36]Any interesting structures?
[92:04.21]Okay, there's a new bonfire here.
[92:07.07]All the way in the edge of this perimeter.
[92:10.48]Down here.
[92:18.36]Okay, I'm going to go here in a second, but not right now because there's so many wolves.
[92:26.13]You guys are going to get that emote banned?
[92:35.31]Same.
[92:40.57]Let's take these both.
[92:45.67]These are probably... 3,000?
[92:46.13]4,000.
[92:46.41]Hell yeah.
[92:48.59]Alright, so that... I might have enough to do it twice.
[92:54.71]Oh, not really.
[92:57.01]Oh, this is... I'm going to be so far behind.
[92:59.38]I'm going to be... What else does mine do?
[93:04.02]What does mine do?
[93:09.01]It determines FP and affects focus.
[93:12.94]What does focus do?
[93:13.88]The resistance to sleep and bouts of madness.
[93:23.66]So if I... There's going to be one boss in this game that's a sleep boss and it's going to be the one that I can actually handle.
[93:48.23]I don't know.
[93:49.47]I feel like I kind of need to level up this after I beat a boss and get like 30,000, 40,000 souls.
[94:02.26]Imagine the amount of damage I'm not going to be doing to bosses and enemies though, because I want to have 20 mind.
[94:08.36]I think it has to be dex or intelligence.
[94:15.81]At some point, as the game starts to snowball in its difficulty, I can't be like 20 in every stat, Andy.
[94:32.46]Do intelligence.
[94:41.27]I actually might... Let me just go over here.
[94:43.81]There's like a wolf down over here.
[95:02.63]Don't howl, just come at me and attack me.
[95:11.79]Got a lot of health.
[95:34.71]I don't want to fight any of you.
[95:36.17]I just want to come over and see if there's any jewels behind that rock.
[95:59.15]We back.
[96:00.03]What's the f- We're gonna figure out what it is and I'm gonna know what it is in like a minute.
[96:08.39]I don't want to fight you.
[96:09.95]Okay.
[96:22.08]We're guarding something over here.
[96:23.75]What was it?
[96:26.91]They didn't attack in the pack.
[96:28.05]I don't know.
[96:28.91]There's a bunch.
[96:29.55]I just want to get through.
[96:30.83]I don't want to go kill all these wolves for no reason.
[96:36.72]Anything over here?
[96:42.49]This is another area.
[96:51.05]Holy shit.
[96:59.67]Okay, this is... This game is way bigger than I thought it was.
[97:06.50]I thought it was like this here.
[97:12.03]This game is huge.
[97:17.97]It's huge.
[97:19.47]Alright, we gotta go back.
[97:20.43]It becomes weeks of Elden Ring.
[97:32.10]Um... I don't know how I'm gonna handle this, I wonder.
[97:38.58]Because the game is so massive and there's so much going on.
[97:43.60]I don't think I have to play through the entire game in the first six or seven days it comes out.
[97:55.33]If this truly is a hundred plus hour experience, I...
[98:12.54]Alright, what's this?
[98:13.88]Can I get in here?
[98:19.74]What you just saw is less than half of the full map.
[98:23.64]How did they make this game?
[98:26.17]How did they do this?
[98:27.21]This doesn't make any sense.
[98:29.41]This is impossible.
[98:35.89]This is half the map?
[98:50.77]Less than half.
[98:53.44]What are you talking about?
[98:56.28]I don't bel- I can't bel- I don't believe it.
[99:04.99]What you're ta- what you're saying seems almost impossible.
[99:11.07]What is this thing?
[99:16.40]Here it comes, guys.
[99:17.08]Here comes the pot.
[99:18.38]Right?
[99:18.72]Big open area where nothing is here.
[99:20.92]Pot's gonna land.
[99:21.90]And he's gonna put his hand out like... No, it's just a couple of lobsters.
[99:45.82]What do these lights mean?
[99:46.74]Is it just cool looking or does it actually mean anything?
[100:23.56]Where did it go?
[100:24.16]What?
[100:29.12]That's not it.
[100:29.70]That's not the pot.
[100:30.64]Okay.
[100:31.42]Well, I don't know where it is.
[100:38.05]You guys, it's going to fall on me.
[100:39.97]And it's going to be so anticlimactic now.
[100:42.17]Because of your emote spam.
[100:44.19]Okay?
[100:44.37]Okay.
[101:03.59]Oil Prawn shack?
[101:21.06]This is... Okay, cool.
[101:22.14]Who's this?
[101:25.76]He's just boiling a bunch of prawns?
[101:39.82]What's going on?
[101:40.20]Just kill him?
[101:47.71]Hmm.
[102:13.99]So, the prawn NPC is, uh, doesn't like me.
[102:19.26]Maybe I can show up later with something?
[102:54.34]Okay.
[102:54.74]Prawn guy says piss off to me.
[102:56.30]He's at Prawn Shack in Swamp Before Academy.
[103:07.48]Okay.
[103:09.96]So what's the point of the bonfire being here?
[103:12.34]Okay.
[103:34.16]Okay, this goes this way.
[103:37.14]Yeah, that's the academy.
[103:37.96]I'm kind of going the right way, but why would there be a bonfire right there?
[103:46.58]These are alive.
[103:47.22]This area is so weird.
[103:56.36]I hate it.
[103:58.34]But I love it.
[103:59.42]I hate this.
[104:01.89]It's so fucking weird.
[104:04.23]So unsettling.
[104:07.41]Okay, I think I can upgrade staff now.
[104:12.85]So unsettling to me.
[104:15.75]Lobsters and shit.
[104:16.81]The huge lobsters.
[104:19.25]Crabs don't really do that to me, but these big lobsters do.
[104:21.40]Okay.
[104:38.97]What about over here?
[104:48.26]Weird little place to go through here.
[104:49.58]Alright, I see something.
[104:57.60]Oh.
[104:57.74]Okay.
[105:05.19]Another one of these.
[105:07.43]They've been so much better about putting these in places.
[105:11.13]They're kind of everywhere.
[105:21.22]They're everywhere.
[105:23.92]And the fact that you can just fast travel to any of them is really actually awesome.
[105:36.95]Alright, more of these crystals.
[105:40.17]Maybe I can get some more of these fireflies.
[105:41.75]Yeah.
[105:49.04]This reminds me of Fraggled Rock.
[105:50.12]I like it.
[105:50.46]There's something about shining light.
[105:57.58]Light coming through crystals like this.
[106:03.66]I just want to eat these.
[106:04.78]I know what they taste like.
[106:07.32]It's like blue raspberry.
[106:08.72]Little crab.
[106:24.10]There's a lot of this shit over here.
[106:25.16]There's a huge one.
[106:46.42]Whoa, okay.
[106:47.70]Um... Who's this person?
[106:59.60]That person's hiding.
[107:08.34]What the fuck?
[107:09.82]Are they not gonna stop?
[107:17.69]Three damage?
[107:24.60]Seven damage.
[107:28.96]I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
[107:38.40]Unless there's some other way to fight those guys.
[107:40.16]Three damage.
[107:42.88]Three damage on a swing.
[107:44.22]Seven damage on sorcery.
[107:48.64]I want to get a better view.
[108:09.41]But what is the purpose of that?
[108:10.99]Why is that here?
[108:16.84]That's such a weird thing to be... That's such a weird thing.
[108:22.74]Right?
[108:22.98]That's... This is weird.
[108:24.20]Why is this here?
[108:26.70]Two really, really strong enemies that have a ton of health and a ton of defense.
[108:31.27]What are they... What's the guard?
[108:32.13]What are they guarding?
[108:32.81]Something here.
[108:36.99]Oops.
[108:37.59]We need that.
[108:46.40]I don't know.
[108:46.70]Maybe I'll find out later.
[108:52.86]Nice.
[109:00.52]Jesus.
[109:04.34]Jesus.
[109:04.92]Where am I going?
[109:07.05]Jeez.
[109:07.65]Okay.
[109:08.05]Up here?
[109:10.84]I don't know what to do.
[109:12.16]This is ridiculous.
[109:14.86]I don't know what to say.
[109:16.04]Where do I go?
[109:16.68]I'm going to go over here.
[109:18.02]I know I'm not supposed to be here, but I just want to... What about the... There was a bear.
[109:24.05]Wasn't there like a bear looking at me?
[109:26.15]Where was that?
[109:26.61]I want to go look at that.
[109:27.71]I forget where that was.
[109:31.55]It was near like the watchtower.
[109:32.71]Let me see.
[109:41.02]Let me just check a little bit more over here.
[109:42.36]I'm going to check.
[109:43.86]This is a weird building.
[109:44.74]I'm going to go in there.
[109:49.80]Wait.
[109:50.26]I want to look over here first.
[109:54.12]This is not poison, right?
[110:03.10]Items.
[110:11.97]Here we go.
[110:12.37]Nice.
[110:14.93]I think stones.
[110:15.49]I need these bats.
[110:16.46]I'm glad I'm finding them.
[110:20.58]Bat's getting angry because he's exploring an open world game.
[110:25.03]Well, okay, here's the thing.
[110:27.47]It's not just an open world game.
[110:30.07]It's a FromSoftware open world game.
[110:33.40]That means very different things.
[110:36.26]If I was walking around, turning on every little, like, watchtower thing in an Ubisoft game, then yeah, I'd be like, alright dude, what are you doing?
[110:45.70]This is very different.
[110:46.88]Because you can find some pretty crazy shit if you go kind of off the path.
[110:52.75]As we've been at least proven at least a few times.
[110:56.17]So if I was walking around picking up like crafting materials and dying light too.
[110:59.27]It'd be like, alright, like dude, this is, what are you doing?
[111:02.96]Like we're not going to find a dungeon to go down and have like an insane encounter.
[111:15.44]One of the trap chests just sent me to the final area of the game.
[111:20.91]Fuck.
[111:25.00]I'm just scouting.
[111:25.96]That's all this is.
[111:26.72]There.
[111:36.58]And this is why you scout.
[111:38.06]This is why you scout.
[111:41.46]This is going to be an item.
[111:42.32]It's going to be a weapon or something.
[111:44.08]And that's why it's a faith weapon.
[111:45.90]Never mind.
[111:46.38]Fuck this game.
[111:52.85]Go back here.
[112:05.51]Okay, back here.
[112:06.41]This is the statue.
[112:07.57]This is where I was.
[112:11.10]Alright, so let me take a look.
[112:14.98]This is where the academy is.
[112:17.00]That's where I want to go.
[112:21.33]So I think the play is go on the road.
[112:24.63]Go straight on the road and head towards the academy.
[112:28.43]You don't have to justify playing the game how you want to play it.
[112:34.93]Okay, look, I can understand.
[112:35.97]Here's the thing.
[112:36.93]I can understand if you want to watch a stream where it's like, alright, he's going to go kill the shit, and it's going to be a big intense fight, and he's going to kill everything.
[112:46.04]Yeah, I know.
[112:46.48]I mean, the parts of these games where you're just kind of like, ooh, a tree.
[112:52.12]Ooh, the sun coming through the tree.
[112:54.44]What's over here?
[112:56.90]Oh, there are weeds here.
[112:58.78]There are weeds here.
[113:00.77]Yeah, it's like, alright, dude.
[113:02.89]Fight somebody.
[113:04.65]I get it, right?
[113:06.11]But, I mean, remember, this is everybody's first time experiencing this stuff, right?
[113:11.77]Obviously, I don't want to sort of run to the next encounter as fast as I can.
[113:19.86]But I am heading towards the main objective.
[113:32.68]What are these crystals?
[113:33.48]They're gonna have some kind of significance.
[113:47.07]Is that... Okay, I will be really impressed if this actually is in just game space and that is just there.
[114:00.87]Is that just kind of a background image, or is that actually just rendered there and it's there, it's been there the whole time?
[114:06.14]Because we've seen that from very far away, and it just was kind of like a painting, but that's just there?
[114:30.50]Alright, finally I can upgrade my flask.
[114:40.03]Stop!
[114:43.49]Looks like Isaac.
[114:50.77]Alright, there's one of those statues.
[114:55.08]Why is that here?
[115:05.40]It does work so much better
[115:37.08]So I'm on the boys?
[115:37.76]Nah, I don't need them right now.
[115:47.09]I don't need the boys right now.
[115:49.45]Who's he aiming at?
[115:50.03]Oh my god, that's a gun!
[115:53.63]That's a gun.
[115:53.97]Can I break this so nobody can use it?
[116:13.50]Is he just eating?
[116:19.63]What are they eating?
[116:28.83]Just checking, okay.
[116:30.65]Uh, this is a bad guy up here.
[116:34.43]That guy looks important.
[116:36.21]So...
[116:56.43]Alright, here he comes.
[117:04.67]Not quite yet.
[117:07.13]This is the VI- This is the guy.
[117:08.27]He's waiting for me to get to the top.
[117:19.51]He looks dangerous, doesn't he?
[117:20.75]Let's go.
[117:40.24]I get that guy way... That wasn't a big deal.
[117:54.16]Let's hug the outside edge here.
[117:55.48]Is this a main bridge?
[118:05.78]NPC right there.
[118:08.70]I think that's an NPC.
[118:21.76]Wait, is that a lady?
[118:25.27]Please, I can't read them.
[118:29.53]Your fingers, please, your fingers.
[118:35.46]Oh, bless you.
[118:42.66]What, what, the, what?
[118:45.97]Michaela's favor can be yours.
[118:49.19]Michaela's favor.
[119:01.92]I gotta clean these notes up.
[119:10.09]Some of them are not accurate anymore.
[119:11.27]Because we already did them.
[119:12.07]Snatch it from the big pot.
[119:19.04]Mm-hmm.
[119:30.85]Did she say where it was?
[119:31.59]Did she say where it was?
[119:37.45]Miquella's favor can be yours.
[119:41.25]Slaughter, slaughter.
[119:42.19]The all-hearing slaughter.
[119:44.62]All you need to do is snatch it from the pot.
[119:46.94]She didn't say where it is.
[119:49.98]Where's the pot?
[119:51.72]Where's the big pot, then?
[119:52.66]She didn't tell me where it was.
[120:04.70]It just said, ooh, slaughter.
[120:06.20]Pity.
[120:06.72]I pity you for slaughtering the pot.
[120:09.06]It's in the pot.
[120:11.30]Don't tell me where it is, though.
[120:18.31]It just exists somewhere.
[120:20.09]Okay, let's hide.
[120:35.51]Is that it?
[120:36.01]That's a unit from Warhammer.
[120:48.28]That's like Warhammer 40k.
[120:49.96]That's an Ork-mobile.
[121:06.70]Is that a guy right there?
[121:34.86]They're gonna see me do this.
[121:45.60]What?
[121:57.07]It's got a face?
[122:06.11]I can't hurt this thing.
[122:08.02]Okay, never mind.
[122:08.86]Can I hit it in the head?
[122:14.53]Get the boys out here, please!
[122:16.49]What am I supposed to do about this thing?
[122:33.15]Jump on its head?
[122:47.32]I don't think so.
[122:54.76]There's a guy right here.
[123:15.50]God damn, sick plane jump rope.
[123:17.16]Alright, die.
[123:17.90]Can I get in this?
[123:24.54]Fire blossom.
[123:27.90]Very cool.
[123:28.48]Alright, let's take a look.
[123:41.28]That was pretty cool.
[123:44.99]You should go get Updug.
[123:46.03]What's Updug?
[123:56.27]They're aiming over here.
[123:57.11]I'm gonna go around.
[124:14.88]I'm gonna do this very, very carefully, because I think there's a couple people back here, too.
[124:18.62]Yeah, there is.
[124:19.56]So, one by one, I'm gonna get these guys from... I'm gonna get them from behind.
[124:22.72]Nobody else is here.
[124:26.68]Sneaking through.
[124:29.10]Wow.
[124:29.56]Okay, let's do it.
[124:36.38]Why was that on a backstep?
[124:38.76]What the fuck?
[124:40.14]Why?
[124:40.46]That was... That was clearly right there.
[124:58.71]That seriously is such a game-changing thing that you can do.
[125:03.85]Cool brass shield.
[125:09.32]Make sure you're not holding forward.
[125:10.36]Yeah, I thought I was at a complete stop.
[125:12.60]Alright, I'm at a complete stop right here.
[125:17.72]Can I not be crouching?
[125:23.10]Maybe the guys that are... Oh, if you're holding on to something, maybe you can do it.
[125:26.44]Okay.
[125:35.27]I have a Talisman that buffs those counters.
[125:38.51]I actually think I do.
[125:39.93]Yeah, you're right.
[125:40.39]It might be worth putting on.
[125:55.81]Probably animation locked, yeah.
[125:57.54]That makes sense.
[125:59.72]Blue, white, wooden shield.
[126:01.00]Alright, let me... I got some new stuff.
[126:05.80]This is... Okay, blue, white, wooden shield.
[126:14.07]Small wooden round shield that has been reinforced with metal.
[126:16.31]It is light and easy to handle, but cannot offer the damage negation of a true metal shield.
[126:19.93]Alright, this thing's kind of junk.
[126:24.67]This is junk.
[126:30.58]Brass shield, although this is better.
[126:32.26]Oh, I can't hold it.
[126:32.94]I don't have enough strength.
[126:37.51]Wooden grade shield, I can't hold it.
[126:44.29]This thing has more magic.
[126:45.97]But, I mean, this thing is still good.
[126:47.31]100%.
[126:47.33]Oh, this is blood loss build up.
[126:52.04]50.
[126:52.48]Maybe I should have that on.
[127:03.50]Is that good?
[127:07.46]This one's still better.
[127:09.03]Wait, I got some more gear.
[127:10.17]Okay, let me look at these.
[127:13.91]I'm in like magic town, right?
[127:15.57]So I'm probably going to need to have magic resistance.
[127:19.69]What has magic resistance?
[127:20.69]This does.
[127:21.11]10, 11, 12.
[127:22.83]Alright, let's see.
[127:27.17]This one or this one?
[127:30.52]I don't like how that's not...
[127:33.75]I think this is the one.
[127:38.03]This one.
[127:41.56]Looking for magic resistance, which this has it.
[127:43.80]0.7, 2.7.
[127:46.18]This one's fine.
[127:47.08]With these.
[127:47.60]Alright, magic 6.8.
[127:48.26]These are just better.
[128:00.40]I'm going to put these on because this is just kind of better and you lose a little bit of magic, but it's still pretty good.
[128:08.52]If you want specific directions to the pot, chat has them, but it's up to you.
[128:12.38]Hmm.
[128:16.21]Let me wander around for another like 10 to 20 minutes.
[128:20.01]And we'll see.
[128:37.25]Follow your nose.
[128:46.46]I think that does it for here.
[128:49.90]The gate.
[128:50.48]There's the front gate.
[128:59.11]There is a bonfire here as well.
[129:00.49]I have a lot of souls.
[129:09.12]Front door to the academy.
[129:11.75]Pretty cool.
[129:12.13]Alright, I'm going to level up.
[129:21.75]This.
[129:24.07]Finally have a new charge.
[129:25.35]And that's five and two is fine.
[129:32.28]I want to look at those new ashes though.
[129:41.48]Let's go this way.
[129:46.90]Think I'll have enough.
[129:50.23]It's gonna be close.
[129:56.21]What do I need, 9,000?
[129:56.73]Gonna be close.
[130:00.21]Alright, should I just have chat tell me where it is so I don't have to look over here and see this goddamn emote?
[130:23.60]Okay, let's check this first.
[130:24.70]This looks like it's blocked.
[130:30.24]Meeting place map.
[130:32.27]Found a simple map.
[130:33.41]Check your inventory.
[130:36.31]What would it be?
[130:52.13]simple map found on a corpse seems to point to a meeting place man it came from surely desired one the sole means of gaining entry into the academy a glint stone key bro where is that it's in the water somewhere I can't go in here without a glint stone key shit
[131:22.19]Alright.
[131:23.37]I need to find where that is.
[131:25.91]It looks like it's in a lake or in some water.
[131:27.59]I don't have a map of this area.
[131:31.47]Shit.
[131:39.40]Wait, let me look at the other thing too.
[131:40.92]That painting.
[131:47.06]Note sold by nomadic merchant imparting knowledge.
[131:49.82]Someone lurks among the Waypoint Ruins on the roads through Limgrave.
[131:56.99]Work of a wandering artist, reminiscence of a painting titled Prophecy.
[132:03.19]Painter is said to have captured the landscapes seen during the last moments of those welcomed to the death's embrace.
[132:09.81]So the painter and the vestiges of the dead's last moments can be discovered by visiting the location depicted.
[132:31.79]What just ran by the screen?
[132:37.07]Did you see that?
[132:42.37]That wasn't a player's soul.
[132:43.38]I'm not online.
[132:44.12]I'm not online.
[132:51.90]I'm offline.
[132:53.79]Something just, like, went by the screen.
[133:03.08]Oh, man.
[133:03.66]There's so much stuff.
[133:07.32]You could spend an eternity.
[133:09.60]This is like a single-player MMO.
[133:13.32]Okay.
[133:13.98]I don't have the map, and I don't have the key.
[133:16.61]But I at least have the spawn point right there.
[133:20.39]I have the...
[133:22.39]Lucaria Gate.
[133:25.71]Which... Okay, that's how to get in.
[133:27.17]I need the key.
[133:27.89]But I don't know where the key is.
[133:29.21]Because I need to find where the key is.
[133:30.97]The key is on a map.
[133:31.99]But I don't have the map of the area.
[133:33.41]I'm going to find the map of this area.
[133:42.10]Interesting stuff.
[133:43.60]So... I'm going to take a guess.
[133:48.56]That... The Academy Gate Town...
[133:52.14]Would have a map of the academy gate.
[133:54.54]I'm just going to guess.
[133:56.45]That's where I'm going to go.
[134:01.97]It was raindrops, really.
[134:06.47]I feel like there's probably a little town here that probably has a map.
[134:11.20]Let's see if I can find it.
[134:23.76]I don't think I, like, really explored this area here.
[134:26.02]Because it's on the map for a reason, right?
[134:31.76]They wouldn't just put this here.
[134:33.88]The marker on the map.
[134:52.14]What's that?
[134:52.50]Is that an enemy?
[134:55.05]That's an NPC.
[134:58.84]Oh, it's this guy.
[135:01.54]I remember this guy.
[135:08.92]Hello, friend.
[135:10.04]Tell me if you know, would you?
[135:11.86]The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.
[135:15.48]The recusants who hunt their fellow tarnished.
[135:18.32]They laid hands upon my servant, Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand.
[135:23.43]The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.
[135:26.47]The house here.
[135:27.31]I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.
[135:30.29]Okay.
[135:32.88]This is the place to go here.
[135:33.92]Alright, so... One of these houses has, like, a dungeon.
[135:36.30]Let's find it.
[135:36.64]Is that... Somebody said the map fragments are actually labeled...
[136:03.83]Is that- what do that means?
[136:10.53]That's the map fragment.
[136:12.81]Are you serious?
[136:16.17]So that- okay that one's literally right next to the bonfire.
[136:21.58]That's the map.
[136:22.44]Yeah.
[136:23.68]Oh shit.
[136:27.06]They're labeled as stone tablets.
[136:35.62]Where is it?
[136:36.42]Where is it?
[136:55.83]Oh.
[136:59.01]Oh.
[137:00.57]Okay.
[137:02.27]Alright.
[137:03.43]I get it.
[137:04.07]A new map.
[137:06.33]Oh.
[137:07.35]Alright.
[137:08.95]Okay.
[137:11.29]I understand that now.
[137:15.48]Hey, what?
[137:15.78]You went to Wikipedia!
[137:16.82]I didn't even go to Wikipedia!
[137:21.06]There's one here too.
[137:21.64]Alright.
[137:25.66]I'm going to explore this because I want to see what's here.
[137:27.30]I got to find the dungeon.
[137:37.88]In this area.
[137:39.84]Because I want to.
[137:41.16]And I'm going to.
[137:41.96]There's going to be a little spot to go.
[137:49.03]And then he said make these guys pay.
[137:53.89]For what they've done.
[137:59.04]Looking for an entrance of some kind, or an underground passage of some kind, or a thing of some kind to look at.
[138:07.00]It's labeled up here.
[138:10.91]That does not necessarily mean that's where you go.
[138:13.85]Or maybe it does.
[138:14.39]I feel like I'm fairly close.
[138:26.92]Where are we at?
[138:38.35]They're underground somewhere, right?
[138:39.87]They're under here.
[138:40.51]Are we here?
[138:42.59]This looks promising.
[138:51.24]Shit.
[138:59.16]Ooh.
[139:00.34]That's good.
[139:04.76]Nice.
[139:19.75]Hmm.
[139:21.63]I guess it could be any one of these houses.
[139:29.00]I need to drain the lake.
[139:37.02]What's this?
[139:43.23]Uh... Uh... Huh?
[139:59.17]Where's this go?
[140:12.92]Holy shit.
[140:13.94]Okay.
[140:14.14]Oh, there's a map!
[140:23.06]Oh my goodness.
[140:24.52]Okay, so that took me all the way over here.
[140:28.25]What is out this?
[140:29.21]It's a pirate ship!
[140:33.13]Can I swim?
[140:33.69]Is there a bonfire over here somewhere?
[140:43.48]I want to go to the pirate ship.
[140:56.18]Wait, there's a... There's a... I feel like somebody made that in... I mean, I said a rollercoaster tycoon.
[141:07.96]That's like a rollercoaster tycoon setup.
[141:11.34]like I like made that like I had a roller coaster and a roller coaster on top of another roller coaster and I I had to make an elevated passage with like a queue going up because like that's where the entrance is that looks so weird that doesn't look like it should be real this dude loves planet coaster
[141:39.30]I'm just looking for, like, the bridge that comes out.
[141:42.52]Like, this way, this way, down, down, down, down, that way, that way, that way, down, down, down, that way, that way, down, down, down.
[141:49.57]You know what I mean?
[141:50.01]Like... Oh, I can't show it.
[141:52.69]To go over to that side.
[141:57.13]You're not real.
[141:57.93]Yes, I am.
[141:58.33]Okay, so... Pirate ship.
[142:03.34]Can I even go over to it?
[142:08.94]Jesus.
[142:15.70]Iron Chip is out here.
[142:16.68]That's not it, right?
[142:22.22]Where am I looking?
[142:23.36]Okay.
[142:23.60]Maybe there's a teleport to it?
[142:41.14]Well, at least I'll be able to find the key now.
[142:51.74]I don't care about any of you.
[142:53.38]What is that?
[143:01.27]What are they pulling?
[143:01.87]A wagon?
[143:02.33]Are they on the same team?
[143:10.42]What is that?
[143:10.96]It's like the king inside of there?
[143:15.01]Oh, shit.
[143:17.93]That's so many people.
[143:28.09]This is fucking terrible.
[143:35.53]Oh, you hurt.
[143:38.01]And of course you jump off the goddamn thing.
[143:40.05]Of course you do.
[143:40.99]Yes, of course you do.
[143:43.21]Why wouldn't you accidentally press the left stick?
[143:59.80]That's cool.
[144:04.40]I want to... Okay, I want to go back over there.
[144:08.42]Because that's actually really cool.
[144:09.26]I want to see what's going on.
[144:11.86]Yeah, this stream is explore stream.
[144:22.89]Explore until I want to fight a bad guy.
[144:28.45]I'm not going to fight him, though.
[144:29.21]I think we're probably too low.
[144:35.57]I want to see what's going on inside of that thing.
[144:38.41]There's probably a weapon or an item or something, right?
[144:40.93]I feel like there has to be.
[144:49.12]It's so heavily guarded.
[144:50.84]There's so many people.
[144:54.74]Okay, should I just call the boys and just run over there and open it?
[145:07.77]Why can't I call the boys?
[145:10.65]Why do I feel like the sheep are part of the crew here?
[145:15.95]I'm just gonna go for it.
[145:17.97]This is... I feel like I'm playing... Oh my god, it really is.
[145:20.89]It really is.
[145:21.36]There's a chest there.
[145:22.26]There's actually a chest in the back.
[145:23.58]This is worth dying for.
[145:25.20]Okay, I don't have any souls.
[145:26.82]Who gives a shit?
[145:33.00]I'm just gonna jump out there and open it.
[145:46.48]I didn't know they were all gonna hear it.
[145:47.90]I thought I had a chance.
[145:48.74]I thought I could slowly do the thing that everybody did on Dust Bowl.
[145:57.93]Open it!
[146:00.33]It has to stop.
[146:00.99]Alright, stop moving.
[146:13.58]Come on, I gotta rob this fucking thing.
[146:16.38]Oh my god, I'm gonna get it!
[146:17.12]Holy shit, it's a carrion night sword.
[146:21.69]Holy shit, I think that's intelligence.
[146:29.70]Oh, and by the way, you thought you could fight me?
[146:31.82]I'm pretty much a goddamn superhero!
[146:50.02]Oh!
[147:07.15]Fuck everybody!
[147:07.93]Fuck everybody!
[147:11.65]Get him!
[147:11.99]Get him!
[147:12.29]He's hacking!
[147:13.81]He's a fucking hacker!
[147:19.32]Somebody ban him.
[147:19.98]Ban that guy.
[147:22.14]Oh, you want to try and ban me?
[147:23.16]I'm just a fucking hacker.
[147:36.88]What the fuck?
[147:37.60]He's not even supposed to have that move yet.
[147:47.80]I didn't have any souls, I don't care.
[147:56.36]I got what I came for.
[148:00.68]Yes!
[148:03.04]The Carrion Knight's Sword.
[148:04.49]It's a magic sword.
[148:05.53]It scales with intelligence.
[148:08.15]Scales with intelligence.
[148:09.69]Say it again.
[148:10.23]Scales with intelligence.
[148:11.89]Do you see that it scales with intelligence?
[148:14.47]Now I don't have to be Caster Andy anymore.
[148:17.36]Well, I will, right?
[148:18.18]But this is perfect.
[148:20.94]Dex and int scaling.
[148:23.54]Keep that in mind.
[148:26.45]Oh, my God.
[148:27.09]The run is saved.
[148:28.13]Oh, look at how pretty it is, too.
[148:44.46]Oh, yes.
[148:45.31]It's actually just a regular ass weapon.
[148:47.89]It's a weapon.
[148:48.67]It has a normal swinging pattern.
[148:53.39]It's gonna be perfect.
[148:57.35]This is the weapon that I have to level up.
[148:58.81]This is it.
[148:59.32]This is the one.
[149:02.96]Weapon art is that stupid piece of shit, but that's okay.
[149:06.59]We don't have to be we don't have to be that angry about that considering But wait a minute here, what was that?
[149:14.61]I did it three times It's a bigger sword and it's faster
[149:33.96]It can block.
[149:38.79]It's got a big charge.
[149:40.43]It's just kind of got a regular swinging pattern.
[149:43.41]And I can use spells while I use it.
[149:47.21]I can change it too, yeah.
[149:48.47]But actually, that might be kind of good.
[149:49.75]Alright, this is bathroom break time because I actually found the weapon I'm actually going to upgrade.
[149:57.54]Uh, so you gotta make a choice eventually here.
[150:00.37]This thing looks cool.
[150:02.09]It's exactly, exactly what I need for my build.
[150:05.31]This, I'm going to upgrade this weapon to like plus 10.
[150:08.56]This is it.
[150:16.40]Very happy.
[150:18.36]Finally found one.
[150:20.40]We would find in faith, faith, faith, fire, faith, faith, fire, fire, strength, strength, strength, strength, faith, fire, strength, faith.
[150:28.75]Finally, we run into an int weapon.
[150:32.59]It's a good one.
[150:33.03]Alright.
[150:34.90]E-break.
[150:35.22]I'm right back.
[150:36.76]And I'm going to refill this.
[150:38.68]Go upgrade this sword.
[150:40.54]Let's go.
[150:42.30]Please show where that is on the map.
[150:44.75]For those of you that actually really want it.
[150:47.10]It might not be... The databases for the game might not even be there.
[150:50.32]So if you really want to know.
[150:53.60]It was along this road here.
[150:57.66]I rode down this road.
[150:59.77]I was looking for the pirate ship.
[151:02.11]So here's the pirate ship.
[151:04.13]So I got... I was up here.
[151:06.25]And I went down this road here.
[151:08.19]And it was this area here, right?
[151:09.43]I actually kind of don't remember.
[151:11.58]Yeah, it was like here.
[151:12.14]Right here.
[151:14.30]This is where that is.
[151:15.08]You want to see it on the bigger map, you can.
[151:22.00]Right here.
[151:24.62]This island thing, directly left of the island, there's two guys pulling the wagon.
[151:31.12]Look at how pretty it is.
[151:32.34]I want to get a close-up of it.
[151:34.87]I want it in the light, too.
[151:46.21]It's been so fucking funny.
[151:51.57]I gotta get a screenshot for my guild.
[152:03.28]No!
[152:03.78]No!
[152:03.98]I don't want it to rain.
[152:05.35]Hey!
[152:09.83]Fine, I'll go home.
[152:14.39]I'll be right back.
[152:15.11]I'm going to go upgrade this thing and I will see you guys in a minute.
[152:19.32]I won't forget to loop the music this time.
[152:21.65]I'll be right back.
[153:52.91]Thank you.
[155:19.99]Thank you.
[157:47.64]you
[159:48.06]See?
[159:48.46]It looped.
[159:50.96]Looped.
[159:53.38]Alright.
[159:57.48]Let's get back to it.
[159:58.22]Turn that down.
[160:05.73]Turn this up.
[160:14.96]Well.
[160:18.43]I want to upgrade.
[160:20.80]It's time to upgrade.
[160:24.94]Let's do it.
[160:30.14]Oh, my drink!
[160:31.20]Wait.
[160:31.42]Give me a sec.
[160:33.82]I left my drink on the counter.
[160:53.80]Okay, I'm back.
[160:54.88]I left my drink on the counter.
[161:00.19]Okay.
[161:02.41]Back to Elden Ring.
[161:04.08]And I'm going to take a minute because I want to go upgrade this weapon.
[161:06.22]If you're just joining us.
[161:07.92]Holy goodness, we got some good news.
[161:12.03]I finally found a weapon.
[161:14.52]Called the Carrion Knight Sword.
[161:16.10]It scales with strength, dex, and intelligence.
[161:21.20]Which eventually here after a few upgrades could turn out to be a very big deal.
[161:24.52]Very cool sword.
[161:26.84]I wonder how the scaling changes after a few stone upgrades.
[161:37.19]Let's go find out.
[161:47.73]What's on the shirt?
[161:48.19]It's an Andy Mark shirt.
[161:50.71]Whatever floats your goat.
[161:52.97]Uh, Andy Mark.
[161:58.49]Okay.
[162:00.11]Left of the fireplace.
[162:01.49]I remember this time.
[162:02.21]There's actually, I think... Is there a new NPC here?
[162:05.93]I swear I just saw one.
[162:09.47]The decision is final.
[162:11.15]I have to pick something.
[162:12.19]I can't just bounce around anymore.
[162:14.97]Here we go.
[162:15.63]Upgrade this thing.
[162:18.33]I can't.
[162:18.77]Why?
[162:18.99]Why not?
[162:24.72]I have zero dollars.
[162:27.78]Wait.
[162:30.92]Come on.
[162:31.80]Why?
[162:32.66]Let's go sell something to that lady.
[162:40.29]Where are you at?
[162:40.91]You're down here, right?
[162:41.75]Yeah.
[162:45.13]I'm going to call them dollars.
[162:51.25]I want to sell.
[162:54.09]Who can I sell to?
[162:57.84]Who can I sell to?
[163:08.87]Who can I sell to?
[163:11.05]Can I sell to the blacksmith?
[163:14.01]Forget.
[163:14.29]I can.
[163:14.87]I'm an idiot.
[163:19.25]Alright, I need, I just need like a few hundred.
[163:21.15]I don't know what like any of this shit does.
[163:27.22]Crafting, I gotta learn this.
[163:28.62]Alright, we'll take it in a minute.
[163:31.92]I know, there's a filler episode here, okay?
[163:41.15]Yield.
[163:44.48]It's time to get rid of some of this stuff.
[163:45.58]I'm not going to use the short sword.
[163:46.68]Just sell it.
[163:48.46]I'm not going to use the long sword.
[163:49.79]This thing, no.
[163:51.03]Sell it.
[163:51.31]I'll touch that.
[163:52.87]I'm not going to... I have two daggers.
[163:54.49]Just give me one.
[163:58.11]I'm not going to use the S-stock.
[164:03.05]Wait, wait, what?
[164:05.98]I'm not going to use the axe.
[164:09.47]I'm not going to use the Lucerne.
[164:13.35]I'm not going to use this either.
[164:15.05]And it's worth a lot.
[164:16.21]But I'm scared to delete it.
[164:17.23]Okay, here we go.
[164:19.59]So this is going to be... 88.
[164:23.16]Now it's 100.
[164:24.62]That's so much better.
[164:25.72]There we go.
[164:29.04]I need Somber Smithing Stones to keep this going.
[164:37.95]Hell yeah.
[164:40.13]So if you- I gotta make sure I- wait.
[164:43.17]Oh, I already have him, bro!
[164:44.31]I already got him!
[164:44.97]Let's go!
[164:45.37]I just need runes!
[164:48.15]Alright, I'm just- I'm just- I'm just- I'm just- Alright, just kill two people!
[164:55.05]I'm just gonna go just... lay these people out.
[165:04.52]Give us an opportunity to test the sword as well.
[165:07.08]See how much damage it does, because it's probably gonna do a lot.
[165:11.51]Alright, he's gonna find a group of people to kill.
[165:14.89]Shouldn't be too hard.
[165:18.46]Yeah, like this guy.
[165:19.24]150 fucking 7 damage.
[165:30.87]And this shit ain't even upgraded.
[165:32.19]Over 100 damage strength.
[165:43.21]I need, like, probably two or three thousand souls.
[165:47.73]Is that OP?
[165:48.89]Well, it's not necessarily because I'm... Build... I'm... I'm... Look at my build.
[165:56.80]This is exactly what I was looking for.
[165:59.20]This item was made for me.
[166:00.40]Alright, how is it on horseback?
[166:06.28]Awesome on horseback.
[166:08.04]Yep, perfect.
[166:10.46]What is this thing?
[166:12.91]I don't know.
[166:13.45]It's going to die, whatever it is.
[166:16.49]Feed my rune appetite.
[166:29.39]I can just... It doesn't matter.
[166:30.17]I can just be poisoned.
[166:30.99]It's fine.
[166:34.63]Now I'm going to be a force to actually be reckoned with.
[166:37.39]Bosses now are not going to be a weird combination of meat-eating to dance around and do like 40, 50 damage a swing to everybody.
[166:45.17]Do I not have this?
[166:49.17]I do.
[166:49.33]Get rid of the poison.
[166:55.02]No more meltdowns.
[166:55.80]Got it.
[166:56.68]Let's go kill a lobster.
[167:01.56]Because once I get this a couple more, like, +2, plus three, plus four... It's gonna be, like, where I'm supposed to be.
[167:13.02]He's gonna spit!
[167:33.70]Oh, come on.
[167:34.28]Let me get that.
[167:40.23]What are you doing?
[167:40.89]Why is he standing still?
[167:42.09]I mean, that's cool, but he's a lobster, so it didn't really hurt.
[167:56.86]Oh.
[168:10.34]Why would you ever fight this guy not on a horse?
[168:22.39]Literally looking at chat in the middle of riding around on the horse.
[168:47.69]Wrong spell.
[168:48.67]Okay, how much is that worth?
[169:08.73]It's like a thousand or something, right?
[169:10.17]500, that's it.
[169:19.53]So it's 400, then it's probably going to be like 800.
[169:22.25]So I need another like 500.
[169:23.27]No skill.
[169:34.42]Oh, you could just go... Yeah, the giant dogs fight again.
[169:36.94]Yeah, I could go to the... That's a good farm spot.
[169:41.50]I'll do that real quick.
[169:47.22]Where is it?
[169:47.59]Down here, right?
[169:51.96]Where was that?
[169:55.18]Which one of these was it?
[169:57.30]Not the crystal tunnel.
[169:58.35]It's this one down here.
[170:00.87]There's a map right there as well.
[170:05.11]I'll get the map.
[170:08.33]Yeah, okay.
[170:08.69]This is the farm zone right here.
[170:11.80]Map is over here.
[170:12.46]Let's mark it.
[170:16.60]And... Start the battle!
[170:25.90]Attack!
[170:41.93]Yes, I am the master of chaos.
[170:44.23]I am the master of chaos.
[170:45.41]Mwahaha.
[170:49.50]Mwahaha.
[170:50.26]I am the master of chaos.
[171:04.28]oh big move how many of you guys hate watching me but you're still here because you think it's kind of fun to do that
[171:34.66]What was that lunge, dude?
[171:38.52]11,000 hate watchers.
[171:42.20]Oh, that would, like... I would... I don't know.
[171:45.34]I don't want anyone to, like, hate me.
[171:46.58]That, like, sucks.
[171:58.64]God, his shorts are...
[172:05.20]This is your prize for getting a nice parry.
[172:15.27]Damn.
[172:16.55]Alright, that's definitely enough.
[172:24.14]I can leave.
[172:29.10]Yeah, that's good.
[172:31.34]Wait.
[172:31.84]Actually, there's a little bit more over here.
[172:34.60]How much health do they have?
[172:36.26]Yeah, might as well.
[172:51.29]This is how I actually felt when I was playing, like, MMO PvP, by the way.
[172:54.63]Like, I didn't even know what was happening.
[172:55.87]I didn't know what I was doing.
[172:56.81]I would just cast, like, random moves.
[173:00.34]I would just attack random people.
[173:06.41]I feel like I wasn't doing very much.
[173:07.55]But I was kind of there, helping.
[173:10.11]I wonder, like... Okay.
[173:16.39]Altered Valley.
[173:17.13]Those of you guys that played WoW.
[173:18.33]I think it was actually, like, five people actually playing the game.
[173:21.53]And then, like, 35 other people just... Just walking in random directions.
[173:28.00]I remember people being lost.
[173:30.34]That just weren't even part of the fight.
[173:31.92]They were just, like, walking around, doing stuff.
[173:33.68]They didn't even know where they were.
[173:36.98]Odd.
[173:37.58]I remember- Oh, the map, right.
[173:44.64]40 man raids in WoW.
[173:47.21]What a disaster.
[173:50.93]I remember there were cases of people showing the DPS meter, being like, um, hey, dude, like, it says here on the DPS meter that you're only doing just auto attacks.
[174:00.97]You're not even doing any moves.
[174:04.38]Like, just completely, just not even playing.
[174:06.60]Like, you're just there doing the encounter and just not playing.
[174:11.49]Like, hey man, it says you did like 1,400 damage across the whole fight, which is actually impossible unless you've only been doing auto-attacks.
[174:23.27]Alright, I gotta go this way.
[174:35.19]Oh my god, I got an entire zoo behind me.
[174:37.23]What the fuck?
[174:39.21]Give me the map.
[174:42.71]Oh my god!
[174:46.03]Get away from me.
[174:48.87]Stop guarding the thing I want.
[174:50.59]Get out of the way.
[174:51.17]I got it.
[175:02.55]It looks like a puppet.
[175:03.35]Looks like there's a hand in there.
[175:12.13]Sesame Street.
[175:14.41]Okay, dude, that's enough.
[175:16.61]I've had enough.
[175:17.31]Can I teleport?
[175:21.51]No
[175:44.84]A new map has been found.
[175:46.30]Whoa!
[175:48.52]Those are my souls right there, right?
[175:54.20]Where the fuck are they?
[175:56.24]My souls are right there.
[176:00.08]Upgrade your flask.
[176:00.70]I already did.
[176:01.58]I did.
[176:03.94]Say goodbye to those souls.
[176:04.82]They're not gone.
[176:05.57]They're right here.
[176:05.99]What you should say goodbye to is that attitude.
[176:15.54]Where is he?
[176:19.58]That wasn't even an attitude.
[176:20.58]That was just telling me what was happening.
[176:34.34]Get off my... Stop camping.
[176:42.08]Fine.
[176:42.70]You want to play that game?
[176:43.40]We can play that game.
[176:44.86]What is this?
[176:46.30]Oops.
[176:48.52]I didn't want to... I should be camping my body.
[177:13.26]Alright, let's get the hell out of here.
[177:21.50]Do it.
[177:27.17]I have enough souls, I can upgrade this probably three times.
[177:30.35]Maybe twice?
[177:30.87]Cheesing is so fun.
[177:38.09]What is more cheese?
[177:43.34]casting spells at somebody or somebody camping.
[177:46.76]113.
[177:51.39]Here we go.
[177:53.89]Boom.
[177:56.53]I can do it again.
[177:57.11]Boom.
[178:00.45]I can do it again.
[178:03.55]Oh, this is it.
[178:04.60]I've been saving these stones.
[178:07.92]I have four.
[178:09.60]I have one Somber Smithing Stone.
[178:14.23]Hell yeah.
[178:17.23]Look at that.
[178:18.47]This thing is... This thing is good shit now, plus four.
[178:23.23]Ah, ah, and, boom.
[178:24.49]There it is.
[178:27.53]Ah, boom.
[178:28.67]That's so funny.
[178:30.13]Should I start saying that?
[178:32.97]Should I start saying, like, oh, at, oh, boom.
[178:35.25]There you go.
[178:38.39]I wonder if, at... Maybe, does it stay at D?
[178:42.30]Will it scale D the whole time?
[178:44.73]Sometimes they get higher so it might maybe like one of them will turn to see Now I mean it's not the stupidest idea now to put some points in strength I'm probably not because just have it scale with uh intelligence and dexterity because I that just makes my casting better, too What about your what about the wand
[179:19.09]Where is it?
[179:21.83]I'm going to check out the other ashes thing.
[179:24.21]Okay, so... I'm comfortable putting this on now.
[179:32.77]Alright, dude.
[179:37.63]And this gets to be scaling when I do this.
[179:42.15]Here we go.
[179:45.09]Boom.
[179:46.74]Have I been saying boom?
[179:54.19]Have?
[179:54.69]I've been saying boom.
[179:55.97]I've already been doing that.
[179:58.51]Have I really?
[179:59.39]No, I haven't.
[180:09.01]I've been saying boom?
[180:17.06]So that should even out.
[180:18.18]Look at my cool stuff.
[180:19.20]I still look like an asshole, though.
[180:20.95]I need some better stuff.
[180:22.01]I need some cooler, like, armor.
[180:28.71]I look like trash.
[180:30.41]I look awful.
[180:32.12]I need to match these cool new items that I have for this cool build.
[180:35.20]Alright, I'm ready to tackle this next part, which is we gotta find the key.
[180:46.06]Which, if I look at the map that I have in my inventory.
[180:50.32]It's like in the middle.
[180:57.14]There's an island to the left.
[181:00.00]There's a little island to the right.
[181:01.05]There's a small little peninsula that sticks out.
[181:04.13]It's underneath that.
[181:07.95]Okay, it's right here.
[181:14.47]This is where the glintstone key is.
[181:16.53]We're gonna go get it.
[181:22.48]What was this marked for?
[181:23.22]I don't know.
[181:23.82]Get rid of it.
[181:24.18]This is better than Bloodborne.
[181:53.42]Bloodborne's like my favorite single-player game ever.
[181:56.29]Ever.
[181:57.91]Bloodborne's my favorite single-player game ever.
[181:59.75]Besides maybe... Hold that thought.
[182:07.17]Hold on to it.
[182:09.01]Hold that thought.
[182:10.73]Because... It's tough.
[182:13.89]I think it's hard to let go of something that you find so dear.
[182:17.64]Right?
[182:18.76]Always good to see you, son.
[182:21.05]But how I... About D. Ah.
[182:24.19]So you've met D. D is an old friend.
[182:26.91]You've completed 8% of the game.
[182:28.33]You can't rate it yet.
[182:29.17]That's kind of why I'm saying that.
[182:30.50]But our paths have since diverged.
[182:35.34]Never again to cross.
[182:37.04]Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends.
[182:42.43]I want your outfit.
[182:43.05]How hard is that?
[182:43.73]I want this person's outfit.
[183:12.61]Okay, I have enough to get both of these, which I'm going to.
[183:17.29]Just to have them.
[183:20.33]Let's take a look.
[183:25.70]I got to go to the blacksmith and see if I want to put something else on this sword.
[183:39.93]Alright, it's time for the ultimate hot take.
[183:44.24]Well, not really.
[183:44.80]This is probably not an unpopular opinion right now.
[183:48.58]This kind of feels like every FromSoftware game combined into one game.
[183:55.45]It's every single FromSoftware game.
[183:57.33]They just mushed them all together and just kind of polished it up.
[184:04.02]The one thing that's missing that I like from Bloodborne is I like having a ton of... Bloodborne's heals were instant.
[184:13.08]Being able just to be like, wham, and you're healed like 30-40% was just so... I like that system, but I mean, I didn't really love the system of having to go collect them if you didn't have any.
[184:24.61]But...
[184:28.30]I like the speed of Bloodborne.
[184:30.40]My character being able to move around like crazy was one of my favorite parts of Bloodborne.
[184:37.02]And the trick weapons, yeah.
[184:37.98]The trick weapons were probably... I mean, you can't really do that with the probably hundred plus items that are in this game.
[184:46.59]Trick weapons, the actual theme and the story of Bloodborne, and the speed, that's why it's above everything for me.
[184:57.01]But I just it's hard not to like this because of just how much stuff you can actually really do.
[185:06.80]Because when I play Bloodborne again, I know exactly where I'm going.
[185:11.67]I know what I'm doing.
[185:14.23]I know I'm going to go to... Okay, we're in central Yharnam.
[185:16.51]We're going to go to... Now we're going to go... Okay, we're going to Bergenworth.
[185:20.07]Okay, now we're doing the swamp.
[185:21.49]Like, it's the same exact game pretty much every single time.
[185:24.33]It's incredible.
[185:25.57]It's amazing.
[185:26.47]And it's a ton of fun.
[185:28.07]But it's the same experience almost every time.
[185:29.82]I feel like this is going to be a completely wildly different experience no matter how you play this.
[185:39.53]that on here I mean I could just I mean it's holy but I mean it doesn't I could put it on if I wanted to standard or sacred alright can I not take it off my weapon is this on here permanently
[186:12.04]Can I not put a weapon on this?
[186:16.12]It's on there permanently.
[186:16.94]Okay.
[186:21.91]You can.
[186:23.13]Go sit down to change it.
[186:24.57]Oh, because it's okay.
[186:29.69]But yeah, I mean, it's... The... Everything of... Every time... Okay, think about this.
[186:37.21]There are... From what I've been told...
[186:41.29]An absolutely unbelievable amount of things to do in this game.
[186:45.26]There are... Spoiler alert.
[186:47.76]Because I heard this.
[186:49.02]Just by kind of browsing around and seeing stuff.
[186:51.80]There are apparently... And this is a spoiler for this game.
[186:54.48]But it's not really a spoiler.
[186:55.82]But it's about the content of the game.
[186:58.01]If you don't want to hear it, mute for five seconds.
[187:00.77]There apparently are almost 100 fucking bosses in this game.
[187:05.85]A hundred.
[187:06.63]One hundred.
[187:08.05]One hundred.
[187:12.30]not 15 not like 30 a fucking hundred when I heard that I and then when people were saying oh dude no no no no you're not this is like not even half the map it's just like
[187:29.86]Really?
[187:30.26]Like, I looked forward so much to, like, the DLCs for Dark Souls 3, for Bloodborne.
[187:36.74]They added, like, 10 to 20 hours of content and, like, what, six or seven bosses?
[187:41.53]It was like, holy shit, yeah!
[187:43.29]Because the main game had, like, what, 15 to, like, 20 actual bosses?
[187:49.71]Thinking about a hundred boss encounters?
[187:52.63]And...
[187:54.20]Only, like, I believe only, like, 5 to 10 of them are reskins of, like, enemies in the game.
[187:59.27]They're all, like, unique encounters.
[188:03.19]It's 83.
[188:04.05]Come on, dude.
[188:06.05]I mean, still.
[188:07.35]You don't think they're gonna do DLC for this game and bring it to, like, 100, 110?
[188:13.03]Way more than 10 are reskins.
[188:17.37]Only 83.
[188:17.61]LOL.
[188:17.81]83 is still great.
[188:20.80]Even if there is, like, slight reskins and stuff, but that's still...
[188:26.20]I read that there's at least 50 unique encounters somewhere.
[188:29.32]74 unique ones, according to a chatter.
[188:31.40]That's ridiculous.
[188:32.78]That's more people that are in Smash Bros.
[188:35.78]That's bigger than the Smash Bros.
[188:37.28]roster at this point.
[188:40.71]So that's, I mean, that's crazy to think about that there's that much stuff to do.
[188:49.39]It's almost overwhelming, which is why I'm trying to... We're taking a little bit of time here on this stream to kind of slow it down a little because it's very overwhelming of being able to kind of go anywhere.
[189:02.83]And there's so much stuff to explore that I kind of want to... Like, let's slow it down a little.
[189:09.69]Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[189:13.81]So anyways, there's my... As it stands right now,
[189:19.38]This is probably at this point right now.
[189:21.16]I have to see some of the more bosses.
[189:24.08]Especially the main story ones.
[189:27.63]But this is like, if you talk about the brackets.
[189:31.33]Like Bloodborne is like really like desperately like reaching to grab at the heels of this game right now.
[189:37.11]At least in the first like 10 to 20 hours of both experiences.
[189:46.14]Because I did not feel that way about Sekiro.
[189:48.34]Let me be really honest.
[189:50.87]Sekiro was good, was really cool, but Sekiro was just a lot different and it was kind of, it was a little much for me too.
[190:02.13]I find Sekiro to be like the hardest game I think I've ever played.
[190:05.30]Um, just because of the amount of like the parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, like the bosses that had like five phases.
[190:13.36]It was really, really, really a lot.
[190:16.50]Um,
[190:19.06]So I think this kind of sits in a spot that I like.
[190:21.56]We'll see.
[190:21.88]Are you the kind of person that tries and completes every dungeon and side quest in an area?
[190:30.03]Not particularly, but I love the fact that it's there.
[190:32.69]Because if I play this game again, which I'm absolutely going to...
[190:37.20]Instead of doing like this, I could do like this.
[190:42.88]Or like this.
[190:43.70]Or this.
[190:45.52]I don't have to follow the exact same path.
[190:46.90]Even if I want to come back here, right?
[190:48.18]There's stuff I haven't done.
[190:50.25]The fact that it's available means you can replay it more than a few times and see stuff you've never seen before.
[190:59.01]I think it's great.
[191:01.89]But I'm holding my tongue a little bit just because I don't want to be one of those people that's like, this is definitely the best game ever made.
[191:09.21]It has to be.
[191:10.07]Nothing can compare.
[191:11.31]And then like the next three, four main story bosses I talk about like, these suck.
[191:14.77]This game sucks.
[191:15.35]I don't want to like kind of jump the gun on this a little.
[191:21.09]But it does kind of feel like it is one of the better single player experiences I've ever had.
[191:27.23]Especially in the first like 10 to 20 hours.
[191:32.35]Because I know how much there is to do.
[191:34.55]You do that for every game, though.
[191:35.69]So that's what... Okay, yeah.
[191:37.73]Resident Evil 8.
[191:38.93]I just make... I just talk shit about every game I play.
[191:41.99]It's a coping mechanism.
[191:43.01]Don't you get it?
[191:43.54]You understand by now?
[191:44.50]Like, I don't actually hate these games.
[191:46.56]It's just for my brain.
[191:47.94]My, like, egomaniac brain is like, There's no way it's you're the problem!
[191:53.30]Tell them!
[191:53.90]Tell them it's not you!
[191:55.10]Tell them to unbind left stick!
[191:57.67]UNBIND LEFT STICK!
[191:58.80]AND ALSO TELL THEM TO EAT THE BROCCOLI TOO BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF VITAMIN K!
[192:03.50]EAT BROCCOLI, IT'S GOOD!
[192:04.32]AND ALSO TELL THEM THAT THIS BOSS IS TOO SLOW!
[192:07.92]Like, I... Of course, that's like ego, right?
[192:10.89]Like... No, it's not me.
[192:12.29]It's fucking... It's not me.
[192:13.47]It's the game's fault that I wasn't able to do that.
[192:16.01]But, like, it's cope.
[192:17.51]You're coping with the fact that you're not doing something as fast as you want to.
[192:21.94]PLAY THE GAME ALREADY?
[192:26.18]I'm giving you, I've played the game for like 20 hours and I'm giving you how I feel about the game.
[192:30.28]I'm a reviewer of video games.
[192:35.12]Play the game so much of you, play the games you like it so much.
[192:37.90]I'm reviewing this game.
[192:38.97]People come to me and they look for their, their, how they feel about games.
[192:44.07]This is where they come.
[192:45.39]They come in, they say, what does he think about it?
[192:47.33]What does he have to say?
[192:49.69]How does he feel about this?
[192:51.71]We need to know.
[193:08.05]Where are those ashes?
[193:09.75]There it is.
[193:10.49]No.
[193:12.41]I think that's on there permanently, guys.
[193:14.72]It is.
[193:17.28]I cannot take that off.
[193:18.88]That's the downside to that weapon.
[193:22.10]That's alright.
[193:22.60]Here we go.
[193:23.50]We're going.
[193:23.92]We're going.
[193:24.29]We're going.
[193:24.57]We're going.
[193:24.95]Fine.
[193:25.31]Fine.
[193:25.59]Play the game.
[193:26.21]Play the game.
[193:26.81]Play the game.
[193:27.45]Play the game.
[193:28.05]Play the game.
[193:38.66]Usually you play something like Fart Simulator 2013.
[193:40.44]We're not used to your takes on video games.
[193:45.48]Let me test this out.
[193:51.86]How do I get to do the weapon art for this?
[193:56.72]I can't because it's in my hand.
[193:58.12]What about this?
[194:00.38]Does it have to be my right hand?
[194:02.94]Because that's like the spinning shield thing.
[194:17.20]It's Y and L2.
[194:18.22]That was stupid.
[194:29.68]This is a magic trick.
[194:35.46]See, there are no strings where I'm attached.
[194:37.62]There's nothing, no strings on my arms.
[194:44.73]Okay, well, that was... That was dumb.
[194:54.91]It's a pretty cool party trick, though, yeah.
[194:56.88]Alright, let's get on the horse.
[194:57.80]We're going... It's this way.
[194:59.84]We're going to marker number three.
[195:02.40]Play the game already.
[195:04.06]We don't want to hear you talk.
[195:05.50]We want to see you play and talk.
[195:09.04]Do two things at once and hurry up.
[195:13.35]My food's almost here.
[195:15.30]And I want to be able to eat my cheese pizza while you're playing this game and you're wasting time.
[195:25.75]I've been waiting sitting with a pizza in front of me and it's getting cold.
[195:30.11]I won't eat one bite until you start riding on the horse.
[195:33.73]Hurry up.
[195:43.38]So you said I'm doing that now?
[195:48.27]Dude, my pizza's cold now.
[195:50.53]And you slam your fucking hands on your desk.
[195:58.52]Alright, this is weird.
[195:59.28]What's going on here?
[196:07.88]These are those things that give spells in Ashes of War.
[196:23.58]Is this actually just kind of like a jackpot?
[196:28.06]It is not.
[196:28.82]Okay.
[196:30.02]I didn't know.
[196:30.32]I was thinking maybe this is like a jackpot.
[196:38.11]There's something over there.
[196:40.43]I don't know what that is.
[196:47.02]Is it a dragon?
[196:49.24]That's a sleeping dragon.
[196:55.99]Oh shit.
[196:56.45]Did you hear me?
[197:12.98]I didn't hear me.
[197:20.91]Smarg?
[197:21.49]Flintstone Dragon Smarg.
[197:27.03]Isn't that kind of like, isn't that dragon?
[197:29.15]What?
[197:31.54]Well, here we go.
[197:33.26]Another dragon fight.
[197:34.68]We all love these ones.
[197:39.70]Actually, I'm going to do this.
[197:46.19]Breathe fire.
[197:48.83]Oh, he breathed glintstone fire.
[197:58.20]holy shit it's like super missiles I have no mana I have no I have no I have no run man I can't call I can't call the boys either
[198:38.53]There's a fire right here too.
[198:46.95]I think I'm going to try the plunge.
[198:57.04]I'm going to try right trigger attack.
[198:59.20]Heavy attack.
[199:02.14]He goes with this bullshit and he goes wham.
[199:11.62]I don't think it's much better.
[199:12.44]Stick with what I'm doing.
[199:13.56]Stick with it.
[199:13.95]Can you shoot behind him?
[199:45.58]Don't be greedy.
[199:47.12]Wait.
[199:47.28]Yeah, that's why I didn't want to do that.
[199:52.98]Does he have no eyes?
[200:05.41]Now that was an epic scene.
[200:21.04]It's coming!
[200:31.05]Button press on my keyboard!
[200:34.75]Button press!
[200:42.02]Didn't unbind it.
[200:46.46]Oh!
[201:25.72]Don't swipe your tail at me don't even think about it Oh you ugly
[201:58.34]Holy shit, he killed me in one hit.
[202:05.70]One hit.
[202:06.04]Damn.
[202:12.62]Damn.
[202:20.04]Well...
[202:26.12]Maybe I need more health.
[202:26.72]If I don't get one hit killed by that.
[202:32.27]I'll come back to him.
[202:33.91]That's really cool.
[202:36.07]I'll come back to him.
[202:46.93]There's the bear.
[202:47.73]I found the bear.
[202:55.48]That was such a shitty reveal.
[202:56.90]I wanted to like actually see the bear.
[203:15.63]Is that too far?
[203:16.39]No, it's not.
[203:19.37]Alright, come here.
[203:20.09]Where are you?
[203:20.73]That was a cool thing that we were just doing.
[203:27.23]Is it a gorilla?
[203:28.37]No, it's a bear.
[203:28.87]It's like a bear gorilla.
[203:38.17]I'm sneaking behind you.
[203:39.47]What's the point of a sneak in this game?
[203:41.05]Dude, there's so many fucking giant creatures.
[204:01.80]Oh my god!
[204:02.88]Wait, where's that taking me?
[204:24.23]Where the hell am I?
[204:26.95]I don't want to be here.
[204:30.01]Oh, I was supposed to go get the key.
[204:33.23]right alright well I mean I literally can't even hurt these people so we're gonna have to come back later I need to go get the key to go in this way okay very cool let's go
[205:10.85]I have a big feeling that that dragon drops something that I would be very interested in acquiring.
[205:18.99]Can't speak around it.
[205:24.27]I don't really understand the appeal of Souls games.
[205:25.87]We used to have SNES games where you had to try multiple strategies to beat a boss that still being able to be used today is like... I don't even know.
[205:32.72]I'm sorry.
[205:33.08]I missed it.
[205:33.58]It was going too fast.
[205:35.54]Oh, my eyes.
[205:36.24]Okay.
[205:38.36]I do not wake the dragon.
[205:39.68]I'm not doing that right now.
[205:40.98]I think I have to have a little bit more health.
[205:44.06]And maybe some more magic resistance.
[205:45.76]Because I have a lot of it on right now.
[205:54.83]Wait.
[205:56.77]Oh, no.
[205:58.49]This is the guy that has the key.
[206:02.31]I have... I have to kill this guy with the key.
[206:07.06]Because he's gonna drop the key.
[206:11.46]Right.
[206:15.22]Unless it's behind him.
[206:18.20]He could be sleeping on it.
[206:21.65]Maybe... Maybe he's sleeping on it or something.
[206:35.13]There it is.
[206:57.93]I'm trying to sneak and he can hear me.
[206:59.38]Flintstone Key Academy.
[207:07.36]Goodbye.
[207:11.78]That's terrifying.
[207:12.74]Okay.
[207:14.04]Bye.
[207:14.42]I just wanted to steal your treasure.
[207:16.19]Sleep.
[207:21.21]Oh, magnificent smag.
[207:25.84]Your presence precedes you.
[207:27.30]Oh, isn't that what a thief would say?
[207:31.61]Oh, terrifying enough, our vulture, Smaragd.
[207:37.09]The legends truly are correct when they describe you.
[207:44.92]I always want you to take it.
[207:47.54]So I could see the look on his face when he sees that when he goes in there, into the academy, he's way too underleveled.
[207:57.01]Oh, great and powerful Sparag!
[208:05.76]Okay, he's gone.
[208:08.64]Goku?
[208:11.28]I got it.
[208:11.90]That was fun.
[208:14.63]Excuse me Well, okay, I'm gonna investigate what's going on over here cuz like who are these people and I'm very curious Who are you and what are you protecting?
[208:42.14]I love when I hit somebody with this weapon, there's like a blue splash because it's magic damage.
[208:46.40]Hell yeah.
[208:49.79]What are they doing over here?
[208:50.67]I'm curious how much damage this actually does.
[208:56.17]Let's find out. 800.
[209:11.78]There's a lot, but I don't think it justifies swinging it.
[209:16.50]It's a really bad ability.
[209:17.63]Yeah, it is.
[209:20.41]I can see that that might be kind of cool when there's a huge group of enemies and they're all piled up before we kill them all in one hit.
[209:28.31]But besides that, it's kind of junk.
[209:34.60]Punish staggers.
[209:37.50]Ah, that's true.
[209:40.39]Okay, if I stagger someone, right?
[209:43.03]Let's say I stagger a boss.
[209:44.29]Or a boss is, like, in the middle of changing to, like, phase two.
[209:48.30]Is that worth just charging that up, I wonder?
[209:52.04]You gotta find Bob.
[209:53.08]Alright, I'm gonna go open the door.
[210:06.35]I don't know where that is.
[210:15.50]Open the door.
[210:17.15]I have a key.
[210:18.85]Let me in!
[210:29.66]That was a certified gob moment.
[210:36.74]Ooh.
[210:37.36]Kind of in here.
[210:39.85]Damn.
[210:43.41]Alright.
[210:46.66]What is that?
[210:57.67]I love how much of a gamer you are when it comes to Souls games, but everything else, you're a clown man.
[211:06.90]Well, you have to understand.
[211:09.14]You can't... I can't...
[211:12.12]I can't, like, be clown guy in the middle of some of these boss fights.
[211:16.92]It doesn't work.
[211:19.12]I have to really try to play the game and really have to... Where am I going?
[211:27.20]Wait, is this back out?
[211:31.37]You saw what happened when I was funny clown guy.
[211:33.79]What the fuck?
[211:40.01]Okay.
[211:40.37]I'm gonna run.
[211:45.97]I need to be, I gotta go into the academy.
[211:54.03]Deliver the key to the apprentice now.
[211:55.83]The one that you bought spells.
[211:56.79]Yeah, I was thinking about, I think, is that going to get rid of the key though?
[212:01.81]If I give him the key, won't it expel it and I can't come back in here?
[212:04.57]I feel like I need to, I want to do this, clear this first.
[212:16.08]Academy of Raya Lucaria.
[212:52.80]Hogwarts This is my hometown, this is my like home turf here
[213:21.91]Okay.
[213:22.67]Blink your eyes a few times and let's go.
[213:30.82]I actually really liked Bergenworth in Bloodborne and I was sad that it was not that large.
[213:36.80]Something about like an academy.
[213:39.78]Like a magic academy.
[213:41.19]I think it's really interesting.
[213:44.89]Bergenworth was awesome.
[213:45.93]This is kind of like Bergenworth.
[213:46.99]This is big Bergenworth because I'm going to love it.
[213:53.82]Oh, you want to play the casting game, huh?
[213:56.73]Alright, fellow wizards.
[214:04.81]Never mind.
[214:05.67]Never mind.
[214:06.49]Slice.
[214:06.97]Slice.
[214:21.31]I don't think I'm... Yeah, they probably have a ton of magic resistance because they're wizards.
[214:27.08]I might not be as useful here as I think I am.
[214:35.70]They're all the Burger King.
[214:39.99]You just ruined this whole area, dude.
[214:43.35]You ruined this whole game for me now.
[214:47.21]Come on.
[214:53.97]holy that sucked run
[215:31.34]Woo!
[215:33.38]Woo!
[215:35.97]See, 50 subs.
[215:36.83]Brock Lee gets 50 subs.
[215:38.29]What are you doing?
[215:38.95]That's insane.
[215:41.15]Holy shit, dude.
[215:42.01]I guess it was 50 subs.
[215:49.42]I love this area.
[215:50.46]I do.
[215:51.24]I love it.
[215:52.62]Okay.
[215:52.97]We go?
[215:56.93]This might be my favorite area of the game.
[215:58.13]I'm going to make a prediction.
[216:03.35]I'm going to be sad if I'm wrong.
[216:11.75]I can upgrade the weapon again.
[216:13.57]I think.
[216:19.45]You just got here 30 seconds ago, dude.
[216:21.53]Yeah, but, I mean, come on.
[216:22.93]Do you hear, like, the chimes?
[216:25.33]Burger King wizards?
[216:31.42]Weird people that are, like, freaking out.
[216:44.61]Oh.
[216:49.12]I'm going to do less mana potions here.
[216:51.52]Because I feel like... I feel like I'm not going to be casting that often.
[216:59.32]Because they're casters.
[217:00.48]And I would probably rather just get up there and smash them.
[217:02.26]What's he saying?
[217:07.35]Burger King paintings?
[217:19.82]That's so dumb.
[217:21.35]That's so dumb.
[217:22.19]That's so dumb that it makes me laugh.
[217:28.87]Outside.
[217:34.28]Don't assume we're gonna go around.
[217:56.57]Smithing Stone.
[217:57.21]Looks like a Dark Souls 3 area.
[218:08.57]Uh... What the fuck?
[218:15.57]Wow.
[218:16.07]That's enormous.
[218:25.85]These guys have a lot of health.
[218:36.59]That's not going to work, is it?
[218:40.13]Oi.
[218:42.22]Oi.
[218:42.54]Oi.
[218:43.62]Oi.
[218:44.64]Oi.
[218:44.82]How much damage does this do?
[218:48.90]Not very much at all.
[218:50.14]They're really slow, though.
[218:53.90]Get off me.
[218:54.22]What?
[218:54.34]What?
[218:56.36]Oh, he just sucked all my mana.
[219:13.45]Not worth doing.
[219:21.97]Get off of me!
[219:23.01]Where was he even coming from?
[219:29.59]Oh my god, they're fucking everywhere!
[219:42.36]Get the fuck away from me!
[220:00.46]They're so fast and they want to... I'm dead.
[220:05.70]I gotta line them up so I can hit them more.
[220:07.66]I can do a cleave.
[220:08.48]That cleave is good.
[220:17.74]Got it.
[220:21.78]Okay.
[220:24.20]One more.
[220:28.62]He does a- he double taps it.
[220:30.38]You do it twice.
[220:40.80]Stop whining.
[220:43.70]Am I whining?
[220:44.20]Am I whining?
[220:46.29]I'm exp- What are you talking about?
[220:51.85]These are disgusting creatures, hey.
[220:53.29]They're using magic on magic eaters.
[221:00.46]Spell proof liver.
[221:08.45]Okay, bridge now.
[221:14.11]This thing's going down.
[221:17.03]Right?
[221:17.33]Like this thing's, of course, it's going down.
[221:27.74]This bridge is going down.
[221:30.39]Shit, that dog.
[221:32.35]I'm gonna accidentally slice this and the bridge is gonna collapse.
[221:35.03]I'm just, I think that's what's gonna happen.
[221:38.65]Don't dodge on a bridge, you fool.
[221:40.84]Alright.
[221:46.46]I can't dodge here.
[221:49.24]You get off me!
[221:51.80]Don't dodge.
[221:52.99]Get away.
[221:58.89]I hate this.
[222:26.76]Just do it.
[222:27.89]Do it!
[222:57.87]They're just so, they're so, they taunt you.
[223:00.09]They're just like, I'm gonna do it.
[223:01.51]I'm gonna do it in a second.
[223:02.85]And I'm gonna do it a few times in a row.
[223:04.43]I gotta just go in now.
[223:07.85]It's just like, hey.
[223:09.09]Hey, you know it's gonna happen.
[223:10.43]You know I'm gonna do it.
[223:14.15]I'm out of potions.
[223:22.16]Just seeing what would happen.
[223:27.04]What was that?
[223:27.58]Something sprinted by my face.
[223:31.72]What was that?
[223:34.25]What was that?
[223:35.67]What was that?
[223:36.45]That was like a dust ball.
[223:51.04]It was the Blair Witch.
[223:54.58]I'm probably going to die here.
[224:14.60]These guys you have to just attack them over and over again do not let them even get one second of time Not even a second
[224:28.59]The guy right behind me.
[224:29.59]He's over there.
[224:30.05]He's over here.
[224:30.49]He's over there.
[224:30.89]He's over there.
[224:40.22]Yeah.
[224:40.71]You just gotta... They're probably spawning behind me.
[225:16.68]What?
[225:17.22]The f- No!
[225:21.84]He was just ready.
[225:22.98]I didn't even see him.
[225:26.85]I'm running by these chumps.
[225:31.89]The shield?
[225:32.41]Will the shield- Wait, will the shield block that?
[225:33.93]Or is it technically it's a grab, right?
[225:40.74]It's kind of far away.
[225:42.48]Isn't that technically- It's a grab?
[225:43.82]Would that- Would that work?
[225:47.94]Let me try it.
[225:48.28]Ah, that's a grab.
[225:52.10]I don't want to lose those souls, though.
[225:56.01]I was supposed to just run off a cliff.
[225:56.99]I'm just running.
[225:57.53]What about you boys?
[226:01.87]I can't summon them here for some reason.
[226:04.67]Do I not have enough mana?
[226:08.44]No, I can't summon them here.
[226:09.28]They're not allowed here.
[226:22.78]Yeah, fuck it.
[226:23.34]Let's just go.
[226:34.11]Magic Grease.
[226:39.01]And... uh...
[226:49.03]I'm in trouble here.
[226:49.63]This is bad news.
[226:51.05]I'm stuck here.
[226:51.45]There's two fucking bugs.
[226:53.67]Okay.
[226:59.71]I gotta get in that goddamn building.
[227:07.50]How come you suck like this?
[227:09.20]Why do you suck so hard?
[227:14.62]Man, that's a troll comment.
[227:15.58]I mean, I know.
[227:16.34]This is the first time I've ever seen this.
[227:21.65]This isn't like my ninth playthrough of Dark Souls 2.
[227:23.75]What are you talking about?
[227:54.55]Get it and get in the building.
[227:55.55]Go.
[228:01.94]Oh, my God.
[228:06.50]Oh.
[228:08.84]On fire.
[228:16.59]Oh, my.
[228:17.17]Come on, man.
[228:19.21]Not like this.
[228:20.01]Not like this.
[228:24.28]Some of you fucking fall off and die.
[228:25.72]Okay.
[228:33.08]So.
[228:33.30]I just got swarmed.
[228:37.42]Use your shield.
[228:39.04]Guys, I can't... You can't block the grab attack.
[228:41.79]They just grab you.
[228:42.67]It's not a thing you can... I can't block it.
[228:49.00]You want me to hold the shield up where there's five dogs on every single acute angle of my body?
[228:55.52]Ooh, okay I don't like this
[229:20.54]I- What the fuck?
[229:21.60]I can't get it!
[229:22.14]I can't reach that!
[229:24.07]I can't reach that!
[229:25.19]Whatever that is.
[229:29.81]Holy fucking smokes, dude!
[229:31.43]Alright, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[229:37.97]That just like threw me off so hard.
[229:39.33]You know what?
[229:42.14]Eat shit!
[229:45.02]You know what?
[229:45.84]Eat shit again!
[229:48.82]I know!
[229:49.26]And so we stormed up to shit a third time?
[230:03.34]Oooh, what's that?
[230:11.66]This is intelligence.
[230:12.56]Pulls foes forward.
[230:15.20]Towards caster.
[230:15.98]It's a pull.
[230:20.63]That actually might be really useful.
[230:21.79]Okay, we found like the one enemy where that was actually useful to do it on, but how do I get up here?
[230:28.32]The infamous triple decker.
[230:48.40]It sucks them up.
[230:49.90]Might be fun to play with.
[230:50.60]Actually, it could be.
[230:52.46]You never want to just kind of close gaps in this game, but I wonder if it's a stun.
[230:57.64]I wonder if you pull them and they have like a second or so.
[231:00.74]Maybe it's like a... I wonder if it's a stagger.
[231:06.04]That would be huge if it was.
[231:16.38]Where does this end?
[231:26.74]Holy shit, I almost just died.
[231:30.43]I almost just went all the way around.
[231:32.51]I'm so glad I was facing the right way.
[231:47.01]Get up there.
[231:57.55]312 damage.
[231:58.45]That's so good.
[231:59.39]Those guys are so susceptible to it.
[232:00.68]I saw something over here.
[232:08.56]What was it?
[232:17.06]Wait.
[232:24.21]Alright, hold on.
[232:25.03]Not doing that yet.
[232:25.59]Is this a secret chest?
[232:29.11]Oh, shit.
[232:29.85]Well... Oh, let me... There might be a bonfire up here.
[232:36.00]Yeah, there is.
[232:36.46]Okay.
[232:36.88]Thank God.
[232:50.44]weirdo over there alright I cannot level up yet let's walk over here first what the hell was that wait wait wait wait where's my parry
[233:18.55]Oh, because I changed the weapon art.
[233:20.67]It's not a parry anymore.
[233:22.07]It's like a holy thing.
[233:25.13]Right, right, right, okay.
[233:26.05]Because the parry is technically a weapon art, right.
[233:29.48]Well, I kind of want to fix that.
[233:31.14]Okay, that's better.
[233:48.35]Where's Perry?
[233:49.93]Perry the flattable?
[233:58.58]Ooh, staggered.
[234:18.68]I'm going to put the pull on.
[234:20.28]Let's try.
[234:25.38]Did I fight Godrick?
[234:26.20]I did.
[234:26.64]What does it look like?
[234:36.67]It doesn't take too, too long.
[234:37.73]Let's see what it does.
[234:41.53]Okay.
[234:49.79]actually is really not bad it is a stagger makes him kind of go like you're alive
[235:22.40]It's not a bad move.
[235:24.04]Especially in a one-on-one scenario, if it's a hard enemy, you can just kind of stagger him for a second and get away.
[235:36.61]Oh my lord, this is going to be fucking hell.
[235:44.95]What the fuck?
[235:59.67]Hello.
[236:06.88]Oh, it's the pot guy!
[236:08.10]Everyone was looking for the pot!
[236:11.48]There he is!
[236:12.10]Alright, well I need to... Come here.
[236:21.42]Doesn't work on the pot.
[236:22.66]But, magic... Oh my fucking lord.
[236:25.80]Runaway.
[236:38.10]I don't have enough magic!
[237:03.65]Didn't you say he was in the pot?
[237:06.21]No.
[237:17.05]Okay, they've reset.
[237:18.47]Can I get a backstab now?
[237:20.17]No, because he's right there.
[237:21.19]I just gotta run in and start swinging.
[237:25.43]Unless... We could do magic versus magic.
[237:28.55]I don't think that's the play here.
[237:47.30]I gotta get line of sight on that guy.
[237:56.76]Oh my god.
[237:57.76]This sucks God damn it I
[238:25.68]Damn, okay.
[238:34.10]I haven't... I got... Legendary chest.
[238:41.09]Ritual pot.
[238:45.74]What's that?
[238:49.37]Container required for crafting ritual pot items.
[238:54.61]Which, I don't know.
[238:55.41]I gotta, again, I have to sit down and figure out what the hell crafting even is.
[238:59.87]I've spent the entire game just not doing it at all and not paying any attention to it at all.
[239:06.14]It's locked.
[239:07.78]This...
[239:19.28]Yeah.
[239:20.94]You think I'm dumb.
[239:23.16]But you think I'm dumb?
[239:42.44]That's a boss right here.
[239:43.34]That guy was about to hit me with his book.
[239:56.70]Okay, fuck.
[239:57.40]This is like a leader.
[240:01.74]Nope.
[240:02.28]There's gotta be a bonfire right here, right?
[240:03.80]There always is.
[240:06.01]Is there not a bonfire?
[240:09.73]Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
[240:16.46]It's not a bonfire.
[240:17.44]There has to be.
[240:20.30]I'm not done looking around.
[240:39.11]Okay.
[240:56.06]Is there not actually a bonfire?
[241:08.26]Uh-oh.
[241:12.35]This is actually really, really bad news.
[241:14.79]If it's not, because this was a pain in the ass to get up here.
[241:24.61]I'm just going to have to run through every time.
[241:28.98]Really, though, I don't buy it.
[241:30.00]I don't buy it.
[241:35.19]I don't buy it.
[241:40.59]I, like, actually don't buy it.
[241:41.71]Because this is really far away.
[241:44.61]Yeah, this is, like, really far away.
[241:48.27]And this is the way to get over here.
[241:50.29]Remember that spot where I could drop down on the other side of the waterfall?
[241:57.87]I have a feeling that that opens the door back here.
[242:00.13]Remember the door?
[242:01.41]It was like, oh, this is shut.
[242:02.81]That one right there.
[242:05.65]I have to imagine that I could open that door.
[242:09.13]If I go on the other side of the waterfall.
[242:12.39]Which is precisely what I'm going to do.
[242:15.71]We want Gob.
[242:16.23]I don't know what Gob is.
[242:21.14]Yeah, I absolutely have to open that up from the other side.
[242:26.38]Everything is dead here, so I'll be fine.
[242:36.55]Make sure I didn't miss it somehow.
[242:38.29]Wait.
[242:42.95]This is not that bad.
[242:44.03]It is though.
[243:02.56]Ooh, more spells.
[243:09.60]Okay.
[243:10.54]I think I just have to run.
[243:11.86]I think I just have to run.
[243:12.90]You missed the wall.
[243:15.40]What?
[243:16.04]Oh, okay.
[243:20.57]What do you... Is that the wall?
[243:26.35]Wait, so that means there must be more.
[243:28.95]We're checking every bookcase.
[243:33.08]Illusory walls are confirmed to be in the game.
[243:36.90]It's been a while.
[243:40.23]It's actually been a long time.
[243:41.45]Come on.
[244:15.69]Up the stairs.
[244:21.18]Right here?
[244:24.54]Oh, I went through it though.
[244:27.08]This one.
[244:38.67]Up the stairs maybe?
[244:44.45]That's gonna be such a huge pain in the ass to run through those guys because the amount of times they cast.
[244:50.36]Come on.
[244:51.18]Let me be- Let this be right.
[244:55.30]Really?
[244:57.16]Come on.
[244:59.16]Yes!
[245:00.35]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[245:06.73]There's no bonfire in here.
[245:16.12]that's good what's in the chest what's that comet requires 52 intelligence to use fires a great magical comet can be cast repeatedly and while in motion charging enhances the potency
[245:44.79]52 intelligence.
[245:45.55]Good luck whenever getting there.
[245:49.38]Oh.
[245:50.18]There's a ladder.
[245:58.68]Is it even mathematically possible for me to get to 52?
[246:02.53]All the points I've been spending everywhere else.
[246:08.03]Okay.
[246:14.60]You don't just put this up for no reason.
[246:15.88]Why is this?
[246:16.24]This has to be up.
[246:17.14]There's no way this is not up here for no reason.
[246:24.51]It's impossible that there would be nothing here.
[246:26.07]Jump down.
[246:26.55]What?
[246:37.55]Other side?
[246:38.09]Wait, what?
[247:02.86]I don't guys I don't know what's down here.
[247:05.16]What's down here?
[247:07.77]Am I dead?
[247:16.89]What is that where what is that?
[247:28.20]Oh my god, it's a giga- this is- this could be huge.
[247:36.81]I hear a person behind me!
[247:39.53]Stupid little jello containers.
[247:41.59]Alright, don't die here.
[247:42.95]Don't die.
[247:43.67]Where am I?
[247:49.76]That's definitely a sorcery talisman.
[247:51.82]Absolutely.
[247:52.38]That is a sorcery talisman.
[247:58.65]Without a single doubt.
[248:04.99]They give a lot of souls.
[248:36.24]Alright, is there anything else in here?
[248:44.02]No bonfire though, but that... Let's take a look.
[248:48.46]Is this... Do I have one now?
[248:52.67]Oh my god.
[248:54.11]Finally.
[248:56.49]Finally.
[248:59.61]Raises the potency of sorceries.
[249:06.74]I lost max equipment load though.
[249:08.18]It doesn't seem like it really matters that much in this game.
[249:11.41]Because I'm not mid-rolling.
[249:15.03]I should be, shouldn't I?
[249:15.83]How forgiving is mid-rolling and fat-rolling now?
[249:31.17]Because I am well over 50%.
[249:32.61]Bat roll is 70%.
[249:35.07]You are mid-rolling.
[249:35.99]But mid-rolling was buffed.
[249:39.05]What does it look like if you're not mid-rolling?
[249:48.52]Huh.
[249:53.64]Interesting.
[249:54.15]Okay.
[249:59.74]I want the highest magic defense.
[250:09.49]Four, five, five, eight, six, eight.
[250:18.11]I really don't, I don't really even tell a difference.
[250:19.95]Maybe it's, I think the, the underneath the regular just on a naked roll.
[250:25.83]Maybe you go a little bit further.
[250:32.72]I don't know.
[250:34.78]Cool, nonetheless.
[250:38.72]It's the stamina difference.
[250:39.76]Oh.
[250:40.82]Alright, well, I wonder how much more potent these sorceries are.
[250:44.83]Because I need to go back to the bonfire.
[250:50.27]It looks... I guess you just have to run.
[250:52.97]I think you just have to run through, which is a huge pain in the ass, but it doesn't seem to be that far.
[250:58.25]Just gotta run.
[251:15.91]Are there more walls?
[251:18.63]Hit the crystal.
[251:22.11]We will in a minute.
[251:24.57]I'm putting point into intelligence.
[251:27.54]Alright.
[251:33.72]Well, I got to kill some people anyways.
[251:36.02]Let's see how much more damage my... Well, it's hard to tell on these guys, but...
[251:47.91]I need like 10,000.
[251:48.91]Oh hell yeah.
[251:52.55]That's a good drop.
[251:54.66]Mm-hmm.
[252:01.82]Magic defense.
[252:10.31]There's not a chance in hell that I don't need it here.
[252:23.21]Yeah, this room in particular.
[252:36.79]How am I supposed to run through this room?
[252:42.91]Just sprint by?
[252:45.91]Okay.
[253:09.55]I forgot about the pot.
[253:10.75]The pot is still here.
[253:11.59]I've got huge arms.
[253:23.46]I forgot.
[253:40.27]Alright, almost to 10,000.
[253:41.65]I think one more guy and that should do it.
[253:49.48]Okay.
[253:50.60]Somebody said, hit the crystal.
[253:52.28]Let's see what happens if I hit the crystal.
[254:17.14]Time to level up intelligence.
[254:19.44]You know that's what we're doing.
[254:21.15]Then... Boss time.
[254:23.73]I'm going to give it a try.
[254:25.41]No.
[254:26.85]Not boss time.
[254:29.29]We're going to level up.
[254:30.31]Then I'm going to go... How much is it to level up?
[254:32.75]Because I want to make sure I have enough to upgrade the weapon.
[254:34.31]9,500.
[254:39.82]Let me see how much it takes to...
[254:46.48]Do this.
[254:47.00]Oh, I'm here.
[254:47.58]Alright.
[254:48.22]Schoolhouse.
[254:49.91]Last room.
[254:56.45]Uh... Because I have enough stones to do the weapon again.
[255:01.79]I believe.
[255:12.50]When is Jeremy going to notice he has a health debuff?
[255:16.36]I do?
[255:18.72]What do you mean?
[255:20.93]Oh, it's Somber Smithing Stone 5.
[255:26.99]Not what I have.
[255:29.17]Well, never mind.
[255:41.17]Health debuff from getting hugged have to use the blessing to cure it.
[255:48.20]What?
[255:51.95]What do you mean?
[256:02.47]This?
[256:03.89]My health is the same.
[256:14.96]Go get hugged.
[256:22.23]Wait, did it work?
[256:25.85]I am pleased.
[256:26.65]Would you like me now?
[256:28.76]Yeah, okay.
[256:29.86]Come closer.
[256:37.16]Was it because she hugged me?
[256:44.23]You are so...
[256:50.97]I was known as a deathbed companion.
[256:55.55]Where I come from, after I received the warmth and lively vigor from a number of champions, I lay with the remains of an exalted noble.
[257:08.41]To grant him another chance at life.
[257:12.06]To do so is the purpose of my being.
[257:16.36]But before I could bear the need to new life, I was awakened by the guidance of Grace and chased from my birthplace.
[257:27.57]Pray.
[257:29.13]Be kind despite all that.
[257:32.53]I still wish to be a deathbed companion, so please let me hold you like this as often as it takes.
[257:42.56]Then good day to you.
[257:45.04]Okay.
[257:47.58]So I'm, I currently have like a little blessing curse thingy.
[257:54.60]Having the blessing in your inventory gives you a 5% debuff.
[257:57.26]It will wear off once you use the blessing.
[258:23.41]That is weird.
[258:24.19]Okay.
[258:24.37]I'm just... I don't... Wait for... That's weird.
[258:28.23]That's weird.
[258:28.69]Alright, we're gonna... We're gonna do intelligence, then we're gonna do, uh, vigor, and then mind.
[258:39.56]And I need to get dexterity up to, like, 25 as well.
[258:44.50]Okay.
[258:46.74]I have...
[258:50.30]For now, I'm going to keep my flasks the way they are, in case I need to do any sorceries.
[258:56.07]But, um, let's go.
[258:57.83]Let's see what happens here.
[259:10.30]Uh, let me see if I can just run by.
[259:24.44]Goodbye.
[259:27.38]Goodbye.
[259:28.18]It's not that bad of a run.
[259:35.22]Alright.
[259:36.78]Let's go.
[259:40.80]Red Wolf of Radagon.
[259:44.16]Double headphones for this.
[259:47.83]Oh, he's so susceptible to this weapon Oh
[260:39.30]Let's go.
[261:02.61]Shit!
[261:02.87]I almost had it first try.
[261:04.67]Damn it.
[261:05.75]Okay.
[261:06.01]Alright.
[261:06.37]Alright.
[261:06.65]Alright.
[261:08.67]I almost had it first try.
[261:14.27]Damn it.
[261:15.03]Oh well.
[261:17.05]This weapon is really good against this guy.
[261:22.79]I probably would have had it.
[261:24.10]The only problem was when he went to the back and started putting the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[261:29.00]I was kind of like, what does that do?
[261:30.38]I didn't know what was happening.
[261:41.69]I actually should probably just do health.
[261:44.01]And there's no... I mean, how am I going to cast a spell at this guy?
[261:46.09]There's no way.
[261:48.47]Alright, let's go.
[261:53.16]Reposition.
[261:53.76]Let's go.
[262:04.78]Okay, I got to get the timing on that.
[262:21.57]Shit.
[262:22.35]I didn't mean to press... I'm... Alright, alright, alright.
[262:23.99]I'm in.
[262:24.27]Like, get the fucking hand off the button.
[262:26.51]Like, you know when you just, like, kind of stay there, and, like, your hands are still on B, and you're just like, get... Get off!
[262:32.29]Get off of... Get the fuck off of B!
[262:34.04]Don't get greedy?
[262:41.00]No, I'll be good.
[262:46.02]Summon the little squirt guys.
[262:48.08]I don't think I need summons for this one.
[262:50.46]Again, I forgot to fucking put the flasks on.
[262:56.17]And I also probably shouldn't be wearing... Maybe I should, because of the magic damage.
[263:01.95]Oh, this guy's not too bad.
[263:05.71]Unless there's like a phase two after this, which there very well might be.
[263:09.89]Let's just see what happens.
[263:10.71]Alright.
[263:12.42]Focus!
[263:21.04]Okay.
[263:22.88]The delay on those things is a lot longer than I think it is.
[263:28.20]It takes like about three full seconds.
[263:30.75]Puts them down and they sit there like one, two, three, then they go.
[263:34.73]Okay.
[263:35.89]Okay.
[263:52.08]What does the fox say on a 10-hour loop while you fight this?
[264:04.63]Okay.
[264:06.33]I've kind of gotten unlucky.
[264:07.27]He's done that, like, twice in a row now.
[264:08.64]Alright, I've got to get in close.
[264:09.56]Okay.
[264:30.80]Damn.
[264:34.09]Holy shit.
[264:34.73]I kind of hope I... Too bad I didn't beat him first try.
[264:37.13]This guy's actually kind of difficult.
[264:41.43]Almost had it.
[264:48.62]Why is the first try always the best?
[264:50.36]Because the first try is always the best.
[264:52.32]Because you always go in there, and you're just like, I don't give a shit.
[264:55.60]I have no idea what the fuck is happening.
[264:58.32]And you just let your body just do it, and not your brain.
[265:02.46]Problem is now, after being in there a couple times, my brain has figured out what he's doing, and my brain is going, Jeremy, he's got that move, you know, and he's gonna use it on you.
[265:13.10]You gotta be careful.
[265:14.88]He's got those moves.
[265:15.98]You know what they do.
[265:18.26]I- I gotta- I'm- Alright, I'm turning my brain off.
[265:49.46]Jesus Christ.
[265:53.76]Especially when he dashes across the road and then the camera changes, so I can't see them.
[265:57.42]There's a battle mage set right outside the door?
[266:03.69]Huh?
[266:21.54]Don't tell him that!
[266:23.98]I thought I've explored every area!
[266:29.83]Please, for the love of God... Relax, I'm fine!
[266:34.61]What do you mean there's a battle mage set right outside the door?
[266:50.00]I don't need it.
[266:51.06]I don't need it.
[266:51.44]I can get it.
[266:52.66]I gotta die like 30,000 more times.
[267:23.87]shit in my pants oh my god he's fast okay I keep so when he when he okay he has like two distinct move sets here he has one where he just
[267:36.61]his mouth but then sometimes he'll go sword and it's it's hard to I'm trying to figure out when uh like when he puts his mouth up he's gonna put the sword in his hand and you gotta wait he's got a really really fast uh just like little
[268:01.79]This weapon is... I gotta keep this weapon on, though, because it's definitely the best thing that I have against him.
[268:13.05]Alright, come on, dude.
[268:13.87]Let's go.
[268:33.06]Damn it, man!
[268:34.32]Fuck you, fuck you!
[269:19.91]Oi!
[269:50.40]I panicked so hard on that last one.
[269:55.50]I was so scared.
[269:56.52]I just held down the dodge button.
[270:00.66]When he casted the fucking blue shit, I was like, fuck, man, he's going to come in.
[270:04.52]And I thought there was one more that didn't shoot yet.
[270:07.74]Damn.
[270:13.08]I thought there was one more that didn't shoot.
[270:14.71]That's why I was like, when is it going to fucking fire?
[270:19.59]I got too cocky?
[270:20.29]No, you gotta be cocky.
[270:21.29]That's how you beat this shit.
[270:26.61]Nobody ever beat a Dark Souls FromSoftware game boss going... I'm not sure if I should... I don't... No, somebody else... No, you gotta get in there and... I don't even need it.
[270:42.02]Let's go.
[271:03.05]So you mean like what how come those didn't fire that's what happened last time they stuck in the wall I
[271:57.02]That move sucks!
[271:58.82]That move sucks!
[272:07.07]There's almost no delay on that move.
[272:10.98]I gotta dodge to the right.
[272:12.28]Oh, man.
[272:13.88]Damn.
[272:16.80]Sometimes... Okay, so when he goes like this... When he goes like... Oh, that move is so hard to fucking predict.
[272:24.81]I gotta start dodging to the right.
[272:25.85]Because it's so quick.
[272:29.77]It's just like a wham!
[272:32.90]There's not much any... There's no time.
[272:36.52]I almost had him too.
[272:37.36]It's just like sometimes those things don't fire.
[272:40.26]I think they get like stuck behind a bookcase or something.
[272:43.84]But when you hear him be like, here it comes.
[272:45.66]It's almost like, why have they not fired yet?
[272:48.97]It's kind of, it fucks you up.
[272:53.89]Sometimes he'll stagger them out.
[272:55.85]Oh, this guy.
[272:56.73]You motherfucker.
[273:02.29]I'll get him.
[273:11.82]Bad start.
[273:13.35]I thought he was going to do the other move.
[273:32.10]God damn it.
[273:34.20]Oh, because like... There's such a small amount of time.
[273:38.78]Because those things are staggered, but if you dodge, you're probably going to get hit by the magic.
[273:45.83]Fuck.
[273:53.93]He kind of attacks in like a half second or like a two-tenths of a second either faster or slower than those things come out.
[274:01.92]So I wonder if you just run.
[274:04.98]I think you just run.
[274:06.34]I don't think you dodge.
[274:07.32]I just think you actually just run to like the left or the right.
[274:10.06]Just run away.
[274:12.93]I don't think you dodge those.
[274:14.15]I think you just run.
[274:15.09]Try it.
[274:25.61]That's not going to happen.
[274:29.81]That's not going to happen.
[274:39.91]Okay, so it might work sometimes, but that was one of the times when he was like, hey, I know you're across the whole level here, but I'd like to just in a tenth of a second be in your face and bite your throat.
[274:52.84]That's great.
[274:54.94]Why am I getting worse?
[274:56.16]I am testing out theories.
[275:02.70]Testing out theories.
[275:08.55]I'm going to try running and that guy for fucking five minutes.
[275:45.04]Let's go.
[276:16.00]OH YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
[276:17.14]STOP WITH THIS!
[276:30.16]3D MOTHERFUCKER!
[277:01.77]How do I?
[277:02.49]Fucking God.
[277:13.10]That stupid thing.
[277:15.58]Did you see right before he came in?
[277:17.22]Right before I screamed?
[277:28.62]Right before I screamed.
[277:32.70]He was the greedy one, not me.
[277:38.02]And you know what else?
[277:39.31]Just unbind it.
[277:39.97]I don't care.
[277:40.43]I'm not stealthing ever again.
[277:42.25]Like, what the fuck is the point?
[277:43.13]It doesn't do anything anyways.
[277:44.69]Let's go.
[278:17.06]Not a chance in hell, man.
[278:17.98]Not a chance in hell.
[278:18.50]Get me the fuck away from that.
[278:27.93]We haven't seen that move in five, ten attempts.
[278:35.49]Stupid fucking crouch.
[278:52.23]You literally killed him the first try.
[278:53.71]Okay, if I bind Crouch again, I'd just leave it unbound the whole game.
[279:01.62]Like, there's actually literally not a single reason to have it bound.
[279:05.32]Not one solitary reason to use it in the whole game.
[279:08.82]I'm never binding it again.
[279:09.60]Okay.
[279:25.93]He would have been dead.
[279:29.97]Crouch, crouch, crouch.
[279:32.95]He was dead too.
[279:34.19]And like, I just couldn't fucking move.
[279:43.71]Just wait.
[279:44.13]Just wait till you get this fucking game or your goddamn PlayStation 3, whatever the hell it is.
[279:48.59]What if a console exists?
[279:50.32]Just wait till you crouch accidentally and you get killed.
[279:53.28]And then I want to see your fucking 10-page essay about how much you can't believe it's in the game.
[279:58.90]Okay.
[280:05.45]Okay.
[280:18.61]Ah!
[281:15.27]Thank you.
[281:34.24]What the fuck are you talking about?
[281:36.61]What?
[281:42.53]Did he hit- what did he hit me with?
[281:43.65]The very end of that?
[281:45.01]At the very fucking end?
[281:45.89]Right in the tiny little backswing?
[281:48.62]What is it, Jerm?
[281:53.22]Are you using an Xbox controller?
[281:54.50]It's not- it's not the game's fault.
[281:58.31]Are you telling me that, like, 7 million people that have to play this on Xbox should just buy a new console?
[282:06.93]Now, I could have chosen, but I like the Xbox controller.
[282:11.33]I like the Xbox controller because it's big for my big-ass hands!
[282:17.40]I can't use the PlayStation 4 controller because my thumbs knock into each other!
[282:23.76]Quiet.
[282:34.22]you
[283:18.78]He does a third chain!
[284:01.83]Unbind that shit and never bind it ever again.
[284:16.79]I'm fucking sweating.
[284:21.57]Alright, that was fun.
[284:29.92]Yeah, I don't... I just really shouldn't even bind it.
[284:32.86]Hmm.
[284:34.40]I have an idea.
[284:34.84]Here we go.
[284:36.10]You ready?
[284:37.94]Here's my idea.
[284:40.39]My idea... This might not be... You can't call the map in combat, right?
[285:00.29]What if I made select crouch and left stick the map?
[285:06.45]I wonder if that's a good idea.
[285:08.23]No, that would fuck with me in the regular game.
[285:13.23]Switch the map and crouch?
[285:14.84]I mean, I'll try it, maybe.
[285:16.04]Let's see.
[285:16.92]I might just be running away from, like, enemies and, like, I'll open the map.
[285:26.73]Select is the alt menu, yeah.
[285:28.17]What about, like... I wish I could do, like, a combo or something.
[285:37.23]I just wish it was hold.
[285:38.97]It's the easiest way to fix that problem.
[285:40.63]It's just press and stick, hold for one second, you crouch.
[285:43.23]Nobody is crouching during any fight.
[285:45.28]It's like something you do to sneak around.
[285:46.80]Alright, I want to do health.
[285:55.91]And we'll go from there.
[286:01.33]We need more buttons.
[286:03.39]Well, that's like the Red Dead way to do it, right?
[286:05.97]To like pick up items.
[286:06.93]There were things tied to the same button, right?
[286:11.95]But you had to hold it.
[286:14.07]And I complained about that too.
[286:17.16]You're the only one with this problem?
[286:18.16]I'm not.
[286:19.32]I've seen at least three or four other streamers talk about this exact issue.
[286:24.56]And other players.
[286:25.72]I've been scouring the forums.
[286:30.11]I've been scouring the forums.
[286:32.76]Okay, so what do I want to do?
[286:33.66]Let's do this again.
[286:44.37]That is a brilliant idea, but I don't think I can do it.
[286:50.44]That's absolutely brilliant.
[286:51.72]I don't think it's going to work.
[286:54.14]Nope, I can't do keyboard.
[286:56.36]That's annoying.
[287:00.82]I cannot do a combo.
[287:04.93]I mean, what?
[287:05.55]Hold on.
[287:05.89]What is it?
[287:06.17]It's X?
[287:07.61]And I just press... I hate this fucking game.
[287:11.02]I... God damn it.
[287:12.00]Give me a break.
[287:12.74]You gotta be kidding me.
[287:30.49]Problem is officially... Officially fixed.
[287:41.63]Let's go.
[287:43.71]I do want to go back because I want to check out that wheel.
[287:46.31]This is going to the cringe collection.
[287:52.52]I want to go to the wheel.
[287:53.68]Where's the wheel?
[288:00.68]Not the church.
[288:01.30]Where is it?
[288:01.62]Like right here?
[288:03.20]Like right here, right?
[288:08.36]How did that fix it?
[288:09.42]Because I'm pressing X on the keyboard...
[288:13.76]It's unbound alright Attention all players that have the problem of accidentally crouching all the time a very simple solution X on your keyboard if you're playing on PC is bound to crouch You can safely unbind left stick crouch and just hit X when you want to crouch around Let this be a public service announcement to you all Let's go
[288:46.32]Alright, where's the wheel?
[288:51.64]It's outside here, right?
[288:58.95]If you weren't dodging around like you're moving away from a moving car, you'd be fine.
[289:04.29]This is one of the most intense video games that's available for you to play.
[289:11.09]Of course people are going to get intense and grip their controllers harder and move around faster and...
[289:16.78]I'm not playing Mario Paint, like I said last night.
[289:18.96]Alright, where's the wheel?
[289:28.61]Oh, this is wrong.
[289:36.63]I'm gonna just kill this fucking idiot.
[289:37.97]Okay, where... I should've marked it.
[289:48.39]Graveyard.
[289:49.05]Yeah, that was up in there, right?
[290:01.54]Look, just because I have an intensified gamer grip does not mean that I should have to suffer because it's bound to the same button that is walk.
[290:17.76]Where is it here?
[290:23.10]I should have marked it.
[290:23.76]I don't remember which one it is.
[290:25.24]It's one of these.
[290:26.20]A parlor?
[290:29.71]Right here?
[290:30.57]On gate?
[290:37.95]I like this intense Jerma.
[290:41.69]No, it's not that one.
[290:45.03]Is it actually the classroom?
[290:46.07]Just walk out of the classroom?
[290:48.66]I don't remember.
[290:49.08]Isn't this a cool house?
[290:55.46]What do I do about this very important crouch issue if I'm playing on a PS4?
[291:01.13]I can't help you there.
[291:01.75]What am I doing?
[291:15.14]got a gorilla grip I'm just saying I it like that going from okay listen to me I'm going to it's time for the guy to spam the emote let's see the emote spam the emote there is such a huge difference when you're playing a game like this but when you are when you are moving at a speed that you know how many like nauticals per second whatever it is
[291:38.89]When it changes to this, that slight change is enough for you that it's such a drastic change.
[291:47.41]Because your muscle memory is wrong.
[292:00.68]Okay.
[292:01.56]So where is it?
[292:02.86]Down here or is it over here?
[292:03.88]There was a way I could drop down.
[292:23.70]I'm so glad that that is a complete solution, though.
[292:26.54]That is an absolute 100% solution on PC.
[292:29.04]Perfect.
[292:32.42]Where was that other... I swear, it was like a drop down.
[292:36.80]Where was it?
[292:41.00]Remember I was looking at it and I was going, oh, I can go down there.
[292:51.60]Do I just have to ride the thing down?
[292:58.24]I swear, where was it?
[293:06.74]Don't tell him.
[293:08.82]If only there were platforms on the wheel.
[293:11.71]I know, yeah, but I mean, I thought there was another way to do this.
[293:14.77]I thought there was another thing to drop on.
[293:30.16]When do I get off?
[293:36.69]When am I supposed to get off?
[293:38.57]Oh shit, I was supposed to get off right there.
[293:42.39]Oh no, can I jump on anything?
[293:44.99]Where's this taking me?
[293:45.71]Oh, I'm alive.
[293:55.84]What the fuck is this?
[294:04.27]Holy shit, that hurt.
[294:07.81]Wow!
[294:08.19]Holy shit!
[294:19.94]There's so many of these little fireflies down here.
[294:21.62]Alright, you gotta dodge through them.
[294:41.47]What is that?
[294:49.55]Are you done?
[295:10.91]It's not that bad.
[295:27.68]This is a shitload of health.
[295:28.42]Alright.
[295:36.37]Drop anything?
[295:40.33]Oh, but I can really... Oh, wow.
[295:42.11]This is cool.
[295:42.63]Okay.
[295:42.95]Look at all these fireflies.
[295:47.23]Firefly city down here.
[295:53.72]Is he ever going to use magic?
[295:57.22]I am.
[296:00.16]Look.
[296:01.40]Look.
[296:03.18]His weapon scales with magic.
[296:13.81]Long tail cat talisman.
[296:22.87]You're immune to fall damage.
[296:31.08]That's fucking huge.
[296:34.86]How much health does that give though?
[296:37.90]Raises max HP.
[296:41.48]Always so hard.
[296:42.04]Okay, so this is at the point.
[296:44.16]I'm going to put it right at the tip of the crystal right there.
[296:46.56]Right at the tip of that crystal.
[296:49.04]How much do I lose?
[296:54.18]Hmm.
[296:55.10]I mean, that's kind of significant.
[296:56.16]It's not that big of a deal, but... Alright.
[296:59.57]No more fall jokes.
[297:01.65]Sad.
[297:09.51]It's like 7%.
[297:10.18]It actually is a lot.
[297:21.16]Okay, so that's what's down here.
[297:22.40]Anything else down here?
[297:30.57]This is so red.
[297:36.28]Greedy motherfucker!
[297:38.99]Greedy motherfucker!
[297:40.99]Let's stick, let's stick, let's stick, let's stick!
[297:43.74]Maybe that's why I'm so red.
[297:44.92]I don't think that- Wait, what's this?
[298:14.12]Wait, can I test it?
[298:25.41]Huh?
[298:29.25]I believe I just fell off of a cliff.
[298:39.38]excuse me stop that's not funny do you see the weapon the item that I have equipped right now renders the wearer immune to fall damage and I I jump off to test to see if it works and I'm not immune to fall damage excuse me that's that's a scam
[299:17.65]Where are my souls?
[299:46.12]Maybe if it's too far, it doesn't matter.
[299:48.15]That's not even worth putting on then.
[299:56.01]It's down further.
[299:56.57]Yeah, I just seemed to be missing it.
[300:00.39]That's not worth putting on because all the times that you care about falling in these games is if you die by falling in these games.
[300:09.21]Nobody cares about falling a little bit and like... I took like 30% damage.
[300:23.29]Where's this magical set that you guys told me was down here?
[300:32.37]Right there.
[300:32.91]Okay, so how do I get up there?
[300:36.97]Oh, the mechanical thing is back.
[300:42.33]Where are my souls?
[300:43.16]Where are they?
[300:47.42]Are they up on the... Oh, they're up on the goddamn cliff.
[301:01.11]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[301:02.09]There's a place I can run up.
[301:04.40]Where is it?
[301:04.72]Right there.
[301:14.38]That thing is horrifying.
[301:19.23]Alright, so... Okay.
[301:26.18]So how do I get over there?
[301:27.72]I don't understand.
[301:33.78]How do I get over there?
[301:38.50]Um... Oh, where do I go from here?
[301:43.42]Where do I go from here?
[301:46.89]Thank fucking God.
[301:47.99]Okay.
[301:50.31]Um... How do I get over there?
[301:53.57]Like that house is.
[301:57.16]It's like a weird house in the distance.
[302:00.90]Where was that?
[302:09.77]I gotta see, okay, is there another ledge I can jump to?
[302:12.19]Is it up there?
[302:52.94]I'm gonna sell this to a fucking vendor.
[302:54.30]That wasn't even that far.
[303:00.34]Okay, so I gotta go up all the way.
[303:12.33]What is up there?
[303:18.39]Oh dude, check this out.
[303:24.86]Watch this.
[303:30.41]Hold the rune.
[303:43.22]Hell yeah.
[303:44.40]I could have just walked up there.
[304:10.61]Okay, so this is the first wheel.
[304:12.61]I gotta go all the way up on the second wheel.
[304:14.95]Do I have that?
[304:17.25]Am I understanding that correctly?
[304:21.06]I'm gonna get my souls, which are on a ledge over here.
[304:24.52]Oh, they're right there, right?
[304:44.81]Where do I go?
[304:49.01]Is this the right way?
[304:53.97]That just makes me back up that way.
[304:55.85]Should I go all the way up that way?
[304:57.50]I'm going to get all the way up.
[305:07.66]Alright.
[305:12.03]Alright.
[305:18.19]And then, this will go all the way up to the top of this.
[305:23.03]Eh?
[305:25.73]Eh?
[305:32.00]She gets me here.
[305:34.10]Which... No, I'm... No, this is back up where this guy was.
[305:42.28]Is it even higher?
[305:43.02]It gets even higher.
[306:11.02]Huh?
[306:11.80]Wait, I'm back at the top.
[306:15.89]Where is this thing?
[306:17.31]I've been all the way to the bottom.
[306:18.57]I've been all the way to the top.
[306:20.95]You guys said there's like a super awesome magical item on the wheel?
[306:24.63]Where am I going?
[306:28.25]In this foggy ass place.
[306:33.21]Oh, down the wheel there's a ledge.
[306:35.29]Yeah, but there's... Wait, the ledges I just jumped off onto?
[306:39.79]Isn't that taking me back around?
[306:47.66]A ledge.
[306:48.24]There's a ledge.
[306:50.56]You mean this ledge here.
[306:52.32]You're talking about right here.
[306:53.04]You're talking about right there?
[306:56.02]You're talking about right there.
[306:56.94]You're talking about right here, and then I run this way.
[307:00.36]That was so fucking... Holy shit.
[307:02.02]Okay, I'm fine.
[307:03.45]And then you talk about this way, but I feel like... Isn't this the same place where I just was?
[307:11.31]Oh, god damn it.
[307:12.45]Honestly, I've been here like three times.
[307:13.53]I didn't realize... Whatever.
[307:22.63]Oh my god, you piece of shit.
[307:23.84]Get away from me.
[307:41.95]You do two of those?
[307:42.78]You're out of your league!
[307:58.19]No, just kill, just kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[308:03.23]What are you doing over here?
[308:14.83]Are you a Disney Channel bully?
[308:22.01]God damn it, you can't do that.
[308:36.01]Or, like, a Sonic character.
[308:37.59]Ooh, it's those guys.
[308:42.29]Okay.
[308:44.89]That's where that is.
[308:45.85]So now, this is not what you were talking about, though.
[308:47.96]There's more?
[308:52.46]I gotta jump off the ledge?
[308:57.52]What, you mean there's more?
[309:02.83]Down there?
[309:03.33]Yeah.
[309:23.58]I don't think I can make it to there.
[309:32.13]I wonder, can I jump from here to there?
[309:34.11]Maybe not.
[309:36.29]It might be possible.
[309:37.17]I don't think so.
[309:37.83]I forgot about the jump.
[309:41.66]Jump invisible platform ahead.
[309:43.06]Climb up the pink crystals to the house if we go down there.
[309:49.02]That's what I mean.
[309:50.26]I wonder if I can jump from here.
[309:55.25]Is there something I can jump onto from here, like with a running jump?
[309:58.77]Try it.
[309:59.05]Dead.
[310:15.82]Gotta be another way to get up there.
[310:23.92]Here we go.
[310:25.22]Oh, hell yeah.
[310:33.96]Lost Ashes of War.
[310:35.32]Nice.
[310:41.98]What do those do?
[310:42.48]E.
[310:54.43]Used to duplicate an Ash of War.
[310:56.15]So I can put it in two different items.
[311:02.07]That's still not what you guys are talking about.
[311:03.85]Alright, let me take a look here.
[311:05.97]You're talking about that ledge right there?
[311:11.48]It's the only other ledge that I've seen.
[311:12.88]Is that the one?
[311:14.60]Okay.
[311:17.18]So I gotta get... When you're going down, it's that crystal right there.
[311:29.68]I've never played this.
[311:34.45]Uh, I cannot call the boat.
[311:36.65]Okay, we came all the way over here.
[311:38.81]Congratulations.
[312:01.31]A little bit higher, but I could get on this.
[312:03.67]I was seeing what was here.
[312:04.43]I was seeing what was here.
[312:07.97]Relax.
[312:09.87]I was seeing what was here.
[312:12.21]There's another one right next to it.
[312:29.14]Dude, what the fuck?
[312:33.61]Really?
[312:36.75]What?
[312:41.14]It's higher than this?
[312:44.26]I'm getting fucked with.
[312:47.08]There's nothing else here.
[312:48.92]Where is this magical ledge?
[312:50.88]You guys, I've been fucking with you for like 30 minutes.
[312:54.89]I think you guys, have you guys actually just been messing with me?
[313:00.03]Don't even tell me you've actually just been messing with me.
[313:02.69]You might have been.
[313:11.51]No way, it's higher?
[313:12.63]Is it on the same side?
[313:35.34]No, that's not it.
[313:36.12]That's where... That's what the... I got... I just was fighting people there.
[313:40.02]The school room.
[313:40.86]Go inside the left room where there's a balcony.
[313:42.42]Jump to the far left side of the balcony.
[313:48.69]Okay, I don't know where...
[314:16.92]Stop telling me to get on the elevator!
[314:38.73]Okay.
[315:17.70]I have to jump on the ledge off the elevator?
[315:20.14]It was by the elevator.
[315:24.46]Come on!
[315:25.16]I'm gonna look so cool!
[315:54.87]Let's fucking go.
[315:58.71]Now I look really cool.
[316:18.08]I look so- I look sick.
[316:19.48]Look at how cool this looks.
[316:22.02]Alright, for all the haters, I'll take the helmet off.
[316:31.60]Not even a thank you.
[316:32.62]Thank you for... Now he actually is Captain Hook.
[316:42.57]Thank you for telling me where that was.
[316:45.27]Although, if you remember, I would like you to rewind when I looked over here and I said, There's a ledge down there.
[316:49.70]I could probably jump onto that.
[316:51.80]And then a million screaming haters were saying, Get on the elevator!
[316:56.24]Dude, up the elevator!
[316:57.54]Look over at the elevator!
[316:58.62]Get on the elevator!
[316:59.30]A million screaming haters...
[317:03.17]How do I get out of here?
[317:04.57]Is there anything else I can do here?
[317:17.87]What about down there?
[317:19.97]Oh, look at that.
[317:23.23]Facts.
[317:24.90]I think down there is something cool down there.
[317:27.66]Facts.
[317:34.03]Now let's teleport up.
[317:38.09]So.
[317:39.23]Uh.
[317:46.71]Uh.
[317:49.23]So I killed the boss here.
[317:50.87]What did I get?
[317:55.18]Oh my god.
[317:56.22]What the fuck just happened?
[318:01.54]Jesus.
[318:07.06]My microphone stand just, like, broke.
[318:16.52]Hold on, I'll mute this.
[318:33.39]That was weird.
[318:34.13]Yeah, my, like, thing just popped off.
[318:38.35]Still another boss here.
[318:39.21]Yeah, let me... I gotta keep going this way.
[318:44.31]I like it with the helmet on.
[318:47.15]Alright.
[318:47.99]Uh, cool.
[318:48.37]Did everything I needed to do.
[318:52.21]We're blessed here.
[318:52.88]Go through the door.
[318:53.54]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[318:55.46]I'm ready.
[319:02.20]Although, do I have any crunchies?
[319:03.60]Because I probably need... I don't, so I have to be careful.
[319:10.59]Is there another boss like right now I need the souls.
[319:23.69]I have to go kill these crabs I need 10,000
[319:40.35]10,000.
[319:40.71]I'll be happy.
[319:53.76]I need people here to get souls.
[320:02.15]Okay.
[320:05.67]The tail hit me with that.
[320:06.57]Another one of these mechanical people.
[320:16.83]Are you susceptible to magic?
[320:20.20]Probably not, right?
[320:21.18]Get away from me.
[320:29.59]Oh, you got me.
[320:30.25]Oh, no.
[320:48.27]Whatever.
[320:51.68]I'm not gonna get mad.
[320:58.80]That was... That was terrifying.
[321:15.19]I got two of these now.
[321:18.58]Which wasn't there... Okay, after Castle Skip, Foggy Door needs a key.
[321:28.70]Remember that?
[321:29.80]I gotta remember where that was.
[321:30.74]But there was a little dungeon I could go in.
[321:35.52]Okay.
[321:52.02]He's just killing everything.
[321:58.26]Just kill everything.
[322:03.08]That's fine.
[322:04.42]Shit, dude.
[322:05.30]What in the name of God are you doing?
[322:07.69]Alright, I gotta level up.
[322:22.82]I think I should have enough.
[322:35.09]200 more, and what am I going to put it into?
[322:37.10]Mind, probably?
[322:40.18]No, Dexterity.
[322:42.96]I have not put a point in Dexterity in a long time.
[322:55.54]Okay, one more for good luck.
[323:01.24]Next.
[323:01.56]Daily message to see if you've gone insane.
[323:14.89]I think I'm doing okay.
[323:23.90]What's the damage on this thing now?
[323:26.84]39 plus 28.
[323:28.20]139 plus 26.
[323:33.61]Okay.
[323:34.87]Continue.
[323:35.37]Now I'm not terrified of dying anywhere.
[323:37.23]So let me go up here first.
[323:41.48]There's quite a few things to see here.
[323:43.34]I think.
[324:09.49]Get out of the way.
[324:14.45]Another cracked pot.
[324:16.45]Which I haven't used yet.
[324:19.88]Living Joshod.
[324:24.02]Fun to say those words.
[324:28.53]Nothing else, right?
[324:32.07]Doesn't look like it.
[324:38.33]Uh, let me kill this guy out here.
[324:40.83]This thing out here.
[324:41.73]Wait.
[324:42.45]Okay.
[324:51.02]Holy shit.
[324:52.08]I can see you guys.
[325:00.39]Dude, how- It's- fucking aim?
[325:07.81]What is this aim?
[325:12.93]How are you shooting me through that?
[325:15.38]What a punk.
[325:16.58]Seriously, what a punk.
[325:35.22]Flintstone Wetblade.
[325:39.88]Dude.
[325:40.06]Can you stop just raining hell for a second?
[325:45.70]How many people are standing over here?
[326:00.02]This is like a thousand people.
[326:15.48]The fall was actually pretty good.
[326:24.92]Rune Fragment, Rune Fragment.
[326:25.98]Alright.
[326:27.66]Grab this guy too.
[326:37.09]You guys up here.
[326:43.89]I'm literally right next to me.
[326:46.10]Aristocrat?
[326:47.04]Garb?
[326:47.20]Alright, there's an Aristocrat, um, garb.
[326:52.66]For me, you got invaded by a Burger King.
[326:54.30]I don't think this is even what you said.
[327:00.64]Outmagicked by the Burger King guy.
[327:02.90]I'm fine!
[327:06.44]I don't know why that's making me mad.
[327:10.63]It's pissing me off.
[327:11.95]Why is that making me so angry?
[327:13.21]That's funny.
[327:13.95]I'm like pissed that you said that.
[327:18.31]Okay.
[327:32.22]I wonder if I can cheese this and just sit on the balcony.
[327:35.20]Probably can.
[327:58.50]Rune.
[328:01.96]This song sounds like it's from Majora's Mask.
[328:04.73]So far I've really liked the music.
[328:05.73]It's been really good.
[328:15.96]Doesn't open on this side.
[328:20.88]Really.
[328:33.19]That's a good move.
[328:33.93]I like it.
[328:35.11]It's staying on the bar.
[328:36.23]I'm not taking it off.
[328:43.78]Okay.
[328:46.76]I guess that's a decent skip to just run in here.
[328:51.74]Cool.
[328:56.94]Apologize to Burger King.
[328:59.96]What?
[329:05.58]Alright, but... I don't... Okay, maybe I'll go the other way first.
[329:13.71]I gotta kill this guy.
[329:17.67]It's time for a cheese ball incorporated.
[329:37.07]Hello, welcome to Cheeseball Incorporated.
[329:38.90]Welcome to the first meeting.
[330:23.29]Crap.
[330:24.09]Crap.
[330:46.51]Okay, let's explore over here for a minute.
[330:55.40]I did not get a chance to look over here.
[330:56.52]I got the thing in the fountain.
[331:04.74]What about this?
[331:13.65]Lugary wall.
[331:14.31]Come on, really?
[331:18.93]You're getting minus karma.
[331:22.10]Oh, how come my head doesn't hurt?
[331:23.70]Um, it kind of does.
[331:52.47]Does a lot of damage to crabs.
[331:58.36]What is that bar?
[331:59.18]Is it sleep?
[332:16.61]Whoa, move!
[332:25.73]Crab eggs.
[332:29.07]What's wrong with this guy?
[332:29.69]What was that?
[332:34.58]What was wrong with that guy?
[332:36.00]Why was he doing that?
[332:45.00]It was infected with sleep.
[332:46.73]Ah, okay.
[332:47.35]I get it.
[332:48.11]I get it.
[332:54.35]Where did that crab even come from?
[333:04.47]Up in this way.
[333:09.46]See an item over on the ledge.
[333:12.40]Very interested in.
[333:13.20]There's some scary sounds coming from over here.
[333:31.64]Golden seed.
[333:32.32]I probably need two at least.
[333:48.07]How about over here?
[333:49.93]There's a balcony that goes up that way too.
[333:52.99]Check over here.
[333:57.31]I don't think you're high enough for this next area.
[334:01.10]Do you mean like... What do you mean by that?
[334:11.11]I get to be the Burger King now.
[334:19.89]Increases intelligence?
[334:27.01]Wait, increases intelligence with the detriment of stamina?
[334:38.96]I have 27 intelligence now.
[334:40.78]I actually am Burger King.
[334:49.07]So, how much did my... So my stamina is 91 now.
[334:51.83]That's actually kind of bad.
[334:52.83]Fog, do the dance.
[335:11.40]Alright, let's keep going.
[335:12.76]I'll keep it on for now.
[335:13.54]If the stamina is too much of a problem, I'll pick it up.
[335:16.30]Yeah, yeah, okay.
[335:33.35]Alright.
[335:33.69]Alright.
[335:43.56]Why am I sleeping?
[335:44.20]I have resistance to sleep because I have so much intelligence.
[336:07.61]That was pretty good timing, I will say.
[336:25.89]Whoa, cool.
[336:26.69]Alright, I can get that in a minute.
[336:29.25]So many little trinkets and little things to do.
[336:32.11]This game is so cool.
[336:34.67]Alright, where's my stuff?
[336:35.77]Over here?
[336:37.44]This way.
[336:42.60]You two fight each other.
[336:49.77]Alright, time to kill this guy.
[336:51.47]I'm gonna do a super Q. Ready?
[337:01.14]Oh, I fell asleep.
[337:07.07]I don't understand what it even does.
[337:08.23]I woke right up.
[337:27.80]Go talk to the sorcerer about the gate key.
[337:30.98]Yeah, I am, but I need to make sure I can get back in here.
[337:34.78]I'm afraid of going to talk to that guy.
[337:36.58]Because he'll take the key or something, and then I can't get back in here, which would be a disaster.
[337:41.92]It would be horrible.
[337:42.80]Alright, let me try to get this item over here.
[337:45.98]Okay.
[337:56.63]You got me?
[337:57.73]Really?
[337:58.05]You just fish hooked me.
[338:08.18]Alright, let's get it.
[338:19.07]Oh, good thing I decided to get that item.
[338:23.15]Oh shit.
[338:37.49]How do I do this?
[338:53.16]There's an item down there too.
[339:12.91]Am I safe here?
[339:44.42]It passes me so many times!
[339:50.84]I was so far away!
[339:52.46]I was so far away!
[339:58.33]It didn't hit me the other times.
[340:02.11]It must roll a certain way.
[340:03.43]Hold on.
[340:03.79]Let me go look.
[340:07.37]Shit.
[340:08.87]I definitely want whatever that is, so I'm gonna get it.
[340:12.53]Hmm.
[340:20.27]It must be a different way I can go.
[340:28.18]The ball looks like it has a trajectory, right?
[340:30.60]It rolls that way and then curves this way.
[340:40.35]Okay, it bounces against this wall.
[340:44.01]Let me see, where does that bounce?
[340:46.33]I'm safe right here.
[340:52.30]I'm safe right here.
[340:54.10]So from here, how do I get down there?
[340:56.82]How do I go that way?
[341:02.82]I'm safe right here.
[341:05.10]I think.
[341:09.88]I looked like I was safe right here.
[341:16.32]That's the exact one that I need to upgrade this weapon.
[341:24.49]yeah just run up I can I just have to just weave hold on let's wait should be able to get in without too much trouble I hope
[341:54.21]A teleporter.
[341:58.43]There's a port here.
[341:59.39]I don't want to take this.
[342:05.72]No, I don't want to take that right now.
[342:07.12]Let me see if there's a bonfire here.
[342:12.28]I want to be able to come back.
[342:15.37]Moongrum Carrion Knight.
[342:24.63]He just parried me, you fucking weirdo.
[342:43.82]What are you thinking?
[342:47.04]Are you dumb?
[342:58.58]Wait, why does he parry?
[343:00.95]I'm alive.
[343:04.49]Like, really?
[343:05.51]That's so... Fuck that.
[343:16.06]Now, look at how far away I am, too.
[343:17.88]That's such a pain in the absolute dick.
[343:22.44]I gotta run up this stupid thing again.
[343:24.04]That guy, I'm so pissed.
[343:25.84]That guy's dead.
[343:27.24]Yeah, guess what?
[343:27.76]I can do that too, you know.
[343:31.22]Oh, I'm gonna fucking pull his ass.
[343:32.86]If I need to use it, I will.
[343:58.39]it's so embarrassing when you get parried especially when it's from a non-playable character alright
[344:36.59]the same moves that I do fucking parried again it's a fucking what the fuck I'm doing that I'm I'm getting up there and I'm gonna do the same thing to this goddamn asshole I'm gonna parry you now you're getting parried now it's your turn
[345:04.62]Where are my souls?
[345:06.18]Okay, right.
[345:16.93]You're just getting outplayed.
[345:18.01]Yeah, I feel like this is what happens when I play online.
[345:21.76]If I ever go invade anybody, I just get embarrassed.
[345:25.74]I would much rather be the purple guy.
[345:28.54]During an invasion that just kind of runs around and just like swings and stuff and hurts somebody once and then just runs off a cliff.
[345:35.15]That's the kind of support and evader I am.
[345:45.64]Purple guy from Dark Souls.
[345:51.62]You know, you can be a purple phantom.
[345:56.70]Alright.
[345:57.42]Dick.
[345:57.92]Let's go.
[346:05.64]Look at how predictable your swings are too.
[346:07.18]Let's see how good you handle this shit.
[346:13.17]Mr. Predictable.
[346:32.08]Oh look, it's Mr. Predictable.
[346:33.64]There you are.
[346:34.62]I can do the same move.
[346:47.67]This guy, just don't swing your weapon at him.
[346:53.16]Just don't swing at him, because he's going to parry every single R1.
[346:55.90]Oh, that hurts.
[347:00.78]Big time.
[347:03.98]I can't.
[347:04.28]Okay, so just do not R1.
[347:05.76]Ever.
[347:09.28]I was expecting that if I knocked him down, when he got up, he wasn't going to immediately just parry.
[347:14.20]Usually you have like a few seconds to swing.
[347:19.11]Just lead him into the ball.
[347:20.37]No, I want to beat him one-on-one because I want to embarrass him on stream.
[347:25.01]I want this guy to lose and then go look at the chat.
[347:30.53]What are they saying about me?
[347:31.45]Open Jerma 995.
[347:34.14]Everyone's like OMEGALUL, OMEGALUL.
[347:35.64]You shit on him, OMEGALUL.
[347:37.18]Wow, like OMEGALUL.
[347:38.93]Like, you know, that kind of stuff.
[347:40.77]Like, wow, you lost a Jerma.
[347:42.17]Holy shit.
[347:42.73]Like, you should fucking delete your fucking save file.
[347:45.68]Let's go.
[348:08.78]You can't parry though, stop trying!
[348:30.62]That was definitely a good time to do that.
[348:32.98]You're not losing to NPC.
[348:38.89]Quiet.
[348:39.17]Holy shit, that probably was an instant kill.
[348:46.43]Don't do it!
[348:47.35]Don't do it!
[349:13.11]These guys are gonna get crushed by a fucking bowling ball in five minutes.
[350:12.80]That's it.
[350:44.43]What the fuck?!
[350:45.39]No!
[350:45.89]What?!
[350:46.73]What are you talking about?!
[350:48.07]You don't have the mana to do that move?! !
[351:24.44]I kind of want that move, though.
[351:25.48]It's actually really good.
[351:26.56]Maybe he probably drops it.
[351:27.36]Alright, new strategy.
[351:34.07]It's called stand in a... I got it.
[351:35.27]I know what I'm doing.
[351:36.07]I'm going to stand in a safe place and just, like, fucking dodge around.
[351:39.99]And, again, he's going to get hit by the bowling ball, like, three times.
[351:43.31]I'm just going to block.
[351:49.50]Thankfully, my souls are right here.
[352:02.72]What was wrong with that?
[352:05.68]Like, I'm so tilted that that didn't parry.
[352:08.01]What happened?
[352:08.37]What was wrong with that?
[352:09.87]I don't understand.
[352:10.43]That was, like, almost perfect.
[352:20.55]He's damning now.
[352:22.18]Okay.
[352:42.02]Crush him!
[353:09.47]They just taunted me!
[353:34.54]Intelligence scaling, what?
[353:40.15]I don't get it.
[353:40.45]What does it mean?
[353:41.05]Is it like a magic shield?
[353:41.81]Okay.
[354:09.96]Oh, he lost to Jerma.
[354:15.01]Is he in chat right now?
[354:19.01]Dude, like... Fuck you, dude.
[354:26.41]I like playing against people and shit, but taunting in the middle of a match?
[354:30.04]You're fucking shitty.
[354:33.54]I don't think I need to tell you that.
[354:40.98]Box magic?
[354:41.57]That seems like it's going to be pretty useful.
[354:42.85]Alright, wait.
[354:46.17]Is this a shortcut?
[354:50.31]Yes, that was an NPC.
[354:51.71]Yes, it was an NPC.
[354:53.32]That's not a real person.
[355:01.56]Is this a shortcut to something?
[355:03.25]Where am I?
[355:11.71]I'm scared to open this door.
[355:12.79]I'm kind of afraid to open this.
[355:23.33]Let me try the other way first.
[355:34.94]Yeah, that feels like a boss door.
[355:36.50]A big one.
[355:37.10]So, I'm not going there yet.
[355:39.91]There's another way to go this way.
[355:41.13]I still have enough... I still have plenty of health.
[355:44.15]I'm not scared.
[355:51.28]Well, I... I got a lot of runes, too.
[355:57.86]I'll be able to level up one more time.
[355:59.24]Probably putting it into... Endurance.
[356:02.71]Endurance.
[356:05.92]Maybe?
[356:08.14]Or vitality again?
[356:10.14]I need to get vitality to at least 20.
[356:12.90]There's also the portal, yeah.
[356:14.46]Well, if I get a new bonfire, then yeah, obviously.
[356:18.59]I don't want to get teleported across the whole game.
[356:20.55]Well, I guess it's not that far.
[356:29.88]Oh, okay.
[356:30.22]Okay.
[356:33.58]Uh, no, get me out of here, because this is... I know where this is.
[356:40.01]Wait, I've been here before, right?
[356:43.55]Have I been here before?
[356:44.79]Yes, I have.
[356:45.41]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[356:49.11]Well, that's a skip to get back there quickly.
[356:50.96]Alright, I'm glad I got that.
[356:52.14]Cool, okay.
[357:00.50]I'm going to put it into vitality.
[357:03.12]Or get intelligence to 25.
[357:04.08]What do you think?
[357:10.16]25 intelligence.
[357:10.64]Let's do it.
[357:11.00]I'm going to mine for OLED.
[357:26.77]It's not enough.
[357:33.15]Pinball route actually might be better.
[357:34.62]Yeah, it actually might be.
[357:35.78]Because this seems very dangerous.
[357:37.84]I'll try it.
[357:43.52]Yeah, I'll get into 25.
[357:44.45]Oh my...
[358:00.63]I'm going to stop putting points into intelligence now.
[358:04.70]Now I'm going to focus on vigor, mind, and maybe a little bit of endurance.
[358:10.44]That's where it goes there.
[358:11.62]Okay.
[358:16.49]Let's try this skip and see what it looks like.
[358:19.39]I could do the portal.
[358:21.81]Let me just see what's in that room so I can have the boss revealed maybe.
[358:32.67]Let's see how hard this is to do.
[358:33.83]Yeah, this kind of seems like a horrible way to go.
[358:40.84]I mean, I guess if you get through there, it's a little bit, maybe a tiny bit faster.
[358:47.36]Not really, though.
[358:48.22]Not really at all.
[358:48.84]You're going to deal with this bullshit right here.
[358:52.24]Hold on.
[358:56.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[358:58.73]Leave me alone for a second.
[359:00.99]I can jump to that.
[359:10.15]Interesting.
[359:11.71]Huh?
[359:14.97]Uh...
[359:38.02]Confused what's that brings a bowling ball actually turns out to be faster potentially.
[359:43.06]What if I go up the ladder?
[359:44.72]Hey, say it's my it's my brother's birthday my cousin's birthday.
[359:56.30]You're his favorite say his name ball sack.
[359:58.36]Oh
[360:29.27]There's no backstab.
[360:33.17]I gotta get up there.
[360:54.90]Yeah, this is definitely the better way to go.
[360:56.70]It's just not really that dangerous.
[361:13.26]Onion head.
[361:13.70]I would call that a clam head.
[361:15.34]That's definitely a clam head.
[361:24.71]Alright, so you gotta hug the left side.
[361:31.66]Okay.
[361:34.10]Let's try that again.
[361:36.30]Only this time.
[361:38.22]Not mess it up.
[361:45.01]I think I'm gonna kill one of the sorcerers first.
[361:46.53]You know what I mean?
[361:48.97]Just like sneak up right here and just go as much as possible.
[361:55.24]That was unfair.
[362:24.01]Ooh, that's a new staff, but I don't know.
[362:43.64]Who's casting?
[362:48.46]Dude, that came out of his penis!
[362:49.97]What?! !
[362:57.66]Where did this person come from?
[363:00.70]Where did you come from?
[363:01.54]Did you climb up the ladder?
[363:09.96]Sanctuary stone.
[363:11.18]Alright, we got some stuff to look at.
[363:27.23]Glintstone Scarab.
[363:28.55]Is that a helmet?
[363:38.52]Blue-green scarab wound directly on the head.
[363:42.18]Slightly reduces the FP cost of sorcery but increases damage taken.
[363:47.27]Oh my god, are you gonna be like a bug head?
[363:59.19]This is weird.
[364:00.13]Okay, but damage taken, I don't know about that.
[364:02.81]I think I like the Burger King helmet better.
[364:07.41]This is just intelligence.
[364:09.45]Which helps my weapon too, not just my sorceries.
[364:11.77]I think it's better overall.
[364:16.85]Any secret rooms?
[364:17.45]I don't even know where the fuck that guy came from.
[364:33.05]I think that's it.
[364:38.69]Okay.
[364:43.51]Carrying Glintblade Staff, or Academy Staff.
[364:49.61]Staff of the Academy, embedded with a turquoise glintstone.
[364:52.79]Only a recognized sorcerer is permitted to wield this staff.
[365:03.34]What is damage?
[365:06.04]It's a little heavier.
[365:06.92]It has B scaling.
[365:12.58]But this is plus 1 and it's 131.
[365:14.42]This is 0 and it's 130.
[365:17.20]I don't know.
[365:21.86]Look at this one though.
[365:22.60]Boost Glintblade Sorcery?
[365:23.82]This doesn't do anything.
[365:26.85]Scaling is all that matters.
[365:28.71]How much does this boost sorcery though?
[365:31.85]That's a good question.
[365:37.72]Well, I'll have to do a little bit of testing on that.
[365:46.75]Oh, man.
[365:47.69]I can go down here.
[365:53.01]Golden rune?
[366:02.28]Okay.
[366:04.62]And there's the teleporter.
[366:05.74]Alright.
[366:06.08]I'm going in...
[366:21.41]The arena of the lakes.
[366:25.44]This just pointed me here.
[366:30.40]Um... Okay.
[366:36.29]Ooh, alright.
[366:37.03]Well, I got a new... This is cool.
[366:43.01]Rest here.
[366:43.45]This game is too big.
[366:46.54]I mean, this game is very large.
[366:48.70]It's very big.
[366:51.24]Alright, what is this?
[366:52.04]Church of Vows.
[366:52.78]What's this place?
[366:59.02]Is this an NPC?
[367:01.26]You're tarnished, aren't you?
[367:04.02]I welcome you to the Church of Vows.
[367:06.68]Is he Pope Turtle?
[367:07.83]I am Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.
[367:12.75]My apologies for the unseemly state of affairs.
[367:16.93]Do you know the origin of this place?
[367:20.33]How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?
[367:24.31]I have no idea.
[367:26.49]Well, that is a shame.
[367:29.32]But who can blame you?
[367:31.28]The shattering has caused us, all of us, to lose sight of something very dear.
[367:38.56]It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined by the matrimonial bond between red-haired Radakan and Rennala of the Full Moon.
[367:54.48]and so our church holds in view the monuments of both houses the Earth tree of the capital
[368:10.11]Really?
[368:10.31]Probably Faith.
[368:33.79]You got... Oh my goodness gracious.
[368:36.79]Oh my god.
[368:37.39]Oh my god.
[368:38.55]Oh my god.
[368:39.53]Oh my god.
[368:40.09]I have scrolls to give you.
[368:48.46]But wait.
[368:51.10]Did I... Magic Flint blade creates a sigil that forms a projectile.
[368:58.80]I already have that.
[369:01.71]Arian greatsword.
[369:02.71]Performs a sweeping slash using magical greatsword.
[369:05.01]That thing's good.
[369:05.89]10,000 souls.
[369:13.70]Give scroll.
[369:15.48]Academy scroll.
[369:16.82]Oh, what have we here?
[369:19.08]Very well.
[369:19.68]Let us both learn together.
[369:22.10]Heresy is not native to the world.
[369:25.50]It is but a contrivance.
[369:26.88]It would be awesome if this guy was a summoner.
[369:28.32]All things can be conjoined.
[369:35.46]Swift Glintstone?
[369:36.54]Swiftly fire is magic.
[369:38.78]Great Glintstone?
[369:39.68]Oh, we got red Glintstone!
[369:42.38]Jesus.
[369:45.82]Star shower?
[370:08.18]I just got chills.
[370:09.37]I'm fucking excited.
[370:10.19]Alright, hold on.
[370:13.93]Gold sewing needle?
[370:28.40]Golden tailoring tools.
[370:39.98]Alright.
[370:43.52]Anything else here that I can take?
[370:52.91]No.
[370:53.19]Alright, so I gotta remember where this guy is.
[370:55.17]So this over here... Yeah, the Church of Vows is where I gotta go.
[370:59.81]Because... Some of those are probably really powerful.
[371:07.24]is there something else let me ask about uh radigan you wish to know more of lord radigan lord radigan was a great champion possessed of flowing the wolf he came to these lands at the head of a great golden host when he met lady ranala in battle he soon repented his territorial aggressions there and became husband to the Carian queen
[371:34.19]However, when Godfrey, First Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between, Radigan left Rinala to return to the Erdtree capital.
[371:45.60]becoming Queen Marika's second husband and king consort, taking the title of second Elden Lord.
[371:54.71]The mystery endures to this day as to why Lord Radigan would cast Lady Renata.
[372:00.85]Are people turning into animals or something?
[372:02.67]Because that was a wolf person.
[372:04.42]This guy's a turtle.
[372:05.62]He was chosen for the seat of Elden Lord.
[372:11.88]You wish to know more of Lady Rinala.
[372:14.56]She is queen, head of the Carrion royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
[372:21.83]That's definitely the boss.
[372:22.45]The great and beautiful full moon witch.
[372:25.93]Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radigan left her.
[372:29.73]And then, when the Academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away from the Grand Library.
[372:37.70]Okay.
[372:39.14]Alright.
[372:40.40]I did buy this one.
[372:42.06]So let's go get it.
[372:43.54]Put it on the bar and let's test it.
[372:51.81]Altered garment?
[372:52.43]What did I just do?
[372:56.33]Oh, don't do that.
[373:09.69]I don't understand.
[373:10.79]What, it takes the cloak off?
[373:11.89]It's just taking off the cloak and reducing the defense.
[373:20.08]Why would you do that?
[373:24.83]It seems kind of like a bad idea.
[373:34.94]Alright, this is... I need 52 intelligence for this, and there's no way I'm going to be able to have that now.
[373:40.33]But, I can do great Glintstone Shard.
[373:42.61]Let's test it.
[373:50.79]Ooh.
[373:53.21]That is big.
[373:53.97]It's slow, but let's see how much damage does it do.
[374:01.74]It's short range.
[374:04.79]346 fucking damage.
[374:09.95]Okay.
[374:12.17]I'll keep it there for now.
[374:12.95]That's a lot of mana.
[374:13.51]So.
[374:30.50]I can also upgrade my weapon, I believe.
[374:32.52]So, here's what we're going to do.
[374:35.34]I'm just going to go kill some stuff.
[374:37.92]Actually, no, I don't.
[374:38.42]I don't have to.
[374:38.96]I have, uh, crushies.
[374:40.80]Crunchies, whatever.
[374:43.50]Then I'm going to go see if I can find... Whatever the boss... Whatever that is in there.
[374:46.28]I should be able to do this.
[375:03.39]I don't want to use that on my missiles.
[375:04.81]Okay, we got 1,200.
[375:06.69]Should do it.
[375:15.88]Really?
[375:16.52]I thought I got a five.
[375:17.74]Didn't... It's horseshit, isn't it?
[375:33.94]I didn't get- I thought I got one.
[375:39.31]Did you watch over Roderika?
[375:41.29]You need four and you have zero.
[375:43.99]That's what she wants.
[376:00.17]I refuse to believe it I don't doubt you but I know when something's too good to be true um I mean go talk to rodrigo okay who's rodrica I do have a talent for spirit I suppose I'll ask man
[376:34.82]No, it's not you.
[376:35.39]It's not you.
[376:37.97]Oh, wait.
[376:38.77]Roderick is over here.
[376:41.07]Is the guy going to talk to me yet?
[376:42.49]No.
[376:42.57]Wait, that's not... Who is it?
[376:45.47]That was her.
[376:46.35]You just had to wait.
[376:48.88]Oh.
[376:48.94]How come this person won't talk to me?
[377:08.75]I got some new items that I wasn't sure what the hell they were.
[377:11.19]This one here.
[377:14.20]I found materials for crafting.
[377:20.46]Stone key.
[377:21.14]I got all these cookbooks.
[377:31.41]This, yeah.
[377:31.79]You can do tailoring, sewing, needle.
[377:36.62]Grant's choice of affinity upgrade to weapon.
[377:43.70]When applying an affinity using physical and magic type Ashes of War, an additional affinity in Magic of Frost can be chosen.
[377:50.48]How do I do that?
[378:03.56]leave and come back and you can talk to her again.
[378:05.56]Okay, I'll just come back.
[378:09.72]Let's go to a random place.
[378:17.08]Adding the ash will prompt you.
[378:22.61]Okay, so now I can talk to her and she can upgrade stuff.
[378:33.14]Is she gone?
[378:33.62]Is she in the room with him?
[378:44.97]Where'd she go?
[378:46.07]Do you know where she is?
[378:52.63]Well, I took you for no matter.
[378:54.77]I had your arms.
[378:57.07]Where'd she go?
[378:57.57]Okay.
[378:57.79]Where is she?
[379:41.66]Huh?
[379:42.96]I mean, right next to him.
[379:47.20]It's just so unassuming.
[379:49.36]It's just so bl- I'm so blind to it.
[379:51.53]It's just un- I'm just like, oh, that has like a bunch of books.
[379:54.79]That was a- a- Clothes and books.
[379:57.43]That wasn't even a person.
[379:59.59]Good to see you again.
[380:00.59]I have you to thank, don't I?
[380:03.33]For persuading Master Hugh.
[380:05.43]I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning.
[380:10.43]I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish.
[380:13.61]Spirit tuning?
[380:14.45]If I might be able to help you all, I'd certainly like to try.
[380:18.45]And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted, well, I certainly must try.
[380:24.86]Roderika, the spirit tune apprentice.
[380:34.57]With the spirit tuning menu, you can spend runes in grave glove wards to strengthen the spirits you summon.
[380:40.03]What?
[380:53.06]Oh, man.
[380:54.76]Upgrade the boys?
[380:55.53]The boys suck.
[380:59.71]I should upgrade the knight.
[381:01.53]Get the boys to plus 10 or we riot.
[381:16.42]I don't know what I want to do yet.
[381:18.40]I don't know.
[381:18.80]I don't know what I want to do.
[381:21.73]I'll have to come back.
[381:22.35]I don't know yet.
[381:27.03]I have to make a decision on this.
[381:31.67]The boys are trash.
[381:34.37]Buff the boys.
[381:35.15]Pull the boys out of their misery.
[381:41.94]The boys upgraded the ghastly crew.
[381:53.02]Alright.
[381:55.00]We'll come back to that.
[381:56.91]We'll come back.
[381:57.33]I need to think about that for a minute because I'm either going to upgrade the boys to plus 10 or I'm going to have a super bro that's going to be able to come in and kill everybody in like two hits.
[382:08.29]Let's go ahead.
[382:12.57]I want to come back here.
[382:17.47]Where is it?
[382:20.21]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[382:21.47]Where is it?
[382:24.01]Not the church.
[382:24.83]Um, the school?
[382:26.61]Where's the... Classroom, right?
[382:33.09]Oh, where is it?
[382:37.25]Where is it?
[382:37.59]The debate parlor?
[382:42.47]Then you walk out?
[382:43.09]Yeah.
[382:50.70]Okay.
[382:52.59]I just want to go in and see what this boss is.
[382:54.52]I'm curious.
[382:56.50]We'll take another break.
[382:57.50]We'll take one more break.
[383:00.62]And then we will continue to play.
[383:05.35]And then conclude.
[383:06.27]We will conclude for today.
[383:09.65]I'm going to confirm right now that yes, I will be streaming tomorrow Elden Ring.
[383:28.43]But you'll die.
[383:33.73]I'm not gonna die.
[383:34.51]Alright, so then it was out here.
[383:44.12]And up.
[383:48.65]Whatever happened to El Bolo?
[383:51.99]Just killed him.
[384:00.53]Okay, here we go.
[384:04.25]Let's take a gander.
[384:11.32]Absolutely a boss room.
[384:14.04]No doubt in anybody's mind.
[384:45.21]What the fuck?
[384:51.47]Oh, it's the deacons.
[384:52.51]It's the new deacons.
[384:53.98]Okay, Deacons of the Deep.
[384:55.16]Let's go.
[384:59.82]Yeah, it's deacons.
[385:06.16]I'll soon birth thee anew, a-sweeting fresh and pure.
[385:14.68]Ah!
[385:50.34]You got fire coming out of your mouth.
[385:51.80]What is this horseshit?
[385:58.73]I got a feeling you gotta kill all of them and then the bubble will break.
[386:10.09]Boys!
[386:15.83]A chandelier dropped on him.
[386:22.43]A chandelier dropped on him.
[386:24.86]Fuck.
[386:27.66]God damn it.
[386:28.34]It's cracking.
[386:42.30]It's cracking.
[386:47.59]Somebody, okay, they pass it around, just like the deacons.
[386:49.68]This is actually deacons.
[386:53.44]I can't believe we fucking got crushed.
[386:55.90]I'm so sad that I didn't get that on camera, though.
[386:58.20]You know what I mean?
[386:58.96]Like, seriously.
[387:02.89]That would have been un-fucking-believable funny.
[387:09.43]Hey!
[387:10.37]What the fuck was that?
[387:26.20]Crack.
[387:31.04]Hi!
[387:36.17]Alright, now get out, get out, get out, get out.
[387:41.27]Now get out, now get out, now get out, now get out.
[387:44.17]Oh, this is so easy.
[387:45.93]Don't say that, you'll probably just lose.
[387:53.15]You got it over there.
[388:16.19]You just killed your own friend.
[388:43.67]You fucking loser!
[388:58.49]Panic!
[389:18.45]Here we go!
[389:21.83]Oh, that didn't do anything.
[389:23.65]What a waste.
[389:31.67]I forgot, she's a mage.
[389:39.44]Who has it?
[389:41.04]Oh no, that just reminded me of the boys.
[389:42.84]That just reminded me of the boys.
[390:11.72]Wow, wow!
[390:13.71]Where is the last one?
[390:14.45]Over there.
[390:23.07]This might be phase one.
[390:24.25]Because this is actually really not a big of a deal.
[390:26.33]Phase one?
[390:31.77]Or is that just the deacons?
[390:33.33]Yeah, of course it is.
[390:57.44]My beloved, have no fear.
[391:03.18]I will hold thee.
[391:05.53]Patience.
[391:07.87]Ye will be countless born.
[391:10.25]God damn it.
[391:10.89]Forever and ever.
[391:13.13]Well, it's not gonna be fun, is it?
[391:25.57]Of course.
[391:31.83]Let's go.
[391:32.99]That's gonna be such a pain in the ass.
[391:44.87]I have to do that bullshit, run around and smack people.
[391:47.64]Let's just be there for a strike.
[391:51.02]Witch?
[391:51.24]That means magic.
[391:52.06]That means panic dodging.
[391:54.76]...of the last queen of Caria... ...Rennala of the Full Moon... ...and the majesty of the night she conjureth.
[392:21.30]Holy shit, she's got a power beam.
[392:45.35]Oh, that's slow as shit!
[393:06.61]Bro, I- okay.
[393:12.67]She's a spammer, right?
[393:25.16]Use the magic shield?
[393:26.98]I wonder how much that eats damage, though.
[393:28.66]I was, I was, I don't know, I kind of wanted to see what you did.
[393:32.24]Well, that phase one is going to be such a pain in the ass to do over and over again.
[393:36.28]I'm going to summon the boys for that one.
[393:43.39]Okay, well, I can do that much quicker, though, because you don't have to kill them.
[393:47.71]You just have to walk around and break, walk around, break, break, break, break, break, break.
[394:05.84]I feel like once you get... Depending on how much that eats damage.
[394:10.54]Those slow ones might be able to eat them all.
[394:13.84]What about the break?
[394:14.56]Oh, shit.
[394:14.96]That's right.
[394:15.90]I'll do it after this.
[394:16.81]Hmm.
[394:37.77]Unless, okay, if she does not do anything more ridiculous than that, this might not be that big of a problem.
[394:50.05]Let's try this again.
[394:50.89]This time I know exactly what has to happen in the first phase.
[394:54.09]Just kind of run around.
[394:55.15]I really shouldn't need to get hit that much here.
[395:00.21]Let's find out.
[396:33.16]Where are you?
[396:34.10]Where are you?
[396:36.34]Where is it?
[396:37.87]Oh my god, where are you?
[396:39.47]You piece of crap.
[396:51.21]You idiot.
[396:51.81]I have to do a full cycle after this bullshit, aren't I?
[397:01.72]I'm so pissed.
[397:04.74]I can't lock onto her.
[397:08.34]You can't lock onto her when she's down there.
[397:11.56]Dumb.
[397:12.58]Dumb.
[397:15.90]Like I'm thinking R1.
[397:17.79]Right stick, R1.
[397:18.41]It won't work.
[397:24.00]It's so annoying.
[397:24.90]Dude, I'm in death.
[397:37.53]Can't lock on to the lady in the bubble.
[397:43.81]Oh my god.
[397:45.39]Stupid goddamn Deacon bullshit.
[397:47.81]Where is the- Oh yeah, I'm hiding behind him.
[397:49.99]Oh, he can't see me.
[398:02.25]Get down here.
[398:02.81]Yeah, you can't lock on to her.
[398:07.33]Well, you can, but sorry.
[398:08.21]There's like 30 people in the room.
[398:12.05]Do you want to lock on to one of the other 40 people?
[398:14.79]Alright, let's go.
[398:25.06]Okay, running is good for that.
[398:31.34]does this do what does this do what does that do why is there like a moon here now how much does it defend it's not that great I don't know I'm not I'm not a fan I'm not a fan
[399:07.06]Oh my god, you're so fucking annoying.
[399:08.94]Should I attack that?
[399:15.25]I don't, I have no idea.
[399:19.63]It's running left, the strategy.
[399:23.77]Kind of?
[399:24.19]Piece of shit.
[399:42.97]I gotta get in close.
[399:47.61]And when I get in close, she goes... Oh, flasks.
[400:05.26]Yeah, that's a good call.
[400:07.40]Blast and P. Yeah.
[400:08.84]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[400:15.93]Absolutely.
[400:16.53]Okay.
[400:20.61]I'll be right back.
[400:21.43]I'm gonna be really quick.
[400:22.37]I'm not gonna be long.
[400:22.93]I'll be right back.
[402:32.25]I didn't put any music on.
[402:33.45]Oops!
[402:35.57]Alright, let's do it.
[402:36.10]I told you that was going to be quick.
[402:40.20]I got a refill of water.
[402:50.26]Alright.
[402:52.28]Can somebody tell me how many runes this is?
[403:02.47]How many do I get?
[403:02.97]I don't know.
[403:07.77]This is golden rune 7.
[403:12.23]Is it 10k?
[403:17.01]2200?
[403:17.03]Maybe 2500?
[403:17.35]Alright, let's do it.
[403:25.60]Oh, it tells you if you sell it to merchant.
[403:31.38]Okay.
[403:33.86]So, the next strategy that I'm going to try is I'm going to stay just as close as possible.
[403:39.08]I'm just going to go... I'm just going to run, sprint directly, like, right into her stomach.
[403:45.15]Stay there.
[403:46.27]I ain't going anywhere.
[403:46.97]I'm going to try to just keep the gap closed.
[403:50.03]Just kind of just pivot around her.
[403:51.77]Dodge around her.
[403:54.00]How much longer are you going to be streaming after the last break?
[403:56.18]Probably an hour or two.
[404:02.73]Maybe somewhere on, like, the eight-hour mark.
[404:06.53]Maybe... It depends on how long this takes.
[404:08.85]It depends on if I can beat this tonight.
[404:11.85]If I beat this... This will probably be the last thing I do if I win.
[404:20.82]So, if... Whenever this happens... That's probably going to be the end of the stream.
[404:26.80]But... I mean, I spent, like, an hour and 20 minutes on the first boss of the game, so...
[404:32.51]We'll see how long that takes.
[404:33.35]Stream tomorrow or rest day?
[404:35.95]I'll be live tomorrow.
[404:41.86]Okay, no dumb mistakes.
[404:43.22]Let's go.
[405:57.76]Ahhhh!
[406:55.05]Close the gap.
[407:01.36]I wish it didn't take so long to load.
[407:02.80]You're getting me out of my rhythm.
[407:31.37]Where the fuck is your hitbox?
[407:33.27]Are you serious?
[407:36.83]You're like all clothing.
[407:55.17]This, I don't know what this is.
[407:57.45]I wonder if I should hit it.
[408:02.41]Okay, alright, so now I know what that fucking thing is.
[408:04.65]It's a big bomb if you touch it, it explodes.
[408:11.08]Alright, she doesn't, she, okay.
[408:19.49]She spins, she'll throw it out.
[408:30.82]Alright, watch out for this goddamn thing.
[408:53.71]Come on, boys!
[409:15.29]What the fuck are you talking about?
[409:23.74]Oh, fuck you.
[409:24.42]I'm not dealing with this bullshit.
[409:35.04]What the fuck?
[409:40.82]Come here.
[409:41.24]You're the one doing the incantation.
[409:42.68]Come, young giant.
[409:52.84]What the fuck is happening?
[409:54.79]I don't know if I would qualify in this fair fight.
[410:12.86]Get her!
[410:15.66]Okay, that... That was fucking horseshit.
[410:24.57]Hit them once, they'll go down in one hit.
[410:27.23]If I hit her, do they disappear?
[410:29.75]I feel like that might be a better idea.
[410:37.41]No, okay.
[410:42.55]They're all one-hit kills, and you have to dodge all of her other bullshit that she does, because she still casts spells.
[410:50.72]Okay, well, now I understand what's going on here.
[410:58.17]You had the boys.
[411:00.69]You're summoning giants.
[411:03.03]I have, I got, I have, okay.
[411:05.29]Three guys with torches and two guys with rusty shovels.
[411:09.30]I don't think is the equivalent of a gigantic 55 foot tall monster with a club.
[411:28.72]So that first phase, though, that was absolutely the play.
[411:33.36]All that projectile spam, as long as you just close the gap and you get right up, kind of right inner, none of it will hit you.
[411:42.67]The second phase, though, that's a different story because you have to dodge all the other bullshit from the people she summons.
[412:14.79]Dude, the lock-on is going to make me shit my pants.
[412:18.48]I can't tell what's better, R2 or just R1 spam.
[412:28.47]It's hard to tell.
[412:43.82]Oh my god, this is so fucking annoying, why?!
[412:46.26]Does that go through walls, the thing that she does?
[413:04.63]Watch out!
[413:09.37]So FromSoftware loves these, like, wicked annoying fights in the game.
[413:14.18]I have an idea.
[413:15.86]What's that first phase be?
[413:19.06]Just run around in circles while shit spams at you and you break the bubble and the lady comes out and then you fight the real boss.
[413:25.56]Then you fight the real fucking boss.
[413:27.42]I'm tilted.
[413:33.06]I'm tilted right now.
[413:53.61]I used two flasks already.
[413:55.15]This is a disaster.
[413:56.09]Let's go.
[414:26.27]Alright, you can't hit her more than once.
[414:38.15]Alright, worth trying.
[414:45.56]Oh my god, I hit you twice, you fucker.
[414:53.08]Hey, I'm running fucking through you!
[415:27.87]And she turns?
[415:28.69]I thought she stays in the same squad.
[415:43.92]I thought it was one hit!
[415:50.54]I thought it was one hit!
[415:59.40]I don't think that's accurate.
[416:17.17]Inaccurate.
[416:18.23]Inaccurate testing.
[416:20.11]Inaccurate testing.
[416:21.01]You just have to avoid it.
[416:39.23]God damn it!
[416:45.14]You can't even go near this motherfucker!
[416:49.96]This is such a random dog shit!
[417:04.38]Where does it-
[417:14.98]There's no scenery on this second stage, why are you losing?
[417:43.29]God damn it, if you... How dare you.
[417:50.28]That's exactly what you wanted.
[417:53.22]Oh, I'm sorry, but, um... She spawns... She spawns random ghouls and ghosts that... Will just attack you, and you just have to avoid them and attack her?
[418:08.25]She spawned that guy.
[418:09.73]That huge guy came and clubbed me in the back of the skull.
[418:13.11]From behind me.
[418:14.30]I didn't even know where he was.
[418:15.32]I gotta keep- I gotta send this back down.
[418:30.10]Hitting them once is true.
[418:31.10]I hit that dragon like four times and he was still there.
[418:36.83]Should we go casting versus casting?
[418:41.77]It's worth a shot.
[418:45.79]It's probably worth a shot.
[418:48.62]See what happens.
[418:49.88]Although I gotta stand still for a lot of that, which is probably not gonna happen.
[418:55.25]They disappear after a moment.
[418:56.49]Yeah, but they still exist, which is like... Oh my god, I can't hear anything.
[419:09.70]Sleep title, lullabies are scary.
[419:14.73]Sleepy, dee, dee, dee, dee, lullabies are spooky.
[419:47.48]Probably hiding behind a goddamn bench somewhere over here.
[419:54.67]Where?
[420:02.49]Something in my nose and I'm gonna pick it out in a second.
[420:05.57]Where is this person?
[420:08.65]God, that throw dice in the fucking air.
[420:10.46]Where is this person?
[420:15.37]Where the fuck is this person?
[420:17.14]Oh my god.
[420:18.20]Kill me.
[420:26.21]Kill me.
[420:26.57]Kill me.
[420:26.91]I can't use a flask here.
[420:28.17]Kill me.
[420:37.25]I really, okay, I really wish I could just beat this part like 30 times and then it was just like, okay, you've done it.
[420:43.14]Sir, you can just go to, you can just do the actual fight now.
[420:47.67]We just go right to the fight.
[421:07.03]Do you have a crossbow or something?
[421:08.69]I mean, it's just RNG, right?
[421:11.77]It's like, okay, you're going to get a good roll here.
[421:16.17]Is one of them going to be behind a bookshelf with it?
[421:19.29]Or is it going to be one of the thousand and a half people that are in the middle?
[421:31.30]Use the big wide range spell.
[421:32.76]I'm curious if the big one will hurt a lot.
[421:36.58]Because there are moments where I get like a second to cast it.
[421:41.92]I'm curious if it does a lot.
[421:56.66]I would not last one fight in this game without crying.
[422:02.32]Magic doesn't... I would imagine magic probably is not that great.
[422:06.97]Considering her repertoire of abilities.
[422:13.58]I got what I need.
[422:15.40]Could I probably get this to plus five?
[422:18.30]Weapon, maybe?
[422:21.51]I'm not giving up yet.
[422:44.32]Oh, it's about time.
[423:33.68]I think R1's better.
[423:36.19]I think R1's better.
[423:37.17]I really do.
[424:01.93]Hooray before she does the move!
[424:21.08]Sleep tight you fucking wanker!
[424:58.81]I tried to dodge, but he squinted instead.
[425:29.05]Boys!
[425:30.61]I'm like Ludwig.
[425:32.15]I'm like Ludwig.
[425:35.07]No!
[425:42.98]I don't have to do it.
[425:46.76]I don't have to call them in real life.
[425:49.55]I don't have to go like this.
[425:52.33]Stop fucking putting my hands up.
[425:55.38]I can't stop though.
[425:56.62]I don't know why.
[425:57.48]Here's the thing.
[425:58.06]Listen.
[426:05.96]It takes, like, one, two, three anyways.
[426:11.14]So that's, like, me going like, let's go, boys!
[426:15.15]Is the same, it doesn't, it's not like I'm actively not playing.
[426:18.19]It has to cast.
[426:21.33]So it's not like it's a problem.
[426:23.25]It's just like, I don't know.
[426:24.41]I just have to do it every time.
[426:26.13]You're a clown at heart.
[426:29.00]I was doing pretty good that time, though.
[426:30.40]But that's the problem.
[426:32.58]Calling out...
[426:34.11]The summons, it takes so long that you're just in a bad position pretty much no matter what.
[426:47.86]I keep calling out boys like Ludwig, I swear to God.
[426:54.28]I didn't even realize that's what's been happening this whole time.
[427:07.14]Okay.
[427:07.92]Come on, man.
[427:08.70]That was a pretty good run.
[427:09.92]That was not a bad one.
[427:12.69]Summon them right before the phase change.
[427:14.05]They'll come.
[427:14.57]Really?
[427:14.85]Alright, that's good to know.
[427:44.04]Yeah, our one's way better.
[427:44.96]Watch out for the people that put the fire on the ground.
[427:59.07]Carried behind a fucking wall somewhere.
[428:09.36]Where are you, you piece of shit?
[428:14.89]Does this block it?
[428:15.81]Does this block it?
[428:16.37]Will it actually block?
[428:17.83]Does this block?
[428:19.19]Does this block?
[428:21.01]Does this block?
[428:24.72]Will line of sight block?
[428:27.96]The stupid holy fire thing that she's about to do?
[428:31.72]Why did I just get Steam notifications?
[428:59.14]You can't get it in two.
[429:02.02]You can't get it in two.
[429:06.53]I just tried to get it in two.
[429:07.83]Nope.
[429:17.89]Get out of the way before she kills me with that stupid move.
[429:29.62]Sleep time.
[429:31.44]Sleep time.
[429:42.91]Reset.
[429:43.17]Motherfucker!
[429:47.54]Motherfucker!
[429:51.98]Hold on.
[429:52.58]Why am I in Steam?
[429:54.84]Why am I logged into fucking Steam?
[429:57.20]I'm not!
[429:57.63]I'm not even logged into Steam!
[430:09.19]That was a throw?
[430:09.81]I had to!
[430:15.38]Why stop?
[430:15.92]Because I got... I can't lose a health flask.
[430:25.24]You had seven heals?
[430:26.12]Yeah, but I had a full health bar gone.
[430:28.19]It was going to take one and a half to get rid of it.
[430:30.67]No, I cannot use a flask on that phase.
[430:32.93]I can't.
[430:35.31]I can't use a flask.
[430:42.53]You're getting bodied by the easiest main boss.
[430:49.96]I'll time that person off for 10 minutes because they haven't seen phase 2.
[430:56.11]How dare you come in here and say that without seeing phase 2.
[431:00.47]Phase 2 is stupid.
[431:12.18]Phase 2... No, I know.
[431:13.56]Phase 2 is doable.
[431:14.70]It's annoying, but it's doable.
[431:15.74]I just hate... It doesn't matter how much I go on.
[431:19.86]I go on the fucking FromSoftware forums, and I say, hey, look, I'm just a gamer, and I'm a big fan.
[431:25.21]What I would really like to see is no more of these free boss fight boss fights where just random shit happens, and then you fight the boss.
[431:33.57]I would appreciate if that would never show up in one of these FromSoftware games again.
[431:36.70]Otherwise, I will withhold my money.
[431:46.66]You just got downvoted.
[431:47.72]You have negative... They had negative, like, 400 upvotes.
[432:06.83]I am telling you right now, I don't know why it has to be the same color.
[432:13.91]I thought that was a person and I turned over here immediately and what ended up happening is I got hit by the chandelier because I walked initially this way because it's a yellow fucking thing on my screen.
[432:27.20]Just reset, reset, reset, reset.
[432:28.94]I'm not wasting two fucking potions.
[432:30.70]See what I mean?
[432:36.04]I'm not gonna say I'm a big fan of like when like you just throw random shit on every fucking inch of the screen and You know be careful though.
[432:43.01]Yeah, you know you can't memorize it cuz it just goes everywhere and then by the way I would love a boss that summons other bosses and other enemies at the same time that you're fighting Which can she can do in less than a tenth of a second, but you take for you to summon the boys It's really annoying.
[432:57.63]It takes me four seconds to do that when it should be pretty much instant
[433:19.86]You said you wanted the other story bosses to be different.
[433:22.70]No, I know.
[433:23.08]I think it's not a bad encounter.
[433:29.40]No, I think this is actually one of the... I love RNG, throw dice in the air, bullshit.
[433:34.46]I think this is probably my favorite encounter of the game so far.
[433:38.11]I think this is my favorite encounter so far.
[433:39.73]I'm pretty sure.
[433:54.74]He hates every main story boss.
[433:58.40]No, I don't.
[433:58.98]I'm just kidding.
[434:22.05]Just a reminder, you said you're going to love this area.
[434:23.93]I do love this area.
[434:26.43]I don't hate this boss.
[434:28.17]I just hate everything they stand for.
[434:46.05]God.
[434:47.59]You really have to...
[434:56.08]Motherfucker, where are you?
[434:59.13]Where are you?
[435:01.57]Where are you?
[435:07.21]Where?
[435:07.49]If that killed me, I would've screamed.
[435:49.57]Two potions down and this stupid shit.
[436:30.44]Fucking god, I hate this place.
[436:33.02]This is just stupid.
[436:35.40]This is just fucking dumb.
[436:37.56]This is just dumb.
[436:39.18]What the fuck, dude?
[436:41.74]Where the fuck are you?
[436:49.36]I'm just killing you because I wanna.
[436:57.83]Oh, no, I'm dead.
[436:58.84]I'm dead.
[436:59.20]I'm actually dead.
[437:00.10]I gotta start over.
[437:00.94]Like, I can't do this.
[437:04.82]Where even is this person?
[437:08.08]Where the fuck is this person?
[437:10.30]And by the way, um, what's going on with your house?
[437:13.97]Why is your house just collapsing?
[437:15.39]What are you doing?
[437:19.29]Why are chandeliers just falling from the ceiling?
[437:22.29]Huh?
[437:24.21]Maybe screw them in a little tighter.
[437:39.83]Wait, listen for the lullaby.
[437:41.73]It comes from directional audio.
[437:44.43]I feel like that person is just trying to get me to die by the end of the chandelier.
[437:57.70]It's real.
[438:00.25]Yeah, but they're all clumped up in the same zone anyways.
[438:12.59]all the way the books are coming from mono audio Andy it's the one that fires the books it's not are you sure it's not coming from random RNG random directions make it look good in front of 10,000 people
[438:44.96]books it's the buckers with the books and I'm my brain is putting what the fuck happened there
[440:31.13]I don't hear anything.
[440:31.83]I don't hear any singing.
[440:32.53]I don't hear any... I don't hear any singing.
[440:49.08]corner down here oh my god you had to be in the stupidest fucking possible stupid stupid alright
[441:35.11]The boys just kind of fucked that up.
[441:36.85]And now they're all dead.
[441:39.99]Bye, guys.
[441:47.92]The boys are actually fucking this up.
[441:49.78]The patterns are weird.
[442:15.12]goes around her left side.
[442:16.36]Get it, Ryder!
[442:16.74]Come over here, giant.
[442:46.53]What is it?
[443:23.67]Yay!
[443:53.54]I dodged it!
[443:55.54]You fool!
[444:15.83]Giant?
[444:20.32]Giant?
[444:21.28]Giant?
[444:23.99]Get that balloon shit out of here.
[444:52.31]so so so
[445:19.09]God damn it, the fucking, it's so stressful with the fucking dogs behind me.
[445:24.58]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[445:29.00]It's just like trying to fucking find the right spot to be in when you're just, somebody's just running behind you.
[445:37.54]I want to fight the boss, not the dickheads that she summons to the party.
[445:42.81]Alright, alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[445:58.14]Use your spells, they'll do negative damage.
[446:11.53]So, okay.
[446:12.77]There's four things that she brings out.
[446:14.65]Unless there's something I haven't seen.
[446:15.71]There's... A giant which spawns right behind you and swings down... Two or three seconds after she spawns it.
[446:23.69]It's always behind you.
[446:24.75]You literally can't see it.
[446:25.53]Dogs...
[446:28.48]Are probably the worst one.
[446:30.08]Or the dragon.
[446:30.82]Because the dragon is just so huge.
[446:32.72]The dragon flies up in the air.
[446:33.98]Making it like a huge pain in the ass.
[446:35.06]You have to like just try to dodge that.
[446:36.49]I think the dogs and the dragon are the worst ones.
[446:38.61]I don't know if it's RNG or not.
[446:40.85]A little like slimy.
[446:42.51]Like squirrely guy.
[446:44.21]That is on the ground with the blades.
[446:46.29]You just have to run away.
[446:57.15]I could try a different summon, yeah.
[446:59.99]That one was close.
[447:31.70]How do you already have the bubble on you?
[447:38.77]Good RNG right there.
[448:15.59]Your stupid... your stupid fucking voice line is talking over the singing.
[448:19.57]Get behind something!
[448:46.78]What?
[448:52.67]New plan.
[448:54.05]The boys are gonna get summoned when she goes into the moon for the first time.
[449:05.96]When she goes into the moon, boom.
[449:09.73]I do say boom.
[449:10.65]What a dipshit.
[449:23.84]Thank you for watching.
[450:13.06]That homing missile!
[450:14.12]It just fucking homed the missile!
[450:15.30]Ouch!
[450:24.51]Get her!
[450:28.95]Get her!
[450:44.36]Oh no.
[450:56.16]Dragon, alright.
[451:04.39]Where is he?
[451:14.88]You gotta- come on, dude.
[451:16.26]Like, you can't even see where the fucking- where he goes.
[451:18.96]It's like, I have to- I have to look at him.
[451:24.42]I can't just guess.
[451:25.28]That was a good one, too.
[451:34.64]I can hear her casting, but, like, it's either she's gonna cast a spell and I have to dodge it, or I'm gonna dodge the spell, and this guy that just goes into the fucking skybox is gonna land on me and kill me.
[451:52.28]Can you use your horse?
[451:53.20]No.
[451:54.40]Unfortunately.
[451:55.22]I would love to get on the horse.
[451:59.44]I thought that was gonna be the one.
[452:01.02]I really did.
[452:10.07]Ignore the dragon when he goes up.
[452:11.27]But if I ignore the dragon when he goes up, he's gonna come down and land.
[452:15.33]And it's gonna... It does, like, I think 70 or 80% of your health bar.
[452:20.36]And then I'm, like, in a bad position and she might already have a spell out.
[452:29.38]Dragon won't land on her.
[452:31.63]I think it already has.
[452:32.65]The wolves are more aggressive.
[452:36.33]I'll try the wolves.
[452:39.68]That same exact strategy is going to apply though.
[452:46.90]She goes into the little thing.
[452:48.42]Wait till she goes in and then go for it.
[452:55.78]Just run when the dragon comes.
[452:56.88]Yeah, but the dragon, the dragon, the dragon's like as big as the whole screen.
[453:00.78]Like, it don't really matter where he lands.
[453:05.48]He's going to land.
[453:06.10]He's probably going to land on me.
[453:08.60]He can't see him.
[453:50.81]God, you bastard!
[453:54.49]Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!
[453:57.15]Don't... do it.
[454:00.29]Didn't want to use a heal, but I have to.
[454:43.95]oh my god
[455:29.67]Gretchen, get her!
[455:38.84]Get her!
[455:41.34]No moves.
[455:42.30]Don't let her do any moves.
[455:47.53]Call it out, what is it?
[455:51.35]Why can't I hit these fucking things?
[455:55.51]He just ate that whole thing.
[456:09.66]Get that fucking thing away from me!
[456:26.75]Okay... I need to be able to see BOTH of your asses!
[456:40.69]You don't get two, right?
[456:54.26]Oh, please, you can't even do that.
[457:00.90]Giant.
[457:23.79]Dude, just stop.
[457:24.95]Do fucking something else.
[457:35.70]Oh, God.
[457:36.42]I haven't been able to go even near her.
[458:02.35]God, you piece of shit!
[458:05.65]Like dude, like she kept spawning people one after the other after the other after the other after the other!
[458:12.59]It's like, how are you supposed to fight this just fucking random dice roll bullshit?
[458:32.68]You can interrupt the summons.
[458:35.35]She does it so fast that, like, there's a knockback on it.
[458:44.67]Okay, she spawned another thing when the dragon was just still there.
[458:49.27]I wonder if that's just a thing that she can just do.
[459:00.92]Maybe bleed weapons?
[459:01.84]I mean, it's too late for that.
[459:02.90]It really is.
[459:06.87]I've already spent all my stones upgrading this thing.
[459:08.88]I am... She's close.
[459:11.74]Okay, here's what's gonna have to happen.
[459:13.72]I have to get favorable RNG.
[459:17.06]No, like, dragon, then giant, then dragon, then dogs, then guy.
[459:21.53]Like, I need, like, at least two or three moves in between.
[459:26.63]She did that, like, stupid beam thing, and I couldn't get close to her.
[459:36.97]And you hop over the summoning circle.
[459:39.20]You probably can, but she still summons it.
[459:42.13]I wonder if there's a... Maybe there is a way to just stagger.
[459:43.85]Maybe try R2.
[459:46.32]I'll give it a try.
[460:24.65]I'm sorry.
[461:14.51]That's gonna explode!
[461:20.18]Oh, come the fuck on with your stupid phase one.
[461:24.44]Eat my ass!
[461:33.95]I want stamina.
[461:45.99]Yeah, rolling probably is worse than juking.
[461:47.85]I'll stop rolling.
[461:51.70]And this, I'm telling you right now, that shit takes you out.
[461:54.52]That takes too long.
[462:21.34]Fucking shit.
[463:03.11]Okay, you can't, but... What the fuck am I locking onto, dude?!
[463:25.81]Dogs are getting in the fucking way!
[463:26.89]Get out of the fucking way!
[463:56.73]The giant!
[464:09.18]Where is she?
[464:09.50]Oh my gosh, she's inside of the snow globe.
[464:30.14]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[464:36.72]I'm coming for you bitch.
[464:40.91]I was just killed
[465:13.23]I'm really glad for all this soundproofing.
[465:24.61]I'm screaming like, no, no, don't.
[465:28.17]I'm coming.
[465:28.99]I'm coming for you.
[465:30.53]This is bad.
[465:31.21]I can't scream it.
[465:33.61]Oh, that was horrible.
[465:34.63]That wasn't even that bad.
[465:37.22]It was.
[465:48.13]Okay.
[465:48.69]Alright.
[465:49.77]Alright.
[465:53.36]Okay.
[465:54.62]40,000 souls, by the way.
[466:04.14]You're a cheater.
[466:05.26]And I hate you.
[466:05.91]You're a dumb boss.
[466:07.11]And, yeah.
[466:08.19]Take that orange and fucking... You can throw that orange in the ocean.
[466:12.85]That, like... Whatever that is.
[466:14.25]That little, like, cutie orange.
[466:15.59]Like the clementines.
[466:16.69]You can fucking peel it...
[466:23.35]Okay.
[466:24.91]Let me make sure I don't die here.
[466:27.77]So what's the problem?
[466:28.39]What's going on now?
[466:29.49]Let me do this.
[466:47.22]Don't!
[466:47.52]Don't!
[466:47.80]Don't!
[466:48.10]Don't!
[466:48.40]Don't!
[466:53.78]I'M COMING FOR YOU, BITCH!
[466:58.22]Oh my god.
[467:00.17]If that killed me, can you fucking imagine if that killed me?
[467:03.25]Because it doesn't count.
[467:06.95]It doesn't count if you die during a boss fight.
[467:13.51]That would have been so awful.
[467:31.52]But look, this is what I'm talking about.
[467:32.88]Ready?
[467:33.20]Like, okay.
[467:34.10]So... Hold on, let me put it on the screen.
[467:38.80]So look.
[467:40.60]When... Check this shit out.
[467:46.84]I did a full heal right before this.
[467:49.44]Because I remember I rose right after the giant came out.
[467:55.81]And I said, like, oh shit, I better be at full health for this.
[468:00.32]I kill her.
[468:02.39]So I kill her, right?
[468:04.17]I have almost full health.
[468:05.95]I'm coming for you, bitch!
[468:08.79]Look at this move that's still there.
[468:09.79]Can you imagine if I did not have that face?
[468:30.98]That's fucking embarrassing.
[468:37.57]It was embarrassing.
[468:41.41]Okay, so there's a chest right here.
[468:43.05]Already sat at that, right?
[468:52.55]I'm right here.
[468:53.07]I'm opening up the treasure chest.
[468:55.87]It's locked.
[468:56.60]There are books and light aplenty.
[469:00.48]Dither not.
[469:02.40]Come out thou.
[469:06.49]Is it thy wish to be born anew?
[469:10.21]To become a sweeting.
[469:13.55]Reborn of my beloved egg.
[469:17.12]I just realized that her hat is like a snake or a bird or something that has eyes.
[469:22.74]Rebirth cosmetics?
[469:27.52]Okay, so I can redo this.
[469:30.86]Rebirth.
[469:31.90]Should I do that?
[469:35.64]I'm kind of afraid to do that.
[469:36.90]Because that's probably just part of the story, right?
[469:44.28]It's a re-spec?
[469:47.59]They added re-specs to... Really?
[469:51.01]No way!
[469:56.88]It's a stat refresh.
[470:04.98]Has there always been a respec?
[470:06.26]I don't remember.
[470:06.90]You lose 10%.
[470:07.46]Pick your great runes.
[470:12.04]Oh, right.
[470:13.18]I would imagine I probably got something from her.
[470:14.60]Take the power.
[470:20.24]Ooh, we gotta go.
[470:20.88]Okay, yeah, this is gonna be huge.
[470:24.66]Alright, well I don't want to do that.
[470:25.60]Let's level up.
[470:26.06]No, I'm not going to level up yet because I want to maybe get one of those spells.
[470:30.00]Okay, let's... I can teleport here whenever I want.
[470:33.96]This is the Grand Library.
[470:37.81]Let's go back here.
[470:42.77]Yeah, that's a lock chest.
[470:45.69]I want to see what this is.
[470:47.67]I'm going to go talk to the finger lady.
[470:51.27]In here.
[470:55.57]This is the creepiest thing in this whole game, by the way.
[470:57.35]It's just so weird.
[470:59.23]Have I?
[471:25.60]Seek the Erdtree and an audience with Queen Marika to become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order.
[471:36.28]I'm not done streaming yet because I want to... I think I want to go to that Castle Skip foggy door.
[471:44.47]Take this.
[471:46.25]A token of farewell.
[471:50.25]More talismans.
[471:51.01]Now become Elden Lord.
[471:59.40]Okay.
[472:02.87]What is that?
[472:03.69]60 intelligence.
[472:12.35]Full moon sorcery?
[472:13.87]70 intelligence.
[472:20.08]Guys, I don't think we're getting there.
[472:25.62]60.
[472:25.66]This is astrologer.
[472:27.54]Yeah.
[472:30.14]This is definitely for astrology.
[472:31.24]Because I don't think it's reliable that I'm going with this character, with this kind of battle mage.
[472:41.79]I don't think I get to 60 intelligence.
[472:46.20]I don't want to go full sorcery.
[472:47.70]It sucks with bosses.
[472:48.58]Full sorcery is really fun to try to cheese bosses and stuff, but for a first playthrough, it's hard.
[472:58.63]You have to kind of stand really still.
[473:00.83]I don't like sorcery for the first time.
[473:08.44]That's so goddamn cool looking though.
[473:12.06]Is it a sword?
[473:12.68]It's a staff, right?
[473:16.96]It's a scepter.
[473:26.16]I could just consume the soul, too.
[473:27.38]This is really awesome.
[473:30.54]But I think for the first playthrough, I kind of have to stick with what I'm doing here.
[473:34.75]And that's spells, light spellcasting, battle mage with the dex and scaling weapons.
[473:45.42]This looks insane, though.
[473:46.71]Doing, like, a full, complete, just, astrology.
[473:50.61]Or just dumping every single point you get into sorcery.
[473:53.69]Or intelligence.
[473:55.19]I think you can probably one-hit kill bosses with this.
[473:59.05]It looks like a sword, but it says stuff, yeah.
[474:08.20]I also want to look at this, too.
[474:13.80]Where is it?
[474:24.13]Okay, this is Godrick's Great Rune?
[474:27.29]Did I get a Great Rune?
[474:28.27]Okay, Great Rune of the Unborn.
[474:29.36]Use to perfect rebirth.
[474:32.70]Oh, so you use it.
[474:33.48]Okay, so this is the Great Rune.
[474:38.64]Oh, once I respec, this is gone.
[474:40.06]This is the Great Rune.
[474:41.04]Okay, cool.
[474:51.05]Go back to the turtle, yeah.
[474:53.11]I'm gonna break it.
[474:55.52]I know it's sad and those items look so cool, but it's just not gonna work with what I'm working with.
[475:01.08]So I'm gonna crush it.
[475:08.02]Unfortunate.
[475:12.03]But... If we're gonna be like at 35, 40 int... 30 dex...
[475:27.10]Yeah, 60 and 70 intelligence means I have to redo the whole character.
[475:31.42]Which, I mean, this thing is awesome.
[475:34.58]Don't forget.
[475:35.52]Don't forget what we have equipped right now.
[475:41.28]This thing is awesome.
[475:43.98]It scales off of int, dex, and strength.
[475:46.32]But we're doing pretty much int and dex.
[475:56.09]Bring some water.
[475:56.65]Got you covered right here.
[476:04.03]You should just do full sorcery.
[476:06.35]I would be pretty bad at full sorcery.
[476:09.17]Like I said, full sorcery requires you to essentially stand still.
[476:13.87]Which I don't like doing.
[476:15.49]I'm not confident enough to do it.
[476:17.13]Maybe like another two or three playthroughs and I'll do like, yeah, I'll do a full just caster caster.
[476:21.09]No melee weapon, no swinging at all.
[476:24.27]Alright, let me go to the turtle.
[476:34.64]And this will be it.
[476:36.60]Wait, I want to look at that.
[476:37.69]I'm going to go to the castle skip.
[476:41.03]Because I want to see what those keys do.
[476:43.95]The foggy door.
[476:45.37]Alright.
[476:55.51]Glintstone, Comet... This is in 36, which we'll get there.
[476:58.93]We'll definitely... Star Shower sounds cool.
[477:01.69]Our six shooting stars that pursue foes.
[477:04.07]So that's like the... And they... The thing the dog was doing to us.
[477:09.88]There's also this thing.
[477:13.24]I can afford them all, but I don't know if I really want to buy them all.
[477:18.74]This is probably the best one to get.
[477:21.24]Because this is melee.
[477:23.01]I believe this is melee.
[477:24.01]Okay.
[477:25.82]So I'm going to get it.
[477:27.62]This one is kind of cool too.
[477:28.88]I kind of want the comet though.
[477:49.55]Let me go check and see how this one looks.
[477:53.37]Because if this is the one that I think it is, I can incorporate this into a rotation.
[477:58.64]You know what I mean?
[477:59.06]I can like slash, slash with the magic weapon.
[478:02.32]Which is exactly the kind of character that I'm trying to make.
[478:06.52]You look like an SCP.
[478:09.14]Oh, I sound like one too.
[478:19.35]Is this what I think it is?
[478:28.77]Yeah, it is.
[478:29.35]So I could be like, wham.
[478:31.23]Wham.
[478:37.37]It's kind of, it's a good potential, I wonder if it, uh, if it staggers.
[478:42.13]It is really slow, but that is precisely, thank you for bringing that up.
[478:47.26]There's a really good point.
[478:48.85]That's why we're putting points into dexterity.
[478:51.67]So, I want dexterity up too, because if you don't know... Let's do an explanation.
[478:57.65]Dexterity reduces casting time of spells.
[479:02.77]So, eventually, this thing could actually be faster.
[479:05.13]Way faster than this.
[479:06.07]Let's see how much damage it does.
[479:10.26]How was the skill?
[479:14.78]I wonder, does it have a three swing or is it just two?
[479:20.68]It can just be chained.
[479:22.76]It's got a massive arc too.
[479:24.72]Look at that arc.
[479:27.08]That's pretty useful.
[479:29.20]Now we're going to do decks.
[479:30.04]We have to make sure we can get some decks.
[479:31.40]So I don't think I'm going to buy the other shit.
[479:35.82]I'm going to level up.
[479:43.43]25, 25, and then we'll do Endurance.
[479:46.45]Mind, maybe.
[479:56.86]Could get this over with.
[480:00.56]But that's, I'm just so, that's so many points to not put into something else.
[480:14.51]I want 25-25.
[480:15.25]I think it's actually really, really important.
[480:18.81]Let's see how fast this is now.
[480:29.35]That is way faster.
[480:33.77]That is at least 10-15% faster than it was before.
[480:46.06]No, it definitely is.
[480:49.52]What about Oleg?
[480:50.38]Well, now I can focus on Oleg.
[480:55.74]But I can't just let my damage fall off completely.
[480:57.54]I have to, like, be able to beat stuff in the game, too.
[481:01.88]There's no difference?
[481:02.66]Well, there has to be.
[481:05.26]I don't know if this is realistic.
[481:07.64]I think it's alright.
[481:11.68]Look, I have a respec if this doesn't work out.
[481:15.61]Greetings.
[481:16.63]Let me buy this other one too.
[481:18.09]This is like the little one.
[481:19.37]Swift.
[481:20.55]This actually could be useful too.
[481:24.96]Copium.
[481:35.72]This could be what it ends up being, right?
[481:37.88]Because I have the pole.
[481:47.99]Just a lot faster, so it could be like... Wham!
[481:53.61]Wham!
[481:54.19]Dodge!
[481:55.83]Wham!
[481:57.05]Lightning bolt!
[481:57.71]Lightning bolt!
[482:09.92]Yeah, I need mana flasks.
[482:14.50]Really cool though.
[482:15.52]Really cool.
[482:20.18]Let's see how much damage this stuff does.
[482:21.34]Because this little swift one, this could be a little... Just pick people off and, like, kind of poke at people.
[482:27.33]Let's check the one that I really care about.
[482:30.95]This one here.
[482:36.90]I mean, that's a lot.
[482:38.58]Considering my regular swing is...
[482:41.95]It's got huge range too.
[482:55.06]That one I don't really like so much, but I think this is a bad indicator because these guys are actually kind of hard.
[483:08.79]There's nothing in there.
[483:12.95]Alright, well, I just died.
[483:13.73]Alright, well, I'm just playing around with him.
[483:16.42]Um, I kind of want to kill that guy.
[483:17.58]He's... That doesn't seem like a regular enemy.
[483:29.68]It's kind of bad.
[483:30.34]I don't know.
[483:33.34]That's going to be amazing if there's more than one person.
[483:35.88]Can I hold the button down?
[483:36.54]Let's see.
[483:40.08]You cannot hold the button down.
[483:47.29]Oh, they're not here anymore.
[483:48.77]They come out at night.
[483:50.11]I get it.
[483:50.37]Alright, let's fight a group with it.
[484:02.67]Alright, it's showing its usefulness.
[484:10.85]Because that can really make or break anything.
[484:14.42]This one's not bad, but it's kind of... The other one hits a little harder.
[484:26.95]It's really good against groups.
[484:29.45]And some of the toughest shit in this game is when three or four people are all in front of you.
[484:40.71]I'll leave it on for now.
[484:47.44]So here's an interesting question.
[484:50.26]Does this scale... Do my sorcery moves scale with the staff?
[484:57.78]Or are they just based off of intelligence and that's it?
[485:00.40]I wonder.
[485:07.90]Both.
[485:09.96]So I really should be upgrading the staff too.
[485:16.97]If I can.
[485:21.29]This is good for stutter.
[485:23.03]I'll try it for now.
[485:24.74]Alright, we're not done.
[485:26.92]Almost done.
[485:28.90]I need to go back here.
[485:30.22]And I believe it's where... It's like right here somewhere, right?
[485:39.98]Here?
[485:42.12]I want to do that castle skip drop down.
[485:44.40]And then... There it is.
[485:48.58]The misty door for the keys.
[485:52.75]Is it this way?
[485:53.39]It's not this one.
[486:03.76]Bro, please, I'm begging you.
[486:04.78]Craft, man.
[486:08.66]Two main bosses down.
[486:09.48]I believe it's three main bosses down as of right this moment.
[486:13.03]Unless that wasn't a main boss.
[486:15.49]I think it was, though, because that was the academy lady.
[486:18.19]Okay.
[486:22.73]Bro, please.
[486:25.65]Oh, it's one of these, right?
[486:27.33]Main gate.
[486:28.83]Left side.
[486:29.29]I think it's main gate.
[486:40.98]I just don't remember.
[486:44.36]No, it's up there.
[486:45.38]I wrote...
[486:47.21]After Castle Skip, Foggy Door needs a key.
[486:51.37]But I should have told myself where the Castle Skip was.
[486:58.35]And I've played too many FromSoftware games.
[487:00.11]I think you have to travel from the bonfire.
[487:03.77]Rampart Tower?
[487:04.41]Does anybody remember?
[487:07.33]This is what I wrote down.
[487:22.33]Tower.
[487:28.66]This is it.
[487:29.10]Yep.
[487:29.38]Okay.
[487:30.46]So we go here.
[487:52.24]I think it's potentially a McDonald's night tonight.
[488:05.95]Time is it?
[488:06.49]Oh shit.
[488:19.25]It's late.
[488:19.85]My god, it's late.
[488:20.89]It's too late.
[488:22.73]Shit.
[488:30.59]It's late.
[488:44.62]Okay.
[488:46.12]I did it.
[488:49.01]Now it's down here, right?
[488:50.69]Right here.
[488:55.05]I don't... I wonder what's in here.
[488:57.02]Let's check it out.
[488:58.82]Here we go.
[489:19.13]Okay.
[489:30.84]What is this?
[489:33.28]Iron wet blade?
[489:37.08]And... Ockcrest wooden shield.
[489:45.96]Miserecord?
[489:49.88]Miserecord.
[489:54.12]What is that?
[490:01.66]Oh, it's a dagger.
[490:02.38]Hard and sharp, making critical hits especially potent.
[490:13.13]That's cool looking.
[490:22.49]That's cool.
[490:23.13]That's insane crit.
[490:25.03]Yeah, that's cool.
[490:33.31]I got one of those whetstone things too.
[490:36.29]Not entirely certain of what they are.
[490:37.79]Franch.
[490:47.54]Wish me a happy birthday.
[490:48.50]My mom forgot about it and I thought you could fill in for her.
[490:52.56]Happy birthday.
[490:53.12]That doesn't sound good.
[491:07.92]I remember looking in here from there.
[491:12.18]Okay.
[491:12.56]Well, cool.
[491:13.10]That's what that... Do I have any more keys?
[491:14.46]I think it's two to get in there.
[491:23.29]Yeah, that was one.
[491:23.97]Okay.
[491:28.30]Iron grants choice of affinity.
[491:29.70]Heavy, keen, or quality can be chosen.
[491:37.66]You can put this on a weapon, right?
[491:42.92]And it'll scale it for intelligence.
[491:46.53]Imagining, right?
[491:48.01]Or vice versa.
[491:48.59]You can change the scaling of the weapon.
[491:54.42]Okay.
[491:55.26]I think that's it.
[491:57.54]It's 1230.
[491:57.96]It's late.
[491:58.28]It's been about eight hours.
[491:59.92]I want to keep playing.
[492:05.27]Alright.
[492:05.73]I have a proposition for you.
[492:07.55]I have a proposition for everybody here.
[492:12.77]Here's my proposition.
[492:15.25]Two options.
[492:17.09]Option one is just keep going.
[492:19.79]I'm gonna eat.
[492:22.31]Like, I'll just go figure out what I'm gonna eat.
[492:26.91]No, this is a bad idea.
[492:28.03]Because then it'll get too late and I'll fuck up my whole sleep schedule.
[492:31.03]No, that's it.
[492:31.45]We're done.
[492:31.69]I wanna play.
[492:36.87]Okay.
[492:39.99]Uh, that's it.
[492:43.10]That was awesome.
[492:44.74]It was an intense session.
[492:49.14]We'll be live tomorrow.
[492:51.05]Tomorrow, starting at the same time, about 4 o'clock Pacific.
[492:57.21]I cannot guarantee we're going to do five days in a row, but, you know... I want to play Elden Ring.
[493:02.81]I just want to play it.
[493:05.82]So, if... I'm not going to... Here's the thing.
[493:08.44]I'm not going to play this game off-stream.
[493:10.12]Realistically.
[493:11.54]Realistically.
[493:13.98]Until I get to a point where I've seen a lot of the game already.
[493:17.36]So, I'm just playing it as I stream it.
[493:20.36]Which makes sense, right?
[493:25.16]So, I'll be left tomorrow.
[493:26.20]4 o'clock.
[493:29.17]Game rating update.
[493:30.01]It's still a 9.4.
[493:34.65]It has not changed.
[493:36.29]Although, it actually... It went down to like a 9.3.
[493:43.17]And then ticked back up to a 9.4.
[493:45.64]So it hasn't gone anywhere.
[493:52.66]Look at how much of this shit is... This is ridiculous.
[493:58.94]How long have I been playing this?
[494:01.26]Total hours.
[494:01.72]20?
[494:01.74]30? 25?
[494:13.48]It was like 10 hours the first day, 9 hours the second day.
[494:18.18]It's been like 27, 28.
[494:22.75]When I was... My first playthrough of Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, I don't think was more than 35 to 40.
[494:33.38]I beat Dark Souls 3 in like, what, 4 or 5 streams?
[494:38.34]5 streams maybe?
[494:38.86]4? 4?
[494:45.75]Like, five, yeah.
[494:48.77]I'm not even remotely close to even touching the surface of this game.
[494:53.99]It was eight streams plus the DLC.
[494:55.93]Okay.
[494:57.78]So, what, like five or six without it?
[495:02.16]I feel like after 30 hours in Dark Souls 3, you're getting close to, like, the last arc of the game.
[495:11.20]It's insane.
[495:13.85]Alright, this is, uh... Yeah.
[495:15.37]Yeah.
[495:18.04]I will catch you guys tomorrow at four.
[495:21.04]Get the credits.
[495:21.64]We'll just chill for a little bit.
[495:23.68]Thanks for watching as always.
[495:24.64]I know that I can be a little much sometimes.
[495:28.57]My rage.
[495:32.25]But no, I think the game is fantastic.
[495:34.01]It's just it's it's crazy.
[495:41.10]And I will see you later.
[495:47.44]I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do for food, though.
[495:49.26]Which, I'm not sure.
[495:50.14]Because it's very, very late.
[495:56.53]I'll figure something out.
[496:09.11]Uh, let's see.
[496:10.23]Let's see.
[496:29.72]I'm hungry.
[496:30.46]But what's even available, I wonder?
[496:33.28]Figure it out.
[496:41.09]We're going to raid BoxBox.
[496:44.59]I don't know where BoxBox is in the game.
[496:46.49]They're also playing Elden Ring.
[496:47.75]Let's see where he is.
[496:51.90]Do you guys do the same thing where you want to see where people are so you almost open one eye and you look down at the health bar and you kind of see what the area looks like and you click on it for two seconds and look away?
[497:05.19]I don't know where BoxBox is in the game.
[497:11.29]But it could be way further ahead than I am or it could be way before where I am right now.
[497:25.58]So, just be aware.
[497:26.62]There may be spoilers ahead.
[497:28.58]Be aware.
[497:34.12]Good night.
[497:34.92]Goodbye.
[497:35.54]Go say hi to BoxBox.
[497:41.75]See you soon.
[498:00.05]you
[498:34.91]you
[499:05.42]you
