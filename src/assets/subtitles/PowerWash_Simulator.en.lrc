[00:10.07]I am on time.
[00:11.89]I am on time.
[00:12.83]I'm here.
[00:13.09]I looked at the clock.
[00:17.35]About what time it was.
[00:18.15]It was ready to go.
[00:21.31]Then I freaked out, and I was like, I have to press the button right now.
[00:23.65]It landed on its side?
[00:27.44]What does that mean?
[00:29.74]Hello, though.
[00:34.20]How are you?
[00:36.00]Why do I feel like I'm so... I'm really tall right now.
[00:38.18]Let me do... There we go.
[00:40.12]My chair booster thing was up high.
[00:44.66]The air thing that makes you go higher or lower.
[00:49.09]Anyways.
[00:50.13]Hello?
[00:52.07]Today we're going to play PowerWash Simulator.
[00:55.69]The game that I've been talking about for a long time.
[00:58.49]And look it, we're finally going to do it!
[01:06.78]You're in a booster seat.
[01:07.74]It's confirmed funny.
[01:08.73]Alright, let me just tweet this out.
[01:09.59]I'll be right back.
[01:10.03]Give me a second.
[01:56.17]Alright, there we go.
[01:59.17]I might, you know what?
[01:59.89]I might have to take, I might... I'm gonna take a Tylenol.
[02:04.06]I woke up with a headache today.
[02:06.06]I need like a, like, ibuprofen or something.
[02:09.18]You know when you have that wicked bad headache brain?
[02:12.86]Anybody else get this?
[02:14.52]Or you'll be like, your head hurts.
[02:16.64]So therefore, like, words coming out comes out slower.
[02:21.11]Like, I'm talking right now, but it's going through like a headache filter.
[02:24.13]You know what I'm talking about?
[02:25.95]I hate that.
[02:30.17]Give me one more second.
[02:30.83]I'm going to take a towel.
[02:31.53]I'll be right back.
[03:49.29]Also, I feel like I'm way too close, yet way too far away from the screen at the same time.
[03:55.09]This is not right right here.
[03:56.05]Hold on.
[03:56.43]Now, I let Bugleberry borrow some of my audio equipment and some of my monitors.
[04:04.44]He didn't.
[04:04.74]He returned them wrong.
[04:06.12]Hold on.
[04:08.40]Move this back.
[04:10.95]That's better.
[04:14.15]Stalling.
[04:14.79]Stalling.
[04:17.57]Alright.
[04:18.13]Everything's too close to me.
[04:20.01]Get away from me.
[04:20.73]All my things are too close.
[04:22.13]I need to be sitting far away from my screen.
[04:27.61]You didn't change the category?
[04:29.31]What, I'm still in hot tubs?
[04:30.75]What?
[04:31.45]No, I'm not.
[04:34.97]I hope not.
[04:37.53]My go live notification is Bugleberry's Cauldron?
[04:42.03]No, no, no, no.
[04:42.87]Fix that.
[04:43.45]Change that.
[04:44.03]That's not what I want.
[04:53.16]Oh dear.
[04:53.78]Okay.
[04:55.82]Alright.
[04:56.06]We're good.
[04:56.40]We're good.
[04:56.70]We're good.
[04:56.96]We're good.
[04:57.26]We're good.
[04:57.60]We're good.
[04:58.24]We're good.
[05:00.75]Career ruining error.
[05:06.45]Oh God.
[05:06.91]Oh, hey, hey, Reagan.
[05:11.12]Thank you, Reagan, for the end community subs.
[05:13.60]Appreciate it.
[05:16.88]And Fars.
[05:17.70]Thank you, Fars.
[05:18.97]1-1-2-2-3.
[05:19.61]The community subs as well.
[05:24.11]There's no camera, right?
[05:25.51]No.
[05:27.06]Where's the... There it is.
[05:28.72]We're doing PowerWash Simulator.
[05:30.24]I can't wait.
[05:30.80]I'm really excited about this game.
[05:33.23]I thought this game was a joke.
[05:37.40]I willed this game into reality in my brain.
[05:40.51]Now I know that that seems incredibly egotistic, and an insane narcissistic thing to say, because this game's probably been in development for like a year or two.
[05:49.98]But if you remember six months ago, I was like, man, if there was only a game that you could just wash shit and clean stuff, and I could put my fingers on my head and I squeezed...
[06:02.55]In my brain, I willed this game into reality.
[06:06.37]It's not accurate.
[06:09.87]But here it is.
[06:14.31]Okay, yes.
[06:15.67]Do I even have audio?
[06:17.65]I do.
[06:20.45]Oh, there's a career... This is... I don't... I've never played.
[06:23.85]We're going to do career mode.
[06:26.17]We can't hear you yet.
[06:27.18]You can hear... I can see the indicator.
[06:31.77]uh clean the van is first one great news finally found a van for you at one of the auctions under your budget don't freak out when you see it looks like it's just been dredged from the bottom of a lake oh I can't wait but that's a good thing it meant no one else bid on it they missed out underneath that hideous layer of gunk is your perfect workhorse engine's a dream no rust there's even equipment in the back just needs a good hosing down and you're in business
[06:58.97]You'll certainly earn your pressure-washing stripes getting this thing clean.
[07:03.95]Oh, there's a five-star rating and you earn money?
[07:05.77]Okay, I'm gonna... Let's just be really, really clear.
[07:11.91]When did this game come out?
[07:13.31]This year?
[07:14.45]Was it 2020 or 2021?
[07:15.35]When did it actually... Well, is it out or is it in early access?
[07:23.14]I'm too quiet.
[07:23.90]Really?
[07:24.64]It shouldn't be.
[07:25.12]Hold on, let me see.
[07:32.75]Does the mic change?
[07:35.43]You know, you let Bugleberry borrow shit, and all of a sudden, look what happens.
[07:41.43]How about now?
[07:42.09]Is that better?
[07:42.45]Is that better?
[07:43.85]Are we good?
[07:46.54]I think this is where it was before.
[07:47.64]It got changed.
[07:48.46]I think we're good.
[07:52.10]This might be the best game of the year for me.
[07:55.90]We'll find out.
[07:56.32]You guys ready?
[07:57.38]Ready?
[08:02.01]That was very loud.
[08:02.97]I'm really glad you didn't have to hear it.
[08:05.31]Alright, select nozzle.
[08:08.05]Raise lower tablet.
[08:08.97]Is escape?
[08:09.59]Okay, selecting nozzle.
[08:11.13]Select extension.
[08:12.03]Select soap.
[08:12.73]There's different soap categories.
[08:15.14]Inventory.
[08:15.80]Rotate nozzle.
[08:16.98]Refill cleaning fluid.
[08:19.84]Show dirt.
[08:21.30]Walk, crouch, jump.
[08:24.10]Oh my god.
[08:24.86]There's way more going on in this game.
[08:27.38]Let me turn the volume down.
[08:28.22]It's probably really loud.
[08:29.16]Actually, not that bad.
[08:31.74]Show dirt.
[08:32.36]I am.
[08:33.94]Is it 90 FOV?
[08:35.10]Is it 90 FOV?
[08:37.42]No, here we go again.
[08:39.00]Is this 90 FOV?
[08:49.58]What do I do that?
[08:52.20]Control sensitivity.
[08:54.50]Controls audio.
[08:55.69]I think it is.
[08:56.23]Alright, let's do it.
[09:01.31]So, uh, this sensitivity is way too high.
[09:04.82]Fuck, Capcom.
[09:09.34]Way too high.
[09:14.20]Controller sensitivity.
[09:15.32]Oh, this is gonna be on console?
[09:16.30]Alright, that's fine.
[09:17.56]So, what did we do?
[09:18.00]Spray?
[09:20.16]Alright, I just, like, stripped the paint.
[09:21.92]That was way too much.
[09:24.18]Oh my god, that's loud.
[09:25.48]Hold on.
[09:27.75]If you did that to a car, you would rip the paint off.
[09:37.07]Alright, the ambience is fine.
[09:38.81]The power washer needs to come down.
[09:40.49]Water reverb.
[09:41.57]Turn the reverb down.
[09:42.41]Alright, there we go.
[09:45.62]That's fine.
[09:45.98]I think that should be good.
[09:47.62]That's better.
[09:50.52]Oh my god, I love it.
[09:51.58]How do I change nozzle?
[09:54.46]Oh, I only have the stubby gun.
[09:56.00]15 degree, 25 degree, 40 degree.
[10:03.88]Alright, this actually might be the best game ever.
[10:10.09]This is one I watch.
[10:11.23]I watch so many videos of people doing this shit, you have no idea.
[10:15.81]Guys, I will open up a power washing video, or like a wood cutting video, and just let shit autoplay.
[10:23.07]For hours.
[10:23.48]I actually have a quick story for you, talking about autoplaying, and maybe think about it.
[10:28.98]Um, so, like a week ago, I was watching TV, and we're gonna go into a story here.
[10:34.66]Okay.
[10:39.44]What's wrong with my voice?
[10:40.26]Hold on.
[10:41.40]We're gonna go into a story.
[10:44.20]So, I was auto-playing videos lying on the couch.
[10:48.71]And I don't turn auto-play off.
[10:51.09]I know I just turn it off, but I always forget to.
[10:53.39]And for some reason, I'm never logged into YouTube.
[10:55.93]I'm never logged into any service.
[10:59.13]So, even if I change it, I'm not gonna be logged in the next day, so it doesn't matter.
[11:05.66]So I'm on the couch lying down, I just had a big meal of fucking Burger King.
[11:09.82]Just kidding, it was McDonald's, I don't eat Burger King.
[11:16.56]And I fell asleep on the couch to auto-playing videos, and I believe it was cooking stuff.
[11:22.07]So, I woke up maybe 20 minutes later, and I was in that mode in my brain where I just, I could not move.
[11:31.77]You know, you just don't feel like it.
[11:33.79]Nothing will make you get up.
[11:35.23]Besides like a fire alarm, right?
[11:37.69]Just like, I don't care what's happening.
[11:38.93]I don't care what sounds are playing.
[11:40.12]I'm just gonna keep sleeping.
[11:44.00]Yeah.
[11:44.93]So, I heard counting.
[11:48.07]It was like, oh, like 2,448.
[11:51.65]2,500.
[11:51.67]Who the fuck is counting?
[11:56.31]And I just went back to bed.
[11:58.09]I was like, I don't care.
[11:58.83]I don't care to turn it off.
[11:59.53]I don't even know what it is.
[12:01.15]So, I got up with like a second or third time.
[12:03.49]And I looked up and I was like, why is Binging with Babish on the TV?
[12:09.86]And I hear 30,345.
[12:12.20]I thought I was binging with Babish doing like a counting video.
[12:15.08]So I was like, I don't care.
[12:17.12]And I went back to sleep.
[12:21.09]And then later on, like the next day, I was like, I'm curious, like what the fuck was that?
[12:26.15]And I watched on autoplay asleep the entire Vsauce Michael prime number video.
[12:34.04]It's like a four hour video.
[12:35.16]He says every single prime number up to like 40,000.
[12:40.01]woke me up like three times and each time I'm just like shut who's fucking counting stop counting please but I was too lazy to actually get up so I had I feel like that like gave me like a headache or something that may have changed me forever and I don't know why we do that shit why do we do that shit to ourselves and I did you hear Otto hold on let me get Otto Otto
[13:28.56]It has to be a scientific reason for it.
[13:31.65]But the act of waking up like 20% halfway, whatever it is.
[13:38.33]It's like your alarm on your phone when it goes off.
[13:42.69]It's like, oh yeah, I sleep through my alarms.
[13:45.95]You just don't care about anything but sleeping.
[13:50.05]Hearing four hours of prime numbers was not enough for me just to roll over and pick up the changer or the phone and turn off the TV.
[13:59.93]That was too much work.
[14:06.89]But I just suffered, and I say suffered wrong.
[14:10.91]But it was so bizarre, my brain was trying to piece it together.
[14:12.96]It was like, why is Babish doing this?
[14:15.72]Like, what is this?
[14:17.28]I thought I was dreaming.
[14:25.09]Oh, Otto?
[14:25.97]Uh, I can't.
[14:26.61]He's over there.
[14:28.21]Oh, this is gonna be a good one right here.
[14:29.39]I love this.
[14:32.65]Ugh.
[14:34.38]I hope there's wicked dirty houses, too.
[14:40.78]I gotta switch nozzles and stuff.
[14:42.12]I gotta do the first coat first, though.
[14:48.14]You're zirking off to power washing porn.
[14:52.75]Now, I love these videos.
[14:53.87]They really are... If you really have trouble sleeping... Like, that's very loud.
[14:58.17]I gotta turn that down.
[14:59.95]Um... You know, oh, I have, like, the beach sound effects.
[15:06.23]I have the, oh, it just plays the ocean.
[15:07.93]It just plays the outside.
[15:08.95]No, no, no.
[15:09.63]I want log cutting videos.
[15:13.87]Because every, like, hour, one eye will open.
[15:16.89]And I'll just open one eye and just see, like... Oh, yeah.
[15:22.19]And then I'll go back to bed.
[15:23.35]Alright, these windows are dirty.
[15:28.52]What's going on?
[15:30.94]I love this game, by the way.
[15:32.14]This is so much fun.
[15:35.16]The body's still dirty.
[15:36.00]I gotta switch nozzles.
[15:38.12]What does this one mean?
[15:41.70]That's... Force!
[15:46.33]This is so much better than I thought it was going to be.
[15:48.73]This is such a fun game.
[15:50.27]Because that's more pressure.
[15:55.93]Okay.
[16:03.14]There's even more grime on this thing.
[16:04.92]Hold on.
[16:11.10]Just go outside.
[16:12.00]What do you mean just go outside?
[16:19.13]You're using that wrong.
[16:20.19]That term, you're using that wrong.
[16:25.40]I don't have a car to power wash.
[16:28.24]This is not like I'm up playing soccer or football or anything.
[16:36.19]Dude, just go outside.
[16:37.33]This is an elaborate power washing device.
[16:39.63]I don't have one of these.
[16:43.97]I'm getting 100%.
[16:44.35]There's a removals van outside my nightmare neighbor's place.
[16:48.46]They're finally going.
[16:49.26]Whoever moves in there is going to need a quality pressure washer.
[16:51.64]I'm your guy.
[16:52.08]That's my favorite part.
[16:56.94]Right there.
[17:02.98]That's my favorite part of any car wash.
[17:06.11]Because the water just like spins all in there and gets all in there.
[17:09.27]Flies around out in your face and stuff.
[17:10.65]I love it.
[17:15.08]You got a raid?
[17:15.64]Who raided?
[17:17.60]You see?
[17:19.51]Oh, RT game prep!
[17:21.65]What's going on, RT?
[17:22.37]Thanks for the raid.
[17:26.45]What's going on, RT gamers?
[17:34.19]Playing Power Washer Simulator.
[17:37.19]RT is a swell, swell lad.
[17:39.09]If you do not follow RT, what's wrong with you?
[17:46.69]Oh, thanks a lot, dude.
[17:47.71]Welcome, everybody.
[17:52.55]Raid song.
[17:54.36]I don't do raid songs anymore.
[17:57.52]At this point, the raid song is becoming like a fucking reunion show.
[18:01.88]You understand?
[18:03.06]Like, how many times do you want me to do the raid song before we go through like ten seasons of raid songs?
[18:08.06]And now it's just so- I don't even want to hear the raid song anymore.
[18:21.48]Press R to rotate.
[18:23.16]Oh my god, thank you for saving this whole stream.
[18:28.90]I love it.
[18:30.34]Let's rotate.
[18:31.92]Thinner.
[18:36.57]This is just one of my- I'm living one of my favorite videos.
[18:41.39]I can just see like the dirt kicking out underneath that flap.
[18:46.37]I love it.
[18:46.93]This is so good.
[18:48.63]This might be boring to watch.
[18:50.35]Oh, whatever.
[18:52.61]This is the rest of my life is right now.
[18:58.45]Flip it.
[18:59.19]There we go.
[19:02.95]You can crouch too.
[19:04.11]There's a crouch.
[19:04.85]Oh my god.
[19:06.05]I love it.
[19:07.15]Okay.
[19:07.41]I got to stop being like the person at the restaurant.
[19:10.87]That tries everybody's plate.
[19:13.39]And goes.
[19:13.99]Oh my god.
[19:14.47]I love it.
[19:15.39]Oh my god.
[19:15.80]So good.
[19:16.72]Wow.
[19:17.14]What did you get?
[19:20.76]I just keep saying that.
[19:22.81]Look at how much distilled extra dirt.
[19:34.70]And the worst part is when you get somebody that does that.
[19:37.64]And you can tell that they like your food way more than their food.
[19:43.30]So they start like, yeah, yeah, go try mine.
[19:45.02]Try mine.
[19:45.38]I'm going to give you a bunch of my spaghetti.
[19:47.65]Like, oh, I don't want all your spaghetti.
[19:49.33]Go try my spaghetti.
[19:50.93]Try my spaghetti.
[19:52.69]And then you realize that they gave you a huge portion of their food.
[19:56.56]So now you are obligated to be like, oh, well, you know, here, I get, have, you might, you gave me a lot of your, have some of mine.
[20:01.86]Oh, yeah, sure, I'll try it.
[20:03.98]And they scoop off, like, half of your fucking plate.
[20:08.66]Like, you didn't get the fucking, you didn't, like, sorry, you got the filet mignon.
[20:13.56]I got the, come on.
[20:19.92]What restaurant are we in, by the way?
[20:23.03]I hate that.
[20:23.59]I ordered... That's not relatable anymore?
[20:31.41]That's no longer relatable.
[20:33.41]What?
[20:35.29]Because I said filet mignon?
[20:38.48]No, let's change it to McDonald's.
[20:40.22]I love that place.
[20:41.38]And that happens to me all the time.
[20:48.38]Billionaire Billy.
[20:49.60]No, that's not what I mean.
[20:50.68]I was just saying a random food.
[20:56.49]Ever seen water pressure videos?
[20:58.27]I missed what you said, but yeah, I love water videos.
[21:00.73]I gotta get the roof!
[21:03.52]Wait, is this still dirty?
[21:05.22]How is this still dirty?
[21:08.04]Oh shit.
[21:12.86]I bet you eat caviar.
[21:13.80]I think caviar is fucking disgusting.
[21:18.86]I'm sorry, I don't- I think that's gross.
[21:26.96]I'll tell you why I think caviar is disgusting.
[21:28.76]It has nothing to do with how the thing tastes.
[21:31.75]The reason why I think caviar is disgusting is the same reason why I wouldn't open up 12 eggs and scoop them out into a fucking cup and drink them like a bodybuilder.
[21:41.71]I don't want to eat raw eggs.
[21:43.41]I don't want to just like drink eggs.
[21:56.52]Why am I getting question marks?
[21:57.44]Do you guys know what caviar is?
[22:09.75]Drink the eggs.
[22:14.03]Have you actually tried caviar?
[22:17.17]Who?
[22:17.43]Yeah, oh, who?
[22:21.42]Who's that?
[22:22.28]You hooing caviar?
[22:25.09]Why are you hooing caviar?
[22:26.72]It's not like a streamer.
[22:28.34]Alright, change that nozzle.
[22:32.58]High pressure, let's go.
[22:38.83]You gotta get the corners of the windows and then the middle.
[22:47.81]Dermot, stop.
[22:48.31]You're not using any soap.
[22:50.70]What?
[22:56.39]You know, what do you mean soap?
[22:57.56]I don't need soap.
[22:57.98]It's a power washer.
[23:06.40]It's just the pressure of the nozzle takes out all the dirt, all the grime, all the filth, and you don't need soap.
[23:15.81]Isn't that what they say in the commercials?
[23:19.45]All done with the power of steam and liquid.
[23:24.28]Yeah, you don't need soap.
[23:29.22]Stop.
[23:29.58]What?
[23:34.91]Get down here.
[23:35.39]I mean, that was a really just half-assed impression, but I'm busy enjoying this.
[23:45.85]You're going to need to go with that business name.
[23:48.29]You need to think something up.
[23:49.19]I'm phenomenal.
[23:50.33]I thought of routing Thomas for that Tyler, and she's never looked back.
[23:54.59]What?
[24:07.40]You know, they really are hitting a completely untapped market here.
[24:14.10]You're ignoring the story?
[24:15.04]Alright, so what do... I see a red canister.
[24:23.71]BOOM!
[24:26.99]I would never shoot a pressure washer at like a propane tank.
[24:31.09]None of this stuff can even move, so don't worry.
[24:32.81]Did I clean the ground too?
[24:38.84]Alright, what do I need?
[24:39.72]The body is still... Ah!
[24:47.43]Okay, cool.
[24:48.03]That's cool.
[24:49.13]Cool.
[24:49.41]Alrighty, the mirrors.
[24:51.01]Don't forget about your mirrors!
[24:53.90]Turn it off!
[25:00.48]How is the body still this dirty?
[25:04.62]This is gonna be such a huge moment for me.
[25:06.66]I love it.
[25:07.08]Here we go.
[25:07.62]Stop saying I love it.
[25:08.78]Stop taking people's spaghetti.
[25:22.25]It wasn't a perfect line, but it was good enough.
[25:24.57]Let's go wider.
[25:32.35]Just like the video.
[25:34.33]Yeah, you gotta do it just like the video.
[25:35.82]It's gonna be like swoops.
[25:37.70]They do these huge sweeps.
[25:45.20]Yep.
[25:45.90]You got it.
[25:46.30]You're right.
[25:46.88]Exactly right.
[25:56.99]Use the jetpack?
[26:04.07]Alright, I got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[26:05.67]How much more is there left to do?
[26:07.56]This car is clean.
[26:13.76]There we go.
[26:14.24]Alright, body is cleaned.
[26:18.78]Oh, back here.
[26:25.29]Door is clean.
[26:26.05]Everything's clean here.
[26:27.67]Window, door, glass.
[26:28.87]What's that?
[26:29.13]What else?
[26:31.45]Oh, right here.
[26:31.99]This is gross.
[26:35.94]This'll be it for this one.
[26:41.38]What's dirty in the window?
[26:43.88]Where is it?
[26:49.09]Got it, okay.
[26:51.01]99% cleaned.
[26:51.39]Fire?
[26:59.26]What else?
[27:01.86]Grill?
[27:05.97]No, that's clean, man.
[27:11.07]It is the grill, but where?
[27:15.00]Up underneath the lights?
[27:21.08]What?
[27:21.34]99%.
[27:21.36]Alright, where's the rest of it?
[27:24.96]Mirrors?
[27:30.01]Other mirror?
[27:31.79]Press tab.
[27:32.81]Oh, shit!
[27:36.77]I feel like that's kind of cheating, don't you think?
[27:43.37]Come on.
[27:43.87]Where is this?
[27:46.71]It's just cheating vision.
[27:47.83]It is.
[27:51.07]I'm pressing tab.
[27:51.67]I don't see anything.
[27:53.85]Oh, it's the tire.
[27:54.41]Okay.
[28:05.20]Oh my god, how am I ever supposed to get all that?
[28:12.86]Another tire?
[28:13.74]Yep.
[28:15.82]I did it.
[28:17.98]Job complete.
[28:19.12]Open the tablet.
[28:23.17]Wait, is that showing everything I did?
[28:24.69]That's awesome.
[28:28.93]It shows the video of what you did.
[28:31.19]That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.
[28:35.06]How efficient was that?
[28:40.52]You probably would do the top first, probably.
[28:45.78]Okay, cool.
[28:46.60]So now I got 150 bucks.
[28:49.70]Continue.
[28:51.19]Clean the back garden.
[28:54.29]This is 400 bucks.
[28:55.83]What about the store?
[28:58.03]Power washers.
[28:58.95]A range of washers from small home units to industrial ones.
[29:02.49]Cleaning liquids.
[29:04.62]Glass cleaner.
[29:06.74]Metal cleaner.
[29:07.46]Plastic cleaner.
[29:08.36]Universal cleaner.
[29:12.64]Just get the universal one.
[29:13.48]Just put it on everything.
[29:16.09]From all surface materials.
[29:20.41]Yeah, why would I not get the... What do you mean no?
[29:24.01]Buy all the cleaners.
[29:25.21]It's more expensive.
[29:26.05]Yeah, buy five bucks.
[29:36.84]Buy the stone.
[29:37.86]Buy the stone.
[29:38.90]Stone cleaner.
[29:39.62]I thought this said grass.
[29:43.68]Okay.
[29:46.78]Equipment.
[29:47.38]Prime Vista 1500 Turbo Nozzle.
[29:52.35]Oh, shit.
[29:52.91]That sounds pretty good.
[29:55.13]Proves the range while still being able to be used quite close to surfaces.
[30:00.43]Soap Nozzle.
[30:05.52]Okay, I need the turbo nozzle.
[30:07.71]And then I need this short extension.
[30:10.23]I want to save my money.
[30:10.97]Hold on.
[30:11.25]I don't want to just buy a bunch of shit.
[30:12.63]Power washers.
[30:16.59]This is what I have right now.
[30:17.50]Surface, encrusted, embedded.
[30:19.06]This is awesome!
[30:21.68]This is awesome.
[30:22.44]Everybody at the dinner table, give me all of your plates.
[30:26.38]I'm eating all of your food.
[30:28.16]All of it.
[30:29.25]I'm eating everything.
[30:32.66]I want to try all your food till there's nothing left on the plate.
[30:36.40]And I'll give each of you 50 bucks.
[30:39.36]That fair?
[30:39.74]Fair.
[30:44.92]Medium.
[30:45.62]Oh, heavy duty.
[30:46.74]Professional duty.
[30:47.68]How much are these?
[30:48.20]2,000.
[30:49.04]Alright, we're good.
[30:50.22]Let's go.
[30:58.11]Why don't you just order food?
[31:03.75]Okay, I think I know what you mean.
[31:05.63]Like, why would I just give everybody $50?
[31:07.67]Why wouldn't I just order everybody's entrees?
[31:10.19]Because the entrees were like $30.
[31:11.19]$20.
[31:14.09]Why wouldn't I just order three or four of the things that they had?
[31:17.97]I see what you mean.
[31:20.17]Yeah, okay.
[31:20.71]Alright, let's keep going.
[31:27.17]Career.
[31:28.72]Garden time.
[31:29.32]Let's do it.
[31:31.34]This one's gonna be fun.
[31:32.42]I'm gonna clean the grass, too.
[31:38.61]Don't tell him.
[31:39.07]We're gonna get 50 bucks.
[31:42.13]Uh, Doc, I hope you like a challenge, because I'm pretty sure I've got the dirtiest backyard you've ever seen.
[31:46.39]Mm-hmm.
[31:49.31]That's not me bragging, by the way.
[31:50.41]I had nothing to do with it.
[31:51.42]I just moved back to town for a bit to help my folks.
[31:54.08]We're both down to their last knee and rented what I thought was a great little place.
[31:58.63]Anyway, my girls are itching to get out there.
[32:00.49]I don't want them still itching when they get back.
[32:02.19]Alright, I'll clean the grass.
[32:03.85]Let's go.
[32:09.42]Do I have the new nozzle?
[32:13.78]Oh, this backyard's not... This is nothing.
[32:15.02]This would take ten minutes.
[32:18.68]I need... How do I... How do I equip the nozzle?
[32:24.94]Is it already on?
[32:29.20]Oh, here we go.
[32:29.60]Alright, Prime Vista Turbo Nozzle.
[32:32.78]That's what's on.
[32:35.84]Why is it doing that?
[32:36.50]It just makes figure eights?
[32:45.75]Well, shit.
[32:46.27]How am I supposed to... Put on the extension nozzle.
[32:54.33]This is all over the place.
[32:55.63]Alright, well, let's go for it.
[33:00.07]No, I hate that.
[33:01.01]Take it off now.
[33:01.87]Get it off.
[33:08.63]What the fuck happened in here?
[33:14.03]Don't stop saying Aaron.
[33:14.89]Alright, we're going to start with the... We're going to start with the walls.
[33:20.83]The fence.
[33:24.79]Leave a little pressure.
[33:27.67]This is wood.
[33:29.27]How do I put the soap on?
[33:32.76]Here we go.
[33:33.34]Universal cleaner.
[33:34.26]Equipped.
[33:34.58]Is it on?
[33:43.42]I think it's on, right?
[33:44.46]Is it?
[33:53.95]I just want the neighbor to come out and be like, what the hell?
[33:55.55]Why is there a bunch of drawings?
[33:56.93]I'm just going to draw like, fuck you on the side of their house.
[34:02.72]You need a soap nozzle?
[34:07.88]At the tops, don't, hold on.
[34:11.72]You didn't buy the soap nozzle.
[34:13.14]Oh, well, whatever.
[34:26.87]Oh, this is stuff.
[34:28.45]I can't.
[34:29.27]I have to say it, but I don't want.
[34:32.44]Okay, I'm not going to say it.
[34:39.68]Are you guys going to be ordering dessert?
[34:41.79]No, I'm stuffed.
[34:44.89]How come we just can't say no?
[34:47.47]Just say no, I don't want dessert.
[34:50.68]No, fuck, just kill the waiter.
[34:52.00]I... Oh, I would.
[34:53.49]Oh, I'd like... Just like, so much food.
[34:54.89]Look at all this stuff.
[34:56.99]Just say, I don't fucking want dessert.
[34:58.79]Why does it make us look bad?
[34:59.85]I always make up like an elaborate story as to why I don't want to order dessert.
[35:15.98]I don't want the waiter to think I'm like a weirdo or something.
[35:22.93]Quit saying we when it's only you.
[35:24.90]No, I know a lot of people do this shit, not just me.
[35:27.36]What was that?
[35:44.09]You're crazy.
[35:44.79]I'm... I don't know.
[35:46.33]I always have this thing in my brain.
[35:48.13]Where if a waiter or waitress comes over and they're like, Oh, would you like to see our dessert menu?
[35:52.60]And it's like, no.
[35:54.24]Just like, oh, well, you don't even want to look at it?
[35:57.54]Why?
[35:57.76]I don't want it.
[36:01.60]I know that's never going to happen, but it's this weird thing in my brain that it's going to happen.
[36:06.29]So instead of having to say no and be like, well, you don't want to even look at it?
[36:10.35]I just go, I make up like an elaborate tale of why I can't eat dessert today.
[36:15.59]Say no thank you.
[36:16.47]I know, that's simple, but there has to be like a reason why I can't eat it.
[36:22.93]Like, I lean back and I put my hands on my belly and I like just rub and I go, oh, I would, but whoa!
[36:43.48]That's weirder.
[36:52.61]Did he get to the horror part yet?
[36:54.13]Oh, ban that guy.
[36:56.03]Is that real?
[36:56.73]I'm just kidding.
[36:57.15]Don't ban him.
[36:57.61]I know it's not real.
[37:01.79]If you say, whoa, ho, ho, ho, out of waiter, you should tip them $50.
[37:08.21]My base line of tipping is at least 20%.
[37:12.11]That's the base.
[37:13.67]It only goes up from there.
[37:25.66]21%, no.
[37:32.51]I hate, okay, what I'm saying right now is the equivalent of, so if we go to a restaurant or something, if you go somewhere, you sit down with some friends and that's like actually telling the waiter, oh, by the way, I just want to let you know, I'm a good tipper.
[37:47.88]Doesn't that always seem to be the case that that person tips like 12%?
[38:01.20]Or like 8% or something.
[38:03.70]That's a lot of community subs.
[38:07.02]Void880, thanks for the... Hold on a minute.
[38:09.82]Hey, Void.
[38:10.38]Hold on.
[38:15.27]Hey, Void.
[38:15.87]Hey, Void880, thanks for the community subs.
[38:38.67]I was spelling the name.
[38:39.39]It's hard to spell.
[38:42.33]With a power washer.
[38:45.79]No, I... I know that saying that I tip well means I don't tip well.
[38:50.71]I just think I do for some reason.
[38:55.91]It's like, well, you think 7% is a good tip?
[39:00.45]Of course I think it's a good tip.
[39:01.83]What do you mean it's a tip?
[39:03.11]It's a very generous tip.
[39:06.02]They forgot to fill my water, by the way.
[39:08.04]They didn't fill my water up twice.
[39:09.96]I mean, do you see how many people are in this place right now?
[39:25.16]I thought the waiter was pretty good.
[39:30.26]No, and you know what?
[39:31.62]I heard a sneeze.
[39:33.61]I heard a sneeze.
[39:36.11]So, I don't like this place.
[39:40.27]Okay.
[39:44.48]Nice run.
[39:50.28]This one needs the more powerful one, definitely.
[39:52.60]Oh, yeah.
[39:54.24]This one needs the, yeah.
[40:02.67]That's how you get in there.
[40:10.29]You fucking up the flower beds?
[40:14.11]Oh, I guess I kind of am, aren't I?
[40:20.85]You gotta stand back.
[40:21.69]Yeah, that's better.
[40:25.47]My dentist uses this one.
[40:26.81]I actually love this thing at the dentist.
[40:40.11]I know we have talked about this, but there's a lot of new people on this channel, and we have to go over this again.
[40:46.15]Everybody here hates getting their teeth scaled, right?
[40:49.29]They fucking hate it.
[40:50.68]Everybody here.
[40:52.82]Right?
[40:58.00]No, no.
[40:58.74]No, actually, like, see, this is what I don't understand.
[41:02.16]There are a bunch of people that like getting their teeth scaled.
[41:07.68]That, it sucks.
[41:09.08]It's horrible.
[41:10.04]It's one of the worst things I've ever, it's one of the worst fucking things.
[41:16.62]Scaling, if you don't know what scaling is, it's that little knife hook that they scrape your teeth gum line with.
[41:24.14]It's the worst thing on Earth.
[41:35.26]Yeah, I hate it.
[41:36.68]Who wants that?
[41:38.71]There's a bunch of people that like it.
[41:40.67]It's at least like 20-30% of people that actually like it.
[41:42.75]I know a handful of people that I've come across.
[41:44.80]Friends, family.
[41:45.98]I know people that like it.
[41:46.94]They're like, oh yeah, it feels good.
[41:52.18]But the reason why I bring it up is because they have one.
[41:55.54]It's like a water scaler.
[41:57.12]It goes like this.
[41:57.70]And they do that like all over your gums and stuff.
[42:00.48]And I much prefer it over the scraping.
[42:10.77]Sorry, I don't go to the dentist.
[42:16.47]Oh.
[42:18.07]Then you missed out on the goodie bag.
[42:20.88]Don't tell him about the goodie bag.
[42:29.79]Never been to the dentist before.
[42:30.97]You missed out.
[42:31.85]Mm-hmm.
[42:39.63]People that have no idea what I'm talking about, they're like, what do you mean the goodie bag?
[42:43.02]Oh.
[42:43.78]Some of these people talking about no goodie bag?
[42:47.26]Okay.
[42:57.73]I still get the goodie bag.
[43:04.01]Alright, tell me if I'm crazy, because I need to know.
[43:07.63]Did you guys, when you were a kid, go to the dentist?
[43:10.63]And after you were done, you got to go to, like, the toy center.
[43:15.44]And they had these little, like, small, cheap toys.
[43:18.72]It was like a big treasure chest that you could go, like, get toys from.
[43:23.17]That was awesome.
[43:23.99]That was the best part.
[43:29.62]When I still go to the dentist, when they're done, I go, oh, it was fun.
[43:35.23]Cotton in my mouth.
[43:37.27]Can I get a toy?
[43:38.27]Can I go to the toy box?
[43:42.05]And it's not even weird.
[43:42.83]They don't even care.
[43:47.11]Okay, don't do that.
[43:48.09]I'm sorry.
[43:52.35]I'm trying to, here's the thing about those toys that you got from the dentist.
[43:56.66]I- I have this, like, memory.
[43:59.36]I can't remember any of them.
[44:01.40]They were all so... strange.
[44:05.07]It was like a device where you pressed a button and it made little water come up, like, colored- blue colored water or something.
[44:11.45]Like, I- they don't even have real toys.
[44:16.50]One of them had like a, I'm making this up, but a string attached to like a little bicycle thing and you turn the wheel and the string would fly around.
[44:25.69]I don't remember any of them.
[44:29.81]They were only in the dentist office.
[44:31.32]I've never seen them ever again.
[44:37.16]Sticky hand.
[44:39.18]Oh yeah, they did have sticky hands.
[44:40.39]You're right.
[44:46.27]Bouncy balls?
[44:46.91]I don't remember bouncy balls.
[44:47.92]I remember the weird, like, the rings.
[44:49.80]Yeah, it was the thing with the... I remember that.
[44:51.86]In the water.
[44:57.08]Alright, this is still dirty, but I'm gonna have to come back to it.
[44:59.16]There's still a shitload of dirt on here.
[45:01.34]Where is it, though?
[45:04.52]Oh.
[45:06.08]I've done that before.
[45:07.42]I've done that before.
[45:08.26]How many of you guys have done yard work or helped around the house?
[45:13.27]I've done that a bunch of times.
[45:16.30]Or you just don't do the insides.
[45:19.70]You just do this, and you don't do the insides or the back.
[45:30.93]You just want to be done.
[45:31.97]Okay, I'll do the other side after.
[45:37.81]Alright, should I do the patio furniture first?
[45:44.19]You should do that while painting.
[45:46.74]Well, I mean, with paint, you have to paint the pens.
[45:49.24]You can't just... What?
[45:54.40]So the only... Yeah.
[45:55.44]I don't know what... Something when I was like a teenager for some reason.
[45:59.32]But just being able to view it from this angle and it looking clean was enough for me to think that my parents weren't going to care.
[46:08.28]Just this picture, this snapshot was like, I did it.
[46:11.00]It's done.
[46:11.92]Oh, yeah, it is done.
[46:13.64]And then that's all it took for them to look.
[46:17.05]That only worked for about two minutes before they came outside.
[46:22.05]And the weird teenager brain was like, yeah, that's enough to like fool them for me to be able to ride my bike down the street now.
[46:32.80]I already told you guys how I mowed the lawn.
[46:34.30]Everybody thought I was crazy.
[46:37.08]How I used to mow the lawn was I thought it was a genius idea.
[46:41.14]Was I just did a giant circle.
[46:45.92]And just every time I kept going, I went a little bit more further on the line, and I just kept going in a circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, till it was done in the middle.
[46:58.29]That's how you do it.
[47:01.53]I did that too.
[47:02.15]Yeah, but the correct way is you go, is like, you're not supposed to be like, just do a big spiral, right?
[47:15.76]That's a great way to do it.
[47:16.68]Alright, if you hired somebody to do this and you looked outside and they were going like this.
[47:35.59]But they still did the job well.
[47:38.70]What's the scenario?
[47:39.66]Like, let's say they did that.
[47:41.89]Is the scenario... you... don't call them back?
[47:46.90]You just go, thanks, I appreciate it, thanks for the power wash, and you just don't call them back to do it again?
[47:52.14]Or do you say, hey, stop doing that?
[48:03.65]Clean the car.
[48:04.31]I, I, hold on, I'm getting clean overwhelming here.
[48:07.01]Oh, there's so much dirty shit.
[48:19.88]Is this doing it?
[48:21.86]Yep.
[48:25.58]It's like rust.
[48:26.32]Can I get it with this?
[48:26.98]Oh, we gotta go harder.
[48:32.44]That feels so awesome.
[48:38.02]What a simple concept.
[48:45.37]It's perfect.
[48:51.17]Alright, how many of you guys used to stand out here like this and pretend you had a flamethrower?
[49:02.00]Spray it up and down.
[49:02.76]I remember if you stood far enough away.
[49:07.72]So let's say, for instance, if somebody was there where the birdhouse is.
[49:13.63]I remember my brother used to stand really far back and just go like this.
[49:18.96]And there would just be this mist that would overtake the whole area.
[49:22.08]Did I ever tell you guys about how I used to put on hockey equipment and my brother used to throw baseballs at me?
[49:39.02]I did, right?
[49:45.58]Let me give context, let me give context.
[49:47.12]Context, context matters.
[49:48.30]Listen, listen, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:49.94]The context matters, just wait.
[49:52.60]So, I have an older brother.
[49:56.08]And he was a pitcher.
[49:59.06]So he was like, when he was younger, he was like, you know, in middle school and high school.
[50:03.53]He was a pitcher, he played on baseball teams and stuff.
[50:05.35]And I played baseball too, but I wasn't nearly as good, right?
[50:08.83]So, he always wanted to practice pitching.
[50:11.52]But at the house, it was just like, oh, who do you practice with?
[50:14.58]Do you want to like practice?
[50:16.22]I want to like try some new pitches.
[50:18.50]And I was not very good.
[50:20.68]And I was like, I was always so scared of getting like drilled with a baseball.
[50:26.17]So we put me in a bunch of hockey equipment, like a hockey mask, hockey pads.
[50:31.11]I looked ridiculous.
[50:32.12]I had that bunch of like a football pads on, helmet, everything.
[50:35.94]And I would just sit out there with a glove.
[50:38.24]And he would just, like, just gun him at me.
[50:41.10]Like, just whip him at me.
[50:42.10]And, like, it would be like, like, it would hit me in the chest sometimes because I couldn't catch very well.
[50:47.17]But I wanted to, like, help.
[50:48.21]I wanted to, like, let him practice.
[50:53.59]Half the time, the ball would just hit me, like, somewhere in the chest or, like, the knees or, like, the face.
[50:58.92]But I had a ton of, I was covered.
[51:01.38]I think I even had pillows all over me, too.
[51:05.74]Yeah, we taped pillows to my arms and stuff, so it didn't matter.
[51:14.08]And on the one or two times that I caught it, it would hurt.
[51:16.48]It hurt.
[51:19.94]And I kind of didn't want to catch it.
[51:22.58]Because he'd be like, alright, here comes another one.
[51:24.44]I'm going to try fastball.
[51:26.56]And it'd be like, oh, that sucks.
[51:30.85]That sucks.
[51:32.59]So eventually I just like started pretending like I was terrible and just let them hit me in the chest and like the face and stuff.
[51:38.42]Because it didn't hurt.
[51:43.90]You're explaining the story from the Mighty Ducks.
[51:49.49]This happened though.
[51:50.43]This actually happened.
[51:57.05]And it got to a point where he would, he would be like, you know, it'd be after school or something.
[52:01.27]He'd be like, hey, hey Jeremy, you want to put the hockey pads on?
[52:04.27]And I'm like, yeah, I want to put the hockey pads on.
[52:11.68]And that translated to a bunch of different activities that I could just, I was going to never get hurt.
[52:15.88]I would never get hurt.
[52:26.55]It was like a little brother suit of armor that I would put on.
[52:28.99]Alright, this is clean, right?
[52:34.37]There's one little piece that's not.
[52:35.79]Where is it?
[52:36.15]There it is.
[52:42.35]Would he beat you up in the gear, too?
[52:43.79]I mean, like, maybe sometimes.
[52:53.16]Like, he would just, like, scoop slam me or something.
[53:00.93]But it was, it was, we were like doing something.
[53:03.91]It was like, oh, we're going to play like fighters or something.
[53:06.43]Oh, I'm going to get the hockey pads.
[53:15.34]If we were going to do any outdoor activity and it required us to like do anything really active, I would probably just put the hockey pads on because I just didn't want to.
[53:22.81]What do you mean sometimes?
[53:25.63]Eating you up.
[53:26.27]No, no.
[53:27.01]This was like we were having like fun.
[53:30.59]As brothers.
[53:31.81]And it was like, you know what?
[53:34.42]I'll put the pillows on my arms.
[53:35.91]Just in case I don't get hurt.
[53:53.29]Repressed memory.
[53:54.86]I just told you that it was like, it was fun to put the hockey pads on and like play baseball and like run outside and do weird shit.
[54:02.40]And like play fighters and stuff.
[54:08.34]Guys, they made a product called Sock-em-boppers.
[54:11.94]Okay, oh, what are you talking about?
[54:14.23]Your brother used to like, you used to put pillows on and your brother would like throw, hold on a minute.
[54:18.69]Wait, wait.
[54:19.49]There was a fucking product where you put these air gloves on and beat the shit out of each other.
[54:26.63]This was not abnormal.
[54:35.56]Sock and boppers, sock and boppers, it's more fun than a pillow fight!
[54:42.43]Yeah, you put on these kids boxing gloves and just beat each other up.
[55:00.62]Memory unlocked I and now that I think about it.
[55:03.28]It's like so there was a company that they really wanted to go like a pillow fight like people like Like brothers and sisters or party or something you're like just hitting each other with pillows that you know you've got to be careful Let's make kids boxing gloves.
[55:16.19]It's like wait what I didn't I missed a spot.
[55:25.88]I just got it
[55:31.67]Here we go, alright, there it is.
[55:40.43]Don't crouch, it's bad for your back.
[55:47.24]It was no ad, your brother made a fake ad so he could beat you up with those.
[55:52.78]Well, when my brother was fucking like 12 or 13 or something, he sure was like a really great, like, engineer of plastic material.
[56:02.23]I don't know where he did that.
[56:03.67]Well, that's very interesting.
[56:06.23]He had his own, like, factory, I guess.
[56:15.45]Oh, that's really dirty.
[56:16.66]Get rid of that.
[56:22.16]Still on there somewhere.
[56:23.00]Where?
[56:25.88]Where is it?
[56:26.30]Got it.
[56:32.64]Oh, that's very interesting.
[56:35.86]Oh, that's right, it's dirt vision, you're right.
[56:41.81]Sorry, I just had to take a quick shower.
[56:49.89]Stop juggling.
[56:50.69]What is the age difference between you and your brother?
[56:58.04]Uh...
[57:03.30]30 years?
[57:14.59]It's one star.
[57:15.35]I'm not gonna just leave the job.
[57:17.55]I'm in the middle of doing this.
[57:18.91]It takes a while.
[57:31.11]Somebody in a pre-stream was just... I caught it.
[57:34.62]I caught it.
[57:35.40]Look, I saw it.
[57:35.92]They said, what the fuck is that from?
[57:38.70]Please tell me.
[57:39.44]I need to know.
[57:42.17]And I can tell you, an old sound effect, they used to put in lots of stuff back in like the early 90s, mid 2000s, early 2000s.
[57:53.98]One where it's the most prevalent is the first boss of The Simpsons arcade game.
[57:59.80]He goes, and it's been stuck in my head for years and I can never get rid of it.
[58:05.02]And I just do it sometimes.
[58:09.36]But it was used a lot.
[58:11.60]I love cleaning rocks.
[58:15.60]I just got here.
[58:16.06]Has it been funny yet?
[58:17.02]Oh my god.
[58:17.48]You have no idea.
[58:18.24]You missed so many funny stories.
[58:19.68]You missed so many funny things.
[58:20.94]You missed like I couldn't put the nozzle on right for like 20 minutes.
[58:23.02]And everyone was like pretending Pog.
[58:24.74]Pretending Andy.
[58:25.96]It was awesome.
[58:38.65]This one's done.
[58:39.19]I don't even know.
[58:40.37]Sometimes you clean it twice.
[58:47.63]This is good?
[58:52.29]Where is it?
[58:52.69]It's somewhere in here.
[58:54.95]Fence post.
[58:55.89]Come on.
[58:56.48]Get it.
[58:56.76]Fence panel.
[59:04.12]Fence post.
[59:04.70]This is all good.
[59:05.30]Alright.
[59:07.38]I don't see anything.
[59:09.74]Here we go.
[59:19.33]I don't need that nozzle.
[59:20.19]Let's... Yeah, there we go.
[59:26.68]Wouldn't this fuck up the lawnmower?
[59:27.96]I have to imagine that spraying water inside of an engine is probably not a good idea.
[59:38.29]Very dirty, though.
[59:41.82]Oh, if you want to know what we're doing next week, there's a couple of things that are going on next week, I'll tell you.
[59:46.96]So, first of all, um, E3 is this coming weekend, so that's perfect timing.
[59:54.02]Perfect timing.
[59:56.10]I am going to stream on Saturday, I'm going to do the Microsoft conference and then whatever's after that.
[60:00.63]I'm not going to do, I don't really care about the Ubisoft conference.
[60:05.61]I really don't.
[60:06.73]I don't think it's, I really don't think it's worth me streaming that conference.
[60:15.22]We'll do Microsoft and we'll do Square Enix.
[60:19.30]And then... That same stream... I don't even... I might even just say, like, oh, thanks.
[60:29.22]It's my 10-year anniversary.
[60:31.24]Being online on YouTube and Twitch.
[60:34.63]That's happening, I think, on... That's, like, Thursday of this week coming up.
[60:39.69]It's the actual 10-year anniversary.
[60:45.75]So, I don't really have anything planned or anything.
[60:48.85]I was kind of just going to bring it up.
[60:54.19]I guess I just already did.
[60:57.74]What's the best bird shit nozzle?
[60:58.90]Probably this one.
[61:02.04]You're so old.
[61:03.04]I know.
[61:03.28]I am so old.
[61:08.24]And I'm just getting older.
[61:16.92]I can go wider, can't I?
[61:19.65]Yeah.
[61:21.85]I need to buy that soap nozzle.
[61:22.91]This probably goes so much quicker.
[61:29.37]Yeah, if I don't address it for some reason on next weekend's stream, then... Yeah, I started doing YouTube when I was like 25.
[61:43.76]And here I am at 35.
[61:45.82]Yes, that's how old I am.
[61:46.78]People think I'm like... I don't know why.
[61:48.44]People think I'm like 23 or something.
[61:52.62]I might act like a fucking 25 year old.
[61:55.12]But I'm 35 and I pay taxes.
[62:00.96]No, they don't.
[62:08.81]But yeah, I don't know.
[62:10.03]I have no idea what my future looks like.
[62:12.51]I don't know.
[62:16.31]10 years ago, if you told me that I was going to be continuing to do this 10 years later, I would have been like, I don't think so.
[62:24.95]I have no idea.
[62:27.37]It's surprising that this many people are even here anyway, so.
[62:34.37]This is still dirty.
[62:36.26]Oh, it's this.
[62:36.74]Alright, let's get it.
[62:47.24]A little deeper, come on.
[62:56.03]Yeah.
[62:56.49]Ew, I've been watching you for 10 years.
[62:59.95]Ew?
[63:00.27]What do you mean, ew?
[63:03.19]Why do you say ew?
[63:06.41]How am I going to get on the roof?
[63:11.51]Is there a ladder?
[63:14.69]How do I clean that?
[63:16.87]Do I just have to jump?
[63:25.70]Holy shit.
[63:28.49]Okay, I guess I could... I'm gonna take advantage of this.
[63:46.80]Climb.
[63:48.52]You need the propeller?
[63:57.39]Okay.
[64:01.09]I would just open up the backslider at this point, like the back door or whatever, and just be like, Ah, there's a ladder in the garage, dude.
[64:06.23]Do you need it?
[64:12.47]You don't have to do that.
[64:19.72]I need a... This is very dirty.
[64:21.27]Look at how dirty this is.
[64:22.07]Don't fall off.
[64:40.30]I'm almost there.
[64:47.40]How's it look?
[64:47.86]Look okay?
[64:53.73]I've been watching you since 2013.
[64:55.21]Yeah, and I'll make the same reference here.
[65:00.99]That's very surprising to me.
[65:03.69]Because after seven years of a TV show, we keep using that magic number of seven, after the seventh or eighth season of a TV show, usually people start to get a little tired of it.
[65:14.50]So, I'm surprised that ten years later, the TV show still exists.
[65:31.02]But you're a person.
[65:33.12]Yeah, but still, I mean... Usually there's a pretty finite amount of time that is super, quote, quote, quote, media is seen as worth watching, right?
[65:47.46]Remember, you're The Simpsons of the internet.
[65:49.10]Don't say that.
[65:51.64]Don't say that.
[65:52.06]I think there's like... I think there's like 30 people that still watch The Simpsons.
[65:57.38]I wouldn't say that.
[66:01.52]It could be a great show.
[66:02.40]I have no idea.
[66:03.64]There's a really small amount of people that really enjoy that show still.
[66:10.55]And it might be the best television out there.
[66:12.17]I have no idea.
[66:13.15]I haven't watched it in probably 10 years.
[66:15.57]I've not seen a single episode of The Simpsons since probably like 2018.
[66:26.48]They definitely have, you're 18, 18.8k Andy.
[66:30.13]Well, I didn't say my, I did not say my show is better than The Simpsons.
[66:34.47]I didn't say I have more viewers than The Simpsons.
[66:37.21]I said that maybe three people watch The Simpsons.
[66:41.13]In every city, in every town, in every state, in every country, in every province.
[66:46.84]I did not clarify what I meant by that statement.
[66:48.82]So in actuality, it's probably like a 800,000, 600,000 people.
[66:58.25]Where's this dirt?
[67:15.35]Simpsons for every home.
[67:26.13]I'll tell this story because it's kind of interesting.
[67:28.99]So I was at the pet store.
[67:32.57]This is literally yesterday.
[67:35.21]I was at the pet store.
[67:37.06]I needed to get something for Otto.
[67:38.90]And I did not know where the object was.
[67:41.84]I didn't know where the item was.
[67:44.00]So I walked up to what I thought was one of the employees.
[67:48.55]And I was like, excuse me, we're going to get the dog beds that have the thing so my dog can walk up the stairs.
[67:55.37]Because Otto has like, you know, I don't want him to be jumping or anything.
[67:58.21]So I want him to be able to go on one of those ramps.
[67:59.95]And sometimes they sell them at the pet stores.
[68:01.94]So I'm like, do you guys sell those?
[68:04.86]And the guy goes, I don't work here.
[68:08.92]I was like, what?
[68:10.66]And then the person that they were with was like, are you Jerma?
[68:15.36]I was like, wait, what?
[68:17.06]Wait, I thought you were an employee.
[68:19.39]And I actually went like, oh, what do you mean?
[68:22.49]Jerma, who's that?
[68:23.89]They're like, Jerma, Twitch.
[68:25.05]I was like, what's Twitch?
[68:31.56]And they were just like, it's this pla- you're not Jerma?
[68:36.80]And I was like, and I just went, oh, look at me!
[68:39.09]And I did the look at me thing.
[68:40.19]I don't know, I was like, oh, maybe I'll, like, be funny about it.
[68:45.19]And they were like, you are fucking Jerma.
[68:48.21]You liar.
[68:48.97]And I was like, yeah, it's me.
[68:52.88]So I just, like, was like, I'm sorry.
[68:54.84]I'm really sorry.
[68:55.44]I thought you were, like, I thought you worked here.
[68:57.96]Because they had like a similar shirt on as like what one of the employees had on and they were like, no.
[69:02.46]And I'm like, I'm sorry.
[69:03.50]I didn't mean to.
[69:07.68]This is real.
[69:08.22]I swear to God.
[69:10.72]And they were really nice.
[69:12.52]They were really cool.
[69:13.84]That rarely ever happens, by the way.
[69:19.35]I wanted to talk about it, though.
[69:20.65]The roof is done.
[69:21.39]Alright.
[69:21.67]I got to get off the roof.
[69:22.65]Stop doing the roof.
[69:27.36]But yeah, it was really nice.
[69:29.66]They were really sweet about it.
[69:32.12]I took a picture.
[69:32.68]I was like, oh, that was cool.
[69:34.64]But I just felt like an asshole.
[69:37.38]I felt like an idiot.
[69:38.12]It's a cringe streamer moment.
[69:59.93]What's the weirdest place you've been recognized?
[70:03.37]Um, probably in one of the casinos here.
[70:06.73]Happened to, like, a couple years ago?
[70:11.59]It was just like, hey, I know you.
[70:14.71]It was like, oh, alright.
[70:16.75]That was it.
[70:17.41]That was literally it.
[70:18.91]They just, like, knew that it was me.
[70:22.19]No, like, we didn't talk about really anything.
[70:24.11]It was just kind of like, yeah, I know who you are.
[70:28.16]And then they just went on with their rest of the- Oh, no, no!
[70:30.44]Somebody screamed at me!
[70:31.68]Somebody screamed at me!
[70:33.86]Yeah, somebody screamed at me from a car!
[70:35.40]Oh, I fucking forgot about this!
[70:37.74]I was at a mall!
[70:40.34]And somebody was in the parking lot of the mall, and they drove by, and they were like, And I was like, what the fuck?
[70:46.13]Who is that?
[70:52.35]This was like three or four years ago, I think.
[70:55.87]Yeah.
[70:59.45]They screamed my name and they were in a car.
[71:04.35]And it scared the shit out of me because I was like, wait, who?
[71:07.29]Huh?
[71:08.21]And I think I just waved.
[71:09.21]I was like, hi.
[71:12.63]That was it.
[71:12.97]That was it.
[71:14.41]It was not like, oh, hey, like, let's stop it.
[71:16.77]Like, hey, are you?
[71:17.43]No, nope.
[71:20.57]They just screamed my name.
[71:27.90]That was actually me.
[71:34.02]Whoever you were, I mean, you screamed at me.
[71:36.48]And that was it.
[71:53.66]And, like, if anyone's, like, wondering, if you're, like, curious, I don't care.
[71:58.70]I don't care.
[71:59.18]If, like, if you see me out in public or something, if you happen to think it's me or something, you're like, hey, I don't want to, like, I don't want to bother.
[72:05.40]He's probably so busy.
[72:06.94]Oh, my God.
[72:07.31]He's probably so busy.
[72:08.39]Oh, he's, like, the streamer.
[72:09.91]No, I'm probably literally, like, going and buying, like, socks.
[72:13.07]Like, I'm not doing anything important.
[72:16.25]If you were to, like, wave me down and be like, hey, are you?
[72:18.69]I'd be like, yeah.
[72:19.37]I'd probably talk to you for a little bit.
[72:21.78]Wouldn't be like it.
[72:24.50]That doesn't bother me, though.
[72:25.44]So, if you ever do see me out in public, you know.
[72:30.65]I don't care.
[72:31.01]As long as you're not, like, fucking weird.
[72:35.01]If you're not weird about it, I don't care.
[72:38.17]Don't be weird about it.
[72:40.75]You know what I mean?
[72:50.09]Yeah, let me be the weird one.
[72:52.01]Let me be the weird one.
[73:03.50]I like this nozzle better.
[73:07.32]Oh, come on.
[73:09.90]Don't be weird.
[73:11.94]But I would use that as a blanket statement for everything, though.
[73:14.60]Just don't be weird.
[73:16.30]You know what I mean?
[73:22.77]I'm really happy to, like, talk to people and hang out with people just for, like, a little while or something.
[73:27.69]But, like, just don't be weird about it.
[73:29.05]Like, I don't want to be weird to you, right?
[73:34.55]Well, I did do, like, look at me in the middle of a pet store.
[73:36.95]But, like, whatever.
[73:37.67]Like, whatever.
[73:39.61]Let me be the weird one.
[73:46.44]If other people there must have been like, what the fuck is going on?
[73:48.78]Who is this guy?
[74:10.22]If I see you in real life, can I give you bits or subs?
[74:13.90]No.
[74:17.66]Nope.
[74:19.08]No, I literally will not accept that.
[74:29.09]Real bits.
[74:30.85]No.
[74:37.93]Where's dirt?
[74:39.47]Edges?
[74:40.01]Yep.
[74:40.89]Uh-huh.
[74:45.36]What about a gift card?
[74:47.32]If you give me a gift card, I'm going to do what everybody does with gift cards.
[74:50.16]And I'm going to put it into my wallet and forget it's there for a year or two.
[74:55.57]And then by the time I want to use it, the store that you gave me the gift card to, I probably don't even have one near me anymore.
[75:07.84]Turn it off.
[75:11.00]Like, I may have, like, moved across, like, state lines at that point.
[75:14.03]And that store doesn't even... I don't have one of those near me.
[75:26.64]Okay, what's next?
[75:27.72]I got all that.
[75:28.24]That's good.
[75:30.62]32% clean.
[75:31.42]What else is left?
[75:32.78]Oh, shit.
[75:33.14]All this stuff.
[75:41.26]What the fuck?
[75:41.96]I just cleaned this.
[75:48.92]What?
[75:55.27]Let's go.
[76:02.13]Let's go thinner.
[76:03.53]Yeah.
[76:05.05]No.
[76:05.49]Yeah.
[76:12.99]Oh, sunflowers!
[76:15.54]I have those.
[76:29.03]Congrats!
[76:32.03]Yeah, that was my way for you to be like, sunflowers?
[76:36.25]What do you mean sunflowers?
[76:37.83]Do you remember sunflowers?
[76:38.91]And then I get to tell you about all my gardening?
[76:41.31]I'm annoying.
[76:42.53]I'm really annoying.
[76:55.86]Look, I'll just tell you about it and then you can just look at your phone and say every last word of every sentence that I say, okay?
[77:16.05]Would you, should you not do this to upholstery?
[77:18.75]I feel like you don't do this to upholstery.
[77:28.44]So I have some flowers.
[77:30.60]And I've got four in a big pot.
[77:36.40]And they are just barely going into adulthood.
[77:42.50]And I'm really into it.
[77:44.48]I think it's a really cool thing.
[77:46.16]They're very big.
[77:46.95]They're going to be probably six feet tall.
[77:55.15]Yep.
[77:55.47]Yep.
[77:56.73]You're paying attention.
[77:57.77]I know you are.
[77:58.83]Otherwise, how would you know the last word that I just said?
[78:03.70]I don't know.
[78:04.02]I forget the exact name.
[78:05.07]I think they're... I don't want to say the wrong name.
[78:10.13]But they're going to be really tall.
[78:12.23]I go out there every day.
[78:13.73]You're like on your phone.
[78:21.52]Someone's telling you a story.
[78:22.44]You just type it away.
[78:23.18]It was really cool when they came over.
[78:27.14]It's like, what the fuck, dude?
[78:38.53]Give me the big one.
[78:41.73]Oh, this is fucking filthy.
[78:45.29]Do I have any other flowers?
[78:46.27]Oh, I have a... I have a money tree.
[78:51.43]That does not stay outside, though.
[78:54.68]Money tree is inside.
[78:56.28]Okay.
[79:02.54]Money tree.
[79:02.98]Okay.
[79:04.77]They're really cute.
[79:05.51]It's a little one.
[79:06.35]It's one of those small braided ones.
[79:09.85]I have a few succulents that sit in a little container.
[79:16.98]And then I have... I don't know.
[79:17.84]It's a little polka dot plant.
[79:20.26]I forget what it's called.
[79:21.84]It's small.
[79:22.87]It's maybe about as big as a baseball.
[79:25.05]It has green, pink polka dot leaves.
[79:29.59]It's almost like the channel colors.
[79:31.27]It's really cool.
[79:34.81]And I take good care of them, and I love them very much.
[79:46.76]Ugh.
[79:47.96]Gross.
[79:56.67]Is it poison ivy?
[79:57.63]No.
[79:59.15]It's like a little desert plant.
[80:13.70]Jesus, he's still playing video games.
[80:16.80]What, did you expect me not to be playing games anymore?
[80:22.12]I still play games.
[80:22.82]Like, occasionally, right?
[80:31.02]I play games like this because this is sick.
[80:38.01]Turns out they're literally called what?
[80:39.51]I missed it.
[80:39.89]I need to get up there.
[80:44.63]Let's do the car.
[80:48.91]Play Backgammon next?
[80:50.73]I don't know how to play Backgammon.
[80:58.74]Backgammon was always a game that somebody had in their house as a display.
[81:02.20]They never took it out of the box.
[81:12.22]Ooh, that looks nice, actually.
[81:18.40]Got it.
[81:22.05]Play Blackjack in Fallout New Vegas.
[81:28.73]Yeah, that one.
[81:33.23]It's the car from the carnival.
[81:34.29]It kind of does look like that.
[81:35.17]Give me the red one.
[81:43.08]This one's better.
[81:46.58]Gambling stream when?
[81:50.73]Isn't gambling, isn't like gambling on Twitch now?
[81:59.50]Yes.
[82:01.60]Slots.
[82:02.40]Slots.
[82:03.51]You know, I really didn't, I thought, I never thought that slots were going to be a thing.
[82:10.51]I always knew that like, yeah, you could do it, but I never thought it would be.
[82:12.93]Honestly, I'll take, I'll take the loss on that one.
[82:15.14]I thought it was going to be Battleship.
[82:21.26]Honestly, I thought I would have been Twister before it would have been Slots.
[82:28.80]We just went right to Slots, huh?
[82:30.04]Twister is... Oh, by the way, I forgot to say this.
[82:44.23]I watched the entire movie of Son of the Mask last night.
[82:47.80]I don't know why.
[82:50.61]Do you know why?
[82:51.11]This is weird to say.
[82:54.25]I don't, I, I, the movie sucked, okay?
[82:57.11]But listen, I wanted to watch all, like, the really shitty scenes in a row, but I didn't want to open up, like, ten YouTube tabs to watch just the scenes of the movie that I wanted to watch, so I just rented it. ...
[83:18.99]And I just did the thing I was going to do anyways.
[83:24.38]The best part of that whole movie is the part where he goes, You're just too good to be true.
[83:27.98]Can't take my eyes off of you.
[83:29.00]You're just too good to be true.
[83:30.68]It's so bad.
[83:31.72]I hate it, but I watch it all the time.
[83:32.92]You're just too good to be true.
[83:35.82]Can't take my eyes off of you.
[83:36.80]You're too good to be true.
[83:37.68]I know I love you so much.
[83:49.08]Yes, I watched Son of the Mask before Megamind.
[83:57.90]By the way, there's something I didn't realize about Son of the Mask.
[84:01.71]I've never seen that whole movie start to finish, even 10, 20 years ago, whatever, when it came out.
[84:08.27]The actor with Jamie Kennedy, right?
[84:11.60]He only puts the mask on like twice in the whole fucking movie.
[84:15.96]That whole movie is a cartoon baby versus the dog.
[84:22.79]He puts the mask on twice in the whole movie.
[84:24.73]He puts it on the very beginning, and then at the very end.
[84:27.85]He doesn't ever put the mask on.
[84:29.37]It's like, what the hell?
[84:31.17]The dog has the mask on in the movie more than he does.
[84:33.62]What do you mean spoilers?
[84:35.32]Nobody cares.
[84:51.99]Stop spoiling, son of the mask.
[84:56.25]I didn't tell you the plot of the movie, I just told you that the... Alright, so... Jim Carrey was the mask, right?
[85:05.36]And... Oh my god, it's one of the best movies ever made.
[85:10.81]Right?
[85:11.05]And we all can agree on that.
[85:12.07]That's a simple fact, right?
[85:15.24]I still just have to, I don't know why they made another one without having Jim Carrey be the mask.
[85:19.86]Like, well, why would you even do it?
[85:21.18]It doesn't make any sense.
[85:21.99]Get it.
[85:38.60]This is almost done.
[85:40.86]This looks clean.
[85:45.14]Movie is a really awful adaptation of the comic.
[85:47.46]Yeah, I've heard of that.
[85:48.86]The original comic is kind of, like, dark and awful, right?
[85:51.99]Alright, looking good.
[86:08.59]It's just, I have to get 100%.
[86:10.67]I can't not get it.
[86:11.33]This is going to give me a ton of money, too.
[86:18.71]It's better to just do this.
[86:25.28]Does the comic have Jim Carrey in it?
[86:26.86]Wait, what?
[86:29.62]What are you talking about?
[86:33.00]No?
[86:35.96]It was for money.
[86:39.20]I guess, but... The only reason why it made any money is because Jim Carrey was the mask.
[86:49.92]How am I going to get in this crevice?
[87:00.97]God damn it.
[87:01.43]I need 100%.
[87:01.67]There's stuff in the crevice.
[87:09.51]What about Sonic the Hedgehog?
[87:13.41]I thought he was good in Sonic the Hedgehog.
[87:14.75]I saw it.
[87:20.07]This is another thing, like, look, Jim Carrey, Jim Carrey is, Jim Carrey's old now.
[87:24.69]He's, like, older.
[87:25.43]I wouldn't say he's, like, an old man, but he's, he's, like, 60 or something.
[87:41.63]Now, the stuff that he was doing in his late 20s, early 30s, like Ace Ventura and stuff, I mean, he's, he can, he's still got it.
[87:48.50]I think he's still got it.
[87:59.44]90s Jim Carrey is peak.
[88:00.38]I'll tell you, and I mean this very, very much so.
[88:04.18]If there's no Jim Carrey, there's no Jerma.
[88:11.69]I'm serious.
[88:16.59]I don't do any of this stuff unless I thought he was really funny.
[88:19.59]I'm telling you.
[88:28.49]Give me the big, the big, yeah, that one.
[88:35.38]Gross, are we gonna clean up the grease?
[88:38.04]You're a Walmart Jim Carrey.
[88:40.54]Oh, that's fine.
[88:41.60]I will never, I will never be Jim Carrey.
[88:46.86]That's fine, yeah, I don't care.
[88:50.53]In fact, don't even, don't even use my name.
[88:53.62]In the same sentence as Jim Carrey.
[88:55.76]Like, oh, you're a this Jim... No, no, no.
[88:57.74]Don't even say that.
[88:59.20]Remove me from Jim Carrey.
[89:10.95]That's not enough of grease?
[89:13.33]Shit.
[89:13.87]I can only get it off with this one.
[89:27.34]It feels so good.
[89:28.66]I love this game.
[89:31.58]I know.
[89:31.96]I don't care if I keep saying it.
[89:40.44]Jim Carrey would be proud of you as their son.
[89:45.00]Alright, now we're getting weird.
[89:48.32]Now this is getting weird.
[90:00.94]It is now it's getting weird.
[90:02.58]What?
[90:03.04]What did I say before that made it weird?
[90:04.19]I'm gonna watch it again tonight.
[90:34.89]FAD?
[90:37.21]Watch that scene on stream.
[90:38.39]I can't.
[90:39.99]DMCA exists, guys.
[90:41.46]I can't do that.
[90:41.96]What did you say?
[90:51.78]Am I gonna what?
[90:52.10]What did that person say?
[90:53.66]Am I gonna what?
[90:56.33]Are you gonna go on schooled?
[90:59.09]Um, what do you mean?
[91:00.85]Schooled.
[91:08.89]Joe Biden is the son of the mask?
[91:19.92]Mizkif's show.
[91:22.08]Oh.
[91:22.68]Oh, okay.
[91:26.52]Did I?
[91:27.78]Does he want me to do it?
[91:29.14]Are you guys just saying this?
[91:40.83]Hold on, is this one of those things where, like, you get the streamer to say the other streamer's name, so then the other streamer then has to say and, like, react to me because I said the streamer's name?
[91:50.30]Is that what we're doing, or did he actually say this?
[92:01.28]Ego Andy.
[92:02.30]I didn't say... What are you talking about?
[92:05.37]What about a banana?
[92:05.97]What about a banana?
[92:17.98]He said he hates you.
[92:18.88]No, he didn't.
[92:27.47]I know that for a fact.
[92:33.81]I just watched that scene from Son of the Mask and it sucks.
[92:36.89]I know.
[92:37.99]So why don't you watch the whole movie to just... Here's the thing, I don't even hate watch stuff.
[92:43.77]That would be classified as hate watching, right?
[92:48.38]I don't even hate watch it.
[92:49.90]I'm like happy that I'm there experiencing it.
[92:54.16]I don't know.
[92:54.72]It's weird.
[92:55.22]It's not hate watching.
[92:56.40]Because I don't hate it.
[93:00.08]I'm just so intrigued by it.
[93:02.12]Does that make sense?
[93:02.76]That looks good, right?
[93:15.00]Oh, nope.
[93:18.96]Whoa, what the fuck?
[93:23.14]You can prone like Cod?
[93:28.20]Well, I'll say the same thing I say every time about like collabing with other people.
[93:33.18]As you all know, I do collabs when I think they make sense or if there's a thing I think would be fun.
[93:42.32]I do things with other people sometimes.
[93:44.92]The most part is just me.
[93:47.26]I don't know.
[93:47.60]I'm not against doing anything with anybody.
[93:49.74]It just... I usually do things alone.
[93:53.61]We've talked about other streamers before.
[93:57.55]If it sounds like something fun.
[93:58.48]Sounds like something I'd want to do.
[93:59.60]I'll do it.
[94:01.32]That's it.
[94:02.22]There's no other motive or anything.
[94:20.91]Mr. Incredible, what?
[94:27.64]What happened to the card game?
[94:31.04]Are you talking about Grotto Beasts?
[94:33.18]The card?
[94:33.66]The real card packs?
[94:36.16]The real cards you'll be able to open?
[94:38.28]Very soon?
[94:38.83]Is that what you're referring to?
[94:40.19]You're talking about the Grotto Beasts cards?
[94:42.57]That you'll be able to buy?
[94:43.79]And have in real life?
[94:46.05]Soon?
[94:46.41]Is that what you're referring to?
[94:56.63]I mean, that's not... It's not ready yet, but it will be very soon.
[95:04.28]It'll be soon.
[95:16.75]He always says soon.
[95:18.35]Yeah, soon could mean whenever.
[95:20.93]Soon is soon.
[95:21.73]Soon is when you get it.
[95:24.51]Soon, okay, here, listen.
[95:26.29]Soon means real.
[95:29.09]That's all you need to know.
[95:30.31]Soon means it's real.
[95:31.71]Alright, that's good.
[95:43.36]That one's done.
[95:44.48]Wait.
[95:47.24]This backyard's done.
[95:48.18]It looked like a pretty good backyard.
[95:53.95]What if there's a bird in here?
[96:13.28]Your cousin from Boston.
[96:17.66]God damn it.
[96:19.62]I don't want to hurt the bird in here.
[96:20.70]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:25.57]Okay, everybody get ready.
[96:27.33]It's time.
[96:28.59]Shoot the target in front of you and ready, go.
[96:32.57]Fuck!
[96:33.55]Now I lost.
[96:34.29]God damn it.
[96:36.02]That kid next to me did it perfectly fine.
[96:40.82]I'm just, don't, just let go.
[96:41.72]Why even do it anymore?
[96:42.60]I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna get to the end.
[96:46.48]Why even, why even continue if you didn't get it the first time?
[96:56.70]It probably should have been mine.
[96:57.56]The term is bad in amusement park games.
[97:11.04]No, that happens every time.
[97:12.54]If you are doing that game, and there's ten of you there, and you're ready, you're lining it up, and it's like, and start!
[97:19.66]It's over.
[97:19.96]You've lost.
[97:20.86]It's over.
[97:22.16]You've lost.
[97:22.80]If you end up, like we all do, there's one person that gets it right, and they win.
[97:37.25]Gosh, maybe I should spell something.
[97:55.29]What the fuck?
[97:56.77]What the fuck?
[97:57.95]Are you kidding me?
[98:01.77]Who wrote this?
[98:03.63]Who wrote that?
[98:05.01]What the heck are you doing?
[98:06.49]Oh my god.
[98:07.39]It's so funny.
[98:12.78]Wait, I don't want to do that last.
[98:13.72]Aaron!
[98:19.54]Is this done?
[98:20.46]What?
[98:25.28]How am I supposed to get in there?
[98:48.34]Underneath oh shit
[99:04.59]Stop hurting the bird.
[99:17.21]Ms.
[99:17.45]Gif, I'll do it!
[99:18.43]I don't even know what I just agreed to.
[99:34.87]I want to be like, oh yeah, what's gonna happen is uh... Oh no, what do you mean oh no?
[99:41.46]I'm not invited.
[99:42.32]Did you guys just gaslight me?
[99:48.00]Oh no, now I look like a fucking idiot.
[100:04.11]Like, accepting an invitation I was never invited to.
[100:08.45]Oh, man.
[100:09.09]Alright, how do I fix this?
[100:11.63]I gotta fix this.
[100:12.45]What do I do?
[100:13.69]You just self-invited?
[100:14.81]Did I?
[100:16.29]Was everybody saying that?
[100:24.87]Just go offline, bro.
[100:26.15]Oh, I gotta go.
[100:26.85]I'm out.
[100:27.51]I'm out of here.
[100:36.87]Wait, I want to do the furniture first.
[100:39.96]Just agreeing to something that A, I was probably never invited to.
[100:44.24]And B, I don't even really know what it is.
[100:46.08]Ooh, I like the umbrella.
[101:11.45]Little bro, apologize.
[101:20.16]Your ego is showing.
[101:21.62]Is it?
[101:21.90]I didn't do anything.
[101:22.88]What did I do?
[101:23.78]Did I do something?
[101:25.84]Is being like a 20k Andy like fucking up my brain?
[101:28.83]I don't know.
[101:29.71]Is it?
[101:30.91]What do I do?
[101:51.88]White noise.
[101:55.68]Mizkip just said yes.
[101:57.14]Next week.
[101:59.12]Next week?
[102:00.31]What do I have to do?
[102:01.03]I have to travel or something?
[102:03.89]What do we do?
[102:04.27]Alright, stop.
[102:12.49]Stop lying.
[102:13.13]Are they lying?
[102:14.17]I just got pity invited.
[102:17.67]No, don't say that.
[102:21.36]Alright, I'm gonna stop addressing it, and if it's real, then I'll figure it out.
[102:25.04]If it's not real, then it was fun.
[102:26.62]And I'm sure it's a fucking awesome show.
[102:28.36]I really think it's probably really fun.
[102:36.46]You're old enough to be their grandpa.
[102:49.09]Am I?
[102:49.55]How old am I?
[102:53.36]They're saying you have to come in as the sus guy.
[102:55.32]They want the sus guy?
[103:03.24]No, they don't.
[103:03.96]That would be hilarious if they actually did, though.
[103:12.67]He said hello?
[103:13.43]Well, I say hello back.
[103:21.43]Why is this like... Okay.
[103:23.37]Oh, can you tell... Can you tell them that I said hi and I think they're cool?
[103:28.61]You just go tell them.
[103:29.67]I don't want to be your messenger.
[103:31.33]No, you do it, right?
[103:33.78]I'm saying it.
[103:35.68]Hey, what's up, Mizkith?
[103:36.22]How you doing?
[103:37.60]Hope things are going well.
[103:42.96]He's not even alive.
[103:45.82]Oh.
[103:56.59]I'm being gaslit.
[103:57.21]Yeah, I'm being gaslit.
[103:58.25]Alright, this is... Whatever.
[103:59.87]Let's move on from this.
[104:01.07]We're gonna move on.
[104:02.21]I'm looking forward to... I don't even... Alright, cool.
[104:06.55]This might be fun.
[104:07.47]I don't know.
[104:07.95]I don't even know what it is.
[104:09.20]Sure, let's do it.
[104:10.32]What is it?
[104:10.78]I don't know.
[104:11.72]That sounds good.
[104:24.05]You're a sussy baka.
[104:31.83]It's like... Hold on, let me read this.
[104:34.38]It's like... You seemed pretty hyped that you said, yes, he's pogging.
[104:40.74]Oh, alright.
[104:41.86]That's, yeah, cool.
[104:42.62]What are you doing?
[104:43.24]I'm power washing.
[104:46.28]Don't waste a weekly stream.
[104:47.52]Ah, no, I would be on top of what I was doing.
[104:49.58]It wouldn't be, I wouldn't replace anything.
[104:53.46]A quiz show on school questions.
[104:56.55]Oh.
[104:56.67]Oh.
[105:14.50]They said it would take you 10 minutes.
[105:15.78]Are you smarter than a Twitch streamer?
[105:17.56]LOL.
[105:20.28]Okay.
[105:21.26]Is it actually like that?
[105:22.08]Because what if I get every single question wrong?
[105:23.69]Am I going to look bad?
[105:32.95]Oh, shit.
[105:33.47]I got to like study or something.
[105:35.28]When is this happening?
[105:38.42]I got to figure it out.
[105:38.96]I got to make sure I can even do this.
[105:40.54]I might have to do it the next time they do it.
[105:43.77]If it's real.
[105:45.21]It's today.
[105:45.67]It's not today.
[105:52.20]It's every Monday?
[105:53.56]Alright.
[105:54.18]Let's... Hold on.
[105:55.12]Alright.
[105:55.74]I'll figure this out.
[105:57.48]You're late.
[105:58.06]Hurry.
[105:58.38]Oh, shit.
[105:59.78]I gotta get over there.
[106:04.08]What's my first question?
[106:06.81]What genus is the canine family from?
[106:09.73]Arachnophobia.
[106:10.67]Arachnophobia.
[106:12.60]Kick him off the fucking stream.
[106:13.64]I'm gone.
[106:25.97]How's that look?
[106:26.83]Awful.
[106:34.17]Did I hear about the new House Flipper DLC?
[106:35.68]Uh, yeah.
[106:40.68]We play every House Flipper DLC, doesn't matter how long or short it is.
[106:44.81]You'll see it on this channel.
[106:56.66]Don't cheat.
[106:57.44]Why would I- I'm not gonna- What do you mean cheat?
[107:08.34]No, I got nothing to hide.
[107:09.44]Like, really.
[107:09.94]Like, if everyone thinks I'm stupid, whatever.
[107:12.60]If I can't answer, like, a fourth grade, whatever.
[107:15.97]If I can't answer that question, then I can't.
[107:17.51]And that's the way it is.
[107:22.67]Oh, no.
[107:23.29]I'm regressing into a fourth grader.
[107:24.97]I'm method acting.
[107:25.89]I'm getting ready.
[107:40.85]This thing, I need an upgrade.
[107:41.99]Bad.
[107:42.25]100% he'll have you on.
[107:51.24]Alright, well we'll figure it out.
[107:52.16]Maybe if it's not this time, then I don't want to just fucking just jump in and be like, Oh, you said yes?
[107:57.76]Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
[107:58.74]Like, no.
[107:59.38]If they got plans, they got plans.
[108:00.56]I'll do it one of the other times or something.
[108:01.90]I don't know.
[108:02.44]We'll figure it out.
[108:04.69]I make, I have no plans, guys, when I do anything with anybody.
[108:26.27]You come over and have lunch with me sometime.
[108:28.93]Um, no.
[108:30.21]I will not.
[108:31.93]I'm sorry, but I don't do that.
[108:42.49]I can help you pick out what you'll eat for lunch today.
[108:44.89]How about, um... How about a turkey club?
[108:52.43]That sounds kind of good.
[108:53.17]Doesn't it?
[109:07.06]Somebody said, is this a mini game?
[109:08.61]What's the actual game?
[109:10.41]Yeah, this is a mini game.
[109:12.63]This is like a new shooter that came out.
[109:16.10]This is like a side game where you can actually just go power wash stuff.
[109:22.04]It's like a backyard, like, water battle game.
[109:28.09]You get the different nozzles.
[109:29.01]This is like a shotgun.
[109:30.53]And it's just like you spray each other with water, like Super Soakers.
[109:33.89]But it is a second game that lets you kind of use all the available stuff to use in the actual game.
[109:39.44]You can come and just power wash.
[109:40.38]It's really cool.
[109:41.02]I'm really into it.
[109:46.02]The game's called Soaker Sloshers.
[109:48.44]But this is like a power wash thing that they have in it, which is kind of cool.
[110:12.16]It's called Splatoon and it's real.
[110:16.20]No.
[110:17.54]The game is called Soaker Sloshers.
[110:21.12]And I'm playing the mini game.
[110:23.79]I'm playing the mini game of Soaker Sloshers.
[110:27.97]You know?
[110:43.22]How's the trim here?
[110:44.92]I'm almost done.
[110:45.50]Look at this.
[110:46.07]All I have is just this really dirty, muddy thing.
[110:47.89]A little bit more of the patio.
[110:53.25]New job.
[110:56.11]Available.
[110:56.53]This is like when your parents see you playing GTA and you pretend it's a different game.
[111:04.36]What do you mean?
[111:07.88]Like you're in... You're playing the golf or something?
[111:13.46]In GTA and you just say you're playing a golf game?
[111:27.67]You gonna do more DOS?
[111:28.91]Probably eventually.
[111:32.29]Just not now.
[111:36.69]There's always time for DOS.
[111:39.03]Those games are never going away.
[111:45.16]This umbrella is filthy.
[111:54.24]You just pretend GTA is a race game.
[111:56.19]Racing game.
[112:01.07]Yeah, but then you have to play really well.
[112:05.03]Oh, no.
[112:05.33]Yeah.
[112:05.45]What are you playing in here?
[112:06.47]Oh, it's just a racing game.
[112:09.53]Oh.
[112:10.01]And then you don't realize like you're watching and you just ran over like three people and like crashed.
[112:16.37]Oh, really?
[112:17.41]There's people you can... You hit someone.
[112:20.95]Oh, um, oops.
[112:27.28]How do you explain that one away?
[112:30.20]You can't.
[112:42.27]I don't even want to just go here and just smell this water.
[112:45.94]I want... Okay, so I want to be standing here.
[112:47.98]I want to be standing right here.
[112:51.61]I want someone to go like this.
[112:53.83]Bounce it.
[112:54.85]So this vapor goes right into my face.
[112:57.03]And I can just sit there and just... So dirty under here.
[113:23.26]Savory... No, it's a... It's just water vapor that I just like to be near.
[113:41.55]Oh, I don't vape.
[113:42.31]I find it disgusting.
[113:50.22]Don't do that shit, okay?
[113:51.36]Like, this is a public service announcement.
[113:55.08]Don't... Cut that out.
[113:57.42]Cut that out.
[113:58.04]Cut it out.
[114:03.52]Shut up, Dad.
[114:03.98]No!
[114:04.26]Cut it out!
[114:04.99]Cut that shit out.
[114:06.61]Cut it out.
[114:14.43]If you're thinking about quitting, if you're thinking about... Make this be the time you do it.
[114:22.49]Make this be it.
[114:26.19]That's it.
[114:26.91]That's just it.
[114:27.37]That's it.
[114:35.95]What a shitty PSA.
[114:37.19]Hey, Jerma985 here.
[114:40.58]Just want to say, if you vape, just cut it out.
[114:43.28]Cut that shit out.
[114:43.92]Stop doing that.
[114:45.68]Alright.
[114:49.34]Done.
[114:55.76]Don't do that anymore.
[115:09.51]I need a wider nozzle.
[115:16.36]Is this a... Let's see.
[115:17.62]Yeah, this is getting it.
[115:33.55]Damn it.
[115:34.05]I screwed it up.
[115:48.30]What if I power washed a real patio?
[115:51.68]Would you guys watch it?
[116:00.45]Would you?
[116:04.84]If I just tried to find somebody that had a really dirty backyard and dirty house, I just did it for free.
[116:12.25]I'd be like, hey, can I just power wash your whole entire yard and clean up your whole house?
[116:19.47]You just have to let me film in your house or on your property.
[116:23.37]I don't need anything else.
[116:24.23]I don't care about anything else.
[116:26.91]You think people would do that?
[116:30.83]And I would sign a death waiver too, you know what I mean?
[116:32.38]So don't worry about that.
[116:33.16]It'd be like, oh, what about that?
[116:34.10]I would sign like a death waiver.
[116:34.92]I guess I got fucking piano fell on me or something.
[116:38.63]Don't worry.
[117:02.29]Almost done.
[117:03.55]Just a little bit more of that and then just this really muddy, dirty area here.
[117:15.17]I think I would be pretty good at that.
[117:17.65]I really think I would do a pretty good job.
[117:33.38]Eat the BTS meal.
[117:36.86]What's the BTS meal?
[117:38.14]What it puts in it?
[117:49.67]McNuggets?
[117:54.45]The 10-piece nugget with sauce.
[117:55.87]That sounds fucking great.
[117:57.39]I love the nuggets.
[117:59.39]I'm a huge McNugget guy, so that meal, I would eat that.
[118:12.39]I do have a question though so a lot of people have meals at McDonald's right it's like oh this meal this like um these musicians or this these actors or is it gonna get we're gonna get to a point where just the regular McDonald's meal is just like celebrities instead of ordering like a big mac you order like the they're kind of like you know like the Larry David sandwich
[118:43.46]Like, oh, you're just on the board.
[118:44.38]It's like, it's Larry David.
[118:45.80]It's not like a, uh, like a whitefish sandwich.
[118:48.96]It's the Larry David.
[118:57.35]I do love nuggets, though.
[118:59.13]What's the sauce?
[118:59.81]What's, what's the difference?
[119:05.47]What's the, what do you get for ordering that?
[119:11.56]It's like some Cajun sauce.
[119:13.06]Wait, was that, did they have, really?
[119:23.25]It's like a chili sauce.
[119:25.29]Cajun sauce.
[119:25.97]Holy shit, that sounds really good.
[119:27.16]Is that a new sauce?
[119:37.84]Alright, I kind of want that.
[119:42.83]It's a new sauce.
[119:43.83]Oh, shit.
[119:44.41]Okay.
[120:05.26]Eat it live on stream.
[120:06.40]No, I'm just gonna enjoy it on my own time.
[120:08.66]I don't want to eat on stream.
[120:10.12]I don't want to eat on stream.
[120:22.23]No, I want to enjoy my food on my own time.
[120:26.74]Go ahead, call me a coward.
[120:30.50]That's fine.
[120:30.84]I don't want to eat on camera.
[120:41.08]Do it as Catboy.
[120:48.89]I...
[120:53.36]Gonna have to ask Catboy.
[121:05.82]It's probably gonna be no.
[121:18.41]I just don't like people looking at me eating.
[121:20.73]Or anybody else for that matter.
[121:22.08]I don't want you to look at me chewing and hearing like the... Someone's gonna make me laugh and I'm gonna go... I don't want that to happen.
[121:33.82]Like, someone's gonna make me laugh really hard and I'm gonna have french fries in my mouth and I'm gonna go... I fucking don't want that.
[121:41.33]No.
[122:25.49]I gotta get in the crevices.
[122:26.33]Where's that from?
[122:28.63]I already talked about it.
[122:32.01]I gotta get inside all these crevices like this.
[122:51.24]Fifteen million off the dead if you eat nuggets as Catboy.
[122:53.68]That's not worth it.
[122:54.36]That doesn't even- that's not gonna make a dent.
[123:14.29]Two hundred million?
[123:15.15]No.
[123:15.69]No.
[123:16.49]Nope.
[123:22.29]Guys, I don't even know where Catboy is.
[123:24.55]I don't even know.
[123:31.63]I have no idea.
[123:34.17]Half the characters that are made just fuck off and they just disappear into the woods and shit.
[123:38.77]I don't even know where they go.
[123:44.31]Some of them we see.
[124:17.98]Where did what?
[124:22.69]Who made Bugleberry?
[124:23.95]I don't know.
[124:26.81]I met Bugleberry.
[124:33.01]I found him on like Craigslist.
[124:41.26]I don't know who made Bugleberry.
[124:56.46]I hired him.
[124:58.84]Come on and read some scary stories.
[125:00.20]That's what it said he did.
[125:02.96]And.
[125:04.98]He was really, really kind of an interesting guy.
[125:08.01]So I was like, oh, I kind of maybe you'll come back or something.
[125:10.11]Do some more stuff.
[125:12.13]Did like kids birthday parties and everything.
[125:14.39]There was he had a whole thing.
[125:22.32]I don't know where he's from.
[125:34.81]I am almost done, you're right.
[125:38.27]What about Chrome Face?
[125:42.18]He's got these fucking urns, dude.
[125:44.36]I don't know.
[125:45.08]I don't know what any of that stuff is.
[125:52.76]He doesn't just make characters for me.
[125:54.54]He makes them for himself and...
[126:00.47]He does summoning courses and stuff.
[126:04.24]I don't know.
[126:04.60]I don't know what his daily life is like.
[126:06.66]I just know that sometimes I bring him on to make characters.
[126:10.65]He's a really weird guy.
[126:12.21]But he's good at what he does.
[126:29.53]Alright, I'm almost ready to do the really dirty one.
[126:34.04]Wait.
[126:41.91]Why are all of his characters a version of me?
[126:43.71]Uh, well, because... I don't know, sometimes I don't feel like fucking streaming.
[127:08.75]And I don't know.
[127:10.81]He's been making different characters and different stuff.
[127:17.43]He has whatever he has.
[127:18.99]He makes it however he does it.
[127:20.17]I don't know.
[127:22.19]You think I watch Bugleberry streams?
[127:24.13]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[127:26.43]Those streams are horrible.
[127:27.35]I always leave when he comes on.
[127:31.11]Why do you think I've watched a Bugleberry stream?
[127:34.72]It's bizarre that you have.
[127:51.54]Yeah, if I know he's going to be on, I'll just, like, get him to go to the bathroom or something or make some food or just come back and see when he's gone.
[127:59.02]He's a smart guy.
[127:59.76]He's an interesting guy, but I just don't want to watch him stream.
[128:02.94]Oh, this is going to be horrible.
[128:17.09]Look at all these crevices.
[128:31.00]Stream one?
[128:31.62]Yeah.
[128:41.34]Why does he stream?
[128:44.69]Because, like, I've told him a long time ago that he could do stuff on camera if he wanted to.
[128:49.57]And part of me hiring him required that he was gonna be able to participate in some of the streams that I do.
[128:54.31]Or some of the broadcasting hours, right?
[129:08.83]What was the charity that Bugleberry donated to?
[129:11.74]That's actually a work in progress.
[129:13.78]I'll let you guys know exactly the exact amount.
[129:18.28]And what charity it is.
[129:34.13]No, I'm not... You'll hear about that soon.
[129:57.09]You're going to pocket it?
[129:57.99]I'm not going to pocket it.
[130:00.35]No, I'm not going to do that.
[130:01.94]I'll give you the very specifics on all that stuff.
[130:05.56]I'm not just going to be like, yay!
[130:07.26]Donated it to charity.
[130:09.10]Yep.
[130:09.60]Yeah, I did.
[130:10.44]No, I'm not going to do that.
[130:13.48]I'll give you guys exact specifics of what it is.
[130:26.06]What just happened?
[130:27.72]Why did it clean it for me?
[130:28.78]I had like a whole section left.
[130:30.30]What did it do that for?
[130:32.42]Wait, what?
[130:45.63]Free cleaning.
[130:46.31]Yeah, that would have been cool.
[130:55.93]What's on this roof that's so...
[131:04.24]Where is it?
[131:11.97]Doghouse roof.
[131:12.77]Where?
[131:13.07]Oh, goddammit.
[131:27.41]Come on.
[131:36.65]Ah, thank God.
[131:39.99]Did I get the rest of the doghouse?
[131:45.09]I think I did, yeah.
[131:50.45]Use eagle vision.
[131:52.09]I keep forgetting I have that.
[132:01.74]No, don't spray that.
[132:02.46]Stop.
[132:03.40]Somebody said, I hate this game.
[132:04.92]Why?
[132:05.18]This is awesome.
[132:10.09]This is super relaxing.
[132:24.45]We hate games now?
[132:29.32]Well, you're probably going to hate them even more when the Ubisoft conference happens.
[132:33.72]That was uncalled for.
[132:34.56]Uncalled for.
[132:35.76]Why did it do that?
[132:43.52]That was uncalled for.
[132:44.32]That was uncalled for.
[132:45.71]Why did I say that?
[132:47.11]I think it's because I hated Watch Dogs Legion so much that I just had to say that.
[132:56.53]He hates Ubisoft?
[132:57.41]Yes, I do.
[132:59.24]Do you want me to, should I just pretend like I don't?
[133:00.88]I do.
[133:03.32]But that's like, that's a very strong way to word it.
[133:07.76]I don't hate Ubisoft.
[133:10.62]I just hate all their games.
[133:13.05]No, let me try that again.
[133:14.65]I don't, I just don't really like their games, okay?
[133:31.11]I've had fun with some of their games.
[133:34.37]Some of them.
[133:36.42]But for the most part, when an Ubisoft title comes out, I just go, no, I don't care.
[133:43.10]It doesn't do it for me.
[133:48.42]Hate is too strong of a word, though.
[133:50.48]Because I really don't.
[134:06.19]Alright, I want to get right to the middle.
[134:12.77]Feels good.
[134:13.19]Alright.
[134:13.95]Wait, I forgot these.
[134:16.63]This will take 10 minutes.
[134:20.69]Yeah, but I'm being thorough.
[134:23.57]I'm being very thorough.
[134:24.83]I don't just want to... I just yawned.
[134:32.11]I tried to hide it.
[134:34.63]I think that's from the headache, though.
[134:37.83]That's not because I'm tired or I'm bored.
[134:39.55]That's from the headache.
[134:41.19]You know when you get like a really yawny headache?
[134:44.01]That's what it is.
[134:55.88]I swear to God I'm not bored.
[134:57.02]I love this so much.
[134:59.28]I just have a little migraine.
[135:03.82]It's starting to evolve into a big migraine.
[135:06.27]Which is annoying.
[135:08.53]But, I'm fine.
[135:09.07]Don't worry about me, I'll be good.
[135:18.52]Too much CBD?
[135:20.18]I have not taken any CBD today.
[135:22.74]Or yesterday, or the day before, or the day before, or the day before.
[135:24.84]Oh, Jesus.
[135:51.89]Bong water?
[135:57.98]I don't... I don't smoke out of a bong.
[136:00.34]I don't smoke weed.
[136:05.34]I don't smoke weed.
[136:06.08]I don't.
[136:09.70]I got four stars already.
[136:10.88]Damn, this is dirty.
[136:25.32]It's one dollar for the car seat?
[136:26.54]Are you kidding me?
[136:35.05]So many cracks!
[137:03.00]Hit the majority and it'll auto complete.
[137:13.12]Oh, still dirty.
[137:18.36]No, spin it.
[137:28.08]It does do that, doesn't it?
[137:31.04]It does, doesn't it?
[137:33.73]Okay, cool.
[137:35.75]Final thing is... Oh, the shed.
[137:41.79]Drink lots of water.
[137:42.58]Yeah, I got water right here.
[137:51.36]Somebody said, have I ever unironically, not joking, smoked crack?
[137:57.54]No.
[137:57.70]No.
[138:00.89]I have not unironically smoked... How do you... How do you ironically smoke crack?
[138:06.16]What are you talking about?
[138:06.94]Have you ever unironically smoked crack?
[138:26.47]Alright, shed door.
[138:33.57]Shed roof.
[138:41.28]How did I not get that?
[138:46.02]If you ever smoked crack, I would unsub.
[138:49.72]Don't worry about it.
[138:50.54]I'm not going to smoke crack.
[138:51.80]Dude, what are you talking about?
[138:53.75]Don't worry about that.
[139:01.94]Why would I ever tell you I smoked crack?
[139:06.38]That's not something that I would just start with one day.
[139:08.72]Hey, what's up, guys?
[139:10.58]Yeah, I'm starting a stream.
[139:11.40]I'm going to be playing Fable 3 today.
[139:13.86]I smoked crack today.
[139:15.64]Unironically, like I did it today.
[139:17.18]What's up?
[139:45.06]Smell crack or I will unsub.
[139:48.79]No.
[139:56.69]I can't.
[139:59.23]I can't loot.
[139:59.73]Okay, I'm going to move on.
[140:04.68]I'm done with that.
[140:05.46]Do you have any heal?
[140:08.88]I got one right here.
[140:15.31]Oh shit.
[140:42.99]Very very nice.
[140:46.57]I'll get the caked on sugar, the burnt sugar.
[140:51.09]Very good.
[140:54.19]Very good.
[140:54.65]I think this is done.
[141:00.05]It is.
[141:03.19]That's it.
[141:04.55]We just have this spot over here.
[141:07.21]Gonna go thin nozzle.
[141:21.09]The swing?
[141:21.57]I'll get it in a minute.
[141:34.91]Oh, I fucked it up.
[141:35.59]It's alright, I got it.
[141:52.85]Yes, I thought this is not a fire pit.
[141:54.53]This is a pool.
[141:55.32]This is a dirty fucking pool.
[141:56.72]I'm gonna stop swearing for an hour.
[142:23.23]It looks like chocolate.
[142:28.51]What's the max price for this one?
[142:29.75]400?
[142:29.77]500?
[142:29.83]Oh, right to the very end.
[142:55.96]Yes!
[143:02.52]Look at how much better this looks.
[143:12.88]What am I missing? 99.
[143:26.12]The grill?
[143:27.83]Oh shit, they're at the back of the grill?
[143:38.05]This thing too.
[144:09.94]How do I get up there?
[144:13.78]Oh, alright.
[144:16.24]375?
[144:27.89]What?
[144:28.13]Okay, birdhouse?
[144:37.02]What's left?
[144:49.84]Or... I don't see anything.
[145:01.91]Where is it?
[145:05.01]Checklist is in the menu?
[145:15.17]Okay, status.
[145:19.19]Okay, there's one fence post.
[145:21.72]That's it.
[145:22.02]Okay.
[145:35.79]Fence post, which one?
[145:43.51]Oh, I got it.
[145:46.87]$485!
[145:46.89]Oh, let's see.
[145:56.39]Pretty cool.
[145:57.89]Do it again.
[146:07.32]Nice.
[146:10.58]Clean the dirt bike.
[146:13.18]Should I buy something?
[146:13.80]This one would probably be quick.
[146:14.66]Alright, this is gonna be quick.
[146:29.01]I love these quick jobs.
[146:30.41]They're so much fun.
[146:33.17]It just feels so right, you know what I mean?
[146:40.82]We do one pass with the wide.
[146:43.04]We come down to the green.
[146:44.72]Pass with the green.
[146:55.38]Then we change to the yellow.
[147:03.22]This'll be quick and efficient.
[147:16.37]Alright, nice.
[147:17.41]Other side.
[147:17.73]What's wrong with the nozzle?
[147:21.17]The nozzle's like broken.
[147:33.89]And now we do detail and that's it.
[147:37.00]Tires.
[147:52.28]Get in there.
[147:54.58]Does distance matter?
[147:55.50]I think it does.
[148:01.62]Is that tire?
[148:07.79]Ooh, underneath here.
[148:13.47]Yes!
[148:14.65]Yes!
[148:40.86]Squeaky clean, come on.
[148:52.29]96%.
[148:52.39]What's left?
[148:52.83]Oh, over here.
[149:04.26]Why am I shooting over there?
[149:14.14]Okay.
[149:14.42]I think it's just the front of the bike.
[149:18.84]The engine?
[149:27.41]Yeah.
[149:36.56]Alright, 99%.
[149:37.18]Just a little bit in the guts.
[149:39.42]Is it?
[149:42.20]No?
[149:42.36]No?
[149:48.58]Where the hell is it?
[149:49.28]Find out.
[149:56.43]The exhaust, the fairings, and the brake discs, okay.
[150:07.38]Now what?
[150:15.54]Brake discs?
[150:18.08]Are those back here?
[150:18.66]Are they not clean?
[150:30.75]How are they not clean?
[150:35.30]What is a break disc?
[150:43.56]Yeah, I got it.
[150:44.56]It's those.
[150:49.76]That was quick and easy $75.
[150:51.08]Ooh.
[151:00.25]Clean the playground.
[151:04.07]Clean the bungalow.
[151:06.87]Playground.
[151:09.51]Wait.
[151:09.73]$1,250. $1,250.
[151:21.76]Long extension.
[151:22.60]Ooh, soap.
[151:30.02]Urban X U2 Turbo.
[151:37.10]Prime Vista 3000 Turbo nozzle.
[151:44.50]Improves the range.
[151:51.04]Shit!
[151:51.58]I bought the wrong soap one.
[151:52.66]Alright, go back, back, back.
[152:03.47]Alright.
[152:05.89]Cleaning liquid.
[152:06.57]I already have the multi-surface.
[152:07.63]Alright, let's go.
[152:27.42]Need to reload the soap.
[152:29.60]Alright, let's see what I got.
[152:30.46]What do I got?
[152:33.90]I have the... This nozzle.
[152:36.32]Let me check this one.
[152:38.84]Oh no, where is it?
[152:44.22]Zero degree nozzle.
[152:49.93]Did I not get the... Where is it?
[152:55.67]Where is it?
[153:05.39]Bottom left?
[153:06.37]Well, that's the soap.
[153:07.05]Didn't I buy a new nozzle?
[153:14.87]Oh, jeez.
[153:15.37]Look at this.
[153:17.07]Whoa.
[153:23.01]Holy shit.
[153:23.57]Okay, hold on.
[153:23.93]I don't want to fuck this up.
[153:25.63]What's the dirtiest thing here?
[153:47.02]Just soap the absolute hell out of this.
[153:57.07]Is this doing anything?
[153:57.93]Okay.
[154:12.16]Oh, it is.
[154:12.54]Yeah, okay.
[154:24.13]Rinse it with water.
[154:39.62]That works pretty good.
[154:47.40]Use the wood soap.
[154:54.65]Oh, stone cleaner!
[154:55.47]Is this stone?
[154:58.71]What if I'm dirty?
[155:01.09]Oh, this is all purpose.
[155:01.89]It's fine.
[155:12.68]I gotta get up here.
[155:32.97]Is the soap actually doing anything worthwhile?
[155:35.27]I ran out of soap?
[155:48.14]No, I didn't.
[155:49.92]I took it off.
[155:57.09]Soap is expensive.
[156:04.49]I mean, the universal soap will work on anything.
[156:06.13]Is that working?
[156:24.22]It is.
[156:24.44]Alright, I'll put that back on.
[156:27.02]Just spray the hell out of this whole thing and then we'll rinse it.
[156:52.63]Wait, is this $15 every time it goes to zero?
[157:02.53]Is it?
[157:03.27]Let me double check.
[157:08.43]Oh, fuck that.
[157:09.03]Yeah, I'm not using this anymore.
[157:16.23]Go down the slide.
[157:18.65]Yay!
[157:35.19]Alright, now bring out the washer.
[157:37.71]And let's wash.
[157:46.28]What?
[157:46.56]8%?
[157:46.76]What?
[157:47.14]It should be higher than that.
[158:14.36]All I did was use soap?
[158:16.82]Stop pretending?
[158:17.68]What are you talking about?
[158:18.68]What?
[158:19.06]What are you talking about?
[158:32.48]What am I pretending?
[158:57.61]Not bad.
[158:58.17]Play some music?
[159:03.05]Uh, yeah.
[159:03.35]What should we put on?
[159:03.99]What do you guys want to hear?
[159:27.82]How about the one that goes... Let's see.
[159:39.73]What can I put on?
[159:43.87]Put on... No, not Doom.
[159:50.20]Something relaxing.
[159:51.98]Something we can just chill with.
[159:55.86]Supermarket Sweep.
[159:56.78]Yeah, that sounds good.
[160:06.89]Ow, my fucking head.
[160:08.05]That hurts so bad.
[160:10.64]My volume's maxed.
[160:12.68]For you guys, that was 40% softer than what I heard.
[160:17.64]Oh, my ears.
[160:24.79]Okay, well, let's go.
[160:43.21]Super market sweep!
[160:48.13]Sounds like every first Sonic level.
[160:51.00]After 2005.
[160:51.74]Something's auto-playing.
[161:08.03]I don't know what it is.
[161:09.71]Find out.
[161:13.85]There we go, it's the Supermarket Sweep main theme!
[161:19.66]Wait, didn't we already do this?
[161:21.08]Like, fucking... two, three years ago?
[161:23.66]Yeah, I remember this.
[161:36.83]We already did this.
[161:53.11]Same joke, Andy.
[161:54.21]No, it's been three years.
[161:55.01]That means we can do it again.
[162:07.17]Mario Kart.
[162:17.24]It is Mario Kart.
[162:29.48]So grimy!
[162:32.06]Super Mario Kart Shop.
[162:33.38]Super Mario Shop.
[162:34.35]I can't even fucking say your joke.
[162:36.09]It was funny when you said it, not me.
[162:58.87]Go faster.
[162:59.73]Oh, I'm try- I keep- I'm trying.
[163:01.53]I can't go faster?

[172:52.46]I can't wait.
[172:53.99]Everybody just stand up.
[172:55.45]Everybody put your hands up.
[172:56.71]And this is the American Bible Challenge.
[173:17.37]A computer wrote that song.
[173:20.54]You know what I mean?
[173:21.08]That's like algorithmically they just made that song.
[173:23.44]And I think that's Jeff Foxworthy singing it.
[173:25.66]You guys said no.
[173:26.68]I think it is.
[173:28.72]That's definitely Jeff Foxworthy singing.
[173:30.63]And this is the American Bible Challenge.
[173:33.43]The American Bible Challenge.
[173:36.55]Everybody put your hands up.
[173:38.11]It's the same person.
[173:39.53]It's Jeff Foxworthy singing it.
[173:40.63]This is the American Bible Challenge.
[173:48.74]That's him doing that.
[173:53.09]It has to be.
[173:53.81]Why would it be anybody else?
[173:56.31]There's nobody else that could be.
[173:57.73]I love that song so much.
[174:07.41]Everybody put your hands up.
[174:08.97]Everybody just stand up.
[174:10.87]Everybody put your hands up.
[174:12.45]Come on and stand up.
[174:19.90]Oh shit, I forgot to put music on.
[174:27.34]Clown car music?
[174:28.38]No.
[174:31.90]Kirby's Epic Yarn.
[174:33.94]Sure.
[174:34.92]I'll try it.
[174:37.22]Kirby's Epic Yarn.
[174:44.79]True.
[174:45.17]Okay, alright.
[174:48.95]Oh!
[174:51.67]Oh, shit!
[174:56.76]Alright.
[174:57.04]I'm getting a lot of everybody put your hands up.
[174:59.92]Everybody just stand up vibes from this.
[175:05.71]Oh, it doesn't go.
[175:06.23]It doesn't go.
[175:06.63]Alright.
[175:07.05]Yeah, that can stay on.
[175:14.37]That's fine.
[175:16.01]Drop it a little bit.
[175:16.67]It's a little loud.
[175:19.57]I'm going to drop the sounds in this game too.
[175:21.39]Because I don't want to overpower the music.
[175:34.74]Yeah, I want to be able to hear the stuff.
[175:38.33]Yeah, there we go.
[175:38.99]Turn up the water.
[175:41.95]Alright, how about the water splash sounds?
[175:49.21]Let's see.
[175:51.83]Ah, that's still, it's way louder.
[176:03.55]I think that's good.
[176:04.49]And we'll turn Kirby up.
[176:07.84]That's a good audio level.
[176:08.64]Jerma doesn't know audio.
[176:09.34]Jerma's so bad at audio.
[176:10.16]Jerma's audio fucking sucks.
[176:11.06]Jerma's audio is fucking terrible.
[176:12.06]I don't like average.
[176:12.54]If I go to Jerma straight, it sounds like shit.
[176:14.76]I'm working.
[176:15.42]I'm working on it.
[176:16.14]I'm trying.
[176:25.37]I wasn't an audio guy.
[176:26.61]I was the visual guy.
[176:30.87]Can't do everything.
[176:32.78]I can't do audio and visual.
[176:34.46]I can do visual and make the visual look alright.
[176:36.80]Is this replaying?
[176:47.72]Alright, that's good.
[176:48.16]Let's go.
[176:52.54]Everybody just stand up.
[176:54.40]Everybody put your hands up.
[176:55.38]Alright, let's clean the dinosaur.
[177:07.84]I want to soak the fuck out of this.
[177:10.50]What the hell was that?
[177:12.85]Oh, I didn't like that.
[177:13.95]Did I do that?
[177:14.75]What happened?
[177:16.17]What the fuck was that?
[177:21.98]Somebody just dropped something on the piano.
[177:24.06]Is that in the song?
[177:40.66]That's better.
[177:45.86]I didn't play this game.
[177:51.21]I didn't play any of the yarn games.
[177:52.83]They made like three of them.
[178:08.62]Gotta go more than that.
[178:12.24]Let's just go yellow.
[178:13.19]Make sure we get it all.
[178:17.91]Play them all?
[178:20.01]No, I don't think so.
[178:22.15]I mean, they're cool and everything, but no, I don't think so.
[178:37.41]You know why I don't want to play those games?
[178:40.69]Because if in the event that I don't like them, or I'm just like, eh, I don't want to sour how I feel about the way they look.
[178:50.92]Because if the game's just like, eh, if I'm not into the game, I don't want there to be a scenario where I talk a bunch of shit about it and I talk about how the game sucks.
[179:02.65]I'd rather just enjoy it from afar.
[179:07.43]Nice and clean, alright, looking good.
[179:23.78]Somebody mentioned speedrunning.
[179:27.11]I can't wait to see people speedrun this game.
[179:30.71]Right?
[179:31.87]I feel like if you want a challenge, this is, this is, this would be very hard to speedrun.
[179:48.70]Cool, ResidentSleeper.
[179:49.96]Alright, come on.
[179:59.39]My stairs look good.
[180:07.01]Doing it in one pass feels great.
[180:12.73]Oh, yuck.
[180:13.13]Alright, what's next on Kirby's Epic Yarn?
[180:26.02]Turn it up.
[180:31.49]Oh, I'm done with this one.
[180:32.73]I'm skipping ahead.
[180:33.31]Alright, okay.
[180:41.66]This is the same OST.
[180:44.52]What just happened?
[180:46.62]What happened?
[180:49.65]Where am I?
[180:50.07]What?
[181:04.13]I feel like this one's going to be quick.
[181:05.19]Alright, let's see how fast I can do this one.
[181:09.79]Start timing.
[181:12.65]10 minutes from right now and I'm done.
[181:24.60]Oh, this is pretty thick dirt.
[181:29.26]I think I need upgrades for this one.
[181:32.08]I might be able to get it.
[181:53.23]Shit, I gotta keep it in the right spot.
[181:57.59]I gotta be like a 3D printing machine, come on.
[182:14.76]I'll clean the rest of that shit up later, it's alright.
[182:40.19]Come on!
[182:41.81]It's still so dirty!
[182:54.65]What the fuck?
[183:00.75]How did I miss that much?
[183:03.65]I need a better washer?
[183:04.59]Yes I do.
[183:05.66]I'll get it after this though.
[183:22.51]Herbie's Epic Yarn?
[183:23.93]Yeah, that was requested.
[183:27.47]We do soundtrack nights, like right now.
[183:30.36]And you'll get what you want.
[183:31.78]Eventually.
[183:39.77]Got it.
[183:44.99]Alright.
[183:45.79]Oh boy, this is a lot.
[183:47.19]Alright.
[183:47.81]I need to get on the roof.
[183:53.06]Up and down or left and right?
[183:53.98]Up and down.
[183:54.34]Is this some kid shit?
[184:16.76]Okay.
[184:18.44]This is some kid shit.
[184:33.32]I hope this is relaxing.
[184:34.30]This is supposed to be a relaxing stream.
[184:39.03]While you're on the couch, just open one eye.
[184:41.57]And then you'll see, oh, where is he now?
[184:44.85]Oh, he's doing the garage door.
[184:46.04]And then just go back to bed.
[185:01.96]I'm being pretty meticulous.
[185:02.94]I'm already at 13%.
[185:03.44]This is good.
[185:04.06]What did I say?
[185:17.74]10 minutes?
[185:18.16]How long has it been? 3?
[185:31.57]And four?
[185:32.09]Okay.
[185:32.41]I'm getting there.
[185:36.07]Hey!
[185:43.02]Get out of here.
[185:54.57]Hey!
[185:55.89]Hey!
[186:07.30]Please play Super Paper Mario.
[186:09.58]Oh, you know what?
[186:11.36]You know what?
[186:12.52]That person's right.
[186:13.72]Because I'm never going to play Super Paper Mario on the stream.
[186:19.01]I'll put the Super Paper Mario OST on the stream.
[186:28.21]That's fair, right?
[186:39.35]I think that's fair.
[186:39.83]Okay.
[186:47.97]That one's good.
[186:48.69]Go over here.
[186:50.95]Yep.
[186:52.21]Watch this.
[186:52.53]Ready?
[186:58.58]See?
[187:07.10]I like this one.
[187:07.50]This one's simple.
[187:08.02]There's a big cube.
[187:23.17]Oh, that's much better.
[187:24.09]I gotta get closer, though.
[187:31.34]How much is left?
[187:46.19]Fuck.
[187:49.65]That's way too much.
[187:59.26]Like the Among Us theme song with the one that goes... Yes, that one.
[188:24.46]I just did it.
[188:25.10]I don't need to put it on.
[188:29.06]Do people still play Among Us?
[188:29.88]Or is it over yet?
[188:42.49]Is it a dead game?
[188:43.15]I don't... It's probably... I don't think it's a dead game.
[188:49.35]It's really popular still.
[189:06.90]Play Persona 5.
[189:07.74]I don't wanna- wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[189:10.94]I gotta get on the roof.
[189:19.19]Can I turn this clown music?
[189:21.89]Oh, this is Mario Party.
[189:24.15]I don't know, what game is it?
[189:28.81]Okay.
[189:34.45]I'm not gonna play Persona.
[189:35.69]That's like a 60 hour game.
[189:37.55]You're never gonna see a game on this stream that's more than 20 hours tops.
[189:42.42]I stream once a week, twice a week sometimes.
[189:47.16]It's not gonna happen.
[189:47.82]I have to be honest.
[189:49.12]I have to be real.
[190:03.97]21, almost there.
[190:14.01]Oh, what's this song?
[190:41.21]The green one, I don't have.
[190:42.39]There's no use for the green one.
[190:44.63]It's either the white or the yellow.
[190:54.18]The green one sucks.
[191:05.79]I'm going to use the soap.
[191:13.58]Oh, that's so good here.
[191:14.58]Holy shit, that's so good here.
[191:18.26]Wow.
[191:26.10]Alright, that's good.
[191:45.52]Soap the hell out of the whole house, and then I'll rinse it.
[191:47.10]Time's up.
[192:01.73]It's been 10 minutes.
[192:02.77]Oh, shit.
[192:03.29]Oh, well.
[192:19.94]Gotta go green.
[192:31.35]Stone cleaner?
[192:31.95]Oh shit, alright.
[192:36.83]Is that good?
[192:41.47]I can't tell if this is good, right?
[192:43.35]That's, I mean, kinda good.
[193:00.71]Did somebody just say Play Lisa?
[193:04.11]I swear to God, some of you guys have bots and come into this channel and just write that.
[193:09.46]There's probably at least two or three accounts that once every month just paste it.
[193:21.34]It's just set up as an algorithm.
[193:42.35]Is this stone?
[193:42.83]Turn the webcam on.
[193:51.29]No.
[193:52.61]I'm not a webcam streamer.
[193:53.77]I'm a web- No.
[193:54.53]I'm a webcam streamer with an asterisk.
[194:02.63]Only when it makes sense.
[194:03.73]It doesn't have to be on all the time.
[194:05.91]Nice.
[194:13.56]Makes sense right now.
[194:14.51]No, it doesn't.
[194:31.20]Oh, please.
[194:31.74]I would love a webcam.
[194:32.70]No.
[194:34.46]I like this song.
[194:35.14]Let's see how it goes.
[194:57.10]How can he be so mean when playing his dream game?
[194:59.32]I just don't want to put a webcam on.
[195:03.44]Stop fucking asking for it.
[195:21.45]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[195:22.95]Yeah, I know.
[195:31.47]50% of this whole place is a roof.
[195:43.50]Oh Jesus, are you kidding me?
[195:44.76]There's a ladder?
[195:59.27]Hey, Rick and Morty season four coming up.
[196:00.73]It's on the trailer.
[196:02.21]Everybody else excited?
[196:26.40]So if I- I- this is what I don't understand.
[196:28.32]If all of you hate this show, who's watching the show?
[196:32.26]You know what I'm saying?
[196:42.20]Redditors?
[196:45.37]But aren't Redditors?
[196:47.77]They- what?
[196:48.55]I don't know you- wait, so what are you guys?
[196:52.43]What are you guys?
[196:54.28]Are you Twitchers?
[196:56.53]Twitch viewers?
[197:02.59]Neckbeards.
[197:08.17]So if you guys aren't Redditors, do you guys only hang around on Twitch?
[197:17.34]I don't buy that.
[197:28.38]I don't buy that.
[197:28.96]Who's your favorite Twitch streamer?
[197:29.92]I can't even talk.
[197:30.86]Who's your favorite Twitch streamer, then?
[197:34.38]You like Twitch so much.
[197:35.14]Who's your favorite streamer?
[197:35.86]Okay.
[197:45.65]Okay.
[197:50.41]Okay.
[197:50.85]There's too much going on on this one.
[197:52.86]Yep.
[197:57.16]Ah, that's better.
[198:01.00]You're a fan of Twitch?
[198:01.82]Name every Twitch streamer.
[198:03.01]That's what I'm saying.
[198:17.07]Alright, 44%.
[198:24.84]Let's go with this guy.
[198:25.98]Let's do a quick coding.
[198:28.18]I need to get the flower.
[198:41.11]Door's gonna be done.
[198:41.71]Door's gonna be done.
[198:43.51]Okay, cool.
[198:53.62]Oh, yes.
[198:54.76]Yes!
[198:56.20]Yes!
[199:02.76]Please play the Pikachu soundtrack.
[199:10.05]Pikachu has his own soundtrack?
[199:38.87]Yes.
[199:39.86]Yes.
[199:50.35]Yes.
[199:50.61]I think it's just the roof.
[199:54.37]Down here a little.
[200:09.57]Alright, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[200:11.47]Are you still dirty?
[200:25.08]Put on near automata.
[200:26.64]Alright.
[200:30.74]Near automata.
[200:36.10]Oh, shit.
[200:36.74]Alright.
[200:37.07]This is good.
[200:42.34]Is this near?
[200:42.88]This sounds good.
[201:11.56]Oh, wait, hold on, sorry.
[201:14.40]Nier Automata.
[201:24.23]Nier Automata Full OST.
[201:37.32]Nier gets copyright strikes from YouTube.
[201:39.18]Oh, oh well.
[201:44.62]What's next?
[202:13.74]Uh, how about... It's been 20 minutes and you're still not done.
[202:19.39]Yeah, but this is flowing.
[202:22.47]Play Lisa!
[202:23.45]Play Lisa the Painful!
[202:25.19]You should play Lisa the Painful.
[202:26.35]You should play Lisa the Painful and stream it.
[202:31.33]It should be like an exclamation point Lisa that just says, I will never play Lisa the Painful.
[202:36.93]So then I can put it in when the bots put it in.
[202:48.46]Pokémon?
[202:50.60]Yeah, Pokémon battle music.
[202:52.14]That sounds good to me.
[202:54.74]Pokémon hype mix battle music.
[202:58.82]Get hyped with this compilation of some of the best battle songs from the Pokémon OST.
[203:14.44]It's pretty... I get it.
[203:16.08]Here we go.
[203:37.53]Is this in the... Okay, this is not in Pokémon.
[203:54.78]This song is not in Pokémon.
[203:57.47]This is somebody remixed it.
[204:07.21]This is that song that goes... This is a, uh... What is it?
[204:09.65]The Chemical Brothers?
[204:10.57]No, who is it?
[204:11.51]Psychosomatic, gotta get insane...
[204:40.71]That's the song.
[204:44.91]Firestarter, right?
[204:46.10]There it is.
[204:46.54]I'm a firestarter.
[204:48.30]Just a firestarter.
[204:53.82]What is the name of this song?
[204:58.45]Prodigy, yeah, alright.
[205:06.99]This is not in Pokémon.
[205:08.45]I know that for a fact.
[205:26.95]This is literally Pokémon.
[205:28.23]I don't believe you.
[205:29.03]This is from Gen 8?
[205:53.55]I don't like this.
[205:54.47]This is not... It's the only kind of Pokémon music I like.
[206:05.30]I don't like new things.
[206:06.02]I don't like new things.
[206:06.72]I like old things from 1995.
[206:35.96]This is not even in Pokémon.
[206:52.00]Oh.
[206:55.01]Where is it?
[206:55.43]Where's the one I like?
[207:06.33]Where's the one that I like?
[207:07.51]This is like the Hedgehog I like this though I just hear the blast processing sound
[207:47.35]It's gonna be too hard to get these.
[207:48.53]Alright, I can do this.
[207:49.31]Yeah, this is awesome.
[207:57.29]I really like this one a lot.
[208:07.10]This thing sucks.
[208:13.42]I need a better nozzle.
[208:17.01]I feel like I can beat this level.
[208:17.81]Alright, this is almost... Come on, it's done.
[208:44.17]Give it to me.
[208:50.00]Where'd it go?
[208:53.72]Oh, whatever.
[208:54.06]I'm going up.
[209:10.70]No, no, no.
[209:11.64]I mean, this playlist is cool.
[209:15.38]Here we go.
[209:21.02]Yep, this is it.
[209:23.82]This is exactly what I was looking for.
[209:25.04]That's not.
[209:41.50]Nope, that's not it.
[209:45.71]Not it.
[209:50.23]Is this it?
[209:54.11]No, I want the one from Brawl.
[210:02.80]What's the one from Brawl?
[210:10.78]Gen 2?
[210:11.08]Is it?
[210:16.46]I think this is it.
[210:38.24]Fake Andy.
[210:39.06]What?
[210:58.88]The Brawl soundtrack is far... The Brawl soundtrack is way better than all the other Smash Bros.
[211:03.97]soundtracks.
[211:05.87]It is equivocally the best one they've ever made.
[211:14.34]Nothing compares.
[211:15.16]It was so much better than everything else.
[211:22.80]You might think Brawl sucks, but the music in Brawl was totally better than anything else they've ever done.
[211:36.76]I fall in love.
[211:39.22]Oh, fuck that.
[211:39.76]Let's just put on the Brawl OST.
[211:41.56]Fuck that.
[211:42.90]That's the one I want to hear.
[211:49.51]You remember this one when you were wherever you were?
[211:52.49]Remember when you heard this?
[211:54.88]This is one of the best songs in the whole soundtrack.
[212:18.41]Calm down, man.
[212:22.41]I don't think I timed out for one minute.
[212:41.33]Ah, this is a perfect soundtrack for what we're doing.
[212:49.38]This is a coloring book.
[212:52.69]This is a pro tip for all you guys that have trouble with coloring books.
[212:56.13]Always fill in the edges first.
[212:58.43]So then you can't color outside the lines.
[213:02.06]Go a half inch around, so then that's your new line, so you'll never color outside the lines.
[213:21.21]You're going so slow.
[213:23.29]I'm not going slow.
[213:24.59]I mean, I am right now because I can't move that fast.
[213:33.43]For some reason on the roof.
[213:41.22]Another good one.
[214:00.55]Don't fall.
[214:01.31]I won't.
[214:01.59]I'm good.
[214:02.33]Alright, now we colored inside the lines.
[214:03.51]Now we go like this.
[214:04.99]I can probably do green for this one.
[214:09.81]You know what's funny?
[214:23.54]This would probably be the background music for this video.
[214:31.23]If I was gonna have this on YouTube and I'm like a power washing guy channel, this is probably what it would be.
[214:36.07]Do soap on the roof?
[214:53.44]Oh shit, that's good.
[215:09.72]Another classic.
[215:10.62]Another one.
[215:13.14]Every single song on the Brawl... Can I... Why do I... Whatever.
[215:18.15]Every single soundtrack on the... Oh my god.
[215:20.87]Every single... This song is speech jamming me.
[215:23.89]Every single song on the Brawl soundtrack was good.
[215:29.13]I never skipped one of them.
[215:35.96]They were all good.
[216:08.61]Alright, we're at 69%.
[216:10.67]Everybody yellow L real quick.
[216:22.82]This is like a weird Spongebob Mario mashup.
[216:49.56]Oh my fucking god, stop.
[216:51.44]No swearing.
[216:51.90]I don't know the junk that would be in there.
[217:20.50]Hit it.
[217:22.50]Oh, whatever.
[217:26.88]What am I missing on this roof?
[217:36.09]Oh, it's so dirty.
[217:38.53]Filthy over here.
[217:39.19]Is that Wario?
[217:46.63]I think it's Wario.
[218:01.46]Am I going fast enough for you now?
[218:18.72]That's a better speed, don't you think?
[218:24.36]Soap?
[218:24.82]I don't need it.
[218:29.64]I'll use soap when I get the better nozzle.
[218:32.40]I'm still using the original power washer.
[218:33.70]This thing kind of sucks.
[218:36.58]Throw it at 1,200.
[218:54.15]There's a lot of Mario songs on the Brawl track, aren't there?
[218:56.84]I didn't realize there were this many.
[219:10.25]S1.
[219:10.39]Yeah, this is really good too.
[219:11.45]74%.
[219:25.50]Come on.
[219:26.12]Come on.
[219:28.14]You know what I'm... Come on.
[219:30.14]Say it.
[219:30.38]Come on.
[219:39.28]That's when I hold the microphone out to the audience and everyone goes, When?
[219:53.10]We kind of wanted to make a fake advertisement for like a comedy DVD or comedy CD.
[219:59.63]And there's a huge audience and it's like the announcer guy, the infomercial guy is like, and such antics as.
[220:06.78]It's this little routine of little stream jokes.
[220:09.92]Like an audience.
[220:13.10]Just make a little infomercial of a fake CD that doesn't exist.
[220:20.45]Relive all those classic moments.
[220:22.65]Like, come on, Gwyn.
[220:24.79]Oh, come on, come on, Gwyn.
[220:26.30]And everybody's fucking is cackling in the audience.
[220:38.72]They also brought, like, the vault.
[220:41.53]We got access to the Jerma985 vault.
[220:45.55]After his estate got it.
[220:46.61]Yeah, like, they got access to my vault.
[221:05.28]Wait, am I supposed to be dead?
[221:15.32]Fuck, I didn't want to fall off.
[221:33.36]Clean, clean, clean.
[221:34.32]Alright, this is going to be a huge chunk, this roof.
[221:44.83]Stop it.
[221:55.31]Was it 80%?
[221:55.55]Ugh, somebody get this guy a harness.
[222:17.09]You're not safe from a fall joke even in this game.
[222:19.26]No, you're not.
[222:24.62]You're always at risk to hear a fall joke or see a fall joke, no matter what we're doing.
[222:43.90]Oh, fuck, whatever.
[222:50.75]That tree has a smile.
[222:53.61]That tree is fucking laughing at me.
[222:54.87]Right there.
[223:22.08]I didn't even do any of this.
[223:23.06]Alright, let's do this.
[223:24.11]I'll finish with the roof.
[223:28.07]What if it's like dinosaur playground place?
[223:29.67]Can I go back and do that again?
[223:31.41]Hopefully it's not reset.
[223:33.45]That would be really annoying if it was.
[223:35.99]What's this from?
[223:54.78]Mario's way cooler than Mickey Mouse.
[223:56.14]I'm sorry.
[223:59.86]If you want to have the thing that is just the universal, everybody loves it.
[224:04.36]Everyone.
[224:05.22]It's Super Mario.
[224:06.10]Like, it's not Mickey Mouse.
[224:06.92]Fuck that guy.
[224:11.17]Donald Duck is way better anyways.
[224:26.36]I can't think of anything... When you hear the word Super Mario... You don't think... All you think about is, oh, that's... I feel very happy right now.
[224:37.91]I feel at peace for just a moment.
[224:39.67]Even just a moment.
[224:44.65]When you hear Mickey Mouse, you also feel some joy for a moment.
[224:48.53]Mickey Mouse.
[224:48.97]Ooh.
[224:51.08]Mickey Mouse.
[224:53.86]Then you realize it's $4 for a water at Disney.
[224:59.63]It gets a little sour in your mouth for a second.
[225:20.18]It must be on sale.
[225:23.09]How much is a bottle of water at, like, Disneyland?
[225:25.79]Anybody know?
[225:27.09]Just like a Dasani bottle of water.
[225:28.73]Is it five bucks?
[225:39.04]Is it four bucks?
[225:44.36]Probably five bucks.
[225:45.20]Yeah, it probably is.
[225:45.76]$3.75? $3.50?
[226:01.38]Let's go to a water fountain.
[226:08.40]So, when is the copyright run out for Mickey Mouse?
[226:11.52]You guys know that that's happening, right?
[226:17.01]I wonder what they're going to do about that.
[226:23.49]Your local car dealership is going to be able to have Mickey Mouse pop up and be like, Oh, yes, I love Dave's Toyota!
[226:29.70]Or whatever it is.
[226:32.47]Can you imagine when the copyright runs out, how many fucking commercials are gonna be showing up with Mickey Mouse on them?
[226:38.12]It'll be every commercial.
[226:41.04]Every other commercial, once that copyright runs out, will have Mickey Mouse in it.
[226:47.74]He'll be in all of Garden commercials, he'll be in every local, every single local commercial you've ever seen will have him in it.
[226:54.43]It's gonna be so annoying.
[226:58.19]Mickey Mouse is gonna be endorsing so many products.
[227:17.23]Think of the oversaturation, though.
[227:20.01]If you watch an Olive Garden commercial and Mickey Mouse is there, and then your local Toyota is Mickey Mouse, and then a toothpaste commercial has Mickey Mouse in it... It's gonna be crazy for a while.
[227:46.02]2024.
[227:46.06]Yeah, when is it actually supposed to happen?
[227:48.16]They're never going to let that happen.
[227:49.35]No way.
[227:53.09]I would be really surprised if it actually did happen.
[227:54.93]2024.
[227:59.13]No way.
[227:59.59]Think of every virus website.
[228:11.48]That is a banner ad.
[228:12.52]That will just have Mickey Mouse doing the standing sideways with his arms up, with his hands pointing towards the banner.
[228:24.63]People are going to just click it because it's Mickey Mouse.
[228:35.78]It'll just say, the magic of Mickey Mouse.
[228:39.76]Come over to... I don't know, whatever it is.
[228:42.42]Whatever virus website it is.
[228:44.04]Whatever scam it is.
[228:53.31]They've already... Hold on.
[228:54.41]Let me pause this.
[228:57.13]They've already bought themselves more time.
[228:58.75]Technically, it's the Steamboat Willy Mickey.
[229:01.87]And they've kind of gotten that back by reverting to an older art style for some cartoons.
[229:08.11]Oh...
[229:14.07]Mickey Mouse.
[229:14.85]You think scammers care about copyright?
[229:18.22]Literally nobody under 40 cares about Mickey Mouse.
[229:22.52]That's not true.
[229:24.78]Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is one of the most popular things that anybody that was young, my nieces and nephews, they watched the hell out of it.
[229:31.04]What are you talking about?
[229:37.64]That was a huge deal for at least a few, a couple of years.
[229:44.02]Alright, let's- I wanna skip to... Ooh, Mother.
[229:46.52]These are good.
[229:57.43]Yeah, of course you'd- everybody would- Mickey Mouse is a big deal when you're a little kid.
[230:02.31]I could correct that statement.
[230:04.64]And say that anybody under 40...
[230:07.83]And over ten, maybe, is correct.
[230:11.60]But I think you really underestimate how powerful of a character Mickey Mouse is to young kids.
[230:18.16]Especially, like, three, two, three, four, five year olds.
[230:31.95]Yeah, hot dog!
[230:33.75]Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggity dog!
[230:37.75]Now we've got ears.
[230:38.91]Now we've got ears.
[230:40.19]Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggity dog, hot dog, hot dog, hot diggity dog.
[230:54.66]What's wrong?
[230:55.92]Isn't it like that?
[231:01.06]Uh, let me put the audio back up a little bit.
[231:03.36]It's weird to hear no sounds.
[231:08.00]I think that's better.
[231:25.39]Okay, so hold on a minute.
[231:27.27]Is that the whole Disney catalog of original characters?
[231:30.47]Or is that Mickey Mouse?
[231:31.17]Like, when is Goofy up for auction or whatever?
[231:34.18]Or whatever it is.
[231:35.50]Because they have to like... Is it people gonna... Somebody could buy the copyright?
[231:37.92]Or no, it's just public domain.
[231:40.84]Imagine they auctioned off the characters.
[231:43.36]Holy shit.
[231:46.04]How much do you think that would go for?
[231:47.18]How many people would be in that room?
[231:52.54]Next up is the rights to Donald Duck.
[231:57.10]That place would be full of people.
[231:59.12]Oh, I love this one.
[232:10.24]This is the one that goes down, down, down, down, down, down.
[232:11.92]Yeah, this is the one that goes crazy.
[232:13.04]Yep.
[232:20.52]10 minutes, by the way?
[232:21.22]What do I mean 10 minutes?
[232:25.99]Oh, that's how long I said I was going to be here for.
[232:27.27]But I unplugged my thing.
[232:30.15]Oh, what the fuck?
[232:37.33]I still haven't replaced this.
[232:38.23]It's still broken.
[232:38.85]Alright, that's good.
[232:49.08]Gosh, Mickey.
[232:53.02]Who would go for the least amount of money?
[232:56.08]Between Goofy, Donald, and... Okay, Goofy, Donald, Pluto.
[233:00.49]Like, Daisy.
[233:09.15]Because Minnie and Minnie are... They're billion dollar characters, right?
[233:14.11]You think Pluto would go for the least?
[233:15.97]I don't know about that.
[233:16.83]I think Pluto is pretty iconic.
[233:30.42]Pluto or Daisy.
[233:31.36]I guess Pluto doesn't talk.
[233:35.78]So if you wanted to sell used Toyotas with Pluto, you couldn't do that.
[233:44.66]Unless they wanted to make him talk.
[233:49.43]What would Pluto sound like?
[233:54.71]Goofy can talk and Pluto can't.
[233:56.23]Explain that.
[233:59.33]Because, I don't know, the four of them stepped in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle ooze.
[234:06.21]And Pluto didn't.
[234:30.98]Pluto would sound like a gangster.
[234:33.39]Like a 30s gangster.
[234:36.61]You'd be like, come on, get out.
[234:37.69]What do you say about that?
[234:38.55]Come on now, you see?
[234:39.61]Like that?
[234:40.01]I don't know.
[234:41.93]I don't think so.
[234:44.55]No, I don't think so.
[234:53.60]No, no way.
[234:54.80]He'd be... Because he's lovable, dopey, funny...
[235:01.99]What would Pluto talk like?
[235:03.09]Let's see.
[235:07.89]Well, think of the other talking dog that exists, right?
[235:11.11]Other talking dog.
[235:12.65]And when I say talking dog, I don't mean goofy.
[235:14.29]I don't mean dog.
[235:16.61]On all fours, dogs.
[235:18.75]Scooby-Doo, right?
[235:20.31]On all fours.
[235:20.85]They're a dog.
[235:21.55]Scooby-Doo's not supposed to be like a talking character.
[235:23.58]He's a dog on all fours.
[235:28.82]So Pluto would have to be in that same category.
[235:32.34]Right?
[235:35.80]Pluto's not going to be like Brian Griffin.
[235:37.64]Like, oh, hey, what's going on?
[235:38.36]It's me, Pluto.
[235:39.48]Yeah, I like martinis.
[235:43.26]I did that joke like a week ago.
[235:44.35]I don't care.
[235:44.71]But seriously, Pluto would probably be more dog-like.
[235:55.37]Let me think.
[235:55.95]It would be some type of range.
[235:58.21]I don't think it would be as goofball as Scooby-Doo is.
[236:05.34]What other dog on all fours talks?
[236:06.78]I think it's just Scooby-Doo.
[236:09.10]It's Scooby-Doo.
[236:16.88]Astro.
[236:17.40]Oh, that's right!
[236:18.12]Yeah, Astro's in that same category where he's like, Right?
[236:24.90]The dogs on all fours always talk like goofy.
[236:30.82]Chucky!
[236:31.24]I love you, Roach!
[236:34.78]So if we use that same exact kind of barometer for how they're supposed to talk, then Pluto would be in the same category.
[236:45.63]What would he do?
[236:46.17]I feel like it would be very tongue voice.
[236:50.47]Like the tongue is always out.
[236:52.97]But, like...
[236:55.72]You know what I mean?
[236:56.30]Because he's always... I feel like that'd be a gimmick.
[236:59.60]Like, right?
[236:59.99]It'd be kind of a... His tongue's always out.
[237:09.59]And it'd probably be very playful.
[237:14.89]Like... It'd be something like that.
[237:20.51]I could perfect it.
[237:44.63]Where's the ladder?
[237:52.28]It would be a lot of tongue.
[237:54.84]Tongue's just always hanging out.
[237:56.34]That would be the gimmick for that dog on all fours.
[238:06.13]I don't think Pluto makes sense.
[238:07.39]Wait, did, um... What's the Garfield dog?
[238:12.17]Asteroid?
[238:12.71]What's the- no, the dog from Garfield.
[238:15.77]Did he talk?
[238:16.73]Wait, he did for one episode, didn't he?
[238:18.78]Odie, right.
[238:21.50]Didn't Odie talk for an episode?
[238:34.32]I swear to God, there was an episode where Odie drank like a magic potion and could talk.
[238:48.47]What am I thinking of?
[238:52.21]Spike from Tom and Jerry.
[238:56.97]Hold on.
[238:57.61]Spike from Tom and Jerry.
[239:04.33]It's not on all fours.
[239:07.85]Yeah, he's bipedal.
[239:10.87]Yeah, he's not on all fours.
[239:19.55]Yeah, he literally walks on two feet.
[239:22.82]I'm talking about on all fours, you are a dog on all fours.
[239:26.98]What about Bolt?
[239:27.92]Bolt?
[239:34.72]Bolt the dog.
[239:35.94]Bolt the dog talks?
[239:52.41]Oh shit, this is the desktop.
[239:58.13]Fuck!
[239:59.49]This ruins everything for me.
[240:02.59]This blows up the whole theory.
[240:07.17]Bolt doesn't have like a weird thing he does, like he doesn't go like, at the end of every sentence does he go like, or something weird.
[240:14.79]no I don't know I I I thought I knew hey give me something here because this is pigeons are useless I need someone on the inside someone close to the green-eyed man this is a movie though and it's like a celebrity was this role right it doesn't that doesn't it doesn't count Beverly hills what is this
[240:46.20]Beverly Hills Chihuahua?
[240:48.36]What the fuck is this?
[240:57.25]What the fuck is this?
[241:01.39]Welcome to the home of the rich and famous
[241:08.56]Can I show this on stream?
[241:09.82]I don't think I can.
[241:10.64]No, this doesn't count either.
[241:11.62]This doesn't count.
[241:12.76]I'll tell you why this doesn't count.
[241:14.06]Hold on.
[241:14.26]The reason why this doesn't count is because this is a real dog.
[241:32.98]haha, funny, real dog that we CGI'd a mouth on.
[241:38.42]That's what makes this different.
[241:39.53]This is not the same.
[241:45.27]This is different because this is a CG, this is not a... Oh my fucking god, this is so stupid.
[241:56.86]It's not easy to find a mate with papers.
[241:59.56]Hey, talk to the paw.
[242:01.28]Yeah, this doesn't count.
[242:02.02]This doesn't count.
[242:03.80]Is the one dog who's his own man.
[242:06.03]Who is that hunk of chihuahua?
[242:09.83]If you ever need someone to lick inside your ears.
[242:18.59]Doesn't count.
[242:20.05]Because it's a- it's a- the whole gimmick of the movie is, look, it's real actors and it's real dogs, but their mouths are CG'd.
[242:28.42]No, I'm talking about a created character that's so- it's not a real animal.
[242:39.12]Bolt is close.
[242:40.34]Bolt, I think, ruins my theory.
[242:42.49]101 Dalmatians.
[242:52.83]Wait, Fat Albert's dog talked?
[242:55.93]How many talk?
[242:56.81]No, no.
[242:59.88]Lady and the Tramp.
[243:01.34]They talked?
[243:03.16]Wait a minute.
[243:09.62]Fuck, they did talk.
[243:11.18]Yeah, they talked a lot.
[243:22.69]Did they?
[243:24.29]Was it weird talking, though?
[243:29.94]I can't.
[243:30.48]This is so dumb.
[243:32.62]Grammarly helps make your writing clear.
[243:35.76]Yeah, wait till Grammarly uses Mickey Mouse.
[243:38.32]Does anybody else?
[243:38.88]Okay, look, Grammarly, I don't know how good the product is.
[243:44.20]I have no idea.
[243:45.00]It's probably awesome.
[243:45.95]I wonder, right?
[243:47.53]That being said, I wonder how much money they spend on marketing because half of every ad I've ever received for the last almost five straight years has been Grammarly.
[243:58.95]They must have a monster marketing budget.
[244:02.27]Monster.
[244:03.19]That has to be like half the whole company's net worth.
[244:06.70]Right?
[244:07.00]How would it be possible for them to show ads for this long?
[244:14.71]Right?
[244:14.91]Right?
[244:17.69]I did not... What the fuck is this video that I just put in here?
[244:21.94]Am I getting a second ad?
[244:26.68]Okay, that was weird.
[244:29.20]Alright, so anyways, let's see.
[244:34.80]Shit, they do talk.
[244:36.44]Whatever.
[244:37.42]Did the animals talk to the people?
[244:39.92]Okay, alright.
[244:41.51]I'm not playing anymore.
[244:49.91]They talk.
[244:50.23]Whatever.
[245:08.77]All dogs go to heaven.
[245:10.35]Yeah.
[245:11.55]What about non-movie?
[245:13.97]TV show.
[245:17.70]Movies is a different story.
[245:18.72]What about TV show?
[245:19.34]Encourage the cowardly dog.
[245:24.76]Yeah, but he stands up.
[245:27.68]What is Martha?
[245:28.90]Martha?
[245:34.64]Martha speaks.
[245:37.48]Martha speaks.
[245:40.38]Shit!
[245:40.68]Do they all talk?
[245:41.56]Goddammit, whatever.
[245:42.60]Wilfred?
[245:43.18]Dog with a blog.
[246:11.72]What is dog with a blog?
[246:17.41]What is this nonsense?
[246:20.69]Wait a second.
[246:23.31]Okay, where is it?
[246:26.57]I need to show it.
[246:27.47]Dog with a blog, Disney Channel.
[246:31.25]Wait, what?
[246:43.75]dog with a blog Disney channel okay I have a surprise for you alright he's making noises he's a rescue from the shelter coming soon to Disney channel thank you I've always wanted a dog there's just one little thing give me this stinking food I'm drooling a pool no but this doesn't count because he's a he's a real dog uh no
[247:20.06]Wait, what do you mean let mom and dad find out?
[247:21.84]They can't hear him?
[247:22.64]I want to watch this show.
[247:23.94]Why is this reverse Santa?
[247:25.84]Don't tell mom and dad the dog can talk.
[247:28.98]I don't understand.
[247:48.54]This looks bad.
[247:49.24]I want to watch it.
[247:52.12]October, this is probably from 10 years ago.
[247:53.97]Alright.
[247:55.33]Still, but you understand my point.
[247:58.89]Three, two dogs that have ever existed, that have ever been created as characters, have a funny dog voice, if they're on all fours.
[248:06.74]It's been two ever.
[248:08.32]So, I would think Pluto would be the third.
[248:16.64]Nine years ago.
[248:19.16]That's insane.
[248:23.93]That was the turn of the Disney Channel century, right?
[248:27.89]Where every show was just friends for kids.
[248:38.48]What about Underdog?
[248:39.60]Underdog stood up right.
[248:45.86]And they're still doing it.
[248:46.52]I don't even know.
[248:47.76]People always say, oh, wow, the Disney Channel, like, all those shows are sucking, they're boring, and they're dumb, and they're just soulless.
[248:53.17]Well, how can they keep making them?
[248:54.99]Somebody has to be watching them.
[249:01.77]Alright, where's this?
[249:02.87]I had 2%.
[249:16.27]Alright, give me the list.
[249:21.16]Oh, nice.
[249:21.50]It's still there.
[249:22.16]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[249:22.98]Okay, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[249:26.08]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[249:27.94]Go back.
[249:29.50]Go back, get out.
[249:29.96]Uh, I need details.
[249:33.61]Okay.
[249:34.95]Gutters, the porch.
[249:40.43]Alright, gutters and the porch.
[249:41.89]Over here.
[249:43.91]Does cat dog count?
[249:46.77]Um, a little, but cat dog has a funny voice.
[249:50.47]A dog is like this, right?
[249:54.78]And cat is like this.
[249:55.88]It's like, oh, cat dog.
[249:57.80]No, that's not like a human talking.
[250:06.72]That's done.
[250:13.20]You talk like that.
[250:16.49]I don't talk like that.
[250:20.39]Crypto the super currency?
[250:30.98]Dog from Johnny Test.
[250:35.96]Did he stand upright though?
[250:37.58]I feel like that he was like a person.
[250:39.48]He stood upright, didn't he?
[250:53.70]We have to eliminate real dogs that have a CG mouth.
[250:57.75]That doesn't count.
[251:03.13]The only one I've really seen was that Martha one.
[251:05.58]That fits that category.
[251:20.61]What about Paw Patrol?
[251:21.81]Yeah, but they drive cars and shit.
[251:24.15]Pluto doesn't drive a car.
[251:26.15]Scooby Doo doesn't drive a car.
[251:31.79]You have to sit upright to drive a car.
[251:37.16]They fly planes and stuff.
[251:51.36]What about the wonder pets?
[251:54.76]Um... You're moving the goalpost.
[251:58.06]I think the things I'm saying are very... They're valid points.
[252:06.30]Dog with a blog.
[252:10.60]Look at how beautiful this house looks.
[252:17.57]What about Clifford the big red dog?
[252:19.93]Um... Hold on.
[252:20.61]Did Clifford...
[252:24.93]I always thought that he had a funny voice.
[252:26.11]Alright, Elizabeth.
[252:30.35]Shit, they all have normal voices.
[252:59.74]I just skipped the whole episode.
[253:00.76]I just want to hear Clifford talk.
[253:05.69]Yeah, he's normal.
[253:15.47]Damn it.
[253:17.79]What about the live action Clifford?
[253:23.81]Your whole point has been ruined.
[253:24.87]It doesn't matter.
[253:26.37]The point still stands.
[253:27.71]Pluto would not have a normal voice.
[253:31.12]Can we, okay.
[253:32.38]Let's do a poll.
[253:33.88]At least give me the benefit of the doubt here.
[253:35.96]Let's throw a poll up.
[253:38.86]Would Pluto have a normal voice?
[253:49.75]I don't think he would.
[253:50.41]Alright, let me go back to my soundtrack.
[253:59.69]What was it?
[254:02.97]Brawl soundtrack.
[254:16.12]Animal Crossing, sounds good.
[254:20.96]Okay.
[254:22.48]Uh, the porch fences.
[254:25.94]Porch fences and gutters.
[254:43.59]None of Mickey Mouse and friends have normal voices.
[254:48.04]I think they kind of do.
[254:49.96]Mickey?
[254:51.00]Um... Daisy?
[254:55.64]Yes, they do.
[254:56.18]Yeah, they do.
[255:06.47]They have... Yeah, they're normal.
[255:08.68]They're kind of normal.
[255:09.56]Goofy's is just kind of a low...
[255:12.63]A very low, booming voice.
[255:14.09]Like, gosh, Mickey.
[255:16.17]Oh, how are you, Mickey?
[255:18.37]People talk like that.
[255:27.23]That is normal.
[255:27.83]How is that not normal?
[255:29.77]I just did it.
[255:32.25]Oh, gosh, Mickey.
[255:33.35]Oh, hey, guys.
[255:34.17]It's me, Germo.
[255:35.62]I'm here just having a swell time on my channel.
[255:40.22]There are people that actually talk like that.
[255:41.62]What are you talking about?
[255:49.76]Donald is the one that's not normal.
[255:50.88]No, 82%, thank you.
[256:21.32]My god, clean it already.
[256:28.72]And then the gutter's over here.
[256:36.45]You just spent an hour proving nothing.
[256:41.67]Well, I sure did.
[256:44.01]I just spent an hour proving I don't know very many dogs.
[256:49.13]That are on all fours to talk.
[256:51.25]That's what you should took from that.
[256:57.40]And guess what?
[256:58.00]Neither did you.
[256:59.50]Until probably ten minutes ago.
[257:22.74]Gutters.
[257:24.34]Posts.
[257:36.93]Post.
[257:37.33]Post.
[257:37.75]Gutters.
[257:43.31]In here.
[257:43.89]Alright, gotta get up.
[257:51.60]Use the ladder.
[257:53.88]I just did!
[258:21.05]Is that it?
[258:24.45]No.
[258:27.81]The gutters.
[258:29.93]Something over here.
[258:38.60]Come on, it's one little thing.
[258:48.43]Posts.
[258:50.82]and window frames.
[258:51.84]What do you mean post?
[258:53.76]Posts?
[258:59.05]What window frame?
[259:12.75]Not this, right?
[259:27.18]Window frames.
[259:27.92]Which window frame?
[259:33.98]Under the frame?
[259:45.89]Tab?
[259:48.00]Yeah, it's not showing up.
[260:02.68]Window frame.
[260:08.98]What?
[260:17.31]Now what?
[260:17.69]Posts.
[260:19.69]Oh my god.
[260:20.45]Come on!
[260:27.46]game sucks no it doesn't how dare you I'm furious with that person furious with them
[260:54.84]This post is fine.
[260:55.74]This one's not.
[261:07.45]Ugh!
[261:09.25]What's the problem?
[261:10.09]Got it.
[261:23.88]Beautiful.
[261:29.70]Alright, I got 710 bucks.
[261:30.84]I need 1250 for that.
[261:41.71]I could get this.
[261:52.47]I'm just gonna save the money.
[261:53.21]Now I'm gonna go finish the other one.
[262:02.80]Back to the playground.
[262:03.52]Alright, where was I?
[262:12.06]Alright, I want new music.
[262:19.87]Oh, let's go to retro.
[262:25.19]Yep.
[262:27.19]Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[262:44.26]Alright, let's do the big one.
[262:45.06]Uh, I can get it with this, right?
[262:48.13]Let's do soap.
[262:49.33]Why not?
[262:49.61]This is a multi-purpose cleaner.
[263:06.34]Waste of money?
[263:06.82]It kind of is.
[263:07.68]This is not that good.
[263:08.52]Okay, this sucks.
[263:10.92]It's not worth it.
[263:16.16]Actually not worth it.
[263:16.86]This is terrible.
[263:20.86]Here we go.
[263:40.32]Damn it.
[263:40.70]I keep fucking it up.
[263:51.02]I get it all?
[263:52.12]Yeah.
[263:56.12]Why does he play one second of each one of these songs?
[264:10.99]I'm already at 30%.
[264:20.81]Because the songs are one second long.
[264:23.47]They are?
[264:23.89]These look much longer than this.
[264:28.42]Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[264:55.91]Back to Animal Crossing.
[264:56.75]No, I want, I want lips.
[264:58.44]What's, what's the, the, the lipstick song?
[265:00.34]What's it called?
[265:07.78]Do they have a list here?
[265:15.90]Let's see.
[265:19.22]There we go.
[265:23.59]What's it called?
[265:24.55]No, shit, it's not here.
[265:34.81]Yeah, from, uh, Panel de Pawn.
[265:37.43]Yeah, this is the one!
[265:38.33]This one is- this one's on fire!
[265:58.97]They play Plock?
[266:08.60]What happened to this game?
[266:09.40]Nintendo has access to so many characters and so many things that are cool.
[266:41.10]Play a hundred gets.
[266:46.95]Get off of that one.
[266:48.39]We did that already.
[266:49.33]The best part of this song is that
[267:12.05]Alright, this thing is done.
[267:37.52]How is this not clean?
[267:46.09]Oh, this might be like the four hour version of the song.
[267:59.06]Good.
[268:00.16]Keep it on.
[268:13.33]Oh, come on.
[268:14.35]Why is this not clean?
[268:16.65]It looks perfect!
[268:24.68]There we go, finally, alright.
[268:26.90]Looks good.
[268:32.08]Oh, it's the 30 minute version, right.
[268:38.18]I wanna hear the Angel Island Zone.
[268:40.65]From Brawl.
[268:42.51]Now that one was also really good, and I don't even like these games.
[269:10.06]Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up.
[269:15.99]Uh, these corners here.
[269:16.75]I'm really tired of the part where the drummer really picks up right here.
[269:25.82]He starts, like, fucking screaming right there.
[269:29.58]In the audience, you just see the drummer just going nuts right there.
[269:34.53]He's opening his mouth and closing it, like, opening his mouth and closing it.
[269:49.74]This is dirty.
[269:50.14]Look at how sparkly it is over there.
[270:10.40]I love it.
[270:12.04]They in it again.
[270:14.34]Brawl had the best soundtrack.
[270:15.33]It really did.
[270:20.44]You know, they got real comfy.
[270:22.44]They got real comfortable after Brawl.
[270:24.86]Remember how big of a deal this was?
[270:26.14]They have all these songs from other franchises, some of them which are not even Nintendo.
[270:33.31]It was a huge fucking deal.
[270:41.01]And I think after the Brawl soundtrack, it was kind of just like, yeah, we're just gonna put music in.
[270:48.18]They made a really big deal about this.
[271:02.05]Why is this park covered in shit?
[271:08.21]Ultimate has a massive OST.
[271:11.77]Yeah, but I'll be honest, I only played Ultimate for a week because I got discouraged because of how badly I got shit on and online that I was like, I'm never playing this game ever again.
[271:37.40]online sucks and it's too bad because smash brothers is one of the only fighting games that I actually understand alright now let's do um you know it's true he's told that story more than a few times oh yeah
[272:05.58]Oh, okay.
[272:06.92]Sorry, fighting game.
[272:07.78]I have to put a quote or an asterisk next to it.
[272:10.78]It's not a fighting game, it's a party game.
[272:14.32]The game where you fight each other with essentially health bars.
[272:17.92]It's a fighting game.
[272:22.53]Mario versus Luigi, they beat the shit out of each other, and one of them loses the fight.
[272:28.51]That's a fighting game.
[272:32.44]Now, it might not be a very in-depth fighting game, if you really want to call it that.
[272:37.24]It's not a fighting game.
[272:38.24]It is.
[272:38.56]They're fighting each other.
[272:39.34]The characters are fighting on screen.
[272:43.42]You could call it a party game, too, but it's also a fighting game.
[272:46.09]You pick a character, and one of us wins and one of us loses.
[272:57.21]COD is a fighting game.
[273:01.88]Dynasty Warriors is a fighting game.
[273:03.20]It's not a fighting game.
[273:08.31]Well, what makes a fighting game a fighting game, then?
[273:11.59]What makes a fighting game?
[273:18.72]No, it's not.
[273:23.06]You could say Madden is a fighting game, couldn't you?
[273:27.50]2D melee combat.
[273:32.35]Well, the Hadouken is not melee.
[273:33.71]It has to have frame data and special moves.
[273:47.90]Chips are dinner.
[273:49.12]What are you talking about?
[273:51.44]Why did you say that?
[273:52.82]Chips are dinner?
[273:54.36]They could be.
[273:55.64]They can be if you eat chips for dinner.
[273:59.74]Who said that?
[274:00.33]That's funny.
[274:03.69]Is that Joel?
[274:04.33]Ah, it's fucking... What a hilarious joke.
[274:08.67]You can eat chips for dinner.
[274:09.87]It sucks.
[274:10.45]It's bad for you.
[274:11.65]You can also... You can eat hamburger meat for dinner.
[274:17.39]Literally, Smash is a fighting game.
[274:18.72]What do I want to put on for music?
[274:31.02]Smash is a kid's game.
[274:32.18]Okay, is it a kid's fighting game?
[274:37.32]Party game to me is like... Oh, let's put on, um, let's put on, uh, let's put the Tekken soundtrack on.
[274:51.10]I don't know, you call it whatever you want, but I remember playing, like, Tekken and playing, like, Virtua Fighter and shit, and those games, I remember just playing it with friends, and you'd get punched, like, three times, and you'd go, KO, knockout!
[275:04.85]You just, like, fell off the fucking level.
[275:06.43]It wasn't fun.
[275:10.53]I remember getting caught in, like, a Tekken combo, and I just didn't even get to play the game.
[275:21.07]I feel like I wasn't pressing the buttons hard enough in some of those games.
[275:28.37]Tekken also isn't 2D.
[275:30.01]That's right.
[275:33.31]Let's put on Tekken OST.
[275:40.41]I remember just walking outside of bounds accidentally in Virtua Fighter and never playing it again.
[275:58.33]Is Smash like a competitive fighting game?
[276:00.51]I mean, a lot of people would tell you that melee is.
[276:05.23]What separates melee from any other fighting game?
[276:07.55]Okay, if you do no items, no bullshit, just fighting each other, how is it different?
[276:24.15]Not this debate.
[276:26.93]Okay, like Brawl, I would classify maybe not as a fighting game because you can just trip for no reason.
[276:32.09]It's just, and that's, maybe that's not a fighting game.
[276:34.81]I don't know.
[276:43.02]Like, imagine in Street Fighter if all of a sudden your character fell down, like, 1% of the time.
[276:51.08]It would suck for a lot of these competitive players.
[277:00.42]Dakarai himself said Smash is not a fighting game, so there's no debate.
[277:04.19]I mean... But it's not... We're just playing semantics, though.
[277:38.75]Oh, look at how dirty this edge is.
[277:41.11]It's an action game?
[277:42.94]It's an action party game that includes fighting people on a stage to reduce their health to zero and reduce their lives to zero.
[277:52.44]Alright.
[278:10.87]Reduce 100%.
[278:11.29]That's a fighting game.
[278:16.30]Yeah.
[278:17.04]I mean, I would say that's a fighting game.
[278:18.76]But then, like somebody said, is COD a fighting game?
[278:22.53]It's you and me versus each other on like a battlefield.
[278:25.51]And I'm trying to reduce your health to zero while we fight each other and shoot each other.
[278:32.66]Why do we have to have all these rules?
[278:34.30]Why can't we just... whatever.
[278:45.64]Guns make it a shooter.
[278:48.27]Hmm.
[278:50.45]Well, Striker is in Mortal Kombat.
[278:55.03]He has a gun.
[279:06.56]Joker has a gun.
[279:08.14]Oh.
[279:13.95]Isn't there a character in Tekken that's literally... It's like a kangaroo with boxing gloves on?
[279:19.78]That's pretty much a Smash character.
[279:23.36]I don't think it matters what the weapon you're using is.
[279:29.80]I really don't think so.
[279:32.53]It's a bear.
[279:33.57]Who's the kangaroo?
[279:34.97]Roger.
[279:35.35]Yeah, there's a raptor as well.
[279:36.73]What game is that?
[279:50.18]Second three?
[279:50.76]There's a kangaroo and two bears.
[280:04.19]There's no role-playing in most RPGs.
[280:16.21]That's right.
[280:16.65]Yeah, so who cares?
[280:17.87]Like, what does it matter?
[280:37.67]Well, I mean, I will say that makes up a lot of them.
[280:53.28]Makes up a lot of the characters.
[281:06.14]But here's the one thing I will say about Smash to kind of rebuttal.
[281:09.80]Look, I don't like that there's anime character with sword for 10 characters either.
[281:15.31]Here's where I rebuttal that.
[281:16.39]It's the only way I can rebuttal this.
[281:17.79]It's the only way that makes sense to me.
[281:19.95]There's like 85 Smash characters.
[281:24.73]Isn't there like 100 playable characters in the Switch one?
[281:28.31]That's so many characters.
[281:34.81]I guess at some point you're gonna make a few more protagonists with sword.
[281:40.32]There's 80 in the Switch one.
[281:41.64]That's so many.
[281:44.06]How many characters were in Tekken?
[281:47.48]Twelve?
[281:48.64]Fifteen?
[281:59.77]Fifty?
[282:01.41]What?
[282:04.34]There are not 50 characters in Tekken.
[282:07.00]No way.
[282:10.88]How... How many characters are in Tekken 4?
[282:17.75]23 characters in Tekken 4.
[282:18.63]Alright, Tekken 5.
[282:19.03]32 in Tekken 5.
[282:19.43]Tekken 6.
[282:20.87]39 in Tekken 6.
[282:21.23]Tekken 7.
[282:21.43]36 in Tekken 7.
[282:21.87]Tekken 8.
[282:22.15]51 characters.
[282:34.53]Wait, this is not out yet.
[282:38.05]Okay, so Tekken 8's not out yet.
[282:41.69]So, but even still, in the Tekken that's not out yet, 51 characters are planned for Tekken 8.
[282:50.60]There are 80 in Smash Bros., so I'm...
[282:54.33]How many characters are there in Street Fighter?
[282:56.47]Street Fighter... I don't even know anything about Street Fighter.
[283:00.18]They release the same Street Fighter like Skyrim style five times every year or two.
[283:05.26]Street Fighter 5 has come out like four times.
[283:07.34]How many Street Fighters have there been?
[283:08.38]Street Fighter 6?
[283:11.29]How many characters are in Street Fighter 6?
[283:13.45]Eight?!
[283:16.07]There are only eight characters in Street Fighter 6?! !
[283:23.60]How many characters in Street Fighter 5?
[283:25.62]16.
[283:26.50]It's not out yet.
[283:27.40]Oh.
[283:35.34]Dude, we gotta stop numbering shit.
[283:37.14]I'm serious.
[283:39.31]Stop numbering video games.
[283:41.35]Especially ones that are in a series like this.
[283:45.54]Like, we're gonna get to eventually, like, Tekken 17?
[283:50.14]Why?
[283:51.12]Call it, like, Tekken?
[283:52.62]The Battle for Azeroth, or whatever the hell you want to call it.
[283:56.51]After 5, it's like, alright.
[283:58.65]Do we really need to, how many are you gonna number?
[284:00.91]Like, 10, 12, 15, 20?
[284:07.53]I made this joke on Twitter, and I'm gonna make it on here now, too.
[284:10.57]Because it's been, like, 6 and a half years.
[284:14.40]When you get to the point where your numbered franchise has as many numbers as the Jason movies, it's time to figure out another title.
[284:36.61]Think about this.
[284:37.25]In 20 more years,
[284:40.36]Trying to remember when Street Fighter 7 or 8 came out is gonna be, like, impossible.
[284:46.70]Alright, Street Fighter 4 was, wait, when the fuck was that?
[284:50.48]Street Fighter 2?
[284:50.90]Street Fighter 16?
[284:54.80]I don't remember.
[284:55.42]When did that character come out?
[284:56.40]Street Fighter 70?
[284:56.80]I don't know.
[285:06.94]Or if you want to number them, just do it like they, yeah, give it the year.
[285:11.92]Like Street Fighter 95.
[285:13.84]Street Fighter 2006.
[285:14.42]So then I can at least know when the hell it was.
[285:17.55]Street Fighter 2020.
[285:20.43]Like I know when that was.
[285:28.01]Sonic 06.
[285:28.83]Yeah, I know exactly when that came out.
[285:32.13]In the barrage of Sonic the Hedgehog video games, I know exactly what that game was.
[285:37.32]I know the precise opening cutscene, I know all the characters in it, I know the exact game.
[285:53.91]Sonic Oak 6 came out in 2005.
[286:04.83]Whatever.
[286:05.29]It's still that same period.
[286:06.37]It's fine.
[286:09.83]What's the name of the princess in Sonic 06?
[286:12.47]Oh, I don't know anything.
[286:14.65]Eliza.
[286:16.61]Elisa.
[286:17.99]One of those.
[286:18.49]I know it's one.
[286:19.37]It's close.
[286:22.55]Elise.
[286:23.23]Oh, oh, what?
[286:24.13]I don't know.
[286:24.61]I was very close.
[286:35.79]Eliza.
[286:37.33]I don't know.
[286:37.95]It was one of that.
[286:39.66]Why did I know that?
[286:40.34]Because Sonic 06.
[286:41.74]I remember the whole game because it was 06.
[286:43.12]I know the exact year.
[286:44.28]I know the exact place I was sitting.
[286:46.03]Calm down.
[286:46.55]I'm calm.
[287:00.83]I remember, I have a very, very distinct memory of Sonic 06.
[287:04.58]You know why?
[287:05.00]Because I thought that game was weird as shit.
[287:09.26]Isn't that the game where there's like real people?
[287:13.28]And you're in like a real like human city and shit, and there's like real people?
[287:17.62]It was really weird to me.
[287:30.39]It wasn't the typical, oh, you got the cat, you've got, uh, you got the, the slug guy, you've got the, the, the bat person, you've got the Amy, right?
[287:41.06]It was, they were humans in cutscenes interacting with Sonic.
[287:44.61]It was, it was kind of strange.
[288:00.32]Mario Odyssey did that.
[288:04.90]But in Sonic 06, the characters were very lifelike human characters.
[288:10.09]Like CG human characters.
[288:14.19]Very high-detailed humans.
[288:21.45]They were not in Odyssey.
[288:22.31]They were not very high-detailed human characters in Odyssey.
[288:31.85]They were human characters in Odyssey, but they weren't like super high quality, high detailed facial structures and stuff, were they?
[288:39.02]I don't remember that.
[288:49.46]They were like a cartoon, right?
[288:52.10]Sonic 06 had cartoon style of Sonic, and then these highly detailed human real people.
[289:16.23]This is almost done.
[289:24.85]Sonic 06 was not originally a Sonic game.
[289:26.94]Is that why?
[289:27.38]What was it supposed to be?
[289:41.50]Who said that?
[289:42.08]Somebody did.
[289:42.48]It was supposed to be a Final Fantasy game?
[289:46.20]Was it?
[289:48.93]It was called Humans 06.
[289:50.29]Oh, that's great.
[289:54.27]Give that person a badge or something.
[290:00.17]I need music.
[290:00.79]How about... How about... Cupcakes!
[290:13.03]How about... Cupcakes!
[290:17.18]Um, how about... Mega Man, that sounds good.
[290:29.10]Mega Man... See, this is another problem.
[290:33.17]I know there's a few songs in Mega Man that I would like.
[290:35.65]I don't know if it's Mega Man 3 or Mega Man 10.
[290:37.75]I'm gonna go with Mega Man 3.
[290:59.65]Mega Man 06.
[291:00.07]This thing is dirty.
[291:09.82]It's definitely Mega Man 3.
[291:16.93]Pick the right one.
[291:36.41]Under the chin.
[291:36.93]I'm stuck in here.
[291:46.17]I want to throw, like, a water grenade right here.
[291:52.60]And then just, boom, like a clean grenade.
[291:55.40]He looks pretty good.
[292:08.46]Water balloon.
[292:09.18]Yeah, but a big one.
[292:12.60]Water bazooka?
[292:13.64]Yep.
[292:19.65]I just said that to you like I was being asked by my mother if I was ready for school when I was still sleeping.
[292:27.43]Yep.
[292:35.26]Honey, are you already ready?
[292:36.44]Yep, yep.
[292:39.35]That was my favorite thing.
[292:43.91]I always said, I'm just putting my socks on.
[292:46.01]That was the way to get away from it.
[292:48.11]Yeah, I'm just putting my socks on with my eyes closed.
[292:50.88]I'm still in bed.
[292:53.20]I don't know why that worked.
[293:02.62]I guess because putting socks on kind of is a pain in the ass sometimes, maybe?
[293:06.08]Like that takes a while for some reason in my child brain.
[293:12.19]And then if you hear your mother start to come towards the room, you hear like the, here comes mom, she's walking towards the door.
[293:19.47]You rip out of the bed as fast as you fucking can.
[293:23.40]You feel horrible, you feel like shit.
[293:25.30]But you immediately grab the fucking pair of socks and like you're struggling to put it on your foot.
[293:31.06]And she comes in, are you ready?
[293:32.68]Yeah, I just walked on like you're just so fucked up And then you hear the door close you look over and you just lie right back down And then you do it all over again, and then your mother thinks that there's like something wrong with you Because I was just in here ten minutes ago, and you're still having trouble putting your socks on What are you doing?
[293:57.97]Are you alright?
[294:02.21]You putting the sock on the same foot when I came in here 10 minutes ago There was one time When I didn't want to go to school, I was like I don't want to go to school today fuck that I'm staying home
[294:28.46]You're like, oh, I don't feel good.
[294:29.88]Oh, my stomach hurts.
[294:31.84]Oh, okay.
[294:32.24]Yeah, take your temperature.
[294:33.20]And I took the thermometer and I held it up.
[294:39.24]I held it up to a light bulb when she left the room.
[294:42.99]Like a hot light bulb.
[294:44.19]I held it up right to the light bulb.
[294:45.47]And then when I heard her coming back in, she was coming back in the room and I put it under my tongue.
[294:50.21]I put it like in my mouth.
[294:52.05]And she grabbed it.
[294:54.00]And it was like 110.
[294:56.64]Something fucking crazy.
[294:59.67]And she's like, uh, what is going on?
[295:02.29]Oh, I don't feel good.
[295:06.76]And it was just like, go to school.
[295:09.16]Get up.
[295:15.08]No, but I don't feel good.
[295:16.04]I think I have a temperature.
[295:17.16]Okay, because if you had 108 temperatures, you'd be dead.
[295:20.76]Um, you're still alive, so I don't know what you did here, but get up and go to fucking school.
[295:26.61]And I'd be like, whatever!
[295:29.11]And I would just get up and get ready.
[295:31.89]He stole that from E.T.
[295:33.29]I probably did.
[295:34.49]I probably watched it and thought it would work.
[295:40.79]I used to do that shit.
[295:42.09]I put orange juice in my mouth.
[295:43.99]I'm not making this up.
[295:44.77]This is a fucking real story.
[295:46.69]I put orange juice in my mouth one time.
[295:50.49]And went to... So my grandmother was around.
[295:53.33]My grandmother was watching us at the time.
[295:55.94]And I put orange juice in my mouth and like went on the ground going like, oh no, like I'm going to puke.
[296:04.28]And I went like, bleh, and I spit like three tablespoons of orange juice onto the ground.
[296:09.65]My grandmother was like, what are you doing?
[296:15.46]I was like, I'm sick, see?
[296:21.33]You were a little shit.
[296:22.39]No, I just, no I wasn't.
[296:23.85]It was a tile floor, so it was easy to clean.
[296:26.91]I was like 10.
[296:31.17]And it was, it was very clearly, I put orange juice in my mouth and I was like, I'm, look at me, I'm sick, I'm puking on the ground.
[296:50.07]And it never worked.
[296:50.75]I always thought somehow it was gonna work one day, and it never did.
[296:52.79]It's really funny because if I had just... And I used to do this sometimes.
[296:58.01]If I was like... Like, nah, I'm not really feeling that great.
[297:01.85]I really kind of... I think I need to take like a day.
[297:04.43]I'm like, I don't feel great.
[297:06.36]It was like, okay, yeah, sure.
[297:08.68]But it was the times that I was like, oh, I'm sick!
[297:11.04]Oh, yeah!
[297:13.28]And I would always put on a voice.
[297:14.62]You guys ever do that?
[297:15.98]You ever put on the I'm sick voice?
[297:18.00]Here's the I'm sick voice.
[297:20.93]Mom, I don't feel good.
[297:23.13]Yeah, I don't know.
[297:24.03]Something's wrong.
[297:24.77]I think I have a headache and everything.
[297:27.57]What does that mean?
[297:28.85]It doesn't mean anything.
[297:32.67]No, I don't feel good.
[297:33.97]No, I don't know.
[297:36.35]I don't know.
[297:36.83]I think it's my head is hurting.
[297:39.22]Nobody talks like that.
[297:40.12]Even when you're sick, what are you doing?
[297:44.49]If I had just been honest with my mother, it wouldn't be like, alright, go to school.
[297:49.11]It'd be like, oh, alright, you don't, that's fine.
[297:50.87]Yeah, take a day.
[298:04.49]It was not hard.
[298:05.63]It would just be like, I don't really feel like going to school today.
[298:08.57]I like don't feel like it.
[298:11.19]It's like, alright, is everything alright?
[298:12.39]Like, yeah, I just, I don't know, I just don't wanna.
[298:19.03]Dude, I'm telling you right now, it was a fucking miracle that I, like, passed any school.
[298:25.55]Besides college, I actually, I tried, I really did try in college, I did.
[298:29.58]I wanted to, like, do well, and I wanted to do, like, college stuff, and I really did try.
[298:35.56]But, man, in high school and in middle school, I honestly think I did one homework worksheet in four years.
[298:44.78]I seriously think that.
[298:45.82]I truly believe that.
[298:48.06]And I would just do well on the tests.
[298:50.28]Like, I would just get, like, an 80 or 85 on the tests.
[298:52.49]I just wouldn't ever do homework.
[298:56.31]Ever.
[298:56.45]2.6, Andy.
[298:59.41]Yeah, 2.8.
[298:59.57]What was it?
[299:00.13]2.6? 2.6?
[299:13.56]Same, I hated homework.
[299:14.46]Homework is such a scam.
[299:17.94]It really is.
[299:18.48]Nobody wants to do that shit at their house.
[299:26.01]I don't think it does anything for kids.
[299:27.83]I really don't think it helps retain information.
[299:29.75]I really don't think so.
[299:30.77]I actually don't believe that.
[299:34.27]I think homework makes a little bit of sense.
[299:37.49]It's almost like the teachers are trying just to get you to continue to pay attention or something, but it's like... Like, no, no, no, you have to go back into your house and do this too.
[299:47.49]Because I want to make sure you fucking paid attention today.
[299:49.53]Well, make your class not suck.
[299:52.03]How does that sound?
[299:56.14]And then you have the other problem, is teachers are so underpaid, at least in America.
[300:01.82]We should be paying teachers a shitload of money.
[300:04.14]And I mean it, an absolute metric fuckton of money.
[300:15.07]School should only be four days a week.
[300:17.55]And it shouldn't be six hours.
[300:18.67]It should be like fucking four.
[300:20.79]Pay teachers a shitload of money.
[300:23.67]And it'll be like classes will be better.
[300:25.29]They'll be more interesting.
[300:26.71]Have interesting classes.
[300:27.81]You know what I mean?
[300:29.03]Why is it so hard to figure out?
[300:30.07]This actually is not even that hard of a thing to figure out.
[300:35.98]This is not even difficult.
[300:37.02]This is like common sense.
[300:43.30]I was so unproductive when I was a kid.
[300:46.49]Because I was waking up at 6 o'clock in the morning and going to school for 6 hours.
[300:50.65]I just, it sucked.
[300:52.05]I just didn't want to do it.
[300:53.11]I didn't want to do it.
[300:54.11]Now imagine if school didn't start until fucking 10 or 9.
[301:00.17]And the classes were interesting.
[301:01.37]The teachers really gave a shit.
[301:02.61]Really, really did.
[301:03.19]And there are teachers that do give a shit.
[301:04.37]They do.
[301:04.81]A lot of them.
[301:09.03]Pay the teachers more money.
[301:09.77]If it's $30,000 a year for a teacher, $40,000.
[301:10.83]Double that.
[301:11.19]Overnight.
[301:11.45]Immediately.
[301:11.77]Immediately.
[301:17.03]Holy shit, we're talking about our kids' brains, for God's sake.
[301:37.14]So much more productivity comes in place when people, like, want to do it.
[301:42.06]And they're prepared to do it.
[301:43.18]And they're not being forced to do it.
[301:45.24]I think that's the biggest problem, I really do.
[301:49.92]When I was in school, I felt like I was forced to do it.
[301:53.98]And there were some classes, there were some times where I felt like, oh, actually, you know what, like, doing this math problem, I actually kind of like this.
[301:59.14]It wasn't every day.
[302:00.40]At all.
[302:02.49]It was maybe like a few times, maybe like a few times a week was I really like in the headspace of like, you know what, I guess I can do like a bunch of long division or something, fine.
[302:34.04]And just think, even for the kids that really excel, I'm sure some of you, I'm sure, probably really excel in school.
[302:39.55]I'm sure you do.
[302:41.59]But how much more, how much better would you be doing if you had more tools to do better?
[302:50.14]If the classes were even more interesting, right?
[302:52.54]If, like, your teachers didn't have to fucking fight the budget board to, like, get pens and shit and, like, pencils.
[303:00.10]You know what I mean?
[303:00.62]Like, there's so much things that teachers would like to do.
[303:05.22]Are we having enough money?
[303:06.56]I don't know.
[303:07.54]I don't know.
[303:07.98]I don't think so.
[303:19.42]I would probably still hate school.
[303:21.82]Look, school is school, right?
[303:23.72]You do it, you gotta learn stuff.
[303:25.22]And there's another thing.
[303:27.12]What in the name of God?
[303:28.70]And I'm gonna go off on this, right?
[303:29.84]This is time to do it.
[303:30.59]During the Mega Man song, right?
[303:31.89]I don't care.
[303:32.27]I'm just going off.
[303:33.77]I'm doing it.
[303:36.47]Why do we not teach everybody put a huge emphasis on Like finances and and how to like file a fucking tax return and stuff We spend like an hour on that shit sometimes like maybe one week of like your Your home ec class is about some of this stuff Teach kids what like a credit score is what like a credit card does and
[304:02.37]Financial like literacy like we need to teach this shit to people like we don't it's just oh well, maybe one day.
[304:07.99]They'll figure it out What the hell is school for if not to prepare everybody for adulthood right is to prepare us for the fucking world I'll be honest I Don't really care about like doing math problems or what like Genghis Khan did
[304:32.93]We have Netflix documentaries that can cover that shit in an hour.
[304:45.73]And I'm not saying that stuff's not important.
[304:47.27]It is.
[304:47.85]It is.
[304:48.11]We need to obviously learn about who we are and where... what people are... where they're from, what people have done, what the world was like, what it... what things that happened, major important, of course.
[304:59.14]But to replace... to replace, like, actual life skills and teaching people things that they're gonna need... I think the focus is on preparing people for adulthood, because when you're not prepared for adulthood, then you get stuck.
[305:20.81]Are you running for office?
[305:23.66]Yes.
[305:26.48]No, I'm not.
[305:28.54]This is not even some like, oh wow, he was so brave.
[305:33.11]No, I don't think that.
[305:33.99]I just, I honestly just think.
[305:36.83]You guys know how much, you want to get like angry for a second?
[305:40.69]Look at, at least in the United States.
[305:43.15]Go look at the breakdown of where our federal tax dollars go.
[305:47.16]Just go do it.
[305:47.74]It takes two seconds.
[305:49.32]Go look at where education is.
[305:51.00]How much we spend federally on education.
[305:54.29]Huh?
[305:57.81]What?
[306:06.67]They need to increase that by a huge amount.
[306:10.24]This is not- it's not political.
[306:11.38]This is not political.
[306:12.46]This is just like wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- it is political, whatever.
[306:17.04]I'm breaking my own rules, I know.
[306:18.94]No, it's not political.
[306:20.92]It's not political.
[306:22.46]I'm just telling you to go look.
[306:25.20]We don't spend very much on education at all, and it's incredibly important.
[306:34.90]It's not politics.
[306:36.02]It's just, this is just, whatever.
[306:39.96]It's not a lot, and... Like, why is it not a lot?
[306:43.82]We don't, we... Education is so important.
[306:50.65]Science, medicine, technology, right?
[306:52.47]Like, these are things we need to do.
[306:54.13]Let's go look at the budget one day.
[306:57.53]Let's go look at it.
[306:58.15]And be like, oh, I wonder where our money goes.
[307:00.10]And just look at it.
[307:00.84]Just stare at it for half a minute.
[307:15.97]This is based.
[307:16.85]No, it's not.
[307:17.59]It's not.
[307:18.09]It really isn't.
[307:26.92]This is very based.
[307:28.20]I mean, I just think it's... I think a lot of issues could be solved in our country, in our world, in our country.
[307:35.12]Let me put like fake fucking crowd music.
[307:43.93]I think...
[307:46.77]that a lot of issues in our country can be completely solved by having a much better education system, teaching kids what they need to learn to be an adult.
[308:01.18]I'm talking about financial literacy.
[308:02.42]I'm talking about skills that they'll need to learn to be a functioning adult.
[308:08.68]I'm talking about being able to teach kids not just about history and science and social studies.
[308:14.34]I'm talking life skills, things you need
[308:18.60]It shouldn't be 2% of the budget.
[308:19.98]It should be probably 10%.
[308:26.91]If that's political, I'm sorry.
[308:28.18]Then this is a political stream.
[308:29.62]At the moment.
[308:30.40]Or this moment.
[308:31.06]I don't think it is.
[308:34.47]More money to teachers, more money to programs.
[308:36.83]Like, you take a look at, like, that, that, you take a, you take a look at what are, like, our programs that are suffering right now.
[308:42.43]Extracurricular shit to, like, like, our arts and, and, and the arts programs are all just suffering.
[308:48.66]You know what I mean?
[308:49.20]Like, what the hell's going on?
[308:55.64]Oh, I'm looking at my phone.
[309:02.30]Hold your applause for a second.
[309:03.34]I had to look at my phone.
[309:12.11]No, but seriously.
[309:14.92]Programs like, okay, when we did the archaeology thing.
[309:18.54]Like the science center.
[309:21.00]They do virtual field trips and shit.
[309:22.92]Imagine how awesome that would be if that was just a part of everybody's lives as a kid.
[309:28.49]More field trips.
[309:29.55]Do more cool shit.
[309:30.85]I don't want to go to the same place for a field trip.
[309:36.35]I don't want a field trip to just be we go into a bus and go to Dairy Queen.
[309:42.25]That's not a field trip.
[309:43.19]You know how many times I've seen the people, the old time people churn the butter?
[309:55.26]When I was younger?
[309:55.86]Oh, this is what it was like back in the old times.
[310:00.50]I've been to that place like 10 times.
[310:15.53]And go Red Sox!
[310:19.89]Ah, this feels good.
[310:20.77]I like this.
[310:32.34]Okay, okay, okay.
[310:33.66]Shh.
[310:34.85]Thank you.
[310:37.83]No, but seriously, if you go look at where our money goes.
[310:42.66]I think we could really... Stand to put a little more of our... We could restructure our budget a little bit.
[310:50.05]Have... People going to school and shit be really important.
[310:53.87]I guess it is important.
[310:54.85]And not just... Not shitty school.
[310:56.61]Not dumb school.
[310:57.39]Not school that everybody hates going to.
[311:02.03]I don't want to dump a shitload more money into a boring, shitty education system.
[311:08.19]I'm talking about let's redo the whole goddamn thing.
[311:11.04]Make it good.
[311:11.60]Make it fun.
[311:12.14]Make it interesting.
[311:12.78]Make it engaging.
[311:13.70]You know what I mean?
[311:14.18]Then you'd want to do it.
[311:14.96]You'd want to go.
[311:16.76]And fuck Capcom, by the way.
[311:18.38]Yeah.
[311:29.28]You say that at, like, the political, uh, at, like, the big speech.
[311:33.50]At, like, my campaign rally.
[311:36.24]And fuck Capcom!
[311:39.64]What's with the FOV?
[311:40.56]They need to change that.
[311:46.98]And honestly, I don't think it even matters, like, where you even stand politically.
[311:49.38]I think that everybody could probably agree.
[311:53.20]That we gotta, we gotta make our shit a little better, you know what I mean?
[311:55.68]We gotta, like, put another, a higher standard here.
[311:57.82]We gotta make a little bit more
[312:01.08]I don't think that's like a necessarily biased statement to any political leaning.
[312:06.17]I really don't think it is.
[312:29.06]Now, you don't know what I am.
[312:30.78]You don't know how I lean politically.
[312:32.40]I've never talked about it.
[312:33.63]You have no idea.
[312:34.45]You have absolutely no idea.
[312:35.51]You can guess.
[312:38.23]I'm going to keep you guessing.
[312:41.97]But that's not what this stream is for.
[312:43.29]And we talked about that before as well.
[312:45.21]But sometimes, you know, you got to talk about some things.
[312:49.26]I had to.
[312:49.96]I had to.
[312:50.38]That's been on my mind recently.
[312:51.42]It has.
[312:52.36]You literally told us.
[312:53.34]No, I didn't.
[312:53.68]I thought you were a centrist.
[312:56.68]No, when did I say that?
[312:57.56]I said that?
[312:58.10]When did I say that?
[313:00.30]When did I say that?
[313:04.94]Did I get shit-faced one day and say that?
[313:10.87]Was I like drunk on wine and I was like, guys, I'm a centrist.
[313:13.15]When did that happen?
[313:14.11]I don't think that happened.
[313:17.73]That didn't happen.
[313:24.36]You didn't have to say that.
[313:26.06]What are you talking about?
[313:27.08]I've never... It's a fucking secret.
[313:30.43]Of what I believe, alright?
[313:32.97]And don't let anybody ever tell you differently.
[313:37.28]It's obvious.
[313:38.14]What's obvious?
[313:38.84]What do you mean it's obvious?
[313:54.71]Why are you panicking?
[313:55.75]I'm not panicking.
[313:57.13]Whatever.
[314:06.67]It's in your rant section on YouTube, is it?
[314:16.40]You support Vervin Supreme.
[314:20.04]I mean, that guy's fucking hilarious, but I don't know what his policies are.
[314:36.39]I'm already at 60% here.
[314:46.27]Just admit it.
[314:47.91]You watched Bionicle with Biden.
[314:49.43]It's obvious.
[314:58.78]We know.
[314:59.48]You don't know anything.
[315:00.76]Nobody knows anything.
[315:01.86]Let me just pretend that people don't know.
[315:11.01]An anarchist?
[315:11.97]I'm not an anarchist.
[315:12.99]What are you talking about?
[315:32.32]You're a Minecraft anarchist.
[315:35.50]I don't even know what that is.
[315:36.30]I have no idea what I just said.
[315:55.53]The ultimate secret of Jerma985's political leanings.
[315:59.33]Alright, this is good.
[316:12.44]I want more soap.
[316:13.26]Soap is pretty good here.
[316:21.05]Soap is actually good here.
[316:22.73]I gotta get in there.
[316:28.37]How do I get up there?
[316:29.73]Do I have to go across the bars?
[316:35.18]He's a Biblio Boblo Goo Goo Gaga Ding Dongist.
[316:40.08]What is that?
[316:54.53]Sure, I guess.
[316:56.46]Stop playing this?
[316:57.40]Well, I'm having fun.
[316:58.84]I like this.
[317:09.57]There we go.
[317:10.31]Get in there.
[317:17.51]That's my dirt KD.
[317:19.38]Pretty high.
[317:36.91]Show us what you look like without your dentures in.
[317:39.09]Why would I do that?
[317:41.25]I don't like the way I look without my dentures in.
[317:42.75]Why would I do that?
[318:02.50]Stop hotboxing the playground.
[318:06.46]This is open air in here.
[318:08.06]Geriatric Andy.
[318:31.68]I'm not geriatric.
[318:37.20]I am getting older, though.
[318:38.14]You do have that, right?
[318:40.72]It's okay to get older.
[318:41.51]I don't feel a day over 30.
[318:44.05]I definitely feel 30, though.
[318:48.34]In fact, probably a little bit older.
[318:50.10]I don't feel a day over 32.
[318:51.00]You know what I mean?
[319:11.35]I missed it.
[319:11.83]You said something, but I missed it.
[319:18.21]62%.
[319:18.25]Let's go.
[319:18.64]How is it like living past 30?
[319:25.58]I like it.
[319:33.52]I like it.
[319:33.98]I like being 30+.
[319:37.38]Slow down a little bit.
[319:39.93]Takes me a little longer.
[319:40.75]I just like kind of chill.
[319:51.40]Oh, did I not get that?
[319:59.55]You get angry when young people are loud?
[320:01.17]I get angry when anybody gets loud.
[320:15.56]I like that.
[320:16.93]Shrink it.
[320:25.35]I'm a chill, you're not 60.
[320:26.45]Yeah, I can guarantee you that I've lost a step or two, though.
[320:33.12]I mean, look at, I already have like a medical problem, right?
[320:36.64]I didn't have that in my 20s.
[320:38.56]It started in my 30s.
[320:40.81]Already, I can tell you, I've slowed down quite a bit.
[320:54.19]Is there a ladder here?
[320:54.97]Because this is annoying.
[321:02.86]Alright, this is done.
[321:12.97]I'm 20 and I have a bunch of medical problems.
[321:14.43]Is this really a dice roll?
[321:15.91]Yeah, I know.
[321:18.93]That's true.
[321:23.83]I'm sorry to hear that, though.
[321:29.73]Get some music?
[321:30.35]Alright, yeah.
[321:49.81]Thank you.
[322:32.06]Do it!
[322:33.95]What the fuck?
[322:34.71]He didn't even do it.
[322:55.35]Why won't he do it?
[322:58.12]Why was this filed?
[323:00.04]Was the person playing on the wrong file or something?
[323:34.77]Fucking do it!
[323:38.93]Thank you!
[323:50.92]It's not the mandala effect, it's right there.
[323:53.93]I need an actual OST though.
[324:00.11]Um, how about...
[324:08.75]What?
[324:10.44]Donut country?
[324:11.10]Oh, this is nice.
[324:20.59]Sure.
[324:43.82]I have a homework assignment for you guys.
[324:45.34]I know you don't want to do homework.
[324:46.74]I know we just talked about it.
[324:49.16]But that... It's in something else.
[324:54.83]And I don't know what it's in.
[324:56.83]It's been bugging me for like 25 fucking years.
[325:00.75]It's in something else.
[325:04.02]It happens in either another game or a TV show or... And it's been bugging me for like 20 years.
[325:11.48]When's the homework due?
[325:12.22]Next week.
[325:26.85]Oh, this is... Oh my god, this one's horrible.
[325:28.86]I'm buying the soap.
[325:29.54]Let's go.
[325:35.02]It works so much better.
[325:35.76]I can do the rest of the cleanup later with the... Save for the new gun.
[325:59.26]Okay, that's good.
[325:59.96]Now go like this.
[326:03.88]This nozzle is terrible.
[326:11.43]The only thing that takes any dirt up anymore is the green and the yellow and barely the green.
[326:16.27]I need that new gun right now.
[326:21.89]Was it 1,200? 1,200?
[326:33.40]What's wrong with this song?
[326:36.81]I'm just skipping.
[326:38.25]Like it was a CD.
[326:40.41]Why is it doing that?
[326:41.05]It's a 1080 nozzle.
[327:01.72]I got a 3090 now, man.
[327:20.56]Nice flex.
[327:21.94]No, see what happened was I was forced to buy one because graphics cards didn't exist.
[327:27.68]And me and Community Jake were both desperately in all these different places trying to find a graphics card.
[327:36.75]Because remember eight months ago when I wanted to build a new computer?
[327:42.05]So I didn't want a 3090, but I got a 3090 because that was all that was available.
[327:55.91]And I'll tell you, this thing is hot.
[328:01.81]This thing runs way hotter than my 1080.
[328:06.37]So now I get computer room syndrome.
[328:11.09]Which means it just gets so hot in here because I have this monster 3090 in here generating a furnace level of heat.
[328:25.76]What's the average temp on it?
[328:27.96]It's really high.
[328:29.06]I'm going to have to do something about it.
[328:30.32]It's way too high.
[328:33.04]I think it hits like 90 Celsius.
[328:37.92]95, 92 all the time.
[328:43.97]I think it peaks at like 100.
[328:44.87]Underclock it.
[328:48.99]It's not overclocked.
[328:50.27]It's just regular clock speed.
[328:54.30]Yeah, these things just run insanely hot.
[328:56.08]I looked it up.
[328:58.50]I might have to get a cooler for this thing in particular.
[329:07.34]Underclock it.
[329:09.60]Why would I want to do that?
[329:17.17]Memory runs warm, probably referring to that.
[329:20.15]Micron posted actual specs recently.
[329:22.67]Max 105 Celsius under load.
[329:25.59]That seems so hot.
[329:27.05]That seems like it shouldn't be like that.
[329:30.92]That's more than boiling water, isn't it?
[329:33.32]That's like 200 something degrees.
[329:50.34]Get a water cooler.
[329:53.64]Yeah, I'm gonna have to do something.
[329:55.63]I really don't want one of those big elaborate tube systems, though.
[329:59.83]I can just get a GPU cooler and replace the stock fans on it, right?
[330:04.13]That'll probably be fine.
[330:15.06]Get an AIO.
[330:17.18]AIO, okay.
[330:18.70]What's an AIO?
[330:44.75]This whole thing under here.
[330:45.73]The PC will be cooler, but your room will be just as hot.
[330:50.78]Yeah.
[330:51.14]Do they make AC units for the back of a computer?
[331:00.02]I think they do.
[331:01.00]They're probably so stupid expensive, though.
[331:10.03]Oh, the geek squad.
[331:20.58]Stick it in the fridge.
[331:22.60]Just get a mini fridge, put the computer in the mini fridge.
[331:26.66]And have the power cord be coming out of like a hole I drilled.
[331:29.44]Would that work?
[331:32.26]What would that do?
[331:32.78]That would work, right?
[331:45.35]There's a Linus Tech Tips video on that.
[331:47.26]That's funny.
[331:48.40]I'll have to watch that later.
[332:00.61]73%, alright, getting there.
[332:13.46]Can you power wash your balls?
[332:16.86]Well, if you did that, I think you'd be at the hospital.
[332:20.86]That would be a bad idea.
[332:26.00]think that would be a major, major mistake.
[332:28.61]I would not ever, ever do something like that.
[332:30.69]Sounds very dangerous and very stupid.
[333:04.90]God.
[333:05.28]74.
[333:12.80]This one should be way more than 400 bucks.
[333:15.02]Should be way more.
[333:18.18]This is so much more time.
[333:19.06]This is so much more work.
[333:35.05]GPU hot tub?
[333:40.45]If you dropped a GPU into oil or something, right?
[333:46.64]What are those computers I see sometimes where all the parts are just in oil?
[333:53.26]It's like an oil-cooled PC or something.
[333:55.04]It's weird.
[333:55.78]Mineral oil.
[333:56.52]Does that work?
[334:08.09]Deep fried PC.
[334:10.37]I saw videos on it before.
[334:13.16]Where the entire computer is just submerged in mineral oil, right?
[334:21.32]There's a lot of downsides to it, but it does sort of work, huh?
[334:31.01]Well, I mean, problem number one is I really don't want to fry it later.
[334:35.56]sitting in my room just ready to tip over oh what do I want to eat I just thought of like fried chicken somebody said KFC maybe like Taco Bell or something
[335:01.41]Three cheesy gordita crunches with the Doritos, Locos, Tacos.
[335:04.20]Yep.
[335:05.26]I think that sounds like a great idea to me.
[335:06.84]That's the best thing there.
[335:22.74]Ugh.
[335:30.11]Bean burrito?
[335:33.84]The Cheesy Godita Crunch really might be the single most brilliant fast food invention.
[335:40.84]It really is.
[335:41.54]I think it is like the best fast food item.
[335:44.04]Where did I put it on the tier list?
[335:46.40]I put it up real high, didn't I?
[335:47.96]Where was it?
[335:57.65]Was it A?
[335:58.15]Was it S?
[335:58.71]Was it A or B?
[335:59.41]It was somewhere higher.
[336:00.07]Was it A?
[336:03.56]Why did I put an S tier for fast food stuff?
[336:13.75]Jerma985 meal?
[336:15.33]At Taco Bell, it's three cheese and gordita crunches with Doritos tacos, and that's it.
[336:19.19]You just get a drink.
[336:21.07]That's it.
[336:21.79]You don't get anything else.
[336:38.09]Not even the cinnamon things?
[336:39.51]No.
[336:40.07]No, I just want... I... I'm trying to really think the last time I ordered something else off the Taco Bell menu that was not that.
[336:50.34]I don't think I ever have.
[336:52.85]Well, before the Cheesy Gordita Crunch came out, I ordered tacos, the Mexican pizza they had there, chalupa, whatever.
[337:01.23]After Cheesy Gordita Crunch, every single order was Cheesy Gordita Crunch.
[337:06.02]I've never ordered anything else off of that menu since 1998, whenever it was.
[337:23.14]It's so good.
[337:23.68]It really is.
[337:27.62]It is so good.
[337:29.40]Oh, I'm getting it.
[337:30.25]I want it right now.
[337:35.17]What's your opinion on the Crunch Wrap Supreme?
[337:38.03]It's not the cheesy gordita crunch, so I will never order it, and I will never eat it.
[337:42.35]I've never had it, and I never will.
[337:45.70]There's no other reason.
[337:46.40]There's no reason for me to order it.
[337:47.64]Alright, if Taco Bell pulls...
[337:52.36]fast one here, and they've removed that off the menu?
[337:56.58]I'm not sure I would ever go there again.
[337:58.48]I really don't think so.
[337:59.30]There's no reason for me to be there.
[338:01.94]I go to Taco Bell for the Cheesy Godita Crunch.
[338:06.55]If it's not there, I'm not going.
[338:08.41]Fuck you, Jerma.
[338:19.98]The Crunchwrap is a staple.
[338:23.50]I'm sure it's good.
[338:25.18]It doesn't matter.
[338:25.78]I'm never gonna order something that's not the cheesy gordita crunch.
[338:28.74]It's never gonna happen.
[338:31.18]Because you could say, well, dude, you get three cheesy gordita crunches.
[338:33.77]Just order two and get a crunch wrap.
[338:36.45]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[338:37.17]Excuse me.
[338:37.53]No, thank you.
[338:39.33]That's one full cheesy gordita crunch I will not be able to enjoy.
[338:42.35]I want the full satisfaction.
[338:48.88]I will take a bite of the Crunchwrap Supreme and be sitting there going, I wish this was a Cheesy Godita Crunch.
[338:57.38]Why did I order it?
[339:07.45]I wish they would make more Cheesy Godita Crunch variants.
[339:14.45]They just have the normal one and then they have the Doritos one.
[339:19.47]Make some different ones.
[339:23.13]You're a cheesy Gordita dunce.
[339:31.43]That was pretty good.
[339:46.34]This place is so... How can dirt be in every single area?
[339:52.19]What even is 864p?
[339:53.67]Don't click it, man.
[339:56.29]It was a part of a prank video I'm doing.
[339:58.96]We just finished the shoot, and I don't want anyone else to click on it.
[340:01.54]Just be careful.
[340:02.30]Don't click it.
[340:11.74]If you want to know, it's a resolution that's divisible by 8.
[340:14.44]Therefore, it is true 16 by 9.
[340:16.70]If you don't have a resolution that's divisible by 8, then the program has to do extra work for pixels that don't exist.
[340:25.78]That's it.
[340:29.82]See, I'm smart.
[340:30.48]I know things.
[340:53.00]I mean, I want to up my bitrate, but I don't think I can.
[340:55.71]I think there's a cap on what you're allowed to actually do for a bitrate.
[341:02.57]That was a huge frog burp, and I hope nobody heard it.
[341:06.33]Yeah, 6k, yeah.
[341:14.11]To have anything over 720 not look like ass at 60 FPS, that's got to be at least 8,000.
[341:24.69]8, 9, 10,000.
[341:25.01]You can do 1080p 30 and it will look probably fine.
[341:32.54]Either that or you have to have such a monster CPU that you can drop the preset down to like slow or slowest and then you don't need the bitrate.
[341:48.05]But I don't have a CPU that can do that.
[341:52.15]I haven't really tried though.
[342:00.59]What OST is this?
[342:01.39]This is pretty good.
[342:02.89]I forgot what it was.
[342:09.39]What's my CPU?
[342:10.05]My CPU is... I actually forget.
[342:12.06]It's a new computer.
[342:14.70]Oh, my CPU is... A Ryzen 7 5800X 8-core.
[342:19.68]So it's a 5800X Ryzen 7 8-core.
[342:44.93]Irma has 30 webcams, but not two PCs.
[342:50.54]Well, the 30 webcams stream, the problem was all the bus lanes.
[342:54.98]There's only a certain amount of lanes on a motherboard where you can plug in, like, webcam.
[342:58.70]But there's a solution for it.
[343:02.67]Actually, Community Jake and I have been talking about that one.
[343:06.43]And the solution for it is something we can do.
[343:08.67]Maybe it would be fun to do.
[343:09.83]I donated all the webcams.
[343:14.70]I had, like, 30 webcams.
[343:16.62]Like, I had, like, at least 20, 15.
[343:18.06]I just donated them.
[343:20.38]I couldn't even use them.
[343:22.20]I'm never gonna be able to use them.
[343:30.12]Did you sign them?
[343:31.00]No.
[343:31.24]Why would I sign them?
[343:34.61]30, 20, 15, yeah, whatever.
[343:36.13]Buff, puke, whatever.
[343:44.32]A sidekick.
[343:45.97]Puke.
[344:00.95]Oh, we have horrible news.
[344:02.05]Pete of the Hut ate himself in his car.
[344:04.89]He was locked in his car.
[344:06.03]What's that from Spaceballs?
[344:12.75]Oh, that's a good movie.
[344:23.72]He had to eat himself because he locked himself in his car.
[344:30.08]I keep overlooking that from that movie.
[344:31.70]That guy literally ate himself and died.
[344:33.77]How do you eat yourself?
[344:48.99]Well, he was a pizza.
[344:51.19]If you didn't see Spaceballs, Pizza the Hutt is a character who is just a slice of pizza.
[344:54.61]And he's disgusting.
[344:56.79]It's gross.
[344:58.43]There's like cheese falling off of him and pepperonis and shit.
[345:00.86]It's really odd.
[345:01.74]He's a really fucking crazy character.
[345:17.07]The king of the Schwartz!
[345:21.12]See you next time for Spaceballs 2, the search for more money.
[345:35.78]That's classic Mel Brooks, man.
[345:51.87]There's not, I don't think there's very much Mel Brooks did that I didn't like.
[346:07.49]Rick Moranis.
[346:11.61]He was so good in that movie too.
[346:15.25]What the hell am I looking at?
[346:22.17]There's a lot of new people here, but that's my favorite gag ever.
[346:26.41]If you want to know what my all-time favorite joke ever in any piece of media ever.
[346:33.09]Comedy, stand-up, movies, TV shows, video games.
[346:36.47]It's that scene from Spaceballs where they have to put the Spaceballs movie into the fucking video player to find out what they have to do next.
[346:46.82]That's the best joke I've ever seen.
[346:51.37]Nothing even comes close.
[346:52.45]Not even close.
[347:01.79]Oh, fast forward this part.
[347:03.67]Yeah, I guess it's like the embarrassing part where he like falls and like hits his head.
[347:06.59]And he's like, fast forward this part.
[347:09.03]In fact, never play this again.
[347:10.87]Then they go too far and they get to the point where they're actually in the same part of the movie.
[347:17.77]Of them standing there looking at the screen.
[347:21.80]It's like, what is this?
[347:22.95]And he's like, oh, it's now, sir.
[347:24.21]We're watching now.
[347:24.99]How does this make any sense?
[347:27.27]This can't be.
[347:27.92]Hey, if you've never seen Spaceballs, that's required reading for this stream.
[347:50.39]What's the syllabus?
[347:51.65]I could give you guys the syllabus.
[347:54.35]That actually is funny to me.
[347:56.23]Should I make a syllabus for you guys?
[347:58.39]Of things you have to watch before watching this stream?
[348:08.16]I like that.
[348:08.70]That's actually kind of funny.
[348:09.58]85%.
[348:10.26]Alright, come on.
[348:15.96]Let's go.
[348:23.40]God damn it.
[348:28.64]The syllabus, by the way, has nothing to do with any of my content.
[348:33.20]You don't have to go watch any of my videos.
[348:35.82]Just go watch Spaceballs three times.
[348:40.15]Watch Ghostbusters 1, Ghostbusters 2, Gremlins 2.
[348:43.51]Gremlins 1 is good, but Gremlins 2 is better.
[348:48.67]I can make the whole syllabus for you.
[349:02.84]all the shpee videos no don't do that gremlins 2 is also one of the most important movies of my entire life so yeah I would say that that is huge too
[349:30.47]Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
[349:31.51]That's another one that's incredibly important required reading.
[349:43.96]That's embarrassing?
[349:45.04]Who Framed Roger Rabbit is embarrassing?
[349:48.73]That's in the Library of Congress.
[349:51.67]Cars 2 is in the Library of Congress.
[349:52.91]It doesn't matter.
[350:09.79]86%.
[350:09.83]What's something that I have not done at all?
[350:11.51]Oh, down here.
[350:20.95]What about Robocop?
[350:22.90]Robocop is good.
[350:24.18]But I wouldn't put that in my required reading list.
[350:32.94]Gorillas, Demon Days, and Plastic Beach.
[350:35.31]Also required reading.
[350:46.06]Hmm, what else is in there?
[350:52.84]And Plastic Beach?
[350:53.64]Yeah, I've really liked Plastic Beach a lot.
[350:56.78]A lot.
[350:57.10]I thought it was fantastic.
[351:01.00]A lot of people might not agree with that, but I think that's... It's really easy to say Demon Days is the best album, but I think Plastic Beach is.
[351:10.05]I know.
[351:10.61]People are going to be like, no fucking way.
[351:11.95]But I just really... Replayability, re-listenability...
[351:16.39]I've listened to Plastic Beach's songs more than I have Demon Days.
[351:21.75]And Demon Days is just a rock solid.
[351:25.93]Just absolute banger after banger.
[351:29.70]But for some reason, Plastic Beach just did it more for me.
[351:31.70]I don't know why.
[351:52.40]89.
[351:52.62]I mean, I think that arrow.
[351:57.64]Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the gorillas.
[351:59.85]I think that's the best.
[352:00.89]That's when they were at their absolute peak.
[352:04.27]That's not to say that I didn't like humans.
[352:13.12]But, Plastic Beach and Demon Days are way better.
[352:22.07]Song Machine is good, too.
[352:23.03]I actually haven't really given it much listen.
[352:26.05]I'll have to do that.
[352:34.03]I liked that single they came out with.
[352:35.52]What was it called?
[352:37.44]Humility?
[352:37.88]The one that says, Reset myself and get back on track.
[352:46.50]I like that song.
[352:48.16]I don't want this...
[352:51.25]See the state I'm in now.
[352:53.22]That was really good.
[353:00.22]That's from the Now Now.
[353:17.82]I actually, people were really mixed on Saturn bars.
[353:20.50]I really liked it.
[353:24.70]I thought it was really good.
[353:49.39]91%.
[353:49.41]This one is the longest out of all of them.
[353:55.60]I like moments was good too.
[353:56.78]Moments was just all of it.
[353:58.28]It was just super.
[353:59.92]Like when you put moments on it, it was just like my whole body would just move.
[354:21.58]I'm so happy De La Soul continued to do stuff with gorillas.
[354:24.42]They're so good.
[354:29.49]A lot of times, like, the gorillas will have that one-off.
[354:32.05]Where it's like, oh yeah, they were on that gorillas album that one time.
[354:34.21]But De La Soul is just on every album.
[354:38.13]Oh.
[354:39.35]I love it.
[354:50.86]Alright, what am I missing?
[354:51.94]There's a lot of places I'm missing.
[354:52.96]Where is it?
[354:55.22]Trash.
[354:55.54]Trash.
[354:59.85]Lou Reed collab with him too.
[355:01.03]Yeah, what was the Lou Reed song?
[355:03.51]I forget what it was.
[355:04.09]It was in Plastic Beach, right?
[355:11.42]Yeah, it was Plastic Beach.
[355:14.58]Oh yeah, some kind of nature.
[355:15.78]That's right.
[355:22.60]I love Stylo too though.
[355:24.08]Stylo was awesome.
[355:28.51]That was a driving song.
[355:29.65]It really was.
[355:54.74]Bruce Willis video was rad.
[355:56.08]Yeah, it was.
[356:08.60]Now you make me want to listen to the gorillas.
[356:10.00]I'll have to do that with my cheesy gordita crunch.
[356:12.76]Is this already clean?
[356:23.21]Kind of.
[356:28.32]Different nozzle, that's the problem.
[356:31.32]There it is.
[356:31.70]It sounds like the Doctor House song.
[356:45.41]Is that song called?
[356:49.93]Teardrop, right?
[356:54.71]Can I play this for a second on stream?
[356:56.25]Are we allowed to enjoy anything in 2021?
[357:01.40]Am I allowed to make a reference to any media I've ever watched that I thought was cool to share with anybody?
[357:06.00]No?
[357:06.14]I have to lock myself in my fucking room, turn the lights off, close all the windows, put headphones on, and not tell anybody I ever listened to it?
[357:17.87]I would play it right now!
[357:18.83]What the fuck?
[357:20.11]Whatever.
[357:33.37]Oh, this is very dirty under here.
[357:39.23]This is a lot of fun.
[357:42.27]This is very therapeutic.
[357:46.40]If you're looking for a game that's just therapeutic, this is one of them.
[357:54.10]This is fun.
[357:54.82]I like this.
[358:01.62]This is early access.
[358:02.44]I wonder what they're going to put in the full game.
[358:03.98]I'm curious.
[358:13.28]It doesn't need to be anything else, right?
[358:15.08]It knows exactly what it is.
[358:16.26]And that's what it's going to give you.
[358:18.32]That's it.
[358:29.73]Almost 1k in the bank.
[358:30.75]Almost.
[358:41.29]Wait, this is genuinely a waste of life.
[358:43.81]Wait, what are you talking?
[358:44.95]What?
[358:48.25]What?
[358:51.60]I'm just spraying some walls, man.
[358:53.90]I'm just hanging out, man.
[359:00.10]Yeah, you can say that about anything.
[359:10.99]Why have you not played the Bugsnax OST?
[359:13.27]I don't think I can.
[359:13.93]I think that song is copyright, isn't it?
[359:15.51]It's a waste of life.
[359:34.70]What the fuck?
[359:35.68]Let's go with the big one.
[359:36.66]I think this is... Yeah, that's fine.
[359:38.24]Okay, well, there it goes.
[359:46.88]IRL power washing stream when?
[359:49.06]I'll keep it in the head.
[359:50.91]I'll keep it up here.
[359:53.39]You might see it eventually.
[359:54.23]I think that'd be fun.
[359:55.65]Almost done.
[360:15.60]Man, this is a pain in the ass.
[360:16.54]This one doesn't want to go.
[360:17.28]I've got to get the other side.
[360:20.26]How am I going to get that?
[360:33.26]Are we going to get into through the ages stream?
[360:36.84]I don't know.
[360:37.32]That was kind of fun for a little while.
[360:40.49]Maybe.
[360:41.43]That was pretty fun.
[360:42.17]Maybe we should do that.
[360:48.37]There's a lot more people here now than were here before.
[360:50.91]Uh, I'll give you some context, those that don't know what we're talking about.
[360:54.94]So Through the Ages stream was, uh, there was a website that was made.
[360:58.00]That pulled every single stream I've ever done, every single video I've ever uploaded.
[361:03.44]And it picked a random timestamp, uh, randomly across one of those places.
[361:09.93]So it randomly picked the video, and then randomly picked the timestamp.
[361:15.21]And the idea was we were supposed to see what we got.
[361:23.48]I did it with channel points.
[361:24.30]I don't think I'll even do it with channel points this time.
[361:26.07]It'll probably just be like five minutes.
[361:29.13]Just five minutes or ten minutes, it just switches automatically.
[361:31.65]I gotta get up.
[361:36.92]Is there a ladder?
[361:43.70]What about another royalty-free movie night?
[361:47.75]Yeah, I'd want to make sure that the movies were good and not just... Because the movies we watched were funny.
[361:52.42]I want another... Is there any more Ritz Brothers movies?
[361:56.22]That's all I care about.
[361:56.98]Yeah, it can't be Bionicle.
[362:04.04]I looked into it.
[362:06.04]That's like a copywritten movie.
[362:07.34]I can't broadcast that.
[362:09.32]Even if it's free on the internet, I don't have the rights to broadcast it.
[362:14.53]I need something that there are no rights holders.
[362:17.75]There are still people that own the rights to all the media around Bionicle.
[362:23.73]I can't stream it.
[362:38.97]Do it anyways.
[362:39.69]Oh, okay.
[362:40.25]Alright, well, I'll see you when the channel gets deleted.
[362:42.77]It was a good run.
[362:43.25]Should I throw it all away for Bionicle?
[362:46.62]What do you think?
[362:48.56]That'd be kind of a hilarious last stream ever.
[363:02.42]That would be lame as hell if that was my final stream.
[363:11.44]I mean, it kind of would be.
[363:22.31]What if you did it with Joe Biden?
[363:24.25]They wouldn't be able to do anything about the president.
[363:30.47]I'm not going to...
[363:40.24]Just make a movie and watch it.
[363:41.96]I mean, I made a thousand YouTube videos.
[363:48.51]We've watched a bunch of those already.
[364:04.96]When is Otto's Pogtastic Adventure?
[364:08.16]I don't know.
[364:08.50]I have to make it.
[364:21.11]Remember videos, ResidentSleeper.
[364:24.09]Everybody's entitled to their opinion.
[364:26.21]You can have that.
[364:26.69]You can think my shit sucks if you want.
[364:28.65]That's fine.
[364:30.23]I'm not going to combat you on that.
[364:32.72]You are free to have an opinion, which you have.
[364:37.56]I can't change that.
[364:38.48]All I can do is say thanks for watching.
[364:40.14]Thanks for coming here.
[364:40.76]Thanks for spending your day here.
[364:53.97]I was going to scream.
[364:54.79]I was going to just scream like, get the fuck out of here.
[364:57.61]I was going to scream it.
[364:59.20]My voice is already kind of fucked up.
[365:03.24]And I thought it might have scared a bunch of people.
[365:05.58]So I didn't do it.
[365:06.18]Some people are probably actually lying down right now and I don't want to scream in their ear.
[365:32.78]I gotta move the ladder.
[365:33.76]Wait, no I don't.
[365:34.34]Can I just get up here?
[365:45.67]Some people will probably get sleep.
[365:46.67]Should we like fuck with their dreams?
[366:00.46]How do we do that?
[366:01.00]Like, just talk about how they're asleep right now?
[366:06.31]You're asleep right now.
[366:08.49]You sleeping right now.
[366:09.85]I know you're asleep.
[366:12.57]Wake up for a sec.
[366:14.09]Look around you.
[366:15.77]This is a dream.
[366:16.33]Don't worry.
[366:16.67]This is a dream.
[366:18.37]It's me, Jerma, talking to you.
[366:20.73]Sleeping.
[366:24.52]Make sure you take the trash out.
[366:30.42]Go back to bed now.
[366:31.25]I don't have anything funny to say.
[366:33.71]I thought I might have something funny to say, but I didn't come up with anything quick enough.
[366:37.55]So I told you to do a small chore.
[366:41.11]Now go back to bed.
[366:42.69]This is a dream.
[366:43.39]This is a dream.
[366:43.83]Don't worry.
[366:44.19]You're fine.
[366:44.70]This is a dream.
[366:46.20]20,455. 20,460.
[367:01.17]20,466.
[367:01.19]20,600.
[367:02.01]Oh, get me off.
[367:09.34]I can't take it.
[367:13.98]That's not a prime number.
[367:15.31]Whatever.
[367:15.65]I don't know.
[367:16.21]I don't know prime numbers.
[367:26.75]Put on forest sound effects.
[367:28.01]Make them think they're in the woods.
[367:29.61]Put an ocean sound effect.
[367:31.28]Hey, you're asleep right now.
[367:32.28]And you're in the ocean.
[367:33.10]Alright, yeah.
[367:33.50]Let's make somebody think they're in the ocean.
[367:44.88]Hey there.
[367:47.59]It's me, Jerma985.
[367:49.89]On the beach with you.
[367:52.51]This is a dream.
[367:53.03]Don't worry.
[367:53.37]Don't get up.
[367:54.93]Just take in the salty air.
[367:58.25]You're the seagulls.
[368:02.61]Ah, it's so fresh out here, don't you think?
[368:08.00]What I want you to do is I want you to let go of anything negative that you're thinking of.
[368:15.16]Just the waves.
[368:17.14]And you and me here.
[368:20.92]When you awake from your sleep, don't get up, don't get up, it's okay.
[368:26.46]You're going to go to twitch.tv.
[368:31.16]Slash Jerma985.
[368:32.10]If you're not already, which you have to be.
[368:35.06]Because you're here with me in a dream.
[368:38.84]And you're going to... I was going to say sub to me and shit, but I don't want to do that.
[368:54.55]It's still a dream.
[368:55.59]You're still in a dream.
[368:58.89]Look at the boat go by.
[369:00.93]Wow.
[369:02.75]Watch the seagulls.
[369:04.55]Look above you.
[369:05.05]They just flew up.
[369:06.83]One shit in my mouth.
[369:13.27]What the fuck?
[369:22.83]Don't get up right now.
[369:23.33]You're still in a dream.
[369:26.14]When you rise, I want you to just have a new clean day, clear day.
[369:33.14]Clear your head after this.
[369:34.02]You're going to watch Jerma's streams.
[369:40.13]He's so good.
[369:41.15]He's so funny.
[369:42.49]He's like the funniest guy on Twitch.
[369:45.57]And continue to watch.
[369:46.71]He's like your favorite.
[369:50.59]Let's hear the waves in my voice.
[369:55.12]I snap my fingers, you're going to wake up.
[369:58.48]And you're going to act like a chicken.
[369:59.60]And the audience is going to laugh.
[370:04.82]In three, two, one.
[370:07.13]You're up.
[370:09.15]You're up.
[370:19.39]I don't know, man.
[370:20.55]I was going to do like the sub thing, but like I got caught halfway through and I just, it felt really ugly and I didn't want to do it.
[370:38.19]Fuck, fuck.
[370:40.91]Oh, everybody's laughing.
[370:42.03]I can't believe it.
[370:43.75]He's doing a chicken.
[370:45.17]He's doing a chicken noise.
[370:51.77]Statistically, you have at least one celebrity fan.
[370:54.16]Who do you think it is?
[370:59.02]It's you.
[371:00.16]So, I gotta figure out who you are.
[371:01.40]Um, because that's... You are literally the celebrity in your underwear watching the stream right now.
[371:08.71]And you asked me that question, so I wonder who you are.
[371:11.73]I'm gonna say... Hmm...
[371:22.42]Who would word it like that?
[371:23.34]Uh, I'm gonna, um, hmm.
[371:36.91]The Grinch?
[371:37.43]The Grinch is not a person.
[371:39.69]It's a character that an actor plays.
[371:41.25]It's not Vin Diesel.
[371:46.83]No, it's not.
[371:48.09]Um, no.
[371:48.93]Who is it then?
[371:56.64]I don't know.
[371:57.12]Who is that?
[372:00.30]Yeah, you know what?
[372:00.74]It's probably like a senator or something.
[372:02.54]It's probably like a congressman.
[372:05.26]Or like a congresswoman or something.
[372:15.84]It's probably like a congressman that you would not expect.
[372:28.15]Dave State.
[372:30.69]It's Mitch McConnell.
[372:36.64]I was asleep during Jerma985's stream.
[372:41.88]And he was very, very kind to me.
[372:45.02]And he told me to be the best I can.
[372:54.01]So what I've decided is I've decided that there will be no more stimulus.
[373:00.31]We don't need another stimulus.
[373:05.98]I've decided to stimulate Jerma's bank account by providing $200 million to his bank account.
[373:16.66]All in favor of that stimulus, say aye.
[373:32.78]That's not even how it works.
[373:33.66]Don't you have to vote?
[373:51.79]Mitch McConnell.
[373:56.33]Guys, I don't think it's Mitch McConnell.
[373:57.81]I think Mitch McConnell still has trouble opening up web browsers.
[374:04.20]I think Mitch McConnell still needs to call his son.
[374:09.70]To ask him how, uh, like, Microsoft Network still works.
[374:14.14]Like, yeah, I would feel like he has, like, an MSN account, don't you?
[374:32.51]Mitch McConnell's the kind of guy that has, like, an at AOL email.
[374:35.27]Alright, what's left?
[374:52.27]Okay, the monkey bars, stools, the bin.
[374:56.71]What bin?
[374:57.97]The trash bin?
[375:03.01]What's wrong with this?
[375:03.47]Is it the back?
[375:07.85]Oh shit, it's up there.
[375:17.20]This place looks pretty good.
[375:18.04]I can't wait to see the time lapse.
[375:29.22]There's a second bin?
[375:30.34]Hmm, I'll go look.
[375:40.59]And by the way, what level of celebrity are you guys talking about?
[375:42.73]Are you talking about an A-list celebrity?
[375:44.85]Or are you talking about a person of interest or something?
[375:50.96]Like an A-list celeb- I don't know if any A-list celebrities watch this stream.
[376:03.52]You think it's Tom Holland?
[376:05.82]I don't think so.
[376:08.02]I don't know, it might be.
[376:12.32]Imagine ever meeting somebody at Comic Con or something.
[376:15.20]Oh, yeah, at the autograph signing or something.
[376:19.99]It's like, oh, hey, Mitch McConnell.
[376:23.59]Oh, Mitch McConnell.
[376:24.53]Wow, I can't believe you're here at Comic Con.
[376:27.53]Yeah, I'm here.
[376:28.93]I mean, I may as well be in a rubber mask.
[376:31.72]I might be a scary monster, but, you know, I'm here.
[376:36.44]I may as well be a scary guy.
[376:41.84]So, Tom Holland.
[376:44.44]I fucked up the whole thing.
[376:46.25]Going up to Tom Holland at Comic-Con or something and getting something signed.
[376:50.79]And then being like, oh, here you go.
[376:52.53]What's your name?
[376:54.33]Jeremy.
[376:54.89]Jeremy.
[376:55.91]Jeremy.
[376:56.71]Oh, yeah.
[376:57.03]And he leans in and just whispers into my ear.
[377:00.13]I love that Mitch McConnell voice.
[377:01.29]What would I do?
[377:13.63]I love that Mitch McConnell voice you do.
[377:16.32]Hang out with me!
[377:17.36]Should I scream that?
[377:34.15]What's left?
[377:34.57]Oh, over there.
[377:35.01]Okay.
[377:44.02]I'd be like, oh, Spider-Man's my favorite character.
[377:45.72]Spider-Man's my favorite character.
[377:46.86]I love Spider-Man.
[377:47.72]Spider-Man's my favorite character.
[377:48.85]And he'd go, alright, man.
[377:53.19]And I'd be like, it's me, Mitch McConnell.
[377:56.07]I can't do it.
[377:56.49]Hold on.
[377:57.59]I can't.
[377:58.25]He liked it, though.
[377:59.39]I love Spider-Man.
[378:02.95]I would have to do his favorite character in front of him.
[378:12.49]I would get it so wrong.
[378:13.33]I would be so choked up like this.
[378:14.53]I wouldn't be able to do anything.
[378:17.17]But I would have to do another character instead.
[378:18.67]I'd be like, you like Mitch McConnell, but I'll give you another one.
[378:21.17]Here's Spongebob.
[378:26.14]And security just grabs me.
[378:34.16]And then somebody a week later comes in with a username.
[378:38.60]Nice Spongebob, LOL.
[378:40.26]Nice Spongebob impression, LOL.
[378:41.78]And I know it's him.
[378:44.09]That's their username.
[378:55.28]Oh, it's inside.
[378:56.26]This is a huge fanfiction.
[379:00.89]No, it's not.
[379:02.73]This is not real.
[379:03.43]This is just make-believe nothing.
[379:15.41]Self-insert fanfic.
[379:16.63]Yeah, I know.
[379:17.95]Whatever.
[379:20.24]What's not clean?
[379:22.98]Stools.
[379:26.38]What else?
[379:28.05]The bars.
[379:44.39]Guys, the only factual thing you've heard me say in this stream so far is the cheesy gojita crunch is the best item at Taco Bell.
[379:52.68]And that we need to redo our education system.
[379:54.78]Those are the only two things I've said that are real.
[379:59.22]What is left?
[380:05.27]The bench.
[380:10.41]Which one?
[380:10.81]Underneath?
[380:13.96]This one?
[380:15.50]No, it's the other one, right?
[380:22.92]What about when you said you never pooed your diaper?
[380:25.17]I did, probably a lot.
[380:27.33]I did probably all the time.
[380:29.03]When I was one.
[380:29.61]A lot of you guys don't want to hear this, but you probably have filled, you yourself, you listening to this right now, have filled probably 2,000 to 3,000 diapers of shit.
[380:41.83]You don't want to hear that, though.
[380:42.89]But you did.
[381:05.30]What do you mean question marks?
[381:10.18]Oh, almost there.
[381:10.84]I have 1160.
[381:15.98]Oh, cool.
[381:21.97]What about you throwing up orange juice on the floor?
[381:23.73]Yes, that was real.
[381:24.33]Golf cart.
[381:31.59]Let's be quick.
[381:37.83]This'll be really quick.
[381:39.05]Give me the big one.
[381:39.85]Give me the, uh, no, should I just spray?
[381:41.77]This should do it, yeah.
[381:45.53]This'll be quick.
[381:54.45]There we go, okay.
[382:06.23]I gotta get the other nozzle.
[382:10.97]Do you miss the whole stream because your Wi-Fi died?
[382:13.12]Oh, shit.
[382:14.44]I'm sorry.
[382:25.71]That mud.
[382:26.51]Get it.
[382:43.15]Who covered the cart in cheese?
[382:44.64]I think the actual question is who took the cart off-roading?
[382:57.94]Jackass.
[383:03.06]Johnny Knoxville.
[383:19.42]Maybe it's Johnny Knoxville.
[383:23.06]Could be.
[383:23.28]You gonna do more VR streams?
[383:33.75]I am gonna do more VR streams.
[383:35.53]That's coming up soon.
[383:36.59]I actually think I might be getting an index.
[383:45.83]Because the Vive is... I like my Vive, but I broke the controller.
[383:49.35]So I need to get the knuckle controllers anyways.
[383:51.49]I think I kind of want to upgrade.
[383:55.23]So I'll probably just... I'll probably donate the one I have now.
[383:59.82]Another one.
[384:00.16]Because I had the original Vive.
[384:12.88]Not the Vive Pro or the new one.
[384:14.35]I think that was the original Vive.
[384:15.81]I'll probably get an Index.
[384:31.00]Isn't there another one?
[384:31.60]What's it called?
[384:32.08]There's another one that's coming out too, isn't there?
[384:44.33]Oh wait, 1250?
[385:00.31]Well, alright, I have enough.
[385:09.28]The Oculus Quest 2 is good, but requires Facebook.
[385:13.29]The reverb G2 is supposedly really good too.
[385:17.43]I'll probably just get the index.
[385:18.55]I feel like that's the one to get if you were going to get one.
[385:22.47]Alright, medium duty.
[385:23.43]Here we go.
[385:25.38]Surface more, more, more.
[385:27.14]Oily ingrained.
[385:28.48]What's that do?
[385:31.20]Get it.
[385:33.12]Alright, so now I already got the attachments for it, right?
[385:39.39]So now I got this detached house.
[385:43.92]place is huge reverb g2 is great when wmr decides to work properly index is a good buy if you're just going to do stream stuff okay alright so where where's my where's my new nozzle I just bought it where is it is there one of these ones here
[386:19.76]Medium duty, the Urban X-U2.
[386:25.24]I own the attachment.
[386:25.98]Where is it?
[386:26.68]I didn't equip it.
[386:27.31]How do I equip it?
[386:31.65]Oh, E, okay.
[386:35.33]And we'll do the extension.
[386:39.85]Ooh.
[386:43.75]That's better.
[386:44.21]Alright, I think I should be able to do this now, right?
[386:59.18]Looks like a gas tank.
[387:07.48]It's not optimal.
[387:16.35]I like going side to side.
[387:17.29]It's much better for my brain.
[387:29.25]Yeah, what the fuck?
[387:36.40]This thing sucks.
[387:37.10]Can I just take it off?
[387:52.95]This thing sucks.
[387:56.49]Soap?
[387:57.37]Oh, shit.
[387:57.83]That's right.
[387:58.09]I should do soap.
[387:59.90]Oh, I don't have the soap nozzle.
[388:01.10]It's like 500 bucks.
[388:11.46]Even this, maybe this is just really dirty.
[388:40.78]Shoot closer.
[388:41.40]It's the distance.
[388:47.63]It is kind of distance, isn't it?
[388:48.77]Alright.
[388:49.15]Not bad.
[389:11.20]Nice.
[389:11.52]There we go.
[389:11.98]Looks better.
[389:12.88]Change the radio.
[389:34.00]Oh, what do we got?
[389:39.32]A boat.
[389:39.64]Alright, this is probably going to be the last thing we do.
[389:42.79]After this house, we'll probably call it.
[389:45.01]What's a... What's a good one?
[389:56.72]Ape escape?
[389:59.10]Oh, I like Plants vs. Zombies.
[390:00.06]That's a good one.
[390:03.26]That's a good one.
[390:05.28]Wabby wobble.
[390:06.88]Wobble wobble wobble wobble wobble.
[390:12.06]Alright, let's do it.
[390:16.38]We're zombies.
[390:17.18]We're coming.
[390:28.38]And if only they made the second game not a never-ending cash grab.
[390:37.29]Or PopCap.
[390:43.36]TopCap had so many cool games.
[390:44.64]Can you imagine not making an Insane Aquarium?
[390:48.96]Another one?
[390:51.98]Why won't they make another one?
[390:53.12]Why would they not have made... I would have rather taken the pay-to-win Insane Aquarium.
[391:05.49]They just leaned so heavy into Plants vs. Zombies.
[391:10.32]It made like five games of Plants vs. Zombies.
[391:12.72]It's like, give me something else.
[391:15.65]It's my favorite PS2 game.
[391:40.28]What is my favorite PS2 game?
[391:47.02]I don't know.
[391:51.37]Katamari?
[392:00.57]I don't think so.
[392:01.30]Favorite PS2 game?
[392:06.38]I don't remember a lot of PS2.
[392:07.84]I really don't.
[392:14.46]I can tell you my favorite N64 game was No Mercy.
[392:26.29]WWF No Mercy.
[392:27.31]That was probably my favorite game of that whole generation.
[392:55.03]This thing actually is much more powerful.
[392:56.53]I like it.
[392:56.87]Alright, that's that.
[393:05.65]Let's go back to this one.
[393:27.84]This is going a lot smoother.
[393:28.91]I'm already at 10%.
[393:34.01]It's going way smoother.
[393:35.11]When are you going to make a TikTok account?
[393:47.50]I'm not going to make a TikTok account.
[393:49.16]So, sorry.
[393:52.00]If you're anxiously anticipating a TikTok account, you're not going to get it.
[394:05.33]Already 10, 11%, holy shit.
[394:11.17]Oh, no TikTok.
[394:12.63]I'm not making any more accounts or any more platforms.
[394:16.36]I'll tell you, I got to be honest with everybody here.
[394:18.62]This is it.
[394:19.74]I ain't moving again.
[394:20.54]I went from YouTube to Twitch.
[394:24.22]I'm not going from Twitch to like TikTok or something.
[394:27.02]No, this is it.
[394:37.79]This is where the story ends.
[394:53.38]I gotta get the ladder for that one.
[394:57.22]Oh, that's caked on there.
[394:58.12]Was that ink?
[395:05.13]That's really caked on there.
[395:06.21]Check this out.
[395:08.58]Oof, really caked on there.
[395:10.13]Let's just... There we go.
[395:11.11]Pen's dirty.
[395:30.36]I can't get up there.
[395:57.58]Good, good, very good, very good, very good.
[396:00.15]I like it.
[396:01.67]Give me the ding, come on.
[396:19.61]I need the ladder.
[396:19.99]Where's the ladder on this level?
[396:20.93]Why am I asking you?
[396:22.61]Like, you guys know.
[396:27.85]Alright, I need the... There we go, ladder.
[396:41.14]That's a pretty good spot.
[396:50.99]Eddie, fast forward.
[396:53.17]You can't.
[396:53.61]I'm sorry.
[396:58.51]You have to suffer through me playing a chores game.
[397:02.19]These are my favorite games.
[397:05.79]You know it.
[397:06.41]I know it.
[397:06.81]We all know it.
[397:14.93]There we go to the swirl.
[397:24.67]they actually make them that do this that's kind of cool so
[397:55.20]This is a big house.
[397:57.26]Thank God.
[398:02.28]The celebrity that watches him is Chuck E. Cheese.
[398:07.62]Ah, Chuck E. Cheese is not an A-list celebrity.
[398:12.37]Chuck E. Cheese is one of those people that they get to be on, like, one of the seasons of Survivor or something.
[398:18.63]You know what I mean?
[398:19.15]It's like, oh yeah, I remember you.
[398:32.03]He's famous, he's a celebrity, but he's not an A-list celebrity.
[398:37.15]No, no, no.
[398:40.00]I didn't say I hate Chuck E. Cheese.
[398:41.72]I just said he's not an A-list celebrity.
[398:43.52]I'm not an A-list celebrity.
[398:47.58]And look, Chuck E. Cheese is way more famous and popular than I am.
[398:51.20]He would get invited onto Survivor.
[398:52.86]I wouldn't.
[399:15.77]Who covered for you?
[399:16.77]What do you mean covered for me?
[399:17.87]What do you mean he covered for me?
[399:34.44]What did he cover me for?
[399:56.36]Fun fact, you can hear zombies on your lawn here.
[399:59.01]That is a pretty fun fact.
[400:00.59]Liar.
[400:10.73]Celebrity tier list?
[400:18.10]But what would that even mean?
[400:19.38]Like, who do I think is the coolest celebrity?
[400:38.61]Who's the most famous celebrity?
[400:44.67]It's probably Tom Hanks.
[400:46.35]Tom Hanks is S, I think.
[400:55.94]Brad Pitt?
[400:56.52]Yeah, S. It's Brad Pitt and Tom Hanks.
[401:09.91]Brad Pitt is absolutely an S tier.
[401:11.65]Don't even tell me that.
[401:13.15]Of course he is.
[401:13.73]Joe Biden.
[401:18.50]Joe Biden is a politician.
[401:47.57]If you're a politician, you're already a known person because you're a politician.
[401:51.03]We're talking about people that are, like, movie and TV show actors.
[402:07.83]Tom Cruise, yep.
[402:08.65]Gwyneth Paltrow?
[402:12.94]Uh, I don't know.
[402:14.36]Not so much really anymore, I don't think.
[402:16.30]No.
[402:22.81]Jennifer Aniston, I would put probably an S there.
[402:26.37]Yeah, Jennifer Aniston's probably S there.
[402:28.71]George Clooney.
[402:40.54]You're fooling Jennifer Aniston.
[402:42.14]What are you talking about?
[402:42.98]One of the most famous people ever.
[403:02.25]Where does Cathy Mitchell go though?
[403:08.09]I would be more happy and more starstruck meeting Cathy Mitchell than Jennifer Aniston.
[403:16.72]I'm serious.
[403:22.26]I would be nervous around Cathy Mitchell.
[403:42.00]Kids, I have a surprise for you.
[403:55.30]The following is a paid advertisement for the Express Ready, Set, Go!
[403:58.68]Brought to you by GT Direct, Louisville, Colorado.

[405:14.42]Just like millions of you, the Express 101 is always there for me.
[405:18.92]And I can't imagine improving on what's going on with my most used kitchen helper.
[405:23.48]But I've heard improvement is exactly what's happened.
[405:26.73]And there's only one person in the world who's qualified to let us in on the news.
[405:30.71]So let's join my friend Cathy Mitchell and discover what's happened to the easiest cooking appliance in my home.

[407:01.67]This first one I've got, it's kind of a giant cookie pizza.
[407:05.11]I would call it a cookie pizza.
[407:08.04]I call it a cookie pizza.
[407:08.88]This happens to be oatmeal chocolate chip.
[407:10.64]Anytime you need a quick dessert, I call it a cookie pizza.
[407:14.42]Just mix up your face.
[407:20.94]Cathy Mitchell is S tier.
[407:23.76]I would rather, I would pay a thousand dollars to like meet and greet Cathy Mitchell versus, I don't care about any other celebrity.
[407:44.42]Why?
[407:44.92]Because I, she's cool.
[407:56.72]And she's so good on camera too.
[407:58.42]She's so quick.
[407:59.13]She's so good on camera.
[408:01.75]You can't teach that.
[408:08.18]She's so natural in front of the camera.
[408:30.79]Can we pay you a thousand dollars to stop talking about the infomercial, lady?
[408:35.50]It's been five minutes!
[408:36.86]I've been- what are you- it's not even- I'll tell you, Cathy Mitchell was very, very comforting.
[408:58.85]I remember being... I don't care.
[409:00.50]I don't care.
[409:00.82]I'm talking about it.
[409:02.58]I remember a lot of these Cathy Mitchell infomercials would air at 1, 2, 3 o'clock in the morning.
[409:11.70]And this is back, I think, when I was in high school and college and stuff.
[409:14.36]It was so comforting to hear Cathy Mitchell's voice.
[409:18.27]I would just watch them.
[409:19.17]It was so nice.
[409:19.99]It was wonderful.
[409:20.71]Just having, like, falling asleep to it.
[409:47.63]Yeah, it was great.
[409:50.43]Anytime, whenever I was like half asleep and I'd be like, and now, coming up next, ready, set, go.
[409:55.25]I'd be like, hold on.
[409:56.97]She in this one?
[409:58.84]And if it wasn't, I'd be like, nah, I changed channel.
[410:01.28]But if it's like, and coming up here, we have our resident host, Cathy Mitchell.
[410:05.38]And I'd be like, put it on, turn the volume up higher.
[410:08.76]And now you have my attention.
[410:20.40]I'm honest.
[410:21.92]I probably really am Cathy Mitchell's number one fan.
[410:28.36]I don't think anyone else can say that.
[410:29.96]I think just me.
[410:35.03]I'm not crazy.
[410:36.41]I'm not crazy.
[410:37.85]No, I'm fucking fine.
[410:40.95]Everybody relax.
[410:42.69]What?
[410:42.83]I just think an infomercial lady's cool.
[410:44.61]What's wrong with that?
[410:54.34]Why is everybody treating me like I'm crazy?
[411:03.56]Shit!
[411:13.79]I can't even- alright, let's go.
[411:30.32]Oh, God!
[411:31.84]Whatever.
[411:32.12]I gotta get this hole to the side.
[411:47.72]This house is so dirty.
[412:09.43]Did a fucking volcano erupt on their house?
[412:31.01]No, this is from years of not cleaning the roof.
[412:38.60]Express 101.
[412:39.44]The Express Ready Set Go.
[412:48.66]The Snack Master.
[412:50.40]Cathy Mitchell's Dump Cakes.
[412:52.68]Cathy Mitchell's Dump Meals.
[412:55.20]Cathy Mitchell's Copper Pan.
[413:01.38]Cathy Mitchell's Square Pan.
[413:04.81]Cathy Mitchell's Turbo Cooker.
[413:08.91]I've seen them all.
[413:10.43]All of them.
[413:11.77]Many times over.
[413:29.57]How many did I buy?
[413:30.51]None of them.
[413:34.74]I think my family had the Snackmaster.
[413:36.52]I'm pretty sure they did.
[413:47.30]Fake fan?
[413:47.94]What are you talking about?
[413:57.77]What do you mean fake fan?
[414:00.47]I had the snack master!
[414:04.54]And I had the cop- I had the copper pan!
[414:07.22]Cathy Mitchell's copper pan, I had it.
[414:09.90]The only pan I had.
[414:29.00]Your family had it.
[414:30.34]What do you mean my family had it?
[414:32.26]I had the copper pan.
[414:38.57]I had the copper pan.
[414:39.75]I bought the copper pan.
[414:41.71]Like five years ago.
[414:42.81]Four or five years ago.
[414:51.94]Show it.
[414:52.30]I don't have the pan anymore.
[414:55.15]I stopped using it like six years ago or something.
[414:57.43]I bought it like five years ago.
[414:58.72]Oh wait, I got caught.
[414:59.86]Hold on.
[415:01.04]I bought this pan when I was still in Massachusetts.
[415:05.00]I did not bring the pan to Vegas.
[415:06.56]It was the copper pan.
[415:07.88]Cathy Mitchell's face was on it.
[415:14.80]It's not a lie.
[415:15.40]I'm not lying.
[415:15.92]I had the Cathy Mitchell copper pan.
[415:19.72]I only bought it because her name was on it.
[415:21.98]Her face was on it.
[415:42.76]Yes!
[415:44.26]30%, that's it.
[415:44.92]Oh, goodness.
[415:52.29]Buy another one right now.
[415:53.95]No, I don't need it.
[416:01.88]Actually, I kind of do, actually.
[416:04.16]I could use a new pan.
[416:06.88]Maybe I'll buy it.
[416:08.86]Maybe I'll get the Cathy Mitchell copper pan again.
[416:27.96]The big one.
[416:28.34]There we are.
[416:39.82]Buy it if you're a real fan.
[416:44.44]I'll probably get it.
[416:45.40]It was good.
[416:48.46]It actually worked.
[416:51.98]Buy the XL square copper pan.
[416:53.80]Yeah, that's the one.
[416:57.20]My square copper pan is better than all the others.
[416:58.99]Let me show you.
[416:59.89]I'm putting two tablespoons of teaspoons.
[417:02.59]I'm adding two cups of flour and a little bit of milk.
[417:06.86]My copper pan is better than all the other pans.
[417:08.78]Look at that steak.
[417:09.62]Yeah, I bought it.
[417:25.29]And they always put a piece of cheese in there.
[417:29.07]Why do they do that?
[417:31.99]They put one piece of cheddar cheese in the pan, and they cook the cheese.
[417:40.15]Who the fuck is cooking cheese in a pan?
[417:43.59]And as you see, I'm cooking cheese in this pan, and the cheese does not stick to the bottom!
[417:48.43]Why are you cooking a piece of cheese?
[417:54.30]to show the quality.
[418:00.69]That's the point.
[418:01.45]A grilled cheese.
[418:02.09]No, but you don't just put a slice of cheese in the pan.
[418:05.65]How many times has this happened to you?
[418:08.35]When you're cooking slices of cheese in your pan?
[418:13.94]To show it will not stick to the pan.
[418:18.52]To show it doesn't stick.
[418:24.41]I love when that guy says technology, too.
[418:27.35]With anti-stick technology.
[418:29.73]There's always a technology.
[418:31.61]With vacuum-sealed technology.
[418:36.14]The word technology in infomercials was the best way to make anybody over the age of 70 to pick the phone up and buy it.
[418:44.02]With true cooking technology.
[418:46.64]It's a convection oven.
[418:47.97]That's it.
[418:50.18]The super cooker cooks around all sides with our patented super turbo cooking technology.
[418:56.61]It's a convection oven.
[418:58.75]Done.
[419:01.63]Oh, technology.
[419:02.63]It's got, it's got technology in it.
[419:05.95]I'll call that number right now.
[419:18.83]Peaceful Haley.
[419:19.59]Oh, thanks for the 10 communities up.
[419:20.99]I think I missed a bunch of other subs too Thank you them Apparently also works on you also Look at it looks even better already
[419:54.38]You won't shut up about it.
[420:00.09]You doing E3 next week?
[420:01.11]I am.
[420:01.41]We're doing the Microsoft conference.
[420:04.99]So next time you're going to see my face is Saturday.
[420:07.09]At the Microsoft conference.
[420:10.55]Well, I won't be there, but I will be streaming it.
[420:12.23]We'll be giving our reactions to things.
[420:17.45]Wonder what they got in store for us this time.
[420:25.92]Yes, Saturday is a react Andy stream it is.
[420:38.15]Is Microsoft Sunday?
[420:39.05]I thought Microsoft Saturday.
[420:41.59]What is the Microsoft conference?
[420:42.53]Is it Saturday or Sunday?
[420:47.31]At like 10 AM Pacific, yeah.
[420:49.63]Sunday, OK, well, whenever the Microsoft one is, that's what I'm doing.
[421:04.14]No Nintendo?
[421:05.73]No, Nintendos are usually... They're always, like, on, like, a Tuesday or something.
[421:12.17]And they're always, like, 40 minutes long.
[421:13.87]And I really don't know what the hell to do afterwards.
[421:15.39]So, no.
[421:16.67]No Nintendo.
[421:28.40]And it's really early in the morning, too.
[421:29.76]Yeah, it's, like, 9... 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning.
[421:43.82]He hates Nintendo and Luigi.
[421:46.92]It's not true, but I have not played a Nintendo game all the way through since like Mario Galaxy.
[421:52.49]I mean, I guess you can count Mario Sunshine.
[421:59.89]But I haven't really played very many Nintendo games all the way through.
[422:02.60]It was the last Nintendo game I really played.
[422:06.54]Pikmin.
[422:07.00]Did I beat Pikmin?
[422:10.90]Did I complete Pikmin?
[422:15.17]No, I don't think I did, right?
[422:30.12]I got the first ending.
[422:31.38]Oh, well, I got like the, yeah, the ending, like the first part of the game.
[422:35.88]I saw an ending.
[422:40.65]Oh, that game was fucking terrible, by the way.
[422:43.79]I was holding in so much how much I hated that whole game.
[422:48.74]I wanted to scream so badly about how much I just despised playing it.
[422:54.26]I just held it in, though.
[422:55.98]Enough time has gone by, I can tell you.
[422:57.71]I'm kidding!
[423:00.89]Jesus!
[423:03.07]I'm kidding!
[423:03.93]Oh my god.
[423:20.43]I'm kidding.
[423:20.99]Don't worry.
[423:21.43]Oh, there's a lot of dirt still. 40%.
[423:51.23]I never went back to Hades.
[423:53.69]That was my game of the year, too.
[424:02.30]Yeah, actual game of the year, and I only played it for like seven and a half hours.
[424:06.13]Hey, look, I know exactly how good it is.
[424:12.65]I don't need to know anymore.
[424:24.07]Was it in Half-Life Alyx?
[424:25.39]Oh yeah, it was.
[424:25.93]That game was awesome.
[424:43.84]Half-Life Alyx was so good.
[424:57.23]It was truly a fantastic game.
[425:04.33]I underrated it?
[425:05.27]I did?
[425:06.92]Didn't I say it was the game of the year?
[425:17.77]What did I get for a rating?
[425:32.40]9.4?
[425:34.14]That's pretty good.
[425:38.55]Going higher than a 9.4, I mean, that's one of the best games I've ever played.
[425:49.81]Having a score over a 9 means that's one of the best games I've played.
[425:54.17]What else have I given a 9?
[425:54.89]In the last 5 years.
[426:09.32]Minecraft?
[426:11.26]Makes sense.
[426:14.76]Minecraft makes sense.
[426:31.49]House Flipper?
[426:32.05]That makes sense too.
[426:40.35]What game is a 10 out of 10?
[426:43.26]I don't know.
[426:43.80]GTA 4 is probably pretty high.
[426:54.88]Resident Evil 2 was really high, the remake.
[427:05.15]TF2 would be pretty close as well.
[427:09.84]Yeah, I don't know though.
[427:21.14]Bloodborne?
[427:21.74]Bloodborne needs to be 60 FPS.
[427:24.50]That's the one thing holding it back.
[427:38.13]I'm not sure I've ever played a perfect 10 out of 10.
[427:43.35]Team Fortress is close.
[427:46.89]It probably is TF2.
[427:51.91]I can't think of much else that deserves a 10.
[428:11.70]Chrono Trigger?
[428:13.48]Yeah, Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, those are all really good.
[428:16.65]They're all at least 9.5.
[428:17.37]Alright, just this side over here.
[428:45.75]And I'm probably going to call it sooner than I think.
[428:48.41]I might not even finish this one.
[428:49.93]I'm really hungry.
[428:50.79]I keep thinking of cheesy gordita crunches and I want one right now and I want to go eat one.
[429:03.50]Diablo or WoW Classic?
[429:06.76]Diablo II.
[429:10.17]That's not an easy one to answer though.
[429:13.21]I still think Diablo II beats it.
[429:21.10]My god.
[429:25.68]Get up there.
[429:33.02]Diablo II is just... You don't get better than that.
[429:37.92]I think Diablo II is a 10.
[429:40.71]Well, Diablo II Lord of Destruction.
[429:47.19]That game was so good.
[429:57.59]Am I going to play the Diablo II remake?
[429:59.23]I mean, probably.
[430:00.23]I don't know if I'm going to stream that, though.
[430:04.10]I'm not sure.
[430:04.64]I think that's something that I want to do on my own time.
[430:06.42]I'm going to do it.
[430:06.90]And then whenever Elden Ring decides to come out, yeah.
[430:27.45]Elaborate?
[430:29.15]Um... I don't know.
[430:30.95]I kind of would just want to play D2 on my own.
[430:34.73]Just sit there with my mouth open.
[430:36.46]That's my McDonald's order.
[430:50.15]It really depends on the day, but usually it's... Right now, I'd say it's two McChickens, two McDoubles, and a Big Mac.
[431:04.82]And a six-piece nugget.
[431:19.59]and two cherry pies.
[431:29.61]Window frame is so finicky.
[431:31.64]There it is.
[431:40.24]Very good boy.
[431:47.30]You're a liar.
[431:48.82]Now, it's two McChickens and two McDoubles, and then if I'm really, really hungry, I'll get nuggets.
[431:54.48]Like a six-piece.
[432:08.55]That's not obscene.
[432:09.69]They're not even that big.
[432:10.85]A McDonald's patty is like two ounces.
[432:15.28]What's a McDonald's burger patty?
[432:18.57]It's two and a half ounces or three ounces, isn't it?
[432:30.35]It's like a two or three ounce patty.
[432:33.05]You know, there are people that make four, six, five, six, seven ounce patties.
[432:39.23]It's not a joke.
[432:39.87]What even is a joke?
[432:46.26]I hate big patties.
[432:48.36]I think they're gross.
[432:51.46]If your patty is bigger than your bun... You got a problem.
[432:55.96]There's a problem there.
[433:04.99]The ratio of meat to bun has to be different.
[433:07.53]Has to be enough where you get... I would say... Meat to bun ratio... Like... The meat should be... Half as big as the bun.
[433:20.19]Maybe even a little less.
[433:36.59]In terms of volume or mass?
[433:41.67]Like thickness.
[433:43.13]Your bun should never be thicker.
[433:44.95]Your bun should never be the same thickness as your meat.
[434:02.32]Because then all the condiments have to go on.
[434:05.00]All your lettuce, your... You know, if you have tomato, I mean, that's disgusting.
[434:09.05]But if you put it on there, good for you.
[434:11.51]You've got your cheese.
[434:12.55]You've got your onion, potentially.
[434:14.03]You've got your chopped onion.
[434:15.05]Not whole onion circles.
[434:18.18]No, thank you.
[434:21.36]Ketchup, mustard, pickles, whatever.
[434:38.97]That one felt good.
[434:48.92]You don't like tomato?
[434:49.48]No, I don't like cold, wet tomato on my hamburger.
[434:53.44]I like tomato.
[434:54.16]I just don't like it on a hamburger.
[434:55.70]I don't think it belongs there.
[434:58.96]Alright, the house is clean.
[435:00.12]Alright, I'm probably going to call it here.
[435:05.38]Just don't look at the side of the house.
[435:10.49]I need to go get a... I need to get some food.
[435:11.99]I'm hungry.
[435:19.13]I gotta get to 50%.
[435:20.27]Once it's 50%, I'll leave.
[435:23.87]But thanks for watching, everybody.
[435:24.77]This has been Power Washer Simulator.
[435:26.85]It's very good.
[435:27.48]It's very relaxing.
[435:28.26]It's very fun.
[435:28.84]I'm surprised I sat here for 7 hours and 15 minutes.
[435:31.30]It was a lot of fun.
[435:33.70]I had a good time.
[435:35.60]I'll see you guys next week for E3.
[435:37.88]I'm going to do at least the Microsoft conference.
[435:40.90]We'll see you after that.
[435:51.03]We'll see you soon.
[435:54.73]It is my 10-year anniversary online on YouTube and Twitch and everything.
[436:00.14]That's happening, I believe, on Thursday.
[436:01.62]I'm probably not going to go live for it.
[436:03.96]We'll talk about it at E3.
[436:08.76]But in case I miss you, it's been 10 years officially as of this week.
[436:19.51]It's been a wild ride.
[436:20.63]It's been fun.
[436:23.51]We'll talk about it some more this next weekend.
[436:27.91]Not my birthday yet.
[436:28.53]Alright, yeah, I'm going to call here.
[436:30.71]I need some food.
[436:33.57]I will see you guys on whenever the Microsoft conference is.
[436:37.69]Have a great rest of your week.
[436:41.30]Very, very soon here I'll have a lot more to talk about.
[436:45.26]There's another few projects that are coming up that
[436:49.36]They're going to be in September, August.
[436:55.66]Talked about baseball.
[436:56.52]Baseball is confirmed.
[436:57.52]It's a go.
[436:58.02]It's happening.
[436:58.52]There's a lot of things happening.
[437:00.99]I hope you think they're interesting.
[437:04.79]I'll see you soon.
[437:07.11]Let's transition out of here.
[437:08.19]Go to the credits.
[437:12.53]There we are.
[437:15.49]Yeah, the baseball stream is confirmed to be happening at some point in September.
[437:19.33]There's another big stream that's happening in August, which I'll talk about more later.
[437:23.50]Among a couple other small things.
[437:29.60]Don't forget about Mizkif.
[437:32.16]Yeah, I'll hit him up.
[437:33.16]I'll see what the deal is.
[437:36.39]That might be fun too.
[437:48.34]When is your Among Us stream?
[437:51.14]Never gonna play Among Us.
[437:54.48]How late to the meme do you guys really want me to be?
[438:01.76]You really want me to be that late to the meme?
[438:03.46]Two years too late.
[438:17.76]Yeah, I'm getting Taco Bell.
[438:19.12]I'm into it.
[438:19.84]Let's do it.
[438:26.35]Play it the day the servers go down.
[438:30.69]We'll find that out.
[438:31.47]We'll find the day the servers turn off.
[438:35.47]And I'll play it on that day.
[438:36.97]I don't think that's going to happen.
[438:45.62]I really doubt that'll happen.
[438:51.95]It's still really popular.
[438:53.35]I think it's a lot more popular than you guys are giving it credit for still.
[439:11.71]Raid Miskif?
[439:12.77]Alright, we're gonna raid Miskif.
[439:16.65]I mean, we've been talking about him all stream.

[439:27.69]It's been like seven hours of us talking about him.
[439:33.52]Go say hello.
