[00:05.33]Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode four of Grandpa is the best player in the fucking world.
[00:13.66]And in this episode, you probably can already tell, I got banned from Modern Warfare 3, so I gotta play a different game.
[00:21.40]And that game that I'm gonna play is
[00:24.07]Battlefield 3.
[00:26.23]The most realistic war simulator on the world.
[00:31.55]So here we go.
[00:32.89]I already installed Origin on my computer.
[00:36.85]And it lets... What the... I don't meet the minimum system requirements?
[00:44.30]What kind of fucking shitty computer is this?
[00:47.89]What kind of piece of fucking shit computer does Jeremy even own?
[00:51.71]I'm going to the library.
[00:52.85]They got a supercomputer there.
[00:54.21]I've seen it.
[00:55.63]Okay, so I'm at the college library, and I got on their science computer.
[01:00.36]This computer has like five processors, and as you can tell, it's handling Battlefield 3 flawlessly.
[01:07.06]And I've been playing this game for a total of 16 minutes, which means I can now give you the strategies and all the tips you need to know.
[01:16.21]So the first thing we want to talk about is vehicles.
[01:18.94]Vehicles are really important in Battlefield, especially the Jeep, because you take this fucking thing off-road like this.
[01:25.31]And if I ever catch you on the road with this thing, I'm gonna slap the shit out of you.
[01:31.24]Next I want to teach you how to properly fly a jet.
[01:34.36]So it's kind of tricky, what you want to do is make sure you pitch up right at the right moment.
[01:38.94]God fucking dammit.
[01:41.00]Okay, I'm currently in a nosedive, but fuck it.
[01:44.12]I will get this, I will get it.
[01:46.00]Stupid piece of shit, I'm gonna fuck worse than this game sucks.
[01:49.53]This one, let me get the fuck out of the way.
[01:51.11]Get out of the fucking way!
[01:53.19]Think I got the hang of it, guys, I finally got... Oh shit.
[01:56.71]Whoa, what the hell?
[01:58.29]What is going on?
[01:59.17]I'm still alive.
[02:00.67]This is... What?
[02:01.59]What is happening?
[02:03.16]What?
[02:03.62]I just killed somebody.
[02:05.22]What the fuck?
[02:08.60]I may actually need some help with this game.
[02:12.52]Uh, sir?
[02:13.22]Yeah, what?
[02:14.00]Sorry to bother you, but we've been receiving some noise complaints from the Spartan Library, and... Well, those people need to deal with it.
[02:20.50]Sir, this is a library, and you can't play video games on the library's computers.
[02:24.42]I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to... Well, I'm a professor at this college of, uh, of math, it's... mathematicalology.
[02:31.23]Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Professor.
[02:33.15]And this is a very important research project, so go away before you get fired because you're messing with a professor.
[02:40.73]I'll leave you to your research.
[02:42.76]You guys, uh, you guys sell booze here?
[02:46.42]No, we do not serve alcohol in the library, sir.
[02:51.05]Okay, so I'm in here with Shibby2142.
[02:55.41]He's the best battlefield player in the world, and I decided to hire him at a very, very stable rate to teach me how to play his game and what to do.
[03:04.86]So, what's the first thing I need to know?
[03:07.78]Alright, well, first thing you need to know, old man, is that you're on the clock, so let's quit screwing around and get going.
[03:13.00]Okay, well, wait, where are you going?
[03:16.04]Hey, Chevy, what's up?
[03:17.38]Just hanging out here looking out the window at some girls.
[03:19.94]Hey, can we pretend there's girls we're looking at?
[03:22.88]There's a lot.
[03:24.06]Tango Charlie behind us.
[03:26.10]I see him, I see him.
[03:27.26]Tango Bravo.
[03:28.80]Grandpa, just prone.
[03:29.62]I'll take care of this.
[03:30.64]I'm a pro.
[03:32.18]Tango Charles Dickens.
[03:34.27]What am I paying you for anyways?
[03:36.79]Well, considering you owe me about, uh, $6,000, we'll just, uh, we'll call it that.
[03:42.55]Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean I owe you $6,000?
[03:46.34]What, you don't remember if you died?
[03:48.76]Well, that was a, that was bullshit!
[03:49.94]Uh, I don't think so.
[03:52.42]That was a fucking joke!
[03:54.48]Can't take a joke, Mr. 2142!
[03:56.36]Hello?
[03:58.28]Hello?
[04:03.06]Hello?
[04:05.44]You piece of shit!
[04:07.67]Excuse me, professor?
[04:10.03]Yeah, what's the matter?
[04:11.01]What is it?
[04:11.82]I just had a look through the staff directory and your name doesn't appear to be on the list.
[04:17.23]Well, that's because my professor name is Professor Steven Seagalson.
[04:22.71]And that should be there.
[04:24.03]Go check again.
[04:24.73]Sir, I'm absolutely sure you are not a professor here.
[04:27.60]You need to leave immediately.
[04:29.88]I've already contacted campus security and they will be here shortly.
[04:33.38]Well, that's it.
[04:33.78]You don't have to do that.
[04:34.70]I'm already on my way out.
[04:36.12]You see, I'm getting up.
[04:37.38]I'm up off the computer now.
[04:38.68]Just let me just touch this bookcase and look at it for a second.
[04:43.78]Just want to make sure I can get, you know, my hands on it enough to make a distraction for my escape!
