[00:01.29]Into venue?
[00:02.67]A theater.
[00:03.34]A theater, you know.
[00:05.66]I'm having fun, bro.
[00:06.54]Yo, what's up?
[00:07.06]Are we on Twitch?
[00:07.72]Okay, bye.
[00:08.16]Fantastic, my friend.
[00:09.32]Thank you so much.
[00:09.82]Appreciate it.
[00:10.30]Do I grab the mic?
[00:11.74]no I'm just holding it so that they hear what you're saying yeah well let me tell you something 14 hours ago so okay well it looks fantastic when I saw you walking in I noticed something weird about it yeah so the back so the back of the suit it has this little thing that you're supposed to cut before you put it on and I didn't do that and uh and one of the production people was like hey jerma uh you you gotta cut the back of the suit and
[00:34.57]And I was like, what are you talking about?
[00:35.54]And they were like, wait, just don't go on camera yet.
[00:38.02]And they ran and grabbed a pair of scissors and they snipped me back there.
[00:42.04]Okay.
[00:43.22]I'm good now.
[00:43.78]You're nominated in two categories?
[00:46.98]I guess so, yeah, two categories.
[00:49.23]Which ones?
[00:50.89]League of Their Own and Best Streamed Event.
[00:54.51]So which one do you think, you know, which one's your favorite one to be nominated for?
[00:58.56]I mean, I think they're both... That's absolutely insane that people care that much to nominate before anything in the first place, but... I mean, the Dollhouse event was some of the most fun I've ever had on stream ever.
[01:09.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10.61]Will we see, like, a follow-up on that thing?
[01:14.50]We need a little bit more money and maybe a little bit more hands on deck, because that was a huge production, so... If there was ever a Dollhouse 2, I think it would be... It would have to be, like, six levels.
[01:26.38]Okay.
[01:27.00]I've got a few token questions that I ask people, and we're on Twitch, so I want to ask you, what's your favorite third-party emote?
[01:33.38]Third-party emote?
[01:34.32]Yes.
[01:36.04]Pepe Snow, the dancing Pepe Christmas emote.
[01:39.72]Oh, is it the guy that goes like... Alright, excellent.
[01:43.63]We're getting ready to wrap things up.
[01:44.99]Any shout-outs you want to do?
[01:48.03]Uh...
[01:51.72]Shout out to Holly, my girlfriend.
[01:53.84]Excellent.
[01:55.12]Jerma, everybody.
[01:55.98]We're going to toss it over.
[01:56.98]Thank you.
[01:57.90]Holly.
[01:58.90]Oh, you missed it, Holly.
[01:59.80]You missed it.
[02:01.16]Cutie asked me to make a song about Twitch Prime.
[02:04.55]That was my line.
[02:08.93]Why?
[02:09.39]I don't know.
[02:10.71]I don't know.

[04:16.60]I...
[04:25.72]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:33.43]Every, every, every single person here had an incredibly important role.
[04:39.47]And without them, without every single person here, it doesn't happen.
[04:42.78]See you later.
[04:43.28]I was an uncle at a wedding.
[04:47.06]But here to present stream game of the year is Jerma.
[04:59.79]Hello.
[05:02.33]Interesting that I'm presenting this award considering that my top streamed game is a game where you clean houses.
[05:09.01]House Flipper and Fart Simulator 2013.
[05:13.21]Which is a great game, by the way.
[05:14.87]I suggest you all download it.
[05:17.39]But all seriousness, every one of these nominees is a huge, dedicated community of people that love these games, and some of them
[05:28.27]their communities have moved their games forward without the developer.
[05:33.13]So, which is a huge, cool thing.
[05:35.11]So without further ado, I'm going to announce the nominees for, and I don't open it yet.
[05:39.39]I don't know the winner.
[05:41.27]The nominees for best stream game of the year is Grand Theft Auto five.
[05:49.68]We've got some GTA five fans in here.
[05:51.30]Of course, Valorant, Minecraft,
[05:58.37]Everybody loves Minecraft.
[05:59.73]Apex Legends.
[06:03.49]Alright, everybody shut up for a second.
[06:07.53]The winner of the best stream game of the year is... Minecraft.
[06:22.14]So there's nobody here to accept the Minecraft award, so we have to...
[06:28.99]Oh, Jesus.
[06:30.57]That's a creeper.
[06:32.15]Just take it.
[06:32.73]Just take it.
[06:34.65]I'll be completely honest.
[06:35.73]My and Cutie grabbed me last minute.
[06:37.83]They grabbed me last minute.
[06:39.03]And the winner, Juma95 with the dollar house.
[06:55.17]I'm refunding these shoes.
[07:07.12]So I got to bring Jake up here because he is 50% of that show.
[07:13.24]He's also running this show, and I stole him from backstage to come and say a few things.
[07:21.58]First of all, I got to say, first, thank you.
[07:23.42]That's insane.
[07:24.92]To the fellow nominees, keep doing this shit.
[07:29.16]The Price is Scuffed, fucking awesome show.

[07:50.61]I want to say thanks to this entire community, but really,
[07:55.75]Keep reaching.
[07:56.63]Keep doing this shit.
[07:58.59]We'd love to see it.
[07:59.59]I love to see this kind of stuff.
[08:01.41]This event right now is one of those events that takes a ton of time, ton of energy, ton of just manpower.
[08:07.41]It's crazy.
[08:08.81]So thank you so much, Jake.
[08:10.17]You probably have something to say.
[08:11.57]Yeah, I just want to say thanks to the cast and crew that made Dollhouse happen.
[08:16.19]It was six months of my life that I would- That he'll never get back, by the way.
[08:20.49]That I would love to relive as often as possible.
[08:23.69]We built a house in a warehouse, and we filled it with people, and we filled it with cameras.
[08:28.82]And that crew, a lot of that crew is here today.
[08:30.72]A lot of that crew works on a lot of shows like The Price of Scuff with Pay Money Wabi.
[08:34.76]We've just had an amazing year, and thank you all for watching and making it real.
[08:38.80]Yeah, and get back to work.

[09:02.75]Oh, Jerma just broke his trophy.
[09:04.63]Did you break a trophy, Jerma?
[09:06.13]Jerma.
[09:08.35]You know who else broke a trophy tonight?
[09:10.06]We should call it out.

[09:58.73]I love you.
[10:00.07]We went to high school together.

[11:18.94]He deserves it.
[11:20.61]Kitboga, SushiDragon.
[11:21.95]Is SushiDragon here?
