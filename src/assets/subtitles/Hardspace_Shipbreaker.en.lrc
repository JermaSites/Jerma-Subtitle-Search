[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.16]Okay.
[00:03.62]So, I have no idea how this game works.
[00:05.72]We're going to give it a try.
[00:07.13]See if it's any good.
[00:10.29]Hard Space Shipbreaker.
[00:12.39]Okay.
[00:12.87]I did already make an account in this game because I knew we were probably going to pivot.
[00:16.61]Because... I don't know.
[00:19.37]I had it just in case.
[00:20.23]We needed to do it, right?
[00:21.03]Turn this shit on so you can hear it.
[00:30.56]And...
[00:33.59]Let me add it.
[00:35.57]Not added yet.
[00:41.68]Looking for a... There you are.
[00:47.84]This is a hard spaceship breaker.
[00:49.34]It's a Viscera Cleanup Detail in space, is what I've been told.
[00:53.41]We're ready for Evolva.
[00:54.47]Okay, anybody that says anything that says Evolva in it and please play it, I want you to ban them for at least four hours.
[01:02.53]At least.
[01:03.99]That's like 240,000 minutes.
[01:07.65]Don't want that one.
[01:08.33]Alright, let's go.
[01:12.81]This is me, Jerry.
[01:16.31]Career.
[01:26.51]Please, please.
[01:30.51]How do you, how does this game work?
[01:34.45]I guess it's going to tell me, right?
[01:38.59]It's customary to observe a moment of silence for a departed shipwrecker.
[01:44.58]Wait, was I supposed to jump?
[01:46.00]I'm just floating away.
[01:55.68]Let's get to work.
[01:58.72]Alright, how do I do this?
[01:59.98]Ab.
[02:00.60]Open the work order.
[02:24.43]Thrust forward.
[02:25.65]Thrust backward.
[02:26.83]Descend.
[02:27.73]Ascend.
[02:29.47]Brake.
[02:31.03]Roll.
[02:32.61]Oh, boy.
[02:33.52]Thrust backwards.
[02:36.64]Okay.
[02:42.96]Now, uh, descend for three seconds.
[02:45.60]I want to change that, though.
[02:46.79]I don't like C as descend.
[02:55.48]Ascend for three seconds.
[02:58.10]Control is a break.
[03:00.68]I'm so glad there's a break that's a hard break.
[03:02.46]Rapple.
[03:04.04]Give rolls.
[03:04.54]Yeah, roll left for two seconds.
[03:21.78]That's alright.
[03:23.44]I've been known to at least get an hour into puke games.
[03:28.74]Grapple.
[03:36.68]What?
[03:40.36]Grapple.
[03:40.76]Hold.
[03:41.10]Push an object when grappled is F. Some objects can be detached with your grapple.
[03:46.19]Look for the detach prompt.
[03:52.35]Whoa, wait a minute.
[03:53.65]That's a push?
[03:56.45]So F pushes.
[04:01.42]I want it to send.
[04:02.08]Can you not move when you're in the... Okay, maybe you can't move.
[04:10.66]Alright, salvage the antenna.
[04:11.96]How do you salvage something?
[04:16.23]Grapple?
[04:16.59]And then I drag it over here?
[04:28.06]Green arrows.
[04:30.83]Yeah, but how do I pull it over there?
[04:32.15]Use the grapple to attach an antenna.
[04:37.37]Push when an- Push.
[04:42.54]No!
[04:43.90]That's not an antenna?
[04:47.30]Oh, what- where the- where the fuck is an antenna?
[04:53.57]Wait, that's the antenna!
[04:56.39]This doesn't look like an antenna.
[05:01.09]I thought it wanted me to grapple the weird things.
[05:04.13]I don't know.
[05:04.57]It didn't... Okay.
[05:07.11]Grapple the antenna.
[05:08.43]Okay.
[05:10.63]Hit the brakes.
[05:11.93]Brakes!
[05:13.01]Brakes!
[05:14.39]Brake.
[05:16.13]Oh, this is not going to work well.
[05:17.33]This is going to be bad.
[05:17.85]This is going to be bad.
[05:19.29]This is going to be very bad.
[05:19.91]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[05:26.85]Attach an antenna.
[05:27.68]This is going to be really tricky.
[05:34.57]Okay, grab and detach.
[05:49.92]Shoot the antenna.
[05:55.14]Didn't I just do that?
[05:55.86]Alright, then throw it in there.
[06:03.68]physics gun the whole game is physics
[06:32.46]No Scanner cut points Cut points I see some Are they yellow?
[07:01.03]Okay, so you need to cut this shit.
[07:03.09]Cut level two.
[07:05.73]Execute the cut.
[07:08.43]Grapple.
[07:08.67]Equip the cutter.
[07:09.65]Z. It's two.
[07:10.09]Why would it be Z?
[07:11.05]Okay.
[07:30.16]Okay.
[07:31.48]Let me see it.
[07:31.92]I'm trying to do the cut.
[07:38.56]Okay, I just pressed two.
[07:44.31]I pressed it like five times.
[07:50.35]Descend!
[07:52.11]It's C. Oh my god, it's not control.
[07:58.68]You were grappling.
[08:03.58]Amazon keyboard.
[08:05.34]No, no, I don't even know what direction I'm even looking at this fucking thing.
[08:10.21]Alright, scan it.
[08:11.23]Right there.
[08:11.59]Alright, stop moving.
[08:14.95]Cut that.
[08:22.72]Cutting it?
[08:23.06]Did I do it?
[08:32.59]Cut point, right there, right?
[08:40.72]Does it have to go through it?
[08:42.02]Isn't the cut point right here?
[08:47.38]Salvage it, yeah.
[08:48.22]But do I have to pull it off?
[08:49.36]I don't understand.
[08:55.59]Do I have to be, like, looking...
[08:59.44]I thought it was x-ray vision, guys.
[09:01.20]I thought it was x-ray vision.
[09:06.48]I thought that was inside of this thing.
[09:11.85]Wait.
[09:11.97]Is it because I'm too far away?
[09:19.61]What the fuck is going on?
[09:20.54]Am I not cutting it?
[09:27.90]Okay, so you have to be right next to it.
[09:38.99]Okay.
[09:40.15]There's another one right here.
[09:42.65]There it goes.
[09:43.23]Alright, cool.
[09:44.01]I get it.
[10:02.79]Can I spin this thing around?
[10:06.88]Wrong timing, though.
[10:09.82]Ugh, the floating around.
[10:10.88]You guys watch me play Outer Wilds.
[10:12.26]This is like extra controls.
[10:24.07]I want space to be down.
[10:25.91]Space should be down.
[10:29.11]And I want... What the hell do I want?
[10:30.47]Like, one of the mouse buttons.
[10:36.38]Okay, so that's that side done.
[10:39.44]Cut this thing right here.
[10:40.30]I don't think you have to actually cut it.
[10:50.01]I think you just have to heat it up until it disappears.
[11:03.78]Okay, cool.
[11:04.14]I'm gonna salvage this thing somehow.
[11:10.82]So can I... Do I have to go around it?
[11:12.98]Can this thing... This thing actually cut through walls.
[11:21.63]Okay, so I'm done cutting.
[11:26.79]Am I?
[11:28.13]So it cuts through walls.
[11:31.43]Is there face damage?
[11:32.35]Is there like, end of the screen damage?
[11:34.03]I'm just gonna hold the brake the whole time.
[11:53.21]I had it right.
[11:54.47]Go closer.
[12:04.35]Go closer.
[12:05.11]What the fuck?
[12:05.89]What?
[12:06.31]I... I don't... What am I doing wrong?
[12:20.32]The arrows.
[12:23.97]What?
[12:24.81]I'm not supposed to cut all this shit?
[12:30.15]Er...
[12:36.69]Just pick it up?
[12:45.41]Alright, where's that salvage thing?
[12:46.47]Alright, throw it.
[12:59.30]Is that going to get in there or is that not going to make it?
[13:09.76]It's not gonna make it.
[13:10.44]It's space.
[13:32.59]Yeah, isn't it?
[13:34.17]It's supposed to be.
[13:47.40]Not flat Earth.
[13:48.38]You don't have to grapple to push?
[13:52.01]Oh.
[13:52.11]Alright.
[13:52.93]Okay.
[13:53.15]I get it.
[13:53.47]Cool.
[13:54.53]Don't have to cut all the yellow.
[13:55.69]Just the ones that they point at.
[13:56.91]Cool.
[13:57.57]Go ahead and see where you're at on earning your first cert.
[14:05.00]Alright.
[14:06.38]Certification.
[14:07.02]16 out of 16.
[14:09.30]I got it.
[14:09.76]I'm good.
[14:10.36]I have a hot trillion dollars.
[14:13.92]Why am I working here?
[14:15.69]Oh, that's my debt.
[14:16.47]That's how much I owe.
[14:18.67]Oh, okay.
[14:19.15]... ... ... ... ... ... ...
[14:36.05]Go home.
[14:36.53]Trillion dollar debt.
[14:37.23]Yeah, that's weird.
[14:38.70]That seems like a lot.
[15:08.09]Alright, I got it.
[15:08.71]I went home.
[15:16.67]Get in the habitat.
[15:20.09]He did it!
[15:20.61]Woah!
[15:21.49]Yay!
[15:24.16]Rank two.
[15:26.38]You've achieved the prestigious rank of basic certification.
[15:30.00]You unlocked modular laser cutter upgrades and ship class.
[15:36.75]Yeah, complete the shift.
[15:40.35]Top of the morning to you, Cutter.
[15:42.53]As you know by now, this... Minimum payments are due?
[15:46.47]I know it feels a bit flat right now, but I hear Lynx is looking into fixing it up real nice for you sometime in the near future.
[15:54.90]Anyway, it says here you're going to need an upgrade to complete your next certification rank.
[16:00.76]Whoa, what's this?
[16:01.64]You're going to like this one, Cutter.
[16:03.62]Let's check it out now, shall we?
[16:05.82]laser cutter okay so this is split saw license cutting head fires a splitting beam for speedier and more capable ship disassembly yeah that sounds cool now let's get back to the yard so you can try this sucker out oh start shift okay before we hop back in the yard I want to show you the ship catalog
[16:31.84]That's too many things.
[16:34.50]I don't understand all these things.
[16:39.36]Thank you.
[16:40.16]Can you tell everybody in chat that please?
[16:42.10]I can't run until I know how to walk.
[16:44.62]Establish maximum amount of value.
[16:59.24]Oh, okay.
[16:59.56]Split saw.
[16:59.97]I can swap the head?
[17:01.45]Okay.
[17:01.85]Rotate the cut angle.
[17:02.81]Alright, let's go.
[17:29.32]Work order?
[17:31.02]Alright, salvage the soft crate, the aluminum, and the nano carbon.
[17:36.32]Alright, where's the aluminum?
[17:37.84]Alright, processor.
[17:42.71]We're going to the processor.
[17:43.69]This one here.
[17:44.09]What do we got?
[17:45.35]There's nothing in there.
[17:55.24]Where's the aluminum?
[18:00.10]I was about to go into it.
[18:02.08]I was about to trash myself.
[18:06.22]Into the furnace.
[18:08.50]I thought these were like Mario paintings.
[18:12.76]I was going to go in them.
[18:13.78]Oh, here.
[18:14.10]This is this area.
[18:15.04]Alright.
[18:17.46]Is this thing right here?
[18:18.22]Oh, this panel is aluminum.
[18:21.63]Oh, sick!
[18:25.99]Why can't I pull it off?
[18:30.01]Alright, this is cutting angle.
[18:31.97]Gotta go right here, ready?
[18:33.97]That was pretty cool.
[18:37.16]Did it do anything?
[18:38.46]Oh fuck, I just didn't mean to do that.
[18:39.86]Wait, I took it off.
[18:41.30]Am I supposed to do that?
[18:46.68]Wait!
[18:52.74]Like this, right?
[19:10.88]Wow.
[19:13.08]I got it.
[19:13.51]It's aluminum.
[19:19.29]Okay, I like this game.
[19:21.69]This game's cool.
[19:22.66]Let's go.
[19:24.98]I need one that can carry heavy objects.
[19:29.90]Into the processor.
[19:30.86]Right?
[19:31.06]The processor wants aluminum?
[19:39.45]Processor.
[19:39.89]Aluminum.
[19:40.83]Doesn't want aluminum.
[19:43.51]No!
[19:57.64]Fired.
[20:00.52]Oh, there's a processor in here.
[20:02.14]Hold on.
[20:02.50]This computer's in here.
[20:03.48]Is this somebody's computer?
[20:04.42]Is there a flashlight?
[20:05.98]Wait, where's the processor?
[20:08.07]I just saw it.
[20:12.25]Is that it?
[20:12.71]Is that a processor?
[20:14.33]Is there a flashlight?
[20:24.81]There's not.
[20:25.47]Alright, but that's a... What else does it connect to?
[20:28.81]Okay.
[20:32.34]I think I can just pick it up.
[20:37.20]Oh, shit.
[20:37.72]Okay, this processor.
[20:38.66]Be careful with this thing.
[20:41.68]Alright, get it in there.
[20:45.80]It's like Paperboy.
[20:56.11]It's not a processor.
[20:59.61]What?
[20:59.79]This is a barge.
[21:01.97]Furnace.
[21:04.43]Processor.
[21:05.57]Is processors in here?
[21:06.65]Wow, this computer sucks.
[21:15.25]I can't pick it up.
[21:16.75]I have to cut it out with this, don't I?
[21:28.71]Oh!
[21:33.49]He's pretending.
[21:36.71]What are you talking about?
[21:37.97]That processor's right there.
[21:39.97]I'm trying to pull it out.
[21:42.28]Can't pull it out.
[21:51.72]For the processor.
[21:52.82]Furnace.
[21:59.38]Barge.
[21:59.88]Well, we don't have... Oh.
[22:05.27]I don't have a barge.
[22:06.17]So what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?
[22:07.23]That's why it's freaking me out.
[22:08.03]Alright, cut this shit up.
[22:14.73]It's not a computer.
[22:23.44]This is still connected.
[22:24.18]Hold on.
[22:26.94]Okay.
[22:29.92]What else is there?
[22:30.72]It's still connected.
[22:31.50]Fuck you.
[22:31.96]Alright.
[22:33.28]Everything's... Nope.
[22:34.04]Down here.
[22:34.94]Disconnect this too.
[22:35.86]Alright.
[22:39.44]Everything's been disconnected.
[22:47.07]Okay.
[22:48.27]Caught this.
[22:54.10]They didn't say it had to be pretty.
[23:08.01]Come on, get up.
[23:13.21]This is supposed to go to the barge, but I don't have a barge.
[23:30.27]Alright, don't mess it up.
[23:31.17]Hit the brakes.
[23:36.11]Wow!
[23:39.97]It'll get in.
[23:40.37]We're good.
[23:52.33]What's that thing below you?
[23:53.87]Oh.
[23:59.43]Okay, where's that thing that I threw?
[24:00.61]What's that for?
[24:03.15]Barge?
[24:03.47]Alright, I got a barge.
[24:05.01]It's down here.
[24:09.13]Don't please get in the corner.
[24:10.81]Okay, good.
[24:17.36]Shit, I didn't do it though.
[24:18.28]I threw it.
[24:18.68]Alright, I get it now.
[24:19.78]I understand it now.
[24:32.33]Processor.
[24:34.75]Harness, I mean.
[24:36.92]Okay.
[24:37.32]Aluminum has been salvaged.
[24:43.90]That wasn't... Wait, what's going on?
[24:47.06]Why does it say processor now?
[24:48.44]What, is this a different material?
[24:57.42]The other one, the front panel was furnace.
[24:59.62]Panel, nanocarbon, processor.
[25:02.51]Okay.
[25:11.94]Maybe play a game that you can handle.
[25:16.16]Ban that guy for now.
[25:29.43]Do I have to cut anything on this?
[25:36.62]All this is going to the processor, so just punch it.
[25:38.74]I could cut it into smaller pieces, I could, but I could just dump it in here, couldn't I?
[25:55.17]This whole thing, processor, processor, yeah, the whole thing.
[25:56.89]Processor, processor, processor.
[25:58.01]Get it in there.
[26:05.74]Cool.
[26:07.16]Why cut them into small pieces when you can take the whole thing?
[26:08.99]Okay, this is all processor, processor, processor.
[26:16.61]Alright, get it in there.
[26:33.12]Eventually it's probably going to be too heavy to do that, but it's fine.
[26:40.41]Okay, let's go down.
[26:44.79]So this hole, this needs to go into the furnace.
[26:46.67]That's the barge.
[26:48.92]Let's get it.
[26:54.36]Alright, now we just need to do the aluminum.
[26:56.78]I gotta cut this though, don't I?
[27:06.22]I can't take the whole thing.
[27:07.20]Can I cut this in half?
[27:11.54]Or does that not work?
[27:15.87]Holy shit, that's awesome.
[27:17.47]Wait.
[27:24.34]This is actually how I cut up an apple.
[27:26.90]That's so cool.
[27:27.60]I just needed to see it for myself.
[27:28.60]Okay, processor, get it in there.
[27:40.68]Ernest.
[27:46.39]Ernest.
[27:48.93]This is awesome.
[27:51.01]This is awesome.
[27:52.17]I love this.
[27:52.65]Okay.
[27:54.71]Processor.
[27:55.69]You got it.
[27:56.05]Okay.
[28:02.21]Ernest.
[28:02.53]What is this?
[28:06.19]Let's go down.
[28:13.13]Alright, this is the furnace.
[28:13.93]We got like one crumb.
[28:20.72]I'm not doing that right.
[28:21.62]No, no, no, no, no.
[28:25.32]Give me, give me, give me.
[28:47.31]I don't know why I don't know why I get what you're saying but I get what you're saying I get it I don't know how it makes sense but it does somebody said this is like trying to stuff an entire steak in your mouth it yeah it kind of is it's that same energy it's got that same vibe to it
[29:10.60]Get this thing off.
[29:12.50]I gotta cut... Can I not cut through this shit?
[29:22.22]Alright, into the furnace.
[29:24.34]This is taking me so long to do this.
[29:27.64]This is gonna get, like, studied.
[29:28.88]There's gonna be a room full of guys in suits.
[29:34.83]Studying this.
[29:36.07]With lab coats on.
[29:44.12]Then I have to detach it.
[29:45.00]From here.
[29:46.74]Feels so good to do that though.
[29:55.32]I don't even care if it looks like shit.
[29:56.80]It feels good.
[29:57.46]Okay, don't let it fly away.
[30:00.37]Furnace.
[30:06.05]It'll get there.
[30:09.25]How many more do I need?

[30:16.85]Please!
[30:23.36]He's cutting the crust off his sandwiches.
[30:25.36]Alright, cut.
[30:42.04]This is going to a processor.
[30:43.32]What the fuck are you talking about?
[30:45.70]No, no, no.
[30:46.24]Only one of those goes into the processor.
[30:49.18]Stay right here.
[30:55.15]Which one of those goes in the processor?
[30:56.67]The thing on top?
[30:59.55]I need to swim over here.
[31:04.27]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[31:04.93]I have to cut this out.
[31:06.59]This is furnace.
[31:07.17]This is processor.
[31:07.93]I can't remove this.
[31:18.33]Oh!
[31:19.97]Oh!
[31:20.33]Wow, this is fun.
[31:24.04]Valuable object processed.
[31:25.88]Credits awarded.
[31:29.80]Sick.
[31:30.62]This game's awesome.
[31:32.58]I love this game.
[31:33.58]Okay, I need Momo for the furnace.

[31:56.42]I did it.
[31:57.02]Keep going?
[31:57.80]That's such a mess.
[31:59.54]I'd rather start new.
[32:01.12]Now that I get it.
[32:21.18]I truly get it now, so that things over there is just it's an absolute train wreck.
[32:34.02]Oh.

[32:38.36]Destroyed, I didn't lose any money though, right?
[32:40.20]Alright, that's fine.
[32:46.04]Well, congratulations on completing certification rank to their cutter.
[32:51.43]New equipment.
[32:52.85]Grapple.
[32:56.45]Heather.
[32:57.29]Heathers can be deployed to establish two electromagnetic anchors that pull objects along a field medium.
[33:03.80]Alright, that's huge.
[33:06.62]That's actually huge.
[33:07.40]Use ship catalog?
[33:08.92]What is this thing?
[33:10.20]What is that?
[33:22.23]I mean a new ship will clear the salvage bay of your existing ship What?
[33:34.86]Who cares?
[33:40.28]Yes, this is technically another cleaning game Oh man
[33:50.97]Wow!
[33:51.57]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[33:54.77]Cutters are temporarily disabled to prevent unnecessary destruction to company equipped by inexperienced cutters.
[33:59.98]Huh?
[34:00.14]Is this a tether?
[34:23.49]What happened?
[34:23.83]Alright, cancel tethers.
[34:26.25]Tether multiple objects together or stack multiple on a single object for even greater strength.
[34:44.35]Sick.
[34:44.65]Alright, I got it.
[34:46.69]I did tethers.
[34:54.50]Oh, it's pulling them in.
[34:55.40]Should it be doing that?
[34:56.08]Okay, now what?
[35:02.06]Cutter is disabled.
[35:07.02]Why is the cutter disabled?
[35:16.20]What is this?
[35:16.70]Can I pull this stuff off?
[35:23.77]Just tether to the barge.
[35:30.74]New work order.

[35:34.06]Okay.
[35:37.04]Where's my cutter?
[35:37.74]Why is it... My cutter's disabled.
[35:47.38]How do I delete the... I need to put this in the barge.
[35:52.59]Throw the thrusters into the barge.
[35:55.43]Why did they want me to tether these?
[35:56.91]I'm going to pull it.
[36:06.22]Okay.
[36:11.12]Cancel tether.
[36:13.96]That's not... What?
[36:15.68]What?
[36:18.78]That's like 600 light years away.
[36:20.50]I did not know the range was that extreme.
[36:26.52]Okay, my cutter only goes like four feet.
[36:31.15]My tethers go across the entire Atlantic Ocean.
[36:33.65]Alright, now for the fun stuff.
[36:49.31]Use more tethers?
[36:49.93]Oh shit.
[36:50.33]Okay, compression points?
[36:51.70]Okay, I see a lot of green.
[36:54.52]What's the green mean?
[37:19.98]Let's see if we can crack into this ship without making her pop.

[38:22.08]No more trigger or violent decompression.
[38:24.78]Believe me.
[38:25.48]Is it?

[56:20.69]I'm sorry, kids.
[56:47.44]What if Chuck E. Cheese became my best friend?
[56:49.22]Then I would definitely be in a cartoon universe.
[56:59.49]What is it still attached to?
[57:01.09]I want to just take the whole hull.
[57:03.12]There.
[57:09.89]Okay.
[57:11.47]Now what?
[57:13.35]Do more over here.
[57:24.36]I feel like that's a conversation I would have with my mother over the phone.
[57:27.43]And she would start to get worried.
[57:29.89]And ask me, like, if everything was, like, okay.
[57:33.81]Hey, mom, you wouldn't believe it.
[57:34.77]My new best friend is Chuck E. Cheese.
[57:36.09]You know, the rat from Chuck E. Cheese?
[57:37.55]He's coming over tomorrow.
[57:42.37]Uh, okay, Jeremy.
[57:44.29]Um, how do you feel?
[57:45.85]How are you feeling right now?
[57:51.00]That's a, like, how are you doing conversation that my mother would have.
[58:04.77]The CBD is taking over.
[58:06.55]Here we go.
[58:07.07]Look at this.
[58:07.78]Look at all this money.
[58:08.46]Look at all this money I'm going to get tethered together.
[58:12.50]Let's do a double tether.
[58:14.44]Right now, everyone's going to be like, holy shit, I didn't even think of that.
[58:18.04]There you go.
[58:18.36]Check it out.
[58:18.70]Look at that.
[58:26.39]Tether that, too.
[58:29.85]Tether this, too.
[58:31.95]Take the whole thing.
[58:36.72]Nice.
[58:38.89]It'll get there, don't worry.
[58:42.03]Being friends with Chuck E. Cheese is like a throwaway Family Guy bit.
[58:48.27]Yeah, but this is real.
[58:53.81]Oh, no furnace, right?
[58:54.87]Yeah.
[58:58.63]Can I take this whole thing now?
[59:03.18]Yes.
[59:05.58]Make a giant train.
[59:10.15]Need a little bit more tension over here.
[59:19.98]How's it breaking?
[59:21.82]Hold it.
[59:31.98]Shit.
[59:32.18]Did I lose it?
[59:35.27]There goes the broom.
[59:36.05]Whatever.
[59:36.35]I'm being hosted by Chuck E. Cheese.
[59:43.40]It just feels so weird to me.
[59:46.71]It just feels so... surreal.
