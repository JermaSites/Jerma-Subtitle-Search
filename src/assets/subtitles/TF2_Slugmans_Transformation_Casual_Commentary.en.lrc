[00:08.72]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.33]Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Pyro with the Degreaser, the Reserve Shooter, and the mailbox that I ripped out of my neighbor's yard.
[00:22.19]So today, guys, what I want to talk about is something important, something that I want to relay to you guys that's been going on in my life recently.
[00:30.87]And let's just get right into it here.
[00:33.25]I want to tell you the story about Slugman.
[00:36.32]If you don't know who Slugman is, Slugman is a guy in his late 20s, maybe potentially early 30s.
[00:42.78]Not yet, though.
[00:43.48]Not yet.
[00:44.06]Slugman's not 30 years old yet.
[00:46.02]Don't even say that to him or else I'll get pissed and be depressed.
[00:49.68]So Slugman is a guy that's a slug.
[00:52.27]He's a person slug.
[00:53.35]He's got like a regular human body.
[00:55.41]He's inside of a snail shell, and he's got those two antennas coming out, and he's like on the ground, like sliding around like a slug.
[01:02.48]He's Slugman.
[01:03.80]He's slow.
[01:05.28]He's very tired all the time.
[01:07.50]He's not that healthy.
[01:08.82]He feels like he's kind of lost a step or two.
[01:11.72]He doesn't feel like he's the same slug that he was five, six, seven years ago.
[01:16.46]And it gets him down.
[01:17.64]You know, when you're a slug, life sucks when you're a slug, unless you're Earthworm Jim.
[01:22.94]And Earthworm Jim isn't even a slug, he's a fucking earthworm, so that's completely different.
[01:28.48]Earthworms live in the soil, and sometimes they get superhuman super suits, and that's not, that doesn't happen to slugs.
[01:35.53]Slugman never had a superhuman super suit, and it's kind of depressing.
[01:39.15]Has there ever been a slug that you've ever thought of or realized that wasn't Gary from SpongeBob, that was like a super-powered awesome character?
[01:49.01]Gary's a cool character.
[01:49.95]Gary's a snail.
[01:50.99]They're still in the same family of bicuspids, or whatever family they happen to be part of.
[01:56.12]But whatever, regardless.
[01:58.19]Where am I going with this?
[01:59.03]What's the point of this video?
[02:00.29]The point of this video is, I'm Slugman.
[02:03.55]I have been Slugman for a very long time, for at least the last year or so.
[02:09.58]I haven't been very active.
[02:11.98]I've been letting my illnesses get me down.
[02:14.58]I've been feeling, like, weak and not like I was years ago, back when I felt great every day.
[02:21.87]And I changed it.
[02:23.23]I actually got off my slug ass, got out of the snail shell I was in, slid down the street on my slug ass face, and got to the gym for the first time in months.
[02:34.60]And I feel better than I have ever felt in the last at least six to twelve months.
[02:40.51]And I've tried.
[02:41.65]I've tried to go back previously, but it never really clicked.
[02:46.00]It never really locked into my brain.
[02:48.40]Hey, this is something that I want to do every day.
[02:50.56]I want to get out.
[02:51.14]I want to get active.
[02:52.26]When I can just say to myself, nah, you know, I'll do that like next week.
[02:56.42]I'd rather sit down and drink like four sodas and stuff like my face with hamburgers.
[03:01.26]Oh, that's a great idea.
[03:02.62]Mmm.
[03:03.99]Actually, it's not a great idea.
[03:05.67]It's not a very good idea at all to just be sitting around like a slugman, not doing any activity.
[03:11.49]I wasn't doing any physical activity.
[03:13.73]The only physical activity I was really doing was getting up and walking around from my bathroom to here, my desk, and getting up and going in my car and driving places.
[03:24.98]Without the aforementioned couple of times that I tried to get back into the gym and try to be healthy,
[03:31.74]I was a slug.
[03:32.58]That's all I was doing.
[03:33.88]And I'm gonna take a direct quote here from Benjamin Franklin, who just recently graced us at the Jerma Rumble.
[03:40.90]And he actually said this backstage to Burgah Boy, because Burgah Boy was drinking like two or three milkshakes before he got called down.
[03:47.70]He walked up to Burgah Boy and he said,
[03:49.84]And we all know what happened.
[03:51.29]Benjamin Franklin kicked his ass within 20 seconds of Burgah Boy coming down to the arena.
[03:54.31]So Benjamin Franklin could have some merit with that quote.
[04:11.14]And it really just means, guys, not to go crazy with anything.
[04:16.18]Everything in moderation seriously just means if you're gonna do something, if you're gonna be unhealthy for a day, then don't be unhealthy the next day.
[04:25.17]Go be active, go ride your bike, go play basketball, go to the gym, go do something that's not just sitting down eating hamburgers.
[04:33.53]And I did this for a long time.
[04:36.37]And I started to feel real bad.
[04:38.43]And it's my sort of PSA video for you guys.
[04:41.60]This little commentary here is just...
[04:44.52]Find something active that you like to do.
[04:47.62]Get a couple of your friends together to see if they would like to do it too.
[04:50.68]Or even at your own house.
[04:52.42]At least like once or twice a week, just do something.
[04:54.86]It makes you feel so much better about life in general when you are actively doing something.
[05:00.96]And I know the last few months it's been hard, at least up here in the Northeast.
[05:05.09]It's been really cold.
[05:06.55]And if you live in a really cold climate, it can be pretty difficult.
[05:09.85]But there are indoor places, there are indoor gyms that you can go to.
[05:13.43]to do sort of different activities.
[05:15.53]And I highly recommend it because, my God, I feel like a Superman right now.
[05:21.39]Like, Superman, away!
[05:23.47]Like, I feel like that right now.
[05:25.66]And I just can't believe that I ever let it get this far, that I ever took this much time away from doing anything physical, trying to get active.
[05:33.87]I died for too long.
[05:35.25]And now I understand what people mean when they say, it just piles on top of each other.
[05:41.27]You don't even realize it's happening until a year goes by, two years goes by, whatever, and you just look at the clock and look at the date and you're like, wait a second.
[05:50.35]Has it really been that long since this?
[05:52.23]That I did that?
[05:54.15]I understand that now, because I did it.
[05:56.62]But anyways, guys, that's gonna wrap up the video.
[05:59.08]Thank you so much for watching, really do appreciate it.
[06:01.24]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[06:02.40]And of course, take care, everybody.
[06:05.36]We're gonna do one more.
[06:07.18]We're gonna do one more.
[06:07.94]No, I can't do it.
[06:08.62]I can't do one more.
[06:09.26]You can do one more.
[06:10.00]You're gonna do one more, okay?
[06:12.16]I can do it.
[06:12.58]Come on.
[06:13.20]Yeah!
