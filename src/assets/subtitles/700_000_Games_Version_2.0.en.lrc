[ve:61.7.100]

[00:01.23]Hi guys.
[00:04.47]Welcome.
[00:06.69]Welcome to a stream that is gonna be a little all over the place, I think.
[00:15.07]This is gonna be interesting.
[00:17.77]You probably saw the title already.
[00:20.55]This is 700,000 games.
[00:24.11]No, it is not 700,000 games from a couple years back.
[00:28.80]Or a year and a half, whatever it was.
[00:31.10]This is the sequel.
[00:32.84]This is 700,000 Games 2.
[00:37.62]I'm not just playing the old one.
[00:40.52]They did it again.
[00:43.50]They did it again!
[00:45.62]They packed 700,000 more games into this teeny tiny little disc.
[00:52.50]How do they even get it in there?
[00:56.64]So they, over the two versions, have 1.4 million games.
[01:02.26]Oh, that coffee is very hot.
[01:04.62]I'm gonna let it sit there for a minute.
[01:08.82]But yeah, this is version two.
[01:10.82]I've already gone through and looked at a few things, and we'll touch upon them in just a matter of mere minutes.
[01:20.43]So give me one second.
[01:22.03]I want to grab another coaster, so give me one second.
[01:24.55]Be right back.
[02:09.46]Okay.
[02:11.20]So... If we take a look at the box, I'm going to show the box now.
[02:16.44]Because I want to be able to trickle in, because this stream is a fairly special stream.
[02:21.11]We're not going to be doing this that often, so... And by often, I mean... We're going until this is done.
[02:27.45]I'm going to play every single one.
[02:31.40]Like last time.
[02:34.07]If there's 700,000 games, and I play each one for five minutes, that's seven, 1.4 million, two, three, four, I got, that's, you're talking about probably three or four years of this stream is going to be.
[02:48.09]So, this is probably going to be three year, 20, a 24 hour, three year long stream.
[02:59.74]So I'll see you guys when I'm like 40, and we get to the last one.
[03:05.29]So, without further ado, why don't we go like this?
[03:10.97]And why don't we go like this?
[03:15.97]Hi.
[03:17.61]So here it is.
[03:18.81]700,000 games, version 2.0.
[03:20.34]One of the things you're probably noticing right off the bat is the fact that the price tag has been scratched off.
[03:29.38]I didn't do that.
[03:30.70]It came like this.
[03:32.18]And as we all know, there are only two reasons why you do that.
[03:35.18]Either one, the gift was so cheap that you desperately don't want the person to know that it was a piece of shit, or you're embarrassed because the gift was too expensive.
[03:46.21]And I wonder which one this is.
[03:50.05]Scratch off that price tag!
[03:52.61]It's a gift.
[03:53.58]I don't want you to know how much this was.
[03:58.04]Both.
[03:59.55]Now, can you... No, I don't know.
[04:00.65]Maybe the company is embarrassed that this was like $11 on Amazon, wherever the hell it is.
[04:07.54]But, yeah.
[04:09.04]Here you go.
[04:09.30]I'll give you a close-up.
[04:12.66]That's... You see Pyramid Escape up there.
[04:14.68]Can't wait for that one.
[04:16.99]Mini Golf 3D Mania.
[04:18.95]Something interesting to know about 3D Golf Mini Mania.
[04:21.96]There's a thousand and one Mini Golf Mania levels, which is included in a game.
[04:26.36]So that's a thousand and one different games.
[04:28.74]They're using a weird semantic literal definition.
[04:32.30]And oddly enough, that took about 40 minutes to install.
[04:38.27]Something else that's kind of funny about this, before we get started, is I did open some of these.
[04:45.01]And why don't we just... I'll just show you.
[04:52.30]This is the same exact thing as the last one.
[04:55.56]Here's the difference.
[04:57.72]Take a look.
[04:58.52]Here are all of them.
[05:02.25]So you see, those of you that watched the last video that I did on the first version, I had a lot of problems not being able to open a lot of these.
[05:11.85]So what this actually is, this is not 700,000 games 2.
[05:14.86]This is 700,000 games, but this time, a bunch of them work.
[05:21.66]This is a patch.
[05:23.48]They patched in the ability to open half the games you couldn't open last time.
[05:34.91]Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
[05:37.69]Take a look.
[05:40.60]We got Hidden Objects, Arcade Games, Brick Buster Games, Time Management Games, Marble Popper, Cards, Sports, Match 3, Puzzles.
[05:51.56]Look at all these boring, terrible games that make up 699,990 of everything that's included on the one disc.
[06:04.88]So yeah, that's pretty much the long and short of it.
[06:07.64]So what we're gonna do is we're gonna do a little system here.
[06:11.74]So I'm gonna change this to this.
[06:14.78]I thought about turning on smart click.
[06:20.86]There is no way smart click is going to work.
[06:24.70]You guys are gonna have to like pick a quadrant if I turn on smart click.
[06:28.79]There's no way.
[06:29.97]We will never choose a game.
[06:31.41]So we're just gonna start.
[06:33.98]We'll do smart click for like an encore at the end.
[06:40.43]Pick quadrant, then game.
[06:45.53]Smart click.
[06:46.59]I'm just curious of how awful this would be.
[06:49.12]So hold on, give me one second.
[06:51.28]Let me change to this.
[06:52.22]I gotta get, where is it?
[06:53.52]Right there.
[06:55.44]It's copy.
[06:57.48]So I can make sure I have that on.
[07:00.60]Over here.
[07:02.26]I'm just curious at how awful this would be if I tried this.
[07:10.98]Okay, so without further ado, if we'd like to see how this is gonna work.
[07:20.37]First I have to turn it on.
[07:21.09]You're gonna have to refresh your page, I think.
[07:28.47]Okay, it is now active.
[07:30.64]And now I just have to go to it and turn it on.
[07:33.90]So you're going to have to probably, if your extension's not there, let's just see what happens.
[07:41.86]Alright.
[07:45.23]Super Frog is where everybody, it's actually working fairly well.
[07:50.63]This is not working terribly.
[07:51.99]This works actually pretty well.
[07:53.99]I thought it was going to be a disaster.
[07:58.54]So, we're starting with Super Frog?
[08:00.78]Is that what this is?
[08:04.32]I'm surprised this works as well as it does.
[08:05.93]Wow, I'm shocked.
[08:10.31]God.
[08:10.63]I need to move that over here, though.
[08:17.82]There we go.
[08:19.66]So, it looks like we're going to start with a classic video game by the name of... by the name of Super Frog.
[08:27.44]So, thank you for your participation in this.
[08:31.57]By the way, need to make one more thing very clear.
[08:35.57]RIP to the whole stream.
[08:38.29]Rip the VOD.
[08:39.69]Because we're going to be playing Landmines.
[08:43.06]Some of these are going to crash the entire computer and I'm going to have to restart my PC.
[08:47.36]So good luck.
[08:48.68]Please don't, let's not click on the landmine.
[08:53.32]Just through opening and closing certain ones.
[08:55.44]Oh, this is going to be a disaster.
[08:57.16]Welcome to the stream.
[08:59.86]Here we go.
[09:01.20]Let's go ahead and open Super Frog.
[09:04.37]Let's get some nostalgia here.
[09:07.77]So I'm going to go away because I don't want my face on the screen here.
[09:12.37]But what I do want is Super Frog!
[09:17.93]Yes, that's my desktop background.
[09:19.45]And by the way, I have lowered the volume by like 50% and it's still going to be awful.
[09:25.11]And you might not even be able to see anything.
[09:27.15]Super Frog!
[09:27.81]Alright, this is important.
[09:31.11]I don't think I should do that.
[09:31.82]That's a risky click.
[09:40.03]You know what I mean?
[09:40.75]Whoa, hold on a minute here.
[09:41.93]Risky click.
[09:50.51]Uh-oh.
[09:52.53]Come on.
[09:55.03]Come on.
[09:56.59]Oh, alright, here it comes.
[09:58.01]Look at how small this is.
[10:00.21]I have to make this better.
[10:01.20]Hold on.
[10:05.66]I knew I was gonna have to do this like a shitload of times.
[10:12.62]And it's so loud.
[10:14.40]How does it know my name?
[10:15.31]How does it know my name?
[10:19.17]I didn't click this, I promise.
[10:20.37]I didn't open this.
[10:22.25]I wa- I fucking promise I did not open this game.
[10:29.04]Is it window?
[10:29.92]Hold on.
[10:32.24]Can you hear me?
[10:34.50]Alright, full screen.
[10:35.88]Throw bubble up?
[10:37.22]Jump?
[10:37.62]Okay, we're good.
[10:38.90]I can't wait, I'm so ready for Super Brock.
[10:42.64]What a developer Easter egg.
[10:43.90]Yeah.
[10:46.82]Okay.
[10:47.84]Here we go.
[10:48.38]Time to play Super Frog.
[10:54.52]You only got a taste last time of what this game was like.
[10:57.06]I had to play through at least 20 minutes.
[11:01.45]There it is.
[11:02.53]Version 2.
[11:03.29]Wait, you can't even see this part.
[11:04.43]Let me move that.
[11:11.23]Yeah, we're gonna have a lot of fun called... Every game is gonna open in a strange window and I'm gonna have to resize them.
[11:20.16]Because I can't resize them on the desktop.
[11:24.84]That's... There we go.
[11:25.70]Alright, collect all the flowers, use the left and right arrow keys to move in the appropriate direction to jump.
[11:32.33]Press the up arrow key to collect the flowers in the middle of the screen.
[11:35.73]Reach the highest platform and then jump off of it to the lower platforms using the arrow keys.
[11:46.45]Desktop background.
[11:50.21]What is that?
[11:52.25]I got 500 candies!
[11:56.21]Hey, welcome to the reference stream.
[11:58.67]Where I'm just gonna make a bunch of fucking references the whole time.
[12:05.70]Is this a different level?
[12:10.32]I thought it was candies, not flowers.
[12:20.04]What the hell was that thing?
[12:22.60]This is the best song.
[12:24.22]You know, people are like, oh, put it on an OST.
[12:26.72]This is the one that I want to listen to.
[12:32.18]Had to get the banana.
[12:33.95]There's no double jump, just in case you're curious.
[12:38.35]Just in case you're curious.
[12:41.87]To enclose a monster in a bubble to trap it, and then press the space bar to send it flying.
[12:45.97]So it's like, bubble, bubble.
[12:53.51]How long should I spend on each one of these?
[12:55.69]There's 700,000 of these guys, remember!
[12:59.53]What just happened?
[13:02.15]I thought I put them in the bubble.
[13:03.09]I have to pop the bubble.
[13:04.09]Oh.
[13:04.97]Right.
[13:12.83]What if I only played Super Frog?
[13:16.20]Would you guys be mad?
[13:31.60]No, you guys wouldn't be mad if I only did super wrong.
[13:38.88]I did it, right?
[13:39.86]Oh, wait, the flowers regrow.
[13:41.36]Oh, that's fucking... Oh!
[13:46.45]Here are the candies!
[13:48.19]Wait, is that... Package it up!
[13:50.87]Oh!
[13:55.11]Fuck.
[14:01.34]I'm beating the whole game.
[14:03.38]Restart.
[14:04.24]No, I'll get them again.
[14:04.94]Don't worry.
[14:05.80]I'll say the line.
[14:06.72]Don't worry.
[14:10.52]I'm not going to say the line?
[14:18.67]Say the line.
[14:19.43]Say the line.
[14:28.96]I should probably turn off the desktop background, just make it like a black screen, right?
[14:37.18]That's pretty quick.
[14:38.28]How many more do I have to do?
[14:39.62]Hold on, I'll see if I can get it how fast I can get this.
[14:43.28]Frog tech!
[14:58.29]Don't you wish this guy had his own Nintendo video game?
[15:01.05]Well, he already did.
[15:01.67]It's called Gex.
[15:05.06]Enter the Gecko, right?
[15:08.22]Am I not doing it fast enough?
[15:16.34]I want him in Smash.
[15:19.28]Monster Cleaner.
[15:20.14]What's going on?
[15:20.86]How do I beat this level?
[15:23.29]The fucking flowers.
[15:25.67]Because they're eating the flowers.
[15:27.11]I get it.
[15:29.01]That's a mechanic.
[15:30.05]Guys, I've only played this game for like fucking four minutes.
[15:33.39]How?
[15:33.67]I don't know that.
[15:34.31]Oh, hold on a minute.
[15:39.60]Quick, zoom in.
[15:41.32]I didn't.
[15:41.74]Hold on.
[15:43.56]See?
[15:44.02]Reference.
[15:44.32]That's the line that made me famous.
[15:52.83]That's where all of my fame comes from.
[15:54.41]I said that one time.
[15:58.55]Now I tour college campuses.
[16:01.69]I've written a couple of books.
[16:02.74]100 points?
[16:15.12]At what point do I give up on this one?
[16:21.16]You never finished that book.
[16:22.42]Yeah, but I still read it.
[16:24.60]If I don't get all of these right now, I'm putting a hole in my monitor.
[16:35.08]What's going on?
[16:38.81]Okay, I did it.
[16:47.41]It's the same thing over and over.
[16:51.05]What are these, missiles?
[16:53.19]Why didn't missiles drop?
[16:56.17]Okay, that... strange reference.
[17:02.10]This is a reference stream.
[17:04.26]That's just the... Papers, Please noise that the guy makes when you click on the thing.
[17:11.94]T for Teen?
[17:16.23]Actually, there's blood in this game.
[17:17.51]Not this one, but in this package.
[17:24.17]Alright, that's it.
[17:25.39]I've been on Super Frog for like 10 straight minutes.
[17:27.89]We have a long way to go.
[17:29.50]We had to open it up strong.
[17:31.66]Very strong.
[17:35.38]Don't more keep going.
[17:38.57]No, I'm sorry.
[17:39.51]We're getting out of Super Frog in about 15 minutes.
[17:44.51]I'll Frog Tech these guys one more time.
[17:54.06]But if you want, okay, hold on.
[17:55.74]We talk a lot of shit about this game and this product.
[18:00.50]But I really can't think of anything better that's more just completely benign than this game giving it to like a third grader.
[18:08.10]You know what I'm saying?
[18:11.69]This is just the same level over and over again where you just collect candies and you shoot bubbles out of your mouth.
[18:20.07]This is so... There's no content here.
[18:25.13]None.
[18:26.37]So, this is the best thing.
[18:30.81]For like a, okay, little Tim, you get ten minutes on the computer to play Super Frog, and they're gonna be like, oh, Super Frog!
[18:39.10]They don't give a shit, they don't even know what they're doing.
[18:40.58]They can barely talk.
[18:46.60]That's worth its weight in gold.
[18:48.72]As a parent.
[18:53.97]You don't even have to... If you're a good boy, then you get Captain Crunch.
[18:58.76]No, no, no.
[18:59.04]If you're a good boy, you get 10 minutes of Super Frog.
[19:00.92]And then you pretend like it's the greatest thing in the world.
[19:04.16]Make sure you get him catching you playing it.
[19:06.64]Like I am right now.
[19:08.20]He comes into the room.
[19:09.30]Dad?
[19:09.80]Yeah, what's up?
[19:10.72]Hey, son.
[19:11.54]Just playing some Super Frog.
[19:17.21]And then they don't even understand.
[19:18.21]Alright, that's enough Super Frog.
[19:23.12]Oh yeah, there are two new emotes, by the way.
[19:26.31]There's GermaOld, and then I turned GermaExpensive into GermaOneGuy.
[19:34.78]There will be a new GermaExpensive emote.
[19:37.60]Papers, please!
[19:38.24]Papers, papers, papers, papers, please!
[19:40.14]Ready?
[19:51.65]Holy shit.
[19:54.45]He's wearing a t-shirt that says F. What a terrible character design, but it makes it so good.
[20:08.68]I thought my computer just crashed.
[20:10.28]Uh, let me, okay, let me change the desktop background to black.
[20:13.78]So it is not, like, icy Game of Thrones shit in the background.
[20:17.78]This is not a Game of Thrones background.
[20:19.78]Just in case you were curious.
[20:22.06]It's not.
[20:22.40]Let's just change it.
[20:24.25]Personalize.
[20:26.45]Uh, change it to, uh, just a solid color.
[20:29.27]Ooh.
[20:30.27]Hey, look at that.
[20:33.79]Can you see?
[20:34.25]This is gonna, everyone, this is gonna freak everybody out so much.
[20:37.79]Check this out.
[20:44.11]This is live right now.
[20:45.19]This is happening.
[20:45.65]Alright, we need to cross off.
[20:49.92]Let's go back to that list.
[20:52.28]Oh, God.
[20:54.32]We can't do that again.
[20:55.74]We can't sit there and play Super Frog for 10 minutes.
[21:03.44]You know what I mean?
[21:04.62]We got to make this clear.
[21:06.04]So I need to add an X and just put it over that.
[21:18.70]Because if we are not going back to it, it's done.
[21:28.49]Super frog.
[21:29.27]I almost put it on the wrong thing.
[21:31.29]Super frog is done.
[21:38.71]Alright.
[21:40.56]Shall we pick another one?
[21:43.48]Let's pick another one.
[21:46.77]If you'd like to click, we're going to do this for the first little bit here.
[21:49.35]Click on where you'd like us to go next.
[21:56.90]I'm not going to fucking Super Frog again.
[22:00.94]I am actually really surprised at how well this is working.
[22:11.67]We're going to go from Super Frog to Super Fox.
[22:22.73]What did I expect?
[22:23.97]Yeah, alright, Super Fox.
[22:26.85]Thank you for participating.
[22:28.43]If you want to participate, all you have to do is click the screen.
[22:32.19]Uh, Super Fox it is.
[22:36.35]Good luck.
[22:40.14]Oh, this is a full screen game.
[22:41.60]Uh oh.
[22:44.90]I have no control.
[22:48.04]This is in the other one too.
[22:50.81]Is there any... Can you guys even see this?
[23:00.62]Oh, shit.
[23:01.28]Uh-oh.
[23:01.56]Hold on.
[23:06.61]Let's see if this works.
[23:09.71]Can you guys see this?
[23:13.87]Because this... I can't change this.
[23:21.34]Is it still just a black screen?
[23:24.47]Can you see this?
[23:29.51]What does it look like?
[23:30.17]It's small.
[23:38.52]I can't fix it.
[23:39.36]This is how it has to be.
[23:40.30]I can't fix it.
[23:44.90]I can't put this into a window.
[23:53.36]Zoom it out again?
[23:54.26]Oh lord, hold on.
[24:03.24]Some of these games are just gonna open.
[24:05.80]Let's see if that helps.
[24:07.96]It's gonna be like this.
[24:09.38]There's nothing I can do about it.
[24:10.60]Can you see?
[24:11.90]Just like look real close into your screen.
[24:18.35]Because what's happening is, it's changing my resolution across every screen.
[24:29.30]This is great.
[24:30.76]Close enough.
[24:33.10]So if you're gonna ride the alligator, you're gonna get chased by... I thought he had a dick for a second.
[24:38.10]I really did.
[24:38.56]It was like, holy shit, what the hell are they thinking?
[24:40.92]Here we go.
[24:45.01]Choose if you want to play single or with a friend.
[24:47.27]No, we're gonna play single.
[24:50.39]Pick two.
[24:51.75]Choose the level pick you'd want to play.
[24:53.27]Pick two, pick one.
[24:54.29]Uh, pick seven.
[25:03.31]You must reach the gate by jumping through the holes you can run through the edges of the screen.
[25:08.01]By using to move, escape to in-game pause ma- Alright, but- Again, I thought-
[25:20.09]I hope you guys can see this.
[25:21.95]Alright, so where am I?
[25:24.81]I just killed myself.
[25:26.89]How?
[25:28.99]I'm smashing my skull on the bottom.
[25:33.85]So this one has presents, and cheese, and gummy bear.
[25:38.27]Does that clip?
[25:39.79]There's fall damage.
[25:42.71]Is that killing me?
[25:44.81]Okay, I'm running out of lives.
[25:51.86]I just fucking smashed- How would- Why would you make a Super Mario game?
[25:56.12]Where you can hurt your head?
[26:06.26]No, I ain't typing that in.
[26:07.22]It's gonna go up to like some server somewhere.
[26:08.70]And they're gonna know me.
[26:14.97]Okay, that's out.
[26:15.51]That's it.
[26:16.37]Thanks for playing.
[26:19.91]That's it for super fucks.
[26:21.25]I'm not doing that one again.
[26:29.46]This is... That's not gonna happen.
[26:37.20]Where's... Where the fuck is it?
[26:40.98]So many on here.
[26:42.68]Okay.
[26:43.40]I'm not... No more super... Oh, damn it.
[26:46.07]Super... We've only done two.
[26:49.40]Oh god, I'm gonna be here.
[26:50.42]The first 24 hour stream.
[26:55.16]Is it gonna be this one?
[26:57.80]No, no, no.
[26:58.62]It's not.
[26:59.28]No way.
[27:00.78]Alright, let's do it again.
[27:01.68]Where would you like to go?
[27:04.06]Oh, you fucking pranksters.
[27:10.96]Super Frog to Super Fox to Super Fox 2.
[27:13.56]Okay.
[27:23.32]I might as well just go through and do all the supers.
[27:27.37]I'll just do them.
[27:28.49]Because they're just going to win every single thing.
[27:37.78]Alright, let's play Super Fox 2.
[27:45.86]Thank you for participating.
[27:51.22]Where the hell even is this?
[27:52.44]Which collection is this in?
[27:54.70]I knew this was gonna happen.
[27:58.38]Okay, I think it's coll- is it collection three?
[28:02.16]Yeah, okay.
[28:03.08]Super Fox... two.
[28:09.31]Tell me if you can see this.
[28:14.37]Oh god, it's doing it again.
[28:16.37]It's loading up the- it's fucking up the back, it's- wh- what's the difference?! !
[28:27.07]They just made it, they gave him a different shirt.
[28:29.31]Look at how fucking small this is.
[28:43.27]This is like, one of, I, a lot of them have.
[28:47.42]Actually this one is different.
[28:50.20]I wonder how closely you guys have to look right now.
[28:53.88]Chess or Trests?
[28:56.19]Hot air balloons?
[28:59.45]Because I can't make it window, and I can't get out.
[29:02.55]It's right now my monitor, my actual, all of the monitors are in like 640 by 480.
[29:08.11]Alright, look closely because I got a fucked up screen too.
[29:14.39]I thought the dick tiger was really, really happy that he killed like a bunch of people.
[29:19.17]I thought these were all like dead bodies lying around.
[29:20.75]I don't know why I went to that immediately, but that's what I thought it was.
[29:28.57]I thought he was, like, looking happy.
[29:35.79]Check the Nvidia control panel settings.
[29:39.94]Uh, well... What's happening is... It's... The same problem happened last time I played this.
[29:48.00]Where some of them just force you, it doesn't matter what you do.
[29:51.96]The game physically cannot turn on unless the monitor is at 640x480.
[29:57.27]Remember, these games were made in like fucking two hours each.
[30:02.19]What happened?
[30:06.53]And there's your case in point.
[30:09.41]This game took 42 minutes to make.
[30:12.13]And after that, we're out.
[30:12.93]Okay.
[30:19.74]Well, that was fun.
[30:24.40]And I'm just gonna get it out of the way.
[30:27.90]Because... Oh, Jesus, this is still on.
[30:32.20]I'm going to open up Super Mole right now.
[30:39.51]Yes, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[30:45.31]I know that the mole is the next one that you want to see.
[30:49.21]I'm certain of it.
[30:54.22]How is this one?
[30:55.64]Oh god, all the ones that are Super Mole and Super Fox, they all do the same thing!
[30:59.58]God damn it!
[31:03.67]You don't have... No options to...
[31:24.91]It's not bad?
[31:26.65]It's not that bad?
[31:31.03]What the fuck is this?
[31:32.43]What am I supposed to do?
[31:44.58]What?
[31:45.60]Mole movement, use current weapon, switch weapons.
[31:49.85]This is not like the other Super G- I don't like this, it's different.
[31:52.29]I don't like this.
[31:54.30]The developers decided to go into like a gem hunting Spelunky way.
[31:57.16]I don't like it.
[31:58.06]I want the old Super games.
[31:59.36]Alright, it's weapon hotkeys.
[32:03.87]Get rid of panels.
[32:05.39]Suicide.
[32:06.01]Suicide.
[32:22.93]Didn't even give himself a chance.
[32:24.89]Where are you getting those grenades?
[32:30.39]This game already exists.
[32:31.31]What's it called?
[32:32.39]Uh, Dig Dug.
[32:35.71]Oh, there's a grenade.
[32:38.53]Smell it?
[32:39.01]Smell it?
[32:44.00]Wait, wait, wait!
[32:44.44]They're gonna crush me.
[32:45.42]Okay, watch out.
[32:46.04]Don't get crushed!
[32:46.60]Uh oh, I just checkmated myself.
[32:57.28]Fucking 900 million IQ.
[33:05.26]I like this one.
[33:06.80]I just got like a nuke.
[33:08.82]What the fuck?
[33:12.32]Oh shit, I have... Wait, I have like bombs, TNT.
[33:17.53]What is this one?
[33:18.81]Is it a mine?
[33:21.27]Drink poison.
[33:22.07]I just drank poison.
[33:24.05]Holy shit.
[33:25.01]Okay, it's like a Pac-Man power cube.
[33:49.12]I like this one.
[33:49.66]This one's actually kind of fucking cool.
[33:55.30]Enemies, there's no enemies left to destroy.
[33:56.92]It's not exciting, but this is a good game, yeah.
[34:04.19]You don't die from that, good.
[34:05.69]Oh, I have a health meter.
[34:07.03]Sick!
[34:10.91]There's actual thought in this one.
[34:22.11]That was fun.
[34:25.53]Alright, this is where it derails.
[34:30.90]How long has it been?
[34:31.88]Because that's the first one that I think is still open in the task manager.
[34:38.00]And if I close it, it might kill the whole computer.
[34:47.06]Why?
[34:49.93]No, I think we're fine.
[34:50.83]No, we're good.
[34:51.71]No, we're good.
[34:52.11]We're good.
[34:52.35]We're good.
[34:52.59]We're good.
[34:52.85]Everything's fine.
[34:53.49]Right?
[34:53.87]I can still change scenes.
[34:54.77]Oh, we're golden.
[34:58.34]Let's go ahead and get that over Super Mole.
[35:04.38]And then we had Super Fox 2, right?
[35:10.50]Super Fox 2 was down here.
[35:15.28]And we've played four games.
[35:19.77]Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
[35:24.30]Alright.
[35:25.28]So, where would you like to go next?
[35:28.74]Oh, wonderful, lovely audience of mine.
[35:43.51]We're in this together.
[35:44.37]Oh, yes, we are.
[35:47.13]I'm seeing a lot of...
[35:50.39]It's more, now that there's no more super in the title, seem to be pretty evenly split, except for fish food, which is the next one we're going to play.
[36:01.68]So, let's go ahead and open up fish food.
[36:05.55]Hopefully this one has even a full screen graphic option.
[36:10.33]That would be very nice.
[36:16.24]Now I get to do the fun task of finding where the fuck that game is.
[36:20.16]Okay, found it.
[36:22.44]Fish food, let's go!
[36:23.12]If you think this is going to be even remotely close to Insane Aquarium, you are so wrong that it's actually making me angry.
[36:35.74]Let's do it.
[36:40.30]Yes!
[36:41.22]Yes!
[36:41.72]Thank God!
[36:43.69]What?
[36:47.44]Why would you have a maximize window if it doesn't do anything?
[36:51.79]Oh my fucking god.
[36:57.47]It just increases the window.
[37:03.10]When did this come out?
[37:04.68]Hold on a minute.
[37:05.38]Let's be fucking serious for one second.
[37:08.84]When did this come out?
[37:11.88]Okay, this is designed for Windows 7 and Windows 8.
[37:16.44]Why would you have a 640 by 480 window in like 2013?
[37:19.93]Did you just hit the pinnacle of where you are able to design a video game and you just don't even attempt to go any further?
[37:35.16]This game came out probably in like, did this come out this year?
[37:38.30]What's the copyright on it? 2014.
[37:43.82]And you're still making fucking 640 by 480 windows.
[37:46.96]You can't, like, fix this?
[37:49.12]Well, I'll try.
[37:50.98]What the hell is Muzon?
[37:56.67]What's this fucked up weird, like, out of the scene in Adobe Flash Easter egg?
[38:14.77]Amazon affiliate link.
[38:17.41]Alright, fuck it, let's go.
[38:21.67]How to play.
[38:23.13]Meet Sunny, a small- See, you guys have it easy, I got it hard.
[38:26.31]Because I have to look at the fucking screen.
[38:28.45]That is... under a microscope.
[38:32.21]Vast ocean.
[38:32.87]Use your mouse to help Sunny survive in these dangerous waters.
[38:35.91]Follow these rules.
[38:36.71]Eat the fish smaller than yourself.
[38:38.37]Avoid the fish bigger than yourself.
[38:39.67]Eat enough fish to grow up.
[38:45.05]That's an overworld.
[38:46.99]Meet Sunny.
[38:47.63]Look at this.
[38:51.59]Alright.
[38:52.45]Fish Frenzy has more levels than Donkey Kong Country.
[38:55.81]Something's wrong there.
[38:56.68]Did I already eat something?
[39:00.88]And you got the mouse on the screen too.
[39:02.18]Alright.
[39:03.08]You got me so far.
[39:04.94]I can eat these guys?
[39:20.37]I'm gonna get gnomed.
[39:21.27]No, I'm not gonna get gnomed.
[39:24.37]This was so easy.
[39:25.31]This is level one though.
[39:30.89]How would I get gnomed in this?
[39:32.03]The gnome didn't even exist until like 16 months ago.
[39:37.17]I don't know why I'm referring to the gnome in baby years, like how old a baby is.
[39:45.25]Golden fish.
[39:49.89]No, no.
[39:51.11]I just got gnomed.
[39:53.05]It just happened.
[39:53.51]You just saw it on the screen.
[39:54.25]I just got fucking gnomed.
[39:59.61]Alright, let's speedrun this.
[40:03.40]I wonder how far I can get before I'm fucking raging.
[40:08.62]Oh, he's gonna rage!
[40:11.10]Hey, place your bets, guys!
[40:12.90]When's it gonna rage?! !
[40:27.39]This is not what I thought the game was going to be like.
[40:29.05]I kind of need to see.
[40:29.75]Wait a minute.
[40:35.44]Wait a minute.
[40:37.20]What's with all this stuff?
[40:41.14]Toxic waste dump.
[40:42.86]What's with the bomb over here?
[40:46.55]Am I going to get to choose two different paths?
[40:57.75]I'm going through toxic waste, die by a whale, or, like, nuclear explosion.
[41:05.86]This is... This is more... Oh, wow, we got big guys.
[41:09.14]We got big guys.
[41:11.58]He can grow, too.
[41:13.58]God, this just reminds me of BBB so much, you know what I mean?
[41:17.84]I'm getting some real... Like, it's itchy.
[41:19.84]I'm getting those real BBB vibes.
[41:21.98]Uh-oh, easy.
[41:25.78]Don't know me.
[41:26.42]Don't know me.
[41:27.28]We're going with first death?
[41:40.61]Game over.
[41:41.11]Hope you guys are aware of that.
[41:43.51]Can I beat this whole game in one sitting without dying once?
[41:49.49]Permanent death.
[41:54.80]This is going to be so long.
[41:57.84]I want to see what happens when we get to the nuke.
[42:03.42]The difficulty is going to ramp up.
[42:04.74]They don't want anyone completing the game.
[42:06.06]Because guess what?
[42:07.35]There is no completing the game.
[42:08.51]After level 16, there's nothing there.
[42:10.61]That's just there to be a liar.
[42:12.01]That didn't count.
[42:13.35]I'm alive.
[42:16.40]They didn't develop past, like, level 12.
[42:19.78]That map is not going to work after 12 levels.
[42:22.36]I guarantee it.
[42:24.52]Guaranteed.
[42:30.19]You see that needle threat right there?
[42:31.43]Nobody, none of you, nobody in this chat could do that.
[42:46.01]I'm surprised nobody's made the joke in this chat yet.
[42:50.02]It's pretty easy.
[42:51.58]First game that Jeremy's been able to get S-ranking on.
[42:55.14]Right?
[42:55.68]Where's that?
[42:56.49]I haven't seen that yet.
[42:57.35]Go.
[43:15.75]You just gotta, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna speed this process up.
[43:19.38]Come on, I can do this quick.
[43:20.90]He ate them all, that's not fair.
[43:26.46]Get outta here.
[43:56.98]GDQ run.
[43:58.50]Doesn't matter.
[44:00.22]Yeah, it does.
[44:00.94]I'm about to escape.
[44:03.92]This game is actually... I don't know why that hurt my back, but it did.
[44:06.92]Just don't touch a whale and I'm good.
[44:11.42]Oh, what a perfect use of that emote.
[44:12.85]Yeah.
[44:13.17]I forgot.
[44:29.69]I'm losing growth is what's happening.
[44:31.37]Alright, that's enough.
[44:32.01]I'm done.
[44:32.33]We're going to be sitting here for so long.
[44:38.16]Get to the toxic waste or riot.
[44:39.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[44:41.90]That's 11 more levels.
[44:51.55]Yeah, that is actually kind of funny.
[44:54.27]There's two endings to the game.
[44:55.98]One where I become a gigantic fish and I win, and the other one where a nuke goes off.
[45:03.78]Very interesting stuff.
[45:04.86]I'm not gonna win, I'm gonna lose here.
[45:24.71]That just... That was the button to click to add like two minutes to this game.
[45:34.07]Thank God.
[45:34.61]Because that music was going to be the reason to hit escape.
[45:52.88]No, that's it.
[45:53.38]I'm done.
[45:54.99]I can't leave the game.
[45:55.69]How do I leave?
[45:56.17]I think I have to just click the X. No escape.
[46:08.36]I probably have to beat the level to go to the menu.
[46:11.49]It's not even going to be toxic waste.
[46:13.13]It's just a thing on the map that somebody drew and put there.
[46:16.53]Haven't you ever played a game...
[46:21.18]Have you guys ever played a game before?
[46:23.22]Have any of you guys ever played a game?
[46:26.25]Where there's an overworld?
[46:30.93]Ah!
[46:31.49]What?
[46:31.69]Yeah, it's a phone game.
[46:36.99]In Candy Crush, you do the same thing over and over and over again, and then you walk by the clown with the funny pink hair.
[46:44.07]And there's no clown.
[46:45.47]There's mines here, though.
[46:48.77]Well, this was fun.
[46:49.83]This was a fun one.
[46:58.09]What am I talking about?
[46:58.79]Look, these are mines!
[47:10.58]You're already halfway to the waste.
[47:13.56]They're the same four enemies.
[47:19.62]We're not gonna even get to see a new enemy type.
[47:25.14]It's the same SpongeBob fish.
[47:29.12]It's over.
[47:31.50]I was trying to circle that guy and I forgot.
[47:34.10]There's that one.
[47:39.10]That was Super Fish.
[47:41.38]What the fuck was that one even called?
[47:44.56]I don't know.
[47:45.62]That one was called Fish Food.
[47:50.30]And it is now over.
[47:56.48]Where are we going?
[48:04.62]See, now it's split.
[48:05.76]This is gonna be... I'm gonna have to sit here for a minute or two.
[48:07.52]Because this shit is locked down.
[48:16.09]All of you fucking guys clicking on Feeding Frenzy that want to see the same game again, but this time the fish is green instead of yellow.
[48:32.47]Spy Chaser.
[48:33.19]This one's probably... I think I remember this one.
[48:35.71]This one's 3D.
[48:38.75]We're going Spy Chaser.
[48:45.76]Yeah, this is a 3D game, which means it's probably gonna fucking crash the computer.
[48:49.20]This might be the first landmine of the evening.
[48:52.08]So, I'll be right back if it crashes.
[48:55.68]Thanks for voting.
[48:58.46]And where is it?
[48:59.44]Spy Chasers.
[49:00.70]It's Pack 2, I believe.
[49:05.70]Spy Chasers.
[49:06.64]Okay.
[49:10.02]Is that not it?
[49:12.25]No, it is.
[49:14.17]What the fuck is it?
[49:16.27]Spy Chasers.
[49:17.97]There it is.
[49:18.43]Alright, here we go.
[49:19.87]Good luck.
[49:21.11]See ya.
[49:21.79]See ya maybe in like a minute when my computer blue screens.
[49:31.35]Huh?
[49:35.90]Are we good?
[49:36.32]Uh oh.
[49:49.55]Is it open?
[50:09.25]That was Spy Chaser.
[50:13.70]Pretty good.
[50:14.76]Pretty fun.
[50:19.34]Where we going next?
[50:29.27]I thought they fixed all these.
[50:30.73]Alright, somebody keep, somebody jot it down.
[50:37.28]Somebody keep a mental note somewhere of the ones that didn't work.
[50:41.38]I guess I could just do that.
[50:42.80]I have a monitor right here.
[50:48.74]So, because I want to see if I can go into like the fucking game like INI files or something and try to like force that to open.
[50:57.87]Okay, SpyChaser was one of them.
[51:01.33]Just write it on the monitor.
[51:07.17]I could just do that, right?
[51:10.81]Just have like, but no, I can't.
[51:16.96]No, there's no reason for that.
[51:18.16]I could just write it here.
[51:19.06]Alright, looks like we're going feeding frenzy.
[51:28.26]Let me click on monster doors.
[51:30.68]Is it too far over?
[51:35.44]Let me click monster doors.
[51:37.12]What are you doing?
[51:39.42]What the fuck?
[51:40.83]Fuck.
[51:43.51]It's cool.
[51:43.91]I told you.
[51:44.35]Dutch made that cool again.
[51:45.75]To be able to voice crack.
[51:47.69]It used to be not cool.
[51:58.17]Alright.
[51:58.95]We're going to feeding frenzy.
[52:00.87]I can't wait.
[52:03.27]Looking forward to it.
[52:12.34]Yes, I'm sure.
[52:13.64]I'm sure I want you to open this.
[52:16.30]Are you sure you want to open that file?
[52:18.20]I guess.
[52:20.86]Here we go.
[52:23.67]Well, this one opens.
[52:34.40]That's Harley Quinn without any makeup on.
[52:37.42]Options.
[52:37.92]Wait, what?
[52:42.18]This is, this is the one where you, this is the, this is the fast one.
[52:49.00]But it's so small in the corner.
[52:53.06]Wait, wait, wait.
[52:53.84]I might be able to fix this a little bit.
[52:58.10]Let me see if I can fix this.
[53:02.98]If I go like this and then move it down like that, you guys are going to have to tell me if this helps at all.
[53:09.08]Because there's no way I'm going to be able to know.
[53:17.35]It kinda did, right?
[53:24.40]Alright.
[53:27.36]So, game speed, yeah, as fast as possible.
[53:31.34]And here's the thing, I did this on a different computer that time.
[53:35.68]Is this supposed to be Ash?
[53:48.33]Alright, here we go.
[53:49.27]Go fishing.
[53:50.47]Oh god, it's going to do it.
[53:51.49]I know it.
[53:52.09]But I'm at like probably 3,000 frames a second.
[53:59.30]Oh my god, it just crashed.
[54:02.20]What the fuck is happening?
[54:08.64]What?
[54:10.44]No!
[54:11.34]Why?
[54:11.82]No!
[54:20.98]What the hell was that for?
[54:24.89]There's no reason for that!
[54:26.43]No, it's doing it!
[54:37.34]I can- Jesus!
[54:49.46]This collection came out in 2014.
[54:50.82]That was not like three decades ago.
[54:54.56]Oh my God.
[54:58.09]Why?
[55:24.71]My head hurts.
[55:30.67]This is supposed to be version 2.
[55:34.39]How is that version 2?
[55:36.49]Somebody just dragged and dropped... a folder into a new folder and named it 2.
[55:49.02]And then sneezed in the thumb drive.
[55:55.10]My God.
[55:56.44]Okay.
[55:57.72]I'm going to write that one down too.
[56:01.38]So feeding frenzy also didn't fucking do anything.
[56:05.08]Well, it did do something.
[56:06.62]It turned on a Halloween strobe light into almost 6,000 people's faces.
[56:13.12]Can you imagine how fucked up that is?
[56:15.86]What I have just done on this stream.
[56:20.67]There is a stadium here full of people.
[56:23.73]That I just flashed.
[56:33.29]And then I walked off the stage.
[56:40.74]I think people are trying to click down on monster doors.
[56:44.82]But maybe they can't.
[56:51.53]Is everybody like, alright, I'm actually concerned about that.
[56:55.51]How would I ever know that opening Feeding Frenzy was going to... What the fuck is this, Big Frenzy?
[57:07.01]From now on, here on out, I'm just going to flash myself, okay?
[57:12.45]So I'm not going to change over to the game until I'm certain that it looks alright.
[57:19.45]Wait a minute, hold on.
[57:20.51]Okay, Big Frenzy.
[57:23.09]So, Big Frenzy looks like it's going to be the one that wins.
[57:27.09]50%.
[57:27.13]Thank you for voting.
[57:34.10]Okay.
[57:35.04]Big Frenzy.
[57:35.90]This one is in Best Video Game Hits 4.
[57:40.12]Big Frenzy.
[57:41.34]I'm not changing this over yet.
[57:43.92]Well, I am actually for a second because I need to.
[57:47.27]So, hold on.
[57:49.47]I feel like the camera being on takes us into another dimension.
[57:53.64]We're already in a fucked up dimension.
[57:55.06]I'm bringing you back to reality for a second.
[57:56.96]So just hold on.
[58:01.70]I'm still in pain from that flash.
[58:04.25]That's the fucking worst thing I've ever seen.
[58:07.75]Alright.
[58:09.63]Let's make sure this is actually going to be captured.
[58:18.44]Okay.
[58:20.67]Big Frenzy.
[58:24.69]Please.
[58:26.31]Please just spare us.
[58:28.06]Spare me, because I'm the one that's looking at it right now.
[58:33.22]Alright.
[58:35.54]Okay, this has video options.
[58:51.91]I can't make the screen bigger.
[59:16.24]That should make it a little better.
[59:18.56]Come on back to me, bug.
[59:20.74]Bug man.
[59:21.34]What about bug frenzy?
[59:25.13]It's a little better.
[59:28.51]Holy shit, this is fucked up.
[59:30.61]This is not right.
[59:31.31]This is not right.
[59:33.29]I don't know why this happened.
[59:37.99]It just reached into the fucking computer screen through and like choked me.
[59:42.88]It fucking crashed.
[59:46.98]I actually got strangled by that game.
[59:56.30]Okay, looks a little better.
[59:59.95]Could be better though.
[60:00.61]That's as good as it's gonna get.
[60:08.87]Start.
[60:14.42]It was night time, a firefly flew around the garden collecting glowing eggs.
[60:22.50]Why is this written in shitty chalk?
[60:26.04]Okay.
[60:27.44]Is that what the bug did?
[60:40.92]Am I dead?
[60:42.84]That was actually kind of brutal.
[60:58.14]Okay.
[60:59.34]We'll try it again.
[61:07.63]I'm going to try to get every single Crunch Berry.
[61:13.07]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[61:15.35]That's a song.
[61:15.87]What popular song is that?
[61:19.83]Again and again and again and again and again.
[61:24.83]What is it?
[61:25.39]Oh my god!
[61:26.10]It's gonna... It's... It just strangled me!
[61:34.14]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[61:46.40]Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[61:47.78]No, no, this is not the top one most embarrassing stream.
[61:53.38]What am I doing?
[61:55.12]Oh my god, I'm so quirky!
[61:59.64]Right?
[61:59.92]I did it.
[62:16.33]So we do it again.
[62:16.81]I'm not stopping until somebody puts in the chat what this song is or what interlude this is.
[62:37.85]No, it's not again and again it's You and then you and for you and for you and for you and for is wrong.
[62:46.63]What am I doing?
[62:47.19]Is that wrong?
[63:00.54]I Got a feeling
[63:03.30]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[63:06.44]No, it's not.
[63:12.79]What's this thing do?
[63:41.13]Oh!
[63:42.11]I have another life.
[63:49.52]I was gonna... How many more is this?
[63:59.31]Last one?
[64:00.41]Only, like, one more little quadrant up here.
[64:03.47]And then we can finally get this shit going.
[64:12.14]Get me the fuck out of this.
[64:20.99]That was... I don't even know what that was.
[64:25.33]I forget what that was already.
[64:26.47]That was... Bug Frenzy?
[64:29.68]Where the hell is it?
[64:30.98]There it is.
[64:34.48]Well, it's been an hour.
[64:38.49]That was Bug Fuck?
[64:40.83]I don't think the title of that game was Bug Fuck.
[64:45.27]I'm pretty sure it was Bug Frenzy.
[64:48.99]Alright, uh, where are we going now?
[64:51.67]I know you can't click on the bottom of the screen, but I'm sorry, there's not much I can do about it.
[64:56.34]These are like five separate images that I had to staple together.
[65:07.66]never has no one ever it's never have no one ever by the smiths what alright I don't know if this is gerbil quest or monster doors so I'm I'm gonna say it's gerbil quest let's open up gerbil quest
[65:44.19]Again, all these fucking things.
[65:46.07]I just wish... Here's the worst part.
[65:49.78]Going through this the first time.
[65:51.10]Like, I could, like, set up the capture again.
[65:54.98]I could change the window.
[65:56.20]I'm gonna burp real loud.
[65:57.56]No, I'm not.
[65:58.88]Okay.
[66:01.36]Here we go.
[66:02.17]Jerp.
[66:02.45]No!
[66:02.77]I'm gonna turn it off because I don't want you to see this because what if it's a fucking flash?
[66:10.01]Oh.
[66:14.10]Did DurableQuest not open?
[66:23.38]Trying to.
[66:23.84]Write it down.
[66:40.89]DurableQuest does not open.
[66:45.08]So that's spy chaser feeding frenzy gerbil quest.
[66:51.87]See if we can get this to open later for the encore part of the stream.
[66:56.85]Looks like everyone wants monster doors because you can't go any lower.
[67:01.69]Monster doors or we riot.
[67:04.80]You're going to get your monster door or it might be a landmine.
[67:10.02]Monster door incoming.
[67:18.12]Let's try it.
[67:20.92]Monster door.
[67:26.02]We're good.
[67:28.06]No, we're not.
[67:28.56]It's a landmine.
[67:29.30]Fuck!
[67:29.64]It's a landmine!
[67:30.62]No, it's not.
[67:31.46]Thank goodness!
[67:41.21]I'm scared to do that.
[67:45.53]No, we ain't doing that.
[67:46.67]No way.
[67:55.31]Do you think I'm gonna fullscreen that game?
[67:56.61]It'll fucking mon- Dad, talk about a door I don't want to open.
[67:59.49]That one.
[67:59.85]Alright, it's off-center.
[68:02.77]Someone's gonna be like, It's off-center-ree!
[68:04.79]It's off-center-ree!
[68:06.00]Right?
[68:06.28]Someone's gonna do that.
[68:06.84]I know someone's gonna write that.
[68:10.02]Okay, we're good.
[68:16.66]That's an exponential increase.
[68:18.14]Alright, are you ready?
[68:20.78]Monster doors.
[68:25.96]Classic original puzzle with one figure to collect.
[68:28.42]Two by two.
[68:29.84]Every fourth level you'll get a new figure to collect.
[68:32.60]I don't know what that means.
[68:37.71]Level one.
[68:38.21]Points to pass at level 160.
[68:42.85]Collect figures.
[68:45.65]Monsters of... It's Jester's bonus figure.

[69:37.60]Jackpot!
[69:53.41]I need a green down here.
[69:56.90]Got it.

[70:04.42]Bingo.
[70:08.53]Oh no.
[70:08.93]That's not gonna happen.
[70:12.99]Uh.
[70:18.23]How the hell am I supposed to set this up?
[70:22.58]I need one.
[70:23.02]There's too many greens.
[70:24.45]There's too many green figures.
[70:26.65]Just make a square of... Oh.

[70:55.91]This is fun.
[70:56.79]I like this one.
[71:00.57]That's what I was trying to do right there.
[71:05.21]Get a double...
[71:27.28]I did it.
[71:27.56]I beat the level.
[71:28.02]I win.
[71:28.26]Alright, now that I know what's going on, watch this.
[72:03.40]Yeah!
[72:33.22]Oh, wait, look out!
[72:34.88]Oh, shit, it's, uh... It's the birdie from Five Nights at Freddy's!
[72:41.13]Ah!
[72:41.27]Whoa!
[73:12.09]Why is nobody clicking on the screen?
[73:17.62]That's your cue.
[73:32.71]VeggieTales?
[73:33.61]Where's the VeggieTales one?
[73:36.29]You want me to play a hundred thousand Mahjong games?
[73:42.00]okay that looks like the place we're going excellent but am I saying it wrong it's it's mahjong right mahjong mahjong it's correct isn't it am I doing it wrong
[74:18.04]Alright, let's open it.
[74:19.82]100,000 Mahjong games.
[74:27.37]Let's see what happens here.
[74:28.71]Let's get it open.
[74:32.75]Alright, look at this.
[74:34.29]Oh, wow.
[74:38.05]So, interesting to note about this one in particular.
[74:40.57]This is very important.
[74:42.47]This is the Windows 95 logo.
[74:53.27]Might even be Windows 3.1.
[74:54.03]They just don't give a shit, do they?
[75:01.86]I have no idea how to play this.
[75:04.22]I don't know what any of this means.
[75:05.80]I've never done it before.
[75:07.52]I think one time I watched my brother play it.
[75:11.03]And you have to match symbols or something, right?
[75:13.51]Match tiles.
[75:22.27]And they're layered.
[75:29.96]So I gotta find these two.
[75:44.33]I'm gonna wait for it.
[75:45.41]Until somebody figures out what I'm doing.
[75:50.05]Just gonna hang out here for a sec.
[76:07.31]Oh, yeah, I was right.
[76:08.01]You have to match them.
[76:08.61]Okay.
[76:09.55]So get out of here.
[76:10.19]Get off the screen.
[76:10.83]Get out of here.
[76:12.41]I don't need that.
[76:13.64]I'll figure it out.
[76:14.42]It's just... Here we go.
[76:35.74]What on Earth are you guys clicking right now?
[76:54.88]Alright, hold on.
[76:56.00]I can do it.
[77:53.61]That one's not here.
[77:54.51]I'm just being silent right now.
[77:56.37]I'm being so quiet.
[78:01.15]Where?
[78:01.33]Right here.
[78:02.09]No, it has to be on the edge.
[78:06.83]Got it.
[78:09.75]Sometimes you just figure out that you're really good at something.
[78:19.23]What?
[78:19.41]That's on the edge.
[78:27.54]It's a nice, interesting game.
[78:31.16]So where are the 100,000... Okay, are there 100,000 pieces?
[78:40.11]This isn't 3D.
[78:45.77]Wait, what?
[78:46.55]This is so much easier to see this.
[78:51.07]This is 3D.
[78:52.73]This is 2D, apparently.
[79:01.34]What did I just do?
[79:04.48]Let me like, let me use my finger.
[79:13.74]Hold on, I gotta use my finger.
[79:14.90]Like I, sometimes I need to use my hands because I got a touch screen here, so.
[79:20.99]Just want to make sure you guys can see what I'm doing.
[79:35.97]I used to be pretty good at this.
[79:46.48]1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[79:50.48]These two.
[79:51.20]Those two.
[79:54.35]These two.
[79:55.17]Right there.
[79:55.61]Those two.
[79:56.37]Those two.
[79:56.85]These two.
[79:57.21]6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[79:58.05]Okay.
[79:58.33]I'm kind of stuck here, though.
[80:03.83]Because...
[80:06.03]There's a couple of different ways to... Seven, eight, nine... Okay.
[80:14.40]No, I can do really quick math in my head, so... Green into green, and then the red into red, and then the black frame into the green, and then... Okay.
[80:46.85]Okay.
[80:47.33]That was kind of hard.
[80:48.89]It was like... Touching the screen is like hard to do.
[80:53.69]But I got it.
[80:56.99]That was fun.
[81:00.70]What a god of a gamer.
[81:01.64]I mean... Stop.
[81:04.52]Not say that.
[81:05.08]Not really.
[81:05.66]Kind of.
[81:06.14]I mean, you know.
[81:07.96]Sometimes.
[81:08.42]I mean, you know.
[81:08.88]Whatever.
[81:09.54]Thanks for the compliment.
[81:16.09]That was 100,000 Mahjong games.
[81:23.51]Computer, load up Celery Man.
[81:27.26]What?
[81:31.36]You lost 300 viewers playing Mahjong.
[81:39.14]Well, let's be honest here.
[81:41.37]If you clicked on a live stream...
[81:43.91]and a guy was playing Mahjong on it.
[81:47.01]And it was on the screen for more than 10 seconds.
[81:50.08]You'd probably be like, ah, I don't know if I want to watch a guy play Mahjong.
[81:55.58]And you'd probably just leave.
[81:56.28]Alright, where are we going now?
[81:59.88]What do you guys think?
[82:09.68]Oh, are we considering another 3D game that's guaranteed to either not work or crash OBS?
[82:15.98]I'm looking forward to it!
[82:31.42]Why does nobody like Atom Ball?
[82:38.45]Adam Ball.
[82:39.01]There's the Pac-Man clone.
[82:40.39]That one's from the last one, too.
[82:43.59]One vote is currently on.
[82:47.86]One vote is currently on.
[82:51.66]Alright, let's open it.
[82:52.36]This is... What the heck is this one?
[82:56.52]Which one are you clicking on?
[82:57.42]Mystery.
[82:58.22]World War II Aerial Dogfight.
[82:59.98]I remember this one was in the other one, too.
[83:01.84]It has really loud music and impossible to control.
[83:04.54]Welcome to the reference.
[83:06.51]Here comes a reference.
[83:12.24]Thank you for voting.
[83:19.88]Let's just redo the video.
[83:21.16]Alright, I'm going to make sure the screen is not going to be terrible here.
[83:27.12]Where the hell is OBS?
[83:33.42]Where did OBS go?
[83:36.08]That was kind of scary.
[83:38.32]Alright, I'm not going to change it yet just in case it's all fucked up.
[83:45.19]And we have video options.
[83:46.51]So.
[83:48.65]Resolution.
[83:51.53]Field of view.
[83:52.43]Big.
[83:55.46]This might.
[83:56.14]Okay.
[83:56.80]You take a look at this and you tell me if you think this is going to crash the whole fucking game and the whole stream.
[84:03.10]Not me.
[84:03.58]Not my face.
[84:04.80]This.
[84:08.02]I mean, resolution, scene detail, shadow reflection, cool effect if enabled, if special effects is enabled, 3D sound, hardware sound, this is just all these boxes are ways to crash my computer.
[84:26.47]Think of the amount of troubleshooting it would take to potentially have to deal with all these checkboxes.
[84:34.10]Good luck.
[84:43.38]I just clicked it.
[84:43.88]Uh-oh.
[84:52.75]It worked.
[84:55.15]Yeah, this is the same one.
[84:56.53]I remember this one.
[84:58.15]The loud-ass music.
[84:59.59]Alright, hold on.
[85:03.37]I can make it look better.
[85:12.11]That's as good as it's gonna get.
[85:15.62]Oh no!
[85:17.20]No!
[85:17.50]Wait, didn't this happen before?
[85:19.98]This happened last time!
[85:21.10]It cras- I- This happened in the video, it crashed the computer.
[85:24.84]I remember and I finally got it to work.
[85:26.34]It's over!
[85:27.42]It's done.
[85:27.78]This happened in the last fucking- in the video.
[85:31.04]No!
[85:36.59]Oh my god, I can't fucking believe it.
[85:38.57]I just relived it.
[85:41.87]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[85:44.15]God damn it.
[85:50.12]Go pull up that video, watch this part.
[85:52.88]This exact same thing happened.
[85:54.06]I had to restart the computer, I think.
[85:56.12]Fuck!
[85:57.14]Hold on.
[86:00.13]Oh, shit.
[86:11.03]I think I can get it.
[86:11.83]Can I just kill it from here?
[86:14.89]It might kill OBS.
[86:16.63]No!
[86:17.05]Oh no!
[86:18.88]No!
[86:20.30]Don't kill OBS.
[86:25.26]Good luck.
[86:26.60]I'll see you guys soon.
[86:28.18]Hopefully.
[86:28.78]If it doesn't... Hello?
[86:50.19]Where's the webcam?
[86:54.77]Am I still here?
[87:00.22]What?
[87:12.79]I didn't do that.
[87:14.41]I didn't do that.
[87:21.84]What happened to the camera?
[87:31.65]Can you see this?
[87:36.87]Okay.
[87:39.17]So this time, we're going to... Hold on.
[87:46.35]Oh, that was wild!
[87:51.00]I can't, just here we go.
[87:51.98]Ready?
[88:00.65]Hands up.
[88:01.85]I clicked it.
[88:02.51]I'm not touching anything.
[88:04.23]Oh, you can feel it.
[88:05.17]Feel it.
[88:05.55]Do you see that?
[88:06.23]Do you feel it?
[88:12.23]I'm like fucking melting.
[88:20.52]I can't do anything about this, just fucking campaign, who cares.
[88:28.54]Yep, this is the- I remember, you can't control the plane.
[88:35.89]What happened?
[88:37.45]Oh, I hit the end.
[88:52.20]Alright, let's go.
[88:54.80]Leave your left hand on the keyboard, okay?
[88:57.59]Is it gonna sense it?
[89:03.87]You could hit the broadside of a barn!
[89:09.89]By the way, why am I doing this?
[89:15.17]Look at that creepy fucking emo face that guy's making.
[89:22.67]Got it.
[89:26.82]No, no!
[89:27.68]Exit, exit the game!
[89:29.14]Oh shit, quickly, hold on.
[89:38.83]No, this might be it.
[90:02.81]Oh fuck, it's over.
[90:04.27]I can't- I'm the task manager on the other- on the monitor.
[90:09.27]Oh shit, I did it accidentally.
[90:14.88]Oh my fucking god.
[90:35.42]Well, that was a 3D game that I should never open ever again.
[90:58.86]What are you clicking on now?
[91:04.03]I'm so upset that this is just the same fucking game.
[91:09.52]There's almost no differences.
[91:14.76]It's probably all DigiPen student games through a shell company.
[91:20.11]Honest to God, though, why is this a second version?
[91:26.21]Okay, at some point here, I want to open up the screenshot that I took of the last one.
[91:32.32]and actually see if they just put two in front of the game and released it again.
[91:45.17]Looks like we're going to Atom Ball.
[91:48.71]Atom Ball.
[91:51.93]What a joke.
[91:56.85]What an absolute joke.
[92:00.75]700,000 games?
[92:01.91]Two!
[92:04.72]Nothing is the same.
[92:06.10]Games have the same problems.
[92:07.34]We just put a two in front.
[92:08.48]That's it.
[92:10.98]I'd like to know what the two... What it actually is.
[92:16.22]So, where are we going?
[92:16.96]Atom Ball?
[92:20.08]Alright.
[92:20.84]Hold on to your hats.
[92:24.02]Because here comes Atom Ball.
[92:28.76]Where the hell is it?
[92:29.42]I actually don't even know where it is.
[92:31.46]Adam Ball.
[92:32.36]Oh, okay.
[92:32.80]It's down this one, this one.
[92:37.20]Alright.
[92:40.62]Here we go.
[92:42.22]Good luck.
[92:42.52]I'm going to have to do a full clean install of Windows after this.
[92:47.02]Let me just make sure it works.
[92:57.45]Same problems as last time.
[92:59.77]I'm just reliving the making of that last video.
[93:04.95]Because that one didn't open.
[93:07.77]What is the 2 for?
[93:10.39]What is the 2 for?
[93:17.48]You misread.
[93:18.10]It's 700,000 games 2, meaning also.
[93:21.54]Means it's just, again.
[93:24.73]Oh my god, this one doesn't open either.
[93:26.49]Adam, what's it called?
[93:27.99]Adam Ball.
[93:30.30]Put an X on it.
[93:32.72]We also need to see if the same games didn't open.
[93:35.46]Because I thought some of them did.
[93:37.08]Holy shit, I can't even fucking believe this.
[93:46.44]Well, let's see what else there is to try and attempt.
[93:55.91]What's the original 700,000 Games like?
[93:59.52]It's this.
[94:00.54]It's this.
[94:00.88]It's the same thing.
[94:06.26]I think we may have actually been baited on me making the video again.
[94:15.91]That's what happened.
[94:21.57]So it looks like we're doing the ancient Mayan Empire.
[94:28.39]All those are the same exact game, alright?
[94:32.14]Just in case anyone's wondering, there's no difference in those games.
[94:40.32]There's no differences!
[94:42.26]They are all the same game.
[94:44.81]So I can just delete all of these.
[94:46.93]Oh my God, this is going to take 20,000 hours.
[94:50.55]Secret Empires of Maya, open it.
[95:01.48]Holy shit, this actually takes up the whole screen.
[95:05.02]What a miracle.
[95:08.54]That's an actual miracle.
[95:13.98]Is this the first one that's actually 1920x1080?
[95:16.91]Why is this all off?
[95:25.15]Okay.
[95:27.83]Hey, remember that video?
[95:29.77]Ow, my ears.
[95:46.68]Let's try this one.
[95:55.05]Now I know why they had it all turned down.
[95:58.87]Secret empire of the ancient world.
[96:01.65]Inca.
[96:05.51]Good.
[96:05.97]Alright.
[96:06.23]What are we looking for?
[96:06.87]We're looking for chain, crowbar, sunglasses, domino tires, seagull.
[96:13.11]Russian doll, maps, sapphire.
[96:16.67]Sapphire's got it.
[96:26.16]My god.
[96:27.96]Why?
[96:33.41]It's just reset.
[96:34.23]It's the same.
[96:34.77]There's no difference.
[96:35.53]It's the same background.
[96:36.71]It's just a desktop background with a bunch of random blurry bitmap images.
[96:41.05]This is the same thing as it was before.
[96:42.66]There's not one single difference.
[96:46.08]Scrub brush.
[96:48.14]Oil can.
[96:49.44]Night.
[96:50.82]Let us click the screen.
[96:52.04]Sure thing.
[96:53.28]Go for it.
[96:54.44]We're looking for brooch, wheel, belt, oil can, skull, scrub brush, owl, lunch box.
[97:05.86]That's not, that's not correct.
[97:08.75]Good work, you found one.
[97:15.38]Lunchbox.
[97:18.80]What is this?
[97:19.30]A piece of bread?
[97:29.97]Alright, got that one.
[97:30.77]I only need the owl and that's it.
[97:32.23]Where's the owl?
[97:32.85]Find it.
[97:33.37]Found it.
[97:34.87]I did it.
[97:35.45]Done.
[97:38.89]Oh, no I didn't.
[97:39.69]Brooch, wheel, and belt.
[97:41.51]Wheel...
[97:45.11]Let's sunglasses.
[97:46.11]Why are you clicking on the sunglasses?
[97:46.98]There's the brooch.
[97:48.62]And then we need a belt.
[97:49.28]There's the belt.
[97:51.50]Congratulations, you have won the game.
[97:53.34]Thank you for playing.
[97:54.13]What the fuck am I...
[98:13.53]Why is there a piece of bread on the goat's ass?
[98:15.89]Alright, help me out here.
[98:20.74]Let's speedrun this.
[98:27.64]Everybody clicked right here.
[98:28.66]There's no goat.
[98:32.04]The goat's not here.
[98:33.08]Thank you!
[98:34.04]No, it's the cat again.
[98:35.16]The same, like, ten people clicked on the cat.
[98:40.26]Okay, that looks good.
[98:48.09]Are you guys even trying?
[98:50.21]Somebody is.
[98:50.71]Come on, we need to get to the third level.
[99:08.93]We need to find the brush.
[99:10.31]Where's the... Where's the toothbrush?
[99:12.37]Whatever kind of brush that is.
[99:14.44]Found it.
[99:17.00]Congratulations, you've done it.
[99:25.85]Alright, here's a... I gotta... Listen.
[99:30.81]If you guys can get all nine of these in nine separate circles...
[99:39.00]you win.
[99:42.12]Can you do it?
[99:47.72]You guys will win.
[99:48.68]Collectively Chat will win the prize.
[99:51.86]And the prize is you get to see my face on FaceCam and I'll wink.
[99:55.93]What a great prize that is.
[99:59.75]Good luck.
[100:07.86]Okay, we got mouse.
[100:11.50]One, two, three.
[100:14.96]I'm not, scroll, is that correct?
[100:17.28]Scrolls, you did kind of good job so far.
[100:22.98]Comb, I think you guys, did you guys do it?
[100:29.15]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[100:31.91]Uh-oh.
[100:36.88]Uh-oh.
[100:38.64]There's no crow on this list.
[100:51.28]You guys were so close.
[100:57.05]What's that?
[100:57.39]That's not even anything either.
[100:58.25]You guys got that wrong too.
[101:00.47]Two!
[101:01.47]Holy shit, you guys got a lot wrong.
[101:13.42]Oh, no, that is right.
[101:14.12]That's correct.
[101:18.70]Oh, that's correct, too.
[101:20.66]Yeah, you guys didn't get it.
[101:22.50]Sorry.
[101:25.45]Sorry, guys.
[101:28.81]You want to try it one more time?
[101:33.27]Think you have what it takes?
[101:36.53]I'll give you a minute to look.
[101:47.39]I want 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 circles.
[101:51.73]And they all need to be on the right thing.
[101:54.70]And I'm going to wink at you.
[101:58.24]Look how cool that reaction gif would be.
[101:59.94]You know, like you're talking to somebody on Twitter and it's like, Oh yeah, that's definitely my favorite game.
[102:04.54]I just did it.
[102:45.60]Get a minute here.
[102:51.42]Imagine the audacity that you would have to put these four in a row on each other.
[102:59.33]To release it twice.
[103:03.83]Secret empires.
[103:05.07]Secret empires.
[103:06.39]Aztec, Inca, Maya.
[103:09.97]And you click the send to Amazon purchasing button.
[103:21.09]Balls!
[103:22.39]It's actually almost, like... That's, like, almost commendable at that point.
[103:32.20]Okay, here we go.
[103:33.62]I want nine circles.
[103:35.52]And if you had, guys, nine circles, I'll give you a sneeze.
[103:38.65]You can get it.
[103:57.34]It's coming.
[103:59.39]Did you get it?
[104:07.33]It's trying.
[104:08.81]Oh, it wanted to come up so bad.
[104:13.45]Did you get it?
[104:14.59]Let's see.
[104:27.17]Alright, we got one.
[104:29.49]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[104:31.89]Who fucking did this?
[104:36.67]It's a wasp.
[104:38.04]That's why.
[104:40.90]Let's see if you got it.
[104:44.48]Two.
[104:52.43]You didn't get it.
[105:11.49]You didn't say they had to be correct.
[105:13.37]What did you think I meant?
[105:15.39]Just put nine circles?
[105:22.31]Oh, we have to beat this one.
[105:27.71]I did this last time, Goldfish.
[105:29.17]I'm gonna give you guys one last chance to get a sneeze.
[105:46.47]I actually don't know where they are.
[105:48.45]I actually don't know where the fuck they are.
[105:56.35]Alright, let's see what happens first.
[105:58.09]Can you guys find the remaining four?
[106:02.20]No, no, no, no, not yet, not yet.
[106:03.74]We're gonna do this for next time.
[106:04.86]We're gonna have a contest.
[106:10.26]You and me.
[106:11.46]Where's the moon?
[106:12.50]And where's the pipe?
[106:13.76]Find it.
[106:18.53]Where's the moon?
[106:18.95]Where's the pipe?
[106:19.65]Find it.
[106:21.91]Good work.
[106:22.67]Where's the moon?
[106:23.75]Find it.
[106:32.94]Where's the moon?
[106:36.16]That's a cat.
[106:37.02]I could have just looked at that.
[106:38.66]Where's the moon?
[106:43.13]Holy shit, that was hidden.
[106:44.21]Alright, you guys ready?
[106:46.57]The next, the goal here for you guys is can you find all of these 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 before I get to negative 100,000 points.
[106:56.07]Ready?
[106:56.39]Go.
[107:35.92]My hand, my hand is fucking killing me.
[107:39.54]What did I get to?
[107:40.26]Alright, when I get to negative 10,000.
[108:06.94]points for that.
[108:08.64]I clicked it.
[108:09.70]Alright!
[108:10.42]Did you do it?
[108:12.73]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[108:15.99]You didn't do it.
[108:18.33]Bird.
[108:19.59]Mouse.
[108:21.43]What have you guys done?
[108:23.43]It's not even correct.
[108:27.05]Candles.
[108:29.47]Circle.
[108:29.89]I don't know what that was, but I already clicked it.
[108:34.22]Uh, hook.
[108:35.86]Water jug.
[108:36.60]You missed, uh... I don't know what these are.
[108:39.98]Heart?
[108:40.72]And I don't know what that is.
[108:42.48]You missed them.
[108:43.40]Sorry.
[108:45.12]I win.
[108:53.39]Yeah.
[108:56.89]That's not it.
[108:59.21]That's not correct.
[109:02.20]Alright, if I can find it before you guys, I win.
[109:05.28]Ready?
[109:07.45]Go.
[109:12.35]Got it.
[109:12.67]I fucking lose.
[109:13.89]Alright, that was fun.
[109:16.51]We're out.
[109:24.60]Alright, this is seriously just dump whatever's in grandma's closet after she's owned the house for a hundred years into the living room and figure out what you're gonna sell and what you're gonna- who's gonna take what.
[109:40.90]Well, you know, like the four kids.
[109:42.99]Who the fuck is taking the penguin statue?
[109:45.69]What are we gonna do with that?
[110:12.29]That's enough of that.
[110:18.39]I'm not going to click the other one.
[110:19.35]You already know what it is.
[110:24.32]It's literally the exact same game.
[110:25.76]They just put a two on it.
[110:29.84]This game has one review on Amazon.
[110:32.74]It is a one star review.
[110:34.58]The person just wrote, I can't get it to work.
[110:36.56]That's the only review on the entire website.
[110:40.76]So, got baited pretty hard here.
[110:43.52]But, you know, you got to commit.
[110:49.51]Alright.
[110:50.33]Where are we going now?
[110:59.93]No.
[111:01.75]Really?
[111:04.14]Why do you guys want to do that of all the things to do?
[111:12.98]Oh my god, whatever.
[111:15.08]Somebody just gave a lot of money.
[111:18.81]Hold on.
[111:21.43]While we sit here for a moment, thank you to just that guy for the $70.
[111:27.67]$60 right now, and then $10 a few minutes ago.
[111:37.50]Holy shit, man.
[111:38.18]Thank you for the $70 fucking dollars.
[111:46.60]Thank you.
[111:47.00]You say, Jeremy, you legendary shit poster.
[111:49.93]Of course you would do this again.
[111:51.85]But I would recommend if you really want the chat to make bad decisions, you should send them to cool math games.
[111:59.01]We tried that before and it was a disaster.
[112:02.44]And then you say, try the worst game here and make the chat pay for you to change it.
[112:09.56]That's so terrible.
[112:10.96]Why would I want to do that?
[112:12.78]Make you pay?
[112:18.29]Um, if I just, okay, first of all, thank you for the $70, but let's go over this for a second here.
[112:24.46]If I sat here like this, right?
[112:30.02]If I'm sitting here like this and I say, okay guys, sorry, but, um, for us to play, uh, another game, you're gonna have to give me 50 bucks.
[112:41.69]You just leave.
[112:44.17]You'd be like, okay, X.
[112:47.48]I got some laundry I could probably fucking do.
[112:50.22]I would just sit here and watch the view count drop by, like, four or five thousand.
[112:54.48]Some of you guys would stay.
[112:56.00]Just to see, like, what would happen.
[112:58.58]But you would just leave.
[113:03.65]I don't know if I... I don't know if that's a good idea.
[113:06.59]What the... Oh.
[113:08.81]Alright, so we're going... Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[113:14.01]Uh-huh.
[113:17.11]I can't fucking believe I'm pressing this button.
[113:20.61]But I am.
[113:28.24]I just have to press it, right?
[113:31.80]Oh my god.
[113:34.60]The Bala Koala, thanks for the $50.
[113:40.00]Alright, here you go.
[113:43.57]So that means I have to get off of this.
[113:47.13]He used to get $50 to get off of this one.
[113:50.49]It actually worked.
[113:52.39]No, no, you can't pay.
[113:54.75]You can't pay.
[113:55.77]What's going on with the camera?
[113:57.11]You can't pay money to influence what I do on this stream.
[114:01.77]You understand?
[114:02.69]If you want to give money, thanks, but I can't put that as a precedent.
[114:08.07]Because we've got Super Frog 2 to play.
[114:12.79]Everybody X out of the window.
[114:15.37]No, stay, stay.
[114:22.17]Here, click on your favorite fucking toy.
[114:27.30]Click your favorite toy on here and I'll be able to judge you guys.
[114:34.36]Fox, cool.
[114:36.32]That's a pretty cool toy.
[114:37.90]Forget about what...
[114:40.99]The Ankh.
[114:42.97]That's the Ankh, right?
[114:45.13]Okay, cool.
[114:47.05]A bottle of wine.
[114:47.84]That's pretty nice.
[114:49.36]Gecko, nice little pet.
[114:52.20]A bird.
[114:52.84]Crow.
[114:54.76]There's a monkey of some sort.
[114:57.26]Skull.
[115:00.16]And I'm surprised no one has clicked on the cockroach or the spider.
[115:05.42]Or the snail.
[115:05.98]I would have clicked on the snail.
[115:11.76]Or the turtle.
[115:14.44]Or the sun.
[115:15.76]Nice work, guys.
[115:17.16]That's it.
[115:17.80]That's the end of that one.
[115:21.19]So now, let's actually get the next one going here.
[115:23.73]Because that one was banned, but I got paid $50 to do it.
[115:28.97]What's next?
[115:39.83]Do I have time to eat like a bowl of spaghetti?
[115:45.41]I'm gonna eat a bowl of spaghetti really fast.
[115:48.30]Okay.

[130:14.66]A really small mummy.
[130:17.18]A mummy that is not even like three feet tall.
[130:26.25]It's not that scary.
[130:30.24]What a real compact mummy.
[130:34.93]Yep, it sure is.

[132:14.42]It might be.
[132:15.08]It might be illegal, but I want this.
[132:26.13]It's probably... Honestly, this whole game is probably ripped off from Google Images anyways.
[132:31.95]I wonder if I can find this image.
[132:36.79]Some of you guys that use the internet.
[132:38.99]That know exactly what the fuck you're doing.

[138:20.05]Which has been found?
[138:28.21]Is my computer lagging?
[138:29.51]I don't even know how to play that game.
[138:34.00]No, wait, wait, wait.
[138:34.58]You found the image?
[138:35.98]No fucking way.
[138:55.44]Unbelievable.
[139:00.10]I can't fucking believe you found it.
[139:03.67]Hold on.
[139:12.11]How did you find this that quickly?
[139:26.95]Unbelievable.
[139:33.99]But where did that come from?
[139:42.25]And did they have permission to put it in their game?
[139:50.20]No way.
[139:57.17]Guaranteed no.
[139:58.45]Guaranteed no.
[140:05.11]Is it the right witch?
[140:08.20]Hold on.
[140:10.90]Nobody plays backgammon.
[140:14.40]No one.
[140:16.26]Who cares about backgammon?
[140:19.50]It doesn't make any sense.
[140:22.46]Bye.
[140:23.26]See you later.
[140:31.74]Alright.
[140:35.16]And this is very important, actually.
[140:40.08]Let's see.
[140:41.54]Okay, for a second, I was freaking out.
[140:43.00]Yeah, I saved it to the desktop.
[140:44.85]So there it is.
[140:52.39]This file is 27 kilobytes.
[140:57.10]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[140:57.88]This is important.
[141:00.02]I need to open up.
[141:02.22]Just wait.
[141:03.50]We need to see if it's the right witch.
[141:05.16]That's actually pretty important.
[141:07.45]It is the right witch.
[141:08.09]I don't even know why we're doing this.
[141:09.05]You know how much time?
[141:10.69]There's so much that we still have to go through.
[141:13.09]And I'm doing this shit right now?
[141:30.43]She's not here.
[141:31.81]I have to beat this level.
[141:33.85]Edit the snort over her face.
[141:39.87]Hold on.
[141:59.67]Why is that so funny?
[142:04.11]I gotta get rid of the white.
[142:05.01]Hold on.
[142:27.56]Alright, where's the witch?
[142:28.94]So we can compare the image.
[142:36.94]I don't see the witch anywhere.
[142:39.78]No.
[142:40.32]I just need to, like, just skip everything.
[142:48.67]It's the castle game?
[142:49.71]Wrong game.
[142:50.31]Middle left of screen.
[142:53.24]I don't see the witch anywhere.
[142:54.76]What are you talking about?
[142:56.52]It's there in all... It's not... Guys, everyone that's saying that I'm an idiot, you have to remember these are all the same fucking video game.
[143:05.72]The assets are the same across the entire five game catalog.
[143:10.21]Just...
[143:23.24]Scorpion, we're just going to get to the next level.
[143:25.10]Scorpion, find the bread.
[143:28.42]One more.
[143:28.82]Crossbones and scorpion.
[143:30.06]Scorpion, crossbones.
[143:31.76]Got it.
[143:32.08]Okay, here we go.
[144:03.35]It's not the same image.
[144:06.99]This is not the same image.
[144:10.37]That's impossible.
[144:16.36]I don't believe it.
[144:20.20]Hold on.
[144:36.94]No fucking way.
[144:37.76]It's a different witch.
[144:48.62]Hold on, is there another one?
[144:51.23]No fucking way.
[144:52.79]I refuse to believe there's another one.
[144:55.77]There's no way.
[145:06.44]Oh my god, there's another one.
[145:10.60]Oh my god, but it's not the right one.
[145:14.12]That's not correct.
[145:18.29]Guys, that's not correct!
[145:21.35]That's not the right one!
[145:24.87]Look!
[145:31.29]It's not correct!
[145:34.42]You gotta be fucking kidding me!
[145:37.58]Hold on a second.
[145:51.47]Are you guys ready for this shit?
[146:05.51]It's a different witch!
[146:10.33]We need to transform it.
[146:11.47]It's not the same!
[146:22.89]We need to get it out of there exactly.
[146:26.34]I need to transform it.
[146:28.94]Oh.
[146:40.23]Get this out of the way.
[146:42.59]Is it the same image?
[146:45.05]How do I rotate this?
[146:52.80]How can these be different images, though?
[146:55.54]That's the thing I don't fucking understand.
[147:00.73]It has edits on it, so they didn't get fucking sued.
[147:05.77]Is this the same person?
[147:09.21]I can't... I don't know if this is even the same.
[147:11.51]The broom is a different direction.
[147:16.51]It's been photoshopped.
[147:29.27]And it's blurry.
[147:31.07]Hold on.
[147:31.91]I need to fucking fix this.
[147:48.48]No, I can't I can't do it The hat is different
[148:21.30]It's so fucking pixelated, it's almost impossible to tell.
[148:24.04]Dude, look at- but look at the hat though!
[148:36.55]I think they just like smeared it in Photoshop.
[148:45.04]It's a mix of the two images!
[148:49.51]Did her mouth just move?
[148:52.57]The one on the right's mouth just moved.
[148:54.15]Oh, what the fuck?
[149:01.69]I just... I'm scared myself.
[149:05.61]Okay, I need to get out of this.
[149:11.41]Turn these off.
[149:13.69]That's actually un-fucking-believable, though.
[149:19.61]My god.
[149:29.97]Wait a minute.

[149:30.79]Wait, wait, wait.

[152:14.34]I don't know what that was.
[152:16.38]What was that?
[152:17.76]What's the last thing we did?
[152:20.31]It was backgammon 3D, okay.
[152:24.47]So are you guys gonna behave?
[152:25.61]Can I turn it back on?

[153:03.36]Hold on.
[153:05.60]You guys are still finding these images.
[153:07.34]It's actually pretty... This one is pretty shocking.
[153:12.17]That's kind of ridiculous.
[153:13.07]I mean, there's so many of these.
[153:15.33]Wow.
[153:18.57]Where did you find that one?
[153:20.11]There's so many.
[153:29.35]Is there some website?
[153:30.25]Is there gonna be some website that you're going to to be able to create these, to see these?
[153:36.29]Witch on broom with scary face.
[153:38.79]That's the number one result.
[153:42.02]Whoa.
[153:44.04]Isn't that interesting?
[153:50.70]Alright, what are we playing?
[153:58.42]Amphric, thanks for the five community subs.
[154:02.15]You tried to make another deck and you failed.
[154:04.13]I don't even know where you guys are going with this.
[154:05.61]So I'm going to pick one that's in the middle.
[154:07.27]I see Airball and Mystic Demon.
[154:10.37]Between the two nuts is the shaft of the penis.
[154:15.53]And I'm going to pick one that's in there because you reap what you sow.
[154:19.50]So we're going to go with... We're going to go with Airball.
[154:27.71]Airball, here we go.
[154:31.47]Thanks for voting.
[154:39.20]Let's see if this one works.
[154:43.50]It does.
[154:45.10]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
[154:48.38]Maybe it doesn't.
[154:51.00]No, it does.
[154:59.31]Ay-yi-yi.
[154:59.89]Wow, that's a nice little bit.
[155:23.34]Wait, what?
[155:24.60]What is, why is this on the screen?
[155:26.61]Oh, it's because, oh, I can't even turn it off.
[155:29.37]Hold on.
[155:29.87]I can't even get out of this.
[155:31.05]Why is, fuck.
[155:31.83]Alright, get off.
[155:33.47]It's because this capture is all fucked up.
[155:49.60]Oh my goodness.
[155:50.92]Reset it.
[155:51.92]Here we go.
[155:53.68]Okay.
[155:54.52]Okay.
[155:55.75]I'm ready.
[155:58.41]Why did the music just drastically fucking change?
[156:02.79]Oh, the music is so bad and loud.
[156:08.98]What happened?
[156:09.66]Ugh.
[156:20.95]I'm not even gonna attempt to fix the... I'm not gonna even attempt to fix the fucking screen here.
[156:26.57]I can't even leave the window.
[156:27.57]Look at... What does it have to do?
[156:32.10]Okay, load game, new game, save game, new game.
[156:34.84]Choose your pad.
[156:35.74]Blue.
[156:38.36]One.
[156:39.82]One.
[156:41.08]That's my desktop background.
[156:43.30]And it's just a mirror.
[156:45.08]How lazy do you have to be?
[156:47.56]That's the ultimate in laziness.
[156:50.40]You just mirrored one image to make a giant screen.
[156:55.37]Why wouldn't you just get a picture that was big enough to fit?
[156:58.63]Why?
[157:02.93]What?
[157:03.35]Am I a penguin?
[157:05.13]No, I'm not the penguin.
[157:09.05]Oh, it's just Brick Breaker.
[157:16.88]This one's fun.
[157:20.54]This one's really fun, actually.
[157:21.72]Oops.
[157:22.46]Sorry.
[157:26.54]It's kind of hard to control, though.
[157:46.72]Ah, I thought I could make it.
[157:49.12]Oh, that's... Somebody here thought that was funny.
[158:15.96]Kill the penguin.
[158:16.74]I mean, I'm about to.
[158:17.84]The penguin's about to be dead.
[158:23.85]Gotta maximize these shots.
[158:26.63]Beautiful.
[158:31.83]What?
[158:31.95]It's not a real penguin, guys.
[158:33.37]It's a digital... It's a digital copy.
[158:39.14]Well, that's a perfect copy.
[158:41.42]It's not a real penguin.
[158:56.10]I just... In bowling, this is the worst thing you can possibly do.
[158:59.08]Seven, ten, bucking, grid, split.
[159:10.89]Excellent.
[159:11.93]Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[159:13.87]I'm the best.
[159:25.34]That one's fucking dumb.
[159:32.47]It was fun, though.
[159:33.11]It was okay.
[159:35.33]So that brings us to... Where the heck was that?
[159:38.89]Airball.
[159:43.11]It was just holding you back, yeah.
[159:45.14]I agree.
[159:57.67]I'm gonna get spaghetti.
[160:00.83]Alright, we're almost at the three hour mark.
[160:02.97]And we're... You know, we're almost like 30% or 40% of the way there.
[160:11.34]So I'm gonna eat spaghetti.
[160:13.70]I'll be back in probably 45.
[160:15.84]I'm just kidding.
[160:18.20]Motorbike racing is the one.
[160:21.18]Motorbike racing.
[160:24.76]Is it the one?
[160:28.39]Yeah, it looks like it.
[160:29.65]Extreme motorbike racing.
[160:37.34]I think this one was also in the... All of them were.
[160:40.48]I'm just... I'm watching one of my favorite movies that I haven't seen in a long time.
[160:46.70]That's what's happening right now.
[160:50.01]Extreme motorbike racing.
[160:51.45]Prepare for the crash.
[160:52.95]That's inevitable.
[160:56.97]Let's see what happens.
[161:08.22]I can't tell you.
[161:08.90]I don't know how loud this is.
[161:09.74]We're good.
[161:21.13]Can you see it?
[161:26.59]By the way, I just came to this realization.
[161:28.53]Turn the music off.
[161:35.02]You just... Contendo...
[161:40.73]Nintendo contendo okay can you guys I don't even know you guys can see I have no idea every other monitor is black this is apparently 1920 by 1080.
[162:11.22]I don't think I agree.
[162:16.48]Okay, here we go.
[162:18.28]Start game.
[162:19.40]Yes, I remember this one.
[162:20.40]Race 2, race 3.
[162:22.50]Fruising.
[162:23.78]No entrance fee, race 3.
[162:26.72]Yeah, I remember this one.
[162:27.96]This one sucks.
[162:30.44]Automatic transition.
[162:31.56]Let's go.
[162:40.26]Holy shit, it is... It is 1920x1080.
[162:42.91]Yeah, this is the one where I just drove into the wall.
[162:47.69]What?
[162:47.85]That's my favorite movie.
[162:51.55]I forget how you do that, though.
[162:55.85]How do you do that?
[163:03.58]How do you make that happen?
[163:06.54]This is just a taxi driver coming right here.
[163:08.60]Yeah, it probably is.
[163:13.55]How did I get on one wheel?
[163:19.49]Oh my god.
[163:20.79]Oh no.
[163:26.99]Space Nitro is controlled.
[163:32.88]Handbrake is space Nitro.
[163:34.30]Control.
[163:35.14]Horn.
[163:35.66]H. Toggle.
[163:36.30]Lights.
[163:41.42]desktop alright so we're gonna have to do we need CLH and control there it is remember this remember this part of the video I do
[164:11.83]Let me actually, like... What?
[164:15.22]Oh.
[164:16.60]I'm dropping in-game currency.
[164:19.14]I lost.
[164:25.52]Cruising.
[164:29.88]He did the thing, remember from the video?
[164:34.58]So this is just cruising around.
[164:41.86]I think I tried to go like 5,000 miles per hour last time.
[164:49.63]Well, it's still going.
[164:50.51]Let's try it again.
[164:56.03]You have nitro.
[164:56.75]You didn't fit in nitro.
[164:57.58]You need to get a straightaway.
[164:58.50]This is not really a good straightaway.
[165:03.56]This is the mountains.
[165:04.40]Handbrake.
[165:05.90]Come on.
[165:08.54]Then I can do the joke.
[165:09.80]Yeah?
[165:09.98]Yeah.
[165:17.14]I would call this one the most complete video game, though.
[165:19.60]Don't you think?
[165:23.98]What?
[165:24.90]That didn't happen.
[165:25.74]That patched version 2!
[165:26.88]The one thing that they fixed in the game.
[165:31.76]The loudest water sound I've ever heard.
[165:51.07]It's turning.
[165:51.55]I'm gonna hit it again.
[165:53.23]I need to hit 500 miles per hour.
[165:56.23]Oh my fucking god, this is actually starting to aggravate me.
[166:08.47]Don't wheelie on slopes.
[166:11.16]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[166:16.56]Straight away?
[166:17.56]From this far away?
[166:18.28]No, not yet.
[166:20.04]Don't punch it yet.
[166:25.70]I gotta get a complete straight away.
[166:27.70]Which is... No, not yet.
[166:31.65]He's being backseated on 700,000 games.
[166:33.75]Punch it!
[166:34.19]Okay, stop.
[166:34.83]Slow down.
[166:46.00]This hurts my fucking head.
[166:58.27]How is second gear 200 miles per hour?
[167:05.51]This is a straightaway.
[167:06.27]I just wish it wouldn't be this long.
[167:21.87]It's so hard to control when you're going that fast.
[167:24.43]Last attempt.
[167:25.19]Are there more than two gears?
[167:33.89]I don't know.
[167:34.51]There might be.
[167:36.97]Straight away.
[167:42.70]Really?
[167:44.62]I don't fucking believe that for a second.
[167:47.54]How could you not have the gas station blow up?
[168:03.27]It's still going?
[168:04.85]Nah, it's just going down the street.
[168:06.47]Can I open the map?
[168:09.25]I mean, I know I shouldn't care this much about this, but I do.
[168:13.97]I need to do the joke.
[168:18.30]Otherwise, this is a different movie.
[168:32.28]Go in reverse?
[168:33.04]Probably, yeah, I can go in reverse.
[168:34.72]Here we go, straight away.
[168:35.72]This is it.
[168:36.34]You ready for the joke?
[168:51.59]That wasn't as good as the first movie.
[168:59.32]First movie was better.
[169:02.03]There's a jump here, though.
[169:05.77]Why would you put a jump there and not let me go over it?
[169:12.39]It's the same shot.
[169:13.65]I know, right?
[169:23.20]What happened?
[169:23.98]What?
[169:31.84]Last drive into a wall.
[169:33.08]LOL moment.
[169:35.12]Here it comes.
[169:37.16]Whatever.

[169:54.05]Wait, this is a new movie.
[169:55.93]This movie's new.
[169:56.79]I haven't seen this movie before.
[170:04.90]We've got a diff- a sequel!
[170:28.98]What the fuck is overhead right now?
[170:44.53]Just a casual zeppelin flying overhead.
[170:47.41]There you go.
[170:47.97]That was it.
[170:49.11]Thanks for playing.
[170:56.19]I don't even know what that was.
[171:01.30]Where the fuck is it?
[171:03.44]I don't know where it is.
[171:08.62]Where is it?
[171:12.26]Extreme motor... There it is.
[171:13.70]Okay.
[171:17.96]Alright, while you guys vote for the next one, I'm going to go grab some spaghetti.
[171:22.52]I'll be right back.
[171:23.26]I'm not doing that one again.
[171:24.15]Restart.
[171:24.83]Sorry.
[171:27.25]Alright, I'm going to be back in like two minutes.
[171:29.49]I'm not even going to do BRB.
[176:50.29]Hey, that's a pretty nice caterpillar.
[176:53.54]Or, um, car.
[176:58.46]So it looks like I get to... Hey, it's streamer's choice.
[177:04.67]You know what that means.
[177:07.23]I get to go anywhere in there.
[177:08.39]And I think we're going to do parking lot... Parking lot maze.
[177:14.33]Thanks for voting.
[177:20.77]Parking lot maze.
[177:22.01]Welcome back.
[177:24.27]I'm like, I just ran up the stairs.
[177:26.55]I ate spaghetti with my hands.
[177:28.82]And then came up and ran up the stairs.
[177:32.52]Alright, what do we got here?
[177:33.84]Uh...
[177:47.28]Ooh, this one actually I can drag the bottom.
[177:51.24]It's the first one I've been able to do that with.
[178:19.63]Uh, this music sucks.
[178:23.09]Turn it down.
[178:25.51]I don't know what the point was to do that.
[178:40.57]I'm sorry.
[178:41.23]Alright, start here.
[178:44.59]Monopoly!
[178:45.41]It's Fortnite Monopoly!
[178:48.69]Welcome to Parking Lot Maze.
[178:50.15]Parking Lot Maze is a... Come on.
[178:54.31]That's not even... Did you even try?
[178:56.90]I would see that and change that and fix that.
[179:01.74]Highly addictive puzzle game where your goal is to untangle the vehicles and restore traffic within the streets of Stresstropolis.
[179:11.17]Stresstropolis.
[179:14.09]Move the vehicles by clicking on them and clicking on an empty tile.
[179:16.87]I don't know what that says.
[179:20.05]However, you cannot move... I have to play this.
[179:22.05]It's just this thing.
[179:26.24]What?
[179:28.20]Yeah, I... I did it.
[179:34.06]The stress meter.
[179:35.30]Don't let stress meter fill up or you will lose a life.
[179:43.49]That's...
[179:46.29]Okay.
[179:48.39]Don't get stressed out and lose your life in traffic.
[179:53.24]Oh my god, that's fucking horrible.
[179:54.76]Okay, uh... I got out.
[179:57.40]Got out of traffic.
[180:04.44]Solve.
[180:04.72]If you can't get it, you can just solve it.
[180:06.66]I'm pretty good at this shit.
[180:13.87]Multiple goals.
[180:14.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[180:21.07]I get you.

[181:27.41]I like this.
[181:27.93]This is fun.
[181:28.49]What a fucking terrible game.
[181:53.21]No!
[181:54.03]Yeah!
[181:55.66]No.
[182:34.18]You guys fucked it up.
[182:34.98]Hold on.
[182:35.52]Just my face?
[182:52.86]That's got to be bigger so you guys can actually click on it.
[183:06.65]Where am I?
[183:14.81]Fuck idiots.
[183:30.60]You do a dick on my face one more time.
[183:37.38]And I'll play chess again for the next six hours.
[183:40.62]Is that what you want?
[183:53.01]Holy shit.
[183:53.83]Wow.
[183:54.31]You're actually listening.
[183:55.09]Alright.
[183:55.33]Let's get one more time.
[183:56.95]Nice and close.
[184:23.87]Now you lose privileges for the next 10 years.
[184:28.04]What?
[184:30.64]I turned it off.
[184:36.48]Oh, it's because it's on the other scene.
[184:37.76]I get it.
[184:38.22]Okay.
[184:40.08]Where are we going?
[184:46.13]That was a car in the lot.
[184:51.45]Bust Out 3D World.
[185:04.87]Is it a... Well... Bust Out 3D World or Alchemy Drop.
[185:17.53]Okay.
[185:19.07]Looks like Alchemy Drop...
[185:25.35]Let's play Alchemy Drop.
[185:26.43]Sure.
[185:27.28]Alchemy Drop.
[185:28.26]Can I say that in a different tone or is it the same audio clip?
[185:32.12]Alchemy Drop.
[185:33.46]Alchemy Drop.
[185:34.20]Alchemy Drop.
[185:34.92]Alchemy Drop.
[185:35.50]I can't do it.
[185:36.66]Alchemy Drop.
[185:41.67]Alchemy Drop.
[185:42.27]There we go.
[185:43.25]Finally.
[185:43.65]Jesus.
[185:47.83]Alchemy Drop.
[185:48.27]Alchemy Drop.
[185:51.25]I know, this is going to be a match-three game.
[185:52.75]We're going to be quitting it in two seconds.
[185:54.73]I'm reliving the nightmare I had last time.
[185:57.61]In real time, live, on camera.
[186:03.90]Fuck.
[186:49.80]I can't believe I'm doing this shit again.
[186:51.70]If you had told me three years ago that fast forward a couple of years and there was going to be another edition of this game that was supposed to be different and it was the same thing and I'm doing it again.
[187:10.57]Bust out world.
[187:11.45]Alright.
[187:12.83]It's time to start picking them myself for the next couple of rounds.
[187:19.93]Because everybody wants to put a little dinky on the screen.
[187:22.47]Alright, let's go.
[187:27.40]Bust out 3D World.
[187:28.56]It's a 3D game.
[187:29.40]That means it's not going to work.
[187:34.18]You can try it, though.
[187:38.27]Doesn't work.
[187:42.23]At least we're going through it quicker, because the ones that... I wonder if it's the same ones that don't work.
[187:47.80]That would be hilarious, actually.
[187:49.02]I need to go watch that video after this.
[188:05.69]Farmer Crates is 3D, and it works, and it's from the video.
[188:15.25]Take us back.
[188:24.00]Oh, Jerma, you really cashed in on that video you made.
[188:27.08]Alright, we're going to play Farmer Crates.
[188:40.36]Did I get this game for one cent?
[188:41.70]I got this game for, I think it was $11.
[188:47.77]Farmer Crates did work in the last timeline.
[188:52.39]So let's see if it works in this one.
[188:53.55]Of course it does.
[188:58.65]Because this is the exact same collection.
[189:02.05]And why is it opening on my other monitor?
[189:07.09]I am so confused.
[189:07.93]It's opening on my right monitor right now.
[189:11.43]This is not correct.
[189:15.27]So I'm going to put it into windowed.
[189:21.79]Okay.
[189:22.51]Well... There's... There it is.
[189:32.64]It's another song.
[189:36.14]I don't know what it is.
[189:38.98]I don't want to play this again.
[189:43.83]Can I skip... Can I veto this one?
[189:45.59]Because I've already done it.
[189:46.63]I already know what this one is.
[189:48.39]I've already played this one.
[189:51.48]Wow, look at that face that guy has.
[189:53.70]It's a really scary face.
[189:56.94]He looks like a character from the Dark Crystal.
[190:00.12]I don't know whatever I said.
[190:01.02]Some reference.
[190:03.54]Joe, that's fine.
[190:04.86]I've done it.
[190:08.30]You've played all of them.
[190:09.46]Not all of them.
[190:10.03]Some of these didn't work.
[190:11.77]Some of these actually did not open.
[190:13.81]A lot of them didn't.
[190:22.09]Deja vu.
[190:24.57]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good reference, right.
[190:26.93]What is that?
[190:35.24]Three, two, one.
[190:38.26]And what is going on with this guy's work outfit?
[190:41.99]What?
[190:42.33]This guy puts on overalls and shoes to go to work, and he's naked.
[190:59.43]And three, two, one.
[191:01.19]I mean, three, two, one.
[191:05.03]I mean, like, this guy belongs in a different video game.
[191:09.30]You know, he belongs in the Dark Crystal from the Muppets.
[191:27.36]I don't have any- I don't know what else to say.
[191:34.99]No, I fucked it up.
[191:38.27]Nooo!

[192:21.36]It was going to be a different thing, but it's just, no, no, no.
[192:24.14]It is a big deal.
[192:24.90]It is a big deal.
[192:34.61]And you guys thought that was it.

[205:38.80]You wanna fight?
[205:39.54]Don't fuck come at me!
[205:40.84]Don't!
[205:58.70]I went too far.
[206:00.35]I was looking at the camera.
[206:04.72]I actually fucked that one up.
[206:06.77]And that's alright.
[206:09.57]Hold on, I need to see that.
[206:11.29]I have to see that.
[206:12.15]That was a mistake.
[206:12.95]I didn't mean to do that one.
[206:17.39]My hand went too far.
[206:19.01]And I didn't react fast enough.
[206:20.53]Did that actually just... No, that wasn't the right one.
[206:24.34]Don't fuck about me.
[206:35.13]Holy shit.
[206:36.93]Oh my god, that actually just happened.
[206:39.51]Wow.
[206:41.37]Oh, you want to fight?
[206:42.15]You want to fucking fight?
[206:42.89]Don't fucking at me.
[206:44.19]Don't.
[206:48.91]Holy shit.
[206:50.71]Yeah, I did not actually mean to do that.
[206:55.01]I was trying to time it with the camera.
[206:56.77]That was me actually doing that.
[206:58.31]Oh, that was fun.
[207:01.21]I can't fucking believe that just happened.
[207:13.84]I was trying to do this joke where my hand comes all the way across and I turn and I turn and I didn't turn at the right time.
[207:26.53]Well, that was, uh, that was, uh... The worst part about that is the noise still happens.
[207:41.82]The fake joke noise still plays on top of it.
[207:56.49]Where the fuck is that?
[207:57.51]Unbelievable.
[208:01.45]I haven't even been drinking.
[208:02.66]I've had like coffee and food.

[211:02.65]Because I was pretending to miss the person in front of me and go around like a fucking Three Stooges video.
[211:09.15]And I actually did the Three Stooges thing in real life.
[211:22.21]So it looks like we're going to classic Pac-Man.

[211:37.26]I mean, how can I at this point?
[211:41.75]Alright, here we go.

[212:38.33]Don't go to that website.
[212:39.45]There's no reason for you to go to that website.
[212:55.10]Although Pac-Man, seriously, the fact that if you remove Pac-Man's eyes, he really is just fucking terrifying.
[213:08.48]What a scary fucking monster he really is with no eyes.
[213:22.10]Pac-Man didn't have eyes?
[213:24.16]Didn't he have a little like eye?
[213:25.42]Well, that's like a clay version.
[213:27.40]Maybe, did he not have eyes?
[213:41.37]No, he didn't.
[213:42.21]What was it?
[213:42.71]It was 1995 when they gave him eyes.
[213:47.79]Yeah, don't go to that website.
[213:49.33]I just told you not to go.
[213:50.37]Why would you go?
[213:53.00]Hey, I just went to that website and I fucked up my computer.

[215:10.96]I'm not sure.
[215:11.46]It could be anything.
[215:18.91]Strike Bowling?

[220:17.09]Mac grew up in 1960s when love, peace, freedom were the ideals of youth.
[220:23.30]At school, Mac was abused for everything, even for love to teach her Brown's daughter.
[220:31.43]You're good for nothing.
[220:33.73]Having finished school, Mac became an artist, but no one bought his paintings.
[220:39.10]In spite of bad luck, Mac decided to propose to Mary Brown, the teacher's daughter, if you forgot.
[220:44.22]And what a proposal without a ring, but here were no ways to get money.
[220:52.08]One day, a man in a Mac offered Mac good money for making some copies for him.

[247:23.92]With my help, these baby fish will grow to be beautiful adult specimens.
[247:30.91]This is the house you bought.

[250:46.96]Pet shop or daycare?
[250:50.06]Yeah, they pretty much come to your place for you to feed.
[250:53.94]I don't think you can do anything else.
[250:59.81]Turtles can't breathe underwater.
[251:01.15]Well, blame... Blame the people that made this game.
[251:05.43]I didn't make it.
[251:12.17]I had nothing to do with this.
[251:15.91]You did?
[251:16.35]Well, then you should have known better.
[251:21.62]See, he's fine.

[251:35.19]I don't know.
[251:51.36]Alright, let's have a little chat.
[251:53.08]Let's see where we are right now.

[253:04.86]Did he already play Farmer Crates?
[253:06.18]Oh yeah.
[253:06.66]If it's got an X on it, it means we already did it.
[253:14.18]Hmm.
[253:16.98]We seem to be very split.
[253:21.56]16% are clicking on one that has already been shown on screen.
[253:32.49]16% want.
[253:34.35]Oh, it's close.

[253:43.10]But these are already done.
[253:44.26]Why are you guys clicking over here?
[253:46.90]Should I even ask that question?
[253:48.81]Stone Age Taxi.
[253:49.73]There it is.
[253:50.25]Alright, let's go.
[253:58.25]That is in the first pack.
[254:02.31]Stone Age Taxi.
[254:07.37]No, it's not the first pack.
[254:08.49]What fucking pack is this in?
[254:12.37]This one.
[254:16.95]We played this one already.
[254:21.70]Oh, got him.
[254:24.44]Got him.

[254:57.98]Not good.
[254:59.64]Mm-mm.
[255:03.84]Don't do it to us.
[255:05.46]Wow.
[255:06.62]Why is it to click?
[255:24.61]I can't even... No, what is this, like, doing?
[255:26.95]Get off!
[255:27.43]Get... What are you doing?
[255:31.96]It took over my whole computer again.
[255:42.98]Leaked.
[255:44.04]Yeah, I leaked out, like, the menu.
[255:50.98]Oh, there's this... There's nothing there.
[255:57.20]This might... Maybe you might have seen my recycling bin.
[256:00.34]What's going on back here?
[256:36.30]I hate that I have to do this.
[256:43.56]What a crock of shit.
[256:44.62]Alright, here we go.
[256:48.00]I've played this one.
[256:53.30]Kid mode.
[256:57.50]Remember this one?
[257:01.15]I do.
[257:04.48]You can run the people over and shit.
[257:06.22]If I remember it... What reference can I make?
[257:16.65]Oh, in kid mode you can't kill the cavemen.
[257:19.03]You can kill them in the adult mode.
[257:22.45]Thanks.
[257:36.31]Thanks.
[257:36.97]You're welcome.
[257:38.27]How's this for kid mode?
[257:40.57]Nope, can't do it.
[258:06.93]Wanna see the difference?
[258:08.35]Here's the difference.
[258:20.60]There's the difference.
[258:23.04]They were really concerned about kids running people over, apparently.
[258:30.84]God damn it, these all suck so bad.
[258:34.64]Oh, what about the kids?
[258:36.24]We have to take care of the kids.
[258:43.56]It's down here.
[259:01.21]Hmm.
[259:01.85]Tennis champion.
[259:02.71]Penguin push.
[259:17.09]uh looks like we're gonna do oh it's kind of I don't know tennis is this big head tennis yeah this is probably big head tennis from what I remember this is what you waited for ladies and gentlemen that's right big head tennis
[259:48.61]You guys always try to find a way to slip in that thing.
[259:56.81]Alright, let's put it on tennis championship.
[260:04.41]No.
[260:04.53]No, I don't know what this means.
[260:06.57]So I'm not going to do that.
[260:13.95]I don't know.
[260:14.55]Why does it need that?
[260:24.38]Direct play.
[260:34.43]It's safe?
[260:36.07]Skip installation.
[260:45.16]No, it's going to sit there for fucking 10 minutes and install it.
[260:52.19]Why did I just teleport?
[260:53.99]Skip.
[261:18.28]That's just... That's not a monster.
[261:21.81]Sideburns?
[261:23.39]They're fine.
[261:30.47]They're fine.
[261:31.19]They're correct.
[261:35.01]The closet opened on its own.
[261:36.67]Oh, it did it now.
[261:37.68]Did the closet open on its own?
[261:45.96]They're not two different lengths.
[261:49.82]It did.
[261:50.59]The closet opened on its own.
[261:52.45]Show me a clip.
[262:02.10]They actually are uneven.
[262:03.46]Bullshit.
[262:03.92]No, they're not.
[262:18.26]That's just the way that my face is shaped.
[262:22.26]See, there's just less hair here.
[262:24.06]I have to get my hair cut.
[262:24.94]Look.
[262:26.52]Look at the ear.
[262:27.64]Right here on the ear.
[262:28.94]Right there.
[262:30.52]Look at the ear.
[262:33.08]Right there.
[262:34.40]See?
[262:37.36]They're even.
[262:37.94]He's so bald.
[262:53.22]could you call this so bald I mean it's I'm receding but it's not don't let him get to you don't let him get to you I'll do two hands this time and go around and hit both cheeks I almost did it again and here's how that happened I figured it out so I'm looking at the preview right now because well I'm looking at the preview I was gauging how far I almost did it again because I can't gauge the distance by looking at the preview on the screen
[263:22.91]Can you imagine if I fucking just smashed both sides of my face right there?
[263:29.84]For the love of God.
[263:30.74]Alright.
[263:36.89]Anyways, uneven bald spots.
[263:40.53]That's fine.
[263:41.11]Who just gave bits?
[263:41.74]Who are you?
[263:46.76]The guy on the tennis championship icon is just you when you were doing the green screen walk, but someone has edited a tennis racket into your hand.
[264:21.63]That's fucking funny.
[264:25.33]Well, tennis doesn't work.
[264:27.02]Okay, why is it?
[264:27.94]Because Windows 10.
[264:29.42]And I did all this shit to, whatever.
[264:32.82]Tennis walk doesn't work.
[264:34.02]Where are we heading?
[264:55.63]Might be Penguin Push.
[264:58.25]Possible that it might be Airstrike.
[265:03.21]Maybe the Doctor Lab.
[265:04.68]Looks like it's going to be Penguin Push.
[265:21.22]If it's, uh, when we do jewel wizardry, I'm gonna do the line.
[265:26.92]Oh, fuck.
[265:27.88]Is it, did I just, no, it's gonna, it's penguin push.
[265:30.26]No, it's not.
[265:30.94]What the fuck?
[265:39.31]Well, we might as well get it out of the way.
[265:42.05]I feel like I'm doing stand-up.
[265:45.85]Remember I told you how I have a tour of the country with my popular video?
[265:52.27]I just get up on the stage and I'm just like, ladies and gentlemen.
[265:57.73]Yeah.
[266:06.00]I got the mic in my hand.
[266:06.78]I'm just like, so, you know, how are you guys doing?
[266:10.12]You guys doing good?
[266:14.08]Yeah.
[266:14.46]Wizardry.
[266:16.74]That's what I'm doing right now.
[266:18.58]This is like the fifth or sixth town I've been to.
[266:30.33]Okay.
[266:32.05]I'll do it.
[266:39.40]I wonder if I can get the whole thing correct.
[266:44.85]In fact, let's see.
[266:46.35]Let's see if I can get it.
[266:47.87]Jewel Wizardry.
[266:51.57]Give me a moment, though.
[266:52.21]I need to queue this up.
[267:04.86]Alright, where is it?
[267:13.26]Raid.
[267:15.65]How could you not like it?
[267:19.89]See?
[267:20.23]Look.
[267:21.13]Remember this part?
[267:23.47]I can't stop it.
[267:25.19]See?
[267:26.19]The same thing happened.
[267:31.31]So, you know, this is real.
[267:36.29]Butch is doing the video again.
[267:37.61]Alright, where... Where's Jewel Wizardry?
[267:44.98]Where is Jewel?
[267:45.52]There it is.
[267:46.68]See if I can get this.
[267:51.66]Here we go.
[267:52.08]Okay.
[267:52.36]I'm going to try.
[267:56.84]Make sure you can hear it.
[267:59.41]I haven't seen this video in a long time.
[268:01.23]I think I know what I said though.
[268:06.97]Incoming Jewel wizardry.
[268:19.99]Okay.
[268:34.69]You gonna do it?
[268:38.41]What the fuck are you doing?
[268:40.72]You're telling me Jewel Wizardry is not even gonna open?
[268:46.04]You gotta be kidding me.
[268:50.16]I... Where is it?
[268:52.63]I don't see it anywhere.
[269:30.33]What is this?
[269:31.27]What are you linking here?
[269:36.99]What are you linking?
[269:38.85]What is this?
[269:40.59]I'm not going to look at that on camera.
[269:46.74]I need to make sure you guys can see this.
[269:51.86]Alright, I'm just gonna go.
[269:52.96]Here we go.
[269:56.52]Can I get it?
[270:00.92]A classic game of dual wizardry.
[270:05.64]If you think you're powerful enough to cut my challenger road, I'll wear a fucking red dress and a Diablo II paladin scepter.
[270:18.93]I did it kind of good.
[270:20.69]Oh, I get it.
[270:21.21]I actually get it.
[270:22.07]I get it That's close enough He hasn't changed at all not quite Oh
[270:48.28]Can I like oh hold on god damn it, let's try this again I'll get I'll get the whole thing this time Oh, I gotta wait till it's ready
[271:16.65]Okay, let's do it again.
[271:19.35]No, never mind.
[271:19.79]We're not doing that again.
[271:22.71]Oh, it's a classic.
[271:23.73]The classic game of Jew Wizardry.
[271:28.85]ASDF.
[271:31.40]Was it the same in the video?
[271:38.16]Because that would be very, very strange.
[271:40.24]Yes, it was.
[271:46.81]what no way no that has to be default because I'm on a different computer on a different internet in a different state
[272:19.22]Oh, okay.
[272:19.68]Oh, I get it.
[272:20.20]Oh, okay.
[272:27.50]Oh, I get it.
[272:28.38]Oh, it's kind of cool.
[272:29.60]Nice.
[272:34.45]Oh, okay.
[272:42.25]I get it.
[273:14.11]I fucked it up.
[273:14.63]There's a bonus inside this triangle.
[273:17.23]I can't get it out.
[273:21.38]Oh, okay.
[273:21.74]I get it.
[273:22.08]It's actually kind of fun.
[273:49.11]Nice.
[273:49.39]Quick, use the Diablo II Paladin Scepter.
[273:57.03]What does this do, then?
[274:20.72]Not doing anyone.
[275:15.36]This actually might be the most interesting game on this whole thing.
[275:19.82]I think I did say that.
[275:20.70]Let's just repeat the same video, the same thing.
[275:25.33]Come on, Jeremy!
[275:27.11]Say it!
[275:29.35]Bonus.
[275:30.63]Can't use it yet.
[275:34.33]Aquarium Shop was the best?
[275:37.88]I think I might have to disagree with you there.
[275:41.52]I don't like the time management bullshit.
[275:56.89]What about Jail Run?
[275:58.87]Nah, that game sucked too.
[276:03.77]Jewel Wizardry is actually pretty great.
[276:07.33]You know, for its time... I think it was kind of way ahead of its time.
[276:16.66]See, they took the game Tetris that they didn't make.
[276:39.82]Got it.
[276:41.28]Come on, hurry up.
[276:46.64]Hurry up.
[276:48.54]Nice.
[276:52.77]Pretty good.
[276:55.13]Is this a sponsored stream?
[277:02.53]I'll let you be the judge.
[277:41.96]That was good That was jewel wizardry just like the remember the last time we did it it was so much fun
[277:57.81]You're too old.
[277:58.43]That's why you like mom games.
[278:04.17]Mom games?
[278:10.48]I don't even know what that means.
[278:18.85]Could have guessed that the next one was going to be Penguin Push.
[278:27.13]What games does your mom play?
[278:28.56]My mom doesn't play any games.
[278:44.12]Why?
[278:45.60]Because, I don't know, she doesn't play video games.
[278:52.75]She's not a gamer.
[278:55.68]I'm trying to think of the last game.
[278:57.00]You know what?
[278:57.42]The last game that my mother played was Grand Theft Auto 3.
[279:02.94]Because we were like, Mom, you try.
[279:04.83]And she was like, I don't know about this.
[279:06.15]This seems crazy.
[279:08.55]And then she smashed into a wall and she got scared.
[279:14.33]So she never did it again.
[279:15.11]Alright, Penguin Push.
[279:28.54]Ugh, God, give me a break.
[280:09.13]Is direct play safe to enable?
[280:12.89]Let's see.
[280:25.65]Is direct play safe now?
[280:28.90]Is it safe now?
[280:32.10]What do you mean now?
[280:39.79]Uh, badges, I don't trust this bullshit.
[280:42.29]I can't host using sockets because I run ICS as well.
[280:49.97]You mean that disk erasing effect?
[280:51.69]I think that was fixed ages ago.
[280:55.05]What?
[280:58.34]Why is that so scary?
[281:03.80]Is that correct?
[281:14.64]Alright, this is on... Once installed, it won't cause a VAC BAM and I play other games, right?
[281:23.02]And somebody writes, uh, DirectPlay is an API inside of DirectX.
[281:27.20]It shouldn't cause any issues with other games.
[281:37.09]I'm gonna fucking crash my goddamn entire PC.
[281:40.95]Install.
[281:42.59]It's installing right now.
[281:53.95]Did it work?
[281:56.45]Oh, fuck.
[281:57.31]What happened?
[281:58.19]Are we good?
[282:02.53]Penguin Puffer!
[282:56.78]It's too much.
[282:58.38]Playing is easy.
[282:59.26]You and a friend play penguins who have to escape the nasty Eskimos and their pets.
[283:03.41]You move through the levels by squashing all the Eskimos and their pets.
[283:06.47]You do this by pushing blocks.
[283:09.47]There are four different enemies to watch out for.
[283:14.85]Pushing the ice blocks.
[283:22.00]This is just- I'm at a concert and the guy on the piano got way too into it.
[283:25.55]What happened?
[283:52.36]Come on, let's see those hands!
[284:32.10]What happened?
[284:35.14]I think I broke something.
[284:55.14]Nope, I'm not doing that.
[284:56.88]That would have been really bad.
[284:58.00]I have shorts on.
[285:10.96]I ain't having another slap moment on this stream.
[285:14.02]End tutorial.
[285:19.87]I was gonna go like this with my feet like dun dun dun.
[285:22.89]No fucking way.
[285:24.63]Not right now.
[285:26.39]What happened?
[285:31.34]80 levels.
[285:31.94]80 games in this month.
[285:46.49]Watch this, watch this!
[285:49.01]Ah!
[285:49.99]Oh, I get it!
[285:51.91]It's Kenny, from South Park.
[285:57.22]I'm trying to get the mouse off the screen.
[286:17.99]Shh, fuck.
[286:18.59]Wait, I can go through.
[287:02.14]I'm so glad I didn't just show, like, my fucking legs.
[287:05.44]Somebody would have freeze-framed and it would have been... I would have gotten banned from Twitch forever.
[287:12.31]All it takes is one guy to, like... One guy just has to freeze-frame the exact second that I, like, turn my legs over with shorts on and all of a sudden you're gone.
[287:24.44]I can't have that.
[287:25.14]We live in the fucking digital age.
[287:29.42]Where was this?
[287:34.95]Yeah, no, one guy.
[287:55.28]Diner drop?
[287:56.20]I veto that one.
[287:56.94]It's going to be Diner Dash, but a different name.
[288:04.37]What is this?
[288:18.67]Oh, look, we're going to put the penis.
[288:21.01]Hey, hey, what do you think we should do?
[288:22.51]Hey, hey, hey, chat, hey, what do you want to do?
[288:24.79]Hey, shh, don't tell him.

[288:29.12]Hey, wait, don't tell him.
[288:34.40]I'm turning on diner drop.
[288:44.30]I thought something went wrong and it's free.
[288:47.36]Refuse to say the website dot com.
[288:50.84]That's not it.
[288:51.42]That's my face.
[288:54.03]There it is.
[289:00.49]Do you really give a shit if this is not in the right spot?
[289:02.31]I don't think anybody does.
[289:06.05]Yeah, come on.
[289:06.87]This is a... You're running a stream here.
[289:10.10]Well, what?
[289:21.16]Simple moves.
[289:21.86]Get three or more identical food items in a row and they will disappear.
[289:25.18]You may swap adjacent elements if you swap the elements, but the elements don't appear.
[289:28.43]They will return back to their original place unless Spry is... The objective of this game is mode is to clear the entire field of time.
[289:36.21]If you gather four or five identical food items, you'll be ready with money.
[289:38.69]Okay, double-dub.
[289:41.35]There's so much information that I don't... Who's going to read this?
[289:44.59]There's so much.
[289:47.18]It's still going.
[289:49.64]There's a lot of tutorials here.
[290:00.98]Cool.
[290:03.22]It's one of these games.
[290:05.02]So we've got cheese danishes, cheese hot dogs.
[290:09.15]Three ice cream cones.
[290:10.87]That's a fucking rotten... That's a rotten bun.
[290:15.83]There's no such thing as a sesame seed hot dog bun.
[290:18.61]Is there?
[290:18.91]I don't think there is.
[290:22.60]Is there a sesame seed hot dog bun?
[290:28.08]Okay.
[290:31.85]There is?
[290:32.23]I've never seen it in my 38 years of life.
[290:54.95]Ever tell you guys the story of how I spent probably 37 or 38 dollars of my life on one of these games?
[291:14.79]I played one of these and I spent like 38 bucks.
[291:20.18]I played it for like a year.
[291:25.04]I forget what it's called.
[291:28.52]It was like Mystery Gem Drop or something, and it was this fake, stupid, where you solve mysteries, but you don't, it's just a match-three game, and I don't know why I did it.
[291:38.87]There's no reason to.
[291:47.24]No, it wasn't Bejeweled.
[291:51.33]No, it wasn't.
[291:52.77]It wasn't.
[291:53.63]It was not that.
[292:02.80]Scream.
[292:04.18]Got it.
[292:05.10]Only one more tile to clear.
[292:11.12]Order and pickup text is outside the box.
[292:20.09]You just don't care at that point.
[292:22.57]You don't care.
[292:24.35]How could you care?
[292:25.09]It's just... That's just so... You just don't... You don't even mind that that's there.
[292:41.87]Come on!
[292:43.23]Come on!
[292:43.67]Oh, wow!
[293:04.02]Why would I play that game?
[293:05.45]In fact, why am I playing this one?
[293:11.95]That was... That was Commander Crunch.
[293:17.31]Diner Drop.
[293:29.89]airstrike I guarantee this one doesn't work I'm gonna I mean it's pretty unanimous right now I I 100 guarantee I'll try it I have 699 000 games left to play I gotta pick up the pace well what needs to happen
[293:59.67]is yeah I gotta pick up the face you're right I'm gonna just close it for now just in case it flashes on the screen I'm ready
[294:26.73]How to play.
[294:27.77]The year 19XX, so fill in the blank there.
[294:32.87]Third Reich has cloned thousands of zombie pilots in secret labs to support the plan of conquering the world.
[294:38.66]Opening the way to bring the world down and to stop the Nazi and defeat their entities, the Allied commander has called up three pilots in order to destroy the enemy at any cost.
[294:52.86]Skyfire.
[294:57.97]Rae, Annie, or Wolf?
[294:59.49]I won't speed.
[295:01.05]How do you play?
[295:03.75]Oh, like that.
[295:07.13]It's just Raiden.
[295:10.50]I'm sorry, Raiden 2.
[295:11.90]Raiden 2.
[295:12.26]Yeah, it's a shmup.
[295:25.43]Except not really because it's running at about 22 frames a second.
[295:32.00]It's hard to have a shmup when the game runs like this.
[295:38.76]Why don't they put this shit in cereal anymore?
[295:49.62]Really.
[295:51.04]Is there a reason they stopped doing that?
[295:54.35]Just contact this company.
[295:56.81]Fucking Frost and Flakes.
[295:58.87]And replace this with... Tony the Tiger.
[296:03.47]You know how easy that would be?
[296:08.07]You know how cool everyone would think that was?
[296:18.02]How about that be like Snap, Crackle, Puck?
[296:25.46]We're going one life.
[296:29.59]There are 25 enemies left.
[296:30.85]I can get them.
[296:32.35]Let's play well.
[296:33.41]Oh my god, come on.
[296:39.51]Yeah, Tony the Tiger against the Nazis.
[296:46.48]Yeah.
[296:52.99]Are you telling me you don't think that that would be worth playing?
[296:55.69]It would definitely be.
[296:58.43]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[297:20.70]Alright, I win.
[297:21.52]What do I get?
[297:21.98]How did I get to level three?
[297:25.97]This isn't worth playing, but it is worth playing if it was for free in a cereal box.
[297:35.84]This can't be worth more money to make than the same Hot Wheels car every year.
[297:45.07]You know how much it was probably to license Frozen from Disney to put in the fucking Happy Meals?
[297:51.38]If they had just... Well, I was gonna say put Elsa in here, but now they need Disney licensing.
[298:00.00]Forget about the licensing.
[298:01.51]Just put a piece of cereal here.
[298:03.93]You don't have to have a licensed character.
[298:08.45]If it's Corn Flakes, put the fucking rooster on here.
[298:11.09]Who cares?
[298:12.99]You don't need a licensed Disney character.
[298:14.79]Put Ronald McDonald on here.
[298:25.01]Cornflakes are disgusting.
[298:26.55]Let me just talk about that real quick.
[298:33.85]You know, I would rather slap myself in the face than eat cornflakes.
[298:41.36]They're good?
[298:41.80]How could you say something like that?
[298:43.16]They're not.
[298:47.23]They just, they smell.
[298:48.21]Have you ever smelled cornflakes?
[298:50.85]Pour some milk on a bowl of cornflakes and smell it.
[298:54.05]I guarantee you're gonna go.
[298:55.25]That's kind of, that's disgusting.
[298:56.49]What the hell am I eating?
[299:07.40]So you'd rather shit yourself than eat cornflakes.
[299:09.60]That's not what I said.
[299:16.25]Yeah, it smells like sour.
[299:18.17]Kind of like cheese, like rotten cheese.
[299:21.49]Every time I put milk on it, I don't know what it is.
[299:23.67]It's something weird.
[299:24.45]Where are we going?
[299:45.96]Oops.
[299:48.24]Sorry.
[299:55.09]Spoiled milk joke.
[299:56.27]Minus 20.
[299:56.63]Yeah.
[299:57.77]Yeah, I can see that.
[300:03.51]Alright, doctor lab or tomb raider?
[300:07.04]Tomb bomber.
[300:12.14]I think we're going to the doctor lab.
[300:21.27]Don't tell him we're making penis.
[300:28.81]Somebody just leaned in really close.
[300:30.63]Clicked on the penis spot and went... Right into the screen.
[300:37.89]Alright, doctor's lab.
[300:38.78]Let's go.
[300:45.80]Doctor's lab.
[300:46.64]This is going to be Dr. Mario.
[301:00.29]Yeah, that's a total... How does Nintendo let him get away with that?
[301:08.73]That's very clearly the guy from Dr. Mario.
[301:17.29]Use system memory.
[301:24.85]Funny story, I don't even know how to play Dr. Mario.
[301:27.42]I have no idea.
[301:34.80]Dr. Smith.
[301:36.32]My laboratory got attacked by malicious viruses.
[301:38.28]I have no idea how to do this.
[301:44.64]Does it sound like we connect the two?
[301:50.15]We have to connect red to red, right?
[301:52.09]Like jumping a car?
[301:59.59]Dude, this is just Dr. Mario.
[302:00.95]This is Dr. Mario.
[302:02.25]That's just Mario when he's 60, 70.
[302:05.07]Mario is supposed to be like 70, isn't he?
[302:06.84]Oh, fuck.
[302:09.52]It's hard to control.
[302:56.92]You gotta give them credit though.
[302:58.24]They just don't give a shit if they get sued.
[303:02.20]Why would that ever happen?
[303:08.32]Do you think it would ever happen?
[303:10.08]I'm not sure it would.
[303:28.87]Just put whatever song you- I can't- I- I'm trying.
[303:33.63]It's hard to control.
[303:34.89]Up is the only thing that changes it.
[303:38.76]That's gonna be something.
[303:39.64]There it is!
[303:44.22]Ah, it's so hard!
[303:45.06]You don't understand, it's like this input lag trying to move these.
[303:50.22]Trust me.
[303:55.19]Oh my god, I pressed it twice!
[304:04.45]I feel like I'm playing this underwater.
[304:17.66]Come on, queue it up.
[304:21.12]Oh my god, it's...
[304:51.77]That was at least a half second delay when I pressed a button.
[304:57.55]At least.
[304:59.22]Had to have been.
[305:08.04]Uh, Pharaoh's Challenge.
[305:10.88]No, people have decided to change their minds.
[305:18.71]The band's going to sue me?
[305:19.77]They're not going to sue me.
[305:20.61]They're going to sue... I don't even know what company this is.
[305:30.17]When will we play the 700,000th game?
[305:38.78]Stop linking this flap.
[305:42.06]It reminds me every time and it brings me back there.
[305:46.94]That's the, that's, that's, you know what that is?
[305:49.86]That's 2019 snort.
[305:52.86]That's definitely what that is, and it's way worse.
[306:00.57]I am going to click on clips for the next year.
[306:02.93]It's gonna be like, hey dude, uh, I saw this, uh, funny clip that you should check out, and it's gonna be this lap.
[306:08.23]Just, just replace it.
[306:10.31]Snort, replace it.
[306:17.72]Alright, we're going to Adam Bomber.
[306:22.20]Adam Bomber.
[306:26.34]Thank you for voting.
[306:28.35]I really appreciate it.
[306:30.49]Adam Bomber doesn't work.
[306:31.35]Thank you for voting.
[306:32.57]Appreciate it.
[306:34.09]It's a good attempt.

[306:59.80]Don't eat fish.
[307:00.84]It's toxic.
[307:07.12]What are you talking about?
[307:13.88]Somebody just bursted through the door and just screamed.
[307:17.32]Don't eat it!
[307:23.03]Uh, Book of Thanos has one.

[320:04.21]Ooh, that's as good as it's gonna get.
[320:10.61]Timmy.
[320:12.34]Male, be human.
[320:14.96]You can be what other species?
[320:18.06]You can be like a dog?
[320:19.04]Why would they be something else besides humans?
[320:21.70]I don't know how to play.
[320:45.76]Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Z, X, A, C, B, space, space.
[320:57.89]Cursor up!
[321:01.65]No!
[321:02.37]What the fuck is going on?
[321:09.95]Oh no.
[321:20.40]I have to make it random shit.
[322:04.31]I'm fucking so mad.
[322:05.45]I don't know what it is about tennis.
[322:07.16]Tennis just fucking enrages me.
[322:10.46]It makes me so angry.
[322:13.12]I don't know what it is about it.
[322:14.18]Got it.
[322:36.01]Look at how long that hair is.
[322:41.75]I didn't hit that.
[322:42.66]Oh my god.
[322:46.62]Fucking tennis.
[322:59.17]Oops.
[323:03.90]Say the line.
[323:04.60]Oh, I can't do it until I serve.
[323:14.59]Who coughed?
[323:19.03]How come she doesn't even need to move?
[323:22.51]This is not fair.
[323:23.49]Everything I do goes right in the middle.
[323:25.02]She doesn't have to move.
[323:26.78]I have to move.
[323:35.53]I keep hitting it to her.
[323:36.93]How am I supposed to not hit it?
[323:41.57]I'm hitting it straight in the middle.
[323:44.83]Alright, listen.
[323:47.27]There is no way that I'm going to be told I'm doing something wrong in a cereal box tennis game.
[323:56.29]And there we go.
[324:03.15]And here we go.
[324:04.45]Big Head Dennis.
[324:06.33]This is what you came for.
[324:07.09]It's not going to work until later.
[324:14.49]Big Head Dennis.
[324:16.09]This is what you came for, ladies and gentlemen.
[324:17.93]Big Head Dennis.
[324:20.45]See?
[324:20.91]I did it.
[324:21.29]I did the line.
[324:22.67]You're going to stop booing me.
[324:30.76]There's only space.
[324:38.92]I can't aim where this even serves to just goes to right to her You're so bad
[325:05.15]You can't, you can't, you can't be bad at tennis championship on 700,000 games.
[325:17.99]It's not possible.
[325:19.17]There's one action.
[325:20.71]There's swing and there's walk through mud.
[325:25.71]There's no such thing as being bad at a game like... I just splashed liquid on my face.
[325:32.92]You suck at tennis.
[325:34.88]I'll see me in real tennis.
[325:37.82]I just fucking kick back and smash it as hard as I can and just go soaring over everybody.
[325:46.56]You know, they properly throw it and it's just fucking, I just hit it as hard as I can and try to hit it like out of the ballpark.
[325:53.37]You're going to be like, everybody fucking gasps.
[326:06.04]Touch your screen, please.
[326:07.67]Oh my god.
[326:15.79]Why did I do that?
[326:20.20]I get it.
[326:21.24]Come on, do it for me.
[326:23.04]I know you guys are capable of doing this, so... Are you capable of this?
[326:45.85]You guys are not even capable.
[326:47.35]Really?
[326:47.61]You're supposed to be touching when I touch so it looks cool.
[326:59.11]I'll give you one more chance.
[327:13.64]I'm done with it.
[327:27.34]This is too much of a delay.
[327:30.47]It's like a four second delay.
[327:33.01]There was a 55% click on my mouth.
[327:35.88]So you can't, come on.
[327:37.56]You can't tell me that I'm bad at tennis when it came from this game.
[327:54.50]We're going to space something?
[327:56.72]Space Crusaders?
[328:00.22]How long is this stream?
[328:01.56]This is almost five and a half hours.
[328:03.72]Oh my god.
[328:07.20]At least we can say we did this.
[328:11.04]I've been watching all night for this.
[328:13.14]Well, I hope it turns on because it might not even work.
[328:17.22]I hope it works too.
[328:18.60]For your sake.
[328:19.68]I really do.
[328:56.41]Doesn't work.
[329:04.18]I'm so sorry.
[329:14.72]What's even left?
[329:15.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[329:16.12]We've got about 30% left.
[329:17.36]25.
[329:17.38]Maybe like another hour or so.
[329:36.82]So it looks as a foosball champ, this 3D in this one.
[329:44.14]Running them in compatibility mode.
[329:45.88]The whole thing is set for compatibility mode for Windows 7.
[329:50.30]That's what is recommended.
[329:54.78]The whole thing is in compatibility mode already.
[329:59.51]And as administrator.
[330:03.67]Alright, foosball 3D.
[330:06.72]3D in the title.
[330:09.76]And there is 3D in the title.
[330:11.98]Therefore, foosball champion does not open.
[330:36.85]Wait a goddamn second.
[330:44.00]Wait a second.
[330:46.46]I need to find out this once and for all.
[330:50.93]Hold on.
[331:00.39]So this is game pack volume 5 and 6.
[331:02.88]5 and 6.
[331:05.19]And that game was called Foosball Champion 3D.
[331:11.11]It's in here.
[331:13.21]So what the hell?
[331:15.51]I thought it was going to be an empty folder.
[331:22.83]Desk was making sure it was an empty... The door is moving.
[331:27.15]No, it's not an empty folder.
[331:28.06]It just doesn't work.
[331:31.38]Damn.
[331:31.92]That's not fucking cool.
[331:34.26]Try again.
[331:41.20]Boozeball 3D.
[331:51.95]Little Herder will work.
[331:57.43]The closet.
[331:58.05]What the fuck?
[331:59.98]I don't even know what the fuck you guys are talking about.
[332:03.80]Ow.

[332:05.66]This is actually really close.
[332:16.19]We'll have to see.
[332:16.81]24!
[332:19.95]Wow, this is close!
[332:21.75]I can't stop it yet.
[332:45.30]Damn.
[332:51.64]31 to 35.
[333:16.01]We'll hurt her.
[333:17.81]Alright, looks like Bob.

[333:45.56]Open.
[333:51.06]Does it work?
[333:55.35]Why are we getting so unlucky in a row?
[333:57.29]It doesn't work.
[333:59.97]Helicopter Bob doesn't work.
[334:08.31]How?
[334:11.01]Why?

[335:26.50]It just isn't going to work.
[335:32.74]That's unfortunate.
[335:36.79]Let me get that back on the screen.
[335:38.49]Try again.
[335:40.33]We're eliminating a lot of these.
[335:43.37]Where the hell is it?
[335:48.37]Eight, right?
[335:48.95]It's down here.
[335:50.93]Hella quick.

[341:43.26]Down here?
[341:45.44]Over this way, I think.
[341:46.18]Maybe down this way or this way.
[341:57.15]I've never seen a consensus like this, and it broke.
[342:06.80]I just had to say it.
[342:08.67]Hmm.
[342:11.27]Okay.
[342:15.07]Okay.
[342:20.64]You guys might have a good play down here if you get a couple down here.
[342:28.49]Because I'm going diagonal here so you can get a block right here.
[342:40.63]Hmm.

[349:42.31]Alright, fine.
[349:54.98]You sure?

[350:15.18]Eddie, you want to go here?
[350:16.44]Oh, boy.
[350:20.68]That's actually a pretty smart play.
[350:21.78]You should do it.
[350:23.14]Please go there.
[350:24.40]Absolutely click that.
[350:26.02]Do not change your mind.
[350:26.90]Click right there.
[350:34.10]I was trying to help a little bit.
[350:49.98]Four up!
[351:21.15]What are you going to do?
[351:34.60]Okay.
[351:34.72]And that's it.
[351:50.31]Congratulations, chat.
[351:53.50]You lost.
[352:05.69]I would play the rest of this out, but is it even really worth it?
[352:08.15]Should I?
[352:31.05]Okay.
[353:18.47]That was fun to play together.
[353:20.05]It was a draw.
[353:37.21]Rematch?
[353:38.77]OK, fine.
[353:39.51]One rematch, and that's it.
[353:42.27]I'll go first.
[353:45.83]How would you save changes to that?
[353:48.98]Go for it.
[353:50.38]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.
[354:02.85]Okay.
[354:03.11]In the middle.
[354:23.81]62%, 49, 40%, 49%, okay.
[354:25.59]Is chat getting too caught up drawing a dick on the screen that I'm just gonna win in four moves?
[355:02.99]You can't just click... No mercy.
[355:18.56]Okay.
[355:28.87]Good luck.
[355:33.52]Are you going to draw your dick to victory?
[355:35.36]Is that what this is?
[355:39.35]That's not even... I don't think that's possible.
[356:12.17]Right here?
[356:12.47]47?
[356:12.49]46, okay.
[356:13.21]Yeah, that works for me.
[356:20.13]No, that's good.
[356:20.99]Good call.
[356:33.09]No, that's not rigged.
[356:34.19]That's not rigged.
[356:35.41]I was in the middle of saying that's good for me and all of a sudden everybody changes their votes.
[356:43.31]It was 44 to 39.
[356:44.51]And I was like, alright.
[356:46.25]And then it was like, wait, no, hold on.
[356:47.43]And everybody clicked on over here.
[356:48.63]It didn't wait long enough.
[356:57.02]I waited plenty.
[356:57.96]That was as long as I waited the last 10 turns.
[357:10.44]What?
[357:12.38]Pull it back.
[357:13.14]Let's run it back.
[357:13.99]Let's see it.
[357:21.73]Well, yeah, but you just wanted to win.
[357:23.91]No, it's not the case.
[357:27.09]But let's pick another game because we got to move through this shit.
[357:32.67]That one isn't canon, okay?
[357:33.95]We'll count the first one as canon.
[357:35.31]We tied.
[357:35.83]It was a tie game between the two of us.
[357:39.06]Between the 1 in 4,500 of us.
[357:44.66]What the hell was that game called?
[357:47.61]Checkers?
[357:51.29]Connect Four?
[357:55.02]I have no idea what the hell that was.
[357:58.94]Four Up.
[357:59.92]Right over here, right?
[358:00.74]Right there.
[358:01.08]Alright, where are we going?
[358:13.89]Oh, why is everyone spam-linking this?
[358:16.69]It makes it so... Honest to God.
[358:26.92]It makes it so bad.
[358:29.84]Because... We need to watch this, because this is very important.
[358:33.22]The slap in the game makes this fucking so brutal.
[358:38.81]Do you understand?
[358:43.14]the slap in the game.
[358:45.92]I timed it perfectly.
[358:54.16]Why am I linking this?
[358:55.62]You've already seen it.
[358:59.72]That is... Oh my... Yeah, it was real.
[359:04.20]I accidentally did it, but the game sound made that so much worse.
[359:11.67]That wasn't as loud as that actually was.
[359:14.99]That looks like I fucking crushed myself.
[359:16.99]Alright, where we going?
[359:27.34]Did it hurt?
[359:28.08]No, because I didn't... I'm not playing.
[359:32.69]Connect up again.
[359:49.31]I'm not, no.
[359:52.87]Let's, okay, the clip of me cheating.
[359:56.77]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[359:57.75]I want to get this on stream so we can have a documented evidence of it happening.
[360:02.89]Documented proof.
[360:08.60]One sec.
[360:14.74]We can watch this right now.
[360:18.97]Yeah, that works for me.
[360:20.99]No, that's good.

[360:28.26]Take a look again.
[360:30.96]Slow it down.
[360:31.44]No, that's good.
[360:33.84]Good call.
[360:35.20]Look at this.
[360:38.38]43 to 39.

[360:52.89]Are you listening?
[360:56.33]See?

[361:06.08]There was not a consensus.

[362:18.38]It's been six hours.
[362:19.44]Alright.
[362:24.24]If even one percent click on something else, I'm going to count it.
[362:30.12]You understand?
[362:39.00]That's unbelievable.
[362:40.82]Okay, I'm going to grab another soda.
[362:45.38]Someone's going to click.
[362:46.12]I know they will.

[363:13.19]Alright, I really am going to grab another drink.
[363:14.81]I'll be right back.
[363:16.11]Probably the last break of the night.
[363:18.29]And we will clock out the rest of these.
[363:21.87]Probably another couple hours, maybe.
[363:23.59]Maybe like an hour, hour or two.
[363:24.65]Who knows?
[363:25.89]We're just going to go.

[363:40.34]No, you cheater.
[363:43.26]I'll be right back.
[363:54.13]You think I'm going to leave without turning that off?
[363:57.93]This is the chat that cried wolf.
[363:59.39]I'll be right back.
[367:01.51]So I just tried to explain to the people downstairs that I hit myself, that I slapped myself in the face.
[367:10.03]And I just got, they couldn't even understand how it was possible.
[367:19.33]Was I going on purpose?
[367:20.29]No, no, no.
[367:21.69]Were you drinking?
[367:22.21]No, I wasn't drinking.
[367:24.85]It ain't easy being green.
[367:28.73]As Kermit the fucking frog once said.
[367:35.40]Alright.
[367:36.93]So what have we decided to do?
[367:38.93]Chat.

[368:34.02]Why am I talking?
[368:35.56]Stop talking!
[368:48.44]This never would have happened if we didn't have to come back into this game.
[368:55.84]Vote.
[368:56.17]I'll take that vote.
[368:57.21]Kick me.
[368:57.55]Get me out of here.
[369:01.67]I'm going to give a lot of time for you guys.
[369:16.50]More than 10 seconds.
[369:17.50]It was like 25 seconds.
[369:22.22]You can't tell me that it wasn't.
[369:23.59]Where are you off to?
[369:39.46]I'm going to hold on for like 10 seconds.
[369:40.52]10 seconds.
[369:49.32]Okay, that's pretty, that's unanimous.
[370:04.78]Do a bad impression and the vote kicks increase.
[370:15.12]Look at how torn this chat is now.
[370:18.13]You can't blame it on time this time, guys.
[370:21.97]You gotta blame it on... The... The 20... Blame falls here.

[371:45.53]This is horrible.
[371:55.25]Slap yourself.

[372:30.18]Okay.
[372:39.34]Can't go this way.
[372:42.78]Can't really go that way.
[372:46.26]So I guess I'm going to go this way.
[372:51.43]You're fucked now.
[372:53.59]LOL.
[373:03.08]Go for the bottom.

[374:53.09]What do you mean a recount?
[374:54.33]I don't get a recount.
[374:58.55]Let's refresh it.
[374:59.84]Fine.
[375:00.66]You get your one phone a friend here.
[375:06.08]What are you guys doing?
[375:08.54]Why is it so?
[375:09.50]What is the consensus here?

[375:15.12]think this is 40 40. this is 41 41 I don't know what this is that it's it's right here
[375:44.77]No, yeah, it's definitely this one.

[380:34.09]I'm gonna give you the time to figure it out.
[380:40.89]I am gonna put my hands up.
[380:49.73]That's 10 seconds.
[380:53.85]That's it.
[380:55.43]I can't let you guys think about it that much.
[380:58.47]That's it.
[380:59.51]That's 10%.

[382:26.34]Are you done now?
[382:28.66]Can we move on?
[382:39.76]Why would I do that again?
[382:41.25]We already did it.
[382:42.85]I'm going to pick one at random.
[382:49.63]Play the Vincent Price left for us.
[382:51.43]No.
[382:59.31]Will you pick something?
[383:00.71]We've been here for six and a half hours, guys.
[383:03.91]Pick something else.
[383:08.21]There's not much more.
[383:09.02]There's only like 15 more video games to try.
[383:11.14]I'm gonna do it again.
[383:21.78]No.
[383:22.66]I wanna win.
[383:23.10]Well, that's too bad.
[383:26.65]We're gonna play the Cat in the Maze.
[383:31.36]Good choice.
[383:31.70]See, there you go.
[383:32.38]You guys get to have your win.

[383:36.00]First of all, beat you guys the first time we played Checkers.
[383:41.41]Beat you guys in chess.
[383:42.21]Checkmated you guys in about three seconds.
[383:46.77]We're tied right now.
[383:50.03]Checkers rematch.
[383:50.83]No, no, no.
[383:51.43]Why would I do that?
[383:52.18]You win, you go out.
[383:55.32]Alright, so we're going to do Catmaze.
[383:59.92]What the hell is this thing called?
[384:02.54]Aqua Boat Maze.

[385:23.29]I don't know.
[385:41.98]Duh!
[385:42.46]A lot of information.
[385:43.26]Anchor slows monster down.
[385:44.54]Extra life.
[385:45.00]Gives you temporary invulnerability.
[385:46.39]You can eat monsters with the ring buoy.
[385:49.11]Collect the dots.
[385:50.93]This is just Pac-Man.
[385:52.89]Yes, it is.
[385:53.27]And there's a Lego guy here.
[386:00.09]All you guys that wanted me to play Lego Island, well... This is kind of it, isn't it?
[386:12.48]There's no island.

[387:40.41]That one's done?
[387:44.11]No one wants me to sit there and play that for another five minutes.
[387:46.49]I don't think one person does.
[387:49.59]One person.
[388:13.32]You're right.
[388:13.58]There is always one guy.
[388:14.56]That's true.
[388:18.31]Well, the 35% on connect up is being deleted.
[388:22.01]So we're going to go with the next highest one.
[388:23.89]It is books and beaks in space.
[388:27.07]Books lost in space.
[388:32.66]Where is it?
[388:34.84]Break ball lost in space.
[388:43.92]No, I'm not gonna play Checkers for an hour and a half with chat.
[388:48.44]We've got 700,000 games to get through.
[388:50.96]This one's gonna be the disaster.
[388:59.28]I can't see it and there's no options.
[389:05.00]I'm gonna do this one really quick.
[389:06.52]This one, here we go.
[389:07.24]Okay, cool.
[389:11.42]Exactly.
[389:32.88]What do I get?
[389:34.04]What do I get?
[390:22.31]Can you guys see what's going on?
[390:46.56]I think we hard pass the ones that cannot be opened correctly.
[390:53.55]You know what I'm saying?
[391:19.23]40% of these.
[391:19.92]Yeah, guess what?
[391:35.01]40% of your votes aren't counted.
[391:38.25]Because of this.
[391:45.73]Bowling.
[391:46.93]I know it says bowling.
[391:47.86]Bowling.
[391:49.06]Cosmo Ali Bowling.
[391:50.34]Let's hope this one works.
[391:53.66]Undemocratic.
[391:55.90]Well, come on.
[391:59.40]Cosmo Ali Bowling.
[392:02.81]I played this one.
[392:05.35]Did it open on your computer?
[392:06.97]That's a start.
[392:50.94]Run as admin?
[392:53.22]I did.
[392:53.58]I've done it on a bunch of them already.
[392:56.45]I'll try this one.
[392:58.59]This whole thing right now is open in Windows 7 compatibility, which it's supposed to be, and in administrator mode.
[393:05.45]I've tried to open them from their own respective folders in administrative mode, and it doesn't do anything.
[393:09.61]I will try this one more time, see if we can get it to work.
[393:14.84]It's just a whole lot of bullshit, if you ask me.
[393:21.20]That one was called Cosmo Alley Bowling.
[393:28.82]There it is.
[393:30.52]Properties.
[393:31.00]We got to make sure it is compatible.
[393:33.36]Compatibility.
[393:34.14]Yes.
[393:35.36]And it's as administrator.
[393:37.64]Try it again.
[393:38.26]It's as it is, right?
[393:40.97]Okay.
[393:44.19]Come on.
[393:48.69]Jerma sounds fed up.
[393:52.99]I just can't believe they released a second one of these.
[393:56.53]And it didn't work.
[394:05.25]The arrogance on releasing a second one.
[394:11.88]The insolence, the arrogance of doing a version two.
[394:23.53]You don't know how scams work.
[394:33.14]Hold on.
[394:35.62]What company is this?
[394:38.61]What else have they done?
[394:40.41]This is Viva Media.
[394:58.75]Wild tangent what no, it's not What have they made where have I heard this name before
[395:27.23]I swear to God I've heard this name somewhere.
[395:34.31]Oh my God.
[395:37.19]Stalker.
[395:46.99]Are you kidding me?
[395:48.66]I knew I heard this name of this company before.
[395:51.36]No way.
[395:53.92]Who made it?
[395:57.04]No, that's not the same company that's gsc game world Why would viva media be connected to stalker What Viva media games take a look what pops up in the first thing
[396:25.18]Strange.
[396:25.70]Maybe there's like a weird keyword in there.
[396:31.46]It's a publisher.
[396:34.07]Oh, the conspiracy deepens.
[396:35.93]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[396:45.37]No, no, no, no.
[396:46.14]Don't do that.
[396:50.28]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[396:52.64]No, I'm not going to condone that kind of... I'm not going to condone that kind of behavior.
[396:59.71]Mm-mm.
[397:01.09]Nope.
[397:02.25]I'm not even going to say it because I don't even want to give it attention.
[397:04.27]I don't want to condone that behavior.
[397:06.47]So I'm not going to give it attention.
[397:08.79]Nope.
[397:09.33]No.
[397:10.09]No.
[397:10.51]Pick the next game.
[397:19.86]Wait, what is this coffee pasta here?
[397:22.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[397:23.63]I need to fucking, I need to, I gotta paste this on the screen.
[397:26.28]Because I, hold on, that went by too fast.
[397:58.48]Users have complained that the company's products have an adverse effect on their PC's performance or are intrusive to the user's experience.
[398:05.31]PC Magazine wrote in 2004 that although the program is not very evil, some privacy complaints were justified as the program's user manual states that it may collect name, address, phone number, email, and other contact information and could distribute the collected information with the user's consent.
[398:32.55]Where did you get this from?
[398:34.79]Did one guy make this up?
[398:36.65]I think one guy may have made this up.
[398:39.65]No.
[398:40.39]Did one guy make this fucking story up?
[398:48.42]And I gave it Administrator.
[399:12.69]You know what I think is a great title?
[399:14.85]I think it's a fun series of games.
[399:20.09]700,000 games is a fun thing.
[399:22.47]It's fun.
[399:22.95]I think I... I just want to make sure that... Oh, my God.
[399:28.41]There's no... What do I... Okay, time to play fucking... Oh, well, we're in too deep already.
[399:33.74]Let's fucking keep going.
[399:48.28]Somebody wrote, it's not fun.
[399:50.00]Why bother?
[399:52.94]But that may have just been a jokey copypasta.
[399:56.24]I don't want to like say that that's, I just want to make sure we're clear.
[399:59.70]That could just be like a gotcha streamer moment and whatever.
[400:03.06]I'm going to just say it is because I don't want to fucking think that that happened.
[400:25.41]I'm never going to be able to look at this and not go, oh my God.
[400:30.06]No, but this isn't Wild Tangent though.
[400:31.64]The company name was just listed there.
[400:40.59]I'm not going to fucking play Connect Four again.
[400:44.47]Okay?
[400:44.99]You have to pick something out.
[400:48.59]That's a Wild Tangent Wikipedia.
[400:50.47]That's not even the same company.
[401:02.99]Can one person click something else?
[401:14.35]They know your garage door password.
[401:22.08]Is nobody clicking?
[401:26.80]Is my click fucked up?
[401:39.93]I just almost threw up because of this.
[401:41.42]I just saw 100% again.
[401:49.06]We have to refresh it because that's not going to work.
[402:03.57]What are you guys doing?

[412:31.68]And drag this down here.

[412:40.05]I would assume.
[412:40.65]Something like that.
[412:42.27]Give it a try.

[415:01.19]Place your bet on red and black, high, low.
[415:03.40]If you win, your bet will be multiplied by two.
[415:06.07]When the outcome is zero, your bet will be multiplied by 13.

[415:48.75]GG.
[415:52.63]Alright guys, we're at the point of the stream where I'm gonna start just fucking opening.
[416:01.49]Maybe one or two more picks and then I'm just gonna blow through them.
[416:04.35]And we're gonna try to find a good one.
[416:10.66]What happened?
[416:13.02]What's the little Kirby fucker in the left?
[416:16.54]I'm getting tired.
[416:17.14]Alright, looks like we're doing Kirby.
[416:31.11]This is called... Lil Herder.
[416:40.75]It's called head trauma.
[416:52.18]This is full screen, but is it actually full screen?
[416:56.12]We'll find out in a minute.
[417:02.59]It's possible we win.

[418:18.96]Very poorly.

[428:22.69]Here it comes.
[428:36.74]Someone took a screenshot of the ghosts.
[428:39.60]What ghosts?
[428:47.53]Ghosts?
[428:54.15]What the hell did I just do?
[428:54.97]I have no idea.
[428:59.95]Oh, this is the one with the music.
[429:02.45]I remember this one.
[429:03.07]Oh, great.

[430:09.53]I forgot about this.
[430:38.82]The same exact thing happened in the video.
[430:42.96]Remember this one?
[430:43.54]I did a James Bond reference here, right?
[430:47.22]References!

[431:38.67]Community made workshop maps?
[431:40.69]That was very deceiving.
[431:41.63]I thought that was a jump, but they forgot to put the gray part in.
[431:48.96]That's not a checkpoint.
[431:54.30]Where's the checkpoint then?
[432:05.84]That's not a checkpoint either.
[432:08.13]None of these are checkpoints.
[432:10.68]Why is this called Bullet?
[432:33.41]Game crashed.
[432:34.85]It did not do the loop.
[432:40.35]I definitely did not play this in the video, did I?
[432:42.31]I didn't even know how to change courses.
[432:50.98]I'm not sure I even attempted.
[433:03.31]Why was it that loud?
[433:09.57]Cool.
[433:43.99]Alright, those two.
[433:45.75]Am I gonna be able to get through these tonight?
[433:48.55]I'm not sure I'm gonna.
[433:53.27]What's left?
[433:56.68]The ghost in the closet.
[434:00.16]Is it time to go to bed?
[434:01.78]It might be time to end this.
[434:10.56]It's been like over seven and a half hours.
[434:13.17]Of...
[434:14.61]One of the fucking worst things ever.
[434:17.65]Do teapot... Alright, we're gonna do... Here's what we're gonna do.
[434:21.49]We're gonna do... Oh my god.
[434:28.28]I did not think this was gonna be this long.
[434:30.78]We spent way too much time on checkers.
[434:36.98]Let's go over what these are gonna be.
[434:39.02]And we'll play the ones that are worth playing.
[434:41.09]Okay?
[434:45.92]Let me see here.
[434:46.56]So we've got Star Cosmic Bustout.
[434:49.70]Uh, yeah.
[434:52.30]No.
[434:52.82]That's going to be a Breakout clone.
[434:55.60]Star Cosmic Invaders.
[434:57.68]Uh, yeah.
[434:58.44]That's a Breakout clone.
[435:03.79]Seek and Find Collection 2.
[435:10.79]Hey, how about that?
[435:11.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[435:11.81]I'm going to mark...
[435:30.64]We're going straight through.
[435:49.19]Part two tomorrow.
[435:50.55]No, we can't do a part two.
[435:53.43]Part two is only going to be like an hour and 10 minutes.
[436:08.99]Part two plus Kenshi.
[436:11.96]No, we can do it.
[436:13.44]It's only, what time is it?
[436:14.28]11, 12, 1, 2.
[436:16.56]It's 2 a.m.
[436:17.22]Eastern.
[436:17.56]That's fucking late as hell.
[436:21.76]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[436:31.07]This is the plan, okay?
[436:39.98]Tomorrow, we are going to do the remaining games.
[436:49.41]And, and, and, and, because it's only going to probably take like an hour or two, I've wanted to play Lucius 3 for quite a long time.
[437:12.49]so we're gonna do we're gonna do this tomorrow and probably lucius three as well they made a two yeah they made a three it really flew under the radar like crazy
[437:38.28]But it is getting really late.
[437:40.18]I really thought we were going to blow through this.
[437:42.82]But we put a lot of time into checkers.
[437:45.94]So... It's time for bed.
[437:54.45]Actual end of the stream voice.
[437:55.63]We'll do it tomorrow.
[437:57.53]And then we will... Depending on... I mean, it depends on how long that takes.
[438:00.97]I don't think we'll take that long.
[438:01.83]Look at all these X's.
[438:04.94]We really only have... Probably have like another two... Maybe two and a half hours.
[438:11.68]Take those X's off.
[438:12.76]Yeah, you know, I need to take a... Like, somebody screen cap this shit.
[438:20.10]There we go.
[438:24.94]Though we have quite a few decent ones to go through tomorrow.
[438:35.19]He plays one game for 11 hours, can't play 700,000 for 7 hours.
[438:41.07]Yeah, but that was one.
[438:43.21]I feel like my brain is overstimulated.
[438:52.10]So we'll pick back up tomorrow.
[438:54.38]The way we left off here.
[438:55.88]Still gonna do the bits?
[439:02.51]One game.
[439:06.57]Yeah, let me just pee and we'll come back and do the bits.
[439:14.04]Does it feel wrong leaving the stream half done?
[439:16.16]We are way more than half done.
[439:17.86]We're like 70% done.
[439:22.67]There will always be a part two.
[439:24.15]Don't worry.
[439:25.95]I'll see you tomorrow for this part two.
[439:28.33]Lucius three.
[439:29.67]Depends on how quickly we go through these.
[439:37.49]And I'm going to go pee.
[439:38.41]I'll be right back.
[439:40.33]See you guys in a second.
[441:47.75]Did you guys see the ghost?
[441:50.79]Holy, what the heck?
[441:58.95]So, probably like 3, 3.30 tomorrow.
[442:03.16]We'll get back into it.
[442:05.30]But for now, let's go back a ways.
[442:12.08]Thank you, Binary Man, for the $6.
[442:13.17]Appreciate it.
[442:16.65]This is... Watch the whole thing for the full experience.
[442:21.09]This file has been scanned with the binary anti-gnome system.
[442:25.23]Zero gnomes have been detected.

[442:54.33]Be brave.
[442:56.03]I can't fucking believe it.
[442:58.09]I thought that guy was gone forever.
[443:07.02]Never have I ever experienced something like that.
[443:11.02]Where...
[443:14.46]One video, there's an audio file and a voice actor that's there.
[443:18.72]And the next video, he's gone.
[443:24.12]Here's the link.
[443:30.88]They replaced him with a bunch of other random shit.
[443:34.02]But thank you, Binary Man.
[443:35.76]For 12 total dollars is another message here.
[443:40.31]Anti-gnome scan, there's zero gnomes here.

[445:07.41]Well, we got to watch that after.
[445:08.59]We got to watch that because I got to see how many... I got to make sure I get all the references correct.
[445:13.98]So we need to make sure we got to go... After I'm done, we're going to go back and see how many references were made.
[445:19.64]But thank you, Jay Paul.
[445:26.18]Thank you.
[445:26.52]Bake me home for the $2.
[445:27.22]They say money.
[445:28.22]Thank you.
[445:29.93]Moe's Cow, or Moo's Cow, thanks for the $15.
[445:32.69]Oh, is Nova streaming?
[445:45.20]Oh, yeah, he is.
[445:47.54]Well, when we get done with the bits, we'll go say hello.
[445:51.79]What's he playing?
[445:58.26]Super Mario Deluxe is... Sounds interesting.
[446:05.31]You could have finished the games if you ignored the bits.
[446:09.35]No, but I'm... I am, like, faded right now.
[446:13.33]I'd rather attack this tomorrow and be able to have some more energy and have fun.
[446:17.81]Because, like, I was just, like... That last two games was just... I was in the back of my chair, slumped over.
[446:33.17]So, don't worry.
[446:36.03]It's like not even 12, 24 hours from now.
[446:42.09]But thank you for the $15, Musco.
[446:45.84]Hey, Germanists, we'd like to say that the new year starts.
[446:48.82]That we all really appreciate the effort and dedication to streaming that you put in.
[446:52.44]And over the six years I've been watching your videos and some streams, it really has been able to uplift me through some tough times.
[446:59.38]And I would just like to say thanks.
[447:03.41]Absolutely.
[447:03.83]Thank you.
[447:05.69]Thank you so much.
[447:08.43]New Year.
[447:08.83]We're going to have a lot of fun.
[447:13.54]Thank you so much.
[447:15.24]Moose Cow.
[447:16.42]For the $15.
[447:21.38]Super Seal.
[447:22.28]I wonder if this Chad streamer will read my message if I donate 50 bits twice.
[447:27.04]I mean, you did do it right in a row.
[447:29.70]So, you did send a dollar within like 10 seconds.
[447:36.43]So, the first one didn't have a message.
[447:39.31]I'll count it.
[447:41.35]I'll count it.
[447:44.51]Thank you, The Milkman, for the $1 God Tear Frog Trigger Finger.
[447:51.10]That was doing some pretty good spamming.
[447:53.71]Thank you, OneRigi, for the one dollar.
[447:56.37]They just put a heart there, thank you.
[447:58.92]Spreeo, thanks for the one dollar.
[448:00.30]Hey, Jerma, I would love to suggest you a game you might enjoy playing and chilling around with.
[448:05.86]It's called Sam & Max, Save the World.
[448:11.63]It's a comedy point and click.
[448:13.79]It's very charmful and funny, with dialogue and puzzles.
[448:16.83]It's kind of hard to solve, but you'll enjoy solving them.
[448:20.15]Game is a bit slow to start.
[448:21.88]It's well worth getting deep into it.
[448:24.06]Oh, it also has rats.
[448:26.34]Yeah.
[448:28.38]Uh, Sam & Max has been recommended and talked about before.
[448:35.92]Maybe on one of these days where I'm just kind of hanging out.
[448:38.44]Probably fun.
[448:40.83]Dark Star, thanks for the $5.
[448:41.93]Oh, sorry.
[448:42.39]Dark Star, 700,000 games.
[448:47.51]Of all the days you could have picked for the sequel to one of my favorite videos you've ever made, you chose my birthday.
[448:54.04]Man, you really are such a gift, and maybe I'll sound like an obsessive fan when I say this, but you're seriously one of my favorite people on God's green Earth.
[449:03.36]Keep doing funny shit, my dude.
[449:06.04]And your name is very relevant today.
[449:10.42]Thank you for the $5, and thanks for the incredibly kind words.
[449:15.54]Happy birthday.
[449:17.65]Dark Star 700,000 games.
[449:23.41]My favorite part about this is the... Is the ultimate bait.
[449:30.96]Because this is just the same pack.
[449:36.96]I'm reliving this shit again.
[449:43.73]But it is fun.
[449:44.85]It's always fun.
[449:47.22]Thank you, Flank Tank, for the $1.
[449:48.56]Hey, Jeremiah, given the last of my bits before I buy more, was watching Incredibles 2 the other day.
[449:53.16]And I gotta say, this was my favorite scene.
[449:58.06]This platter doesn't look all that happy to me.
[450:00.96]It looks bored.
[450:02.66]Ha!
[450:03.21]The bored platter!
[450:04.99]I thought VI would want to change a pace from driving.
[450:07.73]Is this a spoiler?
[450:11.27]Is this gonna be like a... Am I gonna, like, play a spoiler on screen?
[450:16.90]No.
[450:17.56]Okay.
[450:18.72]I like drive-in food.
[450:20.66]Does this mean vegetables?
[450:22.42]A balanced diet means vegetables, kiddo.
[450:24.94]Get used to it.
[450:26.98]Good evening, everyone.
[450:34.04]Thank you, uh, Swiggity Swanky for the $1.
[450:36.31]You wonder why I don't show videos on stream.
[450:39.29]On the camera, unless I know what they are.
[450:44.74]Thank you, Flank Tank.
[450:45.46]Thank you, Swiggity Swanky for the $1.
[450:47.62]Here it is.
[450:48.44]Here's what.
[450:57.55]One right after the other, really?
[451:00.15]You working together?
[451:02.55]See the logical thanks for the $1.
[451:04.51]They say Kappa.
[451:06.37]Kappa.
[451:08.53]Avon Grad, thanks for the $1 streamer.
[451:10.23]So good at 700,000 games.
[451:12.77]He... integrer overflows and becomes bad at every single one.
[451:26.74]What?
[451:34.09]GG, idiot.
[451:38.81]What word is that?
[451:40.67]Am I saying that word wrong?
[451:42.73]Thank you P337R for the $5.
[451:45.07]Hey, J-E-R-M-A.
[451:47.77]Thanks a lot, P337R.
[451:56.36]Thank you Cetalogical again for the $1.
[451:58.40]Pogchamp, thank you.
[452:00.12]It's time for slime.
[452:00.78]Thanks for the $3.
[452:01.84]Is this the song?
[452:03.76]Is this the song?
[452:12.90]No, I don't think so.
[452:16.08]Maybe it is.
[452:17.24]It might be.
[452:20.00]Drop that song link.
[452:22.30]There you go.
[452:43.29]By the way, there's a gnome in there.
[452:46.43]Thank you, it's time for slime.
[452:47.43]I'm not sure if that's what I was thinking of, but it might be.
[452:51.19]Thank you, Concerto, for the five dollars.
[452:54.37]Hey, Jerma, you might be thinking of the mob song from Beauty and the Beast.
[452:58.21]Also, the original 700,000 games is one of my favorite videos of yours.
[453:01.66]So I'm super happy you're doing this.
[453:02.92]Thank you.
[453:08.35]I don't know anything else in that whole song.
[453:11.61]I don't think that's it though.
[453:42.63]Alec, thanks for the $1 Alec 4x4.
[453:45.19]Hey, cool guy, what kind of Timberland Yeezy Supreme Gucci Jordan AirPods you got?
[453:51.04]If you're rich enough to afford 700,000 games, you have to have all the brands on one product.
[454:01.00]Where was this during drunk karaoke night?
[454:04.42]Drunk karaoke night?
[454:10.28]When was I drunk doing karaoke?
[454:14.80]I have Bose One Earphone.
[454:19.80]Thank you, though, Alec.
[454:20.40]Thank you, C4G, for the $3.
[454:21.84]How can one streamer afford so many games?
[454:23.73]Because they're in a big package.
[454:28.13]And they come in one disc.
[454:32.41]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[454:33.73]I got no words.
[454:39.28]Bug Frenzy.
[454:41.22]Windows Game 2004.
[454:42.32]And it says it's Minecraft.
[454:47.04]Is it because of the textures?
[454:48.82]That's kind of what like cobblestone looks like.
[454:50.58]Is it like pulling the cobblestone algorithm?
[454:54.51]Might be.
[454:56.51]FGWGWF, thanks for the $30.
[454:58.13]Thank you.
[455:03.73]So I guess Twitch isn't going to refund my bits, so I might as well give them to you.
[455:08.40]You've been a huge comedic inspiration to me.
[455:10.90]And since I started watching back in 2011, you've given me nothing but laughs all these years.
[455:14.82]Thanks for being yourself no matter what.
[455:17.67]It's all I can be.
[455:20.37]I really appreciate that.
[455:21.27]I'm really sorry that you can't... Twitch had a bug that had you buy a shitload of bits.
[455:30.57]But I am humbled that you would want to give them all to me.
[455:33.42]So, thank you.
[455:37.48]So much.
[455:40.22]And I'm honored to be an inspiration.
[455:42.38]Thank you.
[455:45.06]Bezos isn't sorry.
[455:48.17]Hans Beetz, thanks for the two bucks.
[455:49.61]Yo, Jumbo Dumbo, have you ever considered playing the original Fable from 2004?
[455:53.27]One of the best games ever.
[455:57.01]I do enjoy that game.
[455:58.05]I think it's very good.
[455:58.71]I've played through it probably twice.
[456:01.37]I played the remastered one.
[456:03.81]And the original one.
[456:05.22]And the Lost Tales, whatever the hell it was.
[456:07.30]The Lost Levels.
[456:09.46]It's a great game.
[456:12.40]Maybe not on stream, though.
[456:14.76]It's great.
[456:16.50]Jumbo Dumbo.
[456:18.68]Banana and Bananurism.
[456:21.21]Thanks for the $1.
[456:23.25]I've been super sick the past few days.
[456:24.63]The stream has been doing a really good job of cheering me up.
[456:27.49]Hope you feel better.
[456:29.69]And thank you for the $1.
[456:32.17]Get well.
[456:33.12]Get well soon.
[456:37.18]Thank you to Darkstar700000games again for $1.
[456:41.76]jermaOld, Jerma one guy.
[456:43.10]We got new emotes.
[456:44.92]This is the best day ever.
[456:48.49]Yeah, there's new emotes.
[456:54.71]Well, one of them has been here already.
[456:56.67]But I made it a baseline emote.
[457:00.77]Expensive will be changing to something else.
[457:03.73]Something more appropriate.
[457:11.43]Didn't I learn my lesson the last time?
[457:14.82]That I played this game?
[457:15.94]Yeah.
[457:17.83]But I thought we were going to get all new lessons.
[457:23.01]I guess the one good thing about this is you guys can see in real time.
[457:26.41]This is kind of a behind the scenes video.
[457:29.19]Three years later.
[457:31.49]Because even though I got baited into thinking this was the second one.
[457:37.52]You guys get to see in real time how fucking ridiculous and horrible this is.
[457:41.82]So.
[457:44.62]Live behind the scenes three years later video.
[457:48.97]It's called Version 2, not 700,000 Games 2.
[457:52.39]Well, Version 2... Why would they need to release a whole nother product if not to put different shit in it?
[458:09.13]For money.
[458:09.61]700,000 Games exists.
[458:13.36]700,000 Games Version 2.
[458:18.54]You gotta assume that there has to be a reason for that version to exist.
[458:27.62]Don't want to seem mean, but it's kind of sad to think about past Jerma playing these alone and talking to himself.
[458:36.82]I mean, you're describing almost every video I've probably ever made.
[458:46.47]That's like making a video.
[458:54.38]But, yeah.
[458:57.71]Thank you to... Again, Bala Koala.
[459:03.99]Just that guy.
[459:04.81]You guys gave a shitload of money.
[459:09.04]Thank you, both of you.
[459:10.96]Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[459:12.30]Well, if it's for another game, here's your money, greedy streamer.
[459:18.78]What do you mean, greedy streamer?
[459:22.90]What did I do?
[459:23.26]Sad.
[459:24.40]You should be happy.
[459:25.12]It was a fun time.
[459:54.27]I hope my donation is on soon.
[459:55.63]I have to pee so bad.
[460:03.66]Let me tell you, I don't see it for a little while.
[460:07.36]But thank you, Flugboy.
[460:08.14]Don't be sad.
[460:08.66]That was a great experience.
[460:11.46]I had a lot of fun.
[460:12.08]I always have fun when I do meet and greets.
[460:18.67]Stop so he can pee.
[460:21.31]Did just that guy give another $20?
[460:23.73]How do I join?
[460:24.47]And don't question my choices on getting your attention.
[460:26.63]How do you vote?
[460:27.35]I think we may have... Hopefully... You have to install the extension, maybe, or refresh the page.
[460:35.73]Hopefully you got it.
[460:38.41]Thank you, just that guy, for the huge amount of money.
[460:43.85]Uh, numble or no, no, it's numb legs, not numble.
[460:49.10]Thanks for the $10.02.
[460:49.98]Love you, Jeremy.
[460:51.74]Thank you.
[460:53.64]Stop so I can pee, please.
[460:56.56]Alright, go, go, go now.
[460:58.98]Right now.
[461:09.10]Quick, read his message.
[461:10.00]No, he can pee.
[461:10.56]Come right back.
[461:14.57]Just That Guy gave another $40.
[461:20.18]This is all part of Just That Guy's spree of a shitload of money.
[461:28.77]So, thank you, Just That Guy.
[461:30.13]$40, $50, $50, $60.
[461:30.21]You've given an extreme amount.
[461:39.33]And they say, cool witch will burn down your village and will still be styling while doing it.
[461:46.86]I can't fucking believe you guys found that so quickly.
[461:54.06]Thank you so much, just that guy.
[461:55.42]You back?
[461:57.87]Did you pee?
[461:58.31]You back?
[462:06.33]Alright, welcome back.
[462:08.34]Which emote?
[462:08.58]Well, let me... I need to see the legality of that.
[462:09.96]But thank you for the $7.
[462:10.52]It's time for slime.
[462:11.00]Gave the $50 earlier.
[462:11.62]Showing the witch.
[462:36.28]For Liddy, we got you earlier too.
[462:38.68]50 fucking dollars.
[462:39.70]Thank you guys.
[462:40.26]You guys are unbelievable.
[462:45.15]Uh, thank you Scribble for the one dollar.
[462:46.67]This is the hardest I've laughed in a while.
[462:48.21]Thanks, Jerma.
[462:52.29]The surfing witch.
[462:54.79]Yeah, and that was... That was ridiculous.
[462:57.35]Great Canadian fuck club.
[463:00.65]Gave 10 community subs.
[463:01.73]I think I missed it.
[463:02.81]Ampharic gave 5.
[463:03.92]Thank you, both of you.
[463:06.20]Solid milk.
[463:06.76]Thanks for $1.
[463:07.70]Great stream, Jerma.
[463:08.42]I just got a Fireman shirt today and your stream is giving me something to look forward to.
[463:12.99]Fireman is one of the best characters ever created, so... Don't blame you.
[463:23.19]It's the spy theme from TF2.
[463:25.20]What is the spy theme?
[463:26.50]What are you talking about?
[463:38.14]I think it actually is.
[463:50.59]Well, it was obvious.
[463:52.65]He's the red spy.
[463:55.97]Kill me.
[463:58.19]Yeah, you got it, I think.
[464:04.65]Thank you, Solid Bill.
[464:05.45]Thank you, Clockwork, for the $1.
[464:07.29]Jerma, our favorite gnome has a song for you.
[464:09.73]I paid real money for you to listen to this.
[464:13.25]So, please listen.
[464:14.65]This is the guy's website.
[464:17.86]I'm not clicking on this.
[464:21.86]This is just clicking on a gnome.
[464:25.06]And knowing that I'm clicking on it.
[464:26.28]Just pretend I did.
[464:29.00]I paid money for that.
[464:31.87]He paid real money to have me get gnomed.
[464:37.87]Yeah, I'll do it for you.
[464:41.67]Look.
[464:43.01]Let me click it.
[464:43.55]Alright, here it is.
[464:50.62]Clicked it.
[464:53.74]Shit.
[464:54.28]He got me.
[465:08.48]You stopped the stream for me to pee.
[465:12.05]Now you have to listen to the song.
[465:14.89]Well, you only get to be the one guy.
[465:16.61]At least once.
[465:22.81]No, I mean you only get to be the one guy once.
[465:28.77]You might not be the one guy again.
[465:30.93]Doesn't mean it won't happen.
[465:34.63]I stopped the stream.
[465:37.26]for you to go to the bathroom as the one guy you clocked in your one guy ticket there now you could another day you could like tomorrow the next day but you can't you're gonna you can only exchange one guy ticket once per day or maybe once a week not a gnome
[466:06.65]Do I learn anything?
[466:09.55]Thank you, Clockwork Dole.
[466:10.61]Hope you had a good bathroom break.
[466:12.87]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber for the $1.
[466:14.21]You'll never find the witch image.
[466:15.33]Can't you see?
[466:16.67]It was the two images edited together.
[466:18.45]Chat has failed.
[466:21.71]There really might be those two edited together to fuck with infringement.
[466:26.53]Hey, C. Clampus, thanks for the $10.
[466:28.25]Tell Andre I say hi.
[466:29.31]Uh...
[466:37.72]I don't... Who's... What do you mean Andre?
[466:46.06]Andre.
[466:46.44]Alright, well, hi.
[466:49.11]Hi.
[466:54.19]Jess Homeboy, thanks for the $1.
[466:56.23]You say, how do they have the balls to be so lazy?
[466:58.85]But it's because people like you give them $11 for these half-broken Flash games.
[467:04.83]But...
[467:07.02]no one else is buying this there's not there can't be that many people that purchase this game they probably make like three or four hundred dollars a year on these games thousands of moms buy for their kids I don't think that's even possible grandma Christmas presents maybe
[467:38.66]Dribble Drop is a standalone game, and it costs about $6, so it's a great deal, actually.
[467:50.15]That's awesome.
[467:50.67]I love how you know that.
[467:53.65]That's kind of... It is worth it.
[467:55.65]Maybe it is.
[468:00.98]Thank you, SashaRee, for the $5.
[468:02.12]This is the worst.
[468:06.15]Okay, we're getting to the point where I slapped myself in the face.
[468:10.15]Thank you for $5, Sashree.
[468:13.48]Mandum Requiem, thanks for the $1.
[468:17.78]Captain Worgen, thanks for $1.
[468:19.12]While watching this stream, I keep having the feeling it's going to cut off suddenly and the old Jerma outro is going to play.
[468:27.15]Not tonight.
[468:32.29]Thank you Resolute Rogue for the $10.
[468:34.29]No message, just thanks for $10.
[468:36.99]Thank you.
[468:37.31]It means a lot.
[468:40.39]Tingy, thanks for $1.
[468:41.55]After that slap, you're going to be on live... Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[468:49.97]It's me slapping myself in the face.
[468:54.71]For some reason, I don't know why, but...
[468:58.12]One anime review.
[468:59.28]Oh yeah, that's right.
[469:00.46]I forgot.
[469:01.26]Huge announcement.
[469:01.94]I watched One Punch Man.
[469:11.34]It was pretty great.
[469:13.92]That was my 2019 anime.
[469:15.48]I'm only allowed to watch one.
[469:18.64]I thought it was really good.
[469:22.38]I liked the characters.
[469:24.48]Interesting concept.
[469:26.52]See you in 2020.
[469:40.33]Season 2 is coming out too.
[469:41.35]Yeah, I like when he punches people in one time.
[469:43.80]You know what I mean?
[469:48.09]Hey, thanks for the emote, though.
[469:50.23]Well, maybe it wouldn't be an emote.
[469:51.97]I don't know.
[469:52.31]Maybe.
[469:53.43]Hey, the wombat from hell, thanks for the $1.
[469:54.87]I'm almost done with my senior year, but I feel worse than I ever have in my life because of what my doctor believes to be IBS and OAB.
[470:03.56]I feel useless, vulnerable, and like I can't go anywhere without risking pain all the time.
[470:06.96]I know you struggle with something similar in your youth, and I was wondering if you had any advice for managing getting through embarrassing medical problems at a young age.
[470:16.50]Well,
[470:18.55]First of all, sorry that you're going through that, because it sucks.
[470:22.19]Second of all, uh, it is a, it's a never-ending process.
[470:27.05]Sometimes... I've actually, I've been, I've felt pretty good in the, kind of, IBD department.
[470:36.42]But, I've been having some issues recently.
[470:40.46]But you just gotta get a good doctor.
[470:42.90]Try to get a good doctor that gives a shit.
[470:46.27]And you just gotta try to manage it with medicine.
[470:50.59]Sometimes you might have to change your diet.
[470:55.42]That was a big one for me.
[471:02.68]Try to keep a positive outlook, even though it's hard to do.
[471:07.93]I had a lot of fucking problems.
[471:09.29]I had.
[471:10.23]I missed.
[471:12.01]get-togethers, family events.
[471:14.97]I almost missed my sister's wedding because of that shit.
[471:18.87]I almost couldn't go or participate in my sister's goddamn wedding.
[471:23.57]So I know what it's like.
[471:24.55]I know how that feels.
[471:30.27]Ah, but a couple years later, maybe three years later, four years later, I started to feel better.
[471:34.02]I was on a good program.
[471:39.10]Started doing a different medical procedure.
[471:45.58]And I... I'm still... I'm still going.
[471:49.14]And I feel better than I did.
[471:50.64]Absolutely.
[471:52.84]Six, seven, eight years ago.
[471:59.85]Just keep at it.
[472:03.69]It's tough.
[472:04.49]It really... It sucks.
[472:05.99]And I wish there was some magic wand that I could wave.
[472:08.73]To give you the answers.
[472:10.93]And to tell you that... You know, I want to get rid of it.
[472:14.24]I wish I could.
[472:22.67]I love how somebody just wrote, yeah, fuck the Patriots.
[472:25.29]Honestly.
[472:28.33]What conversation are you having?
[472:32.75]What?
[472:42.40]Oh.
[472:46.12]But yeah.
[472:47.58]That's the best advice I can give.
[472:49.08]Try to keep... It's really easy to be negative.
[472:53.51]And to fall into the negative trap.
[473:00.25]Just try to balance your diet out.
[473:04.68]And listen to your doctor.
[473:06.04]And go from there.
[473:10.08]Jeremy, have you ever thought about that you're a gnome because of how small that I am?
[473:15.06]No.
[473:15.32]Gnomes are a foot and a half tall.
[473:20.40]Please.
[473:21.10]Please.
[473:21.56]Do not put me.
[473:22.57]Excuse me.
[473:24.79]I'm at least... I'm at least a high elf, okay?
[473:29.03]At least give me that.
[473:37.11]At least.
[473:47.21]And I'm at least an elf.
[473:49.33]And I'm not talking about the Christmas... Pack-your-presents elf.
[473:54.52]I'm talking about a RPG elf.
[473:59.68]God, I wish that was me.
[474:02.76]Hey, mostly lost.
[474:04.68]Thanks for $1.
[474:05.91]Those hidden object games were just somebody's sophomore project in Computer Science 210 that they tried to make money off of by copying 20 times.
[474:15.89]Maybe, yeah.
[474:16.41]I don't understand how... I guess you just have to bloat it up.
[474:23.20]Darkstar, 700,000 games thanks to the $1.
[474:25.40]You have to watch the slap clip again at half speed.
[474:28.90]It makes it infinitely funnier.
[474:36.65]Where is it?
[474:37.17]How do I do that?
[474:44.92]Give me a fucking break.
[474:55.43]Oh, you want to fight?
[474:56.21]You want to fight?
[475:00.77]Fight me.
[475:01.19]Don't fuck.
[475:18.28]I don't know if I'm ready for this.
[475:19.38]Oh, you want to fight?
[475:24.08]You want to fight?
[475:24.82]Don't fuck.
[475:26.75]Hold on.
[475:37.49]Alright, here we go.
[475:39.33]Let's see what it's like.
[475:46.90]You want to fight?
[475:48.30]You want to fight?
[475:49.74]Don't fuck with that.
[475:51.28]Don't.
[476:03.41]Runk.
[476:05.19]This is stone cold sober.
[476:08.23]This is on... This is on caffeine and spaghetti.
[476:13.97]You wanna fight?
[476:18.54]You wanna fuck?
[476:19.50]Fight?
[476:20.00]Don't fuck with that.
[476:22.62]Don't.
[476:33.01]You can see me trying to pull it back too.
[476:34.85]That's the worst part.
[476:38.43]What a fucking moron.
[477:03.20]It synced so well that it's the game sound.
[477:05.66]It is the game sound because I was... Play the other one.
[477:09.19]The other sound is the same exact sound.
[477:10.91]Remember when I did it the first time?
[477:23.38]Can I fart backwards?
[477:24.88]What does that even mean?
[477:25.76]Alright, we're almost done.
[477:28.34]Thank you to MostlyLostForTheOneDoll.
[477:32.19]Garfield the Monday killer, thanks for $1.
[477:33.51]Hold on, is this it?
[477:38.31]This is just so fucking irritating.
[477:44.33]Yeah, see?
[477:48.55]Listen to that sound.
[477:52.37]That's the first one.
[477:53.74]Fucking irritating.
[478:02.74]Lies, what?
[478:12.72]Uh, but thank you, Garfield.
[478:13.54]Swiggity Swanky gave me a sub, so I'm going to give him a Swiggity Thanky.
[478:17.35]All the cats in the chat are nuts about your stream, Jerma.
[478:19.47]Make yourselves known, cats in chat.
[478:21.93]Give us some of those poggers in here.
[478:27.03]The crowd is going nuts.
[478:28.45]Garf is honored to be the honorary feline ambassador
[478:32.88]To the Jerma brand.
[478:37.10]Years from now, people are going to look back on these streams and say, that's Garf up there, up on the stairs.
[478:41.83]I don't know why I'm up on the stairs.
[478:43.19]I probably got shipped off to space.
[478:45.67]Stars.
[478:50.79]Golden Cricket.
[478:51.45]Thank you, Garfield.
[478:52.07]Thank you, Golden Cricket, for the $4.
[478:53.49]Good stream, Germbo.
[478:54.71]Here is Celeryman.
[478:56.15]Now, Tane, I can get into.
[478:57.25]Oh, yeah, I know what Celeryman is.
[479:07.90]Could you kick up the 4D 3D?
[479:12.29]Could you kick up the 4D 3D?
[479:16.45]Thank you, Golden Cricket.
[479:17.53]It's a classic.
[479:19.60]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for $1.
[479:20.86]Guy on the tennis championship icon is me doing the walk, in quotes.
[479:27.39]Maybe.
[479:28.23]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[479:29.47]The chat draws a phallus on screen joke.
[479:31.68]Will never not be funny because every time you just know that a room of 5,000 people all without words knew what they would do.
[479:41.94]Yeah.
[479:44.72]SirDub, thanks for the $1.
[479:45.74]I've been watching your streams for about a year.
[479:47.86]I'm hoping this 2019 goes well for the stream.
[479:49.92]I also suggest a game called Infamous.
[479:51.77]I feel like you might like it.
[479:55.29]Yeah, Infamous.
[479:56.13]It's cool.
[479:57.84]It's on the radar.
[479:59.10]I actually was thinking about doing it a couple days ago.
[480:02.52]But PS Now doesn't really work that well for me.
[480:07.00]So I would probably want to figure out a way to do it without PS Now.
[480:10.87]He'll look into it.
[480:14.33]Thank you, SirDub.
[480:15.29]Thank you, MetalSox, for the $10 Super Frog or Riot.
[480:19.07]Played it in the... It was the first one we played.
[480:22.12]Thank you for the $10.
[480:22.98]Appreciate it.
[480:26.94]Thank you Compact Viewer for the $10.
[480:30.03]It's been a few years now since my friend introduced me to you.
[480:33.11]We used to watch your videos on the way home from school on the bus.
[480:35.99]Thanks for all the good memories.
[480:37.65]A fan.
[480:40.60]Happy to be there.
[480:41.82]On the bus.
[480:44.94]Thank you so much for watching for as long as you have.
[480:49.36]Compact Viewer, thanks for the $10.
[480:53.80]Am I the only one who wants Jerma to go with his dream cast promise?
[480:57.51]He's just been delaying it for so long, it makes me sad.
[480:59.91]It is just sitting back there.
[481:12.20]That's what the ghost was, guys.
[481:13.76]Look.
[481:15.24]The ghost is the dream cast.
[481:18.20]Look.
[481:20.70]You see?
[481:20.98]You see?
[481:22.94]Can you see the Dreamcast?
[481:24.24]It's right there.
[481:25.46]On the right side.
[481:27.04]Top right, next to the door.
[481:29.50]That's what the ghost was all along.
[481:38.47]Hey, Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $1.
[481:40.25]I can't believe you lied about not liking anime.
[481:43.13]How can I watch a streamer who watches anime?
[481:45.09]I'm so disappointed.
[481:52.37]It's a TV show.
[481:54.59]It's a television show.
[482:00.72]So he's never going to play Dreamcast because it's a ghost.
[482:08.15]Look, I don't base what genre of TV show or movie I'm going to watch.
[482:14.73]How do people rate it?
[482:15.55]Is it rated?
[482:17.96]Has it got like an 89%?
[482:20.24]78%?
[482:20.90]I might watch it.
[482:26.48]It was enjoyable.
[482:28.28]I'm not going to go get a One Punch Man 14 inch figurine to put on my desk.
[482:34.97]I'm not going to dress up as Saitama for Halloween this year.
[482:42.67]I'm not going to order the Blu-rays through Amazon Prime.
[482:48.04]All of those things are lies.
[482:49.80]And they're all on the way.
[482:54.83]Ah, thank you.
[482:55.29]Bonjour!
[482:56.01]Thank you.
[482:57.51]Bonjour, Tristan, for the $1.
[483:00.65]Bonjour, Tristan, again, for the $1.
[483:02.74]Dermot, please read this out loud.
[483:06.20]Hold on.
[483:07.10]Wait.
[483:16.17]What happened to F?
[483:22.34]What?
[483:23.28]F. It was a sign of respect.
[483:30.40]I lost two ranks in League.
[483:35.29]What happened?
[483:36.07]I don't get it.
[483:38.55]This is how you meme kids are repaying me.
[483:45.67]Thank you, Double D, for the $1.
[483:47.23]It's a clip.
[483:48.69]I'm not gonna help!
[483:55.85]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $1.
[483:57.26]This is a fever dream.
[483:58.76]It sure is.
[484:00.00]SpaceDad, thanks for the $1.
[484:02.32]FGWGWF, thanks for the $5.
[484:04.30]All these games that won't open are all going to open at the same time later tonight.
[484:08.19]And nuke your PC.
[484:10.85]Oh, that would be terrifying.
[484:16.15]Thank you, Zaldi, for the $1.
[484:18.17]Jerma, let's be real.
[484:19.22]The follow-through on your pimp hand is godlike.
[484:25.43]Thank you Jax for the $5.
[484:27.11]Jax3636, thank you for $5.
[484:34.04]Appreciate it.
[484:35.38]DemonicCucumber, thanks for the $1.
[484:36.74]This Connect Four game isn't fair.
[484:37.96]You could literally see the next three moves we were planning from the get-go.
[484:41.46]If you want it to be fair, bring in a mediator or let us vote on grid references.
[484:47.62]No, you guys can click the screen.
[484:49.18]You know what you're doing.
[484:51.49]Hey, Ike Turtle, thanks for the $1.
[484:52.51]I even thought about doing board games with chat, like a bunch of stuff.
[484:55.64]Tonight's stream with the Connect Four was pretty fun.
[484:57.26]I think it would be wicked rad to do other games against it as well.
[485:01.66]Also, we can see how you cheat in other games as well.
[485:09.25]If there was a system in place where you, because it is, it's actually really hard to do what we were doing.
[485:13.96]Because I have to activate the extension, let you guys vote, turn it off, and restart it.
[485:23.30]For every single time you guys could click on the screen.
[485:26.62]So if there was a more streamlined way to do that, I would love to.
[485:35.01]It's an interesting idea.
[485:36.09]If there's some extension or something in the future.
[485:38.91]Might be worth trying.
[485:42.63]But it was fun.
[485:43.69]I had a blast.
[485:46.61]3TSLuke, thanks for the $5.
[485:48.21]I haven't donated since you were in Anor Londo.
[485:52.44]So here's more patronage.
[485:55.02]Patronage.
[485:56.98]I just said patronage.
[485:59.88]The internet has destroyed me.
[486:03.42]Thank you, Fuzzy Muffins, for the $10.
[486:05.96]Thank you for playing with us, Jerma.
[486:07.37]GG, idiot.
[486:08.95]You know you love it.
[486:11.93]Thank you, Fuzzy Muffins, for the $10.
[486:13.61]I do.
[486:14.31]It's always fun.
[486:16.55]Darkstar, 700,000 games.
[486:18.11]Thanks for the $1.
[486:18.77]Just thought I'd ruin Connect 4 for you.
[486:21.88]Alright.
[486:22.66]If neither player makes a mistake during the game, the winner will be determined by where the first piece was placed.
[486:28.24]If the first piece is placed on either end, that player will lose.
[486:33.38]If the first piece is placed in the center, that player will win.
[486:37.10]And if the first piece is placed in the in-between, it will result in a draw.
[486:45.76]Good to know.
[486:46.34]From when I want to beat my friends.
[486:48.90]I mean, and I already did.
[486:50.27]Tonight.
[486:52.11]You know, you know, you two.
[486:53.81]You two.
[486:54.66]Beat you guys.
[486:55.38]You two there.
[486:58.40]The two of you that were playing.
[486:59.85]Mostly lost thanks to the $1 of the game.
[487:01.41]Probably stole your stream key.
[487:04.18]Let's hope not.
[487:05.08]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $1.
[487:06.44]Another good stream, Jerma.
[487:07.38]Hope the Wild Tangent Studio doesn't have your credit card and charge you 50 times for 50 more 700,000 games.
[487:14.61]Anyway, I would recommend playing Fallout 1.
[487:16.49]I just started playing it and the first thought I had was, well, Jerma would enjoy this.
[487:21.67]Anyways, again, have a good night, Jerma, and chat.
[487:24.91]You as well, Peaceful Haley.
[487:26.88]Fallout 1 is a very, very, very fun game.
[487:30.62]It's kind of like Kenshi.
[487:35.44]And I know that comparison is very, very thin, but... It's in the same house as Kenshi.
[487:44.87]They live in different rooms.
[487:49.11]It's like Kenshi, but fun.
[487:51.17]Alright, I am not gonna let somebody in the chat say that Kenshi's not fun.
[487:57.52]Okay?
[487:58.18]Because that... I don't believe that that is true.
[488:00.70]I believe that that is not true.
[488:03.52]Okay.
[488:04.20]I believe that that's not true.
[488:06.68]Done.
[488:07.92]And now you triggered him.
[488:11.62]Space Dad, thanks for the one dollar.
[488:13.28]They just have a heart.
[488:13.90]Thank you.
[488:15.15]Thank you, Space Dad.
[488:15.85]Thank you... Tybe?
[488:18.87]Tib?
[488:20.77]I'm gonna call you Hovercat.
[488:22.17]Because that's the end of your name.
[488:23.99]And my brain cannot say the first part.
[488:26.49]Thank you, Hovercat, for the $10.
[488:27.37]Hey, Jerma, love your streams.
[488:28.95]A lot of folks in chat look up to you and consider you a positive role model in their lives.
[488:33.89]My question to you is, who do you look up to and consider to be positive role models in your life?
[488:39.11]Thanks for all that you do.
[488:39.83]Never stop being you.
[488:42.78]Um... I don't know.
[488:45.28]Years ago... I would have probably told you.
[488:52.90]George Washington.
[488:57.39]Role models?
[488:58.11]I don't know about role models.
[489:04.31]I mean... This is a young Jeremy answer.
[489:11.33]And people are probably going to put LUL in the chat for this one.
[489:14.76]But it's probably Hulk Hogan.
[489:25.50]Hulk Hogan?
[489:30.48]When I was in my early teens... Oh, man.
[489:40.17]I mean, not anymore.
[489:40.97]I don't... I don't like... Oh, yeah.
[489:43.39]Hulk Hogan!
[489:45.19]No, but in my kind of younger years... Probably was Hulk Hogan.
[489:56.06]Into my late teens and teens and probably 20s, probably Jim Carrey.
[490:01.49]I'm literally one of my favorite comedic actors ever.
[490:07.70]Jim Carrey has influenced so much in the world of comedy that it's absolutely unbelievable.
[490:18.64]You go watch that string of Jim Carrey 90s movies.
[490:25.43]Holy shit.
[490:26.73]They are...
[490:28.25]They're unmistakably some of the funniest movies you will ever watch.
[490:36.39]He's changed a lot.
[490:38.35]Right?
[490:39.07]Recently.
[490:40.35]But remember, he's like... He's also gotten older, too.
[490:44.91]He's gotten old.
[490:46.31]He's in his, like, what?
[490:47.15]His 50s?
[490:47.89]Almost his 60s now?
[490:54.21]It's hard to be Jim Carrey.
[490:57.38]The Funny Guy.
[490:58.20]He actually talks about that in that Jim and Andy Netflix original.
[491:04.77]It's worth a watch.
[491:12.50]He's 56.
[491:15.14]Truman Show is one of my favorite movies of all time.
[491:17.00]Oh my god, yeah.
[491:19.32]Truman Show is fantastic.
[491:33.27]I mean, do I agree with literally everything he's said in the last 10 years?
[491:38.49]No.
[491:54.09]Is Jim Carrey your dad?
[491:55.73]Uh, no.
[491:57.69]no but that's pretty much it I would say those two thank you space dad for the five dollars they said uh moi that's moi french champagne uh chuckler cheese thanks for the one dollar uh a bit of caution for lucius three there's a really graphic graphic scene oh dear
[492:25.00]There's some really distasteful steam achievements that go along with it.
[492:29.95]Uh... Well, I'm gonna have to check that.
[492:48.74]The French Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[492:54.93]But thank you for the heads up.
[492:55.89]Thanks for the warning.
[493:02.51]Thank you, Razzle, for the $1.
[493:03.71]Hey, Jerm, sorry to keep you here longer, but I don't... It's fine.
[493:06.50]We're just hanging out.
[493:07.80]But I just had a quick question.
[493:08.70]You are so attentive, plus concerned about the few that don't enjoy your streams.
[493:14.57]How do you deal with negative comments on your YouTube videos back in the day?
[493:19.57]There's a YouTube link.
[493:21.97]Are you linking to a comment here?
[493:23.91]Am I going to feel bad right now?
[493:25.79]Is this going to make me sad?
[493:33.31]It's somebody vaping.
[493:39.51]It was muted, but it was a vape gnome.
[493:44.08]It was a gnome vape joke.
[493:47.54]It was muted, so don't worry.
[493:49.50]How do I... I'm concerned about the few people that don't enjoy the streams.
[493:53.00]I mean, it's not necessarily... I don't think it's a concern about people not enjoying the streams.
[494:01.75]I think it's a... It's more of a concern of people thinking that the thing that they're watching is not worth watching.
[494:11.32]Like, boring.
[494:13.02]I mean, like, enjoying the streams is kind of a hard way to look at it, because...
[494:19.59]You can still enjoy something if it is boring, right?
[494:25.08]There's plenty of things that I enjoy that are boring.
[494:33.35]So not enjoying the streams.
[494:34.79]Yeah, but like there's plenty of things that are boring that you can still enjoy.
[494:43.72]I'm probably wording this in a stupid way.
[494:46.78]But negative comments, you just have to take the opinion and somebody said it for a reason.
[494:53.83]Somebody said something.
[494:55.03]Somebody didn't like something for a particular reason.
[494:58.13]I get what you mean, kind of.
[494:59.41]Well, good.
[495:00.73]It's also been eight hours and I need some spaghetti.
[495:09.15]But you just kind of have to end.
[495:11.22]My internet is like going through a problem right now.
[495:16.75]No, we're good.
[495:17.97]But yeah, you just have to let negative comments, if somebody wants to be mean or negative, actually, and not just... I know a lot of people joke around.
[495:23.53]We go back and forth a lot of times for fun.
[495:27.84]But there's a big difference between mean and fun, right?
[495:30.72]Like actually angry or like hateful.
[495:34.94]And I don't know how I can't change that person's opinion.
[495:37.30]I'm not going to be able to.
[495:40.46]I told you guys this a couple days ago or even like a couple weeks ago.
[495:44.86]I will never say, like, oh, fuck the haters!
[495:48.72]No, because that, I'm not gonna change that person's mind, so why antagonize them?
[495:53.54]Why, why, why try to tell them that they're wrong?
[495:57.23]I'm not gonna change their mind if they don't think I'm funny, if they don't think the streams are funny.
[496:01.87]What?
[496:03.49]That's, that's their opinion, and they're absolutely entitled and have a right to have that opinion.
[496:09.41]I can't tell you that you're, that's wrong.
[496:11.86]Because I don't know your tastes, I don't know what you think is interesting.
[496:15.91]I don't think you're very funny.
[496:17.37]I don't think your streams are good.
[496:19.23]Well, no, you're wrong.
[496:22.82]I mean, am I?
[496:23.92]It's so subjective.
[496:30.02]So I don't want to fight negative opinions because what's the point?
[496:41.48]Just people are going to have different opinions and just that's it.
[496:46.84]That's pretty much what I got to say.
[496:49.82]Hey, P337R, thanks for the three bucks.
[496:51.18]Hey again, Jerma, J-E-R-M-A.
[496:54.16]Will there be a new tier three emote?
[496:56.00]Yes, there will.
[496:57.88]There will.
[497:00.92]I want to make it worth.
[497:03.58]It was worth it before, I think.
[497:05.14]No, it wasn't.
[497:10.97]Make it the witch.
[497:12.05]Oh, God.
[497:12.61]I have to...
[497:15.59]I don't know if I can use that image.
[497:16.97]For people to pay to use that image that I don't own.
[497:20.57]That's kind of a slippery, tricky slope there.
[497:27.96]But we're almost to the end of the bits.
[497:29.20]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[497:30.54]Wait, if I change my name to reference another one of your videos, will you do a sequel to that one too?
[497:36.14]Alright, I guess I'm now Dorkcube7000.
[497:42.41]Thank you, FGW, for the $1.
[497:44.21]Whatever you do, don't read this.
[497:46.15]He's... He's got a knife.
[497:50.11]He's... Alright, I didn't read it.
[497:53.20]Thank you, Darkstar.
[497:53.96]Again, Darkstar, $1.10.
[497:56.40]Is Jerma Slap more or less embarrassing than Jerma Raptor?
[498:03.40]That's tough.
[498:03.82]I don't know.
[498:06.00]No, Jerma Raptor is more embarrassing.
[498:09.11]The slap was an accident.
[498:10.41]The raptor was intentional.
[498:12.37]So, absolutely, the raptor is way more embarrassing.
[498:18.05]Hey, Fitty, thanks for the $1.
[498:19.69]Wow, this stream good.
[498:21.11]Was the stream good?
[498:23.17]Should I watch the VOD?
[498:24.25]Just kidding.
[498:24.71]I watch every single fucking VOD anyways.
[498:28.62]We had fun.
[498:32.72]We had fun.
[498:33.78]I had a great time.
[498:34.68]I'm going to continue it tomorrow.
[498:36.66]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[498:37.70]No message.
[498:38.70]Thank you, Clueless Sniper.
[498:40.18]Fitty, thanks for the $1.
[498:41.00]Did somebody mention Kinect 4?
[498:42.41]That game is solved.
[498:43.91]If you ever want to beat somebody, almost guaranteed.
[498:45.97]Here you go.
[498:47.23]Kinect4.gamesolver.
[498:51.11]Now, I don't want to know that information.
[498:52.37]I feel like it ruins the game.
[498:55.29]Hey, Jeebus, thanks for the $1.
[498:56.83]Pat, suck, go.
[498:58.05]I'm not going to read that out loud.
[499:01.29]And then he wrote, bah, ha, ha.
[499:10.09]That's it for the bits.
[499:10.73]That's for all the credits.
[499:15.11]Here's all the new subs.
[499:15.87]It's a shitload every damn day.
[499:19.06]You guys spoil the fuck out of me.
[499:22.10]Seriously, thank you.
[499:26.76]How do I raid someone?
[499:32.60]I actually don't know how to do this.
[499:37.85]What do I do?
[499:44.65]You type slash raid with their channel name.
[499:48.15]Okay.
[499:57.96]Let me see if it works.
[499:59.94]What's with the FPS here?
[500:08.33]Oh wait, is he offline?
[500:11.33]He's not streaming anymore.
[500:14.42]Well, shit.
[500:25.10]Did he just turn it off?
[500:28.22]Damn it.
[500:34.47]Rate me.
[500:39.57]Who's live right now?
[500:41.49]Games Done Quick is going, but everybody knows that already.
[500:44.61]What's Joel doing?
[500:45.41]Two twists.
[500:48.53]Okay, sending more health?
[500:49.62]Yes.
[500:52.38]San Andreas is a great game.
[500:54.78]Well, let's go say hi to Joel.
[501:04.18]So what happens when I press this button?
[501:05.78]When I hit raid?
[501:16.59]Does my stream turn off?
[501:25.73]It just hosts his channel.
[501:30.48]So, end the stream and then do it.
[501:37.30]How long does it last for?
[501:48.40]So end and then slash raid.
[501:50.34]Let me make sure I get the name right.
[502:02.84]So it does a countdown.
[502:03.80]Okay.
[502:09.45]So you raid before ending the stream.
[502:14.72]I don't know, like, how do you do basic Twitch function?
[502:19.78]A couple more bits came in.
[502:28.91]Thank you, Shawnee Noodles, for the $5.
[502:30.89]Hey, what's up, guy?
[502:31.79]Just wondering if you have any near-future plans to collaborate with Kryken.
[502:36.34]No plans, but I'm always open to it.
[502:38.90]He's a swell guy.
[502:41.89]Dorkcube thanks.
