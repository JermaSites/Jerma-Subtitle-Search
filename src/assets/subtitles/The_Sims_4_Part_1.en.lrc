[00:01.95]Oops.
[00:02.93]Hey!
[00:03.25]Hey guys.
[00:07.49]I hit the wrong button and I didn't have the game captured.
[00:09.81]How you doing?
[00:12.15]Happy Thursday.
[00:12.87]Uh, I gotta write that there's a stream going on right now.
[00:21.18]So let me do that.
[00:24.68]Uh, Sims 4.
[00:25.70]Uh, Monster House.
[00:32.11]Well, that's not even true.
[00:33.01]Hold on.
[00:33.75]We've got a lot of... I got a lot of shit to talk about.
[00:37.01]I got... First of all, how does every stream start?
[00:39.79]I got something that I'm not happy about.
[00:42.15]Something happened today.
[00:43.65]Especially video game related.
[00:45.37]And I want to talk about it.
[00:47.71]Something else happened.
[00:48.45]I talked about like a drive-thru experience I had.
[00:50.41]So we got like two or three things to do here.
[00:54.26]But first of all, let me just... Give me a minute.
[00:56.50]We're going to talk about how EA sucks...
[00:59.20]And what a dumb fucking company.
[01:00.98]Okay, but that's the topic of our discussion before the stream conversation.
[01:07.03]I'll be right back.
[02:19.42]Okay, so I made a tweet.
[02:22.91]Let's turn this volume down here for a second, because this is, I gotta get something off my chest.
[02:29.39]So, over the last few days, since the last stream, I've been perusing EA Games' websites and their various catalog of video games that you can buy from their, I wish I was pretending to be Steam service called Origin.
[02:46.24]And, you know, it's a clean website, Origin, it's a clean client.
[02:51.47]I was perusing mods, too, because I'm going to play The Sims 4.
[02:55.05]And so I get to the point where I'm downloading the Origin Client, I install the Origin Client, and I go to buy The Sims 4.
[03:03.26]Okay, but I already own The Sims 4.
[03:05.62]So, okay, oh yeah, that's right, I made a video on this a few years ago when the game first came out.
[03:10.22]But there's a bunch of expansion packs!
[03:12.12]Okay, cool.
[03:12.84]So there's like 15 to 20 fucking different expansion packs that you can buy for this game and they're all like 20 bucks Forget about how stupid the prices are for this.
[03:20.22]We can talk about just the purchases in general just purchasing in general, right?
[03:25.29]There is no cart on the origin client You can't add things to a cart.
[03:32.05]You have to individually fucking buy every single item on origin.
[03:36.17]Oh
[03:37.99]So, what do I do?
[03:39.91]I'm just like, okay, that's fucking stupid.
[03:41.71]There's no cart.
[03:42.41]I have to individually purchase like 20 expansions.
[03:45.91]Individual transactions.
[03:47.47]Each individual bank account transaction.
[03:49.81]So, I buy two expansions in a row.
[03:53.05]I do a third fucking transaction.
[03:54.96]Yes, verify.
[03:56.20]Oh, what's that?
[03:56.60]Your credit card got declined.
[03:59.90]I got like a fucking text from my bank that was like, hey man, your credit card's acting all fucked up.
[04:04.84]Like somebody's buying a bunch of shit on Origin.
[04:09.14]So I had to go into my bank and be like, no, these transactions are real.
[04:27.69]You have an expansion pack code for city living?
[04:29.33]I already got it, but thank you.
[04:30.49]I appreciate it.
[04:32.03]There's a cart?
[04:32.75]Where's the cart?
[04:33.73]Where's the cart on the origin client?
[04:36.05]Where is it?
[04:38.10]Because I looked this up and there are like posts of people saying, why the fuck is there no cart I can add to?
[04:47.59]Let's find... Right there.
[04:56.37]Okay, EA, if you're gonna have a fucking like a hundred Sims 4 expansion packs and add-ons Where's like the package?
[05:04.51]Where's like the gold, the platinum, the complete bundle?
[05:06.99]Why do you sell them individually?
[05:11.81]What the hell are you doing?
[05:15.24]Nobody wants to individually purchase every single fucking one of these dumb things Look at this
[05:23.71]Expansion packs, game packs, stuff packs.
[05:26.85]They sell some of these in like a one or two bundle.
[05:29.85]Where's the complete version?
[05:35.97]Anyways, welcome to the stream.
[05:37.03]Hi everybody.
[05:38.68]Today we're gonna play The Sims 4.
[05:39.64]Free stuff?
[05:43.94]Yeah, I got my free stuff.
[05:46.92]By the way, each one of these is about 20 fucking dollars.
[05:51.13]Apparently there's like mice in the game that you can buy.
[05:54.49]Oh, okay.
[05:54.97]There's 10 bucks to add like a fucking mouse.
[05:57.05]This is what you get for $10.
[06:00.51]You get a funny jacket for your cat.
[06:02.75]Hold on.
[06:03.01]Why is this cat standing?
[06:10.77]Oh, they added an air purifier.
[06:13.71]And an egg.
[06:16.69]Un-fucking-believable.
[06:19.11]What's this one?
[06:20.15]How about, uh, oh, uh, this one.
[06:22.09]Let's do, uh, Dine Out.
[06:23.87]That's $20.
[06:24.47]For, like, two extra air conditioners in a fucking aquarium.
[06:35.38]Let me cart.
[06:44.51]What is this in the game, but not on the Origin client?
[06:49.43]This isn't in the... This isn't... Oh my god, I bought this all on the Origin client.
[06:55.31]I purchased through Origin.
[06:56.83]I didn't know that there was an in-game, in Sims 4 cart.
[07:00.72]I purchased all this shit on Origin.
[07:02.72]It doesn't exist on Origin.
[07:14.02]Why would there be this in-game in The Sims 4 cart but not on the fucking Origin client?
[07:26.21]That's fucking... Come on, man.
[07:29.46]Holy shit.
[07:38.12]Anyways, alright, now that I got that off my chest,
[07:45.20]No, but really though like give me some slack go to your origin client the thing that you purchase all your origin games and There's no cart No, thanks No one uses origin except for the people that buy the $600 worth of Sims content I
[08:11.33]Pre-order seasons?
[08:12.15]I already got seasons, man.
[08:13.40]It was $40, but it was half off, so it was not even worth buying yet.
[08:18.96]Anyways.
[08:20.96]So.
[08:25.30]Let's go ahead and start playing The Sims.
[08:26.94]Here's my plan with The Sims 4.
[08:31.14]Sims 4 I played it for like a few hours a couple years ago three years ago or so right I didn't get the pets one because at this point I was like at this point my credit card had been declined and I just was like okay we went one two three I did like I had to go and say yes so on the third purchase I would get declined so one two decline one two decline that's what happened
[08:58.98]Let me give you the plan.
[09:00.70]I got a bunch of fucked up mods, okay?
[09:05.34]So, there are a lot of weird fucking mods I have installed right now.
[09:09.94]I'm not sure if I want to use them yet, because I got all these expansion packs...
[09:15.56]We have no nude mods, no sex, although there was something hysterical that I thought would be funny, but I can't do it on Twitch.
[09:23.13]You can install a mod where the characters can have sex anywhere, in the house, outside, in public, and I'm just imagining walking around with two people making sandwiches in the kitchen while the people have sex on the table.
[09:37.78]I mean, that's very funny, but I can't do that on Twitch.
[09:40.18]Just imagine you saw that.
[09:44.14]Just pretend like that was a funny thing you saw tonight, okay?
[09:47.63]Anyways.
[09:49.11]We have... I don't know how to play this game.
[09:52.33]We're going to do it very slowly.
[09:53.31]We're going to be very casual about this.
[09:54.83]Let's play The Sims 4.
[09:56.25]I didn't make this guy.
[10:04.11]But just right off the bat, as you can see, we have some... We have some mods here.
[10:12.83]So, uh, I kind of like this guy the way he is.
[10:16.08]Hold on a minute.
[10:19.12]Alright, let me just break this down.
[10:20.84]Yes, I have a thing that lets you make fucking monsters.
[10:30.73]So, yes, it is available for us to do weird shit like this.
[10:41.69]The one problem, though, is a lot of the other mods to make people huge, this is as big as I can get them.
[10:49.69]The mods where you can really screw around with the bones and the actual body physics, they don't work anymore, unfortunately.
[10:58.23]So this is as small or as large as we could make them in the butt department.
[11:05.17]But I think we can deal with that, I think.
[11:07.87]We'll be fine.
[11:09.50]Anyways, I also have a mod installed that is called the Extreme Violent Serial Killer mod.
[11:16.98]Which means people just kill each other and it's blood and it's awful.
[11:20.16]I don't know if I want to activate it yet because I feel like that's a future thing.
[11:27.65]People walking around with chainsaws and stuff.
[11:29.91]I don't know if I want to do that right now.
[11:32.29]Ooh.
[11:34.22]I mean, it's available.
[11:37.32]And I thought about a scenario where eventually we could build a house and have it be like a clue house with a bunch of weird rooms and somebody's the serial killer and they all have to walk around and figure out who did it.
[11:49.11]I don't even know if that's possible, but we can pretend.
[11:56.11]Anyways, let's just start from the very beginning.
[11:59.43]Who should I make first?
[12:00.77]I think I'm going to make myself.
[12:01.77]I have to be in my own video game here, right?
[12:05.52]So, physical features, yep.
[12:06.66]Alright, body manipulation.
[12:09.00]Click on your Sim's body to modify the physical appearance by dragging and pulling the mouse.
[12:12.84]That's right.
[12:13.22]Okay, I'm gonna make me.
[12:16.24]This looks like a guy I went to high school with.
[12:18.30]I'm not even kidding.
[12:18.96]Okay, so let me go to... Face.
[12:27.62]Alright, well, this is the killer.
[12:29.95]I already found him.
[12:34.77]Alright, so let's go with this.
[12:40.43]Already?
[12:42.05]Alright, so let's make me... Let's start with the hair.
[12:48.76]That's actually pretty close.
[12:52.50]Although it's kind of a brown blonde.
[12:54.30]It's like this.
[12:58.17]It's alright.
[12:58.81]Looks okay.
[12:59.37]I mean, I'm a little gray.
[13:00.19]I'm turning a little gray, I think, eventually here.
[13:04.04]Or this one?
[13:04.92]No, I don't style it up like that.
[13:08.52]Is my shitty Fawquad haircut in here?
[13:13.93]I don't think it is.
[13:34.12]I think I found it.
[13:39.39]Okay, so hair, facial hair, uh, short.
[13:42.37]We need to make this shorter.
[13:45.73]Or should I just keep it like that?
[13:48.01]How am I ever going to find a sim girlfriend?
[13:51.72]No, that's alright.
[13:52.30]That works.
[13:53.54]Although I do have to get rid of this stupid facial hair.
[13:56.94]He's got like a chin strap.
[13:58.22]I don't have that.
[14:05.34]I do have a pretty pronounced chin, though, I will say.
[14:11.94]This is what I'm going to look like in ten years.
[14:17.06]I will look like this, you understand.
[14:18.70]Especially if I have longer hair.
[14:22.87]That's okay.
[14:24.19]My head's not... I kind of have a small head.
[14:32.23]Let's pull this in.
[14:39.28]What does my nose look like?
[14:40.28]I have a bigger bridge, though.
[14:43.08]Like that.
[14:54.67]I need a bridge to come out.
[14:55.79]There we go.
[15:00.91]My mouth is a little bigger than this.
[15:04.58]Looks about right.
[15:10.05]I mean, that is my big mouth.
[15:12.25]I have a huge mouth.
[15:13.01]And my eyes... I kind of have bigger eyes.
[15:21.22]Not that big, though.
[15:29.55]Holy shit.
[15:30.65]Now, my eyebrows.
[15:31.69]Let's get some... I actually have to... Let's go into my actual eyebrows here.
[15:42.65]That's pretty close.
[15:47.31]Tilt him in.
[15:47.85]No, no, no, no.
[15:49.53]My head's skinny like that.
[15:50.59]Okay.
[15:52.34]That looks alright so far.
[15:54.48]Actual physical eyes, though, need to be moved.
[15:58.20]Do I have frog eyes?
[16:02.26]I don't really have frog eyes like that.
[16:09.29]Looks alright.
[16:10.57]Although I need to change the eye shape.
[16:21.34]You know, I can't wait till I get stabbed by the murderer.
[16:24.02]Like, honestly.
[16:26.78]I got blue eyes.
[16:28.50]Actually, they're more like a slate.
[16:30.01]You know what I mean?
[16:32.13]It's like that.
[16:35.49]That's alright.
[16:36.03]I'll have it like this.
[16:37.05]Make him a little bigger.
[16:41.03]I think that looks like... That looks like me, doesn't it?
[16:51.71]I thought the nose is wrong.
[16:58.01]That's not correct.
[17:05.32]Oh, I know I fucked it all up.
[17:06.32]Hold on.
[17:10.08]Plague doctor.
[17:11.36]It really was a plague doctor.
[17:19.66]Alright, that's close enough.
[17:20.90]The mouth needs to be a little bit bigger.
[17:27.71]My head's not that... I gotta come down a little bit here.
[17:32.47]Let's go to the head.
[17:33.11]That looks good.
[17:38.72]I'm having a pee brain.
[17:43.14]Hold on.
[17:45.00]Okay.
[17:47.71]Body manipulation.
[17:48.85]Click here to define your sim's body shape and clothing.
[17:51.03]Alright, body.
[17:55.59]It's a weird, like, anteater body that I have.
[17:59.61]I kind of, actually, I do kind of have a weird anteater body, don't I?
[18:03.68]I do.
[18:08.48]Really small chest, kind of fat stomach, big hips.
[18:13.84]Long arms, skinny.
[18:17.17]Wide shoulders.
[18:17.91]That is... I look like this.
[18:19.27]I have a huge ass, too.
[18:25.84]Okay.
[18:30.70]My waist is thin.
[18:34.78]I have big hands.
[18:37.00]I got really big hands, actually.
[18:38.58]Alright, body.
[18:39.06]Where's my hands?
[18:42.00]Get in there.
[18:44.81]Can I grab the hands here?
[18:49.98]I got bigger feet, though.
[18:51.36]I got little shins.
[18:54.88]You definitely don't have big hands.
[18:56.06]Yes, I do.
[18:58.22]What do I wear for clothes?
[18:59.30]Let's see.
[19:01.32]I don't wear that.
[19:06.65]I feel like I would wear this eventually.
[19:08.09]No, not that either.
[19:19.26]Horizontal stripes are not nice on me.
[19:26.83]What do I wear for clothes?
[19:28.01]I don't wear clothes.
[19:29.59]That's the thing.
[19:32.73]I never wear clothes.
[19:36.59]I don't have... I don't have clothes on now.
[19:38.83]Is there like a... Okay, there we go.
[19:45.71]That's better.
[19:47.57]That's better.
[19:48.03]Okay, so now the pants.
[19:51.13]Go to the bottoms.
[19:54.07]Take off the swimwear.
[19:56.93]Wear pajama pants.
[19:59.41]Webcam, no.
[20:00.95]I'll get banned from Twitch.
[20:01.73]I'm naked.
[20:04.20]There we go.
[20:04.62]No, I never wear belts either.
[20:07.78]This is too nice.
[20:08.78]It's gotta be... Here we go.
[20:11.60]Perfect.
[20:12.22]No, I gotta get that top off.
[20:19.35]Get the top off.
[20:26.33]Go back to the pants.
[20:29.27]Why is it changing?
[20:30.44]Stop changing, dude.
[20:33.38]That's fine.
[20:43.06]There we go.
[20:43.60]That's better.
[20:47.48]Click the X on the section.
[20:51.16]Yeah, then it deletes it all.
[20:53.16]Okay, so now... Just need to go to... I'm actually wearing these right now.
[21:01.53]I got these on right now.
[21:03.89]They're the exact same color and everything.
[21:06.83]Perfect.
[21:07.27]Alright, shoes.
[21:12.22]Let's just go with a pair of slippers.
[21:18.19]I just went flip-flops.
[21:21.22]And they're blue.
[21:26.04]Okay, looks alright.
[21:27.36]My neck is too skinny a neck.
[21:32.63]Okay, that looks alright.
[21:37.69]Accessories.
[21:38.41]I don't have any accessories, really.
[21:40.51]No, I don't hold, like... Is it a stake?
[21:43.89]Is this part of a mod?
[21:44.62]Okay.
[21:49.08]Yeah, okay, this is part of the murder people mod.
[21:59.82]Take this off.
[22:01.28]I'm not walking around with a knife.
[22:02.52]That means I'm the serial killer.
[22:03.70]No, I don't... Let me see.
[22:11.58]That's a chainsaw.
[22:13.18]Don't need that right now.
[22:16.94]Okay.
[22:17.70]Oh, there's a gun.
[22:23.04]Oh, what are these weird rubber gloves?
[22:25.08]I feel like I would wear these.
[22:25.96]No, I wouldn't.
[22:28.90]This is my swimwear look.
[22:30.36]Oh, fuck.
[22:31.07]Okay.
[22:32.11]Every day.
[22:33.53]Oh, goddammit.
[22:34.83]What the hell is that shit called again?
[22:36.17]Okay, every day.
[22:42.97]Take the top off.
[22:45.69]How do I do naked?
[22:47.55]Can I just do none?
[22:50.73]Filter items.
[22:51.53]Oh, I just have to find it again.
[22:55.44]I thought that was the swimwear category, that's why I did that.
[23:05.10]Look of a nun.
[23:08.93]No, where's nun?
[23:12.63]Go to the next wheel?
[23:18.19]Full body?
[23:19.25]Maybe?
[23:25.22]Okay.
[23:27.02]X on category.
[23:30.74]He's talking about up here.
[23:31.40]Alright, that's fine.
[23:38.43]Uh... No, I'm not gonna wear the hot dog suit, guys.
[23:45.29]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[23:45.91]Okay.
[23:50.30]No, I'm not putting on... I'm not doing the memes shit.
[23:53.07]I'm not doing the funny look at me.
[23:54.31]I made a YouTube video of The Sims, and I made myself a hot dog costume.
[23:57.85]I'm not doing that.
[24:00.75]How's that look?
[24:01.25]Good?
[24:03.46]Is this Darth Vader?
[24:07.04]Why is there a Darth Vader?
[24:09.12]Oh, that's right, because EA owns Disney.
[24:12.02]The other way around.
[24:15.54]Okay, well, let's just go back to here.
[24:18.09]Take it all off.
[24:19.55]And then go to bottoms.
[24:22.47]I'm going to find my pajamas that they are.
[24:27.45]EA owns everything.
[24:29.67]Every day, I need my... My shoes again.
[24:34.38]Flip flops.
[24:36.18]No.
[24:36.66]I know everyone's going to want me to put the clown shoes on, but I'm sorry, guys.
[24:39.54]At some point, it becomes too much of a joke.
[24:42.18]And I'm not going to do it.

[25:38.75]What the hell are these things?

[31:44.22]Okay.
[31:44.84]Okay.
[31:49.94]Sluggish.
[31:53.72]Bouncy Tsar, right?
[32:03.81]Should I just do the Worgen?

[39:19.08]Yeah, beard and hair for the crust.
[39:20.70]Don't worry, I will.
[39:21.48]I think this is better.
[39:22.86]It's more bread.
[39:23.44]Yeah, we'll give him crust.
[39:25.74]He has gold teeth.
[39:29.39]Yeah, he's a piece of bread, man.
[39:31.91]Oh-ho!
[39:33.55]Makeup.

[40:07.79]That could be crust.
[40:14.65]It's gotta be flat.
[40:15.43]There we go.
[40:15.85]Perfect.
[40:20.60]I gotta take his eyebrows off.
[40:26.40]I'll delete his eyebrows.
[40:27.92]Okay, now... What about sideburns?
[40:36.91]Facial hair.
[40:38.93]Is there a sideburn or anything?
[40:44.77]He don't look right from the side at all.
[40:52.72]No, that doesn't...
[41:02.89]No, we can't.
[41:04.07]It's too much.
[41:04.61]He doesn't have hairy bread.
[41:16.82]Can I just click here?
[41:24.10]Not really.
[41:24.56]Alright, I gotta make his... Oh, shit.
[41:26.66]No, no, no.
[41:29.42]Okay.
[41:30.60]Can I widen his head?
[41:33.80]I mean, I know I'm not supposed to because he's a piece of bread, but seriously, he's impossible to look at.
[41:38.08]He's an eyesore to look at.
[41:42.85]Let's go to... Let's go to the face.
[41:45.25]I need to get... His eyebrows need to be changed.
[41:50.17]I mean, none.
[41:51.69]There we go.
[41:53.21]Perfect.
[41:56.43]I have to move his eyes around, though.
[42:01.11]Let's try to move his eyes a little...
[42:07.48]That looks alright.
[42:08.22]That looks better.
[42:08.70]These eyelids need to move.
[42:22.38]I gotta grab the eyelid detail edit.
[42:26.78]No, what the fuck, man?
[42:32.32]Okay.
[42:33.07]Eyelid.
[42:33.33]There it is.
[42:41.28]He's gotta come down more.
[42:42.42]There we go.
[42:49.30]Holy shit.
[42:49.98]Okay, that's... That's the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life, but it's okay.
[42:54.34]Don't worry, we'll kill him.
[42:55.59]I'll stab him in the stomach the first time we get a chance.
[42:58.55]What about Glass?
[42:59.07]Should he have glasses on?
[42:59.91]Look, he's like a wild and crazy guy, right?
[43:08.25]No.
[43:09.27]Doesn't fit.
[43:12.12]Necklaces, glasses, earrings.
[43:13.96]He has earrings on, doesn't he?
[43:15.02]No.
[43:15.53]Okay.
[43:18.51]So let's go back.
[43:19.47]That's his everyday wear.
[43:20.33]That's fine.
[43:22.19]We gotta make him a little larger than this.
[43:26.15]Because he's a piece of bread, right?
[43:31.74]Shoulders would be a little bit smaller.
[43:34.72]Big hands, big biceps, big legs.
[43:45.22]That looks good, alright now what would he what would what would brad be wearing he's got a doughy butt Uh, put him just alright, that's good that matches Give him the armor put him in a suit
[44:18.25]So he's just being a suit.
[44:21.88]Nope.
[44:29.10]No, that doesn't... No, not in a toaster.
[44:30.70]No.
[44:41.11]No.
[44:41.95]No.
[44:43.47]In the towel...
[44:49.03]Maybe should it be in a towel?
[44:52.71]I don't know, guys.
[44:53.65]I think that's pretty good.
[44:54.85]That's a pretty great television commercial bread mascot.
[44:58.13]I don't know about you.
[45:06.74]But I think we got it.
[45:09.76]Okay.
[45:11.00]Let's take this out.

[45:16.36]Okay.
[45:17.56]So, let's talk about his formal wear.
[45:27.81]His mouth is fucking freaking me out.
[45:30.53]Um... Wait, could that be more bread?
[45:37.85]Is he wrapped up in something?
[45:41.65]Like the head bigger?
[45:42.64]Hmm.
[45:50.50]Bread isn't usually in a plastic bag, right?
[45:52.44]So wouldn't this make sense?
[45:58.77]He wants to look nice.
[45:59.59]Is he gonna go in the plastic bag?

[54:49.64]Let's get rid of those eyebrows.
[54:54.20]Let's remove the hair.
[54:55.04]I gotta get rid of these eyebrows.
[55:05.84]His eyes are actually pretty large.
[55:14.08]They're just big, so they're very... They're not... They're kind of close to his nose, too.
[55:24.16]How big is... His pupils are tiny.
[55:25.48]I don't think I can make them any smaller than that.
[55:37.28]Let's get a big bulb for a nose.
[55:44.02]The chin has to come up.
[55:44.86]This is too big.
[55:45.61]His chin has to come up.
[55:46.45]Okay.
[55:57.55]Uh, how do I bring this up?
[56:06.06]Okay, that looks alright.
[56:09.08]Looks like he could shrink the ears.
[56:13.75]He doesn't look right.
[56:14.95]That doesn't look like Skeeter.
[56:16.13]Hold on.
[56:16.73]I know what Skeeter looks like.
[56:17.93]Just wait.
[56:19.51]I gotta get rid of those eyebrows.
[56:20.65]It's causing problems.
[56:24.64]Face.
[56:27.32]Hair.
[56:29.92]Eyebrows.
[56:31.28]Why can I not take them off?
[56:40.60]There we go.
[56:41.96]Chin comes down.
[56:42.60]Can you see his mouth?
[56:43.34]What does his mouth look like?
[56:45.22]Let's see.
[56:47.68]Skeeter teaches you how to dance.
[56:51.67]Okay.
[56:52.09]His eyes are huge, actually.
[56:59.31]How am I going to get into that mouth?
[57:01.59]There we go.
[57:08.53]There it is.
[57:10.03]He didn't have a neck.
[57:11.19]He barely had a chin.
[57:14.57]The eyes have to become much larger than this, though.
[57:18.81]There we go.
[57:20.99]And they were almost popping out of his head.
[57:22.89]I wish I could get rid of these.
[57:31.67]I mean, he did have little eyebrows, but...
[57:38.55]I mean, what am I going to do about it?
[57:40.53]Okay.
[57:45.10]And he's got a little tiny neck.
[57:49.26]This doesn't look correct.
[57:50.96]Something's really off about him.
[57:54.66]I've got to move his head this way.
[57:56.46]It looks a little bit better.
[58:12.41]I've ruined it.
[58:14.23]No, I didn't.
[58:14.67]What do you mean I ruined it?
[58:15.63]I got it.
[58:24.59]His nose is not... It's like a bulb.
[58:27.13]I have to get rid of the nostrils.
[58:33.94]It's so hard to get in there.
[58:35.06]Get in there.
[58:36.82]His nose is too big.
[58:37.94]I can't... There we go.
[58:49.26]Like that.
[58:49.99]Okay, that's better.
[58:55.13]Pull this in.
[58:58.41]Pull this in.
[59:04.84]This is not Skater anymore.
[59:08.44]I think this might have to go in the trash.
[59:12.35]What color are his eyes?
[59:12.93]He's got like black eyes.
[59:22.22]It's Megamind.
[59:25.74]There we go.
[59:26.30]Alright, he's coming along.
[59:32.60]I don't want... I think I was going to let this kid loose in the world, and I don't think he's going to be in the family.
[59:42.81]Does he get to wear a hat?
[59:50.89]Oh, you just have Yoda.
[59:56.67]What the fuck is that?
[59:58.09]Why is this available?
[59:59.50]I don't even know what that is.
[60:01.06]Why does he have like a helmet on?
[60:02.54]He looks like he's a chocolate bunny.
[60:04.38]What is this?
[60:19.01]Alright.
[60:20.99]Okay, we're just throwing this kid in the trash.
[60:28.70]That's Skeeter Sia.
[60:29.66]Alright, uh, he's gonna be really creative.
[60:33.04]And he's very cheerful.
[60:36.03]Good.
[60:36.45]Alright.
[60:37.83]Uh... And his relationship... No, he's not my roommate.
[60:43.95]He's not my brother.
[60:45.31]Oh, goddammit.
[60:46.21]No, I don't want him in the house.
[60:47.23]He's not my roommate.
[60:54.46]How do I kick him out of the house?
[60:59.44]no he's my father he's gone you don't he never existed alright here we go let's go uh let's start with this I had the right idea
[61:28.33]The idea was correct.
[61:29.99]The execution was not there.
[61:34.71]Let's start with this.
[61:38.71]The nose has to go out like that.
[61:40.85]Okay.
[61:46.01]Chin up.
[61:51.29]Hair needs to be changed.
[61:53.23]Just make another one of me.
[61:57.81]It doesn't need to be that crazy.
[61:59.07]It gets to a point where it's just ridiculous, right?
[62:01.91]So we're gonna make it normal.
[62:06.84]Okay, well that's not normal.
[62:12.68]This is one of the seven dwarves.
[62:13.70]What's his name?
[62:14.08]Sleepy?
[62:17.03]Yeah, this is Sleepy the dwarf.
[62:19.99]Except he's huge.
[62:20.85]That doesn't make any sense.
[62:33.80]Looks like a comic a Saturday morning cartoon or Sunday morning comic strip character That's a little bit better bring the eyes down Uh, we need to the facial hair it's got to be a little bit more it's got to be messier than that
[63:04.63]No, that's not what I want.
[63:25.04]Can I bring this out?
[63:26.24]OK, like that.
[63:27.08]I'm just going to name this guy The Creep.
[63:42.48]oh my god who's the guy that he looks like though I don't remember who he is he's from a comic panel he's probably one of those strips he's staying like that I'm gonna make him jacked too make him huge ah
[64:09.65]Make him as big as I can.
[64:10.71]I just made the Chad.
[64:14.43]Well, the Chad doesn't have like a huge nose.
[64:25.50]Make Garfield.
[64:26.34]No, I'm not making Garfield.
[64:27.70]Okay.
[64:31.42]Hello, my name is.
[64:32.48]No.
[64:32.94]Oh, let's go with every day.
[64:44.17]Alright, well, let's make him like the prim and proper one.
[64:46.27]That sounds alright.
[64:47.49]But let me go back to his eyes.
[64:48.49]Put him down.
[64:54.85]Can I make this a little bit bigger?
[64:57.17]I can.
[64:58.93]I don't want his eyes seen.
[65:00.43]I don't want you to be able to even see it.
[65:05.81]Okay, that's better.
[65:11.46]You can't see his eyes now.
[65:19.98]He's got a huge underbite.
[65:24.82]That works for me.
[65:33.35]Nigel Thornberry?
[65:43.51]Can I give him a pipe?
[65:44.47]This would make sense if he had a big pipe in his mouth.
[65:54.19]I think that's too extreme.
[65:55.17]What do you think?
[65:58.69]You just made another Family Guy character.
[66:00.50]No, I didn't.
[66:02.10]This is not a Family Guy character.
[66:03.56]This is not the guy from Family Guy.
[66:09.98]Oh, fuck me.
[66:11.18]That's horrible.
[66:13.56]Ugh.
[66:19.06]I don't want this guy in my house.
[66:22.71]Why does this guy remind me of a toothbrush?
[66:28.59]I don't want his eyes seen.
[66:30.34]What's that?
[66:55.36]This is the guy from Hellraiser.
[67:06.75]It is that guy with the braces.
[67:14.39]Can this be any bigger?
[67:24.45]He doesn't have eyes.
[67:29.91]Yes.
[67:31.34]What's that smell?
[67:40.76]Okay, that's good.
[67:41.60]This is Toucan Sam.
[67:44.00]You know, this could be Toucan Sam.
[67:46.86]But he's got the hair.
[67:47.52]The hair is perfect.
[67:48.18]I'm out moving the hair.
[67:54.59]I don't want to mess with the jaw.
[67:56.25]What about the mouth?
[67:56.81]The mouth could be a little bit smaller or bigger.
[68:06.18]No, that's too far.
[68:07.71]That's too far.
[68:08.33]It's going to detail mode.
[68:25.81]I can't... This mustache is so fucking gross now.
[68:43.00]He's got like a horn on his face.
[69:05.34]Okay, what about the cheek here?
[69:06.58]Oh, that's gonna stay out.
[69:07.73]Oh my fucking god.

[69:47.77]Thank you so much, Hawkeye of mine.
[69:55.04]Okay, what about, uh... These, all these could work.

[70:07.16]I don't know, it's gonna be tough.
[70:11.73]Ah!
[70:28.79]He's just a big Lebowski.
[70:33.99]But all fucked up.
[70:36.17]Oh, I don't know which one of these is better.
[70:38.21]He's a Muppet.

[70:40.69]Who's the Muppet that looks just like this?
[70:44.35]Which one of the Muppets?
[70:54.00]Jesus Christ.
[70:58.94]Janice!
[70:59.88]Janice from the Muppets.
[71:01.92]You've got it.
[71:08.85]It's a combination of the Swedish Chef and Janice from Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem.
[71:19.88]Oh, that's perfect.
[71:20.52]I don't want to touch him now.
[71:29.17]Oh my fucking god.
[71:32.34]He's perfect.
[71:38.68]This is the best character ever.
[71:39.72]I hope this guy doesn't get just murdered immediately because the stupid mod is turned on.
[71:45.53]I like... I already like this.
[71:50.37]What about bottoms?
[71:59.88]Keep him jacked.
[72:00.70]Oh, he's going to stay jacked.
[72:01.59]Don't worry.
[72:04.21]Bike riding shorts.
[72:05.09]What's this guy's aspirations?
[72:15.11]No, no, no, no.
[72:15.99]He's got to have... I like this.
[72:17.55]No, that's too tacky.
[72:19.21]That's way too much tack.
[72:22.25]Is this too much?
[72:22.79]Is the sweater too much?
[72:25.18]What do you think?
[72:29.94]Will Sims randomly just run up and kill somebody?
[72:31.76]They might.
[72:32.24]I don't know.
[72:32.60]This might be a waste of fucking time.
[72:34.54]I have the serial killer extreme violence mod on.
[72:37.12]I might just open up the house and they all might kill each other.
[72:40.63]And they all might die.
[72:41.53]So I don't know what to do.
[72:42.51]I don't know.
[72:47.49]Celebrity chef?
[72:49.37]We are... The whole house is already... There's gonna be like five people in this house.
[72:52.83]They're all gonna be chefs?
[72:56.42]I like that.
[72:57.44]Okay, what about formal?
[73:00.34]Looks pretty good to me, actually.
[73:01.50]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[73:02.66]Full body.
[73:03.12]That's way better.
[73:07.18]Yep.

[73:11.47]Absolutely.
[73:11.87]Alright, we got a full body athletic.
[73:22.18]Yep.
[73:24.02]Sleepwear.
[73:25.68]Towel.
[73:27.80]Uh, party mode.
[73:28.66]Oh, look at this guy.
[73:30.30]He's got so much style and so much flair.
[73:33.91]I wish I was this guy, you know what I mean?
[73:36.11]Look at the glasses.
[73:40.57]Swimwear.
[73:41.07]Uh, that looks... No, he needs something better than that.
[73:47.21]Do I have enough money for a pool?
[73:49.80]This is a Speedo kind of guy, for sure.
[73:54.38]This is a red Speedo kind of guy.
[74:03.80]Change the top here.
[74:09.52]That's so scary when he does that.
[74:10.84]Alright, look at his cards.
[74:11.64]The guy's a video game player.
[74:12.66]He's got a Space Invaders shirt.
[74:16.46]Yeah, he's the kind of weirdo that would wear a Christmas sweater.
[74:20.65]Alright, let's go with personality here.
[74:22.87]Hmm.
[74:24.11]Ha, each will say.
[74:28.18]Meshka Fromp, you messer.
[74:30.00]Low voice?
[74:30.85]Yeah, he's got probably a deep voice.
[74:33.03]Omiva, uh-huh.
[74:35.69]This guy doesn't look like a video gamer?
[74:36.91]What are you talking about?
[74:41.61]He's gonna have the jacked walk.
[74:43.73]This one.
[74:44.61]This, like, get-the-fuck-out-of-my-way walk, you know what I mean?
[74:50.14]Yeah, he's gonna have, like, the get-out-of-my-fucking-way Vince McMahon walk.
[74:54.30]Sooner, Pimep, sooner.
[74:57.44]Alright, aspirations.
[75:01.70]This guy's got to live forever.
[75:06.80]Bodybuilder?
[75:07.54]Should he be a bodybuilder for his aspirations?
[75:10.87]Love?
[75:13.53]Soulmate or serial romantic?
[75:19.37]Well, if we make him a serial romantic, he might start fucking killing people.
[75:24.95]I don't want this guy to be like a serial killer.
[75:31.27]Alright, he can have better relationships.
[75:34.69]Let's see here.
[75:35.63]Active.
[75:37.65]Energize.

[75:45.22]Turn off the mod.
[75:46.28]It'll be alright.
[75:49.98]These guys will be saved.
[75:50.74]Don't worry.
[75:52.28]Athletic.
[75:53.91]Romantic.
[75:54.39]If this guy hit on you at the bar, what would you do?
[76:02.06]Self-assured?
[76:03.84]He's really confident.
[76:05.42]Athletic.
[76:08.38]Or, should I make him cheerful?
[76:09.74]No, self-assured.
[76:16.39]Yeah, this guy means business.
[76:19.65]So, hello, my name is... I've got to get a good name here.

[81:17.47]I'm trying to make an authentic alien.
[81:19.07]Let's get in here.
[81:37.54]Let's tighten this up.
[81:49.00]Do I make like Worf or something?
[81:50.97]No.
[82:00.32]But it's the alien's disguise.
[82:02.08]So the alien's kind of disguised as another alien.
[82:08.23]Okay, that works.
[82:13.59]How about making the melted face lady?
[82:24.47]Looks pretty human to me.
[82:25.37]Yeah, we don't want to make this too fucked up.
[82:36.72]Old ladies don't dress like this though.
[82:39.26]Old ladies wear fucking like baggy clothes.
[82:44.51]I wish there was an arm length mod.
[82:56.78]There is.
[82:58.00]The worst part about this guys is so many of the mods are outdated.
[83:02.03]There were mods to make these people's arms.
[83:05.25]You know like Dead Space?
[83:06.21]The fucking monsters in Dead Space?
[83:07.86]You could make those.
[83:08.54]Okay, hair.
[83:15.20]But I've tried so many different ways that it's not compatible anymore.
[83:19.76]No matter what I do.
[83:20.84]I tried a thousand different things.
[83:27.55]What's an old lady?
[83:28.25]That's an old lady hairstyle.
[83:30.42]Oh, absolutely.
[83:31.02]That's like an old woman from the 60s, you know what I mean?
[83:35.52]Same with this one.
[83:36.73]That's even better.
[83:38.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[83:39.55]What do you think of an old lady haircut?
[83:51.74]No.
[83:53.50]No.
[83:54.24]Too modern.
[83:58.87]No, too nice.
[84:00.36]No, this one's nice too.
[84:03.58]No.
[84:06.00]No.
[84:10.24]I'm not doing that one.
[84:13.78]No.
[84:20.19]That's, that's, alright.
[84:25.67]That's okay too.
[84:32.50]Hold on, I'll find the perfect one here.
[84:45.65]None of these.
[84:46.95]I don't like any of these.
[84:48.63]That one's perfect.
[84:51.53]Got it.
[84:54.55]Looks like the grandma from The Sopranos.
[84:57.15]Well, that's perfect.
[84:57.95]Thanks for the compliment of my Sims character.
[85:13.94]Yeah, look, I need to make a list.
[85:21.49]She's gonna be like a snooty old bag, you know what I mean?
[85:23.93]Does that look like Judge Judy?
[85:35.29]Fucking angry eyebrows.
[85:45.39]Like furious.
[86:05.82]That's just a turtle.
[86:14.24]I like that though.
[86:16.89]That's very... Sticking my mouth out.
[86:19.39]Let's go to detail.
[86:26.53]I really want to change the eyebrows, though.
[86:30.57]Can't really do it from here.
[86:31.35]There we go.
[86:34.40]That looks alright.
[86:36.90]Can't get to the eyes from here, though.
[86:40.52]Fucking goggles are in the way.
[86:57.59]Pretty good disguise to be human.
[87:03.05]For the horde.
[87:03.79]Okay, let's take the back of the head.
[87:20.50]Well, that's a little too extreme.
[87:21.60]Let's pull it in.
[87:23.15]That's much better.
[87:30.16]Alright, I think that's good Just put on uh, I mean old lady clothes No, this is what's what's her name the Harry Potter lady that everybody didn't like the mean Harry Potter lady In a snowboarding outfit
[87:58.70]Oh, let's see here.
[87:59.56]What's very human-like?
[88:03.01]Look for something where you're trying so hard to be a human.
[88:21.96]Give her green hair?
[88:22.96]Well, she already has green hair here.
[88:32.32]Is there like a full body?
[88:33.24]Let's go full body.
[88:34.76]She looks like an ambassador to a cult here.
[88:40.99]Alright.
[88:42.59]No, no.
[88:43.55]Okay.
[88:55.56]Like a waiter?
[88:57.40]Like a Starbucks barista?
[89:01.72]Okay, we're gonna do coffee shop.
[89:06.40]She works at Starbucks.
[89:08.42]She's so into her job.
[89:10.88]She made her skin green.
[89:14.08]Okay.
[89:15.62]That works.
[89:18.44]Different shoes, though.
[89:21.81]Those are fine.
[89:22.75]Alright, so now let's take a look at the alien version.
[89:31.95]Now, if I change something here, will it change on her?
[89:33.97]I don't know.
[89:45.28]What happens if I do this?
[89:48.82]No, her disguise is different.
[90:02.83]He just looks kind of sloppy right here.
[90:04.43]Alright, how about... No, not everybody can be a fat guy.
[90:11.91]I gotta stop making everybody a fat person.
[90:13.84]You know what I mean?
[90:14.32]Like I just take the slider and I just go up with the whole thing.
[90:17.06]I do this every time.
[90:17.90]You know what I'm saying?
[90:34.50]This is like the huge upper body and tiny lower body.
[90:42.92]Big arms, broad shoulders.
[90:45.94]She's supposed to be like 100 years old.
[90:58.53]That's fine, I don't care.
[91:00.81]We'll make her have a funny mouth though, bigger ears.
[91:12.55]Me or cat?
[91:17.47]No, too much.
[91:20.16]No, pull it back.
[91:21.22]Pull it back, the whole head.
[91:22.36]Okay, hold on.
[91:32.68]Detail edit mode.
[91:33.50]Let's go in here.
[91:43.64]This is Yoda.
[92:00.52]Seriously, this person's fucking scary.
[92:02.46]This is actually scary.
[92:25.35]It's supposed to be an alien, guys, right?
[92:27.19]This is an alien.
[92:28.11]This is what an alien is going to look like in the future.
[92:32.17]When they finally land and they put a fucking syringe into your brain, they're going to look like this.
[92:47.23]Compared to the aliens now.
[92:49.77]Exactly.
[92:51.29]Now stop that.
[92:53.57]Stop pulling the whole head.
[93:01.37]I like this.
[93:01.81]This is fine.
[93:02.55]I can stay as is.
[93:07.63]Jar Jar Binks.
[93:08.29]Alright, what's an alien's personality?
[93:09.61]I'm gonna say, uh, location.
[93:15.05]City native.
[93:16.42]All about the city.
[93:17.18]Uh, deviance, probably?
[93:22.14]They're coming down here to, you know, probe everybody, right?
[93:29.36]Deviant, like, public enemy.
[93:33.68]Yeah, the Sim wants to make enemies and be a famous criminal.
[93:36.54]You're here to cause problems.
[93:42.15]And you also like, um, uh... Ooh, grungy!
[93:56.69]They don't speak English, what?
[94:09.95]No, I don't want to deal with that.
[94:11.07]I don't want to have a fucking just random outer space alien eating the food and farting and stuff.
[94:22.28]Vegetarian?
[94:23.10]No, they eat people.
[94:26.34]Evil.

[94:49.98]No, I don't want the old lady to be a bro.
[94:55.26]I don't fucking care.

[97:01.56]But, I mean, he... Hold on.

[98:04.16]Now his eyes are too big.
[98:06.32]There we go.
[98:06.64]Look at how handsome this guy is.
[98:07.84]This is Michael Jackson, essentially.
[98:09.30]We need to change that.
[98:10.76]Get rid of the Michael Jackson nose.
[98:13.48]Okay.
[98:13.94]Look at that guy.

[99:14.18]Okay?
[99:28.43]What does this voice sound like?

[101:48.38]He's like a Marvel character or something.
[101:52.21]What's his name?
[101:57.93]He's like a superhero character.
[101:59.73]Now take the hair away.
[102:02.61]You know who I'm talking about here?
[102:03.71]Who is this?
[102:04.25]This is going to drive me crazy.
[102:11.94]Not Spider-Man.
[102:18.12]okay that's fine like that so far no I like it all the way down like that Dr. Manhattan no it's not Dr. Manhattan
[102:56.59]I love it.
[102:58.93]I need to take away the facial hair for a second.
[103:10.32]The eyebrows.
[103:23.00]That's a South Park character.
[103:24.22]I'm making a guy from South Park.
[103:27.27]You know those old, stupid, shitty, make-your-own-South-Park avatars that existed back in, like, 2001?
[103:32.43]That's what I'm doing.
[103:43.05]I gotta get detail work here and go in the eyes.
[103:49.93]That's better.
[103:50.41]It looks like one giant eye.
[103:55.42]I'm making an emoji.
[103:58.48]This exists on your phone.
[104:00.32]Which one is this?
[104:04.62]Isn't that an emoji?
[104:16.55]Okay.
[104:18.10]The question is, I gotta do something with the nose.
[104:19.80]The nose has to be moved further in.
[104:24.02]Because it's getting in the way.
[104:25.20]This has to come down too.
[104:38.17]Oh my god.
[104:48.43]Up here, you think?
[104:49.51]Like right here, I think, is probably better.
[104:57.60]He's so sad.
[104:58.50]He should be.
[105:01.54]That looks good.
[105:02.10]Hold on here.
[105:15.31]His mouth is starting to droop.
[105:20.09]I think I can pull this all the way down.
[105:35.28]No, it's gonna come back up.
[105:44.37]There we go.
[105:47.69]Holy shit, I'm making a dog.
[105:55.62]It's just... Yeah, it's a Star Wars character.
[105:58.54]Okay, how about the mouth here now?
[106:15.31]This shouldn't be allowed.
[106:17.31]Can I move the eyes a little bit more?
[106:28.24]Yep.
[106:34.70]That nose has got to come all the way in, though.
[106:36.54]I don't like how it's sticking out.
[106:42.58]I mean, should I make this kind of like a wasp?
[106:46.78]I feel like this guy's a bee or something.
[106:48.48]I don't even know what this is.
[106:52.31]This is the fish guy that we talked about earlier.
[107:06.10]General Grievous.
[107:07.96]Oh my god, it really is.
[107:12.32]Baby General Grievous.
[107:24.14]but he's too big oh hold on that made it better that looks a lot better ruined no that's it's better that way
[108:04.16]Alright, I think the face is alright.
[108:05.71]Oh, fuck, his eyes need to be changed a little.
[108:07.27]I need to get in there and move those eyes.
[108:18.87]Now he looks really sad.
[108:19.91]Perfect.
[108:21.67]Oh my god.
[108:23.05]I feel so bad for this guy.
[108:31.74]Can't even look left and right.
[108:42.02]The music too.
[108:42.96]I don't think he needs that.
[108:55.65]No hair on this dude.
[108:57.03]It would look so out of place.
[109:08.10]Carrot top No, alright, it's not I'm just gonna we're gonna keep them like this a facial hair or anything No, that doesn't work just actually makes him look kind of more otherworldly doesn't it give him a neck beard Should we give him a neck beard?
[109:29.41]That looks weird
[109:37.29]Looks more like an animal now.
[109:46.86]No, no facial hair.
[109:49.20]Maybe I have, like, a baseball cap, though.
[109:55.34]I mean, that's kind of... Some of these are gonna be perfect.
[110:04.07]Some shitty cap.
[110:05.01]There is, like, a wasp outfit in there.
[110:14.80]That's kind of good.
[110:17.02]I'm okay with this one.
[110:18.08]But he needs to have, like, a little... baseball cap.
[110:24.38]He needs to be miserable.
[110:29.08]The sad and the hate is, uh... This works.
[110:33.60]No, none of them.
[110:34.38]Just take them.
[110:34.85]Just none.
[110:35.17]I think it's perfect.
[110:37.67]Give him a fedora.
[110:38.51]Oh, my fucking god.
[110:42.99]Okay, fine.
[110:55.03]No, none of this.
[110:55.87]I need to change his clothes, though.
[111:02.61]That's not it?
[111:08.12]That's not a fedora?
[111:10.80]Well, where's the fedora?
[111:12.00]Like, one of these?
[111:12.62]That's a bowler cap.
[111:19.69]Oh, there it is.
[111:28.74]No, what do you mean no?
[111:32.18]You want him to wear this?
[111:43.23]I like the other one better.
[111:44.19]I like the Walter White hat.
[111:53.74]It's his favorite TV show, guys.
[112:01.76]I mean, this is fitting, but no, he's not a Star Wars character.
[112:05.42]No, this is better.
[112:07.96]That's way better.
[112:10.12]He just looks like a little... I got my funny cartoon hat on.
[112:14.24]Okay.
[112:17.94]So, he's good.
[112:18.86]Let's give him... Where's, like, the sad walk?
[112:24.92]Where is it?
[112:25.26]There it is.
[112:27.96]Sleepy walk.
[112:34.14]Okay.
[112:37.85]It's alright.
[112:43.01]That sounds really defeated.
[112:44.45]Oh.
[112:45.59]Okay, where did Sleepy walk?
[112:49.91]Okay, roommate, roommate, roommate, roommate.
[112:54.34]There we go.
[112:55.28]So he wants... It says motivation.
[113:05.26]Make him the brother of the alien?
[113:12.77]What?
[113:13.55]Sister?
[113:16.49]Oh, wife.
[113:18.77]Sister of the alien?
[113:24.83]Wait, hold on.
[113:26.41]No, no, that's what they are to you.
[113:32.03]I guess we could just be... It's my sister.
[113:35.11]The alien is the sister.
[113:39.37]No, let them work it out, right?
[113:41.19]Like, if they want to be sister and brother, then they can... No, that's not how it works, but you know what I mean.
[113:45.14]Like, don't The Sims just do their own thing?
[113:47.12]Oh.
[113:51.76]Alright, he wants to be popular.
[113:55.82]Party animal.
[113:57.26]Joke star.
[113:58.10]Friend of the world.
[113:59.00]The Sim wants to make and keep as many friends as they can.
[114:04.35]And we're going to go with Gloomy.
[114:08.77]So Gloomy is sad, can share melancholy thoughts to other Sims, and while sad, gain a boost to their creative skill.
[114:17.53]We're also going to do... I thought I could do it twice.
[114:23.72]Bookworm.
[114:26.26]Geek.
[114:28.86]Lazy.
[114:31.64]A snob, I would say.
[114:33.98]Snob, right?
[114:36.64]You think, like, nothing is good enough for you.
[114:40.00]You know what I mean?
[114:43.91]And a dance machine.
[114:44.95]That's the saddest dance I've ever seen.
[114:51.39]I kind of want that because... Clumsy.
[114:55.53]Yep.
[114:57.58]Sad, snob, clumsy.
[114:59.24]Put them together.
[115:06.24]Look at that thumbnail.
[115:07.50]Can you zoom in on that and look at how it's just... bad?
[115:10.83]I don't know.
[115:11.83]The iPhone was taking a picture of me.

[172:02.00]Yeah, he did, didn't he?
[172:13.77]I swear to God, man.
[172:18.44]That's some of the funniest shit I've fucking ever seen in a game.
[172:21.74]It's just so out of place.
[172:22.83]And now this whole thing is ruined.
[172:25.17]Are they actually like gone forever though?
[172:27.27]Are they gone actually gone?
[172:30.87]Is this the only character that we can play with?
[172:40.80]They can come back as ghosts.
[172:44.00]Okay, hold on.
[172:48.20]Let me go to like... I didn't save the game.
[172:51.02]So what if I go back to the main menu?
[172:52.42]Oh, I did save the household already.
[173:00.49]Okay.
[173:01.81]But I mean, part of me is almost kind of happy that happened because now I should probably move into a different house.
[173:05.81]You know what I'm saying?
[173:16.45]I feel like I can actually play the game now.
[173:22.71]Chuck is an active sim.

[173:28.53]Put the gun down, man.

[206:29.94]So we need a family to move in.
[206:36.69]I need a household.
[206:43.75]No, where's my household?
[206:52.56]I'm going to go to the gallery.
[206:57.71]You cannot do this while a Sim is dying.
[207:00.39]I think it's time to move away from the desert.
[207:15.56]What do you guys think?
[207:17.84]Somebody's dying.
[207:18.60]Who's dying?

[211:14.33]And I just, I hurt myself.

[211:44.80]I really don't know why I'm doing all this.
[211:46.16]Alright, that's fine.

[217:13.97]Kill Code, thank you so much for the $50, man.
[217:18.08]Press Ctrl Shift C to open the cheat menu and then put in Motherload to give yourself enough funds to build whatever you want.
[217:24.79]Also, I literally fell out of my chair laughing at the second gunshot.
[217:27.95]And I expect full you to pay the bill for my cracked skull.
[217:31.63]Just kidding.
[217:36.04]Do I start cheating?
[217:37.28]People are going to be mad at me if I cheat.
[217:39.46]I need to undo this because I fucked it all up.

[218:59.60]Can anyone even fit in this thing?
[219:04.86]Let's do another two beds up here.
[219:07.03]Look, no one's going to be asleep at the same time anyways.
[219:10.31]I'll make sure half of them are on night schedules and half are on day schedules.
[219:13.45]Easy.
[219:23.08]These rooms are small.
[219:28.16]This isn't RimWorld?
[219:29.89]What do you mean?
[219:31.17]I need another double bed.
[219:36.22]Look, this is temporary.
[219:37.84]Don't worry.

[248:14.34]He has to pee.
[248:16.50]And he wants to do some social.
[248:18.06]This is too much to manage.
[248:20.30]And then take a bubble bath so you feel better about the world.
[248:22.56]You know what I mean?
[248:25.91]What time is your appointment here?
[248:27.35]6 a.m.

[248:31.65]Anything you need for this?
[248:34.25]Ideal mood is inspired.
[248:35.52]How do I get him inspired?
[248:37.72]Play in the rain.
[248:43.12]That should inspire him a little bit after his bubble bath.
[248:52.91]Pull.
[248:53.21]Do a kill pull.
[248:53.95]Pull.
[248:54.29]Pull.
[248:54.61]Pull.

[249:02.58]Somebody has to die.
[249:20.33]Okay.

[249:26.43]I don't even remember these people's names.
[249:31.12]We've got Fru-Fru.
[249:34.24]We'll go through.
[249:34.72]Fru-Fru is the guy currently in the bath.
[249:36.30]This guy right here.
[249:39.30]Schnozwell is obviously Schnozwell, you know.

[249:52.99]Garrett Thompson.
[249:58.80]We got Sandler.
[250:02.80]We got Jerma.

[250:20.65]Please vote on this.
[250:24.59]We need to make some room.
[250:27.46]You can't have seven people in this goddamn house.
[250:35.19]There you go.
[250:40.85]Really?
[250:44.30]Really?
[250:50.41]I'm not even going to say anything because I don't want to influence a vote.
[250:53.47]Can we kill more than one?
[250:54.73]We'll see what it's like after one of them is gone.
[250:57.61]And then we'll see if we need to continue to drop people.
[251:05.32]We'll take a look.
[251:12.18]It looks pretty good so far.
[251:20.75]I'm not going to kill the least voted person.
[251:22.95]That defeats the whole purpose of the poll.
[251:26.03]Well, it's still pretty close between me and Sandler, but it looks like Sandler's pretty high up there.
[251:36.52]I'm going to give this another few seconds.
[251:39.72]If you haven't voted, please do.
[251:47.04]In ten nine eight seven six five four three two one The sandler has been voted off the island.
[252:00.45]Thank you for voting Appreciate it He's gone So here's how we're gonna do this, where is he I
[252:27.01]Is there like a neighbor's house he can go to?
[252:29.88]He's gonna go to the neighbor's house.
[252:31.78]And he's gonna kill himself in their house.
[252:35.92]I'm gonna go visit Johnny Zest.
[252:40.31]No, I don't want to invite anybody.
[252:54.44]This is what you guys asked for.
[253:08.65]No, I can't.
[253:11.56]He's happy.
[253:24.13]Just the guy.
[253:25.35]This is the guy that started it all.
[253:26.93]This is Satan.
[253:27.71]This is the antichrist right here, guys.
[253:29.39]Do you understand?
[253:34.16]Look, here's what I'm going to do.
[253:38.49]We're going to enable... We're going to enable killing.
[253:44.29]I can't even put me on there.
[253:48.02]I didn't want to do it.
[253:48.76]I didn't want to see it.
[253:59.67]Enable autonomous killing for this sim.
[254:06.04]Like this, right?
[254:09.50]So if I do options, enable autonomous killing for this Sim.
[254:20.01]So that means that he's going to die.
[254:21.07]That on himself.
[254:21.79]Alright, we're having fun.
[254:23.37]He's making friends.

[254:53.65]This is so awkward.
[254:55.83]Why is there water?
[254:58.67]Why does he have a gun?
[255:00.37]Why does he have a gun?
[255:01.91]Is there a reason why he just showed a gun?
[255:04.18]Oh no.

[275:08.18]That's stupid.
[275:08.80]You suck.
[275:09.28]I'm going to cry in the closet.
[275:10.68]Come on.
[275:10.88]What about this thing?
[275:11.38]I'm a clown this time.
[275:13.04]Is this what you guys want?
[275:22.99]Funny, right?
[275:24.15]Did you think it was funny?
[275:28.29]Okay, now I have to be mean to renegades.
[275:31.86]Who's a renegade?
[275:36.96]That's it.
[275:38.04]That's it.
[275:39.24]What did I get?
[275:42.12]I don't know.
[275:46.00]What happened here?
[275:49.95]He's just crying.
[275:54.87]Plan outfit.
[275:56.03]I don't want a plan outfit.
[276:04.34]Alright, where are the renegades?
[276:06.40]I'm going to be mean to them, but they don't exist.
[276:10.42]Drink a coffee.
[276:11.13]Let's go drink.

[276:16.59]I'm going to make a cafe latte.
[276:25.98]Why the face is so fucked up?
[276:27.36]Okay.
[276:29.05]It's funny you say that.
[276:30.41]Because I have a mod that has randomly generated fucked up faces for everybody.
[276:41.68]Am I drinking my coffee?
[276:52.49]Anybody want one?
[277:00.04]Okay, so I got that.
[277:01.64]I have to be mean to the renegades.
[277:02.95]189 club points.
[277:08.11]Is this too much cream?

[277:47.50]Hey, what's up, man?
[277:49.86]What?
[277:55.95]Oh, Renegade.
[277:56.55]I'm a Renegade.
[277:57.25]I think I'm so smart.
[277:58.17]Give fake news.
[277:59.25]No, I'm going to debate game strategy with him.
[278:04.04]Kill.
[278:04.26]No, I can't kill anybody.
[278:07.06]I mean, I could put a piece of dynamite on him.
[278:09.64]Hi.
[278:26.69]Look around.
[278:32.17]Okay, this is non-deadly interactions.
[278:35.81]I'm just gonna beat him up.
[278:42.56]Right?
[278:42.90]I have to, like, I have to beat up the other, the other team.
[278:50.68]He's gonna be fine.
[278:51.49]Just to get out of our, get off the Paragon turf, right?
[278:59.08]This is too much.
[279:02.00]I don't want to do this much damage.
[279:05.82]I don't want to just push him or something.
[279:08.64]Alright.
[279:09.12]Okay.
[279:09.62]That's good.
[279:10.60]That's good.
[279:11.10]It's still going.
[279:13.42]Holy shit.
[279:14.30]Look at his face.
[279:22.67]I'm sorry about that.
[279:23.71]I didn't mean to.
[279:28.08]Alright, I did what I was supposed to do.
[279:29.06]Is that what you guys wanted?
[279:36.22]All my friends are gone.
[279:39.16]No, no, they're up there.
[279:47.51]No.
[279:48.75]Let's fake news it up.
[279:52.19]Alright, I'm going home.
[279:53.93]Let's go.
[279:56.61]Go home.
[280:00.07]He's no longer sad, he's just confident.
[280:02.35]Yeah, he kicked somebody's ass and now he's confident.
[280:04.29]He's still a little mopey though.
[280:14.55]Your fitted shirt smells like colored pencils.
[280:16.59]Is there a reason why I know exactly what that means?
[280:24.40]I know what a colored pencil smells like.
[280:26.42]That's weird.
[280:27.67]Why is it... Why?
[280:28.47]That's weird, man.
[280:29.47]Alright, play in the rain, right?
[280:34.05]Buy an umbrella, practice speaking in the mirror.
[280:37.41]Oh, wait, I have work to go to.

[281:43.32]She needs to take a bath.

[284:40.21]Okay, cool.
[284:41.37]I'll take that.
[284:41.83]Uh, he didn't have it anymore.
[284:50.36]Who's the antisocial one?
[284:54.74]Alright, I think... I think I'm gonna take a break.
[284:58.84]We could go for about five hours now.
[285:01.34]We'll... We will catch back up with our sim hosts.
[285:06.95]It's getting to be about midnight, so.
[285:11.73]We'll be live tomorrow.
[285:15.47]I'm going to save the game.
[285:16.92]I'm, like, into this right now.
[285:18.16]I want to do this.
[285:19.92]So I was going to do a music thing tomorrow, but I think I'm going to postpone that until another couple days from now because I'm having, like, a good time doing this.
[285:27.80]This is, like, a lot of fun.
[285:30.03]So we'll do the same thing tomorrow.
[285:32.88]I'm gonna get some more mods.
[285:34.46]We're not just gonna do the, like, shoot, stab, kill mod.
[285:36.98]I'll get a few more.
[285:38.75]And see how much other, like, weird shit we can do.
[285:45.23]So, I will see you guys tomorrow, same time.
[285:50.47]Go get pets.
[285:52.20]I'll get some more shit.
[285:55.50]This was a lot of fun.
[285:57.56]I feel like it deserves two streams.
[285:59.98]So, at least.
[286:04.54]So with that, we're going to go to the credits.
[286:06.20]Thank you for watching.
[286:07.32]I'll see you tomorrow if you're going to come and hang out and watch more weird shit on The Sims.
[286:15.13]I will save it on stream so you know that it's actually going to happen.
[286:20.69]The current save is going to be called... Sandler is gone.
[286:32.48]And then back up the save file.
[286:36.45]Anyways, take care guys.
[286:37.79]Let's head to the credits now.
[286:43.05]I mean, before we do that, another $50 from Golden Cricket.
[286:47.23]Golden Cricket has more than $100 tonight.
[286:52.15]Thank you so much, man.
[286:53.41]Golden Cricket, here's a nice Sims house break.
[286:56.27]Also, your alien woman is far too sexual with those moans.
[287:04.31]Aye, aye, aye.
[287:06.76]johnny zest died but at what cost that my back hurts my chest hurts my head everything hurts I wouldn't trade it though for anything that was some of the funniest I've ever seen in a game that's not supposed to have that stuff happen the crazy thing is there are probably people that came to the stream that's never have never really played The Sims imagine if you've never seen The Sims 4.
[287:33.77]Those are very detailed, high quality animations.
[287:36.61]That's not some shitty mod.
[287:47.37]But, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[287:48.95]And thank you Golden Cricket again.

[292:11.06]Many various biaz, men of glue, and rats would dine at our fine establishment.
[292:14.70]It was all going well until we locked in the walk-in freezer.

[295:50.04]Thank you, Squirds, for the $10.50.
[295:50.84]$10 here.
[295:54.47]Hey Jeremy, just want to thank you for being my favorite comedian and entertainer out there.
[295:58.37]No joke.
[295:59.75]You are a genius and I want to thank you for all the laughs you've given me.
[296:02.75]You've been a huge help as I'm currently going through alcohol problems.
[296:05.78]Borderline alcoholic.
[296:06.86]I don't know if you have any advice for me, but I find it very hard to find motivation to get myself to do anything to better myself or my life.
[296:13.40]English is not my first language.
[296:15.92]I love you, man.
[296:16.40]Keep it going.
[296:20.62]I'll tell you a quick little story about...
[296:25.48]Well, though, not necessarily... My father told me this.
[296:31.42]I hold my father to pretty well regard and respect.
[296:35.50]Sometimes he told me, you need to think about other... If you can't stop doing something, right?
[296:44.84]He made a point that if you can't stop...
[296:49.47]think of some other people that you might be affecting, right?
[296:54.23]My father was an avid smoker for like 40 years, 30 years, something like that.
[296:58.05]He smoked forever.
[296:59.67]And it took my sister, my sister was gonna have a baby.
[297:06.98]And he was just like, I, he would always, he did a bunch of, you know, tried all everything and nothing worked.
[297:15.52]And the second my sister was like, I'm having a baby.
[297:18.69]It's just like, I'm done.
[297:20.83]You know what I mean?
[297:22.19]Like, it's over.
[297:23.41]I'm not smoking anymore.
[297:25.75]So sometimes there has to be like a catalyst.
[297:32.46]I have a sister and a nephew?
[297:33.44]Like, oh yeah.
[297:37.50]But if you can't... If you yourself are having problems with that, try to think about some other people who you might be able to...
[297:49.68]You know, if you're affecting somebody else, maybe think about, oh, if I stopped, maybe that would, maybe they would be, maybe making them happy about the shit that I have to do is better than if you can't do it yourself.
[298:02.52]And that's only if you're having trouble doing it on your own.
[298:05.60]Also, on top of that, the resources that are available to you for addiction, I would absolutely implore you to get in contact with them.
[298:19.20]Because if that doesn't work, if you're still having trouble, you got to contact one of those places and start to turn it around.
[298:30.08]The hardest thing to do is just to do the first part.
[298:37.10]You know, it's hard to just do the first step to be like, alright, I'm done.
[298:41.51]I'm going to do it now.
[298:42.53]I'm going to do it now and I'm going to get help now.
[298:44.05]It's hard.
[298:48.34]For some people they need like a like almost like an oh shit And then Jerma sister gave birth to Burgah Boy Hardest is sticking with it for the rest of your life Yeah, I mean it's it's a constant battle it's a constant struggle and
[299:21.83]It's not as easy as just, oh, it's over now.
[299:24.55]Some people are capable of doing that, and obviously, I've been talking about, like, cigarettes, and that's a little different.
[299:31.46]But the point is still there, right?
[299:38.68]Just take care of yourself.
[299:40.68]And also think about this, too.
[299:41.74]Here's another thing, right?
[299:44.76]You got that one body.
[299:51.16]We're all around for a certain amount of time.
[299:54.19]And you got just... That's it.
[299:56.13]You got one body.
[300:06.90]Try to take care of it.
[300:11.06]Oh, wow.
[300:11.70]He's so woke.
[300:13.44]You got a body.
[300:17.58]I really hope that you can figure that out, squirts.
[300:22.67]Because that shit is not easy.
[300:25.03]Because once you get addicted to something, it's almost impossible to stop.
[300:35.31]I wish you the best of luck.
[300:36.19]Please check out some of the resources that are available to you.
[300:40.55]And the advice that I give is not speaking from any professional advice, right?
[300:47.56]And I want to make sure that's really clear too, is I can only help or give you certain things that I think would help, right?
[300:55.36]But I am not equipped as a professional.
[300:58.26]I'm not somebody that, oh, he said that, so that's law.
[301:01.61]You got to remember, I'm just a guy with an opinion, right?
[301:11.32]A guy.
[301:11.98]Just a guy.
[301:14.06]But seriously, take care of yourself, man.
[301:15.22]I hope you figure it out.
[301:16.98]Keep fighting.
[301:20.87]And do what you can.
[301:27.37]All you can do is do what you can.
[301:28.85]And try.
[301:29.15]But thank you so much for the $10.
[301:33.76]Take care of yourself, squirts.
[301:35.20]Thank you.
[301:38.14]Thank you, Beebeard, for the two dollars.
[301:39.59]Thanks for this fantastic character creation, Jeremy.
[301:41.55]You just turned my day around.
[301:43.35]Thank you for being here, Beebeard.
[301:45.95]Much love to you.
[301:46.47]Thank you.
[301:49.09]T-T-O-K, T-T-O-K.
[301:50.77]Thanks for the two bucks.
[301:51.67]Mr. Bread.
[301:53.61]The newest horror creation from the twisted mind of Junji.
[301:57.77]Junji Ito.
[302:07.09]Oh, poop.
[302:07.51]Did you miss The Sims 4 gameplay?
[302:08.79]You did.
[302:11.51]You did, but don't worry.
[302:12.21]We're going to play it again tomorrow.
[302:14.06]Same time, same place.
[302:18.10]But thank you, Tio.
[302:20.18]Double D11.
[302:21.58]Doubled 11.
[302:22.14]Thanks for the $1.
[302:22.81]Hey, Jerma.
[302:23.11]This is my first time donating as I got money in my bank account.
[302:26.13]Just wanted to ask you what the scariest moment of your life was.
[302:29.51]Mine was when I first got my job in a bakery department in a grocery store.
[302:33.19]I tried cutting a bread loaf, but cut my finger up.
[302:36.49]Bad.
[302:36.81]I was in so much pain that I ended up rolling into the walk-in oven.
[302:41.77]Thank you, Byte, for the one dollar.
[302:43.28]Hey, it's been a while since I donated.
[302:44.86]Can't wait to see these characters in the ring in the next Jerma Rumple.
[302:47.76]My money's on Mr. Bread.
[302:50.76]Yeah, like I said, guys, guaranteed at least two of these people will be there.
[302:55.13]That's coming up soon.
[302:56.05]We're at that point where the amount of new characters and new people from games... There's enough of them now to make another one.
[303:06.50]Always have to have at least 10 to 15 newcomers, right?
[303:10.74]Getting to that point now where that's becoming a reality.
[303:17.47]Yeah.
[303:19.29]Thank you so much, Byte.
[303:21.36]Thank you, DragonBreath75 for the $1.
[303:23.44]I think of all the new emotes, jermaChomp is my favorite.
[303:26.58]Make sure that in Rat Movie 3, there is a rat that doesn't talk and just screeches every time he says something.
[303:35.33]That's a great emote.
[303:38.19]HawkeyeOfMind, we'll touch upon it again.
[303:39.79]$50 from HawkeyeOfMind, thank you so much.
[303:43.52]And he says, Jerma, I beg of you, my stomach hurts from laughing.
[303:48.02]Yeah, there was a part there where I really thought I was gonna pass out.
[303:55.44]I was fucking dying on camera.
[304:05.77]God, what a great mod.
[304:08.11]What an absolutely fucking insane mod.
[304:12.93]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[304:15.07]I've nearly choked twice since the stream started.
[304:20.12]Darkstar, again, thanks for the $1.
[304:21.58]This is by far the worst band of adventurers I've ever seen in a D&D campaign.
[304:29.26]Hey, Megamoob, thanks for the $5, Megamoob.
[304:32.87]Gotta put Schnauzwell for Jerma Rumble.
[304:35.21]Oh yeah, don't worry, he'll be there.
[304:37.61]Jake games thanks for the one dollar oh I haven't laughed this hard since the movie streams I'm gonna pass out I I need I wanted to see it I have to see it oh this is oh this is this is the dance
[305:05.47]That's fucking unbelievable.
[305:07.79]Un-fucking-believable!
[305:11.02]He didn't even do anything, and the guy's face is gone.
[305:16.52]I love this game.
[305:19.60]EA, you got a lot of fucking problems, but thank god this game is fucking hilarious.
[305:24.42]And other people have made so much content for it that makes it worth playing.
[305:32.31]But thank you, Jake Games.
[305:34.41]Thank you SmolVolt for the $2.80.
[305:37.08]He says, you smell?
[305:38.58]I took a shower before the stream.
[305:41.00]I'm good.
[305:48.06]Snort part two.
[305:56.36]What the fuck?
[305:59.52]You smell good.
[306:00.25]Hey, thanks.
[306:02.07]Reptoy, thanks for the $5.
[306:03.55]Why did you give the alien giant breasts?
[306:06.47]No, I did not.
[306:07.51]See, if you caught the character creation portion of the stream, that alien is an old lady.
[306:15.60]A very old woman.
[306:17.42]And I was trying to make the realistic approach of having the old lady... Old lady has the two members there.
[306:24.66]They drop and they're heavy.
[306:26.40]I wasn't making them... That's not the intention.
[306:29.00]It was old lady boobs.
[306:31.06]And I said it.
[306:31.58]I did.
[306:32.68]That's all I'm going to say.
[306:33.64]And if you caught the character creation portion, you'd have seen and we've talked about it.
[306:40.10]I'm making it worse.
[306:40.78]It's okay.
[306:41.52]Don't worry.
[306:42.03]We're going to move on.
[306:42.61]Thank you, Reptory, for the $5.
[306:43.69]Thank you, Endwell, for the $1.34.
[306:44.65]Make Beanbag Sonic.
[306:52.74]If I could have the Long Arms mod, I would.
[306:55.86]And I'm going to keep looking, by the way, before tomorrow.
[306:58.60]I'm going to try to get the crazy Dark Souls monster creator.
[307:03.56]Which is not compatible anymore.
[307:05.60]It hasn't been updated in like two years.
[307:08.16]With all the patches the game has had.
[307:10.00]And I got the game on Origin.
[307:11.80]You can't roll it back, I don't think.
[307:15.48]But thank you, dude.
[307:16.18]Thank you, Andoxin, for the $1.00.
[307:19.19]uh hey Jerma it's me the surgery guy again it's been a week since my surgery and I'm back home on my bed thanks for the entertaining stream and the upstairs mentality bit help me through some of the not so nice nurses love you man and keep being the amazing inspirational thoughtful caring loving and absolutely wonderful person that you are I probably will be resting when you read this but I hope I can find it through I hope I can find it through the long bit read

[308:06.87]Take care, Endoxin.
[308:11.53]Thank you to Shootman for the $1.
[308:13.38]Shootman2 just wanted to say that I love your streams and you've inspired me to do my own.
[308:16.74]I love the idea that you can just be yourself without putting on a face, and people will come to you if you are genuine.
[308:23.80]It's been really fun for me and I've met a lot of great people.
[308:25.73]Here's a short video I made from one of your older streams.
[308:29.77]You don't need to watch it if you don't want to.
[308:33.85]Oh.
[308:49.57]You know, the funny thing is saying in the quotes and the brackets, you don't need to watch this if you don't want to.
[308:56.79]I gotta copy and paste these videos so I can have it just always on the screen so I can know.
[309:01.91]Look at that YouTube link.
[309:03.03]That's the one.
[309:03.53]That's the gnome guy.
[309:06.35]Thank you, Shootman, for the $1.
[309:07.39]Appreciate it.
[309:07.83]And good luck on Twitch.

[309:19.98]Thank you, Wonderful Telephone, for the $5.
[309:21.26]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[309:24.56]Hey, Girma.
[309:25.28]Hey, Gir- You fucked me all up.
[309:29.59]Hey, Garf's working on a big project for you.
[309:33.31]So we all can have our favorite Girma memes and characters.
[309:36.19]So which one would you have a hard time getting rid of?
[309:38.63]Now for the moment of truth.
[309:39.57]Who's your favorite stream and meme character?
[309:43.05]I need you to answer truthfully.
[309:45.89]You'd be the role of Spider-Man.
[309:49.21]He's got to be a young fan fave like Spidey.
[309:56.43]You're not going to do an Infinity War thing, are you?
[309:59.29]Alright, my favorite character is Thanos.
[310:01.87]That's my favorite character.
[310:03.57]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, and here's your poster.
[310:10.63]Upcoming Infinity War.
[310:13.34]Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the Jermaverse, but this is my putting a smile on my face.
[310:21.45]Your favorite character is Thanos?
[310:22.43]It is.
[310:23.07]My favorite, like, current Marvel character is Thanos.
[310:30.08]Oh, people just keep making new URL vids.
[310:32.00]Whatever.
[310:36.90]What about Deadpool?
[310:37.66]Deadpool's cool.
[310:42.73]No, I don't want to delete the population.
[310:44.71]I just think he's a great character.
[310:47.23]He was very well written in that movie.
[310:54.61]Josh Brolin did a great job.
[311:07.98]Do I have any expectations for Avengers 4?
[311:09.82]I hope Thanos is in it!
[311:14.36]I hope he's in it!
[311:15.54]I hope he's in the movie!
[311:20.07]He's my favorite character!
[311:27.83]I don't know.
[311:30.29]I can't talk about Infinity War.
[311:31.35]I already got in trouble for that.
[311:37.29]But thank you, Garfield.
[311:39.21]Looking forward to your project.
[311:40.31]Thank you.
[311:40.67]Bake me home for the $5.
[311:41.84]Schnozwell for Jerma Rumble or Riot.

[311:51.41]Thank you, Bake Me Home, for the $5.
[311:54.08]Thank you, Doubled11, for the $2.

[312:18.07]Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for the $1.
[312:20.09]Jeremy, stop.
[312:20.69]I'm crying.
[312:21.31]I nearly threw up.
[312:28.66]I'm sorry that you had some stomach issues during that part of the stream, but thank you, Dinosaurus Rex.
[312:32.50]Thank you.

[312:43.76]Hope the move to Vegas goes well.
[312:47.95]Thank you for your insanely kind words.
[312:50.17]I... I don't know what to say.
[312:55.07]Thank you.
[312:55.85]That means a lot.
[313:00.30]Thank you, Double D. I keep calling you Double D. I know I do.
[313:05.84]But thank you.
[313:08.08]You're welcome.
[313:08.52]Thank you, man.
[313:10.66]Butter Derp, thanks for the $1.
[313:11.96]Hello, Jeremy.
[313:12.50]I've been meaning to donate and now I can.
[313:15.36]I love you, man.
[313:15.96]I've been watching you for four years now, and it's no mistake that nearly every person in the Discord is fun to talk to.
[313:22.53]Your personality, comedic ability, timing, and method, and your acting skills have gathered a community of diverse yet like-minded people that I can always jump in and talk to.
[313:31.03]He says, you did that.
[313:34.79]Or, um, or you did, right?
[313:40.05]You guys did that.
[313:45.42]And there's a lot to be said for the people that hang out here.
[313:52.22]And people that are part of this bigger kind of viewing community.
[313:57.63]Like, you guys did that.
[314:05.29]If I can be a thing that a bunch of you guys can relate to and hang out and
[314:12.80]be the connection to make friends and stuff.
[314:14.34]That's fucking awesome.
[314:15.26]I'm so happy to hear that.
[314:22.25]But thank you, Butterderp, for watching for as long as you have, and for your very, very, very nice things you've said.
[314:35.12]Much love to you.
[314:35.62]Take care, man.
[314:37.36]And then Butterderp, again!
[314:40.79]you and only you you may have had awesome viewers who helped but they were only there because of your aforementioned qualities going off to college in two weeks and I'm very worried that nobody there will know you that's the great and horrible thing about you you're so entertaining and funny and that simply enjoying your content is a sign of compatible friendship that's the great thing the horrible thing is that we as a community are so exclusive
[315:07.76]And it's very tough to find somebody like that.
[315:09.54]But if the community grows too much, then I'm afraid of chats being ruined.
[315:13.63]You're the perfect combination of funny without being overrun by dummy.
[315:18.69]Your interaction with chat leads to a reason to watch live.
[315:22.39]Not many people care for chat like you do.
[315:24.79]Then there's that indescribable quality about you.
[315:27.41]The reason why every word you speak puts a smile on my face.
[315:30.13]And that's not an easy task.
[315:33.83]The reason so many people in chat...
[315:36.64]fuck with you simply for your reaction which people actually want to see the reason why things that you say are uniquely funny when you and only you say them maybe it's the absolute the hysterical way you respond to people talking about your bulge maybe it's the way you aren't like every other comic who just goes haha I'm stupid there's more if you could please take a look at this well butter derp
[316:06.27]Let me just first of all respond to that.
[316:11.99]And say... Um... I think... Haha, I'm stupid if I just said that.
[316:23.58]No, I think, um...
[316:28.23]Well, but you'd be talking about... First of all, you're talking about the thing about growing.
[316:32.29]Right?
[316:33.35]And, oh no, if you grow, then you might get worse.
[316:38.17]But let's think about the channel growth so far.
[316:41.29]Right?
[316:44.54]This channel has grown a lot in the last year and a half.
[316:47.70]We've doubled in viewership over the last two years.
[316:51.90]And I feel like it's still... People are still... Everyone still has fun.
[317:00.57]Of course, I don't know if... I can't tell you that, oh yeah, in another year or two, we have 10,000 concurrent viewers.
[317:10.24]You can't make those kind of predictions.
[317:13.38]I'm just, whatever happens, happens.
[317:16.26]I'm just going to do the best that I fucking can.
[317:18.54]I'm going to do as much as I can.
[317:21.02]And I'm going to make every stream that I... I want to make it as good as I fucking can.
[317:26.42]And that's all that I'm going to do.
[317:29.38]And I think that if people want to hang out here, then I'm glad you're here.
[317:38.31]But you've said a ton of things that are just, I can't even respond because they're so unbelievably nice.
[317:56.64]You have a lot of other stuff written here.
[318:00.10]I'm not sure if you want me to read this on stream or anything.
[318:04.37]What the fuck?
[318:09.13]Oh, okay.
[318:10.09]That just scared the shit out of me.
[318:11.45]That was just the... That's a trailer for the serial killer mod that I have.
[318:21.18]I have it still open here for some reason.
[318:24.88]Sandler But I will read that off stream.
[318:28.33]I think I would rather read that off stream and take it in But butter derp just know Regardless of chat changing or more people that I'm going to just keep doing the things that I've been doing for a
[318:41.88]seven years I haven't changed my formula I haven't changed how I approach doing any of these things I'm going to try to do things at the best of my possible ability and I'm going to try to make things fun that's it that's all I'm going to do those two things have been what I've been wanting to do for seven years straight and I haven't stopped doing it so why would I stop doing it like that now
[319:12.42]he's old material no no I'm not talking about like like formula as in how I approach streaming and making youtube videos not I'm gonna I'm stupid that's you saying right drinking baby formula that's good for your bones that's fine but thank you so much butter derp way too many things in there require way more praise from from me to you
[319:42.97]But for the purposes of moving the stream forward, I just have to say thank you so much, dude, for real.
[319:49.41]Eves, thanks for the $1.
[319:50.33]Jerma, I wanted to ask you if there were any games you're looking forward to in this upcoming year or any games you've been wanting to stream.
[319:58.52]Also, let me turn the music down.
[320:02.20]Also, hi to you.
[320:04.52]Hi.
[320:04.92]Thank you.
[320:05.48]Or hail to you.
[320:06.32]Thank you.
[320:06.62]I just got bit by a fucking bug on my back.
[320:10.89]Hitman 2.
[320:12.47]Hitman was my game of the year when it came out.
[320:15.69]I loved that, especially the direction they took the new one.
[320:23.50]I cannot wait to play Hitman 2.
[320:28.84]Sekiro, the new FromSoftware game, looks insane.
[320:32.69]Looks absolutely fucking fantastic.
[320:35.23]That as well.
[320:38.26]Hitman 2 looks exactly the same as 1.
[320:40.08]That's a good thing.
[320:42.40]Hitman 1 was so good.
[320:43.84]It was so detailed and funny and interesting.
[320:46.94]I'm okay with 6 more detailed missions.
[320:53.90]But anyways, thank you, dude.
[320:55.06]Thank you, The Reaper of Memes for the $1.

[321:16.67]Jerma, I've been watching you since you had a few thousand subs on YouTube.
[321:21.42]Just want to say thank you for all the ways you've helped impact my life.
[321:25.18]You are a hero in my eyes.
[321:31.46]I'm glad to be.
[321:35.39]Although, I hope you guys understand that, you know, as they say, I'm just a guy.
[321:52.19]I said this earlier in the stream.
[321:55.82]And me hearing that I'm somebody's hero is just very grounding, you know?
[322:03.30]It pulls you back down to Earth.
[322:09.42]I'm happy to know that you guys get enjoyment out of this.
[322:13.19]And that I can impact your life in a way that is so incredibly fucking positive.
[322:17.99]That's... That's more than anybody could ever ask for in their whole life.
[322:24.77]That just is.
[322:28.23]Thank you for giving that to me.
[322:30.87]Thank you, Jay Hollow, for your $10 and your incredibly nice message.
[322:34.43]Thank you.

[323:33.72]Chubby Kitten, thanks for the $1.

[323:43.62]Right on, man.
[323:45.48]Thank you, Chubby Kitten.
[323:46.56]That's a quality reference.
[323:47.44]Yeah, it was.

[323:50.56]Good vibes.
[323:51.98]Great vibes.
[323:55.24]Thank you, SheXOXO for the $1.
[323:57.75]Adam Sandler for the rumble.
[323:59.35]No, no, I'm not doing that.
[324:01.75]Hey, T-O, T-O-K, T-O-K for the 10 bucks.
[324:05.63]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[324:12.55]The death of Adam Sandler is a perfect ironic time to say you've inadvertently helped me a whole lot with coping with my depression and anxiety for the past few years.
[324:21.65]Your vids are a really good distraction and reminder that things in this world are still good and funny when I forget.
[324:27.22]Thanks for that.
[324:28.72]The best thing you guys honestly the best thing you can do The world is so the world is just so dumb, right?
[324:37.58]That like why the fuck just everything is just the world is such a joke Every just just laugh at everything Like we live in such like a fucking insane world where like wild shit happens all the time
[324:58.75]But on top of how fucking crazy everything is, there are trees outside.
[325:06.52]Look at the trees out there.
[325:08.78]That's remarkable.
[325:11.18]The people that were never born, they didn't get a chance to go see a tree out there.
[325:16.69]Just that alone is worth it.
[325:21.65]Like, go to the beach, the ocean, and the waves crashing?
[325:25.26]What the fuck is that?
[325:26.14]That's incredible.
[325:27.32]That's an incredible part of Earth engineering.
[325:33.48]The fact that you can go on an airplane.
[325:35.22]You can fly in an airplane.
[325:38.17]You can fly.
[325:39.01]You ever look up at the fucking planes in the sky and you're just like, are you kidding?
[325:42.11]What?
[325:43.67]How is that even fucking possible?
[325:57.78]The point is, for all the things that are bad, that you kind of just need to shrug them off and live.
[326:12.25]There's lots of good, too.
[326:14.33]And I'm not just talking about things in nature.
[326:15.79]I'm talking about people.
[326:16.71]There's a lot of good people that are still around.
[326:19.13]There's a lot of great shit still in the world.
[326:25.87]What I learned in boating school.
[326:30.33]Is this a nice stand-up routine?
[326:33.91]No, it's like, it's magnets.
[326:36.59]Yeah, there's a, magnets work.
[326:38.15]Just like, hold, like, when you hold up magnets and they fucking click together.
[326:42.85]That's, that's, what?
[326:44.77]Huh?
[326:50.65]There is no punchline.
[326:51.67]I'm not going for a punchline.
[326:52.55]I'm just, I'm just, I'm obviously being a little over the top with this, but my point is, is that
[327:00.29]um and let me be very very very very clear about this depression and anxiety is not something to just laugh at my point with that whole thing is if you can make yourself happy like and you've said here find what helps and go with it you know but depression sucks anxiety sucks
[327:34.37]Finding decent distractions is very helpful.
[327:38.09]And I am absolutely fucking honored that you find me as a thing that helps you cope and makes you laugh.
[327:45.11]Because that shit is not easy to do.
[327:52.94]I hope that you can come out of it.
[327:57.24]I hope you find the way to make yourself feel better.
[328:03.53]Never forget.
[328:06.48]Don't forget that.
[328:10.19]Keep your head up, man.
[328:19.53]But thank you for the $10, dude.
[328:32.06]Butts?
[328:32.52]What do you mean, butts?
[328:39.66]See how much harder it is for people who have clinical depression and not just sad because it isn't like a mood?
[328:44.58]Oh, no, absolutely.
[328:45.36]Yeah, it's not.
[328:47.74]And it's very, very difficult to deal with stuff like that.
[328:53.82]There isn't a simple answer there.
[329:04.32]But when I was talking about a more general speak, right?
[329:09.19]Because there is still a lot of great shit in the world.
[329:15.63]And the stuff that you can't control.
[329:16.75]And the stuff that you have trouble with.
[329:21.58]All you can do is just put on your shoes and just try to walk the path.
[329:28.92]And try to do what you can to make your life better.
[329:31.94]Try to do what you can to get better.
[329:33.32]And it's not fucking easy.
[329:42.12]Sometimes it takes a long time, right?
[329:54.81]But yeah, like, depression and anxiety should never be laughed off.
[330:01.06]Or, you know, not taken seriously.
[330:02.82]Because it is very serious.
[330:09.96]But I wish you the best, though, Teal.
[330:15.33]Take care of yourself.
[330:19.12]Golden Cricket, thank you for the $15.
[330:22.92]I think that me and all the chat agrees that Chuck needs a place in the Rumble.
[330:26.24]He killed Death multiple times.
[330:27.94]He could match Demon Lord Zaraxas.
[330:33.89]Maybe.
[330:38.69]Give us an update on the squirrel?
[330:40.15]What squirrel?
[330:46.58]When did I talk about a squirrel?
[330:58.91]That one time?
[331:02.91]Just early in the stream.
[331:04.38]When did I say something about a squirrel?
[331:05.92]I don't remember a squirrel.
[331:13.32]Well, that pretty much tells us how the squirrel's doing.
[331:16.60]I don't know where he is.
[331:17.88]There wasn't a squirrel in my house.
[331:21.83]Somebody clip that.
[331:26.63]When did I say it?
[331:27.31]Clip it.
[331:27.65]Is there a clip?
[331:35.61]No, no.
[331:35.93]This is just bullshit.
[331:37.15]You're bullshitting me right now.
[331:38.31]Alright.
[331:38.77]Well, thank you to Golden Cricket for your $15 and your other huge amount of money, man.
[331:46.05]for this whole stream.
[331:49.11]Thank you, Sticky Brick, for the $1.
[331:51.61]Buenas tardes, amigo.
[331:52.99]Hola, my good friend.
[331:54.39]Cinco de Mayo is on Tuesday, and I hoped we'd see each other.
[331:58.96]What?
[332:01.98]No, it isn't.
[332:02.48]What are you talking about?
[332:05.70]The 5th of May is not on August 28th.
[332:12.11]Okay, thank you.
[332:13.71]Thank you, Sticky Brick, for the $1.
[332:21.88]Time Traveler.
[332:22.52]Thank you, TheZally.

[332:30.59]I'm glad you had a good time.
[332:31.43]Thank you, TheZally.
[332:33.75]Thanks for the $10 as well.
[332:37.34]And then Golden Cricket, yeah, your 50 fucking huge amount of dollars absolutely needs to be talked about again.
[332:45.24]Here's a nice Sims house break.
[332:47.69]Thank you so much, man.
[332:48.59]I'm going to call the ambulance.
[332:52.35]I'm dying of laughter.
[332:55.63]One of these days, you're going to laugh yourselves to death.
[333:01.38]Thanks a lot, man.
[333:02.98]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[333:04.28]Great stream tonight, Jerem.
[333:05.02]I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.
[333:06.26]I could watch an entire stream of just character creation.
[333:09.33]We spent like two hours making them.
[333:10.87]It kind of was a whole stream.
[333:15.57]But appreciate that, man.
[333:17.75]BroLuck, thanks for the $1.
[333:18.87]When are the Monster Rancher games coming back?
[333:21.39]They were so much fun.
[333:22.68]I still have to play Monster Rancher 4, don't I?
[333:30.22]Oh my god.
[333:34.01]We're getting some one-man mod spam right now Somebody gonna have to go and time out somebody enough to go into the time out And put the cap on the dunce cap But I don't know a bit monster answer to is the best one but still to play monster answer for eventually here I
[334:04.49]Darkstar thanks to the one dollar.
[334:05.61]I just found out yesterday that my college offers a full suite of Adobe products for free So you better believe more memes are coming off.
[334:13.94]Somebody gave this somebody gave Darkstar a fucking professional editing program No, he's gonna go wild now Any suggestions for other videos, I feel like the B one has been pushed to its limit
[334:27.57]Yeah, like, this weekend or on Friday, tomorrow or something, or eventually.
[334:31.72]I'll turn the camera on and do something else.
[334:33.74]There's like a green screen behind me.
[334:39.76]Thank you, Darkstar.
[334:41.28]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[334:42.54]Uh-oh, Jerma, looks like a hurricane's headed towards the Arbuckle residence.
[334:46.66]I've been storing water in John's freezer in an attempt to keep myself from dying from thirst as the power goes out.
[334:52.28]Wish me luck, Jerma.
[334:53.16]Also, what's your favorite video game character that would hurt your heart to see go away?
[334:59.69]uh donkey kong that's not even true that's the first thing that's the first character I could think of but uh good luck garfield that didn't sound like fun that sounds kind of scary hope you're okay honey chain thanks for the one dollar first of all sorry for starting the whole walk-in oven thing second this stream had me in tears from laughing third jermaHeart is my favorite emote jermaHeart jermaHeart
[335:26.99]Do a green screen stream.
[335:28.65]I could do a whole green screen stream.
[335:31.57]Where I just put myself in various random potential scenarios for like an hour and a half.
[335:37.00]And then just the next day or two days later, we just watch the shit that you guys make.
[335:41.68]I feel like that would be actually really fun.
[335:48.37]We're talking about like an hour and a half of me just doing pretend acting in different, like two dozen different scenarios.
[336:02.42]We'll see if I do that.
[336:03.04]That sounds like fun.
[336:07.14]Community film contest.
[336:11.26]That would be fun.
[336:17.19]It'd be a real challenge for my improv skills.
[336:20.77]I can get on top of that.
[336:26.27]But thank you, HoneyChain.
[336:29.18]Thank you.
[336:29.60]Atrolux.
[336:30.10]Atrix for the $1.
[336:30.90]I love your streams.
[336:31.58]Always watch them with my boyfriend.
[336:32.98]Thanks for all the entertainment.
[336:36.12]Glad you two are having a good time.
[336:38.58]You are very, very welcome.
[336:39.72]Thank you for watching.
[336:42.20]Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.
[336:43.69]Garf, dang it.
[336:44.33]I sent the bits before they were done.
[336:45.69]Oops.
[336:46.01]Anyway, I was considering casting Earthworm Jim in the role of your favorite lovable game character.
[336:50.65]But is there another character that you really love?
[336:55.63]Probably Donkey Kong.
[336:57.09]I would say.
[336:59.30]Yeah.
[337:02.10]Thank you, Garfield, for the $1.
[337:03.42]Appreciate it.
[337:05.36]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[337:06.96]I thought this Sims stream was going to be boring until I saw this.
[337:17.17]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[337:19.13]Hey, Jerma, just want to say you're awesome and I always enjoy watching your streams.
[337:24.11]I often watch them while I animate stuff.
[337:26.85]But I got to chill this time because I had to project rendering in the background.
[337:31.90]Nice.
[337:32.72]Watching streams and rendering?
[337:34.16]What kind of... I got a fucking supercomputer.
[337:38.06]That sounds like a pretty good supercomputer to me.
[337:40.90]Thank you for continuing to entertain.
[337:42.26]Sometimes those thoughts of what happens if YouTube shuts down keep me up at night.
[337:47.12]I just hope I can continue to do what I love like you are able to.
[337:51.48]P.S.
[337:53.78]I think that's the hardest you've laughed in a while.
[337:55.64]Take care.
[337:56.16]Oh, absolutely.
[337:58.77]Without a doubt.
[337:59.35]That's the hardest I've laughed in a long time.
[338:05.45]Thank you, Dr. Clay.
[338:08.83]Garfield the Monday Killer.
[338:11.59]Again with the $1.
[338:13.48]Gosh darn it, Jerma.
[338:14.44]I have to keep donating because you don't understand the question.
[338:17.89]I'm casting a Jerma character in the role of Spider-Man.
[338:20.87]Iron Man is Scout.
[338:21.73]Glue Man is Captain America.
[338:22.99]Beanbag is Black Panther, etc.
[338:26.21]I'm asking what new stream Jerma meme you'd cast as Spider-Man.
[338:31.34]Also, chat should probably answer too so I can get a read on who the most likable character that you are.
[338:36.36]It's probably going to be Donkey Kong.
[338:41.69]I would think so.
[338:48.31]does chat say donkey dk dk I've seen a little bit of donkey donkey kong I'm seeing a lot donkey kong donkey kong has spider-man
[339:15.64]That's just such a weird fanfiction bullshit at that point Thank You Garfield the Monday killer for the $1 look forward to seeing God the Garfield Donkey Kong spider-man routine Thank You dinosaurs Rex for the $1
[339:36.77]People muted me in the Discord for spamming Reggie voice clips.
[339:41.07]Aside from that, it's okay, I guess.
[339:42.51]I was also really excited for Music Friday for some clone hero charting, but I guess that has changed.
[339:47.83]Love you, Jerma.
[339:48.55]Why are you spamming Reggie voice clips?
[339:52.90]Hold on.
[339:53.22]I wonder why.
[339:56.80]Yeah, maybe you should stop spamming Reggie voice clips.
[340:00.92]I think I found the problem.
[340:11.62]But thank you, Dinosaurus Rex, again for your $1.
[340:14.84]I think this channel and yourself are at an absolutely great sweet spot of popularity, but still easy to communicate to.
[340:21.69]And I never want that to change.
[340:23.91]It's great only needing to donate a dollar to get a message across and showing you some cool things I've made with actual pure appreciation.
[340:31.15]I love this stream mainly because of this, and that's also a major reason I love being part of the community, because I can actually communicate with you.
[340:39.06]Yeah, I mean, we've talked about this before a couple times.
[340:43.40]If the stream continues to grow, it gets much harder for me to, you know, read every sub, read every bit message.
[340:52.82]If that happens, it's something that we have to figure out as a group of people that have, you know, there's a lot of people here, there's a lot of people here.
[341:01.85]And it would be impossible for me to do what I'm doing now with a large channel, a very large channel.
[341:09.07]right it would just be not possible they'd have to be like either a new limit or a different alternative to escape would get hard to do and I know what I never want to have happen is I never want to I never want to cut quality to have more like message reading you know what I mean like I want to keep I want to keep the streams the same way I want to keep doing what I'm doing
[341:36.55]And I would never want to compromise on any of the shit that I want to do based on, oh, well, I'm going to keep it at a dollar bit reading and instead of two hours we hang out here, it's like six.
[341:49.02]It would be just physically impossible.
[341:54.87]Because remember, at the end of the day,
[341:57.78]After about four, five, six hours, that's, you know, I'm exhausted.
[342:02.22]I'm tired.
[342:04.11]Just talking and speaking and saying things for six straight hours is taxing, right?
[342:11.61]That's something that we will have to figure out if we come to that bridge.
[342:16.03]I would like to keep community interaction as much as I can.
[342:21.42]But we're not at that bridge yet, so we don't even really have to discuss it, right?
[342:34.97]The more viewers you get, the faster, higher the counting meme will get.
[342:37.72]Look on the bright side.
[342:40.16]Oh, God.
[342:44.96]But it's something that I think about sometimes.
[342:46.84]I think we're doing alright.
[342:47.66]I think we're just fine right now.
[342:51.16]We'll see.
[342:51.74]If we have to talk about it again, we will.
[342:55.08]Don't.
[342:55.57]I did.
[342:55.91]I said it earlier, too.
[342:56.73]Just fucking ban me forever.
[343:05.15]But thank you, Golden Cricket, for the $15.
[343:09.23]You're probably one of the most honest and genuine people streaming.
[343:11.42]Keep on keeping on, my dude.
[343:15.62]All I can be is me and all I can say is the things that I would say.
[343:19.88]You hear it.
[343:26.21]I would like to be honest.
[343:27.23]I'd like to be
[343:30.45]You know, why would I not want to be honest and thankful and helpful if I can be, right?
[343:38.82]The reason why I'm able to make a living doing this is because you guys all exist and you just gave me $15.
[343:43.62]Like, I owe you the respect that you deserve.
[343:49.58]And the time that you deserve.
[343:51.14]So I think about it all the time, man.
[343:56.28]I made you.
[343:58.58]I made this guy.
[343:59.66]I made this.
[344:05.65]I made you with a smiley face.
[344:07.17]Me.
[344:10.03]No, I did.
[344:13.43]Well, you all did, so don't worry.
[344:15.71]You're all on the dev team.
[344:21.14]But that means a lot.
[344:22.94]Thank you.
[344:24.34]I hope you continue to enjoy the streams.
[344:25.88]If not, then I can do better and I'm doing something wrong.
[344:31.29]Thank you so much, man.
[344:33.47]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the two bucks.
[344:34.99]I'm glad you exist.
[344:36.29]I love you, cutie.
[344:37.13]Hey, thank you, Chubby Funster.
[344:39.63]Thank you.
[344:43.47]It's very nice of you.
[344:44.17]Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for the $1.
[344:45.47]Also, is Rat Movie 3 real?
[344:47.59]And are you making it in 3D Movie Maker?
[344:48.99]No, it's not real.
[344:50.73]I mean, it could be, but it's not currently being made.
[344:53.75]It's a real concept.
[344:55.87]You know, we went to the concept art stage.
[344:58.78]It's real.
[344:59.54]Enough.
[345:01.54]Release the song.
[345:02.44]Don't worry.
[345:03.00]I'm working on it.
[345:03.86]The song's being made.
[345:04.74]Come on, man.
[345:05.10]It takes like six years to make a good hit single.
[345:10.14]But thank you, Dinosaurus Rex.
[345:11.06]Thank you.
[345:11.38]Doubled 1-1.
[345:12.20]Doubled 11 for the $1 again here.
[345:16.15]Since you mentioned Sekiro, Shadows Die Twice.
[345:19.28]I don't know if you've seen some gameplay of it.
[345:21.86]I have.
[345:22.88]I have seen the gameplay footage.
[345:25.46]It looks to be incredibly fluid.
[345:31.32]I'm really looking forward to that game.
[345:38.60]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[345:39.96]I know what can bring me out of a deep depression.
[345:42.82]Watching the Labo streams.
[345:44.80]O-W-O.
[345:51.07]Thank you, Darkstar.
[345:54.61]And this one is not a dollar, but I'm going to read it anyways, because it's... Thank you, GamingHash.
[346:01.80]It says, your channel has seriously had an amazing impact on me.
[346:04.58]I recently found out that my friend killed himself at the young age of 19, and these streams help more than you can imagine.
[346:11.75]So, first of all, I'm terribly fucking sorry.
[346:16.89]That's awful.
[346:18.25]Absolutely terrible.
[346:21.14]That's too young.
[346:22.66]That's just too fucking young.
[346:26.00]But, thank you so much for hanging out, GamingHash.
[346:32.80]I'm glad you can get some enjoyment here.
[346:35.88]I'm really, really sorry to hear about that.
[346:45.41]Please take care of yourself.
[347:02.97]That's just terrible.
[347:06.67]But thank you for the contribution to the stream and hanging out in general gaming hash.
[347:16.07]Anyways, thank you Chubby Funster for the $2.
[347:20.71]I could do with some advice.
[347:21.65]There's a super cute guy in chat I really like, but I don't know how to woo him.
[347:25.99]Any tips?
[347:28.68]Um...
[347:32.12]I don't know me is it is it you it's you just say hi just say hi no it's me it's me no it's me I don't see I can't even give you advice I don't even know who it is anymore how am I supposed to give you advice if I don't know who it is I can't give you the perfect advice to take on this challenge
[348:02.62]I would start with, hey, what's up?
[348:05.22]That sounds pretty good, right?
[348:09.47]Thank you, chubby kitten for the $1.
[348:10.75]Tell me a bedtime story.
[348:13.29]Go to bed.
[348:16.93]Do-koom, door closed.
[348:20.12]No, hey, I'm just kidding.
[348:22.62]One time there was a prince and a princess.
[348:25.52]They were rolling dice in a back alley playing the dice roll bet cash game on the piece of cardboard.
[348:31.36]And the prince beat the princess in a two to one odds.
[348:35.11]It was fucked up.
[348:36.21]Two to one odds.
[348:36.87]I couldn't believe it.
[348:39.19]And I was in the trash can spying on them.
[348:41.21]Because I live in the trash can.
[348:45.11]Anyways, years later, I moved out of the trash can saving money and I bought a house.
[348:51.94]then I invited them over and we played dice in my living room and that's the end of the story and a good one thank you dinosaurs rex for the one dollar please do a green screen stream I will hey it's weenie thanks for the five dollars thanks for the five dollars weenie hey Jerma just realized the first video of yours I've ever seen is your subscriber special when you hit Burgah Boy with a cake it's a good one man I've been here for so long anyways I want to thank you for the aspiring words
[349:19.94]about age not affecting goals.
[349:22.36]As a 25-year-old dude hopping from job to job, I was feeling a bit down of not being in school, but when you said you didn't start this channel until late 20s, it made me feel so grounded and motivated, so thanks again.
[349:36.17]Yes.
[349:36.87]Yeah, absolutely.
[349:44.35]If you're in your early 20s right now, mid-20s,
[349:47.73]You got plenty of time to figure out what you want to do.
[349:57.92]He always says my name's Sweeney.
[349:59.46]Hey, Sweeney.
[350:06.07]The older you get, you'll develop more skills.
[350:08.97]You'll develop more as a person.
[350:12.83]Rowan built in a day.
[350:21.56]Some of the most successful people you've ever heard of didn't become the successful person you've heard of until they were in their late 30s So It's not you got plenty of time you'll figure it out we all do everybody figures it out eventually Take care.
[350:46.86]I wish you the best of luck
[350:53.12]that's not true well it depends on what you mean by we all figure it out eventually you know are we talking about being trying to be stable you know is it having a job is it you know having a getting a wife having kids and everybody has their own goals everybody has their own things to figure out it's not the same thing for everybody right
[351:24.83]You know, my goals are a lot different than your goals or your goals are a lot different than the person next to you.
[351:36.31]Money equals happiness.
[351:38.33]That is not true.
[351:45.48]Money equals pay for something.
[351:49.16]Buy things.
[351:50.50]And there are countless examples of how it's not.
[351:53.54]That's not true.
[352:00.90]Well, I'll tell you, money makes things easier.
[352:05.46]Right?
[352:06.66]But money doesn't change your personality.
[352:08.60]Money doesn't make you internally a different person.
[352:11.88]Now, some people get some money and they go nuts.
[352:27.28]It can't.
[352:27.80]Like you.
[352:29.08]What?
[352:31.16]Oh, and when did I go?
[352:32.03]What are you talking about?
[352:32.85]I went nuts.
[352:42.71]It's true.
[352:45.25]What?
[352:45.53]What are you talking about?
[352:51.46]I'm on the descent into madness.
[352:54.08]You bought all the labos.
[352:58.46]You made a $7,000 wrestling video.
[353:03.44]but is it but what it would yeah that was worth doing for me some people blow their money on fucking all kinds of dumb shit I I made a video that I'll always be able to remember and experience it in my head and remember how much fun that was and how interesting it was not like buying a watch
[353:40.99]But the thing about advice, right?
[353:44.67]And the thing about things, people saying things, nobody really knows the real answers, right?
[353:49.09]It's like, oh, money can't buy happiness.
[353:51.73]Money can buy happiness.
[353:53.23]Well, it depends on who you are.
[353:56.37]It depends on who's saying those things, right?
[353:59.31]We're all so fucking different that everybody has such different wild opinions on life.
[354:05.78]So it's very hard.
[354:08.42]It's very hard.
[354:19.13]Like, the classic theme song.
[354:21.79]The world don't move to the beat of just one drum.
[354:24.75]What might be right for you might not be right for some.
[354:30.71]That's all you need to know.
[354:39.66]I bathe in my money.
[354:40.84]Is it poetry stream?
[354:44.46]No, that's from different strokes.
[354:52.19]Shop the shop that did you have the facts live.
[354:53.99]Oh, there's a little Family Guy reference.
[354:56.07]Add it to the fucking list.
[355:04.25]He's doing more Family Guy references.
[355:15.80]Tuck me in to read me a story.
[355:17.18]Alright, I am.
[355:17.66]I already, I am.
[355:22.95]Uh, thank you, Brolok, for the one dollar.
[355:24.33]Can you please, please, can you please break the Labo?
[355:28.85]The Labos are already destroyed.
[355:30.80]They were broken down and thrown into the recycling bin.
[355:32.98]So, they're destroyed.
[355:34.34]They turned into, they turned into real pizza boxes this time.
[355:40.46]Those Labos turned into, like, shampoo bottles or something.
[355:43.26]Whatever the hell happens to them.
[355:48.60]You spend hours and money to throw them away.
[355:50.90]What am I going to do with them?
[355:51.62]Am I going to bring them with me to Las Vegas?
[355:54.70]Do you want to bring like a bunch of cardboard toys with me?
[355:57.57]What am I going to put?
[355:58.07]I have to like pack clothes and essentials.
[356:00.09]I'm not going to bring them with me to Las Vegas.
[356:03.35]What am I going to do with them?
[356:05.17]Hang them up?
[356:06.35]Like hunting trophies?
[356:13.54]No, they've been recycled.
[356:17.37]I didn't just throw them in the trash.
[356:18.97]They've been recycled.
[356:20.05]Are you saying that the Labo is not essential?
[356:26.83]That's exactly what I'm saying.
[356:28.13]I'm saying it is very much absolutely not essential.
[356:34.38]It's very expendable.
[356:40.68]I can't wait till you need them to play another Switch game.
[356:42.90]I'll just use the goddamn controller.
[356:50.08]But you recommended us.
[356:51.88]I did.
[356:53.80]It was fun.
[356:54.44]It was like going to an $80 movie.
[356:59.37]Guys, when you go to the movie in the movie theater, you don't go upstairs and grab the projector in the film reel and take it home.
[357:07.19]You experienced it.
[357:08.70]It was a fun experience.
[357:10.60]And then that's it.
[357:11.26]You go home.
[357:12.48]You throw it in the recycling bin.
[357:20.06]It's not the same thing.
[357:22.56]It's a 15 minute movie, but the Labo was like 17 hours.
[357:29.66]It was a product that I purchased and I experienced.
[357:33.86]Think of it like food.
[357:36.61]Like I, okay, I went to dinner.
[357:38.09]I went to an expensive dinner, really expensive dinner, like $150 a plate.
[357:44.85]I ate the food.
[357:46.01]Oh, I experienced it.
[357:46.75]No, this restaurant's really nice.
[357:48.11]Well, look at the stars on the ceiling.
[357:50.33]Well, they have like a whole planetarium thing in here.
[357:53.31]And then I've eaten that food and I've experienced the restaurant.
[357:56.23]I don't then go, okay, hey, which one of the chefs is coming with me?
[358:00.98]Can you come home with me and make my food for me?
[358:03.06]I've already experienced it.
[358:14.82]Stars on the ceiling.
[358:15.86]Did you eat in a kid's bedroom?
[358:20.96]You turned the food into energy.
[358:22.92]Well, I turned the cardboard into mind-stimulating brain chemicals.
[358:36.81]I ate the cardboard.
[358:38.61]Yes, I put salt and pepper on it and I slathered it with fucking Alfredo sauce and I stuffed it down my gullet.
[358:52.87]Cardboard product that can be reused as food.
[358:55.83]No, what are you supposed to do with it?
[358:57.01]The Labo is such an interesting, weird case.
[359:00.25]Because, oh cool, it's fun to build these little toys.
[359:03.19]But then you just have these fucking cardboard toys and they don't do anything.
[359:14.70]You have to turn on your switch and put the fucking switch in the piano to do anything.
[359:23.84]Otherwise, they're just hollow shells of toys that don't work.
[359:29.95]Legos?
[359:30.49]Okay, you can reuse the Legos and rebuild the Legos.
[359:33.41]Any other toys?
[359:34.17]It's a toy.
[359:34.67]It's self-contained.
[359:36.39]Those Nintendo Labo, they're not self-contained.
[359:39.41]They're just empty shells of toys.
[359:41.60]They're ghosts.
[359:43.00]Their fucking soul has been taken out of them and put inside the Switch.
[359:54.90]Make a fort.
[359:55.60]There's not enough cardboard to make a fort.
[359:58.70]But would you recommend it?
[359:59.55]Yes.
[360:02.59]As long as you eat it afterwards.
[360:06.19]But thank you.
[360:08.19]Because one guy said break the fucking Labo.
[360:10.83]And I did.
[360:11.19]I broke the Labo for you.
[360:14.18]Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for the $1.
[360:15.48]Here's some money for the green screen.
[360:17.92]Thank you.
[360:18.94]I'll get one.
[360:22.20]You don't mess with a Hot Wheel for five seconds and put it in the trash.
[360:24.84]Jesus, Jeremy.
[360:26.58]A Hot Wheel is the size of my thumb.
[360:31.26]It's not even as big as my fucking thumb.
[360:34.78]Do you want me to take around a gigantic cardboard backpack?
[360:42.98]A giant fishing rod that has no function?
[360:50.15]It doesn't have a function.
[360:57.42]You can use the backpack as luggage.
[361:07.17]Can you imagine me on a plane?
[361:08.37]Yeah, can you imagine me taking Nintendo Labo cardboard, which takes up a dickload of space, instead of...
[361:20.08]I only got like a few carry-ons.
[361:22.24]I have to stuff a bunch of carry-on shit.
[361:25.74]I got a bunch of consoles.
[361:28.08]I have the Switch.
[361:29.71]I have the Dreamcast.
[361:31.11]I have so much shit.
[361:31.97]You want me to load in a fake fucking robot cardboard backpack in there?
[361:37.69]Instead of my essentials.
[361:51.72]Ain't gonna happen.
[361:56.27]Why are you typing?
[362:36.33]okay okay sorry about that uh so thank you dinosaurs rex for the one dollar one dollar one dollar one dollar four or five dollars in the row here and they said they said uh sorry for all these bits I should stop now this is worth it love you it's very kind of you thank you for your dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar
[362:58.10]The Reaper of Memes, thanks for $1.
[362:59.44]I forgot to mention one of my old jobs was a comedian.
[363:02.13]I could always tell this one joke that never got old.
[363:04.63]And literally no one would laugh.
[363:06.41]But eventually I got L'd outside the WIO and got fired.
[363:15.21]Sorry to hear about that, Reaper of Memes.
[363:17.41]Thank you.
[363:20.41]And thank you, Thavius, for the $1.
[363:22.19]Hey, Jeremiah, I got an idea during the stream for a video.
[363:24.35]So I modified my old B joke vid for a more modern joke.
[363:29.13]Okay, a more modern joke.
[363:37.96]This one is more modern apparently.
[363:47.52]So I think the thing about, I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[363:52.66]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, hold on.
[363:55.54]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[364:00.32]Okay, he landed.
[364:01.08]What is that?
[364:01.54]Is that like a Ghostbusters?
[364:03.56]Ooh, up in smoke!
[364:07.96]I thought that was a Ghostbusters ghost catcher.
[364:10.44]Okay.
[364:12.94]Thank you, Thevious, for your bee video.
[364:16.44]It has no bees in it.
[364:17.86]I was a bee.
[364:18.34]It was a walk-in oven.
[364:20.86]That's what it was.
[364:21.86]It was flying.

[364:46.05]I don't understand.
[364:55.98]That was a joke.
[364:57.64]I hold myself to a pretty high regard, okay?
[365:02.04]I hold myself to a top-level regard, okay?
[365:10.65]No, thank you.
[365:12.63]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[365:13.73]I always felt that this clip has potential to be a funny meme playlist.
[365:17.23]If this is a snort, I'm going to end the stream.
[365:22.79]It's not?
[365:25.04]What is going on here?
[365:28.83]What the hell am I doing?
[365:32.98]What am I actually doing here?

[366:41.46]Funny meme playlist.

[366:50.08]Donkey Kong is a funny ha-ha joke, but for real.
[366:53.30]Come on, I ain't made of Garf bucks, I'm begging on my knees.
[366:56.02]Odie, beg, we gotta beg times two over here.

[368:10.91]Donkey Kong is my answer.
[368:32.95]Hates Garfield so much.
[368:35.59]No, I'm just having a little bit of a play here.
[368:38.63]Look, I'm on stage.
[368:40.23]I'm on stage.
[368:46.05]Spider SP Donkey Kong.
[368:50.91]I'm getting progressively meaner to Garfield.
[368:53.07]Alright, here's the rip.
[368:53.73]My favorite stream is Beanbag Sonic.
[368:56.32]I think so.
[368:56.72]Do you want a real answer?
[369:00.40]Uh, Wrinkle Dinkle, thanks for the $5, man.
[369:03.20]I started watching your videos last year and now just started catching your streams.
[369:07.97]Keep up the good work.
[369:08.75]Love your jokes.
[369:09.59]Hey, thank you, Wrinkle Dinkle.
[369:13.13]That's, um... That's very nice of you.
[369:16.13]Thanks.
[369:16.90]Hope you, uh, enjoy it.
[369:18.76]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[369:20.62]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[369:21.90]Final bits for tonight.
[369:22.72]Gotta save up for the rest of whenever you do your green screen stream.
[369:26.65]Might as well pour my heart out like everyone else and say that I get as giddy as a kid on Christmas morning when I come home from classes and remember that you're streaming.
[369:35.88]But unlike a kid on Christmas, I don't have to deal with the distant relatives giving me entirely two wet kisses.
[369:42.96]Oh, auntie, gross.
[369:46.64]Thank you, Darkstar.
[369:49.18]Appreciate it.
[369:52.72]That makes me happy knowing that you're looking forward to the streams.
[369:55.10]I hope you're enjoying them.
[369:59.32]Thank you to Klosky for the five bucks.
[370:03.58]Hey, Jerma, don't get to watch the streams too often, but when I do, it's always a good time.
[370:07.22]Take it easy, friend.
[370:08.86]Thank you, Klosky.
[370:12.78]Thanks for hopping in when you can.
[370:14.82]And they said, hashtag Rat Movie 3.
[370:21.05]Bro luck.
[370:21.47]Thanks for the five dollars.
[370:22.33]Thank you for telling me they're destroyed.
[370:23.93]I can rest easy.
[370:25.27]Also, I have video proof that you're loaded, mate.
[370:33.41]Do you know what interest is?
[370:34.69]Okay, there you go.
[370:35.86]Take it.
[370:38.08]Money can't buy happiness, okay?
[370:40.06]I've told you this a thousand times.
[370:47.20]Come on.
[370:56.43]He took all my goddamn money.
[371:01.15]I haven't even had a chance to smell it today.
[371:12.73]Loaded streamer gives fake advice so no one asks for his fat stacks.
[371:24.98]Fake advice.
[371:27.94]God.
[371:29.34]Now, thank you, Brolic, for the $5.
[371:31.46]Appreciate that.
[371:33.24]Chubby Funster, thanks for the $2.
[371:34.54]Hey, again, thanks for the earlier advice.
[371:36.34]Now me and I and Monk are happily together.
[371:39.87]I owe you one.
[371:40.57]Keep up being awesome.
[371:41.89]I know I just read that, but that might not even be true.
[371:43.73]We're going to have to get confirmation or detract, redact, delete what I just said.
[371:49.84]I'm seeing a no, no, no, not like that.
[371:54.04]I redact, retract, re... all the re's.

[372:34.79]He's wearing a t-shirt to his wedding.
[372:36.47]Okay.
[372:40.81]Why does she have sneakers on and a pair of jeans?
[372:46.69]That's kind of fucked up.
[372:48.10]Whatever, I guess I'm going to keep my mouth shut.
[372:49.60]Go!
[372:55.00]Okay.
[372:57.46]Okay.
[372:58.77]Donkey Kong is here.
[373:00.47]His second member of the DK crew.
[373:04.13]He's the second member.
[373:06.23]She do, do, do.
[373:08.27]You got a stout and she's little stout.
[373:11.84]She can float through the air like a trapeze.
[373:16.22]Choose her.
[373:18.16]You'll not let choose wrong.
[373:19.86]The lady gotta hop the DK song.
[373:24.01]DK.
[373:25.92]Donkey Kong!
[373:27.64]He's finally in his style!
[373:29.80]He is so grace!
[373:31.70]This Kong's got a fucked up face!
[373:35.58]He can hang on upside down, and go all around, and stretch his feet with his fucked up face!
[373:43.36]DK- Alright, let's go.
[373:48.58]Uh, thank you Zefandu for the one dollar.
[373:50.19]Can you talk about how Donkey Kong is your favorite character again?
[373:55.16]I mean, I could.
[373:57.56]I'm not sure if I can.
[374:01.39]Here we go.
[374:02.69]It's the man of the hour.
[374:04.39]It's the DK.
[374:05.57]Alright, thanks.
[374:07.97]Thank you, Dinosaurs Rex, for the $1.
[374:09.93]Remember, when you get the green screen, hit me up.
[374:12.50]Not any specific reason.
[374:13.40]I'm just lonely.
[374:16.08]Get in the Discord.
[374:18.76]I'm hitting you up right now.
[374:23.41]What up, man?
[374:24.61]What are you up to?
[374:27.47]I'm a really fast typer.
[374:34.87]Now, when I get the green screen, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[374:39.25]But thank you so much.
[374:41.37]Thank you so much, DinosaursRex.
[374:43.69]If you only have that, please, I know you're in the Discord already.
[374:47.13]Just get in there.
[374:48.95]Go play Overwatch Competitive 3v3 mode with some of the friends in there.
[374:54.98]Thank you, Junooopsito.
[375:00.38]What did I just say?
[375:01.38]Thank you for the $1, June.
[375:03.78]I had my tonsillectomy recently, and seeing schnoz do push-ups after murdering Adam Sandler in cold blood made me laugh and rip the scabs in my throat.
[375:11.71]Oh, God, no.
[375:12.75]That's not good.
[375:15.05]That's not good.
[375:16.35]I'm sorry that happened.
[375:20.90]Oh, God, that's horrible.
[375:22.30]Just...
[375:25.47]The spider!
[375:28.07]There's actually the spider back.
[375:29.47]Why are you still here?
[375:34.07]Thank you, June, though.
[375:34.91]I'm sorry to hear that that happened, but I hope you're feeling alright after the tonsillectomy.
[375:40.38]Thank you, DinosaursRex for the $1.
[375:41.74]If there was a rough estimate for said green screen, when would you do it?
[375:45.98]Probably next week.
[375:48.22]Next weekend, probably.
[375:50.14]Just go make my entire wall here a green screen and just fucking do stupid shit in front of it.
[375:58.09]But thank you, Dinosaurus Rex.
[376:00.03]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[376:01.75]I concede.
[376:02.97]Donkey Kong is a perfect fill-in for Spider-Man.
[376:06.99]He may as well be the Jerma mascot.
[376:08.68]What was Garfield thinking?
[376:10.16]Come on, Odie.
[376:11.08]To the movie set.
[376:12.34]We gotta finish it.
[376:17.80]Thank you, Garfield.
[376:20.48]Thank you, Fitty.
[376:21.99]Fitty.
[376:24.09]Thank you for the $50.
[376:24.67]I didn't even see this came right in right now.
[376:27.54]Thank you, Fitty, for the 50 bucks.
[376:29.82]Oops, I accidentally a whole bunch of bits.
[376:33.04]Just want to say that I love you and all the free content that I just paid 50 bucks for.
[376:39.39]Thank you.
[376:40.23]I'm an EU dude, so I rarely catch the streams live, but now you're still live after I got up.
[376:45.33]So here, take my money.
[376:46.97]Also, get a Bitcoin address for donations, please, and thank you.
[376:52.69]I had an Ethereum address, but I don't have a BTC address for people sending money.
[376:56.88]But I could.
[376:58.38]I could set it up.
[376:59.80]I have a BTC address.
[377:02.38]Thank you so much, Fitty.
[377:04.08]I really appreciate that.
[377:05.07]Thank you for the $50.
[377:11.25]Much appreciate that.
[377:13.43]Why did I take down the Ethereum address?
[377:14.71]Because nobody used it.
[377:17.84]I think I got sent uh ether three different times for a total of I think like six bucks over the course of like in nine months however long it was there for like six months or so so nobody was right it was like I was at the bottom of the page and it didn't nothing came up on screen so there was no one like real reason to use it unless but I mean there was there was a reason to make that cryptocurrency there's a reason to get a goddamn decentralization come on
[377:47.36]There are tons of reasons why cryptocurrency.
[377:50.08]Why do I list them?
[377:51.74]This is now going to turn into a four-hour long Crypto DK Rap.
[377:58.29]It's the board member of all the DK group.
[378:02.91]That's the last time I'm going to do that, I promise.
[378:09.37]Brolock, thanks for the $1.
[378:10.39]May I see the cute little spider, please?
[378:11.81]He's gone.
[378:12.13]I have no idea where he is.
[378:13.37]He just scared me.
[378:15.49]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1, though.
[378:16.75]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the $3.
[378:18.11]That was the best reaction from that bit I could get.
[378:20.17]Thanks for the wedding, also.
[378:22.35]Not a girl, by the way, you dummy.
[378:35.24]Sorry.
[378:35.98]Sorry about that.
[378:37.08]Hey, American520, thanks for the $1.
[378:39.56]Does DK end up reading a book at the end of this bit?
[378:41.81]Let's find out.
[378:43.07]Go to the very end of the video.
[378:49.90]I told you I wasn't going to do that again, so I'm not going to do it.
[378:53.34]But thank you for the $1, American.
[378:57.84]That's my time.
[378:59.52]I will see you tomorrow, same time, 7 p.m.
[379:03.37]Eastern Time.
[379:04.15]More The Sims, more mods.
[379:06.93]Wow.
[379:09.15]Thanks for hanging out, guys.
[379:10.61]Take care.
[379:11.55]See you tomorrow.
[379:14.09]Goodbye.
[380:01.72]Oh shit.
