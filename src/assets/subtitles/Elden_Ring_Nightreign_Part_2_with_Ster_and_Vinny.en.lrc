[ve:61.1.100]

[01:02.27]How are you doing?
[01:07.45]What's up?
[01:08.55]Good morning.
[01:10.44]Kind of an early start.
[01:11.32]I know I said I might be live today.
[01:15.72]And yeah, here we are.
[01:20.81]Not going to go as long as yesterday.
[01:22.69]Not a chance, but.
[01:25.51]I'm here.
[01:25.79]I'm ready to game.
[01:26.57]I think it's really fun playing Night Rain again.
[01:30.22]Just launched yesterday.
[01:32.64]And I'm very happy about this because like I said yesterday, I thought the game was coming out this afternoon.
[01:37.83]Which is why I said I didn't think I was going to be around for it.
[01:41.23]But the game came out yesterday.
[01:44.64]Pretty sick.
[01:48.10]Let's get the ads out of the way.
[01:49.26]If they begin right now, that would be great.
[01:56.44]You're going to play with Ludwig.
[01:57.70]I actually messaged Ludwig and said, hey, do you want to play this?
[02:03.06]He said, yeah.
[02:04.61]So maybe next week.
[02:07.09]Jump in a few different lobbies, maybe.
[02:14.88]I got a lot of stuff I gotta do next week though.
[02:17.78]Next weekend is the House Flipper invitational.
[02:21.01]So I gotta make sure that's ready to go.
[02:24.87]So I'll be spending the better half of the early to mid part of next week making sure that's ready.
[02:30.48]And getting everybody in the right place.
[02:34.06]Last minute kind of invites.
[02:35.64]Last minute commitments and stuff.
[02:37.59]Trying to get everything in the right spot.
[02:44.14]Hey, I'm the guy who asked you a few days back if you'd play Night Raid on launch and you said you'd miss it by a few days.
[02:48.63]I would like to apologize.
[02:50.03]Oh, no, you want an apology from me.
[02:52.87]I was like, oh, man, alright, well, I accept your apology.
[03:01.42]I read that way too quick.
[03:04.84]Well, I just gave you the reason.
[03:06.08]The reason is because I thought the game was coming out this afternoon.
[03:10.84]And I'm only going to be available for the next 40 minutes.
[03:15.07]So, no, I'm kidding.
[03:21.28]Hey, please play Wheel of Time again.
[03:24.71]That game was pretty fun.
[03:35.12]I don't know.
[03:36.40]Here's the thing.
[03:38.05]If it crosses the two week mark and I haven't played it, that usually means it's going to get uninstalled.
[03:46.26]From the from the bank there.
[03:52.22]That's kind of in the way it's been for years now.
[04:03.03]Did you uninstall WoW?
[04:06.08]I think it's still installed.
[04:07.84]I don't think I have a subscription, though.
[04:09.92]I don't think so.
[04:18.50]There's just so many games.
[04:20.68]There's just so many things to do.
[04:21.96]It's like something will come out.
[04:26.67]Oh, I want to do that.
[04:33.73]You want some roast chicken?
[04:38.05]This sounds pretty good.
[04:49.65]Hey, bring back Demon Lord Xeroxos plays Five Nights at Freddy's.
[04:53.40]It's your best video.
[04:55.16]Why do I have to bring it back?
[04:56.26]It's already there.
[04:56.94]The masterpiece is already there.
[04:59.25]Do you want me to try to improve on that?
[05:02.77]No.
[05:06.57]You don't touch greatness like that, okay?
[05:14.84]Me trying to do that again would be... That would be like a really cheap reunion episode at this point.
[05:22.41]No, it would just... It is what it was.
[05:25.45]It's not going to get remade.
[05:26.55]It's just there.
[05:32.98]What about Spore?
[05:33.90]Spore.
[05:35.44]Um, I don't know.
[05:38.88]Every day is a new day here, so who knows?
[05:42.18]What about the Three Stooges update for Fortnite?
[05:44.31]I said if the Three Stooges are... The ads just started, but for those of you that are still here, I did say if the Three Stooges get added to Fortnite, I will have a Three Stooges public domain marathon day where we watch three hours worth of Three Stooges movies.
[06:08.19]And then we get in there and we Victory Royale.
[06:13.48]I would play it and I have, I said, a giant sign behind me pointing down that said I was right.
[06:21.96]Which stooge are you?
[06:26.82]Curly on a Saturday.
[06:27.83]Moe on a Monday.
[06:29.91]And Larry the rest of the fucking week.
[06:33.67]There you go.
[06:43.68]Do Demon Lords of Raxos plays Five Nights at Fr- I'm not do- I didn't know.
[06:50.73]Why is that a second guy asking for that?
[06:52.97]That's a second guy asking for that.
[07:00.90]You can't be all the Three Stooges you have to pick.
[07:05.97]Probably Mo.
[07:08.61]Yeah, it's definitely Mo.
[07:16.27]curly in the streets Larry in the sheets that's funny yeah guys we can't okay somebody says Ster is moe
[07:37.90]Alright, we had three people.
[07:39.24]There's the four horsemen.
[07:41.34]Then we got the three stooges, the three amigos, the two duos.
[07:48.87]We're just playing, alright?
[07:54.24]But I would definitely be... I don't know.
[08:00.61]Who would I be?
[08:02.55]Probably like Shemp.
[08:04.82]I kind of feel like I would be a Shemp.
[08:15.01]You are all the bald one.
[08:29.79]Wasn't there a fourth stooge?
[08:31.31]Yeah, we're talking about Shemp.
[08:37.74]Habit and Costello?
[08:40.87]Yeah.
[08:40.99]Alright.
[08:41.44]uh let's we're coming back here looks like we're gonna get started hey hello everybody welcome back hello Ster hey hi are we synchronized up like 100 did you have oatmeal uh I did not have oatmeal okay I'm so sorry

[09:31.05]I was thinking about oatmeal, but I was like... No, it's not an oatmeal day.
[09:36.25]It's a heel kind of morning.
[09:39.78]It's just a little can.
[09:41.10]You don't... You don't chug like a gallon.
[09:43.72]No.
[09:46.20]Okay, well... It's 400 calories.
[09:47.52]I thought we were going to be synced up.
[09:48.94]I think our teamwork is going to be a little off.
[09:50.91]That's fine.
[09:51.75]We're just chilling.
[09:52.53]This is just a chill.
[09:53.33]We're just chilling, alright?
[09:54.35]This is just chilling.
[09:57.39]I want to try one with the archer.
[09:59.85]are you aware of the uh what is this name of this book the journal where you can start like objectives oh I was looking at that yeah you should you should do that like every run does it matter do you have to play as the character to do their remembrance yeah you have to go to the journal and then on certain character pages it'll say begin remembrance and it takes you into like a different round hold table and then you have to talk to a few people and they tell you to do something on the map
[10:29.30]I think I don't have enough to do the Iron Eye.
[10:36.33]Maybe.
[10:36.75]I don't know how it allows you to do certain ones.
[10:38.87]Maybe because you haven't played as Marksman.
[10:41.04]I don't know.
[10:41.66]But you should check if there is one.
[10:43.24]This one says, I'm certain you're aware of the destruction of the boarding house in the Duskin Valley.
[10:48.47]Route out the traitor and retire him.
[10:51.03]You can pick up his trail in the Lands Between.
[10:53.15]Okay.
[10:56.02]I guess I have to just kind of do that.
[10:58.63]boarding house in the duskin valley cool uh I think so you have to begin remembrance if it has that or I don't have it yet journal page at the bottom doesn't say begin remembrance I don't think it matters oh okay but I I don't know I definitely want to try I want to try the archer uh let's get the announcement out of the way star oh holy shit ladies and gentlemen later this afternoon
[11:26.64]in about one an hour and a half from now ladies and gentlemen we will be joined by Vinny Vinesauce I thought you were announcing the toilet stream ladies and gentlemen the string that you've been waiting for the 12-hour dump stream yeah that's he's got the heel sponsorship and he's just going to heal us all up
[11:57.49]alright I'm uh I'm ready just to so we're gonna play with randoms just for now until ready shows up okay I'm gonna have an objective to do and for when you do start doing the objectives pro tip when you do the like uh uh the thing that reveals all the stuff on the map it'll show you where your quest is oh cool uh which boss do you want to do
[12:19.53]Um, I don't think it matters.
[12:21.53]We're kind of... I'm not looking for a, hey, let's kill the gaping jaw right now.
[12:27.80]I'm looking for a, let's just... I've never played with the archer, so... I did one little trial run, but I kind of want to... I was going to say we could do another of the starting tricephalos, but he seems like the hardest boss.
[12:41.66]Yeah, just pick a random one.
[12:45.55]okay it's uh it's goat time again I'm gonna have to go somewhere on the map though been waiting for the diarrhea stream for a while now what an awful disgusting thing like what the fuck well you're gonna you're gonna have to keep waiting
[13:13.71]uh okay so when I mark enemies does do you do any more damage to that or is it just me I think well the answer is yes because everyone can see it but the mark does something weird where like after you hit them enough times the mark like pops yeah and I don't know how that works but I think we all contribute to it I also confirmed last night the duchess uh copies all of the team's damage which is why she is so strong
[13:43.68]Somebody said, I had my own diarrhea stream today.
[13:47.99]And I'm just sitting there thinking, like, what do you... I know that means you just... It's like a kind of a meta kind of joke where that means you had diarrhea, but to me, that means you, like, streamed it to, like, the boys in the group chat or something.
[14:00.18]Okay, no, what I'm thinking is, what do you think is the world record on longest diarrhea stream?
[14:04.97]As in consecutive, consistent... It's got to be... I don't know.
[14:11.46]I feel like I've come close to that record a few times, though.
[14:14.46]Haven't you?
[14:16.03]Uh, I don't, I think, I think diarrhea is sort of like a, like a shotgun blast.
[14:21.00]No, I don't think it has a duration.
[14:22.68]I think that if you get really, sometimes if you get really sick, there's been a few times where I've sat there and gone, dude, I'm getting close to the record.
[14:29.49]I think, I think everybody's been there.
[14:31.66]I just looked at the chat.
[14:32.84]It's going so fast.
[14:33.76]And the only one I was able to read was I'm leaving.
[14:42.73]Oh shit.
[14:43.01]We're at the guardian golem.
[14:48.69]Oh, this guy's moving.
[14:49.89]Alright, I got to keep up with this guy.
[14:51.35]Where'd he go?
[14:52.79]Oh, shit.
[14:53.63]We were talking about diarrhea.
[14:55.43]Yeah.
[14:56.03]Also, it's the madness boss, so I dropped some, you know, remove madness from yourself baubles.
[15:01.82]Oh.
[15:02.14]Could be very useful.
[15:08.95]Let me in.
[15:09.35]Let me in.
[15:10.09]Let me in.
[15:10.45]I... How do I get in there?
[15:16.01]Leveling.
[15:19.30]How the fuck do I get in here?
[15:22.68]He's just going to kill it without me.
[15:24.79]You have to go in under the bridge.
[15:26.29]Is it up?
[15:26.81]I was just down there.
[15:27.69]It looked like there was a wall.
[15:29.42]I went too fast.
[15:29.86]Yeah, you have to go all the way to the back of the room.
[15:32.28]I wasn't paying attention.
[15:33.00]This is why this one is... Oh, you're behind the castle.
[15:37.63]Yeah, I just walked in that front door.
[15:40.23]You walk in the sewer...
[15:43.19]Was there a way I wasn't going?
[15:45.84]Am I just crazy?
[15:46.44]Yeah, you gotta kill the rats and shit.
[15:47.64]He's already fucking almost done with it.
[15:49.58]Where is it from here?
[15:53.13]You'll never know, I guess.
[15:54.33]Oh, it's around the fucking corner.
[15:55.35]He's going to have already killed it.
[16:00.00]Oh, he sprinted past, like, everything.
[16:03.08]That's what confused me.
[16:03.85]I thought he was fighting things, and I was like, wait, he's up there.
[16:08.61]Well, we queued into a gamer.
[16:15.12]I wish there was a VGS system where you could just be like, nice attack.
[16:19.49]Shazbot.
[16:21.25]I would love a Shazbot.
[16:22.05]Alright, where are we going from here?
[16:31.77]I need to get to whatever the towers that shows the map icons.
[16:36.27]I'm already like level fucking three.
[16:45.17]Ooh, the Misiocord.
[16:51.50]He had a key?
[16:54.43]Dude, why is he already... Holy shit, this dude's already got 50% of his health gone.
[17:01.48]Okay, we're with a gamer.
[17:06.25]Oh, I have it on me.
[17:07.53]Okay, I have to go do that.
[17:19.75]Years of raiding.
[17:22.31]We're like already killing this every jail boss.
[17:26.78]This is a gamer.
[17:27.60]This is an actual gamer.
[17:40.47]He's just marking shit.
[17:41.39]He's moving.
[17:49.35]What the hell did he just do?
[17:52.03]That was so weird.
[17:53.13]Wait, he wants to fight the dragon?
[17:54.42]This guy's crazy.
[18:02.18]Believe in him.
[18:03.53]I do.
[18:03.89]I completely believe in him.
[18:11.37]I'm out here doing my fucking quest.
[18:14.74]Are we not fighting this guy?
[18:15.92]Oh, I think we're leaving.
[18:19.93]Okay, this is... This guy is, like, spinning around in circles.
[18:42.36]Oh shit, he's just going... I gotta keep up with this guy.
[18:45.88]I've got... I've got more going on here than I expected.
[18:50.91]Just pick up everything.
[18:55.37]What'd I get?
[18:55.75]Uh, a harp bow.
[18:58.58]Oh, okay.
[19:10.75]Oh, fuck!
[19:11.69]Oh, fuck!
[19:14.69]I'm just gonna follow this guy.
[19:15.64]He seems to know what he's doing.
[19:29.67]OK, we are.
[19:31.27]I would love to get a flask.
[19:34.26]Where are you?
[19:34.68]Are you down there?
[19:36.22]Yeah, I'm fighting like a mini boss.
[19:38.28]It's kind of annoying because there's three of them.
[19:41.09]We have a lot of health.
[19:42.37]Oh, the circles coming in, but I just want to do my goddamn quest.
[19:46.03]I accomplished nothing while you guys do all that.
[19:49.32]If I lose this guy, I'm going to be like a kid lost at Disneyland.
[19:53.78]It's going to be bad, so I need to stay with this guy.
[19:56.83]I'm just slash following him.
[20:13.34]thought he lost connection for a second I was about to say oh I am lost in disneyland that's a good one shouldn't we be leveling oh never mind go wait what was there might be something in here oh just whatever
[20:39.45]Oh no, this corner is the death corner.
[20:43.04]Yeah, you're in trouble.
[20:45.10]That thing is going to collapse on you.
[20:49.22]This guy already got up here.
[21:00.20]No, he's right here.
[21:05.89]This is going to be in the circle, right?
[21:07.21]Yeah.
[21:11.07]I'm good I'm good I feel bad though because I really have accomplished nothing I really just thought I could go grab my quest what was your what was your quest what'd you need to get uh I need to pick some it was like pick some flowers or something but it was guarded by three guys and a lot of these quests are at the edge of the map you need to do them like right away maybe it's wait for a day two kind of angle
[21:41.13]I did- that was such an overkill.
[21:54.64]I'm... Oh, fuck!
[22:02.25]Oh, I heard a jingle bug down there.
[22:09.95]The efficiency is off the charts with this guy.
[22:33.90]Oh, by the way, if something's on the ground, if you hold triangle and press up, you will just take it.
[22:42.95]You'll just use the item on the ground.
[22:44.69]It's actually kind of useful.
[22:46.05]Like, even if you don't care, just take it.
[22:47.69]Just use it.
[22:49.89]Okay.
[22:55.54]That actually does come up a lot.
[23:02.47]Okay.
[23:04.42]I am not being efficient this is not a good pov uh we're I think we're gonna be fine because this guy um oh you guys are right near me this thing is this thing is cranking me oh my god we got a lion over here and it's very scary
[23:34.70]I'm coming to you guys.
[23:43.23]That's the best thing that could have happened.
[23:53.12]Oh, actually, I'm kind of screwed, aren't I?
[23:55.35]I can't go that way.
[23:59.45]Wait.
[24:01.96]Can I get up there from here?
[24:08.02]Oh, fuck.
[24:08.47]No, I don't want to go that way.
[24:12.83]How do I get back up there?
[24:17.92]He died.
[24:18.80]Yeah, he did.
[24:19.36]I can get him, but... Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[24:22.25]It's about to end.
[24:28.32]Fuck.
[24:28.66]I fell off and I couldn't get back up.
[24:35.50]Did I run past a staircase?
[24:36.70]I don't know.
[24:38.22]I got to get this map into fucking permanent knowledge.
[24:40.85]This is so hard.
[24:42.67]I'm starting to get it, but also there really are a lot of variations that are going to come in.
[25:03.02]Rain Scabbo.
[25:08.32]Uh, it's coming in.
[25:09.36]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:11.60]Oh, fuck.
[25:13.14]From what... Ugh.
[25:16.39]Oh, this is bad.
[25:21.33]I'm dead.
[25:22.32]Really?
[25:22.68]You... I'm outrunning it.
[25:24.12]I was right next to you.
[25:25.34]I just... Everything's just going too quick.
[25:30.68]Man, I could have maybe got you.
[25:31.61]I had 94,000 souls.
[25:33.97]Ah, you should have said that.
[25:36.29]I would have gotten you.
[25:37.75]I'm dead.
[25:41.40]We split up.
[25:41.96]Oh no, this guy's dead too?
[25:45.48]We split up too early.
[25:48.07]Ah.
[25:49.27]I fucked everything.
[25:51.39]I'm going to wait for day two on any quest.
[25:54.58]Oh, fuck.
[25:57.84]That's my bad.
[26:02.67]Oh.
[26:05.15]You know it's you can't win the first game of the day now.
[26:11.98]Plus I had never played this before.
[26:15.23]It's I'm starting to realize how how actually important communication really is.
[26:20.37]Yeah.
[26:21.49]Because like I could follow this guy.
[26:22.67]I could just run behind him, but you know if it was a call being like up here.
[26:27.02]Yep, this way.
[26:27.92]Alright, yeah, you get that item.
[26:29.36]Got it.
[26:30.52]It's just so much easier.
[26:32.64]Even just item sharing when you have stuff people need.
[26:42.42]I think we get this.
[26:57.71]He's dead again.
[27:00.47]Oh, I can't even get that.
[27:02.27]I thought this guy was the fucking gamer.
[27:14.35]The whole run is just fucked.
[27:16.68]I'm fighting the ancient hero of Zamora right now.
[27:21.43]I'm level three.
[27:22.39]I could be like level eight right now.
[27:23.57]You're level three?
[27:25.71]I feel like I've been doing bad.
[27:27.43]Dude, there was no time to stop.
[27:30.48]We were in a full sprint the whole time we were playing.
[27:34.10]You didn't have to.
[27:34.90]I know, but I had to.
[27:36.22]Dude, the auto-use item tech, actually pretty big though.
[27:51.35]I'm level seven.
[27:53.07]I'm level three.
[27:54.93]Okay.
[27:55.81]He's probably similar now.
[28:23.90]it would appear these enemies have a lot of health they kind of do either that or we're level three hard to tell first time playing the character I should have went with you at least I would have gotten my quest did
[28:52.99]You said you can backstab people with a bow?
[28:55.24]Yeah.
[28:56.86]Or when they're down on the ground, you can do like the weak point attack.
[29:11.55]I think my scaling with this weapon might just be atrocious.
[29:30.67]Oh my God, he died.
[29:32.54]I can't even go get him.
[29:34.28]I guess I could shoot him.
[29:35.80]Well, he's also like three ticks already.
[29:38.04]He wants it to end.
[29:43.25]It looks like he's crawling up the cliff.
[29:45.23]He wants to die.
[29:47.43]We have to finish it.
[29:49.21]Let us die.
[29:53.52]I have to do my quest, man.
[29:54.98]I need day two.
[29:56.06]I'm just going to sprint to the quest.
[29:57.91]Well, that's why I didn't go with you, because I thought you were just going to pick up an item or something.
[30:02.60]Me too.
[30:10.57]Oh, nice.
[30:11.29]What the fuck?
[30:12.33]I hit everybody?
[30:14.39]This guy's going to get very mad that we're going to do this second day.
[30:22.10]You want to just wipe it, or do you want to wipe it?
[30:26.68]Oh, he left.
[30:28.23]Oh, yeah.
[30:28.85]I can't even revive him.
[30:31.32]Maybe we should just die then.
[30:32.98]Well, now we kind of have to.
[30:35.31]Okay, yeah, let's die.
[30:37.52]That was a good warm-up game.
[30:54.48]Well, I feel pretty good as MVP.
[30:59.70]Ooh.
[31:02.51]All I did was chase around a dung beetle.
[31:05.41]Hey, this is all a warm-up until Vinny logs on.
[31:07.61]Don't you guys understand?
[31:09.86]And Vinny, having never played, is actually going to, like, embarrass us.
[31:14.84]No, no.
[31:15.40]It's going to be fine.
[31:16.13]It's going to be fine.
[31:16.73]No, embarrass us as in, like, he's going to be, like, way better than us.
[31:19.79]Oh, I see what you mean.
[31:23.56]Okay.
[31:27.77]I have to um dude I'm I gotta piss and I've got a fucking coffee raging yeah how about you how about you follow the guy who you're talking to this time hey you said I'm gonna go do my quest just leave me be you said just leave me be that's the new plan the guy I the guy I was with was like a pro he was just running I didn't I didn't even know where Grace was we were talking about diarrhea if he was a pro he wouldn't have died three times before the boss I got a coffee raging through me uh actually I want another coffee
[31:59.12]So I'll be right back.
[32:00.07]That's the Huel diarrhea stream.
[32:02.41]Hey, I don't want to hear that slander.
[32:09.15]Hey, go for it.
[32:10.21]I can tell you've got some business to take care of.
[32:12.52]I'll be right back.
[32:19.58]I'm so glad nobody heard that.
[32:21.82]And in fact, why don't you say it again?
[32:24.13]Because that's what I'll leave you with and I'll be back.
[32:27.50]Wait, you're so glad no one heard it, but you want me to say it so they hear it.
[32:30.38]Yeah, because I want people to know how disgusting you really are.
[32:32.91]I said, is Huel like Soylent and is it all white when it comes out?
[36:25.61]at least some sort of conspiracy here yeah for those of you that didn't hear what I just said um I think okay let's redo the bit well I I didn't realize I wasn't my microphone wasn't on I feel like headphones have become harder to put in
[36:43.86]I feel like it used to be just... Oh, just put... They're in.
[36:47.16]I feel like I have to do surgery and... Hold on.
[36:50.44]Put my hair over this way and... Wait, wait, wait.
[36:52.35]Hold on.
[36:52.63]That's... The thing is sticking up.
[36:54.67]I need to push that down.
[36:56.27]I feel like they've gotten harder to put in.
[37:00.37]Some of them are weird and I like... I put them on backwards every time.
[37:04.86]That's what I'm saying.
[37:05.52]Also... Maybe it's just me.
[37:09.43]I definitely have two different ear hole sizes.
[37:13.32]I'll let you guess which one is the smaller one the right one but on your own time no I'm not telling uh but like if I use the same earphone nobules like my left ear will hurt I have to get like a tinier one on the left ear so I guess now you know okay I just remember a time when you and by the way another here's another take for all of you
[37:38.26]headphone quality has gone down the toilet.
[37:42.67]I'm talking the actual quality of the sound.
[37:46.25]It feels like every pair of earphones I get, sound... Listen to this shit.
[37:54.54]Airplane-free headphones.
[37:58.35]You know the fucking headsets, the headphones they hand out?
[38:01.90]It's like $3 for these shitty airplane headphones.
[38:05.48]They're all like this now.
[38:07.98]They're all like this now.
[38:10.68]I... The thought of that angers me.
[38:13.28]I'd forgotten about that.
[38:14.59]Yeah, it is infuriating.
[38:16.53]No, for different reasons.
[38:17.97]For them basically handing you disposable electronics.
[38:22.48]Oh, yeah.
[38:23.52]Oh, yeah.
[38:23.82]Oh, yeah.
[38:24.14]Oh, thanks for coming on the flight.
[38:25.24]Here's like... You're going to throw this out in 30 minutes.
[38:28.95]We manufactured this in a factory.
[38:31.74]And we put the whole thing together and we spent like a millennium of human innovation to even be able to make this.
[38:37.73]And you're going to throw this out in 30 minutes.
[38:40.29]Fast fashion.
[38:41.49]Talk about like fast earphones.
[38:45.24]That's true.
[38:45.92]No one's talking about this.
[38:49.02]Well, you are.
[38:51.56]I know because it upsets me every time I feel like something is just like.
[38:56.00]just completely waste it like that I got sent a PlayStation 5 like console cover from like doing some sponsored thing oh you're gonna own a PS5 you will very soon you keep saying that yeah but I got busy over the last I got busy I got busy yeah you're gonna I you're gonna have a PS5 the point is it feels bad because it's like okay thanks for sending to me this like guilt of just you sent me garbage
[39:26.62]Dude, somebody said that they can't fit a quality driver into a headphone.
[39:32.23]Bose?
[39:34.80]Go back and watch any video or stream from 2012 to 2020.
[39:42.49]I had these.
[39:44.32]They were perfect.
[39:47.10]They were the Bose headphones with the gel.
[39:49.36]The quality was incredible.
[39:51.64]I would sit there and listen to music.
[39:53.88]It didn't... They weren't uncomfortable.
[39:56.71]They don't even fucking make them anymore.
[39:58.63]There is a giant conspiracy to make all electronics dog shit.
[40:02.59]You know where it actually started to go downhill, I think, is the iPod.
[40:06.92]And they started selling the iPod with those little, like...
[40:09.97]perfectly plastic non they're not shaped like an ear at all those things are designed to hurt and you get like oh iPod 2 is out and like this well you got to get the new one with the new plug your phones now the phones piss me off a lot of phones like my phone doesn't have a a earphone Jack like if I want to like plug in some earphones and listen to something on my phone oh no it has to be like bluetooth now oh so now I need new headphones again
[40:36.48]Oh, and excuse me, what's that?
[40:38.10]Oh, the Bluetooth headphones have like a half second audio delay, so you can't fucking use them for anything besides just like listening to a song.
[40:46.45]Everything else has like a third of a second delay.
[40:50.59]yeah go off yeah it sucks I've tried dude I've tried to do bluetooth headphones really good high quality ones and wow oh the sound quality is just it's just immaculate wow you can hear all those highs and all those lows don't play any video games with them because it's like a half a second delay no matter what you do because bluetooth the signal by its very design sucks so but just like listen to that song in the in your study
[41:22.93]I don't know.
[41:24.94]We're getting got.
[41:26.46]I own three sets of headphones.
[41:29.50]I have an open ear, a closed ear, and a wireless one that are just like all sitting around my computer somewhere and all have like their own purpose.
[41:36.25]And I don't want this.
[41:39.08]This isn't the life I envisioned for myself when I was like, you know, in middle school.
[41:44.42]I just had like one earphone in middle school.
[41:47.89]Where are we going?
[41:48.73]Where are we going?
[41:50.53]uh this castle is straight south I need the uh the map let's level up here and then we kind of have a weird party here don't we uh we're gonna do a lot of damage I can tell you that I wonder if her using the clock triggers my clock attack you know what I'm saying go off on clocks what happened to the good clocks
[42:22.05]The ones that hang on the wall?
[42:23.15]I don't want a watch.
[42:23.91]I want a good clock.
[42:24.99]I want a good grandfather clock.
[42:26.47]A watch?
[42:28.03]What's going on with this bullshit?
[42:29.96]You know, I had been thinking about this recently.
[42:32.70]Because I realized, like, when I'm in bed in the morning, I want to know what time it is.
[42:36.80]So I know if I should get out of bed or if I should stay in bed for six hours.
[42:40.31]Sure.
[42:41.97]And I realized, like, I've just been using my phone.
[42:44.57]I leave my phone in my bed.
[42:45.75]I was like, why don't I just have, like, a normal clock?
[42:49.77]Yeah, why don't you?
[42:51.29]so this all started with the iPod tim apple I I the clocks probably still exist I was just kind of having fun with it so the clock probably exists guys don't worry I don't I haven't seen evidence of it but they're probably out there
[43:18.68]Like, somewhere.
[43:20.22]We're not together.
[43:21.86]I don't know if that's a bad thing.
[43:23.83]We're not together.
[43:35.90]Okay.
[43:36.02]I'll get the adds.
[43:46.35]I wish we were together.
[43:52.24]Kill it!
[43:57.95]No!
[43:59.43]I dodged it.
[44:00.01]I just wanted to give a little suspense to the viewers.
[44:02.10]You know what I mean?
[44:03.66]I know what you mean.
[44:07.38]Sorry, I'm looting.
[44:08.25]I'm getting the map.
[44:09.09]I'm trying to be time efficient like that one gamer that died three times in our other game.
[44:14.45]He actually was really good.
[44:16.88]He was very good.
[44:17.74]I just was not.
[44:18.82]I was too slow for him.
[44:19.78]I just was.
[44:21.20]and and I split up so he was probably just like these these redditors are you going on Reddit what did you what did you say uh last night when you put you have to say what you said I've been repeating something like that no you uh it was like oh I got these redditors in my group that they're not doing enough damage there was something funny
[44:45.65]You had to be there.
[44:46.91]You had to be there.
[44:48.12]I think it was the same.
[44:48.78]It was not grouping up.
[44:50.06]Where are they?
[44:51.48]He's playing with Holly and Ashley.
[44:54.46]He was like, where's the damage?
[44:58.17]No, you said you were going to go on Reddit and complain about them.
[45:01.19]Yeah, that's what you do.
[45:09.06]Okay, where is... Well, I'm going to do my objective in day two.
[45:11.66]There's a church right here.
[45:14.16]let's church it up yes let's church it up I so I got a relic that has um your flasks heal allies on it I'm not using it right now but in general I'm just saying I that is a thing that exists uh which seems like you could have one guy just go collect all of the flasks and like be the team healer
[45:38.25]Is it a one to one?
[45:40.00]I don't know.
[45:42.10]I haven't really used it in a group yet.
[45:45.60]So are we doing the eagle or are we just going?
[45:49.33]Just going down the cliff.
[45:51.35]Okay.
[45:54.24]Oh, that is Holly.
[45:56.82]I didn't realize that.
[45:59.42]Wait, what?
[46:01.23]Isn't it?
[46:04.23]Burger?
[46:05.52]Are we playing with Holly right now and just don't even know?
[46:08.75]No, no, we're not.
[46:09.37]No, we're not.
[46:09.83]That'd be insane.
[46:17.31]No, okay, we're not.
[46:18.56]Okay.
[46:18.80]Yeah, I was like, what the fuck?
[46:21.94]Where's the bug?
[46:22.46]There's like a cookie bug here somewhere.
[46:25.72]I think he's up the hill one.
[46:27.56]Yeah, we kind of got to go.
[46:31.69]We got to go.
[46:38.78]improves jump attacks you want that jump bow is pretty decent I think that works uh this guy is gonna have to move in we should we even try doing one of these rise things rise monster on a rise the little tower things
[47:05.73]No, honestly, I don't understand them at all.
[47:09.50]That's where we need the game facts.
[47:13.97]By the way, this is buried treasure.
[47:15.97]I don't know what that means, but we should probably look.
[47:17.97]I looked it up.
[47:19.69]And my codex.
[47:32.43]Okay.
[47:48.56]Okay, we have time to do this if we're quick.
[48:04.76]Oh shit, you brought a friend.
[48:12.65]Stunning!
[48:15.01]Oh my god, I just killed like everybody behind him too.
[48:26.85]Damn.
[48:32.94]Circles here, circles here.
[48:35.40]Where's the last one?
[48:36.03]There's one more guy.
[48:38.77]I don't know.
[48:39.63]Can't do it.
[48:41.17]What about this buried treasure?
[48:43.38]Maybe we can just get it?
[48:44.20]I mean, I've looked for those before.
[48:46.66]I don't know what it looks like at all.
[48:53.65]Do you need like a... I don't know.
[48:58.14]supposed to be right here somewhere oh well there's usually an x that marks the spot oh my god dude you've got to be fucking kidding me FromSoftware this this is a joke that's a that's that was a hilarious joke that just got played on if you've got flasks you're good
[49:29.61]This game needs work.
[49:34.62]Alright, let's castle.
[49:36.50]Yeah, we got big castle here and we're all together.
[49:39.16]That's good.
[49:39.66]Looking good.
[49:57.67]Oh, we're invisible.
[50:06.36]cool that guy's freaking out right in the head
[50:31.84]Do you believe in our ability to go into the basement?
[50:37.39]Yeah.
[50:39.45]A lot of runes.
[50:41.04]Yeah, we can do it.
[50:49.87]I've got my ult ready.
[50:52.81]I don't know.
[50:53.17]I think it's just me and you right now, though.
[50:56.09]We are going to need this third guy.
[51:00.79]Maybe we should axe it.
[51:06.79]Let's do a boss if it's misbegotten.
[51:08.85]Oh, you know, we're fine.
[51:09.74]Let's do this.
[51:10.12]Are we good?
[51:11.14]This guy's not as hard.
[51:24.55]Stunning.
[51:26.97]Oh, did what?
[51:28.22]Did that not even hit him?
[51:29.78]That's weird.
[51:46.31]Oh, you are dead.
[51:57.47]The other person is showing up.
[52:02.64]With them we should have enough damage.
[52:04.18]Oh my god.
[52:05.39]I got hit and killed in one hit.
[52:10.11]Oh shit, they're down too.
[52:20.55]Maybe we are in some trouble here.
[52:24.86]Maybe this is a more of a day two activity as well.
[52:32.02]Oh my God, yeah, this is bad.
[52:38.83]Abort abort.
[52:41.11]OK, abort.
[52:42.33]Yeah, get up.
[52:45.22]Circles coming in abort.
[52:52.65]yeah it sucks I guess I'm I don't know I feel like we've done very well in there but maybe those were day twos I I feel like the bell bearing hunter has a lot of health they're very tanky
[53:14.64]He does, and I guess I'm still on starting weapon.
[53:17.62]Yeah, I haven't really found anything either.
[53:19.38]I've got like one decent bow.
[53:21.44]Did we get this church up here?
[53:22.61]It looks like we did.
[53:23.73]I think they stay like gold if we didn't.
[53:27.27]We have not got it.
[53:27.93]It's true.
[53:36.06]You should go to tomato town.
[53:38.84]That's usually where we drop, but...
[53:42.36]I hate tomatoes, to be honest.
[53:47.95]Oh, the remix just dropped.
[54:02.02]My friend!
[54:05.80]Okay, I can pick it up!
[54:20.82]Tell him you're the sus guy.
[54:25.81]He knows.
[54:26.51]He already knows.
[54:28.61]Exactly.
[54:29.21]You guys want me to tell people I'm the sus guy?
[54:30.93]They already know.
[54:31.87]They knew a week ago.
[54:34.64]Yeah, just say I'm the sus guy and look him in the eye and then wink.
[54:51.45]uh I'm only level six problem uh me too
[55:20.86]Oh, you would bite the hand that feeds?
[55:27.13]I can't.
[55:27.73]I can't.
[55:28.95]I can't believe I got away from them.
[55:38.84]Like one more?
[55:39.32]I think we get a reward for these.
[55:41.38]Do we?
[55:47.17]Yeah, I think this is a special event.
[55:52.49]Oh, it summons a... Centipede Demon?
[55:56.33]What the fuck is this?
[55:57.77]This is from Dark Souls.
[56:04.62]Should we jump?
[56:16.78]I don't know.
[56:31.00]I still think about that.
[56:42.13]It's very obscure.
[56:43.77]Its head, its leg, its arm came off!
[56:47.38]Dude, this is Monster Hunter Wilds.
[56:57.91]Oops, what?
[57:09.57]Wait, it got its tail back.
[57:11.03]That sucks.
[57:29.65]Nice.
[57:30.95]Oh, yeah.
[57:38.51]I guess the hands were a part of the start of this.
[57:40.29]We haven't fought that boss in day one, so.
[57:46.32]Sound kind of good.
[57:49.06]Successive attacks, restoring HP on Dagger Dagger World.
[57:54.53]Of that.
[57:55.73]Still only I need to go do my quiz to now.
[57:58.55]OK, I'm just going to follow you.
[58:00.02]I need a better item or something.
[58:01.44]I've only level 74 and that's it.
[58:05.06]Or 74 damage.
[58:13.48]Yeah, I'm just running straight towards my marker.
[58:16.54]We should get the church too.
[58:24.11]I'm getting church.
[58:27.18]This person might also be trying to do the same quest as me.
[58:31.75]Look at you, two peas in a pod.
[58:34.55]There's a chance, but I don't know.
[58:36.09]They're marking other stuff.
[58:39.64]They also did not want the church.
[58:43.23]look for the seal you'll never find it by the time you find it the circle's coming in are we just going down there to fight that super boss uh I guess he's already started so I'll help
[59:10.90]I'm coming.
[59:11.36]Don't worry.
[59:11.94]Don't worry, dear.
[59:13.27]Help is on the way, dear.
[59:15.17]What's that from?
[59:18.64]Um... Pee-wee's Big Adventure.
[59:19.82]Nope.
[59:21.46]Good guess, though.
[59:27.89]Ah...
[59:33.23]If fighting this messes up completing my quest, I'm actually going to scream.
[59:39.00]I hope you don't.
[59:39.56]It's not good for your vocal cords.
[59:43.27]This thing has a lot of health.
[59:50.79]It's fucking me up.
[59:51.77]I don't like it.
[60:00.67]This person just fucking... They left, Jerma, they left.
[60:11.27]What do you mean?
[60:12.07]Are we not doing this?
[60:12.70]Let's go to my objective.
[60:13.62]Yeah, they're not with us.
[60:15.44]I was locked in, man.
[60:17.27]Yeah, me too.
[60:28.44]There's a red wolf up the hill behind this which usually does not have 7 million hit points.
[60:36.57]Oh burger, you're.
[60:39.09]Getting kind of killed over here.
[60:40.20]Oh wait, I need help.
[60:43.49]I'm coming.
[60:55.27]These are not great enemies to fight three of.
[60:58.06]Guardians of the Dew.
[61:13.64]Shotgun blast.
[61:14.64]Shotgun blast.
[61:23.78]Skyshot.
[61:32.81]Skyshot doesn't do anything.
[61:34.47]I think you really have to shoot at things above you.
[61:49.71]okay objective achieved did I get that too that seems to give everyone the souls I get for it so we got like 30 000 from holy we did uh there's a red wolf up here do you want to fight it sure we might not have time like if we hit it and it doesn't take a lot of damage then we're leaving um it seems okay oh it knocked me down
[62:17.46]Okay, that was weird.
[62:26.68]I did the stealth.
[62:28.77]Oh, that's what's going on.
[62:36.31]That move is so insanely good.
[62:40.06]What?
[62:42.56]That stealth.
[62:45.08]Yeah.
[62:47.65]It's not like normal Dark Souls stealth.
[62:50.13]It really like... They cannot see you at all.
[62:54.29]Yeah, you just get to keep backstabbing people.
[62:56.18]Nothing breaks it.
[63:05.33]That was a mistake.
[63:06.19]Good thing you didn't attack me.
[63:17.82]Circle's coming in.
[63:18.66]We need to do it like now.
[63:20.08]Fuck, we do have to kill it.
[63:24.49]Okay, it's dead.
[63:25.15]But what about... Did it drop anything?
[63:27.11]We need to get the reward.
[63:42.25]Well, it was well-timed.
[63:43.74]We're good in that case.
[63:55.69]Not even that much better than what I have.
[63:58.69]I didn't really get anything for it.
[64:01.16]I got a lot of souls though.
[64:02.46]I'm glad I did not die.
[64:03.48]Wait, do I?
[64:12.68]Have a stone sword.
[64:14.50]Oh, nothing.
[64:15.68]We can't even do it anyways.
[64:24.44]I would love a Grace.
[64:25.26]I think what I may have been misunderstanding is I think day two, I don't think the enemies scale.
[64:30.89]I think it adds some new encounters, but I think that like guy in the sewer is probably still the same strength.
[64:37.51]I don't know.
[64:38.63]We're definitely stronger now, but I wouldn't want to go in there until I hit a Grace.
[64:51.61]Grace up here.
[64:54.66]What did the little cookie bug drop?
[64:58.03]The what?
[64:58.67]The little cookie bug.
[64:59.55]I didn't see what it dropped.
[65:01.53]I don't know.
[65:01.85]The other person got it.
[65:07.56]What the fuck?
[65:09.16]Yeah, let's go to the red marker.
[65:20.72]Ooh, more runes from defeated enemies.
[65:28.31]That thing sucks, but whatever.
[65:35.58]One of these guys is just right here?
[65:53.69]Yikes.
[65:55.01]Invisible.
[66:03.67]what the fuck oh it's another sky shot again what the hell got him that was good family heads improved casting speed plus 60. okay that's pretty good I don't know all this stuff kind of sucks
[66:32.81]Um, where to?
[66:37.79]This person's doing a lot of pins.
[66:41.20]We should definitely get, yeah, closer to the middle.
[66:47.99]Hey, can you wake me up when he's at Mohg?
[66:52.73]What are you?
[66:53.27]No.
[66:54.23]Wait, Mohg is in the game?
[66:58.18]I'm wearing my Mohg t-shirt, my Mohg hat, I have my Mohg mug.
[67:02.71]I was waiting for the surprise.
[67:05.09]Because I heard that they had some new assets and some old assets and stuff and that that that might.
[67:13.18]Feel like I just why you just told me the whole ending to Infinity War.
[67:17.29]Hey, it's it's not Mohg.
[67:18.21]It's a Mohg like.
[67:22.11]So it could really be very different.
[67:23.57]You don't know that.
[67:26.18]We're going to go in the castle.
[67:28.68]Moog Mohg.
[67:32.36]I think we already did that.
[67:33.18]Yeah, castle is done.
[67:34.24]Castle is done.
[67:36.17]This person marked to go into the going to go in a cave.
[67:39.95]Yeah.
[67:48.52]Mohg.
[67:49.28]Sometimes Mohg would grant us eyes, grant us eyes.
[67:56.01]Where is it though?
[67:58.29]We're all just standing around.
[68:02.30]It's probably down.
[68:14.11]We're not.
[68:15.84]I'm not following him.
[68:16.70]We're idle.
[68:17.38]We're very idle right now.
[68:18.42]It's true.
[68:18.82]Wait, we got this.
[68:20.62]We did this somehow.
[68:21.36]We did this secret.
[68:24.45]What's in there?
[68:25.97]A bunch of starlight shards.
[68:30.04]Oh no, this one's fucked.
[68:32.22]Upstairs is where the door is.
[68:34.76]Yeah, I'm following you freaking clowns around.
[68:39.01]I'm coming with you.
[68:43.79]I mean, we did a lot of the stuff on the map.
[68:45.49]I think the circle just cut us off from a lot of the things that we hadn't done, unfortunately.
[68:50.44]What about these ruins over here?
[68:52.60]Did we do that already?
[68:57.27]No.
[68:57.59]No.
[68:59.15]Okay, let's do it.
[69:00.68]Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
[69:26.84]Circles coming.
[69:27.74]We don't have a lot of time.
[69:29.70]Do you think we have enough time to kill this?
[69:31.87]We might.
[69:33.77]It's about time to run at the very least.
[69:45.31]There's another one somewhere.
[69:48.69]Where is he?
[69:55.56]Where is the other one?
[69:59.19]We're on the complete opposite side.
[70:03.07]I'm going to dip.
[70:04.08]Yeah, fuck this.
[70:04.88]Let's get out of here.
[70:10.56]Yeah, it's too late.
[70:15.55]Happy birthday.
[70:16.57]Oh, happy birthday.
[70:17.43]He gets a birthday song.
[70:26.47]I don't know who it was.
[70:31.08]I never got a birthday song.
[70:43.02]Maybe this camp over here or is that too late?
[70:47.04]That hits for 200.
[70:47.86]OK.
[70:59.38]I want another bow.
[71:01.32]That's a bow.
[71:02.43]Yeah, it's a common misbegotten bow.
[71:07.61]That was probably up somebody's ass, OK?
[71:09.84]OK, now he now he doesn't want a bow anymore.
[71:12.62]It's a common bow.
[71:13.68]I hear a dung beetle immunity.
[71:23.30]It raises immunity.
[71:24.22]Nothing, nothing interesting.
[71:29.15]No, that's good, because we're fighting the demon boss.
[71:34.16]Would you like it?
[71:35.34]Because you are playing the character that needs to stay alive.
[71:38.74]It is on the ground, right on the marker.
[71:43.25]This other person is going to grab him.
[71:49.38]How do you do the jump attack?
[71:50.60]No, that's rot resistant.
[71:51.70]I thought you just meant immunity.
[71:53.89]Oh, I thought it said immunity.
[71:57.20]I just thought you meant the, like, generic status ailment stat.
[72:23.06]Ow.
[72:30.79]He's immune.
[72:32.42]Big stun.
[72:33.82]The boss is going to pick that talisman up.
[72:35.40]Wait.
[72:37.59]Oh shit.
[72:38.39]It's the nobles.
[72:54.07]Oh my God.
[72:55.17]That fucking thing takes a hundred years to happen.
[73:01.20]thank you you're good you're cute tell me whenever you ult or you're about to ult so I can time clock it
[73:35.75]Oh my god, I thought she was done.
[73:45.88]This long one hasn't attacked once yet.
[73:49.07]He's just walking around.
[73:50.95]That's good for us.
[74:10.66]I'm trying to do the damage to.
[74:20.59]Broly ball.
[74:21.47]OK, the person is taking care of the other one.
[74:25.46]Alright, I have my alt.
[74:28.30]Oh, I just used time clock.
[74:29.28]Don't use it yet.
[74:30.40]OK.
[74:31.49]I need like 3 seconds.
[74:33.63]I'm going to try to get them both.
[74:37.87]If I can.
[74:46.55]Are they both on you?
[74:47.82]Yes, they are.
[75:05.50]Let me know when you want me to use it.
[75:07.12]Whenever.
[75:08.04]I'm ready.
[75:08.29]I'm going to use it right now.
[75:17.55]that'll stun him where's the big one uh fighting the other person on the other side got a good split going here this person has not looked at me once
[75:44.71]I had heard that bow draws a lot of aggro, but it won't if you walk towards them while you shoot.
[75:49.89]Really?
[75:50.13]Rather than walk away.
[75:52.56]Well, it seems to be working out.
[75:54.70]Maybe we should... Should we hold out damage for a sec?
[75:56.98]I got no heals left, by the way.
[76:00.87]I have all mine.
[76:06.97]I'm not sure that they actually do the res thing.
[76:08.72]Even if they do, it should be fine because they don't res at full HP in the base game.
[76:17.58]Oh boy, oh boy.
[76:22.11]If I was a Souls boss, that would be my attack.
[76:24.19]I think I would be the fat noble.
[76:28.74]Or I wish I would be.
[76:34.59]One can dream.
[76:52.19]okay kill oh yeah like that looks fun that doesn't turn into a cheese wheel nice job hey we did it
[77:23.46]Night.
[77:29.57]Dude, we are champions of the sun.
[77:31.61]I've got major doubts on this one.
[77:33.94]This bow doesn't... I got a blue bow still, and it's kind of a piece of crap.
[77:40.69]But, hey, let's try it.
[77:44.17]Yeah...
[77:53.14]I'm gonna get a bunch of these.
[78:20.97]Okay.
[78:22.27]I guess this is the insanity one, right?
[78:25.35]Yeah.
[78:32.50]Maybe we'll do it.
[78:34.64]It's possible.
[78:36.57]Yeah, I have a... I have one madness cure in my inventory.
[78:44.86]Oh, I guess I should have used those.
[78:46.94]I wish I had a... I got like such weird equipment.
[78:52.61]I do too.
[78:53.57]I didn't have anything going on this time.
[78:58.61]Like, yeah, I have no cohesion.
[79:01.70]I just have a kind of a good.
[79:02.70]So should we not do this or should we take a buff?
[79:06.88]What did it?
[79:07.40]What was the debuff to you last time?
[79:09.04]Oh, he's just.
[79:10.06]He just.
[79:11.59]Can we?
[79:14.25]I chose no.
[79:15.27]I chose nothing.
[79:16.41]Refuse to make a deal.
[79:17.91]I mean, I wish to have great dexterity.
[79:19.47]Seems kind of insane on the archer.
[79:24.22]What was the bad?
[79:26.36]What did it do last time to you?
[79:28.54]I don't even know.
[79:33.94]I'll do it.
[79:34.95]Maybe it makes them cast more or something.
[79:44.96]I don't know.
[79:47.04]Alright, let's do it.
[79:49.18]Let's try to lock it in.
[80:01.41]I hope that hit.
[80:08.00]I don't think it did.
[80:12.48]I didn't realize he teleported that early.
[80:20.39]So yeah, last time these turrets, he was summoning more of them, but maybe, I don't know if that's like a phase two or more people chose buffs kind of thing.
[80:30.69]I'm dying.
[80:53.90]Yeah, I'm getting killed.
[80:56.10]I didn't even notice my health was lower.
[81:01.15]Pick up the shit.
[81:02.95]Oh my God.
[81:23.29]This guy is so annoying as a melee character.
[81:33.58]he is far away he teleported on me I was doing a little running every time you go to melee him there's a circle around him I get one attack
[82:06.89]Oh, no.
[82:10.48]I'm gonna get him.
[82:11.14]We gotta go through the thingies.
[82:18.81]That it?
[82:24.99]I'm gonna ult.
[82:34.05]Oh, fuck you, dude.
[82:36.44]That's a good thing you pinged him.
[82:38.26]Wasn't sure where he was.
[82:39.52]Why did that ping?
[82:42.97]Why did it ping?
[82:50.56]We're at like the edge of this map.
[82:52.48]I thought there was an edge.
[82:58.95]I'm going invisible to rez.
[83:06.39]I have no more heals.
[83:09.36]We still don't really have the damage.
[83:10.50]We didn't get any good weapons.
[83:28.85]We live another day.
[83:29.63]Madness.
[83:32.87]I don't think we're... Yeah, we can't get this.
[83:54.44]Dude, does anybody in the party even have a purple item?
[83:57.72]I think we all have like fucking grays and blues.
[84:03.51]I did.
[84:04.66]But it was like the weird Rancor mace.
[84:07.16]I don't know how good it was.
[84:09.98]Well, I got my objective.
[84:11.57]That's good.
[84:19.88]That was a good attempt, though.
[84:20.64]I mean, it's good to see it more than once.
[84:24.78]Yeah, we did really good against them last time.
[84:26.85]I think we just had...
[84:29.52]well one I think we had bad party composition with like double duchess and we still didn't get a lot I think we really we fumbled the sewer boss and we wasted a lot of time on day two yeah it's all good though yeah I think day two sewer boss is the angle I think uh is Vinny somebody said Vinny's almost ready wait for Vinny maybe let's see what's the status
[84:59.62]He said, almost ready.
[85:00.76]Okay.
[85:02.97]He said, is there a tutorial?
[85:05.27]There is a small tutorial.
[85:07.07]I type faster than you.
[85:07.83]I type faster.
[85:09.57]I type faster.
[85:14.02]Alright.
[85:14.40]I'm going to go pee.
[85:15.32]I'm going to get another drink.
[85:16.40]I'll be right back.
[85:17.90]Okay.
[85:18.94]We will get Vinny in the call.
[85:21.08]So when you drink all that, does the piss come out white?
[85:25.19]I don't want to hear this slander.
[85:26.57]Okay.
[85:26.85]That is...
[85:29.49]I have nothing.
[85:30.59]Be right back.
[91:00.02]Hello, everyone.
[91:02.55]Welcome back to Elden Ring, the land of Elden Ring.
[91:12.36]I agree.
[91:12.93]What mysteries will we find?
[91:20.02]Gather round.
[91:32.07]Play the bird and do a tank build.
[91:35.45]Birds seems good just because of the revive.
[91:37.63]Like, I think that... I like guard counters a lot.
[91:40.06]I might like him.
[91:41.78]But I think... I'd rather just swing wildly as the wilder.
[91:48.41]I get it.
[91:48.73]If I'm completely honest.
[91:50.31]You need to do the wilder quest.
[91:51.67]He gets good stuff.
[91:52.57]I know.
[91:53.62]Let me do it.
[91:54.78]What even is it?
[91:56.64]You just have to go into, like, the Smithing Stone tunnel.
[92:02.76]and you get a slab is it a cut and you're like done uh sort of so you like go into a remembrance and you have to talk to people around it's like what your personal character story is in the roundhold table okay and like this the corners of the screen get a little misty yeah but you know the flashback okay so I just gonna have to talk to people do you need help with something
[92:30.59]help me remember oh dude her item is really good the golden dew I'm just opening up the game guide I don't I don't care talking to people lore
[92:58.30]so if you go to the map it shows you where the person is you have to go talk to with a there's like an actual quest marker oh and the journal will update with what your next thing is after you do everything yeah the technology is finally there in the goofball Dark soulslike yeah lore more like leave out really excruciating
[93:29.40]yeah it took me a while to think about that one I've been since you started talking a minute ago two minutes ago I've been thinking of a l-o-r-e inviolable duty to keep everyone I'm afraid there's very little life left in the story you have a discerning eye would you be willing to hunt one down for me well I'm sorry that happened to you marvelous I advise you to make your way okay yeah mining tunnel passageways are there are
[93:59.22]Cool.
[93:59.68]Okay.
[94:05.01]So I have a question for you.
[94:07.91]Is the mist going to stay on the screen until I finish this?
[94:11.61]Yes.
[94:12.16]Yeah.
[94:12.54]It is?
[94:13.92]Yeah.
[94:14.96]Well, not in the mission.
[94:16.40]Oh, I was going to say that's fucking terrible.
[94:19.79]Oh, you don't like delirium fog?
[94:21.63]You're one of those people?
[94:22.39]I don't know what that is.
[94:28.43]Let me make sure my shit's good.
[94:35.62]A lot of dex.
[94:36.34]I'll keep it.
[94:38.28]Oh, I got, by the way, people that are like, what the hell?
[94:40.38]What is he doing?
[94:41.04]Wasn't he a red guy?
[94:43.68]I got the other goblet.
[94:44.89]I want to try dex.
[94:53.50]He used to be red.
[94:59.41]Now he just gets red.
[95:02.27]When you wipe your glasses with your shirt, but it just makes the glasses smudgier.
[95:06.04]Yeah, that's true.
[95:11.10]And then you have to get up.
[95:12.29]You have to go get the alcohol lens wipes.
[95:15.09]You have to sit there for five minutes.
[95:16.65]And then somehow you add streaks to it.
[95:20.98]Then you got to get up, get a soft cloth, wipe the alcohol wipe residue off.
[95:28.66]Wait, I missed.
[95:29.44]Are we talking about, like, cleaning up a crime scene?
[95:31.92]And then, and then finally, it's all done.
[95:35.03]You've got everything completed.
[95:36.25]The glasses are clean.
[95:37.15]And then you somehow, absentmindedly, touch the front of them or put a greasy-ass fingerprint right on the top.
[95:45.89]And it makes you want to scream.
[95:47.76]And all your hard work is gone.
[95:58.30]That's a Family Guy bit.
[96:00.31]No, it is not.
[96:01.09]That's not.
[96:01.57]That didn't happen.
[96:02.31]Peter Griffin has glasses on in Family Guy.
[96:11.14]It's kind of my role model.
[96:19.21]In the newer episodes of Family Guy, I feel like Peter doesn't do the as much as he used to.
[96:28.88]probably true he's matured is the same uh is it the same for SpongeBob what's like the average yes over time for these kinds of characters like at a certain point do they just say we've done it enough
[96:52.90]Okay, do you think that per episode average, because I don't know, there probably is more episodes of Family Guy than SpongeBob at this point, but the per episode average of Peter Griffin versus... Do you think the per episode average, who is higher?
[97:10.40]SpongeBob or Peter Griffin?
[97:12.44]I will let you know I'm doing my thesis on this.
[97:19.96]SpongeBob actually clears that SpongeBob by a mile really wait you know what that's actually true because there are whole swaths of an episode where SpongeBob is doing that for like a full minute straight and I think Peter quit yeah I don't think they ever make Peter's laugh a plot point
[97:48.57]I think they do at least once or twice haven't they I don't know there's probably like 17 seasons I haven't seen family guys getting up there it's kind of like uh the Pokémon games like after Pokémon red and blue none of it's real to me so it's just like there's only a few early uh seasons before it's all just not real anymore
[98:18.62]Somebody said, I'll take.
[98:21.46]There's no way the world just suddenly discovered like 500 additional Pokémon were walking around that they didn't know about when they already knew about the fossil Pokémon.
[98:32.48]That's some pretty in-depth like archaeology.
[98:35.89]And then they're like, wait a minute, there's a monkey one too.
[98:38.63]I'm not buying it.
[98:42.42]Somebody said they're in other countries.
[98:48.07]no there are 150 Pokémon and you have to collect them all not collect this segment not collect like wait for DLC 150 Pokémon collected them all yeah it is gotta catch them all at that point they are even at the stage of like cloning sheep and making Mewtwo there is a genetically engineered Pokémon and they're like wait a minute this other continent we had no idea
[99:12.57]Hey, but does the technology exist in the Pokémon world?
[99:17.01]Do boats exist?
[99:18.23]Have they found other continents and stuff?
[99:20.14]Is that what's going on?
[99:22.00]They're finding another continent.
[99:24.04]And, oh, we discovered America or something.
[99:26.30]And look, there's another continent and there's like 500 Pokémon on it.
[99:30.41]I've played an hour of Pokémon in my whole life.
[99:32.37]Can you imagine cloning a woman to run every inn in America?
[99:36.53]And then one day going, holy shit, Europe exists.
[99:48.78]I'm not buying it.
[99:49.99]The song says there's 150 or more.
[99:52.89]I don't remember that being part of the ads.
[99:57.05]Gotta catch them all.
[99:58.70]Or more.
[99:59.02]There might be more.
[100:00.86]Pokémon.
[100:02.00]Gotta catch them all.
[100:03.92]Or more.
[100:05.44]Like asterisk and fine print.
[100:08.01]There's going to be more later.
[100:09.21]Gotta catch them all.
[100:10.49]So far.
[100:13.05]That's actually funny.
[100:21.45]Hey, how long does it take to die to the Fel Omen twice in the tutorial, Vinny?
[100:24.94]Where we at?
[100:29.98]We've reserved the right to introduce new Pokémon to the world at any time.
[100:51.05]uh if you were a Pokémon what would your magic type be my magic type my like elemental yeah leaning um shadow mine would be someone this is not a real type is that not real physical attack damage
[101:24.58]What's ghastly?
[101:26.80]Dark?
[101:34.87]Fighting type.
[101:36.36]Normal type.
[101:38.36]Yeah, fighting normal type is pretty good.
[101:44.96]Normal gas type.
[101:46.79]Yeah, ghastly.
[101:47.75]Normal ghastly.
[101:53.22]They need to put, like, a CS:GO surf map in the round table for when you're waiting for people.
[102:01.57]It has to be a Jump King map over here.
[102:03.77]Yeah, I'm, like, jumping around the swords on the round table, and that's the best I've got, is, like, trying to get these jumps in.
[102:09.58]Yeah, imagine just launching over here and just skiing.
[102:12.10]There's a huge only-up map over here.
[102:16.51]That would be great.
[102:17.45]That would be actually kind of amazing.
[102:19.61]It would get a lot of use.
[102:21.70]That's like the new loading screen technology.
[102:26.01]Or put a blackjack table in?
[102:27.97]Yeah, that's true.
[102:31.06]Oh yeah, if you could blackjack gamble your runes.
[102:35.16]Speaking of that, I got some of that to do right now.
[102:42.75]Ends the stream and goes to the strip.
[102:47.10]Without saying a word.
[102:48.84]Nah.
[102:50.68]Alright, we can do five.
[102:52.22]What are they?
[102:52.72]I'm really just jumping all the swords.
[103:02.54]This is not terrible.
[103:16.73]If Ster and Vinny were in your chat, how often do you think they would be timed out?
[103:20.06]Oh, they would have... They'd have immunity.
[103:22.76]I found out that I'm also not welcome in Vinny's chat.
[103:26.09]Well, see, streamers... Okay, here's the thing.
[103:27.71]Streamers that come over are almost like in their own streamer embassy.
[103:31.65]Right?
[103:31.85]So it's like... I cannot ban Ster because he's part of Ster's embassy over here.
[103:38.26]So I can't ban him.
[103:40.77]My very first message in Vinny's chat was auto-timed out.
[103:45.81]Okay.
[103:51.36]What if they weren't streamers?
[103:54.51]It depends on how funny they were.
[104:00.06]There's been some rotten comments that have come through.
[104:02.88]That have been kind of funny.
[104:04.77]But then there's been the other, let's call it 500 million.
[104:08.55]That are just like, bro, fucking shut up.
[104:12.38]You know what I'm saying?
[104:13.52]You gotta be funny.
[104:21.45]Like, if you come in and you say something kind of like, yeah, whoa, dude, what the fuck was that?
[104:26.84]Alright, whatever.
[104:27.48]But if it's like, whoa, hold on a second.
[104:29.50]That was kind of fucked up.
[104:30.46]But hold on a minute there.
[104:31.40]You're making me think.
[104:32.92]And what you said was kind of funny.
[104:42.33]Adding binning to the call.
[104:44.78]Cool.
[104:53.65]guys I made it hey how you doing you can just join me on steam and you'll be in the lobby I believe I'm gonna fail are you guys like level 20. no there's no levels the game is very difficult there's no levels it's just very hard and it's fun with your friends
[105:16.82]okay yeah there's a lot of you're gonna be overwhelmed at all for a run or two we are not gonna it's not gonna be like Vinny over here oh my god Vinny we're gonna make sure we're gonna go slow we'll do it for fun we're not gonna be fucking try hard so we're gonna be fun I want to be fun too I'm so I'm ready okay so there's a a bird with armor there's like an anthropomorphic bird is okay
[105:46.70]We can explain the characters to you.
[105:49.61]What do you want to play as?
[105:51.45]What's your typical Souls play style?
[105:56.57]Horror.
[105:57.67]No, I can kill enemies.
[105:59.80]I killed Bael on my first try, so how do I kill?
[106:03.04]What would be good to round out this party?
[106:05.00]Are you a magic or melee, slow, big swings, fast, little swings?
[106:11.25]What's your style?
[106:13.27]I like any kind of melee in a game like this.
[106:16.82]Okay, maybe you should play the Wilder because Wilder is all around really great.
[106:20.57]It's probably my favorite character, but I can play Mage.
[106:23.79]And I think no matter what on Birdman, you'll be useful because his ult reses people as well.
[106:29.72]I could be Bird.
[106:31.46]Bird is good, but Bird is you need to do a lot of guarding and I didn't love Bird as a melee.
[106:38.23]You don't need to.
[106:39.51]You just get a two-hander.
[106:42.86]Are there more characters that unlock as you go?
[106:45.60]There's two extras.
[106:48.58]Oh.
[106:50.26]Maybe I'll try Raider.
[106:55.10]Yeah, he's good.
[106:58.35]Yeah, no risk this guy.
[106:59.49]They all have like their own scaling too and they all find weapons related.
[107:03.55]So like you'll find more great swords on Raider and he has like better scaling with them.
[107:09.02]OK.
[107:09.22]OK, is there anything else I should be doing in the round table or?
[107:15.19]Not yet.
[107:16.80]I think you need to like do a run.
[107:19.14]I'm ready then.
[107:19.70]Yeah, you gotta get one under your belt.
[107:24.84]What is it?
[107:25.32]This guy's got a big belt, so I mean, so I mean I'm ready.
[107:31.97]Alright, let's do it.
[107:33.97]Alright.
[107:36.09]So anyhow, it kind of works is we we get dropped off the bus.
[107:41.90]We Oh God land wherever.
[107:44.49]Tomato Town?
[107:45.57]There is a kind of like a Tomato Town.
[107:48.94]Tomato Town's a little harder.
[107:50.16]I think Fortnite's a little bit more difficult of a game.
[107:51.84]So there's a little bit more of a challenge factor on Tomato Town.
[107:56.42]But when we land, we kind of have to just, we got like 40 minutes to do whatever.
[108:02.15]We have to kill a boss.
[108:03.83]There's a day two.
[108:05.52]We got to kill another boss and then we go right into it.
[108:08.60]The final boss of the evening.
[108:10.96]Why am I getting -2?
[108:12.22]What the fuck are you talking about?
[108:17.62]You just need to ready at the round table.
[108:22.04]Okay, you know what?
[108:22.68]I'm going to do that, but I'm also going to switch to bird.
[108:25.47]My chat is like, Vin, you might enjoy bird.
[108:27.51]So bird sounds good to me.
[108:29.07]You can pick it after you're ready.
[108:31.52]You can?
[108:32.52]Yeah.
[108:34.70]Sorry, I'm sneezing a little bit, and I really need you to have that information as soon as possible.
[108:39.73]I didn't know you were.
[108:41.33]It's cool.
[108:41.73]I thought it was a bit.
[108:42.69]It was like a comedy.
[108:43.55]No, it was a really big sneeze.
[108:46.34]Comedic?
[108:49.53]um so you're gonna bird up I'm gonna bird up alright germans gonna magician bird up when we take when we die we're gonna go down your bird up ultimate can revive us wait the bird can't roll the bird cannot roll it's more of a wait I didn't know that either what it's more of a shimmy velden pert
[109:17.98]I like that name.
[109:20.26]Thank you.
[109:20.74]I came up with it just a minute ago.
[109:25.57]I was like, chat, what is the most elderly lord style name?
[109:30.58]That's a pretty elderly one.
[109:33.56]Melpert is a nickname of mine.
[109:35.54]So Veldenpert just felt right.
[109:40.95]I just asked chat what my name was and they said Ster.
[109:43.24]So I did that.
[109:44.74]Star.
[109:46.63]So we're landing somewhere.
[109:50.69]We got a double church.
[109:51.42]You really don't really get to choose.
[109:53.00]This implies you get to fly.
[109:54.46]You really don't.
[109:55.56]Yeah, you really don't.
[109:56.10]I was trying to fly.
[109:57.82]Yeah.
[110:00.48]So we need pro tip.
[110:02.53]Vinny, Vinny, come on.
[110:04.25]I'm just kidding.
[110:05.85]What?
[110:06.85]Like, alright.
[110:10.83]We're trying to get...
[110:14.05]3600 souls is your first level up okay and then you can touch a grace because you have like no life at level one also we prefer uh there's like all the objectives on the map have different very specific rewards we're kind of church pilled around here because you get more flasks from churches okay yeah flash charges it's in the top left his green marker is is a church we'll probably we can probably clear this place and then go to the church
[110:41.90]Okay.
[110:43.02]You're the church.
[110:43.80]Thank you for waiting for me, by the way.
[110:45.12]I appreciate that.
[110:46.18]I know you guys were just hanging out.
[110:47.44]Well, you weren't doing duos, were you?
[110:49.77]No, it's... It has to be duos.
[110:51.57]You have to do threes.
[110:53.61]So we just match made a third.
[110:56.58]They were no Vinny.
[110:59.10]We invited them in a voice.
[111:00.50]They were not funny.
[111:02.67]Oh.
[111:03.65]Well, I can relate to that.
[111:07.75]Yeah, so it's all about kind of just get runes early on here.
[111:13.06]Okay.
[111:14.21]Alright, so we spend some time farming.
[111:16.77]Opening chests like this.
[111:17.65]Before the circle comes in.
[111:19.09]There.
[111:19.44]Oh, we got a storm sword key.
[111:21.86]Now, is this all our own loot, or we share it?
[111:25.33]Shared.
[111:25.69]We share it.
[111:26.73]When we beat a boss, there'll be like an orb, and everybody gets an orb.
[111:30.29]So Vinny, this halberd, anything that you have equipped, doesn't matter what it is and what slot it's in, you will get the passive of whatever the passive says.
[111:39.31]So this halberd right here, you will get this bonus as long as it's in your inventory.
[111:45.71]Should I do it?
[111:46.57]You should absolutely take it, especially if it has anything on it.
[111:51.24]Okay.
[111:53.55]And it says improved incantations and determination.
[111:57.43]Oh, improved incantations.
[111:58.59]I see.
[111:59.01]Okay.
[111:59.51]Yeah.
[111:59.63]Even if you don't use it, it's just there's no reason not to have it on.
[112:03.34]Cool.
[112:03.82]Got it.
[112:04.28]That's awesome.
[112:04.88]So you're trying to make the best... I'm going right to the church, by the way.
[112:09.13]Same.
[112:10.27]You're trying to make the best possible kind of passives with whatever drops.
[112:15.25]Sometimes you get pretty good shit.
[112:17.57]I wouldn't worry too much about it, though, because a lot of times it's just random.
[112:20.40]It's like, oh, plus 10% sorceries.
[112:22.36]It's like, whatever.
[112:26.99]Um, I've, I've lost sight of you lads.
[112:29.96]Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[112:30.38]Go into the green marker.
[112:32.96]Um, is there fall damage?
[112:35.42]No.
[112:35.50]There is no fall damage.
[112:39.75]We got a random boss.
[112:41.77]I don't know if we should do this yet.
[112:43.05]I need to, let's get, I want to level up.
[112:46.88]Yeah, uh, Vinny, leveling up, it just happens automatically.
[112:49.62]You don't have to put in points and do this and do that.
[112:52.03]You just have to level up.
[112:54.27]Okay.
[112:55.66]I recommend we do it you guys want to fight this um thing here yeah I got a level um oh you're um oh I thought you were doing the wilder quest let's go into the cave add charge maybe try and wait for Vinny yeah are there any negatives zero no it just gives you another like a time base trying to get as many buffs as you can really I see
[113:20.71]So we're trying to hustle is all.
[113:24.04]Then he's here.
[113:25.54]Yeah, because we're going in the cave.
[113:28.07]It is much faster than it seems for the circle to start closing.
[113:37.14]Did you tell them you died in the tutorial?
[113:39.57]No, they don't need to know that.
[113:41.83]Vinny, don't worry.
[113:42.83]We actually all beat it first try.
[113:44.31]I didn't even get through the tutorial.
[113:47.76]I died to the first enemy.
[113:49.74]Oh.
[113:50.58]Yeah, it was bad.
[113:53.53]I died to the rot.
[113:54.97]Like, you know, when in Fortnite, the map closes in on you.
[113:59.34]I died to that.
[114:00.04]I was like, oh, no, that's intentional.
[114:01.86]Oh, yeah, the rot consumes?
[114:03.72]Yeah.
[114:04.92]does that happen when we're playing the map shrinks or is that it does yeah this makes you invisible like even if you attack you'll be invisible for a while just trying just trying to like absolutely info dump you that's okay info dump me and I will be good at game that's how it works oh
[114:33.81]Excellent.
[114:34.31]Alright.
[114:36.41]Okay.
[114:36.89]Everybody gets one of these.
[114:37.97]These are the good things you want of like buffs.
[114:40.66]Spitting Stone 2.
[114:41.92]Hell yeah.
[114:48.23]I got a Scorpion Kite Shield.
[114:49.93]Minimum level.
[114:50.79]Oh, there's minimum levels too.
[114:52.37]Okay.
[114:53.59]I got a Stone Sword Key.
[114:55.33]I have one too.
[114:57.10]Ooh.
[114:59.56]How do I pick it up?
[115:01.64]Oh, why?
[115:03.92]And then you get to pick one in there.
[115:05.56]Oh, you get to pick one?
[115:07.10]Yeah.
[115:12.65]I see, but I have to also trade an item.
[115:15.10]We're going to have to get moving here in a minute.
[115:17.98]Alright, I'm ready.
[115:19.46]There is another church here that I need to get before we leave, so I'm going to get the hell out of here right now.
[115:27.87]Yep.
[115:31.45]I'm still struggling on the items a little bit.
[115:34.34]It is weird.
[115:34.96]It is weird.
[115:35.42]Especially because you have to go so quickly.
[115:37.11]It's like, what the fuck is this?
[115:38.53]I guess I'm going to take that.
[115:40.49]Yeah.
[115:44.58]Pretty much, if the number is higher and it has decent stats, then just use it.
[115:51.07]Okay.
[115:52.34]I'll just follow you.
[115:55.27]That's a generally good thing to do in this.
[115:58.83]Uh, can I?
[116:00.57]Touch high number.
[116:01.63]Am I screwed here?
[116:02.23]No, I mean, like, just follow people.
[116:04.10]There we go.
[116:04.74]Get up that way.
[116:05.44]Oh, oh, oh.
[116:10.63]Slayer Jeremy!
[116:11.41]Fuck!
[116:12.05]Ooh!
[116:13.41]Is the treasure chest up here?
[116:15.49]Okay.
[116:16.51]That's yours.
[116:18.94]Oh, star, star.
[116:19.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[116:21.16]Hmm.
[116:21.74]I found you.
[116:22.60]Okay.
[116:23.63]Oh.
[116:24.57]Oh, you're still down here.
[116:25.35]Okay.
[116:25.67]Yeah, I was pressed the wrong button to jump.
[116:27.95]I'm playing Fantasy Life, and every button is different.
[116:31.82]Fuck, how do I get out of here?
[116:36.26]Uh... There's two ways out.
[116:37.14]You might have to keep going.
[116:40.25]I leveled up several times.
[116:43.37]Okay, then there's another church up here we're gonna go get.
[116:46.00]Vineyard.
[116:47.06]Yes.
[116:47.68]Vineyard Vines.
[116:48.96]Yeah, any time you can level, definitely try to...
[116:52.24]Are we killing this goat?
[116:55.18]What is that?
[116:55.82]A stag?
[116:56.42]We don't have time because the circle's coming in.
[116:59.21]Oh, I see.
[117:00.17]Okay.
[117:01.05]Boy, I... Boy.
[117:03.04]Yeah, so you kind of want to start at the edge of the map and, like, work your way in so you don't, like, lose the stuff at the edge.
[117:08.93]Oh.
[117:09.01]Because all the churches are always at the edge.
[117:10.73]Yeah, we're safe right here.
[117:13.19]So we got to get that church.
[117:16.23]Uh, Vinny, I got something good for you.
[117:18.85]I think.
[117:19.46]Okay.
[117:20.66]What about this?
[117:21.14]Should we kill this thing or no?
[117:23.60]Pretty much just you can, but.
[117:26.76]Just keep running.
[117:28.05]It's best to get to an objective that you want to get to first and then be like, okay, what are we killing?
[117:32.77]Okay.
[117:36.34]I like the new parkour mechanics.
[117:37.78]That's cool.
[117:39.54]I had to use my horse for that previously, so this is good.
[117:42.76]Alright, Vinny, come here.
[117:43.81]I got something for you.
[117:45.67]Yep.
[117:46.52]it's pretty good great shield talisman oh nice somebody is throwing pots just be careful I'm just running to the church over the bridge yeah I need to increase my camera speed too at some point but yeah in between rounds and motion blur off if it's on I did immediately yeah my chat like stinks they just get sick whenever it's on they're like no you didn't turn it off
[118:17.15]um we can uh I don't know if we have time for that because it's on the edge we can go more center to the cat let's go castle and kill like all the crucible knights and stuff yeah the pot throwers the castle's kind of kind of rough but it is worth doing alright
[118:44.47]start using my shield okay that's that's a thing did you guys how did you play Elden Ring like what was your main build uh scimitar jumping attack bleed I did a lot of sorcery sorcery and then probably like a dex generic dex build okay
[119:05.73]yeah I was like kind of all over the place like two hands one hand big okay watch out for these gigantic pots oh my god I forgot and I I knew they were there that um that Smithing Stone to go down there early it seems really good because that immediately gets you a purple weapon
[119:21.06]I have a good Smithing Stone right now I just don't know if I want to use it on this particular item I'm going you jump up this these stairs over here I'm going to fight these guys but I would like to wait for someone and I will make us invisible and we will run in I'm almost here too I'm just learning to parkour yeah that one's weird it has like a big guy wall yeah
[119:51.62]That was not helpful.
[119:58.50]Watch out, there's other guys that are throwing pots.
[120:00.81]It's not just him.
[120:07.20]Oh shit, there are people throwing shit.
[120:09.82]This is like, wow, okay.
[120:11.60]There's a lot of bad shit here.
[120:13.44]I'm down.
[120:13.68]I kind of forgot how much this sucks.
[120:19.66]Over this way, sure.
[120:21.44]Yeah, he's gonna do it that way at Wackby a few times.
[120:32.00]Oh my god, dude.
[120:32.34]Oh, I'm down.
[120:32.96]It's a nightmare up here.
[120:34.28]No I'm not, no I'm not.
[120:35.86]I just want to kill this guy and run.
[120:37.89]Fucking pot!
[120:42.15]Where even is the pot guy?
[120:43.21]Can we just like shoot him?
[120:44.21]Up on the other castle.
[120:48.87]I'm going to fucking die to the ground.
[120:52.68]Oh, yeah.
[120:53.96]I don't have very many souls.
[120:54.98]I don't have very many souls.
[120:55.86]I'm dead.
[121:04.01]That's not good.
[121:04.83]Oh, boy.
[121:10.05]Oh, I died.
[121:11.11]Yeah, I don't know if I'm ever going to do that ever again.
[121:13.60]I think it's just the circles coming in.
[121:18.86]three attacking was just well that's what I mean that that always happens I always forget that you like are not I'm gonna die right now I think we're screwed here dude dude dude what do we do I'm scared we just gotta run through and try to heal I only had one flask you're gonna have to get me up
[121:45.00]Damn it, we're fucked.
[121:45.78]Just leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me.
[121:49.71]It's gonna take too long to leave him.
[121:50.77]Leave me.
[121:53.23]Oh, I still have no flask when you get... Yeah, okay.
[121:55.57]This was... You have a first run with Vinny, you know?
[121:58.70]Hey, first run.
[121:59.24]Sorry.
[121:59.38]A lot of information.
[122:01.48]It's honestly my bad.
[122:02.14]Where am I going?
[122:03.12]Where am I going?
[122:04.82]The pots just fucked us.
[122:06.21]It was just like... Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[122:09.13]My bad for even calling to go to those pots.
[122:15.81]what's the permanent progression if there's any like in between runs you get these relics you can equip on your character that you'll you'll get after this okay
[122:38.63]Hey, we might.
[122:39.53]What if we pull it out?
[122:40.71]What if we pull it through?
[122:42.77]We could.
[122:44.56]This is the lowest level I've been for the first boss.
[122:46.88]I'm stuck in another hole.
[122:50.90]Gonna try.
[123:01.62]Jump up here.
[123:02.38]I am kind of up here.
[123:04.08]I'm level three.
[123:06.84]Yeah, same.
[123:08.39]No, I don't like that that's bound to that.
[123:17.08]I mean, that's good.
[123:18.48]Probably should grab that too Vinny.
[123:21.28]It's just another talisman.
[123:23.39]You guys are going to get trapped.
[123:25.07]Oh, we're kind of fucked already.
[123:28.01]Uh oh.
[123:34.26]Leaving the area.
[123:35.45]As quickly as possible.
[123:40.07]God, the fucking stuff moves quick, doesn't it?
[123:42.88]It does.
[123:43.80]I think we're dead, Vinny.
[123:47.10]Maybe not.
[123:50.11]No, we got this.
[123:50.89]We got this.
[123:54.94]It's a fuckface run.
[123:55.86]It's alright.
[123:58.18]Tutorial.
[123:58.76]Advanced extended tutorial.
[124:07.78]We could pull this out of our ass right now though.
[124:09.34]It's possible.
[124:13.99]Why is it up there?
[124:16.77]Oops.
[124:20.17]Hey, at least I did a cool thing.
[124:21.69]Is there a way to get mana back without doing that wrong move?
[124:28.06]Or do you have to- You need items.
[124:30.62]There's a lot of items that are like mana on hit, FP on hit.
[124:48.18]Alright, can three level threes beat this boss?
[124:51.46]Oh, yeah.
[124:52.57]Let's do it.
[124:54.91]I believe in us.
[125:06.20]Oh, yeah.
[125:07.34]Do my ult!
[125:08.08]Oh, you have three... You're hard to rez.
[125:13.63]Right.
[125:14.47]Right, because I've been down... Died three times, you have three ticks.
[125:18.62]Which is why Birdman's ult is so good, because I'm never going to get you guys.
[125:23.34]Just let him kill you.
[125:25.50]So the Birdman ult... Will revive people no matter how many ticks they have.
[125:30.21]Oh, so that's not an offensive spell.
[125:32.55]Okay.
[125:35.04]I mean I think it's both I'm not sure I haven't played him okay I think it gives like a defense or revives and maybe you hit when you land it's all good just yeah see you now efficient back and forth exactly I just skipped it I didn't even want to see it
[126:02.70]so you get the that's where you get the relics and you get the resource to buy relics from the pot guy in the library let's see um how do I equip okay I'll just go to the relic dude I'm gonna try um the wilder again or because I don't think I'm good with bird
[126:18.98]Wilder is, I think, my favorite class.
[126:22.01]Just all around good.
[126:22.65]You have a grapple hook that it has a tiny cooldown.
[126:27.99]And you can pull little enemies to you.
[126:30.72]But the best part about it is bosses.
[126:33.00]Because you do it and you just zip line right to the boss.
[126:36.78]It's great for moving around.
[126:38.91]Cool.
[126:39.03]And the ult is just a gigantic bomb.
[126:44.78]Oh, I see how this works with the relics.
[126:46.63]Some classes can equip some and not others.
[126:49.62]Oh.
[126:50.36]Yeah.
[126:51.40]Yeah.
[126:54.87]Spend Merc to buy.
[126:56.86]That's a great name for a currency.
[127:00.43]I can't buy anything except like a gesture of like me failing like I can buy like I have failed that's awesome save up buddy yeah gambling you end up you can buy them individually or you can just gamble and gambling is just oh maybe you'll get a rare one it's pretty sweet okay
[127:24.96]expedition you know what I'll just ready up I'm just gonna ready up I'm I'm doing support lady and I've got the flasks heal my allies thing remember to change camera speed oh is there a way to change camera distance too I don't think so I think it's locked yeah alright um I would like to go down into the Smithing Stone cave again because I want to upgrade my base weapon her base weapon's like really good
[127:57.55]alright I'm gonna lock in this time oh shit we're we're like this is not a fuck face run this is a wizard revenant run are we screwed we're gonna no we're gonna do great oh good they're not they're not melee characters alright I also have like a free revival how long did you guys play last night by the way oh god
[128:28.35]it was a while Jeremy kept playing after stream I think I had like you say you want to go right this cave 10 hours played uh let's level up quick and then I want to go in the cave for the stones okay let's go alright we're taking out some bozos for early levels the ghost guy is my guy
[128:55.26]early levels oh I was wondering what you meant okay you have you have like a bunch of freaks got it I'm like there's like a summoner class that'll last guard breaking someone should take that you wilder man should take that x and then we level up when we're going to the cave should be able to do it once right now yep
[129:22.18]And then which cave?
[129:23.34]That one over there?
[129:24.86]Closest one.
[129:25.42]I marked it.
[129:30.01]But yeah, it's a very fast-paced game.
[129:31.57]It's a lot to take in.
[129:32.55]So I thought we were going to have time to, I don't know, talk or anything.
[129:37.90]This game gets you into the infinite, like, no, we're running here now, guys.
[129:41.00]Come on.
[129:41.91]Yeah, like immediate.
[129:43.29]This is not a great game to talk about.
[129:44.89]Our favorite pita breads.
[129:48.07]You got to lock in.
[129:49.43]You like jelly or jam?
[129:51.15]Let's talk about the finer differences.
[129:59.25]Wait, I jumped.
[130:00.83]I did a bad jump.
[130:02.38]I did a bad jump, guys.
[130:03.62]No, the jump was good.
[130:04.56]Yeah, you're good.
[130:05.44]You had to jump down.
[130:06.09]Jump was good.
[130:07.69]Oh.
[130:07.97]Oh.
[130:17.02]Alright.
[130:18.62]Feel way better about that jump now.
[130:21.87]I don't know what it is with her, like what allows me to get ghosts of the things that I killed, but this is like, we're like a six man party.
[130:30.52]It's kind of crazy.
[130:32.28]It's good.
[130:34.15]I should probably just like go solo with her in a group.
[130:37.99]She seems like she can split up well.
[130:40.57]Also, next time you guys are hurt, let me test the my flasks heal allies thing and see how much you get.
[130:45.54]Okay.
[130:46.00]Apparently they're doing a patch for this to make solo play less bad.
[130:51.93]From what I've seen and what I've heard from people is that solo seems easier.
[131:00.47]oh my god that was not a backstab okay I'm out of fucking mana punch punch
[131:24.17]I'm here.
[131:25.27]Sorry.
[131:47.36]Alright, alright.
[131:51.20]damn alright okay good I just wanted the Smithing Stone and we can work it on here alright let's get out oh that's your guy again let me heal you Jerma see how this works or no I got any health where are you I don't know where we're going you need to come up oh up up and we're leaving it's so hard to get my bearings
[132:16.63]yeah I I still have no idea where anything is everything there's so much verticality there's so much up and down I think we're going this way the orb Vinny did I not grab the stone you have to click twice weirdly with that one to place the stone in your inventory should I go back and get it yes I think there's still time alright I'll meet up with you guys in a minute
[132:45.50]salmon I haven't had a chance to level but we should be fine with 700 summons um night tide grows stronger what does that mean enemies it's starting to move this is just such a shock that this is the direction they went in with with multiplayer elden it's so weird it is very odd but it's fun
[133:14.07]Everything's so much faster and everything's harder, but... It's harder because it's faster.
[133:21.08]Like, you just have to be ready.
[133:22.64]Like, what am I doing?
[133:23.25]What am I doing?
[133:24.51]Right.
[133:27.91]I need mana.
[133:38.05]Dog.
[133:40.69]we're in the circle here alright um where's the level thing yeah I need uh I need we gotta we gotta level up we're like grace that's the closest one let's do it and then we could go not fight pot guys in the castle but hopefully crucible night guys oh I'm gonna try the heel thing
[134:10.82]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[134:12.20]Oh yeah, that's just like a... How far away?
[134:16.59]Can you do that from far away?
[134:17.65]Oh, I have no more flasks to try.
[134:22.19]I don't know.
[134:22.61]That was pretty close when I tried it.
[134:27.42]Speaking of flasks, we could use another one.
[134:30.16]You want to get this one while we have a chance?
[134:34.22]Oh yeah, maybe.
[134:35.11]I only got three.
[134:35.71]Where is it?
[134:36.17]It's below it.
[134:40.00]I don't know.
[134:40.30]I'd rather spend the time leveling.
[134:43.35]Alright, whatever you guys need to do, I trust you.
[134:49.52]It's another pot guy one.
[134:50.48]It's another pot guy one.
[134:52.41]This is not as bad.
[134:53.91]Alright, here we go.
[135:13.82]Okay.
[135:17.32]Oh!
[135:18.39]I don't even think that worked.
[135:19.53]Oh boy.
[135:27.48]Oh!
[135:27.68]Get out of the way, man!
[135:31.05]Jesus!
[135:32.73]Stunned!
[135:35.88]Good.
[135:37.12]Nice work.
[135:40.04]the orb night comet I want this uh treasure chest here some stuff a bow and yeah he kind of hits the wall with those we probably have more levels as well
[135:58.30]Rotten crystal snap.
[136:00.70]Damage negation.
[136:01.89]Probably want that.
[136:05.65]Going down.
[136:07.52]We're heading down.
[136:08.48]Vinny to the bottom.
[136:11.54]Just to let you know where we are.
[136:13.49]Got it.
[136:13.77]Let's go to the church.
[136:17.30]I think we have to go up this right wall and over the bridge.
[136:20.04]I'm starting to learn the map.
[136:23.48]Oh, man.
[136:24.82]Yeah, they don't mess around when they throw shit at you, huh?
[136:27.76]Yeah, it's awful.
[136:28.27]No.
[136:34.53]Did you just heal yourself, Vinny?
[136:36.24]I had to, yeah.
[136:36.96]I was about to get hit with a pot.
[136:37.82]I'm just trying to see how far the blast thing works.
[136:40.22]Let's let your health go up right after I use mine.
[136:43.71]Are you good?
[136:44.67]Am I jumping up here?
[136:45.43]Yeah, I'm good.
[136:46.45]Up the wall, and then we're taking the bridge over to this church.
[136:52.87]Get a flask.
[136:57.12]I'm right behind you guys.
[137:01.59]Oh, thank God.
[137:02.07]There's a Grace right there.
[137:05.25]I love you, Vinny.
[137:05.75]You're doing great.
[137:07.03]Thanks, man.
[137:10.64]Not as good as you climbing in that game, White Knuckle, but, you know, doing alright.
[137:16.67]Yeah.
[137:19.33]You better play.
[137:20.58]I said it in your chat that I will love you more if you get to Act 3.
[137:23.66]I'm not going to, but I'll play it.
[137:25.74]You will earn points.
[137:28.77]You'll get to Act 3.
[137:29.73]I need the points.
[137:30.87]I need social credit with you, sir.
[137:33.28]This is the game that you want us to play?
[137:35.76]White Knuckle, yeah, I would love to watch you play it.
[137:37.82]But you can't quit.
[137:39.21]I can't quit.
[137:41.34]I mean you'll have to quit like eventually I'm not saying you like you have to play it for your whole life okay but if you play for like 30 minutes I'm gonna be really like I'm not gonna talk to you for a week they sent me a key to it the developers uh dread xp oh really yeah they saw the stream they're very nice people yeah what is it what can you compare it to
[138:06.97]It's like a horror climbing game that is very like Half-Life 1 vibes.
[138:12.50]And it starts off kind of like just slow climbing, but it has a lot of good environmental story building.
[138:18.17]Okay.
[138:19.37]Yeah, it's good speed.
[138:20.51]You haven't seen anything like caught me.
[138:22.01]I've been speed running it like a lot.
[138:24.66]I feel like I've seen you play it.
[138:27.56]I need to kill like three people.
[138:32.15]Maybe we have time to mess up this poison ruin.
[138:36.82]I think just in general we don't go to ruins enough because they have the like when you go into the holes they have like three chests and we're always talking about how we don't have weapons I need to find a blacksmith is what I need because the whole reason I went to the smithing area was for them oh that's how you use it you need to find a blacksmith yeah the blacksmith guy with an anvil there's one next to that uh castle but I always forget how to get to him
[139:05.14]Are we killing the poison things or no?
[139:07.24]No, I was just looking for the staircases that go down and there's a whole bunch of chests in them.
[139:13.89]I wonder if they're in.
[139:15.53]I feel like they kind of have to be in the game, right?
[139:18.89]What?
[139:20.42]Like a way down to get an item?
[139:26.10]Yeah, I'm in one right now.
[139:27.34]Usually they have two different ones.
[139:30.09]We're safe, right?
[139:31.77]No, we're not.
[139:33.81]I got poisoned.
[139:34.37]I got poisoned.
[139:34.97]I was looking at the map.
[139:35.89]Fuck.
[139:40.34]I'm dead!
[139:40.76]Oh shit, are you alright?
[139:42.64]I got... Yeah, I got blasted.
[139:46.37]Need to res him.
[139:47.19]I can't get to him.
[139:48.75]If you lose a level, we can't get to you in time.
[139:50.93]I'm good now, yeah.
[139:52.49]We gotta move.
[139:53.27]I'm just getting out of here.
[139:54.05]I'm leaving.
[139:54.47]I'm leaving this rotten fucking area.
[139:56.80]I hate it.
[139:59.36]Yeah.
[140:02.30]Sugoi.
[140:05.96]sorry poison again you should be sorry sir I know alright we're not in a terrible and yet and yet I rarely am oh we're like right here so as it comes into the the final spot here just try and get like as many random enemy runes and kills as we can until it shows up okay
[140:28.82]we might be able to get into the castle and kill like a rune knight or Crucible Knight there's somebody right in the front door we can do it there usually is um what the heck but also you uh you share level up runes anywhere on the map with your team oh okay so it's you can really get out yeah
[141:01.78]that sounded like that hit you in real life oh man oh holy god let me I'm gonna flask near you oh oh yeah I got it yeah I got it's fine Jesus we can still touch the grace right next to the tree true get our flask back
[141:28.81]And then we're probably fighting the boss.
[141:30.50]Level six here.
[141:31.34]That's a little bit better than level three from last time.
[141:33.88]That's twice as good.
[141:35.76]Double.
[141:37.49]I feel good.
[141:38.87]Confidence rises.
[141:39.89]Alright.
[141:41.75]Lock it in.
[141:42.09]I'm trying to see what items.
[141:44.12]I just wasted a thing.
[141:45.06]Wait, I have to touch grace again to get my flasks, right?
[141:48.02]Yeah, if you just walk near it, you get one.
[141:50.77]Oh, okay.

[142:43.14]Sorry?
[142:44.27]No, how dare he?
[142:54.78]oh my god fuck oh I hate that it's nothing worse this isn't the boss is it you have to clear one wave and then the boss appears oh so it'll probably be the big demi-human and Yoda for this one they got the license yeah that's cool connect souls I must
[143:26.43]Boss incoming.
[143:30.12]Alright, I'm saving my ult.
[143:34.80]I'm gonna do my ult right now.
[143:37.73]Should've charged that up, huh?
[143:44.59]And all of my Elden skills just went right out the window in that past year.
[143:53.02]That was damage.
[144:03.27]Got him.
[144:03.73]Got him, Stark.
[144:04.93]He just woke up quick.
[144:06.30]I don't know why.
[144:09.60]It's like they're zooming around some of these motherfuckers.
[144:12.12]This motherfucker.
[144:13.31]Ooh, you motherfucker.
[144:14.77]Oh, yeah.
[144:15.27]This is one of those little guys, right?
[144:25.71]Oh, fuck.
[144:26.15]I'm gonna heal.
[144:27.13]No, don't do this.
[144:28.71]Don't do this thing.
[144:29.53]I got Vinny.
[144:39.43]Do you?
[144:42.54]I healed you.
[144:43.34]I healed you.
[144:45.64]I don't have it.
[144:46.80]You're gonna have to get him.
[144:48.95]Thank you, sir.
[144:50.57]I'm healing both of you.
[144:52.83]Oh, it only went to one.
[144:53.99]Okay, I'm learning.
[144:58.74]Yeah.
[145:05.37]Fuck away from me.
[145:07.41]Yoda's one hit wherever he is one down fire oh no sorry wrong guy that takes so much mana this little one oh this is a boss itself the little one I thought there was like two big ones nope
[145:32.78]He's a DLC guy.
[145:34.42]He didn't play it.
[145:35.72]I did, but I don't remember.
[145:38.28]I don't remember anything.
[145:41.77]Oh, damage.
[145:43.79]Alright.
[145:44.67]You did it.
[145:46.18]I didn't help that much.
[145:49.76]Flask slowly restores HP.
[145:51.91]That's kind of bad because you do not heal the same way.
[145:57.81]It's like a tick instead of like a wink.
[146:01.16]yeah it's weird these are all bad unfortunately so day two the wall's about to go down and I'm gonna immediately try and find the blacksmith here he's always in the same spot I just forget you like tag it on the map
[146:26.93]Yeah, I don't know where I'm going.
[146:29.15]That's what I'm saying.
[146:30.21]I just know he's, like, on the outside of one of the walls.
[146:34.42]We could go get another flask at the church.
[146:36.74]That's a far ways away, and I'm kind of a weirdo, and I kind of want it.
[146:42.05]I'll just follow you.
[146:43.25]I'll just follow you.
[146:44.21]Let's get it, Vinny.
[146:46.14]I don't know enough.
[146:48.66]We're just going to this church.
[146:51.83]So every church has a flask.
[146:54.23]yeah every it has a charge yep let's try to get there quick I think there's any gps in my chat can tell me where this fucking guy is what about um uh magic flasks do you get those Jerm no magic uh mana in this game is you have to like suck it out of people after you hurt them he's really good at that too
[147:26.83]And then Vinny, we could probably clear this thing too.
[147:30.24]Yeah, I'm down for that.
[147:32.16]Alright, let me make sure we can get over there.
[147:34.76]From there.
[147:35.28]Yeah, we can.
[147:47.70]Woohoo!
[147:48.04]Yeah!
[147:49.56]Yeah!
[147:49.68]Wah!
[147:49.78]Yeah!
[147:49.90]Wah!
[147:50.44]Bing!
[147:52.54]Bing!
[147:52.86]Bing!
[147:54.24]Bing!
[147:54.91]That's the Mario noise.
[147:55.98]That's the famous one.
[147:58.72]That is the famous one.
[148:00.62]He's pretty well known for that, I think.
[148:03.44]Let's get the church first.
[148:06.85]Just so we can be on the way back towards the circle.
[148:17.94]I'm just now realizing that clicking in the left stick to sprint uses more, like, stamina.
[148:24.68]Does it?
[148:26.04]Yeah, it actually only if you're in combat, yeah.
[148:31.15]OK, just.
[148:35.10]To this guy chill.
[148:37.60]Alright, let's.
[148:40.97]Let's alright, let's clear that other area right here.
[148:46.90]We got our flask coming towards you guys.
[148:51.09]Did you find the blacksmith yet, Star?
[148:53.09]Yeah, I got him a while ago.
[148:55.56]Oh, because I have a Smithing Stone as well.
[148:57.66]I need to do that too.
[148:58.98]I will mark.
[149:00.59]There's multiple on the map, but that's like the only one I can ever remember vaguely where they are.
[149:13.42]Why is he not locked down?
[149:17.45]Okay.
[149:21.57]Okay, I need to... Alright.
[149:28.19]There might be a boss over here.
[149:32.90]Some items here.
[149:33.30]Shit, I need mana.
[149:35.54]Uh, we got a golem here.
[149:36.62]They're usually not that bad.
[149:38.49]But, uh, let's go.
[149:39.39]Are you ready?
[149:40.99]I'm almost ready.
[149:42.17]Sorry, I'm fighting a guy.
[149:43.71]Alright, I'm good now.
[149:44.75]Should be good.
[149:45.23]I'm ready.
[149:45.81]We should have time to kill it.
[149:47.07]It's just one of these shitty little slow golems.
[150:07.43]we're killing a golem over here Ster if you want whatever we get yeah I'm birding to you I think we also need to bird more I wish that didn't take so long man the camera loved that I wish if you didn't have mana you didn't sit there and scratch your head for 10 seconds well then maybe you shouldn't do it
[150:36.22]You mistake maker.
[150:38.04]Trying to replace a sword, but this is good.
[150:40.05]Improved damage negation at full HP and golden slam.
[150:44.39]So, like, replacing one of your default weapons, that's okay, right?
[150:49.96]Generally?
[150:50.54]Yes.
[150:51.42]Yeah, because there's no stealth on it.
[150:52.70]Alright, we got to move.
[150:55.89]Oh, golden stomp is good.
[150:59.47]Also deals more damage, I see.
[151:01.38]Let's get in that circle.
[151:04.75]Do I have time for the church?
[151:06.49]I think I do.
[151:07.59]I think you do have time.
[151:08.52]There's nothing really in the way.
[151:10.74]Holy weapon is amazing for Gladius.
[151:29.53]We need to stab.
[151:30.27]Oh!
[151:31.17]We're doing the, uh, virgin.
[151:34.66]Whoa.
[151:36.38]Improved skill attack power.
[151:40.92]Alright, Vinny, there's a virgin in here.
[151:43.83]Excuse me?
[151:45.71]Is this Monty Python in the Holy Grail?
[151:50.89]I'm dyin'!
[151:52.37]Come, come, come, come.
[151:54.14]What the da-da-da-da-da-da-da?
[151:58.28]Gimme a whack.
[152:00.43]Thank you.
[152:14.28]Hmm.
[152:14.38]That's the best way to approach this.
[152:17.63]Kill.
[152:18.47]Oh, I remember this.
[152:19.53]It's a different land in the base game.
[152:25.06]Like really surprise.
[152:26.98]Oh, HP restored upon attack.
[152:28.96]Yeah, different land.
[152:31.39]The land is between... Yeah, dude.
[152:34.05]It would be to, like, fantasy land.
[152:35.88]Okay, we're good.
[152:37.86]There's a chest in here.
[152:38.60]I don't know if we want to get it, but I'm going to try.
[152:41.02]Oh, three of three.
[152:42.95]Dude.
[152:43.37]Alright, let's take a look.
[152:47.90]Taking damage boosts negation.
[152:51.98]Pickled turtleneck.
[152:53.34]That's my favorite.
[152:54.33]We Italians love that.
[152:59.85]alright let's keep moving alright following you uh is there a big thing in there there is there is it is available okay where do you want to go next yeah just come by and I like pick up the fucking scraps
[153:26.51]uh I don't we did that fire we have to go to the right I think the big castle is there no blacksmith like nearby that that we could easily that would be incredible yeah if there's an easy blacksmith he is there on the other side of the castle I'm going to do it alright well the circle is closing in it'll be fine sorry my voice is all up pot thrower
[153:58.71]Are there, like, on the side of the castle?
[154:01.81]Where the mark is.
[154:05.12]Oh, I see it, okay.
[154:06.21]Yeah, don't follow me.
[154:07.29]I don't need to go to it.
[154:08.75]I made a mistake, though, clearly.
[154:12.76]um where is he I think he's there is he inside or no outside he's um on the other side you can see the campfire you got to jump down and go up the thing down and up the thing yeah you see where the campfire is a little fire on the other side of the oh like over here you mean yep there is
[154:39.81]smithing stones are way different in this vinny so you can only like do a one Smithing Stone and a second one okay and if your weapon's already like purple you can't that's like as far as it goes holy shit this thing is disgusting now wait dude is this I have a stone sword key I want to do this I'm coming back okay um
[155:04.37]I don't see the blacksmith.
[155:05.81]Oh, oh, here it is.
[155:06.49]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[155:07.49]Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[155:09.25]Yeah, you can also buy an extra item slot from him.
[155:13.86]I should have done that.
[155:14.50]Fuck off.
[155:14.76]And he also sells the regular Smithing Stone if you don't have one.
[155:17.29]Oh, you just talk to the dude.
[155:18.71]Just talk to the dude.
[155:19.17]I see them.
[155:19.71]I see this stuff.
[155:20.41]Okay.
[155:20.53]And then you upgrade on the anvil.
[155:21.85]I bought that.
[155:26.04]Anything else I should buy here, or...?
[155:28.44]Nah.
[155:32.05]Redstone blade.
[155:34.24]I'm on my way.
[155:34.88]Alright.
[155:37.12]Cool swords.
[155:37.82]Yeah, maybe there's some cool swords, but I'm going to stick with this one since I upgraded it.
[155:42.29]Alright.
[155:45.79]Yeah, on the map, Vinny, those blue swirly with the crater in the bottom.
[155:50.30]It's like the blue fire looking things.
[155:51.56]That's the things you can jump super high on.
[155:55.19]Oh.
[155:55.95]So if you're ever lost and you're like, what the fuck?
[155:57.69]Where do I go?
[155:58.01]Where do I go?
[156:00.18]Okay.
[156:00.58]Get to one of those and launch.
[156:08.74]This guy is kicking my ass.
[156:10.37]I'm coming.
[156:16.18]I'm going to go to one of those.
[156:17.92]This guy is killing all of my dudes.
[156:21.26]Kill his ass.
[156:23.55]Oh, come on.
[156:24.25]He's walking faster than I can shoot.
[156:26.15]What is this thing?
[156:26.91]What is this thing?
[156:27.78]Oh, no.
[156:28.40]Oh, golden hippopotamus.
[156:29.40]Golden hippopotamus.
[156:30.20]No, no, no, no, no.
[156:31.32]yeah you just want to jump past him I've done that unless you're a big hippo fan not really king hippo from punch out about it
[156:56.77]You got me.
[156:57.63]I got you.
[156:58.97]Oh, that's not reaching you?
[157:00.51]They're hitting the ground next to me.
[157:19.76]Nice.
[157:22.82]Okay.
[157:22.94]Do you have the Scarlet Roth thing?
[157:25.10]yeah damn are you scarlet rotting others not you guys I'm just I'm doing the Malenia yeah blade of mickle I am Malenia blade of mickle oh we can do golden hippo no it's coming in let's not who are they gonna cast as let me solo her in the movie I wonder Jack black just steal a chat member from the thing from earlier let me solo her iron lung part-time
[157:54.64]whatever he says he did if he gets out of the situation what the fuck are you talking about this is so out of pocket what what does that even mean that was the most fucking absurd thing I've ever heard
[158:12.79]There's a Deathbird here.
[158:13.73]We've never fought one of these.
[158:14.72]You guys, uh... I think the run... Just moves past immediately.
[158:18.16]Doesn't even elaborate.
[158:19.32]The run's going a little too well for us to die to the fucking Deathbird.
[158:22.71]Oh, I didn't realize we were, like, final circle.
[158:25.25]We're in the final circle.
[158:26.83]Wait, Deathbird's bad?
[158:30.48]You know what?
[158:30.88]I'm just gonna assume something called Deathbird is bad.
[158:33.16]It's very bad.
[158:33.64]Yeah, it's death.
[158:37.17]It's still a little low level for...
[158:40.59]Where we're at.
[158:45.95]If we can get to 10 to 11, we should be fine.
[158:52.79]I think level 11 is good.
[158:56.09]I'm currently 10.
[158:56.87]Oh, are we fighting this thing or no?
[158:59.10]I guess we're doing it.
[159:00.78]Let's see how much damage we do to it.
[159:11.40]Theoretically.
[159:12.10]I like the cartoon bubble noises.
[159:21.54]Those are fun.
[159:26.79]Circle's too close.
[159:27.95]We're not getting it.
[159:28.79]That's gotta go.
[159:30.77]I think it just jumps around too much.
[159:33.90]I got to hit it like one time.
[159:40.59]There's a hero of Zamor here now?
[159:43.62]Oh, we got to get the fuck out.
[159:44.56]We're going to aggro three bosses.
[159:46.42]Oh, this is not good.
[159:47.98]This is not good.
[159:48.81]This is a disaster in the making.
[159:51.37]Honestly, I don't think they can get pulled into the circle, but if they did, that would actually be very helpful.
[159:57.28]Please use your character abilities.
[159:58.92]You're right, chat member.
[160:00.26]You are right.
[160:05.85]Excuse me?
[160:06.45]Who just did that?
[160:11.39]Oh, they're already here.
[160:20.43]Yeah, that is a, like, one-hit scarlet rot on these.
[160:27.30]Is this the hero?
[160:28.14]I just powerbombed him!
[160:31.73]I can't do damage to this thing.
[160:33.03]This thing is not taking damage.
[160:35.66]They're pretty tanky.
[160:37.02]This is this is pretty normal for like.
[160:40.46]This part three player, yeah.
[160:46.61]Alright alright alright.
[160:48.79]What level are you?
[160:50.87]Like 11.
[160:52.63]What the fuck?
[160:56.87]No 9 I'm 9 level 9.
[161:00.04]Hard time.
[161:04.38]That is so strong.
[161:07.69]I don't have enough mana to do it to the boss now though.
[161:17.74]What?
[161:18.06]What are you looking at me for?
[161:27.97]That's good.
[161:28.93]That's good.
[161:29.75]We're doing good.
[161:30.39]Now we got to fight the real boss.
[161:32.73]Where's the level up?
[161:33.95]We have a level up?
[161:34.66]No.
[161:35.40]Not until after him.
[161:39.75]This guy's easy.
[161:40.45]He's the tutorial boss.
[161:42.07]Yeah.
[161:42.93]Yeah, I definitely didn't die to this guy.
[161:46.02]Big damage incoming.
[161:51.41]You have Starlight Shards item?
[161:55.78]Me?
[161:56.02]Anybody?
[161:56.62]Anybody.
[161:57.22]I don't think so.
[162:00.44]What is this shit cloud?
[162:03.44]This guy wants me to put my foolish ambitions to rest.
[162:19.02]Running away, running away.
[162:20.78]Oh, God.
[162:30.27]Yeah, that thing's strong.
[162:32.48]Wait, that's not one of ours.
[162:34.18]Oh.
[162:35.07]No, when he phase transitions, he does weird, like, destroy the whole screen with red.
[162:48.92]Why don't I have magic anymore?
[162:51.57]Mana?
[162:52.67]Mana, yeah.
[162:54.13]Oh, how did you get me with that?
[162:55.43]That's not even fair.
[162:56.45]Patch the game.
[162:57.31]It needs to be patched.
[163:03.23]Your blue bar is gone.
[163:04.71]You used it on your special, but how do I get it back?
[163:07.25]Oh, I'm dead again.
[163:07.91]I'm sorry.
[163:08.60]Fuck.
[163:09.00]I got him.
[163:11.76]You have to get me up.
[163:13.90]Get Ster first.
[163:14.82]Get Ster first.
[163:16.22]Do not die.
[163:16.72]Do not die.
[163:18.01]Okay, I won't.
[163:27.92]Don't worry, Vinny.
[163:30.66]I'm worried.

[164:10.28]Melfur.
[164:13.22]It makes you... Iron Jar makes you tanky.
[164:15.75]Oh, oops.
[164:20.91]I wish I did not use my mana.
[164:22.48]He was hard for me to get near.
[164:24.78]And I'm trying to stay up because my ult res'es everybody in case of emergency.
[164:29.70]I got damage coming.
[164:36.73]Oh, I need to stay alive, though.
[164:45.16]Die, you fucker!

[165:07.44]Just kill him.
[165:10.49]Oh shit.
[165:11.13]Okay.

[166:15.12]Just yakking.
[166:16.43]That's awful.
[166:16.87]And it was like, oh, God, I got off the train, went to another train car, and then the yakker followed me and all the rest of us into the train car because they wanted to avoid their own yak.
[166:27.28]It was so bad.
[166:30.33]But you needed to know that.

[167:29.87]Wow, that looks cool.
[167:31.35]Yeah, it's really pretty in here.
[167:32.66]I am holy.
[167:35.86]Uh...
[167:39.39]dude imagine imagine if you opened your fridge Vinny and in the back of the fridge was this two to three month old rotten chicken in the back and just like oh you have to take it out it's covered in green mold and stuff that's like kind of what this is like oh what the hell gross yeah
[168:01.75]I've had that happen a couple times.
[168:03.75]Did you ever, like, keep something, like, leftovers in your fridge, then you come back to it, like, a day or two later, and your whole fridge just smells bad for, like, a week?
[168:11.28]Vinny, you like that joke?
[168:13.10]Yeah, did he steal it?
[168:16.40]I mean... I was... Who was it?
[168:18.87]Was it yours?
[168:20.15]Yeah.
[168:21.23]I guess mine.
[168:22.83]I was part of the writer's room.
[168:26.79]Alright, fucking Mencia.
[168:29.92]You know...
[168:32.48]I had, like, Modelo beer in my fridge that were, like, expired, and I drank them when I was playing Final Fantasy XVI, and my chat was like... It made me better.
[168:41.00]Like, mold powers.
[168:43.37]So, drink moldy beer is the lesson learned.
[168:52.33]Yeah, you really want to watch out for this thing, because the gigantic God of War chain sweep is the one fuck.
[169:03.19]And then also the other attack.
[169:06.05]I've wasted all of my magic on not hitting it.
[169:22.74]Alright.
[169:22.96]Damn it.
[169:23.44]It's too fast.
[169:24.24]It's too fast.
[169:24.86]I can't use my magic.
[169:25.95]It's fucked.
[169:30.41]Yeah, I needed to stand still for one second.
[169:37.20]Did that nothing hit?
[169:38.49]That's crazy.
[169:41.23]Don't even know if that hit.
[169:45.24]Scarlet rotted him.
[170:08.82]Alright, here comes a split.
[170:11.76]Back up, back up.
[170:14.14]Leaving.
[170:15.38]Oh, man.

[170:20.07]Oh, God, there's three of them.
[170:21.61]They're all the same.
[170:23.89]What?

[171:41.95]I'm gonna play real safe because of my ult.
[171:48.26]What the fuck?
[171:48.76]I didn't... No!
[171:50.76]Oh my god.
[171:51.44]That's so annoying.
[171:52.83]I can't believe I fucked that up.
[171:55.31]I was trying to drink the other potion.
[171:56.47]I thought you hit it for square.
[171:57.42]Split.
[172:09.24]Hmm.
[172:17.68]Oh.
[172:32.91]is it even worth trying to attack these guys when they're separated or I I think you have to a certain amount okay before he uh reforms I fell down I threw so hard that's so annoying I equipped the potion and I was like trying to drink it with square but you have to drink it with up okay it reformed I think we're good though
[173:00.86]I don't have magic to do the thing.
[173:06.62]Just use the inability for no reason there.
[173:13.27]Alright, big damage coming up.
[173:20.08]Miss.
[173:21.68]Oh fuck, I'm down.
[173:24.49]Shit.
[173:24.77]Couldn't dodge that one.
[173:25.85]And boy did I try.
[173:29.73]Wow, Star, you did it.
[173:31.25]That's clutch as fuck.
[173:36.90]That's annoying.
[173:41.71]Try and get him to go for my guy.
[173:43.57]Yeah, they all did.
[173:44.87]And I'm gonna be Malenia.
[173:48.52]Got him.
[173:49.44]Got him, got him, got him, got him, got him, got him, got him, got him, got him.
[173:52.65]We're good.
[173:54.79]I said that was very slow.
[174:01.33]Oh, oh.
[174:03.89]Just kill.
[174:04.58]Just kill.
[174:05.50]Just kill.
[174:06.00]I knocked me down.
[174:07.16]They knocked me down.
[174:08.61]Oh, Jerma Jerma.
[174:10.69]No, fuck.
[174:12.29]This character has like no stamina.
[174:15.93]That's so sad.
[174:16.64]No, that was all my fault.
[174:18.06]You have no idea.
[174:18.82]Alright, so I got one of those.
[174:21.10]Dude, I drank one flask that whole fight.
[174:23.93]I chugged three in a row because I was trying to press square to drink the fucking other flask, but it's up on the D-pad.
[174:30.38]And I was like, why am I not drinking it?
[174:33.01]Oh my God.
[174:34.03]I was told I didn't use my ult, but I did.
[174:37.10]I tried to and it didn't do anything.
[174:38.94]I was out of magic or mana.
[174:41.43]That was my fault.
[174:42.53]I'll take that one.
[174:43.89]Does it work anyway?
[174:45.58]What?
[174:46.26]You were wilder?
[174:46.84]Wilder, yeah.
[174:48.40]The punch?
[174:49.44]Yeah, does it work anyway?
[174:50.40]It doesn't cost FP?
[174:51.52]It doesn't cost mana, no.
[174:52.70]Dude, I tried using it and nothing happened.
[174:54.83]Also, you're immune to damage in the whole animation.
[174:57.59]You can hold the button down.
[174:59.17]God.
[175:00.71]I think everybody's immune to damage.
[175:03.25]Is the 10 straight years of FromSoftware press square to use item that you have to unlearn?
[175:13.26]Sometimes it just rears its ugly head.
[175:18.29]man it's always been that way I know what you mean though because you have to usually switch to your Estus yeah it's just the Estus is on square only and then I in my brain in the middle of the fight it's like oh okay I'm gonna switch to this and use this flask
[175:34.99]That was a good fight, though.
[175:36.65]We had that.
[175:38.96]We really did.
[175:40.14]And it was my ult, too.
[175:42.24]My chat's saying... I tried to use it.
[175:44.58]I think I was 98%.
[175:45.86]And I was like, oh, it doesn't work.
[175:47.84]I have no mana.
[175:49.22]And I just accepted that reality.
[175:54.49]We almost had it.
[175:55.53]I'm going to try Executor.
[175:59.41]He's very hard.
[176:01.13]I mean, he's good because he gets all the bleed katanas, but his ability...
[176:05.03]I think is... Bait.
[176:09.56]Really?
[176:10.38]Hey, for your second game, Vinny, that was actually great.
[176:12.92]Like, you... Thanks.
[176:14.16]That's... Very difficult fight.
[176:19.83]Um... I'm gonna pee real quick.
[176:22.28]Yeah, I'm gonna go pee too.
[176:23.90]Alright.
[176:24.20]Oh!
[176:24.64]Pissing alone?
[176:26.52]No, we're not.
[176:28.83]Okay.
[176:29.03]We clearly are not.
[176:31.01]Alright, have fun.
[176:32.05]Don't judge.
[176:32.89]BRB.
[181:27.97]That was a cool Alolan form.
[181:29.73]That's fun.
[181:33.32]Alolo?
[181:34.86]Hello.
[181:35.46]Do you ever play, yeah, do you ever play Pokémon Hawaii?
[181:42.83]Pokémon Hawaii?
[181:45.09]Yeah.
[181:48.82]Sun and moon.
[181:51.40]Same thing.
[181:52.44]I've played almost no Pokémon.
[181:55.09]I don't like the words you're saying.
[181:57.82]they're in the bible oh okay it strictly is in the genesis chapter about Pokémon Pikachu and all that stuff he's in there that's fine then I didn't know that maybe I'll try doing incantations
[182:31.55]Do you have revenant?
[182:34.12]Uh, I don't, but can't the... Um... Oh, I think we lost... Oh, wait.
[182:41.31]What?
[182:43.99]Uh... What?
[182:45.69]Can we cancel?
[182:46.77]I don't think we can.
[182:49.52]Were we not ready yet?
[182:50.96]What happened?
[182:52.26]You... I think you lost... I think it booted you from the party.
[182:54.54]That was weird.
[182:57.31]Oh, shit.
[183:02.67]I'm here.
[183:03.37]I mean, I guess we just didn't want to start.
[183:07.04]No, you are.
[183:08.14]That's weird.
[183:09.28]That was really weird.
[183:10.90]Oh, shit.
[183:11.56]Okay, I would have done the other guy.
[183:13.79]It might cancel then.
[183:15.83]Yeah, okay, it skipped.
[183:18.19]Oh, there we go.
[183:24.84]Yeah, I'm still irrationally angry at that fucking potion blunder.
[183:29.37]I blundered my ult.
[183:30.75]You're good.
[183:31.01]That was such an angry piss.
[183:31.87]It's my fault.
[183:34.90]I did everything perfect.
[183:36.98]And I rezzed you all.
[183:39.41]I can't believe I drank three flasks in a row.
[183:42.15]Just like one, two, three.
[183:48.12]I have to rejoin their lobby.
[183:49.52]A lot of my flasks I use to heal you guys.
[183:53.45]My little baby boo-boos.

[185:40.01]Yeah, you open a little box.
[185:43.99]Okay.
[185:44.33]Alright.

[185:52.67]You got to just pay.
[185:54.09]That can never happen.

[193:40.75]What the fuck, dude?
[193:43.77]Oh, man.
[193:46.51]This ain't looking good.
[193:52.32]Maybe you're a wizard.
[193:54.84]I blamed the bird in the beginning.
[193:56.36]Me and Vinny hit the wall, and you just kept going, and we were so far behind at that point.
[194:01.57]it is my fault no no it's not your fault I'm saying we didn't make that no that's not what it is it's not your fault no we didn't do it I pressed the button to descend I was I was hold I was holding up to try to like go up but holding up makes you go down you don't need to touch anything it follows a track okay well it put me like really far away
[194:27.10]Why did it put you that far away?
[194:29.44]I don't know.
[194:30.57]Because you probably immediately disembarked it and it went down.
[194:35.49]And then you get some control of it.
[194:39.14]Are you here to help me fight the Crucible Knight?
[194:41.58]I would love to at level two.
[194:43.46]It's going to be tricky, but I mean.
[194:45.84]This is how you level up.
[194:47.48]It is.
[194:47.80]I'm going to jump across.
[194:51.57]It's cool.
[194:51.97]I'm level one.
[194:52.61]I'll be there in a minute.
[194:53.77]You guys will be fine when I'm there.
[194:58.12]I mean he's gonna fucking kill me.
[195:00.24]I'm here.
[195:00.84]Without some distraction.
[195:06.01]That was not... okay.
[195:11.77]I'll get you.
[195:26.66]I feel like he just has a kick.
[195:38.32]oh my god he hit all three of us with that I didn't take any damage for that weirdly alright here's the comeback we leveling we'll get like three levels here I mean in an ideal world we just kill crucible knights for a bit at these levels until the circle comes in level three
[196:05.84]Oh, there's a church right here.
[196:07.00]Let's get the church.
[196:07.88]Yeah.
[196:09.50]I don't know what my ult does as this guy.
[196:12.17]You fly.
[196:12.81]Oh, it turns you into the big dog.
[196:14.11]Yeah, you turn into a huge animal.
[196:16.97]Alright.
[196:17.63]You look like a boss and we all get scared for a second and go, oh, I thought that was the boss.
[196:21.36]Was Poke playing this character yesterday?
[196:24.42]Yeah.
[196:24.74]Yeah.
[196:25.54]Yeah.
[196:30.77]Pick it up.
[196:33.59]I get it.
[196:35.13]I got it.
[196:39.25]one more level and I think we can do it what can we kill alright crucible night time are there more there's a ton in the castle yeah I just don't know how long we have we might like if the circle starts coming in once we start fighting when it's going to be real sad
[197:09.91]Oh boy, there are many.
[197:10.90]There are two.
[197:13.24]Two is, yeah.
[197:14.33]Try not to aggro top one, he's stronger.
[197:16.01]One at a time.
[197:33.07]Oh, he stomped me.
[197:49.18]I'm healing you.
[197:50.07]Thank you.
[197:51.35]Oh man.
[197:52.39]Oh, you weren't up yet.
[197:53.13]I don't think I counted.
[197:53.89]Do we have enough time to kill this one too?
[197:55.81]No, circle just started.
[197:56.75]Oh shit, hear it.
[198:00.52]That should be one more level though for all of us, right?
[198:03.74]think so maybe I don't I think I need like 30 000 I don't know I don't know this item here yep I could do one more rank four plot alright I'm level four what are you guys five
[198:28.90]five chain attack finishers that would be you Vinny I think um sure yeah I'll take it this area is kind of horrible I haven't done it at all but these enemies do suck flame chariots if we can kill like one that would be nice you can backstab
[198:56.83]They explode.
[198:57.57]These guys explode.
[198:58.35]Be careful.
[199:05.40]I remember them.
[199:08.17]What is for frosting me?
[199:11.79]OK, as long as it's not them.
[199:14.37]Oh, you can jump on their heads.
[199:18.24]I remember that.
[199:18.84]I don't think it's going to happen here, but.
[199:22.82]That was a thing you could do to get the stab.
[199:27.62]These guys are all going to blow up.
[199:28.81]It's going to be terrifying.
[199:48.64]That took a really long time for one.
[199:51.64]I know.
[199:52.02]These guys suck.
[199:53.85]Okay.
[199:54.95]Oh, because that's not one.
[199:57.17]That's multiple flame chariot.
[199:58.86]We got to go.
[200:00.88]Godskin Peeler was a big one for me when I played the main game.
[200:04.89]Oh, did you take that?
[200:05.93]That's cool.
[200:07.45]Oh, do you want it?
[200:08.51]No.
[200:10.35]I'm not going to use it.
[200:12.42]Maybe, but don't worry about it right now.
[200:20.50]well it's as good as it's gonna get we pulled it back from a disaster though so I think we're doing alright yeah I just would like a decent weapon I really want to go into the sewer that boss gives such good items we I think we just need to be able to do it so we could get a little bit stronger and do it
[200:43.85]We do need better items, that is for sure.
[200:47.14]You get so much for beating it.
[200:50.96]And then we can do the other crucible.
[201:07.62]Good.
[201:07.76]Ster, if you've got like a multi-heal, now would be a good time.
[201:13.86]Thank you.
[201:22.70]I need to hop into my menu for a second.
[201:24.93]Um... Oh, the, the Shamshir is good.
[201:28.13]White Shadow's Lore?
[201:31.67]Uh, that attracts enemies.
[201:33.85]Oh, that sounds not... Oh my god.
[201:35.76]Why?
[201:37.08]Oh, boy.
[201:39.24]Oof.
[201:42.06]Firing a super shot.
[201:47.52]Oh, let him have it.
[201:58.33]Oh god!
[202:01.88]I got this.
[202:04.20]Done 3% enemy damage.
[202:08.52]As a giant fuckbeast.
[202:10.38]You're dying?
[202:10.86]I was lying about being invulnerable?
[202:13.93]I was lying?
[202:14.81]Oh.
[202:15.99]Oh, what just hit me in the back?
[202:18.32]Is that his sword?
[202:19.12]Alright, thank you.
[202:36.07]Dude, he just hit me with a backswing.
[202:58.79]oh yeah this is not a great situation uh I've got warming stone oh that can kill that was a multi-hit attack that was not a one-hit attack I parried the first one yeah I thought it was way faster than that oh I didn't get that
[203:31.49]Try to distract a little bit.
[203:34.59]Thank you.
[203:39.52]Yippee.
[203:42.10]Now this is pod racing.
[203:52.92]Nice, dude.
[203:56.36]Excellent.
[204:01.44]wow he just let me do that sometimes that enemy like at certain ranges really just wants to go get one guy and rp walks it I guess I'm gonna take longer walk improve dodging
[204:35.56]uh there's a church right here and then we go back I don't know I have really two levels I I think it's really funny how my first run was the walk build was like the most extreme version of this game yeah so does it just happen automatically
[204:57.11]yeah if you're like slow walking it'll cast it whenever it's off cooldown okay because I walk pretty slow with the bow alright uh church uh when you're drinking a flask it that's like it counts as walking as well I want a different bow this thing's kind of uh let's do this shitty area how do you feel about that I think I want to get I love shitty areas
[205:25.19]so when you say when you say walk builds when you walk it just shoots magic yeah there's a couple upgrades that are like while walking do x weird I had like two or three of them it crashed my game on the first playthrough alright I don't think we're gonna be strong enough for sewer world let's do whatever this is
[205:55.16]is that the church where's the church oh here here okay and then to my pin this might be a dragon let's get it it is an urge tree avatar these things have a shit ton of ac and co-op
[206:24.76]okay that's that's good that's good you walked on him I walked on him oh come on dude why are you doing that on me what happens when your your dog runs out of okay never mind
[207:02.16]Where's the, where's the spy?
[207:03.66]You got it, sir?
[207:04.76]Yeah.
[207:05.26]You can keep damaging him in this, also.
[207:11.13]There's a fucking bat on me.
[207:14.33]Ooh.
[207:16.34]Use L2 as dog?
[207:18.48]Oh, I didn't think to do that.
[207:26.83]Get the fuck away from me, bat!
[207:32.09]Dog also has a LB roar.
[207:34.08]I don't know what it does.
[207:36.58]Might debuff or something.
[207:38.70]I don't know.
[207:56.53]Slam.
[207:58.11]Oh, you can't parry.
[207:58.95]Oh, yes, you can.
[208:00.13]Yeah, you can parry everything.
[208:03.45]You got to run.
[208:05.03]Okay.
[208:06.15]Okay.
[208:06.41]I tried to parry that and that was death.
[208:08.75]So never mind.
[208:12.12]I think you still need stamina to parry some of the big hits.
[208:15.86]I think something.
[208:17.18]He's not happy with me.
[208:21.84]Thank you.
[208:22.45]I won't die again.
[208:23.21]I'm going to get you up.
[208:27.33]I won't forget you, buddy.
[208:29.41]I won't forget you, buddy.
[208:30.91]He's doing the sprinkles.
[208:32.54]We got to run.
[208:39.53]sprinkles part two oh it is sprinkles sprinkles sorry I'm good I'm happy I'm lucky that's too many sprinkles like in life I'm not really going to be able to get you with three ticks don't worry about it don't worry about just kill him you're gonna lose all your souls if we don't get you though it's whatever he's almost dead just don't let his timer run out
[209:13.01]He's going to die here in a sec.
[209:16.79]Fuck.
[209:18.65]Sorry, you can get your souls.
[209:22.00]Or he's going to lose a level, rather.
[209:23.18]Did I get the souls from him?
[209:27.57]Yeah, you should have.
[209:28.99]You have 33,000.
[209:31.73]Finally.
[209:33.95]Yeah, he dropped some good shit.
[209:35.09]I think circle might be coming in.
[209:37.48]Yeah, I didn't really level very much, but oh well.
[209:40.82]Finally, a cool bow.
[209:45.79]Black Knife.
[209:47.86]Cold Petal Whip.
[209:51.06]Improved critical hits.
[209:59.59]Circle's coming, but we're in it.
[210:02.66]Uh, what's priority to get?
[210:03.80]We gotta try to get to level 10.
[210:07.50]Castle?
[210:09.33]Crucibles?
[210:09.73]Did he pick up souls?
[210:12.23]Oh yeah, my lost runes, yeah.
[210:20.08]I think if we spend all of our time killing the castle sewer boss, it will be worth it.
[210:24.71]I agree.
[210:25.93]How do you dual wield?
[210:28.51]You have to equip it in the left hand.
[210:32.92]So it is the bottom row.
[210:39.80]Got it, thank you.
[210:41.24]This thing's kind of great.
[210:46.03]Blackknife is one of the best weapons in the game.
[210:58.04]Need two weapons of the same class.
[211:02.74]Wait, what is that?
[211:05.37]Two properly power stand.
[211:06.99]Oh, I need another knife.
[211:08.07]Got it.
[211:08.93]Alright.
[211:09.75]Yeah.
[211:14.44]The knife!
[211:16.04]The knife!
[211:17.52]I have my ult to res as well.
[211:21.67]It seems like a way shorter cooldown than the summoner girl.
[211:24.17]It's really good.
[211:27.18]uh let's wait for vinny so we don't aggro and get killed okay I'm gonna check the loot guy up here then I'm almost there there's a blacksmith here too if needed I mean that's not I mean I'm just gonna take it I need the shield okay
[211:52.00]You guys are at the castle, right?
[211:53.54]Yep, we're down at the castle.
[211:54.16]At the castle and you drop down and there's a sewer entrance.
[211:57.09]Okay, got it.
[211:58.81]I'm here.
[212:02.69]Almost here.
[212:03.81]God.
[212:07.08]Okay, this is not a bad fight.
[212:11.90]Nice.
[212:25.15]Holy shit.
[212:26.67]This bow is pretty good.
[212:29.01]I think we're good.
[212:29.81]I think we can pull this out of our ass if we really do well.
[212:34.46]This weapon is going fucking crazy too.
[212:37.28]That's huge.
[212:38.98]This is massive.
[212:40.06]Legendary.
[212:42.71]Great enemy felled.
[212:44.33]Wing of Astel.
[212:46.73]I got the Ruins Greatsword.
[212:48.79]It's a two-handed fucking massive sword.
[212:50.95]One of you should take it.
[212:53.12]Vinny, you should probably take it.
[212:55.54]I'm not going to use it.
[212:56.44]I don't think you don't think you use it.
[212:57.58]Let me see it.
[212:58.20]Drop it.
[212:58.52]Let me see it.
[212:59.14]I mean, I right here quick.
[213:01.86]OK, OK, OK.
[213:05.15]It's on the ground.
[213:08.99]I have many Dodge.
[213:12.10]Yeah, I'm not going to use that.
[213:13.38]This weapon is really good.
[213:14.46]OK, I would come upstairs and we get it.
[213:16.54]There's another chest up here that always gives a talisman.
[213:18.72]Oh, and there's a crucible night.
[213:23.05]Just pick it up for the passive.
[213:25.47]I got the passive yeah alright where are we going up here where I am I'm getting my ass kicked so is he oh man that knife big I have such a good weapon with this knife it's unreal
[213:55.81]oh god this is what having items is like yeah run saved and then this also always has a talisman of choice ooh raises immunity raises magic attack but lowers damage negation improve thrust encounter attack 20 Ster um what are you using that anymore immunity or take the fp whatever
[214:24.27]Give arrow reach talisman to Jerma.
[214:27.99]I can drop it.
[214:29.35]Jerma, can you pick that up?
[214:30.83]Where'd it go?
[214:32.14]It's right here.
[214:34.20]No, never mind.
[214:35.22]Hang on.
[214:35.52]Let me do this for you.
[214:37.12]Let me pick it up.
[214:37.72]That's my old one.
[214:39.23]Oh, there's the roar?
[214:40.07]Hang on.
[214:41.05]I got something for you.
[214:41.79]Hang on.
[214:44.23]There you go.
[214:44.77]That's yours.
[214:46.30]Ooh, that's awesome.
[214:47.74]That's massive.
[214:48.52]Thank you.
[214:49.64]Alright.
[214:49.90]We got a knight here.
[214:53.26]very good nice work that's silly oh he I didn't know he dropped one of these
[215:21.83]Meteoric or blade sorceries and incantations.
[215:26.73]Does my enchanted shot count as a sorcery or an incantation?
[215:31.08]No shit.
[215:37.75]Yeah, but you would like that if it did.
[215:41.05]Alright, uh, we are.
[215:44.06]We need a grace.
[215:47.04]Don't worry about the grace until we'll get one on the way in.
[215:51.32]Alright, well, we should probably move.
[215:54.03]Let's get something going here.
[215:57.99]We are all... Oh, we got to go down.
[216:01.66]We're good.
[216:03.04]Where are we going, Jerm?
[216:04.20]Where are you, Ster?
[216:05.28]Are you down?
[216:06.85]There was looting chests that were here.
[216:09.67]I'm going to drop down.
[216:11.05]Let's go down.
[216:11.61]Jerm would be good for the katana.
[216:13.82]less likely to be targeted.
[216:15.06]Do you want this, Jerma, for the passive?
[216:17.10]I would love it.
[216:18.84]Let's get to the designated zone first.
[216:21.05]Yeah, that sounds great.
[216:22.31]Does this lock on sometimes, really?
[216:32.84]Like, will not change targets?
[216:34.58]Yeah, I thought I was going crazy, but it really does feel like a third of the time, when you try to switch, it doesn't work.
[216:41.81]use the bat Black Knife ability then power stance katanas well I'm gonna give this to Jerm I think this is better for him oh Smithing Stone Godskin stitcher alright I'm level 10 I think we're alright we'll be level 11 probably for the boss we're very close to 11.
[217:20.34]Scary people coming up.
[217:22.86]Alright, Jerma, I'm going to drop this katana for you because less enemy targeting.
[217:28.15]Nice.
[217:28.69]Perfect.
[217:29.39]Thank you.
[217:33.78]Mm-hmm.
[217:33.94]Okay.
[217:34.72]Alright, well.
[217:39.45]Very cool.
[217:40.97]Yep.
[217:42.96]I need FP.
[217:45.45]Oh, also, I should level up.
[217:46.95]Defeating enemies restores FP.
[217:48.81]You want it?
[217:49.80]It's a talisman.
[217:52.76]Maybe.
[217:53.52]Let me hit the level up and then that'll be good.
[217:58.69]I'm level 10 now.
[217:59.23]Oh, there was a Knight Rider out here the whole time.
[218:00.89]We probably could have killed him in this time.
[218:03.06]Do we have time?
[218:03.66]No, right?
[218:04.44]Not now.
[218:06.46]Vinny, check this out.
[218:07.28]Unless we, like, if he aggro's to the circle.
[218:09.87]Oh, I see a fucking baby.
[218:12.79]I don't even need it.
[218:14.27]Okay, I'll take it.
[218:15.83]If you're not gonna use it.
[218:16.45]You gonna try to go for it, Ster?
[218:19.00]I wanna see if he follows me back.
[218:21.42]We could kick the shit out of him fucking fast if we aggro him.
[218:23.86]That's what I'm saying.
[218:34.50]Just keep pulling him to the right.
[218:41.25]Keep moving him to the right.
[218:45.79]Try to aggro him a little bit so we can actually get whatever he drops.
[218:50.36]Even if he gets on the horse.
[218:54.65]Ster, you're kind of in there.
[218:56.43]I know.
[218:56.93]Help.
[219:02.34]He's going to die.
[219:03.14]He's dead.
[219:03.86]Yeah, we're not going to pick up that stuff, are we?
[219:06.08]Well, Ster will get something.
[219:09.26]I mean, I'm just going to go grab it.
[219:12.12]Yeah, just grab it.
[219:12.96]You can heal.
[219:13.74]I got stamina recovery.
[219:17.01]It's very helpful.
[219:22.29]Well, I'm glad I did it.
[219:25.86]This is the strong-ass normal guy.
[219:27.70]Watch out for normal guy.
[219:29.54]Yeah, that kind of just ate through all of my heals.
[219:39.45]Whatever.
[219:39.83]Alright.
[219:45.67]I'm out of mana.
[219:51.94]Dude, we are going to be destructive.
[219:58.84]I'm feeling really potent.
[220:00.13]I feel like I haven't felt this potent in a while.
[220:02.93]Warming stone on me.
[220:03.89]Warming stone on me.
[220:12.30]A nice bathing glow of light.
[220:16.84]Bewitching branch mist briefly makes allies of foes.
[220:22.99]Huh.
[220:24.51]Interesting that.
[220:25.39]Alright, this one sucks.
[220:26.21]Oh god.
[220:26.73]It's alright.
[220:27.19]Oh god.
[220:33.62]Which one are we targeting here?
[220:34.79]The big one?
[220:35.71]Or one of the cavalry?
[220:37.93]We should probably split them up.
[220:39.53]Whatever you can get.
[220:41.16]Yeah, fight one on one if you can.
[220:47.41]Uh, well, there he's fucking dead.
[220:54.94]Yep.
[220:56.06]You bet.
[220:57.47]Wow.
[220:59.01]Wow.
[221:08.24]I think I'm just distracting the big guy.
[221:09.94]Holy shit, what is that damage, you guys?
[221:12.18]We are, um, doing good.
[221:14.95]We...
[221:16.67]Wait, what are we doing?
[221:17.78]We're doing good.
[221:18.20]We're doing good.
[221:19.06]We're doing good.
[221:25.89]Now that they're dead, you need to stop them from this.
[221:30.48]You're healing.
[221:48.50]Oh, fuck him up.
[222:00.80]Boom.
[222:00.98]Don't.
[222:01.34]Think.
[222:01.68]Thought twice about that, huh?
[222:03.60]Let's see what I can do here.
[222:17.61]Ooh, I thought it was the axe.
[222:43.33]I think we kind of pulled this out of our ass.
[222:45.63]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[222:47.63]I really think that sewer boss, we got like so lucky it was the shitty guy too.
[222:51.48]God, that knife is so good.
[222:54.94]Chat, what do I do?
[222:56.46]Poise or FP?
[223:00.19]Also chat, what do I do?
[223:04.29]Also chat, what do I do?
[223:07.66]I don't know.
[223:09.46]Damage negation sounds nice.
[223:10.78]I'll take it.
[223:14.53]This dude's fucking horse is just here.
[223:20.84]He let it get away.
[223:22.40]I tried to get it, but no, no, no dice.
[223:25.62]Alright, I'm gonna drink.
[223:26.36]We need like a range.
[223:30.67]Alright, I don't think we have a range character.
[223:33.27]No, no, no, we don't.
[223:34.49]Alright, my butt is painful.
[223:36.99]I gotta move my butt around.
[223:39.52]Like in real life?
[223:41.24]Yeah, I sat for too long.
[223:43.10]Yeah.

[226:21.77]We're good.
[226:24.63]He's turning to you, I think.
[226:33.43]This has been the absolute worst I've fought this boss.
[226:37.01]It's alright.
[226:41.89]alright first switch I wonder if I can parry any of these okay that just sucks that attack is so good

[228:19.19]No!
[228:22.05]Fuck!
[228:22.29]Oh, how did we do so bad?
[228:24.19]Oh, no.
[228:25.23]We had such good items, too.
[228:26.68]What happened?
[228:28.66]Oh, no.
[228:29.72]I thought he was... I was absolute dead weight.
[228:35.58]Oh.
[228:36.87]I don't know.
[228:37.19]That character just feels so slow against that boss.
[228:40.49]Did you know you can heal?
[228:41.59]Oh, alright, chat.
[228:42.89]Got it.
[228:44.11]Got it.
[228:45.94]Rub salt in the wound.
[228:47.62]Oh, if I had just turned the camera a little faster, I could have seen him coming.
[228:55.59]Well, you're the only one alive.
[228:56.53]Where do you think he's going?
[228:58.46]Buster.
[228:59.08]I know, but it's the... I know.
[229:03.32]I thought he was far enough away.
[229:05.23]Fuck.
[229:07.01]Yeah, I was trying to restore magic, like mana, and I didn't heal.
[229:11.08]So Chet is right.
[229:15.72]God damn it.
[229:17.40]That was such a... Weren't you in dog form?
[229:20.93]I was for a bit.
[229:21.79]I took damage.
[229:22.53]I came back out of dog form.
[229:23.91]It was just a bunch of unfortunate shit.
[229:27.47]I took too much damage in the beginning.
[229:29.72]I went through like four flasks in the beginning.
[229:32.22]I'm fucking infuriated.
[229:35.36]Yeah.
[229:37.50]Well, that was a good attempt.
[229:40.49]It's a shame that chat was right.
[229:41.97]What do you get out of chat being right, though?
[229:45.62]like does it make you feel good because I don't feel good you don't feel good no one feels good chat okay anyway hey guys how do I spend that 1500 it's apparently something I can unlock you buy the random relics from pot guy pretty much
[230:04.98]Unless you want to unlock one of the other characters.
[230:07.04]I got time for one more.
[230:08.10]The revenant.
[230:08.87]Let's make this the one.
[230:10.57]How do I unlock another character?
[230:13.03]It's a whole process.
[230:15.78]I would just get relics for now, to be honest.
[230:18.80]Okay.
[230:18.92]And you get duchess when you beat that boss once, I think.
[230:24.35]I'll be right back.
[230:28.24]Alright.
[230:28.46]Someone said save 1500.
[235:03.01]Get that.
[235:03.51]Yeah, I get that.
[235:05.89]Alright, I... I grabbed a stress ball and I squeezed it and the thing popped.
[235:14.10]It's very strong.
[235:18.37]It was a blueberry.
[235:25.06]Alright, I guess we're ready for the expedition.
[235:28.22]I'm gonna go back to Mage.
[235:31.83]because I'm a piece of shit where you belong I got one of the relics that starts you with a stone sword key which is how that gamer gamer had it so fast what does that mean what do you get from that uh you need a stone sword key to open the ever jails
[235:58.49]And they're usually pretty good at a bind.
[236:00.46]Oh, right, yeah.
[236:00.80]I was gonna say I've never done an Evergale, but turns out I did.
[236:04.36]I played as 200 hours of Elden Ring, and I'm like, what is that?
[236:09.95]You're having some issues.
[236:14.33]My life needs work.
[236:16.43]This game needs work.
[236:20.06]Sorry.
[236:21.58]No, it's true.
[236:22.36]Honestly, this one kind of does too, yeah.
[236:25.54]A little bit.
[236:26.08]I mean, it's getting a patch real soon, so...
[236:29.66]If I were to wave a magic wand and change the game, I would, and this is just me, I would increase the time for the circle to drop from, what is it, 40 minutes?
[236:48.18]I'd make it like 45 or like 50.
[236:50.76]Just to give you a little time to explore and not feel stressed?
[236:56.59]I just want a little bit more time.
[237:01.17]Even like one minute.
[237:02.21]41.
[237:02.55]41 minutes.
[237:04.59]Right.
[237:06.43]One extra minute in each area accumulates to about an extra five to seven minutes.
[237:14.52]But that's just me.
[237:15.52]That's all.
[237:15.98]That's just me.
[237:17.15]Why did you disband the team?
[237:20.29]Uh, I didn't.
[237:21.49]It seems you've left.
[237:22.53]Just you left.
[237:24.67]Oh, God.
[237:28.08]Can you re-invite?
[237:30.37]Can you rejoin on your own without my help?
[237:32.75]Yes, I can.
[237:33.57]Mr. I need more time.
[237:34.65]Well, then take your time coming back.
[237:36.67]I'm coming.
[237:37.43]I'm right here.
[237:41.44]I personally enjoy the frantic pace and the necessity to go quick.
[237:44.92]But, you know, I guess you're bringing up the classic Dark Souls.
[237:48.25]Like, when are we going to get an easy mode?
[237:51.53]Alright, I'm back.
[237:54.07]Someone said it should be like Risk of Rain 2, where you can just stay in a level as long as you want, but it just keeps getting harder.
[238:01.28]That seems like a fair compromise, but... I never loved the concept of the closing thing, but I understand its necessity.
[238:12.33]Yeah.
[238:18.24]Yeah.
[238:21.31]stirrup I guess we're waiting for you yeah I know I have no like good yellow no good yellows I'm sad I didn't even get to use my old in that fight the res people because we just exploded yeah you know what again my chat listen they were mean to me but they were right for some reason I didn't heal I was like you know what was going on there something's going on you're doing raider
[238:48.80]something's going on yeah should I I'm just asking oh yeah dog okay dog alright they should replace the birds at the start with a flying balloon bus skins would be cool like if you could fly in a ufo in the beginning
[239:19.10]I think that would really fit the game.
[239:20.87]That's what I'm saying, we need a real money cash shop.
[239:24.31]Dollar bill cash money shop.
[239:28.68]We need a game that gives you money every time you win.
[239:34.81]Real money.
[239:35.67]And lose.
[239:39.02]Oh, so like, okay, so you can join a game for a dollar, and like, you know, 10,000 people join.
[239:46.27]and then, like, the top 10 people make actual money.
[239:49.38]I think that's just gambling, right?
[239:52.24]Also, hackers and, like, cheaters, it would just, it would never, ever work.
[239:57.85]Sounds great.
[240:00.62]Um, I kind of want this.
[240:02.84]I guess you do it.
[240:06.93]Yeah, I'm signing up for the next Squid Game.
[240:10.64]Dude, would you squid game if it meant that you would live?
[240:15.47]Forever?
[240:16.73]No, just like you wouldn't die from the squid.
[240:20.97]Well, that kind of like takes a lot of the stress out of the situation.
[240:24.98]Yeah, I'd have like a fun like party.
[240:26.92]That sounds cool.
[240:31.42]Make sure you're leveling up your character at this grace.
[240:35.25]I'm trying to get shit done.
[240:38.82]Do you think... If... Do you... I don't even know which one of you is doing the duck.
[240:44.69]That's how... That's how crazy... We do a similar duck.
[240:50.25]You're supposed to double up the duck.
[240:52.55]I can already do two ducks at the same time.
[240:54.50]Listen.
[240:59.28]It's a double duck.
[241:00.18]You can't just turn your lawnmower on, dude.
[241:04.83]Hey, I'll do one.
[241:06.94]Alright, ready?
[241:08.32]Two, three.
[241:13.61]Can you attack the enemy maybe, Jerma?
[241:15.59]My head was turned 180 degrees sideways.
[241:18.07]I couldn't.
[241:19.31]I'm going to turn your head sideways with a fucking fist.
[241:23.08]Oh, wow.
[241:24.32]Yeah, really?
[241:25.32]Okay.
[241:25.94]Oh, big guy over here.
[241:30.39]Whoa.
[241:33.40]Yeah, getting bigger every day.
[241:34.52]Why are you following me?
[241:36.42]I don't know you think you're part of the posse can you what are we doing we gotta go lost without me are we looking for a church healing church I like that voice Jerma the healing church of your honor of latter-day saints
[242:05.93]Are these real lines from the game?
[242:17.25]I don't remember.
[242:19.21]You don't even remember the character you played, so... Apparently not.
[242:23.30]Apparently I was a mage.
[242:26.18]Also swordsman.
[242:33.00]Alright.
[242:36.74]Where would you guys put on kind of generic lines that an older fantasy character says?
[242:44.58]Where would you put my son or my sons?
[242:47.30]I think the only reason I think of that as a common thing is because anytime you start doing that voice, it's like a 90% chance you do a my son.
[242:55.93]That's not true.
[242:56.39]This is new to me.
[242:57.27]I've played a lot of games with Jerma by now, but I still haven't heard my shot voice.
[243:02.14]I think it takes some, uh... I've heard the Yogurt voice, the Tom Hanks voice.
[243:06.06]That's a good one.
[243:08.36]I do that now, by the way.
[243:09.77]That's, like, your fault.
[243:10.63]You want these stabs.
[243:12.31]Loretta's Great Bow.
[243:14.01]Freezing Mist.
[243:14.63]Oh, Freezing Mist fucking goes hard, bro.
[243:17.48]Dude, Freezing Magma Shot!
[243:19.66]I'm taking Freezing Mist.
[243:20.86]Hey, you're not a mage!
[243:23.04]I scale within.
[243:24.02]I actually do.
[243:28.82]I can't even... Nice.
[243:36.29]I need to suck some mana out of somebody.
[243:41.32]We're good.
[243:42.62]Oh, Carrion Glintstone.
[243:46.08]My son.
[243:46.98]My sons.
[243:48.61]Carrion Glintstone.
[243:50.89]The fate of the realm.
[243:52.05]Realm is another one.
[243:53.33]Like, if you're going to do that kind of voice, realm.
[243:56.68]Realm.
[244:00.98]I have to be level 3 for this?
[244:04.03]Okay, fine.
[244:05.63]Weird, I'm already level 3.
[244:07.38]Well, I'll have 21... souls.
[244:16.34]Alright, we gotta follow Ster.
[244:26.28]Oh, so I just jumped off the castle.
[244:28.22]My character did a forward roll.
[244:30.08]And, you know, obviously there's no fall damage.
[244:32.07]But tell me if I've told you guys this story.
[244:34.81]But in Ocarina of Time, you know how Link can do a forward roll and not take any damage?
[244:39.63]You know about that?
[244:40.47]I don't know anything about that.
[244:42.20]I'm trusting you, though.
[244:43.52]I used to jump off... Grock, is this true?
[244:46.38]I used to jump off my garage when I was, like, a kid.
[244:51.21]And it was, like, a good, like, eight feet.
[244:53.94]nine feet and I would do like a forward roll into the grass to negate damage like in real life and you know what I did it a number of times and I never took damage I was always okay so I mean I'm glad I didn't push my luck too much but I'm still here still feel good still healthy at 40. oh eight feet or nine feet yeah I could have just stepped down alright
[245:17.60]Well, I mean, you know, for a kid, that's like a mile.
[245:21.22]Dragon!
[245:22.01]You want to fight a dragon?
[245:23.61]Dragon!
[245:25.27]I will level up and then we can drag the story on.
[245:27.60]I need to level up first.
[245:29.74]Grace is right here.
[245:30.52]I can start fighting it and see if it's a good idea.
[245:33.27]Your grace.
[245:38.58]There's too many buttons in this game.
[245:49.56]I don't think that did very much.
[245:51.58]What the fuck did I just do?
[245:52.62]I summoned a tombstone and it didn't... What?
[246:00.38]Oh shit, that's Glintz.
[246:02.48]Oh God.
[246:03.08]I did not know that's what this was.
[246:04.90]How are we feeling about this damage?
[246:09.39]I think we can do it.
[246:12.30]It's just, it's not... It's not ideal.
[246:20.29]Extra damage incoming.
[246:24.73]I shouldn't waste my tombstone.
[246:27.00]Whatever it does.
[246:27.70]I'm dead.
[246:33.28]I don't think we're killing this fast enough.
[246:35.75]Let's go down into the mines.
[246:39.85]I'll just follow you.
[246:43.94]I don't know what I'm doing.
[246:49.30]Where is it?
[246:52.80]Gravity stone.
[246:54.44]I don't see it.
[247:01.67]Where is it?
[247:06.18]This is time we could have been killing the ancient hero of Zamor.
[247:12.01]Are you still looking for the mine entrance?
[247:13.57]I don't know where the entrance is.
[247:14.95]They're always so weird to find.
[247:21.31]I walked into that why use dex weapon with big strong man then I guess we can do whatever this thing is also there's kind of a good point dig sites I don't know what that is either we got to do something yeah let's kill the zamora hero

[248:27.08]There's like jelly beans up... Jellyfish up here.
[248:29.88]And they're dropping shields and shit.
[248:37.37]Is Vinny hearing me talk or... What are you doing?
[248:40.31]Oh, you're killing the Zamora.
[248:42.54]Oh, fuck.
[248:45.28]I wasn't listening to anything either.
[248:46.64]I was just trying to kill that guy.
[248:48.18]I was looking for jelly beans.
[248:49.33]Hang on.
[248:50.05]Sorry, guys.
[248:51.82]Gonna find the other Zamora's circle soon.
[248:54.13]Where are you guys?
[248:55.09]How are you even... Where are you... Down... Where?
[248:57.57]We're in the ruins.
[249:00.05]I know, but how do I get down to that area?
[249:01.86]Big axe.
[249:05.64]Oh, I see.
[249:09.97]Big axe down here.
[249:12.27]Big axe would be good for my guy.
[249:13.65]See any more Zamora's, sir?
[249:18.10]Yeah, I'm fighting one.
[249:25.69]I'm doing my part.
[249:29.54]I pressed the wrong button by accident.
[249:45.65]One more somewhere.
[249:59.63]It's always hard to actually find these guys in the ruins.
[250:05.08]I almost wish there was an extra minute or two in each area.
[250:08.96]I feel like finding these guys is always a pain in the ass.
[250:14.79]Sometimes they fall off the cliff.
[250:16.51]He's over here.
[250:19.96]Oh, come on.
[250:22.24]Where's this guy?
[250:23.15]Oh, there he is.
[250:40.60]Uh, yep.
[250:42.06]Greatsword.
[250:44.63]Round slam.
[250:45.43]Improved attack power when two-handing.
[250:47.41]Oh, I want that.
[250:48.49]Or physical attack.
[250:49.61]Oh, there's the entrance.
[250:50.75]It's midway down the cliff.
[250:53.52]Do we have time to still do this?
[250:56.24]Uh, is this the full circle coming in?
[250:57.80]I don't... I think it is in a few minutes.
[251:00.70]We can try to get in there quick.
[251:01.77]Oh, no.
[251:02.17]Yeah, this is it.
[251:02.81]We can, like, pop our head in the front.
[251:05.05]I don't think we should.
[251:10.54]but here we go I guess whatever I've fallen behind and I don't know where you guys are we don't have time for that you don't have time for me to be lost no okay I'm there go to a blue marker I'm here oh god the dragon is here again oh careful

[252:46.70]Yeah!
[252:50.21]Yo, what if Golem was jacked?
[252:52.50]I think that a lot.
[252:55.50]Swollen.

[252:59.61]Where's my precious?
[253:02.35]Bro.
[253:04.63]Bro.
[253:05.01]Bro.
[253:22.15]Rot produced a mist of scarlet rot.
[253:26.89]Spinning slash.
[253:33.34]And now, rot!
[253:38.29]Got him.
[253:39.09]Nice one, Vin.
[253:40.39]I didn't do shit.
[253:42.11]I missed every attack I hit.
[253:43.24]That was a big hit.
[253:43.68]That was big.
[253:44.58]Thanks, man.
[253:45.06]I hit every... I missed it.
[253:54.41]Fine.
[254:04.27]Demi-human!
[254:13.58]What does this fucking tombstone even do?
[254:15.46]What is the point of the tombstone?
[254:17.59]Don't ask that.
[254:20.49]You can get your, like, mage to stand on it.
[254:23.10]It's kind of good, but... It's kind of good, but... Nice.
[254:51.45]Nice.
[255:02.38]I'm frothing.
[255:11.59]I'm rotting.
[255:14.38]I'm frothing.
[255:22.77]I'm dying as well.
[255:23.77]I'm spinning.
[255:24.13]I'm spinning.
[255:26.41]It's tempting to spin.
[255:27.21]I'm locking onto random enemies I don't want to lock onto.
[255:29.94]Ooh, big hit, baby!
[255:31.98]Luigi, we got this!
[255:36.28]Oh, man.
[255:37.76]Oh, my goodness.
[255:38.82]Want to know how I feel about that fight?
[255:44.05]That.
[255:44.59]That's how I feel.
[255:45.61]Get it?
[255:46.63]I didn't get it.
[255:47.49]I took the Raging Stars.
[255:51.75]Attacked enemies die regardless of remaining HP on rare occasions.
[256:00.28]That sounds rarely useful.
[256:02.64]Poisoning our scarlet rot in vicinity continuously restores HP.
[256:12.59]I wonder if Comet Azura really does just suck ass.
[256:18.06]Find out.
[256:20.16]Day 11.
[256:22.96]What people are getting timed out?
[256:23.84]What is it?
[256:24.54]Is chat going crazy?
[256:25.40]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[256:27.57]My chat said they're repeating something I said.
[256:30.15]No, that's something else.
[256:33.55]Oh.
[256:33.63]Hey guys, we're going to grab this hawk and you're going to put your controller down.
[256:39.42]I need to.
[256:39.82]We're going to fight the misbegotten.
[256:41.77]That's what we're going to do.
[256:43.59]Sounds good.
[256:45.95]Poke asked if we killed the boss.
[256:48.18]No, we got really close.
[256:51.48]I messed up.
[256:52.84]Are you guys here?
[256:53.58]No, Vinny messed up.
[256:54.77]I messed up.
[256:55.27]Is anyone playing?

[258:19.55]It really just takes you where it shows it's going to.
[258:22.27]That's not on my screen.
[258:25.60]I don't see it.
[258:26.16]What do you mean?

[259:32.95]This daemon.
[259:42.97]Rot produces a mist of scarlet.
[259:44.83]It changes fury.
[259:52.19]Oh my God, what the... I'm so stupid.
[259:55.22]I'm such an idiot.
[259:57.18]I'm so dumb.
[259:59.22]I thought there was way less people in here.
[260:02.40]But there's like a hundred guys in here.
[260:18.88]There are literally hundreds of men here.
[260:24.93]Oh, that is what is what is that chat?
[260:27.88]I just like pour blood onto myself.
[260:35.97]You must complete the ritual.
[260:38.55]Why does it say hurt Bob?
[260:41.47]We should probably keep going.
[260:43.03]We got a. But head over here and we gotta get.
[260:49.04]He's technically still in the circle, so we should be fine, right?
[260:52.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[260:58.16]Oh, is he the guy that's at the top of the castle?
[261:00.92]Possible or no.

[261:23.53]I'm going to summon a tombstone that'll that'll show him.
[261:33.36]Where are we?
[262:01.66]This is the goofiest FromSoft boss ever made.
[262:05.24]Oh my God, I am actually dead.
[262:12.31]I have injured his poise, but I don't know where the weak spot is.
[262:15.39]We have to get Jeremy up.
[262:16.62]I'm dying.
[262:17.54]You get him up.
[262:19.26]I'm trying to... Alright, dude.
[262:21.06]I was just about to hit him.
[262:22.44]I'll be alright.
[262:25.31]Okay, Commodusaur.
[262:27.05]That is not worth doing.
[262:30.14]Where's Jeremy?
[262:31.63]He died.
[262:31.99]I'm here.
[262:33.83]I was like, I died?
[262:34.91]Yeah.
[262:35.27]You're not in the boss fight?
[262:36.09]There's a timer.
[262:37.29]I got you.
[262:55.55]I need my souls.
[262:58.66]He is like, every time he hits me, I am one health away from getting one shot.
[263:11.74]Oh, come on, dude.
[263:13.32]I ran into it.
[263:15.44]I'm going to lose another fucking level.
[263:21.95]Unless, Vinny, you can kill him on your own.
[263:32.33]You are working here.
[263:34.61]Trying.
[263:37.10]Look at you.
[263:38.24]I got eaten.
[263:39.60]I'm in his mouth.
[263:40.22]I'm in his mouth.
[263:40.90]I'm dead.
[263:42.12]We'll get you.
[263:52.08]Oh my God.
[263:54.80]I couldn't hear.
[263:55.98]We're all dead.
[263:56.76]Oh, what the fuck?
[264:00.51]Does it retain the health we've taken away from it?
[264:03.41]Yeah.
[264:04.63]We do lose a level.
[264:06.24]God damn it.
[264:08.02]All my abilities are fucking dog shit.
[264:11.40]Circle's closing in on it, I believe.
[264:13.58]Oh no, that circle was always there, wasn't it?
[264:20.67]Let's fucking jump.
[264:22.94]Good thing I have a tombstone I can summon.
[264:28.24]being mad about it like I don't know what it does still I'm like I it just you you go a little bit higher and you can like jump on your enemy's head which I can see being useful for like a couple of enemies but make sure you get your souls by the way it's a lot of wheels oh I'm down and I did not get my souls yet so I hope that this does not this is not fun I got fight it again I got fight it I got I am bided and I am dying
[265:01.51]He's dead.
[265:01.95]Where are you, Vinny?
[265:02.57]Get me, get me, get me, get me.
[265:03.87]No, me!
[265:04.68]I can't.
[265:05.56]He's body blocking.
[265:06.14]He's body blocking.
[265:09.02]I couldn't run through him.
[265:12.08]I could not run through him.
[265:15.63]I like Vinny more too.
[265:18.31]The hell?
[265:21.21]No, more than me.
[265:21.89]Like, what?
[265:24.67]Level six.
[265:26.03]Yeah, we got fucked there big time.
[265:28.30]We got screwed.
[265:32.36]I gotta get rid of one of these.
[265:33.82]This is the most useless two fucking weapons.
[265:36.47]These are all also not helpful at all.
[265:42.44]Normally I would get the finger chat, but... Yeah.
[265:49.01]That's way better.
[265:52.03]Maybe you want that sword, I don't know.
[265:55.93]The strength weapon or I don't know.
[266:00.70]That's that's that's GG.
[266:02.16]Mary's lost all hope and motivation is the light in his life and eyes are gone.
[266:08.73]That sums it up.
[266:09.61]I mean level 6.
[266:11.89]Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[266:14.29]There's a blacksmith here.
[266:15.25]If you ever had any souls to spend or if you were zero souls at level 6.
[266:21.74]Anyone want deaths, poker or the rapier?
[266:25.21]not really can um if I buy this Smithing Stone chat can it upgrade my blue weapon here or no anybody know how these work no I don't know
[266:55.15]Let's see.
[266:55.91]By the equipment slot.
[266:59.43]No.
[267:09.80]Okay.
[267:09.92]Yeah, I don't even think I got the souls from the... From the boss?
[267:13.14]Oh, no, because I was dead when the boss died.
[267:16.47]So, yeah, no, I lost.
[267:17.33]That's fucked up.
[267:18.19]I didn't see them on the ground, though.
[267:21.01]Oh, no, they were.
[267:22.09]Okay.
[267:23.79]I gotta move.
[267:24.49]Pull them.
[267:26.03]We're two.
[267:27.19]Oh, God.
[267:27.77]Oh, God.
[267:28.25]Oh, God.
[267:33.28]This game is giving me Elden Finger once again.
[267:36.27]Like, I have my thumb.
[267:39.85]My left thumb starts to kind of really hurt when I play this game.
[267:44.64]Oh, that's cool.
[267:47.21]Where you at?
[267:50.37]Doesn't seem this is going well.
[267:51.89]Hold on.
[267:54.77]Wait, what?
[268:01.54]Was that not getting you?
[268:03.52]No.
[268:03.80]What the fuck?
[268:06.52]Level check.
[268:08.31]Level seven.
[268:11.07]Wow, you're ahead of me.
[268:13.17]I mean, I guess I missed like fucking everything.
[268:15.63]I guess I could try to get my souls back, but I'm not going to.
[268:26.81]improved guarding ability talisman on the ground where walk fast we're in deep shit yeah that's also day two so there's like I should be double this level after this fight
[268:55.91]Losing levels seems like a miserable mechanic.
[268:59.19]It is.
[269:00.83]Yeah.
[269:02.22]I think it's pretty cool when you play well and then things go well.
[269:08.13]What he said.
[269:17.02]Do we know where a good enemy is or area waiting for the circle?
[269:24.66]Misery doesn't mean bad.
[269:30.81]Misery just means miseries.
[269:51.67]Oh, the misery.
[269:54.97]Every single buddy wants to be... My friend.
[270:00.98]That's a nice twist.
[270:27.91]This fucking video game.
[270:34.76]This fucking game.
[270:36.02]Yeah, tell me about it.
[270:47.44]Man.
[270:55.79]No wait guys I got this tombstone Love that move I'm died somehow.
[271:16.68]I don't know Thank you
[271:25.10]Not again Yikes, that's a lot of bullshit I'm out of the fucking circle I almost have a health bar Be careful he's gonna do the big reds
[271:55.03]You don't want to get hit by the big reds.
[271:56.94]You don't want to get hit by these careful.
[272:00.04]Those are bad to get hit by.
[272:20.17]Oh my God, give me a fucking break.
[272:33.29]We could really use a tombstone right about now.
[272:36.12]Don't got one.
[272:40.99]What?
[272:41.11]I think that would solve all our problems.
[272:46.58]Oh, get in there.
[272:59.06]For how, like, bad we've done?
[273:01.38]Like, this went well.
[273:03.59]He's gotta die.
[273:05.27]Except, uh... Ster, get the final hit.
[273:10.34]Ster, kill it.
[273:11.51]Ster, kill it.
[273:13.03]Ster?
[273:16.86]Yeah!
[273:19.65]OK, we're going to crawl to each other.
[273:22.37]Crawl kiss kiss.
[273:25.17]You gotta get us up man.
[273:26.95]Please, we're going to die here.
[273:32.60]Oh.
[273:36.43]The tombstone gives a damage buff to your allies.
[273:40.21]Nearby.
[273:42.84]Oh.
[273:44.70]I didn't know that.
[273:46.85]usually when the tombstone comes up I like run away because it's so awkward yeah now it's amazing we're on level three oh no yeah that's what I'm saying that's right I'm level six in here I'm eight hey even more like the like the start of day two that tree serpent was just such a piece of man I'm so mad about it very unlucky timings on some of the deaths
[274:17.26]I'm not loving this character and the way I'm playing him either.
[274:24.48]But that's also a me problem.
[274:28.97]Spinning stone one.
[274:36.68]Alright.
[274:37.10]I guess we're going to go for it.
[274:39.96]Got to try.
[274:40.44]I'm jumping off.
[274:44.18]Don't do it.
[274:47.38]Buy meats?
[274:49.66]That background is the Soul Calibur final boss stage of every Soul Calibur ever made.
[274:58.45]I can see it.
[274:59.58]I can see it.
[275:00.78]Now, have you guys ever had this experience where your fridge just doesn't work?
[275:11.59]Yeah, actually.
[275:12.35]It sucks.
[275:13.88]Okay, cool.
[275:14.42]Just checking.
[275:15.02]Just checking.
[275:15.53]Especially when it stinks from old chicken.
[275:22.64]Alright.
[275:25.64]Let's go.
[275:27.20]Yeah, we got it this time, guys.
[275:29.67]Massive DPS.
[275:31.31]I know we do.
[275:32.01]Play well.
[275:34.73]Die well.
[275:39.90]Oh, I already fucked it up.
[275:49.11]That's good damage.
[275:56.10]I mean, the saving grace for me is that I got a Moon Veil.
[276:02.75]That's true.
[276:03.23]We're doing fine.

[282:54.01]Alright, so now what do we do with all of you?
[282:58.12]I will keep playing this.
[283:01.26]I'm going to play it probably mid to late next week.
[283:04.85]I do have to get a bunch of House Flipper stuff ready, so I probably won't be playing it a ton.
[283:10.63]But I will be playing it.
[283:12.65]Maybe throw some Oblivion in there too.
[283:19.54]But yeah, that's going to be it for today.
[283:22.28]I'll see you guys probably late next week, mid-late next week.
[283:28.95]There will be a couple of House Flipper streams and probably this and maybe some Oblivion.
[283:39.97]See you soon.
[283:40.33]Take care.
[283:40.77]Thanks for hanging out.
[283:43.07]I do think it's fun.
[283:43.67]I do like it.
[283:46.06]It's just one of those games where everything's got to go right.
[283:51.54]And getting used to the new control scheme is admittedly is taking a little bit of extra time.
[284:00.59]Having my brain decide that up is now what square used to be has been a problem for two days.
[284:07.83]And then a new combination of holding this button and then that button.
[284:12.91]But, like all things, you just have to get used to it.
[284:19.45]I think it's really fun, though.
[284:20.33]I think if you get a group of three...
[284:23.10]I wonder what the patch is going to be next week.
[284:26.43]They said, we got a big balance patch, and we're going to change this, and we're going to change that.
[284:29.82]I wonder what it is.
[284:30.90]So, we'll see.
[284:36.51]Take care.
[284:37.21]See you soon.
[284:38.21]Have a good one.
[284:40.42]Bye-bye.
