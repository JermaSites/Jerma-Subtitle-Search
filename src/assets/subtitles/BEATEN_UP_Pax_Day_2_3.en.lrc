[00:00.96]Going into battle, full armor.
[00:04.19]Going into battle, ass.
[00:13.32]Hi guys, what is, oh God, my fucking voice.
[00:16.48]Did you hear that?
[00:17.64]Hi guys.
[00:18.24]Sup guys, what's going on?
[00:19.62]My name is Orb and my voice is destroyed.
[00:23.90]Can you hear this right now?
[00:25.66]I'm sounding so manly and tough or like puberty all in one.
[00:30.22]It's fantastic.
[00:31.14]Anyways, it is day two.
[00:34.07]Pretty much just like finished getting ready and we had quite an experience, if I'm gonna put it like that, quite an experience
[00:41.77]This morning.
[00:42.73]And you know what?
[00:43.11]I'm just gonna throw it over to Jerma.
[00:44.85]So he's gonna explain.
[00:45.63]And you're gonna see something.
[00:47.16]When I get closer to him, you're gonna see something that kind of... You might not like.
[00:50.92]So if you can see... Jesus fucking Christ.
[00:53.72]I can't believe this actually happened.
[00:54.78]Let me show the eye.
[00:55.84]The eye?
[00:56.44]Oh, God.
[00:57.49]So, yeah, as a lot of you guys know, if you know me from my channel, I'm a champion boxer.
[01:02.11]Round one, this was against Muhammad Ali.
[01:05.35]He went in a time machine.
[01:06.53]He's kind of old, isn't he?
[01:07.51]No, but he went in a time machine, and he came back, and I was, you know, boxing him.
[01:10.66]Long story short, I beat him.
[01:12.08]I mean, it was a tough fight, but, you know, he was crying at the end.
[01:15.62]And he was actually wearing, like, glass knuckles, so that's why, like, this happened.
[01:19.90]Glass knuckles?
[01:20.52]No, the real story is... Yeah, can we please get to that there?
[01:23.20]I woke up this morning...
[01:25.51]6 a.m.
[01:26.63]Stone cold's over, like nothing was wrong.
[01:28.73]I felt fine, drank plenty of water, and I was completely and totally fine.
[01:32.35]I have low blood pressure.
[01:34.31]So sometimes when I get up, I, you know, a lot of you guys might have this too, where you get up after sleep and you're like, whoa, the whole world closes in on you.
[01:42.81]Yeah, you feel like you're gonna like... You feel like you're gonna fall.
[01:44.77]Yeah.
[01:44.99]You feel faint.
[01:45.45]So that happened to me.
[01:47.43]in the bathroom and it's kind of unclear what really went down but what I heard from like the bed the uh the shower door which is this like this makes quite a bang hear that yeah we think I must I I don't I can't memories are coming back pretty slow but I must have come up to go to the bathroom and don't go pee and then
[02:08.55]When I turned around and probably come out of the bathroom, it was like, it hit me right there.
[02:12.93]And I probably went face first right into the wall.
[02:14.75]It's fucking crazy.
[02:16.27]How many stitches?
[02:17.05]It's eight.
[02:17.63]One, two, three, four, five, and then six, seven, eight.
[02:19.73]Can you imagine?
[02:20.51]Oh, welcome.
[02:21.09]Let's go to PAX and let's go get like our face fucked up.
[02:23.64]Like, oh, great.
[02:24.96]Where the lady's at?
[02:25.80]It's fucking nuts.
[02:27.24]Alright, so as you can see, like, not a fight, not anything, just fucking, like, he's, you're the most unfortunate person in the world.
[02:35.28]I mean, if I'm not the most unfortunate, I'm close, I'm pretty close to being one of them.
[02:39.40]Crazy.
[02:39.82]Alright, so with that, we are now going to, yeah, after we're now shaped up as well as we could, we're now gonna grab some food, hit up for some more band-aids, I think, and then, yeah, we're just gonna go to the event, and I don't really know what the plan is for today as...
[02:56.25]We got quite a scenario here, but I'm guessing we're gonna be telling the story to a lot of people today.
[03:46.65]Hey guys, trying to vlog for PAX.
[03:48.57]It's kinda loud in here so I kinda have to scream.
[03:50.43]But yeah, having a great time at PAX, it's great.
[03:53.00]I'm enjoying myself.
[03:54.60]Me and Jerma is probably gonna go check out Twitch booth right now.
[03:57.78]So that is what we're gonna do.
[04:04.56]I'm gonna show this off.
[04:21.07]A large, a large, still nice.
[05:31.46]Hi guys, that is gonna be it for PAX.
[05:34.16]Me and Jerem are in the cab and we're just leaving.
[05:36.17]I don't know if you can see.
[05:37.91]Maybe not.
[05:39.09]Yes, we're leaving PAX.
[05:41.45]It's been like a crazy couple of days.
[05:43.91]I know I've promised you guys a video from each and every day.
[05:47.48]Not sure if I will be able to deliver on that because there's only so much content you can record and see and stuff.
[05:52.28]What's happening tonight?
[05:57.11]I think we're going to the Hard Rock.
[06:00.19]The Hard Rock.
[06:01.51]There's a little meet-up going on there.
[06:02.75]There's a social.
[06:03.39]Is that what you call it?
[06:04.07]A social.
[06:04.59]A social, I guess.
[06:05.77]But yeah, it's been like crazy.
[06:07.13]It's been a lot of fun.
[06:08.43]Like, I did not expect so many people to show up for the meet-up since, I mean, I'm based out of Europe, so seeing a lot of, I mean, smiling faces, it's a real treat.
[06:18.81]It's awesome meeting viewers and fans and people alike.
[06:22.69]I mean, people that, for instance, me and Jerma, like, we talk.
[06:25.19]Is that hard?
[06:26.21]Yeah.
[06:26.59]Trying to do it.
[06:27.43]That's kind of a squiggly heart, but yes.
[06:30.20]I mean, it's awesome.
[06:31.32]Like I was going to say, me and Jerma, for instance, we talk online, but it's like, it's a pleasure to meet the people that you talk to online.
[06:42.65]And yeah, that's going to be it.
[06:43.93]We're going to sign up.
[06:44.99]Yeah.
[06:46.43]Signing off.
[06:47.77]Oh, that sounds really bright.
[06:49.53]Oh, we need to see the light.
[06:50.57]It's coming in.
[06:51.57]It's a nice, like, it's a nice ending.
[06:55.52]Yeah.
[06:56.36]The sun is setting.
[06:57.94]The event is over.
[07:00.12]But yeah guys, that's gonna be it.
[07:01.18]So I hope you have enjoyed everything that has to do with PAX.
[07:03.94]I sure have.
[07:05.24]And hopefully I will see you at the next PAX East event.
[07:09.26]Maybe even PAX Prime.
[07:10.80]What do you think, baby?
[07:12.62]I think Warp should go to PAX Prime.
[07:13.96]What do you think, should I?
[07:15.36]I don't know.
[07:16.12]You'll have to convince me.
[07:17.04]But anyways guys, that's gonna be everything.
[07:19.20]Later.
