[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.84]Am I seeing a bunch of- finally crack time crack time crack time finally it's crack time!
[00:09.16]Are you just sitting there waiting to smoke crack?
[00:13.44]Like you've got your crack on the table and your crack pipe or your crack device?
[00:17.74]Are you just sitting there like a napkin is laid out in front of you?
[00:21.98]Come on come on start the stream dude!
[00:27.44]He's late.
[00:28.18]I can't smoke this crack until he's here.
[00:30.94]God damn it.
[00:34.36]Oh, life, life.
[00:38.02]Oh, yeah.
[00:38.66]Do we have to wait?
[00:44.32]Oh, finally, crack time.
[00:52.44]Anyways, how are you?
[00:57.25]Just like crack work.
[00:59.33]Crack.
[01:02.46]God damn it.
[01:04.70]Yeah, we're going to play more House Flipper today.
[01:06.52]For an undetermined amount of time.
[01:11.72]I might get bored in 30 minutes and we play Desperados 3.
[01:14.68]Or I'll be here for another 5 or 6 straight fucking hours.
[01:17.94]And then we're going to do... We're just going to keep doing it.
[01:20.97]I don't know.
[01:26.58]Am I going to just Sly Cooper?
[01:27.70]I don't know.
[01:37.01]Sly Cooper.
[01:41.85]You got to put that in the list of games that are similar to... And I know people are going to be like, did he just... Hold on.
[01:51.24]I put, like, Jack and Dexter.
[01:54.96]And Dexter and Jax.
[01:57.66]What's that other one?
[01:58.60]There's two.
[02:00.12]Ratchet and Clank.
[02:02.07]Ratchet and Clank, Jack and Dexter.
[02:07.33]I feel like that's like a tag team fight.
[02:11.79]Okay, so that's very different.
[02:17.00]Jekyll and Hyde.
[02:17.94]Okay, I thought you said take that back.
[02:21.62]You said say hi back.
[02:23.20]Hey, how are you?
[02:26.96]They were competing platform mascot games.
[02:31.44]Yeah.
[02:31.82]I don't know.
[02:33.28]Sly Cooper just kind of fits there in my brain.
[02:35.70]With like other mascot platformer games.
[02:40.32]Although you don't have a gun or anything.
[02:41.63]Don't you just jump around and
[02:46.28]I only like Jack 1, and they're all great.
[02:48.56]I know, I haven't played them.
[02:49.60]I'm sure I will eventually.
[02:51.52]On stream.
[02:55.80]If you delay the stream by 5 minutes, I have to empty the litter box.
[03:01.11]It's going to probably take 5 minutes to go do it now.
[03:03.51]It's going to take probably 5 minutes before I get into the game.
[03:09.97]This dude's a pathological liar.
[03:13.01]No, I'm a pathological forgetter.
[03:16.26]There's a huge difference.
[03:17.44]You can play PlayStation Heroes.
[03:28.05]No, I haven't.
[03:33.43]That's a lie.
[03:34.05]You're going to play Fall Guys?
[03:38.51]No, not today.
[03:40.23]Not today.
[03:41.25]I can't.
[03:42.62]I can't do it.
[03:43.30]I cannot win.
[03:45.97]I finally pulled out of the 7-Eleven parking lot.
[03:51.28]That is like $42 scratch tickets.
[03:55.46]I don't think I'm gonna win.
[04:04.79]He's a selective pathological forgetter.
[04:14.02]You just described, like, a patient in a Leslie Nielsen movie.
[04:21.57]What's the prognosis, doctor?
[04:23.31]Well, he's a selective pathological forgetter.
[04:26.59]Interesting.
[04:27.01]Did you just who Leslie Nielsen?
[04:33.95]I want to ban that guy.
[04:36.79]Are we getting a who on Leslie Nielsen?
[04:39.39]A who?
[04:40.37]A who on Leslie Nielsen?
[04:43.27]Oh boy.
[04:46.65]Do yourself a favor, just go watch every Leslie Nielsen movie from start to finish.
[04:50.27]And I'm even talking about the ones that are in black and white that weren't comedies.
[04:53.21]Go watch those too.
[04:54.11]Watch them all.
[04:54.62]Watch this whole catalog.
[04:55.46]He has like a hundred movies.
[05:03.44]Ooh.
[05:03.84]I told that person that they could empty the litter box.
[05:06.58]Look.
[05:07.52]We haven't even done anything.
[05:15.57]The Naked Gun movies are a pretty major influence on what I think is funny.
[05:23.54]I used to watch those all the time.
[05:25.26]Airplane movies?
[05:27.96]Huge influences.
[05:36.97]Spaceballs?
[05:38.37]Kind of the same era.
[05:51.23]I love the Naked Gun series.
[05:53.23]It was just ridiculous.
[06:00.42]He made so much money just being the guy that was dead serious in absurd situations.
[06:06.90]It was just Leslie Nielsen was going to look at something with a stern face and be completely deadpanned while a clown honked a horn behind him.
[06:15.57]It was awesome.
[06:22.63]Is that Police Squad show?
[06:23.95]Yeah.
[06:24.83]That was what it was before, right?
[06:27.13]No, no, no.
[06:27.37]What was it?
[06:27.69]It was... What was before?
[06:31.96]Naked Gun was the movies based on a TV show that got canceled, right?
[06:38.06]That's the one, right?
[06:38.70]Yeah, Police Squad was first, yeah.
[06:47.86]Wait, what are you ResidentSleeper-ing?
[06:53.48]ResidentSleeper?
[06:56.40]Just go watch it.
[06:57.16]Okay, you could ResidentSleeper me on this topic, but go watch Naked Gun.
[07:03.25]And I bet you that ResidentSleeper face turns into like a hog mouth in about 45 minutes.
[07:17.86]uh leslie nielsen who naked gun ResidentSleeper now I'm gonna be 40 soon alright let's go let's play welcome back everybody hope you're having a good day hey hope you're having a good day what does that mean I say that a lot although I think a lot of people say that like when they broadcast when they make videos hey guys hope you're having a good day

[07:48.70]Alright, here's the Aqua Teen house.
[07:50.96]Because every house is a fucking cartoon house.
[07:54.75]I seriously couldn't stop thinking about this.
[07:57.13]I couldn't stop thinking about this the whole night.
[08:01.51]I didn't even want this to be a cartoon house.
[08:03.77]But like the title says, it's always a cartoon house.
[08:06.43]Always.
[08:06.69]Hey, Mystic Quests.

[09:52.81]Alright, I'm gonna move on after this.
[09:54.37]We gotta play.
[09:58.60]Is this because I took the week off?
[10:00.74]I didn't take a week off.
[10:01.84]I took two months off.
[10:30.25]This is fucking ridiculous.
[10:32.13]Okay, alright, I gotta- let's get grounded here.
[10:37.35]He's on vacation again.
[10:38.69]I wasn't on vacation.
[10:41.90]Alright, time to get to work.
[10:46.62]You guys are grounded.
[10:47.44]Okay, so I have to take a wall down.
[10:49.70]I cannot- this can't be Meatwad's room.
[10:53.97]But I have practiced the voice, okay?
[10:59.38]What are you doing, Shake?
[11:00.62]Get out of my room!
[11:01.77]I don't want you in my room, Shake!
[11:05.09]No, I don't think so.
[11:06.99]I think I want to get out of my room!
[11:09.75]I've been working on the voice as of yet.
[11:11.23]It took me about four hours to get that correct.
[11:21.54]He did that yesterday.
[11:22.66]I didn't do the high part.
[11:23.98]I didn't do the... What are you doing?
[11:25.72]I didn't do that one yesterday.
[11:26.86]I did the low one.
[11:29.90]It took me two hours in the bathtub saying that into the ceiling.
[11:38.36]To get that right.
[11:40.65]But I have to... I can't do this.
[11:41.83]This has to change.
[11:42.65]This is... I can't... This cannot be the Aqua Teen house.
[11:44.69]I'm sorry.
[11:45.39]I have to get rid of this.
[11:47.07]I have to take this wall down.
[11:50.75]This cannot be an Aqua Teen house.
[11:54.19]No.
[11:54.75]No.
[11:55.37]It's not happening.
[11:56.29]I don't care.
[11:58.35]Every house cannot be a cartoon house.
[12:00.23]Not every house.
[12:00.77]It's not going to be, oh, do Family Guy, do The Simpsons, do Aqua Teen, do the American Dad House.
[12:06.67]No, this is my house.
[12:08.61]My house is not a cartoon house.
[12:11.07]There's no sound.
[12:14.47]Oh, shit.
[12:14.89]Sorry about that.
[12:29.15]Full blast.
[12:31.27]Okay.
[12:32.15]I'm sorry.
[12:32.79]I'm sorry.
[12:33.33]I'm sorry.
[12:33.67]That was fucking loud.
[12:34.69]I know the sounds are loud.
[12:36.93]I didn't have the desktop audio pulled down a little.
[12:41.81]What OST are we going to listen to today?
[12:43.21]How about the Aqua Teen Hunger Force OST?
[12:51.66]I'm not muted.
[12:52.28]What happened here?
[12:57.04]Who chipped this tooth?
[13:01.80]Alright, what if the house is just a giant garage?
[13:04.24]Okay, what if this is a house for a car?
[13:07.78]Like, you pull the car in, and you pull the car in, and you turn right, and then you drive straight, and you pull in into the bedroom, and you just sleep in the car.
[13:17.12]And if you have to go to the bathroom, you have to, like, drive into another room, and, like, just pee out your window.
[13:26.84]A drive-in house.
[13:28.90]Yeah.
[13:29.10]Yeah.
[13:34.72]Okay, this house makes sense in some weird dystopian future where we have to stay in our cars.
[13:40.75]Because there are like weird aliens outside that will implant themselves in your brain if you get out of your car.
[14:01.03]This is a post-5G world.
[14:05.43]I mean, I'm talking more about like... It's just like aliens.
[14:10.67]And the aliens don't understand the cars.
[14:13.58]For some reason, right?
[14:14.46]That's like the weird plot of the movie.
[14:17.02]It's like for some strange reason, the aliens do not understand cars.
[14:23.38]And they're afraid of them.
[14:24.32]They won't go near them.
[14:28.96]Kind of like how... Ah, that's a spoiler.
[14:31.66]I was going to make a direct reference to a movie, but the whole thing I'm about to say is a spoiler.
[14:40.59]Alright, this is the first.
[14:45.45]Let's make sure we can make this turn.
[14:49.71]Say it.
[14:50.13]No, I don't want to say it.
[14:51.01]I don't know.
[14:51.63]People like movies.
[14:57.02]Open it.
[14:58.71]Slime already did this bit.
[15:03.63]Just give a spoiler warning.
[15:05.31]Okay.
[15:05.97]I'm going to give you a spoiler warning, okay?
[15:08.15]This is a spoiler warning for the movie Bird Box.
[15:13.38]Okay?
[15:21.64]I'm about to make a major talk about Bird Box.
[15:26.06]Okay?
[15:26.28]Are you ready?
[15:30.73]Put it on screen.
[15:35.53]This, alright, this is why, this, this, this is like in the poster of the movie.
[15:38.87]I don't, why do I need to, I don't need to, what the fuck do I care?
[15:43.13]This is, this is in the poster of the movie.
[15:44.69]It, it, it's, um, Samantha, what's her name?
[15:49.47]Famous, incredibly talented, famous actress, why, what's her, Sandra Bullock, right?
[15:55.44]Nobody cares about Bird Block.
[15:56.72]Some, one of you does.
[16:00.95]Who cares?
[16:01.57]Who cares?
[16:02.33]No, you don't understand.
[16:03.37]People care about this shit.
[16:04.59]Do you know how much direct email I've gotten about spoilering?
[16:09.98]Like the Lord of the Rings?
[16:12.72]I've gotten like seven pieces of fan mail that were not fan mail at all, by the way.
[16:16.66]They lied in the subject.
[16:18.14]It was like, dude, such a huge fan.
[16:19.62]Click me.
[16:20.20]I love you.
[16:21.35]I'm like, oh, cool.
[16:22.75]And I click it.
[16:23.21]It's like, you fucking asshole.
[16:24.71]Fuck you, dude.
[16:25.51]I was on the last book.
[16:27.69]And I had no idea that Sauron was the eye.
[16:33.11]Piece of shit.
[16:36.37]I'm just like, dude, I'm fucking... Okay.
[16:51.95]Wait, it's like in the menu.
[16:56.96]Like the devs.
[16:58.34]Okay.
[16:59.34]I got to tell you about this.
[17:00.42]I am so fucking annoyed with this movie.
[17:02.21]We got to continue game.
[17:03.21]We got to move the... Bird box spoilers.
[17:05.25]Click here if you want to see them because I got to tell you.
[17:06.95]It's my review.
[17:07.61]Alright.
[17:12.18]Anyways.
[17:13.36]No, but that's good.
[17:17.80]Here we go.
[17:19.77]Okay, so in the movie Bird Box, here comes the whole movie.
[17:22.74]In the movie, I'm not gonna tell you the whole movie.
[17:23.80]In the movie Bird Box, this, these, this aliens invade Earth or something.
[17:29.26]And you can't look at them.
[17:31.68]They haven't, they didn't figure out that, like, you have eyelids.
[17:34.56]You cannot look at them.
[17:36.48]If you look at them, you're in big fucking trouble.
[17:41.43]You're, you're in a lot of trouble if you look at them.
[17:45.15]But for some reason, they didn't figure out that if everyone walks around with their eyes closed...
[17:49.42]They can just walk around and like stab people that don't ever see it coming.
[17:59.20]Oh wait, no, the whole point of the movie was the birds in the box.
[18:01.91]The birds like chirped when they were around.
[18:03.89]Oh yeah, the writers figured that part out.
[18:05.79]That's right.
[18:06.83]Yeah, the writers like figured out a way to make it so like they couldn't just walk up and stab people.
[18:11.99]Right.
[18:12.65]Okay.
[18:16.32]That's the whole point of the movie.
[18:17.28]It's in the title.
[18:20.40]That's not what the movie was about.
[18:22.93]What?
[18:24.11]What are you talking about?
[18:29.77]Wait, that doesn't happen in Bird Box?
[18:35.76]That's not Bird Box.
[18:36.76]That's a different movie.
[18:39.60]What do you mean?
[18:40.24]What movie am I thinking of?
[18:45.36]Wait, so there's not a bird in bird box that tweets, that chirps when the monsters are around.
[18:51.02]Yes, there is.
[18:55.80]Is this a different movie?
[18:59.49]That spoils a different movie?
[19:02.41]What movie?
[19:07.83]No, I'm being gaslit.
[19:09.09]Alright, this is gaslighting.
[19:10.20]Okay.
[19:15.05]Where was I going with this?
[19:16.98]What are you guys doing to me?
[19:19.26]Why'd you guys say that thing about Bird Box?
[19:22.08]What did you do that for?
[19:24.88]He's pretending for views.
[19:26.44]No, that's what happened.
[19:27.94]Long story short, in the movie Bird Box, you have to keep your eyes closed, and the aliens have not figured out a fucking way of how to, like, how to get somebody to open their eyes.
[19:38.09]So they don't know.
[19:38.51]They just stand around until you open your eyes.
[19:40.47]So imagine, like, that your eyes are the car.
[19:48.12]No, it doesn't.
[19:57.35]What is he doing with the house?
[20:01.21]No, this is gas.
[20:01.75]Yeah, I'm being gaslit.
[20:03.03]I'm saying that the aliens cannot figure out how to get you out of your car.
[20:07.37]Just like how they couldn't figure out how to get you to open your eyes in Bird Box.
[20:13.58]That's what I was saying.
[20:16.79]So you drive around in your fucking car and you have to live in your car house because the aliens don't know how to get you to- they don't understand your car.
[20:23.41]That's not a spoiler.
[20:24.97]That's a basic presence of the pre- pre- pre- presence of the movie.
[20:33.81]Okay.
[20:43.63]Okay, so in this world...
[20:46.52]Two cars.
[20:47.98]Like, does everybody in the family have their own car that they drive around the house in?
[20:53.02]And if you want to go, like, get breakfast, like, oh, here comes, like, little Timmy coming down the stairs in his car.
[21:00.09]His house is not big enough for that.
[21:01.21]This is supposed to be your house.
[21:11.27]It is.
[21:13.53]I don't like... It's the Aqua Teen thing that fucks me all up.
[21:16.29]I don't want an Aqua Teen house.
[21:27.94]Okay.
[21:29.54]Now, how am I going to do this?
[21:34.87]I'm not going to sell it.
[21:35.79]I'm not going to lose my money on it.
[21:40.42]That's not a spoiler.
[21:41.94]That's the basic premise of the movie.
[21:46.80]That's what I was saying, but you don't understand the fucking hate mail that I've gotten.
[21:49.52]Okay.
[22:03.70]I want to pick this up.
[22:04.66]Just sell the damn thing.
[22:05.56]What do I care?
[22:07.68]Yeah, this was like fun for a little while, but like who cares about me making the stream room?
[22:15.86]This is the garage.
[22:17.14]The garage leads down to a basement.
[22:21.57]The basement leads into a larger room and then a bathroom.
[22:26.75]Okay.
[22:27.47]There's a bathroom down here.
[22:29.11]This should just be the house.
[22:30.01]Should I just have a dummy house upstairs?
[22:32.13]For, like, the burglars to go into if there's ever, like, a burglar or something?
[22:34.99]Just a fake house with a bunch of fake money?
[22:38.60]And then my house is down here.
[22:45.78]It's all just, like, weird cardboard furniture and shit, but, like, my actual house is down there.
[22:49.66]I'm not gonna sell these computers yet.
[22:59.02]This is a Fortnite house.
[23:02.36]No, this is not a Fortnite house.
[23:04.36]Because if I was building it like a Fortnite house, I'd be doing this.
[23:06.99]Okay, so I want to... Let's make a fake living room.
[23:25.10]TV's gonna go here.
[23:25.86]This is the only logical place for it.
[23:27.92]This house is pretty small.
[23:29.56]You go into the front door.
[23:30.52]You need... There's a little kitchen.
[23:33.06]This isn't gonna be a kitchen.
[23:34.76]What's this?
[23:36.38]This is like another weird room.
[23:37.93]This room is just... Why do they all have... Why does every room in this house have a back entrance to the backyard?
[23:42.59]That's kind of weird, right?
[23:52.32]I don't like that.
[23:57.08]I can't put that down here?
[23:59.80]Why can I not put that down?
[24:00.80]Do I have to destroy this?
[24:06.73]I can't destroy this either.
[24:07.65]So... Alright, I'm just gonna put a wall here.
[24:13.61]And then I'll paint, like... I'll paint just... The outside can just be painted.
[24:19.33]It's fine.
[24:22.22]Here comes a spoiler for House Flipper.

[27:21.37]And this room's gonna be the pre-room to my actual house.
[27:27.12]And now I'm gonna put, like, a sign up here that just says, like, toxic fucking, toxic waste.

[29:32.16]I think there should be like a whole streamer slime family.
[29:45.15]And they like switch off who's going to stream today.
[29:47.15]Because what I think when I think of like the main streamer, which is like slime, like just slime dad.
[30:00.60]I'm thinking of, like, Slimer.
[30:03.38]Just, like, a disgusting Slimer.
[30:05.36]That looks like he's barely functioning.
[30:08.12]Like, he's barely able to even stay upright.

[32:35.17]Well, no, all it takes is like 400 people to be spamming links.
[32:40.41]And that's when you get my attention.
[32:41.59]Okay.

[33:58.23]Better, better, better, better, better, better.
[33:59.73]Okay.
[34:03.45]And the walls are changing that.
[34:10.61]God damn it.

[34:12.76]I can't get the doctor's office out of my mind.
[34:15.08]Should I do this?
[34:16.28]Change the walls.
[34:19.85]Jeans.
[34:20.53]Make a jeans house.
[34:21.83]Denim ground.

[35:46.55]It's tiny.
[35:52.61]No.

[36:51.07]It is!
[36:51.51]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[36:52.78]Okay.
[36:54.08]This is my favorite kind of bunk bed.
[36:55.98]Because it's a bunk bed without the other asshole underneath you.
[36:58.44]Perfect.
[36:59.48]Perfect.
[37:05.51]You know, I almost wish this was reversed.
[37:08.43]I don't want my bed this close to the ceiling, but I would like sit up there.
[37:12.51]I don't care about that.
[37:13.33]I want to like climb up to my desk and sleep down here.
[37:18.57]That'd be cool.
[37:22.51]Like you climb up and there's like a platform and you sit up here.
[37:26.45]I think that would be pretty... I want to be closer to the ground.
[37:33.01]I don't want to be sleeping up here.
[37:34.21]It freaks me out.
[37:36.53]No, not gray.
[37:37.25]Alright, blue.
[37:39.86]We're going to go with the blue.
[37:42.76]The blue looks good, especially in a house that's gray.
[37:45.02]There we go.
[37:45.70]Perfect.
[37:46.00]Okay, this just encompasses everything I told you guys I wanted in a house.
[37:54.74]This is really all I need.
[37:57.84]You ready?
[37:59.18]You have a place to sleep.
[38:01.39]Up top.
[38:01.95]Right there.
[38:03.17]You have a place to do your work.
[38:04.77]Right there.
[38:05.11]You just need a chair.
[38:06.39]You've got exercise.
[38:07.77]You can climb up and down that thing like ten times.
[38:11.81]You have storage.
[38:13.59]Shoes.
[38:14.25]Clothes.
[38:17.65]You have a toilet.
[38:18.85]You could just piss in that.
[38:21.07]Just have a hole in the ground.
[38:23.33]There's your shoes and your clothes.
[38:25.09]You can slide that and there's a hole in the ground.
[38:27.47]You can just pee into it.
[38:28.17]It's a toilet.
[38:32.28]And just give me a TV right there, right in that big rectangle in the middle.
[38:42.95]It's perfect.
[38:44.90]TV right here, and you just, like, go in here and sit and watch.
[38:48.72]Where would a kitchen be?
[38:53.86]Uh, you just order McDonald's every day.
[38:58.51]You don't... Who cooks?
[38:59.75]What do you mean?
[39:01.15]It's bad placement?
[39:02.13]Yeah, it kind of is.
[39:12.86]That's a little better.
[39:17.26]No, it's not.
[39:22.88]It needs to be, like, a little bit... What about the closet?
[39:25.74]Oh, fuck.
[39:26.79]Yeah, it needs to...
[39:31.11]Okay, where do I put my hamster hotel?
[39:34.27]The thing that I want so badly.
[39:35.95]I can't put it anywhere.
[39:36.85]It doesn't fit here.
[39:42.88]Here?
[39:43.08]I guess it fits right here.
[39:54.31]Walk in the window, but, you know, whatever.
[40:00.12]Maybe that goes in another room.
[40:07.34]I know a lot of you guys are talking some serious shit right now, but if you woke up and you kind of went to the bathroom and you opened up a door and there was a McDonald's play place behind one of the doors in your house, you don't think that you would go in there and just fuck around all the time?
[40:33.60]Of course you would.
[40:36.73]Hamster.
[40:37.07]Yeah, the hamster house.
[40:38.07]Imagine if you could go into a person-sized hamster wheel and just sprint around your house and smash the fuck into walls and you'd be fine.
[40:47.36]You'd just sprint in this bubble and could just go anywhere and just run into stuff.
[40:54.40]Chat's lying.
[40:55.00]Oh, I know.
[41:01.79]Okay, that's fine.
[41:02.99]Now let's go with... I want to put blinds on there, but not blinds.
[41:08.99]I hate blinds.
[41:10.33]I want just regular curtains.
[41:13.85]A mountable narrow curtain.
[41:15.49]There.
[41:15.71]And we can make this room pop by adding a little bit of orange.
[41:26.63]It needs to be bigger than that.
[41:31.74]It needs to be wide curtain.
[41:34.90]Mountable, short, wide curtain.
[41:44.02]What's wrong with that?
[41:44.58]Is the bed in the way?
[41:47.16]Where are the curtains?
[41:57.06]Oh.
[42:04.86]Perfect.
[42:17.06]I just- I only have this in here because I want it, not because it makes sense in the room.
[42:34.01]Not big enough.
[42:34.49]Alright, I can fix that.
[42:36.59]This is fixable.
[42:37.33]Honey, we've got to take the wall down so I can fit my hamster bed.
[42:52.80]Um, can we just get a regular mattress that we can- No!
[43:00.42]Excuse me, you did not say McDonald's Play Place.
[43:17.90]Just move the door That's too late This room just got much bigger
[43:37.97]Oops.
[43:38.97]I swung and hit the wrong part of the house.
[43:45.86]This is why you never do your own project.
[43:51.32]This is one of those scenarios where it's just like... Okay, let's start our project.
[43:58.36]Here we go.
[43:59.10]We've got our tools.
[44:01.04]Cut to the ambulance.
[44:04.25]Cut to in the emergency room.
[44:07.08]Where I'm on five different machines.
[44:17.73]He's flatlining.
[44:20.65]Okay, this has to be like this, though.
[44:25.15]Cut to a funeral.
[44:30.25]Does that have the same weight?
[44:32.34]How did he die?
[44:34.82]We don't know.
[44:35.46]That could be years in the future.
[44:40.03]If you cut to the funeral of the guy, it's like, oh no, he died.
[44:43.91]And then it goes back to their house, and what an amazing looking, incredible project that they did.
[44:49.51]By the way, the funeral is like from two, three years after they completed this awesome project.
[44:56.48]You gotta have context there.
[45:02.60]I don't think you cut to the funeral.
[45:08.45]Grimma has died of construction project.
[45:10.61]Alright, here we go.
[45:14.04]Perfect.
[45:16.64]Now this room becomes longer.
[45:21.57]Like this.
[45:30.42]Trust yourself, man.
[45:31.38]Don't fucking listen to what anybody says.
[45:33.40]Did you do it like this?
[45:35.92]Yeah, you did this.
[45:37.04]Don't listen to fucking anybody.
[45:38.12]Telling you you can't fucking do it like this.
[45:39.98]I can fucking do it.
[45:41.49]See?
[45:42.01]Don't let anybody tell you you can't do that.
[45:46.15]Can't do it because it's too close to the... It's too close to the window.
[45:52.89]Oh my god.
[45:54.97]It's alright.
[45:55.37]I can make this a corner.
[46:02.25]This is gonna be a corner.
[46:03.87]People do that, right?
[46:04.61]It's disgusting.
[46:27.62]It is not disgusting.
[46:33.60]See?
[46:33.82]Problem completely solved.
[46:43.43]There.
[46:44.59]Oh, looks actually really good.
[46:52.04]Cracks.
[46:52.74]Cracks.
[46:53.08]LOL.
[46:55.52]You guys have any idea what's surrounding you in your house right now?
[46:57.98]You know how many cracks, how many broken, like, pieces of wood are just surrounding you?
[47:02.00]You know how many dead animals are surrounding you right now?
[47:06.20]Right now, there are probably, like, ten different dead bugs and animals surrounding you in your walls.
[47:14.63]There's a squirrel that's dead in your wall that's a skeleton that's been there for probably 45 years.
[47:19.61]And it's less than five feet, probably, away from your face.
[47:26.18]So, crack in the wall that I'm covering up.
[47:28.32]Oh, it's not a big problem to me.
[47:40.76]How do you know that?
[47:44.90]Look it up.
[47:50.64]Okay, let's put this back.
[47:53.40]You put them in there.
[47:54.32]No, you can't.
[47:54.84]How do you put something in a wall?
[47:59.93]Wait, so you're telling me that you think that you knock upon, you go cut into your drywall and like place a, like an object in there and then put the drywall back up.
[48:13.70]Well, for what reason?
[48:16.24]Like, I did what?
[48:16.74]I just open up the drywall and dump, like, 5,000 crickets in there?
[48:21.98]And then seal it.
[48:23.66]Yeah, that's what I did today.
[48:27.75]Why'd you do that?
[48:28.83]I don't know.
[48:32.55]Shit!
[48:33.45]Is it big enough?
[48:34.05]Alright, you can reach it.
[48:38.58]It's not big enough.
[48:39.66]It's not big enough.
[48:40.52]Wait, can I turn it the other way?
[48:42.93]You're fine.
[48:43.97]You're fine.
[48:45.21]You can fit in here.
[48:45.99]Just only open this one and then duck.
[48:48.96]And then kind of get your body inside of it.
[48:51.70]And then get your clothes.
[48:53.70]You have to close this one first and then leave.
[49:01.39]It's fine.
[49:01.77]The person using this is going to be like this tall anyways.
[49:04.87]Yeah, you.
[49:05.85]Yeah.
[49:08.47]Wait.
[49:08.93]Get that out of here.
[49:12.21]Wait, can I take this down and just go one more?
[49:14.27]I can go.
[49:18.23]No, I'm going to fix this.
[49:19.77]This is my dream house.
[49:20.81]What are you talking about?
[49:21.69]This is my dream fake house above my real dream house.
[49:36.84]Okay, so right here is where I can safely open this.
[49:41.59]We're good.
[49:42.41]Close it up.
[49:48.37]Perfect.
[49:55.66]There we go.
[49:56.42]I don't fucking listen to anybody.
[50:02.47]You can't do that, Jeremy.
[50:03.05]You can't.
[50:03.45]What are you doing?
[50:04.07]You're an idiot.
[50:05.85]Shut up.
[50:06.23]I can fucking do it.
[50:07.49]I can do whatever I want.
[50:08.91]I'm not going to tell you anything like that ever again.
[50:12.04]Listen to anybody.
[50:15.58]Hey, it worked!
[50:21.36]What was he talking to?
[50:24.03]Oh.
[50:24.21]Okay, I need paint.
[50:26.49]We're doing a better paint, too.
[50:28.11]I want something nicer than this.
[50:30.49]I don't want it too dark, though.
[50:36.69]No greys.
[50:37.27]Get away from the gray.
[50:41.37]Ink mist?
[50:50.02]Just black.
[50:51.60]Every room.
[50:55.46]Is blue like an azure bliss or a sleep?
[50:58.78]I think sleepy blue.
[51:03.90]Baby blue?
[51:07.28]Let's try sleepy blue.
[51:11.11]I want to get this right.
[51:20.83]Wait a minute here.
[51:21.39]Hold on.
[51:21.95]Hold on a minute here.
[51:23.71]Wait a minute here.
[51:31.36]Hold on a minute here.
[51:33.49]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[51:33.95]1, 2, 3.
[51:34.11]Hold on.
[51:34.49]Wait a minute here.
[51:36.03]1, 2, 3, 4.
[51:36.45]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[51:36.61]What color is this?
[51:38.23]Paint.
[51:38.39]It was forest mist, right?
[52:06.52]Okay.
[52:06.82]1, 2, 3, 4.
[52:07.54]1, 2, 3, 4.
[52:07.82]1, 2, 3, 4.
[52:07.90]Nice.
[52:08.06]Then that means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[52:09.50]So we need one here or up there.
[52:39.54]Can I paint it?
[52:39.90]What's wrong with this?
[52:50.57]And I want like a green too or something.
[53:02.66]What looks better?
[53:03.22]Green?
[53:04.90]I need to see what this looks like.
[53:07.33]Jermo, Jermo, hurry up!
[53:08.49]No, I'm making my dream fucking fake house, okay?
[53:10.52]Looks terrible.
[53:25.21]This is why I can't design anything!
[53:27.10]I, like, don't get it!
[53:29.92]My design philosophy is put a different color line in here.
[53:34.66]I don't know.
[53:35.14]That's why everything's gray.
[53:36.04]That's why all my floors are gray.
[53:37.76]Everything in my whole house is gray.
[53:41.47]I don't understand.
[53:42.43]I don't get it.
[53:47.01]Should I do like a line, line, line?
[53:51.67]Or like one wall should be... Hold on.
[53:53.99]What if I do one whole wall?
[54:04.45]Okay.
[54:04.79]That looks alright.
[54:06.31]Do all blue.
[54:13.01]That's not too much though.
[54:28.07]Oh, then I know.
[54:29.75]We can put little cloud artwork all over here.
[54:35.32]Yeah.
[54:38.23]Yeah.
[54:43.05]Like every baby boy's room in America.
[54:49.28]Cloud, cloud, cloud, rainbow, frog.
[55:03.42]Cloud, cloud, cloud, rainbow, frog, demon!
[55:07.00]How do I get rid of this?
[55:29.35]Oh, this is gonna- it's gonna pee through the walls here.
[55:31.37]Alright, thank you.

[56:11.15]What about the dinosaurs?
[56:12.09]Yeah, we're gonna put, like, dinosaur action figures on here.
[56:14.78]No!
[56:15.12]They better not be expensive, whatever they are.
[56:16.72]They better be cheap.
[56:20.54]Oh, wait.
[56:21.08]You know, you guys talking about the stealing furniture?
[56:22.98]You can't steal this.
[56:26.08]This shit's not- It's bolted to the ground.
[56:28.45]This doesn't come up.
[56:34.99]Change in the floor.
[56:49.00]Better be cheap.
[56:49.61]Yeah, it better be cheap.
[56:59.15]Put concrete in here.
[57:05.19]Bolted furniture is in prisons.
[57:06.89]No, it's not.
[57:08.25]It's in people who want to make sure that their stuff is secure.
[57:10.31]It doesn't move.
[57:10.95]Can I open and close these?
[57:22.46]Oh, you can't close and open these?

[58:57.22]It's not even a person's room, though.
[58:59.49]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, a DVD player.
[59:05.32]This is a perfect, perfect fake IKEA room.
[59:10.29]Where you lean over here, and you go, oh, and you touch this, and it's hollow, and it's like, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[59:37.65]DVD player.
[59:38.95]I gotta get the fuck... I have to get out of the house now.
[59:40.57]DVD player?
[59:41.27]No.
[59:41.81]This house sucks.
[59:42.87]Wrong one.
[59:45.07]Who uses a DVD player in 2020?
[59:46.45]This house sucks.
[59:52.36]perfect okay what other like just like fake like plastic ikea furniture thing can we do here decorations now here's the thing should I make it like a game for them should they be like a two like two hundred thousand dollar painting like hidden in all the bullshit
[60:21.61]Alright, hold up.
[60:22.21]Pictures and paintings.
[60:27.32]Put it somewhere, like, random.
[60:29.18]Like, there's no reason why you would care to look over here.
[60:33.48]Okay, yeah.
[60:33.94]Here's what I'm gonna have.
[60:34.68]This is the plan.
[60:35.76]I'm gonna put, like, a $200,000 painting behind the wicked shitty stove.
[60:41.16]Like, down here.
[60:43.02]All you need to do is just move the plastic IKEA furniture and it's like, holy shit, there's a Mona Lisa back here.
[60:50.35]I mean, you gotta give them at least something.
[60:53.63]I mean, I'll have like five of those downstairs.
[61:01.82]Bathroom?
[61:02.32]There's no reason for a bathroom up here.
[61:06.68]What would there be a bathroom up here for?
[61:09.12]It's not a real house.
[61:13.60]Okay, imagine coming into somebody's house and you only have like a few minutes.
[61:20.57]You're running around like, okay, what am I going to steal?
[61:22.59]Okay, that's... Where's the bathroom?
[61:27.25]You would question everything.
[61:32.11]This is... Yeah, somebody just said, this is a game show house.
[61:36.33]This is a house that's made.
[61:37.37]This is a set.
[61:38.95]And exactly, yeah.
[61:40.13]But why would there be a functioning toilet up here?
[61:45.66]There's no reason to have a functioning toilet.
[61:47.42]This is gonna be another bedroom.
[61:49.24]Or like a closet or something.
[61:50.74]Alright, we're not down here yet though.
[62:01.15]Use the toilet backstage.
[62:09.29]Shit, I spit everywhere.
[62:17.16]Put kitty litter in the corner.
[62:19.64]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[62:20.72]If I can do it, I'll put like ten litter boxes over here.
[62:24.44]So you come and you go, oh, there's a lot of cats in here.
[62:26.84]A lot of cats in this house.
[62:30.74]But where are they, though?
[62:32.10]Where are the cats?
[62:34.16]Why are there no cats?
[62:36.24]Paint the top of the windows.
[62:38.10]I knew somebody was going to be like... Alright, let's go.
[62:47.43]You get the vision.
[62:48.15]You get the vision.
[62:49.73]That's good.
[62:54.47]What was it called?
[62:55.49]Sleepy blue.
[63:05.62]You're making a crack den.
[63:09.02]No, this is a fake house upstairs and then the real house is downstairs.
[63:13.54]Which...
[63:15.21]I guess could be a front for a drug operation, now that I think about it.
[63:22.13]Yes.
[63:23.01]You, I guess like... Ding dong!
[63:27.35]What's going on here?
[63:28.13]Uh, nothing.
[63:31.61]Yeah, hmm, nothing actually, you're right.
[63:34.69]Hmm...
[63:38.53]What's going on downstairs?
[63:40.11]You don't have to go down there.
[63:41.21]It's just storage.
[63:43.53]That's what the fake room before the real room is for.
[63:46.49]This is going to be a bunch of boxes and storage.
[63:49.21]Guys, I'm five steps ahead of you.
[63:54.25]That looks good.
[63:58.74]Always the same voice.
[64:01.15]Don't you get it?
[64:01.71]Whenever I'm talking about somebody that's not me, they either sound like this, they sound like this, or they sound like this.
[64:08.15]There's only three other people that I've referenced.
[64:10.23]It's always the same three people.
[64:25.30]That's the easiest way for me to differentiate that it's not me talking.
[64:29.33]Because if I go, think about that, right?
[64:32.05]If I don't make some type of differential voice to who I'm talking to, I'm a different person speaking, then me saying this, uh, yeah, yeah, the paint looks good.
[64:42.09]Look at that paint.
[64:42.71]Yeah, okay, good job with that paint.
[64:45.15]Hey, welcome to the drug den.
[64:46.29]I do drugs downstairs.
[64:48.19]Hey, officer, yeah, come on in.
[64:50.21]Yeah, go.
[64:50.61]Don't look downstairs, though.
[64:51.57]There's drugs everywhere down there.
[64:54.47]Oh, that's the storage.
[64:55.15]Just storage down there.
[64:57.24]You understand how that doesn't work now?
[65:00.60]That's just me saying that.
[65:02.48]It has to be somebody else.
[65:03.48]It can't be me.
[65:03.98]Alright, that room's pretty good.
[65:08.74]Maybe another decoration.
[65:13.56]It's just me saying it.
[65:18.48]Is that part of the stream?
[65:19.82]Or is that a cry for help?
[65:22.50]See, you get it now.
[65:24.42]No, it's not that.
[65:36.47]It's the voice.
[65:37.19]It's the other voice doing it.
[65:39.19]I can push all of my insecurities through the other voice.
[65:44.07]I'm just sitting here watching the stream with you guys.
[65:50.75]Gas mask.
[65:52.58]Alright, let's go with furniture.
[65:53.86]I need a chair in here.
[66:01.30]Yeah, this is like wooden.
[66:04.60]This is fucking...
[66:07.09]Wood chair.
[66:07.83]It's a little small, but it's fine.
[66:12.95]I need to have something else.
[66:23.64]Yeah, get a chair from like the 1400s.
[66:27.12]Just wood.
[66:27.34]Just hard, painful wood.
[66:38.90]Why do they still make chairs out of wood?
[66:41.14]Am I crazy for saying this?
[66:44.57]Everybody puts a pad on their chairs if they made it out of wood.
[66:47.59]Why even make them out of wood?
[66:49.37]Why not make them out of, like, silicone?
[66:52.05]And, like, have the legs be wood?
[66:53.95]Why do we have to sit on wood still?
[66:55.73]I don't understand.
[67:01.05]It's easy to make.
[67:05.82]It's cheap.
[67:06.72]Wood looks good.
[67:09.88]I guess.
[67:11.70]It sucks to sit on.
[67:12.94]Okay.
[67:15.54]How about... Or support, you dolt.
[67:19.18]I'm saying the wood... You can keep this... Yeah, but sitting on wood sucks.
[67:25.89]You don't want to sit in this for more than like 10 minutes.
[67:33.74]Is there a washing machine up here?
[67:38.00]And get cushions.
[67:38.88]Yeah, then why not just have like a cushioned thing that you actually sit on?
[67:42.23]Oh, here we go.
[67:46.07]This is perfect.
[67:47.33]Just a fucking plastic recycling bin.
[67:49.93]There's a million chairs like that.
[68:05.15]Yeah, I know there's options.
[68:09.18]But at the end of the day, like sitting on wood, it hurts.
[68:16.78]That's a poop bucket.
[68:19.56]Where's the plaster?
[68:33.67]You need a thicker butt.
[68:40.35]Fix the door.
[68:41.57]That can wait.
[68:42.03]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[68:50.12]That's it for plaster, right?
[68:52.72]Yep.
[68:53.94]Now, outlets.
[68:54.52]What's the point?
[68:58.14]I just want to take this door out.
[69:01.07]Because the door means you can go in there.
[69:05.15]Hmm.
[69:05.71]Well, that's more suspicious that way.
[69:08.93]Okay.
[69:09.25]So, I'm going to put...
[69:11.37]This is the garage leading to the door that leads to the real house.
[69:14.55]Let's figure out what we're going to do here.
[69:17.29]This is bedroom one.
[69:18.87]Let's go with decorations.
[69:21.77]Or... What about equipment?
[69:27.68]No toilet paper.
[69:28.42]No.
[69:28.72]No reason.
[69:31.82]Hmm.
[69:33.14]Accessories.
[69:35.88]This is stealable.
[69:36.56]I don't want it in here.
[69:38.84]Just spoons?
[69:39.16]Spoons?
[69:41.57]No one's gonna steal utensils.
[69:47.15]Put a tent in here?
[69:48.13]No.
[69:53.33]Put a tent in the house.
[69:56.01]Hold on.
[69:58.97]A jar?
[69:59.49]Bowl of mana.
[70:03.38]Okay, this is fake fruit.
[70:05.80]Perfect.
[70:06.80]That's perfect for our kitchen.
[70:14.09]Where's that going to be?
[70:14.77]Right here, right?
[70:15.73]Yeah.
[70:18.93]What happened to the mirror maze?
[70:20.27]I had like a mental breakdown playing the mirror house yesterday.
[70:24.22]It had a lot to do with Luigi's Mansion music just got wicked fucked up.
[70:29.28]It was messing with me.
[70:30.20]I had to stop.
[70:30.88]I had to get out.
[70:31.38]Okay.
[70:37.12]Anything else I want in here?
[70:39.81]That's in this room particularly.
[70:41.45]Okay.
[70:43.68]These are gonna be in every room.
[70:46.90]Decorations, maybe.
[70:51.37]Plants?
[70:52.21]No.
[70:53.89]Nah.
[70:55.75]Nah.
[70:58.61]Nah.
[71:00.43]Other.
[71:02.66]Ikea?
[71:05.14]Firewood in here?
[71:11.42]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[71:19.36]It's this firewood down here.
[71:20.73]There's nothing down here.
[71:39.84]This is like firewood.
[71:41.12]There's nothing in here.
[71:41.98]I do a different variety though.
[71:48.76]I don't want to look like Minecraft.
[71:57.87]Put a gas stove on the front lawn to scare off the thieves.
[72:05.49]Um, no.
[72:06.29]A gas stove on the front lawn means I'll probably be on an episode of Hoarders in a few weeks.
[72:12.53]That's what that means.
[72:13.11]Alright, let's do the other variant.
[72:37.50]There's got to be enough space that I can walk through here, though.
[72:39.82]Okay, there's plenty.
[72:40.70]There's plenty of space.
[72:45.79]Well, then upstairs has to be a shitty wood stove.
[72:53.25]This is a lot of firewood.
[73:01.04]Put on new music?
[73:02.88]Okay, somebody recommend something that's not Luigi's Mansion.
[73:10.56]Not really.
[73:13.52]Is this not a lot of wood?
[73:17.08]I guess maybe not.
[73:17.92]Okay.
[73:18.84]Those of you that have used... I've never used a wood-burning stove or anything.
[73:22.88]How much... How long would you be able to heat your house with this much wood?
[73:35.25]Not very long.
[73:37.27]Maybe a couple of hours, a few hours, hour, a couple hours.
[73:39.87]Damn, really?
[73:40.55]Holy shit.
[73:56.36]That doesn't seem like very long at all.
[74:10.78]Two days.
[74:11.40]Wait, are you kidding?
[74:13.84]Who said what?
[74:17.85]It's not supposed to be symmetrical.
[74:21.27]It would look weird if it was symmetrical.
[74:22.61]This is stacked wood.
[74:31.22]It would be two to three days.
[74:32.20]Okay, so I was just taking a picture.
[74:40.70]Okay.
[74:45.22]No, I don't want the camera.
[74:48.20]I want variant one.
[74:49.14]Post to your Instagram.
[74:51.99]Alright.
[74:54.41]One more layer.
[74:55.15]Just like a little bit kind of tethered down a little.
[74:59.41]Layered a little.
[75:00.07]You know what I'm saying?
[75:11.48]This is probably the most thought I've put into the whole house.
[75:22.78]Okay, good.
[75:23.36]That looks good.
[75:25.74]That's like if you got firewood down here.
[75:27.47]Should I put the wood stove down here?
[75:30.23]Would that make sense?
[75:30.97]Or does it have to be on the same layer?
[75:32.13]Alright, don't open that door.
[75:40.81]I slammed a water before I started playing.
[75:44.87]So that water is on its way out.
[75:47.05]So I got to be right back.
[78:22.79]Come on, guys.
[78:23.37]We can convince him to play 100 Gex.
[78:24.79]Just keep spamming 100 Gex or Riot.
[78:28.47]Well, now I know what I'm not going to play.
[78:30.81]Ever.
[78:42.27]Welcome back to the stream, everybody.
[78:44.78]It's me, Jabba.85.

[78:56.45]Everyone riot.
[78:57.31]Everyone riot.
[78:59.57]If you could do me a favor and stop rioting, that would be awesome.
[79:02.47]I would be so good on radio.
[79:03.57]You all know it.
[79:08.73]If streaming ever doesn't work out, I'm just going to go to the radio station.
[79:13.40]I'm just going to be like, can I have an interview?
[79:19.04]Sure.
[79:19.34]Do you apply through our website portal?
[79:21.90]No.
[79:22.06]No.
[79:24.32]Okay, I guess we have a position open.
[79:26.02]Come sit down.
[79:27.14]Okay, I will.
[79:29.24]So can you tell me about yourself a little?
[79:30.98]Of course I can.
[79:32.28]I grew up in Massachusetts in a small town called Boston.
[79:37.29]Okay.
[79:38.73]What are you interested in?
[79:40.33]Well, I'll tell you.
[79:41.63]I love talking.
[79:42.65]I love talking to people.
[79:44.11]I'm a people person.
[79:45.95]You need somebody to read the news?
[79:47.64]I'm that guy.
[79:49.20]I also like video games.
[79:50.80]I grew up on them my entire life.
[79:57.43]Okay, can you, this is just us in the room here together.
[80:02.29]I can't turn it off, let me do my thing.
[80:07.85]Okay.
[80:11.39]Change the channel.
[80:15.51]Make, please, please make a booger house.
[80:20.26]I'm gonna have to respectfully decline.
[80:22.58]And by the way, if you're gonna take 95, I would avoid it.
[80:29.98]Just keep that.
[80:33.58]You know how awesome that would be?
[80:35.26]Just reading where the traffic is.
[80:38.29]I would be so good at that.
[80:41.35]You're going to have to find a way around through the rotary on 2nd Street.
[80:45.09]And by the way, if you be careful, there is a crash and an accident on I-95.
[80:48.59]I would kill it.
[80:58.94]And I would just throw shit in there that, like, somebody would hear.
[81:05.18]Make sure you take the rotary.
[81:06.82]Oh, wow.
[81:07.36]Oh, wow.
[81:07.96]Wait.
[81:08.50]I'm fired.
[81:09.42]I got fired.
[81:11.18]The door rips open.
[81:12.28]You fucked up a word.
[81:13.26]You're fired.
[81:15.68]Hold on.
[81:15.88]Let me do it again.
[81:18.07]Just take the rotary on 2nd Street.
[81:21.53]Come on, Gwen.
[81:23.09]Coming up next, we have the news by Jake Stevenson.
[81:25.47]He's coming up here.
[81:27.75]And one of you guys would be like, what?
[81:28.79]Hold the fuck on.
[81:29.75]What did he just?
[81:30.19]Who's that?
[81:35.73]Alright, stop walking in circles and play.
[81:37.27]I've stopped this.
[81:39.55]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[81:43.70]Don't do, don't say toy boat.
[81:47.98]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[81:51.64]Oh, yeah, I still can do it.
[81:53.14]I could fucking read the weather if you gave me a script.
[81:55.28]I'll do it.
[82:00.01]What's happening?
[82:00.47]Okay, let's go.
[82:02.55]I need the second room.
[82:03.60]This room is done.
[82:05.38]Sick.
[82:08.50]Here's kitchen.
[82:16.41]All wood.
[82:17.99]A wooden sink.
[82:18.95]This is just like construction house.
[82:29.96]I don't know what happened over there, but I'll fix it later.
[82:32.08]Fuck this.
[82:45.13]This should be made out of silicone.
[82:50.78]Everything should be made out of silicone.
[82:54.98]True.
[82:56.36]Okay.
[82:58.76]Cabinet.
[83:00.83]What do we got for cabinets?
[83:01.53]We got the wood... Yeah.
[83:09.46]Jesus.
[83:10.10]This... Okay, I know, like, wooden cabinets look good.
[83:13.93]But these don't.
[83:30.47]Yeah, those are really tall.
[83:31.43]Where are the long cabinets?
[83:39.80]Too tall for you?
[83:40.44]That's too tall for anybody.
[83:43.78]This is like... That's 11 feet tall.
[83:46.87]You would have trouble reaching that.
[83:47.95]Let's do a tiered system.
[84:00.61]Oh shit, alright, nice.
[84:01.95]And then we have like a painting up there, nice.
[84:09.53]Too high, too low, too high, too low.
[84:11.66]Okay.
[84:20.70]I need kitchen, okay.
[84:22.82]Uh, door cabinet.
[84:24.56]Single door cabinet.
[84:27.23]Where's the wooden corner cabinet?
[84:31.26]Wooden corner left, wooden double door.
[84:33.28]Here we go.
[84:53.77]Why does this look crooked?
[84:54.69]Is the wall crooked?
[85:08.09]Oh, no.
[85:08.75]Right.
[85:09.31]Shit.
[85:09.59]I can't do that.
[85:18.01]Riot.
[85:20.68]What's the riot for?
[85:21.30]What are you talking about?
[85:28.90]I hate the way that looks.
[85:30.22]If I get rid of this, what's over there?
[85:31.58]I fucking hate how that looks.
[85:35.26]I don't like that little thing sticking out.
[85:37.04]It's pissing me off
[85:44.33]Turn off slow mode.
[85:45.39]Why would I turn off slow mode?
[85:46.41]There's like almost 7,000 people here.
[85:53.78]Turn off slow mode.
[86:02.34]I hate this.
[86:03.02]I know I've done this like three times already, but I don't like how this looks.
[86:20.39]Turn on fast mode.
[86:23.87]That's just no restrictions.
[86:30.56]Look.
[86:31.76]I have the solution.
[86:32.82]The solution is here.
[86:33.74]There we go.
[86:35.36]And then this wall just needs to be built this way.
[86:44.17]Why?
[86:57.96]That good?
[86:59.83]Yes.
[87:04.47]This legit looks like a lot of fun.
[87:07.01]Yeah, it is.
[87:08.89]We said this yesterday.
[87:10.33]We talked about it yesterday.
[87:11.37]This is like one of my favorite games.
[87:15.06]It's just... It just exists in its own fun world.
[87:20.90]I wish there was a little bit more freedom.
[87:24.90]I wish there was more freedom.
[87:27.46]if I could like delete stuff on the outside if I could if you could make the actual house house if I if I want to take down this wall and remove these windows if I want to get rid of a staircase and put a staircase in you're talking about now you're now you're at a 10. that's how you get to a 10.
[87:49.18]Just play The Sims?
[87:50.20]It's not the same.
[87:51.32]It's not the same.
[87:51.70]This is first-person, like, home decoration.
[87:54.26]It's not like in a cartoon universe.
[87:56.57]This is realistic graphics, realistic game.
[88:00.09]It's not cartoon sim world.
[88:01.61]It's on Minecraft.
[88:07.51]Minecraft is not... No, it's... What are you talking about?
[88:12.59]I would be careful here.
[88:14.04]Fred Lightly here, guys.
[88:15.32]You're talking shit about potentially my favorite game ever.
[88:23.22]I would choose your words more carefully.
[88:31.75]How's that?
[88:32.53]That's better.
[88:32.93]Paint.
[88:45.01]Super blue?
[88:46.45]No, not super blue.
[88:47.40]That's super frog.
[88:48.78]Sleepy blue.
[89:00.63]I'm punching.
[89:01.47]Unfair.
[89:02.01]Mr. Albus, I didn't see it.
[89:06.92]There, that's so much better.
[89:08.28]Now it doesn't look disgusting from this side.
[89:15.75]No, it doesn't look disgusting.
[89:24.79]Why do I keep doing this?
[89:25.93]It doesn't work every time.
[89:27.57]Why do I keep doing this?
[89:29.53]Why do I do that?
[89:30.76]It doesn't work every single time.
[89:38.40]But now this is just like a wall here.
[89:40.34]This has to move.
[89:41.00]This has got to move down.
[89:55.08]That sink's got to be in the right spot, though.
[89:56.69]I don't like the sink over there.
[90:08.96]Oh, yeah.
[90:11.50]Move Sleepy Blue in.
[90:12.56]I don't know what that is.
[90:16.04]I'm writing that.
[90:27.67]Okay.
[90:28.80]This has to move.
[90:30.32]Even- I need- I need this to be right there.
[90:32.36]Fake Spongebob fan.
[90:39.70]Sorry, I can't recal- Guys.
[90:42.03]I cannot recall every piece of media I have ever seen.
[90:52.07]This has gotta come in, but I made it like this so this could fit.
[90:58.28]Alright, moving.
[90:58.98]Okay.
[90:59.76]I'm taking the advice that that guy said like an hour and a half ago.
[91:03.70]Move wall.
[91:04.70]No, move door.
[91:17.63]Move the window.
[91:18.31]I can't move the windows.
[91:19.17]They're locked in place.
[91:20.77]You make me able to move windows and move staircases and take out exterior walls?
[91:24.41]The game's a ten.
[91:36.46]Okay.
[91:37.08]I need... I need this.
[91:41.22]Okay.
[91:41.84]Front door.
[91:42.62]No.
[91:43.36]Not a front door.
[91:43.96]We need a... Here.
[91:47.91]Internal white... Just internal white door.
[91:55.51]Perfect.
[91:56.59]There we go.
[91:57.23]Okay.
[91:58.59]Excellent.
[92:01.16]Excellent.
[92:04.06]How has it been an hour and a half and he's done nothing?
[92:05.88]Welcome to the game.
[92:07.62]That's kind of the whole game.
[92:08.52]The whole game is just kind of do nothing for four to ten hours.
[92:14.57]And then sometimes look back and go, oh yeah, that paint looks nice.
[92:22.09]That's better.
[92:22.57]Alright, now I can move this forward a little and then this wall can... Home designing is hard.
[92:38.16]Oh, music.
[92:38.84]Right, right.
[92:39.82]Listen to your viewers.
[92:46.95]Better.
[92:47.37]Okay.
[92:55.51]This comes forward.
[92:57.29]Like this.
[93:00.83]Alright.
[93:01.62]This wall then comes in.
[93:08.56]What happens if I break this?
[93:12.00]It's okay.
[93:14.18]I pick it up later.
[93:31.85]Somebody scratches all over these.
[93:37.69]Why does it look like you ran over my cabinets with a car?
[93:44.16]Well, they fell.
[93:46.26]One of them fell in the truck.
[93:47.42]It must have been a truck problem.
[93:56.58]I didn't do anything.
[93:59.76]I wonder how much shit actually happens with construction that you just never know.
[94:06.42]You know in the beginning of Ace Ventura, when Jim Carrey is literally just dropkicking that guy's package all over the whole fucking entire apartment complex?
[94:16.43]How many times does that happen?
[94:18.45]How many times do they just blow a wall out with a hammer for fun?
[94:21.94]And like destroy somebody's cabinets and then go, oh, shit, we gotta patch that back up.
[94:26.46]But it happens quite frequently.
[94:27.42]Okay.
[94:42.38]Alright, is that better?
[94:43.00]Did I fix it finally?
[94:45.16]Because then this goes... Did I not do anything?
[94:52.39]No, no, I got it, I got it.
[94:53.19]I have to do this one.
[95:04.39]And then I can still make it in here.
[95:05.95]Good.
[95:09.70]This has to move a little bit.
[95:20.10]Remove the walls.
[95:20.86]No, I can't.
[95:21.64]Every single house I've ever made in this game has been just an open floor plan.
[95:28.35]Open floor plan is just translated into I don't actually know what I should do.
[95:34.88]So just remove all of it.
[95:46.76]Splatoon 2 OST, for fuck's sake.
[95:49.32]Oh my god.
[95:50.10]Oh my goodness.
[95:57.07]Splatoon 2 OST.
[96:13.88]Oh, actually, this is kind of cool.
[96:14.72]I like when they go...
[96:18.75]If I had practice in the bathtub, I would get it.
[96:35.98]Is there a song in this that's like... I think there is, right?
[96:40.48]Where it goes... What does it do?
[96:43.14]It's this one.
[96:44.89]It's the one I'm thinking of.
[96:51.92]I was gonna say there's one of the lyrics.
[96:58.69]Am I making progress?
[96:59.75]I feel like I'm just Indiana Jones-ing this room.
[97:02.22]I'm just like squishing it.
[97:03.32]I'm slowly moving the walls in.
[97:04.84]Is this doing anything?
[97:05.64]Is this gonna fix my problem?
[97:13.49]Oh, yeah, this is the... I love this song.
[97:21.57]I want this played at my fucking funeral.
[97:40.54]Uh, there's... Excuse me.
[97:42.24]There is no... I'm about to skip this one.
[97:45.04]Is this even a good soundtrack?
[97:59.01]It doesn't have that song.
[98:01.51]That's a different track.
[98:02.71]It better be on here or I'm skipping it.
[98:13.03]That's fine.
[98:13.43]Looks good.
[98:23.48]This looks like I just moved in.
[98:24.66]Throw my boxes.
[98:26.08]Alright, put this shit back.
[98:28.02]I need to paint it.
[98:28.82]What color is the kitchen gonna be?
[98:40.79]Copper coin.
[98:42.11]Light cream.
[98:44.65]Mustard yellow.
[98:47.07]Sunny D orange.
[98:49.15]Now that's Sunny D orange.
[98:57.75]Sunny D. The orange juice enema.
[99:23.67]Why'd you say that?
[99:28.91]Oh, fuck.
[99:29.41]Usually I can blame this on somebody.
[99:33.70]In a typical fashion, I can just blame someone in the chat for that.
[99:40.14]None of you said that, though.
[99:41.46]I did.
[99:41.72]Hmm.
[99:44.82]Never been in this position before.
[99:46.61]That has never happened.
[99:50.01]Oh, no.
[99:50.81]Um...
[99:52.88]sorry about that one yeah I guess put it down what are you doing put this down these are in such stupid places
[100:23.68]I hate it already.
[100:24.36]What are they saying?
[100:40.99]This music is bad.
[100:48.81]At least somebody is going to take the rock throwing away from my house for a change.
[100:54.31]I didn't say that.
[101:05.16]Is this 100 gex?
[101:07.14]Sure.
[101:08.74]Maybe.
[101:12.64]Platoon music sounds good for about 3 minutes.
[101:20.06]I don't know.
[101:20.46]Does it?
[101:21.96]Does this be flush?
[101:25.30]What do you guys think?
[101:25.86]Flush?
[101:35.08]Oh, but no.
[101:36.04]How am I going to wash my hands and look at the kids outside?
[101:39.22]No, I hate it.
[101:41.48]Change it.
[101:45.53]There.
[101:46.13]Now I can see my children playing.
[101:59.63]I don't even know what.
[102:01.71]I don't even know what.
[102:02.43]Like, you're sitting here, you're like the dad or the mom or whatever, and you can just watch the kids playing outside, and you can just watch them from doing the dishes or something.
[102:14.60]Kitchen island, yeah.
[102:15.40]That looks nice.
[102:25.43]Alright, I'm going to leave everything open.
[102:27.51]So whoever is trying to rob this place sees that there's literally nothing in this whole house.
[102:33.88]Right?
[102:34.14]If you come in here... Oh, I'm going to steal.
[102:35.44]Let's get in there.
[102:44.46]Oh.
[102:45.96]Nothing?
[102:46.38]Fruit?

[103:28.71]Outer Wilds?
[103:29.51]Now that's a good one.
[103:30.49]I can get behind that one.
[103:40.87]Outer Wilds OST.
[103:41.85]Hey, remember when I gave Outer Wilds an 8.9 and you guys wanted to dip me in acid?
[103:49.18]I remember that.
[104:01.78]Oh yeah, this music is so good.
[104:09.62]I'm sorry, but an 8.9 is an incredible score.
[104:17.56]8.9, that's fantastic.
[104:19.39]That's a very, very good score.
[104:27.61]Anything below a 9.5 is unacceptable.
[104:32.39]No, I think anything below an 8.5 would be unacceptable.
[104:42.01]Should I put this toilet paper?
[104:44.63]Should I really?
[104:45.05]Should this be like a prank?
[104:46.37]Should there be a shitload of toilet paper just in every cabinet?
[104:51.91]Or in one of the cabinets?
[104:52.95]Okay, in one cabinet over here, it's going to be full of toilet paper.
[105:01.84]He hated the game.
[105:02.82]No, it was a fucking great game.
[105:04.00]You know what?
[105:04.34]Fine.
[105:04.56]I'll give it a 9.
[105:05.02]It's a 9.0.
[105:06.32]I was going to give it a 9.0.
[105:09.59]Fine.
[105:10.87]It's a 9.0.
[105:11.45]No, it's not.
[105:16.57]It's an 8.9.
[105:19.92]Music's too low.
[105:20.64]What's that?
[105:27.98]Soundtrack sounds like an 8.9.
[105:30.16]What's that mean?
[105:30.74]Alright, here we go.
[105:32.80]I want to do... I need kitchen shit.
[105:40.71]Here we go.
[105:40.93]This wooden cabinet with an oven.

[107:15.50]So did somebody ask why does this house look so cheap?
[107:20.60]Stick around for like another hour or two.
[107:22.54]Wrong paint.
[107:27.68]Skin.
[107:29.84]Flash your walls.
[107:32.76]No, sorry.
[107:33.66]It's copper coin.
[107:35.00]How does that look bad?
[107:53.08]Sorry, just getting a little sip.
[107:56.52]Meat walls.
[108:07.82]Damn, it's really been almost two hours.
[108:10.02]How does this keep happening to me?
[108:18.41]That is not this room anymore.
[108:23.66]Get out.
[108:24.82]There we are.
[108:27.22]This is alert.
[108:29.01]Alert, alert, alert.
[108:30.15]This shouldn't be here.
[108:35.55]This is messed up.
[108:36.39]Okay, what's the ground gonna be?
[108:40.69]We need some kind of tile in the... Nobody has a carpeted kitchen.
[108:45.45]Floor.
[108:46.29]It's either tile or wood or... Floor.
[108:51.69]Something like this.
[108:53.51]Something easy.
[108:54.35]Something a little gray.
[108:57.77]No, no gray.
[108:58.96]Although I like that.
[108:59.66]I like the way this looks.
[109:02.68]What arcade carpet everywhere?
[109:08.24]Whatever it is, it's got to be cheap.
[109:14.89]I mean, is this the dead giveaway that this is not a real kitchen?
[109:18.29]That there's arcade carpet everywhere?
[109:33.03]That's so ugly It's too it's so ugly I can't even have it here as the funny thing I go haha it's the arcade rug no It's so bad And I don't do I am I am I like a dick okay, I don't want to be like a dick but If you go and you're gonna get a carpet installed somewhere I
[110:02.21]What makes you point at this one?
[110:04.45]And go, that's the one.
[110:06.80]Love it.
[110:09.78]How do you... How did this... It just hurts.
[110:23.02]You know, maybe... Okay, if they took out... If they took out the yellow... Okay, maybe.
[110:27.98]But it's like a look at a magic eye painting.
[110:34.84]Like I'm going to go like this.
[110:35.74]I'm going to like cross my eyes and like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is going to be there.
[110:50.21]You know, a lot of people can't do those and I couldn't do it for a really long time.
[110:54.81]If you cannot do a magic eye, I'm going to give you the secret.
[110:59.75]When you look at a magic eye, you're sitting and you go, I can't make it work, I can't make it work.
[111:04.57]I just cross my eyes while I look at it.
[111:08.02]And when I cross my eyes and look at it, eventually the picture just goes, oh, here it is.
[111:11.86]Okay, what's it going to be over here?
[111:20.22]This is the garage.
[111:20.88]The garage is going to be a garage.
[111:25.01]It's not a secret.
[111:25.71]That's how it works.
[111:29.69]Wait, are you supposed to cross your eyes?
[111:33.82]That's the point.
[111:34.52]Yeah, but... I thought it was... But not all people can just cross their eyes straight together.
[111:44.38]You know, it's actually hard for people to cross their eyes.
[111:46.03]Like, they can't do it.
[111:49.03]So yeah, it's not a secret.
[111:50.69]I thought it was a secret for the longest time when I was younger.
[111:54.56]Okay, I thought it was a secret when I was like 10.
[111:56.74]And this topic has never been brought up before.
[112:02.06]Until today.
[112:04.48]I don't think I've heard, I haven't thought about magic eyes since I was 10.
[112:09.30]And like maybe like the two or three other times I've referenced it before maybe.
[112:15.17]But I never talked about my secret.
[112:16.71]So my secret, that was knowledge, that was 10 year old knowledge.
[112:20.31]I have not thought about that secret in 25 years.
[112:33.83]Why am I still crouching?
[112:47.83]I'm begging you, start making sense when you talk.
[112:52.69]Sure.
[112:54.88]Time that person out for 10 minutes.
[112:56.52]Is that clear?
[113:00.94]Did that make sense?
[113:11.10]Tyrant.
[113:11.56]Tyrant.
[113:12.14]Evil.
[113:14.04]Evil.
[113:14.38]I don't actually mean any of this shit.
[113:17.68]There might be a lot of new viewers here.
[113:19.58]95% of the things I say are not even true.
[113:23.32]We only have a 5% truth policy on this channel.
[113:29.53]Perfect.
[113:30.13]Oh, yeah.
[113:30.53]Wait, was this an actual toxic waste barrel?
[113:36.99]How did I just get to that?
[113:42.66]Wait, it's an app.
[113:53.95]It's supposed to be yellow, right?
[114:03.93]And then I don't go down there.
[114:04.89]This is a radioactive stuff is.
[114:20.36]Make them red explosive barrels.
[114:22.34]I can't.
[114:25.48]I want to make them yellow.
[114:30.39]Can I?
[114:30.71]Wait, I can make red explosive barrels.
[114:34.47]Yeah, alright, so don't fuck around down here.
[114:40.41]Yeah, you turn this corner, and this is anybody.
[114:43.34]It doesn't matter who you are.
[114:45.24]If you've ever played a single video game in your entire life, if you are in someone's house, and you walk down these stairs, and you see that, this is a video game set up with poison barrels and an explosive barrel.
[114:59.61]I'm not going down here.
[115:02.23]I'm gonna come back up the stairs, and I'm gonna say, you go first.
[115:06.86]Not gonna be me first.
[115:11.80]Like, okay, there is like four guys over here.
[115:16.63]And they're about to run at me with machine guns.
[115:18.95]And I'm supposed to shoot that barrel.
[115:22.23]Nope, I ain't going down.
[115:23.51]This is your house, man.
[115:30.13]Perfect deterrent.
[115:37.60]Alright, good.
[115:41.64]Just build an FPS house.
[115:43.82]No, don't.
[115:44.64]This idea can't change.
[115:47.06]No.
[115:48.73]I don't want to put, like, explosive barrels.
[115:53.17]Oh, make an FPS house.
[115:55.77]No, it's perfect.
[115:57.40]It's so funny.
[115:59.22]That was such a good idea.
[116:02.01]No, I can't make like a... I can't make the in the house, you're the shooter, FPS, you're in... I can't.
[116:09.78]Like, oh, you're gonna go in here.
[116:11.10]It's like PUBG.
[116:12.22]Explosive barrels of weapons.
[116:13.66]God damn it.
[116:19.61]I gotta finish this.
[116:20.43]I'm finishing this one.
[116:21.19]I have to finish this.
[116:22.77]I have to... I start... I can't just keep doing new houses.
[116:28.73]I can't.
[116:29.15]We started with mirror house, then it turned into cars.
[116:32.95]People are in cars, living in the cars in the house.
[116:36.13]And then that turns into a fake house.
[116:38.09]No, we're not turning this to FPS level.
[116:40.93]That's gonna have to be the next one.
[116:47.48]ADHD TV.
[116:48.98]No, we can't.
[116:50.30]I can't, I can't, I can't.
[116:51.22]Not right now.
[116:52.44]I have to finish my thing.
[117:01.28]FPS level up top.
[117:13.10]I have to make my dream out.
[117:16.06]It's so perfect though.
[117:17.62]It's so perfect.
[117:20.15]It's the perfect thing.
[117:21.17]Alright.
[117:24.19]I'm going to finish this idea.
[117:27.63]After the idea is over, it can be changed.
[117:32.49]Let me do my kitchen floor.
[117:35.99]Let me do my kitchen floor.
[117:38.47]Let me, here we are.
[117:42.17]If you just, you need to, when you do social distancing, don't stand near each other.
[117:48.04]Don't be stupid.
[117:49.90]And wear your fucking mask.
[117:53.89]There's no reason not to wear one.
[118:03.62]Hey, I think I can do a pretty good Fauci.
[118:11.20]You do know that when I unlock a new voice, you're going to hear it at least four or five times in a month.
[118:16.65]I'm sorry.
[118:17.29]That's the way it is here.
[118:18.57]If you can't handle that, I'm not sure what to tell you.
[118:25.23]I only get to unlock a new voice like every two or three years.
[118:28.03]You got to let me have it for a little while.
[118:41.64]Oh no!
[118:59.26]No, where is it?
[119:18.11]Does the screen go to black or does the screen go to white in that game?
[119:30.22]I couldn't figure it out.
[119:34.82]The stream just reverts to the beginning.
[119:36.34]Alright, no more distractions.
[119:40.02]Stop.
[119:40.24]Don't distract me anymore.
[119:41.16]I'm done.
[119:41.94]Here we go.
[119:42.60]Floor.
[119:44.04]Tiles.
[119:45.82]I'm like the most easily distractible person.
[119:52.18]How about this one?
[119:54.24]Floor panels.
[119:58.79]There.
[119:59.75]There we are.
[120:00.51]Okay, that looks so cozy.
[120:11.39]You built one room in three hours.
[120:13.98]It says, excuse me, first of all, you added 33% more time.
[120:19.72]You've added a third more time.
[120:20.88]It's only been two hours.
[120:22.64]And no, I did one room and then a room before that when we changed the new houses.
[120:31.75]Okay, good.
[120:32.43]There's my floor.
[120:33.53]Done.
[120:34.21]Next.
[120:34.63]What's up next?
[120:35.85]Next thing.
[120:36.19]There's the kitchen.
[120:37.03]We got the stove.
[120:38.19]The sink.
[120:40.09]Uh... A microwave.
[120:42.25]It's okay.
[120:42.81]It can just go over here.
[120:44.75]No, you can unplug that and walk out with it.
[120:48.04]Things that can't be walked... Fine.
[120:49.22]That's good.
[120:50.54]Alright, this has to be a hallway.
[121:02.66]And then you turn the corner, you peek, and here it is.
[121:05.66]FPS as I can't get over it.
[121:07.10]That's so stupid.
[121:10.34]There we are.
[121:10.85]Here's the kitchen.
[121:16.17]You open up.
[121:16.89]There you are.
[121:17.43]There's the bathroom.
[121:21.03]But it's not a bathroom.
[121:22.31]In fact, we can take this whole thing out.
[121:26.32]What's this here for?
[121:27.30]For nothing.
[121:29.44]Did I put looking expensive looking shit in the windows?
[121:34.79]in the on the windows right here in the front of the house just put really expensive looking clocks what's with why are you baiting burglars to come in um because I'm so I guess I'm so confident that they're never gonna find the real house
[122:04.74]I don't know.
[122:05.26]It's almost like I have a camera setup up here in every room.
[122:09.82]And I kind of just watch and try to find the real room.
[122:14.38]But then if they find it, I'm in a lot of trouble.
[122:29.75]It's a prank video house.
[122:42.12]This house is becoming a lot of different things.
[122:50.19]Yeah, the person's gonna come in here and they're gonna get chased around this house by a guy in a gorilla suit.
[122:58.44]No more monkeying around here.
[123:00.44]We'll see you when we come back next on Prankmasters.
[123:08.74]They're always so huddled down in front of the little screen they have.
[123:12.12]Oh, they're coming in!
[123:13.58]Like, why do you have one screen?
[123:16.88]How come you don't have it way bigger?
[123:18.08]Why is it like eight people hovering over and looking at somebody else's monitor?
[123:22.36]Why would we put it up on the fucking wall, dude?
[123:33.53]It's always this wicked cramped-ass room.
[123:37.27]Oh, they're in a broom closet.
[123:40.01]Why wouldn't you have a huge setup for that?
[123:43.87]Well, they're always in like a hotel room.
[123:49.70]I know that some of that is because they're in the hotel room next door.
[123:52.62]But that doesn't make any sense to me.
[123:55.60]Because if there's ten people all like laughing their ass off and talking in the hotel room next door.
[124:02.24]Wouldn't you hear that if you were in the adjacent room?
[124:07.76]Like, can you imagine, like, you hear, like, a ding-dong at your door?
[124:10.93]And you hear, like... Who is it?
[124:26.10]I'm the pizza delivery gorilla.
[124:29.56]Uh, I just heard that over there.
[124:32.06]Alright, I guess, come on in.
[124:37.76]Hey, uh, you're in a cool gorilla suit.
[124:39.94]Somebody, you know, is there... Are you... Thanks for the pizza, dude.
[124:44.30]I didn't order a pizza.
[124:51.08]Don't throw the pizza at him!
[124:52.84]Don't throw the fucking pizza at me, dude.
[124:54.30]Don't, like, ba-boom!
[124:55.36]Slam the door.
[124:59.80]How does that always work?
[125:03.64]Why did I take this down?
[125:08.16]Oh wait, this kind of makes sense.
[125:17.73]And it makes sense for one reason.
[125:20.41]Is that I want the entrance here.
[125:24.01]No, yeah I do.
[125:24.49]This is in the garage.
[125:25.37]That's a perfect entrance.
[125:27.53]I want it to be tiny though.
[125:30.14]And I actually... No, I can't build on that.
[125:34.72]Shit.
[125:37.28]Remember, this would be a 10 out of 10 game if you could get rid of staircases and rebuild them somewhere.
[125:42.83]We're talking 10.
[125:43.63]No, I can't do what I wanted to do, so it's okay.
[125:56.12]Put it back.
[126:04.38]Alright, we need to do Sandy Coin.
[126:09.06]Prank shows are ridiculous, though.
[126:14.97]I never, like, thought about being on a prank.
[126:18.71]Okay, here's the thing.
[126:19.63]How many times do you think you may have been on a prank show that was never aired?
[126:23.98]I think about that.
[126:29.46]Like, the joke didn't work on you, and they kind of just, like, leave.
[126:32.98]Leave.
[126:40.12]Like, how many times have I may have seen somebody in a gorilla suit, like, running around, like, screaming, and, like, she screams in my face or something, and I'm like, hey, what the fuck?
[126:48.06]It's not like a, oh, I didn't get him.
[126:50.10]Just delete that part.
[127:07.60]Those shows are fake, idiot.
[127:10.49]Um.
[127:10.59]Alright.
[127:25.31]We're not talking about, like, who won on The Bachelor.
[127:29.17]We're talking about, like, a prank video.
[127:33.97]No, I don't think that they're real.
[127:36.24]I'm just saying.
[127:36.94]Have I ever been on one?
[127:47.95]They're fake.
[127:50.93]You're on one right now.
[128:00.90]Stealable, stealable, stealable, stealable, stealable.
[128:05.62]Extravagant.
[128:06.38]No, that's not going up here.
[128:12.51]No, no lights either.
[128:13.57]Who cares?
[128:13.93]They'll have to bring a flashlight.
[128:19.39]Okay, that looks good.
[128:20.47]Somebody said no fridge.
[128:28.88]Japan refrigerator.
[128:30.02]No, that sounds expensive.
[128:36.84]No, why is this a wooden fridge?
[128:44.91]Okay, now it's a skin house.
[128:48.30]I agree with you.
[128:49.16]Now it's a horror movie human skin furniture in an appliance house.
[128:57.38]This would be scary.
[129:00.58]This would be terrifying.
[129:04.44]Without any context on this room, I'm leaving as soon as I get in here.
[129:12.43]The fruit there?
[129:13.09]Don't touch that fruit.
[129:15.31]Don't touch that.
[129:18.74]This is either fake and real.
[129:20.46]This is either fake with a trap on it, real and poisoned.
[129:24.78]Don't touch this.
[129:25.62]Cool.
[129:31.14]Alright, let's continue.
[129:37.86]Wooden.
[129:40.00]The Pinocchio house.
[129:41.10]Okay, let's go... I need... Doors and windows.
[129:48.31]Roman blinds?
[129:49.61]Wait, hold on.
[129:51.89]Can I just put a gigantic curtain here?
[129:55.99]Please.
[129:57.55]Please!
[129:58.07]No.
[130:02.01]I can't just put a big curtain.
[130:15.90]I guess I could just do a big door frame, right?
[130:26.77]And then hang the curtain on the doorframe.
[130:33.74]Can I do that?
[130:43.37]Can I put something in this doorway?
[130:44.81]Just block it with barrels.
[131:02.24]An outside hallway.
[131:05.96]No, okay.
[131:06.58]Alright, alright, alright.
[131:19.65]I guess what's the point of this?
[131:20.93]What's the point of the door frame?
[131:25.69]It doesn't matter.
[131:26.07]The doors are going to be open anyways.
[131:35.55]Slime raid?
[131:36.79]Yeah, yeah.
[131:41.26]Heard he's a good streamer.
[131:42.18]Whoever he is.
[131:44.64]You don't know his name.
[131:47.38]You don't know his name.
[131:50.18]I haven't told you yet.
[131:58.84]Where's the raid from?
[132:01.21]What's the channel's name?
[132:07.14]Okay, I want carpet.
[132:09.48]Or wood.
[132:11.86]Wood on the ground.
[132:19.98]No carpet.
[132:20.76]Carpet, carpet, carpet, carpet.
[132:25.49]How about... Somebody mentioned kitty litter before.
[132:30.93]There it is.
[132:41.10]Holding the kitty litter.
[132:55.11]This is an arcade carpet.
[132:56.45]Not quite.
[132:57.67]It's kind of.
[133:02.45]Let's do... Do I need any more wall down this way?
[133:05.61]Yeah.
[133:08.97]With a door.
[133:11.55]Or just like an opening.
[133:26.63]That's the garage.
[133:27.57]Right.
[133:27.87]Shit.
[133:28.15]Okay, hold on.
[133:41.02]Better get rid of this.
[133:46.76]Absolutely rancid house.
[133:52.84]School library.
[133:59.07]And we talked about wood earlier.
[134:01.01]This kind of carpet, if you lay down on it, would be like laying down on wood.
[134:09.39]There's nothing there.
[134:14.50]This is the same thickness as a sticker pack.
[134:21.91]It's just there so the cold concrete doesn't come through.
[134:24.75]What's going on up here?
[134:32.45]Cut that out, it pisses me off.
[134:33.83]Sorry guys, I fucking just get mad sometimes.
[134:39.77]This is annoying.
[134:48.65]Ream House is coming along really well, I think.
[134:55.68]Good.
[134:56.40]Look!
[134:57.88]Look.
[134:59.66]Look.
[135:10.56]Psycho is going off the deep end.
[135:15.21]Psycho.
[135:20.25]Why?
[135:20.53]You're a psycho.
[135:33.08]Flesh kitchen.
[135:33.84]Two left doors.
[135:34.60]Explosive nuclear.
[135:36.32]What?
[135:38.10]Flesh kitchen.
[135:39.76]Two left doors.
[135:40.52]Explosive nuclear barrels in the basement.
[135:42.62]Looks like a good house.
[135:44.48]Well, you don't know about those barrels yet until you decide to come fucking rob me.
[135:53.59]This is that concept.
[135:57.35]So what is this incoming concept?
[136:12.54]No, no, I'm not talking about the theme.
[136:14.60]Alright, let's do this quick.
[136:23.68]I'll leave that for now.
[136:26.79]This is the living area.
[136:27.89]Remember I said TV goes right here.
[136:32.23]I've removed the exact spot where the TV was supposed to go.
[136:40.35]It's okay.
[136:40.72]The TV can be right here.
[136:43.52]Yeah, that's fine.
[136:47.04]Can I please hang one of those CRT TVs?
[136:50.88]Can I hang this?
[136:52.08]Please tell me I can hang this.
[136:55.32]I know how to do this.
[136:57.20]I'm going to put a shelf and then put it on the shelf.
[137:21.73]Okay, good.
[137:24.10]Remember, this is supposed to be a fake IKEA house, and these are made out of plastic.
[137:34.45]It's not gonna fall.
[137:35.53]It's got lots of back weight.
[137:40.55]Another DVD player?
[137:41.67]Hold on, I need some furniture.
[137:50.29]It's stapled.
[137:55.05]They always have this really, really basic, shitty little sofa, too.
[138:04.54]I'm convinced that those, like, Ikea showroom sofas, they're not actually purchasable.
[138:09.58]I know they have a tag on it, but I feel like they don't actually for sale.
[138:14.91]Uh...
[138:20.12]They are.
[138:20.58]I know, but it just... I don't know.
[138:22.52]I feel like that it wouldn't even... He hates Ikea.
[138:25.10]I actually like Ikea.
[138:27.54]I like eating at Ikea.
[138:48.15]Ikea food's alright.
[138:49.01]Oh, yeah, it's awesome.
[138:51.67]You gotta get that, the meatballs, man.
[138:53.03]The meatballs are awesome.
[139:16.94]Meatballs, gravy, and fries.
[139:18.02]They actually do, the salmon's there's pretty good.
[139:21.00]Do they still do a salmon?
[139:29.61]He hates bits.
[139:30.39]Oh shit, did I miss one?
[139:37.68]Hold on, I'm doing like a toilet paper like seance.
[139:49.24]Okay.
[139:49.87]Big bits.
[139:50.81]Let's see.
[139:51.19]It's huge, actually.
[139:56.29]Fucking hundred dollars.
[139:59.19]That's ten thousand bits.
[140:05.60]That's an insane amount of money.
[140:08.78]Especially considering that people know now that I don't read messages anymore.
[140:15.21]I cannot believe there are people that are still willing to throw that kind of money at me.
[140:23.62]That's insane.
[140:25.44]I can't believe you would pay me that much money.
[140:30.30]This is my dream house?
[140:31.82]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[140:33.36]That was from Slow... Sorry, let me say that correctly.
[140:36.82]That was from S10WUpdate.
[140:41.22]Thank you for the hundred fucking bucks.
[140:45.92]I've been saving this.
[140:47.18]I'm grateful for the years I spent watching content.
[140:50.22]I want you to keep that money.
[140:56.01]Okay, if you have an opportunity to put $100 into my bank account or $100 into your savings account, pick the savings account.
[141:07.73]Every time.
[141:12.91]Oh, shit.
[141:13.23]There's a second room.
[141:14.29]This is both of the bathrooms down here.
[141:15.57]Right, right, right, right.
[141:23.12]I would much rather you come to me, like,
[141:27.23]four or five months from now.
[141:30.17]And be like, oh yeah, I saved a bunch of money.
[141:33.31]And be like, wait, wait, where's my cut?
[141:35.53]You didn't give any to me.
[141:36.45]I want something else in here.
[141:45.86]But $100 is a lot of money.
[141:49.06]There's a lot of people that have given a shitload.
[141:53.80]I appreciate the fact that you're willing to do that.
[141:57.14]But I hope that you're taking care of yourself first.
[142:05.21]Thank you, S10WUpdate.
[142:08.87]The $100, it's a lot of money.
[142:10.25]I hope I use it well.
[142:14.87]And they say play BioShock 2.
[142:16.05]Gotta play BioShock 1 first.
[142:20.93]On the list.
[142:30.67]Oh my god, play that now.
[142:33.98]What is going on here?
[142:34.84]What's this?
[142:41.42]Okay, I gotta figure out what I want to do with these rooms.
[142:43.90]I did my toilet paper, like, got ya, like, dream- Oh yeah, somebody said this is your dream house.
[142:48.25]It is, but not yet.
[142:49.03]Need a wallpaper.
[142:59.64]I wish I could just do toilet paper on the walls.
[143:31.81]Why?
[143:32.09]I want to see what it looks like.
[143:43.46]No, no.
[143:44.62]It can't be that egregious.
[143:46.22]You know what I mean?
[143:46.74]I have to at least put a little tongue in cheek here.
[143:52.69]We're going to go with something just decent.
[144:00.68]It's kind of a living room wallpaper.
[144:03.68]This one here.
[144:04.16]This is scary music.
[144:22.04]Turn it off.
[144:29.65]I can't get over the prank house.
[144:32.99]This really is... This is not even a prank house.
[144:35.98]This is a really shitty prank house.
[144:40.44]Oh, come in in here.
[144:41.22]Oh, this one.
[144:42.06]Oh, what?
[144:42.44]Oh, this is like... What?
[144:43.60]What the heck?
[144:44.36]That's weird.
[144:45.10]That's kind of an odd thing.
[144:47.47]Toilet paper.
[144:48.53]Ha ha ha.
[144:49.35]In place... In the place of... Of, uh... Stuff.
[144:54.07]I'm on TV.
[144:56.83]I'm on TV.
[144:57.85]Where is it?
[145:08.02]This is definitely, yeah, this is an I'm on TV house.
[145:29.77]So obvious.
[145:40.25]I gotta change this music.
[145:41.01]This music is putting me to sleep.
[145:43.52]I've mellowed the fuck out so hard since that music's been on.
[145:48.84]It's just making me chilled out.
[145:53.87]I gotta change the music.
[146:05.00]Mario Kart?
[146:05.92]Nice.
[146:06.96]That'll do it.
[146:09.31]Mario Kart?
[146:12.63]Um, I typed DLC.
[146:15.13]OST.
[146:23.39]That's much better.
[146:40.56]That's that room.
[146:41.66]That's that.
[146:42.30]We're gonna make a... This is gonna stay open.
[146:48.10]That's the concept I'm going for.
[146:51.46]Very good.
[146:53.50]Louder.
[146:57.38]I've increased it by 100%.
[146:58.42]Alright, let's go down here.
[147:03.36]Looks pretty good.
[147:04.44]Garage door.
[147:05.65]Gotta fix that little gap.
[147:17.27]I wish I could paint the ceiling.
[147:21.47]Why do I need my couch?
[147:22.85]Louder.
[147:23.09]No, I don't want to be louder.
[147:24.65]It's loud enough.
[147:25.31]Louder.
[147:25.63]100% louder.
[147:25.89]Fine.
[147:26.05]I'm looking for a couch.
[147:47.88]There it is.
[147:49.00]It's expensive, but that's the one I'm talking about.
[147:50.72]This is one of those weird sofas that the back is too short and your feet don't touch the ground somehow.
[148:05.21]I'm on it.
[148:16.19]Because you're short.
[148:16.91]No, it's because the cushion's too high.
[148:22.44]There we go.
[148:23.54]It's leather, though.
[148:24.20]Too expensive.
[148:24.74]It's a nice coffin bed.
[148:35.39]Why would I want to lie in... I don't want to lie on this panini press.
[148:38.39]This is going to squish me and grill me.
[148:40.15]I don't want this.
[148:51.87]This sucks so much that I feel like it should be in this house.
[149:06.56]Oh no, I just made myself so hungry.
[149:09.18]It's like a fresh s'more that hasn't been squished yet, and they're gonna put the chocolate in it and squish it.
[149:16.20]God damn it.
[149:17.92]I can't look at that anymore.
[149:18.70]I can't look at that.
[149:19.12]It looks like a delicious ice cream cake.
[149:27.48]I have to get rid- I- I might have to get rid of that.
[149:29.98]It's too delicious looking.
[149:31.34]Get it out of my house.
[149:34.62]I'm gonna go here and... Um... The guard's still down there.
[149:39.50]Let's go over here.
[149:43.24]So, wouldn't think- yep.
[149:44.15]It's- yeah.
[149:45.15]I feel wicked fucking wicked nervous now.
[149:47.41]What's going on?
[149:47.85]Um, I think I'm gonna... I gotta put in the air conditioner.
[149:53.99]What's wrong?
[149:56.53]Did I put more fruit?
[149:57.31]Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.
[150:25.72]Now something's really wrong.
[150:32.11]Whoa, weird house, man.
[150:35.81]What is this crazy looking thing?
[150:39.67]Not a real clock, not a real clock, not a real clock.
[150:41.29]It's a child's clock.
[150:42.19]I'm going to die.
[150:42.65]I'm dead.
[150:43.15]I'm already dead.
[150:43.75]I've already died because I booked up here.
[150:44.99]I'm dead.
[150:52.81]Faster.
[150:53.39]No, slower.
[150:56.47]Alright, I'm going to do... What color is the actual display going to be?
[151:04.74]White?
[151:05.90]No, not red.
[151:06.92]Green?
[151:07.24]I mean, what's wrong with the clock?
[151:10.52]The clock is backwards?
[151:29.36]What?
[151:33.60]No, it's not.
[151:36.12]Is it?
[151:38.32]1, 12, 1, 2, it's backwards.
[151:42.90]It is backwards.
[151:49.77]That makes it even worse.
[151:54.93]I don't like this.
[151:55.83]Why do I have to keep playing the music?
[151:56.99]That makes me freaking anxious.
[152:00.24]I know it's the OST, but do you have to have the full soundtrack when there's 10 seconds left in the game?
[152:05.36]I just want to hear the songs.
[152:07.34]I don't want to hear the sped up, scary, you're going to lose song right after it.
[152:12.23]Could it be a table?
[152:31.48]How about Mario Kart N64 soundtrack?
[152:35.64]I'm liking that one.
[152:36.40]That's better.
[152:36.82]It's even wrong in the picture, too.
[152:44.17]Alright, what was I doing?
[152:48.51]That looks good.
[152:55.17]That looks good.
[152:55.69]I was gonna do... Okay, we have furniture.
[153:05.83]Does it stay open?
[153:11.50]Alright.
[153:12.72]Color for out here.
[153:16.84]Let's go with A. Bright pink.
[153:22.57]Bright lavender is way too obvious.
[153:31.61]Heavy green?
[153:36.15]No, it's too dark.
[153:37.69]Way too dark.
[153:42.91]Battle?
[153:44.51]Select your player.
[153:49.32]Yossi!
[153:51.32]Select your level.
[153:53.12]What's happening?
[153:56.34]Oh, I've just kind of channeled that.
[154:02.64]Sorry about that.
[154:04.06]We're going with blood.
[154:07.06]No, not blood.
[154:10.02]Not dark lavender.
[154:10.85]Should I try blood red?
[154:16.47]Let's see what it looks like.
[154:35.21]It's got to be lights in here.
[154:38.71]Redrum.
[154:40.83]Redrum!
[154:42.15]You know, you do that voice by sucking in air, but I don't know if I can do that right now.
[154:46.42]With my chest.
[154:49.02]I could, I would really be able to do like that.
[154:51.76]I would be able to do it, but I can't do that right now.
[154:58.72]Ah, voice lost.
[154:59.78]Gained.
[155:02.22]Dr. Fauci lost.
[155:05.27]Red rum.
[155:08.16]Damn it.
[155:14.76]I think that's a really good trade.
[155:23.04]I'll take that a thousand times.
[155:35.32]Alright, can somebody select a level?
[155:38.10]And pick what mode we're gonna play?
[155:39.78]This is also panic-inducing.
[155:52.55]Like, why have you not picked?
[155:53.53]So, why have you take- it's taking you this long?
[155:56.95]Pick a level!
[155:57.91]And pick the- please!
[155:59.39]Pick a character!
[156:03.50]I've never heard this song for this long and it's freaking me out.
[156:06.68]I've only heard this song for ten straight seconds.
[156:10.22]Never five minutes.
[156:11.46]This is an audio sensation I've never had and I don't want it anymore.
[156:21.40]Skip it.
[156:22.76]I can't.
[156:31.19]There we are.
[156:41.27]That's what you heard every single time And then the occasional
[157:07.37]There's always Luigi too.
[157:08.91]Luigi would always get hit by something in the very beginning.
[157:11.69]Nobody even had to run over one of those cubes.
[157:14.11]Luigi just got hurt every time.
[157:23.46]You would hear his I got hit sound from across the game.
[157:34.88]Do the toad falling off the map.
[157:37.50]That's what I think it is.
[157:38.38]It's a Tasmanian devil where I have to go all out for it.
[157:44.40]This is only one way you do that.
[157:48.94]This is going to be hard to do.
[157:54.30]If I nail this.
[158:09.60]Try it again.
[158:14.17]Nope.
[158:14.69]I tried twice.
[158:15.21]It's hard.
[158:15.71]I'll try it one more time.
[158:17.35]Oh, I won't do it again.
[158:18.35]I can't.
[158:18.67]I can't do it.
[158:20.95]I cannot do it.
[158:38.08]Good effort!
[158:39.28]Yeah.
[158:44.70]Make a painting noise?
[158:45.90]Should this be- wait, this room's not supposed to be blood red?
[158:50.34]I could probably do it without yelling.
[159:10.18]You can't unless you can't it's not possible You have to when you say When you say well out loud you have to be that person's actual voice you nobody can do that No, that was not the worst noise 2028 over yet.
[159:33.55]Alright
[159:43.11]It's not it wasn't no no no it wasn't Hey, I can't hold on I have so much trouble I need to paint these walls blue So I don't listen to music
[160:08.22]You guys know the secret, the real reason why I don't listen to music?
[160:12.90]Because my ADHD brain and not listen to it, I have to focus on it.
[160:18.75]And when I focus on it, I lose complete everything.
[160:24.69]All I can see right now in my mind, I can't see anything or hear anything else besides the banjo.
[160:33.65]I'm playing it visually on the screen.
[160:50.53]Okay, we're fixed.
[160:51.11]Missed a spot?
[160:56.81]Did I?
[161:14.09]Somebody said... I was trying... Ugh.
[161:19.30]Didn't finish the blue room.
[161:20.58]What?
[161:20.80]I don't like that.
[161:25.82]What should be over here?
[161:28.10]Looks good.
[161:28.96]This looks good.
[161:29.70]Put a bunch of trash in here.
[161:54.79]Turn this shit off.
[161:55.97]That's better.
[162:08.22]I was reading what somebody said.
[162:09.28]Okay, let's go to paint.
[162:13.93]Now this all can stay the same.
[162:15.13]I just need some junk in here.
[162:16.81]Is it just like a junk category?
[162:27.79]I just need, uh... Definitely need one of these.
[162:33.06]Make it less loud.
[162:35.56]Here we go!
[162:54.94]Okay.
[162:55.40]Cool.
[162:56.76]I like it.
[162:58.18]Just needs to... Should this just go all the way around?
[163:00.42]Do people paint their garages?
[163:06.11]White.
[163:06.43]Yeah, just white.
[163:28.13]So funky, and it's a low volume.
[163:29.91]Funky.
[163:39.55]This is the Aqua Teen house.
[163:41.69]I'm trying to get away from the Aqua Teen house.
[163:43.31]It's not the Aqua Teen house.
[163:51.70]It is.
[164:04.04]Maybe a little?
[164:06.96]You made the Aqua Teen house through muscle reflexes.
[164:21.29]That's so funny to me because that means I've done this potentially thousands of times.
[164:27.34]Am I such a huge Aqua Teen fan that I gotta get it right one day?
[164:35.04]I did not make the Aqua Teen house through muscle memory.
[164:40.04]I haven't seen an episode of that show in probably five years.
[164:43.81]I have paint.
[165:00.46]Yeah.

[165:42.97]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[165:47.01]No, absolutely not.
[165:50.51]I mean, this, this has to be, this has to have money in it.
[165:55.23]Right?
[165:57.29]For this to work, like, oh, there's nothing in here, but there's like a dollar, there's two dollars in here.
[166:14.57]It's a spoon.
[166:18.71]I can't put the spoon in there?
[166:20.79]Bullshit.
[166:28.12]Uh.
[166:29.14]This is an FPS house.
[166:34.02]Like, okay, I come in here.
[166:35.92]Oh, look, there's like an item over here in the item spot.
[166:40.28]Oh, it's like 10 ammo.
[166:44.57]Weird, fucked up kitchen.
[166:45.93]Like, guy, like, up two monsters.
[166:47.57]Boom, boom.
[166:48.25]Like, ugh!
[166:49.63]Turn this way.
[166:51.21]Like, somebody jumps through here.
[166:52.38]Weird clock and weird room.
[166:57.42]And then into the garage, down the stairs.
[166:59.64]I did it already.
[167:08.34]This is what makes it, like... Whatever.
[167:21.70]This is a PUBG house.
[167:26.88]There you go.
[167:27.58]Good.
[167:28.38]It's a PUBG house.
[167:29.76]You missed a spot.
[167:37.68]Oops.
[167:43.28]Add purple loot.
[167:45.96]I mean, I could probably put, like, images on the ground.
[167:47.68]Like, paintings on the ground of just, like, Fortnite weapons.
[167:53.47]But then that becomes a full-on FPS house, and we're not there.
[167:56.04]We're not doing that.
[168:01.80]Like, have this open, and have there be, like, three or four purple items on the ground.
[168:14.03]Good.
[168:14.81]Alright, no more paint.
[168:28.38]Backyard?
[168:28.94]Is this gas back here?
[168:32.88]What happened over here?
[168:33.58]Oh, right.
[168:33.96]I was gonna... Project for a different day.
[168:36.06]I think this is good.
[168:44.54]I think this works.
[168:51.10]Welcome.
[168:55.42]This paint's gotta change, though.
[168:56.50]Alright, what can you see when you look in here?
[168:58.98]Something to steal?
[169:10.85]It's flawed.
[169:11.81]It's flawed.
[169:12.23]It can't be in here.
[169:24.14]Let's make that better.
[169:24.84]How do you spell fluorescent?
[169:35.91]How do you spell?
[169:37.15]Floor?
[169:38.79]S?
[169:40.15]Fluorescent?
[169:44.87]U?
[169:45.03]Is it U first?
[169:45.77]It's fluorescent.
[169:49.37]Fluorescent.
[169:49.97]Okay.
[169:51.11]I was close.
[169:54.01]Oh, man.
[169:55.17]Oh, no.
[169:55.85]I thought this was a play bar.
[169:58.43]Like, the video was supposed to be up here, and it's like, this is the play bar.
[170:01.67]I was like, what do I click on?
[170:13.68]Get one light.
[170:16.86]You Redditor.
[170:17.66]I'm not making a joke.
[170:23.72]That's not a joke.
[170:25.52]I promise you that.
[170:26.26]If you can believe one thing today, it's not me making a joke.
[170:35.14]It's like it's trying to load an ad.
[170:39.99]It's an image of a TV on the wall.
[170:42.17]It's not a bad idea.
[170:46.65]Don't use fluorescents.
[170:52.82]There's not even a light switch.
[170:56.95]I think we're done with the upstairs.
[170:58.85]There's this one space here, which I guess we could put like expensive stuff in the walls.
[171:03.21]How about this?
[171:05.05]Very like a... It's like a cabinet.
[171:12.82]Those are way too nice.
[171:32.35]This really is making an FPS in something that's not a video game engine.
[171:45.46]You know what I mean?
[171:54.78]Like this wasn't made in Unreal.
[171:56.64]This was made in a video game that uses Unreal.
[172:11.06]Put guns.
[172:16.02]That is unreal.
[172:16.90]No, no, I think you're missing what I'm saying.
[172:19.44]It's not unreal.
[172:21.04]You don't open, like, Unreal Engine and go in the engine and make a game.
[172:24.19]You make the game in the game that already exists.
[172:28.77]But that game is using assets from Unreal Engine.
[172:34.98]Like, like, uh, like Garry's Mod or something.
[172:36.78]You don't, like, go and encode in the engine.
[172:49.84]He's rambling.
[172:51.54]What?
[172:55.00]What are you talking about?
[172:55.82]I'm talking about Game Maker Studio 4 or something.
[173:02.54]You don't make this in Unreal Engine.
[173:07.08]Actually, you do code.
[173:08.93]All code is in Engine.
[173:12.69]He's not wrong.
[173:13.83]I feel like I'm questioning my whole life right now.
[173:29.20]Stop bragging.
[173:30.94]I think it's time to start my house.
[173:35.04]What do you think?
[173:37.14]We'll tidy up upstairs.
[173:45.06]It's so dirty over here.
[173:46.06]Why is it so dirty down here?
[173:55.21]Had to change it.
[174:01.58]Alright, this is gonna be my real house.
[174:03.69]This is my real bathroom.
[174:09.55]This is my real house here.
[174:13.35]Get to work.
[174:16.69]You come in here.
[174:17.49]Wall.
[174:18.47]What's in the way?
[174:33.50]FPS boss fight.
[174:43.38]It's not a boss fight.
[174:44.70]Okay, we're fine.
[174:47.04]I'm the boss?
[174:47.78]Do I just stand down here?
[174:49.38]I really am making an FPS fucking level.
[174:53.28]No!
[174:54.28]This is supposed to be like trick the- this is the prank house.
[174:57.26]This is trick the guy to come in here.
[175:00.66]The guy comes in here.
[175:01.36]You're tricking him with all kinds of weird tricks.
[175:04.68]He finally makes it around here.
[175:06.08]He gets down to you.
[175:07.16]This is a level.
[175:07.84]That's a level.
[175:09.26]You try to stop the main character from coming down to you.
[175:11.59]Like secret stash of stuff that you have behind you.
[175:13.65]And you're the guy with like the gun.
[175:14.67]What happened?
[175:28.54]Okay, I'm ready to... Damn it.
[175:31.46]My vision.
[175:36.84]Yo, dude.
[175:37.70]Charles Entertainment Cheese is streaming.
[175:48.83]I hope so.
[175:49.41]That would be, like, funny.
[175:50.47]Okay.
[175:52.69]Furniture.
[175:53.19]I need a huge bed.
[176:00.23]How many rooms should my house be?
[176:07.96]Is this, is this, this can be over here.
[176:10.44]This is gonna turn.
[176:17.35]Should be... The room before the room.
[176:30.47]How much space do I have?
[176:31.39]Okay, this is a room here.
[176:33.05]This is a room here.
[176:34.85]This is a room here.
[176:35.67]Okay, right here.
[176:39.46]I gotta block this out and then I can look at it later and figure it out.
[176:47.20]Bathroom here.
[176:47.92]There's gonna be a door there, which leads into this room.
[176:51.14]Which then, this is a hallway.
[177:01.38]Then this is a room.
[177:02.88]Alright, let's figure this out.
[177:06.71]Bathroom.
[177:11.29]The door here.
[177:14.33]Right here.
[177:15.17]That looks good.
[177:23.89]You gotta go.
[177:24.42]Have a good stream.
[177:25.00]Well, thanks for coming.
[177:27.16]Hope your day is filled with pleasantries.
[177:32.55]Alright, that's where a door is going to go.
[177:37.68]And then this is... A door is going to go... Where am I?
[177:42.58]Wait, what is that?
[177:43.30]What room is this?
[177:45.68]Okay, that's bathroom?
[177:47.98]Okay, right here.
[178:02.35]This is making me irrationally angry that it's not right here.
[178:06.59]The door has to line up with this door.
[178:12.18]Fill the basement with mirrors.
[178:13.48]I cannot do mirrors again.
[178:14.62]I will puke.
[178:16.08]Okay, that looks fine.
[178:20.42]We go through here.
[178:24.37]There's a hallway here.
[178:26.73]This leads to here.
[178:27.85]And then...
[178:31.76]This is a room.
[178:33.38]Bathroom, room, hallway, room.
[178:40.53]Wait.
[179:10.38]So this is a hallway here.
[179:11.72]I'm gonna have to put a medpack right there.
[179:18.90]This is my room.
[179:20.45]This is the bathroom.
[179:21.37]It's all leading to the bathroom.
[179:30.73]You're making an airsoft house now?
[179:39.29]I don't know if that means, but I think it's funny.
[179:44.38]Door.
[179:47.78]Door, door, internal door.
[179:55.39]Get out of the way.
[180:08.04]Cool.
[180:08.84]Door.
[180:08.98]Alright.
[180:14.09]Kind of weird how it opens.
[180:15.09]This rainbow road?
[180:17.72]Yup.
[180:40.80]What happened?
[180:47.89]Who's down?
[180:48.39]Why does it look wrong?
[181:20.08]Okay, we heard one that went through once.
[181:23.28]Turn it down.
[181:25.72]Look, this is the electric guitar part.
[181:32.31]Okay, door.
[181:56.98]Okay, let's go.
[181:58.10]Oh god.
[182:05.14]This is to go to the bathroom.
[182:13.01]Honestly, you don't even need to have a door on the bathroom.
[182:15.07]I can make this a super bathroom.
[182:25.34]Somebody said this is a filler house?
[182:34.86]Filler house.
[182:36.58]I love that term.
[182:46.15]God.
[182:48.29]Get out of here.
[183:30.20]There's the shower.
[183:36.24]Fuck.
[183:41.90]Did anyone know what this is called?
[183:42.98]What is this noise called?
[183:45.04]I hear it everywhere.
[183:46.24]And I never- What do you search for?
[183:47.60]Like, keyboard sound?
[183:51.04]Woo!
[183:51.58]There's no way- What is it called?
[184:14.67]I don't know how this is somehow worse than the Mirror House to me.
[184:18.69]Yeah, this is worse than the Mirror House.
[184:19.85]I don't like it down here.
[184:20.67]This is supposed to be my dream house.
[184:22.73]It's unsettling.
[184:33.32]It is.
[184:34.54]It's really unsettling.
[184:35.94]I don't like it.
[184:37.38]It's making me wicked uncomfortable.
[184:44.85]Or maybe it's the Baldi's Basics thing in the background.
[184:49.15]Why are we going so fast?
[184:58.46]No, I don't- I have to get rid of this.
[185:00.02]This actually is gonna hurt my head.
[185:01.38]We're gonna keep this.
[185:18.01]That was- there was another three or four minutes on that.
[185:31.37]Now, I made an FPS house, but this is a really- this is not even a good FPS level.
[185:36.76]This is- I- I forgot to remove some of this stuff when I was making the game.
[185:55.99]puzzle game now I'll make him no dream house that's fine take this down did he make another joke house so halfway half joke house now this is real house
[186:29.64]I want to actually make my stuff awesome down here.
[186:37.67]There's the door.
[186:38.53]Remember, it's supposed to be a secret.
[186:40.65]So when you come in here, this room here is just storage.
[186:47.33]Like a closet.
[186:48.65]This is the house.
[186:49.37]Welcome.
[186:49.94]Welcome.
[186:58.99]Welcome.
[186:59.55]Okay, let's do floor.
[187:01.35]Search by price.
[187:03.42]Ooh, I like this little explosive.
[187:40.02]I don't know, we gotta get rid of these brick walls.
[187:46.08]Walls are killing it for me.
[187:48.24]My perfect wall.
[187:50.94]I'm being serious.
[187:53.24]My absolute, my go-to, the wall I actually like.
[187:58.89]Is gray.
[188:07.44]Gray, beige.
[188:08.14]No, no, no.
[188:09.18]Was that silver gray?
[188:15.74]Silver glacier.
[188:16.62]Look at that.
[188:18.42]Looks so nice.
[188:23.33]You're boring.
[188:25.23]That's fine.
[188:28.23]But I actually truly enjoy the shades of gray.
[188:36.28]The best part about gray is there are so many shades.
[188:39.78]You get a blue.
[188:41.96]Light blue.
[188:47.91]It's like, you can put gray, like brown, gray, beige.
[188:51.41]Yeah, there's about 50.
[188:54.19]I'd say there's probably 50.
[188:56.50]I'm a huge fan of all the 50.
[189:02.06]Big fan.
[189:12.94]I didn't even complete it I didn't even you know I didn't even want to complete it because it was so easy I didn't want to complete it you guys did that's fine I didn't I'm not gonna complete that one alright looking good see what I actually believe that though
[189:41.13]I truly do believe that I like gray.
[189:47.16]I like all the shades of gray.
[189:50.24]I like blue gray.
[189:52.10]I like brown gray.
[189:53.18]I like them.
[190:04.17]There are two different grays.
[190:10.79]Prove it.
[190:12.12]Eat gray on stream.
[190:13.24]I don't think I would want to eat anything gray on stream.
[190:24.72]Because gray is like mold.
[190:28.16]Alright, I don't like the floors.
[190:31.71]Floors have to change.
[190:40.96]floor panels and covering.
[190:42.21]Alright.
[190:43.85]So the most expensive thing is this carpet.
[190:45.79]I don't like that carpet.
[190:49.25]What is it?
[190:50.47]How is wood more expensive?
[190:54.02]How is wood less expensive than carpet?
[191:02.44]In a perfect world, this would be Tile.
[191:07.58]It is.
[191:07.82]It would be Tile.
[191:10.50]I'm sorry, everybody.
[191:33.30]Just let me get a look at it first before everybody freaks out.
[191:49.73]This is not a perfect world.
[191:50.85]Come on here.
[191:52.84]Expensive.
[192:02.47]I would definitely, this is what I would want.
[192:05.43]But I can't set how many, how big I want it.
[192:22.33]This is a normie house.
[192:28.04]So it's a normal house.
[192:30.34]Just a regular house.
[192:31.54]What kind of house do you want to live in?
[192:36.45]I mean, we made the joke about having a discovery zone in your backyard, but is that... Is that so weird to want to just live in a normal house?
[193:07.51]Can I not put this anywhere?
[193:08.27]Oh, there.
[193:23.53]Okay, what's the most expensive fireplace?
[193:26.91]Okay, here we go.
[193:27.81]Galactic sauna heater.
[193:30.92]Electric fireplace.
[193:32.90]Yeah, look at this and it's already gray.
[193:34.57]I don't need to do anything.
[193:36.43]I won't know I'd like the smoky gray That looks so good dude.
[193:43.01]Oh my god.
[193:44.47]Give it to me today Where can I pick this up?
[193:48.40]Where can I pick this up?
[193:49.44]I want that look at how look at that.
[193:51.44]Oh
[193:59.00]It's so angular, and there's so much, like, the material.
[194:03.51]I love, like, that shiny stone.
[194:19.98]Ugh.
[194:22.96]Don't you just want to live just inside of that?
[194:31.79]Okay.
[194:40.82]We need some shelving units.
[194:49.24]Furniture, we need the most expensive awesome ass couch.
[194:55.97]This one, but I don't want it blue.
[195:09.56]It's actually pretty good.
[195:10.56]That looks good.
[195:36.44]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[195:39.02]When am I ever expecting seven people to come over?
[195:42.60]Wait, can this be saved?
[196:05.31]Those cold nights, you know what I mean?
[196:20.13]I need a place to sleep.
[196:51.26]Yeah, I know.
[196:51.78]I know this is an evil guy bed.
[196:53.46]This is an evil sorcerer bed.
[196:57.71]But it's the most expensive thing.
[197:22.22]I won.
[197:23.61]Nice.
[198:18.39]This is my dream house that means I have a fixture built into the structure That is a bathroom that I can go take a shit and play video games on like I used to do when I was like a kid Used to what what question marks
[198:45.82]When I was younger, up until probably I was like 20, whenever laptops became small enough to use, I used to bring my entire computer into the bathroom and set the whole thing up.
[198:57.76]And just be on the computer and play games and shit while I took a shit.
[199:04.23]And then I had to take all of it out.
[199:05.57]And after I was satisfied and done, and it was over, the daunting task of now I have to redo my whole computer setup.
[199:15.48]for, like, maybe, like, an hour and 12 minutes worth of enjoyment.
[199:24.89]Not anymore.
[199:27.45]Because now, if this is my dream home, this is permanent here.
[199:30.15]This is a dedicated computer in here.
[199:33.95]I don't think there'll be two computers.
[199:37.12]Sorry that you don't know that.
[199:43.20]And there's a little heater right there.
[199:46.00]Monit... Am I writing Minotaur?
[199:49.80]Monitor!
[200:02.04]He told us this story.
[200:02.92]Yeah, but I never made it in my dream house.
[200:09.92]Wait, I need a little stool.
[200:31.32]No, now you've lost.
[200:38.74]Really?
[200:49.93]Like a little corner table.
[201:05.97]Come on, man.
[201:20.26]What's this even doing in here?
[201:21.36]That's not in my dream house.
[201:42.07]Okay, this is for like drinks and shit.
[201:44.67]This is for the mouse and keyboard.
[201:49.66]Right here.
[201:50.66]Toilet.
[202:09.51]Toilet plumbing system.
[202:23.40]Spoil it!
[202:26.63]Okay, how long is this?
[202:30.17]Skip next, please.
[202:46.26]Yep.
[203:25.24]Damn it.
[203:26.14]Damn it.
[203:26.70]I gotta move the... I gotta move the toilet.
[203:30.72]No, I don't.
[203:34.20]This can be different.
[203:34.80]Doesn't have to be the same.
[203:41.69]Let's do the little thing.
[203:43.39]How about this?
[203:43.73]How big is this?
[203:49.95]The ultimate gamer throne.
[203:53.89]Get in there.
[203:57.27]Or the wall?
[203:57.93]No, it doesn't need to be that big.
[204:10.50]Just need a little thing.
[204:11.64]A little tiny little thing.
[204:25.34]Got it.
[204:25.62]This is perfect.
[204:28.38]Perfect reach too, you see?
[204:31.34]You're sitting here, your arm is right there.
[204:33.30]Alright, here's the next part of this.
[204:48.91]How do you get in here reliably?
[204:54.40]I know.
[204:54.70]You just drag it.
[204:58.22]It stores over here.
[204:59.20]And then when you're ready to go to the bathroom, you like... Just slide it over.
[205:06.70]And keyboard.
[205:26.25]Look at that.
[205:27.31]And the keyboard will just sit on my lap.
[205:32.45]A couple of drinks.
[205:33.75]Maybe dinner.
[205:35.72]Food.
[205:43.68]Keyboard.
[205:44.12]Go.
[205:48.79]Go.
[205:49.03]Go.
[205:50.69]Yeah, look at this.
[206:00.81]And I can just sit down.
[206:01.83]There's the mouse.
[206:02.92]Keyboard right on the lap.
[206:04.68]I could even get like a little keyboard tray if I really wanted to.
[206:06.90]I need a shower, don't I?
[206:19.52]Oh.
[206:20.90]Well, I need a shower.
[206:21.84]I can still get in and out.
[206:39.73]just my sodas drinks soda um water or like what would it even be under
[207:09.40]I think the walls have to be white.
[207:12.41]Like, teeth white.
[207:14.09]Colgate white.
[207:14.77]Yeah, I already like it better.
[207:40.05]This is public bathroom vibe.
[207:49.02]I don't like that.
[207:49.56]Green tile in bathroom always means public bathroom.
[208:12.30]You're just painting over the tiles.
[208:15.40]Yeah, it's a video game.
[208:16.66]It's okay.
[208:17.14]That'd be pretty messed up.
[208:21.06]I agree.
[208:28.05]Oh no!
[208:29.33]Now it's just a not rendered room!
[208:32.47]Now this has to change too!
[208:40.48]Ball.
[208:42.48]But it looks good.
[208:43.28]These?
[208:48.78]Try these.
[208:50.74]But I'll do what they did.
[208:54.56]Why does it look like I made it a colored pencil?
[209:26.29]Yoshi's Island wall
[209:51.97]Hold on.
[209:54.75]I'm going to put these... It's supposed to be two.
[210:00.15]One.
[210:00.83]Two.
[210:03.09]I'm going to fix it.
[210:03.77]Don't worry.
[210:09.80]Hey, Mario.
[210:13.14]I baked you a delicious cake.
[210:15.30]Peach from Mario 64's Mickey Mouse.
[210:34.45]I have some kind of Mario syndrome, right?
[210:45.70]I read like a book.
[210:47.84]And Mario music is now like, here I go.
[210:49.82]I do it now.
[210:58.45]One, two, one, go.
[211:00.41]Wait.
[211:01.25]Don't say, here we go, either.
[211:02.29]Here we go.
[211:02.73]Here we go!
[211:05.19]I have to go.
[211:06.45]I gotta get out of here.
[211:11.21]One, two.
[211:18.58]Yo, I promise you'll like this when it's done.
[211:20.94]You don't walk into a construction before it's even close and say, this looks ugly.
[211:25.06]Like, yeah, dude, because I'm not even fucking done.
[211:30.94]Irma's bathroom is mad stinky.
[211:36.06]I hate that you wrote that.
[212:20.83]Fuck you.
[212:21.53]No.
[212:22.47]That was the equivalent of hitting my thumb.
[212:25.79]But if this were real life, I would have wished I hit my thumb.
[212:29.03]Because I just might have destroyed the house.
[212:43.24]Okay, so this is one, two, one, two.
[212:52.34]one one two one two one two one one two one one two one it's wrapped in here
[213:25.90]Pile.
[213:27.26]Wall pile.
[213:30.38]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[213:35.62]Oh, nice.
[213:37.44]Nice.
[213:47.81]Oh, oh.

[215:05.27]No more music.
[215:07.15]No more music.
[215:09.17]It's off.
[215:09.43]It's not coming back.
[215:10.69]No more Mario fucking slide down the slide songs.
[215:13.00]They just fuck up my brain.
[215:31.29]Yeah, without music, like, streamers suck, huh?
[215:36.16]Damn.
[215:43.68]Alright.
[215:44.06]Now, where am I going to go now?
[215:46.00]What over here?
[215:49.48]Hey guys.
[215:53.04]Pog.
[215:55.12]Champ.
[216:00.36]I missed one where?
[216:03.00]Did not miss one.
[216:08.16]I'm aware it looks like a cathedral.
[216:10.42]That, what do you think we are?
[216:11.52]This is, I'm on the throne here, man.
[216:16.32]This is a sacred fucking room.
[216:17.70]I know it looks like a Binding of Isaac angel room, but forget about that.
[216:21.97]It is an angel room for me.
[216:23.17]Background.
[216:28.49]Background looks like it's gotta go.
[216:54.36]There's no sink.
[216:57.44]Yet.
[217:04.63]What do you wipe with?
[217:05.49]I mean, that's the easy fix.
[217:19.05]That's the easiest fix all day.
[217:23.09]I typed in toilet paper.
[217:38.21]Here comes the genius play here.
[217:48.85]You know how long this is gonna last?
[217:50.69]You ever run out of toilet paper and you go, oh shit, that sucks.
[217:53.16]Not anymore.
[217:59.74]You only need to refill this once a year.
[218:13.32]Much longer than that.
[218:15.06]One roll of toilet paper every month.
[218:16.74]This is probably like a month worth of toilet paper, right?
[218:18.67]A month or two?
[218:21.25]That's better.
[218:21.63]What do you mean a month?
[218:30.56]This is two weeks.
[218:38.07]two wait four but are we talking like the shaman mega rolls are we talking like the scots sandpaper rolls what are we talking about here I'm going by I'm going by by shaman ultra mega soft ultra rolls
[219:05.83]Four Ultra Soft Mega Charmin rolls is four rolls of toilet paper.
[219:12.44]So this is actually four, eight, twelve, sixteen.
[219:28.99]Yeah, I don't- this blood red shit's gotta go.
[219:34.23]Where's the sink?
[219:35.05]I don't worry.
[219:35.87]I'm working on it.
[219:36.89]It's gonna be right here.
[219:37.85]Alright.
[219:43.59]I need to make this door only open inside.
[219:46.35]I don't want it to open both ways.
[219:50.39]Why can't it do that, by the way?
[219:52.97]I only want it to go this way.
[219:57.35]I don't... A double hinged door?
[219:59.31]Ah.
[220:03.27]What a room.
[220:06.25]Okay.
[220:07.27]Let's go here.
[220:11.51]Make a race car bed.
[220:13.91]My dream house is... This is not big enough.
[220:18.99]This is definitely a dream bathroom, for sure.
[220:20.45]Put some more expensive shit in here.
[220:34.42]This is way better.
[220:48.96]Way better.
[220:52.73]Put a bunch of plants.
[220:55.21]Is it like jewelry?
[220:56.87]Tell me I can have a grand piano down here?
[220:59.47]Uh, yeah.
[221:06.63]Can I play it?
[221:16.90]Get a Christmas tree down here.
[221:24.58]Italian luffer bed?
[221:33.49]What is all this?
[221:34.21]Hold on.
[221:37.45]Clown mask?
[221:42.47]Holy shit, it actually exists!
[221:47.01]It's in the... Remember we were talking about this yesterday?
[221:51.93]Why are these in here?
[222:04.04]Wow!
[222:06.16]It's for the streamer room.
[222:15.19]Content creator room.
[222:17.98]Alright, I don't need a bed.
[222:18.82]I don't- I don't want a piano either.
[222:28.67]Hold on, let me... What is the big- what's the biggest TV?
[222:39.81]I want a huge TV.
[222:43.92]Ball mounted TV.
[222:45.42]Like, extra large.
[222:51.96]I'm gonna do what they do at the bar.
[223:03.62]Now I can watch every game.
[223:04.82]Okay.
[223:15.95]Spy headquarters.
[223:21.18]No, this is the prank room.
[223:23.66]No, this is the prank room.
[223:25.28]That's not what I want.
[223:33.42]That's not what I want, but I'm gonna make a nice couch.
[223:39.00]You're a stock market guy.
[223:40.32]I need a big expensive couch.
[223:51.31]These are all huge.
[223:52.25]This one right here.
[224:09.58]Come on, fit.
[224:11.84]Fit!
[224:22.82]I can't break this.
[224:23.54]I need a small one.
[224:36.74]Okay.
[224:37.04]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[224:38.42]There we go.
[224:49.04]There we go.
[224:53.50]No, I don't... But I don't like this one either.
[224:54.96]No, this is like a Nickelodeon couch.
[224:59.60]I don't want that.
[225:00.12]That's the Snick couch.
[225:12.01]Uh... I need something though.
[225:17.29]There's a big bed?
[225:26.84]What if I do this?
[225:29.52]This is my dream home.
[225:30.50]Remember I told you about this a long time ago?
[225:47.37]Where is it?
[225:48.43]Is it just a... I just want a mattress.
[225:59.14]Mattress, mattress, mattress.
[226:08.39]Dog bed.
[226:16.07]No.
[226:20.10]I actually kind of like the way this bed looks.
[226:28.28]This is perfect.
[226:34.33]You get your own personal... I lost some kind of weird bet there.
[226:43.00]Somebody just screamed in Discord and they were like, told you four of them were upside down.
[226:51.13]Congratulations on whoever that was.
[226:59.21]I don't like the aesthetic in here.
[227:00.35]I'm gonna change this shit right now before I get pissed off.
[227:04.67]We're gonna do... This is the bedroom.
[227:15.56]Hmm... Faded Lemon?
[227:17.17]Can't really go wrong with Faded Lemon, I don't think.
[227:30.66]Ass thickness.
[227:33.62]Yes, what he said.
[227:59.94]He did a mispronunciation joke?
[228:01.48]Oh my god.
[228:01.98]Oh my god LOL I can't breathe.
[228:03.54]What did I do?
[228:06.11]What word did I like make a mispronunciation joke on?
[228:14.43]What am I opening?
[228:19.95]What did I open?
[228:27.95]Oh the door.
[228:39.05]Oh, fucking laugh out loud wall joke.
[228:44.69]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[228:48.23]You don't need that wall.
[228:50.90]Where am I going to hang all my TVs?
[228:52.26]I'm going to get a nice big landscape painting of a city.
[229:04.64]It always goes right here.
[229:16.09]Let him make his dream house.
[229:17.21]Hey, I'm trying to just make my dream house!
[229:23.95]You have no style, Megalo.
[229:30.41]I need style for some reason?
[229:34.30]You think I'm worried about my style?
[229:35.84]I wear Star Wars shirts and jeans from Target every day.
[229:42.00]I don't know.
[229:43.14]And I don't really pay attention.
[229:57.59]What do I want in my bedroom?
[230:01.29]Carpet, definitely.
[230:03.03]But it's got to be a nice, long, flush carpet.
[230:09.23]Only in the bedroom.
[230:13.89]With a ton of padding.
[230:17.22]Not so much padding where it feels like you're walking around on a diaper.
[230:20.80]I've been in those places before, and I don't like it.
[230:23.64]It even makes the diaper sound when you walk on it.
[230:25.62]I don't like that.
[230:45.89]You guys never walked around on a really, really absurdly padded carpet?
[230:51.40]And it makes this like weird, swishy, crunchy, like I'm wearing a diaper walking around sound?
[231:07.22]Like, it's, it's, like, I can't even describe it.
[231:10.34]It's the you're stepping on heavy padded carpet sound.
[231:13.61]Almost like they didn't take the, like, the plastic tape off of it.
[231:17.53]They left it on or something.
[231:19.50]Crinkle, yeah, yeah, crinkle, crinkle.
[231:38.66]Carpets are a pain in the ass.
[231:39.68]Get hardwood.
[231:43.29]I like carpets.
[231:44.75]Only in certain places.
[231:45.59]I like carpets in bedrooms.
[231:49.13]It's cozier that way for me.
[231:59.28]Okay, cool.
[232:05.59]Sometimes I think Jerma just makes up weird scenarios and adds some weird noise to it to make us go, what the fuck is this guy on about?
[232:19.88]You know, my friends have said the same thing.
[232:23.19]It's interesting.
[232:25.65]It's interesting.
[232:26.89]Most of the people in my life have asked that same question.
[232:33.27]And the answer is,
[232:36.28]You never know.
[232:42.80]I'll be telling the truth this time, but this time, fucking what?
[232:45.64]Nope.
[232:46.98]I could be lying this time, but telling you the complete truth this time.
[232:50.48]That guy, you'll never know anything.
[232:54.41]It'll always be a fucking mystery.
[232:59.93]That's what somebody says when all of it is real.
[233:04.40]To make sure that you go, oh, okay, he must be fucking around half the time.
[233:08.28]I got you.
[233:08.88]I got you!
[233:09.56]Let's get a good panning here.
[233:21.53]Is this upside down?
[233:22.19]Alright, I thought... I thought it was a bunch of, like, geese.
[233:28.10]I thought it was, like, geese, like goose heads.
[233:39.16]Like, look at it from here.
[233:40.48]This is like a goose body, long goose neck.
[233:43.98]Like, long necks.
[233:51.02]I know it's a horse.
[233:56.80]One more painting.
[234:05.35]Hey, what the fuck is this guy on about?
[234:11.51]At least one guy gets it.
[234:13.15]I'm happy.
[234:21.30]I like this.
[234:23.40]Medium.
[234:30.11]Doesn't really match the... It kind of does.
[234:38.33]It looks alright.
[234:41.27]I need a bureau or a draw.
[234:44.48]How do you, what should I say?
[234:45.58]Draw?
[234:50.40]A hospital bed.
[234:54.42]Furniture.
[234:56.32]Cupboards, desks, armchairs.
[235:00.85]Have you done a cupboard?
[235:02.15]Here we go.
[235:04.03]Wardrobe.
[235:04.87]That's what I'm looking for.
[235:05.79]Wardrobe.
[235:21.87]Take it flush.
[235:22.69]I can do it.
[235:26.74]Or I can't.
[235:27.24]Why?
[235:27.44]Oh, yeah, I can.
[235:36.52]That's pretty cool.
[235:37.20]Alright, we need another painting right here.
[235:38.74]Of Autumn Lake?
[235:47.63]Autumn Lake?
[235:52.36]Oh, that's... I don't want that one.
[236:03.40]Hmm.
[236:05.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[236:05.72]I need... Here we go.
[236:09.67]This looks like another TV.
[236:16.11]Too big.
[236:20.01]Oh, Birch!
[236:21.69]Yeah!
[236:22.01]Yeah!
[236:27.47]I need a little end table, like, right... Uh... Here?
[236:34.97]These are all expensive artwork, too.
[236:38.67]I need AC.
[236:46.42]Okay, hold on.
[236:48.28]Water... Washer... Bathtub plumbing system.
[236:50.88]Shower plumbing.
[236:51.78]Oh, I need to do the bathes, too.
[236:55.90]Sink.
[236:56.62]Right, sink, sink, sink, sink, sink.
[237:13.21]There's no problem with a sink.
[237:18.63]Mountable sink.
[237:25.62]Stick it in.
[237:32.39]Above carpet.
[237:35.71]It's okay.
[237:43.91]Put a bucket underneath this.
[237:57.28]Let's go!
[237:57.88]Tighten it!
[238:03.33]I already know what your problem is.
[238:05.25]I fixed it.
[238:05.67]Okay?
[238:09.41]Fuck it.
[238:12.47]Let's go.
[238:13.05]Okay?
[238:25.90]You need a mirror.
[238:30.05]Do I really, though?
[238:31.05]Are you just trying to give me stress?
[238:38.94]Oh, this one's nice.
[239:01.34]Alright.
[239:01.66]Need a towel rack.
[239:05.92]I need a place to bathe.
[239:07.57]Wait, do I just bathe in the sink and use the bucket and stuff?
[239:12.89]Wait.
[239:22.70]That looks wrong.
[239:23.40]Doesn't this look weird?
[239:45.15]There we go.
[239:45.83]Much better.
[239:49.66]Hey, this little room's coming together as a dream room.
[239:59.77]Door there.
[240:05.75]This is a hotel room.
[240:14.28]The sink that's not in the bathroom and hold on.
[240:17.43]There's not that many TVs.
[240:33.94]Just put tiles under the sink.
[240:35.74]Well, that person's got a huge brain.
[240:37.52]Let's listen to them.
[240:49.20]Wait.
[240:49.44]Fucking wrong thing.
[241:11.78]What are the ones in the bathroom?
[241:14.20]And these I don't even know what these are these this is gray.
[241:26.33]Ceramic white?
[241:32.16]Close enough.
[241:34.66]Close enough.
[241:51.55]These?
[241:52.87]No.
[241:53.83]It's too dark.
[241:58.32]These?
[242:07.31]God damn it.
[242:07.97]There.
[242:13.28]Fucking problem solved.
[242:28.35]What's that?
[242:40.92]Better.
[242:41.16]There.
[242:50.79]To the middle.
[242:53.19]I can get it.
[242:53.65]I actually kind of like it.
[242:56.99]I don't hate it.
[243:11.53]I don't hate it.
[243:12.85]I hate this, but that's unavoidable.
[243:14.70]I need a door.
[243:16.60]I'm going to do a white interior door.
[243:21.12]Hold on.
[243:43.13]It's my fucking snack zone.
[243:46.47]You need light down here.
[243:47.41]I'll put some down here.
[243:57.58]Sitting here using the bathroom and doing your business and then reaching into the pickle jar I think might be one of the most heinous things I think I've ever thought of.
[244:13.91]These shouldn't be in the jar like this.
[244:15.95]Any of these jars should not be touched.
[244:20.19]This has to be before you actually do your thing.
[244:24.79]Not after.
[244:25.33]Never after.
[244:27.59]Only before.
[244:28.79]Remember that.
[244:29.31]Just have the jars open.
[244:46.62]Eating and shitting at the same time.
[244:48.24]Jeremy, you're gonna make me throw up.
[244:50.08]Uh, by the way, peanut butter is... I'm replacing all this.
[244:52.17]Peanut butter is my favorite food.
[244:55.73]Yeah, get rid of the disgusting pickles.
[244:57.25]Get rid of the disgusting pickles.
[244:59.07]The nuts can stay.
[245:01.59]Peanut butter is my favorite food.
[245:03.29]I seriously love this shit.
[245:05.13]Kim thinks I am a cereal killer.
[245:09.56]I will sit on the couch and I will eat peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon.
[245:16.83]Is that odd?
[245:17.75]That's strange or?
[245:26.95]No, no, no, no, no.
[245:35.99]No, no, it's not right.
[245:39.99]Is it maybe a little?
[245:44.98]What kind?
[245:46.10]Most of pure sugar.
[245:47.04]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[245:48.02]Not like the... Not like Jif.
[245:52.38]Like the... Like the whatever like... Like if you go to like Whole Foods or something, you can get like the good stuff.
[245:58.84]It's real.
[245:59.88]There's no bullshit.
[246:01.02]The best part.
[246:02.42]Oh, it's like the cream.
[246:04.36]You get like an organic peanut butter.
[246:06.28]Listen to me.
[246:06.90]All of you do this.
[246:08.44]I want you to come back and tell me you did this.
[246:10.66]I want you all to go get one of those organic peanut butters.
[246:17.06]When you get it, don't shake it up and don't Ster it up.
[246:21.10]When you open that up for the first time, let it settle, you're going to get this layer of about a full inch or two of oil.
[246:28.50]Holy shit, all you have to do is you just take that, a teaspoon of that oil, don't mix it up.
[246:36.04]And you can either just do it straight up.
[246:38.56]If you want to do it neat, that's fine.
[246:41.21]Or you can put it in a little dipping container and dip your toast in it.
[246:47.88]Make toast and dunk it into the little peanut, like the peanut butter oil.
[246:52.27]You're welcome for your new favorite snack.
[247:05.14]And if you can get like the oil and some of the peanut butter and you put it on a piece of bread or toast and you make it nice and toasty.
[247:12.12]Peanut oil is incredible.
[247:20.42]It is so delicious.
[247:29.75]Peanut butter oil, not peanut oil.
[247:32.05]Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[247:33.05]But my point still stands.
[247:34.79]Peanut butter oil is very, very, very good.
[247:38.80]I'll just sit there and I will eat little spoonfuls of the peanut butter oil.
[247:44.14]And after every single bite, I do like the lady on the yogurt commercial.
[247:49.40]Like lean back with a spoon in your mouth with the eyes closed.
[247:57.36]Every time.
[248:04.92]Okay, we're good.
[248:05.32]I need a... a shelving.
[248:08.38]What are you talking about?
[248:15.40]I'm talking about eating peanut butter with a spoon.
[248:19.64]Should I put a love on my wall?
[248:35.84]I so badly want to.
[248:44.32]Aww, it's not going to fit anywhere.
[248:50.25]Yes it will.
[248:58.97]I do need a little end table.
[249:09.67]What are you doing?
[249:14.53]Nightstand?
[249:17.51]Pool?
[249:21.16]I just need a little nightstand.
[249:25.62]Elegant wooden coffee table.
[249:38.21]Nice.
[249:46.57]It was made by the same material as the toilet cover.
[249:51.77]Here we are.
[249:54.96]The love room where you can watch anime on six different TVs and play video games to eat peanut butter while you go to the... Yeah.
[250:01.52]Well, I don't... Why... It doesn't have to be anime.
[250:03.50]Now there has to be a ton of expensive items on here.
[250:13.69]Let's go with equipment.
[250:17.36]Other I don't know.
[250:24.04]I thought this was a grenade.
[250:25.00]Okay, let's go to decorations.
[250:40.20]But diamonds.
[250:42.28]Oh, let's see what they have.
[250:46.44]There are weapons, yes.
[250:47.26]You can't use them, but they exist.
[250:50.72]What about vases?
[250:51.45]Is this the most expensive vase you got?
[250:53.79]I mean, it's nice, but... Where will Otto sleep?
[251:10.28]I got you, Raider.
[251:29.06]No, I don't like that.
[251:29.68]It's gotta be dark, but not too dark.
[251:34.18]Shit.
[251:52.25]Otto sleeps in the bed with me.
[251:53.77]So, no, we didn't need that.
[251:56.37]Not under the sink.
[252:06.10]Alright, looking good.
[252:06.84]All these TVs.
[252:08.73]We need more expensive stuff.
[252:10.99]Accessories.
[252:15.45]Bubble kids.
[252:16.27]Wait, this is the most expensive toy?
[252:20.41]Is the fake kids oven stuff?
[252:24.47]Ooh.
[252:28.21]Wait, different color.
[252:51.16]Okay.
[252:52.56]Look at the- and this clock works.
[252:58.18]What else do we need?
[252:58.82]There's more shit.
[253:01.82]More stuff.
[253:02.56]Accessories.
[253:03.24]Accessorize.
[253:09.68]Whoa.
[253:11.24]Whoa!
[253:20.24]That's way cooler.
[253:36.25]Come on.
[253:37.40]Come on.
[253:37.68]I got to get right in the middle.
[253:43.62]Am I in the way?
[253:44.76]I was standing in the way.
[253:57.87]Nice.
[253:58.63]This is such a swaggy apartment.
[254:08.97]Don't ha-ha me.
[254:10.11]Come on.
[254:10.63]What do you think?
[254:11.67]You think I'm serious?
[254:19.47]Facing that way?
[254:20.07]No, I like the other way.
[254:23.62]Right there.
[254:24.10]Nice.
[254:24.96]Alright.
[254:25.60]End table.

[254:36.60]Okay.
[254:37.52]I like it.
[254:39.53]Let's go.
[254:39.89]It's too big.
[254:42.67]Fucking thing sucks.
[254:53.36]We talked about the let's go thing.
[254:56.75]I don't think I could really even scream that loud anymore.
[255:02.93]I really don't think so.
[255:07.64]My voice would give out at the G and go.
[255:11.08]I wouldn't be able to scream it.
[255:19.13]Technique table?
[255:19.73]Come on.
[255:19.97]Why is it just a little end table?
[255:23.43]Right here?
[255:27.69]Nice.
[255:28.59]How's that coloring?
[255:29.96]Is the coloring good?
[255:31.86]Nope.
[255:43.18]Better?
[255:43.40]Alright, good.
[255:45.89]End table.
[255:48.79]Need a light.
[255:50.43]We need expensive lights, is what you meant to say.
[255:53.23]Lamps.
[255:55.27]Uh, ceiling lamps.
[256:00.94]Ooh, this one's cool.
[256:13.97]Let me see this from far away.
[256:14.91]I don't have any measuring tools.
[256:18.39]Is that good?
[256:25.56]Is that, like, right in the middle?
[256:31.06]Wouldn't it be hilarious if Dermot did a stream where FaceCam was... Message was deleted.
[256:38.20]And, uh, slow mode was turned on.
[256:42.76]That would be a pretty weird stream, yeah.
[256:49.34]I need light switches.
[256:55.21]Elegant light switch.
[257:07.41]Ooh!
[257:14.35]Look at this little place, huh?
[257:16.09]Wouldn't you like to call this home?

[258:28.00]Look at this.
[258:28.96]You trying to tell me that this is not a place that you would feel comfortable in.
[258:35.60]You don't think that you would feel... Wait, let me get rid of this.
[258:41.85]Look at this shit.
[258:47.30]Look at that cool light.
[258:48.32]There's no light in the bathroom.
[258:51.84]Yeah, there is.

[259:46.65]Cool.
[259:51.32]Is that the doorbell?
[259:52.22]No, it's a light switch.
[260:00.23]This is a little... I don't like how... This is very barren.
[260:02.57]We're in the middle of the wall?
[260:17.85]Right there?
[260:18.63]But then look, I have this one too.

[260:41.16]They don't see this part.
[260:42.08]They don't see that part.
[260:42.72]They're not allowed in there.
[260:44.23]It's my private room.
[260:52.04]Please rotate the TVs, please.
[260:53.98]Okay.

[261:21.90]Dude, alright, how sick would this actually be, though?
[261:26.87]That would be, that would be, you're telling me this wouldn't be cool?
[261:30.95]If you were lying down in your bed, on your back, just looking down, and you've got, like, a huge entertainment display, which, by the way,
[261:46.56]Just gotta make sure I'm not playing a really, really action-packed movie when somebody goes upstairs.
[261:51.83]Because I'm gonna put in, like, stereo, like a speaker and shit.
[262:05.22]Subwoofer and speaker.
[262:08.48]Here it is.

[262:53.81]I'm gonna take this whole thing down.
[262:55.25]Alright, that's good.
[263:04.90]Then I need a little place for consoles in a course.
[263:09.10]Not a DVD player.
[263:10.12]Is it like an entertainment center?
[263:13.76]Entertainment center.
[263:19.24]What would it be called?
[263:20.70]Furniture?
[263:21.06]I need like an entertainment center.
[263:32.01]This room's too cluttered?

[263:49.24]I gotta be... Of course we do.
[263:54.61]Yeah, I've gotta have way too many dressers in here for this to be allowed in here.
[264:01.52]You know what I mean?
[264:09.58]Alright, there's dresser Andy.
[264:17.98]This is a hoarder room.
[264:19.20]No, alright.
[264:20.56]Get rid of this.
[264:24.48]This is the cleanest hoarder room I think I may have ever seen.
[264:29.66]This is not a hoarder room.
[264:33.10]Not even close.
[264:34.34]Alright, what was I doing?
[264:38.61]I'm looking for... Okay.

[266:03.96]Console Brushy.
[266:05.00]Yeah, I got a Fez and a Brushy.
[266:18.89]I mean, unfortunately, the only game I played on here was Madden.
[266:23.35]This is the one that had all the games.
[266:33.91]Hmm.
[266:38.20]You have to go to the bathroom to play PC?
[266:39.92]That's where you are wrong, unfortunately for you.

[267:11.46]Let's go.
[267:44.99]Okay.

[268:46.98]Right here.
[268:50.99]Alright, install AC.
[268:51.81]Put it together.
[269:08.46]Gamers don't shower.
[269:13.61]Why is this to be a gamer room?
[269:17.49]There's more things you can do with a computer and a bunch of TVs.
[269:20.25]They're all about playing video games.
[269:27.04]You don't have a shower.
[269:34.08]One of these is not in.
[269:34.90]Hello?
[269:48.68]Uh... Can anybody hear me?
[269:51.44]That was weird.
[269:56.64]Damn, my computer fucked up.
[269:59.74]I'm back.
[270:02.74]That wasn't my internet.
[270:03.56]That was something... Something weird happened.
[270:12.18]Did the man cave live?
[270:13.56]Uh, I hope so.
[270:15.38]It should.
[270:19.68]It did, right?
[270:20.71]Wait, why does it look like that?
[270:27.99]It went into the toilet, the computer, while I'm sitting there.
[270:31.67]No, we're good.
[270:37.82]We're good.
[270:38.64]Let's see.

[271:17.95]Go to Pornhub and put a tab on every single one of these?
[271:23.43]And then just blast the AC?
[271:27.86]And how long are you going to do this for?
[271:33.02]I wouldn't put the AC down to, uh, 58.
[271:36.44]Okay, here we go.
[271:42.62]This looks like my porn room.
[271:55.01]Okay.
[271:57.99]Your porn room.
[272:03.31]The PC was too close to the fire.
[272:05.05]It burned out.
[272:08.29]Well, sorry about that.
[272:09.43]I probably wasn't going to be going for very much longer, but still don't like to abruptly end, but we're not done yet.
[272:19.64]So what am I going to do out here?
[272:24.44]More accessories.

[273:14.18]Stop.
[273:14.68]No.
[273:16.44]Why did I just say that like I was acting?
[273:18.32]No, stop.
[273:19.56]No, stop.
[273:24.23]Yeah, it's because I was going to say like porn DVDs.
[273:31.63]It's porn, man.
[273:54.20]I already have my fucking porn sanctuary.
[273:57.43]That's not even what this is, but that's what happens on this channel.
[274:02.09]You guys call it something, and that's what it becomes, and that's what it stays.
[274:19.65]Yeah, all six dis- look, you could- you could have Mario Kart on this one and then 4.5 Pornhub tabs.
[274:26.42]See?
[274:28.10]That's what the consoles are for.
[274:29.24]That room is done.
[274:43.16]Is the firewood?
[274:43.98]Alright, what am I- this is- make this look like shit.
[274:50.33]Yeah, this looks like shit.
[274:52.23]This is not the real house.
[274:54.85]What are these doing not open?
[275:01.31]Sell this house.
[275:04.61]What is this?
[275:05.65]Mount a shower?
[275:06.53]It's got 10 community subs from Retrospector.
[275:13.77]Thank you, Retro.
[275:15.95]For the 10 community subs.
[275:20.19]Rats to all you non-subbed humans that now have a sub.
[275:24.51]Now you can spam the emotes.
[275:25.75]I think I'll put these in here too.
[275:31.46]Because if you're going to come in here and you... What if you, like, get knocked into that and it explodes and shit?
[275:38.64]More booby traps.
[275:39.22]Booby traps.
[275:57.19]It's so hard to not hold it down.
[275:59.25]It's so hard to not hold down left trigger right now.
[276:01.82]I have to.
[276:02.14]I can't.
[276:02.62]I will burn it all.
[276:03.44]I have to leave.
[276:03.96]Okay.
[276:12.64]I got it out of my system.
[276:20.87]So now what?
[276:21.35]What do we do about this?
[276:24.17]What's the outside going to look like?
[276:27.41]invisible house right maybe just like a white or a brick five more subs from yes is online thanks to the five subs back to back sub drops mirrors
[276:59.38]You'd be the most annoying neighbor in history.
[277:03.76]Glare coming off of your house would be blinding.
[277:16.91]I don't think you'd be able to be... If the sun was shining brightly like it is right there, and you lived in this house, what would that do?
[277:27.98]He's doing the mirror house thing again.
[277:29.40]Oh, yeah.
[277:33.27]Shit, I can't do that again.
[277:35.03]I know, like, an invisible house is funny, but I don't want to sit here for an hour and 20 minutes doing this.
[277:47.16]It would catch on fire.
[277:48.20]Okay, let's do...
[277:59.44]one guy in chat saved the stream sure alright now let's do outdoor paint let's make it really just gray and boring maybe not maybe that maybe this is the fake part of the house we're gonna do biscuit just white how about just white
[278:30.08]How boring does this look?
[278:30.98]Do plaid?
[278:42.67]Mayo house.
[278:45.49]Did you guys know?
[278:46.43]I just recently learned this.
[278:48.21]Do you know that if something is called mayo, it doesn't actually have to be mayonnaise?
[278:54.84]To truly call your product mayonnaise and it's actually really mayonnaise.
[279:00.72]It has to have a specific set of ingredients.
[279:03.28]If you call something mayo, it could be pretty close, but it's not actually mayonnaise.
[279:09.36]If you see, like, oh, like, check out this one!
[279:11.55]Light mayo!
[279:12.47]That's not mayonnaise.
[279:13.59]It's legally not mayonnaise.
[279:16.55]It needs to be a certain amount of egg, yep.
[279:17.73]Certain amount of egg and a certain amount of oil.
[279:23.96]I did not know that.
[279:25.56]I was marketing tricked forever.
[279:27.42]I thought that mayo was just mayonnaise.
[279:47.96]cool random fact XD man oh come on that is like a kind of interesting fact come on man that's a kind that's pretty interesting I didn't know that as of like a few days ago that's interesting that's an interesting thing
[280:19.58]because I said it yeah if like Bill Nye was on camera right now talking about how mayonnaise and mayo are not the same thing and he had like a bunch of test tubes and those glasses on you'd be like oh cool but I say it and I'm a weirdo
[280:57.91]You don't have a science music.
[281:00.47]There is no music.
[281:01.21]This is birds.
[281:01.97]Let's change that.
[281:27.61]This house sucks.
[281:40.83]It really does.
[281:41.57]Doesn't even look like mayonnaise.
[281:43.51]It looks like a marshmallow.
[281:51.46]I don't really want to get on the scaffolding, so I think it's going to stay yellow.
[282:01.38]Mayonnaise isn't white.
[282:04.62]It is, but it's slightly, it's a little, it's like a, it's a kind of a cream color, isn't it?
[282:10.70]It's a little bit on the yellow side, isn't it?
[282:12.66]Not pure white.
[282:20.61]I need a scaffolding?
[282:22.39]Don't think I do.
[282:46.42]On to the other side.
[283:25.81]Is this a flame?
[283:50.68]You ever just stand outside and listen to birds and then actually sit there and go, I'll just sit in the background.
[283:57.32]This is so loud.
[283:58.46]And there's so many of them.
[284:12.78]It's not until you really sit there and listen for 10 seconds and go, holy shit.
[284:21.45]Is it Pac-Man dying sounds?
[284:30.36]It's a sorting algorithm.
[284:33.28]It's Galaga.
[284:35.62]It's Galaga.
[284:36.30]It is Galaga.
[284:40.14]Alright, what fucking weird bird is this?
[284:44.32]I need to find out what the Galaga bird is.
[284:46.56]Hold on.
[284:47.00]Pause everything.
[284:56.55]Turn him off.
[284:57.53]Where's the other one coming from?
[284:58.47]Okay.
[285:03.25]What is that?
[285:04.67]World's weirdest bird.
[285:07.12]The dusky grouse?
[285:10.56]No, what is it?
[285:12.20]The crested oro... Okay, this is apparently what the crested oro pendola sounds like.
[285:30.49]That's crazy.
[285:37.62]I can't believe that.
[285:38.62]That's unbelievable.
[285:39.70]Show bird.
[285:40.48]Show bird.
[285:42.58]Rested.
[285:43.00]Hold on.
[285:43.48]I gotta get a good photo.
[285:45.22]He's kind of bald.
[285:46.68]He's got a bald head.
[285:47.64]Look.
[286:06.53]That's what it looks like.
[286:14.69]I'm gonna put it on stream.
[286:17.82]This is what's making that noise.
[286:31.58]He's bald.
[286:38.95]Let's hear that one more time.
[286:49.55]Bird watching stream.
[286:51.45]Holy shit.
[286:53.42]What an incredible idea.
[286:54.68]I would go out there with a telephoto lens and try to capture birds and stuff.
[287:01.30]On image, I mean.
[287:10.43]I love that idea.
[287:14.23]You get bored really quick.
[287:16.33]Yeah.
[287:20.21]But I did build a birdhouse on stream.
[287:22.75]And how long was that stream?
[287:26.13]Like three hours, four hours, right?
[287:34.22]It was eight.
[287:37.82]It was eight hours?
[287:38.82]Okay, if I build a birdhouse for eight hours, I can watch birds for four.
[287:48.11]It was a full workday.
[287:49.25]To do one birdhouse?
[288:00.84]Yesterday.
[288:01.32]Not everything needs to be streamed.
[288:02.54]Today.
[288:02.96]Birdwatching is a go.
[288:08.09]Yeah, but I think that has to be streamed.
[288:09.53]I think that's something that's important to be streamed.
[288:15.09]Put a picture of that bird in the house.
[288:16.79]I don't even know what that bird is.
[288:26.24]I don't even know what kind of bird that is.
[288:29.59]I like my city painting thing.
[288:42.71]The problem with birdwatching, at least, I mean, around here, there's not birds like that around here.
[288:51.51]There's chickadees and, I mean, there are roadrunners out here, though.
[288:59.52]And those are awesome.
[289:02.62]So it would turn into a roadrunning watching stream.
[289:07.02]And ravens.
[289:07.80]There's, like, these big-ass crows and ravens out here.
[289:12.10]Like hawks and condors.
[289:15.28]There's a lot of cool birds out here.
[289:16.40]What am I talking about?
[289:16.98]Let's do it.
[289:33.91]30 hours in, he's still on the aquatine house.
[289:38.28]Not the aquatine house anymore.
[289:43.15]What's going on here?
[289:50.95]Would be a good stream.
[289:53.65]I'll do it.
[289:54.13]I'm looking forward to it.
[290:01.96]I have to find the right equipment to be able to have you guys able to watch.
[290:06.78]Some type of telephoto lens that I can get real close in or like a binocular thing that can be fed to a stream.
[290:13.70]Because if I go birdwatching, that means I have to do on-location, like IRL backpack type shit, right?
[290:25.89]How would I connect?
[290:26.79]I gotta connect like a lens to the... Sounds expensive.
[290:33.47]That's alright.
[290:36.15]Hey, if it's worth it to stream, you know the story.
[290:40.62]Told it a few times.
[290:51.27]Tell it again?
[290:51.79]I liquidated my retirement account to do the Jerma Rumble.
[290:59.22]That's what I mean.
[291:00.26]If it's worth doing, I'm going to do it.
[291:11.76]Watch bird videos instead.
[291:12.96]That's not the real thing.
[291:25.21]Cool.
[291:25.69]Alright, cool.
[291:26.27]You can connect the camera via USB to a laptop and use the webcam to see on a PC.
[291:34.50]No, wait, I'm not gonna aim the webcam and the laptop at a bird.
[291:39.18]I would need to use- I need to get, like, a camera.
[291:45.33]Holding it up and, like, pointing the laptop webcam.
[291:52.05]You would see nothing.
[291:53.01]It would be so pixelated and horrible.
[291:59.18]GoPros?
[292:00.36]Maybe.
[292:00.70]I feel like I would be the unlucky asshole that had a GoPro attached to his head and a camera.
[292:08.90]And I ended up getting chased by a rhino.
[292:12.10]And it would be just a horrible footage of me just running away screaming.
[292:15.66]How did that happen?
[292:28.91]This room's gotta change.
[292:30.21]This room's terrible.
[292:31.13]I don't know if rhinos... There's no rhinos native to Las Vegas.
[292:43.13]No, there aren't.
[292:43.81]I don't know.
[292:45.29]Maybe.
[292:48.15]Who knows?
[292:51.37]Hey, if Bigfoot apparently still exists and no one's been able to see him, that doesn't mean he can't kill you.
[293:01.94]They've been looking for him for a long time, and he still kills people in the woods.
[293:14.93]Hmm.
[293:15.71]Let's go in cabinets.
[293:35.00]I like.
[293:41.18]Cabinet teleporter.
[293:43.33]Not symmetrical.
[293:44.19]Who cares?
[293:44.91]Table.
[293:49.13]Like a little runner.
[293:49.85]Like a runner table.
[293:54.29]One of these.
[293:55.79]One of these.
[293:58.89]One of these.
[293:59.19]I just thought of tuna sandwich.
[294:00.93]Tuna salad.
[294:01.55]And I wanted one now.
[294:02.81]Like right now.
[294:07.04]Something about the mayonnaise shit from earlier.
[294:08.82]How big is this?
[294:15.49]It's way too big.
[294:21.07]Did I make a trail of porn magazines into the room?
[294:41.68]Who am I trying to catch by the way with this?
[295:04.69]No, this room now has a completely different context that I don't want any.
[295:08.95]I don't want this to be just like the weird porn room in the basement of your house.
[295:16.10]It's hidden down here.
[295:17.02]It was supposed to be my dream house, but it's actually just the hidden, like, pornographic theater.
[295:26.90]Get rid of all these.
[295:28.68]I'm getting rid of the context.
[295:40.17]It's your shame room?
[295:54.50]You can never find them all.
[295:58.67]I'm gonna go through all this.
[295:59.83]Get rid of all of them.
[296:01.51]Alright.
[296:02.47]It's over.
[296:03.45]No more of that.
[296:04.11]No more porn magazines.
[296:05.33]And then a month later.
[296:06.75]Jeremy, what's this?
[296:08.58]No, no, no!
[296:09.71]I got rid of all of them!
[296:11.63]It can't be!
[296:18.71]No, this room is now... No!
[296:21.27]This is my... This is where I come play games.
[296:28.84]And this is food over here.
[296:31.00]This is food.
[296:31.54]This is tuna, salad, peanut butter...
[296:35.86]Some kind of yogurt and nuts.
[296:42.20]This is my domain down here.
[296:44.32]This is where I go to... Secret fucking, like, porn addict part of your house.
[296:58.23]This is... You guys have effectively... This has ruined my dream house.
[297:13.55]Now if somebody's upstairs wow that's gonna be really really odd isn't it?
[297:24.45]What the hell do I hear so loud coming through this house somewhere?
[297:29.14]Is this?
[297:42.44]Make it a bible study room, quick.
[297:46.50]You'll be able to hear this at the ground level at the street.
[297:57.67]Where is it?
[298:04.50]Is it webcam?
[298:12.77]There's a guy on Facetime!
[298:19.19]It's a Kinect!
[298:37.00]No, I don't want to put webcams all over the room.
[298:41.24]That makes this fucking weird.
[298:45.25]Why would I have webcams all over my fucking room like this?
[298:48.25]Is this my security system?
[299:01.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[299:11.87]Imagine somebody.
[299:25.48]Imagine somebody streaming from their toilet, but they're on the computer.
[299:37.50]That's, that's so fucked up.
[299:46.73]Diablo II stream, part 2.
[299:48.37]Oh, don't even.
[299:51.39]Okay.
[299:52.51]I'm over that.
[299:54.53]What was I looking for?
[299:55.43]Right, right, right.
[299:59.19]Sound dampening for when I watch fucking Infinity War at max volume.
[300:06.30]Was it proofing?
[300:07.18]Soundproof?
[300:16.80]Okay, if somebody was in this room and they were watching Infinity War at max volume... Here we go!
[300:21.88]I'm gonna watch Infinity War at max volume!
[300:24.55]I'll talk to you later!
[300:26.07]Don't you feel like that they'd turn it on and you would hear like...
[300:31.97]You'd be like, holy shit, and you'd get out of the house.
[300:33.71]You'd come back down here, like, three months later.
[300:37.18]Hey, I haven't heard from him in a while.
[300:39.06]Is he, is he alright?
[300:40.14]You open this up, it's just a skeleton on the bed.
[300:43.46]It killed him.
[300:44.14]It killed this motherfucker.
[301:00.40]Where is it?
[301:09.71]Is he streaming from bed?
[301:11.05]Okay, so where is this?
[301:28.08]Where the... Hold on.
[301:30.10]First of all, this is what I'm looking for.
[301:31.66]This is starting to derail.
[301:34.56]This is derailing hard.
[301:48.00]I can't put them close together?
[301:53.47]Cover the entire wall.
[301:56.97]So I can have my max volume Infinity Ward death chamber?
[302:00.72]100 by 100.
[302:03.42]We want more than that.
[302:21.71]I can't even fit anymore on the wall.
[302:23.43]I made the room too cool.
[302:53.89]I can't fit anymore.
[303:00.26]It's uneven.
[303:00.86]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[303:02.94]Uneven.
[303:03.40]Kill it.
[303:03.88]Stop.
[303:04.92]I got it.
[303:10.48]Where is it?
[303:11.74]Where is it?
[303:18.57]What is this?
[303:20.73]What is this?
[303:29.90]A kissing toilet?
[303:31.16]Stop distracting me.
[303:55.21]I'm trying to get to a very specific place.
[304:01.99]Not you.
[304:03.64]Game.
[304:24.43]Best dad trophy.
[304:32.63]I got trophies everywhere.
[304:36.91]I got like Emmys.
[304:46.97]Guitar?
[304:48.33]Where is it?
[304:48.91]Where is it?
[304:49.35]Where is it?
[304:49.73]Where is it?
[304:50.11]Where is it?
[305:00.10]Come on!
[305:01.00]Come on!
[305:02.53]No, why?
[305:04.01]This is supposed to be him.
[305:11.96]He can't be placed.
[305:46.24]No, I don't like that.
[305:51.20]Okay.
[305:55.80]What was I doing?
[305:58.49]Get rid of that too.
[305:59.19]I don't want that in here.
[306:08.19]Okay, hold on.
[306:09.05]This is like what I imagined hearing from upstairs.
[306:15.95]Hold on a second.
[306:17.13]I gotta get the right thing here.
[306:24.12]Okay, hold on.
[306:25.08]Let's get the right thing.
[306:29.06]Uh oh.
[306:30.42]Okay.
[306:38.70]This needs to be dropped a little bit.
[306:39.98]Get that down.
[306:40.62]Okay.
[306:40.78]Okay.
[306:44.69]So far so good.
[306:47.61]Don't want any real echo at all.
[306:51.11]Here we go.
[306:51.91]Okay.
[306:54.05]Okay.
[306:54.79]That looks... Alright.
[306:57.39]There we go.
[307:01.29]This is what it's like to live above or below or next to somebody that just has their shit way too fucking goddamn loud.
[307:14.96]Alright, turn it on.
[307:24.28]I'll be up here.
[307:58.41]fucking god damn it just trying to cook fucking dinner
[308:12.35]Kids, it's time for dinner soon.
[308:13.93]This is Kim's point of view.
[308:25.99]But then you go downstairs and he's just...
[308:39.95]You would never be safe.
[308:44.33]If there was a room like this, you would never be safe.
[308:46.89]You wouldn't be safe anywhere in this house.
[308:48.97]This could be three levels.
[308:50.48]It wouldn't matter.
[308:59.96]You produced a hit single.
[309:01.22]How does it feel to be famous?
[309:06.70]Um, when?
[309:12.71]Put Thanos on.
[309:20.53]Oh, hey, let's see what he's watching.
[309:22.61]Let's get down there and get a little bit closer.
[309:24.17]Hold on.
[309:31.88]Hold on.
[309:50.31]destiny arrives all the same and it's here I am here and the thing about all that
[310:18.52]The snap of my fingers.
[310:31.15]I could make the whole world turn to shit.
[310:38.85]What are you watching?
[310:41.19]We're still on.
[310:41.89]Thanos turns and looks right in the camera.
[310:52.30]Hey, what are you watching?
[310:53.58]Ooh, sounds spooky.
[311:10.32]Freddy Krueger?
[311:11.24]Freddy!
[311:11.92]Freddy!
[311:12.72]Freddy Krueger!
[311:14.14]Oh, wow!
[311:15.46]It looks like I can see into your nightmares, can't I?
[311:19.34]Why don't you come down here, and I'll just fuck you up.
[311:28.15]Oh, you can wake up soon, can't you?
[311:31.05]But not on my watch.
[311:32.63]Slash, motherfucker!
[311:34.31]Slash!
[311:37.93]I think I can
[311:40.62]I could do it.
[311:41.02]That's Mr. Satan.
[311:43.82]It's the same person.
[311:47.76]Mr. Satan is Freddy Krueger.
[311:49.38]It's the same voice.
[311:50.60]Well, I think that me and Goku are gonna find ourselves in trouble here.
[311:54.72]Look out for Majin Buu.
[311:57.40]Hey, motherfucker.
[311:58.80]I'm gonna come over there and I'm gonna slash your face in this nightmare.
[312:02.66]Don't tell Goku that I'll slash your face in your dreams.
[312:06.56]Every voice is the same.
[312:07.34]There's only like eight voices.
[312:19.37]Put Steve Buscemi across all six screens.
[312:29.58]Do a 5G tower.
[312:31.30]No, we're not reverting back to 5G tower.
[312:38.65]That's a wrestling character.
[312:40.15]Yes, it is.
[312:41.47]And when I come down to the ring, you better believe, oh, that I will slash that motherfucker in his dreams inside of the ring, Goku.
[312:51.66]And then when Majin Buu scoop slams me down into the bathtub part of the blood coming out of me, I will be able to fly away and don't tell anybody, Goku, that I will never see the light of day again.
[313:13.33]I'm drunk.
[313:13.83]You're going to make me throw up.
[313:20.72]What time is it?
[313:25.11]Southern Preacher.
[313:27.77]Well, I'll tell you something, goat.
[313:30.59]Last time that I was at this sermon, we told the Lord that he was going to come down to that ring.
[313:37.59]And when he came down to that ring, Goku, we were going to cast out Satan and slash him in his nightmare and then drag him to...
[314:04.93]Goofy?
[314:07.61]Well, I'll tell you something, Mickey.
[314:09.91]We have to be careful if Donald is in a lot of trouble down in that ring.
[314:15.44]I need to get down to that ring.
[314:20.38]Well, Mickey, I...
[314:26.62]Well, Mickey, Donald seems like he's in a little bit of trouble.
[314:30.58]Donald, that ring, whoa!
[314:32.52]We gotta get in there, and I'm gonna tell you another thing about the Democrats.
[314:35.99]They're coming at us.
[314:36.71]They're gonna take us on.
[314:37.61]They're gonna come down there into the ring, and I'm gonna make them all stop.
[314:39.75]I'm gonna get them, I'm gonna get into a car, and I'm gonna drive over there, and we're gonna stop them.
[314:42.85]That's the best part.
[314:43.63]And then we're gonna slash them in their nightmares, and they're gonna bring them down to hell, too, where they belong.
[314:48.46]Come on down to the ring and face me.
[314:50.54]You won't, Goku.
[314:51.84]I know you won't.
[314:53.06]And if you show your face here again, you God-fearing bastard, I will drag you out of here.
[315:01.89]Never show your face in my castle again, which is a church.
[315:06.86]I know I just said castle.
[315:08.58]You think I give a shit, Goku?
[315:20.89]Oh, hey Jimmy, I just want to let you know that Donald's in a lot of trouble over there.
[315:25.49]We have to go find Sora, and then we gotta drag him down.
[315:28.75]Alright, no, no, no, no, I'm moving on, we're done.
[315:35.91]Oh, hey Jimmy, I just want to let you know that those Democrats, they're coming for us, they're gonna... That's just Twitch chat.
[315:54.05]It is.
[315:55.85]It is.
[316:01.94]Yeah.
[316:05.68]Oh, hey, Jimmy.
[316:07.06]I just want to tell you that Arthur... Jimmy, what I meant to say, Arthur, is get him to hell.
[316:19.61]Hey, Jim.
[316:20.47]Hey, Arthur.
[316:27.83]I have a plan to cast Satan out of my halls.
[316:34.23]That plan needs to be done right, Arthur.
[316:39.69]You can't just rob an entire gold van without me and without including me.
[316:48.56]And you didn't even include Goku or Vegeta.
[316:55.73]How can you expect us to care about that Sora?
[317:12.95]It's infinite.
[317:20.19]Stop.
[317:20.79]Please stop.
[317:21.53]Okay.
[317:25.56]You can't do Bernie here.
[317:27.20]Let me tell you.
[317:28.24]There is... No, you cannot.
[317:30.48]Don't even... Don't interrupt me.
[317:32.22]No, that's not Bernie.
[317:43.47]Personality core in portal.
[317:51.86]I've just been walking in a circle.
[317:55.85]Venom, Bernie?
[318:07.71]What we're gonna do is we're gonna break up the banks.
[318:10.81]We don't need them.
[318:11.73]There's no reason to have a bank.
[318:13.56]Bernie, I agree completely with you.
[318:17.44]I know.
[318:17.94]I know.
[318:18.46]I know Bernie, Venom.
[318:20.86]What we also should do is we should make socialized healthcare, too.
[318:25.22]Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[318:27.66]You can stay as long as you want.
[318:29.34]I don't know why I would be afraid of you.
[318:31.58]There's no reason why I would be afraid of you.
[318:34.80]There's no reason why I would be afraid of you.
[318:37.62]I think we agree on most things.
[318:39.68]We agree on everything, it seems.
[318:45.76]When can I eat somebody?
[318:48.81]Not doing that.
[318:49.65]We're not doing that.
[319:03.36]Do Walter White.
[319:05.10]Jesse.
[319:08.30]Jesse.
[319:09.38]We've got to... Go, go.
[319:27.04]Do Larry David.
[319:27.98]No, we're done with this.
[319:31.98]I am done.
[319:33.50]I am not going to do this again ever again in my life.
[319:41.34]And you know what else?
[319:46.27]Oh, every every single one.
[319:54.93]Oh, hey, Jimmy.
[319:59.76]I gotta rip this thing out.
[320:00.58]I gotta tear this thing out.
[320:01.42]This is not gonna stop.
[320:09.05]Um... Okay.
[320:11.53]So what do we do now?
[320:25.32]Rip to anybody that was asleep.
[320:29.18]I keep opening the same door.
[320:31.18]Is that end of the stream?
[320:33.81]Is that how this ends?
[320:34.73]I think that's how this just ends today.
[320:40.99]It's been about six hours.
[320:50.70]What did I start at?
[320:51.18]10.15?
[320:51.20]10.30? 10.30?
[320:56.65]You still have two empty rooms.
[320:57.77]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[321:00.18]Let's finish this.
[321:12.35]It's been 45 minutes.
[321:13.99]I think of just what we were just doing.
[321:18.09]So that's probably accurate.
[321:31.84]I can't even look at this room anymore.
[321:41.51]I can't even look at that room anymore.
[321:43.73]I can't look at this room anymore.
[321:44.87]It has a completely different fucked up context for me now.
[321:47.33]I'm about to burn it.
[321:59.66]I want something here.
[322:07.23]Ooh.
[322:08.57]Ooh.
[322:11.56]Ooh.
[322:13.82]Very, very cool.
[322:14.96]Nice.
[322:54.07]Alright, before it saves.
[322:56.47]Wait, it permanently saves everything.
[322:59.75]No, it doesn't.
[323:00.52]No, it doesn't.
[323:00.86]No, it doesn't.
[323:01.20]No, it doesn't.
[323:02.40]Nope!
[323:04.26]Shift-enter.
[323:16.39]I had to burn that room, though.
[323:17.35]I had to get it out of me.
[323:19.49]That room was Satanic.
[323:21.35]I had to get rid of it.
[323:28.10]Okay, let's go... So, let's go over what's going to happen over the next few days.
[323:39.24]So, I am not going to be live until Monday.
[323:42.17]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[323:45.19]We're probably going to start either Custom Robo or Desperados 3.
[323:57.11]He's leaving us.
[324:01.52]Didn't save?
[324:02.04]I don't think so.
[324:08.72]When's the last time it did save, though?
[324:10.42]That's a great question.
[324:13.22]I don't think it really matters, considering we didn't do anything for about the last 32 straight minutes.
[324:20.20]So there's no improvements or problems.
[324:28.60]I have... I still have the 3DO.
[324:31.45]I gotta pull that out.
[324:32.37]There's at least three or four games on the 3DO that we have to play.
[324:52.02]Only custom robo matters.
[324:58.15]Yeah, we're good.
[324:58.55]Look.
[324:58.73]Everything looks in order.
[325:01.79]Yeah, I remember that.
[325:02.49]I remember this.
[325:03.49]Yep.
[325:07.42]Everything seems to be in order.
[325:08.52]Heralds are still here.
[325:14.30]Everything's still here.
[325:15.00]Aim did not save.
[325:17.60]Look at that, guys.
[325:18.26]I told you.
[325:18.68]We're good.
[325:28.60]His trophies are gone.
[325:29.72]No, they are not.
[325:36.18]Do it again.
[325:37.14]No, I'm not going to risk that.
[325:45.16]What is this?
[325:49.59]What is that?
[325:50.05]Why is there a toilet on top of the toilet?
[325:59.11]That's weird.
[326:02.07]Now sell the house.
[326:05.11]Let's see what we can get for it.
[326:09.13]If I can't get something crazy, I bought the house for $180,000.
[326:11.95]Put it on auction.
[326:17.50]I'll keep it, but if it's a lot of money, we'll see.
[326:21.72]I'm in the hole.
[326:22.14]If it's not at least $280,000, I'm not doing it.
[326:33.05]No.
[326:35.51]Nah.
[326:37.99]Could we find five grand?
[326:39.52]Don't care.
[326:40.68]Look at my bank accounts.
[326:41.56]Fucking 360, man.
[326:42.66]I got plenty of money.
[326:51.24]Porn room.
[326:53.60]Alright, that's gonna be the end.
[326:56.42]This is like a perfect, like, just about, like, what, six hours or so?
[327:02.53]Hold on, let me see.
[327:03.41]It's been like five or six hours.
[327:05.31]I'm just deletes when I play this game.
[327:15.56]Where's my videos tab?
[327:16.86]How long has it been?
[327:29.33]There's a videos tab.
[327:33.05]Let me check and see how long the last one was.
[327:35.21]Just curious.
[327:42.35]Four hours?
[327:42.87]Five hours?
[327:45.51]Four hours and 31 minutes.
[327:46.53]There you go.
[327:48.55]Yeah, that's exactly where I wanted to stop.
[327:52.05]Sorry for the, uh, crash.
[327:53.21]It's gonna screw up a lot of the credits stuff because when you lose stream, you cut everything else out.
[328:00.37]So that's gonna be dead.
[328:02.63]Unfortunately.
[328:03.35]And I did fix it too.
[328:07.07]I did.
[328:07.29]Remember I told you guys I was gonna fix it the next time you saw me?
[328:10.19]I did.
[328:11.19]But the game, everything, my computer just got fucked up.
[328:14.42]So it's all gone.
[328:17.20]I'm sorry about that.
[328:18.32]I know that people like to watch the credits.
[328:26.63]Rigged.
[328:27.93]I know.
[328:31.91]He had to pull the plug to hide the fact that he didn't fix it.
[328:36.60]Now, I'll see you guys on Monday.
[328:37.76]We're going to do either Desperados 3 or Custom Robo.
[328:40.54]Whatever I feel like playing.
[328:46.40]Raid.
[328:46.76]Raid.
[328:47.02]Raid Chuck E. Cheese.
[328:48.00]Hold on.
[328:48.22]Chuck E. Cheese is... No.
[328:57.20]Isn't Chuck E. Cheese bankrupt?
[328:59.28]Didn't they go out of business?
[329:00.12]Or aren't they going out of business?
[329:01.16]Hold on.
[329:02.12]This is real.
[329:04.10]Chuck E. Cheese.
[329:06.04]Isn't it going out of business?
[329:09.12]It's not?
[329:09.71]Yeah, didn't they file a chapter 11?
[329:10.95]They're not streaming anymore.
[329:27.70]Oh, well.
[329:28.12]I'll see you guys Monday.
[329:30.50]Thanks for watching as always.
[329:33.48]House Flipper, I think we're probably done with House Flipper for now.
[329:39.85]I'll wait for some more DLC.
[329:41.09]It's one of my favorite games.
[329:52.12]It's always a blast.
[329:54.34]Something interesting always seems to happen.
[329:56.80]That's what happens.
[329:57.24]You get to build your own little house.
[329:58.38]But I'll see you Monday.
[330:01.37]Take care, everybody.
[330:03.33]I'm going to send you to... I'm going to send you to Kiwo.
[330:06.23]It's been a while since we have said hello to Kiwo.
[330:10.62]It's been probably like six months or something.
[330:21.38]Have a good rest of your night.
[330:24.38]See you soon.
[330:25.48]See you Monday.
[330:28.97]End.
[330:30.61]Goodbye.
[330:32.07]We don't even need this screen, unfortunately.
[330:37.99]Let's get the raid going.
[330:43.25]I will do the end screen, though.
[330:45.22]Because the credits have messed up.
[330:47.30]Thank you so many people subscribed to this channel.
[330:49.74]It's ridiculous.
[330:51.24]I don't even know what to say besides thanks.
[330:53.42]It's shocking to know that there's that many people that want to give me money a month.
[330:57.86]I seriously still can't believe it.
[331:01.19]But we'll see you soon.
[331:01.75]Take care, guys.
[331:06.39]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[331:09.01]And goodbye.
[331:14.77]Thank you.
[331:49.65]you
