[ve:61.1.100]

[00:02.60]But we will finish this tonight.
[00:05.02]I'm going to move over to here and see if they are ready.
[00:08.35]Let's give them a call.
[00:10.61]It looks like Vinny just went live.
[00:17.14]Hulk, I think, is making a... Here's the thing about the Castle Crashers update.
[00:22.69]You can make a character.
[00:24.57]You open up Photoshop with the file inside of the directory, and you can just edit a fake... Not a fake, a real character.
[00:34.44]I opened it, realized it was kind of a commitment, and I was like, okay, I'm going to take a while to make stuff.
[00:42.02]So I just downloaded five to 10 weird ones and we'll see how they are.
[00:53.37]I'm going to call them.
[01:05.09]Hey.
[01:05.67]Hey.
[01:08.96]What's happening, man?
[01:11.90]I'm glad to see that that game even as a child like as a child I felt like a failure but as an adult I know that the odds were stacked against me and I was destined to die it looks like I'm at the end of the game but I'll finish it later
[01:29.15]It's still fun, though, for an NES game.
[01:31.77]I think it holds up pretty well.
[01:34.32]I mean, it's fun when you can rewind time in the underwater death maze.
[01:39.39]The timed underwater hitbox registration, like, wall death... No.
[01:46.96]I don't know how... I feel like I remember when I was younger...
[01:51.95]I wasn't even getting mad at the game.
[01:53.87]I was just, I must be doing something wrong.
[01:56.21]I need to play it a little bit better.
[01:57.89]You know, like as an adult, I feel like vindicated.
[02:00.68]Yeah.
[02:01.48]Oh, you weren't dumb.
[02:03.04]You are now, but.
[02:05.88]That's fine.
[02:06.66]So Castle Crashers.
[02:09.35]I, let me just open it.
[02:12.57]Dude, this is, I actually really like this thing here.
[02:15.59]It's kind of cool because I want to go look at this a little bit more while we have time.
[02:24.41]What other music do they have?
[02:26.06]I never played Castle Crashers.
[02:29.74]Are you serious?
[02:31.90]No, I'm lying to you.
[02:33.80]That's kind of crazy.
[02:34.66]That was the beat-em-up of the, like, 2010s.
[02:38.11]I have, like, some playtime in it, but I feel like I did, like, the first level and I was like, nah, and I closed it.
[02:44.29]I want to see the ads.
[02:51.72]Comic books.
[02:53.84]Can you read them?
[02:54.92]No way.
[02:56.77]What?
[02:58.15]Can you read the comics?
[02:59.43]How would they do this?
[03:00.15]I think just covers.
[03:06.60]That's still cool though.
[03:14.55]Show controls.
[03:21.16]I think it's just the covers.
[03:29.52]That's still cool though.
[03:38.37]All of them?
[03:39.31]What is this one?
[03:40.15]Were you like a Ninja Turtles comic book fan or were you just the shows or the games?
[03:49.96]I was not a very big Ninja Turtles fan.
[03:52.23]At all?
[03:52.83]Damn.
[03:55.67]Didn't play, didn't care about Ninja Turtles, didn't play Castle Crashers.
[03:59.38]I know, like, you're setting me up to just be that guy right now.
[04:02.72]The hell did you do?
[04:03.70]Aw, that's the animated shows.
[04:07.97]I think that childhood Ninja Turtle energy was taken up by Power Rangers for me.
[04:15.30]Power Rangers was a good one too, though.
[04:17.40]For a second, I thought you could watch whole seasons of these shows.
[04:30.47]That's cool.
[04:36.74]Dude, that lower right is iconic.
[04:48.61]So am I understanding that we're all going to not know what anyone is talking about when they say like fight George Bush and we're all going to have different characters?
[04:58.66]I think it's just our avatars.
[05:02.95]Unless somebody's doing something wacky in the background.
[05:04.82]No, I think as you scroll down on the... It has a base character type, and there's, like, models for every character that you can get, like, one for all the monsters.
[05:18.05]I mean, I don't... I didn't... I only got the ones for my character, I think.
[05:24.82]Yo!
[05:25.60]Hey!
[05:27.67]The unction has begun-tion.
[05:29.67]How are you guys?
[05:30.85]What's happening?
[05:32.69]Hello, Jorma.
[05:34.63]Hello, Star.
[05:35.91]Hello.
[05:37.54]So for a future debate, I have to ask you guys something.
[05:41.30]This is important before we get it started with anything.
[05:44.97]I've been fighting my chat on this for the better half of a couple of weeks and Star's chat for the last three days.
[05:54.30]What Ninja Turtle are the four of us?
[05:57.97]Say who you think you are out loud right now.
[06:01.48]The green one.
[06:03.54]Okay.
[06:05.14]Oh, wait.
[06:05.56]Okay.
[06:06.04]For a second, I was like, who's green?
[06:10.01]I'll just be Donatello if that's cool.
[06:13.10]That fixes all of our problems, Vinny.
[06:15.88]Great.
[06:17.04]You solved it.
[06:18.48]You just solved every issue because everyone was trying to figure out if you were Leonardo or you were Donatello.
[06:23.85]And it was a huge problem.
[06:25.78]It's fine.
[06:26.74]Okay.
[06:27.98]I like Donatello.
[06:28.94]He's alright.
[06:31.77]They eat pizza.
[06:33.21]They're from New York.
[06:34.39]They're turtles.
[06:35.05]That's me.
[06:36.61]So I could be any one of them.
[06:37.73]But I like Donatello.
[06:39.02]I think he's cool.
[06:41.34]Well, there you go.
[06:43.52]Poke, we're getting Michelangelo for you.
[06:46.36]Okay.
[06:53.69]There's no Vincenzo, right?
[06:58.08]Like...
[06:59.86]like from the turtles was there like a side character I know they're all renaissance guys but like was there an italian like named vincenzo the turtle okay uh it's just like that the the immediate like this conversation is like it's just over we like we can just move on kind of okay as that was amazing
[07:19.81]I was expecting like a debate.
[07:23.10]It's just like, yeah, I'm Donatello.
[07:24.50]Yeah, okay, I don't care.
[07:25.44]This is fun.
[07:26.30]Let's play Castle Crashers.
[07:28.86]Yeah, pretty much.
[07:30.41]I was going to say, do you want to talk about Ronald McDonald now or later?
[07:34.17]Like while we're playing the game?
[07:35.53]I mean, I'm always here to talk about Ronald.
[07:40.70]Alright, let's jump into Castle and then we'll talk about Ronald.
[07:43.69]It's actually true.
[07:44.29]I called him up at four in the morning one night and we talked about Ronald.
[07:47.97]Scoops.
[07:50.08]was it really was a nice conversation he came out of a dead sleep and was like oh I'm always here man that's I like a guy like that you know like that's a good friend yeah but then then I tried to change the topic and he had to go when you wake up from a cold sweat and like you have like a serious like nightmare right and you want to just talk about like Ronald was a homie that's a good thing yeah
[08:19.90]So did you guys, Pogue, did you make a character?
[08:22.51]Did you make somebody?
[08:23.91]Yeah, I just made it right now.
[08:25.57]I'm just curious.
[08:27.37]I can't wait.
[08:28.44]I cannot wait.
[08:30.34]I didn't have a chance to make my own character, but I found a couple good ones.
[08:35.33]Here's what you should do.
[08:36.09]How about we... You guys should just link the picture to your community right now and let them make you a character in five minutes.
[08:44.94]It's actually pretty easy.
[08:46.99]Because I downloaded a bunch of random ones from the workshop.
[08:49.87]I don't know if... Some of them are... Oh, we want fresh mode, right?
[08:56.78]Yeah, fresh mode.
[08:59.90]Should I show the ones that I have, or should it be a surprise?
[09:10.70]I just made mine, so I'm going to use mine, right?
[09:13.88]Does that work?
[09:15.52]I think we should be able to do it.
[09:17.94]yeah yeah it should just work what's um back off barbarian game mode I bet there's already jermaOn the thing uh I have one there is I have two actually of Jerm is it wait can I yeah there's a there's a bunch of dude one of them one of them there's two pages dude one of them says the one that I got says hey sorry guys this one's broken I like I'm gonna have to like reupload it because this one's messed up and that's the one I got
[09:47.80]There's a Vinny in there too.
[09:48.97]There is a Vinesauce in there.
[09:50.89]I did get that one, yeah.
[09:53.11]So play online.
[09:55.15]I do want to see, maybe, you know what?
[09:57.71]If any chat member wants to use a real photo of me, if anyone's like really bored during the stream, just, you know, let me know.
[10:05.08]Let me know.
[10:05.50]Otherwise, here's my characters.
[10:06.76]But let me get these guys in here.
[10:09.74]So are we doing the regular game mode, I imagine, right?
[10:13.77]Regular game mode.
[10:14.61]I'm going to throw you guys an invite.
[10:18.47]Wait.
[10:21.19]Who here has not played this game ever?
[10:24.13]Me.
[10:25.41]Oh, I think you're going to like it, Ster.
[10:26.90]I love this game.
[10:27.58]You're going to love it.
[10:28.12]Say Towerborn.
[10:30.70]Wait, is it?
[10:32.24]Kind of, right?
[10:33.36]Yeah, kind of.
[10:35.47]I've played beat-em-ups before, but Castle Crashers, their heads are too big.
[10:41.69]That is a turn-off.
[10:42.51]I agree.
[10:43.19]It scared me.
[10:45.87]Okay, I'm coming in.
[10:46.89]Is there a room code that I don't want to show, or can I show the screen?
[10:50.38]It seems like it's okay.
[10:51.86]Before you choose your character, though, let's all hop in.
[10:56.51]Hold on, hold on.
[10:57.31]I'm saving my character right now.
[11:00.29]Alright.
[11:03.38]Yeah, I played this a lot back on the Xbox 360.
[11:06.75]and uh I loved this game so I'm excited to jump back in there's like a the DLC adds like you know new graphics and some new stuff but there's like some characters some that people uploaded that don't count as playable characters oh so it's kind of weird I don't know how that works I think it might just be background npcs or bosses or something but we'll see because I think you can only have three custom characters added to each save slot I think that's what it looked like
[11:36.72]I clicked... I downloaded a bunch.
[11:38.38]I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[11:40.04]Do you go to manage?
[11:40.54]Do I have to wait for... Do I have to wait for it to be, uh... It says awaiting analysis by our automated content team.
[11:47.73]Oh, it's checking for penises.
[11:49.49]Oh, is it because it thinks you have something naughty?
[11:52.60]Might.
[11:53.54]Yeah.
[11:54.38]How come I can't use my controller?
[11:56.30]Half of us have one.
[11:59.53]Mine works.
[12:01.41]Mine works too.
[12:02.11]Can you move up and down?
[12:07.36]I cannot switch character right now.
[12:11.41]My buttons don't do anything.
[12:12.65]Yo.
[12:12.73]What the hell was that?
[12:18.03]I think?
[12:19.64]What was that noise?
[12:21.26]Oh.
[12:21.86]What?
[12:21.98]You guys heard something?
[12:23.24]Yeah.
[12:23.60]Oh, God.
[12:24.10]My bad.
[12:27.04]I mean, I have an Xbox controller plugged in.
[12:29.55]That's weird.
[12:33.09]Unplug, replug?
[12:34.69]I've tried it a couple times.
[12:37.03]controller setting on steam input enable steam input okay why was that not on by default that didn't work if you alt tab it can break the controller what weird what's I put in wait is my controller broken oh god my controller broke too what about my PS5 controller does that work what the hell is that PS5 broke
[13:05.70]Oh wait, why am I two people?
[13:08.58]What the f- Shit, hold on.
[13:12.17]What is going on?
[13:14.45]Wait, my shit's- Wait, am I approved?
[13:19.64]It's approved, I think.
[13:22.38]How do you actually choose to use it in the game?
[13:25.45]Oh, Jesus.
[13:27.01]You have to go to manage first.
[13:28.61]No, okay, I'm in the game as controller and as keyboard.
[13:35.18]You can't alt tab.
[13:36.62]Okay, so we got confirmed can't alt tab.
[13:39.14]I'm going to exit and we'll try this again.
[13:41.37]But don't alt tab.
[13:42.85]Okay, don't alt tab ever.
[13:45.45]Do I have to do something extra from the skins?
[13:48.76]Yeah, go to manage.
[13:52.20]Which one of these is manage?
[13:59.72]That's a good question.
[14:02.38]Oh fuck, I leaked it.
[14:04.18]I leaked everything.
[14:05.65]It's okay.
[14:06.27]You gotta invite me.
[14:09.27]I'll invite you in a second.
[14:10.25]I'm using controller.
[14:12.76]Oh, you know what?
[14:13.70]I... I can't invite because I don't have the overlay.
[14:20.51]Okay, I can... Can I invite now?
[14:26.13]Maybe.
[14:26.55]Yeah, invite.
[14:27.42]Let me see.
[14:28.20]Shit.
[14:30.82]So, Ster, you have to go to the thing and then go to manage.
[14:35.72]Go to where it says custom characters.
[14:37.10]Go to the thing?
[14:38.47]Custom paint characters.
[14:40.43]What does it say that?
[14:41.93]I don't know.
[14:42.79]Open your stream.
[14:44.03]What are you looking at?
[14:45.29]I'm not looking at anything.
[14:47.86]Why is it unplugging all my stuff?
[14:49.34]Because I invited you to the game.
[14:52.84]Your controller is still not working.
[14:55.03]My controller works now.
[14:56.41]Okay, so I'm at the thing.
[14:58.63]Painter boss Paradise.
[15:00.72]and then go to Manager and go in there and enable your characters.
[15:12.70]Okay.
[15:13.94]You got him?
[15:17.12]Yes.
[15:17.86]Should I play as the Roblox guy?
[15:27.60]I probably should have restarted my controller works.
[15:31.42]Hold on.
[15:33.73]Uh-oh.
[15:35.87]Okay, I only have access to me and my Roblox guy.
[15:46.57]Oh, okay.
[15:47.03]You have to enable... I downloaded a whole bunch of them for, like, the enemies.
[15:52.13]You still have to enable all those.
[15:54.36]Oh, okay.
[15:57.79]But the ones that are characters then you choose which slot they are.
[16:05.64]So you go to manage and then in the manage screen you have to like you click on a character and it'll say what slot do you want to put this on?
[16:11.89]Just say one.
[16:14.65]And then when you can put I think up to two or three people on one slot.
[16:19.84]Can I make the game have PlayStation controls not Xbox?
[16:24.22]know what I'm saying yeah the button inputs I don't know if you can I know it's annoying it should be an option in every game uh Jerma there's two of you there's two of me again yeah gone fishing one and two oh what the dude okay there we go can I get an invite I got it I will invite you you can join yourself you probably just join off me
[16:56.48]I just want to see how weird this one is.
[16:59.95]You know what?
[17:00.57]I'm going to be SirBabe.
[17:01.41]Do you have to download my skin for me to see it?
[17:04.41]I think we do.
[17:05.10]We should just have it.
[17:06.00]I think we just have it.
[17:07.22]No, we can see everyone else's.
[17:09.48]Yes.
[17:10.99]Can you guys see this?
[17:12.05]Yeah, I can.
[17:12.95]I made this.
[17:14.51]Oh, you made this.
[17:15.59]I literally made this five minutes before this shit.
[17:18.56]I can't wait to see what the guide looks like.
[17:21.88]I can't.
[17:25.06]I can't press any buttons.
[17:27.22]So, yeah, you might want to exit the game and then rejoin from... Oh, I can use controller.
[17:32.57]I mean, keyboard.
[17:34.13]Yeah, you want to exit the game and then rejoin off Jerm.
[17:37.92]No, no alt tabbing.
[17:42.14]Do you need to be yourself?
[17:44.59]No, because Star, are you going to be yourself?
[17:47.26]Did you make yourself?
[17:48.66]No, I had like 20 minutes.
[17:50.28]Why is Jermas Reddit?
[17:51.18]Did you Google that?
[17:53.75]No, I didn't.
[17:56.50]That was a great poke one-liner.
[18:03.66]What was that picture?
[18:06.84]Like, where was that?
[18:07.93]Like, why does it look like a mugshot, dude?
[18:09.49]This is, okay, this is one day before Dollhouse.
[18:12.79]This is the pre-Dollhouse stream where I was telling people what the hell was going to happen over the course of a week.
[18:18.64]And in the Dollhouse studio, the place where we did all this, there was a room set up where I could stream.
[18:24.65]I only streamed for like an hour.
[18:26.41]And it was just a gray room with a desk.
[18:30.93]And everybody kept calling me Deposition Andy.
[18:34.55]So I just decided to go, oh, that's so funny.
[18:39.18]And I looked into the camera as if it was a deposition.
[18:42.86]And then my whole life turned upside down for the rest of my life.
[18:46.55]Yeah, pretty much.
[18:49.09]That's pretty funny.
[18:50.25]Okay.
[18:50.39]It's nice to have context for the photo now.
[18:53.01]Thank you.
[18:54.05]Hulk, where's that picture taken?
[18:57.66]I actually don't know.
[19:01.74]I don't know where this photo's from.
[19:03.99]Is that Jack Black from Minecraft?
[19:06.71]Why do you and Vinny look like you're in the same universe right now?
[19:11.01]We can do this if you want to do this.
[19:13.48]I feel like we'll all match, yeah.
[19:15.48]Alright, let's go.
[19:16.24]Let's do it.
[19:17.14]How do we go?
[19:18.04]Ready up.
[19:24.87]One sec, fixing my shit.
[19:31.19]I hope I can do Flint and steel confirm again uh apparently you have to double confirm oh hey poke you're getting roped right now your characters level up separately yeah
[19:58.36]Oh my god.
[19:59.88]I fucking hate this already.
[20:01.06]I want to switch characters already.
[20:04.12]Is it working?
[20:05.13]Yep.
[20:11.45]Oh, yours is incredible, Poke.
[20:13.30]Oh, I hate this picture already.
[20:14.34]Wait, my bomb looks like a... I gotta change it.
[20:20.04]That does not look like a bomb!
[20:22.00]No, you're good.
[20:23.94]You're good.
[20:24.36]Just mute- delete the stream.
[20:26.63]Dude, it's fine.
[20:27.71]It looks like a bong.
[20:30.59]You guys want me to change it?
[20:33.30]How did Steve accept it?
[20:37.04]It really does look so fucked up.
[20:38.56]Alright, so... I really regret my Hide the Pain Harold character.
[20:42.93]I'm just saying.
[20:44.71]My stomach.
[20:46.01]Oh, redo.
[20:46.71]Everybody redo.
[20:48.03]No one's happy?
[20:50.13]I just hate this default picture.
[20:51.51]I look like such a fucking clown.
[20:54.02]That looks like 12-year-old Jerma.
[20:56.08]It does.
[20:56.56]It really does look like I'm like nine.
[20:58.57]I look like 11.
[20:59.81]Do you have another one?
[21:00.69]You said there were two, right?

[22:21.10]Like all the enemies?
[22:22.78]I downloaded the ones to do it, but none of them are changed.

[25:58.13]Or SpongeBob.
[25:59.38]Can I not be me?
[26:01.16]I should be like... I could be Steve.
[26:06.14]You didn't want to be Steve though, no?
[26:07.86]You were like pissed.
[26:09.24]We're just gonna restart again.
[26:10.49]Oh.
[26:18.53]Oh, Pepino, that's cool.
[26:27.87]I like that one of the characters, like one of the top characters in the workshop right now is Ranch.
[26:33.81]It's the bottle of Ranch.
[26:35.78]If I edit my weapon, will it have enough time?
[26:40.24]Vinny, that is a really cool one.
[26:42.76]That's not just a face.
[26:45.04]That's a lot of detail on that one.
[26:47.43]And you didn't... You hate your fans.
[26:49.75]How are you doing, Vinny?
[26:51.83]Oh, I don't?
[26:52.99]A little bit, but not always.
[26:54.53]No!

[26:57.98]I'm doing good.
[26:58.58]Thank you.
[26:59.14]Thank you.
[26:59.44]I'm very tired.
[27:00.10]I had a couple busy days.
[27:02.08]And, uh...
[27:03.66]Yeah, I'm doing good.
[27:04.46]I played Metal Gear Delta.
[27:05.84]It was good.
[27:07.81]I liked it.
[27:09.63]Metal Gear Delta?
[27:11.05]Yeah, it's a 3 remake.
[27:15.12]I enjoyed that.
[27:15.82]I got to play it a little bit.
[27:17.30]It was fun.
[27:20.47]Oh, fuck.
[27:20.83]I'm there twice.
[27:23.77]I'm changing my sword.
[27:24.49]What should I get?
[27:26.78]Oh, but if you're going to be Mr. Krabs, then I have to be SpongeBob.
[27:30.85]Okay, let's do it.
[27:32.61]I have to be Homer Simpson.
[27:34.41]No, you have to be the really well-made Vinny.
[27:41.86]Guys, I can make any weapon right now for my character.
[27:44.60]What weapon should I use?
[27:45.74]Make a gun, but it's a melee weapon.
[27:50.14]Okay.
[27:50.53]Make, like, an AK.
[27:52.15]I think that you should, like, round out the top of that bong that you made.
[27:58.01]Like, what, like a dome?
[27:59.11]Like, put a dome at the end of it?
[28:01.95]They won't pass the inspection.
[28:03.75]You know that, Ster.
[28:05.89]Like, you're gonna get poked fans.
[28:07.03]Yeah, that's why they had to check his.
[28:09.83]Alright, guys, I'll be Miku.
[28:11.47]Do a poll in my chat.
[28:12.43]It has to have at least 80% yeses, and I'll do it.
[28:16.38]You gotta be over 80%.
[28:17.38]Do you guys like pizza on or off the cob?
[28:31.80]Off.
[28:33.66]On.
[28:35.08]Okay, cool.
[28:35.68]Wait, what do you mean?
[28:38.06]Damn it, don't make me elaborate, Polk.
[28:41.47]Can you elaborate for me?
[28:42.35]Because I am confused.
[28:46.85]Oh, wait.
[28:49.13]Did you say corn or pizza?
[28:51.03]I said pizza.
[28:53.42]Corn is so good.
[28:57.58]Yeah, I had some corn today.
[28:59.88]Very happy about that.
[29:02.29]It's good chat, I know.
[29:03.55]Vinny, do you get to the end of the corn and do you just like suck out all the juices in the middle of the corn?
[29:08.94]What are you talking about?
[29:10.54]You eat all the corn, all the kernels off the corn, and then you bite into it and just suck out the corn syrup.
[29:17.77]No, I've never sucked the cob.
[29:20.35]You're talking about eating like the bone marrow of the corn cob?
[29:23.68]Where do you think corn syrup comes from?
[29:28.36]I'm not sure.
[29:29.90]I'm going to try that.
[29:32.94]uh dude you know that like most of the sugar that you've ever had in your whole life where sweetener has been came from the in the middle of that corn what the hell hang on a second let me crush up those corns siri is this true I get the baby corn so I can feel bigger ask siri on stream if corn syrup comes from corn
[29:57.94]Okay, I'm gonna go into Google, alright, on my phone.
[30:00.19]Here we go.
[30:01.29]Gork.
[30:01.91]Does corn syrup come from the cob of corn?
[30:04.62]Cob.
[30:07.94]No, corn syrup does not come from the corn cob, according to Gork.
[30:13.71]It's, wait, what is it?
[30:14.70]Whoa, it's made from cornstarch, which is extracted from the endosperm of the corn kernel.
[30:19.73]Yeah.
[30:22.24]That's just what you said.
[30:23.25]I remember you said that exact thing.
[30:25.09]If you bite into the corn at the end, when all the kernels are gone, and you kind of just suck it up like a vampire, it's sweet.
[30:33.07]Tastes like sugar.
[30:35.62]Wait, that's corn syrup?
[30:39.72]Yeah.
[30:39.84]According to Gork.
[30:40.86]Yeah, according to Gork, that's true.
[30:42.82]They call it the endosperm.
[30:49.29]So it comes from corn.
[30:50.19]Yeah.
[30:50.81]It's corn.
[30:52.30]Okay, I made myself a new weapon.
[30:53.74]What about a shield?
[30:55.50]Oh, man, I tabbed out again.
[30:56.91]I don't know.
[30:57.53]We'll see you in an hour, Poke.
[31:00.21]Why?
[31:01.61]Because we're in the ready menu.
[31:03.70]Okay, here comes some corn kernels, not corn cob.
[31:08.32]It's the same fucking unit.
[31:10.41]It's the same vegetable.
[31:11.91]Oh, no, it doesn't come from corn on the cob.
[31:13.39]It comes from corn kernels.
[31:15.02]It's the same vegetable.
[31:18.08]That's where they make candy corn.
[31:22.39]I didn't know you guys were waiting on me.
[31:23.39]I'm so sorry.
[31:23.99]I'm coming.
[31:28.42]Alright.
[31:32.59]Somebody said, why am I sucking endosperm?
[31:35.58]Alright, bro.
[31:36.72]That's how you get yourself deleted.
[31:41.37]I thought you guys were all setting up your characters.
[31:43.25]I'm so sorry.
[31:44.50]We taught him... I just taught that chat member a cursed piece of knowledge, and now he is banned.
[31:51.43]Yeah, fuck that guy.
[31:52.41]You did this to him.
[31:53.67]Yeah, you know, there's like... Do you know that only corn... The corn that we eat is... It's like one breed out of like a billion.
[32:01.98]We... Most corn is inedible.
[32:05.93]We made it that way.
[32:06.95]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[32:07.83]Yeah, we kind of... Yeah, I remember hearing something like that.
[32:10.07]Yeah.
[32:12.29]But we also, we did that with a lot of different types of, like, animals and fruit to make it better.
[32:21.58]Because we're like little freaks, us humans.
[32:25.43]Poke, you gonna be your guy?
[32:27.65]Uh... Controller's not working.
[32:31.29]Did Miku win, by the way?
[32:32.56]I didn't see.

[32:38.78]Join fresh.
[32:40.45]This is my worst day ever.
[32:41.83]No, it's okay.
[32:42.98]We're all kind of trying to figure this out.
[32:45.32]It's the game, too.
[32:47.50]If I was the last known man in the universe, that would be the endosperm.
[32:54.25]What does that mean?
[33:00.05]Oh, sure.
[33:00.53]Don't dignify that with a response.
[33:02.01]Wait, wait.
[33:02.66]Why does chat think... Wait, is there a joke there?
[33:05.56]Wait, there's no slots in the room.

[34:37.87]Seriously, I think that this needs to be... Congress has to step the fuck in.
[34:41.54]Because A is... It only should have been the Super Nintendo controller going forward forever.
[34:48.26]And then all of a sudden...
[34:50.54]PlayStation's like, you know what?
[34:51.70]Let's add fucking shapes.
[34:53.74]And then Microsoft's like, let's just take the Nintendo's controller and just spin it.
[34:58.45]Let's rotate it one degree to the right and ruin everything.
[35:03.64]Every controller is different.
[35:06.30]What button first?
[35:07.88]The bottom one.
[35:09.34]The bottom one?
[35:11.07]Up and down to choose your character?
[35:13.27]It's green.
[35:14.07]The bottom button made me leave last time.
[35:17.18]The bottom button is green on Xbox, right?
[35:19.16]It should be...
[35:21.07]You're on Xbox Poke, right?
[35:23.57]Yes.
[35:24.19]Yeah, it's green.
[35:24.81]A. Bottom one.
[35:26.75]Bottom one.
[35:27.31]Are you sure you want to leave the game?
[35:28.90]Do it now!
[35:31.58]Then press the bottom one again so you don't leave.
[35:36.02]I'll time you.
[35:36.56]We'll have to wait the 60 seconds, I guess.
[35:39.13]I'm telling you, I'm not trolling.
[35:41.61]I think my shit's fucked.
[35:43.29]Your face looks as confused as you sound.

[35:58.64]Alright, press it again.
[36:01.14]Yeah, let's go.
[36:02.39]I'm colorblind!
[36:03.89]We forget how to get through the menu.
[36:07.74]Wait, why did it work last time?
[36:10.20]Folk, you still have a penis.
[36:12.66]It's a penis.
[36:18.68]I thought you gave yourself a new weapon.
[36:20.38]We gotta remake me.
[36:21.70]No, dude.
[36:23.85]You'll get a new one.
[36:24.67]There's more weapons that you can unlock in the game.
[36:27.09]Is it actually a penis?
[36:28.35]Like, if I said it wasn't a penis... Is it actually a penis?
[36:31.78]No, it's not, right?
[36:33.44]Your character is, like, too well made.
[36:36.72]It's amazing.
[36:38.08]For this, what we're... Is that K. Rool?
[36:40.97]Yeah.
[36:42.07]Oh, cool.
[36:42.63]Oh, shit.
[36:50.66]Miku's hair is, like, very big.
[36:54.60]You are massive.
[36:56.20]At least I won't lose where I am on the screen.
[37:04.45]I made my second shield look like a vape.
[37:07.74]So when I block, it looks like I'm hitting it.

[38:03.71]Yo.
[38:06.78]Stero, I feel like your character is perfect for you.
[38:12.04]Oh, because you think I'm a little crybaby?
[38:14.49]No, it's just, it's got, I don't know, it has your energy for some reason.
[38:17.89]Not even because it's crying.
[38:18.77]There was some very well-made Isaacs.
[38:24.78]Oh, I remember a good tactic in this game is, like, the jump juggle.
[38:28.92]Like, you could do shit like that.
[38:30.99]Oh, it's so good.
[38:31.77]I remember, oh, this was fun.
[38:33.17]Jumping magic too, right?
[38:44.21]No.
[38:50.80]It's like the Xbox 360 days all over again.
[38:53.26]Call of Duty.
[38:54.40]Modern Warfare.
[38:56.53]Battlefield.
[38:56.99]GTA 4.

[39:25.55]Am I going magic?
[39:27.36]I don't know, what do you guys want to do?
[39:28.74]Magic, strength, defense, speed, agility?
[39:37.35]There's four of us.
[39:38.71]We could do whatever.
[39:40.95]Did I go back?
[39:44.00]Uh... The blacksmith had... This is the same level?
[39:46.18]Okay.
[39:47.28]I made a mistake.
[39:51.83]You made a big mistake.
[39:53.63]How's the poke the only one that levels up?
[39:55.25]I want to go to the blacksmith with you guys.
[39:59.62]Wait, what's going on?
[40:01.24]We go in here to see new weapons.
[40:03.71]So, Poke, if you want a weapon that isn't a bong, here you go.
[40:09.49]We already got a lot of shit unlocked.
[40:11.55]Yeah, why so much?
[40:12.57]We already have a lot of stuff.
[40:15.52]Oh, my God.
[40:15.98]Why are there so many things?
[40:18.52]There's so much room for more.
[40:20.08]Oh, spaghetti and meatballs.
[40:21.94]Oh, a toilet paper thing.
[40:24.83]I can just take these for free?
[40:25.91]Oh, you need to be level 15.
[40:27.89]These are high level.
[40:29.15]Yeah, we got to go back.
[40:33.59]I like that the side of Isaac's head is like square.
[40:38.48]OK, these are level one.
[40:42.98]I don't do magic Archer speed.
[40:45.43]I don't know what I want to do.
[40:50.99]Why is the excellent magic?
[40:53.47]How do I get my meat back?
[40:57.78]I have to go.
[40:58.26]Oh, maybe you can't.
[41:01.58]How do I even choose one?
[41:04.30]attack.
[41:05.33]They're all... This pencil gives you plus seven magic.
[41:09.27]So you change your weapon back to your custom.
[41:11.25]Yeah.
[41:15.12]I didn't realize my weapon had changed.
[41:16.96]Me dumb.
[41:18.14]How do we know what the custom weapons do?
[41:22.05]That's a good point.
[41:24.35]Yeah, I don't know how good it is.
[41:28.36]Wait, why can't I take the hammer?
[41:30.70]Only one of us can use it.
[41:31.76]Try again.
[41:33.43]Maybe only one can have it up.
[41:34.33]Oh, here, let me go ahead and try it now.
[41:36.88]No.
[41:38.38]Weird.
[41:39.70]Oh, you can hit the paintbrush to make it still look like the thing that you, your custom thing.
[41:45.83]Oh, it's just a skin.
[41:46.81]Okay, so you choose a weapon and then choose your, oh, that's cool.
[41:49.90]Okay.
[41:52.72]Do you guys need me to turn it off?
[41:55.98]No, we're good.
[41:56.44]We're good.
[41:57.75]Alright, let's go kill stuff.
[42:05.29]Oh, we get pets too, right.
[42:09.66]I forgot about the pets.
[42:10.42]I look like a South Park character.
[42:14.78]I like your inflection on the word South Park.
[42:17.14]Can't they just follow you?
[42:18.60]South Park.
[42:20.05]South Park.
[42:23.93]Thank you.
[42:30.62]So the pets do bonuses.
[42:32.32]They do certain buffs and stuff.
[42:34.96]How do you get them to follow you?
[42:37.64]Yeah, I can't get one.
[42:38.82]I have a pet right here.
[42:41.48]Whoa, you just dropped money.
[42:42.50]I'm rich.
[42:46.93]You're all the ones who have played this.
[42:48.45]Oh, it'll tell you.
[42:49.11]Come over here.
[42:49.55]See what it does.
[42:52.63]He knocks down enemies and then... That just drops gold.
[42:56.40]That's kind of crazy.
[42:57.26]It earns me more gold, though.
[42:59.52]Maybe it earns more gold while dropping gold.
[43:01.56]Maybe.
[43:01.88]We gotta find more pets and then I think we can...
[43:04.25]Ster, you apparently unlocked this stuff, like, probably 11 years ago.
[43:10.57]Sorry?
[43:10.91]Yeah, Ster, have you played this?
[43:12.33]You said you haven't.
[43:13.17]Steam said I had 100 minutes played.
[43:15.40]What the fuck?
[43:16.52]But I don't really, like, remember anything about it.
[43:19.43]So this might be, yeah, your save file unlocked some stuff, I guess.
[43:31.12]How do you just do the regular magic fire instead of the big one?
[43:40.75]I can't do it yet.
[43:42.49]Oh, okay.
[43:48.10]I didn't know the whole game was only descent.
[43:49.80]When we see other enemies, I'll feel bad if we changed everything over to my host.
[43:57.46]I saw a clip of someone who had NPCs that were all Goku.
[44:02.53]It was like 150 Goku coming up.
[44:06.41]Oh, there's one.
[44:07.23]What the fuck is that?
[44:10.86]Really well-designed enemies.
[44:13.44]Holy shit.
[44:15.98]Nice.
[44:16.91]I'm just glad it worked.
[44:18.63]You did it, Ster.
[44:20.67]I don't want to attack them.
[44:22.15]I can't.
[44:23.27]You have to.
[44:27.00]What the heck?
[44:32.15]Get off the screen.
[44:38.78]Vinny, Vinny, do it.
[44:40.59]I'm unlocking stuff, sir.
[44:43.70]How are you doing, by the way, Vinny?
[44:46.72]Only me.
[44:47.48]I'm great since I heard Ronald McDonald is back, because me and Jerma were literally talking about that last week.
[44:52.45]They had to have heard us.
[44:56.78]Wait, I didn't know he was gone.
[44:58.64]They pivoted hard.
[45:00.54]How long has he been gone?
[45:01.46]I hadn't seen Ronald in like, yeah, like a decade.
[45:06.99]Yeah, because they realized that everybody doesn't like the fucking gray restaurant.
[45:12.91]It's snack wraps.
[45:13.89]The snack wraps are terrible.
[45:16.33]Hulk, you literally said that it was awesome.
[45:18.50]No, it's just terrible.
[45:20.36]I was just lying.
[45:21.41]I don't know.
[45:22.37]Did they give you any free snack wraps by chance?
[45:24.83]Was it actually bad?
[45:25.59]No, I just had one the other day and it was just disgusting.
[45:29.50]I got hit by the car.
[45:44.58]I'm infinitely juggling.
[45:47.57]That's when the fun stuff happens.
[45:51.57]Love those infinites.
[45:54.24]Oh, it looks like it ended for you guys.
[45:55.58]I guess it wasn't infinite.
[45:57.95]Okay.
[45:58.31]Well, let's not be too smart about it.
[46:03.28]We're having fun.
[46:03.98]We're all having fun here, sir.
[46:08.29]Ster, what games did you post?
[46:09.67]You wanted to play some stuff.
[46:11.25]What did you find?
[46:12.92]I didn't get a chance to look at them.
[46:14.62]Yeah, I mean, I think you're the only person who didn't look at them and then suggested your own game instead, and here we are.
[46:19.81]Yeah.
[46:21.17]So what games were they?
[46:25.09]I don't know.
[46:25.47]I guess we'll never know.
[46:27.51]Vinny, he's scary sometimes.
[46:28.70]I don't know.
[46:29.44]He can be a little scary.
[46:30.82]Yeah, yeah.
[46:32.68]I want to play the Ninja Turtles arcade game with you guys.
[46:34.72]I'm just like the scorpion.
[46:35.44]I'm real.
[46:36.86]I'd play that.
[46:37.82]That was the one that just came out, right?
[46:42.67]The arcade game?
[46:43.49]Like the old one.
[46:45.07]Oh, the old one.
[46:45.77]Because there was like a co-op Ninja Turtle game.
[46:49.52]But yeah, I've never played the arcade.
[46:51.92]The new one is actually great.
[46:55.61]What did you say, Star, a moment ago?
[46:59.49]No.
[47:00.29]No.
[47:00.59]What did you wait?
[47:01.59]What did you say?
[47:02.69]I don't know I was talking about stuff with Jerma.
[47:04.57]We were talking about Ninja Turtles.
[47:09.28]I Love Jerma It's cool.
[47:13.33]Yo, you know what I found out did it the other day and it freaked me out That Jerma eyelids Jerma you made that be up.
[47:21.43]Yeah, I
[47:22.76]I didn't know that!
[47:25.58]I didn't know that!
[47:26.77]I'm gonna get called a fake fan now.
[47:32.92]I didn't know you made the beer.
[47:35.32]That was a long time ago.
[47:37.02]I saw that clip too.
[47:38.67]People were like, whoa, that's Jerma?
[47:40.73]Yeah, people were getting called fake fans and shit.
[47:43.13]And then I lowered a game's volume and people are like, wow, how brave.
[47:47.31]Or wow, what a jerk.
[47:48.62]And that's been going around again.
[47:50.24]What a jerk?
[47:52.30]I remember that.
[47:53.14]That's funny.
[47:53.90]Yeah, yeah.
[47:57.87]Oh, what a jerk.
[47:59.85]I lowered the volume.
[48:01.05]Damn.
[48:02.53]Very controversial.
[48:06.85]Ster hates Demon's Souls that's like kind of controversial oh do you end up playing on this stream what what was that stream like I I enjoyed it like I absolutely had like one of my biggest gamer meltdowns but in the end I think it's it's pretty good game why was it a boss or uh a mechanic he pissed you off he thought flamethrower was a little too hard for those of us that beat the first try we did a lot there's a lot all at once
[48:41.99]Yeah, this is the scene where all the NPCs were Goku.
[48:45.19]I don't know how to make that happen, but that seems like it could be.
[48:48.02]Even the people tied up?
[48:50.34]No, I don't think so.
[48:53.74]I'm almost dead.
[48:55.54]Yeah.
[48:56.74]Yeah, we're kind of getting smushed here.
[49:00.13]Oh.
[49:01.63]I think there's a revive, though.
[49:09.16]I think the trick to this game is like hitting him.
[49:15.01]I'm a dead guy.
[49:15.77]Oh, you're right.
[49:17.57]You have to time it.
[49:18.56]Did your character make Miku noises?
[49:22.14]No, I think those... I love how you called it Miku noises.
[49:31.69]I don't know what else to say.
[49:33.57]Wait, I should level magic and then spam saws, no?
[49:37.43]That's what I'm going to do.
[49:38.13]I'm going to go magic.
[49:39.37]Are you doing saws, though?
[49:41.06]I'm doing rainbows.
[49:51.11]Oh shit.
[49:52.77]We're all almost kind of dead here.
[49:54.85]I'm a dead guy.
[49:56.92]Look at me dead on the floor.
[50:00.18]Try to get you back.
[50:01.64]He's on me.
[50:02.18]He's on me.
[50:05.71]I'm dead.
[50:06.15]I'm dead now.
[50:08.11]Come on Miku.
[50:14.26]Get that banana Miku.
[50:23.19]Okay.
[50:29.97]That's a full team revive.
[50:31.04]That should give me at least... Hell yeah.
[50:32.26]...50 bucks.
[50:36.28]Cheebo.
[50:40.36]Fuuuuck.
[50:43.37]Oh, you got a rez off.
[50:45.19]Oh.
[50:48.95]Am I just gone?
[50:49.43]I'm on the ground.
[50:50.69]I think you're on the ground.
[50:53.28]Oh.
[50:55.10]Oh.
[50:57.92]So this is what video games were like in the 80s, huh?
[51:00.39]I'm down.
[51:02.31]It's just Easter.
[51:04.81]I don't know what to do.
[51:05.50]Spam it.
[51:05.80]Spam it.
[51:06.12]Spam it.
[51:06.52]I pressed it.
[51:07.36]You can just spam it.
[51:10.36]So pressing it while it's in the middle gets more health, but you can just spam it and it gets people up quick.
[51:14.71]Nice.
[51:28.33]I'm back, too.
[51:29.21]Okay, good.
[51:36.72]That didn't seem to give very much more health.
[51:42.90]I want to go to Blacksmith and get the pencil again.
[51:46.99]I think, yeah, we need some new weapons.
[51:48.73]All of us, perhaps.
[51:51.09]Help me!
[51:51.85]Alright, there you go.
[51:53.76]Pick me up, please.
[51:54.60]I want the money.
[51:55.16]Yeah.
[51:58.01]Do it, do it.
[52:01.01]Yeah.
[52:09.81]Whoa.
[52:14.01]And then I'm gonna start singing.
[52:17.12]Oh, wait, really?
[52:22.90]It killed me.
[52:25.26]I'm fucking decimated.
[52:27.42]Yeah.
[52:29.85]I didn't know that.
[52:30.75]I don't know the rules.
[52:38.66]Wow.
[52:41.82]Okay, I did terrible.
[52:46.81]New character.
[52:54.10]You going speed, huh?
[53:06.12]You're so powerful.
[53:06.98]I can't de-level?
[53:15.89]There's no de-leveling.
[53:20.97]Let's go back to the blacksmith.
[53:22.73]Grab us a slightly better weapon maybe.
[53:28.06]I'm cool with the pencil still.
[53:37.18]I need like a non-level.
[53:38.66]Oh, there's a level five.
[53:39.62]That's the next one up.
[53:48.15]This thing is just beating us money.
[53:49.67]It's great.
[53:51.10]Pencil is just magic, it seems.
[53:54.72]Pencil is kind of crazy.
[54:00.03]Wait.
[54:00.71]Wait, guys.
[54:01.15]One second.
[54:01.59]One second.
[54:04.62]Just wanted to grab.
[54:07.44]Yeah, there's really not much.
[54:08.47]Okay, never mind.
[54:10.15]Just grab this.
[54:12.43]Oh, I can do it.
[54:14.48]Pencil is from new DLC character that just came out.
[54:16.90]It's kind of OP.
[54:20.99]Well, hell yeah.
[54:24.17]Do we have to pay for power in this?
[54:27.76]What do you think, Jerm?
[54:29.98]Let's do dock.
[54:34.87]Oh, I think this is... Oh, right.
[54:38.13]Oh, we need the items.
[54:39.67]All of it's flooding back to me.
[54:41.11]It is.
[54:43.84]oh yeah the the item the windmill who up wonk and they willy right now I don't know locked in cat this is a classic song it is a good song gotta raise volume
[55:13.39]By the way, Stuart, it's great that we only have just this cat picture as the only thing that's been here.
[55:17.65]No, there was just others on the screen.
[55:19.04]You missed it.
[55:20.88]They blended in.
[55:21.46]You didn't even notice.
[55:29.55]They take up so much screen real estate.
[55:32.54]They're insane.
[55:34.62]I love them.
[55:35.30]I'm so glad I'm Miku so I can see where I am.
[55:37.87]The bright, light blue.
[55:55.46]This brings back a lot of good memories.
[55:59.16]What, of hitting cats?
[56:01.00]No!
[56:02.23]What did you extrapolate from that?
[56:05.97]That you started hitting cats and you just got flashbacks.
[56:10.70]Like, weird childhood.
[56:12.32]Oh, dude.
[56:15.08]No, of riding dinosaurs.
[56:18.15]Oh, animal friends!
[56:19.05]Hitting cats with your friends.
[56:23.54]That's a little weird.
[56:24.60]I wouldn't recommend it.
[56:28.26]I'd rather be playing Towerborn, honestly.
[56:29.92]Poked you with Towerborn again?
[56:34.11]Ster and I actually opened it off-screen.
[56:37.45]And we got into the game.
[56:38.69]We were like, let's go, man.
[56:39.60]I want to fucking go.
[56:40.44]And then it was just like, I don't know why, but it was just like, hey, wait, let's play Nightreign.
[56:46.08]No, because I kept saying, are you sure you want to?
[56:48.25]I wanted to play.
[56:49.23]I kept asking you, are you sure you want to play?
[56:50.99]And you were like, uh, yeah, I mean, like, I don't know.
[56:54.05]I wanted to play it I could just tell that there was a hankering for Nightreign on the run that time it just was unfortunate that Nightreign we were kind of in a Nightreign kind of mode that night I still have only played it once with you guys that's it was it is it like good still like it yeah there's dual modes
[57:28.27]Does that hurt, Jermo?
[57:30.77]A little.
[57:31.95]I'd say Demon's Souls is probably top three for me.
[57:37.22]Do you like Demon's Souls more than Nightreign?
[57:42.23]Uh, yes.
[57:44.85]Yes, I do.
[57:47.90]I kind of think that's not fair, though.
[57:50.22]Because Nightreign is... Okay, you know, like, TNMT tournament fighters...
[57:57.87]No.
[57:58.73]Okay.
[57:59.47]Well, Nightreign is like a TMNT Tournament Fighters.
[58:04.02]It's not a main game.
[58:06.28]Do you know what I mean?
[58:09.51]Oh, so you're not allowed to value it as a game because it's not a game.
[58:12.61]No, I'm just saying it's not.
[58:13.53]It's not something that you bought and played.
[58:15.32]It's not a traditional.
[58:17.54]It's okay.
[58:18.70]They're not the same game.
[58:19.66]They're not in the same type of game.
[58:23.03]Okay, because when it came out, I heard a lot of people say, wow, it's fucking, what a ripoff that it's the same game.
[58:31.58]But now it's not the same game.
[58:35.88]I don't know.
[58:41.09]I think Nightran's good.
[58:42.01]I don't know where to put it in the grand Bible list of things, right?
[58:47.31]FromSoftware Bible list.
[58:48.97]Okay, Fence Sitter.
[58:51.03]Did you play Armored Core?
[58:52.65]I played it.
[58:56.64]Did you beat Armored Core?
[58:58.10]You did, right?
[59:00.42]I think I got right to the end.
[59:04.01]But I never beat it.
[59:05.23]The game was fucking awesome.
[59:07.75]I had fun with it.
[59:10.07]I should go back to it.
[59:12.36]I finished it.
[59:13.68]People were like, you should beat it three times.
[59:16.14]I'm like, nah, I'm good.
[59:17.50]But it was fun.
[59:20.49]I'm a weird FromSoft fan.
[59:22.81]Someone took my... Where the hell's my pencil?
[59:25.27]Uh oh.
[59:26.70]Is it there?
[59:27.18]On the ground?
[59:28.08]No, I think... Uh oh.
[59:29.52]No, it's okay.
[59:30.00]It's just a skin.
[59:30.60]It's a skin.
[59:31.96]Oh.
[59:32.86]I don't know.
[59:33.99]I'm a big fan of Armored Core 2.
[59:38.57]The OGs.
[59:38.95]I remember this.
[59:40.78]Poop.
[59:40.90]I remember this.
[59:41.50]I remember poop.
[59:44.36]Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Demon's Souls.
[59:47.73]I think are my top three.
[59:49.85]you know I I didn't play uh Demon's Souls Jerm you have to go if you want to he'll buy you a PS5 I have one I'm good but I also I'm weird because Dark Souls I tried to get into it three times and it just never clicked but I love Bloodborne I love Elden Ring I love Sekiro Dark Souls one and Demon's Souls I think are tied in the same spot or third
[60:20.33]for me.
[60:21.65]I didn't like Sekiro that much.
[60:25.01]It's fun.
[60:25.41]I got stuck at the first, uh, boar boss, whatever it was.
[60:30.22]Oh, you got filtered.
[60:32.41]Yeah.
[60:34.47]I got stuck in the first, like, uh, dog, whatever it is.
[60:37.59]I was like, yeah, I don't like this.
[60:40.80]The bull.
[60:41.50]The bull.
[60:41.98]Yeah, I can't do it.
[60:44.53]I beat Sekiro, but I think it was very painful.
[60:50.22]Not that I didn't like it, but it was just... It was not bad pain, it was just pain, though.
[60:59.85]It's like the parrying stuff got really insane.
[61:03.55]But it worked, you know, I liked it, finished it.
[61:07.40]Weirdly, like, Sekiro was very hard with the parrying and everything, but I think parrying's the future.
[61:14.23]I think you're starting to see more, like, parrying rather than dodge rolls in this game.
[61:20.06]Nice.
[61:21.70]Sekiro walks so everyone else in the rest of the universe could run.
[61:27.13]What game was I playing recently that had the parry?
[61:30.90]Parry slop.
[61:31.56]What was that?
[61:33.48]Parry slop.
[61:38.19]Oh, the cat.
[61:38.77]I remember the cat.
[61:41.83]Is there roll slop?
[61:44.35]Dodge slop?
[61:45.46]Yeah, roll slop is 100% like all.
[61:48.78]I'm dead!
[61:49.20]Can we all get filtered with Vinny?
[61:55.61]Oh, bye.
[61:56.46]You guys remember Battletoads when they did this?
[61:59.59]Oh, got filtered.
[62:00.87]Um, yeah, Battletoads.
[62:03.25]Talking about a hard game.
[62:05.13]I was literally just talking, I had this conversation recently about, like, NES games that I just never beat.
[62:11.96]And, yeah, that was one of them.
[62:14.52]Castlevania was one of them.
[62:16.30]When I was a kid, at least.
[62:17.90]And yet, Zelda 2?
[62:19.16]No problem.
[62:20.58]Huh.
[62:21.59]It's weird, yeah.
[62:22.85]Did you ever do the original NES Ninja Turtles game?
[62:27.34]I'm like dead dead.
[62:28.51]Oh man.
[62:29.71]Because that one was crazy.
[62:32.11]You were playing that tonight, weren't you?
[62:33.83]I just was, yeah.
[62:36.02]Are you in a turtle mood?
[62:38.32]Yeah, I kind of was just feeling it.
[62:40.34]Me and Squeaks were talking about Turtles in Time and I was like, let me check it out.
[62:44.97]The Cowabunga collection has every game ever made.
[62:47.84]It's awesome.
[62:57.28]come on is this a mobile game?
[63:03.03]it's a Ninja Turtles compilation museum slash oh these goddamn cats
[63:26.76]Were you a Power Ranger guy?
[63:36.22]Oh, yeah.
[63:36.90]Specifically Poke, I'm asking.
[63:38.88]Oh, no.
[63:39.92]Okay, how about you, Jerma?
[63:41.44]Yes.
[63:42.57]How about you, Ster?
[63:44.09]I dressed up as the White Ranger for Halloween.
[63:46.81]okay understood that was that was like before like right when the right ranger white rangers coming out and no one really like knew who he was yet and he was like super mysterious yeah when it was revealed that tommy was went from green to white ranger it was like bigger than when Gandalf came back as the white wizard yeah yeah that was that was crazy I remember that I remember that damn I sucked
[64:15.82]I'm out of touch.
[64:17.58]It's uncultured.
[64:20.65]It's cats shooting arrows at us.
[64:24.25]I'm dead!
[64:27.56]Let's go back and res him.
[64:31.28]Ah!
[64:32.08]Holy shit.
[64:32.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[64:34.17]Did you say you wanted to play Hammer Watch 2?
[64:37.85]Oh yeah!
[64:41.38]Didn't you guys already do that and have a horseman ending crash out stream?
[64:46.95]Yeah, kind of.
[64:48.63]You joined at the very end and got disappointed and then left.
[64:52.46]It was your fault though, Jerma.
[64:54.34]It actually was.
[64:55.50]It was your fault.
[64:56.26]I'll take the blame for it.
[64:59.11]What were you doing?
[64:59.67]You were playing like a game or something?
[65:02.05]That wasn't... Yeah.
[65:05.86]I'm dead.
[65:06.32]I'll allow it.
[65:07.10]I'll allow it.
[65:08.67]Yeah, I was doing I was doing a Chrono Trigger nostalgia playthrough Vinny.
[65:14.60]You understand, I understand.
[65:16.50]We have to beat this alone.
[65:21.75]Oh man.
[65:28.57]Oh shit, he's punching me.
[65:33.06]He hasn't missed yet.
[65:36.04]The cats are smoking a fucking wand?
[65:45.76]We should all play Tarkov.
[65:49.86]Okay, Poke.
[65:50.88]Can I ask you a question?
[65:52.95]what are you gonna say what even happens in that game just all I want to know if what do you do in tarka what is it what do you do I've seen you loading up a raid and there's a watch out there's a scavenger there what give me like a quick this is what is happening in the game um
[66:17.96]A lot, really.
[66:18.72]It's... You know, questing.
[66:24.07]You, uh, kill people.
[66:25.46]We're gonna break the hairball, Jerma.
[66:28.24]Honestly, it's just freaking out about your loot and losing all your loot.
[66:32.58]You walk around and you pick up like pencils and staplers and then some guy who's like at 4 FPS shoots you from a window you could never have possibly seen.
[66:41.74]And you go back and you do it again.
[66:42.88]Yeah, kind of.
[66:44.19]The limited experience I have.
[66:45.45]But you do it like 30 times in a row and you're like, wait, that window, someone could shoot me.
[66:49.66]And then...
[66:50.46]so but other other I sometimes I see you get on like a train sometimes I see you oh I'm gonna leave I'm getting out of here like there's specific areas that you are going to
[67:00.35]Yeah, it's a big map.
[67:02.13]People spawn on separate sides of each other, right?
[67:05.54]And their extract is where you spawned usually, and your extract is where they spawned.
[67:10.06]But there's multiple extracts.
[67:11.93]And you meet in the middle, and you fight, or you just go a different route and get to their spot and extract.
[67:19.92]Does that make sense?
[67:20.94]The only extract I'm interested in is vanilla.
[67:23.52]Vanilla.
[67:24.13]Ah, I knew you were going to do that.
[67:26.91]This guy, I know you, the back of your hand.
[67:29.03]Any orange extract fans of the vanilla extract?
[67:38.23]Yeah.
[67:38.35]It's a good game.
[67:39.25]Did we miss it?
[67:40.59]I don't know.
[67:41.56]Yeah, me and Jerma played Dark and Darker.
[67:43.40]I love that game.
[67:44.18]It's just that, but shoot.
[67:45.86]It's that with shoot.
[67:47.09]As Tarkov.
[67:47.97]It's not the same exact thing, but yeah, it's in the ballpark.
[67:52.09]They're addictive.
[67:53.56]I was joking, by the way, about us playing Tarkov.
[67:56.58]Oh my god.
[67:57.26]Didn't Call of Duty do an extraction shooter thing?
[68:00.51]Yeah, it was terrible.
[68:01.65]Yeah, it was in Deck 3.
[68:04.55]Vinny, you have to do this.
[68:09.28]Show us why you are Vinny.
[68:11.98]got so much health I was named that because I was born in New York show us why you are Vinny gaming okay thank you oh big block you can block this game left trigger indeed
[68:39.39]Yeah, it's the smoking blunt animation.
[68:41.45]Yeah, that's what I was thinking, yeah.
[68:46.58]Ooh, don't like that.
[68:49.47]Don't like that.
[68:51.53]Somebody said, dude, it's so funny, the mod made, like, a big cat character.
[69:03.74]He's going to get all the money and all the XP, by the way.
[69:06.34]He's going to be so overleveled and has so much cool stuff instead of us.
[69:09.74]Wait, does it work like that?
[69:10.85]He deserves it.
[69:16.27]Fuck you, god damn it.
[69:20.07]Oh.
[69:25.32]Damn, your picture's cool.
[69:28.48]This is a cool picture.
[69:31.36]A sleepy Gigachad.
[69:42.74]And then here I am.
[69:43.52]Are we going all magic, Andy?
[69:45.42]All of us?
[69:47.16]The saw blades go kind of crazy.
[69:48.74]Seems like, why not?
[69:50.32]That'll bring us to the blacksmith, I think.
[69:53.01]I have the opportunity to use a new weapon.
[69:57.19]This is my other magic move.
[69:58.75]What the hell is this?
[70:03.80]I just throw, like, funny creatures.
[70:07.44]Throw acorns?
[70:15.63]Poke, what's your other move?
[70:18.25]I have another move?
[70:19.51]Yeah, hold right trigger and B. Oh!
[70:28.35]Cool.
[70:28.47]Can we go this way for a sec?
[70:33.51]I need a level 5 weapon, that's good.
[70:35.26]I'm the fat friend that walks slow.
[70:36.64]Hey guys, wait for me.
[70:38.82]Okay, no, it's only this.
[70:40.03]I'll get this.
[70:42.63]Are you guys fast walkers in real life?
[70:44.69]Oh, yeah.
[70:45.37]Yeah.
[70:46.07]Yeah, it's bad.
[70:47.85]It's bad.
[70:48.45]It's bad.
[70:50.97]Like, people can't keep up with me.
[70:53.38]No, no, I'm good.
[70:54.72]I just feel bad because I walk so damn fast.
[70:57.60]My people are like, God damn, Benny, stop that.
[70:59.74]Oh, we can go to a store and buy potions.
[71:03.44]Where's the store?
[71:05.25]Where's that?
[71:08.57]Do we have to beat the whole level first?
[71:14.32]Oh, it's just here.
[71:27.36]How many should we buy?
[71:28.00]How do you use them?
[71:29.34]I think they use it automatically.
[71:30.44]Bumpers.
[71:32.84]You could use the bumpers to switch to them, and then press B. Okay, well, I got five potions.
[71:41.21]How do I buy it?
[71:42.80]I'm confused.
[71:44.62]You can have up to five.
[71:45.53]You gotta whack it.
[71:56.17]How do I lower the price?
[71:56.99]Oh.
[72:01.35]Oh!
[72:15.78]How do I just buy it?
[72:17.58]You have five now.
[72:18.68]Smack it.
[72:19.56]You got five.
[72:20.08]Yeah, you're good.
[72:21.98]Alright, now we're ready for the boss.
[72:23.39]Now we'll go kill this thing.
[72:27.21]Alright.
[72:27.51]Thief store?
[72:28.33]There's another store.
[72:30.26]Oh, we got the branch already, I think.
[72:34.30]Nice of the cat to sell us some stuff, though.
[72:36.51]You can get bombs, too.
[72:40.39]I'll take a few bombs.
[72:41.19]Why not?
[72:42.46]That's a Q-cap.
[72:49.42]Alright.
[72:53.49]Help me.
[72:55.05]I got to watch Vinny show me how it's done.
[72:56.67]I didn't know you could stand on things.
[73:00.61]It's good.
[73:01.48]But yeah, a hairball always.
[73:13.03]I'm dead.
[73:14.93]No, you're fine.
[73:15.77]You're going to make it, buddy.
[73:21.77]I need a mount.
[73:23.68]Sorry.
[73:24.00]I need a mount too.
[73:26.74]I haven't been on one yet.
[73:30.42]Oh my God, those blades.
[73:35.11]Oh my God.
[73:35.99]He's punching me in the head.
[73:55.71]He didn't get hit by that?
[74:04.46]He blocked.
[74:15.92]I'm gonna block.
[74:19.79]What the hell, he came for me?
[74:23.73]Big piece of shit.
[74:34.49]Wow, look at that.
[74:36.47]Big damage.
[74:37.13]We got it.
[74:38.25]We got it.
[74:40.08]Proud of us.
[74:40.46]Stop hitting me!
[74:41.34]Yeah, what the fuck?
[74:45.58]He's too big.
[74:50.07]Look, I'm on a cat.
[74:51.01]What the hell?
[75:13.23]You did that voice?
[75:14.84]Yeah.
[75:15.04]In the game?
[75:15.84]No.
[75:17.92]Poke.
[75:18.04]Look, poke is still counting.
[75:22.41]What'd I do?
[75:23.05]Crazy.
[75:23.93]Crazy amount of damage.
[75:25.93]You're a fucking champion.
[75:28.29]Thank you.
[75:29.71]Is it X or O?
[75:32.32]The bottom one, I think?
[75:33.36]I don't know.
[75:34.98]Now I'm confused.
[75:35.90]I'm second-guessing my own controls.
[75:39.13]Square, I think?
[75:41.85]No, it was circle.
[75:44.08]poke has the best magic in the game by the way I'm being told by a chat member wait wasn't this song used in like a lot of stuff oh no cat tua why did you say cat there's four of them
[76:14.37]Oh no, because this is the second like type of cat enemy.
[76:18.56]I did not try and do a theme.
[76:20.38]It's a coincidence.
[76:35.30]Gotta blow the horn here.
[76:49.74]It does get confusing sometimes with the cats being, you know, huge heads.
[76:54.15]I don't know, sometimes you just get lost behind the cats.
[76:58.97]I'm sorry.
[76:59.49]Yeah, sometimes I think I'm, uh... I already made that joke earlier.
[77:07.50]Oh, never mind.
[77:09.06]What did you say?
[77:09.60]I was gonna say, sometimes I think I'm your character.
[77:13.79]Oh.
[77:14.57]Well, yeah.
[77:15.91]It would be easy to mistake.
[77:17.15]Oh, shit.
[77:17.93]I alt-tabbed accidentally.
[77:24.42]Wait, there's a Super Cat.
[77:25.50]This guy's crazy.
[77:27.24]Where is Super Cat?
[77:28.30]Which one is he?
[77:29.69]His head's smoking.
[77:31.97]Are their heads smoking?
[77:32.85]I think that means they're doing magic.
[77:46.50]Are my saws pissing you guys off?
[77:48.67]No, they're great.
[77:50.11]Use them.
[77:52.45]Is that why I said Duskbloods?
[77:55.00]Is that Switch 2 or a Switch regular?
[77:58.62]Switch 2.
[77:59.30]Switch Deluxe.
[78:01.43]When's that coming out?
[78:03.59]No release date as far as I'm aware.
[78:06.59]Wait, is that Switch 2 Pro?
[78:09.42]Yeah, exactly.
[78:13.32]We need a new model of all of our consoles once a year.
[78:18.71]Gotta keep up with technology.
[78:21.16]Yeah.
[78:22.98]Hold the juggle.
[78:27.99]also if you guys want to play anything else after this feel let me know like I'm down I know so we were going to do Mario Party and then I found out the forbidden information that Ster doesn't have a switch I'm sorry it's alright Mario Party dollars no problem I feel like if you buy me one I'll play donkey kong
[78:53.59]Wait, a personal Donkey Kong stream for me?
[78:58.57]Yes.
[78:58.67]It's really good.
[79:02.42]Oh, you know what I need to do?
[79:03.92]I'm going to try to do it Sunday, Jerma.
[79:06.28]That fucking choose your own adventure thing again with the kids who got sucked into the fan in the plane.
[79:12.43]Oh, that thing was so awesome.
[79:13.95]It was so cool.
[79:16.64]I have a better working version of it now.
[79:18.72]Reg figured it out, so I'm going to try it again.
[79:21.82]What are you guys talking about?
[79:24.42]he's got something cool this weird thing from the 90s it was like a choose your own adventure like you know windows movie maker poke yeah it looks like that a little bit and it's just these weird stories and and this one had like a kid getting sucked into a jet engine and dying and it was like supposed to be a kid's story it was like really weird
[79:47.89]So, yeah, no, there's just some bizarro shit that my friend found.
[79:52.46]Did you play as a kid?
[79:53.16]Do you remember, like, old Telltale games?
[79:55.30]It's like Telltale, yeah.
[79:56.28]It's different stories each time.
[79:58.20]There's, like, an Ace Ventura one.
[79:59.97]There's, like, Spider-Man or something like that.
[80:02.85]It's just weird.
[80:03.97]Did you play this as a kid, or you just... Oh, sorry, no, I didn't.
[80:07.49]No, this was just a friend found it.
[80:09.68]Oh.
[80:11.14]Yeah, but were you a kid when your friend found it?
[80:14.04]Yes, I was.
[80:16.02]Blocking?
[80:28.48]When do we get to the big corn boss or whatever it is?
[80:32.30]Isn't that soon?
[80:32.82]I don't have a recollection of the corn boss, but my memory is kind of bad.
[80:39.48]Isn't there a weird corn boss?
[80:42.63]Yeah, I think there might be.
[80:43.93]It's apparently later.
[80:45.09]Yeah.
[80:46.61]Okay, scale from 1 to 10.
[80:47.97]Each of you guys rate your memory.
[80:52.62]How good is your memory?
[80:53.98]It's terrible.
[80:56.18]I'm like a 9.
[81:00.12]I can't forget how good it is.
[81:01.96]I will never let it go.
[81:03.38]That's not funny.
[81:04.48]That's not funny.
[81:05.50]I like it.
[81:05.74]I'll give you like three.
[81:08.09]I'd say mine's probably like a five.
[81:10.09]Five or a six.
[81:12.92]Jeez, mine's like a four.
[81:16.78]Really?
[81:17.04]You give me like a six.
[81:19.89]Maybe a three.
[81:22.45]I get real six memory vibes from you, dude.
[81:24.91]yeah you give me like a high memory vibe like yeah I know that Vinny Vinny forgot that he streamed Dark and Darker with Jerma drama do you remember that no so there you go there's two of us god you guys played that when I don't remember that I think they're lying I think we gotta be fair though Vinny you've been streaming for how long but 14 years 14 or 15 years
[81:54.00]How many games and how many things do you think you have done on your stream?
[82:01.36]Oh, thousands.
[82:03.35]Thousands of things.
[82:04.43]Maybe tens of thousands.
[82:06.17]Tens of thousands.
[82:07.62]Possibly.
[82:08.32]So for you to not remember the 297th thing out of 14,000 things you've done on stream, I don't know.
[82:18.05]I feel like that's fine.
[82:19.81]It was last week.
[82:22.60]That would be a problem.
[82:23.70]That would be bad because I don't remember that either.
[82:26.24]Once in a while... Go ahead.
[82:28.13]No, you go ahead.
[82:29.47]No, you go.
[82:30.43]No, no, I'll talk later.
[82:32.20]Once in a while, someone will submit something for, like, a Sunday stream of mine in, like, a pack or a collection, and I play it for, like, 10 minutes, and then I'm like, wait a minute, why is this vaguely familiar?
[82:43.29]And then my audience is like, oh, yeah, you played this three previous times.
[82:47.02]Yep.
[82:47.92]I've been there before, honestly.
[82:50.18]Wait, so it's not... So it's normal, okay.
[82:52.64]It's normal as a streamer, I hope.
[82:55.46]It's good to hear, honestly.
[82:58.05]Well, also, like, I guess it depends on how much weed you smoked in college.
[83:02.32]do you think about that college or yeah like now like now you literally made a bong for your character I don't know I can't even tell you
[83:16.67]I feel like I've always been this way, but I don't know.
[83:19.29]I'm telling you, it's because I bought, like, weed at the Wendy's, like, when I was 18, and that shit was, like, bad.
[83:27.34]It was, like, bad, like, Wendy's stuff.
[83:29.83]Yeah, that probably gave you perma damage.
[83:31.49]Yeah.
[83:31.97]Yeah, that probably messed with my brain, so I'm still recovering from that.
[83:38.78]I did a lot of Adderall during my Overwatch days, so maybe that fucked with me now, you know?
[83:47.28]Maybe that fucked with my memory.
[83:48.88]Damn, you still didn't make it pro.
[83:51.31]Fuck.
[83:52.03]I didn't want to go pro.
[83:53.01]I stayed as a streamer.
[83:53.79]Okay?
[83:56.05]I chose to be a streamer.
[83:59.12]Okay.
[83:59.64]I didn't know it was recreational for fun Adderall.
[84:03.32]Yeah, to stream fucking 20 hours a day.
[84:04.96]Of course.
[84:06.57]Oh my god, dude.
[84:08.77]I think if I streamed 20 hours a day, I would probably be dead in a month.
[84:14.10]Yeah.
[84:16.20]my longest stream ever is like tears of the kingdom it's like I think eight and a half hours and that's it that was like I've only done two streams that long ever uh so yeah also no one do that at all it's really dumb if you don't need to do it like you're not prescribed or something I like that poke that's my message say that's good you're so brave don't be silly
[84:46.24]Dude, I did a jigsaw puzzle.
[84:47.42]Why do you say it like that?
[84:48.30]I believe it.
[84:50.97]How are you guys at jigsaw puzzles?
[84:52.21]Because people are yelling at me because I took seven hours to do one.
[84:57.81]Uh, I don't even want to try it.
[84:59.65]That's what I think about it.
[85:00.44]Same.
[85:01.70]Somewhere between shit and fucking shit.
[85:05.52]So get off my back, chat.
[85:08.84]GG will do like, spend like 30 hours straight on a puzzle and then just break it right there.
[85:17.39]Is that normal?
[85:19.54]We're not beefy enough to break this door.
[85:26.10]They're laughing at us.
[85:36.01]It did say 10 plus years on the box though, so it's fine.
[85:38.46]That's true.
[85:42.46]Is this DLC?
[85:44.95]no these are modded I remember picking this guy wait actually yeah I keep forgetting that there's random things that you put in the game x's on the ground is that anything flowers
[86:06.14]x's oh no I didn't see it shovel you get later oh it's a blue rock you get a soul heart did you see enter the gungeon two is like 3D wait what there's a two it's making one oh I didn't see that yeah I did I also did not see it
[86:34.98]You know, there's a Katamari coming up.
[86:38.67]I... That, I'm excited for.
[86:41.85]Are you a big Katamari fan?
[86:43.47]Oh, the biggest.
[86:45.46]Wait, there's a new Katamari?
[86:46.56]Yeah.
[86:48.00]With ray tracing?
[86:49.96]Uh, but not if you get it on the Switch.
[86:53.37]Is it coming to everything at once, or...?
[86:56.49]I think a couple things.
[86:57.61]I know the Switch version, they showed some really nasty frame rates.
[87:01.37]Coming to the Switch 1 in PC.
[87:03.22]What a weird...
[87:04.87]Yeah, that's a weird combo.
[87:06.59]And it should be Switch 2 or an enhanced version, but there's no news on that.
[87:10.56]But PC, it'll be good.
[87:12.10]I'm excited.
[87:14.68]Look at me laying down on this thing.
[87:17.65]Goodbye.
[87:18.01]Oh, Poke, your character is wonderful.
[87:28.70]I want to do it.
[87:38.87]Yep, I won.
[87:47.66]Whoa, we're literally crashing our castle.
[87:51.17]Is this Earthworm Jim?
[87:57.94]What is this?
[87:59.60]Yeah.
[88:02.01]Oh, it is.
[88:03.57]With a lightsaber.
[88:09.15]I gotta pee.
[88:10.31]Can we just... Can we just... Go pee.
[88:13.77]Go pee, girl.
[88:17.32]I'm holding it.
[88:18.50]Okay.
[88:19.23]Pie or cake?
[88:20.79]Overall.
[88:21.91]If you had to choose.
[88:22.97]Cake.
[88:23.43]Pie.
[88:27.56]Ster.
[88:29.55]Pie.
[88:30.98]really my guy right there I think if you really extrapolate pie down to its uh actual scientific uh terms then we're also talking pizza pie man we're talking like cheesecake which is I had no I had to wait recently because it's called cheesecake but like wait no wait no I can't get behind that I'm sorry that's cake but it's a it's basically a pie
[88:56.43]no oh wait a minute here no I don't know I don't know if a cheesecake is I think I'm in the pie okay lemon meringue I think think of that think of one of them and now just do it do a cheesecake cheesecake kind of is a pie banana cream pie is my favorite dessert of all time and there's just nothing that can compare to it unfortunately
[89:25.47]Oh no, oh no, oh no.
[89:27.49]Do you guys feel like banana stuff is so hard to find at stores?
[89:31.94]It is.
[89:32.22]Banana stuff is... Like, why do you have everything but banana yogurt?
[89:37.00]It's true.
[89:38.11]It's not that it's hard to find, but I do love it.
[89:42.53]That was not an... Your question was very different.
[89:45.29]But yeah.
[89:47.56]No, why is it hard to find?
[89:49.42]My grocery store just... They don't have enough... Like, they never have banana yogurt.
[89:53.54]Ever.
[89:54.10]Like...
[89:55.71]Alright, well, Ster.
[89:56.51]Ster.
[89:56.83]It's just like a rare thing, I'm telling you.
[89:58.90]Ster, you're... What pie, if you like pie so much, what is the Ster pie?
[90:07.01]Are we allowing pizza?
[90:10.69]No.
[90:11.93]Are we allowing cheesecake?
[90:13.60]No.
[90:14.10]For this argument, no.
[90:15.32]Some really controversial pie takes, maybe.
[90:19.82]I expected nothing less.
[90:21.75]Ster.
[90:23.69]So you put pie over cake, but you can't even name a pie?
[90:27.44]I named two that I believe in my heart are pies.
[90:33.10]Alright, I stepped over on the cake side.
[90:36.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[90:37.29]Isn't there like a shepherd's pie?
[90:40.21]Shepherd's pie, is that a pie?
[90:41.46]Join us.
[90:41.88]Also, can we just, not a savory pie, just for a minute, sir.
[90:46.54]Just pick a sweet pie, please.
[90:48.69]Why do my opinions that are real never count?
[90:52.11]Okay.
[90:52.87]If a shepherd's pie is a pie, it's a pie.
[90:56.81]You twist the truth.
[90:57.27]I got it, buddy.
[90:58.49]I like it too.
[90:59.25]What about a chicken pot pie?
[91:00.97]Why are they all called pies?
[91:02.48]I'm not allowed to like them.
[91:04.64]Name a sweet pie that you like.
[91:11.46]Cheesecake.
[91:12.97]No.
[91:14.43]Okay, that's number one.
[91:15.35]What's number two?
[91:18.47]Um... Eat the dessert if you're hungry.
[91:21.20]Okay, you're good.
[91:23.18]Ster, you need it.
[91:24.23]Eat the cookie.
[91:26.35]Name a pie.
[91:29.60]Apple pie?
[91:30.26]Okay, there it is.
[91:31.50]Okay, good.
[91:32.28]Do you even like apple pie?
[91:34.60]It doesn't sound like he was committed to it.
[91:37.70]what do you mean it's alright I've had some good um what do they call it in Florida it's big the like the key something key pot yeah it's pretty good lime is great I don't know I don't even know the last time I had a cake cake with lemons cake so one-dimensional
[92:00.06]Oh, man.
[92:01.09]That's a good one.
[92:01.95]Okay, as I've gotten older, I'm leaning more towards pie than cake, but I do love a good cake, too.
[92:07.92]It's hard to... Why choose one, right?
[92:10.68]I think cake sucks.
[92:11.56]I'm sorry.
[92:12.34]I just do... Wait, hold on.
[92:15.45]What about dairy cream cake?
[92:18.61]Cake.
[92:19.29]Ice cream cake.
[92:19.77]You know what I'm talking about?
[92:21.21]Like you ever had those as a kid?
[92:22.57]Dairy Queen.
[92:23.35]Yes.
[92:23.55]I had them from Carvel.
[92:24.49]I had them from Carvel.
[92:25.51]Like Fudgy the Whale or something.
[92:26.88]Okay, but is an ice cream cake... Okay, this is going to bounce back to Ster.
[92:30.82]It's ice cream.
[92:31.48]Is an ice cream cake a cake or is it ice cream?
[92:34.20]It's a cake.
[92:35.74]Because that's the Ster argument that he's making about all these things.
[92:38.67]Ice cream cake is like the only kind of cake that I like.
[92:43.25]So if that's the only kind of cake that I like, then you're going to have to have my bullshit pie answers as well.
[92:48.43]Hmm.
[92:51.23]I don't like the regular... It's cake.
[92:57.26]I don't really like it.
[92:58.20]Cake with frosting on it.
[92:59.88]I do like ice cream cake, though.
[93:01.24]I think it's good.
[93:01.62]It's not like I refuse a piece of cake if I'm at a birthday party.
[93:04.79]Oh, yeah, I'll take a piece of cake.
[93:05.79]Whatever.
[93:06.09]Sure.
[93:06.43]Yeah, but you know the pie crust is where it's at.
[93:10.21]I would go ripe with pie.
[93:12.38]Yeah.
[93:13.35]chocolate cream pie banana cream pie um yeah dude pecan pie is is awesome if made right I learned the joys of pecan pie recently oh my god I have not had a good pecan pie that's so fucking good it's like caramel it's amazing I used to hate pumpkin pie and then I had a good one for the first time like two or three years ago whatever it was and I didn't you guys all pick cake
[93:40.42]No, I said pie in the beginning.
[93:43.22]Didn't I make a tweet?
[93:44.68]I thought when I said pie, you all ganged up on me like I was the odd one out.
[93:48.31]No, it's just you were weird about the semantics.
[93:51.29]Guys, what was the pizza?
[93:52.35]Even before I was weird, I felt attacked.
[93:55.33]I'm feeling very attacked today.
[93:57.02]Didn't I make a tweet about how I always said on stream that I hated pumpkin pie and it was disgusting and that I had a good one and I said I wanted to go into a time machine, go back in time and snap that guy's neck and I was talking about me?
[94:10.81]Did I tweet that?
[94:13.43]Did you get in trouble for saying you wanted to snap someone's neck?
[94:16.06]No, no, no.
[94:16.46]I was saying that.
[94:18.30]Guys, guys, guys.
[94:19.06]Vibes are so fucked.
[94:20.24]I have to piss.
[94:21.70]Okay, go pee.
[94:22.29]Go piss, girl.
[94:23.17]No, I've said for years that pumpkin pie was gross.
[94:27.61]And did I make a tweet where I said, guys, I just had pumpkin pie for the first time, a good one, and it was great.
[94:34.24]I want to go back and snap that guy's neck.
[94:36.16]And I was talking about me.
[94:37.79]I go back in time.
[94:39.69]Did I tweet that?
[94:42.87]I don't know all your tweets.
[94:44.94]Someone does.
[94:47.66]Yeah, nice three memory.
[94:54.57]Oh, it was a draft that you said.
[94:56.07]Okay.
[94:57.11]I've got bad takes, but at least I can remember them.
[95:00.36]Oh, shit.
[95:03.02]I kind of feel like it's nice to not remember stuff sometimes.
[95:07.41]Yeah.
[95:08.35]It's helpful.
[95:13.96]that I haven't logged in my Twitter is like from there is a 2023 is last time I haven't used it yeah like did you just kind of stop all social media at that point I never really used it to begin with really I would tweet like once every two or three months
[95:51.30]I mean it's not you're not missing out on much like you you know you're probably doing better in the mental health department so I think that's good yeah I hope poke is just kind of giving us their money up there you know what happens you ask what do you like better pie or cake and then someone's like why do you support
[96:12.13]like um cake killers or something hi a cake killer I don't know what that means like why do you support people that sit on cakes oh I love Earthworm Jim he also he also had a blunt so wait what happened uh who killed the cake that cheesecake is pie
[96:42.74]You guys remember Brazilian cake farts?
[96:48.10]Excuse me?
[96:49.41]You guys have never seen that?
[96:51.19]I don't.
[96:51.51]What are you talking about, man?
[96:53.09]It was like a meme or something back in the day.
[96:55.79]I love how you said the vibes were fucked.
[96:57.88]You left, came back, and started talking about Brazilian cake farting.
[97:02.68]I thought that's what we were talking about.
[97:06.97]Don't look it up, by the way.
[97:07.87]Nobody look it up.
[97:11.07]Don't look it up.
[97:11.79]Well, now I have to.
[97:12.57]Chat, don't look it up.
[97:15.96]It was like the era of like a two girls cup thing.

[97:58.02]Yeah, you can't have a favorite.
[98:00.35]What?
[98:01.03]Favorite.
[98:04.63]I had this conversation about these come up like a week ago randomly, and I've dodged them all.

[98:12.35]You really don't?
[98:13.57]I have seen like one.

[98:23.46]I had to spray on Counter-Strike.
[98:25.72]That was like, honestly, that was like getting Rickrolled back in the day.
[98:29.37]It was just like, oh man, like, yeah, check this out.

[98:34.88]It's got like a secret in it.
[98:36.20]And way to get the whistle.
[98:40.69]Yeah, it was pretty, pretty tough to avoid.
[98:44.25]You don't know about the dude with the hands that open up the portal, Ster?
[98:48.50]Oh, yeah.
[98:50.75]You know about that one, right?
[98:52.67]I know of it, but I really haven't seen them, though.

[99:04.83]Nothing, nothing.
[99:06.35]Okay.
[99:07.99]Vibes are rancid.
[99:09.90]I actually don't think they are.
[99:12.14]I think the vibes are fine.
[99:14.24]We're just discussing human experience.
[99:19.67]There's a lot of terrible, like, we already, they're all terrible.
[99:24.97]They're all pretty bad.

[100:15.28]Okay, I've looked at everything, but there's one I've heard of that I would refuse to go.
[100:19.57]And I knew how bad it was, but I won't say it out loud.
[100:22.27]Okay.
[100:23.39]Yeah, we'll have to confer in private.

[101:23.41]Talking about like...
[101:25.00]That joke I was saying.
[101:26.55]It's a normal thing.
[101:28.03]Okay, we all died, but you, Poke, how?

[102:16.12]So it was forbidden.
[102:17.96]It's forbidden.

[104:12.94]On stream?
[104:13.48]No.
[104:14.53]We want to do an unction in the real life.
[104:18.03]Yeah, but we never said we were going to do it in real life.
[104:21.00]Well, we're going to do it.
[104:22.02]We want to, you know.
[104:24.34]But there has to be a segment where we play poker, and I'm not kidding.
[104:28.71]I want a table.
[104:29.93]Wherever we are, we'll get us a nice table with poker chips and cards and cigars.
[104:37.20]And I don't want anyone to fucking talk.
[104:39.34]We're just gonna smoke cigars and just grunt and shit.
[104:41.62]I don't know where I am.
[104:43.46]We're gonna lose.
[104:47.47]Can I smoke and cough?
[104:50.75]You might have to.
[104:53.38]That's fine.
[104:55.54]By the way, the first person that laughs during this has to leave.
[104:59.16]You're out.
[105:01.79]Fuck.
[105:02.29]I would be so done.
[105:03.95]I would be so done so quickly.
[105:05.87]We're playing poker and we're putting money in.
[105:08.29]And if you laugh, you're out.
[105:09.43]You gotta leave.
[105:10.16]And it's just the rest of us are there with the money in.
[105:12.40]You forfeit all your cards in your pot.
[105:15.48]Because, Jerm, I had a good idea for the unction as well.
[105:20.61]Pain roulette.
[105:23.38]Is that another one of these websites?
[105:25.38]It is.
[105:25.88]Yeah.
[105:27.56]I was going to say, that segment into that is kind of like, Vinny, I don't know if we can do that on stream.
[105:35.85]What's Pain Roulette?
[105:37.49]I'm not going to say.
[105:38.76]I don't know.
[105:39.20]I don't know.
[105:40.68]I just like the name.
[105:42.16]I like the name.
[105:43.34]You hurt me, I hurt you, and then, like, I don't know.
[105:47.32]What do you envision when you think about Pain Roulette?
[105:51.07]I'm thinking...
[105:53.32]there's a roulette wheel and there are pain options and you have to bet on if your ball lands on the options ball pain I don't know what I'm gonna have to workshop this okay I'm gonna workshop it are you allowed to like kill people on stream
[106:16.03]Well, each of us is going to get what we want in the function.
[106:21.30]So there's going to be four separate sets that we're going to work on.
[106:26.01]Everybody gets a set.
[106:27.25]I already told you what mine was.
[106:31.28]Mine is what I just told you.
[106:33.88]And also... So yours is like a challenge.
[106:36.31]Yeah, but we're going to actually play poker for real.
[106:39.93]We're going to have a dealer doing it too.
[106:41.31]A dealer's going to be just stone cold serious the whole time.
[106:44.53]And we're smoking cigars and we're just going to be just kind of hanging out, just fucking drinking whiskey and smoking cigars.
[106:48.93]And you don't say hit or hold, right?
[106:51.58]You have to say, you have to tap the table, right?
[106:54.66]Or wave your hand, like that kind of shit?
[106:57.00]You could, you know, very minimal speaking.
[107:00.68]Okay.
[107:01.95]What if I've never played poker?
[107:06.13]We're going to play Texas Hold'em, so it's easy.
[107:07.81]Okay, I'll learn, I'll learn.
[107:10.37]I'll train.
[107:13.45]Alright, Ster, what is your unction set going to be?
[107:17.96]I don't know.
[107:18.24]I have to think really hard about it.
[107:19.92]This guy's going to bring a fucking shepherd's pie.
[107:23.54]Pie making competition.
[107:25.12]Ster.
[107:27.83]If you only get one, I have to choose the right one.
[107:33.75]I also want to break geodes too.
[107:35.90]Geodes is like a bonus one.
[107:38.70]Oh, so he gets two.
[107:39.94]Everyone gets two all of a sudden.
[107:41.30]This is a bonus one.
[107:42.61]This is a bonus.
[107:45.15]I want to.
[107:45.73]Here's what I want to do in my segment.
[107:47.79]I want to play.
[107:49.03]I want us to start a band like a fake band.
[107:51.72]We have a fake band name.
[107:54.50]We play a couple songs live.
[107:57.66]Okay.
[107:58.09]Do you guys play any instruments?
[108:00.15]I know you do poke a little bit like you play keyboard and stuff, right?
[108:04.07]I mean, I only know the Mario song and like Zelda.
[108:07.76]I think you could teach me a really basic like guitar bassline or something and I could just... And Tetris.
[108:14.47]At best do that.
[108:15.57]I could do the drums.
[108:17.06]You play drums, Jerma?
[108:18.12]I actually... Like very rudimentarily.
[108:22.03]I said that word wrong, but I kind of.
[108:24.71]Okay, if drums is like a video game, I got like past the tutorial and I'm on like the first or second bus.
[108:31.13]Okay, we can keep it simple.
[108:32.73]We can cover a song or we write one together.
[108:35.16]I hope we get you on keyboard.
[108:36.68]Ster.
[108:37.46]Ster, have you played bass before?
[108:38.68]Uh, no.
[108:41.73]Oh.
[108:42.61]You think we should do things that we don't do?
[108:44.11]Like, usually, like, Vinny, I feel like if you didn't vocals, it would just be the number one song of all time, but I feel like we should make it a challenge and say, Ster is vocals.
[108:55.89]Oh, man.
[108:57.66]No.
[108:58.12]You know what I'm saying?
[108:59.28]That's kind of crazy.
[109:00.52]I could do that.
[109:00.86]I'll play his guitar or something.
[109:02.16]Sure.
[109:03.69]Oh, wait.
[109:04.21]Oh, same idea, but this time Jerma is vocals.
[109:09.25]No, I would have too much.
[109:10.11]I would have too much fun.
[109:11.63]Oh, yeah.
[109:12.23]Still not a good idea now.
[109:13.71]I would have too much fun.
[109:14.62]I would actually have too much fun, and that would be going against the spirit of the game.
[109:20.62]Literally, the band could just be called Unction.
[109:23.94]Wait, why?
[109:24.72]We're not supposed to have fun?
[109:27.58]yeah what like well I mean my other idea was it listen guys it's this or pain roulette so yeah alright we're doing the song we're not doing the pain um thing pain roulette god wait what are you doing for the band Vinny I'm doing whatever you guys need me to do all of it no no no I'll play the guitar I'll play the little rhythm guitar and you know I'll do background vocals
[109:56.67]Can we get an electric piano?
[109:57.83]And a harmonica.
[109:59.97]Like something extra also.
[110:01.62]You need like something crazy extra.
[110:03.62]Yeah, we'll just, I'll, you know, I'll help us write a song and then we'll do it together.
[110:07.84]You know, we'll all write a song together.
[110:09.84]That sounds fun.
[110:10.65]I actually think that'd be a lot of fun.
[110:12.63]Yeah, I can do piano.
[110:14.45]Or... Yeah, dude.
[110:17.51]Kazoo?
[110:18.37]Piano?
[110:19.03]You could do both because you have free limbs.
[110:24.03]I'll do it.
[110:26.53]We'll make art.
[110:27.41]Okay, so is that Vinny's?
[110:30.03]That's your unction?
[110:31.14]That's mine.
[110:31.62]Mine is music.
[110:33.30]Yeah, I would love to just play, you know, hang out, play some music, jam a little bit.
[110:36.79]I mean, that's kind of what I just like doing that.
[110:38.95]I think it'll be fun to do it with some rudimentary musicians that we'll just like, you know, we'll just fucking play.
[110:48.12]We'll just fucking play.
[110:49.57]How are we going to get these people to watch us?
[110:53.25]anybody to watch the stream?
[110:54.66]Oh, are you doing a stream or a real crowd?
[111:00.10]Are you going to go to a bar?
[111:01.56]I don't think a real crowd would want to watch us learn to play instruments before.
[111:05.55]No, no, no, no.
[111:06.35]We do that together, just hanging out.
[111:09.49]Okay.
[111:10.61]Yeah.
[111:12.40]I feel like if we had a crowd of people and we just performed a song with no prior practice, that would be good.
[111:20.79]That would be funny, but it would be horrendous.
[111:23.63]I mean, I... I don't know.
[111:25.77]I feel like he'd be good.
[111:27.39]Polk, what do you got?
[111:28.25]What's going on with you?
[111:30.00]I think we got two good ones going on here.
[111:32.04]I think we got... My unction.
[111:38.17]Um... I think... No pressure.
[111:45.10]I mean, this is not happening for a while, so... Sir, can you go first?
[111:50.82]No.
[111:53.45]Can you go before me?
[111:57.57]I don't know.
[111:58.11]I don't know if we're doing... If Vinny is making everyone play music, then I make everyone play ping pong because we have to do stuff that, like, you're good at already and that, like, everyone else is bad at.
[112:06.88]And then you, like, win your segment.
[112:10.40]It doesn't... Wait, there's no winning.
[112:13.89]Yeah, there is no winning segments.
[112:15.47]I don't think there's winning, I think, but, like, it's, you know, we're just hanging out and doing stuff that we like to do and we're, you know...
[112:24.92]It's like something you wish you did with your friends.
[112:32.33]I mean, I would like to play ping pong.
[112:33.96]I just don't know what I would want.
[112:35.58]Yeah, okay, then we have to do that.
[112:36.88]Alright, we'll play ping pong for you.
[112:39.57]Ping pong with Ster and ping bong with poke.
[112:44.08]For me, it would be like
[112:48.27]something I've always want to do with people that they never want to do with me let's think let's think kiss like how we do we've come it's like arbitrary rules for coming up with our segment yeah it doesn't okay it doesn't have like a land party oh lamb party would be fun oh something that we can't do online yeah okay I like it
[113:17.28]get some like four player uh kind of couch co-op games that just cannot be played we always game so maybe something different say like a physical game in in like person like ping pong or something maybe that's yeah we'll do ping pong for you I thought that was a big opportunity I I don't want to ruin this I gotta think of something good see exactly I want to I want to get a good one there's no rush oh she's like board games you know what I mean like play board games are magically gathering or something
[113:47.27]Fuck around.
[113:48.43]Whatever, bro.
[113:49.39]Oh, Vinny, you want revenge?
[113:51.27]I have saws.
[113:52.79]Oh, I'm dead.
[113:58.84]Okay.
[113:58.96]Why is he coming for me?
[114:00.64]I don't know.
[114:02.67]Oh, he's an archer.
[114:05.91]I'm PvP build.
[114:11.92]Ow.
[114:12.24]Ow.

[114:22.25]I'm alive.
[114:28.01]He drank his potion, dude.
[114:29.53]Can we get a pool and just go swimming?
[114:31.04]Oh!
[114:33.58]What the heck?
[114:33.96]Does that want damage?
[114:34.60]See ya.
[114:37.54]What if we just went swimming?
[114:39.83]Oh, what the hell?
[114:42.07]I actually like that.
[114:42.83]We just go swimming.
[114:46.03]You see?
[114:46.43]Yes, you're kissing.
[114:48.85]yeah whoa oh wow beach episode a beach a beach episode would be fun just to just lay in a lounge chair dude hell yeah an escape room
[115:14.71]A really bad escape room.
[115:17.48]Like, the worst escape room ever.
[115:19.60]I mean, I like how these ideas are ballooning into these, like, large segments.
[115:24.61]But... Maybe there's, like, some company you could hire to just make a shitty escape room.
[115:32.35]It's got to exist somewhere.
[115:34.04]Do you guys want to keep playing this, or do you want to do something else?
[115:36.86]It's a kennel.
[115:38.96]What are you thinking?
[115:40.02]I just want to vibe check.
[115:41.78]Vibe check?
[115:42.46]I'm doing okay.
[115:43.91]We're just kind of talking, just hanging out.
[115:46.51]I'm having fun.
[115:48.03]What else did we suggest, though?
[115:48.99]What games?
[115:50.10]Yeah, who knows?
[115:51.52]We got some bugs, the bug game.
[115:55.10]What's the bug game?
[115:56.33]That new, what, Phantom?
[115:58.53]Looks like it's a Phantom Squad or something.
[116:02.24]I think we're in a talky mood.
[116:03.60]We should just keep going.
[116:05.12]Rather than learn something new.
[116:10.22]oh yeah the bug was spider world horror thing let me let me just take a quick look at that how about straff tat I'm down for that I feel like I'd be they got 2v2 now uh I'm down and it sounds amazing the one issue I have is I'm currently sitting on a couch and I'm gonna have to put a keyboard on my lap gamer
[116:35.39]I'm just curious, but I'm down to play more of this.
[116:37.46]I just want to see, what's the name of the spider game?
[116:40.32]Um, it's, you scroll up a little bit.
[116:44.90]Odd Remedy.
[116:46.59]Oh, that one, yeah.
[116:47.55]Alright, while you guys discuss, I have to pee.
[116:50.63]I'm prepared.
[116:52.11]Alright.
[116:52.45]What is this game?
[116:53.23]Is it good?
[116:54.24]I gotta pee.
[116:54.70]I was gonna leave them open.
[116:55.86]You can just listen to them discuss.
[116:56.92]You gotta escape the island and there's spiders everywhere trying to get you.
[117:03.98]Yeah, I mean, it's up to you guys, really.
[117:08.02]I mean, I'm down.
[117:08.66]I just don't want Jerma to feel like he has to get up off his couch, you know?
[117:17.19]Phasmophobia?
[117:20.37]I haven't played that in a while.
[117:22.12]I haven't played it since it came out.
[117:23.56]I wonder what's different.
[117:25.46]I heard some got a little worse in some ways, and then better in other ways.
[117:30.40]I don't know.
[117:32.63]I played it with Jerma, like,
[117:34.95]I think around the Halloween thing they had, probably.
[117:38.95]Okay, it looks like I last booted it up 2022.
[117:41.77]Jesus.
[117:42.93]Really?
[117:43.31]Yeah.
[117:44.54]Oh, wow.
[117:47.04]Yeah, it's been a while.
[117:49.72]I fucking love that game, but it also scared the shit out of me so bad in VR that I had to take the headset off.
[117:56.97]It's like the worst time that ever happened.
[118:00.97]It was one of the greatest VR experiences back in the day.
[118:06.57]You know what one I think you might like, Poke?
[118:08.51]Have you heard of Cosmodread?
[118:10.75]Did we talk about this?
[118:12.19]No.
[118:13.56]It's a horror roguelite shoot game on a fucking horror space ship, like Dead Space.
[118:21.08]It's really, really good and scary.
[118:23.80]Yeah, if it's single-player VR scary, yeah, no thanks.
[118:28.07]Yeah, I'm freaking out.
[118:30.65]I can't do single-player VR.
[118:32.03]I can't do it.
[118:32.91]Like, single-player scary games?
[118:34.11]No.
[118:35.11]For VR?
[118:35.82]Oh, yeah, no.
[118:37.38]I need like a friend there or something.
[118:41.79]That'd be my unction room.
[118:42.93]I play a scary game and you guys just all watch me.
[118:46.28]The unction room.
[118:57.05]Long drive.
[118:59.86]New repo update.
[119:01.22]Oh, you know what?
[119:02.86]Wasn't there a game that was like The Long Drive?
[119:04.88]There was like a clone of it.
[119:06.32]What was that one?
[119:09.03]Something Horizon?
[119:10.87]Yeah, Horizon.
[119:12.37]Drive Beyond Horizon's demo.
[119:15.49]Yeah, I'm not dropping 24 bucks on that.
[119:24.47]Not now.
[119:25.21]Maybe in the future.
[119:34.88]Drive Beyond...
[119:37.73]horizons was amazing it's just late for me and I'll follow you guys off a cliff if that's what we decide yeah sorry I know this is like kind of not your normal streaming time what time do you go to bed usually Ster um ideally no later than 1 a.m I was up till 7 a.m the other day that was fun
[120:04.26]you were up until 7am yeah that's crazy I think last night I went to bed at midnight which would be two hours from now so you're just literally all over the place usually I'm pretty consistent but recently I got a little glorped up yeah the works are glorped I got it hey hello so are we sticking around here or how we doing
[120:34.06]No decisions were really made.
[120:36.74]Okay.
[120:37.90]Yeah.
[120:40.29]I think we were fine here until Vinny said, like, wink, like, maybe we could do something else, like, wink, but I'm fine here, wink.
[120:49.56]I just was asking, but I'm down to play more of this.
[120:52.36]Here, look, I'll even, as a sign of good faith, let us continue.
[120:59.51]Oh, wait, I have to go back to the map.
[121:00.70]Hang on.
[121:03.30]I think it's time to switch our weapons.
[121:07.11]I like Castle Crashers.
[121:13.20]I'm vibing.
[121:14.90]We should do a road trip stream.
[121:19.41]Can we get an RV?
[121:24.62]A gaming RV.
[121:25.80]No, I can't.
[121:27.86]I couldn't.
[121:29.78]I'm sorry.
[121:31.25]If we all had separate RVs for each of us, I could do that.
[121:37.94]Pretty funny.
[121:42.26]Okay, that's the limit.
[121:43.55]Some of us are level 10.
[121:44.67]Pope, you could get a new weapon if you wanted to.
[121:49.01]I think the pencil's OP.
[121:50.48]Yeah, pencil is kind of broken.
[121:51.56]I've never got a level 5 weapon.
[121:54.28]let's see how what is that plus seven man that's crazy it's too good to take off alright I'm using the pencil god damn was there a big like uh weapon damage strength not really look at this guy he picked strength
[122:21.21]no I've been leveling agility which was like the joke stat I think actually it's pretty good late game okay because you shot me with one rainbow and it did 90 damage or so well you got hit by like five ticks of rainbow okay so I can only hit one enemy at a time with one arrow for 10 damage okay are you gonna complain about it or what no I'm just saying that your math's a little off if you think it's good
[122:53.39]Oh, there's a big strength weapon, but you lose agility.
[123:00.06]There's a sandwich right here.
[123:01.76]We were talking, Jerma, that game Drive Beyond Horizons.
[123:04.94]Remember the one that was removed?
[123:06.97]Oh, yeah.
[123:08.33]Apparently, my chat was saying it's awesome.
[123:10.59]So for a future potential, if you're looking to drive.
[123:13.95]I love that.
[123:15.16]Only if we all have separate cars.
[123:17.88]Only, yeah.
[123:20.90]No, Jerma, honestly, dude, when it comes to sharing a hotel room even, sucks.
[123:26.23]I have a hard time sleeping.
[123:28.31]So, I know how you feel.
[123:29.57]Like, it's just, yeah, you need your own space.
[123:31.62]I get it.
[123:32.32]There's been a lot of cases.
[123:33.70]I'm sure you probably have this too.
[123:35.02]I don't know.
[123:35.52]The four of us can probably chime in on this.
[123:37.33]We're like, oh, man, it'd be awesome.
[123:38.69]Yeah, we could all be in a hotel room together.
[123:40.23]And I'm just like, I would like my own room.
[123:45.01]We did that with the band.
[123:46.90]We had to share two rooms between five band members at MAGFest this year.
[123:52.04]It was rough.
[123:52.86]You know, we all get along great.
[123:54.67]It was nice, but it was just sleeping-wise, it was like, uh... Yeah, it doesn't matter what the scenario is.
[124:02.80]Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[124:04.64]One of them's a snorer.
[124:06.20]Somebody snores every time.
[124:10.37]Someone farts.
[124:11.53]That's me.
[124:12.13]A lot.
[124:13.43]No, I snore a lot.
[124:15.66]Oh, not the fart one.
[124:16.38]It's random.
[124:18.64]I fart too, but... By choice.
[124:24.75]I fart by choice.
[124:26.31]Like, you get up in the middle of the night, you're like, I'm doing this because I want to, not because I have to.
[124:33.60]Yeah, I'm not one of those, like... No, let me explain.
[124:36.83]Like, it's 5 a.m., I'm sleeping.
[124:39.27]Like, out of my ass, out of nowhere.
[124:40.85]It doesn't happen.
[124:41.37]Hear me out.
[124:43.77]You know, I don't fart for no reason.
[124:45.56]Right, right.
[124:48.14]I love that.
[124:48.84]I don't fart for no... It's almost like it's your using it as... On my terms.
[124:54.82]Yeah, on your own terms.
[124:55.85]Almost as a means to communicate.
[124:57.61]Deterministic farting.
[125:03.79]It's not even the right use of that word, I don't think, but it's cool.
[125:07.28]I swear I have, like, I just started farting after 25.
[125:11.92]Wait, did you, how did, what happened before then?
[125:14.38]Did it all like exit as a fart?
[125:15.50]I used to never fart, but like now it's like a, it's like I just do like the farts like in cartoons and shit.
[125:21.15]Like it just happens.
[125:22.29]It really does.
[125:22.61]You know what that is?
[125:23.23]That's, that's like your gut biome changing where you used to, like, I used to be able to eat like, like raw mayonnaise and like chicken nuggies and like shit, not mayonnaise.
[125:32.92]Raw mayonnaise?
[125:34.93]I didn't mean raw, raw nuggies?
[125:36.63]Did you cook your mayonnaise?
[125:37.85]You fry your mayonnaise?
[125:39.75]So, I used to be able to eat a lot of junk, no problem, but yeah, your gut biome changes.
[125:46.00]You gotta keep an eye on that.
[125:47.36]Probiotics and shit.
[125:48.66]I take a probiotic every day.
[125:53.75]Maybe that's it, Poke?
[125:54.61]Maybe you need to, like... Oh my god!
[125:57.74]What the fuck?
[125:58.52]Dude, look at Vinny!
[125:59.84]Next sandwich, let me have it, because I drew a whole character with the sandwich mode, too.
[126:05.05]Oh, you did?
[126:06.05]Yes!
[126:07.44]Oh man, I got to see that.
[126:08.86]Definitely.
[126:09.36]Yeah, I want to see that so bad.
[126:12.88]No, I don't fart.
[126:13.91]I only fart in bed.
[126:14.99]I think it's when I lay down.
[126:16.01]Oh, sandwich.
[126:16.97]Oh, shit.
[126:17.41]How do I drop it?
[126:19.35]I don't think you can.
[126:20.43]Damn it.
[126:20.81]I didn't want it.
[126:22.73]I guess just eat it.
[126:25.40]You know, when you... Wow, that skin didn't even change the arms.
[126:31.64]That's the default arms.
[126:32.84]Wow.
[126:33.44]Buff Miku.
[126:36.90]I'm dead.
[126:37.44]I'm a dead person.
[126:40.25]Yeah, me too.
[126:41.75]You could keep letting those enemies drop to farm sandwiches.
[126:45.64]Oh my goodness.
[126:46.50]I'd love to fucking revive you.
[126:48.00]Oh, we might have talked about this.
[126:50.06]Have we talked about sandwich order?
[126:51.44]Like, what's your favorite?
[126:52.54]Like, what's your go-to?
[126:53.63]We'll be here for a week.
[126:56.21]Okay, yeah.
[126:57.01]Yeah, we do tend to talk about food a bit.
[126:59.49]But, oh man, oh man.
[127:01.30]What day is it?
[127:02.60]Bread, cheese, meat.
[127:05.98]That's me.
[127:06.87]Give me pastrami.
[127:07.94]Give me pastrami with, like, two or three lines of just yellow mustard on it.
[127:13.83]Swiss cheese.
[127:14.89]Boom.
[127:16.03]Are you coming to get me?
[127:17.71]No.
[127:17.79]Where are you?
[127:20.04]No, I was checking to see if that dude spawned for the sandwich, but no.
[127:22.82]Okay.
[127:23.44]What's your Subway order?
[127:26.91]You know what I like?
[127:27.55]I order it out of my life.
[127:30.41]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[127:33.77]Jersey Mike's is so much better than Subway anyway, fuck.
[127:37.66]Yeah, but like, come on, we all loved Subway back in the day though, right?
[127:41.01]We did.
[127:42.19]I still have an order.
[127:43.47]I like the Italian on flatbread with like black olives and like pickles and onion.
[127:50.44]and lettuce tomato and I like their the vinaigrette I've had a like a dispute with subway that they've made me angry ever since one time I went in and you know like oh we build your own sandwich I was just like I pointed up to the sandwich I said oh give me like the philly cheese steak and they're like oh well what do you want on it you want cheese I was like with a philly cheese steak what and I just have been mad for like 10 years and I hate them oh man
[128:18.22]You can't hold on to that anymore, buddy.
[128:20.22]I'll help you let go of that.
[128:21.81]No, but you're right.
[128:22.43]We'll get you a good sandwich.
[128:24.27]We'll go to Philly.
[128:25.17]Come hang out.
[128:25.75]We'll do an unction in Philly.
[128:26.79]I'll get you a real Philly cheesesteak.
[128:28.24]Oh, my God, Vinny.
[128:29.48]I've never had a real one.
[128:31.60]I heard that if you want a real Philly cheesesteak, the worst place to get it is Philly.
[128:37.05]That's bullshit.
[128:37.77]There's so many people making them that it's harder to find the good one.
[128:41.68]You know what I mean?
[128:42.40]Like a saturated market.
[128:44.80]Yeah, sure, but they're still good.
[128:47.08]Yeah, but if you're in some other place and you're like, oh, we have a good Philly cheesesteak, you better have a really good one.
[128:52.51]Yeah, that's because you didn't go to Pat's.
[128:55.27]Or Gino's.
[128:56.57]Actually, those are the two that I try not to go to anymore, but they're still good.
[129:01.00]But I got a good three, four locations that are fucking awesome.
[129:05.80]What the fuck is that?
[129:07.11]From Smiling Friends.
[129:08.87]He kind of belongs in this universe, doesn't he?
[129:11.49]Yes.
[129:12.17]Newgrounds.
[129:12.89]You're the fuck out of me.
[129:14.72]I mean, this is where those guys started, isn't it?
[129:18.86]This is like a lot of the, yeah, that fits here.
[129:21.71]Ed McMillan and all that.
[129:24.21]This isn't Ed McMillan, but I think he's the blacksmith.
[129:29.76]How do I do my new combo?
[129:31.04]X, X, X, Y?
[129:32.34]We're supposed to... Dude, sir, sir, watch this damage.
[129:35.35]Ready?
[129:36.63]Sir, look at me.
[129:37.79]Watching.
[129:40.07]Oh, okay, good.
[129:41.79]I mean, still, one of those is five times me shooting arrows.
[129:45.91]They're just getting overkilled, but yeah.
[129:47.65]49 per hit.
[129:49.37]Let me take a look and see what I got on there, too.
[129:51.03]Mine's like 30-something.
[129:55.06]Oh, we're doing good.
[129:56.84]Do some damage.
[129:58.52]Yeah, 40.
[130:04.69]I'm dead.
[130:08.35]I heard RB's got the good fillies.
[130:12.53]If you want a true Philly cheesesteak.
[130:15.98]I have no Arby's near me in New York that I'm aware of.
[130:20.10]It's green peppers on a Philly cheesesteak, right?
[130:22.79]Get out of here.
[130:23.81]Onions.
[130:24.27]I just do onions.
[130:25.17]Onion.
[130:25.71]Onion only.
[130:26.63]No icon on my body.
[130:27.54]I'm just dead, right?
[130:28.54]Isn't it both?
[130:29.24]Isn't it onions and green peppers?
[130:32.18]Or am I?
[130:32.52]I don't even know.
[130:33.60]You could do that.
[130:34.21]Yeah, sure.
[130:34.81]Oh, what the hell?
[130:35.37]You have options.
[130:39.80]but I mean for me like in the to me the classic you know the cheese whiz and all that that's great but you'll like you have to go to the bathroom in an hour well you gotta go sometime I like provolone on my cheesesteak onions provolone that's good enough for me that's good stuff I just stole the food where is where's Ster he left
[131:05.87]Is there no way to get him back, chat?
[131:08.22]I died in the beginning, and you guys just kept going.
[131:11.30]Wait, what?
[131:11.56]And I just didn't say anything about it.
[131:13.20]We just didn't give a fuck.
[131:13.88]I keep dying.
[131:14.60]Man, I'm so sorry, guys.
[131:16.10]I keep dying.
[131:18.45]Should we just go back?
[131:23.51]I also do need to say, if we had like 40 revives in this game so far, I have 38 of them.
[131:31.06]Yeah, pretty much.
[131:33.08]no I died the most 40 deaths I've had 36 of them dysfunction at the unction that's pretty funny poor Ster though his corpse rotten he doesn't get to fight the cool enemy gone if you guys think about it we're the first unks ever ever ever what do you what does that mean I don't know I just like being the first I don't know
[132:04.33]How do we do damage to this thing?
[132:07.59]Do we have to like knock it back in?
[132:08.72]I might need a sandwich.
[132:12.98]Oh, okay.
[132:17.21]Really dude?
[132:18.71]I know.
[132:18.95]I want to see Poke's skin.
[132:19.99]He worked hard to make it himself.
[132:24.60]And I worked hard to ask a chat member to make me a skin.
[132:27.84]Let's go.
[132:28.22]Oh guys, look.
[132:28.83]Ready?
[132:29.79]Yeah.
[132:30.51]How do I eat it?
[132:31.85]Crispy.
[132:35.35]So bad.
[132:38.95]What?
[132:39.55]Pretty bad.
[132:40.15]Look at this.
[132:42.10]Dude, that's crazy.
[132:48.59]It looks like home movies.
[132:51.25]It does look like home movies.
[132:52.95]Another sandwich.
[132:57.70]Who's hungry?
[132:59.51]me you you have a you have two of them just keep eating them poke and keep killing the um the volcano oh uh you're also the only one alive yeah I can res oh hey Ster is back well on the right side yeah exactly yeah the sandwich does not help me because I do no damage I can't even cast spells
[133:30.22]I think we can uh we gotta do the whole lava world again alright what you're putting on your Five Guys burger order I don't know one patty because I don't like two patties on a burger I know people are gonna say bullshit no no that's exactly how you should be eating a burger good man
[133:54.20]Thank you.
[133:54.76]I just don't like two patties.
[133:57.01]One patty's good.
[133:58.25]It messes the ratio up.
[133:59.65]I don't usually get a double.
[134:00.87]Wait, wait, wait.
[134:01.87]You're anti-double?
[134:03.59]Anti-double.
[134:04.11]Yeah.
[134:05.48]Sometimes, like 90% of the time, it just ruins it, in my opinion.
[134:10.50]What?
[134:10.90]Yep.
[134:11.24]Double cheeseburgers is the ratio.
[134:13.81]The ratio should be... Go ahead.
[134:17.49]Defend.
[134:21.24]Do I need to?
[134:22.72]I just feel like at that point you're having, like, bread.
[134:26.12]What?
[134:28.33]Like, it's a cheeseburger.
[134:29.87]You better put some burger in it.
[134:33.49]But it got burger.
[134:34.55]It's there.
[134:37.41]Not enough.
[134:37.89]I think patties are too big.
[134:41.40]We're talking, like, fast food kind of burgers that are, like, really thin to begin with.
[134:45.16]We're not talking, like, restaurant, like, this is, like, an inch thick juicer.
[134:49.85]I actually hate those.
[134:50.77]I think those are a fucking disgrace.
[134:53.53]Which ones do you hate?
[134:54.88]The big thick ones?
[134:55.90]The Juicy Juice Man!
[134:58.52]It's a 25-pound fucking patty, and it's got... it's got Omega Sauce on it, and we make our own Omega Sauce in-house.
[135:07.47]And it's got triple onions, and it's got six patties, and by the way, this weighs your stomach down like a fucking cow.
[135:14.60]Yeah.
[135:15.44]I died in one hit.
[135:16.34]What is happening?
[135:17.90]Yeah, they're hard.
[135:18.90]We haven't been leveling defense, I don't think.
[135:22.24]Oh, by the way, it's medium rare and it's rare and it's good.
[135:27.52]I have a couple good places for burgers that do, you know, all that stuff.
[135:32.61]That's like a good piece of meat that's really fucking awesome.
[135:35.93]And it's like you just get one.
[135:37.66]One patty, you get the burger the way they want to make it, and it's awesome.
[135:41.86]There's a place also called Hamburger America.
[135:43.98]And the dude, George Motz, makes these smash burgers.
[135:49.01]And I got a double one time.
[135:51.38]and it left me feeling kind of gross.
[135:54.43]But every time I go there and I get a single, I feel great.
[135:59.25]Single plus the prize, no problem.
[136:02.92]Double, I feel sick.
[136:06.48]Yeah, it's too much.
[136:08.69]What do you think about that, Ster?
[136:10.21]I would rather have two singles than one double cheeseburger.
[136:13.51]That's what I'm saying.
[136:14.39]Well, Jerma, what is going with the single?
[136:17.20]Boom.
[136:18.80]Bingo.
[136:19.20]Listen to this.
[136:19.58]What else is on it?
[136:21.39]Two different kinds of, we're talking Five Guys.
[136:23.31]This is the Five Guys order, if you're either one of these.
[136:27.59]Grilled onions.
[136:30.48]Chopped up grilled onions too, by the way.
[136:34.76]Jalapeños.
[136:36.62]Boom.
[136:39.53]Cheese.
[136:41.47]And a little bit of A1 sauce.
[136:43.89]Hmm.
[136:44.85]Yeah, man, I think you want a salad.
[136:46.20]I don't think you want the burger.
[136:48.82]No, I'm telling you, that is a good combo.
[136:50.87]That is the burger that I order from Five Guys.
[136:55.17]And I know everyone's like, oh, A1, oh my god, what an idiot, he sucks, he likes A1, what a stupid asshole.
[137:00.74]That's fairly common.
[137:01.90]A1?
[137:02.63]I don't put A1 on a steak, I put A1 on a burger.
[137:07.25]Uh, not for me, but I respect the hustle.
[137:13.76]You had me up until then, though, you know?
[137:15.83]Like, I need the Omega sauce, Jerma, I'm sorry.
[137:19.00]You could put some mayo on it, too, if you wanted to.
[137:20.84]But honestly, the A1 is not even... I don't even love A1.
[137:23.54]I don't really like it.
[137:25.64]But on a burger with that combination, it gives it a little bit of tartness.
[137:30.53]You get the heat from the jalapeño, and then you get the tartness kick from the A1.
[137:34.45]The grilled onions bring the whole thing together at the end.
[137:37.04]You end up tasting grilled onion after you get hit by the tartness.
[137:41.14]Well, I'm sorry.
[137:41.70]Does anybody have a burger that they would like to talk about, too?
[137:45.92]We should do some cooking at the unction.
[137:48.78]Yeah, honestly.
[137:50.26]We should cook.
[137:51.49]Food is such a great universal topic.
[137:53.45]I mean, it just makes people hungry at like fucking 2 in the morning, but other than that... I got one shot again.
[137:59.62]89 damage.
[138:02.20]Yeah, they're tough.
[138:08.33]I'm gonna say something crazy and change all your lives.
[138:14.20]Okay.
[138:14.32]You ready?
[138:15.00]He knows the activation code?
[138:17.54]You guys need to try watermelon with cheese.
[138:22.61]Hmm.
[138:24.51]Okay.
[138:25.53]It's just... There's a specific cheese, too.
[138:28.12]It is so... People are gonna... It just sounds bad, but it is so good.
[138:36.01]What kind of cheese is it?
[138:37.89]Um...
[138:39.47]I think it's feta.
[138:41.52]I think feta cheese.
[138:43.58]Oh, okay.
[138:43.80]That makes sense.
[138:44.58]It's like a Greek salad kind of thing.
[138:45.98]Feta cheese is good.
[138:46.86]Honestly, bro, a lot of cheeses can work with it.
[138:50.71]That's what I'm saying.
[138:51.41]I tried it with some cheese, like those cheese strings ones.
[138:54.45]Mozzarella cheese, whatever it is.
[138:55.55]Mozzarella.
[138:56.41]Yeah, I tried it with that.
[138:57.49]It worked.
[138:58.43]Like, it just works.
[139:00.82]Sounds good.
[139:03.72]That makes sense to me.
[139:05.74]Oh, man.
[139:08.58]It's just crazy.
[139:10.45]It changes the flavor completely.
[139:11.97]And I'm telling you, the world's going to find out about it.
[139:17.61]One day.
[139:18.07]Have you guys ever had tuna fish and pretzels?
[139:21.66]No, I haven't, no.
[139:22.91]no you're just naming two foods I am the enzymes the enzymes from the two something about the enzymes from the tuna fish that it mixed with the salt and the um kind of what's what's the coating on a pretzel oh what's it called it's a very specific coating that's on a pretzel malt yeah the malt from the pretzel and the enzymes from the tuna fish
[139:48.17]You will eat this.
[139:49.65]I've had people... I've mentioned this before, and people go, dude, you're sicko.
[139:53.92]You're gross.
[139:55.08]And then, like, three streams later, I'll get, like, an at.
[139:57.88]It's like, hey, man, like, I, dude, I was so wrong.
[140:00.56]I fucked up everything.
[140:01.51]My whole life turned around after I started eating that.
[140:04.03]It's good, and I got it wrong, and I'm sorry that I got it wrong.
[140:08.93]Can I do this with chicken salad, or does it have to be fish?
[140:11.25]It's gotta be tuna fish.
[140:13.12]Ah, damn.
[140:14.32]See, I got the same experience with popcorn with hot sauce.
[140:17.89]Dude, you put... Holly and I started doing that, dude.
[140:20.75]It's amazing.
[140:22.31]Really?
[140:22.57]It's good, right?
[140:23.10]It's good.
[140:23.64]Popcorn with hot sauce?
[140:25.60]It's good.
[140:26.12]Yeah.
[140:26.70]Some Tabasco.
[140:27.36]You make some fresh popcorn.
[140:29.76]Slap some Tabasco all over it and shake the popcorn.
[140:33.13]Man.
[140:33.85]It's great.
[140:34.51]It's amazing.
[140:35.09]Wow.
[140:37.50]Yeah, you got to shake it in the bag, though.
[140:38.98]So you go... And then just shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[140:41.82]You don't really want wet popcorn.
[140:43.26]Yeah.
[140:43.66]It happens to get... It messes up.
[140:45.82]Tabasco in a microwave popcorn is awesome.
[140:49.34]I did not know that until you told me.
[140:51.54]And it became... That's fire.
[140:53.06]That's like the way I eat popcorn now.
[140:55.85]You know what's really good with popcorn and on many other food products?
[141:00.31]The Vinesauce hot sauce.
[141:02.81]So delicious.
[141:04.80]Yeah.
[141:08.22]I put that on everything.
[141:09.92]Thanks, man.
[141:11.40]frosted flakes anything yeah dude put it on watermelon and feta I feel like I could make a great cereal I would love to make a cereal that was just I I know all the secrets I would make it so good that honestly you know what the thing is with like streamers the secrets the the streamer like merch thing is is getting like weirder than just shirts now and like Charlie has a soap
[141:37.25]Like, he literally sent me, like, a bunch of his soap, and it's good.
[141:40.96]I mean, I don't know if it's good or not, but it seems like it's good.
[141:43.18]Smells nice.
[141:46.09]So, yeah, dude, you should do cereal.
[141:47.67]Jerma cereal.
[141:48.91]And, like, you could do, like, comics and, like, give away, like, a toy.
[141:51.57]Dude, it would be a marshmallow-based cereal, but I would be respectful with the marshmallows, and I would do it correctly.
[142:01.74]What other kind of properties of the cereal?
[142:04.58]Like, would it be like a Lucky Charms situation or like a frosted plate?
[142:08.48]What kind of cereal would it be?
[142:10.24]Okay.
[142:10.39]What kind of cereal?
[142:12.35]I think the cereal would be... It would be a, you know, obviously it would be kind of like a whole grain based, you know, like a Lucky Charms scenario.
[142:20.89]But the problem with Lucky Charms is I don't really love the... I almost would want it to be like Pops with marshmallows.
[142:28.10]You guys ever heard of Pops?
[142:29.70]Yeah.
[142:30.43]Imagine if Pops was a little less sweet, but it had marshmallows.
[142:34.89]Puck, it's up to you.
[142:38.75]Alright.
[142:39.64]Wow.
[142:41.80]Everyone died!
[142:43.68]I screwed up!
[142:44.90]Damn.
[142:49.01]Wait, explain the cereal again.
[142:52.81]Pops?
[142:54.59]I cut the sugar down, right?
[142:55.77]Like, all these cereals, they taste so good.
[142:58.76]Corn Pops?
[142:59.40]Like Corn Pops, yes.
[143:00.48]Oh, okay.
[143:01.64]Take the sugar of corn pops, take the sweetness down, like, by half, and add cool marshmallows.
[143:08.79]The marshmallows with pops would go crazy.
[143:16.40]I think it'd be cool if you opened a box of pops and it was just one giant pop that was box-shaped.
[143:24.07]Do you think this is a cereal everyone would eat every day?
[143:26.98]Or just, like, one time and then...
[143:29.10]That's the thing, you make a meme cereal, people buy it and they go, oh, that was funny, but I would want it to actually be kind of good.
[143:35.83]Whole grains in there.
[143:36.53]What's on the box?
[143:37.35]Like, what's the mascot?
[143:38.53]If it's corn pops, it wouldn't be whole grain.
[143:42.50]Wait, who's picking the map?
[143:43.34]Me?
[143:45.49]Um, I guess I could.
[143:46.41]Are we doing it again?
[143:47.15]Or... I think we're failures.
[143:50.99]Can we just cheat and go next level?
[143:54.78]Oh, this is it then.
[143:56.99]Do you guys fuck with Dippin' Dots?
[144:01.03]Yeah.
[144:01.43]Yeah, when I see it.
[144:03.86]Do you think that is an S-tier dessert?
[144:06.80]Yes.
[144:09.87]Like the original brand or is it like the off-brand or just the concept?
[144:13.89]Just like the Dippin' Dots, like the original poke.
[144:16.30]I wish if there was a machine that could make Dippin' Dots in the house like the Ninja Swirly.
[144:23.23]I would own four of them.
[144:28.16]I think it's gonna happen.
[144:29.70]Ninja Dots.
[144:30.60]It's gonna come.
[144:31.59]Alright, Ninja, if you're listening right now... Get off Fortnite and make the dot thing.
[144:38.84]We need an attachment to the Ninja Creamy Swirly that does dip in dots.
[144:45.33]It's probably gonna be impossible, but you guys figure out everything, so you'll figure it out.
[144:51.92]Ninja Dots.
[144:54.47]I haven't had Dippin' Dots in a while, but they're good.
[145:02.94]I did have one kind of recently.
[145:06.32]I liked it.
[145:07.38]I had rolled ice cream.
[145:08.67]Have you ever heard of that?
[145:10.09]Really good.
[145:11.29]No.
[145:12.35]Where it's like they have like a cold slab.
[145:14.23]It's like cold stone, but then they kind of like mix ingredients into the ice cream and then roll it into like a tube.
[145:21.99]like a small tube or oreo rolled ice cream is dude that's what I had insane I had that exact one man it's just you I don't know about this yeah we're having a hard time here you got it on the count of three we all say our favorite dipping does flavor three two one go chocolate
[145:49.47]Cotton candy.
[145:50.99]That's a good pick.
[145:52.47]Cotton candy.
[145:55.15]Or bubble gum.
[145:56.32]Bubble gum.
[145:57.42]Dude, bubble gum ice cream or cotton candy.
[146:00.28]I think bubble gum is better.
[146:01.56]Honestly, doing like the wild man is fine too.
[146:04.09]Just to put it, but they do a ton of it.
[146:05.95]They just mix everything together.
[146:07.91]Oh yeah.
[146:08.29]No, we had, was it, it was yours called the wild man in Canada?
[146:11.34]It was called a Superman.
[146:15.34]I think it actually is.
[146:16.20]No, it is.
[146:16.79]It is Superman.
[146:17.31]You're right.
[146:17.65]I don't know why I just said wild man.
[146:20.33]It was like a... This ice cream store was called Laura Secord or something.
[146:25.38]Yeah, it's like chocolate, strawberry.
[146:27.32]It's kind of like Neapolitan, but not.
[146:34.77]Did you just get to level one?
[146:37.11]Why did you just get a notification for the first combo?
[146:41.86]Because I've just been spamming arrows.
[146:45.68]They're not that effective, I don't think, arrows.
[146:48.27]Nope.
[146:49.88]They are not.
[146:51.06]Also, you level up more based on hits, apparently.
[146:55.35]That's what I'm learning.
[146:56.27]If you hit enemy many times a lot, you get more experience than just killing them.
[147:01.50]That's why you're level 8.
[147:03.52]I think the saw is broken.
[147:05.34]I've been doing no damage.
[147:07.32]I've fallen behind.
[147:08.12]It's hard to catch up.
[147:12.95]You want to play Heroes of Hammerwatch?
[147:17.62]Yeah, but like Jerma doesn't.
[147:20.62]He's right, I don't.
[147:23.01]You actually don't.
[147:24.47]Do you see that game and say no?
[147:26.85]Um, no.
[147:28.47]I just know that that's one of those games that you need to play it a lot.
[147:33.70]It seems like an amazing game, but you gotta put time into it, don't you?
[147:39.53]Yeah.
[147:40.53]Kind of.
[147:41.61]Kind of like Abiotic Factor, which Ster completely blows you off on every fucking day.
[147:46.11]I'm still getting over it.
[147:50.78]Can you guys at least play to the part where my guy is in the game?
[147:54.96]So you can hear my voice lines.
[147:55.79]Also, of our four-person group, I was the last one to stop playing.
[147:58.71]I know, he was.
[147:59.93]Ster was the one who stuck through with me.
[148:05.07]I didn't play it once with you guys.
[148:07.26]He stayed up so late for me each night, too.
[148:11.46]Ster's the best.
[148:12.62]I haven't even been to your guys' lobby once.
[148:21.37]What does the stink do?
[148:24.20]I still don't even know.
[148:28.39]That's you doing magic.
[148:30.33]You have to hold right trigger to do magic.
[148:33.15]Hold right trigger and press a button.
[148:34.08]It's indicating that you're charging up.
[148:37.50]It's indicating that you... Ooh, that is cool.
[148:44.27]My magic does one.
[148:47.18]Ster's character is just like a child with a lollipop.
[148:55.79]Also, Abiotic is great.
[148:58.37]I love it, but they've made it easier to switch settings so that you don't get hungry as much.
[149:06.06]When we played it,
[149:07.92]It was just food survival for three hours and then exploring for like an hour.
[149:12.36]It's rough.
[149:13.00]It's really rough.
[149:14.30]We turned that down.
[149:16.01]We had it on low and we were still struggling.
[149:20.03]So we definitely found a way to make that work.
[149:23.20]And one of my mods, Mono, was doing farming and helping with the water and we were still dying because we were so hungry.
[149:35.14]If you get irradiated once and throw it all up and have to eat twice.
[149:40.26]I'm dead.
[149:41.08]It's tough.
[149:41.47]I mean, it's customizable.
[149:43.41]You can play however you want.
[149:45.15]I was calling it like scientist green hell in the start.
[149:48.30]What the fuck?
[149:50.32]We hit the difficulty wall.
[149:51.48]We need more defense.
[149:52.42]Maybe I shouldn't have put every single... I just saw for the first time your revive face.
[149:59.85]You have a different face for your revive?
[150:02.16]It's like leaning it.
[150:03.24]Is it the same face?
[150:04.62]I don't know I think it just tilted to the side break these people and there's food in here it's like destroying the Pompeii people I died again oh my god that guy hit killed me in one hit
[150:28.38]the best run you guys have had so far was when I was dead the whole level yeah what happened that's so weird and we were like leveled we had less levels we weren't even paying attention we were talking about nobody was even playing the game we were just walking around oh my god I can't I can't even get you guys huge huge
[150:57.37]huge I think I died instantly after you press the last button I have to I died oh my god wait if you come with me I have a sandwich that's gonna be difficult but I will try I'm done you got this poke I can't I can't hit I can't do anything there you go
[151:28.54]I do no damage in this form.
[151:30.12]I'm dead.
[151:31.16]Oh, you can die in this?
[151:33.80]Oh, my God.
[151:36.33]Oh, range really showing what it's worth right now.
[151:40.15]Ooh.
[151:51.47]I'm just dreaming.
[151:55.12]I like that you gave Miku the leak.
[151:58.52]I think that's what she started with oh oh that makes way more sense yeah wait no guys go right oh man yeah we'll just keep going right alright make sure you get crunchies
[152:28.42]That's what Colossus does in the X-Men game.
[152:31.91]I think that's where they are parodying.
[152:34.75]I think I was in the air the entire time.
[153:04.93]Alright, we got this.
[153:06.53]Yeah.
[153:07.87]You do some good juggling.
[153:11.89]Make sure you all get a sandwich, because then we can all just destroy the volcano.
[153:18.94]Wait, do you need a sandwich to kill it?
[153:20.54]I think you do.
[153:21.84]Did you ever see Joe vs. the Volcano?
[153:25.16]No.
[153:26.11]What is it?
[153:27.51]Joe Biden?
[153:28.57]Weirdo.
[153:29.41]No.
[153:30.29]It's like a weirdo Tom Hanks movie directed by, I believe...
[153:34.44]Was it Joe Dante?
[153:35.48]It's just a good movie.
[153:36.24]It's just a weird, good movie.
[153:38.32]I don't even know how to explain it.
[153:40.23]It's kind of surreal.
[153:45.97]It's not really selling it.
[153:50.02]But yeah, it's literally Tom Hanks versus a volcano.
[153:54.82]Who wins?
[153:57.41]You have to find it for yourself when you watch it.
[153:59.65]Do you remember when he got big?
[154:01.71]That kind of thing.
[154:04.54]It's like the third time I stole the food.
[154:06.41]Like, yeah, that's a movie too.
[154:08.23]Oh, it's one of those of like a film.
[154:11.45]Like a film.
[154:13.87]That's cool.
[154:18.36]You ever see a racer head?
[154:19.66]Well, it's somewhere between that and Toy Story.
[154:27.75]Is my res face?
[154:28.81]My res face.
[154:29.45]Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
[154:31.07]Let's go.
[154:31.49]Let's go.
[154:33.74]Yeah, the res phase is different.
[154:36.64]Yeah, you have this really intense phase.
[154:39.32]I thought it was like my dead phase.
[154:47.89]Oh, I didn't move.
[154:51.47]Wait, we did it.
[154:51.87]Wow, we just fucking easily handled that level.
[154:53.66]Yeah, we just had to go crazy on it.
[155:00.28]Oops.
[155:01.16]Sorry, picked up two of them.
[155:02.22]You got all the sandwiches.

[156:18.51]Such is life.
[156:21.69]Oh, we all lived.
[156:25.02]That was intense.
[156:28.62]Uh, Vinny.
[156:30.08]How did you get that much XP?
[156:31.03]Yeah, I have no idea.
[156:34.47]I just hit things a ton, I guess.

[161:58.62]He had to take care of Otto.
[162:02.30]There's a movie called Repo Man and the main character is Otto.
[162:06.46]and I thought his name was Auto, A-U-T-O.
[162:09.64]I forgot that Auto was a real name, like O-T-T-O.
[162:15.39]It's a movie about cars.
[162:16.51]I figured maybe he's named after like automobiles.
[162:18.91]I don't know.
[162:21.14]Wait, O-T-T-O or A-T-T-O?
[162:23.88]O-T-T-O is the real name, but yeah.
[162:29.68]I forgot that that was a real name, so I thought it was like named after automobiles.
[162:34.59]That's unfortunate for you.
[162:41.86]Watto?
[162:48.37]I like how Poke called us the funniest comedians in the world.
[162:52.56]Like, what?
[162:53.30]The highest level.
[162:55.10]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[162:59.65]No, that's pretty far.
[163:01.17]That's pretty far off.
[163:04.06]Look, it says MG.
[163:05.14]The hair in the ear.
[163:07.84]It's Matt Groening's initials.
[163:12.81]Is that the movie about repossessing organs?
[163:15.72]No.
[163:17.06]That's Repo Genetic Opera.
[163:23.33]Do we rez him or nah?
[163:25.23]Nah.
[163:28.94]Ow.
[163:29.26]You rez me just in time to get punched.
[163:34.17]Now we're dead together, look.
[163:36.91]I want to show you why my level is higher than everyone else's.
[163:39.31]It's this.
[163:39.91]Dude, your combos are insane.
[163:41.60]It's just air combos.
[163:43.40]That was the trick.
[163:45.74]You get them into a corner and you just air combo them.
[163:47.68]You get a point every time you hit.
[163:53.83]Hold on, I'm back.
[163:55.77]I might be back for just a minute.
[163:58.08]I might need something else.
[163:59.32]Rock!
[163:59.92]Rock!
[164:00.60]But, we'll see.
[164:02.32]Oh, shit.
[164:03.92]How you guys doing?
[164:04.84]You guys have been cheating.
[164:05.55]You've been using potions.
[164:09.85]We're doing something.
[164:11.55]We're still here.
[164:12.41]What's this character?
[164:15.28]I don't know.
[164:16.06]I saw him on the workshop and I just looked so goofy and dumb that I wanted to include him.
[164:27.13]You got a bird?
[164:30.95]Oh my God.
[164:31.65]It's an angry bird.
[164:34.82]I'm a looter.
[164:38.74]Alright, get it.
[164:42.03]What do we do?
[164:43.99]We definitely don't touch the fire.
[164:45.79]I say walking into the fire.
[164:47.67]You gotta hit that paint can on the right.
[164:51.30]Oak is doing it.
[164:59.35]Ah!
[165:02.93]Dude!
[165:04.98]Did we hit the hand?
[165:07.54]I think you can hit both.
[165:10.50]Oh, I love numbers like that.
[165:12.46]Oh, yeah.
[165:13.68]It's Ragnarok Online.
[165:15.99]Oh, you're playing Ragnarok 3?
[165:18.21]Oh, hell yeah.
[165:18.73]You saw that?
[165:19.91]Yeah.
[165:20.91]Looked really good.
[165:22.74]Oh, no.
[165:26.72]I tried.
[165:28.59]Trust me, I tried.
[165:30.37]Uh-oh.
[165:35.90]Sir, I've never seen you bad at a game.
[165:38.16]I'm just gonna say it right now.
[165:40.48]First time ever.
[165:41.79]I'm good at the ones that I like.
[165:42.69]What's happening?
[165:47.25]Oh.
[165:49.52]Okay, that was my fault.
[165:51.18]I was scratching my leg.
[165:55.21]You guys got it.
[166:02.30]Crazy numbers.
[166:03.46]Holy fuck.
[166:05.19]I can't even count that high.
[166:09.42]Buzzsaw is so broken.
[166:10.76]Buzzsaw is... You just did like 600 damage or something.
[166:14.88]More than that!
[166:15.48]That's... Oh my god!
[166:16.91]How much damage are you doing?
[166:22.83]You'll be fine.
[166:25.82]No!
[166:26.82]Let's trade characters, Poke.
[166:28.78]Alright.
[166:29.68]I'll give you my files.
[166:38.11]What am I aiming at?
[166:42.00]I'm going to be so underleveled now because I missed a whole level.
[166:47.84]Yeah, same.
[166:56.79]I have one more food question and then I'm done with food questions.
[166:59.52]I just want to know.

[167:04.06]What is a fairground food?
[167:05.50]Corn dog.

[167:39.90]Brajol is fucking awesome.
[167:40.74]Wait, hold on a second.
[167:41.34]Ster, you have more XP than me.
[167:43.05]What the hell did I do wrong?
[167:44.29]I'm doing... Nah, they nerfed me.
[167:47.19]I'm built different.
[167:50.54]Ster, this build is... Oof.
[167:55.10]It just takes a little longer to come online.
[168:02.33]I didn't level?
[168:03.42]Alright, whatever.
[168:05.24]But once I can buy Heartseeker...
[168:11.79]But you can go to the end game.
[168:21.96]Vinny, buy the melee weapon from the fire store.
[168:25.20]Oh, yeah, that one, right?
[168:27.22]We probably shouldn't eat these.
[168:28.50]That's our healing for the whole run.
[168:31.37]Oh, whoa, oops.
[168:37.89]Let's just recharge the whole save.
[168:42.84]Wait, so you downloaded these?
[168:44.52]The cats?
[168:45.98]Yeah.
[168:49.07]No, I mean, no.
[168:49.79]No, I think these are... What are these?
[168:54.72]Poke, do you ever play Ragnarok Battle offline?
[168:57.82]No.
[168:59.78]It's like a side scroll beat-em-up like this.
[169:01.63]It's really good.
[169:03.15]Wait, actually?
[169:04.23]Yeah.
[169:05.03]Be like numbers.
[169:08.10]Oh, the food despawns.
[169:27.93]I think you would actually want to play that.
[169:29.13]Are these axes not being annoying to you guys?
[169:30.41]Like, I swear I'm annoying myself with the noise.
[169:32.61]No, please do.
[169:33.13]Just do it.
[169:33.41]You're killing everything, so we're happy.
[169:36.10]Everything is dying.
[169:37.82]I mean, the whole game right now is kind of just like... Yeah.
[169:49.65]Pencil cheese.
[169:51.13]The curse of poor player co-op games.
[169:54.93]Oh, sorry.
[169:55.85]You talk.
[169:56.20]You talk.
[169:56.87]No, go ahead, guys.
[169:57.87]I just said it's a four-player co-op game.
[169:59.61]Curse.
[170:01.98]Somebody in your chat said, is Poke's weapon a dildo?
[170:04.60]No, it's a bong.
[170:05.50]I'm so sorry, everybody.
[170:07.02]No, I wouldn't do shit like that.
[170:10.37]Okay.
[170:11.11]I'm not that kind of person.
[170:18.40]No, I don't want that.
[170:22.33]Actually, that's not bad defense.
[170:25.88]Yeah.
[170:26.28]It's okay.
[170:27.32]I'll use it at level 10.
[170:32.21]Wait, do we all have to get it to unlock it?
[170:33.81]I forgot.
[170:34.71]I think as long as you touch it.
[170:36.94]I think you have to actually touch it.
[170:43.41]Where has it gone?
[170:45.20]I think somebody has it.
[170:46.98]Or maybe not.
[170:48.22]I think it despawns after a little while.
[170:51.24]What you can do is you can go to the blacksmith and I think somebody can pick it up and then just grab something else and you can kind of trade it that way.
[171:09.20]Meh.
[171:12.97]Meh.
[171:19.61]Jesus.
[171:22.09]Yeah, if they don't move, they just die.
[171:24.77]Yeah, you chew things up with it.
[171:27.76]It's crazy.
[171:28.24]Delete them.
[171:33.20]Meanwhile, my guy's shooting acorns.
[171:38.87]How come the volcano level was so hard and these scorpions die in one hit?
[171:43.37]That was the DPS wall.
[172:03.04]Dude, am I crazy?
[172:03.76]Where's the corn guy?
[172:04.72]I think that's a little later still.
[172:07.77]I thought it was at the very beginning of the game.
[172:11.71]I got stunlock comboed.
[172:14.68]Yeah, I can't really go anywhere.
[172:28.11]Food.
[172:29.05]No, I don't want money.
[172:29.69]I want food.
[172:36.19]How did I miss that?
[172:44.94]I don't know.
[172:46.18]You're like right there.
[172:51.51]I hate that noise.
[172:54.33]I don't like that noise.
[172:57.22]Who are these things?
[172:58.54]My door makes that noise every time I open it.
[173:02.22]Oh, you don't yell at the door, but you yell at me when I move my chair.
[173:04.51]Okay.
[173:06.91]Who's the artist that made your character?
[173:09.10]Chat member by the name of Cammy.
[173:12.00]I don't know what you're talking about, Poke.
[173:13.31]I don't remember that.
[173:15.85]I died.
[173:16.39]Oh, no.
[173:22.97]Yeah, nope.
[173:23.47]I don't remember.
[173:28.08]You used to give me microaggression when I used to adjust my chair.
[173:33.79]Huh?
[173:35.45]You're like, did you just move?
[173:39.09]What?
[173:40.76]I'm just making a joke.
[173:43.88]You're too literal.
[173:45.55]I'm also making a joke.
[173:47.97]You just don't know.
[173:48.65]Leave me on the ground for a minute.
[173:52.54]No, get him up.
[173:57.34]Get him up.
[173:57.84]Get him up.
[173:58.18]Let him die again.
[173:58.80]I hear, like, faint Jerma.
[174:07.26]I'm coming.
[174:11.21]Okay.
[174:11.33]He's good.
[174:11.77]There you go.
[174:24.35]Thanks, Lickster, for ruining our game.
[174:26.74]I wish I could have had some nostalgia to know what these enemies were.
[174:29.20]Right?
[174:36.50]I'm sorry.
[174:37.06]It's all about the content.
[174:43.57]You can host and we can start over.
[174:57.51]Hexen Remastered has a co-op mode?
[175:02.90]Oh.
[175:02.98]Oh, Benny, I saw you playing System Shock 2.
[175:06.24]Yeah.
[175:07.75]The remaster or remake, whatever, has co-op, doesn't it?
[175:12.31]It does, yeah.
[175:14.73]Would it be fun in co-op?
[175:16.00]I feel like, I don't know.
[175:18.24]I feel like that's interesting.
[175:19.46]Have you ever played the original?
[175:21.02]I have not.
[175:21.50]No, never.
[175:23.72]So, this is my first time.
[175:24.97]I love it.
[175:27.01]really good and it's hard but the gameplay I could see it I could see it working really great for co-op I played the OG back in the day co-op online hamachi
[175:46.69]Yeah, I wish I could.
[175:47.87]I haven't heard in a while.
[175:49.01]If somebody was playing it right now, I'd be like fun to play with somebody like that knew what they were doing.
[175:53.30]You know the game spy symbol the other day for the first time in like 20 years and had like the biggest flashbacks.
[176:02.00]And then your knees crumble to dust.
[176:06.38]I've never played it.
[176:07.46]I've heard it was fun, especially with somebody else that could help you and stuff.
[176:11.39]I've heard it's fun that way, but I've just never played it.
[176:14.33]It seems like it would be cool because I'm going like... Oh my god, I'm getting my ass handed to me.
[176:20.26]I'm trying, guys.
[176:24.42]I'm trying.
[176:25.48]Oh my god.
[176:31.89]You're up.
[176:32.97]Yeah!
[176:42.17]No!
[176:47.18]Yo.
[176:48.25]Yeah, Vinny, do you like, I don't know, do you know anybody that would play with me?
[176:51.43]Like, somebody that doesn't know how to play, but would you know anybody that would want to play?
[176:55.62]Like, System Shock 2 co-op?
[176:58.39]Somebody that's like... Are you willing?
[177:00.55]Yeah.
[177:00.67]Yeah.
[177:02.27]To someone that's what?
[177:04.35]Pathetic?
[177:08.26]When I first asked you that question, somebody in my chat said he's so badly baiting for an invite, and then I just started baiting for an invite for the next five minutes.
[177:16.57]I started getting that, yeah.
[177:18.51]Even my chat was like, Vinny didn't get the hint.
[177:20.92]It's like, no, I got it.
[177:21.84]I'm just halfway through the game.
[177:23.04]I don't know if you want to join in halfway through.
[177:26.18]nah I'm just kidding you can't it's fun wait can you chat can you can he join in halfway through if he wanted to like just like jump in for a minute oh
[177:45.62]Okay, so Jerma, I will propose this now, right?
[177:50.71]You don't have to give me an answer, but I want you to think about it.
[177:52.72]Toss it around the old brain stem, alright?
[177:55.18]Get this through your squirt pipe and let me know what you think.
[177:58.29]Alright.
[177:59.45]System Shock 2, I can get you a key from Night Dive.
[178:03.13]Okay.
[178:03.57]I play.
[178:04.72]I resume my game.
[178:05.96]You jump in and you just do dumb shit.
[178:08.46]How's that sound?
[178:11.51]is this kind of like a like a like you have a spell where you're gonna cast summon me to like just go blow up into like a vent somewhere and then I leave yeah like one life you summoned me for one life the mysterious stranger in fallout I would say this if you're a fan I mean I know some of the games that you like growing up but like genuinely I am angry I didn't play this game growing up it's that good
[178:41.17]It's tough, like, to adjust to it.
[178:43.48]Like, I was playing it like Half-Life and dying.
[178:46.32]But it's really good.
[178:47.64]So I would just recommend it like you play it.
[178:49.72]I would just say play it.
[178:51.23]What happened?
[178:52.79]Dude, it's... Oh, no.
[178:54.59]Sterk, don't let it get you.
[178:56.31]Sterk, don't let it... No, don't.
[178:57.83]You have to go tell the story that you saw this and tell our story.
[179:01.68]Oh, no.
[179:06.34]Dude, why don't we do, like, a one-life challenge for certain games?
[179:11.55]You know what I mean?
[179:12.47]Like, imagine, like, Project Zomboid, and if we die, you just have to leave.
[179:17.36]I'd be down for that.
[179:21.07]Yeah, and, like, Tarkov?
[179:23.99]Yeah.
[179:25.63]Be too easy for me.
[179:31.24]Someone else proposed in chat that if you caught up to me, Jerma, to my progress, then we could just finish the rest of the game co-op.
[179:43.55]So there's options here if you want to actually do that.
[179:46.04]We'll talk.
[179:46.46]We'll talk behind the scenes.
[179:48.40]We'll talk behind the scenes.
[179:50.18]Yeah, but I'll get you code.
[179:51.80]I think Nightdive would be very happy about that.
[179:55.05]Yeah, I'd play.
[179:57.11]What's that, Ster?
[179:58.49]Nothing.
[179:59.81]Do you want a code from Nightdive?
[180:02.50]No, I'm good.
[180:03.44]You can't be saying that.
[180:06.36]Like it could be from somebody else, but no, it's not.
[180:09.18]Sir, if you're not invited, don't ask to go.
[180:12.58]You ever hear of that?
[180:15.81]It's the new meme for the kids this generation.
[180:17.97]I like to flex the connections a little bit.
[180:19.55]I like to say, you know, from Night Dive Studios, those who have remastered the Turok series, I can get you a code.
[180:25.45]Okay, what if they heard that you were getting me a code and they were like, dude, we don't fucking want him to do that.
[180:31.32]Anybody but him.
[180:32.95]yeah would you still want to know how that feels I actually know how that feels um is that like when hollister told people they weren't they didn't want them in their store that happened what do you mean I swear or was a different place I'm saying I'm seeing a lot of question marks there was there was some quote from the CEO I thought it was hollister of being like yeah we don't want ugly people in here
[181:04.83]I think it was Abercrombie.
[181:07.13]We don't want ugly people in here.
[181:12.42]Goddamn.
[181:12.82]That's like a Larry David skit.
[181:14.70]Are you sure it wasn't an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm?
[181:20.77]No.
[181:20.85]Abercrombie?
[181:22.73]I think it was Abercrombie.
[181:23.59]Abercrombie and Fitch.
[181:29.00]I thought it was Abercrombie and Finch for many years.
[181:34.57]10 seconds.
[181:36.35]I'm dead.
[181:41.16]We got to get over there.
[181:42.36]It's over.
[181:42.90]You can't waste time juggling in here, I've been told.
[181:51.83]Now you tell me.
[181:57.41]here I'm gonna look this up maxed I'm gonna type in Google let me try some gork abercrombie and fitch ugly people no abercrombie and fitch ugly people yeah it came up I found it read it to him let him know 12 years ago the CEO of abercrombie and fitch went on record as saying he doesn't want fat or unattractive people wearing his clothes or employed at his company yo what a motherfucker
[182:22.46]Damn.
[182:22.80]Yeah, me with the question marks.
[182:24.68]Dude, this was a Larry David sketch, too, when they had the ugly section of the restaurant.
[182:29.66]I mean, as someone... I wouldn't mind.
[182:31.51]I don't mind he said that.
[182:32.63]As someone he's targeting, I don't mind.
[182:34.37]I'm just gonna say it.
[182:38.73]Yeah, no, fuck that guy.
[182:44.44]Oh, we don't... There's nothing that way.
[182:52.61]Good poke.

[182:57.94]With some vegetable juice?

[184:23.38]Okay, we gotta hurry.
[184:24.10]Focus up.
[184:24.86]I'm here.
[184:25.16]I'm here.
[184:25.56]I'm locked in right now.
[184:26.36]No juggling.
[184:26.92]I was juggling before.
[184:28.27]Yeah.
[184:28.85]I'm locked in.
[184:29.25]Oh, God.
[184:29.81]This is an awful segment.
[184:31.13]Oh, man.
[184:31.59]Alright.
[184:32.77]You just saved me from saying some stupid shit.
[184:36.07]Nice.
[184:36.57]I'm trapped.
[184:43.50]Oh, God.
[184:43.70]Oh, my goodness.
[184:47.66]Oh, look who put all the points in agility.
[184:50.60]Oh no, Pogue!
[184:52.38]Um... Guys?
[185:01.65]What is this?
[185:03.89]What is this?
[185:05.48]Whose face is this, dude?
[185:07.06]Whose face is this?
[185:10.22]I have no idea, I just saw it and I was like, I don't know, I'll take that one.
[185:16.11]What the fuck?
[185:34.48]Sorry.
[185:36.88]So it just said, not an Abercrombie shopper.
[185:44.57]Oh my god, you got me ugly laughing.
[185:47.92]Fucking hell.
[185:50.86]This is so... crazy.
[185:53.18]Oh, what the fuck.
[185:55.49]No, you're still cute.
[185:57.21]I'm gonna die again.
[186:01.21]What was that?
[186:02.01]What was that noise?
[186:04.72]There's a clip, Jerma, there is a clip of you hearing me doing meat noises.
[186:09.51]It's like me, you, Criken, and I'm doing, and I'm just like doing that in the background while we're playing Worms like seven years ago.
[186:18.98]Oh my God, that's ancient.
[186:21.27]And you just go, you go, you go, what was that noise?
[186:27.80]And I think about that a lot, weirdly.
[186:30.87]Just the way you were so confused about the noise I made.
[186:34.11]I don't know, man.
[186:36.64]Just things stick in your head for some reason.
[186:38.60]I don't know.
[186:41.22]We kind of are a noise crew, aren't we?
[186:45.67]I feel like we're very much making noises.
[186:48.57]Love a good noise.
[186:49.18]It's kind of half of my career.
[186:51.18]Yeah.
[186:57.74]I like the noise these things are making.
[187:01.34]That's coming out of that face, yeah.
[187:05.79]No, that's a scorpion noise.
[187:06.89]I know that sound.
[187:09.65]Oh.
[187:17.80]We lost our llamas, yeah.
[187:21.13]We're good.
[187:29.77]Ask Jerma about the Dreamcast chat message he thinks about sometimes.
[187:35.28]Is that a stream-appropriate topic, chat member?
[187:39.35]I mean, somebody in chat said it.
[187:44.04]And you already read it.
[187:46.02]I played, this is like four or five years ago now, I did a Dreamcast week where I just, I got a Dreamcast, I played almost the whole half of the catalog or whatever it is.
[187:56.81]I played like 30, 40, 50 games over the course of like a week or two.
[188:01.96]And... Just to check them out or did you finish them?
[188:06.27]Just a bit, just like kind of a smorgasbord, just kind of pulling out random stuff.
[188:10.05]And...
[188:11.23]Somebody joined the chat and I was in the middle of playing, I think it was a game called Blue Stinger, I think is what the name of the game was called.
[188:20.11]The game was awful, by the way.
[188:22.77]And this person in all lowercase, no badges, no sub, like it was just all lowercase, new, probably like somebody that had came to the, new viewer, right?
[188:35.45]Just wrote, the Dreamcast fucking sucks.
[188:39.23]LMAO.
[188:40.05]And that's all they said.
[188:41.88]And it like ruined the rest of the stream.
[188:43.70]Like it fucked up the whole rest of the stream.
[188:45.76]That's all it takes?
[188:47.18]That's all it took.
[188:50.97]It's just the fact that it was just, like, all lowercase.
[188:53.39]I think it was, like, a gray name.
[188:55.11]Grab the sausage, everybody.
[188:58.76]Just unlock it.
[189:00.76]And then that dude went on to be, like, a pinnacle of the community.
[189:04.19]Never mind.
[189:06.61]I think he's still here to this day.
[189:07.73]He's here to this day, I think.
[189:09.61]I hope.
[189:10.25]I don't think so.
[189:13.84]Yeah, I think I saw him earlier, and he said something about Castle Crashers.
[189:18.46]I think that's what they're referring to.
[189:19.80]I don't know.
[189:20.16]I mean, that's... That's probably it.
[189:22.67]Yeah.
[189:22.95]It seems like my chat is very... We have a weird overlap.
[189:26.47]People really know your stuff.
[189:29.08]Vinny, when you look at your Twitch discovery tab, do you also see my avatar up there with like 40% of our audience is shared between us?
[189:42.06]Yeah.
[189:42.26]Yeah.
[189:42.98]That's crazy.
[189:43.92]Yeah, it's a huge percentage.
[189:45.46]It's like it's insane.
[189:46.48]What is that?
[189:47.25]Oh my god?
[189:48.61]What did you get man?
[189:51.53]What the hell is this?
[189:55.86]I'll cover it man.
[189:56.74]What the fuck is that?
[189:58.02]I think it's a man boob.
[189:59.50]It's alright.
[190:00.33]It was belly and okay.
[190:05.09]I don't know.
[190:06.44]I don't know.
[190:06.78]It's good.
[190:07.16]We're good.
[190:07.58]We're good.
[190:07.90]We're good.
[190:08.42]It's not it's not bad.
[190:09.96]I'm curious about you guys, too.
[190:12.08]What do you guys have for... Because I think you two, Poke and Anster, you guys are both up on that list, too, at like 18%, 20% for both of you.
[190:21.32]Let me check who's mine.
[190:23.86]Yeah, Vinny.
[190:24.60]Mine says 94% Jerma.
[190:25.94]I'll check.
[190:26.36]I'll check.
[190:26.74]I know it's probably Northernlion in there somewhere, too.
[190:30.27]Ooh.
[190:31.15]Did you say 94%?
[190:34.73]Yeah, no, it's not that.
[190:36.44]I was going to say, holy shit.
[190:38.52]I think it's in the overview and then discovery.
[190:46.95]Yeah, Jerma985.
[190:50.24]You're tied with Summit at 13%, Jerma.
[190:53.44]Oh, wow.
[190:54.24]Yeah, let me see.
[190:59.21]So, okay, Jerma985 is number one with 15%.
[191:05.90]So it's only 15, but then Joel is 9%.
[191:08.75]Criken's five.
[191:10.19]Squeaks is five.
[191:11.73]Jabroni Mike, four.
[191:13.87]Lime's three.
[191:15.50]Ster, you're at 2%.
[191:16.14]Oh, go to engagement.
[191:18.20]Engagement, engagement, not discovery.
[191:19.92]That's like the last week.
[191:21.75]Yeah, go to engagement.
[191:23.13]Engagement, and it's the list over here on the right, an engagement.
[191:26.47]28, Jerma, 18, Vinny, 15, Poke.
[191:34.10]Wait, for 30 days?
[191:35.34]10% from VargSkelter.
[191:39.01]That's Joel, yeah.
[191:40.17]Wait, you mean channels you share viewers with?
[191:42.47]Yeah, channels you share viewers with.
[191:45.40]Joel, that's 47% with Joel.
[191:49.22]Wow.
[191:49.46]36% with you, Jerm.
[191:51.89]32% with Mike.
[191:54.15]20% with Kryken.
[191:55.33]18% with Limes.
[191:57.26]Wow.
[191:58.60]Yeah.
[191:58.94]Alright, so, Polk, what about you?
[192:02.25]60% Swallow Cop.
[192:06.77]36% GG.
[192:09.74]It's my other channel.
[192:11.52]Cool.
[192:13.67]And then second is GG 36%.
[192:15.67]Dizzy at 35%.
[192:17.51]And then Jerma at 24%.
[192:19.07]Cool.
[192:22.52]What about you, sir?
[192:24.20]I said all mine.
[192:24.88]No one was listening.
[192:25.85]Were you on the engagement tab or were you on the discovery tab?
[192:28.17]Yeah, I was on engagement.
[192:30.35]Oh, okay.
[192:31.59]I went through all of mine.
[192:32.85]What do you mean?
[192:33.39]I thought you were doing discovery.
[192:35.59]Oh, no, you said 99% Jerma.
[192:37.34]No, a second ago, I went through every single one of them, and Vinny said, oh, that's Joel, and then he went into his.
[192:46.06]You did do yours.
[192:48.88]And I absorbed all of it, by the way.
[192:50.79]That's interesting.
[192:52.71]You guys have some negative one memories.
[192:55.35]We do.
[192:55.99]My highest viewed tag?
[192:58.14]like you know how you can tag your channel, is Lenoverse.
[193:04.73]Yeah, Vinny, I got you at 36% at the top, Ster at 28%, Oak at 24%, and then it goes Squeaks at 21%, and then Criken at 21%.
[193:15.53]Northernlion was up here at like 20%.
[193:17.21]I think Northernlion just recently got bumped out.
[193:21.10]Yeah, I'm wondering if I had him in there somewhere at some point.
[193:25.59]I think Squeaks replaced Northernlion on my engagement list over the last month or two.
[193:32.34]Uh-oh, you're going to have to do a co-op with Northernlion to get him back in.
[193:38.53]Yeah, but we're doing 30 days, right?
[193:44.14]Just the last 30 days, yeah.
[193:45.42]I don't think you can even get it for longer.
[193:52.63]The NL overlap is insane considering you've never done anything together.
[193:56.14]Oh, me, yeah.
[193:57.33]We did something.
[193:59.74]House Flipper 1, I think.
[194:01.34]Yeah, we did House Flipper.
[194:03.02]Yeah, I got a chance to talk to him a little bit, but one day I'd love to do something with him.
[194:08.23]He's great.
[194:08.79]I don't know what.
[194:09.41]He's great.
[194:09.87]He's fun.
[194:10.23]Yeah, he's a really good dude.
[194:12.05]He called us one time, Vinny, because somebody was like, hey, did you see what Vinny said?
[194:16.10]Did you see what Jerma said about this?
[194:18.02]And he's like, sorry, dude, I don't keep up with the fucking Jerma, Vinny, Northernlion triumvirate all day.
[194:24.36]Yeah.
[194:25.08]It was funny.
[194:26.49]And now people actually come into my chat.
[194:28.91]They're like the triumvirate.
[194:33.72]He's funny.
[194:35.08]He's great.
[194:36.70]Yep.
[194:37.26]Yep.
[194:38.54]Yep.
[194:39.58]Alright.
[194:39.96]I think I'm going to play some Hexen.
[194:41.45]I don't know.
[194:43.05]Might bounce.
[194:43.93]You guys down for bouncing?
[194:45.59]Yeah.
[194:45.91]Might be out.
[194:47.51]I could finish my Ninja Turtles game.
[194:49.82]Look at the journalist chat for a second.
[194:51.04]Someone's like, play the damn game.
[194:53.86]Yeah.
[194:54.94]I checked out.
[194:57.61]Focus.
[194:57.83]Play the game.
[194:58.49]Focus.
[194:59.51]I think I've had enough.
[195:00.19]I killed Vinny.
[195:01.90]It's funny because I feel like, okay, before you go, Vinny, can we talk about this?
[195:05.62]Yeah.
[195:06.40]I was watching Ster Play Demon's Souls and I want just another account on Twitch just to be a fucking weirdo.
[195:14.63]It's so fun.
[195:15.37]I get it now.
[195:16.89]Just writing whatever comes into your mind and who cares?
[195:19.46]Just write it.
[195:20.14]Are you going to get banned?
[195:20.86]Fucking who cares?
[195:23.06]I have a question for you.
[195:25.18]If you were to be a hypothetical shit poster, what color would be your name?
[195:33.42]Oh, red.
[195:33.94]It would be a red name, 100%.
[195:35.22]Yes!
[195:35.94]Yes, it is the red names.
[195:37.19]Yeah.
[195:38.39]Yes.
[195:41.03]What are your colors right now?
[195:42.07]I'm that, like, teal, kind of light green.
[195:44.38]What are your colors?
[195:46.16]Green or something.
[195:47.28]Yeah.
[195:48.82]Some sort of green.
[195:49.78]Green.
[195:50.30]Oh, yeah.
[195:50.92]Pretty green.
[195:51.52]Are we all green?
[195:52.53]We all must be green boys, huh?
[195:54.65]Ster, are you green?
[195:55.13]Wait, are you green?
[195:56.55]My name?
[195:58.57]I think mine's black.
[196:00.68]No, in Twitch chat.
[196:01.98]What is it?
[196:05.05]yeah I sent it to black when they allowed you to have that a long time ago and with like a premium thing what wait start typing my chat hold on you're like a you're like a purple it might have changed since then you're like blue dude you're like a light blue oh yeah because I think it changes with your like your like Twitch background color that you choose so I think yeah I'm a little blue
[196:33.29]There definitely is a... You are blue.
[196:36.66]There definitely is a type... I feel like so many of the names... It matters.
[196:45.33]Hmm.
[196:45.43]I feel like yellow names are a sign of intelligence.
[196:47.45]It's like the INT.
[196:49.87]Wait, can't we go to the arena and just fight each other?
[196:51.38]I think so, yeah.
[196:54.02]They're definitely different stats.
[196:55.02]Like, red is just strength and, like, endurance or just rage.
[197:00.25]Um...
[197:04.61]Someone said they picked orange because of Garfield.
[197:07.92]So.
[197:09.26]Orange is hard to place.
[197:10.42]It's hard to place.
[197:12.08]Orange is also like, you know, orange cats are like kind of dumb.
[197:15.19]That's the joke.
[197:15.97]That's the meme.
[197:16.61]You ever heard about that?
[197:17.89]Like tabbies?
[197:19.11]Whatever.
[197:20.82]Orange cats are dumb.
[197:23.46]No, I mean, I don't.
[197:24.28]Hang on a minute.

[198:36.17]Eventually there will be more games, but I get you.
[198:38.60]Yeah, we probably, I don't know, is cross-play available for Mario Party Jamboree?
[198:44.78]I don't know.
[198:45.22]I'm sure it is.
[198:46.21]Isn't it, the whole point is the Switch 1 is still going to be, like, supported?
[198:51.85]Um... Going from, you mean, like, from Jamboree to Super Jamboree?
[198:56.80]Yeah, like, if he's on Switch 1 and we're on Switch 2, I wonder if that'll work.
