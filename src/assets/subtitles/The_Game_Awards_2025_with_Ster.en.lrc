[00:29.63]Hey, what's up?
[00:32.78]How are you?
[00:36.65]We are five minutes away.
[00:40.08]from the 2025 The Game Awards.
[00:46.94]Did I did I do this last year?
[00:50.34]Where's Ster?
[00:50.84]Ster ready?
[00:51.74]Ster wanted to do this.
[00:54.21]I asked Ster and then he said, yeah.
[00:55.94]So that means, you know what I mean?
[00:57.02]That means he wants to do it.
[01:03.41]I'm shocked you made it on time.
[01:07.84]This whole time, I've had my pinky finger...
[01:13.42]and my index finger up in the air, and I've been just going with my head.
[01:23.78]Hold on, somebody's calling me.
[01:30.14]Hello?
[01:30.85]Oh, gosh.
[01:32.17]I'm so sorry.
[01:33.34]I'm running late.
[01:34.48]You're running late?
[01:35.23]I was knocking.
[01:36.83]You white knuckling?
[01:37.58]I was looking off.
[01:40.56]It's four minutes until the Game Awards.
[01:44.52]What?
[01:45.12]It's four minutes till the game awards.
[01:46.71]Wait, what are you trying to say?
[01:49.24]It's four minutes until the game awards.
[01:53.06]I'm getting it open.
[01:55.10]Firefox is installing an update.
[01:58.54]I don't know if the volume's down, but I'm going to put it at max volume.
[02:02.49]Guys, this is maximum volume.
[02:05.50]Is this like low?
[02:06.74]Is the stream low?
[02:08.03]The game awards.
[02:10.24]Do you think they're going to give any this year?
[02:15.28]I think they're gonna give some awards.
[02:21.49]Can you say A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
[02:23.89]ABCDEFG, you were really quiet on the mic to me too.
[02:29.46]Alright.
[02:31.07]You should be good now.
[02:32.71]You're... You're... You're...
[02:35.79]Am I quiet to you?
[02:36.79]That would be strange because I haven't changed anything.
[02:38.48]You were quiet to me, but I had to increase you.
[02:41.76]Every time we ever get in a call, doesn't matter what, somebody has to have their slider adjusted.
[02:51.60]You're going to, hey, big man, you're going to come all the way over here and adjust my slider?
[02:57.14]We're three minutes away.
[02:59.24]We're three minutes away from the game awards.
[03:02.06]Oh, I was I. I'm using a different browser, so I was getting ads.
[03:07.66]And I thought that was the game awards.
[03:10.47]It is really quiet.
[03:12.68]Isn't it, though?
[03:13.38]I swear to God, their stream is quiet.
[03:15.29]Unless they're going to turn it up after, and this is just kind of the intro music.
[03:20.15]Mine's like laggy as well.
[03:21.82]I'm hearing a lot of like static.
[03:23.95]Static?
[03:24.54]Is that me?
[03:25.75]I don't know where it like buffers for you know, like are you watching on you?
[03:28.81]No, you're watching on Twitch.
[03:29.99]I'm watching on Twitch Uh, anyway
[03:34.33]Forget all that noise.
[03:35.55]I'm so happy to be joined again to watch the Game Awards with the greatest man to have ever lived.
[03:46.46]Uh, that's, wow, that's quite a statement.
[03:51.04]You know him?
[03:52.26]Hey, I think you're pretty, I think you're pretty cool too.
[03:54.91]How's that sound?
[03:57.01]Alright, prediction.
[03:58.53]What's in the big statue?
[04:02.69]What do you think's in it?
[04:04.92]Oh, the statue?
[04:05.84]I saw like, I've seen like three different leaks.
[04:09.27]I think there's a real leak, but I think I effectively avoided it by seeing three different variants of leaks on it.
[04:14.91]And then my chat is immediately typing what it is.
[04:17.48]So I don't like you, Kai.
[04:21.51]Wait, people already know what it is?
[04:23.99]Game of Hordes has leaks every single year.
[04:27.95]Okay.
[04:30.54]But it's three stooges in Fortnite.
[04:33.98]Dude, I'm telling you, I have so much in to the Three Stooges and Fortnite, you have no idea.
[04:40.16]Like, I'd be the guy that, oh, you know, not that there's no such thing as, you know, I'm just saying.
[04:45.60]Like, if I could...
[04:47.99]If I could buy like stock in what I am saying about the Three Stooges.
[04:53.98]The second that they're announced, oh, I'm cashing the fuck out.
[04:58.08]I'm going to be so happy about it.
[05:00.15]Um, I was dealing with the technical thing while you said that.
[05:04.09]I heard if I could get stock in the three stooges.
[05:07.81]That's pretty much all you needed to hear.
[05:10.92]I think you mean betting.
[05:13.17]Well, yeah, but I'm just saying, like, the Three Stooges shares would go crazy if they were put into Fortnite.
[05:18.87]The Three Stooges are releasing a game?
[05:20.20]No.
[05:20.96]Well, they haven't since like 1983.
[05:22.15]I'm just saying, if they ever get put into Fortnite... Oh, that's why my audio is bad.
[05:26.31]I'm on 360p.
[05:27.96]Well, get on 1080p.
[05:31.29]1080 is so 20 years ago.
[05:34.98]Alright.
[05:36.60]Number one thing you want to see at the Game Awards this year.
[05:39.41]I think we know what it is.
[05:41.28]Path of Exile.
[05:43.43]I think it's...
[05:44.94]I'm not even going to say it because it's such a meme.
[05:46.74]And I don't even really care that much anyways.
[05:48.75]Let's just be pleasantly surprised, okay?
[05:51.65]We're gonna go into this and get pleasantly surprised.
[05:53.98]Wait, so you said, what do you want to see?
[05:55.32]And then you copped out.
[05:57.71]That is what I want to see.
[05:59.08]I want to be pleasantly surprised.
[06:01.37]The following program may contain content that some viewers... Why are we getting like an Adult Swim intro?
[06:08.45]The following program may contain content that's offensive to some people.
[06:14.00]Welcome to the 2025 Game Awards Opening Act.
[06:19.26]I'm Sydney Goodman, here to start us off on gaming's biggest night.
[06:23.08]streaming all around.
[06:26.17]Yeah, I've got you at like 160%.
[06:28.98]I don't know what it is today.
[06:32.35]Dude, my stream is crashing.
[06:35.99]Game Awards Orchestra and Evanescence, surprise guests, and world premieres like
[06:45.49]Oh, I actually am excited about this.
[06:47.86]Phantom Blade Zero, Lego Batman Legacy of the Dark Knight, and many more.
[06:54.99]Plus, over 20 brand new games you haven't heard about yet.
[06:59.04]It will make you believe the universe is conspiring for you.
[07:03.04]And you know what?
[07:04.29]There's another countdown in the top right.
[07:10.46]Oh, wait.
[07:11.91]We got baited.
[07:13.08]They said it was... Oh, it's the pre-show.
[07:17.40]I thought they just did the pre-show.
[07:20.10]Well, the pre-show is not a number counting down.
[07:21.95]It's the opening act.
[07:29.28]She looks like the statue.
[07:33.49]Dude, hold on.
[07:36.04]This is a world premiere.
[07:39.01]Created on the PlayStation 5 console.
[07:41.24]Man, can you imagine how bad your game has to be for it to be revealed in the pre-show?
[07:46.38]I think this is the greatest fucking thing ever to be the first game.
[07:48.85]Actually, this does look sick.
[07:50.33]You get to be a dog and there's sheep.
[07:55.77]This is looking pretty good.
[07:57.20]I take it back.
[07:58.18]You get to be the first game.
[07:59.20]That's huge.
[08:00.35]I better hear at least one bark before this is over.
[08:03.56]We'll get it.
[08:05.49]Will we?
[08:07.62]Alright.
[08:07.84]Do you think it's going to be like a... Oh, there's a magical arcana world.
[08:11.37]There's the statue!
[08:13.28]I want more dogs.
[08:17.29]2027, that's a long way.
[08:19.84]Yeah, what?
[08:22.87]I guess that was the full game.
[08:23.80]Okay, I'll say it.
[08:24.84]The protagonist is not only powerful, but I'm proud to also confirm it is adorable.
[08:30.89]And now it's time to give out our very first game award.
[08:35.79]Here are the nominees for Best Family Game.
[08:40.29]Donkey Kong Bonanza.
[08:41.96]I don't know.
[08:42.75]Did you play any of these?
[08:45.87]We played Lego Party.
[08:48.20]You made me play Mario Kart World.
[08:51.96]You liked it though, didn't you?
[08:53.32]Yeah.
[08:56.15]And the Game Award goes to...
[09:01.42]Yeah, I was going to say based on vibes like we don't we don't fact check here.
[09:05.70]We just go on vibes.
[09:06.74]I feel like Donkey Kong look like a really good game.
[09:09.19]Wait, that's there is.
[09:10.36]and especially the Donkey Kong Bonanza development team, thank you.
[09:14.76]With this game, the team had an objective of creating a thrilling game
[09:19.42]where players could feel the strength of Donkey Kong as he smashed through obstacles and discovered how music... What?
[09:25.98]What?
[09:27.07]Dude, you already won the award you don't have to pitch me on the game.
[09:32.08]Oh, you get to play as Donkey Kong and he smashes... Like, we know you just won.
[09:37.30]Thank you very much.
[09:40.97]Dude, I saw Vinny play it.
[09:44.02]I didn't play it though.
[09:46.71]premieres ready to go.
[09:48.13]Up first is another independent game that hails from a solo developer in Sweden who's a hardcore Souls fan.
[09:56.44]He's built a brutal melee combat experience set against a gothic backdrop.
[10:02.22]Spooky.
[10:04.13]This is decrepit.
[10:05.71]That's something I would do if I was on stage.
[10:08.08]If that was me on stage, I probably would have done that.
[10:10.51]You know that's true.
[10:11.78]A thousand percent.
[10:20.26]Do you know the guy who made this plays Dark Souls?
[10:23.63]I feel like that's not really a thing you should even say anymore.
[10:25.66]I think every single person plays Dark Souls now.
[10:28.74]That's like saying, and they're a fan of Super Mario Brothers.
[10:31.67]Box guy.
[10:37.30]Are we synced up, by the way?
[10:38.93]I think so, yeah.
[10:39.86]Did you see a guy dive?
[10:41.06]Alright, stab.
[10:42.81]Yep.
[10:43.38]Perfect.
[10:49.58]This looks kind of fun, though.
[10:53.47]This looks like
[10:56.89]one of my favorite games of all time, Dark Messiah.
[11:00.65]It feels like it has that Dark Messiah quirk.
[11:03.73]decrepit built in when you have a zombie stuck in a barrel little step bro
[11:12.70]It looked like that guy was throwing a wheelbarrow at somebody.
[11:20.87]Uh-oh.
[11:24.14]Is Twitch fucked up for you too?
[11:31.25]How so?
[11:33.66]I keep, like, my streams dying.
[11:36.79]Uh, no.
[11:37.13]I've been good.
[11:39.68]Oh, we might not be synced up anymore.
[11:45.95]My internet seems to be fine.
[11:47.21]It's just my connection to Twitch's Game Awards.
[11:50.00]Oh, I clicked over onto my other monitor and it froze.
[11:54.27]I think Twitch is having some issues.
[11:56.11]What are they, 600 million people watching this right now?
[11:59.33]Yeah, view count, 700, it's actually 750,000 is a lot.
[12:06.04]Oh no, I'm...
[12:12.71]I gotta tell you, this game is like...
[12:16.34]When these lights are in other games, I hate it.
[12:20.58]You know what I'm saying?
[12:21.44]That neon pink light and that neon red light and that neon blue light.
[12:27.19]I'm not sure I would like that
[12:30.24]so you can play an AudioMag demo available on Steam.
[12:35.06]If you want to check out that demo, other Game Awards demos, and wish lists
[12:39.17]this is the pre-show don't worry we made it easy for you check out the game awards page on steam
[12:45.99]We'd like to take a moment to remind everyone that tonight's Game Awards broadcast is available on YouTube with dedicated ASL and descriptive audio feeds.
[12:55.71]What's the bitrate on YouTube?
[12:56.97]Is it better?
[13:00.20]Turn it up?
[13:01.52]You want it loud, loud as hell?
[13:02.85]This year's nominees have all demonstrated their commitment
[13:05.61]to making games that are as playable as possible by as many players as possible.
[13:11.64]And they are.
[13:12.14]Assassin's Creed Shadows.
[13:15.96]Adam Fall.
[13:17.70]Doom the Dark Ages.
[13:19.15]I wanted to play Doom the Dark Ages.
[13:20.51]I didn't play it.
[13:21.08]EA Sports FC 26.
[13:24.11]And South of Midnight.
[13:26.50]Did you play Doom?
[13:27.67]Oh, Ster's gone.
[13:28.03]And the Game Award goes to... Doom the Dark Ages!
[13:38.38]I like how they're all just kind of there.
[13:39.89]Like, no one's getting up out of their seat.
[13:41.56]Thank you so much.
[13:42.96]This is such an honor.
[13:43.87]You know, Hugo set the vision for this with the idea of creating
[13:47.89]What do you mean?
[13:49.99]There were so many options on how to play the game, everyone who streamed it was playing a different video game.
[13:55.63]Oh.
[13:56.39]Like, some people, like, they had to put in their title, like, seven different lines of like, this amount of block, this amount of parry, this amount of gun damage.
[14:05.44]User Research, QA, our dev team, our accessibility consultants.
[14:10.46]I tried to in my game crash and I refunded it and I bought it again in my game crash and I refunded it.
[14:15.73]So I couldn't access Doom, so... What?
[14:20.72]Still to come, more brand new game announcements, awards, and at the top of the hour, maybe Jeff will finally reveal what that statue in the desert is all about.
[14:30.55]I hope he can smash it with a sledgehammer.
[14:34.35]Who will also be here later?
[14:36.64]We'll be right back.
[14:37.28]New Muppet game, dude.
[14:38.34]That would be sick, considering one of my favorite games ever made was Muppet Chaos at the Carnival.
[14:43.70]As we've talked about.
[14:44.26]Which I know about you now.
[14:45.18]Of course.
[14:46.96]Guild Wars 2?
[14:48.23]Is it 2007?
[14:52.04]What the fuck's going on?
[14:56.08]Haven't heard about this in a while.
[14:57.71]Heed the clarion call as you join a community of millions.
[15:10.05]Whoa.
[15:10.45]What was all that?
[15:13.38]Dive deep and explore a wealth of lore.
[15:20.97]What was that all about?
[15:22.98]Whoa, whoa.
[15:23.90]Oh, man.
[15:26.16]You mean Owl Guy?
[15:30.13]I think that's the boss.
[15:36.39]I didn't even know that Guild Wars 2 was still going.
[15:39.58]I guess it is.
[15:40.63]I just haven't thought about it.
[15:42.07]They were doing big updates for a while.
[15:45.74]Graphics card.
[15:51.25]Oh, do you like ducks?
[15:54.48]What do you think your animal of the year is?
[16:00.79]Huh.
[16:02.24]That's hard.
[16:04.23]I want to say it's...
[16:06.80]Okay, I got a top three.
[16:08.00]It's Bunny Rabbit.
[16:10.77]Because number one bunny.
[16:13.14]No, I'm not sure.
[16:18.06]Bunny rabbit might be number two.
[16:21.60]OK, well, duck isn't my animal of the year.
[16:23.89]I think giraffe is probably number one.
[16:26.66]And then monster hogs are my number two.
[16:30.53]and then frogs why frogs because of the funny little video I have where the old lady says it's a frog in it
[16:40.52]And pokes a frog, I think.
[16:47.44]but I'm going to risk it all just for you.
[16:50.37]So here's a hint about what's coming up.
[16:53.41]There will be lots of new game announcements, including Lara Croft's return in the next Tomb Raider.
[17:00.70]New Tomb Raider.
[17:04.22]I want you to shut up for that because I'm very interested in that one.
[17:09.22]You know, time flies, you know.
[17:16.14]You really hit me with the 30 minutes at the top, right?
[17:19.25]And it's already halfway-ish.
[17:20.94]I'm able to confirm FluteGuy will be back.
[17:24.51]I mean, we're almost ready to the show.
[17:25.74]We're just getting warmed up.
[17:27.57]But for now, it's time for our three Esports Awards.
[17:31.83]The first up is Best Esports Game, presented by Game.
[17:36.42]And the nominees are...
[17:37.62]Has this ever been a different list?
[17:40.22]I'm serious.
[17:40.70]Has this ever been a different list in 10 years?
[17:42.63]Well, I can tell you Mobile Legends Bang Bang has never been on it before.
[17:46.82]Besides Mobile Legends Bang Bang.
[17:49.32]I feel like it's the same list every year.

[21:06.77]Persona 5, The Phantom X.
[21:09.01]These all feel like they're mobile games.
[21:11.33]To me, these are like games you can play on Steam right now.
[21:16.37]Are any of those actually, are they mobile games?
[21:20.18]I guess.
[21:21.65]Dude, I trust them.
[21:22.75]Do not trust them.
[21:30.28]I was hoping a horse was going to walk over.
[21:32.80]It is a tremendous honor to receive this
[21:35.27]Why would that happen?
[21:37.26]I don't know.
[21:41.18]I deeply appreciate all the wellness trainers out there.
[21:45.39]That's true.
[21:47.14]To the people who are not familiar with SciGames, we are dedicated to being the best entertainment
[21:57.29]We will promise you more wild content.
[22:00.10]People love this game, though, dude.
[22:03.01]People say, like, dude, this game is great.
[22:04.90]People are like, dude, please play it.
[22:06.64]I was like I don't know I don't know if we're gonna play that alright I think I mean this game inspired the Monster Rancher invitational
[22:14.10]It's not my ADHD, it's professional development and my ADHD.
[22:18.22]They went back in time and made Monster Rancher.
[22:20.55]to come, including two brand new game announcements from two brand new game studios right after this.
[22:29.68]Alright, well, what are your thoughts so far?
[22:32.75]My did.
[22:33.95]know for a pre-show they're really hitting us as testimony of my undying love my beloved you will honor
[22:45.12]It hasn't even started yet.
[22:46.28]Yeah, we're just getting the vibe.
[22:47.83]Is this Dragon Age Vanguard?
[22:54.62]Or...
[22:56.65]Turn the volume up?
[22:57.35]I thought we were going to an ad break.
[22:59.00]That's why I turned it down.
[22:59.78]I guess the whole thing's an ad break.
[23:02.11]Yeah.
[23:05.28]Oh, Solasta.
[23:07.94]In it.
[23:09.73]You should have saved her.
[23:13.72]you said this is dragon age of death it looked like it I think it might be
[23:24.82]Dude, my only experience with Dragon Age is aggroing like eight enemies, pausing it every three seconds, and then uninstalling the game because I couldn't do it.
[23:35.41]uh I'm sorry I'm gonna let you finish I have to add dragon age origins to my list
[23:41.89]Oh, your list.
[23:44.17]Your list.
[23:44.73]Interesting.
[23:45.48]Okay.
[23:45.80]The list.
[23:47.12]We'll talk about that when there's a period where we can.
[23:49.43]I mean, I've talked about it, but guys, I've roped him in.
[23:52.25]Oh, I didn't know you've explained it already.
[23:54.05]I did a little bit.
[23:58.05]So last of two.
[24:01.88]Good game.
[24:02.53]It's like a Dungeons & Dragons top-down type thing.
[24:08.46]Yeah, I play Dragon Age, dude, and I kind of just realized that the game had a pause feature, right?
[24:13.83]You could play in real time, but I just was doing the pause feature and I remember just looking at like 10 orcs running at me paused.
[24:20.95]and I just like this game's not for me and I just didn't play it ever again like like you lynched like you were about to get punched and you were able to exit right there
[24:30.94]You know when you're in a dream and you can like pause the dream and you're like, wait a minute, let me assess the fucking dream.
[24:38.32]I got, if I, oh my God, dude.
[24:41.23]You're gonna have to...
[24:43.24]You guys have that too, where you can pause the dream and be like, alright, wait a minute.
[24:47.36]Is this a little too much for me right now?
[24:49.23]Or am I ready to take this ride?
[24:50.55]And sometimes you actually say, I want to take the ride.
[24:54.13]This game's looking kind of cute, though.
[24:56.46]What is it called?
[24:57.13]I thought it's a tar... Oh, tank...
[24:59.58]to why can I not read that welcome back we are oh so close to the top of the hour go tell your friends to tune in and get ready for a night
[25:09.01]of awards, world premieres, musical performances, and lots of surprise guests we haven't told you about.
[25:16.68]That's called lucid dreaming?
[25:17.79]Surprise it.
[25:18.58]That's not true.
[25:20.06]I don't have control?
[25:23.05]I just can say I'm either leaving through the haunted house exit before the big scares or I go.
[25:31.30]I can't control it.
[25:32.31]I can just decide if I want to do it or not.
[25:40.06]Absolume.
[25:43.67]Blueprints.
[25:45.22]Claire Obscure Expedition 33.
[25:48.24]This is actually a stacked list.
[25:51.23]And Hollow Knight Silksong.
[25:54.89]And the Game Award goes to... Claire Obscure, Expedition 33!
[26:00.71]I wanted blueprints to win!
[26:05.14]It's almost like they came up here before they won the award.
[26:08.32]It feels like they're right there.
[26:10.17]I remember Sunfall beginning in early 21.
[26:15.10]Just four of us painting the walls of the small office we had just rented.
[26:19.94]We wanted to make a small game then, but with big ambition and creative independence.
[26:25.46]It was challenging every day.
[26:27.70]For most of our team present here tonight Expedition 33 is the first game we've ever shipped
[26:38.31]We couldn't be prouder of what this team has achieved, and we dedicate this award to all the indie teams around the world, to those who put creativity first
[26:46.40]to those who push forward with limited resources, also to those who never make it to the release, and also to those who bring extraordinary games to life every year.
[26:55.95]You make our art form richer and you continue to inspire generations of creators and players.
[27:01.76]Thank you.
[27:03.31]Are you ever going to play this?
[27:05.67]I feel like it's kind of one of those things where it's going to get nominated for a thousand things.
[27:09.97]Should you drink the Kool-Aid and just play it?
[27:13.02]I should, but I'm having a growing list lately of long games.
[27:19.44]It's gotta be a couple steps down the ladder.
[27:22.93]I think I need to finally catch up on and do Baldur's Gate 3.
[27:30.09]that blends exploration with mind-bending freeform puzzles.
[27:35.37]Oh, he hates blueprints, by the way.
[27:37.44]And you can't...
[27:38.24]There's no rebuttals.
[27:39.47]It's cute.
[27:41.34]I love a new game.
[27:46.32]Okay, sunshine.
[27:48.55]Check.
[27:49.29]Back.
[27:50.22]Check.
[27:51.18]Time for a new platforming adventure.
[28:00.04]My village was... gone.
[28:03.79]All I wanted was to go back home.
[28:06.15]The guy who made this played Dark Souls.
[28:11.41]And just to let you know, the person that made this game
[28:20.59]who likes The Legend of Zelda.
[28:30.33]You can turn it into an explosive?
[28:44.15]I really transformed myself.
[28:47.20]This thing is amazing!
[28:49.52]Made a bunch of new friends.
[28:52.72]Pick up new wheels.
[28:55.31]Figured out how to think big.
[28:58.16]And smoke.
[29:02.58]I think I like this game but not the trailer do you think so I think the gameplay parts are looking slick
[29:17.29]But I think next year Badger could be animal of the year at this rate.
[29:27.64]What is going on right now, though?
[29:39.37]okay yeah that did it for you I didn't really do it for me but that did it for you
[29:47.47]I like when he was the little ball and it grew into the big ball.
[29:50.67]That was the moment I was like,
[29:52.46]And yes, that is actor Evan Peters playing the role of Bradley the Badger.
[29:58.96]I have one more world premiere for you.
[30:02.35]It comes from an incredible brand new studio in Osaka, Japan,
[30:06.84]This is a wholly original new world coming in 2026.
[30:11.77]And we're excited to share the announcement and the first look at gameplay with you.
[30:33.10]Oh he's singing this!
[30:44.86]even carried an illusion.
[30:47.76]Shattered dreams, no theme, no soul.
[30:54.80]Is he a zombie or not?
[31:05.93]What is the game?
[31:12.76]I don't know.
[31:25.00]The stupid never dies, never died away
[31:34.60]He's wearing more articles of clothing than I own in my whole wardrobe.
[31:40.78]I tell you what I love.
[31:41.81]I love the both arms out to the side, lean in, head shake.
[31:45.45]You know what I'm talking about?
[31:46.89]There's a lot of those.
[31:48.30]You go like this and you're like really telling somebody how it is.
[31:52.44]Like the arms out.
[31:53.92]Tell them how it is.
[32:01.89]This looks kind of fun.
[32:04.89]He's a dog now.
[32:12.59]It looks a little muddy, but... That's a fair descriptor.
[32:22.19]Crack 50.
[32:26.51]I cannot solve that capture.
[32:28.08]That's not the name of the game.
[32:28.88]I need glasses, dude.
[32:30.09]I thought the name of the game was Crack 50.
[32:32.00]you hyped for the main show, then maybe you're the problem.
[32:36.32]That was Stupid Never Dies from GP Track 50, a studio made up of action game lovers who have worked on titles such as Devil
[32:44.11]Dragon's Dogma, and Resident Evil, creating action games for action game fans.
[32:51.28]Okay, we're minutes away from the main event.
[32:54.22]We have one more award for you.
[32:56.33]A category that celebrates other media that took video game IP and made movie and TV magic.
[33:03.38]Here are the nominees for Best Adaptation.
[33:07.98]A Minecraft Movie.
[33:10.34]Devil May Cry.
[33:11.30]Alright, what are you going with here?
[33:14.74]That's the adaptation.
[33:16.77]I can tell you it's not The Last of Us Season 2.
[33:21.31]Ooh.
[33:23.50]Devil May Cry, I think.
[33:28.44]uh did you see who won are you like 10 seconds behind
[33:34.70]I'm probably 10 seconds behind.
[33:37.33]I feel like if I refresh, it's going to run ads again.
[33:39.30]I'm just going to do it.
[33:43.78]Fans of video game fans, this opportunity wouldn't exist without you.
[33:47.62]Rigged.
[33:48.90]Thanks to all the support we got from PlayStation Productions, Sony Pictures, HBO.
[33:53.73]I feel like there was more adaptations than that.
[33:55.60]Netflix or Paramount or whoever our streaming overlord is now.
[33:58.43]I guess they were all last year.
[34:00.02]Like, I'm getting an ad for Fallout right now.
[34:02.25]I have game adaptation.
[34:03.46]Adaptation trauma.
[34:04.44]I really do.
[34:05.15]They were all so bad for so long that I don't give a fuck anymore.
[34:07.80]I haven't seen a single adaptation in like 15 years.
[34:10.31]They really threw themselves at this and did their best to bring our world to life in live action, and we're super proud of what they've done.
[34:17.57]Thank you to the Game Awards.
[34:18.42]Thank you very much.
[34:22.04]congratulations The Last of Us Jerma was telling me you haven't seen a movie in like three years
[34:29.63]which means it's time for a new beginning.
[34:33.27]The Game Awards main event is imminent.
[34:35.54]With big awards, even more world premieres, and amazing performances,
[34:40.55]surprise guests that even I don't know about because if you guys remember, I violated my NDA earlier and they decided I couldn't be trusted.
[34:49.68]But, you know, you can trust me to be absolutely losing my mind when we get to Lara Cross' long-awaited return.
[34:57.78]the announcement of the next Tomb Raider, which is just minutes away.
[35:02.31]And that's just one of the announcements we've told you about.
[35:05.85]there are a lot of other ones that are wait there's a new tomb raider all I get to see yeah do you think it's going to be gritty and real or is it going to be a return to you know anyway thank
[35:15.65]Thank you for going on this journey with me and congratulations again to all the winners so far.
[35:20.93]Trust me, the fun is just beginning, so buckle up.
[35:25.03]The 2025 Game Awards starts now.
[35:30.08]Alright, plug in, dude.
[35:34.78]-2 Ster take.
[35:36.69]It was a question.
[35:40.02]Thank you.
[35:48.66]Blueprints is such a great game.
[35:51.24]I love Blueprints.
[35:52.45]I hope it gets something.
[35:57.94]Well, you're gonna have to keep wishing.
[36:04.67]Because Blueprints was too long ago, it was like too early in the year for anyone to remember.
[36:09.41]Those golden mics!
[36:19.05]That looks like a Team Fortress 2 item.
[36:28.97]Oh,
[36:39.94]What do you think they're arguing about?
[36:41.87]I dunno.
[36:43.13]What game is this?
[36:45.97]Expedition.
[36:47.96]Oh that would make sense to have any context at all.
[36:51.48]I don't even play video game.
[37:02.96]Thank you.
[37:14.33]I don't even...
[37:16.18]I'm realizing now, I don't even know the first part of what the plot of this game is even remotely about.
[37:22.16]You don't?
[37:22.91]How have you avoided knowing what actually the very first tagline of what the game is?
[37:28.51]You have no idea.
[37:29.47]I'm totally in the dark.
[37:34.62]I wonder, did I get like spoiled and I thought it was a tagline?
[37:37.25]I'm afraid to say what it is.
[37:38.42]I have no idea.
[37:41.99]Did I get the last chapter of the book?
[37:44.40]I know, that's why I'm afraid to say anything.
[37:46.87]Because somebody may have told me the last chapter of the book and that I thought it was the tagline of the game.
[37:55.22]Is that what's correct?
[37:57.17]The thing everybody's saying?
[37:57.98]That's like the Steam description of the game, right?
[38:07.78]don't say it.
[38:18.25]I mean, when a game like this gets this much critical acclaim
[38:23.81]These aren't super popular genre games, but they're always insanely good.
[38:27.48]It kind of reminds me of when Disco Elysium was sweeping and winning so much stuff.
[38:31.91]That guy was going crazy on the guitar, by the way.
[38:33.96]Did you hear that?
[38:36.28]So, you know, I'm...
[38:37.61]I'll play one day, but it's gonna be like 20 years.
[38:42.67]That's what I'm saying is I feel like not playing it is weird, right?
[38:48.40]Because I feel like I would probably love the game.
[38:52.97]But are you going into it?
[38:54.39]This is the problem with like when too many people like something and you go into it thinking like, well, this is obvious.
[38:59.49]This has to be the best game fucking ever made.
[39:01.45]And then you get all this hype around it.
[39:02.76]You're like, wow.
[39:03.30]And then you find like a technical bug that happens in the first 10 minutes.
[39:06.11]You're like, well, I thought this was like one of the best games ever.
[39:09.03]Oh, my character's, like, foot went through the stairs?
[39:11.32]Yeah, like, I clipped through the ground there.
[39:12.72]What the fuck are people talking about?
[39:14.55]Oh, zoom in.
[39:15.84]Look at these textures.
[39:17.59]and to embrace change.
[39:24.46]Sometimes we paint the bars of our own prison.
[39:33.85]You chose a hard road for yourself.
[39:38.96]Are we synced up this time?
[39:43.12]not not even close tell me like what shows up okay
[39:47.51]Seven people change the world.
[39:51.03]Look at her.
[39:51.95]I know baby.
[39:55.07]Guitar.
[39:55.67]Oh my God.
[39:56.13]I'm like three or four seconds behind.
[39:59.09]Okay, ready?
[39:59.93]Donkey Kong.
[40:02.69]Oh, yeah, that was bad.
[40:05.99]We can work with this.
[40:08.08]To new beginnings.
[40:12.87]This is a crazy trailer for whatever game this is.
[40:14.74]This is a kind of multi-genre game.
[40:16.28]What is this one?
[40:19.09]Like Batman and shit?
[40:20.98]What game is this?
[40:23.40]You know me, headmistress.
[40:26.65]I know enough to get into trouble.
[40:33.81]Is this what my tomorrow will be?
[40:35.64]For those who come after.
[40:43.36]welcome to the game awards 2025. that was not a game I always thought I was serious
[40:53.35]What if I was?
[40:58.11]How much of a fucking idiot do you have to be to think?
[41:01.44]Not you thinking that, but me.
[41:03.14]like god dude it's a crazy trailer that's so funny
[41:08.37]to the Game Awards, a night to celebrate the best and discover what's next in video games.
[41:14.81]Tonight we are connected through our love of games.
[41:17.82]thousands of us here at Peacock Theater, and millions more watching around the world.
[41:23.19]in places like China, India, Brazil, in the middle of the night in Europe.
[41:27.41]I know it's late.
[41:28.17]I see you guys.
[41:29.02]Thank you.
[41:29.60]for showing up for this show.
[41:31.53]And first of all, thank you to Elise DuPont-Persquet, Lorraine Testard, and the music of Claire Obscure, Expedition 33.
[41:39.57]Kicked off the show in amazing performance.
[41:44.05]And of course, that is the most nominated game in the history of the Game Awards.
[41:48.91]Um, I'm buffering.
[41:51.50]Gonzo better come out of the fucking cannon.
[41:53.87]Gonna try and go to YouTube.
[41:55.71]Pissed off just thinking about it not happening.
[41:57.46]It's great to have you here.
[41:59.47]You know, every year this show reminds us why video games matter.
[42:04.06]They are worlds we share.
[42:06.05]stories we live, communities we build, and experiences that challenge, inspire,
[42:11.70]and connect us like nothing else, especially when life gets hard.
[42:16.61]I don't usually open up about personal things on stage, but 2025 tested me in ways I didn't expect.
[42:22.91]In January, my home burned down to nothing but ashes here in the fires.
[42:27.68]Just a few months ago, I lost my dad, who quietly sat in this audience every single year
[42:33.08]proud, supportive, always cheering us on.
[42:36.06]My mom's here tonight and we've left an empty seat beside her in his honor.
[42:40.18]Wait, am I further behind now?
[42:44.71]But in the middle of all that loss and rebuilding, this show and all of you became a source of strength for me.
[42:50.55]Are you like 10 seconds behind?
[42:53.49]I just missed a very important plot point.
[42:57.35]You missed a lot.
[42:59.31]Games have this incredible ability to hold us when we're hurting, to lift us up when we feel small,
[43:06.36]to give us somewhere to go when the real world feels unsteady.
[43:11.40]I know I'm not alone in knowing that.
[43:13.41]All of you watching tonight,
[43:15.27]You've felt that power too.
[43:17.26]And that's why we're all connected in this moment.
[43:20.32]We're here.
[43:21.28]to celebrate the artists, technicians, and storytellers who helped this medium soar to new heights.
[43:33.58]Tonight, we're going to honor over 100 nominees and celebrate a record-setting three independent titles up for Game of the Year.
[43:43.84]That's actually kind of crazy.
[43:45.19]Is that true?
[43:45.95]And we are going to have some fun, of course, too, with a whole slate of brand-new game announcements.
[43:52.46]that will hopefully get you excited about the limitless future ahead.
[43:56.82]So let's get going.
[43:58.03]To present our first award, a father and son, two remarkable actors,
[44:02.86]He is one of the finest performers working today, from Isaac in The Last of Us to Chase and Dispatch.
[44:08.61]and his son brings young Chase to life in Dispatch as well.
[44:12.81]Please welcome to the Game Awards Jeffrey and Elijah Wright,
[44:18.87]Did you play Dispatch?
[44:21.78]I did.
[44:22.20]I did.
[44:22.85]Did you like it?
[44:24.71]I streamed it all.
[44:26.42]I liked it.
[44:28.02]It.
[44:30.10]OK, well, I did not like the ending.
[44:32.97]I think it was a really cool game, except they mentioned first complaint way too many penis references.
[44:38.30]Second complaint, the ending did not hit for me.
[44:41.97]But otherwise, I really liked it a lot.
[44:48.32]particularly as games increasingly explore new frontiers of storytelling.
[44:54.79]But the reason I'm here really is standing next to me.
[44:58.12]my son Elijah.
[44:59.69]It was Elijah who brought me into the world of modern games, emphatically encouraging me to join the cast of The Last of Us Part II.
[45:12.96]And now he's joined me in voicing Chase and Trackstar in Dispatch.
[45:20.96]That was a fucking loud roar of an audience.
[45:24.43]People really like this game.
[45:25.61]Some Dispatch fans out there, I think.
[45:28.73]Yeah, cool.
[45:29.11]That is loud audience members.
[45:31.76]If it weren't for Elijah, I'd still be playing Pong on an Atari.
[45:37.36]That's right.
[45:38.19]Keep up.
[45:42.52]I can't believe I'm standing on this stage today.
[45:44.73]As an artist, I'm thrilled.
[45:47.48]I grew up with video games, and getting to work in the world of gaming has been a dream of mine.
[45:52.56]I mean, I guess it's nice that you're here too, Dad.
[45:55.67]Thank you.
[45:56.17]Thank you, Elijah.
[45:57.39]Gotcha, I got you.
[45:58.84]The next award honors games that are high octane, high action, and combat heavy.
[46:04.48]Here are the nominees for the best action game.
[46:08.43]Alright, what we got?
[46:09.13]Best action game.
[46:12.95]No.
[46:16.05]It's just no, no, no.
[46:20.38]No.
[46:21.99]We're no friends.
[46:31.36]No What is this?
[46:37.15]What?
[46:38.97]I got to give it to Battlefield for me.
[46:41.14]The winner is... Hades 2.
[46:46.22]What?
[46:49.36]I didn't play Ninja.
[46:50.70]I didn't play Ninja Day before.
[47:02.02]Hades 2 was fun.
[47:04.47]I like the first one better, but Hades 2 was good.
[47:07.05]You know, I'm so glad you said it before I did because I'd be getting all the Jerm of flack for it.
[47:13.14]I think the first one was better.
[47:14.85]I think they took a lot of things out that were good in the first one, aren't in the second one.
[47:21.24]who worked on the game.
[47:22.19]But it is still a very good game.
[47:23.35]We just want to express our gratitude to the other teams who make such incredible work in this industry and inspire us
[47:29.92]And we want to say thank you to our players who literally helped make this game what it is through its early access.
[47:35.72]Thank you so much.
[47:42.91]Okay, no matter what the next game is, can you talk about how much you hate it so that I can come in and be the good cop?
[47:49.79]Congratulations, Amir, Greg, and the whole Supergiant team.
[47:52.76]That's amazing.
[47:54.15]Alright, now we move into one of my favorite, and yes, sometimes very dangerous parts of the evening.
[47:59.21]The moment where we look ahead at what's coming next from some of the world's most talented game creators.
[48:04.34]All year long, there's speculation online about what may or may not appear on that screen tonight.
[48:10.18]And as always, my only advice is enjoy the journey.
[48:14.04]Maybe you'll witness the birth of a brand new universe or the long awaited return of a legend.
[48:18.94]That's the magic of this show.
[48:20.43]Anything can happen.
[48:22.64]So?
[48:23.38]I can title my stream that and people would not know what it is.
[48:26.17]It's time for our very first world premiere.
[48:28.56]Something truly special that we're honored to debut here.
[48:32.83]at the Game Awards.
[48:40.74]Okay.
[48:43.74]He's not impressed.
[48:49.77]I see a joystick.
[48:50.42]Is that Atari related?
[48:51.14]Is it like Atari?
[49:04.85]Concord 2 would be hype.
[49:20.16]lightsaber coming out to the side come on I think that's what it is
[49:43.60]I'm sorry.
[49:53.83]I knew it!
[50:01.15]That's Knights of the Republic, right?
[50:07.60]Boom!
[50:08.64]Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic is a brand new single player action role playing game set in the Old Republic era.
[50:15.97]of course, and directed by Casey Hudson, who's joining us here tonight.
[50:20.94]Casey was, of course, the director on Star Wars.
[50:23.07]I never played the old one.
[50:26.33]I don't know the hype.
[50:28.81]I think a lot of people have been waiting for something like that.
[50:35.17]Now, don't clip my reaction to that thinking that I'm some kind of Star Wars guy.
[50:38.42]You know what I mean?
[50:39.39]You're going to make the rounds like, oh, look at the Star Wars nerd going like...
[50:43.93]Shut up.
[50:44.91]Everyone stop talking.
[50:49.26]Hello to all of you gaming fans out there!
[50:52.88]And hello to you, my little Jeffy-poo!
[50:58.22]He wrote this script so that Piggy would hit on him.
[51:07.08]Not after Bora Bora.
[51:12.53]Which, by the way, was certainly not a bore-a-bore-a.
[51:19.45]Piggy, come on.
[51:20.51]A fucking self-insert of, oh, that's so funny.
[51:24.98]Miss Piggy, I see the open, my mom is right there.
[51:27.52]I mean, more importantly, let's move on to what you're gonna do something later.
[51:30.95]You got a really special ball.
[51:32.50]He wrote all of this.
[51:33.19]My mom is Piggy.
[51:35.94]My fucking head hurts.
[51:40.29]okay well I can't wait miss piggy we'll see you later mom's getting jealous
[51:45.57]What a freak.
[51:52.29]When are they going to announce a fucking Muppets game?
[51:54.47]They bring the Muppets every year.
[51:56.04]When's the action RPG Souls-like fucking Gonzo game?
[52:00.78]I want to play as Grover.
[52:02.79]What the fuck?
[52:04.34]They have to do something eventually.
[52:11.20]Here for survival training?
[52:12.57]Of course you are.
[52:14.94]Pathetic!
[52:16.28]Now, we've compiled some valuable training materials.
[52:19.59]so you can stand a chance against the hungry undead.
[52:23.24]Um, we can just run around those, right?
[52:26.65]Silence, both of you.
[52:29.56]Out there?
[52:30.53]You'll need more than your foolish instincts to escape the monster's claws.
[52:36.06]Or to pick a fight with a martial arts master.
[52:39.72]I do love a good fight.
[52:42.63]Is that Maximilian?
[52:47.23]His name tag says Max, if that's a clue.
[52:51.68]I'd like to talk more about the samurai and demons.
[52:55.30]Well, this is survival training, not survival talking.
[53:00.15]And lucky for all you helpless halfwits, we've cut the price on some top-notch materials.
[53:05.29]So study up, fools.
[53:08.87]Play all of these before Requiem comes out.
[53:17.78]My stream this whole time at the top left has been saying you're allowed to co-stream this and it's not going away.
[53:27.77]I just popped out the player and Jim just capturing that window
[53:36.54]Battlefield Red Sex?
[53:40.19]Wait a minute.
[53:41.26]That was that time?
[53:41.80]I'm getting fucking flashbacks right now.
[53:43.72]What is it?
[53:44.34]Red Sex?
[53:46.16]That's my t-shirt.
[53:48.35]Just forget about it.
[53:49.39]No, that was on my shirt, like in a fucking dream world.
[53:52.60]Hold on.
[53:52.92]That's weird.
[53:54.27]That was a weird dream.
[53:55.49]Oh, this is Half-Life 3, head crab cosmetic.
[54:01.89]Oh, fuck off.
[54:03.57]Oh, no, this is Soul Frame.
[54:05.12]This is the Warframe sequel thing game.
[54:08.67]Soul Frame.
[54:09.61]Okay, we did not get to see more than...
[54:11.44]one frame of that game being played never mind news for you yeah of course you do zombies are real
[54:18.73]I need new pants famous last words in a zombie apocalypse they can't hurt us if they can't catch
[54:24.89]Is anybody ever going to get shoot the zombies as a group of four people correct ever again?
[54:31.91]Uh, haven't they?
[54:34.09]I feel like since Left 4 Dead.
[54:36.50]I don't think Left 4 Dead was all that special is the problem.
[54:39.99]Well, on my top 250, it's on there.
[54:43.21]Are you saying that Left 4 Dead 2 is not top 250 on your list?
[54:47.79]No.
[54:48.97]Wow.
[54:49.94]And plenty of games, like Darktide's really good, Vermintide's really good.
[54:53.29]I don't think it's even close to Leopard Dead, though.
[54:54.89]Let me explain my take of what I don't understand, because I was not a big Left 4 Deader.
[55:00.06]What makes Back 4 Blood so much worse?
[55:02.45]Left 4 Dead?
[55:08.00]This is a whole, this is like an hour long conversation, by the way.
[55:11.30]Okay.
[55:11.71]I didn't want to be educated.
[55:14.03]Did you play Darktide?
[55:15.58]I did.
[55:16.40]And it's not better than Left 4 Dead.
[55:19.34]Hold on.
[55:19.90]Mystery.
[55:20.62]Statue.
[55:26.31]Left 4 Dead is, um, there's no, like, RNG, like, weapons, like, upgrades.
[55:30.37]It's just, the game is just a great game, and it has a million percent replayability.
[55:33.59]The difficulties are very high.
[55:50.44]That guy's gonna fly into the air from the tornado, and you can tell because of the very blatant wires.
[55:55.74]The wires!
[56:09.02]Alright, now somebody from the audience has to get pulled up too.
[56:11.12]You know what I mean?
[56:11.63]Like somebody should be like this one, like I in a suit.
[56:31.20]Oh, the Willy Wonka tunnel.
[56:32.23]Oh, Willy Wonka's game.
[56:39.97]I'm sorry.
[57:05.32]Oh, this is beautiful.
[57:46.90]Oh, no!
[58:03.47]Someone help him
[58:38.91]Yeah!
[58:51.21]What the fuck is this?
[58:53.31]It scares me.
[59:13.32]Yippee!
[59:14.12]Alright, so it's Vilarion.
[59:17.38]What the fuck is this?
[59:21.18]Larian presents Blood, Puke, and Piss.
[59:25.05]Rated R.
[59:27.73]Blood period, puke period, piss period.
[59:43.84]Divinity.
[59:45.35]Kind of weird because Divinity is not like a Dark Harbor pig slop game.
[59:53.46]Okay.
[59:53.88]They're really goofy games.
[59:55.17]That statue or monument that has fascinated the internet now has a name, the Hellstone, and yes.
[60:00.57]Larian, winners of Game of the Year in 2023 for Baldur's Gate 3, are hard at work on their next role-playing game, a continuation of the Divinity Saga.
[60:09.71]Divinity is their biggest game ever.
[60:12.72]That's right, even larger than Baldur's Gate 3, promising more breadth and depth than ever before.
[60:19.04]and we cannot wait to tell you more in the future.
[60:22.22]To present our next award, please welcome two previous winners of Best Performance.
[60:26.37]Aren't you a pretty big fan of Divinity?
[60:27.78]Maggie Robertson and Neil Dubon.
[60:30.13]Oh, it's on the list.
[60:34.86]No one is richer than the man with many cheeses.
[60:43.09]There was a lot of puking in people's mouths.
[60:49.55]For the record, Neil said that he was wearing the dress this year, so...
[60:55.70]I wash my hands of this.
[60:57.69]Anyway.
[60:58.31]I just don't know why they keep pairing us up.
[61:00.92]Alright.
[61:01.93]Right.
[61:02.45]That's Lady Dimitrescu, right?
[61:05.30]That's the big lady in Resident Evil.
[61:07.92]I don't know what her name is.
[61:10.78]Well, actually, Mags, I personally think it's the highly disciplined craft of being dramatically truthful on purpose.
[61:17.40]convincing strangers you're someone else and then winning awards for lying.
[61:23.17]I've actually based my entire career on this.
[61:25.16]We really need to have a chat.
[61:26.01]Neil, it's called comedy.
[61:27.05]Lock in.
[61:29.68]Okay, so we're here today to recognize the amazing performers who convinced us through their lies and deceit, really.
[61:39.67]that they were warriors on a quest for vengeance in feudal Japan.
[61:43.58]Dashing archaeologists with a penchant for fedoras and whips.
[61:47.64]pseudo-French revolutionaries holding baguettes for some reason.
[61:52.53]Oh, my God.
[61:55.00]They're like Wick.
[61:58.49]Oh, man.
[62:01.53]And we are serious actors here to talk about acting seriously.
[62:05.20]That's like a I won wink, you know what I mean?
[62:07.41]Like, hey, we all know who's going to take this home.
[62:09.68]Here are the nominees for best liar.
[62:11.99]I mean, actor.
[62:14.86]Best Performance I didn't make the rules between you two.
[62:21.81]I thought every single one of them was going to be Perfect Spedition.
[62:31.80]Dude, it's like the whole cast.
[62:33.78]Oh my god.
[62:37.72]These relics hold a force that could change the course of history.
[62:46.13]And the game award goes to... Jennifer English!
[62:58.06]For those of you that haven't played Expedition 33, Claire Obscure.
[63:03.15]What the fuck are you doing?
[63:04.80]Play it already.
[63:05.58]This is, uh... Or you're... What is wrong with you?
[63:07.79]This is like the Marvel movies where you have...
[63:09.37]There's, like, watching... You should have watched this...
[63:12.28]Expedition before you watched this movie.
[63:14.95]That's true.
[63:15.53]Yeah, it feels like I'm missing.
[63:16.92]I didn't see the first like five Marvel movies.
[63:20.01]And I'm expected to start watching Endgame.
[63:22.81]Um...
[63:27.57]Yeah, everyone else dressed up in like comedy French gear.
[63:30.57]Is she like not the fun one?
[63:34.19]Thank you to everyone who voted.
[63:36.87]Well, this is loud.
[63:40.69]This is not just my award.
[63:44.18]This takes a village, and oh my God, I love my passionate, beautiful-souled, artistic, clever,
[63:53.37]Beret-wearing village, every single one of you.
[63:57.41]Guillaume Jeanne, special shout out to Charlotte and Adeline.
[64:02.59]And of course, my wonderful Ben, who has been my ride or die throughout all of this, my big brother, thank you.
[64:11.87]Thank you to my beautiful girlfriend.
[64:13.66]And I just want to say,
[64:16.88]to every neurodivergent person watching this in this room, because I know there's probably quite a lot of you, and at home.
[64:26.47]To all of you that feel like life is stuck on hard mode, this one is for you and thank you so much.
[64:33.40]to the games community and industry for giving us so many of us a home for those who come after.
[64:39.87]Thank you.
[64:42.07]I gotta play this fucking game.
[64:43.88]I don't know how, I don't know.
[64:46.99]I just have to at some point.
[64:48.26]I have to play this game.
[64:51.10]I don't know when I'm gonna do that.
[64:52.51]Now is the best time to start.
[64:56.63]I'm so... Alright.
[64:57.70]How long is this game?
[65:04.27]Incredible.
[65:04.81]Congratulations, Jennifer.
[65:06.58]From Bad Robot Games, please welcome JJ Abrams and the creator of Left 4 Dead, Mike Booth.
[65:14.54]Okay.
[65:16.36]Well, now they've got your attention.
[65:24.28]I thought Gabe Newell created it.
[65:27.57]We've been so lucky at Bad Robot to get to work with some incredible artists to tell stories on stage, TV,
[65:34.39]and film.
[65:35.21]And it's been an absolute thrill and honor to have spent the last few years working with the brilliant Mike Booth on an original universe that brings our passion
[65:43.13]for great storytelling to the PlayStation and PC.
[65:46.92]Oh, no Xbox.
[65:48.50]Wait.
[65:49.20]At our Bad Robot game studio, working with our friends at PlayStation,
[65:53.52]We've been creating a new kind of co-op game that builds upon what I learned making Left 4 Dead.
[66:02.82]The result is something entirely different.
[66:04.87]Oh, he said it, he said it.
[66:06.01]I remember that game.
[66:06.93]Combat sandbox, where you succeed through cooperation and improvisation.
[66:12.90]And now I am excited to share a glimpse into what we've been working on.
[66:16.69]In fact, we're also inviting all of you to sign up for early play testing
[66:21.50]and check it out for yourselves.
[66:23.54]But first, welcome to For Loop.
[66:26.36]We're very, very sad that we came after Larian because our game is named Blood Piss Puke.
[66:33.91]We didn't plan for this.
[66:36.81]lost in less than a minute.
[66:40.37]All of this was our fault.
[66:45.77]This doesn't work for dead.
[66:49.38]And you must use our machine, the same machine that broke the world, to unbreak it.
[66:56.26]Now, I know what you're thinking.
[66:58.15]This bloke's gone insane.
[66:59.64]This plan sounds impossible, and we're probably going to die.
[67:03.31]But that's where you're wrong.
[67:04.65]Okay.
[67:08.72]It's all part of my new plan.
[67:11.81]Every time you fail, I will use our machine to bring you back.
[67:16.60]Reprinting.
[67:19.99]You can relentlessly experiment.
[67:26.74]Test strategies.
[67:28.38]Learn from your failures.
[67:32.23]You will become the world-saving team humanity needs you to be!
[67:39.97]The giant cube!
[67:47.33]Nothing is impossible.
[67:51.08]Now get out there and fail to save the world.
[67:55.27]Did you play Helldivers?
[67:57.12]I did.
[67:57.60]We played it together.
[67:59.18]Oh yeah.
[68:01.43]I guess that conversation was there.
[68:06.72]this new small independent studio is charting its own course focused on crafting uniquely styled artful games that are pushing the evolution of companion characters.
[68:16.45]Enjoy.
[68:46.90]I hope you can play as the old lady.
[68:53.90]I already like it.
[68:57.73]Mmm.
[68:59.80]Mmm.
[69:15.33]Dude, you could be... Alright, hold on.
[69:22.42]wait a minute
[69:31.26]I thought I was gonna just let it hit her in the head.
[69:39.56]It's kind of like The Last Guardian, but you're an old lady.
[69:45.68]Wait, no, yeah, you're not the last, you're not the guardian.
[69:53.49]Old people can just do that.
[70:04.32]Okay.
[70:27.13]I like a grandma witch.
[70:28.65]Yeah, I'm down.
[70:29.42]Yeah.
[70:34.66]Come talk to me first!
[70:36.55]What the fuck?
[70:38.18]I can explain what's going on!
[70:53.81]Whoa.
[70:55.70]I like this already.
[70:59.19]Did you play Soma?
[71:00.76]No.
[71:02.93]Very good.
[71:05.90]Your father thought he knew.
[71:08.69]But it inspired him to grant wishes.
[71:18.08]That's why all of us are here.
[71:20.44]You want to understand, to know.
[71:23.55]Then you have to step beyond the walls around you.
[71:28.74]Play your father's game.
[71:31.60]Push the very limits... ...until you know reality itself.
[71:41.03]That looked kind of weird.
[71:52.10]That was kind of crazy looking.
[71:54.05]Alright, that was like a blood puke piss game without it being in the title.
[71:57.65]Do you know what I'm saying?
[71:58.88]That was Ontos from Fractional Games, a sci-fi mystery and spiritual successor to Soma, set on a repurposed hotel on the moon.
[72:06.82]And yes, the unmistakable Stellan Skarsgard will star in the game.
[72:10.82]Alright, there's more Game Awards.
[72:11.81]but right now, it's time to reveal a new forceful void hunter in HoYoVerse's hit urban fantasy ARPG, Zenless Zone Zero.
[72:19.75]Meet Ye Shuang Guan,
[72:21.29]first ever dual form.
[72:22.87]I want to open boxes.
[72:28.67]I said it before and I'll say it again.
[72:36.46]Four years ago, I said when they were talking about all this stuff in this universe, I said, I wish I could buy stock in this fucking company.
[72:42.91]Four and a half, five years later...
[72:45.88]God damn it.
[72:47.06]Do you know what I'm saying?
[72:49.09]I know what you're saying.
[72:49.73]I know you're trying to exploit
[72:55.28]the kawaii anime girls for all their monetarily worth.
[73:00.55]I just saw, I just saw how popular this was getting.
[73:03.39]I saw how many people were playing it.
[73:04.52]And I'm just like, this is, people like this.
[73:05.96]People, they had the three of the games coming out.
[73:08.25]I think that's before Honkai Star Real came out.
[73:14.11]From within this horde, many others are hiding beside me.
[73:27.97]One instance.
[73:34.58]Sometimes I just want to read my chat out loud, but I know it wouldn't like vibe well with yours.
[73:39.91]Okay.
[73:43.54]It's like friend group B I'm not in your group chat over there
[73:51.78]You're the connecting thread.
[74:02.80]Alright, come on, let's get, I'm so excited for this game, even though I do.
[74:12.85]Would it be kind of a hot take if I was more excited about Resident Evil 9 than I am about Dustbloods?
[74:19.74]no the the last couple of Resident Evils games and even the remakes have been like 10 out of 10s
[74:28.53]And Duskbloods is like, I don't know, trend chasing kind of goofy.
[74:33.82]Like, I'm not convinced it's going to be...
[74:37.36]It's just so weird that it's on Switch.
[74:40.07]Do you feel like that FromSoftware was just like, we have this idea for this kind of Nightreign-esque game.
[74:45.68]We're going to make two of them.
[74:47.58]And hopefully one of them is good.
[74:49.49]Do you think that that's what they were thinking?
[74:50.78]Like, let's just fucking make the same game twice.
[74:53.53]And this one might be better.
[74:54.49]That one might be better.
[74:57.12]I don't know.
[74:57.64]I wasn't in the boardroom, man.
[75:00.54]It's gonna suck on Switch?
[75:03.53]I don't know.
[75:06.40]I'm sure it'll be fine.
[75:14.53]They just feel very similar.
[75:19.07]The games are just very similar to each other.
[75:20.84]It's in a weird spot because they really haven't shown very much of it either.
[75:25.77]Yeah.
[75:25.86]I think it's very easy to be skeptical of Duskbloods.
[75:29.33]Is the OG team on Duskbloods?
[75:31.32]Interesting.
[75:32.49]has always been about creating the experiences that will inspire human connection.
[75:37.90]And tonight's game for Impact nominees embodied that spirit.
[75:42.31]Through stories of nostalgic childhood memories, diverse culture and identity,
[75:49.43]and grief and healings.
[75:51.42]These games remind us how interactive art brings us closer together.
[75:57.34]Here are the nominees.
[76:00.15]Games for Impact.
[76:08.62]I've never had any friends like you.
[76:14.98]We forgot for a reason.
[76:17.16]It's not safe out there, Hazel.
[76:19.07]If I was the one missing, she wouldn't stop looking.
[76:30.35]And the game goes for South of Midnight.
[76:38.98]I dated a guy who worked on...
[76:42.79]Hold on.
[76:43.29]I dated a guy who worked on...
[76:46.27]Wander stuff for three dates.
[76:49.40]Oh, shit.
[76:50.11]Well, that's...
[76:51.09]Okay.
[76:52.86]There's no more info?
[76:53.79]Did it go well?
[76:54.57]That's it.
[76:55.19]That's all the info we have.
[77:02.58]No, I'm reading chat.
[77:05.92]Oh, not you?
[77:06.58]I'm just like saying that to you.
[77:10.89]Oh yeah, I dated a guy that, yeah, three days.
[77:16.07]Thank you so much.
[77:16.53]So you dated him for three days or he worked on it for three days?
[77:18.78]I'd love to share this award.
[77:20.57]That's true.
[77:21.10]That's how I interpreted it first.
[77:23.07]As you said, for three days, like he only like he got fired and
[77:26.61]No, I read it as you only were in the relationship for three days?
[77:30.11]From the start.
[77:35.34]We listen to stories passed down
[77:38.78]porch to porch, kitchen to kitchen, to build a world that would feel as warm and as rich as the South.
[77:50.24]A world that would be filled with compassion, kindness and courage.
[77:58.88]So we're incredibly excited to launch this spring South of Midnight on PlayStation 5 and Switch 2.
[78:08.26]Thank you so much.
[78:09.75]Have a great night.
[78:10.91]Merci.
[78:17.00]Yeah!
[78:18.23]I said I did I wanted to play that game when it came out but I think it had performance issues or something and I didn't but it's a very visually stunning game and I'm glad that they won and even though no one really knew what anything was in that category
[78:27.23]I mean, it looked cool.
[78:29.66]It looked visually very interesting.
[78:33.33]Alright, I need you to shut your mouth.
[78:36.88]to survive against impossible odds.
[78:40.09]How many quips do I get?
[78:45.48]None.
[78:45.97]Okay.
[78:46.15]we're excited to dive deeper into the game and some of the surprises that await.
[78:59.43]Don't.
[79:11.00]Whatever happened to transformative content?
[79:21.41]It hasn't been easy.
[79:30.63]But after much effort, here we finally are.
[79:35.64]Who are you?
[79:37.50]I know now that you're the one that I've been searching for.
[79:40.16]The special one.
[79:42.35]The chosen one.
[79:44.80]Miss Ashcroft.
[79:54.25]That's not Wesker.
[79:57.87]Hey, shut the fuck up.
[80:00.04]I'm serious.
[80:06.05]Hey, I just got a report of a missing police officer.
[80:10.76]It might be unrelated, but he disappeared near where the fifth body was found.
[80:15.18]Is that John Cena?
[80:17.15]Is John Cena in the game?
[80:18.21]Is that like a big reveal today?
[80:19.94]Come on.
[80:20.50]Through you.
[80:23.78]Albus can finally be set free.
[80:29.56]Oh, not Elvis?
[80:31.06]I thought they were reanimating him.
[80:32.09]Alright, stop.
[80:32.69]No more.
[80:33.09]No more talking.
[80:33.53]The team has settled on a person of interest.
[80:35.84]Someone with ties to Umbrella.
[80:40.47]Victor Gideon.
[80:49.37]Grace!
[80:51.21]Rubies!
[80:55.77]Victor purchased a building after Umbrella went under.
[81:00.07]I'll send you the address.
[81:10.71]Welcome.
[81:12.82]Dr. Gideon has been expecting you.
[81:23.84]Oh.
[81:25.82]Yeah.
[81:26.89]Oh.
[81:35.23]Hey, over here.
[81:37.76]I thought he shot her in the head Don't do anything stupid
[81:47.37]Me?
[81:49.12]Never.
[82:00.36]Oh, you get to play as Leon!
[82:07.40]No fucking way!
[82:11.31]Oh, they, I think they, did they swap it up here?
[82:14.53]Is it like a, you actually play as Leon this whole game, or is it like a...
[82:17.99]That was right.
[82:18.60]Leon Kennedy, one of gaming's most iconic characters, is back for Resident Evil Requiem
[82:23.85]The story in Requiem will intertwine the fate of two playable characters.
[82:28.29]Grace's storyline takes players through a unique survival horror experience
[82:31.85]while Leon delivers explosive action to the game.
[82:35.88]That's a pretty fucking cool idea.
[82:37.99]That's a great idea.
[82:39.06]This year has been an incredible one for independent games.
[82:41.57]We've been talking about all night.
[82:42.77]Half the game is played survival horror outside the traditional big publisher system.
[82:47.15]So we felt it was important to spotlight those visionary projects tonight right alongside the big franchises.
[82:52.51]This next game is a good example.
[82:54.16]It comes from a legendary name.
[82:55.95]in the independent scene, someone I first met back in 2007, and it's a project that has been 10 years in the making.
[83:04.09]I think that's a cool idea.
[83:06.56]Let us begin.
[83:08.39]Template, four combiner.
[83:10.60]North, a world of heroes.
[83:13.68]Can you charm that goblin?
[83:15.14]It's too far.
[83:16.19]I'll swap him out.
[83:19.01]Will the mirrors repair my soul?
[83:22.79]Will I pass the test?
[83:25.24]Is these people talking to each other like E3 style gameplay people talking or is this in the game?
[83:30.93]So all the rewards go to me.
[83:34.25]Because this could be a stream.
[83:35.10]That could be from like a streamer.
[83:36.06]I could have just said that.
[83:39.19]I don't know.
[83:44.41]fuse and grow we will it so who are you they all have their own puzzle powers they're very useful watch this can you push a stone back across the water
[83:54.55]That's water?
[83:57.79]Was this co-op?
[83:58.70]That would be fun.
[83:59.70]You can yell at your friends.
[84:00.91]But that's what I'm saying.
[84:01.59]Are these supposed to be people talking in game?
[84:04.12]Or voice?
[84:06.67]I had never imagined such a device that could fuse realities.
[84:11.25]Not just mashing together terrains, it weaves the very laws of nature into a composite whole.
[84:16.61]The result surprises me constantly.
[84:20.43]But who has done all this?
[84:23.42]And what do they want with me?
[84:26.24]I mean, it looked kind of interesting.
[84:27.53]You can like looks like it's a huge puzzle game.
[84:31.26]We're like connecting little squares and puzzles.
[84:35.23]I trust them.
[84:36.15]Good track record, good ten years.
[84:41.49]Okay.
[84:43.34]Has Jonathan Blow just been sitting in like a closed off room just making puzzles every day?
[84:50.41]He's like, I finally got it.
[84:52.40]Sounds like it.
[84:53.04]I've got 1400 fucking puzzles this time.
[84:54.96]I haven't seen daylight in 12 years.
[84:59.10]Exodus carries that tradition into the stars.
[85:02.04]It's time to step forward.
[85:16.16]I mean he is a great puzzle maker Wizards!
[85:22.79]Is this a Magic the Gathering?
[85:28.90]No?
[85:34.01]Are you sure?
[85:35.85]They go pretty weird with magic nowadays.
[85:39.72]This is not Magic the Gathering, dude.
[85:42.72]I think you'd be surprised if you look at some of the new sets.
[85:50.40]Child of Orion, fulfill the purpose for which you... You'll know if SpongeBob shows up.
[85:55.66]And seize your destiny.
[86:03.41]Our world is dying.
[86:08.51]You are the only one who can wield celestial tech and find a cure.
[86:15.75]Dude, that was a third person, by the way, Leon.
[86:17.69]That wasn't first person.
[86:19.16]That was a third person shooter.
[86:24.07]The fuck?
[86:28.89]with the right ship and the right crew wasn't leon playable in one of the newer ones I don't follow him that close
[86:36.38]not for a long time not since um six I was I must have been like one of the remakes I guess yeah
[86:50.32]We are the defenders of Leiden's future.
[86:54.72]And we will fight to protect it.
[87:00.09]The fight for survival has consequences.
[87:04.85]How far are you willing to venture?
[87:07.43]I got a take for you.
[87:09.36]How much are you going to sacrifice to save your world?
[87:14.08]We have so many like space bright purple laser games of just like we have to save our planet and world.
[87:21.22]No pressure there.
[87:22.04]Where the fuck are the Stone Age games?
[87:23.47]I want to throw rocks at people and shit.
[87:24.88]Like, why are there not an equal amount of those?
[87:26.43]We always go like a thousand years in the future.
[87:28.31]Why don't we go like a thousand years in the past?
[87:29.96]I want to like make fires and stuff why are they why they're not like 10 of those per game awards
[87:34.89]Do you know what's weird is you're getting trues and you're getting plus twos.
[87:38.47]When I talk, your chat says shut up, sir.
[87:41.14]My chat doesn't say shut up, Jerma.
[87:42.97]but you've been saying you are sick of space games for like four game awards in a row I know
[87:50.92]So it's just compounding every year on top of itself.
[87:55.75]You had the year where you were like enough games on like
[87:59.22]I remember this conversation.
[88:01.27]It was like, there's so many like games like on Earth.
[88:04.14]Yeah.
[88:04.60]Or you could like see Earth from space.
[88:06.43]gaming's biggest night and all we've gotten since is bigfoot's life
[88:12.88]A new Wizards of the Coast studio.
[88:14.95]And maybe like an update for like Ark.
[88:16.98]That's unlike anything I've done before.
[88:20.76]Tonight, we're giving you a first tease
[88:23.84]what we've been working on let's take a look I can't I can't argue in four years we got like this match whatever
[88:34.34]What is it?
[88:34.78]They're playing Tool?
[88:36.89]My VOD's gone.
[89:16.48]This is what they were thinking about when they wrote this song.
[89:26.45]No, it's not a puke period, blood period piss game.
[89:29.39]Not yet.
[89:46.33]D&D Warlock.
[89:51.51]No gameplay, no buy.
[89:52.50]I think Puke Blood Shit is the name of a Tool song, is it?
[89:56.56]More on Warlock coming in summer 2026.
[90:02.24]Tomb Raider with Phantom Blade Zero and a performance by Evanescence who are also releasing a new version of their hit song, Afterlife,
[90:10.31]today on Spotify alongside new video game inspired singles from Labyrinth with Sonic the Hedgehog and Bill Murray, not that Bill Murray, different one, with Cyberpunk Edgerunners.
[90:19.98]Here is your first lesson.
[90:27.99]Uh-oh.
[90:31.46]We're good.
[90:35.72]Oh, you don't watch TV, so you don't know what Edge Runner is.
[90:38.30]I don't do anything.
[90:44.72]Alright, that was cool.
[90:47.47]Pressing the keyboard and having like the... Alright, that...
[90:51.08]I...
[90:51.86]I need to...
[90:52.23]I want to see that.
[90:52.73]I want to hear it.

[91:26.05]Of the book.

[91:32.45]Splat.
[91:35.77]Not an artist.
[91:36.74]Their brands were still on fire and their hoods were made of steel.
[91:43.31]Their horns were black and shiny And their hot breath he could feel
[91:50.07]What is this?
[91:58.48]I don't know, he's cleaning up all of the games we play.
[92:02.65]Imagine how many bugs he has to fix for that.
[92:17.14]What is this?
[92:29.71]Hi, Susan.
[92:36.31]This is like reverse Toy Story.
[92:38.70]There's people in your games and they're cleaning them up for you at night.
[92:53.93]Okay, I'm gonna buy an Xbox.
[92:57.64]Because of the guy inside of it.

[94:03.72]Puke.
[94:07.23]Blood.
[94:09.16]Piss.
[94:15.60]Welcome back to the Game Awards and now it's time for a game announcement from a studio that continually pushes the limits of storytelling.
[94:23.09]They captivate us with worlds that bend reality
[94:25.56]and stories that blur the line between ordinary and the impossible.
[94:30.30]From the creators of Tetris,
[94:32.65]And whenever they show up, you know you're about to see something unlike anything else.
[94:50.79]They're just killing people this year.
[94:52.55]What I was gonna say is this is a in real life thing.
[94:56.42]We already had like people fly around the stage.
[94:59.29]Is this the same thing?
[95:00.78]actually now he's floating he's not being pulled up I mean the background is the same as the one before
[95:16.71]He's being controlled.
[95:18.38]This is like I'm shifting in my seat moment.
[95:20.39]If they cut to me right now, I'd be like,
[95:27.17]It's me.
[95:43.29]Oh persona 6 confirmed do you feel it
[95:55.37]I feel like this is how a Gaga concert started one time.
[96:06.89]Didn't she do something like the MTV VMAs 2013 or something?
[96:13.81]I don't know you tell me you dated a guy who worked on this three days
[96:28.92]an intrusive pattern... of staggering power.
[96:43.88]People are saying Ster +2.
[96:51.99]People like you dude.
[96:56.08]eventually worms its way out do you play control no
[97:09.16]Is that him?
[97:09.79]Sad.
[97:10.97]Wait, is this guy... No, this is gameplay footage.
[97:13.32]Okay, I thought they cooked...
[97:14.57]I was worried.
[97:16.19]You must have had good reasons.
[97:23.59]But we were not prepared.
[97:38.09]for what would follow.
[98:18.67]I very clearly need a recap on this game.
[98:31.82]You have like prototype vibes from this somehow.
[98:49.77]Well, it's...
[98:56.30]There you go.
[99:01.80]It's gonna get weird.
[99:07.25]You recommended I played Control when I never did.
[99:09.63]Uh, Control?
[99:10.49]I liked it a lot.
[99:13.04]Cool game.
[99:14.69]I remember that character, but I really don't remember enough to know why he's fighting a black hole.
[99:21.04]game direction.
[99:21.85]It is always exciting to have past TGA winners return to our show.
[99:26.05]to showcase their upcoming projects.
[99:28.66]Still to come tonight, we'll have a performance from Evanescence, plus awards including Best Score in Music,
[99:33.76]best narrative, best game direction, and game of the year.

[99:50.25]and Lara Croft's return in Tomb Raider.

[100:15.60]Yeah, I think someone... Because I think they have, like, another performance they're gonna do.
[100:19.28]Okay.
[100:20.46]I feel like they just tried to like upsell them on.
[100:22.93]Oh, so like we have, we could set up wires for you.
[100:25.22]It's like a thousand, whatever dollars extra for your performance.
[100:30.11]They don't know that like every other person bought it

[101:42.23]That was fucked up.
[101:44.75]That was fucked up.
[101:45.77]I just heard that as like you're talking about the game.
[101:48.33]this whole the cut scene I'm not impressed that sucks no no I'm saying like dude that's
[101:54.33]Your guy had a clear shot like fucking for 15 straight seconds and he shoots you in between the fucking eyes.
[102:01.02]He grabbed the gun so hard the guy couldn't pull the trigger.
[102:05.69]I mean, to plant one of those right here, it's like, holy shit, dude, that's what unbelievably awful timing.
[102:13.12]Gang of Dragon is deep into development.
[102:16.06]Nogoshi-san, thank you for that announcement.
[102:18.63]Alright, next up is something very cool and very unexpected.
[102:22.15]Get your quarters ready because one of the most iconic game series of all time is coming to the big screen.
[102:27.63]We're taking it back to the 90s when the ultimate rivalries were settled in the arcade.
[102:32.89]Right now, we have a special sneak peek of Street Fighter.
[102:36.76]Let's take a look.
[102:43.32]Round one, fight!
[102:52.60]Graphics are getting crazy.
[102:53.93]Street Fighter.
[103:10.09]Whoa!
[103:16.04]Is this a live action show for real?
[103:18.33]I...
[103:19.07]I...
[103:19.17]Okay.
[103:19.65]It's a lot of adaptations.
[103:21.04]We've got the Mortal Kombat, Johnny Cage movie coming out.
[103:23.89]Like a...
[103:25.36]A lot of money put behind this Street Fighter thing.
[103:28.85]Dude, even Twisted Metal had a fucking TV show.
[103:31.89]This is, this is the, if you like adaptations, it's a shitload of them.
[103:35.67]It's time to meet some of the warriors stepping into the ring.
[103:40.21]Please welcome to the arena, Noah Centineo and Ken.
[103:45.86]Nice.
[103:46.85]Andrew Koji.
[103:49.12]I don't know why I thought these two were going to have a fake fight in character.
[103:52.43]That would be cool.
[103:55.45]Here we go, Roman Reigns on Hawaii as Akuma.
[103:58.94]Perfect.
[104:00.16]David Desmalchen as M. Bison.
[104:04.86]Cody Rhodes as Kyle.
[104:07.01]Fight!
[104:09.49]Andrew Scholes as Dan Huppigy.
[104:13.60]Ben Uchawal as Dhalsim.
[104:16.59]You win.
[104:17.83]Orville Peck as Vega.
[104:21.21]Olivier Richters at Zangief.
[104:26.37]Reina Blandingham at Uli.
[104:29.32]Is it the entire cast?
[104:34.70]And Jason Momoa as Blanca.
[104:40.23]Then it goes three, two, one.
[104:41.60]and they all just start fucking brawling on the stage.
[104:51.17]They got these, like, they did the Reddit post of, like, who would you want each of these characters to be in?
[104:55.43]Like, the top upvoted post was, like, joking Jason Momoa Blanc.
[105:04.38]Reddit post.
[105:07.35]Now I know our movie comes out like a year from now, but there was no way we were showing up without a sneak peek.
[105:14.13]We just wrapped a few weeks ago, and fortunately for me, I had the distinct pleasure of kicking half of these guys in the face.
[105:21.59]legally on camera.
[105:24.22]I kind of miss that, guys.
[105:25.31]We miss it, too.
[105:26.72]As a lifelong Street Fighter fan, like legitimately obsessed, it's the only time in my career where I threatened to kill Kale if he didn't hire me to play Blanca.
[105:36.83]True story, words matter.
[105:38.70]Fucking believe it.
[105:39.47]Tell them, Ryu.
[105:40.93]It's Ryu.
[105:41.88]It's Ryu.
[105:43.15]Not Ryu, Ryu.
[105:44.88]Okay, we're also here tonight to present the award for best ongoing game.
[105:50.61]I'm not sure.
[105:55.00]The games in this category are the ones that never quit delivering all year long.
[105:59.63]They keep us looking forward to what's next.
[106:03.36]Cody, I told you, the dedication, the passion, the resilience, we need more presenters.
[106:11.31]This ain't enough, you know what I'm saying?
[106:15.07]They should be in costume.
[106:16.84]That would have been awesome if they were in costume.
[106:20.06]you all here for being great patrons of Street Fighter.
[106:23.64]Which character is that?
[106:24.54]If you played the game, make some noise in your life.
[106:26.87]Come on!
[106:30.14]There's a couple people not making noise
[106:37.43]Oh, Troy, Troy, you had an opportunity to look at the camera and go, you could have winked again.
[106:42.44]It would have been fucking perfect, dude.
[106:44.35]Oh, you should just wink every time.
[106:47.42]Yeah!
[106:49.00]Yes!
[106:51.81]I'm just kidding.
[106:52.51]I'm just kidding.
[106:53.10]They didn't come.
[106:53.62]They don't care about you.
[106:54.38]They only care about money.
[106:55.86]Okay?
[106:56.55]We care about money and you.
[106:58.37]Street Fighter forever!
[107:00.50]For ever baby, forever!
[107:03.50]He's joking!
[107:05.56]Alright, okay, so these are the nominees for Best Ongoing Game.
[107:09.89]Woo!
[107:11.22]I don't even know what just happened, but I feel like if I did, it would have been cringe.
[107:16.07]This is why I said to only give one of them a microphone.
[107:20.68]Why?
[107:21.07]they all have a microphone.
[107:22.81]In rehearsal, I said, do I have one microphone and they could hover around it.
[107:38.57]Was this best ongoing?
[107:39.67]Ongoing, yep.
[107:45.00]Oh, the mic's not coming out of the floor.
[107:46.44]I thought it was coming out of the floor.
[107:48.87]And the game award goes to... What is wrong with this guy?
[107:53.09]No Man's Sky!
[107:55.96]You're holding the mic!
[107:58.94]I think there are five microphones up there.
[108:02.27]I think we were getting... That was a quadruple microphone scenario.
[108:08.22]Hey, thank you for the award.
[108:10.65]We did all of this to avoid lawsuits.
[108:15.71]We promised a lot.
[108:18.88]And you just kept going from there.
[108:20.03]I heard this game's actually fucking good, though.
[108:24.16]It is.
[108:25.00]I'm really looking forward to the new one, the Light No Fire.
[108:28.21]The whole team at Hello Games who have poured so much into No Man's Sky.
[108:33.49]I also want to especially say a thank you from Sean, who for family reasons wasn't able to be here tonight.
[108:39.43]But I know he's probably watching this in whatever time zone it is where he is.
[108:44.64]I'm slightly jet lagged myself.
[108:46.51]He talks exactly like Sean.
[108:48.73]I think this guy's being controlled to accept this.
[108:52.88]Way more nerve wracking than he makes it look when he gets up.
[108:56.48]um,
[108:58.27]But you know, just that our tiny, massive, impossible space game still means something to so many people.
[109:08.16]that we get to keep on making a game that we love.
[109:11.48]That is a real privilege.
[109:13.69]that we are able to be here on a stage surrounded by so many incredible games.
[109:18.85]Like, that is really special.
[109:20.89]And, you know, the whole team is so grateful.
[109:23.00]It means the world to our team.
[109:24.40]So thank you so much.
[109:27.93]Dude, you know what kind of award I want to see?
[109:31.07]I want to see, like, the iron brick award.
[109:35.23]And this award goes to people that had literally no fucking patches on their entire game.
[109:40.47]And it's still, it was awesome.
[109:42.30]It's just like, yeah, I patched it once.
[109:47.13]It was a couple of typos.
[109:49.18]I think you could nominate for like the iron brick, like solid iron brick.
[109:53.64]No man's sky.
[109:54.92]And how about the Street Fighter cast?
[109:56.59]That was absolutely wild.
[109:58.22]Alright.
[109:59.39]I'm thinking who would get that?
[110:02.14]I don't know.
[110:03.25]That's why it would be interesting.
[110:06.39]Like highest rating with like lowest amount of patches to the game.
[110:11.72]from the Batcave all the way from Gotham City, Batman.
[110:16.06]Welcome to the show.
[110:16.88]How you doing, buddy?
[110:17.67]It's great to see you tonight.
[110:18.75]You having a good time?
[110:19.87]Commissioner Keeley, sorry I couldn't make it in person.
[110:23.82]I've been trying to decide what Batsuit to wear.
[110:26.68]Abs or no abs?
[110:29.51]Anyway, great show so far, but it's about to get even better.
[110:33.31]because it's time for a new look at my upcoming game, LEGO Batman Legacy of the Dark Knight.
[110:41.28]Batman out.
[110:45.39]Make sure he stays secured at all times
[110:57.57]You wanna see a magic trick?
[111:02.30]The city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.
[111:08.68]I suspect this is going to be an absolute banger.
[111:12.23]It must be destroyed.
[111:14.35]Did you play the old Lego games?
[111:17.44]Oh, the Star Wars one.
[111:19.87]sleeper hits they were fun let's get to work
[111:30.38]I think we can help each other.
[111:37.75]This town deserves a better class.
[111:40.11]You can play as Leon?
[111:41.15]Good evening, Gotham.
[111:45.09]Join us in a celebration of absolute chaos!
[111:51.59]People said I'm full of shit because you said we had to beg you to play Lego Star Wars.
[111:57.67]Yeah, but I still liked it.
[112:00.94]That's like being like, I don't like sushi.
[112:02.47]I hate sushi.
[112:03.13]I'll never eat sushi.
[112:04.12]And then finally I try a piece and I go, mmm.
[112:09.56]Why you can't have that experience either.
[112:12.61]This is my favorite part.
[112:21.21]Ha ha ha!

[114:13.35]It's like, yeah, we know.
[114:14.29]Yeah.
[114:15.32]We're anticipating.
[114:24.85]Okay, did this game come out already?
[114:30.23]Yeah, like 40 years ago.
[114:32.08]No, I'm saying the one that just came out like right now.
[114:38.38]Was it any good?
[114:39.01]I like beat-em-ups.
[114:53.13]Release her.
[115:02.80]I have a challenge for you.
[115:11.14]I accept.
[115:12.12]We both have to make a 30 second fake ad for like a computer peripheral and whoever makes the more epic one wins.
[115:19.74]That's kind of funny.
[115:26.93]No brand names, like literally just like, we need to make the best computer ad.
[115:33.15]Come up with like a fake product and... Yeah.
[115:38.04]And this is literally like a 10 to 12 second spot.
[115:40.59]Like a 15 second TV spot.
[115:44.35]Even that takes a lot of work if you want to do all your like crazy camera spins.
[115:53.80]Rust Mobile?
[116:02.23]I can't imagine playing Rust in an iPhone screen.
[116:07.77]I feel like that'd be like too much to have to look at.
[116:11.19]I can't imagine playing Rust in 2025.
[116:22.13]Hi, friends.
[116:23.24]I am thrilled to be here tonight to present the TGA Game Changer Award.
[116:27.19]an award that recognizes an individual or organization that has demonstrated positive social progress in the gaming industry.
[116:34.13]And I'm even more thrilled that tonight's honoree is one of the most impactful organizations uplifting girls today and one that I'm honored to represent as an ambassador.
[116:43.33]Girls make games.
[116:48.52]Over the past 12 years, Girls Make Games has empowered over 8,000 girls aged 8 to 18 from
[116:54.56]all around the world to create and share their own video games through summer camps, workshops, and game jams.
[117:01.15]In 2022, GMG established a college scholarship to bridge the gap for young women as they entered college and careers
[117:07.96]in the games industry.
[117:09.83]True to their mission statement, the founders of this incredible organization chose two inspiring members of their community
[117:15.74]to accept the award on behalf of Girls Make Games.
[117:18.92]And I'd like to invite them to the stage and hear how GMG truly has been a game changer in their lives.
[117:25.23]Please welcome Ellie Friedman and Monica Paredes.
[117:28.47]Is the MST3K reboot any good?
[117:31.26]I know that she's in it.
[117:32.18]The what?
[117:33.87]Mystery Science Theater 3000.
[117:35.10]They remade it like a year or two ago, right?
[117:38.03]Oh, I have no idea.
[117:41.95]I haven't given it a chance yet.
[117:44.62]Hey you guys!
[117:46.30]Hi, so Ellie, you've been going to GMG summer camps for several years now.
[117:50.51]And this past summer, you and three friends created a game that won the grand prize, is that right?
[117:55.77]Yeah, our game is called Paper Trail, and the premise is you're a kid who's stuck in the hospital with a broken arm.
[118:04.29]Draw when you're bored and your drawings that you've made have now come to life and started attacking you.
[118:10.60]You have to go from room to room solving puzzles in order to escape.
[118:14.71]And we wanted this game to be creepy but not too scary so that everyone can play.
[118:19.11]I love it.
[118:20.01]And what is next for Paper Trail?
[118:22.48]Soon we're going to start working with professionals to fully publish our game on Steam and PlayStation.
[118:29.77]Very important.
[118:35.69]You know what?
[118:37.33]I'm personally super excited to see the prototype.
[118:40.24]Look Outside wasn't even on any of the indie...
[118:43.11]They weren't even nominated, were they?
[118:44.76]I mean, hopefully with my daughter.
[118:45.86]I don't think so, no.
[118:46.35]Because she's actually the brave scary girl, games girl, not me.
[118:50.33]I like to play cozy games and grow virtual turnips.
[118:52.88]Do you have turnips in your game?
[118:54.25]Which that should be, you guys should all go look outside, go to Steam page.
[118:59.27]different with GMG.
[119:00.82]You never went to the camp, but you actually were one of the first recipients of the college scholarship back in 2022.
[119:06.71]Is that right?
[119:07.37]Yeah, so I grew up loving video games.
[119:10.21]Love all that you do.
[119:11.34]And then my...
[119:14.71]My high school robotics teacher actually encouraged me to apply for the scholarship.
[119:18.19]He knew I was interested in game development.
[119:20.18]Then I got it, now I'm attending USC and I've been doing some game development.
[119:26.69]And now I've actually had some game development experience with our club there, Open Alpha at USC.
[119:33.19]That's amazing.
[119:34.66]It sounds like it's really helped you, set you up for success.
[119:38.68]Is there any message that you'd like to give girls out there
[119:40.75]Some stuff has kind of fallen through the cracks, it seems like, if you think about it.
[119:44.08]I think if you're someone out there with an interest in making a video game,
[119:47.80]explore it, give it a shot.
[119:49.47]You never know where that interest could take you.
[119:51.28]And there's a ton of amazing programs like Girls Make Games.
[119:54.42]I'm not even sure last year.
[119:56.76]Satisfactory wasn't nominated at all organization like this when I was a kid, but I'm very excited that starting next year, my eight year old daughter can go to GMG
[120:04.31]It's been a whole year and I haven't let it go.
[120:10.55]I think the dev just celebrated like 75,000 downloads for Look Outside.
[120:15.14]So it's not like, oh, 20 million copies.
[120:18.35]to present the TGA Game Changer Award to Girls Make Games.
[120:22.09]Congratulations.
[120:23.34]5,000 is a lot of sales and a lot of, but it's not quite like 5 million, 10 million, 2 million.
[120:30.81]I think it should have a fucking million downloads.
[120:42.68]Thank you so much Felicia and congratulations to Girls Make Games.
[120:46.40]It's an incredible program.
[120:47.58]I've had the chance to visit their summer camps in the past and it is truly inspiring.
[120:51.78]See the passion and the creativity that these young developers bring to the medium.
[120:55.44]Initiatives like that don't just open doors, they shape the future of our industry.
[120:59.56]in a positive way, and I have no doubt that some of the girls in that program today will be on this stage in the years ahead accepting awards for the games they helped create.
[121:10.96]Now, it's time to move on to our next announcement here at Game Awards.
[121:15.90]Ooh, announcement.
[121:20.40]I thought you said not the actual game.
[121:23.14]I was like, why are you showing this?
[121:24.65]This is a different game?
[121:25.43]Yeah, this is separate.
[121:30.39]Cross the threshold to Atlantis.
[121:36.97]I've heard a dozen tall tales that say you're unstoppable.
[121:44.43]I think I'm about to win the previous bet.
[121:47.42]You think someone's going to be floating around in the ceiling?
[121:49.79]must come to an end
[121:54.87]Alright, would you check the box if it was... Hey, we can do a guy hanging around like on wires from the ceiling routine.
[122:03.54]Would you check yes?
[122:06.14]Yes.
[122:06.75]Alright.
[122:06.97]Well, this is too hard.
[122:08.49]I asked earlier if Tomb Raider was going to be gritty and real or arcadian.
[122:12.41]You said real.
[122:13.45]that's yeah this is pretty in arcade wait what'd you say you said real I didn't give an answer I was told to shut up I did I tell you to shut up
[122:23.31]No, I was told bad take for asking the question.
[122:26.16]That's what it was who told who this is somebody else in the call who he talking about and
[122:30.93]Um, yeah, dude.
[122:32.94]I'm schizophrenic, man.
[122:33.97]I'm hearing shit.
[122:35.66]It's only me and you here.
[122:38.09]Are you reading my chat?
[122:39.69]Because this is not the actual game.
[122:42.00]As I looked out at an ancient world reawakening, my mind traveled back.
[122:48.84]He's reading my chat.
[122:51.71]To where this story began.
[122:56.12]And everything changed.
[123:01.38]Oh no, when they pan out like this, somebody starts hanging from the ceiling.
[123:05.71]Uh oh.
[123:07.92]I feel like if they were to do it, that was the game to do it with.
[123:13.08]I mean, it looks good.
[123:20.80]Lost worlds.
[123:23.53]Frozen.
[123:24.20]Yeah, but this isn't the actual game.
[123:25.67]I know.
[123:28.93]New discoveries, waiting behind every door.
[123:37.52]across every chasm.
[123:46.50]Dinosaurs?
[123:51.18]Wait, it's Lara Croft versus the dinosaurs!
[123:58.08]Heck yeah.
[123:59.04]Max Payne?
[124:00.49]Okay, this game actually just became intriguing to me.
[124:07.64]this is what I'm talking about we got so many serious lara games it's time for like a goofy dinosaur shooter
[124:17.14]There were dinos in the old one, too.
[124:20.36]I guess that's right.
[124:22.09]Yeah, there were, like, saber-toothed tigers and...
[124:25.51]Lions and bears and stuff, right?
[124:32.14]Yeah.
[124:32.62]Sorry, Lara Games.
[124:33.65]I call her by her first name.
[124:34.83]I like know her.
[124:37.93]There was a T-Rex in the second round.
[124:40.78]That looked pretty fun.
[124:43.79]Kind of jumping around like Sen's Fortress.
[124:45.64]That looked kind of cool.
[124:48.40]There you have it, not one but two Tomb Raider games.
[124:51.67]Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis, a reimagining of Lara's iconic debut from 1996.
[124:57.10]for the 30th anniversary in 2026 next year.
[125:00.04]and Tomb Raider Catalyst, a brand new game and Lara's biggest adventure yet in 2027.
[125:06.19]And now for something completely unexpected.
[125:12.73]I expected this.
[125:22.59]Crunchy Wunchies?
[125:24.00]Oh, I like this already.
[126:06.17]Ooh, I'm grabbing the worm.
[126:09.40]Grab the worm.
[126:14.31]Is this like that you're the grabber bot or something?
[126:17.36]You just walk around and just grab stuff?
[126:27.17]He had arms in the ship.
[126:35.25]I hope they just keep adding like weapon elements, like more arms to the top of the screen and more guns.
[126:42.00]It looks kind of cool.
[126:43.01]I'm not going to lie.
[126:47.52]The For- wait, The Forest 3?
[126:51.45]Hi, I'm Robert Kirkman, co-creator of Invincible, and I'm here to introduce a brand new character to... Hey, Game Awards!
[126:57.84]Sorry, Robbie K. I got this.
[126:59.85]I see you, Keeley.
[127:01.78]Love what you've done with the place.
[127:03.67]Rex, I was just here to introduce a world premiere.
[127:06.15]Look, I am the world premiere.
[127:08.16]Cue the lights, cue the orchestra, cue the seething jealousy, and meet...
[127:13.29]the second best character in our 3v3 fighter, Invincible Versus.
[127:18.41]Roll it, Kirky.
[127:19.56]What the fuck?
[127:20.62]I said roll it, Kirkman.
[127:23.04]I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
[127:28.84]You don't know my name now, but you will once this is over.
[127:31.99]Well, I don't think I know.
[127:32.83]I only saw season one.
[127:35.41]Uh, who is she?
[127:37.38]She may be some minor Earth hero.
[127:40.33]My name is Elemental.
[127:44.52]You seem pretty cool.
[127:46.65]But that won't stop me from kicking your ass.
[127:54.42]Call this minor?
[128:05.73]So are you going to play this at Evo?
[128:07.18]Like, you going pro?
[128:10.88]I don't know about that.
[128:23.08]You don't have to pretend to be interested.
[128:24.77]Wait, when did I... What, because I went like this?
[128:26.55]...of an upcoming game coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2.
[128:59.14]That's great.
[129:08.81]Wait, they put this game on the Mario Kart device?
[129:12.69]Yes.

[132:30.06]With like brown rice and broccoli.
[132:35.33]That was like a lot of foods, but my food of the year is salmon because this is the year I realized I like it.
[132:41.66]One of the best foods in the world.
[132:45.20]That's crazy that we share the same food of the year.
[132:47.25]That is crazy.
[132:51.07]What is this?
[132:51.65]What is this?
[132:53.11]Withering waves.
[132:55.81]We did promise to witness it together, didn't we?
[133:00.04]I...
[133:00.14]I want you there to witness it.
[133:02.49]The rise of the new sun.
[133:06.46]That's why I was asking what your food of the year was.
[133:13.89]I wish if I took a nice big dump
[133:16.18]I could come out of the bathroom and just like have all that shit happen around me.
[133:19.12]You know what I mean?
[133:19.56]I could just like spin around and be like, look, I feel great.
[133:24.91]In that moment only?
[133:27.06]Is that a prereq?
[133:30.23]There's other moments you could do it, but...
[133:37.78]Oh, this is the Vinny game.
[133:41.14]There's like one guy that looks forward to Metroid games and it's him.
[133:46.42]I don't know anything about these.
[133:49.79]I stopped really...
[133:51.50]Metroid for me was...
[133:53.39]I remember the one for Wii.
[133:54.70]Metroid Prime.
[133:55.32]And Metroid Prime 2?
[134:00.28]I've been so out of that since like 10 years ago.
[134:07.42]The new one's kind of mid.
[134:09.00]I don't know.
[134:11.27]I really don't have an opinion.
[134:12.82]I have no metric.
[134:13.86]Earn them by playing the stuff you love Then trade them in for the same.
[134:17.94]I just I haven't played a switch game I played like one
[134:22.52]or up your game with limited edition merch.
[134:28.12]Victory is yours.
[134:29.51]And so are rewards.
[134:32.02]Victory is mine.
[134:33.17]Do you remember that?
[134:34.61]That just flashed my brain.
[134:36.70]When I said that I wanted to... Every time we beat a Nightreign boss, I wanted to soundboard...
[134:41.17]play victory is mine uh from stewie and you really you hated that you were so upset about it
[134:47.07]I don't think I commented I don't think I responded to you saying that I think you were just like I don't even want to listen to this I just took it all in
[135:00.72]I think you got dead silence from the crowd on that one.
[135:03.71]I did.
[135:04.05]And you think you got an applause.
[135:06.33]No, no, I was applauding myself.
[135:08.40]I was like, I'm just happy about this.
[135:09.98]Your own internal applauses were so loud you thought I reacted to it.
[135:13.92]Yeah.
[135:15.27]I didn't.
[135:16.62]Dude, there were cheers going on up here and it just bled into that was you as well.
[135:31.22]Yes
[135:38.89]Okay, for the 100 year anniversary, are we going to do a best game of the last 100 years?
[135:46.24]Your hatred grows.
[135:48.73]Look around, would-be heroes, influencers, executives.
[135:56.90]You go for that trophy.
[135:59.05]Death, decapitation.
[136:03.38]You know better, Riker, Shroud.
[136:07.24]You've corrupted more minds than even I can imagine.
[136:14.18]of this crucible of jealousy.
[136:17.57]Impressive.
[136:20.53]Yep, yep, this is Diablo 4.
[136:25.83]Yeah.
[136:32.20]yikes I think we're gonna get somebody in the ceiling
[136:45.97]We'll be back.
[136:54.63]Did you finish the last expansion?
[136:56.26]Oh, wait, hold on.
[136:56.70]This is going to be the best part of this whole thing is that they have a trailer for it.
[137:14.15]and escape the flood.
[137:26.46]You shall talk in the world no longer.
[137:44.60]Is Mephisto Jesus Christ now?
[138:11.88]who believe that they alone can stand against the inevitable.
[138:33.26]I'll invite them to try.
[138:47.69]I want to be excited for that, but...
[138:50.55]I played the whole last expansion.
[138:51.85]I think if you played the last expansion...
[138:55.91]Your expectations should be below zero.
[138:58.93]It is great to have Blizzard here at the Game Awards.
[139:01.38]Want to know who else is here?
[139:02.62]Well, it's time for an update from Marvel Rivals, a nominee tonight for best ongoing game about the latest Marvel heroes.
[139:10.10]It's one of my favorite franchises ever.
[139:11.73]And if this was a different period, maybe I'd be so excited about that.
[139:16.56]But that last expansion was dog shit.
[139:20.09]It was dog shit.
[139:22.28]I'm not even going to buy it on day one.
[139:25.20]And that's fucked up.
[139:31.04]they left the story in such like a comically weird place there's no way to take it like any bit serious
[139:40.09]Even if you're like, I just I want to see what happens next.
[139:42.36]It's like I do Deadpool.
[139:49.84]Alright, you rejects.
[139:51.90]Get Tyrannosaurus Wrecked!
[140:02.53]Dinosaurs are making a comeback.
[140:04.48]You think he's a tank?
[140:13.97]Oh, I didn't even know this was for Marvel Rivals.
[140:16.96]I was kind of thinking about Diablo 4 and happy that there were dinosaurs.
[140:25.87]I have three boobies, baby!
[140:28.19]Yeah!
[140:29.02]Now, why'd I do this again?
[140:38.17]She's my rival.
[140:45.03]That's cool.
[140:46.51]Their animations are always crazy.
[140:49.85]Let's go.
[140:54.14]I love the character designs in Rivals.
[140:56.30]I think they're very, it's like kind of the original styles that are just modernized a little bit.
[141:01.02]I think they look good.
[141:01.56]I have the pleasure of playing Dr. Selina Tan, head of the Tactical Simulations for QLab in 007, First Light.
[141:10.84]James Bond has long had the fortuitous, some might say daring habit
[141:15.84]of crossing paths with rather dashing antagonists.
[141:19.80]And this one is undoubtedly unforgettable.
[141:23.04]Take a look.
[141:24.01]Are they going to make a good 007 game since, like, 2001?
[141:27.08]I mean, this is just, this is a Hitman sequel.
[141:31.57]Oh.
[141:34.40]you're getting the day one mod where it replaces his character with hitman like the pre-ordered bonus we're pre-ordering hitman never
[141:45.96]I am sometimes asked, Baphma, how is it that you hear every whisper in every corner of Aleph?
[141:53.94]And I answer, I built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole self.
[142:01.79]This city is an extension of my being, my body.
[142:07.57]Today, it became infected.
[142:10.82]Lenny Kravitz?
[142:13.47]Easy, girls.
[142:14.48]Plenty of meat for everyone.
[142:17.14]Girls.
[142:18.95]Of course.
[142:20.98]Girls.
[142:24.34]Girls.
[142:25.87]thought that was in the trailer himself four-time grammy winner lenny kravitz
[142:37.21]I don't know why I thought he was gonna fly in.
[142:43.56]You're so waiting for it.
[142:45.31]I am.
[142:52.04]It's going to be Miss Piggy.
[142:53.39]It's going to be Miss Piggy.
[142:59.82]first voyage into the world of video games.
[143:07.23]When IOI invited me to play Bhawma, a wild, unpredictable pirate ruler of Africa's biggest black market hub,
[143:16.51]I knew I was stepping into something special.
[143:19.51]Where others see chaos, Bhavma sees freedom.
[143:23.45]He rose from nothing.
[143:24.55]He's wearing the outfit.
[143:26.98]How does Ryu come out on the stage?
[143:29.66]and his story is just this is an easy cosplay just wear a bathrobe and every world boxing gloves
[143:35.95]needs the power of rhythm through music.
[143:38.56]That would look like such shit.
[143:39.71]These musicians can turn violence into beauty.
[143:43.34]and silence into tension.
[143:46.55]Here are the nominees for Best Score
[143:49.79]and music I do love that suit though best score in music leveled up by Spotify
[144:06.31]Oh, I'm sorry you all lost.
[144:15.44]And look outside.
[144:21.33]Look outside.

[147:05.96]And a big thank you to Sandfall Studio for their trust and unwavering support.
[147:12.92]Thank you, everyone.
[147:14.20]Tomorrow comes.
[147:16.32]And then someone comes down on the wire and they want to say something too.
[147:21.54]Do you think that if you get nominated for like 10 different categories, you should just not win any of those categories?
[147:27.52]What we do instead
[147:28.96]is they just give you the Platinum Diamond Award.
[147:33.50]And there's a whole segment where we all talk about it for the Platinum Diamond game.
[147:40.12]from brand Turtle Beach, Lenovo, Samsung and more.
[147:46.20]Please welcome from Warframe,
[147:48.55]Hey, if you don't like it, make a better game.
[147:50.30]And they got 10 straight minutes to do whatever they want.
[147:59.34]Hello, Game Awards!
[148:00.68]Hello!
[148:01.99]Rev, how many registered users is Warframe at?
[148:05.54]That's an inside joke for Warframe Twitch chat, Megan.
[148:07.81]Alright, hi Twitch chat, hi Game Awards.
[148:09.90]We're here for Warframe.
[148:11.69]We launched our biggest update
[148:13.87]of the year, the old piece just yesterday, and all things considered, the update went smooth.
[148:19.86]not here to finally announce that we're coming out of open beta 12 years later.
[148:25.02]No, we're still in beta, 12 years, and you know, in those 12 years, all we have learned is that Ben Star will do anything for money.
[148:37.42]But in all seriousness, we have an amazing community of Tenno and Warframe and now envoys with Soulframe.
[148:44.90]I just want a dozen Troy Baker cuts.
[148:51.92]of what is Warframe.
[148:53.93]You love that guy.
[148:55.96]He's just too smooth.
[148:57.02]He's just so smooth.
[148:58.51]Which it still is.
[148:59.60]And we clung to the tagline, ninjas play free.
[149:03.19]But it's time to let a legend tell you what is Warframe.
[149:13.82]What... is Warframe?
[149:19.15]Don't you have like 10,000 hours in this game?
[149:27.41]I'll do this the whole thing.
[149:28.49]I can't play.
[149:30.76]I'm on the naughty list.
[149:36.27]Names that echo an ancient purpose now lost to them.
[149:42.86]The war they were created to fight
[149:47.18]And yet... ...they wake.
[149:51.64]They Ster.
[149:54.66]What drives them?
[149:56.93]Their residual instinct?
[149:59.18]or some separate conscious force.
[150:03.18]We may not know, but there's one who does.
[150:07.79]They hear her voice, a blanket against the horror.
[150:13.02]They insist blindly upon humanity and its worth, even in the face of ultimate indifference.
[150:21.39]but with so little understanding of what they have taken, what they still owe... to me.
[150:30.60]Tristan!
[150:31.38]Wake up, Tenno!
[150:39.75]uh that clip plays every day in the morning and then once or twice in the afternoon and at night it's driving me crazy
[150:49.74]Wait, what?
[150:51.87]What clip?
[150:53.21]I'll tell you later.
[150:56.75]Tell you later.
[150:57.99]It's this Brazilian politician that's doing a speech and he gets a cop in the middle of it and I thought it was real.
[151:08.25]where his voice goes down, and he sounds like a cod zombie, and he's like, shite-stuffing.
[151:14.17]And then he starts talking about how he needs some mint, and he's like, and he sounds like a demon, and it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my whole life.
[151:21.23]Okay, I'll...
[151:22.87]You don't have to show me.
[151:24.27]It's just, you have to go watch it.
[151:26.55]And imagine thinking that that really happened.
[151:30.90]What, that he turns into a demon?
[151:35.89]And it's a whole thing, dude.
[151:37.74]It's got a bunch of lore behind it.
[151:38.88]It's a lot.
[151:40.29]It's hilarious, though.
[151:41.27]Okay.
[151:41.59]I'll have to deep dive.
[151:49.04]Do you see what I'm saying?
[151:52.41]I think a 10 second spot like that, I think we could do it.
[152:14.86]You know, the problem is that when you come up with these like dumb ideas of like, well, let's do this like bit and we'll make a video and we'll do this.
[152:21.39]I can never just like.
[152:24.63]just do it in a simple way like I'll turn into a werewolf you know what I mean yeah
[152:32.00]On its surface, it's like, oh, cool.
[152:33.81]Yeah, like a 12-second little spot.
[152:35.97]In my head, I'm already like, this will take me all day.
[152:38.16]Is a werewolf a furry?
[152:41.50]Um, there's a scale from 1 to 5 of how furry you are.
[152:46.33]Uh, werewolf is a mythical creature, it's not a furry.
[152:49.81]game store right now.

[153:24.58]Lamp bearer.
[153:26.83]That is the most scathing review you can give a game.
[153:29.98]You haven't even had a chance to see it yet, and you're just like, another one?
[153:34.96]Dude, lamp bearer is how that opened.
[153:40.22]Bearer of the curse, curse bearer, tarnished lamp bearer.

[154:08.37]I remember their last trailer had some like really like why is this music here type of trailer.
[154:20.56]I mean, it looks good.
[154:23.21]I think I said this about the last one too.
[154:24.84]It looks great.
[154:27.35]The last one was good.
[154:29.32]It's one of those Souls games, though, that was like...
[154:34.33]just wants you to die it was a little frustrating before it I think that was my problem with it I think I got to the first one was the one with all like the wood planks and you have to jump across it was just like

[156:57.22]Good evening.
[156:58.66]More than Claire of whatever 33.
[157:01.87]From the amazing teams at Housemark and PlayStation.
[157:05.73]For the last 30 years, the Housemarque name has been synonymous with thrilling action, satisfying gameplay, and of course, bullet hell.
[157:13.78]It's been an honor working with them, not just as an actor, but as a fan of Stardust, Returnal, and literally everything in between.
[157:21.24]We cannot wait for you all to play when Saros lands next year.
[157:24.10]And here's the debut of our new story trailer.
[157:36.92]The sun is forever.
[157:40.83]That's a plus one for me when they rendered the hairy legs.
[157:43.83]We promised we'd never be apart.
[157:55.55]It was promised!
[158:01.95]I need to know that I just made the right decision.
[158:04.78]It's me, boss.
[158:05.74]Wait, how?
[158:07.19]How long?
[158:07.66]Since the last time the sun died, mate.
[158:12.37]You've left us here!
[158:14.42]We've lost people!
[158:15.85]There's... there's no way to get home, and you... Life!
[158:20.00]This is what it does.
[158:21.95]It gets in our heads and it twists and it turns.
[158:30.88]What the hell?
[158:37.09]Did you just wake up?
[158:38.92]Yeah.
[158:41.20]What's this?
[158:42.89]It's Returnal Debs.
[158:47.08]Cool.
[159:01.14]Saros looks great.
[159:02.26]It's coming next April, and I'm very excited that Rahul is starring in it.
[159:06.97]To present our next award, I am honored to welcome a previous TGA winner,
[159:11.26]He's the writer and director of some of the biggest and most critically acclaimed video games of all time.
[159:16.61]Grand Theft Auto 3, 4, 5, Vice City, San Andreas, Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2, and Bully.
[159:24.22]He's the co-founder of Rockstar Games and now the founder of a new studio, Absurd Ventures, where he is busy writing and creating novels, comic books, animated series, and yes,
[159:33.66]two big upcoming unannounced open world games.
[159:36.85]It is my honor to welcome to the TGA stage for the first time an industry icon, Dan Houser.
[159:43.30]Oh, shit.
[159:55.48]Hey, Dan.
[160:00.32]GTA 1 is on my top 250.
[160:02.43]Thank you.
[160:03.31]Good evening.
[160:04.02]It's a real pleasure to be here.
[160:05.77]In the 29 years I've been doing this, we've seen games emerge as the premier art form of the 21st century.
[160:13.43]More than any other medium, video games have the power to take the audience on a journey both physically and emotionally.
[160:20.23]Games don't just tell us a story, they let us live it.
[160:23.22]The story becomes the experience, driven and shared by the player's choices.
[160:28.27]It's a level of shared authorship that's unique
[160:30.76]I hate when they explain games to us like we're fucking toddlers And so here are the nominees for Best Narrative Best Narrative
[160:41.75]One stroke, and everyone of that age vanishes into nothingness.
[160:47.01]This thing between us, it was a mistake.
[160:51.35]So that's not a spoiler.
[160:52.64]Find every last member of the Yotei Six and I will bring you peace.
[160:56.62]I always dreamt of leaving this place, becoming more than a peasant.
[161:04.80]I want to play Silent Hill F.
[161:10.20]And the Game Award goes to Claire Obscure, Expedition 33.
[161:20.85]It's going to win every major category.
[161:25.51]This is just Return of the King all over again.
[161:33.42]I hope they bring out the same page and read it again.
[161:35.89]Like a smirk on their face, like, yeah, you have to let us do this.
[161:44.03]Wow, there are a lot of people here.
[161:50.39]Hi.
[161:54.60]There are so many people to thank, but first and forever is my husband.
[162:02.42]He is my light in the darkness.
[162:05.01]Thank you to our beautiful player community.
[162:09.83]Thank you for welcoming our characters into your hearts.
[162:13.50]In games, a story is a shared creation.
[162:16.65]It starts with words on a page, but the player experiences it through the work of each of our teams.
[162:22.53]What if it doesn't win Game of the Year?
[162:24.01]I don't know.
[162:25.66]Why are there so... Why are these sleeper emotes on the screen?
[162:29.39]What is this?
[162:31.42]Wait, what?
[162:33.89]All of that is supported by our producing and our technical teams.
[162:38.88]The last ingredient is our players.
[162:42.32]who interpret the story in the context of their own lives and who keep our story alive through their own creative expression and discussions.
[162:51.87]The marvelous thing about games is that we create that experience together, our team with our players.
[163:00.21]Thank you so much.
[163:08.29]Yeah, it's kind of like the Yankees problem.
[163:10.98]You know what I mean?
[163:12.80]There's this team in baseball there that wins every time, and everybody doesn't like that they win all the time.
[163:17.86]Oh, Tom Brady.
[163:19.96]It's just like you... For a limited time only, Prime members can go to Amazon.com slash The Game Awards to save 20%.
[163:27.43]I think this was a kind of slow year, too.
[163:31.19]Bundled with a 12-month play pass and travel case.
[163:33.91]Yeah, but the Yankees are amazing.
[163:35.84]My game of the year is K-pop demon hunters.
[163:37.77]Like, there just weren't enough games.
[163:39.04]The next game from a small studio in Uppsala, Sweden.
[163:43.30]Neon Giant known for The Ascent.
[163:45.77]This is No Law.
[163:52.91]Port Desire.
[163:54.06]And then everyone's like, yeah, fuck the Yankees!
[163:56.26]Even if, like, the Yankees are a good team.
[163:58.29]I was one of those people.
[163:59.12]And by the way, like, let me make it really clear.
[164:00.78]Fuck the Yankees.
[164:01.55]Who gives a shit about that team?
[164:03.46]Red Sox Nation.
[164:04.80]Until I'm fucking buried in the ground.
[164:08.98]The mayor stepped in where the government couldn't.
[164:11.98]Said the city needed order, and they'd be the ones to bring it.
[164:16.04]Keeping the peace on their terms.
[164:21.39]I walked away from it all, kept my hands in dirt instead of blood.
[164:26.90]But desire is a fickle mistress.
[164:35.08]Don't forget my name.
[164:37.49]I asked for nothing, and they still came and took everything.
[164:42.67]The mares and anyone that stands in my way.
[164:45.85]Every last one of them.
[164:48.51]They're gonna learn something real simple.
[165:08.66]Dude, it's the future.
[165:09.63]You can have more than like 60 field of view.
[165:12.27]You reap what you sow.
[165:22.72]We'll all be looking forward to that.
[165:24.20]And good morning to everyone in Sweden and Europe.
[165:27.50]I know it's a late night.
[165:28.93]A lot more show for you, but coming up, we've got more awards like Best Game Direction.
[165:34.09]Todd Howard is here to present that from Bethesda.
[165:36.74]and more announcements, including one I promise you that nobody could have anticipated.
[165:42.02]I hope someone just walks out, just says, it's Claire, and then walks off stage.
[165:46.73]Netflix's Devil May Cry brought Capcom's iconic game franchise to life as an exceptional animated series nominated tonight for Best Adaptation.
[165:56.06]the show also featured a number one single from our next performers who just announced their 2026 world tour.
[166:03.45]Here to perform Afterlight, please welcome Evanescence.
[166:09.23]Here it comes.
[166:18.56]Damn, she's already on the stage.
[167:02.31]What number are they on now?
[167:07.97]Five?
[167:08.51]Six?
[167:11.09]Uh, the last one I think was five.
[167:21.38]Was that just the name of the character?
[167:33.77]used and sold out before.
[167:44.86]Oh, I missed the drop.
[168:02.93]He's smoking every time he turns the camera off.
[168:22.37]You have to do Audio Jungle.
[168:23.57]It's Evanescence.
[168:27.39]It is what it is, man.
[168:31.51]It's Duck Thursday, do you celebrate?
[168:39.41]I guess not.
[168:42.20]It is Duck Thursday, you're right.
[168:53.38]What was your official what was your official game of the year list at the end of the day when all the dust is settled?
[168:59.80]all the dust is settled it was and you know what just it doesn't have to come out this year like things you played this year like if it was Dracula
[169:09.79]Um...
[169:14.88]I don't know.
[169:15.45]I think Look Outside is number one.
[169:18.32]Blueprints is probably number two.
[169:20.87]White Knuckle is up there, probably at three.
[169:24.19]You should play that game.
[169:25.72]No, I can't.
[169:26.75]I can't play that game.
[169:29.51]pointed to me that it's still on your game of the year top three.
[169:33.81]And you're like, no, I've had enough.
[169:35.52]The climbing mechanics of White Knuckle
[169:37.46]are the best that anyone has ever made making something like that.
[169:43.91]That game is so fun to play.
[169:45.94]It's just way too hard.
[169:48.89]I think the gameplay is like a 10 out of 10.
[169:55.87]I agree with that.
[169:58.54]season two will premiere on May 12th, 2026, only on Netflix.
[170:03.13]Give it up one more time for Amy and Evanescence.
[170:05.24]That was incredible.
[170:05.96]Yeah, I mean, mine's K-pop, Demon Hunter, so...
[170:08.34]There is more Game Awards ahead, including more new game announcements, and of course, Game of the Year, presented by last year's winner.
[170:15.76]Which game will take home the trophy this year?
[170:17.61]Stick around to find out.
[170:19.02]Lauren Balth and the Game Awards Orchestra are tuning up.
[170:29.71]It always surprises me how much they have at Game Awards.
[170:33.80]There's a lot, yeah.
[170:34.69]It's like a three hour show.
[170:36.41]Three and a half hours?
[170:37.02]Three hours?
[170:41.28]This game looks fucking amazing.
[170:43.60]How good does this game look?
[170:46.37]By the way.
[170:47.01]Insane.
[170:48.57]coming up soon here in the next handful of days.
[170:52.69]I have nothing to do with this, but I'm going to do it after, so it's not part of what I was going to say.
[171:00.72]I don't want to say it over this, because then it might be like, that's not allowed.
[171:06.17]You're allowed to talk.
[171:07.33]Am I allowed to talk?
[171:09.48]I'll allow it.
[171:10.55]I think Star and I are going to do a sponsor stream on this game next week.
[171:29.46]What is that?
[171:42.08]Is this... Dude, is this actually...
[171:50.84]wait is this vasmophobia oh vasmophobia is out a few years ago but it's coming to switch
[171:59.48]Give me a sign.
[172:05.19]Are you here?
[172:08.19]Susan macdonald give me a sign
[172:12.53]That game's fun.
[172:19.46]I don't want any apps.
[172:27.19]Whoa.
[172:31.84]No.
[172:37.18]Sorry.
[172:41.24]I saw this.
[172:44.40]Wait, what?
[172:47.07]What did I just read?
[172:48.28]This is your joke from earlier about how this is like a pre-order bonus for 007 to be in the Hitman game.
[172:54.07]It's literally Eminem.
[172:57.73]It's like in the game.
[172:58.29]That wasn't even a joke.
[172:59.40]I think there was a real article saying that the way they pinched
[173:01.95]to get that 007 game was they just showed them a reskinned level of Hitman with the 007 character.
[173:09.28]Really?
[173:17.65]Hi, Los Angeles!
[173:23.64]And hello to gaming fans around the world.
[173:27.11]I'm thrilled to be making
[173:29.44]my debut in a video game as the next elusive target in Hitman World of Assassination.
[173:38.74]The hunt begins February 2026.
[173:44.66]Now, I'm happy to present the Game Award for Best Multiplayer.
[173:49.66]Modern multiplayer represents a monstrous challenge in game design.
[173:54.96]I mean imagine having to develop games that account for the absolute unpredictability of thousands of live opponents
[174:04.95]Or even worse, the persistent dumbness of a human teammate.
[174:11.14]it's no easy task and tonight's nominees all oh yeah like she plays league their own inspiring way you can tell here they are
[174:20.95]Alright, do I like any of these?
[174:24.34]Okay, should I vote for that because Poke likes it?
[174:33.53]That's tribalism.
[174:36.90]Do you vote for that?
[174:37.49]Because Holly likes it.
[174:38.61]You have to do a sprint jump.
[174:40.31]I was peeking.
[174:43.52]I don't think uh I don't know
[174:53.38]I see people have a lot of favorites out here.
[174:56.07]Who do you want?
[175:00.93]She's just going to say whatever that guy said.
[175:05.19]She looks over to him and goes, oh, good thing it's not up to you.
[175:07.87]Sit back down.
[175:08.85]And the game award goes to... Art Greiner!
[175:19.27]Please play Ark Raiders, I'm begging you.
[175:22.44]I'm not gonna play Ark Raiders.
[175:32.71]It looks like a fun video game.
[175:36.39]But I can't.
[175:37.23]I can't do it.
[175:41.39]First of all, thank you all.
[175:45.49]And on behalf of the art creators,
[175:48.61]team, this incredible team.
[175:51.74]What are these things?
[175:52.46]We'd like to thank our loved ones for supporting us and cheering us on along the way.
[175:58.85]Embark Studios as a whole because, as we all know, it takes a village for the fearless leadership of our dear Patrick Sutherland.
[176:08.78]The partners in Nexon, whose...
[176:13.82]unwavering trust in us took us all the way here and made it all possible.
[176:19.92]And of course the players
[176:21.97]whose love and engagement just means the world to us.
[176:26.84]Thank you all.
[176:29.60]You know, I think you would like this tidbit if you didn't hear about it is that they had an issue where you could like
[176:35.10]glitch into rooms that you're not supposed to be in without the key.
[176:38.56]And then they did what I would call like this is how you would fix a bug.

[177:06.61]Dark and Darker was that game but they keep that's just not the game you know what I'm saying for 25 years yeah but then they released Dark and Darker and it wasn't like fomo
[177:16.24]has entertained millions of people.
[177:20.33]all around the world with the Total War franchise.
[177:24.31]Today, I'm here to help announce
[177:27.79]where Total War is going next.
[177:31.58]And...
[177:32.90]It'll be in a universe that is so close to my heart.
[177:40.68]I'm excited to reveal
[177:43.72]that Total War is headed to the grim, dark future.
[177:50.52]With Total War.
[177:53.20]That's a good one.
[177:55.88]That's a good one.
[177:59.07]I want to cheer this.
[178:00.00]I want to cheer this.
[178:01.60]Dawn of War, 40K is on my top 250, by the way, Stuart.
[178:04.32]We'll talk about that later.
[178:05.28]Some of you may not know this, but I am a huge fan of tabletop gaming.
[178:09.10]I've painted endless miniatures, spent
[178:12.05]a crazy amount of time dropping dice under a table.
[178:16.76]Of course, as you might expect,
[178:21.23]These emotes, are you kidding me?
[178:24.07]What do you mean emotes?
[178:25.85]Like, every once in a while, a bunch of emotes fly across my screen.
[178:29.74]Do you have, like, the thing activated?
[178:32.91]I don't know.
[178:33.42]More details on that later.
[178:35.84]Let's take a first look at Total War Warhammer 40k.
[178:41.25]Dawn of War 2 sucked, Dawn of War 3 sucks.
[178:43.84]The original Dawn of War is one of the best RTS games ever made.
[178:47.27]But Dawn of War 2 sucks.
[178:48.16]Dawn of War 3 sucks.
[178:49.12]Everything else they've made sucks since.
[178:51.51]I'm sorry.
[178:52.57]That's my opinion.
[178:54.40]I'm sorry.
[178:58.62]I just started playing rogue trader.
[179:08.33]I'm trying to commit.
[179:13.46]I don't like Dawn of War 2.
[179:15.45]I know a lot of people like it.
[179:17.73]People say, dude, it's great.
[179:20.38]I don't like how they took away the bases and I don't like that style.
[179:24.01]Nope, I don't like it.
[179:25.44]Thank you.
[179:36.88]What did you say?
[179:40.73]It's nothing.
[179:42.02]You just look at chat and you're like, I was just saying I was playing Rogue Trader.
[179:45.49]It's a...
[179:48.74]Is it good?
[179:49.16]It doesn't matter.
[179:50.99]I have like an hour played.
[179:52.03]I don't know yet.
[179:52.57]I was always curious about how like the tabletop Warhammer system actually works.
[179:59.53]And I'm learning.
[180:00.53]Oh, also, it took him like 15 years to put the Tau in another fucking video game.
[180:08.44]Dawn of War, my favorite, the absolute best.
[180:11.33]I loved playing as Tau.
[180:12.73]It took him 20 fucking years to do anything with him ever again.
[180:20.11]Lead your armies.
[180:23.44]Conquer worlds.
[180:26.82]Fight on as the galaxy burns.
[180:30.34]I was Tau and Dark Eldar.
[180:32.68]Those are the two that I played.
[180:36.85]I missed out on all that because I did Starcraft and Command and Conquer.
[180:50.35]This is, that's cool though.
[180:52.21]I mean, it's a totally different game.
[180:54.91]I will say Dawn of War 40k, the original, and the expansion of that, that's one of the best RTSs ever made.
[181:01.68]It might actually be the best RTS ever made.
[181:06.13]This looks fucking cool, though.
[181:07.88]I'm not going to lie.
[181:10.02]Yeah, the Total War games have like grown a lot.
[181:13.45]I haven't played one in so long, but they
[181:16.02]are pretty good these days.
[181:32.14]The last one I played was Total War Shogun.
[181:58.29]Take a look.
[182:00.48]What a sight to behold.
[182:04.43]That's all over.
[182:07.29]The last lands of the FCU.
[182:09.65]The Federation of Central Yuzha.
[182:14.26]First of all, thank you for joining us on this ship.
[182:18.02]Hello there, my dear newcomer.
[182:20.15]You were very lucky, you know.
[182:21.91]Yes.
[182:22.75]We are critically undermanned on this ship.
[182:25.22]Don't worry at all.
[182:26.79]The man in front is Jan Rexko, the Wings of Thief.
[182:30.19]You're riding shotgun with the legendary Ace of Aces.
[182:33.53]He's our last delusion fabricated by the rumor metal of social media.
[182:37.36]Radar contact.
[182:38.18]We think it's the Shadows.
[182:40.03]Our low target is Wings.
[182:41.46]All dogs fire.
[182:42.38]Time to pull out, 22.
[182:45.14]Roger that.
[182:46.12]God damn it.
[182:49.78]Start swimming, soldier.
[182:52.34]Make it home alive.
[182:57.07]Just keep at it, Rex.
[182:58.81]Ray, heads up!
[182:59.15]On your orders, Rex.
[183:00.30]To keep Hope alive, Wings of Thief must stay on the mission.
[183:03.28]Must fly on.
[183:04.43]I can make up your kill count to be whatever.
[183:08.00]Fine from now on you'll be the greatest ace pilot this war will ever know I like how they all believe in you
[183:17.69]that's nice what was the last um ace combat when was seven has it been a long time
[183:25.70]remember the last one being six so I don't know when seven happened yes that's right ace combat is
[183:35.22]Over the past few weeks, fans have been visiting the Game Awards vote in Fortnite to help us select the best creator-made island of the year, and Genesis Squid Game came out on top
[183:45.04]Fortnite island code.
[183:48.98]Dude, you're gonna crash that guy's server!
[183:53.68]He's not ready for 15 million people to join his fucking island.
[184:05.23]I want it back the way it was no wait was that pod racing shut it down
[184:14.88]No, because it would go...
[184:21.78]didn't do that the pilots were incredible best of the best
[184:31.09]OK, well, like, who has the egg on their head now?
[184:37.37]Well, it didn't go ba-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.
[184:40.35]They fucked up.
[184:44.10]I think they should just restart the whole project.
[184:49.99]The galaxy needs racing!
[184:58.57]I remember this coming up for the N64 and it was a piece of dog shit.
[185:02.91]I fucking hated this game when it came out for the first time.
[185:10.45]I like that we're getting a lot of like hate from you.
[185:12.40]I thought the N64 game was terrible.
[185:22.77]Oh shit.
[185:35.78]Are you in your hater arc?
[185:37.91]All I said was N64 pod racers was dog shit.
[185:41.46]Dawn of War 2, Dawn of War 3 were dog shit.
[185:43.89]Um...
[185:45.82]What did I say?
[185:46.52]Something else earlier too.
[185:49.22]What were your names again?
[185:50.85]Diablo 4 was a piece of shit, yeah.
[185:59.05]It's not a hot taste.
[186:00.30]Hmm, name or namey?
[186:02.06]Yes, Naomi!
[186:03.71]And you?
[186:05.18]Batboy!
[186:06.24]Yes, children, I have a feeling.
[186:08.72]It's a feeling of destiny.
[186:11.19]Follow me, Naomi and Bagboy.
[186:13.42]Destiny awaits!
[186:18.89]That's cute.
[186:29.61]oh it's made for us I could be bag boy
[186:37.40]Such a beautiful game that was out of words, a stop-motion co-op game being developed
[186:42.85]over in Denmark and it's a great game coming next year.
[186:46.75]And now I'd like to welcome back an icon, a legend who pushes entertainment forward with each of their new projects.
[186:52.84]someone I consider a dear friend and a friend of the show.
[186:56.68]Please welcome Miss Piggy.
[186:59.67]Miss Piggy's back!
[187:04.30]Oh my god, please do a duet with Kojima, right?
[187:07.93]song this evening.
[187:09.38]No, no, no, so sorry.
[187:11.62]It's all because of my accompaniness.
[187:15.24]My accompanistas, this dog was late, as usual.
[187:22.29]Hey, sorry, I lost track of time.
[187:24.84]I was out taking myself for a walk.
[187:29.70]I love when they do the like fake laugh at the camera and just leave their mouth open and shake.
[187:35.47]It is something that every character in their universe is just like a shared social norm.
[187:43.72]The Muppets would be up there.
[187:46.92]Listen, what are you worried about?
[187:48.87]You know, we'll just wing it.
[187:51.81]Sure.
[187:53.56]Who knows?
[187:54.16]Maybe it'll all work out.
[187:56.13]How about something like this?
[187:58.29]On the tier list of everything, we're off the dog against George Washington.
[188:03.30]What?
[188:04.26]I can't just make up any words without some meaning.
[188:09.90]This is stupid.
[188:11.52]This whole thing is ridiculous.
[188:12.43]When's the last time the Muppets had anything?
[188:17.34]oh yes the game awards will never 10 years ago down good luck excuse me
[188:24.22]as we all now come together across the great divide.

[189:35.18]I need to know.
[189:36.25]The Game Awards will never let you down.
[189:38.98]But the pig just did.

[190:00.39]The Muppets, everybody.
[190:01.58]Thanks, Miss Piggy and Ralph the Dog.
[190:03.96]It all worked out in the end for them.
[190:05.41]Alright.
[190:05.91]The Game of Worlds will be right back.
[190:08.06]You know what?
[190:09.56]I respect Jeff more every day.
[190:12.02]He probably just loves the Muppets, and he's like, no, fuck that.
[190:14.21]We're giving Ralph the Dog the piano, and he's playing a number.
[190:20.15]I guess and then it's gonna cut straight to like Genshin Impact
[190:28.81]That is literally what is happening, yeah.
[190:36.02]Jeff is keeping the Muppets alive.
[191:31.55]When I get hit by a car I hope I get reborn in that world.
[191:46.72]Don't steal my idea.
[191:48.23]I'm going to have a guy laughing and smiling into a headset of mine.
[191:51.27]Don't take it.
[191:53.28]I'm doing that one.
[191:56.70]Okay.
[191:58.19]Where are you gonna get this guy?
[191:59.31]I don't know.
[192:01.41]We'll see.
[192:05.25]Switch the light, crack the door.
[192:09.57]Started wishing, found a mission.
[192:13.80]Break a glass.
[192:26.41]What is happening?
[192:28.27]It's an ad for something, a trailer.
[192:36.79]I look for gold and it turned it turned to rust
[192:46.65]Whenever something like this is playing, I've learned ultimately they're trying to sell you crypto.
[192:55.47]Is that what you think it is?
[192:57.64]Yeah.
[193:00.88]This is like NFTs or something.
[193:15.45]It's animated very well.
[193:18.07]They always are.
[193:18.99]That's the weird thing.
[193:20.14]Like there legitimately is a bunch of like crazy anime intros and it's like, buy our NFT.
[193:26.00]I don't know how they make money or what the business plan is
[193:31.69]And where this goes, I'm making it highs and lows It's an over
[193:37.19]it's a new
[193:47.02]Give me something Someone to love Someone to count these stars above Give me something
[193:57.01]what's it called is that the game where you like stand behind the girls and they they when they go to cover they put their butt up into your mobile phone
[194:06.85]What?
[194:08.32]Excuse me?
[194:08.54]That was the announcement of One Republic's partnership and a new song with Art Night Enfield, which arrives January 22nd, 2026.
[194:16.03]on PlayStation 5 pc and mobile you can pre-register what game are you playing
[194:21.89]Okay, here's another world premiere only for you here at the Game Awards.
[194:45.02]Okay.
[194:59.18]This could be one of the five Samurai games coming out.
[195:03.79]There's a baby in this one.
[195:18.89]I wish it would say, capture it on a PS3.
[195:24.84]And underneath it says, yeah, that's how confident we are.
[195:27.13]Fuck off.
[195:29.24]S game?
[195:30.18]Is that a samurai game?
[195:31.55]Is there just being that literal?
[195:33.40]I knew it.
[195:36.11]You'd never break so easily.
[195:39.65]But why did you come back?
[195:42.40]The Order's blades are coming.
[195:44.43]They failed once, they won't fail again.
[195:52.30]Have you become too rotten in your old age?
[195:56.15]Or have I just ripened up?
[196:01.38]There's a difference between rotten and ripe.
[196:06.06]You should get that... ...dot out of your head.
[196:10.90]What do they call it when you're before right?
[196:16.06]Not sugary enough to enjoy.
[196:22.41]I'm sorry.
[196:26.86]Please, take it.
[196:29.56]Save our people.
[196:33.05]The girl's nothing but a shell now.
[196:40.36]You broke my blade!
[196:45.81]But we broke your spirit!
[196:52.57]Phantom is movement, striking from where none expect.
[197:03.67]Whoa.
[197:06.67]Oh, that was cool.
[197:21.51]I like the boss design or the enemy design.
[197:24.60]Seems kind of cool.
[197:28.07]You can become drunk.
[197:44.96]Wait, that was cool.
[197:52.61]That was cool too.
[197:53.35]That guy was under the water.
[197:55.24]You can drop rocks on people.
[197:57.15]That was cool.
[197:57.97]I'm playing this game.
[198:02.97]Phantom Blade Zero.
[198:03.92]Write that one down.
[198:16.05]Thank you.
[198:26.39]That's a little bit far away, but still cool.
[198:28.95]That is a little bit of a ways.
[198:32.21]Phantom Blade Zero looks incredible and I cannot wait to play that on PlayStation and PC when it comes out next September.
[198:40.46]to present our next award few creators have changed the landscape of games the way this man has
[198:45.85]From The Elder Scrolls to Fallout, his games have helped define our industry and shape the way we explore digital worlds.
[198:52.60]please welcome the studio head and creative director at Bethesda Game Studios, Todd Howard.
[199:00.51]Alright, Todd, what do you got?
[199:02.99]Let's see.
[199:03.34]Is he going to say anything?
[199:05.79]What if he just didn't talk and he just opened it and spelled out the word?
[199:09.29]You could walk out and say Claire and then leave.
[199:14.47]He spells out the word in the air.
[199:18.37]Game development.
[199:19.83]is the ultimate team sport.
[199:22.64]And it doesn't matter if it's a team event or a team of hundreds.
[199:28.34]His hair, he's got little elf ears.
[199:31.17]He finally reveals.
[199:32.47]That doesn't have magic.
[199:38.43]And the games that have had them all come together, well, they touch us.
[199:42.74]They become a part of us.
[199:44.75]And that's why we're here tonight to honor them.
[199:48.96]Here are the nominees for best game direction.
[199:53.14]Best game direction.
[199:54.51]Everyone vanishes into nothingness.
[200:01.35]I couldn't protect you.
[200:03.75]Can anything come close?
[200:05.78]I found something new to live for.
[200:10.27]Time itself is against us.
[200:18.71]I don't think any of these even come close.
[200:21.96]This exact lineup of games was in three other categories.
[200:24.39]And the Game Award goes to... Expedition 33.
[200:31.52]And the result was the same.
[200:36.34]Everybody expected this, right?
[200:38.32]I mean, this is not shocking.
[200:41.39]I mean, it's shocking that the game, I guess, was that good, right?
[200:45.09]Because everyone's like, oh yeah, fucking Battlefield.
[200:47.96]Fucking, uh...
[200:49.63]you know uh what's that game that we just saw ghosts of you know we got that yeah this is uh quite intimidating wow uh yeah
[201:00.12]Let's get to it.
[201:03.34]Yeah, so back in Brussels in 2020, I received a mail, just anonymously,
[201:09.45]Uh, just, yeah, make a game, they said.
[201:12.05]It would be fun, they said.
[201:14.82]Yeah, what's the worst that could happen, right?
[201:17.11]Well, fast forward for a few years.
[201:20.39]Can't believe I fucking lost this category.
[201:22.19]We still look at each other of how crazy this timeline is.
[201:25.05]For sure.
[201:26.26]Don't really understand, but, you know.
[201:29.32]It's a timeline, however, where we're eternally grateful for the support and love we've received.
[201:35.15]as well.
[201:36.90]All the ones with us tonight and the ones abroad, friends and family who believed in us and made this dream come true.
[201:45.55]I love to thank my wife as well.
[201:47.60]She couldn't make it here tonight, but I think she's watching it.
[201:51.68]She's in Brazil, so...
[201:52.72]So the time difference is quite huge.
[201:56.90]But yeah, anyway, thank you all so much.
[201:59.59]Have a lovely evening.
[202:01.82]Yeah, I do kind of feel, in a way, feel bad for these devs because after this,
[202:07.79]Can your next game be like Poop Man?
[202:11.52]You know what I mean?
[202:12.24]You can't make Poop Man.
[202:14.59]That's not possible.
[202:15.19]But you might really want to make Poop Man.
[202:17.78]I think next year I'm going to watch the prerequisite movie before the Game Awards.
[202:24.80]Over the years, there have been many games, characters, and franchises we all wish would return, and certainly many I'd hope that would be ready to announce at an event like this one one day.
[202:34.79]I'm excited to share this piece of news with all of you.
[202:42.76]I know.
[202:56.42]Oh in space again?
[202:59.72]We don't know what it is yet.
[203:05.78]The world needs you again.
[203:14.09]This is in a vault.
[203:15.20]Okay, then we need the password.
[203:21.20]The way this is zooming just feels like Time Crisis.
[203:31.78]Mega Man?
[203:35.43]Mega Man.
[203:37.44]Oh, it's Mega Man.
[203:40.95]Oh, you beat me.
[203:52.25]Okay, we just fuckin' unlocked, we hacked Mega Man's password!
[203:57.38]We're good.
[203:58.25]He better not leave his laptop anywhere.
[204:18.34]I mean, what's your vibe on Tron Bon?
[204:22.01]I think my vibe on this is that they should do like a full reimagining of this franchise.
[204:27.08]I don't know if a side scrolling guy like,
[204:29.15]It still works.
[204:31.48]I think you got to get like a vacant 3D, make him a real guy, realistic graphics, but treat it the same way.
[204:37.35]It's still like cartoony.
[204:40.46]early glimpse at first gameplay.
[204:41.95]The team really wanted to share that with you tonight to show the classic 2D style that they're returning to.
[204:47.58]Game of the Year, but first an exclusive new look at the Super Mario Galaxy movie coming to theaters next April.
[204:58.75]No.
[204:59.97]I d- uh, well, let's- hold on.
[205:02.55]I'm Bowser Jr., and I'm gonna be taking my father now!
[205:06.87]Uh, hi, I'm Luigi!
[205:16.06]Okay, I gotta complain about this movie.
[205:17.90]In my mind, Bowser Jr.
[205:20.23]Sounds like this.
[205:23.20]That's been in my head.
[205:23.82]I think I heard you do this before.
[205:25.45]You're right.
[205:27.53]No, it might have been somewhere else.
[205:28.88]How could those funny little guys be evil?
[205:33.67]Not whatever that was.
[205:48.40]you play you play phantom blade zero and I'll play neo three okay and then we'll meet each other in the middle and then we'll talk like we both played the same game and
[205:58.22]I couldn't get into Neo.
[205:59.73]I really couldn't.
[206:00.55]I tried both of them.
[206:02.32]I just don't like the stance thing.
[206:03.65]I don't like the up, down, middle, down, up.
[206:07.90]I it's a lot.
[206:09.61]I love the game.
[206:11.12]It was worth learning.
[206:12.83]Wait, this isn't Neo.
[206:14.15]It is.
[206:15.80]My chat was wrong.
[206:18.22]Who said it wasn't Neo?
[206:19.20]That person was just wrong.
[206:21.23]Ban them.
[206:24.84]Was that demo in January?
[206:26.79]Mm-hmm.
[206:33.07]I'm looking forward to playing Crack 50.
[206:34.89]This war has an inevitable conclusion.
[206:39.05]One that is only a matter of time.
[206:41.59]Wow.
[206:42.13]What a cool game of my journey.
[207:00.17]It's Shadow.
[207:11.29]I think skill trees have become the new... George will remember that of video games.
[207:18.55]Do you agree?
[207:23.57]Yeah.
[207:26.02]Okay.
[207:49.81]You know, sometimes our last reveal at the Game Awards is a teaser for something years and years away.
[207:56.33]Not tonight.
[207:57.77]Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built Apex Legends and Titanfall.
[208:04.38]Four years ago, the principals founded a new independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward with a new original game.
[208:13.05]They've done it.
[208:14.08]in complete secrecy, which is even more amazing because the game is very deep into development.
[208:20.14]The power of independent self-published studios to push this medium forward is a growing and I think positive theme in our industry.
[208:27.92]And so tonight,
[208:28.91]you're not only gonna get the announcement of the game, but also your first look at the gameplay.
[208:34.08]I've played it, and after you see this trailer,
[208:37.18]I have big hopes.
[208:38.14]Okay.
[208:38.51]I like the name.
[208:44.05]They made it look like Elder Scrolls, but then they said Titanfall.
[208:47.63]They hit him with the switcheroo.
[208:50.90]Visit space!
[208:56.15]Why can't this guy be throwing rocks or something?
[208:58.30]I don't throw like, I don't know.
[209:01.11]It's kind of, well.
[209:03.54]I fight to the end.
[209:17.39]You are in a horse.
[209:24.70]Bring in the heat!
[209:34.71]Ah!
[209:40.51]Moving in for the attack.
[209:46.01]Man, everybody just wants to take from Paladin the goat without acknowledging that it was the goat.
[210:07.88]Siege tower coming in.
[210:22.57]They should have named this game Battle of the Toys.
[210:30.33]Oh, Cassidy?
[210:42.22]What is going on?
[210:53.09]I just want a game where we throw rocks at each other.
[210:54.88]Like, make that.
[210:55.73]Make the game where you throw rocks.
[210:58.45]And...
[211:01.78]I am a Warden, and this is my own.
[211:10.00]Hey, you know what the ultimate is in that game?
[211:13.51]Bite.
[211:14.17]Fire?
[211:14.61]No, bite somebody.
[211:16.02]It's like you build up your bite meter and you get a health leech.
[211:19.81]We can just go outside and play that game.
[211:29.80]It's time for our final award.
[211:32.12]Last year, Astro Bot took home Game of the Year, and so the tradition goes, this year we're lucky to have that game's director present Game of the Year this year.
[211:39.79]From Team Asobi, please welcome Nico Doucet.
[211:46.72]Asshole butt.
[211:55.80]Good evening or good day wherever you are.
[211:58.80]This is it, right?
[212:00.24]So last year we were blessed with a huge honor on this very stage.
[212:05.35]So it is with great joy
[212:07.24]that we're back today to pass this incredible award onto another team.
[212:13.81]Congratulations to all nominees tonight with your gains.
[212:16.96]You made us travel, dream, sweat,
[212:20.15]laugh and sometimes, very often cry actually.
[212:24.12]From kids to hardcore gamers, there was truly something for everyone this year.
[212:29.14]And have you noticed?
[212:30.38]The games nominated this year were created by teams from all over the world.
[212:35.93]This is a testament that our industry feeds from various world cultures.
[212:40.81]And in this day and age, this is something we should really, really appreciate and celebrate.
[212:52.35]And also, each of these games had amazing music.
[212:56.48]So without further ado, please enjoy the nominations.
[212:59.94]I was just going to cross my eyes, look in the camera and say, where's Half-Life 3, but I don't want anyone to have that clip or image.
[213:04.84]Maestro, take it away.
[213:15.96]Wait wait wait wait
[213:19.82]Remember Balatro almost was nominated for Game of the Year?
[213:23.15]What a great game that was.
[213:24.30]What a great game.
[213:25.94]What a good time to be alive.
[213:30.65]We'll be right back.
[214:00.12]Who do I want to win this if I were to wave a magical wand and they win?
[214:04.76]I got to see all the nominees first.
[214:11.74]Claire Obscura.
[214:13.88]Um...
[214:27.40]Arc Raiders, K-Pop Demon Hunters, Battlefield 6,
[214:44.48]Then it goes into terminal and look outside.
[214:48.38]Imagine that ship.
[214:51.22]I keep forgetting Hollow Knight came out.
[214:57.66]Am I meant to log in?
[215:18.01]People are getting, like, timed out over here.
[215:21.46]Oh, no, there's one guy that did all caps.
[215:31.51]I don't know.
[215:32.82]If I had the magic paper, I think I would just be like, and the winner is...
[215:41.54]And then I would just sprint off the stage.
[215:46.96]I don't know.
[215:49.93]You wouldn't say, like, me.
[215:52.54]They wouldn't be able to stop you.
[215:54.95]Everyone would remember that you were the Game of the Year winner if you did that on stage.
[216:00.01]It's gonna be...
[216:01.72]I mean, it's Expedition 33.
[216:04.39]It just is.
[216:05.64]Right?
[216:07.60]Yeah.
[216:17.72]I think gamers out there are really just excited to get something different.
[216:22.07]No, look, I'm not saying it's bad.
[216:25.50]Technically, Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders are top quality, but they're not different.
[216:30.52]We want...
[216:31.40]different.
[216:32.63]And this should be a message to all the AAA studios.
[216:35.26]Give us what we want.
[216:39.10]Yeah, no, I agree.
[216:40.06]I don't think it's a bad thing.
[216:42.89]I think that it's very obviously very unique, very well-made, very well-crafted, very fun.
[216:49.31]People really like it.
[216:50.88]Heard everybody loves it.
[216:52.48]It seems like it's got a great support behind it.
[216:55.61]I mean, what more do you want?
[216:58.20]The game's just apparently fantastic.
[217:00.15]What else do you want to say?
[217:02.22]And the game of the year is Mon Ami, Claire Obscure, Expedition 23.
[217:08.81]I thought it was something else.
[217:10.02]I was like, Mon Ami wins.
[217:12.02]What's that?
[217:14.18]What's Moni mean?
[217:18.08]Oh,
[217:23.07]Yeah.
[217:38.55]Somebody just said, it can't be that good.
[217:41.08]See, that's the problem, right?
[217:43.31]Is now you've got that in your head now.
[217:46.18]And now you're going into it and you're like, I don't know, dude.
[217:49.22]The lighting in this cave...
[217:53.13]Uh, that voice acting, I don't know.
[217:57.79]I'm going to delete everything I've ever heard about this.
[217:59.84]I'm going to pretend like I've never heard this before in my whole life.
[218:06.76]That boss fight was like, game of the century, really?
[218:10.93]I'm just going to pretend like I've never heard a single thing.
[218:12.18]Now it's at the point where every time you die in a fight, it's like, oh, game of the year.
[218:18.71]Yeah.
[218:19.94]Yeah, right.
[218:20.80]Yeah, every time you lose, you're going to be like, nah, you think this is game of the year material?
[218:27.67]This was supposed to be a joke.
[218:29.36]I have no idea what's happening.
[218:34.37]I want to thank first the incredible team at Sunflow Interactive,
[218:39.38]They are not watching from home as we brought literally everybody here to celebrate with us, so I love you guys.
[218:46.09]That's actually how I was playing Blueprints.
[218:48.97]It actually was.
[218:50.34]You see, that's exactly what we were talking about.
[218:53.91]I gassed up blueprints to him off stream and I was like, bro, it's, it's like, it's fucking great, man.
[218:59.08]It's like, don't, don't go into it slow.
[219:01.39]And he's like, this game is fucking fuck this, fuck that.
[219:04.94]Oh, what a, this Jerma game of the year.
[219:07.11]Don't tell anybody that you like anything.
[219:08.78]I also want to thank Kepler Interactive, our publisher,
[219:10.48]but also our localization teams, our playtesters, our wonderful...
[219:14.72]I thought this was a puzzle game.
[219:17.09]And all the people who worked on this game to make it happen.
[219:19.30]It's really a teamwork.
[219:20.52]So just thank you to everybody who contributed.
[219:23.21]And also, I want to extend a thank to the unsung heroes of this industry, the people who make tutorials on YouTube on how to make a game, because we had no idea how to make a game before.
[219:32.98]Thank you.
[219:34.06]It's crazy.
[219:34.99]That's crazy.
[219:40.22]And I extend a personal thank you to an important man in my life, Mr. Hironobu Sakaguchi, who made me fall in love with games
[219:48.03]and inspired me to become a game dev, so thank you.
[219:58.59]And finally, just a massive thank you to the players for all your covers, your fan arts.
[220:03.66]your endless arguing about which ending is a good one.
[220:07.09]That's wonderful.
[220:07.92]They're both cool endings?
[220:08.94]Thank you so much.
[220:09.65]He just spoiled the fact that there are multiple.
[220:13.04]So if you remember, we promised some content a few months ago.
[220:17.01]So I'm very happy to say that it's releasing
[220:19.55]Is it like a light the bonfire or don't light the bonfire scenario?
[220:25.83]First time chatter.
[220:29.27]I'm at the awards right now, LOL.
[220:31.92]Stream is better.
[220:34.66]They're full of shit.
[220:36.86]It's like, yeah, but that can't be real.
[220:44.65]Look, I mean, if you make the best game, you make the best game and that's all there is to it.
[220:51.46]I'd say that look outside and give it a chance.
[220:56.46]amazing Game of the Year winner, and that is gonna do it for the Game Awards 2025.
[221:01.47]Thank you all for watching, voting, and being a part of this community.
[221:05.06]And congratulations to all the nominees, winners, and teams.
[221:08.82]Are we going to get one more thing?
[221:10.46]we'll see you again on Friday June 5th for our biggest summer game fest ever from the dolby theater in la and we'll be back right here at peacock theater
[221:18.70]for the Game Awards next December.
[221:20.93]Thanks to our entire Game Awards team and everyone who helped make this show possible.
[221:25.05]Happy holidays.
[221:26.63]Good night, everybody.
[221:31.88]Alright, so what was your best in show?
[221:35.39]Okay, so... You will have to remember all of the things you just saw.
[221:40.84]It was a lot of things.
[221:45.45]I'll go first.
[221:46.78]You're gonna go first?
[221:48.93]Uh, Divinity.
[221:50.54]Yeah.
[221:51.67]Easy.
[221:51.99]I could see that.
[221:52.75]Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of my all-time favorites.
[221:55.89]Favorites?
[221:57.32]The only reason I haven't played Baldur's Gate 3 is because it's 5th edition D&D and Divinity System was better.
[222:04.03]They go back to Divinity and it's a darker, cooler game.
[222:06.28]I'm really excited.
[222:08.11]My take is that... Yeah.
[222:12.59]My take is... Yeah.
[222:15.12]I think that...
[222:16.55]I'm happy to play as Leon again in Resident Evil 9.
[222:21.46]I think...
[222:21.95]That's going to be really cool.
[222:23.05]I like that game with the people flying around and it was called something zero.
[222:28.94]I liked it.
[222:29.44]I think that looks kind of cool.
[222:38.89]Oh, the granny game.
[222:40.09]I don't know.
[222:40.80]Okay, the granny game, I think, would be more fun if there was more danger in it.
[222:47.34]That didn't seem like a dangerous game.
[222:50.86]You really do need more conflict.
[222:52.75]No, I think that granny game needs a lot of conflict.
[222:57.15]I don't know.
[222:58.76]I'm into the granny game.
[223:00.37]I think it might be cool.
[223:01.11]It might be fun.
[223:01.60]I don't know.
[223:03.61]Hey, maybe it'll be on your top 250.
[223:10.09]Yeah, so I want to explain that to my chat and I know you explain it because maybe your chat hasn't heard it either.
[223:15.77]They definitely have, but you want me to give you the little rundown?
[223:20.82]Yeah.
[223:21.65]Okay, here's what's going on.
[223:25.08]I've talked about this before.
[223:26.21]I want other people to do it, but it's got to happen first.
[223:30.16]I, and I asked her if he wanted to do it too.
[223:33.53]I asked Holly to do it.
[223:34.74]I just kind of getting a temperature check from a lot of people.
[223:37.70]Remember I talked about that your favorite everything ever made?
[223:43.03]I have compiled the top 250 most important, most impactful, best video games I've ever played in my life.
[223:52.63]Took me like a week or two to do it.
[223:55.40]It's every, through every era, every console, and they're all going to go up against each other.
[224:01.85]Because, and the reason why I want to do this is, this is part two here.
[224:06.55]When you ask somebody what their favorite game of all time is, everybody can usually do their top 10.
[224:11.50]Oh, yeah, what's your top five?
[224:12.70]What's your top 10?
[224:13.37]What's your top 15?
[224:14.89]Everybody's like, oh, yeah, of course I can do that.
[224:16.54]Well, this one, this one, this one, this one.
[224:18.04]It's like everybody knows that, right?
[224:20.70]But I want to know what everybody's like 11 through 50 is.
[224:25.46]I think that the 11 through 50 is almost more interesting to me than top 10.
[224:29.66]Because why is that?
[224:31.83]Why is 12 where 12 is?
[224:35.24]And how I wanna do this is I'm gonna have a little website built where you will do like eliminations.
[224:43.44]So you have to kind of go through two or three rounds of eliminating and then doing like a tier list-esque thing.
[224:50.36]It's going to be an upgraded watch mojo.
[224:54.04]It seemed like a fun thing to do.
[224:57.16]And I was like, hey, Ster.
[224:59.36]Do you want to like come up with the top 250 things that you've ever done?
[225:02.92]And I know that we've talked about like.
[225:04.35]The top 200 things in your entire life, which we've laughed about before of
[225:09.82]Hey, where does macaroni and cheese taking a bite for the first time when you were 12 go against getting an A plus on that paper in college that year?
[225:18.10]versus uh like uh obscure expedition 33. right I mean
[225:25.38]Where's the logical journey of the Zumbinis?
[225:27.33]That's up there.
[225:28.15]It's somewhere.
[225:29.31]But the point of this is I don't care about the what they are.
[225:32.35]I care about the why.
[225:34.41]And Ster last night was talking about, Hey, I don't know if I've even, I think I know, I think I could do it and Ster.
[225:41.89]How many did you come up with?
[225:44.11]Oh, in a day or two?
[225:45.54]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[225:48.76]100%.
[225:52.93]I literally just sat back down.
[225:54.34]I had an emergency level bathroom.
[226:01.73]Are you alright?
[226:03.71]Yeah.
[226:04.58]I was...
[226:05.82]I tell you, the last two trailers I was squirming.
[226:11.83]Put that on your two 50.
[226:14.63]Okay.
[226:15.48]So how it's okay.
[226:18.78]So I, I w was I not, was I muted on your stream?
[226:21.35]Did everybody hear what I was?
[226:21.99]Oh, no, no, they heard.
[226:23.18]Yeah, no, he roped me in and I started writing them down.
[226:27.31]He went he like he went to the bathroom in this scenario and I I started writing down just from my steam list It was already like a hundred games and I was like, you know what?
[226:35.75]there's something to this and it's what here's why it's interesting because it's not what is the best game of all time who give I don't care about that right
[226:45.13]What I want to see and what I want to know is impact, importance.
[226:50.16]Like, is...
[226:51.83]If you put how, where you were in your life, how much you went back to this thing, how much do you still think about this thing?
[226:58.79]Did this shape you?
[227:00.40]Did this change you?
[227:01.70]It's important, think about it as an interesting experiment.
[227:05.40]I wanted to put things that weren't games on the list, but then he yelled at me.
[227:09.20]Well, no, because before you sat down, we already talked about that.
[227:12.10]how there's like they could you put music and television shows and movie the problem with doing that is
[227:17.50]That shit would be like a thousand things long and it'd be hard to like curate them.
[227:22.62]Week-long marathon.
[227:24.36]It would take a long time.
[227:25.31]I just I like the idea of Binding of Isaac versus like McDonald's burgers and fries.
[227:30.32]Yeah.
[227:30.86]Which one was more impactful?
[227:32.95]Yeah, like the mowing the lawn for the first time and having your dad stand in the background being like,
[227:39.30]Perfect, perfect wines.
[227:41.54]versus like the cranberry sauce coming out of the can in one .
[227:48.42]Like that's .
[227:50.15]That's up there.
[227:52.74]Okay.
[227:53.45]That versus Binding of Isaac's repentance.
[227:58.72]But anyways, this is something that I want to do over the next few weeks to next month.
[228:03.48]I want to get this thing all made.
[228:04.75]And...
[228:07.18]The list is crazy.
[228:09.31]And it's funny because it's almost like, this is where it gets really deep and fucking crazy.
[228:15.07]Ster, you mentioned this last night when I talked to you about it, but if you looked at all the, and I took, I took a long time doing this.
[228:21.96]What games did I love?
[228:23.89]Did I like?
[228:24.91]That a huge impact?
[228:26.26]That kind of shaped the dude that I am, at least as like the art form of video games.
[228:30.61]That's like the recipe of you up there if you played all two fucking hundred and fifty of these games
[228:39.42]That's how you get this guy.
[228:41.43]Okay.
[228:42.34]It's the fucking recipe and everybody's got a different recipe.
[228:45.47]And that's interesting to me.
[228:46.39]And I like it.
[228:46.83]And you got long nails.
[228:47.84]I don't give a fuck.
[228:49.14]Okay, I gotta cut.
[228:50.59]He really does.
[228:51.48]What's up with that?
[228:53.32]I'm a full of fucking calcium, dude.
[228:55.29]My bones are strong as, stronger than anybody else.
[229:00.45]Everybody has a different recipe.
[229:01.23]It's striking.
[229:02.92]So I wanna know the recipe, and again,
[229:05.48]Team Fortress 2, Diablo II, that's fine, that's fine.
[229:08.92]I care about that 11.
[229:10.73]to 70.
[229:13.58]Why?
[229:14.94]Why is that number 11 and not number 10?
[229:18.75]And what is it against?
[229:21.66]You get it?
[229:23.25]I get it, dude.
[229:24.01]I freaking get it.
[229:27.22]Oh, multiple rounds?
[229:30.22]It's going to be fun.
[229:31.52]It's to find out who the fuck you are.
[229:32.71]I was going to ask you, what happens if...
[229:34.49]This was supposed to be a versus thing.
[229:36.22]What happens if it is something...
[229:38.67]You know, you like running your top two is like too early in the list.
[229:43.72]Oh, that's already thought of, that'll be thought of.
[229:45.42]How I think it's gonna work out is you will, because the first round that you're gonna go through
[229:51.77]is let's say you have however many you have right if you have 200 or 250 the idea is that you have to eliminate like 50 right off the bat
[229:57.96]So only like, only like 150 games that you got to get rid of.
[230:02.12]They cannot move on.
[230:02.84]You need to make the decision.
[230:03.85]It's not like, oh, that one.
[230:04.71]Nope.
[230:05.05]You have to remove them.
[230:05.96]You have to shrink the list in that first round, then
[230:11.51]During that period, you'll be putting one to three stars
[230:16.51]on the games and this does not mean one is bad three is great these are michelin stars I'm saying these are michelin starred restaurants that you're talking about
[230:24.74]So however many one-star games you have, two-star games you have, three-star games you have, then you can start to kind of fill it out that way.
[230:33.35]So it'll end up working out correctly.
[230:37.15]Yes.
[230:38.81]Well, Jerma, I had a pleasant time with you, as always.
[230:43.92]Yeah.
[230:44.04]But I'm being told there's new PoE 2 info, and I have to...
[230:48.10]do that okay well it was fun thanks for hanging out and we'll see you later say everybody say bye
[230:55.06]I'll see y'all in a few days when me and Jerma play the greatest game ever.
[231:00.16]Hey, everybody.
[231:02.79]Hey.
[231:04.00]Alright, say what I did.
[231:06.96]So yeah, that has been something I've been wanting to do for a while.
[231:11.26]And I've been slowly punching at it because as I've gone through, and it's actually kind of cool to see.
[231:17.29]Cause I have a kind of color coded where it's like, here's NES, here's the SNES, here's the Dreamcast.
[231:22.77]And which, what had the most?
[231:25.34]And having to look at, like, oh yeah, of course Chrono Trigger's on there.
[231:30.23]But so is Captain America and the Avengers for the SNES.
[231:33.62]Do you know how high up on the list the point blank for the arcade is?
[231:38.85]Do you know how high that probably has to be?
[231:40.76]It has to be.
[231:43.23]That has to be high.
[231:51.08]This is very Virgo of you.
[231:55.14]You chronically underrate Elden Ring after finishing it.
[232:03.09]What?
[232:03.63]Elden Ring is like, I think Elden Ring is probably going to be in the top 10.
[232:10.85]Ster also said this too.
[232:12.10]He's like, oh, so you want to do all this stuff to find it?
[232:14.79]He's like, I know who I am.
[232:17.18]He's like, you don't know who the fuck you are.
[232:19.22]You have to do this.
[232:20.00]And he's like, I know who I am.
[232:23.41]And then he comes back to me the next day and he's got a hundred games on his list so far.
[232:27.94]He's got a hundred on his list and he's like, oh shit, actually, I don't know.
[232:35.66]He thought he knew who he was until he went down the Super Nintendo list and said, wait a minute, when I was 13,
[232:44.77]I played that every day.
[232:46.10]And it might be more important than some of these other fucking games.
[232:50.68]Even the ones that I think I like more.
[232:52.13]You get it?
[232:54.96]Crack number 50.
[232:57.34]I gotta get my eyes fucking... Well, actually, I did get my eyes checked.
[233:00.71]It's a whole nother fucking story for a different day.
[233:04.87]I would need another 10 years.
[233:12.66]I never even heard of Claire.
[233:14.51]I mean, that's the thing.
[233:15.66]I don't think anybody did until everybody did.
[233:26.69]I look extra French today.
[233:28.27]I don't think so.
[233:33.64]Also, what might be kind of cool too is this was funny because we got this most important, best, most impactful.
[233:40.94]What is that fucking top 250?
[233:42.57]What is that top?
[233:43.41]200 what about the worst experiences you've ever had what about the worst games of your whole life it might be fun to do the evil version
[233:59.93]Do the positive version, then do the negative version.
[234:03.45]And what is the worst fucking thing you've ever played?
[234:07.73]Maybe it was like such an awful thing that you just, you know what I mean?
[234:11.48]But what is the worst fucking game of all time?
[234:19.37]But then those have to go against each other too.
[234:22.39]So if you really think that this game is worse than this game, you need to figure that out.
[234:29.74]People like to watch tier lists.
[234:31.91]And I don't think it's because of the what, it's because of the why.
[234:35.04]Right?
[234:35.38]It's not what it is, it's why did you put it there.
[234:38.13]This is just a gigantic why did you do that list.
[234:41.71]So we'll see, should be fun.
[234:45.76]And I.
[234:47.26]am leaving.
[234:48.79]I know all you Wuthering Rooms fans are going to be very upset to hear that.
[234:55.60]Because I did say I thought about maybe continuing for like a few hours after.
[234:58.88]That's not the case.
[235:03.50]I will be back on Sunday.
[235:06.33]We're going to play a couple of games on Sunday.
[235:07.87]We'll do withering rooms and a mystery game.
[235:14.80]And I think Monday we're going to do a sponsor with Ster and then we'll take it from there.
[235:27.44]It is withering.
[235:28.55]Oh, I'll play us out with this today.
[235:31.53]Cause why not?
[235:32.84]Hold on.
[235:33.16]Give me a sec.
[235:39.26]I'm gonna play my favorite song from the Look Outside OST.
[235:50.78]I love it.
[235:53.80]I will see you guys later.
[235:54.77]Have a great rest of your night.
[235:55.65]Game Awards were crazy.
[235:57.02]No Half-Life 3.
[235:59.98]But I mean, at this point, just whatever.
[236:03.71]If it ever comes out, it comes out.
[236:04.89]Valve has done so many things in this industry.
[236:07.36]It's fine.
[236:08.91]We don't need it.
[236:10.03]They can make it whenever they're ready.
[236:16.89]And I
[236:21.58]I'll see you later.
[236:24.77]Start it over.
[238:34.37]I listened to that whole thing.
[238:35.74]I was just, I was just sitting here vibing out.
[238:37.87]That's like top, there's other great, that's not even, there's so many other good songs in that game.
[238:43.51]Go listen to the whole, no, go play the game.
[238:45.75]Game of the year.
[238:46.23]Look outside.
[238:47.04]There it was.
[238:49.52]You're going to love it.
[238:51.35]It's interesting.
[238:51.95]It's weird.
[238:52.60]It's fun.
[238:53.10]It's engaging.
[238:54.57]It's a story.
[238:55.85]You don't know what the fuck's going to happen next.
[238:57.32]You don't know who you're gonna run into.
[238:58.46]You don't know who you're gonna meet.
[238:59.28]The songs all hit so hard.
[239:01.81]It's so fun.
[239:02.55]There's so many things to go back and look at.
[239:03.96]There's so many things to see.
[239:04.90]There's so many things that the dev has added
[239:07.31]go look outside.
[239:10.13]Go get it.
[239:14.62]Maybe that song is Terminal.
[239:16.73]And that's like, that's like, there's so many more.
[239:20.86]See you later.
[239:21.95]Goodbye.
[239:24.10]Call your mother, please.
