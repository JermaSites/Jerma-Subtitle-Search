[00:58.78]Wait, what?
[01:10.27]Wait, what?
[01:56.72]Wait...
[01:57.57]WHAT?! !
[02:30.46]Hi.
[02:33.38]How's everybody doing?
[02:35.06]I'm okay.
[02:36.08]Hope you're doing good, too.
[02:39.38]We got that ukulele tonight.
[02:42.90]I'm currently surrounded by snakes.
[02:48.68]The mic is muted?
[02:49.44]I was just giving it a second.
[02:52.36]Get the stream going.
[02:53.04]Make sure people can come in.
[02:53.92]Trickle in.
[02:54.66]Ukulele.
[02:58.82]Good to see you.
[03:01.13]Make sure Yooka-Laylee's camera doesn't make you vomit.
[03:03.53]Really.
[03:04.27]Oh boy.
[03:07.31]So the reason why we started like 25 minutes late, if you don't know, if you didn't see my tweet, it was just, there was a snake in here.
[03:15.74]Oh, I can hear it.
[03:17.74]I'm not even kidding.
[03:18.30]I can fucking hear it.
[03:18.86]I swear to God.
[03:19.38]I just heard it.
[03:20.66]Where is it?
[03:23.33]Am I going, am I going fucking crazy?
[03:25.33]I just heard like slithering noises.
[03:26.79]I'm not kidding.
[03:27.93]Hold on.
[03:29.59]I'm in my underwear, I can't even turn the camera on.
[03:31.95]I gotta stand up for a second.
[03:36.30]Where is it?
[03:39.14]I swear to god I heard the like, it dragging across the carpet.
[03:44.34]Fuck, this stream is gonna be a disaster.
[03:47.71]I'm going to hear the smallest little noise.
[03:49.72]It was in the... Okay, long story short, it got in the wall, okay?
[03:53.38]I tried to scoop it up and get it out of here, because I don't want to hurt the snake.
[03:57.26]It's a snake friend.
[03:58.08]It's a little, like, 14, 15-inch garden snake.
[04:00.64]It's not scary.
[04:02.32]But when I went to go do that, it freaked out and, like, slithered away, and it got into the fucking wall.
[04:06.64]It's inside my wall somewhere.
[04:08.92]Wait, what?
[04:11.06]I fucking swear to God I heard it.
[04:12.50]It's kind of like... Okay, I just, like, look, okay.
[04:16.08]I...
[04:19.54]I'm naked right now, but I'm serious.
[04:23.22]Look at this.
[04:23.56]Look at all these potential snakes.
[04:24.84]I'm going to turn on my webcam.
[04:27.94]I'm not kidding.
[04:28.54]I keep looking at this shit.
[04:29.34]I can't show myself because I'm fucking naked.
[04:31.77]But like, look at all these snakes that are in my room.
[04:34.89]Look at this.
[04:40.43]Like, I look over here.
[04:44.56]Is it even plugged in?
[04:46.52]No, my webcam's not even plugged in.
[04:48.02]Hold on a second, you gotta see this.
[04:49.46]Give me one second.
[04:51.69]Maybe I can just do this for the time being.
[04:53.67]I gotta plug this in, because this is important.
[04:55.31]I need to show you all the cords that are on the ground, that are black.
[05:05.54]It was a little black snake.
[05:08.40]And motherfuckers, I keep looking over here.
[05:12.99]And like, take a look at that, take a look at that snake.
[05:15.93]I looked, that was a snake.
[05:17.11]Oh, what's that?
[05:17.57]There's a snake right there, too.
[05:19.65]What's right here?
[05:20.79]Another couple snakes.
[05:22.85]Every chord is a snake in this room.
[05:24.41]Every single one.
[05:26.55]I don't know what to do.
[05:27.85]Like, is that him, or is that a chord in the back there?
[05:30.33]That's a snake.
[05:31.85]No, that's just a chord.
[05:34.59]Ugh.
[05:36.15]Fuck me.
[05:43.55]Alright, let's... This is not going to go well.
[05:47.58]What's that between my legs?
[05:48.74]Another snake.
[05:51.30]How big is it?
[05:51.86]I'm not afraid of snakes, but I just don't like to be... Guys.
[05:57.48]I'm... Let's get this over with.
[06:00.08]I'm not afraid of snakes.
[06:01.93]I just don't like to be surprised by a snake.
[06:07.53]And how come this is not capturing?
[06:11.60]Hey, ukulele, what's going on here?
[06:13.36]Alright, well.
[06:17.67]Let's get that going again.
[06:18.71]Let's try this.
[06:22.87]Ukulele.
[06:24.01]Ukulele.
[06:24.51]There it is, right?
[06:28.32]Uh-huh.
[06:30.60]No.
[06:32.82]Yeah.
[06:34.90]Well.
[06:36.46]I don't think game capture works, so give me one second while we just cap the fucking game.
[06:43.12]Hopefully this works.
[06:46.06]What are we going to do?
[06:46.54]You're going to see my monitor again.
[06:47.90]That's fine.
[06:52.22]That's fine.
[06:52.84]Who cares?
[06:53.30]Okay.
[06:54.62]That worked.
[06:58.48]So if you guys don't know That's a pretty fucking low and still up, okay This is pretty much just banjo-kazooie before I
[07:26.27]Wait, how many Banjo-Kazooies were there?
[07:29.23]There's Banjo-Kazooie 1, there's a snake, where?
[07:32.05]Oh, that is a snake.
[07:34.11]Okay, I just looked at my Twitter, and I saw the snake picture I put up, and it freaked me out.
[07:38.13]God damn it, this is going to be a disaster, I can already tell.
[07:40.91]It's going to show itself halfway through the stream, and I'm going to scream like a little girl.
[07:46.99]Hold on.
[07:47.35]I'm going to right now streaming.
[07:54.11]Yooka.
[07:56.84]Laylee.
[07:57.44]How do you even say this game?
[08:01.53]Is it Yooka Laylee?
[08:02.59]It's right there.
[08:03.05]Okay, Yooka Laylee.
[08:06.63]This was supposed to be a chill stream, by the way.
[08:10.15]Where I don't get high strung.
[08:11.36]I don't, like, get high energy.
[08:13.58]I just chill and play Yooka Laylee.
[08:15.38]That's what this was supposed to be.
[08:18.00]And now it's turned into a fucking snake stream.
[08:22.70]Would it mean the snake is real?
[08:23.82]Of course it is!
[08:24.86]I wouldn't be freaking out this much if there wasn't a fucking snake in the room.
[08:28.60]Buried in my wall somewhere.
[08:29.86]Oh, I can't even put my feet down on the ground.
[08:32.73]I have to, like, sit like this.
[08:34.15]Okay.
[08:37.63]Let's go.
[08:38.95]So this is, like, by the same people that made the original Banjo-Kazooie, right?
[08:42.15]From my understanding.
[08:45.61]Alright.
[08:46.37]There's, like, a little arcade main adventure.
[08:48.11]Let's just get started.
[08:50.45]That's not a fake snake!
[08:51.93]Go look at my Twitter!
[08:53.35]That's a real snake!
[08:54.48]Just pick it up!
[08:55.10]No!
[08:55.36]I don't want to hurt Mr. Snake!
[08:59.18]New game.
[08:59.66]That looks about right.
[09:04.92]There's like multiple safes.
[09:06.00]Whoa!
[09:06.60]Okay, that's cool.
[09:09.37]New game, let's go.
[09:10.25]Alright, here comes the cutscene.
[09:11.05]Everybody, please be quiet.
[09:14.54]Oh my fucking god, I just dumped my drink on the ground.
[09:17.12]God, fuck me, man.
[09:18.32]Like, come on.
[09:21.05]Why did I think that was... I just dumped my fucking drink on the ground.
[09:26.09]Well, how?
[09:27.25]Why did I do that?
[09:28.07]That doesn't make any sense.
[09:31.49]How do I dump a fucking drink on the ground?
[09:35.79]Now that carpet's ruined, this is fucking great.
[09:39.67]Wait, what?
[09:44.18]I can't wait for them to go.
[09:45.06]Yeah yeah yep yeah yep yeah yeah yep.
[09:53.84]See?
[10:15.96]This is just the guy from Despicable Me.
[10:25.85]Okay.
[10:27.07]Okay.
[10:47.98]The boss says fucking Donald Duck Daffy Duck That sounds like Marge Simpson That's Marge Simpson That's-
[11:16.37]It's Marge Simpson, like, clearing her throat.
[11:22.47]It's the Randy Savage breathing montage.
[11:30.87]That's my favorite.
[11:31.85]The Randy Savage breathing montage.
[11:33.85]I can't fucking see.
[11:46.80]They're just gonna crawl on me.
[11:49.16]Okay, I promise you guys.
[11:50.20]If, like, I notice the snake is on me, if the snake gets on my body, I don't care if I'm turning on the fucking camera, I'm in my underwear, I'll get banned.
[11:58.21]That, like, needs to be documented.
[11:59.25]Actually, no, that's a bad idea.
[12:06.10]Just, like, a naked guy with, like, a snake on him, screaming.
[12:11.18]Why do I think that's fucking funny?
[12:14.70]I'm just like, I'm gonna turn it on!
[12:15.75]And he's like screaming, get it off me!
[12:18.03]And then I get like perma-banded, like my career ends.
[12:23.55]Oh look, that's us.
[12:32.76]What's the bat sound like?
[12:33.94]Okay, the bat's gonna be like... Aww.
[12:43.97]Great way to get banned.
[12:54.19]I would want to be one of these voices.
[12:55.31]It would be so much fun.
[12:56.41]Twitch career.
[12:57.46]Career.
[12:58.10]It would be an amazing end to your long line career.
[13:07.20]The bat sounds like a monkey.
[13:16.43]Owen Wilson wizard.
[13:17.73]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[13:20.39]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, you're fantastic.

[13:52.90]Quick, after it.
[13:53.46]It's worth it.
[13:53.88]Okay, we're gonna... We're gonna go track down the books, right?
[13:58.84]So we're gonna go this way.
[14:00.08]Here's that original nostalgia music, right?
[14:06.09]There's a snake.
[14:07.49]There he is.
[14:07.93]This is Laylee.
[14:09.26]Do we know you?
[14:10.36]I just heard the rattle and I'm like looking behind me.

[17:13.72]It's a double jump.
[17:17.87]Here's another chest.
[17:18.99]What do you want?

[17:54.09]Did I name the snake?
[17:54.85]We did not name the snake yet.
[17:56.47]That is true.
[17:56.93]Can I not go up there?
[18:00.76]I guess not.
[18:02.38]I need, like, the super run.
[18:05.15]Four.
[18:05.47]And here's five.
[18:08.79]They made this game in Unity.
[18:12.21]That's actually fairly impressive.
[18:18.71]Barry?
[18:19.99]No, not Barry.
[18:24.77]Barry the snake?
[18:25.45]That's not a good snake name.
[18:26.41]It's got to be like Sammy.
[18:27.67]It's got to have an S name.
[18:31.38]Sassy the snake.
[18:34.55]Darren, the snake.
[18:35.21]No, Darren's like the crocodile monster alien thing.
[18:37.68]Come on then, Lipsy.
[18:41.42]Spill the beans.
[18:42.08]Where's our book?
[18:43.30]Your book headed toward the businesses beyond this gate.
[18:47.58]Strange things going on in there since the takeover by Hivory Powers Corporation.
[18:56.44]I'm headed there myself to sell some moves.
[18:58.66]Allow me to raise the gate.
[19:00.86]Sure.
[19:03.13]Solidus snake.
[19:06.08]Alright, let's go.
[19:08.09]Holy shit.
[19:10.73]DieLoveDonuts just gave another $100.
[19:12.69]DieLoveDonuts has given $300 in five minutes.
[19:18.80]Dude.
[19:20.22]Dude, he just says, no message, just shut up and take my money.
[19:24.70]Alright, okay.
[19:26.84]Will do.
[19:27.28]I will shut up and take your money.
[19:30.29]If you are so inclined to let me have it.
[19:33.60]Thank you for the 300 fucking dollars.
[19:36.09]That's all I can say.
[19:37.11]You're very, very generous.
[19:42.57]Get across this.
[19:43.11]Jump, yeah.
[19:43.97]There's a double jump.
[19:45.97]I already know that.
[19:48.07]And then also, StyxRenegade gave another 10 bucks.
[19:50.72]It's Styx the snake.
[19:51.72]That's actually not a bad one.
[19:52.68]That's pretty good.
[19:53.16]Big crutch.
[19:55.76]Left trigger.
[19:59.31]Okay, let's get a little crouch.
[20:02.06]A tutorial classic, we'd best stay-
[28:05.75]I have no idea.
[28:06.47]I'm too overwhelmed to know.
[28:08.77]I don't know.
[28:15.55]Okay, so this is how you open up new worlds.
[28:16.99]You just need a certain amount of pieces.
[28:18.21]Okay.
[28:21.13]So what?
[28:21.85]The consensus on this game is that it sucks?
[28:24.58]Is that what people are saying?
[28:31.10]Why does it suck?
[28:32.18]I mean, there's been no indication so far that it's gonna suck.
[28:36.52]I don't know.
[28:42.00]You two chaps need to explore those grand homes, and I'm looking to expand my business to new locations.
[28:47.12]How about we make a deal?
[28:49.74]For every grand tome you unlock, I'll help your quest with a new move free of charge.
[28:55.10]Sounds like a good deal.
[28:55.80]Okay.
[28:57.13]Super, your first complimentary move is on one of my trademark abilities.
[29:00.45]If you hold down RT, you'll get the grip you need to roll up slippery ramps.
[29:06.89]Okay, there was a slippery ramp outside.
[29:10.01]One note in the small print.
[29:11.27]The longer you use this move, the more you'll drain your power bar.
[29:13.67]Okay.
[29:14.23]Okay.
[29:15.72]Okay.
[29:21.96]That's how I do it.
[29:24.12]Sir Jimmy Jammer again, 50 bucks.
[29:26.02]Am I breaking expectations yet?
[29:27.69]Play more Spore.
[29:28.81]No, never.
[29:31.17]No, we ain't playing Spore ever again.
[29:33.97]But thank you so much for the $50.
[29:37.03]But we ain't ever playing that again.
[29:41.34]I was begged to play Spore for like two weeks straight, and we did it, and it was a catastrophe.
[29:47.14]It was a catastrophe.
[29:53.19]This really is a money stream right now.
[29:55.03]We were making that joke earlier, but now it is Did somebody just do a fucking hundred dollar Jupiter?
[30:10.66]Somebody just spent a hundred dollars on a Jupiter mostly lost gave a hundred bucks to do Jarva Jupiter Are you fucking serious guys?
[30:22.42]Thank you, Mostly Lost, for your $100, Jupiter.
[30:27.43]Dude, eventually I'm gonna have to make, like, Jupiter a, like, the custom, like, a... I would watch you try and make a house of cards.
[30:39.85]I love donuts.
[30:40.73]50 bucks.
[30:41.03]This is getting, this is getting too much.
[30:43.06]This is getting... Uh... We haven't even collected the first puzzle piece yet.
[30:51.51]But thank you so much.
[30:53.06]Oh my fucking god.
[30:54.50]Oh my god, no.
[31:01.73]Lucky strike.
[31:03.73]No, no.
[31:05.23]No money strike.
[31:06.23]It is a money.
[31:06.79]I can't say it's not a money stream now.
[31:09.09]It just is.
[31:10.22]It's just a money stream.
[31:11.18]That's what it turned into.
[31:14.37]This stream has turned into a, a, like, I have a vacuum cleaner, and you guys are all there throwing money into the air, and I'm just, like, fucking reverse proton pack, like, what?
[31:31.21]Thank you.
[31:32.51]So much, everybody.
[31:34.15]Thank you.
[31:35.01]Lucky Strike, thank you.
[31:36.13]Did somebody say Money Streamer?
[31:37.69]Yeah, I just did.
[31:38.59]And I... That's not something that... I will never, like, encourage this.
[31:42.73]But... Sometimes it's just... I just don't know what to say.
[31:48.46]And then Sticks came in with $100,000.
[31:49.36]No, not $1,000.
[31:49.60]It's $10.
[31:51.06]Oh, A-E-I-O-U.
[31:51.46]Where's the Y?
[31:51.80]Sometimes Y.
[31:59.80]A, E... Oh, that's... Those are not the correct vowels.
[32:04.15]I won't give so much money next stream, I promise.
[32:09.25]I can money stream too, guys, says MatterOfDarkness.
[32:13.68]With the dollar, thank you.
[32:18.69]I wasn't even paying attention to what that guy was even saying.
[32:25.23]Alright, I'm honest.
[32:26.05]I'm dry.
[32:26.91]I love donuts.
[32:28.05]You're alright.
[32:29.63]You don't have to... Okay, you know in the Monopoly, when you go to jail in Monopoly, and the Monopoly man has both his pockets emptied, and he's like behind bars, and he's like, oh no!
[32:40.07]I don't want you to get like that.
[32:41.93]I don't want you to be like that.
[32:43.91]But thank you.
[32:44.37]Uh, alright.
[32:48.63]This used to be a Dr. Pepper stream.
[32:50.36]It says, gas station soda, 99 cents.
[32:52.68]Well, thank you, gas station soda.
[32:55.78]This used to be a Dr. Pepper stream.
[32:57.48]That's not a 99 cent soda.
[32:58.66]That's like a dollar 25.
[33:05.15]Dr. Pepper's on the carpet?
[33:06.02]No, this, like, this naked blue machine juice I'm drinking.
[33:11.26]I would rather spill a Dr. Pepper on this carpet, not a, like, naked juice smoothie.
[33:17.90]Alright, so, has anybody get any of this?
[33:19.85]I have not been able to pay attention.
[33:22.35]This used to be a video game stream.
[33:25.57]It will be a video game stream.
[33:28.52]Hey, Mr. Tasty Cake, thank you for the 30 bits, the 30 cents.
[33:31.60]I only have this much.
[33:32.44]That's fine.
[33:33.04]Don't worry.
[33:34.34]Don't worry about a thing.
[33:37.29]I don't remember what to do here.
[33:38.21]Oh, okay, yeah.
[33:41.19]It'll be one page.
[33:42.03]Yes.
[33:45.13]And then Ski.
[33:45.95]Thank you, Ski, for the five dollars.
[33:46.83]They say hi, hi.
[33:47.71]And then Red Chris with five dollars.
[33:48.88]How many more bits until Donuts is mod?
[33:50.54]That you can't buy mod.
[33:56.88]Let's go to the grand... Let's go to the grand casino.
[34:03.28]First book.
[34:08.36]Some moves and abilities will drain your power bar.
[34:09.90]Yes, I am aware.
[34:14.88]No, I got a loading screen.
[34:15.75]Let me look around my room.
[34:17.15]I just got, like, chills.
[34:21.41]Tribal Stack Tropics.
[34:26.55]Didn't never trust a purple.
[34:27.89]Buy mod?
[34:28.53]No.
[34:30.67]There are mods that aren't even subbed.
[34:32.98]But I know that they are around and do good work.
[34:35.68]Yeah, feather.
[34:37.12]Secret.
[34:38.12]Okay, eight.
[34:40.64]I guess we're just going to walk around.
[34:49.20]That's an interesting person.
[34:50.36]No?
[34:52.85]Ghost Riders Are We, this book we made.
[34:56.25]Free all five and a treasure wheel trade.
[34:58.39]Okay.
[34:59.71]So those are the new, uh... What were they called again?
[35:02.09]The... What were the... The Jinkos?
[35:06.61]What were the things in Banjo-Kazooie?
[35:12.16]Jinkos was like a line of clothes.
[35:13.40]What were they called?
[35:14.56]Jingles?
[35:19.14]Oh, yeah.
[35:19.64]Jinjo.
[35:20.18]Jinjo!
[35:22.48]Alright, well, let's go.
[35:24.32]Let's go straight up the front door.
[35:27.50]Alright, I just learned my new ability.
[35:32.80]It's very pretty.
[35:33.77]I like it.
[35:35.35]Okay.
[35:36.75]Hmm, what do you say?
[35:42.95]We're gonna go up.
[35:44.11]There's another one of those ghost riders.
[35:47.79]So, some of these guys are gonna be... Where's, like, the Kickstarter people?
[35:50.23]Oh.
[35:51.94]Are we gonna get to see those Kickstarter donators?
[35:53.80]Like, is this like... Is this like Gary Arthur Stevenson?
[35:57.47]Did he give like $5,000?
[35:58.05]Let's see.
[35:59.05]What does he want?
[36:05.37]He wants me to feed him.
[36:06.25]Feed you what?
[36:09.09]Snake check?
[36:10.67]No snake.
[36:12.23]I know exactly where he went in, but I don't know where he's gonna come out.
[36:17.91]Nope, no snake.
[36:19.13]Snake check complete.
[36:22.25]This used to be a rich boy stream.
[36:24.73]Hey, well, thank you!
[36:25.79]To, by the way, speaking of money, uh... Squeesant... ...gave five bucks.
[36:31.59]Do you know of any other games that are like Sorcery?
[36:33.54]Those accents you did with Comedy Gold.
[36:35.40]Um... Well, Sorcery... ...is Steve Jackson.
[36:40.16]And, uh, Ian... Ian Livingston?
[36:44.30]So, if I were you, Steve Jackson wrote a lot of books.
[36:47.12]It's just some of them weren't translated to digital.
[36:50.72]But there's a lot of books.
[36:52.56]If you're so inclined to check out more Steve Jackson, check out his whole fighting fantasy series.
[36:58.06]Fighting fantasy.
[37:01.26]They look like a racy pair.
[37:03.04]Oh, this is Layla.
[37:05.93]Okay.
[37:07.95]I'm nimble, and I like the look of you two.
[37:09.57]I must say, how about we see who is most racy, you know, in a race?
[37:12.95]Around my course.
[37:15.35]Mm-hmm.
[37:18.31]Alright, let's make sure.
[37:19.47]A race?
[37:24.05]God-based racing.
[37:25.01]Next gen.
[37:28.49]Adopt the snake.
[37:29.37]Oh, I was thinking about it at this point.
[37:31.67]Alright, here we go.
[37:35.64]Here we go.
[37:35.98]Strap yourself in one lap first through all the... Oh, so I have to beat him in a race.
[37:38.78]Go.
[37:42.54]Why you some...
[37:47.21]Okay, I like... I didn't know I could do this for this long, and I can catch up to him.
[37:52.47]Although I'm kind of running out.
[37:57.92]I need to collect those butterflies, like, right now.
[38:00.52]I didn't get any of them.
[38:01.52]Alright.
[38:03.30]Well, don't think I'm gonna do that.
[38:04.98]I don't think I'm gonna win this time.
[38:08.46]Okay, so he wins.
[38:14.67]Maybe he'll fuck up.
[38:22.51]Yeah, well, how was I supposed to know I needed to do that?
[38:27.01]What's the range on being able to pick these up?
[38:30.05]Do you have to, like, run directly into them?
[38:32.03]That's not cool.
[38:36.48]Well, I lose.
[38:40.42]Alright, let's do it again.
[38:47.66]Come on.
[38:48.36]You need the Yoshi's Island.
[38:55.71]I'm gonna find the snake in my couch.
[38:57.39]I know.
[38:58.09]It's gonna be such a pain in the ass.
[39:02.83]I'm gonna wake up with that snake in my bed.
[39:09.91]I missed those.
[39:14.43]I'm far enough ahead of him, though, where I did... I don't like that.
[39:18.81]I don't like that.
[39:24.15]I don't like that feature.
[39:28.78]I like that feature.
[39:32.16]Like, how did I not run into the other one?
[39:33.40]Do I need to go up on the bridge for this one?
[39:40.58]I mean, yeah, but I didn't even get it.
[39:43.62]And I lost again.
[39:49.02]He's gonna win.
[39:49.92]It's over again.
[39:52.52]I gotta, like, really cut this corner like fucking NASCAR.
[39:58.46]Come on!
[39:59.90]This is fucking stupid!
[40:07.07]Let's go!
[40:07.99]Go again!
[40:09.63]People are giving me money.
[40:17.30]Hold on a second.
[40:18.38]I need to beat this stupid fucking race.
[40:24.62]With the jokey, finicky turns.
[40:31.58]This shit is, like, so easy.
[40:32.82]These, like, dumbass butterflies, like, fly around in, like, a stupid pattern.
[40:39.99]Games... No.
[40:42.85]No, I'm kidding.
[40:48.63]Like, what the fuck was that?
[40:49.96]Why did it not get collected?
[40:52.30]What the fuck?
[40:54.92]No, you gotta be shitting me.
[40:56.12]Like, why did I... Like, honest... Okay.
[41:00.10]Now I'm actually mad at this game.
[41:02.55]That was like a joke before, and now I'm actually angry with this game.
[41:05.59]It's been 30 minutes and I'm already mad.
[41:08.26]Like, what in the flying fuck was that?
[41:09.82]And now I'm not gonna win.
[41:16.49]It's gonna be like a fucking Christmas miracle if I can beat him, Ryder.
[41:20.53]No.
[41:20.97]What the fuck?
[41:28.19]What the fuck?
[41:31.07]Like... Why is this even possible to lose like this?
[41:40.96]Hold on.
[41:42.02]Like... Really?
[41:47.10]I just like glitch collected all three of those.
[41:48.90]I'm being beaten by a cloud right now.
[41:56.64]I swear to God, if I go through these guys, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[42:00.40]I got two of them.
[42:01.22]Okay.
[42:05.96]Don't have that happen again.
[42:07.18]It happens right here.
[42:09.40]I got one.
[42:10.06]Okay.
[42:13.06]Do I seriously have to get one of these up here?
[42:15.02]Probably.
[42:20.04]God.
[42:20.36]I think I'm okay still.
[42:26.70]No, I'm gonna win.
[42:28.11]He's way too far behind now.
[42:40.27]Hey, thank you!
[42:43.82]I can't believe you finished ahead of me.
[42:44.98]I can't believe I could collect the butterflies.
[42:47.02]Hand over that pagey.
[42:56.89]Snake.
[42:57.27]Ah, I gotta look behind me.
[42:59.89]That was cute.
[43:01.57]Hey, thank you, the red.
[43:03.83]The red.
[43:04.57]For ten bucks.
[43:05.35]It says, I love you.
[43:06.21]Thank you, red.
[43:08.16]Sprite.
[43:08.78]Sprite.
[43:09.36]Sprite take.
[43:10.74]Thanks for the five bucks.
[43:11.50]Will you reassemble the goof guys for White Noise 2?
[43:14.18]Me and Etalyx were actually looking at that game.
[43:17.12]We wanted to give it a try.
[43:19.82]We thought it looked kind of funny.
[43:20.81]We did play White Noise online.
[43:23.43]And that would be a good thing to play.
[43:26.20]So yes, we have taken a look at that.
[43:28.56]Fake Grumbo gave $10.
[43:30.98]It cost $400,000 to watch Jerma stream for 12 seconds.
[43:36.00]Not true.
[43:36.54]What's wrong with this guy?
[43:40.71]Thank you, Lizard95 for the $15.
[43:42.47]Born and raised in Mattapan, you gave me another reason to be proud of my Boston Strong.
[43:48.95]Also, has the milk in your handbag gone bad yet?
[43:52.53]Well, no, it has not.
[43:53.63]It's still being stored in the fridge.
[43:55.37]And Mattapan, cool.
[43:57.19]The local Boston area boy.
[44:00.76]It's good to know that there are people from around the area that watch.
[44:02.70]That's cool.
[44:05.12]So much love to you, dude.
[44:06.24]Thanks for sticking around.
[44:06.82]Thanks for watching.
[44:08.60]And also Neotox.
[44:10.16]Neotox gave $50.
[44:11.52]Let me see what it says.
[44:12.74]I need to scroll down a second here.
[44:15.38]$50 says, I haven't participated in a money stream in a while, so have some snake money.
[44:20.49]Thanks for all the laughs through the years.
[44:21.53]Well, thank you for the $50.
[44:22.99]And then ILoveDonuts also gave $50.
[44:24.51]It says, for XboxGamer969.
[44:27.03]Wait, is that supposed to be me?
[44:30.43]XboxGamer969?
[44:30.77]Well, thank you.
[44:37.35]Enforcers are thrown in this jungle.
[44:38.61]I haven't been like... What?
[44:41.05]What happened?
[44:42.63]Oh, because I dumped a drink there accidentally.
[44:44.65]My other pieces have been scattered nearby.
[44:46.67]So I gotta collect some scattered pieces.
[44:48.12]Bad desktop.
[44:48.60]Get Windows 10.
[44:49.18]Actually, I think... When does the... 2020, right?
[44:50.48]Or 2018?
[44:50.64]When it runs out?
[45:03.68]Alright, let's go.
[45:04.68]Let's collect the pieces.
[45:12.47]And then Styx running again.
[45:13.65]Styx says, if off-topic question, I've been to Mass only a few times, mainly for Minato's Buffet in round one.
[45:20.55]Ever been there?
[45:22.23]Never?
[45:22.69]Not sure.
[45:24.55]Hopefully it was good.
[45:25.89]I only have a year.
[45:28.88]Oh well.
[45:31.30]Where are these guys?
[45:32.12]Oh, they're already...
[45:35.21]One out of three, and then there's like Miss Piggy down here.
[45:38.47]Candy Cane Pig.
[45:40.22]Did I not be doing it?
[45:41.70]Uh, let's see.
[45:44.24]Good day to you, young warrior.
[45:47.46]I bet you've got a weight-related name, so go on, what is it?
[45:51.59]Okay, let's see.
[45:54.79]That is a weight-related name.
[45:59.43]I knew it!
[45:59.91]Carry on then, tell us about your brave quest for treasure.
[46:05.30]Who cares?
[46:05.74]Just give me the puzzle piece.
[46:08.22]Just let me rip the puzzle piece, like, out of your stomach.
[46:10.23]That's what I probably have to do.
[46:11.13]Om nom nom.
[46:15.09]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[46:15.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:16.47]Alright, what do you want?
[46:17.69]What do you want me to do?
[46:18.37]Yes!
[46:18.91]We're doing it.
[46:22.40]Don't worry, Sir Scoffs-a-Lot.
[46:25.39]Excellent!
[46:25.79]My first night isn't far.
[46:26.93]Allow one to become a clue.
[46:29.87]My feet are wet, but do not fret.
[46:31.09]I won't drown by this corporal town.
[46:33.53]Got it!
[46:33.89]If we forget, we'll come back and ask you again.
[46:35.79]Okay.
[46:37.33]So.
[46:40.26]What the f- What the hell was that?
[46:41.18]I thought this was, like, one of her friends.
[46:43.78]Apparently not.
[46:46.60]Well.
[46:47.58]We need to find the other three pieces.
[46:49.12]There's another one.
[46:49.68]There's another one.
[46:51.20]You just signed your soul away to a pig.
[46:55.44]Is that what I did?
[46:56.12]Who cares?
[46:59.51]My soul was fucking fragmented anyways.
[47:04.03]I think I still would be in this area.
[47:05.23]Let's just do the dash!
[47:06.41]One more piece.
[47:08.75]Behind her?
[47:10.39]I don't think I'm supposed to be up here.
[47:21.19]No.
[47:23.33]Where is the last piece?
[47:28.64]Oh, maybe up there?
[47:30.59]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[47:32.65]I don't know.
[47:33.39]That's loud as fuck, though.
[47:35.89]There it is.
[47:37.79]Alright.
[47:39.15]That was much easier than the race.
[47:41.09]Oh, that's all of them.
[47:42.56]I'll come back then.
[47:43.44]Assemble me!
[47:45.22]Okay.
[47:45.70]Hi.
[47:46.08]I'm free!
[47:59.40]Go play Dark Souls?
[48:00.28]I already, I already beat it.
[48:04.94]Oh, you just take him?
[48:06.96]That's kind of... Okay.
[48:09.52]Hmm, do I want to go over there?
[48:11.36]I want to go over there.
[48:13.69]I skipped it.
[48:16.95]Play anything besides Dark Souls.
[48:18.27]What do you have against Dark Souls?
[48:22.25]I wouldn't play Dark Souls 1.
[48:23.43]There's no way.
[48:26.45]This guy, what does this guy want?
[48:30.59]I was up here earlier.
[48:31.29]Can't figure out what the hell that is.
[48:39.22]Can you please do a Billy Mays impression, says Lumped Milk.
[48:42.81]I don't think I can do Billy Mays here.
[48:45.42]Really, anybody can, you know, I take that back.
[48:47.39]Anybody can do Billy Mays.
[48:48.17]You wanna know how you do Billy Mays?
[48:50.07]You just talk really loud.
[48:52.65]And, like, put your nose in the air and kind of tilt your throat back.
[48:58.75]So, let's give it a try.
[48:59.99]Just talk very loudly with an enthusiastic voice.
[49:02.44]And you can, hey, I can do Billy Mays.
[49:06.26]Hi, Billy Mays here!
[49:07.68]See?
[49:08.86]That's all you have to do.
[49:10.08]I'm assuming I have to... Okay, he needs to shoot this.
[49:13.42]What?
[49:14.00]What?
[49:17.12]Okay, I'm missing something, though.
[49:18.82]Doesn't he- doesn't- wouldn't you think you have to, like, shoot that?
[49:20.82]No, I don't want to die in Yooka-Laylee, so we're gonna leave.
[49:28.44]Figure that out later.
[49:32.66]Holy cow, you're right.
[49:33.60]Oh, there's Sandy!
[49:34.24]From SpongeBob!
[49:36.16]It's- it's reverse Sandy.
[49:38.87]Okay.
[49:40.65]Instead of air, she's breathing water.
[49:42.11]Cool.
[49:47.25]Allow me to introduce myself.
[49:48.37]I'm Dr. Puzz.
[49:51.35]Okay.
[49:53.83]Dr. Quack stole all of my research.
[49:55.69]Oh, Dr. Quack, you're not gonna do it.
[50:00.43]I am gonna do it.
[50:02.01]What's wrong with her arms?
[50:03.79]She's like a fucking octopus, right?
[50:07.72]Hi Dr. Puzzle, I'm Yuga and this is Laylee.
[50:09.38]Looks like you're experiencing some tentacle or technical... Alright, I... It's cute.
[50:16.57]It's cute.
[50:16.91]There you go.
[50:17.65]You got me to say it.
[50:19.55]You did get me to say it once.
[50:22.49]I'm not gonna say that again.
[50:23.15]I'm not gonna say it's cute again.
[50:24.55]I'm not gonna say it's cute.
[50:29.90]Sandy plus Squidward.
[50:31.10]Okay.
[50:41.81]Okay.
[50:42.51]So do I have to just let it shoot me?
[50:45.75]I, like, skipped all that.
[50:51.71]Let's see.
[50:52.63]Give me, like, the Dark Souls, you talk to an NPC too many times.
[50:57.74]Gotta find a molecule.
[50:58.98]Okay.
[51:02.06]I have no idea what that means.
[51:06.89]Uh... There's a lot of just random characters.
[51:13.55]Got no business with you, lizard.
[51:15.01]Can I, like, shit in his head?
[51:19.36]Okay, I'm gonna, like, jump up and, like, squat down and shit in his head.
[51:24.50]And the whole time he's gonna be like, No, no, no, no, no, shit, I don't know how to do math problems anymore!
[51:29.26]That's what it's gonna do.
[51:32.53]I feel like I need to get a new move to do this or something.
[51:38.47]Oh wait, what was that?
[51:44.76]Okay.
[51:45.44]Well, whatever.
[51:49.46]Why are you like this?
[51:52.00]I'm gonna ask my parents.
[51:55.84]Ask my parents and ask, ask like, ask like Ren and Stimpy.
[52:00.62]Anytime somebody asks me why I'm like this, why am I like this?
[52:04.30]Just go watch an episode of Ren and Stimpy.
[52:08.14]That's it.
[52:08.46]That's what I used to watch when I was younger.
[52:11.86]This fucked me up for life.
[52:16.60]Anything in these boxes?
[52:20.86]Probably not.
[52:24.58]Um... Alright, how's everybody's nostalgia meter doing?
[52:38.85]You guys have like, is the nostalgia meter really like, going like, off for you guys?
[52:51.92]The toothache episode.
[52:53.98]Oh god.
[52:55.80]Oh, there was so many fucking outrageous, awful Ren and Stimpy episodes.
[53:00.39]10 out of 10.
[53:07.85]I'm just gonna get a running start here.
[53:09.21]Okay, can I, like, jump from here to there?
[53:16.55]Yeah, I just did, like, a new move and I didn't know I could do that.
[53:18.43]Okay.
[53:23.86]Um, I guess I could get up there, but I don't have... Can I not open that?
[53:26.36]I'm sure they've got the random characters.
[53:30.10]I don't know.
[53:30.42]Let's just go over here.
[53:36.04]Gotta do the dash.
[53:37.42]This way first.
[53:59.63]Hmm... I don't see anything up here.
[54:02.17]I don't... Ah, wait, I do.
[54:03.97]But can I... Alright, we're gonna go with the shirt thing first.
[54:10.13]This way.
[54:12.65]Ready?
[54:13.63]3, 2, 1.
[54:16.89]Just like in Super Mario 64!
[54:19.84]I remember that game.
[54:20.92]I remember the Nintendo 64.
[54:23.58]Cool system.
[54:38.52]sorry we're right we're right there we're back pages from kgs pages from cages is that what it is those are kgs
[55:10.15]Mm-hmm.
[55:13.75]Is he gonna turn on and hit me?
[55:15.59]I think, yeah, probably.
[55:21.54]Yeah.
[55:25.10]Did I die in a kid's game?
[55:26.16]This is not a kid's game.
[55:27.06]What are you talking about?
[55:28.44]The only reason with that... They made this game for one reason.
[55:32.53]Because, like, fucking dumbass shitty adults like me get off on, like, this nostalgia crap.
[55:39.94]Like, that's why they made this game.
[55:41.06]They didn't make this game for kids.
[55:41.94]They made this game for me.
[55:42.99]Like, 30-year-old fucking losers that, like, I remember Banjo-Kazooie!
[55:46.39]Yeah, I love that game!
[55:47.79]I'll buy it!
[55:48.81]50 bucks!
[56:03.78]Sometimes you gotta be honest with yourself.
[56:07.38]How the fuck do I get up there?
[56:15.40]Guess I can't get up there.
[56:18.86]Is it worth it?
[56:19.32]Oh, I'm not sure.
[56:21.60]Seems pretty decent so far.
[56:24.63]Don't!
[56:26.87]Can I, like, break a wall or something?
[56:28.77]Oh, I can get in there.
[56:33.21]That's all that was in here?
[56:34.01]I was just like a dead guy?
[56:35.50]Come on, what?
[56:48.80]Like I said, what can I even do up here?
[56:50.16]I don't think there's anything I can even do.
[56:55.27]Ah, well, I know I could go in the tower.
[56:56.99]What's in here?
[57:02.13]Anything?
[57:04.37]No.
[57:06.65]Nice secret.
[57:12.28]What about over here?
[57:15.70]I gotta wake this guy up apparently somehow and that makes him put the platform up.
[57:23.74]This is a pretty cool Easter egg.
[57:26.46]Yeah, that was a nice Easter egg.
[57:31.03]Ow.
[57:31.31]Can I eat like the chrome flowers?
[57:41.99]Well, I guess we're going this way.
[57:44.50]Oh, there's a skeleton.
[57:52.04]Seem to have gotten myself into a pot of bother.
[58:03.21]This is real great.
[58:04.39]Really great, uh...
[58:09.24]Thanks, game.
[58:10.62]Really appreciate it.
[58:12.24]Nice.
[58:13.32]Now get up there.
[58:21.00]Why can they move around in the cutscenes?
[58:22.32]That doesn't seem fair.
[58:23.23]That's gonna happen again.
[58:24.13]That's gonna happen again, isn't it?
[58:26.89]No.
[58:26.99]Okay, good.
[58:27.73]Can I just knock him over?
[58:36.11]She's looking a bit malnourished.
[58:39.07]Cripes.
[58:40.75]Thank goodness you're here.
[58:41.67]I've been getting out by these things.
[58:43.33]Why does this thing have an Australian accent?
[58:45.63]And they're going to cook me.
[58:48.43]If they're hungry, they'll need a character a bit more fleshed out than you like.
[58:53.56]Of course.
[58:53.90]Seems you just can't be a world-class explorer these days.
[58:56.94]Without being cooked, mate.
[58:59.68]Help me escape, and I'll reward you with a paging.
[59:02.45]But be quick!
[59:03.51]My captors will be back any minute!
[59:05.71]With their... condiments!
[59:08.79]Okay, let's get her out of here.
[59:13.41]Step away from the pot stream, dinosaur!
[59:24.70]Oh, great.
[59:25.16]So it's just waves of enemies.
[59:26.58]They're not even attacking.
[59:34.92]They're just screaming and running.
[59:35.96]Lizard and bat go good with skeleton soup.
[59:43.49]Add much body.
[59:45.41]Okay.
[59:46.81]I'm gonna eat this one.
[59:52.77]Mmm, I'm tasty.
[59:53.81]You guys suck.
[60:04.01]This is so cute, I'm gonna die.
[60:05.51]Is this game going to console?
[60:11.00]Is this game on console?
[60:14.44]Alright, so where's my puzzle piece?
[60:17.80]Okay.
[60:23.32]Take your reward, you earned it.
[60:32.13]No-hit boss run incoming?
[60:35.05]Expand a world!
[60:36.14]I can open a new world, huh?
[60:38.78]Meet me at the Grand Tome entrance when you're ready, and I'll explain.
[60:43.22]Let's go somewhere else.
[61:01.95]Did the enemies even attack?
[61:02.99]Doesn't seem like it.
[61:05.44]Not yet, at least.
[61:07.78]Oh, sorry, what I meant to say was to answer that question.
[61:10.92]We're back!
[61:19.87]And alive, it seems!
[61:21.01]That snake chap lost snake!
[61:22.49]Gonna do a snake check.
[61:25.87]Hold on.
[61:26.87]I just got the fucking chills.
[61:28.07]I forgot he existed.
[61:33.64]Jesus.
[61:36.40]I don't see him.
[61:40.76]Okay.
[61:42.14]Those grand tombs can be dangerous places, but it's good.
[61:44.84]You're back.
[61:46.38]I have something important to share.
[61:47.72]The grand tombs, like this one here, can be expanded using the power of friendship.
[61:54.38]You've found... ...bigger and full of extra challenges to discover.
[62:01.90]Once you've found enough of us Pagies, it's up to you if you want to use this big badass tool.
[62:07.42]Or search Hybrid Towers for a brand new one to unlock with us.
[62:10.10]The choice is yours, and you can do this in order, as long as you have collected enough Pagies on your adventure.
[62:20.47]Step on the switch in front of the Grand Tomb and press A, I'll tell you how many Pagies are required to be spent.
[62:32.34]I kind of want to see one of the other worlds.
[62:34.22]Let's check another world out and see how far we need to go.
[62:38.88]Do I want to expand that one or do I want to check out a new one?
[62:42.90]Let's check a new one out.
[62:46.73]I have three.
[62:47.29]I'm going to assume the next one is three, right?
[62:49.73]How do I open this?
[62:57.53]Oh.
[63:01.06]Oh, there's Spongebob.
[63:03.28]Gary!
[63:08.14]It's me, Spongebob!
[63:09.20]You wanna know how to do the Spongebob laugh?
[63:14.80]Take your finger, put it on the bottom of your throat, and shake up and down.
[63:19.38]And go... Ow!
[63:21.80]Ow, fuck, that hurt!
[63:22.94]Don't do that, nobody do that!
[63:24.60]Don't do that, I just hurt myself.
[63:28.71]I actually hurt myself, don't do that.
[63:31.94]Great bit.
[63:34.22]I actually fucked up my esophagus.
[64:00.23]failed pac-man character only one tonic equipped at a time comes to me when you want to swap them out there's like upgrades in this game too interesting
[64:30.84]Can't press that button yet.
[64:31.88]Well, maybe I can.
[64:32.90]Where are we going?
[64:34.92]Uh... Shipwreck Creek.
[64:46.79]Oh, this is just back up to where I was.
[64:48.07]Okay.
[64:49.55]It's like a fucking team mascot.
[64:55.89]The music is too loud.
[64:58.33]It's kind of hard to turn it down.
[64:59.19]It's pretty low at the moment.
[65:05.54]um maybe I have to do that I don't think there's nowhere else I can really go is there I came down here oh I'm like look I didn't look both ways before I crossed the street right there sorry wait what does that do why does he have a smiling face yo is this game lit uh I
[65:32.84]I don't know yet.
[65:34.32]I don't know yet.
[65:37.04]Maybe.
[65:37.32]Let's go up here.
[65:41.95]New zone?
[65:42.63]New spot?
[65:44.39]No?
[65:46.35]Maybe I can only go there right now.
[66:00.63]How do a lizard... What?
[66:02.03]Oh, they're doing the Gruntilda thing.
[66:07.77]I don't even... Whatever.
[66:10.34]I have no idea.
[66:11.12]This seems like the only one place to go right now.
[66:13.02]Let's just do... I don't know.
[66:14.20]Should I expand this universe?
[66:33.27]I'm gonna do it.
[66:33.81]I mean, like, yeah, let's do it.
[66:39.08]I'm curious.
[66:47.28]Is this game shit like everybody says?
[66:49.20]Um... No, here, I've been playing for, like, just over an hour.
[66:52.70]They'll tell you.
[66:55.92]I'll tell you how I'm in no way impressed by this game.
[67:01.39]Not at all.
[67:02.91]But I'm not, like, disappointed.
[67:04.75]I'm not having a bad time.
[67:08.95]I think it's a cute game.
[67:09.71]I think it's fun.
[67:10.35]I think it's interesting enough.
[67:11.85]Am I impressed?
[67:12.51]Absolutely not.
[67:14.33]I'm not, like, blown away by this.
[67:16.11]It's just kind of weird.
[67:24.39]Okay, well, that opened up.
[67:25.35]I don't know where that... Oh, behind him?
[67:27.51]Okay.
[67:28.57]Shovel Knight.
[67:31.73]Okay, the Shovel Knight guy.
[67:32.73]The developer of Shovel Knight gave, like, 50 grand, I think, right?
[67:35.65]That's why he was in the game.
[67:38.76]Well, we're gonna have to go take a look.
[67:41.72]Wherever these places are.
[67:48.74]If Banjo-Kazooie were released today, it would be kind of shitty, too.
[67:52.51]Um... I mean, it's possible, but... It's hard to say stuff like that, because there's no way to know.
[67:59.12]Because back then, that was, like, very innovative, and... Open world games where you could kind of go into the game and do whatever you want.
[68:08.44]You could go to get this puzzle piece.
[68:10.28]You could go try this challenge.
[68:12.40]That was still very new.
[68:14.62]That wasn't a thing that every game was trying to complete.
[68:20.59]It was a formula that just barely started existing.
[68:23.53]Like, over the course of that, like, five years or so.
[68:25.31]Let's just go in here.
[68:33.26]Oh.
[68:40.36]Okay.
[68:42.66]I just Scooby-Dooed out the other side.
[68:44.06]Let's go see Shovel Knight.
[68:46.37]Alright, you ready for him to give his Shovel Knight code?
[68:51.87]She's gonna say, like, oh, what am I doing?
[68:54.33]I'm lost in this world.
[68:55.58]I've never been here before.
[68:56.66]How did I get here?
[68:58.98]Guaranteed.
[68:59.42]Ready?
[69:01.23]Oh, I'm a stranger.
[69:02.01]How did I end up in a place like this?
[69:05.25]There he goes.
[69:06.31]Oh, greetings, adventurers.
[69:07.45]I'm the one they call Shovel Knight, and I'm having an eventful day.
[69:10.39]Oh, I guess I got lost.
[69:11.57]I seem to have embarked on such a grand adventure that I've ended up in the wrong game.
[69:16.81]I told you there appears to be some alluring treasure hidden at the top of this temple.
[69:25.13]However, I'm having trouble reaching it.
[69:27.25]I haven't gotten used to this bizarre third dimension.
[69:31.80]Retrieve the giant jewel from me, and I'll reveal to thou the great secret to succeed in any adventure.
[69:36.51]Alright.
[69:40.01]See, I fucking told you.
[69:41.67]Excellent.
[69:42.09]Steal thy shovel, friends.
[69:43.57]I'll be waiting here for your safe return.
[69:45.47]Please buy my game.
[69:46.69]That was cute.
[69:54.14]That was cute.
[69:57.22]Come on.
[69:57.76]Let's give it a little bit of a break.
[69:58.78]Come on, that was cute.
[70:08.37]Is this a cannon?
[70:10.03]That's cool.
[70:13.05]Mmm, pick up the feathers.
[70:16.43]Don't want to lose any of those.
[70:18.06]Yeah, I found the hidden Shovel Knight Easter Egg.
[70:22.14]I'm gonna piss on the flowers to make them grow.
[70:29.52]What's that?
[70:37.24]I hope he says how expensive the game is too.
[70:39.16]How funny would that be?
[70:41.22]He's taking a look.
[70:43.52]Why would this be here if there was no reason to look down there?
[70:46.92]Fucking god damn it.
[70:53.07]I gave it too much of a look.
[71:12.28]So many people would have done that, right?
[71:13.76]Like, it's okay.
[71:14.60]Dying doesn't matter in this game.
[71:16.28]I was checking to find, like, a secret.
[71:24.47]And apparently there's no reason for that, so it doesn't matter.
[71:26.43]And what is this?
[71:27.35]It's like a weird button.
[71:28.97]What about this side?
[71:33.35]What is that?
[71:34.95]What the fuck?
[71:37.89]Come on!
[71:40.31]Now I'm, like, stuck over here.
[71:41.35]No, I'm not.
[71:42.29]Okay, I'm getting too, like, obsessed with, like, the weird hidden developer secrets instead of just beating the level.
[71:58.30]Okay, up there.
[72:00.80]No game over.
[72:02.18]Why are these not moving anymore?
[72:09.32]Uh, hello?
[72:12.59]Why are these no longer moving?
[72:16.05]I didn't break the game, did I?
[72:17.47]I think I broke the game.
[72:23.50]Yeah, I think so.
[72:24.66]You tell me I have to do it like this?
[72:32.53]Where's like the button I have to press?
[72:39.58]Swear to God.
[72:42.24]I will get this, but I just have to reload the level and I'm not doing that.
[72:46.14]Oh my God.
[72:55.09]Didn't even need that fucking shit to work.
[72:56.65]It's like a snow button?
[73:06.48]Ice button, okay.
[73:11.10]This is cute.
[73:13.02]This is cute.
[73:14.28]What's the purpose of this?
[73:17.70]Press the button.
[73:21.91]I can't press the button.
[73:23.11]I can't do anything.
[73:26.25]Can I not?
[73:26.91]No, there's no pressing buttons.
[73:29.97]Needed ability.
[73:30.67]There's another one underneath, too, that I don't see.
[73:38.80]Watch out for these guys.
[73:41.64]Ow.
[73:42.08]I just said to watch out for these guys.
[73:44.82]Okay, you gotta knock their eyeballs out of this skull.
[73:48.28]That's how you win.
[73:51.37]Cool.
[73:54.37]Anything to do with this guy?
[73:55.19]He's got a big red eye.
[73:56.07]Okay, that's, um... That's Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget.
[74:06.47]Didn't he look like that?
[74:08.55]Claw?
[74:10.19]The guy with the really terrible voice?
[74:13.65]The guy with the- okay, any time you ask somebody to do like a bad guy voice, that's the one that they're gonna probably do and it's really, really not good.
[74:22.55]This one.
[74:23.51]The one where people do this.
[74:25.35]That's not a good voice.
[74:26.49]That's a terrible villain.
[74:28.26]That just sounds like a guy trying to do a shitty fucking bad guy voice.
[74:31.80]It's not good.
[74:35.55]What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[74:45.99]Gollum's dad?
[74:46.79]No, look it up!
[74:47.79]Fenrir from Smite, also.
[74:49.14]It's awful.
[74:52.50]Can I not do anything with this?
[74:53.72]Do I have to, like, press all of the fucking buttons?
[75:04.13]I don't know.
[75:07.55]I'm not supposed to be here.
[75:25.08]Well, this was a waste of time, it seems like.
[75:26.78]No, I'm not prepared.
[75:30.94]I'm not ready.
[75:31.62]I'm not ready for this.
[75:34.10]So the Shovel Knight guy set me up here for no reason.
[75:40.50]Okay.
[75:43.50]Those jumping sounds are absolutely not going to get annoying.
[75:51.31]The flower... Yeah, but I can't... I don't think I can do anything with it.
[75:56.97]I think I need to get, like, the water or ice ability or something, right?
[76:07.70]Am I serious?
[76:11.02]Wait, what?
[76:12.00]What are you guys talking about?
[76:17.18]What am I supposed to do about this?
[76:18.14]I can't, like, activate it.
[76:20.36]Like, there was supposed to be a cutscene?
[76:25.85]No, there wasn't.
[76:33.47]Is he telling me that I have to come back up here?
[76:42.46]Okay.
[76:43.20]Oh, hey, right in front of Shovel Knight, sorry!
[76:59.05]How does the adventure go?
[77:01.39]You didn't do it yet.
[77:02.38]There's another ghost.
[77:26.38]Where's that stupid ass snake?
[77:29.18]Like, really?
[77:31.52]I'm just like... Alright, where's the snake?
[77:35.44]Do I have to go back to the fucking snake guy?
[77:38.49]Let's just go over here.
[77:44.79]Where is Trousers?
[77:47.11]He's back here, right?
[77:47.91]Isn't he, like, here?
[77:48.53]He's in the wall.
[77:56.89]Speaking of... I'm doing a snake check.
[77:58.27]I don't see him.
[78:07.95]Where did Snake Man go?
[78:08.79]It's in the pan.
[78:13.97]It's in my pan.
[78:17.35]Is he on every level, or is he on, like, down here?
[78:19.87]Doesn't he like standing here?
[78:30.26]He's outside, right?
[78:31.46]Will he actually be there?
[78:32.98]He'll be somewhere in the level, really.
[78:35.68]God damn it.
[78:36.28]So he's not going to be out here.
[78:38.66]I'm glad they brought this shit back from, like, fucking 1997.
[78:45.57]What?
[79:01.16]Where's the movies?
[79:04.76]Uh, you'll see it soon.
[79:11.03]What is wrong with that fridge?
[79:12.23]There's a post on my subreddit confirming I'm 5'3".
[79:18.49]Well, I am not 5'3".
[79:20.79]I'm like, I'm 5'8".
[79:22.77]So, sorry to burst your bubble.
[79:25.49]Hey!
[79:27.75]Yeah!
[79:28.85]Hey!
[79:32.55]5-7 on a bad day.
[79:33.75]Alright, uh, let's just go.
[79:38.17]Okay, there's like, there's Spongebob again.
[79:39.78]Hold on.
[79:42.30]Do I go in this temple?
[79:54.06]He hit 4-8.
[79:54.48]Who the fuck is this?
[80:00.07]Good day, strapping adventurer.
[80:01.11]Splendid day for a hunt, what not?
[80:04.08]It's the crazy frog.
[80:06.62]Old fucking video.
[80:07.82]That is seriously so old.
[80:35.79]Okay, unblock the windows.
[80:38.57]Okie dokie.
[80:39.71]How does it feel like to be able to reach the top shelf?
[80:43.27]Feels great.
[80:43.81]Feels great, dude.
[80:45.23]Hey, you wanna race me again?
[81:05.47]Oh, we can't race again.
[81:07.93]Alright.
[81:12.18]I want to just get up there.
[81:17.90]Mm-hmm.
[81:22.30]The sleeping guy.
[81:23.12]Hey, look!
[81:25.06]There's Tony the Trouser Snake!
[81:27.14]I mean, Tony the... I mean, come on, he has trousers.
[81:34.15]It's not what I meant, but it is what I meant.
[81:39.48]But actually, he is Trouser.
[81:40.96]That is his name.
[81:41.72]His name is Trouser.
[81:43.06]Okay.
[82:03.04]Sonar shot, slurp shot, body slam.
[82:05.63]I guess I'll have this one.
[82:14.55]Yes.
[82:24.60]And then it's go... Right?
[82:27.12]Okay.
[82:27.40]Yeah!
[82:52.31]I'm not even fucking reading this.
[82:55.69]Give me the body slam, too.
[82:57.81]Play banjo on stream instead?
[82:59.25]Well, this is new!
[83:21.99]Alright.
[83:25.13]Jump into the air with A, then press left trigger to send our green friend here slamming towards the floor, causing massive damage.
[83:38.66]Yeah!
[83:40.00]Yeah!
[83:40.80]Okay, so I can't get the other one.
[83:48.01]That's what this one is.
[83:50.85]So how do you do the other one?
[83:54.43]How do you, like, eat a flower or something?
[83:58.15]Okay.
[84:00.87]Yeah, this is his... Cool.
[84:09.33]Block.
[84:10.69]These things are blocked.
[84:11.35]Get rid of them.
[84:14.39]He's gonna say something.
[84:15.11]Please don't say something every time.
[84:18.26]Any updates on Mr. Snake?
[84:19.46]No, not yet.
[84:20.14]I don't see him.
[84:22.40]He went in my back wall over there.
[84:23.92]Hopefully he just went back outside.
[84:27.02]Wait a minute.
[84:29.69]Wait a minute.
[84:31.27]Hold on.
[84:31.45]Hold on a second.
[84:36.81]Nope.
[84:37.27]Okay.
[84:37.81]Just a shadow.
[84:42.99]No, we're good.
[84:43.47]It was a shadow.
[84:47.22]Back down inside.
[84:48.20]What the hell does she have to say?
[84:52.48]Ready to equip a new tonic.
[84:54.48]No.
[84:58.16]Is there a snake cam?
[84:58.85]There will be if he shows up again.
[85:07.29]A snake snuck into my room.
[85:08.37]Yeah, go look at my Twitter.
[85:10.57]It was like a little baby snake that got into the house somehow.
[85:13.40]Don't ask me how.
[85:20.24]Wait, what do I need?
[85:21.13]What?
[85:24.41]More windows?
[85:32.11]I thought I said there was only three.
[85:37.31]Did I not get all three of them?
[85:38.89]I have no fucking idea.
[85:42.29]I guess I didn't do it.
[85:47.92]Okay.
[85:50.00]Sure.
[85:50.34]Apparently not.
[85:52.60]Oh my god.
[85:53.70]You're killing me here, game.
[85:55.00]This one just didn't get this button.
[85:58.73]Oh my god.
[85:59.29]Okay.
[85:59.51]I don't know what the hell's going on.
[86:13.89]I know where that was.
[86:14.79]You don't have to, like, do that to me.
[86:17.57]I know where that was.
[86:18.97]Oh, I want that.
[86:23.21]Shit.
[86:26.35]What are these character designs?
[86:32.12]That's a good question.
[86:35.56]They're very weird.
[86:42.47]I couldn't count to four, that's correct.
[86:44.89]Well, I saw him say three- hold on, what was that?
[86:56.11]Hold on, quiet.
[86:56.61]I fucking heard something.
[87:00.66]Alright, give me my piece.
[87:06.64]I'm gonna take on his target challenge.
[87:12.61]Uh, sure.
[87:16.76]Yes.
[87:21.30]Hey, Duke Nukem, thank you for the five dollars.
[87:23.62]They say, give me your best five dollar pun.
[87:26.42]Uh... Uh...
[87:43.19]Lamb and sheep's clothing.
[87:44.11]No, that's... Hey, you know, I'll tell you something about that sheep.
[87:56.53]He's pretty stupid.
[87:57.73]He don't know mutton about nothing.
[88:00.39]There you go.
[88:04.81]No, he don't know mutton.
[88:07.46]There you go.
[88:12.21]I think you alley play for the $5.
[88:13.27]And stick to Renegade for $5 again!
[88:16.73]Stupid!
[88:22.31]How do I do the challenge?
[88:27.74]Easy.
[88:32.86]You get what you pay for.
[88:33.94]That was not a $1000 joke, guys.
[88:53.78]Come on!
[88:54.36]Show yourself!
[88:55.40]Alright, let me tell you right now.
[89:01.52]This sucks.
[89:05.96]How am I supposed to do this?
[89:07.10]There's gotta be a way to aim this, right?
[89:09.62]Like L1 or something?
[89:11.14]Hey, I did it.
[89:25.87]Okay, that's way better.
[89:27.07]Thank God.
[89:34.85]And yup.
[89:38.15]Nice, you unlocked a new tonic.
[89:39.67]Come pay me a visit.
[89:44.93]Yeah, I could do without the jumping sound.
[89:48.23]Yeah.
[89:55.09]I mean, when Super Mario does it, it's endearing.
[90:00.79]But when Yooka-Laylee does it, it's just kind of like... It's kind of like, shut up, you know?
[90:06.07]Alright, uh, where was she?
[90:11.05]She was over here.
[90:11.71]Mmm, do I have to pay for this shit?
[90:21.44]How much is this?
[90:26.36]Frigilating.
[90:27.90]Wellard.
[90:28.34]Gain plus one butterfly health slot.
[90:32.63]Okay.
[90:36.39]What, I can only have one at a time or something?
[90:39.33]I guess.
[90:39.61]Alright, well now I have that, I'm gonna go back to the top of the mountain.
[90:43.63]Which was over hard.
[90:44.51]We can go to the Shovel Knight quest.
[90:47.65]We can go get the quest.
[90:49.13]Anybody remember that?
[91:04.42]Okay, well, I can burn.
[91:05.48]Burn!
[91:09.36]Shovel Knight!
[91:10.48]Activate!
[91:15.74]Pretend it's Bloodborne?
[91:17.53]I really hope this is not a waste of time.
[91:18.93]You know, this would be sort of a- Wait a minute!
[91:25.77]Wait a minute!
[91:26.23]What about this?
[91:31.54]Oh, that freezes it in place.
[91:38.56]Who cares?
[91:40.63]That is so useless.
[91:41.65]I mean, like... Who cares?
[91:49.57]That's not really that... That's like... That is a serious who cares moment for me.
[91:54.68]Who cares?
[91:55.10]Was I not... I wasn't supposed to even get up here.
[92:01.54]And that's what happened.
[92:07.56]I wasn't even supposed to be up here.
[92:11.59]And I somehow managed to get through.
[92:14.83]Ow, what the fuck?
[92:17.79]So what are these doing here?
[92:20.93]Oh.
[92:23.99]I wasn't even supposed to be up here.
[92:25.53]I love that.
[92:35.00]I don't even need to do this.
[92:35.90]I got up here in a shorter time than it's taking me to hit this shit.
[92:38.82]Do you know what I mean?
[92:41.18]Like, why am I doing this?
[92:42.18]I got up there in one second last time.
[92:44.93]I did it in one jump.
[92:48.43]Just go.
[92:49.11]Why am I doing this?
[92:49.77]It's a waste of time.
[92:57.34]Like, look, I didn't fucking even need that shit.
[93:05.53]I got up there on the first try.
[93:06.63]Now let's shoot him in the eye.
[93:14.14]There we go.
[93:16.30]Now I got my Shovel Knight quest.
[93:20.60]Great work, friend.
[93:22.70]You retrieved my jewel.
[93:23.98]Now bring it back here.
[93:35.71]I'm back.
[93:38.09]It's just a jewel.
[93:39.77]Oh, thank you.
[93:40.33]Now maybe I'll be able to return to my own world.
[93:42.61]This has been so interesting.
[93:46.85]Check out this guy.
[93:48.76]Greetings, adventurers.
[93:49.58]Wait.
[93:50.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[93:53.58]Take it.
[93:54.22]Yo.
[93:54.40]Yo.
[94:03.63]Okay, we'll find your jewel.
[94:05.65]Here comes the jewel.
[94:08.20]Go back.
[94:10.42]Do you mean this one?
[94:13.62]Wait, you've already been up there without consulting me for adventuring tips?
[94:17.24]Impressive.
[94:20.55]I'll keep that in mind.
[94:21.41]Now it's promised.
[94:22.09]Here's the secret to adventuring success.
[94:26.07]You gotta do the pogo jump.
[94:31.07]Was there the whole time.
[94:32.19]All you need is a map and the thirst for adventure!
[94:35.70]Thank you.
[94:45.02]Oh, now I must be off to my own world.
[94:47.78]Thank you.
[94:49.24]Happy adventuring, friends.
[94:50.24]I'm sure our paths will cross again.
[94:53.69]In your game, hopefully.
[94:55.29]I wouldn't mind hoarding some of that gold.
[94:56.93]Okay, that's the voice I have to do from now on.
[95:02.52]I have to do, like, the Sonic the Hedgehog overacting voice.
[95:12.57]The tropics have been expanded, which means the new treasures are inside!
[95:17.39]Yeah.
[95:20.45]You know what else opened up back here?
[95:23.65]Over here?
[95:35.60]I just burnt that guy.
[95:37.62]Apparently burning them is as much as collecting them.
[95:42.65]Anything over there?
[95:44.39]No.
[95:46.03]Down?
[95:47.75]Yep.
[95:48.85]I mean, there's over there.
[95:55.55]I think I can get up there.
[95:56.57]I can scale that whole thing now.
[95:57.59]Should I spit something in this guy's mouth?
[96:01.33]Let's see if I can.
[96:06.48]Is there a thing to spit in this guy's mouth?
[96:08.62]Maybe.
[96:09.22]I guess not.
[96:13.85]Can I stomp on his head?
[96:15.37]Oh, no.
[96:19.27]Oh well.
[96:20.39]We're going that way.
[96:24.09]Well, now I can talk to you.
[96:25.03]Sorry I've got no business with you, lizard.
[96:31.02]Oh, what a dick.
[96:32.08]Okay.
[96:32.82]Fine.
[96:33.08]Snake check.
[96:34.22]I'm so concerned about this.
[96:36.42]Now what?
[96:59.25]This is just the guy from Mario, um... The big block guy.
[97:01.89]That's fine.
[97:02.29]No, not yet.
[97:02.69]Here we go!
[97:03.53]Yeah... Yeah, just go.
[97:34.74]Boom!
[97:36.04]This is new.
[97:38.16]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[97:42.23]And when you let go of, like, right trigger a little too early, like, you gotta, like, okay.
[97:50.63]I'm, like, I don't like the way this move works with jumping.
[97:56.22]It's, like, it's fucking, shit is, shit is delayed.
[98:07.66]Does it have to be that delayed?
[98:11.55]Why can't I jump now?
[98:12.35]Why do I have to wait, like, a full, like, second and a half?
[98:15.53]This is fucking dumb.
[98:17.43]And now I get to talk to this guy.
[98:24.76]No, apparently not.
[98:25.96]It's the camera just changed.
[98:36.28]I always figured, I always wondered, when they put these flametraps in any game, who are they expecting to enjoy avoiding from?
[98:47.78]They kind of just exist, don't they?
[98:51.20]They're just kind of here.
[98:55.88]That wasn't even out!
[98:56.80]That wasn't even out of the fucking tube!
[98:58.72]Wasn't even out of the tube, rare!
[99:03.22]Wasn't even at a two break.
[99:04.18]Hey, go back to making the fucking shitty car game.
[99:06.80]That you made and it sucked.
[99:08.68]Hold on.
[99:11.12]This ain't even Rare.
[99:24.13]Yeah, nice job Rare.
[99:27.75]We'll make like another like children's Kinect Animal game.
[99:34.65]That was uncalled for.
[99:36.61]Here we go, he's going to spit blocks at me.
[99:39.73]The Great Rampo, ancient angular stone block.
[99:43.95]The Great Rampo has no need for these double glazed windows.
[99:46.61]Salus mortals.
[99:50.29]We're not selling windows.
[99:51.53]We're hunting Pagies.
[99:53.17]I'm Yooka, and this is Le- Whoa!
[99:54.73]I got cut off!
[99:55.43]Silence!
[99:55.93]Great Ripple knows!
[99:56.97]Hustle when he ready!
[99:58.13]You have been bothering every character on this island with your so-called shenanigans.
[100:03.87]You're going to be punished by my ancient slanty powers and old glass peddlers!
[100:09.38]Haha!
[100:10.14]So funny!
[100:16.72]What?
[100:24.07]What just happened?
[100:32.09]What am I... Uh... I'm kind of confused at the moment.
[100:39.60]What do I need to do here?
[100:40.90]Do I need to, like, jump over these?
[100:47.02]No.
[100:47.24]I have to, like, roll up.
[100:48.64]What?
[100:52.79]Which way do I have to go?
[100:53.53]I have no idea what the fuck is going on.
[100:59.11]Baby games too hard.
[101:00.21]I'm not gonna die to this.
[101:02.41]It's just like... Let me take a look for a second.
[101:14.32]I can't even... I can't move the camera.
[101:16.26]The camera just gets locked over here.
[101:17.48]Do I have to just go inside?
[101:20.17]I don't understand.
[101:20.89]Am I supposed to not jump up there?
[101:23.24]The jump button, I can't jump high enough, doesn't do anything.
[101:31.28]Like, I can't jump high enough.
[101:33.80]Okay, what the fuck was that?
[101:35.51]What in the name of God was that?
[101:36.85]What the fuck was that?
[101:38.97]That was just... Un-fucking-believable.
[101:45.43]What in the name of fucking God just happened?
[101:55.83]Holy shit.
[101:59.35]Okay, let's try that again.
[102:00.75]This time, uh, let's just hope that doesn't happen again.
[102:03.46]Where the hell even was that?
[102:09.22]Uh.
[102:10.78]Over here?
[102:12.80]Over there.
[102:13.16]Alright, let's see if that would happen.
[102:16.65]Died on pur- I didn't die on purpose.
[102:18.66]What?
[102:18.96]I was trying to jump up the platform and I got like hit by a log and I went up to the fucking briar patch.
[102:25.02]I didn't do that on purpose.
[102:28.57]Why would I do that on purpose?
[102:29.53]This like sucks to have to go back here again.
[102:31.49]This is like not fun.
[102:32.63]To have to like go all the way back there.
[102:34.83]And I'm like now I don't even know where- I'm like angry so I don't even know where the fuck to go.
[102:37.84]Over there.
[102:39.68]I don't think I can make it up there.
[102:46.61]Good.
[102:46.97]Like, the game just glitched the fuck out.
[102:49.03]Doesn't even matter.
[102:50.37]Okay.
[102:53.34]Go get your souls.
[102:54.60]Do you think I want to do this again?
[102:57.74]I don't want to, like, do the stupid flame trap again.
[103:09.35]Go back to Dark Souls 3, you catch.
[103:12.51]Alright, let's do this again.
[103:19.74]Get out of the way, please.
[103:23.46]Okay, I see, like, a little thing on the right.
[103:24.90]Do I have to go, like, in there?
[103:26.06]And there's a guy behind me.
[103:31.06]And this guy, after the cutscene's over, he's gonna hit me.
[103:34.70]Like, this is the shit that I did.
[103:36.70]They're like, come on now.
[103:38.20]Please tell me he actually left.
[103:39.28]There he is.
[103:42.36]Alright, thank god.
[103:44.20]Pfft.
[103:44.66]Pfft.
[104:05.56]I didn't have to turn the fuck around.
[104:07.36]Oh my god.
[104:09.70]How?
[104:15.20]Because the controls are sloppy.
[104:17.24]That's how.
[104:17.82]And I had to like turn around and fight a fucking cutscene enemy.
[104:22.08]Now I'm just fucking mad.
[104:25.79]Like this is fucking so dumb.
[104:29.17]The game's not bad.
[104:29.75]This is not a bad game.
[104:30.95]Don't worry.
[104:31.29]I'm not like downing the game.
[104:32.69]Now I'm downing the game.
[104:36.99]Um, now I'm dogging again.
[104:45.24]If these geysers weren't here for no reason, I wouldn't have had to, like, turn around to go fucking fight the guy and fall off the bridge.
[105:01.15]I know.
[105:01.45]You don't have to do that.
[105:02.39]And the whole freeze and see the cutscene again.
[105:04.25]I don't need to do that.
[105:06.59]Just let me go in the fucking little micro hole over here.
[105:09.83]Don't fall off that ledge!
[105:11.57]No!
[105:13.57]What?
[105:19.81]It just fucking makes you go off.
[105:22.25]I'm stuck down here.
[105:23.45]No!
[105:24.15]No!
[105:31.50]Where do I go?
[105:39.71]Like, I was trying to get in that hole.
[105:40.99]I did one little jump and I went on top and I said, you can't jump.
[105:44.11]There's nothing you can do.
[105:47.37]What the fuck, man?
[105:50.40]And now I have to fall off the edge.
[105:51.60]Let me find, like, the weird secret developer, like, area.
[106:12.11]So do I not go in that hole?
[106:13.75]Do I just go underneath him?
[106:17.30]Why do I have to think this hard on like this little boss in this like children's Banjo-Kazooie game?
[106:29.47]I'm just like, I'm confused.
[106:31.87]First it was the cloud and now it's this guy.
[106:34.69]Okay, let's go up and do this again.
[106:42.89]Have any of you guys done this?
[106:47.64]You have to like do- What do you have to do?
[106:52.33]If I'm, like, a person that plays a video game, I'm thinking I have to, like, go up and make my way through and hit him, like, in his mouth.
[106:59.86]But how do I make the jump?
[107:00.70]And you can't, like, jump over that ledge.
[107:02.32]The ledge is not... It's too high.
[107:08.32]I could really do without this, by the way.
[107:17.42]Okay, we're going to get into the cutscene again.
[107:19.38]He's going to go, first a good fool.
[107:20.91]There's no way you'll ever defeat me.
[107:27.83]I did, though.
[107:28.23]You literally jumped over the ledge.
[107:31.20]Do I have to go like that?
[107:33.10]I jumped over the ledge, but...
[107:43.70]I didn't jump over the... I jumped over the right ledge.
[107:46.25]I could never get over the front.
[107:47.19]At least I got to see those thrilling fla... Alright, let me just stop for a second.
[107:56.16]This shouldn't be this difficult.
[107:57.56]I swear to god, dude.
[108:02.02]Why does the camera have to be pointing there?
[108:05.34]I can't see where the fuck the next one is.
[108:10.23]Okay, like, it takes like two jumps.
[108:11.73]Okay, hit him in the fucking teeth.
[108:13.69]Okay, I'll just stand right here.
[108:21.24]This is fucking terrible.
[108:22.16]No, I don't want to do that again.
[108:24.66]Oh no, no, I don't want to do that again.
[108:44.99]camera please stop stop this stop this doing okay you wanna know why I keep falling off the edge because the camera just fucking rips you to in a different spot you're like walking in another direction that's what's going on and I don't even know what the pattern is here
[109:18.83]Here comes his fire.
[109:20.47]I don't even care.
[109:30.20]Just please show me your, like, broken ass teeth.
[109:31.92]I'm gonna do it again.
[109:35.24]The bad workman blames his tools.
[109:36.88]No, he blames... He blames a bad jump.
[109:48.65]You have to do everything three times because it's logic.
[109:54.49]Oh no, this is going to be a disaster.
[110:07.18]I have to jump these?
[110:08.10]Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[110:11.12]Hold on a second.
[110:12.28]Like...
[110:16.97]Can you even jump these?
[110:18.89]Have I lost my mind?
[110:21.67]That's a lot more difficult than it needs to be.
[110:35.49]Why is it that hard to, like, get, like, over these logs?
[110:38.09]And here we go, I'm about to fucking fall.
[110:48.51]I'm gonna get hit again and I'm gonna die.
[110:57.42]Why is it starting me here?
[111:01.84]Why is it starting me here?
[111:02.68]It's the first time it's ever happened.
[111:04.46]Did I get the Luigi, you're bad thing?
[111:11.03]Well, now's my chance to just get the hell up there.
[111:12.39]Now I have to do a whole damn thing again.
[111:22.14]Alright, let's go.
[111:25.17]Didn't even unload the assets.
[111:37.25]I love how it pushed me down in like the cutscene and like there's still a log there.
[111:46.78]Oh, okay.
[111:48.34]No, don't speak.
[111:50.62]This is... Oh, God.
[112:04.59]Okay, I can do it.
[112:05.65]Seventh in the world.
[112:07.88]I'm gonna get seventh in the world.
[112:15.63]Can I summon my two friends to beat the game?
[112:17.45]There better not be a log here.
[112:25.99]Stop the loading screen!
[112:27.10]Fucking go!
[112:27.70]What the fuck?
[112:29.42]What?
[112:29.72]That just, like, ruined everything.
[112:33.30]What?
[112:42.73]Oh my god.
[112:43.77]My god.
[112:45.03]My god.
[112:46.43]Why?
[112:46.79]I'm gonna hit every log on the way down.
[112:49.77]Why didn't I get up there?
[112:51.43]Why?
[112:51.95]Come on.
[112:53.71]Now I have to sit down.
[112:55.59]Holy shit.
[112:59.35]Like, why can I not get up it?
[113:01.27]Why does sometimes I just can't get up it?
[113:05.44]I don't understand, dude.
[113:09.94]Like, I have to be going faster.
[113:22.73]How much did this game cost?
[113:24.61]$40.
[113:24.77]Let's try this again.
[113:32.58]I have to wait, because now... Okay, go.
[113:35.50]God, and now he's gonna breathe fucking fire.
[113:37.08]I'm gonna, like, die again.
[113:45.35]Yeah, look, you don't even need to be doing this.
[113:47.67]Just let me see your fucking gross teeth.
[113:51.09]Don't even tell me.
[113:52.41]Don't even seriously tell me that that just happened.
[113:55.56]Don't even tell me that just happened.
[114:00.20]Why did that have to happen?
[114:02.56]Don't get fucking hit.
[114:03.77]Break his last tooth that's right next to the briar patch.
[114:06.27]I thought I just died.
[114:13.83]Oh my god.
[114:15.47]Okay, we beat it.
[114:44.50]Let's break his eyeball.
[114:46.16]Ooh, secret.
[114:50.44]Secret.
[114:50.80]Where does this go?
[114:55.17]Ooh.
[114:55.95]Ooh!
[114:57.05]Cool.
[114:57.67]So does this dude.
[115:00.27]Anything?
[115:01.79]There's got to be a reason for me to come up here, right?
[115:16.67]I don't see anything over there.
[115:17.55]Alright, I guess it's just for fun.
[115:28.09]I guess.
[115:30.37]Okay.
[115:32.73]Uh, thank you party craps for the five dollars.
[115:34.87]This crazy frog wearing a gibbous.
[115:37.13]He kind of was.
[115:37.67]Uh, Devin the magic dog, thank you for five bucks as well.
[115:41.37]This used to be a snake stream.
[115:42.51]It still is.
[115:43.15]He's in the wall somewhere hidden.
[115:46.14]Thank you.
[115:46.76]Thank you, guys.
[115:52.53]Popular YouTuber says, game sucks means game sucks.
[115:57.09]I never said that, and I was just doing a little slide here for fun.
[116:01.46]I've never said the game sucks, did I?
[116:02.82]Have I said that?
[116:03.34]I don't think I have.
[116:07.10]I think my exact words were like, what the fuck?
[116:10.24]Like, what the heck?
[116:12.12]What the fuck?
[116:15.70]There is something down here that I want to do.
[116:16.92]Because I have the butt stomp now, right?
[116:23.02]I did?
[116:24.08]I said the game sucks?
[116:25.03]Did I?
[116:26.79]When did I say the game sucks?
[116:28.93]Can I retract that statement?
[116:30.67]Until, like, a further notice?
[116:35.97]Where's that weird machine over here?
[116:40.30]When I got hurt by the fire, I said the game sucks.
[116:41.94]Well, okay, that's fine.
[116:44.92]That's okay.
[116:46.56]That was just me being angry.
[116:48.37]Does this game suck?
[116:49.05]I don't know.
[116:51.53]It might.
[116:53.67]So, I can, like, butt-stomp this, right?
[116:56.65]Why did he get more bullets?
[117:01.95]20 seconds.
[117:02.24]Where's, like, the funny face one?
[117:03.80]Here.
[117:04.04]And then the foot.
[117:06.58]There's the foot.
[117:08.34]And then the cheeseburger.
[117:09.56]Cheeseburger.
[117:10.26]And then the selfie of the person.
[117:13.34]Where's the person selfie?
[117:14.88]Person selfie right here.
[117:20.69]That snake is my hair.
[117:22.95]You would hear me scream.
[117:25.68]Alright.
[117:28.34]We have five pages now.
[117:33.02]Like, can I get to a new world?
[117:34.66]Yep.
[117:34.97]Ooh, what's that?
[117:41.65]I'm going over there.
[117:42.77]I'm going that way.
[117:45.87]I'm assuming the first, like, new zone is five, right?
[117:49.41]Ooh, he's a sad face.
[117:52.29]And there's, like, a... Talk about, like, absolutely no depth perception.
[118:04.94]I couldn't even tell.
[118:07.64]There's no way for me to even know if I was going the right way.
[118:20.50]Depth perception.
[118:21.88]No, I don't want to go all the way up here again.
[118:25.93]I want to leave this place.
[118:27.05]I don't like this place.
[118:29.47]I need to find... I can go butt-snob something and we'll leave it.
[118:33.88]We're getting the fuck out of here.
[118:35.48]We're going to go to another world.
[118:37.26]Where's the exit over here?
[118:43.12]Over here.
[118:47.96]Depth perception, pal.
[118:49.06]Look into it.
[118:50.88]Just came back.
[118:51.34]How was the game?
[118:53.28]Eh.
[118:55.32]It's... Eh.
[118:58.78]It's... No, it's alright.
[118:59.46]It's... It's... No, it's okay.
[119:03.09]It's... This is... It's good.
[119:04.55]It's alright.
[119:07.91]It's not amazing me.
[119:09.01]It's not, like, super impressing me.
[119:10.53]But it's... Hmm?
[119:12.63]Hmm?
[119:15.19]You know?
[119:15.39]Hmm?
[119:18.43]It's a very solid, like, you know.
[119:25.03]I didn't say game sucks.
[119:25.89]What?
[119:26.07]I never said that.
[119:31.45]The audio's not yet at the ear.
[119:33.21]It's, yeah.
[119:34.63]Some of the sound design could be a little better, I think.
[119:37.45]Do I need to go down here for anything?
[119:38.98]It's probably like an underwater world, which I don't want to do that.
[119:43.96]Where was that spot where I think I could stomp on?
[119:46.00]Isn't there a little stomp thing I could do?
[119:50.15]There's fire here.
[119:55.01]And now if I can do this, what would I need to shoot?
[120:03.13]Should I shoot these?
[120:19.84]I wonder if I can do something with these.
[120:23.80]Can I, like, burn these into different letters?
[120:27.98]Oh, there we go.
[120:32.97]Oh, pagey.
[120:33.69]I get it.
[120:34.01]Alright, how do I put it out?
[120:37.73]How do I put that out?
[120:38.47]I think I have to do it all over again.
[120:45.17]Just get it wrong.
[120:51.06]No.
[120:51.74]I'm gonna stay in the middle here.
[120:52.62]Okay, what the hell?
[120:55.30]Like, does it want me to do it in order?
[120:57.52]Like, why?
[120:59.16]I wanna do it in order.
[121:02.22]P-A-G-E-P.
[121:03.12]Like, light this one.
[121:25.06]That's what I was trying to do for the whole thing, but it kept giving me fucking noise indicators.
[121:29.87]P-A-G, I just have to spell it.
[121:45.20]That joke was actually pretty good.
[121:54.90]Alright, let's keep going.
[121:58.75]I'm gonna go to the other area if there is one.
[122:00.57]Face bomb to the max.
[122:06.92]That's what I wanted to do at first, but then they were staying lit up.
[122:11.82]So I was like, maybe he just wants me to blow them all out like a fucking candle.
[122:14.33]Okay, I'm gonna go up.
[122:27.69]I tried it.
[122:34.68]I tried it.
[122:35.14]I tried it.
[122:35.74]I tried it.
[122:36.22]I tried it.
[122:41.42]Stomp this thing and maybe get to a new spot.
[122:43.31]That's it.
[122:47.13]I beat Family Guy.
[122:48.51]Family Guy.
[122:49.13]I beat Family Guy on stream.
[122:51.89]I beat Family Feud 1996.
[122:53.31]That is true.
[122:53.71]I beat that on stream.
[122:57.75]Capital B's office.
[122:58.86]Another cutscene.
[123:09.68]This game's driving me nuts and I'm not even paying attention anymore.
[123:23.51]Yeah, I beat the Family Guy video game last week.
[123:34.64]Despicable Bee.
[123:38.30]Yep.
[123:38.66]There he is.
[123:41.33]Maybe I should do more Spore.
[123:46.09]No!
[123:46.87]We are never playing Spore again.
[124:13.25]This voice is going to make me eat my own hair.
[124:15.29]It's nostalgia.
[124:17.83]It's going back to the old days.
[124:23.99]Today's children play iPad games.
[124:25.61]They wouldn't like this.
[124:39.07]Did I just hear Spore DLC fixes?
[124:41.24]I'm not gonna go buy the Spore DLC.
[124:45.68]You guys already saw the funny part of Spore.
[124:51.32]I missed that.
[124:53.92]Where's that?
[124:54.56]Give me a fucking acting job.
[124:56.55]I'll do it.
[125:20.73]Alright.
[125:23.19]This better not be a poison gas place.
[125:25.33]Welcome, welcome.
[125:28.22]I'm your host, Dr. Quack.
[125:30.24]Look, lately this must be capital B's, capital bullshit, more like it.
[125:34.14]Big Hench Manager.
[125:37.24]If big was your primary, this guy doesn't seem to fit the bill.
[125:40.08]I reckon he'd dare us pass if we lobbed him a few bread crumbs.
[125:46.11]Toilets, I see you've been trespassing illegally inside one of my scientific book worlds, and now you'll pay the penalty with the terrifying quickfire quiz!
[125:54.29]The what?
[125:56.52]You'll need to provide ten correct answers in order to survive my awful question assault!
[126:05.78]Answer a question correctly, and I'll speed the game up, because it just slowed down to a fucking crawl.
[126:11.77]But get one wrong, and you'll lose a life!
[126:16.10]This is level two, by the way.
[126:18.00]We slowed the fucking game down to a crawl.
[126:26.34]Now step forward and prepare for a trivia trouncil.
[126:35.64]The Knights of Hamlot, which one rides a pathetic horse?
[126:41.75]I don't know this person.
[126:45.49]It's the only person I haven't met.
[126:46.61]Come on, did you even pay attention before now?
[126:53.62]Apparently that wasn't right.
[126:55.62]How long has it taken you to get this far?
[126:58.56]Easy.
[127:00.38]Oh.
[127:01.42]Let me take... Hold on a second, guys.
[127:02.55]Let me just take a look at how long I've been streaming for.
[127:06.33]Two hours and seven minutes.
[127:08.57]So, excuse me.
[127:12.42]The picture, where was it taken?
[127:22.99]That's a shitty picture.
[127:28.31]That was in a... I don't fucking know.
[127:40.34]Why is this the second level?
[127:46.43]Is this the second level?
[127:52.59]Better luck next time.
[127:53.51]Back to the start, dummies.
[127:55.37]Hey, Borislav.
[127:58.83]Thank you, Borislav.
[128:00.78]For the $15, they say this is for the record.
[128:04.02]History is written by the victor.
[128:06.26]History is filled with liars.
[128:10.47]What is this like paragraph?
[128:13.72]What is this like, I don't even know what this paragraph is, but thank you for the $15 regardless.
[128:18.76]I don't know if that was, that's a wall of text.
[128:21.66]Much appreciated.
[128:23.82]Let's do it again.
[128:31.70]I got flawlessed, yeah.
[128:36.78]Four years ago, I hope you studied.
[128:38.34]No, I didn't study.
[128:43.77]That's from Modern Warfare 2?
[128:46.93]Where was this picture taken?
[128:47.79]This is like somebody dropped their camera.
[128:53.68]Okay, it's this one.
[128:55.80]No, incorrect.
[128:56.70]I thought you asked the audience.
[129:05.64]The tribal stack temple, who lives inside?
[129:08.32]The funny looking guy with the hat.
[129:11.62]I didn't, I got it.
[129:13.14]I pressed X to try to skip that last word of text and I got it right, thank God.
[129:19.88]Double curses, a super quick correct answer.
[129:22.80]That's a two pointer!
[129:30.67]Hey, it worked out.
[129:34.18]Pages?
[129:35.42]How many do you have in total?
[129:39.10]Six, right?
[129:39.68]What do you- what?
[129:46.10]What?
[129:46.72]I have six pages.
[129:47.66]I thought- don't you spend them?
[129:52.33]Trousers, bogus moves.
[129:53.71]Which did you purchase first?
[129:56.11]Oh, shit.
[129:56.57]I think it was the spit.
[129:59.76]He's clearly cheating now, yeah.
[130:07.74]Jerma's tripping over his dick so hard that he's winning.
[130:11.59]Chat said five.
[130:14.27]Oh no, not another picture.
[130:15.85]Where is this picture taken?
[130:19.64]How would I ever know this?
[130:20.78]The temple.
[130:24.06]Yeah, okay.
[130:30.31]Stupid.
[130:31.97]Alright, I just gotta answer two more correct.
[130:38.11]The ridiculous fishbowl freak Dr. Puzz, what is her first transformation?
[130:43.65]I don't know.
[130:46.49]A plant, a minibus, a T-Rex.
[130:48.19]I don't know.
[130:49.23]I have no idea.
[130:50.13]A plant.
[130:50.87]I got it.
[130:51.93]There's a 33% chance I was going to get that right.
[131:01.34]Tribal stack tropics.
[131:02.88]How many pages were required to unlock it?
[131:05.34]It's got to be like six, right?
[131:08.44]Seven, one.
[131:09.74]Wait, tribal, tribal, one.
[131:10.78]Yeah, that was the first level.
[131:16.30]Okay.
[131:19.04]So that's it.
[131:20.62]Do I win?
[131:21.12]Or do I need one more?
[131:22.66]Alright, last question.
[131:23.64]Get it right.
[131:25.06]Those ghastly ghost riders, which did you capture first in Tribal Staff?
[131:29.69]Okay, it was the, um... It was the red guy.
[131:32.39]Red.
[131:41.33]It wasn't the red guy?
[131:42.09]It was the green guy?
[131:43.61]I thought it was the red guy.
[131:45.13]It was yellow?
[131:46.31]No, it was the red guy.
[131:51.35]It was the fucking red guy.
[131:53.33]Oh my god.
[132:11.45]Why would I need to do this after the first level?
[132:17.30]Why is this in the game right now?
[132:19.58]Wasn't this in Banjo-Kazooie, like, the last fucking part of the game?
[132:24.56]Am I not supposed to be here?
[132:27.96]What does Rampo hate?
[132:30.16]I don't even know.
[132:30.86]I skipped that whole conversation.
[132:32.56]And I got it right.
[132:42.16]You're literally right there.
[132:43.04]Just take three steps, I know, really.
[132:46.00]Quills?
[132:47.48]How many do you have in total?
[132:51.24]It was like 70-something.
[132:52.04]Yeah, like 66.
[132:52.96]I couldn't buy.
[132:53.86]How do I...
[133:09.26]Another picture.
[133:09.90]Oh, okay.
[133:11.19]I don't ask.
[133:14.11]What was it?
[133:15.03]I don't remember.
[133:15.65]I don't remember because I don't, like, care.
[133:20.43]Can I just jump off into the fucking acid and do this again?
[133:24.81]Jump in the acid and do it again.
[133:31.37]That's the bone person.
[133:32.61]I don't, like, I don't fucking care.
[133:36.00]Who is this care?
[133:36.68]I don't even, I don't know.
[133:39.11]I don't fucking know who these people are.
[133:40.65]I don't have to do this, right?
[133:42.06]I pick the same one every time.
[133:46.20]Guys, why do I have to do this right now?
[133:48.36]This can't be the next place to go.
[134:05.64]If this is the next, like, logical place to go in the game, this is fucking terrible.
[134:13.36]If this is not the logical next place to go, then I don't care.
[134:16.28]But, like, this is like, let me just fucking play the gun.
[134:18.55]I don't want to, like, go study character names.
[134:22.73]To, like, get to level 2.
[134:26.11]I just want to go to level 2.
[134:28.41]I want to go to level 2.
[134:29.21]This isn't, like, level 13.
[134:34.34]Her first transformation is a fucking dumb plant.
[134:37.32]A plant.
[134:49.36]Are you mad right now?
[134:52.10]Yeah, I just wanna play.
[134:53.14]I don't wanna, like, do a fucking quiz on, like, character names and, like, upside-down pictures from a shitty tourist.
[135:05.99]One.
[135:09.03]The game is... This game is meant for 10-year-olds, not people that have finished Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[135:19.93]The picture, where is it taken?
[135:21.21]Why would I need to know this?
[135:24.01]Uh, it's inside the temple.
[135:27.43]The Duke's Temple.
[135:40.29]This can't be, like, this has to be a secret, right?
[135:43.81]Okay, which one of the knights rides a pathetic horse?
[135:46.79]I don't know.
[135:48.17]It isn't that person.
[135:50.75]Loots a lot.
[135:51.35]I don't know.
[135:52.07]I don't care.
[135:53.35]About any of this.
[135:55.49]I don't know.
[135:56.05]Just give me the ones I already know.
[136:01.93]Okay, I got this wrong last time.
[136:05.24]How many do I have?
[136:06.64]It's more than six.
[136:07.44]It has to be nine.
[136:10.90]Is it nine?
[136:11.52]I don't know.
[136:12.58]Which one is it?
[136:13.80]I don't know.
[136:14.22]Thank God.
[136:15.79]Zero.
[136:16.71]Fuck.
[136:33.80]I don't know.
[136:35.22]I don't know.
[136:36.08]Oh, it's Molecule.
[136:36.92]Okay, I do know.
[136:40.48]I do know.
[136:45.60]There's the final question.
[136:47.38]Please let me get it right.
[136:48.20]Ivory Tower's hard-working employees.
[136:52.97]Which did you cruelly defeat first?
[137:01.37]I don't fucking have any idea.
[137:03.87]Thank god.
[137:04.91]Oh my god.
[137:05.59]Thank you, Panderson.
[137:07.99]Panderson97.
[137:11.45]Just gave 9001 bits.
[137:14.68]Thank you, Panderson.
[137:15.92]He says, play Spore.
[137:32.33]$90.
[137:35.12]Thank you for the $9,000.
[137:37.92]Thank you so much.
[137:42.04]Is that what I get for completing this?
[137:44.53]Thank you, Panderson.
[137:45.67]Panderson also gave $420. $420.
[137:48.49]Hold on, wait.
[137:48.95]Panderson has been kiffing.
[137:51.29]Panderson's been giving, like, a shitload of random, like, 25 cent, 25 cent, 50 cent.
[137:55.07]Okay.
[137:57.19]So he's given, like, less than 50 cents, like, five or six times.
[138:01.81]And all of them say play spore.
[138:04.69]And I wasn't listening to that.
[138:05.99]Like, play spore.
[138:06.69]Dude drops, like, a hundred bucks and says play spore.
[138:13.47]Well, I appreciate your spore enthusiasm, Panderson, but I'm not going to play Spore.
[138:21.44]Thank you.
[138:25.74]Next quiz is another one of these.
[138:29.98]Okay.
[138:31.26]I just would like to get to level two.
[138:40.07]Play Spore, you coward.
[138:44.98]Jerma only raised the big money?
[138:46.52]That's not true.
[138:51.67]$90 wasted.
[138:52.91]Quiz 2.
[138:53.37]I would laugh my ass off if this was another quiz.
[138:57.09]Hey?
[138:58.55]Did his voice change?
[139:05.74]That sounded like his voice was different.
[139:07.20]Why is this here?
[139:32.01]I need to freeze anything?
[139:44.34]I can't see what people are saying about the camera though.
[139:46.00]I'm not a fan.
[139:47.52]I wish I could pull it back and tilt it.
[139:48.78]Alright, well give me some- give me a new item.
[140:01.45]Okay, you're teaching me a glide?
[140:05.25]Okay.
[140:06.15]I'm gonna glide the last thing.
[140:11.25]Okay, apparently I can.
[140:17.73]There's the glide.
[140:18.73]And that's the thing I have to open, okay.
[140:24.33]Snake check?
[140:24.89]Snake check, you're right.
[140:25.65]I don't see anything.
[140:29.47]Wow, I thought they could control their court underneath me.
[140:34.28]Fuck, man.
[140:34.92]How did he get in here?
[140:37.08]Every time I think about that shit, it just freaks me out.
[140:39.10]How did he get in?
[140:41.37]This is a totally closed off space.
[140:43.37]How did he get in here?
[140:45.25]It's really concerning.
[140:54.23]Game make somebody legit I am getting like I'm not gonna lie.
[141:05.67]I am getting a little just like my head kind of I'm getting a little nauseous a little Not to the point where I need to stop but to the point where I'm like slightly irritated Okay, this is a cool zone it's kind of cool Alright nice
[141:24.54]What's down here?
[141:25.38]A button?
[141:26.76]I don't know.
[141:30.66]What's the point of doing this?
[141:34.06]I can't see what that is.
[141:34.94]I don't think I can press that.
[141:38.00]I'm just gonna go up.
[141:41.84]Uh...
[141:55.10]Is it to drain the water or something?
[141:56.66]Where's the drain?
[142:12.43]Okay.
[142:15.86]That camera's not cool.
[142:16.98]I wish I could see what the hell was going on in there.
[142:22.44]I don't think I can do this yet.
[142:24.51]I don't think I can.
[142:26.59]I don't know.
[142:34.41]Might have to come back here later.
[142:35.54]I don't know.
[142:41.14]Let's leave.
[142:42.50]Play Spore or Bake Stay.
[142:47.53]Nope.
[142:50.87]No!
[142:51.31]No!
[142:51.71]No!
[142:52.09]No!

[143:00.80]Oh, this is gonna be video game land.
[143:03.04]This is gonna be cool.
[143:08.26]Arcade games?
[143:16.82]Okay.
[143:17.60]So I can play little arcade games?
[143:19.56]Sounds like a Banjo-Kazooie character.
[143:22.32]Alright.
[143:23.54]What is this one?
[143:26.20]Do friends want to play fun arcade games?
[143:29.62]Yes.
[143:50.75]Panderson gave 10 bucks.
[143:52.07]Please play Spore.
[143:53.09]No, I'm not going to play Spore.
[143:55.40]Captain Magic gave $5.
[143:56.50]Hey, Jimmer, long time YouTube viewer.
[143:59.42]First time stream watcher.
[144:00.26]Love your stuff.
[144:00.64]Well, hey, Captain Magic.
[144:01.40]Thank you for the $5.
[144:02.76]Hope you enjoy the stream.
[144:06.30]Thank you, Jimmer.
[144:08.30]Okay.
[144:11.28]Easy enough, right?
[144:15.08]Move around and shoot.
[144:17.18]It's gonna be retro.
[144:17.76]It's gonna be pixeled.
[144:19.76]I can't wait for a retro pixel.
[144:23.38]It's gonna be so awesome.
[144:25.44]It's not even pixelated.
[144:26.47]Oh, retro.
[144:27.65]Are you shitting me?
[144:29.43]What the fuck is this?
[144:34.37]You're gonna have, like, pixelated retro music, but this is not gonna be, like, SNES style?
[144:39.63]Ooh, somebody ran out of money!
[144:42.32]Somebody ran out of money!
[144:50.57]needs more money I like it oh shit don't get hit by the fucking
[145:26.52]Alright, so... How long does this last?
[145:36.49]Missed two.
[145:38.45]Missed more than two.
[145:39.23]This is better than Doom.
[145:49.94]You bet your ass it is.
[146:03.91]Alright, I'm kind of done with this.
[146:07.09]Kind of done.
[146:09.03]I guess, like, grenade shot?
[146:14.63]How is this a grenade shot?
[146:15.55]It wouldn't do anything.
[146:17.43]I barely did any splash damage at all.
[146:19.32]Did I make it to the end? 9,500?
[146:33.22]I think I win.
[146:33.70]Do I get a puzzle piece?
[146:35.68]Is that the only game he has in his whole arcade?
[146:44.49]Those are all donors, by the way.
[146:54.35]No, this one's new.
[146:55.81]Collect quills, avoid the traps, grab the power.
[146:57.63]Get me out.
[146:59.15]Get me out of here.
[146:59.73]No.
[147:00.29]Get me out.
[147:02.35]Nope.
[147:03.07]I'm done.
[147:03.49]I'm not, I don't want to do that.
[147:06.16]I don't want to do that.
[147:13.34]Um.
[147:14.40]What is this?
[147:17.40]Is this the same one?
[147:18.70]This one doesn't need to be on.
[147:24.45]Okay, there's only two.
[147:26.01]Is this one?
[147:27.29]Wait, hold on.
[147:28.81]Is this one?
[147:29.77]No, I don't want to do it.
[147:33.34]I don't want to do that.
[147:35.08]So where the hell am I supposed to go now?
[147:36.32]Do I have to, like, unlock the next place or something?
[147:40.71]I would assume.
[147:42.93]Maybe?
[147:45.77]Over this way?
[147:46.95]I don't know.
[147:49.89]I guess.
[147:50.65]I tried to glide.
[147:53.17]Didn't work.
[147:57.24]Everyone's begging you to play Spore.
[147:59.94]Were you guys here when I played Spore last time?
[148:04.88]I almost died playing that game.
[148:09.23]What the heck is going on here?
[148:15.85]I'm getting a little sick of doing this.
[148:28.11]Let's get to the next level.
[148:28.89]I want to see the next level.
[148:29.75]I want to see Elisa the next place.
[148:36.02]Cannonballs?
[148:38.77]Why is this blinking like this?
[148:48.55]Snow level?
[148:52.60]God damn stupid roll controls.
[148:55.54]Refund the game live on stream, it's too late.
[149:00.55]No, I didn't even come in this way.
[149:01.83]What the hell?
[149:10.27]I don't even, like... Like, I don't even remember where that was.
[149:34.19]Show me your credit score?
[149:35.23]Why do you want to know my credit score?
[149:40.27]Hey, news flash.
[149:41.91]It ain't good.
[149:45.15]It's like 240.
[149:48.65]I am in real trouble, guys.
[149:50.98]I have a 208 credit score.
[149:56.14]I'm kidding.
[149:59.14]Should I shoot this thing?
[150:01.92]Shoot the beehive?
[150:04.44]I don't know.
[150:09.61]Hey, look, found it.
[150:11.19]How much does it cost?
[150:13.55]Five.
[150:14.07]You need three pages to unlock this world.
[150:15.75]Do you want to unlock Glitter Glaze Glacier?
[150:18.31]Yes.
[150:26.99]Not even a 780.
[150:27.51]Whoa.
[150:27.67]Whoa.
[150:39.01]Okay, let's do it.
[150:41.13]Let's see the actual new level.
[150:45.84]Every time I swear, my credit drops a point.
[150:48.18]That'd be terrible.
[150:54.42]This has to be the most annoying hub world in existence.
[150:58.96]Yeah, it kind of sucks, doesn't it?
[151:02.10]The hub world, it really spills all over the place.
[151:06.26]I feel like they made that place last.
[151:08.30]And it was kind of like, eh, better get it done.
[151:14.08]This place is pretty, though.
[151:18.43]It's cute.
[151:21.63]You know, this place is cute.
[151:22.69]I like it.
[151:23.11]It's cute.
[151:25.83]That's what I'll say every time.
[151:29.04]Wow, this place is fucking cute.
[151:32.56]I guess I can't get up there.
[151:37.94]Let's-a go!
[151:38.46]I feel like that water is icy and it'll hurt me.
[151:52.57]The guy with the Mario hat on is harder to kill.
[152:01.30]There's the fridge lady.
[152:03.88]I do not want to swap my taunt until I keep that one on.
[152:08.53]Why do I sound like a squeaky toy?
[152:09.55]I don't know.
[152:10.69]Let's see.
[152:12.95]I guess I do.
[152:14.65]Watch out for the paint.
[152:15.63]Alright, let's go up.
[152:20.48]And see if we can find a piece.
[152:23.78]What did I need?
[152:24.20]Like five?
[152:27.14]This place looks a lot more expansive than the last one.
[152:31.47]Didn't you guys tell me that the first, like, the first zone was the best zone?
[152:35.07]Is that true?
[152:36.49]Ow, what the fuck?
[152:40.51]Now I'm deaf.
[152:43.36]The music's too loud.
[152:44.22]Take a look at where it is.
[152:45.50]This shit is as low as it can go, otherwise it has to be off.
[152:50.66]Wait, look at this.
[152:52.37]So let's break this down for a second here.
[152:54.67]Keep in mind, this is off.
[152:57.27]This is as low as the fucking volume will possibly go.
[153:02.50]Wanna see what happens if I do it one more time?
[153:06.18]Now it's like unbearable.
[153:09.78]It's, uh... It's real solid.
[153:11.76]It's real solid.
[153:16.28]I mean, I could go into the, uh... I could go into the mixer and turn it down.
[153:23.27]Max?
[153:23.55]I'm not gonna put it on Max!
[153:25.71]So I can't go over this way unless I get, like, boots.
[153:27.77]It's cold in here.
[153:30.53]I think we need to warm up.
[153:32.96]Just don't touch it.
[153:37.06]I guess this is... Do I need to light this somehow?
[153:42.36]I need to, like, breathe fire at this, don't I?
[153:47.60]Huh.
[153:48.60]What?
[153:48.84]What?
[153:52.08]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[153:53.26]I'm dead.
[153:54.10]Why am I not getting hurt now?
[154:01.20]Um, okay.
[154:06.71]Where's, like, a flame flower?
[154:07.75]Shouldn't there be, like, a flame flower if they want me to do that?
[154:11.49]Just gotta go fast, apparently.
[154:12.51]I can't go that fast, by the way.
[154:21.33]This is ice, and it's really slippery.
[154:24.87]No, that ain't helping.
[154:27.41]Oh, you guys aren't telling me to go max speed, you're telling me to do max volume.
[154:30.96]Oh my fucking god, it's over.
[154:33.28]I'm dead.
[154:37.38]Max, turn it up.
[154:38.52]No, I'm not gonna turn the volume up.
[154:50.25]Like upstairs here?
[154:50.99]Like upstairs?
[154:52.39]Ah, whatever.
[155:01.85]I wasn't moving.
[155:03.51]I actually do need to pee though.
[155:05.86]Alright, well, while we think about how I need to do this, I'm gonna go pee.
[155:11.22]I do need to pee.
[155:12.34]And there's my screen, so you can go like this.
[155:14.38]It's cool.
[155:16.37]Alright, I'll be right back.
[155:17.75]Pee time.
[156:51.75]Wait, what?
[159:18.61]Alright.
[159:19.91]Yeah, my beer at back screen is, uh, not on my fucking, the right folder, so I'm an idiot.
[159:24.84]So don't worry, we're fine.
[159:28.00]Oh, well, I forgot to do the joke.
[159:29.78]Oh, well.
[159:31.98]I was gonna do a joke there where I had, like, a bunch of, like, embarrassing folder names and embarrassing files and shit, then I'm gonna be like, oh, no, whoa, how'd you see that?
[159:41.35]I didn't do it fast enough.
[159:42.75]I thought I turned my webcam on, and I was like, well, there goes my Twitch account.
[159:46.62]I thought I had, instead of monitor capture, I looked over, I thought it was video capture.
[159:50.24]And I was about to lose my entire Twitch account.
[159:52.68]Because I'm fucking naked.
[159:56.18]Oh well.
[159:58.47]Let's go.
[160:04.91]I'm only eating one handful of cheeses.
[160:06.69]That's it.
[160:07.13]No more food.
[160:08.97]I promise.
[160:20.02]Can I even do this shit?
[160:41.69]Okay, so let's take this a little slower.
[160:45.27]And hold on, I need to... Give me a second, like this is fucking ridiculous.
[160:52.48]Yeah.
[160:53.80]When, when are companies gonna learn?
[160:57.00]Guys, if I ever have a video game company, please let me learn.
[161:00.56]Tell me to learn.
[161:02.80]To have my master volume on my video game be like 50% lower than what it needs to be.
[161:17.97]I lied.
[161:18.73]I'm sorry, I lied.
[161:21.57]I ate another, like, handful of cheeses.
[161:23.25]I'm so sorry.
[161:24.33]I had to.
[161:26.75]I had to.
[161:27.29]It was so good.
[161:28.93]I had to do it.
[161:30.50]Snake Man.
[161:32.60]You gonna give me, like, fire boots?
[161:35.24]Oh, come on.
[161:50.87]Do it louder?
[161:51.61]Oh, now I can go in there and do it a little louder.
[161:53.60]Snake check.
[161:54.42]When I came in the room, I didn't see him.
[161:55.52]I looked for him, for sure.
[161:59.34]No, guys, I think he's just gone.
[162:02.40]He's gonna have, like, an entire snake family in my walls.
[162:08.73]Lizard leap.
[162:12.87]I don't know which one of these I even need.
[162:14.35]Slurp state?
[162:16.47]Absorb the powers of gobbled items?
[162:21.01]I don't know.
[162:24.17]Hey, thank you, Panderson, for the six bucks.
[162:26.99]They say cheer-y.
[162:28.67]They say... No, they spelled spore.
[162:34.06]Thank you for the six bucks, dude.
[162:36.64]He's gonna keep doing that.
[162:43.96]I'm gonna go with Lizard Leap.
[162:47.18]I feel like Lizard Leap's a good idea.
[162:49.98]Let's go with Leap.
[162:53.23]I lied again, I'm sorry.
[162:54.03]He's another handful of cheeses.
[163:04.76]I'm seriously considering leaving so I can get some Cheez-Its.
[163:07.06]I wouldn't blame you.
[163:09.76]Like, let's... Absolute.
[163:12.35]Without any question.
[163:13.99]Let's be real on the stream.
[163:16.05]Real.
[163:17.25]Cheez-Its.
[163:18.61]Doesn't matter what flavor you're talking about.
[163:20.13]Doesn't matter if these are a box of like the regular classic cheddar cheese flavored Cheez-Its.
[163:27.20]Doesn't matter if you're talking about potentially Cheez-Its, Duos, Jalapeño, and Cheddar Jack combined.
[163:32.90]They have the combined boxes now.
[163:34.22]Fantastic.
[163:35.14]Absolutely 10 out of 10, I would say.
[163:37.08]Or if you're talking about, or if you're daring, or if you're a little bit edgy and you go for the toasted Cheez-Its.
[163:41.86]Doesn't matter which one you eat, they're all going to be delicious.
[163:45.62]Cheez-Its.
[163:47.21]Check them out.
[164:01.01]Hot Cheez-Its.
[164:01.83]Tabasco Cheez-Its.
[164:02.69]Oh, yeah, they're great.
[164:06.74]I don't care what anybody says.
[164:08.40]And don't give me this cheese, the knock-off ones.
[164:12.34]Like Cheese Nips and like Cheese Curl.
[164:16.14]No, no, no, no.
[164:17.43]I'm going to give you the knock-off company and then here we go.
[164:20.81]This is important to me.
[164:22.39]How do I do it?
[164:23.03]Where is it?
[164:24.85]Hold on.
[164:25.07]Let's look it up.
[164:33.87]Look at this shit.
[164:35.57]No way.
[164:37.55]Let's bring it over here.
[164:40.61]Oh, Kraft cheese nips.
[164:43.33]You know what I mean?
[164:44.47]Like, get the fuck out of here.
[164:46.45]You guys ever seen these before?
[164:52.07]No.
[164:53.15]Don't buy these.
[164:54.35]You got the original.
[165:00.89]Let's go.
[165:04.56]I've eaten them before.
[165:05.10]They taste like dirty cardboard.
[165:07.36]Cheese nips are so much better.
[165:08.86]Oh, wow.
[165:11.12]Wow.
[165:13.62]What the hell did you just say to me?
[165:19.15]I'm about to craft?
[165:20.43]You guys want to talk about a company like craft?
[165:22.71]Cheese ain't even real.
[165:23.85]They don't even use real cheese like cheese it does.
[165:27.47]Cheese says it right on the box.
[165:29.01]Made with 100% real cheese.
[165:30.93]And guess what?
[165:31.43]Cheese Nips is made with Kraft cheese.
[165:33.17]That ain't even real cheese.
[165:34.43]Alright, how do I do the super jump?
[165:53.22]Like that, okay.
[165:57.83]Craft cheese is people.
[165:59.03]Alright, hold on.
[166:01.96]Let's go that way.
[166:09.10]Craft cheese is real cheese.
[166:10.12]No it ain't.
[166:12.08]It's fucking like... Crappy, like, processed, not real cheese.
[166:16.00]You know what's in this one?
[166:17.28]I'll read you the ingredients.
[166:18.98]I'm gonna read you the... I'm gonna read you the Cheez-Its ingredients box.
[166:23.29]Here we go.
[166:23.99]Look at all these fucking natural, organic, 100% real ingredients.
[166:29.69]You guys ready to hear this shit?
[166:32.11]Ingredients.
[166:32.57]I'm going to prove you fucking idiots wrong.
[166:34.99]That these are like the natural great alternative.
[166:37.57]All the fucking natural flavor.
[166:39.73]Enriched wheat flour.
[166:42.13]Vitamin B2.
[166:42.75]We've got vitamins in there.
[166:43.99]Vegetable oil.
[166:45.69]Cheese made with skim milk.
[166:48.40]cheese protein, cheese cultures, salt enzymes, annatto extract color, that's a natural ingredient, cheddar cheese, contains 2% less of salt, maltodextrin, paprika, maltodextrin is just a softening agent, that's a natural ingredient, paprika, whey, buttermilk, jalapeño pepper,
[167:09.42]Monosodium glutamate.
[167:10.78]MSG.
[167:11.12]That's a little bit of MSG.
[167:12.55]It's alright.
[167:13.11]Sometimes there's MSGs and stuff.
[167:15.13]You can, like, brush it off with your hand.
[167:17.29]Yeast, tomato powder, garlic powder, parsley, baking soda, natural and artificial flavors, onion powder.
[167:23.35]They grind up onions and put it in here.
[167:25.49]Corn syrup solids, annatto extract again, but twice, to make sure it's extra color-y.
[167:30.92]Disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, paprika oil of some color, sodium caseinate, olealyzed yeast extract, malic acid,
[167:39.00]Sugar, spice, turmeric, oils in color, modified cornstarch, and this, okay, this ain't real.
[167:45.48]It might not be real, but it's fucking good.
[167:47.96]And those are all, like, natural ingredients.
[167:53.05]What's on the back of it?
[167:53.83]Like, the cheese nips box.
[167:55.15]Probably poison.
[167:57.17]Yeah, that's fine.
[167:59.93]You can talk shit about cheese that's on the ingredients box.
[168:02.39]Look at the ingredients box for cheese nips.
[168:04.59]You know what number three is?
[168:06.33]Poison.
[168:07.09]It says P-O-I-S-O-N.
[168:09.61]I don't want to get sued.
[168:10.65]It doesn't say that.
[168:11.90]It doesn't say poison.
[168:16.78]That was a joke.
[168:17.42]Hey, Kraft, that was a joke.
[168:19.74]I know that I was just making a joke.
[168:21.52]I know that's not in there.
[168:22.48]There's enough poison.
[168:24.94]And I think I did this wrong.
[168:29.69]I only have four seconds to do this.
[168:32.07]We're gonna have to do it again.
[168:33.67]That's okay.
[168:37.25]Number one ingredient, snakes.
[168:38.45]It's not even made out of cheese.
[168:40.33]It's not even made out of crackers.
[168:41.43]It's made out of snakes.
[168:43.82]Poison.
[168:49.96]Oh, God.
[168:51.02]You're getting in fucking trouble.
[168:53.16]Alright, where's the next one?
[168:57.66]What?
[168:58.72]What?
[169:00.50]What?
[169:02.78]What?
[169:03.68]How the f- Oh, I didn't even know it was up there.
[169:08.14]How was I even supposed to see that?
[169:09.28]Come on, get there quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[169:13.46]I got, like, plenty of time.
[169:16.76]Shit!
[169:17.90]Oh my god, like, fucking god.
[169:23.08]Can we just talk about, like, cheeses for the next, like, two fucking hours?
[169:32.53]What is this Superman nonsense?
[169:38.77]Streamer doesn't read these, so he won't know I'm in a gorilla suit.
[169:41.75]I do read them.
[169:44.37]Hey, told you.
[169:45.31]I have to, like, wait for it to come back down.
[169:52.17]Come on, hurry up.
[169:58.26]And we gotta do a super jump, right?
[170:08.23]Oh, this sucks.
[170:09.79]Oh, thank God.
[170:14.19]Sir Jim... Sir Jimmy Jammer, thank you for the 10 bucks, they say.
[170:17.19]Yes, hello, this is Gilbert McRoyland with the Kraft Family Company.
[170:20.76]We'll be in touch with your lawyers.
[170:24.00]Like, I'm gonna be real.
[170:25.68]If I ever got sued by Kraft because of that and I had to go to court, don't you guys think that would be fucking hilarious?
[170:31.27]Wouldn't, like, people... Wouldn't, like, the internet think that was funny?
[170:34.56]You guys would.
[170:35.08]Like, the internet would think that was funny.
[170:37.34]Guy says a craft has poison in it and gets sued on stream, like, as a joke.
[170:45.76]That would not be good, actually.
[170:46.84]That would suck.
[170:51.96]Guy jokingly says that he thinks there's poison in cheese nips.
[170:56.65]Goes to jail.
[171:01.25]Eat Cheez-Its during the hearing.
[171:02.67]Where the hell can I even go now if I can't go over here?
[171:09.26]I guess I could keep going that way, can't I?
[171:23.06]Yeah, I'll go that way.
[171:24.26]I'm going to go to Elsa's castle.
[171:30.67]Let's go take a visit to Elsa.
[171:37.82]Jerma is mad.
[171:38.50]Part 7 bankruptcy.
[171:39.66]This is a new spot.
[171:48.68]Mmm.
[171:49.10]These are good cheeses.
[171:51.82]These are great cheeses.
[171:53.06]Definitely no poison in here.
[172:03.02]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[172:09.44]Man, I gotta assume I have to light these up.
[172:13.12]Where's the... flower or something?
[172:15.50]Oh, there it is.
[172:20.11]There it is!
[172:21.75]Snowman, do you talk?
[172:22.45]No, you just die.
[172:26.83]Alright, well, is this what I have to do?
[172:32.83]No.
[172:35.07]That's not doing anything.
[172:35.91]I can't activate these.
[172:36.67]I have to activate... I do it somehow.
[172:38.07]It's okay.
[172:41.25]I think I need to get a different ability.
[172:42.89]That's fine.
[172:46.04]Okay, here's this.
[172:49.50]This is my favorite character so far.
[172:55.04]Hat that was on my head flew away.
[172:56.54]Okay.
[172:56.76]Okay.
[173:07.80]This is so expensive.
[173:14.22]Yeah, I mean, I'm not necessarily hungry, but remember, these are Cheez-Its.
[173:17.95]So, they're just perfect snack.
[173:20.55]Absolutely perfect snack to eat.
[173:23.85]The Cheez-It Company.
[173:30.58]Everything they do is so good.
[173:35.00]Like, everything they make.
[173:35.70]You can't beat them.
[173:38.47]If you can't beat them, join them.
[173:49.69]They are good.
[173:50.63]Let's go up here.
[174:01.88]A moving, mean, angry sign.
[174:05.18]Finally, here.
[174:05.66]Hurry up and get to the work.
[174:07.42]Or plankers firewood, for sure.
[174:17.17]Shut a goth, girl.
[174:18.09]Alright, I'm not going to eat anymore.
[174:28.66]I'm sorry.
[174:29.36]I'm done.
[174:38.64]Okay.
[174:43.35]So I have to go... I don't think I have the right ability for this.
[174:47.23]Was Laylee just about to be angry that I don't have the ability for this?
[174:50.83]What do they want me to do?
[174:56.81]Get up here and smash shit?
[174:59.11]I have no idea.
[175:07.95]Can I, like, drag you guys?
[175:09.45]You're not going to do that shit to me right now.
[175:13.27]Not right now.
[175:13.69]Alright.
[175:14.05]Come over here.
[175:14.41]Maybe I can blow them up with the... Come on.
[175:20.10]Get over here.
[175:22.42]I didn't... I didn't... Because, like, I...
[175:33.08]I'm just so sick of running into all the random characters that take, like, five minutes to tell you what it is you're supposed to be doing.
[175:41.40]Ooh, treasure.
[175:42.40]That took way too long to happen, but it's okay.
[175:49.31]Oh, they're not even real treasure chests.
[175:55.71]Do a Cheez-It scream?
[175:57.03]I'm gonna die.
[175:57.73]I'm gonna lose.
[176:06.01]Just let Planker die.
[176:07.35]No one cares.
[176:14.51]Get up there.
[176:15.07]Would I trade 10% of my male area for 100,000 cheeses?
[176:20.82]No.
[176:21.02]100,000 cheeses is not that much.
[176:36.70]I'm talking about, like, 10% of my... What is that?
[184:36.08]Alright, we gotta expand this world.
[184:37.46]I feel like there's a lot of things I should be able to do that I can't do right now.
[184:45.78]I can't really go up there.
[184:47.94]I can't go up here.
[184:50.72]Alright.
[184:56.57]I'm supposed to use sonar.
[184:57.57]I don't have it.
[184:58.67]I don't have sonar.
[185:00.45]I need to buy it.
[185:05.17]Let's see if I can expand this world.
[185:06.27]Apparently the ice world is the worst world, really.
[185:28.07]Hmm.
[185:29.65]No enough pages, what?
[185:32.75]How much does it need?
[185:37.65]Alright, whatever.
[185:38.19]Apparently I can't do it yet.
[185:40.94]All the worlds are the worst world?
[185:42.54]Really?
[185:47.16]Yeah, at this point we're kind of leaning towards Do Not Recommend.
[185:53.96]Leaning that way.
[185:57.71]This game gets a Do Not Recommend.
[186:01.95]It gets a Recommend.
[186:03.33]It gets a very slight, slight Recommend.
[186:07.01]If.
[186:07.47]And only if.
[186:09.53]I can go back here.
[186:10.07]I can jump up the snow.
[186:12.37]If and only if you are a big, huge fan of the genre.
[186:16.73]Don't buy this game if you're not.
[186:18.19]There you go.
[186:19.61]Do not recommend unless you are a big fan of the genre.
[186:25.52]Is it a bad game?
[186:26.16]No.
[186:27.08]It's just a do not recommend game.
[186:33.98]But it's new.
[186:36.95]And, of course, if it's new, we gotta check it out, don't we?
[186:41.65]What was the point of all that?
[186:42.71]Well, there's like a weird flower over there.
[186:46.73]I don't... I don't think I was supposed to be able to do that.
[186:49.42]I got, like, lightning.
[186:51.58]We found one of us power extenders!
[186:54.32]We'll make your power bar bigger!
[186:56.76]We will!
[186:59.48]Okay.
[187:00.24]That's a little secret.
[187:04.71]That's it, huh?
[187:08.86]So it's a good game, but not recommended.
[187:10.92]It's just not recommended.
[187:13.98]I need to go buy the other thing.
[187:23.40]Okay, we leave.
[187:24.08]Goodbye.
[187:32.67]How's your financial situation?
[187:34.09]How's your sex life?
[187:36.07]What are these questions you guys are asking?
[187:39.12]Alright, let's try to get into Elsa's castle and then we're gonna call it a day and this is on before I can try to find a good place.
[187:45.17]Alright, so I want to go this way.
[187:52.25]Let's try to get into Elsa's castle.
[187:54.51]You know.
[187:57.66]Let's try.
[188:00.96]Haven't really explored over here either.
[188:02.82]No, I did.
[188:06.14]This way.
[188:09.33]Yooka-Laylee.
[188:15.12]So, I want to go that way, right?
[188:17.28]Yeah.
[188:21.06]What is that?
[188:21.66]There's another snowman person over there.
[188:24.73]Let's go up here first.
[188:37.10]That guy, I haven't... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[188:40.16]What is that?
[188:40.84]What is this?
[188:42.14]What is that?
[188:44.14]I'm rolling on my bum.
[188:46.50]Why can I not go over that?
[188:47.50]I'm doing a butt roll.
[188:49.52]I can't go up that.
[188:52.22]Even while rolling on my butt.
[188:56.38]Why is that?
[188:58.00]I thought I could roll up any uphill surface like that.
[188:59.82]Apparently not.
[189:06.45]This guy's got a championship belt on.
[189:13.83]So two people have the same hat.
[189:16.66]Okay.
[189:20.36]Uh, whatever.
[189:20.86]Ice, you just can't do it on ice.
[189:27.83]Whatever.
[189:29.15]Whatever.
[189:32.19]What is going on here?
[189:37.33]Okay Didn't work I guess it's got to be over there, right?
[190:07.19]Uh come back over here Uh, I don't know The hunter says three, let's just glitch the fuck out of this and climb up there Yeah
[190:39.08]Uh, so, what, what?
[190:41.70]Where's one and two?
[190:42.58]Where's one?
[190:43.56]What the fuck is this?
[190:51.71]I feel like... Where's one?
[191:08.42]Are you sure it comes out of nowhere or something?
[191:10.05]I don't know.
[191:16.33]This is some other way I can make this move.
[191:30.04]Three, two... I gotta wait till it gets right there.
[191:40.31]Close enough.
[191:41.47]There's one.
[191:42.01]There it is.
[191:43.87]So... What the hell?
[191:56.38]That's it?
[191:58.02]That's what you do?
[191:58.74]That's it.
[192:03.40]And why am I down here?
[192:04.26]Alright.
[192:11.59]I guess I did it.
[192:17.90]Got the piece.
[192:20.54]What do I get for thread count?
[192:23.04]Uh, you get 500 to go home.
[192:25.18]My opinion.
[192:28.01]500 or get the hell out of here.
[192:33.77]Get programmed.
[192:41.64]I feel like I've gotten all the ones I can get.
[192:48.76]Time surplus has returned.
[192:51.36]He's still here.
[192:52.18]I just don't know where.
[192:54.86]And it's scary, because he could just come out at any moment.
[192:58.70]Look, dude, how long do snakes live?
[193:02.20]Anybody know?
[193:04.04]What is the standard life of a snake?
[193:07.04]A small snake, like a garden snake.
[193:09.22]How long do they live?
[193:12.98]Because how long they live is how long he's going to live in this house.
[193:17.50]Okay, can't do that.
[193:22.17]50 years?
[193:22.55]No, that's not true.
[193:23.23]50 fucking years?
[193:27.03]So is the snake thing a true story or a joke?
[193:28.87]Etalyx, go look at my Twitter.
[193:31.28]Before I started the stream, a fucking just snake was just in the middle of this room, just like hanging out.
[193:35.68]It made no sense.
[193:37.39]And then I tried to get him out of here.
[193:38.69]I tried to like get him in like a car, like a little cardboard shoe box.
[193:41.93]And he like, he like slithered away and went into my wall.
[193:44.97]And he's gone.
[193:47.53]Seven to ten years.
[193:49.27]Okay.
[193:52.00]So you're telling me that this snake might live in my house for seven more years.
[194:02.11]Oh, God.
[194:04.53]I want to go up there, but I can't.
[194:06.94]So what else can I even do here?
[194:13.72]I think I'm out of options, guys.
[194:14.90]I might have to figure out what the hell to do next here.
[194:27.68]Oh, he's not stuck in the wall.
[194:28.86]He, like, went into the wall.
[194:30.28]He had an escape route.
[194:31.10]He knew what the hell he was doing.
[194:33.18]This wasn't a stupid snake.
[194:34.14]He knew exactly where he was going.
[194:38.20]Ow.
[194:40.44]This wasn't, oh no, I don't know where to go.
[194:42.84]This was, hey, this is where I came in the house.
[194:46.94]My escape route.
[194:51.70]You get rattlesnakes in California?
[194:53.26]Oh, I don't care.
[194:54.12]I'm not like a, I'm not afraid of a snake.
[194:57.38]It was just weird.
[194:58.02]It was just really odd to see just a fucking snake in my house.
[195:03.40]It's like, why?
[195:04.12]What?
[195:06.80]Let's buy the other thing and do this.
[195:08.68]Sonar shot is the only thing I get.
[195:13.87]Sonar shot.
[195:18.67]Yes.
[195:23.17]I'm not afraid of snakes.
[195:24.19]What?
[195:25.11]Snakes are like... Garden snakes are like harmless.
[195:34.79]I don't want to get bit though.
[195:43.56]It might be poisonous.
[195:46.68]This snake in my house might be poisonous.
[195:51.92]You know?
[195:53.53]What's the number two ingredient in a snake?
[195:56.29]Poison.
[195:58.31]Right?
[195:59.85]It's like enriched wheat flour, cheddar cheese, poison.
[196:05.33]That's how you make a snake.
[196:11.54]What color was it?
[196:20.97]It was black?
[196:22.94]It was a black snake with a yellow line across the, like, bottom of his neck.
[196:27.52]And that was it.
[196:28.38]He had a yellow stripe on his neck, and he was a black snake.
[196:32.39]Is he poisonous?
[196:37.07]If he bites me, am I gonna die?
[196:39.77]Like, should I, if I see him again, should I just grab him?
[196:41.85]Or if he bites me, am I going to die?
[196:44.14]He's got a yellow stripe on his neck.
[196:45.48]That means poison.
[196:46.56]That's a fucking cheese nip stripe.
[196:48.97]He's got a Kraft cheese or yellow cheese nips fucking slice on the back of his neck.
[196:53.58]I swear to God it was yellow.
[197:05.27]That's the black widow of snakes.
[197:14.83]Oh, that's funny.
[197:16.79]That's funny.
[197:19.23]It's a garter snake.
[197:21.68]Wait a minute.
[197:22.12]I thought it was a garden snake.
[197:23.94]Alright.
[197:28.26]Let's go do that.
[197:31.66]Snake guy here, you're fine.
[197:32.68]That's just a normal snake.
[197:33.53]Alright.
[197:34.13]Nice.
[197:34.91]I'm alright with that.
[197:38.01]Let's go back in the cave now.
[197:41.98]You are going to die.
[197:43.26]I thought it was a gardener snake.
[197:45.71]Like a garden snake.
[197:51.53]Garter snake?
[197:52.39]I thought it was a garden snake.
[197:57.58]Wait a minute.
[198:10.17]That is not what it looks like.
[198:12.11]I thought it was a gardener snake.
[198:13.87]See, I was right.
[198:18.54]That's not what it looks like.
[198:20.12]He didn't look like that.
[198:21.48]He didn't look like that either.
[198:25.31]He didn't look like any of these.
[198:33.07]He kind of looked... No, he didn't look like that.
[198:34.55]He was a solid... I swear to God, solid black snake with one yellow stripe on his neck.
[198:41.91]He didn't have any of these designs or anything.
[198:47.57]Yeah, it's... Hold on.
[198:48.35]I'm going to type in, like, black snake, yellow stripe on neck.
[198:56.02]Let's see what it says.
[198:59.06]Uh-oh.
[199:01.48]There he is.
[199:08.85]This makes me look like such a wuss.
[199:12.94]There he is.
[199:13.68]No, he was bigger than this.
[199:15.08]He was much bigger than this, I promise.
[199:18.08]He was not that small.
[199:22.44]And how about some mountains that generally has a complete neck ring and unpatterned underside.
[199:25.84]The southern ringneck is found in the coastal plain and often has a broken neck ring.
[199:33.47]He's not that small.
[199:34.47]He was much... I swear to God.
[199:36.51]Go look at the Twitter video.
[199:37.57]He was way bigger than that.
[199:38.73]Okay, are ringneck snakes poisonous?
[199:44.19]Oh, no.
[199:46.36]This is the first time I've ever had any kind of reaction to a ringneck bite.
[199:49.52]Granted, this snake rarely bites, and it's only the third one to do so.
[199:52.36]Ringnecks are not classified as venomous, but it has recently been observed that their saliva does contain a mild toxin.
[200:01.50]So you guys, what are you talking about?
[200:02.74]If it's going to bite me, I'm going to turn into fucking venom.
[200:07.44]That's exactly what he looked like, though.
[200:08.86]But he was much bigger.
[200:09.79]He wasn't that small.
[200:13.16]God.
[200:14.98]He's only slightly dangerous.
[200:17.30]Just don't let him bite me.
[200:21.14]Just don't get bit by the snake, and you'll be fine.
[200:27.42]Guys, it looks big to Jerma, okay?
[200:30.80]Well, thank you, Aronorth, for the $50.
[200:33.62]It did look... Go look at the Twitter video.
[200:37.14]It's, like, big.
[200:37.99]It's a big snake.
[200:41.89]Holy moly, stop crying.
[200:43.09]If it's a tiny fucking snake and too afraid to bite you.
[200:46.66]Who said I was crying?
[200:50.82]He's a scary snake.
[200:53.50]Alright, which one?
[200:55.20]Middle, front, back, left, right, left, right.
[200:57.34]Middle, front, back, left, right, left, right.
[200:59.75]Middle.
[201:01.99]Front, back.
[201:04.29]Left, right.
[201:06.77]Left, right.
[201:10.11]I bet you guys wouldn't fucking do
[201:21.84]Do you think I have enough of these to do something?
[201:24.88]In the video, it looks tiny.
[201:28.82]It's not tiny.
[201:29.72]That snake, in that video, that snake is about 12 to 14, probably 14 inches long.
[201:35.66]Maybe like 15 inches long.
[201:41.60]Post a link to the Twitter video.
[201:42.68]I think somebody just did.
[201:48.68]Crater puzzle, first try.
[201:49.98]Why is he getting out of here?
[201:52.70]He's fucking, like, cheesecake.
[202:01.62]Now, like, I want him to come back.
[202:03.44]So I can prove to you that he was big.
[202:07.15]I want him to come out of the wall right now.
[202:08.73]So I can put the camera on him and prove to you guys that he was a big fucking snake.
[202:14.37]I hope he comes out now.
[202:15.31]I was, like, kind of scared of him before.
[202:23.05]I don't think I can do anything else.
[202:27.88]I don't think so.
[202:28.28]I'm gonna go this way.
[202:36.72]Anything?
[202:39.22]Anything?
[202:40.32]He's gonna come out five feet bigger than he was.
[202:44.25]Now that is when you would hear me scream.
[202:47.63]Watch him just come out and his belly is just full with a mouse.
[202:51.87]That would be crazy.
[202:53.19]You know what?
[202:54.03]You know what, guys?
[202:55.59]Good.
[202:56.73]I'm glad he's back there.
[202:58.84]You know why?
[203:00.74]Over the last couple of weeks, I've been hearing some scratchy-scratchies in the wall here.
[203:05.34]There's a mouse in the wall.
[203:07.50]Maybe he'll go in there.
[203:09.22]He'll eat that fucking mouse that's in the wall that's been giving me all kinds of headaches lately.
[203:14.31]I want him in there.
[203:15.07]I hope he has a great time.
[203:18.97]I hope he has a fantastic time.
[203:20.13]He's going to eat that fucking annoying ass mouse that's in the wall.
[203:22.31]No, it's not a rat.
[203:24.95]If it was a rat, there was no way I would allow that.
[203:28.25]If it was a rat in the wall, there's no way I would allow that shit.
[203:31.91]I'm just going for it again.
[203:32.74]No, I'm almost dead.
[203:41.94]What else can I even do here?
[203:44.86]Well, I got two more pieces.
[203:45.86]Let's see if I can expand it.
[203:56.00]Was the snake in the wall?
[203:57.29]No, this snake was not big enough to make that kind of noise.
[204:02.41]Enter the wall myself?
[204:03.25]That means I have to tear my wall down.
[204:04.55]I'm not going to tear my wall down to go get a ringneck snake.
[204:15.94]Doesn't Kim have a cat?
[204:17.46]Yeah.
[204:18.50]But I wouldn't want a cat to... If you're talking about, like, a snake, that could get real ugly.
[204:25.13]Like, a dog or a cat versus a snake or something.
[204:28.09]Let's expand it.
[204:32.83]You never want, like, a dog or a cat to run into, like, a fucking snake.
[204:36.07]Because they'll just be like, what's this thing?
[204:37.62]And go over to its face and just bite him.
[204:43.66]Isn't it past my bedtime?
[204:44.56]Well, soon.
[204:46.30]Soon here.
[204:48.55]Over the next, uh, I don't know, we'll see.
[204:51.33]We'll see how much fun I have in the extended ice world.
[204:54.67]It's gonna be going in my ear when I'm sleeping.
[205:02.44]Oh god, don't say that.
[205:07.49]No, I don't need an exterminator.
[205:08.75]Here's how I would need an exterminator.
[205:11.01]If tomorrow I came down into this office and I opened the door and there were like nine snakes in the ground, I would slowly close the door, slowly walk up the stairs.
[205:23.80]Pick up my phone.
[205:25.66]Very calmly call somebody.
[205:28.06]Like a company that would come and specialize in that.
[205:31.30]Very slowly talk about it.
[205:34.55]I have this problem here.
[205:36.37]There are snakes all over my house.
[205:39.19]Okay.
[205:40.07]That sounds like a lot of fun.
[205:41.11]Thank you so much.
[205:42.37]I'd hang the phone up.
[205:43.31]They would be there at my appointment for like an hour later.
[205:45.70]And I would scream.
[205:48.82]And I would curl into a little fetal position and be like... And I would just get it out.
[205:55.62]I missed all this, by the way.
[205:58.00]I missed everything.
[205:58.64]There's two keys?
[206:00.04]I missed that whole thing.
[206:01.70]They're gonna have to rip your walls out.
[206:14.91]Yeah, was anybody that was paying attention to that?
[206:17.09]What does that mean?
[206:21.15]Talk about a delayed reaction.
[206:26.48]What the hell was all that?
[206:34.14]Over here?
[206:35.08]I don't even... I don't know where the hell that was.
[206:42.72]Why the fuck would we be paying attention?
[206:44.34]Alright.
[206:48.16]I bought the keys.
[206:52.99]Where did they go to?
[206:54.25]Because I wasn't paying attention.
[206:56.43]Down here?
[207:06.07]We got the keys, we got the keys, we got the keys.
[207:12.32]Okay.
[207:13.72]I love how somebody just wrote, oh my god, this game is so boring.
[207:18.84]I don't know what to say.
[207:28.57]Key?
[207:29.45]Door?
[207:29.91]I don't... I wish I was paying any attention there.
[207:34.09]Like, any at all.
[207:40.89]I can't even get up there.
[207:44.37]Am I wrong?
[207:47.75]Am I wrong?
[208:04.02]Does this do anything?
[208:05.92]She didn't do anything.
[208:10.88]What do I do with these?
[208:15.01]I can't get up here.
[208:19.67]Whoa!
[208:21.15]That almost worked.
[208:27.13]Just admit it.
[208:27.75]The game sucks.
[208:30.46]No, not yet.
[208:31.44]I can't say that.
[208:32.54]Ugh.
[208:36.66]Alright, you got me.
[208:38.27]Alright.
[208:39.67]Use honey for the ice.
[208:41.93]How do you use the honey?
[208:43.65]There's no... What?
[208:44.91]What do you mean use the honey?
[208:46.79]Like, how do I use the honey?
[208:49.03]There's no button I can press.
[208:50.80]I can't knock it down.
[208:55.78]Is that like sonar the honey?
[208:59.14]Okay.
[209:17.49]Anybody know how to do this?
[209:26.35]Uh, okay.
[209:29.85]Lick the honey.
[209:33.01]Um, you mean like that?
[209:35.49]I feel like that's not doing anything.
[209:50.07]Did you use the snake?
[209:53.43]I need to purchase another slurp upgrade.
[209:55.99]Did I try pouring milk on my router?
[210:00.47]I actually have not tried that yet.
[210:02.95]That's actually a pretty good suggestion.
[210:04.45]I have not done that yet.
[210:06.23]I haven't tried to dump milk on my electronics.
[210:08.23]Fuck.
[210:08.35]Maybe I should do that.
[210:13.39]Where's the other keyhole?
[210:17.34]Where the fuck is any of this shit?
[210:19.96]Underwater?
[210:20.64]Maybe.
[210:20.88]Maybe.
[210:21.12]Let's go look.
[210:21.62]Under here, maybe?
[210:43.48]Let's give it a look.
[210:51.78]Looks deep over here.
[210:52.86]There's a jellyfish.
[210:59.68]Okay, there's a place to go under here.
[211:00.86]Let's take a look.
[211:02.22]I didn't come down here yet.
[211:06.42]Let's take a look.
[211:09.17]I'm gonna drink my OJ.
[211:17.68]Gloomy Gem Grotto.
[211:22.83]Okay, I can't do anything here.
[211:37.81]Can't sneak through that.
[211:40.93]Well... Apparently not.
[211:49.33]Grab that grotto.
[211:53.42]Alright.
[211:55.14]I think, uh... I think Papa Jeremy's gonna be taking a little bit of a break here.
[211:59.44]I can't see.
[212:01.94]Yeah, I think Papa Jeremy's gonna take a little bit of a, uh... A little bit of a dad nap.
[212:07.14]You know what I'm saying?
[212:09.67]Well... Hold on.
[212:13.35]Who needs light?
[212:15.31]I can see where I'm going.
[212:16.09]Right...
[212:23.02]Alright, uh, dad- Papa Jeremy's gonna take a little bit of a dad nap.
[212:25.99]Let's take a look, see if we can find a, uh, snake.
[212:32.83]No.
[212:33.03]I think he's just gone.
[212:37.63]Just gone.
[212:38.15]Maybe they'll be here tomorrow.
[212:42.53]I will take pictures and videos if the snake is here tomorrow, though.
[212:48.04]Come on, Etalyx, what the fuck?
[212:54.19]This is a Skate 3 level stream?
[212:55.81]No, it was not.
[212:58.43]I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
[212:59.63]I've never played Skate 3.
[213:00.89]Why do you guys keep referring to that?
[213:04.42]I keep seeing people talk about like, oh, what a Skate 3 stream.
[213:06.98]I never played Skate 3.
[213:12.10]I've wanted to play that game.
[213:13.38]I've wanted to stream it.
[213:14.04]I've never even thought to play it yet.
[213:18.66]I'm gonna drown in Luca... Luca Yele.
[213:23.87]Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is, that is Luke, that is Luke.
[213:27.09]I can't, Yooka-Laylee.
[213:29.31]That is Yooka-Laylee.
[213:33.95]Thank you for watching.
[213:34.55]If you liked what you saw, Yooka-Laylee is a very, very solidly overpriced $40.
[213:41.74]If you liked what you saw.
[213:44.04]And it's, yeah.
[213:49.65]I'm going to give it the stamp of... of Dove.
[213:54.97]Okay, here it is.
[213:57.19]I'm going to give it the stamp of approval.
[213:58.91]There it is.
[213:59.71]And I stamped it.
[214:00.41]Stamped it down right on the case.
[214:01.55]The ukulele case.
[214:02.38]I lifted the stamp up.
[214:03.34]There ain't any ink in that stamp.
[214:09.32]It's not on there.
[214:10.10]There's no stamp there.
[214:12.96]So it didn't work.
[214:15.49]Even if I handed that to somebody, there would be no stamp on it.
[214:21.84]Ah.
[214:22.78]And I wouldn't care enough to refill the ink.
[214:26.79]Right.
[214:27.33]So, like, I'm not gonna... Could I go, like, down the hall into my office and pick up the ink and refill the stamp?
[214:34.57]Sure.
[214:36.25]But, uh... Not gonna.
[214:39.77]Slight table banging.
[214:47.82]How about stream bayonetta?
[214:48.96]I actually was gonna do that.
[214:52.70]Is that the $200 joke?
[214:54.02]No.
[214:54.48]That wasn't a joke.
[214:55.70]That was me making a fucking metaphor.
[214:57.04]No, not recommended.
[215:02.06]There you go.
[215:02.88]There was a roundabout way for me to tell you that the game's not recommended.
[215:05.34]I don't think you should buy it.
[215:06.98]There you go.
[215:10.09]Save yourself $40 and go buy $40 worth of Cheez-Its.
[215:14.93]Or, if you are a massive, like, 3D adventure collector kind, you need to play them all and you love the genre, get it.
[215:24.11]Because... I don't know.
[215:27.19]It's just missing something for me.
[215:29.87]I was a big fan of Banjo-Kazooie and Mario 64.
[215:33.27]Mario 64 is what I grew up on that shit.
[215:36.13]That was amazing.
[215:38.98]It feels like something's missing and it feels like... Well, all the worlds feel kind of empty.
[215:44.84]There's these random dickheads running around in circles.
[215:47.08]They have one AI path.
[215:48.60]See the guys behind me?
[215:50.96]It feels... There's a huge open kind of world here that doesn't feel like there's anybody here.
[215:55.36]It's like a ghost town.
[215:56.10]There's like four enemies in each level.
[216:02.39]And that won't necessarily be a bad thing, but... I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
[216:11.07]Anyways.
[216:12.05]I'm not going to say it's a bad game, because I don't think it's a bad game.
[216:17.07]I would say probably wait for...
[216:19.98]Some of the other, like, 3D platformers coming up.
[216:24.81]Wait for my game, A Hat in Time, right?
[216:26.77]Hypo, yeah, pitch that shit.
[216:31.47]Hat in Time, that is still a thing.
[216:37.40]Maybe you don't like the genre?
[216:41.18]So, Italic says, what you're saying is $40 seems like a lot.
[216:43.62]Yes.
[216:46.69]$40 is way too much money for this game, I think.
[216:50.89]Especially... I think I have this like weird... Yeah, I'm gonna pause it.
[216:54.75]Like, I have this weird... I'm pausing, it doesn't do anything.
[216:57.00]I need to turn the music off.
[216:59.18]I have this weird thing with, uh, kickstarted games.
[217:02.44]That... I mean, this might sound like kind of... This might be... I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion or not, but... A kickstarted game... I feel like was already paid for.
[217:11.20]So if a game gets like millions of dollars on Kickstarter...
[217:15.39]I don't, I kind of feel like the game was already paid for.
[217:19.19]And for them, like for people that have a kickstarted fully like million plus kind of dollar kickstarted game to sell the game for 40 bucks.
[217:25.94]I mean, you already like made the money for making the game and you're kind of doing it again.
[217:30.86]And like, that's fine.
[217:32.86]But like more than like 30, 40, 50 bucks for like a kickstarted kind of game.
[217:36.12]I feel like you already, I feel like you already made the money for the game when you got kickstarted, kind of.
[217:41.80]And like everyone took like the salaries and,
[217:45.30]You don't make any profit.
[217:46.04]Yeah, I know, but it feels weird to hear that, like, oh, game got kickstarted.
[217:50.22]These guys made a shitload of money making this game.
[217:52.75]Because it's like four dudes, or like five people, whatever, right?
[217:59.15]That's why it's fairly... I wouldn't say not to sell the game.
[218:02.77]That's not what I'm saying.
[218:07.53]I'm not saying don't sell the game.
[218:11.15]I'm just saying that, like, when a game like this gets kickstarted,
[218:16.81]Like, for that game then to be $40?
[218:20.21]It's like, hmm.
[218:22.49]It's a little expensive considering that the game was kickstarted.
[218:34.94]We have issues with people re-kickstarting.
[218:36.36]Yeah, and sometimes you get a game that gets kickstarted and then it goes to, like, early access.
[218:43.72]See, but that didn't happen with this game, and I'm not saying that that's the case with this.
[218:50.19]And again, there is nothing wrong with kickstarting a game and then selling it.
[218:53.35]That's obviously, like, not a big deal.
[218:55.47]But for me, personally, like, when a game gets kickstarted, and then it's like 40, 50 bucks, it's like, ooh, it's kind of expensive, and mmh.
[219:18.57]Should cost as much as a bag of cheese nips.
[219:26.61]Shut up, Germany.
[219:27.35]You try making a Kickstarter game.
[219:28.73]It would probably be pretty good because you're very talented.
[219:31.91]Game development is fucking hard.
[219:33.63]Look, these guys got a game Kickstarted and they did it and they finished it.
[219:37.89]Like, so honest to fucking God, they deserve respect for that.
[219:44.64]Because that shit is kind of rare.
[219:46.42]For, like, a game to be, like, good enough and, like, fun.
[219:48.72]Because I think the game's fun.
[219:51.42]I just don't think it's, like, I wouldn't, like, really recommend you buy it for $40.
[220:01.35]But no.
[220:02.41]There's plenty of games that have been kickstarted that sell.
[220:05.41]And they're great.
[220:05.89]And they're fine.
[220:06.35]Bye.
[220:09.36]Like I said, it's just a little personal opinion based around selling a product for a lot of money.
[220:14.00]That was kickstarted.
[220:14.90]That's all I'm saying.
[220:16.86]No big deal.
[220:20.48]But.
[220:21.92]Take it easy, everybody.
[220:22.90]Thank you for watching.
[220:23.94]Much love.
[220:25.50]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[220:28.60]We're probably going to do something a little different on Thursday.
[220:31.65]As you'll see.
[220:33.25]Maybe it'll be fun.
[220:35.03]Whoa!
[220:35.99]Right before I'm about to turn off the stream.
[220:40.58]Hello.
[220:42.06]Hello there.
[220:42.60]Oh god, hold on.
[220:44.06]Where did it go?
[220:44.56]Lucky Strike gave 150 bucks right at the end.
[220:57.17]It says, quick, take these.
[220:58.25]It's dangerous to go alone with a snake in the room.
[221:02.91]Well, thank you so much, LuckyStrike.
[221:04.83]You were one of a few guys that gave a fucking shitload of money tonight.
[221:08.70]So, much love.
[221:10.10]Thank you so much, LuckyStrike.
[221:11.70]Thank you so much to the other people that have donated through the whole stream.
[221:16.10]And, yeah.
[221:18.20]Have a great night, everybody.
[221:22.88]Much love, much respect.
[221:24.75]See you guys on Thursday.
[221:27.48]It looks like fun.
[221:28.12]I may buy it for like $10.
[221:29.00]I think it's worth more than $10.
[221:30.90]I do.
[221:31.12]I think I might... I think it's even okay at like $30.
[221:35.70]Like $29.99.
[221:35.92]Or like $24.99.
[221:36.32]$40 is pushing it a little.
[221:36.94]I think.
[221:37.60]A little.
[221:38.00]That's all I was trying to say.
[221:56.08]Anywho, much love.
[221:57.92]Take care, everybody.
[221:58.42]See you Thursday.
[221:59.64]And have a good rest of your night.
[222:20.67]Bye-bye.
[222:39.42]Thank you.
