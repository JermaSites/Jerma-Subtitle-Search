[00:01.97]Hello, family.
[00:05.18]How you doing?
[00:09.50]I'm practicing.
[00:10.48]I'm practicing right now for the time that I'm going to be streaming.
[00:17.91]This is what time it's going to be for me.
[00:21.17]When I start streaming in Vegas, I'm going to start streaming around like 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:26.32]Pacific.
[00:28.56]So I need to get into the day schedule.
[00:31.27]We gotta get into this day schedule.
[00:32.91]Spell iCup.
[00:38.29]I don't think I will.
[00:40.09]I had to think about that for a second.
[00:41.33]I was about to do it.
[00:45.31]So one message that I read is that one.
[00:50.32]Anyways, hello.
[00:52.42]We are going to play more Spider-Man today.
[00:57.18]Make sure that all these things are set.
[00:58.70]They are looking good.
[01:00.18]Okay.
[01:05.44]There we go.
[01:07.88]He doesn't reach out.
[01:08.86]I'm looking at it right now.
[01:12.21]I can see you right now.
[01:17.93]When am I going to do a face reveal?
[01:22.07]I don't know.
[01:23.40]Never.
[01:24.62]Maybe later.
[01:27.86]Better get some clothes on.
[01:28.94]No, I need to get into the look here.
[01:31.72]I'm gonna give you guys a quick little story Okay, here's a small story while we wait for people to trickle in I'm a naked guy, right?
[01:41.28]Some of you might know what that means.
[01:43.32]I like to not wear clothes.
[01:44.34]I like to walk around naked I like to take showers naked.
[01:48.88]I like to be in my own space just naked sometimes with underwear on right and
[01:55.68]Here's the problem.
[01:57.70]I've been with my girlfriend for a long time now, right?
[02:03.02]And that don't matter.
[02:04.56]I can be in my underwear on the couch.
[02:07.38]But I have to start to learn now how to put on clothes because I'm going to be obviously sharing a space, not just with my girlfriend, but with another person that's not my girlfriend.
[02:19.06]So I got to start putting clothes on.
[02:21.38]That's hard for me to do.
[02:22.98]I'm going to mess up sometimes.
[02:30.79]How do I put clothes?
[02:31.73]I'm just telling you, I might mess up sometimes.
[02:35.77]I'll forget.
[02:37.49]I'll come out of that shower and I will walk down the stairs just naked.
[02:41.87]And I'll forget there's another person there.
[02:43.43]I'm going to be like, oh, fuck.
[02:49.11]But yes, I've been practicing putting on clothes.
[02:54.03]Sleeping in your bed?
[02:54.69]I don't sleep naked.
[02:55.87]I just like to exist naked.
[03:00.63]Sleeping naked.
[03:01.27]No, I gotta have like, I gotta have something on.
[03:09.86]Sleeping is the best thing to do naked.
[03:11.94]No, it's not.
[03:13.76]I hate that.
[03:14.96]You know, here's something funny.
[03:16.29]Kim gives me shit all the time because I wear socks in bed.
[03:22.35]Is that a problem?
[03:24.23]Apparently that's a huge problem.
[03:27.93]I wear socks in bed.
[03:31.94]What's wrong with me?
[03:34.82]Serial killer confirmed.
[03:36.71]What?
[03:38.81]They're comfortable socks and they keep my feet nice and toasty.
[03:41.55]I don't want to... I get like cold.
[03:44.20]And they end up having to bunch up the covers and stuff them under your toes and stuff.
[03:48.04]No, I just wear socks.
[03:56.63]Socks have been proven to actually help you sleep better.
[03:59.05]Thank you, scientist in the chat room.
[04:00.71]I appreciate that.
[04:01.49]Thank you.
[04:03.51]But, you know, I've been trying to put clothes on.
[04:07.85]I've been practicing.
[04:10.87]I mean, I can prove it to you right now, obviously, right?
[04:12.92]Like, I'm wearing clothes.
[04:16.80]I've also been working on some back stretches.
[04:21.22]Like these.
[04:26.51]Like this.
[04:28.03]Because that's nothing.
[04:28.75]When you live with somebody else, you've got to make sure.
[04:30.75]I've got to teach him this one.
[04:32.05]Alex doesn't know this.
[04:32.71]Kim doesn't know this one either.
[04:33.59]If you turn around in your chair, it actually helps a little bit more.
[04:38.57]You never want to be facing the screen when you do these stretches.
[04:42.74]I'll teach him this.
[04:58.36]Oh, by the way, every number was 17.
[04:59.76]This is like a special shirt.
[05:06.69]God, the light really makes me look like fucking Goblin Man, huh?
[05:09.33]2017, yeah.
[05:16.93]They're all 17.
[05:29.57]Stop flexing.
[05:33.03]Game sucks.
[05:33.67]What?
[05:35.29]What are you talking about?
[05:35.99]This game is great.
[05:36.77]Let's just, let's start playing it because I want to play it.
[05:41.45]That's a good reason to stream it, right?
[05:42.71]I want to play.
[05:43.47]Oh boy.
[05:44.27]I've done that like four times already.
[05:46.04]I've already struck out.
[05:51.26]Let's get that over here.
[05:54.04]Okay.
[05:54.92]So here we are.
[05:59.32]And currently, uh... We ended last night on the edge of a building.
[06:08.32]This is Jerm's 15th, 17th birthday.
[06:17.75]I don't know why I find that as funny as I do.
[06:19.87]But I do.
[06:21.19]That's a very funny way to put that.
[06:22.61]That was for TwitchCon last year.
[06:26.37]If you were like a... Whatever, you know what I'm saying.
[06:31.06]So, I don't know what we're doing next, but I'm going to go do it.
[06:38.77]Why am I streaming this early?
[06:41.71]Well, because I want to play Spider-Man.
[06:45.13]I woke up this morning, I had a doctor's appointment this morning, and all I was thinking of was, man, I really just can't wait to play Spider-Man.
[06:52.33]And then, I mean, obviously, that stream's going to turn on.
[06:57.48]What are these two things to do here?
[07:03.94]What are the two different missions?
[07:06.12]Oh.
[07:07.24]It's just this one.
[07:09.72]Was there one on my... Was there two on my screen, or have I just lost my mind?
[07:15.86]Also, another thing is, if you're just trickling in and hearing me talk for the first time, I'm trying to get myself into an afternoon schedule.
[07:24.29]Because this is the time I'll be streaming Pacific.
[07:28.39]Oh, I'm sure there's another way in.
[07:34.72]Uh, I'm gonna guess we're gonna go through a vent.
[07:40.42]Maybe.
[07:43.28]Uh, I mean the truck.
[07:45.74]There's a vent over there.
[07:48.01]Sorry, spider emergency.
[07:52.89]There it is.
[07:55.51]Open.
[07:55.71]It's not really breaking and entering if I don't break anything, right?
[07:58.89]Uh, the only way to go is this way.
[08:00.61]Okay, no need to panic.
[08:02.35]Maybe they haven't dumped the trash yet.
[08:04.77]Oh yeah, that's right.
[08:05.31]I was trying to find my bank statement or something.
[08:08.47]What was I looking for?
[08:09.08]I gotta find my bank statement in the trash.
[08:11.86]No, God.
[08:12.00]Yeah, it'll end up being around the same time for everybody else.
[08:13.46]Because remember, Pacific is three hours behind right now for me.
[08:33.99]Time zones are so weird, man.
[08:36.26]Seriously.
[08:36.72]Can I just go with the front door?
[08:38.82]Or do I have to re-break and enter, right?
[08:40.92]Yeah, I have to re-break in and enter.
[08:51.46]Hey, it's a long shot, but sometimes the guys stop for pizza before they drop off.
[08:56.61]Go to a pizza place.
[08:57.87]You got it.
[08:58.09]I'll check out the pizza shops.
[08:59.97]Any idea which one?
[09:01.73]One of the mom and pop joints, I think.
[09:03.63]Jerry's?
[09:05.13]I think it was Sal's pizza.
[09:06.27]I mean, original Jerry's.
[09:07.91]Oh, fuck.
[09:09.03]This is New York.
[09:09.63]There's like 75 of those.
[09:12.75]Wait, is he making that joke right now?
[09:17.33]Why am I trying to grab the truck?
[09:18.69]Alright, it's not gonna be... Pizza!
[09:20.97]That looks like good pizza.
[09:22.93]Where's the other truck?
[09:24.70]Right there, this way.
[09:43.98]Excuse me.
[09:45.62]Free pizza.
[09:45.96]All kinds of takeout here.
[09:47.66]I'm so annoying.
[09:48.16]I'm irritating him.
[09:50.06]I keep calling the trash company.
[09:51.56]Am I gonna get a time load on this or no?
[10:18.87]It'd be great.
[10:19.43]If there was a 10 second time limit, that'd be so funny.
[10:25.49]There's no other food in New York.
[10:30.16]Fucking New York, man.
[10:33.50]So many people.
[10:34.40]What are they?
[10:37.08]Aren't there like 10 million people in New York City or something crazy?
[10:43.21]There's the incinerator.
[10:44.65]Hope I'm not too late.
[10:49.76]What?
[10:50.92]Why are you guys attacking the trash company?
[11:07.03]That's right.
[11:11.17]That's right.
[11:11.71]I don't have anything else to say.
[11:12.83]I have to concentrate on the game.
[11:14.43]Yeah, that's right.
[11:17.05]Alright, do you have my stuff?
[11:20.12]Button mashing?
[11:20.80]I am pressing fast a sequence of combos.
[11:22.92]Okay.
[11:23.08]Is that it?
[11:23.52]Is that my science project?
[11:24.48]What am I looking for?
[11:49.45]Is this drugs?
[11:50.03]What is this?
[11:51.01]Please be here.
[11:51.79]Please be here.
[11:54.18]Yes.
[11:57.60]Hope it still works.
[11:59.62]Oh, yes.
[12:00.02]It's still hot.
[12:01.68]It's pizza.
[12:03.22]Phew.
[12:03.66]Looks like everything's here.
[12:06.02]Web bomb prototype.
[12:07.22]An old gadget prototype.
[12:08.72]Ooh.
[12:09.22]Looks kind of awesome.
[12:10.24]That looks pretty cool.
[12:10.92]Why did I never finish it?
[12:11.70]I think I can make this work.
[12:18.55]Interesting.
[12:19.19]Proximity triggered explosive that instantly webs all enemies in range.
[12:25.55]That's very cool, actually.
[12:30.15]Can I upgrade it?
[12:30.69]No.
[12:33.03]So this is just a little grenade.
[12:34.96]This is a Spider-Man grenade.
[12:38.00]Cool.
[12:38.20]Wait, more people dress up as Spider-Man?
[12:48.62]That's tier... Hey, use the bomb!
[12:54.61]Uh... Okay, that was cool.
[12:56.49]I'm gonna web up a large group of enemies.
[13:01.43]So I want to do something here.
[13:05.60]Let me just see how this works.
[13:13.16]Trying to see how the... Is there like an indicator if you're doing the perfect attack?
[13:18.10]And I'm not sure.
[13:18.68]38, 39, 40.
[13:20.39]41, 42, 43.
[13:20.53]Oh, we got... Whoa, there's still a guy here.
[13:22.69]There's still two people here.
[13:44.23]I'm so glad I could not have to deal with this massive glare.
[13:49.55]They threw the window.
[13:51.97]Like, just look at this shit, man.
[13:53.33]You want to see how fucking... You want to see how stupid this is?
[13:57.41]I'll show you.
[13:57.99]I'll show you how dumb this is.
[13:59.27]Because I ain't gonna get an opportunity to do this again.
[14:01.81]So there is a massive... I don't have a curtain here.
[14:05.11]I never drilled the holes.
[14:06.07]I'm just a fucking loser, right?
[14:08.56]You can see the sun coming in here, but look what I've tried to do.
[14:11.98]Are you ready for this?
[14:15.51]You can't even see it.
[14:16.31]I have to turn it down.
[14:18.47]When you see it, you'll know.
[14:19.75]You'll laugh.
[14:25.25]Watch this.
[14:27.45]This is how I'm trying to deal with the glare coming into this room right now.
[14:30.13]You ready?
[14:38.25]Those are paper towels.
[14:41.78]I have paper towels wedged in my window to stop the glare.
[14:48.98]I have to turn this all the way down for you to see this.
[14:51.36]I just don't have a fucking curtain there.
[15:07.17]Just use a towel.
[15:08.57]It doesn't... I've tried.
[15:09.37]I can't wedge a towel in there.
[15:11.25]It doesn't stick in there.
[15:12.63]I try to... I can't do it.
[15:14.45]And if I put a towel in there, it's just thick enough where the window has to be open.
[15:19.04]Like this much.
[15:20.36]And bugs and flies and monsters can come in that window.
[15:25.63]Did I take?
[15:26.03]Okay, I took off the thing where I had the blood taken today.
[15:31.43]Tape?
[15:31.71]What do you mean?
[15:32.29]I'm not going to tape up the window.
[15:34.61]God damn it.
[15:35.57]Why do I keep doing this?
[15:37.72]I need to move this.
[15:43.58]Tape the towel.
[15:45.60]That's a... No!
[15:47.04]I'm not gonna tape up the... That's a pain in the ass!
[15:52.88]Why did I just do that?
[15:55.34]Did you see that?
[15:58.18]That was like... You just... You just walked up to me as an in-game character and I was doing my own NPC thing and then you pressed X on me.
[16:05.85]And I was ready to talk to you.
[16:08.29]What the fuck is this?
[16:12.51]Alright, let's go.
[16:18.46]Don't worry.
[16:18.76]The sun's going down in the next, like, three hours.
[16:20.86]So I don't want to deal with it for very long.
[16:27.09]Alright, let's do it.
[16:28.57]Let's do it.
[16:30.51]Yeah, I had a doctor's appointment today.
[16:31.63]I'm trying to get these weird issues with my body sorted out.
[16:40.46]Before moving to Las Vegas.
[16:42.42]I'm trying to stick the cutscene.
[16:52.49]I'm just in the neighborhood and it's like three it's it's four o'clock in the afternoon on a Tuesday Why am I making this such a big deal die We're just friends right friends crash on each other's couches all the time.
[17:13.51]It's not weird or anything That was cool
[17:26.35]And here we are.
[17:31.80]What time will it be in Vegas?
[17:32.72]Me streaming at 4 p.m., 3 p.m.
[17:33.26]Pacific is about 6 or 7 o'clock Eastern.
[17:35.72]So the time is not going to change.
[17:36.92]But the time for me will change.
[17:51.02]Just gonna be pulling it back.
[17:52.08]So, the streaming time's not gonna change very much.
[17:54.32]That's, uh... That's Catwoman.
[17:56.30]Catch me if you can.
[17:57.90]Catwoman.
[17:58.38]Mm-hmm.
[17:59.98]No, wait.
[18:00.48]Cat... No, wrong universe.
[18:02.90]That's, uh... The other... Black Cat.
[18:05.42]Right.
[18:05.72]I had it correct.
[18:07.00]I just had the name wrong.
[18:24.41]I'll do it.
[18:29.56]Throw five objects.
[18:32.94]Like this.
[18:39.14]Any more objects to throw?
[18:45.17]Don't you do it.
[18:45.97]Whoa, what am I doing?
[18:48.41]Grenade.
[18:54.85]Gonna pick up more stuff.
[18:59.25]Any more, like, barrels to throw?
[19:03.49]I just want to get this over with first.
[19:08.15]Come on, needs more objects.
[19:11.05]Like this.
[19:16.46]And like this.
[19:19.34]And one more.
[19:19.96]Throw the trash.
[19:22.54]Alright, now we gotta throw people in the air.
[19:24.10]Sounds like fun.
[19:28.32]One more, two more, hello.
[19:33.63]Try to do this.
[19:35.49]No, that's not gonna work.
[19:42.84]I might not even get it.
[19:43.46]Unless there's more people here.
[19:47.60]I did not get it.
[19:48.38]Shit.
[19:49.32]What's the research thing here?
[19:52.16]Climb.
[19:52.30]Yum.
[19:52.38]Crime tokens.
[19:52.94]Oops.
[19:53.18]Right here.
[20:19.34]Alright.
[20:20.04]Actually, I kind of hate these.
[20:21.83]This is the one where you have to go pick up birds and clean up gas leaks and stuff.
[20:29.91]The station is kind of my answer to Oscorp's hopefully soon-to-be-discontinued chemical weapons research facility.
[20:37.24]Systematic counteragents to some of the world's most dangerous chemical agents.
[20:41.48]Of course, doing that NLS requires us to goddamn son...
[20:47.96]needs to be blocked out let's start it okay be careful in here Pete this station analyzes hazardous chemicals and basically trying to figure out how to counteract them if they ever got out into the world which hopefully they never will
[21:08.94]Just use some paper towel.
[21:10.36]That's a good idea.
[21:11.56]Alright, let's go through a cloud right now.
[21:13.43]And wear sunglasses?
[21:24.49]Spider-bots are still just prototypes.
[21:26.55]This is a good time to test one find its sensors can follow the chemical trail Better than me swinging up on the thief if he freaks out and drops the hydrazine He'll blow up half a block gotta find a quiet place to deploy the spider-bot where I can hang out and guide it So you want to go down here?
[21:49.16]Activate spider-bot
[21:50.61]Okay, little guy.
[21:51.43]Let's find where the chemical dripped and vacuum it up before it makes someone sick.
[21:57.52]Okay, I'm just playing Natural Selection 2.
[22:04.04]Is this how you start the game?
[22:07.64]Not only is Mini-Me cleaning up the spills, it's leading me right to the thief.
[22:15.38]No one is looking at this or cares about this?
[22:21.75]All of a sudden, some guy walks over and just lifts his leg up and stomps on him.
[22:26.77]The thief's hiding in crowds.
[22:28.81]Okay.
[22:29.33]I'll disperse him with a subsonic blast.
[22:31.61]Won't hurt anyone, but it's super annoying.
[22:35.78]Quick, disperse!
[22:37.42]Which way are they going?
[22:38.86]Which one is he?
[22:39.54]Which one's the thief?
[22:43.60]Well, I guess he's not over there.
[22:45.62]Lucky this stuff's only dangerous over a long exposure.
[22:48.68]Or if it combusts.
[22:54.26]Yeah, we have reports of a large bug making supersonic screaming sounds.
[22:59.51]Maybe not.
[23:08.53]So can... Am I the only person that can see these?
[23:11.41]Giant stink clouds?
[23:15.31]Or is this just people just kind of walking around New York and it's like, ah, whatever.
[23:18.17]There's a stink cloud over there.
[23:25.69]It's running.
[23:26.11]Alright, extract.
[23:27.83]That's it.
[23:28.83]Spiderbot.
[23:58.43]What the fuck are you talking about?
[24:03.83]Oh my god.
[24:07.01]Jesus Christ.
[24:07.63]Jesus.
[24:08.01]Somebody had to type that.
[24:09.13]Ugh.
[24:27.61]Wait, hold on.
[24:29.57]Go to the address.
[24:35.51]This is not the address.
[24:39.52]Thanks for the tokens.
[24:46.20]Why do I always choose the worst message to read?
[24:48.32]It just happens to me when I look over and just see, like, okay, what did that person say?
[24:51.78]What did that person say?
[24:53.62]I just see that one.
[24:54.54]I just happen to see that one.
[24:56.76]That's just how it is.
[24:59.97]What the hell is that?
[25:02.07]Oh, okay.
[25:04.99]Is this not the address?
[25:06.95]Hello, spider.
[25:08.43]Been thinking about you a lot lately.
[25:10.91]We were good together, weren't we?
[25:12.85]Maybe it's time to reignite the flame.
[25:17.99]Okay, let's look through the camera.
[25:20.19]Does anything look out of place?
[25:21.27]That kind of does.
[25:46.65]She puts these down?
[25:48.35]What about the whole mural that's painted on that wall?
[25:50.12]I can get some black cat tokens.
[25:52.52]No?
[25:52.60]No, I guess not.
[25:53.18]Okay.
[26:21.64]Heard a joke today.
[26:22.36]What's the difference between a brush head and a brush head?
[26:28.98]About 5,000 hairs and twice as many brain cells.
[26:33.13]The person replied to themself.
[26:34.67]You can't just put that... You can't hit space and then enter two or three times?
[26:40.03]Spider-Man just popped in and threw trash around.
[26:42.45]JJJ was right.
[26:43.47]He's a menace.
[26:45.71]He is a litterally a litterbug.
[26:50.85]Two puns, one post.
[26:54.46]Ran through a firefight between police and demons for my morning Joe.
[26:57.44]Just another day.
[26:58.16]I have 15 million fans?
[27:05.56]Wait a minute, hold on a second.
[27:07.04]Spider-Man has 15.3 million fans.
[27:08.72]Um...
[27:18.24]So wait, Spider-Man doesn't even have as many subscribers.
[27:20.54]It's like PewDiePie.
[27:23.66]How can Spider-Man be less popular than like PewDiePie?
[27:31.77]This should be like 500 million.
[27:37.71]He only works in New York City.
[27:42.54]How many subscribers do I have?
[27:44.93]No, I don't have that many.
[27:48.09]I have like 600, 700,000.
[27:56.08]Jake and Logan Paul have more Twitter followers, don't they?
[28:01.44]Come on, Spider-Man can't even come that close?
[28:11.81]Hey Yuri, you still have Black Cat's suit and equipment in the evidence lockup, right?
[28:15.71]I think so.
[28:16.15]Why?
[28:16.55]Is she back at it?
[28:17.29]Maybe.
[28:17.53]Just double check and let me know if her gear is still there.
[28:21.37]Will do.
[28:21.63]Hey Mei, you're calling late.
[28:22.29]What's up?
[28:36.02]he does let's plays face cam right I'm sorry I forgot it's been a hard day we lost funding at the lab
[28:46.36]Let's go.
[28:46.70]Make sure to like and subscribe, spiderlings.
[28:49.88]That's so cool.
[28:50.52]Watch this.
[28:50.84]You hear that?
[28:51.24]That's so cool.
[28:51.60]The transition between him talking and grunting talking.
[29:15.84]That took some thought.
[29:16.48]Like, no one's ever done that.
[29:18.06]Whoever the sound engineer guy, whoever the guy that thought that was a good idea.
[29:21.72]That's such a good idea.
[29:23.28]That person deserves a raise.
[29:24.76]Who's shooting me?
[29:34.63]What?
[29:35.73]What?
[29:36.09]Why are you shooting rockets?
[29:56.67]I don't even see what the objectives were.
[30:01.64]10 swing kicks.
[30:02.54]Oh, I don't think I'm gonna get that now.
[30:12.57]I don't think so.
[30:13.47]That's not gonna work.
[30:14.31]Oh, this one.
[30:15.35]We'll try it again.
[30:24.70]I will kick one of you.
[30:27.24]Eventually.
[30:27.90]There's not even enough people to kick here.
[30:39.84]So, might as well... Yes, there is.
[30:49.30]Do it!
[30:50.20]Oh, fuck it.
[30:50.64]Whatever.
[30:50.92]Just kill these guys, please.
[30:55.90]Got it.
[30:56.84]Shit!
[30:58.00]He's gonna be alright, isn't he?
[31:00.22]Where is he?
[31:00.58]He's dead.
[31:00.96]Damn it.
[31:29.67]What am I doing here?
[31:30.71]I need to go behind these guys.
[31:32.09]I don't know why the hell they were even up there in the first place.
[31:59.18]Dudes?
[31:59.78]What do you mean, dudes?
[32:05.86]Don't worry guys, the game thought of that, and enemies you throw off buildings get stuck to the side.
[32:11.22]I mean, that is a good way to put it, but... That's still, you're still going, that's, you're going, you're gonna die.
[32:20.90]If you are tethered to the side of a building and you jump off and you fly all the way down and you rip to the side, you're gonna get squashed.
[32:35.34]I can't believe I haven't slept since the Fisk takedown.
[32:38.36]Gotta start taking better care of myself.
[32:40.54]Inspiration, motivation, progress, success.
[32:44.64]Let me think about that for a second.
[32:48.16]Inspiration, motivation, progress, success.
[32:53.55]I flipped the motivation to inspiration.
[32:55.93]I put motivation up top.
[32:59.11]I put motivation below progress.
[33:01.75]Inspiration, progress, motivation.
[33:03.91]and I'd put success down one more and I would add luck.
[33:08.49]Right?
[33:22.09]I would put success first.
[33:27.42]Success and then motivation.
[33:32.12]Luck 10, 2 charisma.
[33:32.80]Just replace all with luck.
[33:33.58]Am I sleeping in this office?
[33:34.70]Can I crawl under his desk and just sleep there?
[34:03.31]That's the same keyboard that I have.
[34:04.99]No, it's not.
[34:05.35]That's a lie.
[34:06.15]It's close, though.
[34:07.55]It's kind of close.
[34:10.85]Right?
[34:11.85]This is kind of close, isn't it?
[34:15.94]Well, now the exposure is down so much you can't see this.
[34:27.98]See, look.
[34:34.03]Why would I think that?
[34:35.94]Why would my address be on this?
[34:38.32]In case I forgot it?
[34:39.68]See?
[34:41.74]It's just a wireless keyboard.
[34:44.10]There's no other difference.
[34:45.19]That's it.
[34:48.37]That's it.
[34:52.59]I saw wireless keyboard and automatically they were the same thing.
[35:00.49]I drew my address on my keyboard.
[35:02.55]Alright, what the fuck am I doing?
[35:09.01]This guy got like a password behind him.
[35:11.77]This is me.
[35:15.93]Well, we all have an awkward face.
[35:23.06]Okay.
[35:26.54]So I was into horses.
[35:28.06]Wasn't everybody at some point?
[35:32.24]These are real photos.
[35:39.45]That's clearly not a CG image, is it?
[35:43.35]That's a photo.
[35:45.63]Has graphics gotten to a point where that's not a photo and it's tricking me?
[35:48.99]I don't know.
[36:01.31]I actually am sleeping on the couch in the office.
[36:20.26]Ooh.
[36:23.12]What's that?
[36:23.82]300 bucks.
[36:24.90]I can't take this.
[36:25.66]No, it's 250.
[36:26.82]You can and you will.
[36:29.58]I'll pay you back.
[36:31.74]Soon.
[36:33.76]Just ask for help next time.
[36:35.26]$250.
[36:38.04]You are so much like Ben.
[36:42.12]You have to learn to swallow that Parker pride and accept that you're human, like the rest of us.
[36:48.57]Martin.
[36:49.21]If only she knew.
[36:50.05]Sorry to interrupt.
[36:51.51]Just wanted to let you know I'm headed out of town.
[36:53.57]Sorry to interrupt.
[36:54.09]I heard you're giving out free money in here.
[36:56.43]Well, you can count on me.
[36:57.87]How long will you be away?
[37:00.97]I like that pocket.
[37:02.27]I like- I love that pocket.
[37:03.07]The handkerchief in there that you never use.
[37:22.32]Don't you just one day, just so somebody has one of those, and you're at a big function, just want to take it out of the pocket, blow my nose in it, and put it back in?
[37:30.78]Alright, that may have happened in a Jim Carrey movie.
[37:37.34]I did.
[37:37.62]Did that happen?
[37:38.46]Robbie must be pretty happy right now.
[37:39.96]That happened in The Cable Guy, didn't it?
[37:41.42]It kind of went viral.
[37:42.44]And get this, Mayor Osborne just announced he's going to give Officer Davis an award this afternoon.
[37:47.08]Wow.
[37:48.82]Wait, isn't Osborne's campaign rally this afternoon?
[37:55.09]Focus on the game.
[37:57.11]I was focusing on the game.
[38:00.49]I focused so intently that I noticed the pocket square.
[38:05.91]And I remembered from Ace Ventura 2 when he blows his nose in the guy's pocket square and puts it back.
[38:10.53]I gotta go downstairs.
[38:21.95]I wish I could just jump out.
[38:23.94]Anybody else to talk to?
[38:32.48]Peter.
[38:36.56]Who keeps their phone in their front left pocket?
[38:38.74]I mean, I put my phone pretty much wherever I can get it.
[38:44.40]Front pocket?
[38:45.36]See, I can't put my phone in my back pocket.
[38:48.12]How do you sit down?
[38:52.11]I don't know how people put their wallets in their back pocket.
[38:55.43]Yeah, I see dudes walking around with these big, thick-ass wallets in their back pocket.
[39:01.26]What?
[39:05.14]Isn't that uncomfortable?
[39:14.96]He's a cardholder.
[39:15.66]Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[39:18.24]It's so humiliating taking money from me.
[39:21.51]I should head out into the city and try to pay it forward.
[39:24.58]I said the meme word?
[39:25.62]What's the meme word?
[39:26.46]Wallet?
[39:33.14]This is good stuff.
[39:34.16]Howard.
[39:37.26]Long time no see.
[39:38.62]How's Pidgey doing?
[39:39.82]He's a little down today.
[39:42.03]Misses his cousins.
[39:43.52]Been a bit of a whirlwind for both of us.
[39:46.40]Owners of my building rezoned for commercial.
[39:49.72]We had to move into Feast to get our bearings.
[39:52.56]I'm so sorry.
[39:53.38]New York landlords can really be heartless.
[39:56.80]When they kicked me out of my place, they set all my birds loose.
[40:00.73]Pidgey's the only one who found me.
[40:02.57]I've been looking everywhere for the rest of them, but with my bad leg and all... You know what?
[40:08.43]I'd get around.
[40:10.85]How about I keep an eye out for him?
[40:18.36]What a great voice.
[40:19.74]Seriously.
[40:24.91]Catch pigeons for Howard across the city.
[40:27.31]And then get your pigeon tokens.
[40:31.05]What are these for?
[40:33.57]There's so many things to do in this game.
[40:36.06]There's so many go-grab this items in this game.
[40:38.12]Oh, thank you.
[40:38.98]If you have any luck, please give me a call.
[40:46.65]Pick up this.
[40:47.35]Take a picture of that.
[40:48.97]Look at this.
[40:49.53]Look at that.
[40:49.97]This is a... Oh, hold on.
[40:53.38]Another one of these black cat things.
[40:55.94]Did I already do this one?
[41:01.82]Alright, let's, uh... Did I do this one?
[41:07.86]No.
[41:08.06]Do this.
[41:08.30]Do that.
[41:09.58]Okay.
[41:15.61]Good boys are!
[41:17.59]And she hangs up.
[41:18.79]Where is it?
[41:19.27]Felicia?
[41:39.44]Another message from Doc.
[41:40.30]Fisk Tower.
[41:41.20]Doctor?
[42:10.60]It's Jeff.
[42:11.40]Please make him the main character.
[42:12.82]Oh fuck, why did I skip this conversation with Jeff?
[42:15.23]God damn it.
[42:15.53]What the hell am I thinking?
[42:16.47]Restart.
[42:42.34]Jeff, I'm here.
[42:42.96]Here we go.
[42:44.18]What do you see?
[42:46.46]For a second, I thought it was him.
[42:48.40]Looks like the demons are moving in on Fisk's territory.
[42:50.56]Oh, I see you, Jeff.
[42:53.04]I got this.
[43:00.50]Oh, I thought I had... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[43:03.36]Okay, we're fine.
[43:09.18]I want the big ones.
[43:13.78]So, investigate the demons.
[43:17.58]Everybody behind me, right?
[43:18.30]Just this guy right here?
[43:24.99]Oh no, Spider-Man's here.
[43:29.09]Well, this guy knows.
[43:34.15]Somebody else gonna investigate?
[43:37.03]Doesn't look like it.
[43:41.81]Two?
[43:42.29]One, two?
[43:46.63]And then there's you.
[43:49.41]Okay.
[43:54.43]And just like that, it's that easy.
[44:00.24]Can I break through that?
[44:03.70]Not today.
[44:21.20]Very cool.
[44:34.18]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[44:37.73]That was a nice hurricanrana.
[44:40.27]What was the guy's name?
[44:41.59]Forget his name.
[44:48.40]Why are they puddles?
[44:49.81]Is it rain?
[44:57.77]Worst game of the year.
[44:59.03]Puddle failure?
[44:59.79]Is the audio desynced?
[45:01.29]Shouldn't be.
[45:03.51]We'll do a test to make sure.
[45:23.45]Saving bad guys from other bad guys.
[45:26.51]So you ready?
[45:33.64]Is it synced?
[45:34.82]Should be bang, bang, bang.
[45:40.18]Or is it off?
[45:42.74]Good.
[45:43.80]Okay.
[45:45.48]Not how I thought today would go.
[45:48.71]Save the remaining people.
[45:50.45]You got it.
[45:57.85]Be nice if I actually went up.
[45:59.15]Let's start at the top.
[46:01.75]You know what I'm saying?
[46:02.77]I'm going all the way to the top so I don't have to come back down.
[46:04.43]I don't have to go back up.
[46:05.93]You know what I'm trying to say.
[46:19.42]Goodbye.
[46:22.56]Whoa, I fell off the edge.
[46:29.95]That's a little bit off.
[46:39.78]Not a bad guy, okay.
[46:46.82]On the air.
[46:48.28]Alright, this is for you.
[46:53.32]You guys over here, hello.
[47:10.09]Uh-oh.
[47:12.55]It's a big guy.
[47:16.75]See?
[47:17.03]I told you it was a big guy.
[47:23.40]And let's use some gadgets.
[47:33.14]He's down, right?
[47:34.16]Ooh, lots of people here.
[47:45.01]Don't do that!
[47:45.47]Is that the only big guy?
[47:55.45]Alright, I need to rescue these people.
[48:02.31]Is there anybody on this...?
[48:04.09]No, there's not.
[48:05.51]You better swing around the outside to look for Fist's men.
[48:12.01]Swing around the outside and... Anybody down here?
[48:18.32]Yeah, there are people over here.
[48:21.32]Actually, right here!
[48:23.84]Alright.
[48:35.99]Helicopter coming up.
[48:44.49]What do I do with this?
[48:45.77]Can I handle you?
[48:46.53]Throw some shit at you?
[48:48.91]Eat boxes.
[48:49.51]Eat this.
[48:49.81]It's not doing anything.
[48:51.91]Whoa!
[48:57.84]Holy God!
[48:58.80]Okay.
[48:59.58]Throw a person at the plane.
[49:00.48]I don't know if I'll be able to handle that.
[49:23.13]That was a double tap.
[49:24.01]Alright, that's it for there.
[49:24.89]Straight ahead.
[49:25.89]Wait, no, he's still alive.
[49:27.66]Not for long.
[49:29.98]More, more, more.
[49:31.68]Alright, you're safe.
[49:34.20]I just cheered in victory.
[49:41.09]20 more.
[49:41.47]A couple more people.
[49:47.27]You too.
[49:49.53]Oh, get rid of it.
[50:02.38]One, two, three, straight down.
[50:04.38]And then again, up.
[50:06.68]And then one, two, straight down.
[50:12.36]Goodbye.
[50:14.30]Let's watch him, watch him.
[50:15.52]Where'd he go?
[50:17.01]Okay, he's alive.
[50:20.51]Uh, what's left?
[50:21.11]Anybody else here?
[50:21.75]Is somebody stuck?
[50:23.09]Up top.
[50:32.20]Climb.
[50:34.98]What are you doing?
[50:35.44]Don't pose for a camera.
[50:36.47]Get up there.
[50:44.35]He's wrapping around.
[50:45.25]Just climb the wall.
[50:51.17]That's a long ways away.
[50:52.80]Holy shit.
[50:54.38]Oh, really?
[51:01.53]Oh, really?
[51:03.65]I wanted to take no hits.
[51:11.49]See you later.
[51:13.33]You okay?
[51:19.58]No, I don't think he's okay.
[51:20.98]Fisk, your men are safe.
[51:22.82]Your turn.
[51:23.60]Who runs the demons?
[51:25.08]Shattered in half.
[51:25.82]Maybe he's there.
[51:26.56]Maybe he isn't.
[51:27.70]Check the roof.
[51:29.65]You okay?
[51:30.17]I miss these cryptic fist talks.
[51:36.23]Straight up.
[51:36.71]Hello again.
[51:58.58]Wow.
[51:58.94]Why can't I do that earlier?
[52:00.00]Nice shot.
[52:06.61]Another GTA player, yeah.
[52:13.95]Do I have to grab onto that?
[52:17.11]That would be... If that's what this mission is, then this one is also.
[52:28.29]Was I supposed to hit circle?
[52:41.06]No!
[52:41.52]Come on, Spider-Man!
[52:42.68]Save us!
[52:46.74]Can you actually nail this?
[52:56.51]Oh, Jesus.
[53:04.07]There it is.
[53:08.74]That's so cool.
[53:09.48]Why wouldn't you just cut it?
[53:10.90]Just go through the knife and splash it, man.
[53:12.94]Hurry up.
[53:13.22]Go.
[53:34.84]I really need to get that speed thing.
[53:41.17]Almost there.
[53:41.95]Rockets?
[53:43.53]Rockets?!
[53:44.93]I'm trying!
[53:45.67]I didn't get the upgrade!
[54:05.42]I would be able to get it if there's all these buildings.
[54:07.70]There we go.
[54:19.21]Did he just break it?
[54:23.05]Ah!
[54:26.43]No, get out of the way!
[54:28.49]Did I lose?
[54:29.05]No, okay, the whole thing is scripted.
[54:48.69]Imagine how many heads would just turn if in that cutscene you stood up and that thing just took off Spider-Man's head.
[54:57.48]And you played the rest of the game as Black Cat.
[55:02.08]It'd be like, what the fuck?
[55:04.38]Hi, is this the flight to Newark?
[55:09.46]That was pretty, that was pretty cheesy, but cute.
[55:16.22]Whoa, hold on a minute.
[55:17.04]Okay, I thought that was, that was weird.
[55:24.14]What am I supposed to do?
[55:25.04]I, okay, I have to tap X. I got it.
[55:29.06]Alright, one engine down.
[55:33.36]Alright, go around.
[55:39.53]Wait till he does this.
[55:40.51]Alright, now I'll do it.
[55:43.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[55:45.85]This is your master plan?
[55:47.39]Replace Fisk?
[55:48.85]That's an Xbox thing.
[55:50.56]Plan real fast.
[55:51.88]My brain.
[55:52.52]Oh, shit.
[55:54.78]I guess this is the plan.
[55:58.64]Come on, Pete.
[56:02.54]You got this.
[56:04.32]You got this.
[56:04.74]You got this.
[56:05.14]You got this.
[56:07.59]Yes!
[56:13.91]I'm just flying around on a beetle now.
[56:15.82]Alright, what's the last thing I have to do?
[56:18.02]This is it!
[56:18.52]And let's get it!
[56:44.43]You can see the flames.
[56:57.53]That was so fucked up.
[57:02.82]Why wouldn't you just get off?
[57:05.16]You just rode that into the ground.
[57:07.67]I need a plan.
[57:08.45]I need a plan real fast.
[57:09.63]There we go.
[57:11.53]Oh, shit.
[57:11.97]I was messing up again.
[57:12.87]I guess this is the plan.
[57:16.77]Alright.
[57:19.93]No, we already know what happens.
[57:21.45]You got this.
[57:22.71]You got this.
[57:23.09]You got this.
[57:26.08]You're coming down with the ship.
[57:34.40]Here we go.
[57:35.96]Please don't screw this up.
[57:44.92]Hold on, what happened?
[57:46.05]Did I have to do it faster than that?
[57:57.61]I watched this guy put down two webs and control this whole thing.
[58:02.51]You tell me I gotta shoot it like 50 times?
[58:05.72]Come on Pete, you got this.
[58:16.10]Alright, so I have to spam this.
[58:22.55]I can do that.
[58:26.09]Don't screw this up.
[58:46.00]It's not over?
[58:49.82]How do you see into those things, man?
[58:53.68]I'm sick of your bullshit, Pete.
[58:54.76]Cut him down and put him on the ground.
[59:16.64]God damn it.
[59:18.92]Oh, crap, I'm late.
[59:20.58]You coming?
[59:22.34]Nah, I gotta get to City Hall for my dad's ceremony.
[59:25.21]Wait, this is the... Tell your pops I said congrats.
[59:27.25]This is the other Spider-Man.
[59:41.14]MJ, did they start the ceremony yet?
[59:43.64]They're still setting up.
[59:44.86]Where are you?
[59:46.00]Got hung up at work.
[59:46.88]Be there soon.
[59:56.25]Symbiote Spider-Man?
[59:59.41]Wait, is that actually, like, new Spider-Man?
[60:02.25]No, is it?
[60:03.57]Oh, that's cool.
[60:06.50]That's a nice little Easter egg.
[60:13.70]Wait, how is that a spoiler?
[60:19.49]That's like saying Dick Grayson's Robin.
[60:24.33]Right?
[60:25.59]That's who Robin is.
[60:31.11]What the fuck?
[60:32.51]Unsubscribe!
[60:34.99]Don't unsubscribe me because I just gave you a spoiler.
[60:42.57]Is this what you guys do to me when I say, like, a bad joke?
[60:45.75]Or is it you, like, unsub him?
[60:49.13]I want to hear what he has to say.
[60:51.67]I want to hear his, like, live stream.
[60:56.22]Let's do this thing.
[60:57.64]I'm full of love.
[60:59.62]I call out injustice, corruption, and crimes against humanity because I adore this city.
[61:06.18]And I want it to be better.
[61:11.21]Oh, that's too bad it doesn't keep going.
[61:12.75]If you can still listen to his, like, uh, podcast while you're fighting.
[61:17.45]Oh, shit, there's a big guy here.
[61:20.73]There's a, there's a large, there's a big guy here.
[61:26.41]You heard that noise.
[61:34.35]Oh, now he's there.
[61:42.15]Can't pick up big guys yet, right?
[61:43.31]No, not yet.
[61:59.57]Knocking the ever-loving stuffing out of dealers is my anti-drug.
[62:03.78]I'm getting a lot of... I got a... A text to Yuri, and the cops are on their way.
[62:08.26]I actually have to... Let me get a picture here.
[62:12.81]What am I taking a photo of?
[62:14.07]Subject off-center.
[62:16.27]What is it?
[62:19.79]Let's see what it is.
[62:21.46]That's the bridge.
[62:30.10]Magnifique!
[62:31.94]What?
[62:36.72]Somebody got seriously injured from that photo.
[62:45.09]Magnifique!
[62:55.25]Research?
[62:56.01]Ah.
[62:57.11]Let me take a look.
[62:57.57]I've got some points to do anyway, so let's go to skills.
[63:01.74]I've got two points.
[63:03.70]I put one into here, right before I turned pretty much off the stream last night.
[63:07.78]Or off the computer.
[63:10.26]So this is the next one.
[63:11.26]When below half health, attacks generate focus faster.
[63:18.90]I want the quick zip.
[63:21.54]Zipping a second time without losing altitude.
[63:24.98]That's just so helpful.
[63:26.88]Point launch boost.
[63:28.64]Press X on contact with point to massively boost point launch distance.
[63:34.47]So you can just bang and launch off.
[63:37.27]Air yank.
[63:38.47]Quick recovery.
[63:44.75]Research is fun and short.
[63:46.05]What's wrong with you?
[63:49.54]I mean, I didn't say that it wasn't fun.
[63:51.10]It just... I don't really want to do it.
[63:55.32]Perch takedown.
[63:56.23]What's the next one here?
[63:57.75]Stealth takedowns do more focus.
[64:00.05]Can yank heavy weapons.
[64:06.47]Ground strike, last stand...
[64:15.42]Who's the big guy?
[64:16.70]Brute enemies can be grabbed and thrown.
[64:17.94]Yeah, I can't do that yet, though.
[64:20.52]We have to go down here.
[64:21.82]So now I get the moment where I can spin him around in a circle.
[64:23.94]If I tap triangle.
[64:27.52]That's cool.
[64:28.08]Okay.
[64:29.48]Alright, we got some gadget stuff here.
[64:31.16]Electric web.
[64:32.02]I can do some upgrades, I think.
[64:34.28]I have to craft this.
[64:35.24]No base token.
[64:37.08]Challenge tokens.
[64:40.13]I can upgrade the impact web.
[64:44.18]Let's knock enemies further back.
[64:47.20]I can do this too.
[64:48.76]Adds two shots to the web shooter.
[64:50.28]Here's the electric one.
[64:55.13]Increase maximum shots for this gadget.
[64:57.25]I'll get this.
[64:59.51]Might as well.
[65:00.41]This one's not going to be able to be used for a while anyways.
[65:02.35]And then we'll do this one too.
[65:07.04]Last one is increase time enemies stay webbed.
[65:11.63]This one.
[65:11.97]I need two more crime tokens to be able to do that one.
[65:16.50]That's good.
[65:17.12]This one is maximum stu... I can't even make this one yet.
[65:21.68]Alright, that's fine.
[65:23.76]Suits!
[65:24.71]New suit!
[65:25.35]Ooh, what's this weird negative one?
[65:29.23]Negative suit.
[65:32.61]Synchronizes nanomesh particles to unleash a devastating wave of negative energy.
[65:39.97]This is actually an eyestrain suit.
[65:42.29]You're right.
[65:44.47]Electrically insulated suit.
[65:47.71]Kit bashed high discharge capacitors temporarily electrify gauntlets, electrifying enemies.
[65:55.40]Okay.
[65:56.60]Cool.
[65:59.12]Keep this one on for now.
[66:00.10]What's this one?
[66:02.40]No associated suit powder.
[66:04.94]Complete all black cat stakeouts to unlock this suit.
[66:10.29]I'll stick with this one.
[66:11.21]But I have some mods, though.
[66:13.87]Let's see.
[66:16.27]Reduces the effect of flashbangs and stun grenades.
[66:19.31]That's pretty effective.
[66:20.79]Web attacks generate more focus.
[66:26.91]What about... Yeah, that's fine.
[66:30.43]I'll just keep this.
[66:34.53]I need crime tokens, so might as well get them.
[66:40.17]Why not?
[66:40.71]It's right here.
[66:42.87]And-
[66:52.87]I want to try this. No I want to try it. I want to try the fun thing.
[67:09.41]Maybe they didn't have guns.
[67:10.63]That was a rocket launcher.
[67:20.10]You gotta go, dude.
[67:31.87]Aerial combo.
[67:32.81]What the fuck?
[67:34.65]What?
[67:40.92]That guy was bored.
[67:41.84]Dammit.
[67:48.96]He was calling his mom.
[67:52.09]Only one crime token?
[67:54.03]Amateur.
[67:54.55]Come on, Jeremy.
[67:55.09]I think those are bad guys, but whatever.
[68:10.44]I'm so glad I have this ability now.
[68:19.24]Press X to fly faster.
[68:21.92]I also have fast travel too, but I don't think I'm... I'm not sick of doing this yet.
[68:25.84]Oh, where is it?
[68:29.08]Right here in front of me?
[68:39.32]No, I want to do it.
[68:40.08]There's tons of people around here.
[68:41.68]Oh, come on.
[68:42.16]Let me do it.
[68:42.88]No, you asshole.
[68:44.11]Motherfuckers.
[69:11.38]Mom?
[69:11.80]What do you mean, mom?
[69:13.44]Oh, fuck.
[69:15.32]Give me the web.
[69:18.72]This way.
[69:19.74]Mm-hmm.
[69:20.74]Oh, somebody's stuck in the truck.
[69:47.27]I ain't gonna fail that.
[69:52.11]I was looking at chat.
[69:56.24]What did I do?
[69:59.32]What did I do?
[70:01.02]What did I do?
[70:01.70]What did I say?
[70:02.56]Why is everybody so quiet?
[70:03.42]What did I say?
[70:16.36]What are you guys doing?
[70:22.26]No, I didn't make it.
[70:23.16]The slide, uh, the rope wasn't long enough.
[70:32.62]I'm not doing tricks.
[70:35.16]That's a mistake.
[70:35.86]10-30, robbery in progress.
[70:40.26]Suspect armed.
[70:41.74]Local officers, please converge on...
[70:49.31]You might have heard about the robbery at Rosemar's auction house.
[70:52.13]What you probably didn't, but my sources confirm.
[71:03.30]Oh, wait.
[71:04.00]Somebody's spamming?
[71:09.98]There's a bunch of spam bots.
[71:12.69]Oh.
[71:12.83]Sounds like a lot of people out there.
[71:19.44]You'll be fine, honey.
[71:20.66]Last time I gave a speech, I was in high school.
[71:25.00]Just ask the guy nicely to stop spamming.
[71:27.52]That's all you have to do.
[71:28.98]If only Miss Steinberg could see you now.
[71:31.61]Hey, you got this, Dad.
[71:33.63]I mean, come on, you saved Spider-Man.
[71:35.15]I'm pretty sure that makes you an official superhero.
[71:38.07]A superhero?
[71:40.67]Or maybe I'm just a guy who doesn't give up.
[71:49.28]That was a loud sip.
[71:51.60]Was it?
[71:51.94]It was really close to the mic here, right?
[71:54.28]How am I out of coffee already?
[71:57.00]This was a large.
[71:58.20]What's wrong with me?
[71:58.92]I'm such a fucking fiend.
[71:59.58]Welcome, everyone.
[72:00.54]Before I hand it off to Mayor Osborne, I'd just like to say a few words.
[72:06.08]So?
[72:08.37]I think this gang war may finally be over.
[72:11.63]Like, over, over?
[72:13.63]So, Norman Osborne is the mayor.
[72:15.03]There's some loose ends still to be tied up, but... Loose ends.
[72:18.85]Well, a truck pulled away from the scene from a company called Consolidated Shipping.
[72:24.67]Something's not right about it.
[72:25.70]I just don't know what.
[72:29.32]Well, maybe after this we can grab some coffee.
[72:31.40]Figure it out together.
[72:32.26]You know, I'm something of a mayor myself.
[72:34.58]Well, thanks, Jim.
[72:35.58]Couldn't have said it better myself, but I'll try.
[72:42.23]We all know that Officer Davis is a hero.
[72:46.54]But, uh, instead of coffee, maybe we could have dinner instead.
[72:51.34]I could come over, I'll cook.
[72:55.80]Or we could, you know, meet at a totally neutral location for a completely normal meal cooked by professionals.
[73:04.95]For acts of extraordinary bravery.
[73:08.62]...above and beyond the Call of Duty... ...it is my privilege to present... ...Officer Jefferson Davis... ...with a Department... ...Metal of Honor.
[73:19.77]Phone call, sir.
[73:20.49]Kind of in the middle of something here, Jim.
[73:22.27]Sounds urgent, sir.
[73:23.53]Fine.
[73:25.85]Congratulations, sir.
[73:36.32]Thank you... ...Mr. Mayor.
[73:40.26]I share this honor with my family.
[73:43.20]My wife, Rio, and my son, Miles.
[73:47.52]Without their support, I couldn't do what I do.
[73:52.27]I've worked many years for this moment.
[73:55.35]Who is this?
[73:57.47]Over the coming days, your company, your city, and everything you care about will be destroyed.
[74:04.27]People will beg you for help, but you won't be able to save them.
[74:10.03]Listen, jackass.
[74:11.51]I get threats like this twice a week.
[74:13.55]Why don't you grow a pair and tell me what you want?
[74:16.06]To watch you suffer.
[74:26.77]Is this the... Uh-oh.
[74:31.97]Not good.
[74:34.65]Who the fuck is that?
[74:50.54]What the hell?
[75:01.09]Oh, what the fuck?
[75:02.05]No!
[75:06.12]No!
[75:29.11]So, without spoilers or anything, is this the... I'm just going to say it's Dark Reign.
[75:34.91]Is this like the Dark Reign kind of world here?
[75:40.01]Are we going to get a Dark Reign Osborn?
[75:41.47]Well, I hope so.
[75:53.27]that's all new story am I actually playing wait I'm playing as miles now can you hear me baby stay here I'm going to find your father Peter Peter wake up come on say something please
[76:30.99]Jesus Christ.
[76:31.39]I was supposed to go over here.
[76:33.03]Through the...debris?
[77:07.46]So, in this storyline, Osborn never became the Goblin.
[77:13.06]I see.
[77:16.88]Because the Dark Reign Osborn is, like, one of my favorite characters I could possibly think of.
[77:36.69]Obviously, without talking about why, this isn't interesting to me.
[77:39.24]Miles!
[77:39.86]Miles!
[77:40.14]Miles!
[77:41.26]Are you okay?
[77:45.20]Nice going, kid.
[77:48.24]Are you okay?
[77:50.27]Yeah.
[77:50.99]Yes.
[77:51.21]Yes.
[77:51.43]Yes.
[77:51.79]Are you?
[77:52.39]Are you okay?
[77:55.31]I'm alright, man.
[77:57.65]I'm alright.
[77:58.85]You sure you're okay?
[78:00.89]Alright, so where are we going from here?
[78:06.07]Can't go through the fire over here, so let's try going this way.
[78:12.07]Wait, what does that say?
[78:12.91]Oh, I guess I can go up here.
[78:36.18]That's alive I know it I just jump from here It was right there
[79:13.15]There's gotta be something I can do here, right?
[79:18.32]Oh, well, I just did it.
[79:20.75]Not yet.
[79:45.71]I shouldn't be going right now.
[79:46.79]I should not be going right now.
[79:47.89]I should not have gone.
[79:48.71]I should not have done that.
[79:49.75]I should not have done that.
[79:51.26]I shouldn't have done that.
[79:53.12]I shouldn't have done that.
[79:53.90]Better find a way around these guys.
[80:02.32]Can't cross yet.
[80:13.12]Go, go, go, go, go.
[80:13.92]Okay, we're good.
[80:19.50]We can go... watch out for this dude.
[80:38.08]Is there any other way I can go?
[80:38.98]Do I have to cross over here?
[80:41.08]Alright, where's the end game here?
[80:42.92]This way or that way?
[80:46.03]What the hell was that?
[80:56.41]Did I just make a bunch of noise?
[80:57.69]Do I go up and run up and snap this guy's neck?
[81:04.96]Okay.
[81:05.44]Okay.
[81:20.83]So he is the bad guy.
[81:30.98]I told you.
[81:33.31]I told you I should have taken that handkerchief out and blew my fucking nose in it and put it back.
[81:54.82]No, wait.
[81:55.20]Don't kill that guy.
[81:55.94]We're gonna be late.
[81:56.84]This is terrible.
[81:59.87]This is, like, horrible.
[82:04.21]This game took, like, a really dark turn here.
[83:24.25]Is that Peter Parker right there?
[83:25.13]Yeah.
[83:29.05]I'm sorry for your loss.
[83:32.37]Do I know you?
[83:34.68]I'm Peter Parker.
[83:36.58]I was at City Hall when.
[83:39.40]Look, I know you don't know me, but I just wanted to say I know you're going through.
[83:49.12]That's what you were going to say, right?
[83:54.05]Or it all gets easier with time.
[83:56.93]Or don't worry.
[84:00.11]It's part of God's plan.
[84:04.17]I'm sorry.
[84:04.97]I was just trying to help.
[84:08.52]I know.
[84:15.82]I'm sorry about that.
[84:19.09]I don't know what I'm going to do with him.
[84:29.69]Damn.
[84:43.86]Well, that was... That was definitely... That was definitely pretty heavy.
[84:59.95]We were just swinging around, uh, fighting criminals and then... There that is, right?
[85:08.53]Looking for more towers?
[85:09.45]There's one right here!
[85:11.39]Solid evidence!
[85:12.07]How about, uh, I watched his eyes turn bright silver?
[85:28.06]I'm thinking I screwed up, and that kid lost his father.
[85:31.36]I know you too well to say you should give yourself a break.
[85:34.96]What about the police?
[85:36.20]Do they have any leads on Lee?
[85:37.92]I'm not even looking for him.
[85:39.11]Even Yuri doesn't believe me.
[85:41.81]Then it's up to us to find him.
[85:43.99]I've been doing some research.
[85:45.67]Go to this address.
[85:47.19]Martin Lee bought a controlling interest in this recycling center last year.
[85:51.39]You think he's hiding out there?
[85:53.23]Maybe.
[85:54.29]We know he's not at Feast.
[85:55.89]If he's not at the recycling center, maybe you'll find some evidence as to where he might be.
[86:00.32]Yeah.
[86:01.34]Good work, MJ.
[86:02.64]I'll let you know what I find.
[86:04.48]Oh, one more thing.
[86:05.92]I talked to the detective about questioning the arrested demons.
[86:09.06]They're all claiming Martin Lee has the power to, quote, corrupt people.
[86:13.83]Corrupt?
[86:14.31]What does that mean?
[86:16.23]Wish I knew who made this comic about me.
[86:18.15]Kid's got a future.
[86:21.70]Actual children's drawings, by the way.
[86:25.33]Hey, MJ.
[86:26.31]Did you learn anything else about Martin Li?
[86:30.21]No, he already said that.
[86:31.07]She has a point.
[86:31.69]Okay, um, how far away is that tower?
[87:00.07]There's something just right here.
[87:03.41]Would you look at that?
[87:04.67]Half the crime towers back up already.
[87:07.01]When Spider Cop's on the job, come hell or high water, the job gets.
[87:12.21]Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[87:14.23]She'd never admit it, but the chief was warming up to Spider Cop.
[87:18.85]His casual disregard for by the book thinking was a breath of fresh air.
[87:23.67]She'd come around someday.
[87:27.89]He's doing the gamer voice.
[87:29.29]He's doing the gamer voice.
[87:43.57]Even the game recognizes it.
[87:46.66]Alright, let's get... Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[87:48.76]There's a base right there.
[87:50.60]I'm gonna go do this.
[87:53.94]I need a base token.
[87:54.66]I need a couple of them.
[87:59.64]Let's do it.
[88:01.24]Ten air launches.
[88:01.96]Whoa, who's shooting at me here?
[88:03.12]One, two.
[88:03.44]I don't even have this arm.
[88:05.20]In the face.
[88:36.40]And back at you again.
[88:37.26]And let's do it again.
[88:46.13]I love that move.
[88:46.65]That's my favorite move.
[88:54.53]Why'd I pick that up?
[88:55.17]Well, that's why.
[89:03.92]Where are you?
[89:04.26]Where you are?
[89:04.94]Let's go ahead and do it.
[89:18.38]One more of those.
[89:22.46]Aww, what the heck.
[89:24.08]Alright, now that was awesome because of the explosion.
[89:36.77]Where'd he go?
[89:37.17]Did he fall off?
[89:44.35]Last few people over there.
[89:46.03]Oh, that was a botched job.
[89:51.07]Oh, come on.
[89:58.41]Don't grab the guy with the fucking grenade launcher.
[90:11.42]Play comers, that's a lot of tardy slips.
[90:13.76]I'm gonna have to write wave three of six Nice Exactly what I planned
[90:46.03]One, two, three, four, hi-yah!
[90:49.57]Damn it.
[90:50.19]The physics are really annoying.
[90:56.44]Wait, I think the physics are amazing.
[91:15.06]Uh, a little busy.
[91:15.66]Oh shit.
[91:16.06]Alright, you gotta go.
[91:17.52]You're causing a huge problem.
[91:19.68]Wait, what?
[91:20.26]What?
[91:20.98]Is he dead?
[91:43.36]I want... Let's throw a grenade down there.
[91:45.54]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[91:52.23]Fuck.
[91:53.51]He's grabbed, right?
[91:54.15]Yeah.
[91:54.55]Okay.
[92:12.98]Hello?
[92:13.46]Where are you?
[92:13.87]Hello?
[92:14.09]These missions last a long time, huh?
[92:42.61]Holy shit.
[92:43.37]Okay, I gotta slide underneath this dude.
[92:44.61]Final wave!
[92:53.13]Almost done.
[93:13.42]and grab him into the wall spider-man doesn't wear shoes how does he get how does he get around damn it I'm trying to grab him
[93:40.19]Up there.
[93:43.10]Oh, yes.
[93:43.96]That one felt great.
[93:47.06]He's not done yet.
[93:55.82]Nope.
[93:57.64]Let's grab this guy.
[94:16.01]One more guy.
[94:16.69]Two more.
[94:16.97]No, no, no.
[94:17.27]This guy needs to go.
[94:18.43]Spin around.
[94:19.09]Into the other guy.
[94:19.75]Off the cliff.
[94:20.37]Game over.
[94:24.11]That was fun.
[94:28.76]How many base tokens do I get?
[94:29.78]When I say this is game, it's game of the year worthy.
[94:32.18]Yes.
[94:32.26]I couldn't disarm anybody.
[94:33.28]I don't have it.
[94:47.67]I absolutely would.
[94:51.43]There's enough content here to last a long time.
[94:54.15]Story is progressing.
[94:59.73]If you like to just beat people up, swing around and be Spider-Man, this is the game you should buy.
[95:10.62]For sure.
[95:11.04]I think I hear thunder.
[95:13.96]Is it thundering?
[95:18.26]I lost control of the character for a second.
[95:19.78]I'm like, wait a minute.
[95:20.50]Hold on.
[95:20.78]Did I just die in a pond?
[95:22.00]This is the first time we've seen weather too, right?
[95:34.71]Somebody just said the weather's cool.
[95:35.95]Hey, we're running another piece on Jefferson Davis and it made me wonder, how's the set miles doing?
[95:42.35]Not good.
[95:43.71]I've been there.
[95:44.95]The loss is all you can think about.
[95:47.35]He needs something to do outside of school.
[95:49.99]Maybe a part-time job?
[95:51.57]It's not a bad idea, but it has to be the right job.
[95:55.39]Something that makes him feel useful.
[95:56.99]Like what he's doing matters.
[95:58.83]Kind of think you just described... Face?
[96:01.47]MJ, that's perfect.
[96:03.28]I'll talk to Mae about it.
[96:05.18]That's what I'm here for.
[96:06.94]Speed.
[96:07.52]One of Howard's pigeons.
[96:11.82]Pigeon?
[96:12.34]A pigeon!
[96:13.32]He's a fast one with no strength.
[96:14.28]He's not.
[96:17.07]What, I gotta track the pigeon down?
[96:18.63]How do I get him?
[96:25.35]How do I grab him?
[96:27.73]No!
[96:28.95]Oh, shit.
[96:29.85]Go, go, go, go, go.
[96:30.45]Come on.
[96:30.83]I have to be up higher.
[96:34.00]Oh, get out of the way.
[96:41.52]Here we go.
[96:50.20]Chasing around a goddamn bird.
[97:00.05]It's L1 and R1.
[97:00.71]I thought it was gonna be triangle.
[97:02.39]Oh, come on.
[97:03.39]It's triangle for every other scenario.
[97:07.31]Oh, god damn it.
[97:11.44]What's gotten there?
[97:16.86]It was just triangle.
[97:18.74]Triangle.
[97:20.37]That's pretty vile.
[97:21.81]This was kind of unnecessarily vile.
[97:24.95]Well, how else are you gonna get it?
[97:25.99]What's this area that you're gonna have to... I mean... You don't have, like, a bird vacuum or anything like that.
[97:48.49]Alright, swoop down.
[97:51.63]Hello.
[97:51.93]Is he stuffing him down his panties?
[97:56.65]His suit is zipped up.
[97:57.49]Alright, well, I don't have any more of those.
[98:21.19]They didn't hear that, right?
[98:22.03]Good.
[98:25.58]I want these.
[98:26.14]That's it for over here, right?
[98:39.08]One guy that way.
[98:39.78]See you later.
[98:44.89]Got ten of these.
[98:45.55]Oh, here we go.
[99:08.12]now investigate okay that's all of them I shouldn't have jumped down clap that was wonderful security lock they use these on banks not recycling centers oh wait a minute this is gonna be the pipe dream thing maybe if I can find where it gets its power from that way
[99:37.00]Right here.
[99:37.50]Yep.
[99:39.46]Here we go.
[99:39.94]Oh, never mind.
[99:40.42]Need more.
[99:41.10]Okay.
[99:41.28]Can I shoot this one?
[99:42.24]No.
[99:42.30]It's just, they're everywhere.
[100:04.50]Gotta find a junction box.
[100:06.54]It's right here, dude.
[100:08.02]I can see it.
[100:10.56]Zap it or is it already?
[100:11.38]Yep.
[100:12.60]There.
[100:14.10]Looks like the circuit's still stable.
[100:16.26]Maybe there's another junction box close by.
[100:17.96]Fuck.
[100:27.15]No?
[100:27.93]It's the other one.
[100:29.69]Gotcha.
[100:31.33]There's one right here.
[100:32.61]One more box should do it.
[100:34.09]Mm-hmm.
[100:36.56]Hmm, I wonder where it is.
[100:44.32]The REAL green gobble.
[100:49.03]Could be, actually.
[100:49.75]Glad that you mentioned it.
[100:53.93]Investigate the building.
[100:55.95]Any more pigeons?
[101:06.18]I mean, I know it's not a pigeon, but still.
[101:08.24]Let's go.
[101:16.77]Mm-hmm.
[101:19.37]And I'm in.
[101:21.13]Oh, man.
[101:21.93]What do I have to do here?
[101:24.97]Oh, no.
[101:25.39]It's a puzzle.
[101:26.39]I have to go.
[101:27.03]This must be where they're planning to attack.
[101:28.81]Wait.
[101:30.01]These are Osborne campaign offices.
[101:33.34]All the paths originate from the same address.
[101:36.52]Lots of high-tech equipment.
[101:38.22]Maybe later I can recycle this stuff into some weapons of my own.
[101:41.28]Can I take it?
[101:43.63]Apparently not.
[101:47.43]Guns from Fisk's armory.
[101:50.99]Cool.
[101:51.97]We gotta get all the lore.
[101:53.83]Truck bombs?
[101:54.95]This is crazy.
[101:58.33]Destroy them, Peter.
[102:03.34]Explosives from Fisk's construction site.
[102:06.36]This wasn't a gang war.
[102:08.40]The demons were stealing from Fisk to go after Mayor Osborn.
[102:12.68]Hey, did you find Lee?
[102:14.16]No, but you were right.
[102:16.18]Lee's using this place as a front for the demons.
[102:18.48]Bomb making, gun running.
[102:19.68]Oh my god.
[102:21.98]And it looks like they're planning another attack.
[102:24.28]This time on Norman Osborn's campaign offices.
[102:27.28]We must have some kind of beef with Norman Osborn.
[102:29.84]I found an address here.
[102:31.31]I think it's their staging area.
[102:34.17]I don't know why I was doing that.
[102:37.07]Wow, that's far away.
[102:38.19]That's 2,000 miles away.
[102:41.75]1, 2, 3, 4, 5 demons.
[102:43.91]I gotta go off the Empire State where you can do as many backflips as you can.
[102:46.76]I gotta get like 10 backflips.
[103:03.15]Well, uh, no I won't.
[103:13.71]I could give you a recommendation, though.
[103:17.14]That'd be quite the recommendation.
[103:23.22]Yeah, here's Spider-Man's cell phone number.
[103:24.88]You gonna turn that guy down?
[103:35.38]Almost there.
[103:45.08]That's a goal.
[103:52.11]So much fun.
[103:54.29]I was going to say fun, and then I just ruined it.
[104:13.29]run run jump there it is alright let's see what happens how long am I going to stream for same as I did last night like four or five hours consolidated shipping a lot of guys I should try to do this quietly I didn't say 24 I said four or five
[104:40.91]Consolidated shipping.
[104:44.70]You can now craft a tripmine!
[104:50.92]Laser-activated web trap that instantly incapacitates enemies.
[104:56.10]Okay.
[104:58.94]Can I afford this?
[104:59.48]Oh, yeah.
[105:01.28]I like this.
[105:01.76]I like the impact web the most.
[105:05.81]I'm gonna just... Oh, just get it.
[105:08.87]Can't just not get it.
[105:09.57]You deploy a spider drone, which will seek out and fire energy blasters at nearby enemies.
[105:12.49]That's kind of cool.
[105:16.00]I can't make that.
[105:18.00]I can upgrade them.
[105:18.68]No, I can't.
[105:19.12]I have to pee, though, really bad.
[105:22.58]So let me just go pee.
[105:24.23]I'll be right back.
[108:38.80]I'm back.
[108:43.28]I got locked in the bathroom.
[108:48.54]The bathroom door here has a problem though sometimes where it'll just lock itself when the door closes.
[108:54.10]It's one of those push button locks and you have to scramble around to find a pin or a paper clip to stick in that hole and pop it out.
[109:05.31]It's a real pain in the ass, especially if you have to use the bathroom.
[109:08.57]Sometimes I just really just want to go to the bathroom and... Oh, the door's locked.
[109:12.09]Time to spend 15 minutes popping the lockout with a pin.
[109:16.48]Really have diarrhea right now.
[109:20.92]Future stream joke, huh?
[109:29.81]Alrighty, so... This wants me to use...
[109:35.80]The trip mine.
[109:39.02]It's teaching me how... Is it just straight ahead?
[109:46.84]Yes.
[109:47.52]That's very cool.
[109:48.98]So, does it... Does it go across the whole thing?
[109:53.34]I'm curious.
[109:54.26]I mean, I guess it just... It doesn't go that far, but it does.
[109:58.75]Can I do it in the air?
[110:01.75]Wait.
[110:02.05]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[110:04.45]I can get it.
[110:12.42]Just walk over there.
[110:13.30]Just take a step to your left.
[110:19.28]Take a step to your left.
[110:23.80]Come on.
[110:24.40]Oh, oh, oh, God.
[110:31.40]Really?
[110:35.90]No, I didn't even get it.
[110:40.80]He took too long.
[110:45.57]Are there snipers here?
[110:48.19]Can I get them all on that one side?
[110:49.68]This is just a person magnet.
[110:56.88]Alright, I'm gonna lure these guys.
[110:59.48]In the roof.
[111:05.93]Can I get ten people on here?
[111:07.31]I don't wanna wait too long.
[111:11.83]This is gonna take too long.
[111:21.63]Didn't even need to do that, but I just, you know, felt like it.
[111:24.64]There we go.
[111:26.52]Impact web.
[111:27.10]My favorite.
[111:29.74]Sniper up top.
[111:31.04]Okay.
[111:34.12]And there are a few people.
[111:34.92]I'm gonna go around this side.
[111:42.59]This is safer.
[111:44.49]Two people.
[111:45.05]They're gonna see me, aren't they?
[111:49.48]Maybe they will.
[111:50.56]We'll find out.
[111:53.46]He just got out of sight.
[111:57.04]Turn around.
[111:58.66]Turn around.
[112:01.28]Just jump off.
[112:03.10]Just stealth him.
[112:08.09]People say Spider-Man's weak, but that's like the fourth time you've seen him do that.
[112:10.85]Oh, fuck.
[112:23.63]Okay.
[112:24.33]One more guy on the side.
[112:25.29]I think I can just web this sniper.
[112:27.93]I don't think I have to worry about... He's like right below me.
[112:33.13]He's right here.
[112:34.69]I don't need to web him.
[112:35.31]Let's just go like this.
[112:39.47]And that's it for snipers.
[112:41.03]And this is how we're going to do this.
[113:12.28]The power bar is full.
[113:15.16]Let's go to default.
[113:19.74]Get in the trash!
[113:21.43]Okay.
[113:21.53]Use my ult?
[113:23.91]I didn't really need it.
[113:25.81]There was not very many people.
[113:43.55]I'm on a new suit, too.
[113:47.38]I think it's time to put a new suit on.
[113:49.76]Pale horse rides.
[113:52.94]That's one expensive tune-up.
[113:54.42]Pale horse rides.
[113:55.60]What else can I find around here?
[113:57.20]1.8 million dollars.
[114:01.27]Oh, by the way, you'll think this is funny.
[114:03.97]The 1.8 just made me laugh.
[114:06.43]So, I called Comcast today.
[114:10.17]And I talked to them.
[114:11.15]They have bases all around the city.
[114:12.01]Because anyone's trying to cancel my business line.
[114:15.56]And the thing about canceling a business line with Comcast is good luck because you have to pay a fee.
[114:23.60]You have to pay 75% of the remainder of your bill.
[114:27.65]Whatever the contract was.
[114:29.97]So unless you can prove to them that the address that you're moving to does not have Comcast.
[114:40.89]So it was gonna be $1,800 for me to cancel Comcast.
[114:48.98]Unless I could prove to them with like an address and an agreement with my name on it with a utility bill that I live in this other place now.
[114:59.23]How fucking crazy is that?
[115:02.35]Because, well, you had a contract with us that was expiring in 2019.
[115:07.82]But you know what?
[115:08.81]We'll waive the $2,000 fee because we're good.
[115:12.23]We're good guys.
[115:13.93]Holy shit.
[115:16.50]It was ridiculous.
[115:19.44]So this is a demon hideouts.
[115:21.43]What do you get for doing these?
[115:22.71]I don't know.
[115:25.09]Contract for a service?
[115:29.11]That doesn't work.
[115:30.19]Yeah.
[115:31.29]Oh, by the way, I got a thing that said, how likely are you to recommend Comcast?
[115:36.72]I put down, definitely not.
[115:40.04]So yeah, take that, right?
[115:41.80]I got him there.
[115:42.56]This guy has a different weapon.
[115:46.40]Use throwables on whip enemies to stun them.
[115:53.51]Avoid air combat when fighting them, okay?
[115:56.17]I wonder why that is.
[115:59.47]Because they can whip you in the air.
[116:01.01]Who knows?
[116:01.51]So don't take him in the air.
[116:08.62]Got it.
[116:09.18]Whip demon?
[116:10.42]Oh shit, more demons!
[116:19.42]No, I want to pull this guy.
[116:22.85]The guy that's covered in the... Oh, hello.
[116:26.47]Shit, the guy has a laser beam.
[116:52.01]Holy shit, this guy's doing all kinds of moves.
[116:55.29]Let's go ahead and pull out the electric.
[116:57.27]You guys have grouped up pretty well here.
[116:59.55]Anybody else?
[117:03.50]One, two, three.
[117:24.22]Later, sucker!
[117:28.66]Have I used the suit power before?
[117:29.92]Yeah, I have.
[117:30.78]I'm just not... I don't know why I'm not using it.
[117:35.26]The drones that come out.
[117:39.92]Copy, Silverbird.
[117:40.86]We're descending to location.
[117:43.37]There's another one.
[117:45.81]You wanna play Monopoly sometime?
[117:47.29]I'll let you play this with Thimble.
[117:48.91]Well, this is new.
[117:49.61]I don't wanna play this with Thimble.
[117:50.71]Thimble's the worst piece.
[117:54.82]I wanna play as the wheelbarrow of dog.
[117:56.72]The wheelbarrow's the best one.
[117:57.70]Who are these people?
[117:58.98]What's Team Halo doing here?
[118:00.64]It's a crisis.
[118:25.58]Master Chief?
[118:38.63]Who is this?
[118:39.75]Nice entrance.
[118:40.81]Solid 8 out of 10.
[118:41.55]Come on.
[118:47.17]Where's Norman Osborn?
[118:48.41]Come save me, Norman!
[118:49.43]9 out of 10.
[118:54.17]Release him.
[118:55.11]He works with us.
[119:03.31]Yuri, explanation, please.
[119:06.31]This is Silver Sablinova, head of Sable International, a private security force.
[119:12.06]Paid for by Mayor Osborne.
[119:13.88]Oh, come on.
[119:14.68]Oh, the mayor has a pet army now?
[119:16.80]Next time you get in my way, I will not be so gentle.
[119:20.96]Go.
[119:21.60]Russian?
[119:22.24]We'll talk later.
[119:23.82]Hydrate.
[119:24.24]I have Drake in front of me.
[119:25.62]I'm good.
[119:34.37]Dual purpose.
[119:35.91]Complete.
[119:38.61]Got some points.
[119:39.51]Russian Comcast lady?
[119:40.65]What?
[119:40.75]We have to hear you hydrate.
[119:41.39]Okay.
[119:52.20]You hear the glass?
[119:52.68]There's ice in there.
[119:53.42]You hear that?
[119:53.78]New suits!
[119:54.10]Hey, guys!
[119:54.46]New suits!
[120:14.64]No, we don't.
[120:14.96]We don't have any new suits.
[120:15.76]Who lied to me?
[120:16.56]There's nothing here.
[120:17.30]Let's see.
[120:17.80]I think I want a different suit.
[120:18.58]Should I put on the dumb one?
[120:19.46]This one's kind of cool.
[120:46.25]No, it's not, though.
[120:47.13]It really isn't.
[120:53.67]I don't... The power.
[120:54.73]I guess you can just change the power.
[120:59.59]So, am I missing something here?
[121:03.46]In the bottom right, there's defense, offense, stealth, and traversal.
[121:07.84]Is there a reason why... Are they all the same here?
[121:11.04]Am I missing something here?
[121:19.04]Pick the camo one?
[121:19.90]Which one is that?
[121:21.88]There's no actual stats.
[121:23.15]Okay.
[121:24.03]They're just based on your power.
[121:25.25]Okay.
[121:27.17]Those are just the suit mods.
[121:28.19]Oh, I understand.
[121:28.75]Okay.
[121:29.03]I didn't know if suits had a base as well.
[121:31.77]Let's try it.
[121:33.35]Right?
[121:33.55]That's cool.
[121:36.65]I mean, this is just... You just went to the superfan website and bought a black suit and then put painter's tape all over yourself.
[121:45.04]This is a shitty cheap Halloween costume, but I'm gonna get it.
[121:53.33]EMP.
[121:55.71]We have new mods, though.
[121:59.54]Okay.
[122:00.32]So, scanned enemies remain highlighted until combat starts.
[122:03.54]That's alright.
[122:05.70]Increase the amount you are healed from focus.
[122:10.76]Hmm.
[122:14.44]Right into the AR scanner.
[122:19.06]More XP.
[122:20.08]Perfect dodge increases.
[122:21.54]Yeah, I got it already.
[122:29.10]I haven't changed any of these.
[122:31.82]I feel like they... I don't want to take them off.
[122:39.16]Maybe I'll take off the... Bocus one.
[122:43.51]Dumb suit.
[122:44.71]I just bought it.
[122:45.23]We have to use it for a little while.
[122:48.19]Let's see what the suit power does.
[122:51.50]So it's just... It's a giant AoE stun.
[122:54.80]That's pretty useful.
[123:00.21]You know, you can mix suits.
[123:01.07]Yeah, I know you can mix suits and powers.
[123:03.11]But I kind of need to see what it does.
[123:05.39]I want to use it at least once.
[123:10.35]I really don't like the jelly on the back.
[123:13.37]Actually, yeah, I do.
[123:17.59]I like this now.
[123:18.29]Attention agents in Hudson Town.
[123:21.08]I really do like the painter's tape suit now.
[123:23.44]This is awesome.
[123:24.30]I'm never taking it off for the rest of the time you see me play the game.
[123:27.96]What the hell am I doing?
[123:29.84]What the fuck am I doing?
[123:31.28]I'm just gonna walk up here and click, click, click.
[124:04.86]Nice toss.
[124:06.14]He's gone and... That guy did not get attached to a building.
[124:27.28]I didn't air throw that guy.
[124:28.54]Oh well.
[124:34.36]Let's go.
[124:36.78]Let's go.
[124:37.36]The EMP is actually pretty useful.
[124:51.27]Backpack.
[124:55.28]Right there.
[125:00.50]What the fuck?
[125:04.33]Gave me the idea to add insulation to my costume.
[125:07.09]Which saved me a bacon more than once.
[125:09.65]Electrician's gloves.
[125:12.05]Backpack received.
[125:14.44]I'll get some more crime tokens, why not?
[125:18.16]Is it on top of the building?
[125:25.00]It's on top of the building, isn't it?
[125:26.38]Yeah.
[125:36.53]All this for little old me?
[125:43.97]Well, I got three.
[125:46.37]Aw, dammit.
[125:49.77]Even more swing kicks.
[126:18.04]Do not shoot me.
[126:21.58]Yep.
[126:24.90]One more.
[126:26.28]Good again.
[126:27.70]One more.
[126:30.38]Holy fuck, that hit me direct.
[126:31.54]That was a direct hit with that rocket.
[126:32.94]It just scrambled my brain.
[126:43.46]There it is.
[126:43.98]Good.
[126:44.86]All bonuses.
[126:45.32]Hachi.
[127:05.42]Is this guy gonna actually even fucking kill me, dude?
[127:15.72]Take a picture of that building.
[127:16.62]Whew, that was a workout.
[127:18.77]This one right here, right?
[127:21.87]Yep.
[127:22.05]I'm not sure what it is, though.
[127:22.91]Where is it?
[127:23.23]Is it this?
[127:27.19]Cool window, but I always get the feeling something strange is going on in that place.
[127:34.05]Direct hit users.
[127:36.65]That was such a fun item.
[127:37.83]It really was.
[127:40.21]Web four enemies to walls.
[127:43.78]I can do that.
[127:44.42]Ready, here we go.
[127:45.78]Check it.
[127:46.12]Oh!
[127:59.39]Three!
[128:00.12]Almost, four more.
[128:03.36]No, fight this one.
[128:07.44]Use air launch on four enemies.
[128:11.79]Sure!
[128:13.01]Like that.
[128:13.75]Uh, there's only one guy left.
[128:26.71]Don't kill him, don't kill him.
[128:27.49]I need to punch him up in the air two more times.
[128:28.79]I'm gonna do the Mortal Kombat cheese strat and just uppercut him over and over again and then win.
[128:36.15]See?
[128:36.93]Head to feast.
[128:37.43]He's a Kano main.
[128:58.24]All I need is a leg sweep, and I'll be the ultimate make-your-friend-break-the-Super-Nintendo-controller player.
[129:07.63]Just give me the leg sweep and the uppercut, and I will have the turn-your-friend's-face-red strategy.
[129:25.28]My controller's broken.
[129:32.58]Mortal Kombat and the Super Nintendo, yeah.
[129:37.89]Peter.
[129:38.77]So if you're running this place when Mr. Lee's out of town, who's doing your old job?
[129:43.61]Me.
[129:44.47]But I could always use more help.
[129:46.94]You know anyone?
[129:47.92]Actually, I do.
[129:49.60]His name is Miles Morales.
[129:51.76]Why does that sound familiar?
[129:53.50]His father was being honored at City Hall.
[129:56.09]Oh.
[129:58.26]talked to him at the funeral he's a smart kid he's just having a tough time you give your friend the shitty off-brand controller yeah you give him like the mad cat's turbo controller that thing sucked stay busy it might help him too here's his mom's number thanks I'll give her a call hey you haven't heard from Mr. lee have you no why I'm just curious
[130:27.10]I've got a few minutes before work.
[130:28.42]I'm gonna look around, see if there's anything else I can do to help you out.
[130:32.36]Oh, you don't have to.
[130:33.40]Don't let Spider-Man distract you from the fact that I sleep with socks on.
[130:39.55]So there's half the people in this chat.
[130:43.53]I should check out Lee's office.
[130:53.58]Uh...
[130:56.35]That's a pretty rock-solid carrot, Mae.
[131:03.33]Is she cutting that carrot, or is she measuring and marking the carrot where she's going to cut later?
[131:07.83]Can I take a picture of that?
[131:14.03]Or maybe she's making food art.
[131:20.17]Pete, glad to see you're okay.
[131:23.82]Just punch through the door and open it on the other side.
[131:29.59]Alright, there's going to be a little sneak, yeah.
[131:38.35]In public?
[131:41.77]I thought I had a... Isn't there like a rule where don't use your powers in front of muggles, right?
[131:47.95]Or something?
[131:49.73]I can't do this.
[131:52.64]That's the number one rule.
[131:57.74]I can't believe I just did that.
[131:59.83]I'm gonna get minus like 10 points.
[132:04.01]From Gryffindor.
[132:05.39]Minus 10.
[132:05.83]Whoa, electricity!
[132:18.60]high voltage lines what needs this much power no I can't just block on it I think I can overload that junction box oh for that junction box okay mine's two points from gripping but the account number is in Mr. lee's office which is inaccessible I will call you back as soon as I can get that information
[132:47.82]Like, just scream.
[132:49.32]Like... She'd be like, what the fuck is happening up there?
[132:53.70]And you're like, and you just get her away.
[132:55.78]Oh, a stray document.
[133:09.37]Uh-oh.
[133:12.15]Very soon you'll hear stories about me.
[133:13.91]Stories claiming I'm a terrorist and a murderer.
[133:16.57]Those stories will be... Okay.
[133:17.99]What's with my eyes?
[133:19.76]I can't focus on this.
[133:23.78]Okay.
[133:23.96]Please can't... Yeah, yeah.
[133:24.76]Okay.
[133:25.02]Got it.
[133:25.40]Wait.
[133:25.54]Make sure I read it.
[133:26.06]Okay.
[133:26.20]I read it.
[133:43.84]Stray document.
[133:49.52]Hmm.
[133:50.66]And a key.
[133:52.46]Alright.
[133:53.70]Now I just need to find the matchbook, the knife, and the piece of bubblegum.
[134:00.35]And I'll be able to combine this and open the door to escape the room.
[134:04.41]A key.
[134:04.89]I wonder where the lock is.
[134:13.58]He's been arrested.
[134:14.26]I can barely believe it.
[134:16.62]The day I've planned for, dreamed of, is finally here, but for some reason I hesitate.
[134:19.64]Can I really go through with this?
[134:21.94]Lee sounds conflicted.
[134:23.74]Okay.
[134:24.26]The demon is hungry, and I don't think I'm strong enough to hold it back.
[134:28.94]The kingpin wasn't lying.
[134:31.95]That room I saw from the crawlspace, it should be right on the other side of the shrine.
[134:35.83]I just have this?
[134:36.97]Lee did so much for New York.
[134:39.56]Can't believe he was hiding such darkness inside him.
[134:42.80]I just can I want that though?
[134:46.20]Spider-man with a sword would be so much cooler wouldn't he a big bastard sword This is the ghost story Lee's father read to him about a demon that could only be mastered through balance Only balance can master the demons strength without a balance the monster will turn on any who attempt to control it
[135:10.83]I remember watching something where somebody said that.
[135:15.53]Spoiler alert.
[135:16.61]I'm not going to tell you what it was.
[135:20.87]It's a real photo.
[135:21.67]See?
[135:21.89]These are real people.
[135:23.09]There's the key.
[135:26.81]Some kind of puzzle lock.
[135:32.31]Wow.
[135:33.23]Would you look?
[135:33.99]Okay.
[135:35.83]That seems right.
[135:37.96]What about the other one?
[135:42.07]Okay, and then the last one.
[135:48.44]Okay, got it.
[135:55.44]This must be where she's hiding her dragons.
[135:57.21]23, the number 23, the number 23.
[136:02.83]Take pictures of everything.
[136:11.87]Do it.
[136:12.01]Do it.
[136:12.17]Do it.
[136:12.69]Okay.
[136:12.97]Do it.
[136:14.57]Well, there we go.
[136:15.63]I finally get to wield the sword.
[136:41.78]Lee sure is obsessed with masks.
[136:44.46]Is it a Jungian thing?
[136:46.75]Me and you can rule this city, Spider-Man.
[136:51.73]Pretended to be a demon until he became one.
[136:59.82]He's giving his powers to the others.
[137:03.10]How does Lee imbue these with his power?
[137:05.36]Bioelectric induction?
[137:07.67]Compressed phase shift?
[137:10.92]I wonder what would happen if I turned and stabbed myself with this.
[137:19.25]It hurts.
[137:22.79]Put the mask on.
[137:25.13]You can't put the mask on.
[137:26.71]This is all about Norman Osborn.
[137:29.00]His whole career.
[137:30.90]Lee must have been obsessed with him.
[137:32.80]He was keeping tabs on Wilson Fisk too.
[137:35.72]Trying to predict when he'd fall.
[137:37.80]Osborn vows to keep headquarters.
[137:42.20]Osborne no disease about improper clinical trials years ago.
[137:47.44]Did they cover this up?
[137:49.28]I've never heard of it Let's give the secret What's down here cords Plugged shit in I haven't investigated
[138:10.85]I guess.
[138:11.53]Can I look at this?
[138:12.07]Am I blind?
[138:18.59]Am I blind?
[138:19.23]I mean, I pressed every button, didn't I?
[138:20.71]There's a trap door underneath me.
[138:23.43]I got it.
[138:26.93]I got it.
[138:27.17]Creepy.
[138:41.93]Oh, is this one of those things where if you walk by it at the haunted house, it's going to be a normal photo when I turn it this way?
[138:48.86]Oh, that's too bad.
[138:57.63]Okay.
[139:00.09]Well, that was fun.
[139:01.97]I knew it was a trap door.
[139:06.51]It's a burn room.
[139:07.74]Wired to destroy evidence.
[139:12.59]I don't know how to deal with this.
[139:14.91]Just overload the security secret system.
[139:18.41]One, two, three.
[139:20.44]One more.
[139:24.36]Do this upside down.
[139:25.12]It's probably way harder.
[139:28.00]The police have found this.
[139:29.78]Or may.
[139:30.97]I don't want to think of what could have happened.
[139:32.41]Through there?
[139:32.89]Can I fit through there?
[139:33.75]I don't think I can fit through that.
[139:38.01]No, I can't, right?
[139:40.21]A dog can't even fit through that hole.
[139:51.36]Do it.
[139:52.28]Easy, I moved the car.
[140:02.81]A spider could do it.
[140:04.33]That's true, but I'm a spider, but I'm also a man.
[140:09.35]Hello, Peter.
[140:11.23]Oh, excuse me.
[140:13.43]Hi.
[140:13.73]Hi, Lee.
[140:14.51]I thought you were out of town.
[140:16.53]Did you find what you were looking for?
[140:19.17]Martin, you're back.
[140:21.60]Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy.
[140:23.46]I came up again shortly, I'm afraid.
[140:25.14]Just needed a few things from my office.
[140:26.86]You must have heard about City Hall.
[140:29.36]Yes.
[140:31.52]Tragic.
[140:32.48]Peter was there.
[140:33.26]He was very lucky.
[140:35.79]And an Osborne rally.
[140:38.09]I didn't know you were a fan.
[140:41.91]Well, what matters is you are both safe.
[140:45.36]Web him.
[140:46.66]The bombers are still out there.
[140:49.12]Who knows what they've planned next?
[140:50.66]I don't think you or May have anything to worry about.
[140:53.96]As long as you stay away from places you're not supposed to be.
[140:59.14]Quick, grab it.
[141:00.18]You know what I'm talking about.
[141:00.97]Blow your nose in it.
[141:03.45]Make it a deep one, too.
[141:07.23]You know, make sure it's one of those days with this, like, blood up there and, like, green and red and blood and shit, so it's just, it's, he'll never get it out.
[141:23.66]What am I talking about?
[141:24.52]You guys don't have, like, just blood?
[141:26.88]Never mind.
[141:30.14]Why did I think that I was just gonna get banned from Twitch if I talked about bloody boogers?
[141:33.80]Am I serious?
[141:37.29]I'm not gonna lose my Twitch account for that.
[141:50.00]Oh shit, it's the putties!
[141:51.58]From the Power Rangers!
[141:54.60]All we need is for them to go like this.
[141:59.19]What the fuck were those things?
[142:08.04]Why did they do that?
[142:14.18]I guess I got a point to do.
[142:20.92]Perch, take down... Ah, here we go.
[142:22.34]This is the one.
[142:22.84]Big guys can be picked up.
[142:25.98]That's so useful.
[142:27.14]I have to get it.
[142:27.76]Does it cost one?
[142:28.86]Yeah.
[142:29.56]Get it.
[142:33.14]Throwing objects damage all nearby enemies.
[142:35.68]I love throwing shit, so I think I might as well just finish the throw shit category.
[142:44.11]Hold on.
[142:44.59]I'm not going to jump it that quickly here.
[142:46.49]Hold on.
[142:49.55]Web strike, take down, move that to nearby enemies and knock back.
[142:56.24]I need this.
[142:57.92]Especially because there are bonuses that require you to pull weapons out of their hands.
[143:06.66]Throw everything at the wall, see if it sticks.
[143:11.84]I could get that right now.
[143:12.84]What about... Yeah, that seems like fun.
[143:28.76]Now I can pick up the big guys.
[143:36.57]Hold on a second.
[143:37.27]New suit.
[143:39.23]New suit.
[143:39.81]Ooh, what is it?
[143:43.19]Um... It's Stone Cold Steve Spider-Man.
[143:49.47]I don't think I want this.
[143:57.81]Yo, it gets some huge bits here.
[143:59.53]Oh, boy.
[144:01.49]Kill code just came in with $50.
[144:07.65]50 bucks from Kill Code, and there's a clip.
[144:10.73]Thank you so much for the 50 bucks, dude.
[144:12.49]And it says, please make this a new subsound.
[144:15.80]Hold on, let's find out.
[144:16.70]I have to change the audio here, though.
[144:22.12]Let's see.
[144:23.74]All we need is for them to go like this.
[144:26.70]Could have been better.
[144:32.30]It's a little deeper than that.
[144:35.76]Pitch shift that a little bit, and it would be the pot.
[144:37.59]He said it was a little too high.
[144:43.41]There's no way I would make that a sub sound.
[144:45.53]I would get so annoyed by that.
[144:48.05]You want to talk about overtime just irritating me?
[144:52.60]It's all I would be able to hear.
[144:53.52]Alright, so blast enemies with waves of righteous sound.
[144:58.62]Spiderpunk.
[145:07.51]Fine.
[145:12.59]What does it do?
[145:14.57]You actually jump in the air and do a big guitar move.
[145:19.72]This is the kind of outfit in this game that would be a... I don't know what it is with shit like this, man, but in every single multiplayer video game, for some reason, there is a skin that costs a lot of money that is this.
[145:32.98]They always have to add a guitar jam out move as a skin.
[145:41.70]Am I sure this didn't cost like 800 gems or something?
[145:47.78]Whatever.
[145:53.89]Any new upgrades here?
[145:56.01]No.
[145:57.55]I can do some gadget stuff though.
[145:59.73]There we go.
[146:00.21]I can do the whole thing.
[146:03.15]Backpack tokens.
[146:03.99]I only have one landmark token, though.
[146:08.34]This is my favorite gadget so far, but... Landmark.
[146:11.94]Are they all landmark?
[146:16.30]I've got to choose carefully here.
[146:17.95]I'm going to just do the impact.
[146:19.31]I like impact the most.
[146:22.15]At least so far, that is.
[146:22.99]Alright.
[146:28.88]Alright.
[146:30.33]I finally got your evidence.
[146:31.89]Head to the feast center in Chinatown.
[146:34.29]Now this is gonna be the least amount of time we spend at once.
[146:36.37]A nice lady named Mae Parker.
[146:38.19]Some really weird stuff hidden in Lee's office.
[146:40.64]But listen, he's got another attack planned.
[146:43.46]Where?
[146:44.28]When?
[146:45.08]Still working on that, but I think he's going to use something called Devil's Breath.
[146:49.14]Sounds destructive.
[146:50.86]What is it?
[146:51.91]A substance created by Oscorp.
[146:53.95]Probably a bioweapon of some sort.
[146:55.91]I have a folder full of info on it.
[146:58.07]I'm holding on to it for now.
[146:59.06]I'll send copies as soon as I can.
[147:01.38]Okay, we'll check his office.
[147:03.50]If the evidence stands up, I'll put out a... There it is.
[147:08.32]Oh, that's fun.
[147:08.96]MJ, hey, I'm just checking in.
[147:14.32]I think you'll want to hear this.
[147:15.24]Wait, why are you whispering?
[147:16.42]So, people were, somebody was saying, a couple people were saying that they wish that they had the old way to move around.
[147:22.52]I guess that kind of fills the gap a little bit there.
[147:25.64]Cool, see ya.
[147:28.11]Wait, remember how you told me about Nina's corrupting touch?
[147:31.53]I think I just saw it in action.
[147:34.45]How?
[147:35.61]Some perfectly nice homeless people just jumped me.
[147:38.68]Sort of.
[147:39.78]The giant leap was amazing.
[147:40.46]Didn't get it that time.
[147:41.72]I am moving so much faster by doing that, though.
[148:10.36]Backpack.
[148:10.76]Parker?
[148:10.92]Right in the middle.
[148:11.42]Rhino fragment.
[148:11.74]Alright, Peter.
[148:40.41]I know you want to try to impress people, but this is very clearly you cut your dog's toenails and you held on to this and then you zoomed in on it.
[148:48.39]You did some texturing to it in Photoshop.
[148:52.03]I mean, nice try, dude.
[148:55.90]We know you're talented.
[148:56.78]You don't have to pretend anymore, man.
[148:58.90]I wonder if this means I have a job again.
[149:01.44]Yes, I can stop by.
[149:02.54]Just for a minute.
[149:07.88]Anymore landmarks?
[149:08.54]I need landmark tokens.
[149:10.03]Now.
[149:12.07]By now, I mean right now.
[149:16.57]Didn't quite get it.
[149:22.67]At least now I have a good... If I say that right as I don't do it.
[149:27.18]He's corrupted.
[149:27.52]Gotta go easy on him.
[149:28.26]Who's corrupted?
[149:38.25]These guys are kinda just weak.
[149:42.84]Take it easy on him, he says.
[149:44.58]Call this guy an ambulance.
[149:45.64]Uh, photo opportunity.
[150:09.98]Was it park?
[150:11.36]Let me get a good photo for once and not just be spam to get the token photo.
[150:21.09]That wasn't even what I was taking a picture of.
[150:22.71]I took a picture of the fucking... That's not what the photo was supposed to be.
[150:26.97]I took a picture of the playground.
[150:28.90]Here we go.
[150:29.74]Ooh, love that shot.
[150:38.84]Spider-Man, I need help.
[150:39.98]Who?
[150:40.28]You?
[150:41.22]What's up?
[150:49.41]What's the loading screen here for?
[150:58.77]This is a long loading screen.
[151:00.01]Day-night cycle.
[151:09.06]Well, listen, I'm not the best person to help with relationship problems.
[151:13.74]It's not like that.
[151:14.62]I think she's involved with bad people.
[151:16.80]Rodrigo might be in real trouble.
[151:18.78]He's scared, but he won't tell me anything.
[151:21.32]I can check it out.
[151:22.69]Any idea when he's meeting her next?
[151:24.71]Tonight, by the detox center in Greenwich.
[151:27.15]Right.
[151:27.39]Okay.
[151:28.29]Don't worry, Carmen.
[151:29.15]I'll find out what's going on.
[151:30.11]Cheaters.
[151:31.91]Can I get a selfie?
[151:32.77]Could you, like, do something?
[151:35.57]Selfie?
[151:35.89]Who wants a selfie?
[151:37.75]Somebody wanted a selfie?
[151:39.27]Nobody?
[151:39.53]Nobody wants a selfie.
[151:40.63]Shoot a web.
[151:41.47]Okay.
[151:41.63]Hey, I'll do you one up, man.
[151:42.99]Get the camera.
[151:43.69]I'll do you one more.
[151:45.63]Take a look at this.
[151:46.19]Yeah!
[151:46.31]I'm sorry.
[151:46.67]I'm sorry.
[151:47.09]I'm sorry you weren't ready for that.
[152:09.83]Oh, that emote was $11.
[152:10.81]Here we go.
[152:15.22]That was cool.
[152:25.36]Ooh, that was cool!
[152:39.21]I can't help but say woohoo.
[152:40.23]I'm sorry.
[152:41.37]I just can't help it.
[152:42.03]That's Rodrigo.
[152:43.59]He's really nervous.
[152:45.33]That woman doesn't seem like a girlfriend.
[152:47.67]I'll get a photo and see if Carmen recognizes her.
[152:49.57]Get a photo.
[152:50.75]You better not hold anything back.
[152:52.69]Why would I?
[152:53.81]If that picture gets out, my life's over.
[152:55.52]Bad angle.
[153:01.74]Right in his face.
[153:08.61]Bad angle.
[153:11.57]He's with somebody that's not his girlfriend.
[153:15.41]I'll email it to her.
[153:39.41]Ah!
[153:39.55]Ah!
[153:39.75]What the hell?
[153:43.72]Better angle?
[154:09.30]Let's get this fucking lady out of the way How that's not a good picture, how is that not a good picture?
[154:20.43]Better angle needed what better angle do you need?
[154:23.81]I need her face
[154:44.93]Actually dumb.
[154:45.77]No, I'm not.
[154:46.21]No, I'm not.
[154:46.63]No, I'm not.
[154:47.69]He's really nervous.
[154:49.45]That woman doesn't seem like a girlfriend.
[154:50.79]I thought we were just going to get him, like, exchanging drugs.
[154:52.67]How are you going to recognize somebody without a face?
[154:55.57]Do we need to recognize the person, or do we need to know that you're selling drugs?
[155:01.59]Stop saying Spider-Man.
[155:02.87]Stop waving at me.
[155:05.81]Bad angle.
[155:06.62]Need to get it straight on.
[155:11.64]Perfect shot.
[155:12.60]Quiet.
[155:24.49]Who am I saying quiet to?
[155:26.77]The flash?
[155:28.63]What the hell?
[155:28.95]Turn off the flash.
[155:29.35]Yeah, why do I... Alright, what about over here?
[155:30.55]Subject is too far now.
[155:53.42]Perfect shot.
[155:54.06]Okay.
[155:55.16]Oh, God.
[156:07.48]This sounds bigger than I thought I better follow the blackmailer and find out how big Carmen, I'm uploading a photo to you.
[156:15.46]Does this woman look familiar?
[156:16.62]Am I gonna like rip this lady out of the car?
[156:18.41]I've never seen her.
[156:20.05]What were they talking about?
[156:21.63]Sounds like she's blackmailing him.
[156:23.39]She mentioned something about.
[156:24.43]Oh, you had to go this way, didn't you?
[156:25.75]My husband works security at a casino in Atlantic City.
[156:29.12]She could be planning a heist.
[156:30.36]This was so good.
[156:31.10]I need more evidence before I can do anything.
[156:37.13]No!
[156:37.75]No, don't do it.
[156:42.00]Just get over there, Spider-Man.
[156:43.56]Please!
[156:46.86]Did she...?
[156:47.36]Where did she turn?
[156:58.44]I can't, man.
[156:59.40]A lid?
[157:01.00]Hold on a second, I'm sorry.
[157:05.40]I'm sorry, people are going to be really mad about this.
[157:15.63]God damn it, I'm sorry.
[157:18.83]Oh, oh, oh.
[157:19.89]Oh, wait.
[157:23.33]Just play it cool.
[157:24.07]Nobody knows I'm Spider-Man yet.
[157:28.80]Get out of the fucking way.
[157:32.09]Get off.
[157:34.01]Okay, we're fine.
[157:34.57]I still wasn't able to get it.
[157:43.17]I'm sorry.
[157:46.63]I had to do it.
[158:00.73]I'm never taking this power off, by the way.
[158:02.16]I hated this.
[158:02.62]I'm gonna put it on every single suit.
[158:05.70]Look at those sneakers.
[158:07.48]I want those.
[158:29.32]Time to follow this guy.
[158:33.69]No!
[158:33.75]Fucking god damn it!
[158:34.79]Dude, I'm getting so turned around.
[158:57.40]It's not too middle.
[158:58.90]Where's he going?
[158:59.36]Down here?
[158:59.68]What?
[158:59.78]Tap into the train system.
[159:00.56]Tail the subway car.
[159:01.08]Oh my god.
[159:02.24]This is a pretty elaborate mission.
[159:28.67]I don't know why, but for some reason I'm expecting this train to turn like a car.
[159:33.07]Okay, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[159:34.97]I'm gonna lose him.
[159:53.73]That just looks like somebody is hacking in GTA under the fucking ground with a bus.
[160:00.60]I can do that.
[160:06.60]Is he a security guard?
[160:23.53]Hmm can I go in?
[160:25.09]I probably can drop down on them Wait, is it like an opening there?
[160:42.62]Take a look.
[160:43.08]Is there a window or something?
[160:48.70]Where is he?
[160:49.50]Oh, come on.
[160:51.64]I can't get the photo?
[160:52.80]Subject obscurity.
[160:54.50]What?
[160:55.49]Okay.
[161:26.62]I need... Aim at the whiteboard!
[161:34.49]Around the building.
[161:41.05]Yeah!
[161:43.56]What?
[161:45.44]That wasn't it.
[161:45.74]What are you talking about?
[161:47.56]I'm confused.
[161:51.68]What?
[161:56.03]Oh, that too.
[161:56.75]Okay.
[162:01.21]Streamer is actually an idiot.
[162:02.85]No.
[162:02.93]Oh.
[162:26.20]Do I have to watch this guy?
[162:27.43]Is this part of the mission?
[162:38.13]I don't think I can do anything.
[162:56.12]I took too long.
[162:56.74]They got away.
[162:57.56]Oh, did they?
[162:58.00]He just got in the car.
[162:59.92]I can't do the guitar.
[163:00.90]Oh, whatever.
[163:12.37]Is he going to put me right there?
[163:17.05]Yeah.
[163:17.48]Well, this time it's a different... He didn't have a driver.
[163:25.12]That was the problem.
[163:27.06]They forgot to load the guy's driver.
[163:39.19]Hello.
[163:40.77]What about this one?
[163:42.93]Cool.
[163:44.91]Anybody?
[163:49.66]Anybody?
[163:52.42]I'm gonna go to the other car.
[163:53.32]No I don't.
[163:57.65]Last guy.
[163:58.09]Guy driving.
[164:01.03]What about the other car?
[164:05.29]Up.
[164:09.86]Okay.
[164:10.26]That means he stops too.
[164:27.21]Alright, let's go!
[164:27.93]Hey, you dick.
[164:30.51]Alright.
[164:35.86]I love it when a plan falls apart.
[164:39.16]Hey, Carmen.
[164:40.34]Your husband's pal and his team just had their trip to beautiful Atlantic City cancelled.
[164:44.94]Thank you.
[164:45.96]By the way, I'm doing that after I fight.
[164:48.08]Which is not what I'm supposed to do.
[164:50.80]Rodrigo didn't know about it.
[164:53.14]He was just picking with his friends.
[164:55.07]I've got a contact on the force.
[164:57.01]She'll help Rodrigo.
[164:57.61]That's a long side to Sean.
[164:58.39]Especially if he'll agree to testify about the blackmail.
[165:01.01]He will.
[165:02.21]Or I'll show him he needs to be a lot more afraid of me than to Sean.
[165:06.33]Okay.
[165:06.65]Thanks, Spider-Man.
[165:09.69]Spider-Man P.I.
[165:10.55]Are we changing back today?
[165:16.32]We are.
[165:18.48]Well, I don't know why I just can't stay night.
[165:33.19]Check it out, it's Spider-Man.
[165:35.95]I wanna be able to high-five more people.
[165:38.51]Here we go, this guy.
[165:39.21]Did he just tell me to fix this?
[165:40.17]Oh, okay.
[166:01.46]Is that pretty much a guy telling me, hey, you need more towers.
[166:03.90]Please activate the one above you.
[166:05.87]Oh, it's a crime here.
[166:06.53]I'll take care of this.
[166:34.05]Ow.
[166:35.09]Web throw, five objects.
[166:36.43]One was the other one, and I missed it.
[166:46.54]No.
[166:48.34]Bench.
[166:49.64]Crash.
[166:53.44]That counts from two finishers.
[166:56.08]That's going to be hard to do.
[167:07.80]Need to build up.
[167:09.52]Let's do this.
[167:11.08]Focus.
[167:11.26]There we go.
[167:13.39]Finisher.
[167:17.19]Can he yank their guns?
[167:18.35]Yeah, I can.
[167:18.83]Actually, thank you for saying that.
[167:20.35]Because yes, I can.
[167:25.87]I need that.
[167:28.17]Need another finisher.
[167:41.55]I need focus!
[167:42.11]I need focus!
[167:42.47]Come on!
[167:44.53]Come on!
[167:46.51]Nah!
[167:48.72]Got a backpack over here.
[167:52.84]Cool.
[167:53.16]Did I already get this?
[167:54.14]Did I get this black cat thing here?
[167:55.32]I did not.
[167:55.82]Let's do it.
[168:12.47]Another camera.
[168:13.89]Looks like Black Cat, alright.
[168:15.09]Guitar it.
[168:17.51]Oh, poor spider.
[168:19.52]I know I disappointed you when I couldn't go straight, but why mess with perfection?
[168:23.96]If I was a game developer hiding things, it would be up there.
[168:26.40]Is it actually?
[168:35.08]No, it's not pointing me in the right direction.
[168:44.59]Where are you?
[168:48.23]That's not why you're a game dev.
[168:50.03]Well, yeah.
[168:50.81]Well, yeah, you know what I'm saying?
[169:01.50]I ain't picking up anything.
[169:12.78]Blind?
[169:13.94]It's here?
[169:14.30]Where do you see it?
[169:43.01]Where I'm pointing.
[169:44.83]You guys told me it was left.
[169:46.22]A bunch of you guys are telling me to go left.
[169:49.06]That was down and to the right.
[169:49.94]Okay.
[169:50.12]Down here.
[170:09.27]Backpack.
[170:11.21]Where are you?
[170:13.35]Hear the beeps.
[170:16.99]There it is.
[170:17.77]What the hell?
[170:18.17]Oh, it's in the corner.
[170:19.20]Old cell phone!
[170:19.76]I'm sorry, I cut him off.
[170:38.26]I know people are gonna be really mad about me cutting that off.
[170:40.60]Uh, what?
[170:59.52]I didn't know there was actually a train.
[171:02.32]Imagine you're the train conductor.
[171:04.22]You killed Spider-Man.
[171:05.66]You drove right into him.
[171:09.47]Okay, well, now we know that that happens.
[171:12.41]Let's go above it.
[171:13.09]Can I get on top?
[171:17.79]That would be cool if I could get on top.
[171:21.41]Eh, if I was better.
[171:29.48]No!
[171:57.42]Whatever.
[171:57.90]Too slow.
[171:59.24]Alright, I gotta take a deal with this.
[172:00.92]I gotta go up there.
[172:01.81]...honoring fallen heroes like Jefferson.
[172:03.61]It's also a day to bow...
[172:20.99]What the fuck?
[172:22.47]Oh, no, this is not the threat.
[172:23.49]This is like the... Okay, well, I might as well do it.
[172:25.71]I wish I could see what the heck I was doing.
[172:27.09]Let's go with... Let's put some drones out here.
[172:53.49]This is mine.
[172:54.43]Stick one of these over there.
[172:55.39]Stick one of these over here.
[172:58.38]I can't trip these, right?
[173:00.96]Probably not.
[173:04.84]This guy's gonna come at me.
[173:05.62]Come at me, come at me.
[173:06.18]Come on, run, run, run forward.
[173:21.06]Davy again.
[173:22.28]Always getting Davy.
[173:25.60]That wasn't very funny.
[173:33.90]Oh, imagine you could do a double team move.
[173:36.14]That would be so cool.
[173:57.64]Wow, fuck you.
[173:58.40]I had a combo going there.
[173:59.38]Thought I could get it in time.
[174:16.07]Watch it.
[174:16.51]Watch it.
[174:18.85]Get a drone out.
[174:23.25]Your favorite toy won't help you.
[174:28.52]Guys, get a blocker.
[174:29.58]Blocker.
[174:29.96]Hmm.
[174:30.14]Hmm.
[175:01.13]No, you won't!
[175:04.95]Use your emote, Spider-Man.
[175:13.44]On the la- I wanna do it- I wanna do it on the last wave.
[175:16.54]No, I'll show them how to show over here.
[175:29.63]That move is not even good because it just moves everybody far away from you.
[175:39.47]The regular.
[175:43.27]Round and round we go.
[175:44.97]Yeah, that's true.
[175:48.18]Right on rooftops.
[175:52.24]You're right.
[176:01.36]Get away!
[176:02.10]Didn't dodge that?
[176:11.19]Didn't dodge that, that's for sure.
[176:15.59]Damn, okay, I gotta move.
[176:20.89]Let's get out.
[176:28.23]Electricity, they're all grouped up here.
[176:41.48]Yikes!
[176:42.18]I can't punch him if he's in the air!
[176:45.26]Goodbye.
[176:47.06]I'm gonna get him.
[176:48.04]He's healed.
[177:28.68]There we go.
[177:30.92]Didn't rock out.
[177:31.56]Yes, I did.
[177:34.18]Right at the end.
[177:34.70]Got it.
[177:37.49]Let's break it down.
[177:38.33]Those four enemies took you 10 minutes.
[177:40.47]That was like 30 enemies.
[177:41.69]It was like four waves is what you meant to say.
[178:00.25]Didn't throw.
[178:00.71]I didn't throw any objects.
[178:02.10]Oh well.
[178:07.88]Six waves.
[178:08.54]Six waves!
[178:09.50]Six waves!
[178:10.96]Dang.
[178:12.97]If I was anticlimactic, I could have done a much better job there.
[178:17.35]Come on, Spider-Man.
[178:18.95]You're better.
[178:21.07]I want this tower.
[178:29.17]That's so much fun it just is it just is
[178:57.52]It seems way too hot for jeans and a vest.
[179:01.50]Oh, it's cold in New York.
[179:12.47]So I'm actually playing the game?
[179:14.43]I guess, yeah.
[179:17.03]I'm playing the game.
[179:19.37]Photo!
[179:20.11]Where is it?
[179:20.67]Right here?
[179:25.79]Oh, he got it!
[179:31.88]bag.
[179:35.28]Who cares about anything else?
[179:36.28]I just care about the bag.
[179:38.02]Where are you at?
[179:49.11]When you were publishing the Bugle, you were always fair to me.
[179:51.51]Top, sure, but fair.
[179:53.41]That's from there.
[179:53.98]Well, that's my job, Mr. Mayor.
[179:55.92]All I have is my integrity, and I won't compromise it for anyone.
[179:59.60]MJ article.
[180:00.28]MJ wrote this article in the school paper about student protests.
[180:04.06]She was a heck of a journalist even then.
[180:05.94]Where's Tony Stark?
[180:08.86]I don't think he's in this game.
[180:21.74]How do I unsubscribe from his channel?
[180:29.20]I don't think I can.
[180:30.88]I thought I could.
[180:34.42]Don't!
[180:35.14]What do you mean, don't?
[180:36.79]You want to keep JJJ on?
[180:40.89]Alright, I'll keep it on.
[180:52.27]Stealth?
[180:52.55]I didn't do any stealth takedowns.
[180:59.83]Well, that guy is freaking out with a weapon.
[181:04.37]Alright, well.
[181:06.14]Good.
[181:10.74]Very cool.
[181:11.50]Except not really.
[181:25.24]Is he blocking that shit?
[181:26.16]He is.
[181:26.50]Dickhead, really?
[181:41.92]Goodbye.
[181:42.56]Get out of my way.
[181:51.47]Swing him into his friend.
[181:52.62]Oh, I had to do that.
[181:55.84]Holy fuck, that hurt.
[182:03.55]Yikes.
[182:03.71]Oh, shit.
[182:18.70]Don't go too far.
[182:20.85]Let's grab this guy in.
[182:22.75]Great.
[182:23.05]He wants victory only.
[182:26.13]That's right.
[182:26.57]I wanted to activate this tower, didn't I?
[182:48.20]This is actually very far away.
[182:51.56]There it is.
[182:52.02]I am going so fast.
[182:53.06]Too fast.
[182:53.44]Okay.
[183:20.25]How come there's no miles per hour in the corner?
[183:23.05]I should be able to turn that on.
[183:26.86]I'm so far away from that.
[183:27.92]Alright, time to get really high up and then just dash.
[183:39.53]Hmm?
[183:43.61]No, don't do a funny trick.
[183:45.55]I want you to run.
[183:55.46]That was stupid.
[184:01.10]Let's get max speed here.
[184:10.61]Dive bomb again.
[184:45.29]That's so fun to do.
[184:47.01]Just jumping around.
[184:47.91]No more Jupiters.
[184:54.43]What are you talking about?
[184:55.57]What do you mean, no more Jupiter?
[185:02.47]How could you even say such a thing?
[185:15.14]What?
[185:15.30]There's something going on here.
[185:17.70]What?
[185:18.20]Oh.
[185:20.25]I guess there is something going- on the bridge?
[185:24.38]Oh, there is a... Let's try to do some takedowns.
[185:32.27]Probably get a bunch of stealth kills here.
[185:33.87]Or I can at least try... No, they're looking this way.
[185:40.51]Maybe I'll just walk up.
[185:42.91]No, I don't have enough of that.
[185:45.91]Oh, I could put the drones out.
[185:55.44]They're looking this way.
[185:58.88]I could probably go up here.
[186:00.02]Can I reach it from there?
[186:02.14]Oh, hold on.
[186:03.26]There we go.
[186:08.30]Okay.
[186:09.10]Let's drop down.
[186:13.32]Breaking news just in.
[186:15.22]My sources tell me the police are now looking at the demons as the primary suspects in the City Hall bombing.
[186:21.82]What?
[186:22.03]Oh, that was... Come on!
[186:23.83]I thought that was gonna be like a stealth takedown on the ledge.
[186:27.62]Apparently not.
[186:49.57]Leap prime in three minutes.
[186:51.43]Whoops.
[186:58.67]Sorry.
[187:01.28]Where the fuck is he?
[187:05.22]Oh, he's right there.
[187:05.86]Disarm the primary device.
[187:13.72]This thing.
[187:22.43]Oh, shit.
[187:25.79]Okay.
[187:27.75]What were these things?
[187:28.39]I need three voltage.
[187:29.25]That's five.
[187:37.20]And I got some negatives here.
[187:44.22]So then this comes... Maybe I have to come down?
[187:52.72]Hold on a second.
[187:55.02]Oh, fuck.
[187:55.84]Okay.
[187:56.54]Right.
[187:59.00]It's gonna be my plus five.
[188:00.62]It's gonna go this way first.
[188:02.28]Hold on.
[188:02.54]No, it doesn't.
[188:02.96]Holy Jesus Christ.
[188:05.66]Hold on.
[188:09.80]Wrong one.
[188:10.30]It's this one.
[188:12.34]Oh my god.
[188:17.61]Wrong one.
[188:18.25]Hey, three minutes, huh?
[188:24.07]Just get rid of these.
[188:24.79]I can get rid of all these.
[188:25.89]This is minus 2.
[188:37.92]So I need minus 2.
[188:38.58]No, I need minus 2.
[188:39.28]And then plus 5.
[188:53.04]Fuck me.
[188:58.70]Can't turn it that way.
[189:06.79]This is wrong.
[189:07.45]This is just wrong.
[189:10.89]Can't move this one.
[189:11.71]Can I move this?
[189:12.59]No.
[189:15.15]I get to split it here.
[189:26.81]-2.
[189:29.95]That's three.
[189:31.07]Okay.
[189:31.95]Bring it home.
[189:33.71]That's not correct.
[189:36.42]That's it.
[189:38.18]I win.
[189:38.38]Three minutes!
[189:41.26]Oh, come on.
[189:41.76]Oh, it's a disarmed key.
[190:00.26]Two bombs disabled.
[190:00.90]Take out the snipers.
[190:02.04]You hear these guys?
[190:08.74]Where's this asshole?
[190:12.46]Up here?
[190:15.10]Over this way.
[190:15.66]Let's just get these guys first.
[190:27.76]What the fuck?
[190:29.88]Okay.
[190:38.21]He's dead.
[190:39.85]Last guy, over here.
[190:49.39]Yep.
[190:51.19]Broke his head.
[190:51.83]Smash just going.
[190:53.91]Okay.
[190:55.34]Didn't do it in three minutes.
[190:56.30]Terrible streamer.
[190:57.06]Oops, almost forgot.
[190:58.38]I have to do that off the highest building in the game.
[191:00.74]Pigeon.
[191:01.14]Come here, you little shit.
[191:22.59]I don't even know why I want these, but I want them.
[191:24.75]The game has told me I want these.
[191:26.09]Okay.
[191:38.88]Oh, it's a research token.
[191:39.76]Okay, cool.
[191:42.73]Read the lore of the pigeons.
[191:46.37]Backpack is straight ahead.
[191:47.65]Hey, look.
[191:48.55]It's so easy to get.
[191:49.61]It's right in the corner.
[191:57.63]Okay, that was almost embarrassing.
[192:00.19]I thought web swinging would let me get pizzas delivered fast.
[192:03.71]And it did.
[192:04.73]Fast and smashed.
[192:07.05]What do I mean?
[192:08.23]Go to the doctor?
[192:08.96]Why do I have to go to the doctor?
[192:14.36]Got a skill point.
[192:15.12]I don't think I'm going to use it, though.
[192:17.26]Kind of want... Precise damage and range of web strike.
[192:21.18]Yes.
[192:22.48]I use that a lot.
[192:25.75]You guys are making me hungry.
[192:26.65]Stop making me hungry.
[192:32.07]You guys are making me really hungry.
[192:36.63]We got new suits too?
[192:38.31]Okay, I'll look at them.
[192:42.34]Nope.
[192:46.80]Nope.
[192:48.24]Just the same one.
[192:48.86]A tasty hot plate of pizza.
[192:54.65]You know what I could go for right now?
[192:57.52]I don't know about a beef stew.
[192:59.32]I don't know why.
[192:59.88]There's big chunks of beef stew.
[193:01.50]Sure, why not?
[193:02.08]Beef stew on stream.
[193:02.82]I don't think I can do that.
[193:24.88]Caught him off again.
[193:25.62]You know, it's actually been kind of a long time since we've had a boss fight.
[193:34.58]Shocker was the last boss.
[193:38.86]I wonder if this is where we get a... I wonder if this is where the heal turn happens for Echo.
[193:51.59]Lots of new stuff.
[193:52.87]We really need to get better about organizing our workspace.
[193:55.71]Where did you get all this equipment?
[193:57.53]Called in every last day.
[193:59.05]Transform.
[193:59.83]Took out a few loans.
[194:01.29]It's like we're starting over once again.
[194:03.31]But this time's going to be different.
[194:08.72]What you got here?
[194:09.92]I can't take the camera out, unfortunately.
[194:11.92]You've been busy.
[194:13.26]Just getting started.
[194:15.37]PS4 is chugging right now.
[194:17.17]For some reason.
[194:17.67]You hear that?
[194:18.05]This thing's gonna explode.
[194:20.31]It must be loading a ton of shit in the background or something.
[194:23.77]Is there a big scene coming up here?
[194:58.12]Bad timing.
[195:26.74]It was a good joke, Parker.
[195:29.53]Just a bit of an overreaction on my part.
[195:32.07]No, don't worry.
[195:34.29]Is there a reason why he looks like Lester from GTA 5?
[195:36.67]I'll clean this up and get us ready for another test.
[195:48.83]So, I hope you don't mind me asking, but... Bad what?
[195:51.53]The stream went down?
[195:52.01]It seems you and Norman have a bit of a history.
[195:54.81]We were lab partners in college.
[195:56.73]Am I not alive anymore?
[195:58.41]Became friends.
[196:01.82]Decided to start a business.
[196:03.08]That's weird.
[196:04.18]We both had visions of changing the world just in different ways.
[196:08.72]Wait.
[196:09.52]Strange.
[196:10.14]You were at Oscorp when it started?
[196:12.17]I'm half the reason it's called Oscorp.
[196:15.29]In grad school, everyone called us the O's.
[196:19.89]Add corp to that and, well...
[196:22.59]It is a catchy name.
[196:24.13]O-Corp.
[196:24.67]Well, why'd you leave?
[196:27.31]Norman became more and more obsessed with genetics.
[196:31.23]He started a project I considered unethical.
[196:35.03]And there was this... Anyway, lawyers got involved.
[196:40.84]I chose to leave in exchange for a settlement.
[196:43.50]But that money didn't last very long.
[196:46.08]I've relied on grants ever since.
[196:48.49]like I can taste the sweat this project doesn't work don't worry it'll work let me let me just fix this up I'll brew some fresh coffee what is insomniac most known for ration clank be sure to run a diagnostic on the control unit could be a short what else have they done oh
[197:17.77]Spyro, Ratchet and Clank.
[197:18.71]So they went from Spyro, Ratchet and Clank to this.
[197:26.06]That's a pretty good range for a developer.
[197:33.03]They made Resistance too?
[197:34.45]They obviously made Infamous as well, okay.
[197:35.97]Yeah, that makes sense now.
[197:36.95]Alright.
[197:37.79]He needs a voltage of 6.
[197:41.18]So it has to pass through.
[197:44.62]These are locked.
[197:46.22]So it has to go through here.
[197:47.24]Are these all locked?
[197:52.02]These are locked.
[197:53.30]These are not locked.
[197:55.36]Get rid of these.
[197:58.69]I can get, okay, here we go.
[198:00.09]So, think, Jeremy.
[198:03.21]I need it to pass through.
[198:04.91]So it has to go through these two.
[198:07.65]I guess that has to stay.
[198:09.25]So then it has to go down here.
[198:14.54]No, this one.
[198:19.94]I wonder if I can just do it like this.
[198:23.80]Hmm.
[198:27.85]What do I have for options here?
[198:28.89]Minus four and minus three.
[198:32.95]Well, shit.
[198:33.67]Okay.
[198:35.83]So this has to come all the way down and then around.
[198:37.73]Oh, fuck.
[198:44.41]Plus 5.
[198:44.71]Maybe I shouldn't even go through these at all.
[198:46.39]Because if it goes down here, I need 5.
[198:55.88]So let's say it was 9.
[198:58.46]And minus 3.
[199:00.96]So it has to come up here.
[199:06.45]I wonder if this is going to work.
[199:22.01]Yeah.
[199:24.30]Oh, wait.
[199:25.70]Oh, it's not six.
[199:27.66]It's not six.
[199:29.46]It's five.
[199:30.38]I don't know why I was going for six.
[199:31.84]Alright.
[199:33.48]Well, then let's just do four instead of three.
[199:35.08]Okay.
[199:44.10]Streamer can't add.
[199:44.82]No, I was going for six because I'm stupid.
[199:48.79]From the beginning, I was going for six, not for five.
[200:05.73]We burnt the coffee?
[200:07.49]I think we did it.
[200:08.89]Burnt coffee can be better sometimes.
[200:11.31]That's a lot of work for you to do by yourself.
[200:16.48]Sure you can handle it?
[200:17.42]Apparently not, judging by today's debacle.
[200:19.82]Because I still haven't found another job.
[200:21.22]My funds are still... I know.
[200:23.38]It's okay.
[200:23.96]Don't worry, I'll figure it out.
[200:25.40]Asking for a job?
[200:26.20]What's a few bucks when you're trying to change the world, right?
[200:30.45]To changing the world.
[200:35.91]Try to make him drink it.
[200:37.83]With that arm.
[200:42.11]Nice call from MJ.
[200:45.03]Doctor, I need to go, but I'll be back later.
[200:47.51]Don't worry, the work will still be here when you get back.
[200:50.47]Okay, bye.
[200:54.43]Neural interface would be a big step, Doc.
[200:56.97]Big, yes, but essential.
[200:59.55]If our prosthesis is anything less than effortless to use, we'll have failed.
[201:04.43]We'll get there, Peter.
[201:06.36]We have to.
[201:06.88]Alright, I'll give you another big thumbs up to this game.
[201:12.48]Even the in-game cutscenes are fully lip-synced.
[201:18.42]That's... That's a lot of time.
[201:25.40]Parker, we've been focused on limb replacement.
[201:29.54]Connecting nerves at severed extremities, replicating
[201:34.70]I just walked away.
[201:35.16]I'm sorry guys.
[201:35.88]I didn't even say bye.
[201:36.62]I didn't even say over.
[202:03.09]Skipping lore?
[202:03.79]Well, we already know how it happens.
[202:07.54]You get enough of the takes to know what the rest of the conversation will be.
[202:10.70]I don't.
[202:17.96]You don't know what happens with Dr. Octopus?
[202:20.33]I mean, Otto?
[202:21.87]Octavius?
[202:26.81]Well, don't look and don't type it into Google.
[202:31.00]don't type Dr octavius into Google that's all I'm gonna say ah I'll get this you need to get the middle of this tree anyways doing I'm doing it don't don't do it man hey sorry I missed your call were you still on for dinner
[202:57.93]About something else seven days ago.
[203:00.07]Yeah, we should talk over dinner the offer still stands for me to come over and cook Oh, really?
[203:04.93]Well, I like to take risks That's all you guys don't okay talk soon Didn't get any level ups or anything look my move list I
[203:30.11]long dodge off the wall web shooter yeah yeah alright dinner at mj's let's go low expectations it'll be hard to screw this one up guess I'll just freelance for a while until she calls explore the city to upgrade your gear and abilities I will go take some photos why not why not
[204:11.97]That's what I have.
[204:12.71]Backpack.
[204:18.33]Backpack.
[204:19.37]Up top.
[204:28.82]Give me.
[204:33.86]It's only been one day.
[204:34.56]My underarm whips.
[204:40.06]Thought they might help me glide short distances, but they never really worked.
[204:43.82]Looked cool, though.
[204:46.62]Can we actually try to do that at some point as Spider-Man?
[204:51.74]Okay, we got a photo over there.
[204:55.94]Can I get it from over this way?
[204:57.45]That's a keeper.
[204:58.77]I needed some landmark tokens anyways.
[205:03.07]There is research tokens, a backpack.
[205:06.41]We'll go in a line over here until somebody calls me.
[205:19.60]Uh, what was it?
[205:21.10]No, it's further up.
[205:24.66]It's further up.
[205:32.10]Still further up.
[205:40.40]The dab.
[205:43.90]I've tried to call you, but your bathroom door is stuck.
[205:47.88]Are you in there?
[205:54.88]off JJJ deliberately.
[205:56.32]I mean, I don't really want to hear him talk.
[206:00.80]He's a nuisance.
[206:03.04]Station monitors water pressure for nearby buildings.
[206:04.95]Anything goes wrong, pipe bursts or clogs, an alert is automatically sent out to the city's maintenance teams.
[206:10.77]At least that's what would happen if Oscorp had ever pushed the city to approve the system.
[206:15.99]Let's go.
[206:19.74]So this station monitors the water pressure down to the individual building.
[206:23.61]Structures above four stories use water towers to augment the city's system.
[206:27.35]The idea is to identify problems before they spread.
[206:31.21]You know?
[206:31.83]Whoa.
[206:34.40]The pressure in this building's all over the map.
[206:36.92]I need to find out why.
[206:38.42]The water towers connect to the city's system at the four story mark.
[206:42.30]I'll scan the pipes, try to see where this starts.
[206:47.69]Pipes are fine up here.
[206:49.07]Whatever's causing this, it's lower.
[206:51.41]Jesus.
[206:57.96]I can't go in it.
[206:58.54]I can't just, like, Super Mario, like, dunk, dunk, dunk!
[207:04.03]Whatever, fine.
[207:13.69]Is that a bullet?
[207:19.55]Right here is the problem Is there somebody did somebody flush like some q-tips down the toilet?
[207:25.27]Let me fix it Here's the problem valve's at the wrong setting easy enough to fix That shouldn't have happened I better seal these fast before jameson pins it on me Patch up the bug tower You rapidly fire r1 to seal the tanks
[207:56.50]Have a time limit guys I have a time limit Better than duct tape Just call me the amazing spider plumber I
[208:20.43]Oh.
[208:24.75]Not on this side.
[208:25.75]Shit.
[208:32.12]Hmm?
[208:36.36]I'll fix it.
[208:43.31]Jeremy.
[208:44.43]Eee.
[208:52.55]I'm getting okay.
[208:53.39]I thought I still had like 30 seconds left.
[208:55.95]No, I got plenty of time Where is it up there?
[209:14.84]Oh
[209:17.56]One side.
[209:22.56]Got it.
[209:23.22]Last one.
[209:24.38]Those won't hold long.
[209:25.32]Under pressure clear, block drainage.
[209:28.43]The drainage is blocked.
[209:29.87]I'll check the outlet pipe.
[209:31.39]The outlet pipe's down by the waterfront.
[209:33.49]I'll go see if anything's blocking it.
[209:41.69]Again, it makes it look like you're going to die when you fall in the water.
[209:46.35]It slows down and does a... Ooh, you... No, you're fine.
[209:50.57]Oops.
[209:52.63]That was the pipe.
[209:55.96]What is this drain?
[209:58.96]Yep, that'll do it.
[210:00.98]I better clear it before something bursts.
[210:02.70]There really is just shit paper in here.
[210:11.14]Now I ask.
[210:13.23]I knew where it was, I just couldn't get over to it.
[210:18.37]I was trying to do it the cheap, easy way.
[210:21.88]But that ended up being the hard way.
[210:24.74]Two research points, cool.
[210:41.93]so I got a thousand feet meters whatever suit power is ready yeah I had to do it we all know it
[211:14.38]They just shot me in the air with a gun.
[211:16.18]I don't know who they were.
[211:18.54]I don't know where they were.
[211:19.62]And I don't know why they did that.
[211:36.63]Oops.
[211:40.62]That was cool.
[211:41.18]That's the coolest thing I've done the whole game.
[211:49.14]Alright, back to Aunt May's house.
[211:50.29]Or whoever's house this is.
[211:52.49]This is actually, I don't know.
[211:54.29]This is my house.
[211:56.39]So this is somebody's house.
[211:57.49]Somebody lives here.
[212:02.37]I missed a bird?
[212:03.03]Fuck.
[212:03.53]Sorry.
[212:04.09]What is this?
[212:20.15]Does the game have a charge jump or just a tap jump?
[212:23.77]You unlock two different jumps.
[212:25.97]There's a roll jump that I had not unlocked yet.
[212:29.34]And then there's the, when you land on a surface, you tap.
[212:33.54]If you time it right, you get a big forward momentum boost.
[212:37.57]This is the address Pete found.
[212:39.63]Men are all carrying firearms.
[212:42.31]What is this place?
[212:50.19]Well.
[212:50.35]This is the filler mission.
[212:51.69]Does that skip the whole cutscene?
[212:53.11]It does, does it?
[212:53.69]Oh well.
[212:53.99]Alright, I don't want to do this like three times.
[213:18.52]Huh?
[213:19.20]What was that?
[213:20.40]What dumbass can't put their shit away?
[213:23.02]Bet it was happy.
[213:24.40]So Marge likes to be pushed to the left or right to direct enemies.
[213:29.40]Almost shot a rat.
[213:31.94]Okay, yeah, he's going to go that way.
[213:33.82]Marge wants to talk to you.
[213:34.50]Get in here!
[213:44.37]What am I doing?
[213:49.25]What am I doing?
[213:51.34]What am I doing?
[213:52.64]Avoid walking into boxes and broken glass.
[213:54.32]The sound they make will alert enemies.
[214:00.84]I can't see where these people are.
[214:02.16]Don't step on the glass.
[214:04.42]I just walked right into the boxes.
[214:06.58]Am I hearing things?
[214:19.83]You're clearly doing that, man.
[214:21.13]Don't come over here.
[214:21.87]Guys, you realize this is impossible for me to go that way.
[214:32.28]What?
[214:33.06]Oh, shit!
[214:38.84]Right!
[214:39.94]He was right on top of me.
[214:41.30]That was so scary.
[214:42.48]Holy shit, there's too many boxes.
[214:43.63]Somebody can see me.
[215:13.63]My guy's not going to walk back through the boxes, is he?
[215:16.62]That guy can see me.
[215:21.04]Turn around.
[215:38.73]Where is he?
[215:39.24]I swear I left it open.
[215:47.09]Did I do that?
[215:48.81]Oh fuck.
[215:52.07]Oh fuck.
[215:54.37]I can go.
[215:55.13]I can go.
[215:55.47]Where do I go though?
[215:56.07]Which way?
[215:57.23]Oh.
[215:57.55]No.
[215:57.77]Box.
[215:58.13]Box.
[215:59.99]Stray box.
[216:00.55]Okay.
[216:00.93]Where's the office?
[216:02.94]God damn it.
[216:03.36]There's a box right here.
[216:05.14]There's a box.
[216:07.06]I can't go that way.
[216:07.72]There's a box trap that way.
[216:10.40]Stray behind him.
[216:13.22]Just touch this.
[216:13.76]I don't know what it does.
[216:14.28]Touch it.
[216:16.31]Touch that!
[216:19.29]Oh fu- No!
[216:20.43]God damn it!
[216:22.99]I docked over too many boxes!
[216:28.72]Now I can actually go this way.
[216:37.78]Yeah, there was a box right there.
[216:38.74]I couldn't even cross it.
[216:40.14]Oh, Jesus.
[216:40.74]So then I have to pull everybody this way.
[216:51.93]That guy's not going anywhere.
[216:55.66]Maybe I can distract him.
[216:57.10]Who's seeing me right now?
[216:58.32]Who is seeing me?
[216:59.26]That guy crossed the plane?
[217:00.60]Hey, anyone pick up more beer after our last run?
[217:08.20]I heard something.
[217:12.46]They all hear it.
[217:13.26]I saw something.
[217:16.36]I'm gonna check it out.
[217:21.21]Eat my shit.
[217:22.32]Oh my god, eat shit.
[217:24.10]Oh my god, eat shit.
[217:25.74]Oh my god, eat shit.
[217:27.22]All of you.
[217:28.32]Oh my god.
[217:29.74]Every block.
[217:31.28]Just wait a minute.
[217:31.86]I can get there.
[217:33.08]God damn it.
[217:41.95]Yes.
[217:42.69]I got a checkpoint.
[217:43.37]Okay.
[217:52.50]What's in these?
[217:56.48]Fuck!
[217:57.16]Come on!
[217:58.77]We'll never notice!
[218:03.37]Do I get the gun?
[218:06.11]Who's that?
[218:07.89]Tombstone.
[218:08.77]Tombstone?
[218:11.09]You're right, Rick.
[218:13.61]Won't notice?
[218:16.64]Cuz it won't be there!
[218:21.87]Gotta give this guy some credit, though.
[218:27.72]You got some stones, Rick.
[218:30.56]How come nobody ever pulls the trigger?
[218:31.98]You know what I mean?
[218:33.20]Let's see if they break.
[218:35.40]Somebody always goes like, yeah, why don't you do it?
[218:39.03]Do it.
[218:40.25]Oh, thank, good.
[218:41.75]Nice work, man.
[218:45.41]He just falls backwards really slowly.
[218:47.63]Such a disappointment.
[218:57.05]That's pretty gruesome.
[218:58.67]I didn't have to add that bone crack and it was there.
[219:00.73]The tombstone.
[219:21.01]Okay, we got... guy on the left, toolkit, guy on the right.
[219:25.11]Toolkit, gonna push the toolkit to the right.
[219:32.98]Then into the office we go.
[219:41.17]So what's in this office that I need?
[219:43.94]The blueprints.
[219:45.88]Blueprints.
[219:46.93]An APC.
[219:47.97]Got it.
[219:48.93]This is what they're building for Lee.
[219:50.35]What's this?
[219:52.17]Here we go.
[219:53.87]GPS trackers.
[219:56.15]What is Tombstone using these for?
[219:57.51]Just key his bike.
[219:58.19]Alright, boys.
[219:59.72]Time to move.
[220:01.24]Get the gear for my office.
[220:11.06]Okay, I want to say don't ever do that again, but since I know you're going to anyway, here.
[220:18.07]Take a few of those next time.
[220:19.59]Nice.
[220:20.79]Thanks.
[220:20.93]Oh, I figured out how to make these.
[220:21.75]You know Tombstone is crazy and pretty much invincible, right?
[220:24.61]Everybody has their weakness.
[220:27.03]Mine is whatever you're cooking right now.
[220:30.55]It smells amazing.
[220:31.75]Oh, it's beef stew.
[220:32.66]The chicken curry.
[220:33.50]I just need some time to simmer.
[220:35.28]No dumplings, I hope.
[220:37.27]Stop saying food names.
[220:38.59]We're never going to let me live that one down, are you?
[220:40.46]Nope.
[220:41.26]The great dumpling catastrophe.
[220:42.92]I still can't believe they evacuated the entire building.
[220:45.04]I know, and in January too.
[220:46.44]My neighbors hated me.
[220:48.36]Yeah, they were pretty happy when we broke up.
[220:53.07]Yeah.
[220:53.99]God damn it.
[220:54.65]So, let's talk about what you found in Lee's office.
[220:59.17]Well, Lee clearly has issues with Norman Osborn.
[221:02.77]Yeah, but why?
[221:04.89]Chicken curry.
[221:05.46]I don't know yet.
[221:07.39]Beef stew.
[221:08.85]New York-style pizza.
[221:10.99]Cotton candy.
[221:15.75]No, I don't want that.
[221:16.97]That just climbed in there somehow.
[221:20.23]Spider-Gwen!
[221:20.75]Oh.
[221:38.78]not again Peter parker burning his house down hey it's your crime system thingy looks like a residential break-in Charles standish that sounds familiar so they didn't make a joke about how he can fight so much crime and solve all these mysteries but he can't figure out how to you don't think this does anything how to not overcook a chicken
[222:05.08]That suit.
[222:05.50]This is really so dumb.
[222:07.50]I forgot to open it!
[222:08.18]Ow!
[222:40.97]Change suit?
[222:41.67]No.
[222:51.23]Apparently, that's a tall building.
[222:53.34]Jump out of it.
[222:54.10]Oh, level up.
[222:55.44]Hey, it's me.
[222:57.04]This curry is legit.
[222:58.76]So what do we know about Charles Stanch?
[223:00.36]The man that I burnt?
[223:01.62]Let's see.
[223:02.40]Chief Financial Officer at Oscorp.
[223:04.96]Single.
[223:06.18]Known for his art collection.
[223:08.13]If Lee's after him, it's got to be related to Devil's Breath.
[223:11.49]Let's do this now.
[223:14.07]Let me know the second you find something.
[223:16.15]I think Lee might be planning something even worse than City Hall.
[223:19.49]So, are we partners now?
[223:21.49]Because it sure feels like we are.
[223:23.53]Partners.
[223:24.55]Sounds good.
[223:26.53]Web throw enemies without having to web them.
[223:31.81]I think so.
[223:32.42]I think the answer is yes.
[223:45.17]Wait, why are we getting oofs right now?
[223:49.71]You don't like my... Spider-Man cat burglar suit?
[223:53.51]Alright.
[223:57.59]Got a point.
[223:59.58]I don't think anything else costs one.
[224:01.24]That might be the only thing.
[224:02.66]No, this one does.
[224:05.06]More than a few.
[224:07.78]Stealth takedowns, more focus.
[224:10.48]Below how- I'll just get it.
[224:13.17]Makes things a little easier.
[224:18.24]Okay.
[224:19.10]So.
[224:21.96]You know what's doing it for me?
[224:23.49]I don't... It's the hands.
[224:25.53]It's just bare hands.
[224:26.35]Let's see.
[224:26.83]I don't need to web him up to throw him.
[224:32.33]Uh, no.
[224:46.32]Call this guy an ambulance.
[224:47.24]Hope they can help him.
[224:49.37]That's a hero.
[224:51.45]It's a pair of hands.
[224:55.37]I know.
[224:55.63]I'm a jerk.
[224:56.55]I have to activate the suit power.
[225:00.23]Ah, yep, yep, yep.
[225:01.49]There's a pigeon.
[225:03.53]Come on.
[225:04.83]He's a fast one.
[225:05.71]Oh, shit.
[225:06.21]He's going to get away.
[225:11.50]It is my responsibility to catch that pigeon.
[225:15.42]I can't.
[225:17.42]Get out of the fucking tree, Peter!
[225:19.06]Got him.
[225:35.45]Okay!
[225:40.60]And... gotta go this way.
[225:41.86]Let's get above the buildings here.
[225:49.35]Fast.
[225:49.83]Fast.
[225:51.03]Think fast.
[225:54.62]Think fast.
[225:55.12]Wanna know what that is?
[226:13.62]There you go goofy you got it Congratulations, you just won five hundred million dollars Which will be paid in installments of a tenth of a quarter of a of a five hundredth of a penny The payments start two hundred years from now
[226:43.92]That's pretending.
[226:45.30]And that's not even a legally binding contract.
[226:53.85]I didn't tell you what dollars they were.
[226:58.51]They were made up funny dollars that I just made up.
[227:02.23]Sorry.
[227:02.69]Alright, let's try this.
[227:04.21]I wonder how long this lasts.
[227:10.89]Actually lasts a pretty long time.
[227:25.61]It's over now.
[227:41.14]Up the water spout.
[227:43.16]Search the garage.
[227:44.90]What's in the garage?
[227:47.24]There's probably more of them inside.
[227:58.26]Let's make it happen.
[228:00.24]Park.
[228:03.52]I'm not gonna say it.
[228:04.22]Fuck it.
[228:05.66]Somebody was in a hurry.
[228:07.20]Spider-Man!
[228:12.55]Hello?
[228:13.81]You're hurt.
[228:14.99]I'm okay.
[228:16.07]Candy.
[228:16.29]Free candy.
[228:16.57]But you gotta find Mr. Standish.
[228:17.81]Fast.
[228:18.79]Those guys in the masks kidnapped him and forced him up to his place.
[228:21.87]He lives in the penthouse.
[228:23.05]Top floor.
[228:24.17]Okay, sit tight.
[228:24.99]What are you guys saying that for?
[228:27.49]This thing is awesome.
[228:29.15]This guy's just trying to run away.
[228:30.97]Cool.
[228:31.11]That was how we do it, as they say.
[229:13.29]King of the Ring.
[229:14.21]Is this a piece of shit?
[229:24.52]We good?
[229:26.98]We good?
[229:27.30]No.
[229:27.86]Underneath.
[229:51.47]Uh, I'm gonna use some abilities here, man.
[229:57.81]Ayyyyyy... Spit him around, man!
[230:08.96]Spit him!
[230:15.12]Is that guy hiding, or does he see web?
[230:19.87]I actually can't even tell.
[230:28.97]Oh, big guy.
[230:30.27]I got the upgrade, though.
[230:31.13]Should not be easy, should not be hard, is what I meant to say.
[230:35.97]And don't matter, he's instantly dead anyways.
[230:38.19]Oh, what a unit.
[230:53.52]Good fight.
[230:54.71]A for effort.
[230:57.07]What's next on the list?
[230:58.59]Elevator won't work.
[230:59.51]They know I'm here, but maybe I can sneak up through the elevator shaft.
[231:04.16]Let's go No, what a unit should be able to make it up to the penthouse from here Yeah, man Take him away
[231:24.95]Peek-a-zool with all these guys.
[231:26.73]Alright, so just a random door opens.
[231:29.27]I'm glad I'm playing that NES shooter game with the light gun.
[231:36.71]Just watch out for the civilian.
[231:39.41]Okay, almost there.
[231:39.89]Stay out of the light.
[231:55.61]Does that count as a light?
[232:03.33]Oh, there are little spotlights.
[232:14.20]It's creeping up here, though.
[232:15.26]Ah, spotlight, spotlight, spotlight.
[232:28.32]Alright, no spotlight straight ahead.
[232:30.32]Is that- is that- that elevator's coming down.
[232:31.72]Okay, well, whatever.
[232:41.10]Crush it.
[232:41.95]Almost there.
[232:50.63]Don't think I need to even go... Oh, Jesus!
[232:54.81]I'm fine.
[233:02.73]Get there.
[233:03.74]Get there, please.
[233:04.46]Sir.
[233:07.10]Thank you.
[233:08.20]Nice and easy.
[233:14.58]More of this?
[233:17.28]Oh, fuck it.
[233:20.74]Firebombs?
[233:21.68]Seriously?
[233:22.24]Move!
[233:23.60]Uh-oh.
[233:25.46]Not good.
[233:25.90]That's how you do it, man.
[233:28.26]You just run straight ahead.
[233:32.16]Fuck it.
[233:32.86]I'm not gonna wait.
[233:43.06]Excuse me.
[233:43.68]What?
[233:50.11]I don't remember it.
[233:53.01]It's written down in a book somewhere.
[233:58.02]That would be me.
[234:00.83]Wait.
[234:00.95]God damn it.
[234:01.39]Now the whole point... I thought I had this equipped, but I didn't.
[234:41.90]Actually, oh, actually ruined it.
[234:48.56]Whoa.
[235:10.24]Get the spiders out here.
[235:11.18]This one.
[235:23.77]That one.
[235:24.29]Anybody else?
[235:24.85]That's it.
[235:25.30]Okay, good.
[235:26.60]Take down destructor.
[235:27.50]Oh, that guy's dead now.
[235:29.38]There's no way he's alive.
[235:36.46]Okay, all clear.
[235:37.84]Hope Standish is alright.
[235:39.58]I'm gonna go straight through.
[235:40.74]Oh, I saved his life.
[235:44.14]Hey.
[235:46.28]Oh, great.
[235:46.88]Good guy.
[235:51.56]Uh... Demon swordsman... Vulnerable after they attack.
[236:00.33]Dodge their attack... Guys, I'd love to read this.
[236:04.11]Can't I, like, take, like, a Peter Parker pill?
[236:05.83]And slow down time or something?
[236:09.31]Here we go.
[236:28.43]Wrong guy.
[236:28.69]You know, that was the wrong guy.
[236:41.18]Alright, good.
[236:43.67]Who's left?
[236:44.41]Can I open the door now?
[236:50.09]He's gone.
[236:50.49]I thought he dropped out the window.
[236:52.88]It's safe now.
[236:54.36]What were they after?
[236:55.58]Just financial records.
[236:57.80]About Devil's Breath?
[236:58.98]How do you know about that?
[237:00.25]Why do they want it?
[237:01.35]I don't even know what it is.
[237:03.91]Mr. Osborn's been pouring money into it for years, but he keeps the whole project a secret.
[237:09.33]I'm the only one who has any record of it.
[237:11.51]Not anymore.
[237:12.43]It's laundry day for Spider-Man.
[237:13.55]Looks like they copied some records to a secure server.
[237:16.13]Payroll information.
[237:17.93]On a Dr. Isaac Delaney.
[237:20.19]Who is he?
[237:21.82]I honestly don't know.
[237:23.54]Down!
[237:24.24]Funny, because that's such a default Kane's turtleneck.
[237:31.56]That's not a high-quality turtleneck.
[237:47.34]Don't get crushed by one of these.
[237:51.28]You know, he's that guy.
[237:55.66]He's trying.
[237:57.54]He's curling up.
[237:58.82]You know that, right?
[238:03.86]No, don't let him fall.
[238:05.98]I thought about it.
[238:07.43]No.
[238:07.51]Let's get through the cutscene.
[238:09.29]Just fall slower.
[238:42.45]Hey, Yuri.
[238:43.75]You okay?
[238:44.95]Yeah.
[238:46.07]But I didn't get much out of Standish before these Sable guys stepped in and told me to back off.
[238:51.45]What's the deal?
[238:52.60]I get the sense all they care about is keeping him quiet.
[238:55.28]Because he knows about Devil's Breath.
[238:58.32]Right.
[238:59.16]Whatever the hell that is.
[239:00.36]I'm working on that.
[239:01.94]I think I just got a lead.
[239:04.26]A lead?
[239:05.09]You sound like a cop.
[239:06.65]Don't you mean Spider Cop?
[239:12.39]Uh, Yuri?
[239:13.95]That's fair.
[239:16.45]See, all of you guys that said that that was, oh, ha ha.
[239:20.47]You guys love that now.
[239:21.25]Peter, what happened with Standish?
[239:22.94]He's safe.
[239:24.24]Okay, good.
[239:24.62]I know you guys love that now.
[239:25.42]The demons?
[239:27.30]They were looking for a name.
[239:28.84]You got a pen?
[239:30.12]Yeah, go.
[239:30.90]Dr. Isaac Delaney.
[239:36.93]I want to do this.
[239:39.01]I have to do this.
[239:39.69]Where's the tallest point in the game?
[239:42.13]Let's go to the Empire State Building.
[239:45.27]I want to try to get 10 front flips.
[239:47.42]Or 10 back flips.
[239:48.02]I have some time to kill.
[239:53.70]Let's go for 10 back flips.
[239:55.74]I almost just said 10 back flips.
[239:59.75]Back flips and front flips together.
[240:07.94]Do the rock thing off the Empire State Building.
[240:17.01]Okay, so.
[240:22.69]I did that before, too.
[240:26.20]I just want to stand up on top of this thing.
[240:28.36]Like this.
[240:30.78]Okay, here we go.
[240:33.30]So let's try and go for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[240:37.46]Sorry to call so late.
[240:45.08]My mind's bursting with ideas.
[240:47.52]We've been thinking too small, Peter.
[240:49.92]Why replace missing limbs with facsimiles?
[240:54.74]I'm sorry, that was obnoxious.
[240:55.78]Let's try this again.
[240:56.48]Backflips this time.
[241:24.09]Time to check something out for me.
[241:25.93]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[241:29.12]Oh, you stupid fucking thing.
[241:31.60]I could call it the bomb squad, but if it's just some kid science project...
[241:36.33]Yeah, I know.
[241:37.09]Budget crisis, yada, yada, yada.
[241:39.19]Come on.
[241:40.13]Don't do that to me.
[241:41.75]Will you please check it out?
[241:45.21]There's the magic word.
[241:46.48]I hope it's some kid's science project.
[241:49.88]Man, I miss those days.
[241:51.92]School projects are so much easier than real life projects.
[241:54.58]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[241:55.28]That was 11.
[241:57.28]I don't think you can do more than 11 or 12.
[242:10.38]Spider cop is on the case.
[242:11.90]Look at that stupid emoji.
[242:15.96]Yeah, I know where the other missions are.
[242:17.60]High five?
[242:27.32]Wow.
[242:28.22]Jesus.
[242:39.45]Why does everybody hate Spider-Man so much?
[242:42.11]Shut up, freak.
[242:45.02]Nice to see you.
[242:49.24]What?
[242:49.92]Wait till mom sees this.
[242:51.32]Ooh, do the hand thing.
[243:02.52]point at people.
[243:03.30]Hey, it's me.
[243:04.29]See, just one guy.
[243:04.95]Apparently.
[243:05.25]One dick.
[243:05.83]Alright, let's go to the next mission.
[243:30.97]I'm getting close.
[243:32.09]I'm getting close to some big event.
[243:34.88]I can feel it.
[243:41.58]Like your shoes!
[243:43.70]Can you imagine walking down the street, and just to your left, right next to you, a guy just did a full swanton bomb, and then stood up, and waved.
[244:03.13]Yeah, I wouldn't even react to that.
[244:05.07]It's so much worse because this guy in his pajamas.
[244:15.32]Yeah, that's true.
[244:18.18]I missed the research token, but you know.
[244:20.54]Oh well.
[244:22.50]Can't win them all.
[244:44.45]I was like, buy it.
[244:45.21]I was having so much fun.
[244:46.49]One more.
[244:46.89]The crowd goes mild.
[244:59.56]Looks military grade.
[245:01.36]Weird.
[245:05.73]So you found one of my recon points.
[245:08.11]Dr. Doom?
[245:08.47]Who is this?
[245:10.03]Wrong question.
[245:11.26]The correct one is, can you stop the bombs I've planted?
[245:17.46]Mystery man's got recon points spread all over the city.
[245:20.18]Recon points around the city.
[245:20.96]Complete challenges to earn challenge tokens.
[245:23.16]Another token.
[245:28.72]Okay.
[245:30.84]So, yeah.
[245:32.23]Hold on.
[245:32.51]Bomb challenge.
[245:34.17]300 minimum score, amazing level, spectacular, ultimate.
[245:39.23]So if you get 12,000 points.
[245:40.19]300 is all you need, and it goes all the way up to 12,000.
[245:41.79]Well, let's try it.
[245:42.69]Okay.
[245:42.81]I'm assuming the time limit is disarm a few bombs.
[245:44.31]Oh, great.
[246:01.78]Hold L1 and R1 to dispose of the bomb when you're in range.
[246:07.76]Alright, you have to be really, really in range.
[246:12.13]How in range do you have to be?
[246:13.37]Okay, I get it.
[246:32.58]You have to be actually standing over here.
[246:37.82]One more on the dock, it looks like.
[246:48.77]Hold on, wait, what?
[247:03.51]Um, alright, so I guess I did it.
[247:07.85]So, it's based on ties.
[247:09.35]Alright.
[247:12.72]Cool.
[247:12.86]Who is this guy?
[247:35.15]We get to go to a Halloween- Find Delaney at the ESU Halloween party.
[247:40.07]I'm looking forward to this.
[247:41.77]This is gonna be fun.
[248:16.73]Damn it.
[248:16.95]It's hoping it would activate.
[248:19.07]So, Spider-Man.
[248:23.45]Grab a building.
[248:24.99]There's no points for me to grab, too.
[248:26.49]All units, all positions are in pursuit of masked parents with a bomb.
[248:30.40]Missed a call from Aunt May.
[248:32.06]Peter, I spoke to Miles' mother, and she loved the idea of him working here.
[248:36.00]The poor woman's grieving herself while trying to be strong for her son.
[248:41.14]She needs some time to just keep.
[248:43.62]And he needs to see that life's still worth living.
[248:47.67]Dress up as Spider-Man for the party.
[248:54.22]Well, I mean, I'm going to blend in real well like a really shitty Spider-Man costume.
[248:59.44]Right in the window.
[249:06.42]Make an entrance.
[249:07.26]And let's go.
[249:21.21]costume party trope.
[249:32.53]This seems like a fun place to be.
[249:35.10]Of course, if somebody has the default, I have the horse head on.
[249:39.30]So, he's either the T-Rex, the pterodactyl, or the astronaut.
[249:41.34]Okay.
[249:52.29]T-Rex pterodactyl or astronaut.
[249:55.37]Does that guy even have a costume on?
[249:59.53]Oh, okay, yeah.
[250:01.72]T-Rex.
[250:02.48]No, that's just Reptar from the Rugrats.
[250:08.78]What a great costume.
[250:10.00]Wow.
[250:10.14]Alright.
[250:23.21]Can I go in the dance party or something?
[250:26.25]Why are there a bunch of Reptars?
[250:32.00]Have it in the party.
[250:35.50]Night of a Thousand Ghouls.
[250:43.21]Alright, there we go.
[250:45.61]Nope.
[250:46.25]That's Electro.
[250:49.54]Hey.
[250:51.24]Nice costume, dude.
[250:52.52]Can I get a selfie?
[250:53.92]I gotta get a selfie with this guy.
[251:01.16]Where'd he go?
[251:01.60]What?
[251:03.60]There he is.
[251:04.10]I found him.
[251:04.58]They should have made him fat.
[251:06.32]He should have a big stomach.
[251:21.96]Okay.
[251:22.68]Got the picture of Spider-Man.
[251:23.64]Alright.
[251:25.80]He's not the guy that dresses Electro, right?
[251:27.99]Dude, where is RTX when you need it?
[251:35.17]I wish I could turn it on right now.
[251:37.57]I don't know if that's a tired joke at this point, but... It's actually kind of funny because...
[251:50.39]As, oh, in a Spider-Man game, people are dressed as Spider-Man.
[251:54.37]If you go to a Halloween party this big, I'm actually surprised there aren't more Spider-Man.
[252:04.12]There we go.
[252:05.32]There we go.
[252:07.52]Exactly.
[252:16.32]Am I allowed to punch this guy?
[252:21.21]Yeah, we just have to stand off.
[252:23.45]I don't see anybody this way.
[252:28.87]I swear, I forgot it was Halloween until I walked in here.
[252:33.65]Mysterio's mirrors.
[252:35.71]There he is.
[252:38.83]Excuse me.
[252:39.77]Are you Dr. Delaney?
[252:41.13]Oh, Spider-Man.
[252:42.51]My nemesis.
[252:43.91]You won't catch me this time.
[252:48.68]Oh no, smoke.
[252:50.20]Whatever will I do?
[252:51.08]This is going to be stupid, but I can't wait.
[252:53.78]This is the end for you, Spider-Man.
[252:56.32]Eventually one of these guys is going to hurt me, for real.
[252:58.68]Which one?
[252:59.80]Now I have you.
[253:06.39]Hey, what's wrong with you?
[253:07.71]I worked on that helmet for a week.
[253:10.11]I need to find Dr. Delaney.
[253:11.67]He's out in the party somewhere.
[253:13.58]Wouldn't you be like, holy shit, you're really Spider-Man?
[253:16.56]Smartass.
[253:20.65]Apparently not.
[253:26.66]I care more about your helmet than you do, Beau.
[253:28.68]You just witnessed Spider-Man.
[253:30.86]For real.
[253:31.36]I'm gonna get stuck in here.
[253:32.40]Thank God it's easy for morons like me.
[253:47.53]Find a way to the podium.
[253:49.77]That guy throwing down candy could be Dr. Delaney.
[253:52.37]Okay.
[253:53.01]Gotta find a way up there.
[253:55.62]Eat!
[253:56.26]Eat, my little children!
[253:58.90]Hi.
[253:59.42]I'm looking for Isaac Delaney.
[254:01.86]I think he's on the dance floor.
[254:04.52]There he is.
[254:05.02]The lizard in the lab coat.
[254:10.70]Hey!
[254:11.30]Over here!
[254:12.16]Yeah!
[254:17.81]I wish that was me.
[254:18.69]You know what I mean?
[254:19.65]Don't you wish you were that guy right now?
[254:22.75]The best part about Halloween is if you wear a mask like that, nobody knows.
[254:27.15]Nobody cares.
[254:28.19]Spider-Man!
[254:48.09]I need to know what happened.
[254:51.57]Does this stop?
[254:52.35]Does this stop?
[254:57.61]Will anyone break this up eventually?
[255:01.46]It didn't.
[255:07.98]It goes on forever.
[255:08.88]It's REAL SPIDER-MAN!
[255:18.24]I'm live streaming this.
[255:24.82]Somebody's like IRL streaming right now and they just caught Spider-Man.
[255:28.43]Congratulations.
[255:29.17]Your stream just got on the front page of every single Reddit.
[255:45.53]Yeah, every single... That would be on the front page of our dogs and stuff.
[255:50.51]Well...
[256:14.10]And away we... ACTIVATE!
[256:16.68]Don't kill this guy?
[256:18.84]Why wouldn't he want that?
[256:25.75]Alright.
[256:26.01]Don't fight these guys in the air, alright?
[256:43.68]Wow, he dodged.
[256:45.54]Surprising.
[256:53.86]Everybody okay?
[256:54.52]You good?
[256:55.18]Yeah.
[256:57.02]Good.
[256:58.14]Uh, happy Halloween.
[257:02.73]I'm off.
[257:03.17]Happy Halloween, guys.
[257:04.71]It is pretty close to Halloween, isn't it?
[257:07.57]I mean, like a year.
[257:14.43]Use electric web.
[257:18.38]Yes, I know.
[257:19.20]Kill the lights.
[257:31.05]You didn't see shit.
[257:31.95]Oh, come on, man.
[257:36.15]Really?
[257:49.16]He's got a spotlight on me now, that's not good.
[257:51.52]Oh shit, that hurt.
[257:58.24]Wrap him up.
[258:14.46]Oh, wait a minute.
[258:16.50]What if I... Whoa, that was kind of brutal.
[258:18.78]That looked like it hurt a lot.
[258:23.37]Back to school.
[258:24.05]Search for Delaney.
[258:30.51]Must be another way around.
[258:31.93]We're going through here.
[258:43.87]There's Dr. Delaney.
[258:45.09]Don't say anything.
[258:45.91]Shh.
[258:46.03]I'll put my finger up.
[258:47.19]Shh.
[258:47.31]Don't say anything.
[258:49.62]Where are you taking me?
[258:58.52]Dr. Delaney, I'm coming for you.
[259:09.07]Go forward now.
[259:11.97]Who are you?
[259:12.85]You recently began working with someone in an Oscorp lab.
[259:16.81]How do you know that?
[259:17.39]We don't have much time, Isaac.
[259:19.59]Tell me his name.
[259:20.65]Just one second.
[259:21.25]Can I use your handkerchief for one second?
[259:24.14]I was watching a stream earlier and it was a really funny joke.
[259:37.80]Show's over, Lee.
[259:45.99]Apparently the show's not over.
[259:47.47]That was from the trailer.
[259:56.25]His name, Dr. Morgan Michaels.
[260:05.24]Thank you.
[260:06.36]Mr. Negative.
[260:10.64]No!
[260:16.74]Did that just happen in a game with a grade of T?
[260:28.44]Huh.
[260:34.77]Let's go!
[260:38.95]Ahh, back to you, back to you.
[260:52.03]That is very useful.
[261:12.24]Take out the big guy.
[261:13.08]Nooo!
[261:13.46]I want to get the big guy with the execution.
[261:14.76]Oh well.
[261:18.12]I tried.
[261:45.89]Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes.
[261:48.31]I'll just shock him.
[261:50.71]Soup?
[261:53.47]What about soups?
[261:59.06]Nine of thousand ghouls.
[262:15.75]I like how the effects look, yeah.
[262:19.29]Everything seems very meticulous.
[262:21.81]Which is a good thing.
[262:24.79]I wonder if this is the boss fight with Mr. Negative.
[262:31.36]Oh no, it's just gonna be a brawl.
[262:33.30]Yeah.
[262:35.44]It's just chaos.
[262:36.18]I need to stop them from hurting each other.
[262:45.52]Well, I just kick all their asses.
[262:47.28]No, don't hurt each other.
[262:51.94]Let me just break your skulls.
[262:53.42]It helps.
[262:53.88]I felt bad doing that.
[262:55.00]Uh-oh.
[263:04.06]There's the rhino boss fight.
[263:05.20]What about that guy again?
[263:11.68]Believe me, this is for your own good.
[263:25.28]Okay, we just got the rhino dude.
[263:33.96]Quick.
[263:37.32]Oh, no.
[263:38.47]We're actually gonna ride around.
[263:40.35]Okay, we good?
[263:46.37]Everybody snapped out of it?
[263:50.45]Yuri, I need your help.
[263:51.82]I've got reports of shots fired at ESU.
[263:54.14]Yeah, that's me.
[263:55.26]I'll explain later.
[263:56.32]But right now, you need to find a Dr. Morgan Michaels.
[263:59.14]Martin Lee's coming after him.
[264:00.94]Copy that.
[264:09.57]Back to school.
[264:12.27]Spider-Man, who is this Dr. Michaels?
[264:15.27]I think he's the head scientist on this Devil's Breath project.
[264:17.99]Did you find him?
[264:19.34]Yes and no.
[264:20.82]Sable says they have him under protection at a safe house somewhere in the city.
[264:24.54]But they won't tell me where.
[264:26.44]I thought you guys were working together.
[264:28.48]So did I. Okay.
[264:30.70]I have an idea on how to find him.
[264:31.89]I'll let you know if it works.
[264:35.35]Okay.
[264:39.55]New suit.
[264:41.99]This is fear itself.
[264:47.37]Assistive Nano Musculature temporarily deals massive damage.
[264:54.03]Interesting.
[264:58.31]I can't even make it anyways.
[265:02.41]This one looks pretty cool, though.
[265:07.06]This is just the evolved Pokémon of this one.
[265:10.50]You know?
[265:18.88]But let me take a... Dude, I'm just like drinking water.
[265:23.60]I'm gonna take another pee.
[265:24.28]I'll be right back.
[265:28.83]I'm like on the clock here every two hours peeing.
[265:32.67]Because I'm drinking a bunch of water.
[265:40.72]Thank God I'm hydrating.
[265:44.62]I'm not drinking too much water.
[265:45.78]Just enough.
[265:46.80]Could be to go to the bathroom every two hours.
[265:50.71]Two hours and 10 minutes.
[265:52.06]We've been streaming for four and a half hours, right?
[265:53.60]Four hours and 25 minutes.
[265:54.20]Alright, be right back.
[268:23.52]Alright.
[268:27.66]Let's move back to the game.
[268:33.63]Hello again, everybody.
[268:40.87]Probably the same deal as last night.
[268:42.81]We'll go for like a couple missions.
[268:46.03]Go for another 30-40 minutes.
[268:47.87]Do the bits.
[268:50.60]After that.
[268:51.68]And then do it again tomorrow.
[268:56.24]We're going to stream again tomorrow.
[268:57.94]Spider-Man again, I'm going to assume.
[269:01.82]I do not think we're going to get to the end of it tonight.
[269:04.51]And then we will reassess tomorrow after the stream.
[269:14.13]We'll see tomorrow how far I am and if I'm going to continue to stream Spider-Man.
[269:20.90]We'll see.
[269:26.57]new mods increase damage when your health is above a hundred if you don't take any hits slow time after a perfect dodge kind of already does that anyways does it I I want that I'm willing to give this up the heat I want the heel I want the hill to be better
[269:57.54]I guess these kind of negate themselves, don't they?
[269:59.65]It reduces your melee damage, and now I'm healing more.
[270:02.47]Isn't that kind of just the same thing in a different way?
[270:05.57]Hmm.
[270:19.31]I'll try it.
[270:30.64]one generates focus I guess I can leave it on the thing that generates focus with the gadgets we'll see how much I miss it speaking of gadgets we can max out this or we can impact web knocks enemies further back yeah just like this one too much
[270:57.55]Spider Drone needs to be... And Chris Mack shots with this gadget.
[271:00.35]Yeah, let's get it.
[271:02.29]They're fun to use.
[271:05.91]Can't afford it.
[271:07.43]Can't afford it.
[271:08.33]Can't afford it.
[271:09.99]Cannot afford it.
[271:13.77]Two points.
[271:16.89]Thrown objects damage all nearby enemies.
[271:19.38]That's pretty good.
[271:22.71]But is it what I want now?
[271:23.97]Rifles.
[271:24.73]Pulling rifles away could be very important.
[271:26.61]Slow time just before you take a fatal hit.
[271:35.38]While in the air, I can yank an enemy up.
[271:39.60]That's pretty good.
[271:46.72]I'll just finish this.
[271:48.58]I like throwing stuff.
[271:56.29]I don't think you've ever pulled a gun.
[271:58.61]I did it once.
[271:59.13]I just don't do it because I gotta get the other one that you can pull assault rifles.
[272:04.50]Because then I'll actually start doing it.
[272:05.68]We will.
[272:05.96]Before Delaney died, he gave Lee a name.
[272:07.70]Morgan Michaels.
[272:19.65]Morgan Michaels.
[272:21.21]Who is he?
[272:22.37]Not sure, but I bet he works on the Devil's Breath project.
[272:25.93]Have you learned anything from that Devil's Breath file?
[272:28.73]Yeah, get this.
[272:29.87]A few years ago, Osborn came to Fisk and asked him to build a lab, but to keep his friends from regulators.
[272:35.62]Secret lab.
[272:38.71]As dangerous as we think it is, I can see why.
[272:41.31]Where's the lab?
[272:42.41]It's not in the file.
[272:44.15]Osborn made Fisk destroy all records of it.
[272:46.77]All I have are invoices from Osborn's personal account to Fisk Construction.
[272:50.96]Knowing Fisk, he kept the invoices around for blackmail material on the mayor.
[272:54.56]I love that so much.
[272:55.16]Everything leads back to Norman Osborn.
[272:56.60]It's so much fun.
[272:57.56]Guess it's time to pay him a visit.
[272:59.86]Norman, time to turn into the Green Goblin.
[273:01.66]Here it comes.
[273:02.06]I wasn't planning to ask.
[273:09.63]Alright, Norman.
[273:12.13]Let's see what you have.
[273:14.43]Okay, that's how I can get into Norman's office.
[273:17.51]Can't get in there without shutting down some security systems.
[273:21.18]But if they see me, they'll put the whole place on lockdown.
[273:27.84]Stealth mission?
[273:28.44]Maybe I should change my suit.
[273:31.13]I should be able to hack into the security network modules from the outside.
[273:40.91]I wonder if it's worth putting the other suit on.
[273:47.97]They're the network cables.
[273:49.29]Just need to follow them to the security module.
[273:53.53]Follow the cables.
[273:54.45]Follow the cables.
[273:57.86]There we go.
[273:58.60]A security module.
[274:00.12]Looks like there's four of these around the building.
[274:04.48]That should make things easier.
[274:05.84]What the hell?
[274:06.36]Security teams, call in.
[274:11.13]Sable Team Alpha standing by.
[274:13.17]Looks like an electrical problem.
[274:14.81]Copy that.
[274:15.79]Keep an eye on the exterior while we try to track down the issue.
[274:18.60]Just when I thought it would be easy.
[274:22.12]Let's put it on.
[274:22.88]At least we can feel like we're invisible.
[274:33.19]Where is it?
[274:34.11]Enemies no longer call for backup when alerted.
[274:46.50]Enemies take longer to detect you in stealth.
[274:48.36]I can't make it!
[274:50.62]Shit.
[274:53.37]Oh well.
[274:56.65]Well... Okay.
[275:01.19]So nothing changed, I just look different.
[275:10.55]Watch out for the lasers.
[275:14.48]I can't even see myself.
[275:20.41]Oh shit!
[275:20.89]Get it.
[275:21.09]I'm holding R1.
[275:21.71]Hack it!
[275:22.45]What?
[275:22.61]Oh my god.
[275:52.15]When Jerma's voice cracks and he does it again to pretend it was on purpose.
[275:55.44]What?
[275:55.62]Did my voice crack?
[275:56.10]When?
[275:56.32]Sometimes you just gotta go.
[276:21.39]Table teams.
[276:22.23]I need a status report.
[276:23.75]Exterior sweep negative.
[276:25.31]We are all clear.
[276:26.87]Still look like a software issue?
[276:28.63]We don't know.
[276:29.07]We're evaluating.
[276:30.51]Please maintain current alert level.
[276:35.29]Okay.
[276:35.81]Just two more modules.
[276:37.14]Oh, my God.
[276:38.78]My God.
[276:39.16]My God.
[276:39.50]My God.
[276:39.82]My God.
[276:40.18]My God.
[276:40.70]Target spotted.
[276:41.92]It's Spider-Man.
[276:46.54]Alright.
[276:47.88]If you get spotted, it's over.
[276:49.00]Don't rush it.
[276:49.86]Slow down.
[276:59.50]Just get through it.
[277:00.68]Stop rushing.
[277:01.60]Stop doing that.
[277:03.20]Exterior sweep negative.
[277:04.78]We are all clear.
[277:06.31]Stop it.
[277:06.57]Sounds like a software issue.
[277:08.13]We don't know.
[277:08.93]We're evaluating.
[277:10.03]Please maintain current alert level.
[277:14.81]Okay, just two more modules.
[277:17.29]Attention all Sable teams.
[277:19.11]There's a small possibility we have a trespasser on site.
[277:22.12]We're analyzing data now.
[277:23.86]Stay vigilant.
[277:25.02]Copy that, Control.
[277:29.89]What the heck?
[277:30.45]You're at a box right now, man.
[277:31.93]You were just at the box.
[277:32.93]And where was the prompt?
[277:37.91]Okay, R1.
[277:40.29]Oh my god.
[277:41.35]Do not.
[277:42.09]Don't you dare.
[277:42.67]I need a team to scan the 85th floor exterior.
[277:46.45]Copy control.
[277:47.33]Bird inbound.
[277:48.05]Alright, we're good.
[277:52.55]Last one.
[277:53.95]Gotta move.
[277:56.70]Hi, MJ.
[277:57.00]A little busy right now.
[277:58.37]I'll be quick.
[277:59.61]Listen, I got a lead on Charles Standish's location.
[278:02.05]I think if I can get to him, I can make him talk.
[278:04.35]He knew about Dr. Delaney.
[278:05.63]He probably knows about Morgan Michaels as well.
[278:07.98]Okay, just don't do anything crazy.
[278:11.60]Speaking of crazy, I gotta find that last module.
[278:29.28]What the hell is it?
[278:30.44]I ran right by it.
[278:33.61]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[278:42.45]Target spotted.
[278:43.43]What?
[278:43.71]It's Spider-Man.
[278:45.05]Alright, just get me back to where I was.
[278:46.57]Damn, I went the wrong goddamn way.
[278:55.63]Do the rock ability.
[278:56.79]No.
[278:57.71]When I fail, maybe.
[279:02.23]What is it?
[279:02.53]Why are you bringing it down here?
[279:05.95]Where does it go?
[279:06.45]Fucking god.
[279:07.27]Where is it?
[279:07.91]Why is it not here?
[279:08.51]Am I not close enough now?
[279:33.66]Wait for it to pass again I went right through it and holy shit.
[279:48.73]Holy shit.
[279:49.23]I got so lucky I don't know why they didn't see me.
[279:52.61]I have no idea.
[279:53.87]I couldn't it's fine.
[279:55.79]Who cares?
[279:56.61]There's the last one hack it hack it.
[279:58.67]Oh
[280:04.52]The stealth suit, yes.
[280:07.02]That guy was probably looking at the chat.
[280:13.04]I know what that's like, man.
[280:16.70]Everybody in that guy's stream was just like, what are you?
[280:19.13]Oh, blind.
[280:20.17]What, are you serious?
[280:22.13]How did you not see him?
[280:23.91]And he looked back from chat.
[280:24.99]He's like, oh, fuck.
[280:26.07]I just think I didn't see it.
[280:43.05]Hold on.
[280:43.75]Switching to a secure line.
[280:45.60]I'm way ahead of you, Wilson.
[280:47.14]I had my people go through all your files.
[280:49.92]Try to expose our business arrangement.
[280:51.86]It'll be your word against mine.
[280:53.54]And I'm not the one behind bars right now.
[280:56.21]Wait.
[280:57.27]Is Norman talking to Wilson Fisk?
[280:59.81]Neo statue.
[281:01.39]What are you talking about?
[281:02.33]The Neo statue from the auction house.
[281:05.41]They must be talking about that file MJ found.
[281:07.95]Who has the file?
[281:09.23]We do, Norman.
[281:10.59]But it doesn't tell us enough.
[281:12.29]Which is why I'm doing some slightly illegal but morally acceptable B&E right now.
[281:17.10]Bad guys?
[281:17.58]Jackpot.
[281:19.40]Bad guys.
[281:21.36]Access his computer.
[281:22.16]GR-27.
[281:25.58]We do, Norman.
[281:31.14]Dr. Morgan Michaels is the chief scientist, but the location of the lab is redacted.
[281:36.26]Hmm.
[281:37.96]AI-controlled CRISPRs.
[281:40.54]If that actually works, it could cure any genetic disease.
[281:44.82]Cystic fibrosis?
[281:45.92]Huntington's?
[281:46.96]This is crazy.
[281:48.80]Hmm.
[281:51.16]The good.
[281:52.40]What's the bad?
[281:53.98]The bad?
[281:55.80]Viral deliberate mechanism incorrectly targets immune system.
[281:59.39]infected subjects highly contagious one subject exposed seven days later all 40 subjects deceased creepy well that's kind of a fucked up image wow the ugly one infected subject could trigger a global epidemic it's designed to cure diseases but in its current form it's like a bioweapon
[282:26.02]Dr. Michaels keeps the only sample with him at all times.
[282:29.46]That's why Lee wants him.
[282:31.26]We find Michaels, we find Devil's Breath.
[282:36.27]This sounds easy.
[282:47.01]Why would you make that presentation?
[282:48.55]You can't just go in the back, go in the bathroom, in the back room or something and tell somebody that?
[282:54.93]That's like a, hey, we're in the bathroom.
[282:56.95]The third guy that was in here with us just left.
[282:58.91]I got something to tell you, man.
[283:01.95]Hey, Pete.
[283:06.54]What's up?
[283:08.48]MJ, get this.
[283:10.02]Devil's Breath wasn't designed to be a weapon.
[283:12.34]It's a treatment for genetic disorders.
[283:14.58]But its current form is wildly imperfect.
[283:16.95]In trying to fix the body, it rips it apart.
[283:19.71]We need to locate Dr. Michaels.
[283:21.67]I don't trust Sable to contain something this deadly.
[283:24.68]Alright, let's go.
[283:25.20]Meet me in the bathroom, Larry.
[283:27.72]I've got something to tell you.
[283:28.82]Whoa, whoa, take pictures.
[283:29.88]There's a lot of photo opportunities here.
[283:32.62]Oh, I'm missing these.
[283:34.18]Where?
[283:54.32]Oh, right there.
[283:57.43]Oh, he missed.
[283:59.37]You set me free!
[284:00.65]I'll set you free, too!
[284:05.49]Don't kill him, right?
[284:06.15]You just kinda have to let him... He needs a doctor, not a jail cell.
[284:09.97]I'll make sure he gets one.
[284:10.86]Got a landmark.
[284:13.04]Looks like Doc checked in.
[284:14.86]Peter, I've had an epiphany.
[284:17.58]It's all about the mind.
[284:20.60]No!
[284:31.01]In developing our neural interface, we need to think beyond replicating the tired putterings of our physical forms.
[284:37.33]Instead, reach into imagination and possibility.
[284:41.45]Reach into the mind.
[284:43.53]Nice pick.
[284:43.83]I've never heard Doc this excited by a project.
[284:46.64]He's not too excited.
[284:47.90]We'll probably finish up here in this next mission.
[284:51.90]Whatever this next mission is, it'll probably be the last one for tonight.
[284:55.22]And we will start again tomorrow.
[285:00.74]Never finished this application for the coffee bean would have paid more than what I'm doing now Can I do to think of one point yeah, I can might as well get it press X during a roll after landing to launch back into the air I
[285:28.86]Curious to see the land at first Like that that's cool That's very very cool take the camera off what the hell am I doing?
[285:54.37]Yeah
[286:00.42]Ready?
[286:00.66]Here we go.
[286:02.24]Woo!
[286:03.12]All units advised.
[286:04.08]We have a reported assault in progress.
[286:06.58]Officers needed in Central Park.
[286:13.45]Roll again.
[286:15.31]Can I just keep doing it?
[286:17.43]Yeah, you can just leapfrog.
[286:21.88]Report of a mugging.
[286:23.04]Weapon drawn.
[286:23.62]Need an officer on scene.
[286:24.80]We'll probably call for tonight.
[286:29.36]Where are you, MJ?
[286:31.84]I will say at night.
[286:33.01]Crap.
[286:34.93]The noir suit at... No.
[286:36.69]Oh, damn it.
[286:38.17]We're going to have to do another one of these.
[286:40.21]Reach him.
[286:41.19]That place is crawling with guards.
[286:42.79]How are you trying to reach him?
[286:45.15]Very, very quietly.
[286:47.89]Better go, partner.
[286:49.66]Okay.
[286:50.18]The stand is just somewhere in there.
[286:51.88]Gotta get past that guard.
[286:55.94]Time to see if these lorespeed gave me work.
[286:59.36]Ending on a high note.
[287:02.06]I'm gonna do it quick.
[287:05.44]That gap in the fence looks promising.
[287:07.26]You just need to distract the guard.
[287:09.28]I have, I think, the thing, the L2 and aim, and then you hit him in the throat and hit him in the head.
[287:19.51]Out of the way, fella.
[287:20.85]What was that?
[287:21.57]Gotta move.
[287:26.01]Now.
[287:29.52]Houseguest must be standish.
[287:35.12]He's here somewhere See ya Mary Jane you can run faster than that What's that you just can't demons are killing anyone related to devil's breath I
[287:57.10]Hmm.
[287:58.36]He's in danger.
[287:59.44]Now let's... Okay, I'm going to lure, sprint right to the front door.
[288:04.93]They're metal stairs?
[288:11.33]So just jump.
[288:13.43]Jump.
[288:13.77]Hold on a second.
[288:14.37]Let me show you something.
[288:16.33]If you put your back against here...
[288:18.96]And you did a little one-two jump as hard as you can.
[288:23.13]You could jump over that and land on the grass and roll.
[288:26.69]You didn't make any noise.
[288:28.07]Why would that make noise?
[288:29.61]See?
[288:30.03]That didn't make any noise.
[288:30.73]You want a Mario game?
[288:32.33]I could do that.
[288:55.99]Maybe I'll prove it to you one day.
[289:03.25]Oh god, what am I doing up there?
[289:19.65]Shit in my pants.
[289:25.82]We're good.
[289:26.82]Sorry, I was just at the dentist.
[289:35.79]They didn't give me Novocaine.
[289:37.53]I'm just ripping teeth out.
[289:38.75]It's kind of fucked up, actually.
[289:39.97]I don't know why they did that right there.
[289:41.19]Okay, here we go.
[289:41.69]Knock it over.
[289:42.13]Don't come this way.
[289:42.95]Good.
[289:52.29]Oh my fucking god.
[289:53.41]What do I do?
[289:54.57]What do I do?
[289:55.41]Oh, I know what to do.
[290:01.83]Why is that not working on you?
[290:03.59]Go over there.
[290:07.97]Um... Dude.
[290:09.17]Fucking god damn mother.
[290:21.76]Just...
[290:30.41]Looks important.
[290:31.97]Quick!
[290:32.13]Safe houses.
[290:33.57]If Dr. Michaels is in one of these, Standish might know which one.
[290:38.53]There's Standish's tent.
[290:39.97]Can't believe Michaels just carries Devil's Breath around with him.
[290:43.26]Osborn doesn't trust anyone else to secure it.
[290:45.96]Hope his ego doesn't bite him in the ass.
[290:48.12]Or us.
[290:49.30]Control, I heard something.
[290:51.22]Running a sweep.
[290:51.86]No, I actually should have done this.
[290:56.18]Again?
[290:56.94]What's up with these lights?
[290:59.77]Alpha team, stay alert.
[291:01.89]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, none of you, none of you, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, none of you, none of you, none of you, none of you, good.
[291:09.01]That landed right on me.
[291:24.42]Stay alert.
[291:25.34]I think we got company.
[291:27.66]Come on, come on.
[291:32.87]I need both now.
[291:37.76]You both have to go that way.
[291:41.26]You can clearly just see somebody throw something.
[291:42.98]I gotta turn him around.
[291:48.16]He'll turn and I'm just gonna go right behind him.
[292:01.26]Cancel that control.
[292:02.42]Sector clear.
[292:07.50]Is somebody over here?
[292:08.18]Hmm.
[292:11.40]Um.
[292:12.04]Control.
[292:13.06]We're all clear.
[292:13.61]Eyes up.
[292:14.09]Heads on the swivel.
[292:15.95]There's nobody over there, right?
[292:17.37]This guy though.
[292:18.17]Guys.
[292:23.15]Might have something.
[292:23.83]Control.
[292:24.39]Stand by.
[292:30.98]I made it.
[292:37.82]Just smashed through the boxes.
[292:39.26]Oh, that's so nerve-wracking.
[292:46.13]Charles Standish?
[292:47.33]Holy crap!
[292:48.97]Charles, where is Dr. Morgan Michaels?
[292:52.87]Lee sent you, didn't he?
[292:55.97]No.
[292:58.21]Found him.
[293:01.68]He wants to kill me?
[293:02.32]You told him to do it.
[293:04.94]Do it himself.
[293:05.46]I'm not with the demons.
[293:07.18]I'm not with Sable.
[293:09.26]I'm a reporter.
[293:14.38]And I want to see Lee stopped.
[293:16.68]Just like you.
[293:18.46]What?
[293:20.31]Wait a minute.
[293:20.73]I recognize that.
[293:21.43]I've read your byline.
[293:22.43]You pulled that off a Cheerios box.
[293:23.91]If I scan that, it'll say $4.99.
[293:25.03]Bang!
[293:27.03]She has Michaels in the Bowery.
[293:28.07]They're moving him to a new safe house tomorrow at noon.
[293:30.45]But she's totally ignoring Grand Central.
[293:32.50]Grand Central?
[293:33.86]The demons were talking about it when they held me.
[293:36.40]They're going there to get... To get what, Charles?
[293:40.86]What do the demons need to get at Grand Central?
[293:44.80]What the... Charles!
[293:46.84]Oh!
[293:46.98]What the hell?
[293:48.05]That was not a sable guy.
[293:49.05]Definitely not a sable guy.
[293:51.81]Sorry, Charlie.
[293:55.40]I don't work for Sable.
[293:56.48]Here's my gamer license from Blockbuster.
[294:06.81]I swear I don't work for Sable.
[294:09.01]Here's my Costco card.
[294:22.91]So that's it, huh?
[294:25.30]Okay.
[294:26.20]Well, that was maybe the most awkward swing of my life.
[294:28.92]MJs are not happy.
[294:31.06]Yeah!
[294:32.90]Level up!
[294:36.34]They just do that automatically when you level up.
[294:38.54]What were they thinking?
[294:40.02]Hey, okay, another thing.
[294:41.64]Sorry, Charlie.
[294:43.60]You knock a man out, destroy my background research, and the best you've got is sorry, Charlie?
[294:49.08]Is everything a joke to you?
[294:50.71]What?
[294:50.91]MJ?
[294:50.97]No, I screwed up.
[294:52.91]It was a tension breaker.
[294:55.05]Tension breaker, right.
[294:57.38]You know this is exactly why we broke up.
[294:59.80]I thought we broke up so you could focus on your career.
[295:03.24]I broke up because you wouldn't stop treating me like a baby.
[295:05.83]Don't do this, MJ.
[295:07.29]Don't do that, MJ.
[295:08.49]Oh, that's too dangerous, MJ.
[295:10.11]I may not have super spider powers, but I'm not made out of glass.
[295:14.47]You snuck into the middle of an armed military... You know what?
[295:17.49]Can we not do this right now, please?
[295:19.79]I feel like you probably would.
[295:21.04]Have you ever seen Spider-Man sit down?
[295:23.86]Fine.
[295:25.52]Michaels is in the Bowery somewhere.
[295:27.26]Sable's moving him tomorrow at noon.
[295:29.63]awesome anything else is he saying something about grand central before I jumped in he was no it was nothing listen I gotta go Peter filing deadline I love that move Peter that's how you know she's still mad oh hi guys nice work Mr. superhero alright I think I'm gonna uh call it here I'm worked up gotta blow off some steam on patrol
[295:58.26]But I'm still having a great time.
[295:59.72]This is still just as fun as it was yesterday.
[296:01.96]This game's great.
[296:05.24]So we're gonna stop it here.
[296:06.92]And we're gonna do the bits, we're gonna do the subs.
[296:13.13]And we'll pick up again tomorrow.
[296:21.37]You let the shitty stealth mission be the last one.
[296:23.41]That's not the last one.
[296:25.83]We're gonna do it again tomorrow.
[296:34.89]Oh, God.
[296:35.55]Lorag comes in with $50 here at the end.
[296:37.39]Thank you, Lorag98, for the $50.
[296:39.07]Haven't given bits in a while.
[296:41.15]How's it going?
[296:42.37]It's going great.
[296:42.77]Thank you so much, Lorag.
[296:43.43]Thank you for the incredibly generous $50 bit damage.
[297:04.83]So that's a good place to stop right here.
[297:06.17]I'm just going to manually save it because why not?
[297:10.91]Just because in case something goes wrong.
[297:12.75]Okay.
[297:12.85]She's talking.
[297:19.76]We'll let her finish.
[297:20.50]Okay.
[297:44.27]Spoilers?
[297:46.33]Spoils?
[297:47.53]No spoilers.
[297:48.25]No spoilers.
[297:48.96]Wait, hold on.
[297:51.78]Of course.
[297:52.10]I'll look into it.
[297:53.52]Thanks.
[297:54.08]I'll look into it.
[297:54.82]You know what that means, guys.
[297:56.48]It means I'm not going to do it.
[297:58.02]That's what that means.
[298:15.65]I'll look into that.
[298:25.77]Alright.
[298:28.17]Thank you everybody for watching.
[298:29.93]I'll see you tomorrow if you're taking off.

[298:55.25]So I'll be taking off.
[298:55.85]See you tomorrow or next time whenever you come back.

[303:10.90]Greetings from Italy.
[303:11.78]Greetings.
[303:12.70]From... America.
[303:16.52]Specifically New England.
[303:18.94]When's the stream gonna start tomorrow?
[303:21.04]Probably... Mmm.
[303:26.90]Whenever I wake up and get going and have lunch and get out and get ready.
[303:30.40]Because I'm gonna want to play Spider-Man again.
[303:33.54]So.
[303:34.70]It's whenever I get down here.
[303:36.14]Which that could be between... Three, four-ish...
[303:41.82]Probably around the same time it started today.
[303:43.30]Remember, I told you, I'm trying to get into a mode where I'm streaming at 3 or 4 p.m.
[303:53.79]Because if you weren't here earlier, I'm going to start streaming Pacific Time 3 or 4 p.m.
[304:01.09]to make sure that the schedule doesn't necessarily change that much.
[304:05.18]Set suster around 4.
[304:06.18]Yeah, that works.
[304:10.24]4 o'clock is definitely, I'll be live by then.
[304:15.14]Eastern.
[304:17.60]Thanks a lot.
[304:20.05]But, uh, Androx, thanks for the $1.
[304:21.51]Thank you.
[304:22.11]Goldy969, 967 is your name.
[304:26.57]Thanks for the $1, dude.
[304:27.43]Jerma, the shirt should say Jerma and then 985 instead of 17.
[304:31.96]I'd buy it if it were merch.
[304:32.96]This was a, uh, if you just went to TwitchCon and you were a Twitch partner, you got one of these.
[304:39.39]So that's pretty much all it is.
[304:41.13]I didn't buy it or anything.
[304:43.91]They just had it for the partners, whoever you were.
[304:46.39]Just kind of went up to a kiosk and claimed it.
[304:52.95]But thank you, The Doctor, forever.
[304:55.21]Thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the $1.
[304:57.69]Time zones are really weird, yes.
[304:59.65]But did you know until 1859, every place on Earth had the same time?
[305:04.74]A man by the name of Ivan...
[305:07.02]Mikhailovich Perov traveled to Japan and noticed more hours than usually passed.
[305:13.42]So in an attempt to adjust the time he lost, he created time zones, visiting each capital city and telling them to change their time.
[305:21.17]The sun got wind of that and started to circle the Earth, so the day and night cycle still made sense.
[305:29.28]25 hours a day in Japan.
[305:33.76]Thank you.
[305:34.80]Thank you, SmithSmith, for the $1.
[305:36.71]Hey, Jerma, you should check out Beat Saber.
[305:42.33]Here's a video of it.
[305:49.05]Beat Saber would be fun.
[305:49.95]I just need something.
[305:50.87]Can you play Beat Saber on PS4?
[305:52.68]I'd probably throw up playing this, though.
[305:56.84]I would do maybe an hour of this, and I would puke.
[306:11.04]But I definitely want to do more VR.
[306:16.56]I do it in... I do VR in waves.
[306:21.92]Because I'd wait for... Oh, look, there's three or four interesting actual games you can play with VR.
[306:33.94]More VR.
[306:34.84]You'll see it again.
[306:37.84]Beat Saber looks really cool, though.
[306:39.51]Some people can do some crazy shit with Beat Saber.
[306:47.73]Beat Saber is great fitness trading.
[306:49.27]It looks like it, and it looks really clean, and it looks very responsive.
[306:52.35]It's a blast.
[306:56.95]You can make maps and stuff.
[306:58.15]That's so cool.
[307:03.54]Thank you, SmithSmith.
[307:04.40]I will definitely check it out.
[307:06.32]We'll probably try to play it
[307:08.74]But every month goes by, the Vive is just out of reach.
[307:15.52]I'm playing fishing with streams, and the big fish at the bottom is the Vive, and I stop halfway through and I grab the lie detector.
[307:24.80]And I don't go down to the Vive.
[307:35.51]But, yeah.
[307:39.20]Anywho, thank you.
[307:40.10]Thank you to Jeff with a PH.
[307:42.78]Thanks for the $1.
[307:43.70]My name Jeff.
[307:44.82]And he spelled it with two PHs.
[307:47.60]Okay.
[307:50.31]Turn up the volume right now.
[307:53.97]Gave a dollar.
[307:54.57]Thank you, dude.
[307:56.99]Div USP.
[307:57.83]Thanks for the three bucks.
[307:58.81]No message.
[307:59.29]Thank you.
[308:01.39]GK9999.
[308:01.63]Thanks for the $1.
[308:02.27]Just 100% in Spider-Man.
[308:07.86]Hope you're enjoying yourself as much as I did on the way through the campaign, because the story is, in my opinion, absolutely fantastic.
[308:16.97]Yeah, so far, so good.
[308:20.69]And here's the thing about this game.
[308:22.91]You want me to praise this game even more?
[308:27.23]It took not even two minutes when the game started.
[308:34.51]When I pressed start game,
[308:36.60]It was within less than two or three minutes.
[308:39.81]We were going.
[308:40.67]We were playing and it was really interesting.
[308:42.27]It was a really interesting experience.
[308:45.19]I applaud Insomniac for not going the route of, hey, why don't you deal with like an hour and 45 fucking minutes of cut scenes and maybe eight minutes of gameplay and then, okay, then the whole thing opens up for sure.
[309:03.32]I'm so glad they didn't go that route.
[309:05.72]Seriously.
[309:07.14]Thank you.
[309:08.90]Thank you for being a AAA game that doesn't want to do three hours of cutscenes before you get to play the game.
[309:18.35]No, I'm not even Metal Gear Solid.
[309:19.43]I'm talking just in general.
[309:20.45]That's been a trend for some reason.
[309:21.85]And I know a lot of people like it, but I don't.
[309:29.38]The storytelling AAA releases that are like that.
[309:34.01]This could have been one of them, and they chose not to do that, so that's good.
[309:41.70]Even the first level here, that first against Kingpin, that was hard.
[309:46.02]It was challenging.
[309:46.82]It made you learn.
[309:47.84]It made you immediately get into the game.
[309:49.66]You have to figure it out, otherwise you're not going to beat the tutorial.
[309:51.90]It was good.
[310:00.29]Great job.
[310:02.23]That's pretty much what we're saying here.
[310:04.97]It wasn't hard.
[310:05.69]You're just bad.
[310:06.59]No, but it's not that the level was hard.
[310:09.21]It was just you needed to know what... You needed to learn the moves.
[310:13.06]You couldn't just snooze through four hours of cutscenes.
[310:16.48]I had to learn how to play the game right there.
[310:19.22]Otherwise, I may as well have just turned off the console.
[310:24.40]I like that a lot.
[310:28.95]But, yeah.
[310:30.69]GK, it's a great game so far.
[310:38.68]Future Gamer, thanks for the two bucks.
[310:40.88]New day, new video.
[310:43.34]Hey, jermaHeart, love you, Jerma.
[310:44.79]Hey, thanks, man.
[310:45.53]Let's see, what is it?
[310:50.81]Hold on.
[310:56.93]I gotta plug this in.
[310:59.19]I missed a sub.
[311:02.85]Gustavi, thanks for the sub, dude.
[311:04.41]I missed it.
[311:06.61]Thanks for subbing.
[311:08.68]But this is like a 20-second video.
[311:11.31]Let's just go ahead and watch it.
[311:23.29]Here it is.
[311:25.76]Three minutes of peak time.
[311:34.92]What are you doing up there?
[311:36.36]Staying away from you.
[311:38.57]Don't go on the top rope!
[311:39.91]Don't go on the top rope!
[311:41.57]No, I can't take it!
[311:43.07]I can't do it!
[311:46.95]Oh, my fucking God.
[311:48.21]You guys come up with... I don't know where you're getting these clips for these videos.
[311:59.62]Where are you getting... Did you, like, rip the Spider-Man DVD?
[312:02.82]I don't understand.
[312:05.42]That was fucking awesome.
[312:06.18]Thanks, man.
[312:14.70]Give me the link.
[312:15.20]Give me the link.
[312:15.64]Here's the link.
[312:21.94]Alright.
[312:22.18]Let's keep going.
[312:23.65]Thank you, Future Gamer, for the two bucks and that clip.
[312:26.95]Snus, thanks for the $10.
[312:28.61]Or Snooze says, you're the best.
[312:32.49]Thank you for the $10, Snooze.
[312:35.83]And thank you for the kind words.
[312:37.30]Appreciate it.
[312:39.14]Dog Memes, thanks for the $1.
[312:40.72]Good stream.
[312:41.88]Thanks.
[312:43.28]Thanks.
[312:44.60]Thank.
[312:48.29]Thanks back to you.
[312:49.07]Thank you, man.
[312:50.83]ProSif, ProStar, thanks for the $1.
[312:52.35]Why don't you look at me during... Dermal... What?
[312:57.49]Dermal Pluto?
[312:58.17]What's going on here?
[312:59.49]Hey, KillCode, thanks again for the $50.
[313:04.92]Thank you so much, dude, if you're still here.
[313:12.13]I don't know what he was trying to say.
[313:13.97]What were you saying, ProStar?
[313:19.65]Hey, Game Watcher, thanks for the $4.
[313:21.55]You could have used this game for your yearly doctor checkup.
[313:27.97]Yeah, we talked about that last stream.
[313:32.05]At some point, that joke is just, like, just mean.
[313:38.60]Hey, look, it's Spider-Man again.
[313:41.36]Weren't you waiting for something?
[313:42.91]No, I can't.
[313:45.25]I can't do that.
[313:56.61]We've talked about the channel.
[314:00.62]Over the next six months or so, hopefully you'll see the combination of the two mediums.
[314:09.08]And we'll see if it was worth it.
[314:10.96]We'll see.
[314:18.56]I think you baked me home for the $1 Avengers Spidey or Tobey Maguire.
[314:22.12]I think they both have their qualities.
[314:30.86]I mean, the Avengers, I think, I don't know.
[314:33.53]That's hard.
[314:34.61]I said Tobey Maguire last night.
[314:35.89]I don't know.
[314:39.33]It's a tough call.
[314:44.33]Hey, Garfield, the Monday killer.
[314:45.51]Jerma, did you know... Thanks for the $1, by the way.
[314:48.25]Jerma, did you know that almost every town in Japan has its very own mascot?
[314:53.00]I did not know that.
[314:55.78]In the Discord, Garf's been given all the Germamites their own Japanese mascot to call their own.
[315:00.12]Unfortunately, Holy Mac's mascot wound up being a normal human.
[315:05.15]He's too honorable to rewind.
[315:06.51]Tell him it's never too late to get a new weird mascot thing.
[315:10.51]Also, we didn't give you a mascot.
[315:13.09]I need a mascot.
[315:15.38]Pick a number between 1 and 3,984.
[315:16.74]That was 4,000, okay.
[315:24.16]Two.
[315:26.92]Somebody do that already?
[315:33.12]I wonder what it is.
[315:36.97]I look forward to finding out what it was.
[315:38.73]Thank you, Garfield.
[315:40.39]Hey, Effectator, thanks for the $5.
[315:42.83]What's up, Effectator?
[315:43.61]Thank you so much, Jerma, for all the great content and the opportunity to work with you and Mac.
[315:48.22]Today is the second anniversary of the second channel, so I made a very special video for you.
[315:53.42]Godly wizard.
[315:57.68]Now, let's watch this.
[316:02.04]This is the second anniversary of the Jerma, second Jerma channel.
[316:12.57]Godly Wizard for $10.
[316:13.79]You're an amazing dude, Jerma.
[316:14.83]I've been watching your content for years and I wish you the best.
[316:18.02]Thank you, Godly.
[316:20.74]Thank you kindly.
[316:22.36]It's really weird to read out loud some of these things.
[316:25.72]I always feel like... This might sound odd.
[316:29.71]Maybe it doesn't.
[316:32.35]Me reading a sentence saying you're an amazing dude, Jerma.
[316:34.99]I wish you the best.
[316:35.73]You're so great.
[316:36.13]I always feel so odd.
[316:41.68]You know?
[316:42.93]Like, that, like, somebody actually, somebody thinks that of me.
[316:47.39]Like, some of you guys have said that.
[316:50.17]And it's like, it's so hard to react to that.
[316:54.13]Just because it's hard to put into words how I feel about... You guys, like, you guys are so fucking, such a huge part of my life, you know?
[317:04.52]You never have to feel obligated to give me money.
[317:06.16]Just hang out and fucking enjoy the stream.
[317:07.95]That's all I want.
[317:08.57]That's all I care about.
[317:09.43]The fact that you would even want to do that...
[317:12.41]is an incredibly humbling thing.
[317:14.53]The fact that you even would consider doing that is just mind-boggling to me.
[317:20.32]I've never been able to get used to that.
[317:22.77]And, like, I feel so fucking awful.
[317:24.85]Let me talk about this for a second.
[317:26.13]Seriously.
[317:27.17]Seriously.
[317:28.06]Like, I want these streams to be good, and I want them to be worth fucking you paying for them like that.
[317:32.32]I really don't deserve that $100.
[317:33.60]Because, like, the stream so far for, like, the last two hours has been fucking terrible.
[317:37.90]I always feel so awful when, like, a stream sucks.
[317:41.28]Sam gave $5.
[317:42.16]You're too hard on yourself.
[317:43.46]You might think you don't deserve the bits, but we all certainly do.
[317:46.90]Yeah.
[317:47.84]And I...
[317:50.29]all I look all I can do sucks all I can do is try to do the best I can that's all I can do that's all I've ever tried to do that's all I've ever wanted to do streaming video is like it's all I ever wanted to do that's all I ever tried to do nothing else I do I do get a little like hard on myself and that's because
[318:11.44]I want shit to be good.
[318:12.80]Here's what I care about.
[318:13.58]Ready?
[318:14.16]Here's the box that I want to check.
[318:16.04]And this is it.
[318:16.58]This is the only fucking box.
[318:18.38]Are you having a good time?
[318:21.38]Did you say no?
[318:22.78]Because if you did, then I'm doing something wrong and I need to do better.
[318:26.99]Look, I'm just a guy.
[318:28.79]I'm just a guy and all I know is as long as you're happy, then I'm happy.
[318:35.18]Jerma, I think I speak for all of us.
[318:36.20]We love you.
[318:37.20]You have done something.
[318:37.98]You've brought happiness and joy.
[318:39.27]Well, thank you so much, dude.
[318:41.05]Jerma, I will forever love you and your content.
[318:42.89]You can always count on you to make me laugh at any hour.
[318:45.29]Always looking forward to new streams and videos.
[318:46.71]Stay beautiful.
[318:47.07]Jerma, you've given me so many laughs over the years.
[318:48.63]You're worth every damn bit donated.
[318:49.97]I can't believe it's only been three months.
[318:51.11]Your stream is amazing.
[318:51.83]I can't say enough.
[318:52.41]Well, Spencer, thanks, man.
[318:53.25]I love you.
[318:53.67]Never forget that.
[318:54.91]I love you too, dude.
[318:55.54]I got a new job.
[318:56.52]I hope your job's going fucking fantastic.
[318:57.76]You've been here for, like, the last seven fucking almost years.
[319:00.20]Hopefully you're a new job.
[319:00.96]Hopefully you love your new job, dude.
[319:02.20]Seriously.
[319:02.80]I wish you the best.
[319:03.42]Had a rather atrocious weekend.
[319:05.02]This is bringing back some awesome memories.
[319:06.87]Thank you.
[319:07.45]Three years ago, me and my friends had been huge fans even beforehand.
[319:12.55]I love you.
[319:13.15]Here's my proof.
[319:13.85]I've kept it for years.
[319:16.01]Oh, this is the background.
[319:18.24]That's fucking amazing.
[319:19.74]Are you serious, man?
[319:20.92]That's fucking amazing.
[319:21.86]Thank you.
[319:23.28]That's incredibly touching.
[319:24.46]That is like touching me in the heart right now.
[319:26.90]The fact that there's 2,700 people here right now watching this is going to make me incredibly happy.
[319:32.02]You're all fucking awesome.
[319:33.64]I was really depressed and it made my days a little brighter.
[319:35.98]You guys are really awesome.
[319:41.21]We all get a big.
[319:44.87]Thank you.
[319:45.31]You know you know you know say when I wish there was another way for me to say Thanks, go ahead and go like this.
[319:49.37]Thank you, though.

[320:20.00]There it is.
[320:21.78]Well, thank you for that, man.
[320:26.91]Some of those clips are at least six, seven, eight months a year.
[320:31.01]You guys have heard me say that same shit.
[320:33.99]That...
[320:35.79]That song and dance ain't ever going to change.
[320:37.45]You understand?
[320:40.55]I'm not going to change that.
[320:50.82]I'm more than happy every time when I see that somebody is enjoying themselves here.
[320:57.37]Right?
[321:03.83]Here you go.
[321:05.83]Here is the link to that video.
[321:08.22]Hey, Vectator, thank you so much for that.
[321:09.50]I'm hanging out the window and you hear all these quotes in the background.
[321:26.03]All I can tell you is stay tuned and I hope you like the things that come out soon.
[321:33.97]Thank you so much, dude.
[321:36.48]Here's to another year on the second channel.
[321:42.96]Moving on, we're going to talk to, hey, Paul Nareff for the $4.
[321:46.80]Thanks a lot, man.
[321:48.72]jermaFear, jermaMars, Jerma Defoe, Metal Gear Solid 6, MJ Adventures.
[322:01.86]Wait, what are you talking about?
[322:03.27]What are you guys saying in this channel right now?
[322:06.37]There's a first channel?
[322:07.32]Yeah.
[322:10.42]If you have no idea, you might not even know.
[322:13.12]Look, I've been streaming on Twitch for two and a half years now.
[322:17.70]We don't really talk that much about the YouTube channel.
[322:19.87]If you have no idea what I'm talking about, there are about a thousand videos that I've made over the last, well, before a year or two ago.
[322:29.89]There's about five to six years and about a thousand videos on youtube.com slash germa985.
[322:36.45]If you've never seen it, that's some of my favorite moments of my entire time on the internet is on that channel.
[322:50.22]Some of it is, I would tell you to skip over the JermaCraft series, Otto's Big Adventure series, every Call of Duty video.
[322:59.22]Uh, each video that has an episode in the title, a skip over those two.
[323:03.95]Uh, any video, uh, I'm trying to think of what else.
[323:07.97]Any, uh, any video that has a, a like kill death ratio in the title, don't watch it.
[323:13.57]Just don't, just skip it.
[323:14.47]No reason to watch it.
[323:22.54]Why would you tell people to skip your best video?
[323:28.27]Skip the Enlightened videos too.
[323:29.99]You could skip those.
[323:31.91]That's what I was trying.
[323:33.97]The Enlightened phase was I was so desperately trying to be like a professional.
[323:40.32]Oh, let me tell you about these old classics.
[323:45.64]Yeah, you can skip those too.
[323:49.48]There's probably like 11 videos on the channel that are worth watching.
[323:52.50]Like the other 900, just skip them.
[323:57.20]No, I'm kidding.
[323:58.56]Every one of those videos I love.
[324:01.32]Except for the ones that I mentioned before.
[324:06.36]They're all worth watching.
[324:13.74]Watch just the Spider-Man videos.
[324:21.11]Need lore.
[324:24.81]Alright, let's keep going.
[324:25.97]We're almost done.
[324:29.53]Thank you to Kappa Poop for the $4.
[324:35.32]Are you just stuffing all those pigeons down your shirt?
[324:37.52]Your name is insane, by the way.
[324:39.06]Kappa Poop.
[324:45.64]Thank you, Kappa Poop.
[324:47.22]We had Big Bits come in.
[324:49.27]Holy shit, we did.
[324:54.19]Lorag gave $50 again.
[324:58.94]Lorag says you deserve the bits.
[325:01.96]$50.
[325:05.16]Thank you so much, man.
[325:10.31]You've contributed a shitload to this stream.
[325:14.03]As long as you've been here, man.
[325:14.87]Thank you so much.
[325:18.25]Really appreciate it.
[325:20.41]Eves also gave $50.
[325:21.19]5,000 bits from Eves as well.
[325:26.13]Here you go, Jeremy.
[325:26.95]Not gonna lie, that video made me fucking cry, but just wanted to also say give Kim and Otto a big hug when you get off stream tonight.
[325:34.59]Love you, Jeremy.
[325:36.79]Eve's Backwards is redacted.
[325:40.89]Well, I know what that is.
[325:42.83]Anybody else know what that is?
[325:43.73]Well, you could read it.
[325:46.49]Thank you so much, Eve's.
[325:52.13]I'm just happy that you continue to find this stream interesting.
[325:58.53]As long as I can keep that up.
[326:02.11]I'm gonna try.
[326:03.35]Thank you.
[326:08.87]Thanks to all of you while we're at it.
[326:14.07]And let's get back to where we were back here.
[326:17.33]It's time for slime.
[326:18.27]Thank you for the $20, 20 bucks from It's Time for Slime.
[326:23.45]Jeremiah, you have brought this upon yourself and it's a link, it's a video.
[326:29.26]Oh, my.
[326:29.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[326:33.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[326:35.87]No, no, no, no.
[326:36.93]Don't.
[326:39.65]Oh, my fucking God.
[326:40.85]I don't want... I'm not a gnome.
[326:47.09]I'm not a gnome.
[326:49.01]I'm a gnome.
[326:50.61]Right?
[327:01.83]I'm sorry, but it had to be done.
[327:04.17]No, I'm not giving the link for that one.
[327:06.19]You're gonna have to find that one.
[327:07.25]You're gonna have to search through.
[327:08.57]You're gonna have to find that one.
[327:09.53]I'm gonna make it harder for you.
[327:18.60]Can I permaban anyone who does that as a meme?
[327:25.42]I can't believe you did that that quickly.
[327:29.40]You made that so fast.
[327:35.04]People are gonna put that in places.
[327:38.04]I'm gonna get gnomed by myself... down the road here in the future.
[327:46.04]Oh my god... thank you time for slime for the twenty dollars and for that- that video... that shall not be named.
[328:01.55]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[328:03.15]This game looks downright beautiful.
[328:04.91]I really wish I could play it, but it looks like it's a PlayStation exclusive.
[328:09.04]Which means I'm gonna be left out.
[328:11.00]This game giving me a lot of Sleeping Dogs vibes.
[328:16.84]Uh... PlayStation 4 is just... At this point... Oh my god, it's not even a contest.
[328:30.58]This console is worth buying just to play the three or four exclusives that have come out for it that are nearly immaculate video games.
[328:44.33]Just to tell you about Xbox, I'm moving, right?
[328:49.83]You all know that.
[328:53.03]I'm giving that Xbox to somebody for free.
[328:56.79]I'm giving it away.
[329:07.25]I don't even know what to do with it.
[329:08.25]I thought about it, I was like oh I need to pack up some of my consoles I got like the switch I have my PS4 I- am I going to bring these?
[329:14.00]Hold on a minute... um yeah the Switch of course the Switch is going to probably have some new stuff coming out and it's the Switch or why it's I can- I can- I can play Binding of Isaac on the toilet that's enough to own it.
[329:24.00]Um... PlayStation 4 - all these exclusives: Spider-Man, Bloodborne, God of War. That's like okaym I have to bring it. I have to have it.
[329:34.00]Xbox One... um... what it got? Bad UI.
[329:43.00]Oh, that's it. Um, I don't think- I don't think I'm gonna bring it.
[329:50.00]What's it- what does it have?
[329:57.00]Xbox One, it has Halo. But Halo... I don't play Halo.
[330:04.55]Cuphead, I have on PC.
[330:06.06]I can play that on Steam.
[330:14.38]What's a Halo?
[330:19.02]Excuse me, do you own this game?
[330:25.56]Microsoft really needs to do something and has to bring in some really good devs to make a couple of exclusives.
[330:34.65]People are just forgetting that the console exists at this point.
[330:46.32]The backwards compatibility is awesome, but I don't know if that can save a current gen console.
[330:55.46]Hey, buy this brand new console so you can play games that you could play on the other one that you owned seven years ago.
[331:05.39]I want new stuff.
[331:06.89]I bought a new console for the new things.
[331:08.53]I didn't buy the new console for the old things.
[331:10.19]The old things is a bonus.
[331:22.25]But, yeah.
[331:24.55]I'll play mine for Forza Horizon 4, but that's about it.
[331:32.90]And the Windows 10 stuff, you can just play them on.
[331:34.79]Yeah, that's another thing.
[331:42.03]Gears of War is still a good exclusive.
[331:43.47]What was the last Gears of War game that came out that had actual critical and consumer acclaim?
[331:53.48]It was a long time ago, wasn't it?
[331:55.10]How long ago was that?
[332:02.15]4 was pretty good.
[332:02.85]4 was OK.
[332:03.65]3 was pretty good.
[332:10.01]4.
[332:10.07]Was 4 on the Xbox One?
[332:11.18]Or was that on Xbox 360?
[332:12.38]I don't even remember.
[332:22.66]It was on Xbox One and PC.
[332:26.36]Hm.
[332:29.28]I honestly, I really hope they do like kind of get their act together because the competition just breeds ingenuity.
[332:41.38]And it can't just be, you know, it was always like Microsoft versus PlayStation, Microsoft versus Sony.
[332:48.56]Nintendo is in its own world.
[332:50.46]They're not even in the same category.
[332:52.18]They're in a different planet.
[333:02.50]But that means I have to choose.
[333:03.68]It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next five years with the consoles.
[333:12.21]Who comes out with the next big one?
[333:13.69]And what's the big games that come out?
[333:15.97]Who's going to get the next one?
[333:17.34]Who's going to take the next console a step further?
[333:19.64]Who knows?
[333:29.24]Yeah, Microsoft makes the money either way.
[333:32.47]The exclusives come out on Windows.
[333:34.43]Microsoft is, yeah, no, that's true.
[333:35.97]That's a good point.
[333:44.70]But still, I'd like to see them have a little bit more on the, hey, look, it's an Xbox One game, and you check it out.
[333:54.00]Isn't that cool?
[333:55.08]It's a great game.
[333:57.25]You want it.
[333:59.43]Because even the ones that were exclusive...
[334:02.88]Cuphead's the only one I can think of that I actually wanted to purchase.
[334:08.94]Like, Sea of Thieves?
[334:10.08]Was Sea of Thieves even any good?
[334:13.72]Sea of Thieves was... Nobody talks about it anymore.
[334:16.10]It's just like, the game came out, and then... Oh, it was kind of fun, and then, what's it?
[334:19.42]It's over.
[334:21.70]It was like, they just released.
[334:24.12]The game was... Okay.
[334:25.80]Okay.
[334:28.43]Sea of Thieves is not good.
[334:29.53]No, it's garbage.
[334:30.87]But that's what I'm saying, right?
[334:34.07]If we could all collectively go, Sea of Thieves, holy shit, that game is fantastic, then I obviously would not have a leg to stand on with the things I'm saying, and neither would everybody else that has these criticisms for Microsoft.
[335:00.19]I'm just salty about I bought an Xbox One.
[335:02.85]Well, that's what I mean.
[335:03.53]That's why as a consumer, you also should be treated with the same respect that the other console buyers are.
[335:15.53]It always sucks when a new console comes out and you kind of flip the coin because let's just face it, right?
[335:24.24]Xbox One and PS4, the same shit comes out for both of them.
[335:27.87]The exact same games come out for both consoles.
[335:30.57]Every AAA release comes out on both.
[335:33.45]So it just kind of, which one is going to have the better exclusive games?
[335:36.97]And sometimes you pick completely wrong.
[335:44.90]And for the last three or four years, PlayStation 4 has just absolutely killed it with their exclusives.
[335:52.16]Absolutely destroyed it.
[336:02.29]We could talk until we're blue in the face about this.
[336:08.33]Give your Xbox to Grandpa.
[336:14.14]The Switch and the PS4 are just great right now.
[336:19.62]Yeah, I really hate to say and doggone Microsoft and shit, but I want them to have cool stuff.
[336:28.52]I want to have a reason to be like, man, yeah, Xbox One, let me turn that shit on.
[336:35.02]That hasn't been the case.
[336:36.94]But we're going to move on.
[336:37.86]We could talk about that for hours.
[336:43.62]But Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1, and sorry that you can't play it.
[336:49.14]It's very good.
[336:51.25]Coconut Lips, thanks for the $1.
[336:52.85]No message, just Jeremy Jupiter.
[336:56.79]Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $1 sticks.
[336:58.87]Half the people in this costume party are just furries.
[337:01.57]Yeah, that was true.
[337:04.87]I mean, it wasn't true.
[337:05.84]Halloween doesn't count.
[337:06.60]Halloween doesn't count?
[337:07.24]What are you talking about?
[337:08.42]Wait a minute.
[337:09.72]Halloween doesn't count?
[337:13.62]Everybody gets a free pass on Halloween to dress up as anything crazy.
[337:17.24]That's what they say.
[337:18.97]I worded that incorrectly.
[337:23.51]I'm not, I did not, I'm trying not to say that worded that wrong.
[337:30.05]I'm saying just in general.
[337:33.75]No, no, no, no, no, it doesn't.
[337:39.50]It's a furry excuse.
[337:40.96]No, it's not, listen.
[337:43.40]On Halloween, every adult is allowed to dress up as whatever the fuck they want.
[337:47.70]As long as it's in good taste, right?
[337:53.74]If I want to dress up as Reptar for Halloween, and it's in good taste, then I'm, that's fine.
[338:00.60]I'm, I don't think, I don't, I'm not a dinosaur.
[338:02.98]I'm not a, uh, a dino, dino-ree.
[338:06.04]I'm not a dino-rea, right?
[338:10.98]If I dress up as a dinosaur outside of Halloween, then maybe I would be a dino-rea, you know what I mean?
[338:17.00]But not on Halloween.
[338:27.95]But thank you, Stix.
[338:28.63]Thank you, Lazy Look, for the $1.
[338:30.97]I got it right this time.
[338:33.81]CF likes cake.
[338:35.55]Thanks for the $1 here.
[338:36.55]Listen for the piss, and you too will hear the truth.
[338:46.92]Don't attack the furries.
[338:48.06]That's 70% of your fan base.
[338:50.68]I'm trying to clarify that I'm not doing that.
[338:56.83]70%.
[338:57.19]I think that's a little generous.
[338:58.85]I don't think it's 70%.
[338:59.45]What do you mean true?
[339:04.81]I don't care what percentage it is.
[339:12.38]It could be 100 and I wouldn't care.
[339:14.10]No, I'm not doing a poll.
[339:27.14]A poll that everybody can just lie on.
[339:28.86]No, I don't need to see it.
[339:31.55]It's definitely 90.
[339:32.61]No, I'm not doing the poll.
[339:34.31]No, don't... Fine.
[339:37.97]Go ahead.
[340:11.89]51, 52%, yep.
[340:14.91]Am I?
[340:16.63]Am I?
[340:17.27]Are you?
[340:18.61]Am I what?
[340:19.19]I don't need to say it.
[340:20.05]You know, what's the conversation we're just having?
[340:22.39]I don't need to say it.
[340:30.90]You dug your own grave.
[340:35.42]Alright, well, so 54% are, okay?
[340:36.16]That's fine.
[340:58.49]I wasn't, but then I watched Space Jam.
[341:02.22]Space Jam made you... Oh, my God.
[341:11.34]Well, there you go.
[341:11.94]There you have it.
[341:14.74]Thank you, by the way.
[341:15.44]Let's move on.
[341:18.88]Thank you to... Gorgon for the $4.
[341:25.08]No message.
[341:25.52]Thank you, Gorgon.
[341:26.76]Mr. Fancy, thanks for the $4.
[341:28.17]Hey, Jerma long-time viewer, can you call my friend Jargon Scott a poot?
[341:33.99]It's a long-running in-joke, and I'd appreciate it.
[341:38.05]He's a poot.
[341:39.69]Jargon Scott is a poot.
[341:42.19]Hopefully, I just didn't say something horrible.
[341:47.72]But, yeah.
[341:49.20]Oh, poot is okay, I see.
[341:53.48]Kyrensky, thanks for the $1.
[341:55.56]Now that you're moving, are you still going to attend PAX East?
[341:59.01]Me and my friend have always wanted to meet you, and that's the closest big con to us.
[342:04.15]Unfortunately, the answer is no.
[342:07.05]I will not be coming back for PAX East.
[342:11.86]I will most likely now, because I'll be so close, I'll be going to E3.
[342:20.60]TwitchCon.
[342:22.22]Not this year, though.
[342:23.10]We're talking 2019.
[342:24.02]I probably won't make it to very... I probably won't make it to very more conventions, in quotes.
[342:32.04]And, like, maybe the big ones.
[342:33.53]Ow, someone just bit me.
[342:35.37]No, that was my... That was me.
[342:36.85]Okay, never mind.
[342:39.35]I'm fine.
[342:40.77]It would be... E3.
[342:43.27]I'll probably go to E3.
[342:45.10]Just because.
[342:46.22]Why not?
[342:46.74]Especially this next year, apparently.
[342:48.26]It's probably going to be a big one.
[342:53.48]Spider-Man.
[343:02.32]But thank you for your question.
[343:03.29]Unfortunately, I will not be going to PAX East.
[343:08.27]Hey, CF likes cake.
[343:09.69]Thanks for the $1.
[343:10.43]You got this, Jerma.
[343:11.25]Keep trying.
[343:11.87]I hope I did it.
[343:14.99]Hey, Chase.
[343:15.65]Thank you, Chase.
[343:16.21]SP1 for the $1.
[343:17.31]Jerma, I will donate 5,000 bits if you do an attempt of this live on a 20-foot drop.
[343:26.84]No, $50 is not worth me having like $16,000 in reconstructive leg and knee, shin and foot surgery.
[343:37.77]So I don't think I'll do that.
[343:43.65]Thank you though.
[343:44.91]Coward, okay.
[343:46.65]I'm a coward.
[343:55.71]He said MJ could do it.
[343:56.78]That wasn't a 20-foot drop.
[343:58.20]That was like 12 feet, maybe.
[344:00.38]Not even.
[344:02.18]And that was into grass.
[344:06.14]CF likes cake.
[344:07.44]Thanks for the two bucks.
[344:09.38]Jokes aside, great work as usual, Jerma.
[344:11.10]Been here since TF2.
[344:13.26]And your excellency made content, excellently made content, never ceases to be hilarious and amazing.
[344:18.99]Thank you for everything, man.
[344:22.27]Thank you, CF.
[344:25.57]Really appreciate that.
[344:26.27]Thank you so much.
[344:28.87]And thank you for the $2.

[345:02.54]It's through that.
[345:05.77]Through working together a long time ago.
[345:07.89]Like 10, 12 years ago.
[345:13.11]We did it using words.

[346:46.43]SheXOXO, thanks for the $1.
[346:48.21]I can't believe you just gnomed me.

[346:50.35]I didn't.
[346:50.89]I got gnomed.
[346:52.85]With me making fun of the gnome meme.
[346:56.35]So me say, I did the worst thing you could do online on a live stream.
[346:59.89]I said the thing out loud.
[347:02.35]Right?
[347:04.71]That was my wrongdoing.
[347:06.03]I'm sorry about that.
[347:10.52]Hazy42, thanks for the $5, Hazy.
[347:13.40]When you lay in bed at night wondering if people find you funny, I just want you to know that I think you are funny.
[347:21.13]You know, I do that from time to time.
[347:22.97]I do.
[347:24.83]I lie there.
[347:25.39]I'll be like, was that good?
[347:27.42]Was that stream any good?
[347:30.80]And then I fucking meticulously go and look at the comments and scroll through.
[347:34.22]What did every single person say about this stream?
[347:37.27]What did that person say?
[347:37.77]That person said they didn't like it.
[347:39.01]Why did they say that?
[347:55.44]Thank you, though, Hazy.
[347:56.34]Appreciate it.
[347:58.02]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[348:00.50]Your gladiator in the ring of mascots is Barry-san.
[348:07.47]Barry took home silver medal in the first mascot fight and is in the first place champ the 2012 mascot fight.
[348:16.33]He even has lore.
[348:18.07]He wears a bridge on his head, always goes around wearing a bath towel, much like your bathrobe.
[348:24.38]The things he loves most in life is sleeping, eating, and his little dog.
[348:28.04]And here's a link to his dog.
[348:31.86]Here's the man himself.
[348:38.43]That's pretty accurate.
[348:42.07]Yeah, I can see this being me.
[348:48.51]Yeah, I'll show you.
[348:50.31]Minus rep bad treasure.
[348:54.05]Hey, hey, just take a look.
[348:57.21]Just put it on screen.
[348:59.67]This is my fursona, apparently.
[349:01.57]Whatever it's called.
[349:02.49]What was this again?
[349:03.03]What's this for?
[349:11.91]Barry-san.
[349:17.02]Oh, it's my Japanese mascot gladiator.
[349:20.82]Well, I'm dead.
[349:24.53]How am I going to fight anybody?
[349:27.71]There are a hundred points on this fat stomach for you to stick a knife through.
[349:31.24]How am I going to hurt you?
[349:34.90]Do I have supersonic sound waves that come out of my mouth?
[349:45.55]He already won.
[349:46.17]I already won.
[349:46.77]I did it.
[349:50.11]I won.
[349:53.43]Well, anyways, thank you, Garfield.
[349:54.89]I'm glad I took home the silver medal.
[349:59.27]Hey, Clueless, thanks for the $1.
[350:00.31]Hey, Jerma, did you know somebody made a comic about the guy who donates bits to you every stream?
[350:05.27]It's pretty cool.
[350:06.83]He just links Garfield.com.
[350:12.43]God damn it.
[350:13.81]Thank you, VRJosh, for the $5.
[350:15.95]Jerma, that appreciation video earlier reminded me how much I've appreciated your content over the years.
[350:21.84]Uh, here's another video showcasing how great you've been.
[350:29.80]I can't fucking believe it already happened.
[350:33.98]And I can't, I don't, I, oh my god.
[350:39.69]Why did I do that?
[350:40.65]Why would I put myself in that position?
[350:42.89]Why would I even remotely have made the gnome noise
[350:48.75]Now people are going to think that I'm just like jumping on a fucking meme bandwagon.
[350:52.79]And people are going to hear that and be like, oh, he's just like trying to get, he's trying to jump on the bandwagon with that one.
[350:59.88]God damn it.
[351:10.48]No one thinks that.
[351:11.34]Oh, you guys don't think that.
[351:13.79]But your friend David's going to see it and be like, oh, that guy's a fucking loser.
[351:23.62]They wouldn't be wrong.
[351:25.46]No, they wouldn't.
[351:30.05]It was too hard to resist.
[351:31.33]No, go for it.
[351:33.09]It's already out.
[351:35.69]Cat's out of the bag now.
[351:36.91]The snake's out of the box.
[351:38.78]The snake's out of the peanut can.
[351:40.90]Do they still make those?
[351:45.48]They do, right?
[351:46.16]Like a prank store?
[351:49.24]Delete that.
[351:51.52]Somebody get me the Beyonce publicist that deleted her image.
[351:55.14]Remember that picture that was deleted?
[351:57.44]That she tried to get deleted from the internet?
[351:58.82]Can I hire that person to delete that from the internet?
[352:09.89]Thank you, VRJosh.
[352:12.61]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[352:13.83]Hey, Jerma, did you know the 19th anniversary of the release of the Dreamcast was Sunday?
[352:19.23]It's my favorite console of all time.
[352:21.21]And it's still just sitting back here.
[352:25.25]I still have PlayStation 2 games to play, guys.
[352:28.91]So there's a lot of stuff to do.
[352:32.40]Why is that?
[352:33.70]I forgot.
[352:34.44]Why is this on the screen still?
[352:36.10]What is this for?
[352:36.62]Is this like your favorite anime character?
[352:39.90]I forget what that even was.
[352:40.76]Whatever it was.
[352:41.50]Thanks for that.
[352:42.00]Appreciate it.

[353:21.83]You hear it?
[353:27.21]Yeah, I muted it.
[353:35.27]Am I gonna go to the mall later?
[353:38.79]Mall's closed.
[353:43.90]It's like 9.30, man, mall is closed.
[353:48.22]Well, thank you, Sticky Brick, for your pretty good attempt there.
[353:52.74]Hey, Rice, thanks for the $1.

[354:03.93]But thank you for the $2 here combined.
[354:09.29]Mall isn't closed.

[354:52.28]Oh, shit.
[354:54.02]I'm an idiot.
[354:54.92]I got it.
[354:59.54]But speaking of Hurricane, hopefully you guys are going to stay safe, those of you that are around that area.
[355:05.75]Take care of yourself.
[355:06.39]Be careful.
[355:13.51]Thank you, Maisykit, for the $1.
[355:16.40]I bought a ticket to TwitchCon last week.
[355:18.20]You're still planning on being there, right?
[355:20.54]I haven't been able to actively follow your stream for a while, so I don't know what you've been saying.
[355:26.27]I'm going to really severely disappoint you here, Maisie.
[355:32.21]TwitchCon is happening at a really bad point because of the move.
[355:40.96]I'm going to be so focused on getting settled into Las Vegas.
[355:46.07]That I can't really go to TwitchCon.
[355:49.89]If I were to go to TwitchCon, it would have to be like a day trip.
[355:54.84]Because... What's Las Vegas to... Where the fuck is TwitchCon this year?
[356:00.96]I don't even know.
[356:08.33]I don't know where TwitchCon even is.
[356:09.75]But it would have to be... It's in San Jose.
[356:11.75]Okay.
[356:14.63]Okay.
[356:15.15]San Jose.
[356:15.73]I mean, it would have to be one of those scenarios where, I mean, Las Vegas to San Jose is probably not even an hour or two.
[356:22.31]I would have to just get on a plane and just go hang out outside the building as a weirdo.
[356:27.67]Just like, hey, do you have a ticket, sir?
[356:30.07]No.
[356:32.17]Are you a streamer?
[356:32.99]No.
[356:34.27]Are you sure?
[356:34.97]No, I'm not a streamer.
[356:35.81]I don't know what that is.
[356:37.36]I'd have to just kind of hang out outside.
[356:43.20]It's about two hours flight.
[356:45.56]I would have to just go get like coffee and just sit there and just be like in my Jerma985 2017 TwitchCon jersey.
[356:54.46]I kind of just like to watch.
[356:58.26]I know what that's from.
[357:01.00]I don't know what that is.
[357:06.95]But that would be a last minute decision.
[357:09.35]It depends on how settled that we all are in Las Vegas.
[357:17.84]But anyways, I don't know.
[357:20.15]Probably not, though.
[357:23.43]Rice-a-roni.
[357:23.99]Repeating from Rice-a-roni.
[357:26.03]Rice-a-roni says, hey, been a long time fan since I found you through Shibby's channel.
[357:31.43]That's old school there.
[357:33.20]You've always been able to make me laugh when I felt like shit as well as being one of the inspirations for my going to the gym in recent years.
[357:41.02]Thank you, Rice-a-roni.
[357:43.20]Sorry that your messages were getting screwed up, but...
[357:49.65]Um, I'm glad you're going to the gym, getting in shape.
[357:54.93]Shibby, I haven't seen Shibby in over just about a year.
[358:00.21]Hope he's doing well.
[358:03.66]Hit the bench.
[358:05.14]Hit the bench if you want to, and if you feel like you want to.
[358:07.92]You can do whatever you want, as long as you stay healthy.
[358:12.26]Uh, thank you Cro-Mag- Thank you Cro-Magnon.

[360:45.00]Luckily, I have some friends in San Jose that I was planning on visiting.
[360:48.75]Would you announce it if you were going to slum it out outside the building?
[360:54.29]Yes.
[360:55.75]I would make that very clear at least a few days in advance.
[360:58.94]By all means, yes.
[361:04.80]Why does Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse delete your money?
[361:07.41]Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse was awesome.
[361:13.48]But with that, I will see you guys all tomorrow.
[361:16.44]Probably around the same time.
