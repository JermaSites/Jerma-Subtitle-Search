[02:12.85]I'm not going to pretend like I'm... So other people were having that problem.
[02:18.82]It wasn't just me.
[02:25.44]I need to change this.
[02:28.76]Well...
[02:36.26]At least we are playing a game called Origins.
[02:43.18]You know?
[02:48.46]It is condemned.
[02:51.04]Criminal Origins.

[03:30.31]And we don't have to... There we go.
[03:31.17]Hold on.
[03:35.41]There we go.
[03:35.89]Okay.
[03:37.11]Uh, I can't wait till computers are at the point where they just, you just open up your shirt and this is just a screen here and you can just like fucking look down.
[03:45.72]When is that going to happen?
[03:47.71]I can't wait till that happens.
[03:50.65]I can't but you like you roll your sleeve up and bang there's your LCD and you sit there like this and like you got the controller in your hand and you're playing like the Assassin's Creed Origins 3 because they're gonna remake the origin story of Assassin's Creed another four times probably and you can sit there and just fucking like you got the switch controller and it's just like you got like analog A B analog ABC and then L R or like you go like this and you fork underneath you go like that
[04:19.85]Condemned runs really poorly on Nvidia graphics cards.
[04:22.41]Well, that's just fan-fucking-tastic to hear.
[04:25.14]Yeah.
[04:27.80]I know, and like, sooner or later, inside of our eyelids, at birth,
[04:33.21]There's gonna be a process where they, like, and, like, cartoon Roger Rabbit pull your eyelids out, and, like, you're gonna have, like, fucking heat, like, LEDs in your eyelids.
[04:45.51]So, when you close your eyes, and, like, you know, like, they slap, like, a balloon, they, and your eyes close, you'll be able to close your eyes and watch a goddamn movie on a plane.
[04:55.15]You're not gonna have to have an iPad.
[04:57.34]Just close your eyes.
[04:58.74]There it is.
[05:00.74]It's always sunny in Philadelphia my favorite TV show wait a minute X that out cancel that you just like click X on the top right screen Navigate navigate over to the left side.

[06:41.56]Where we play Assassin's Creed Origins for six minutes.
[06:45.88]And then... The curveball comes in and I have to swing and hit a... I gotta try to hit a home run on a... Look, I just went into the Major Leagues.
[06:53.37]I was in the stands.
[06:55.11]And going to watch the fucking baseball game was Assassin's Creed Origins.
[06:59.53]And over the Jumbotron, they point the camera at me.
[07:02.65]I got like fucking a hot dog.
[07:03.89]I have like fucking two popcorns and like three large drinks.
[07:07.82]And I'm just sitting there like... You know what I mean?
[07:09.28]Like...
[07:12.97]I got on the Jumbotron.
[07:13.97]I'm just like, what the fuck is happening?
[07:15.89]And they're like, you, Jerma985, come on down.
[07:19.00]It's time for you to be the next at bat.
[07:21.08]And I'm just like, I'm not ready for this.
[07:23.00]And like a bunch of security guards fucking grabbed me and like put my arms behind my back and like put cuffs on me.
[07:28.26]And like I'm being arrested and they bring me down to the box.
[07:31.00]And then they let the cuffs off, give me a bat.
[07:32.42]And they say, you got to hit a fucking home run right now.
[07:36.23]Huh?
[07:37.77]And I, bam, goes over the fucking left field fence.
[07:41.15]That's what I got to do tonight.
[07:44.31]No one buys two popcorns.
[07:45.49]Yes, they do.
[07:46.17]I do.
[07:47.35]Who doesn't buy two popcorns?
[07:48.11]Look at this fucking dumbass here.
[07:49.57]What a dumbass loser.
[07:53.63]Has everybody left yet?
[07:54.93]No, not quite.
[07:56.78]Alright, we got like two.
[07:58.38]What do we got?
[07:59.22]One minute?
[08:01.44]41 seconds and then I can open the game.
[08:02.70]Does condemned criminal Assassin's Creed Origins require a like community patch to work?
[08:13.63]Assassin's Creed Criminal Condemned Origins.
[08:15.74]Does it need a community patch to physically fucking function?
[08:24.64]No.
[08:26.56]No.
[08:26.90]It requires you play.
[08:32.45]When's the new emotes coming?
[08:33.99]Hopefully soon.
[08:35.44]I don't know.
[08:36.28]Who knows?
[08:36.96]I could be making that up.
[08:38.50]Hey, SmokewiseGonja, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[08:40.38]Don't you dare let game issues get you down.
[08:42.56]It's not your fault, and we love you also.
[08:44.14]Ubisoft sucks.
[08:46.68]It's alright, though.
[08:47.50]Like I told you, I'm gonna try to hit a goddamn grand slam.
[08:51.35]There's three guys.
[08:52.25]There's two outs.
[08:54.27]And they give me a 3-2 count.
[08:56.07]And the guy's gonna throw a curveball right down the middle.
[08:58.11]I'm gonna hit a grand slam, and I'm gonna bring them all home.
[09:01.67]Four runs.
[09:04.25]Speaking of baseball, didn't the Houston Astros just win the World Series?
[09:08.15]Ah, good for them.
[09:10.73]Red Sox have won it three damn times in the last decade and a half.
[09:14.87]Dynasty.
[09:15.93]They're a dynasty at this point, boys and girls.
[09:24.60]Actually, Houston beat the Red Sox, didn't they?
[09:26.58]Alright, let's try this.
[09:28.74]Let's open this.
[09:29.42]Give me a second.
[09:29.98]I'm sorry.
[09:31.48]We're going to have to go to the VR.
[09:33.16]No, we don't.
[09:34.90]This should work here.
[09:40.04]The Cubs won.
[09:40.67]Yeah, the Cubs did win.
[09:42.95]Let's try it.
[09:43.39]Hopefully the fucking stream doesn't turn off.
[09:54.77]That's a good title.
[09:57.26]Condemned, not Assassin's Creed.
[09:58.92]No, I can't do that.
[09:59.78]I'll probably get in trouble for that.
[10:11.17]I don't care.
[10:11.83]I'm doing it anyways.
[10:16.19]I just took a screenshot.
[10:18.59]It's taking screenshots over and over again.
[10:23.73]I actually think it's going to work.
[10:24.77]Let's see.
[10:26.15]Okay, I'm doing condemned not Assassin's Creed criminal origins.
[10:32.96]There we go.
[10:33.42]That's better.

[14:32.11]No!
[14:34.81]What happened?
[14:35.86]Why did this happen?
[14:38.10]Why is it 800 by 600 right now?
[14:40.98]Who told you to do that?
[14:45.58]Okay.
[14:47.60]Is this game capped at fucking 30 FPS?
[14:52.90]Am I missing something completely?
[14:57.32]Performance.
[14:57.98]Advanced.
[15:01.95]Medium world detail.
[15:03.97]Is there like a... Looked like it capped it at 32 FPS.
[15:14.98]Display.
[15:17.38]No.
[15:19.00]Maybe I should turn on VSync.
[15:21.32]Let's turn VSync on.
[15:24.33]Well, that made it way worse.
[15:30.28]Computer height.
[15:33.06]Okay, set the level of detail for CPU and RAM-related performance options.
[15:39.00]I don't fucking have any idea.
[15:43.39]One of these is probably doing it.
[15:47.03]We're gonna have to just go to... Just turn VSync off.
[15:52.52]It might just be... This game might just be Captain 30.
[15:56.04]Alright.
[15:56.46]Approach the police station.

[21:03.67]Flashback.
[21:09.15]He's eating this person.
[21:10.15]He was eating this person.
[21:12.48]No, it's just a honey-baked hand.
[21:14.36]No, it's a guy's head.
[21:15.12]No, that's just a honey-baked hand that's been carved to look like a guy's head.
[21:19.64]This person's innocent!
[21:22.44]Press ready tool.
[21:25.97]What the fuck is this?
[21:29.83]Bright green.
[21:32.11]Bright green.
[21:32.97]Looking for some evidence here with our sniper scope.
[21:36.57]Well, there's evidence.
[21:37.69]See?
[21:37.85]He was just a messy eater.
[21:44.02]All the white arrows are pointing inward.
[21:47.40]And then use back to focus until small triangles on display touch.
[21:57.13]Yeah, there it is.
[21:57.83]This actually is fairly difficult to control.
[22:04.63]I feel like I should plug a controller into this.
[22:06.33]This is really awkward controlling.
[22:08.90]Solved the case.
[22:26.42]This guy should have a Boston accent.
[22:30.30]They messed up here.
[22:33.26]Any news on the killer?
[22:34.74]Where'd he go?
[22:35.76]Fuck.
[22:39.69]Pull up the tool again?
[22:44.03]Oh, wait.
[22:44.61]I gotta follow Officer fucking... I gotta follow Officer fucking... Officer fucking O'Reilly.
[22:52.64]This guy's so dead.
[22:53.72]He's going to get hit with an arrow through the skull.
[22:56.81]It's going to go... Dang it.
[22:59.25]I can smell the cigarette smoke.
[23:01.77]Watch it.
[23:02.09]Arrow.
[23:11.03]Who's out there?
[23:11.75]Should I take out my camcorder?
[23:18.92]Nope.
[23:19.18]Here it is.
[23:23.27]Call for backup now.
[23:25.07]This is Officer Becker.
[23:26.15]We need backup immediately.
[23:27.77]Here's my first gun.
[23:28.97]His head's gonna explode.
[23:35.24]Copy that.
[23:36.54]Becker and I will head up the fire escape.
[23:38.42]You wait here for backup.
[23:39.68]Oh no, I have to wait here?
[23:42.64]Shit.
[23:43.84]Okay, now he's playing with us.
[23:46.02]Change of plans.
[23:47.06]Becker, secure that door.
[23:48.44]Thomas, check out the building and get these lights back on.
[23:51.49]I have to turn the lights on.
[23:52.47]Alright.
[23:53.45]I love how they changed the plan immediately.
[23:54.95]Now I have to leave.
[23:56.25]I was supposed to stay.
[23:57.01]Now they have to stay.
[23:58.05]There's one room.
[24:08.46]That's bad investigation work.
[24:09.54]Yeah, I kicked the door open.
[24:15.77]There's a bunch of shit everywhere.
[24:16.91]There's 13 more rooms.
[24:19.76]It's clear.
[24:20.74]I'm not even going to look at the box.
[24:25.44]Good luck.
[24:31.35]Hello?
[24:31.61]Hello?
[24:41.28]amped up.
[24:42.02]Oh my god, there he is.
[24:44.32]Is there an aim down sights?
[24:45.10]I don't think there is.
[24:47.52]Oh boy.
[24:48.30]I got a control scheme.
[24:50.96]Can we please?
[24:52.69]Controls.
[24:54.77]Mouse.
[24:56.89]Mouse sensitivity.
[24:58.21]Mouse smoothing.
[24:59.29]Oh, fuck me.
[25:00.09]Okay.
[25:06.73]Okay.
[25:09.77]Ooh, that's so bad.
[25:11.57]That's not even funny.
[25:14.24]Wait, keyboard.
[25:14.72]Here we go.
[25:17.98]I cannot escape.
[25:18.78]There's nothing.
[25:19.72]Kick is space.
[25:21.86]Ram, slap, snap, punch.
[25:25.06]Why is this the best game ever made?
[25:29.59]What?
[25:31.45]Are these like alcoholic beverages or am I gonna punch people with this shit?
[25:37.35]No, this is just the Rice Krispies.
[25:39.85]Except they added a character.
[25:43.19]Yeah, snap, crackle, punch, ram, kick.
[25:49.71]Mouse, we gotta... Mouse... As much as I don't want to do this... Oh well.
[25:56.45]We're gonna have to deal with it.
[25:59.30]Press mouse button zero to fire a gun.
[26:01.08]This is Trevor from GTA.
[26:10.94]Fuck you.
[26:13.80]Addicts.
[26:14.60]Vagrants.
[26:22.12]Oh, no.
[26:22.84]This is where Trevor's GTA storyline ends.
[26:26.81]Is this canon?
[26:30.95]What's that?
[26:33.65]Can I interact with this?
[26:37.43]Uh, no.
[26:38.79]Is there a sprint?
[26:40.75]I don't think there's a sprint.
[26:45.46]Is that guy alive?
[26:48.72]He's a... Alright, I wanted to make... I wanted to make sure that guy was not gonna... Okay.
[26:57.30]There's a fistful of frag.
[26:58.24]That guy, I had to make sure that wasn't gonna happen.
[27:00.05]I turned him into a fucking marionette, but it's alright.
[27:06.69]I love the Fistful of Frags kick.
[27:10.41]Health kit.
[27:10.83]Open door.
[27:15.19]Use health kit.
[27:15.77]I don't need to.
[27:18.77]I am the killer.
[27:19.65]These guys are fucking terrifying.
[27:22.80]Should I pull out investigation stuff?
[27:24.36]I can't.
[27:26.58]I guess you only do Batman mode when the Batman detective mode actually becomes a thing you need to do.
[27:36.32]Alright, check ammo.
[27:38.52]Full.
[27:39.24]Seven.
[27:41.72]You are limited to ammo found in weapons used wisely.
[27:44.72]Alright, so I should probably start, like, kicking people then.
[27:48.64]With my, like, munchkin shoe.
[27:51.36]This guy's got, like, a size three.
[27:57.69]And I'm talking size three US.
[28:01.85]That won't open.
[28:04.81]Yeah.
[28:07.99]No.
[28:08.57]Kick this down?
[28:09.37]No.
[28:13.69]Is there a sprint?
[28:14.17]Maybe there isn't a sprint.
[28:15.31]You know, I'm glad.
[28:16.25]I'm glad.
[28:16.93]Finally, a game decided not to put a sprint.
[28:20.47]Because you need to... It's scarier and more deliberate and more intimate that way.
[28:26.13]It makes the game way more intimate.
[28:30.19]How's the audio, too?
[28:30.91]Is the audio good?
[28:32.23]Should I turn it up a little?
[28:33.25]Let's turn it up a tad.
[28:35.56]Let's go, like, one, two, three.
[28:38.83]That's probably a little better.
[28:41.45]Yeah, that's better.
[28:46.47]Nothing.
[28:47.83]No Batman detective yet.
[28:52.38]Can I put on items?
[28:54.98]No, I can't.
[28:59.20]Oh, I hear something.
[29:00.22]Okay.
[29:00.90]Just Oscar the Grouch fell out of his can.
[29:05.69]What the fuck?
[29:08.51]Oh, God.
[29:11.87]Oh, Oscar.
[29:14.23]Oscar!
[29:15.55]Alright, let's see if I can kick this guy.
[29:17.07]Ow, that fucking hurts.
[29:21.05]Oh, yeah.
[29:21.75]Kim just brought me fruit roll-ups.
[29:25.42]Let's try one.
[29:28.88]Mmm!
[29:30.72]Pretty good fruit roll-up!
[29:34.26]Thank you.
[29:34.56]Alright, love you.
[29:36.14]Oh, pretty good fruit roll-ups.
[29:40.62]No, it's actually bologna and cheese with a pickle in the middle.
[29:42.75]It's fucking pretty good.
[29:49.29]Alright, so... Where's my health?
[29:52.41]Top left?
[29:57.17]What should I be doing?
[29:58.23]Oh, there is a sprint.
[29:59.19]This game's dumb now.
[29:59.97]I don't even like it anymore.
[30:01.64]You gave me a sprint.
[30:05.82]What am I doing?
[30:06.62]This is not Call of Duty.
[30:10.56]He's going to come right around the corner.
[30:19.44]I'm waiting for it.
[30:23.87]He's like scrounging around in here somewhere.
[30:33.83]No, we're going over here.
[30:44.57]Oh, in this way.
[30:48.90]A streamer ignores girlfriend.
[30:50.72]What are you talking about?
[30:53.62]She got a smooch.
[30:57.12]Here comes a... What did he just do?
[31:11.05]Freshly smoked cigarette.
[31:12.81]Somebody was just here.
[31:17.90]What happened?
[31:19.24]Oh, God.
[31:19.78]He's gonna take the gun.
[31:22.94]Oh, did you drop this?
[31:25.32]I'll be confiscating it.
[31:30.34]You have to pull the trigger.
[31:32.18]Let's get it back.
[31:35.27]The suspect has your gun.
[31:36.29]Track him down.
[31:37.21]Here we go.
[31:37.63]Track him down with the evidence machine, right?
[31:42.00]You need a weapon.
[31:42.52]Grab a pipe or a 2x4 off the wall.
[31:47.55]Yeah.
[31:47.87]Go be like Hacksaw Jim Duggan.
[31:53.99]2x4.
[31:54.21]You need a weapon.
[31:54.97]Grab a pipe or a 2x4.
[31:56.21]Wait, like I just rip a pipe off the wall?
[32:02.32]What?
[32:04.14]Holy shit.
[32:08.36]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[32:12.45]Move object.
[32:13.21]Alright.
[32:15.07]That's how you block.
[32:17.43]Blocking temporarily stuns the enemy, giving you an opportunity to attack.
[32:21.55]That sounds like a plan to me.
[32:27.88]What the fuck?
[32:30.66]Where did he just go?
[32:32.38]That guy climbed into the ceiling.
[32:34.50]Where?
[32:34.82]Okay.
[32:41.89]Can I not do that?
[32:49.62]Don't mind my eating, by the way.
[32:50.82]I'm sorry.
[32:52.94]Whoa.
[32:54.42]Oh, shit.
[32:54.70]There he is.
[32:59.12]What?
[33:00.36]Somebody else is in here.
[33:01.67]Oh, my God.
[33:02.11]They're all falling down.
[33:02.85]All these fucking Oscar the Grouchos.
[33:07.90]What?
[33:08.62]Why?
[33:08.86]Why?
[33:10.04]Alright, you won.
[33:15.11]Winner moves on.
[33:19.27]Well, they are psychos, right?
[33:20.47]It does make some sense.
[33:24.07]Just becomes every man for himself.
[33:25.35]Where's the guy with my gun?
[33:33.07]Oh, I hear something.
[33:37.37]Why am I getting this weird sepia food?
[33:42.24]He's coming real slow.
[33:45.70]Oh.
[33:46.50]He wasn't real.
[33:48.47]I'm one of the inmates, aren't I?
[33:51.41]I'm one of the Arkham inmates.
[33:52.65]I am myself a drug addict, right?
[33:57.58]Break glass to get the health kits.
[34:01.79]It's gonna be just like that movie where like you thought the guy was like the detective the whole movie, but then he turns out he's like the inmate.
[34:06.98]What movie is that?
[34:11.44]Let me spoil it.
[34:12.18]Is that what happens?
[34:12.92]That's what happens.
[34:14.10]That is what happens.
[34:14.82]I'm just judging by past experience.
[34:21.56]Max Payne.
[34:25.28]Fire Axe Required.
[34:26.43]Okay.
[34:28.83]Well, looks like we gotta get a fire axe.
[34:33.53]Should I take, like, the dead snake?
[34:38.34]Alright, I've got the snake skin.
[34:39.94]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[34:42.54]Uh, this is... Block, reach, and damage.
[34:45.44]So we're gonna definitely take that.
[34:49.18]This is a lot more elaborate than I thought it was gonna be.
[34:51.34]This game's cool.
[34:57.03]Where did the other officers go?
[35:00.31]Yeah, it's all clear.
[35:02.76]Nah, I need a fire axe.
[35:05.62]Where that is, I'm not so sure.
[35:06.98]Looks like a rope.
[35:15.42]Fire axe, fire axe, everything needs a fire axe.
[35:21.49]No.
[35:23.33]Come on.
[35:24.15]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[35:24.73]He's dead.
[35:25.05]Oh, not fine.
[35:26.27]I need my gun back.
[35:27.21]You know he does.
[35:28.53]What do you mean you believe?
[35:29.44]What?
[35:45.09]Hey, easy.
[35:45.57]I was not ready for that.
[35:46.39]You didn't even give me a one, two, three.
[35:47.73]Yeah.
[36:02.94]I have a taser, too.
[36:03.50]That's cool.
[36:04.84]Yeah, alright.
[36:05.26]So, wait.
[36:05.58]Mouse, too, would fire a taser.
[36:07.64]This really is Batman.
[36:08.52]Ha ha!
[36:32.61]Next to the... Grab?
[36:35.45]No, I don't want the pipe.
[36:36.11]I need the fire axe.
[36:40.18]We can just... Here's Johnny through doors.
[36:45.34]That's so cool.
[36:47.24]Holy shit!
[36:48.86]Oh my god, he's a bad man.
[36:49.84]He doesn't have a weapon, though.
[36:51.80]It's alright.
[36:52.37]Like, don't worry about it, because... Oh, he just ran by him.
[36:55.09]Does he have a shotgun?
[36:55.97]What the hell is he holding?
[36:58.17]Oh no, he got a weapon.
[37:02.74]Oh, this is going to be very... What?
[37:04.10]I'm going to bury this in his fucking head.
[37:08.16]My fucking tiny like eight inch foot.
[37:14.50]Oh, nice.
[37:17.93]The kick is never going to work.
[37:19.13]My legs are like fucking four inches long.
[37:26.61]Zap this guy.
[37:27.35]I'm going to zap the guy that had the lead pipe.
[37:33.15]When he turns the corner, I'm gonna electrocute the shit out of him, and he's gonna go... I'm already guaranteed.
[37:41.05]Here he comes.
[37:43.57]Come on.
[37:43.97]Come on.
[37:54.94]Where are you?
[37:55.32]I've been facing tougher enemies.
[38:06.30]Is this a tougher enemy?
[38:07.26]Doesn't look like it.
[38:07.84]Is he going to come through the door?
[38:10.74]Which door is he going to go through?
[38:11.60]This is like the last level in Left 4 Dead.
[38:14.22]Remember that rooftop level in the first mission in Left 4 Dead?
[38:17.22]Here we go.
[38:18.54]And... I told you.
[38:27.95]I told... I fucking heard him coming.
[38:37.07]What the fuck?
[38:38.27]That was... I just... Is he dead?
[38:40.51]I think so.
[38:44.84]This game's fucking good.
[38:46.66]I'm glad I played this.
[38:49.32]Oh shit, I hear somebody.
[38:55.26]Aren't you guys glad we got to play this instead of like Assassin's Creed?
[39:00.67]Why would I even want to play Assassin's Creed?
[39:03.91]What the fuck was I thinking?
[39:11.01]Did I come from here?
[39:18.44]The sound design in this game is awesome.
[39:23.42]I thought that was a guy.
[39:24.46]It was just me.
[39:27.42]I think I'm running in a circle.
[39:29.86]No?
[39:30.28]Okay.
[39:35.80]No.
[39:37.02]Get over here.
[39:38.60]Oh god, there's two people.
[39:41.72]That guy instantly died.
[39:42.70]Here comes the other one.
[39:43.42]Around the corner?
[39:43.98]He's gonna try to come behind me.
[39:45.07]There he is, yep.
[39:47.89]Wow!
[39:48.37]I didn't know he was gonna swing back quickly.
[39:53.25]We didn't block it.
[39:57.80]Wow, this guy is kick- this guy is like kicking my ass.
[40:11.12]Oh, yay, yay.
[40:11.80]No, no, no, I don't want this.
[40:14.86]Fire axe.
[40:18.51]Oh, tase.
[40:18.95]That's right, tase.
[40:19.77]I gotta remember that.
[40:24.41]I do have a taser.
[40:26.23]I should probably use it.
[40:32.54]Can't fire axe this?
[40:41.47]I think I ran in a circle.
[40:44.53]I did.
[40:44.95]I did.
[40:53.16]What the fuck?
[40:54.50]Oh, it's the suspect.
[40:56.08]Get the gun.
[40:56.56]Give me the gun.
[41:10.84]And the path takes strange turns.
[41:13.35]Boom.
[41:16.77]What?
[41:19.33]Be ready for death, Agent Thomas.
[41:22.05]I shall come visit you.
[41:23.89]Two highly trained police officers.
[41:26.99]What?
[41:35.13]Drop the favorite weapon.
[41:37.03]Boot.
[41:41.69]The second guy clearly had like a full five seconds to shoot him.
[41:50.71]Okay, well I didn't find any birds.
[41:53.63]That just means I pressed space a bunch of times.
[41:58.67]Enemies killed.
[41:59.21]Killed by firearm.
[42:00.89]Melee hit and miss 22%.
[42:03.21]Successful hits 19%.
[42:03.91]This is cool.
[42:06.61]I like this a lot.
[42:08.01]Whose heart is that?
[42:08.81]Oh, it's a bird.
[42:10.93]Is that what birds look like on the inside?
[42:13.03]I thought it was a bunch of feathers and some, like, juice.
[42:18.17]They have hearts and shit?
[42:21.49]Birds have lungs?
[42:24.03]I thought they were full of, like, liquid.
[42:27.04]Liquid and, like, some little, like, bits.
[42:42.75]Crush me!
[42:52.75]So I've gone crazy.
[42:59.00]Yeah, I thought fish were just like bones and gills.
[43:06.30]Are there monsters in this game?
[43:14.38]Yeah, where do you guys think orange juice comes from?
[43:15.76]It comes from orange birds.
[43:18.16]They just squeeze them.
[43:18.96]They wring them out into a fucking cup.
[43:21.94]Who are you?
[43:22.98]What is going on?
[43:23.96]Calm yourself.
[43:25.69]My name is Malcolm Van Horn.
[43:28.19]I was a great friend of your father's.
[43:32.63]Yes, I remember you a long time ago, but why are you here now?
[43:37.27]Last night?
[43:38.61]Well, I was nearby.
[43:40.89]An unfortunate scene.
[43:42.09]You did your best, but it could not be helped.
[43:45.47]The detectives, they're dead.
[43:47.01]Milk comes from white birds?
[43:48.07]No.
[43:48.49]Shot with your weapon.
[43:50.49]And you will be blamed for their deaths.
[43:54.38]Milk comes from a cow.
[43:55.48]Yeah.
[43:56.32]Ridiculous.
[43:56.94]I'll just tell them.
[43:57.72]What?
[43:58.22]They just grab him and they fucking wring him out and they crush him up into the glass.
[44:02.88]This is insane.
[44:03.54]I can't just give up the bureau.
[44:05.56]It's already been taken from you.
[44:08.00]Now join me and help yourself.
[44:13.32]Open up, it's the police.
[44:16.68]So I'm the murderer.
[44:17.68]Take your bag and head across to the metro station.
[44:20.52]We'll meet you later.
[44:21.58]And lemonade comes from trees.
[44:23.11]They just grab them, they bring them up, and they crush them up, and they ring them into a glass.
[44:28.39]Maple syrup and shit, they just crush it up and ring it up.
[44:31.43]Guys, everything can be determined.
[44:34.66]Everything that you've ever eaten or drank was somebody grabbed an organism and wrung it out into a glass.
[44:40.46]Tell me I'm wrong.
[44:45.34]Let's talk real and not make jokes.
[44:47.20]Orange juice, wring it out into a glass.
[44:48.80]Oranges.
[44:49.64]Milk, you wring the cow's penises into the glass.
[44:53.28]You wring it out.
[44:56.44]Maple syrup, you wring out the fucking tree stump.
[44:58.62]You crush it up and you wring it out.
[45:00.08]Here comes maple syrup.
[45:03.80]Tomatoes.
[45:04.76]Tomato paste.
[45:05.56]You ring up, you crush up, and you ring the tomato.
[45:09.82]Spaghetti.
[45:10.52]You take wheat flour and you ring it out so it gets thick and it gets into the tubes.
[45:14.02]You ring it into the machine and it closes down and makes it scientific.
[45:23.34]Babies.
[45:24.32]You ring out something.
[45:30.63]I got a new kick.
[45:31.59]Now it's like a karate kick.
[45:38.23]You guys know what I'm saying.
[45:41.21]We're just having a fucking little bit of a comedian comedy actor.
[45:43.41]Alright, I need to stop like fucking talking so I can know where to go.
[45:49.57]Shovel required.
[45:50.39]Okay, gonna buy a shovel.
[45:55.49]How did I get out here?
[46:00.07]In quotes.
[46:00.99]Comedy.
[46:03.05]Did I run?
[46:03.41]There it is.
[46:04.47]There's a shovel.
[46:06.57]Yeah, I'll take it.
[46:08.67]It's like in Home Alone 2.
[46:09.91]The Shovel Lady.
[46:15.00]That's not how that works.
[46:17.64]That would be very, very insecure.
[46:19.12]I was trying to jump onto this.
[46:28.18]There's no jump.
[46:29.76]Oh, fuck.
[46:30.44]I hear running.
[46:31.20]Is he behind me or is he in front of me?
[46:38.91]I don't know.
[46:40.51]This game sincerely does atmosphere very well, though.
[46:45.69]This is great.
[46:46.31]Alright, I think we're gonna have to beat this game.
[46:48.53]And then we're gonna have to play the next one, Condemned 2.
[46:57.11]I'm insecure?
[46:57.93]What?
[46:59.47]Am I?
[47:00.39]I don't think so.
[47:00.87]Look at how menacing that is.
[47:07.49]Yeah, just open up the door.
[47:09.41]Just open the door up.
[47:10.16]I just need to come in for a minute.
[47:15.36]Whoa.
[47:18.18]Condemned 2 isn't on PC.
[47:19.40]That's okay, because I have it on PlayStation 3.
[47:21.30]I can do that, too.
[47:33.28]Oh, here we go.
[47:33.96]I gotta get ready.
[47:34.66]Collection tool.
[47:35.34]What does it want me to do?
[47:39.90]See, those are all my screenshots.
[47:44.56]Why do I want all these?
[47:45.66]I'm going to get the arrows locked up.
[47:49.44]I'm going to have to make sure it's in the right spot.
[47:51.94]There it is.
[47:52.88]Click.
[47:56.17]Got the evidence.
[47:56.73]It's on PC?
[47:57.41]It's not on Steam.
[48:05.02]Space Age camera.
[48:05.98]Is that one of those old phones?
[48:08.07]Of course it is, but hold on.
[48:09.57]We'll wait a minute.
[48:11.15]Hmm.
[48:26.16]Find a good source of the liquid detected on photos what I was gonna say is what was is this one of those phones that goes
[48:54.41]You know those phones that used to go... And it was a walkie-talkie?
[49:00.34]What are you doing?
[49:02.28]It was pretty revolutionary for its time.
[49:06.28]Hey, what's up, man?
[49:07.50]Hey, no, I'm just a... Fuck shit off, man!
[49:13.34]What was it called?
[49:14.96]A Nextel!
[49:15.64]There you go, Nextel.
[49:17.38]Everybody had a Nextel.
[49:21.98]How many tools do I have?
[49:26.08]How many fucking tools do I have?
[49:28.30]Where do I keep these?
[49:29.28]I have like a literal Batman utility belt of shit.
[49:32.47]That's the fourth different tool that I have.
[49:37.11]C41 color photo developer fluid.
[49:40.01]Common among shutterbugs who develop their own color shots.
[49:42.87]Safer to develop your own.
[49:44.25]No record at the photo mats.
[49:46.09]Okay.
[49:46.45]So wait, these photos were processed here, somewhere within the station?
[49:50.08]That would be my guess.
[49:53.02]What joke?
[49:53.88]I'm not making a joke.
[49:54.84]I'm telling you guys... I'm telling you guys of a thing that used to be like when I was a child.
[50:04.69]Whoa!
[50:07.84]Holy shit.
[50:08.50]Got ya.
[50:19.86]Oh wait, I just had an option.
[50:20.94]I just had an option.
[50:21.86]I had a one, two, three, and a four option.
[50:25.80]Alright, I'm gonna keep this crowbar.
[50:30.06]So you can do executions, huh?
[50:32.99]That's so cool.
[50:36.08]No, what I was trying to say is just Nextel was something that we used when we were kids.
[50:43.82]You know?
[50:46.42]And it was awesome.
[50:47.08]It was a walkie-talkie.
[50:48.18]It didn't charge you anything.
[50:50.02]It didn't cost money to do the da-da-ding.
[50:53.22]Alright, what's the objective?
[50:56.98]Escape into the metro train station.
[50:58.50]Well, I'm not doing that.
[50:59.95]I'm doing the opposite.
[51:05.26]Hmm, so I can't get in here.
[51:09.09]Do I have to like climb over this?
[51:14.11]There's no jump, huh?
[51:16.39]What about in here?
[51:18.91]Yeah, I can use the crowbar on this.
[51:22.98]Open the bay door.
[51:23.70]There's gonna be a guy right here.
[51:25.76]Nope.
[51:28.42]Someone's in here.
[51:33.28]God.
[51:34.42]Deluxe.
[51:35.45]Luke Craig.
[51:38.65]Good thing I was not... Where's he going?
[51:43.13]See, this guy has a police jacket on.
[51:45.21]See, I told you.
[51:45.81]Everybody that has a police jacket on isn't the police.
[51:50.93]Wrong guy.
[51:58.03]Oh, that guy got annihilated.
[51:59.49]Where'd he go?
[52:00.97]He's trying to wrap around me.
[52:18.91]It was fucking brutal.
[52:21.17]I've never seen... You know, I've seen plenty of neck snaps in video games.
[52:26.17]But not one-handed.
[52:28.35]Grabbing a guy's chin and throwing it backwards.
[52:30.78]I've never seen a one-handed neck snap.
[52:33.82]Cheese poos.
[52:45.23]Anything else I can open?
[52:50.40]Nope.
[52:52.16]Nope.
[52:54.24]Conduit.
[52:54.80]Speed and block.
[52:55.70]Less damage.
[52:57.20]I'm going to hold on to it.
[53:00.67]I like the crowbar.
[53:01.33]It's fun.
[53:05.37]Locked.
[53:06.61]What about over here?
[53:08.65]Across from the cheese doodles.
[53:12.25]I was already here.
[53:12.87]Make sure I don't miss anything, though.
[53:14.03]There could be a secret weapon.
[53:16.57]Everyone here is so obsessed with melee weapons, even their calendars are melee weapons.
[53:23.38]That's kind of insane.
[53:25.80]What's the book?
[53:27.66]Telephone Directory.
[53:28.64]Yeah, they don't make those anymore.
[53:33.10]Colonel Cheese Poos for the next Rumble.
[53:37.55]I don't know about that.
[53:42.78]Usually, we're going to have naked ladies, sexy lady calendar.
[53:47.63]No, it's a picture of a wrench.
[53:49.39]Oh, look at that wrench.
[53:50.55]I love wrenches, man.
[53:51.81]That wrench is so awesome looking.
[54:00.01]Press this button?
[54:01.20]No.
[54:04.56]The manager's office.
[54:08.96]Five, 15.
[54:09.91]Let's take a look at this developer.
[54:13.27]News.
[54:15.17]It's a pretty good dev working on this game.
[54:20.21]Waiting for the inevitable guy to smash through the glass or something.
[54:27.10]Can I pick up the dirty mop?
[54:28.26]Oh.
[54:33.49]God damn it, this is Thomas.
[54:37.54]I can't move.
[54:38.14]Oh well.
[54:38.62]That was the MySpace guy.
[54:39.54]That was Tom from MySpace.
[54:41.14]That really did look like it.
[54:43.38]Bring back Captain Crunch.
[55:07.70]So I have some instincts, apparently.
[55:11.68]I'm an instinctual man.
[55:14.38]Okay.
[55:15.95]Well, let's break this.
[55:17.39]I don't think I can.
[55:21.73]Well, that was weird.
[55:27.15]I hear somebody shuffling around.
[55:31.21]God damn it.
[55:33.47]I hear, like, the little pitter-patter of feet.
[55:36.29]There he is.
[55:38.25]See?
[55:38.89]Look, dude, I already just tried that.
[55:40.14]It doesn't work.
[55:42.40]He just did the same thing.
[55:43.34]I'm just watching a replay ghost from Mario Kart do what I just did.
[55:48.56]He's gonna come in here, and he's gonna be like, oh, this is scary.
[55:58.67]Well, might as well just get to full health.
[56:04.91]Come on.
[56:05.37]Come on in.
[56:05.69]Oh, fuck!
[56:12.29]Alright, what am I going to do to this guy?
[56:16.51]God damn it!
[56:18.47]I'm too busy focusing on what I want to do to him.
[56:21.81]I have to actually kill him first.
[56:28.52]Upstairs.
[56:28.70]Upstairs.
[56:31.84]That's just my feet.
[56:34.44]Alright, lookit.
[56:35.06]There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... There are 10 steps here.
[56:39.62]Why do I take, like, 60 steps?
[56:41.50]I thought someone was behind me.
[56:42.48]Listen to this.
[56:45.79]Was that... Hold on.
[56:48.59]1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14... I'm a horse.
[56:52.89]I have, like, fucking four back legs.
[56:58.35]I actually do.
[56:59.03]It's four back legs.
[57:00.17]It's okay.
[57:00.45]At least it was... ...determined.
[57:07.02]Sledgehammer required.
[57:08.46]Keep away.
[57:08.94]Okay, well, remind me.
[57:11.98]Reddit, remind me in 20 minutes to go back with a sledgehammer.
[57:21.21]Reddit, slash, remind me in two years.
[57:25.33]Okay, I will remind you in two years to go back and to get the sledgehammer.
[57:29.05]Thanks, Reddit.
[57:37.84]Is this coffee?
[57:40.39]That's a big coffee can.
[57:45.65]Blank, kick the can, just like we used to do when we were kids.
[57:50.65]This is an old pastime.
[57:55.90]No, remember these te- I used to have this exact TV.
[57:58.74]This is a Magnavox.
[58:00.54]With the VCR in the front.
[58:02.85]Oh, these things were fantastic.
[58:08.17]I used to sit with one of these on my lap in my bed.
[58:11.78]Because I didn't have a desk or anything to put it on.
[58:14.22]So I would watch wrestling.
[58:16.34]I would lie in my fucking bed with this sitting on my crotch.
[58:19.13]Plugged into the wall next to me.
[58:20.75]And I'd be watching wrestling on it.
[58:23.91]You know how you use an iPad lying down in bed?
[58:26.10]That's how I used these TVs.
[58:33.80]Your lap, did it hurt?
[58:34.90]It was like in bed with me.
[58:36.34]It was like lying down next to me sometimes.
[58:38.14]I would like roll over and put it in the bed.
[58:42.11]Music stopped.
[58:44.93]Why?
[58:47.81]Oh, wait.
[58:50.91]What's the purpose of being able to move this?
[58:53.34]I thought there was going to be a guy behind there.
[58:57.48]Jesus, don't scare me like that.
[59:04.47]I still need a sledgehammer.
[59:08.46]Archives.
[59:10.42]There's the sledgehammer.
[59:11.24]Can I wrap around?
[59:13.62]I guess I can.
[59:26.87]What?
[59:27.53]What's going on?
[59:28.05]Open.
[59:29.85]I can't open this.
[59:34.14]There's no animation to even just do this?
[59:37.80]Why?
[59:39.64]Okay, well, that's dumb.
[59:46.13]Is there another way up?
[59:52.13]Manager.
[59:52.71]I hear shuffling again.
[59:59.33]Nothing useful.
[60:00.19]Well, I guess that is kind of useful, but I can't... There's no jump or anything.
[60:04.81]It's just The Legend of Zelda.
[60:09.53]Is this going to go up on YouTube?
[60:11.20]I'm assuming.
[60:12.64]If it's interesting enough, then there'll probably be a highlight of it.
[60:17.02]However long we play for.
[60:19.80]I'm very interested in this game.
[60:21.60]And that is, ladies and gentlemen, our first shotgun.
[60:24.03]Let's test it out on this guy's head.
[60:29.61]have even used that that was dumb can I not have a melee weapon out too oh man you can only have a gun you can't have both well these are like the hard decisions that the game was trying to make me make
[60:55.93]I don't like how far close the shotgun is in my mouth, though.
[60:59.19]This guy also has a gun.
[61:00.48]The first crazy person with a gun.
[61:07.10]Okay, gun.
[61:08.82]He got me in the head.
[61:10.97]There's brain matter on the ground.
[61:13.83]What's better?
[61:14.23]No, stick with the shotgun, right?
[61:16.67]How many bullets do I have?
[61:17.81]There's one shot left.
[61:25.57]God damn it, really?
[61:29.51]Come on, are you serious?
[61:30.35]There we go, archive.
[61:40.91]Oh, that guy was going really fast.
[61:44.51]Hold on, let me just use my horse hooves and get up the stairs here.
[61:52.64]I have one bullet left, one shot, one kill for this guy that's in here.
[62:05.83]Just unlocking these doors so they can be opened in case I get lost, which I will.
[62:10.77]There he is.
[62:12.17]Nice and easy.
[62:12.77]He's hiding over here.
[62:17.15]I know you're in here, man.
[62:18.21]Like, I just saw you run over here.
[62:19.55]Where is he?
[62:21.55]Is he in there?
[62:24.59]Where the fuck is he?
[62:27.61]Oh, he must have climbed up.
[62:29.61]Shit, I don't want to... God damn it, I don't want to lose the shotgun.
[62:33.43]Looks like I have to.
[62:39.31]I just hurt myself.
[62:40.25]Wait, you can use the... I can use this as a weapon?
[62:42.61]Okay, that's cool.
[62:45.75]I did not know that.
[62:48.89]I got the sledgehammer.
[62:50.81]All is right in the world.
[62:51.67]Let's head back.
[62:59.36]hi there he's turning off the lights did he just break the TV how did he do that I tried that and it didn't work get karate kicked alright here we go uh we're gonna slam
[63:27.32]Alright, slam is not as cool as snap.
[63:31.60]Slam, snap.
[63:35.38]Whoa, where?
[63:37.14]Oh, Jesus.
[63:39.58]Fuck, I need to get that down.
[63:47.39]Whoa, he just missed.
[63:50.09]How did I not block that?
[63:52.75]What?
[63:56.79]I guess you have to be really early.
[64:00.67]Yeah, you gotta queue that up way early.
[64:02.19]It's gonna be exact.
[64:08.00]Slam, snap, or slap.
[64:09.94]What is... I slap him in the face and it kills him?
[64:13.48]So we've done snap.
[64:15.08]We've done slam.
[64:16.94]Now it's time to do slap.
[64:19.30]Slap.
[64:23.82]It's not a frame-perfect shield, I know.
[64:25.60]That's too bad.
[64:26.14]And look at that.
[64:26.54]We've got a mannequin in the water.
[64:28.72]Tainted water.
[64:30.32]Oh.
[64:35.62]I mean, this is cool.
[64:36.70]No.
[64:36.94]We've got to keep this ledge hammer, right?
[64:39.14]Which seems like the best thing to have.
[64:43.52]Someone's in here.
[64:49.08]I thought he was going to be right around the corner.
[64:50.82]Where is he?
[64:54.47]Is he above me?
[64:57.63]He's right behind this door.
[65:04.53]Is there like a sneak button?
[65:07.21]Crouch?
[65:15.60]Maybe I should have the flashlight off for some things.
[65:19.38]I'm gonna scare the shit out of myself with the flashlight off.
[65:21.84]You guys understand?
[65:27.83]What?
[65:28.25]What?
[65:33.27]I heard stairs.
[65:34.69]Didn't you?
[65:49.70]This game is fucking with me so much.
[65:52.32]Dude, we've... And look.
[65:54.38]It's only been like three minutes.
[65:59.20]Serial killer police beds overwhelmed by violence.
[66:03.04]How do you know this number anyway?
[66:04.60]My potential Again with the instincts
[66:30.64]God.
[66:34.80]Alright.
[66:41.40]So, crowbar.
[66:42.74]God damn it, I don't have a crowbar.
[66:43.78]God damn it.
[66:44.56]Five o'clock.
[66:44.98]God damn it.
[66:46.78]I'm just gonna pull the fire alarm.
[66:50.94]Dude, you guys remember that shit in high school?
[66:53.88]I remember, like, people used to pull the fire alarm in high school.
[66:57.91]And I'm not really middle school, but holy shit, it was annoying.
[67:04.89]Just be like... It's like, oh great, somebody pulled the fucking fire alarm like a dummy.
[67:13.46]It happened maybe once a year.
[67:16.00]Wait, I can open that.
[67:20.86]That's illegal?
[67:21.46]Yeah, I know, and it was really fucking annoying.
[67:28.57]oh boy a pump shotgun like three or four times a year that where you at where you're at oh my god that's so irritating no they weren't fire I remember fire drills in fire drills scared the shit out of me even when I knew they were happening there's something about a school fire alarm that is terrifying it's it's it's it's way too much
[67:54.53]I'm going to show you guys what I consider to be a per- I can't- Can I- Can I alt-tab?
[67:57.62]Let me save the game before I lose everything.
[67:59.68]Well, that would have been real fucking awful.
[68:04.20]Okay.
[68:05.36]Thank God I decided to press escape.
[68:07.86]Because we would have been- That was an hour and fucking ten minutes of- That I didn't save.
[68:12.43]So, F5.
[68:12.91]Okay.
[68:19.41]Um, so.
[68:21.21]I wonder if the game's going to crash.
[68:22.23]If it does, we can, um-
[68:24.32]Let me see what happens if I hit this button.
[68:27.74]We're doing a test.
[68:30.98]Testing.
[68:32.28]Because this is important for us to discuss.
[68:36.16]Like this, a fire alarm, right?
[68:40.53]This is not cool.
[68:41.57]Okay, hold on.
[68:42.05]Before I do this, I've got to make sure this is not going to blow everybody's eardrums out.
[68:44.87]Hold on.
[68:54.00]So, this is what I'm talking about.
[68:59.52]Where is it?
[69:00.68]Okay, here we go.
[69:08.06]It's very low.
[69:09.50]This is just... Like, this is... I would be okay with this.
[69:15.07]Right?
[69:17.27]That's not horrible.
[69:20.73]What I'm not okay with... I gotta find it.
[69:27.52]It's the one that like hurts your body.
[69:34.66]Every time I hear it, it hurts my body.
[69:42.49]What?
[69:46.27]This is a loud fire alarm?
[69:49.97]Why would I subscribe to this?
[69:53.73]Subscribe to this?
[69:55.75]That's not even the right one.
[70:01.55]Where am I gonna find this?
[70:08.01]They're all just... Do these exist anymore?
[70:16.68]Let's see.
[70:17.30]This might be it.
[70:23.94]He's like, this guy has a key for this.
[70:26.07]What?
[70:29.29]There, see?
[70:29.55]See?
[70:34.80]You get the idea.
[70:35.56]The one that hurts.
[70:41.55]Let's turn this back up.
[70:42.25]Hopefully we didn't lose anything.
[70:43.13]But you know what I'm saying?
[70:44.19]The one that's like... I'm not going to turn it up.
[70:49.94]No way.
[70:50.26]I'm not going to put you guys through that shit.
[70:54.04]I just wanted to make a point.
[70:54.82]Why are there no bullets in this?
[70:57.74]Huh?
[71:00.25]Huh?
[71:05.80]Why did I lose the bullets?
[71:09.92]What the fuck?
[71:12.20]All this is so quiet.
[71:13.07]You know how paranoid I am to, like, blow somebody's eardrums out?
[71:17.99]How do I turn it around?
[71:23.47]Oh.
[71:23.59]Okay.
[71:24.93]Well, I gotta get the tool ready.
[71:27.23]Here we go.
[71:27.85]Another tool.
[71:30.15]Put this down.
[71:30.49]Put it down.
[71:30.75]Put it down.
[71:31.01]Put it down.
[71:31.25]Put it down.
[71:31.71]Put it down.
[71:33.57]I have, like, a drug addict to kill.
[71:37.93]Is this PUBG?
[71:39.43]Was this PUBG shotgun detection?
[71:41.09]Give me a break.
[71:46.19]What happened to Assassin's Creed Origins?
[71:47.79]It was unrecordable.
[71:51.96]Okay, so let's pull out our sixth device.
[71:55.94]Track the source of the odor.
[71:58.06]Hmm, where's the source of the odor?
[71:59.63]I have no idea.
[72:01.09]I can't seem to find it.
[72:05.03]Hold it in under my ass.
[72:06.71]There it is.
[72:08.35]What could it be?
[72:09.07]It actually is a dead bird.
[72:12.96]Oh, wow.
[72:15.44]Somebody must have rang out all the orange juice.
[72:18.80]What?
[72:20.16]That's not what I needed to pick up.
[72:21.68]It wasn't the dead bird?
[72:26.30]Uh.
[72:27.96]Yeah.
[72:29.56]I'm confused.
[72:32.31]I was trying to make an eye farted joke and it didn't work.
[72:36.12]I pulled the trigger too early on that one.
[72:38.54]Whatever, I got one shot left.
[72:42.14]Please try playing Assassin's Creed in the future.
[72:43.72]I really wish I could.
[72:47.78]Flip it around, because I got no bullets.
[72:53.12]Okay, what about... Slap, right?
[72:54.50]Slap.
[72:55.96]No, that... What did I just... What?
[72:59.70]What the hell did I just do?
[73:02.18]Okay, punch.
[73:04.10]I'll take this, man.
[73:07.75]Alright, ram puts him back up.
[73:14.40]I thought there were no bullets left.
[73:17.34]There's supposed to be no bullets left.
[73:18.68]Just give me the fucking 2x4 with the pipe on it.
[73:26.55]I missed the time.
[73:27.19]What time is it?
[73:31.05]What time?
[73:31.41]5.
[73:33.59]It's always 5.
[73:34.83]Oh, there it is.
[73:37.26]Okay, they have five... It's been the same time.
[73:43.30]You have Ram just kind of... You put your shoulder into him and he... He gets back up.
[73:49.69]I'm not sure what the utilization for that is, but I'm sure it's something cool.
[73:59.58]I really do like this game, though.
[74:00.82]This is actually very... When did this come out?
[74:03.20]When did the first one come out?
[74:04.68]Because this is...
[74:13.28]He just faked me out.
[74:15.32]Is that guy dead back there?
[74:20.10]Alright, Ram.
[74:24.22]Okay, Ram is actually pretty cool.
[74:30.30]What happened to this guy?
[74:32.00]This guy just fell over.
[74:32.98]Alright, well, whatever.
[74:43.02]Investigate press follow the follow trail of c41 developer fluid Okay, follow the trail trace the evidence well let me get rid of this guy first Is that the developer fluid Oh
[75:08.28]Do I have to follow that?
[75:09.16]No, no, don't go get it.
[75:10.02]Don't go get something.
[75:10.88]Don't go get something.
[75:12.03]He just ducked.
[75:12.67]What's happening?
[75:14.83]Alright, let's go follow the... Why did I turn off the light?
[75:21.07]Here it is.
[75:21.47]Okay.
[75:24.74]No, that's not it.
[75:25.58]Uh-huh.
[75:29.40]There it goes in there.
[75:36.75]How do I... I gotta open up the door here?
[75:38.09]No.
[75:38.65]I know it goes across this way, but I'm not gonna get myself killed.
[75:43.40]Not yet, at least.
[75:44.44]Not now.
[75:44.90]I need a sledgehammer.
[75:48.50]Can I... Keep going.
[75:53.80]Slimer went this way.
[75:55.86]Oh, fuck.
[75:57.58]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[76:02.44]Watch out!
[76:04.48]Wow, what the hell happened?
[76:06.57]Why does this guy have an explosive on the end?
[76:09.11]What?
[76:11.05]That was unbelievable, he killed the other guy.
[76:14.95]This is the Star Wars kid.
[76:24.51]This dude exploded.
[76:31.26]There's a sledgehammer.
[76:35.01]Pick that up.
[76:36.45]Let's go back and open the door we could have got to.
[76:41.47]That's an old meme.
[76:43.68]The reason why that meme has lasted forever is because it's an original meme.
[76:54.98]That was a meme, in quotes, back when memes didn't exist.
[77:02.74]The word meme didn't even exist back then.
[77:04.34]That's why the Numa Numa guy was dancing and people thought it was funny.
[77:09.38]Think about that.
[77:14.64]The fucking Numa Numa dance guy was funny.
[77:19.32]Look at this.
[77:20.36]Ten years from now, people are going to be looking back on this stream and they're going to be like, holy shit, people thought this guy was funny?
[77:26.47]I'm going to be the new Numa Numa guy.
[77:28.11]People are going to look back and be like, wow, this guy sucks.
[77:35.14]Power off for servicing.
[77:36.38]See maintenance.
[77:41.72]I already think that.
[77:43.67]They say that now.
[77:47.09]Come on.
[77:48.77]Come on.
[77:50.63]Hey, be nice.
[77:52.57]Be nice to the streamer.
[78:05.05]Guys, what's the number one rule here, guys?
[78:08.99]Respect the streamer.
[78:12.76]I can't shoot this with a gun.
[78:13.86]Come on.
[78:15.92]Second rule, respect the streamer.
[78:22.36]Third rule.
[78:24.38]Get out of here.
[78:26.14]No, no, no, don't leave.
[78:26.90]No, don't leave.
[78:30.01]Respect the streamer and leave.
[78:31.45]You're just going to walk in and shake my hand and leave?
[78:38.87]Don't leave.
[78:39.71]Don't leave.
[78:40.35]I'm so desperate.
[78:43.40]Watch, I'll do something funny.
[78:45.26]I'm gonna put my fucking metal fork in the end.
[78:50.68]See?
[78:52.40]I would've just died there in real life.
[79:02.45]I'm already really tired, so I am gonna leave.
[79:03.97]Well, if you're tired, then have a good sleep.
[79:07.03]If not, then condemn criminal origin.
[79:09.01]Wait, what was that?
[79:11.19]Oh, no, I don't want that.
[79:11.81]I don't want the shotgun.
[79:15.47]Elevator power box, yeah.
[79:17.91]This goes down even further.
[79:21.03]Anything else that I need to be aware of?
[79:23.03]I need a fucking fire axe.
[79:27.04]God damn it.
[79:33.02]I've yet to find somebody to shoot this with.
[79:35.46]Who's coming in here?
[79:37.67]What?
[79:45.06]I shot that guy directly into the chest.
[79:47.52]And it didn't even hurt him.
[79:50.64]Guns are terrible in this game.
[79:55.58]Oh god, I just turned into a... I can't even talk.
[79:58.80]A piece of asparagus.
[80:02.41]Can I still use the gun?
[80:04.65]I can.
[80:05.13]I can still use the shotgun.
[80:08.05]This thing is broken into pieces and I can still use it.
[80:18.19]Just give me the fire rag.
[80:25.26]Too slow.
[80:31.50]There is weapon durability.
[80:32.40]That's really interesting.
[80:33.58]I like that.
[80:38.94]I turned the end of that into a Bugs Bunny cartoon, when he blows Daffy Duck's face off.
[80:43.31]Should I just go down here?
[80:45.59]I don't think I want to be down here right now.
[80:55.28]I did miss something.
[80:55.88]I gotta go back to the Power Box room, but... Let's explore for a sec.
[81:00.66]Just a sec.
[81:06.37]Is this going to take me to the power box?
[81:07.83]Huh?
[81:09.07]Where are you?
[81:12.13]Where is he?
[81:13.54]Oh, they're fighting up here.
[81:15.18]How do I climb this?
[81:17.84]Get up there.
[81:18.22]I want to see what happens.
[81:20.46]I'm curious.
[81:20.98]I want to see what happens.
[81:22.58]We already missed the show.
[81:24.18]God damn it.
[81:31.86]He's got a cool weapon, but I don't want it.
[81:36.88]This is where we came to.
[81:38.10]Power box.
[81:39.48]Yep.
[81:43.96]It's very loud.
[81:50.40]Are there bosses in this game?
[81:54.39]There it is.
[81:55.07]Pull the lever.
[81:58.05]That should bring the power back on.
[82:00.79]Somebody was crawling.
[82:01.97]There was just a Resident Evil monster there.
[82:09.02]Are we going to see a new enemy type?
[82:11.10]Am I going to shit my pants?
[82:13.90]He was right here.
[82:22.23]Third floor, I guess.
[82:25.60]No, it's going to be like Gremlins 2.
[82:26.92]They're going to burst through the walls.
[82:28.96]I already know what's going to happen.
[82:29.98]He's going to fall through the ceiling.
[82:32.54]Two giant tube hands are going to come out and grab me.
[82:37.86]Alright, I got the game saved.
[82:38.72]Don't worry.
[82:48.70]You can higher up.
[82:49.52]Alright, where are we now?
[82:51.92]Not that way.
[82:58.22]What?
[82:58.42]Is that a... What's a bird?
[83:00.72]What's wrong with this bird?
[83:04.70]I can just pick up a live bird?
[83:07.99]Why do I want this?
[83:10.49]Oh, look, a bird.
[83:11.43]Yeah, I'm going to collect him.
[83:15.25]You know, Greg, we have a problem with your dying bird collection.
[83:18.32]We think that's a little odd.
[83:21.96]Oh, sorry.
[83:23.46]I just really like the way that they flail around.
[83:27.64]Guy right here.
[83:30.90]Oh, Jesus, where is he?
[83:36.18]I've got a safe crowbar.
[83:37.30]I have an axe.
[83:37.82]Isn't that the same fucking thing?
[83:42.49]I'm collecting them to make bird juice.
[83:45.91]I need to make some orange juice.
[83:51.69]God.
[83:54.99]Oh, I think we have to go left.
[83:57.86]Ah!
[83:58.50]Ah, fuck.
[83:59.76]Ah.
[84:00.02]Ah.
[84:01.06]Ah.
[84:05.19]Another person's coming.
[84:06.03]Why did that door open?
[84:08.44]This door just opened.
[84:12.00]I'm not doing this right.
[84:14.18]There's a person behind me, or what?
[84:16.88]What did I get hurt by?
[84:19.00]Ugh.
[84:20.12]Close this door.
[84:20.84]Fuck.
[84:24.80]What is going on?
[84:25.76]Somebody has a gun?
[84:27.83]Who's shooting a gun?
[84:28.87]Tch.
[84:35.69]He faked me out.
[84:36.33]Fuck you.
[84:36.89]Get out of here.
[84:38.76]Dickhead.
[84:41.44]Oh, he's a... Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[84:45.34]I don't know where he is.
[84:47.74]He's right there.
[84:48.22]Okay.
[84:50.50]This guy's a shotgun.
[84:55.45]What the fuck?
[85:02.81]Somebody's throwing grenades.
[85:05.02]No!
[85:09.33]Is he shooting the ground?
[85:12.95]No, I gotta snap his neck.
[85:14.58]Get him!
[85:15.94]God damn it, you little shit!
[85:24.20]Ram him.
[85:28.81]He was shooting the ground with the gun.
[85:30.99]I thought someone was throwing grenades in the room.
[85:36.97]Damn it.
[85:38.81]Anything in here?
[85:40.15]There's five bullets.
[85:48.14]I have no health.
[85:48.86]I gotta make these shots count.
[85:49.82]Somebody's up there.
[85:55.66]Oh, I forgot I was supposed to be following the trail of fluid.
[85:58.86]Alright, does it go to the men's room or does it go to the women's bathroom?
[86:01.08]Let's see.
[86:01.56]Let's see who's messier.
[86:04.00]It's a battle of the sexes.
[86:06.73]Who has the messier bathroom?
[86:09.30]As you can see, this diarrhea shit stain leads right into, leads away from the bathroom.
[86:19.17]Let's investigate.
[86:21.69]The women's bathroom is filthy.
[86:24.51]I can't believe how filthy the bathroom is.
[86:26.35]Like, zoom in.
[86:26.69]Oh, fuck.
[86:30.46]You know, for years we just neglected it for I don't know how it happened.
[86:34.34]Do you see the fucking toilet?
[86:36.25]It's fucking disgusting.
[86:38.37]I wouldn't even eat out of there.
[86:42.71]How's the men's bathroom?
[86:44.79]I need the sledgehammer.
[86:48.60]But Chef Ramsay wanted to see the men's bathroom too.
[86:53.10]Unbelievable.
[86:54.77]You can't have people come in there.
[86:56.01]Un-fucking-believable.
[86:57.53]Your urinals.
[86:58.55]Your urinals don't have enough spices in them.
[87:03.42]And look.
[87:04.42]There's a dead bird in the toilet.
[87:06.38]Wait.
[87:06.58]We're gonna make this real.
[87:07.28]Hold on.
[87:11.98]Stay right.
[87:12.40]Stay tuned.
[87:12.88]We're gonna make this real.
[87:19.93]Bear with me for a sec.
[87:28.89]Uh, here we go.
[87:31.01]Okay, that was really fucking loud.
[87:34.03]How loud is this?
[87:39.46]This is too... No!
[87:40.78]Wow!
[87:41.46]This is not reality TV music.
[87:47.38]Here it is.
[87:54.16]Okay, here we go.
[88:00.17]when Chef Ramsay went into the men's bathroom.
[88:03.34]Can't believe it.
[88:04.10]He saw something he would never see in his entire life.
[88:08.14]You have bleach inside of the sink.
[88:11.40]How will the blue team be able to recover from this?
[88:14.32]Will the red team capitalize in the women's bathroom?
[88:18.10]I just said that to something.
[88:19.70]I couldn't believe it.
[88:20.54]She actually was trying to hurt me.
[88:22.78]There's a shotgun in the fucking bathroom.
[88:26.58]Let's tune in next time.
[88:28.98]Bathroom battle.
[88:30.88]with Gordon Ramsay on ABC.
[88:34.79]Let's go.
[88:39.21]Now let's play the game again.
[88:51.77]What are we doing?
[88:52.51]Following the drill of puke?
[88:58.52]Whose shotgun was it?
[89:00.10]And who were they planning to kill?
[89:03.29]I think it was Cynthia.
[89:05.89]She's been talking about shooting us all weekend.
[89:10.87]They'll find out.
[89:11.69]Go back for the bird?
[89:16.62]What?
[89:17.20]Who cares?
[89:17.62]Give some shit about a bird.
[89:24.55]And then they interview Cynthia, or like Carol, she's like sitting in the back, she's like rocking in the chair.
[89:30.61]I have no plans.
[89:33.55]I just do whatever they tell me, I do whatever the voices tell me.
[89:36.91]Next week!
[89:38.40]On Bathroom, Bathroom Bitch, whatever the hell it's gonna be called.
[89:41.82]Alright, what am I, follow the trail!
[89:43.86]Where's the bird?
[89:46.26]Oh, the bird in the toilet!
[89:49.26]The toilet bird, I forgot.
[89:53.84]Oh, that's fucking disgusting.
[89:56.21]Salmon.
[89:57.47]Sear.
[89:59.01]Quite.
[90:00.19]Little bit of spice.
[90:01.33]Salt.
[90:01.91]Pepper.
[90:03.35]Flip.
[90:05.63]Bird.
[90:06.61]Collected.
[90:08.67]Exit.
[90:09.01]Bathroom.
[90:10.35]Door.
[90:11.33]Close.
[90:12.78]No door.
[90:20.08]Where have we gone?
[90:24.46]He pushed something.
[90:25.50]He pushed something.
[90:26.76]He pushed this.
[90:29.36]So we can't go that way.
[90:30.12]We have to sneak through this.
[90:31.62]There's another dead bird.
[90:34.62]No, that's a metal piece.
[90:40.57]How do I get out of here?
[90:41.35]He blocked me in.
[90:42.21]He blocked me.
[90:45.47]Can I push?
[90:47.09]I can just move.
[90:47.83]I didn't know I could do that shit.
[90:51.81]Don't be mad at me.
[90:54.53]Checkpoint saved.
[90:57.71]Okay, be careful.
[91:00.93]You can move the fucking... Why am I reading everybody's chat messages as Gordon Ramsay?
[91:08.37]You can move the fucking bureau, you stupid animal.
[91:12.38]You donkey.
[91:16.02]Get out!
[91:17.24]You fucking donkeys.
[91:24.86]What do I do?
[91:25.28]Should I investigate the Mickey Mouse thing?
[91:29.40]Uh, zoom in.
[91:31.95]It's fucking raw!
[91:33.45]Okay, uh, collected.
[91:42.05]We gotta get a break of this case real soon.
[91:45.55]Handprint.
[91:54.50]Oh, I actually did break it.
[91:55.42]Game over.
[91:55.96]Game over, screen.
[91:57.98]Game over.
[91:58.38]I can't listen to the recording ever again.
[92:00.76]Game over.
[92:01.08]Eyes.
[92:01.74]Mustache.
[92:02.04]Mouth.
[92:02.20]You can't unsee it now.
[92:23.58]Head, shoulders, knees, and toes.
[92:26.72]You can't unsee it now.
[92:32.22]What is that?
[92:33.56]Zoom in.
[92:37.51]Somebody was being a fucking creep.
[92:39.79]I thought the alright was the guy in the game.
[92:45.35]Alright, fuck you.
[92:49.24]What am I doing?
[92:49.72]Where am I going?
[92:50.18]I gotta give $100.
[92:50.86]Oh my God, I got, well, Edgemont.
[92:53.77]Hold on.
[92:54.81]Give me a sec.
[92:57.93]I'm gonna save the game.
[93:02.25]Save it.
[93:03.67]Quick save.
[93:04.73]Let me go over some bits.
[93:05.84]Because I have not the whole night, pretty much.
[93:07.90]So let's do that.
[93:10.02]Streamer loses his sanity while pretending to be Gordon Ramsay.
[93:15.84]Oh well.
[93:18.61]Anyways, let's start here.
[93:21.24]First of all, DubskiDude, thanks for the $1.
[93:23.20]What drugs are you on today?
[93:24.36]Absolutely nothing.
[93:25.08]I've eaten a couple of pickles and some slices of bologna.
[93:27.75]So, who knows?
[93:28.91]Maybe that's doing it to me.
[93:30.87]But thank you for the $1.
[93:33.59]Also, thank you to Asha for the $1.
[93:36.41]This guy's fucked.
[93:38.07]I'm sorry.
[93:39.85]I might be.
[93:40.87]And Edgemont gave $100.
[93:42.55]Thank you, Edgemont, for the $100.
[93:44.01]That's a lot of money.
[93:46.71]That Gordon Ramsay joke was too funny.
[93:48.45]Thanks for the laugh.
[93:50.13]I'm glad it was at least close enough where it was funny.
[93:53.81]Thank you, dude.
[93:55.90]If that was a $100 joke, I could do better than that.
[93:58.84]I could do better than that.
[94:00.44]Just watch the next couple streams.
[94:01.68]I'll do better than that.
[94:05.31]But thank you so much, man.
[94:06.81]That's incredibly generous of you.
[94:09.73]Jerma's Nuts, thanks for the $1.
[94:11.78]And he says his message is the C word.
[94:14.98]So I'm not going to say that at the moment.
[94:18.28]I think he's referring to Gordon Ramsay.
[94:20.44]It's just a C word.
[94:22.84]Thank you, though.
[94:24.14]Darkstar7000, thanks for the $1.
[94:27.78]We better get...
[94:30.79]Uh, we better get a slideshow of all these wonderful screenshots at the end of this stream.
[94:34.35]Actually, that might be funny.
[94:35.79]Who knows if I'm going to be able to do that, though.
[94:39.17]Cucumber?
[94:40.61]Coconuts?
[94:42.05]Caffuccino?
[94:42.83]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[94:46.73]Thank you, though, dude.
[94:48.07]Uh, George the Jedi, thanks for the bits.
[94:49.63]Sputnik, thanks for the five dollars.
[94:51.41]Cheers, Jerma.
[94:51.89]The bathroom battle joke was the hardest I've laughed in a while.
[94:53.91]I cried.
[94:54.41]Well, I'm glad you did.
[94:56.77]No, I'm not glad you cried.
[94:57.67]I'm glad you thought it was funny.
[94:59.69]Um...
[95:01.12]We just like to have fun.
[95:02.68]That's all we're doing here.
[95:05.30]If you're having fun and I'm having fun, we're all having fun, then, you know, that's the whole point.

[95:17.55]At Masterfish.
[95:20.07]Verrat, thanks for the five dollars.
[95:21.35]Hey, Jerma, are you excited for the new Monster Hunter?
[95:23.15]Absolutely.
[95:24.51]I can't wait for it.
[95:25.83]Even though I didn't put that much time into...
[95:29.04]I didn't put that much time into Monster Hunter 3.
[95:31.32]What was the one I played for Wii U?
[95:34.28]I played for like three or four streams in a row.
[95:36.03]It was fun.
[95:37.35]New one would be way funnier.
[95:38.83]Funnier?
[95:39.55]Shut up, idiot.
[95:40.27]Dumb fucking moron.
[95:41.57]C word.
[95:42.67]The, uh... Fun, not funnier.
[95:47.19]Oh, God.

[96:27.04]Well, thank you, Zombie Jesus, for the $10.
[96:29.68]Don't call yourself cocky.
[96:33.02]Am I cocky?
[96:33.58]Would you guys consider me cocky?
[96:35.82]Maybe.
[96:36.54]Am I cocky?
[96:37.88]I don't think so.

[97:54.56]Like, I took a look at, like, the bits for the day, and I'm just like, holy shit.
[98:01.36]It's like, is that money?

[98:11.78]HeliosFunk, thanks for the $5.
[98:13.50]Am I going to finish Phantasmagoria 2?
[98:17.10]Probably not.
[98:17.74]That game was just... We got sucked in and it never happened again.
[98:24.29]And that should catch me up until... Yeah, and the ones that I missed from a little bit earlier, we'll go back and do them at the end of the stream.
[98:31.54]But thank you everybody.
[98:32.26]I just wanted to kind of take a minute and say thanks to the people that have, you know, especially some of the bigger donations too that came in that I just didn't even look at.
[98:40.56]Like a fucking piece of crap.
[98:42.83]Uh, let's keep going.
[98:46.71]Scrooge McDuck.
[98:49.21]Not quite Scrooge McDuck.
[98:52.17]Not at that level yet.
[98:54.57]Maybe in like another like 75 million bits.
[98:58.53]Alright, so what's the goal here?
[99:00.51]Locate photographer's darkroom.
[99:01.79]God damn it.
[99:02.71]I need to fucking turn this shit off.
[99:08.34]Uh, the darkroom.
[99:12.12]DuckTales stream?
[99:14.60]You know, they remade DuckTales.
[99:18.32]It was pretty cool.
[99:20.04]Here's the darkroom.
[99:21.36]What?
[99:24.78]Huh?
[99:26.64]You got cut off a little early there.
[99:31.73]Alright.
[99:33.55]Over here?
[99:33.93]You're gonna do the same thing over here?
[99:35.31]This guy holds a camera like a weirdo.
[99:47.72]Click.
[99:53.54]Interesting.
[99:57.90]Look at my screenshot.
[99:58.88]Yeah, this guy's got a lot of dumb screenshots.
[100:02.00]Serial or serial killer?
[100:05.14]Ah.
[100:05.96]The black felt tip pen killer.
[100:06.88]Yep.
[100:07.30]You heard that smash, didn't you?
[100:25.04]Holy shit, a 3D printer.
[100:27.26]I can't wait to print out a version of an amiibo.
[100:31.52]I can't wait to make my own amiibos that don't, you know, are not useless.
[100:36.90]Fuck, did I just say that out loud?
[100:38.26]I think I did.
[100:38.82]Did I say that out loud?
[100:41.37]I may have.
[100:48.27]What the fuck is that?
[100:50.55]What?
[100:52.25]What are you doing here?
[100:56.27]Where did this guy come from?
[100:57.45]I'm like wedged in the back here.
[100:59.05]I'm gonna die.
[101:05.72]He's stuck.
[101:10.24]Who died?
[101:19.28]Was that supposed to happen?
[101:20.42]I think that was... Yeah, this is supposed to...
[101:26.55]I just popped a huge zit.
[101:29.69]That's me.
[101:32.11]Huh?
[101:36.20]God, that was... That alleviated a lot of pressure.
[101:40.18]That was an under-the-skin pimple.
[101:41.58]That was gross.
[101:42.62]Let me see.
[101:47.06]There's probably healing.
[101:50.86]I've been there, man.
[101:51.52]I've had zits like that before.
[101:58.95]I don't want to go in there with this little health.
[102:02.97]The same orange jumpsuit guy.
[102:06.73]I gotta get better at blocking.
[102:08.93]I think I'm missing something with it.
[102:10.29]I'm, like, always missing something.
[102:13.35]Welcome to my streams.
[102:17.47]twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[102:18.79]Or, hey, you missed that.
[102:23.41]important thing.
[102:25.27]Please go back.
[102:26.85]Now you're talking about something unrelated.
[102:29.69]And he's gone.
[102:40.13]You missed that one.
[102:41.37]Try another.
[102:42.09]You missed that one.
[102:45.39]Try another.
[102:51.36]Balcony bird.
[102:56.54]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[102:59.24]I almost got all the birds collected.
[103:07.92]I'm a funny streamer.
[103:12.00]Let me try to get this down.
[103:14.04]I give up.
[103:31.95]Sounds like you eat the bird.
[103:32.91]You actually might be eating the bird.
[103:37.67]I'm a funny streamer.
[103:39.25]Look, I'm going to get ambushed by this guy.
[103:42.14]Shotgun.
[103:49.24]No, flip it around.
[103:51.10]Who's breaking out here?
[103:51.94]Oh, it's a bunch of birds.
[104:05.00]Nothing in there.
[104:06.10]Okay, so we just got attacked by a flock of birds.
[104:11.75]And they all exploded.
[104:14.93]Does that count as a collection?
[104:18.31]Was that just one bird?
[104:19.53]Or did I get all the birds?
[104:21.92]Chapter one is complete.
[104:25.10]Four of six birds, one of three metal pieces.
[104:26.86]You've earned two achievements.
[104:28.24]Chapter two, bronze bird award.
[104:30.64]Favorite weapon, pump shotgun.
[104:32.72]44% hit rate.
[104:33.98]22 enemies killed.
[104:34.64]81% killed by melee.
[104:38.32]And I have a pretty large miss rate.
[104:42.20]Oh, well, whatever.
[104:49.35]We've got to get the bird award at least one time, right?
[104:51.45]It's really important.
[104:55.01]Suspect was last seen passing through this area.
[104:56.71]Track him down.
[104:59.15]You got it.
[105:03.57]How long is condemned one?
[105:05.61]Like six hours?
[105:06.47]Eight hours?
[105:09.25]What's the time on this one?
[105:13.11]Union Station?
[105:16.11]Let's just make sure we didn't miss this.
[105:20.93]Nothing.
[105:21.62]Nothing.
[105:22.70]Nothing in the couch cushions.
[105:30.58]It's two hours.
[105:31.24]I kind of wish there was a jump.
[105:38.32]It's about two hours and five minutes.
[105:40.98]This does more damage.
[105:42.16]That's what I want.
[105:42.72]I'm all about damage.
[105:43.44]I'm slow and damaging.
[105:48.82]I ruin all my relationships because I'm slow and incredibly damaging to anyone I come across.
[105:54.35]There he is.
[105:54.81]Follow him.
[105:55.29]Where is he?
[106:08.09]Is he talking to me?
[106:10.17]That's not the suspect.
[106:13.79]Wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[106:16.47]I can't run now.
[106:18.35]And he tricked me!
[106:19.31]He tricked me, and I even knew what he was doing.
[106:25.60]Wait, grab it!
[106:26.44]Grab it out of his hand!
[106:28.72]Wow, I can't... Hold on, I'm gonna try that.
[106:33.98]Peekaboo.
[106:40.15]Got it.
[106:40.37]Okay, that's cool.
[106:42.51]I didn't know you could do that.
[106:43.37]That's another guy.
[106:47.79]Wait, I need this.
[106:50.33]Is this guy holding a sign?
[106:51.57]Is this WWF?
[106:53.99]This guy's holding like a chair.
[106:56.67]What?
[106:58.87]Oh, here comes Austin with a street sign.
[107:04.28]He just double tapped me.
[107:05.46]I just got double tapped.
[107:12.52]Why did I get hit twice?
[107:13.83]That was stupid.
[107:21.93]That's fucking broken.
[107:22.97]What a broken game.
[107:24.03]What a broken part of the game.
[107:25.65]The street sign hits you two times.
[107:27.19]Not fair.
[107:28.11]Don't like it.
[107:28.71]Not happy.
[107:29.34]Not cool.
[107:40.38]There he is.
[107:41.74]This guy just tore him apart.
[107:46.90]Cause Stone Cold said so.
[107:50.36]And that's the bottom line.
[107:52.10]Cause Stone Cold said so.
[108:08.56]Idiot.
[108:10.08]You fucking idiot.
[108:11.24]Idiot.
[108:13.62]Okay, I'll take it.
[108:19.11]Just doing what he told me to do.
[108:20.59]Here comes the guy with the sign.
[108:21.33]Where's the guy with the sign?
[108:25.11]That guy has a gun.
[108:25.85]Alright, the guy with the sign is going to take out the guy with the gun.
[108:27.96]He's going to wrap around and he's going to smash him in the back of the head.
[108:30.06]Just like somebody sliding in the ring.
[108:38.46]How is he not shooting you?
[108:40.26]A guy with a gun is more of a threat than a guy with a sign, right?
[108:44.16]No, we're doing Ring Around the Rosie.
[108:52.06]Oh my god!
[108:53.55]Did you see that?
[108:54.37]He snuck up behind him and smashed him!
[108:57.87]Oh my humanity!
[108:59.03]He broke him in half!
[109:03.71]Where the fuck is he?
[109:04.81]Give me the gun.
[109:05.53]I want the gun.
[109:06.09]Where's the gun?
[109:09.00]There's the gun.
[109:13.99]I need to shoot this guy with a gun.
[109:17.19]That's how I complete the funny thing.
[109:19.63]The funniness.
[109:23.93]Where's the gun?
[109:24.41]This guy had a gun.
[109:25.93]Ow!
[109:29.39]No, I don't want to hold it like a fucking... Swing it back around.
[109:33.06]Reload it.
[109:34.22]There's no fucking weapon.
[109:35.20]Oh my god.
[109:36.32]Give me a break, dude.
[109:38.30]I have to bash him with the thing.
[109:39.76]Oh, I wonder... Give me that sign.
[109:45.84]Give it to me.
[109:47.02]My turn.
[109:47.42]Alright, we're using the sign from now on.
[109:59.33]I'm probably going to need the fire axe.
[110:02.71]Funniness complete.
[110:05.13]Oh my god, he's broken in half.
[110:09.17]In all my years, I ain't never seen anything like that.
[110:12.74]Yeah, I gotta break this down with a goddamn fire axe.
[110:18.02]Of course.
[110:20.70]Extreme rules match.
[110:24.34]And my Star Trek weapon.
[110:26.76]This sucks.
[110:27.38]I really... Should I break... Oh well.
[110:32.67]It was fun while it lasted.
[110:38.83]I really do love how he came up behind him and buried that sound in the back of his head.
[110:42.87]He was trying to get me, but he just couldn't do it.
[110:50.91]Funniness acquired.
[110:51.77]I need to heal.
[110:55.37]Those things can explode.
[110:56.75]I am certain of it.
[110:58.83]Fire extinguishers?
[111:01.71]Do these explode?
[111:03.85]They might.
[111:04.70]Let's see if it's in this game.
[111:08.18]No.
[111:09.50]There's no explosions in this game.
[111:11.67]At least not from sources that should explode.
[111:17.75]Healing.
[111:19.23]Yes.
[111:25.51]Fire extinguisher would explode if you put that pressure on it.
[111:27.66]Isn't that why it says on the can, do not put contents under pressure?
[111:32.66]It's the same thing with an aerosol can.
[111:35.78]Contents under pressure can cause serious damage.
[111:39.08]That's what it means.
[111:39.86]It means don't hit it with a fire axe.
[111:47.99]Why would it explode?
[111:49.29]Because it's... It's a... Contents under pressure.
[111:58.32]Alright, this is where he closed before anything.
[112:00.52]Any cool weapons?
[112:01.54]Guns?
[112:02.86]Ammo?
[112:04.69]No.
[112:05.59]Well, we have a scene in front of us because we just loaded all the assets.
[112:13.58]I don't think that guy... That guy's not quite alert.
[112:22.94]I think we're fine.
[112:30.99]I love how... Alright, let's do... Let's do... Snap.
[112:39.81]I turned the light back on at the perfect time.
[112:43.98]What was that thing?
[112:45.36]That wasn't a... That wasn't a drug addict.
[112:49.56]That was a samurai with two swords.
[112:51.42]That was not a drug addict.
[112:54.95]I wonder if he sees me coming.
[112:58.25]He's going to grab a weapon.
[112:59.23]Of course he is.
[113:03.43]Yeah, that was a crow hop.
[113:07.07]He's dead, somehow.
[113:08.11]Now I'm going to have to fight a boss.
[113:09.82]The boss is not going to be a drug addict.
[113:11.16]It's going to be the samurai knife thrower.
[113:23.09]Oh no, he's got a... Oh no, this is not good.
[113:28.83]Can I duck?
[113:29.95]Can I duck?
[113:36.97]Why does it keep showing me that image when I die?
[113:40.51]It keeps showing me... I gotta pee.
[113:43.68]Let me go to the bathroom.
[113:45.72]I'll be right back.
[113:47.47]Let me just pee real quick.
[114:23.88]Wait, what?
[116:19.91]Okay, let's do it.
[116:24.88]Let's get back to it.
[116:27.02]Condemned.
[116:29.18]Criminal intent.
[116:32.02]Thank you for your patience.
[116:33.49]Thank you for your patience, thank you.
[116:35.13]Thank you for your patience.
[116:38.51]And here we, and here we go.
[116:47.69]Alright, the joke I was making was I was hoping these guys were going to kill each other, but they won't.
[116:55.17]Okay, here comes the sign.
[117:01.01]Alright, get him with the sign.
[117:07.40]Where did he run off to?
[117:09.30]He took the sign and ran away.
[117:12.54]What does he do?
[117:13.04]Why are you going in such an odd way?
[117:14.90]The direction he's going makes no sense.
[117:27.67]See you later.
[117:31.55]Okay.
[117:32.65]The lights flickering are freaking me out.
[117:34.37]Thank God I got the sign back.
[117:37.69]Damn it.
[117:38.19]Now I have to use this.
[117:41.97]Somebody else is shooting a gun.
[117:45.33]Healing?
[117:45.82]No.
[117:46.10]I have a fire axe.
[117:49.24]Any healing in here?
[117:52.68]No.
[117:53.52]Of course not.
[117:57.18]Um...
[117:59.03]I have nine shots, though.
[118:00.53]This is going to work out well.
[118:01.91]And they're putting fire axes everywhere because I'm going to need to use one.
[118:05.15]That would have been so awesome, and you all know it, if I had just turned on that guy.
[118:10.88]Everyone would have been so proud of me.
[118:14.72]He came back with a shotgun.
[118:16.76]How is he shooting that that fast?
[118:19.74]How are you shooting a shotgun that fast that many times in a row?
[118:32.14]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[118:34.16]There's not 10 rounds in that gun.
[118:37.59]What?
[118:40.79]I'll get him.
[118:41.17]Ready?
[118:46.19]Well, I got him.
[118:46.95]I just didn't get him.
[118:47.57]No.
[118:47.83]No, forget it.
[118:51.36]Fuck it.
[118:51.58]I don't care.
[118:53.30]He's going to come back around and I'm going to get him.
[118:56.72]I'm going to die.
[118:57.88]Is he dead?
[118:58.96]Don't tell me he's dead.
[118:59.68]Did I kill him?
[119:02.68]He's dead.
[119:05.06]What are you doing?
[119:09.60]Why did you do that?
[119:11.16]That was absolutely the thing you weren't supposed to do.
[119:15.88]I was right there.
[119:16.87]The kill was secured.
[119:21.09]You had it down.
[119:21.89]You had it patented.
[119:22.89]You didn't have to do any of those things that you did.
[119:31.63]What was that?
[119:35.32]What is going on right now?
[119:40.68]I'm so confused.
[119:43.50]I need the... I have to use this.
[119:47.06]This is the only place I can go, right?
[119:54.07]And this is gonna be the alien guy.
[119:55.21]He's gonna be here.
[119:55.67]The fucking alien's gonna be behind this door and I'm gonna die.
[120:00.59]Wait for the dust to settle.
[120:01.87]There's nothing in here.
[120:08.75]Get in there.
[120:15.21]Here's the goal.
[120:15.75]Make it to the healing box.
[120:19.05]That's the only thing I have to do.
[120:20.66]Just get to the healing box and open healing box and use healing item.
[120:25.88]Mission accomplished.
[120:26.84]Save game.
[120:30.64]Is there a guy hiding in here?
[120:32.48]You know that's going to happen at some point during this, right?
[120:34.95]Crowbar.
[120:37.81]Easy enough.
[120:39.07]It's right here.
[120:42.75]All that to just get a shotgun.
[120:46.05]Four bullets.
[120:48.17]Dead bird.
[120:53.44]There he goes.
[120:55.24]Down to the parking garage.
[121:01.43]We're gonna get introduced.
[121:02.25]Do I seriously?
[121:03.91]Oh my god.
[121:04.59]Huh?
[121:08.93]Took his hat off too.
[121:10.31]That's how much I killed that guy.
[121:13.35]Is this guy peeing?
[121:20.06]What the fuck were you guys doing?
[121:23.06]You were looking in the wrong direction.
[121:27.32]Well.
[121:29.26]How many are in here?
[121:30.06]Two?
[121:31.86]What about this one?
[121:34.32]This one has five.
[121:40.16]Carry on.
[121:41.86]Nothing to see here.
[121:42.58]Yeah, I'm going to slow down.
[121:51.55]Honestly, those guys weren't even drug addicts.
[121:52.97]I think those guys were just waiting for a train.
[121:56.33]And they didn't read the news.
[121:59.31]What is that noise?
[122:03.82]Dead bird.
[122:07.51]Pick it up.
[122:13.13]Uh, we gotta flip this so I can... I still don't understand the purpose of those.
[122:18.35]Get full health.
[122:25.67]Okay, that just scared the absolute shit out of me.
[122:28.85]It's a very loud... Why did I do that?
[122:35.86]That was so dumb.
[122:36.88]That was so stupid.
[122:38.80]I didn't have to do that.
[122:39.90]I didn't need to shoot him.
[122:47.99]That wouldn't happen.
[122:55.43]This wasn't just happening down here.
[122:58.35]Why is this happening down here?
[123:04.13]Why would you throw the weapon down?
[123:05.91]Hey!
[123:08.63]Oh, god damn it.
[123:09.41]Why would you put the weapon down?
[123:10.79]He's hiding right... Get out of here.
[123:17.18]Punch.
[123:18.50]At least we got a sign.
[123:24.76]Oh, shit.
[123:25.20]Somebody's coming down here with a weapon to try to kill me.
[123:28.23]I'm gonna drop the weapon and let's go.
[123:30.67]No, you're not gonna get a hand-to-hand fight here.
[123:35.37]We're in post-apocalyptic, everyone's a drug addict.
[123:38.21]You think I'm going to put down my sign?
[123:40.29]No.
[123:41.37]That is not going to happen.
[123:43.91]You think I'm going to throw my gun down?
[123:46.71]And honor fight you?
[123:50.77]No.
[123:53.47]Which way?
[123:53.91]This way?
[123:58.39]I think carrying the sign is heavier, so I get less stamina back.
[124:11.52]There he is.
[124:15.09]One more.
[124:15.45]Two more dead birds.
[124:17.21]I wish I had a gun.
[124:18.69]I could end this right now if I got a perfectly timed headshot.
[124:25.89]Alas, I don't think that's going to be a reality.
[124:27.91]There he is.
[124:31.15]What?
[124:32.72]Climb aboard the train.
[124:34.10]How do I do that?
[124:34.68]How do I get in the train?
[124:35.82]Oh, God.
[124:37.46]Get in the train.
[124:40.76]How do I get up?
[124:48.86]No, I want the sign.
[124:50.66]I want my sign back.
[124:52.06]Where's the sign?
[124:56.08]It's starting to go pretty fast.
[124:59.51]What happens if I don't go in?
[125:02.01]Let's find out.
[125:08.23]I don't think I do go in.
[125:12.45]I don't hear any train sounds, by the way.
[125:17.86]What is going on?
[125:32.35]I think I really just think I'm supposed to stand here.
[125:39.03]Unless I'm missing something completely and there's something I didn't do.
[125:41.75]I think I'm just on a never-ending train.
[125:47.51]Oh, there's a guy there.
[125:48.77]Two guys, in fact.
[125:59.63]What is happening right now?
[126:08.25]That guy got wrecked.
[126:11.07]That's why you look both ways, man.
[126:12.99]If I'm on the side of that train, you're looking left and right to make sure that doesn't happen.
[126:18.15]That guy got sandwiched.
[126:19.67]He's coming over here.
[126:22.37]This is so much less dramatic without audio.
[126:41.69]I win!
[126:45.53]Uh, favorite weapon pump shock?
[126:46.71]I felt like there was supposed to be dialog there.
[126:49.23]Was there supposed to be people talking?
[126:50.51]The game may have broke at that point, who knows.
[126:57.95]All I was hearing was lights flickering and flashing.
[127:01.71]And then that guy getting crushed, which was perfect.
[127:08.49]Well, that was still fun.
[127:11.79]The suspect's train must stop at the next platform.
[127:13.67]Make your way there.
[127:18.55]We got the smell-o-vision.
[127:23.46]Gotta track the source of the smell-o-vision.
[127:28.90]Something stinks down here.
[127:29.84]There it is.
[127:33.54]Something stinks.
[127:37.63]Birds collected one of five.
[127:41.48]There's a fight going on.
[127:42.28]I don't have a weapon.
[127:43.08]I need to get something quick.
[127:47.45]I'm always just too little too late with this guy.
[127:50.29]He seems to be clearing a path for me everywhere I go.
[127:54.05]Another fucking mutant.
[127:59.81]Got it.
[128:02.43]Oh lord.
[128:03.67]Are you trying to tell me that trains come down here?
[128:08.23]Electrified puddles are deadly.
[128:12.08]But walk around it.
[128:14.23]So walk around.
[128:14.99]Why can't I walk any further?
[128:18.27]Okay.
[128:20.03]Looks like I'm going over here.
[128:21.51]There's an invisible wall preventing you from getting hit by a train.
[128:30.27]Tight corridors, my ass.
[128:32.21]Holy God.
[128:33.01]Okay, that's one of the freaks.
[128:34.18]One of the new freaks.
[128:45.63]That guy was terrifying.
[128:52.65]Shotgun.
[128:53.21]How many bullets are in here?
[128:55.14]Five.
[128:55.48]Good.
[128:56.98]That's gravy.
[128:57.84]I'll take it.
[129:03.42]Get out of there.
[129:07.45]Make sure I didn't miss anything.
[129:08.47]I need health.
[129:10.75]Nothing down there.
[129:11.65]It's just a pipe.
[129:19.14]That made a lot of noise.
[129:20.62]Noise I'm not sure I wanted to make.
[129:36.93]These little like mole people.
[129:39.79]Why would you hide there?
[129:40.77]That guy took so much time to make sure that was a perfect hiding spot.
[129:47.43]He piled so- Somebody had to help him do that.
[129:50.23]You don't do that by yourself.
[129:52.23]He had like four friends put that shit all over him.
[129:57.91]A for effort.
[130:00.85]F for execution.
[130:06.73]Save point.
[130:14.52]Ah, this is where the light- Ah!
[130:16.36]That guy was skating.
[130:18.41]He was glitching on the ground, sliding forward.
[130:24.39]I don't like this part!
[130:27.83]I missed him.
[130:28.71]He's pretending... I did that because there's no way I hit him.
[130:32.63]He was pretending to be dead.
[130:36.61]I'm certain of that.
[130:42.88]I shot way over that guy's head.
[130:44.56]The noise killed him.
[130:46.82]See what I'm talking about?
[130:52.55]They instantly die?
[130:54.81]Even from electricity.
[130:55.67]That's good to know.
[131:04.69]It's that easy.
[131:05.91]It's that easy.
[131:06.55]Just gotta make sure it's charged.
[131:08.27]Woo!
[131:10.85]Fuck.
[131:11.39]They're just everywhere.
[131:12.49]Who the fuck are you?
[131:16.85]Come on.
[131:18.27]What is this guy doing?
[131:24.20]Is this guy planting C4?
[131:25.56]I have no idea.
[131:29.21]I've got to be careful, though, because I'm going to die if I'm not careful.
[131:33.97]Metal piece.
[131:35.95]Where?
[131:37.09]Where is he?
[131:37.47]Where is he?
[131:38.77]Where is he?
[131:39.73]He's up top.
[131:41.19]Alright, long shot for the win.
[131:47.07]Got him.
[131:56.36]What the hell is he doing?
[131:58.40]Is he looting this body?
[132:00.98]I think he is.
[132:02.84]Oh wow, an unsuspecting corpse.
[132:04.68]Thanks.
[132:06.28]Imagine that landed on his head.
[132:08.02]That would have been a perfect spot to die.
[132:10.59]Alright, so where the... How do I get up there?
[132:16.97]Can I climb anything over here?
[132:22.29]Hey, let me in.
[132:25.93]This guy's just pantomiming.
[132:26.99]Whatever.
[132:27.25]I think I have to go back.
[132:35.63]Because that guy was up top.
[132:37.08]I feel like I have to be up there.
[132:39.58]Somehow.
[132:45.52]Hi.
[132:48.50]He's wrapping around.
[132:49.16]Yes, he is.
[132:51.35]Their AI is not totally brainless.
[132:53.81]It's not.
[133:00.29]He knows where I am.
[133:03.19]And I don't know where he is.
[133:05.55]That is the quintessential horror experience.
[133:08.73]I don't know where you are, but you know where I am.
[133:12.20]That's how you scare all your friends when you play Friday the 13th, Dead by Daylight.
[133:15.56]I need a fucking shovel.
[133:26.30]You guys ever played Dead by Daylight?
[133:29.34]Super scary, man.
[133:31.38]It's so fucked up.
[133:34.95]It's so scary.
[133:35.53]It's so fucked up.
[133:37.67]I just love when games are fucking fucked up.
[133:42.35]Waiting for one of those rat people to crawl down here.
[133:51.14]Nothing?
[133:53.22]Oh, for the record, I've never played one second of Dead by Daylight.
[133:56.42]I don't own it.
[133:57.46]I never played it.
[134:02.08]I played Friday the $14 game.
[134:05.42]That is magically $60.
[134:06.24]I've played that one before.
[134:09.92]That one was fun.
[134:11.60]But it's a $14 game and you pay like $45 in licensing fees to play as Jason.
[134:20.55]Pretty interesting stuff.
[134:23.75]Alright, let's go.
[134:36.17]Friday the 14th.
[134:36.87]That one's going to grab me here.
[134:40.85]No.
[134:41.43]I haven't seen a health pack in a while.
[134:46.17]It's sort of concerning.
[134:48.92]In a way.
[134:49.30]Let's go over here first.
[134:56.26]Up top.
[135:01.07]We're finally going to get a chance to see what this guy's doing.
[135:09.37]We can go this way.
[135:10.33]Can you throw shit in this game?
[135:13.71]Can I do a drop-down kill?
[135:16.42]I'm going to try it.
[135:19.12]Let's try a drop-down Shadow of War kill.
[135:22.38]Or a Dark Souls kill.
[135:33.92]Well, that didn't work.
[135:36.38]And he's gone anyways.
[135:37.16]Well, that was very anticlimactic.
[135:42.79]I apologize.
[135:43.47]And I can't seem to jump down.
[135:47.45]There.
[135:54.10]My shovel is too big to fit through there.
[135:56.76]God, here we go.
[136:05.44]Dead bird?
[136:05.94]No.
[136:07.64]Concrete!
[136:10.94]That sounds pretty good.
[136:18.35]Train.
[136:19.91]Alright, game saved.
[136:21.33]We're on the right path.
[136:23.03]Can I pick this up?
[136:25.07]That's too bad, I can't pick up a fucking huge door.
[136:31.55]Don't think it's this way.
[136:37.25]Yeah, my big roasted marshmallow.
[136:39.78]Where's the campfire when you need one?
[136:44.14]Make myself some roasted toasted shrooms.
[136:47.24]Shroomellows.
[136:47.92]Marshmallows.
[136:48.70]Marshmallows.
[136:55.22]Could you cook mushrooms on a fire?
[136:57.26]If you really wanted to.
[137:03.60]I feel like you probably could.
[137:06.45]This is where he was.
[137:08.93]Search for some search.
[137:10.07]Isn't that what I'm trying to do?
[137:15.42]Uh, yes.
[137:18.64]Investigate.
[137:22.58]Looking for this guy's fingerprints.
[137:27.88]Organic evidence shows a bright purple.
[137:32.52]Looking for blood.
[137:36.00]There it is.
[137:41.54]Further in?
[137:46.61]Not like any of this matters.
[137:47.79]Why would this... Analyzing the fingerprints.
[137:50.09]I don't understand this.
[138:00.45]considering that how many times have I sent her fingerprints and she still can't see them or read them?
[138:13.63]Am I a side dentist?
[138:20.17]Sure, I'll keep myself busy.
[138:23.92]Hey, and Trevor, it really is great that you have all this dental equipment.
[138:36.67]Do I just sit around?
[138:37.33]Are they coming?
[138:49.27]What am I watching here?
[138:52.19]I think I'm just supposed to watch this guy kill everybody.
[138:54.23]Yep.
[138:54.95]Okay, there's one more over here.
[138:56.04]Oh!
[138:57.20]Oh my god!
[139:07.56]Oh, God damn it, man.
[139:10.40]Oh, we have to do that again.
[139:12.31]Why would you do that?
[139:13.23]There's a huge guy.
[139:14.21]I was trying to watch my movie.
[139:16.09]I just was an observer.
[139:21.99]Well, you know what?
[139:22.63]She took the opportunity.
[139:24.11]I will give her credit for that.
[139:28.23]I got two in the head.
[139:30.03]It was just... Click, clack.
[139:34.74]Instantly dead.
[139:38.52]I'm just going to get out there.
[139:43.09]Search the subway for clues.
[139:47.43]Where is it?
[139:48.53]Oh, there he is.
[139:49.69]There's his fucking chocolate handprint.
[139:54.29]Zoom in a little closer.
[139:56.22]Yeah, Trevor.
[139:57.24]It looks like he's a big fan of Charleston Chews.
[140:01.02]Let's put that in the computer and see if we get any data from it.
[140:07.97]Where did that lady come from?
[140:15.00]Did she climb?
[140:15.66]There's no way to get in.
[140:20.82]There's no way to get in.
[140:22.88]How did she get in?
[140:24.76]I'm being serious.
[140:25.70]How the fuck did that lady get in?
[140:27.66]It's not possible.
[140:49.82]Is this, when is this, when is this, is this happening?
[140:52.54]Oh, I got, goddammit, I forgot.
[140:54.36]Oh, you zoom in, now this time take it, now this time zoom in and zoom in and zoom in and zoom in.
[141:01.33]Got it!
[141:09.07]I'm really curious as to how they got in.
[141:12.19]I think I can.
[141:12.76]I'm gonna watch Friday the 13th video game on stream.
[141:17.14]There's the guy that he got in the house.
[141:18.78]He's locking the door.
[141:19.60]He's gonna go get, like, the knife that's on the table in there.
[141:23.62]There's Jason.
[141:25.78]Alright, like, I died, so, like, I can, like, observe.
[141:31.28]So, here comes, like, one of the camp counselors.
[141:33.06]Here they come.
[141:34.67]Oh, wait!
[141:35.59]We can swarm Jason!
[141:36.65]Alright, how does she get in here?
[141:39.07]How do you get in?
[141:41.73]Explain it to me.
[141:50.59]out of here.
[141:56.45]She actually opens the door.
[141:58.93]What a crock of shit.
[142:08.62]Is he still here, right?
[142:11.24]He didn't go away.
[142:14.12]This is a bad Jason player.
[142:15.80]I'm gonna use the firecrackers.
[142:23.97]See?
[142:24.37]And now we're going to break Jason's neck.
[142:30.60]Counselor's win.
[142:41.10]What did she have?
[142:44.87]Yeah, I came back as Tommy Jarvis.
[142:51.73]Can't go up here.
[142:55.76]This could use more wrestling moves.
[142:57.02]You know what?
[142:57.56]It actually could.
[143:00.44]I do agree with that.
[143:05.14]Can I open this with a sledgehammer?
[143:06.88]Yes, I can.
[143:11.11]Although it's too bad I didn't have a one single shot rifle.
[143:16.15]Are those his clothes?
[143:20.51]That would have been an A-plus joke.
[143:24.21]If I had one shot and a shotgun and got him.
[143:31.21]Is there evidence here?
[143:32.53]Where?
[143:36.24]Is that evidence?
[143:42.92]Yeah.
[143:43.12]I gotta remember the subway stops.
[143:47.17]Enhance.
[143:47.45]They actually are doing enhance.
[143:48.45]Mm-hmm.
[143:48.73]Kick out wall fan and climb through.
[143:50.49]At least you make it easy for me.
[143:52.11]That took no brain power at all.
[144:17.43]Is this just a regular stick?
[144:19.39]No?
[144:20.17]Crashing?
[144:21.05]Lightning?
[144:23.90]Do you hear that lightning strike?
[144:25.94]It means somebody's close.
[144:31.74]Can't get in there.
[144:32.32]I need a fire axe.
[144:33.64]Oh, shoot.
[144:43.92]Uh-huh.
[144:44.66]Med kit.
[144:45.82]Don't really need it, but I'll take it anyways because don't waste it.
[144:51.76]Part of me wishes I could Incredible Hulk and rip off one of these giant pipes.
[145:00.37]This is a get back up.
[145:01.11]I didn't even need to do that.
[145:01.91]There's a door here.
[145:04.21]I just closed myself out?
[145:05.27]Why?
[145:13.57]Is Condemn 2 on PC?
[145:16.97]It might be.
[145:18.45]I don't know.
[145:21.19]Last time I checked, I have it for PS3.
[145:27.59]Somebody took the fire axe.
[145:29.81]That's not fair.
[145:31.81]I need that.
[145:38.07]Find Valve and turn off Steam.
[145:47.50]I guess it's up here.
[145:48.34]I need the fire axe.
[145:55.58]Can I get that fire axe?
[146:00.10]The fire axe is in the wall over there.
[146:02.18]Can I... This is going to hurt me.
[146:05.63]Oh, okay.
[146:06.23]I thought it was going to burn me.
[146:09.97]Are you guys making like a Steam Valve joke?
[146:13.36]I missed it.
[146:14.80]Thomas speaking.
[146:16.08]Greybeard.
[146:16.36]The document is a standard safety train schedule.
[146:19.70]Pressure has been applied for the silence of only two scheduled routes.
[146:22.83]Hey guys, it's me, Dave, and Noah.
[146:23.93]Hope you guys are happy with the latest software updates we have for Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.
[146:28.55]And also, the newest card game from Dota.
[146:38.35]Hope you like it!
[146:40.27]Hope you like it, folks!
[146:43.05]Cause that's all you're gonna get for the next ten years!
[146:50.02]I'm Bane now!
[146:51.52]It's me, Gabe Newell, I'm fucking Bane!
[146:54.80]The matchmaker, at least I think so.
[146:57.90]Something's still not adding up.
[147:11.79]Guys, if you want to do voices, just speak.
[147:15.05]Don't give a chance.
[147:15.69]That's all it takes.
[147:21.14]That's all it takes, ladies and gentlemen.
[147:23.38]Ladies and gentlemen.
[147:25.38]Get in there with you where you belong.
[147:27.10]Look at this rigor mortis.
[147:29.86]You died a long time ago.
[147:31.12]Why do you have rigor mortis now?
[147:34.83]I gotta, like, fucking golf putt this guy in the hole.
[147:36.93]Hold on.
[147:40.70]Come on.
[147:41.24]What stroke am I at?
[147:43.44]I feel like I'm playing mini golf.
[147:45.54]You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
[147:47.06]You're the guy, when you go play mini golf, that misses five times this putt and you just slide it in.
[147:54.38]You just sweep it in because you're so aggravated.
[148:00.40]Get the fuck in there.
[148:02.52]And now he's stuck.
[148:03.14]God damn it.
[148:04.14]Get in there!
[148:05.98]Get the fuck in there.
[148:07.39]I'm not gonna stop till this is done.
[148:08.83]Oh, god damn it.
[148:09.53]This is like touching my OCD.
[148:13.15]I gotta move.
[148:14.09]Run.
[148:14.79]Run.
[148:16.93]Run.
[148:23.23]Run.
[148:27.13]I saw that horror movie compilation where they played that song and people got scared.
[148:34.67]I've got to turn off the steam down here.
[148:51.55]Hold on.
[149:02.64]Give me a second.
[149:06.44]This'll be worth it.
[149:07.16]You guys have been, like, waiting for this shit.
[149:18.63]Everybody, like, has been waiting for this.
[149:24.49]You guys are gonna think it's hilarious.
[149:25.64]Trust me.
[149:30.74]Uh-oh.
[149:31.02]Okay.
[149:36.90]And here we go.
[149:42.20]And... Shut up.
[150:09.85]Did you see how fucking funny that was?
[150:27.82]I'm sorry.
[150:28.46]That was a low effort.
[150:29.18]That was a low effort.
[150:40.16]for me nice dodge I suck at I suck at this this guy is pretending to be a ninja somebody is shooting a gun who has a gun oh my god how did my Steam crash oh how far away was that oh me was it that far away wait that guy spawns right here
[151:09.50]Oh my god, fucking god damn it.
[151:15.20]All because I had to... Oh, I had to load up like a shitty YouTube video of Gabe Newell talking.
[151:20.38]No, fuck me.
[151:21.32]God damn it, man.
[151:22.48]How do I skip this?
[151:27.66]I deserve this.
[151:28.24]I deserve it, I do.
[151:47.05]This is his hub, so he goes to both locations regularly.
[151:49.83]I'm so sorry we have to do this.
[151:50.99]I've also determined DNA from the sweat sample in the tray matches DNA from the cigarette pot.
[151:55.95]99.8% probability.
[151:57.47]The guy you're following is the guy who healed the two policemen.
[152:00.72]I can't skip it.
[152:02.40]The matchmaker.
[152:03.36]At least, I think so.
[152:05.50]Something's still not adding up.
[152:08.40]Okay, save that to make sure.
[152:09.64]No, not F9.
[152:10.26]No!
[152:11.89]It's F5.
[152:13.93]God.
[152:15.37]Calm down.
[152:18.02]much of my hard drive is screenshots?
[152:19.70]Probably a large percentage.
[152:21.00]Remember this?
[152:28.79]Hole in one.
[152:29.49]Got it.
[152:29.77]You don't even need to make the joke.
[152:31.99]You already know what the joke was.
[152:33.07]Joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, joke.
[152:43.40]Okay.
[152:43.84]Back to reality.
[152:47.96]Turned it off.
[152:48.98]I turned it.
[152:49.74]Heck, I turned it.
[152:57.30]Here we go.
[152:57.86]Here he is.
[152:58.58]And this is where I chased him last time this happened.
[153:01.94]He went downstairs.
[153:05.45]And then somebody with a gun was there.
[153:06.83]Where's the guy with the gun?
[153:15.38]You are bad!
[153:17.74]You are bad.
[153:18.74]You know, I'm gonna let you get up and get the gun.
[153:22.63]No, I'm not.
[153:24.93]He had it right in my face.
[153:27.17]Pull the trigger, man.
[153:34.09]You know, I'm gonna make a PUBG joke because it's relevant.
[153:36.33]Like, PUBG is a relevant video game on Twitch and everybody loves it.
[153:39.03]And it's like the most popular game in the world.
[153:42.33]This just is the first 30 seconds of every single PUBG match if you land at, like, school.
[153:49.03]It just is.
[153:49.81]That's what happens.
[153:51.35]Some guy with a psycho with a frying pan is, like, trying to swing at you because there was no weapon on the ground.
[153:55.61]And that guy that has the one pistol turns the corner and tries to shoot you.
[154:01.82]This is just where they... That's the whole game.
[154:04.30]The first, like, two minutes of every single game.
[154:07.74]I don't even... Look, I have to stay relevant.
[154:09.26]You understand?
[154:09.60]I have to stay relevant with these jokes.
[154:13.73]PUBG has like 700,000 concurrent viewers right now.
[154:17.59]I need to be relevant.
[154:18.53]People on twitch.tv need to know that I'm fucking relevant with this stuff.
[154:24.27]What if I don't make that reference?
[154:26.83]I'd lose respect.
[154:32.98]It's hard times.
[154:34.18]We get it.
[154:42.13]Some people at this stream right now, maybe this is the first time they've ever seen this stream.
[154:47.39]It's possible.
[154:48.15]And maybe they're a huge PUBG fan.
[154:50.01]Guess what?
[154:50.75]They now think I'm way cooler.
[154:53.21]Because they're like, holy, yeah, that's true.
[154:56.23]Alright.
[154:57.17]Fist bump.
[154:59.15]And they're going to follow the stream.
[155:01.17]And I'm never going to play their favorite game.
[155:03.63]And then they'll unfollow after a week after they understand that I'm not going to play PUBG.
[155:08.88]That's what's going to happen.
[155:10.24]But at least I made them smile.
[155:16.08]What am I doing?
[155:23.46]What about the respect of us, the people that love you?
[155:25.96]But I know that.
[155:26.58]I already know that.
[155:29.92]I know you guys respect me.
[155:31.81]I know you guys respect me.
[155:33.99]I'm going to open the floodgates here.
[155:39.78]What is PUBG?
[155:40.57]Is that a new Pokémon?
[155:46.03]Alright, you just... You gave... You showed your... You shot me!
[155:51.17]Why did you shoot me?
[155:55.79]I can wait.
[155:58.68]I'm not going to turn a corner and get hit in the head.
[156:05.02]Come on.
[156:07.05]He might be bleeding out.
[156:08.45]Nope.
[156:09.03]Don't think so, buddy.
[156:17.97]PUBG.
[156:22.10]Okay, I might... I think I have to... Is there anything down here I can use to break that?
[156:25.56]I mean, this weirdo is over here, but nothing else.
[156:32.52]I'm getting lost.
[156:38.26]I think I'm getting lost in a bad way.
[156:42.40]No, we're good.
[156:44.70]Find the smell.
[156:48.25]Where's the smell?
[156:49.17]There it is.
[157:01.83]Elaborate device.
[157:05.19]No, look, there's nothing wrong with PUBG.
[157:08.05]Nothing wrong with those Battle Royale games.
[157:10.31]They're interesting.
[157:11.15]Look, they're fun.
[157:11.85]I think they're cool.
[157:19.08]You missed your Q. Whee!
[157:27.70]Pat myself on the back on that one.
[157:31.48]anymore.
[157:32.22]There's another one.
[157:33.40]Where is he?
[157:34.08]Huh?
[157:34.60]What the fuck is happening?
[157:35.46]Why is it dark?
[157:41.60]He like turned the lights off.
[157:49.81]Give me this pipe.
[157:53.67]That guy hit me so hard and it turned off my flashlight.
[158:03.43]Anything else in the bottom here?
[158:06.23]Why do I love shitty games?
[158:07.39]This is not a shitty game.
[158:08.39]This is a great game.
[158:11.90]You're not going to say... Come on.
[158:12.82]You can't actually... This is a shitty game.
[158:16.80]Condemned and Condemned 2 are classics.
[158:20.02]They're not even that old.
[158:26.07]That's like saying, like, Fallout 3 is a bad game.
[158:29.24]Well, it is, but that's like somebody else said.
[158:31.72]That's like me saying it.
[158:34.22]Somebody else needs to say that.
[158:35.88]That's a bad example.
[158:46.31]Uh-oh, it's another Jason!
[158:52.96]Okay, here we go.
[158:53.60]I'm gonna try to flush him down the hole.
[158:55.82]Think I can do it?
[158:57.70]Place your bets.
[159:00.60]That guy just wanted me to know he was here.
[159:05.95]There's two!
[159:07.15]There's two!
[159:08.31]He did like the Naruto spell and turned into two guys.
[159:13.41]I'm not okay with this.
[159:14.97]Not at all.
[159:15.95]I have no stamina.
[159:18.31]Does this hurt somebody?
[159:18.95]Where's the other one?
[159:24.62]Okay, I can't fuck around.
[159:29.12]I could have stole that.
[159:34.06]The other one is still looking for me, which is a good thing.
[159:36.63]Alright, can I flush him?
[159:38.19]No, get over here, you stupid ass.
[159:40.29]Alright, when I get him around, when he goes around his path.
[159:47.21]These guys are both fucking idiots, huh?
[159:51.31]Not the brightest bulbs in the game.
[159:59.36]And they're both gone.
[160:10.20]He's like, hey, quit it!
[160:11.32]It's like a sibling rivalry.
[160:14.05]Okay.
[160:20.21]Oh, god damn it.
[160:20.95]No, I want to... Let's break his neck.
[160:32.62]There he is.
[160:33.10]You think you can hide from me?
[160:35.04]You idiot.
[160:36.92]You're doing a fairly decent job of hiding, but not... Look, see?
[160:39.70]I can see you.
[160:43.02]He still fucking got me.
[160:44.16]And I knew it was gonna happen.
[160:54.73]It's just too slow.
[161:01.97]Those guys were effectively in the back of a car going on a long road trip.
[161:09.74]Mom, he keeps putting his hand on my side!
[161:14.57]He keeps barely not touching me, putting his hand in my face.
[161:19.52]Quiet down, you little shit.
[161:22.72]Daddy's smoking.
[161:24.30]How did interactions work back in the 1940s or 50s?
[161:30.64]Trying to enjoy my cigar.
[161:33.14]Quiet back there.
[161:34.18]There we go.
[161:45.57]Nice.
[161:46.34]Health kit.
[161:49.38]Shovel and Deborah.
[161:50.20]I'm going to take this because it's pretty obvious that I need a shovel because everybody has one.
[161:56.10]I need to break something probably.
[161:58.02]Probably.
[162:00.97]And over here.
[162:03.45]Jump down.
[162:06.07]They didn't have cars back then?
[162:07.21]Yes, they did.
[162:08.85]Are you telling me they didn't have cars back in the 1940s?
[162:14.03]Were they still doing horse and buggy in the 40s?
[162:16.75]The Model T... I knew it was gonna happen.
[162:23.92]I knew it was gonna happen.
[162:25.42]I told you guys.
[162:26.96]I got so scared I couldn't even make a noise.
[162:33.54]That was true fear.
[162:35.50]That was like a blink and... I knew that was gonna happen.
[162:40.27]I don't... I want the shovel.
[162:48.70]Condemned.
[162:52.76]Condemned them.
[162:54.15]Alien on the roof.
[162:55.99]Alien on the roof.
[162:57.11]Wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo.
[162:58.63]Alien on the roof.
[163:00.51]Call the fire department.
[163:01.55]Call the police.
[163:02.17]Call the coroner.
[163:04.59]Bag him up.
[163:06.89]Bag him up.
[163:12.66]Mm-hmm.
[163:15.12]Take him down.
[163:16.16]Put him in the bag.
[163:17.04]Bring him to the morgue.
[163:20.37]Bring him to the morgue.
[163:22.37]Bag him up.
[163:22.97]Tag him up.
[163:29.77]Shotgun or shotgun?
[163:31.91]Neither.
[163:32.43]Oh, neither.
[163:33.62]What part of the country are you from?
[163:35.56]What part of the world are you from?
[163:36.88]How do you say it?
[163:46.32]God damn it.
[163:52.80]Oh my god, am I going the right way?
[163:54.20]How many of these do I have to turn off?
[164:00.42]Do I have to turn any of these off?
[164:08.83]I've lost my mind.
[164:14.07]I have lost my mind.
[164:14.99]I lost my mind like 16 years ago.
[164:18.86]There it is.
[164:19.34]The thing that you need the shovel to break.
[164:22.29]What's that?
[164:23.11]Oh, nothing.
[164:27.84]You have two midterms tomorrow, and Jerma is my... Did I just cause a fire by swinging this?
[164:32.82]What?
[164:34.24]Oh, come on.
[164:36.42]That's not how you cause a fire.
[164:38.28]Ah!
[164:41.68]Now I have to turn all the valves, the thing that I just was doing.
[164:46.07]Ah, Wii U. God damn it, Wii U.
[164:50.78]The thing that I just got done asking if I had to do is this.
[165:01.79]Where did you come from?
[165:06.87]Here comes another one.
[165:07.85]Wow.
[165:09.43]You just shook the whole Earth with your jump.
[165:12.21]I got to be prepared for this.
[165:13.01]I got to be prepared for her.
[165:13.86]Come on.
[165:18.12]And here comes another one!
[165:22.06]Nice parry.
[165:25.08]Oh my god.
[165:25.84]I almost just got parried.
[165:27.86]There's another one.
[165:28.96]Again!
[165:34.84]And snap neck.
[165:36.42]No, this time we're gonna... We're gonna slam.
[165:47.95]Another one?
[165:48.61]No, there's one more I have to do.
[165:49.63]I got something in my eye.
[165:51.73]God damn it.
[165:54.23]Melee better than chivalry.
[165:57.66]You know, as much of a joke as, you know, I know you're saying that it's kind of just like, oh, a joke.
[166:03.14]Melee in this game is actually very fun.
[166:05.88]It feels... What happened to the audio?
[166:11.45]Somebody just pulled that on a string.
[166:13.93]There was no explosion.
[166:24.26]But yes, the melee is very fun.
[166:27.28]It's very engaging.
[166:29.47]It's full of life.
[166:33.73]Exactly what I'm looking for when I'm looking for a first-person melee experience.
[166:44.69]What was my major?
[166:45.69]In college, it was marine biology.
[166:48.59]With a minor in nuclear physics.
[167:03.18]Anybody in this door?
[167:12.23]Can I get my audio back?
[167:14.09]I miss it.
[167:22.29]This is a bunch of cockroaches.
[167:24.74]You turned the lights on.
[167:26.50]You scared the cockroaches away.
[167:37.28]How many bolts?
[167:40.66]One?
[167:41.86]No, no, no.
[167:42.28]I know.
[167:42.48]We're both going for the gun like a movie.
[167:52.89]Oh, shit.
[167:53.31]She got the gun.
[167:57.41]You see the guy that jumped?
[168:08.35]The guy that jumped off the train in the mid-air and got shot was perfect.
[168:16.05]That guy tried his hardest.
[168:19.05]Didn't do a damn thing.
[168:22.00]That guy accidentally killed a lot of people for me.
[168:33.00]Investigate the area for clues.
[168:34.55]Okay.
[168:37.30]One more dead bird and we got them all.
[168:41.13]I thought it said grab coconut is what I thought that just said.
[168:50.45]Oh, look for clues.
[168:51.91]This is a clue right here.
[168:54.51]The thing with the giant circle on it.
[169:01.61]Level up my bird skill.
[169:04.29]Yeah, this game is a four out of five birds.
[169:06.65]When did this game actually come out?
[169:08.07]Okay.
[169:08.19]You mean this?
[169:09.32]I'm going to shoot the red circle.
[169:11.12]Okay, duh.
[169:13.46]Which way did it go?
[169:33.88]Okay, boss.
[169:36.87]That's a red circle.
[169:40.83]What if I send a picture of my, like, penis?
[169:44.27]Hey, zoom in on that red circle.
[169:46.87]Oh, God.
[169:47.45]What the fuck did you just send me?
[169:48.83]I'm sorry.
[169:49.57]I don't know.
[169:50.03]I can't help it.
[169:50.85]Okay.
[170:03.76]Did I live in a dorm?
[170:04.58]I did.
[170:07.00]I did live in a dorm in college.
[170:08.04]Alright, I need to break into the subway train.
[170:12.92]Did they mean this one?
[170:17.64]Or do they mean, like, please move on to the next area.
[170:20.68]You've done everything you can here.
[170:23.18]Might be what they mean.
[170:23.98]I think that's what they mean.
[170:26.90]Yes, it is.
[170:31.57]I just became prop hunt.
[170:33.39]I just became a wrench on the shelf.
[170:45.74]Or that was the movies.
[170:53.29]Ready.
[170:53.55]Ready.
[170:56.27]Found it.
[171:03.82]dust on the end of the crowbar is a common plaster mix pigmentation particles mixed in with the dust are of a soft pinkish hue apartment store dummies you got it my arm in there alright anything else you want me to do in here so should I like be using this or am I tampering with evidence
[171:37.29]What was the point of that?
[171:39.71]Nothing in here mattered.
[171:40.99]I don't understand.
[171:47.72]Underneath?
[171:48.12]I have to touch this stuff?
[171:52.04]I don't think there's anything else I do in here.
[171:53.30]Okay.
[171:56.56]Well, that was fun.
[172:00.55]I made it.
[172:11.77]That guy's got a plank.
[172:25.79]And just kill him.
[172:27.70]Nothing I can do.
[172:28.92]I knocked his glasses off.
[172:31.92]I think this just pulled up to the station.
[172:33.94]Did it?
[172:39.50]What, my reaction?
[172:40.52]The duh?
[172:42.83]Yeah, it was a pretty hard duck.
[172:47.12]I will agree.
[172:51.16]So, what?
[172:51.82]I was supposed to go into one of these?
[172:55.72]Confused on the semantics there.
[172:57.59]Train number eight?
[172:59.61]Search lower train tunnels for information linked to suspect.
[173:02.57]Looks like it's down here.
[173:08.48]Break in with the crowbar.
[173:15.18]More evidence.
[173:16.61]More... More bad guys putting their hands all over stuff with messy hands.
[173:26.57]Our perpetrator is a four-year-old child.
[173:31.07]Judging by the finger paint that's everywhere.
[173:37.33]Oh, a shoe print.
[173:51.77]Big boy.
[173:52.87]Big boy footprint.
[173:54.09]Schmutz.
[173:54.43]Here we go again.
[173:54.87]Size 14, that is pretty huge.
[174:17.35]Open ceiling compartment in subway car and look for clues.
[174:20.89]Watch out for the person that's going to be behind you, though.
[174:29.54]Maybe it's the other one.
[174:37.02]Open ceiling compartment.
[174:38.22]Where... It's... Okay.
[174:46.15]Put that there.
[174:51.55]Some really fucking creepy psycho.
[174:54.93]Why did I take that out?
[175:03.10]Where is it?
[175:06.80]Oh, is it that?
[175:08.30]Bartz?
[175:11.56]Bartz.
[175:14.68]Okay.
[175:17.19]Eat paint.
[175:17.81]What do you mean eat paint?
[175:19.23]Why is everyone saying eat paint?
[175:21.27]Eat pant?
[175:21.69]Eat pant?
[175:21.97]What are you guys talking about?
[175:47.75]Eat?
[175:47.99]Pant?
[175:48.59]Eat?
[175:48.79]Oh, it's a meme.
[175:49.86]Oh.
[175:49.94]Thomas, Route 16 to Burnside.
[175:54.46]That train will take you directly to the department store.
[175:58.70]If I hurry, I'll just make it.
[176:18.06]Make your way back to the platform.
[176:24.67]Well.
[176:26.73]Um... There's one passenger that wanted to join, but he didn't.
[176:33.03]So let's go.
[176:33.93]Start the train, man.
[176:36.08]Get it going.
[176:43.66]Turn this train on.
[176:51.36]The king of the fakeout.
[176:54.31]Okay.
[176:55.41]Is this another player?
[176:56.51]Because you're doing much better.
[176:58.83]Just kick him off.
[177:01.01]Where'd she go?
[177:04.09]Did you see that?
[177:04.47]There was another person.
[177:05.67]Where'd that other person go?
[177:15.32]I'm not crazy, right?
[177:16.06]There was another enemy here.
[177:21.53]Go up the stairs?
[177:28.77]They had to have gone up the stairs.
[177:29.81]Consume pants.
[177:39.84]Goddamn memes.
[177:44.12]Found you.
[177:49.49]Why are you so much better than me at this game?
[177:54.06]God damn it.
[177:54.88]When was the last time I had so much overconfidence and I cuuuud?
[178:02.34]No, I don't want to do this fucking choose your own detective adventure kit.
[178:15.21]Open, open the door.
[178:16.31]I know that, look, I know the guy's like creepy compartment is... Where is it?
[178:25.59]How far back was this?
[178:26.67]The footprint on the stupid... Call of Duty comes out in one and a half hours?
[178:35.19]I hope it's a fucking flop.
[178:42.30]Big boy footprint again.
[178:43.66]Call of Duty World War 2.
[178:44.60]I made like a series of tweets about this and everybody thought I was like a psycho.
[178:49.05]Back to World War 2.
[179:14.96]Like at some point... I'm trying to... Don't take that out.
[179:19.06]Put it back.
[179:26.15]It's clearly Bartz.
[179:27.31]Oh, come on.
[179:28.93]I have to be like... That's clearly... I have it in view.
[179:34.16]It was correct.
[179:48.52]okay anyways I need to save this now um history of the world stops the match
[180:07.80]No other conflict has ever existed.
[180:09.46]Remember, everybody.
[180:33.46]It's either advanced mech suit bullshit or World War II.
[180:38.52]That's every first person shooter.
[180:42.56]You have to have like a visor.
[180:43.42]Or World War II.
[180:44.12]Whiz.
[180:44.27]Whiz like the Wild West Call of Duty.
[180:46.03]Hold on.
[180:46.35]Shut up for a second.
[180:48.15]Not you.
[180:48.77]Me.
[181:06.98]Yeah, where's Call of Duty Caveman Conflict?
[181:11.43]Where's Call of Duty?
[181:18.41]See, there was a person there.
[181:19.43]I knew it.
[181:20.61]That was very far away.
[181:22.03]I refuse to believe that.
[181:23.95]We're going to catch her before she gets up there to ambush me.
[181:30.37]I want a Call of Duty game where you throw rocks at each other.
[181:35.87]Your kill streak can be like fire.
[181:38.09]Fire!
[181:40.31]And you pull up like your hand, you pull up like a leaf that's on fire and everyone gets stunned for like 10 seconds.
[181:46.99]I cannot fucking fight this person.
[182:00.60]Yeah, the 25 kill streak is like you make a wheel.
[182:15.94]Oh my god, it's chaos PUBG we just landed.
[182:27.76]Oh my god.

[183:11.63]Call of Duty Hobo Warfare.
[183:17.09]All the moves are just like scratch with fingernails or bite.
[183:36.20]And if you get four, your first killstreak is scream.
[183:43.80]It's like a flashbang.
[183:53.74]Cardboard box armor.
[183:58.20]First major cutscene of the game.
[183:59.48]It's gonna reveal the huge twist.
[184:07.48]The huge twist is...
[184:11.92]I was going to say something really dumb.
[184:13.46]I'm glad I didn't.
[184:14.24]You guys would have hated me because I would have hated myself.
[184:19.98]Who's behind me?
[184:41.20]So I just keep killing people and... So I'm just killing random people then, and I'm like a drug addict.
[184:57.13]There were supposed to be screams there.
[185:02.29]I told you I was a dentist.
[185:05.76]That was the patient that I killed in my dentist chair accidentally.
[185:10.18]I was giving him a root canal and I like slipped and stuck it into his brain.
[185:13.42]Yes.
[185:13.64]That was the horrible kill streak.
[185:15.94]What's going on?
[185:40.84]I didn't even do it.
[185:45.48]I didn't even do it.
[185:48.44]Nobody hangs up by saying, I must go.
[185:51.80]You are being tried for the death of two police officers.
[185:54.85]We're going to find you, and when we do, we will put you on trial.
[185:59.19]I must go.
[186:02.21]Alter ego for fucking Superman?
[186:03.91]What the hell are you doing?
[186:12.25]No, you end the conversation by going, bye, or we're coming for you.
[186:21.48]I must go is something you say that you hope the person on the other end thinks it's really cool that you said that.
[186:26.65]He's going to think I'm so epic and so badass if I say I must go.
[186:30.89]It's going to really tickle his brain a little, and it's going to be like, whoa, he said that.
[186:35.59]You must be cool.
[186:36.47]I thought that was an AK.
[186:39.76]Look, I really... Go back and screenshot that from like here.
[186:44.50]That was an AK-47 right there on the ground.
[186:46.42]There's the AK part.
[186:47.88]There's the 4 and there's the 7 part.
[186:56.29]Be careful.
[186:57.53]Be cautious.
[186:59.85]Merry Christmas.
[187:00.59]It's that time of year.
[187:03.31]Happy Holidays.
[187:04.45]New AK-47 right there.
[187:05.25]Look.
[187:06.41]Look.
[187:08.89]You tell me.
[187:09.35]Where's my zoom-in gun?
[187:11.01]Where's my... I heard it.
[187:16.57]You tell me that's not an AK-47 lying on the ground right there.
[187:23.84]See?
[187:28.04]Leave.
[187:30.23]Don't think so.
[187:30.77]You're not gonna fucking scare me so easily.
[187:33.65]I'm epic.
[187:36.29]I fucking hate that word.
[187:38.05]Clothes rack?
[187:40.22]Oh, I thought I could pick up the whole thing.
[187:42.06]I hate the word.
[187:45.66]I hate, like, epic.
[187:46.96]I hate it.
[187:47.72]Oh, it's one of the elves.
[188:00.45]I never get it right.
[188:01.21]I never get it right.
[188:10.14]I always block the first one and then I... He's just scaring me.
[188:14.36]Okay, that's fine.
[188:16.26]I want the speed.
[188:23.43]Epic.
[188:25.37]Can I use the door?
[188:27.19]Oh no, I can't get in there.
[188:33.24]Whatever, what do I do?
[188:41.26]No, it's not worth it.
[188:42.72]I was going to play the fucking drama music again.
[188:45.54]And do like an episode of Hoarders.
[188:48.54]But Gordon Ramsay's not in that.
[188:51.22]I just imagine that I... Okay, so just imagine the music is here.
[188:54.12]And I did like a bunch of Hoarders jokes.
[188:58.59]And Gordon Ramsay was going to be in it.
[189:02.03]The writer's room.
[189:02.69]You know, this is the writer's room.
[189:09.91]Your fucking chair is raw.
[189:12.05]Your chair is rotten.
[189:14.41]You see the bugs biting on the bottom of the chair.
[189:16.98]It's rotten.
[189:18.90]There's termites here.
[189:20.60]It's rotten.
[189:22.90]The wood.
[189:24.26]Raw.
[189:25.90]Do it again.
[189:30.72]Who's that?
[189:41.55]I don't like how much glass can break.
[189:42.93]It makes it too scary.
[189:44.25]Look at this.
[189:44.55]Look, look, look, look, look.
[189:46.15]Dead birds.
[189:46.89]Thank you.
[189:53.56]I've always wanted to do that.
[190:04.66]One of the mannequins is going to actually be a guy.
[190:07.85]I know I can already tell you right now one of these guys is gonna turn around it's gonna be a guy that's a guy this is a guy you see this look at the guy's neck I knew it but look at this is a guy this guy's doing a very good job acting he's just like painted himself what no way no that guy look at his neck this is a person look at it this is a real person

[190:52.01]Holy shit.
[190:55.79]He was doing a perfect job.
[190:57.60]That's a guy I want to hire for my next production.
[191:10.60]These guys can't be electrocuted.
[191:16.74]Alright, knock the helmet off.
[191:24.20]It's right here.
[191:25.84]Not this time.
[191:27.18]Alright, once you knock off their armor, you can kill them.
[191:36.73]No, what?
[191:37.47]Pick up... What the hell am I doing?
[191:39.03]What is he...
[191:52.46]Give me the big one.
[191:55.29]Okay, we're good.
[191:58.05]These guys are terrifying, though.
[192:00.01]They have these awful faces.
[192:07.77]That's where he was standing.
[192:13.24]There's another one.
[192:15.40]This is like business casual mannequin.
[192:18.32]He has a little button-up that it's undone.
[192:19.88]The tie is undone.
[192:22.59]He's also covered in candle wax.
[192:24.13]I hear another guy.
[192:33.85]Why?
[192:42.80]Get off me.
[192:44.92]Where'd I go?
[192:46.72]I need healing so bad.
[192:47.90]He still has like a little mustache.
[192:57.94]Anybody in the bathroom?
[192:58.52]Any bathroom mannequins?
[193:02.37]Okay, this is good.
[193:03.83]How much is in there?
[193:04.37]Three shots?
[193:06.39]Good enough.
[193:07.77]I guess.
[193:13.15]Nothing.
[193:13.47]Alright.
[193:21.83]Which one of these guys is the fake?
[193:25.03]You can always tell when they have the human skin underneath.
[193:30.28]Not this one.
[193:32.76]Not this one.
[193:34.96]None of these guys are fake.
[193:36.84]These guys are all real.
[193:39.00]Okay, that's good to know.
[193:45.43]Hey, eat, eat paint.
[193:48.23]Right, guys?
[193:50.27]See, it is a kid.
[193:51.27]It is just a kid.
[193:53.77]Leave me alone.
[193:55.25]The handprint and the paint.
[193:57.27]It is just like a four-year-old.
[193:58.85]That's the killer.
[194:08.06]Image received.
[194:09.50]Right-handed print missing the right index finger.
[194:12.68]Oh, what else?
[194:13.28]This matches what we got from the crime scene.
[194:15.22]It's a big hand for a kid.
[194:16.94]Look, they even called him a big boy.
[194:18.40]He's a big boy.
[194:21.67]I don't get it.
[194:23.49]What does that mean?
[194:25.13]I'm not sure.
[194:26.35]I'm just saying that the print from the tape recorder wasn't made by the same hand.
[194:36.13]Well.
[194:41.26]Need more.
[194:41.86]There's the blood.
[194:42.78]I got my bug light.
[194:47.98]And there we go.
[194:48.86]Take a picture of the mosquito blood.
[194:50.08]Uh, I just... I can see you.
[194:52.58]Hey, hey, excuse me.
[194:53.56]Excuse me.
[194:54.06]Okay.
[194:54.30]Well, she's gone.
[194:55.06]That's fine.
[195:12.90]I think she was going to find a weapon.
[195:14.78]That's okay.
[195:15.42]We'll just investigate a little bit more.
[195:19.48]Shotgun.
[195:20.32]Thank you.
[195:20.74]How many bullets?
[195:21.54]Two.
[195:23.22]Oh, it's a different kind of shotgun.
[195:25.46]It's one of these cool shotguns.
[195:29.89]I didn't know it was one of these coin shotguns.
[195:32.67]See, it shoots two coins.
[195:34.47]It's a fucking Super Mario shotgun.
[195:44.75]You were worthless.
[195:54.92]Alright.
[195:55.70]This is where I gotta be careful.
[195:56.90]He's one of these guys.
[195:57.84]He's gonna be a fake mannequin.
[196:01.60]Which one is it?
[196:05.34]It's the one without hair.
[196:08.74]Shit.
[196:08.94]They all have hair.
[196:09.92]Never mind.
[196:10.84]All of them have hair.
[196:22.95]more investigation save pull out t and let's find where this person was dragged away to that's scary alright there's another one right well they wouldn't put those guys in the beginning unless I was sure it was going to happen again right
[196:57.67]Well, you weren't pretending.
[197:01.59]You didn't do a very good job of pretending.
[197:04.51]Okay.
[197:05.89]That was just a, I'm going to walk at you regular.
[197:09.88]Please kill me.
[197:10.82]Another guy in here?
[197:22.57]No.
[197:25.37]He's following the snail trail.
[197:33.95]Is that one in there?
[197:36.23]No.
[197:36.83]I got him.
[197:44.19]I don't like how dark it is in here.
[197:46.25]No, I have to move this shit.
[197:57.42]Well, that's... Find root to the ground floor and continue to search.
[198:02.48]I can't just jump down there?
[198:04.89]Oh, whoops.
[198:08.65]Well, I probably shouldn't have done that.
[198:12.09]I don't think I was supposed to do what I just did, but it's okay.
[198:18.40]These can't be moved.
[198:23.68]Gas can?
[198:24.40]No, that's just a present.
[198:30.55]Well, shoot.
[198:34.66]Did I do it?
[198:35.10]Did I make a mistake?
[198:35.78]What am I missing?
[198:50.67]This has to be a... I can break this, right?
[198:53.79]This has break with a sledgehammer all over it.
[198:55.81]It's just plaster.
[198:59.63]Apparently not.
[199:10.18]Guess I can't go this way.
[199:19.55]Can't go this way either.
[199:22.97]Break the supports?
[199:23.73]That's what I was thinking too.
[199:27.67]Oh, here we go.
[199:34.93]I hear now.
[199:36.25]I knew it.
[199:36.67]I heard him.
[199:37.13]And the game froze to give me an opportunity.
[199:44.44]There's another one behind me, too.
[199:46.68]They're wearing Santa masks.
[199:49.58]That's not terrifying at all.
[199:51.51]Am I invincible?
[199:56.97]Not really.
[199:57.59]Fuck!
[199:59.37]In the back of the head.
[200:18.97]These guys do look like BioShock enemies.
[200:23.23]BioShock Infinity.
[200:26.31]I lost my place.
[200:28.85]It's like a sledgehammer door.
[200:29.87]Where the hell is it?
[200:36.73]Taser is OP.
[200:37.65]It is.
[200:38.57]It's very good.
[200:42.02]I would say it's probably the best thing in the game.
[200:54.86]I'm so paranoid of somebody just collapsing behind me.
[201:02.80]And of course he has a gun.
[201:09.30]He just wasted all of his bullets, thankfully.
[201:21.00]And forward we move.
[201:22.41]Oh, there's a guy there.
[201:23.41]I hit that guy.
[201:31.57]I broke that guy's hand so bad that he died.
[201:38.33]Hey.
[201:39.73]Don't throw boxes at me.
[201:42.73]That's not very nice.
[201:44.61]I've got a guy with a gun.
[201:50.60]Give me the gun.
[201:52.66]Who else has a gun?
[202:01.16]Oh, damn it.
[202:01.58]I was trying to pick her off.
[202:05.08]What about trace evidence?
[202:06.98]Looking for a place to go here.
[202:12.28]Ah, that's not right.
[202:16.92]Gun size, it is huge.
[202:20.49]It's alright, though.
[202:21.05]You know, it's not... It's huge, but I have not gotten annoyed or motion sick or anything playing this game.
[202:29.23]I don't think this is 90 FOV, but... It's not caused me any issues.
[202:41.18]What the hell?
[202:41.76]What am I looking for here?
[202:43.62]The drag marks?
[202:49.98]past the first gate.
[202:50.90]I think I got bit by a mosquito down here.
[202:58.67]I hate when you get bit by a mosquito that you don't see.
[203:01.89]Because you feel like you've just been slighted.
[203:06.77]I always get the mosquitoes.
[203:15.06]The mosquitoes in my room, they're done.
[203:18.92]I feel like I got stealth killed by a mosquito when I get bit and I don't know it.
[203:30.79]That mosquito got up behind me and pressed E. And got me.
[203:35.15]Well, I'll take your full shotgun.
[203:52.65]How many bullets are in here?
[203:53.53]Yeah, five.
[203:55.51]We got a quick save.
[204:04.52]And guess what?
[204:05.06]You can get stealth killed by a mosquito more than like three or four times.
[204:07.90]Those are all real.
[204:18.59]Um, okay.
[204:22.33]No, not this.
[204:23.57]Which one?
[204:23.89]Does this guy have skin?
[204:26.93]Ah!
[204:31.21]I can't open this.
[204:33.15]Um, well, we're gonna go over here.
[204:36.26]Yeah, hi.
[204:37.88]Hello.
[204:39.44]It's been real fun, but I think I have to go in here now.
[204:44.84]Yes, I do.
[204:48.23]Hee hee, Slenderman.
[204:51.72]And this is well before the Slender Man craze.
[204:53.68]Somebody just sucked him back down.
[205:04.93]He either got sucked down or he fell, I'm not sure.
[205:08.25]No, let's take a look over here first.
[205:12.13]What else we got?
[205:13.09]Nothing.
[205:15.17]Nothing.
[205:18.63]Oh, there is something.
[205:21.06]Sawed off.
[205:24.11]No, I'll give you the five.
[205:24.81]How many bolts are in here?
[205:26.25]Three?
[205:26.73]Four?
[205:26.97]Five?
[205:28.43]There's a fiver in there still.
[205:36.17]There's a five piece in here.
[205:39.82]Perfect amount of McNuggets.
[205:42.84]If you're into eating McNuggets, I suggest the five piece.
[205:48.39]Highly recommend it.
[205:49.17]Except, no, fuck McDonald's nuggets.
[205:50.63]They're not even that good.
[205:54.01]Burger King... I'm going to give you the nugget breakdown, guys.
[205:58.50]Burger King's nuggets taste the best, but they're always cold when you get them.
[206:04.80]Every time I get Burger King McNuggets... Every time I get Burger King nuggets, they're not warm.
[206:10.54]They're, like, lukewarm and they're kind of gross, but they taste really good.
[206:13.67]They're the best tasting nugget.
[206:15.51]Temperature is a problem.
[206:17.23]McDonald's has the best temperature of their nuggets, but they're gross.
[206:22.81]And they have this weird, like, chicken skin outer crust.
[206:27.37]It's like biting into a piece of cardboard and glass mixed together.
[206:31.75]And then there's chicken in the middle.
[206:33.95]Wendy's, on the other hand, has a perfect balance of cardboard glass outside, but not really.
[206:40.58]Temperature's not the hottest I would ever want in my life.
[206:45.09]But they're the straight up perfect balance flavor, outer crust, and temperature.
[206:53.59]I would say Burger King has probably... Burger King's nuggets taste the best.
[206:57.39]But they get an F in every other fucking category, so they're the worst.
[207:00.78]I need a fire axe.
[207:14.38]Investigate.
[207:18.33]Oh, I found the trail.
[207:20.93]Trail's gonna go cold up here.
[207:27.25]Time for a flashback.
[207:28.45]Remember what you did?
[207:34.54]Yeah, you do.
[207:35.38]Of course you do.
[207:42.58]You're insulted?
[207:45.23]You shouldn't be.
[207:49.46]Burger King, everything at Burger King tastes better than all the other fast food places.
[207:54.68]But Burger King is gross.
[207:57.06]Burger King is really fatty.
[207:58.76]Really, Burger King doesn't give a shit.
[208:00.96]You know?
[208:02.71]All the stuff, all the menu items.
[208:03.91]Do you have a fucking ham?
[208:07.65]No.
[208:08.05]Okay.
[208:08.67]What the hell was that?
[208:13.04]All the shit at Burger King is really bad for you.
[208:15.66]But they don't give a fuck.
[208:17.22]They just want to make sure it tastes good.
[208:18.82]And that's what it shows.
[208:21.58]Tastes really good.
[208:22.66]All the food at Burger King is fucking great.
[208:26.49]Now McDonald's got into a lot of trouble.
[208:29.81]Because McDonald's tried to, they got like a lot of flack because they used like beef fat to fry their french fries in.
[208:37.13]And their hamburgers were full of like all kinds of fucking processed dog shit.
[208:40.66]And they're the big guys, right?
[208:41.54]So they're like the number one.
[208:42.32]So they get all the flack for it.
[208:43.72]So McDonald's over the years had to like health up its menu and make it like a little healthier.
[208:49.22]We don't use this fat anymore.
[208:50.62]We don't like, I'm walking in circles.
[208:53.42]McDonald's got all the flack.
[208:54.44]So McDonald's had to like adapt to all the criticism.
[209:00.44]Wendy's, on the other hand, has always been, like, top tier.
[209:05.69]Always.
[209:06.69]Where's this fire axe?
[209:13.07]See, what you could do is you could go get every good... You could go do the fast food shuffle.
[209:19.46]And that means if there's a Wendy's and Burger King and a McDonald's around you, you stop at Wendy's first.
[209:24.06]You grab the nuggets and the chicken sandwiches from Wendy's.
[209:28.65]Circle down to Burger King.
[209:30.45]You grab like a BK stacker from Burger King.
[209:33.37]Wrap around back to McDonald's and get a number one.
[209:35.78]And then that's the fast food shuffle.
[209:38.46]You hit all the good bases.
[209:39.64]I guess that is the ran dry.
[209:46.80]Okay.
[209:56.63]And then when you're all done...
[209:58.87]With all that food, go to Taco Bell, get one item, and shit your pants when you're done.
[210:04.62]Compiling.
[210:18.91]Cross-referencing.
[210:21.07]The footprint is an exact match to the print I found in the metro station car.
[210:25.41]It may be the matchmaker, but I'm
[210:29.81]I'm a hypocrite because I love Taco Bell.
[210:31.67]Is it true?
[210:32.33]Body produces...
[210:55.40]Sulfuric acid?
[210:56.84]Use the gas spectrometer.
[210:58.24]That's such a fake name.
[211:00.82]What's going on behind there?
[211:03.42]Almost.
[211:04.94]Almost got me.
[211:05.40]Look, I could rate you guys the top...
[211:23.75]The top fast food items that exist.
[211:25.93]And guess what?
[211:26.43]Taco Bell is number one.
[211:29.71]Taco Bell is a dirty, disgusting, awful shit place.
[211:33.57]But they have the number one fast food item.
[211:35.79]It's the best fast food item.
[211:37.61]Perfect in every single way.
[211:40.48]In every single way.
[211:42.08]There is nothing wrong with this.
[211:43.58]I would eat it every day if I could.
[211:46.88]You want to know what it is?
[211:47.54]What is number one?
[211:53.25]Good morning.
[211:58.58]Number one is the cheesy gordita crunch.
[212:04.63]Bar none, the absolute best fast food item that has ever existed.
[212:13.23]Tap water.
[212:29.58]Okay.
[212:31.56]Nice dive, dude.
[212:36.44]Yite.
[212:43.76]Come on.
[212:45.32]Stop doing the fake-out shit.
[212:49.02]You shouldn't be able to do that.
[212:50.07]It's not fair.
[212:54.01]Oh, we're going to break her neck.
[212:54.79]No, we're going to slam.
[213:00.39]And this is coming from somebody that loves Taco Bell.
[213:04.27]I love Taco Bell.
[213:06.27]But I'm not going to pretend that it's like an A-plus restaurant.
[213:12.18]It isn't.
[213:16.58]It's awesome.
[213:17.86]I can't deny it.
[213:22.51]Am I going to lose my sponsorship?
[213:24.67]Doesn't Taco Bell actually do sponsors?
[213:26.53]I never want to do that.
[213:33.01]Like, what, am I going to eat Taco Bell on stream?
[213:35.47]Do people do that?
[213:36.43]Good thing I turned around.
[213:50.78]No, I just shocked her into the water.
[213:53.14]Apparently that water is very deep right there.
[213:55.68]Oh my lord, how did that not block?
[213:57.24]I don't... I... I could have just dropped down a sinkhole.
[214:03.70]I didn't even do anything.
[214:19.59]Don't just feel like that's really typical.
[214:21.93]I feel like getting a fast food sponsorship is super typical.
[214:27.02]Like, gamer, I eat a bunch of fucking trash fast food.
[214:31.32]I want to get sponsored by, like... Fresh-o-matic juice!
[214:41.68]Fresh-pressed juice!
[214:44.24]At only $9 a bottle!
[214:47.96]We remove all of the nutrients when we fresh press juice.
[214:58.84]You're left with kind of smelly, gross water.
[215:02.75]Everything else is removed.
[215:08.17]I need to break down another door, don't I?
[215:17.43]Where is it?
[215:18.17]Where's the smoothie?
[215:19.23]Not the smoothie, the fruit juice.
[215:20.47]Where's the juice?
[215:21.15]Where's the fresh, fresh juice?
[215:24.40]I'm going the wrong way.
[215:32.06]There was another door I needed to break and I don't know where the hell it is.
[215:34.71]It's over here somewhere.
[215:44.77]Smoothies?
[215:47.59]What's that thing with Drake?
[215:49.62]Where he's like, no, no, no.
[215:51.34]Yeah.
[215:52.10]You know that one I'm talking about?
[215:54.54]Fresh pressed juice is the no, no, no.
[215:57.78]And then the smoothie, like a blended smoothie where you don't just get rid of all the fiber and shit.
[216:03.87]That's like the mm-hmm.
[216:13.79]Where am I going?
[216:15.43]I need to, like, pay attention for a second.
[216:16.75]I think I just need to go back.
[216:28.70]I think we need to go back.
[216:30.26]Okay, here we go.
[216:35.10]Now it stinks.
[216:37.13]Now I gotta charge my battery here.
[216:39.35]I got low battery.
[216:40.23]The smellier the world gets, the more battery I get.
[216:45.87]I gotta find, like, the stinkiest, smelliest thing here.
[216:52.90]To charge my gigantic iPhone canteen.
[217:02.79]I hear somebody.
[217:08.01]There is a person over there in the corner.
[217:11.91]You can't fool me!
[217:15.36]Told you.
[217:18.53]There's another guy.
[217:19.27]He's got a big weapon.
[217:23.41]Shit, I missed.
[217:24.23]Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
[217:28.49]That was a quick way to die.
[217:32.63]Nah, that body wasn't smelly enough.
[217:35.57]We need to find the stinkiest body.
[217:39.47]Find the guy or the girl that just spent 12 hours at the gym.
[217:45.12]And now I've been wearing the same clothes for like nine days.
[217:48.53]I think we're losing it.
[217:53.89]We're losing the smell.
[217:59.49]Back out here.
[218:03.22]This guy's gonna find like Burger Boy's gym bag.
[218:06.80]Where is it?
[218:10.70]Source of the stink.
[218:14.82]There it is.
[218:17.04]I heard a lot of... This is what I was talking about.
[218:19.12]Listen to this.
[218:19.98]This sounds like somebody's running up the stairs with me.
[218:24.61]Why do I shuffle my feet?
[218:25.69]We're on the right track?
[218:37.24]Kind of.
[218:37.84]I would assume we are.
[218:45.78]When it gets all fuzzy like this, I don't like it.
[218:47.48]There, it's in this room.
[219:01.57]Here's Jeremy.
[219:05.01]Will you do it?
[219:05.57]Come on.
[219:11.16]Almost there.
[219:14.97]Almost there.
[219:16.33]Down, and I'm going to say to the left.
[219:18.87]There's going to be people down here that are going to wake up and scream at me.
[219:25.63]Save it before the inevitable death.
[219:31.29]There's the smelly thing.
[219:33.87]No.
[219:34.23]Wait, what?
[219:40.97]What have I done?
[219:43.80]I was so close.
[219:44.58]Wait, what?
[219:50.05]I was so close.
[219:50.87]What happened?
[219:51.97]Oh, I went the other way.
[219:52.71]What a dummy.
[220:01.65]Can't go in here.
[220:07.03]Shit.
[220:10.63]That was a full circle.
[220:17.07]Can I open this?
[220:18.09]Can I squeeze under here?
[220:19.08]I don't think so.
[220:26.58]Up this way?
[220:28.88]I think.
[220:31.70]I'm gonna follow like the ectometer.
[220:35.26]Ah, here we go.
[220:35.96]Okay, I didn't even know this was a good, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[220:42.32]Eat that bird's ass.
[220:45.16]What are you on about, man?
[220:48.58]Here we go.
[220:49.66]Right way.
[220:50.11]We found the right way.
[220:50.83]It just took us like six extra minutes.
[220:53.35]I don't want anybody coming to find me.
[221:02.10]Break this because an emergency will be right here.
[221:08.20]And smell-o-meter.
[221:10.20]It is.
[221:11.18]Oh, I think we found it.
[221:14.61]Somebody sure did stink up this changing room.
[221:17.13]Ah, great.
[221:19.17]Nobody shit in the changing room.
[221:30.47]Yep.
[221:30.97]Let's just pick a door.
[221:34.50]You think anybody's ever shit in a changing room?
[221:36.08]Like, I feel like somebody may have.
[221:42.62]What's in one of these?
[221:47.82]Search the dressing rooms.
[221:48.62]The body is somewhere in this area.
[221:50.03]Well, it's time to pick a door.
[221:53.03]And door number one is going to have nothing.
[221:56.43]I can see through the doors, though, and I can tell if a guy's in them ready to jump out at me.
[222:01.29]So let's just find the door.
[222:03.06]Okay, there's probably a guy in this one.
[222:05.28]I can see through.
[222:09.68]Nobody in this one.
[222:16.40]Why would you have this many doors to open if there was no jumpscare behind one?
[222:20.50]That seemed kind of... counterintuitive.
[222:23.35]Okay, let's investigate.
[222:32.48]It's like somebody's engagement photo.
[222:43.01]The opposite of normal.
[222:53.04]Yeah, it's a dead guy.
[222:56.50]Photograph the victim's face.
[223:01.38]I know what's going to happen here.
[223:02.74]Let's preemptively hit him.
[223:06.24]I can't hit him.
[223:06.76]You know what's going to happen.
[223:10.47]Well, prepare.
[223:11.37]I'm ready for it.
[223:11.97]I'm going to click and he's going to scream and jump in front of the camera.
[223:23.66]No.
[223:23.90]Which one of them is the victim?
[223:25.28]Thomas, get a shot of his rectum.
[223:39.81]He's missing the finger.
[223:45.44]This is the guy.
[223:46.26]This is our perp.
[223:53.32]Yes, he did.
[224:08.84]Mm-hmm.
[224:10.57]Ah, somebody strangled him.
[224:13.07]He strangled himself.
[224:20.67]Damn.
[224:21.51]No usable DNA traces.
[224:23.29]Killer must have worn gloves.
[224:24.81]But there is something.
[224:26.71]What is it?
[224:28.26]How do you wear gloves and leave marks like that?
[224:30.10]Small particles that show up as a potential organophosphate pesticide.
[224:34.92]I'll work more on that and see what we get.
[224:36.46]We're going in here.
[224:39.57]What?
[224:42.23]Wait, what?
[224:46.32]Did that guy just say, Agent Thomas, I know you're in there.
[224:49.06]Give yourself up.
[224:58.48]Who the fuck is that?
[225:00.20]And why did he pee his pants?
[225:02.12]That guy blood peed his pants.
[225:24.05]Okay, his pee blood is gone.
[225:26.97]Who is this guy?
[225:27.99]What?
[225:28.21]We?
[225:30.73]Were you with this guy?
[225:34.71]He must have been working together.
[225:45.51]Where's the Wii in this scenario?
[225:50.05]I don't know.
[225:52.01]So now what?
[225:54.77]Avoid the police is the new objective.
[226:00.20]Okay.
[226:08.88]These cops are so awful.
[226:10.14]You guys all have guns.
[226:13.12]Wow, that was so loud.
[226:15.42]Why was that guy made out of glass?
[226:17.90]That guy was glass.
[226:22.10]What the fuck, man?
[226:26.45]That was so loud.
[226:32.83]Oh, give me the shotgun.
[226:36.09]Glass bones and paper skin.
[226:44.67]I think I've got something, Thomas.
[226:47.27]The newspaper clippings you found in the room at the metro station?
[226:50.04]We got something.
[226:50.78]Each of the articles talks about a serial killer.
[226:53.42]A serial killer that was on your case list.
[226:56.48]Nine names were mentioned.
[226:58.14]Of those, seven of the nine were crossed out in each of the clippings by a black felt tip marker.
[227:04.57]The only names that weren't crossed out were the batchmaker and the torturer.
[227:09.21]The torturer.
[227:13.42]Wait.
[227:13.72]It must be me.
[227:14.38]It's me.
[227:14.82]Is it a golf club?
[227:16.52]No.
[227:16.58]No.
[227:41.33]Did somebody just... Hold on.
[227:42.83]Wait a minute.
[227:43.27]Wait a minute.
[227:43.63]Did that guy just drop down?
[227:46.63]And die?
[227:48.55]Oh, they're throwing gas in here.
[227:49.85]I think that guy just fell down.
[227:53.07]Look, let's just get... I'm not gonna fight this guy.
[227:58.42]We're gonna get out of here.
[227:59.64]Look, we're all just escaping.
[228:00.58]It's just an evacuation.
[228:03.78]They all actually are evacuating.
[228:05.36]Alright, let us out of here.
[228:09.70]You're not, you're not working together with the team.
[228:11.78]You're not working with the team, man.
[228:16.58]I've let that guy, I've let that guy's face off.
[228:28.02]Made it.
[228:33.76]Evac in 30 seconds.
[228:35.22]My favorite weapon is always the shotgun.
[228:38.24]I love shotguns.
[228:40.59]Killed by melee combat.
[228:41.87]Quite a few because I'm having trouble blocking because I'm terrible.
[228:54.12]There's the two ring seekers.
[228:55.90]Is there another guy that I should know about?
[229:13.12]You think he's better than me?
[229:14.22]Does he make more money than me?
[229:16.72]Is he better looking than me?
[229:18.59]Tell me.
[229:19.73]Let me know.
[229:20.49]Tell me the truth.
[229:21.13]Is he bigger than me?
[229:22.25]Two free birds.
[229:22.69]Problem.
[229:42.85]He likes to abduct people, torture them for fun, then let them loose and hunt them down.
[229:47.58]His goal is to drive them to suicide so he doesn't actually deliver the final blow.
[229:51.60]What is this city you're coming to?
[229:54.42]Alright, so I've gotta find the torturer and save his ass so the new killer doesn't kill him?
[230:01.31]Life of an agent.
[230:03.31]Yeah, well, I'm no longer an agent, apparently.
[230:06.61]Sorry.
[230:11.16]Rat cam.
[230:11.76]It's a setup, don't do it.
[230:13.48]Woo!
[230:40.65]It's not giving me that much time.
[230:43.08]Fifteen minutes.
[230:44.02]I'd be lucky if I get there in like two hours.
[230:47.82]I got a locker door.
[230:53.22]Perfect weapon.
[230:54.82]Two free dead birds.
[230:59.45]They made that real easy.
[231:05.07]Save this.
[231:06.45]Alright, let's go.
[231:12.48]Not so sneaky.
[231:17.73]Whoa.
[231:19.79]Unlock achievement.
[231:23.81]I turned off the television.
[231:25.36]Achievement unlocked.
[231:28.76]That was one special TV.
[231:30.90]What?
[231:35.20]Wait, was that the bad guy?
[231:37.77]Hold on, wait.
[231:42.69]Did the Gordon's fisherman just try to attack me and I instantly killed him?
[231:55.66]You don't block that.
[231:57.50]I'm sorry.
[231:57.98]Nice fish flop.
[232:07.03]I just got dolphin dived.
[232:10.39]Why are you all doing this?
[232:26.50]Trust the Gordon's Fisherman.
[232:29.06]You guys have that?
[232:30.50]Do you guys have a Gordon's Fisherman where you are?
[232:47.76]I don't think I even want the shotgun.
[232:50.20]No.
[232:51.06]Why would I?
[232:53.66]We're doing straight up yellow door.
[232:57.78]Alright.
[232:58.06]Give me the gun for a second.
[232:59.56]This is important.
[233:00.44]Shit.
[233:00.76]God damn it.
[233:02.02]He made...
[233:23.20]Well, at least he'll be hurt for when I inevitably door his ass.
[233:28.08]Dead bird.
[233:38.09]Police?
[233:38.49]These police are so bad.
[233:49.70]I don't even think that guy died.
[233:51.48]That guy had a heart attack.
[233:54.32]All these cops in this game are so awful.
[234:00.97]Is it everybody's first day?
[234:02.39]Look at how easily I took him out with a locker door.
[234:08.19]You guys are doing it wrong.
[234:16.60]Did we find out why we're collecting birds?
[234:19.02]Not yet.
[234:19.42]Not that I'm aware of.
[234:24.26]I'm gonna wait for him.
[234:25.58]I thought that was a guy.
[234:26.62]Who's gonna win?
[234:38.53]Who's gonna win?
[234:39.27]Guy on the right.
[234:41.25]Fuck, I lost.
[234:49.93]I mean, I guess I kind of do look like a psycho.
[234:52.19]If I'm talking about like outside perspective looking in... I am carrying around a fucking school locker.
[235:00.38]I would want to shoot me too if I was a cop up there.
[235:06.80]I'm just part of like the mayhem.
[235:11.60]Can I hide in the dumpster?
[235:20.05]Oh no!
[235:20.75]It's a mirror match!
[235:24.03]This is fucking top six at Evo!
[235:30.97]Ah yeah, that's right, Jerma out at five has a much better locker room guy.
[235:34.43]Let's get a gun.
[235:41.88]Exit through the gate?
[235:42.70]Oh, that gate.
[235:43.42]Which gate?
[235:53.66]He's just shooting from down here.
[235:55.10]Oh god.
[236:00.96]It's just carnage.
[236:05.55]Oh, locker room door match and mirror matches.
[236:10.53]Get off my fucking mine cart!
[236:13.53]Get out of here!
[236:14.83]Wow!
[236:15.45]What?
[236:15.79]Is he on fire?
[236:17.42]What is happening?
[236:19.74]Is that gonna explode?
[236:21.86]What is going on right now?
[236:24.38]How am I moving?
[236:27.06]I'm gonna die.
[236:27.68]Shit.
[236:40.04]What the hell was that?
[236:40.94]What was that noise?
[236:41.76]Oh, we've been trained for this.
[236:42.70]Thomas, I'm at the library.
[236:44.56]Where are you?
[236:46.12]I am same cop model number 9000.
[236:51.14]I don't know.
[236:51.52]I'm going to be behind this broken down car.
[236:56.25]There's a door open right here.
[236:58.03]I don't know.
[236:59.21]I have no idea.
[237:00.59]I love this game.
[237:02.75]This game is great.
[237:19.04]That was a whole chapter.
[237:20.44]Favorite weapon.
[237:21.58]Locker door.
[237:24.92]Killed 11 people with a locker door.
[237:31.93]Blowing through.
[237:32.43]There's a cutscene here.
[237:51.55]I scared more bugs away.
[237:52.67]So I have to meet this person in the library.
[237:58.70]This is a setup.
[237:59.30]This is absolutely a setup.
[238:02.88]It's going to be... Rosa's going to have just a voice changer and it's going to be the main bad guy.
[238:06.77]He could just do a really good, really convincing female voice.
[238:14.59]And we're all going to go, what?
[238:16.29]Oh my god.
[238:19.58]I'm not comfortable without a weapon here.
[238:24.22]Or she'll just be dead.
[238:25.06]You're right.
[238:27.54]I want my locker door back.
[238:28.70]I don't feel confident without it.
[238:33.08]I just feel something's missing without that door.
[238:37.28]Nothing can replace it.
[238:38.16]I don't feel good right now.
[238:41.27]Stapler?
[238:47.27]What is that?
[238:58.52]Was George Washington a sheriff?
[239:05.65]My entire American history is kind of freaking out right now.
[239:08.51]It's like wrong.
[239:09.13]Let's go.
[239:15.43]Where am I meeting her?
[239:22.77]I need a weapon.
[239:23.45]Give me like a chair leg.
[239:25.77]Anything.
[239:30.03]Give me like the bottom of a wheelchair for all I care.
[239:41.31]Whatever.
[239:41.63]I guess we're going to the basement.
[239:44.75]This is the 13th floor.
[239:56.22]Is that supposed to be her?
[240:04.45]Thomas?
[240:08.72]I was just made of rats the whole time.
[240:10.20]That's not even scary.
[240:14.54]That's cool.
[240:15.44]That's really awesome.
[240:23.60]Easy, mate.
[240:32.27]Anybody else feel like that's what I'm going to look like in 30 or 40 years?
[240:36.76]Remove the hair.
[240:40.32]Give it my hair.
[240:41.12]I feel like I'm going to look like that.
[240:43.24]I'm going to dress like that, too.
[240:46.02]Fuck it.
[240:46.53]At that point, who cares?
[240:48.31]Nothing matters anymore.
[240:50.45]I'm going to dress like a... Look, look, look.
[240:53.43]Why is it that back in the day, back during the Revolutionary times and George Washington times, everybody dressed like a clown?
[241:02.30]Put your thumb over this image and put a clown face on here.
[241:07.56]That is what a current 21st century clown would wear.
[241:14.44]Take a look at all these old photos, all these old pictures.
[241:17.36]They're in clown costumes.
[241:19.89]Crowbar.
[241:25.05]They didn't dress like that normally.
[241:26.47]Look, excuse me.
[241:28.07]There's no pictures of George Washington in sweatpants and like a tank top on.
[241:33.14]They dress like that every day.
[241:34.40]Have you ever seen the old movies?
[241:36.14]They put the wigs on.
[241:36.91]That's all they do.
[241:40.25]There's no photo of, like, George Washington in a tank top with Thomas Jefferson in a headlock, like, giving him, like, a, like, hey, I got you, buddy.
[241:47.63]Like, there's no pictures of that.
[241:51.24]They didn't do that.
[241:51.88]They didn't have email back then.
[242:01.40]Interesting.
[242:03.52]looking at like porn magazine there are no photos of George Washington no there's not is that me Thomas over here this might not have been a good idea swatters and addicts have moved in and they don't like company come this way I have something to show you
[242:25.42]We're like the same person.
[242:26.44]I used my security clearance to do a little checking up on you.
[242:30.66]I found this folder in your supplemental personnel file.
[242:32.98]And this ectoplasm reader.
[242:34.66]Alright, should I preemptively swing the printer at her?
[242:43.01]That's what I would do in this situation.
[242:47.81]Forget about you.
[242:48.35]We're going to find some ghosts.
[242:51.53]For starters, your bone and muscle densities are off the charts.
[242:54.85]He's a super soldier.
[242:55.33]Redacted?
[243:10.20]Right where your esophagus and larynx are.
[243:12.52]Someone's blacked out the x-ray and added the notation.
[243:14.89]Tomica Super Soldier.
[243:17.85]A PR-56 is a special addendum to a personnel record, and yours is classified black.
[243:23.99]That's pretty top-level security.
[243:25.72]I'm a mutant.
[243:26.30]Way beyond either you or me.
[243:28.64]Our government is awfully interested in you.
[243:31.32]I didn't know.
[243:33.34]Turn the page.
[243:33.94]You got a couple of... Oh, nice.
[243:35.56]She gave you a new taser?
[243:36.64]Well, it doesn't work on her.
[243:38.80]What else is in here?
[243:39.84]That kid's really interesting.
[243:40.77]You can have your notebook back.
[244:10.96]Huh?
[244:13.06]Oh, there it is.
[244:17.58]That's just the guy from Outlast.
[244:19.38]The doctor from Outlast.
[244:20.52]This must be a prequel.
[244:21.26]Isn't Steve Blum the actor for both these guys?
[244:23.31]Hello.
[244:23.55]Hello.
[244:41.60]Okay, I just, like, her neck was, like, cocking left and right.
[244:45.72]That worked on her.
[244:46.62]It just didn't do what I thought was going to happen.
[244:50.86]I just gave her, like, a neck spasm.
[244:55.22]She's going to scream.
[244:57.48]Paper cutter.
[244:58.46]Okay, that's awesome.
[245:02.10]I just alleviated some tension in her neck.
[245:04.64]What was this?
[245:07.75]Uh, yeah.
[245:08.81]I think I'll take the desk drawer.
[245:11.32]Give me that draw.
[245:19.32]There he is.
[245:22.95]Get him.
[245:30.51]Whoa!
[245:32.75]I'm dead.
[245:37.08]I'm trying to like chase the guy.
[245:39.96]Trying to chase this area.
[245:40.90]I gotta do this again.
[245:41.66]That was funny.
[245:43.39]Hee-haw, ho-haw.
[245:44.99]Ha-ha.
[245:47.31]Give me the draw.
[245:49.05]Hee-haw.
[245:51.25]Ha-ha.
[246:05.38]Bring it in.
[246:09.34]Now he's angry.
[246:13.42]Alright, well, they were imagination.
[246:17.60]Can I get up there?
[246:18.46]No.
[246:20.13]It was just my imagination.
[246:21.55]I kind of want the paper cutter.
[246:22.53]Yeah, this doesn't want damage.
[246:23.49]Take this damn thing.
[246:24.21]I'm not going to use the draw anymore.
[246:28.73]They were using the draw.
[246:30.51]I got to go like the other Pokémon.
[246:33.08]I have to counter their draw with paper cutter.
[246:36.96]So they're doing paper...
[246:40.71]I told you you weren't alone.
[246:43.13]Come on, I found a working computer.
[246:45.60]Yeah, paper meets cutter.
[246:50.76]How does it spell?
[246:51.22]Rock, paper, scissors, right?
[246:52.08]So scissors, they had paper, I had scissors.
[246:54.48]Yeah.
[246:55.76]If I see another guy with a draw, I gotta get rock.
[246:57.48]Rock is the concrete.
[246:59.99]It's a search engine specific to the library.
[247:02.79]Just type in the torturer's name and we should get the latest info from the local news, including broadcast feeds.
[247:08.35]Okay.
[247:09.79]Use the computer.
[247:14.86]I need to be looking at the computer.
[247:16.10]I'm just staring at the keyboard.
[247:18.82]I'm not even looking at the screen.
[247:26.51]She's gone now.
[247:30.93]Search the torturer.
[247:35.93]Here comes another handful.
[247:38.57]What's the innate ability here?
[247:45.86]being choked types like me yeah he does well Thomas you're certainly not as much help as I thought you would be I'd expected so much more from you I was thinking Rosa Rosa are you there
[248:16.26]Rose has been abducted.
[248:17.89]Find her.
[248:21.11]I'll try.
[248:21.73]I can't.
[248:23.03]No guarantees.
[248:35.82]Dead bird.
[248:36.58]Perfect.
[248:40.40]I need a fire axe.
[248:46.39]Mm-hmm.
[248:47.41]Organic evidence.
[248:48.21]There it is.
[248:48.67]Well, I can't call it in.
[248:49.63]How am I going to call this in?
[248:54.23]I'm going to call myself on the phone.
[248:56.03]Oh, there's her phone.
[248:57.09]Oh.
[248:57.23]Should I pick it up?
[248:58.13]I'll pick it up and store it.
[248:59.51]Looks like Rosa's phone is in the server room.
[249:01.53]Find a way in.
[249:01.93]I need an axe.
[249:16.41]And hello.
[249:25.02]Gas pipe.
[249:27.92]That guy's got an axe.
[249:28.50]That guy's got an axe.
[249:29.46]Give me the axe.
[249:36.34]Brain him.
[249:37.84]You weren't even close.
[249:41.28]Really?
[249:43.16]Alright, we're upgrading.
[249:46.71]This is just gun game.
[249:48.39]CSGO gun game.
[249:49.65]There he goes.
[249:49.99]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[249:54.60]Give me the gun.
[249:56.32]Give me the gun.
[250:03.64]Guy with the axe ran down here.
[250:06.97]Where is he?
[250:13.84]This is fucking up books, man.
[250:14.98]You're just messing around too much.
[250:17.96]Look, you know what I was trying to do, and it was... Asshole.
[250:40.06]Get...
[250:51.31]He was hiding.
[250:52.51]He really didn't think I was going to get him.
[250:54.29]Okay, calm down, calm down.
[250:55.39]Don't lose it here.
[250:56.03]I'm like laughing and being a fucking idiot.
[251:00.30]You're a little too tall.
[251:05.50]His head just sticking straight up.
[251:07.32]He did not think that was going to happen.
[251:12.08]Oh, he ran out of bullets.
[251:14.15]He was using it as a melee weapon.
[251:16.57]Oh, what a dingus.
[251:18.37]I can't use that.
[251:21.34]What the hell was that?
[251:26.14]Oh, is that guy shooting me?
[251:27.80]Okay, I'm going to actually shoot him with this.
[251:30.46]Because I don't have to run in front of him and die?
[251:37.19]God fucking damn it.
[251:54.80]He was just waiting for me.
[251:56.34]Let me see, like, Snoke's face when we die.
[252:08.61]Whatever, let's just go.
[252:09.59]And I ju- Oh no!
[252:23.21]Oh no.
[252:25.13]Oh no.
[252:26.69]This is bad.
[252:27.29]This is really bad.
[252:28.08]I think this might be the end.
[252:29.48]This is not good.
[252:31.62]Hi.
[252:34.14]Oh no.
[252:36.15]Oh no, guys.
[252:55.91]Thank God.
[252:56.39]I just have to be smart.
[253:12.58]He's just waiting for me.
[253:14.16]No matter where I go, he's going to shoot.
[253:33.11]God, come on!
[253:33.97]None of these have any bullets!
[253:50.90]Does the taser reach that far?
[253:53.36]Can I tase him from here?
[253:54.30]Okay, that goes very far.
[253:57.62]That goes really far.
[254:04.41]Not getting up from that.
[254:12.58]Oh yeah, I did snipe somebody a long time ago, didn't I?
[254:17.40]I'm in deep shit though.
[254:21.84]I need healing.
[254:27.50]I need to get like a box of healing.
[254:29.36]And there it is.
[254:31.62]Four.
[254:37.89]I'm going to go over a scenario there that I think happened.
[254:42.09]He came up from in that room, and I didn't know he was coming behind me.
[254:46.90]I swung to break this, and the backswing hit him in the face, which knocked him out, and then I killed him with another swing.
[254:57.18]I believe that's what happened, I think.
[255:09.74]What?
[255:11.44]How are these people just dying?
[255:12.36]I don't understand.
[255:13.98]Why are you dead?
[255:16.25]I didn't even break this.
[255:17.71]I'm really confused.
[255:18.77]Okay.
[255:20.61]Let's just go in here.
[255:24.05]Get the cell phone.
[255:28.21]And there it is.
[255:29.27]Identify.
[255:29.81]I don't have to do evidence on it.
[255:34.59]I want to get the cell phones right there.
[255:38.29]I don't need to find evidence here.
[255:39.95]I already know it's there.
[255:43.29]Pick up the phone.
[255:48.59]What?
[255:51.09]Now is not the time to do detective work.
[256:01.88]Huh?
[256:02.50]Why?
[256:04.38]Why do I care about this right now?
[256:05.82]I want to...
[256:12.79]It's definitely only one of the... I don't even know.
[256:14.83]Whatever.
[256:15.09]We have to find it apparently.
[256:22.67]The save?
[256:23.33]Wiped?
[256:23.61]How come when I step out of here it doesn't want me to do it?
[256:29.51]Every time I come over here it doesn't want me... I can't press it.
[256:31.30]I can't do it.
[256:35.88]Find organic evidence.
[256:37.88]Like that.
[256:39.72]But when I press T it puts it away.
[256:45.14]I think the game might be broken.
[256:46.18]Either that or I'm doing the wrong thing.
[256:49.52]Uh-oh.
[256:57.73]Uh-oh.
[257:01.21]This doesn't look good.
[257:07.42]What happens if I... Let me try and go back and forth again.
[257:12.16]So, right here.
[257:32.95]um well guys I have a theory let's let's test that theory the theory is I think I may have it might be under this wait what turn the lights off what are you talking about
[258:04.27]Wait, what are you... What's going on?
[258:12.45]Leave the lights off and investigate.
[258:14.91]Okay.
[258:21.22]Found it!
[258:28.32]Her phone is right here, but...
[258:34.50]Why am I doing this backwards?
[258:38.85]No, it's not that I'm blind.
[258:40.49]It's the fact that I thought I had to get the phone first.
[258:44.42]I thought I saved it before that one on the ground.
[258:46.74]I thought I had to do that one first again.
[258:48.66]So what was the point of even doing that?
[258:55.79]To get this crowbar.
[259:01.34]No, not blind or dumb.
[259:03.28]I thought of a save got fucked up, so I had to do that first one first.
[259:06.36]And then her cell phone's on the ground.
[259:07.66]I'm calling her cell phone that she's not going to pick up.
[259:10.14]It's on the ground.
[259:13.35]Upstairs rare books cage.
[259:16.03]You got it.
[259:26.06]I don't- I don't- I don't get to explain myself.
[259:28.90]Okay?
[259:30.74]I know, in my heart, what I was doing.
[259:33.70]In my heart of hearts.
[259:34.54]I don't- I don't explain myself.
[259:42.80]I don't even explain me.
[259:47.93]Can I open this?
[259:52.51]I can now.
[259:56.28]Wait, I want to go in the elevator.
[259:58.24]Oh, I wanted to go in the elevator party.
[259:59.92]That's not fair.
[260:03.04]He's just holding the gun at me.
[260:06.13]Eventually, can I open... Okay, I can call the elevator now.
[260:09.63]Is it going to take me up?
[260:14.29]I'm going to laugh if they're all dead.
[260:16.47]Just three bodies on the ground.
[260:22.59]Nope, they got out.
[260:32.49]Open up here, and they're all dead here.
[260:33.73]No, they seem to have all made it out.
[260:43.17]No, they are.
[260:48.72]Oh, so me... Me, um...
[261:09.17]Give me the gun.
[261:10.81]I didn't get the gun.
[261:16.81]Give me the gun.
[261:24.34]I honestly love how they all were just like, this guy was pretending to use this computer.
[261:33.08]I wish I could have listened in on their conversation for a little longer.
[261:35.10]That's unfortunate.
[261:37.22]Oh well.
[261:37.52]Give me the crowbar.
[261:38.78]Gotta go upstairs.
[261:49.00]Use the crowbar on this right?
[261:50.82]Yes!
[261:58.03]Oh, well that's...
[262:07.09]That did not hurt.
[262:10.61]You were better off just using the gun in the first place.
[262:17.17]You threw like a fucking bunch of trash at me and you had a gun with eight shots.
[262:26.89]Could have just shot the gun.
[262:31.02]That's alright though.
[262:37.50]Guys are all over the place.
[262:42.25]No, sawed off only, no, I don't want the sawed off.
[262:45.31]It's not gonna do me any favors.
[262:51.30]Now here's the Shelby reading room.
[262:53.36]Here's the young Sheldon reading room.
[262:57.84]The whole wide world was just a large dead sphere and then Sheldon made a knockoff TV show.
[263:06.39]the is this show popular at all it doesn't make any sense why do we need a spin-off is that show really that popular it can't be I don't it can't be that popular that they made another show based around that same universe
[263:37.56]Can I get in here with this?
[263:42.54]Oh, there she is.
[263:42.96]Okay.
[263:43.72]Well, how the fuck do I get up there?
[263:45.68]Can't just open this door?
[263:51.55]It's the most watched TV show in America.
[263:55.93]Now, is that by accident?
[263:58.01]Have they done a study on that yet?
[264:00.87]What percentage of people that are watching The Big Bang Theory have it turned on accidentally?
[264:16.74]Can I move this?
[264:20.85]I can.
[264:26.99]You know when you're watching an infomercial at like 4 o'clock in the morning and it's just on and you're not paying attention to it?
[264:31.73]I have to assume that the Big Bang Theory has the infomercial audience where it's just on and people forgot to turn their TVs off at like 9 o'clock.
[264:43.63]A bunch of old people.
[264:44.35]Like all your grandmothers did it.
[264:46.60]That's what like the 19 million people are.
[264:49.18]Jerk.
[264:49.46]He bit him.
[265:12.10]Did you get any of the blood sampled?
[265:13.62]I saw some hit the floor.
[265:15.12]Yes, sampled and transferred back to the lab.
[265:17.58]Excellent.
[265:21.22]Alright, now hack this computer.
[265:22.45]I can patch in through this computer and do a remote analysis.
[265:28.57]Bingo.
[265:29.75]Bazinga.
[265:31.55]There it is.
[265:32.39]This is the guy.
[265:34.47]This is our serial killer X. He killed the policeman, and he's been killing all of the other guys on your case list.
[265:41.14]What did he want with you?
[265:42.71]He wanted to know what we knew about the torturer.
[265:45.03]He made me look it up on the net.
[265:46.77]He knows the whole MO now.
[265:48.31]The abduction, torture, suicide thing.
[265:51.09]Thomas, the torturer is on your case list.
[265:54.29]She said the big bang.
[265:55.61]It's been cold since we ran into this serial killer X. X wants the torturer to die.
[266:01.69]He's hunting him down.
[266:04.53]Take a look at this.
[266:05.93]This is Jennifer Alden reporting
[266:08.01]Oh, God.
[266:08.29]What have I done?
[266:08.91]Of course it's a gym teacher.
[266:10.03]The internet exists back then?
[266:36.08]What does this take place?
[266:37.06]2001?
[266:37.12]Shouldn't even need HD.
[266:38.16]This is 480p, man.
[266:38.58]360p.
[266:38.62]Wouldn't even HD footage until 2008, at least.
[266:59.68]School and city district records are in the basement.
[267:03.16]Internet existed in 2000.
[267:05.36]What is that?
[267:05.78]Oh, well, hey, you can't just leave in the middle of a Sims build.
[267:13.79]Come on.
[267:15.79]Where's that bathroom gonna go?
[267:18.41]And make sure I get a good job.
[267:19.87]Because it's me and you.
[267:20.94]We made our life here.
[267:22.24]Oh, and now the fucking computer crashed.
[267:26.22]Need to get a new GPU.
[267:27.50]Make sure you save it.
[267:37.63]bad joke.
[267:39.11]No, it wasn't.
[267:41.23]That wasn't a bad joke.
[267:42.47]I'm sorry, guys.
[267:43.01]I'm going to have to disagree.
[267:46.81]I'm going to strongly disagree with you all.
[267:49.05]I can't sprint either.
[267:52.44]I didn't even see where she went.
[267:54.02]No, there she is.
[268:06.77]I can't move.
[268:07.83]Janitors.
[268:08.69]Keep this door locked at all times.
[268:11.53]That guy holding a bird?
[268:13.70]No, dude, that guy's holding like a PS4 controller.
[268:17.18]Wow.
[268:18.34]The Mayans were right.
[268:20.54]Look at this shit.
[268:21.08]This guy's holding a PS4 controller and this is in the fucking like 1700s?
[268:24.76]This technology's been around for a long time.
[268:29.08]Alright, let's go.
[268:42.00]Consistently good streamer makes consistently bad joke.
[268:44.94]That's not a bad joke.
[268:46.70]Very clearly the guy had a fucking PlayStation 4 controller in his hand.
[268:52.72]I'm not even making jokes.
[268:55.66]I'm making observations.
[268:58.39]Guys, I'm working on my portfolio.
[269:01.97]I write down every observation.
[269:05.49]In a journal.
[269:07.99]That journal is 10 feet deep at this point.
[269:13.70]You never know when you're going to need to, when you have to pull something out.
[269:18.28]If every single potential reference, I pull out my 10 feet deep book, I scroll through the pages, get to P for PlayStation, take the finger, scroll down, it's all in alphabetical order, and I find that reference.
[269:30.68]If somebody makes a PlayStation 4 reference, I can find it.
[269:33.95]It's in my glossary.
[269:38.27]She's going to die here.
[269:46.29]Alright, so can I just ditch her and go?
[269:50.03]Or do we have to wait?
[269:56.69]Stairwell down.
[269:57.77]Looking for a stairwell down.
[270:00.00]Watch out for the mutants.
[270:02.24]Does she fight with me?
[270:04.54]Or am I kind of on my own here?
[270:05.66]Did somebody just call me a nerd?
[270:13.22]Huh?
[270:14.20]What did you just call me?
[270:17.66]A nerd.
[270:20.10]Whoever that was.
[270:23.00]I want to know who they were.
[270:25.32]So I can take them off the line.
[270:28.54]Whoa!
[270:32.71]Oh, that hurt.
[270:35.03]That hurt.
[270:35.61]That hurt big time.
[270:39.61]Yeah.
[270:40.71]Yeah.
[270:41.41]Busted my flashlight, though.
[270:49.27]Mega Man glasses.
[270:51.09]Wait for Rosa.
[270:52.33]Ah, she found a way to trap me.
[270:55.77]This is where I get to watch her get her face ripped off.
[271:12.77]What?
[271:13.13]What?
[271:16.32]Okay, a weird skeleton's in the room with me.
[271:18.66]Wait, what?
[271:22.86]What are you doing?
[271:23.66]I already have a flashlight.
[271:25.26]I already have a flashlight.
[271:25.92]Okay.
[271:26.10]I'll be quick.
[271:26.44]Thanks for the help.
[271:27.78]There's a mummy.
[271:29.66]Rosa, did you see the mummy?
[271:53.37]Don't let him get away.
[271:57.41]I'm avoiding all the jump scares because I'm going way too fast for the game to know where I am.
[272:04.84]See?
[272:05.78]He's like trying to scare me.
[272:09.10]That was- I wasn't supposed to kill him right there.
[272:12.50]He was supposed to haunted house me for at least a minute or two.
[272:22.41]What does he want me to go?
[272:27.81]Haunted house?
[272:29.19]Alright, he killed his friend.
[272:33.69]Shit, how do I get out of here?
[272:36.55]This fucking maze.
[272:40.85]Am I going back the way that I came?
[272:41.99]I don't know, they're knocking books over.
[272:44.37]They're just making a mess.
[272:50.51]Wait, what?
[272:53.57]Do I just go down here?
[272:57.06]Thank god there's healing.
[272:58.86]Do I have a slab of concrete?
[273:00.30]I guess.
[273:00.54]I don't know if I want this.
[273:01.60]Oh well.
[273:01.78]We're gonna have to make do.
[273:28.73]Got him.
[273:30.93]Got him.
[273:33.17]No.
[273:33.79]No, you didn't.
[273:34.49]No.
[273:34.87]Sorry, dude.
[273:36.15]Not gonna happen like this.
[273:39.03]Which shelf is he on?
[273:43.32]Try to, like, scoop me up.
[273:45.40]Ain't gonna happen.
[273:45.96]Is that her?
[273:53.28]No.
[273:57.53]Thankfully, these guys are very weak.
[273:59.97]They die very, very easily.
[274:01.45]What does this guy have on him?
[274:05.30]Wait.
[274:06.90]Oh shit, man.
[274:07.54]You had a nice gun.
[274:10.82]I will alleviate you of this burden.
[274:15.52]Although, we're going to flip this around because these guys die in one hit.
[274:18.60]So why would I waste it?
[274:25.34]Where are you going?
[274:27.49]I... Why did I do that?
[274:31.11]I didn't even need to do that.
[274:32.19]Why did I shoot him?
[274:34.57]I didn't need to fire the weapon.
[274:37.67]The trapeze artist that fell down, I didn't need to do that.
[274:40.78]Ay-yi-yi.
[274:44.86]That guy was showing me his human spider imitation.
[274:51.45]There's a new gun.
[274:53.43]Flip it around.
[274:55.17]Don't shoot these guys.
[274:56.11]They're so easy to kill.
[275:03.02]A lot of random shit.
[275:06.18]Well, now it's time to... We're gonna let this play out.
[275:24.73]Well, we're all stupid.
[275:27.45]I'm as dumb as they are.
[275:31.79]Oh, come on.
[275:37.52]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[275:39.16]Both of those went left and right.
[275:40.72]No, that one, look at that one.
[275:42.08]That one was supposed to go through.
[275:43.86]They both were supposed to go through.
[275:45.84]Apparently you can't shoot through that.
[275:52.46]Don't give me that shit, game.
[275:53.82]Get out of here.
[276:04.39]There's no bullets in that.
[276:13.74]Alright, move.
[276:17.76]Nothing in here?
[276:18.44]What?
[276:21.70]Why is that open?
[276:22.88]Hold on, am I going crazy?
[276:24.92]Or is there actually nothing in here?
[276:30.92]There's a piece of metal.
[276:35.89]Why are these guys all so aggressive?
[276:39.67]Well, the better question is, why are they even here in the first place?
[276:46.90]None of these people should even be down here.
[276:48.68]This is like cold storage.
[276:57.49]Did you have to deal with a bunch of random hobos and aliens?
[277:00.27]I don't think so.
[277:02.95]Easy for you to say.
[277:05.47]What the hell was that?
[277:08.37]Are they gonna...
[277:22.62]Okay, well, let's go.
[277:25.82]Mario Brothers did everything this did, but better.
[277:31.18]Yeah.
[277:33.52]It sure did.
[277:34.36]Super Mario is a way better version of this game.
[277:39.65]I really love the part in Mario when you bash people's heads in with a pipe.
[277:42.69]That's weird.
[277:50.13]Alright.
[277:50.49]There he is.
[278:09.52]spying on he's been just barely a step ahead of us the whole game a lot of Carl Andersons but I bet this is our guy he was enrolled or sentenced to an educational rehabilitation center for the severely troubled saint Joseph secondary on northeast 52nd and Fremont it's been closed for five years no wonder that's one of the worst parts of town Christ the cops have just been letting it go to hell for years
[278:32.66]Sonic did the same thing Mario did, but better.
[278:34.74]Yes.
[278:34.84]Sonic... How would you know that?
[278:35.70]You wouldn't know that that was him.
[279:03.78]I think he just said something really, really mean.
[279:05.80]Is she just in there?
[279:07.92]Is she blocked in?
[279:13.06]Easy, guy behind me.
[279:27.94]That is so brutal, that cut sound.
[279:29.87]Alright, where is she?
[279:32.31]Doesn't she have a gun or something?
[279:42.44]She's gonna get scooped up.
[279:43.49]It's gonna be brutal.
[279:48.11]Meet her at the exit.
[279:49.25]Uh, yeah, she's the one that's following me.
[279:51.17]What about our serial killer, Axe?
[279:52.71]He's got the same information we do, so that means he's also gonna go to the school.
[279:56.60]Perhaps I can catch two killers with one net.
[279:59.28]I'll drive you there, then head back to HQ and work on that faculty list.
[280:02.56]We're gonna go to school.
[280:04.44]My favorite.
[280:06.21]I'm gonna slow-mo this just because you know it's coming.
[280:09.05]My favorite PUBG level.
[280:13.79]And then, like, you can speed that up and it'll sound normal.
[280:17.62]So, like, my favorite PUBG level.
[280:19.18]But, like, if I say it like that, rewind it, and make it, speed it up, and it'll sound normal.
[280:23.87]It's cool how science works.
[280:25.03]Did somebody say grilled cheese?
[280:33.89]No.
[280:34.71]Uh, in fact, speaking of grilled cheese, I may, uh, I think that's gonna be where I'm gonna call it for tonight.
[280:45.00]How long have we been streaming for?
[280:45.98]Just about five hours?
[280:49.41]I am enjoying this game, though.
[280:50.82]I'm having a lot of fun.
[280:54.10]We have 1-2 in PUBG.
[281:02.07]We'll just get here and save it.
[281:08.88]This guy appeared out of nowhere.
[281:10.34]It's going as well as it can be.
[281:12.26]Why did you have to mention grilled cheese?
[281:14.08]How did you know where to find me?
[281:14.95]That guy ended the stream.
[281:16.59]Just a coincidence.
[281:18.09]Saw you from across the street.
[281:20.47]I have x-ray vision.
[281:21.29]I saw you through the building.
[281:22.77]Coincidence?
[281:23.99]I don't know what your game is here, Van Horn, but I've got a job to do.
[281:26.94]If you'll excuse me.
[281:36.59]Did I fall in?
[281:38.25]That was very loud.
[281:42.75]He pushed me in.
[281:44.22]He shoved me in after I said that.
[281:48.82]Alright, guys.
[281:52.62]I'm going to quit.
[281:55.22]We will continue this tomorrow.
[281:57.70]I actually really am enjoying Condemned.
[282:00.31]So let's see.
[282:00.93]I have... How many screenshots do I have?
[282:04.11]Does it say how many?
[282:07.94]Let's count here.
[282:08.54]3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.
[282:11.78]Mm-hmm.
[282:25.52]I have 66 screenshots.
[282:29.26]I had escaped 66 times.
[282:30.75]If you were curious.
[282:33.19]And they're all of the menu.
[282:35.09]There's one that's not the menu.
[282:37.05]It's me holding a gun.
[282:38.97]Don't ask me how.
[282:42.11]It's just random times of me holding a gun.
[282:48.73]These pictures aren't even that bad.
[282:52.92]I'd put these somewhere.
[282:57.15]Thank you everybody for watching.
[282:58.77]I really appreciate it.
[282:59.90]We're going to read some bits that I missed earlier.
[283:05.66]Tomorrow, we're going to pick up right where we left off.
[283:08.58]We're going to try to complete Condemned because it's cool.
[283:12.90]It's fun.
[283:13.88]Having a good time.
[283:15.44]And I think we probably only have like another four or five hours in Condemned anyways, so we'll get another stream out of it.
[283:23.65]And then on Saturday, because we're going Saturday as well, we're going to be building a fucking PC on stream, guys.
[283:33.68]Because I'm going Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week.
[283:36.62]So we'll finish Condemned tomorrow.
[283:37.80]And then we're going to be building a PC on Saturday.
[283:41.56]Probably earlier than... I'm not going to do a late 8, 9 plus o'clock stream on Saturday.
[283:48.16]It'll probably end up being earlier.
[283:50.47]But... Should be interesting.
[283:53.29]Be there or be square.
[283:55.85]And if you're taking off now, good night.
[283:57.61]Thanks for sticking around.
[283:59.27]And let's go back and catch up on some of these bits.
[284:01.95]Not very many, because I did most of them in the middle of that stream there, but let's go for it.
[284:06.29]Here we go.
[284:07.25]Captain Magic, thank you for the $5.
[284:08.39]It just says, Rip Cheer, Rip Cheer.
[284:14.76]Thank you, Captain Magic.
[284:16.54]Amber Berries, thank you for the $7.
[284:17.46]Hey, Jerva, I've been a long-term, long-term fan of yours.
[284:23.06]It's my birthday.
[284:23.82]Can I get a shout-out?
[284:25.84]Amberberries, happy birthday.
[284:27.72]It's $7.
[284:29.68]Thank you for your $7.
[284:30.96]Happy birthday.
[284:32.17]Hope it's a great one.
[284:34.57]Hopefully you get a ton of cake and shit.
[284:36.31]Hopefully you get a lot of cool stuff.
[284:38.93]Hopefully you get a super soaker.
[284:42.17]And not one of the new super soakers.
[284:43.55]I'm talking about one of the old ones.
[284:44.41]You had to pump a shitload.
[284:46.48]And you'd get to a point where you were scared that it might explode.
[284:50.36]You guys remember Super Soakers when you, like, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, and it got to a point where it was so hard to do it that you actually were in fear that it might explode in your hands.
[285:05.02]I remember that.
[285:06.52]And then you would, it would hurt the person you squirted.
[285:10.92]It was like a beam of death that would hit them in the arm, and it was like, ah, shit!
[285:16.16]That's the kind of Super Soaker I'm talking about.
[285:17.50]Hopefully, hopefully, they're gonna bring those back.
[285:19.72]What happened to those?
[285:23.22]Anyways, thank you.
[285:24.58]Asha108, thank you for the $15.
[285:27.72]jermaMars.
[285:28.76]There's a link here, but I don't click links.
[285:31.98]I do not click donation links just in case it's something fucking weird or terrible.
[285:37.62]Thank you, though, for the $15.
[285:38.94]jermaMars.
[285:39.68]Appreciate it.
[285:40.61]Thank you, Asha.
[285:42.65]Harvey Birdman, thank you for the $2.50.
[285:44.65]When are we getting the QuickTime song on iTunes?
[285:48.77]Are you referring to
[285:51.08]That video I made like three years ago?
[285:55.12]Where you're the guy that rides with your pant legs stuck in the motorcycle?
[286:00.10]You are, aren't you?
[286:01.28]Well, the answer is never.
[286:04.80]It's a good meme.
[286:06.16]Please do it.
[286:06.76]Oh, it's a Drake meme.
[286:08.27]Alright, I'll do it.
[286:10.81]Is it a Drake meme?
[286:14.05]Okay, it's...
[286:18.50]Alright, that's a Gatorade though, you got this wrong!
[286:26.10]This is wrong!
[286:27.20]This is supposed to be, the top image is supposed to be like a fresh pressed juice, not a Gatorade.
[286:33.08]The bottom one is good, the top one is not supposed to be a Gatorade.
[286:43.01]That's like my, I like it though, good job.
[286:46.77]That is an A-.
[286:49.73]I give you an A-.
[286:51.23]Definitely better than a B+.
[286:52.35]That's an A-.
[286:54.73]Thank you, though.
[286:55.97]That was Asha that did that.
[286:59.44]Glazed Donut, thank you for the $1.
[287:00.92]Jerma, come to Texas and eat Whataburger.
[287:03.06]They're literally the best fast food establishment ever created.
[287:05.62]They have unironically good food.
[287:07.08]Well, hold on a minute there.
[287:09.40]When we're talking about fast food with our previous conversation, we're describing...
[287:17.02]I determine the plate because I go the Whataburger is not a huge huge massive ridiculous chain We're talking like at least three to four thousand restaurants is what I determined to be like the fast food chains the typical ones there are like There were like 19,000 McDonald's in the world.
[287:34.78]How many other?
[287:35.20]There's like probably 26,000 McDonald's how many?
[287:40.50]McDonald's are there in the world?
[287:45.87]There are 68 million McDonald's.
[287:47.45]No, never mind.
[287:48.05]That's a... Hold on.
[287:49.91]McDonald's... I got that wrong.
[287:52.59]There are... They serve 68 million customers every day.
[287:56.60]There are 36,899 McDonald's restaurants.
[288:02.80]There are 37,000 McDonald's.
[288:06.92]There are more McDonald's restaurants than there are people in Denmark.
[288:12.20]Right?
[288:12.58]What's the population of Denmark?
[288:14.83]Denmark population.
[288:20.46]Six million.
[288:21.52]No.
[288:21.88]How many people are in Rhode Island?
[288:25.24]Rhode Island population.
[288:29.06]A million.
[288:29.64]Okay.
[288:31.86]How many people are in Iceland?
[288:34.48]Iceland population.
[288:39.86]This has got to be like less than 500,000.
[288:42.74]Okay, so there's 334,000 people that live in Iceland, okay?
[288:48.24]There are, if Iceland was McDonald's, there would be 30% of every human would live in a McDonald's that lived in Iceland.
[288:58.03]Okay, I'm reaching here.
[288:59.51]You understand what I'm saying?
[289:00.59]There were 37,000 restaurants.
[289:04.75]On the flip side, how many Whataburgers are there?
[289:10.88]How many Whataburgers are there in the world?
[289:16.18]Oh, let's see.
[289:18.88]Okay, so there are 760 Whataburgers in the world.
[289:23.08]You compare that with 37,000 McDonald's, that's what I'm talking about.
[289:27.74]I'm talking about like, Whataburger is still a very small chain that's not really all over the place.
[289:34.20]It's only in 10 states in America.
[289:37.62]I can't get what like the Whataburger is only in like the south so when I'm when we have the fast food debate we're talking about like restaurants that have like thousands of restaurants anyways um a little off track there but thank you thank you for the I just I where the hell is it I just missed it where is it why is it gone

[290:21.02]You're the only thing that has helped me this week other than my suppositories.
[290:24.99]Well, dude, it sucks.
[290:28.97]Hopefully you feel better.
[290:30.25]Hopefully that's something that, you know, you're on the right medication.
[290:35.83]Guys, it's not cool.
[290:36.95]It's not fun.
[290:38.67]I've been there before.
[290:39.69]It's not cool.
[290:42.59]Hopefully you get that situated and taken care of.
[290:46.59]Thank you for the $5.
[290:47.21]Appreciate it.
[290:50.34]Thank you, Nock, for the $1.
[290:52.62]Jerma set up a Patreon already.
[290:53.92]I don't like paying those pieces of shit at Amazon to be able to donate.
[290:59.30]By the way, please keep playing these classics.
[291:00.88]New games suck.
[291:02.64]We had that proven to us when we tried to play Assassin's Creed.
[291:06.27]This was supposed to be an Assassin's Creed Origins game.
[291:08.71]Came out in 2017.
[291:10.32]Brand new release from a major publisher.
[291:14.16]And the game just wouldn't work.
[291:17.20]It just can't be captured for some reason on my computer.
[291:19.42]I don't know why.
[291:20.00]And a game that came out in fucking 2005 can be captured.
[291:23.88]I don't know how that happens.
[291:24.94]I don't know if it's a weird thing.
[291:26.82]Maybe my driver or something going on with it.
[291:28.62]Who knows?
[291:31.06]But, yeah.
[291:31.70]Thank you, Nock.
[291:33.34]The answer to your question is soon.
[291:35.24]I'm going to be... There's a video that we're making to... Because I don't just want to set up a Patreon and be like, hey, here's a Patreon.
[291:43.43]Do it.
[291:44.31]There's going to be a video that makes a joke about Patreon and it's going to be the Patreon video.
[291:53.31]So it's going to be its own video.
[291:56.21]Not necessarily just, hey, it's open.
[291:57.77]Hey, go.
[291:58.77]Go.
[291:59.31]Donate.
[292:00.70]There'll be like a video there for you to watch.
[292:02.64]So it should be interesting.
[292:04.72]At least I hope it is.
[292:07.44]Joke incoming.
[292:08.12]Yeah, like soon.
[292:10.32]But thank you.
[292:11.28]Peekaflair, thanks for the $1.

[292:25.35]FutureboundTV, thanks for the $5.
[292:27.82]Are we ever going to get more Wonder Book games?
[292:29.44]I wish we could, but they no longer exist.
[292:33.06]I played every single Wonder Book game.
[292:35.46]There's one that I didn't make a video on, and it was this one called, like, Nightcrawler.
[292:40.86]It was literally a children's book.
[292:44.00]You didn't do anything.
[292:44.86]There was no real interaction.
[292:46.44]You just watched a children's book.
[292:50.72]There was nothing there to really play with, so that's why I didn't make a video on that one.
[292:56.29]But thank you, FutureBoundTV.
[292:59.91]Um... Captain Magic, thank you for the $10.
[293:02.17]You have some bad jokes, but take my bits anyways.
[293:05.81]Come on.
[293:08.38]Come on.
[293:09.76]Let me go through my almanac and find, like, the one joke I need to make for this.

[293:45.46]Uh, boring.
[293:47.48]Okay, here we go.
[293:48.04]Boring.
[293:49.54]Uh, you think you're bored now?
[293:51.55]No.
[293:53.23]Get a load of this, and then I throw a grenade down into the ground, and it blows up, and I go flying.
[294:01.36]It's in there somewhere.
[294:03.20]Whatever.
[294:03.80]It's in there, like, deep in there.

[298:01.76]I don't know what you thought of the other Assassin's Creed games, but I've got 20 hours in Origins, and it's definitely the best in the franchise.
[298:07.96]That's what I've heard.
[298:08.76]I've heard it's more of an actual action game.
[298:12.30]It's an open world action RPG game, not a run on roofs and dive into hay and follow people around.
[298:20.61]Every mission.
[298:23.35]I don't like Assassin's Creed.
[298:24.49]Why did I buy Assassin's Creed Origins?
[298:28.24]Don't ask me why.
[298:28.82]I have no idea.
[298:30.80]But it does look like it's fairly interesting, and I did want to play it.
[298:34.03]And hopefully they patch it or something.
[298:35.25]Because I would love to play it.
[298:42.01]Good question.
[298:44.77]Combine, thank you for the $5 earlier.
[298:48.64]Definitely take time to learn the combat controls, please.
[298:51.32]Also, do not hype this game up too much, but it's actually really good.
[298:54.92]He's referring to Assassin's Creed.
[298:57.48]Our six minutes in it.
[299:01.16]I was going to, and then everyone told me that the stream was lagging, and I was like, what?
[299:04.64]Hey, what the heck, man?
[299:06.69]But thank you, Combine.
[299:10.77]Zarbon, our Zarbonific.

[299:17.25]Well, thank you.
[299:18.55]I actually was going to go get one of those this weekend.
[299:21.65]Because I just keep seeing people play Odyssey.
[299:23.95]It just looks too good.
[299:26.35]It looks like there's so much fun stuff to do in that game.
[299:31.23]And aren't people saying that it is the best Mario game to ever be made?
[299:34.46]A lot of people are using that term.
[299:41.10]But yeah, thank you.
[299:44.22]Uh, StixRenegade, thanks for the dollar.
[299:46.22]Zumbini time, download it now.

[299:57.67]I promise.
[299:59.65]Uh, Heretic Anchorite, thanks for the $1.
[300:01.57]Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God.

[300:06.27]Nope, this is another song.
[300:09.65]Thank you for the $1.
[300:10.15]I don't read songs.
[300:12.85]I sing them.

[300:22.46]Uh, BLB24, thanks for the $1.
[300:23.82]Loving you play open world games.
[300:27.44]Open world games are some of my favorite games to exist.
[300:30.72]It's one of my favorite genres or types of... Linear games are fun.
[300:36.60]I like the linear... I mean, obviously, we're playing one right now in Condemned.
[300:40.10]It's a linear game.
[300:42.23]But open world, just having the freedom to kind of go wherever you want and do whatever you want is my favorite thing.
[300:51.95]Butterfingers, thanks for the $1.
[300:53.39]Hey, buy yourself some frames.
[300:58.87]I did.
[300:59.13]I did.
[301:00.79]Sixfish11, thanks for the $1.
[301:02.13]Will you play the new TF2 update eventually?
[301:04.61]I don't know.
[301:04.91]I don't want to say anything.
[301:05.89]I don't want to be like, I wanted to play it, but Halloween kind of got in the way.
[301:10.33]I don't know.
[301:13.15]I don't know.
[301:14.55]I might just turn it on randomly one day.
[301:17.43]But I don't have, like, the urge to play Team Fortress.
[301:19.97]I don't, like, think I'm going to play it.
[301:22.28]It could happen.
[301:23.10]Some just randomly... You've seen some of these streams, how fucked up they get, where I'm just like, oh, like today.
[301:29.58]It could have, like, happened today.
[301:32.28]Just because getting thrown that curveball of Assassin's Creed just absolutely not being streamable in, like, the first five minutes of opening it.
[301:39.25]So...
[301:42.37]We'll see.
[301:43.43]I'm not going to be like, get ready for TF2!
[301:45.43]If I'm going to play it, I'm going to play it.
[301:50.94]And I think... I think that is... I think I caught up with it.
[302:00.64]Except for Squall gave me a dollar and said, petition to change your name to Germajesty.
[302:04.70]Well, I don't know why, but... Why would I change my name?
[302:11.38]Did I get set-em-up Joe from earlier?
[302:15.04]Yeah.
[302:15.46]Set-em-up Joe, thanks for the five bucks.
[302:17.58]Here's some money, sweet internet man.

[302:30.17]And... I believe... I believe... that gets us... No, we got a few more here.

[306:20.81]We're trying to get stuff off the ground.
[306:23.75]And a lot of it has to do with me.
[306:27.35]Trying to figure out what I want to do and what I have time to do and what he wants to do.
[306:32.30]But I don't think that's on the cards right now at all.
