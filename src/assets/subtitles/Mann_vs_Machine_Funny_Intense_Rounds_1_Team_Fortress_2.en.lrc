[00:02.12]Alrighty, how are you doing fellas?
[00:03.26]This is Team Fortress 2, and it's a particular round I handpicked from our games of Man vs. Machine, the new survival game mode, introduced to TF2.
[00:12.21]I'm playing as the Medic, and if you're unfamiliar with this game mode, you have no idea what's going on.
[00:16.17]It's very basically, we're defending our point from a bunch of robots who are carrying a bomb, and between the six of us, we need to devise a good set of class balance and teamwork to stop them from reaching that point.
[00:27.60]This round was hilarious when we were playing it.
[00:29.56]So I hope you enjoy, thanks for watching, and goodbye for now.
[00:34.73]Well, while she's on your left, be careful, Kevin.
[00:36.85]Oh, no.
[00:38.91]So is the soldier.
[00:40.63]Oh, boy.
[00:41.67]I'm just hiding in this cubbyhole, just taking pot shots at him.
[00:45.48]Oh, yeah.

[04:20.70]So, hope you enjoyed, and I'll catch you soon.
[04:23.94]Goodbye.
