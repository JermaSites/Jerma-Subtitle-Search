[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.05]But that would be you lying.
[00:02.67]You understand?
[00:05.09]Dude, the two best things at BlizzCon were World of Warcraft Classic, something they did more than a decade ago, and Warcraft 3 Remastered, a 16-year-old game.
[00:22.88]And the third best thing is that Mike Morhaime stepped down before the company turned into a dogshit show.
[00:28.53]Oh my god.
[00:30.16]Oh, dude, the mic is hot, man.
[00:32.98]The mic is hot.
[00:33.88]You got a hot mic.
[00:36.16]What the fuck?
[00:37.20]Oh, dude.
[00:39.12]Everybody's heard you say that.
[00:40.60]Oh, my God.
[00:45.03]So this is hot bod.
[00:47.91]No, hot mic.
[00:48.85]Oh, hi, guys.
[00:55.39]You know who this is.
[00:56.03]Sometimes it really be like that.
[01:00.98]Yeah, well, we're not playing a Blizzard game right now.
[01:04.68]We're playing another game.
[01:08.88]You know how when you're a sweaty tryhard and you get gamer gunk on your controller?
[01:14.33]Oh, I know that.
[01:15.51]Tell me about it, man.
[01:16.33]I know all about that.
[01:17.15]I have about three inches of gunk on this controller from all the Soul Calibur I've played.
[01:21.19]It is disgusting.
[01:23.64]I mean, at what point do you just put that under water and, like, shake it around with, like, soap and stuff?
[01:27.44]Well, I stopped using it because I got a different one.
[01:30.38]But now that I, like, because I have to use this one for Lethal League, I've gone back to it and it's like, wow.
[01:36.15]I, uh... I think I could spread a disease.
[01:39.95]I think this could be ground zero.
[01:41.25]Oh my god.
[01:45.46]What even is gamer gunk?
[01:46.94]Like, it's disgusting.
[01:48.00]Is it like sweat that just cakes on over like years of time?
[01:51.60]Years?
[01:52.04]This took a few days.
[01:56.86]Yeah, but it wasn't... You didn't have gamer... That was like years.
[02:01.11]These are my excretions.
[02:05.33]I like shake your hand.
[02:06.95]I don't like that.
[02:09.29]Well, you know what?
[02:10.80]If we shook hands for like a day, you'd get all my excretions.
[02:16.03]But I think one shake isn't enough.
[02:20.88]Did you make a tweet yet?
[02:22.24]I don't tweet anything.
[02:24.46]You don't ever tweet about your story?
[02:25.92]Yeah, I should, honestly, because people have been asking me, like, every time I look at my chat for the past week, it has said, did you know Lethal League?
[02:34.42]Well, apparently you are Stetabs.
[02:37.30]Lethal League with Stetabs, then maybe Red Dead 2.
[02:40.93]What?
[02:42.33]I don't know what happened.
[02:45.95]lead the league with step abs I don't know well then you're gonna be Jerm babs alright let's move this over here are you like do you even do like an intro anymore or do you just say like who cares play what is what is what is it like now like how are you um I gave up a long time ago
[03:13.35]Let's go this way.
[03:15.97]Okay.
[03:17.53]Hey everybody, welcome to the stream for another edition of Wacky Wednesday where we check out the latest, goofiest games.
[03:23.41]Today, Lethally.
[03:26.94]And boy is this one wacky.
[03:29.08]Oh, I burnt my mouth.
[03:33.50]Ooh!
[03:34.14]Okay, are you ready?
[03:37.98]So, how do you... We just did a test.
[03:41.92]We did it just to make sure it works, you know?
[03:44.71]We did it.
[03:46.27]And then you left the game and I have to do it again.
[03:48.65]Are you ready?
[03:50.85]Are you in the game?
[03:51.41]I'm ready.
[03:52.37]I'm ready to be joined.
[03:54.75]Should I give the rundown of what Lethal League is?
[03:58.25]You know what?
[03:59.63]Go for it, Tommy Thickles.
[04:02.25]Okay, so Lethal League is a series of back and forth.
[04:06.69]It's a never-ending struggle between two forces.
[04:09.40]You've got the red team versus the blue team.
[04:11.50]The question is, who will survive?
[04:14.44]Well, nobody dies here.
[04:15.34]Everyone lives.
[04:15.90]It's just a game of back and forth and never-ending struggle ball.
[04:19.92]You've got blue team versus red team.
[04:22.09]I'm on the blue team, he's on the red team.
[04:24.29]And there's a ball that signifies a spherical entity.
[04:29.67]And it goes back and forth between the two.
[04:32.18]Never end, just press pause.
[04:35.24]I was waiting for the story.
[04:37.62]There is no story.
[04:38.64]It's called I Just Woke Up.
[04:41.80]You wake up at 3 p.m., 2 p.m.?
[04:44.00]No, wait, it's 1.30.
[04:44.48]I didn't just wake up.
[04:45.48]Okay, okay.
[04:48.79]I don't know how time zones work.
[04:49.89]Also, you drink hot coffee in the desert?
[04:53.45]Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[04:54.77]You don't drink iced coffee?
[04:58.37]I- look, it's- you save money.
[04:59.95]I play ping pong.
[05:01.25]You save money if you drink- if you make your own coffee.
[05:03.29]Like, I used to just drink a Dunkin' Donuts every day.
[05:05.11]Go ahead, keep doing that.
[05:08.03]By the way, if you guys didn't know what this game was, it's a back and forth between two struggling places.
[05:13.05]And whoever gets hit first is the one that gets their health taken away.
[05:19.01]You're not gonna get that one, I'm sorry.
[05:22.27]It's about two struggling forces.
[05:24.01]It's so confusing when it's that fast and you can also make it go through walls.
[05:29.65]Yeah.
[05:30.49]So everyone's got a special ability.
[05:33.35]His special ability is being a fucking cheater.
[05:38.07]What's that?
[05:38.39]Is that a smash ball?
[05:39.19]Smash ball!
[05:39.61]Smash ball!
[05:40.17]It's a smash ball!
[05:42.26]Oh yeah, they added power-ups.
[05:43.92]What the fuck?
[05:45.18]I don't know what that is.
[05:45.82]What does that do?
[05:48.32]Oh.
[05:48.46]Oh.
[05:49.87]Oh my god.
[05:56.58]I don't understand what it's doing.
[05:57.90]It's your superpower where it's going through walls.
[06:01.22]And now you know how confusing it is.
[06:04.48]Come on Tommy.
[06:07.94]Jesus Christ, I hate that ability.
[06:11.60]What even- what is your- ow.
[06:13.44]Mine, like, curbs it, and it's- it's not- it's not anything.
[06:17.03]What- what is- what does yours do?
[06:19.11]Like, it just- I mean, it curbs it.
[06:21.51]Show it to me.
[06:22.75]Show the people that- Alright, that was- that was the best special in the game.
[06:25.99]What are you talking about?
[06:29.28]Ow.
[06:31.86]Oh!
[06:34.90]He's reading the summary of the Lord of the Rings book.
[06:42.38]One to find them, one to bind them, and one to sign them.
[06:47.12]I'm not sure how the speed of the ball affects hit damage.
[06:54.48]Oh, fuck.
[06:55.34]Oh my god, oh my god.
[06:56.28]Oh yeah, and you can hit the people's dead bodies.
[07:00.16]Very important.
[07:01.80]Oh, that's right.
[07:02.86]Oh my god.
[07:03.86]But just for real though, if you don't know what this game is...
[07:10.02]I'm playing by myself.
[07:11.08]Oh
[07:22.75]Red is a communist China.
[07:25.07]That's why my ping pong paddle... Wait, did you win?
[07:27.39]Yeah, I killed you.
[07:28.55]Alright, now that we can explain what the game is.
[07:30.59]So, if you don't know what the game is... For the next hour, you're gonna explain what the game is.
[07:35.48]I just spilled fucking coffee.
[07:36.88]I just got this fucking room.
[07:39.20]I just got this room and I spilled coffee all over it.
[07:42.38]God damn it.
[07:44.12]Well, did it get on like that nice walnut desk?
[07:48.28]Oh no, I'm good.
[07:50.48]We're good.
[07:50.80]He only lost because he spilled his coffee.
[07:57.95]Who are these other characters?
[08:00.17]Should I be Crocodile Dundee?
[08:02.59]You used to like Crocodile Dundee.
[08:04.83]Did I?
[08:05.13]What is his special?
[08:06.05]I don't remember, but I know he can hang on the walls.
[08:11.38]Oh shit, it did get on the desk.
[08:12.28]Hold on.
[08:13.06]I have a coaster here specifically for this.
[08:14.84]I gotta take my shirt off.
[08:15.60]Oh my god.
[08:17.91]Is this a webcam shirt off Jerma stream?
[08:20.99]No shirt?
[08:21.53]No, it's called really like I spilled on my walnut desk.
[08:26.77]How much did you pay for your walnut desk?
[08:28.97]It was at least like $400.
[08:33.36]It's a beautiful walnut desk.
[08:36.24]Don't swing that at me.
[08:37.34]I know you're gonna do it.
[08:41.01]Okay, that's good.
[08:42.31]I can put it back on the coaster.
[08:43.35]I'm gonna wash this again later.
[08:44.71]I'm gonna wash it.
[08:47.93]Okay, now I got coffee all over me.
[08:50.68]Hold on, give me one more second.
[08:55.49]It's about two fighting nations.
[08:57.41]Oh yeah, he like eats it.
[08:59.31]His is really good too.
[09:00.25]That curve is pretty good.
[09:09.42]I just heard you.
[09:10.28]I just heard you being me.
[09:17.14]You're gonna die, dude.
[09:29.68]I had my catcher's mitt out.
[09:33.26]Oh my god.
[09:33.77]What was that?
[09:34.19]Did you just block?
[09:36.43]If you attack at the same time, sometimes you double hit it.
[09:42.41]What did I say nice for?
[09:43.71]Oh, there's an emo button.
[09:45.07]I don't remember what it is.
[09:52.84]Ooh, nice throw.
[09:55.34]Oh, I thought I had it.
[09:58.67]Fucking Tommy Pickles.
[09:59.69]Burst 5.
[10:02.51]Whoa, that was weird.
[10:03.27]That was a weird one.
[10:08.87]That is so strange when you do that.
[10:13.81]Oh my god.
[10:17.40]Uh-oh.
[10:20.90]Wow!
[10:21.44]What's the button?
[10:23.44]It's... I don't know.
[10:24.32]I want that to be my thing on my stream.
[10:26.38]I'm not gonna tell you.
[10:30.72]You always were a frickin' selfish lover.
[10:32.88]Oh my god!
[10:40.39]You've been practicing!
[10:49.02]Wouldn't it be cool if Blizzard announced this game instead of Diablo Immortal?
[10:55.21]and then Lethal League Blaze had a player base.
[10:58.07]Well, another funny joke you could make is if Valve bought this company and then put it out again.
[11:03.15]What happened to PC gaming?
[11:04.41]What happened to it?
[11:05.13]Dude, I was saying this the other day.
[11:06.49]2019 and beyond, get ready for the weird times where Valve is going to start releasing better games than Blizzard.
[11:16.46]It's about to happen.
[11:17.46]You heard it.
[11:18.98]This is a new character?
[11:20.28]I'll try this character.
[11:21.42]I messed with her in training.
[11:22.50]She puts the ball in a bubble and slows it down, and then when it wears off, it speeds up again.
[11:28.84]Oh, that's cool.
[11:33.04]For those of you Jermamites on the Jerma side here, I've got a couple of absence for you here.
[11:38.87]After playing Lethal League, I'm going to give you some updates on the green screen.
[11:42.01]Those of you Jermamites that are here on the Jerma channel...
[11:45.57]Oh, my God.
[11:46.37]What the hell?
[11:47.27]Yeah, it does a weird slow thing.
[11:49.99]It has, like, three phases to it.
[11:52.31]Wow.
[11:52.77]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[11:57.50]I got it.
[11:58.80]I got it.
[11:59.38]I got it.
[12:00.26]I got it.
[12:01.86]Why did I just do... I got it.
[12:05.38]I got it.
[12:07.00]I got it.
[12:11.28]That just was... Ooh.
[12:18.14]Oh my god, that throw is actually pretty nifty.
[12:20.94]Oh, how did you catch that?
[12:21.82]I just went the wrong way.
[12:24.18]I swung the wrong fucking way.
[12:30.58]Did I get hit by that?
[12:31.58]Yeah.
[12:41.01]Oh, smash ball!
[12:41.57]Smash ball!
[12:43.81]What the heck?
[12:44.21]Come on, give it to me!
[12:45.89]Ooh, curved it in!
[12:46.55]Actually just homing missile it in.
[12:50.67]I'm Satan!
[12:51.41]I'm Satan!
[12:51.87]I don't know.
[12:53.61]What does it do?
[12:54.21]I don't know.
[12:54.93]I think I'm Satan.
[12:55.95]Is it?
[12:56.95]Oh, I think it changes to... What the fuck?
[12:59.93]Yeah, that's actually pretty stupid.
[13:02.17]I thought it was a really dumb power.
[13:03.98]But once you get that fast... No, it's my ball.
[13:13.88]What am I doing?
[13:14.48]I'm like throwing confetti at you.
[13:16.22]What the fuck am I doing?
[13:17.57]You're dying.
[13:20.55]Oh, God.
[13:21.17]Not for long.
[13:23.55]Alright.
[13:24.59]Let's bring this to the stratosphere.
[13:29.65]Oh, my God.
[13:30.43]Oh, my God.
[13:34.69]Some of this I saw in the sewer stage.
[13:36.56]If you get the ball a certain speed, like a monster comes out of the sewer in the background.
[13:40.24]Oh, really?
[13:40.90]That's pretty cool.
[13:42.72]Oh, my fucking God.
[13:43.46]That was the easiest thing ever.
[13:44.38]I just lost it, buddy.
[13:58.48]I'm doing it the wrong way every time.
[14:05.10]Fucking god damn it.
[14:06.87]I'm a football player.
[14:12.11]Oh, that's weird.
[14:12.77]Oh, that's real weird.
[14:16.51]I don't like that.
[14:19.91]Watch out!
[14:29.06]I don't know where it is!
[14:35.12]These old man eyes.
[14:43.49]I think for the sake of how things used to be, back in the good old days, the oldster, the old Jerma, I think we have to make a bet.
[14:53.99]Oh no.
[14:55.01]If you win, I'll stop DDoSing you.
[15:02.33]Oh my god.
[15:07.02]That's like... That's like, that's too close to hold it right now.
[15:19.76]I want to be the yellow guy.
[15:21.16]What about if I win?
[15:24.00]you just if no if okay if alright if you let's go to the the the pad room give me give me like a round to think about that because you just you just gave me like well then this round no it's not we have to get like five warm-up rounds okay you gotta learn the game actually like on second thought oh I mean yeah like we shouldn't do it this time
[15:51.64]Why would you stand in front of it?
[15:53.18]I'm dying.
[15:53.56]You just stand in front of it.
[15:55.25]Hold on, I'm dying.
[15:56.83]Not even a second thought.
[15:58.19]If I were.
[16:03.17]This game requires so much concentration.
[16:05.89]There is no, like, funny commentary.
[16:07.99]No, there is.
[16:08.89]What's a funny commentary?
[16:11.20]Yeah, the funny commentary is... I think I just made so much noise that I just shook the walls.
[16:19.76]Oh, here it comes.
[16:20.85]Here it comes.
[16:21.37]Oh, fuck me!
[16:25.95]Oh, fuck me!
[16:28.03]Ooh!
[16:28.43]No, no, no!
[16:35.10]What are you doing?
[16:45.56]Because it hit the wall, it goes up and down when it hits the wall.
[16:48.28]This is the scariest game ever.
[16:49.30]It really is.
[16:49.72]It was like that before, too.
[16:56.38]Oh, no.
[16:58.26]Oh, fuck.
[17:01.97]Ow.
[17:02.11]Were you trying to hit me?
[17:09.27]No, I was trying to hit it right when it came out.
[17:16.91]Alright, we gotta just stay over there.
[17:19.11]Ow.
[17:20.05]Ow.
[17:21.01]Alright, well I didn't want to get hit twice.
[17:22.75]Go all the way to the edge.
[17:24.65]Let's try to get the monster to break through.
[17:25.97]Oh no, that was only on the sewer.
[17:29.25]What?
[17:29.77]I don't know if the other stages have anything like that.
[17:35.57]I'm trying to speed it up.
[17:36.99]Oh my fucking god.
[17:38.25]Alright, just replay.
[17:39.19]Forget it.
[17:39.51]Let's give you a free kill.
[17:55.72]Oh, shit.
[17:56.96]Oh, shit.
[17:58.78]I can.
[17:59.62]I can teabag you.
[18:02.34]Very good game.
[18:04.08]So, let's explain the game.
[18:07.28]So, pretty much how it works.
[18:08.72]So, you got two sides, right?
[18:09.94]You've got red team versus blue team.
[18:12.29]And it's a red team's goal to hit the blue team's player with this spherical entity.
[18:18.25]It's a big circle.
[18:21.34]It's a large circle that is probably an easier word to say.
[18:25.72]It comes away from me right now.
[18:31.20]What goes back and forth, that pixel's on the screen, and you have to try to hit the other person's team with that protractor.
[18:40.51]When you take a protractor and you go around in a circle with the... I just said circles, never mind, the joke is over.
[18:46.55]I don't... that was a joke?
[18:51.77]No, I was trying to not say the fucking word ball.
[18:56.51]I don't even know what I was trying to say.
[18:57.81]You understand it's like being speech jammed trying to play this.
[19:01.57]I was going for something and it just wasn't going to work out.
[19:18.74]I summoned the monster.
[19:19.60]I didn't see it.
[19:22.13]How did you not see that?
[19:22.85]Because I was focusing on dying.
[19:24.13]You didn't see the monster?
[19:32.17]Really?
[19:32.39]I was gonna... I grabbed that shit.
[19:34.49]You wish you grabbed it.
[19:42.07]Take this!
[19:44.14]Sure.
[19:45.72]Holy fucking hell!
[19:46.60]That was insane.
[19:53.18]He didn't come out that time.
[19:54.70]He's peeking up a little bit.
[19:58.97]That was a good play.
[20:00.73]Oh, that was a bad play And that ability is a rough one Oops the Jermamites ha ha Then that guy for life by the way, I don't want to die I
[20:29.84]Alright, so if, hey, how about instead of like jokey, like stick the knife in and twist it jokes.
[20:37.56]Yeah.
[20:37.80]What do you actually want to do here?
[20:38.92]I don't know.
[20:44.57]I think everything in your life has lost value to you.
[20:48.01]There's nothing I could offer you that you don't already have.
[20:52.60]You're such a big Jerma now.
[20:56.10]high in the clouds with his head and his ego.
[20:58.56]What can I possibly offer?
[20:59.88]How's that?
[21:06.38]You know, I got a new place.
[21:08.46]You know what I could use right now?
[21:10.89]I could use some new curtains here.
[21:15.57]New place.
[21:15.91]Yeah, why don't you have your real friend, Detallax, get them?
[21:19.11]Hey, you got a new place too.
[21:21.03]Don't you need some new curtains?
[21:24.19]Perhaps.
[21:29.41]But is this the curtain battle?
[21:32.49]This round?
[21:36.61]Yes!
[21:39.99]Okay.
[21:40.75]Okay.
[21:41.47]See, the Candyman said yup like four times.
[21:44.03]I thought you heard it.
[21:45.56]Yup.
[21:47.10]Oh my god, you're cheating.
[21:53.34]Nice throw.
[22:04.38]See, the thing that's different this time is that we're both terrible at this game.
[22:18.48]I tried to grab that shit.
[22:22.66]Oh, you fucking lobbed it over at me.
[22:24.26]You fucking lobbed it over at me.
[22:36.38]Oh my god, why would I do that?
[22:37.34]I keep doing that.
[22:45.89]Not this bullshit.
[22:46.55]I remember this shit from last time we played.
[22:48.25]Then you get out of the way.
[22:49.45]I remember that.
[22:56.77]Come get it.
[22:57.89]Oy!
[23:01.03]That slowed down so much.
[23:04.27]Why?
[23:13.34]Oh my fucking lord.
[23:14.38]What am I thinking?
[23:15.70]What am I thinking?
[23:16.56]Oh my god!
[23:27.01]So is that one curtain?
[23:30.55]Two curtains a set?
[23:31.71]You get one side, okay?
[23:35.55]One side?
[23:36.05]What does that mean?
[23:36.89]You get one side.
[23:38.19]You get a double window.
[23:38.97]That's one curtain for one side.
[23:40.70]One of the double windows.
[23:41.42]Oh my god.
[23:43.22]You always wear a cheapskate.
[23:44.28]I want to summon the guy.
[23:55.46]So let's go to the, wait, this one here?
[23:58.34]Yeah.
[23:58.76]Is it this one?
[23:59.34]Yeah.
[24:01.04]No, not this one.
[24:02.84]Well, it's too late.
[24:03.72]So you get one side of one curtain.
[24:13.37]Oh my lord.
[24:13.95]Ay yai yai yai yai.
[24:20.49]Ayyy.
[24:29.24]Oh.
[24:31.58]Can I get- can I get up?
[24:32.76]Haha, you just got Mortal Combatted.
[24:34.98]I just swept your leg over and over again.
[24:36.58]I really stood up into it three times.
[24:39.53]I don't know how you control standing up in this.
[24:53.82]Catch it!
[24:55.92]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[25:02.77]Stop it.
[25:10.90]What's happening here?
[25:12.82]You're a bull hog.
[25:14.06]I was just waiting on the other side, like it'll come here eventually.
[25:27.53]Oh, what the fuck am I doing with it?
[25:29.56]Taunt, what's the taunt button?
[25:30.98]I don't know, but you better stop pressing it.
[25:36.14]It's too fast.
[25:38.24]I can't get it.
[25:38.90]Oh my God.
[26:03.87]Get him!
[26:08.75]Did he just aiya?
[26:15.32]That makes me so happy.
[26:19.30]He just said aiya?
[26:22.08]Yeah.
[26:25.33]Why does that make you happy?
[26:26.61]Because that's what all the old Chinese men say during ping pong.
[26:33.31]Is it?
[26:33.77]Yes.
[26:35.32]It's a Chinese thing.
[26:38.56]I played like a week after I moved here and it's been a while though.
[26:42.02]I haven't gone back.
[26:43.68]My chat knows that I showed up.
[26:45.72]I paid $500 for a year membership and never came back.
[26:53.32]Well, you sure sound like you know what the fuck you're talking about.
[26:57.66]Press mute here.
[26:58.36]Let's mute it.
[26:59.62]No, we fucking don't.
[27:05.29]Wait, there's a store?
[27:06.87]What?
[27:08.45]There's a store?
[27:09.89]In this?
[27:11.25]I think there's like skins.
[27:11.94]You can buy characters?
[27:12.90]I caught that one on the edge.
[27:18.92]Oh, I thought I timed that right.
[27:23.61]What a bunt boy.
[27:37.69]Damn it.
[27:44.13]Did I catch it?
[27:44.69]Yeah, I did.
[27:45.65]Oh god, I hate that.
[27:47.31]Oh my god, I got caught.
[27:48.09]I thought I got hit.
[27:50.45]I got hit.
[27:50.90]Oh, you did.
[27:54.52]You did get hit.
[27:59.68]No.
[28:01.34]Oh, I thought you did get hit by it.
[28:03.02]Sometimes your character does this thing where he crouches forward and it looks like he gets hit.
[28:06.92]Yeah.
[28:09.62]Yeah, sometimes it'd be like that.
[28:13.66]Okay, we have fun over there.
[28:19.68]What?
[28:20.16]How did that hit me?
[28:21.03]Oh.
[28:23.49]Oh.
[28:25.13]Yeah, you don't know nothing about curving the ball and spin.
[28:37.85]Oh, you don't know how to spin.
[28:38.99]That bounced back.
[28:40.14]That bounced around.
[28:47.40]What?
[28:47.64]I thought... I thought I turned.
[28:50.52]I turned.
[28:51.04]I turned around.
[28:55.83]Slice and dice.
[29:07.68]I turned her out.
[29:09.22]That was bullshit.
[29:12.12]What the hell was that?
[29:15.52]I wish the other boys unlocked.
[29:17.70]They have like the giant boombox boss you can play as.
[29:22.52]Yeah, you get like currency though, don't you?
[29:24.14]There's some kind of currency thing?
[29:25.80]Dude, I don't know.
[29:28.36]I'm gonna try somebody else.
[29:29.47]I'm gonna try Skateboard Man.
[29:32.57]I remember playing him a lot.
[29:36.33]Like, we can unlock different modes in the store, apparently.
[29:39.43]Oh yeah, remember there was a big ball mode?
[29:44.62]Ah, was there?
[29:45.10]Yeah, there was a giant ball mode.
[29:46.86]And my Streamlabs has been turned off this whole time.
[29:49.74]It's like I don't even know how to fucking stream.
[29:52.62]Your what was turned off?
[29:53.64]Sorry, but my Streamlabs.
[29:55.73]Oh.
[29:56.57]What is this special movie?
[29:57.57]Skateboards Around?
[29:59.07]I don't remember.
[30:08.50]One of these days I'll get it.
[30:11.00]Oops.
[30:14.38]Brain.
[30:15.00]Kick flip.
[30:16.35]Kick flip.
[30:25.55]Damn that.
[30:30.95]Oh my God.
[30:33.29]When you all just like jump around like idiots.
[30:44.55]Wait, what is that?
[30:46.07]Hold on a second.
[30:49.13]That's a different move.
[30:50.13]One of them's his throw, probably?
[30:52.35]No, okay, that's just a different move for Bunt.
[30:54.59]For a second, I was like, what the hell is LF Trigger?
[30:57.81]Does anything else do anything?
[30:58.78]Are we missing something?
[30:59.80]I'm trying to figure out how to play the fucking game, and he just throws a ball at me.
[31:02.84]Bunt hit throw on your special, that's it.
[31:10.06]What?
[31:10.24]That hit me?
[31:11.50]Yeah, nice internet, man.
[31:16.82]My internet?
[31:19.18]Yeah, I know.
[31:19.70]It's not good.
[31:20.90]Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:22.40]That's not true.
[31:22.92]The internet is fine here.
[31:24.10]It's a great internet.
[31:24.86]It's great speeds.
[31:26.28]Fast speeds.
[31:27.02]It's just the company that makes it.
[31:29.18]Well, they don't make the internet.
[31:30.10]Nobody makes the internet.
[31:31.04]It's just data that travels through tubes.
[31:33.90]But the company that's responsible for moving the traffic, the internet traffic...
[31:37.78]is having a little bit of a problem right now, as you can plainly see.
[31:41.54]It's not good.
[31:42.16]We've been informed that it is going to get fixed.
[31:45.40]And maybe soon enough here, you'll see it.
[31:47.38]And I just fucking won the goddamn game.
[31:49.51]I did great.
[31:52.09]I think I swung in the opposite direction on every ball.
[31:56.37]Because I won the last two in a row, do I delete your curtains that I gave you?
[31:59.31]We never agreed to another deal.
[32:01.31]No, you never agreed.
[32:02.31]Because if we're going to agree, then I'm going to go to my main.
[32:09.89]Alright, let's do one more and see if we can get another game mode.
[32:15.09]Okay.
[32:15.61]How much is another character?
[32:16.55]I think you might have to go through the story mode to unlock characters.
[32:22.40]Oh, really?
[32:22.96]I don't know.
[32:25.96]This one.
[32:29.28]No, I went ready up.
[32:31.50]X. I tried to click the ready button.
[32:34.46]It's X. It's not X.
[32:39.10]Okay, well, never mind.
[32:40.02]You're X. It's 1,000?
[32:44.48]You buy characters with the Sparks you earn while playing the game.
[32:49.68]It's 1,000 bucks.
[32:51.88]So, we're almost there.
[32:52.82]We've been playing for like 30 minutes.
[32:54.14]1,000 bucks DLC.
[32:58.86]Oh, you don't know nothing about this spin.
[33:07.62]Ooy.
[33:08.36]Ooy.
[33:09.67]Ooy.
[33:10.19]Oh, look at those omnics in the background.
[33:13.67]Oh, speaking of Overwatch, so what do you think about the new character?
[33:17.49]I think it's just McCree without his flashbang, which is how he should have been originally.
[33:27.06]Oh.
[33:27.32]Not this time.
[33:28.58]You're not going to go backwards on me this time.
[33:31.22]Ooy.
[33:32.14]Ooy.
[33:32.92]I don't know if I like this character.
[33:34.11]It's the character.
[33:34.71]It's the fucking character.
[33:42.46]Oh, that's the character.
[33:43.34]No, the character.
[33:44.22]The mallet's too heavy.
[33:45.55]The mallet's just really heavy.
[33:46.77]It is really.
[33:47.35]It's just heavy.
[33:48.07]It's slow.
[33:49.97]And, uh... Oh, please.
[33:56.99]That's just... The mallet's a little too big for me.
[34:02.52]No, I mean... People are going to take that.
[34:05.34]I'm going to...
[34:10.24]Maybe we're going to take that.
[34:11.72]That's not what I meant.
[34:12.62]Are people going to take that?
[34:15.98]So how often do you itch your nose?
[34:19.69]How often do I itch my nose?
[34:20.67]Yeah.
[34:20.77]I don't know.
[34:22.59]Maybe once every... Or wipe your nose.
[34:26.67]Whoops, I quit.
[34:27.91]Host has quit the game.
[34:29.17]Alright, well, fine.
[34:29.71]That's fine.
[34:30.06]Alright, so let's go to...
[34:32.63]What is showcase?
[34:34.15]Characters.
[34:35.31]Oh.
[34:35.69]We're like 20 coins away from being able to get one.
[34:40.07]How come I don't have 985?
[34:40.97]That would have been perfect.
[34:44.91]Okay.
[34:45.47]And the modes cost like 400.
[34:46.64]Okay.
[34:49.38]Free-for-all team is Lethal Volley.
[34:54.37]Oh, okay.
[34:54.93]This is cool.
[34:55.29]This is, uh, it's like tennis or like ping pong.
[34:58.13]Oh, dude, ping, lethal volleys, ping pong.
[35:00.54]You know that, you know that.
[35:01.94]I'll buy that.
[35:03.20]And then, cause I'm going to, I'm going to.
[35:04.42]Do I have to own it too?
[35:05.40]I don't think you have to own it.
[35:06.72]Dude, you have to pay to earn how to play too.
[35:11.76]That's why.
[35:12.18]Secrets that give the game the competitive edge.
[35:17.19]Or like volleyball.
[35:18.89]Okay.
[35:19.23]I'm in the game.
[35:19.87]Join on me and we'll play volleyball.
[35:24.41]Yeah, but volleyball is just tennis.
[35:27.96]They dragged the poles up a little bit higher.
[35:32.02]Guys, tennis has been around for like 2,000 years.
[35:35.10]Yeah, I believe it was Plato.
[35:38.14]Tennis was invented in the... No, it wasn't.
[35:41.09]It was the fucking Ming Dynasty.
[35:42.27]They fucking played tennis.
[35:43.65]Yeah, and when Plato traveled there, he came up with it.
[35:56.87]There's new evidence to suggest that Jesus was Japanese as well, and he had a son, and his name was something.
[36:05.74]What are you doing right now?
[36:07.12]I don't know.
[36:07.58]I don't know what this is.
[36:09.36]Did I just lose?
[36:11.98]Yes.
[36:12.66]I guess you have to hit it over.
[36:14.44]You can only hit it three times, and it has to come over.
[36:16.85]Okay.
[36:17.77]Alright.
[36:18.07]So don't jump around.
[36:23.35]If the ball slows down, it's not the speed.
[36:26.63]You're losing the speed aspect of the game.
[36:31.72]Nothing's going forward.
[36:33.48]I'm pressing up.
[36:34.28]I would laugh if it just landed right there.
[36:41.14]You suck ass.
[36:43.77]This is the first time I've ever seen it.
[36:47.89]Just buried into my own core.
[36:48.93]It's so hard not to just hit it straight down.
[36:58.88]Alright, we're getting the hang of this.
[37:00.92]But how does that make any sense?
[37:03.00]Wouldn't it have just been a point for me?
[37:04.50]Oh my god.
[37:06.64]What happened?
[37:07.36]You can only hit it three times.
[37:13.70]Good strategy, I'm thinking I'm picking up on this.
[37:19.99]Stop.
[37:21.07]I just gave you a perfect ball to spike.
[37:24.67]Oh fuck!
[37:33.80]Yeah, like when you jump and press up, you just slam it down to the ground.
[37:37.75]Yeah, you just can't... Oh my god.
[37:40.91]You have to be completely under the ball.
[37:43.53]Or to even be remotely possible.
[37:52.28]Oh no!
[37:57.54]Can I grab the ball and throw it at you?
[37:59.52]Does that still work?
[38:00.86]Got it.
[38:02.68]I think you can still grab here.
[38:07.25]Ooh, I just saved that one.
[38:08.65]That's what I call a fucking save.
[38:13.29]Ooh!
[38:14.23]How do I dive?
[38:16.31]How do I dive?
[38:18.21]What?
[38:20.27]No!
[38:22.01]Why did I jump over it?
[38:23.21]What the fuck?
[38:23.91]I actually really like this game mode.
[38:25.43]It's very awkward, but...
[38:30.17]I just called you dad.
[38:39.54]I swear to God.
[38:53.79]I'm just playing simple D. Just hit it back, you know?
[39:00.42]It's because I'm, like, my fucking analog, like, spins me around in circles.
[39:06.52]I'll tilt, like, one direction, and then I rip the other direction.
[39:09.62]Yeah.
[39:09.82]Ripping this thing out.
[39:12.48]Controllers be like that.
[39:13.62]I'm fucking tearing this thing out.
[39:16.96]I'm gonna plug in my Steam controller.
[39:20.42]Do you actually use that?
[39:22.96]No, God, no.
[39:24.30]Oh, my God, no.
[39:35.32]Mad cuz bad, blaming the controller.
[39:38.84]Yeah, I can blame the controller.
[39:40.90]Because I know that in my brain, I've got these inputs and this knowledge and this data that's just like flying around everywhere.
[39:48.47]And it's so intense.
[39:50.11]And then like it has to translate through my hands into a controller.
[39:54.93]Didn't we talk about this before?
[39:56.70]About how you're too fast of a thinker.
[39:58.60]You're too smart.
[40:00.52]Yeah, like it has to transfer through, like it has to go through like the pipeline to my hands and shit.
[40:04.74]Like, God damn it.
[40:05.78]It just hooked me into the fucking machine.
[40:07.12]You know what I'm saying?
[40:12.32]Ooh, nice, nice get.
[40:22.51]See, the pipeline of my brain just wasn't ready.
[40:26.72]See, that's what I'm talking about.
[40:28.00]And then my brain pipeline is just.
[40:33.68]Like, if you could just connect a wire to the back of your head and just, like, stare at the screen and, like, hit out, go, go, go!
[40:37.61]Like, you have to transfer data through your hands to the controller.
[40:40.69]No!
[40:41.29]There's too many middlemen there.
[40:44.37]What hap- It's three hits.
[40:46.39]Stop asking what happens!
[40:50.34]I will divorce!
[40:54.04]Oh boy, you're really unraveling here.
[40:58.62]But remember, everyone's gonna keep his- Oh, Gerber sucks!
[41:00.72]Gerber sucks!
[41:01.41]Oh, that's just- Gerber, Gerber sucks!
[41:05.90]Good one.
[41:09.28]Whatever.
[41:15.32]Oh my God, that is so annoying.
[41:28.29]I just tried to like, I tried to like meet the parents here right there.
[41:31.65]I was gonna just like full on spike it down into your head.
[41:37.21]Oh, that would have... I wish you would have just fucked it up right there.
[41:40.07]I'm doing great.
[41:43.86]See, I'm trying to... I'm overcomplicating it.
[41:55.68]It always... Go up!
[41:59.62]Be able to hit it up from the air, you goon!
[42:05.99]Oh my god.
[42:07.65]I'm going to win this.
[42:09.21]This is the comeback.
[42:10.91]No, it's not.
[42:11.37]This is the comeback.
[42:13.15]I literally 100% guarantee you don't.
[42:15.55]If not, I will delete my Twitch channel.
[42:24.16]Oh my god.
[42:24.80]That's like the deal of winking at you saying the next hand is blackjack for you, sir.
[42:29.42]I'm going to go all in.
[42:31.20]Rematch me.
[42:31.74]Rematch me.
[42:32.24]Next game's blackjack.
[42:33.18]Next hand.
[42:34.34]See, I wasn't in the right skin.
[42:38.29]This is the skin that I need to win.
[42:44.53]You made that bet a million times.
[42:46.08]Yeah, I know.
[42:50.92]So, which one?
[42:51.54]Let's go to this one.
[42:52.44]Construction Yard.
[42:57.26]Yeah.
[42:58.10]I'm not going to lose a single point this game.
[43:07.78]Yeah, go get it, noob.
[43:11.24]This is the skin.
[43:12.02]This is the good one.
[43:14.26]Boom.
[43:28.07]What the fuck happened with that one?
[43:29.23]See?
[43:29.65]You can't press a direction when you're in the air.
[43:31.67]Otherwise, it just goes straight to the ground.
[43:40.58]point because of you no it's cuz it's with neutral air neutral air that's the problem neutral air is the problem I see that's how I lost no no no that's not neutral air Jesus Christ Almighty
[44:14.57]Oh wait.
[44:35.87]It didn't go to the right like I thought it would.
[44:43.71]I'm trying to be fancy.
[44:44.55]You can hit it straight up.
[44:45.75]So if you press up, it'll go up.
[44:48.17]I'm too scared to do that.
[44:49.25]That's too much for me.
[44:55.48]I did it again.
[44:56.32]He did it again.
[45:09.42]See, when you wrote the scripts before we started this stream...
[45:12.90]yeah you didn't think this would be funny but this yeah remember when we wrote the script and we were like yeah let's not know how to not hit the ball into the ground for like 30 minutes and you were like nah that's not gonna be that funny what are you playing yes this script I swear to god I had it I had him right there in my grasp and I just let him go
[45:58.77]Okay, let's try that again.
[46:00.77]That's tight.
[46:06.57]This is too much for me.
[46:11.48]Don't unravel here, come on.
[46:16.32]Woo!
[46:18.54]As painful as this is and how stupid we look, I actually really like this game a lot.
[46:24.38]I came all the way back there too.
[46:27.26]It was the skin.
[46:29.12]People were like, on the subreddit, just like, in real time, going like, COME BACK!
[46:33.56]OF THE CENTURY!
[46:34.20]DUDE, HE'S COMING BACK RIGHT NOW!
[46:35.80]And I got like, a rush from it.
[46:38.18]On the Reddit.
[46:40.22]Yeah, like, you refresh like, new comments, like, zero minutes, zero minutes, zero minutes, you know what I mean?
[46:44.83]Fucking let them all down.
[46:49.01]And everyone got banned.
[46:51.63]Just vote random every time, because otherwise I think it makes us wait ten seconds.
[46:55.78]for each person to vote.
[46:57.12]I don't know.
[46:57.50]Does it?
[46:57.82]Alright, I'm going to get, let's, let's, let's try a new game mode after this one.
[47:03.11]Get the, get the Reddit post ready.
[47:08.55]If I, whatever.
[47:11.01]You just, just whatever.
[47:23.88]He's not going to do it.
[47:24.36]He's going to fuck up here.
[47:25.02]He's too far away.
[47:26.77]What in the name of God was that?
[47:28.03]What happened?
[47:28.53]You did your special move.
[47:30.99]Oh, of course he wants to play with items on.
[47:41.32]The dead ball just died.
[47:45.02]Deflate gate.
[47:45.76]Deflate gate.
[47:46.92]That was Daria from fucking the Daria intro.
[47:51.92]You gotta be fucking kidding me here.
[47:53.22]Ooh, what a recovery.
[47:54.41]The Reddit's gonna be talking about this one for a year.
[47:58.43]Oh no.
[48:06.04]Oh no.
[48:15.20]You're dead.
[48:21.49]You're dead, buddy.
[48:21.85]This game's fun.
[48:22.29]What a fun game.
[48:25.78]Oh my god.
[48:27.50]That one wasn't a mistake.
[48:28.68]Like, it wasn't the same dumb thing we've been doing.
[48:30.92]That was, I thought I had it.
[48:35.60]Oh my god, the Reddit.
[48:38.88]My life for Reddit.
[48:41.28]Good thing that didn't hit it.
[48:43.00]I swear to fucking god, dude.
[48:44.04]I'm never playing that ever again.
[48:45.59]I'm doing that ever again.
[48:56.80]I've come to know how you're gonna do that shit.
[48:58.20]You're gonna throw it over every time.
[48:59.30]That's how you do it.
[49:02.28]See?
[49:02.40]That's what he does.
[49:05.51]It's a good move.
[49:06.93]How about a taste of your own fucking grandpa's applesauce?
[49:32.61]No.
[49:34.70]I thought I would bunt it over.
[49:36.84]I don't think I pressed it right.
[49:41.80]That was a good recovery.
[49:54.01]Every time in the fucking corner.
[50:02.95]That was a conflict in the middle there.
[50:10.95]One more point.
[50:18.88]You would have just lost right there.
[50:21.46]Thank goodness gracious.
[50:23.08]It comes down to this.
[50:24.06]Burst 18.
[50:33.00]Too hot, hot!
[50:36.40]Too hot!
[50:40.44]Actually, really, again, I'm a broken record, but that's really fun.
[50:50.49]Alright, let's get a new character.
[50:52.09]Did you see how many points we had?
[50:56.47]No, I got 1,400.
[50:57.05]Alright, we got... Alright, we have Mega Man boss, Fat McCree, and then a Dr. Wily.
[51:07.99]I want to play Doombox because he's so big.
[51:10.51]And that's how I am.
[51:11.63]I just keep getting bigger and bigger.
[51:14.14]So I'm getting Doombox.
[51:15.72]Alright, I'm going to do the Mega Man boss.
[51:17.68]This is like Cut Man.
[51:20.26]Told you.
[51:22.72]Okay.
[51:23.70]Hosting a game again.
[51:25.80]Alright, so I got this dude.
[51:28.11]Okay, cool.
[51:28.93]I could not afford a game mode.
[51:32.29]Well, we're just gonna have to unlock it.
[51:38.91]Oh, we can unlock how to play, too, by the way.
[51:40.97]Yeah, but I know how to play, too.
[51:43.61]Ooh, I'll be red.
[51:44.56]Oh, only three costumes here?
[51:49.92]One, two, three, uh, four.
[51:52.16]I'm gonna be green guy.
[51:59.44]What mode is this?
[52:01.48]I couldn't afford another one, so just volleyball.
[52:03.86]Oh.
[52:08.77]Well, there it is.
[52:09.57]Started.
[52:10.11]Okay, that's a good start.
[52:13.23]Oh, I can't double jump, but I get a cloak.
[52:19.54]What?
[52:20.48]I'm too big.
[52:21.34]I'm too big.
[52:22.02]Yeah.
[52:32.15]Your hitbox is just weird.
[52:38.29]Like, don't even fucking... I swear on everything that I've ever done that that was like... I was desperately trying to make that not happen.
[52:48.02]Oh, God.
[52:50.92]I thought it would bounce far enough.
[52:52.80]I got these big arms for nothing.
[52:59.27]He's too big for this shit.
[53:01.61]I can't get it out of the corner.
[53:17.52]I didn't even see where that went.
[53:22.68]Whoa.
[53:23.44]I don't know what it does.
[53:24.20]Whoa.
[53:26.70]Oh, can I test mine?
[53:27.70]Oh, no, I can't.
[53:28.30]Yeah, you have to build up that many hits in a round.
[53:30.76]Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!
[53:35.44]It's gonna get over!
[53:39.06]Nope, nope, nope.
[53:51.33]No!
[53:54.47]Tommy Pickles, man.
[54:03.23]I don't like this character.
[54:04.75]Maybe at least not for volleyball, because it's... Oh, piece of shit.
[54:12.63]Did you break it?
[54:13.35]You stepped on it.
[54:13.98]I just hit it straight down.
[54:18.16]Ooh, I was trying to play a little bit fancy.
[54:19.96]My throw doesn't gain you meter.
[54:30.39]Holy fuck.
[54:34.50]I don't know what this does, but I'm gonna do it.
[54:35.76]No, I'm not.
[54:36.28]I spent too much time focusing on the special and I shouldn't have won the game.
[54:42.01]No.
[54:42.59]Shit.
[54:44.57]It all comes down to this.
[54:50.99]No!
[54:51.57]God, this is so hard to not do!
[54:56.80]I want to hit it forward.
[54:57.98]No, straight down.
[55:01.98]He's gonna do it, Reddit.
[55:03.06]Okay, let's play a normal one so we can see what our supers do.
[55:07.14]That sounds like a good idea.
[55:08.78]So, do we rematch or do I just join you again?
[55:11.36]No, just play.
[55:12.92]I can change the game mode in here.
[55:14.80]Oh, okay.
[55:16.48]I can't press rematch.
[55:18.78]What?
[55:19.02]I'm in the character slot.
[55:21.36]No, I think I have to just rejoin you.
[55:22.72]Oh, no, I... I can't even quit the game.
[55:27.58]Wow.
[55:28.04]I believe I'm stuck here forever.
[55:29.23]It works for everyone else.
[55:30.73]What did you do?
[55:34.35]I don't know.
[55:35.37]There's a countdown on my screen?
[55:36.89]Alright, well, what's the countdown at?
[55:40.10]Oh.
[55:42.14]Count it down you for not selecting a character.
[55:44.28]Now we're starting a game.
[55:46.92]Are you sure about that?
[55:47.64]We're starting a video game right now.
[55:48.94]Yeah.
[55:52.38]Okay, now I can only quit.
[55:53.49]It took away my rematch.
[55:55.17]Hold on.
[56:03.50]Son of a goddamn... Oh yeah, Strikers, the other game mode, is supposed to be really cool.
[56:11.26]I fucking... I force quit OBS.
[56:21.35]No, that has nothing to do with cocks.
[56:25.57]Jesus, goddammit, man.
[56:27.05]Rage quit.
[56:35.82]Oh, that's so... I'm so... I'm so angry that I just alt-f4'd OBS.
[56:42.37]Like, I alt... I fucking force-quit OBS.
[56:46.37]I did, like, the task, man.
[56:47.73]I... I get it.
[56:52.61]It's not even on the same window.
[56:55.35]Can I just, like, lock a window to never be, like, removed?
[56:58.14]You know what I mean?
[56:58.66]Windows 11, make it happen.
[57:02.64]I can't wait for Windows 11.
[57:04.00]It's gonna be so much better.
[57:07.20]Don't worry, they're gonna skip two versions and it'll come up with like Windows 15.
[57:09.70]Alright, I'm back.
[57:15.16]I'm gonna join your game.
[57:18.72]Hey, what a noob.
[57:22.07]It's weird too for having power-ups on, like... There aren't that many of them.
[57:31.63]Oh yeah, and there's a minimum ball speed you can set.
[57:36.44]Alright, so you in the lobby?
[57:37.44]Yeah.
[57:38.02]Alright, coming in.
[57:39.72]Good thing we're gonna have two streams here now.
[57:45.74]God damn it.
[57:46.34]Like, such a bonehead, accidental, like, just killed OBS.
[57:49.56]Hey, hey, give yourself a break.
[57:50.85]You've never streamed before.
[57:51.81]You know, it's been a long time.
[57:56.33]Yeah, I raised the volume on the music.
[57:58.05]I saw people saying that they couldn't hear it, so I'm gonna put it up a little bit.
[58:06.72]I heard you say hit Alt F4.
[58:11.40]What is that?
[58:12.53]Is that your special?
[58:13.53]You turn into an electronic device?
[58:16.01]I don't know what this does.
[58:24.77]I think I like... I have no idea what that does.
[58:26.88]It goes into my hand.
[58:29.50]It looks like it comes back to me?
[58:30.62]Yeah.
[58:37.13]Well, let's see what yours does.
[58:39.13]Nothing.
[58:43.93]No, that must be, like, a proximity thing.
[58:45.36]It must, like, knock me around or something.
[58:46.74]Maybe you can change directions?
[59:01.93]The ball homes into you, apparently, when you do that.
[59:06.08]I don't, I don't, I guess, I don't know.
[59:09.32]Wow, that killed me.
[59:09.92]I guess.
[59:11.44]Yeah, it fucking murdered me.
[59:16.74]Do you have, like, extra speed on the ball or extra power on the ball?
[59:19.74]Are there, like, actual stats like that?
[59:21.26]I don't think so.
[59:23.99]Oh my lord.
[59:25.31]Oh my god.
[59:27.93]Oh my goodness, I didn't even hit the ball once.
[59:48.89]Whoa, whoa!
[59:50.69]Oh, he's got like a hook arm?
[59:52.71]I hook to it after I hit it.
[59:55.21]Strangely enough.
[60:07.84]Ay!
[60:09.22]What the fuck was that?
[60:14.76]I don't know.
[60:16.88]What'd I get?
[60:17.34]What'd I get?
[60:17.72]What's my Mario Kart?
[60:18.76]Oh, God.
[60:24.04]No!
[60:24.38]Stay away from me!
[60:25.11]No!
[60:28.39]I'm afraid to even go near it.
[60:30.75]Okay, I just skipped out.
[60:32.11]What happened there?
[60:33.37]I'm confused.
[60:34.13]It got bumped somehow, and then when it hits the ground, it resets to me.
[60:38.36]I guess you didn't hit it.
[60:45.99]Football's the worst power-up.
[60:48.95]Is it?
[60:54.38]He seems very hard to use.
[60:56.18]He seems like the worst character you could possibly have.
[60:58.96]He's big, and everyone's saying his special is homing, so that just means you know where the ball's gonna go, which is bad.
[61:10.67]Maybe.
[61:10.95]I'm back to volleyball.
[61:13.50]Doombox Special shoots the ball straight at the enemy.
[61:17.18]Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.
[61:20.12]You know where the ball's going to go, so it's bad.
[61:21.90]I think there's a few people that are telling you that you might be wrong about this statement, because apparently he's very good.
[61:33.15]Well, you know what I'm telling you is that... Who are you going to believe, Twitch chat or me?
[61:39.71]I mean, apparently the best player in Lethal League mains Doombox, so... I don't know.
[61:44.98]I mean, what does that say?
[61:45.58]That's because that guy is a Boombox, and he just plays him because he associates with the character.
[61:51.92]Oh, we're doing this thing again?
[61:52.86]Yeah, I like this.
[61:54.71]No, I couldn't reach it.
[62:04.73]Oh my god.
[62:05.39]Ooh, he was a little sloppy.
[62:07.07]He was a little sloppy.
[62:12.98]Oh, he's getting a little sloppy.
[62:14.86]It's because my ping pong paddle has horns on it.
[62:23.92]Whoa, nice spike.
[62:24.92]He's getting a little sloppy.
[62:34.69]I didn't hit it straight into the ground.
[62:45.17]That time I did.
[62:49.99]Did I just re?
[62:51.19]No, I didn't.
[62:56.99]I was trying to knock it back in.
[62:58.49]Throw into the wall where it just doesn't even bounce.
[63:08.40]Oh my god, he's gonna fuck it up again!
[63:09.94]It's in slow motion.
[63:17.46]Stop with the funky shit and just get it over there.
[63:19.18]Why did that go straight down?
[63:30.92]Straight down, straight down.
[63:34.44]Not even at an angle, straight fucking down.
[63:38.87]How is it even possible?
[63:54.83]oh shit oh there we go you accidentally pressed forward so you're gonna hit straight down not even why did I set you I was like he's not gonna expect this but why would anyone do this why would anyone do this okay
[64:28.24]Oh, fuck.
[64:30.93]Oh, fuck.
[64:31.51]Oh, fuck.
[64:32.29]Oh, fuck.
[64:34.43]Okay, I'm ready.
[64:37.47]My brain is prepped.
[64:47.79]Wowee, wowee, man, wowee.
[64:50.89]That was actually really great.
[64:52.69]That was a great volley.
[64:53.85]I mean, it just was.
[64:55.07]Nobody can say otherwise.
[64:56.01]They just can't.
[64:56.51]Ooh, that, not so much, though.
[64:59.49]That one, not so much.
[65:00.37]That was not so much.
[65:08.90]Oh, my God.
[65:14.98]What?
[65:15.28]Nice.
[65:19.94]600 experience points.
[65:21.36]I wish I could unbind forward.
[65:28.88]You might be able to.
[65:30.30]No.
[65:31.04]Because then I wouldn't be able to walk forward.
[65:33.23]What's the other game mode?
[65:34.71]Strikers, which is you have to defend against the thing.
[65:37.81]But if you buy it, you have to be the host.
[65:40.09]And I couldn't join your game last time.
[65:42.37]Should we learn to play again?
[65:43.69]There has to be something here that we don't know.
[65:46.56]I'm buying it.
[65:48.50]okay but I'm saying how to play you're gonna have to be able to host oh well then just play another couple because because I can't afford it alright let's see what's what's this uh learn to play two you do it too just watch my stream open up my stream watch my stream teaches you the ball parry alright so here we go you can bunt by holding you can you can aim bunts by holding left or right
[66:16.52]Nice elaborate scheme to get one plus one viewer.
[66:20.03]You can also aim bunts down advanced.
[66:21.77]Okay.
[66:23.25]Bunt down by pressing B and holding down.
[66:24.77]Okay, nice.
[66:25.67]Alright, you can bunt down.
[66:26.73]You didn't know that.
[66:28.03]I knew that.
[66:29.63]Hit the ball back and forth at high speed.
[66:31.78]Okay.
[66:33.52]Probably didn't know you could do that.
[66:35.56]You can see when the ball will release on the boom box.
[66:40.56]Oh, you probably didn't know that.
[66:49.70]Yeah, so you can see where the ball would release.
[66:51.46]I knew that.
[66:53.90]Did you?
[66:55.26]How come you didn't say anything about it?
[66:56.33]Because I thought you knew.
[66:59.13]You can parry if your opponent tries to hijack your ball.
[67:03.49]I'm doing this so you don't have to pay for it.
[67:06.32]To activate your parry, hit the ball and press B. You didn't know that.
[67:12.46]I told you that before you started the stream.
[67:15.44]You did not know hitting the ball and then pressing B. I haven't seen you do that move one time.
[67:19.96]Because you haven't tried to steal the ball from me once.
[67:22.95]This didn't happen.
[67:23.55]Look at this.
[67:23.91]This animation didn't happen.
[67:28.63]You didn't even know that.
[67:32.11]When you serve the ball, it automatically parries.
[67:36.20]Remember, it depletes your energy bar in case you were curious.
[67:41.18]So you can grab the ball.
[67:42.54]By the way, you're watching?
[67:43.94]Yeah, I'm watching.
[67:45.08]Okay.
[67:45.86]So if somebody's parrying, you can pull the ball out of their hand.
[67:50.27]I didn't know that.
[67:51.99]Well, look, something else you didn't know.
[67:54.35]Now you know.
[67:55.43]It's right stick to say all the emotes.
[67:57.09]You were looking for this.
[67:59.27]Bring it.
[68:01.28]See?
[68:05.48]Okay.
[68:06.00]That was $160. $160.
[68:08.72]I'm ready to play.
[68:09.69]So are you, so you don't have to play for it now.
[68:13.05]I totally don't have to play for it.
[68:17.05]Okay, join game.
[68:22.56]I kind of like the cut man.
[68:25.70]Cut man?
[68:26.26]His special is weird to me.
[68:27.88]I don't see how you would use his special in volleyball.
[68:31.63]Oh, you're really on this volleyball thing, aren't you?
[68:34.09]I'm on this volleyball thing.
[68:36.35]Oh, okay.
[68:37.84]You really like this game mode.
[68:42.10]Think of all the strategy.
[68:44.44]Think of how hard you can hit the ball straight down.
[68:54.07]Are you ready?
[68:55.05]Oh, home court advantage.
[69:04.38]I thought you had a little bit of a different approach there.
[69:07.24]Oh, that was a good one.
[69:21.48]Yeah, reach over the net.
[69:22.76]Good job.
[69:26.70]Nice, nice.
[69:27.62]See, we're getting better at this.
[69:28.72]I'm going to be the best volleyball player in North America.
[69:33.58]Yeah, I wish.
[69:35.36]You know what?
[69:37.36]You talked, so I couldn't play.
[69:38.58]Oh, sorry.
[69:39.12]Sorry.
[69:39.46]I won't talk anymore.
[69:44.40]Talk, speak here.
[69:45.06]A controller didn't turn the other way.
[69:46.52]I was quiet.
[69:48.42]Just quiet.
[69:52.26]I was going to hit it straight down.
[69:53.24]See, I talked, and then you fucked it up.
[69:54.72]I fucking hit the wrong goddamn button.
[70:22.16]Damn, that was a move you did there.
[70:28.93]Oh, what?
[70:30.07]It sped up off the wall so weird.
[70:31.51]That was weird.
[70:34.05]That was strange.
[70:39.25]Back at your own net.
[70:45.27]That, you see, that was a nice move.
[70:47.23]You messed with my expectations there.
[70:53.19]I'm trying to emulate what you did.
[70:54.95]Great move.
[70:55.99]I'm going to try it.
[71:05.22]Don't you dare.
[71:06.60]What?
[71:06.74]I wasn't close enough for that?
[71:07.62]I wasn't close enough for that, apparently.
[71:08.74]You were not close enough for that, apparently.
[71:10.74]Don't use this character.
[71:12.36]I gave up.
[71:13.47]Not using him again.
[71:16.05]He's a good character.
[71:17.55]His body is too weird for me.
[71:21.92]This guy's body is just so strange.
[71:23.34]His tail is all the way over there.
[71:24.45]His face comes out.
[71:26.31]He's like this Donald Duck looking motherfucker like, no, I'm done with him.
[71:35.79]Wow.
[71:36.49]Really be like that.
[71:44.94]Wow.
[71:47.94]They made you even buy new songs.
[71:52.97]Well, he's a good character if it's not in that... He's just too... He's too long.
[71:57.70]I think... You parried me, didn't you?
[72:01.24]Yep.
[72:01.40]I thought you were being real cute.
[72:02.84]Well, the server always parries.
[72:04.40]You just read that.
[72:07.42]I mean, I didn't... That was about two minutes ago.
[72:09.78]Just reading it would be like right now.
[72:11.27]Got it.
[72:13.65]You ready for this play?
[72:23.83]I heard that like two seconds later.
[72:25.50]I heard myself screaming.
[72:26.98]I swear to fucking god.
[72:46.29]What is happening?
[72:49.37]I can't do it anymore.
[72:50.73]I lost my mojo in the game.
[72:57.99]I think it's this character.
[72:58.81]I don't think this character is very good for this.
[73:00.51]No, it's, it's this game mode.
[73:02.41]It's like too deliberate.
[73:04.87]Oh, you have to like, you have to think?
[73:28.40]And I hit the ball backwards to myself.
[73:31.19]You hit the top of the net.
[73:33.83]You know what?
[73:35.03]The ball went backwards.
[73:36.17]It went the other way there.
[73:37.31]Backwards.
[73:38.13]I'm not sure what fucking happened on that one.
[73:43.42]I want to play the regular game mode.
[73:46.62]Oh my god.
[73:47.42]Fine.
[73:47.88]This is like the star game mode.
[73:50.95]And you all know what I'm talking about.
[73:53.50]This is the star game mode.
[73:56.14]Where after the stream, he's going to put like 100 hours into this game mode.
[74:00.67]Yeah, I am.
[74:02.53]I left because I can afford the other game mode.
[74:12.09]Now I can't leave again.
[74:13.22]I don't want to alt-tab OBS and kill him.
[74:18.31]Alright, I'm going to do this real slowly here.
[74:20.91]Well, I'm hosting.
[74:22.77]Hold on, hold on.
[74:24.37]Okay, I think I'm safe.
[74:28.94]Oh, it's the goddamn star mode.
[74:31.64]Are there AIs in this?
[74:36.68]I think so.
[74:37.02]Alright, coming in.
[74:42.48]Do you have enough for the new game mode?
[74:43.98]Yeah, yeah, I'm hosting already.
[74:45.86]Ooh.
[74:51.33]I guess I was going to say that Strikers probably needs four people for it to be good.
[74:55.49]But I don't see where I can add AI.
[74:57.01]Because you used to be able to, I know that, because we did it.
[75:00.62]I guess we could just do quick join.
[75:04.26]Also, the beach ball is on.
[75:05.34]Star wants to play with AI instead.
[75:06.50]The beach ball?
[75:08.04]I don't know if you're supposed to beach ball with this, probably not.
[75:13.18]So what is this one?
[75:13.90]You're defending your hole.
[75:17.07]Oh, okay.
[75:18.05]So can you hit your own hole?
[75:21.74]I'm sure we'll find out.
[75:23.00]Yeah, um... Because if you can put it in your own, like, hole, that would be bad.
[75:25.77]Yeah, the beach ball sucks for this.
[75:29.07]Hold on, let me see.
[75:30.63]Can you put it in your own, like... I don't think you can.
[75:37.52]I mean, we're kind of testing how the game works.
[75:42.42]I get it.
[75:43.14]It's cool.
[75:45.28]Nope, you can't.
[75:45.94]Yeah, so we're good.
[75:53.35]Yeah, this is rough with only two people as well What oh Oh nice score
[76:23.09]What?
[76:23.33]Nice score, buddy.
[76:30.88]What the fuck happened there?
[76:31.66]Oh, no.
[76:41.16]First five.
[76:42.14]You kind of need, like, a goalie, huh?
[76:45.29]Yeah.
[76:47.01]Where's your new best friend, Etalyx?
[76:48.63]I think he's downstairs.
[76:50.99]I don't think he has this game, though.
[76:55.01]that would be three oh well then I could get someone else I have friends I think I think I have friends that would be unfair how does this not hit your goal I pulled it away right before I hit it
[77:24.29]Okay, that just freaked me out.
[77:25.09]The music just stopped.
[77:25.81]Yeah, the music timed it perfectly for like... Don't you dare.
[77:32.72]Oh, come on.
[77:35.00]The world.
[77:35.72]Why don't you just block... Oh, that's what we call a super shot.
[77:48.55]That's what they call a super shot.
[77:57.90]I'm just like going don't you dare I'm just like posing in front of you wow that super is really good yeah it is good for this for sure oh my god I was trying to farm super to see if I could do some you're trying to do a super shot then come on man
[78:30.17]I fucked it up.
[78:31.39]It's alright.
[79:02.02]Nooo!
[79:03.13]My anus!
[79:07.19]What?
[79:16.10]Holy shit, holy shit!
[79:52.88]No.
[79:54.10]Ah, that was just too high for me.
[79:57.69]Damn.
[79:58.35]Again, too high.
[80:08.96]It feels like we got better.
[80:11.34]Kind of.
[80:19.11]no trying to be fancy alright baseball I can't believe those plays are legal I'll try yeah
[80:50.22]He'd probably be really good here.
[80:56.23]Yeah, just keep picking OP characters.
[81:01.65]See, I keep just changing characters, but you're playing the same character.
[81:04.77]He plays ping pong!
[81:07.17]You're getting to know every inch of that one character where I'm spreading my knowledge across multiple different people.
[81:14.97]Oops, that was...
[81:19.95]Wow, that was a pretty cool move.
[81:21.99]I'll give you that.
[81:27.51]Okay, I see what you're doing here.
[81:30.22]That's an interesting little play.
[81:31.28]It ain't gonna work again though.
[81:32.36]I mean, you know... Offense, defense.
[81:50.04]Oh my god, that is some bullshit.
[81:52.65]I guess at that point I just need to defend.
[82:00.71]What?
[82:02.05]Why is it still going?
[82:03.63]It went over it.
[82:05.51]Oh my god.
[82:08.21]Oh my god!
[82:09.70]I can't get it.
[82:16.36]Yeah!
[82:24.74]Oh my god.
[82:25.36]I can't touch it!
[82:28.05]Okay, I touched it.
[82:28.61]Okay, I touched it.
[82:33.65]My, my, my, my music gets me.
[82:36.07]So hard, makes me shake.
[82:42.80]Holy shit.
[82:43.74]Got him.
[82:56.78]I tried to grab it too, but it said no.
[82:59.02]You're lucky.
[83:05.17]I was like, holy shit, what happened there?
[83:39.03]Oh, my.
[83:39.43]There's the monster.
[83:40.51]Goodness gracious.
[83:47.93]No.
[83:49.65]Oh, we got, I got a chip.
[84:02.60]Oh, fuck.
[84:02.98]That was too high.
[84:03.54]Oh.
[84:08.24]Burst.
[84:16.72]Nice save.
[84:17.66]Intensity.
[84:18.72]No, no, no, no.
[84:49.85]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[84:52.67]Nice play.
[84:57.15]Oh my god.
[84:57.93]I forgot about throws.
[85:02.00]You can do them.
[85:04.40]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[85:15.57]Good video game.
[85:17.11]This is like... I love this game.
[85:19.94]They're so hyper-focused, they can't communicate.
[85:24.36]That's the excuse I keep giving about me and my wife.
[85:28.86]Wait, what?
[85:29.84]Every time we do couples therapy, we're just too hyper-focused.
[85:36.42]What the fuck?
[85:39.72]I'm ready.
[85:40.16]Actually, why would you want a boombox on this?
[85:44.25]I'm gonna hit it to you.
[85:45.55]He is bigger.
[85:47.37]He is a lot bigger.
[85:48.47]No, you stay with the green.
[85:59.07]Oh, there was a raid came in?
[86:01.43]Who raided me?
[86:02.55]I did.
[86:04.71]Oh, Critical did.
[86:09.88]Hold on, wait.
[86:10.64]Wait, wait, wait.
[86:11.38]Just pause the game.
[86:14.84]Thanks a lot, dude.
[86:15.42]Are you still here?
[86:18.90]Critical?
[86:19.73]Streaming?
[86:20.93]How's it going?
[86:22.89]I did.
[86:23.33]I did.
[86:23.73]I did.
[86:25.27]Well, thanks a lot, man.
[86:31.05]We'll have to hit you up after this.
[86:33.25]See how things are going.
[86:34.27]Wow.
[86:37.81]What?
[86:37.95]I'm not allowed to have other friends?
[86:39.25]No, but like when you're on a date with someone, you really shouldn't be looking at other girls.
[86:44.82]Hey, fuck you.
[87:03.50]Oh boy.
[87:07.12]Oh, you just went straight to it.
[87:08.14]Right straight ahead.
[87:08.74]I was like, this one's coming down because that's all we can do is hit it straight down.
[87:17.27]What?
[87:18.31]I'm just playing fundamentals right now, man.
[87:19.85]I'm just fucking playing fundamentals.
[87:31.26]Ah.
[87:31.68]Yeah, fundamental that.
[87:32.72]Jet set radio up my ass.
[87:33.98]I'm just gonna play fundamentals.
[87:37.69]It's all about the fundamentals, dude.
[87:39.17]You gotta get back to the basics.
[87:46.71]See?
[87:47.01]And I didn't play fundamentals that time, and you did.
[87:49.47]Oh my god.
[88:01.41]Oh, you know, you know, they say this is such a Jerma game mode Oh fuck it's gonna do the thing
[88:35.85]A little early.
[88:38.17]Oh, what a Jerma game mode.
[88:41.85]What a fucking sweaty tryhard over there in this Jerma game mode.
[88:45.66]Hey, let's keep playing this game.
[88:47.06]Yeah, okay, let's keep playing this one.
[89:02.57]We can do the other one.
[89:08.33]No, because you might have to fake the other one.
[89:10.51]I'm getting this comeback.
[89:34.64]Just go back to basics.
[89:36.00]Come back!
[89:37.77]I don't like her specialness.
[89:44.57]Oh, fundamentals.
[89:45.27]It's all about those fundamentals.
[89:46.35]I need this rematch.
[89:47.11]Are we doing it again?
[89:48.89]I need this rematch on my main.
[89:51.91]Okay.
[89:53.33]With my main skin and not in your home character's stage.
[89:58.79]Why not?
[89:59.66]That doesn't mean anything.
[90:01.42]It does.
[90:02.76]Well, then it's all random.
[90:04.02]I didn't pick it.
[90:04.64]No, you get plus 10 speed on your main stage.
[90:08.00]See, you'd like that to be true, wouldn't you?
[90:18.66]You would like that to be true.
[90:21.74]All those years.
[90:23.26]All those years of Star beating me at everything.
[90:26.05]But this, not this time.
[91:01.10]You gotta let him get one.
[91:01.96]Otherwise he'll cry.
[91:08.74]Gotta let him get two.
[91:21.57]Whoa, look out.
[91:22.83]That's fine.
[91:29.11]Oh, that's okay.
[91:29.85]That's okay.
[91:30.51]It's okay.
[91:30.95]It's okay.
[91:31.46]It's okay.
[91:31.88]It's okay.
[91:32.52]It's okay.
[91:36.98]It's alright.
[91:37.34]It's alright.
[91:37.72]Alright.
[91:37.96]Now you made it a fucking game.
[91:39.86]Now you made it a game.
[91:48.07]I made it a game.
[91:52.45]I like my run animation.
[92:03.37]Piece of shit.
[92:05.15]Oh, now you made it a game.
[92:06.05]Alright, okay, fine.
[92:12.40]I gotta go straight carry to the goal.
[92:27.83]Oh, shit in my pants.
[92:31.00]That's where it goes.
[92:40.00]Oh my god.
[92:45.31]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[92:52.87]Oh, you suck.
[92:55.47]Do I though?
[93:03.39]And he let it go through his legs in the World Series.
[93:05.49]I planned the whole thing.
[93:10.43]The ball went through his legs in the World Series.
[93:26.50]No.
[93:29.56]Come on, come on, come on.
[93:31.06]Fundamentals.
[93:38.70]And they blow into the World Series.
[93:40.74]Fundamentals.
[93:44.84]That got cocky at the end there.
[93:50.05]Why beat you at your own game?
[93:51.95]You got to let him win one.
[93:53.03]I mean, he's won one in like four.
[93:54.85]I mean, come on.
[93:55.27]It was inevitable.
[93:55.89]You can't be perfect every time.
[94:02.69]You got to let him get 10, you know?
[94:04.76]Just to build up his overconfidence.
[94:07.40]That's how you hustle.
[94:08.48]Then you say, oh, the rematch.
[94:09.52]We'll double, double or nothing.
[94:10.56]Oh, please.
[94:16.87]Oh, please.
[94:21.32]Please.
[94:49.48]Oh, that was a freaky move.
[94:50.68]That was a freaky, that was a freaky, that was a freaky eater, I'll tell you that.
[94:54.98]You remember freaky eater?
[94:57.28]How could I, how could you forget?
[94:58.52]I don't even remember talking to you about freaky eater.
[95:01.65]Well, my wife's a freaky eater, you know.
[95:06.29]No!
[95:07.23]Oh my god, that doesn't hit.
[95:10.63]Ooh, good thing you can't score on your own fucking goal.
[95:12.41]Hmm.
[95:32.15]I'm just, like, such a huge fan of cheesy potatoes.
[95:36.83]Oh, you're cooking broccoli?
[95:37.99]Why are you cooking broccoli right now, Star?
[95:46.11]I tried to block it!
[95:48.09]Parry.
[95:55.91]Fucking mayonnaise all over your face.
[96:02.02]I'm turning into Pee Wee Herman.
[96:16.11]Holy shit, I thought it was going to hit.
[96:24.63]Sometimes you got to be aggressive.
[96:26.64]Sometimes.
[96:38.40]Ah, yeah.
[96:40.98]Oh, man.
[96:41.76]Oh, man.
[96:42.42]I learned that from Star.
[96:46.38]Sometimes you gotta be aggressive.
[96:51.74]Come back.
[96:54.88]Okay, you gotta let him get 10 sometimes.
[96:58.28]You let me get 10, I let you get 10.
[97:01.57]That's how it works.
[97:02.55]By the way, level 10.
[97:03.83]That's a good comment you made there.
[97:11.29]That's not how friendship works.
[97:18.10]Oh, these guys are wind trading for views.
[97:22.60]That's what we're doing.
[97:23.32]Wind trading.
[97:24.50]That's what everyone's saying over here.
[97:26.84]Wind trading.
[97:30.77]I sped it up.
[97:31.25]Oh, new characters.
[97:31.95]What do you mean you sped it up?
[97:33.49]I sped it up.
[97:34.81]I hope you're ready.
[97:36.79]What are you doing?
[97:37.23]What do you mean you sped it up?
[97:38.76]I don't know.
[97:39.06]Okay, excuse me here.
[97:39.84]This is not regulation.
[97:41.34]Even if I lose this, it's not regulation.
[97:44.68]You can't just lower the hoop because you're not good at shooting the basketball.
[97:54.17]Oh, you cheat!
[97:58.17]No, please!
[98:01.85]How did that not go in?
[98:02.69]No!
[98:09.93]I'm gonna start doing the Vincent Price laugh here in a minute, man.
[98:34.42]Oh!
[98:36.64]Oops.
[98:41.57]Now, okay, now, okay, I gotta be careful here because how this happens sometimes is Star gets to the point where he needs to try his hardest.
[98:48.72]He's trying to get this to happen.
[98:50.48]He's gonna be totally silent, he's gonna focus, he's gonna stop saying anything funny.
[98:53.76]I haven't seen anything funny in years.
[99:07.41]Teaser feels bad, man.
[99:14.08]You want to parry me?
[99:14.90]I can go for a parry.
[99:32.21]It's so fast!
[99:34.17]It's like a bomb!
[99:38.97]I don't know what to do!
[99:42.21]Shit!
[99:57.80]I thought you were too high.
[100:00.00]I was a little bit, maybe not though.
[100:02.30]Alright.
[100:03.08]Alright.
[100:16.69]Holy shit, that moved around.
[100:30.71]Ooh, you did a thing with that.
[100:32.13]You made it, oh, okay, alright, I see.
[100:33.63]I did a thing with that.
[100:47.32]Oh, fucking Jesus.
[100:48.58]God, that's so good.
[100:53.15]It starts off so fast.
[100:57.75]No, I have to double jump for that.
[101:07.91]This is a very fun game.
[101:11.36]This is a very fun game.
[101:14.00]Okay, I set it back to regulation.
[101:16.16]New characters.
[101:17.36]New characters.
[101:18.38]I don't know if I have enough because I had to buy this game mode for you.
[101:22.74]Oh, it's Shocker from Spider-Man.
[101:26.56]Yeah, I can't afford any more.
[101:27.64]Okay, this guy looks kind of cool.
[101:29.78]I mean, I think it's just because I've been winning so much that it's just giving me extra points.
[101:34.06]Yeah.
[101:43.69]Yeah.
[101:45.18]Yeah.
[101:46.54]Am I coming in?
[101:47.60]Yep.
[101:48.66]What game mode?
[101:49.42]Am I?
[101:52.22]The good game mode?
[101:57.69]I mean, if you want to take this back and start to embarrass me again, you could do the volleyball game mode again.
[102:04.25]Yeah.
[102:04.95]Build up a little bit more confidence, maybe take us into the next round, you know what I'm saying?
[102:10.07]Who the hell?
[102:10.57]What?
[102:10.91]Jack the Ripper?
[102:13.66]Oh, it's Shocker from Spider-Man with plugs on his hands.
[102:16.56]Hmm.
[102:18.32]His name is Grid because he has a grid.
[102:23.78]Oh, I didn't check the costumes.
[102:24.90]Oh, that was a mistake.
[102:26.90]Let's see.
[102:31.68]Oh, I forgot what we were doing.
[102:33.06]Yep.
[102:33.46]Okay, this is the volleyball one.
[103:05.83]Whoa!
[103:06.31]Ooh, that's weird.
[103:12.38]I just, I just can't do this one.
[103:14.66]I can't do it.
[103:22.05]Oh yeah.
[103:24.39]That was fancy.
[103:36.42]I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried.
[103:45.04]That's what I wanted to do.
[103:45.82]No.
[104:14.28]no perfect yeah I can't get flawless no I think there's one too many yeah it's one too many some things never change I think this guy's kind of cool looking though there's a character design shut up Jeremy shut up
[104:37.96]Stop talking.
[104:38.54]He's the worst character design by far.
[104:41.51]What?
[104:41.85]What's wrong with his character design?
[104:43.59]You hate him.
[104:44.11]Why?
[104:44.45]What's wrong with his character design?
[104:51.19]He's cool looking.
[104:51.95]He looks like shit.
[104:54.40]He looks like corn, somebody said.
[104:56.42]He does.
[104:59.04]So, he's cool.
[105:01.86]That wasn't too many hits.
[105:02.64]Give me a break.
[105:12.84]corn he's a corn superhero what you have that's it that's so corn oh you missed it and I missed it too hell dude na na corn na corn
[105:49.50]I press up.
[105:50.16]I press up!
[105:52.82]And a corn.
[105:57.22]Oh, you got me with that little back and forth there.
[105:59.36]You got me with it.
[106:00.08]You got me with it, and it was... You got me with it.
[106:04.01]See you in the cornfield.
[106:08.67]You found a new outfit to unlock for Raptor.
[106:11.07]Alright, let's see the outfits.
[106:15.96]Okay, so I can be corn.
[106:20.80]Error texture on wall.
[106:23.70]Funky.
[106:24.08]I think I'm going to be texture wall error.
[106:27.37]You kind of have to be corn.
[106:29.67]No.
[106:33.45]This one kind of hurts.
[106:36.83]Let's try this one.
[106:37.55]I've been playing too much Soul Calibur that they just look like bad characters.
[106:40.88]People create a random grid thrown on them.
[106:45.60]Well, it's not.
[106:46.24]I feel like this stage has a higher ceiling.
[106:52.36]And I tried to go... I just cracked my neck so hard.
[106:55.33]I almost just broke my neck.
[106:56.19]Yeah, this whole stage is just bigger.
[107:03.01]Damn it.
[107:03.85]Damn it, man.
[107:04.63]I just got no patience.
[107:05.60]I got no patience!
[107:16.94]I got no patience, man.
[107:19.28]It's either 100,000 miles per hour.
[107:21.30]100 miles per hour or a bust.
[107:24.24]Oh, no patience.
[107:24.96]I had no patience on that one.
[107:25.99]See, if I just waited, I could have got it.
[107:31.25]I went the wrong fucking way.
[107:32.27]I have no patience.
[107:42.15]Just let him play himself.
[107:44.12]Don't even move.
[107:57.46]What are you doing?
[107:58.86]I tried to press X!
[108:00.80]It was too hard to press a different button.
[108:03.42]Just my fucking fat fingers went all over it.
[108:10.14]Oh, by the way, if you don't know how the game mode works, and the game works, so there's two sides, right?
[108:14.73]You got red versus blue, and there's a ball that goes back and forth between the two entities.
[108:22.88]Yeah, that was a good one.
[108:24.77]And I fucking just can't do this like game mode.
[108:28.26]I can't do it.
[108:37.07]Alright, like, let me explain.
[108:39.61]It's volleyball.
[108:42.17]No, no, but like the core video game itself, it's like, hey, here's a Porsche and you're on the Autobahn, but please go 10 miles per hour, sir.
[108:50.91]It's like, no, you're going to go fucking 100.
[109:04.37]So what you're saying is you spent all the money on a Porsche and you finally, you know, you have a Porsche and then you get there and it doesn't even have the internet.
[109:14.31]No, no, you buy a Porsche and it's like, oh, by the way, this thing can go zero to 100 in 0.2 seconds.
[109:19.37]And it's like, holy shit, wow.
[109:20.67]And then they put the Porsche between like one old lady in front of you and one old lady behind you.
[109:26.00]And so you can't go anywhere.
[109:26.88]You just have to go 15 miles per hour on your brand new Porsche on the Autobahn.
[109:30.16]What does that have to do with this game?
[109:31.46]I don't get the comparison.
[109:33.08]Because it's fast.
[109:33.96]It's a fast game with like back and forth crazy speeds.
[109:36.77]And then it's like, I got to drive behind an old lady.
[109:39.95]What's the old lady in this scenario?
[109:42.60]This game mode, volleyball.
[109:44.30]We're playing it again.
[109:45.14]And then we can play your stupid casual game mode.
[109:50.34]Oh, yeah.
[109:51.85]Oh, the casual mode.
[109:59.33]Game mode is an old thing.
[110:12.44]So, yeah, are you the old lady in this scenario?
[110:15.56]No, you are.
[110:16.28]Because you want to go so slow, and I want to go fast on the fucking highway.
[110:21.15]That ball went pretty fast.
[110:32.91]Right by you.
[110:36.95]I mean, why even play the other game mode if you can't play the slow one?
[110:40.27]I think it'd be too much for you.
[110:46.68]Turn around.
[110:48.20]Psycho driver.
[110:53.17]Psycho driver.
[110:59.29]It's all about speed.
[111:00.13]I just gotta keep moving around.
[111:09.92]Man, I saved you.
[111:15.87]I'm going too fast.
[111:17.05]I don't like how the stage is actually moving the camera.
[111:47.02]Why did I hit it again?
[111:49.00]Why did I?
[111:49.60]Why did I do that again?
[111:52.04]Why was I trying to do that again?
[111:54.42]I hit it, I hit it right there and it's dead.
[111:57.20]I did it.
[111:58.52]Okay, I'm fine.
[112:02.64]Wow, turn around.
[112:07.86]You jumping around, it's driving me crazy the way it's moving the camera.
[112:11.35]Like this stage is just like a pixel too big.
[112:21.69]That's fucked up because I have to jump, then turn around in the air to hit it.
[112:24.81]But if you press forward, then it goes into the ground.
[112:27.73]Well, I'm sorry.
[112:28.41]I have to move.
[112:29.11]You don't.
[112:32.07]Yes, I do.
[112:32.69]You don't have to move.
[112:35.16]Don't you understand?
[112:36.14]I'm playing better now because I'm moving around.
[112:37.88]Why am I just going like this?
[112:39.96]Yeah.
[112:52.84]That's really dumb.
[112:54.57]Nice game, fucking shitty developers.
[112:57.19]Got you.
[112:58.49]We're playing on a stage where one more volleyball, because I know you're sad that you're stuck behind this old lady, but we have to play one more.
[113:06.13]And you're going to vote for the white stage.
[113:13.62]Okay.
[113:16.34]So the screen doesn't... It still is.
[113:18.26]You lost one game.
[113:18.90]Come on, man.
[113:58.05]Wait, did I say oof?
[114:02.86]I did not say oof.
[114:03.42]Did I?
[114:03.64]Did I?
[114:39.19]Can I aim that down?
[114:39.79]I'm so afraid to hit it down.
[114:42.96]That was a great volley.
[114:48.50]Damn that.
[114:49.22]Shit, I bunted and you just slammed it.
[115:00.03]Bunt.
[115:05.49]I did it a little too far away.
[115:07.13]What was I doing?
[115:07.97]What was I thinking?
[115:13.71]That's because you have to turn around then you have to press forward I'm realizing where the suck is Ooh, I don't know what happened there, but I'll take it
[115:53.97]I tried.
[115:54.71]I tried.
[115:55.97]Don't lose it here.
[115:56.75]I lost it.
[115:57.64]I fucking just... Silent cry hearts.
[116:14.44]What the fuck was that?
[116:16.66]What the hell?
[116:17.72]That was just literally it.
[116:18.80]I'm in your head.
[116:20.12]I wasn't even ready for the ball.
[116:21.88]I wasn't even ready for the ball.
[116:23.83]Shake it off.
[116:24.27]Sometimes somebody hits a home run pitcher.
[116:25.79]Come on.
[116:46.17]That little curve.
[116:50.31]I tried to go up and it didn't do it.
[116:52.25]I can't even.
[116:53.13]Karamba!
[116:53.85]I can't even, Karamba.
[117:11.35]What?
[117:11.59]Did we both reach through?
[117:13.15]You reached through the net to my side.
[117:14.39]I blocked you.
[117:15.35]I blocked you.
[117:19.76]I died, I died.
[117:20.90]I fucking was... Spin around, you're good.
[117:45.02]Ooh, nice.
[117:46.90]Good volley.
[118:02.56]Ooh, right on the... I was too busy marveling over the bounce.
[118:09.17]I was marveling over the bounce on the net, and then you did the curve ball.
[118:13.31]Okay, what game mode do you want?
[118:17.69]Um... Regular?
[118:21.71]Regular game mode?
[118:26.03]I can't rematch again.
[118:27.38]I have to force quit.
[118:29.28]Wow.
[118:31.11]That's a shame.
[118:33.67]Alright, don't delete OBS.
[118:39.37]Okay, coming back.
[118:43.23]You have to rematch before he changes the game mode.
[118:47.22]Well, coming back.
[118:53.10]Team Reptile.
[118:54.10]Joining your game.
[119:08.67]I want to try this guy in regular mode.
[119:10.05]I feel like he has potential.
[119:18.94]Where are we going?
[119:19.94]Have we even played here?
[119:21.36]Played where?
[119:22.74]Here.
[119:23.02]I just unlocked two stages.
[119:24.56]Oh, okay.
[119:27.61]It's still on like super fast mode.
[119:37.91]Whoa.
[119:39.65]He teleports forward and then shoots it.
[119:59.32]I don't... It was because it was my serve at auto-parry.
[120:03.72]Ah.
[120:11.96]Ah, I was trying to queue up like a huge one.
[120:21.85]I'm afraid you keep feeder in between rounds on this one.
[120:36.60]What?
[120:36.92]It's less climactic when it starts fast.
[120:39.52]Yeah.
[120:40.90]It's a little too fast.
[120:43.52]See, this is the equivalent of being on the highway and you... We're doing tournament regulation.
[120:48.73]Regulation tournament.
[120:53.17]Damn, it stopped.
[120:57.41]Are you gonna main grid corn man?
[121:00.85]Where's the other stage?
[121:03.97]That you unlocked?
[121:05.59]The streets.
[121:06.59]The subway one?
[121:07.07]Yeah, this one.
[121:08.99]Oh god, that's a lot going on in the background.
[121:10.97]What the fuck?
[121:11.91]Ultra.
[121:35.19]Oh god!
[121:38.10]It bounced like three times behind me.
[121:40.76]Those bounces didn't make sense.
[121:41.82]Oh my god.
[121:57.63]I'm just gonna let it happen.
[121:58.53]You know what I'm saying?
[122:00.99]Like sometimes you just gotta let- Whoa!
[122:04.41]What?
[122:05.99]I promise you I hit that.
[122:14.28]That is so confusing.
[122:16.68]Yeah, that's really good.
[122:19.96]Oh shit, I thought it hit you.
[122:21.00]Did it?
[122:21.46]It did.
[122:21.74]Uh oh.
[122:24.72]Uh, stink ball.
[122:26.47]What?
[122:27.56]I don't know what happened.
[122:28.48]You're cheating.
[122:29.08]I didn't do anything.
[122:31.04]Hey, you're the one playing with items.
[122:33.72]Items are on by default.
[122:41.65]Ah, I was trying to... Invisible.
[122:46.35]What am I doing?
[122:52.41]Oh, is it invisible?
[122:53.25]I guess.
[122:54.99]That's weird.
[123:08.87]Oh my god, does he also say Cho?
[123:12.69]Tournament standard regulation match.
[123:17.49]Now, who put items on?
[123:20.23]Do I turn them off?
[123:21.78]How is that standard tournament mode?
[123:23.42]Because it's on by default.
[123:24.46]Oh.
[123:24.66]Uh-oh, you're going for... I'm going for big boy.
[123:36.03]Alright.
[123:41.69]You know what corn is weak to?
[123:44.05]Sound.
[123:48.91]That would be crazy.
[123:50.07]Oh, crazy if true.
[123:51.64]Ow.
[123:56.58]Ow, my head.
[124:14.86]Oh shit.
[124:16.08]Oh, where did it go?
[124:19.38]Damn.
[124:34.69]Damn it.
[124:35.75]Oh my god, it double tapped me.
[124:37.35]It went bang bang.
[124:38.19]Yeah, I'm standing up this hard sometimes.
[124:42.46]Oh, you keep your health between rounds.
[124:44.34]I didn't realize that.
[124:45.14]Shit.
[125:07.74]Trying to... What the hell is happening there?
[125:09.62]I know I have a hover, I just... Okay, I hold it that way.
[125:19.47]Shit!
[125:48.99]Alright, this is it.
[125:50.25]You have no health, man.
[125:51.09]I have one.
[125:51.67]Yeah, I know.
[125:52.05]I'm going to make it perfect.
[125:55.57]I knew you were going to do it.
[125:57.03]I knew you were going to do it.
[125:57.93]I just needed a little tiny tap.
[126:03.33]I knew it was going to happen, dude.
[126:04.45]I was trying to prepare for it, and preparing for it is what caused me a problem.
[126:08.17]Play this guy.
[126:08.55]Alright, ready.
[126:16.49]Drop.
[126:20.90]Didn't you dress up like that for Halloween?
[126:23.30]Like this?
[126:24.02]Yeah.
[126:27.12]With the claw and the hook?
[126:29.70]How would I dress up for a guy for Halloween?
[126:31.20]I don't even know who he is.
[126:33.40]You don't make any logical sense.
[126:34.96]I thought you made this game.
[126:36.26]It'd be so weird if I did.
[127:02.43]Oh, what happened?
[127:03.77]Did you seriously parry right there at the end?
[127:05.55]Yeah.
[127:07.07]Oh, you butthead.
[127:08.29]Oops, I... Wait, hold on.
[127:15.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[127:15.63]What?
[127:16.69]I don't think you can hit it when it's in the bubble.
[127:18.25]So when it's in the bubble, it can't be hit?
[127:20.34]I don't think so.
[127:20.74]Okay.
[127:21.86]That's interesting.
[127:23.38]That changes things a little bit.
[127:24.84]That makes her special better.
[127:36.93]Oh, man.
[127:37.65]Yeah, that's pretty good.
[127:38.93]That's tough.
[127:42.66]Oh, that went so fast.
[127:44.22]I just threw it at you.
[128:00.32]Ow.
[128:00.70]I'm just jumping into this one.
[128:15.43]noob just using throws the rose I can't parry it if it's in there okay I like her game yeah I know what I'm playing you don't have to tell me game
[128:45.61]I feel like Star is going to play as this character on ranked mode.
[128:51.26]I used to play in the real world with the rollerblades.
[128:56.40]Really?
[128:56.84]Yeah, back in the day.
[128:59.86]That's pretty cool.
[129:01.36]Did you actually rollerblade around?
[129:02.68]Did you not rollerblade?
[129:03.52]Yeah.
[129:05.22]I went to the skate parks and everything.
[129:07.30]Fruit Builder.
[129:13.93]I got an itchy eye and it's gonna fuck me up.
[129:15.55]Itchy eye syndrome, here it comes.
[129:27.14]Nice.
[129:32.83]Um, so now that this game's, uh, like, relevant again, right?
[129:37.05]Do you think something like this would show up at EVO?
[129:39.73]Um...
[129:41.14]Because that would be... How cool would that be?
[129:43.16]I would love to see this at EVO, but I don't think it will.
[129:49.06]I thought you were either going to... That would be so fun.
[129:53.98]Just put it in, like, the comedy slot, right?
[129:55.77]Isn't there always, like, a comedy slot for EVO?
[129:57.95]Is there?
[129:58.87]Isn't there, like, just a comedy slot?
[130:03.76]I mean there's a lot of side tournaments that are run that aren't on the main stage.
[130:07.68]So that they don't do like a for fun like just little fun like session it's all just all competitive?
[130:13.06]Uh no.
[130:15.86]Like what if they got like Burger King to sponsor it and you got like like free like meals for like a week or something?
[130:22.27]Free meals for a week?
[130:23.47]I don't know.
[130:26.49]Stand-up comedy at EVO.
[130:28.23]Yeah.
[130:29.22]Who's the best stand-up comedian?
[130:30.36]They already do that shit.
[130:31.42]They do, like, comedy battles.
[130:40.24]No, don't do it.
[130:42.24]Jesus.
[130:46.80]Fuck.
[130:48.56]Yeah.
[130:48.98]Wowie, wowie, wowie, wow.
[130:50.96]This is my last life I've been on, man.
[131:01.54]I don't know what to do.
[131:03.85]Oh my God, I jumped right into it.
[131:05.39]I don't know, I like her, but I also have a much harder time.
[131:11.93]I think it's the skin.
[131:15.46]Does Jerma think Eva was run by Comedy Central?
[131:18.94]Where's the comedy section?
[131:20.80]Look, I know.
[131:22.08]Hold on.
[131:22.88]Wait, let me explain myself here.
[131:25.60]I know that EVO is like all the major tournaments and all the big ones.
[131:29.87]And you got like Mortal Kombat, Injustice.
[131:33.71]That's the comedy section.
[131:35.91]Smash Brothers.
[131:37.98]You don't think I know this?
[131:40.88]Yeah, but like what are you talking about?
[131:44.47]Like, they don't have just like a show match type game or anything where people just play for fun?
[131:49.45]Or is it only, only, only?
[131:51.13]You said side tournaments.
[131:53.86]I'm saying not every game is streamed, but there's still tournaments.
[132:01.10]I'm just like, I'm just baiting right now.
[132:04.42]That's what I'm doing, guys.
[132:05.52]Anytime you say something stupid, you're just fucking baiting.
[132:07.38]It doesn't matter, you know what I'm saying?
[132:11.79]I'm just baiting you.
[132:13.03]Just baiting.
[132:14.23]Me too.
[132:14.89]Every night, just baiting.
[132:18.82]You really like di- You really- Okay, so it's been a while since you and I have like really played a game together.
[132:23.94]You've really like dialed up the sexual humor a little bit, haven't you?
[132:26.56]You're like a sec- Are you a sexual humor comedy channel now?
[132:29.14]I, uh... I go to Evo for the sexual humor comedy.
[132:34.65]I win every year.
[132:37.47]I don't have a star making like- Like being at like the sexual comedy show.
[132:54.88]Damn it.
[132:56.28]Nitro knockout.
[133:00.01]Nice catch.
[133:22.13]Ah, I thought I was gonna bounce around the other side.
[133:23.75]Shit.
[133:23.97]I thought I was gonna go to the left.
[133:32.83]Shit.
[133:33.99]Oh, I'm in trouble here.
[133:35.13]I'm in trouble.
[133:41.11]Come on, I'm on my last leg here.
[134:08.40]Quit hardcore tryharding.
[134:10.96]That's what you have to do in this game.
[134:12.64]This is... Why would you tryhard in the comedy game?
[134:16.82]That's what I don't get.
[134:26.74]No.
[134:27.32]Are you ready?
[134:36.54]That's not what I meant and you know it.
[134:38.33]I don't know what you meant still.
[134:39.69]I still don't get it.
[134:41.19]Quit taking my words out of fucking comedy context, okay?
[134:47.51]Bam!
[134:48.51]Bam!
[134:49.61]Bam!
[134:57.22]Ow.
[135:03.52]Shit.
[135:04.30]It's always the worst when you're right in the middle.
[135:06.92]Or you can move.
[135:15.14]Oh, you saw that coming from a mile away, didn't you?
[135:29.04]Oh my god.
[135:31.69]What the hell?
[135:32.57]What the fuck?
[135:34.39]That like did a full circle and came backwards.
[135:42.13]grabbed it I did oh I think I think gamer exhaustion is starting to get in here I don't know what happened I think you grabbed it out of my hand I caught it like right after you hit it I caught it
[136:12.91]Ow!
[136:13.41]My joints!
[136:16.53]I need to drink a stamina potion.
[136:20.12]God, if only those existed in real life.
[136:22.00]Come get some.
[136:39.16]Oh, come on.
[136:40.20]You bastard.
[136:41.24]You timed it.
[136:42.08]You waited for it and you clicked it.
[136:44.25]You clicked the button and it was it.
[136:48.39]You got stamina potions over there.
[136:50.03]I don't have any here.
[136:50.67]Dude, I took a stamina potion right before this.
[136:54.74]And you had the stamina coffee.
[136:57.05]Did you not?
[136:57.69]No, but... But stamina coffee puts you up to, like, 100% stamina.
[137:03.61]But then your drain rate is, like, plus 100%.
[137:05.49]What are you... You're doing drugs?
[137:08.29]I put up to 100% stamina.
[137:11.58]What?
[137:13.06]The Jerma that lived in Boston didn't do drugs.
[137:18.92]Why are you bringing this back here?
[137:19.80]I don't know.
[137:21.12]I had fun doing this.
[137:30.44]Drugs are bad.
[137:31.02]I don't do drugs.
[137:35.28]Don't listen to this dweeb.
[137:36.52]Oh, it's the beach ball again?
[137:37.60]I didn't even realize.
[137:38.71]I didn't mean to have a beach ball.
[137:46.09]You're not even going to respond to the fact that he's called you a dweeb?
[137:48.57]I don't have a problem with that.
[137:54.51]Oh, you dweeb.
[138:01.43]I just blunted it for you.
[138:02.44]Damn.
[138:14.66]This beat is pumping!
[138:18.95]Uh, can I score a point?
[138:20.89]Real fast?
[138:21.39]I can't.
[138:21.89]I tried.
[138:23.23]Should I?
[138:23.99]Should you?
[138:24.53]I mean, there.
[138:25.05]Yeah, I'd let you do it.
[138:25.97]I was like, you know, it's time for him to get one.
[138:32.76]Ah, too bad it wasn't at the right spot.
[138:40.59]Ah.
[138:51.53]Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[138:53.63]Give me one night, fuck, give me.
[138:58.27]No.
[139:14.10]Oh, going for a little move there.
[139:18.15]Oh, just out of reach.
[139:19.67]Fucking beach ball.
[139:21.17]No!
[139:21.45]Actually, with beach ball, if you had two people, I don't know how you'd ever score.
[139:43.89]That would be very hard.
[139:45.61]Nice.
[139:46.37]Once you have some superb extreme humor.
[139:49.07]Donor spotted.
[139:49.87]Nice.
[139:56.28]Okay.
[139:56.98]He's finally getting into it, isn't he?
[139:58.56]I'm getting the comeback.
[139:59.36]I'm not coming back.
[140:15.79]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[140:23.79]Damn!
[140:24.57]I was waiting for the defense, but I couldn't get it.
[140:35.28]No!
[140:40.94]Shit!
[140:41.52]I tried to blunt it up higher so you couldn't get it.
[140:58.29]Just a little too high.
[140:59.39]Oh, I can't believe you grabbed it a second time.
[141:02.31]Oh, that was it?
[141:04.01]That was it.
[141:09.99]What game mode?
[141:10.55]What's the situation?
[141:11.31]What are we doing?
[141:13.17]I don't know.
[141:13.61]What do you think?
[141:14.81]I like that.
[141:16.55]You having fun?
[141:17.47]I like that.
[141:19.64]How long have we been... I mean, my stream turned off.
[141:22.14]I turned off my stream accidentally.
[141:23.96]Two hours, 22 minutes.
[141:33.88]2-2-2.
[141:38.73]You cheated super hard there.
[141:40.91]What, because I bumped it?
[141:47.58]I just passed it to you.
[141:52.48]This with four people would be, I think, actually really hard to score a goal.
[141:56.92]It would be just pretty random.
[141:58.45]Yeah.
[142:00.55]It'd be a lot of mashing next to the goalpost and getting parries, I assume.
[142:04.91]It'd actually be kind of doable with the baseball, though.
[142:13.22]Mm-hmm.
[142:20.88]Wow, I thought that was too low.
[142:24.62]Play Lego Island.
[142:26.65]What?
[142:42.65]That's just too much.
[142:49.35]I will never give up trying to get me to play LEGO Island.
[143:00.64]Can you guys play Lethal League Blaze?
[143:02.96]I don't know.
[143:06.80]I set myself up for that one.
[143:17.54]I'm facing the fucking wrong way.
[143:19.00]What the hell am I doing?
[143:29.27]Shit.
[143:31.83]I'd be down for Lego Island, to be honest.
[143:37.09]Lego Island.
[143:39.41]I don't think I can even run that game on my fucking computer.
[143:42.75]Uh-oh.
[143:49.57]Whoops-a-daisy.
[143:50.75]Whoops-a-daisy.
[143:52.75]Dino-dino-dino-dinosaur.
[144:09.00]Do it like you do drugs.
[144:18.27]Yeah, when you get next to the next sometimes, it's hard to even tell what happened there.
[144:22.87]I really thought you were going to hit it up.
[144:31.16]Ooh.
[144:36.88]OK.
[144:37.06]Alright.
[144:37.76]Nice.
[144:52.66]Now that's that he has a snort he mode Oh God Frank So what's what's the deal?
[145:08.00]What's what do you want to keep doing this one?
[145:10.58]I enjoy this Okay, I'm gonna change character.
[145:13.83]Ah, never mind I'm not gonna change character
[145:19.39]It's a very engaging, you know, tug of war.
[145:24.37]It's a very engaging game.
[145:25.89]Tug of war back and forth.
[145:40.82]I was like trying to wait for you to do it.
[145:42.46]Yeah, I was trying to wait for you to do it.
[145:44.53]We're getting to that next level.
[145:45.53]He's going to do it.
[145:48.57]Oh, you suck.
[145:54.24]Ooh.
[145:57.02]That ability sucks.
[145:57.90]You already had enough to use that?
[146:00.56]Yeah.
[146:08.74]You suck, dude.
[146:12.32]You suck!
[146:14.80]I'm gonna do like the form.
[146:15.94]Formation.
[146:20.91]Oh!
[146:24.36]You suck.
[146:25.14]You suck.
[146:29.08]What a fucking move.
[146:45.61]That move is so good.
[146:54.48]Okay, see now that I'm close to losing, everyone knows from Soul Calibur that now's when we try.
[146:59.24]Now's when we come back and we kick your ass.
[147:03.93]And maybe I'll go there and kick your ass.
[147:08.11]Here's where it really balls to the walls.
[147:12.26]Maybe you'll see me on the battlefield in Smash to kick your ass.
[147:34.28]Learning from the master I see Does that thing just auto target No, I have to aim it I have to like actually aim the thing Nothing escapes my watch
[147:59.20]Press Q to make Candyman's mouth move.
[148:01.18]I'm using a controller.
[148:02.02]Was it on controller?
[148:02.84]Are you using controller?
[148:03.88]Yeah.
[148:05.08]Okay, just make sure we're on the same level here.
[148:06.88]I mean, you could have used, like, the... I'm using keyboard and mouse, like, to your advantage.
[148:12.78]You know what I mean?
[148:15.17]How would you play this game reliably with keyboard and mouse?
[148:17.59]I feel like that'd be very hard.
[148:18.45]Just do it.
[148:23.51]Just do it.
[148:25.17]Nike, just do it.
[148:36.64]Oh, I got to use that better.
[148:42.76]Really?
[148:43.04]No.
[148:50.77]Oh, shit.
[148:58.07]That's why we're playing the cheap ass.
[148:59.85]Alright.
[149:00.75]Let's see.
[149:02.51]I got to be ready for that one.
[149:07.73]And you're just gonna teleport it inside the gold?
[149:15.92]No, fuck, oh no.
[149:17.54]Okay, I gotta watch your special leader.
[149:19.10]Oh, I let go of it too early.
[149:26.02]Damn.
[149:26.30]Uh-oh.
[149:43.62]Hold on.
[149:45.66]I'm trying to figure out what actually makes me climb it.
[149:50.95]Can I do that?
[149:51.89]No, it's his thing.
[149:53.57]I can climb up it, but he falls off and it's really weird.
[149:55.95]I don't know, maybe I can't stand on the scoreboard.
[150:10.75]I don't know if I can even get it from you at that point.
[150:14.01]Maybe not.
[150:18.77]Oh, fuck.
[150:21.89]Fuck.
[150:23.17]Oh, fuck!
[150:48.30]Not this time I was trying so hard to pay attention to it Wow No
[151:17.82]This is so stupid now.
[151:21.82]It really is.
[151:22.34]We're just like doing the thing to each other.
[151:25.95]I'll gain meter faster than you'll gain meter.
[151:32.45]Oh, it's too much.
[151:46.87]Oh no!
[151:59.97]Almost tied it up, come on now.
[152:03.22]Oh fuck.
[152:07.04]Tied it up for me.
[152:07.60]I did it the wrong way, I did it the wrong way, I did it the wrong way.
[152:16.89]Alright, let's do it.
[152:28.06]You son of a bitch.
[152:30.36]I should have known you were just gaming meter there.
[152:33.45]You fucking threw me out of the bus.
[152:44.84]Good game.
[152:51.35]This is all for the curtains?
[152:52.33]Yeah, we gotta tally up every single win and loss.
[152:54.99]Well, then I obviously win.
[153:01.41]Let's go with... Who else would be fun in this mode?
[153:04.43]Are we still playing this mode?
[153:05.49]What's the other one that we didn't do?
[153:09.68]Did we do all the game modes?
[153:13.06]Maybe go back to original?
[153:15.28]It's dark in here.
[153:16.12]I gotta turn the fucking lights on.
[153:22.43]I heard what Switch does, but I've played him a lot before.
[153:24.59]There we go.
[153:31.83]Turn on the lights.
[153:32.55]There they are.
[153:35.73]Hey, there they are.
[153:40.76]Is this regular mode?
[153:42.20]We're doing regular mode?
[153:50.84]Oh yeah, he can like hit it over his head behind him.
[153:53.84]That was his thing.
[153:57.04]Oh, somebody said press Q?
[153:58.14]Well, I'm not gonna do that.
[154:00.05]I'm in the middle of an intense video game right now.
[154:07.53]I remember that.
[154:13.41]Oh, I just, my brain just goes to it.
[154:22.33]I forget what Switchflip is even doing.
[154:23.79]When you do a special, what does it do?
[154:28.71]Do you know?
[154:29.05]I don't know.
[154:31.46]Hey, do you see in the back right at the top of the screen in the background?
[154:36.28]I know you can't look right now, but TF2!
[154:38.72]Play TF2!
[154:39.12]Is that what it says?
[154:41.24]That's what it says.
[154:43.13]Got the logo.
[154:43.87]Oh, it's the Team Fortress logo.
[154:53.21]Is that what that is?
[154:54.07]Is that an homage?
[154:55.71]What else would it be?
[154:57.49]I think you may have found a fucking pretty cool homage, dude.
[154:59.37]Oh, you see that blimp in the background?
[155:05.62]Please play TF2.
[155:09.34]That's what the aliens, the monsters, the robots come out of in Man vs Machine.
[155:19.47]Ow.
[155:21.83]Oh my lord.
[155:24.47]Oh my lord!
[155:25.40]I just watched myself get hit by fucking four cars in a row.
[155:32.24]Oh man, do you see that baseball?
[155:33.40]Remember the Sandman?
[155:40.01]No, you have to make all the references to Fortnite now.
[155:42.43]That's how it works.
[155:43.15]Oh, Fortnite?
[155:43.75]Do you use a default Fortnite dance?
[155:47.83]No, that's been vetoed.
[155:50.55]That has been vetoed.
[155:51.75]Hey, pick stage landing tilted towers.
[156:03.42]That was a good initial.
[156:04.98]You did a good initial there, man.
[156:06.90]But was it enough?
[156:08.50]No.
[156:09.31]I'm too big.
[156:10.05]I'm too big.
[156:20.44]That's what we call a perfect forward smash.
[156:23.04]If his super wasn't dumb.
[156:24.26]Are you sure you're doing it right?
[156:28.96]Are you sure there's not something else you need to do?
[156:30.44]I'm sure.
[156:31.74]Wow.
[156:38.63]Oh, though he does get... Okay.
[156:41.27]I'm kind of understanding.
[156:42.23]Okay.
[156:43.95]Wait, you can fly?
[156:44.95]You can fly?
[156:45.57]I can fly.
[156:52.71]That's really weird.
[156:53.55]I can fly!
[156:54.25]I can fly!
[156:54.95]Do you have to tap, uh... Just tap A or anything?
[156:58.03]Just hold A and I'm flying.
[157:09.07]Oh, shit.
[157:09.41]Oh, shit.
[157:11.43]Oh, I got hit in the same head.
[157:13.83]He's so weird though.
[157:24.58]Oh, I didn't want to taunt.
[157:30.27]Fuck.
[157:33.69]Well, here it is.
[157:58.66]That was close.
[157:59.85]Can you parry without full meter?
[158:01.45]I was worried about it.
[158:02.29]I was like, wait, he doesn't have full.
[158:03.33]I don't know what the rules are here.
[158:04.49]I know it drains your meter, but I didn't know if you need to have the full one.
[158:09.63]I don't know.
[158:09.89]That's a good question.
[158:12.89]Someone's asking, is there an option for it to be one hit, like the first game?
[158:17.61]Can you make it one hit and you're out?
[158:21.02]Or is it only HP?
[158:27.90]Wait, what did you ask?
[158:29.86]I said, is there an option to make it like the original game?
[158:32.64]Oh, yeah, there is.
[158:34.04]Oh, you can.
[158:34.89]Yeah.
[158:36.41]Would you like it that way?
[158:37.23]We can do an outcome.
[158:57.98]the rocket my brain broke it's the rocket and he's gonna build it over there aren't you
[159:28.51]I don't think I like this man.
[159:30.17]He's just not for me.
[159:31.88]He seems a little slow.
[159:50.91]Ooh, alright.
[159:52.23]So yeah, so it goes just right to the other person.
[159:54.39]Yeah.
[159:55.23]But people were telling me that you can bunt out of it so that you don't always know that it's going to come get you, and that helps make them better.
[160:01.15]Ooh.
[160:16.32]Ooh, I was a little confused on exactly what happened there.
[160:31.99]Ooh.
[160:34.32]Ooh.
[160:34.84]Good.
[160:53.79]we haven't seen this one yet there's two balls it's two balls at the same time somebody said there's a dev in the chats real is that is that or are we just getting yeah no I made this
[161:25.49]Don't you remember like the last couple of months where I've been putting like dev updates to you?
[161:30.67]I've been snail mailing them to you.
[161:33.13]Do you not read them?
[161:33.89]Yeah.
[161:34.91]No, I mean I just kind of put them on like the counter.
[161:40.43]I think I opened one of them.
[161:41.39]I thought it was just bills or something.
[161:46.59]Oh, you turned it on.
[161:47.49]Alright.
[161:47.81]Wow.
[161:53.86]Now we get to prove just how bad we really are.
[161:55.74]Now we have to play like gods.
[162:11.63]Oh, I bunted it and it immediately killed me.
[162:14.82]Bunt!
[162:35.52]Oh, shit!
[162:36.36]You bounced it!
[162:37.52]He bounced it!
[162:38.58]Yeah, he bounced it, man.
[162:45.05]Oh, my lord.
[162:45.65]What?
[162:48.21]Oh, I had it.
[163:08.05]Oh, is there like a delay after you throw?
[163:10.71]It's like you do an actual throw animation.
[163:27.02]Ah, damn.
[163:30.67]Okay, I need the dev to confirm that my character actually says aya and cho.
[163:39.13]Is he actually saying Cho or am I hearing things?
[163:44.95]Damn it, I tried to grab it out of midair and I was being a little funky.
[163:59.71]Why didn't you just... You just made the I got hit and died noise.
[164:02.46]No, I didn't.
[164:03.82]You did.
[164:06.82]I'm dead.
[164:08.55]definitely saying that's all I need to know never heard any elderly Chinese players say cho uh cho is like good ball and cho lee is good ball again you hear a lot in competitive like tournaments that's interesting like good point well game point match point here it comes
[164:43.85]Good game.
[164:44.51]Good game.
[164:45.15]Good game.
[164:45.91]Alright, what do you say?
[164:59.18]What do I do?
[165:00.55]I like that a lot.
[165:01.71]I just want to make it more points because it's quick.
[165:05.19]I put points to 12.
[165:08.67]Yeah, I'm going to talk about the green screen after we play Lethal League Blaze, the new game.
[165:15.15]New Lethal League.
[165:16.93]It's very fun.
[165:18.05]I'm going to try so hard.
[165:21.29]How much is this game?
[165:22.41]What's the price point on this one?
[165:23.93]I don't remember.
[165:25.21]I thought it was like 20.
[165:32.08]Nice.
[165:32.38]20 bucks?
[165:32.66]20 bucks?
[165:41.15]We got a fucking endless amount of activity here.
[165:44.03]Holy fuck, that was much faster than I thought it was.
[165:50.38]Oh my god, I bunted it down just so you could kill me.
[165:54.12]Me too.
[165:56.40]Just like that, yeah.
[165:58.24]Just like that.
[166:02.50]Oh, fuck.
[166:08.62]Okay, try it.
[166:14.63]I'm trying to, like, Legend of Zelda to you.
[166:17.69]Oh my god.
[166:18.21]I'm trying to do the Link down smash.
[166:25.00]What the fuck happened to me?
[166:26.36]Because I served it at parried, Bobby.
[166:50.79]I didn't even see you hit it a second time.
[166:53.73]I did my special.
[166:54.65]Remember, my special comes out and then comes back in.
[166:59.29]Ooh, nice.
[167:02.76]Excellent work.
[167:05.34]What?
[167:06.26]Why?
[167:07.14]I don't know.
[167:07.52]I punted the shit out of that.
[167:16.70]That second was much faster than I thought it would be.
[167:24.71]handcuff man this guy's fun man okay spy party spy party spy party ow oh my god you jumped I was like he's gonna hit it down uh like that and okay Jesus Christ alright
[167:55.43]oh my god she's like we're like random random xp no I'm telling you it's gamer fatigue gamer fatigue no it's just it's gamer fatigue man you're gonna let me pogo this it's not mine oh my god what am I doing over here I'm trying to like steal the ball from you
[168:34.86]oh my god are you telling me you really aim those because that's just like it feels like exactly wherever I am I just hook shot at you it's called the sniper it's never like it's never slightly off it's always just right where it needs to be
[169:02.48]Spy party.
[169:03.30]Spy party.
[169:04.22]Spy... I don't even have spy party on this computer.
[169:21.09]What?
[169:23.03]I had full meter.
[169:23.97]I parry.
[169:24.71]I think if you parry somebody else, you get full meter.
[169:34.89]Ay-yah, indeed.
[169:36.07]This is why this character embodies me.
[169:38.71]Ooh, that was... Ding.
[169:47.51]Boop.
[170:12.53]Oh, it really is like a Falcon Punch.
[170:14.15]I get it.
[170:18.93]Attention Jerm reviewers.
[170:20.01]No, I'm not reading that.
[170:28.60]Shit.
[170:30.60]I'm not reading that.
[170:43.92]Oof, I didn't know you had it.
[170:47.26]Yeah, if you hit it, like, before you get the final one, that counts as your final hit.
[170:51.87]So if you're on three bars, your next hit will be enough to use it.
[170:55.49]Oh, I see.
[170:59.51]Damn, he's getting on to me, fellas.
[171:01.85]He's on to me, fellas and lads.
[171:04.04]Fellas and ladies.
[171:05.04]Fellas and lads.
[171:12.96]Fuck.
[171:18.86]Oh boy, I'm just throwing.
[171:21.08]I'm throwing it here.
[171:22.02]Oh man.
[171:27.18]The bunting in front of people.
[171:28.59]Not a good idea.
[171:32.39]Whatever that was, not a good idea.
[171:34.43]I don't know.
[171:34.77]It's gamer fatigue.
[171:41.05]Gamer fatigue, man.
[171:41.56]That's gamer fatigue.
[171:43.14]It's just fucking gamer fatigue.
[171:46.38]Gamer fatigue.
[171:54.06]Sometimes the throws surprise Golly what the hell looks like a super ball I
[172:31.31]need one point I thought you could like throw it I thought you're gonna do the thing where you just try to blanket on me very quickly I'm gonna try to throw it back is there actually the one character we hadn't seen have we we have I don't have a box and you yeah there's there's one other guy right is there I mean there's the this oh oh yeah then we have some
[173:03.18]Let's try somebody else.
[173:06.69]I'm gonna pick baseball guy.
[173:07.95]What's his special?
[173:08.63]What is baseball man special?
[173:11.19]I don't know.
[173:11.65]He spins and hits and then it does nothing.
[173:15.47]Huh.
[173:16.70]Sounds fun.
[173:19.86]I can't remember.
[173:20.80]I used to play him a lot.
[173:21.82]So I remember being good, but I don't, yeah.
[173:24.52]I think it just goes faster.
[173:42.52]Jesus.
[173:43.08]Fuck, man.
[173:44.00]I didn't know you were going to activate it.
[173:59.29]Oh, my God.
[173:59.87]That was the most embarrassing round.
[174:02.86]Even worse than the volleyball earlier.
[174:05.22]It's gamer fatigue.
[174:07.42]I learned this from you.
[174:12.07]That would have been ultra ultra gamer embarrassment Jesus Oh, I jumped into it you like hit it up like
[174:43.10]What the fuck am I doing here?
[174:53.73]Wow.
[174:54.83]That was quick.
[174:55.85]Yeah.
[175:06.05]Oh, man.
[175:06.55]I just threw you.
[175:08.24]Yeah, I didn't turn around.
[175:09.62]I just threw you over there.
[175:27.00]Nice.
[175:34.33]Whoa.
[175:36.03]I think he can just go any direction and it goes faster.
[175:39.09]Yeah.
[175:41.76]God damn it.
[175:42.30]What the fuck am I thinking?
[175:43.28]I just keep trying to go for that bonehead play.
[176:05.04]Is Jermaine even trying anymore?
[176:06.54]Yeah.
[176:06.90]Oh, Jesus.
[176:11.46]Damn.
[176:38.03]You got that twice in a row, didn't you?
[176:39.27]Oh, I'm surprised I didn't get that.
[176:47.88]Kind of right where I was swinging.
[176:57.32]Fuck.
[176:58.02]I was waiting for it.
[177:02.45]Oh my god.
[177:05.97]Oh, it didn't work.
[177:19.30]Nice fucking play!
[177:20.72]I was... I knew it!
[177:24.50]I should have just backed off.
[177:26.14]Dinked him.
[177:34.23]I'm trying to grab it in mid-air.
[177:49.85]Nice.
[177:54.65]Grabbing from a parry is more difficult than it seems.
[177:57.95]Yeah.
[177:58.59]Yeah.
[178:00.53]Recuperate from gamer fatigue.
[178:03.29]Recuperating from gamer fatigue is more difficult than it seems.
[178:07.53]Come back to you.
[178:11.95]Got my controller unplugged.
[178:17.82]You can bait parries.
[178:18.74]Yeah.
[178:20.50]Yeah, there's a lot of trickery.
[178:21.94]Do you remember what this girl's thing was?
[178:24.66]You used her a second ago.
[178:26.42]I don't even remember.
[178:27.42]I don't think I even got a chance to use her special.
[178:29.52]I was so bad.
[178:33.88]Do you know that you can bunt out of your special?
[178:36.95]Does it consume the special?
[178:38.63]Yeah.
[178:40.13]So while you're in the middle, you can just bunt.
[178:42.77]Interesting.
[178:56.36]Damn it.
[179:05.97]What the fuck is going on?
[179:07.63]What happened here?
[179:09.23]What?
[179:09.51]Are you still here?
[179:10.35]Yeah.
[179:11.01]What the fuck?
[179:11.79]Is that your move?
[179:12.55]Her move changed.
[179:13.75]I remember it changes the direction a couple times.
[179:16.47]No, no.
[179:16.90]I mean, there's like a dummy here of you.
[179:18.60]I don't know what you're talking about.
[179:20.14]Oh, well...
[179:23.92]I thought you put a dummy here.
[179:25.36]No.
[179:26.50]Oh, well.
[179:27.28]Oh, well.
[179:33.89]Oh, that's what it is.
[179:38.19]Okay, now you're off the screen.
[179:46.61]Shit.
[179:51.85]That was just a bad program.
[179:55.53]It really does feel like it, didn't it?
[180:00.67]Oof.
[180:03.75]One of you hundred devs needs to be... A hundred devs?
[180:06.65]Yeah, can you believe they have a hundred dev team?
[180:08.49]Damn it.
[180:17.00]I'm so panicking over that shit.
[180:31.51]Shit, I'm holding it down now.
[180:41.35]Oh lord, I'm slowing down.
[180:43.39]I'm slowing down.
[180:45.17]Oh my god, I thought I was you because we're both beautiful women.
[181:15.79]I programmed the cars in the background.
[181:17.43]Nice job, man.
[181:36.33]Stage is like this.
[181:37.35]I don't know.
[181:37.83]There's some of the stages that the wiggling back and forth is I Can't I can't I can't man.
[181:43.32]I don't like the stage with one Yeah, well you see just saved my life no, no, you're right Oh Jesus
[182:12.50]I just wanna get a hand on it.
[182:14.76]I just wanna touch it.
[182:26.57]Ah!
[182:27.27]Shit, I thought it was gonna go the other way!
[182:29.14]Down instead of up!
[182:54.15]Oh my god.
[182:55.79]Sometimes you gotta stop moving.
[182:58.67]Just slow down.
[182:59.29]It's like, you know when people are like, I don't... Never mind.
[183:01.27]Just... You might want to move a little bit.
[183:22.72]Sonic Boom!
[183:27.28]Shit.
[183:27.68]You fooled me.
[183:28.48]You fooled me.
[183:29.30]Fooled him.
[183:34.64]You fooled me.
[183:36.70]Level 23.
[183:47.17]You fooled me.
[183:50.33]Knockout.
[183:52.17]Piece of cake.
[183:54.27]You shot lucky.
[183:54.75]What is wrong with you?
[183:55.37]That's the... That's the punch out.
[183:56.41]There's only one good character.
[183:58.07]Ping pong guy.
[183:59.19]That was when you beat somebody in punch out.
[184:01.09]Look it up.
[184:25.41]You beat someone in Punch Out?
[184:43.06]Oh, come on, really?
[184:44.04]How did you get rid of that one?
[184:47.01]So you were doing it.
[184:49.50]That didn't sound anything like it.
[184:50.92]I'll play it in a second.
[184:52.40]What the hell?
[184:53.00]Why was it floating to me?
[184:54.52]It floated to me.
[184:55.44]Because after a second, it floats to you.
[184:59.71]Come on, bro.
[185:06.93]What's happening with my body?
[185:07.77]I think it was because... Oh, I was in the middle of a special.
[185:10.71]Yeah, you were in the special, so you still had a lock on it.
[185:12.94]Alright.
[185:17.93]You're just, like, Binding of Isaac me with a fucking item that's, like, aerial.
[185:21.03]You know what I'm saying?
[185:22.59]No, I have no idea what you're saying, actually.
[185:25.48]You walked into me with, like, Band-Aid girl.
[185:27.90]Oh.
[185:31.48]See?
[185:31.74]That's, like, what?
[185:32.52]What the fuck, man?
[185:33.72]I'm going to stop doing that to you.
[185:42.46]Try it.
[185:48.03]It's pretty rough.
[185:51.13]No, that sucks.
[185:58.68]Oh, here I come.
[186:00.18]Yeah, orbitable damage.
[186:01.46]Orbital damage.
[186:02.32]Orbitable?
[186:14.87]When does The Binding of Isaac come?
[186:17.34]Expansion coming out soon, right?
[186:20.02]When does Diablo Immortal come out?
[186:22.74]I can't wait.
[186:24.68]Who knows?
[186:28.75]When does 2B come out?
[186:31.99]2B?
[186:32.65]2B in Soul Calibur.
[186:38.01]We're playing this really, really just boring, aren't we?
[186:40.87]Yeah.
[186:45.67]I walk a ball into you and then you die.
[186:47.07]I would probably get you a ball.
[186:51.31]Hey, I'm playing a win.
[186:53.53]Oh my god, bad fucking throw.
[186:57.57]2B?
[186:58.61]Wait, 2B from near Autonomica?
[187:01.21]Yeah, near Autonomica is going to fight Geralt of Skyrim.
[187:05.83]Wait, Geralt is in Soulcalibur?
[187:07.49]Yeah.
[187:08.75]Is he really?
[187:09.16]Yeah.
[187:10.80]No, be honest with me here.
[187:12.30]He is, yeah.
[187:14.44]That's pretty cool.
[187:30.24]Wrong direction.
[187:33.92]You'll see.
[187:47.38]No, get out of here.
[187:52.30]Oh my, that is so deceiving!
[187:55.16]Why is the second throw like 10 times faster?
[187:58.74]It just is.
[188:01.12]That was the cheesiest, shittiest game ever.
[188:04.06]That's why you have to regulate it and play volleyball.
[188:09.05]Alright, how about let's do one more volleyball.
[188:12.83]And then I need to talk to my stream about green screen stuff, okay?
[188:16.31]Yeah, okay.
[188:16.79]Then I need to talk to my stream about... Are you going to go to soil caliber after this?
[188:23.14]No.
[188:23.56]I wasn't going to stream that.
[188:27.61]Let's get it.
[188:28.07]Let's talk about cute boys.
[188:30.49]Yeah, we're just going to talk about cute boys and food.
[188:32.91]This is StarGuys, if you just don't know.

[198:07.54]Yeah.
[198:09.16]When I was looking at the rules, it was weird.

[198:14.14]Let's go.
[198:14.52]It said rest at a three.
[198:17.94]That was stamped by a notary.

[199:07.11]That was bullshit.
[199:17.90]That was over the net.
[199:43.73]I thought you were gonna do the thing where it spins around and goes the other way.
[199:45.63]Nope.
[199:45.73]I thought you were gonna do your special.
[199:53.28]Where you gonna go?
[199:53.86]Where you gonna go?
[199:55.08]I only had one hit.
[199:56.12]There's no way to get it over.
[199:57.18]Okay.

[202:08.60]You gonna have anything left in your room before we're done here?
[202:11.06]It's actually insane how the tension is boiling in this best-of-seven set.
[202:19.66]You gonna have anything left in there?
[202:23.36]You'd be surprised how little you need.
[202:26.21]You need food, water, and winning.

[205:27.42]What?
[205:28.24]Oh, that's excuse!

[205:47.85]What the fuck, dude?
[205:48.51]My controller!
[205:54.07]Looks like I won seven.
[205:58.46]For everyone keeping track at home.
[206:00.98]It's like I'm ahead by four.
[206:11.05]Two free points.
[206:12.11]It's still lost.
[206:13.21]Hey, it was a series.
[206:14.81]I won the series two times in a row.
[206:16.99]Three times in a row, actually.
[206:18.91]Best out of three.
[206:19.61]Best out of five.
[206:20.91]Best out of seven.
[206:21.83]Looks like I'm in the lead.
[206:25.95]If it's best of seven, I've already won.
[206:29.67]Oh my god.
[206:30.83]I've already won.
[206:31.79]It's already over.
[206:39.78]You know what?
[206:41.42]There's fucking water all over me.
[206:47.72]You're dumping water on me.
[206:50.66]You're not going to recover from this shit.
[206:55.93]No way.
[206:56.51]He didn't turn.
[206:57.13]Because if you try and turn too hard, you just slam it into the ground.
[207:12.68]I was so good.
[207:13.56]That was so good and I fucking blew it at the end.
[207:17.58]It was so easy What the fuck

[209:04.03]The next game wins.
[209:05.29]No, I quit.
[209:06.97]I don't know how many series I have to win when you keep extending them.
[209:20.75]I mean, it just comes down to just getting in the right moment and the right mindset.
[209:27.37]Timing your shots.
[209:28.75]Carefully.
[209:29.27]Fundamentals.
[209:30.96]He left the Discord, by the way.

[209:35.00]He's not here anymore.
[209:36.24]He left.
[209:38.16]He turned his stream off.
[209:41.12]Wait, what?
[209:43.12]Why?
[209:46.59]Why did you turn off his stream?

[214:26.00]Okay, so you want to see just how much this game takes out of me?
[214:33.09]I'm like so sweaty and greasy right now.
[214:34.81]It's like unbelievable.
[214:37.71]Turn this on.
[214:42.07]Here.
[214:44.12]Turn this off.
[214:46.56]Let's get that off.
[214:47.42]I'll take this out too.
[214:51.80]Like, look at this shit.
[214:53.36]It's insane.
[214:55.89]Take a look under my eye.
[214:58.15]This is just water.
[214:59.31]That's not a shadow, guys.
[215:00.75]That's water.
[215:03.88]Look at that.
[215:05.54]This is like heavy under here.
[215:06.80]It weighs a shitload.
[215:09.44]Check out this side, though.
[215:11.53]It's like I'm just sitting here like...
[215:17.12]I'm wet I worked out. I could walk like-
[215:20.12]When I talked to Kim I could tell her I was like doing push-ups in here for like fucking three or four hours and she'd be like: Oh wow- wow you really look- you've been working out.
[215:29.12]I don't need to go to the fucking gym.
[215:31.12]But anyways uh let's get this back off and um let me transition well actually I don't I can just keep this on.
[215:40.17]So let's talk about the green screen.
[215:41.88]For those of you that don't know, I'm just going to be this cube in the middle.
[215:47.91]Yeah, that's fine.
[215:49.89]I don't want to use too much internet.
[215:50.99]So for those of you that don't know, there is a... Thank you for sharing.
[215:55.89]You're very welcome.
[215:57.61]So next week, I'm going to do a stream where I get in front of a green screen.
[216:03.82]And I'm going to do potentially 150 to 200 separate actions.
[216:10.60]So originally, the plan was I was going to have a voting period.
[216:16.08]And it was going to be secret where I didn't know what you guys were suggesting.
[216:19.84]But I've changed the rules a little bit because that's- it's just not gonna happen.
[216:24.00]There were there were like I think 1500 plus different suggestions in that channel, in the Discord.
[216:29.00]So it was like there was no way I was reliably gonna just be like: Oh hey mods, hey can you do like fucking-
[216:35.00]And if there's props involved I need to know what they are so I can buy them, you know what I mean?
[216:38.00]I need to know what these- what these things are, so if I need to know what they are so I can buy them, you know what I mean?
[216:44.00]I need to know what these what these things are so I'm able to do them.
[216:47.34]So what I did is I went through myself and I did a pre-screening.
[216:52.57]Essentially, I went through every single submission in that channel.
[216:57.17]And it was, oh, we're going to make a poll.
[217:00.08]We're going to make a voting.
[217:01.04]There's not going to be any voting for all the actions.
[217:03.72]I'm just going to take the ones that I like.
[217:05.66]The audio is out of sync.
[217:07.20]Oh, it's because of PlayStation 4.
[217:08.42]Here, let me do this.
[217:12.01]It is because of the PS4.
[217:29.26]the mic has been out of sync the entire stream hasn't it it had to have been yeah no there's no way that it wasn't out of sync the whole stream
[217:53.46]Was I like responding to things Star was saying like two full seconds before he said them?
[218:04.26]So wait, hold on a second.
[218:05.48]I've been like a full second behind.
[218:10.28]It was fine?
[218:10.80]Alright.
[218:14.60]it seemed fine alright well that my microphone was 650 milliseconds behind so he would say something and it would take me almost a full second to respond to it but as long as it uh as long as it wasn't that noticeable it was just stuck there from the PlayStation 4 when when it did Red Dead it still seems off it should not be yeah I'm at zero here and the camera's at zero
[218:45.89]Is it?
[218:48.92]Yeah, it's fine.
[218:49.96]But anyways.
[218:53.14]The... Let's go back.
[218:54.68]Well, hopefully that wasn't fucking horrible to watch.
[218:59.03]Sorry about that.
[219:00.67]You know, it's been kind of crazy here with the internet.
[219:02.99]So, I saw green and stepped on the fucking gas.
[219:06.49]Didn't even think about it.
[219:07.27]It was just like, green, internet's green, go.
[219:09.60]So, sorry about that.
[219:11.30]Anyways.
[219:14.05]uh talk about the green screen right so instead of having it be a period where everybody votes and I don't know in secret I just I went through and I picked out the ones that I think I want to do and I narrowed it down to about 120 130 plus actions there's going to be one poll so the poll is going to be what meme shit you guys want me to do because there was a lot of meme shit and I don't even want I don't even want to talk about them so there's going to be a poll
[219:45.10]with all the memes on it.
[219:47.00]I've already vetoed three of them.
[219:49.02]So you'll get to see it over the next day here.
[219:52.48]So I'm going to put a poll in the Discord.
[219:55.52]I'll give it to one of the mods.
[219:56.50]I'll put it in the general.
[219:57.40]That's where it's going to be.
[219:58.44]I haven't made it yet, so that's why it's not here.
[220:01.18]And there's no more suggestions as of tonight.
[220:04.24]So pretty much by the time this stream is over, five or six hours later, I'll probably tell like midnight Pacific, which would be 3 a.m.
[220:12.31]Eastern is when it's going to be just completely closed.
[220:15.70]I'm going to then a couple days later figure out exactly how I want to do it what I want to do and then you guys are going to be a poll that's going to be up for like three or four days before the stream happens from what mean is three meme shit that I get to do out of like 20 different options so we'll go we'll touch on that later please tell me you chose where there are a lot of great ones
[220:38.49]There are a lot of odd ones too, but you'll see soon enough.
[220:44.12]And because I got a little bit of time here to be able to actually explain all this, after the poll is closed and after it's ready to go,
[220:53.52]It's gonna be, after the stream happens, it's gonna be like full two full weeks before we even do anything else.
[221:00.64]So you'll have plenty of fucking time to be able to put together whatever you want.
[221:05.33]And the rules for that, I think I won't even talk about them until later.
[221:10.51]What's my personal favorite one?
[221:12.73]There's two of my... I'll tell you my two personal favorites because I just can't even imagine how stupid that it's going to be.
[221:19.23]Personal favorite number one is... Go limp on the ground, hear something, and pretend to be a toy from Toy Story.
[221:25.90]Like, that's... Like, that's fucking ridiculous.
[221:29.60]Go... Hear something and go limp.
[221:33.14]Like, I don't even know where you're going to put me there.
[221:35.26]And the second one is be in a bowl of cereal and avoid a toddler eating cereal from the bowl.
[221:45.74]Like, how am I supposed to even do that?
[221:51.34]There's hundreds of guys.
[221:53.19]Like, you think that that's it?
[221:55.09]And people were concerned.
[221:56.83]Let me squelch these concerns right away.
[221:59.09]A ton of people are like, oh, man, we're just going to get like a bunch of fucked up shit.
[222:02.75]Not going to be able to use.
[222:03.74]Oh, no, no.
[222:05.64]We're doing a full spread here, man.
[222:07.70]I am doing like standing.
[222:09.99]Blinking, walking, running, dodging, getting hit, getting hit in the shoulder, getting hit in the arm, getting hit in the shin, getting hit in the face.
[222:18.44]Like this is going to be a full nine.
[222:20.92]It's not going to be like, oh, I'm just going to like eat fucking bananas on stream.
[222:26.46]And then that's it.
[222:27.58]There you go, memers.
[222:29.34]Like, no.
[222:31.38]We're doing the whole thing.
[222:33.70]Like, oh, React scared.
[222:35.99]React scared plus.
[222:37.47]React scared plus plus.
[222:38.69]You know what I mean?
[222:39.15]Like, there's going to be plenty of options for you.
[222:42.11]And there's a ton of random fucking things that people have suggested that are going to be funny too.
[222:48.17]Sprites.
[222:48.75]Essentially, I'm making human sprites.
[222:50.43]That's right.
[222:52.44]And then a couple weeks later, we're going to do, it might even take two streams in a row to do a night where we sit around and we just hang out and we just play them.
[222:59.48]And there will be rules, by the way, based on that.
[223:01.52]I'm going to assume it's going to be, this is not set in stone, so it's not quite ready yet, but up to two minutes and at least 10 seconds.
[223:11.53]That has to be there.
[223:12.53]Because like I said, I was talking to the Discord the other day.
[223:15.23]I ain't going to have like 400 submissions that are just like,
[223:20.76]Like, no.
[223:22.22]It's got to be at least 10 seconds or up to 2 minutes.
[223:25.06]You know what I mean?
[223:27.83]Those actions are funny, but do we have anything to really add to the green screen?
[223:30.65]Oh, there's a lot of things that are going to be worthy of the green screen.
[223:35.09]There's at least 60 of these actions.
[223:37.77]They're going to be very fun.
[223:42.79]When was the sideburn patch?
[223:43.96]I fixed them.
[223:44.60]Look.
[223:45.50]See?
[223:46.60]Right there.
[223:48.54]Right there.
[223:49.00]Even.
[223:49.92]I fixed it.
[223:51.48]See, I fixed it.
[223:55.29]I told you guys I was gonna fix it.
[224:01.11]Can you do 10 bucks?
[224:03.65]Sure, it could be like,
[224:07.75]But I mean, is it gonna pass the pre-screening?
[224:10.09]Because all these member... Here's something, another thing that a lot of people might not understand.
[224:14.51]There's going to be a rigorous pre-screening on every single one of these submissions.
[224:19.85]And you only get to submit... I would probably assume we're gonna have a limit here.
[224:23.65]You can only submit like...
[224:25.33]two or three submissions because people will just diarrhea in like a hundred fucking submissions of random shit so we're gonna have very strict rules and if they don't follow the rules strictly strictly they're gonna just get thrown out because I cannot have a scenario where it's like do you know
[224:48.68]But, oh, guy stands in front of green screen.
[224:51.05]You know how fucking easy it would be to do up all kinds of fucked up shit?
[224:54.65]No, they're all getting pre-watched, pre-screened.
[224:56.59]Not by me.
[224:57.81]I mean, maybe I will do it.
[224:59.39]It depends on how much there are.
[225:02.31]So there's going to be laws here.
[225:04.56]In this lawless country.
[225:06.46]There's going to be laws.
[225:10.64]Should we put a cap on the amount of videos total?
[225:15.22]I'm not sure because it really depends on how many submissions there are.
[225:19.06]Because if there are, like, let's say 50 to 100 really great submissions, and they're up to two minutes long, I mean, that's not very long.
[225:29.02]You know what I mean?
[225:29.54]Like, that wouldn't take a long time.
[225:30.86]And plus, if we do an entire stream, a full three, four plus hour live stream, maybe two streams, maybe possibly, then they would have to be hundreds of submissions that get through.
[225:42.46]Which, if you take back to the emote contest...
[225:46.01]I mean, the emote contest had a ton of submissions and a ton of ones got pretty screened, but it wasn't like an outrageous level.
[225:53.09]I mean, there's 3000 people here now, but I don't think this channel is quite at a spot where it's unmanageable.
[225:59.69]You know what I mean?
[226:01.35]Up to like three, four, 500 submissions, then going through them and bringing them down to like 100 or 200.
[226:06.60]I mean, if there were like 2000 submissions, then this would be impossible, right?
[226:11.16]What is this contest?
[226:12.20]No, it's not a contest.
[226:13.10]This is not a contest at all.
[226:15.10]This is just a fun thing that we can do just to make some weird shit and see what you guys can come up with.
[226:21.52]Because I also, I was talking to Star about this earlier, it's going to be kind of fun to essentially bring in some people to do them, right?
[226:31.38]Like I'll have, I'll see if Star wants to do an edit.
[226:34.28]He's already talked about it.
[226:35.12]Like Etalyx might want to do an edit.
[226:36.80]Bring in some more people to like do edits and like show theirs on screen.
[226:40.04]You know what I mean?
[226:41.06]Hit up some people, see if they'd want to do it.
[226:46.63]Am I going to be doing a Fortnite?
[226:47.75]No, that was already vetoed.
[226:51.19]So, see if anybody was interested in doing it.
[226:56.13]But... Is that a dong on the door?
[227:00.95]That's a fucking creeper, man.
[227:02.07]Come on, you guys have played that game.
[227:06.04]How am I going to veto the default dance?
[227:07.58]Because I get three vetoes and I don't want to do it.
[227:10.42]And it's actually kind of funny because I didn't do... The veto thing is just there kind of for fun because I vetoed a lot of fucking things that came through there.
[227:18.40]I vetoed almost 90% of every submission.
[227:21.26]So... There's a creeper.
[227:30.82]But it should be fun.
[227:32.46]There'll be way more... What's with the shitty wallpaper?
[227:39.08]It's just like regular wall, man.
[227:44.62]Shitty wall.
[227:45.28]There's no wallpaper on this wall.
[227:49.38]Wallpaper.
[227:52.63]Three vetoes is bullshit?
[227:58.01]Three, hold on.
[227:59.01]Three vetoes based on like 1,500 submissions.
[228:05.96]And I pre-screened them down to like 200.
[228:08.90]Three vetoes out of 200?
[228:11.49]You're lucky I don't veto 50 of them.
[228:16.92]What do you mean, the drink?
[228:17.94]This drink right here.
[228:21.94]Will I pretend to be a rat?
[228:23.16]It depends on if I want to put it in there or not.
[228:26.34]I got a whole list, and it's pretty much ready to go.
[228:29.10]After tonight, I'm going to do one more pass-through tonight and see if there's any new ones or any good ideas, and we'll go from there.
[228:35.73]But what's today?
[228:36.67]Today is... Today is Sunday.
[228:42.47]So I would assume, based around the fact that closing it tonight...
[228:47.51]maybe gonna give myself like three days or so to like well remember I have to buy props on Amazon so at least two days
[228:55.48]I would probably say that by this weekend, like this next weekend coming up here, we'll do it on probably Saturday or Sunday afternoon is what I'm going to shoot for.
[229:04.96]And after that, two weeks later, all the footage will be available, whether you want to pull it from Twitch directly or... It's going to be difficult for me to put it all up raw.
[229:14.71]I'll have to find out if I can do that.
[229:17.31]We'll see.
[229:18.37]But expect it at some point this weekend.
[229:23.17]Is there still a one dance limit?
[229:25.61]Not very many people did dances.
[229:28.01]Not very many people were putting up dances.
[229:29.87]To give you guys a lot of credit here, you guys were trying to at least put some interesting shit up there.
[229:37.36]It wasn't just total nonsense.
[229:39.46]You guys did a pretty good job.
[229:43.65]I'm not going to use more than three vetoes.
[229:45.07]I've already done it.
[229:47.55]You want me to tell you what those three vetoes are?
[229:49.81]Fortnite dance, dab, and reenact the gnome video.
[229:55.26]That's an automatic veto.
[229:58.76]I ain't doing any of those three things.
[230:04.32]Reenact the gnome video was suggested like 6,000 times.
[230:09.03]Then it was upvoted like a thousand times.
[230:11.09]That's a veto.
[230:15.41]Well, let me just give you a little bit of a consolation here.
[230:18.83]Oh no, the gnome is not selectable in the meme poll, but run as Sonic and say Sonic's the name speeds my game.
[230:26.70]That's not fucking embarrassing as hell.
[230:29.44]That's an option.
[230:32.35]Are you kidding me?
[230:35.99]You could be known as the gnome.
[230:37.33]I don't want to be known as the gnome guy.
[230:39.03]I don't want to be known as the guy that's like the annoying dude that I'm the new gnome video that people start to put into the other gnome videos.
[230:46.12]I don't want to be that guy.
[230:47.10]I'll be the guy that people will hate me for that.
[230:50.06]People will be very upset.
[230:51.42]Streamers, YouTubers, friends of yours, people like random people on like Overwatch lobbies.
[230:57.54]People are going to be like, that guy sucks.
[230:59.37]Why did he make this?
[231:00.33]He made that.
[231:01.87]I didn't make it.
[231:02.49]I don't want to make it.
[231:03.23]Veto.
[231:07.11]vetoed man no way but anyways it's gonna be a lot of fun I'm looking forward to it all the props that are there I mean it's gonna be hard but I'll try uh to do a full figure skating skit that's gonna be fucking hard but it's gonna be funny I'm gonna put like fucking fake blades on my shoes there's so many fun things you guys don't think you guys understand
[231:37.45]There's a lot of interesting potential things here.
[231:41.86]Could you say something for a senior quote of mine?
[231:54.77]Falling down hard through the ground eventually you end up standing up because you go through the Earth and you're on top of the world in China.
[232:08.72]So move to China.
[232:24.41]But you just moved to Vegas.
[232:25.89]Well, I'm moving to China now.
[232:27.59]I'm going to China now.
[232:30.25]Take a new balloon.
[232:33.47]Is the sip part of the quote?
[232:34.65]No.
[232:41.86]Help me come up with a wedding toast.
[232:43.02]Okay.
[232:43.18]Hey, everybody.
[232:46.84]Good to see you.
[232:48.17]For those of you on this side that don't know me, I'm Greg.
[232:52.93]Little bro over here, you know.
[232:54.59]I'm the little bro.
[232:56.85]I've seen some of you guys.
[232:57.51]I've met some of you guys.
[232:59.22]And first of all, I got to say,
[233:02.86]Kristen, you've been like a sister to me so far over these last probably 15 years or so.
[233:10.75]I really didn't think that it was ever going to happen because obviously there was all the issues that we had as a family, but we love you.
[233:19.83]You're a sister to us now.
[233:20.87]I just want to say that really quickly before everybody's clapping.
[233:24.08]Everybody's clapping!
[233:27.32]But...
[233:28.64]Dude, man.
[233:29.72]I gotta say something.
[233:30.42]Put my little bro over here.
[233:31.54]Because that's the man of the hour.
[233:33.46]There he is right there.
[233:35.72]Bro.
[233:36.74]No, no.
[233:37.34]This is for the green screen.
[233:39.98]No, this is for the green screen.
[233:42.84]I have to be standing up in a suit for this.
[233:50.43]Save it.
[233:52.05]You have nothing else to do?
[233:53.43]What?
[233:55.61]Can you help with the funeral speech?
[233:59.71]Hey, hey everybody.
[234:02.53]For those of you on this side of the family that don't know, I'm Greg.
[234:07.14]Met some of you guys already here.
[234:09.36]But before we get started, I gotta say, Kristen, it's been a pleasure having you as part of the family.
[234:16.44]And it's just too bad you're down there.
[234:21.09]Down there now.
[234:22.85]But it was an absolute fucking honor
[234:43.05]It's been an honor going down Wedding Wedding slash funeral The move to China as we've all seen You made it right to us you get there I
[235:09.44]Ugh.
[235:10.24]Anyways.
[235:11.56]We talked about the green screen.
[235:13.48]Now, I'm going to move some stuff out of the way, and I'm going to open another game called Red Dead Redemption.
[235:24.39]It's a fun game.
[235:28.05]You can lasso people.
[235:32.61]You can shoot people.
[235:37.15]It's probably the most fun I've ever had in a video game.
[235:47.16]But I don't know, man.
[235:47.70]It seems like it's going to be pretty hard to do.
[235:51.26]With the internet and all.
[235:57.77]What's the matter?
[236:04.07]I don't understand what you guys are talking about.
[236:10.33]Okay, let's go.
[236:12.78]What a bad internet joke.
[236:15.78]I need to put... I actually have to desync it again.
[236:20.79]Because I'm opening up PS4.
[236:23.83]Sorry guys, here comes the desync.
[236:32.81]The door behind me looks mildly shocked.
[236:39.17]The door behind me looks mildly shocked.
[236:42.48]Fuck.
[236:44.46]Fuck.
[236:45.44]Fuck.
[236:46.48]Damn it.
[236:48.22]Damn it.
[236:51.34]Almost puked.
[236:52.48]Alright, let's go.
[236:53.82]Is it even turned on?
[236:54.74]No, it's not.
[237:02.37]Whatever.
[237:04.55]I gotta update the... Hold on, let me get off the camera here, because I don't like how ugly I am.
[237:11.86]By the way, Lethal League...
[237:14.32]It's very good.
[237:15.20]Very fun.
[237:17.06]It's a lot like the first one.
[237:20.12]But the first one was also a ton of fun, so... Doesn't surprise me at all.
[237:26.47]I need to move this.
[237:27.39]That's all good.
[237:28.15]Okay.
[237:36.01]By the way, during the gamer tryhard moment, King Lamb...
[237:42.37]Gave like 10 gifted subs.
[237:44.37]So thank you so much, King Lamb.
[237:49.52]Don't let him spike or even some food.
[238:01.04]Okay, there we go.
