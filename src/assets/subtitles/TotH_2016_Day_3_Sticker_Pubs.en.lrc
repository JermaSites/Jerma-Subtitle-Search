[ve:61.1.100]

[01:03.82]We'll be right back.
[01:11.62]Oh, welcome back.
[01:13.94]We are here and we're starting another pub segment on Tip of the Hats.
[01:18.12]We got a new couch of players we brought.
[01:20.92]Well, not players.
[01:21.70]You guys are players too, but you're dudes.
[01:25.73]We keep bringing in a new couch and it always has new people on it.
[01:28.63]We got Slendini, we got Jermarino, and we got Tagarung.
[01:34.12]Hey.
[01:36.16]Hey.
[01:36.34]What's up?
[01:36.72]How are you doing today, Tag?
[01:38.36]Haven't spoke to you yet.
[01:40.69]Yeah, this is our first meeting.
[01:42.55]First time we've ever met.
[01:44.86]And it's really exciting for me because I've heard so much about you.
[01:48.26]You know, you're way taller than I thought you would be.
[01:50.04]Especially sitting down, yeah.
[01:51.46]I had to, we had to lower this into the floor.
[01:53.79]That old movie trick that we used.
[01:55.53]Just saw off the legs.
[01:56.77]Yeah, yeah.
[01:58.55]They were going to saw off my legs, but then they said the chair might be a little bit easier to do that with.
[02:03.04]So we're going to be doing some more pubbing.
[02:05.76]I believe our friend Nathan Vetterlein joining us again.
[02:08.36]Are you there, Nate?
[02:10.64]Not there yet, perhaps.
[02:12.15]We're going to have him with us, though.
[02:13.85]I'm told.
[02:14.87]Who else we got here in person?
[02:16.16]We have young Wyatt River sitting over there on a comp.
[02:20.40]We've got old Wyatt River.
[02:22.69]No, we've got Raze Fire as well.
[02:24.95]We've got Lang looking real serious.
[02:27.70]And there's a ghost in the fourth chair.
[02:33.09]Okay.
[02:34.21]That's the virus computer.
[02:35.75]That's great.
[02:36.03]We had a Trojan horse earlier that made its way.
[02:38.58]That's the computer that has a bunch of viruses on it.
[02:40.60]Yes.
[02:41.20]We've got Mr. Norton on the way to figure that one out.
[02:45.50]Guys, we've been moving along with donations and whatnot, which is fantastic.
[02:48.89]You can see there are 123,000.
[02:51.95]United States dollars, and we love that we've been rolling along and seeing more donations from you guys.
[02:58.25]Of course, item donations, including unusuals, are open.
[03:01.09]We'll be reading out more of those.
[03:02.55]We've got our challenges, challenges, if you will, on the bottom there.
[03:05.86]We can see we've got about 3K on our pipe launcher jump race.
[03:10.03]We have also, I think we're a little further along.
[03:12.35]We've almost hit our goal for, there we go, 96.28.
[03:14.75]Let's go ahead and get that scout voice actor thing.
[03:17.59]And if you're not familiar with what that means, we had Nathan Vetterlein on yesterday evening, who is the voice actor that has always done the scout voice lines.
[03:26.16]He was just being himself yesterday in the pub.
[03:29.02]Once we hit 10K, though, he's going to be not himself.
[03:31.53]He's going to be the scout from TF2 all throughout the pub, which I think we're all pretty excited for.
[03:37.61]I'm fucking forward to that.
[03:38.31]Yeah.
[03:38.39]So that'll be cool.
[03:39.68]Let's hit that.
[03:40.36]Of course, we've got the speech jammer for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.
[03:44.21]Let's start getting donations rolling for that.
[03:46.33]As we mentioned earlier, we've been using that speech jammer, and it is... My brain hasn't been messed with in quite a while like that.
[03:55.47]Have you tried it, Ted?
[03:56.25]No, yeah, it's...
[03:57.72]You go first.
[03:58.92]It's crazy.
[03:59.30]Which one of you guys is tagged, by the way?
[04:02.81]I don't know why.
[04:03.77]I'm just like, oh, yeah.
[04:05.81]Sorry about that.
[04:06.43]But have you guys all got to try tag?
[04:08.30]Did you?
[04:08.84]No, I haven't.
[04:09.82]I've never even seen the game played.
[04:10.98]I've only heard about it.
[04:11.92]Oh, wow.
[04:12.42]It's messed up.
[04:13.37]It's a messed up effect.
[04:15.03]Because something about like your brain is used to hearing your own voice, but when you're playing it back on a delay in your ears, it messes with you.
[04:23.50]It really messes with you.
[04:24.70]I freeze up.
[04:25.76]I can't do it.
[04:26.38]I freeze up.
[04:26.64]It feels like your brain has basically stopped working completely altogether, which is okay for you guys because you get to experience it and be entertained by it.
[04:35.30]GG.
[04:36.00]Added the GG button.
[04:37.80]Yeah.
[04:38.42]So that's a thing.
[04:40.17]Thank you, by the way, to Justin Bloodsire, Dan, for getting some of those donations right out as we went through the break there.
[04:46.10]We're just trying to call more of you guys out as we go along because we appreciate it.
[04:50.24]It's day three.
[04:51.16]We've been thrilled with how the event is going.
[04:54.15]Jeremy, you're having fun, too.
[04:55.29]I mean, you've got to leave later this afternoon, but you've been doing alright as well.
[04:58.18]Yeah, no, it's been fun.
[04:58.94]I've had a good time.
[05:00.40]I'm glad I was even invited in the first place.
[05:02.44]Thanks, everybody, for letting me be here.
[05:03.95]Yes.
[05:04.91]I'm into it, too.
[05:07.09]So where are we?
[05:07.55]I think we're still getting the pub set up here a little bit.
[05:10.60]I'm going to refresh here and make sure that I'm not repeating donations.
[05:14.25]But we, of course, have the jump section coming up later on as well.
[05:18.89]We've got a $10 donation from A Cup.
[05:21.62]That's a strange name.
[05:23.30]Says, this year has been great, although I want more sentry jumping like last year.
[05:27.94]Good work, guys.
[05:29.45]I don't know if there will be sentry jumping, but I've got to assume there may be.
[05:33.13]And that was pretty gnarly last year, the sentry jumping.
[05:36.13]Like, that was the first time I had seen it was during last year's event.
[05:39.92]There's this glitch you can do where you pick up the sentry gun and you go flying across the map.
[05:45.00]Right.
[05:46.20]Rescue Ranger.
[05:47.08]Yeah, I had never seen that up to that point.
[05:49.66]And, I mean, it was something else.
[05:52.57]We've got another one here, $30 from Johnis01.
[05:55.50]First year watching Tip of the Hats.
[05:57.26]You guys seem to be doing a great job.
[05:58.72]So here is $30 to help them kids with cancer.
[06:01.67]I look forward to watching more Tip of the Hats next year.
[06:04.72]I look forward to more too we had what I I saw Jeff leaving Jeff infusino of course the president of uh child uh what is it children's oncology services inc was here and I said Jeff I'll see you next year my man I didn't say my man but it was implied implied it was implied with my yeah with the face yeah my man so was that a uh venti or grande
[06:25.90]He's got to get his morning cup of Joe's.
[06:27.16]He's just drinking coffee.
[06:28.22]I'm just drinking coffee.
[06:29.63]Is that what they call a venti?
[06:31.53]No.
[06:32.65]We got that from out in the other room.
[06:34.92]They brought the coffee in and that's all it is.
[06:36.95]It has a Starbucks.
[06:39.05]I wanted the small and
[06:41.15]He's using a Starbucks cup, but it's not from Starbucks.
[06:43.63]It's from out in the other room.
[06:46.36]I think this is what they call a triple large.
[06:48.12]Maybe that's where the confusion is coming from.
[06:49.78]I think they call it triple triple shot.
[06:51.49]Is that a triple shot espresso?
[06:52.75]I can understand your confusion, definitely.
[06:55.89]Absolutely.
[06:56.76]Absolutely.
[06:58.14]Absolutely.
[06:59.88]Let me get an update here.
[07:00.64]I got a feeling that we might have hit the... How's it taste?
[07:03.81]Pretty good.
[07:04.17]We didn't get the sound yet, but I feel like we might be pennies away from the Nathan Vetterlein scout.
[07:12.14]Are you there with us yet, Nathan?
[07:13.70]I was under the understanding that he'd be with us here at this pub.
[07:16.28]Hello?
[07:18.01]Not here.
[07:19.11]He'll bust in and say hello.
[07:21.03]Kool-Aid man, we call him.
[07:23.17]the audio version of Kool-Aid Man.
[07:25.09]He's gonna bust in through the back here.
[07:26.35]Gonna make the sound with his mouth.
[07:28.39]Smash.
[07:30.00]Oh, yeah.
[07:32.52]So, let's see.
[07:33.10]We've got a donation here from... Oh, sorry.
[07:36.30]I gotta hit refresh here on this.
[07:37.87]That was Fender McBender.
[07:39.47]$333.33.
[07:40.21]Says, howdy, howdy.
[07:44.27]I'm back.
[07:45.02]I think this should make the Scout incentive happen.
[07:47.08]Boom.
[07:47.68]He did it.
[07:48.04]Your pal, Fender McBender.
[07:49.50]Now, that's a good one.
[07:50.74]It's a good donation.
[07:51.84]Why don't we stick some stickers on him?
[07:54.51]Every donation you raise.
[07:55.59]Oh, yeah, sure.
[07:56.21]Let's put some stickers on Slim.
[07:58.41]Do you have stickers?
[07:59.83]I'm a magician.
[08:02.39]You didn't know that?
[08:03.63]Both of you guys maybe didn't know.
[08:04.72]I'll probably show you a quick little magic trick.
[08:06.78]We're looking for some stickers.
[08:08.22]You can see nothing in my hands.
[08:10.18]Nothing in the hands.
[08:11.30]See?
[08:11.80]There's nothing in these hands.
[08:13.28]As you can see here.
[08:14.36]Take a look at that.
[08:15.34]Nothing in the hands.
[08:16.09]I see it.
[08:16.63]Nothing in the hands.
[08:17.47]Whoa, what's that?
[08:19.05]Oof.
[08:19.55]Wow.
[08:20.15]What's that?
[08:20.71]It's gone.
[08:21.17]Nothing in the hands.
[08:22.09]Whoa.
[08:22.87]Yeah.
[08:23.23]Nothing up my sleeve.
[08:24.10]Nothing up these sleeves.
[08:24.88]We got this.
[08:25.56]Presto.
[08:26.04]Presto Magesto.
[08:27.98]What?
[08:28.72]What?
[08:29.49]Yeah.
[08:29.69]I bet you didn't know I was a magician.
[08:31.75]What?
[08:32.83]We got stickers here.
[08:33.65]Let's put some on you.
[08:34.39]What?
[08:35.22]Jerma is the 10th class.
[08:36.28]Guys, can we get some?
[08:37.84]My heart's one-step camp stickers.
[08:42.03]They're like stuck together with something.
[08:45.41]Sticky stickers.
[08:46.15]Probably some adhesive.
[08:48.62]Speaking of adhesive, we've got Nathan.
[08:50.38]Hello?
[08:51.68]Yeah, I'm back.
[08:52.58]Yeah, Nathan.
[08:53.68]Now, you were talking a lot about adhesive before, right?
[08:57.97]Yeah.
[08:58.51]Yeah, of course.
[08:59.95]Adhesives.
[09:00.70]We're putting stickers on Mr. Slin, Nathan.
[09:02.84]Have you ever done that?
[09:04.39]I've put stickers on Slynn before, yeah.
[09:05.97]Of course, yeah.
[09:06.89]Last night.
[09:08.07]We've all done that.
[09:08.83]We've all done it once.
[09:09.63]Every night.
[09:10.58]So, Nathan, welcome back to the pub.
[09:13.34]And we're still seeing here this, you know, sort of famous legendary Rick Flame thing happening still in this pub.
[09:21.93]What are your feelings on that?
[09:24.32]I felt like I couldn't let it die.
[09:27.40]Yep.
[09:28.04]It was important to me.
[09:30.21]Yeah.
[09:30.59]I know it's important to Rick most of all.
[09:32.67]I don't want to let him down.
[09:34.68]We were trying to get him on the phone this morning, but boy, he was out partying last night.
[09:38.52]Such a boost for his career.
[09:40.56]It wasn't just you.
[09:41.66]When we got on today, half of the Steam names that were on there, they were all doing the same kind of thing.
[09:49.09]I saw if you Google his name now or something like that, it shows up.
[09:52.97]Really?
[09:53.67]Let's go.
[09:53.87]Challenge accepted.
[09:54.83]Guess what, Nate?
[09:55.59]It looks like the Scout's going to be joining us later on at 4 o'clock Central Time.
[10:00.58]Doing that pub section.
[10:04.38]We're pumped up.
[10:05.00]We're fired up for that one.
[10:07.16]Freaking awesome, actually.
[10:08.54]You know, I was thinking about this.
[10:13.77]I'm kind of new to the whole tip of the hats thing still.
[10:16.49]This is my first time here, and I'm having a really good time, but I was just thinking about how big this number is for a game that people are worried is dying.
[10:25.10]I don't know.
[10:27.10]This is pretty cool, the amount of support and the amount of people who are tuning out to be involved and support this.
[10:33.80]I don't know.
[10:34.14]I thought this was a pretty... I just wanted to mention that.
[10:36.29]This is pretty cool.
[10:37.15]Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[10:39.23]People are definitely into it.
[10:40.97]A lot of the donation comments that have come in, they've kind of made allusions to that, you know what I mean?
[10:46.18]Saying, geez, for a dead game, this is pretty good.
[10:48.77]We've got almost $125,000 in three days.
[10:53.09]And I don't know, it really sort of legitimizes it.
[10:55.40]People get these ideas in their heads of what a video gamer is or what games are.
[11:00.44]And I don't know, I think this is a really great example that it's...
[11:04.25]It's 2016.
[11:04.75]This isn't the stereotype anymore of the random nerd in the basement.
[11:09.05]I mean, we had a lot of great people here who have come together, and we're doing real, very tangible things, and it's pretty wild.
[11:16.02]That's awesome.
[11:16.78]Pretty cool.
[11:17.44]Yep.
[11:17.88]Pretty good.
[11:18.30]It is pretty cool.
[11:20.03]Yeah.
[11:20.49]So, Slynn getting some of the stickers.
[11:24.43]So, we got three stickers on Slynn so far.
[11:27.65]So, what's the criteria, Jerma, for getting stickers on there?
[11:30.64]Like, what are you looking for specifically?
[11:32.70]Oh, looking for good spots, you know, maybe on the chest area.
[11:36.71]Maybe a couple on the arms.
[11:38.13]Now, if there's one thing we know about Slynn, he's got a big chest.
[11:41.66]You're working out.
[11:42.64]Really?
[11:43.28]Yeah.
[11:44.32]Boy, oh boy.
[11:44.98]Give us a flex there, Slynn.
[11:46.59]Three push-ups in a row.
[11:47.73]Show us your biggest muscles there.
[11:50.47]Well, my biggest muscle's on my butt, but I... Okay.
[11:53.07]Butt muscles.
[11:53.95]Butt muscles.
[11:54.58]Well... So can you put stickers on there?
[11:56.10]The glutes.
[11:57.34]Can we get some stickers back there?
[11:58.72]Can we get some stickers on here?
[11:59.46]Is that statistically... Is that right, scientifically?
[12:01.45]Glutes?
[12:02.05]Yeah, the largest muscles on my body?
[12:03.61]Yes?
[12:03.95]Yeah.
[12:04.59]Okay, confirmation.
[12:05.53]Isn't the longest muscle... Confirmed.
[12:07.31]No, the strongest muscle in your body per square inch is the tongue.
[12:13.70]The largest organ is your skin.
[12:18.35]The second largest muscle, Rick Flame.
[12:25.08]Everybody's body?
[12:27.02]Do we all have a Rick Flame in us?
[12:30.71]I think we might.
[12:31.25]I think there's a little bit of Rick Flame inside each and every one of us.
[12:34.77]Different sizes.
[12:36.24]We're just going to keep this going.
[12:37.58]Several parts per million.
[12:39.58]I'm excited to do the same joke for two days.
[12:42.11]It'll be great.
[12:43.77]Who watches Tekken?
[12:45.07]Who cares?
[12:47.14]We got an anonymous $100 donation.
[12:50.08]Speaking of jokes we've been doing for two days, Anonymous has been going huge with his donations.
[12:55.83]Anonymous.
[12:56.93]So here's the Raise Mom donation.
[12:58.80]This is from, and it does seem to be, the information seems to line up.
[13:04.51]She says, so thankful for all the help you're providing for the kids.
[13:08.36]So thankful that Raise Fire is a part of this.
[13:11.02]And thankful that we as his family were fortunate that he grew up strong and healthy.
[13:16.03]Aww.
[13:16.53]And I love TF2.
[13:18.41]This community's been so good to raise all through his growing up years.
[13:22.26]Blessings to you all.
[13:24.50]Is Ian our big healthy boy who we're very proud of?
[13:27.25]Can we get the tissues on the couch?
[13:30.99]My mom is pretty great.
[13:32.09]I'm not even going to sugarcoat it.
[13:34.75]She's a good mom.
[13:35.84]You know what?
[13:36.62]I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
[13:37.66]My mom is lovely.
[13:38.98]I'm sorry to be so upfront.
[13:40.88]I'm trying to brag.
[13:42.70]I don't want to brag, but I got a great mom.
[13:44.75]My mom's crate.
[13:46.60]Crate.
[13:47.70]Thanks, Mom.
[13:48.51]Thanks, Mom.
[13:50.33]Now, guys, we actually have something very special right now.
[13:54.32]In addition to, we just mentioned, we've got Nathan, of course, in the server with us.
[13:59.23]We have, for the first time on any of these events, a camper who has attended One Step Camp with us in Discord, in voice right now.
[14:08.97]Hello, are you there?
[14:10.49]Hey.
[14:11.21]Hey, so who is this?
[14:12.81]Can you introduce yourself?
[14:14.33]My name's Jacob.
[14:15.59]I've been going to camp now for like, I don't know, it's been like 10 years.
[14:20.97]And I've always like heard of Tip of the Hats.
[14:23.82]I've watched, but I've never like, this is really cool to participate.
[14:29.53]Yeah, well, I mean, we're glad that you're able to come here and participate.
[14:32.48]We're glad that we can have you in.
[14:34.42]You know, in past years, we've had kind of more and more interaction with, for example, last year, a bunch of the campers signed a framed poster or something like that for us, which is really cool.
[14:47.58]We see a lot of photos and stuff like that, but it's really cool right now to have you here.
[14:53.21]So 10 years...
[14:54.73]I mean, that's pretty staggering.
[14:56.73]And that kind of, I think, reminds me of how everyone kind of says it's a family.
[15:00.70]And it's like once you go to camp, you don't want to stop going to camp.
[15:04.27]And a lot of people become counselors and stuff like that.
[15:07.25]Is it a, I mean, I got to think you probably agree with that.
[15:10.64]Is it like a family?
[15:12.14]Oh my gosh, yes.
[15:14.15]There's one day that goes by where I don't think about somebody from the camp or just think about going back.
[15:20.50]I just would give anything to be there right now.
[15:24.26]Wow.
[15:25.17]Is that you, Jacob, in the pub?
[15:27.27]We got us into the server with the...
[15:29.79]Oh, yeah.
[15:31.02]Nice.
[15:31.64]Alright.
[15:32.38]That's cool.
[15:32.84]So not only is he here, he's getting to play.
[15:35.21]So are you a TF2 person?
[15:36.69]Is this a game you played on your own before you heard of Tip of the Hats?
[15:41.04]I used to play a lot of TF2, and I've transitioned more over into playing a lot of Dota now.
[15:46.19]Sure.
[15:47.26]But TF2 was one of the very first games that I... It's what I started out with, basically.
[15:52.62]Yeah, same old story.
[15:53.91]Same for a lot of us as well.
[15:56.23]A lot of people really started with TF2, right?
[15:58.51]That's how they started all their games.
[16:00.47]Yeah, it's awesome.
[16:01.22]Absolutely.
[16:02.18]So, yeah, no, we're thrilled here, and we've been finding out more and more about the camp.
[16:07.82]There's Jacob.
[16:08.50]There he is.
[16:09.67]And we just hit $125,000 for one-step camp.
[16:15.68]So we got the man himself here now with his Persian Persuader.
[16:18.46]We don't need to put the pressure on, you know.
[16:19.96]We'll let you do your thing, but the cameras.
[16:23.13]You're going to get a 12K, right?
[16:24.53]Yeah, here we go.
[16:25.39]Oh, boy.
[16:25.93]So were you much into the community?
[16:29.64]I mean, do you know much about these YouTubers and these people that we have here?
[16:33.16]It's pretty cool how we've brought a lot of these folks together.
[16:35.77]Do you know like Jerma or Tag or any of those guys?
[16:38.91]I'm not too familiar now.
[16:40.74]No?
[16:41.20]Okay.
[16:41.54]Not everyone is.
[16:42.10]You know what?
[16:43.15]I didn't know about YouTube until I started getting into going to the websites and on Reddit and stuff like that.
[16:48.54]I wasn't a huge YouTube person.
[16:51.84]We're sticking stickers on Mr. Slinn.
[16:53.80]We're still sticking on him.
[16:54.76]If you ever hear Mr. Slinn, you think stickers.
[16:57.07]That would be an easy way to remember him.
[16:59.63]The Slinn sticker.
[17:00.71]We just had a secret conversation.
[17:01.83]We had a little secret conversation.
[17:03.10]We're talking about the cups.
[17:04.30]The cups.
[17:05.22]So, Jacob.
[17:06.96]Just a secret.
[17:07.80]Only to these two.
[17:08.64]So, you go to the camps.
[17:10.19]We talked about how there are camps all year round.
[17:14.19]Do you know when the next time you'll be able to go to one of the camps is right now?
[17:18.52]I'll probably be able to go around wintertime coming up because, well, there's another program coming up that's like a horse riding program.
[17:27.17]I'd love to go to that, but I have pressures of school.
[17:31.79]But the next time, that winter camp, it's amazing.
[17:35.96]Like years past, we go skiing, snowboarding and stuff.
[17:39.74]So what would you say is your favorite program or favorite activity at the camps?
[17:45.05]okay so this is really cool so one time a year we get to go to like this is for like this is like the older kid group we get to go to like North Carolina and go like whitewater rafting we get to do like rock climbing and we get to camp out for like an entire week and it's just I would never be able to do anything like that without camp like at all
[18:07.63]Whitewater rafting, that sounds awesome.
[18:09.55]Yeah, that sounds better than my life.
[18:12.25]I want to go whitewater rafting too.
[18:14.17]That sounds awesome.
[18:14.92]Cooler than anything I've ever done in mine.
[18:16.86]Yeah.
[18:17.44]No, I mean, that's really cool.
[18:19.24]Guys, if you're just tuning in, we've got Jacob here.
[18:22.18]He switched over.
[18:22.79]He's using the original.
[18:23.69]Look at that.
[18:24.49]Jacob is a camper who's been going to One Step Camp for about 10 years, he said.
[18:29.17]First time that we've been able to interact right here on the stream with someone that's been there.
[18:33.22]They've been in that.
[18:34.58]I think we're all kind of like...
[18:36.14]butterflies in our stomach like it's really cool for us to chat to you uh uh Jacob I'm glad we could get you in here so um so we can see here we got you in the pub uh I mean I'm hoping that we'll be able to get you in future years and possibly some other people I know there's talk of uh getting people here in person maybe in future years which would be really cool as well maybe we'll have to get you here are you are you camera shy at all
[19:00.95]Oh, not at all.
[19:02.15]Not at all.
[19:03.71]Awesome.
[19:03.89]It's probably why we got you.
[19:05.33]You sound like you're a cool dude, just kind of wide open like us.
[19:09.40]Not afraid at all.
[19:10.58]I love my video games, too.
[19:12.36]Yeah.
[19:13.98]Wow.
[19:14.40]Well, that's fantastic.
[19:15.98]And I've got to imagine, I mean, there's probably a lot of people that... Are there people that go to the camp that live near you that you sort of get to interact with more in person, or do you live kind of more out of the way?
[19:29.42]See, there are...
[19:30.80]A big general majority of the people are from like the Midwest.
[19:35.31]So we're all like within, I would say like an hour away from people.
[19:39.28]Oh, wow.
[19:39.72]And I do meet up with some of my friends because they, I mean, like one of my friends from camp only lives 30 minutes away from me.
[19:49.92]That's awesome.
[19:50.82]That's really close.
[19:52.17]Yeah.
[19:52.79]So, I mean, if it's cool with you, Jacob, I mean, let's find out more.
[19:57.22]So, now, how old are you now, Jacob?
[19:59.78]I am 16.
[20:00.30]16.
[20:00.68]So, I mean, that's still hecka young.
[20:03.29]Now, you're obviously a survivor of cancer.
[20:07.71]Can we ask you, how young were you when you were first diagnosed?
[20:10.88]I was six years old.
[20:12.49]Six.
[20:13.19]Wow.
[20:13.59]Wow.
[20:14.23]Amazing.
[20:14.89]That's incredible.
[20:15.63]So, you know, so did you go through, I can ask you, how long were you going through treatment and whatnot?
[20:22.03]Like how long was it before you were sort of past it?
[20:25.11]Yeah, yeah.
[20:25.67]Okay, so I was diagnosed in 2006 with ALL leukemia, and I was on treatment up right into August of 09, so.
[20:38.10]Yeah, that's an ordeal.
[20:39.42]So now, were you able to attend camp during treatment, as I know a lot of kids are able to?
[20:45.69]Yes.
[20:46.37]Yeah, that was actually one of the things I think that helped me out the most because I had never gotten the opportunity to be around like other kids like me who were going through the same thing.
[20:56.87]And it was just the first time where I felt like I was normal, like I was where I was supposed to be for like the longest time.
[21:07.39]Yeah, I mean, that's pretty amazing.
[21:10.60]That's awesome to hear.
[21:11.32]I know a lot of the campers end up wanting to be like, what do we call it?
[21:14.92]Working there.
[21:15.70]Yeah, working there.
[21:16.43]Working for counselors.
[21:17.81]Do you see yourself doing that eventually, Jacob?
[21:21.23]Oh, my goodness.
[21:22.51]Every day I think about leading a program or just it's part of my life, and I'll never stop talking about it.
[21:31.32]Fantastic.
[21:33.31]Speaking sort of on that same topic, we have an item donation here by Vasco Leprechaun, donating an item, an unusual.
[21:41.79]Says, my first unusual for the cause.
[21:44.19]Cancer has been the source of a lot of pain in my family, but we've worked through it together.
[21:48.94]the importance of community for those going through cancer and for cancer survivors cannot be understated thanks so much for giving us the opportunity to donate items to this awesome cause and I think we all kind of feel that uh any stories Jacob from from camp I mean is there anything entertaining that you could tell us I mean you've been going for so long I mean you must have dozens of uh memorable things anything you can think of right now we gotta get a camp
[22:13.43]Yeah Tell them about the time that we went camping and it rained So this was like was this two years ago and It was the first week and in camp craft, which is our camping program that that's my favorite guys So we were we were on the Wisconsin River and
[22:40.66]And we set up for the night.
[22:42.72]Everything was good.
[22:45.03]We were like, oh, it's probably not going to rain.
[22:47.75]Everything's fine.
[22:48.91]And we saw a little bit of lightning, just a little bit.
[22:53.14]And all the campers went to bed.
[22:56.16]And I just remember waking up, and I felt water hitting me in the face.
[23:01.99]And then somebody said, should we do something about this?
[23:04.73]Because our tent was leaking.
[23:06.33]And then it fell over.
[23:07.89]And when I got out of the tent,
[23:10.94]There was torrential rain, wind, lightning, and it was pretty crazy.
[23:19.16]And I remember looking across this beach that we were on and seeing the girls' tent fall over that we were trying to go to.
[23:26.87]Oh, no.
[23:29.50]And we see all the counselors huddled underneath the tarp on the beach to the right of us.
[23:37.73]and we just booked it to their tents and we spent the rest of the night in the dry counselor tents.
[23:45.06]And Jacob, what did the counselors do?
[23:47.34]You guys stayed outside all night, and somebody even got burned by the fire.
[23:52.98]Yes, we were so cold that we were very close to the fire, and someone ended up with first-degree burns on her legs because she was so cold and she was standing so close to the fire.
[24:01.95]Now, who was that?
[24:02.61]That person's not here with us today.
[24:04.34]No, she's not.
[24:05.00]It was not me.
[24:05.68]Thank goodness.
[24:06.70]But I remember that all of the kids were soaking wet, just absolutely drenched.
[24:11.87]And even though it was summer, it was freezing cold outside because it was like a very cold rain.
[24:17.27]And so these kids are cold.
[24:18.89]We're like, these kids are going to become hypothermic.
[24:20.72]What do we do?
[24:21.78]So we, the counselors, got out our dry clothes from our tents that were much shorter and didn't collapse.
[24:29.93]And I outfitted a bunch of the boys in my cute little tank tops.
[24:33.92]I think I have pictures of that somewhere.
[24:36.16]And we threw them in our dry tents, soaking wet children.
[24:40.85]We let you guys sleep in there for the night and the counselors stayed awake by the fire because there was no way we're going to be able to sleep and in the morning we got up and continued our canoe trip and finished it that day one day early because It was very cold and we were very wet I was wearing a sriracha shirt and nice and then
[25:02.01]Some shorts from somebody who I never know who gave them to me.
[25:07.08]That's because we care about you kids.
[25:09.88]Well, I think one cool thing about raising over $125,000, maybe next year we'll get a meteorologist for the campers.
[25:18.96]Let you guys know if you're going to get drenched.
[25:22.09]That's a pretty good story.
[25:23.19]I don't know.
[25:24.03]Yeah, I can't top that one.
[25:26.37]That's a pretty good camp story.
[25:27.84]But there's so many more.
[25:29.14]Yeah.
[25:29.80]No, I mean, we can imagine.
[25:31.02]We talk all about how – and we hear stories from Jeff and from Colleen, Lauren, of course, even Lang, who has worked doing photography at the camp of –
[25:41.93]how it's just so memorable.
[25:43.72]It's just so many memorable experiences and just that crazy awesome energy.
[25:49.79]And it's, I don't know, I mean, it's cool to be able to kind of put a voice to it and sort of, I guess, put some humanity to it and hear it from Jacob.
[25:59.48]Jacob here with 9 HP.
[26:01.00]Now, you can't push with 9 HP, Jacob.
[26:02.51]We all know that.
[26:03.51]I'll heal you.
[26:04.75]I'll heal you.
[26:05.43]Lauren's coming over to heal you, just like real life.
[26:07.59]Repping the score shot.
[26:09.60]Yeah.
[26:10.44]There it goes.
[26:11.58]I'm here.
[26:13.15]I'm here.
[26:13.35]We're good.
[26:13.70]He's not excited.
[26:14.46]We're on a mission.
[26:17.88]We had a donation of an Australian rocket launcher from Fishy.
[26:21.56]That's $99 in value.
[26:24.29]Saying, I had the launcher for like two years now, but ever since I switched to the original, it's just been rotting.
[26:30.42]The kids can have it.
[26:31.50]Best use of it.
[26:33.36]And wants us to get the incentive rolling on the pipe launcher race coming up later in the jump section.
[26:38.27]Thank you for giving us your rotting Australian rocket launcher.
[26:42.40]But if people are just tuning in, if you've missed Friday and Saturday, you can donate many items in-game.
[26:48.37]Keys, australiums, tickets, and even unusuals.
[26:51.87]They'll get converted to cash in a snap.
[26:53.65]It makes a funny noise when you do it.
[26:55.20]We did that one yesterday.
[26:56.40]And yeah, it goes directly to One Step Camp, of course.
[27:01.47]Another one here, 10 keys worth of a donation from Ribbon, saying greetings from Vietnam.
[27:06.39]Boy, oh boy.
[27:07.13]I hope everyone's having a great time.
[27:08.48]It's 1 a.m.
[27:09.26]in Vietnam, but I don't mind staying up to watch Tip of the Hats.
[27:12.12]It's my third year watching, but first time I donated.
[27:15.11]Here's my 10 bucks.
[27:16.23]It is for the kids, and that's pretty cool.
[27:18.56]There you go.
[27:19.20]Vietnam checking in.
[27:20.92]People watching from all over the world.
[27:23.85]It's pretty wild.
[27:27.43]How's the pub here going?
[27:28.73]We've got Jacob back on demo.
[27:31.08]Do you have a main class in the game, Jacob?
[27:32.96]Or do you have a favorite class that you like to do?
[27:36.20]Demoman is my favorite.
[27:38.37]Always be.
[27:39.91]I got you.
[27:42.47]There's the highlight reel.
[27:44.19]Get your cameras ready.
[27:46.06]Here it is.
[27:48.92]Up against that overhealed Demo.
[27:51.70]Oh, look at that.
[27:52.68]Charge and charge.
[27:53.31]He's still going.
[27:54.43]Jacob is a god.
[27:57.77]That's cool.
[27:58.92]I mean, hopefully, you know, Tip of the Hats can be cool enough that you'll want to keep coming back to Tip of the Hats every year.
[28:04.06]Maybe not as cool as camp.
[28:06.07]But we're trying.
[28:07.09]Maybe close.
[28:07.89]Yeah, exactly.
[28:10.02]We don't have whitewater rafts.
[28:11.04]We don't have whitewater rafting here, yeah.
[28:13.20]But it's still cool.
[28:14.16]You have camp, but do you have a Steve covering stickers?
[28:17.19]I don't know if you got that over there.
[28:18.91]No, I actually didn't realize how many donations we were getting.
[28:21.05]Because, you know, you kind of watch in the stream.
[28:22.83]Yeah, you can see them now.
[28:23.79]You can see the number going up.
[28:24.54]But now you get, like, yeah, you get all these stickers.
[28:26.20]Now you kind of know.
[28:26.88]I kind of have a little bit of real estate issue over here on the shoulder.
[28:30.02]But we'll work down over here on the tummy and through it.
[28:32.95]We'll do some tummies.
[28:34.61]Two of my favorite YouTubers slash streamers sitting next to each other on my favorite annual charity stream.
[28:41.10]Now, who do we think it is?
[28:43.30]Definitely Tag and Gemma.
[28:44.40]I don't know.
[28:45.00]Maybe it's Tag and Get Oil.
[28:46.65]Yeah.
[28:46.97]Yeah, Tag and Gemma.
[28:47.65]I'm not going to say.
[28:48.65]We appreciate people naming names, but we don't like to name names because then people get excluded.
[28:53.46]I don't know.
[28:53.78]Slim is a streamer.
[28:56.13]Slim does some great.
[28:57.05]And a YouTuber.
[28:58.21]Yeah.
[28:58.29]Anyway, that was a donation of 20 bucks from the Frazz Boy.
[29:02.14]Says, take my money.
[29:03.48]Hi from Scotland.
[29:04.91]That's pretty cool.
[29:05.57]There you go.
[29:06.15]Scotland.
[29:07.55]Scotland.
[29:08.10]Scotland.
[29:08.46]Scotland.
[29:09.38]You fancy yourself a label kilo, do you?
[29:14.69]Yep.
[29:15.35]A label?
[29:17.72]Yeah, it's a beer thing.
[29:19.48]We're not allowed to talk about it.
[29:20.58]No, yeah.
[29:21.44]It was an old commercial.
[29:22.30]I think it was for Alexander Keats.
[29:24.10]And there was a man peeling the label off his beer bottle.
[29:26.91]And then the Scottish man said, you fancy yourself a label?
[29:30.29]You know a lot of commercials.
[29:31.45]Yeah, I do.
[29:32.26]Pop culture.
[29:33.02]I'm a TV kid.
[29:33.50]Jacob, do you know about that?
[29:34.56]TVA.
[29:34.86]Do you know about that commercial?
[29:36.10]Do you know about this?
[29:37.84]No, I do not.
[29:38.50]So what's the story of the pup here, Jacob?
[29:42.74]Are you guys winning, losing?
[29:43.99]Do we have a stalemate going on here?
[29:45.65]Are you a cart pusher?
[29:47.62]I'm more of a just kind of go person.
[29:52.93]I like it.
[29:54.57]You're like me.
[29:55.11]You're impatient.
[29:55.93]You can't wait for stuff to happen.
[29:57.38]You got to just go in and make it happen yourself.
[29:59.30]Use the chaos element.
[30:00.78]Go, go, go.
[30:01.85]Nobody pushes the car anyway.
[30:02.97]That's overrated.
[30:04.33]Don't worry about that.
[30:05.75]Never stop.
[30:07.32]Never stop.
[30:08.78]There's a respawn timer for a reason, man.
[30:11.14]Yeah, that's true.
[30:12.04]Well, you got to make the most of it.
[30:13.28]Get in there and, you know, make things happen.
[30:15.99]There's Jacob getting blasted.
[30:18.03]Now air blast.
[30:18.77]There's a... Oh, no.
[30:21.21]Almost saved it with the charge.
[30:22.20]I thought he was going to be my friend.
[30:24.08]Almost.
[30:24.86]That was really close.
[30:25.88]Something to be said for air blast.
[30:28.52]Pyro's getting an update.
[30:29.62]Can't be soon enough, I don't think.
[30:33.85]You still with us, Nathan?
[30:35.29]What's your perspective here on this pub, my man?
[30:38.93]He's winning.
[30:39.51]So, I'm winning, and I also have... I have a confession.
[30:44.04]Yep.
[30:45.68]I killed Jacob.
[30:46.63]You killed Jacob.
[30:48.33]No!
[30:48.41]Now, Jacob, what do you think of that?
[30:49.33]You've got the Scout voice actor killing you in the game.
[30:51.97]Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[30:54.14]A little bit of both.
[30:55.40]A little bit of both.
[30:56.48]Mixed feelings.
[30:58.34]Oh, he's going for the taunt kill while ubered.
[31:00.18]That would have been cool.
[31:01.58]That would have been a classic.
[31:03.27]There are competitive players that try that, I'm told.
[31:05.43]Hey, Wyatt.
[31:06.67]The taunt kill while ubered.
[31:08.59]Classic.
[31:10.64]Oh, there he goes.
[31:11.84]But, yeah, so you're winning, but upward.
[31:15.00]I mean, does it get a whole lot better than upward in terms of a pub map?
[31:18.21]Are we feeling it today, gamers?
[31:19.69]Nathan, are we doing alright?
[31:23.15]I would say yes.
[31:26.00]Mm-hmm.
[31:26.72]And then I will say that.
[31:27.84]Yes.
[31:28.27]Yes.
[31:29.31]Okay.
[31:29.43]I would say yes.
[31:30.81]Let's say it again.
[31:32.39]Yes.
[31:33.31]Yeah.
[31:34.77]Yeah.
[31:35.73]Doing it here.
[31:36.53]Oh, there's a heavy just waiting.
[31:38.04]Now, who is this heavy?
[31:39.90]Is that a friend of yours?
[31:41.56]Oh, boy.
[31:42.72]Mayla, come on up.
[31:44.02]That was a real flame.
[31:45.40]What is this face on that side?
[31:47.09]Raytastic.
[31:47.71]Yeah, what is that?
[31:48.69]I think that is Jontron.
[31:50.21]I think that's... It is Jontron.
[31:51.55]It looked like a young, fresh-faced Lang until I looked closer.
[31:55.20]Jontron's here?
[31:56.36]He's right there.
[31:57.46]Well, he's on his side.
[31:58.72]What?
[31:59.12]V. John Trump.
[32:02.38]Rick Flame is here.
[32:03.36]Yeah, Rick.
[32:04.27]Boy, oh boy.
[32:05.53]Couldn't get Rick in Discord.
[32:06.67]I saw there's also John Inferno.
[32:08.63]Oh, yeah.
[32:09.37]John Inferno, his counterpart.
[32:11.67]His evil twin.
[32:13.36]The antithesis of Rick Flame.
[32:16.64]Rick Flame from Earth 2.0.
[32:18.50]Alright.
[32:19.68]Do you think by the end of this, you will have a sticker shirt on?
[32:22.87]That would be kind of cool.
[32:23.95]Sticker shirt.
[32:25.27]If we actually got to that point, it would be pretty impressive.
[32:27.10]That would be very impressive.
[32:28.30]Let's get more.
[32:28.94]And, guys, keep the donations coming in.
[32:30.46]I mean, we're having fun here, but we're coming up on $126,000.
[32:33.45]We still have those incentives.
[32:35.67]If you're donating, don't forget to set those.
[32:38.72]$20 from Backscratch saying third and sadly last donation.
[32:43.47]Sad.
[32:44.23]with a tear coming down.
[32:47.31]Hearing how much fun Jacob has had at the camp and all his stories really makes me happy to help as much as I can.
[32:53.02]Great to hear how much it helps.
[32:55.20]Again, great work with all the people working in front and behind the camera.
[32:58.97]Shout out to everyone for the kids.
[33:01.99]You tried, Rick.
[33:04.72]I mean, I think it's so cool for us.
[33:06.60]I mean, you know, Jacob, we're here and like you said, I think you've seen some footage of the event.
[33:12.17]I mean, we goof around, we eat bananas, we do wacky stuff, but we always keep coming back and reminding ourselves that this is a very real thing and that, you know, we found out last year sort of how much money it takes to send somebody to one of the camps.
[33:25.79]It's roughly around $2,000.
[33:27.90]I don't know if that's still correct.
[33:29.36]Yeah.
[33:29.44]It's about $1,000 per kid per week.
[33:32.80]So, like, to go to the full two weeks of the summer camp per camper is about $2,000.
[33:36.95]Yeah.
[33:37.25]So, I mean, it's really cool for us.
[33:39.73]And, I mean, I don't know.
[33:40.69]I don't know if it's, like, hitting us all yet, but it will.
[33:43.60]We're sending a lot of kids.
[33:44.42]It's a very real thing.
[33:46.00]And you guys watching, your donations are literally, it's as easy as this.
[33:50.73]They're helping send guys like Jacob and girls as well, of course.
[33:55.29]I mean, to say guys, but sending kids to camp.
[33:58.62]to feel normal, as Jacob put it.
[34:01.70]I mean, you can't understate that one enough, I don't think.
[34:08.24]Bye-bye.
[34:08.92]Wow, jeez.
[34:09.71]You got distracted there, Jake.
[34:11.05]Never stop.
[34:11.81]He was trying to go to camp himself, but in the game, charging right off.
[34:16.59]Speaking of Rick Flame, he added me on Steam, and he just sent me a message and said, how do I get in?
[34:22.28]So he's trying to get in.
[34:23.58]We're bringing him back.
[34:26.46]We like the joke.
[34:27.22]We don't like it that much, though.
[34:28.60]I'm trying to give everyone a turn, my man.
[34:32.09]You'll get in there.
[34:32.69]You've got to be patient.
[34:33.51]Same thing for everybody.
[34:35.35]We had, let's see, a $250 donation.
[34:39.56]Don't know if this one was read already or not by Shun, who is giving 125k hype, saying Toth is a celebration of the personalities and charity of the TF2 community.
[34:50.00]Thank you for that, Shun.
[34:51.38]A lot of people saying you're all great.
[34:52.97]I think you guys are great.
[34:53.95]You guys are the one making the donations, giving the money.
[34:57.07]You guys are going to happen.
[34:58.37]Yeah.
[34:59.01]So we're okay.
[34:59.91]But for these stickers, I mean, do they have to stay on the shirt?
[35:05.98]It depends on if he wants to peel them off of his body.
[35:09.19]Yeah, I don't know about that.
[35:10.53]I don't have a lot of hair on my body.
[35:11.67]That might rip off some hair follicles.
[35:14.61]You're a real smooth boy.
[35:19.48]I'm giving you a nice like okay.
[35:25.37]We'll order it armor.
[35:27.19]Let's do one where Let's see how it sticks in yeah, this is gonna rip some hairs out.
[35:35.45]We'll do it real We'll do it real light, so it doesn't really rip out too many hairs, and I mean you can't see the hair But it's kind of like you know like peach fuzz all across this is gonna.
[35:44.10]Go.
[35:44.84]I felt it man.
[35:45.84]Yeah, I
[35:46.14]That was a cool noise.
[35:47.49]Really cool noise.
[35:48.27]That was a cool noise?
[35:48.97]Give us that one again if you can.
[35:50.12]I don't know if I can do it again.
[35:51.70]Too much pressure.
[35:54.49]There it was.
[35:55.03]I heard it.
[35:56.62]That's some nice volley work.
[35:59.00]Did can we get a clean did you say folly yeah Foley oh?
[36:04.77]Hey, that mispronounce is that mispronunciation by just said mispronunciation by the way as we get a new couch mispronunciation of folly Turn it off.

[36:17.52]We got it.
[36:18.08]Oh, yeah, but give me about love.
[36:20.37]Where's it going?
[36:21.19]Yeah, oh?
[36:22.27]Even if it's like DD5F with a dollar, you know, it all counts.
[36:26.24]And I missed like three or four in the beginning, too.
[36:28.78]So we're going to put like five on you right now.
[36:31.90]Are we still going down the arm?
[36:32.98]We're going to make you like an ornament.
[36:34.17]I'm scared of the arm, but, you know, whatever happens.
[36:38.03]We'll go like here.
[36:39.77]We'll do like three more on your arm area.
[36:43.68]Can we get it on the armpit hair?
[36:46.16]Just right in there.
[36:48.20]Whiskers not helping with the $20.
[36:49.40]He's a...
[36:52.45]Listen, we might run out of room.
[36:54.29]Yeah, the more you donate, the less shirt room we have, and then we have to move elsewhere.
[36:58.83]We have to move to the face.
[36:59.91]Yeah, we have to move to the face.
[37:02.52]We have to.
[37:03.78]We have to.
[37:04.80]You've got to get in there.
[37:05.90]We've got to keep going with these.
[37:07.92]We've got to make him a full sticker T-shirt.
[37:11.83]If he wasn't a smooth boy before, he will be when those stickers come off.
[37:17.02]Waxing.
[37:18.52]Sticker waxing.
[37:19.68]Live onto the mask.
[37:20.42]It's still bikini season.
[37:22.38]We're working our way.
[37:23.59]Isn't it bikini season?
[37:24.81]It should be a donation incentive.
[37:26.75]Yeah.
[37:28.27]We're trying to think of any donation incentives we can just kind of freeball.
[37:32.04]We're just kind of working with what we have here.
[37:34.30]Freeball.
[37:34.50]Get a Brazilian.
[37:35.40]What?
[37:37.17]That's a phrase?
[37:38.57]Isn't that... That's the...
[37:40.47]Can we get a new host?
[37:46.05]That's a thing.
[37:47.84]Or was that Nathan?
[37:49.81]Sorry.
[37:50.11]Oh, it's Springsteen?
[37:51.41]Yeah, yeah.
[37:53.45]Yeah.
[37:53.57]Yeah.
[37:53.69]Springsteen.
[37:54.07]Alright.
[37:54.43]If Springsteen said it, then it's okay.
[37:56.09]Whisker had a $20 donation saying, shout out to Flarp.
[37:59.42]Shout out to Flarp.
[38:00.42]Shout out to Flarp.
[38:01.32]Now, Nathan, somebody donated $10, and they said, proposal, Nate donates $20 every time he accidentally swears on stream.
[38:09.86]That happened last night, right?
[38:13.16]I have no recollection of that event.
[38:15.54]Okay, well, the archives will delete the VOD, I guess.
[38:19.17]Delete the 12-hour VOD of our charity event.
[38:22.39]Just bleep that out.
[38:23.15]Yeah, we can bleep it.
[38:24.67]We can bleep it.
[38:26.80]Yeah, I'm just clearing through some of the older donations here, but the pub, moving along.
[38:31.70]Lauren looking for someone to heal.
[38:33.13]Lauren just doing that healing thing.
[38:34.95]Yeah, I'm a kind person.
[38:35.93]Healing Jacob.
[38:36.91]Uh-oh.
[38:37.55]Oh, you get bounced up there.
[38:39.42]Oh, boy.
[38:40.82]That sticky trap will get you every time.
[38:42.88]Hello.
[38:44.32]How you doing?
[38:45.72]It was him all along.
[38:48.60]I think someone installed tags hacks on this computer.
[38:52.05]I was going nutty earlier, man.
[38:54.23]Nuttiness.
[38:55.19]Somebody made a CVS receipt reference last night.
[38:57.87]Yep.
[38:58.83]DJ, did you buy, like, one small Coke?
[39:01.74]Here you go.
[39:03.28]Wait till we do our bid on airline food later.
[39:06.54]That'll be wicked.
[39:08.56]Woo-hoo!
[39:09.58]Wow, look at this receipt.
[39:11.04]What?
[39:13.61]With airline food.
[39:15.75]Jacob, can you tell us, what is your favorite thing about camp, if you had to boil it down to one thing?
[39:22.32]I'm putting you on the spot again, I know, but you can take a second.
[39:24.81]That's a hard question.
[39:25.81]Yeah, you can take a minute to think about it.
[39:30.16]We'll just be here making jokes.
[39:32.24]Okay.
[39:32.72]Just, I mean, if you want a general answer, like, the people there are, oh, my goodness, they're so great, from, like, the counselors to the campers.
[39:41.65]Like, the counselors especially, they give up, like, two weeks of their life, some of them, to come spend it with us.
[39:48.78]And they're some of the most amazing people I've ever met.
[39:52.27]And, like, the kids alone, too.
[39:54.83]Some of my best friends, I talk to them every day.
[39:58.52]That's so cool.
[39:59.72]That's awesome that you keep those lasting relationships.
[40:01.67]That's awesome.
[40:02.41]Yeah, I don't have any of those.
[40:03.87]Such a cool system.
[40:05.73]Yeah.
[40:06.55]Nathan, what do you imagine is the coolest part of camp?
[40:09.99]It would be having friends, yeah.
[40:12.03]Yeah, boy.
[40:12.43]That is a part of it.
[40:13.94]So, I mean, Jacob, what's an average day at camp like?
[40:17.26]I mean, you don't have to, you know, start with, like, I stand up and I stand up out of bed, but, like, what kind of stuff do you do?
[40:23.44]You get up, you eat, probably.
[40:25.53]Walk us through, like, an average day on average.
[40:28.41]Okay, so I have, for the past four years, I've been in a program called Camp Craft, which I said is like the camping one.
[40:35.96]So when you get to like the 12 to 16 age range, you get to like choose your program.
[40:41.77]And I chose the camping one.
[40:44.10]So basically, get up in the morning at our tent and we cook breakfast and just chill out, listen to music, have a good time in the morning.
[40:55.31]And then we'll have like an activity.
[40:58.26]And then, but like my favorite part, I'll just skip to the like part of the end is my favorite part like of that is just sitting around the campfire and just talking.
[41:10.83]One of my favorite things from that,
[41:14.35]That's always the best.
[41:16.61]Ghost stories.
[41:16.91]Yeah.
[41:17.03]They always tell scary stories.
[41:18.83]Ghost stories, yeah.
[41:20.47]I'll tell you, the thing about Camp Craft, I was lucky enough when I volunteered at Summer Camp 2014 that when Camp Craft was back on site after the river incident, they were out there just grilling on the campus, and they invited me over to have some food.
[41:34.10]And here's the secret.
[41:35.10]Camp Craft often has the best food.
[41:37.58]They have the best goodies.
[41:38.48]They really know what they're doing.
[41:39.76]Oh, yeah.
[41:39.94]Because we make it all straight over the campfire.
[41:42.41]It's so good.
[41:43.01]Camp food is usually made in the kitchen.
[41:45.74]Which, don't get me wrong, the kitchen staff are all lovely at the camps as well, and the food there is great.
[41:49.78]But camp crap, sometimes, just that little bit, just right over the campfire.
[41:52.65]When it's made over a campfire, it's just so good.
[41:54.33]I don't know what it is.
[41:55.19]It's got that smoky flavor.
[41:57.16]The eggs are so amazing.
[41:59.86]Yeah.
[41:59.94]I just can't even explain it.
[42:01.58]So, Nate, you hear that?
[42:02.43]The best thing, not only do you get friends, you get eggs.
[42:06.05]Good eggs.
[42:06.61]Good eggs.
[42:07.18]Get some great breakfast food.
[42:09.18]That's what you're missing out on.
[42:10.46]Have you ever had eggs before, Nathan?
[42:13.67]I've never eaten... What kind of egg?
[42:15.49]Guys, can we get an Indiegogo or something going for Nathan?
[42:18.32]Let's get this guy some eggs.
[42:19.36]They're cheap.
[42:20.44]It's like two bucks.
[42:21.20]You get like a thousand eggs.
[42:23.87]know get two dozen two dozen eggs two dozen it reminds me that the indigo um there was a guy that made a program for trying to make a potato salad or something like that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah did that did that actually go through yeah yeah and did he make it he did he made a whole bunch of other incentives too it yeah there was an indiegogo where a guy said
[42:46.03]He was raising money to make potato salad.
[42:47.83]He ended up making, like he sent some out in the mail, possibly, I think.
[42:52.14]It ended up being this big thing, and there were souvenirs, and it was ridiculous.
[42:56.48]Was it good?
[42:57.78]I guess it was probably fine.
[42:58.68]Did anybody ever try it?
[43:00.13]I don't know.
[43:00.75]I didn't follow up on it.
[43:01.75]It was fine.
[43:03.23]We have a donation from our own Curtis Russ himself.
[43:06.53]Says, thanks to Slendini for buying my breakfast.
[43:09.64]Time to pay it forward and donate again.
[43:11.26]Shout out to Jacob, Nathan, and everyone involved in this segment.
[43:15.09]Pootis.
[43:16.85]Poot.
[43:17.59]Poot.
[43:17.97]You had to read that because it was in the message, right?
[43:20.17]You had to read those.
[43:20.81]Poot.
[43:21.87]Palm Spaghetti donated 50 bucks and says, I'm in your donations list.
[43:25.42]And there was smileys after every word.
[43:28.28]He, he, he, he, he, he.
[43:30.10]Was there a parentheses there?
[43:33.79]It was the parentheses smiley.
[43:35.15]It was just a regular smiley face, colon, parentheses.
[43:37.29]Yeah, but I was talking about the he, he, he.
[43:39.70]No, there was no he, he, he.
[43:41.34]It was implied in the tone of it.
[43:43.81]Whisker donated $20 and said, shout out to Flarp.
[43:46.19]I already read that one, bud.
[43:49.62]I just like the sound of that word.
[43:52.24]Regum donated $30 and said, greetings from Switzerland.
[43:55.61]Being to summer camps myself, I can tell that it is a great experience and I'm happy to help send someone too.
[44:01.66]And like we said, I mean, if you're just this second tuning into this charity thing for the very first time, One Step Camp, not only is it a super cool camp where you can do stuff, but a lot of the kids there that are currently going through treatment for cancer, they get their treatment right at camp, and I think that's what kind of sets it apart.
[44:21.05]Jacob, you're healing now.
[44:22.25]He's moved over to the Battle Med, it looks like.
[44:24.59]Just got kind of annihilated, but do the Battle Med.
[44:28.06]Did I inspire you?
[44:29.86]Trying to be like his hero, Loren.
[44:31.81]That's me.
[44:34.96]There goes my hero.
[44:38.74]Guys, do it for the karaoke block during the overnight, which we don't have.
[44:41.80]We're just going to be singing, not streaming it.
[44:44.33]I'll be doing it alone in my own life.
[44:47.77]That's what I'm doing.
[44:48.56]We're getting kind of close to having to... We got a lot of sneakers here.
[44:52.22]We're getting close.
[44:54.71]I did not realize that we get this many donations.
[44:58.47]You still got some room at the top right shoulder.
[45:00.32]Guys, keep donating so that we can hide Slynn completely.
[45:04.35]Now, when are we starting on the face and the head, Jerma?
[45:06.94]Was that like a quadruple air shot, Alex?
[45:08.70]Yeah, I just got the double.
[45:10.67]Yeah, we're slowly running out of Slynn real estate.
[45:14.75]We got some room over here in the armpit shoulder area.
[45:19.05]Mike, would you say we're covering Sleeves as Sleeves?
[45:21.59]We're covering Sleeves as Sleeves, yeah.
[45:23.14]Some of us were trying to say Steve and Slin at the same time yesterday, and it came out as Sleeves.
[45:30.18]What up, Sleeves?
[45:31.26]It's just a fun little nickname you came up with.
[45:33.25]twitch.tv/Sleeves.
[45:35.01]If you guys want to say anything to Sleeves, now is your chance.
[45:39.43]A beefcake donated $100.
[45:41.85]You could call that a Benjamin or a Benny.
[45:44.28]and the Jets.
[45:45.42]Good to hear that Jacob has a wonderful time at camp.
[45:48.36]Hope more kids will be able to have a good time as well.
[45:50.47]Here's $100.
[45:51.43]Thank you for all your hard work.
[45:53.23]TF2 community is the best gaming community.

[46:06.91]Here we go.
[46:07.83]Oh, boy.
[46:08.49]We got Jacob up on the screen.
[46:09.89]There you are, my man.
[46:10.79]There are the sunglasses, too.
[46:12.04]Nice sunnies, man.
[46:13.04]Yeah.
[46:14.69]How do you feel?
[46:15.39]Now you're definitely not camera shy now.
[46:16.97]You're stuck with us.
[46:17.99]That's a nice pic.
[46:18.93]Yeah, it is.
[46:19.51]That's a good angle.
[46:20.82]Was that a Lang photo?
[46:22.16]It'd be cool if there was a Lang photo that he took of Jacob.
[46:25.00]That would be like, everything's full circle.
[46:28.35]Wait, which picture did you guys find of me?
[46:34.34]Don't worry, it was a good one.
[46:34.98]It was a good one.
[46:35.70]It was one from camp, yeah.
[46:36.88]It wasn't in bad taste or anything like that.
[46:39.86]It's appropriate.
[46:40.75]You were wearing sunglasses.
[46:42.85]Yeah, exactly.
[46:44.15]Guys, speaking of incentive, the next one we're shooting for, I think, in terms of chronologically, is going to be the Pipe Launcher Jump Race.
[46:52.61]So $3,283 on that one.
[46:57.56]We want to get there, and those pipe bomb...
[47:00.99]Jumps, they're not easy.
[47:03.07]I don't know if anyone in our server here, the pub server wants to give it a shot, but I don't know.
[47:08.02]These jumpers, they've got stuff up their sleeve for us.
[47:11.29]So we want to donate for that $3,283 as of right now.
[47:16.21]And that is coming up a little later, the jump section.
[47:19.02]Right now we're looking at, we got $152.
[47:22.48]Jump is coming up at, well, right after this, very soon.
[47:26.85]Yeah.
[47:27.69]It's donating.
[47:28.63]I don't even understand how that's gonna be possible.
[47:31.03]That is like I I can't even rocket jump or sticky jump correctly Yeah, I can't imagine doing it with a pipe four seconds is the detonation Or is what you count to do it roughly four seconds, and then you jump the the pill also like starts flashing faster Yeah, so you can we got it.
[47:46.55]We got my guy here.
[47:47.33]Are you gonna be doing it?
[47:48.29]Oh, no I'm not gonna be doing that, but I just do it sometimes.
[47:50.45]Yeah, we're see later Wyatt.
[47:52.14]Oh
[47:52.16]Oh, boom.
[47:53.94]Bye-bye.
[47:54.26]The kid.
[47:55.71]Good thing you're not on camera for that.
[47:57.13]So long to the kid.
[48:00.06]Hey.
[48:00.66]Yeah, but that was cool.
[48:02.24]We got the tweet up.
[48:03.17]I mean, we've been trying to, you know, find different ways that we can sort of really humanize and drive home the point that this is a super real thing.
[48:13.00]You know, it's, I don't know, it's really real.
[48:15.86]A lot of people do donation events and charity events where they don't necessarily have personal contact or personal touch.
[48:22.93]You know, it might be a great charity, don't get me wrong, but...
[48:26.06]You don't get to see the stories of the real kids and the real people that it touches and affects.
[48:30.79]And we have staff here from One Step Camp and Children's Oncology Services.
[48:35.74]Yeah, and a couple of Tip of the Hats guys have also been.
[48:37.62]Yeah, we've all been there.
[48:38.42]I mean, we've got a very close, very special relationship.
[48:42.01]And it's, I don't know, it's amazing.

[49:55.87]Zonti, 10 bucks.
[49:58.79]Zonti, sorry, 10 bucks.
[50:00.27]Already bought the shirt, but I think the kids deserve more than 25 bucks.
[50:03.16]I'm with you, buddy.
[50:04.04]This is how much I can donate for now.
[50:05.94]Lang, I'm glad you like the fish art on Twitter.
[50:08.00]That must be the artist.
[50:08.88]Zonti made that art.
[50:10.14]Yeah, someone made a really wonderful fan art of me holding a fish with the tip lid on, and I retweeted it from my account, and I think we tweeted it from the Tip of the Hats account as well.
[50:20.01]I'm not sure.
[50:20.69]If not, we should get on that, whoever's... Jason, if you're watching, hopefully...

[50:43.58]Have some more money for this amazing camp.
[50:45.10]Jerm, can you do a little narration with the voice you did in that H1Z1 video before the plague hit?
[50:50.56]Now, what's that?
[50:51.08]I'm not familiar with that one.
[50:52.90]Do you remember that?
[50:53.87]Oh, he's referring to the character that I was doing.
[50:57.91]I guess.
[50:58.70]I guess.
[50:59.30]Alright.
[51:00.82]Well, I guess I'll do one.
[51:01.82]30 bucks.
[51:02.44]You got to keep track of the stickers when they come in.
[51:05.61]Put one on Jerma.
[51:06.97]You can stop putting them on me.
[51:08.65]Hey, this shirt, I don't want to ruin this shirt.
[51:11.21]This was a $30 Walmart shirt.
[51:13.92]I don't want to ruin it.
[51:15.78]I'm sure our donators will be happy to put down some money.
[51:18.37]It's not going to go to your shirt, but we can pretend.
[51:21.70]It's going to go to the camp.
[51:22.80]There's that picture.

[51:28.12]Yeah, Jacob going in for the three-shot.
[51:32.03]Two-shot, three-shot.
[51:33.39]Going around the side.
[51:34.73]Unfortunately, that's before the plague hit.
[51:36.54]No!
[51:37.24]No!
[51:37.72]And he got taken out there.
[51:39.96]But that's before the plague hit.
[51:41.91]2007.
[51:43.71]The plague hit.
[51:45.11]It was terrible.
[51:46.35]There was nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.
[51:48.30]You couldn't get away from those zombies before the plague hit.
[51:51.93]Wow.
