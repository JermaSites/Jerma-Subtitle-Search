[00:01.84]It's been one minute.
[00:04.26]It's been one solitary minute.
[00:06.69]Sorry, I had to pee.
[00:09.65]My mic seems really fucking loud.
[00:12.05]Hold on.
[00:17.39]It's a loud mic.
[00:19.39]Why is it so loud?
[00:22.39]It's probably better.
[00:22.98]How's that?
[00:26.48]That's a good thing.
[00:29.22]It's good like that.
[00:30.22]It's good.
[00:31.86]I don't like being loud.
[00:33.34]It's scary.
[00:36.54]Peek the mic?
[00:37.17]I have a compressor on, but... No, I'm not peeking any mics.
[00:40.67]Not right now.
[00:45.31]We want to hear your beautiful voice.
[00:47.04]Alright, I'm not supposed to be here.
[00:48.32]I'll be back.
[00:49.32]Just enjoy the intro.
[01:04.26]Okay, well, that tweet was not supposed to say that.
[01:08.29]I started writing... I wrote mall making stream, and then I put some words in front of it instead.
[01:13.77]That was going to be like chilling, making a mall.
[01:17.64]But now it just says chilling in my mall making stream.
[01:20.52]Well, I guess that's accurate.
[01:24.32]It's like two distinct thoughts.
[01:27.97]It's accurate, though.
[01:30.75]The first response is, what?
[01:33.47]I'm chilling in my mall making stream.
[01:35.87]That's easy to understand.
[01:37.04]That's fine.
[01:39.98]Anyways, hello.
[01:40.38]How are you guys doing?
[01:41.08]Hope you've had a good week.
[01:43.46]End.
[01:46.38]We are back for the next few days.
[01:49.04]Next few days is going to be a lot of grab bag stuff.
[01:52.87]Because the week after this one, we've got Halloween.
[01:57.15]Whole week.
[01:59.11]Of scary shit.
[02:00.87]Both VR and non-VR.
[02:07.96]We're also going to be going back to House Flipper.
[02:10.34]For a night.
[02:17.15]That's not scary, but... I gotta play it because the VR mode is coming out.
[02:22.21]At the end of this week.
[02:25.73]Finally gonna play Saw 2.
[02:27.96]Yeah.
[02:29.63]You will finally see Saw 2 on this channel next week.
[02:39.10]We got three or four VR scary games to play.
[02:41.94]Some of them are probably dog shit, but whatever.
[02:46.33]We have some non-VR games to play as well.
[02:52.43]And Chubby Bunny.
[02:53.23]Yes.
[02:54.20]Yes.
[02:57.12]Chubby bunny is next week, too.
[02:58.69]Why is that such a big announcement for everybody?
[03:00.79]You know what I mean?
[03:01.33]Why is that such a big deal?
[03:03.47]Oh, we've also, next week, we've got a big stream.
[03:05.41]Chubby bunny.
[03:07.71]It's not that, it's really not that cool.
[03:10.66]It's gonna be stupid.
[03:11.52]You're not even gonna think it's funny.
[03:18.44]It's so cool.
[03:20.52]It's the best, dude.
[03:22.42]Well, I will tell you.
[03:23.18]I'm probably the only streamer on Twitch that will have a Chubby Bunny segment of their stream.
[03:31.19]So, gotta get those accolades right where I can get them.
[03:36.71]Wrong.
[03:37.15]No one has done Chubby Bunny on Twitch.
[03:38.77]I'm almost certain of that.
[03:42.37]Who has done Chubby Bunny on Twitch?
[03:44.63]Oh, wow.
[03:45.07]Yeah, I'm...
[03:47.60]No one has done Chubby Bunny on Twitch.
[03:49.48]I don't believe you.
[03:50.66]No one has.
[03:55.58]Don't do it, though.
[03:56.83]Now I know why nobody's done it.
[03:57.97]Now I know why nobody wants to do it.
[03:59.17]Because it's dangerous.
[04:01.49]I'm going to have a doctor in my room.
[04:05.81]No, no, no, no, no, Jeremy.
[04:07.13]That's too many.
[04:08.39]You've done eight.
[04:10.13]If you do nine, your chance of dying goes up by 8% per bunny you put in there.
[04:16.19]Marshmallow you put in there.
[04:20.91]I'm being audited by the IRS.
[04:22.57]Well, you fucking shouldn't have lied on your taxes.
[04:33.50]Holy shit.
[04:34.86]And speaking of taxes, 20 community subs from Lagx.
[04:38.54]That's, we're talking about taxes.
[04:43.01]That's a lot of subs, thanks to the 20 subs, Lag.
[04:45.65]And Inkcat gave 5.
[04:51.92]Oh.
[04:54.50]Taxes.
[04:55.36]Dude, your tax is on stream.
[04:59.44]No, that's like the... Okay.
[05:01.88]I would rather... I would rather turn the webcam on and be 100% naked.
[05:08.04]No socks on either.
[05:10.51]Than have you do my taxes with me on stream.
[05:15.93]Like, I'd rather do 20 jumping jacks completely fucking naked and have a camera over my shoulder while we do my taxes together.
[05:26.90]Like, no, dude.
[05:28.28]Like, can I do the naked stream 10 times?
[05:39.61]Like Satan pops up.
[05:41.77]Jeremy, you have two choices.
[05:44.00]You either do your taxes on stream or you're naked on camera for a stream.
[05:49.20]Can I do 10 streams of being naked on camera instead?
[05:54.62]Yeah, I guess.
[05:56.18]I would rather do that.
[05:58.94]Oh, okay.
[06:02.10]And then he disappears.
[06:07.95]Anyways, today we're going to play the mall game.
[06:12.86]That's TOS.
[06:13.94]Yes, it is.
[06:16.92]I'm not going to do that.
[06:17.74]These are hypotheticals.
[06:20.70]So this is going to be kind of a chill stream.
[06:23.80]I can't even say that because it always ends up being untrue.
[06:26.45]This stream is going to be very exciting.
[06:29.11]Okay?
[06:29.41]It's going to be the most exciting stream you've ever been to.
[06:33.71]There.
[06:34.77]Now the opposite can happen.
[06:39.45]This is a game where you build a mall, and there's a bunch of little characters that go to the mall, and you can build whatever kind of mall you want.
[06:46.79]It was, uh, recommended to me.
[06:48.63]So I was like, yeah, dude, let's have, like, a just chill ResidentSleeper fucking PogChamp stream.
[06:59.07]Casino Inc.
[06:59.63]2?
[06:59.67]No.
[07:01.81]This is a lot less wild than Casino Inc.
[07:04.49]This is more like City Skylines, but it's a concentrated microscope on the mall aspect of City Skylines.
[07:13.61]And I think it's a little bit easier for somebody with a fucking dumb person brain, like me.
[07:22.64]I'll show you.
[07:23.12]And it's got like nice, cute, everyone just relax.
[07:25.40]It's gamer time.
[07:26.26]No, it's relaxing time.
[07:29.22]Relaxing time.
[07:34.97]I'm trying to figure out what I want to do.
[07:36.03]I could either do normal... I, by the way, already did the tutorial.
[07:40.31]Don't need it.
[07:41.51]Although there's probably some detailed stuff.
[07:43.88]Another interesting thing about this game.
[07:45.70]I don't know if this works, but, uh... Apparently, like, it's pulling people from Twitch from this... I don't know if you guys are going to be in the game or something.
[07:54.76]I don't know.
[08:01.58]So there's 4,051 people in the chat.
[08:06.33]Maybe it's gonna be... I don't know.
[08:07.55]I have no idea how this works.
[08:08.99]Holy shit, we get to fuck up his mall.
[08:12.33]Alright, well right now this... I think I might have... Okay, looks good.
[08:19.84]I don't know.
[08:20.12]There's no, like, accept or submit button.
[08:22.70]Is it just pulling these names?
[08:26.26]4KAndyOmegaLol.
[08:28.16]What the... What?
[08:28.76]4KAndy?
[08:37.50]That's a shitload of people.
[08:39.94]What do you mean 4k, Andy?
[08:44.48]That's a lot of people.
[08:46.46]That's tons of people.
[08:51.68]Oh, there's only 35,000 people watching.
[08:54.72]Oh, football stadium, Andy.
[08:57.70]Is that what you guys say to like the top streamers on Twitch?
[09:01.24]Oh, concert, Andy.
[09:02.38]Only like 100,000 people here.
[09:02.99]Concert, Andy.
[09:11.04]Look at that number fucking climbing.
[09:12.70]4600?
[09:13.35]Let's see when I refresh it again.
[09:17.21]Oh.
[09:18.37]It's alright.
[09:20.69]Is the audio broken?
[09:21.83]It shouldn't be.
[09:23.81]Alright, let's go.
[09:24.69]Oh, there you are!
[09:25.81]That's you!
[09:27.44]That's you.
[09:30.02]4.6k, Andy.
[09:30.58]It's been 10 minutes.
[09:32.46]Who cares?
[09:35.44]Alright, so we have to make a mall.
[09:36.84]Now, here's the question.
[09:37.46]Do you want me to play the video game?
[09:40.26]Or, you know, there's mild rat infestations.
[09:45.38]Mild shoplifting.
[09:46.38]I don't even know how that works.
[09:48.74]Or do you want me just to start with money and just go for it?
[09:54.21]I kind of know what I'm doing.
[09:59.29]Let's go for it.
[09:59.83]Alright, let's go.
[10:03.29]Look, if I can't do shit, if I'm like having a hard time, I'll just go to the standard mode and we'll have a fucking ResidentSleeper PogChamp stream.
[10:09.25]And that's what that means.
[10:10.09]It means it's like, oh, this is kind of relaxing for like cool game though, dude.
[10:14.17]Alright, $200,000, that's enough.
[10:18.00]Normal research, that's fine.
[10:19.44]Mild, severe, rat... I don't want to do that.
[10:21.96]That's probably going to be such a pain in the ass.
[10:25.58]Wait, staff have hunger and bladder needs?
[10:28.59]That's the default.
[10:29.27]I don't know if I want to do that.
[10:32.73]Drop lifting normal.
[10:33.49]These are default.
[10:34.17]I don't have someone play default.
[10:35.75]Severe.
[10:36.45]Severe.
[10:36.85]Severe.
[10:37.25]Severe.
[10:37.85]No.
[10:38.11]I'm just doing normal.
[10:41.74]Standard demand.
[10:42.50]Standard prices.
[10:47.58]Okay.
[10:47.76]Here we go.
[10:49.02]Alright.
[10:49.92]This is what we got to start with.
[10:52.02]Pretty tiny.
[10:53.32]This is our builder.
[10:54.42]Are they in Twitch chat?
[10:55.46]They are.
[10:56.50]Double zero trash man.
[10:57.94]Welcome.
[10:58.42]I don't know who the fuck you are, but you're like the first person.
[11:00.42]Therefore, you're the most important person.
[11:03.21]This is the most important person in the stream right now.
[11:08.33]00trashman.
[11:09.43]Apparently you're 28.
[11:10.39]Is that real?
[11:10.93]Is that pulling?
[11:12.69]That person's not here.
[11:15.21]Wait, hold on.
[11:15.71]This is not a person?
[11:17.21]They left the stream?
[11:18.51]Oh, man.
[11:19.31]It's too bad.
[11:19.97]It's too bad they took that 4K Andy joke to heart.
[11:27.89]It's me.
[11:29.26]Alright, let's see.
[11:30.42]Alright, so this is what we got.
[11:31.84]Look at this shit.
[11:33.37]Do you see how fucking crazy this could be?
[11:35.87]Let's... Alright, let's do this right.
[11:39.07]Every mall I've ever been to... Pause the game.
[11:41.05]I don't... Yeah, it's paused.
[11:41.87]Okay.
[11:42.97]Every single mall I've ever been to always has to start out a certain way.
[11:45.83]I hate, with a passion, malls that have parking in the middle of...
[11:54.24]Where the people have to walk out arou- No, no, no.
[11:56.32]No parking in the fucking middle.
[11:57.62]It's a disaster.
[11:59.10]Parking in huge parking lots on the outside.
[12:03.48]I hate this shit.
[12:04.36]When there's like a road that leads into the middle, and there's like parking here, and then like shops all around it.
[12:09.64]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:10.76]I don't like that.
[12:12.49]I want big parking lot, huge part of the mall.
[12:16.01]Big parking lot, huge part of the mall.
[12:18.59]Big parking lot.
[12:19.37]Get those cars out of here.
[12:20.97]They're a distraction.
[12:24.01]Let's start that here.
[12:24.79]Okay, road work.
[12:26.71]300 bucks for a road.
[12:28.85]Uh, what is this?
[12:30.97]Why is this little build- Why is this, like, a little, like, center here?
[12:35.17]That's not a mall.
[12:35.93]Yes, it is.
[12:38.53]Alright, there's four parking spaces.
[12:43.00]This is, like, the maintenance person, right?
[12:46.24]Yeah, the builder.
[12:47.32]This is, like, the builder hut.
[12:49.46]They vape?
[12:51.65]Wait, they actually, they vape, and they can't, and they've been continent.
[12:56.19]Wait, what?
[12:57.17]Why are these here?
[12:59.37]Can't resist e-cigarettes, and bladder can't go below 50.
[13:03.66]Can't resist diapers.
[13:08.26]Okay, well, this has got a little more interesting.
[13:11.04]Alright, let's go.
[13:13.36]So I'm going to say, let's start our building here.
[13:17.85]We need a foundation, so... I want the first store to be... Should I just do like a giant fucking box?
[13:27.49]Oh, that's $942,000.
[13:29.81]Never mind.
[13:31.19]I cannot... Oh shit, what'd I do?
[13:35.25]How much money do I have?
[13:37.44]I have $200,000.
[13:38.46]Fuck, this mall sucks.
[13:39.52]It's gonna be tiny.
[13:40.42]How do you make a mall with 200 grain?
[13:41.48]You need like 200 million.
[13:44.83]Alright, we're just gonna do a little store first.
[13:46.19]We'll expand.
[13:47.25]Right here.
[13:47.89]Ready?
[13:49.13]This'll just be like a fucking CVS.
[13:53.45]27 fucking thousand dollars, dude.
[13:54.77]What the hell is this shit?
[13:57.07]Okay.
[13:57.99]Now we're gonna build that up.
[13:59.45]The build is gonna go double zero trash, man.
[14:01.24]Go ahead and start building.
[14:05.46]When you pause the stream, I need to go pee.
[14:06.76]I'll be right back.
[14:08.26]No.
[14:10.84]Is the mall- Is it open?
[14:17.05]You've almost won Wendy's.
[14:18.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14:21.23]Wait, who's this?
[14:23.43]What?
[14:23.91]Who the fuck are you?
[14:26.17]ASF Max.
[14:28.41]Okay, this is you.
[14:30.59]Manage.
[14:32.38]Where did you come from?
[14:33.00]It's fucking Bugleberry.
[14:38.72]Alright, now I know everyone's like, oh wow, mouse over and see where I am.
[14:41.76]There's gonna be like 5,000 people on the screen eventually.
[14:44.36]Like, I can't do that.
[14:46.85]They're not here either.
[14:52.21]Not a real... Wait, hold on.
[14:53.20]Oh, 4K Andy?
[14:57.66]Yeah, okay.
[15:05.07]6K Andy.
[15:07.67]What, you just... Every time we go up in numbers, you just add an Andy after it?
[15:14.86]Alright, so that's it.
[15:15.44]We got that.
[15:16.32]Now we're gonna build, uh, we need to have, so this is gonna be like a CVS.
[15:20.77]Foundation.
[15:21.25]How much money do I have?
[15:21.81]Because you have to have a storeroom.
[15:24.77]So I need a wall here.
[15:26.45]Do it!
[15:26.61]What the fuck is going on?
[15:31.46]Oh.
[15:32.74]That's too small.
[15:36.48]Build a, build a, oh, that's a foundation.
[15:39.12]Oops.
[15:42.71]Okay, build it.
[15:48.35]What are they doing?
[15:51.79]Why do they just have like a panic in there?
[15:53.17]Oh, there's no door.
[15:54.77]There's no door.
[15:55.15]I need a door here.
[15:58.95]Staff door.
[15:59.53]I don't want anyone just going in here.
[16:01.67]And then a little double door here.
[16:03.29]Okay.
[16:04.15]Build that shit.
[16:08.53]There we go.
[16:09.21]Look at these two.
[16:10.17]Look at these two hard workers.
[16:14.85]Okay.
[16:15.13]Can I put like a couch in here?
[16:19.23]Alright, now I need- I need a door here.
[16:20.93]Staff door.
[16:22.55]And then this is gonna be the storage room.
[16:24.73]So we need to assign the- Look, I did the tutorial already.
[16:26.81]You think I'm a fucking stupid idiot?
[16:29.27]So that you have- Every st- If it's a store, it has to have storage.
[16:33.16]Otherwise, you can't stock the shelves.
[16:36.46]It's kind of a tongue twister.
[16:38.72]This is storage.
[16:40.00]And this is the stor- Wait, hold on.
[16:42.04]Bathroom.
[16:43.02]Oh, shit.
[16:43.50]Hold on.
[16:43.74]We need a- I need a wall.
[16:46.86]You're good at video games.
[16:49.95]It hasn't even been five minutes, man.
[16:54.43]Fucking stupid idiot.
[16:56.87]Okay.
[16:58.31]Okay, Andy.
[17:00.47]Uh, I need a bathroom.
[17:04.51]Is that too big?
[17:05.95]How big is this door?
[17:06.91]This door is a storage room and a bathroom.
[17:10.35]Could this be a staff bathroom?
[17:13.33]Is this going to be like half of those stores you go into?
[17:15.17]And it's like, oh, do you guys have a bathroom?
[17:16.97]Uh, yeah, but you ain't going in it.
[17:18.93]Oh, okay, thanks.
[17:25.94]Next time that happens, just hold up a $20 bill.
[17:28.64]You guys got a bathroom?
[17:30.40]Oh, Mr. Elbertson, right this way.
[17:33.02]And then they leave me at the back exit.
[17:37.69]Close the door and lock it.
[17:41.06]Alright, we need a door.
[17:42.20]Pause this.
[17:42.58]I don't want this thing to be open yet.
[17:45.52]Okay, we need a door.
[17:48.00]A see-through door?
[17:48.82]Isn't that kind of weird?

[36:34.63]I'm sorry, Cole.
[36:36.71]You are fired for being a fake viewer.
[36:42.42]There's like a little bit of a queue here.
[36:45.80]Daddy Deutschland.
[36:48.32]Toby Walsh.

[36:56.63]Dennis Parsons says, Great app.
[36:59.49]Must download.
[37:01.39]I had much fun on app.

[38:10.04]Shit, she's gone.
[38:10.98]No, she's not right there.
[38:11.54]Alright, I'm gonna have two office workers.
[38:18.52]Shift planning, too.
[38:19.54]That's cool.
[38:20.14]Okay.
[38:21.30]Now we need to do... Now we need doors, obviously.

[38:31.11]And let's put a trash can here.
[38:34.79]And let's get a... We need, like, computers in here, right?
[38:41.62]Or office?
[38:42.70]What do we need in an office?

[38:45.62]Okay, cool.
[38:47.18]Which does this go?
[38:50.55]Oh, that's too close.
[38:51.29]I would hate that.
[38:51.97]There we go.
[38:54.77]We can set up a net here and you guys can play ping pong.
[38:59.49]We gotta give him a plant, too.
[39:04.89]There, see?
[39:05.67]It's so comfy in here.
[39:10.19]What a drab, horrible place to be.
[39:17.17]This is just like Dictator.
[39:21.65]What's the problem?
[39:22.91]You've got a plant.
[39:26.62]And you have company.
[39:28.24]And a trash can.
[39:31.36]Alright, where are my office workers?
[39:33.78]Get in there.
[39:37.86]Where are they?
[39:38.58]I have $155, ooh, that doesn't look good.
[39:40.18]Alright, manage.
[39:42.54]Office four.
[39:44.22]When do you work?
[39:44.84]Nine to 17?
[39:46.00]Oh, come on.
[39:48.80]We just ended the work day.
[39:51.40]This is closed.
[39:52.35]How much money did I make?
[39:55.43]Upcoming events.
[39:56.27]Back to school season.
[39:57.29]Oh shit.
[39:57.73]Is this really a mall or is this a gas station?
[40:02.34]Hold on a minute.
[40:03.10]This is the entryway to the mall.
[40:05.66]You gotta start small.
[40:08.86]CVS closes at 5.
[40:09.90]Why?
[40:12.72]Alright, build.
[40:13.38]Now we're gonna do... I need another store.
[40:15.84]I need something more specific.
[40:18.10]What should be right here?
[40:20.45]About a... Should I just do this, like, back to back?
[40:31.25]Make another CVS.
[40:33.47]This mall sucks.
[40:36.11]This is not even the mall.
[40:38.05]This is the city.
[40:39.33]Of course there's a CVS, like, next to the mall.
[40:43.08]Just like how there's a movie theater right here too.
[40:45.12]And yes, I am going to make a movie theater here.
[40:46.88]Alright, we need a huge parking lot.
[40:50.08]I'm getting... Let's go.
[40:51.34]It's time.
[40:52.86]Huge parking lot right here.
[40:54.58]Yeah, no, fuck that.
[40:55.24]We're just going to make a huge... Yeah, okay, here we go.
[40:58.54]We're going to make a huge road down here.
[41:00.16]This is just like the little stop before you get to the mall.
[41:03.72]Here we go.
[41:05.06]Big, big, big-ass parking lot.
[41:08.26]You cannot build two-by-two roadblocks.
[41:10.42]What?
[41:10.54]What are you talking about?
[41:16.33]Wait, why not?
[41:19.99]No money.
[41:20.43]I have 155 grand.
[41:20.99]This guy works all night.
[41:27.61]We can't get another worker?
[41:28.57]Okay, I did this kind of wrong.
[41:38.68]I did this wrong.
[41:39.92]It wants to be a turn.
[41:42.14]Oh, good thing you fixed it.
[41:43.18]Thank you.
[41:44.71]I got all night to figure this out.
[41:46.03]Oh shit.
[41:50.07]Okay, um... I kind of messed that up a little.
[41:54.83]New businesses people want.
[41:56.11]A grocery store.
[41:57.63]Open a store with 50% of food to create a grocery store.
[42:01.46]Open a store with drugs to create a pharmacy.
[42:03.26]Well, that's what this is supposed to be.
[42:04.58]What is this?
[42:07.22]This is a gas station.
[42:12.36]This is not even a store.
[42:13.47]This store is horrible.
[42:14.59]It's- what is in here?
[42:20.09]There's... Action figures, sports balls, tampons, diapers, and toilet paper.
[42:26.71]This is just a toilet paper store.
[42:34.42]That's so bad.
[42:35.68]It's a huge bathroom.
[42:38.90]Yeah, you go in here, you use the toilets, and then you buy the toilet paper right here on the diapers and stuff.
[42:44.06]It's just a big... Yeah, that's okay.
[42:47.98]I'll just rename it.
[42:57.13]Uh... The big bathroom.
[43:02.59]How about that?
[43:06.45]toilet store no that's that's like a Steve Carell joke alright so I need to figure out what I pause this before I lose my mind alright do you uh do you guys see do you guys see like a chimpanzee with his arm up being like hey like like do you see that
[43:37.42]You see it, right?
[43:40.60]He's doing kind of like a, look at me!
[43:44.48]Three legs?
[43:47.12]Okay, well, let's not focus on that.
[43:52.68]Alright, the big bathroom, that gross profit.
[43:55.04]Look at this!
[43:56.66]$297.
[43:56.76]It's a $99 net profit.
[43:59.18]Salaries and maintenance.
[43:59.98]Look at this shit.
[44:04.11]I'm making money on that.
[44:05.07]Alright, I need to do...
[44:09.19]I need that.
[44:09.61]Okay, research, research, research, right?
[44:13.96]Allows opening business.
[44:15.24]You are researching this project.
[44:16.62]It's 24 man hours left.
[44:21.26]What?
[44:22.48]Well, let's see if they get anything done.
[44:24.52]Okay, build.
[44:25.86]I need to have customer parking.
[44:32.10]Wait a minute.
[44:34.03]I really, really blew this, huh?
[44:35.19]Didn't I?
[44:36.27]So this is all wrong.
[44:45.97]Well, these are gonna lead- I don't- where are these gonna lead to?
[44:51.60]Can I delete roads?
[44:57.86]Staff only parking!
[44:59.24]Oh, that makes sense.
[45:03.64]You can't save this.
[45:04.78]Yes, I can.
[45:05.98]Let me just figure out what I want to do.
[45:07.92]Build.
[45:08.26]I'm gonna do what I was gonna do before.
[45:12.36]I need to- I need to delete this shit.
[45:13.90]Remove roadwork.
[45:14.54]Here we go.
[45:16.40]Get rid of this stuff.
[45:19.25]I fucked it all up.
[45:20.29]Look, I'm learning.
[45:25.05]Okay.
[45:25.57]That looks a little bit... Now we're gonna go... This is for here.
[45:28.23]And for here.
[45:29.63]We're gonna make this road go this way.
[45:31.23]There we go.
[45:36.04]Check this out.
[45:47.86]I kind of hope the beat doesn't drop and it just stays like this.
[45:57.61]It's almost time to open.
[46:02.85]The workers will get to work.
[46:05.31]Now we'll do customer parking.
[46:06.61]Check this out.
[46:07.27]Here we go.
[46:10.33]Oh yeah.
[46:13.73]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[46:15.03]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[46:18.55]Parking everywhere.
[46:20.05]Parking, parking, parking, parking, parking.
[46:21.95]Parking, parking, parking.
[46:24.64]More parking.
[46:25.34]Are they working?
[46:30.42]They are, nice.
[46:31.00]Alright, this door is open.
[46:36.94]There's a Cevectro.
[46:39.06]He's a former guard.
[46:40.88]And he's a fashion victim.
[46:43.49]He's got security experience.
[46:47.41]No room left to expand.
[46:48.94]What do you mean?
[46:51.14]I'm gonna put something here.
[46:51.90]Okay, build foundation.
[46:59.38]This is a big one.
[47:00.18]This is a huge one.
[47:01.14]Whatever this is needs to be big.
[47:02.34]Okay.
[47:13.32]That's a lot of money.
[47:14.00]That was a ton of money.
[47:14.70]I hope it was worth it.
[47:19.46]What's this for?
[47:21.92]It's for extra long hot dog cars.
[47:27.80]It's for like a subway foot long.
[47:30.57]You're making the kind of mall you just talked about.
[47:34.07]No, but this is, I know, but this is not the mall.
[47:36.51]This is the beginning of the mall.
[47:41.07]Look, I can't just build, the game mechanics make it so I can't just build like a thousand parking spaces.
[47:50.86]How do they get into the mall?
[47:52.22]Right here!
[47:56.41]This is the mall!
[47:57.63]This is the mall right here, guys.
[47:59.63]There's gonna be like five stores in here.
[48:03.85]Stop questioning my ingenious ingenuity.
[48:15.46]Look, you want to just go to the CVS?
[48:16.86]Go to the CVS.
[48:17.39]Well, whatever.
[48:17.93]You have to go to the bathroom?
[48:18.87]Go to the bathroom over here.
[48:21.23]Alright, it's time.
[48:22.69]Look at all these parking spaces.
[48:26.63]What else can I research?
[48:28.36]Alcohol license?
[48:29.54]Oh yeah, we definitely need a bar.
[48:30.52]Alright, I need the offices to be way bigger than this.
[48:34.76]Expand.
[48:36.52]Expand this shit right now.
[48:38.67]Expand it.
[48:49.07]We gotta have like five people working in here.
[48:50.53]Hey, that looks good.
[48:55.75]Build it.
[49:01.93]Red stocks sell.
[49:04.27]Oh shit.
[49:06.19]This is gonna take this guy all week.
[49:10.63]Come on.
[49:11.27]Why is he doing it like this?
[49:12.23]He's like having fun.
[49:15.47]Is this like Twitch chat making a dick on screen?
[49:20.81]It is.
[49:22.83]Just wait till I get my actual stores getting ready.
[49:26.79]He's doing Picross.
[49:28.35]Why is he doing it like this?
[49:31.70]Is he going home?
[49:32.56]Hey!
[49:33.70]No, don't go!
[49:34.30]Alright, alright.
[49:34.76]We got... We got this guy coming in.
[49:37.06]He kinda looks scary.
[49:39.38]He's 75 years old?
[49:40.62]This is just... You just fucked this whole thing up, man.
[49:52.41]Leave him.
[49:55.03]What if he dies?
[49:56.87]What's this say?
[49:58.09]Word of mouth.
[49:58.59]New business.
[49:59.72]People want a grocery store so bad.
[50:01.20]Okay, okay, okay.
[50:03.50]We'll go, go, go.
[50:05.04]Alright.
[50:06.06]We can just do super fast speed.
[50:09.30]Let's get another office desk.
[50:16.15]And... Look, it's a fucking office.
[50:20.07]These two are friends.
[50:22.08]These two are friends.
[50:23.54]We have two friends, like, buddies working together, and there's one person in the middle.
[50:32.84]This is a call center.
[50:34.03]Oh, mega lull.
[50:35.43]Well, no, it's an office center.
[50:38.77]The middle dude feels bad.
[50:49.79]Okay, I need to hire some office workers.
[50:53.39]Hire office workers.
[50:54.04]We need three more.
[50:54.72]Okay, we have Camelith.
[51:00.38]Sheep David.
[51:02.10]Sheep David's a cook.
[51:05.24]None of you people, I think, are good for this.
[51:11.23]Office work.
[51:11.95]Office work.
[51:12.41]You're all bad at office work.
[51:14.01]Can I get a new group?
[51:18.13]No, none of you are any good.
[51:20.96]I'll wait.
[51:21.24]I still have to do the rest of the parking.
[51:29.74]I need staff parking somewhere.
[51:31.98]Staff parking is going to be right here.
[51:34.70]No, staff parking is going to be here.
[51:36.60]No.
[51:37.54]Staff parking is going to be here.
[51:39.96]Yep.
[51:41.18]Yep.
[51:46.10]There's so many parking spots.
[51:47.38]We'll just wait until I get my stores in here.
[51:50.35]Wait till this 100-year-old man finishes the building.
[51:59.49]It's alright.
[52:01.01]We're in our building phase.
[52:02.17]That means... Okay, I'm just gonna hire them.
[52:07.35]I don't care.
[52:07.73]Hire office worker.
[52:10.33]Fine.
[52:10.57]Paul Resley?
[52:21.04]Research the big data project to uncover this person's traits.
[52:24.26]One more.
[52:26.70]And, uh... Sheep David, sure.
[52:29.72]We're gonna convert Sheep David into a waiter, eventually.
[52:35.38]Auto salary, that's fine.
[52:38.10]Okay.
[52:39.36]Oh shit, this is not technically an office, is it?
[52:40.99]Okay, there we go.
[52:44.51]Now it is.
[52:45.85]I don't... Office 4, that annoys me.
[52:55.17]There you go, the research done.
[52:58.59]The friend zone.
[53:03.03]How we doing in products?
[53:07.25]How's the big bathroom doing?
[53:09.51]That's 22% of margins.
[53:13.87]Main category, health and beauty.
[53:15.17]Diapers and they're linked to the storage one.
[53:17.08]Okay.
[53:20.62]Set duration, opening hour.
[53:22.42]So it opens at 9.
[53:25.25]Those are terrible margins.
[53:28.46]Okay, 22% is not bad.
[53:30.60]How is that a bad margin?
[53:35.44]You get 22% profit every month?
[53:42.23]Margins are too big.
[53:43.73]Oh boy, look at this!
[53:46.29]They heard about the big sale!
[53:47.41]Uh-oh.
[53:49.65]Oh no, these are just workers!
[53:51.47]I have to pay these people!
[53:53.28]No, I thought those were people coming to the big bathroom.
[53:57.37]Alright, get to work.
[54:07.38]Hanging around.
[54:07.98]Traits.
[54:08.84]Satisfaction.
[54:09.76]Okay.
[54:10.76]Speed, patience, and social ability.
[54:14.06]Alright, we can level these people up.
[54:17.88]Still going on this.
[54:20.49]I may have made this a little too big.
[54:24.90]Okay, here we go.
[54:29.37]Sluggish.
[54:31.33]Motorola's.
[54:33.39]Justin Baker.
[54:35.41]He's browsing the pads and tampons.
[54:38.47]Good.
[54:39.80]Buy them.
[54:41.62]You can go faster than that.
[54:42.62]Scan it fast.
[54:46.04]George Chaney.
[54:48.82]Nice.
[54:49.08]Alright, that's a sale.
[54:51.70]He was a former janitor?
[54:53.42]Easy, don't cross the street like that.
[54:59.24]Wait, people can't run over, can they?
[55:01.32]I hope they can.
[55:03.60]Hurry up and build this!
[55:05.38]I need to make a school supply thing.
[55:06.93]I need like an office space.
[55:09.57]Office, uh, max, or whatever they're called.
[55:11.35]Office depot.
[55:18.93]Okay.
[55:19.27]This is exciting.
[55:21.44]This is where it really begins.
[55:23.68]Yes.
[55:24.54]Okay.
[55:25.64]Chill in there for a little bit.
[55:27.36]Let's think about a plan here.
[55:30.42]Alright, we need a couple... Okay.
[55:32.88]We need to really think about this.
[55:35.34]Walls.
[55:36.65]I'm thinking about... Here's all the parking.
[55:40.41]The entrance is right here.
[55:42.25]Right?
[55:43.13]Entrance will be right here.
[55:43.99]Staff entrance will be back here.
[55:48.06]If you think about that.
[55:49.38]Let's have a staff entrance.
[55:53.04]Where should I put this?
[55:53.68]How about... Like this.
[56:03.45]And then like this.
[56:05.23]Right?
[56:06.09]Okay, that's one.
[56:06.75]Do I have to have a storage room?
[56:13.85]For each store?
[56:16.96]Because these are all going to be like little shops.
[56:19.74]No, this is the bathroom.
[56:23.68]This is the bigger bathroom.
[56:28.16]No!
[56:32.00]Okay, the big bathroom, the bigger bathroom, and then the mall.
[56:37.76]Don't give me stupid ideas like that.
[56:39.66]I only have $49,000.
[56:40.02]And then the biggest bathroom.
[56:52.03]Just have the back whole third be storage.
[56:53.87]Alright, that's probably a better idea.
[57:00.77]So like this.
[57:01.85]Just have the whole thing.
[57:02.87]This is just huge storage.
[57:04.59]For our like three stores.
[57:06.98]Bigger than the biggest bathroom.
[57:08.64]The bankrupt bathroom.
[57:15.34]I need money, dude.
[57:16.76]I need to sell shit.
[57:17.68]Okay, assign.
[57:18.88]Storage.
[57:21.38]Storage.
[57:25.55]Storage 5.
[57:27.37]Storage 6.
[57:28.75]And storage 7 for the stores that are going to be here.
[57:32.29]Because it has to be different storage for different stores.
[57:39.29]It's uneven.
[57:40.33]Oh, no.
[57:50.31]Whatever.
[57:50.77]Fuck, I was trying to... Hey, stop!
[57:56.79]I want to do it to storage 6.
[57:58.01]Storage 6 needs to be... Oh, fuck.
[58:03.06]What have I done?
[58:07.12]Storage 6.
[58:09.72]Oh, my fucking god.
[58:11.05]I... No.
[58:20.93]I want to do...
[58:25.99]I can't even eyeball that.
[58:27.05]You understand?
[58:33.36]There.
[58:33.78]Okay.
[58:34.16]It's not even by one square.
[58:35.30]Who cares?
[58:37.08]Storage five is consumed all.
[58:38.76]Alright.
[58:39.00]Here we go.
[58:40.62]Let's see what we got.
[58:41.54]Restroom.
[58:43.13]Wait.
[58:43.89]Need a wall.
[58:44.93]This is a big store.
[58:46.17]This is three different stores in here.
[58:48.01]Is this going to be a food court?
[58:53.21]What?
[58:57.12]No, no, no, I need, like, retail.
[58:59.90]Store.
[59:00.52]Okay, but I need walls.
[59:04.46]Walls.
[59:04.86]Alright, so this is store.
[59:05.84]Fuck.
[59:07.48]Staff comes in through here.
[59:08.52]And then, let's see, how am I gonna block this out?
[59:15.37]Needs to be a grocery store.
[59:16.47]Okay.
[59:17.05]What kind of stupid shitty mall has a grocery store in it?
[59:20.57]What mall has a- Oh, yeah, there's a, uh, you know, there's a stop and shop inside of this mall.
[59:34.15]This is store one.
[59:37.11]Right?
[59:38.81]Yeah.
[59:39.81]Looking good.
[59:41.69]This is gonna be store two.
[59:46.35]Looking good.
[59:49.06]Store three is right here.
[59:52.00]Oh, bingo.
[59:56.36]Nice.
[59:56.76]Okay.
[59:58.26]This is staff door, staff door, staff door, staff door.
[60:01.16]Regular door, regular door, regular door.
[60:03.86]Bathroom.
[60:05.56]No, fuck, hold on.
[60:06.40]What if it goes here?
[60:07.17]Okay, store.
[60:15.35]I can only do a store right now.
[60:20.10]Maintenance center, store.
[60:22.32]Alright, we need a grocery store.
[60:24.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[60:26.16]How about this is just the grocery store?
[60:29.41]And then I'll add a storage thing on the left.
[60:31.85]Then you can just go to... There's other stores in the grocery store.
[60:36.61]Right?
[60:38.63]But like, you're shopping around... This would be sick, actually.
[60:41.09]Like, are you kidding me?
[60:42.79]You have your shopping cart and you're going through the grocery store and there's like a Best Buy right over there?
[60:47.93]That would be cool.
[60:51.67]You could just go in with your groceries and put like a TV in with your bread and eggs.
[60:59.77]My ice cream would melt.
[61:01.59]Well, seems like we have a, uh, we have somebody who doesn't understand how to grocery stuff.
[61:06.04]You do your frozen and your cold shit last.
[61:10.22]Why are you buying ice cream first?
[61:12.60]You, ice cream, deli meat, meat, cheeses, they all, that's all last.
[61:19.01]Hold on, wait, you guys, you guys put cold shit in your grocery shopping cart within five to ten minutes of getting in there?
[61:27.69]Is that the first thing you do?
[61:31.78]That's not a good idea.
[61:32.76]That's horrible.
[61:35.40]If you get ground beef and you're in the grocery store for 40 minutes, and then it's like, what?
[61:40.38]10, 20 plus maybe minutes, 30 minutes to get home?
[61:44.82]You have ground beef that's been outside of a fridge for like an hour and 20 minutes.
[61:51.75]Think about that.
[61:54.65]Alright, so this is the grocery store.
[61:57.67]And then this is the other stores.
[62:00.05]Ooh, this is gonna be fun.
[62:00.79]Okay.
[62:00.95]Okay.
[62:08.58]Nice.
[62:08.94]Dude, this is big enough to be... We just had three checkout lines and then a bunch of food.
[62:13.00]40 Minute Andy.
[62:22.71]There's no bathroom here.
[62:23.67]Look, you gotta go to the bathroom.
[62:24.85]Just go over there.
[62:26.89]I can add it later over this way.
[62:29.81]Alright, we need doors.
[62:31.19]Let me... Actually, I gotta name these.
[62:34.13]Store 8.
[62:34.71]This is Grocery Store.
[62:37.48]This is Grocery's.
[62:41.61]Store 7.
[62:42.31]Store... Wait, wait, wait.
[62:45.35]Store 9.
[62:47.21]What's this?
[62:47.81]This is gonna be, uh, DVDs.
[62:49.61]It's gonna be DVDs.
[62:51.93]Um... What should this be?
[62:53.59]DVDs?
[62:54.39]I don't think I have access to DVDs yet.
[62:56.04]Are they even working?
[63:02.28]Oh, alcohol license.
[63:03.54]Shit.
[63:08.26]Oh, no.

[63:13.73]I need more people in the office.
[63:16.69]Expand.
[63:17.89]Expand.
[63:34.24]Expand, please.
[63:39.80]Your CVS is not going to cover the wage expenses of all this.
[63:44.42]This is the money maker.
[63:50.61]Yeah, my $30 in net profit from the diaper CVS store is not going to cover the expenses.
[63:56.23]This is just shitty business management and business development 101.
[64:00.61]Oh, we turned a profit slightly for one week.
[64:04.45]Expand.
[64:07.18]And then expand again.
[64:13.21]I only have 31 grand.
[64:14.63]Oh, I gotta slow down.
[64:16.21]Alright, we need to make... Oh boy, we need to slow down.
[64:21.07]Is this an obvious drug front?
[64:26.53]I'm not really getting very many customers anymore.
[64:31.70]Oh, this is not good.
[64:32.84]Maybe it's because it's only tampons, diapers, and toilet paper.
[64:38.16]Maybe it's because there's no other product.
[64:40.68]And now we're closed.
[64:46.77]make this huge ass grocery store mall alright wait wait wait wait wait I can fix this the office is bigger than the store just relax everybody you tell me to relax you guys relax just relax

[66:44.18]Once I get the grocery store going, people want grocery stores bad.
[66:46.30]Okay, groceries.
[66:47.96]I need to, uh, build a storage over here.

[67:24.32]I can't do this.
[67:25.32]We have to cancel this all.
[67:28.24]Inaccessible work order.
[67:30.14]Builders can't access work orders.
[67:31.40]What the fuck are you talking about?
[67:33.08]I need a grocery store.
[67:33.88]Okay, we're gonna sacrifice all this stuff that we just put in here.

[67:50.97]How do I stop him from doing this?
[67:56.93]I can't, like, stop him.
[68:00.85]Is it too late?
[68:03.21]Sell, sell, sell.
[68:04.35]I can't.
[68:05.57]I think I have to sell them as he builds them.
[68:16.86]Stop!
[68:27.56]Does it sell it?
[68:30.98]Does it sell this or does it just delete it?
[68:36.76]Oh, it's just delete.
[68:40.73]Fuck.
[68:41.67]Oh no.
[68:43.55]I didn't realize.
[68:44.41]It's okay.
[68:45.63]It's okay.
[68:46.27]We'll have enough money.
[68:46.93]We're gonna have enough money.
[68:49.95]Ooh!
[68:53.27]Okay, we just have a really expensive computer room.
[68:54.97]That's fine.
[69:00.69]Fifteen grand.

[69:28.76]Do that.
[69:29.74]No, don't stay!
[69:31.34]Come back!
[69:31.90]How do I get a loan?
[69:34.96]How do you get a loan?
[69:40.93]Why did I do this many computers?
[69:42.39]Like, what the fuck?
[69:46.59]I wasn't paying attention.
[69:47.45]I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[69:48.41]How do I get a loan?
[69:50.03]Oh, that doesn't look good.
[69:51.71]Alright.
[69:52.45]Marketing.
[69:53.35]Research.
[69:54.89]Finance.
[69:57.61]Okay.
[70:01.36]You must have at least $200 average profit over the last 10 days to take out a loan.
[70:04.78]I can't even take out a loan.
[70:05.84]They won't loan me any money.
[70:12.79]I couldn't go in there and prove... Yeah.
[70:16.95]The toilet, diaper, paper, bathroom store.
[70:21.44]That's not enough to convince us to give you a loan.
[70:25.62]Okay.
[70:28.27]I can work with this.
[70:31.59]You need to build doors to your stores.
[70:33.89]I know.
[70:35.13]I know, I know.
[70:35.67]I'm just trying to get this going.
[70:37.60]Double door here.
[70:38.96]Double door here.
[70:39.64]Actually, it's usually like that.
[70:42.70]Yeah.
[70:42.88]Okay.
[70:45.72]And then we're gonna get a door here.
[70:48.20]Double door.
[70:49.84]Double door.
[70:51.06]Double door.
[70:52.26]Double door.
[70:54.00]Staff door.
[70:55.68]These are 200 bucks each!
[70:58.47]What a joke!
[71:06.32]Okay, staff can go in there.
[71:10.71]Staff needs to be able to get in here too.
[71:18.19]Okay.
[71:18.53]2,700.
[71:18.55]2,400.
[71:18.57]I gotta start firing people.
[71:21.40]I'm burning money.
[71:22.60]Oh my god, I have $400.
[71:23.12]What happens if you lose?
[71:24.72]What happens if you don't have any money left?
[71:27.06]Do you go to jail?
[71:28.56]I don't know.
[71:33.73]I don't know.
[71:34.59]This is attempt number one.
[71:35.77]I didn't get it at first.
[71:39.31]Negative $1,700.
[71:41.21]What is costing so much money?
[71:42.83]Okay, I can fix it.
[71:44.94]I can fix it.
[71:45.34]I can fix it.
[71:45.72]Now let's just... We need to have shelves.
[71:46.96]Food shelf.
[71:47.56]Food shelf.
[71:49.56]Oh, I lose.
[72:10.82]What's this trash?
[72:14.94]Household goods.
[72:17.76]Wait a minute.
[72:20.42]I can't even make groceries.
[72:22.23]Why not?
[72:29.26]Tobacco, newspaper, road network, underground parking?
[72:35.48]Oh!
[72:37.88]I wanted to so badly have alcohol in night hours that I didn't do any food.
[72:42.39]Look at this!
[73:02.31]Saved!
[73:02.93]Alright, now I get it.
[73:06.11]I get it now.
[73:06.99]If we're gonna do this, don't worry.
[73:08.19]I get it now.
[73:11.89]Not night hours.
[73:12.95]We're doing cold chain.
[73:14.99]Fresh fruits, fresh vegetables.
[73:16.57]And this is gonna be a vegetable and fruit store.
[73:18.83]This is gonna be a farmer's market.
[73:20.79]It's not gonna be a bathroom store.
[73:23.16]Farmer's market.
[73:26.39]Farmer's market, okay.
[73:27.61]Let's make it a farmer's market.
[73:28.81]Sounds good.
[73:29.55]I need an office.
[73:31.05]While I have the money, I'm gonna fucking go for it.
[73:32.41]Let's go.
[73:35.41]Customer parking.
[73:36.19]No, staff parking.
[73:37.95]This is for the office.
[73:38.71]This is for the office complex.
[73:49.47]Yeah, you can't park there.
[73:50.61]Only the office workers can.
[73:52.97]Cheated on the game.
[73:53.99]How did I cheat?
[73:55.59]Look, I lost all my money and somebody bulldozed the bigger bathroom and then somebody else came in and took it over.
[74:03.27]And they said, well, this is fucking stupid.
[74:04.97]Why did you only have toilet paper?
[74:06.15]You're an idiot.
[74:07.21]Farmer's market.
[74:07.91]We're going to turn it into a farmer's market, I say.
[74:12.28]New management.
[74:12.80]I don't like that.
[74:19.88]I want it in the middle like this.
[74:24.33]10,000.
[74:25.39]Good.
[74:25.61]That's a good office.
[74:27.99]Fuck off with this shit.
[74:29.47]What?
[74:29.79]Me?
[74:29.93]What do I do?
[74:33.91]Fuck off with this shit.
[74:37.43]I don't know if you're talking about me.
[74:42.37]Is there doors?
[74:43.05]I didn't have them staff doors before.
[74:44.35]Okay.
[74:45.62]Computers.
[74:46.44]Office.
[74:49.54]We're gonna go hard right off the bat here.
[74:52.78]He's talking about me.
[74:58.82]Put it in emote only?
[75:00.84]Why?
[75:01.04]Okay.
[75:04.49]We're going to have a desk here.
[75:07.71]A desk here.
[75:08.55]And then one in the middle.
[75:16.60]One right here.
[75:18.10]There.
[75:18.58]We have three people that are just going to be working in here.
[75:23.51]I want that grocery store.
[75:24.91]We're going to make this a farmer's market before the mall, and I'm going to get it right this time.
[75:29.63]Okay, I have $164,000.
[75:30.61]That's plenty of money to do this shit.
[75:33.85]This game's cool.
[75:34.69]I like this game.
[75:36.59]This is kind of fun.
[75:37.27]Alright.
[75:38.61]Products for the shelf.
[75:41.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[75:42.18]Take this all off.
[75:44.18]How do I delete all this?
[75:45.86]I don't want this stuff.
[75:53.52]Manage store.
[75:55.42]Products.
[75:56.20]Okay, there we go.
[75:56.66]Get this all off.
[75:57.32]Remove this.
[75:59.56]Delete.
[76:03.08]Do I have to delete the shelf?
[76:05.72]Oh, it's in the storage already.
[76:08.91]Oh, fuck.
[76:13.43]Uh...
[76:16.93]Oh no, it's in the storage.
[76:18.99]Okay, well, here's the deal.
[76:21.19]Once I have access to fresh fruit, we're going to replace the tampons with apples.
[76:25.99]Alright, make this an office.
[76:39.92]Uh-huh.
[76:41.62]Manage.
[76:42.96]Office.
[76:43.30]Let's hire some staff.
[76:47.75]Uh, office?
[76:48.35]Good.
[76:48.55]I just have to hire all three of them.
[76:51.27]Wait.
[76:52.39]Yeah.
[76:57.30]Okay.
[76:57.76]There's three office workers.
[76:59.92]We're researching fresh fruit and vegetables.
[77:02.18]Somebody said my store was way too small.
[77:08.32]Alright, once this is done, we're gonna restock this shit.
[77:16.32]No, stop stocking this with tampons.

[77:23.24]Okay.
[77:23.98]I have... Are we doing our research?
[77:31.01]There we are.
[77:33.33]We're gonna get milk, fresh meat, fresh fruit, fresh cheeses.
[77:36.87]I can't wait.
[77:38.91]In the meantime, let's do a... Let's get that... No, let's not get that going.
[77:43.83]Not yet.
[77:44.05]Not yet.
[77:45.64]Superspeed this shit.
[77:50.50]I went way too fast last time.
[77:51.56]I tried to expand too quickly.
[77:56.76]Look at this.
[77:57.10]Good, good.
[77:57.40]Money, money, money.
[77:58.18]Roll it in.
[78:02.10]I need better items.
[78:03.06]Okay, set shelf.
[78:06.30]Trading card games.
[78:08.34]No.
[78:09.30]School supplies!
[78:10.24]It's gonna be school, right?
[78:14.76]Bedsheets.
[78:15.46]Cookware!
[78:20.89]Yep!
[78:22.13]Oh!
[78:28.29]Oh no, I think she's going for the tampons.
[78:30.30]Is that what it is?
[78:31.22]Yeah.
[78:33.34]What is back here?
[78:33.84]Why are there bags back here?
[78:35.06]What is this?
[78:36.48]Action figures.
[78:37.24]Get this shit out of here.
[78:39.62]Bedsheets.
[78:44.14]Toilet paper can stay.
[78:45.38]Bedsheets.
[78:46.50]Cookware.
[78:48.00]We have to put some more miscellaneous stuff up here.
[78:55.52]What are we doing on the research?
[78:56.38]6 out of 24.
[78:57.86]Okay.
[78:58.00]We're going to turn it sooner or later.
[79:00.30]It's going to be a farmer's market.
[79:01.86]You forgot to put the trash.
[79:03.18]Oh, shit.
[79:03.60]You're right.
[79:11.07]Okay.
[79:13.23]The customer, we're looking for some money here, looking for some profit.
[79:16.77]It's all about the profit you just threw shit on the ground.
[79:22.13]This store is disgusting.
[79:24.93]Alright, pick up an expensive handbag.
[79:30.64]What is it?
[79:32.04]It's a beetle!
[79:32.58]It's a bug!
[79:34.34]How expensive was that?
[79:35.18]What's going on?
[79:39.36]That was a $56 handbag!
[79:45.18]No wonder this shit was so inexpensive.
[79:46.78]Yeah, 10 bucks?
[79:47.46]That was 56 bucks.
[79:49.59]All these items in here are like 5 to 10 dollars.
[79:51.63]This one's like 80.
[79:55.35]Research.
[79:57.15]8 out of 24.
[79:57.65]Alright.
[79:58.11]Let me, um... Do I need to hire a janitor or something?
[80:08.79]Hire a stock.
[80:09.39]Hire a cashier.
[80:10.13]How do I... I mean, there's just trash everywhere.
[80:18.66]Nina Barber.
[80:20.00]Social ability.
[80:20.74]Who cares?
[80:21.28]Did that person pick the trash up off the ground?
[80:28.49]34%.
[80:28.59]Okay.
[80:31.47]10 man hours.
[80:32.19]34%.
[80:32.43]I don't have to look at that anymore.
[80:34.43]No debt.
[80:35.47]Profits not going great.
[80:36.55]Sales.
[80:36.83]Only 14 sales.
[80:38.22]How's that possible?
[80:38.94]Is trash cans inside?
[80:47.07]Have you ever been to like a Target before?
[80:48.99]Or like a Walmart?
[80:49.69]They're always outside.
[80:50.91]In front of the door.
[80:51.55]When's the last time you saw a trash can inside of a Target?
[80:57.27]They're like outside in the front of the door.
[81:08.60]There's both.
[81:09.58]Not here.
[81:10.08]That's too expensive.
[81:14.47]Somebody throw this trash away.
[81:18.16]Why would you want to shop in here?
[81:20.56]This is disgusting.
[81:21.62]Somebody clean that up!
[81:25.84]Why is nobody cleaning up the massive trash?
[81:28.16]Hire a janitor?
[81:31.16]I don't think there is janitors.
[81:37.85]Oh shit, there's a janitor.
[81:38.91]Okay, janitor.
[81:39.55]Alright, this is a chatter.
[81:42.83]Prince Crappy.
[81:46.41]Janitor?
[81:46.89]Pretty good janitor, Prince Rappy.
[81:50.03]Alright, go ahead.
[81:57.78]I made 500 bucks today.
[81:58.52]How much... How many salaries do I have?
[82:01.32]Too many salaries, dude.
[82:02.38]I can't do anything yet.
[82:06.60]I need another couple days to go by until I can do fresh fruit and vegetables.
[82:14.39]That's a fake viewer?
[82:15.09]No, it's not.
[82:15.71]He's here.
[82:23.27]Imagine being a janitor, LOL.
[82:24.55]What's wrong with that?
[82:26.63]It's a job!
[82:43.84]Ban that guy.
[82:46.20]Yeah, you know what?
[82:47.50]Ban that guy.
[82:48.74]Ban that guy for 10 minutes.
[82:56.39]Oof?
[82:58.73]Alright, where's the janitor?
[83:06.80]What's that?
[83:08.92]What is that?
[83:12.44]Wait, we have rats!
[83:15.30]Oh no, he just killed them.
[83:17.02]He just sprayed them with, like, rat acid.
[83:20.83]Where's the janitor?
[83:25.30]Okay, if you're like a building manager and you get the call.
[83:28.70]Hey, uh, we need you to deal with the rat problem.
[83:31.86]No.
[83:32.44]No, I don't have to do that.
[83:34.51]Uh, why are you calling me?
[83:36.63]Or... Janitor?
[83:41.83]Nope.
[83:46.79]You need an exterminator.
[83:50.64]Hi, Jerma.
[83:51.04]I'm a regional manager for Walmart, and all I really have to say is... What the fuck does it say?
[83:57.43]Jeremy, I'm a regional manager for Walmart and I really have to say to you is you're making a mockery of this business.
[84:01.93]Your store is a disaster and a liability.
[84:03.75]Someone's going to fall and crack their skull on the floor because you can't keep your shit clean.
[84:06.65]I've never seen a more poorly run store than this.
[84:08.78]I'd expect more from a short Bostonian streamer than what does short Bostonian have to do with anything?
[84:14.02]I could be a tall, giant Norwegian and I could still run a business bad if I was a short Bostonian guy.
[84:20.16]What are you talking about?
[84:30.50]Here we go.
[84:31.62]Janitor.
[84:33.40]Janitor.
[84:33.86]Where's the janitor?
[84:37.76]Good.
[84:38.30]Clean it up.
[84:56.11]Okay.
[84:56.33]Let's see if we can get somebody else.
[85:03.88]Welcome to work.
[85:11.08]You didn't even do anything.
[85:12.14]What about in here?
[85:13.38]Clean this shit up.
[85:15.56]What?
[85:18.85]You just pretended to work for five seconds.
[85:21.67]I need a dumpster?
[85:22.51]What do you mean a dumpster?
[85:31.73]Oh, wait a minute.
[85:32.19]Wait a minute.
[85:32.47]I actually think I need...
[85:34.98]Oh shit, hold on.
[85:37.46]I need a, uh, where is it?
[85:42.11]Garbage pickup.
[85:44.81]Fuck, okay, right here.
[85:45.83]Okay, now get in there and pick up that garbage and put it over here?
[85:56.14]But you don't actually put the garbage just on like a helipad.
[86:04.07]You do?
[86:05.23]Why?
[86:05.58]Why is there no trash?
[86:14.46]Why is there no dumpster?
[86:16.24]Okay, that's good.
[86:17.84]Good, now go back to- Everyone's on their phones.
[86:20.08]Everyone is on their phone, except for you.
[86:26.52]Okay, um, how are we doing on money?
[86:27.94]Toilet paper?
[86:32.50]Good choice!
[86:33.96]Good choice.
[86:35.78]That'll be $5.
[86:37.46]It costs $500 a day to run this business.
[86:41.27]Thank you.
[86:44.89]You know what?
[86:45.33]This would make sense if I had like a ton of different scratch tickets back here.
[86:51.61]Oh, the Charmin Ultra Soft.
[86:52.57]That's what I use too.
[86:54.85]Hey, you know, it's double the rolls in one roll.
[87:00.26]Saves money.
[87:00.84]Saves time.
[87:04.19]Research, 74%.
[87:09.01]These are your viewers, they're watching your stream.
[87:10.99]Oh yeah, I guess.
[87:15.54]28 beans.
[87:17.70]What is 28 beans getting?
[87:19.16]Everybody quick, everybody at them.
[87:22.16]Toilet paper!
[87:23.46]Toilet paper!
[87:44.08]You cannot convince me otherwise that that's not a Koopa Kid with like a human mask on.
[87:58.20]Cut his mic.
[87:58.79]Let me cut my mic.
[88:08.45]You are using view bots.
[88:10.73]Oh, Megalel.
[88:11.37]What am I, 8900 Andy?
[88:14.04]I want to refresh, but I don't want to break it.
[88:16.62]9k Andy?
[88:18.50]Okay, I got a question for all you Twitch viewers.
[88:21.05]At what point, at what viewer count, are you no longer a Andy?
[88:26.31]What number is it?
[88:26.91]Is it 20?
[88:27.15]10?
[88:27.17]It's 20.
[88:27.67]That seems way too high.
[88:39.27]20k is, if you're under 20k, you are like 1999k Andy.
[88:50.57]10k.
[88:52.35]What?
[88:52.67]That's so many people.
[88:55.29]Oh, sea lion?
[88:56.73]Everybody out of the champion!
[89:01.37]Okay, I have to play the fucking game, man.
[89:08.77]Research, hurry!
[89:09.61]So I can actually make money.
[89:17.54]Finish it!

[89:37.41]Frozen food?
[89:38.39]Oh yeah.
[89:38.87]Ice cream.
[89:39.51]Frozen pizzas.
[89:40.21]Vegetables.

[89:47.33]Here we go.
[89:47.73]Grocery store.
[89:50.91]Health and beauty.
[89:52.45]Where is it?
[89:52.77]Toys and games.
[89:54.94]Health and beauty.
[89:55.46]Where is it?
[89:59.06]Oh, this is not food shelves.
[90:00.24]Okay, get rid of this shit.
[90:01.78]Pause it.
[90:04.00]Alright, delete all this.
[90:06.41]Delete everything.
[90:06.97]Get rid of everything.
[90:10.47]Okay.

[90:14.23]Okay.
[90:17.84]Delete.
[90:20.22]Delete it.
[90:22.00]Why can I not delete it?
[90:24.38]Delete.
[90:24.72]Delete.
[90:25.08]Delete.
[90:25.34]Delete.
[90:25.58]Delete.

[90:26.58]Delete it all.
[90:30.88]Okay.
[90:32.02]Go.
[90:32.60]Remove.
[90:35.72]Food.
[90:38.17]We need food shelves, it's time to start making money.
[90:42.59]Fast food dispenser.
[90:44.76]Ooh, okay, here we go.
[90:47.12]Finally.
[90:49.36]This is gonna be like apples, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, mustard, onion.
[90:57.55]Here's my fries.
[90:58.27]Hey, you know what I was thinking?
[90:59.01]You know how they're doing, you know, they have the Travis Scott meal.
[91:02.59]They have the, uh, there's a new one now too, right?
[91:05.83]What's the new one?
[91:06.85]Jay, there's a new McDonald's, like, celebrity meal.
[91:12.58]And I'm like, okay, they're actually, this is becoming a thing now.
[91:15.34]They're doing this.
[91:16.50]And I thought about, like, what would my meal be?
[91:19.40]Right?
[91:19.60]Not Jay Leno.
[91:21.63]No.
[91:23.77]It's like, oh yeah, my meal is a Big Mac and an Oreo McFlurry.
[91:28.91]Right.
[91:30.02]But when I go to McDonald's, I order like eight things off the menu.
[91:37.58]I'm disgusting.
[91:38.98]I don't order one thing.
[91:39.97]So it's not like, oh hey, the Jerma985.
[91:44.79]It's a McChicken meal with Coke.
[91:47.81]No, no, it's a number one, two McChickens, a 10-piece nugget, and a McDouble.
[91:55.18]Like, and I eat it till my stomach hurts.
[91:58.80]How would they do that?
[92:00.16]Do you order just one thing on the menu?
[92:04.36]You guys don't, am I crazy?
[92:07.29]So when you guys go to McDonald's and you get, like, the number one with fries and a Coke, that's it, that's what you eat.
[92:13.39]You don't get, like, two other McChickens on top of that.
[92:20.10]Hey, it's me, Jerma985.
[92:22.47]Here's my meal.
[92:23.97]I get a number one, hold the pickles.
[92:26.33]Okay, and a Powerade.
[92:28.33]Cool.
[92:29.27]Hold on a second, though.
[92:30.71]Two McChickens with extra mayo on them.
[92:33.02]Yeah, getting a little weird here.
[92:34.96]And my ten-piece nuggets in sweet and sour sauce.
[92:38.54]Don't forget the apple pie.
[92:40.96]Ba-da-ba-ba-ba.
[92:42.79]Your fucking stomach's gonna hurt.
[92:49.93]Alright, that's enough food.
[92:53.99]That's a 5,000 cal- I don't order just one meal at McDonald's.
[92:56.43]I just go hard.
[92:57.45]That's what I do.
[92:58.57]No drink?
[92:59.03]I said Powerade.
[93:01.65]Holy shit, here's another thing that I- I didn't even know this either.
[93:03.99]Listen to this.
[93:05.53]Did you- I might be just new to this and maybe I didn't even care to think about it.
[93:08.50]I don't know why.
[93:09.90]Any size drink at McDonald's is a dollar.
[93:14.43]A large, like 24, 30 ounce fucking drink at McDonald's is a dollar.
[93:19.31]It's one dollar.
[93:21.89]If you get a Powerade, listen to me.
[93:23.99]If you get a Powerade at McDonald's, that's like 24 ounces and it's a dollar.
[93:29.16]If you go to the gas station right next to McDonald's, a 32 ounce Powerade is like three bucks.
[93:38.18]What?
[93:38.84]What?
[93:44.23]Stop with the ad.
[93:45.35]This is not an ad.
[93:46.09]This is real life.
[93:48.47]It's a dollar for any drink at McDonald's.
[93:51.27]I love this place.
[93:52.21]You guys know that.
[93:52.97]How is this an ad?
[93:53.71]This is my life.
[93:56.66]Make sure you get the Jerma N85 next time.
[94:04.44]That's what the ad says.
[94:06.80]Why would anybody ever sponsor this stream?
[94:09.88]You watch 10 minutes of this stream and you'll leave.
[94:12.72]If you are in a business, like a corporate business, and you are like, oh, this guy's a 9k Andy.
[94:18.15]Let's see what he's doing.
[94:19.73]Nope.
[94:20.59]Don't like it.
[94:23.37]Show me the rest of the 8k Andys that are on Twitch right now.
[94:32.99]No, okay.
[94:33.69]Checkout.

[99:49.38]Much better.
[99:51.88]This is a cuck house.
[99:55.06]I don't know what that means.
[99:56.10]I'm gonna just assume that you all know what that means.
[99:58.20]I don't know what that means.
[100:00.76]I'm too old to know what that is.
[100:03.07]I don't know.
[100:07.81]Alright, fridge.
[100:08.57]I'm gonna need like milk and shit.
[100:13.80]Milk.
[100:15.86]Alright.
[100:16.52]Perfect.
[100:17.30]This is perfect.
[100:20.61]Plenty of room for people to walk around and be like, oh, hey, Julie, yeah, we live, we live like straight from each other.
[100:29.52]Somebody just to drop.
[100:31.56]You know what really would fucking pissed me off?
[100:34.62]More than anything, whenever I'd go to the grocery store, is you would just walk down an aisle somewhere and there would just be a shattered salsa glass and salsa all over the ground.
[100:44.05]Did that happen to you guys at the grocery store ever?
[100:48.11]Like, somebody would literally just drop and shatter a glass salsa.
[100:53.97]Like, come on.
[100:55.65]And nobody can go down that aisle.
[100:57.77]If you want salsa, like, what, are you gonna walk around it?
[101:00.61]What if you step in it?
[101:03.49]Or juice, yeah, like an orange juice is just... How does that even happen?
[101:08.35]Most orange juices are sealed.
[101:11.49]How does a full fucking orange juice, like, hit the ground and explode and go over five aisles?
[101:16.13]That doesn't make any sense.
[101:18.46]You're living in a 2007 comedy movie.
[101:22.86]Ban that guy for literally a year.
[101:24.84]I don't want to see their name again for a full year.
[101:35.91]Crack street.
[101:37.61]What was I doing?
[101:38.75]Oh yeah, meat and cheese.

[102:18.42]And then we're gonna have dairy?
[102:19.36]Isn't that the same thing?
[102:21.56]There's fresh meat and then fresh fish is back here.
[102:27.23]Okay.
[102:27.91]So we've got fresh meat, fresh fish, fresh milk, and fresh dairy.
[102:32.37]There's Twitch staff in the chat.
[102:35.32]Twitch staff is here.
[102:36.26]Ban that guy for a fucking year.
[102:38.26]Ban the Twitch chat for like at least a month.
[102:46.95]Can you even do that?
[102:48.37]Is that even possible?
[102:55.05]I feel like they can just right-click their name and go, no, I don't think so, sir.
[102:58.45]Here we go.
[102:59.89]Finally.
[103:00.43]I actually finally am going to be able to make some money.

[103:18.21]What's wrong with the town you grew up in?
[103:20.41]First, the violating snowmen with their noses displaced.
[103:23.93]Now grocery store aisles that are a mess.
[103:27.55]I don't think that's so out of the ordinary to have like a... Okay, hold on.
[103:30.93]So, a snowman with the carrot for like his dick.
[103:35.87]And having like broken salsa bottles in sometimes in the grocery store.
[103:40.11]I feel like that's like not that big of a deal.
[103:43.13]That's...
[103:44.81]That's not, like, bad.
[103:46.03]I can't believe you grew up there.
[103:49.39]Somebody put a carrot on a snowman's dick.
[103:54.07]Not in my neighborhood.
[103:58.49]Let the workers unionize.
[103:59.64]I don't think I can even do that.
[104:01.76]Missed sales opportunities.
[104:03.46]Customers can't access the center because there are no spots.
[104:05.76]Okay.
[104:19.93]Okay.
[104:22.54]Parking, parking, parking.
[104:23.62]There's so much demand right now.

[105:31.50]Filthy acts.
[105:35.58]I think I might need another cashier.
[105:37.16]This business is really booming.
[105:43.01]We got a line at the checkout.
[105:44.61]This has never happened before.
[105:47.92]This person's buying fish.
[105:49.16]How much is fish?
[105:50.30]Probably wicked expensive.
[105:51.18]18 bucks.
[105:59.10]I need another cashier.
[106:02.22]We'll do it at close.
[106:03.12]I'll make two lines.
[106:10.68]Cashier's too slow.
[106:12.35]Yeah, he is pretty slow, isn't he?
[106:17.09]That's why he's going so slow.
[106:18.35]He just doesn't care.
[106:21.43]He's doing the rotation sleeve really slowly.

[106:26.95]What are you doing?
[106:28.57]Hurry up!
[106:29.09]Alright, he's fine.
[106:34.50]Speed determines the walking speed of all characters.
[106:38.62]So he's wicked fast, but he's really slow.
[106:43.72]This person can explode!
[106:44.68]This person can explode!

[107:11.90]I need more space.
[107:14.66]No one's even using the fucking bathroom.
[107:17.84]So, I'm gonna get rid of it.
[107:20.06]What's the point of having this bathroom?
[107:21.28]No one's using it.
[107:32.11]We'll make it smaller.
[107:35.59]Make the bathroom smaller.
[107:36.57]Then we have room for the checkout.
[107:45.69]Make it two by two.
[107:46.61]Yeah, it's going to be tiny.
[107:47.41]There's going to be room over here for a checkout counter.
[107:51.67]Wait, stop!
[107:55.95]There.
[107:56.57]Okay.
[108:00.47]Now we're going to build foundation.
[108:05.86]Okay, wall.

[108:48.48]Don't use these yet.
[108:49.32]Okay.
[108:55.56]Now let's have a checkout counter.
[108:56.86]Shit, I gotta... Alright, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[109:02.00]I need to move that.
[109:03.84]This needs to move.

[110:18.55]I don't think, there can't be a bathroom here.
[110:20.85]There's not going to be a bathroom.
[110:25.03]There's not enough space.
[110:28.17]Wait, I guess there technically is.
[110:31.95]I think there is technically enough space.
[110:33.63]If I put this over here.
[110:35.75]Then the cashier can stand here.
[110:41.29]Oh, fuck it.
[110:41.77]Let's just go.
[110:42.19]Let's build it a little bit further up.

[111:53.55]Okay, we're ready.
[111:54.19]Now I can have a second cashier.
[111:55.77]We're running into this problem again.
[111:56.75]What are we doing on profit?
[111:59.23]I mean, I made almost double the amount of money.
[112:04.10]Fix that wall.
[112:05.12]Alright, hold on.
[112:12.02]I'm on it.
[112:12.34]I'm working on it.
[112:24.58]Okay, hold on, I'm working on it.

[112:55.37]There's no foundation?
[112:57.03]How?
[113:02.07]It's just grass?
[113:03.22]Not anymore.

[113:06.74]There we go.
[113:07.66]We're done.
[113:12.90]There.
[113:13.08]That's much cleaner.
[113:15.22]Isn't it?
[113:17.00]There we go.
[113:18.02]Now let's get a cashier here.
[113:19.25]Manage essentials.
[113:21.31]We need another cashier.
[113:25.64]How about Paul Resley?
[113:30.32]Prince Raffi's better.
[113:31.24]Yeah, that person's here.
[113:38.50]Of course they're here.
[113:39.10]Dude, look at this chart.
[113:42.72]This chart is so much better than this one.
[113:46.02]Well, we may have found a bottom there, I think, everybody.
[113:52.43]We found a bottom.
[113:55.81]It's been two hours and this, okay.
[113:58.03]I'm zoomed in right now and people are like, oh wow, he's probably working on like one of his buildings.
[114:01.33]It's probably a shit.
[114:01.87]It's been two hours.
[114:10.00]I'm perfecting it.
[114:12.98]Okay.
[114:13.22]Oh, he must be really stretching this shit for content.
[114:17.72]Oh dude.
[114:18.62]Holy shit.

[114:31.29]Right here.
[114:36.61]We can have, you know, hold on a minute.
[114:37.84]It doesn't have to be all food.
[114:39.18]It doesn't have to be all food.
[114:44.46]Where does it say it has to be all food?
[114:46.28]We can have like a toilet paper rack.
[114:49.32]Alright, that's fine.
[114:52.09]Tools.
[114:52.43]How about car tools?
[114:57.12]Should we put toilet paper?
[114:58.42]Diapers?
[114:59.46]Right here.
[115:01.20]That's not a bad idea.

[119:03.69]Only six more hours remain until I can do a frozen department.
[119:06.71]That's 10,000.
[119:07.42]Make 100 total sales.
[119:08.66]That's $10,000.
[119:09.20]I'll take it.
[119:09.70]Thank you.
[119:10.04]Plenty of parking.
[119:19.63]Good traffic route.
[119:20.93]People getting in and out.
[119:21.81]Having to cross.
[119:23.25]No crosswalk.
[119:27.23]See how many people get hit.
[119:31.58]That guy's life just flashed before his eyes.
[119:36.22]We're already at the peak for yesterday.
[119:37.70]We got like six more hours left.
[119:44.88]Nice.
[119:45.98]Keep it going.
[119:46.56]Keep rolling in the money.
[119:53.30]The double queue line was a big deal.
[119:56.50]Look for viewers.
[119:59.04]What do we got here?
[120:05.87]Gabe.
[120:07.43]Cheryl.
[120:09.97]Cram123.
[120:10.09]I wish I could hire some of these people.
[120:21.93]86%.
[120:21.99]And then, okay, this is fresh food.
[120:24.03]We're going to have a little aisle over this way to be frozen food.
[120:27.75]And we'll do some reorganizing.
[120:28.83]Remember, there has not been a single viewer.
[120:34.58]Are you trying to tell me that 00trashman is not a viewer of this channel?
[120:44.16]So where are they getting this person from?
[120:50.70]Can we refresh again, please?
[120:52.20]Ooh, woo.
[120:54.16]I mean, it's gonna fuck up.
[120:57.60]He's gone.
[120:58.20]Well, we'll find out.
[121:00.06]Someone will link him.
[121:01.80]Dude, you were a huge part of the stream.
[121:05.76]Everybody was fucking talking about you, man.
[121:09.40]Alright, that's a pretty good day.
[121:10.50]That's a really good day.
[121:11.64]Almost a thousand bucks.
[121:13.56]Net profit's still not very good, but we'll get there.
[121:15.44]98%.
[121:16.62]Frozen food is done.
[121:21.11]You are not researching any project.
[121:22.41]Okay, frozen food.
[121:24.61]Hmm, restaurants.
[121:26.13]Big data.
[121:28.21]Alcohol.
[121:29.51]Restaurants.
[121:32.55]Sales.
[121:33.33]Monitoring.
[121:36.63]Security.
[121:37.91]Cleaning technology.
[121:39.79]Bowling alley.
[121:40.65]Cinema.
[121:41.79]Fitness center.
[121:44.45]I kind of want, like, have restaurant in the back.
[121:47.72]Okay, you know how Walmart has, like, a- usually has- No, what- who- Target.
[121:53.07]Target has, like, Starbucks in it.
[121:55.79]In a bunch of- in a bunch of locations.
[121:58.01]Don't they?
[121:58.33]Okay, so, why can't we have a restaurant, or like a- like a- like a Puppagino's or something in the back?
[122:11.13]Let's have a bowling alley in the back of the grocery store.
[122:15.46]That's gonna take- I don't have the manpower for that.
[122:20.60]I could do bar too.
[122:24.42]Anyone here have Twitch?
[122:25.98]I think everyone.
[122:28.46]Do an arcade?
[122:29.24]Let me do alcohol first because that'll sell a ton.
[122:36.53]Imagine not having alcohol here.
[122:38.73]That's a huge sale.
[122:43.64]Okay.
[122:44.64]I just unlocked frozen food.
[122:45.96]Let's continue our grocery store.
[122:47.56]What do you think?
[122:48.95]This way?
[122:50.97]This way for frozen?
[122:53.03]Or this way for frozen?
[122:54.03]No, get rid of the bathroom.
[122:55.51]Bathroom demolition time.
[122:57.31]Nobody cares.
[122:57.79]Nobody uses it.
[122:58.61]Is it like how many times a urinal has been used?
[123:02.77]Does it say used how many times?
[123:08.89]Zero.
[123:10.87]Delete it.
[123:12.58]This is our frozen food section.
[123:15.24]Get rid of this shit.
[123:17.52]It's blocking the door.
[123:18.58]Yeah, we'll get rid of this shit.
[123:20.66]I don't want it.
[123:25.01]Take out this, too.
[123:28.15]We're getting in the way of our frozen section.
[123:34.15]Okay.
[123:38.75]Cool.
[123:39.19]So then people can walk over here.
[123:43.49]And then this will go... I like that so far.
[123:46.51]This can go... Bang, bang, bang.
[123:50.56]We got the money.
[123:51.02]We got $158,000.
[123:51.26]We're going to go bang, bang, bang.
[123:56.96]Go for it.
[123:58.92]Foundation.
[123:59.38]Like that.
[124:03.51]That's a big investment.
[124:05.19]That's a huge investment, but I'm willing to do it.
[124:14.79]Jerma, dot, dot, dot, Jerma.
[124:21.93]Don't make this a restroom so people don't piss on the floor.
[124:24.03]Alright, the type of customer that if they walked into a grocery store, and a five by five cubic feet area with a sign that says, this is a bathroom, pointing down,
[124:39.78]I don't think that person... I... No, who's going to do that?
[124:43.36]Who's going to just pee where that sign says?
[124:45.00]I mean, that's kind of funny.
[124:59.23]So delete an active zone.
[125:00.49]Yeah.
[125:00.79]There's no staff.
[125:03.37]No, not store two.
[125:04.35]Fuck off.
[125:05.73]No!
[125:06.43]Stop doing that.
[125:07.61]I want this to be essentials.
[125:15.75]Don't do that!
[125:17.47]No!
[125:18.24]Why is it doing this?
[125:22.52]If your selection overlaps an existing zone of the same type, the zone will be extended.
[125:33.10]What the fuck?
[125:36.86]Okay.
[125:39.12]Let's do, uh, we got frozen food.
[125:43.82]Ladies and gentlemen, we got frozen food.
[125:49.59]Frozen.
[125:50.05]Excuse me?
[125:52.23]Freezer?
[125:53.15]Excuse me.
[125:54.89]Where is it?
[126:01.39]Wait, you put frozen shit into a refrigerator?
[126:04.43]Okay.
[126:08.46]I'm just gonna put more of these.
[126:16.14]Okay, that's a lot of them.
[126:17.64]I don't want that many.
[126:22.69]Alright, fuck.
[126:26.24]I want to do... There's going to be something weird here.
[126:28.50]Like a couple of vending machines.
[126:29.68]Like a pool table.
[126:30.96]I don't know.
[126:33.90]Put them next to each other.
[126:34.82]Okay.
[126:47.59]Nice.
[126:48.27]And then we can go wham.
[126:51.29]Shelf.
[127:00.43]That works.
[127:01.31]The person just needs to stand right here.
[127:02.69]He can fit.
[127:05.45]Have you ever actually been to a grocery store?
[127:09.01]No.
[127:09.87]No, never.
[127:10.77]I call someone.
[127:13.35]Say, hey, um, can you get me two packs of Totino's pizza rolls?
[127:23.30]Three cans of corned beef hash.
[127:25.96]Two gallons of milk.
[127:28.65]Two full onions and eight pounds of hamburger meat.
[127:33.87]Thanks.
[127:40.78]Full onions.
[127:41.38]Yeah.
[127:41.70]Like the big ones.
[127:43.94]Okay.
[127:44.10]These are freezers.
[127:46.58]Ground beef.
[127:47.10]It's called ground beef.
[127:47.98]It's called ground beef.
[127:51.00]Alright.
[127:51.34]Frozen vegetables.
[127:53.66]Frozen vegetables.
[127:55.74]Two in a row.
[127:57.12]And I'm going to do frozen pizzas.
[128:00.69]Frozen... Pizzas?
[128:06.20]Oh, on this side.
[128:06.92]Ice cream.
[128:10.78]Ice cream, ice cream.
[128:13.72]And then... Frozen vegetables.
[128:17.76]Ice cream.
[128:20.04]A whole row of ice cream.
[128:22.02]I love when you go to the giant ice cream row.
[128:25.96]And this is a fridge.
[128:27.46]Uh, what's back here?
[128:28.20]We'll do, uh... Fucking...
[128:33.05]Meat?
[128:33.37]What's back here already?
[128:34.07]What's here?
[128:34.49]Is that fish?
[128:35.84]That's fish, fish.
[128:39.20]Let's put juice in here.
[128:40.38]Juices.
[128:42.12]And soda.
[128:43.84]Okay.
[128:45.48]And then over here we're gonna do... Oh, right, the checkout counter.
[128:49.89]What am I, stupid?
[128:50.71]Snacks.
[128:54.13]And cookies.
[128:54.85]Looks good to me.
[129:02.30]I'm going to explode.
[129:05.28]You mean this wall?
[129:10.32]There you go.
[129:10.94]Settle down.
[129:13.39]Our mall empire is expanding.
[129:17.43]Actually, just a grocery store.
[129:22.33]Research night.
[129:23.07]What are we researching now?
[129:25.85]Oh, alcohol.
[129:26.29]No, I want alcohol.
[129:30.40]I want to be able to have like an alcohol station over here.
[129:34.36]And then I'm going to have to redo this.
[129:36.57]Once I get alcohol over here, I'm going to expand this out and we're going to have like four checkout counters.
[129:41.59]Where's the mall?
[129:43.31]I'm working on it.
[129:46.15]Bathroom, for fuck's sake.
[129:47.22]No one's going to use the bathroom in here.
[129:52.28]You want me to make a bathroom for the one person every five hours that actually uses the bathroom in the grocery store?
[130:02.24]Yes.
[130:03.10]No.
[130:06.49]The employees need one.
[130:23.61]Jeff Bezos streamer.
[130:24.83]Jeff Bezos didn't have like a frozen food vegetable grocery store service.
[130:32.69]I mean, he does now.
[130:35.95]But he didn't, that's not how he started.
[130:37.39]He started selling, like, books.
[130:39.63]He had a bookstore online.
[130:40.94]How the fuck did that happen?
[130:42.74]Can we go over that real quick?
[130:45.14]How did... I have a bookstore turn into I own the entire fucking globe.
[130:52.68]All shipping, all services, and all products.
[130:59.11]How did that happen?
[131:05.61]People really liked books.
[131:07.11]Yeah.
[131:11.19]You guys ever feel like it was a scenario where he was selling books and like, somebody just said, hey, uh, what if you delivered something else that wasn't books?
[131:23.60]Like pens?
[131:25.62]What are you talking about, Dave?
[131:27.38]Yeah, what if instead of books, what if you did like pens and pencils and paperclips and stuff?
[131:31.50]Like office supplies.
[131:33.60]Dave, that's fucking stupid.
[131:35.50]Get the fuck out of my garage, or wherever I started this business.
[131:41.06]You guys think Dave ever got, like, any royalties for that?
[131:48.75]And then, like, one day, Jeff Bezos was sitting there, he's like, you know, goddammit, I don't have a pen on me.
[131:54.23]Where am I gonna get, like, a stack of bunch of pens?
[131:55.87]Am I gonna go to the office store?
[131:57.77]Wait, oh, ding!
[132:00.74]I'll just get it on Amazon.
[132:02.06]I'll make it like pens and books.
[132:04.52]And whiteboards and office supplies.
[132:07.12]And then he like set it up and then he ordered the pens and he said how easy that was.
[132:12.99]Why is Jeff Bezos a surfer?
[132:16.47]Is he from California?
[132:19.03]Everybody that made a business apparently was from California.
[132:26.29]No, he's not.
[132:26.77]Where's he from?
[132:27.97]He's from hell.
[132:28.68]Oh.
[132:32.61]Not from hell.
[132:33.41]He's from like Ohio.
[132:35.47]Dude, look at this money.
[132:41.18]That's what we call, hopefully not a dead cat bounce.
[132:49.76]People are getting word, man.
[132:50.84]Wait, back to school.
[132:52.50]Hold on a second here.
[132:53.70]School supplies, pens, T-shirts, and laptop computers.
[132:58.66]This is Jeff Bezos way.
[133:00.02]I gotta get pens.
[133:00.90]I gotta get pens and paper and school supplies and pencils.
[133:04.51]Alright, we're gonna move the- I'm gonna make a pens, paper, school supplies office building over here.
[133:09.63]I got $150,000.
[133:11.95]Ohio is a fine place.
[133:13.01]I've never been to Ohio.
[133:16.31]I'll be honest, I've never had a reason to ever go there.
[133:19.19]It's kind of just a place.
[133:22.53]I don't have a reason to be there.
[133:23.75]I don't have any family there.
[133:24.95]I don't want to go there.
[133:28.01]How much do we make?
[133:28.48]A thousand bucks?
[133:29.88]Alright, cool.
[133:32.16]I have enough money.
[133:32.66]I think we're going to make a second store over here.
[133:35.60]Just a small one.
[133:36.26]Just for school supplies.
[133:37.16]Wait.
[133:37.76]Research team.
[133:39.78]Research team, what are you doing?
[133:41.56]Shit.
[133:42.36]Where's school supplies?
[133:44.96]Logistics?
[133:45.50]No.
[133:47.21]Bowling, cinema, fitness, chemicals, clothing.
[133:53.83]Shit.
[133:57.33]Men's underwear, okay.
[133:59.29]Media.
[134:02.16]Backo.
[134:04.74]E-cigarettes.
[134:07.76]We need clothing store.
[134:10.18]No, no.
[134:11.30]How much time do I have?
[134:11.98]I don't have enough time.
[134:12.64]When does the back to school start?
[134:15.14]Starts in one day?
[134:16.48]One day?
[134:18.68]I can't build that in one day.
[134:19.98]I can't.
[134:24.82]I don't have enough workers that will do that.
[134:28.84]Back to school vapes.
[134:33.25]Just fill your grocery store with school supplies.
[134:35.09]I can't even do it.
[134:43.39]Wait, hold on.
[134:45.33]Head sheets.
[134:46.41]Light bulbs.
[134:47.07]Ha ha ha.
[134:50.98]Reading cards?
[134:51.90]I'm doing like the Jim Carrey.
[135:06.23]I'm sorry.
[135:07.35]Running out of parking?
[135:10.26]I need more parking.
[135:21.50]Shit.
[135:22.54]More parking.
[135:25.28]This is alright.
[135:25.74]I'm gonna have a store over here anyways.
[135:34.82]Hurry up.
[135:36.09]Hurry the fuck up.
[135:39.09]Sorry.
[135:40.21]I'm serious.
[135:43.67]Mr. Green's business center.
[135:49.37]Alright, now we need to make a...
[135:52.73]Alright, we'll have a section over here.
[135:54.35]We're going to continue to build this out.
[135:55.95]School supplies are going to be up here.
[135:57.43]We want a ton of traffic because we only have two queues.
[136:01.59]So we want people to really travel to get all this in-demand shit.
[136:07.58]Okay, foundation.
[136:08.44]Let's go.
[136:12.68]I got money.
[136:14.76]Settle down.
[136:15.36]Relax.
[136:15.70]I got money.
[136:28.91]Small is too small.
[136:32.49]Yeah, we talked about Amazon.
[136:36.82]Amazon was a computer in a garage.
[136:40.56]You have to start small.
[136:41.56]You can't just... You know what?
[136:43.26]I'm gonna make a mall today and it's gonna have 400 stores and I'm gonna own all property.
[136:47.98]That's false.
[136:54.21]That's a lie.
[136:55.13]Wait, is that just like a... Is that like propaganda?
[136:59.84]Is that like straight up like, you know, he started with a computer in his garage with just him and his swollen, like charcoal covered, like dirt hands.
[137:10.37]That didn't happen?
[137:12.79]Amazon started in, it was trust fund money.
[137:17.57]Well, but his parents had a lot of money.
[137:20.32]Well, what do you want?
[137:23.92]His parents were rich, whatever.
[137:27.51]He still used his bare hands to build the computer and then he built the warehouses with his hands.
[137:35.48]He used his bare hands to do Amazon.
[137:46.44]This is propaganda.
[137:48.27]Why is this propaganda?
[137:49.81]This is called I'm not informed correctly.
[137:59.40]This guy's a bootlicker.
[138:00.92]What?
[138:01.22]Hold on, let me just pop this huge zit that's on my grocery store.
[138:06.91]Hold on a minute.
[138:14.68]He's, oh, he's a communist.
[138:20.88]Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[138:30.13]He's shilling for Amazon Prime.
[138:32.41]No, if I was shilling for Amazon Prime, I'd say, hey guys, you know, there's a button underneath your computer there.
[138:39.40]And on the window, if you click it, you'll get, you know, if you have Amazon Prime, all of us do.
[138:44.56]Go ahead and use that.
[138:45.90]You know, you don't have to use it on me, but use it on me if you can.
[138:48.76]But if you don't use it on somebody, use your Amazon Prime on me.
[138:51.42]Not on me, but on somebody else.
[138:52.80]On me, though.
[138:57.36]You're a sellout.
[139:00.76]See?
[139:01.08]It worked.
[139:02.50]I just have to say the words Amazon Prime.
[139:03.94]Guys, it worked.
[139:05.60]I didn't even do anything.
[139:06.76]I just said the words Amazon Prime and somebody gave five community subs.
[139:09.68]I didn't do anything.
[139:10.34]I just said those words.
[139:11.94]There's like an immediate triggering response to just, I heard the word Amazon Prime, five subs.
[139:21.31]I gave you money, hee hee.
[139:24.63]He's an influencer.
[139:25.69]Alright, how about this?
[139:26.35]Let me influence you this way.
[139:29.08]Have a latte.
[139:31.10]Go have a latte and spend the $5 on a latte.
[139:34.26]And then every $5 you were thinking about giving me, put it into like a little fund.

[149:35.75]What is that bullshit?
[149:40.35]It's just spicy McChickens.
[149:45.01]And the spicy chicken shit at fast food restaurants is gross.
[149:49.84]Go ahead and you can go ahead and at me, right?
[149:51.96]Like the people say, like the kids say these days.
[149:57.13]It's all the spicy chicken sandwiches at all these fast food restaurants.
[150:00.47]It's just like kind of hurts the back of your nose.
[150:02.95]It's just like a back of your nose, like weird spice flavor.
[150:09.70]It's just like powdered spicy.
[150:11.32]You know what I mean?
[150:12.08]It's a powder.
[150:12.66]It definitely feels like granular spicy powder.
[150:18.56]Where's my regular McChicken?
[150:23.74]I like spicy shit, but I don't like the powder spice.
[150:28.07]It's like a dusting that they put on it.
[150:29.81]And it's orange.
[150:33.41]True, but the regular one sucks.
[150:34.85]What?

[151:06.34]I look over and I read something.
[151:07.84]You know how hard it is to read this shit?
[151:11.99]Sometimes it's just the first thing that happens.
[151:13.65]I just see it.
[151:14.45]He's 10k Andy, that's fine.
[151:19.25]I can pull out stuff pretty well, but sometimes it's eat a mick dick.
[151:24.87]I'm sorry.

[152:02.41]9.4k, Andy.
[152:03.01]That's, like, so funny to me.
[152:04.17]Look at the fuck.
[152:06.17]Alright, what should I research?
[152:06.97]I got alcohol now, right?
[152:08.41]Should we research a bar?
[152:09.82]Yes, we should.
[152:10.66]Is that even a question?

[154:44.59]I want to... Why am I trapped?
[154:55.50]Remove this road.
[154:57.54]Going up here.
[155:06.28]Yup.
[155:08.94]Perfect!
[155:21.09]Takes a long time to do this, but it's okay.
[155:23.41]We can have more parking here, and I'm going to have an exit here, too.
[155:25.43]Do you remember the roof?
[155:32.83]I can't.
[155:33.13]There's no roof.
[155:34.05]This is a top-down game.
[155:36.21]I am the roof.
[155:41.15]Okay, let's get some parking spaces.
[156:02.66]It is the CEO's parking lot.

[156:19.21]Why not?
[156:20.80]Fix the roof.
[156:21.44]There's nothing wrong with the roof.
[156:22.80]There is no roof.
[156:28.12]There's no roof.
[156:28.76]There's no such thing as a roof.
[156:29.58]What are you talking about?
[156:33.31]Alright, this is a fuck.
[156:35.17]Save the game before I make any other dumb mistakes.
[156:36.97]I have 100 grand left.
[156:38.92]Ugh.
[156:44.94]Add a roof and we're gonna leave.
[156:45.88]I don't have a roof.
[156:51.14]I hate this that I had to do this and I spent money on this.
[156:55.99]It'll go up somewhere to another store.
[156:57.77]Somewhere up here.
[156:58.43]Okay.
[156:59.21]It'll go up to another store.

[160:45.45]Nine dollars in the green.
[160:53.68]Yeah, Robert Irvin came in.
[160:59.81]Tear down this wall.
[161:01.11]This wall doesn't need to be there.
[161:04.37]Open it up, you need school supplies back here.
[161:07.65]I'm fucking huge.
[161:13.42]Yes, yes, yes, Robert Irvin, you're huge.
[161:15.88]I know, I'm huge.
[161:20.73]That was a bad accent.
[161:22.53]What?
[161:22.71]I haven't seen the show in like five years.
[161:29.08]And look.
[161:30.26]Last month, you turned a nine dollar profit.
[161:34.62]I did my work here.
[161:37.15]Flex into the camera like he always does.
[161:43.69]Why doesn't he... Okay, I got a question for you.
[161:46.25]Robert Irvin's fucking huge, right?
[161:48.43]Don't you think you'd want to make that part of like a shtick in the show?
[161:52.33]Like when he hangs something up on a wall and he's like, move this couch over this way.
[161:56.87]And then just BAM!
[161:58.11]Just huge flex into the camera.
[161:59.97]That would be like cool, wouldn't it?
[162:03.85]Like why doesn't he do... Okay, you know like Fullmetal Alchemist?
[162:07.63]You know the guy with the blonde hair?
[162:08.75]I forget his name.
[162:10.09]Stretch Armstrong?
[162:11.57]You know how he just goes like, flex this way and like, flex that way.
[162:14.51]Like, I'm huge.
[162:15.29]I wish he would do that.
[162:16.01]It would be like, funny.
[162:17.11]If he did it like, every episode.
[162:28.01]Never gonna have a problem with fucking parking ever again.
[162:31.76]How much does this cost?
[162:33.22]This is a big expense.
[162:34.24]I hope it's worth it.
[162:36.64]Alright, Dave.
[162:37.90]You got quite the work this afternoon.
[162:41.74]He's pretending he knows his name.
[162:43.20]I know his name's Armstrong.
[162:48.64]Alright, we turned a profit.
[162:54.08]I need another entrance.
[162:54.90]No, we need another store over here.
[162:56.26]Quickly.
[162:57.12]Bar.
[162:58.28]A bar.
[162:59.32]We need a bar over here.
[163:00.00]We're gonna make a bar.
[163:07.07]I got 104 grand.
[163:08.05]Let's make a bar.
[163:16.79]This is a huge investment here.
[163:20.51]Oh, what happened?
[163:24.63]This is a huge investment.
[163:25.77]I'm making a bar.
[163:40.57]Shit, it's 9 o'clock in the morning.
[163:41.79]At least they'll be parking.
[163:47.41]It's under construction so you can just walk in.
[163:51.59]You just park your car, walk through the grass, and then you're at the frozen food section.
[163:58.59]That's so stupid.
[164:00.07]Okay, whatever.
[164:01.27]Speed it up.
[164:01.66]Customers, customers, customers.
[164:05.02]500 sales, $20,000.
[164:05.18]Customers, more, more, more, more, more.
[164:12.78]Ah, that sound, that beep sound.
[164:17.32]Gotta love it.
[164:21.21]So much more customers can fit in here now, and this is gonna be a bar.
[164:32.83]Look at that.
[164:34.21]Even though the money we spent, come on!
[164:36.99]No!
[164:38.79]Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.
[164:40.25]Buy, buy.
[164:45.80]Keep buying, keep buying, keep buying, keep buying, keep buying.
[164:50.58]Oh, it's getting a little overbought.
[164:52.36]It might be time to sell it.
[164:55.80]We did, we did, look at that.
[164:56.90]We did good.
[164:57.78]2,000 bucks.
[164:59.12]Didn't lose any money.
[165:03.52]Alright, let's get to work on this bar.
[165:08.52]A bar.
[165:08.80]What?
[165:09.80]What do you mean?
[165:16.29]Oh, shit.
[165:17.39]I need more mana.
[165:18.05]Okay.
[165:22.29]I don't want to run out of money.
[165:23.05]I'll do it slowly.
[165:23.75]We'll put some more stuff in here.
[165:25.67]We'll put alcohol in here and then eventually we'll just make it a bar.
[165:29.23]That sounds good to me.
[165:32.31]This is going to be essentials.
[165:37.33]Okay, so this is going to be... We're going to sell alcohol here and then we're going to eventually close the door and turn it into a bar.
[165:56.18]87 fucking K Andy.
[166:05.29]This parking lot sucks.
[166:07.29]At least it's turning into kind of an actual place.
[166:16.16]Why is the wall all messed up?
[166:18.04]Um... I have no... I don't know.
[166:21.80]I think because they have to finish building this shit first.
[166:28.22]Okay.
[166:28.84]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[166:30.28]Hold on, hold on.
[166:30.86]This is so ton of... This is so much parking.
[166:46.47]Oh shit!
[166:47.71]Nice!
[166:50.75]Alright!
[166:51.73]Alright, I made a hundred dollars!
[166:54.47]I did it!
[166:55.99]I'm positive a hundred dollars for the day!
[167:00.65]Excellent!
[167:01.95]Good work everybody!
[167:02.75]Alright, this is really ugly.
[167:13.48]See, I'm doing okay.
[167:14.84]I got 90 grand in the bank.
[167:25.73]I need to have some doors over here, though.
[167:34.39]Um, is he going to build this?
[167:37.31]Oh, what?
[167:39.19]Oh, shit.
[167:39.71]I get it.
[167:40.03]Okay, because it's sitting.
[167:42.49]It's in a bad spot.
[167:43.22]Okay, I get it.
[167:56.77]Hurry before they get here.
[167:57.57]Fuck, this has to go too.
[168:04.77]Hurry up, get rid of it.
[168:19.06]More profit!
[168:20.78]More money!
[168:29.42]Oh, why are people using this?
[168:32.42]Okay, people are just using that for fun.
[168:34.18]Move that quick.
[168:38.42]Omega Lull, nice roof.
[168:39.71]There is no roof.
[168:41.59]They don't have, there's no roof in the whole game.
[168:44.89]I know this.
[168:45.41]They're trying to mess with me.
[168:49.57]Don't mess with me, dude.
[168:50.53]Okay, two entrances.
[169:01.78]Ah, we got real customers coming in.
[169:03.28]They're still going through the fucking door.
[169:07.14]Yeah, I got it.
[169:07.84]Okay, alcohol.
[169:12.14]This is assigned already.
[169:14.06]I need liquor.
[169:18.00]Alcohol cabinet.
[169:20.50]Beverages.
[169:21.34]Beer.
[169:21.74]Okay, we can have a little beer stand.
[169:32.91]Dude, why are you doing that?
[169:34.89]Alcohol right here.
[169:40.19]And then we'll do like wine.
[169:43.68]That's alright.
[169:50.40]Beverages.
[169:51.42]Beer.
[169:52.69]Beer.
[169:58.39]Only beer?
[170:03.42]It's only beer.
[170:05.00]Why?
[170:05.18]Um, it's juices.
[170:10.08]We'll have like juice.
[170:11.90]Like mixers, you know?
[170:12.76]And then... Um... Get rid of these.
[170:19.55]No, just make them fucking... Who cares?
[170:22.23]Full of bottled waters?
[170:25.24]Looks good.
[170:27.00]Dock it up.
[170:27.88]Now we have alcohol.
[170:29.76]I need more research for wine.
[170:30.96]Okay.
[170:31.26]Well, whatever.
[170:32.22]Beer's pretty expensive.
[170:34.32]Please look at the link.
[170:36.00]Alright, hold on.
[170:36.60]Relax.
[170:50.77]This is just creepy.
[171:00.49]Imagine looking up and seeing that.
[171:02.39]Would you still shop here?
[171:03.21]Alright, what if the prices were really low?
[171:12.53]Like, we're talking $1 for a large soda at McDonald's low.
[171:19.91]If everything was like 80% off.
[171:22.49]But sometimes.
[171:24.19]That guy would just.
[171:26.71]Reach in.
[171:28.05]And like pick up somebody.
[171:29.89]And just go like.
[171:31.97]Just drop him and swallow him.
[171:34.39]He did it like once an hour.
[171:35.50]Would you still drop there?
[171:37.10]No.
[171:49.92]Okay, so let's say a thousand people go in there in an hour.
[171:53.65]That's a one out of a thousand chance it's going to be you.
[171:58.73]And I didn't say you couldn't run around and grab something and throw it at him and try to get away and dodge behind stuff.
[172:03.83]You can do that.
[172:04.49]He might not get you.
[172:07.86]He might just be like, and just go for the person over there.
[172:12.96]Still no.
[172:14.32]We're talking 80% off everything in the whole store.
[172:19.23]Come on, give me some more money.
[172:21.55]We gotta fill these parking spaces.
[172:22.98]Nobody wants anything in here.
[172:23.98]What do they want?
[172:24.94]Halloween.
[172:26.60]Candy and greeting cards.
[172:27.82]I can do that.
[172:28.52]Let's do that.
[172:28.98]Refill this.
[172:29.52]Candy and greeting cards.
[172:32.10]This is all school supplies.
[172:32.96]Get this shit out of here.
[172:37.49]Oh, we need food shelves.
[172:38.39]Oh, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.
[172:41.89]The school supplies thing is done.
[172:48.56]Although...
[172:51.70]I'd wait outside until I saw somebody get grabbed and then I'd go in.
[172:54.88]Okay, so that's not a bad strategy.
[172:58.15]What if you pull up there and you don't know when the last time he did it was?
[173:01.51]Like, what if you pulled up there and he's sitting there just looking down?
[173:04.71]How can you tell?
[173:05.27]How do you know when he did it?
[173:07.23]You would just wait an hour.
[173:10.24]So you would sit there for a full hour and then when you saw him grab someone, then you would go in.
[173:17.30]So it's worth waiting a full hour in the parking lot.
[173:25.51]listen to talk radio now with the parking lot is you can't sit in there for more than an hour every one of the parking spaces has like a meter on it and when you like pull in it's like it's like a 20 minute meter goes starts counting down if you don't get the hell out of there you gotta pull out within 20 minutes
[173:54.70]Or his eyes just go right over to your car.
[174:00.08]And he just puts his hand up and he like, the Hulk grabs you and like just throws you into the atmosphere.
[174:10.39]Still going?
[174:13.37]Just park somewhere else and walk.
[174:15.61]Park, okay.
[174:16.69]So if you park here, you park like over here and like camp out overnight and just with binoculars.
[174:22.02]And then just wait and see when he does it.
[174:23.32]And then like, what if it takes you, it's going to take you like 40, 30, 40 minutes to walk this far.
[174:30.91]By the time you get here, you have probably like 20 minutes to get the fuck out of there.
[174:42.33]How far do you live from the store?
[174:45.17]I don't know.
[174:45.45]You might like live here.
[174:46.63]You might be like camped out here.
[174:49.51]Play the video game.
[174:51.87]Hey.
[174:52.23]I'll tell you when I'm ready to play the video game.
[174:54.16]Alright?
[174:55.00]Bro.
[174:58.28]Will you research the bar already so I can do this shit?
[175:00.00]Come on.
[175:02.64]Earned a profit for the day.
[175:05.66]Take a look at that.
[175:09.26]Everyone thought it was over.
[175:12.08]Everyone thought it was over when we hit that bottom.
[175:13.92]No, we're back.
[175:18.18]It doesn't take you 30 minutes to walk less than a mile.
[175:20.12]This is not less than a mile.
[175:22.52]It's probably like 5 miles.
[175:31.53]53%.
[175:31.67]Can I afford to put another two desks in here?
[175:34.81]What do you think?
[175:37.53]I think I can afford it.
[175:43.71]He's never walked in his life.
[175:46.41]He has a car pick him up.
[175:54.15]Yeah, guys, like, my, like, feet are, like, so, like, sensitive and soft because I've never walked.
[176:01.05]I just, like, have somebody pick me up and, like, walk me to a car, carry me, and, like, put me in the back seat, and then they drive me somewhere, and then somebody puts me in a carriage, and they push me around the store, and I point at stuff.
[176:17.09]If I, like, walked two or three steps, it'd be like, ah, ah, somebody pick me up.
[176:38.76]I've never used them.
[176:45.42]Did I make them look?
[176:46.28]No.
[176:52.21]stop stop what just stop just stop get back in here and build that alright we need uh another person wait we can do five alright five we'll do five people in the office I got money I need three people no two more people in the office who are we hiring you're digging yourself deeper
[177:24.84]Why do you assume that I have a shovel in my hand?
[177:37.37]Because of the grave.
[177:39.43]What?
[177:40.67]-2.
[177:41.41]Fuck you.
[177:42.13]That sucked.
[177:43.03]What?
[177:44.85]I'm saying, you assume that I'm even aware of what I'm even talking about?
[177:54.27]That was- that wasn't even a joke, that was me just be- like, oh, you're digging, you're digging yo- yo- yourself deeper, and I'm like, wow, you think I got a shovel?
[178:00.79]No, that's like a rebuttal to, like, you think I- what, you think I know what you're talking about?
[178:06.05]It's smart.
[178:07.01]It was very smart.
[178:19.28]What the fuck?
[178:20.80]Alright, I gotta hire people.
[178:23.03]I can't keep up with this.
[178:27.77]Just mute it.
[178:29.13]Just mute the stream.
[178:29.85]That's how I do it.
[178:30.47]53.
[178:39.44]Okay, higher.
[178:42.92]I need to assign this.
[178:44.14]That would be good if I did that.
[178:47.81]I don't even like this game.
[178:54.39]Okay.
[178:57.75]Hire office worker.
[178:58.69]Hmm.
[179:06.15]Actually, you too.
[179:18.04]You're better.
[179:18.42]Alright.
[179:20.92]That's a full office now.
[179:29.16]Thanks for breaking completely, Twitch.
[179:31.08]What happened?
[179:31.46]What happened?
[179:32.16]Twitch is messed up right now.
[179:34.16]How so?
[179:37.66]Then I can finally convert this to a bar.
[179:39.58]And we can have a grocery store bar.
[179:48.37]Guys, the stream is a lot better on mute.
[179:49.73]Try it out.
[179:50.15]It's really good.
[179:50.73]No, seriously.
[179:53.87]I kind of feel like it would be pretty shitty, actually.
[180:03.56]Alright, we got people working.
[180:04.78]This is going good.
[180:06.96]17 more man hours and we can finally have a bar.
[180:11.28]Here's the question.
[180:11.80]Should I have the bar just be over here?
[180:13.42]Or should I make this the bar?
[180:22.71]Oh, there's an annoying dickhead talking.
[180:28.87]Make it a separate building?
[180:29.71]Alright, we're going to make it up here.
[180:32.31]Or like right here.
[184:24.93]That was low effort.
[184:27.45]High effort.
[184:29.37]Yay, high effort.
[184:35.38]Oh, but apparently that's funnier than the, I didn't bring a shovel thing.
[184:38.88]Let me write that down.
[184:46.84]I don't like this patch of grass.
[184:54.03]Alright, bar.
[184:54.69]Let's go.
[184:55.37]70%.
[184:55.63]70%.

[185:06.27]I need more customers.
[185:11.41]I need a bar.
[185:12.33]This dude's unclippable.
[185:15.41]Are you sure?
[185:15.81]Okay.
[185:40.54]Somebody just wrote, good one.
[185:42.92]Yeah, I know.
[185:43.52]That was pretty bad.
[185:46.46]Hurry up and research this shit.
[185:47.44]I want to make a bar.
[185:50.41]Oh, come on.
[185:50.99]Really?
[185:51.23]300 bucks, though.
[185:54.41]That's not bad.
[185:58.61]And then I'm going to do night hours, because then the bar can stay open 24-7, right?
[186:06.81]I'm not going to spend any money.
[186:07.77]I'm just going to save it.
[186:14.07]Why are your employees in a broom closet?
[186:17.52]Um, no, this is the staff entryway.
[186:24.52]They come in here.
[186:25.76]I guess this is kind of like the little, like, room to get, like... When they put the hazmat suits on and they go through the thing.
[186:35.67]What's that room called?
[186:37.97]A decontamination room, right.

[188:12.94]How big should a bar be?
[188:14.24]Bars aren't that huge, are they?
[188:17.00]They're not massive.
[188:18.04]They're not like this.
[188:20.64]I don't know, man.
[188:22.18]That's a lot of money.
[188:22.82]I don't have the money to do that.
[188:28.68]I'm going to run out of capital if I do that.
[188:30.24]This is not a smart idea.
[188:39.18]I don't have enough money.
[188:41.14]Do something already.
[188:42.44]What the fuck?
[188:43.58]This is like a sim, slow sim game.
[188:47.59]Alright, I'm gonna do this.
[188:49.87]33,000?
[188:51.27]I hope it's worth it.
[188:52.79]After this, I can't spend any money.

[213:11.62]This is paused, right?
[213:13.28]It is now.
[213:14.50]I'll be right back.
[213:25.16]you
[214:59.00]Thank you.
[215:29.02]you
[216:04.85]Thank you.
[216:50.23]Hello.
[216:52.82]Alright, let's take a look.
[217:09.34]Why is there one... Why is there a McDonald's bag in there?
[217:14.07]And a McDonald's drink.
[217:14.91]Did you... You didn't... Where'd you get... How'd you do that?
[217:23.48]Okay, cool.
[217:26.42]Your McDonald's, hand it over.
[217:38.82]Okay, time for our fresh fruit and fresh veggies and fresh bread.
[217:47.10]We went down some money because I made the bar.
[217:49.84]But I have a bar now, and you... I don't know what you are doing.
[217:55.04]You have... This person's been sitting here the entire time.
[217:58.80]And they won't leave.
[217:59.70]It's currently... How late is it?
[218:00.80]What time is it?
[218:01.32]There's nobody here.
[218:03.10]It's midnight.
[218:14.41]What are you leaving with?
[218:16.97]Hey, you just left here with fresh fruit!
[218:19.84]Did you see the bag?
[218:20.44]You had a bag of groceries.
[218:21.54]Get back.
[218:31.53]You told her to work that late.
[218:32.73]Yeah, because I wanted to have a bar open until like 2 or 3.
[218:37.01]Alright, the bar is ready.
[218:43.83]What are we researching right now?
[218:44.91]Something.
[218:45.67]Frozen food?
[218:46.31]No.
[218:46.67]Sales.
[218:47.15]Right, right.
[218:47.51]Sales.
[218:47.75]Okay.
[218:49.49]These people are still working, right?
[218:50.55]Yeah.
[218:50.69]Alright, let's let the money roll in for a little while.
[218:53.29]I need a bigger staff room.
[219:00.91]I mean, not really.
[219:01.57]Just... Going home.
[219:07.87]Alright, see you later.
[219:10.55]Anything I can do for small improvements?
[219:12.00]I only have 20 grand.
[219:12.82]I don't want to spend it.
[219:21.74]Not even a coffee pot.
[219:23.30]Look, I'll help.
[219:25.72]Here.
[219:26.47]How's this?
[219:30.65]This isn't a staff room.
[219:31.41]It's a maintenance room.
[219:33.79]Coffee shop counter.
[219:34.87]No.
[219:35.27]I can give them a plant.
[219:37.53]What can I... Hold on.
[219:38.24]Let me look at some of this stuff.
[219:41.36]I could give them a table with some fresh bread on it.
[219:57.28]Do your homework.
[219:59.08]Give him a microwave.
[219:59.90]Fresh vegetables.
[220:05.31]Give him a water cooler.
[220:07.49]I'll make this a little... Alright, a little bit bigger.
[220:09.37]This is too small.
[220:11.97]It's four grand that I'm not going to get back.
[220:21.04]This is all messed up.
[220:34.29]I hate that.
[220:35.23]I hate it.
[220:35.61]There you go.
[220:47.28]Bigger staff room.
[220:50.04]Move the fresh vegetables over here.
[220:55.08]We'll give you a little place to sit down.
[220:59.31]Seat.
[220:59.95]Sit.
[221:01.89]Sink.
[221:03.61]Seat.
[221:04.17]Oh, I can give them like reclining chairs?
[221:05.79]Not yet.
[221:06.15]There.
[221:26.20]See?
[221:26.90]Much better environment.
[221:32.86]Oh, wait.
[221:33.86]That's why.
[221:34.20]Okay, maintenance center.
[221:39.51]Better.
[221:39.75]Fresh vegetables.
[221:41.75]Okay, let's start the day.
[221:47.53]It's not a prison cell.
[221:53.23]Make an actual staff room?
[221:56.48]Um... I don't know if there is that.
[222:04.91]Storage, a store, fast food, ticket lobby, movie theater.
[222:08.92]I need cinema.
[222:10.70]Maintenance center.
[222:13.42]Bowling alley, office.
[222:15.84]Bar, security center.
[222:17.24]Coffee shop, food court, fitness center.
[222:21.25]Yeah, there's no staff room.
[222:24.59]Christmas supplies.
[222:26.51]Ooh, right, right, right, okay.
[222:30.67]So we need, uh, winter starts in one day.
[222:33.75]We need construction toys, action figures, I can do that.
[222:37.59]This is a food shelf.
[222:41.58]Okay, construction toys.
[222:44.60]Toys.
[222:52.74]Action figures.
[222:53.44]Construction toys.
[222:58.28]Action figures.
[223:00.59]What else do you want?
[223:02.41]Board games, greeting cards, video games.
[223:04.73]Okay, candy.
[223:07.16]Candies.
[223:08.44]This is candy here, right?
[223:10.08]Candy, candy.
[223:12.02]Four candies.
[223:14.20]We'll turn this into... Ooh, wine!
[223:18.83]I got wine!
[223:20.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[223:21.51]Let's get some wine over here.
[223:23.89]Wine and liquor.
[223:24.57]Bingo.
[223:25.83]Bingo.
[223:34.94]A member of your staff has died.
[223:36.74]That game is precious.
[223:41.86]I love that game so much.
[223:46.72]Seriously, I wish there was a casino in 2, 3, 4, and 5.
[223:52.25]Why couldn't there have been at least one more?
[223:57.95]Wasn't I researching clothing?
[224:04.51]Alcohol bar.
[224:06.63]Sales.
[224:07.49]Didn't I do clothing?
[224:09.53]I did, I did, I did, I did, I did.
[224:12.35]Okay, we need clothes.
[224:14.70]I need a clothing store.
[224:15.92]How much money do I have?
[224:17.00]Why did I make a fucking bar?
[224:18.12]What a useless thing to have here.
[224:20.36]Um, I need- We're gonna put clothes.
[224:23.86]Oh my god.
[224:24.48]Okay, hold on.
[224:25.36]Pause.
[224:31.19]This is the holiday section.
[224:36.03]Um, move this.
[224:37.51]Close.
[224:44.59]What kind of close?
[224:47.57]Game consoles.
[224:48.93]That's not close.
[224:52.40]We're still gonna put it here.
[225:02.92]Close.
[225:07.30]Okay.
[225:09.43]Clothing.
[225:09.91]Uh, men's underwear.
[225:14.49]Don't I have access to more stuff than just men's shoes?
[225:19.23]Okay, shoes?
[225:22.19]And underwear?
[225:32.70]Toilet alert.
[225:33.82]What?
[225:37.09]Is this place even open?
[225:37.91]No, not yet.
[225:38.33]There we go.
[225:43.67]Where's the janitor?
[225:49.24]I don't know.
[225:49.70]I'm losing a lot of money.
[225:50.80]I'm buying too much shit.
[225:52.74]Let's let it play out.
[225:53.34]10 o'clock.
[225:58.62]Bar open.
[226:01.80]Let's let the money roll in.
[226:06.82]Looking good.
[226:07.36]There at the table.
[226:08.10]Yes.
[226:08.90]You guys said the tables were a bad idea.
[226:10.38]You guys said the fresh bread was a bad idea.
[226:12.91]Oh, really?
[226:16.79]Oh, really?
[226:18.29]That was an order of fresh bread right there.
[226:21.13]26 bucks.
[226:21.59]Fresh bread and a beer.
[226:23.25]Fresh fruits and a beer.
[226:29.39]Oh, really?
[226:31.62]What was that?
[226:35.07]How we doing on money?
[226:35.71]Good?
[226:36.98]Look at this profit for today.
[226:39.20]Way better than it was before.
[226:47.86]All these alerts.
[226:53.08]Wait.
[226:54.41]Drugstore, bookstore, bowling alley.
[226:57.03]So many alerts.
[226:59.95]Customers are leaving the city because there are no restrooms.
[227:03.12]There's a restroom, there's a bathroom right here.
[227:04.80]Oh, you fucking assholes want one here.
[227:08.38]Okay, fine.
[227:09.55]Sure.
[227:12.17]I'll put a bathroom in here.
[227:13.91]Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[227:16.03]Whatever.
[227:16.39]Here, here's your bathroom.
[227:33.75]There.
[227:38.55]Mhm.
[227:53.60]There.
[227:54.05]Done.
[227:58.83]Bathroom.
[227:59.73]Door.
[228:01.87]Bathroom.
[228:02.95]Door.
[228:07.86]One-way swing gate?
[228:08.94]What?
[228:12.56]There.
[228:14.18]Ooh, sales monitor!
[228:15.22]Alright, there's a bathroom now.
[228:17.88]Alright, that takes care of that.
[228:20.99]That's the biggest profit we've had in one day.
[228:22.41]That's 1,200 bucks in a day.
[228:26.87]That's a pretty major profit.
[228:28.25]I'm running low on cash, but I should be fine now.
[228:30.33]We're gonna coast.
[228:33.88]Sales monitoring.
[228:34.80]It allows the automatic monitoring of sales, which you can review in the demand menu.
[228:40.02]Oh, shit.
[228:41.36]Demand.
[228:43.90]People want books real bad.
[228:45.54]Open a bookstore.
[228:48.50]How do I get a... I need books.
[228:50.62]Research books.
[228:56.48]Books.
[228:57.00]Right here.
[228:57.22]Alright, get on that.
[229:02.52]It's Amazon.
[229:03.52]Yeah.
[229:06.50]I got a bathroom.
[229:07.58]I've got... This is a bathroom too, right?
[229:09.80]Yeah.
[229:12.44]Nobody's using that bathroom.
[229:16.24]Next up, we're going to make a bookstore.
[229:21.70]This is turning into every store in one store.
[229:25.32]I don't like that.
[229:27.50]We're going to convert this to the liquor section.
[229:29.40]We're going to move some of these grocery store things around.
[229:31.80]We're going to have a bookstore right here.
[229:33.38]I need to make some money first.
[229:38.51]All these alerts.
[229:39.25]I know.
[229:40.21]Look, bathroom's fine.
[229:41.51]People want a drugstore.
[229:44.61]Builders can't access a work order.
[229:46.05]Yeah, I fixed it.
[229:49.02]People are hungry.
[229:50.46]Well, go to the bar and get the fresh bread already.
[229:52.42]What do you mean you're hungry?
[229:55.03]There's like meat, cheese, potatoes, onions, women's underwear, men's underwear.
[230:01.85]Plenty of stuff here.
[230:03.61]Shoes.
[230:04.05]Shoes are made out of leather.
[230:07.46]You could eat everything here.
[230:08.54]This is the worst mall.
[230:13.34]It starts slowly and then you build up your empire.
[230:20.65]I'm gonna turn this into like a shoe store.
[230:23.51]I only had $200,000.
[230:25.39]I had a small loan of $200,000.
[230:27.44]It's doing its Donald.
[230:32.88]Okay, that's how you know the stream has really gone off the rails.
[230:39.56]What's wrong with this?
[230:44.74]It's expired.
[230:46.24]Oh, somebody leaked it.
[230:55.50]Oh, bartender dummy.
[230:56.66]Yes, there is.
[230:57.46]Who thinks we're serving all the drinks?
[231:04.39]2016 meme.
[231:10.29]I know.
[231:10.61]Oh, turn a daily profit over 500 smackaroos.
[231:17.58]Wow, Jimmy Kimmel.
[231:19.18]Funny.
[231:19.54]Yeah.
[231:29.31]Okay, you got me there, you do.
[231:31.49]Wow, that was Jimmy Kimmel level funny.
[231:35.03]And guess what?
[231:36.33]A quarter of a billion people turned in to Jimmy Kimmel every afternoon when he's alive.
[231:41.62]Okay, so he's doing something right, isn't he?
[231:56.04]Alright, I'm just gonna, look at, I got 18 grand.
[231:57.62]Alright, we're gonna coast.
[232:03.02]It's just coasting time.
[232:04.10]We got plenty of parking, we got our drugs.
[232:06.52]This is, this is booze.
[232:08.02]Wait, ooh, look at that prophet.
[232:11.45]Look at the prophet here too.
[232:12.39]I am not losing, I'm slowly winning.
[232:15.85]He has more viewers than you.
[232:17.74]Yeah.
[232:19.02]Yes.
[232:19.77]Yes.
[232:20.53]Jimmy Kimmel has more of a larger audience than Jerma985.
[232:27.41]Yes, that is accurate.
[232:29.07]By probably a few million people.
[232:34.97]Oh, mega love.
[232:36.37]He's a nobody.
[232:39.61]You know, in the grand scheme of things, guys, yeah.
[232:46.07]I'm not like Jimmy Kimmel.
[232:51.36]Yet.
[232:53.94]Not yet.
[232:55.16]Let's see.
[233:00.40]Holy shit, man.
[233:01.14]Look at all this money.
[233:02.90]I need more cashiers.
[233:04.30]How slow are these cashiers?
[233:07.09]Not bad.
[233:08.03]I think they level up.
[233:10.05]I need more checkouts.
[233:12.97]This is bad.
[233:13.47]Um... Um...
[233:26.64]Okay, is it weird that I want to just build a checkout counter here?
[233:31.92]Like five checkouts connected to the same store essentials.
[233:35.96]So then they have to walk across the street and check out.
[233:43.17]There's no more room.
[233:43.91]It's surrounded by roads.
[233:45.99]I guess I could take some of this out and put it here.
[233:54.07]Bar is really not doing that well.
[233:55.82]I'm not happy with the performance here.
[234:01.48]Nobody's coming in to drink.
[234:05.22]Alright, we're okay.
[234:05.64]We're doing alright.
[234:09.98]Almost time to start the bookstore.
[234:21.91]Profit's not bad.
[234:22.51]What do we got?
[234:24.62]People want to go see major movie release.
[234:26.92]Fuck.
[234:27.62]That's too many things.
[234:30.46]Almost have enough for books.
[234:32.02]When that's done, we're doing books.
[234:33.25]How many people will work here?
[234:34.05]You guys are alright.
[234:36.45]Parking lot's getting a little full.
[234:46.01]Hope you don't plan on becoming an architect.
[234:48.45]No, I'm 35.
[234:48.99]I don't think that's a career choice I'm going to start, no.
[234:52.63]I don't think I'm going to just go to like 10 years of architect school.
[234:55.59]I don't think so.
[235:00.20]Not something I was very good at anyways.
[235:05.04]It's already something I know I'm not very good at.
[235:08.73]And I have to go to a lot of school for that.
[235:09.99]Probably be 45 or so when I started.
[235:13.72]Maybe 50.
[235:15.78]And work on maybe one or two major projects.
[235:17.88]And get fired from them because I screwed something up.
[235:21.29]52.
[235:21.39]Get fired.
[235:21.93]Okay.
[235:23.11]I don't know if I want to do that.
[235:33.05]Camel has 2.2 million viewers.
[235:35.13]You have 1.1 million.
[235:36.53]No.
[235:38.19]That's not how that works.
[235:46.88]You didn't want to have an enclosed mall with parking.
[235:49.30]Yeah, I did.
[235:51.06]I wanted it to be parking, just huge parking lot around it and then everything inside.
[235:54.46]And then like we got a bar over here, but that's not, I don't even own this.
[236:01.23]Big money today.
[236:02.47]Come on.
[236:03.79]Growth.
[236:04.40]More growth.
[236:06.28]Growth.
[236:06.62]Growth.
[236:06.92]Growth.
[236:08.02]Don't let these people leave without paying.
[236:12.96]Come on.
[236:13.42]Ring him up.
[236:14.34]Close the door.
[236:15.56]Close the door.
[236:16.16]Lock the door.
[236:17.14]Lock the door.
[236:20.18]That's so much product that we're just letting go for free.
[236:26.05]How could you be angry?
[236:26.99]Imagine being that angry and getting out of here with, like, fucking $180 worth of shit for free?
[236:33.13]Why are you so mad about that?
[236:34.91]Alright, we still grew.
[236:44.12]Almost ready for the bookstore.
[236:49.24]I need another cashier.
[236:51.88]I'll put it right here.
[236:54.23]That's another employee, though.
[236:55.93]Can I afford that?
[236:57.81]Let's move some stuff around.
[236:58.67]Alright, move some shit around here.
[237:04.35]This is going up.
[237:05.07]We need to really reorganize this place.
[237:06.73]This place sucks.
[237:08.61]Complete reorganization of this place.
[237:15.62]M, move.
[237:16.70]Up here.
[237:18.12]Move.
[237:19.46]Here.
[237:20.28]Move.
[237:20.88]Here.
[237:22.02]Move it.
[237:22.48]Put it right here.
[237:31.62]A little off.
[237:32.46]I hate it, but it's okay.
[237:35.56]This is gonna be plenty of room for checkout counter.
[237:37.48]Fuck.
[237:48.36]That one little thing.
[237:50.42]It's alright.
[237:50.92]Don't matter.
[238:05.88]Let's do that first so I can look at what it looks like.
[238:07.48]Okay, you gotta move this stuff.
[238:15.03]I already said, make it all vertical, please.
[238:20.19]I'm begging you.
[238:27.00]What do you mean all vertical?
[238:39.70]This is so much cleaner.
[238:45.04]You do all your shopping here.
[238:47.48]And then we'll do some checkout lines.
[238:48.66]This is going to be so much more efficient.
[238:52.26]Make it symmetrical.
[238:53.06]I don't know what to do with this guy.
[238:57.68]I do.
[239:00.78]That's better.
[239:01.30]Okay.
[239:02.57]I can't make it symmetrical.
[239:03.47]Doesn't matter.
[239:05.57]This down here.
[239:06.27]This is like the checkout line.
[239:07.61]People in the checkout line can kind of browse.
[239:12.30]We need more room, though, for the checkout.
[239:14.08]Like that.
[239:21.60]No, put this over here.
[239:24.72]No, no, no, no.
[239:25.54]Idiot.
[239:26.02]That's where the other checkout counter is going to go.
[239:27.68]Are you dumb?
[239:31.06]You're not even smart like me.
[239:32.10]Okay, then this can... I wish I put these.
[239:42.06]this isn't a mall okay when a bookstore gets opened here it's gonna be a mall you'll have a grocery store and booze emporium a bar and a bookstore that's like a strip mall all I just the only thing I need here is I need a sub shop and a verizon store and then what would you call it that's a mall
[240:10.74]Bar that opens at 10 in the morning.
[240:15.96]Just make it a Walmart, you Redditor.
[240:17.60]This is a bunch of storefronts.
[240:21.80]Yeah, you park your car and you can, like, go into the Verizon store.
[240:25.12]And then you can go into the sub shop.
[240:28.98]And then you can, like, go into the grocery store, get some stuff.
[240:31.08]And then you can just go over here and have, like, a fucking fresh fruit platter.
[240:37.74]Get a drink to go.
[240:38.69]In like a, well no, not like that.
[240:41.67]I mean like in a to go glass.
[240:43.37]Like take one of these and then like bring it home.
[240:45.29]But you don't even have to.
[240:46.15]Why is the bar even here?
[240:53.12]You can just buy alcohol here.
[240:54.58]Why is this here?
[240:59.24]If I sell alcohol here.
[241:02.09]Why are you going to go over here to buy alcohol?
[241:12.50]You don't go, hey, I'll pick up a couple bottles of wine.
[241:17.52]Hello, sir.
[241:18.88]I'll take a bottle of wine to go, please.
[241:20.89]Here you go.
[241:22.09]Thank you.
[241:22.47]Oh, by the way, here's $60.
[241:25.39]It was 12 over there in the grocery store.
[241:34.72]Why is there a bar here?
[241:43.03]But you can drink at the bar.
[241:46.94]Yeah, I guess.
[241:51.42]You know that people sit at bars.
[241:52.72]I know you can sit at a bar, but what?
[241:57.52]It's for the atmosphere.
[241:58.60]This person, no parking allowed here.
[242:03.48]What are you doing?
[242:03.98]Oh, no, that's a staff member.
[242:04.76]Okay.
[242:04.94]Alright, what was I doing?
[242:06.33]Moving this.
[242:09.87]Get rid of this fucking trash.
[242:14.10]The trash is fucking this all up.
[242:20.39]Why is that so off?
[242:24.95]Oh, it's backwards.
[242:34.04]Okay.
[242:38.08]No one wants to drink at a shitty bar.
[242:40.72]That's not true.
[242:44.45]I'm really sorry to tell you, but that is completely inaccurate.
[242:53.15]How would you know?
[242:54.87]You guys don't think I've been to like a bunch of... You don't think I've been to a shitty bar before?
[242:57.83]I'm 35.
[242:58.81]I'm not like 20.
[243:00.11]Hooters.
[243:12.18]No.
[243:13.30]35 and never been to a bar.
[243:16.06]That's not even accurate.
[243:22.66]There.
[243:23.46]Now we have tons of room.
[243:32.65]Look at that.
[243:34.41]Oh, bingo.
[243:42.46]That's probably enough for now.
[243:51.17]I need two more cashiers.
[243:53.71]Fuck, man.
[243:54.09]That's money I don't want to spend.
[243:56.71]What's going on?
[243:58.62]Views are full, yeah.
[243:59.72]People are hungry, whatever.
[244:00.76]People want a drugstore, sure.

[244:41.26]Almost time to open.
[244:51.25]It's a Christmas miracle.
[244:57.75]See, they were eating it.
[244:58.63]It was expired.
[244:59.35]Somebody ate it.
[244:59.85]Getting close to the bookstore.
[245:07.30]That's a pog moment.
[245:17.70]Uh, we need a cashier for essentials.
[245:19.76]Two of them, actually.
[245:20.50]Prezzo Dent.

[245:38.36]Time to open.
[245:42.46]Stock it up.
[245:46.38]We're so ever closer to the time the guy at the disresidence sleeper.
[245:51.22]Here we go.
[245:57.58]We need to make $2,000 in one day.
[246:05.72]Extra checkout lanes.
[246:07.28]Much more efficient placement of all goods.
[246:10.89]Anything even in here?
[246:13.65]These are all empty.
[246:14.25]It's okay.
[246:21.10]Bar.
[246:22.00]Opening.
[246:23.18]Here we go.
[246:25.94]Excuse me, ma'am.
[246:26.60]Can I interest you in some kiwis?
[246:29.40]And a tall wheat barley beer?
[246:37.05]I made $30,000 by having a bunch of sales.
[246:41.57]Efficiency.
[246:44.55]This is pretty efficient.
[246:45.70]Come on.
[246:46.44]Let's turn that profit.
[246:48.36]Be funny.
[246:48.98]Do something funny already.
[246:50.18]Time that guy off for five minutes.
[247:03.97]alright you know okay here's the thing you know like I mean how much money not enough okay so if you went up to like a professional athlete that was about to go up to to hit at the plate a baseball player and you said hey hit a home run next pitch they're gonna be like I I'm gonna try dude you better hit a home run on your next pitch and then they hit swing and they miss
[247:29.98]Hey!
[247:30.94]You were supposed to hit a home run on the next pitch, I told you.
[247:34.96]Man, I hit a home run like once every three games, dude.
[247:39.38]I can't just do it?
[247:40.76]I can't just hit a fucking home run when I feel like it?
[247:44.57]Yeah?
[247:45.91]Well, guess who Mo Vaughn could?
[247:48.49]Mo Vaughn hasn't played baseball in like 20 years, man.
[247:54.18]I'm on the team now.
[247:56.22]Yeah, I wish it was Mo Vaughn, not you.
[248:00.42]Okay, and I swing and I miss again.
[248:03.60]That's strike two, man.
[248:04.49]You're in my head.
[248:11.08]Analogy Andy.
[248:26.10]Jimmy Kimmel could.
[248:27.06]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[248:28.06]Like, Jimmy Kimmel is like funnier than you.
[248:30.06]I don't care.
[248:35.74]Jimmy Kimmel swallowed five eggs on camera last night.
[248:39.21]Why didn't you do Chubby Bunny to one-up him?
[248:54.85]You got a low batting average.
[248:57.97]I've said this before.
[249:00.23]But you guys understand that if you go up to play in baseball and you strike out seven times in a row, when you hit the ball into play and you get on base three times out of ten, you are one of the best baseball players to ever live.
[249:20.88]If you can get a 300 batting average, you're like one of the best players to ever play the game.
[249:27.74]So that means I'm allowed seven wicked shitty jokes.
[249:30.60]As long as I tell three good ones.
[249:33.12]I'm one of the best joke tellers to ever live.
[249:43.77]This is not baseball.
[249:51.92]You gotta draw some walks.
[249:53.22]No, swing and miss only.
[249:54.82]And then hit ball.
[249:58.96]Baseball isn't funny.
[250:00.44]You got a long way to go, buddy.
[250:01.78]Alright.
[250:06.09]I got $48,000.
[250:06.83]Holy shit.
[250:09.85]You are such a quintessential American.
[250:13.35]Okay, we can do a bookstore now.
[250:17.64]Thanks, I guess.
[250:18.42]I don't know.
[250:19.74]What does that mean?
[250:23.18]Hand tools, power tools.
[250:25.60]I want a movie theater.
[250:28.44]I'm not going to do this yet.
[250:29.28]I'm going to after the close today.
[250:37.38]We're going to make our way.
[250:38.22]Do people even care about books anymore?
[250:40.38]No, they don't.
[250:42.15]I'm so late to every one of these events.
[250:45.97]What's coming up next?
[250:46.99]Valentine's Day.
[250:47.91]Wine, jewelry, candies.
[250:49.51]Okay, we still have that up there.
[250:51.85]We want a movie theater.
[251:00.09]Books are cringe.
[251:04.30]Uh.
[251:07.92]Okay.
[251:08.22]Come on, big profit today.
[251:14.82]Is it the car spaces?
[251:16.12]I need more customers.
[251:20.19]We're getting them out very, very quickly.
[251:24.09]This is really, really good efficiency, though.
[251:27.56]Come on, give me that.
[251:28.26]Big money, big money, big money.
[251:29.20]Got it.
[251:30.26]That's it?
[251:33.00]That's, uh... What is that?
[251:34.72]I have 2,000 bucks in a day, right?
[251:37.29]Oh, what?
[251:38.61]After hours, what happened?
[251:47.29]Turn off the stream.
[251:48.35]Cringe Chris.
[251:49.11]Connect the roads for the love of God.
[252:01.95]I mean, I committed to the bookstore idea, but now... Who wants to go to a bookstore at a mall?
[252:11.17]No, I want like an arcade.
[252:12.40]I'm making an arcade.
[252:14.62]Or maybe movie theater should be the next thing.
[252:19.62]Move the garbage?
[252:21.22]Check demand charts.
[252:26.36]Fast food, soda, milk.
[252:30.56]Okay, this is the quintessential American.
[252:35.12]Not me.
[252:35.87]This is it.
[252:37.23]Fast food, soda, and milk.
[252:45.95]What do I make of fast food?
[252:48.15]I'm already doing like a cinema.
[252:53.46]I have restaurants 1.
[252:56.21]Unlocks fast food restaurants.
[252:57.72]Fuck.
[253:00.84]Damn it.
[253:01.28]I need... Okay.
[253:03.56]Work on this.
[253:06.98]I'm gonna expand the office a little more too.
[253:08.44]I have money.
[253:09.64]I think I can do it.
[253:12.44]What do you guys think?
[253:13.42]Yes or no?
[253:16.44]Hey, Chad Andy.
[253:17.39]What do you think?
[253:32.83]Make a fast food movie theater?
[253:34.15]That's actually not a bad idea.
[253:47.55]I'm going to regret this, I think, but whatever.
[253:49.13]It's a lot of money, but I want that research.
[253:55.97]It's too slow.
[254:01.06]How many more people do I need?
[254:03.77]Manage.
[254:04.13]Assign.
[254:04.65]This.
[254:07.07]Oh, you dummy.
[254:11.85]What are you doing?
[254:16.59]Okay, office.
[254:19.15]Manage.
[254:19.87]We need... Okay, office.
[254:23.85]There's one, two, three, four.
[254:25.09]There's five people that work here.
[254:26.25]How many seats are there?
[254:27.11]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[254:29.88]We need six more people.
[254:32.52]Jesus.
[254:35.77]Office work.
[254:36.57]Come on in.
[254:38.81]I just have to hire everybody.
[254:42.09]It doesn't matter how bad they are.
[254:43.35]Alright, we're up to two more.
[254:49.27]Okay.
[254:53.29]This should really speed that up.
[255:02.43]We should really get fast food soon.
[255:05.65]39 man hours.
[255:06.41]Karma's not a Redditor?
[255:15.94]I use Reddit.
[255:17.90]Like, look stuff up sometimes.
[255:26.94]I thought you were OCD.
[255:27.92]Fix the roads.
[255:30.17]Like, that's... I can't even, like...
[255:35.07]No, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[255:38.76]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[255:39.70]Connect the roads like this?
[255:53.13]Oh, shit, that gives me more parking spaces.
[255:54.63]Thanks, dude.
[256:06.80]What am I doing on money?
[256:07.94]31?
[256:09.84]Look at how much faster this is going up.
[256:11.42]We'll get that in one day.
[256:12.78]Movie theater.
[256:13.36]Going right here.
[256:13.88]Come on.
[256:22.56]What about the hole?
[256:23.22]I got it.
[256:23.92]There you go.
[256:27.12]I'm done.
[256:29.68]Pretty good.
[256:30.89]Not bad.
[256:37.60]Alright, we got 50%.
[256:38.80]We got one more day or so.
[256:41.86]I'm making money.
[256:43.06]I'm not losing any money.
[256:44.72]We're fine.
[256:45.30]Fix the fucking corners.
[256:50.33]I can't.
[256:51.09]What do you want me to do?
[256:57.68]It's not a big deal.
[257:02.18]What the fuck is that?
[257:04.98]How would you even get out?
[257:06.60]Okay, if somebody was parked here... If somebody was parked here... What do you do?
[257:14.37]You're in deep shit.
[257:28.76]No, stop!
[257:29.66]Fuck!
[257:30.28]Whatever.
[257:32.32]That's why I can't connect the roads.
[257:35.98]Actually, wait a minute.
[257:36.64]Oh, shit.
[257:37.02]I can lead this up to here to a new world.
[257:40.80]Oh, who cares?
[257:43.94]Make it loop?
[257:51.36]No, because this can go out this way eventually.
[257:54.16]This can go up here.
[257:55.00]Alright, I got 29,000.
[258:03.64]Please connect the dotted lines.
[258:04.94]Wait.
[258:08.34]Hold on.
[258:09.68]Do you mean this?
[258:27.41]Like that.
[258:29.37]Please no.
[258:30.05]No.
[258:31.49]What do you mean connect the dotted lines?
[258:36.70]I can't do anything with these.
[258:38.54]Move the trash zone.
[258:44.54]Actually pretending.
[258:47.24]You mean like this?
[258:51.84]Like that.
[258:52.64]Like a loop.
[258:53.36]Like this.
[258:57.70]No.
[258:58.14]Bottom.
[258:58.52]What are you talking about?
[258:59.42]Because this is going to go down and around.
[259:00.72]Pod washers.
[259:02.40]Skip.
[259:03.82]Vrowing for content.
[259:04.82]I don't know what you guys want me to do with this.
[259:07.68]Otto's yelling at me.
[259:09.57]Delete the one parking spot.
[259:19.83]Right in fucking front of you.
[259:23.29]Dude, okay.
[259:24.77]I know that there's a dotted line here, but what the fuck are you talking about?
[259:29.39]What do you want me to do with it?
[259:31.64]What do you want me to do with this?
[259:34.88]Remove this road?
[259:35.78]You're talking about this?
[259:49.18]It's a dead end.
[259:50.66]Yeah, but who... These guys... These people are like ants.
[259:54.46]They just go around.
[259:56.54]It's not like they actually have to park here.
[259:58.59]It's like an ant algorithm that parks them here.
[260:07.05]Please do click maps.
[260:08.33]I don't have click maps enabled.
[260:12.26]Oh my god!
[260:19.60]There!

[260:22.20]Hold on, hold on.
[260:31.55]I gotta get my dog.
[260:37.56]Get back out there and do that.
[260:48.37]No, fuck.
[260:48.99]I'm trying to get this to connect.
[260:51.91]That's fine.
[260:53.73]Good enough.
[260:54.23]Yeah, stay.
[260:54.85]I know.

[280:42.39]Well, I didn't have the money to make a giant mall.
[280:47.05]Oh, so what?

[292:17.89]Wait.
[292:20.12]Where do you see?
[292:20.68]How can you tell?
[292:21.42]Is there a way I can see how much shoplifting there's been?
[292:32.66]It's been happening for hours?
[292:35.12]What are you talking about?
[292:43.85]Net profit peak daily unsatisfied theft.

[293:06.01]Okay, the last five days, I've been robbed like fucking 200 times.
[293:12.05]People are running in and just grabbing handfuls of bread and running out of the store?
[293:15.53]Yeah, I lose.
[293:25.59]I lose like probably $500 to $1,000 a day in profit and theft.
[293:32.90]So, I need security.
[293:34.36]Where's those things that when you walk by, they go... Oh, fuck.
[293:39.22]Okay.
[293:39.68]Security.
[293:42.74]We don't have any cameras.
[293:48.74]No security in any store.
[293:54.20]I can't even tell.
[293:54.90]You know what?
[293:55.40]Let's follow some people and see if they even go to the checkout.
[294:02.86]Let's see.
[294:03.16]I want to watch somebody pull in.
[294:04.10]Okay, you.
[294:07.75]You're in chat.
[294:08.93]You just stole something out of the trash.
[294:11.69]That guy took something out of the trash.
[294:14.81]He's going home now.
[294:17.29]Is that stealing or is this person just gross?
[294:23.89]Uh, okay.
[294:28.46]I think that person just went in and grabbed something and left.
[294:37.88]People really have been just walking in and taking things for the last five hours You wonder why I haven't been able to build anything and make any real money It's cuz like a 30% of all my margins are destroyed by builders walking out.
[294:56.18]I
[295:05.20]Why do I have so many cashiers?
[295:06.34]Dude, that was huge demand.
[295:07.60]You missed it.
[295:17.84]Alright.
[295:19.29]Let's let this run out for a second.
[295:20.87]And then I need to make a movie theater.
[295:27.39]You haven't fixed the person at the bar working when it's closed.
[295:30.89]What?
[295:31.09]What do you mean?
[295:38.83]Oh, shit.
[295:39.41]Alright, that's better.
[295:51.73]Shift planning.
[295:57.45]Alright, we're good.
[295:57.85]Do they just live here now?
[295:59.65]Oh, you can come out here with a couple of buddies and have a couple of aroos.
[296:07.72]They're not stealing this, right?
[296:08.66]No, you have to pay up front.
[296:13.88]What are you doing here?
[296:17.94]Oh, this is the overnight, uh, stalk person.
[296:22.49]We kind of only needed you for one day.
[296:23.73]Oh my god.
[296:33.05]Okay, guys.
[296:35.72]You can just open these doors and just grab a jug of milk and leave.
[296:40.57]I need to... Oh.
[296:49.14]You have to only be able to come in from one place.
[296:58.43]You don't even need to step in the store.
[296:59.81]You can just reach in and grab something before even putting your body into the store.
[297:06.32]You can leave.
[297:06.86]Did you not know that?
[297:14.58]I didn't know.
[297:15.66]I kind of didn't.
[297:16.54]I didn't know you could do that.
[297:20.36]I thought the security was people fighting.
[297:24.42]I don't know I thought like every time the security in a video game.
[297:27.18]It's usually Just like a security guard stands here, and if there's a fight they break it up in every sim game ever played Hey, how's that you steal that did you steal that did you steal that?
[297:44.09]Did you steal that you stole that you just grabbed it off the table and walked out you stole that You stole that
[298:02.80]I can't believe it.
[298:03.56]I can't believe this much has gone by.
[298:05.90]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[298:06.62]He has something.
[298:08.06]He has something too.
[298:09.96]Why is it just free food at Jeremy's?
[298:12.28]This is ridiculous.
[298:14.98]He had a bag of groceries.
[298:16.79]I don't even think these doors are locked.
[298:27.45]Can people just come in?
[298:31.46]This is why you need a two-entrance mall and not a promenade.
[298:33.76]I still can't believe it's just people walking out with shit.
[298:49.63]Like more than 50 plus times a day.
[298:53.55]20, at least 20 to 30 times a day.
[299:00.00]You know what?
[299:00.42]Go home.
[299:04.06]You're wasting money.
[299:05.08]Hey, hey, that doesn't mean you can take things.
[299:22.47]Ah, I can't laugh that hard right now.
[299:25.41]It's very funny that this has been going on the whole time.
[299:28.17]Oh well.
[299:31.68]Is there a way I can see how many times a specific thing has been stolen from?
[299:35.00]That would be so funny.
[299:36.80]Like, if I could look at that and see how many times somebody took out of it.
[299:42.36]Dude, you're so charitable.
[299:43.70]Thank you.
[299:47.13]Are you treating your employees ethically?
[299:49.61]Well, um, I bet you half of them have been walking out with free groceries every day.
[299:53.77]So, sure.
[299:54.55]I guess.
[299:58.61]There's no metal detector here?
[299:59.75]There's no cameras?
[300:05.33]Take only what you need.
[300:10.09]Guys, that doesn't work.
[300:13.41]You know what happens to the Halloween bowl that says, honesty, one please.
[300:20.12]That whole bowl is gone.
[300:22.16]And I'm not just talking about the candy inside.
[300:23.72]I'm talking about the bowl too.
[300:26.68]It's gone within five minutes of it being out there.
[300:37.17]And then that sign that says honesty take one is covered in some kind of shaving cream.
[300:47.63]That policy doesn't work.
[300:52.03]The sign is gone too.
[300:53.05]Yeah.
[300:53.34]Oh, the sign's kicked over and there's like five or six distinct foot like shoe prints all over it.
[301:02.66]He knows because he was the one that did it.
[301:04.78]No, I never did that.
[301:06.22]I never did that.
[301:10.77]I didn't even take candy out of that bowl.
[301:17.89]You know, what you could do,
[301:20.66]Some people did this.
[301:21.84]I remember in my neighborhood, there was somebody that was like just dressed up as like a scarecrow.
[301:26.60]You know, they had like a scarecrow outfit and a costume and they were just sitting in a lawn chair in the front lawn.
[301:30.85]It's like, wait, is that a real person?
[301:32.51]I don't know.
[301:33.75]And then you come up to the door and they go like, alright, kids, happy Halloween.
[301:38.10]Right.
[301:38.26]They're pretending to be like a monster just sitting there.
[301:40.88]Are they a statue or are they alive?
[301:42.64]Is it a stuffed person?
[301:44.52]Have the honesty ball there.
[301:47.85]And when people come up and you're dressed up as the scarecrow guy or in a monster costume sitting there.
[301:54.71]And when they come up and they grab more than one, you can get up and be like, You took more than one candy!
[302:00.27]Put it back!
[302:01.70]And they'll be like, Oh!
[302:02.88]I'm sorry, Mr. Anderson!
[302:04.72]That's right.
[302:06.34]That's how we learn.
[302:11.96]You little shit!
[302:14.12]No, no, no, no.
[302:14.80]You can't do that.
[302:26.07]Old man arrested.
[302:27.19]There's only one box in here.
[302:36.38]Go clean that up.
[302:37.88]No, pick up the trash.
[302:39.28]Don't just spray the trash.
[302:40.96]You can't just walk in here and spray trash with Febreze and think that's going to solve the problem.
[302:46.00]You have to deal with the solution.
[302:47.54]You have to solution to the problem, not mask the problem.
[303:00.86]Just leave a trail of candy.
[303:02.64]Get full-sized candy bars and put them in a line on the ground.
[303:06.85]In a gigantic, like, big line that goes around, you know, all the front yard.
[303:12.93]And then it leads up to the guy that's sitting in the chair.
[303:15.77]He's a trap.
[303:22.12]Ah, I see you've completed the challenge of taking all the candy in the line.
[303:28.82]Now put it back exactly how it was.
[303:31.04]Did he do Chubby Bunny?
[303:36.41]I did.
[303:36.63]It's fucking hilarious.
[303:50.12]I'm glad there's no dead.
[303:55.83]Alright, fast food.
[303:56.86]Delicious.
[303:58.02]Office workers are doing okay.
[303:59.34]What's our demand look like?
[304:00.44]Hopefully it's movies.
[304:01.44]Uh, theft has gone up.
[304:04.86]Theft is going up.
[304:06.46]It's in a high upward trend.
[304:09.29]I wouldn't be surprised if people were just going into the storeroom.
[304:17.83]Get security?
[304:18.49]I have to research security.
[304:21.14]It's not done yet.
[304:29.38]I'm making a movie theater.
[304:30.36]I'm making a movie theater.
[304:31.86]You can't steal from the movie theater.
[304:35.36]That's my biggest problem.
[304:36.26]I should have done things you cannot steal from.
[304:38.12]You cannot steal from the movie theater.
[304:39.79]You have to sit and actually watch the movie.
[304:42.85]Sure, yeah, you could pirate the movie, but if you go to the movie theater, you can't take the screen.
[304:56.74]Alright, let's make it.
[304:58.00]Taking another loan out.
[304:58.80]I don't even care.
[305:01.26]Smartphones.
[305:02.16]Ooh.

[305:03.60]Alright.
[305:04.28]I'm taking out a loan.
[305:10.85]Where's the loan button?
[305:18.71]Okay.
[305:19.89]Loan duration.
[305:21.49]I'm taking out $35,000.
[305:26.42]I'll pay this back.
[305:35.72]Movie theater time.
[305:37.33]In the promenade.
[305:37.99]Fuck, that's too expensive.
[305:52.91]Alright, movie theater.
[305:53.51]Let's go.
[306:03.38]Buy another loan?
[306:05.34]Otherwise, we would have to just sit here and wait.
[306:07.74]I don't want to wait.
[306:08.86]I want... I want my promenade to look good and be good.
[306:14.03]Alright, sign.
[306:14.35]Movie theater.
[306:21.39]Movie theater.
[306:21.97]Okay.

[306:24.81]Sure.
[306:26.51]Movie theater.
[306:31.47]I need a ticket lobby.
[306:33.09]Buy tickets, such as movies.
[306:35.26]Mandatory from movie theaters.
[306:36.40]Okay, ticket lobby.
[306:40.30]Wait.
[306:42.12]Alright, ticket lobby here, and then you go right, here's the theater.
[306:48.18]What do we need?
[306:48.72]We need, let's pause it.
[306:51.01]We need a wall first.
[306:57.29]Door.
[306:57.39]Door.
[307:07.08]Uh, put a staff door, like, back here.
[307:13.03]Is this an adult theater?
[307:14.23]No.
[307:15.19]We're gonna be playing Frozen.
[307:16.81]Back to back to back to back.
[307:20.11]All the kids will show up.
[307:22.58]Oh, is this a mall?
[307:24.78]Um, movie theater, bar, fast food restaurant, office, uh...
[307:31.56]grocery store and knickknacks and shoe store.
[307:36.34]This is a mall.

[307:50.87]What do you mean?
[307:51.83]Yes, they are.

[311:57.34]Okay, we have to fire everybody in the office.
[311:59.82]I'm sorry, everybody, but you did good, but everybody has to be fired.

[312:35.33]I opened up a bar and nobody cares.
[312:36.65]And I didn't have enough money to make a movie theater.
[312:44.09]Um, what are these?
[312:44.83]What are they?

[312:51.32]Look at those things.
[312:51.86]Like, you pull it and throw it at Mouser in Mario 2.
[312:54.14]That's what they are.
[312:54.98]It's been bugging me for, like, 10 minutes.
[313:02.11]You have 100 days.
[313:05.31]I have to fire, at least, I have to fire half the workforce here.
[313:12.75]I'm sorry, I have to.
[313:13.67]Yeah, this is like four or five hundred dollars a day.
[313:22.73]Ugh, who is the least productive?
[313:30.22]That's you.
[313:39.42]You're good.
[313:43.42]Sorry, Gig Bean.
[313:46.70]And you two.
[313:49.68]Alright, I just freed up some money.
[313:52.50]What about essentials?
[313:53.32]Who's working?
[313:54.02]Do we have too many cashiers?
[313:56.24]Do we have too many stock people?
[313:58.10]There are too many stock people.
[313:58.96]We just need one.
[313:59.44]Alright, stock clerk.
[314:05.69]You're worse.
[314:08.35]You're fired.
[314:08.73]I'm sorry.
[314:11.61]We can get rid of one cashier, I think.
[314:17.92]Who's the worst cashier we have?
[314:19.48]That person's in the green.
[314:23.36]That person's staying around for a long time.
[314:25.32]Yeah, I'm sorry, Zimpulse, if you're in the chat.
[314:27.20]I'm really sorry, but yikes, man.
[314:29.33]Like, come on.
[314:29.93]That's not very good.
[314:41.37]You don't have any stock clerks.
[314:44.16]I thought I fired one stock clerk.
[314:55.80]Okay, I freed up some money.
[314:56.90]Speed it up.
[315:02.91]Now I just have to wait till I have $10,000.
[315:04.27]That was the guy you just fired?
[315:12.51]Well, I don't know.
[315:13.25]I pranked him.
[315:17.05]Just kidding!
[315:17.55]You're hired with an extra $5 an hour!
[315:21.44]And I peel off the mustache.
[315:22.66]Oh, it's his undercover boss!
[315:25.95]It's me, your boss.
[315:27.61]I know that this whole show, I mean, I can ask a question about Undercover Boss.
[315:33.92]I feel like if I worked at a place where Undercover Boss was happening, I would know who that person was.
[315:39.88]They have like these weird prosthetics all over them and fake mustaches and they're still the same person talking.
[315:47.85]You don't know what your boss sounds like?
[315:54.41]Okay, so if I walked in to the stream, right?
[315:56.87]If I sat down here, and I turned the stream on, and I had a mustache on, a big wig on, and like a prosthetic chin, and I was going like this, Hey, everybody, I'm new to the channel.
[316:08.47]It's me, Dave.
[316:10.39]I'm a new hire.
[316:12.25]You'd be like, that's fucking Jeremy.
[316:13.33]What are you doing?
[316:13.77]Take that off.
[316:17.23]And I know it's you.
[316:21.57]Oh, yeah, I'm doing the job now.
[316:24.16]Yeah, hey, so what do you think about Jeremy, the boss?
[316:28.06]I heard he's kind of a dickhead.
[316:30.10]What do you think?
[316:33.98]I bet you at some point during the film of that, the dude's mustache is kind of coming off the right side of his face.
[316:39.88]Like there wasn't enough glue on the right side, and it's like, I could really point that out, but I'm not going to.
[316:49.39]Sweat coming down from the mustache is just so uncomfortable to have on for more than an hour.
[317:00.70]Security 2.
[317:01.20]Oh, I have security now.
[317:03.35]Wait.
[317:04.37]How much money?
[317:05.15]How am I losing money still?
[317:07.41]How am I losing money?
[317:08.39]I just fired like five people.
[317:17.16]Fucking theft.
[317:17.88]I swear to God.
[317:18.78]Damn it.
[317:22.58]Security.
[317:24.54]Water dispenser.
[317:25.44]No.
[317:25.80]Security system.
[317:29.16]Guard.
[317:30.44]Where was it called?
[317:35.00]Office desk.
[317:35.86]Auto theft detector.
[317:36.82]Alright, you ain't walking by.
[317:41.04]You're not going to get by with me anymore.
[317:50.51]Good things come to those who wait.
[317:54.89]That's $40,000.
[317:55.37]I can finish the movie there.
[317:56.05]Okay, where do I put this?
[318:00.45]Does it block the entrance?
[318:04.71]Okay, good.
[318:05.23]It works.
[318:07.21]Catch all those thieves.
[318:12.34]No one's fucking getting by.
[318:13.82]Not anymore.
[318:15.36]Good luck.
[318:16.62]You're all under arrest.
[318:22.38]Nobody stole anything?
[318:29.23]Okay, what happens if they get caught?
[318:31.27]Okay, movie thing.
[318:43.20]What just happened to $10,000?
[318:45.70]What the fuck was that?
[318:47.54]How much are these?
[318:51.06]How much are those?
[318:52.00]They're $1,000 each?
[318:52.42]What a ripoff.
[319:02.28]Okay.
[319:21.49]I need a ticket lobby.
[319:23.11]Got one here.
[319:23.57]I need a cashier and I need a linked business.
[319:28.30]What?
[319:34.12]Linked business.
[319:35.28]Ticket lobby.
[319:36.72]Movie theater.
[319:37.24]What does that mean?
[319:47.37]Linked business?
[319:48.35]Is this not open?
[319:54.07]Requires a ticket lobby.
[319:55.11]That's right here.
[319:55.61]Requires a cashier and a linked business.
[320:02.60]They stole the detector.
[320:03.98]Who?
[320:08.14]What?
[320:08.50]No, they didn't.
[320:08.92]That's stealing the detector.
[320:14.37]You gotta connect the movie theater to LinkedIn.
[320:18.61]How do I do this?
[320:23.81]Look at that.
[320:24.33]Look at that sharp decrease.
[320:25.55]Sign.
[320:28.31]Sign.
[320:31.55]I have to link them together somehow?
[320:34.90]Requires a linked business.
[320:46.72]Uh.
[320:48.68]Anybody get that?
[320:58.47]Link, like, in storage.
[320:59.67]Yeah, but... Okay, so manage.
[321:01.97]Ticket lobby.
[321:02.61]There's no... You know, I can hire a cashier.
[321:06.11]Ticket lobby.
[321:06.65]I need two.
[321:12.88]Uh, zone.
[321:13.80]Ticket lobby.
[321:17.94]Connected to the restaurant.
[321:21.49]The restaurant?
[321:22.31]What?
[321:25.74]Movie theater.
[321:27.24]Ah, there we go.
[321:27.72]Link lobby.
[321:29.64]There we are.
[321:30.30]Okay.
[321:31.38]We're ready.
[321:35.06]I don't think we need anything else.
[321:37.94]Let's start showing that movie.
[321:39.34]Come on in.
[321:39.82]Double matinee.
[321:48.19]There are no screens here.
[321:50.65]Uh.
[321:53.07]Do I need screens?
[321:54.97]You must place this on a wall.
[321:56.19]Hold on.
[321:56.57]Select.
[321:59.01]Doesn't say I need anything.
[322:00.57]I think it just goes on the wall?
[322:01.93]How much is a ticket for a movie theater?
[322:19.62]This is on the ground.
[322:22.03]So what you're actually going to see is you're going to get to see Thanos' right arm.
[322:28.27]And zoomed in background.
[322:38.64]There are no cashiers.
[322:39.38]I just hired them.
[322:40.22]They show up tomorrow.
[322:46.22]Why is every movie Infinity War?
[322:48.92]Um.
[322:51.38]Because that's every Marvel movie.
[322:52.78]It was the biggest crossover event in history.
[322:57.53]Dude.
[322:58.53]Fucking Spider-Man is in that movie.
[323:02.55]Understand?
[323:04.11]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[323:04.75]Here we go.
[323:06.55]Alright.
[323:07.21]Coming in to watch a movie.
[323:09.16]What movie are you gonna watch?
[323:11.26]Here we go.
[323:11.96]Oh.
[323:16.53]Fill up the theater, let's do it.
[323:18.75]Show me a quarter of the movie.
[323:23.27]They're facing the wrong way.
[323:27.86]This movie's not even on.
[323:36.03]Okay, why do I feel like this is the depiction of the last FTK stream?
[323:42.13]This is how I feel, right?
[323:43.73]Like, this is like, oh, look, it's this elaborate thing.
[323:46.55]Doesn't this feel like the last FTK stream?
[323:53.88]Finally, we have somebody who wanted to actually watch the movie.
[323:56.70]I'm just hitting him in the eyes.
[323:58.30]This hurts.
[324:01.48]Hey, they're paying for it.
[324:06.46]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, trash, excuse me.
[324:09.51]Let's watch the movie again.
[324:10.87]Oh, they're watching it again?
[324:15.09]This actually will print money, I think.
[324:19.71]Whoa, what?
[324:22.06]Is this person going to puke?
[324:30.92]Oh, I need a janitor in here.
[324:34.28]Oh, okay.
[324:34.86]If every square pixel is going to have trash on it, I wonder what happens.
[324:38.84]Does this person puke?
[324:46.63]What about a concession stand?
[324:55.58]Oh, this lady.
[324:56.40]These people all had groceries.
[325:06.98]He filled bags of groceries and then he went to a movie.
[325:14.02]And then when the movie was over, you dumped the grocery bag onto the ground.
[325:29.00]Dude, dinner and a movie.
[325:30.72]Grocery shopping and a movie.
[325:33.28]The new date, taking the world by storm.
[325:37.05]Okay, actually, somebody has to clean this up.
[325:39.23]For real.

[331:43.98]It's currently... Movies were really in high demand.
[331:45.86]I hit it pretty well.
[331:47.14]Movies are still in high demand.
[331:51.78]Yesterday's sales.
[331:52.40]Look at that.
[331:57.14]Come on and go to the movies already.
[332:04.32]What the fuck is this?

[332:36.18]The trash can is a seat.
[332:37.08]Either or.
[332:37.42]However you want to do it.
[332:38.62]The movie's closed at 6?
[332:43.59]Oh, that's stupid.
[332:54.45]How do I, um, change that?
[332:57.69]Picket lobby.
[332:59.19]Opens.
[333:01.19]9 a.m.
[333:01.49]Who goes to a movie at 9 a.m.?
[333:10.75]Here we go.
[333:12.55]That's better.
[333:13.29]Movies at midnight.
[333:14.93]Matinee.
[333:15.93]11, 10.
[333:16.09]That's good.
[333:16.44]Okay, now the workers have to be doing that too.
[333:22.42]There's just nobody here.
[333:31.12]What is all this going on?
[333:36.82]You start here.
[333:38.23]What is going on down there?
[333:53.39]That's the sails.
[333:57.40]Alright, let's keep going.
[334:01.39]All the parking spaces are there.
[334:04.19]The whole thing with the drugstore, I don't get it.
[334:05.67]Alright, movie theater is made.
[334:07.53]Dude, look at that.
[334:08.87]How?
[334:08.95]That doesn't make any sense.
[334:10.01]I don't understand how this works.
[334:20.02]I've sold like 150 tickets.
[334:21.58]I made $38?
[334:21.74]What's up with that?
[334:34.62]Hopefully that changes.
[334:40.24]Increase the price?
[334:41.22]I don't think you can.
[334:42.52]I think it's just automatic.
[334:47.78]I just realized I've been streaming for five and a half hours.
[334:53.02]This is in a new Vegas arc.
[334:55.88]This is longer than I thought I was going to be here for.
[334:57.85]How come there's nobody where?
[335:02.85]Oh, right, because it doesn't open until later.
[335:05.69]Alright, movie theater is about to open.
[335:10.05]Nobody's stealing anything.
[335:12.97]Movie theater is open.
[335:14.53]In three, two, one.
[335:19.20]Open.
[335:21.26]Come on in.
[335:25.12]Movies are open.
[335:28.91]Really?
[335:29.07]Really?
[335:45.75]Come on, what's with the big showing?
[335:47.11]I need a big showing.
[336:00.62]How is it still $38?
[336:03.86]Oh.
[336:06.86]It's a $60,000 investment, and I've made 38 bucks from it.
[336:09.82]That's not- that can't even be accurate.
[336:37.76]Check the employee hours, shows the sales.
[336:39.58]Okay, we had a big spike.
[336:45.22]18, somewhere around like 15.
[336:46.00]I mean that... There's nobody wants to see a movie.
[336:51.55]What the fuck?
[336:56.03]Spiked to?
[336:59.18]It should be the morning, overnight?
[337:11.18]Okay, we're gonna do shift planning.
[337:15.12]Okay, you- ooh, I didn't know you could do this.
[337:19.60]Take a look at that.
[337:21.67]Now there's infinite overlap.
[337:25.07]We're gonna open at 4, and we're gonna close at midnight, at 21.
[337:28.93]Infinite.
[337:29.41]We open at 4.
[337:33.78]We open at 6.
[337:41.68]We close at 23.
[337:45.39]There you go.
[337:48.93]Now we got a lot of time here.
[337:56.64]Fill it up.
[338:03.68]Imagine seeing a movie at 6 in the morning.
[338:05.45]Yeah, I would not.
[338:10.50]Who watches movies at 6 a.m.?
[338:12.48]I don't know, but it's available if you want to.
[338:14.68]See?
[338:20.70]We got a sale.
[338:21.90]This person.
[338:26.56]Buy tour 777 in the chat.
[338:31.89]You're the one that's awake at 6 a.m.
[338:33.17]going to the movies.
[338:41.65]Oh, dude, hold on.
[338:45.41]Yo, what happened?
[338:48.67]What?
[338:49.13]What happened?
[338:49.81]Why'd you leave?
[338:59.93]One guy in the whole parking lot.
[339:02.66]It's an early bird.
[339:03.52]I should make a diner.
[339:12.57]Okay, here comes the crowd.
[339:13.91]Here comes the lunch crowd.
[339:21.30]Okay, the profit stuff doesn't make any sense.
[339:24.18]I had this open for almost six hours.
[339:29.25]We've made way more than $3,000 or $4,000 here.
[339:31.09]Oh, security too.

[340:10.84]How do I hire a security guard?
[340:29.80]I can't make a security guard?
[340:30.70]Do I need a security area?
[340:34.29]Like a building for them?
[340:38.53]Security center.
[340:39.45]Oh, man.
[340:40.15]Okay.
[340:40.83]Just a little one.
[340:43.97]Just a tiny one.

[342:02.38]Is there like a couch?
[342:10.58]He's one person?
[342:12.06]Yeah, I know.
[342:15.04]I'll get the job done.
[342:16.32]Like, the stream's over in like 10 minutes anyways.
[342:18.26]I don't care.
[342:22.04]Where are they?
[342:22.52]Something's wrong.
[342:31.67]Wait, what?
[342:42.86]This is where all the money is made in here.
[342:48.11]Just right here.

[342:56.86]Left click to extend patrol.
[342:59.56]Oh, you have to actually draw this shit.
[343:01.90]Okay.
[343:03.72]There.
[343:06.77]That's good.
[343:13.96]So do it.
[343:18.00]How does he work?
[343:20.20]Why is it such a low battery?
[343:29.49]Is he working?
[343:39.95]I just want to see him.
[343:41.77]Make sure they're doing their job.
[343:45.22]Yeah, I just wanted to walk around here.
[343:47.52]No more theft.
[343:49.18]I'm not going to get robbed anymore.
[343:52.99]This game is pretty fun.
[343:54.71]I really like this.
[343:55.35]It's really fun.
[343:57.01]Now, imagine if you had all this.
[344:01.59]Here's the thing, though.
[344:02.17]If you're going to do sandbox mode, give yourself like $50 million.
[344:06.39]Because it's very expensive.
[344:09.70]And we didn't even crash the surface over here.
[344:22.43]Alright, I wanna see him.
[344:23.89]And then I'm gonna call it here.
[344:28.05]I'll call it here.
[344:29.25]I gotta get up.
[344:36.40]Mall Fortress.
[344:40.12]This is definitely made more than 200 bucks.
[344:41.78]That's lagging data.
[344:42.77]That's like two months behind.
[344:55.17]There is.
[344:58.50]Don't you have a route?
[345:04.04]Excuse me.
[345:13.45]Go out.
[345:13.87]Go out the door, dude.
[345:18.01]Go out the door and do your work.
[345:25.01]can't cross the parking lot why not yes he can fire me from this hellhole you need to click the route oh
[345:58.47]Okay.
[345:59.49]Go for it.
[346:12.16]Do it, man!
[346:14.56]Okay, go!
[346:25.49]I just gave him like the dog zoomies.
[346:27.53]That's all I did.
[346:29.61]Is he catching anybody?
[346:30.45]Oh, he's on a scooter.
[346:38.08]Arrest somebody.
[346:55.50]Pokémon AI?
[346:58.60]No, not Pokémon AI.
[346:59.74]This guy's doing this.
[347:02.68]He's just circling in the grass over and over again because he wants to do shiny hunting.
[347:05.95]All of a sudden, it's just going to go... It'll be here for like the next six weeks.
[347:27.71]The loan, the loan, the loan.
[347:30.61]I have so much time to pay that loan.
[347:32.15]I'm fine.
[347:32.45]I have a hundred days to pay it.
[347:40.12]I think this is pretty cool.
[347:41.82]Look at it.
[347:42.10]We got a restaurant.
[347:44.08]We've got a security spot.
[347:46.82]We've got a bar.
[347:48.80]There's a movie theater.
[347:51.12]There's like a shoe store.
[347:54.29]There's a grocery store, fresh bread.
[347:58.23]Ooze, beer.
[347:59.01]Hey, what is this?
[348:05.06]Place for people to fucking just slack off.
[348:08.68]A bar and a theater that no one go to.
[348:14.74]Well, just wait until there's another expansion this way.
[348:16.92]Like another big thing.
[348:21.16]I'm making money.
[348:21.88]I'm not making a lot of money, but I'm making money.
[348:27.58]Alright, I'm out of here.
[348:28.92]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[348:30.82]Tomorrow we're going to... That's a mystery.
[348:33.61]I don't know.
[348:40.01]There are a few... I didn't think I was going to play this for six hours.
[348:48.18]Yeah, it'll be a mystery stream tomorrow.
[348:50.90]I'll find something.
[348:54.51]This week is mystery streams, that's for sure.
[348:56.91]Next week is horror stuff.
[348:57.89]We're going to do VR stuff too.
[349:01.39]This is a lot of fun though.
[349:04.50]I feel the same way about this that I felt about something like City Skylines.
[349:08.34]If you actually understand design and architecture, I mean, this is fun to do.
[349:13.44]Fun to make your own little storefronts.
[349:18.12]I give this a stamp of I think it's good.
[349:22.06]Recommended.
[349:26.52]Fun little game.
[349:28.90]But we'll see.
[349:29.48]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[349:30.84]Let's do the credits.
[349:31.70]There was a shitload of community subs earlier.
[349:33.26]From when I, you know, said the word Twitch Prime.
[349:41.87]It was a lot of them.
[349:45.17]Take a look.
[349:48.73]Thanks all of you again.
[349:50.59]Oh, you just said it again.
[349:57.41]Uh, actually, let me see.
[349:58.25]We had Detroit, thanks for the five subs.
[350:00.75]MedallionOWO, thanks for five.
[350:02.77]Ten community subs from The Drum Major on Twitch, thanks for the ten subs.
[350:08.17]Admiral Green, thanks for five subs right now.
[350:10.00]I just said it, you're right.
[350:12.34]This is going by pretty quickly.
[350:13.28]This is a fast scan.
[350:16.68]Did we get raided?
[350:19.46]When?
[350:20.62]We did?
[350:24.22]Did we?
[350:28.01]I don't see a raid.
[350:32.23]Remember, you are a stinko.
[350:34.37]Sometimes.
[350:36.23]Oh my god, a human.
[350:37.71]Thanks to the five- I like your name.
[350:39.33]Thanks to the five subs, dude.
[350:43.19]Jimmy Kimmel raid.
[350:44.15]Okay, if Jimmy Kimmel raided the stream, that means it'd probably be like 200,000 concurrent viewers, and I would have to keep the stream going.
[350:56.63]No, you know what?
[350:57.29]I'd probably just leave.
[350:59.95]That stream's over.
[351:04.88]200,000 people raid!
[351:05.76]I'd be like, guys, I'm leaving.
[351:08.56]Come tomorrow if you want to hang out.
[351:12.56]That's toxic.
[351:14.75]Is it?
[351:19.09]I'd be like, thanks so much.
[351:20.73]Thanks so much, Mr. Kimmel for the raid.
[351:22.07]Welcome, everybody.
[351:22.67]My name's Jerma.
[351:23.55]I'm a video game guy, and I, like, play games.
[351:25.43]We do all kinds of crazy, quirky stuff here.
[351:27.41]If you like crazy stuff, go ahead and follow.
[351:29.41]But I'm done.
[351:30.09]I'm not streaming.
[351:30.67]I said I was going to stream for six hours.
[351:31.83]I'm not going to go any further.
[351:33.11]Thank you.
[351:34.06]Thank you so much.
[351:34.98]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[351:35.84]Show up tomorrow.
[351:40.44]Thanks for the raid.
[351:41.08]Raiders!
[351:47.76]Late night voice.
[351:52.50]Why am I getting ha-ha'd?
[351:53.90]You're ha-ha-ing that?
[351:54.76]Come on.
[351:57.34]Do eight more minutes for six full hours.
[352:00.90]Eh.
[352:03.34]Eh.
[352:09.38]Nah.
[352:10.94]Nah, whatever.
[352:12.40]It's okay.
[352:12.80]I don't need to do that.
[352:18.22]Finish in exactly six hours.
[352:19.57]We'll get pretty close.
[352:20.41]Let's see.
[352:28.53]Thanks for all the subs though, guys.
[352:30.59]There were like a couple hundred today.
[352:33.39]Thanks.
[352:35.15]Finish at 5.59.59.
[352:36.09]You know it's really hard to do that because when I hit end stream, I think it actually takes a few seconds for it to actually turn the stream off.
[352:47.83]Oh, by the way, also something that I forgot and I didn't really know.
[352:52.80]This is dead serious.
[352:54.72]I mean this with all of my heart.
[352:56.98]This is not me making something up.
[353:00.08]The ow thing, when the janitor walks over and bumps into the thing and you guys say ow, I thought for the last two straight years that you were talking about like, oh, he bumped into me, he bumped into my face.
[353:14.16]I didn't know there was a loud sound on it.
[353:20.36]I did not know that until three days ago.
[353:31.33]I thought it was because here he comes.
[353:33.45]Oh, he bumped you.
[353:34.95]I did not know there was even a sound effect on it.
[353:48.50]That's not why.
[353:49.26]I was doing it because of the bump, not the sound.
[353:52.84]But wait, is there a sound?
[353:54.60]How come I don't hear the sound when he does it?
[353:57.52]Hold on.
[353:58.41]I'm curious.
[354:02.79]How come there was no sound there?
[354:09.15]There's no sound there.
[354:13.83]It was?
[354:14.23]How come I didn't hear it?
[354:19.47]There is sound.
[354:20.01]It's like a wet slap.
[354:26.80]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[354:28.50]Thanks for watching, as always.
[354:29.98]See you guys soon.
[354:34.33]Starting probably around the same time, probably around 1 o'clock Pacific.
[354:36.57]Have a great rest of your night.
[354:42.04]Take care, guys.
[354:42.50]See you soon.
[354:53.18]Can I get it?
[354:53.60]Can I get it?
[354:54.04]Can I get it?
[354:54.48]Can I get 5, 5, 5, 5, 5?
[354:55.74]I'm gonna try.
[354:57.49]I'm gonna go for it.
[355:01.07]Here we go.
[355:01.33]What do you think?
[355:02.29]Two, three seconds?
[355:05.06]Early close, 5-5-5-5-5.
[355:06.24]Come on.
[355:10.57]I should probably do it like one or two seconds early.
[355:16.63]Around like 5-5-5-5-3.
[355:17.31]Or 5-5-5-5-4.
[355:17.53]I'm going to do it on 5-5-5-5-4.
[355:18.43]Here we go.
[355:19.59]See you later.
[355:20.05]We're going to do it at 5-5-5-5-4.
[355:36.18]See you tomorrow, guys.
