[ve:61.1.100]

[00:04.39]Okay, what's up everybody?
[00:06.29]Welcome back.
[00:06.83]Sorry for that slightly longer than expected break.
[00:10.41]We were mashing our brains together to come up with exactly what is going to happen for Dota Fortress 2, which is next.
[00:17.64]I am Seabear, back from my little two-hour jaunt out in the land of St.
[00:22.60]Paul, Minnesota.
[00:23.63]What a beautiful day.
[00:24.55]And look at that graphics.
[00:25.95]Unbelievable.
[00:26.63]That looks awesome.
[00:27.91]I think Lang and a few others have put
[00:30.05]hundreds of hours of work into this, and it looks fantastic.
[00:34.14]So great job, everybody.
[00:35.60]I'm being joined by my ginger life partner, Salomancer.
[00:39.85]What's up, buddy?
[00:41.33]I'm doing great, man.
[00:42.45]I kicked this off yesterday with the Highlander EU versus NA, and now it looks like I'm actually taking this out with Dota Fortress.
[00:49.08]It's going to be a great time.
[00:50.29]This is a great time.
[00:51.07]And not only are those graphics hilarious, but they also have the appropriate names.
[00:55.31]The names are kind of hard to read.
[00:56.51]I have my stream on Medium.
[00:58.14]I've actually full screened it to try to help out.
[01:01.68]Yeah, we have Jerma's team versus Stirr's team.
[01:05.03]And boy, the rivalry is real.
[01:06.51]I can feel it after that awesome video that Stirr made Jerma.
[01:11.24]Did you see that, Sal?
[01:13.51]You know, I actually have not seen that one yet.
[01:16.17]I'll tell you what, though.
[01:16.85]This reminds me of... I haven't played Dota.
[01:19.90]I feel bad.
[01:20.92]This actually reminds me a lot of Smash Brothers, just the way everybody's moving around and everybody looks hilarious.
[01:26.11]Any fighting game in general, this is an awesome graphic.
[01:28.77]So props to whoever did this one.
[01:30.55]Yeah, so how this is going to work for all of you who have never watched Dota before, we're going to have Star and Jerm.
[01:34.73]I believe Star is going to be picking slash banning first.
[01:38.08]And they're going to go ahead and ban out, not classes or not, you know, unlocks or anything.
[01:44.08]They're actually going to ban the players.
[01:45.38]Every single one of these players, many of whom are legends of our game, like Oplad or Tyrone, Sizer, they are eligible to be picked or banned.
[01:55.35]So if Jerm wants to ban out Sizer, well...
[01:58.16]You know what?
[01:58.80]You certainly can.
[01:59.56]And Sizer will not be able to play.
[02:00.92]I think we're going to do three of these, at least two.
[02:03.39]So why don't we stop talking about it and get to the picking.
[02:06.25]I believe we are just going to enter straight into it with Ster's first ban, unless there's anything else, Sean or Lang, that you would like me to clarify.
[02:16.42]You got it.
[02:17.32]Ster, are you here?
[02:18.32]Yeah, I'm ready to do this.
[02:19.84]This is a little bit funky, but we're going to get it all worked out.
[02:23.25]Also, the other rule I don't think they mentioned is you need to have an auth class on your team, which would be a sniper, engineer, spy, heavy, or pyro.
[02:31.82]Normally not on a sixes team, but that's why they're on the list because we need them.
[02:35.87]And we are doing sixes.
[02:37.91]Also, I didn't say that.
[02:38.75]Six on six.
[02:41.88]This is awesome, by the way.
[02:44.36]It is going to be first map CP Badlands, so maybe consider that during your picks.
[02:49.19]CP Badlands.
[02:50.09]So I have the first ban.
[02:51.45]If I remember correctly what Sean said, that means Jerma is going to have the first pick, so I'm going to want to ban Othello.
[02:57.70]I do not want him to pick.
[03:01.41]And I'm going to throw Clockwork out.
[03:05.35]Alright, so Clockwork has been eliminated.
[03:07.87]Boom.
[03:08.77]And now, real quick, sorry, before Jerma picks, just to clarify, are they, are these players, like, is Tyrone only playing Soldier, or is Clockwork only Scout?
[03:17.84]Yes, they are not allowed to change class.
[03:19.40]If you're picked in a certain class, you have to stay in a certain class.
[03:22.11]But if Clockwork were to have been picked as Demo, even though he's a Scout main or whatever, like, he could have been picked on any class.
[03:27.57]Any player can be picked on any class, right?
[03:30.29]No, as far as I understand.
[03:32.48]They have to play their roles, except for the odd class.
[03:35.58]That's why they have the cute icons of the class.
[03:38.00]Okay, that makes sense.
[03:38.66]Alright, I'm done.
[03:39.59]Let's ban all of the demos.
[03:42.95]Okay, Jerma, it's your turn to ban, I believe.
[03:46.58]Alright, let's take a look.
[03:51.14]Hmm.
[03:51.84]A lot of good names, a lot of big-timers here.
[03:53.89]Sorry, can you open that chat, by the way?
[03:58.91]I'm gonna have to ban Seagull.
[04:01.64]Can you invite me?
[04:02.24]I'm sorry.
[04:03.18]Aw, Seagull is gone.
[04:04.56]He's been removed.
[04:06.34]Eliminated!
[04:08.21]Which will bring us to Star's second ban.
[04:12.35]I haven't exactly thought this one through.
[04:14.35]I'm gonna take a look down at the off classes and...
[04:20.29]You know what?
[04:21.26]You know what?
[04:22.32]O played.
[04:24.00]O played your band.
[04:25.90]Very questionable, but no.
[04:28.36]You're done.
[04:29.02]I'm sorry.
[04:29.47]Alright, Sam Lingold, gaming legend, you are out.
[04:34.31]That's too bad.
[04:34.89]I was looking forward to casting your game.
[04:37.63]But yeah, you've been removed.
[04:39.32]Maybe next time.
[04:40.26]This is more than one game going on right here.
[04:43.18]This is true.
[04:44.48]Okay, Jerma, you have the last band before we start picking here.
[04:48.48]Alright, this is the toughest decision of my entire life.
[04:59.77]I'm banning Grape.
[05:01.83]I saw some of the crazy stuff he was doing in the streams.
[05:04.51]Alright, Grape has been eliminated.
[05:05.70]See you later, nerd.
[05:07.40]Okay, so I believe that means Jerma, if I'm not mistaken, gets the first pick.
[05:14.03]So Jerma, which one of these lovely nerds would you like on your team?
[05:17.56]Oh, first pick, I can tell you right now, it's going to Stabby, baby.
[05:22.21]The upset of upsets, Stabby Stabby.
[05:25.31]Sleeper pick.
[05:27.88]I didn't see that coming.
[05:28.86]You just spun my whole world around on that one.
[05:31.78]Get turned around.
[05:33.18]Is he on his boat, ladies and gentlemen?
[05:35.19]Stabby Stabby is the first member of Jerma's team.
[05:39.09]Alright, puts a wrench right into the machine there.
[05:41.48]What's the counter pick for this Jerm?
[05:47.58]Here's the question.
[05:48.11]Do I want to win?
[05:50.64]Or do I want to see a good show?
[05:53.31]Do you want to counter the pick?
[05:54.63]I mean, there's some pyros to pick from there.
[05:56.23]He just got a spy first pick.
[05:57.95]He's only going to have one off-class.
[05:59.57]He ain't picking another one.
[06:01.09]I got all day to pick an off-class.
[06:04.20]And, you know, you picked a weird first one.
[06:07.12]I'm just going to say I really want to see Tag play, so I'm getting Tag.
[06:10.47]He's going to fire all day.
[06:11.99]I need him.
[06:12.95]Tag has finally been picked to play TF2.
[06:15.82]That's interesting.
[06:16.90]Oh, big mistake.
[06:18.83]Big mistake.
[06:19.57]You left.
[06:20.83]It's my pick, right?
[06:21.97]Yeah, it's your pick, buddy.
[06:23.65]Taking Mela.
[06:26.46]Actually, no, that's great.
[06:28.24]That's great.
[06:28.90]We're going to have the two roamers going at it.
[06:31.21]You know, that's perfect because the fire is burning in tag.
[06:33.91]Look at his icon.
[06:34.59]Look at that hat.
[06:36.03]He wants to take Mela down after what happened today.
[06:39.06]I think that it's going to be a grudge match.
[06:40.92]Maybe we can even get them to do, what's that little duel thing?
[06:43.82]That'd be awesome.
[06:45.09]Alright, Star, I believe it is your turn.
[06:48.39]Duatna.
[06:49.67]Duatna.
[06:51.70]Done playing games.
[06:53.24]The demo has been selected.
[06:54.22]Okay, so now we're going to go back to the banning phase.
[06:55.90]And Sean, I believe we're banning out one each at this point, or do you want to do two bans now?
[07:02.82]No answer?
[07:03.72]Sorry, sorry, we're doing four bans total, so just the one ban, I think.
[07:06.54]Okay, so, um, does Ster, do you get to ban first, then?
[07:10.17]Or are we switching it up?
[07:13.66]Uh, Jerma ban first.
[07:15.22]Okay, Jerma ban first, and then Ster picks.
[07:16.86]Okay, yeah.
[07:18.20]And Ster bans, and then picks right after.
[07:20.23]We'll figure it out.
[07:20.89]Alright, Jerma, you're up to ban a nerd.
[07:24.44]Alright, this is where it gets tricky.
[07:30.29]This really is an intimidating thing.
[07:32.79]All these people.
[07:33.95]Huey Lewis up there is just staring at me like, you've made the wrong choice.
[07:40.08]When you make the right choice, it actually turns into a happy pyro.
[07:43.82]I know, right next to him.
[07:44.62]They're both looking at him, too.
[07:47.21]He's badass.
[07:50.69]I'm gonna... I've got two in my mind right now.
[07:55.23]And I think the one I'm gonna have to pick is... I'm gonna say Power.
[08:00.31]What kind of team are you putting together?
[08:04.66]The best.
[08:05.46]These are dream teams right now.
[08:07.14]In a weird way.
[08:09.50]Wait, you got banned, right?
[08:11.64]That was a ban.
[08:13.12]Alright, so now Jermyn gets a pick.
[08:16.29]I don't.
[08:16.55]Star gets the ban.
[08:17.41]I get a ban.
[08:18.59]Oh, I thought he already banned.
[08:20.31]I panicked.
[08:22.47]I'm gonna drop out.
[08:28.60]I think I'm gonna have to drop...
[08:33.96]Zalox.
[08:35.60]Good choice, Zalox.
[08:36.74]You are cut, gone.
[08:39.61]And before we get to the pick, I just want to say our guy TMA, who's been donating all thing long, all tip of the hats long, also donated $250 in the recent 15 minutes or so.
[08:52.98]So TMA has been huge.
[08:54.33]So thank you so much, my friend.
[08:55.85]We have a couple other donations I'll get to as well, but let's continue picking.
[08:59.51]I believe we are going to let Star pick first now.
[09:04.39]First pick.
[09:07.19]I wasn't prepared for that.
[09:08.37]I was expecting a Jerma.
[09:10.41]I'm gonna go with Shrugger.
[09:14.68]Okay, Shrugger's been picked.
[09:16.50]What a mean face on that guy right now, too.
[09:18.91]Also, huge, huge shoutout to the production on this.
[09:21.87]This is insane.
[09:24.30]That's pretty awesome.
[09:25.38]Alright, Jerma, you get to pick now.
[09:28.78]Alright.
[09:31.17]You know what this reminds me of?
[09:31.97]You guys ever play Guess Who?
[09:34.96]No, I've never played that game.
[09:37.47]It's a great game.
[09:39.17]Actually, the best way to play that game is to play offensive Guess Who, where you just try as hard as you can to say things that make the other guy laugh.
[09:51.98]I'm not laughing.
[09:53.50]I'm sorry, I tried.
[09:55.78]I'm sorry, I was paying attention to picking.
[09:58.07]I said, I love Guess Who, and then I looked over here, like, who do I want now?
[10:03.94]Oh, Connect Four is great, too.
[10:07.48]Alright, Ruin.
[10:08.58]I'm taking Ruin.
[10:09.75]Oh my goodness.
[10:10.49]Okay, so Ruin has been picked.
[10:13.63]That's an awesome pick.
[10:16.35]And I think we're going to do... Right back over to me, or are we doing another ban?
[10:20.02]Another pick.
[10:21.90]I think I'm just going to go with the real obvious one.
[10:23.72]You picked Stabby.
[10:25.07]I don't think you should go with a spy first, because I'm going to grab Huey Lewis on this one.
[10:29.85]Huey Lewis, the pyro expert, has been picked.
[10:33.08]Trumped.
[10:34.63]And go ahead, Mr. Jerma.
[10:51.33]We're looking for a... I'm going to take Shade.
[10:56.32]Taking Shade.
[10:58.78]Okay, so now we're going to go back to the ban phase.
[11:01.77]Who banned first last time?
[11:03.49]Was it Jermo?
[11:04.75]So Star, you banned first again here?
[11:07.35]Um, alright.
[11:09.26]Let's take a gander over here.
[11:10.72]I want to do a quick shoutout while you're taking a gander.
[11:15.31]Shade actually messaged me today.
[11:16.43]He's going to start a weekly web show about competitive TF2 soon.
[11:19.37]It's called The Back Cap, I believe.
[11:21.50]So look out for details on that.
[11:23.06]Maybe if Shade's in chat, I can get a link spammed to the Twitch chat.
[11:28.35]He's starting a web show about Competitive 2, too.
[11:32.40]Since Seabear and Fully Charged is left to the Earth.
[11:35.02]Hmm, interesting concept.
[11:36.32]I'd like to know more.
[11:38.63]That's good.
[11:39.17]It's a good choice for someone to do.
[11:40.67]Alright, who's picking?
[11:41.33]Sorry, Star is picking?
[11:42.75]Star is banning.
[11:43.41]Banning.
[11:44.24]This is very complicated.
[11:45.62]I feel like a bad person.
[11:47.26]Anybody I ban is just...
[11:49.73]I don't want you to play.
[11:50.97]There's something I just really don't like about you.
[11:53.21]I feel like an awful person.
[11:54.77]I don't know what to do.
[11:56.11]I don't like Sizer.
[12:03.50]Honestly, I just really don't like Sizer.
[12:05.28]That's the only one here where I won't feel like a bad person.
[12:08.04]Is it because he's from Canada?
[12:10.91]There's many reasons.
[12:12.31]That's one on top of just thousands.
[12:14.35]That's the cherry on top.
[12:15.53]Alright, so Sizer's gone.
[12:16.55]Jerma, who else would you like to ban?
[12:20.62]I'm taking a look here.
[12:23.51]I think Star is going to need a medic soon here.
[12:26.57]If you want to ban any certain medics.
[12:28.09]Yeah, that's what I'm looking at right now.
[12:36.97]I don't know.
[12:37.73]One of them's got a big grin.
[12:39.55]I don't trust him.
[12:40.09]I'm banning the Fragile.
[12:42.51]Catface gone.
[12:44.00]Okay, so now we're down to the last picks.
[12:46.76]Jerma, you actually get the first pick here for this final two picks.
[12:51.81]Okay.
[12:59.34]I need... Let's get a demo.
[13:04.83]Alright, let's go with Pure.
[13:06.02]Right.
[13:09.00]The godfather of TF2 has been selected on demo for Jerma's team.
[13:13.35]Star!
[13:15.47]I'm going with Blaze.
[13:20.65]Good choice.
[13:21.62]Jerma, who's going to round out your six?
[13:28.80]Pick a heavy.
[13:31.19]You know what?
[13:32.21]He's getting in your head.
[13:34.97]Don't let him in.
[13:36.33]Don't let me in your head right now.
[13:37.81]I feel like you're about to make a drastic Jerma.
[13:41.02]I think...
[13:43.23]I think we're going to see a little bit of a show here.
[13:44.97]Satan has been picked.
[13:50.26]What a gamer.
[13:51.58]What a gamer.
[13:52.22]I actually don't know Satan.
[13:53.34]I thought you were joking, but there's a person named Satan.
[13:55.48]No, it's Satan.
[13:56.74]Pyro.
[13:57.45]Two Pyros.
[13:58.27]Just to make Ster angry.
[13:59.73]Alright, Ster, who's your sixth?
[14:01.95]Probably going to need a Medic.
[14:03.55]I don't know if I want to go up against the double Pyro.
[14:06.38]And I'm going to put my faith in Endust.
[14:13.57]Alright, so Indus has been selected.
[14:15.39]Alright, so we have our two teams.
[14:18.80]Sean, I think you've been moving people and stuff.
[14:20.86]Actually, we're in the server here, in the Source TV.
[14:24.19]So we're pretty much ready to go.
[14:25.25]Yeah, before this goes, I need a prediction from you.
[14:28.67]Just a quick explanation of what you think is even going on here.
[14:31.52]I have no idea.
[14:33.67]You might think that your team or Ster's team is the advantage because of having a more traditional lineup.
[14:38.80]But I got to say, the extra pyro, if Satan is as good as, I mean, a man wielding fire, I actually like the pyro play, especially on Badlands.
[14:48.51]A lot of crafty routes he can take.
[14:52.00]I don't know.
[14:52.28]I'm...
[14:52.38]Very curious.
[14:53.38]All 12 players are very good, so we'll have to see.
[14:56.31]I'm curious to see how Team Jerma is going to handle capping the Spire at any point.
[15:01.21]Yeah, that's true.
[15:01.95]Maybe you can do the Bloodsire and borrow a Rocket Jump.
[15:05.84]Do we have any weapon bans, ESCA or anything?
[15:07.88]Maybe they can get up there with the Detonator.
[15:10.60]I don't know.
[15:12.05]I'm guessing we're probably playing with ESCA bans.
[15:14.09]I hope not.
[15:14.86]Before we end up going live here, I do have more donations I was going to read out here.
[15:19.22]I got a $200 donation from Dodagon.
[15:24.03]Dodagon.
[15:24.73]Dodagon.
[15:26.11]Sorry if I butchered that.
[15:27.24]Keep up the good work, guys.
[15:28.34]It's a $200 donation.
[15:29.92]Thank you very, very much.
[15:33.34]I got a $15 donation from GoodLuckSesco.
[15:36.05]Jeremy versus Star.
[15:37.57]Jeremy versus Star.
[15:38.39]Everybody wants to see this happen.
[15:39.33]It already happened yesterday.
[15:40.60]And I don't think everyone ever wants to see it happen again.
[15:45.01]Not the best MGE round that we've ever seen here.
[15:47.40]$60 donation from NJA, who said something, but my browser just crashed.
[15:55.00]So I'm sorry, NJA, but thank you so much for your donation.
[15:57.73]Alright, Sal.
[15:58.89]What are you feeling?
[15:59.35]Who do you think is going to win this?
[16:02.15]Wait, what?
[16:02.57]Is stuff happening?
[16:03.93]Yeah, who do you think is going to win, man?
[16:08.38]The team that can cap Spire.
[16:10.56]So not Jerma's team.
[16:12.16]Yeah.
[16:14.14]I believe that we're playing this... It's fair enough.
[16:19.33]It's hard to win without it.
[16:20.89]Duatna's gonna have to get up there.
[16:23.23]Oh no, Duatna's on Sturer's team.
[16:25.53]Okay, so it looks like... I think Pure will be the one who's trying to jump forward if he stays alive at mid-fights, which, you know, he can do.
[16:31.20]He knows how to do that.
[16:32.26]We'll see what Stabby Stabby likes to do, running around with the Pyro hard counter as Spy.
[16:37.30]He is forced to stay Spy the entire time, too, so that'll be an interesting... You know what?
[16:42.07]I'm thinking it's gonna be Ambassador headshots all the way.
[16:44.11]I was thinking the exact same thing.
[16:45.57]I mean, you know, maybe trying to switch it up a little bit, but when you're playing 6v6 and you know there's a spy all the time, it's going to be a lot harder.
[16:53.22]Stabby is pretty good, but it's going to have to be magical for some of these to work out here.
[16:57.55]So, yeah, it looks like the red side is going to be Jerma's side, and the blue side is going to be Ster's side.
[17:04.27]And Chat, what do you think?
[17:05.87]You saw the teams?
[17:06.90]You saw the awesome graphics being pulled into the various teams?
[17:10.68]What do you think is going to win?
[17:12.06]Ster or Jerma?
[17:14.79]Miller up.
[17:17.99]Sal, I don't know if you saw the total.
[17:20.60]The last time, I think you did.
[17:21.50]You kicked your shoe.
[17:22.42]You're bookending our cast or our marathon here.
[17:26.21]When you started, it was like $10,000.
[17:27.93]We're almost at $90,000.
[17:29.93]That's right.
[17:30.99]Can you believe it?
[17:31.69]That's right.
[17:32.96]You know what?
[17:33.52]Actually, when I was casting with Admirable that first game, I set a target of 100.
[17:37.26]And I know that we're only a couple hours away.
[17:39.64]So maybe it won't happen, guys.
[17:41.89]But I have my hope.
[17:44.46]I don't know, man.
[17:46.68]$100,000 stream?
[17:48.62]What do you think?
[17:49.18]Is that possible?
[17:50.34]You guys have been so generous all throughout the last 32 hours.
[17:55.09]I think it's doable.
[17:56.07]I was really skeptical.
[17:57.24]I set my goal this morning at 72, which would have doubled our total from last year, which was 36,000.
[18:04.27]And we are so much...
[18:06.63]further than 72 or 15 000 and change over that's unbelievable so keep the donations coming um I don't know if I'll have so much time or any any time at all to read that during this uh which promises to be a ridiculous 6v6 display here but I'll do my best so thank you very much um and I think we're ready we have 12 in the server sal I'm pumped we do and okay interesting to note uh both mayla and tag have gone direct hit apparently they really don't like pyros
[18:33.26]Yeah, I've seen reflections of those before.
[18:36.79]I think they're just going direct tech because they really, really want to kill each other.
[18:40.97]You know what?
[18:41.46]I ducked into the chat here just a second ago to get some pregame strategizing from the team.
[18:45.84]And Huey Lewis was lamenting the fact that there is one soldier and he is running the DH.
[18:50.67]So I'm not sure what he's going to be reflecting.
[18:53.81]That is true.
[18:54.49]Yeah.
[18:55.38]Maybe he'll... Hewless has got some awesome reaction time, Sean.
[18:59.36]Maybe he'll just get that reflect and shoot the uber rocket right back at him.
[19:04.75]Sean, who do you think is going to win this?
[19:08.38]Let's see.
[19:08.94]I think Team Jerma looks good.
[19:13.80]You like Team Jerma?
[19:14.57]You got a little stabby, stabby love?
[19:16.32]Yeah, I was questioning the stabby pick.
[19:18.81]It's kind of a wild card, but I'm looking at the rosters Shade, Ruin, Pure, Maela.
[19:23.68]Yeah, I'm good on Blaze and Tag.
[19:25.04]That's a killer soldier combo.
[19:27.65]It's going to be a good game.
[19:28.47]I pick the teams, and I would actually really like to see Jerma's team win, just because it's really awkward.
[19:35.49]Oh, and we are going to be able to do the War Room, which we're not going to be listening for super awesome comms, but rather maybe some trash talk between Tag and Mela.
[19:46.77]I mean, we could just have Lang put his mic button down for Mela's shit talk, but we'll see.
[19:52.90]So that'll be fun.
[19:53.62]We'll throw that in there.
[19:54.66]But we're ready to go, Sean.
[19:55.56]I don't know if you want to tell these nerds to go ahead and get going.
[19:57.53]Yeah, we'll let them ready up.
[19:58.63]Alright, sweet.
[20:00.45]And I believe this is going to be similar to the rules that we played with earlier today for the 6v6.
[20:04.82]Display, which will be European rules.
[20:07.77]I think winner by five or who's ever winning at the end of 30 minutes.
[20:13.87]So Seabear, what's been your favorite event of the entire tip of the hats that you've seen?
[20:18.43]Yeah, I had to leave during the jump section.
[20:20.77]I really wanted to see that.
[20:21.76]It's my passion for TF2 now at this point.
[20:24.10]I love jumping and the lineup they had, they were just tearing up one of the harder jump maps when I left.
[20:29.50]So I wanted to see that.
[20:30.65]I'll have to do the VOD when I have a chance.
[20:33.19]That I saw, you know, I really enjoyed the ulti duo.
[20:38.45]competition.
[20:39.55]It probably has the single most epic moment, I think, that we saw during the course of the spree.
[20:45.36]And I gotta be honest, listening to Jerma and Styr and their banter and Styr and Maela's casts made me laugh to the point where I really couldn't listen anymore, especially during the b-ball.
[20:56.31]The things they were saying were just cracking me up.
[20:58.07]So, I don't know.
[20:58.97]It kind of makes you think to yourself, like, why aren't I that funny?
[21:01.54]I know!
[21:01.96]Well, maybe not you.
[21:03.92]I know I feel that way.
[21:05.42]I have hundreds of thousands of people on my YouTube.
[21:06.82]No, they are.
[21:07.68]That was really fun.
[21:08.94]I don't know.
[21:09.43]The whole thing has been a great success.
[21:11.19]I was nervous about the amount of pubbing that was involved, but really those segments became some of the best.
[21:17.50]Just the banter and fun TF2.
[21:19.31]I mean, that's really what this game is to most people.
[21:20.99]It's just a lot of fun.
[21:22.23]And we are going to go live, Mr. Salamansa.
[21:24.88]Are you ready?
[21:26.02]Quick shoutout before you guys begin casting.
[21:28.04]We need to give a shoutout to AngryStockPuppet who did the Source Filmmaker animations for the pick screen.
[21:32.37]Okay.
[21:33.23]Yeah, that was awesome, man.
[21:34.17]Like, seriously, the chat when they saw that blew up.
[21:37.41]They were just all about that.
[21:38.65]That was awesome.
[21:39.79]Very, very cool.
[21:40.68]I heard of hours, hours of work.
[21:42.46]Like, dozens of hours.
[21:43.94]So awesome.
[21:44.60]We're at the first mid here.
[21:45.90]Both soldiers are running the direct hit, which indeed brings a tear to my eye.
[21:48.81]But Mayla and Tag have already found each other.
[21:51.07]They're hitting each other with rockets, but...
[21:53.21]Looks like the red soldier that would be... Melee has to back out, doesn't want to die.
[21:58.38]We still have frags being traded off, actually.
[22:00.50]Frags being bullied, the red side getting destroyed.
[22:02.90]And uh-oh, there goes the medic as well.
[22:04.44]We have the bowling ball being launched by the blue Demo Dewodna.
[22:08.19]And yeah, the only person to get a kill was that strange Pyro Pig.
[22:12.33]So Jerma maybe knew a little bit there, Sal.
[22:15.24]But his team got crushed there early in that first mid.
[22:18.71]Yeah, it was not terribly surprising.
[22:21.25]What I was watching on the way out was Pure's rollout, and he totally flubbed it, so he had to get to mid-fight with, like, half health.
[22:26.72]He got bombed by Blaze right away.
[22:28.30]Blaze saw that weakness and just kind of pounced on it, as he is known to do.
[22:32.49]So right now, it is going to be a nice easy cap on Spire by TeamStir underscore.
[22:37.79]The underscore is silent.
[22:39.62]I get that wrong every time.
[22:41.44]So they're going to finish that cap.
[22:43.30]They're going to start pushing in towards last.
[22:45.00]Here's the question.
[22:45.89]How do they get into O?
[22:46.85]Oh, never mind.
[22:47.87]That's answered.
[22:49.45]Yeah, they're going to make the medic drop, and that's not good, obviously.
[22:52.23]Shade, one of the best medics, if not the best medic in the history of North American TF2.
[22:56.64]His team is trying to rally with him being down.
[22:58.50]They've dropped three.
[22:59.73]Mayla finds a home with a direct hit rocket, and they're actually capping Spire right now.
[23:03.39]It is Mayla.
[23:05.55]He is gonna make the medic pop just the fierce out getting hit by one of those 125 damage beasts Forced in dust to pop his uber.
[23:14.25]So nice scrappy play by red.
[23:16.41]They're gonna be able to stay in this for now But with stabby stabby running around and in this situation with a pyro hunting form at all times I feel for the guy I hope he can make something happen here
[23:27.05]I've seen him at least in the last, I'm not sure if he's having ping issues or what, but I saw him just kind of standing still as Huey Lewis and somebody else were shooting at him.
[23:35.85]He's like, yeah, okay, I'll take it.
[23:38.01]That's all he's doing sometimes at the moment.
[23:40.40]Like he can run the Dead Ringer and kind of always be alive and always be a threat, causing people to look behind them, but that's just not enough.
[23:47.91]That, on the other hand, stab and blaze, that's enough.
[23:50.38]That's a great play by him.
[23:51.46]It does get killed off by Duana.
[23:53.34]But that's really what he has to do for the red team to stay in it.
[23:57.48]Jerma's team.
[23:58.38]It's kind of a high risk, high reward.
[24:00.24]You can make a big play, get the high value backstab.
[24:03.87]He's going to be killed pretty much instantly after showing himself or getting that first kill if he's even able to do so.
[24:10.44]Both teams are going to have Uba here defending and Stabby Stabby permanently running that pick class.
[24:15.19]He's going to run out and try to make something happen yet again.
[24:17.19]We'll see if he can find Zemedik.
[24:19.63]What is going to happen here is we're spamming out here.
[24:22.08]This is turning into a real 6v6 match with spam and taking their time and trying to find a pick.
[24:28.12]We are going to go in.
[24:28.92]At least Tag is going to walk in.
[24:30.89]Gets the uber force.
[24:32.43]And Indus is going to pop much later, so Blue has a nice uber.
[24:35.63]But look at the pyro shenanigans just airblasting into each other.
[24:38.64]Tag gets a double kill onto his nemesis, Mela, as well.
[24:42.12]He did one in, got the pop, and he's going to help his team win.
[24:45.13]So just not enough fragging power at the end there, Sal.
[24:47.65]Need the extra damage that maybe an ambassador spy just can't provide.
[24:53.05]Well, right now, I mean, the spy's been just totally shut down, which is kind of sad to see because, of course, we love seeing every class do well, but 6v6 is kind of a game mode that has been honed over the years to hate spies and other classes.
[25:07.64]I've always said that there is room in the meta for things to change.
[25:11.03]I'm not sure for Pyrospy in a traditional lineup, but certainly people believe that we found the best possible way to play 6v6, but there's always a wrinkle, something that could work in a spot, and we'll see if that comes through here.
[25:24.24]Blueside is doing, again, winning this mid fight.
[25:26.75]Pure goes down.
[25:27.51]He was stuck out in Valley by himself,
[25:29.33]Shade's actually in the closet area by himself, which is not a great spot to be.
[25:33.61]He's going to try to borrow some of those surfing techniques that we saw yesterday.
[25:36.92]But no, he's going to go down, in fact, to the Ubersaw of Indust, who now does, in fact, have Uber.
[25:43.16]And Ster picked the anti-fun team as they are just running through this first game.
[25:49.09]Well, one thing to notice is that the only person who died in both those midfights was Shrugger.
[25:54.61]Poor guy.
[25:55.59]He also did kill Ruin in a one-on-one scout fight right off the bat, which is really what Shrugger needs to do.
[26:01.28]Ruin considered the best, if not one of the best.
[26:03.85]Oh, Mela!
[26:05.21]Oh, man.
[26:05.71]I was just watching Mela's cam, and he just sat there for a second.
[26:08.74]It might have been taunting.
[26:10.18]Totally destroyed Shrugger, who tried to dodge that direct hit.
[26:13.31]Could not do it.
[26:14.65]Oh man, I'm sorry I missed it.
[26:15.66]I love the direct hit.
[26:16.50]It is so awesome.
[26:17.34]I wish it was the only rocket launcher.
[26:19.00]Melee is going to end up dying to Huey Lewis, who airblasted and shot him down.
[26:23.05]Here comes the uber into last in Dustin Company, trying to go up 2-0 here.
[26:26.87]Tag goes down pure with the debt onto him, trying to do something for his team, but he is just getting destroyed by people.
[26:33.06]Stabby, stabby!
[26:33.66]He's throwing his knife around on the point, and there it is.
[26:36.14]Second round.
[26:36.76]Stabby tried to get a stab.
[26:39.19]Wait, he was standing on that point the whole time, wasn't he?
[26:41.51]Or did he get popped up?
[26:43.26]What happened?
[26:44.20]I think he just died, didn't he?
[26:46.02]No, he was still there.
[26:46.76]Maybe he was a Dead Ringer.
[26:48.39]Oh yeah, he is totally running the Dead Ringer.
[26:49.97]Good call.
[26:51.77]Alright, so we're at fight number three.
[26:54.08]Sal's getting a little nervous here.
[26:55.34]I hope Jermis' team can figure it out and make this a little more competitive.
[26:58.80]You know, I hope for his sake Jerma can pick a better team next time.
[27:03.07]The Stabby Stabby first pick, I loved it, but the Pyro... Insider info, I believe in Stabby Stabby, but he said he wasn't at where he usually plays competitively.
[27:14.57]He's on a boat.
[27:15.89]Well, I remember back in the 4v4 match that I ran a little while ago, Stabby did a fantastic job.
[27:22.06]Right now it looks like Ruin's getting some good kills, so at least this mid fight's not going as poorly for Team Jerma as the previous ones.
[27:28.71]In fact, I think that's going to be a win for Team Red.
[27:32.22]Yeah, Dewan is still in mid, but he's by himself.
[27:34.46]Demo obviously capable of doing everything and more, but Dewan is a solid player.
[27:39.95]He's not going to try the fancy thing.
[27:41.49]I would in front of all these viewers, but he's not.
[27:44.34]And yeah, that was a great mid win.
[27:46.54]He's gonna try to burn the combo in.
[27:51.15]Yeah, they're gonna trade air blasts, a little kiss there.
[27:54.51]And on the other side, Dewana did kill Brad, but he ended up going down to that Satan flank.
[27:59.64]And Red does have mid for the first time.
[28:02.38]Satan's really enjoying the, what do you call it, the flare gun as well, getting those flare shots off, and hoping he can just keep people ignited, cause a lot of damage on that team that can't really be healed effectively by the med, because it just keeps burning down for so long.
[28:16.55]But right now, it looks like Blue has made a repush, and a very successful one at that.
[28:20.01]They're just, they're so much faster than the red team, you know, what are you going to do when you don't have enough people on your team to rocket jump, you know, sticky jump around?
[28:27.28]Yeah, and I like that Huey Lewis, the blue pyro, is using the shotty.
[28:30.54]Flare gun's nice, but the burst damage, and if you can aim, the shotgun is just such a good weapon.
[28:35.45]I mean, it really is.
[28:36.27]It's a soldier secondary, you know?
[28:37.67]It's the scout Scattergun.
[28:38.73]It's really, really good.
[28:40.41]Oh, he had a huge air shot there on Mela.
[28:43.26]You know he's doing it.
[28:44.02]Will he drop a bind?
[28:45.30]He might just get up and flex in front of nobody in his apartment.
[28:48.16]That was huge.
[28:48.92]Pure is going to go down as well to tag.
[28:50.28]He's been direct hitting in pubs all weekend long, so he is warmed up.
[28:54.73]And it looks like Blue is just going to cap Spire easily, Sal, and roll into last.
[28:59.02]I think at this point, yeah, they're going to cap last easily.
[29:01.46]That was not difficult for them at all.
[29:03.82]There's four up, but they just didn't want to go to defend.
[29:06.19]And we are up three to nothing.
[29:07.85]And Tag is just going to drop a simple little Clockwork meat shot Smiley to let his buddy Maela know that he got him.
[29:15.42]Is that a Clockwork or a Carnage?
[29:17.56]Carnage is the eight.
[29:19.61]Oh, you're right.
[29:20.33]So Clockwork has modified it.
[29:22.61]Yeah.
[29:23.91]You know, I tend not to be lucky at all in any aspect of my life, but we do have decent damage being laid down by a Pyro.
[29:34.92]And at the moment, it looks as if the fight might just go Team Jerma's way.
[29:39.18]They're taking down Blazey and Shrugger right now.
[29:40.56]Pure laying down some pretty good damage.
[29:41.97]Tags off the field.
[29:42.85]So it's just a Pyro-Med-Demo combo.
[29:45.61]And make that a Demo-Med combo.
[29:47.83]Pyro is down for the count.
[29:49.57]Where are Duatna and Indus?
[29:52.80]They got back.
[29:53.67]Get ready to defend that spire.
[29:55.60]Yeah, and Stabby Stabby's running around.
[29:57.42]He is in position to try to do something here.
[30:00.28]We'll see if he's able to get a stab off.
[30:02.47]But look at that.
[30:02.97]They're always looking for him.
[30:04.17]They always are able to find him.
[30:05.43]Shrugger's going to drop him off in a place that we call trash in competitive TF2 because there's trash over there.
[30:11.88]Uber's going to be popped off by Indust.
[30:13.40]It looks like he got forced in a spot he didn't want to.
[30:16.19]Look at the flare gun crit kill onto Taggeron.
[30:19.11]He will not be happy after that.
[30:20.83]And look at that.
[30:21.25]The arrow kill from Indust.
[30:22.86]The Crusader's crossbow drops purely...
[30:24.98]a nice play by him.
[30:27.18]Cap is going down though, and Mela is in position for what I like to call the direct hit fun spot.
[30:32.11]Look at him and Tag.
[30:32.95]Tag refuses to jump his Soldier counterpart.
[30:35.89]He's just electing to spam, and Mela got pushed off of his perch, and it looks like Red is gonna get cleaned up here.
[30:41.72]Stabby Stabby is running around.
[30:43.98]We'll see if he's able to get a back cap or get something to happen up there.
[30:47.05]He's looking like he wants to try to get the demos out.
[30:50.27]And he's dead.
[30:50.98]Yeah, no, he got caught out there.
[30:52.88]And it did look like maybe that was an audible thing where you can hear that uncloak if you're close enough to it.
[30:59.00]So I think that's just what happened there is he got unlucky on the sound range.
[31:04.11]Yeah, it's tough.
[31:06.49]Yeah, I don't know.
[31:07.69]I'm rooting for Stabby Stabby.
[31:08.70]I think he'll make a play before this is all said and done.
[31:11.16]It's not like Stabby to get crushed.
[31:12.70]We're going to see a flanking Soldier here in a second, I think, for red.
[31:15.99]No, Maela was in position to jump from mid, but he's just going to watch the team go to Spire.
[31:20.98]Watch the blue team go to Spire and team-Ster
[31:23.67]Tag is set up now.
[31:24.93]Look at two direct hits on top of Spire.
[31:27.20]What are you gonna do, Mela?
[31:28.52]He's man enough to jump up there, and he actually avoids the air shots.
[31:31.88]He's going right into both soldiers.
[31:33.75]Pure is trying to fight off at last, and they've done a great job.
[31:36.13]Look at Mela!
[31:37.19]They've got the melees at home!
[31:39.09]He's got them.
[31:40.26]The skill stick.
[31:41.56]Sal, they chipped away at each other like they're mining for diamonds.
[31:45.65]And Blaze found himself a nice one for the equalizer kill.
[31:49.48]I love it.
[31:50.02]Oh, my gosh.
[31:50.90]I've been watching the Huey cam, actually, and if you've paid any attention to the kill feed at all, it's been Huey, Huey, Huey all day long, man.
[31:56.35]Yeah, he's been great.
[31:56.83]It's been kind of ridiculous.
[31:58.08]I want to give a quick plug.
[31:59.50]We have 20 minutes left if you guys want to enter the raffles.
[32:01.72]We're going to close those early so we can get the winners, and then we'll name off the winners during the last hour of the stream.
[32:07.11]The star auction, if you want to get a bid in, it's going pretty crazy.
[32:10.19]It's up to $3,800 for the star golden sniper rifle.
[32:14.06]What?
[32:14.64]What?
[32:14.76]There's a lot of options.
[32:15.36]We'll spend a lot of time in chat.
[32:17.89]Come on, Star!
[32:18.85]Make it 4,000, buddy!
[32:20.41]Double down on it!
[32:21.71]That's crazy.
[32:23.18]That's intense.
[32:24.42]Well, man, I hope that whoever wins gets to pay.
[32:27.66]In the meantime, we do have... Oh, and if you decide to troll the bids, we're just gonna go down until we find the legit bid that is donated, so please do not do any troll bids.
[32:36.15]Should be some repercussions for that, that's ridiculous.
[32:37.76]So 20 minutes left, Sean, on every raffle that's left, so all the ones at the end are gonna end in 20 minutes, is what you're saying?
[32:44.62]Yes, all the raffles will be done.
[32:46.38]You can still donate, but no more raffle entries after 20 minutes because we're going to finalize them and pull winners.
[32:51.09]I think Star's rifle just passed 4,000.
[32:54.82]Well...
[32:57.06]Get those donations in right now if you want to be eligible for the raffles.
[33:00.04]There's so many awesome things that you can win.
[33:01.80]Twitch shirts, mechanical keyboards, and just hundreds of unusual hats and other cool in-game stuff.
[33:08.01]The 201 fail items that TruckTruck and Lang uncrated that had me literally laughing on the floor.
[33:13.86]That entire backpack with actual valuable things added to it to make it worth something.
[33:19.74]It's also up in 20 minutes left.
[33:21.51]You have to donate the next 20 minutes, so get to it.
[33:24.99]The uncrated one's over.
[33:26.57]Oh, that already went?
[33:27.33]So you can't win that.
[33:28.41]Yeah, that one was over at the end of the uncrating event.
[33:30.50]Oh, sorry, I thought that was one of the ones at the end.
[33:32.20]My bad.
[33:32.56]So you can't win that, but you don't really want it anyway.
[33:35.81]Well, Shrugger just went huge while we were talking about that, but pretty standard stuff right now.
[33:40.35]Looks like they are ready to cap last already, and that might just end the game if we're playing 5-0 Mercy rule.
[33:45.54]We are playing 5-0 Mercy rule, and we're just playing 5-0 game over rule.
[33:50.33]There it is.
[33:51.33]Pyro's going to cap it in style.
[33:52.73]Huey Lewis is my MVP.
[33:54.61]Dom's 28 points.
[33:55.66]Doing it for the Highlanders.
[33:57.44]Just crushes that red team under their boot.
[34:00.76]And, Ster, you are no friend of fun today, sir.
[34:05.87]Hey, ain't no friend to me.
[34:08.07]That was something.
[34:09.45]Alright, so we're going to actually play another one after that.
[34:11.49]So we're going to get back into, I believe, the pick and ban stages, if that is not correct.
[34:16.19]I believe it is, in fact, correct.
[34:17.86]Do we have Jerma in here still?
[34:21.18]Yeah.
[34:22.06]Jerma, I need you to pick a better team.
[34:27.75]Okay, GG.
[34:28.27]You should have not banned Oplab.
[34:31.27]I feel like he would have really changed the dynamic of that match with getting up onto Spire as well.
[34:38.14]Okay, so are we going to reset the graphics, Lang?
[34:41.16]Yeah, they're up right now.
[34:41.90]They've been reset.
[34:43.00]Okay, sweet.
[34:43.33]So we are ready to go.
[34:44.15]Why don't we switch up... Who banned first last time?
[34:47.11]I banned first.
[34:48.41]Okay, so Jerma... And now, what is different in this run-through?
[34:51.52]Are the people that just played ineligible to play in this one, so automatically banned?
[34:56.16]Or is that not the case?
[34:57.77]The people that just played are going to be auto-banned.
[34:59.59]So we're trying to use most of the hero pool.
[35:02.37]Lang, if you want to go down and look at the mumble channels and auto-ban those people.
[35:05.80]Okay.
[35:06.08]The list that Whisker pasted me in the chat is correct, right?
[35:10.71]Mela, Ruin, Satan, Shade, Stabby Stabby, Autobanned.
[35:16.15]I'm going to ban these guys.
[35:19.40]Blaze, Dewatna, Huey, Dust, Shrugger, Tag.
[35:23.48]Banning them out.
[35:24.38]I'm going to ban those guys.
[35:25.52]I'm just going to ban them out.
[35:26.52]Oh, and you have Pure as well.
[35:28.01]You have the Whisker...
[35:30.40]ListWhisker linked you.
[35:32.08]Okay, so you guys remember who you picked last time.
[35:34.26]Those people that actually played are ineligible.
[35:36.75]The ones you banned are eligible.
[35:38.21]So, Jerma, you get to first ban, sir.
[35:42.23]So the people that were banned last game are eligible?
[35:45.10]Yep, only the ones that actually played are ineligible.
[35:47.94]Okay.
[35:50.54]So, first ban, right?
[35:52.86]Yep.
[35:54.03]I'm drunk.
[35:55.21]You don't have an excuse.
[35:58.57]Hmm.
[36:03.05]You are the sorriest excuses for something I've ever seen.
[36:06.90]This is intense.
[36:08.78]I mean, redeem yourself?
[36:11.56]Well, no.
[36:12.20]That last team, I was trying to do something different.
[36:16.47]It didn't really work out 100%.
[36:17.43]Oh, we're playing Koth Viaduct, by the way.
[36:20.15]So maybe take that into consideration.
[36:23.46]I want to ban some snipers or heavies.
[36:25.98]I don't know.
[36:29.80]Okay, I'm going to ban.
[36:31.74]You may want to wait until Lang gets the pick screen updated on the stream.
[36:34.46]We're good.
[36:35.38]Oh, we're good.
[36:35.98]Yep.
[36:42.09]Oh, all plaids on here is a heavy?
[36:46.03]That's awesome.
[36:47.27]I love you guys.
[36:52.34]I want to ban a sniper, but I feel like... You're going to want one?
[36:58.01]Yeah, I want one, so... But there were no snipers in that last one, so... Now, in Dota, there is a stopwatch here for you.
[37:07.59]I'm not going to... Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[37:12.24]But if you like, you can make it... You got this, you know?
[37:16.29]So, are we coming up on the last hour to donate for the raffles?
[37:19.33]Is that right?
[37:20.44]Oh, you just said the last 15 minutes, so... Yeah, 15 minutes, so hurry, hurry, hurry.
[37:26.05]In Jerma, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[37:27.39]I'm banning Paragon.
[37:29.09]Paragon's gone!
[37:30.15]Alright, Star, who are you banning?
[37:33.26]Like, I'd pick Paragon over my boy Pau, a shout-out to Basil.
[37:39.01]I'm gonna ban...
[37:45.08]I was thinking of banning Oplad, but I'm not going to be that mean.
[37:54.84]Ah, this is tough.
[37:56.30]I'm going to ban... Uh, Feral.
[38:01.45]Sorry, Feral.
[38:03.17]Okay, next ban.
[38:04.47]Very sorry.
[38:05.27]Hopefully this one takes a little less time.
[38:08.51]Hey, hey.
[38:09.74]This is complicated.
[38:10.72]Like, look at this list of people moving around and dancing.
[38:13.94]You have to evaluate the dances before you figure this out.
[38:16.66]I've been looking at Amarmaduke's character doing his little shimmy with the beard and the cop glasses and mustache.
[38:23.29]It's pretty awesome.
[38:24.11]Jerm, are you ready, buddy?
[38:25.23]I'm banning Pau.
[38:26.32]Pau, get gone!
[38:28.12]Back to Brazil!
[38:29.12]Oh, you're just gonna crush all the snipers and get maxed?
[38:31.70]I saw that on the chat.
[38:33.33]They want to see Max versus Powell.
[38:34.73]And I actually would really like to see that as well.
[38:36.57]That would have been nice.
[38:37.71]But, you know, I could first pick.
[38:39.19]So if that's your angle.
[38:40.83]That's true.
[38:41.71]But you have one more ban.
[38:46.10]Huh.
[38:48.06]Max.
[38:48.44]I'm banning Max.
[38:49.78]Interesting.
[38:50.52]This is a no snipers.
[38:53.71]No fun zone.
[38:54.25]Okay.
[38:55.19]Cool.
[38:55.31]So now you get the first pick.
[38:56.91]Mr. Dirk.
[38:58.97]First pick.
[39:00.65]This is a big one for Viaduct.
[39:02.42]There's a lot of ways I think you could take this, too.
[39:04.08]Heavies are pretty important on here.
[39:05.34]Everything can, you know, do something here.
[39:12.30]I'm just staring at Clockwork.
[39:14.99]Oh, yeah!
[39:16.97]I was thinking, because I banned him last time.
[39:19.05]I forgot all about unpicking Clockwork, by the way.
[39:22.19]Clockwork is the first pick.
[39:23.61]Jerma?
[39:27.60]I'm going to go with...
[39:31.53]I'm going to go with Seagull.
[39:32.95]Nice.
[39:33.57]Very good pick.
[39:34.09]Look at, by the way, Tyrone's icon thing down there is probably the best.
[39:38.65]I take it.
[39:38.97]I don't know, man.
[39:39.60]If I had to go with one, I'd go with Deadbolt just for the fact that he's able to reverse hyperdrive.
[39:44.16]I actually picture You Must Mike looking just like the way with that same pose as he's doing.
[39:49.13]Arms crossed, like, what's up, nerd?
[39:50.73]Okay, sweet.
[39:51.23]So, Ster, second pick.
[39:55.01]Um...
[40:02.07]I'm going to go with Xalox.
[40:02.93]I need a good demo on Viaduct.
[40:04.66]Did Xalox get... Was he banned last map?
[40:07.00]He was banned.
[40:07.86]He was banned.
[40:08.34]He did not play.
[40:09.79]Cool.
[40:10.13]Alright, Jerma, your second pick.
[40:14.44]I'm going to go Oplayed.
[40:20.35]Oh, play.
[40:23.05]The gamering legend is in the game.
[40:25.71]First TF2 in years.
[40:27.25]But you know what?
[40:28.08]It's like riding a bike for that guy.
[40:29.24]He's the best.
[40:29.92]He's the king.
[40:30.38]He's a winner.
[40:30.86]All he does is win games.
[40:32.24]Alright, we're going to ban now one each, and we are going to start with... Sir?
[40:38.51]Sir, right?
[40:38.97]Yeah, sir.
[40:39.59]Yeah, already back with the bans.
[40:41.88]I think I could do pretty dirty here in ban alpha, but I don't think I'm going to need to.
[40:49.54]Well, I don't think I want to do that.
[40:50.86]That seems like... That seems deep.
[40:53.80]Would you like to counter the heavy?
[40:55.39]Maybe a spy?
[40:56.83]Not to help out.
[40:59.37]Bring Stabby back.
[41:00.43]Well, I'm banning right now is the situation here.
[41:02.89]That is true.
[41:03.68]I'm an idiot.
[41:04.68]Yeah, get crushed, nerd.
[41:06.34]Roasted.
[41:09.76]I'm going to take out...
[41:12.15]Just gonna throw an arrow at Squid.
[41:17.40]Squid is gone.
[41:17.98]Mix up Squid.
[41:18.88]You are dead.
[41:21.08]Alright, Jerma, ban.
[41:22.78]I will take Alpha.
[41:24.61]You are banning Alpha?
[41:26.07]Oh, no, it's a ban.
[41:26.71]Okay, it's a ban.
[41:27.75]No, ban your only demo.
[41:29.23]Yeah, let me ban the only demo left.
[41:31.63]No, uh... Are these the last bans, by the way?
[41:37.04]No, you get two more picks after this one, and then one more ban.
[41:43.64]I'm going to ban... I'm going to ban Arthur.
[41:51.15]Oh, are you dead serious?
[41:52.51]I was going to pick him.
[41:53.43]Showdown of the heavies.
[41:54.75]Arthur, a little known fact, is the best heavy in the game.
[41:58.40]You've never seen Sam Lingle play heavy, sir.
[42:01.64]Okay, so we are now back to picks.
[42:04.88]In Germany, you actually get the first pick.
[42:07.12]I will take Alpha.
[42:08.21]That's a good pick.
[42:08.95]Thank you, sir.
[42:09.59]Alright, Stirr.
[42:12.51]I'm gonna drop.
[42:15.18]I was mean last time.
[42:19.94]I gotta put brown sugar in.
[42:22.43]That's Sizer.
[42:24.79]For anyone wondering, that would be Sizer.
[42:26.69]You don't even have to say sugar.
[42:27.73]Okay, so, Jerma, you're next.
[42:30.72]Second pick of this stage here.
[42:33.80]I will be taking Deadbolt.
[42:37.08]Alright, Deadbolt, you are up, sir.
[42:40.31]Uh, did you pick two?
[42:42.21]My pick?
[42:43.25]You only picked Sizer, right?
[42:44.85]Yeah, I picked Sizer.
[42:46.54]He picked a fellow.
[42:48.32]And then it came back to me.
[42:49.64]And then I picked Tyrone.
[42:52.20]Yes!
[42:52.77]Sizer and Tyrone together!
[42:54.49]Chat, I want clappings for Tyrone.
[42:56.87]I like with these reunions you guys got cooking up.
[42:59.72]We got Sizer, Tyrone, and Clockwork.
[43:02.34]Dude, Oplayed and Seagull?
[43:04.20]Like, what season was that?
[43:05.20]It was like season 5 and then season 10?
[43:07.79]Blightgating!
[43:10.12]I love it.
[43:10.79]Awesome.
[43:14.07]Yeah, we're gonna get another shout-out.
[43:15.51]Go ahead, Sean.
[43:16.87]AngrySockPuppet, who has a pretty awesome YouTube channel, a lot of nice SFM animations, he made all the portraits for this.
[43:24.48]I think he also made the idle screens for our transitions, is that right?
[43:29.01]Never mind.
[43:29.53]Okay, cancel that.
[43:30.17]Who made the impossible-to-conceive fact that this actually works?
[43:35.17]Would that be Lang?
[43:36.37]Yeah, this is amazing.
[43:38.03]It is really awesome.
[43:38.73]This is Lang's baby.
[43:39.93]Hi, this is all I did for two months.
[43:41.41]I didn't see people.
[43:44.90]This is like 5,000 lines of code or something.
[43:48.08]Can we get... Jeez, that's ridiculous.
[43:51.46]I don't want to abuse my power over Chad, but look at the clapas.
[43:55.33]I love it.
[43:55.89]Clapas for Tyrone.
[43:56.89]Let's get hearts for Lang for dedicating his life to this moment.
[44:00.41]Lang, you are the best.
[44:02.05]but I don't know if you know that we're in a band now so uh... story at one more person I believe or band what it would it would it was jama got he's got soldiers got done most Scott scout did I miss the first part of the source for a pic Karen yes I don't know you were too busy being flattered I'm sorry it's going to be a that's why I'm not a man are you sure good day
[44:31.85]There's so many people's dreams I don't want to crush.
[44:35.59]Yes, you do.
[44:37.92]My pants sell.
[44:38.94]Get out of here.
[44:50.43]I'm just going to throw one out there and get Grape out.
[44:53.13]Grape's in bed again.
[44:55.16]He was too good.
[44:55.82]He was too good earlier.
[44:56.68]I agree.
[44:56.96]I was going to pick you off.
[44:58.56]Was he banned first game?
[44:59.72]No?
[45:00.09]Okay.
[45:00.39]He was.
[45:01.77]Wasn't he?
[45:02.41]I think Grape was banned.
[45:03.47]Yeah, he was.
[45:03.97]I did.
[45:04.55]I was going to pick him this game, but... He's sitting there waiting to play on the bench.
[45:08.33]Put me in, coach!
[45:09.29]We just keep slapping him down.
[45:10.30]I'm so sorry.
[45:11.82]Alright, Jerma, you get one more ban.
[45:23.09]I'm going to ban the... I'm going to ban...
[45:28.60]Who gets first pick after this?
[45:31.07]You do.
[45:32.41]Alright, I'm gonna ban Smaca.
[45:36.38]I like where this is going.
[45:41.51]Okay, so then you get the next pick.
[45:43.51]So I will be picking the Fragile.
[45:50.96]I see the strategy, I see.
[45:53.48]Alright, now I don't want to interject, this is not my team, I'm not picking a team, but chat is onto something here.
[45:57.93]There is one man left to be picked that I think might just have to be picked.
[46:03.14]People throwing Mackies out there?
[46:04.92]I think they might need to see it.
[46:06.36]It's impossible, I need an off-class.
[46:09.80]Guys, I believe, but I'm following the rules here.
[46:12.45]Oh, that's true.
[46:13.75]Sorry, chat.
[46:14.37]Well, Mackie plays everything.
[46:15.53]Okay, you're right.
[46:16.07]directly sees on their soldier he's not on there as wild card I think that there's a wild card but I'm gonna need to get one is off classes I got a spy I mean you've got a heavy make sense engineers make sense may be on fire that they could throw up some stuff all we got pyros could reflect heavy awesome I I would leave in the spy play and get high I will wait a little bit that's over to get out of a review of it
[46:46.38]Jerma, last pick for you, buddy.
[46:50.18]Last pick.
[46:53.07]Pick Mackie.
[46:54.79]Yeah, I think the chat will kill you if you don't pick Mackie.
[46:58.43]Last pick is going to be Mackie, baby.
[47:01.10]Mackie versus Tyrone.
[47:02.60]Why not?
[47:02.90]Hey!
[47:03.18]Alright, last pick for this second game.
[47:07.24]Do I want a Medic?
[47:08.86]What choices do I have?
[47:11.08]Hmm, Ninja Nick, I'm gonna pick you up on Medic.
[47:12.84]I think you're gonna do a great job.
[47:14.04]You know, just sock it to him.
[47:16.69]Good luck, Ninja Nick.
[47:18.55]Alright, we have, uh, we have, I think, a much better 6v6.
[47:21.91]Same server?
[47:23.38]SeanDabood?
[47:26.00]Yes, I believe that's correct.
[47:27.38]Tyrone is messaging me right now on Steam.
[47:29.20]He's not happy about the turn of events.
[47:31.95]Ha ha ha!
[47:33.19]But I am, I would love to see this.
[47:35.65]By the way, guys and gals, we are running out of time to get in on our donations.
[47:38.82]I believe our donations for the raffle, donations will be up for the rest of the night.
[47:44.41]But if you wanna be eligible for the raffle, I wanna say you have like three minutes left.
[47:48.36]If that's not, I think that's right.
[47:52.22]Oh, truck, truck.
[47:54.79]Yeah, we have just all sorts of goodies.
[47:57.17]I don't even know.
[47:57.57]It will take me three minutes to say all of them.
[48:00.46]But we have Twitch t-shirts.
[48:02.56]We have mechanical keyboards.
[48:04.30]We have all sorts of unusual hats signed by various e-celebrities a million times more famous than I am in the internet.
[48:12.60]We have things signed by...
[48:13.62]We have things signed by DJ Wheat.
[48:15.77]Mini Wheat.
[48:16.79]You want this stuff that is being raffled off.
[48:19.15]And the only way you can do it is if you get your donations in now.
[48:22.24]Just like Ralph Numbers just did.
[48:24.08]He donated $75.
[48:25.98]Thank you so much, Ralph Numbers.
[48:27.39]I hope that you win something awesome.
[48:29.15]So please, guys and gals, get the donations in.
[48:32.08]Let's crack 90K soon.
[48:36.59]Are we going into the same server, by the way?
[48:39.45]That's what I heard.
[48:40.83]Did you plug the auctions?
[48:43.10]We've got about three minutes left on those as well.
[48:44.46]I think the star rifle is over 5k now.
[48:47.14]Oh my god.
[48:49.23]Why are you doing this to yourselves?
[48:53.89]Oh wow, that's amazing though, guys.
[48:55.58]Whoever gets it... Are the auctions closing in two minutes?
[48:59.46]It's going to be gold.
[49:01.06]Can we go over there and cook this person dinner or something, too?
[49:04.60]The auctions are ending in about three minutes.
[49:07.59]Get your last bets in there.
[49:09.77]Whatever item you want, make sure you don't get outbid in the last second.
[49:12.58]It's eBay up in here.
[49:14.10]Before they added the eBay thing, that made it easier to not get outbid.
[49:18.36]The maximum bid.
[49:19.59]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[49:23.60]Yeah, definitely get those bids in right now, and then we will be reading off the winners after things are calculated.
[49:29.23]We're going to do yet another hour of pubbing, and the powers that be are going to mash their brains together and figure things out, and then we'll get the winners out not too long after.
[49:39.58]So, yeah.
[49:40.48]Well, good luck to everybody.
[49:41.34]I hope you get your donations in soon, and then everyone wins something somehow.
[49:45.77]All 7,000 of you.
[49:48.29]We are almost at 5,000 donations, Sal.
[49:51.37]Isn't that ridiculous?
[49:53.42]That is not ridiculous.
[49:55.95]It's not ridiculous.
[49:57.54]No, I think that everybody who's watched this, frankly, should be donating just a little bit for kids.
[50:04.02]That is true.
[50:05.14]I believe it is $2 minimum to be eligible for a raffle.
[50:09.96]So if you have $2 laying around in a PayPal, every little bit helps.
[50:13.51]Absolutely helps.
[50:15.99]Thank you so much to everybody who has donated any amount of money.
[50:18.83]Except for you trolls who have been donating one penny to say something funny on stream.
[50:22.58]Like, it's really good.
[50:23.30]We're trolling the kids.
[50:27.16]Otherwise, we're good.
[50:27.88]We're still on Badlands.
[50:29.75]We need to switch the map here.
[50:31.15]I'm guessing someone will do that pretty soon.
[50:34.07]Until then, I guess we can just get to fill time.
[50:36.19]We are no strangers to that, you and I, Seabear.
[50:38.36]No, not at all, my friend.
[50:40.50]Born to fill time.
[50:42.26]Ster, Jerma, what do you guys think about your teams?
[50:44.56]You happy with who you got?
[50:47.42]I'm creating a poll right now in honor of Sizer, who I've picked for the chat, to vote for Ster's team, Jerma's team, or, of course, StarSmells.
[50:56.03]I think... Why would you put that as an option?
[50:58.81]In honor of Sizer.
[51:00.14]In honor of Sizer.
[51:01.28]I just feel like it needs to be there.
[51:03.20]I have huge faith in my team.
[51:05.80]I want to see high go huge.
[51:07.75]A lot of these show matches and stuff, Stabby Stabby gets to play awesome, but I've never seen any of the other spies really get a chance in an environment like this, and I just want to see it go awesome.
[51:16.71]And Oplat, I'm sorry for banning you.
[51:18.71]Prove that it was a good choice that I banned you last time because you're too powerful to be stopped.
[51:24.29]Oplat is on your team?
[51:25.80]No, he's on Jerma's team.
[51:27.12]You don't want him to do well?
[51:28.08]I banned him last time.
[51:29.64]He's on Jerma's team now.
[51:31.77]I want to show the reasoning behind it.
[51:34.01]He's just going to crush.
[51:34.93]You don't understand.
[51:36.34]He's going to absolutely crush.
[51:38.44]Look at Clockwork, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:41.99]He's in the server, tagged up as EMG Clockwork.
[51:45.45]For all of you that remember...
[51:46.74]Oh man, when was EMG?
[51:47.88]I want to say like season 6, 7, 8.
[51:50.54]That was Tyrone, Mackie, Banny, Clockwork.
[51:53.60]One of the original great teams in our game, in North American TF2.
[51:58.61]And it's going to bring back some nostalgic feelings to see them on the same team, at least in the same server.
[52:04.64]I can't believe I probably casted 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of their matches per season for a while, it seems like.
[52:12.72]Yeah, I can recall back when they were the dominant force in TF2.
[52:17.39]Whatever happened to that team, by the way?
[52:18.95]Because it sounded like they just kind of stopped enjoying playing with each other.
[52:22.44]Yeah, well, it's the TF2 North American team thing.
[52:26.75]I got to think of the EU guys and gals have the same problem.
[52:30.56]We scrim this game so much, and you just in-mumble so much with each other.
[52:34.00]If you don't really like each other, like Mixup, those guys really like each other, and that's why they've been together for so long.
[52:39.67]Otherwise, we see teams sort of reform, maybe a couple of carryovers.
[52:44.18]EMG had a great run.
[52:45.14]Tyrone was a great leader, but I think real life caught up with him.
[52:48.44]He just didn't have enough time.
[52:49.68]Yeah, that's true.
[52:50.41]Banny and company wanted to play more.
[52:52.79]But yeah, it's great to see them all back.
[52:54.61]And I know Chad is excited to see Big Daddy Tyrone, the former king of TF2, one of our true legends in this game.
[53:02.12]Look at all the legends we have in this game.
[53:03.54]Oplad was on the first great team in TF2 history, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:08.55]We're talking 07.
[53:09.55]Old team pandemic.
[53:11.10]They won the CGS.
[53:13.46]Still to this day, biggest cash prize in the history of TF2 was like 08 when Oplad won it.
[53:18.39]So I'm pumped.
[53:21.24]I'm almost positive I know the answer to this, but is Mini-Wheat actually younger than competitive TF2?
[53:29.13]No.
[53:32.03]He's 8, so no.
[53:33.19]I like where you're going, I like where your head's at there, Sal, but no.
[53:38.52]I think since maybe the beta of this game was out, and maybe there was a scrim, but no.
[53:43.71]Mini-Week was, uh, he was learning how to crawl when we started playing competitive Df2.
[53:48.52]Let's throw it up there.
[53:49.96]We have just missing one in the server.
[53:52.20]Not sure whom that is, but I would like to get this started.
[53:57.15]Yeah, I sure would too, but, you know, we're being paid to fill time.
[53:59.69]I mean, not being paid to fill time.
[54:02.39]Are you not getting paid?
[54:03.94]Wait.
[54:05.18]Oh, no, I mean, like, yeah, it's fine.
[54:08.10]I'm just kidding, I'm not getting paid a cent.
[54:09.96]Doing it for the kids.
[54:10.84]Hashtag for the kids.
[54:12.04]That's right.
[54:12.70]What do you think about the teams?
[54:14.73]I'm looking at red team, Oplat, so that would be Jerma's team is the red team, same as before.
[54:20.33]We have the Fragile on Medic, Alpha on Demo, Deadbolt.
[54:25.78]Tyrone and, is it Tyrone and Maela on the same team?
[54:28.14]I know there's one team that has two soldiers, one team that only has one, but the two soldier team also I think is lacking a heavy, so.
[54:33.83]Yeah, I think Opla is going to enjoy himself some Tyrone during the course of this game, as we do have all 12 in.
[54:40.54]And you can just go ahead and call this to go live.
[54:44.43]We're ready.
[54:45.21]Alright, I'm going to let him know.
[54:46.51]Sweet.
[54:47.31]Alright, good luck.
[54:47.99]Have fun, Sal.
[54:48.79]I'm excited.
[54:49.31]I think the blue team is the favorite just because they have Sizer and Clockwork on Scout, and those are two of the best players at their position.
[54:57.36]Not sure if Sizer spent a little time out of the top levels of this game, but Clockwork certainly is considered the best Scout in the game.
[55:03.47]Sizer's heating up.
[55:06.39]Every time he gets a kill spree, I want that in.
[55:08.97]We're going to need to link the comms at some point.
[55:12.03]We have some magical personalities down there.
[55:13.95]Absolutely do.
[55:16.20]The clockwork Tyrone dynamic is just incredible.
[55:20.06]Let me get that set up so I can see when things are happening.
[55:25.61]I'm ready.
[55:25.93]Just go ahead and go live.
[55:26.67]We'll figure it out.
[55:27.60]Yep, they're readying up.
[55:30.46]Sweet.
[55:30.88]Alright.
[55:31.96]Sal, who do you think is going to win?
[55:33.18]You said the team with two soldiers or the team with the heavy?
[55:36.84]You know what?
[55:37.94]I'm throwing it to the team with the heavy.
[55:40.03]Yeah, me too.
[55:41.05]Sam Lingle.
[55:41.67]All Sam Lingle does is win video games.
[55:43.55]Sorry, sir.
[55:46.13]Kaiser's heating up.
[55:48.45]He's on fire.
[55:51.96]Okay, so we are going to go ready up.
[55:54.38]I think, yeah, no.
[55:57.12]There are some true video game legends on both teams.
[55:59.47]I don't know if I can pick against either Tyrone.
[56:02.17]All he does is win video games.
[56:03.85]Sam Oplad Lingle feels so good.
[56:06.75]I think things are closed now when we alt-tab here.
[56:08.99]It looks like, yeah.
[56:10.23]So all the raffles are canceled, or not canceled, but closed.
[56:13.65]So hopefully you guys win.
[56:16.05]And we can still donate.
[56:17.57]We hope you do.
[56:18.30]We want to still break $100,000 for Sal's big smile.
[56:23.42]Yeah, I don't smile until I see at least five zeros in any figure.
[56:28.42]Show them the money, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:31.29]It could be because I work in the oil industry.
[56:32.73]I don't know.
[56:33.69]Yeah, Sal's an oil tycoon.
[56:37.42]Yeah, like a 10-gallon hat.
[56:40.85]Yeah, I wish I were a tycoon, man.
[56:42.39]That would be awesome.
[56:44.67]Yeah, we've talked about... Sal's complained to me about his work a lot.
[56:47.76]He has some bad stories about the oil industry.
[56:52.10]It's not as fun and glamorous as one might think.
[56:55.59]No, I only got to club like two baby seals last year.
[56:58.39]It was really disappointing.
[57:00.31]You're a bad guy.
[57:01.12]There were PETA protesters everywhere.
[57:03.78]Looks like we're sticking with the direct hit.
[57:05.61]I hope Tyrone isn't using the direct hit, because that skill ceiling is a little too high for my boy.
[57:10.05]No, he's using the good old regular stick.
[57:13.74]He's going to be the first death, so things are back to normal.
[57:16.61]Alpha piping Tyrone here.
[57:17.97]Blue team already on the back foot.
[57:19.75]Ninja Nick is going to go down to the rocket bomb by Seagull, who was doing that all day long on the last LAN.
[57:27.10]And a regular stab, so both medics are down.
[57:30.01]Crazy mid fight here that is suddenly and dynamically gonna go in favor of the blue team.
[57:35.24]Tyrone died before putting out a point of damage, but his team wins mid.
[57:39.18]I'm feeling like I've seen this before, so.
[57:41.81]Welcome to the EMG days.
[57:43.29]Ty dies instantly, still in the point.
[57:48.11]Oh, yes, I remember this very, very well.
[57:51.20]But we'll see what happens, man.
[57:52.50]Anything can.
[57:53.34]It's just that when Red Team has to fight for every inch of positioning here, we will see where they can actually manage to push that far forward.
[57:59.81]The Heavy can zone a lot out, right?
[58:01.41]Like, he can do a lot in the way of keeping those scouts away from an area.
[58:05.22]But then, of course, he's got to watch out for Hay all the time.
[58:07.81]Yeah, well, I feel like we do have a Kritzkrieg in the hands of Ninja Nick, and he is going possibly to be critting Tyrone.
[58:15.31]This Kritz is at 70%, so I want to quickly throw to the comms of the blue team, looking down.
[58:19.82]Oh, they already have Team Alpha and Team Jir in Mumble.
[58:21.88]So yeah, let's listen to the blue team.
[58:24.80]Wait, you want to put it on me?
[58:26.04]No, that's a bad idea.
[58:27.00]Alright, let's go, dude.
[58:29.01]What?
[58:30.19]Okay.
[58:30.39]Are you sure?
[58:30.81]Let's do this shit.
[58:32.55]Go for it.
[58:35.16]Oh my god, this is terrible.
[58:38.52]Sorry, man.
[58:41.31]It's really good.
[58:42.73]Oh my god, that zombie.
[58:44.13]Right side.
[58:45.91]Gabi's weak.
[58:52.71]Yeah, that was... That was, uh... Well, Chad, if you had Tyrone, we'd bit the crits horribly and swear a few times and be otherwise hilarious.
[59:03.24]You win the prize.
[59:05.99]Oh, man.
[59:07.21]I love TF2.
[59:08.07]I really do.
[59:08.67]I love it, Sal.
[59:09.45]I love it to death.
[59:10.97]Yeah, I don't know what exactly we were expecting there on that crits creed, but, you know, it went as beautifully as we could have imagined.
[59:16.40]Red team, Kaplan points.
[59:17.50]So, what are they called now?
[59:18.82]Team Alpha, Team what?
[59:21.01]Team Alpha now is Team Jerma versus Team Sterma, baby.
[59:25.99]Okay, so tell me which one is which now.
[59:30.02]The red team is Team Jerma, yeah.
[59:33.33]Blue team is Team Star, I know that to be true.
[59:36.58]Alright, alright.
[59:37.90]We're going to get the Ubers.
[59:38.60]3 on 3 situation, but Red, a bit of an advantage because they are invulnerable to damage.
[59:43.39]Unbelievable.
[59:43.79]And they're going to recap the point and actually just assert more dominance.
[59:47.92]Tyrone's team did have a little bit of push, though, at 211.
[59:51.00]Now, for King of the Hill, we saw this, I think, earlier on.
[59:54.83]I think we played this in the 66th today, the EU versus NA portion of the cast.
[59:59.74]Instead of just a stopwatch, first team to count that time down from three minutes to zero wins.
[60:05.14]And we see Hai getting some work in, backstabbing Mack, who is used to backstabbing other people.
[60:10.67]Sam Lingle is turning the corner, just putting heavy bullets into everybody that stands in his way.
[60:16.22]Blue did cap, but they got out.
[60:18.64]Ninja Nick trying to build.
[60:19.50]He now has regular Uber.
[60:20.80]Sal, he learned his lesson.
[60:22.45]He will not crit Tyrone anymore.
[60:25.42]Yeah, that's probably one of the first lessons anybody learns in TF2 whenever they play with Tyrant.
[60:30.09]We do have Red Team kind of on the back foot right now.
[60:31.95]They are losing that point, so they have a minute ahead in the times.
[60:35.28]They've just got to wait for Oplad, Oplayed, to get back up to help this push.
[60:40.25]Or, you know, they've got the Uber.
[60:41.19]They could push it in right now.
[60:42.03]They've got no advantage, though, so all they'd be doing is forcing the Uber at a ninja.
[60:46.06]I don't know.
[60:46.70]I was going to say, we should flip it real fast to Tyrone.
[60:49.89]Tyrone Combs on that team.
[60:51.36]See how he's going to handle his regular Uber.
[60:52.86]I think that's all he needed.
[60:53.88]Let's get the end of this Uber.
[60:55.35]Oh, Tyrone's already dead.
[60:56.69]Well, he would not do that, Lang.
[60:57.97]Sorry.
[60:58.21]We'll switch to Combs for the next big Uber.
[61:00.48]In the meantime, we start.
[61:01.70]Still fighting it out, three on four situation.
[61:03.43]Red with a big advantage.
[61:04.45]Ninja Nick is gonna tow his demo back towards their spawn.
[61:07.98]Elf is gonna roll some of those demo bowling balls their way and 50 seconds and counting.
[61:12.91]It's a pretty close round.
[61:14.69]Only 40 seconds behind are the blue team, but they definitely need to get up and get on that point.
[61:19.91]Yeah, they're having to work through a lot of spam right now, and it looks like that's Seagull getting around behind the enemy team, so gotta be careful about that one.
[61:27.16]Yeah, let's flip it right now.
[61:28.26]Tyrone's medic has 95% uber.
[61:29.85]We're gonna see if he's gonna be able to keep his medic alive and have one of those classic Tyrone ubers.
[61:35.59]No, they're in the left corner.
[61:37.28]Wait, uber.
[61:38.86]Catch me.
[61:39.58]Nice catch.
[61:41.04]Get the cap here.
[61:43.22]Let's do it.
[61:45.58]Nice.
[61:46.40]Flare on me, right side.
[61:50.93]He's dead.
[61:52.83]You guys pushed right?
[61:53.62]I'm jumping right.
[61:54.42]I'm getting back, I'm getting back.
[61:57.94]We have advantage now, 30.
[61:59.15]Yeah, it's 40%.
[62:00.55]I'm playing back.
[62:01.37]Tyrone, we don't have numbers.
[62:02.45]Alright, that's cool.
[62:03.78]Heavy's coming in, Colm is coming in right side right now.
[62:08.17]That wasn't funny.
[62:09.46]No, that wasn't funny, but it was pretty much... I've heard that before.
[62:13.41]The old, okay, let's pop the Uber.
[62:15.53]Oh, I missed the easy rocket.
[62:17.11]Got the scout.
[62:19.10]Clockwork's going to kill everybody else on the enemy team.
[62:21.98]That guy's down, this guy's down, that guy's down.
[62:23.57]Look at Clockwork, 16 points.
[62:24.85]Medic has 13.
[62:26.27]Just going crazy, Mr. Salomancer.
[62:29.08]He is, man, and I think we ought to keep that camera on him as much as possible.
[62:31.65]He's actually taking a lot of the med heals right now, which, of course, you heal your most valuable players, and that is kind of what's happening at the moment.
[62:37.84]Clockwork is going to start trying to repush this against the red team.
[62:40.22]Doesn't want them to get this cap anytime soon, because if they can hold onto it for another 33 seconds, they will win this round.
[62:46.60]I do want to point out, by the end of this round, we did pass $90,000.
[62:50.89]Congratulations, everybody.
[62:52.71]That's awesome.
[62:53.63]Unbelievable stuff.
[62:54.91]Let's keep it going.
[62:55.79]100k is definitely in our sights here.
[62:59.30]Times are going to pass each other at 18 seconds.
[63:01.98]Blue still holds the point, and their time is counting down.
[63:04.48]I hear the ambassador popping off shots.
[63:06.75]Tyrone is going to kill Seagull for the most improbable kill of the day.
[63:11.17]It looks like Red's last two members are going to try to make something happen.
[63:14.06]Kevin Cupcakes Mackey has pushed the point, and there is High again, just sticking that knife in his back.
[63:20.26]Um, high is gonna go down, but times four, Sal.
[63:22.59]Actually, Red is able to recap, and Blue's not in a great position with their spawns.
[63:26.77]The heavy, Oclad, is moving up.
[63:28.59]He's gonna be, uh, revving up that big ol' Bertha big gun.
[63:32.28]Natascha.
[63:32.90]No, not Natascha.
[63:33.70]Sasha is gonna be ready to go, and I don't know.
[63:35.86]I think Red's got this.
[63:37.26]Oh, clockwork's down.
[63:38.71]Uh, Blue not probably gonna be able to hold this one too well.
[63:41.17]They are losing players rapidly.
[63:42.41]It's four against four, though.
[63:44.31]Can they make a push happen?
[63:45.31]I don't think they lost Zalox, and that is gonna be it.
[63:47.36]Red wins the first round.
[63:48.48]Nice and close.
[63:49.44]I like it.
[63:50.50]I want to point out real fast, we'll truck truck show the chat, Mackie, he's got something to say there.
[63:56.07]For those who missed the old binds, like I did, that brings smiles.
[64:00.21]The hamburger face.
[64:01.66]Oh, goodness.
[64:03.42]Quick shout out, we do have the auction winners starting to donate.
[64:06.58]FattyGuy, I believe, won one of the star auctions and the tag auction and donated $710 twice, I believe, so props to him.
[64:13.91]We're getting the other auction winners to donate soon.
[64:16.29]Nice.
[64:17.25]Awesome.
[64:17.59]That is great news.
[64:19.13]We're at mid-fight number two here.
[64:20.88]And it looks like the blue team is basically out of this fight already.
[64:23.34]The heavy's done quite a bit.
[64:24.54]Oplat isn't high up on the scoreboard, but he is getting his hand in a lot of kills as Clockwork is able to drop Seagull, who is always being aggressive, is Seagull.
[64:32.67]And the blue team is going to have to back off.
[64:34.73]I was going to say that high is probably a hard match for him to find something, but he's doing alright.
[64:39.56]Looking at the scoreboard, Mr. Big Tyrone is going to have to step up his game here.
[64:43.21]Hi, it's doing alright.
[64:44.51]I tell you what was kind of sad was I saw him get caught out there early on at the mid fight back before Before he had any sort of chance now looks like he's found a good spot to decloak.
[64:52.63]He sees the heavy He's gonna go for it doesn't manage to get that one does at least force a pop on the river and then butterknife's deadbolt
[64:59.42]Just pricked him in the toes there and got Deadbolt to die.
[65:03.07]Got a little easy stab.
[65:04.83]And Blue's in a nice little push.
[65:06.39]They're going to retake the point.
[65:08.03]222 on the clock, not counting, but 222 left for Red.
[65:11.72]And fresh 250 and counting for Blue, see if they can run off some time.
[65:15.54]Let's go listen in to the comms here.
[65:17.20]We've not heard from the Red team yet.
[65:18.76]We've got the Fragile, we've got Seagull, we've got the gaming legend Sam Lingle.
[65:23.47]We'll hear what they're thinking about right now.
[65:25.59]They are up 1-0.
[65:26.21]Pushing on the left.
[65:28.99]Oh I just got revolvered, holy shit.
[65:31.73]Probably, I don't know.
[65:32.99]Rotate right maybe.
[65:33.77]Sizer's in our spawn, mid.
[65:35.60]He's going to our spawn.
[65:37.36]That's a free pick.
[65:39.28]Oh, he's coming in on top of me.
[65:40.72]Oh my god.
[65:41.66]Wow.
[65:42.89]Okay, that's two picks, we can still push without our mags.
[65:46.73]Tell me which side you're going in on, and I'll push.
[65:48.93]Yeah, rocket's at the back, both of them.
[65:52.24]Moving in on the right.
[65:53.92]I'm behind them right now.
[65:54.94]They're on the far left.
[65:56.80]I'm still behind him.
[65:57.70]I'm main.
[65:58.76]I'm main.
[65:59.50]I killed the spy.
[66:01.50]It's the bane of the heavy's existence right there at the end cell.
[66:07.67]I'm a spy!
[66:11.11]Look at that teamwork.
[66:11.85]Do you see the teamwork between Clockwork and Sizer there?
[66:13.90]Dropping the fragile down.
[66:15.28]A little bait and switch.
[66:16.44]Really nice.
[66:17.00]He's heating up.
[66:18.22]He was heating up.
[66:19.46]Although I think Clockwork got the kills.
[66:21.48]How long were you waiting for that one, Star?
[66:24.09]I still might do it a few more times.
[66:26.08]Is there any catchphrase for anybody on my team?
[66:30.71]You can do that hamburger face for Mackie.
[66:32.90]I don't know what that sounds like.
[66:35.17]You're a creative guy, you can come up with it.
[66:37.99]Looks like the blue team is fighting off a big chunk of time here.
[66:41.75]They're gonna be about a minute ahead now.
[66:43.10]Here comes the uber from blue.
[66:44.52]Oplat is gonna go down, heavy down.
[66:46.62]But that's what they wanted to have happen, did red.
[66:48.53]Well, they wanted to just win instantly, but they're gonna settle for popping the uber, because if you look back in the red spawn, there is a medic who has just built his uber, the fragile, and his kitty face.
[66:57.24]They're ready to go out, and they're gonna go
[66:58.54]their right door into this midpoint.
[67:01.09]They've given up a lot of time, Sal.
[67:02.51]They are down a minute and 20 and counting, but with this uber advantage, they should be able to, at the very least, get in and recap this point.
[67:10.16]Yeah, Sizer's still playing a spoiler.
[67:12.62]He's been running around behind for quite a while now.
[67:14.14]He's spotted the heavy.
[67:15.45]He's going to get a lot of damage done, and there goes Oplad.
[67:18.51]So Sizer's going to feel happy about that one.
[67:19.97]Got the nice triple meat shot into the heavy before going down himself in the middle of this chaotic fight.
[67:25.88]Wow, big plays by Seagull.
[67:28.26]Just such a great player, great roamer, always dropping damages.
[67:31.65]Xalox is going to go down late into that fight, and Red has a nice situation.
[67:35.01]They could get set up here, trying to go 2-0 and bring it back, one for the Jerma.
[67:41.90]Hey, get a nice stab there on Seagull.
[67:43.66]He's going to stop that spam going through the door and feel pretty good about that.
[67:47.18]It's good to see the spy getting something done here.
[67:49.08]It's a good map for spies, really, with the chaos.
[67:52.79]Especially if the other team has a heavy, and we've already heard Sam Lingle being not so happy.
[67:57.31]Oplad with the knife in his big Russian back.
[67:59.52]And there he is again.
[68:01.62]He's heating up with that knife.
[68:03.06]Dropping the big man there.
[68:05.99]Four on five situation.
[68:07.19]Blue pushing up.
[68:08.03]They're going to recap and
[68:09.22]43 seconds and counting.
[68:10.70]They did choke out last round.
[68:12.80]They were up with a lot of time on the clock, but they choked out.
[68:16.43]So we'll see if they're able to hold on this time.
[68:18.65]The ambassador continually popping off shots.
[68:20.97]They have Uber.
[68:22.25]Let's go to the war room comms.
[68:23.68]I want to listen in on the blue side and see what they're going to do with their advantage.
[68:30.67]Everything stopped right.
[68:32.89]Here they come.
[68:34.29]They're putting time on point.
[68:35.23]Here comes Soldier.
[68:36.23]Nah, they have uber.
[68:37.02]They have uber.
[68:37.78]We're popping.
[68:38.60]I'm using.
[68:39.24]Soldier down.
[68:39.72]Soldier closet.
[68:40.90]Make their med pop.
[68:41.84]Med pop super late.
[68:43.14]Soldier's dead.
[68:44.20]Is tank team right?
[68:45.35]I'm dead.
[68:45.65]I'm right side.
[68:46.31]Heal's are right side.
[68:47.15]We're pushing into them.
[68:47.99]I'm okay.
[68:48.59]I'm going on.
[68:50.75]Sizer's on them right now.
[68:51.59]Their med's hurt.
[68:52.42]I'm dead.
[68:52.68]I'm dead.
[68:53.10]Scout's right there.
[68:54.26]Oh, medic.
[68:55.36]Nice.
[68:56.74]Dude, let's just go right away.
[68:59.44]It's a Soldier and a Scout.
[69:00.66]Soldier's hurt.
[69:03.38]Soldier's hurt.
[69:06.56]Where are we?
[69:07.07]Get together.
[69:07.73]I'm just spamming.
[69:08.79]I'm coming right side.
[69:17.18]Tyrone, as usual, has the worst mic background ever.
[69:20.12]It sounds like he had the TV on in the background.
[69:22.87]Yeah, it's probably one of his many weird friends.
[69:26.67]Oh, is he really?
[69:28.53]I didn't hear it.
[69:30.46]It was like all distorted.
[69:31.46]Okay, well, get to Tyrone.
[69:33.10]And Sizer with the med kick, by the way.
[69:34.86]It's almost like he's heating up.
[69:37.45]Blue team is going to win the second round there, and they're going to tie it up one to one here.
[69:40.67]We did see the time limit be put on to 20 minutes, so we have seven minutes left.
[69:45.14]I'm not sure if that's just going to end the round or if that round will finish out.
[69:48.64]I'm not 100% sure how that works, but we're tied up, so going to mid-fight number three here, so...
[69:54.58]Yeah, I don't know.
[69:55.36]Does that mean this is the last round?
[69:56.57]Because it very well could.
[69:57.45]We've got a Kritzkrieg out of the Fragile this time.
[69:59.48]That could be an interesting thing to watch.
[70:00.76]He's just kidding, Tyrone.
[70:02.06]It's not a Kritzkrieg.
[70:02.77]He didn't hear that.
[70:04.47]I love to see the critted Heavy.
[70:09.38]I think it's just so fun.
[70:10.52]Mackie's going to go down on the side to Sizer.
[70:12.74]It's happened a few times to him before.
[70:14.76]Blue doesn't really have much presence on the point.
[70:16.56]The Heavy can just kind of walk up there, really.
[70:18.06]Nothing that's going to stop him.
[70:19.75]Fragile does go down, so that'll make the Heavy significantly less valuable as he gets gibbed out by the bowling ball of Zalox.
[70:27.83]And Blue's going to recap.
[70:28.57]So nice play by them.
[70:29.31]They just kind of held back and we pushed in once the Medic was down.
[70:32.48]Pretty technical stuff.
[70:34.22]So we gotta start trying to confuse Tyrone since he's listening in now, right?
[70:37.29]I know, I was thinking the same thing, but... Looks like the fragile's running the Quick-Fix.
[70:41.09]I think we just got over a $2,000 donation, by the way.
[70:44.51]Those are for the auction, luckily.
[70:46.34]That was for the winner of Starz Sniper Rifle, the anonymous donor.
[70:49.94]He would like to remain anonymous.
[70:51.20]He followed through and donated $5,100, I believe, was the winning bid.
[70:54.17]He had to use two separate PayPal transactions.
[70:56.23]Are you serious?
[70:56.95]Huge shout-out to him.
[70:57.63]We're about $4,000 shy of $100,000 here.
[70:59.95]How am I gonna get it back now?
[71:03.53]We were so close to that goal.
[71:05.08]100 grand even.
[71:07.62]That would put Tip of the Hat so far up on the leaderboards of awesome charity things.
[71:12.21]You don't even know.
[71:13.07]You don't even know.
[71:14.04]Help out.
[71:14.74]Dig deep.
[71:15.38]Get your friends to watch and hopefully we can reach that goal.
[71:19.13]That's so cool.
[71:20.11]Anonymous, whoever you are, you are the best.
[71:22.59]Star, what does it feel like for someone to pay that much money for one of your items?
[71:25.86]That is so far over expectations of how I thought that sounded.
[71:28.98]I was guessing maybe like $1,200, somewhere around there.
[71:32.94]Just, I'm speechless on that one.
[71:36.03]That's amazing and for a great cause.
[71:38.21]You got a great snipe rifle and helped out like two and a half kids.
[71:42.96]Yeah.
[71:44.14]That half kid.
[71:45.34]That poor guy.
[71:46.32]The small one, the bloodsire kid.
[71:47.64]No legs, but he's going to camp.
[71:50.06]Okay, Sean.
[71:51.62]Oh, God.
[71:53.14]Alright.
[71:53.67]Well, in the meantime, Blue runs out to a minute and a half lead.
[71:58.68]Only 10 seconds left.
[72:00.48]The clock, four red.
[72:01.52]They are in trouble.
[72:02.40]Fragile has his crit screen.
[72:03.85]Actually, he has a Quick-Fix time.
[72:05.05]It's a Quick-Fix time.
[72:06.95]Bomb him right now.
[72:08.72]Or not.
[72:09.10]He's just going to get piped out by Alpha, so eh, we're not tied.
[72:12.29]Kind of want to listen to more War Room here.
[72:14.07]The Uber has just been popped.
[72:15.75]Why don't we listen in on Red if they're able to back out here?
[72:17.87]I don't want them to get wiped.
[72:19.18]Fragile's going to have a crit.
[72:20.20]Hopefully, he's got 25% more towards his crits with a saw onto Clockwork.
[72:24.42]So yeah, let's listen in on the Red guys, see how they're doing.
[72:26.73]We have crits, by the way, like in 10 seconds.
[72:28.53]Watch out for the spies on our side.
[72:29.55]He said I definitely need to be pushing.
[72:30.77]There's only three of them.
[72:32.71]Yeah.
[72:33.91]Sizer was surrounded here, so he's behind us.
[72:40.28]We have crits, so I don't know what you want to do with it.
[72:42.48]He's on cliff.
[72:43.34]He's probably close.
[72:47.83]There's a scout on me.
[72:52.74]Scout and a rock are down.
[72:54.34]Tyrone down again with a crit.
[72:57.11]Sizer's heating up!
[73:01.64]Did you get banded out of the gun?
[73:03.06]I don't know if they heard that.
[73:04.53]I hope they did.
[73:05.53]I hope they did.
[73:06.35]It's a mental breakdown right now.
[73:08.17]Scyther able to drop the Fragile, I think, at the end of that.
[73:10.67]It's one of those times when just pushing was good enough, but they just so happen to have Chris, which helps.
[73:14.94]And that's going to win him the point for now.
[73:16.70]Team Jerma trying to fight back.
[73:18.36]This is the all-important round.
[73:19.54]I believe this is going to be the last round of this set.
[73:22.27]We shall see.
[73:23.69]Oplan is going to go down, and yet again to Heso.
[73:25.95]Usually, Oplan would be one of those really smart gamers who wouldn't let his fight dominate him like that, but he's rusty, it appears, Sal, because he's got backstab quite a bit.
[73:35.12]Well, yeah, and he's playing a very, very fast-paced, you know, 6v6 game where he doesn't have time to keep tabs on where that spy is all the time, and the rest of his team not always doing a great job of it either.
[73:44.03]Hey, of course, one of the best spies out there, and that's why everybody wanted to see him play, so I'm happy.
[73:49.44]Yeah, he really is.
[73:50.62]It's good to see him doing well, cloaking around.
[73:52.51]He's able to use that ambassador, too, just constantly being a nuisance, trying to headshot the medic from afar and
[73:58.71]oftentimes succeeding in that front.
[74:00.70]We do have a Kritzkrieg again in the hands of the Fragile, so we heard Alpha say, I got Tyrone again, so we'll see if he's able to do that.
[74:06.76]10 seconds left on the clock, so Red has to go.
[74:09.35]Of course, Ninja Nick just has his Uber.
[74:10.87]He's gonna pop it right into Fragile's Kritzkrieg.
[74:13.25]Fragile's just somehow still alive, not anymore.
[74:15.71]It does get dropped off.
[74:16.80]Oplad stabbed in the back again by Hai.
[74:19.62]I would love to know how many backstabs Hai's gotten on the big man, because it seems like a lot, and we are in overtime, and we have a winner.
[74:26.93]So there actually is two minutes left.
[74:29.73]So I'm going to have to get a ruling from either Wang.
[74:31.80]No, last round.
[74:32.76]That was the last round?
[74:33.76]That's the last round.
[74:34.90]Okay, so GG.
[74:35.59]GG indeed.
[74:37.05]That was an excellent game.
[74:38.83]Looks like we have 2-0 now for Ster.
[74:42.20]Do we have the Sizzlers from that match?
[74:44.66]Yes.
[74:46.05]Please tell me they're the Sizzlers.
[74:48.13]Just for me, I'm curious.
[74:51.49]Some curiosities going on here.
[74:53.17]That was a great match.
[74:53.88]I was actually really excited to see Hai do as well as he did.
[74:56.94]I thought there was a chance, but who knows in this type of situation where you don't normally see a spy full-time, but you don't usually see a full-time heavy either.
[75:05.73]Probably helped a little bit.
[75:07.55]Yeah, that was a good game.
[75:09.39]GG's all around.
[75:10.89]Great game, guys.
[75:11.69]I am going to bring in a special guest.
[75:14.40]Hello, Robin.
[75:15.36]Are you there?
[75:17.22]Yeah, I'm here.
[75:18.08]Alright.
[75:18.72]You are now in the live casting channel.
[75:20.30]We're still live or in between games right now, but I just wanted to introduce you to the casters into the chat, guys.
[75:25.53]This is Robin Walker.
[75:27.07]He works for Valve currently.
[75:28.94]Is that correct?
[75:30.21]Yep.
[75:30.95]And you were one of the early workers, or did a lot of early work on TF2, and you now currently work on Dota 2, right?
[75:37.50]Yep.
[75:39.79]Wow, that's awesome.
[75:41.73]Yep.
[75:42.35]Yep.
[75:43.77]Robin Walker, we have raised $96,000 and counting toward basically using your game that you made, what, seven years ago as a vehicle that you helped make.
[75:51.99]How does that feel?
[75:53.83]I think this is the best thing that ever came out of TF.
[75:57.72]The game has survived for so long with a passionate fan base, both in the competitive and the pub level.
[76:03.66]Did you expect when you guys first made the game that it would turn into this cult classic that people just loved for so long?
[76:14.90]Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
[76:16.28]No, of course we didn't expect this.
[76:17.86]I mean, you just hope it works out.
[76:22.05]Okay, so, I mean, I don't know, chat?
[76:25.47]Chat's going crazy because Robin Walker's here, and obviously a lot of them have put hundreds of hours into TF2, and they, I'm sure, have questions for you.
[76:32.36]But if there's something I can find through the spam of chat, I'd love to ask Robin Walker a question for you, chat.
[76:37.67]Does anyone else have anything they want to say to Sal?
[76:39.67]Sal?
[76:39.90]Yeah, I mean, I met Robin once briefly when I was out in Valve headquarters, and my only impression of him was, oh, this guy's just kind of a genius.
[76:49.00]Like, I can't catch up.
[76:49.88]What are you saying?
[76:50.76]But, Robin, we do, you know, we had a couple of people put together this huge Dota 2 Team Fortress, like, crossover graphic, especially Lang and, gosh, what have we got, Sockpuppet did a lot of that.
[77:02.92]Have you gotten to pay attention to that at all?
[77:05.37]No, I came in late.
[77:06.37]I'm actually really looking forward to... I'll watch this on Twitch later.
[77:10.85]I'm really interested to see how it works out.
[77:15.68]Well, thanks for stopping in, man.
[77:17.34]Sally, you've met Robin.
[77:18.18]I want to ask a question for you really quick.
[77:19.65]What does he smell like?
[77:22.07]You know, he smells like kangaroos and snake meat.
[77:25.17]It's very manly.
[77:26.53]And hats?
[77:28.38]You know, I think that's what they make the hats out of.
[77:30.38]Is that what your accent is, Robin?
[77:33.10]You're Australian?
[77:35.00]Sorry, I couldn't hear that.
[77:35.80]What was that?
[77:36.64]Your accent's Australian, is that correct?
[77:39.02]Yes, yep.
[77:41.21]I don't know how much time we have before, Robin.
[77:44.03]I don't want to stress you out here too much.
[77:47.03]We have a couple questions from chat, good ones.
[77:49.84]People want to know about, I guess the one that comes to mind right now as I'm reading this is Kaboomsicle wants to know how proud you are of TF2's success so far.
[77:59.18]Sort of asked you that earlier, but what's your impression on how the game has grown over time?
[78:04.41]I mean, it's sort of hard to wrap your head around.
[78:07.08]I mean, you know, we never had any expectations.
[78:09.86]We just hope people would have fun with it.
[78:12.26]I think it's things like this and things like the recent story.
[78:17.83]I can't remember the exact web page.
[78:19.11]Oh, CritCast's story on the Meet Your Makers about the contributors.
[78:23.88]I mean, that's the sort of stuff that I think makes us most excited to work on the game at Valve.
[78:29.21]That's just awesome stuff to see.
[78:31.82]And now you've been on a different project from TF2 for quite some time now, is that right?
[78:37.69]Yeah, I've been on Dota 2 the last, I think, about two, three years now.
[78:41.75]So, in those last two, three years, a lot of changes have come, not just with items, but with the game itself.
[78:47.26]I'm sure you've kept track on how your game has evolved, or the game you've worked so hard on has evolved.
[78:52.80]In the last two, three years, have you been happy with the progression of the game?
[78:56.95]I don't even really think of it as my game or anything like that.
[79:00.73]I think you guys started owning it a long time ago, so I think you're far better judges of it than I would be.
[79:09.50]I mean, there were many times over the years that we thought the game should be a certain way and it was clear players felt it should be some other way and they were right.
[79:16.89]I think I have probably as much fun watching as you guys do playing it.
[79:23.11]That's awesome.
[79:24.94]Well, chat, I... Can I get into that server?
[79:29.77]You wanna get into the... You wanna be put on the Dota list, pick you for the next team?
[79:33.67]That would be awesome.
[79:34.31]Oh, I see Sizer on the other team.
[79:36.00]He's not very good.
[79:36.94]I think I can take him on.
[79:37.98]You're way better than him.
[79:38.66]He can easily sub you in.
[79:40.20]He's heating up, though.
[79:41.46]Everybody trashing on me today.
[79:43.37]I did hear he was heating up.
[79:46.47]I was heating up earlier.
[79:49.24]Robin Walker comes in and trashes Sizer.
[79:51.12]I love it.
[79:51.72]Paul, you're the best.
[79:52.86]Um...
[79:53.51]Are you serious?
[79:54.11]If you want to play, we'll get you in here.
[79:56.39]Yeah, I'm happy to play.
[79:57.44]I might cheat, but I'll play.
[79:59.60]I was going to say, are we going to see the crit rockets rain?
[80:03.69]Because I've heard some stories about Robin Walker's powers in TF2.
[80:08.05]Oh, man.
[80:08.57]It's possible.
[80:09.90]I think Jerma's team is going to need you.
[80:13.00]I get Robin Walker by default?
[80:18.01]Is that how it works?
[80:19.41]At this point, it sounds like a good idea.
[80:22.77]I have one question before we start this.
[80:26.08]I know I casted the TF2 mix-up that you played in with Notch and other people.
[80:30.62]Notch has his own in-game head hat, like the big block head like Minecraft.
[80:35.29]Do you have something like that for your character at any point?
[80:37.87]Are we going to see something special?
[80:39.55]No, we always make all the cool stuff for everyone else.
[80:42.46]Oh.
[80:43.86]Okay, well, maybe we'll see some magic out of Mr. Walker.
[80:47.86]Alright, boys, so how do we want to do this?
[80:50.01]We just put Robin on Jerma's team and we'll pick around it?
[80:54.21]We don't have that many people left.
[80:56.59]Actually, in second thought, Robin, have you ever been on a team for one of these events that has actually won?
[81:01.88]Despite the cheating?
[81:04.30]That hurts.
[81:06.24]I had to stop and really think about it.
[81:07.60]I was like, wait, is this a good thing?
[81:09.95]I don't actually recall, to be honest, but given that, the answer is probably no.
[81:15.21]Oh.
[81:15.89]We'll figure something out.
[81:17.34]We'll make it work.
[81:18.02]I believe the next map is GPit, so a lot of things can work on GPit.
[81:22.16]I think we're just gonna go, I mean it seems unanimous, we'll give Jerma Robin and then start picking around it.
[81:27.29]I don't know what you want to do because so many people have been banned and played already.
[81:30.12]If you want to reset it or pick off the people that are left, whatever.
[81:33.64]Seanbud, you know what you're doing.
[81:37.27]It looks like Lang's actually taken all of the previous players out, so I think everything that's left is what you guys got to work with.
[81:43.40]I think that's probably the best.
[81:44.60]The pool is much smaller.
[81:46.86]Why don't we just start with picks, and we'll just... I don't know if we even need to... Yeah, there's so many people gone, I don't think bans are even... Yeah, bans I don't think would be necessary right now.
[81:55.87]Alright, let's just have a fun one at the end.
[81:57.22]So, really sorry, I think a couple people won't get to play, irregardless.
[82:01.02]Sorry, a couple people, thank you for showing up.
[82:03.46]Um...
[82:04.12]I hope Lang is... Unban Fragile.
[82:07.35]He is going to medic the second one.
[82:09.11]I want to have two medics for this game.
[82:11.06]You know, that's wise.
[82:11.70]Okay, so why don't we just go ahead and start.
[82:15.69]Who actually physically picked first last time?
[82:17.92]I don't remember.
[82:19.78]I think it was me.
[82:21.52]I do think it was, but you got Robin.
[82:23.33]So you got Robin?
[82:24.07]Yeah, I got Robin.
[82:24.73]Yeah, you go first.
[82:25.69]Yeah, but Jeremy needs to win.
[82:27.09]Why don't we give him Robin?
[82:28.09]You know who cheats way more than Robin?
[82:30.92]I'm grabbing power without a doubt, without any question, no regret.
[82:34.62]Oh, smart move.
[82:36.79]I like that.
[82:37.45]So Robin's going to be playing Soldier, I'm assuming, right?
[82:41.77]You're a wild card.
[82:42.83]Depends on whether you want to win, I guess.
[82:45.40]Yeah, you can play whatever you want.
[82:47.08]Charge and charge demo one time?
[82:48.88]We'll throw him in there on Soldier, yeah.
[82:51.30]I guess for the graphic you can put Tyrone on because we love Tyrone so much.
[82:54.26]I was thinking I already had him picked.
[82:56.89]We finished each other's sandwiches.
[83:01.23]That's so cute.
[83:01.67]Okay, so Pawa is on the other team, so I guess it's your turn to pick again, Mr. Jerma.
[83:08.38]Alright, so if we're just going to go total wacko here.
[83:16.65]Well, I want you must, Mike.
[83:20.20]That's total wacko, you don't believe in Mike?
[83:22.44]No, no, no, no, I'm thinking in the future, for a future pick.
[83:28.11]Man, I gotta say, I'm concerned for power.
[83:29.75]This is like, like, Robin is here, there's a Valve team member.
[83:33.65]Like, this is the most real chance he's had to get banned.
[83:36.20]This is it, yeah.
[83:39.90]We're joking, Robin, we're joking.
[83:44.33]Um... Okay, so, next pick, Ster?
[83:46.15]Next pick, um...
[83:49.03]I'm going to grab my boy Sesko.
[83:51.94]Your boy Sesko.
[83:54.34]I don't think we need a ban, so we'll just go right back to you, Mr. Jerma.
[84:00.37]I'm going to go with Sigafoo.
[84:04.17]We're playing GPIT?
[84:05.49]Yeah, GPIT.
[84:06.57]Is it Sigafoo or Saiga-foo?
[84:09.06]Sigafoo.
[84:09.88]I mean, just be relaxed.
[84:12.16]Go ahead.
[84:14.80]Sigafoo, the edgy.
[84:17.31]Stirp.
[84:18.79]I am really tempted to grab Max.
[84:24.25]But I feel like... You can't have him vote.
[84:28.36]Just do it, man.
[84:29.28]No, don't do it.
[84:31.01]That's horrible.
[84:32.91]I don't know.
[84:33.47]With an Engineer and a Sentry on their team, I feel like that could be a huge problem.
[84:36.43]There's one demo on the board as well.
[84:38.40]Is that real?
[84:39.18]Can I get Pharoah?
[84:40.64]I would love to have Pharoah.
[84:43.59]Sounds fair, one team gets a demo and one team gets... Robin.
[84:46.48]I don't know, it's looking like it's skewing in my favor right now with power.
[84:48.48]Yeah... You said disappointed!
[84:49.16]Yeah... I mean, we probably need another medic back, maybe we can bring another demo in, I don't know.
[84:53.85]Just pick, you can have him if you want him.
[84:55.43]Yeah, I want Pharah.
[84:55.85]Alright, Pharah, you've been watching the draw.
[84:56.93]Congratulations.
[84:57.28]Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[85:07.71]I'll be taking Max.
[85:09.81]Nice.
[85:10.25]It's happening.
[85:12.17]Mr. Bloody Butte.
[85:21.30]You got GPit.
[85:23.43]If you were ever going to pick an engineer, this is the map.
[85:26.27]This is it.
[85:27.55]I was tempted to get Akuma.
[85:29.21]I feel like I can only get one more off-class here.
[85:31.20]Ooh, Spy on GP, that's another solid option.
[85:34.02]We got the NG.
[85:35.24]Get the Spy counter, get in Nash, sneak in, backstab Robin Walker.
[85:37.86]Is this also the first map Grape has not been banned?
[85:41.47]Oh, yeah.
[85:45.35]You have the Zebra and Wunderkind.
[85:47.08]You're too smart.
[85:48.12]I'm gonna... You know what?
[85:50.50]Yeah, Grape.
[85:50.98]Give me Grape.
[85:54.58]Alright, um...
[85:59.02]We'll need a medic.
[86:01.87]So, I'm going to go with... Is Fragile still on the board?
[86:06.45]Yeah, Fragile and Snacker are the medics.
[86:08.76]I will take Fragile again.
[86:09.94]He was pretty damn good.
[86:15.49]It's the day of the spies.
[86:20.44]I got to get Akuma.
[86:21.82]I feel like I need to.
[86:24.72]Akuma!
[86:24.89]Akuma!
[86:27.29]Okay.
[86:30.49]Jerma?
[86:32.65]Hmm.
[86:35.22]Alright, does he have six?
[86:36.54]You have six?
[86:37.26]Does he have six?
[86:38.54]There's five, right?
[86:40.40]Yeah, I think Tyrone's standing in as a picture for Robin there.
[86:43.33]So just Jerma, to tell you my advice, I would just pick the one that looks best.
[86:48.37]Sal, can you be in the same room as your mic, please?
[86:51.42]Yeah, thanks, Sal.
[86:54.54]He's like walking into the room now.
[86:55.86]I'll try, but... Okay, yeah, you did get one more sizer, so calm down.
[87:04.90]Am I picking now?
[87:07.10]I was waiting for Sal's expert advice.
[87:10.93]No, it was just to make sure that you pick the prettiest one.
[87:13.85]That's all I got.
[87:15.41]Pick the prettiest one?
[87:16.37]They're all pretty.
[87:16.90]That's right.
[87:22.00]Oh, there's so many pretty ones.
[87:25.98]I think, um... It's something I want to do, and I'm sure it's either going to be a good idea or a bad idea.
[87:34.43]I haven't decided that yet.
[87:35.87]It's a Jerm idea.
[87:37.39]It's a great idea.
[87:40.77]We're going to go with Pudding Cup.
[87:42.76]Pudding Cup.
[87:45.12]The Pyro.
[87:47.72]Same thing as a demo.
[87:48.76]Okay, Ster.
[87:50.82]I think I need that medic.
[87:52.77]Maybe.
[87:53.53]So, smack her.
[87:54.87]Oh, man.
[87:56.78]Big Dusty.
[87:57.40]Okay, sweet.
[87:58.74]I think we're ready to go.
[87:59.63]I'm pumped for this.
[88:01.33]We'll dish out the infos and is this our last
[88:05.97]sort of competitive game of TF2 for the tip of the hats?
[88:10.08]Okay, let's make it down.
[88:11.30]We have a pub hour next hour.
[88:12.49]We'll make sure to get the Robin cam going and we'll read off the raffle winners and everything.
[88:17.20]Real quick, we're about 5,000, or no, excuse me, 3,000 now short of 100k.
[88:22.61]Those last minute donations, that'd be incredible to break 100,000, guys.
[88:27.34]Yeah, totally.
[88:29.84]Okay, be fair though.
[88:30.63]I'll break out the rocket launcher.
[88:32.51]It's been incredible all the way through.
[88:34.72]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[88:35.34]Hold on.
[88:35.58]Go ahead.
[88:37.02]Sorry, I was just saying that I'll break out the rocket launcher once we hit 100K.
[88:43.30]Okay.
[88:44.88]Which means we won't win.
[88:45.90]If you want Robin Walker's team to win, please crack open your PayPals right now.
[88:53.05]If you don't know what he's talking about, the rocket launcher is fun personified.
[88:57.45]And I really want to see it.
[88:58.35]So please chat.
[89:00.36]If you ever love me.
[89:04.82]Alright, let's get the infos.
[89:06.06]Get people on the channels.
[89:06.98]Let's get this thing going.
[89:09.27]I'm excited, man.
[89:10.67]I'm excited too, Sal.
[89:11.87]I really am.
[89:14.62]Same server?
[89:16.50]Same bat server, same bat channel.
[89:18.71]I mean, not to take away from everybody who's already donated, of course, because getting to 100,000, it's not just the final people that we're imploring.
[89:25.77]It's everybody who's already built that pile of cash going off to charity.
[89:31.42]Just walking in and out of your room while you're talking.
[89:34.14]Yeah.
[89:34.56]Is your mic okay?
[89:36.25]No, I'm just pacing.
[89:37.03]Oh.
[89:39.59]Stop doing that.
[89:40.39]It sounds weird.
[89:42.11]Looks like we're getting donations to come in, so let's go, boys and girls.
[89:45.55]One more big push towards 100k.
[89:46.71]I know we can do it.
[89:48.50]Not sure if there are any more of those silent auction winners that need to donate.
[89:52.80]I'm not saying, yes, donate now.
[89:54.04]Give us your money, but I would love to see as much as possible come in for this final GPIT.
[89:59.19]And how appropriate.
[90:00.23]My favorite map, the best competitive map, it's GPIT.
[90:04.07]Can't wait.
[90:09.48]Still waiting.
[90:13.67]can't wait I mean I'm sure when style the way it's the worst part of testing is it never happens when you want that I'm a refresh the donations page real fast make sure that um... I didn't miss anything to shout it out maybe I can see that the guy who donated million dollars over has suddenly the amount raised is forty million dollars uh... that's uh...
[90:43.92]I got a $100 donation from Dot Executive.
[90:47.11]It says, Hat Fortress Forever?
[90:48.49]Thank you very much, sir, for the $100.
[90:51.46]Really appreciate it.
[90:54.28]Again, a lot of donations for the saying, let's get 100k.
[91:01.15]A lot of them, actually, in the last 20 minutes.
[91:04.20]I concur.
[91:04.70]Let's go for it.
[91:06.22]I believe that I still have one more donation left in me too.
[91:08.82]I never paid that, what was it, nine dollars or something?
[91:11.84]Ten, it was ten.
[91:12.88]I think I'll do a little bit bigger than ten.
[91:15.33]What does this say here?
[91:17.29]Mr. TMA, really probably shouldn't say your name, because you're the best.
[91:22.42]You know you're the best.
[91:23.26]You've donated, I don't even want to know how much you've donated.
[91:24.88]Was there an instance of the Fecal Conjurer?
[91:28.03]Yeah, he came in and donated a thousand dollars earlier.
[91:30.82]Oh, nice.
[91:31.54]I missed it.
[91:32.28]Shout out to the Fecal Conjurer.
[91:33.82]Yeah, Mr. Wizard came in and did his thing.
[91:37.53]TMA donated another $100.
[91:39.85]Not even leaving a comment.
[91:40.91]Actually, he does have a tilde.
[91:42.43]TMA, I don't know what to say, buddy.
[91:44.47]I would buy you a drink if you lived in my city.
[91:47.72]I have a $50 donation from X-Prestige.
[91:50.80]It says, shout out to the Colored Pylons and props to anyone involved in making this fundraiser happen.
[91:55.39]You guys are great.
[91:57.13]Thank you very much, X-Prestige.
[92:00.54]We actually have 12 people in the server.
[92:03.30]Mr. Salomancer, are you in here?
[92:05.86]You know, I'm as in here as I could possibly be.
[92:07.58]How's my sound?
[92:08.56]You're loud as can be, but you could literally scream as loud as you possibly can in my ear, and I'd be alright with it.
[92:14.61]You know, we probably shouldn't tell the entire stream what we do in our spare time.
[92:18.97]It's been a while.
[92:19.41]I thought that was private, but okay.
[92:24.32]For all you don't know, I love Sal deeply, and Sal tolerates my presence.
[92:27.84]It's kind of sad.
[92:29.75]I got a little crush on my guy.
[92:31.49]No, I miss Sal.
[92:32.41]I miss you, buddy.
[92:33.39]I hope we can hang out some more.
[92:36.06]Yeah, we should be able to.
[92:37.06]Things are going good.
[92:38.54]That's good.
[92:38.80]Alright, so who do you got winning this?
[92:41.29]Is Robin Walker going to pull the cheats out?
[92:44.11]You know what?
[92:45.80]That is just such a non-factor.
[92:48.08]The last time he pulled the cheats out, he still lost, so...
[92:51.77]I'm not putting a lot of power into that one.
[92:55.14]Let me see though, just going down the list again here, because you got one team with a demo, which is going to be, I tell you what, just owning the roof on point B is going to be extremely important.
[93:04.81]Robin Walker's running around right now demo nighting.
[93:08.36]Yeah, that's very him.
[93:09.74]That is him.
[93:11.68]I actually really expected that when he asked, like, am I going to play solo?
[93:14.01]I was like, you're going to play Demoknight no matter what we say.
[93:16.81]Right.
[93:18.09]He might be collecting some heads there, and he has literally the god mode in here if he wants it, so... I don't know.
[93:24.81]Will he let the people down?
[93:26.29]Will he let Jerma down?
[93:27.75]The great Jerma?
[93:28.57]You know, truth be told, I do regret not getting a engineer.
[93:33.20]At least the sentry could push him away.
[93:35.53]Yeah, push his bullets away.
[93:37.35]He's like, yeah, it's gonna be interesting.
[93:40.12]I don't know.
[93:40.54]We'll see.
[93:41.90]Do you have any cheats, Robin?
[93:43.89]Do you have a super sword?
[93:45.67]I think we moved him down.
[93:48.41]Yeah, he's in the team channel.
[93:49.75]We can definitely link it.
[93:51.59]I want to say he does have a super sword.
[93:53.81]I mean, maybe, yeah, maybe he does.
[93:55.26]His sword is on fire.
[93:55.80]Would you like me to bring him back in here?
[93:57.34]That's right, yeah, he has a special skin sword.
[93:59.32]It's on fire.
[93:59.80]I don't know if it does anything, though.
[94:01.88]It's like the William Wallace sword, I think.
[94:04.16]It's, you know, like Claymore or whatever William Wallace used.
[94:07.49]But Akuma's got a tiny little blade, and that's pretty good, so...
[94:11.67]I don't know.
[94:12.01]I like that pick with the spy.
[94:13.83]So traditional on GPit.
[94:15.32]It's gonna be fun.
[94:16.50]Smack up playing medic somehow?
[94:18.06]I guess that's his main class now.
[94:21.87]Yeah, it's been a thing for a little while, man.
[94:26.41]I know.
[94:27.05]I'm out of the loop.
[94:28.48]Jerma, you feeling confident with your team, buddy?
[94:31.82]Uh, yeah.
[94:33.12]Yeah, dude.
[94:36.33]As confident as I can be.
[94:38.77]Taking that to the bank.
[94:40.42]We did just get another Silent Auction total in.
[94:43.04]A nice $280 from the Stabby Silent Auction.
[94:46.03]Thank you very much, sir.
[94:46.92]I don't even say your name.
[94:48.28]I don't want to inconvenience you at all if you don't want it said.
[94:56.64]I don't know exactly what we're waiting for here.
[94:59.21]They're in the server maybe.
[95:01.57]Some sort of external programs need to be loaded from both teams for power and Robin.
[95:05.73]I don't know exactly how they use their cheats.
[95:09.10]Yeah, it's a lot of cheating in one server.
[95:11.80]Can it handle it?
[95:13.08]I don't know.
[95:14.02]Maybe Robin's doing his Braveheart, William Wallace soliloquy.
[95:18.77]Getting his troops pumped up for this battle.
[95:21.67]Probably all putting on face paint.
[95:23.69]Yeah, the blue paint.
[95:25.36]Are you ready for the war?
[95:27.27]Let me take our hats!
[95:29.17]They'll never take our freedom!
[95:32.80]I actually think that's happening, pretty sure so.
[95:36.36]Yeah, that with an Australian accent.
[95:38.30]Sean, you want to tell them, just in case they don't know, that they can actually go live?
[95:43.83]Sean Budd, always there for us.
[95:44.89]We do have many, many donations coming in.
[95:48.02]Mr. Dashner, old friend Dashner, sent a $20 donation that just says, Profits featuring Dashner.
[95:55.63]Thank you, Dashner, for the $20.
[96:00.14]We got a 99-cent donation from SELLING VALVE HACKS!
[96:06.29]I don't know, I don't know.
[96:07.49]I bet Robin can make some dough off of his god mode cheats.
[96:12.42]Yeah, you know, they tend not to like putting hats in the game without them going through a workshop first, as it turns out.
[96:18.19]I like Akuma's hat quite a bit, by the way.
[96:19.71]I've never seen it.
[96:21.53]Oh, is his the, uh... the... the wok?
[96:25.46]Yeah.
[96:26.72]I'm sorry, that's not a walk at all.
[96:27.98]I just, I'm terrible.
[96:29.43]Yeah, I know what you mean, though.
[96:31.27]Robin just got, like, ramp-stabbed right there.
[96:34.17]We got a $100 donation.
[96:35.65]$100 donation from Inixie.
[96:38.32]Says, shout-out to Wonderland.
[96:39.84]Much love to the Tip of the Hat's crew and all the work you guys have done in the past years.
[96:42.50]You guys should be proud.
[96:44.02]You're going to make many kids very happy.
[96:45.72]Thank you very, very much, Inixie.
[96:47.83]We really appreciate it.
[96:49.30]I have an announcement.
[96:50.34]This was kind of a surprise visit by Robin, and he's agreed to sign some stuff for us.
[96:55.85]There is one more auction.
[96:57.49]Everything else is over, but there is a Robin Walker signed items auction now on the Steam discussion.
[97:02.70]The link will be spammed in chat.
[97:04.20]Look for that.
[97:05.40]There's also an auctions link down below on the Twitch information.
[97:08.59]He's going to be signing a strange rocket launcher, shotgun, festive grenade launcher, sticky bomb launcher, Scattergun, and sniper rifle.
[97:16.28]He's signing all of those.
[97:18.90]get your bids in for that we will uh close that auction at the end of the stream uh approximately 1am eastern I think it's gonna be a late one but uh uh anyways get that get your last minute bids in I don't know how often he signs things but I'm guessing it's pretty rare I think I saw one of his things coming around um when I was collecting donations for our old show sal someone said it wasn't offering to give it to me he said that he had a robin walker item
[97:43.42]I think he said he was going to give it to a different charity to give away.
[97:47.73]That's awesome for Robin, and we are live here.
[97:50.16]Grave has the rocket jumper, in case you missed that.
[97:52.91]I had to point that out.
[97:53.89]He just jumped into the sentry.
[97:56.85]He utilized that.
[97:58.03]And Powa gets the first headshot onto Max.
[98:00.74]He's going to follow it up quickly with a second onto YouMustMike.
[98:03.66]So Powa is ridiculous.
[98:05.04]And you know what?
[98:05.54]This is my favorite part about GPit.
[98:07.15]The blue team is just fighting for their lives out at B right now.
[98:11.49]But look at Sesko.
[98:12.67]He's just hanging out at A, capping that thing.
[98:14.56]Got a care in the world.
[98:17.10]We got Robin trying to shut down POWA with the pipes, but sadly he does not have sticky bombs or anything that would actually be useful in this circumstance, so looks like he's gonna have some trouble.
[98:26.01]Gonna go after the spy with the big sword.
[98:28.54]Not gonna happen.
[98:29.94]Robin Walker rocking the 75 FOB, which is absolutely fine.
[98:33.19]You do not need any more than that.
[98:35.27]It just sometimes helps.
[98:36.57]Sometimes.
[98:37.03]But Robin Walker's a true boss.
[98:38.67]He doesn't need 90 FOB, boys.
[98:40.96]He's fine.
[98:42.62]Max is actually going to get the best of Pau there, and a second bodyshot kill into Pharoah as well, so Red is able to hold for now.
[98:50.73]The Red team is Jerma's team, so they are defending first.
[98:53.39]I don't think we've seen any GPIT during this stream yet, aside from the awful MGM, not MBM, the MGE Jerma versus Star, which is, of course, my bad for feeding the arena.
[99:04.72]I'm going to conjure it up like a horrible...
[99:06.24]I was just watching the Akuma cam and Akuma just totally tooled on Robin right there.
[99:10.97]Robin was not able to get anywhere close for the sword hits.
[99:13.52]Akuma was like, yeah, see you later.
[99:14.72]I don't even need to headshot that.
[99:16.87]Like I said, he's got that smaller blade pretty good.
[99:19.60]Max is gonna drop Smaka though, so Max keeping his team in it, dropping the Medic.
[99:24.40]The Powa is gonna get the best of Max here, so the sniper duel that everyone wanted to see.
[99:29.19]Perhaps the two best snipers in the world going at it right now.
[99:31.93]Red is still doing okay.
[99:33.02]The Fragile is milking his uber for all it's worth, but he's milked it to the point where his entire team is dead.
[99:38.62]Dropsy City for the Fragile.
[99:40.97]He's gonna have to run back and use his Uber just to get away, and I don't think he's gonna be able to do that.
[99:44.72]Grape is all over him.
[99:46.51]But no, Fragile able to surf away and get to last, but B is gone, Silomancer.
[99:51.72]Yeah, Kuma trying to get in there for the last minute.
[99:53.56]Sav, didn't happen.
[99:54.90]And he, uh, he did die.
[99:57.59]Alright, now we got Sesko trying to build Uber so they can push that point.
[100:02.02]And it's actually pretty close, I'm surprised.
[100:04.24]Uh, the Fragile did manage to get away, which is gonna save his team potentially on this point.
[100:07.42]Pudding, gonna stand up there with that, uh... You're Mike, you're out of this world.
[100:12.19]You kidding me, man?
[100:15.94]You have like a professional quality mic too, don't you?
[100:19.24]Isn't it like one of those with a spit guard and all that stuff?
[100:22.36]Yup.
[100:23.01]Spit guard.
[100:24.07]Gotta jiggle the connections, man.
[100:25.53]That sounds horrible.
[100:26.99]Sounds like you got the Walmart special or something.
[100:28.93]99 cent mic.
[100:30.80]Uh, okay.
[100:31.28]Well, hopefully Sal works that out.
[100:33.42]Uh, we're getting pressure on the top of C. I don't know if anyone's gonna get up there.
[100:36.72]Max the headshot, but it's too little, too late.
[100:38.71]3-0-4 is the time for Team... That was... That was way faster than I think you could have expected.
[100:45.59]3-0-4 is like an amazing time on GPid.
[100:47.72]I mean, it's beatable.
[100:49.96]But dang.
[100:51.18]It's beatable, but that's on the fast end of really fast, so we'll see.
[100:57.27]I don't even know what exactly went wrong.
[100:59.75]Well, no stickies.
[101:01.57]Problem.
[101:02.83]True.
[101:02.95]The Fragile dropped everybody a beat, which is another problem.
[101:06.58]Actually, taking a look here at the list of Jerma's team, the amount of people who could jump to the top of C to stop it from being capped is... Zero.
[101:16.15]Zero.
[101:16.65]Now they do have Robin Walker playing Soldier.
[101:18.70]We'll see how legitimate his rocket launcher is.
[101:22.25]Guys, if you want to see Robin Walker literally make it rain in this server, we're trying to get to $100,000.
[101:29.85]We're at $98,000 and change.
[101:32.78]If you can open up your wallets just one more time and want to see something absolutely epic, Robin Walker will make you smile, I guarantee it.
[101:39.89]And yeah, hopefully we can get that.
[101:41.37]We're going to start.
[101:42.54]Three minutes, so you basically have to win every fight.
[101:45.16]You maybe have one or two missed pushes in you.
[101:47.88]We'll see how they decide to do so.
[101:49.16]Looks like they're going to send some men to A. And Max is going to do the best he can at B. Sal, is your mic okay?
[101:55.83]You know, probably not.
[101:57.35]But that's alright.
[101:58.63]Yeah, it sounds okay now.
[101:59.74]I hope you...
[102:01.39]Uh, it's in and out, I've got Gedo Whale here.
[102:05.01]Hello.
[102:06.06]Hello, Mr. Gedo Whale.
[102:06.90]So are we summoning this- are we summoning Sal?
[102:08.82]Oh no, Michelle.
[102:10.08]Yeah, it's sad days.
[102:11.36]Uh, I guess he's having issues, but, um, yeah.
[102:14.19]Hi.
[102:15.61]I have a microphone.
[102:16.59]Well, thank you so much, Sal, for- for casting.
[102:18.68]Sorry, buddy.
[102:19.08]I- I don't know.
[102:19.86]The microphone... Just get the- just get the, uh, the- the egg or whatever I got.
[102:23.87]You can hang, you can hang.
[102:25.30]Oh, I'll hang for sure, man.
[102:27.38]This is enjoyable to watch.
[102:28.78]Okay, cool.
[102:29.59]We got Mr. Smacka, though, sitting on the Subaru right now.
[102:32.83]Yeah, well, we have two minutes and ten seconds of counting.
[102:35.80]A is down, so here comes the all-important push.
[102:37.66]Nice start, as YouMustMike is able to find Akuma and drop him down, so we'll see no spy for the beginning of this push.
[102:43.89]That's a Dead Ringer.
[102:44.89]There's a Dead Ringer?
[102:45.67]Oh, it shows up as dead on my thing, so he's not actually dead.
[102:48.86]Not a good start to the push.
[102:49.90]It's horrible.
[102:52.43]And it's not.
[102:53.09]We're going to see.
[102:54.56]Worst day ever.
[102:55.18]Worst cast ever.
[102:56.40]Kuma is dead ringed out.
[102:57.62]Maybe the attacking team is as dumb as I am and didn't know.
[103:00.90]Pyro is there shooting his flames around.
[103:02.97]And I'm not sure.
[103:04.19]They are going to meet in the C side of B where many competitive teams have met.
[103:07.83]And they're going to poke out.
[103:08.64]Max got his scope up, but he did not find a head.
[103:11.12]And it's not an easy shot there to get a whale from the top of that ramp.
[103:15.32]But they are going to get two or at least one.
[103:17.03]I'm not sure if Kuma is dead ringed or not.
[103:18.39]It looks like he actually is.
[103:19.27]So one down.
[103:20.13]It is Sesko.
[103:21.25]And we're 5-5 here.
[103:22.35]Yeah, mister, uh... Let's do that.
[103:26.76]Alright, well let's go listen in to, uh... Blue Team is in the process of getting wiped here, so I don't know if that's the best idea.
[103:33.15]We do have Max still.
[103:34.41]Let's do the War Room, I guess, of the Blue Team here and listen to... They have basically one push left, so they're gonna have to make this next one count.
[103:41.28]I don't know where.
[103:46.57]That's annoying to have to find.
[103:50.25]Yep.
[103:53.76]Nice.
[103:54.18]Nice.
[103:54.88]Helps if I link the right team.
[103:55.74]Let me try that again.
[103:56.70]What does it say?
[103:58.02]Why would you say that?
[103:59.71]All at one.
[104:00.11]I'm going to go long.
[104:02.43]They're shadow side now.
[104:04.19]I got... There's a... Cyber's at 80.
[104:05.93]Well, I mean 130.
[104:09.52]Oh, well.
[104:12.20]Alright, you and me, Nick.
[104:13.42]Alright, let's go, man.
[104:14.46]Yeah, let's go.
[104:15.31]Let's go long.
[104:15.93]Let's just go, man.
[104:16.77]See how it goes.
[104:19.03]Let's go against the world.
[104:19.79]Oh, I regret my decision.
[104:23.12]There's a lot of dudes here.
[104:24.00]I believe you, dude.
[104:27.03]I'm down.
[104:31.77]Looks like Smack is heating up!
[104:33.23]He's doing everything over there!
[104:37.10]There are a lot of dudes here, that could be the motto of TF2, I think.
[104:40.98]Immediately regretting this 1v6 decision.
[104:44.07]Uber's gonna get popped, that's it.
[104:46.13]Valiant effort for the blue team, they got A!
[104:49.23]That is it.
[104:51.15]At least they tried.
[104:52.35]We're not done yet.
[104:53.27]We got another round.
[104:53.97]They can come back.
[104:55.60]RTV.
[104:56.90]Rock the boat.
[104:58.54]Let's get a new map.
[104:59.42]Rock the boat.
[105:01.30]I'm wondering here, is Robin going to bust out a super secret weapon to turn the tide a little bit?
[105:05.89]He's been known to rock that.
[105:08.36]Yeah, we'll see.
[105:09.06]He's just got the equalizer right now.
[105:10.88]But he's got chops, I mean, on his own.
[105:12.26]He's a quake dude, and he's still got some rocket launcher chops.
[105:17.54]We'll see.
[105:18.02]I actually thought he'd use the original.
[105:19.69]I like his hat.
[105:20.31]He's got the Eiffel Tower.
[105:21.68]He was using the original unless he switched off it.
[105:24.14]Where is he at?
[105:24.95]He's got the original, yeah.
[105:27.21]Quick announcement, we just added a new final timed raffle.
[105:32.22]Lorik traded me an Australian minigun, and we're going to get that one signed by Robin, and it is the final raffle.
[105:39.41]If you donate $5 anytime until the end of the stream, you'll be eligible to win that.
[105:45.01]It's an Australian gold minigun signed by Robin Walker.
[105:47.92]That's at the end of the stream, not this segment, right?
[105:49.92]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[105:50.60]It's the only raffle left.
[105:51.66]All the other raffles are closed.
[105:52.90]Donate $5 to enter in the Robin Walker one.
[105:54.96]At least $5.
[105:57.57]Okay, cool.
[105:58.95]So they are going to... Yeah, the blue team is going to be attacking.
[106:02.92]Usually we have to switch that still.
[106:04.94]After all these years, we never figured out how to do attack and defend quite properly.
[106:08.49]We'll get there.
[106:09.69]There's time.
[106:10.55]I'm worried about the blue team here.
[106:13.27]We're doing another round, right?
[106:15.04]Yeah, we're doing another round at least.
[106:16.56]I mean, if the blue team wins, I don't know.
[106:18.20]The bane of many TF2 players' existence right here.
[106:21.80]Robin just switched rocket launchers, and he was in spawn a long time.
[106:25.47]I'm wondering if something's going on.
[106:27.25]It looks like a normal rocket launcher.
[106:29.05]Oh, he's going back.
[106:30.37]Okay.
[106:31.07]I think he's probably getting ready.
[106:32.65]Sizer's got the dot, dot, dot chat.
[106:34.68]He's expecting something crazy.
[106:38.08]Yeah, get a whale.
[106:39.42]I don't know.
[106:41.26]We've got a valid rocket launcher watch.
[106:42.44]He's only going to do it if we hit that 100.
[106:44.95]Yeah.
[106:46.04]We're getting close.
[106:46.98]We are getting closer.
[106:47.76]It is 1400 away.
[106:50.08]I don't know.
[106:51.64]Chat, this may not last that long.
[106:53.98]Hopefully, they're going to pop Uber and spawn.
[106:56.24]I don't think they've readied yet.
[106:58.39]They're not ready?
[106:59.67]Yeah.
[107:00.05]I just told them they're ready yet.
[107:01.85]Oh, weird.
[107:02.21]Okay.
[107:02.75]We'll see.
[107:04.23]Maybe Rob and Walker will go back to the magic gun.
[107:06.57]Yeah, he's chomping at the bit, I think, to get some shenanigans in here.
[107:11.04]Okay, so it is actually the red team is going to defend first.
[107:15.94]Like I said, usually this is the point where teams would switch sides, so the team that had to defend first would have to attack first to eliminate any randomness in that regard.
[107:25.79]But they're not going to do that.
[107:27.51]Uh-oh.
[107:28.61]Uh-oh.
[107:28.75]Oh, God.
[107:29.43]I just saw a thing happen.
[107:32.76]I was going to say, it looks like a normal original, but we have no idea.
[107:36.06]Maybe this is the Valve original being debuted today.
[107:39.18]We don't know.
[107:40.95]I don't know.
[107:42.81]I saw a thing.
[107:43.59]I saw someone ubered that wasn't supposed to be ubered.
[107:46.31]What is that?
[107:48.40]I don't know.
[107:48.68]Oh, goodness.
[107:49.68]What did he just do?
[107:50.86]He's previewing it, guys.
[107:52.06]It's preview.
[107:53.53]I am shaking.
[107:54.63]This is crazy.
[107:56.79]I am ready for some magic to happen.
[107:58.88]This looks like regular rockets to me.
[108:00.20]They're holding A, by the way.
[108:02.18]Maybe they're going for the Iron Man strat.
[108:03.72]Robin Walker, Iron Man strats?
[108:04.99]Why not?
[108:06.03]Next level.
[108:09.09]We're above 99.
[108:10.90]We're above 99.
[108:11.82]Oh, my God.
[108:13.50]Okay, so we are under $1,000 to our goal.
[108:17.39]Look at that number go way up.
[108:18.91]Donate those $5.
[108:19.95]Get that signed minigun.
[108:21.51]That is worth a lot of money.
[108:22.69]Robin Walker does not sign a lot of things as far as I know.
[108:25.38]And I really can't even tell what it's at right now because people keep donating $5.
[108:28.98]And please keep it up.
[108:30.46]Thank you so much.
[108:31.34]Like 700 away from 100K.
[108:33.95]Quick note, it is a slightly different play than time raffles.
[108:36.71]If you donate more during this time raffle, you are more likely to win.
[108:40.30]It scales linearly with the donation amount, I believe.
[108:43.30]Robby picked out the spy that time.
[108:44.65]That's pretty impressive.
[108:46.73]I picked out the spy that time, and that's not a Dead Ringer, so I'm not going to put my foot in my mouth this time.
[108:50.91]I refuse to.
[108:52.90]I think the spidey senses are kicking in at the very least.
[108:55.76]I don't know if that's a hack or a cheat.
[108:57.84]You're just born with that.
[108:59.63]It looks like Blue has figured out that there isn't much holding...
[109:04.43]Holding spawn, they're gonna try to take the next round.
[109:06.42]AA's so hard to defend.
[109:07.73]Grape took that gun down alone.
[109:10.30]Yeah, and he's put down Yuma's mic alone as well.
[109:13.48]Rape is pretty good.
[109:14.10]We saw him on his DM mods and various aim showcases.
[109:18.45]He's really, really good.
[109:19.29]What's our stats at right now?
[109:20.43]That's what I'm really concerned with.
[109:23.00]I want to see it go.
[109:24.16]We're about 300 away.
[109:25.90]I'm going to think Robin's watching that tally as well, and as soon as it happens, it's going to get busted out.
[109:30.95]Might as well remind him.
[109:31.81]Has he been informed?
[109:33.85]Yeah.
[109:34.33]Who's his idea?
[109:35.43]I'll let him know.
[109:38.56]We're not quite there yet, SeanBud, so chill out.
[109:41.09]Actually, yeah, we're pretty much there, SeanBud.
[109:44.01]There he comes.
[109:45.29]I'm looking over.
[109:46.07]I can't even see the numbers.
[109:48.07]It's always someone donating.
[109:49.79]Thank you so much, guys and gals.
[109:51.14]Less than 100.
[109:52.10]We've hit 100,000.
[109:53.62]Jerma!
[109:54.82]Hashtag, it's happening, buddy.
[109:56.22]It's happening.
[109:57.24]We're there.
[109:57.76]Do it, Robin.
[109:58.66]Do it, Robin.
[109:59.40]Turn it on.
[110:00.08]Turn on the cheats.
[110:01.08]Alright, well, let's get the camera on Mr. Robin Walker.
[110:03.93]By me, the camera, I mean my thing.
[110:05.47]Alright, the quote was, so I can cheat now?
[110:07.41]Awesome.
[110:09.61]Over.
[110:10.38]Ladies and gentlemen, $100,000 raised.
[110:14.80]Tip of the hats to unbelievable clap is all around.
[110:18.32]I'm going to clap with the mouse.
[110:19.79]That is so good.
[110:20.57]Let's find Robin Walker.
[110:22.13]And now the pregame is over and we've got the real, well, he's going a little bit faster than normal.
[110:26.67]I'd say running around right now.
[110:30.08]Oh my God.
[110:31.24]He's still taking damage.
[110:32.90]So, you know, that's a thing.
[110:36.23]I think his health might actually be not what it says it is.
[110:42.24]Oh my god.
[110:44.24]Oh my god.
[110:47.07]Robin, oh my god.
[110:50.05]I will donate a hundred dollars if Powah headshots him.
[110:52.76]I would die.
[110:55.36]I don't know.
[110:56.48]I'm thinking the head will just, like, palatable die.
[110:58.79]He's going for the flank, ladies and gentlemen.
[111:00.79]Robin Walker with his... The crits.
[111:09.52]Look at this DM, ladies and gentlemen, by Mr. Robin Walker.
[111:12.38]My goodness.
[111:13.76]TF2 easy.
[111:15.15]There's a reason he coded this game.
[111:16.81]He wants to show us all how it's done.
[111:19.60]Well, let's see Robin Walker, how far he's gonna take this.
[111:22.16]You want some, uh, War Room Super?
[111:23.24]Yeah, let's do the War Room.
[111:24.12]I'm sorry about that.
[111:25.28]Can we, can we get the, uh, the team that's getting crushed right now?
[111:27.83]The enemy team, yes, someone at that.
[111:29.81]We'll, we'll try to distract.
[111:30.89]Okay, we need to distract them.
[111:33.20]Alright, where is he?
[111:34.22]The sniper's close.
[111:36.08]I don't even know where he is.
[111:37.04]They're all there.
[111:37.76]He's so fast!
[111:39.03]Where are they?
[111:39.51]Oh my god.
[111:41.15]He's 150.
[111:43.39]Go for it, Akuma, it's yours!
[111:45.48]Fatal Snack, please!
[111:48.55]Watch out!
[111:50.62]No!
[111:50.86]He's 11 health!
[111:53.15]This pen did an uber summon.
[111:57.65]Smacka killed Robin?
[112:00.15]Unbelievable.
[112:01.61]That means he's the new Robin.
[112:03.52]He's going to spawn an extra full character size bigger and he's just going to rip walls down.
[112:09.08]Now can we raffle off that Ubersaw that Smacka just used?
[112:12.03]That'll be the next.
[112:12.95]It's melted.
[112:13.67]It's like not an item anymore.
[112:15.39]While we're at it, we might as well go to the war room and listen to Robin on his next life here when he spawns and see what he's got up his sleeve.
[112:22.08]Just tell me when to hit the cheat to make sure Owen's honorable.
[112:24.95]Oh, spy here.
[112:26.61]Spy on...
[112:28.33]Spy, spy's climbing.
[112:33.93]Sniper is 4.
[112:38.66]On the right here.
[112:40.58]I might be rotating center A. Scouts took 90 climbing.
[112:50.39]You want to go into them Pyro?
[112:52.09]You want your debut?
[112:53.19]Let's go into them, let's go into them, come on.
[112:56.15]Oh god, I didn't even know about that.
[112:59.97]What is happening?
[113:02.90]Oh it's fine you guys, it's fine.
[113:07.36]If he's not glowing, it's a spy.
[113:10.64]How's that for a quote?
[113:12.89]Oh, I was dying.
[113:14.43]I'm sorry.
[113:15.59]Tell me when to hit the cheat that makes you invulnerable.
[113:18.73]Hit the cheat to make us invulnerable.
[113:20.63]The deeper level of the whole thing that I love is that they're calming like this is still a competitive game and calling where people are.
[113:26.98]Working strats.
[113:28.38]Going up top.
[113:29.38]Yeah, he's on the top.
[113:30.17]Yeah, they're like all invincible.
[113:32.53]My favorite comment of the whole thing was like, he's not glowing.
[113:35.23]He's a spy.
[113:37.77]Oh my goodness.
[113:39.19]Okay, so I don't know if Robin has another trick.
[113:42.09]I've never seen the everyone vulnerable trick.
[113:44.37]I've seen the crazy rocket launcher.
[113:46.00]And I think that he can shoot a rocket that just blows up the server.
[113:49.24]Like, kills everything.
[113:50.28]Like a nuclear bomb.
[113:51.24]I think that's also in the repertoire.
[113:53.16]We'll see if that comes out on the other team.
[113:55.78]I say we go back to the blue side.
[113:58.29]The side that's getting destroyed right now.
[114:00.29]And listen in to what they're doing.
[114:04.15]I know.
[114:06.54]filled with shelter from let's go from the if we can't hold it again I was just a few if he is he's definitely he's living give up on the day is everything is fun with the people who can't afford to put this uh... all as teamwork
[114:29.19]Teamwork, make the dream work.
[114:33.36]That was a matador stab of all matador stabs.
[114:35.97]Oh my goodness.
[114:36.91]Hashtag the best.
[114:38.54]Somebody in the chat is pointing it out.
[114:39.74]They're very calm.
[114:41.42]They're just hanging out.
[114:42.52]They're just like, yeah, I will go up this way.
[114:45.55]This game has evolved.
[114:46.43]It's no longer about the objective on the map.
[114:48.97]You have to take down the boss.
[114:50.69]Well, Robin Walker well-timed pop on his mega cheat that makes everyone just kill everybody and remain invulnerable forever.
[114:57.44]Awesome plays by him.
[114:58.42]They're still using the Vaccinator resistances, though.
[115:00.32]He's just shooting everything for the spy.
[115:02.19]Still using that Vaccinator on red.
[115:04.63]Why not?
[115:05.81]Yeah, just get those resists.
[115:07.13]Why not?
[115:08.71]Yeah, I mean, you gotta take an extra 35% off of zero damage.
[115:12.45]Right, of course.
[115:13.67]We all know that.
[115:15.46]Barrow's gonna jump up and kill him.
[115:18.68]I think he can build a gigantic mega sentry gun, too.
[115:21.05]I think I saw that.
[115:21.87]It's at this point where we just start taking bets.
[115:23.77]Are they going to cap it, ever?
[115:26.39]Are they just gonna not be able to do this?
[115:28.10]They have 4 minutes and 25 seconds to cap it.
[115:30.46]I don't know.
[115:31.18]If they can kill Robin, if they can actually, like, keep him dead... Yeah, but then he can do his thing where he makes him all...
[115:38.73]You're going to have to go to his house and pin his arms down or something.
[115:42.77]You're going to steal his keyboard.
[115:44.36]If he wasn't at a constant 300 health too, because of the medic, I believe in Pao, but he's going to have to charge up that shot and get so hacky.
[115:54.79]If Pao pulls it off, I mean, that'll just be amazing.
[115:58.22]There he goes.
[115:59.16]There's also a sentry gun, which is just kind of the icing on the cake.
[116:02.77]It's like, oh, you want to jump up here?
[116:03.95]You got by Robin?
[116:04.71]Oh, there's a level three.
[116:05.71]We have a little cap trying to happen here.
[116:07.52]Look at this guy.
[116:08.09]I wish I could spawn pumpkins to help.
[116:13.46]Not a bad idea.
[116:15.00]Yeah, they're gonna try to get in the point spy and demo, but hey, there's Robin.
[116:18.66]Oh, we're getting close to killing the pyro.
[116:21.65]How do you shoutcast this?
[116:23.33]You don't.
[116:23.71]You just let Robin take over.
[116:25.31]I think we just go right back to the war room.
[116:27.00]That's probably the best bet right now.
[116:29.10]What do you guys think?
[116:29.70]Do you want to hear Robin?
[116:30.84]Or do you want to hear more of Robin's victims?
[116:33.22]Let's get more quotes out of Robin.
[116:34.83]Yeah, let's go back to Robin and see what he's doing.
[116:40.33]Nice hit.
[116:43.97]Stop donking me.
[116:45.35]That was headshot.
[116:46.41]Where you guys, uh, pushing from?
[116:47.71]That was sitting there.
[116:48.47]Oh, man.
[116:48.75]Oh, my god.
[116:54.08]Oh, no.
[116:54.32]They're flanking.
[116:54.82]Oh, I got backstabbed.
[116:55.94]No!
[116:58.33]No pudding!
[116:59.63]Oh, god.
[117:00.03]This is bad.
[117:00.85]Oh, no.
[117:01.57]Robin.
[117:02.21]Our lord and savior.
[117:03.98]Robin, save me!
[117:05.80]Oh, Robin.
[117:08.24]Can't rocket jump with this.
[117:11.24]Oh, they are getting on point.
[117:13.22]I think.
[117:13.72]Maybe not.
[117:13.98]Show them cap eventually, I think.
[117:23.09]The best part was watching Robin try to rocket jump there.
[117:25.71]I can't rocket jump with this thing!
[117:27.50]This thing sucks!
[117:29.40]I think it'll be interesting to break down this match from the sizzling stats at the end.
[117:32.78]That's what I'm excited to see.
[117:34.51]I'm kind of confident Robin's stats will probably say zero damage just because it's too much damages.
[117:41.56]It's not real.
[117:42.22]It's a dream.
[117:43.69]So he should just make wings for himself so he can just fly around.
[117:46.77]He'd just be noclipping right now.
[117:48.90]Yeah, the donations keep coming in as well.
[117:50.36]I just saw $100 from Frilly.
[117:52.12]People are going crazy right now for Robin.
[117:53.68]Putting on a show for the people.
[117:54.79]So awesome.
[117:55.67]Thank you so much, guys.
[117:56.41]$100,000.
[117:56.99]It kind of glazed over because Robin's doing the Robin.
[118:02.69]The crate drops the do it online.
[118:04.12]Do it online.
[118:04.78]Got the donation from Valve Cheats for Kids.
[118:09.10]Love it.
[118:09.56]We're at $101,000.
[118:10.90]Almost to $102,000.
[118:12.06]Just amazing.
[118:13.16]$102,000 American dollars.
[118:15.45]That is out of this world.
[118:17.55]In two days.
[118:19.79]I want to know how much.
[118:20.59]I mean, we closed that last little bit from about $10,000 in like an hour.
[118:26.75]While Robin is putting on the show for the kids, I don't know.
[118:29.92]They heard, I think it was Pudding Cup say, well, I would just let him win.
[118:33.54]They kind of feel bad, but Robin has no remorse, man.
[118:36.17]He's just dropping the pain everywhere.
[118:37.77]He's got no mercy.
[118:39.03]Kuma's going hard up, trying to pull it off himself.
[118:44.26]Unfortunately, the rockets kill people in one shot anyway.
[118:47.74]Why do you need it to look like it has crits?
[118:50.17]Pau is trying to pick out a shot here.
[118:52.29]Oh, my God.
[118:52.81]Pau is trying to do it.
[118:55.20]I'll bring it home.
[118:56.26]Oh, Robin Walker, you might be in trouble here.
[118:59.01]He's going to have to jump up there.
[119:00.73]Well, he's just going to shoot a million rockets that are crits into the box of doom.
[119:05.42]And everyone's going to die.
[119:06.20]What a shot by Pau, by the way.
[119:07.26]You can hit that shot and you missed all those others.
[119:09.30]Yeah, Pau's ridiculous, by the way.
[119:12.94]And we have 40 seconds left, so I don't know, Ster.
[119:16.15]That's probably about as close as they could possibly get.
[119:18.07]I don't know.
[119:19.35]Everybody was dead.
[119:20.41]Robin was on the ground.
[119:23.36]Yeah.
[119:23.78]Crit rockets, pretty good.
[119:25.04]But God love blue for trying.
[119:27.02]Yeah, so chalk it up for a win for Jerma.
[119:29.65]Yeah, I mean, pretty... Nice job, Jerma.
[119:32.15]Well fought by both teams.
[119:33.35]No, they... Well, I mean, they have to push still.
[119:38.36]I think it's still anybody's game.
[119:39.96]Yeah, it's like that.
[119:42.75]I was doming people, and he's dead.
[119:47.38]He just runs at him too.
[119:49.30]It's like I think there's guys over there and he holds down left click and pyros.
[119:52.91]It's a WM1 soldier.
[119:55.60]I love that he has to reload too.
[119:57.24]Like when he stops shooting you see the auto reload kick in.
[120:00.21]Pretty strong.
[120:01.69]You don't have to load anything.
[120:03.21]Alright, so Rob Walker and company.
[120:06.71]Five doms.
[120:07.37]Who is he not doming?
[120:08.84]Probably Smaka, right?
[120:09.70]Because Smaka killed him that one time.
[120:12.12]That's right.
[120:12.40]Smaka sawed through his bones.
[120:14.90]We all saw that.
[120:15.58]I don't think we can get the stats from Source TV, ladies and gentlemen.
[120:20.29]We have numerous people.
[120:21.65]But we can get them on stream.
[120:24.45]Oh, I don't have them.
[120:29.12]Let's get those Sizzlers.
[120:31.41]Just so we can analyze what happened in that half.
[120:37.70]Really not that much.
[120:39.66]I'm waiting for these stats.
[120:47.15]I'm looking at the stream like, please, I need to know.
[120:49.72]A little bit delayed there for us.
[120:51.06]We're actually finally able to see him show up on the stream.
[120:53.49]31 and 4.
[120:56.53]that four times so I guess we we want her we could be with we got the uh... a hundred thousand dollar goal I have to get around so I think I could be at the magic kicked in there's only one death and with a katie of eight uh... probably looking to improve on that in this room if you can't become the uh... fully buff fully jacks you must fire creatures you must like those ideas of they can actually school cap while there are invisible like this
[121:23.32]that's that's not that's not that's that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that's not that
[121:42.96]They're not invulnerable anymore.
[121:44.54]The NG's certainly taking damage.
[121:46.96]Kuma's gonna get the kill on him.
[121:48.27]Bonesaws are coming out.
[121:49.09]Robin Walker is dead, so I don't know what killed him.
[121:51.23]Who killed him?
[121:51.77]Oh, Grape got him.
[121:53.62]Grape is good enough to get him there.
[121:56.50]Just the best.
[121:58.20]I'm surprised Robin doesn't have immediate respawn.
[122:01.64]He needs to fix that.
[122:03.08]Well, let's see if he's going so fast.
[122:04.82]Let's see if POW is going to be able to headshot him.
[122:06.05]If anyone in the world can, it's POW.
[122:07.45]Here he goes, Robin Walker with his machine gun rocket launcher.
[122:10.27]Akuma's waiting.
[122:11.51]Akuma wants to stab on him, too.
[122:14.20]Look at Robin Walker doing the me as a heavy strat.
[122:17.64]Rockets everywhere.
[122:18.74]Akuma wants him.
[122:20.17]Akuma wants him.
[122:21.33]The medic sees him, probably calling it out.
[122:24.83]Robin shooting everything that moves.
[122:27.42]I'll let me go back playing one more time to be defensive team team is getting destroyed they still have to get a I'm there but no effort I'll it's right they know you because they kept they kept being I'll yeah here too hard yes I said so the screen so let's go listen in on the red team together and defend a no I'm gonna kill Robin Walker I'll here
[122:58.14]I got the medic.
[122:59.98]Contest point.
[123:02.66]Robin, you're mine.
[123:04.39]We need help today.
[123:06.85]Got it.
[123:07.25]On the way.
[123:08.11]Reinforcements coming in.
[123:09.03]Oh boy, that's a soldier.
[123:10.00]Sniper.
[123:10.94]Left, left, left.
[123:11.70]I need it.
[123:12.46]I don't know.
[123:13.56]Just leave him alone there.
[123:17.33]He's coming up behind you.
[123:18.53]He's gonna come up behind you.
[123:21.58]Who is?
[123:22.80]Ravi.
[123:23.44]There was a soldier running around with a pan on a million dollar banner.
[123:27.70]I see... I see him!
[123:28.22]I see him!
[123:28.57]I see him!
[123:29.95]Don't peek!
[123:30.59]Don't peek!
[123:31.25]Oh, Med's double doxxed.
[123:33.47]Damn.
[123:33.59]What's going on?
[123:35.71]Where's our Med?
[123:36.42]He's mine.
[123:37.38]I thought that was him.
[123:40.28]Oh my god!
[123:42.02]Oh my god!
[123:45.69]They want it so bad!
[123:47.33]Ravi Walker directs tower at the end.
[123:49.71]The air is shot.
[123:52.09]Akuma actually does kill me.
[123:53.49]He's ridiculously good, but that air shot or that direct rocket.
[123:58.14]When I attempt to jump in, Sezko immediately, I'm going to kill Robin Walker.
[124:01.95]By the way, I thought that was Jerma saying it.
[124:03.83]I was like, what, are you going to get in there, Jerma?
[124:05.67]No, see, I thought the best part of that was when Robin was shooting his own team's teleporter.
[124:10.32]Right, with the pan.
[124:12.29]That's how you do it.
[124:13.79]He's just making sure it was built.
[124:14.93]He probably built some of that panzer.
[124:17.11]I'm so glad Akuma got him.
[124:18.25]Is that twice now?
[124:19.79]I don't think he got him the other time when he was full cheating.
[124:22.58]The spy has the chance.
[124:25.54]I'm just really upset that my team doesn't have a Pyro.
[124:28.98]I feel like some Reflex would be pretty useful.
[124:31.10]Yeah, I was thinking that too.
[124:32.45]I don't know.
[124:33.85]I wonder how many of those he could Reflex.
[124:35.43]They've still stayed honorable to their classes.
[124:39.07]They are very noble to the end.
[124:42.28]So they think Capsi at any point, Robin's going to win.
[124:45.00]I think that might happen, although Robin is now playing heavy.
[124:48.25]Uh-oh.
[124:50.29]And his heavy, I gotta say, loadout looks pretty badass.
[124:52.81]Cheating.
[124:53.23]You can't switch classes.
[124:54.75]He's cheated a little bit too much now.
[124:56.75]Star has had enough.
[124:57.46]Nope, that's it.
[124:58.30]Disqualified.
[124:58.86]Those are the official rules.
[124:59.84]We never said anything about Valve weapons.
[125:02.16]We're changing classes.
[125:03.50]Come on.
[125:04.42]Something ominous is gonna happen, it looks like here.
[125:06.79]I'm not sure, but Robin Walker is hanging out.
[125:09.41]He's just standing completely still.
[125:11.09]It's like the Hulk.
[125:12.05]He's just waiting.
[125:13.89]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[125:14.29]Let's go to the mumble and see what the heck Robin's planning or if he's just, like, dancing a phone call.
[125:26.97]What is tip of the head?
[125:28.62]Well... We did go alive, there's nothing being said, I believe, right?
[125:33.89]Uh, he's... Moved.
[125:36.65]Oh, okay, here we go.
[125:37.51]Alright, he's going ham now.
[125:39.32]Want me to go back?
[125:40.00]Uh, well, he's going ham, Lang.
[125:41.90]We have to go back.
[125:42.94]Is the round actually over then?
[125:45.59]No, no, it's stopwatch.
[125:46.69]No, we have to cap C. We have seven minutes to cap C.
[125:49.87]Scout took 70.
[125:51.08]Oh, right, okay.
[125:51.86]Wait, so we are actually still playing?
[125:53.16]Yeah, we're still playing.
[125:54.37]Come on, Max.
[125:55.01]Yeah, you just gotta get C, I think, right?
[125:56.50]I broke up the hand.
[125:57.58]All we have to do is get C, that's it.
[126:03.79]Okay.
[126:04.90]Okay, I don't know if he's playing this legit right now.
[126:07.70]They're using their minds to communicate right now, is I think what it is.
[126:10.98]I thought maybe, like, just legit, like, bad intentions would come out of his minigun when he spun it up.
[126:15.49]It looks like just regular bullets, I don't know.
[126:17.47]He thinks he's just gonna walk in there with the ham?
[126:20.20]I swear they're coming, this is the most awkward timing I've seen.
[126:24.54]After all, like, the crit rockets, he's like, you know, I'm gonna, like, ham somebody.
[126:28.29]I don't know, maybe...
[126:30.15]He's gonna go ham.
[126:30.91]I don't know.
[126:31.42]Oh, Fragile's dead.
[126:32.24]Akuma everywhere.
[126:33.44]And Robin's gonna... die?
[126:35.80]Die.
[126:37.28]He's just playing heavy.
[126:39.33]It's like, I've taken you this far, team.
[126:40.55]My cheats have ran out.
[126:41.83]Fragile doesn't get it either.
[126:43.13]Like, everyone is so confused right now.
[126:45.08]Like, is this just a normal game all of a sudden?
[126:47.64]This is how you play Gravel Pit.
[126:49.48]You do the stopwatch thing.
[126:50.83]I think most of these guys are familiar with that.
[126:54.37]Yeah, I don't know.
[126:55.53]Fragile's gonna get a million uber from killing Akuma.
[126:58.81]We'll see!
[127:00.21]I don't know, I'm very confused.
[127:01.77]Robin Walker is now playing Demo.
[127:03.95]He's a Demoknight.
[127:05.78]Swinging that batted sword.
[127:07.20]And it looks like his pipe launcher is pretty regular.
[127:10.58]It's just normal.
[127:11.32]It's just a boring pipe launcher.
[127:13.26]Okay.
[127:13.87]What's up with that?
[127:15.03]Wow, you're nobody special now.
[127:17.49]Heh!
[127:18.97]Uh-oh.
[127:19.33]Trouble for Robin now.
[127:20.43]He's bleeding!
[127:21.27]He's got the sword!
[127:22.60]Hey!
[127:23.62]Take a seat, Greg.
[127:24.68]Robin died doing what he loved, playing Demoknight.
[127:28.02]Yes!
[127:28.56]That's all he wanted to do was die on Demoknight.
[127:32.49]Yes!
[127:34.99]You know, I think he's trying to keep his streak alive by losing every game he cheats in.
[127:38.03]That might be true as well.
[127:42.90]But they're good, I mean, you know, they still have good players, they can still get in there.
[127:45.92]They are using ridiculous weapons, like YouMustMike is using the Shortstop, which is pretty funny.
[127:51.96]I think you cheat at the end.
[127:52.93]You don't cheat in the middle and then play for real.
[127:55.47]That's how you lose.
[127:56.45]We'll see how many headshots it takes for him to get really mad and turn the cheats back on.
[128:00.54]Although Robin Walker's the same kind of guy as in a rage of Paua.
[128:03.42]Somehow.
[128:05.91]Akuma's sneak... Akuma spotted out.
[128:08.41]Paua still wants him.
[128:09.17]I mean, Paua's dying, I think.
[128:11.58]He's dying to pick him out.
[128:17.17]Pala is so gonna get backbanned after this.
[128:21.46]Yeah, maybe.
[128:22.92]Max is getting dominated by Pala, so it's interesting.
[128:25.59]Pala definitely has easier time, less pressure put on his team to snipe.
[128:30.08]Pala with his 168 ping, of course.
[128:32.10]Kill there by Robin Walker.
[128:33.84]Got legitimately his head chopped off, so see you later.
[128:38.88]And UMass Mike gets one.
[128:39.70]And they have Uber.
[128:40.42]They're going to push in.
[128:41.08]Akuma is alive, so it's really only three combat classes.
[128:43.81]Akuma's just trying to ambassador.
[128:45.71]If they ever had a chance to win this right now, it would be right now.
[128:48.52]They're going to pop the old Pyro Uber in.
[128:51.33]Classic strategy.
[128:52.73]And there goes Mr. Pudding Cup.
[128:54.33]He's gonna right click on top of this thing.
[128:55.77]I actually think they're just gonna win now.
[128:57.72]Here comes the jump.
[128:58.64]Will they be able to stop it?
[128:59.62]The demo is on the back of that roof.
[129:01.00]Here comes a soldier.
[129:01.90]Does make the jump, but it's not gonna matter.
[129:03.08]They're gonna win.
[129:03.74]The spy is on the point who didn't even decloak to stop it.
[129:09.27]Akuma.
[129:09.89]Akuma going huge.
[129:11.65]So wait a minute.
[129:12.87]Rob Walker broke the streak.
[129:15.10]He won and cheated, but didn't cheat to win.
[129:18.54]Hey, that's awesome.
[129:20.62]Guys, I'm just happy I was here to see that number tick across 100,000.
[129:24.27]Thank you so much.
[129:25.01]It's been excellent.
[129:26.17]You guys rock.
[129:27.58]Thanks, Sal.
[129:28.16]Love you, Sal.
[129:30.62]Yeah, we're at 102,420.
[129:33.43]Something never changed.
[129:35.21]Sizer's pointing out that you must make out-damaged Robin, which is astounding.
[129:43.19]That's amazing to me.
[129:44.89]Don't go anywhere, guys.
[129:45.81]What we're going to do now is go back into one last pub session.
[129:48.56]Sean, do you know what the time frame is going to be on announcing winners?
[129:52.26]Yes, we're working on it.
[129:53.34]We're going to announce them really, really quickly.
[129:56.15]I believe the Robin Walker auction is still going in the time draft, and we'll pull those two winners last.
[130:02.19]But everything else we will announce as soon as we have the list.
[130:06.48]Yes, we're going to head over to the pub.
[130:08.02]I'll get Robin over in there.
[130:11.26]So you will all get your chance to kill Robin Walker.
[130:26.98]Oh, come on!
[130:28.44]Alright, getaway-o!
[130:30.52]How you doing?
[130:31.48]Alright, we got regular- Oh, here we go.
[130:33.25]Joining us.
[130:35.93]Robin Walker, we got $102,000.
[130:38.23]You kept your word, busted out the cheats.
[130:40.43]But then, you just pulled them back and let the team legitly win.
[130:43.88]Yeah, what's that strategy?
[130:45.14]Pulling out the cheats and then turning them off?
[130:47.44]I like it!
[130:47.82]I think that's good.
[130:48.50]That's good sportmanship.
[130:50.63]Just gotta hold them in reserve.
[130:52.17]And I know you're disappointed you didn't get a chance to dominate Sizer.
[130:56.46]I think you had the whole team but the Medic dominated during the course of the game, but that's alright.
[131:00.24]Someday you'll get Sizer.
[131:02.63]Robin, I sent you the
