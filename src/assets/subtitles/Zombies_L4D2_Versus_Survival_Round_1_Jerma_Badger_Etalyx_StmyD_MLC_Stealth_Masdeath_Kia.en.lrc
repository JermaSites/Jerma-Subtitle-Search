[00:01.58]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.69]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:24.76]Dude, dude, no, no, I've gotten to like 107, and you think it's a little green and black, but it still runs.
[00:31.96]Why do you have to manually turn that on?
[00:34.56]Dude, it's a funky situation, and the 5970 is like a gigantic, it's like the Dreamliner.
[00:40.42]It's so scary.
[00:41.14]It's so scary.
[00:42.30]Alright, so what is going on here?
[00:44.54]I've never played here before.
[00:45.61]Wait, what's happening?
[00:47.21]I'm extremely confused.
[00:48.45]Hold on, you can't attack me right now.
[00:50.21]I am fixing my mouse.
[00:52.67]You have 70 seconds until spawning starts, apparently.
[00:56.08]Wait, what?
[00:56.90]How does this game work?
[00:57.46]There's a little counter on the left-hand side of the screen.
[00:59.46]I don't know.
[00:59.72]This is the new mutation.
[01:01.06]It's called Versus Survival.
[01:02.36]It's just Survival, except...
[01:04.04]Oh, man.
[01:04.96]Am I supposed to be as confused as I am right now?
[01:07.58]Alright, hold on.
[01:08.48]Alright, zombies.
[01:09.32]Let's, like, get together here.
[01:10.37]Alright, well, one team is people and one team is zombies.
[01:14.55]It's just the regular survival.
[01:15.77]What class am I?
[01:16.47]Okay.
[01:17.11]Oh, this is crazy.
[01:17.79]Alright.
[01:18.47]We have to kill you by law, you're a shell.
[01:20.25]Alright, Alex, let me work with you.
[01:22.51]I'm up here just chilling.
[01:24.59]Wait, are we trying to progress?
[01:25.87]What does calling in the ferry do?
[01:27.03]You just survive for as long as possible.
[01:30.05]That's what survival is.
[01:31.23]Yeah, but how come we can call the ferry?
[01:32.39]That's weird.
[01:33.69]Maybe that's what starts it if you're all ready.
[01:35.54]Yeah, don't try that right now, bro.
[01:39.94]Maybe you should pull that lever.
[01:41.30]Oh, it's on now.
[01:42.46]Alright, get Badger.
[01:43.78]Is that thing even coming over?
[01:46.09]I don't think that's coming over.
[01:48.09]Give it to me, Badger.
[01:49.41]You know you love it.
[01:50.29]Alright, zombies attack.
[01:54.68]Oh god.
[01:55.56]He's got double team.
[01:56.48]Oh, Badger, this is like survival, but with versus.
[02:02.16]Dude, I'm humping someone.
[02:03.92]I don't know.
[02:04.90]I can't even get to you.
[02:07.12]What now, Jerma?
[02:08.74]Oh, nice mask.
[02:09.44]Good job.
[02:10.43]We lasted 40 seconds.
[02:12.19]No, I'm right.
[02:12.81]I'm coming.
[02:13.21]I'm coming.
[02:14.35]Dude, I'm still humping this guy.
[02:15.73]It feels so good.
[02:18.25]Shoot down the stairs.
[02:21.51]Oh, I'm a tank, what's up?
[02:23.71]Uh-oh.
[02:25.19]I don't know how to do this.
[02:27.71]Uh, you run and punch stuff.
[02:30.15]Yeah, don't throw rocks, just punch.
[02:33.02]Throw as many rocks as you can.
[02:34.62]I'm going to look for a Molotov.
[02:36.50]No, you seriously need a Molotov, dude.
[02:38.42]Whoa, whoa.
[02:39.30]Get him, Mass.
[02:40.86]Go for the end cap.
[02:43.08]I'm on fire.
[02:44.14]No, run.
[02:45.31]Oh, my God.
[02:48.87]I'm burning.
[02:49.37]I don't like it.
[02:51.15]Get him, Mask, get him.
[02:53.97]Cover me, Badger.
[02:54.83]Cover me, Badger.
[02:55.51]Dude, I'm so stuck.
[02:56.65]Smack him in the water.
[02:59.09]Bitter.
[03:00.01]Oh, he's done.
[03:01.55]I'm so stuck.
[03:02.67]Get him, Zomp.
[03:03.41]Get him, Kia.
[03:04.59]Get him.
[03:05.41]Oh, God.
[03:06.61]Kia, pounce on someone, son.
[03:08.41]No, Jeremy, no.
[03:09.47]He missed.
[03:10.25]He missed.
[03:11.05]He missed.
[03:11.83]I can't believe I just missed.
[03:14.17]That was my plan the entire time, was to miss everyone.
[03:17.91]Oh, God.
[03:19.77]Come on, zombies.
[03:22.38]We gotta kill him.
[03:23.60]I just took a big chunk of your black booty, Jerma.
[03:28.78]Hey, the fairy's here.
[03:32.00]Don't try to jump to it.
[03:32.92]You won't make it.
[03:33.98]If you try to jump to it, you have a better chance of making it.
[03:36.19]Why don't we get up high again?
[03:37.65]Didn't you know all the survivors are great swimmers?
[03:39.91]There's a bunch of stuff in here.
[03:45.03]Come on tank, let's go.
[03:47.09]Oh god, oh god!
[03:48.23]It's worth the food in there.
[03:49.34]I've got some peels and some... I'm dead.
[03:50.98]I'm so dead.
[03:51.92]Alright, you're done.
[03:53.44]Alright, Jocko, let's go.
[03:55.16]Let him go, Jerma.
[03:56.30]Oh god, tank!
[03:58.96]Jerma, come back!
[03:59.96]I'm already in cap.
[04:03.18]He's out here with us!
[04:04.30]How'd he get out here?
[04:06.21]Man, you guys are dumb.
[04:07.85]I need a shotgun.
[04:09.61]The zombies attack, like I got these fools.
[04:11.95]Alright Jerma, is this GG?
[04:13.25]Yeah, this is GG.
[04:14.41]Hey Jerma, you're so pretty.
[04:15.29]There we go, alright.
[04:16.51]2 for 5.
[04:32.22]I blame Jerma for trying to go saving that dude.
[04:35.34]We could have gotten on the boat.
[04:36.60]Never leave a man behind.
[04:38.08]We had a day's worth of food.
[04:42.85]You guys could have gone off.
[04:44.11]I would have picked up Badger.
[04:45.39]We would have held the frontal plotline of every major American classic.
[04:50.19]Rochelle was supposed to die first and she didn't.
[04:52.13]That's a real major plot flaw.
[04:57.34]Let's go search for Molotovs and stuff.
[05:00.02]No, you can't do that.
[05:01.06]Yeah, we can.
[05:01.56]We got, like, 60 seconds.
[05:02.42]No, dude, just hit the alarm.
[05:05.12]No, don't do it.
[05:05.80]Good idea.
[05:06.74]That's what I did.
[05:07.84]It was a lot of fun.
[05:08.78]Alright, I'll set up some gas cans.
[05:10.96]That'll be smart.
[05:11.80]The sooner you hit the alarm, the more points you get.
[05:13.70]Oh, really?
[05:14.12]Hey, hey, Stim, Stim, I like your tongue, bro.
[05:16.88]I'm, like, 80% sure that's true.
[05:18.66]Yeah.
[05:19.13]It's steamy, you retard.
[05:22.06]It's steamy D. Oh Good steamy D bro.
[05:27.35]It's steamy dick.
[05:29.49]Oh What?
[05:31.75]That's not what I was referring to.
[05:32.91]Yeah, totally different.
[05:34.41]No, it's not We got 30 seconds.
[05:37.14]Alright, we got this ish.
[05:38.88]Does anyone have a Molotov yet?
[05:40.20]I don't.
[05:40.54]We have two.
[05:41.20]I picked one up.
[05:41.84]Okay.
[05:43.88]Shiba, you're not even hip to the lingo yet.
[05:46.10]I believe the term is molly if you're cool and pro.
[05:49.79]If you're pro.
[05:50.55]We got to spread these cans out a little better.
[05:52.39]It's true.
[05:52.75]The less syllables you say, the better of a person you are.
[05:55.17]Dude, just call it an M. Just like ecstasy is condensed to E. Moab.
[05:59.27]We're going to start sounding like cavemen soon enough.
[06:03.46]My ADD is kicking in.
[06:04.56]Let's do this thing.
[06:05.52]Alright, do it.
[06:07.92]Alright, start it up.
[06:09.06]We got gas cans everywhere.
[06:10.72]Let's do it.
[06:12.55]Can't stand still for more than one minute.
[06:14.27]Okay.
[06:15.21]Don't shoot the cans yet.
[06:16.13]We got a charger coming.
[06:17.65]Yeah.
[06:18.01]Be careful with the cans.
[06:19.09]Oh, come on.
[06:19.77]Nice.
[06:20.73]Oh, spit.
[06:21.51]Spit.
[06:22.05]Yep.
[06:23.19]Yes!
[06:23.69]I got seven points for that spit.
[06:25.49]Snipe you with my tongue.
[06:28.65]Woot.
[06:30.16]Alright, so far so good, so far so good.
[06:31.84]Hey, StymieD, hit up a wombo combo, alright?
[06:34.00]Alright, here we go, wombo combo.
[06:36.26]Everyone says it differently, it's funny.
[06:37.62]Oh my gosh, it takes like 20 seconds to spawn.
[06:40.07]Sounds like he's like a medical beast.
[06:42.63]Oh, sounds like a Call of Duty fanboy up in here.
[06:44.51]They know, they know, Stymie, they know, they know!
[06:47.89]Alright, I'm calling the fairy.
[06:50.18]Brett, you must hate Counter-Strike then if you don't like waiting to spawn.
[06:53.76]Our timer just started.
[06:55.60]Oh, what?
[06:56.08]Our timer just started?
[06:57.26]Who failed on that one?
[06:59.94]Wait, you guys are all dead?
[07:08.70]What the hell happened?
[07:11.04]What?
[07:12.02]Wow, worst team ever.
[07:14.30]I want a redo.
[07:20.79]I have three terrible teammates that just killed themselves.
[07:23.97]All dead?
[07:25.05]It was just bad luck, man.
[07:26.65]It was just bad luck.
[07:29.78]yo I called one wow yeah wow we got some I got some Call of Duty players up in here why did the timer start so late what was that all about you have to pull the lever for the fairy
[07:42.64]If you don't pull the lever, then the game just starts without you and you get no credit for the time.
[07:47.48]That was, that was retarded.
[07:50.06]I charged like 20 of you off into the water.
[07:53.11]So we were fighting for like 45 seconds before I'm like, ah, just pull the lever now.
[07:57.33]Oh, that's so funny.
[07:59.03]Alright, let's, let's randomize teams again.
[08:02.52]So everyone just go random and then choose another map, I guess.
