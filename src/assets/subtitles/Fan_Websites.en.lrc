[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.06]Oh, mega early.
[00:07.62]Very early.
[00:08.42]Mega early.
[00:10.20]Yeah, kind of.
[00:16.14]Hold on.
[00:18.54]What?
[00:21.81]I almost just said... Never mind.
[00:24.37]I was going to say start.
[00:28.05]I'm not going to say it.
[00:28.65]Then I'm going to say it five seconds.
[00:29.61]I'm not going to say it.
[00:30.19]Then I'm going to say it.
[00:31.09]Anyways.
[00:32.35]Whatever.
[00:32.63]Just pretend you knew what I was going to say.
[00:37.86]There's no music?
[00:39.64]Oh shit, hold on.
[00:41.49]I got, don't worry, I've got you covered.
[00:44.43]Here we go.
[00:44.67]Fuck yeah.
[00:45.11]Hello, yes, hi everybody.
[01:04.81]Today is going to be a very short stream.
[01:08.87]It'll be very quick and to the point.
[01:11.11]Well, not even really to the point.
[01:14.67]We got some things to do today.
[01:15.75]A couple of very interesting things that I find incredibly interesting.
[01:20.91]There are a couple of websites that I came across that have to do with this community.
[01:26.29]And I really, really want to do them.
[01:29.87]Because one of them is very relevant to like a week ago and the other one is just cool.
[01:36.09]So this is not the final stream.
[01:37.89]No, no, no.
[01:40.35]Oh, this is the, this is it.
[01:42.17]This is the last one.
[01:46.44]Hold on.
[01:46.82]These like cat ears are so itchy.
[01:49.44]God.
[01:49.80]I'm just kidding.
[01:53.04]There's no fucking cat ears.
[01:57.30]You see, look at the chat.
[01:58.25]The chat just went insane.
[01:59.75]The chat just went boom.
[02:02.87]No, I do not have a cat boy costume on right now.
[02:07.90]You say the words catboy and all of a sudden, oh my god, here come the floodgates of chat messages.
[02:15.78]Prove it.
[02:16.23]I'm gonna prove it.
[02:17.03]I'm gonna put the camera on.
[02:19.91]The first thing we're gonna do... So this stream is gonna be probably like an hour, maybe.
[02:25.91]Tops.
[02:26.75]It depends on how long it takes me to do the greatest video games of all time tier list.
[02:32.18]That could take like four hours.
[02:34.18]I don't know.
[02:40.61]That's fine.
[02:44.33]But we'll see.
[02:48.01]One hour Andy.
[02:51.99]No, there's no cat boy today.
[02:58.49]We're just going to hang out.
[03:01.51]Is everything okay?
[03:02.41]Everything is fine.
[03:03.49]No, no.
[03:04.11]Guys, the stream is not 45 minutes because, like, something is wrong.
[03:08.34]Guys, I only got, like, 45 minutes.
[03:10.94]And something is very wrong.
[03:14.34]And I'm... Please help me.
[03:17.66]Let's get a bunch of community subs.
[03:18.52]Thank you, Megadial, for the 20 community subs.
[03:22.46]Two zero.
[03:27.47]Thank you.
[03:27.73]That's a lot.
[03:31.97]The first thing I want to do is very relevant to what we did.
[03:34.17]Well, let's just go over here.
[03:35.17]You know what?
[03:35.55]Hey, hi.
[03:36.03]How are you?
[03:38.59]Hey.
[03:39.95]What's up?
[03:41.60]Oh, he's got the cat ears!
[03:43.02]No.
[03:44.64]I got the twitch.tv shirt on.
[03:46.82]How you doing?
[03:47.54]How's everybody doing?
[03:50.04]What a letdown.
[03:52.94]This is not a Catboy stream.
[03:55.23]I didn't make that clear that this was a Catboy stream.
[04:00.55]I look a little stuffed in here, though, don't I?
[04:04.37]Don't I kind of look like I don't fit in here?
[04:08.13]I feel like I'm wearing, like, a sleeping bag or something.
[04:10.10]Like... Oh, I'm here for the sleepover!
[04:15.66]Just put a pillow behind me.
[04:17.00]Okay.
[04:22.54]Is it extra small?
[04:24.98]Take it off and reveal the cat wear.
[04:26.74]No, this is not a scenario where like, oh, the reason why he looks like he's got a bunch of clothes on, he's going to unzip this and it's going to be a full Catboy maid outfit.
[04:35.05]What are they even in?
[04:35.95]Is it a maid outfit?
[04:36.69]Did I just say that?
[04:46.07]It is a maid outfit.
[04:47.06]It is?
[04:47.28]Okay.
[04:47.56]You wish.
[04:49.06]You wish.
[04:53.43]Anyways, first of all, I apologize in advance for the image that you're going to see on the screen, that you're going to get an image on the screen.
[04:58.86]And I'm very sorry, but it's relevant to what we talked about last week.
[05:05.04]And somebody, I'm going to give credit for credit.
[05:07.27]This is from the Jerma.
[05:09.75]It's from a, no, don't say anything.
[05:13.83]Jerma985 was on here, on this we- this is a place.
[05:18.32]I'm not saying- I don't want to say what this is.
[05:20.76]It's just a- it's a place that I found.
[05:22.46]It's a thing.
[05:23.38]I was about to just shout it out, and that was a fucking huge mistake, potentially.
[05:27.57]Okay.
[05:28.97]Uh, what you're gonna see on the screen here, I'm very sorry, but it's- I'm sorry.
[05:35.59]Do you remember, when I recorded those messages, your personal message?
[05:43.49]Free happy birthday or anniversary message from when the imposter is sus guy.
[05:50.87]There it is.
[05:52.43]Let's begin.
[05:52.97]Okay, so let's do, let's do birthday, alternative birthday message for.
[05:58.72]Oh, you can't see the drop down menu, but I have a huge drop down menu here.
[06:05.36]Who should we do?

[06:08.10]We'll do Jeremy first.
[06:10.32]Let's see.
[06:10.68]Can you hear it?
[06:12.98]It's a personal message from the when the imposter is sus guy.
[06:43.37]Alright, how about Emma?
[06:45.17]We'll do birthday message one for Emma.
[06:47.43]Hey, I want to wish a very special happy birthday to Emma.

[06:52.97]Happy birthday to you.
[06:54.51]Hey, your friends put me up to this.
[06:56.39]Look at the unsureness in my face.
[06:58.92]I look like I just don't want to be here.
[07:02.30]It really does look like a lot of cameos.
[07:06.18]When you see a cameo and the person you can tell this is like the 60th one they've done in a row.
[07:13.38]Just look at my face.
[07:15.02]Happy birthday to Emma.
[07:16.78]Heard you had a big day today.

[08:14.22]I heard the story.
[08:15.12]I heard how fun it was.
[08:16.48]The proposal was fantastic.

[08:20.61]Happy anniversary, guys.

[08:26.94]The proposal was fantastic.
[08:28.70]Why do I look like I'm in pain here?
[08:33.20]The proposal was fantastic.
[08:36.58]I think I blinked like a hundred times.
[08:39.94]That was just like... The proposal was fantastic.
[08:43.79]Why did I just blink like 15 times?
[08:46.97]You're going to do good things.
[08:48.31]You're going to do good things.
[08:49.29]Happy anniversary.
[08:51.77]Oh, blink twice and you're in trouble.
[08:56.33]Alright, how about... Jerry.

[09:13.90]How many names did I say?
[09:14.94]How about Otto?
[09:17.76]Otto and Becca.
[09:20.07]Otto and Becca.
[09:22.13]You know.
[09:22.53]Oh, that didn't like that.
[09:24.37]Otto and Becca.
[09:26.43]You know.
[09:35.64]You know.
[09:36.14]How about happy birthday to Otto?
[09:42.71]Yo, Jerma985 here.
[09:44.01]Just want to say, oh, did I, excuse me, is it somebody's birthday today?
[09:47.23]Oh, of course it is.
[09:48.47]Happy birthday.
[09:49.63]Otto, I'm so happy to see you on your birthday.
[09:53.13]Otto, I was told you're a big fan and I'm coming to you personally.
[09:57.27]I love this.
[09:57.75]Nobody paid me to do this except they did.
[10:00.29]So you just give this to all your friends on their birthdays and stuff.
[10:03.58]You don't even have to pay me anything.
[10:05.08]Like I'll never have a cameo.
[10:06.76]Honestly, I want to add to this.
[10:10.20]I want to do, like, congratulations on the new job.
[10:12.26]And I want to add, like, another fucking 500 names.
[10:16.06]Everything that you could get a cameo for, let me just do it for free.
[10:19.91]You understand?
[10:21.15]Let me just do it for free.
[10:24.85]I will sit here and record, just off stream, like, another thousand names.
[10:29.97]And, like, ten different recordings.
[10:32.70]And just use mine for free.
[10:34.84]Don't pay for it.
[10:35.56]I'm pretty famous.
[10:38.64]Come on.
[10:40.61]There's 9,500 people here.
[10:42.69]I think... Come on.
[10:45.35]It's free.
[10:48.67]Alright, how about Otto and... How about... Okay, how about... How about Happy Birthday Miranda?
[10:55.29]Yo, Jerma985 here.
[10:56.59]Just want to say... Oh, did I... Excuse me.
[10:58.37]Is it somebody's birthday today?
[10:59.81]Oh, of course it is.
[11:01.05]Happy Birthday, Miranda.
[11:03.53]I'm so... Alright, one more anniversary.
[11:08.82]How about, uh, how about Mark and Mark?
[11:17.55]Mark and Mark.
[11:19.49]I think I broke the anniversary one.
[11:21.21]How about Keith and Julie?
[11:27.23]Keith and Julie.
[11:29.19]You know, I heard it was somebody's anniversary.
[11:33.33]Happy anniversary, you two.
[11:35.02]I heard the story.
[11:36.78]The best part about, I heard the story, they say that for every single one of them.
[11:42.90]So, people usually write a whole paragraph to the person doing the cameo, like, oh, this is how they met.
[11:48.45]And they read that, and they've probably already forgotten, so they just say, you know, I heard the story.
[11:55.53]What happened in the story?
[11:57.49]What happened in the story?
[11:59.62]Can you name one verb that was in that description?
[12:04.12]Or one noun?
[12:06.76]You can't, probably.
[12:07.64]And, come on, I'm doing them for free.
[12:12.18]I heard how fun it was.
[12:13.12]I love this.
[12:17.15]Alright, how about, I want to do one more birthday.
[12:23.01]Oh, this is a good birthday.
[12:24.45]Happy birthday, Thanos.
[12:27.32]Yo, Jerma985 here, just want to say, oh, did I, excuse me, is it somebody's birthday today?
[12:31.84]Oh, of course it is.
[12:33.08]Happy birthday.
[12:34.02]Thanos.
[12:35.56]I'm so happy to see you on your birthday.
[12:37.60]Thanos.
[12:38.84]I was told you're a big fan.
[12:42.30]Just like, somebody, okay, somebody said that in the chat, and I looked over and just read it.
[12:46.80]95 here, just want to say, oh, did I, excuse me, is it somebody's birthday today?
[12:51.09]Oh, of course it is.
[12:52.33]Happy birthday.
[12:53.25]Thanos.
[12:54.80]I'm so happy to see you on your birthday.
[12:56.84]Thanos.
[12:58.48]Well, there you go.
[12:59.26]You can use this.
[12:59.92]Eventually, I'll give you the link before you break it.
[13:03.90]So there it is.
[13:04.74]I'm surprised it was made this quickly.
[13:06.97]Michael.
[13:07.41]Okay, okay.
[13:07.89]Alright, alright, alright.
[13:08.59]I'll do Michael.
[13:13.51]Why is Goku on here?
[13:16.07]Why is Goku on here?
[13:17.51]Alright, Michael.
[13:22.61]I didn't even do Michael.
[13:26.35]I didn't do Michael, I did Mike.
[13:31.15]I can't believe I didn't do Michael.
[13:32.71]That's actually pretty bizarre.
[13:33.47]Close enough.
[13:33.75]Do it right now.
[13:34.09]Oh shit, alright, fine.
[13:59.27]Michael.
[14:04.41]Carl.
[14:08.12]Xander.
[14:11.66]Alan.
[14:13.42]Lucas.
[14:14.58]Scott.
[14:17.62]Ready for this one?
[14:18.92]Whoever has this name is going to be real fucking surprised because they're going to go through and they're going to do a few of them that aren't theirs.
[14:24.56]And this one, holy shit.
[14:27.84]You ready?
[14:29.63]Rachel.
[14:33.51]Ethan.
[14:35.53]Blake.
[14:39.95]Zach.
[14:45.81]Sydney.
[14:48.39]Justin.
[14:52.90]Tyler.
[14:55.12]Gabriel.
[14:59.33]Terry.
[15:02.65]Florence.
[15:07.28]What?
[15:08.72]Melissa.
[15:12.30]Ariana.
[15:14.60]Corey.
[15:17.36]Kevin!
[15:17.86]I was trying to do the home alone thing.
[15:26.33]When she's in the plane...
[15:29.81]Taylor!
[15:31.31]Alright, we're not doing this again.
[15:32.49]But we are going to do something else.
[15:40.01]Wait.
[15:41.05]Chucky!
[15:42.97]Just crop me.
[15:43.97]It's alright.
[15:45.82]Chucky is going to be super blown out.
[15:48.18]Chucky is going to be like 160p.
[15:53.44]The next thing we're going to do.
[15:54.52]Now this one is going to be a ton of fun.
[15:57.62]Are you ready for this one?
[15:59.94]This is called Jerma's chat real or AI generated.
[16:06.82]This device, this thing has been trained on this chat.
[16:13.67]It has pulled thousands and thousands of messages.
[16:17.33]And it is for me to determine if this is something that was actually written in the chat or the AI robot came up with this learning what you guys have said over the years.
[16:30.93]Let's find out.
[16:32.79]So we have to see how many of these we can get in a row.
[16:37.22]Oh, what?
[16:40.70]What kind of a name is that?
[16:44.34]That seems pretty AI generated, but I feel like that could be real.
[16:48.25]Real.
[16:49.21]That's incorrect.
[16:50.91]Try again.
[16:51.41]Zero streak.
[16:53.73]I don't think this is how it works.
[16:55.17]That's AI.
[16:56.17]Yeah, come on.
[16:58.16]This is like that one episode of SpongeBob where he's trying to get the seal.
[17:02.90]That's real.
[17:04.14]What?
[17:06.36]Only one.
[17:06.82]Alright, alright, alright.
[17:07.68]You get it.
[17:07.92]You get how it works.
[17:10.24]Too bad none of it's going to be in the actual game, real.
[17:14.44]You got a misspelling there.
[17:15.40]Robots don't misspell.
[17:16.34]They're fucking intelligent.
[17:17.96]Well, not to say that they're not intelligent, right?
[17:20.34]I'm going to rent out the Level Up Lounge in the MGM Casino to host my own convention.
[17:27.36]is that Jerma985 2009 that's ai generated sorry I didn't do that this game is so hard to watch that's real this is the last time you can play this game I think that's probably real what the shortness of his arm sleever is making me uncomfortable
[17:58.65]Sleever.
[17:59.95]That's AI.
[18:05.73]He's actually not going to say it.
[18:09.71]AI.
[18:10.75]What?
[18:13.01]You're not a clown, you're the entire circus.
[18:21.83]Imagine having a girlfriend when you have Twitch chat.
[18:25.09]I feel like that's AI.
[18:30.58]We're talking about how we can seduce you.
[18:32.64]That's real.
[18:34.54]This is like, yeah, you guys have gotten, your like fucking lewd levels have gone up like 600,000% in the last year.
[18:43.14]I don't think Jerma has the actual setup.
[18:49.43]That sounds AI.
[18:51.37]It is.
[18:52.77]Lemur's suicide tower for when they realize their enclosure sucks.
[19:04.17]Jerma, the only way to win is to... I thought that could have been AI.
[19:08.09]Jerma, the only way to win is to not play.
[19:10.09]That's AI.
[19:11.92]We're four in a row here.
[19:12.98]I gotta get to at least ten in a row.
[19:16.36]Jerma, I've been watching your videos for like two years.
[19:18.66]Please just stop.
[19:24.98]I think this one could be AI, but I think it's real because people tell me to stop streaming and stop doing YouTube and stuff all the time.
[19:37.85]Again, let's do it again.
[19:40.28]Oh, you're gonna get addicted to the game.
[19:42.04]You're gonna get addicted to the game in like 30 minutes, real.
[19:47.16]Hey, I know it's not that big of a deal, but I have to admit I'm really bummed that you're not playing this right now.
[19:51.43]That's AI, it has to be.
[19:53.37]That's a jumbled AI, it has to be AI.
[19:55.67]If it's real, I don't know what they're even talking about.
[19:57.41]Okay.
[19:58.95]Hey Stark, can I go to your house and talk to Lucy?
[20:01.32]This is fucking AI.
[20:10.30]What's the context behind that one?
[20:12.78]Hey Star, gonna go to your house and talk to Lucy.
[20:19.21]It ain't the size of the screw, it's how hard you drill.
[20:21.23]That's real.
[20:21.77]I think I wrote that.
[20:24.80]If you don't use the I'm the giant rat voice, you're not a hero.
[20:36.77]That seemed pretty real.
[20:40.75]Are you going to do the cooking stream?
[20:42.49]Real.
[20:43.57]Oh my god.
[20:44.97]You know the guy from the hit movie, The Phantom Pain?
[20:49.73]I feel like the ones that are very obviously AI end up being real.
[20:57.17]Wait, that's... You're doing a great job.
[21:00.41]Thanks for the stream.
[21:01.89]Now I know that's AI.
[21:03.93]I know that's AI.
[21:05.39]Motherfuckers don't write that here.
[21:08.25]How many people... I'm just kidding.
[21:10.07]But how many people die when they get a jetpack?
[21:17.05]But how many people die when they get a jetpack?
[21:19.17]I think that's real.
[21:20.85]It has the at Jerma985 on it.
[21:24.58]What did it say?
[21:25.98]What did it say?
[21:27.54]It's a jackpot.
[21:28.86]I almost pressed AI because I thought it said jetpack.
[21:34.07]Did he fight Giraffe?
[21:35.65]Seems like I missed a section of stream.
[21:37.65]And I don't know if he's optional.
[21:47.34]The thing is, like, people give weird, random, easy names to, like, the Dark Souls bosses.
[21:53.94]I'm trying to think.
[21:54.36]Oh, did he get to Dancer yet?
[21:56.66]But that's, like, short for something.
[22:00.55]Just put Giraffe...
[22:03.78]Did he get to banana yet?
[22:07.02]Did he get to schnoz yet?
[22:07.92]People say that kind of shit.
[22:08.80]It's... Real.
[22:12.42]Got it.
[22:14.57]Oh, God.
[22:14.97]At Jerma985, you just woke me the fuck up.
[22:16.81]That's real.
[22:19.53]Jerma, are you going to play the DS sequel after this?
[22:25.29]I don't buy this one.
[22:27.19]Am I going to play the DS sequel?
[22:30.97]Oh, Chibi-Robo.
[22:32.05]That's right.
[22:32.45]We're five in a row.
[22:34.62]Jerma's going to be in a clown car.
[22:46.84]What?
[22:48.20]How have none of you actually said that?
[22:50.10]What are you talking about?
[22:54.15]No one's actually writ that before?
[22:59.57]I love Jerma's stream, but not the chat reel.
[23:02.73]It's a game about, well, I'm just saying, like, I'm not, I don't believe that.
[23:06.17]I don't believe that.
[23:06.77]I'm just saying that's probably real.
[23:08.29]It's a game about collecting and selling coins, AI.
[23:12.11]Can you tell me what the fuck is happening, real?
[23:14.63]Well, whatever.
[23:16.77]The joke is that the bans don't happen.
[23:20.21]Real.
[23:21.70]Plumbers don't wear ties.
[23:22.90]Robots don't use guns.
[23:24.66]That's AI.
[23:41.18]Well, I'm sorry AI, but I have never streamed the movie Zoolander.
[23:47.84]And if I was streaming Zoolander on Twitch, I don't think you'd be asleep.
[23:51.52]You'd be waiting for me to get terminated.
[23:54.14]To laugh at OmegaLol when you see that streamer's been banned.
[24:08.48]Somebody wrote that.
[24:11.02]Okay.
[24:13.62]I guess somebody wrote that.
[24:15.21]I have no idea what that is, but I'm glad it's not a meme.
[24:19.29]Real.
[24:20.03]I don't know.
[24:21.79]You can see the pain in his face.
[24:23.23]Real.
[24:23.59]What?
[24:25.03]You guys are really fucking annoying.
[24:26.57]You're all invited.
[24:27.53]Hey, can you play Cave Story OST?
[24:36.61]That gets asked all the time.
[24:38.92]You need to buy the boots to beat this, Reel.
[24:41.20]Oh my fucking god.
[24:44.16]This is like a person.
[24:45.06]Are they here right now?
[24:46.22]Is that person here?
[24:52.62]Please talk more about sensitive topic in the chat.
[24:54.60]We love it.
[24:56.06]This is the person.
[24:56.72]That's AI.
[25:00.27]You have to tell me something is wrong, AI.
[25:03.47]You have to do the full three minute slow mode, Reel.
[25:07.65]Fuck, it's getting... I don't know.
[25:09.28]I can't tell the difference.
[25:12.46]You can buy a few of these at the market, AI.
[25:15.90]Another person.
[25:16.58]We're being gaslighted by the height police.
[25:26.34]Echo the dolphin.
[25:27.60]Oh my god, Jeremy.
[25:29.08]Please, real.
[25:31.94]How he played the game with the discount.
[25:34.62]With the, like,
[25:37.68]It's AI.
[25:38.12]What do you think?
[25:39.44]I don't know.
[25:45.81]You think it's... Is it AI?
[25:48.77]Real?
[25:51.37]It's real?
[25:52.85]I'm gonna say it.
[25:53.67]This game is trash.
[25:56.31]I feel like people say that every stream.
[26:00.27]But it's very specific.
[26:06.93]AI.
[26:09.06]This is a good game.
[26:09.88]You just need to be really good at it.
[26:12.72]That smells very real.
[26:14.08]That smells like AI to me.
[26:20.20]Yep.
[26:20.56]Alright.
[26:20.78]We're at six.
[26:22.80]Are you going to play the other games too?
[26:24.42]I mean, this is a simple question.
[26:25.78]I think, I think so.
[26:27.64]Are you going to play the other games too?
[26:35.82]All AI.
[26:36.48]All of them are going to be AI.
[26:38.12]Real?
[26:40.81]Oh, I could tell.
[26:42.07]Alright, I gotta get to 10.
[26:43.07]That's what made me get fired my job, AI.
[26:47.77]Why are you playing this game again, AI?
[26:51.83]It seems like you somehow downgraded your audio solution, Reel.
[26:55.95]I get shit for that all the time.
[26:59.24]If I remember right, Jerma actually read the message, which is why I got in trouble.
[27:09.69]was but you got in fucking trouble this is so weird Jerma is the first person who actually uses the stealth mechanics in this game that's a fucking that's an ai I have never ever truly used stealth mechanics in a stealth video game I get shit for it all the time I can't do it I'm horrible this is this is ai
[27:35.51]What was it from?
[27:37.61]Metro 2033.
[27:38.33]How the hell do you remember that?
[27:41.85]How do you possibly remember that?
[27:45.55]This is my first Jerma stream and I'm enthralled, AI.
[27:48.67]Whatever.
[27:49.99]He never actually moved to Vegas.
[27:51.29]It's all been soundbites, Reel.
[27:54.75]You can use the item menu to find what you want, AI.
[27:59.04]It's got the Dark Souls filter and saturation.
[28:02.90]Reel.
[28:06.35]They were dry, so it was just like sunflower seeds.
[28:09.42]Yeah.
[28:14.62]AI.
[28:16.06]God damn it.
[28:19.58]ASMR Jerm acquises you on an app you barely use.
[28:22.74]Real.
[28:24.20]Streamer changed sus so he won't be late.
[28:26.54]Real.
[28:27.86]What if you did it in the wrong order?
[28:29.92]AI.
[28:31.40]That's too many kids.
[28:32.46]They'll go back to their parents.
[28:34.46]Oh, I don't know.
[28:42.63]Real?
[28:45.33]This feels AI.
[28:46.11]This feels very AI.
[28:47.63]Real.
[28:48.41]God damn it.
[28:49.13]I should have went with my gut.
[28:52.80]Hour and a half to finally get to gameplay.
[28:54.72]Real?
[28:56.28]Oh my god.
[28:56.78]He's still in paperclip Londo.
[28:59.46]I know what stream that's from.
[29:00.44]That's real.
[29:03.15]You should have taken someone with better lockpicking.
[29:05.49]This could be fake.
[29:12.57]Real.
[29:14.55]Old man gives himself blood pressure live on stream.
[29:18.16]Give myself blood pressure?
[29:27.48]What?
[29:29.94]Old man gives himself blood pressure on stream.
[29:37.20]You know what they say about a man with a big ass dick?
[29:45.42]Not real.
[29:47.63]I don't know.
[29:48.67]What do they say, guy in Jerma chat?
[29:52.03]Why would you write that?
[29:58.12]I just got here and you're still on this level?
[30:00.12]What the fuck?
[30:00.90]It's too good.
[30:02.01]Check out this clip.
[30:31.92]That's the problem with this generation is nobody's reading books anymore.
[30:35.01]You know what I'm saying?
[30:37.95]Like that's a problem.
[30:39.15]People aren't reading anymore.
[30:40.65]This is AI.
[30:48.65]You should be reading a book a week.
[30:52.91]It's actually, it's offensive to me that people are not reading at least one to two books a week.
[31:00.52]Can I get rid of this one?
[31:07.71]Why?
[31:08.25]Watch Jerma985 live playing Clocktower 3?
[31:13.49]That's not currently happening.
[31:15.19]What?
[31:15.45]Okay.
[31:19.48]I don't know what this is.
[31:28.88]AI generated clip?
[31:30.36]It's not possible.
[31:32.04]No, this has to be real.
[31:33.42]How would anybody be able to... No, it has to be real.
[31:36.36]Has to be.
[31:37.64]There's no way this is not real.
[31:39.20]Absolutely impossible.
[31:40.97]The AI wouldn't do this.
[31:44.59]Right?
[31:44.81]Okay.
[31:49.89]Is this the guy who couldn't beat preschool games yesterday?
[31:52.79]Yes, it is.
[31:54.71]I got my first gift sub in a week.
[31:59.09]I want to see you have a stroke.
[32:03.26]No, you don't.
[32:03.78]What the fuck?
[32:05.65]I forgot about the part of this game where you rode a giant fat gold dude like a train.
[32:25.79]Oh my god, my eye!
[32:27.30]Did you see that?
[32:28.00]My eyelid got stuck!
[32:29.72]My eyelid got stuck!
[32:35.46]He hasn't sunk this low until now, real.
[32:38.02]That was even better the second time around, robot.
[32:41.50]Oh my god, I'm never gonna get 10.
[32:44.74]Just get a saddle and ride the horse, real.
[32:46.98]Oh my god, I thought it was in Red Dead.
[32:48.70]So, Roby is confirmed for next Jerm or Rumble.
[32:51.61]I don't know, I don't know what that is.
[32:54.48]There was no best ice cream this year.
[32:56.02]I'm sad.
[32:56.72]Real.
[32:57.88]Jerma's wearing the foam Hulk hands as he plays.
[33:00.42]Real.
[33:01.81]I'm not falling for this shit again.
[33:03.11]Neither am I. Hey guys, I'm back.
[33:09.61]What's up with this game?
[33:11.25]AI.
[33:13.13]You can use the fire staff in the house.
[33:15.73]AI.
[33:17.35]It all went bad because he has no friends.
[33:19.49]That's real.
[33:23.25]I, TM, am going to watch your AI.
[33:25.77]Yeah, he got glitched out there a little bit, Mr. Robot.
[33:31.10]I'm going to take a nap.
[33:32.26]Thanks for the stream.
[33:33.08]Hmm.
[33:41.11]Probably real.
[33:42.85]What the fuck?
[33:43.43]I swear to God, I say that all the time.
[33:44.85]I can't believe this game was made by a fucking gnome.
[33:47.05]Real.
[33:49.43]I think you can use the same hero to do the same thing, AI.
[33:53.81]Secret bub?
[33:58.19]What is a secret bub?
[34:01.36]Jerma, are you sure about this?
[34:02.76]These are get really hard, real.
[34:06.74]There's a secret ending if you go through the red door.
[34:10.86]AI.
[34:12.90]Why is he doing all the DLC again, real?
[34:15.85]What the fuck?
[34:16.65]I'm never gonna get more than 10.
[34:18.93]I'm sorry, Jerma, but you can't have a bad time.
[34:20.83]That's AI.
[34:22.23]Real question is, why did you play this game?
[34:24.17]Real.
[34:25.27]People... I'm gonna go watch the VOD just in case.
[34:32.97]AI.
[34:33.93]If I find a place that does that, I'll be arrested for arson.
[34:37.16]At real.
[34:38.58]Jerma versus internet, real.
[34:40.76]You should try to get the perfect ending.
[34:42.76]That's AI.
[34:44.66]Mystery streams means he doesn't have a plan.
[34:47.52]Absolutely real, because that's very, very true.
[34:49.96]I said that like a month ago.
[34:52.14]Mystery streams mean I had no idea what I was doing until about 15 minutes before the stream turns on.
[34:57.81]By the way, there's a mystery stream.
[34:59.93]Maybe like once or twice a week.
[35:03.33]Come on, Jerma, play some Simpsons music to charge yourself with rage, real.
[35:08.12]You can just do a backflip for the items.
[35:10.80]AI.
[35:12.70]I think I'm just gonna go.
[35:14.02]That's kind of sad.
[35:25.31]I'm sorry for being late.
[35:26.41]I didn't mean to tell you that.
[35:27.73]That's AI.
[35:29.23]One more.
[35:31.35]Well, now VR is becoming a thing, so... Has to be AI.
[35:41.11]Oh, god damn it.
[35:42.05]Jerma's going to stream the new Animal Crossing.
[35:43.79]Fake.
[35:44.91]I want to see you get beaten up.
[35:46.37]Real.
[35:48.99]I do believe they've made a penis.
[35:51.15]AI.
[35:53.01]You're not a real gamer if you don't play Fortnite.
[35:54.81]Real.
[35:57.20]I wish this game was more about zombies and less about what time it is.
[36:00.08]Real.
[36:01.00]Talking about Dead Rising.
[36:02.58]Jerma, you have to be on the edge of the world.
[36:04.96]AI.
[36:05.96]Jerma, this fucking sucks.
[36:06.98]Please just play a game.
[36:07.98]Real.
[36:09.25]You can also find the GameCube version of this game.
[36:15.31]Real.
[36:25.74]I've been trying to beat the last boss of Sekiro for the last eight hours straight with no breaks.
[36:30.94]I don't think I can do it.
[36:40.97]Why not just be in an airplane that flies fast enough to constantly stay at 3 p.m.? ?
[36:53.14]like time zones so I can stream okay the context there is I was saying I my the time zones are all over the place there's a lot of EU people here and it's like we got to find a good time for you to stream oh but like you stream it like two three o'clock pacific that's so late it's like well it's time zones man I can't change that and then somebody wrote why don't you just get an airplane that goes fast enough to be at 3 p.m what would happen
[37:21.76]a device or like a vehicle that could constantly be at the certain point of the globe where it was 3 o'clock.
[37:31.39]What would happen?
[37:33.07]Would it be 3 o'clock for everybody?
[37:37.17]Would it be 3 p.m.
[37:38.31]everywhere?
[37:38.79]What if you could go fast enough?
[37:40.25]It'd be time travel.
[37:43.35]You'd... No, it would only be 3 p.m.
[37:46.81]in the device.
[37:52.95]Oh yeah, this is why it's bad, unless you're in the same room.
[37:57.29]Real.
[37:59.05]So chat, has he said anything about streaming today?
[38:01.56]That's AI.
[38:08.74]About how crazy and insi- Ah, we got an at, that's real.
[38:12.18]I remember when Jerma was a dad, AI.
[38:14.86]It's a very good game, but I don't think it's the best one, AI.
[38:18.24]What the fuck is actually- What the fuck, I actually need Xbox Live to go forward, real.
[38:23.41]We already told you Super Mario Bros.
[38:25.27]2 isn't in this.
[38:26.13]That's... I don't know.
[38:30.77]But wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:31.47]Were they talking about Mario Maker?
[38:34.07]I don't know if that's AI.
[38:34.78]They might be talking about Mario Maker 2.
[38:36.24]Because I was like, oh, I want to make like a Mario 2 level.
[38:40.36]Real.
[38:41.24]Yep.
[38:43.66]I knew it.
[38:44.14]Ster was holding back.
[38:45.08]Now for his true form.
[38:49.35]Hmm.
[38:53.83]Okay.
[38:55.25]Why do you have a tarantula in your house?
[38:57.17]I don't.
[38:59.99]Jerma is the most famous person on the planet.
[39:12.50]Somebody may have written this, though.
[39:14.32]Even though it's not true.
[39:17.62]God damn it.
[39:18.38]Alright, last run and I'm done.
[39:21.52]Last run.
[39:25.63]This is like a real game, Jerma.
[39:27.39]I can't believe it.
[39:28.35]That's fake.
[39:30.43]You said you blasted Katamari in your car with an angry face.
[39:33.65]Real.
[39:35.11]You can use it to get more heroes.
[39:36.49]Real.
[39:37.45]No, one more.
[39:39.15]The game is making you play this game.
[39:40.75]That's fake.
[39:41.98]You can make a new house with this mod.
[39:43.84]Fake.
[39:45.26]I think he's going to be like, what the fuck?
[39:46.70]I'm not going to play this game anymore.
[39:48.68]Real.
[39:49.48]Oh my god.
[39:52.60]If you play the game, the audio is muted.
[39:54.18]Real.
[39:54.36]Real.
[39:56.31]You gotta get two more and name them coffee and chicken.
[39:59.37]Real.
[40:00.63]Surprised by his own tendons in his hand.
[40:02.91]Omega lul.
[40:03.51]Real.
[40:05.01]Why do you have to look at the screen?
[40:06.41]Fake.
[40:07.29]Speaking of the screen, what's with the scanlines?
[40:09.94]Get a snap for the vacation album.
[40:11.84]Real.
[40:13.62]Did you know that Jerma is a furry?
[40:15.16]Real.
[40:16.58]I'm done.
[40:18.10]Alright, I'm done.
[40:18.64]I'm done.
[40:19.02]I'm done.
[40:19.28]This was a lot of fun.
[40:20.62]What's with the scanlines?
[40:23.16]Now it's time...
[40:28.59]Do the greatest video games of all time.
[40:31.19]I don't like these scan lines here.
[40:33.39]I gotta fix this.
[40:38.03]Uh, by the way, now I'll tell you what those websites were.
[40:41.54]That is the, that is the, that one was cameo.Jerma.io.
[40:46.82]In fact, there's a lot of stuff in the Jerma.io.
[40:51.04]By the same people in person that made the Rubik's Cube Saw game.
[40:56.50]So, some really, actually really cool stuff.
[41:00.44]That's really funny.
[41:02.09]I saw that and I had to stream it.
[41:03.63]It just seems ridiculous.
[41:06.93]Why is Jerma background moving?
[41:08.23]It's because of the scan lines.
[41:09.43]I gotta fix this.
[41:20.24]Did I fix it?
[41:21.42]What's with these scanlines?
[41:22.40]Stop that.
[41:24.89]What the hell?
[41:35.90]Does anybody else believe that every fucking webcam that's made in the last 10 years never increased in technology?
[41:43.93]They just put, they put a new name on it and just, it's like, oh, this one is, came out like a year ago.
[41:52.40]It's the exact same webcam that came out 10 years ago.
[41:55.58]No technology has changed.
[42:00.35]I don't think... Has a webcam come out in the last, like, 10 years that has 1080p scanlines?
[42:07.18]You need a fucking floodlight to see yourself.
[42:14.26]It's not even... It doesn't even look like 1080p.
[42:18.56]It's your monitor room's light.
[42:23.67]Yeah, but this doesn't happen all the time.
[42:27.77]Hold on.
[42:31.47]Oh, it just made me some more red.
[42:33.71]It looks scary.
[42:40.73]Why is it doing this?
[42:43.09]Change the webcam's FPS.
[42:44.99]Yeah, why the fuck do I have to... Alright, we're going to put it at 50Hz.
[42:49.70]60Hz.
[42:49.96]Alright, I'm going to put it at
[43:01.41]60, 30 FPS.
[43:04.83]Oh my god, what happened?
[43:09.38]What happened?
[43:17.14]You know, I always wondered, like, there's streamers that have, like, full-on, like, DSLRs pointing down at them.
[43:23.18]I was like, why do people do that?
[43:25.26]And now I kind of understand now.
[43:28.33]Webcams are such dogshit.
[43:31.67]And they're never gonna get better.
[43:33.11]We good?
[43:35.35]It's like, we can only wait for so long for them to make a webcam that's not, like, a piece of fucking dogshit.
[43:43.67]It's been, like, 12 years.
[43:49.16]Alright, here we go.
[43:50.25]We good?
