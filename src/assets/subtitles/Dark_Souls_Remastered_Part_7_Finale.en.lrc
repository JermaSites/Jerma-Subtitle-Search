[00:01.73]Hello, everybody.
[00:05.11]Welcome to the stream.
[00:06.75]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:11.12]Clear off my desk just a little bit before we go.
[00:13.62]Uh-huh.
[00:18.42]Uh-huh.
[00:19.13]Let's see what this sounds like.
[00:23.63]Glass.
[00:24.01]That's what it is.
[00:26.68]Smart stuff today.
[00:28.16]We're learning about glass.
[00:29.22]I thought it was plastic.
[00:30.66]Give me one second.
[00:35.83]Make sure the tweet went through, and we'll get started.
[01:04.09]Stop doing crack.
[01:06.97]Why do you think I do crack?
[01:07.71]Because you heard glass clank?
[01:09.37]You think I'm doing crack?
[01:12.85]There are plenty of other things that make glass sounds.
[01:16.83]Glass is one of them.
[01:17.77]You know, glass bottles.
[01:21.63]Monitors are made out of glass.
[01:24.56]I could have just been clanking two monitors together.
[01:26.50]Am I smoking my monitors?
[01:29.44]No.
[01:32.08]Anywho, let's do this.
[01:34.06]Welcome to the final Dark Souls stream.
[01:38.14]We don't need to sit there and listen to the intro for any longer.
[01:42.17]I'm here.
[01:42.45]I'm ready to go.
[01:44.77]So, uh, there are some things that need to be done.
[01:48.49]I am well aware.
[01:51.75]Stop doing crack.
[01:53.53]Now, I refuse to let that become, like, a thing on this channel.
[01:56.93]I don't want anyone to spread around the rumor that, like, this streamer does crack.
[02:03.00]Don't do that.
[02:06.04]Like, there's no reason for that.
[02:08.60]You could call me, like, small.
[02:10.96]You can, like, make fun of me for being stupid and, like, making dumb mistakes.
[02:15.88]But I don't do crack, okay?
[02:19.66]You can't have that one, guys.
[02:21.08]You cannot.
[02:21.86]I'm not gonna let you have it.
[02:22.82]Well, you can't have any of those either, okay?
[02:33.79]I'm taking them all off the menu.
[02:36.64]When you come to my restaurant, you sit down, you get my joke menu.
[02:41.14]I'm telling you, so you ask for that, you look up at me, I'm the waiter, you go, uh, sir, do you have any more of the, uh, small streamer?
[02:48.15]Oh, I'm sorry, we ran out of that.
[02:49.45]Uh, you're gonna have to pick something else.
[02:51.43]Because, you know, you order the same fucking, you order the same thing every day, sir.
[02:57.78]We have other food here.
[02:59.34]There's other things on the menu.
[03:01.02]There's clown costumes on that menu.
[03:06.58]You've eaten all of it.
[03:09.08]You're the only guy that comes in and orders that off the menu.
[03:11.40]And this doesn't, we don't have any more.
[03:12.58]And I'm not gonna ship any more in.
[03:15.86]Now we got crack on the menu.
[03:17.90]Let me just close my window so my neighbor doesn't hear me talking about smoking crack.
[03:24.58]And let's go.
[03:26.91]Dark Souls Remastered.
[03:29.21]We are near the end of the game.
[03:31.59]At least near the end of the, we beat the DLC last time.
[03:36.21]So now we're going to be the regular game.
[03:38.87]We're going to try.
[03:39.43]I don't know.
[03:40.25]This might not be the last Dark Souls stream because I might get stuck forever.
[03:43.43]Who knows?
[03:48.88]Why am I fat rolling?
[03:49.78]This is mid-rolling.
[03:50.76]This is not fat rolling.
[03:55.02]Fat rolling is way worse than that.
[04:00.52]So, um, I do want to, here's something I want to do.
[04:03.48]I want to go back to the greataxe.
[04:05.26]Just because I haven't used it in a while.
[04:07.90]I also want to upgrade it.
[04:10.10]So I need to get dragon, uh, dragon glass.
[04:14.84]I know that's not what it's called, but that's the only thing I can think of in my brain.
[04:21.07]So let me do this at first.
[04:22.03]We're just going to wait like the pig helmet for a little bit.
[04:25.19]I want to wear this again, because this was fun.
[04:28.39]Yeah, we're gonna get dragon crack.
[04:31.49]So, I need to go... I need to go to the bottom of the tree.
[04:38.21]Again.
[04:39.69]I need to get to the bottom of the tree, because at the bottom of the tree, there's crack down there.
[04:43.90]And I need it.
[04:44.94]I need it bad.
[04:46.62]As you can tell, like, you see me, like, shaking around?
[04:56.10]I don't think I ever touched that bonfire that was down there.
[05:02.18]So, I think we need to run to the bottom of the tree again.
[05:04.28]Because I want the dragon crack that's down there.
[05:15.71]I'm just... I keep saying crack.
[05:17.85]Okay, I gotta stop saying that.
[05:20.76]We told you to touch it, but you said no.
[05:22.59]No, we already went over the raspberries bit.
[05:24.79]Half of you guys were screaming at me not to touch it.
[05:26.97]Alright, so I need to go to Daughter of Chaos.
[05:31.21]And then go down from the tree.
[05:39.62]Oh god, the crack joke is already on the menu.
[05:41.42]I've already fucking ruined everything.
[05:44.84]So I need to go down from here, right?
[05:47.95]We've got a lot of new bird subs today.
[05:59.46]Let me actually put on the other... I need to put on the water ring.
[06:07.98]Can't take off that other one.
[06:09.40]This is not an illusion wall, right?
[06:11.06]No, it's not.
[06:11.62]This is just the end.
[06:16.68]I'm mid-rolling.
[06:17.54]I don't want to be mid-rolling.
[06:21.10]But I kind of just... I just need to get to the bottom of the tree.
[06:25.88]Because I miss this.
[06:26.64]I miss using the big ice cream cone.
[06:28.09]It's fun.
[06:29.42]Alright, let's go... I'm not doing... We started here, but I'm not doing the Demon Ruins.
[06:34.81]I just need to... Where the fuck am I going?
[06:36.83]How do I get out of here from here?
[06:39.49]I need to go to... No, I need to go to the other bonfire.
[06:41.95]Can I warp to the... What's the closest to the tree?
[06:50.14]Is it this one right here?
[06:52.74]Or is it one of these other ones?
[06:54.02]Maybe I should just go from Firelink.
[07:01.25]I guess I can just go up here.
[07:04.31]It's the only one I'm at.
[07:05.19]I just didn't know if there was anything that was easier to get to.
[07:16.26]I guess down is the demon ruins down there.
[07:18.00]We went down there initially and then I turned around and came back.
[07:22.34]And this takes me out and I need to go to the tree and then go all the way to the bottom of the tree because I want to upgrade this thing.
[07:27.66]I want to get this thing to a point where I want to use it.
[07:30.91]We've been using the butcher knife the whole time, and I'm still keen on it.
[07:34.97]You know, I'm still keen and Kel on that thing.
[07:36.85]I don't know if I'm completely keen on using it.
[07:41.41]I'm more Kel on this one, you know?
[07:43.99]That's why you always have to have a Kenan and a Kel.
[07:51.39]You have to have two weapons in Dark Souls, and they both have to be hilarious.
[07:55.17]Like, best show that Nickelodeon's ever made, you know what I mean?
[08:05.63]Oh my god, bad?
[08:08.11]You really think that Keenan and Kel was a bad show?
[08:15.13]Alright, we go from here.
[08:16.13]I need to go... Don't get hit by any rocks.
[08:24.45]Don't hit me with that rock.
[08:26.15]I'm just passing through.
[08:27.13]I just want to go to the tree.
[08:29.73]I don't care about anything else that you're doing.
[08:37.20]What is Dark Souls?
[08:38.14]Dark Souls is an action RPG, open world, GTA-style video game.
[08:47.32]Where you get missions, there are NPCs, you have to go unlock stuff, there's an upgrade menu.
[08:55.97]There are like 112 different cars in the game.
[09:00.41]It's a really interesting experience.
[09:03.33]My personal favorite is the GT-101.
[09:09.52]It's really fast.
[09:12.04]Oh, sorry, by the way, the cars are the weapons.
[09:14.12]I forgot to mention that as well.
[09:22.63]Alright, so here we go.
[09:24.35]Great Hollow, down.
[09:25.59]We need to get the dragonglass that's down here.
[09:28.49]And there's a boss down here too that I need to get rid of.
[09:37.30]Why am I still here?
[09:41.14]Look, I'm still here because I want to get the item to ma- I need- this thing's plus three.
[09:45.87]I want to get this thing to, like, at least plus four before moving on.
[09:49.19]All right.
[09:49.63]Rest of the bonfire.
[09:50.37]We're here.
[09:51.82]Now, let me make this easier on myself by- I need to take off- We're just gonna- we're gonna have to just do this naked.
[10:02.05]Still mid-rolling.
[10:02.97]Shit!
[10:04.07]Well, if I take off... Now I can take this ring off.
[10:05.97]No, I'm going to be in water in a minute here, but not yet.
[10:07.95]Let's put on the Havel ring.
[10:13.39]So now I should be able to wear at least some protection here.
[10:16.74]Maybe I don't even want it, though.
[10:19.66]Let's go back to the... This is just to get the item.
[10:23.24]I'm going to go quick here.
[10:27.94]Where's my Butcher's Club?
[10:29.67]There it is.
[10:31.53]Uh, I can put on at least some... Doesn't matter what it is.
[10:35.43]Stay under like 30.
[10:36.21]That's fine.
[10:43.26]It looks like I just downloaded the game.
[10:44.92]That's alright.
[10:45.40]Alright, here we go.
[10:47.22]Just gotta get to the bottom of the tree.
[10:48.76]I know the easy way to do it.
[10:51.26]Is one.
[10:53.00]Two.
[10:55.48]Don't get cursed either.
[10:56.54]I know that'll fucking happen to me.
[11:00.92]We got right there.
[11:01.94]Oh, fuck.
[11:04.66]No, I'm good.
[11:05.18]We're fine.
[11:09.62]And then there's a spot we can go right here.
[11:14.26]Trying to get this done in three falls.
[11:16.51]We're on fall number two.
[11:18.55]Well, that's fall number one.
[11:21.49]So from here we got a fall.
[11:22.59]This is fall number two.
[11:26.67]And then here comes fall number two.
[11:30.35]Into fall number two.
[11:32.31]And then fall number three.
[11:33.71]Should get us to the bottom there.
[11:34.69]Alright, that's good.
[11:44.83]Oh, yeah.
[11:45.41]No, is this going to kill me?
[11:46.77]No, it won't.
[11:48.97]I love how I did that first try.
[11:50.31]Okay, I need to avoid these fucking guys.
[11:52.16]So I'm going to go this way.
[11:55.31]Don't you fucking dare do that shit to me right now.
[11:57.75]I'm not prepared for it.
[11:58.73]Alright, I just need a... Let's go to the hole.
[12:07.88]Down, down, down.
[12:08.92]I don't want to drop.
[12:09.72]I think there's like a ladder somewhere, isn't there?
[12:11.54]Yeah, right there.
[12:18.29]Out of the way.
[12:18.95]Might as well just get rid of them.
[12:20.17]I'm going to cause myself an absolute migraine if I don't.
[12:25.84]One right at the bottom of this ladder.
[12:27.58]This is not cool.
[12:28.36]I'm going to have to kill this thing by falling and slashing.
[12:30.38]We're going to have to do a slash fall on this guy.
[12:33.60]Because he'll kill me with the... This is stupid.
[12:52.07]This is really stupid.
[12:55.13]I'm going to go from the other direction.
[12:56.01]Alright, we're going to slash fall this guy.
[12:59.25]Aye, aye, aye.
[13:04.48]I'm fine.
[13:06.10]Oh my god, I forgot the whole thing goes... I forgot that the whole... I forgot it goes even further down.
[13:20.65]I thought it would...
[13:24.41]Fucking damn it, man.
[13:32.39]Pain in the ass.
[13:33.35]God damn it.
[13:33.97]I just gotta get to the bottom of the fucking tree.
[13:35.66]Oh, shit.
[13:48.74]Twinkling Tide Knight.
[13:49.48]Alright.
[13:50.98]I didn't get that before.
[13:51.70]I'm alright with this.
[13:53.74]I forgot that the tree keeps going.
[13:55.52]I'm just going to do the safe way.
[14:05.25]Alright, the safe way.
[14:09.29]Let's just go down.
[14:10.07]Again, just don't be an idiot.
[14:14.67]I thought that after you go through this part, you go down the ladder, that that's the end.
[14:17.97]But no, I'm wrong.
[14:23.93]He fell down.
[14:24.57]Damn it, it's over here.
[14:29.85]I just want my dragon glass.
[14:32.27]Get away from me.
[14:33.01]Are you going to keep following me?
[14:38.93]Do not curse me while I'm on the ladder.
[14:40.23]Don't do that.
[14:40.65]That's the number one thing.
[14:41.79]Top ten things I don't want to have happen is that right now.
[14:43.77]Go.
[14:46.37]Okay.
[14:48.83]Don't fucking dare.
[14:51.90]Oh, shit!
[14:54.84]I feel like I was just in a play right there.
[15:01.87]Alright, I need to... Oh, shit!
[15:10.60]Here we go.
[15:11.06]Down.
[15:17.65]Don't panic.
[15:18.27]Oh, I didn't get that item.
[15:19.19]What item is that?
[15:19.82]It's probably some kind of titanite.
[15:21.98]Green titanite.
[15:23.00]Gray titanite.
[15:25.56]Orange titanite.
[15:27.82]Whatever popsicle flavor you want, they have it in this game.
[15:30.16]All right.
[15:30.68]Right here.
[15:31.22]Mushroom.
[15:31.60]I'm going to go mushroom to mushroom.
[15:33.87]Watch out for the little guys.
[15:36.15]Don't bother with them.
[15:37.55]Just get to the bottom.
[15:38.27]Okay.
[15:43.39]Now we're almost there.
[15:46.82]couple of big guys just ignore them in fact we're gonna go around oh fuck what have I done I just did like the the adam sandler thing oh my god oh my god I gotta stop panicking they're just mushroom people they're nothing they're not even they're so easy just all right I just a trade just went through on like cryptocurrency I don't know what it was it was like worth like 30 dollars though so who cares
[16:18.30]Okay.
[16:20.96]Ash Lake.
[16:24.28]There's the bonfire.
[16:25.20]I'm ready.
[16:39.25]Okay, this... Just gotta go to the bonfire.
[16:41.53]And we gotta kill this guy.
[16:43.97]I don't know how the hell we're gonna do this.
[16:50.17]Jeremiah doesn't care about $30.
[16:51.37]No, I do.
[16:52.23]I care very much about $30.
[16:54.51]But I can't... I can't care about it right now because I'm currently running away from the Great Hollow.
[16:59.33]Let's rest here.
[17:03.26]I can warp from here, so I'm not going to get stuck at the bottom of the tree.
[17:06.92]Let me explore.
[17:07.40]I didn't get a chance to even look at any of this stuff.
[17:12.26]That just goes down.
[17:13.50]Okay, cool.
[17:14.40]Okay.
[17:15.02]Okay.
[17:15.52]Anything else down here?
[17:20.65]A little crevice, maybe.
[17:25.23]No, just an invisible wall.
[17:33.18]Bitcoin market donates $30, and I ignore it?
[17:40.26]No, that was me initiating a crypto-to-crypto, cryptographic crypto trade.
[17:45.87]Alright, let's go.
[17:47.39]Let's kill this thing.
[17:49.13]Can I walk in this water?
[17:53.74]It's going to be the same thing as the other Hydra, right?
[17:55.50]It's like the same enemy, just in a different spot.
[17:59.12]So just wait until he does the... Here it comes.
[18:03.72]Alright, it is the same enemy.
[18:06.08]It's got to get a little closer.
[18:06.92]Why are you not doing the thing where you lunge forward?
[18:18.30]Here it comes.
[18:20.91]No, Jesus.
[18:21.75]What the hell?
[18:22.09]Why are you just all screaming at me at the same time?
[18:29.93]Can I go in this water?
[18:30.98]I don't know if I can walk in this water.
[18:35.96]Can I walk in this water?
[18:36.88]Alright, I just like slid down that.
[18:45.49]I did...
[18:51.53]Okay.
[18:52.45]So.
[18:54.15]Cool.
[18:55.61]Easy.
[18:55.87]I'm just going to try to lure him again.
[19:08.66]Game's too quiet?
[19:09.28]I'll turn it up after this.
[19:15.13]You're about as good as a refrigerator at swimming.
[19:18.41]I mean, this is true, but...
[19:21.09]There has to be a way to make him.
[19:22.33]Maybe if I just... Because he dives over you, doesn't he?
[19:24.59]Alright, hold on.
[19:25.82]We're close now.
[19:27.98]What if I stand right here?
[19:31.56]Just don't jump off.
[19:32.42]Can I do jumping slashes on his head?
[19:34.16]Alright, he does do it.
[19:39.87]He does do it.
[19:40.57]He does do it.
[19:41.25]I was going to say.
[19:41.97]Okay, he does do it.
[19:44.77]He's got to be close enough.
[19:56.48]Come over here.
[19:59.99]Do it.
[20:05.39]Here it comes.
[20:08.57]No, you didn't even do it.
[20:10.50]What?
[20:16.98]He's not going to do it.
[20:19.58]He's just going to keep doing that over and over again.
[20:22.95]Well, we're just going to keep going this way, because last time we did this, he jumped over.
[20:27.07]So, I'm going to wait until he jumps over.
[20:38.91]Who hit me?
[20:39.59]One of these guys hit me?
[20:42.05]You've got to be kidding me.
[20:42.91]Okay, come on.
[20:46.74]Come on.
[20:48.94]Get closer up on the shore, man.
[20:57.22]How we doing?
[20:57.74]Is it close enough?
[21:04.74]Alright, here he goes.
[21:06.74]He's gonna jump over me.
[21:08.35]He's gonna go... Yeah!
[21:18.15]Okay.
[21:23.92]So...
[21:27.63]Oh my god, there's a... There's a fucking alien behind me.
[21:37.03]That's a free twinkling titanite.
[21:40.77]You gonna shoot the water again?
[21:45.42]How the fuck am I supposed to do this?
[21:50.06]I'm really fucking close.
[21:51.44]Like, I'm very close.
[21:52.66]He's not gonna be able to shoot water from here.
[21:54.64]He's gonna have to dive in.
[21:58.07]Yeah, like... Like that.
[22:03.40]That didn't hit him?
[22:07.52]I guess I did hit him.
[22:09.24]There's no indication that he's going to do it, though.
[22:10.70]It's just like... There we go.
[22:18.45]God.
[22:22.90]Such a shit area.
[22:24.35]It's like, I'm like inside of a fucking playground right now.
[22:28.11]I can't even tell when he's gonna do it.
[22:29.61]He makes a noise.
[22:30.45]Okay, there it goes.
[22:38.55]Let's do it again.
[22:40.69]There's another one.
[22:49.25]Do it again.
[22:56.32]I don't even know where I am.
[22:57.08]I don't know where he is.
[22:58.50]If he's splashing too much in the water, don't do that.
[23:06.85]I think I got it.
[23:08.41]Yep.
[23:08.71]He's got two more, three more heads.
[23:13.09]Don't go too far.
[23:13.63]I'll fall into the water.
[23:14.37]Don't do that.
[23:15.15]Let's get this one first.
[23:25.08]Shit.
[23:28.33]Fuck this camera angle, man.
[23:35.13]God damn it!
[23:39.72]I need to put on my other weapon.
[23:42.02]Alright, you only got three heads left.
[23:53.10]Just don't get hit.
[23:58.30]Oh my fucking god, of course.
[24:00.45]I'm gonna get hit by the last fucking thing.
[24:02.25]Just watch this.
[24:04.07]I should take a humanity.
[24:10.07]No, no, no, no!
[24:12.03]Oh my... What a dumb boss.
[24:22.94]Give me the fucking other weapon.
[24:24.46]For the love of god.
[24:37.34]Like, Jesus Christ.
[24:39.72]No, no, what are you doing?
[24:41.08]Why is this happening to me?
[24:42.58]I just defied all the laws of the game.
[24:44.40]I would have just fallen off.
[24:47.70]I'm gonna stand, like, on the shore, right up his ass, while he does the same stupid fucking move over and over again.
[24:53.33]Well, that's where I'm gonna fight him.
[24:56.71]And I'm gonna have to do one swing with this, rather than three.
[25:03.01]What a god.
[25:06.80]Use the shield?
[25:07.46]No.
[25:07.92]I can't use the shield.
[25:08.96]People will make fun of me.
[25:12.38]Don't you guys know that streaming Dark Souls is just, hey, everyone, make fun of me for everything that I do?
[25:18.08]That's just how it works.
[25:18.84]Alright, hold on.
[25:25.87]He's going to do the thing.
[25:37.54]Give me my souls.
[25:42.46]I'm already making fun of him for not using his shield.
[25:44.64]You know, you have a really good point.
[25:46.88]I'm going to listen to that guy.
[25:47.88]The one guy in chat.
[25:48.78]Let's listen to him.
[25:52.93]Fucking dumb.
[25:54.31]Stupid video game.
[25:56.83]You stupid video game.
[26:01.29]Good.
[26:01.71]Kill him.
[26:03.17]I'm glad you did that.
[26:05.15]I'm
[26:09.63]Okay, go ahead and do it again.
[26:11.43]How much can I block with the shield, though?
[26:13.71]I never use the shield.
[26:15.25]What does it do?
[26:16.41]Does it block attacks?
[26:24.15]Some would say too well.
[26:28.68]I can really just stand here and eat this, can't I?
[26:40.06]You see?
[26:40.32]It's already happening.
[26:41.92]Everybody already is in the chat making fun of me right now.
[26:44.39]I can smell it.
[26:45.07]I can hear it.
[26:45.57]I can feel it in my dreams, in my nightmares, in my soul.
[26:53.11]Like, people are just sitting there laughing at me.
[26:55.17]They're staring at me.
[26:56.09]They're staring through me.
[27:03.38]Didn't kill him.
[27:09.82]Oh, woohoo.
[27:10.48]Look at the guy standing still using his shield.
[27:12.86]I'm going to be on like the... No, I'm not going to say that.
[27:18.25]He's almost dead.
[27:29.37]That didn't hit him?
[27:29.85]Come on.
[27:31.62]Alright, he needs to get hit one more time.
[27:40.56]No.
[27:43.12]Alright, I beat the boss.
[27:45.38]The Dark Souls Ash Lake boss.
[27:49.56]I got two dragon skills.
[27:50.60]That's what we came here for.
[27:51.58]Oh my god, look at that shield.
[27:58.29]How dare I put a shield on.
[28:00.07]Put a shield on.
[28:02.63]I got two dragon cracks.
[28:06.65]This...
[28:08.96]Just missed him.
[28:10.14]Just missed him.
[28:14.38]Alright, we didn't go... He's still alive?
[28:17.81]Why are you still alive?
[28:23.59]Purging Stone.
[28:24.33]Well, that's actually really good to have.
[28:25.77]Alright, so this is not over.
[28:31.20]There's Tree Part 2.
[28:33.97]I don't know.
[28:34.23]Is there an actual boss in the tree?
[28:37.72]Or is this just like an extra bonus area?
[28:41.72]We're about to find out.
[28:48.03]We didn't get this far last time.
[28:49.27]Just don't fall off.
[28:53.41]I can go down in there.
[28:54.51]Hold on, though.
[28:59.16]This keeps going, huh?
[29:03.22]How far does this go?
[29:04.02]There's a covenant in here or something, right?
[29:10.09]I guess not.
[29:26.12]No, it's just another way to go back into the tree.
[29:30.98]This is a different way, isn't it?
[29:33.73]No.
[29:34.29]Well, hold on.
[29:35.67]Let me just clear this.
[29:42.49]I'm curious as to what's in here.
[29:47.32]Yeah, I'll turn up the sound effects.
[29:48.40]Once I get a good stopping point, we'll turn up the volume.
[29:50.82]Okay, well, I don't want to fight you right there because it's a bad place.
[30:04.74]I think the fat guy's blocking the entryway.
[30:06.34]Yes, he is.
[30:12.09]Oh my god, I thought I just blew it.
[30:26.36]What happened there?
[30:28.82]What happened there?
[30:29.46]Oh well.
[30:37.71]Yeah, just like that.
[30:38.43]I like slipped off the fucking stick.
[30:46.06]This is such a far run too.
[30:47.98]Do I just say who gives a shit and just go to the end?
[30:50.66]This is pushing me down right now.
[30:56.68]Stop pushing me down.
[30:57.54]I want to go back up.
[31:00.60]Enough of this treadmill sand.
[31:01.86]Get me up there.
[31:20.30]Did I already finish the DLC?
[31:21.28]Yes, I did.
[31:22.76]We got to the end of the DLC and then I wanted to come back and pick up some dragon scales to upgrade this weapon that I'm currently holding.
[31:32.35]Okay, there's nothing there.
[31:47.44]Can I stand on this?
[31:48.58]I hope so.
[31:49.64]Yeah.
[32:01.17]This is the safe way to do this.
[32:07.33]Nobody else in here?
[32:08.47]No.
[32:11.20]You wound up a second punch.
[32:14.60]Don't do another punch.
[32:15.88]Just hold on.
[32:18.16]I'm going to fall off because the camera... This is what happens when you get in these tiny little spaces.
[32:26.79]I'm so paranoid to fight out here.
[32:30.97]Just die.
[32:31.71]Oh my god.
[32:32.71]He's got like one sliver.
[32:36.09]Why are you the hardest enemy in the game?
[32:37.37]Alright.
[32:43.09]So we made it inside this tree.
[32:44.66]Let's go get the souls.
[32:49.56]There's another one of those stupid bug eye things out here though.
[32:52.66]Okay.
[32:58.40]So can I even retrieve that stuff from here?
[33:06.40]I don't think I can even go up there.
[33:10.97]Can I jump?
[33:23.76]I guess I have to fall in from another spot or something?
[33:26.52]This is weird.
[33:32.67]There's no spot on here, right?
[33:34.67]Oh, fucking Jesus Christ, man.
[33:36.43]This place takes the cake for, like, shove the camera inside of my 3D animated skull.
[33:45.62]Oh, by the way, watch your step, because you'll fall off.
[33:51.34]I can't, like, climb up the tree or something?
[33:55.86]I guess I can go like this?
[34:00.09]But this just takes me to where I was before.
[34:04.08]I can't climb.
[34:04.62]I can't walk up that, can I?
[34:05.86]It looks like I can.
[34:07.54]Can I walk up that?
[34:13.87]That looks like, hey, please walk up me.
[34:35.25]I don't think I can.
[34:40.03]No, I definitely can't.
[34:41.03]No way.
[34:41.35]I'm just trying to see from the outside.
[34:43.95]Like, how do you even... I have no idea.
[34:46.83]There's only one way to find out?
[34:47.93]Yeah, it's called on the way back.
[34:57.64]How can you be sure, though?
[35:00.82]I don't think I want to be sure.
[35:02.80]I'd rather have it be a mystery.
[35:15.58]My god, this is forever This is who made this fucking roller coaster tycoon queue line That's what it looks like that's what it feels like All right, we made it to the end and then thank god there's a bonfire here.
[35:38.83]Oh god.
[35:40.55]Oh
[35:44.09]This is not going to be some scenario where... God damn it.
[35:50.57]Is this a boss?
[36:01.04]No, it's not.
[36:01.62]This is an NPC.
[36:03.14]Pray to the everlasting dragons.
[36:06.91]What covenant?
[36:07.39]I'm in the cat covenant, right?
[36:14.92]I just keep joining other covenants.
[36:21.49]I'm the most not loyal servant of any of these people.
[36:27.91]Dragon headstone and dragon eye.
[36:31.58]Offer... No, I have to give him dragon scales?
[36:36.10]I don't want... I can't do that.
[36:37.92]I need these.
[36:41.14]Cut his tail.
[36:45.75]No.
[36:47.47]I don't know.
[36:48.69]This is kind of... I'm gonna get in big trouble.
[36:57.06]I'm gonna... I'm gonna fight... Oh, no.
[36:59.06]Okay.
[37:02.62]Where's... I'm nervous right now.
[37:07.39]I need to open up my junk box and throw half the shit in the trash.
[37:10.45]Alright, where is it?
[37:19.93]Is this actually gonna give me a weapon?
[37:21.79]What about my covenant?
[37:31.28]I pray to thee!
[37:33.28]Dragon greatsword?
[37:37.90]Are you sure he doesn't care about that?
[37:41.94]What the fuck is that?
[37:49.63]Did I go by it?
[37:50.21]Is it number one?
[37:50.87]Where is it?
[37:52.98]Dragon Greatsword.
[37:54.12]It needs 50 to hold it in one hand.
[38:01.60]Ultra Greatsword.
[38:02.50]This sword, one of the rare dragon weapons, came from the tale of the stone dragon of Ash Lake, descendant of the ancient dragons.
[38:08.06]Its great mystical power will be unleashed when wielded with two hands.
[38:21.30]Oh yeah, watch out!
[38:22.78]Watch out for the great dragon potato skin!
[38:24.82]I mean, the thing is kind of cool, but does that drop durability?
[38:38.85]I'm sure it does.
[38:44.03]Yeah, it does.
[38:45.02]50 durability every time you do that.
[38:46.44]390 at base level, though.
[38:49.44]What is the dragon greatsword?
[38:52.59]All these fucking things have such a similar name.
[38:54.13]Dragon King Greataxe.
[38:55.53]Okay, now this is... I think I already got this going.
[39:00.56]I'm going to be leveling this one up.
[39:04.02]Yeah, it's just a... That's alright.
[39:05.88]It's cool, though.
[39:07.22]Well, thanks for the stuff.
[39:08.50]See you later.
[39:10.71]So, we got the... I want to go level up this weapon.
[39:13.07]That means we have to go to the... Parish, right?
[39:17.91]Undead Parish.
[39:19.39]Go level this up to plus four.
[39:27.93]I just cut his tail for no reason.
[39:29.11]Yeah, that's true.
[39:32.56]Check.
[39:33.24]Is the dragon head an item?
[39:34.68]Like an actual wearable item?
[39:44.76]Where is it?
[39:46.30]Dragon scale.
[39:53.45]Soul of Madness.
[39:54.23]I didn't even do anything with this.
[39:57.04]Same thing with the Guardian Soul.
[39:57.94]I gotta get rid of this shit, man.
[39:59.16]I need to... Why am I still holding on to it?
[40:03.29]Prism Stone.
[40:06.21]Purging Stone.
[40:07.21]What the hell is it?
[40:07.99]Dragon Head.
[40:08.57]Gain Dragon Head and emit Dragon Breath.
[40:11.47]Oh, it's this thing.
[40:13.29]Yeah.
[40:14.42]You put it on your bar and you can spit out Dragon Fire.
[40:23.83]I do need something for it.
[40:24.87]Please reinforce my Dragon King Greataxe.
[40:32.27]Two Dragon Skills.
[40:33.34]Needed to get it to plus four.
[40:34.52]I don't mind if I do.
[40:36.68]Now, to get it to plus five, I need three more Dragon Skills, which, don't ask me where the hell I get them.
[40:45.56]Alright, let me turn the volume up as well.
[40:56.07]That should be better.
[40:56.69]Alright, this is plus four.
[41:09.26]Got the other one from the lake already.
[41:10.88]Yeah, there was one that was hanging out at the lake.
[41:15.20]Now, what about... You get them from dragons, right?
[41:17.92]I never killed the dragon that was on the bridge.
[41:20.09]Remember the bridge dragon?
[41:21.95]Let me...
[41:27.30]Can't really put anything on here.
[41:28.52]I guess I could put on, like, the hood.
[41:30.20]Just can't go past, like, 30.
[41:35.39]Is that still... No, that's still alright.
[41:46.31]This is higher now, though, right?
[41:48.23]It's like 31 or 32.
[41:49.19]Yeah, it's like 32.
[41:52.52]You can't just be naked, man.
[41:55.58]You don't look good.
[41:58.67]33.
[41:58.71]Let's see if I can do it with the Shadow Lake.
[42:02.95]Hey, we're still rolling pretty fine.
[42:04.35]Alright, good.
[42:07.18]Yeah, because wasn't there, um... The dragon on the bridge.
[42:11.72]There was that dragon that was lying down on the side in the Valley of the Drakes that I never did anything with.
[42:16.09]I just ran by him.
[42:19.13]Right?
[42:19.31]Okay.
[42:24.67]Stone Dragon, Sanctuary Garden.
[42:26.21]Alright, let me think here.
[42:27.97]If I went to... From Firelink to New Londo.
[42:37.96]New Londo to Valley of the Drakes.
[42:43.24]That's what I'm thinking.
[42:45.40]That's what I'm thinking.
[42:46.04]That's what I'm going to do.
[42:57.23]Because then that brings me to the side where he was lying.
[42:59.93]That should be correct.
[43:03.35]I think I'm correct.
[43:15.72]Do I like GTA or Dark Souls more?
[43:17.74]I mean, that's... I'm not sure that's a fair question.
[43:23.87]They're both equally fantastic series.
[43:28.00]I mean, that's like... That's okay.
[43:31.08]A more fair assessment is, do you like Saints Row or GTA more?
[43:37.71]You know?
[43:38.49]Those two are in the same category.
[43:42.45]You just said this is a GTA-styled game?
[43:45.61]Yeah, stylized-wise.
[43:49.22]I, like, forgot my own bullshit.
[43:51.16]Sorry, guys.
[43:51.88]Alright, let's go this way, right?
[43:56.08]And he should be hanging out right here.
[43:59.96]There he is.
[44:00.40]Okay.
[44:01.74]Am I equipped to fight him now?
[44:07.91]What does he drop?
[44:15.51]He's just going to start fighting me, right?
[44:16.57]Alright.
[44:17.11]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[44:18.19]Alright.
[44:20.69]I don't know what he does for moves.
[44:21.83]He's going to swing with his... Is that poison or...
[44:34.79]Okay, he's gonna have to dodge.
[44:42.63]Oh, shit.
[44:43.33]Oh, shit!
[44:43.93]Okay, I thought he was gonna breathe the stuff out of his mouth.
[44:53.96]Fuck!
[44:54.32]Fuck, dude.
[44:59.64]Damn, this thing's too slow.
[45:03.80]He's too slow.
[45:04.70]I gotta put the other thing on.
[45:07.80]He's too quick.
[45:22.66]Whoops-a-daisy!
[45:27.95]My approach is so awful here.
[45:36.61]In fact, I don't even get in front of him.
[45:38.23]What's the point of doing that?
[45:41.10]Just bait out the goo.
[45:45.48]And then go around, and then run back.
[45:47.20]Just give him one slash.
[45:48.76]He's going to slash with his hand here.
[45:49.94]Nope.
[45:50.08]Okay, yeah.
[45:51.66]We're good.
[45:57.32]This thing's doing more damage.
[45:58.57]Anyways.
[45:58.77]It's because he's a dragon, right?
[46:03.14]Takes less damage from dragon items.
[46:04.76]One more hit and he's dead.
[46:21.95]Alright, what do I get for this?
[46:27.10]One dragon skill?
[46:27.92]That's it?
[46:30.34]That's all I get for killing that guy?
[46:33.29]Damn.
[46:33.73]Okay.
[46:35.87]Well.
[46:37.15]What about these guys down here?
[46:39.15]So I have two.
[46:39.79]I need two more.
[46:44.98]These are the lightning dragons.
[46:49.86]I wonder if I can take care of these guys in like a couple of swings now.
[46:52.00]Before it was like almost impossible to fight them.
[47:01.18]Well, okay.
[47:01.94]What is it?
[47:02.20]How many hits?
[47:02.56]I mean, they're still fairly hard to kill.
[47:06.62]Alright, what do you drop?
[47:12.94]Nothing.
[47:16.40]I feel like I could use this for these guys.
[47:18.40]It's a 5% drop rate?
[47:24.90]Oh, man.
[47:34.79]Come on, give me two.
[47:35.73]Give me, like, wicked lucky rolls here.
[47:41.66]There's five of them down in Ash Lake.
[47:42.98]I think I already got all the ones in Ash Lake.
[47:45.16]I remember I ran through and I collected them all.
[47:50.54]Eat a humanity and put on a farm ring to give yourself item discovery.
[47:55.04]I mean, I don't know.
[47:55.90]Is it really... Is it worth it?
[47:58.16]I'm not sure it's worth it.
[48:05.62]I mean, that kind of was not fair.
[48:08.50]I mean, kind of.
[48:09.04]I mean, it was unfair.
[48:10.16]Alright, so you're saying I don't like farm these guys.
[48:25.65]No, I don't think this is worth it.
[48:27.53]Even with item discovery, it was going to be like 20%.
[48:31.12]I'm gonna use the butcher's axe anyways.
[48:32.70]I just wanted to do... We had stuff to clean up.
[48:35.22]Let me see if I can kill all three of these guys at the same time.
[48:44.96]The bonfire's close.
[48:45.79]You can farm them.
[48:50.83]Come on.
[48:51.47]No!
[48:51.53]Why'd you jump back?
[48:52.99]Oh, fuck it.
[48:53.45]I don't even care.
[48:53.97]Just get me out of here.
[48:58.71]Yeah.
[48:59.81]I mean, okay, if that dragon... If that big dragon dropped two, it might be worth it.
[49:03.85]But, no.
[49:05.49]This thing's plus four.
[49:06.44]That's good enough.
[49:09.86]Let's keep going what we were doing before.
[49:11.28]Well, how much do I have left to do?
[49:19.22]Uh, I have... I have...
[49:26.12]New Londo.
[49:27.00]So let's go back to Firelink.
[49:28.02]I have to kill the boss in New Londo that I couldn't do before.
[49:34.72]So let's go to New Londo.
[49:37.12]Warp to Firelink.
[49:46.45]Kill the boss in New Londo and then go to the Duke's Archives and actually play through the Duke's Archives.
[50:00.23]So, I'm going to keep this set up just because I want to play with this thing for a little while because we've been doing butcher knife the whole game.
[50:05.43]Or at least the later half of the game.
[50:08.11]Let's go back to the big weapon.
[50:10.63]Fast rolling big weapon.
[50:16.57]I almost just walked off that edge because that's the wrong way to go.
[50:20.35]Don't go there if you play that game.
[50:21.62]Don't do that.
[50:22.26]Go this way.
[50:26.42]What the fuck am I doing?
[50:27.68]Like, it's over here behind the tree.
[50:30.75]Literally just did it.
[50:34.39]And then we go from here to here.
[50:35.43]And then now I have to remember the shortcuts that I unlocked here in New Londo.
[50:49.64]It was run straight and then fall to the right.
[50:54.26]You fall down onto the ground.
[50:56.43]And then you go around and up.
[50:59.41]This might take a few times.
[51:02.85]Nermous the Devil?
[51:03.65]Funny when he's drunk?
[51:07.35]I'm not drunk.
[51:13.81]Oh, god damn it.
[51:14.89]No Estus.
[51:15.83]Shit!
[51:17.45]I forgot there's no bonfire here.
[51:19.01]Go back up.
[51:25.30]There's no bonfire down here to replenish.
[51:36.27]No, I'm not going to bone home.
[51:37.87]That is lazy.
[51:39.11]Okay.
[51:52.80]Plus ten.
[51:56.32]Well, I just want to see.
[51:57.80]I'm not going to kindle it yet.
[52:00.42]No, yeah I am.
[52:01.38]Who am I fucking kidding?
[52:02.94]Kindle it.
[52:03.54]No, don't even think about it.
[52:05.18]Play.
[52:05.38]Play.
[52:15.99]Might as well pop souls and level... Not yet.
[52:18.78]Let me see how much trouble this is giving me.
[52:21.32]If I get in the boss fight and it's like, this is... Wow, I'm not going to be able to beat this shit.
[52:26.66]Why would you not?
[52:28.98]Um... Because I don't know.
[52:38.95]I'd rather try it first.
[52:40.13]I'm into the idea of trying to figure out even where the hell I am.
[52:45.57]So we're gonna go over here.
[52:48.25]Oh, wait a minute.
[52:48.67]I need that curse.
[52:50.05]Just in case I get locked in here, right?
[53:02.96]I'm gonna lose 20,000 souls?
[53:06.06]God damn it.
[53:06.73]You're right.
[53:07.47]You're fucking right.
[53:08.35]You're right.
[53:09.05]You are just right.
[53:10.85]But we're gonna first try this boss.
[53:20.71]So if I remember, it was... 20,000 is not that big of a... It's not.
[53:29.79]Spaghetti arms.
[53:32.26]And then it's over here.
[53:33.50]Fall off this, right?
[53:36.56]Been a while since we've been here.
[53:37.82]Yeah, fall down here.
[53:40.92]There are a couple little dickheads that are here, right?
[53:42.84]And I go around this way.
[53:49.53]Am I going the right way here?
[53:52.58]Up and through door?
[53:55.10]Up and through door?
[53:57.24]Is this correct?
[54:02.40]I think we're... This is correct.
[54:04.22]Okay, here we go.
[54:07.19]Fight boss.
[54:07.69]Ring, ring, ring.
[54:16.35]What do you mean ring?
[54:17.17]Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.
[54:19.91]Is there a person behind me?
[54:21.83]Is somebody running up the stairs?
[54:24.30]Okay.
[54:24.64]Ring.
[54:25.06]Ring.
[54:25.36]Ring.
[54:25.58]Ring.
[54:25.82]Ring.
[54:32.64]Oh.
[54:33.38]This ring.
[54:35.18]This is the ring.
[54:36.00]Okay.
[54:36.56]Right.
[54:37.30]This ring.
[54:37.96]I'm mid-rolling, though.
[54:40.61]Do I have to take... Can I take that off?
[54:41.95]Why do I have to have that on?
[54:42.93]It's in my inventory.
[54:50.13]33.
[54:50.19]Just take off the gloves, right?
[54:51.25]Okay.
[54:53.50]No, I need way more than that.
[55:02.35]I still... No.
[55:04.65]We're going to do Butcher's Knife because I don't know anything about this shit.
[55:07.85]So we're doing Butcher's Knife.
[55:09.01]We're going to put on some just standard items.
[55:15.87]We're going to have the Night Helm.
[55:19.32]Uh, let's just put the one... Wait, I can't go past... What?
[55:22.75]I can't go past 20, I don't think.
[55:24.61]Or, like, 15, actually.
[55:31.37]I'm gonna do this off the edge, and it's gonna fucking drive me crazy.
[55:33.43]Alright.
[55:34.09]This is okay still.
[55:35.11]17.
[55:35.68]That should be fine.
[55:42.04]Alright, we're good.
[55:42.66]Let's do it.
[55:43.04]We can go to 20+.
[55:45.98]I'm at 19... Mmm...
[55:54.50]painted Guardian.
[55:55.12]I just lost... Alright, that's good.
[56:01.01]Shield?
[56:01.31]The shield's gotta stay on.
[56:06.51]I want the stamina from the shield.
[56:08.99]Do I need... Okay, the curse... This is probably... This boss probably requires the curse, right?
[56:12.82]No, don't... Don't throw all your stuff away.
[56:26.84]Am I gonna take damage from this?
[56:36.95]Oh!
[56:37.79]Okay.
[56:38.99]Another darkness boss.
[56:40.59]This is great.
[56:41.05]Are they invisible?
[56:44.93]Oh god.
[56:51.85]What the fuck is that?
[56:54.40]What is that?
[56:54.80]Why is it still coming at me?
[56:56.02]What the hell?
[56:56.58]What's with this thing?
[56:57.34]It's a fucking boomerang!
[56:58.82]Get it away from me!
[57:00.10]How do I get away from this?
[57:01.89]Help me!
[57:02.91]Somebody please help me!
[57:04.47]It won't leave me alone!
[57:07.19]What?
[57:10.29]It seriously won't leave me the fuck alone!
[57:18.36]What is he doing?
[57:18.90]Explosion?
[57:20.14]Yeah, of course it is.
[57:25.72]Aye.
[57:30.62]Shit.
[57:34.00]Oh my god.
[57:35.10]Oh my god, I don't know his fucking moves.
[57:39.33]He's dead.
[57:44.95]No, okay.
[57:45.79]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:47.44]There's four of them.
[57:48.18]There's four of them.
[57:51.06]Oh no, that's not good.
[57:53.57]Jake out of the controller.
[57:54.65]No, do not do a taunt.
[57:57.59]What did he just do to me?
[58:06.03]Oh my fucking god.
[58:13.16]Here comes more magic missiles.
[58:15.56]Where are they coming from?
[58:20.20]Die!
[58:20.96]No, don't kick him, you fucking idiot!
[58:24.93]Oh my god, damn it!
[58:30.59]He's almost dead!
[58:32.82]Don't get greedy, don't get greedy.
[58:33.96]Pull it back, pull it back, pull it back.
[58:35.08]Pull it all the way back.
[58:36.88]I have plenty of Estus.
[58:42.16]Alright, there goes another one.
[58:42.93]There's only two left, right?
[58:48.17]Yep, okay.
[58:50.26]Are they both magic users?
[59:01.18]Oh, shit.
[59:04.72]Oh, fucking goddamn.
[59:06.18]How many kings are there?
[59:08.84]This is... Oh, fuck.
[59:14.18]No, don't you dare...
[59:20.17]Fucking god, I gotta get away from him.
[59:23.39]I Can't tell how what this how many Kings are there?
[59:26.71]I killed two Kings already.
[59:27.95]Oh shit.
[59:32.29]I Already killed two of these Kings.
[59:34.18]Why are there more Kings?
[59:38.66]Oh This thing that never ends get it away from me, how do I make it stop I
[59:47.47]Good, it stopped.
[59:49.93]They just keep spawning, huh?
[59:55.13]Fucking Jesus.
[59:58.47]He's gonna explode!
[60:02.01]This is fucking calamity.
[60:04.30]There's too many of them.
[60:06.62]There's too many kings.
[60:10.72]Oh my god, there's too many kings.
[60:15.36]Alright, this one's isolated.
[60:24.09]Die!
[60:24.49]Oh my god, Jesus Christ, okay.
[60:33.64]Well, okay, now I understand.
[60:37.04]There's not just four kings.
[60:39.36]Okay, that's bullshit.
[60:40.88]There's a hundred kings.
[60:42.20]They never stop spawning.
[60:43.72]So what you have to do is you gotta kill them immediately when they come out.
[60:47.40]You can't go for the other ones.
[60:49.07]I thought they were four kings!
[60:51.43]Not all kings.
[60:55.88]And, you know what?
[60:56.54]Fuck it.
[60:57.10]I'm... No, I'm gonna keep this weapon.
[61:00.56]Keep this weapon on.
[61:01.12]Yeah, I got overwhelmed.
[61:07.39]Five kings spawned in the four kings boss fight.
[61:14.95]Don't ask me what, like, sharing that throne is like.
[61:16.85]Jesus Christ.
[61:25.97]Yeah, so you got to kill them quick.
[61:30.09]This is not a fight where you got to run around or dodge because they'll just keep spawning.
[61:44.16]They play musical chairs, but I'm going to send this back up.
[61:48.12]All right, let's do this again.
[61:51.12]I get it now.
[61:53.91]I probably would have had it, too.
[61:54.81]I just didn't understand the fight.
[61:57.83]That was a possible first try, but that's... That seems like a fairly difficult first try.
[62:04.68]That's not just like a straight up dodge the boss and fight him.
[62:07.08]There's another mechanic at play there.
[62:13.80]Get more Estus.
[62:14.51]I don't think I'll need it.
[62:17.45]I'm pretty sure... I think I'll be able to do this this time.
[62:20.87]As long as I can do this correctly and time everything right.
[62:30.70]This is the better way to run.
[62:31.56]Watch out for this stupid thing.
[62:41.55]I can see myself getting screwed over right there so bad.
[62:49.02]I'll bump into that guy a few times.
[62:53.05]Like that.
[62:53.45]See, that guy even came through.
[62:54.85]That's bullshit.
[62:55.77]What's with this video game?
[62:57.90]Okay, honestly, they're not supposed to be able to do that.
[62:59.40]They're not supposed to be able to come through here.
[63:08.06]Can you... Wait, I can just jump?
[63:10.51]Oh, okay.
[63:11.21]That's true.
[63:12.15]They're my souls.
[63:13.71]Okay.
[63:15.53]Don't stand around.
[63:16.55]Where is he?
[63:18.23]Where is he?
[63:18.91]Find him.
[63:20.72]There he is.
[63:22.86]Of course, he's all the way back here.
[63:26.88]What do I do about this?
[63:27.72]Can I just block it?
[63:29.72]The stupid, like, spin wheel thing that he does.
[63:31.63]Oh, fuck me.
[63:33.85]Where is it?
[63:34.15]Okay, he just, like, he just, like, queued up moves on me.
[63:37.83]I'm gonna die.
[63:55.13]Watch that.
[63:55.69]Watch it.
[63:56.09]Watch it.
[63:56.48]Watch it.
[63:56.80]He's gotta go!
[63:57.50]He's gotta go!
[63:58.52]Okay, he's dead.
[64:04.74]Oh shit.
[64:05.28]Oh fuck.
[64:05.82]Oh shit!
[64:11.96]No, don't run away from me.
[64:15.22]Fucking stupid thing.
[64:22.82]Right in front of him.
[64:23.32]What an idiot.
[64:24.62]I might as well just eat it.
[64:25.61]Seriously.
[64:34.33]He's gonna die.
[64:35.00]No!
[64:35.22]Where's the other one?
[64:39.72]Over here?
[64:41.54]Why is he lower than me?
[64:51.04]Don't even let him.
[64:52.78]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[64:59.90]I'm so paranoid about their health.
[65:01.01]Where's the other one?
[65:04.25]Oh, come on.
[65:05.47]Where is he?
[65:08.21]Where is he?
[65:10.33]Where did he... Where is he?
[65:11.37]Where's this last guy?
[65:16.48]Oh.
[65:19.14]Oh.
[65:22.93]Don't cast the stupid purple thing.
[65:36.54]I'm like so fucking freaking out right now.
[65:42.55]Where's this last guy?
[65:43.79]Hold on, there's another king?
[65:46.29]Okay, this is like the baby king, apparently.
[65:50.93]Where's the final baby king?
[66:02.83]There we go.
[66:11.51]Bequeathed Lord Sol Shard.
[66:33.88]That's a lot of souls.
[66:35.34]Oh, man.
[66:35.76]That's a lot of souls.
[66:40.95]Okay.
[66:47.30]Bonfire lit.
[66:49.26]Sit down here.
[66:50.82]Level up.
[66:51.22]I mean, might as well just do 40, 40, 40.
[66:57.19]All right.
[67:06.55]40-40-40.
[67:10.62]And... I have a lot of shit to break.
[67:22.57]This should get me to 40-40-40 for the last portion of the game.
[67:35.53]Why do you hate my shoes?
[67:36.65]They're fun.
[67:37.27]Alright, I can take the ring off.
[67:41.51]I don't need it anymore, right?
[67:49.06]Um... What do I want instead, though?
[67:56.72]Critical attack, miracles.
[68:01.34]Boost attack while HP is low.
[68:04.65]I don't think I need Havel's Ring on right now.
[68:12.63]Let's keep this on for now.
[68:13.59]Just because I can have super recovery.
[68:15.53]Alright.
[68:20.86]Level up my shoes.
[68:21.70]No, my shoes are staying the same.
[68:23.84]So now... Now I can move on to... Let's just go to Firelink for a little bit.
[68:30.68]I need to talk to Prompt, right?
[68:46.10]Let's level up one more time.
[68:47.58]Because I have... Soul of Manus.
[68:53.94]I'm going to assume that I don't want this because it's going to be... This is probably magic, I would assume, right?
[69:08.26]I don't think I can get anything from this that I want.
[69:15.53]I don't even know why I'm holding on to this still, because I haven't done it yet.
[69:22.51]The boss souls are unique.
[69:24.73]Yeah, but I don't think I'm going to use the item that I would get from it.
[69:26.82]Let's just see how many I can break in all these.
[69:31.60]It's the catalyst in the spell.
[69:34.86]Yeah, I'll break it.
[69:35.52]Who cares?
[69:35.88]I'm not going to use it.
[69:40.66]You were level 40 or 50 when you beat this game.
[69:43.74]How is that even possible?
[69:47.61]From all the things I looked up online, everyone that did their first playthrough of this game ended up at like 80 to 100.
[69:53.27]You were level 40 when you beat the game the first time?
[70:00.20]You were level 40 when you completed this whole game?
[70:16.88]You also did the DLC.
[70:18.00]Yeah, I did the DLC.
[70:19.34]I mean, are you talking about you beat it at level 40, like, after 30 times of playing through the game?
[70:30.28]30 different times?
[70:35.91]I didn't use a bonfire.
[70:44.33]I beat it on my first try.
[70:48.20]Well look I I just don't believe you If you did that's fucking fantastic, I'm really glad to hear that but I with the type of game This is I just I don't know if I can believe that He's calling me a liar No, I'm not calling you a liar, I'm just saying that's that's very that's very impressive to me I
[71:22.89]Alright, let's go.
[71:31.77]I'm ready to do the end game here.
[71:34.65]Let's do end game.
[71:44.87]Bringing out the fucking pinwheel bullshit, I see.
[71:47.07]Let me go here.
[72:02.14]There's one more.
[72:07.04]Wait, is this the guy that died to pinwheel?
[72:08.86]No, it's not.
[72:09.54]You're going to have to find somebody else that did.
[72:10.88]That wasn't me.
[72:13.88]I have a lot of stuff that I just haven't even used.
[72:20.89]Yeah, let's just get rid of this.
[72:22.21]Who cares?
[72:24.37]That should be enough to level up one more time.
[72:26.51]And that will probably be the last.
[72:27.75]This will probably be one of the last times we actually level up.
[72:32.28]Because we're not going to be able to.
[72:34.16]So we got to 40, 40, 40.
[72:36.72]That's where I wanted to be at the end of the game.
[72:39.42]So let's go.
[72:42.80]Let's go do the Duke's Archive.
[72:46.60]Or... I only have two places to go, don't I?
[72:55.73]There's only two areas left, aren't there?
[72:58.85]Or did I miss one area?
[73:04.01]Does it matter what... I'll do Duke's Archives.
[73:10.11]I know where it is.
[73:15.48]That's Anolando.
[73:18.44]Wait, do I have a Duke's Archive bonfire?
[73:25.91]Do I have one I can travel to?
[73:26.95]I don't remember.
[73:27.91]Did I light one?
[73:31.55]I remember I lit one and I turned around and ran backwards, right?
[73:39.35]Do dukes last?
[73:42.83]Alright, well, let's do... Let's do the fire zone, then.
[73:46.79]Now you just have to go to Anolando.
[73:50.99]Let's change it up.
[73:52.37]I've done Anolando like a hundred times.
[73:53.84]Let's go to the fire zone.
[74:00.31]So, let's go Daughter of Chaos, right?
[74:05.15]And then just go down from there.
[74:06.15]Alright.
[74:17.42]So, we'll go down from here.
[74:21.24]Rest at this bonfire.
[74:26.85]Let's do this part of the video game.
[74:40.61]down there uh how do I get there from here can I just can I just walk out where was it am I going the wrong way here how the fuck do I get there wrong way all right well oh there it is yeah I already beat a boss here
[75:07.71]I ran down here and kind of looked around and then said, well, this is way too high, so I turned around and left.
[75:11.83]There we go.
[75:15.39]Okay.
[75:16.99]Demon ruins.
[75:18.69]Let's rest at this bonfire.
[75:22.57]And, uh, as they say, shall we?
[75:31.18]The natural progression of this place seems to be down over here.
[75:41.98]I can go that way.
[75:43.62]You know, I am gonna go that way first.
[75:44.88]Is this gonna kill me?
[75:49.98]God, why did that kill me?
[75:51.40]That wasn't even that far!
[75:53.32]That wasn't even that far!
[75:57.51]Did I just take extra damage because I was skiing or something?
[76:06.45]Thank God I was not stupid enough where I didn't... I'm still glad I clicked on that.
[76:11.73]Yes, I said the word clicked because I'm a moron.
[76:13.67]I touched the bonfire.
[76:14.69]Alright, let's go this way.
[76:24.59]There's the dubstep enemy.
[76:26.79]No, not again!
[76:38.88]Ice skates.
[76:47.67]Is it?
[76:47.91]Hold on.
[76:48.21]Is this for real?
[76:53.05]Why are the enemies so fucking terrible here?
[76:55.15]Like what?
[77:03.90]I think we mentioned, we talked about this before, but this really does feel like somebody's Warcraft 3 custom map.
[77:21.51]I think, just like the last time we were here, it only took about three hits to kill them, so... Oh, Jesus Christ, dude, really?
[77:42.76]Like, it's just three Taurus demons, like this...
[77:54.25]Well, I really hope I don't have to do this every time.
[77:56.09]Oh my god.
[78:19.48]That move really kind of sucks.
[78:22.06]The R2 for the Butcher Knife is really not that great.
[78:25.44]There's an item over here, let me get that.
[78:32.35]First let me fight three of these Taurus Demons at the same time.
[78:35.17]Oh no, I got lucky.
[78:47.19]R2 is a Stagger.
[78:50.16]I can see that.
[78:53.06]Not on these guys, though.
[79:02.45]Okay, item.
[79:11.49]Die.
[79:13.03]All right, let's take a second here.
[79:18.42]Item right here.
[79:22.31]Seems very easy to get to, but that's not true.
[79:25.17]I have to jump this.
[79:33.07]Hold on.
[79:33.43]Let me look and see if this is somewhere I have to fall from.
[79:36.56]I think I'm going to have to fall from there.
[79:40.00]I can't... No, there's no jumping on that.
[79:41.94]I wouldn't even make the jump.
[79:42.84]I would land right in the lava.
[79:43.78]It would be terrible.
[79:44.50]I'm not doing it.
[79:45.06]I have to fall.
[79:50.28]Same thing over here.
[79:51.02]Although this one looks doable.
[79:57.70]That's pretty doable.
[80:00.26]If I were to think.
[80:09.65]Is there nothing over here?
[80:10.43]There's nothing here.
[80:15.83]Hold on.
[80:16.29]Is there really nothing over here?
[80:24.10]What the fuck's the point of this?
[80:37.29]Um... Okay.
[80:42.36]I can't get this stuff.
[80:46.14]Maybe I can.
[80:51.32]Fire resistance.
[80:54.91]There's 19.
[80:55.19]21.
[80:55.25]Okay, there's 29, 32.
[80:56.47]27, 32.
[81:27.84]Oh, fuck!
[81:38.22]Get it!
[81:48.43]I got it!
[81:55.46]What is it?
[81:55.88]Was it an ember?
[81:58.12]So that's how you get the fire weapons.
[81:59.90]Okay.
[82:01.22]Ember for blacksmith weapon.
[82:02.42]Ascension.
[82:04.00]Plus five flame weapon.
[82:05.58]I gotta get this shit off.
[82:09.38]I'm too heavy now.
[82:16.81]I kind of like this thing.
[82:22.95]That's not that heavy either.
[82:24.69]We'll keep it on.
[82:27.83]So I need to stay under, like, 26-ish.
[82:33.29]So that has to come off.
[82:43.02]32.
[82:44.20]These come off.
[82:44.92]29.
[82:45.66]What about just fire resistance?
[82:47.18]I mean, this has 49 fire resistance.
[82:49.51]Might as well put it on.
[82:51.21]No, I'm mid-rolling still.
[82:54.15]Um...
[83:03.16]Get over here.
[83:05.82]My poise is bad?
[83:07.54]That's fine.
[83:08.00]I don't need it here right now.
[83:10.54]Um, what do I need to be under?
[83:11.78]24, 20, like, 3.
[83:12.43]Come out.
[83:12.85]20, like, 3.
[83:13.51]22-ish.
[83:13.79]23.6.
[83:13.81]No, I don't want to put that thing on.
[83:19.89]Let's go back to the mask of the mother.
[83:31.81]And let's put on... I have to change this, unfortunately.
[83:38.95]19... 20!
[83:38.99]Hey, shadow garb!
[83:40.83]That's fine.
[83:41.31]Whatever.
[83:42.15]What?
[83:42.31]Okay, I was gonna say, how's that possible?
[83:44.03]Alright, let's go.
[83:47.52]Havel's Ring?
[83:49.10]No, I want the stamina.
[83:52.02]I don't need Havel's Ring right now.
[83:57.86]Oh, fuck.
[83:58.42]I have to kindle this bonfire.
[84:02.38]Hold on.
[84:07.04]Yeah, the stamina recovery you get from the ring.
[84:09.74]Let me kindle this.
[84:10.52]It doesn't stack?
[84:12.81]Does it not stack?
[84:16.27]Oh, I think it would.
[84:25.56]It does stack.
[84:26.10]Okay, well, then here you go.
[84:33.50]It only stacks in Dark Souls 2 and 3.
[84:39.22]It feels like it does.
[84:40.36]Alright, let's go.
[84:51.85]Okay, down we go.
[84:56.83]They do stack.
[84:57.45]Okay, well, that's fine.
[85:01.35]So, no reason to go that way unless I want to get the item.
[85:04.89]So, we're going to go the other way.
[85:11.10]What the fuck?
[85:14.86]That was not even... That was just, like, jokey.
[85:18.20]I didn't even... Oh, God.
[85:19.55]Oh, yeah, this part where they just throw, like, 25 capper demons at you.
[85:29.61]I did not do the archives.
[85:31.47]These are the only two places I have not done in the whole game.
[85:33.67]I've done all the DLC.
[85:35.75]We're finishing the game here.
[85:37.24]Alright, that's better than last time.
[85:45.14]It was three swings last time.
[85:46.48]Now it's two, so it's not as much of a pain in the ass.
[85:49.60]Oh, and Ash Lake.
[85:50.38]I did Ash Lake too.
[85:56.04]So this is pretty much the only thing left.
[86:00.34]bar any thing I missed.
[86:04.50]But again, if you're just joining us, if you don't know this, I'm doing like a slow first time ever playing through Dark Souls run.
[86:12.74]I've never beaten this game before.
[86:14.18]And here comes an invasion because I was stupid enough to drink humanity.
[86:20.35]Where is he?
[86:23.75]Come on, Kirk.
[86:24.97]Where is Kirk?
[86:25.79]There he is.
[86:26.35]Hi, Kirk.
[86:34.18]You're dead.
[86:36.05]See ya.
[86:42.05]Humanity acquired and barbed straight sword.
[86:44.81]What a mess.
[86:58.58]Like seriously, what a fucking mess.
[87:14.98]Barbed tip.
[87:16.06]That's right.
[87:19.62]One at a time.
[87:22.70]Jesus Christ.
[87:28.80]I'm pulling you.
[87:29.52]I'm not getting three people aggroed on me right now.
[87:32.15]No way.
[87:35.83]What was that turnaround?
[87:36.87]What the hell was that?
[87:43.27]Is this Dark Souls 2 or is this Dark Souls 1?
[87:46.67]That was my biggest complaint from Dark Souls 2, is your character is a magnet for every swing.
[87:59.66]I guess this is a time I could put on throwing knives, if I really wanted to, right?
[88:08.98]Really?
[88:09.70]Well, that was a nice dodge.
[88:10.64]I'll give it to you.
[88:20.04]Ah.
[88:24.07]Yeah, the Hide Knights.
[88:25.89]Oh, I've never wanted to pull my hair out of its socket after fighting the Hide Knights.
[88:29.51]Their infinite aggro range.
[88:32.49]Those things were horrible.
[88:35.17]They walked across the whole game following you.
[88:39.60]Now, this is where we came to last time.
[88:41.68]And then I turned around because there's a big scary guy here.
[88:43.58]And I was like, don't think so.
[88:45.01]So, let me just explore.
[88:46.13]Oh, yeah.
[88:50.95]These weird, like, stone Slimer enemies.
[88:54.07]I remember these.
[88:54.61]What about items?
[89:02.41]See, like, if I were an item, I would be back here.
[89:05.68]Well, there's another bonfire.
[89:10.40]And now me kindling that last one seems pretty dumb.
[89:16.45]I guess I already lit this.
[89:18.63]Even more dumb.
[89:26.51]You love how they didn't finish this area even in the remaster?
[89:30.38]Yeah, I don't know.
[89:32.48]I mean, I have a feeling about that, but...
[89:38.99]part of me because they did like the dark souls prepare to die edition on pc and that was wasn't that like the re-release of this game wasn't the dark souls prepare to die edition the like quote dark souls remaster for pc that was like all the dlc included and it's on pc
[90:06.97]It was a rebundle, it was a port.
[90:08.43]Yeah, but I feel like that's the opportunity to do, like, a remaster.
[90:11.13]And by remaster, I mean just, like, 60 FPS texture increase.
[90:15.93]That's where it would make sense.
[90:17.25]For, like, the PC port, right?
[90:21.39]So this is the PC port of the PC port.
[90:24.97]This is a remaster of the PC port.
[90:27.61]Or something.
[90:29.34]But it wasn't.
[90:29.98]Yeah.
[90:40.83]Okay.
[90:42.19]What the hell is that?
[90:43.89]Well, alright.
[90:44.47]There's like giant grubs in this area.
[90:47.06]Cool.
[90:48.60]More TARS demons.
[90:49.94]What about the giant grub?
[90:55.84]Ow.
[91:00.55]Okay.
[91:04.17]I can go up there.
[91:06.19]Can I though?
[91:06.71]No.
[91:08.65]So there's fog gate or there's left?
[91:12.57]Alright, let me go up here first.
[91:15.88]I got a bonfire right there, so it's not like it's going to be a pain in the ass to get back to.
[91:23.48]Hello.
[91:23.76]Pick up the item.
[91:34.10]It's the soul of a brave warrior.
[91:38.04]Nothing else here.
[91:42.71]Nope.
[91:44.17]Oh, watch out for the rock slimers.
[91:48.37]Just for the sake of exploration and seeing things, we're going to go to the left, past this Taurus demon.
[91:53.85]Let's see what else is over here.
[91:57.96]Uh, or not.
[92:04.46]I think we have to go down.
[92:06.42]Oh, he's going left?
[92:10.90]Are you serious, dude?
[92:13.22]Ow.
[92:22.21]These guys drop a lot of souls, too.
[92:29.71]You could just farm this area, couldn't you?
[92:31.43]If you really wanted to.
[92:33.21]These guys drop like 1,200 souls each.
[92:43.77]I gotta be careful here.
[92:44.67]This is a death opportunity.
[92:46.01]I thought he was gonna walk off.
[92:51.50]Alright, we're good.
[93:00.10]Why farm when you can just do a dupe glitch?
[93:03.42]I don't know.
[93:03.94]I guess that's true.
[93:04.60]Hello.
[93:10.75]Hello.
[93:15.01]God damn it.
[93:19.28]Whoa.
[93:20.12]Easy.
[93:23.22]Don't die to the stupid fucking worm that jumps down.
[93:26.38]You're gonna die to the worm, aren't you?
[93:27.48]You're gonna die to the fucking worm, aren't you?
[93:38.39]Okay.
[93:40.21]That's probably gonna happen again.
[93:44.47]If I were to take a wild guess, it's going to happen right now.
[93:50.70]Oh, Jesus.
[93:54.18]Oh, my God.
[93:54.98]Oh, my God.
[93:55.70]That was unexpected.
[94:04.80]I thought it was going to be, like, one.
[94:06.00]Oh, shoot the corrosive liquid at me.
[94:19.60]Great.
[94:20.40]Where am I?
[94:20.84]Okay, don't you fucking dare do it here.
[94:28.12]My weapon's broken?
[94:41.85]Little dodge.
[94:42.59]I don't know where I am, but I'm kill- Weapon's at risk.
[94:45.51]All right.
[94:45.93]Well, the weapon's broken.
[94:51.27]And... I don't know which way.
[94:53.09]Is this a mimic?
[94:55.97]I can't tell which way the chain is going.
[94:57.71]It looks like it's coming out.
[94:58.73]Okay, not a mimic.
[95:16.88]Large flame ember.
[95:18.12]All right.
[95:20.44]So we got all the items that are here besides the one that's back there.
[95:23.18]I need to go back.
[95:23.96]My weapon's broken, so... I could just use this for a little bit, but... Bonfire is right there.
[95:34.85]But I have to go through all the fucking enemies again.
[95:37.62]Do I even have any repair powder?
[95:40.60]I don't think I even have one.
[95:42.74]I definitely don't.
[95:43.64]I'm almost certain of that.
[95:51.40]No, I don't.
[95:51.92]Although, I don't know why these aren't on.
[95:56.56]These should be on.
[96:08.23]Yeah, I have to go to the bonfire.
[96:09.75]And there's an item back there that I missed, so I'm going to go get it.
[96:13.45]Yeah, I have the repair module at the bonfire.
[96:24.03]I can use the Lloyd Talisman to reveal mimics.
[96:26.87]That's cool.
[96:28.45]I did not know that.
[96:29.91]Thank you for the information.
[96:38.30]That was a lot of Green Titanite.
[96:41.68]It looks like I'm falling off this.
[96:43.02]That looked like I fell off like three times.
[96:44.44]All right.
[96:45.74]Bonfire.
[96:46.77]Repair.
[96:56.91]all right um I don't have to level up here should I just put it into like resistance because I'm already like I'm already capped here I don't want to go any further I don't think should I put it into like resistance or like endurance never resistance just put it just get 50 strength yeah
[97:29.39]Okay.
[97:30.01]Oh, I just... Well, there goes all my repair equipment.
[97:37.17]I'm going to repair it, though.
[97:40.87]Is this stuff broken, too?
[97:42.88]Do these even have durability?
[97:51.70]Yeah, they do.
[97:52.12]These things are broken, too.
[97:53.38]Alright, well, let me just crack one of those eggs open.
[98:03.99]Repair it all.
[98:07.59]Uh, repair the great sword.
[98:08.93]Repair for two souls.
[98:10.31]I was like, wait a minute.
[98:15.38]Um... Shit's broken.
[98:23.94]Okay, like... Xbox One, your controller, really makes me want to eat poison.
[98:31.35]This D-pad, the whole D-pad is one button.
[98:38.57]That's fine.
[98:39.07]That's currently what I'm wearing.
[98:40.05]Wait, what about this?
[98:45.39]Alright.
[98:47.31]It's time to continue.
[98:48.97]We're going to go in the fog gate.
[98:49.99]I feel like I'm fairly close to something here.
[98:57.23]Don't walk off the edge.
[98:58.13]Let's go.
[99:00.86]Again with the controller.
[99:01.92]Well, it's just the D-pad.
[99:02.88]The D-pad is a giant button.
[99:04.32]So sometimes when you press left on the D-pad, it presses every single D-pad button.
[99:10.51]It's really, really great.
[99:23.50]Well, we got through that.
[99:26.77]Anything else up here?
[99:27.57]A little too late to look, but what's that?
[99:30.75]Oh, there's a, oh, there's that.
[99:32.31]Something there.
[99:32.83]Let's hold on.
[99:33.63]Shiny item.
[99:35.91]Wait, no!
[99:36.63]Wait, I can fall off this.
[99:37.65]Hold on.
[99:42.50]All right, where the hell am I now?
[99:50.96]It's a little brave warrior.
[99:53.92]Is this, is this by Nito?
[99:57.00]I guess I could go down there.
[99:57.82]Okay, I could go down.
[100:03.78]Let's go all the way to the end here.
[100:14.23]Huh.
[100:19.42]I think this kills me.
[100:24.37]Yeah, that kills me probably.
[100:26.57]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[100:27.87]Illusion wall or something?
[100:34.97]I'm going to die if I fall off this, guys.
[100:36.53]We have to go from over here.
[100:41.33]Very clearly, the stairs go up, so I won't die from this one.
[100:50.92]Alright.
[100:51.80]So, here we are.
[101:01.05]Just twigs and branches.
[101:06.09]Can I cut through them?
[101:07.41]Can I cut through these?
[101:09.33]Can I walk by this?
[101:11.73]No.
[101:12.15]That is the end of the road here.
[101:13.15]So we have to go there.
[101:17.62]How am I alive?
[101:18.36]I don't know.
[101:22.86]But this is new.
[101:26.38]There are like scorpion monsters here.
[101:32.70]These things seem pretty harmless.
[101:36.68]And a big door.
[101:37.28]There's something back there getting hurt.
[101:41.73]Alright, I ain't gonna open this door and a giant wave of water is not gonna hit me in the face, right?
[101:49.15]Oh, it's locked.
[101:53.71]I can't even do anything about it.
[101:56.75]Well, never mind.
[102:07.81]Well, back to the Fog Gate, which will probably end up being a boss, which, you know, you know, we should be pretty prepared for.
[102:24.26]There are all those enemies there, though, so we're gonna go right through it.
[102:27.30]Okay.
[102:31.14]Demon Firesage.
[102:32.88]There he is!
[102:33.60]Hello, boss!
[102:36.77]Ow.
[102:40.14]Well, now it would be a good idea to use fire resistance.
[102:44.40]Hold on.
[102:44.96]Get these fucking trees out of the way.
[102:47.36]I can't even see myself think.
[102:52.11]It's just the tutorial boss on fire.
[102:56.87]No, this is a stray demon, too.
[102:58.73]They've used this boss three times.
[103:01.05]Alright, I need to stop talking and fight the fucking tutorial boss.
[103:14.03]He does like the little explosion thing.
[103:15.39]Oh, he's got a lot of health.
[103:19.15]Alright, let's fight this guy.
[103:20.35]What do we got?
[103:36.20]Big butt drop.
[103:37.15]Nope, he's going to swing back and forth.
[103:46.61]Yep Mm-hmm do the big swing and have the explosion happen if you so please All right, and for the third time let's kill the tutorial boss I
[104:19.80]I mean, they didn't even try with that one.
[104:24.64]That was just... They just took the tutorial boss?
[104:29.02]No, that was just the stray demon.
[104:31.25]If you want to copy a boss, two is alright.
[104:32.95]But three... Three is pushing it a little bit here.
[104:41.41]But it's alright.
[104:42.90]Sometimes you're going to get clones.
[104:44.94]That's fine.
[104:46.52]Let's keep going.
[104:51.12]But this time he was on fire.
[104:52.64]Yeah.
[104:56.87]God of War had the same troll boss like ten times?
[105:00.53]Did it really?
[105:07.51]Better than seven serpents.
[105:08.87]How dare you say something like that?
[105:12.23]How dare you say such a painfully untrue statement?
[105:17.67]Alright, let's go down.
[105:19.64]We can go up or down.
[105:20.70]Down, there's another door here.
[105:21.96]And there is a bonfire.
[105:26.30]Let's just light it.
[105:33.37]Um, I'm going to kindle this just because it's right here.
[105:37.83]Why not?
[105:38.71]I only need to use one humanity anyways.
[105:46.80]I'm not even going to stream God of War.
[105:48.02]You know, I've thought about it.
[105:55.57]I have thought about streaming God of War.
[105:57.43]I probably will, but not right now.
[106:00.43]Not this second, you know.
[106:03.32]I don't really have enough to do this, so that's not going to be enough.
[106:07.48]I'm not going to crush smog.
[106:12.04]Sanctuary, Guardian.
[106:13.04]I don't think I'm ever going to use this.
[106:18.58]Through the old God of Wars?
[106:32.39]No, I can't do it.
[106:33.73]There's nothing really I can do.
[106:40.93]Where... Okay, if I crush... This is going to be so sad.
[106:43.74]If I crush this and use this and I can't level up to 42 strength.
[106:48.38]I'm going to do it, though.
[106:49.04]Let's see.
[106:49.92]You know, I don't want to... 24,000.
[106:51.54]That's enough to want to try and do it.
[106:53.50]It's not going to happen, is it?
[106:58.60]Guardian soul, goodbye.
[107:03.22]I'm not going to pop smogs.
[107:04.50]I need to see the cartoon hammer.
[107:06.52]Even for PvP, I want to PvP with that.
[107:10.19]Guardian Soul Sealing.
[107:15.81]I'm already a demigod.
[107:17.15]Stop leveling.
[107:20.05]Shit!
[107:21.75]Shit!
[107:22.73]God damn it.
[107:23.25]I gotta go kill some of the monkeys up here.
[107:25.09]Whatever they are.
[107:25.55]What are they?
[107:28.99]I said the Wizard of Oz monkeys already, but that's what's up here.
[107:44.57]My max level that I'm allowing myself to be is... I'm not going to go past 90.
[108:01.22]Why?
[108:01.48]Because I like the number 90.
[108:03.64]I just feel like it's not 100, it's 90.
[108:06.56]It's cleaner, it's nicer looking.
[108:09.32]I don't want 100 on a test, I'd rather take an A-.
[108:15.78]Alright, I need to just kill like two more of these guys.
[108:17.54]Come here.
[108:27.24]Come here.
[108:29.46]Oh my god, those guys do a lot of damage.
[108:36.53]It's because it's all fire.
[108:37.55]You don't do anything else.
[108:43.29]Don't do the corrosive shit on me again, please.
[108:44.91]Alright, what do I need?
[108:45.90]44.
[108:47.28]Alright, I need one more for the road, so let's just kill this guy.
[108:58.48]Alright.
[108:59.92]42 strength.
[109:06.12]I can't get 100 on a test?
[109:07.20]No, I don't want to be a soul level 100.
[109:12.54]So level 90, I think, is like a clean way to have like an end game character.
[109:21.20]Nothing over here.
[109:21.94]Nice and clean.
[109:40.66]That's enough.
[109:41.58]Let's go.
[109:46.21]120 is the optimal level.
[109:51.39]What is... Alright.
[109:52.49]What is the actual... Like, no bullshit.
[109:54.89]Don't feed me any horse shit here.
[109:56.75]What is the actual soul level that most people are or should be by the time you are at... After doing all the DLC and being at Gwyn?
[110:05.34]What is like the... What is it?
[110:09.16]All the DLC and... Get to Gwyn.
[110:15.39]It is 90.
[110:21.22]120 is the community agreed PvP.
[110:22.64]70 to 125.
[110:22.74]80 to 120.
[110:22.84]90 to... Okay.
[110:23.22]80 to 100.
[110:23.56]Alright, so I'm right there then.
[110:26.31]Alright.
[110:26.53]87.
[110:26.55]You can't ask a serious question.
[110:27.49]Yes, you can.
[110:27.87]Alright, let's go down into the fog gate.
[110:48.92]More tree shit.
[110:49.62]All right.
[110:50.10]Well, hold on.
[110:50.62]What's this?
[110:56.08]Just a soul.
[110:57.13]Okay.
[111:00.03]Did I just kill myself here?
[111:02.33]I think I might have just died.
[111:06.75]I think I died.
[111:07.79]No, not yet.
[111:13.31]Still alive.
[111:13.78]Okay.
[111:16.16]There is a summoning sign here.
[111:19.09]For... I can summon... I can summon Solaire here.
[111:24.63]For what?
[111:24.99]This is a boss?
[111:26.65]Wait, they do back-to-back bosses.
[111:30.08]Do it.
[111:31.78]No, I don't want to do any multiplayer, like, co-op bosses.
[111:34.58]I want to do them all by myself.
[111:43.07]Alright.
[111:44.81]Boss time.
[111:58.65]What is it, a centipede?
[112:00.00]Centipede demon?
[112:04.12]Centipede butthole demon.
[112:05.28]Alright, cool.
[112:19.30]Centipede.
[112:21.04]It is a centipede.
[112:23.10]Can I not walk on this fire?
[112:25.49]Oh my god, this is impossible.
[112:27.31]I can't do this.
[112:28.47]I don't think this is possible to beat this guy right now.
[112:30.85]I need to come back here later with like the Zelda shoes.
[112:33.32]Wait a minute, hold on.
[112:45.04]I'm gonna fight him over here.
[112:51.47]Will he come over here?
[112:54.32]I'm like, is this a bad idea?
[112:56.40]This is the only thing I can think of, is like this spot right here, right now.
[113:05.26]Ow.
[113:05.82]Okay, so he explodes when he punches?
[113:10.85]He looks like Carnage.
[113:12.47]I like him already.
[113:15.33]Oh, please.
[113:16.83]Okay, I gotta go left or right.
[113:20.01]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[113:31.70]Jesus Christ, that takes a little getting used to.
[113:35.47]Let me just fucking hurt him, please.
[113:43.54]You're not so tough.
[113:48.66]Why'd I do that?
[114:11.30]Yeah, you're fucking easy.
[114:12.26]Get out of here.
[114:17.10]What are you, some kind of easy guy?
[114:18.41]That actually could have gone really, really wrong.
[114:31.00]Alright, here's another question.
[114:32.20]I have a question for you guys as well.
[114:36.06]Question one.
[114:39.44]Did I do the game backwards?
[114:44.33]Was I in New Londo?
[114:47.03]Did I do the game incorrectly?
[114:52.33]No.
[114:52.55]So I'm supposed to be here right now.
[114:55.81]Okay.
[114:55.98]Okay.
[114:57.98]I'm going to assume that ring is... Hey, guess what?
[115:00.02]You can walk through fire now.
[115:05.48]Reduce lava damage.
[115:06.40]There it is.
[115:10.18]How much does it reduce it?
[115:12.56]Oh, that's great.
[115:13.16]I could walk around in this all day.
[115:16.66]This is awesome.
[115:21.11]He read a guide?
[115:22.27]No, I didn't read a guide.
[115:28.60]The only thing I ever knew about this game was two things.
[115:33.57]I've seen bosses killed on speedruns.
[115:38.31]Although I've never seen this boss before.
[115:41.67]I've seen like the any% Dark Souls 1 speedrun.
[115:44.85]I've like in the background like AGDQ eating like pizza like on the TV while I'm like reading a book.
[115:53.02]So I mean that's all I know.
[115:54.34]Is there anything else in here?
[116:05.03]Super multi-tasking.
[116:07.53]I guess we can go through here.
[116:11.65]Although, I want to go up.
[116:13.84]Am I going to be in a new area?
[116:20.62]Oh, shit.
[116:20.94]There he is.
[116:21.30]Hello, Solaire.
[116:35.06]Why?
[116:36.72]Why?
[116:38.16]After all this searching, I still cannot find it.
[116:43.34]What is he looking for?
[116:45.90]Why?
[116:47.56]Why?
[116:49.02]After all... What are you looking for, man?
[116:55.88]Wait, will this make you happy?
[116:59.86]No, no, wrong one.
[117:02.12]Where is it?
[117:03.48]Hold on.
[117:07.76]There it is.
[117:08.42]Praise the sun.
[117:10.44]Praise the sun.
[117:15.90]He didn't like that.
[117:24.55]I don't think I can do anything else.
[117:30.33]Although I need to... I'm getting so many fucking souls down here.
[117:37.01]the boss rush area it's like all right 88 uh keep that ring on I want to go explore there's a lot of things to look at here hold on this goes back because this is the area where I fought the boss hold on I I want to look up
[118:10.64]I could go up, I could go down, and we went down.
[118:12.62]I want to go up.
[118:17.64]Call Solaire.
[118:18.40]He's crying.
[118:20.92]He's going to be crying for a long time because I ain't calling him.
[118:27.63]I almost just fell off.
[118:31.75]This also has 10, so I might as well just get it.
[118:41.31]So that was like three bosses in a row.
[118:45.49]Interesting.
[118:46.29]Alright, let's go up.
[118:52.81]Reduce fire damage.
[118:53.61]Look at that.
[118:53.94]I'm just testing to see how it worked.
[118:58.80]Okay.
[119:06.12]I made that ring.
[119:07.60]Did you really?
[119:08.14]Holy shit, man.
[119:09.24]That's pretty sick.
[119:14.13]Did you make any other rings in the game?
[119:16.81]What other rings did you make?
[119:27.75]This just keeps going up.
[119:30.31]That kind of enemy?
[119:36.92]You made the Lord of the Ring.
[119:39.65]Oh, well, that's a... Hold on.
[119:41.17]Wait a minute.
[119:41.79]I don't want to go up there yet.
[119:43.41]That's a shortcut down here, but where does it go?
[119:46.89]Oh, no.
[119:47.33]What have I done?
[119:51.56]Oh, no.
[119:57.34]Has it come back?
[119:58.00]Thank God.
[119:58.42]Okay.
[119:59.22]Hold on.
[120:01.12]What is down here?
[120:01.66]Okay, that's the front door.
[120:07.33]So this goes up, and this is a...
[120:11.88]This must just be a shortcut down here.
[120:13.36]What, does it go to Firelink or something?
[120:14.78]If this goes to Firelink, then this game gets an extra letter grid.
[120:21.67]Oh, now it comes here.
[120:24.11]Okay, well that makes sense.
[120:32.15]So you could just go to that bonfire and this is an easier run.
[120:34.55]Okay, I get it.
[120:38.13]Well, we don't need this anymore, so I just want to know what was up here.
[120:46.24]Hey, that's pretty neat.
[120:47.14]Yeah, it is.
[120:55.73]Can't just roll off.
[120:57.27]What kind of video game have you made here?
[121:04.20]All right.
[121:09.90]Let's go.
[121:24.70]It's alright.
[121:25.10]I can just jump off the whole thing.
[121:28.13]No.
[121:28.61]I'm stuck here.
[121:31.21]One jump.
[121:31.73]One hurdle.
[121:32.91]Two hurdles.
[121:36.15]Alright.
[121:37.05]That's pretty bold.
[121:38.01]That's pretty bold.
[121:47.45]Where was it?
[121:48.59]Hold on.
[121:50.77]What have I done?
[121:54.26]Is it this way?
[121:54.97]Where the fuck am I going?
[121:56.51]Yeah, it's this way.
[121:58.41]What am I doing?
[122:00.11]What am I doing right now?
[122:02.55]This is the boss room and I go left?
[122:04.69]What have I done?
[122:08.42]There's another way to go down, right?
[122:13.98]What have I done?
[122:19.37]I'm having so much trouble remembering.
[122:21.77]This is...
[122:26.33]Was it over here?
[122:27.17]Oh, it's right over here.
[122:31.11]It's here.
[122:31.45]Okay.
[122:33.01]Right?
[122:41.75]Yeah, it's right here.
[122:42.47]Okay.
[122:44.83]Whatever.
[122:45.13]Alright, you ever just want to attach a drill bit to a drill and stick it in your back and hold the button down because your back hurts so much?
[122:59.37]I don't know what's going on, man.
[123:00.55]I gotta go to the doctor.
[123:01.47]This is bad.
[123:04.11]I swear to God, if I have like a kidney problem or something, just add to more fucking shit I have to deal with.
[123:14.06]All right.
[123:15.74]So I can go over here.
[123:20.10]No, that's not a liver problem.
[123:21.18]Liver problem, you'd feel your, if you had liver pain, it'd be in the front of your like abdomen, top right part of your abdomen.
[123:27.15]What the fuck is all this?
[123:31.09]Hold on.
[123:34.89]Have I been moving boxes around?
[123:37.30]No, not really.
[123:39.74]Not anything that's that heavy.
[123:43.00]Is this pointless over here?
[123:44.06]It looks like it's pointless.
[123:54.21]Do this do physical therapy?
[123:55.19]Yeah, but I just want to make sure it's not like a kidney problem.
[123:58.87]Because that's kidney pain.
[124:01.54]That kind of right to the left of the spine.
[124:05.20]One side.
[124:06.84]Deep.
[124:08.22]I get it sometimes.
[124:09.14]I don't think I've ever been tested for a kidney problem.
[124:15.02]Lost Izalith.
[124:22.74]I can't even tell.
[124:23.82]Are those dragons?
[124:30.52]Um, okay.
[124:38.44]Let's go over here.
[124:41.68]I can just walk on the fire, though, so.
[124:43.83]These guys, are they just set pieces, or do they fight?
[124:55.73]I just want to get the fucking item.
[124:59.94]Okay.
[125:08.68]Why are there so many of them?
[125:10.50]There's like a fucking hundred of them.
[125:22.63]Stay on the perimeter for now.
[125:40.31]Where did he go?
[125:40.99]Is he dead?
[125:41.47]Oh, I don't know how much of this I can take.
[125:46.89]This loud ass noise.
[125:48.51]Oh my god.
[126:00.83]What is this place?
[126:03.17]This is like... This is dumb.
[126:10.12]Alright, uh, there's an item over here.
[126:14.57]Uh, there's a chest here.
[126:19.95]Okay, I'll take the item.
[126:23.42]Soul of a great hero.
[126:29.76]What the hell?
[126:30.88]Oh, it's you.
[126:41.91]Okay.
[126:45.41]I don't even need to fight these things, then.
[126:47.63]Just go?
[126:49.11]Where to, though?
[126:49.89]Like, into the big house?
[126:55.23]Are they hurting each other?
[126:56.11]Or are they killing each other?
[127:02.84]Wait a minute.
[127:04.02]They can kill each other.
[127:18.64]Oh shit.
[127:21.41]Fight.
[127:23.21]Fight my minions.
[127:30.59]Oh no, they're jumping up in the air like frogs.
[127:32.55]He's gonna squash them.
[127:38.42]Get out of the way.
[127:44.02]One's dead.
[127:44.48]There's another one.
[127:46.05]He's dead.
[127:51.19]Alright, let's just go.
[127:52.53]I'm assuming I gotta go up this way.
[128:00.22]Like, up there?
[128:07.86]Wait, no, this is where I came from.
[128:12.19]But there was an item over here.
[128:13.41]No, I didn't come from here.
[128:27.05]Twin humanities.
[128:27.87]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[128:30.79]No, this is not an illusion?
[128:55.50]One of these has to be an illusion, right?
[128:57.71]Of course it is.
[128:58.65]And there's a bonfire in here.
[128:59.67]I was going to say, why would this be closed?
[129:08.79]There's no reason for this to be closed.
[129:09.97]Alright, let's kindle while we're here.
[129:21.69]I'm a cheater.
[129:22.41]Why am I a cheater?
[129:32.21]I read the Nintendo Power.
[129:37.05]I did not read the Nintendo Power.
[129:38.61]He hasn't died in like an hour.
[129:39.91]I haven't really had an opportunity to.
[129:43.21]It's been a lot of just... It's been like two or three bosses in a row that were just strange and not really that difficult, but just odd.
[129:52.45]Alright, let's go from here.
[129:53.55]I have no idea what's going on.
[130:04.47]I don't even know what direction I came from.
[130:08.15]This way?
[130:26.69]That was a humble brag.
[130:27.99]No, it wasn't.
[130:29.31]I didn't say that.
[130:29.95]I just said they were odd.
[130:34.18]These aren't even dragons, these are just oversized chickens that stomp in the air.
[130:49.63]Okay, um, I'm just gonna walk around until I find something.
[131:04.97]There's another item over here.
[131:11.48]Oh, my God.
[131:14.14]Oh, my God.
[131:15.02]Somebody said, when was the last time he died?
[131:16.66]Well, not yet.
[131:24.33]There was an item over here.
[131:25.27]It's over here.
[131:28.98]How do I get over there?
[131:29.80]There's two items over there.
[131:31.32]How do I get over there?
[131:47.38]Okay, divine blessing that's full of heal and to the okay, that's pretty cool.
[132:01.60]I guess why is my armor at risk?
[132:08.07]These guys break your armor
[132:12.53]Or is it the fire that I'm standing in?
[132:14.37]It might have something to do with the armor.
[132:18.41]My clothes are burning.
[132:21.91]Alright, there's the bonfire, and there's the twig, and then over this way, and then... I don't know.
[132:26.51]There's too many people here.
[132:27.87]Alright, there are too many people here.
[132:32.53]You know what I mean?
[132:37.09]I'm gonna go over here for a second.
[132:38.75]Hold on.
[132:40.80]I need to look.
[132:42.56]I need a vantage point.
[132:46.25]Okay, so there's a... I can go over there.
[132:52.44]What is up that?
[132:54.44]Let me repair.
[132:55.92]And then go that way.
[133:07.80]Where's the entrance there?
[133:08.78]Oh my god, really?
[133:14.39]Where was it?
[133:14.87]Am I even at the right stone structure here?
[133:17.15]Alright.
[133:26.25]Repair equipment.
[133:34.60]It really does burn everything, huh?
[133:38.08]What about the weapon?
[133:38.68]Does it fuck up the weapon too?
[133:42.61]No, not really.
[133:43.61]Don't ask me why I'm doing all this.
[133:45.89]No, you know what?
[133:46.39]Fuck it.
[133:51.85]This fucking Xbox controller is going to make me scream.
[133:55.21]Somebody gave $100.
[133:55.57]Hold on.
[133:55.93]$100.
[133:55.95]$100.
[133:55.97]Hold on a second. $100.
[134:10.75]All right, everything's clean.
[134:12.07]We got a mangled squid.
[134:13.67]Thank you, mangled squid, for the $100.
[134:18.37]Much appreciated, dude.
[134:19.19]And the message is, hey.
[134:23.45]That's it.
[134:25.29]Hey.
[134:26.77]Well, hey to you as well, mangled squid.
[134:32.44]Thank you for the incredibly large monetary donation.
[134:36.18]Hey to you.
[134:37.00]Thank you.
[134:46.36]We're going this way.
[134:47.22]Thanks a lot, man.
[134:49.41]I'm going to spend your $100 on a Dark Souls remastered edition when it comes out in four more years.
[135:03.82]I'm going to buy the collector's edition of the Dark Souls remade version.
[135:15.56]I don't think we've gone this way.
[135:20.20]No, can't cut that.
[135:21.82]Um... Where the fuck am I going?
[135:27.63]Guess we're going over here.
[135:32.15]Right?
[135:32.37]I just got... I got target dummied.
[135:37.19]Yep.
[135:48.99]Nothing else over there.
[135:49.93]What about behind the... No.
[135:51.68]Okay.
[135:52.32]Wait.
[135:54.56]Alright.
[135:55.44]This way.
[135:56.52]There's items up there.
[135:57.78]Hold on.
[135:58.18]My back is like... I just need to pay somebody just to... I'm going to lie down on my stomach and someone's going to just jump and stomp both their heels directly into my spine.
[136:11.57]I will pay somebody to do that.
[136:18.09]I'm gonna, like, lie down on my, like, face forward.
[136:20.73]Somebody's gonna sit on a couch and just, like, toddler tantrum.
[136:25.15]Smash their heels, like, up, up, up, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.
[136:29.74]Just pretend you're kneading me like dough with your heels.
[136:42.86]Or one of those medieval torture racks.
[136:45.22]You know what?
[136:45.66]I would love to be in one of those stretchy machines right now.
[136:54.61]These guys are pointless.
[136:55.49]Why am I even attacking them?
[136:59.79]These guys don't do anything.
[137:01.01]What do these guys do?
[137:03.53]Besides breathe fire and just get in the way.
[137:05.39]Nothing.
[137:10.65]So...
[137:13.38]You've always wanted to do one of those?
[137:17.14]Yeah, I mean, so... Take away, like, the stretching too far, and that's just a relaxation machine, man.
[137:22.30]Alright, this is an enemy I've never seen before.
[137:25.34]Is that those two guns?
[137:26.78]I feel like it's the two cannonballs that are gonna come out.
[137:35.16]Well, that's just a giant nose.
[137:36.74]Alright, okay, I probably should have killed those guys.
[137:38.90]Why is the tree getting in the way?
[137:40.32]It's making... It's impeding my progress!
[137:51.16]Okay.
[137:56.42]Didn't drop anything.
[137:57.14]It looked like there was a way... Oh, whatever.
[138:02.96]No, it's going.
[138:06.04]This is a... No, I thought this was a... Illusion?
[138:11.52]No.
[138:12.98]Not an elevator.
[138:17.00]Inversion therapy?
[138:17.86]Oh, yes.
[138:20.20]I should just get one of those things.
[138:21.36]Those things are so expensive, though.
[138:22.54]I thought those things were like $500 or $600.
[138:37.28]So this might as well get it.
[138:38.42]Just a soul of a hero.
[138:39.48]A lot of souls here.
[138:42.68]Tons of souls.
[138:47.56]Ooh, hold on.
[138:49.54]The one thing that scares me about the inversion machines is it's definitely the fact that I know they like clamp you in, but I have this weird panic mode being upside down, turning upside down and falling on my skull because the thing snaps.
[139:06.35]Hanging upside down by your ankles by a device that's an infomercial device.
[139:12.08]I feel like it would just be like... And I would land directly on my neck and like snap my neck and kick myself.
[139:18.32]My toes would hit the ground behind me.
[139:21.60]That scares the shit out of me.
[139:26.70]Stream it if I get it.
[139:27.94]Who is this guy?
[139:32.88]That was a neat little trick.
[139:36.72]Wait, why is Kirk back?
[139:40.04]Kirk, we already settled this.
[139:42.62]Like, really?
[139:46.03]Kirk, I mean, at this point you're getting a little desperate.
[139:54.09]How many times do I have to kill Kirk before he gives up?
[139:56.13]I got a catalyst.
[140:00.70]27,000 souls, what the fuck?
[140:07.57]And I got his shield, too.
[140:08.74]I have a lot of souls.
[140:13.08]Fuck, man.
[140:13.40]Maybe I should put on one of those rings.
[140:15.08]Okay, well, this is definitely a boss.
[140:21.37]I wonder if there's an easier way to get here.
[140:22.87]Chest.
[140:34.70]It's not a mimic, so just open it.
[140:38.58]pyromancy um all right is there a way to get here quicker probably not I mean that's not that bad of a run I guess or maybe it isn't depending on what this is uh 60 000 souls though I feel like I need to go back
[141:05.84]I could, you know, you know what?
[141:07.32]Fuck it.
[141:08.26]No, I can't use the ring because this is like a fire zone.
[141:37.60]okay where was it it was which side was it on right there I'm not lost again I know where I'm going I know where I'm going I know where I'm going it's right okay from the bonfire it's straight out the door
[142:11.36]I didn't even need to repair.
[142:12.36]What are you guys talking about?
[142:13.38]I didn't even need to do this.
[142:16.79]I'm going to Kindle this again.
[142:17.97]Because I have the humanity.
[142:19.57]Just fucking do it.
[142:27.51]I'm not going to put the lantern on.
[142:37.38]Alright, let's do it.
[142:39.41]I had the extra humanity by killing Kirk again, so might as well get it to 15.
[142:43.97]There's a boss through the door.
[142:48.00]Overkindled?
[142:49.64]That's not overkindled.
[142:51.34]Overfarmed?
[142:52.20]Overleveled?
[142:52.80]I'm not overleveled.
[142:55.56]We already went over this.
[142:56.74]I'm not overleveled.
[142:59.15]Stop saying that.
[143:00.15]The next person that says that... Adios, as they say.
[143:17.92]This run, how far is it?
[143:19.24]It's not that far.
[143:20.16]I guess it is, though.
[143:24.08]Is it that far?
[143:26.04]Yeah, this run does seem kind of far.
[143:28.04]Is there another bonfire?
[143:29.58]It's gonna go up and then down.
[143:38.83]Alright, let's do it.
[143:46.01]Let's fight the boss.
[143:54.41]It's not even a boss.
[143:55.67]In fact, this is a slide.
[143:58.83]It's a slide.
[144:04.00]Okay, I'm ready.
[144:24.46]Let's go!
[144:25.06]All right, here we go.
[144:26.64]Bed of Chaos!
[144:27.40]Ooh, okay, so he's got like willow tree hands.
[144:57.92]So do I hit him in the hands?
[145:05.24]Yeah, great feature of the video game.
[145:13.71]Okay, it's not the hands.
[145:16.57]What?
[145:24.39]Is it like in the face tendrils?
[145:40.14]What does it reach, man?
[145:43.48]Okay, um... Can I climb up?
[145:51.46]Oh, wait a minute.
[145:52.12]Okay, hold on.
[145:54.58]This looks like a please attack me thing, doesn't it?
[145:59.98]Can I go... Alright.
[146:01.26]Do I have to break his, like, tree parts?
[146:14.21]Did I do it?
[146:18.69]What the fuck just happened?
[146:28.02]That's how you release the real boss, right?
[146:33.71]Yeah, he had a parasite in his tree trunk and it comes out, it's gonna be a giant bug.
[146:41.32]Yeah, it's one of those... the ant mind control bugs.
[146:44.16]You know what I'm talking about?
[146:44.98]With the mushrooms that go in their brains.
[146:47.18]Okay, so now I have to fight the actual... Wait, what about this stuff?
[146:55.04]No, alright.
[146:55.74]There's another one, I think.
[146:59.37]Easy.
[147:10.05]So the ground is gone.
[147:10.83]Okay, that's good to know.
[147:12.09]Great.
[147:15.73]Alright.
[147:16.93]That would have been nice to know that.
[147:19.13]Before stepping out.
[147:20.31]Oh, but we get to do the slide again, though.
[147:33.85]Hold on.
[147:34.13]We get to do the slide again.
[147:35.51]That's really important.
[147:49.70]Every time that we die to this boss and I get, like, sad, just know that we're going to be able to do this song on the slide.
[147:57.93]That's making me happy already.
[147:59.89]And it didn't even happen yet.
[148:12.06]Was the song really loud when I played it last time?
[148:14.84]Should I be at, like, 50% volume?
[148:20.42]Are we in emote-only mode?
[148:21.88]What's going on here?
[148:27.29]No, it wasn't.
[148:27.81]Okay.
[148:28.93]Why are we in emote-only?
[148:30.49]What happened?
[148:32.57]Alright, I'm ready to have fun again.
[148:35.85]I'm gonna have a blast right now.
[148:40.09]Okay, here we go!
[149:00.68]Let's go!
[149:20.18]What the fuck?
[149:21.62]Okay, well, that was not fair.
[149:25.12]I would call that not fair.
[149:26.26]If I was a guy playing a video game and
[149:30.06]I am.
[149:31.28]I am all those things that I just said.
[149:32.92]But we get to do the Mario thing again.
[149:36.62]It's alright.
[149:37.04]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[149:53.61]This run is so long.
[150:07.52]Freedom.
[150:08.16]Freedom.
[150:08.72]Freedom.
[150:13.70]Alright.
[150:14.78]As upset as I could, but we're gonna be able to play that song again, so... No, okay.
[150:28.85]Wait, wait, wait.
[150:29.75]That's a good idea.
[150:30.39]Alright, hold on.
[150:30.77]We have to... Hold on a second.
[150:34.99]We have to have at least a couple of songs here.
[150:49.03]okay here we go I'm ready I'm ready we got we got another song queued up here all right you ready I am let's see let's see how many points I can get with my manual
[151:21.22]That's plus 500,000 points!
[151:21.94]Which one is it?
[151:25.86]Which one is it?
[151:27.24]Go, go, go!
[151:28.08]Nope, wrong way.
[151:49.86]Turn the song off.
[151:50.68]Turn off the song.
[151:51.62]It's too loud.
[151:52.12]It's too loud.
[151:52.60]Alright, we're good.
[151:54.48]No, no, no, no.
[152:10.74]Okay, I gotta fucking pay attention to this shit.
[152:19.98]Alright, am I gonna die the most to this fucking boss because I haven't even attempted to fight the boss yet?
[152:57.03]I have to blow up his egg sack.
[153:02.17]And then figure it out.
[153:08.26]Yeah, that's a good one, you're right.
[153:09.70]I was gonna do that one after this one, but that's actually a great one to do.
[153:14.38]Because that makes perfect sense, because that is actually the first level of that game.
[153:22.83]So, yeah.
[153:24.35]I agree.
[153:38.76]No, not Andrew WK.
[153:49.45]I wonder when I'm going to get fucking sick of doing this.
[153:51.39]Alright, hold on.
[154:01.36]Let me get it.
[154:09.47]Okay, I'm ready.
[154:13.66]All right, let's do it with this song.
[154:57.68]I'm never gonna be able to get by this it's never going to happen I'm I'm I beat dark souls one it's over
[155:24.45]It's gonna be that kind of night.
[155:25.83]I- no, I just have to get- it's the music, it's distracting!
[155:39.77]Alright, what about- hold on.
[155:44.65]How much more can I drag this fucking thing out?
[155:56.02]I need to find the right song.
[155:57.05]I need to find the right, like, sliding around... Hmm.
[156:05.23]Sliding around.
[156:07.05]Isn't there a... Wait.
[156:12.72]Miyazaki actually apologized to fans because of this boss.
[156:16.60]Are you serious?
[156:20.30]Alright, let's go...
[156:29.49]What is deja vu?
[156:39.37]Deja vu?
[156:45.45]Initial D, deja vu?
[156:47.90]Today I'm creating a professional Wix website for my good... ...heart.
[156:52.86]Just go to wix.com.
[156:58.99]All right, well, I accidentally just pressed the next button on my... And I don't know if... I must have played this at some point.
[157:06.43]I don't know if... This must be in my playlist.
[157:10.37]I don't know why it is.
[157:12.53]But apparently it is.
[157:13.45]All right, free, no ghost!
[157:31.73]Let's go, you motherfucker!
[157:44.24]Fucking Jesus Christ, god damn it!
[157:50.48]What's the strategy here?
[157:51.58]I just have to... What's next in my playlist?
[157:56.56]I don't even know what it is.
[157:58.12]What is it?
[157:59.77]Okay.
[158:00.37]Alright.
[158:00.85]I don't know why this is here.
[158:02.15]I've never clicked on this song.
[158:06.58]I don't know why it's here.
[158:14.52]I'm telling you right now, I promise you I've never searched for this song, but it's here.
[158:25.83]It's gonna seem really odd to everybody.
[158:27.21]It's odd to me, because I don't know why it's there, but it's there.
[158:34.49]Watch this, this is gonna be the one.
[158:43.69]No, it's not material, girl.
[158:53.91]Although, like, I would... I would probably listen to that song.
[158:56.63]That is like a... That's a good song.
[158:58.52]I've heard it a million times before.
[159:02.96]You got a problem with that song?
[159:04.13]You got a problem with me.
[159:12.11]Okay.
[159:12.43]The next song that's in my actual playlist here for some reason.
[159:18.34]This is what we're doing.
[159:21.64]Okay, here we go.
[159:26.40]This is not it.
[159:28.76]That would be great.
[159:30.06]But it's not it.
[159:30.65]It's here.
[159:31.17]So what I believe you were trying to say is thank you.
[159:35.09]Thank you?
[159:35.71]You're welcome.
[159:36.69]What?
[159:37.05]No, no, no.
[159:38.05]I didn't.
[159:38.71]I wasn't.
[159:39.45]Why would I ever say that?
[159:40.62]Okay, okay.
[159:42.46]I see what's happening, yeah.
[159:45.68]You're face to face with greatness and it's strange.
[159:47.64]Where's the breakdown?
[159:48.30]When does the song start?
[159:48.96]I don't even know how you feel.
[159:50.98]It's adorable.
[159:51.88]Well, it's nice to see that things never change.
[159:55.71]Open your eyes.
[159:57.25]Let's begin.
[159:59.15]Yes, it's really me.
[160:00.05]It's Maui.
[160:01.07]Breathe it in.
[160:02.55]I know it's a lot.
[160:03.79]The hair, the blood.
[160:06.70]That's a children's song.
[160:23.08]All right.
[160:24.04]Go!
[160:24.20]No, no, I can't go this way.
[160:26.88]I can't go this way.
[160:28.46]Yes, I can.
[160:29.42]Fuck you, Disney.
[160:30.96]The fucking, you can't go that way either.
[161:01.67]Am I going to get DMCA banned from Twitch?
[161:13.21]Alright, so I can't go all the way to the left because the whole Bowser level crumbles.
[161:17.49]I just have to... Okay.
[161:18.99]Look, we're going to go... I thought I had to jump over that.
[161:26.76]Apparently not.
[161:32.90]Let's just play some symphony music.
[161:46.60]Play the Arthur theme song.
[161:49.32]No, no, no, no.
[161:49.90]It has to have some... We started because it was a slide.
[161:53.36]We can't just start playing, like, Arthur music.
[161:55.66]That doesn't make any sense.
[161:57.00]The only reason why you heard the Moana theme song is because it was in my playlist for no reason and Ghostbusters.
[162:02.54]That don't make no sense.
[162:06.08]No, we're not playing, like, X-Men theme.
[162:07.84]No, it's got to have something to do with sliding around.
[162:14.61]And look, I don't know.
[162:16.53]I would play September.
[162:18.51]By Earth, Wind, and Fire, I would do that, but I'm afraid that I'll beat it without getting hit once.
[162:22.43]So I want to at least have some fun first before I guaranteed no-hit run with September playing.
[162:27.72]You know what I mean?
[162:29.28]You guys know that's going to happen.
[162:31.80]All right, let's play Deja Vu.
[162:47.79]I don't know.
[162:48.25]I've never heard this song.
[162:52.49]Is it too early?
[162:54.42]Touching your body.
[163:16.89]I'm alive!
[163:17.37]Wait, I'm alive!
[163:18.45]I'm alive!
[163:18.85]I'm alive!
[163:19.35]I'm alive!
[163:19.83]I'm alive!
[163:20.83]No, don't eat that!
[163:22.03]Drink!
[163:22.87]He's confused!
[163:26.79]He's confused!
[163:28.49]So am I!
[163:29.15]He's like, I don't know what you want me to do, dude!
[163:31.85]Wait, hold on!
[163:33.55]Hey!
[163:34.40]Hey!
[163:35.20]Hey!
[163:35.96]Lights and camera and action!
[163:56.56]the music, man.
[163:57.66]I think I broke my game.
[163:59.66]No, we're here.
[164:07.29]Why was he so confused?
[164:08.49]I pressed the button and he's just like, I don't know what you want me to do, man.
[164:24.54]No, no, no more music.
[164:28.39]The only song I'm gonna play is September, and that's, like, guaranteed in the zone.
[164:32.47]I'm gonna beat the boss in first try.
[164:46.92]Uh-uh-uh.
[164:49.12]Uh-uh-uh.
[164:53.60]Yeah, first try with that song, not first actual try.
[165:10.89]If I get like DMCA takedown, that's gonna be like... It's gonna be like, well, see you guys next week.
[165:24.06]Alright, here we go.
[165:24.62]It's time to beat it.
[165:29.76]It just is time to beat this.
[165:32.36]You know what I mean?
[165:41.06]This is the only song that'll do it for me.
[165:44.38]You ready?
[165:47.52]Get up for the music video.
[165:56.87]Welcome to my video.
[166:01.40]Guaranteed victory right here, guaranteed.
[166:40.29]Holy shit, this boss is fucking stupid.
[166:44.65]It's just like, there's just no rhyme or reason to any of this shit.
[167:02.38]Stop running straight at it, where am I supposed to go?
[167:08.84]I need to play it louder, that's the problem.
[167:20.43]Alright, I'm just gonna fucking walk in there with a dickload of armor.
[167:27.17]And we have to play a song that... No more fucking songs.
[167:32.35]No more songs.
[167:33.25]Like, that's what's causing me problems.
[167:42.87]Where is it?
[167:43.65]I want this guardian armor.
[167:44.87]Everything got full guardian.
[167:47.03]And the biggest shield I have.
[167:48.12]Here we go.
[167:55.98]Full guardian.
[167:57.58]And a huge fucking shield.
[168:00.37]Like the biggest one I possibly own.
[168:02.45]Is it this one?
[168:04.35]I don't even care about fighting it.
[168:11.75]This thing's pretty fucking huge.
[168:20.78]Now play all the previous songs at once.
[168:28.80]I'm really just going to... Okay, I may have made this reference before, but it's a good reference.
[168:33.32]It just is, okay?
[168:35.79]I don't know, back in the day, I've probably told this story, but everyone, those of you guys that are little brothers, right?
[168:42.93]I remember my brother putting me in full goalie gear, like full hockey equipment.
[168:50.20]We're talking helmet pads, shin pads, and he would then just kick the shit out of me.
[168:57.19]This is like, put your little brother in the hockey pads and beat him up.
[169:04.38]I'm bringing back, like, childhood memories right now.
[169:12.09]And the thing is, I thought it was fun.
[169:13.89]I had, like, a great time.
[169:16.75]Your helmet would be on.
[169:17.57]I'd have a full goalie chest.
[169:19.55]And he'd just be, like, throwing me around and, like, punching me in the chest.
[169:22.27]And I'd be like, ow!
[169:28.28]Okay, hold on.
[169:28.70]I can't even move, though.
[169:34.47]I need to hold this with two hands.
[169:36.43]Hold on.
[169:55.72]Am I really going to do this?
[169:56.98]All right.
[169:59.46]All right.
[170:07.82]All right, we're playing this apparently.
[170:14.10]I don't know why this is next.
[170:17.18]We're just like in strange, strange playlists and weird songs I've listened to.
[170:21.89]I'm just gonna get fucking claimed.
[170:36.01]Here we go.
[170:43.59]I'm ready.
[170:44.83]Take it!
[170:45.26]It works!
[171:19.53]What do I hit?
[171:27.18]Get in there!
[171:28.46]Get in there!
[171:30.10]Get in there!
[171:32.76]Get in there!
[171:34.94]I'm panicking right now.
[171:43.61]What do I do?
[171:44.47]Got it.
[171:44.67]Okay.
[171:52.10]Oh shit, oh wait, wait, wait.
[171:53.56]Okay, hold on, now I gotta play the new one.
[171:55.99]This is the new theme song from 2017.
[171:57.33]This is insane.
[172:06.62]I did, oh god, there's more?
[172:07.92]No!
[172:18.85]What do I do now?
[172:24.37]No, I can't.
[172:25.37]I gotta turn this one off.
[172:26.27]What's next?
[172:26.85]What's next?
[172:27.35]Next?
[172:27.95]Next?
[172:28.47]I just did next like three times.
[172:30.01]I love all of these shows.
[172:33.71]I love Cartoon Network.
[172:35.83]This is just like a video.
[172:37.53]So today we're going to be covering Cartoon Network.
[172:40.42]Oh, I love Cartoon Network.
[172:42.80]Oh, I love Cartoon Network.
[172:44.32]That's like the only channel I watch.
[172:45.96]I'm not doing it anymore.
[172:46.88]We're just going to fucking play.
[172:47.90]I'm done.
[172:48.40]It's over.
[172:48.88]I'm not changing songs.
[172:52.42]This is the strategy.
[172:53.28]I'm going with the strategy.
[172:54.36]Fuck the duck tails.
[172:56.06]Fuck every kind of tail.
[172:57.14]On all animals.
[172:57.84]I'm just going in.
[172:58.76]I forgot to take the fucking ring off.
[173:06.01]Oh god.
[173:06.51]Madness is overtaking me right now.
[173:13.53]Oh god.
[173:14.25]I almost just put this on.
[173:21.79]Ugh.
[173:32.59]Ugh.
[173:33.47]Alright.
[173:34.95]We had our fun.
[173:37.28]There's gonna be no more fun.
[173:39.88]I'm going to beat this boss with whatever I have to do next.
[173:45.28]With just full-on little brother hockey pad beat-me-up outfit.
[173:53.23]More memories are coming back.
[173:55.12]Okay.
[173:58.06]Here's some knowledge, right?
[173:59.36]My brother used to be a pitcher.
[174:01.20]He was really good.
[174:02.78]He was a left-handed pitcher.
[174:03.70]He pitched for his college team.
[174:06.18]He was really good.
[174:07.84]He ended up having to get elbow surgery, which kind of put him out for the rest of his time.
[174:12.41]He did a really good job as a star pitcher for the college he was at.
[174:15.99]It was a Division III team, right?
[174:18.71]So anyways, back when we were kids again, the hockey pads memory is making me think of this too.
[174:25.17]So he used to want to practice pitching.
[174:28.12]And back when he was 15, 16, he's about two and a half years older than me.
[174:32.46]So I was like 14 and he was like 16.
[174:35.38]and he would want to practice pitching.
[174:37.46]I don't know a goddamn thing about, like, catching or him throwing balls as fast as he can, as hard as he can at me.
[174:44.41]So what he would do is he would put me in the hockey pads just to make sure I wasn't gonna get hurt.
[174:49.55]So I would be in full hockey pads, pillows all over me, with a catcher's mitt.
[174:54.41]And he would be, he would throw the balls as hard as he could, like fastballs at me as hard as he could.
[174:59.47]And like they would hit me in the face and like the chest and the stomach.
[175:02.65]And it would hurt a lot, but it didn't hurt that much because I had the hockey pads on.
[175:06.01]And I'm just sitting here laughing about, my god, I used to get like, my brother used to beat the shit out of me, huh?
[175:14.23]Like I was in full gear scared, just like, oh my god, I don't know how to catch like a 78 and 85 mile per hour fastball.
[175:21.24]And I would miss.
[175:21.84]It would hit me in the glove and then in the mouth.
[175:25.33]I was just his personal little catcher.
[175:28.49]And I had a bunch of fun.
[175:30.43]That was a ton of fun.
[175:33.43]I would do that again.
[175:40.89]No.
[175:41.15]No song.
[175:41.81]Why is this already on fire?
[175:42.98]Okay.
[175:45.60]Okay.
[175:48.49]So now I got both of things destroyed.
[175:50.65]Now he's a phoenix.
[175:52.75]So is this the point where I fight the boss?
[175:57.05]I don't know.
[176:04.65]Good thing I got my fucking cocky pads on.
[176:07.49]Come on.
[176:08.41]Come on, throw the pitch as fast as you can.
[176:11.03]Oh, it hurts, but I like it.
[176:22.37]How do I like let's get closer Oh shit Look at that poise What am I doing?
[176:39.46]What am I doing?
[176:44.26]What happened to me?
[176:45.13]What the fuck was that?
[176:46.43]Why did I just grow mushrooms out of my body?
[176:50.87]Wait, why is this broken?
[176:52.91]I can go down there.
[176:53.71]Okay, it just threw me here.
[176:57.15]What can I do down here?
[177:04.62]Oh, fuck you, game.
[177:12.01]Um, I don't know what's going on.
[177:12.98]Is he, like, come in here after me?
[177:25.76]Wait, there's another one of those things in here.
[177:27.34]Okay.
[177:31.65]Oh, fuck.
[177:32.13]What's going on here?
[178:12.62]I beat the slide level!
[178:14.90]What do you got?
[178:17.09]Can't fuck with me.
[178:18.03]I beat the slide level.
[178:21.79]That was it, huh?
[178:30.79]Okay.
[178:33.90]Well, that, uh, that was interesting, I guess.
[178:35.96]That boss is... That's not even a boss.
[178:39.06]Did I just beat Dark Souls?
[178:43.08]Alright, we're at 90.
[178:44.64]We made it to 90.
[178:45.22]And we're about to do the last part of the game.
[178:48.32]I think.
[178:48.90]Is this it?
[178:49.50]Where do I go from here?
[178:51.16]Is there any more after this here?
[179:04.87]Now it's just Duke's archive.
[179:06.59]That's it, right?
[179:14.60]Well, that was really, that was dumb.
[179:17.40]I mean, okay, hold on a second.
[179:18.32]That was really dumb, but I had a great time.
[179:22.15]Without that music, I probably would have been really mad dying like ten times to this boss.
[179:29.39]But, uh, regardless, I guess let's go back to... Uh... We need to go to warp.
[179:38.84]No, warp.
[179:41.10]Orlando.
[179:42.29]This will take us to the Duke's Archives, which is the last area, I believe.
[179:46.95]I think this is it.
[179:51.25]Let me take off my hockey pads.
[179:52.87]Actually, I'm going to take this opportunity.
[179:56.31]I'm going to grab a drink.
[179:57.66]I'm just going to get a water.
[180:01.28]Take a piss.
[180:02.66]And we will do the last part of the... I already did the DLC.
[180:06.26]DLC is already complete.
[180:09.96]So I will be back in two minutes.
[180:12.52]Grab yourself something to drink too.
[180:25.07]That was wrong.
[180:25.55]Here it is.
[182:32.30]I gave myself, like, a little headache there, laughing at that shit.
[182:38.63]Let us get to the end of Dark Souls.
[182:43.45]Almost there.
[182:47.17]Okay.
[182:48.11]Change equipment.
[182:48.75]Let's get this off.
[182:51.27]Go back to the... What was it called?
[182:52.55]The green crest shield?
[182:54.99]Grass crest shield.
[182:56.03]There it is.
[182:58.47]No, I want it over here.
[183:06.37]Oh.
[183:06.53]Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
[183:10.75]Where are you?
[183:12.29]There you are.
[183:13.87]Oh my god, why are you doing that?
[183:17.00]Okay, back to a normal.
[183:20.32]At least slightly normal.
[183:21.22]This one we can just put that on.
[183:25.02]Is that 20 now?
[183:25.92]I can't really do much more than this.
[183:27.40]Maybe one little pair of gloves?
[183:31.36]Painted guardian gloves and then like a little pair of sandals, maybe?
[183:40.42]That looks good to me.
[183:41.53]Okay.
[183:49.65]Everyone's telling me to betray my queen.
[183:51.31]I don't know what you mean by that.
[184:02.54]I really wish there was just a repair all.
[184:04.28]That would be easy, wouldn't it?
[184:08.46]Use the orb.
[184:09.12]Use the orb!
[184:10.00]Okay, get this off.
[184:17.36]Let's go back to... Hornet Ring sounds like fun to use.
[184:20.73]I almost want to wear this.
[184:29.55]Just a ton of defense without having to...
[184:32.67]and I am still being able to roll around.
[184:34.23]We'll stick with this for now.
[184:44.85]Alright.
[184:46.99]Let's go to the Duke's Archives.
[184:56.26]Go kill the Puge Lady?
[184:58.82]Why would I want to do that?
[185:05.53]Well, at least I can go around you.
[185:16.19]It's content I'm going to forget to do.
[185:19.16]Well, just remind me.
[185:24.54]Just remind me.
[185:32.91]We're reminding you right now.
[185:34.41]Well, I mean, like, remind me later.
[185:42.14]After we do Duke's Archives.
[185:48.70]Ugh.
[185:49.83]Well, let's go.
[185:53.93]You're gonna say no next time, too, because you've said no every time.
[185:58.81]Well, we'll just catch up with me in, like, an hour, and we'll see where we are.
[186:04.50]I already asked you to remind me later, but just remind me later again.
[186:09.26]Just keep me up to date.
[186:20.48]So, let me ask you a question.
[186:23.66]After this area, am I fighting the final boss?
[186:27.59]Are we in final boss area?
[186:29.03]Okay, hold on.
[186:29.57]Let me, like, not die.
[186:41.72]ask me later see there you see now you're learning now you're understanding really that was far man we're getting so hit so many times unnecessarily I thought he was dead I thought he was dead
[187:13.21]Okay, well, now let me drink, like, three Estuses.
[187:19.68]Jesus, how many of these fucking people are there?
[187:27.06]It's Estai.
[187:31.34]Well, Duke's Archives.
[187:32.66]There he goes, doing his little magic chant thing.
[187:35.53]You're dead.
[187:38.77]This place looks kind of cool.
[187:39.63]It's a little library, reminds me of Bloodborne.
[187:42.93]This actually looks exactly like Kay and Hurst.
[187:46.97]Kay and Hurst?
[187:54.94]These guys are just paranoid fighting these guys for some reason.
[188:10.70]It's a Bloodborne ripoff.
[188:12.04]Well, no, it's an asset turn that they turned into a different video game.
[188:18.27]Well, the DLC for that said video game.
[188:25.67]I don't even know why I'm attempting to do that.
[188:27.01]Just kill the damn guy.
[188:34.52]Wait, why is everybody saying, what, WTF, WTF, WTF?
[188:36.84]WTF?
[188:39.26]WTF?
[188:41.38]What are you guys WTFing?
[188:46.00]I don't know what we're... I don't know what we're fucking here.
[188:48.02]I don't know what the thing is that we're fucking is.
[188:49.91]I don't understand.
[188:53.17]Can I break the tables?
[188:54.31]No.
[188:55.49]Maybe I can.
[189:02.53]Hey, you.
[189:04.15]There's a really cool sword.
[189:08.76]I don't even care.
[189:09.36]I have my...
[189:11.40]butcher's knife.
[189:12.08]I don't need cool weapons.
[189:13.32]Ooh, you came out of nowhere.
[189:24.63]Please.
[189:30.45]I'm getting trolled?
[189:32.67]How dare you.
[189:36.76]Mimic!
[189:40.59]Twinkling Titanite.
[189:48.39]Let's go around the other side too, just to see it all.
[189:53.84]Streamer dies to skeletons after 30 hours in-game.
[189:58.88]What, like you didn't die to these skeletons?
[190:03.34]No, sorry, I forgot.
[190:04.10]You beat the game at like level 20.
[190:22.39]No, it didn't work!
[190:25.39]It didn't work!
[190:25.95]Oh my god, I love this troll face emote.
[190:37.63]Ah, I thought you were gonna fool me with this bullshit.
[190:44.33]Not today.
[190:49.91]Crystal Night Shield?
[190:52.47]Don't I already have one of these?
[190:53.37]I thought I already had one of those.
[191:01.25]Oh, hi.
[191:05.63]Uh... No big dragon that flies by.
[191:08.61]No... Nothing cool.
[191:10.69]Nothing fun.
[191:13.39]Just a view of clouds.
[191:14.71]Okay.
[191:18.01]Looks like we're going up.
[191:19.50]I don't think there's anywhere else to go.
[191:23.37]Elevator.
[191:27.47]I'm the developer of this game.
[191:28.71]You know, it's weird.
[191:29.17]I've seen, like, a lot of you guys say that.
[191:31.39]Which is kind of funny because I made this fucking game.
[191:35.99]So, you guys can come in here and troll and act like assholes, but I'm the one that made the game.
[191:41.11]Ooh, what is this?
[191:49.10]Do I have to push this into, like, a certain slot to open up a door to get a key?
[191:53.40]Hmm cool.
[191:54.92]All right.
[191:55.38]No nothing I don't like this hallway.
[192:05.30]I know I knew that's why I didn't like it Really?
[192:13.33]Fighting like a candy soldier This guy like desperately wants to be a bird
[192:31.17]Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
[192:36.31]Blue titanite chunk.
[192:36.39]Cool.
[192:37.03]Magic weapon I'm assuming?
[192:50.32]Okay.
[192:53.76]I'm assuming- no wait this is a boss!
[192:58.22]oh my god it's the moonlit butterfly on roids okay what's going on here oh there's like a no but is there like a hold on let me figure this out
[193:30.89]Okay.
[193:43.07]This is not the bonfire.
[193:48.99]Wait.
[193:49.27]I was supposed to die there?
[193:52.60]That's an intentional death there.
[193:59.14]I got arrested.
[194:02.96]Can I talk to this guy?
[194:07.29]Can I just kill this guy through the wall?
[194:10.97]Oh, there's other criminals in here.
[194:13.49]Oi, mate.
[194:14.83]You're new right here.
[194:16.59]What you in for?
[194:18.94]You walked into that fucking dragon's lair, so did we.
[194:26.74]Get him, mates!
[194:31.26]Ow.
[194:33.41]Ow!
[194:33.71]No, please!
[194:34.19]I'm sorry!
[194:34.77]Ow!
[194:36.03]Why don't they make it more realistic?
[194:47.24]You know, video games, they gotta come a little bit further, I think.
[194:52.17]Because people just get like slashed with swords and knives in their backs and they just go like... No, where is like the screaming?
[195:00.70]And like, please don't, please don't do it!
[195:02.02]And like the knife goes in the back and stuff.
[195:11.71]I mean, I guess they are like skeletons.
[195:13.25]Never mind.
[195:13.63]That doesn't make any sense.
[195:22.12]Sadist.
[195:23.40]Alright, so I have to kill the guy right there.
[195:25.00]Let me just, like, let me kindle this.
[195:34.28]Every time I do, like, for instance, when I parry, especially like a human character, when I parry a human and I do the, uh, you know, the forward-facing riposte, right?
[195:41.91]Whatever the fucking word is.
[195:44.03]I'm just, I want the guy to be like, Oh no, please!
[195:48.05]Please!
[195:50.89]It would make it more visceral.
[195:52.94]What am I looking for?
[195:54.44]Humanoid.
[195:55.56]Humanity.
[195:56.76]If I passed it like four fucking times.
[195:58.44]Alright, please.
[196:01.86]Where is my humanity?
[196:15.66]Stop kindling?
[196:16.42]What do you mean stop kindling?
[196:19.61]At least kindle a 10, man.
[196:22.01]Every Souls game, you have at least 10 Estus.
[196:24.83]Come on.
[196:28.35]Alright, so let's kill this guy through the wall.
[196:30.75]Because that's what you have to do.
[196:31.81]Because obviously, like... I got the key.
[196:36.52]Why wouldn't they take my equipment?
[196:39.32]That seems really dumb.
[196:42.98]Yeah, throw him in a cell.
[196:45.03]Let him keep all of his powerful fucking equipment that he's stolen from way, way stronger people than us.
[196:53.07]Can't open that one.
[196:55.39]It's too heavy for them.
[196:59.81]Alright, well, let's go.
[197:01.57]What is this?
[197:04.87]You're trying to get in the way from this one.
[197:06.29]Yeah.
[197:20.40]Okay, so he released the wig snails.
[197:22.26]Now what?
[197:28.78]Okay.
[197:35.00]No, wait a minute!
[197:36.06]Wait, I'm sorry!
[197:40.62]Alright, I'm not gonna do... Where are they... Where are you going?
[197:44.20]Those things are fucking scary, mate.
[197:45.88]I don't want anything to do with those.
[197:46.98]No, please stop hitting me.
[197:48.34]Please, just let me get out of here.
[197:49.94]Those things are gonna kill us all, man.
[197:52.98]No, please.
[197:54.85]I'm so sorry.
[197:55.45]I don't know who you fought before this.
[197:57.27]I don't know what you think of me.
[197:59.93]But I'm just trying to get out of here, man.
[198:01.71]I gotta go.
[198:02.11]My wife has been fucking calling me for like the last three hours, dude.
[198:05.11]Like, I'm just saying, I'm not gonna hurt you.
[198:08.14]No, please, get out of here.
[198:18.19]No more of that.
[198:20.74]What was the point of doing this?
[198:26.74]Because I can walk this way?
[198:37.55]I don't think I want to tightrope walk this right now.
[198:39.21]That's probably a bad idea.
[198:44.37]I can't open that.
[198:44.87]That's probably a shortcut.
[198:49.27]Do a flip.
[198:53.37]Well, here they come.
[198:56.76]How dangerous can they be?
[199:14.81]They drop humanity.
[199:15.53]That's pretty cool.
[199:17.77]Okay, nothing else I can do over there, so let's just go down.
[199:20.19]I don't know what that guy was so scared of.
[199:25.11]Can I unlock other cells when people are in them?
[199:32.68]That's how you're going to repay me?
[199:40.05]I let you free and that's what you do.
[199:41.45]Okay.
[199:41.65]Okay.
[199:53.05]That echo is actually pretty... That's pretty cool.
[199:55.85]I like the echo.
[199:59.59]You saw what you did to the guards?
[200:06.83]This one's locked.
[200:11.79]There's an item right there.
[200:16.07]I wonder if I can fall from up there.
[200:18.77]No, definitely not.
[200:34.70]The one wall I don't check.
[200:36.06]Are you serious?
[200:40.44]No, really?
[200:47.73]You gotta be kidding me.
[200:48.69]The one thing I didn't hit?
[200:55.17]Huh.
[200:57.97]Okay.
[201:16.52]Fuck yourself.
[201:27.83]One guy.
[201:28.39]Well, I told you.
[201:29.13]One of these days, you're gonna be the one guy.
[201:31.11]You will be that one guy.
[201:32.51]Except I can drop down here.
[201:33.51]Let me see.
[201:46.80]Well, that's how you get an item.
[201:48.70]Archive prison extra key.
[201:52.75]I'm assuming to open the other extra doors that I couldn't unlock up there.
[202:02.79]Oh my god, I jumped into it.
[202:03.89]Ooh, that hurts.
[202:14.64]Got my DLC key.
[202:21.25]God, I wish that was me.
[202:26.89]Use the extra key.
[202:29.35]Any extra content in here?
[202:30.43]Wait a minute, hold on.
[202:45.32]That's it.
[202:49.59]You know, I did that for one reason.
[202:52.65]Because I'm certain that somebody, somewhere, was going to tell me to go do that again.
[202:57.45]I've already opened those doors, so let's just go.
[203:03.26]Somebody would have told me to do that.
[203:09.44]I didn't hit the right brick.
[203:10.58]Well, that's too bad.
[203:11.32]I don't get the secrets.
[203:13.90]I will never fully complete Dark Souls, apparently.
[203:22.86]Nothing else.
[203:23.70]Just a few more of these guys.
[203:24.90]And then... Interesting.
[203:27.57]Oh, I get it now.
[203:28.31]I see.
[203:28.51]We're inside of a clock.
[203:29.63]Okay.
[203:30.97]So I got shrunk down in his little mini clock prison.
[203:34.15]We're going to come out of a grandfather clock in his living room.
[203:36.17]He's going to be reading the newspaper.
[203:37.19]We're going to fucking backstab him.
[203:54.08]Alright.
[203:55.20]Uh, examine.
[203:56.72]Something around here.
[204:05.81]Repair the clock.
[204:09.53]Nothing over here.
[204:16.66]I can go up there, which... Let's do it, just because.
[204:33.00]Alright, well, I... Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.
[204:42.70]Oh, fuck me.
[204:43.44]Alright, get the Magician first.
[204:55.10]Am I going to PvP afterwards?
[204:57.44]Hold on.
[205:00.36]Let's see where we are.
[205:01.28]Because I thought I was going to be able to finish Dark Souls tonight.
[205:04.94]But we might beat the game tonight.
[205:09.02]We'll at least do that.
[205:12.18]There's the giant door.
[205:15.46]We will at least beat the game tonight.
[205:28.91]Okay, what did that do?
[205:32.45]Once we get to the end of the game, we'll see how much time... I'm assuming I'll probably be tard.
[205:37.44]Tard.
[205:41.82]You're gonna go till you finish?
[205:42.76]No, yeah, we're gonna finish the game tonight.
[205:44.72]I will beat Dark Souls tonight.
[205:48.47]But I don't know if we'll do PvP tonight.
[205:51.89]Are these NPCs?
[206:07.23]Let's go open the door.
[206:13.64]Sad monsters.
[206:17.60]But yeah, we'll see.
[206:18.30]When we get to the end of the game, I might do... We'll go back to Dark Souls for PvP.
[206:24.45]We'll just do like a multiplayer night.
[206:27.45]Maybe we'll do like a thing where I might make another character in this game.
[206:31.21]Because can't you have like six people in a game now?
[206:34.56]We might just dick around in multiplayer for like a couple hours.
[206:37.00]Do some PvP.
[206:45.99]Yeah, so we'll put a password on it.
[206:49.29]Have a little fun for a couple hours maybe in the next couple of streams.
[206:56.86]Heavy rain?
[206:57.84]I cannot play heavy rain.
[207:01.30]I have seen the end of Heavy Rain.
[207:03.56]I know exactly how it ends.
[207:04.78]I know the whole story, so I can't really play it.
[207:09.09]It would be... I can't do it.
[207:12.29]Okay, so we just... This is the big door.
[207:19.01]Oh, hello.
[207:21.68]Whoops.
[207:22.04]Well, I don't even need to do that.
[207:28.15]What the hell was that?
[207:29.85]What just hit me?
[207:31.13]Oh, somebody's shooting arrows at me.
[207:32.15]Oh, this guy's shooting arrows.
[207:39.94]That's a cool looking fortress over there.
[207:52.53]Up we go.
[207:59.82]Looking for an elevator here of some sort Looking for some kind of skip back down to the ground floor, which there it is.
[208:14.41]I bet you we find one If I were curious little man Good thing I just said little man.
[208:23.66]I'm glad I just said that out loud.
[208:25.48]Oh
[208:28.80]Okay, I can fall down.
[208:29.82]I'm not gonna fall there just yet.
[208:30.94]Oh, let's go down.
[208:37.69]Let's just take a peek.
[208:39.51]Why not, right?
[208:46.49]Oh my god, this stupid fucking...
[208:54.71]Oh my god, will you suck my ass?
[208:57.51]Seriously, fuck off.
[209:01.85]That's a... their shield they're using?
[209:11.11]Okay, where's the button that I press to, like, turn to go quickly?
[209:14.68]Where's the button?
[209:21.64]Alright, where's the button?
[209:22.36]You know what I'm saying?
[209:27.61]There's so many places to go right here.
[209:35.31]There's no button over here.
[209:42.12]Oh, fuck you.
[209:43.80]I'll fuck you twice.
[209:44.68]I'll fuck you a third time.
[209:56.96]Where are you coming from?
[210:05.09]Dickhead.
[210:05.47]I can keep going down.
[210:09.81]Yeah, I'm going up.
[210:17.84]I got to kill this dude.
[210:18.66]This dude's going to cause so many problems for me.
[210:20.88]He just is.
[210:21.36]Nothing over there.
[210:26.91]I wanted to lock on to you.
[210:28.93]Oh, please.
[210:29.57]Why?
[210:30.07]Lock on to him.
[210:30.75]What in the name of tarnation is this?
[210:37.05]Seriously, what in tarnation was that?
[210:38.43]Okay.
[210:53.30]I can't go up any further.
[210:58.80]I just have to go down.
[210:59.82]Any secret passage or something?
[211:04.80]No.
[211:08.81]Door?
[211:10.31]Oh, shit.
[211:10.89]That guy's gonna cause a problem, isn't he?
[211:21.13]No swear words.
[211:23.69]Not tonight.
[211:37.15]Oh, thank goodness.
[211:38.67]All right, bonfire.
[211:39.39]Nice.
[211:43.83]I should probably kindle this one too.
[211:48.47]Because why not?
[211:49.47]I have the humanity.
[211:58.08]Looking good.
[212:02.82]That looks fine.
[212:07.19]Beautiful.
[212:09.47]Now I can go in one of those many rooms that are over here.
[212:17.04]I'm very British?
[212:20.00]British?
[212:21.14]Where are you getting British from?
[212:30.87]Fuck it.
[212:32.89]This might have been a bad idea.
[212:40.75]Well, I would have had it.
[212:43.26]Nah, I'm gonna get overwhelmed if I don't cut the shit here.
[212:48.30]Oh, speaking of getting overwhelmed.
[212:50.48]It's about to happen.
[212:51.18]Alright, made it.
[213:05.27]Crystal straight sword!
[213:09.79]So I've already been here.
[213:10.67]And the question is, where from here?
[213:19.34]I think that I can, wait, I can pull this.
[213:20.84]This drops, so this, you go through here, this pulls the elevator down or up?
[213:33.94]I'm not sure what I'm looking at here.
[213:38.84]There it is, okay.
[213:44.10]Uh, going up.
[213:57.49]This takes us back to here.
[213:59.29]Remember I said, oh, move that.
[214:02.69]So now we're back.
[214:04.33]This is where that dragon is.
[214:09.95]Can I not fight him, though?
[214:13.41]Well, what?
[214:13.89]How does this work?
[214:15.75]Am I against the same exact thing gonna happen?
[214:21.15]Uh... I don't know.
[214:32.12]Am I gonna get put in jail again?
[214:33.26]Alright, well...
[214:50.94]Why are they not on my fucking bar?
[215:23.02]You can walk out?
[215:23.68]I didn't know you could walk out.
[215:24.91]Speaking of bones, just bone back.
[215:34.71]So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[215:36.09]I have to like activate something, right?
[215:37.87]I have to like pull some lever.
[215:46.45]Don't ask me where the fuck you do that.
[215:47.77]Let me look down here one more time.
[215:52.81]I mean, there's like the... If I play the music, will he stop?
[216:01.04]Alright, well how do I... Where's the key to open this door?
[216:23.96]I'm not gonna sleep at that bonfire yet.
[216:28.86]Do I already have the key for this thing?
[216:43.25]I made the key.
[216:56.43]These people don't attack because... I thought if the music was... I thought the music is off, so now they're crying.
[217:25.98]Somebody dropped a rare item.
[217:28.84]No, that's not that rare Yeah What the fuck did the skeleton come from
[217:54.57]Miracle bountiful sight.
[217:57.11]Two miracles.
[217:59.78]Okay, so... Open.
[218:03.94]It's locked.
[218:08.01]Fuck.
[218:25.48]Um... Should I turn on the music?
[218:31.87]Should I go to the other bonfire and just keep looking around?
[218:33.67]I feel like I should just... I'm gonna lose the 50,000 souls here.
[218:37.33]I'm gonna get fucking sniped by this guy.
[218:47.87]God damn it, dude.
[219:02.11]There's nothing else in this room, is there?
[219:04.27]I'm gonna just bone back to that where I just was.
[219:13.16]And by the way, get it on your fucking bar.
[219:16.74]You...
[219:26.75]I'm gonna sell every single one of these to Fram.
[219:29.57]Every single thing here.
[219:31.18]I will literally only have two items in my inventory.
[219:37.38]He's gonna eat it all.
[219:39.82]What?
[219:43.75]What?
[219:53.00]I can't warp- Oh my fucking god damn it.
[219:55.65]Whatever, just go up from here.

[220:17.78]Pain in the ass.
[220:18.54]Okay.
[220:20.78]Well...
[220:26.90]See if I missed anything on the way to that bonfire.
[220:46.33]Don't do it!
[220:47.63]No, I already overplayed that one.
[220:54.17]Nothing else here.
[220:56.07]This takes me this way.
[220:56.95]I can go straight through here.
[220:58.47]So I didn't go straight this last time.
[221:02.96]We kind of just walked around.
[221:04.10]So what happens if I just go here now?
[221:10.76]Like, I need to go up there.
[221:13.58]Hold on.
[221:22.10]I was about to just homeward bone because my ex... Don't even say it.
[221:29.75]What is the song everybody keeps saying?
[221:33.07]Tatarkin?
[221:34.03]Tatanka?
[221:37.65]No, I don't... Alright, this takes me up.
[221:39.45]This is where I... I didn't go here yet.
[221:41.59]What the hell does this thing do?
[221:42.86]Oh god, it's... You turn the handle and you move around.
[221:44.92]You're too slow and you blew it for me.
[222:01.05]Another one of these straight swords.
[222:12.13]Okay.
[222:12.83]So I can turn the wheel, which would move, I'm assuming, this centerpiece to the left or to the right over here.
[222:20.88]Although I have no idea what the hell it's going to do.
[222:22.64]It's going to move it that way.
[222:24.70]So I can leave that way.
[222:25.74]Okay, hold on.
[222:29.60]Alright, let's spin this thing around.
[222:35.22]What do you guys want me to do?
[222:35.86]You want me to play the General Tarkun speech from Star Wars?
[222:42.20]I don't know why.
[222:42.76]I mean, I guess I could.
[222:44.40]I'm not sure what that would achieve, but I mean... I mean, it is available to watch.
[222:59.79]Let me go around.
[223:05.85]Just wasting all these Estus flasks.
[223:19.26]Nothing else?
[223:21.00]Okay.
[223:23.78]Play the new Drake album?
[223:25.52]I don't listen to Drake.
[223:39.56]Alright, well this thing has that guy, so I think we're in the right direction here.
[223:52.49]What do I listen to?
[223:54.63]I listen to, on repeat, the Fullmetal Alchemist OST.
[223:59.71]I don't listen to any other music.
[224:01.27]That is the only music I listen to.
[224:09.16]Does that thing have a stupid thing in the middle too?
[224:10.86]It does.
[224:11.30]So how am I supposed to get down there?
[224:13.04]Ay-yay-yay.
[224:16.17]Okay, I can go from here actually.
[224:19.42]Ooh.
[224:20.22]I think somebody just figured it out.
[224:40.26]Oh, and I also listened to the West Side Story soundtrack.
[224:43.82]So it's either Fullmetal Alchemist OST or West Side Story Full soundtrack.
[224:58.29]Strong magic shield.
[224:59.33]That's sorcery.
[225:00.15]We don't use that.
[225:06.00]Or I watch the Season 1 Attack on Titan intro a hundred times in a row until I can't stand it anymore.
[225:17.88]What am I missing here?
[225:22.91]Should I turn this thing back around?
[225:30.59]Wait, hold on.
[225:31.23]What is out here?
[225:38.42]There's another way to go.
[225:43.67]No, I already was out here.
[225:45.81]Shit.
[225:52.81]So if I turn this, where does it go then?
[225:54.46]We're gonna find out.
[225:58.26]Let's just turn it.
[226:06.10]Back to the other... Wasn't it already here?
[226:12.50]No, it already was this way.
[226:41.36]Down here.
[226:52.27]No, I was already down this way.
[226:58.57]I think I had it correct.
[226:59.52]No, okay.
[227:00.18]I'm going to turn.
[227:01.04]I got it.
[227:01.42]Hold on.
[227:15.37]Too much mercury.
[227:16.93]I've never played this before!
[227:19.49]This is all... Look, I know you have this information, but I don't.
[227:23.71]I don't know how many times I have to explain this.
[227:29.59]This is literally the first time I have ever, ever seen this place.
[227:35.31]In my entire life.
[227:36.85]In my whole life!
[227:38.59]In my entire life!
[227:40.49]I've never seen this!
[227:42.69]I understand you've seen it a hundred times.
[227:44.79]I ain't ever seen it.
[227:51.75]Looks like we're going down here.
[227:56.74]I'm a dev?
[227:57.32]Yeah, I'm a dev.
[227:58.16]I made the fucking... The Dragon Zone.
[228:00.76]I didn't... I never saw this place.
[228:02.08]I just worked on it.
[228:04.24]I just like made bookshelves and assets.
[228:06.14]I made this book on the ground.
[228:07.22]I don't know where they put it.
[228:08.02]Oh, shit.
[228:11.89]Okay, hold on.
[228:15.94]Give me my light.
[228:27.03]Where is it?
[228:27.45]Right here.
[228:34.75]This doesn't do anything.
[228:38.94]I was afraid of a hole being in the ground.
[228:40.30]I was going to fall through it.
[228:43.93]Okay, this is not a mimic.
[228:50.50]What about back there?
[228:51.20]No.
[228:55.48]Watch out for the hole!
[228:56.20]Watch out for the hole!
[228:57.00]Alright, what about this?
[229:05.85]That's not... It looks like an illusion wall.
[229:07.71]It really does.
[229:08.23]Alright, hold on.
[229:16.34]Six-Eyed Helm of the Channeler's Robe.
[229:18.06]Okay, that's like a sorcery robe.
[229:21.35]Cool.
[229:24.39]More levers to pull.
[229:28.71]Archive Tower Giant Cell Key.
[229:32.75]Just got the key, boys and girls.
[229:36.17]And almost opened that without killing it first.
[229:49.07]Hold on.
[229:49.69]Wait, is that the thing on the head?
[229:50.75]Oh, it's the head.
[229:52.97]Yes, it is.
[229:55.09]Oh, fantastic.
[229:59.42]Monster head resembling a treasure chest once an ancient god has said this is the symbol of shame imposed on a long-lost clan.
[230:05.74]Wearing this slightly raises soul absorption and item discovery, but also affects its wearer with the curse of the branded.
[230:13.98]I don't think I should put that on.
[230:16.38]Isn't that going to put my... What does that mean?
[230:19.14]What's it going to do to me?
[230:31.45]What did I do?
[230:38.67]Oh, you take damage over time.
[230:40.25]Okay.
[230:42.17]Alright, well fuck it.
[230:42.82]Let's wear it.
[230:50.96]There was another thing to pull over here, though.
[230:54.59]Alright, I mean, I have to put on the huge fat guy suit with this and just be like a cookie monster.
[230:59.45]I mean, come on, right?
[231:03.50]I wish you could dye your clothes.
[231:04.78]Because I would just do all blue and be the cookie monster.
[231:09.26]It would be perfect.
[231:20.09]Where is it?
[231:24.11]Where are the big fat guy ones?
[231:29.45]Okay, what about down here?
[231:30.85]We need... Alright, here we go.
[231:39.14]Does he actually drink it in his mouth?
[231:43.26]I mean, kind of.
[231:44.70]Now this opens up this, right?
[231:54.34]And that looks like a shortcut to me.
[231:56.58]It sure does.
[231:59.44]Uh-huh.
[232:14.17]I'm mid-rolling, so this is okay.
[232:15.71]I'm alright with this.
[232:25.02]Looking good.
[232:25.52]Yeah, I'm liking this outfit.
[232:29.80]Did I miss anything else?
[232:32.14]No, I got everything.
[232:36.46]If I join the Darkmoon Covenant, I can be summoned as a blue cookie monster.
[232:39.50]That's good to know.
[232:46.77]Nothing else?
[232:47.23]I don't want to miss anything.
[232:48.51]Ah, I knew it.
[232:52.14]Crystal Ember.
[232:54.00]Give that to the blacksmith and he will make me an item I will never use.
[232:57.42]Alright, here we go.
[232:59.42]Yeah, I know it's ticking me.
[233:14.20]Ticking on my health.
[233:15.01]Alright, here we go.
[233:15.71]Am I about to go in the back door to fight the dragon?
[233:22.77]This looks like a backdoor to fight Mr. Dragon.
[233:27.83]If I was to guess.
[233:28.39]Let's take a guess.
[233:37.34]Was I supposed to fall?
[233:38.78]Yeah, I was.
[233:39.54]Alright.
[233:42.82]Fuck.
[233:43.86]Okay.
[233:44.96]We're like outside here.
[233:50.12]I mean, I know it was like funny to have on, but I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[233:52.68]So I'm not certain I want to keep the cookie monster helmet on.
[233:58.26]I did just, I don't want to die.
[233:59.72]Oh, whatever.
[234:01.22]It looks, it's too cool.
[234:02.42]I can't take it off.
[234:08.30]This puts us back where the crystal people are, I guess.
[234:14.20]Didn't need to dodge there.
[234:15.47]Why did you do that?
[234:25.63]How could I not keep on the Cookie Monster?
[234:27.15]Because it just hurts.
[234:29.99]I just take forever damage.
[234:36.03]Swear it during boss fights?
[234:37.75]That's not a bad idea.
[234:38.61]What are they... Why are they all over here?
[234:40.63]What's with the whole congregation over here?
[234:52.46]You guys, like, protecting something?
[234:53.70]Or... I don't... I guess not.
[235:01.36]They were just having a chat.
[235:03.72]That's what it looks like.
[235:04.42]I'm gonna have like a hundred thousand souls here.
[235:12.45]Once I go pick them up at Seath.
[235:17.37]Okay.
[235:20.65]Yeah, I'm gonna take this off for now because I don't know where I'm going.
[235:23.87]Look, I'll replace it with like the dumb beehive face.
[235:26.31]No, I won't.
[235:26.79]Fuck that.
[235:27.13]This thing's stupid.
[235:29.60]Here, does that make you happy?
[235:34.88]Just wait till we have Smaug's hammer.
[235:37.00]And this.
[235:47.76]Can't go that way.
[236:01.09]Alrighty.
[236:03.82]These enemies are just kind of placed in the corners for no reason.
[236:13.76]Usually if there's two or three of them, I'm saying, wow, that's different.
[236:16.66]Okay, that's the thing I saw in the distance.
[236:20.15]What's that guy doing over there?
[236:22.09]There's no reason for him to be there.
[236:23.51]But I have to go over there now.
[236:26.01]Because I have to just see what's over there.
[236:28.09]And there's nothing going to be there.
[236:29.19]It's a guy in the corner.
[236:32.17]What is the purpose of him being here?
[236:36.67]See?
[236:36.87]It's like, what the hell are you doing here?
[236:40.95]Wait, I hear a Cookie Monster bug.
[236:44.11]No, there's no reason for him to be here.
[236:45.59]He's just here.
[237:01.14]Yeah, it's just... They just hang out in the corners, okay.
[237:06.29]Visions of Pointless.
[237:07.31]Yeah, I've only had my notepad out.
[237:14.21]Let's take a wild guess.
[237:15.77]I'm gonna get to the edge here.
[237:18.54]And I'm gonna look over and I'm gonna be able to jumping R1 on Seath's head.
[237:22.72]Is there anything else here to do?
[237:29.00]Or am I just wasting time?
[237:42.53]Nothing else at all.
[237:45.21]Such a huge open area, you'd figure there'd be something else here.
[237:49.97]Ayayay, okay, well, whatever.
[237:51.51]I guess this is where you farm blue chunks.
[238:04.42]Alright.
[238:07.43]Oh, here we go.
[238:09.07]I'm gonna look down, I'm gonna see his head, and we're gonna jumping R1 his head.
[238:12.09]It's gonna be brilliant.
[238:30.75]Crystal cave?
[238:32.37]Am I going to a new zone?
[238:36.31]Um...
[238:42.32]Where is he?
[238:43.68]Is that him all the way down there?
[238:46.54]No, there's like other dragons in here.
[238:48.88]Oh, shit.
[238:51.24]Oh, shit.
[238:51.94]Okay, play it cool.
[238:53.26]No, I didn't play it cool.
[238:54.40]I fucking did.
[238:55.16]Why didn't I know you were gonna slide off like that?
[238:57.08]I didn't know you slid down if you went down.
[238:58.90]Oh, come on.
[239:00.60]Why did I slide?
[239:01.64]I didn't slide on any other part of that.
[239:05.46]You get to a certain portion of that thing that's downward like 80 degrees and you slide?
[239:12.42]What the fuck was that?
[239:13.50]Well, there go 50,000 souls.
[239:22.93]Gone.
[239:23.31]Oh, well.
[239:23.63]Don't even need them.
[239:27.51]What was I gonna use them on?
[239:29.09]I've already got... I got to meme level, right?
[239:31.23]I got to 90.
[239:31.87]That's like... You're playing Dark Souls.
[239:34.45]You got to the end.
[239:46.61]Go to 100.
[239:46.91]If I need to, I will.
[239:49.43]I don't know if I will.
[239:51.59]Glad I wasted 15 full minutes walking around in a circle killing blue guys.
[239:58.47]Gee, I have an idea.
[239:59.88]Why don't we put them all in the absolute corner of the huge area before Crystal Caves.
[240:05.70]No items there.
[240:06.74]There won't be any items.
[240:07.90]Don't worry.
[240:10.72]Oh, God.
[240:11.76]Think fast.
[240:12.64]Decision time.
[240:13.32]Decisions time.
[240:14.96]Where do I fall to?
[240:25.36]This way?
[240:25.66]Yep, this way.
[240:33.02]I hear one of those bugs.
[240:36.58]Keep going.
[240:42.16]Where's this bug?
[240:42.92]He's already gone.
[240:44.12]I don't know, is he?
[240:46.97]No, that's not a bug.
[240:47.69]That's just that... That's an audio file that's playing.
[240:50.87]Alright, there's Seath of the Scaleless 1.
[240:52.47]Seath of the Scaleless 2.
[240:53.75]Seath of the Scaleless 3.
[240:56.48]They're all down there.
[241:03.32]Shit.
[241:03.74]I can't get that item.
[241:04.58]Oh well.
[241:05.08]Who cares?
[241:05.52]I don't need any more items.
[241:08.28]I'm so jacked up already and I don't even need it.
[241:19.52]What are you doing down here?
[241:21.54]Did you actually come all the way down here to kill me?
[241:25.02]Determined.
[241:26.96]All right.
[241:28.50]All right.
[241:58.29]Alright, let's go.
[242:08.33]Can I not hurt him?
[242:14.37]I can't hurt him.
[242:15.07]Oh, I'm doing 11 damage to him.
[242:20.35]Fuck, man.
[242:21.07]Okay, well.
[242:21.91]I can hide in the little cave over here.
[242:33.61]Will he walk over here?
[242:34.35]I think I can get him to come over here.
[242:46.77]What is with this?
[242:47.31]Is this like a developer bug?
[243:04.86]What do I just do?
[243:05.44]There's one down there.
[243:35.51]Why did I throw a knife at this fucking thing?
[243:44.42]Don't even tell me this is one of these scenarios.
[243:47.06]Okay, let me tell you something.
[243:48.60]Yeah, oh yeah, watch this.
[243:50.60]Mm-hmm.
[243:51.38]Path ahead.
[243:51.96]Okay, yep, I get it now.
[243:53.88]Look at the snowflakes.
[243:56.76]I have to follow the snowflakes.
[243:58.36]Otherwise, I fall off the invisible... And here comes the dragon.
[244:01.31]Look at that.
[244:01.65]Look at the snowflakes.
[244:05.22]They light up when they hit the ground.
[244:09.74]Come on, where are my snowflakes?
[244:12.58]Where are my snowflakes?
[244:21.49]Just walk to the snowflakes and you'll be safe.
[244:34.21]I did it.
[244:37.95]That thing's still coming at me.
[244:39.57]No, it's stuck over there.
[244:40.69]Alright, hold on.
[244:41.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[244:41.57]Is there anything?
[244:42.05]There's one of these golden... One of these buttered popcorn enemies.
[244:56.09]Oh, fuck.
[244:56.61]Don't knock me off.
[244:58.11]I wish I could see.
[244:59.43]Ah!
[245:04.56]Easy.
[245:05.00]Easy.
[245:05.24]Don't dive.
[245:05.94]Don't dive.
[245:06.34]Don't dive.
[245:06.66]Don't.
[245:07.14]I know.
[245:07.42]I know.
[245:07.80]I know.
[245:08.12]I know.
[245:08.68]I know.
[245:09.10]I know.
[245:09.60]I know what you're gonna say.
[245:10.38]You're gonna say block with the... Oh, fuck.
[245:16.18]I'm panicking.
[245:32.15]I'm still alive.
[245:37.82]Is the lady going to pop out again?
[245:38.84]Alright, hold on.
[245:45.71]Down to the end.
[245:46.73]No, no, no.
[245:47.41]I can't fight it.
[245:48.05]I can't fight it.
[245:48.53]It's pushing me off.
[245:49.19]It's pushing me off.
[245:49.79]It's pushing me down.
[245:54.66]Right there.
[246:16.28]Oh, this sucks.
[246:23.22]Aye, aye, aye.
[246:31.66]At least it's right here.
[246:34.49]I don't have to go that far.
[246:35.73]And I know the way the first one is.
[246:48.69]Is chat disabled?
[246:49.81]Uh, it shouldn't be.
[246:51.79]Should be able to talk.
[246:53.40]I can see you guys talking.
[247:00.68]I'm sorry.
[247:01.10]I need to be able to see.
[247:01.94]I just, come on.
[247:03.07]Like, I can't.
[247:04.23]I can't do that right now.
[247:06.19]Not in the please be able to see where you're going level.
[247:20.13]Ooh, but now that I have that information, I can go over here.
[247:22.51]Just humanity, that's it, man.
[247:32.13]Oh, boy.
[247:32.55]Okay, we're fine.
[247:34.15]There it is.
[247:42.09]Man betrays 3,000 people.
[247:44.07]No, I didn't.
[247:44.55]I didn't betray anybody.
[247:45.44]But be careful here because I could just walk off.
[247:48.32]I need to take this very slow.
[247:52.81]Because I don't know how thin this is.
[247:55.23]This could be like a noodle.
[247:57.73]And I wouldn't know.
[247:58.33]I don't know how thick it is.
[248:03.92]I don't know if it zigzags, which it might.
[248:06.30]I don't trust it at all.
[248:09.28]At least we got the souls back.
[248:14.72]Okay.
[248:15.74]Trying this again.
[248:19.69]It's safe right here.
[248:22.67]But where is it also safe?
[248:25.32]To the left?
[248:27.32]Come on, drop.
[248:35.68]Right there.
[248:39.22]Right here?
[248:40.06]Okay, here.
[248:42.50]Just follow the crumbs.
[248:46.24]Okay, right here.
[248:48.45]I don't see any more crumbs falling.
[249:00.12]Come on.
[249:10.08]This is so stressful.
[249:11.06]I hate this.
[249:12.77]Right there.
[249:13.13]Right here.
[249:14.67]Right here.
[249:17.65]And then, I don't know.
[249:18.41]Can I go just right there?
[249:20.87]Right there.
[249:21.57]And we made it.
[249:22.57]Okay.
[249:23.97]It's another one of these stupid crystal golems.
[249:58.20]Wait, no!
[249:59.36]What?
[250:02.58]Why?
[250:03.12]What the fuck?
[250:04.26]It's so narrow.
[250:05.84]How are you supposed to do that?
[250:08.44]You... That's so narrow.
[250:11.84]I have to tightrope walk and fight that guy?
[250:13.92]I hope he's not there again.
[250:15.12]He is... He's dead.
[250:20.48]I... I'm... Oh.
[250:31.16]Which room am I going in?
[250:33.80]This one.
[250:39.72]If you take a step to the left or the right, you fall off that.
[250:46.39]What were they thinking?
[250:50.71]What were they thinking?
[250:54.73]Why is half this game invisible or pitch black?
[251:05.60]Put down prism stones?
[251:10.76]Where am I going right now?
[251:12.02]I'm just so... That's so... Easy!
[251:22.18]They have an entire item that was designed for this area.
[251:27.60]So, I think I only have one prism stone.
[251:32.00]Does it stay there permanently?
[251:47.95]That guy comes up behind me, I swear to God.
[251:49.57]You're gonna see me scream.
[251:51.37]Alright, Prism Stone.
[251:53.19]21.
[251:56.56]Let's start it.
[252:04.40]Oh, fuck.
[252:07.00]I mean, there already are Prism Stones here.
[252:10.07]They just don't cost a Prism Stone.
[252:11.83]Alright, then right there.
[252:17.11]No, don't fo- no, no, no, don't- don't- this is not gonna work.
[252:19.75]Is that correct?
[252:20.51]Yes.
[252:21.76]And then from here... I'm gonna make myself a wrong path, guys, and I'm gonna run down it and die.
[252:26.70]Okay.
[252:39.34]Looking good.
[252:40.98]Again.
[252:51.36]Alright, it's right here.
[252:55.49]Make sure I know that it's right here, like start from there.
[253:21.10]Hopefully this is correct.
[253:29.31]There we go.
[253:30.68]It's correct.
[253:31.18]Let me just drop one more here.
[253:32.42]Alright.
[253:35.08]We're safe.
[253:36.16]Get my souls.
[253:39.47]Everyone's safe.
[253:47.86]I hate this place.
[253:49.80]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[253:52.86]Oh my god.
[253:53.90]Oh my god.
[254:05.97]At least I know where to go.
[254:07.77]At least I have a path there.
[254:09.79]That's correct.
[254:21.96]I got my stones.
[254:34.41]Okay.
[254:35.87]Down we go.
[254:42.21]Don't rush because I'm annoyed at this.
[254:44.05]Alright.
[254:51.17]Let's do it again.
[255:00.90]Alright, well, guess what?
[255:01.78]The stones aren't even there.
[255:02.88]So, I'm glad I did that and died.
[255:05.76]That's fantastic.
[255:06.80]So, just fucking Hail Mary.
[255:09.52]I don't even care.
[255:10.08]Go.
[255:14.64]It's just a straight line.
[255:20.37]And it's a straight line because that's where I fell off.
[255:22.21]So, it's a straight line right from here.
[255:24.45]I'm so paranoid, though.
[255:26.57]Straight line.
[255:27.33]Got it.
[255:27.79]Go.
[255:27.89]Go.
[255:35.74]Okay, now excuse me for a second here.
[255:39.80]Excuse me.
[255:40.50]Like... Why is it like this?
[255:56.68]Where's the next path?
[256:23.71]What the fuck?
[256:34.84]What?
[256:41.11]Did I go down the wrong path?
[257:04.91]Is there another way to go from here?
[257:16.65]Can I go that way?
[257:24.53]There's nothing else there.
[257:25.55]Uh...
[257:38.72]Wait, what's that?
[257:39.84]What is that over there?
[257:45.42]Down and then over the... I... I don't know where I am.
[257:52.78]I know the crystals create a path, but down here, there ain't anywhere else to go.
[257:59.72]Because they're not hitting anything over there.
[258:05.64]They're hitting them down there, but not over here.
[258:12.98]I mean, I've been looking at the snow the whole time.
[258:21.43]Like, this just brings me back to where... Can I just go down that?
[258:24.29]This is bringing me back to where I was.
[258:26.03]Do I have to go down here?
[258:36.08]No, no, no, no!
[258:39.98]Okay.
[258:40.12]Okay.
[258:43.00]There's another one of those markers right there.
[258:44.76]That means, like, I can stand on this.
[258:49.18]That means I can stand on that.
[258:56.16]Imminent fall.
[259:07.68]Um... I can't go that way.
[259:09.88]Are we just going straight here?
[259:16.52]This is just a straight line, I think, right?
[259:20.99]I don't know.
[259:21.65]They'll throw a curveball at me and it won't be a straight line.
[259:26.41]Watch it.
[259:26.79]Watch it be true.
[259:28.81]I just gotta get to there.
[259:29.67]Watch it be true, guys.
[259:30.97]I'm telling you it's gonna be true.
[259:34.61]Thank God.
[259:36.59]Alright, give me a bonfire down here, please.
[259:39.30]Give me anything down here.
[259:45.79]I will take anything.
[259:48.19]A bonfire.
[259:49.95]Why is he standing up?
[259:51.87]I thought they only stand up if you attack them.
[260:09.51]Well, I better kill him first try.
[260:22.51]What was that quick attack?
[260:23.67]I haven't seen you do that before.
[260:24.75]I thought he already did the move.
[260:39.57]You know what?
[260:40.01]Fucking get away from me.
[260:44.81]Why am I even fighting these guys?
[260:46.83]He sounds so defeated.
[260:48.75]I'm just so paranoid that I'm gonna have to do another invisible walkway.
[260:52.79]Oh, fuck.
[261:06.77]Oh my god, why are there so many of these?
[261:31.45]Get out of the way.
[261:32.15]Why are you all still in the way?
[261:33.17]Okay.
[261:42.43]Anything else in here?
[261:44.17]Oh, I got more titanite.
[261:45.05]That's good.
[261:45.93]I'm never going to use it.
[261:51.81]All right.
[261:52.31]There's a big twinkling thing in the distance.
[261:55.91]Is that like Seath's back pain?
[262:00.09]Do I stick a sword into Seath's back or something?
[262:05.65]It has to be, right?
[262:10.64]This is like the back of Seath and I stick the sword to his back.
[262:13.44]Oh, no.
[262:14.46]No, it's just a boss fight.
[262:15.38]Alright, I gotta beat him first try here.
[262:30.53]He heard the sound.
[262:31.37]Now he's coming up here.
[262:34.29]His home security system went off.
[262:38.44]Just want to let you know I'm armed.
[262:40.72]You better leave.
[262:41.44]Okay.
[262:47.76]He's fucking huge.
[262:52.91]Boy.
[262:56.97]Well, he just healed 100% of that.
[263:00.21]What the fuck was that?
[263:04.44]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[263:05.38]I gotta get his back pain.
[263:06.20]Back pain.
[263:06.60]Get his back pain.
[263:07.16]Seath's back pain.
[263:08.00]Kill it.
[263:09.62]I have to hit Seath's back pain.
[263:13.82]Why would they focus on that so hard if that's not what you have to do?
[263:16.36]I. I'm gonna cut his Achilles tendon here.
[263:19.88]Got it.
[263:22.89]I knew it.
[263:23.37]I knew it.
[263:24.03]Why would they just focus on that?
[263:25.23]For what reason?
[263:27.89]He doesn't grow a new one, does he?
[263:30.72]No, we're good.
[263:32.60]What does this mean?
[263:34.29]I'm gonna die if I'm in here.
[263:58.54]What about this, like, egg sack back here?
[263:59.78]Does it hurt more?
[264:02.91]What am I... What the fuck are you doing?
[264:04.17]Just do it the right way.
[264:05.31]Do it the way you were just doing it.
[264:16.46]I just broke a crystal.
[264:18.68]Alright, I don't like being back here.
[264:19.66]No, I gotta get... This is like impossible.
[264:21.70]I gotta be in front of him.
[264:22.46]Like he just fucking flails around.
[264:24.00]Don't stay behind him.
[264:25.50]Let him bait out the stupid crystal beam.
[264:27.97]And then hit him right in his like hamster balls.
[264:45.43]Whoa!
[264:48.34]What do you do about that?
[264:51.00]What do you do about this?
[264:51.84]You just have to survive it?
[265:05.13]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[265:05.79]Don't do the hamster ball thing again.
[265:09.19]Oh, boy.
[265:09.55]Okay.
[265:09.93]Rightly exact.
[265:11.87]It does more damage.
[265:12.47]It does more damage.
[265:13.69]Last hit.
[265:14.11]Come on.
[265:14.67]Die.
[265:15.01]I did it.
[265:16.85]Okay.
[265:17.07]That was not bad.
[265:21.21]Fuck off, buddy.
[265:26.03]Bequeathed Lord Soul Shard.
[265:33.39]And like, probably like 100,000 souls.
[265:36.08]Just about, yeah.
[265:40.16]Missed his tail.
[265:41.70]He didn't, he had a tail?
[265:42.86]He had like a crystal up his ass.
[265:50.91]Oh, no.
[265:51.25]We're past 90, though.
[265:52.76]I can't do past 90.
[265:55.60]I gotta stay at 90.
[265:56.10]Fuck it.
[266:00.24]Who cares?
[266:08.57]91 for all I care.
[266:12.23]Alright.
[266:13.79]It's time to... This is it, right?
[266:17.62]I'm at the end of the game.
[266:18.76]It's time to beat the game.
[266:22.52]We're going back to... It's time to finish the game.
[266:35.73]Is there anything else that I missed?
[266:38.13]Did all the DLC... Let's warp to Firelink.
[266:53.09]I have to kill the boob lady.
[266:56.11]Kill giant lady.
[266:57.02]Okay.
[267:01.12]I'll go throw a knife at the giant lady.
[267:10.35]She's in here, right?
[267:16.37]Strength soft caps at 40.
[267:17.57]Yeah, but I was probably going to get the smog hammer for PvP.
[267:23.33]Okay, so... Everyone is telling me, okay, so let's throw a knife at her.
[267:29.05]Hold on, first let me, like, show her my fucking cool stuff I found at the beach.
[267:37.16]How about the green one?
[267:37.78]You can have the yellow one.
[267:43.24]Uh, what the f- I swear to God.
[267:50.19]This controller is so fucked up.
[267:52.50]It's gonna give me... Okay, I selected it.
[267:56.96]Good.
[267:57.34]Nice job.
[267:59.66]Uh, throwing knife.
[268:03.26]Alright, let's throw the knife at her.
[268:17.33]So this just is an optional boss fight.
[268:19.75]Okay.
[268:20.81]Whatever you say lady.
[268:24.48]Oh.
[268:24.64]It got real dark.
[268:51.66]What do you mean nobody correct him?
[269:12.21]I thought you guys said there was a boss here.
[269:21.00]There's just a giant makeup mirror.
[269:33.03]Look for the boss.
[269:34.23]Is it just in this room?
[269:35.15]Is there just a boss walking around?
[269:41.12]I hear something.
[270:01.65]Alright, people are telling me to go to the Darkmoon Tomb.
[270:18.64]Okay.
[270:31.13]You've enraged the dark moons.
[270:36.64]Alright, you know what, I'll just kinda hang out around here.
[270:38.68]Invisible, uh, invisible walkway?
[271:05.73]Oh look!
[271:06.79]There's a boss door!
[271:10.41]And there's four one-up mushrooms!
[271:16.45]I can die four times here.
[271:21.30]First thou offended the godmother, and now thou seek fit to trample upon the tomb of the great lord.
[271:33.48]Good one.
[271:35.20]Whatever.
[271:39.67]I'm ready.
[271:40.51]Okay, so is this like a fun house?
[271:47.45]Dark Sun Gwyndolin.
[271:49.03]Oh, you're just right there.
[271:50.17]You're not there anymore.
[271:53.42]Okay.
[271:57.76]Here is half the Bloodborne boss's music.
[272:02.40]Alright, well, you obviously are a caster.
[272:08.70]That hurts.
[272:13.59]Oh boy, that does hurt.
[272:14.43]Can I... Oh, you can't get away from that, it seems.
[272:20.51]No, you can't.
[272:21.07]That goes through everything.
[272:23.07]They thought about this.
[272:32.61]What?
[272:32.75]Am I supposed to just keep going?
[272:35.85]Oh, god damn it.
[272:40.48]This is not fair.
[272:41.36]Okay.
[272:48.22]Well, it looks like you have to just get there quick.
[272:58.99]The thing, the bonfire is right here.
[273:04.31]No.
[273:04.95]Ah, Jeremy.
[273:10.46]Wait, what?
[273:14.32]What?
[273:15.32]Why did I end up here?
[273:15.98]Did I not sit at the... I didn't rest at this, did I?
[273:20.00]Okay, that was weird.
[273:24.68]The whole place is dark, man.
[273:35.64]Walk around Anor Londo first.
[273:37.92]Do you want me to just take a look?
[273:38.82]Alright, I'll take a look at the night sky, and then I'm gonna go bury my sword in Gwyndolin's head.
[273:52.83]One guy said that.
[273:53.67]I know.
[273:54.55]I told you already.
[273:55.61]One day you're gonna be the one guy.
[274:00.09]I can hear something, so I wanna see.
[274:04.64]Let's just take a gander.
[274:14.98]Nice, okay, cool.
[274:18.12]Okay, nice.
[274:36.87]Oh my god, I'm sweating in here, man.
[274:38.71]I'm like dying in this room.
[274:40.65]I don't have any air conditioning down here.
[274:42.15]I'm being like fucking smoked out.
[274:49.24]Ugh.
[274:55.04]Let's go.
[274:58.38]I'm gonna take off some stuff here because I feel like the dodging needs to be dodgeable.
[275:03.75]The stuff you need to dodge around.
[275:06.26]And this is magic, so I can skip it.
[275:08.74]We're going to put on some magic defense.
[275:11.94]Magic defense.
[275:12.70]17.
[275:12.72]15.
[275:12.84]Feed him naked.
[275:14.47]No, I want to win, guys.
[275:15.45]I'm playing to win.
[275:29.17]magic 22 34 I don't want a fat roll though I want a super fun loop-de-loop roll all right we got that 22 that's fine and try to get this 19 29 look at that 35 all right gwendoline v gwendoline let's go
[275:56.98]I was about to do the one-up mushroom thing again, but why would I do that?
[275:59.44]All right, let's go.
[276:03.32]Run straight.
[276:09.17]Just dodge around.
[276:10.07]Here comes like the floaties.
[276:13.55]Whoa, no, you're throwing knives now.
[276:15.69]Where'd you learn that?
[276:21.41]Like that dodge?
[276:26.41]Oh my god, she's almost dead.
[276:29.33]Alright, just gotta do that one more time.
[276:31.05]Ooh!
[276:35.02]No, wait, please!
[276:57.83]Why does it keep putting me here?
[277:11.77]I think this calls for a little bit of an equalizer here.
[277:23.78]Doesn't matter.
[277:30.42]No, no, no, no.
[277:31.44]I had it.
[277:31.84]I just need to not get hit.
[277:34.10]The strategy was fine.
[277:48.20]Oh my fucking god.
[277:48.96]Hold on, wait.
[277:49.44]It's not a girl.
[277:51.58]Gwendolyn.
[277:56.02]The good witch... Gwendolyn?
[277:56.74]Gwen?
[278:07.36]Okay.
[278:14.95]No, that Dark Sun Gwendolyn, that doesn't matter.
[278:17.05]That's S-U-N, not S-O-N.
[278:27.71]Oh my fucking god.
[278:34.71]Ew, man.
[278:35.99]Honest to God.
[278:42.91]I had to just dodge through them all.
[278:49.42]Like that.
[278:49.86]Well, that sucked.
[278:57.00]Knives?
[278:57.36]They don't even pick up the souls.
[279:02.26]What the fuck am I even picking them up for?
[279:10.54]All right, literally one more time, and I'm done.
[279:12.40]Oh, you cannot.
[279:30.83]Made it.
[279:45.16]Alright.
[279:47.16]Soul of Gwendolyn.
[279:54.95]That deserves a drink!
[279:58.71]That just gave me 40,000 souls.
[279:59.75]Did that just change this whole area?
[280:19.95]Huh.
[280:22.67]Sunlight Blade is a miracle.
[280:24.39]Nothing else.
[280:28.87]Cool.
[280:30.69]Wait a minute, there's something else here too.
[280:35.11]Brass Armor.
[280:36.11]Alright, I think it's time for us to get Smog's Hammer.
[280:42.55]I need to beat the boss.
[280:43.67]I gotta beat the last boss with the fucking cartoon setup, right?
[280:50.62]Empty?
[280:51.86]Empty?
[280:52.12]Are you serious, dude?
[280:57.12]Unbelievable.
[281:02.91]Fucking empty.
[281:05.27]Some godly family heirloom treasure you have there.
[281:11.23]Disgusting.
[281:12.07]Absolutely disgusting.
[281:12.93]That's the only empty chest in the whole game.
[281:22.72]Alright, let's... Let's go beat the game.
[281:28.39]But I have to be in the stupid setup.
[281:30.73]So... I need to get the club here.
[281:34.35]I have it plus six.
[281:37.75]Who can... Who can get this to... It doesn't... As long as you get any item to plus ten, right?
[281:46.33]Any striking item.
[281:47.28]So I can get the club to plus ten, right?
[281:50.92]I have the soulless mug.
[281:53.59]Let's go to Undead Parish.
[282:00.21]Or is it the giant?
[282:04.21]Do I need to get the plus 10 from the giant or plus 10 from Andre?
[282:13.42]Either one.
[282:13.72]Well, I know exactly where he is, so... Andre the giant.
[282:20.75]Alright, so if I go to... Where... If Anor Londo... Where's the fastest way to get to... The giant blacksmith?
[282:28.64]I'm trying to remember.
[282:29.24]He's actually from where I just was.
[282:54.55]Okay, so up the stairs.
[282:59.15]Now it's dark here.
[283:00.76]It's pitch black.
[283:08.04]Right above the bonfire.
[283:11.60]I can't just get through here?
[283:13.10]Up the elevator or something?
[283:18.79]Put on Cookie Monster?
[283:19.71]I know, we're gonna do like the stupid jokey setup, don't worry.
[283:25.87]Where do I go from here?
[283:30.00]Wrong bonfire.
[283:31.10]Everyone told me to go to this one.
[283:35.68]Change armor?
[283:36.58]Don't worry, we're going to change the armor.
[283:42.66]I did this.
[283:43.18]I don't think this is the correct one.
[283:48.59]It is the right bonfire.
[283:57.06]Should I go down?
[283:57.72]I'm looking for like a staircase.
[284:19.99]Am I going the right way here?
[284:37.31]And then up here.
[284:39.60]This place is so different during the night.
[284:49.56]I haven't been here in a long time.
[284:56.05]Come here.
[284:56.45]Oh, please.
[285:08.99]Can I not parry this?
[285:11.66]I don't think I can.
[285:12.56]I've just tried.
[285:13.18]I can.
[285:28.63]Please fight me on the fucking staircase, dude.
[285:30.37]Alright, move out of the way.
[285:39.48]If I go down straight through, he's going to be like right there.
[285:43.79]Isn't he straight through here?
[285:55.85]He's like outside.
[285:56.93]Oh, wait a minute.
[285:59.80]Yeah, it's right here.
[286:07.13]Why is everybody telling me I'm wrong?
[286:08.67]That was like the fastest way I could have gotten there from where I was standing.
[286:19.50]Shiny.
[286:21.06]Yes, you can have the ember.
[286:27.16]Wrong, wrong.
[286:28.62]All right, reinforce weapon, get the club to plus 10.
[286:34.54]I have enough to do this, right?
[286:37.61]I'm not sure I have enough to do this.
[286:41.05]No, I need another Titanite shard.
[286:42.79]Does he sell them?
[286:45.93]Thank God he does.
[286:56.10]Plus nine.
[286:58.16]Three more of these.
[287:09.27]Alright, plus 10.
[287:11.01]Reinforce now.
[287:13.23]Modify equipment.
[287:15.49]Lightning club smogs hammer.
[287:18.73]Requires 5,000 in the soul of smog.
[287:25.51]And then I'm going to upgrade this as far as I can.
[287:32.56]Are you ready?
[287:42.04]There it is.
[287:43.16]Uh, Demon Titanite.
[287:44.26]I can do Smog's Hammer 1.
[287:47.99]Smog's Hammer 2.
[287:51.15]I need more Demon Titanite.
[287:58.03]Don't ask me where the hell I'm supposed to get that.
[287:59.71]Let's see how it looks.
[288:11.81]532 smogs.
[288:13.25]Great hammer.
[288:13.93]Where are you?
[288:15.45]Went by it.
[288:15.95]380.
[288:15.97]360.
[288:15.99]58 strength.
[288:24.92]Oh my god.
[288:36.12]Damage doesn't even compare, but we're doing it for like the joke.
[288:39.40]Oh my fucking lord.
[288:40.56]Are you serious?
[288:46.24]Oh, you can do actually like the Tom and Jerry smash?
[288:53.79]All right.
[288:55.75]Well, I might as well put on the other thing that makes my view terrible.
[289:06.60]Is this how we're going to beat Gwyn?
[289:11.69]How heavy is this?
[289:12.33]Alright, even with the ring... Alright, let's go... I'm assuming... Gwyn is probably fire.
[289:20.55]So, let's see.
[289:21.53]I want to put on my... Well, I'm going to be like a cartoon character.
[289:26.59]So I have to have him on the helmet.
[289:32.23]Yeah, we have to go back to the cartoon.
[289:33.73]So that's the Katarina armor.
[289:39.08]This thing.
[289:39.54]I need, like, fucking funny hands I can have on.
[289:49.52]I don't want to go, uh, past... I'll put the stone gauntlets on.
[289:53.62]Okay.
[289:55.01]Okay.
[290:01.32]So funny, I'm literally shaking.
[290:04.86]I'm glad you think it's that funny.
[290:06.60]That makes me happy.
[290:08.02]I'm glad you think it's funny.
[290:13.33]I mean, this is pretty good.
[290:14.87]This is a Gwyn killer, I think.
[290:16.61]Alright.
[290:21.87]Let's try it.
[290:22.95]Let's beat the game.
[290:23.57]This is only a plus three smogs hammer, so whatever.
[290:32.62]It's so goofy looking.
[290:33.96]Oh my god.
[290:34.54]Alright, what about... No, I like having... No.
[290:48.72]No pants.
[290:49.24]Fuck it.
[290:49.48]We're going to beat him like this.
[290:50.38]Alright, it's time to go back to Firelink and complete the video game.
[291:01.74]Should I just hold R2 on the giant?
[291:03.24]What do you think?
[291:11.42]Alright, let's just go back.
[291:12.92]Bone, I'm just going to use it just because.
[291:19.40]Jesus Christ.
[291:21.40]Did I go buy it?
[291:26.12]Have I defeated the four kings?
[291:27.14]Yes, I have.
[291:35.35]I'm pretty sure everybody's dead.
[291:45.78]Alright, we're at Firelink.
[291:47.12]Rest here.
[291:48.06]Let's go talk to Frampt.
[291:55.49]This hammer is really so much in the way that it's actually hard... Whatever.
[291:59.39]I'm not going to complain about it.
[292:00.19]I have to beat the game with the hammer.
[292:02.51]Hey, you!
[292:03.37]I did everything you asked me to do.
[292:08.16]Hello?
[292:14.36]What's going on?
[292:14.82]Do I have to, like, make noise?
[292:17.71]No, I'm not gonna hit him.
[292:27.13]I'm not gonna hit him!
[292:31.25]What the fuck?
[292:33.35]Smash his head.
[292:34.15]I'm not gonna smash his head.
[292:42.07]I have to hit him?
[292:53.84]Okay.
[292:55.46]Alright.
[293:07.34]I'm ready.
[293:10.94]Yes, I'm ready to... I'm ready to go.
[293:20.61]No, I don't want the smog armor.
[293:33.25]That's for playthrough number four.
[293:37.84]I'm gonna beat the game right now.
[293:47.87]You have done it.
[293:49.11]Place the Lordvessel on the canister.
[293:53.09]And then take your rightful place after Gwyn.
[293:56.85]Alright, offer souls to the Lordvessel.
[294:08.60]Blow out your birthday candles.
[294:27.08]It looks like the hammer is inside the chest.
[294:35.81]all right here we are reinforce armor okay let's level I'm gonna level up the helmet where is it where's I don't give a anymore you think anything matters from here on out where is it where is it can I not level up the mask
[295:13.53]Why?
[295:16.51]Sack?
[295:19.43]It was at the bottom.
[295:20.25]I don't see it anywhere.
[295:20.93]I passed it?
[295:27.60]No, I didn't.
[295:30.82]So it can't be leveled up.
[295:56.23]Why did I do that?
[295:56.89]Uh.
[296:29.97]Now I have to wear it.
[296:30.97]Okay.
[296:33.09]So much waste.
[296:33.85]Well, we're done here anyways.
[296:38.19]Yeah, now I have to wear it.
[296:39.15]You're right.
[296:41.39]Plus five.
[296:43.03]It's so fucking in the way.
[296:46.18]I'm not going to be able to even see the bots.
[296:52.82]Who the fuck are these guys?
[296:53.78]Are they enemies?
[297:01.04]Is there a new area here, or do I just have to fight him?
[297:06.30]Kiln of the First Flame.
[297:13.19]The only way to fight Gwyn.
[297:14.45]These are like Black Knights.
[297:20.69]I can't even see him attack!
[297:43.67]Get cartoon smashed!
[297:44.87]It's cartoon, cartoon.
[297:47.37]I have 20 Estuses.
[297:56.22]Okay.
[298:02.56]I really wish I had this at plus 4 or plus 5, but whatever.
[298:07.57]How's my dodging?
[298:08.15]Am I fat rolling?
[298:09.43]No.
[298:10.39]I'm just mid-rolling, but whatever.
[298:11.63]I have Smog's Hammer on.
[298:17.13]Oops.
[298:17.85]Let's try to... Let's blind parry this guy.
[298:22.55]Oh my fucking god.
[298:30.37]It's not fucking possible.
[298:39.22]Uh...
[298:45.65]What about... Oh, yeah.
[298:46.45]Upgrade the shield.
[298:47.31]I forgot.
[298:47.79]I don't have any more souls.
[298:52.95]I can't do it.
[299:00.36]Am I gonna beat the... I mean, you have to assume the final boss is probably gonna be fairly difficult.
[299:12.80]Is it even gonna be humanly possible for me to do this?
[299:26.62]He can be parried.
[299:27.38]Well, good thing I got a good parry view.
[299:30.52]I can't even parry.
[299:31.71]I have to just guess when he's going to swing.
[299:33.51]This thing is fucking awesome.
[299:42.87]This thing is awesome.
[299:43.91]Why did I not play with this before?
[299:47.28]That was the biggest mistake of this entire playthrough.
[299:52.40]Like, what an absolute blunder that was.
[300:00.73]Really?
[300:12.31]That's a weird recovery move.
[300:26.63]Did these guys drop Demon Titanite?
[300:36.66]Now imagine if this was plus five.
[300:38.04]That would be probably seven or eight hundred damage, wouldn't it?
[300:40.98]It'd be at least six or seven hundred damage.
[300:44.48]I can go up here.
[300:45.14]Hold on.
[300:49.63]Anything up here?
[300:53.19]Doesn't look like it.
[300:54.41]Oh, how?
[300:55.05]This is so painful.
[300:58.50]This playing with this thing, man.
[301:01.10]It's giving me anxiety.
[301:02.48]I'm not kidding.
[301:03.15]It is.
[301:04.21]Is anybody else getting fucking anxiety?
[301:05.83]And you're not even playing the game.
[301:07.63]I almost just fell off.
[301:14.16]Alright, here we go.
[301:25.41]That's the follow-up.
[301:26.77]So it's an R2 into an R1.
[301:36.59]Oh, there's the whole Black Knight set.
[301:39.05]It only took till the end of the game to get it.
[301:47.06]Anybody else up there?
[301:47.92]Okay, here we go.
[301:58.94]There's the entrance.
[302:00.60]Alright, here we go.
[302:01.64]I'm actually going to fight Gwyn.
[302:06.01]I've called every last boss in Dark Souls games Gwyn.
[302:09.43]I'm about to fight the real guy.
[302:10.37]I'm kind of like starstruck right now.
[302:20.05]That was Black Knight's shield.
[302:25.20]Turn the music up?
[302:26.34]Alright, fine.
[302:29.53]Does he get good music?
[302:30.44]Alright, let's go.
[302:36.42]No, there's another one of these guys.
[302:39.86]Oh, really?
[302:40.32]You just fucked it up for me.
[302:54.45]I'm not gonna play the Mario slide music.
[302:56.97]I'm gonna beat Gwynn.
[303:04.35]Alright, I'm ready.
[303:06.91]I gotta beat Dark Souls on stream!
[303:09.01]Gwyn, the Lord of Hatred!
[303:18.42]I did it!
[303:19.06]We both did- We both ran into each other at the same time!
[303:30.56]Come on, Gwyn!
[303:57.32]No no no no no back up
[304:43.08]It's working!
[304:44.28]I'm actually gonna beat him.
[304:51.84]Easy, easy.
[304:52.32]Get away from the fucking side there.
[304:55.51]Come on, Gwyn!
[305:03.49]Oh, shit.
[305:09.06]Oh, shit.
[305:16.24]I'm going for like the cartoon finish and I gotta stop doing that!
[305:36.59]Do it for the fu- Okay, I'll get the funny ending, here we go.
[305:40.31]I took off the fucking shield.
[305:42.53]Oh my god, I'm one-handing this.
[305:44.56]Put it on two hands, you fucking dumbass.
[305:49.29]Cartoon finish, here we go.
[306:10.37]Come on, Gwen!
[306:24.06]Oh, that was so funny.
[306:25.38]I did the funny car- I did- Wouldn't that- Everyone thinks that was funny, right?
[306:40.89]Oh, that was so funny.
[306:45.20]Get this shit off me before I throw up.
[306:52.16]Okay.
[306:54.02]Link the fire.
[306:56.78]Or maybe not link.
[306:57.94]Maybe I don't link the fire.
[306:59.96]Isn't there a choice?
[307:05.94]No, I refuse.
[307:37.47]What?
[307:37.79]I'm the new king, right?
[307:52.14]Well, there sure are a lot of Framps.
[308:06.63]Bad good guy ending?
[308:07.95]Well, there it is.
[308:08.98]Dark Souls Remastered is over.
[308:20.80]I'm so glad that I did get to cartoon Gwyn, though.
[308:25.85]We got the cartoon end.
[308:31.45]There it is.
[308:31.83]It's over.
[308:35.55]And, first impressions?
[308:37.71]Okay, first impressions of completing the entire game.
[308:40.92]Uh, there you go.
[308:46.80]That was good.
[308:47.84]That was good.
[308:49.92]I will say a few things, though.
[308:51.24]I've got a few words.
[308:56.96]Well, now we're in New Game+.
[308:58.78]Why are we in New Game+, again?
[309:02.28]Yes, indeed.
[309:05.30]Okay, now I'm going to play until I die and I'm going to get to Quinn again.
[309:13.78]Here we go.
[309:24.42]Next run.
[309:28.68]If I take one hit, then the stream ends.
[309:42.95]I'm literally going to run to every boss until I die.
[309:54.04]I'm going to do this right.
[310:05.45]Let's level up, though.
[310:06.53]I can't even level up.
[310:10.24]I think somebody skipped $50.
[310:11.32]We had like multiple $50 donations.
[310:12.86]Hold on.
[310:14.34]Do I remember where the bosses are?
[310:15.56]I could, yeah.
[310:16.34]I'm going to kill at least the first two bosses.
[310:17.92]Watch this.
[310:21.98]Come on down.
[310:35.33]Come on.
[310:35.57]Go, go, go, go, go.
[310:36.37]Done.
[310:45.59]Where's the key?
[310:46.25]I gotta get the key!
[310:58.42]Oh yeah, I need my Estus flask that I apparently don't have yet.
[311:03.62]Fuck, game's over.
[311:04.96]No, we'll go until I die.
[311:06.10]Watch this.
[311:09.08]Can you even imagine?
[311:10.22]I'm gonna be completely real, right?
[311:13.02]How would you ever... How would you ever... do a no-hit 100% run of this game?
[311:20.11]How would you ever complete that?
[311:23.19]I don't understand the random stuff that the game makes you get hit by, you know what I mean?
[311:28.77]There's a ton of shit in this game that just forces you to take damage.
[311:38.96]Unreal patience.
[311:39.80]I can imagine.
[311:43.38]Okay, got it.
[311:44.68]Thank you very much.
[311:47.42]By the way, every NPC dies until I die.
[311:49.32]I don't even know if he dropped anything.
[311:54.28]I don't even care.
[312:01.38]It's impossible because of Seath.
[312:02.50]But wouldn't that be technically a one hit or something?
[312:06.34]Maybe you... I don't know.
[312:09.92]How does a speed run or how does a run do that?
[312:17.44]You can just skip that part.
[312:20.00]You can skip with a trick.
[312:21.46]Okay, interesting.
[312:27.55]Didn't even need to go up there.
[312:33.48]Right to the Taurus Demon.
[312:41.71]But not quite.
[312:42.43]Not quite.
[312:42.79]Not yet.
[312:54.40]Does he drop anything?
[313:15.08]Get the fuck out of here.
[313:21.27]This is a kill run.
[313:23.79]What do you get?
[313:26.03]What do you drop?
[313:32.94]Hurry up.
[313:35.58]I'm not going to pick up any items.
[313:45.05]We're running right to the Taurus demon.
[313:58.64]I'm going to fall off.
[313:59.64]No, I'm not.
[314:08.91]He's trying to relive Undertale.
[314:12.29]I'm not trying to do that.
[314:23.97]Whoa!
[314:24.55]What the fuck?
[314:26.19]What is... A dragon!
[314:27.43]Is there a dragon in this game?
[314:30.75]Oh, damn, man.
[314:31.99]I'm not kidding.
[314:45.76]I'm going until I die.
[315:00.48]One hand the ice cream?
[315:06.90]What are you still doing in Undead Parish?
[315:09.58]That's a good question.
[315:13.07]Trying to be a cool guy.
[315:16.23]Come on, kick it.
[315:16.81]I don't have all day.
[315:17.91]Doesn't matter, I can take the hit.
[315:23.73]No, no, not before I do something fun!
[315:48.70]Fun saved for now.
[316:06.86]Submit this run to speedrun chaos.
[316:08.92]What do you mean speedrun chaos?
[316:10.25]Come on, come on, come on!
[316:29.45]I've not got all day!
[317:02.14]Every NPC, sorry.
[317:03.44]Give me all your stuff, hurry up.
[317:25.19]You fool!
[317:28.09]Wear it?
[317:28.63]No, I have my own clothes.
[317:36.84]Wait, hold on.
[317:41.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[317:42.21]Where's the... Come on, this is supposed to be speedrun.
[317:44.65]Where's the thing I kicked down?
[318:01.77]Speedrunners don't need shortcuts.
[318:03.05]Well, some of them do.
[318:12.25]Speedrun, but you go back for health.
[318:16.13]Come on.
[318:17.87]I'm new at this.
[318:20.52]What's the split on that last one?
[318:45.01]Where is it?
[318:45.25]Where is it?
[318:45.71]Where is it?
[318:46.13]Where is it?
[318:46.51]Which one is it?
[318:47.01]Where is it?
[318:47.65]Where is it?
[318:47.97]Where is it?
[318:48.34]Where is it?
[318:48.62]Now that's double damage.
[318:49.42]Don't have time.
[319:39.32]What?
[320:19.86]Where is he?
[320:21.18]Alright, fuck it.
[320:21.62]I can't fight him.
[320:23.42]We have to fight somebody else.
[320:31.34]Alright.
[320:31.86]Gargoyles, right?
[320:34.22]Bring it on.
[320:34.50]Let's go.
[320:45.74]Put on the ice cream stick?
[320:46.56]Not right now.
[321:06.56]What do we know?
[321:07.77]I don't know what a gate skip is.
[321:08.93]Am I gonna die in the hollow room?
[321:24.48]No, I'm not.
[321:26.12]Don't say these things.
[321:27.18]They're not true.
[321:46.33]Going to the painting?
[321:48.34]No, not yet.
[322:08.83]Go to Quelaag first.
[322:11.89]Oh boy.
[322:12.77]Run over.
[322:13.37]Run ruined.
[322:13.91]It's over.
[322:18.68]Oh my fucking god.
[322:19.90]There's so many people there.
[322:43.28]There's no going back once you start skipping.
[322:44.84]Here we go.
[322:45.20]Alright, come on.
[322:55.02]I gotta kill this guy really quickly.
[323:03.23]Fuck!
[323:10.39]Oh god, I'm too panicky!
[323:20.82]Oh no!
[323:21.32]Oh no, it's over!
[323:30.59]I'm gonna die!
[323:32.25]No, I die on my own terms!
[323:39.70]I die on my own terms.
[323:50.76]I'm trying to end the fucking task.
[323:52.64]I can't... Okay, got it.
[323:56.14]That's as far as I got.
[324:05.85]Those are my terms.
[324:12.52]All right.
[324:13.66]That's it.
[324:15.02]There's $50 there.
[324:15.56]$50 like three times in a row.
[324:17.92]Jesus.
[324:24.27]Gargoyles.
[324:30.37]Well, Dark Souls was fun.
[324:32.11]Never played it before.
[324:32.91]I feel like I experienced most of it, did all the DLC.
[324:37.16]That was fun.
[324:40.62]And that's going to be it for tonight.
[324:42.76]Thanks for sticking around.
[324:44.50]We will PvP.
[324:47.22]Maybe, you know, let's just like get Dark Souls completely over with.
[324:51.81]I would say... I have a bunch of shit I have to do tomorrow.
[324:56.70]So there's not gonna be a stream tomorrow.
[324:58.50]There'll be a stream on Sunday.
[325:01.40]I have a family arrangement I have to go to and still getting the house ready.
[325:07.34]So Sunday afternoon, probably early, we'll do a Dark Souls Sunday PvP multiplayer extravaganza.
[325:16.67]Where for like, I don't know, like at least a few hours, we will just buck around, have some fun.
[325:24.61]Any chance of a rerun of Dark Souls 2 or Dark Souls 3?
[325:27.31]I don't think I would do Dark Souls 3 again.
[325:29.93]Because I streamed all of Dark Souls 3.
[325:32.59]And I actually even streamed a second character in Dark Souls 3.
[325:36.06]Remember the sorcery guy?
[325:37.80]Strictly sorcery.
[325:39.84]So I would never go back to Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[325:42.62]Dark Souls 2 maybe, but I'm not a big fan of Dark Souls 2.
[325:47.92]I played through Dark Souls 2 and all the Scholar, and I was like, eh.
[325:52.79]Like, that was fun, but I don't think I'd want to do it another, like, four or five times, so... I don't think the game sucks, but I think there's... I would rather do something else.
[326:06.14]But we'll figure that out at a later date, but Sunday, we'll do a just chill PvP multiplayer stream, and we'll be completely done with all of Dark Souls Remastered for the record there.
[326:18.25]So, thank you for sticking around.
[326:21.81]Let's do the credits here.
[326:26.51]Last final thoughts.
[326:27.43]You want me to place Dark Souls 1?
[326:30.44]I can do that.
[326:32.04]I would probably, it would look like this.
[326:34.32]It would look like, I think Bloodborne's still my number one.
[326:38.40]It just is.
[326:40.12]I think Bloodborne is my favorite of these games after playing through all of them now.
[326:45.48]uh hold on let me put on like the stream ending thing just for a moment yeah dark souls three it would be bloodborne dark souls three and demon souls would be one two three I'm it would be actually it would be dark souls one might be above demon souls for me
[327:12.82]So it really might... But Dark Souls 3, I'm not sure, should be up that high either.
[327:16.92]Honestly, this is going to sound crazy, but I really would do it like this.
[327:23.26]Bloodborne is the best.
[327:24.99]And then, like, all in second place would be Dark Souls 3, Demon's Souls, and Dark Souls 1.
[327:31.41]I can't place them above each other.
[327:36.37]I think I had more fun in Dark Souls 3 just because the game was newer.
[327:40.46]The mechanics are newer.
[327:44.67]Also, remember, I'm going backwards here.
[327:47.29]So Dark Souls 1 is the last one I've played in this entire series.
[327:59.34]Dark Souls 3 is smoother.
[328:00.48]It's a smoother experience.
[328:03.06]You complained constantly in Dark Souls 3?
[328:04.74]Oh, yeah, I know.
[328:06.60]And I did in Dark Souls 1.
[328:07.74]And I did in Dark Souls 2.
[328:08.80]And I did in Bloodborne.
[328:09.76]And I did in Demon's Souls.
[328:14.49]I really liked Demon's Souls.
[328:15.63]I really thought Demon's Souls had the best like setup for me.
[328:19.13]I like just that.
[328:20.68]Hey, here's five gravestones and you can go to any of them.
[328:24.88]You can go to world four.
[328:25.92]You can go to world five, five, one, two, one, two, three.
[328:29.02]The whole game is open from the beginning.
[328:30.80]I mean, you're going to get your ass kicked, but I like that setup.
[328:34.24]I like this just having a hub world and having things to teleport to and in any order you want to go in.
[328:45.54]After playing Dark Souls 1 and being turned off by the no warping, it was not as much of a big deal as I was thinking it was.
[328:57.24]Because once you figure out that that door just goes down there and that blind fire leads to that door, so it doesn't matter.
[329:02.81]You don't have to run very far.
[329:06.39]But I like the Bloodborne and Demon's Souls style of game more than I liked the Dark Souls style of game.
[329:14.95]There you go.
[329:16.53]They're all fantastic video games.
[329:18.13]I don't... Dark Souls 2 is just, hey, do you like Dark Souls?
[329:22.35]Well, I've got news for you.
[329:23.87]There are like 44 bosses in this game.
[329:26.71]Just, if you want more, play it.
[329:36.63]DLC-wise, I think I'm going to have to say Bloodborne is my favorite DLC.
[329:42.90]The Old Hunters was amazing.
[329:45.82]All the areas were so different.
[329:48.04]Some of those bosses are some of the most memorable encounters I've ever had in a game.
[329:51.23]The Old Hunters was the best for me.
[329:54.16]It's just so, it's so good.
[329:56.29]It's actually criminal that they haven't made that game 60 FPS with PS4 Pro or have not made it available to other people.
[330:03.91]Like PC or even Xbox.
[330:07.28]They really should just let that hammer go.
[330:09.30]Like just drop it, man.
[330:10.26]Like let everybody play.
[330:11.64]That's like such a fantastic fucking game.
[330:14.36]That is, it's just, come on, man.
[330:15.80]Like let other people enjoy like a masterpiece.
[330:17.97]Seriously.
[330:22.88]But with that, let's do the credits.
[330:24.50]There's my take on the series, I guess.
[330:31.83]Good thing Sekiro is not exclusive to anything.
[330:34.05]Yeah.
[330:39.73]Okay, so let's go here.
[330:41.69]Thank you, everybody, for the subs and the resubs.
[330:44.49]And there were a lot of big donations tonight.

[330:49.19]Don't worry.
[330:50.63]Thank you so much, everybody.

[334:06.25]Wrong button, dude.
[334:07.39]So yeah, I'll see you on Sunday.
[334:09.49]If you guys taken off.
[334:13.01]I don't even know how I subbed.
[334:17.21]I don't know.
[334:18.17]That sounds like a mystery.
[334:20.83]Now let's go back in time a little while ago.
[334:26.21]And I'm going to... It's like fucking sweltering in here.
[334:28.51]Let me just open up that window.
[334:30.54]Jesus, man.
[334:33.22]It's like 600 million degrees in here.
[334:38.72]And right when I do that, my loud-ass AC turns on.
[334:42.00]All right, well, whatever.
[334:44.02]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[334:46.18]I think you'll get a kick out of this video.
[334:52.79]Welcome to 2008.
[334:53.95]Thank you, Sir Feline.
[334:55.35]Appreciate it.
[334:57.05]Sir Feline, thanks again for the $1.
[334:58.41]I can't believe you fell for it.
[334:59.43]Thank you.
[335:04.55]Thank you.
[335:06.77]Thank you, Zarina, for the $1.
[335:08.32]Just wanted to say how much I love you, Jerma.
[335:09.56]Also wanted to do an olive chat to see this picture I found.
[335:14.36]It's like a guy with a mustache and it says, like, E. I don't know what this is.
[335:24.49]Thank you.
[335:27.11]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $1.
[335:28.69]I was happy, so I decided to give you this.
[335:30.37]But really, Jeremy, don't do crack.
[335:32.31]It can help you overcome the addiction.
[335:33.59]Don't you know that crack makes you bald and shortens your legs?
[335:36.98]Here, eat some fries instead.
[335:38.36]And then he does that, like, meme with the lines.
[335:42.90]Thank you, Marvash Magali.
[335:44.60]Good advice.
[335:46.20]Andy, thank you.

[336:18.64]uh well clown in the town is like fairly illegal unless uh we have like a license from the city which I mean you're talking about like it would probably to make clown in the town it would probably cost like a hundred and fifty thousand dollars I don't get that kind of money that's an idea that would be fun but that's like a that's like a one to two hundred thousand dollar project oh well
[336:46.60]What is Clown in the Town?
[336:47.73]Oh, just do like a Google search for Clown in the Town.

[337:44.25]Oops.
[337:46.37]It's still loud.
[338:00.71]What's fucking wrong with me?
[338:06.49]Maybe there's a crack in my water supply.
[338:11.50]I should look into that.
[338:12.76]I'm gonna test my water for like pH crack levels.
[338:17.51]Thank you, dude.
[338:19.49]Appreciate it.
[338:20.03]That was pretty good.
[338:22.99]Crack water.

[339:03.69]Thanks.
[339:04.07]Also, you're fucking fired.
[339:05.91]The boss doesn't like those who hate androids, scalios, manservants, dragon ladies, iguanas, and fried hot dog lovers.
[339:15.82]Oh, this job sucked anyways.
[339:17.28]I'm glad to be gone.
[339:18.98]Thank you, though.
[339:19.54]Tell the boss I said thank you.
[339:22.08]Hey, Gaga Pudding, thanks for the $5.
[339:23.62]Hey, Jeremy, did I ever tell you the story of my old bones?
[339:29.36]Anywho, I love everything that you do, and it's weird as it sounds.
[339:33.10]You have taught me how to laugh again, and I thank you for that.
[339:35.74]I hope the Vegas move goes as smooth as this gameplay.
[339:39.86]Well... Uh...
[339:44.11]That means I'm going to run over a bunch of squirrels and we're going to hit two trees.
[339:47.87]So... Let's hope it goes smoother than that.
[339:54.57]But thank you, Gaga Pudding.
[339:55.77]Appreciate it.
[339:58.05]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[340:00.99]Hey, Zarina.
[340:01.45]Thanks for the $1, Zarina.
[340:02.45]Remember to visit Good Springs when you move to Vegas.
[340:04.53]Actually, both Good Springs and Prim are real towns.
[340:07.81]But Prim is actually smaller in real life than it is in game.
[340:11.11]Anywho, have a happy holidays.
[340:14.73]I plan to check out most of the places around Vegas.
[340:17.85]There's a lot of interesting places.
[340:21.26]And plus, everywhere in New Vegas that I saw in-game, I'm going to go just drive to it and just stand in the middle of it and take a picture.
[340:27.26]Why not?
[340:29.46]And finally, we have silence from the air conditioner, so that's good.
[340:34.19]Thank you, Major Nom, for the $5.
[340:36.15]Hey, Germ Boy, love you lots.
[340:38.92]Been watching you since I was in school.
[340:40.88]Just graduated today, and it's my birthday tomorrow.
[340:43.50]Still watching after all these years.
[340:45.16]Never given bits, though, so have these ones.
[340:48.28]Love you, love you, love you.
[340:50.01]That's a lot of love yous, dude.
[340:53.43]That's like three in a row, man.
[340:57.43]Thank you so much.
[340:58.41]Happy birthday tomorrow, by the way.
[341:00.75]Have a good birthday.
[341:02.56]Happy birthday, dude.
[341:03.61]Have a good one.
[341:04.07]Major Dom.
[341:13.39]Appreciate the $5 birthdays.
[341:18.13]Something with an S. I don't know.
[341:19.97]You got it.
[341:20.57]Thank you, dude.
[341:21.07]I didn't die to Pinwheel one fucking time.
[341:22.67]He was the easiest boss.
[341:39.37]Thank you, eefs, for the $2.45.
[341:40.43]Appreciate that, man.
[341:42.27]Hey, German, just wanted to say I love you, man.
[341:44.37]And I did beat the Nameless King, finally.
[341:47.29]But I did realize afterwards that he was an optional boss.
[341:49.57]I thought he was the last Lord of Cinder, but I was sorely fucking mistaken.
[341:53.85]But I beat the game and I beat the DLC and beat Gale first try.
[341:57.15]That's good.
[341:58.37]He's the best boss fight ever.
[342:01.29]Please be proud of me.
[342:02.12]This is my first Souls game.
[342:03.26]Love you, Jeremy.
[342:03.80]Sorry for the minimal amount of bits today.
[342:07.75]Don't feel sorry for giving me, like, three bucks, dude.
[342:13.74]Like, I'm not some, like, benevolent money monster that you have to feed, otherwise he'll grow in size and, like, stomp on New York.
[342:22.60]You don't have to give me any money at all.
[342:25.60]Thank you, man.
[342:26.14]I appreciate it.
[342:26.80]Thank you.
[342:28.08]Gale is the best boss in the whole series, so... Only feel sorry if it's less than a hundred.
[342:41.79]Get out of here.
[342:43.25]Get out of here.
[342:43.83]Talix, you didn't just beat Dark Souls on stream.
[342:46.07]Get him out of here.
[342:50.02]Hey, stick that on the achievement list.
[342:54.92]Thanks a lot, though, dude.
[342:55.58]I'm glad you enjoyed the game.
[342:56.56]It's a good one.
[342:58.16]Play the other ones now, especially Bloodborne.
[342:59.66]It's the best.
[343:05.42]Thank you, holeofonezombie, for the $1.
[343:06.94]If you do an old FPS stream, you should play the Quake mod Malice, just for the stupid intro.
[343:16.49]Yeah, I'll look into all kinds of mods and first-person old games and stuff.
[343:24.99]I will definitely jot that one down.
[343:27.95]Hey, Boozy Cat, thanks for the $5.05.
[343:30.05]Never played a Souls game, but can watch you play them all day.
[343:33.11]Any idea which game a noob like me should start with?
[343:36.77]Also, good luck with the impending move.
[343:38.96]Hey, love you as always.
[343:39.86]And they say, Moon too cute.
[343:43.38]Thank you, Boozy Cat.
[343:46.12]Um... I would probably start... I would say you should start with Bloodborne or Dark Souls 3.
[343:56.16]Those are the most...
[344:00.82]Those are the most developed out of all of them, I would say.
[344:04.62]Especially Dark Souls 3.
[344:09.47]Dark Souls 1... Well, let's just put it this way.
[344:12.95]I beat Bloodborne.
[344:14.87]I beat Dark Souls 3.
[344:17.26]And Dark Souls 2.
[344:18.18]And Dark Souls 1 turned me away.
[344:21.92]I just didn't get it at first, because it was just the whole... Wait, I can't warp anywhere?
[344:26.72]I can't just go to a checkpoint?
[344:29.14]I have to walk everywhere?
[344:30.54]I mean, if you want to start with Dark Souls 1, just be aware that you're going to get lost by design.
[344:40.79]I would say Bloodborne's probably the one to start with, though.
[344:48.33]I would say if you're going to start with Bloodborne, go Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3...
[344:53.04]Demon souls Dark Souls 2 and then Dark Souls 1 like that's like going completely backwards That's like hey play this series backwards completely Or actually I would do Dark Souls 2 last Demon souls should be last no no no no no no
[345:13.87]Demon's Souls should not be last because if you play Bloodborne and you play Dark Souls 3, Demon's Souls is that kind of gameplay.
[345:21.28]It's a hub world teleporting around.
[345:24.80]I would even do Bloodborne then Demon's Souls because that's like the same game.
[345:28.84]That's the same like type of game that they made.
[345:34.32]Yeah, Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2.
[345:38.48]Got it.
[345:40.72]That's the way you should go.
[345:47.90]Just keep in mind that after you beat Bloodborne and Demon's Souls, that you're essentially playing different video games.
[345:58.06]Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2.
[346:01.60]There you go.
[346:04.46]Let's move on with the bits.
[346:07.09]Ifawa, thank you, Ifawa, for the $5.
[346:10.39]SoftCap is at $60 in this game, you cute idiot boy.
[346:16.92]Is it?
[346:17.40]I thought it was always 40.
[346:20.95]Isn't 40... I thought 60 was a hard cap.
[346:23.23]I don't know.
[346:26.77]I thought that was... I thought it was 40.
[346:30.34]Well, maybe not.
[346:33.32]You've heard the Surge is on... Don't play the Surge.
[346:36.00]Don't play Surge.
[346:36.86]Don't do it.
[346:38.34]Do not play that game.
[346:41.02]Yeah, it's Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2.
[346:46.73]Then burn the Surge.
[346:49.47]That's part of it.
[346:54.45]That's what happens after you beat Dark Souls 1.
[346:56.11]Or Dark Souls 2.
[346:59.75]And then get shitfaced and play Nioh for two hours and then give up on it and never play it again.
[347:05.50]That's what I did.
[347:08.59]Thank you, Kilgannon, for the $1.
[347:09.77]Congrats, Jeremy, on beating the hardest boss in the game.
[347:13.55]Hey, thank you.
[347:15.93]Twitchy Turian, thanks for the $2.50.
[347:17.21]Are you the guy that streamed Wizard101 before God of War?
[347:22.14]Yes.
[347:23.70]That would be a true statement.
[347:24.78]Yes, I am.
[347:26.84]Hey, Quaj, or Kaj, thanks for the $1.50 here.
[347:29.62]Thank you for being such a positive source of entertainment to thousands and thousands of all of us all these years.
[347:35.29]You're my favorite person I've never met.
[347:37.43]And I hope the best for your dreams and ambitions with your content.
[347:41.13]That all being said, you better not miss your court date, buddy.
[347:47.01]We'll see.
[347:50.55]We'll see.
[347:51.57]Thank you, though, man.
[347:54.09]Should go smoothly.
[347:54.75]I used to hope so.
[347:57.71]Tetragetton, thanks for the $1.
[347:59.35]First try.
[348:01.05]That's how we usually do it.
[348:04.94]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[348:06.36]The commentators for the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest were making crypto jokes.
[348:11.01]I mean, it's topical.
[348:17.45]I mean, it's a topical thing.
[348:20.95]Hey, Broluck, thanks for the $1.
[348:21.92]Hey, Jeremy, are you still going to play Destroy All Humans 2?
[348:26.34]Yes.
[348:27.74]That is actually the next thing we're going to do.
[348:30.78]Destroy All Humans 2 will be after Sunday, which is a Dark Souls multiplayer PvP fun time.
[348:38.23]So the next game is going to be Destroy All Humans 2.
[348:42.89]Thank you, dude.
[348:43.26]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[348:44.34]Maybe your back hurts because you were lifting an old CRT TV.
[348:48.08]No, that was ages ago at this point.
[348:51.38]Dreamcast still happening?
[348:52.30]Yes, it's still back here.
[348:53.67]Still ready to go.
[348:56.51]Chelsea is waifu, thanks for the $1.
[348:59.15]You know who's having back problems?
[349:00.41]Solaire, because you won't call him.
[349:02.41]Bible thump.
[349:04.55]He's dead anyways, doesn't matter.
[349:07.53]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer, how you doing?

[349:18.10]Hey everyone, sorry I can't be there in person.
[349:20.84]I've been crashing at the Grandma Arbuckle house for the holiday.
[349:24.09]I've been away from home, so I couldn't make a Garfield comic.
[349:28.07]Sorry all, but I brought a question for Jay Larius.
[349:32.13]If you had a bodyguard to protect you from the zombie apocalypse, who would you have?
[349:36.08]This character or person can't be immortal and have god powers.
[349:39.26]And then he winks at me.
[349:41.94]Um... Satan.
[349:45.52]Wait, no, no, hold on.
[349:46.76]He can't be... Is it Satan?
[349:47.88]Yeah, Satan's immortal.
[349:48.64]Never mind.
[349:48.96]He's a god, too.
[349:50.69]Oh, whoops.
[349:54.58]um I don't know fucking like I have no idea it would be somebody strong it can't be a god it has to be like a person I don't know jason statham not the actor jason statham like the jason statham that's in the movies seems correct
[350:20.24]Thank you bro luck for the $1.

[350:26.57]I'm sorry Mangled squid again.
[350:31.73]Thanks for the hundred dollars earlier.

[350:49.56]They twist and crack you good.
[350:51.74]I'm not even sure that's what it is, though.
[350:56.16]Hey, thank you, Captain Worgen, for the $1.
[350:58.03]Here's a dollar for your back stomping extreme stretching fetish.
[351:00.85]Go wild, kid.
[351:02.01]That's a dollar.
[351:07.75]Go wild.
[351:09.21]Go wild with $1. $1.
[351:12.15]Hey, can you, uh, can you, like, stomp on my back and, like, step all over me?
[351:17.67]Yeah.
[351:18.57]How much does that cost?
[351:19.89]Does it cost a dollar?
[351:22.46]Door slam in my face.
[351:27.48]Hey, wees, vees, vees, vees, vas.
[351:32.56]Thank you, vas, vees.

[351:51.42]Vice.
[351:51.82]There, it's Vice.
[351:52.96]I said every single thing except for the one that was correct.
[351:56.48]Thank you, Vice.
[351:57.48]Hey, Jeremy, I was wondering if you had a solid move date.
[352:00.20]Are you planning to do a Vegas house stream?
[352:02.35]Are there any conventions you think you might go to out there?
[352:05.51]I think for the $100 donation sound, you should have the I win, I get $100 bucks clip.
[352:11.90]um actually it's a good idea to have different ones for I don't really need to do that don't I uh but to answer your question uh there is a solid move date it is happening uh very soon I have well it's it's weird because I have a solid date
[352:34.96]But it's going to be really strange.
[352:37.20]And I could go into details as to why.
[352:39.65]But let's just say there's a lot of paperwork that has to be done on my end.
[352:45.21]And there's a lot of stuff I have to do.
[352:47.73]Because moving across the country is one thing.
[352:52.45]But am I moving into a casino?
[352:55.52]No.
[352:58.87]Uh, for... I... It's just gonna be really, really... It's gonna be a huge pain in the ass.
[353:03.32]So, it's like a soft date of somewhere in the end of August.
[353:08.60]That's like the soft... Like, the papers are gonna get signed.
[353:13.62]He's joining Scientology.
[353:15.90]There's no Scientology camp out in Las Vegas.
[353:22.77]We'll see, though.
[353:25.03]Uh, any conventions?
[353:25.91]I'm not going to any conventions for the rest of the year.
[353:28.88]I don't even know if I'm going to TwitchCon because I'm about to lose a lot of money.
[353:33.95]I'm about to blow a huge amount of money moving across the country.
[353:36.61]So I'm not going to really... I don't think I'll have enough to... Hey, let me like go dick around in like San Jose or wherever it is.
[353:44.16]I'm focusing all of my financial attention on moving to Las Vegas.
[353:48.24]So I probably will not be going to any conventions this year.
[353:54.16]But thank you.
[353:54.92]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[353:56.12]That Mario song is copywritten.
[353:57.58]Have fun in prison.
[353:59.66]Whatever, come get me.
[354:01.66]I'm here.
[354:03.14]I'll pay the fee.
[354:04.87]What is it, like $1.50?
[354:06.41]Thanks for paying the fee, Broluck.
[354:08.47]Thank you, Brightcore, for the $1.
[354:09.89]Thank you, TheCapDavid, for the $1.
[354:13.17]Yes, I see the evil in your eyes, but you know my Undertaker is going to destroy him at SummerSlam.
[354:18.01]Oh my goodness, did you hear that?
[354:21.40]The original subsound.
[354:24.61]There it is.
[354:29.73]Oh my goodness.
[354:31.69]One day maybe I'll just play that again.
[354:33.08]Just bring it back.
[354:34.76]Thank you Brightcore for the $1.
[354:36.36]Thank you Broluck for the $1.
[354:37.78]I'm going to bed.
[354:38.32]Enjoy your slide on repeat forever.
[354:43.19]That was so much fun.
[354:44.61]What a dumb boss, but that was fun.
[354:47.66]Hey, HoneyChain, thanks for the $1.
[354:49.02]My brother sometimes did the same thing except without hockey pads during my Pluto.
[354:54.80]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[354:57.20]That's... Oh, God.
[355:01.02]Thank you, Erdemius, for the $1.
[355:03.16]Streamer's still in Anor Londo.
[355:05.38]Alexa, this is so sad.
[355:06.78]Play Tachyon.
[355:10.52]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[355:11.74]Still in Orlando, I see.
[355:14.12]Sad faces.
[355:15.52]Sir Feline, thanks again for the $1.
[355:16.88]GG, I was the game dev.
[355:19.42]Prove it in writing.
[355:21.82]And I'll believe you.
[355:24.00]But thank you, though.
[355:25.80]Thank you, Son of Jenova, for the $1.
[355:26.94]Chairman, we need to know when you're releasing Dark Souls 4.
[355:30.44]We can't wait anymore.
[355:31.40]Please don't make it turn into a meme like Half-Life 3.
[355:34.48]Thank you, your fans.
[355:35.30]Thanks, man.
[355:38.30]I don't think Dark Souls 4 will ever release.
[355:43.44]And if it ever releases, it would probably be a different studio.
[355:46.40]I don't think they'll ever do it again.
[355:48.36]They might make another game like this.
[355:53.47]It depends on what Sekiro is.
[355:56.99]I don't think we'll ever see another Dark Souls game.
[356:00.75]We'll see.
[356:04.11]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[356:05.53]I love Seath's Pee-wee Herman theme.
[356:10.48]Did he have a Pee-wee Herman theme?
[356:13.30]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[356:14.66]Fun fact.
[356:17.36]The squid wig slugs were Guinevere's handmaids before Seath turned them into the new form.
[356:25.88]Feels weird, man.
[356:28.20]Why is Seath so weird?
[356:31.90]Hey, Zamanrio.
[356:36.74]Thank you, though.
[356:38.02]Hey, thank you, Flank Tank, for the $5.
[356:41.79]Hey Jerma, now that you're done with Dark Souls 1 and with the announcement of Nioh 2, any chance you'll go back and play Nioh 1?
[356:48.17]The PC Complete Edition is on sale.
[356:50.37]The game is quite fun so long as you're not shit-faced.
[356:52.78]Thanks.
[356:55.72]I mean, if I get the Dark Souls-ish bug again, then Nioh is the only one that I could play that I haven't played yet.
[357:05.24]Maybe.
[357:08.34]Maybe.
[357:09.28]I'm not going to say yes, but sometimes I need to play a Souls-like game.
[357:17.24]And don't even say the Surge.
[357:19.76]I'm going to ban that word in my chat.
[357:21.76]That's going to be a banned word in my chat.
[357:26.38]If you ever want to talk to me about your favorite soda from the 90s, I'm sorry, you're not going to be able to say it.
[357:34.64]Uh, thanks though, man.
[357:35.74]Thank you for the $5 flank tank.
[357:37.02]And again for $10.
[357:38.02]Thanks for the $15 total here, man.
[357:40.88]Have I looked up anything about Nier Automata?
[357:44.64]Winky face.
[357:46.28]I have.
[357:49.00]I think I would check out Nier at some point after I move.
[357:55.99]Because I kind of have an idea of what I'm going to be streaming for the next three to five weeks.
[358:02.19]And I don't think it's going to be on that.
[358:05.55]So, that might be fun to do.
[358:07.61]After the move.
[358:10.57]But thanks for the $15, Blank Tank.
[358:11.97]Appreciate it, man.
[358:14.45]Thank you, Hawkeye of Mine, for the $1.50.
[358:16.19]What in tarnation.
[358:20.00]What in tarnation.
[358:22.42]It's too hard for this non-gamer.
[358:24.50]You just watched me beat Dark Souls on stream.
[358:26.72]You just watched me beat one of the harder games that is available.
[358:30.34]You just watched me do it.
[358:33.14]You just saw me do it.
[358:35.17]I just finished it.
[358:37.87]You think Nier Automata is too hard for me when I just beat Dark Souls on stream?
[358:45.03]Dark Souls is not easy.
[358:59.46]He used a shield.
[359:00.44]I didn't use a shield.
[359:02.94]I barely, I was dodging.
[359:06.44]What about the surge?
[359:08.14]That's banned word.
[359:09.08]You just said it.
[359:12.12]Kindled to 20.
[359:13.38]I did that one time because everyone told me to do it as a joke.
[359:20.67]But regardless, thank you.
[359:22.35]Thank you Captain Soviet for the $1.
[359:24.71]Thank you Acknowledge John for the $1.
[359:26.25]Hey guys, Zach here.
[359:27.13]Good stream.
[359:28.63]Sad you didn't play me and Mr. Rides' song.
[359:35.05]Sorry, we were taking song requests for a minute there, but thanks, man.
[359:39.38]Thank you, Kyra Toby, for the $1.
[359:40.90]Repost because Jerma doesn't read sub-messages.
[359:45.08]That is true, I don't.
[359:47.35]I do not read sub-messages.
[359:48.75]You are correct.
[359:51.02]But I do like to be brought attention of things when they happen.
[359:56.70]So this is from Luden Crude.
[359:59.28]You've been a source of laughter for me and my fiance during some hard times these last few weeks.
[360:03.55]We both love what you're doing and watch as many streams live as we can.
[360:06.95]We lost my brother to brain cancer and was still in shock.
[360:10.73]Fuck cancer.
[360:13.42]Yeah, fuck cancer, man.
[360:14.62]Seriously.
[360:17.04]So sorry to hear that.
[360:20.85]Cancer is just a... awful fucking thing.
[360:28.10]And I really do hope, like, honestly, somewhere in the future,
[360:34.02]I'm talking, like, whenever it can get figured out with whatever technology needs to happen in medical research and advancements.
[360:40.56]But, man, is it gonna be great for people to be able to be, like, it's done.
[360:46.46]It's just curable.
[360:48.60]I fucking hope that happens.
[360:50.50]I hope people can just seriously, like, 10, 20, 30, 40 years in the future just be like, wow, it's fucking over.
[360:57.80]It's done.
[360:58.40]We did it.
[361:01.48]So, I'm really sorry to hear that, LudenKruid.
[361:13.70]But I wish you, uh, I wish you the best, obviously, in this time of, um, time of, uh, of terrible, terrible shit that you have to go through.
[361:27.95]But thank you for putting, bringing that to my attention, KaraToby.
[361:30.13]Appreciate it.
[361:34.87]And now moving on to Crowden.
[361:36.13]Thank you, Crowden, for the 10 bucks.
[361:39.38]Finally got to catch a stream.
[361:41.23]Just wanted to say you've gotten me through some junk in my life since 2012.
[361:45.45]Your casual commentaries have always stuck with me.
[361:48.15]I keep hoping you would bring that kind of series back, but that's just wishful thinking.
[361:52.48]Keep up the good work.
[361:53.32]Also, is Kim going with you to Vegas?
[361:54.74]Just wondering.
[361:55.48]Yes.
[361:57.42]Yes, she is.
[362:03.12]Yes, she is.
[362:04.36]And I feel like it's evolved over the last few years because anything I've ever wanted to talk about or anything I've wanted to say, I don't need to open up Audacity and sit there and talk for six minutes.
[362:21.73]We can just do it here, right?
[362:23.99]How many times have we stopped midstream and just like discussed something or gone off the rails and talked about something?
[362:29.05]You know what I mean?
[362:29.57]I feel like it's here.
[362:33.74]So, you know, they're not literally like a six minute titled or eight minute titled commentary on something.
[362:40.84]We just kind of talk about stuff whenever it is.
[362:48.18]But thank you so much, Croton.
[362:50.26]Appreciate it.
[362:53.06]We also got Rat Puke Face.
[362:54.76]That's a great name, by the way.
[362:56.51]Thanks for the $1.
[362:57.33]Jeremy, you have to watch JoJo.
[362:58.77]There's literally a character named Robert Edward O. Speedwagon.
[363:04.40]That's the first anime I'm watching in 2019 for my one anime a year is gonna be JoJo.
[363:10.70]We'll see.
[363:13.18]Thank you SirFeline for the one dollar.
[363:16.07]Gwendolyn is the top part of Aldrich in Dark Souls 3 because Aldrich is eating him.
[363:21.69]Feels bad.
[363:23.41]Jesus.
[363:27.65]That's fucked up.
[363:32.21]I did not know that that's interesting lore.
[363:37.10]uh let's see moving on here thank you kyra toby for the one dollar uh I think here we go kyra toby thanks for the one dollar repost because streamer doesn't read bits under a hundred dollars a hundred hundred bits a dollar repost because streamer doesn't read bits under a hundred this is from alexander gabriel he says franker z
[364:06.19]Jerma, the reason it's a guy is because Gwyn was prophesized that he was supposed to have one son and two daughters.
[364:14.74]Then he goes ahead and has two sons, one daughter, Gwyndolin, the banished son, and Gwynevere.
[364:20.84]So he raises his son Gwyndolin as a woman.
[364:23.39]I think that's how it goes.
[364:24.35]I hope you'll read this.
[364:28.65]Well, here it is, I guess.
[364:31.81]Gwendolyn, Gwenevere, Gwanavere, Gwondolin.
[364:35.03]How many fucking Gwanavies do you have?
[364:36.63]Like, seriously.
[364:38.20]Are you that much of a fucking narcissistic psychopath?
[364:41.08]Psychopath?
[364:42.74]What's my name?
[364:43.86]Oh, well, your name is Gwyn.
[364:44.96]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[364:45.56]My son will be Gwendolyn.
[364:46.90]My daughter will be Gwenevere.
[364:48.56]Just make sure that has Gwyn in the name.
[364:51.46]Gwendo, Gwando.
[364:54.02]Don't you think that's a little narcissistic?
[364:55.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[364:56.61]Opening my hand and closing it.
[364:58.53]And then point to the door.
[365:08.07]But thanks, man.
[365:09.71]Thank you, Banana Aneurysm, for the 10 bucks here.
[365:14.03]Dark Sun Gwyndolin is a... is a trans woman and FromSoftware was a bit not good at doing that in Dark Souls without being stupid.
[365:28.47]I don't know.
[365:34.61]You mean like the whole son-daughter thing?
[365:41.73]It sounds like they were doing something.
[365:44.45]But, I don't know.
[365:46.17]Is that Muzelk is here?
[365:47.21]And he's a mod too?
[365:50.55]Must have done that in like 2013.
[365:55.53]Must have done that like a year ago.
[365:57.27]Hey!
[365:57.37]No, what's going on man?
[365:57.94]How are you?
[366:00.90]Right.
[366:06.48]No, Muzelk's good.
[366:08.18]Everybody loves Muzelk.
[366:09.08]How could you not?
[366:12.53]Hope you're doing well, man.
[366:17.39]We hung out like a year ago, not even.
[366:20.13]Like last year.
[366:23.77]Hope you're doing well, man, for real.
[366:24.87]Yeah, E3 last year.
[366:29.79]Hope everything is just tidy, man, for real.
[366:35.97]Hey, you going to SwitchCon?
[366:37.19]Guys, I won't be because I'm moving to Las Vegas.
[366:38.95]Fuck!
[366:45.15]We'll have to hang out sometime.
[366:47.83]It's always fun to be around Muselk.
[366:49.47]He's a good dude.
[366:55.43]But where are we here?
[366:57.49]Hey, Asha!
[366:58.19]Thank you, Asha108, for the $5.
[366:59.31]Hey, Jerm, a long time no see.
[367:02.19]Have fun dying to Gwyn over and over again.
[367:04.17]Kappa.
[367:04.73]Well... That comment didn't age well.
[367:10.36]You know what I'm saying?
[367:14.33]Downvoted!
[367:15.37]Downvoted!
[367:16.03]Hey, thank you, Tar Alacrin, for the three bucks.
[367:21.44]Can't wait to watch you play Sekiro, since from his removing leveling, you won't be able to overlevel min-max your character in offline mode to complete the game on easy mode.
[367:30.34]Game license revoked.
[367:32.03]Pending speedrun stream of Bloodborne.
[367:39.53]Come on.
[367:42.46]You're not- I don't get like at least one or two points for putting on- not being able to see Gwyn and cartoon hammering him first try.
[367:51.38]I don't get anything for that.
[367:52.66]Not even like 10 gamer cents.
[367:59.79]I don't get fucking gamer points for putting the windshield wipers in front of my screen while I'm playing against him with the big head and the hammer and doing the cartoon hammer finish.
[368:09.69]I don't get anything for that.
[368:17.19]Surge alert.
[368:23.11]Surge alert.
[368:27.60]One day I'll just play the surge on stream.
[368:32.30]No, I won't.
[368:32.74]That's a fucking lie.
[368:33.64]That'll never happen.
[368:37.18]Thank you, Hawkeye of Mine, for the $1.50.
[368:38.46]He says, LUL, that fucking getup, man.
[368:40.64]How are you gonna do this?
[368:43.76]I did it.
[368:44.78]I did it.
[368:46.42]I did it.
[368:49.24]Thank you, though.
[368:51.03]Tetris Onion, thanks for the $5.
[368:52.85]PogChamp, cheers to the cartoon ending.
[368:57.99]Thank you.
[368:58.59]I want to get the... When he first dove in, we just jumped at each other at the same time.
[369:05.05]That was fun.
[369:06.19]I liked that.
[369:08.13]Thank you, TarAlegrin, again, for the $2.
[369:09.39]This guy beat Dark Souls 1 on stream by kindling to plus 20 Estus on every boss in offline mode.
[369:17.05]But that didn't even happen.
[369:18.95]You are, like, you're building up this fantasy.
[369:21.67]You're building up a, you're building a gigantic Germa straw man fantasy world.
[369:27.18]Where, like, I was level 150.
[369:29.58]I had, like, 100 poids.
[369:31.72]I had 20 estus.
[369:34.16]That's a giant Germa straw man.
[369:35.72]Tear that shit down.
[369:45.03]I live in reality.
[369:47.20]And the reality is... Ornstein and Smog.
[369:54.14]Six tries.
[369:56.08]I heard you told me you were on Ornstein and Smog for like six hours.
[370:00.01]So now you're going to build up the straw germa and burn them.
[370:09.95]Seventy Estes?
[370:15.95]There's a whole country named after me in the anime One Piece.
[370:23.95]What?
[370:25.99]No, I'm just kidding, man.
[370:26.97]And I know you are too, so thanks a lot.
[370:32.48]Overhyped boss.
[370:38.68]I didn't have 99 Estus.
[370:44.64]I wasn't over-leveled either.
[370:45.86]I was right in the sweet spot for where people should be on their first playthrough blind in the game.
[370:51.49]Go look it up on www.reddit.com.
[370:54.07]Type in, what level should I be at when I get to Gwyn?
[370:58.29]And guess what?
[370:59.29]Everybody says 100, 95, 80, 90, 80, 90, 90, 100.
[370:59.97]I'm in the fucking sweet spot.
[371:12.68]One loser said that?
[371:13.90]No, like 600 people.
[371:18.64]Reddit.com says, what level should I be to die to pinwheel?
[371:21.22]All right, never mind.
[371:23.17]You guys are going to get me.
[371:24.89]You guys are going to keep getting me, aren't you?
[371:32.53]What level should I be to die to pinwheel?
[371:39.09]Oh, yeah, yeah, alright, well, whatever.
[371:41.79]Thank you, uh, Tar Alacrin, appreciate it, man.
[371:43.95]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the one dollar here.
[371:46.69]Jeremy used to be thrilled because he was skilled, now he's disheveled because he's overleveled.
[371:53.07]No, you know what?
[371:54.09]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna bite this in the ass right now.
[371:58.57]What level should I be for Gwyn?
[372:03.02]What soul level did you beat Dark Souls on your first run is the first thing here.
[372:07.40]Let's take a look.
[372:09.15]The number one most upvoted thing on this post is SL97 is about right.
[372:14.39]I was somewhere around there.
[372:15.49]Hmm.
[372:19.49]What about this person?
[372:20.83]I'm pretty sure after I beat Gwyn and leveled up with the souls I got, I was exactly so level 99.
[372:25.71]Between like 85 to 100 seems to be around where most people's first playthroughs will finish.
[372:30.71]Huh.
[372:31.91]Around 115.
[372:33.05]Got caught up a lot in PvP.
[372:36.52]SL99 first run.
[372:39.39]89 or 90 or so.
[372:40.15]101 here.
[372:40.85]You're not going to build up a fucking straw man.
[372:47.49]You're not going to bring me to Burning Man and like burn me with a bunch of like hippies screaming shit.
[372:52.33]I'm not going to do that.
[372:53.05]I'm not going to Burning Man.
[372:54.07]I don't want to go to Burning Man.
[372:55.07]Don't bring me there.
[372:57.19]Although I'm sure it's a nice time.
[373:05.72]I'm not going.
[373:06.34]Don't bring me.
[373:19.30]Go fund me to bring Jerma to Burning Man.
[373:24.74]What even is Burning Man?
[373:25.88]I've heard about it before.
[373:26.62]Do they actually just make a giant guy and burn him?
[373:32.41]What do they do?
[373:35.69]They just build a giant wooden guy and they light him on fire.
[373:38.39]Doesn't that hurt?
[373:41.29]Isn't that dangerous?
[373:44.79]Can't you like get burnt if it's like a giant fire in the woods?
[373:53.59]They don't stand in the fire.
[373:54.81]Well, you're going to be standing near the fire if the thing's fucking 200 feet tall.
[374:00.67]It's in Nevada.
[374:02.59]It's not in Nevada.
[374:04.47]There's no Burning Man in Nevada.
[374:05.97]Don't make me look this up.
[374:06.93]Burning Man.
[374:08.76]2018.
[374:10.38]You know they do it every year.
[374:13.88]Okay, it's coming up, actually.
[374:16.58]Sunday, August 26th.
[374:17.36]Where is it?
[374:24.31]Oh god, it is!
[374:25.63]It's in Nevada!
[374:27.99]Oh no!
[374:32.10]Burning Man is in Nevada!
[374:37.62]Am I going to Burning Man this year?
[374:46.25]That's... I did not know that.
[374:47.75]Okay.
[374:49.81]I might do a stream at Burning Man, except I don't think I could.
[374:53.37]Don't people walk around naked at Burning Man?
[374:55.07]I can't stream Burning Man.
[374:56.43]People like walk around with their penises out.
[374:59.08]Don't they?
[374:59.48]Hold on a second.
[375:03.26]Do people walk around nude at Burning Man?
[375:10.52]Okay, here we go.
[375:11.36]Is everyone really naked?
[375:12.68]Here's 10 common misconceptions about Burning Man.
[375:17.82]So, why do you have to even answer this question?
[375:25.77]You barter for things.
[375:30.39]Wait, hold on.
[375:30.89]Do you like trade and shit here?
[375:34.35]Here's okay.
[375:34.85]Everyone is naked.
[375:35.65]Well, some people are.
[375:37.22]Daytime temperatures are squeltering, so most people aren't wearing much more than they would at the beach.
[375:41.62]And costumes are a huge part of the culture, which means some people are in tuxedos.
[375:46.20]Wait, what?
[375:49.14]Hold on.
[375:49.38]People wear tuxedos to Burning Man?
[375:51.16]Okay.
[375:54.57]Okay.
[375:57.02]All those are just in full body paint to be honest the nudity isn't all that noteworthy compared to some of the crazy elaborate outfits Okay All right, we're going to Burning Man this year Is it would it count me going to Burning Man if I stayed really far away and just like zoomed in to the guy burning I
[376:26.47]and just hung out like with a picnic blanket like four miles away from the event.
[376:33.55]We can look at it in the distance.
[376:41.93]Won't go to TwitchCon, but we'll go to Burning Man.
[376:43.87]But that doesn't cost any money!
[376:45.77]Can't I just like walk up there naked?
[376:47.11]I thought that's how it is.
[376:50.43]You just like walk over to the big guy in the middle and you just take you just naked and you're just like, hey, what's up?
[376:54.95]And like, does it cost any money?
[377:01.27]Oh, it caught... You have to barter.
[377:12.40]I gotta go up there.
[377:12.90]I gotta barter for clothes first.
[377:14.34]That's what I'm saying.
[377:17.20]You go... Burning Man.
[377:22.97]Alright, let's keep going.
[377:27.23]We're not gonna get stuck on Burning Man here.
[377:31.26]Here we go.
[377:31.66]Thank you Kairatobi for the one dollar.
[377:33.00]Come on Gwyn.
[377:33.76]Congrats to you for beating Dark Souls on stream with only a hundred and seventy deaths.
[377:36.64]Remember when you just started out?
[377:39.50]I guess you still got it.
[377:40.95]And there's a clip here of me still gotten it.
[377:43.47]I got this way in.
[378:04.07]Oh, what a mess.
[378:08.31]Jesus.
[378:09.72]That's the thing.
[378:10.10]You get better and you learn and you start playing at a higher skill level.
[378:14.98]But thank you, dude.
[378:15.54]Thank you, KaraToby.
[378:16.22]Thank you, Tara Alecren for the $1.
[378:17.74]Great stream.
[378:18.26]I'm sad that you actually are finished with the Souls games now.
[378:21.74]It's an end of an era.
[378:24.42]Well, that's not true because we're going to play it again on Sunday.
[378:27.60]We're going to do PvP multiplayer.
[378:29.57]It might make a new character and just be as psycho.
[378:31.87]Maybe I'll do, like, lightning or something.
[378:33.19]I don't know.
[378:34.98]We'll have some fun on Sunday.
[378:37.02]In multiplayer madness.
[378:40.94]CaptainCabbage came in with $50.
[378:42.48]I want to make sure I talk about this because I missed it before.
[378:46.38]Thank you, CaptainCabbage, for your $50.
[378:48.58]No message, but much appreciated, man.
[378:51.19]Thank you so much.
[378:57.87]The end of Dark Souls is basically just Burning Man.
[379:00.75]I guess it is.
[379:03.87]Thank you so much, Captain Cabbage, if you're still here.
[379:06.93]Lorag, thanks for the $4, Lorag.
[379:08.61]I was at work, so I missed the final fight, but congrats on beating Darksiders.
[379:12.83]Re-plastered.
[379:15.57]Thanks, dude.
[379:16.51]It was a lot of fun.
[379:18.25]There was a middle point where I... Okay, well, hold on.
[379:20.28]I forgot to tell you about my favorite areas.
[379:21.64]I forgot to talk about any of this shit.
[379:24.32]Okay, favorite area in Dark Souls 1.
[379:28.32]Sen's Fortress.
[379:30.48]That was just, I loved like the game show aggro crag kind of gauntlet.
[379:36.80]That place was awesome.
[379:39.16]Sense Fortress number one.
[379:40.26]Number two would probably be... I don't know, it's close between... I really just like Undead Parish, Undead Burg.
[379:54.75]I like that Undead Burg area.
[380:01.62]Every one of the Dark Souls games kind of has that first little undead parish area.
[380:08.73]And I always think it's one of my favorite places because you're just starting.
[380:13.31]You're excited to play.
[380:16.37]The painting was also a really great place.
[380:18.78]So yeah, but Sans Fortress by a mile I think was my favorite place.
[380:30.21]I would say Anor Londo, but Anor Londo is in every single game.
[380:34.39]You know, that's one location that is pretty much the same in every game.
[380:38.38]So I could say Anor Londo, but it's in every game.
[380:44.88]Least favorite.
[380:46.74]That's very easy.
[380:49.37]The dumbest place in this whole game was either the Tomb of Giants.
[380:56.05]Tomb of Giants was just stupid.
[380:58.85]And New Londo sucks too.
[381:04.85]Tomb of Giants, New Londo, and then that one area where the guy made a Warcraft 3 map.
[381:10.30]Lost Izalith.
[381:10.90]Yeah, that place was just dumb.
[381:15.36]Blighttown's not... I don't hate Blighttown.
[381:19.42]Blighttown is not on that list.
[381:29.62]Blighttown's, like, interesting, as much as it's painful and hard to go through.
[381:33.83]It's an interesting area.
[381:39.23]But anyways, let's keep going.
[381:42.11]Uh...
[381:43.69]Here we are.
[381:44.27]Cardboard.
[381:44.73]Thank you, Cardboard.
[381:45.53]96 for the $1.
[381:46.83]Seems good.
[381:47.29]Thanks, man.
[381:48.69]Captain Cabbage, again, with $65, bringing his total to over $111.
[381:55.34]Thank you for all this money, dude.
[381:58.84]Over $100 here.
[382:00.44]Captain Cabbage, thank you.
[382:01.78]And the no message, just cheer $11,500.
[382:04.78]Thank you so much, Captain Cabbage.
[382:16.65]It's a lot of money, man.
[382:17.47]Thank you.
[382:21.49]Thank you, Tar Alacrin.
[382:23.17]Tar Alacrin again for the $1.
[382:25.53]What level will the PvP be at?
[382:27.21]Can it be an earlier level so I don't have to literally beat the whole game?
[382:30.30]No, it'll be like Soul level 20 or something.
[382:34.56]I'll do the PvP just because it's easier to make a new character and just dick around.
[382:39.66]I don't want to... Remember, I don't know how many people even own the game or have even started playing, so...
[382:46.29]We'll probably do like soul level 30, 20, 30.
[382:50.45]We'll find a good in between there.
[382:52.30]Because you can get to soul level 30, 20 in like less than 25 minutes.
[382:57.88]Beat the first couple bosses and just level up.
[383:03.68]But thanks, man.
[383:07.43]Prime Vino.
[383:08.29]Thanks for the $5, Prime Vino.
[383:09.91]Great stream is usable.
[383:10.75]Your streams are one of the few things that make me feel alive other than my burning my money on Amazon.
[383:17.55]Keep up the good work.
[383:20.24]Thank you, Prime.
[383:22.04]Hopefully you get some nice stuff on Amazon.
[383:23.34]It's a great place.
[383:27.92]But really appreciate it.
[383:28.84]Thanks for the $5, Prime Vino.
[383:32.14]Hope you're doing well.
[383:32.74]112, the worst place ever.
[383:37.59]What's this?
[383:37.95]Oh, this is in the Dark Tomb of Giants.
[383:41.37]Oh, that's a killer!
[383:51.94]What, then a dog comes out or something?
[383:57.38]That's a... Oh, my goodness!
[383:58.48]Oh, my goodness!
[383:59.18]Oh, my goodness!
[384:05.40]Oh, my goodness!
[384:06.15]Oh, my goodness!
[384:09.64]Yeah, and I was right.
[384:12.35]That's the worst place in the game.
[384:15.93]Thank you, me, from 60 deaths ago.
[384:18.69]Oh, there's another clip here.
[384:24.36]Power Star.
[384:25.02]What's this one?
[384:28.39]Oh, yeah.
[384:29.33]We heard this last time.
[384:43.10]Oh my god, Jeremy!
[384:44.50]Why?
[384:44.66]I'm sorry.
[384:51.66]Is it weird, like, watching my own clips?
[384:58.84]Like, oh my god, that was so funny what he did.
[385:00.62]Who is that?
[385:01.08]That's me.
[385:02.00]Oh, I said that.
[385:02.86]Oh, me.
[385:03.46]Oh, that was funny.
[385:04.08]Me.
[385:04.32]No, you're funny, aren't you?
[385:11.10]No, that's a good clip.
[385:11.94]That's funny.
[385:16.88]If you didn't like it, you could... No, no, I'm just fucking around.
[385:21.90]That was a great moment.
[385:28.75]Too funny for your own good.
[385:38.75]No, that's...
[385:41.50]That's a good moment.
[385:44.50]It's weird because we can't hear them.
[385:46.42]Oh, it's because it's turned down.
[385:47.44]Whoops.
[385:52.67]What is this?
[385:53.21]Is this what I just did?
[385:54.13]Oh my god, Jeremy!
[386:00.43]Oh, you can't even hear it.
[386:03.36]You can't even fucking hear it.
[386:06.12]So you just hear some faint sounds in the background.
[386:09.34]What a fucking idiot.
[386:13.13]That would have been, like, funnier if you actually could hear it.
[386:15.93]What a dumbass.
[386:16.61]Whatever.
[386:16.89]Uh, but thank you.
[386:20.89]Thank you, lgiantrat for the $1.50.
[386:22.49]Appreciate what I caught of the stream.
[386:25.50]Thought I would contribute.
[386:26.38]Thank you, man.
[386:30.30]Have a great night, giantrat.
[386:31.30]Thanks a lot.
[386:34.80]Uh, sirfeline again.
[386:35.60]Thanks for the dollar.
[386:36.24]Hearing you lose your enthusiasm to read bits after getting rickrolled was great.
[386:44.82]It sounds like I'm just like dying in this room.
[386:47.92]I wonder what the internal temperature of this room is right now.
[386:52.57]It's probably like 125 degrees in here.
[386:54.79]And it's so humid.
[386:57.37]I'm like, I'm literally just like cooking in this fucking room.
[387:04.83]But thank you, Surfing Line.
[387:07.11]Did I just finish Dark Souls?
[387:08.31]Yes, I did.
[387:08.77]It was a lot of fun.
[387:09.47]Great game.
[387:13.87]I would recommend.
[387:16.07]Hey, Jokergoat, thanks for the $1, dude.
[387:17.83]Hey, German, it's okay if you don't know everything in Dark Souls.
[387:19.53]We learn things every day.
[387:20.53]A couple weeks ago, I learned that running was invented in 1748 by a guy named Thomas Running when he tried to walk twice at the same time.
[387:29.23]Pretty cool, huh?
[387:30.75]Anyways, love you and chat so much.
[387:50.91]all right I I love this I love this comment so much but honest to god like this is my favorite that's my favorite like bit message of the year but also at the same time this was the dumbest thing I've ever read out loud I think I think that might be the dumbest thing I've ever read
[388:25.84]I mean, it's high quality dumb.
[388:27.78]You know what I mean?
[388:28.34]It's high... It was effort.
[388:31.32]But that's a Twitter joke?
[388:33.64]That's not even... That's not original content?
[388:36.36]That's not original content?
[388:38.99]Oh, no.
[388:40.25]Joker Goat.
[388:41.13]Come on, man.
[388:46.79]No.
[388:48.87]Oh.
[388:49.99]Well, it doesn't matter.
[388:50.61]It's still funny.
[388:56.86]Hey, StixRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[388:58.16]I was joking.
[388:58.64]You rehired.
[388:59.20]Double the pay.
[388:59.68]Thanks, man.
[389:01.94]Get my old waiter job back.
[389:05.49]Thank you, PrimeVino, for the $2.
[389:06.85]I forgot which stream it was, but people were sharing their dogs, so here's mine mid-sneeze.
[389:15.74]Oh, what a cute dog.
[389:17.76]Is this... What kind of dog is this?
[389:28.62]He's so cute.
[389:30.62]What a cute dog.
[389:31.28]Is that a Jack Russell?
[389:39.95]Is that a Thomas Running?
[389:43.53]Thanks a lot, Prime.
[389:44.13]You know, and your wonderful, cute, handsome boy.
[389:46.57]Hey, Sir Phelan, thanks for the $1.
[389:50.33]Searchlight is real too, Jerma.
[389:51.97]I want to see pictures of you there as proof.
[389:56.88]What?
[389:59.74]What are you talking about?
[390:02.06]Like Fox Searchlight?
[390:03.34]The movie company?
[390:07.80]What are we talking about here?
[390:12.62]Oh, so Searchlight is like a town.
[390:14.62]Okay.
[390:16.68]From New Vegas.
[390:17.42]Okay, I get you.
[390:20.93]Yeah, maybe.
[390:24.59]Who's the hardest Soulsborne boss?
[390:26.47]Mr. Joker Bomb wants to know.
[390:30.43]I mean, I would say Orphan.
[390:32.85]Orphan of Kos is probably the hardest boss.
[390:36.37]Although, some of those last bosses in Dark Souls 3... Who's the Dark Souls 3 boss that has three phases?
[390:48.55]And I just gave up after like 15 attempts or something.
[390:53.39]Freed, right?
[390:55.03]Yeah.
[390:56.55]We Mario partied Freed.
[390:57.81]I remember that.
[391:01.17]But I do think Orphan Acast is the hardest just boss they've ever made.
[391:07.87]That is one of the only times I've ever had enough patience.
[391:11.05]Over days and days and days of time.
[391:14.57]I remember even getting... I remember me and Star... We were just summoning each other and we just couldn't fucking do it.
[391:24.96]Even... Trying to co-op that boss was harder than doing it solo.
[391:31.74]Holy shit, it was unbearable.
[391:34.38]So you needed to summon somebody, but he became worse with another person.
[391:39.18]Because he has twice as much health.
[391:43.63]So you had to beat that boss by yourself.
[391:45.77]Or bring in like four people.
[391:48.85]Could you even do that in Bloodborne though?
[391:50.31]I'm not sure you could bring in more than one or two people.
[391:57.22]What makes him so hard?
[391:58.16]He's just relentless.
[391:59.93]He's so fast and he just screams this loud ear-piercing scream with every move.
[392:08.09]He's just so erratic.
[392:09.43]He throws his arms around.
[392:10.89]He gets these wings and he flies across the map.
[392:13.72]Over it is the big lightning.
[392:15.56]He just covers the whole entire ground in lightning.
[392:22.36]Medeir is the same.
[392:23.14]Impossible to do with any summons.
[392:24.74]I tried to beat Medeir with like three people.
[392:28.66]And we still couldn't do it.
[392:33.04]Because, again, that just adds more health to him, and you have to get rid of him quick.
[392:40.56]But yeah, Orphan of Kos, for sure.
[392:42.32]That is the last possible boss you can fight in Bloodborne's DLC.
[392:46.67]It's definitely a challenge.
[392:53.23]But thank you, though, dude.
[392:55.97]Oh, we're almost done here.
[392:58.78]we are at a snuggly thank you snuggly for the one dollar I am vengeance I am the knight I am rat man the lyrics to your song or are get that head shot girl you gotta play team fortress 2 is on its way got star on the colonies 10 million what is that doing that what is he doing that for oh oh okay that's the lyrics to that song I get you do I still play overwatch not at all
[393:28.71]I have not played Overwatch in over a year.
[393:31.85]In fact, you guys may have watched me play it the last time I played.
[393:37.99]But, uh, thank you Twitch Muffin for the two bucks.
[393:39.49]Hey, German Donating Bits, because I don't know any other way.
[393:42.88]Recently landed a job fresh out of high school at my local hospital while I decide on what to do for colleges.
[393:48.44]I attribute having enough moxie to pass my interviews from your charming personality, you cute idiot.
[393:54.71]Thank you for the stream.
[393:57.59]That's an old phrase.
[393:58.43]Moxie, that's an old phrase.
[393:59.95]I haven't heard somebody say that in a long time.
[394:04.24]You know, that's also a soda that is disgusting.
[394:07.70]Try to drink that soda without throwing up.
[394:10.52]It's pretty hard to do.
[394:13.31]But thank you, Twitch Muffin.
[394:14.43]Congratulations on the job.
[394:22.43]I wish you well.
[394:26.60]Dr. Pepper?
[394:27.30]No, Moxie tastes like salt water.
[394:32.39]But it means you got, like, spunk.
[394:35.33]Thank you, Twitch Muffin.
[394:36.11]Thank you, Snuggly, again for the $1.
[394:37.65]You need to sing more in your streams so I can make more weird remixes.
[394:42.37]You're actually not a bad singer.
[394:43.63]Step it up.
[394:44.25]Give the people what they want or don't.
[394:46.31]It's your stream.
[394:47.09]You're the master.
[394:51.12]I can't, like, sing.
[394:52.40]No.
[394:54.08]No.
[394:55.72]I get weird... Like fucking demons possess me and I'm able to sing for like 12 seconds.
[395:05.63]Once I... Okay, I can sing, but once I get to a position where I'm understanding that people are listening to me, I get like embarrassed.
[395:13.61]So I can start off really well and like 10, 20 seconds go by and then I'm like hitting a note and then I'm thinking like, people are listening to this.
[395:22.56]I better like laugh.
[395:24.08]Ha ha.
[395:26.24]So I don't like he'll have it's weird to me.
[395:30.79]I get like embarrassed singing.
[395:45.72]Yeah, once I realize what's happening is when I get, like, nervous.
[395:49.50]So if I did a whole song, halfway through that song, I'd be like, oh, this is stupid.
[395:53.48]That's funny, right?
[395:54.64]I look like an idiot.
[395:55.28]And I would, like, move on.
[395:57.98]Hey, Captain Soviet, thanks for the $1.
[395:59.34]Jeremy, would you do a final meetup with your fellow Bostonians before you move?
[396:04.11]Um, probably not.
[396:07.33]Probably not.
[396:09.24]I've never done, like, a just meetup that was outside of a convention.
[396:14.92]Or a central location where everybody was gonna be.
[396:17.83]I don't really do stuff like that.
[396:25.47]Yeah, I've never done that before, actually, ever.
[396:28.01]So... I probably wouldn't do that now.
[396:34.06]But that doesn't mean that I won't be back for, like, a PAX East again.
[396:38.78]I mean, I have a lot of friends and family around here.
[396:41.42]That I would love to come back and see them and spend like a week, you know?
[396:44.12]I'm not just gonna disappear and never come back.
[396:49.45]But not like an informal kind of just meet and greet.
[396:53.27]I don't... I'm not like really keen on doing that.
[397:02.01]But thank you, Captain Soviet.
[397:04.01]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[397:05.33]When are we gonna see the Surge stream again?
[397:09.12]Oh, I see what you did.
[397:09.77]You spelled it differently so you didn't get caught by the band.
[397:14.71]Thank you StixRenegade for the $1.
[397:16.11]When I watched the new Mr. Rogers documentary, there was a question asking to take a moment thinking of who helped you be who you are.
[397:23.73]I think some of us might list you as one of those people, always making us feel better.
[397:27.37]I know you hear it a lot, but you really are a great person.
[397:31.09]Almost every stream I see people saying how much you help them get through sadness and depression like me.
[397:36.41]When I'm down, I just watch your videos to feel better.
[397:38.87]You're my number one favorite tuber streamer.
[397:41.34]Cheer 100.
[397:46.71]Thank you, sticks.
[397:49.69]Um... That's... Very, very, very kind.
[397:57.09]And we talked about this last week, but... Just knowing that is... You know when they say, like... What's the word I'm looking for here?
[398:11.43]I'm trying to think of, like... Another word for this that's not going to come off as...
[398:17.39]Sounding dumb.
[398:19.35]But... Like, whenever I'm told that... Oh, you're... You're, like, I'm such a fan and... Oh, but you're so funny and stuff like that.
[398:29.60]It... I have to step back and, like, look at it as a whole.
[398:35.40]Because I don't want... I don't want to just think that I'm fucking great.
[398:41.97]I want to keep, like, challenging myself.
[398:45.27]And I think that you can get into dangerous water when you start to just... Oh, everyone says I'm so great.
[398:51.11]It doesn't fucking matter.
[398:51.98]I can do whatever I want.
[398:53.92]And you let your head fill up like a balloon.
[398:55.58]I want to, like, objectively have people still like the things I do.
[399:04.10]So, like, I need to do more.
[399:07.19]I want to do more.
[399:11.40]And I never want to get to a position where I'm just like feeding positive reinforcement into my brain over and over again.
[399:18.48]And I just get like complacent because it's like, oh, what?
[399:20.47]It doesn't matter.
[399:21.05]Like everybody loves me.
[399:21.97]Who cares?
[399:22.45]I don't want to get there.
[399:24.91]Like I'd rather step back and take a look at it.
[399:32.73]But I do appreciate it so much.
[399:36.20]I'm going to keep trying to do things.
[399:38.56]Hopefully they're fun.
[399:42.19]At the end of the day, it's, you know, I want you guys to have fun.
[399:47.43]And I am just a human.
[399:48.63]That's right.
[399:49.03]I'm just a person.
[399:51.83]He dies to pinwheel.
[399:52.85]It doesn't matter.
[399:53.41]Who cares?
[399:53.87]I think a lot of people, when they do shit like this, they like start to soar into the sky.
[400:03.00]And then they don't like look back down.
[400:05.68]They just keep going up in the air.
[400:08.86]I want, like, rocket-fueled wings now.
[400:11.68]Make it happen.
[400:13.26]I don't care.
[400:15.96]Like, when you get to a certain position of, I guess I want to say, like, online notoriety, you can lose a lot of why you started doing it in the first place.
[400:26.12]I actually think it's, I think it's, like, a major problem with, like, online entertainment.
[400:31.28]Is a lot of these people just blew the fuck up and they don't give a, who cares?
[400:41.47]but not to like get deep down into that shit because that's that's a whole another conversation they look down once and they fall like wiley coyote like this this is the type of shit that like I I would have like a glass of whiskey and off stream we would like talk about all kinds of shit
[401:11.38]Because, like, remember, like, I am here.
[401:14.74]Like, I'm on Twitch right now.
[401:16.17]And, like, there's so much shit that, like, we could talk about.
[401:20.51]I'm not talking about, like, to do with Twitch, but just, like, life and videos and content creation.
[401:25.89]Like, I would talk your fucking ear off.
[401:28.29]But just, I don't know if I want to do it on stream.
[401:29.53]You know what I mean?
[401:34.55]Because I have been known to kind of say too many things.
[401:40.01]Not bad things, but just... Once I start going, I don't ever want to, like, piss on somebody else's life or, like, mudsling somebody else's career.
[401:50.92]If you know what I mean here.
[401:54.32]That's the Boston Whiskey Meetup 2018 before I leave.
[402:07.51]But... Thank you so much, Styx.
[402:10.33]I really appreciate it.
[402:11.13]I do.
[402:15.73]Let's do it.
[402:18.23]But then people that aren't 21 wouldn't be able to do it.
[402:23.07]That's... I don't know.
[402:23.81]I wouldn't want to exclude people because if they weren't 21, they wouldn't be able to go to something like that.
[402:30.99]But... We'll think about that.
[402:34.85]Uh, thank you Weeb, thank you Weeb Sama for the one dollar here, thanks man.
[402:39.53]Uh, Magic Mikey, thanks for the one dollar.
[402:42.46]Hey Jerem, I've been a fan since 2011 and you're honestly the greatest content creator on the internet.
[402:47.54]Need proof.
[402:49.12]You can... click on any part of one of your streams and find a reason to puke from laughter.
[402:56.26]But in all seriousness, you've been a huge influence on me and have inspired me to pursue a career on Twitch in the near future.
[403:01.55]Keep up the great work and have a safe move to Vegas.
[403:04.57]Thank you.
[403:07.41]Thank you, Magic Mikey.
[403:09.93]Wish you luck on Twitch.
[403:11.63]It's a dog-eat-dog world here.
[403:16.00]Good luck.
[403:17.34]And thank you for the kind words about the move to Vegas.
[403:20.76]Appreciate that.
[403:25.54]Thank you Tar Alacrin for the one dollar here.
[403:29.07]All these people writing in about lore are actually lying for some reason.
[403:32.89]There is no prophecy about Gwyn having two sons and one daughter.
[403:36.39]That is a complete fabrication.
[403:43.11]Is it?
[403:43.39]Was it?
[403:43.73]That was just a fucking complete lie?
[403:46.93]Are you sure?
[403:52.39]Are you sure about that?
[403:53.31]Like, is that real?
[403:54.61]Whatever.
[403:55.83]Make your own headcanon.
[403:58.61]Hey, Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[403:59.91]A gamer card has been revoked ever since you admitted to not beating Madeer, you garbage gamer.
[404:05.52]How about nobody beat Madeer?
[404:08.70]Let's go look at the PS4 trophies of how many people killed Madeer.
[404:12.24]It's probably 0.002%.
[404:12.62]I'm alright with that.
[404:18.87]Hey, Kroden, thanks for the $1.
[404:19.77]Yeah, it's just hard to find the kind of heart-to-heart conversations in the archives.
[404:24.09]Also, what's your favorite alcoholic beverage?
[404:26.63]My favorite thing to drink is Johnny Walker Blue.
[404:30.31]Just neat.
[404:32.11]That's it.
[404:32.80]Two fingers.
[404:33.30]That's it.
[404:34.52]It's my favorite drink in the world.
[404:43.84]Yes.
[404:44.34]Neat.
[404:44.86]If you don't know, neat means nothing in it.
[404:46.84]Just in a glass.
[404:52.02]Expensive streamer.
[404:52.86]No, that's why I said it's my favorite because like I only get it sometimes Blue labels, okay.
[405:04.37]Well, come on blue labels People give shit to Johnny Walker because it's like a blended whiskey and it's expensive.
[405:11.67]I Love Johnny Walker.
[405:12.47]I think it's great.
[405:18.27]I Do like Johnny Walker
[405:26.58]He only gets it if he's a good boy.
[405:29.67]How do I feel about Miller time?
[405:30.87]I don't drink beer.
[405:33.07]Beer makes me feel like shit.
[405:36.17]I don't like the way beer tastes.
[405:37.65]And if I have more than three, I feel like I'm full of coins.
[405:43.05]So like, no.
[405:44.79]I get too bloated and shitty feeling after like three of them.
[405:51.16]Also, like, it doesn't do well with, like, my colitis, too.
[405:54.67]Just dumping a bunch of fermented alcohol into my stomach.
[405:57.71]It just fucks with me.
[406:02.41]Uh, Beak Beak.
[406:04.03]I hate everyone here.
[406:07.91]Why?
[406:09.67]Why?
[406:10.17]Tell us why.
[406:13.46]Tell us why.
[406:13.94]I want to know why.
[406:15.80]Why?
[406:16.02]Just tell me.
[406:19.95]You have the floor.
[406:20.87]You have the floor right now.
[406:24.55]They didn't buy me an ice cream cone.
[406:28.33]That's understandable.
[406:29.09]I would be mad too.
[406:40.38]That's fair.
[406:41.08]That's fair.
[406:42.72]Alright, moving on.
[406:45.92]Thank you to...
[406:48.52]Sir Feline for the $1.
[406:49.62]Most people don't.
[406:51.80]Uh, poise stack like scrubs.
[406:54.02]Kappa.
[406:54.89]Thank you for the $2, Sir Feline.
[406:57.11]Uh, yes they do.
[406:57.71]Go watch any IGN review of this, uh, of this game.
[407:00.59]Any review.
[407:01.63]Any journalistic approach.
[407:03.97]We already talked about this.
[407:04.91]We've, we've, this is referencing like the first four hours of the stream.
[407:09.89]I guarantee you the guy at GameSpot had like 50 poise.
[407:15.21]On his first playthrough.
[407:19.17]According to Reddit, Dark Eater Medeir is the boss who has the most summons ever.
[407:24.20]Yeah, he was hell.
[407:24.94]He was fucking horrible.
[407:27.84]Hey, thank you, Garfy the Monday Killer, for the $1 Huff Puff.
[407:30.74]I booked it just to make it back home so I could construct a comic for the stream.
[407:33.96]I hate to deprive your viewers of the Garfy goodness.
[407:36.44]I have to leave to go see me out of town buddies, but I came home for a full hour just to make this comic.
[407:41.27]All right, I'm off to see the wizard, Jeremy.
[407:42.93]Have fun with the comic.
[407:45.73]Okay.
[407:45.85]Okay.
[407:48.27]Uh, so this starts panel one.
[407:49.88]Okay.
[407:56.04]So it starts panel one.
[407:57.93]Hey there, Jerma.
[407:58.93]Garfield thought we should return to our old style to keep things fresh.
[408:02.47]Why did you say read our comics if Garf looked like this after all?
[408:06.19]Yeah, I did say that.
[408:07.55]Garfield was way cooler when he was fat and mean.
[408:10.87]A fruitless effort in an attempt to recapture my youth.
[408:14.27]I've only proven to myself how fleeting my mortal life really is.
[408:16.73]There's no escape.
[408:18.41]I hope you enjoyed this clip back into nostalgia, Jermany.
[408:22.37]Got any witty comments to make on the matter, Garfield?
[408:26.03]This is not... I don't like this Garfield comic.
[408:33.28]Yeah, that was a rush job.
[408:36.54]Thank you, Kyra Toby, for the $1.
[408:37.78]Oh, this is the Tomb of Giants clip.
[408:42.36]We watched it already.
[408:44.18]Thank you for that clip.
[408:45.04]Thank you again for this clip, Kyra Toby.
[408:46.44]This one was great from today.
[408:47.62]Let's see this one.
[408:54.23]Let's watch this one.
[408:55.17]This is lights, camera, action.
[408:59.11]I'm alive.
[408:59.51]I'm alive.
[409:00.03]I'm alive.
[409:00.51]I'm alive.
[409:01.49]No, don't eat that drink.
[409:03.53]He's confused.
[409:05.55]Yeah, he's like, what's happening?
[409:06.85]He's confused.
[409:08.13]He's like, I don't know what you want me to do, dude.
[409:12.52]Wait, hold on.
[409:14.00]Is this a safe place, by the way?
[409:16.62]Lights, camera, action.
[409:24.15]Is that actually a safe place to stand?
[409:28.11]Was I just having a panic attack for no reason?
[409:32.78]It is safe.
[409:33.34]Huh.
[409:33.92]Okay.
[409:34.22]Well, that's good to know for the second playthrough.
[409:40.13]Thanks, dude.
[409:45.03]The animation usually happens if you try to use an item that can't be used.
[409:48.36]Yeah, I guess I took, because I put the, I took the green, chewy green, and then I tried to take the Estus too fast, I guess.
[409:58.34]Alright, wrapping it up here.
[410:01.40]Thank you JokerGoat for the $1.
[410:02.76]I wanted to say sorry for the non-original content.
[410:05.65]I did say in chat that it was an internet joke.
[410:09.13]But if I saw it in a video, I just felt like I had the opportunity.
[410:11.61]It was right there.
[410:12.91]Anyways, glad we all had a good laugh at it anyways.
[410:14.67]No, it was a good joke.
[410:15.85]Doesn't matter if it was a joke that's already been used.
[410:17.69]It was a good content, good comedy.
[410:20.66]Thank you, Joker.
[410:22.54]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[410:23.70]Orphan should have just adopted Forehead.
[410:26.68]No, Orphan should have just got adopted Forehead.
[410:36.04]Thank you.
[410:36.48]Thank you, Graveyard Ghoul, for the $5.
[410:38.36]Everyone has asked you about the bosses in our areas, but what is your favorite soundtrack?
[410:42.66]Bloodborne, for sure.
[410:45.30]Nothing can even compare.
[410:48.58]Even remotely to Bloodborne's soundtrack, in my opinion.
[410:54.65]Spreo, thanks for the $1.
[410:57.60]I am bring this back.
[410:58.62]Is hot dog a sandwich?
[411:00.88]We already talked about this.
[411:01.64]It's a subsidiary of the sandwich.
[411:03.14]It's not a sandwich itself.
[411:04.82]It is a subcategory of the sandwich.
[411:07.59]It is a sub sandwich.
[411:10.45]Wonderful telephone.
[411:11.21]Thanks for the $15.50.
[411:12.67]Appreciate that.
[411:13.55]Big money.
[411:15.11]I just got home from waiting enough tables to pay the car note.
[411:17.61]I just paid this month twice over.
[411:21.83]Figured I'd send some of it your way because you're awesome.
[411:25.25]And I'm going to watch the VOD until I pass out so I can do it again tomorrow.
[411:28.85]Now end the damn stream so I can get started.
[411:31.99]We're getting there real quick here.
[411:33.17]Almost done.
[411:34.81]But thank you, Wonderful Telephone, for the $15.50.
[411:36.21]Thank you so much.
[411:41.55]It's a big money drop.
[411:43.51]Hey, Eves, thanks for the $2.45.
[411:44.69]Hey, just jumping on to drop some more bits and just getting leveled to get ready for PvP stream.
[411:52.28]But also, I just wanted to say, because I know you won't be going to conventions in the next year, but at some point, I hope to get to meet you again.
[411:58.17]Because, I don't know, man, that was like the highlight of my packs.
[412:00.45]Thank you.
[412:04.51]It's always the highlight of mine, too.
[412:08.05]Putting faces to, you know, names and seeing who actually watches is very, very interesting to me.
[412:16.40]And I love it to death.
[412:18.11]So it's really, really fun.
[412:20.43]Thank you so much, Eveson.
[412:21.53]I hope to see you again.
[412:24.79]Hey, Raph Mouse, thanks for the $1.
[412:26.67]He shines in the sky, the twinkle in my eye that gives me what a perfect guy at any point in time in history.
[412:33.14]It's a classic from yesteryear.
[412:37.60]Hey, Asher, thank you for the $15, Asher.
[412:41.34]To be honest, it's been a long time since I've caught a stream.
[412:44.44]Disabling notifications may have been a bad idea.
[412:47.33]Anyway, seeing you be happy and finally move from the terrible shithole that is Massachusetts to the terrible shithole that is Nevada.
[412:58.38]Glad to see that you did not stagnate in the time I've been gone and are still growing, not only as a streamer, but as a man.
[413:05.82]I'm pretty sure you've grown an inch here in the... In fact, good on you for that.
[413:10.36]Love you always.
[413:10.92]Thanks.
[413:11.54]Appreciate that, Asher.
[413:16.60]When are we going to lie on one of those stretchy machines so I can get to like 5'9 and be done with this?
[413:23.84]No, looking forward to Nevada.
[413:26.16]I'm in love with the state already, so it should be fun.
[413:28.95]Hey, Eefs, thanks for the $2.45.
[413:30.79]Next time I meet you, I'm going to be bringing you some Johnny Walker Blue.
[413:34.71]Bet.
[413:36.93]Yeah, don't do that.
[413:38.63]Johnny Walker Blue is like $200 a bottle.
[413:41.71]I would be happy with a handshake and a... Hey, what's up, dude?
[413:47.10]One of those.
[413:51.88]It's very expensive.
[413:54.66]But thank you, though.
[413:55.68]Thank you, Crodon, for the $1.
[413:57.18]Wrapping it up here.
[413:57.79]Thank you.
[413:58.13]Also, no joke, you helped me be more accepting of my crones and learning to live with it.
[414:03.85]absolutely more than- more than happy to help you accept the annoying string of diseases that you and I both fall into.
[414:14.02]Again, just keep in mind, it's never gonna go away, but that doesn't mean you can't manage it and can't have a fucking normal life.
[414:24.56]$200 for a bottle?
[414:25.20]That's a little lowball?
[414:28.01]What?
[414:30.27]$200 for a bottle of whiskey is a lot of money.
[414:37.58]Yeah, Kroden, for real.
[414:40.24]IBD sucks.
[414:40.92]If anybody else has IBD, it's not fun.
[414:44.28]But medicine and lifestyle changes can actually do a lot of good.
[414:51.59]That is not there.
[414:52.43]See, bird germa agrees.
[414:56.78]And wrapping it out here, thank you Vice for the $1 and Sprio for the $1.
[415:01.26]Sprio says, have my last bits.
[415:02.80]And Vice says, wanted to jump on the I Love Germa bandwagon and tell you that you're great.
[415:08.26]Watching your streams is like a one-sided friendship.
[415:10.48]It's kind of like you are my best friend and we're hanging out.
[415:13.04]Hope that doesn't come off as too weird.
[415:19.78]No, don't worry.
[415:23.95]Hope it doesn't come off as too weird.
[415:28.69]Well, you know, here's the thing, right?
[415:32.32]The reason why Twitch and YouTube got so popular is because... Everybody just likes to just hang out and watch somebody do something.
[415:46.51]I'm the same way.
[415:49.82]It's something about, it's something very comforting and nice.
[415:54.22]Just watching somebody else do something.
[415:57.82]Now that might be your favorite game.
[415:59.64]That might be watching somebody eat fucking food for all that matters.
[416:04.86]We're in this new type of media where it's not abnormal to think like, oh, this is great.
[416:12.18]I love like watching this person.
[416:15.22]Because we're all, we're people.
[416:17.97]You know, it's really easy to be like Brad Pitt and be like, oh, that's Brad Pitt.
[416:21.33]Leave him alone.
[416:22.69]Don't talk to him.
[416:24.05]He was in that movie one.
[416:25.07]He was in Fight Club.
[416:26.09]Whoa, he's fucking on the red carpet.
[416:27.85]Like, I don't go on a red carpet.
[416:29.83]I'm just a guy that sits here and acts like a dickhead sometimes.
[416:32.54]You know what I mean?
[416:33.70]So it's a different entertainer to watcher relationship.
[416:39.00]Now, here's the thing, though.
[416:41.68]That can also be kind of dangerous.
[416:43.72]right you never want to get too like super attached to somebody that's online because you know the feelings aren't necessarily like completely mutual right like you like honestly I'm not saying that you guys aren't like great people and that I'm really happy to be around you but you got to be careful because that kind of thought process can actually get can really fuck you up
[417:11.73]If you see me as your best friend in the world, just be careful.
[417:18.98]Because you never want to put somebody up on such a pedestal because it's the same thing like, oh, never meet your heroes.
[417:24.66]What if you met me?
[417:26.08]What if you think I'm this awesome person?
[417:27.90]What if you met me and I wasn't what you expected?
[417:34.74]Foreshadowing?
[417:35.54]What am I foreshadowing?
[417:40.64]Everybody that I've ever met in person has been... It's been very, very, very clean and very nice and very... Everyone's been super friendly.
[417:46.99]I've gotten along with a lot of people.
[417:48.43]Actually, some of the people I've met just have... Like, for instance, some of the people that are mods of this channel...
[417:55.15]are people that I've randomly met at a convention or at a get-together that I've never talked to them before ever.
[418:02.02]And we actually became, you know, friends and they've become mods and we talk, you know, it's... You... Just be careful with online personalities and getting it too attached.
[418:12.15]You just have to be careful.
[418:19.57]Streamer's insulting his... I'm not... No, no, no.
[418:21.05]I'm not... I'm not... I just... Just listen to me.
[418:24.11]It's important.
[418:27.86]Does that mean if I stalk you at a con, I can become a mod?
[418:30.48]No, because I didn't even have like a Twitch channel back then.
[418:32.86]I don't think he can be my role model anymore.
[418:43.38]No.
[418:43.82]I really hope you understand what I'm saying.
[418:46.63]Don't construe it.
[418:47.49]Don't put up the giant Burning Man.
[418:52.03]I love you all.
[418:52.83]You're all fucking awesome people.
[418:58.10]Just delete your channel already.
[419:07.55]I got the first heart.
[419:13.25]But no.
[419:13.99]Vice, thank you so much.
[419:15.81]Hearing somebody say something like that is is super fucking encouraging and really nice and makes me feel great.
[419:24.17]I'm glad that you want to sit here and listen to me talk
[419:31.05]I really am.
[419:37.01]Thank you so much, Vice.
[419:41.39]Uh, thank you also to Spreeo for the one dollar.
[419:42.97]I have my last bits.
[419:44.01]Uh, thank you so much.
[419:45.31]Drewbert, thanks for the four dollars.
[419:47.47]Hey, Jerma, sorry I missed the stream.
[419:48.71]Was at a kick-ass fireworks show my uncle put together every year.
[419:52.27]Thought I'd give you the rest of my bits for finishing Dark Souls, though.
[419:54.38]Hope Bed of Chaos wasn't too miserable.
[419:56.14]Have a good night.
[419:56.68]We made it very, very tolerable.
[420:01.68]Very tolerable.
[420:09.86]That's actually the most fun I had tonight.
[420:12.20]Was at that, like, really shit area.
[420:15.30]So, it was a lot of fun.
[420:19.64]Thank you though, Drubert.
[420:20.42]Hope the fireworks show was nice.
[420:21.72]And wrapping it up here at the very end, KyraToby for $1.
[420:24.06]What if I meet Jerma in real life and he's actually not short?
[420:27.03]Never meet your heroes.
[420:27.85]That's actually happened to a few people.
[420:30.46]They met me in real life and they're like, oh shit, you're like kind of like normal sized.
[420:34.40]And I'm like, yeah, I know.
[420:35.36]Do you believe everything on the internet?
[420:41.91]Have a good night, guys.
[420:43.25]Thank you so much for watching.
[420:44.55]Dark Souls is done, but we're going to PvP and do multiplayer on Sunday.
[420:47.71]No stream tomorrow.
[420:48.69]Keep that in mind.
[420:49.38]I'll see you on Sunday afternoon.
[420:52.48]Much love.
[420:53.00]Take care, everybody.
[420:55.10]Have a great rest of your evening and into the morning.
[420:59.59]Why are you quoting office?
[421:01.39]Why are you quoting office?
[421:02.85]No, I want to know why.
[421:03.87]Why are you quoting office?
[421:05.75]I didn't even say office.
[421:07.45]I did not even say office one time in quotes.
[421:09.61]Why are you saying that?
[421:13.67]Office?
[421:17.47]Somebody just wrote this.
[421:21.01]In my office.
[421:22.87]Why would you write that?
[421:23.89]Why would you do that?
[421:24.87]Now, why would you do something like that?
[421:26.49]Now, put this down.
[421:27.62]Why would you do that?
[421:29.22]You're gonna spray me here?
[421:30.66]In the face?
[421:31.17]Then why would you do something like that?
[421:50.61]Go ahead and watch that, that's how I feel.
[422:01.60]Why would you do that?
[422:02.79]Come here.
[422:07.27]Why would you do that?
[422:08.23]Why would you do that?
[422:09.01]Now, why would you do something like that?
[422:10.79]I'm not going to watch that.
[422:15.45]Why?
[422:15.67]Because it says Tom Cruise squirts?
[422:20.72]Oh, God.
[422:21.92]I didn't know that was the time.
[422:22.90]All right.
[422:23.18]Good night, everybody.
[422:23.84]Go to bed.
[422:24.88]I'll see you guys Sunday.
[422:25.74]Take care.
[422:26.10]Much love.
[422:26.56]Good night.
[422:35.71]Good night.
