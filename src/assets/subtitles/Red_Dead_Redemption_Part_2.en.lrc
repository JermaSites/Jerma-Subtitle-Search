[00:51.04]Come on, guys.
[00:51.46]My sister's having a fucking baby this week.
[00:53.26]Come on.
[00:53.60]That's right.
[00:55.14]I'm, like, eating a bunch of eggs.
[00:56.22]Alright.
[00:58.18]Hold on.
[01:22.65]Good evening.
[01:23.45]Happy Tuesday.
[01:25.25]Tuesday the 11th?
[01:28.35]Whatever like time it is.
[01:29.35]Like seven something, whatever.
[01:31.29]Not a big deal.
[01:36.72]Red Bread Invention.
[01:39.88]It is not the game we're playing.
[01:40.82]We're playing Red Dead Redemption.
[01:44.10]I'm going to sneak away for one second while this intro plays, and I will be back very shortly.
[01:51.96]See you in a sec.
[01:52.76]I gotta get my fucking coffee.
[01:54.64]I gotta get my fucking chi.
[01:56.44]I gotta get my chi.
[01:57.84]You know what I mean?
[01:59.27]Come on.
[02:00.17]He's doing a meme.
[02:00.91]I did like a fucking Jerma meme.
[02:02.21]Now I get like an extra ten minutes, right?
[02:03.59]That's how this works?
[02:04.17]I'll be right back.
[03:48.87]Alright, here we go.
[03:50.39]Got everything I need.
[03:51.15]Just put a tweet out saying, hey, yo, stream is going live right now.
[03:55.77]Turn that off.
[03:58.23]Move this over here.
[04:00.68]And look at that.
[04:03.60]We're back in Los Santos.
[04:08.18]300 years ago.
[04:12.45]What's the song for starting thingy?
[04:14.11]It is a song that Blordow made.
[04:17.31]It's a very good tune.
[04:18.55]I highly recommend it.
[04:19.49]Is there a pet dog option?
[04:20.57]There better be.
[04:24.48]This is like a dirty fucking dog.
[04:25.90]Alright, where did we leave off?
[04:31.32]-2.
[04:32.12]I'm not making a joke.
[04:33.36]What is this?
[04:34.80]What's with the skull?
[04:36.02]Oh, it's a Wanted poster.
[04:37.06]Maybe I'll start with this.
[04:39.99]Wanted.
[04:40.87]Charlie Mash.
[04:42.49]Followed Twins game.
[04:43.35]Property destruction.
[04:45.01]Wait, what?
[04:45.41]Somebody needs help.
[04:49.04]What's this guy running from?
[04:55.23]Return the stolen horse to its owner.
[04:56.89]What happened?
[05:00.47]Well, if there's one thing I can tell you, it's that Johnny Macaroni, whatever his name is, is ready to fucking be for the people.
[05:10.69]I have to concentrate for a second.
[05:13.15]There it is.
[05:15.04]I got something in my eye.
[05:21.13]Easy.
[05:23.11]Lasso or get on the horse?
[05:24.33]Can I jump from horse to horse?
[05:26.33]Like a train?
[05:29.67]No, you can't.
[05:31.71]I was trying to see if I could do that.
[05:32.89]Get back over here.
[05:34.75]Come on.
[05:36.70]Come on, come on, come on.
[05:37.30]Don't go on the tracks.
[05:38.06]Don't go on the train tracks.
[05:38.98]What are you thinking?
[05:39.92]Come here.
[05:40.18]Let's start grazing.
[05:41.84]There we go.
[05:42.16]Let's go return the horse.
[05:45.10]Make some money.
[05:49.40]I still have something in my eye.
[05:50.38]Do you ever just want to rip out your eyeball because of something like itchy stuck in your eye?
[05:55.12]I want to take my eyeball out and like itch behind it and then put it back in.
[06:01.59]How come nobody's made a fucking eyeball scoop yet?
[06:03.31]Alright, turn around.
[06:07.47]I use auto-aim?
[06:13.18]I mean, it's a console game.
[06:14.24]What do you want me to do?
[06:14.84]Alright, take your horse.
[06:19.56]Am I gonna get any money for this?
[06:24.42]Prayer.
[06:26.94]Ah, prayer isn't money.
[06:30.31]That's bullshit.
[06:31.03]Where's my money?
[06:31.69]You can't... There we go.
[06:33.15]Okay.
[06:35.91]Nearing a gang hideout.
[06:38.93]It's better than money.
[06:39.81]I'll pray for you.
[06:45.02]How am I near a gang hideout?
[06:46.48]I don't understand that.
[06:49.10]Well, should I go get the bounty?
[06:54.59]Where was he last seen?
[06:57.01]$20 alive, $10 dead.
[06:58.87]That's like nothing.
[07:00.95]Whatever, let's do it.
[07:02.07]I haven't done one of these yet.
[07:07.19]Bounty target was the last seen near Mescalero.
[07:10.95]Let's do it.
[07:13.98]Who needs cash when you have the Lord and Savior?
[07:18.23]Am I riding this dog?
[07:21.27]What does he want?
[07:23.28]Why is he following me?
[07:26.50]Alright, coming up quick.
[07:27.18]Let's go.
[07:31.22]I don't understand inflation.
[07:32.36]Well, considering I just got $18 from that random guy whose horse was stolen.
[07:39.91]Yeah, I do expect getting an actual bounty to be more than $10.
[07:50.33]I haven't picked up any of these herbs either.
[07:52.39]I probably should be.
[07:57.17]Shoot the horse.
[07:57.83]Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[07:59.10]Is this them?
[08:01.52]I think this is them.
[08:03.70]Yeah, this is Wile E. Coyote and his gang of roadrunners.
[08:05.84]I knew it.
[08:07.90]Get off the horse here.
[08:11.41]Ah, they call themselves the fucking roadrunners.
[08:13.95]You can see why.
[08:18.67]No, no, these guys are... Those are nice guys.
[08:20.65]Okay.
[08:23.85]-2?
[08:24.57]Why?
[08:25.65]Come on.
[08:30.44]That wasn't a... You were nearing the bounty's target last... Okay, last known location.
[08:36.70]Howdy.
[08:41.94]Bad joke.
[08:42.68]Alright, easy, easy, easy.
[08:43.70]Now I'm gonna be stealthy about this.
[08:45.08]Because I do want to get him alive.
[08:47.58]Alive.
[08:51.26]Okay, lasso the bounty target to capture him alive.
[08:54.26]He's that guy down there.
[08:55.64]So don't shoot that guy.
[08:58.42]Are there stealth kills in this game?
[09:03.62]Is there a way I can not alert this?
[09:05.00]Where's my silencer?
[09:06.72]Look at that fucking giant frog!
[09:10.74]Oh, no.
[09:14.96]That was a rabbit with big fucking antlers.
[09:25.85]What?
[09:26.79]What the f- What?
[09:27.91]I don't understand that.
[09:30.19]How did he see me?
[09:32.29]I took my knife out, so that means I can be spotted now?
[09:35.52]That's dumb.
[09:37.50]Okay, so he's all the way back there.
[09:46.45]Fucking- Oh god, stick aiming.
[09:49.61]There he is.
[09:50.07]Oh, you're on your horse?
[09:54.17]Don't even matter.
[09:55.25]Got him.
[09:57.19]Come on.
[09:58.25]No, I don't want to pull a horse.
[10:00.32]What am I doing?
[10:02.36]No, no, no, no.
[10:03.14]Don't get dragged.
[10:04.02]Let go.
[10:04.50]Let go.
[10:04.82]Let go.
[10:05.12]Let go.
[10:05.48]Get him.
[10:07.10]Got him.
[10:07.58]Okay, good.
[10:12.20]Easy.
[10:12.38]Okay.
[10:17.85]And we carry him.
[10:19.87]Throw him on the horse.
[10:20.59]Where's my horse?
[10:24.51]Transport the body.
[10:27.87]Is somebody still shooting at me?
[10:34.18]The music is still playing loudly.
[10:35.48]Alright.
[10:39.82]Ride the horse.
[10:42.08]Take him and claim the bounty.
[10:43.88]I want to make money today.
[10:46.31]I lost a lot of money yesterday.
[10:47.70]I was betting money.
[10:48.86]I wasn't making any cash at all.
[10:50.60]I didn't even loot these guys either.
[10:58.36]Who cares?
[11:00.06]Oh, shit.
[11:00.36]There are guys coming after me right now.
[11:03.11]He spoke it and they started appearing.
[11:09.95]Money stream.
[11:11.89]Oh, shit.
[11:12.55]He was not kidding, huh?
[11:16.72]Where?
[11:20.12]Shit.
[11:25.11]Oh my god.
[11:28.03]Why didn't you release this on the PlayStation Portable console?
[11:31.09]PC!
[11:34.15]Got him.
[11:36.79]Got him.
[11:37.07]Okay, weird.
[11:37.49]I don't know who that is.
[11:40.00]Is that a bad guy?
[11:46.45]Use Deadeye.
[11:46.99]I keep forgetting it exists.
[11:48.06]Alright, he's good.
[11:53.44]He's still alive.
[11:54.26]I'm gonna get the big bounty.
[11:55.18]20 bucks.
[11:58.16]Alright, pull it up.
[11:59.14]There he is.
[12:00.14]There's the scum bag.
[12:03.39]Hey, thanks for like the four Mario coins.
[12:13.96]Your bounty amount has been reduced as part of your reward.
[12:15.92]Oh, that's good.
[12:18.52]Maybe it doesn't do that some more.
[12:19.48]I'm gonna go to W. Where am I right now?
[12:25.64]Stagecoach, pay bounty.
[12:26.82]We're not gonna pay the bounty yet.
[12:29.79]We're gonna ride the stagecoach, though.
[12:30.99]Let's hitch this guy.
[12:36.67]You got four Mario coins and ten gamer points.
[12:40.65]That's really what happened.
[12:44.69]Where's that coach?
[12:46.57]This way.
[12:49.71]Over there.
[12:54.15]Why ride the stagecoach?
[12:55.09]I don't know.
[12:56.71]Because the last time I rode it, it didn't go so well.
[13:01.17]Alright, buddy.
[13:05.69]We're going to skip this, too, by the way.
[13:10.60]Hey, thank you.
[13:11.30]Mostly lost with bits.
[13:13.32]Nobody tell him I gave him 25 bits.
[13:15.46]Well, he fucking figured it out.
[13:21.73]Armadillo.
[13:24.59]Thieves landing Armadillo.
[13:28.31]Eight bucks.
[13:31.41]That's a lot of money.
[13:33.77]Why is it so much money?
[13:34.69]That's like more than... That's like 15% of all of my money in my bank account.
[13:47.59]Do you remember the rabbit with the antlers is worth a ton of money?
[13:50.05]It's worth $500,000.
[13:50.37]What?
[13:50.57]No, it's not.
[13:51.37]What are you talking about?
[13:56.27]I had an opportunity to get the jackalope?
[14:00.99]Let's go.
[14:02.31]No fucking around.
[14:02.95]Thank you, Kill Gannon, for your two bucks.
[14:06.75]What store do you go to to spend bits?
[14:08.73]Well, this one.
[14:15.11]I missed it.
[14:16.81]Just change outfits.
[14:17.81]Okay.
[14:18.03]Well, here we are.
[14:19.43]Thanks for the ride.
[14:25.59]What's in the paper?
[14:26.41]Anything?
[14:27.21]Buy current edition paper.
[14:28.49]One dollar.
[14:29.71]Fine.
[14:35.13]Why did I do that?
[14:36.83]What was the point of doing this?
[14:39.75]Hats of distinction for ladies.
[14:41.35]Civil unrest returns to Mexico.
[14:45.83]Stretch Hawthorne, the singing blind grave robber.
[14:51.07]Oh, God.
[14:53.31]Coming soon to Blackwater.
[14:55.83]Nate Johns promises change as governor.
[15:01.24]Who cares?
[15:03.40]Nobody reads the paper anyways.
[15:08.18]Wait, what?
[15:10.44]I hear shooting.
[15:12.38]Is there just a fight going on in the bar?
[15:13.72]Yeah, there is.
[15:15.16]I'm just gonna walk in.
[15:19.13]Dude, what are you doing?
[15:20.03]Wait, there is like a fight going on.
[15:22.17]Are these bandits?
[15:23.65]Holy shit, this is just like Westworld!
[15:26.43]Oh, who's that guy?
[15:27.09]Wait a minute.
[15:28.91]Wait a second, who do-who do they have right now?
[15:32.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:34.33]Come on, come on, horse.
[15:35.81]I'm gonna tail these guys.
[15:40.14]You ran past me.
[15:42.38]Come on, Lightning.
[15:43.72]My horse's name, fucking Lightning.
[15:48.18]What we got, huh?
[15:54.67]Ooh!
[15:56.47]You're free.
[16:02.71]Got it.
[16:03.27]Alright, come here.
[16:04.93]I just got a hundred fucking honor.
[16:06.91]Alright, do I get anything from this guy?
[16:13.04]Oh my god, he almost just got fucking ran over.
[16:16.50]Stop running!
[16:19.64]Jobs in town pay twice as much.
[16:21.23]Holy shit, that's actually pretty awesome.
[16:30.79]Okay, well let's just go back to town.
[16:36.03]Honest Jerma, yep, that's my name.
[16:44.17]Well, I wanted to go to W anyways.
[16:45.85]I need to start looting people, right?
[16:47.86]That's, like, the one major issue I'm having, is I'm not looting anybody.
[16:52.18]I'm missing out on, like, two to three dollars.
[16:59.73]Is that a guy?
[17:00.75]No.
[17:02.19]Over here is a body.
[17:05.37]Put my hands on.
[17:06.05]Hands on him.
[17:08.35]Yeah, nothing.
[17:11.22]Rob the bank.
[17:12.24]Not right now.
[17:12.98]I need to make a decent amount of money before I do anything stupid.
[17:17.90]Four bucks.
[17:20.32]I really need to start doing this.
[17:25.33]It's a loot stream.
[17:31.77]Well, I made back most of my money.
[17:33.07]That's good.
[17:38.87]Horse meat.
[17:39.95]So, horse meat, I just sell it, right?
[17:41.57]There's no... Is there any other purpose besides skinning, like, animals to get their meat to sell?
[17:49.46]Or do you actually need to make clothing with it?
[17:57.96]Get some human skin?
[18:00.22]God.
[18:00.54]Yeah, there's...
[18:06.38]There's always like a random event.
[18:07.90]It's always this one guy, like really, like this guy, always.
[18:20.07]How do I like fucking grab him?
[18:24.37]Alright.
[18:26.59]People like me, right?
[18:29.17]But it's always this one guy, like can we get rid of this guy?
[18:32.59]This guy's a fucking menace.
[18:33.69]Wait, he's still alive.
[18:37.46]What?
[18:38.60]God damn.
[18:39.12]No, no, no.
[18:39.58]He ain't getting away.
[18:42.68]You're like the town fucking criminal.
[18:44.34]Come here.
[18:47.84]We're putting this guy on the train tracks.
[18:56.13]This guy's going on the train tracks.
[18:58.15]My first ever train track.
[19:02.67]There's still people screaming.
[19:05.71]Why is there always an issue?
[19:12.64]This is my first ever guy goes on train tracks kill.
[19:15.80]Let's see if it's as funny and amazing as everybody says it is.
[19:21.40]We have to go find the train first.
[19:25.19]It's about time.
[19:26.29]Alright, come on, lightning.
[19:34.77]Wait, I can bring him in?
[19:38.74]What do you mean?
[19:39.10]Wait, can I turn this guy in?
[19:40.42]Wait.
[19:41.67]Really?
[19:41.87]I want to see.
[19:47.50]If I bring him in here, can I claim a bounty on him or something?
[19:52.24]Let's see.
[19:55.96]If I walk in here and I'm like, look what the cat dragged in.
[20:00.02]Who's going to pay $4 for this sorry son of a bitch?
[20:05.08]I'll take cash or I'll take credit.
[20:08.29]Whatever you got.
[20:11.74]So nobody does anything.
[20:18.05]What if I just put him back here?
[20:24.29]Nobody seems to care.
[20:25.05]Okay.
[20:26.61]Well, then he gets fucking trained.
[20:30.70]Go to the sheriff.
[20:32.92]That's a saloon, not a jail.
[20:38.56]Oh yeah, you know, you're right.
[20:40.06]This is a saloon.
[20:41.46]This is not a jail.
[20:42.48]So take him upstairs.
[20:47.71]What's upstairs?
[20:55.81]I can't, like, do anything with this guy.
[21:01.97]Someone just called me handsome, that's fine.
[21:10.69]There's a train!
[21:11.65]The train!
[21:11.99]The train is coming!
[21:12.65]The train's coming!
[21:13.05]The train's coming!
[21:13.47]I hit the train!
[21:14.73]Fuck, why did I waste all this time?
[21:18.42]Come on!
[21:23.86]What did I just do?
[21:26.96]Wait, what?
[21:27.32]I just bought this room for 50 bucks!
[21:30.65]What?
[21:31.53]Oh, shit.
[21:32.07]Where'd it go?
[21:35.07]Oh my god, I just, like, that guy disappeared.
[21:36.95]I turned that guy in.
[21:42.78]That guy doesn't exist anymore.
[21:44.38]Train!
[21:47.62]Where is it?
[21:57.35]What is this?
[21:59.75]Five Finger Filet?
[22:06.85]Quit, skip, wait, how does this work?
[22:12.34]And you bet large bets are more difficult than smaller bets.
[22:14.50]Alright, let's bet five bucks.
[22:24.28]A, B, B. Alright, so this is him, right?
[22:27.54]Oh, fuck.
[22:27.86]I don't have this memorized.
[22:29.86]I don't have the Xbox 360 controller memorized.
[22:32.83]I gotta look at it.
[22:34.09]A is down here.
[22:45.76]I play mostly on PlayStation, so this is actually hard for me to do.
[23:02.61]I've won.
[23:03.31]Good.
[23:04.92]Now it's his turn.
[23:07.70]It's literally two buttons.
[23:10.34]He's going so much faster than me.
[23:14.73]There goes the train.
[23:16.51]Not bad.
[23:19.01]Just have the table in rhythm.
[23:20.97]I'm gone!
[23:24.39]Fucking god damn it!
[23:27.67]God damn it!
[23:29.28]Do you guys hear all the noise?
[23:31.74]What is with this noise?
[23:36.28]Damn it to hell!
[23:37.84]Hold on, it's a- Mama get it!
[23:39.22]You ain't much good at this.
[23:55.19]It's reloaded It's two buttons I know and like I'm pressing them I don't know how fast I'm supposed to be going I've never done that before
[24:08.96]It's extremely easy.
[24:10.04]I don't know.
[24:11.60]That's the first fucking time I've ever done that.
[24:13.26]What was I supposed to do?
[24:19.47]Like, I don't understand.
[24:20.85]What was I supposed to do?
[24:21.87]Beat the clock?
[24:23.31]Not get hit?
[24:23.77]I don't understand.
[24:25.67]I'll go do that again.
[24:26.39]Hit A, then B. Yeah, that's what I was doing.
[24:45.58]There's nobody here to play.
[24:48.37]There's like free shit in here though.
[24:52.95]Oh no, there's not a chest.
[24:58.67]Is that guy dead?
[25:02.08]I didn't know, but I killed him in like that fucking timeline.
[25:04.46]We were on the game.
[25:08.78]Whatever, I'll come back.
[25:09.64]I didn't even know what the goal of that minigame was.
[25:14.26]Was I supposed to be beating his time?
[25:15.66]Was I supposed to be going fast?
[25:16.74]I don't know.
[25:18.38]I've never fucking played this game before.
[25:20.40]Everyone calm down, okay?
[25:22.75]I'm like four hours into Red Dead.
[25:24.89]I don't even play this game.
[25:26.09]Alright, let's go do a mission while we have time.
[25:45.30]Nice jump, boys.
[25:56.50]I don't believe it.
[25:57.16]No, I just, like, don't... I just don't care.
[25:58.96]I don't care about, like, losing fast five fingers.
[26:03.10]I, like, just press... I pressed A and B a shitload.
[26:05.68]I stabbed myself.
[26:06.57]Whatever.
[26:07.95]We have a fucking Monopoly guy now.
[26:09.43]Everybody, let's move on.
[26:12.92]Ah, Mr. Marston.
[26:14.25]Good to see you.
[26:15.15]How have you been keeping?
[26:15.99]I'm well, Mr... Mr. West Dickens.
[26:20.75]Nigel West Dickens of East Sheep London, New Waverly, New York, and Armadillo, New Austin.
[26:26.61]At your service.
[26:28.67]at my service at everyone's service at the surface of science I hope he's of course I'm joking of course it's a joke it's just a joke how are your wounds much much better but then they would be would be I know a cure for all ailments Mr. marston ah I'm sure you do and I'm sure for just two dollars an ounce
[26:54.75]I could live forever.
[26:56.43]Oh, but for you, sir, I'd do a bulk discount rate of $1.95 an ounce.
[27:02.05]As long as you buy 100 ounces or more.
[27:04.19]That's a lot of immortality.
[27:07.10]Give it up, old man.
[27:08.90]That's Mr. Wes Dickens to you, boy.
[27:12.04]Give it up, old man.
[27:15.10]There are jokes in this stream?
[27:16.54]Not usually.
[27:18.46]Listen, Marston, I'm broke.
[27:21.65]But this stuff is good.
[27:23.13]It works.
[27:24.88]I need a healthy young man like you.
[27:28.41]Come along.
[27:29.11]Let's ride over to my newest customer at Ridgewood, and I'll explain while we go.
[27:34.41]Okay.
[27:37.93]That was a fucking pretty good magic trick he just tried to do there.
[27:41.41]I actually don't even know what that was.
[27:42.83]To Ridgewood Farm!
[27:43.97]The sick and needy await us!
[27:45.43]I guessed it was some kind of fucking spell.
[27:46.93]I don't know what it was.
[27:48.29]Let's go.
[27:56.17]Drive the wagon to Ridgewood Farm.
[28:00.23]And that's how you dog... No, no, no, I'm trying to brake!
[28:02.87]Trying to brake!
[28:03.51]I was holding down right trigger.
[28:06.41]That's how you know you play GTA.
[28:07.90]I was just holding the gas down.
[28:08.92]You're as full of wind as a horse with a collie.
[28:21.92]I have been blessed with the gift of language, and for that I will not apologize.
[28:27.28]But the West Dickens elixirs speak for themselves.
[28:30.68]My thousands of happy customers attest to that.
[28:34.22]Those men trying to kill you didn't look so happy.
[28:36.90]Skepticism is the bastard child of progress, John.
[28:40.68]Knowledge makes a fool into a doubting commerce.
[28:43.86]It's the cross I bear as a pioneer in the fields of commerce and medical research.
[28:50.36]I don't care about this deer, though.
[28:52.95]I don't think I ran the deer over.
[28:54.83]So, is this the guy that has, like, stomach problems?
[29:17.25]I don't like the sound of it.
[29:22.79]Try and stay on the road.
[29:26.14]Well, I'm looking at chat.
[29:28.54]You do know I'm, like, streaming the game, right?
[29:30.48]You want me just to be quiet and fucking not respond to anything in chat?
[29:33.12]Is that what you want?
[29:33.80]You want me to just sit here like this?
[29:36.74]I'm really starting to regret this.
[29:40.11]Content.
[29:40.51]Content.
[29:41.03]Content.
[29:59.70]Such as?
[30:00.28]Oh, nothing out of the ordinary for a man of your line of work, I assure you.
[30:06.50]Best you alight here, dear boy, so no one sees us arriving together.
[30:12.19]Get that content out of my ear.
[30:14.95]I'll see you there.
[30:16.21]Be ready to enchant the crowd.
[30:18.61]Wait, why is he leaving without me?
[30:24.29]What the fuck?
[30:29.45]Oh, I'm going to watch his show.
[30:31.50]Okay.
[30:34.04]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[30:36.28]What was that?
[30:42.18]So he actually is going to put on like a magic show.
[30:43.94]Okay.
[30:46.78]I'm into it.
[30:51.62]Oh no, this is like the potty mouth guy.
[30:59.05]Drinks potty and then whatever it is that he does.
[31:02.57]Gather round, gather round.
[31:05.25]Do you suffer from rheumatism, lumbago, acute chronic sciatic, neurologic or inflammatory pain?
[31:14.74]Well, I represent the only company that makes the genuine article that cures headaches, neuralgia, earache, toothaches.
[31:24.62]Backache, swelling, sprains, sore chest, swelling of the throats, contracted cords and muscles, anxieties and ravaged nerves, stiff joints, wrenches, dislocations, cuts and bruises, and it adds vitality and vigor to the healthy man.
[31:43.08]Can you prove it, old man?
[31:45.18]Oh, I'm sure there's some customer here who could prove the qualities of a spy.
[31:52.14]Take a drink right now.
[31:54.10]You, sir, come up here.
[31:56.12]Step right up.
[31:57.11]Is he pointing at me?
[31:58.23]Oh, so I have to pretend to think that this guy has cool shit, right?
[32:01.98]That's the spirit.
[32:03.32]Ladies and gentlemen, pay close attention.
[32:06.36]This poor, wretched volunteer, entirely unknown to me, will demonstrate the effects of Dr. Wes Dickens' own patent tonic.
[32:17.93]Be you a cowpoke or athlete, this miraculous elixir developed with the wisdom of the East keeps the muscles supple and relaxes the cords.
[32:26.82]It loosens the joints and gives a feeling of youth and vigor to the whole system.
[32:31.36]Not possible, I hear you say.
[32:33.04]Well, doubt no longer.
[32:35.52]Faith can move mountains, but I ask not for faith.
[32:38.46]I am a man of science, and today science will be vindicated.
[32:45.71]Your eyesight has greatly improved, is that not so, friend?
[32:49.42]Yeah, it has.
[32:50.94]Oh, shit.
[32:52.30]That's right, it is.
[32:53.36]You heard him.
[32:54.16]Oh, no.
[32:54.98]What a good sport you are, sir.
[32:57.14]Now, gaze over yonder at that point.
[32:59.28]I gotta make, like, a bunch of shots here.
[33:00.48]If you squint, you may just be able to make out the skull that's hanging there.
[33:04.61]Mm-hmm.
[33:07.43]Go ahead, friend.
[33:08.97]Shoot that skull and demonstrate the miraculous eyesight you now possess.
[33:16.20]Yeah, my eyes do feel a little... You can't shoot him.
[33:22.80]Okay, well, I tried.
[33:24.52]You guys saw me try.
[33:26.36]I tried to turn around and shoot him in the head.
[33:28.26]It didn't work, though.
[33:40.41]Shoot his hat out of the air?
[33:41.89]Oh no.
[33:42.67]Oh shit, I actually have to aim now.
[33:45.01]That's not good.
[33:46.07]But this guy doesn't know.
[33:46.97]Is.
[34:08.15]Yeah, I can do, I know, right?
[34:09.47]One shot can be fired for each bullet in your gun.
[34:11.59]Press right stick while your weapon is drawn to activate that.
[34:17.02]Oh, okay.
[34:21.74]So you just aim at somebody?
[34:23.38]You can just like go over people's heads and do like a McCree?
[34:28.31]Well, they really did like take this whole character from Red Dead, huh?
[34:33.75]I'm just like fucking realizing this.
[34:38.80]A challenge of battle has been offered to our volunteer.
[34:43.34]Look at him!
[34:44.04]The tonic is coursing through his veins!
[34:45.60]What's happening?
[34:47.12]Wait, why am I... Normally, I don't... Wait, wait.
[34:49.70]Punch comes and we fall off with a ground tackle.
[34:54.17]You've got some nerve, Mr. Real Man!
[34:56.97]Got punched in the face.
[34:58.45]The power of an axe!
[35:01.21]Okay, yeah.
[35:01.99]I'll tell ya.
[35:02.45]Can you dodge, too?
[35:09.63]You can defend yourself by pressing... I don't even know what the fuck that just said.
[35:13.97]Right bumper?
[35:15.17]There it is!
[35:16.23]Skeptics and dissenters!
[35:18.35]I got all those prompts that just disappeared too quickly.
[35:20.91]Do not let this opportunity pass you by!
[35:23.83]Look, he's over there!
[35:26.76]Go get him!
[35:27.72]This ends now!
[35:28.84]Watch out!
[35:29.40]He's got a gun!
[35:29.98]He's got a gun!
[35:30.96]Who the hell do you think you are?
[35:33.36]You ain't leaving here alive!
[35:38.36]Once in dead, I target your opponent's gun.
[35:43.62]And... Easy.
[35:48.17]Hold on, did I... Did that potion actually work?
[35:52.71]Is that what's going on?
[35:58.43]So I just drank that guy's fucking weird concoction.
[36:01.22]Now I do actually have superpowers.
[36:04.28]That's what happened.
[36:05.91]No harm in trying one bottle, I suppose.
[36:10.45]Well, I think that went kind of well, don't you?
[36:13.65]I'm just glad that my normal job involves either chasing after cattle or murderers.
[36:18.44]Not the likes of you, mister.
[36:20.26]Don't be like that.
[36:21.96]Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to say my goodbyes and head on back to the real world.
[36:28.29]Wait, sir.
[36:29.31]I've been thinking about your predicament.
[36:31.65]And I think I may have an idea.
[36:33.29]No, you idiot.
[36:33.77]That's just... No, like the fucking like... Like the X's.
[36:37.59]I knew I had Deadeye.
[36:38.53]I'm talking about like the X's that I get now.
[36:41.29]Like the Deadeye X's.
[36:42.55]That wasn't there before.
[36:43.45]I don't rightly get you.
[36:45.53]I want you to go and see my old friend, Seth.
[36:48.90]He can come across as a little curious.
[36:50.96]But I'm sure you two will get on.
[36:53.54]He's most often... I drank a magic potion and I got magic powers.
[36:58.77]That's probably because the tutorial just happens to be after drinking a magic potion.
[37:04.81]Coincidence?
[37:05.51]I don't think so.
[37:06.19]Seth is now on the map.
[37:07.03]There he is right there.
[37:25.15]Wait, what?
[37:25.69]Did he just fucking fall off the horse?
[37:29.76]Where did he go?
[37:30.74]Wait, what?
[37:34.50]Where is he?
[37:35.78]Where did he just go?
[37:41.43]What the fuck was that?
[37:43.43]Oh, and he's not a fucking magician.
[37:45.69]Everybody, now you all look fucking stupid, don't you?
[37:49.65]This guy just threw up, fell off the fucking horse, and disappeared.
[37:56.26]Yeah, I look like an idiot, huh?
[37:58.47]He's a real magician, and everyone wants to talk all this shit?
[38:04.95]What?
[38:05.23]Alright, where's my horse?
[38:13.94]Sorry for not believing.
[38:17.58]That is fucking crazy.
[38:18.52]Okay, where, um... Where's my horse?
[38:22.90]Come on, buddy, let's go.
[38:23.56]Are you inside of here?
[38:34.91]What are you doing back here?
[38:36.63]How did you get back here?
[38:37.69]Okay.
[38:38.93]I'm just gonna jump over the fence and win.
[38:42.21]That was good.
[38:43.77]That was a pretty sick trick that I just did.
[38:51.64]Alright, let's go to S. I'm fucking just talking about magic.
[39:00.30]A lot of magic happening now.
[39:03.99]Where do I want to go?
[39:06.81]Well, the train is that way.
[39:07.85]There's a freaking geek over here.
[39:10.19]There's a freak.
[39:14.28]What?
[39:14.46]Yeah.
[39:14.82]Over there.
[39:18.24]Freaks and weirdos, right?
[39:19.36]That's what it was called in GTA 5.
[39:20.44]Let's see what this fucking weirdo has to say.
[39:28.11]I gotta get the herb.
[39:31.59]We gotta get out of the way so I can get the herb.
[39:33.31]Lightning, sorry.
[39:34.05]Desert sage.
[39:37.91]Okay.
[39:43.78]What's going on over here?
[39:44.50]I just like... I don't know why I just wanted a grenade.
[39:54.57]Okay.
[39:58.72]What are you doing out here?
[39:59.68]Thank you, geology rocks, for the 15 bucks.
[40:01.76]I'm upset you didn't kill Sir Topham Hatt.
[40:03.88]I couldn't.
[40:04.24]He fucking did a ninja smoke thing and disappeared.
[40:07.16]Have I seen you before?
[40:08.80]Oh, yes, I think so.
[40:09.86]Thank you, geology.
[40:10.22]Appreciate it.
[40:11.70]On the train from Blackwater, perhaps.
[40:14.24]Yeah.
[40:15.54]Yeah, you were talking with the preacher.
[40:17.40]Yes, sir, I was.
[40:18.12]Oh, it's a girl from the train.
[40:21.68]I don't know if it's so safe out here, miss.
[40:23.31]Okay.
[40:24.07]Oh, Jenny.
[40:26.47]You can call me Jenny.
[40:27.31]Jenny?
[40:30.06]Whoa.
[40:30.24]Alright.
[40:32.32]Uh, I'm safe because I have faith.
[40:36.04]So, uh, faith can move mountains.
[40:38.84]That's the whole point.
[40:43.59]You're trying to move a mountain?
[40:45.45]Oh, no.
[40:46.55]What a stupid streamer.
[40:47.65]Idiot streamer.
[40:48.37]Like, took that so literally.
[40:49.69]Move a mountain.
[40:50.31]John, John Constantino is a fucking moron.
[40:53.57]Dumb streamer.
[40:54.56]Idiot.
[40:54.80]I know that.
[40:56.38]I know it.
[40:59.00]What's his name?
[40:59.50]Shut up stupid head
[41:27.88]Did I just leave her here?
[41:29.76]Help Jenny by bringing her medicine.
[41:32.61]I got some medicine for you.
[41:35.51]It's called cold steel.
[41:44.10]Wait.
[41:44.94]I do have medicine.
[41:48.48]What did I get?
[41:50.16]Oh, I had it.
[41:50.86]Okay.
[41:53.12]Edgy, I know.
[41:54.40]That's why I didn't do it.
[41:56.28]That's such an edgy shit joke.
[41:57.76]A real streamer would have made that joke, by the way.
[42:00.01]What's wrong with this streamer?
[42:19.58]Is he doing drugs out here in the desert?
[42:23.56]I don't get it.
[42:41.72]Hey, fucking look at that little pond right there.
[42:43.80]Checkmate.
[42:44.62]She's the fucking queen.
[42:45.93]You get checkmate with a pond.
[42:48.03]That is fucking beautiful.
[42:50.21]Look at that one.
[42:52.17]That's a plus five.
[42:54.99]What else do I do?
[42:55.55]Do I just keep giving her medicine?
[43:03.28]Put the knife away.
[43:03.94]I don't get it.
[43:11.55]Better to lose medicine for no reason.
[43:27.79]Put her on the train tracks?
[43:35.77]Jackalope!

[46:42.46]No, I can bring her into like... Oh god, what do I do here?
[46:49.42]This train is the only way.
[46:50.78]Wait, what are you talking about?
[47:07.17]Hold on.
[47:07.47]Does this do something?
[47:13.04]If I try to get him to move, will he like... No, go the other way with her.
[47:26.86]Oh, wait, hold on.
[47:29.84]Oh, shit, there he goes.
[47:32.27]I'm trying to scare him, so she gets knocked up, and it'll be like a funny stream joke.
[47:39.05]Let's go, let's just go, we're going this way.
[47:41.13]Where's the train track?
[47:48.34]Don't kill it.
[47:48.90]I wasn't.
[47:49.20]I'm trying to shoot the ground.
[47:52.62]I wasn't shooting the forest.
[47:53.42]You guys saw that?
[47:59.05]This is kind of a rough ride, though.
[48:04.01]Jackalope!

[48:20.08]Isn't that, like, what that is?
[48:20.84]Haven't you guys, like, seen that on YouTube, like, 30 times now from all your favorite streamers?
[48:27.42]I'm late to the party here.
[48:30.29]I gotta do something else.
[48:31.43]I gotta do something creative, right?
[48:39.43]The tracks are right here.
[48:40.23]Where's the train?
[48:40.89]The train is currently over here.
[48:48.38]So, I mean, we're just going to have to chill then.

[53:02.48]There's an update on this.
[53:03.64]I've been, like, doing this one, right?
[53:09.18]This is, like, part three.
[53:15.50]They just go in a circle.
[53:21.80]First it was the kid, then it was the wife, then it was the husband.
[53:24.72]Are you sure you guys aren't just going to work at separate times and not seeing each other in the house?
[53:32.04]They're always up in the hills.
[53:35.00]What the fuck are you talking about?
[53:35.96]Alright, that's it.
[53:36.54]Get fucking trained, lady.
[53:44.02]This lady's going on the fucking train.
[53:46.10]Every time I go up here, it's just nothing.
[53:49.13]It's just bones.
[53:49.83]Go search for the man.
[53:51.51]The rock.
[53:51.79]Okay.
[53:52.03]I thought that was a bear.
[53:53.91]Glad to see you, partner.
[54:16.18]Maybe he's been visiting the train.
[54:17.30]The train is so boring.
[54:19.58]I know, I don't want to be one of those train streamers.
[54:24.29]We have to find other things to do.
[54:27.11]Like sneaking in the back of somebody's wagon and then not looking.
[54:31.91]Had to be going a little bit faster though.
[54:38.86]I guess I can't go in the back of this.
[54:43.22]Watch another movie.
[54:44.08]Sell the skin.
[54:44.60]Good idea.
[54:45.04]That's a good idea from an extreme perspective.
[54:47.74]What?
[54:48.00]Whoa.
[54:49.55]Hey.
[54:51.07]That scared the fuck out of me.
[54:52.67]I thought he was going to stop biting me.
[54:58.35]I need to go.
[55:01.74]Is there even a general store here?
[55:03.00]Yeah, there is.
[55:04.72]Where is it?
[55:05.74]Gunsmith general store.
[55:16.56]Okay, here you go guys.
[55:19.16]Perfect.
[55:19.46]Yeah, I can do it again.
[55:24.88]I'm not gonna fuck it up this time.
[55:25.92]This time I know what I'm supposed to be doing and I'm gonna get it.
[55:29.68]Here we go.
[55:30.16]Let's go.
[55:44.70]Let's go.
[55:45.26]Here we go.
[55:45.96]A-B-A-B.
[55:47.32]Wait!
[55:48.06]Oh, that's different.
[55:52.48]That's different.
[55:53.00]That was Y. Fuck.
[56:00.50]What?
[56:00.76]Oh, my fucking God.
[56:02.44]I don't know this fucking controller.
[56:04.04]I thought it was A-B-A-B.
[56:05.88]Oh, my God.
[56:09.79]I'm going to lose again.
[56:18.08]I don't play Xbox, so I don't have this muscle memory dump.
[56:20.90]I don't.
[56:24.52]There you go.
[56:30.25]Please don't try this at home.
[56:31.45]Let's see if I can match it.
[56:32.23]I'm a trained professional.
[56:33.85]Those hand-to-hand boys are on the dog again.
[56:36.21]Don't mean nothing.
[56:38.53]Don't fuck me in the face.
[56:40.05]Next time.
[56:43.31]These fucking buttons.
[56:45.55]My finger.
[56:50.20]Why would I do that if I don't have any muscle memory based on what the fucking face buttons of the controller are?
[56:55.71]Why would I do that?
[56:58.49]Oh, I want to skin this guy!
[57:00.11]What the fuck was that?
[57:17.03]I'm gonna skin this guy!
[57:18.29]Alright, let's go, let's go.
[57:22.43]My joke is over.
[57:23.19]You wanna do it in real life?
[57:26.60]I'll do it with like a plastic spoon, alright?
[57:28.42]And I'll show you how fucking good I really am.
[57:37.28]I'm gonna skin this guy!
[57:42.92]No, it's the same fucking guy.
[57:52.01]Alright, are you good?
[57:56.09]Oh, shit.
[57:57.09]Well... Might as well get some of my money back.
[58:02.08]He's a witness now, that's great.
[58:19.05]I gotta get out of here.
[58:20.57]Don't you go to the sheriff.
[58:22.79]Fuck.
[58:24.53]Oh my god.
[58:25.25]I can't be trusted with anything in this game.
[58:27.21]Let's get a really high bounty and try to survive.
[58:36.36]Is that like getting like six stars in this game?
[58:41.98]I'm on the go.
[58:52.39]Let's go change clothes.
[58:55.11]I'm just gonna fucking run.
[58:56.37]Then I'm gonna use a campfire and we're gonna play a game.
[59:01.87]Stop texting me.
[59:03.17]Shut up.
[59:03.55]Leave me alone.
[59:05.63]Stop talking to me.
[59:08.20]Get a fucking life.
[59:09.26]Okay, get up.
[59:22.02]What do you mean a rare cactus?
[59:23.36]What the fuck does that even mean?
[59:33.99]I gotta put my phone on silent.
[59:36.76]I gotta change the text sound.
[59:42.66]Level with me here, guys.
[59:43.40]You guys ever get so angry at that text noise?
[59:49.19]They're like, and it pisses me off sometimes.
[59:52.15]Oh wait, hold on.
[59:53.89]We're like right here.
[59:54.51]Let's do this first.
[60:06.99]It's just like, you're dead!
[60:09.25]Like, quiet.
[60:13.78]Text sound to jackalope sound.
[60:18.73]There's going to be a bot.
[60:19.67]Wait, what is it?
[60:20.25]There's actually a person here.
[60:21.59]Okay.
[60:21.81]Wait, it used to be like bones.
[60:25.63]Okay.
[60:46.43]If I find him, I'll bring him back this way.
[60:48.37]Thank you, mister.
[60:48.95]The reactor core meltdown?
[60:50.01]Yep, I know exactly what sound you're talking about.
[60:55.09]What's wrong with you?
[60:56.13]He's a damn lunatic!
[61:00.18]What?
[61:03.44]That was a pretty sick slide, by the way.
[61:06.50]Is this the same guy?
[61:08.34]I'm so confused right now.
[61:09.38]Alright, tie him.
[61:20.24]Alright, we got him.
[61:26.05]Bring him back.
[61:30.71]Good spin.
[61:32.97]Skate 3 confirmed.
[61:34.11]Alright, this is the guy?
[61:35.05]How could...
[61:41.31]Probably dead.
[61:42.05]Just roll him down a hill.
[61:45.41]I have to do that to somebody.
[61:46.43]Thanks for the idea.
[61:47.93]I gotta get to like a cliff and just fucking bowling ball the guy.
[61:55.30]Wait a minute.
[62:02.60]Stay right here for a second.
[62:07.82]We didn't fucking investigate this.
[62:13.07]What are you doing here?
[62:16.24]How do... I don't know if I like this or not.
[62:29.15]This is not like the husband, is it?
[62:30.47]Let's see how he reacts to like a gentle shove.
[62:36.01]Oh, fucking come on.
[62:44.95]Which one's the husband?
[62:46.37]Oh my fucking god.
[63:06.41]I was looking at the chat and people were saying that it's like a trap.
[63:10.71]Everyone said it was a trap.
[63:11.98]That this was not real.
[63:21.49]Who is fucking shooting at me right now?
[63:24.25]What is going on?
[63:24.96]Who is this?
[63:27.34]What the fuck?
[63:33.04]Who's the bad guy here?
[63:34.74]This guy's just getting chased into the fucking woods.
[63:40.00]What the fuck?
[63:46.34]Listening to chat.
[63:48.31]Everyone in chat was like freaking out about it.
[63:51.51]That's actually pretty cool.
[63:54.47]Whatever, you just sit down here.
[63:56.05]Well, now you're on the horse.
[64:08.62]I just, I have the husband.
[64:11.60]God.
[64:15.40]I'm just gonna cut him free and fucking do it again.
[64:17.74]Come here.
[64:28.17]I'm trying to put him down on the ground.
[64:30.12]Alright, you know what?
[64:30.98]Fuck your husband.
[64:32.88]At this point, like, seriously, I've tried to put him down on the ground fucking three times.
[64:37.88]Fuck off.
[64:39.30]Quest completed.
[64:45.94]What?
[64:51.23]What happened?
[64:53.29]I can't stop the horse.
[64:59.40]I don't have any control of the character right now.
[65:01.22]What the fuck is going on?
[65:05.36]Stop it!
[65:06.86]Stop it!
[65:11.57]Alright.
[65:17.71]This is gonna kill me.
[65:29.22]This game thinks I'm dead.
[65:30.15]It does.
[65:30.79]Let's just go back to Seth.
[65:58.79]Oh, lady.
[66:00.11]Reload?
[66:03.03]Well, who do I care?
[66:07.07]Alright, fine.
[66:07.83]I will do it.
[66:08.90]I'll do it.
[66:09.54]I'll do it.
[66:10.52]I'm gonna reload the game.
[66:11.54]Fucking reload the game, stupid idiot!
[66:26.79]When was this?
[66:34.64]Yeah, I listened to chat the first time.
[66:37.68]I was told, don't trust this guy, he's a bad guy.
[66:40.02]And I was spammed in the chat, so I was like, oh shit, maybe I should fucking push him.
[66:44.41]Let's go.
[67:01.25]What is this?
[67:01.63]Huh?
[67:01.73]Is this like this next part of this?
[67:04.08]Reload busted.
[67:30.71]Let's see if we can refresh it.
[67:32.93]Five dollars will do.
[67:35.52]Or you could run a little errand for me.
[67:39.74]What do you need, dumb?
[67:41.86]It's my wife.
[67:43.90]She packed her things this morning and left.
[67:45.54]The dumb wench is still at the freight station waiting for the stagecoach.
[67:50.72]If you could convince her to take me back.
[67:57.23]Her name's Rose.
[67:58.95]Run the train.
[67:59.71]Pay the musician five dollars and convince his wife to come back to him.
[68:09.12]I don't want to spend any money because I don't have any.
[68:24.91]She's right out here.
[68:25.51]How do I respond to this?
[68:28.07]Nope.
[68:29.07]We got our answer.
[68:47.74]The way I see it, you should give him one last chance.
[68:50.70]Stop bothering me, you dumb cowpoke.
[68:53.32]Or I'll call the marshal.
[68:54.80]Okay.
[68:56.02]Well, that didn't work.
[68:57.88]So, what do I do now?
[69:01.24]Threaten her?
[69:04.72]No, I ain't gonna go down this road again.
[69:06.34]Like, every time I go down this road, I'm... Yeah, take the five dollar bill.
[69:13.02]I got, like, other shit to do.
[69:14.34]Yeah.
[69:17.46]Here, just take five bucks.
[69:18.60]You should do it.
[69:19.28]No, I'm not listening to chat anymore.
[69:22.39]It just gets me in trouble.
[69:23.87]I'm gonna play my way.
[69:24.65]Or the fucking highway.
[69:45.83]That's where he'd be, I guess.
[69:48.08]God dammit.
[69:48.86]Where's this?
[69:49.72]Over here.
[69:50.36]Let's go to it.
[69:51.22]Over here, buddy.
[69:53.62]We're here to help.
[69:56.08]Let me do this first, though.
[70:21.28]get honest to god like that guy this guy seriously calm down what the fuck dude what are you me that's the shit
[70:37.88]What is happening right now?
[70:41.14]Alright, I ain't gonna get involved.
[70:47.47]Horse hide, buck antlers, these are nice.
[70:52.37]Rabbit meat, horse hide, horse meat, desert sage.
[70:54.93]I mean, I don't really care.
[71:10.84]One dollar for Sage.
[71:18.42]What a good natured guy.
[71:23.26]What else do you have?
[71:25.66]Rabbit's Foot.
[71:26.20]These are like treasure maps, right?
[71:27.26]What does this do?
[71:27.72]Chris, the items and money you loot by 20%.
[71:30.38]That's actually really cool.
[71:42.63]Is that worth me just having?
[71:43.61]Is this a permanent item?
[71:44.49]Train this guy.
[71:50.97]Probably should just get it.
[71:52.93]Yeah, I'll get it.
[71:54.03]Well.
[71:54.15]Alright, buddy.
[71:54.55]I'll take that casual racism and just go this way.
[72:16.55]What do I want to do?
[72:21.17]I do want to go to do that thing.
[72:26.66]That thing that's over here.
[72:33.23]I wasn't even close.
[72:35.27]I blew that lady down with the wind of me going by her, by the way.
[72:40.91]It was not even close.
[73:03.00]Bandits?
[73:05.38]Doesn't seem like it.
[73:09.13]I love these randomly spawning, strange, insane riders that are just all over the place.
[73:15.15]Are we going to, like, the same place?
[73:21.71]Okay.
[73:26.98]Dead guy.
[73:27.68]We're gonna dig in a guy's grave, I think.
[73:31.80]Let's see what we can find in here.
[73:36.36]Peter Turner, betrothed to Miss Alma Horlick.
[73:38.81]Killed by a blow to the head on the 15th of January, 1894.
[73:41.77]He will never dance with another.
[73:43.29]Is that right?
[73:48.61]I made 100 honor points.
[74:02.71]Alright, well, that's cool.
[74:04.17]I hear gunfire.
[74:10.29]It's over there.
[74:11.91]Whatever the hell it is.
[74:13.05]Alright, let's go... Did we reach that point?
[74:22.28]Oh, we're in sub only?
[74:23.82]Did we lose our minds?
[74:32.29]What do I want to go?
[74:34.57]We're going to... I'm going to go to S, right?
[74:40.75]Where's Seth?
[74:41.27]There he is.
[74:42.37]So, Armadillo.
[74:46.43]Armadillo!
[74:47.81]Let's go.
[74:48.21]It got bad.
[74:54.90]Oh, God.
[75:04.17]Sub only!
[75:05.21]That is true.
[75:07.53]That was worth like four dollars.
[75:09.35]Herbert Moon?
[75:09.93]I thought, didn't he just say he's Herbert Moon?
[75:37.60]I thought he was announcing himself.
[75:47.44]Loot the fucking body.
[75:48.34]I ain't gonna spend any time doing this shit.
[75:50.00]Just give me the money.
[75:53.42]Whoa!
[75:54.24]Wow!
[75:55.57]Wow, that was $49.
[76:05.07]He got away.
[76:05.61]I don't know where he went.
[76:06.55]He got away.
[76:12.76]I tried to get him.
[76:13.74]He was too fast.
[76:16.10]He had a super horse.
[76:18.20]Did you see that thing?
[76:19.48]Who cares?
[76:23.67]My honor's already fine.
[76:24.73]I got like plus 50.
[76:26.47]My alignment's like good neutral.
[76:28.85]I'm fine.
[76:36.24]Plus that was like way too much money to not have.
[76:41.43]But yeah, thank you, Irish, for the $2.50.
[76:45.30]Don't ignore me.
[76:46.38]What do you mean, ignore you?
[76:49.70]Thanks a lot.
[76:50.36]Controlled Couch Fire, thanks for the bits as well.
[76:52.42]Irish again, thank you.
[76:53.56]Well, this is what he's talking about.
[76:56.10]Your humor has been rubbing off on me, and my friends actually find me funnier.
[76:59.20]Well, I'm glad that that's the case.
[77:05.96]I need your help, Seth.
[77:07.94]Thanks for the money.
[77:08.78]We need your help.
[77:10.18]Me and Mr. Wes Dickens.
[77:11.67]Let me be Frank for one second, partner.
[77:13.33]I hate people.
[77:15.59]It was people who got me in this mess in the first place.
[77:18.77]What mess?
[77:20.79]Look at me.
[77:21.69]Look.
[77:22.27]Scramming around.
[77:23.53]Looking for maps.
[77:24.27]Half insane.
[77:25.41]I ain't washed in six weeks.
[77:26.45]Half insane.
[77:26.99]My hair falling out.
[77:27.97]My mind's going.
[77:30.49]What happened?
[77:33.00]What happened?
[77:34.34]My partner...
[77:35.80]He stole half my map.
[77:37.58]I never would have done that to him.
[77:39.66]Never.
[77:40.85]Look at me.
[77:43.65]Who did this to you?
[77:44.95]My partner.
[77:46.37]My boy.
[77:46.91]My man.
[77:48.43]Moses Ford.
[77:51.01]I don't have the facility to tell you what I would have done for that man.
[77:54.99]And what I would do to him now.
[77:56.26]Why?
[77:56.36]Because he stole half my goddamn map.
[78:04.99]I'm drowning.
[78:05.33]Haha, freedom.
[78:30.83]I can't swim.
[78:31.89]I can't swim.
[78:36.19]Help me.
[78:37.73]Why are you hiding?
[78:42.52]Am I going to play Undead Nightmare?
[78:46.22]Maybe.
[78:46.96]Depends on how much I keep streaming this.
[78:49.86]Maybe.
[78:51.50]I'm enjoying the game so far.
[78:52.50]I'm having a lot of fun, so maybe.
[78:54.30]Then maybe you'll help me.
[79:07.69]I thought that wasn't Seth the fat magician?
[79:14.54]I thought he was like the fucking magician guy.
[79:24.10]Don't trust him.
[79:24.72]Push him too.
[79:25.20]Come on, you guys gotta give me a break.
[79:27.00]That might not have been the smartest idea.
[79:30.47]But how was I supposed to know that literally a tiny little shove was going to fail the quest?
[79:36.81]I just gave him a little shove.
[79:38.53]That could have been a buddy shove.
[79:40.34]How many of you guys do a buddy shove with some of your buddies?
[79:44.46]You, like, push him.
[79:45.24]Like, hey, come on, man.
[79:46.24]Shut up.
[79:46.60]But what?
[79:46.86]That's enough to fail a mission?
[79:48.58]That doesn't fail a friendship.
[79:50.22]That improves a friendship.
[79:51.30]You wouldn't push, like, somebody with a broken leg.
[79:53.40]Yes, I would.
[79:53.66]Maybe we were, like, joking around and...
[80:12.38]You know, he's on crutches, and he makes like a snarky remark, and I just fucking push him, and he like fucking tumbles down like brick.
[80:17.86]Ow!
[80:18.04]Like, ow, that would do that.
[80:26.91]I told you, I'm not listening to chat.
[80:29.49]I'm gonna make my own decision.
[80:31.97]I'm not gonna look over and see, like, shoot the horse, shoot the horse.
[80:54.08]Because guess what?
[80:55.02]I ain't gonna shoot the fucking horse.
[80:56.44]I'm not gonna shoot the horse.
[80:57.76]The horse is gonna stay alive.
[80:58.88]Why are we stopping?
[81:00.06]What's that for?
[81:00.62]Alright.
[81:00.82]We just have to stop for a minute.
[81:02.08]Give our horses a break.
[81:28.02]We're trying to find a treasure map.
[81:28.92]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[81:30.46]I'm just going for a fucking... Slow down.
[81:33.18]Slow down.
[82:00.49]Shooting the other guy's horse do anything.
[82:01.91]Yeah, kills the guy on the horse and ends the mission.
[82:06.07]You all just want to see me fail, so I have to go back and do it again.
[82:09.39]Is this a vodcast?
[82:13.21]No, this is not a vodcast.
[82:14.74]By the way, by the way, you're never going to see a vodcast from me.
[82:21.40]Alright, this is it.
[82:22.92]Let's stop here a moment and come up with a plan.
[82:25.00]In my opinion, a vodcast is, hey, let me restream my stream I already did.
[82:28.88]So, like, I have, like, permanent stream going.
[82:32.54]So, like, there's always money that rolls in.
[82:35.90]That's an opinion of mine.
[82:37.04]I'm allowed to have one.
[82:37.66]A vodcast is where you broadcast your stream you did, like, a day before.
[82:40.52]That's it.
[82:54.78]You stream your stream that was streamed earlier.
[82:58.40]The VOD exists.
[82:59.24]You can just go watch it.
[83:02.50]It's to make it so you're constantly on the Twitch menu or something.
[83:05.64]I don't know what the fuck people are doing with their fucking weird-ass lives.
[83:16.78]I steal a deputy's horse to become wanted.
[83:18.58]So I have to... Oh.
[83:19.22]Alright.
[83:21.67]I mean, that's one easy way.
[83:24.33]What's going on here?
[83:26.14]I didn't do anything.
[83:28.32]Alright, I'll stay away from the animals.
[83:45.24]Okay, now he doesn't seem to care anymore.
[83:47.92]Get away from them horses!
[83:48.90]Get away from them horses!
[83:51.05]I'm going to do it the right way.
[83:53.91]I'm going to do it the way I'm supposed to do it.
[84:01.11]Get away.
[84:04.28]Deadeye everything but yourself?
[84:13.80]145.
[84:13.96]Yeah, we've done a few crimes.
[84:24.30]Podcasts are for people in time zones that can't watch live, can watch together.
[84:28.90]See, that's like what it is on paper.
[84:33.00]That is what it is on paper.
[84:43.93]Why listen to chat when you're just going to do all the stuff we want you to do anyways?
[84:53.12]game is beautiful it is very beautiful let's go I just don't understand why like alright here's my here's my problem with like podcasting and like restreaming like rebroadcasting I'm gonna pause for this why not just make it so like
[85:19.65]you can, like, chat while watching a VOD.
[85:22.43]Some of these big streamers, some of these really, really popular streamers will have who knows how many people at any given moment watching one of their past VODs.
[85:31.43]I mean, I guess, like, because it's being, like, broadcasted and it's, like, live, I guess that makes sense, but... I mean... The screenshot is kind of fucked up.
[85:45.98]I should VODcast this.
[85:53.20]His little, like, hand motions were perfect.
[85:55.08]It wouldn't be, like, in sync.
[85:58.76]I guess, but, like... It's not live.
[86:02.38]It's not a live stream.
[86:05.17]It's like you streaming a YouTube video.
[86:07.53]Alright, no more screenshot.
[86:22.30]Get that slippery bastard.
[86:24.20]I need him alive, though.
[86:25.90]Lasso.
[86:26.40]Just leave me alone.
[86:29.65]Lasso Moses.
[86:35.39]You ain't the damn boss.
[86:36.41]I think he's faster than me.
[86:37.51]No, he's not.
[86:38.07]Come here.
[86:39.07]God damn you.
[86:40.77]He's better than a bard.
[86:41.61]I'm flying to you, mister.
[86:50.05]But I'm gonna give you an opinion on channel growth.
[86:55.80]We'll talk about channel growth.
[86:58.31]So let's say you got a streamer that has a lot of people that watch, right?
[87:02.47]And they're broadcasts.
[87:05.11]And a lot of people are watching.
[87:06.35]And those people that are watching also may have, you know, other follows or other subscriptions or something that they care about.
[87:14.98]You almost like permanently have like somebody like up on like the top of Twitch or in like the middle of Twitch that like is not live.
[87:22.07]So if you have, like, a small streamer that has, like, you know, 100 viewers or 200 viewers, they're the ones that lose out from vodcasting because, you know, there's always going to be these channels, like, permanently live.
[87:32.35]Does that make any sense?
[87:35.54]I can't just step up the stairs?
[87:40.62]The tracks are right there.
[87:44.28]Yeah, they are.
[87:45.12]Well, we aren't doing that.
[87:48.46]We aren't doing that.
[87:51.77]Alright, here.
[87:52.45]Buddy shoving.
[88:06.29]I'm not buddy shoving this guy.
[88:07.61]Then I'm gonna cut you up piece by piece.
[88:13.35]Till you find your tongue.
[88:14.93]Friend, this man's gone crazy.
[88:16.05]The horse is on the chat.
[88:17.17]I suggest you take my advice and start talking.
[88:19.57]Shut up, Marston.
[88:21.03]I want to cut into a bonafide man's flesh.
[88:23.35]Ain't never cut into a lot of one before.
[88:28.86]Odd fellow's rest.
[88:30.50]It's an odd fellow's rest.
[88:32.96]Get away from me once and for all.
[88:34.86]It kind of does look like Mr. Sneakman.
[88:36.00]He peed his pants.
[88:37.56]Laugh at him.
[88:37.90]Good cop, bad cop routine.
[88:42.20]Yeah.
[88:42.32]Pretty much is a good cop, bad cop routine.
[88:44.32]Yeah.
[89:06.36]Loud pee.
[89:13.98]No, I ain't fucking this up.
[89:20.45]This is like a long quest.
[89:21.55]We're not doing this anymore.
[89:24.97]This is too long.
[89:25.73]I was gonna cut him free and make a joke or something, but no.
[89:31.62]I don't have enough money.
[89:33.66]to do this.
[89:33.90]Pay off my bounty?
[89:34.56]I don't have enough money to do this.
[89:36.06]Oh, okay, good.
[89:36.66]Thanks, dude.
[89:36.96]That was good.
[89:52.57]We're playing it serious now.
[89:53.75]We're playing it boring.
[89:56.97]When I play the game normally, everyone says it's boring.
[89:59.59]When I do crazy shit, people say, you're an idiot.
[90:01.94]Why didn't you do it the right way?
[90:03.62]You can't win.
[90:04.48]There's no winning.
[90:05.64]There's no victory.
[90:08.64]I don't get a victory.
[90:09.40]Am I going to play the movies again?
[90:16.71]I don't know.
[90:22.44]Buy a bandana, then do crazy shit.
[90:27.71]Boring idiot.
[90:29.23]You chose this life.
[90:31.55]Whoa, freaking geek.
[90:33.23]Let's see what it is.
[90:37.43]Is it the guy in the bounty office?
[90:39.41]Huh?
[90:40.05]Alright, talk to the man.
[90:51.05]It's train time.
[90:51.71]I have two accounts.
[90:52.15]One for funny and one for game.
[90:53.11]That's so... That is so stupid.
[91:13.15]You want me to buddy shove this guy?
[91:36.42]I did buy a property, though.
[91:37.60]Being a fucking creep.
[91:38.86]Being a weirdo.
[91:39.22]Second time.
[92:02.40]Sending them my oh-so-witty and oh-so-pertinent missus.
[92:06.66]And gave myself a little prize in the bargain.
[92:09.30]So it's action I'm after, and action I'm gonna find, too.
[92:13.79]Wild men, cheap women, guns, that sort of thing.
[92:21.87]Well, you have fun.
[92:23.41]Fun?
[92:25.29]I'm gonna have the time of my life, sport.
[92:28.27]Sport?
[92:28.89]Do you think I'm like 19?
[92:29.73]What am I, like 16?
[92:30.09]Funny man journal entry.
[92:31.27]What?
[92:31.45]What do you mean funny man?
[92:34.48]Funny man?
[92:54.62]Okay, well, I'm gonna assume this guy pops up later.
[93:02.98]You think you're fucking funnier than me?
[93:07.33]I'm the one with the comedy stream.
[93:08.89]I'll show you, motherfucker.
[93:09.97]Just wait till this guy's, like, not looking.
[93:14.95]I'm the fucking comedy gamer here.
[93:17.40]Says it in my, like, fucking about me section.
[93:20.46]It says, just chilling, trying to, like, do my thing and make a bunch of jokes while I'm at it.
[93:28.94]Why did I do that?
[93:30.18]Why the fuck did I do that?
[93:32.33]That was, like, so fucking dumb.
[93:34.45]I wasn't on a quest.
[93:35.69]I didn't know I was on a quest.
[93:39.03]Oh my fucking God.
[93:40.63]Like, I didn't know I was on a quest.
[93:42.42]I seriously swear to fucking God.
[93:44.50]I thought that was done with and I could just come back, but it's over now.
[93:46.92]That's good.
[93:47.64]Alright, well.
[93:51.00]Hold on.
[93:56.11]I really thought that that wasn't... Funny Man is...
[94:06.73]It's a joke stream.
[94:08.37]No, it's not a joke stream, actually.
[94:11.34]It's not supposed to be.
[94:12.38]If Jerma can't be funny, man, nobody can.
[94:19.28]Ah, just play normally, fuck you!
[94:21.14]Where's the- this is boring!
[94:23.18]Jealous high IQ streamer bullies helpless comedian.
[94:26.86]No.
[94:28.04]Kill Twitch account, try again, funny failing.
[94:31.30]Should put him on the train.
[94:32.28]Oh, speaking of trains, here comes the train.
[94:34.44]You thought I wasn't gonna see it.
[94:57.56]Hey, good thing that wasn't my horse.
[95:04.36]That wasn't my horse.
[95:05.86]My horse is fine.
[95:12.78]Wait, I can get in the train?
[95:16.48]Oh shit, I can get in the train.
[95:19.02]Oh, wow, this is awesome.
[95:20.30]I don't think this is even possible.
[95:22.99]Climb up?
[95:23.87]Climb up what?
[95:26.15]Are you fucking kidding me?
[95:30.27]I can get on top of the train.
[95:31.91]That's really cool.
[95:38.14]Uh... I can make it move, right?
[95:42.00]Is there a way I can make it move?
[95:45.52]I can rob the train.
[95:46.44]Is that...
[95:49.92]Will it just sit here?
[95:51.72]Do I have, like, time?
[95:52.54]What's this guy doing?
[96:03.59]That's such an odd way to sit.
[96:04.97]This guy's, like, trying to sit, but his leg is, like, fucking... What is that?
[96:21.61]Alright, well, that was, that worked, that was cool.
[96:36.33]Okay.
[96:36.43]He said he won't fucking go off the train.
[96:38.49]Get off the fucking train!
[96:42.35]Why?
[96:44.32]Won't you just do what I want you to do?
[96:47.41]He keeps getting sucked back in.
[96:49.79]There he goes, finally.
[96:51.21]Nope, he's back.
[96:54.67]His brain and body refuse to let him fall off this fucking train.
[97:00.73]Like, what does it take?
[97:02.11]The fuck does it take?
[97:03.37]That's what it takes!
[97:04.74]Apparently.
[97:06.90]That's what it takes.
[97:07.72]Oh, the train stopped.
[97:08.96]What?!
[97:14.16]Uh, I don't think this is your stop.
[97:19.82]Can I drive the train?
[97:30.57]I don't think I can drive it.
[97:35.05]Oh well.
[97:39.67]Now you want to fight me.
[97:40.73]You want to, like, punch me.
[97:43.67]Your precious fucking train ride stopped.
[97:45.47]Now I want to die.
[97:49.64]Without somebody running the train, the train stopped.
[97:51.22]Yeah, well, how come he fell off the train like nine times?
[98:01.25]What do I do to this guy to make this interesting?
[98:09.39]He's not scared of this.
[98:10.81]Okay.
[98:13.24]He's not scared.
[98:17.68]He's the witness.
[98:18.86]I know.
[98:19.76]Yes, you're looking right at me.
[98:22.20]Which one's the witness?
[98:22.90]Is it him or him?
[98:24.97]I think it's him.
[98:29.09]I can't lasso anybody?
[98:30.05]Why not?
[98:32.95]That's weird.
[98:35.41]Okay.
[98:35.75]Time to leave.
[98:47.57]Lasso somebody and then get on the train.
[98:51.45]So this won't move.
[98:53.19]No matter what.
[98:53.93]I can't move it.
[98:57.64]I don't think I can make the train move.
[99:00.16]The chest in the train.
[99:04.00]Is it really?
[99:04.42]This guy's trying to get out the window.
[99:12.38]That's not going to work.
[99:13.18]You can't fit out there, man.
[99:14.14]You're a grown man.
[99:14.85]Deal with it.
[99:19.36]I didn't kill this guy.
[99:22.72]Wait, is this the conductor?
[99:24.88]Why is he dead back here?
[99:28.72]How many people died on this train?
[99:30.04]I can't open this crate?
[99:44.33]Alright, well.
[99:47.36]He's bound to this place forever.
[99:52.84]I'm assuming you can rob the train, but where's the stuff to rob?
[99:56.14]Alright, we'll fuck it.
[100:02.11]Whatever.
[100:04.35]Let's just go.
[100:09.01]Wait, I can shoot that open.
[100:14.76]I can open that crack.
[100:15.48]I actually can open it.
[100:16.28]Is it really?
[100:16.80]It feels like... Well, this is not the same one, but... Okay, that can't be opened.
[100:27.65]Just shoot the box.
[100:29.29]Alright, well, let's see if it works.
[100:37.65]Uh, where was it?
[100:38.17]Right here?
[100:46.28]I didn't do anything.
[100:49.50]Why am I listening to chat?
[100:51.02]I said I would never do that again.
[100:57.76]I said I was never gonna do that shit again, and I did.
[101:06.49]What happened?
[101:06.97]Is this guy gonna put his fists up in the air?
[101:12.65]He wants to get up here.
[101:14.05]I think he wants to drive the train.
[101:16.49]There's no way to drive train.
[101:17.75]I gotta just go.

[107:13.93]Why does it get in the wagon?
[107:15.21]Isn't this quest over?
[107:16.33]Why do I have to turn it in?

[112:16.06]Deliver an empty fucking thing and then shoot him.
[112:20.06]Exit the wagon.
[112:20.80]Am I gonna get inspected?
[112:22.94]Talk to the banker.
[112:24.73]Okay, you're welcome.
[112:30.29]Here's your safe.
[112:36.73]Solomon's finally complete.
[112:43.63]And he gave me four dollars.
[112:46.72]Thanks, man.
[112:49.33]I appreciate the four dollars.
[112:51.99]I got a pardon letter.

[113:34.84]We're going to complete Seth's little arc here.
[113:45.27]We already watched the movie last time.
[113:46.83]Go buy a bandana.
[113:57.40]Can't jump that ship?
[113:58.48]Why not?
[114:06.04]When do I unlock Nitro?
[114:07.70]I don't know.
[114:09.21]More grave robberies.
[114:10.25]This is great.
[114:11.93]Killed ten people for four dollars.
[114:14.69]You mean I got, like, seventy-two dollars.
[114:24.64]I robbed a safe.
[114:25.30]What's up with this guy's eyes?
[114:26.44]This guy has like some weird disease.
[114:48.17]She really does have golem eyes.
[114:49.31]Fucking smoke.
[114:49.77]Alright, would you rather have this guy
[115:14.89]gnaw on your arm like a corn on the cob.
[115:18.38]You know what I mean?
[115:18.84]Just like... He's not even, like, going that hard.
[115:21.98]He's just gonna do, like, a little corn on the cob, like, gnaw on your arm.
[115:26.18]Or, uh, splash, like, take your fingers and, like, dip into, like, a jar of his piss and, like, turn your hands and just, like, flick, like, splash a little piss in your face.
[115:35.85]Which one?
[115:38.33]I'm gonna take him back to a nice, quiet spot and look for the map.
[115:43.13]I might, I don't know, I might have to do the piss.
[115:44.57]I do both.
[115:46.45]Get in the wagon.
[115:48.69]Alright, let's do it.
[115:50.20]Ugh.
[116:15.76]That was, I mean, it's over here.
[116:18.40]I kind of want to take it off, bro.
[116:24.74]As long as we can move quickly.
[116:30.42]Let me roll through town.
[116:38.13]Oh, dear.
[116:39.13]Here comes the train.
[116:40.47]Oh, the train.
[116:40.79]Get out of the way, bird.
[116:42.23]Come on.
[116:42.49]Come on.

[116:43.17]We're going to beat the train.
[116:44.31]Come on.
[117:02.96]We gotta get to the train.
[117:15.31]Oh shit, no, I want to ride next to the train.
[117:17.37]What are they doing?
[117:21.56]What?
[117:23.70]How?
[117:24.54]How the fuck is that possible?
[117:26.54]They drove right into it.
[117:30.40]God, I can't move.
[117:35.53]I'm just stuck.
[117:36.55]They're out of fucking way.
[117:42.61]So, I guess this is goodbye.
[117:47.54]He's gonna die.
[117:48.78]Yeah, that was a nice, like, fucking bird impression.
[117:58.37]Like, bugs.
[117:59.53]Well, actually, you know, I can just use this as cover, can't I?
[118:04.79]Kind of.
[118:05.41]Oh, god.
[118:18.40]I don't even know who's a bad guy anymore.
[118:37.04]Who are these people?
[118:38.38]It's not a bad guy.
[118:39.62]What the fuck?
[118:44.96]What the fuck happened?
[118:46.10]I'm so fucking confused.
[118:52.24]Oh, chest!

[119:49.16]See that?
[119:55.00]Looks like the treasure's in Tumbleweed.
[119:56.76]That's where I was headed.
[119:58.06]It's fate.
[119:58.92]Keep going.
[119:59.72]We're almost there.
[120:02.98]Drive to Tumbleweed.
[120:05.37]Can't you see we're in a rush here?
[120:08.96]It's like a pub battlegrounds moment.
[120:11.64]You flip the thing over, you're done.
[120:12.90]Is the treasure three bucks?
[120:20.42]I hope it's more than five dollars.
[120:22.89]I'm gonna Jedi these guys.
[120:29.09]I'm not.
[120:30.49]Actually, yeah, why not?

[121:07.29]I don't want to do this whole mission again.
[121:08.97]It's a long one.
[121:19.15]Oh, my.

[122:15.08]Looks pretty abandoned.

[125:17.55]Come on, that would have given him some... Come here.
[125:23.13]Are these, like, just generating?
[125:45.02]If I sit here, will it keep generating birds?
[125:48.85]I got an extra rank.
[125:53.79]Let's go.
[125:59.84]Sharpshooter challenges.
[126:00.90]Okay, cool.
[126:04.62]God, I wasn't paying attention.
[126:13.69]I wanna check the store.
[126:15.67]Like, the shop.
[126:16.19]If there's any new weapons.
[126:18.81]That, you know, get me going.
[126:24.32]Loot the dead birds?
[126:25.14]Ah, that's right.
[126:28.26]So killing four birds made me more famous than, like, turning into a criminal.
[126:31.48]That's interesting.
[126:41.43]How- Horse breaking jobs are now available.
[126:45.94]Okay, well, it's morning time.
[126:47.78]Let's do this one.
[126:53.01]And there's his toxic shit.
[126:54.53]Okay.
[127:04.25]Oh, what is that?
[127:04.87]Dr. McGillicuddy's?
[127:05.69]Seth of the dead.
[127:07.03]Yes.
[127:07.93]Interesting fellow.
[127:09.25]You don't meet many men these days with the moral fortitude to cut straight to the chase like that, do you?
[127:15.60]Thankfully not, Mr. Wes Dickens.
[127:18.24]Yes.
[127:18.96]The Monopoly.
[127:19.56]The society is remarkably harsh on professional exhumers.
[127:23.18]But did you know that in ancient Egypt, it was an art form valued more highly than literature?
[127:28.56]I believe Seth comes from that school of thought.
[127:31.93]Yes.
[127:32.55]You're gonna do it anyway, so just kill him now.
[127:34.35]That is true.
[127:35.03]I am merely the help, not mercifully the arbiter of wisdom.
[127:46.06]What you are, dear boy, is the man whose life I've saved twice now.
[127:52.00]A man who sells lies and deceit to unwitting people.
[127:55.10]But you've got magical shooting powers.
[127:57.76]I won't think twice about putting a bullet through his skull.
[128:00.85]Feeding the vultures myself.
[128:02.71]You see, Mr. Marston, you have the exterior of a violent man, but the soul of an angel.
[128:08.27]And that is what I think I cherish most about you.
[128:12.92]That's what I thought.
[128:15.10]But before we can attend to your particular problems, we need some extra lubricant.
[128:22.69]That's right.
[128:23.55]I gave him a little buddy shove and the mission didn't fail.
[128:26.59]This being America, that lubricant with which we concern ourselves is money.
[128:38.21]He's just a sweet old man.
[128:41.44]We need weapons.
[128:43.94]Armor plate for the wagon.
[128:46.42]Extra hands.
[128:48.86]And...
[128:51.16]That's way too heavy.
[128:53.86]Let's sell some more of these cures.
[128:56.36]Sell cures?
[128:57.88]Around here?
[128:59.00]Do you want to see me lynched?
[129:01.28]No.
[129:02.10]The sport of kings.
[129:03.98]Racing, my friend.
[129:05.12]No, no racing.
[129:05.78]I don't want to race.
[129:06.32]The sport of kings.
[129:07.60]A noble activity.
[129:08.70]God damn it.
[129:10.76]This is going to take me all day.
[129:12.10]The kind of activity a lying, cheating degenerate like myself can prosper.
[129:20.98]I don't want to race.
[129:23.76]Now, I was getting real Snoopy vibe from that, by the way.
[129:39.89]Ride shotgun accompany to gap-tooth breach.
[129:47.33]Seth is an interesting fellow, is he not?
[129:49.33]Why is there a horse running after me?
[129:53.37]I can see why you two get along.
[129:54.69]Is that my horse?
[129:56.23]He doesn't want to be left behind.
[129:59.82]That's so sad.
[130:00.72]I feel so bad.
[130:01.40]What a loyal boy.
[130:02.14]Nobody is more critical of
[130:15.81]Is he still there?
[130:16.33]He's like, daddy, wait for me.
[130:19.67]Don't run away from me so fast.
[130:21.00]I can't keep up.
[130:24.00]Let's go.
[130:32.55]He's a good boy.
[130:37.07]He's still there.
[130:37.83]He came all the way.
[130:38.67]He went like 50 miles.
[130:41.61]Are we going to race a wagon?
[130:45.62]Oh, no.
[130:46.64]Not this shit.
[130:52.45]I'm not ready for this.
[130:54.37]Wait, what?
[130:56.93]Get on a cart to start a race.
[130:58.81]Fuck me.
[130:59.31]No.
[131:04.97]I'm just warning you guys.
[131:05.67]Now this is going to take the long... I'm not going to do this first try.
[131:08.99]I'm not going to do this second try.
[131:11.23]Can I kill... Can people die?
[131:16.85]Fair race.
[131:26.88]Part of me can't wait for this, and the other part of me is so annoyed that I have to do this.
[131:32.48]See you guys in three hours.
[131:33.52]Get off the fucking road immediately!
[131:45.65]Would you like me to... Restart the game.
[131:55.87]I would have had it.
[131:57.75]I'm going straight up.
[131:58.81]I'm going straight up the middle.
[132:03.69]Get out of the way.
[132:04.29]Everybody move.
[132:05.43]This caused a fucking... This caused carnage.
[132:08.70]Okay, I'm good.
[132:10.28]Made it.
[132:13.74]Disqualified.
[132:14.30]Don't shoot anybody.
[132:15.74]You got it.
[132:16.10]You just gotta bully your way to the front.
[132:19.94]That's how you do it.
[132:20.50]I got a decent lead here.
[132:23.16]I just gotta chill.
[132:29.66]What?
[132:30.01]What?
[132:30.33]What?
[132:31.35]Oh.
[132:31.57]Okay, that was unexpected.
[132:42.26]I almost just drove through that.
[132:43.62]Ow.
[132:46.18]Ow!
[132:47.04]Now's not the time.
[132:48.80]Now's easy.
[132:49.38]Slow it down.
[132:49.94]Don't panic.
[132:51.54]Stop panicking.
[132:52.78]You'll be fine.
[133:11.92]Stay on the road.
[133:12.44]Come on.
[133:19.02]First place.
[133:19.56]These corners are, like, heinous.
[133:36.01]Which way?
[133:36.31]Which way?
[133:37.03]Which way?
[133:37.49]I don't know which way to go.
[133:39.73]Oh, here.
[133:39.97]Okay, we're good.
[133:59.88]We're good.
[134:00.76]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[134:01.76]Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.
[134:12.07]Come on, let me first try this.
[134:13.33]First real attempt.
[134:14.41]Come on.
[134:18.69]I did it.
[134:22.82]It's close.
[134:24.28]This fucking guy is right behind me.
[134:25.78]He's right up my ass.
[134:33.46]Got it.
[134:34.06]First try.
[134:35.16]Bang.
[134:40.30]Oh, I'm so glad that happened.
[134:47.77]I was gonna kill that guy, but no, I ain't gonna fuck around.
[134:51.69]Right.
[134:52.21]Best remove ourselves from the stage before somebody decides they want their money back.
[134:56.66]Yeah, just go.
[134:57.24]Skip.
[134:57.80]No fucking around.
[134:58.52]No jokes.
[134:58.98]No shooting.
[134:59.54]Don't shoot the gun head.
[135:00.80]It'll end.
[135:01.12]And I'll have to do it again.
[135:02.50]I ain't doing that again.
[135:12.18]It was too easy.
[135:14.16]No, it was hard.
[135:14.92]That was not easy.
[135:18.13]I shut up and I focused.
[135:18.81]Do that seven more times.
[135:19.71]Splendid.
[135:41.82]Shutting up does provide content, as previously proven.
[135:45.92]There he goes.
[135:47.12]Am I going to give some of my winnings to cover the hospital bills of the people I ran into?
[135:51.79]Absolutely not.
[135:52.45]Thanks for the three dollars.
[135:53.21]We've got a geek in here.
[136:13.38]Wait, is this the guy that I pushed?
[136:14.92]Is this the comedian?
[136:17.14]Wait, I didn't already do this?
[136:18.22]Did we already do this?
[136:18.88]Do we see this cutscene already?
[136:42.13]We already did this, right?
[136:46.59]I can skip this, can't I?
[136:47.74]Yeah.
[136:49.78]Funny Man Journal entry added.
[137:02.91]What's that guy doing out there?
[137:06.13]Is that guy about to kill somebody?
[137:08.15]That guy's holding a knife!
[137:08.99]Did you see that?
[137:19.58]I just stopped a murder.
[137:26.59]I can't reuse any jokes.
[137:28.87]Don't worry, I won't.
[137:32.11]Alright, we have some options here.
[137:35.40]Where do I want to go?
[137:36.08]I'm going to go to I...
[137:44.45]Do I want to go to W again?
[137:47.46]Let's go, but let's just do this.
[137:49.20]We're right here.
[137:49.66]I'm going to keep this going.
[137:53.82]We're right down the street.
[138:01.14]Swindle stone somebody?
[138:02.72]I could do that.
[138:03.20]I'm trying to...
[138:15.27]I was trying to jump over them.
[138:17.17]You don't have to abandon everything.
[138:18.43]This is not a big deal.
[138:21.75]Um... This might actually be kind of interesting.
[138:32.16]The train's coming.
[138:34.68]Sue in here.
[138:35.10]And this guy's running just right on the tracks.
[138:37.34]You think he's gonna get run over?
[138:39.94]Can I herd this guy?
[138:43.36]Alright, I'm gonna herd this guy like the herding mission.
[138:45.36]I'm just gonna herd the guy on the tracks.
[138:54.72]And eventually he's gonna get run over, right?
[139:04.19]Which way is the train going?
[139:08.35]It's coming... Is it going this way?
[139:10.51]No, it's gonna take a while.
[139:15.95]It's gonna go all the way around.
[139:17.43]This is gonna take a little while.
[139:22.80]Frames?
[139:23.34]Are we losing frames here?
[139:31.34]Come on.
[139:31.78]Go that way.
[139:35.58]This is a very calculated train joke.
[139:37.22]No, no, no, no, no.
[139:38.58]Come on.
[139:39.04]Come on.
[139:39.36]Back that way.
[139:41.86]Back that way.
[139:42.34]Go on.
[139:44.48]Where's the train?
[139:46.49]Actually, no, it is coming this way.
[139:47.53]It's coming this way.
[139:48.11]Get back on that fucking track.
[139:54.72]Come on.
[139:56.12]Right there, right there.
[139:56.84]Shit!
[140:01.01]Alright, he's going kind of the right way.
[140:06.61]Keep going that way.
[140:14.77]There we go.
[140:15.55]Just gotta get around the area.
[140:16.51]Okay, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
[140:20.38]Where's the drain?
[140:25.58]Coming.
[140:35.17]It's almost here.
[140:35.97]There's another guy now.
[140:40.01]Give me a ride.
[140:43.74]Hey!
[140:44.70]Hey!
[140:45.74]What?
[140:47.20]Are you?
[140:48.56]Give me the gun.
[140:49.06]Give me.
[140:49.56]What?
[140:52.45]What the fuck?
[140:54.13]Are you kidding me right now?
[140:56.09]You blew it.
[140:56.61]That guy blew everything.
[140:57.99]Go that way.
[140:58.55]You go that way now.
[140:59.43]This way.
[141:01.25]I'll hurt you with a gun instead.
[141:10.78]Come on.
[141:11.78]No, no.
[141:12.58]Go that way.
[141:19.56]Over here.
[141:20.96]Where's the fucking train?
[141:27.24]Here it comes.
[141:27.58]Here it comes.
[141:31.42]Come on.
[141:31.88]Just run on the tracks like that.
[141:33.58]Perfect.
[141:35.24]I don't want to go too far.
[141:35.96]Alright, where is it?
[141:41.15]Which way is it gonna go?
[141:41.79]I don't know which way the train's gonna go.
[141:42.89]I gotta turn him around.
[141:47.45]No.
[141:50.30]It's coming that way.
[141:50.82]It's that way.
[141:51.56]There it comes.
[141:52.10]There it comes.
[141:54.18]Oh, shit.
[141:54.68]No.
[141:55.94]No, go this way.
[141:56.52]Go this way.
[141:56.84]Go this way.
[141:57.16]Go this way.
[141:57.76]Go this way.
[141:59.80]Oh, my...
[142:06.56]Stupid fucking guy that like stole my horse blew it all.
[142:09.06]I didn't know which way the train was even fucking coming.
[142:22.07]Where's my horse?
[142:32.54]And all that happened was somebody stole my horse.
[142:36.15]And I got it back.
[142:37.25]God fucking damn it.
[142:41.31]I'm so angry.
[142:48.63]I'm, like, inconsolable right now.
[142:53.77]Just going to W. Go, go, go.
[143:00.74]This is gonna be bad.
[143:02.08]This is gonna be bad.
[143:03.26]No, it's not.
[143:27.42]We're good.
[143:27.86]Go.
[143:32.74]You just gotta surf it.
[143:33.78]I know.
[143:34.30]We've proven that.
[143:41.76]No, no jumping.
[143:42.44]You gotta ride the wave, man.
[143:47.53]What's this?
[143:49.73]Property?
[143:52.55]How much is it?
[143:56.54]It is $5 to rent.
[144:01.46]Do I want this?
[144:05.66]Frames are good.
[144:06.18]Are we back with decent frames?
[144:07.66]What happened?
[144:12.82]I'm going to do this quest.
[144:19.29]I thought it was just going to automatically fucking undo it.
[144:21.41]I thought that was like...
[144:24.03]What if my contact's not available right now?
[144:26.49]I was hoping that we were just gonna do the thing where it's just, hey, you're in the thing, now it's over, we can go to the cutscene.
[144:36.13]But where is he?
[144:36.83]Rip him out of his fucking little, like, Shake Shack!
[144:41.45]Hello?
[144:41.81]Oh, you're not available right now, huh?
[144:52.54]That's great.
[144:57.85]Come here.
[144:58.75]We're going to move away from the area for a minute.
[145:04.69]Now let's turn around.
[145:05.49]Hopefully we get the marker back.
[145:14.40]Oh, come on.
[145:17.26]What have I done?
[145:17.74]I thought I did something bad to the horse.
[145:29.14]Should I just go sleep in the tent?
[145:34.52]No, I'm going to rent the tent.
[145:35.42]Where was it?
[145:35.84]I don't even remember where the hell it was.
[145:39.03]Over here?
[145:44.23]I'm so completely absent-minded with that.
[145:46.07]I have no idea.
[145:46.57]It was back this way, wasn't it?
[145:53.07]Sleep in somebody's tent.
[145:54.69]Let's go.
[145:58.57]You can't jump over a table, you pathetic motherfucker.
[146:01.09]Okay.
[146:02.05]Go to bed.
[146:08.64]Save game.
[146:09.72]Change outfits, too.
[146:12.64]Let me do my aerobics first.
[146:24.61]That's been a long time since I've done a manual save.
[146:29.10]Let's change our clothes.
[146:31.68]What?
[146:32.26]Oh, come on.
[146:37.12]Can I jump over a table?
[146:38.10]Yes.
[146:38.32]I don't think I can, actually.
[146:43.25]Sorry.
[146:45.77]Got it.
[146:47.07]That was over.
[146:47.51]That was close enough.
[146:48.33]Close enough.
[146:52.75]Let's go back to William.
[146:59.96]Is he not here?
[147:03.32]Why is he not here?
[147:04.58]What the fuck?
[147:07.26]Ugh.
[147:10.80]Why are you... Well, we're going to Seth.
[147:27.89]Five dollars wasted.
[147:33.07]Or are we going to go to I?
[147:34.27]Actually, let's go to I. Where's I?
[147:36.19]Is there an armadillo?
[147:44.16]Armadillo!
[147:49.82]Thank you, the scarediest cat.
[147:51.95]That was a disaster.
[147:53.03]I love you.
[147:54.93]Well, thanks.
[147:55.99]Thank you for the bits.
[147:57.67]Thank you also to Keisha and WDX for the bits as well.
[148:06.17]Finally made chat happy.
[148:12.09]I try.
[148:13.19]I try.
[148:16.59]Go, girl.
[148:19.63]Howdy.
[148:30.48]Got enough, mister?
[148:32.08]How about a game?
[148:35.04]Come on.
[148:35.84]Come on.
[149:04.40]What?
[149:09.68]God damn it.
[149:10.38]I don't... Fuck.
[149:11.52]I'm going to scream at this.
[149:12.54]I just pressed Y because Y... I'm never doing this again.
[149:37.25]Okay, X is... Let me explain.
[149:40.47]X on Xbox is Y to me because of Super fucking Nintendo.
[149:46.14]Those of you guys that played a dickload of Super Nintendo, right?
[149:49.48]X is where Y is.
[149:50.68]Y is where X is.
[149:52.20]B is where A is.
[149:54.16]That's why I can't ever memorize the Xbox controller.
[149:56.77]Ever.
[149:59.79]To make this the Super Nintendo controller, you gotta fucking turn the controller.
[150:06.16]Fuck the piece of shit Xbox controller.
[150:08.18]It sucks, by the way.
[150:12.66]I know what triangle, square, X, and circle are.
[150:17.63]And where the Super Nintendo buttons are.
[150:20.39]Get a shitty console.
[150:21.57]Burn this fucking thing.
[150:26.02]Alright, um... What are we doing?
[150:33.09]I tried to give it one more attempt, but I'm never going to be able to memorize these buttons.
[150:36.59]My muscle memory is just wrong.
[150:37.69]What the fuck is this guy's problem?
[150:38.68]I don't know how to do a duel.
[150:40.92]How do you duel?
[150:42.14]I've never done this.
[151:04.94]Oh, I hear the tutorial, cool.
[151:10.78]Just remember the colors, it's never gonna happen.
[151:23.24]Turn him in the head like- Oh my god!
[151:30.90]Alright, well... I won.
[151:40.46]Streamer struggles to play Simon Says.
[151:43.78]No, guys, even like the colors are wrong, right?
[151:46.88]Because 99% of all my console gaming is on PlayStation, right?
[151:51.48]Like, blue.
[151:52.92]Let's look at it.
[151:54.52]The colors are different.
[151:56.40]Red is not where red is.
[151:59.72]There ain't no fucking green.
[152:01.00]Well, green is triangle.
[152:02.14]Triangle is like, why?
[152:03.54]I can't go by colors.
[152:05.10]It's not gonna work.
[152:12.19]What is this?
[152:12.85]Where do I want to go?
[152:19.92]Hi.
[152:26.68]Turn on the face cam to evaluate.
[152:30.68]I don't look at colors.
[152:31.49]You know, I don't look at colors either.
[152:32.79]I just go by what it is.
[152:36.14]Green is A on Xbox.
[152:37.56]Green is triangle.
[152:38.38]Triangle is where Y is on the Xbox.
[152:40.16]Can't do it by color.
[152:41.78]Turn the controller upside down.
[152:43.90]Yeah.
[153:02.09]When a man with a sing-song voice tells me to fuck off, it always concerns me, boyo.
[153:08.41]Look here.
[153:09.09]This paddy bastard stole our guns.
[153:11.21]Tried to steal our horses.
[153:12.81]Law's clear on the matter.
[153:13.93]I never stole nothing, sir.
[153:15.58]Never did nothing on me life.
[153:16.90]That French cunt is playing with the Welshman's tiny and ineffective mind.
[153:21.80]Anyway, y'all got horses now.
[153:25.34]No one needs to die.
[153:27.22]Leave him be.
[153:27.72]I don't like this outfit.
[153:28.44]I gotta change this.
[153:29.04]What do you think you are, boyo?
[153:30.22]The bloody cavalry?
[153:33.00]And you both been disarmed.
[153:34.00]And that's how you fucking take care of business.
[153:53.84]Mr. Nigel West Dickens said you'd help me locate a machine gun.
[153:57.14]No, I guess they did die.
[153:58.70]Since I just saved your life.
[154:00.28]I can't thank you enough for taking care of those two degenerates.
[154:04.42]Untrustworthy.
[154:05.80]Poor in personal hygiene.
[154:07.70]Lacking in the finer qualities of a gentleman.
[154:11.70]Disarmed of their lives.
[154:12.80]What about the gun?
[154:14.04]It'd be my pleasure.
[154:15.91]She's magnificent.
[154:16.75]Disarmed of life.
[154:18.63]It'll be a bit of a ride, but we'll get there soon enough.
[154:22.93]Follow me, fella.
[154:31.20]All righty, me guardian angel.
[154:32.42]This way.
[154:34.63]Alright, come on, then.
[154:35.57]Let's find this wood.
[154:41.60]Just think alphabetical order.
[154:42.70]A, B, closest to your thumbs, X, Y. It doesn't matter.
[154:46.22]I have like 12,000 hours on Super Nintendo.
[154:50.11]It was my entire life when I was younger.
[154:51.65]There's no way I'll ever be able to think of it any other way.
[154:54.68]I literally probably have like maybe like 20,000 hours on Super Nintendo.
[155:00.40]Like at least like four years sitting at the computer.
[155:03.32]Made up at the screen.
[155:06.18]Is it normal for friends in Europe to drown each other?
[155:09.86]Never trust a Welshman, me pa always told me.
[155:12.77]And he got his throat slit.
[155:14.71]A thousand days.
[155:15.49]The kind of fellows who will steal an acorn from a blind sow and then kick her for squealing.
[155:20.27]And as for that French bastard.
[155:21.81]He didn't sound very French.
[155:23.87]I like this guy's voice.
[155:25.21]Best Super Nintendo game?
[155:26.19]Oh, it's easy.
[155:26.51]Chrono Trigger.
[155:26.97]Mario RPG.
[155:27.17]Super Mario World.
[155:27.98]Turtles in Time.
[155:28.46]I could go on.
[155:28.84]Irish, I've met enough men like you to last me a lifetime.
[155:52.43]Wowee.
[155:53.05]Meet at the cliff.
[155:53.61]I thought we were just both going over.
[155:59.49]I was about to say, what the fuck?
[156:00.39]Hard mode, bro.
[156:00.97]Turtles in time.
[156:01.79]Search the cabin for the gun.
[156:03.41]Okay, well, we're going to take a little different, a small different approach here.
[156:22.66]I'm gonna go with, like, the element of surprise.
[156:24.12]And they're, like, never gonna see it coming.
[156:30.46]Gonna jump down.
[156:34.14]We're gonna do fucking Deadeye.
[156:35.38]It's gonna be like a Spider-Man movie.
[156:39.72]I'm gonna get it.
[156:40.60]I can get it.
[156:53.52]I'm gonna get it.
[156:57.68]This is gonna be worth it.
[156:58.64]Well, you guys don't think it's gonna be worth it.
[156:59.89]It will be, don't worry.
[157:00.73]I'm gonna jump down, Deadeye.
[157:01.89]Can I Deadeye?
[157:02.87]This is gonna be like when you jump down as Reaper and you fucking die, die, die.
[157:06.19]Or like McCree.
[157:06.95]I'm making Overwatch references.
[157:08.26]Don't tell me why I'm doing that.
[157:22.46]Hold on.
[157:24.40]That was too high.
[157:26.20]It was a little too high.
[157:27.80]Wait, wait, wait.
[157:28.86]It'll be worth it.
[157:29.50]Just like fucking Spider-Man in Venom.
[157:36.60]Okay, here we go.
[157:37.32]Oh.
[157:39.96]They didn't even fucking see it coming.
[157:56.93]Get off the fucking horse.
[157:57.97]It's over.
[158:08.49]He's walking around.
[158:15.38]Double tap.
[158:18.12]Alright, we're good.
[158:19.52]Get inside there.
[158:20.04]Search the cavern.
[158:23.69]Just like how fucking Peter Parker does it.
[158:26.91]He wasn't even talking about me.
[158:36.28]He wasn't even talking about me.
[158:37.12]He saw he was angry with me and then he fucking... Something over there was real important.
[158:42.90]He saw like the fucking Loch Ness Monster in here.
[158:47.14]Do you know what I mean?
[158:50.07]Something in there was way more important than me.
[158:57.71]There had to have been a fucking T-Rex inside of there for him to not care about me.
[159:01.51]The Irish guy lied to me?
[159:13.22]Damn.
[159:13.48]Well, that's too bad.
[159:26.87]Let's do some looting.
[159:32.40]And look what it cost.
[159:33.98]I want to get at least like $250.
[159:34.76]Any more?
[159:35.22]Got a guy over here.
[159:48.07]Let's skin the guy.
[159:59.18]Alright, let's, uh, I want to save it here and put the fire down.
[160:04.46]Chewing tobacco, huh?
[160:06.56]Save it.
[160:08.34]I'm curious about something.
[160:13.40]He just walked into the soups.
[160:14.44]It wasn't underneath anything.
[160:15.64]Yeah, pretty much.
[160:24.58]What?
[160:34.65]Apparently not.
[160:41.27]Change out of this stupid outfit.
[160:44.76]Well, I want to see something.
[160:47.34]Something in this water.
[160:49.32]You guys don't have to believe me if you don't want to, but like there's something in the water.
[160:52.54]We're going for a dive.
[160:59.11]Almost made it in the water.
[160:59.97]We almost made it in.
[161:00.95]We made it in the water.
[161:01.73]Good.
[161:06.07]What?
[161:12.56]Wait.
[161:13.00]Wait a minute.
[161:13.58]Wait a minute.
[161:14.24]You... You can't... There's no swimming in Red Dead Redemption.
[161:19.04]You just die if your head goes underwater.
[161:30.96]I don't believe that for a second.
[161:32.08]That's fucking stupid.
[161:33.26]Wait.
[161:37.29]So we go from taking a drink in the water to instantly dead.
[161:41.41]What's the threshold?
[161:48.44]Okay, we're still fine.
[161:49.38]We're good.
[161:50.22]We're taking a drink.
[161:58.86]The horse is okay.
[162:02.29]No!
[162:10.48]Well, your horse's head went underwater.
[162:12.40]You die.
[162:13.96]Whatever, let's go.
[162:21.85]That's funny.
[162:24.43]What a strange game.
[162:28.17]Where's the realism?
[162:34.72]Play this game with me, buddy?
[162:37.94]Wanna play a race game with me?
[162:39.14]You don't wanna race me?
[162:43.30]I need to go back to I. How far away are we from I?
[162:56.17]Pretty far away.
[162:56.81]I'm just gonna... Let's just get off.
[163:02.14]Breaking news.
[163:02.70]Streamer does not have lungs.
[163:10.98]You can't swim with a gentleman outfit on.
[163:12.76]Where the hell was he again?
[163:17.50]He's in up here.
[163:20.08]Benedict Point.
[163:21.56]Solomon's Folly.
[163:22.92]Plain View.
[163:23.56]A shower would literally kill John Marston.
[163:32.06]It would.
[163:37.84]Change your good boy?
[163:38.80]Is this, is this, am I, wait, am I wearing the good boy outfit?
[163:41.12]Is that what it is?
[163:45.80]Alright, so I gotta, like, break in here, smash the door open, and just, you know, kill the guy or something, right?
[163:52.22]I'm sure he'll probably try to convince me not to.
[163:55.56]Let's see what happens.
[164:02.46]Oh, no.
[164:02.90]Oh, wait a minute.
[164:03.46]Oh, God.
[164:03.68]Okay.
[164:08.00]Oh wait, no, no, no.
[164:11.64]I thought that was a naked lady.
[164:13.00]No, no naked lady.
[164:13.48]Better hurry.
[164:13.78]Found us one Irish.
[164:14.54]We're in this together.
[164:15.30]You, me, and an assault on Fort Mercer.
[164:38.55]I'm the guy that saved you from getting killed back there.
[164:40.87]And who you owe your life to, remember?
[164:43.17]Not really.
[164:44.29]Happens to me all the time.
[164:45.51]You don't want it to happen to you again, do you, Irish?
[164:49.75]Does this guy have a name?
[164:51.11]Why are they only calling people by their, like, nationalities?
[164:54.05]I wants to tell you how much she means to me.
[164:56.57]How special she is.
[164:58.23]And I want to tell you that if you don't produce a Gatling gun within the hour, you'll wish you'd been killed back there.
[165:04.97]It's the whiskey, sir.
[165:09.93]It gives me the memory of a newborn babe, as innocent as can be.
[165:15.73]A couple of fucking crazy zany characters here.
[165:19.61]And it makes me violently angry.
[165:21.37]Seth is my.
[165:21.65]Seth is my favorite nationality.
[165:23.53]Shall we go look for that gun, sir?
[165:26.39]Yes.
[165:28.09]Let's do that.
[165:30.01]Yeah, well, first it was like Irish, Welsh, French.
[165:32.69]Not a feller to give up easily, are ye?
[165:37.34]Alright.
[165:37.88]Mount your horse.
[165:40.00]This is mine.
[165:40.76]You get on yours.
[165:48.82]Can I go get another haircut?
[165:53.72]Maybe I should get a haircut.
[165:57.21]Itchy arm.
[165:57.67]Hold on.
[166:05.48]I love how this is just Scrooge McDuck.
[166:07.30]Haircut IRL stream?
[166:09.89]No.
[166:10.01]Fucking haircut.
[166:24.11]Toime.
[166:24.97]I like that.
[166:25.65]I like- I like toime.
[166:26.55]When you- I is like O-I.
[166:42.92]Where's the gun, Irish?
[166:44.44]I hear some miners been blabbing about a machine gun they found.
[166:47.62]Apparently, they got it stashed up at Gaptooth Bre.
[166:50.84]What do miners want with a machine gun?
[166:53.09]Shoot it at somebody, I suppose.
[166:55.15]Or sell it.
[166:55.89]I don't know.
[166:56.37]I've never been down a mine in all me life.
[166:58.55]Sounds real fishy to me, Irish.
[167:00.53]I've just about had it with you and your games.
[167:03.15]You and Wes Dickens are so crooked, you can swallow nails and spit out corkscrews.
[167:08.31]That's a good line.
[167:09.15]I really like that line a lot.
[167:10.71]I'm going to use that.
[167:11.63]Someone's going to double-cross me and I'm going to say that.
[167:14.49]And they're going to be fucking shocked.
[167:15.97]They're going to be like, wow.
[167:17.25]I'm sorry, dude.
[167:40.60]Everybody's such a dick in this game.
[167:42.08]Especially to you.
[167:43.28]Stop, dammit.
[167:43.76]Don't go so far.
[167:44.48]I told you once, I told you twice.
[167:56.24]We should probably move.
[167:56.98]There's people coming right now.
[167:58.08]They are coming over here.
[167:59.46]I can't get out of this cutscene.
[168:00.57]What are we doing here?
[168:23.99]Is this supposed to be part of the game?
[168:26.82]You can use Deadeye to take out multiple targets quickly and then sweep the cross over these two guards.
[168:33.95]Yep!
[168:50.40]And your friend too!
[168:51.74]And your friend too!
[168:52.66]Hey!
[168:53.06]Whoa!
[169:01.80]Fuck your horse, by the way.
[169:06.64]I did that for fun!
[169:07.50]I thought that'd be fun.
[169:19.17]Calculate.
[169:21.44]Alright, find a way into the mines.
[169:22.76]I'm gonna assume I gotta go this way.
[169:25.20]Actually, maybe not.
[169:25.66]Let me sneak the other way.
[169:31.10]Duck Dynasty Episode 2.
[169:32.40]I could say that.
[169:40.32]Well, at least I'm making some slight money.
[169:45.91]Was I spotted?
[169:47.65]I don't know how.
[170:06.15]Well, okay, let's... speaking of Deadeye... Reload!
[170:26.62]Are you guys still alive?
[170:31.50]How on Earth are you still alive?
[170:41.23]Show yourself.
[170:43.63]Head.
[170:44.69]Oh, come on.
[170:48.18]Ha ha ha.
[170:57.22]My suit is fucked up.
[170:58.26]Yeah, it really is.
[170:59.54]It's not good.
[171:02.87]Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot.
[171:14.13]I shot his hat off.
[171:14.87]What a funny streamer.
[171:16.15]I'm sorry.
[171:16.58]I wasn't trying to be a funny streamer.
[171:20.78]Trying to play at least one mission semi-serious, right?
[171:26.98]Into the mines.
[171:27.56]And there are people here.
[171:33.76]He's down.
[171:42.71]I want a new rifle.
[171:43.47]I feel like there are better rifles.
[171:44.85]Is that TNT?
[171:46.31]I think that is TNT.
[171:48.69]Yeah.
[171:53.86]Easy game.
[172:01.37]Loot.
[172:02.57]Go, go, go.
[172:04.87]Chest or anything, probably?
[172:05.65]Something weird?
[172:07.48]No?
[172:10.54]There's TNT on this side, too.
[172:12.02]I don't want to get myself killed.
[172:19.61]It's very much an accidental TNT.
[172:22.03]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.
[172:34.88]Easy.
[172:35.50]I can actually loot you though, come here.
[172:44.87]Making lots of money.
[172:46.45]That makes me happy.
[172:51.09]You know what makes me happy?
[172:54.45]Sweeping across and just shooting somebody for free.
[173:07.46]Dead?
[173:08.64]Hey, that guy's... Red Dead.
[173:14.87]Oh shit, it's like a zombie from Resident Evil.
[173:17.15]They're on the ground, he's gonna bite me in the leg.
[173:20.48]Will he actually do that?
[173:22.32]Or is he just, like, dying?
[173:36.47]Just die, you know?
[173:39.09]Come here.
[173:41.35]He turned into a worm.
[173:42.49]200 bucks?
[173:50.68]Am I going the wrong way?
[173:52.66]No.
[173:57.75]I don't even need to hide.
[173:58.59]What's the point?
[174:03.61]TNT!
[174:05.53]TNT!
[174:07.43]Shoot the TNT!
[174:09.27]Cool.
[174:10.43]Good TNT shot.
[174:14.63]I actually got it.
[174:15.49]Nice work.
[174:25.08]When did I turn into Elvis?
[174:28.01]An hour ago, maybe?
[174:30.35]Maybe, give or take.
[174:37.09]That's fucking Macho Man Randy Savage with a gun.
[174:46.90]Through... I threaded the needle there.
[174:49.58]That's at least like one or two PogChamps.
[174:53.04]It's not like it automatically aimed.
[174:56.81]Come on.
[174:57.05]Give me that credit for that one.
[175:04.44]One more bunch of guys.
[175:11.96]TNT?
[175:12.30]Let's go for a TNT kill.
[175:20.29]It's gotta count for something.
[175:27.77]Oh my god, please tell me.
[175:30.41]Is this going to turn into a Donkey Kong level?
[175:34.13]Tell me now.
[175:34.79]Don't let me get my hopes up.
[175:36.14]Is this Donkey Kong?
[175:38.24]Do I get in the cart?
[175:40.16]I hope that's what it is.
[175:46.10]Oh no, it's not Donkey Kong.
[175:50.24]Damn it.
[175:55.97]Grab onto the mine cart.
[175:58.89]Why shoot the lanterns?
[176:00.09]Why?
[176:01.79]Oh, because they make fire.
[176:05.33]Push the minecart to the shaft room.
[176:11.77]Oh, come on.
[176:14.47]This is not like the Donkey Kong level.
[176:16.23]I have to actually move the cart with my hands.
[176:25.64]Only sidearms can be used.
[176:27.00]Well, I need to reload this then.
[176:34.40]Wait, when I gain enough speed, I'm gonna jump on it?
[176:41.52]It's Donkey Kong on hard.
[176:45.90]Alright, I'm on it now.
[176:47.14]Now I am just riding it.
[176:48.16]I guess I'm just gonna burst through, right?
[176:53.43]That was so... That was lame.
[176:59.29]It was.
[177:04.86]There's no reason for that.
[177:09.99]Wow, what a level.
[177:20.83]That was intense.
[177:26.50]Why would it have told me to pull my sidearm out if there was no people there to shoot?
[177:33.56]Do I actually get to ride the rollercoaster?
[177:37.42]Oh my god, yes.
[177:38.46]I get to ride the rollercoaster.
[177:39.94]This is exactly what we wanted.
[177:41.48]This is what we wanted.
[178:04.53]Alright, get on it.
[178:05.19]Come on.
[178:06.69]Just like six flags.
[178:07.73]Uh-oh, this fucking bridge is going to like, I'm going to blow up the fucking bridge.
[178:13.95]I just wanted to see.
[178:28.14]Don't let go of her.
[178:29.30]She's a beast.
[178:33.35]I just wanted to see, I wanted to see.
[178:34.73]Don't worry, there's plenty more jokes we can make about this.
[178:43.71]This has got so much more fun.
[178:44.89]Come on, let's go really fast.
[178:49.30]Really fast.
[178:49.92]Oh, yeah!
[178:51.28]Fuck you, yeah?
[178:57.44]We are actually going fast, good.
[178:59.24]More speed.
[179:03.40]No!
[179:04.86]What?
[179:05.10]It's already over!
[179:05.90]What the fuck?
[179:06.60]That would have been so much fun!
[179:07.86]That was so- That was not even fun!
[179:12.22]They had such an opportunity for a funny, like, rollercoaster ride.
[179:15.82]This guy's gonna steal this, right?
[179:34.79]I would steal if I were him.
[179:36.95]If I was the Irish guy.
[179:41.52]He's a liar.
[179:43.00]Watch out for the Irish guy.
[179:44.24]He's a liar.
[179:44.88]He's a swindler.
[179:46.68]He's going to steal your stuff.
[179:49.08]And he's going to get drunk and then yell and scream at you.
[179:51.42]There's a snake.
[180:07.53]Uh, do I do Irish again?
[180:08.83]What was that?
[180:18.00]What the hell was that noise?
[180:18.82]That was, like, such a weird animal.
[180:28.15]Fascinating.
[180:33.13]Wow.
[180:33.83]Nature's so interesting.
[180:35.47]What a fascinating animal.
[180:39.76]Oh, we got a Geek.
[180:53.54]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[181:00.18]I need to do this.
[181:00.89]It's important.
[181:12.23]He reacted the first time.
[181:13.47]What does he want now?
[181:16.19]Is this the guy that I tied up before?
[181:18.87]There's so many random people in this game.
[181:21.41]It's going...
[181:39.94]California?
[181:40.48]Isn't there a drought in California?
[181:43.48]Not anymore.
[181:44.20]I guess back in the 1990s when this game came out.
[182:08.13]Ocean is wet.
[182:08.43]What's this guy's deal?
[182:09.33]He just... Okay.
[182:38.00]California Journal entry, yeah.
[182:39.54]Alright, don't worry about him.
[182:45.18]He's gonna be fine.
[182:45.76]I just kinda get mauled by a possum.
[182:53.04]I would laugh.
[182:55.21]Alright, can we do W now?
[182:59.63]How far away are we?
[183:03.59]We are... Seth is right there.
[183:08.41]Let's see what Steph has for us.
[183:18.40]After this mission, I'm going to take a break.
[183:19.78]I'm going to take a pee, grab a drink, and make a snack.
[183:25.61]And we'll continue.
[183:30.22]I love the random interactions.
[183:31.86]I'm glad that they brought them to GTA 5.
[183:33.24]Because they're some of my favorite things.
[183:36.20]Just random people like screaming and like... Random encounters everywhere.
[183:40.52]It's great.
[183:41.08]I love it.
[183:44.32]Rockstar really just knows how to make a video game.
[183:47.69]Seem like there's stuff going on.
[183:50.99]All too often when you get like these open world games... The side missions and the side quests are...
[183:58.29]Kill ten guys.
[184:00.67]Drive.
[184:01.21]Drop this off.
[184:03.01]There's no real interaction.
[184:07.39]Rockstar does a really good job with actually making you feel like the things that you're doing and the worlds that you're in actually exist.
[184:16.48]Come on.
[184:18.00]Come on.
[184:19.92]Come on.
[184:20.30]Come on.
[184:20.68]Come on.
[184:21.04]Come on.
[184:21.36]Come on.
[184:23.62]Nice jump.
[184:25.52]Is it too late to get over here now?
[184:27.10]It is, isn't it?
[184:29.67]Why is this blocked out?
[184:32.68]Is it too late?
[184:33.76]Too early?
[184:34.22]Okay, that was weird.
[184:41.46]I don't think this is real.
[184:43.08]Hey, Seth!
[184:54.06]Seth, come back here.
[184:55.00]This guy's gross.
[184:55.66]Hey, partner.
[184:56.42]I was just looking for you.
[184:57.80]Looking for me?
[184:58.52]What?
[184:59.36]Over there?
[184:59.86]How you doing?
[185:00.36]That was my waypoint.
[185:03.16]Well, see you later, partner.
[185:04.74]I thought it was blocked out.
[185:06.04]Like, you can't do this mission right now because it's too late.
[185:09.28]Nowhere wouldn't happen to be where that thing you're looking for is kept, would it?
[185:13.42]No, sir.
[185:14.85]Oh, what a fucking idiot.
[185:16.45]Okay, I was just fooling.
[185:19.29]Partner, you know, the thought of that treasure does funny things to me.
[185:25.85]According to the map, it's somewhere in that big abandoned house.
[185:28.93]Are we going to lose, Seth?
[185:29.87]I feel like we are.
[185:31.34]Go to the mansion.
[185:41.68]Does it matter if he stays behind?
[185:43.15]Well, okay.
[185:45.07]It's apparently an ambush.
[185:47.33]Did you see these fellas?
[185:49.65]Nubious as they look, I figure they must be with
[185:55.42]Well, I didn't actually... Okay, that guy's disappearing.
[185:58.49]This is freaking me out a little.
[186:00.93]Oh, pay dirt.
[186:01.51]Let's pull up the revolver.
[186:02.69]And three, two, one, action!
[186:25.70]There's only one guy.
[186:27.26]We'll just kill this guy really badly.
[186:28.94]That's completely fine.
[186:32.52]Give me the shotgun.
[186:44.54]How did he die?
[186:45.96]I didn't shoot that guy.
[187:04.10]Now this will be a good place for Deadeye, right?
[187:05.94]I would assume.
[187:08.08]Might be too far away.
[187:15.63]In the abandoned house!
[187:21.47]Are you shooting from in there?
[187:23.83]Did I get him?
[187:27.61]Got him.
[187:29.51]Got him!
[187:30.57]He's dead!
[187:40.33]Oh, see ya.
[187:41.83]Wow.
[187:42.33]Back of the head, too.
[187:43.23]That was a stealth kill.
[187:44.29]That was a fucking sneak attack.
[187:49.01]That was a fucking perfect sneak attack.
[187:50.53]Plus 100 stealth.
[188:11.40]Can't get in the front door, right?
[188:12.36]Time for some parkour.
[188:20.91]Into the bulkhead?
[188:21.57]Is that where we're going?
[188:24.53]Yep.
[188:24.81]Find the treasure.
[188:25.87]You probably should pay attention, dude.
[188:39.97]Where's ringing around the Rosie right now?
[188:41.61]What's going on?
[188:42.89]God, I'm so angry.
[188:44.91]This is going to be one hell of a massacre.
[188:46.82]OK.
[188:48.56]Sneaky sons of bitches.
[188:51.58]Might as well give up now.
[188:55.70]Sort of like T.J.
[188:56.78]Miller.
[188:57.62]Don't let him get my treasure, mister.
[189:02.77]I'm running blue.
[189:05.37]Too slow, you little sneak.
[189:07.13]Come here.
[189:10.78]Double barrel at this dude.
[189:11.88]Yeah.
[189:16.82]Up the stairs.
[189:17.76]I'm stuck on this guy's body.
[189:20.22]Couldn't even move.
[189:23.32]And here is the treasure.
[189:25.61]What's in it?
[189:28.01]Whoa.
[189:28.23]What else?
[189:39.82]That guy wasn't even on the map.
[189:42.88]His body was the treasure.
[189:47.26]So, do I get rid of Seth here and get the treasure and kill this guy?
[189:51.46]Finally, I see the light at the end of this very long, long tunnel.
[189:58.16]Seth's gonna be rich after all these years.
[190:02.65]It's silk sheets and Parisian ores from now on, mister.
[190:09.12]It's gonna be nothing inside, right?
[190:14.80]Or it's whatever.
[190:15.62]It's gonna be like a book.
[190:16.42]It's gonna be like the encyclopedia.
[190:18.03]Smash it, there's diamonds in there.
[190:22.77]There's fucking diamonds inside the eye, you stupid...
[190:35.10]This guy creeps me out.
[190:37.10]It's just a stack of highly condensed, compressed, squished-in diamonds.
[191:09.59]Just only like 25 people had to die in here.
[191:15.81]Alright.
[191:16.83]Can I pick it up?
[191:23.39]150 fame.
[191:24.11]So there's no reason.
[191:27.50]Fame?
[191:28.00]Buckaroo.
[191:28.84]I'm now a buckaroo, guys.
[191:33.41]That wonderful title.
[191:34.33]Can I jump out a fucking window?
[191:41.86]Are people here?
[191:54.05]There is a guy here.
[191:56.59]Alright, where are we going next?
[192:00.36]I can do this.
[192:02.06]This is the funny man.
[192:03.14]We're all the way down here.
[192:03.94]Let's go to funny man.
[192:11.04]Let's continue his little line.
[192:14.14]Whatever this is, I gotta pee.
[192:15.56]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[192:21.22]I'm gonna come back.
[192:22.18]Change my outfit?
[192:22.84]I will.
[192:23.65]After we do funny man.
[192:29.45]Let's just have a couple of laughs.
[192:34.95]Don't forget to drink.
[192:37.35]I'm hungry too.
[192:47.08]I'm gonna eat like a handful of potato chips when I go upstairs.
[192:50.42]That's a lot of signs.
[193:02.71]Is that like a crazy stallion or something?
[193:04.44]Look at that.
[193:04.80]Look at the hair on that thing.
[193:06.60]Look at that hair.
[193:08.84]Holy shit, I want like the Gene Simmons horse.
[193:12.18]Yeah, I'm getting the fucking Gene Simmons horse.
[193:19.66]Come here.
[193:19.88]Come here.
[193:32.64]Get over here.
[193:34.82]Yep, this is like a fucking... This is like an insane horse.
[193:37.61]This is gonna be like... Yep, look at this thing.
[193:41.15]This thing's gonna be like 25% faster.
[193:50.15]Alright, we went from a Gene Simmons horse to a Richard Simmons horse.
[193:57.56]It's alright.
[193:58.42]That's good.
[194:00.18]I know he can dance.
[194:13.51]Get him!
[194:17.75]Got him.
[194:18.97]Perfect.
[194:20.37]Okay.
[194:21.01]Let's see how fast this horse is.
[194:25.27]New items are available to purchase.
[194:26.84]Okay, let's see if it was worth it.
[194:32.44]Pretty quick.
[194:34.68]Has a lot more stamina, I think, too.
[194:42.98]I like it.
[194:49.76]Yeah, we're going, I think we're going faster.
[194:51.50]It might just be a, it might be like a sugar pill.
[194:54.56]You know, this could be like a placebo effect, but I don't even care.
[195:03.99]Don't even have a saddle yet.
[195:07.15]Okay, what are we looking for here?
[195:10.11]Why, why did the funny man want us to come this way?
[195:15.50]That was a coyote or something.
[195:21.27]There we go, okay.
[195:27.19]Wait, wait, what?
[195:28.55]Wait, I'm... What the... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[195:50.25]staircase I thought I didn't know is that far I didn't think it was a fucking like 500 foot drop what team composition did I use in Chrono Trigger where are we I got some free shit out of it
[196:14.61]Oh, we're so far away.
[196:15.66]Okay, alright.
[196:18.18]Well, whatever.
[196:19.06]We're gonna do something else.
[196:20.38]My team comp was Frog, Chrono, and Robo.
[196:29.41]If you needed to know.
[196:29.95]And if you don't want spoilers, then it was fucking purple hair guy.
[196:36.51]Frog.
[196:37.75]Chrono.
[196:38.80]Okay, you know, I don't do, like, spoilers here.
[196:47.32]Well, there's no... Alright, let me take my little break.
[196:50.27]I'll be back.
[196:50.63]I'm going to go pee.
[196:51.75]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[200:13.00]Alright, let's go back.
[200:18.24]No BRB music?
[200:20.30]No, we contemplate and we think about our lives during a BRB backstage.
[200:26.49]We sit in solidarity and think.
[200:36.09]That's what we do.
[200:42.47]Okay.
[200:43.87]Let's go.
[200:48.01]I'm eating too.
[200:49.03]By the way, I'm eating.
[200:49.83]If you don't like that, I'm sorry.
[200:53.13]I'm going to try to be as quiet as I can.
[200:55.05]And I'm swallowing and it's getting stuck.
[200:58.36]I'm very sorry.
[200:59.02]I'm going to try to be quiet about it.
[201:01.32]Let's go.
[201:05.16]Where the hell am I?
[201:14.08]Should I go up here?
[201:14.50]What am I eating?
[201:14.92]I'm eating chicken salad.
[201:18.66]I mean... Oh, okay.
[201:20.69]We can do this again.
[201:22.17]No buddy shove to this guy.
[201:24.23]We can go right up here.
[201:24.91]I'm not going to fuck around.
[201:28.54]We're going to complete this.
[201:29.28]We're going to keep going.
[201:42.40]I need this as fast as I can.
[201:43.78]This is bad.
[201:44.91]Fuck!
[201:45.45]I didn't even get a drink!
[201:47.53]You wanna go?
[201:50.69]I didn't get...
[202:12.08]I- I can't- I- I can't talk.
[202:16.44]Okay?
[202:23.11]Here we go.
[202:25.55]In 3... 2... 1!
[202:27.53]Shoot him!
[202:32.07]Shoot him in the fucking head!
[202:43.03]Okay.
[202:45.85]Why are people running from me?
[202:55.61]So I was trying to hit right trigger there.
[202:56.95]I think it's circle to like place an X. I'm going to try to shoot somebody in the hand next time.
[203:07.78]You know that wasn't on purpose because I wouldn't be able to do that if I tried.
[203:17.98]Let's just do this one properly this time.
[203:22.10]Don't fuck it up.
[203:28.86]I'm getting very used to riding around on the horse, though.
[203:35.53]Where is it?
[203:35.93]Right here?
[203:37.63]To the right.
[203:38.15]There it is.
[203:41.37]Here is Mr. I eat people person.
[203:46.43]You can hear me chewing.
[203:47.15]No, you can't.
[203:51.91]There he is.
[203:53.51]Don't fuck it up.
[203:54.69]Just go talk to him.
[203:55.61]We've already seen this before.
[203:56.75]We know what the deal is.
[203:57.81]Go get the guy.
[203:59.79]Go lasso this guy.
[204:01.03]What?
[204:12.17]Got him.
[204:13.17]Come here.
[204:15.09]No.
[204:15.19]Nobody shoving.
[204:15.63]Nobody punching.
[204:23.31]Just bring him back.
[204:27.65]This is not the funny man mission.
[204:29.05]No, it's not.
[204:29.49]This is the other one.
[204:30.83]I've been doing... To be fair, though, I have been doing this one since, like, the beginning of the game, right?
[204:37.68]So this is, like, part four.
[204:41.90]This is, like, part four or five, right?
[204:47.23]Alright.
[204:50.17]Here you go.
[204:52.32]Get him away from me.
[204:53.58]Yeah.
[204:53.82]Wait, what?
[205:21.41]Decide to save the man or let the cannibal eat him?
[205:23.11]I'm not going to let a cannibal eat somebody.
[205:27.47]How do we dispose of him?
[205:33.78]Alright, here we go.
[205:38.90]Cut him free.
[205:40.40]What?
[205:41.94]No, cut him.
[205:43.32]Just relax.
[205:51.05]We do.
[205:51.37]We got it.
[205:55.27]Need some honor.
[206:00.47]Deadly assassin menu updated.
[206:02.04]That's money.
[206:02.66]Okay.
[206:04.70]Kill this eater.
[206:08.04]Chicken salad.
[206:10.46]Just a little chicken salad.
[206:11.88]No big deal.
[206:14.52]Alright, got that one out of the way.
[206:17.24]My fame's going up too.
[206:18.46]Oh, cool.
[206:31.04]No, not another one of these hang my buddy things.
[206:34.33]You know what?
[206:34.65]I'm going to fucking nip this in the butt right now.
[206:39.27]I don't care about your buddy.
[206:41.16]Now you'll never ask me to save your friend ever again.
[206:44.64]Because you're not going to be alive.
[206:46.32]We're not doing that again.
[207:01.11]I'm not, that's like the third fucking time I'd have to do that.
[207:07.75]Alright, where are we going?
[207:09.96]It is pretty good logic.
[207:13.36]Let's sit our ass down here.
[207:15.20]Let's go back to Irish.
[207:16.28]No.
[207:17.70]I want to do a Dickens one.
[207:21.43]Let's go back to Benedict's.
[207:40.56]Oh, I was told to change outfits too.
[207:42.46]I will.
[207:49.13]What am I eating?
[207:49.65]I'm eating... It's chicken salad.
[207:51.23]It's very good.
[207:51.61]Let's go to Benedict Point.
[208:04.74]And chicken salad is gone.
[208:10.73]What am I having along with that?
[208:13.15]I'm having chicken salad.
[208:15.03]And in the chicken.
[208:17.31]It's pretty standard stuff.
[208:20.20]There is... Just some Italian bread.
[208:24.74]Very simple.
[208:25.32]Just a little snack.
[208:26.12]No big deal.
[208:33.58]Going to the big W.
[208:40.06]You're eating spaghetti?
[208:40.80]Spaghetti's great.
[208:43.12]I love spaghetti.
[208:44.38]Pasta's like 10 out of 10.
[208:49.51]Al dente is a little chewy.
[208:51.31]Oh, it's so good.
[208:59.05]Come on.
[208:59.35]If this was an SUV, it would be able to get up here.
[209:01.91]Come on.
[209:02.37]Prove everybody that I picked the right horse.
[209:04.16]See?
[209:04.62]He picked the right horse.
[209:11.19]Other horse definitely was not going to be able to do that.
[209:13.55]Picked the right one.
[209:19.24]Describe the taste.
[209:29.29]What is the core?
[209:29.99]There we go.
[209:30.51]Finally.
[209:31.55]Easy, easy.
[209:32.03]Don't run into somebody.
[209:32.85]Okay, good.
[209:34.59]Finally, we can do this mission.
[209:39.09]Wait, that's the original horse?
[209:40.75]Wait, what?
[209:46.60]That's the horse.
[209:53.22]That's so stupid.
[209:56.40]You don't implore me.
[209:59.63]Nobody implores me.
[210:00.65]I'm my own employee.
[210:03.25]I'm my own self-made millionaire.
[210:04.81]Nobody implores me.
[210:06.71]But my plan is still sound.
[210:08.85]Together we can conquer, if not the world, then certainly Bill Williamson.
[210:12.54]But first, you need me to do you a favor?
[210:16.20]You read my mind.
[210:17.58]I can only deduce you've been taking my tonic, sir, as instructed.
[210:21.64]It can give the most ordinary of intelligences a remarkable insight.
[210:27.14]Self-made hundred air.
[210:27.84]Yeah.
[210:45.49]I am about to do something, which I greatly discourage in all wise and rational men, a selfless act for you.
[210:56.20]But sir, before I act selflessly, allow me to act selfishly and sell some of my wares.
[211:04.68]Content.
[211:04.88]Yeah, there it is.
[211:05.22]Am I gonna play Undead Nightmare?
[211:06.55]I think I will.
[211:33.29]Mingle with the crowd until the show starts.
[211:35.72]Not another one of these.
[211:37.76]Do I have to do this again?
[211:42.10]Ladies and gentlemen, gather round!
[211:45.56]Gather round!
[211:47.60]Goddamn.
[211:50.40]That guy throws his hands in the air.
[211:51.82]Hold on.
[211:54.59]Wait, wait, wait.
[211:55.27]Hold on a second.
[211:57.79]I want, like, a fucking dynamite, man.
[212:05.66]I can't disrupt him?
[212:06.68]I can't get in his wagon.
[212:07.90]Whatever.
[212:08.23]Let's mingle.
[212:08.59]Mingling.
[212:08.79]Currently mingling.
[212:32.80]What do you want me to do?
[212:33.42]Oh, okay.
[212:33.68]Didn't we do this like an hour and a half ago?
[212:35.08]We're going to get another superpower.
[212:38.09]Watch this.
[212:51.78]What are my whores doing?
[212:52.54]Was that Justin Roiland that said that, by the way?
[212:56.18]Uh, get in.
[212:56.82]Get in!
[213:23.40]I've got to radar zoom by pressing- okay.
[213:26.02]Ah, this guy's just shooting at us.
[213:30.13]Yeah, you'd probably duck.
[213:36.45]Riding the passenger seat in the wagon is also known as riding shotgun.
[213:39.94]Yeah, how did we- were we not supposed to know that?
[214:00.28]Is he alive?
[214:04.40]Yeah, he did get hit.
[214:05.23]Let's do the rifle.
[214:06.93]Rifle's better for this.
[214:07.81]He's using a shotgun.
[214:12.27]I'm not gonna do the shotgun riding shotgun.
[214:22.61]That's a zigzag!
[214:26.80]So is the multiplayer for this game any good?
[214:29.80]The joke writes itself, Jeremy.
[214:32.84]Like his hack got knocked off?
[214:56.84]No, he hasn't watched.
[215:00.42]Good.
[215:00.74]That guy is in trouble.
[215:02.84]That guy just drove off.
[215:05.08]No, he's still here.
[215:06.11]Shoot the crates of TNT.
[215:13.73]What crates of TNT?
[215:14.85]Those crates?
[215:16.65]Oh, that!
[215:18.16]Well, I did it.
[215:19.12]Are you proud of me, Mom?
[215:25.58]For a man of the people, he sure ain't very popular.
[215:29.08]You need to look back on how it got knocked down.
[215:32.62]Did I do it?
[215:33.50]I'm not sure we're out of the woods yet.
[215:37.62]Maybe I did.
[215:39.72]Maybe you need to think about a change of career.
[215:42.93]I will never give up on science, Doc.
[215:47.65]That guy just changed to be Driver?
[215:51.83]That was pretty slick.
[215:53.09]Unfortunately, I didn't get them in any better water.
[215:56.79]Well, I ain't surprised.
[215:58.71]That tonic I drank at Ridgewood went through me like a dose of salt.
[216:04.67]What a fail.
[216:09.55]What a fail.
[216:14.38]Let's get closer.
[216:15.68]My God, there's an army of them!
[216:21.40]I love when they get trampled by their own horses and they get dragged to their... Wait, I thought that guy was in a tank.
[216:30.99]Honestly thought that was a tank.
[216:37.39]Over the ridge, it looked like it was tanked.
[216:39.19]That's just shit.
[216:40.56]It's like, who got into my game?
[216:42.42]Who's hacking me right now?
[216:50.40]Up top?
[216:53.59]Where?
[216:53.95]Oh, around here.
[216:54.79]Didn't need auto-aim for that one.
[217:04.57]Just missed three times.
[217:05.73]No big deal.
[217:23.15]He shot the gun out of his hand and he had another gun.
[217:25.09]That guy had plenty of guns.
[217:28.03]Yeah, we win.
[217:33.54]Nice work, Knopflinger.
[217:51.71]Tank's coming.
[217:54.61]Wave a second.
[217:56.31]Well, that was a little hairy.
[217:58.13]Thank you, my dear boy.
[217:59.71]You saved the day again.
[218:01.67]That's what I do.
[218:03.87]I save the day.
[218:05.01]I am a day saver.
[218:06.29]It always impresses me with the speed with which a group of men can turn from passive sheep into murderous wolves.
[218:13.41]I'm impressed with how you nearly got us killed back there.
[218:16.95]Yes, perhaps we should...
[218:18.95]No.
[218:19.39]Oh, no.
[218:19.67]More races.
[218:20.29]Actually, I didn't do that bad in that last race.
[218:23.35]Should I just go right to the race?
[218:25.57]I'm just going to get this over with.
[218:50.62]There's one of those Freaks and Geeks quests in here.
[218:53.14]He just hangs out over here?
[219:01.57]Uh... What are you... Are you fucking serious?
[219:18.13]He's just like...
[219:22.93]This fucking magician.
[219:24.99]This guy.
[219:26.43]Okay.
[219:30.24]He's just peeing again.
[219:43.96]How many times does he just go over and do it again?
[219:48.28]He's going to pee over here too, isn't he?
[219:50.95]It's all those elixirs, man.
[219:52.17]They just go right through you.
[219:58.66]Can I get in his- I need like- I need my fucking horse right now.
[220:02.08]This is really important.
[220:04.62]He's gonna do it again.
[220:07.54]He's looking for the- he's like a dog.
[220:08.75]He's looking for the perfect place to go to the bathroom.
[220:12.29]He's like sniffing around trying to find a place to go pee.
[220:27.36]Just whip it out and get a golden stream going.
[220:32.64]Hey, get your golden stream on my stream.
[220:37.99]He'll do it.
[220:40.49]He's going to do it, and then we're going to ram into him when he's in mid-piss.
[220:49.61]Maybe not.
[220:49.99]Maybe he only has two peas in him.
[220:59.64]Funny streamer.
[221:01.20]That was a deliberate shitty joke.
[221:03.38]Come on.
[221:03.74]Give him some credit.
[221:04.74]I don't know if he's going to pee again.
[221:08.02]I don't think he is.
[221:14.17]No, I think we lost our opportunity.
[221:16.03]Oh well.
[221:18.45]Maybe I can knock the pee into him.
[221:21.67]Maybe he has to pee now.
[221:23.53]I just jiggled his bladder a little.
[221:32.01]Piss waiting room.
[221:34.12]Here he goes.
[221:35.22]Right?
[221:35.92]Nope.
[221:36.90]Alright, last opportunity and we're leaving.
[221:43.14]Just go to the bathroom.
[221:44.82]No, don't fucking stretch.
[221:48.02]Alright, we're leaving in three seconds.
[221:55.67]What?
[221:57.85]What?
[222:00.13]What the fuck?
[222:01.00]Oh, I went to... Okay.
[222:01.54]We're good.
[222:03.44]I guess we're just doing this now.
[222:09.47]How wonderful to see you, sir.
[222:10.79]He just zipped up.
[222:11.67]How wonderful.
[222:13.21]Are we ready, then?
[222:14.73]Yes, sir.
[222:15.61]Nearly, sir.
[222:16.33]I just missed it.
[222:17.46]Nearly, sir.
[222:18.24]I just need some cash to get some extra hardware fitted to my old coach horse here.
[222:24.36]You what?
[222:25.72]Never mind, sir.
[222:27.24]I can only presume that you have not enjoyed the benefits of a classical education.
[222:31.73]He didn't wash his hands.
[222:32.59]So I will not take umbrage if some of my illusions sail over your head, sir.
[222:38.16]I won't pretend to understand you, but I will if you understand me.
[222:42.62]Either we do this right now, or I put a bullet in you and get on with my day.
[222:46.72]Please, I knew you were a violent man, Mr. Marston, but I did not think you were a stupid one.
[222:52.05]We need money to outfit my carriage, to turn a simple tradesman's vehicle into something more...
[222:58.59]Hey, Red Head Redemption, thank you for the five dollars.
[223:20.36]They say, Redhead Redemption 27.
[223:22.26]Five bucks.
[223:24.15]For my last bits, I want to say thank you, Jerma, for providing my friends and I with too many laughs over the years.
[223:27.81]Here's to you.
[223:28.53]Well, here's to you, Redhead.
[223:32.20]Thank you for the generous amount of money.
[223:36.52]Much appreciated.
[223:39.52]And also, uh, 0-0-0-0-0-0, a bunch of zeros, uh, gave bits, too.
[223:43.58]Thanks a lot for your bits, Jeremy.
[223:45.06]Didn't you eat a whole tray of Oreos and throw up in your mom's, in my mother's bed, actually?
[223:49.02]Not my bed.
[223:49.39]Time to lose at a race.
[223:50.89]Yep, time to lose immediately at a race and then win at some.
[223:54.01]Ah, before knowledge comes down, my dear boy.
[224:02.50]Can I just beat him there?
[224:03.26]I'm just gonna beat him there.
[224:05.88]Just beat him there.
[224:06.80]Just have to get there.
[224:10.16]He's not a mini-map blip.
[224:11.42]Just get there.
[224:11.86]How much further up the road is it?
[224:15.30]Is somebody trying to get a cowboy Jupiter?
[224:19.60]Did it work?
[224:21.14]I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of funny dialog there, but...
[224:29.31]Sometimes you just gotta get to the race.
[224:31.43]Really fast.
[224:36.18]There we go.
[224:39.10]Rat skeleton farm.
[224:41.71]Rat skelly farm.
[224:43.31]Line up at the position... Do I need a horse?
[224:46.43]Is this a race where I run?
[224:47.55]Is this a running race?
[224:54.28]My fucking god.
[224:57.57]No.
[224:57.93]Just please put me here.
[224:59.05]Put me right here.
[225:00.49]Just put me right there when I came up.
[225:03.04]God damn it.
[225:26.24]I just, like, I didn't think that, like, bumping into those people was gonna end the whole mission.
[225:31.86]How do you not do that on purpose?
[225:32.92]Like, I did, like, do it on purpose.
[225:34.42]I just thought I was gonna run somebody over.
[225:35.96]I didn't think I was gonna start the mission over.
[225:37.78]That wasn't... I didn't do that because I was like, I don't understand.
[225:44.04]Running into people hurts them.
[225:45.83]No, I wanted to run... I wanted to run that fucking lady over.
[225:49.03]I wanted to trample that guy.
[225:51.39]I didn't think I was gonna restart the mission.
[226:02.00]This time, don't do it again.
[226:03.02]Just get in line.
[226:04.94]There's nobody here.
[226:08.45]Oh, okay.
[226:09.87]Don't touch any dogs.
[226:10.83]Look at these dog landmines, by the way.
[226:14.11]Look at how these people are all set up.
[226:15.33]There's chicken landmines, dog landmines, human landmines.
[226:19.36]If I touch any of these things, it's over.
[226:24.86]Okay, we're good.
[226:29.85]Gentlemen, this will be a fair race.
[226:33.43]No shooting, stabbing, cliff pushing, rock throwing, cactus grinding, neck lassoing, setting fires, or other acts to come.
[226:43.85]Hey, JKY, he's got like a smash keyboard name, but thank you for the 10 bucks.
[226:48.55]One corkscrew pasta, two beef, oh, oh, oh, hold on.
[227:02.48]I was like, somebody has like a fucking recipe over here.
[227:08.96]Don't worry, I can salvage this.
[227:15.07]I'm okay.
[227:15.59]We're good.
[227:17.03]Give me a second.
[227:17.53]I'm gonna read, I'm gonna read what you said in a minute.
[227:19.49]I gotta get to the first place first though.
[227:20.93]Let me just pass Toad.
[227:30.02]Let me pass Toad and then Koopa Troopa.
[227:34.74]And we're gonna be fine.
[227:37.72]Toad's always in fucking the last place.
[227:40.45]I just passed Mario and then Luigi.
[227:41.97]They're always in first and second place.
[227:48.83]First place.
[227:55.28]Stay on the road and we got this.
[227:59.45]Almost as random as those people.
[228:03.05]It's not gonna be easy here, though.
[228:04.63]Get out of the fucking way.
[228:07.63]Random horse.
[228:08.31]I could have gone off that jump, but I didn't want to.
[228:14.55]That was dangerous.
[228:15.70]But she knows me.
[228:22.16]Watch out for Waluigi.
[228:27.28]The most useless fucking video game character ever.
[228:29.34]They need to give him his own game.
[228:32.38]And get proven that- You know, I said this before.
[228:35.22]They need to canonically kill Waluigi.
[228:38.26]Just kill him.
[228:39.50]Just have Koopa, like King Koopa, just fucking drive into him with that stupid, like, clown face boat.
[228:45.86]And run his head over.
[228:47.78]And, like, have his head fucking explode with blood.
[228:50.23]At least that'll give him a reason not to have to put him in, like, shoehorn him into games.
[228:57.32]Either that or, like, prove it, right?
[228:59.06]They can prove it first.
[229:00.38]Make a Waluigi video game.
[229:04.32]Where... You know, Waluigi's grand thievery.
[229:08.42]And have him, like, run around and, like, steal from people.
[229:10.22]And, like, pants people.
[229:11.08]And, like, drop people's pants.
[229:14.18]And it'll sell 92 copies.
[229:20.11]And then we can finally just kill Waluigi.
[229:22.57]We can just drop him, like, into the ocean or something.
[229:25.55]It doesn't even matter.
[229:31.28]I gotta pay attention here.
[229:32.08]I don't wanna lose this.
[229:33.18]We're getting to the home stretch here.
[229:38.52]I need to be able to get some speed.
[229:49.48]We're so far ahead.
[229:56.24]Like, half Waluigi's death be fucking traumatizing.
[230:01.79]Or maybe Nintendo can go the Conqueror's Bad Fur Day route and Waluigi can be their M-rated game.
[230:06.01]Let's have it be like Waluigi's sick fuck adventure.
[230:17.41]He came, he saw, he conquered.
[230:19.17]That would be creepy actually.
[230:21.29]What a fantastic spectacle, John.
[230:23.59]Let's take a moment to bask in the glory of our victory.
[230:28.09]Have we got enough money now?
[230:30.86]I just didn't have a chance.
[230:31.82]And that was, uh, first try.
[230:33.62]I'd enjoy an M-rated Waluigi game.
[230:35.36]Well, he has no, like, purpose anymore.
[230:37.50]Like, Wario is Waluigi, but Wario's kinda cool.
[230:38.84]GTA, but it's Waluigi.
[231:00.50]I got money to spend.
[231:01.98]We do have a freak in here, though.
[231:04.88]Blackjack games can now be entered.
[231:08.10]Oh, don't tell me that.
[231:08.84]Is it the horse?
[231:11.90]What's this guy?
[231:17.36]Hey, partner, I need your help.
[231:20.52]You and every other fool around here.
[231:22.09]I need a better pistol.
[231:23.15]They took my love.
[231:24.39]They stole Jeb's heart and they took her away.
[231:27.65]What are you talking about, friend?
[231:29.55]They took my love.
[231:30.61]They took Jeb's love.
[231:31.95]Oh, Jeb.
[231:32.48]They hide out of tumbleweed.
[231:35.32]Can you help me, partner?
[231:36.76]Partner, can you help me?
[231:39.00]I doubt it.
[231:41.42]Poor Jack.
[231:42.88]He's a mess.
[231:53.47]Low energy quest.
[231:56.91]You're gonna play horseshoes?
[231:58.10]I didn't know you could- Wow.
[232:05.10]Okay.
[232:07.68]This is so cool.
[232:08.12]I didn't know you could actually play horseshoes.
[232:12.92]You can fine-tune the distance by pulling your arm back less.
[232:14.98]Okay.
[232:19.98]How am I liking it so far?
[232:20.76]This game's great.
[232:21.50]This fucking game's awesome.
[232:24.57]Toss the hosher.
[232:25.05]Press the eye stick up and down.
[232:26.35]You can aim left and right with the left stick.
[232:28.11]You can use... Okay.
[232:36.37]And then now what?
[232:40.36]What did I just do?
[232:43.70]What?
[232:45.95]We're betting $1 because it just took me out of that.
[232:50.69]Now you're playing for money.
[232:57.79]My turn now.
[233:03.76]Alright.
[233:05.32]I mean, can I hit somebody down there in the head?
[233:12.15]Is that possible?
[233:12.83]To like throw this all the way over there?
[233:22.46]Zoom in on the pit.
[233:23.24]There we go.
[233:23.78]What are you still doing here?
[233:40.53]I don't know.
[233:50.61]I guess we're doing it again.
[233:52.45]Okay, let's try it again.
[233:58.16]I didn't, like, understand it.
[233:59.18]I have to let it go here.
[234:00.42]We gotta line up.
[234:03.74]We're nice and lined up.
[234:05.54]Bang.
[234:07.20]That was close.
[234:10.84]Move a little bit to the left.
[234:14.76]A little bit.
[234:15.12]That's a little... You win one point.
[234:20.64]I got a point.
[234:22.54]This is the guy crying.
[234:35.09]That sucked.
[234:36.13]Everybody making fun of me.
[234:37.69]Farmer Bill over here.
[234:38.67]That was fucking terrible.
[234:50.85]Hold on.
[234:51.15]I was just trying to... It just slipped out of my head.
[234:53.39]I had a couple of bags of potato chips before I used to get over here.
[235:02.40]I had like fucking two bags of chips before this.
[235:08.43]That was okay.
[235:12.62]Is this Wii bowling?
[235:13.70]Oh, what happens if I... What happens if I go backwards with it?
[235:18.67]Hold on, let me go backwards.
[235:19.57]I want to, like, go backwards fast.
[235:20.93]Let's see what happens.
[235:28.84]Okay, here we go.
[235:32.62]I can't release it.
[235:34.08]What the fuck?
[235:34.94]Oh my god.
[235:42.39]That was, like, perfect.
[235:43.77]No, it fucking wasn't.
[235:51.51]J-Jeb is waiting for you.
[236:02.64]The guy just told me to go on a mission to, like, save his wife.
[236:05.56]He's just bawling over here.
[236:07.78]And I just decided to come play like a horseshoe.
[236:15.02]He is not happy.
[236:16.12]He's calling me out.
[236:20.50]Did you hear that?
[236:21.28]Did you hear that?
[236:26.66]Go look for him, mister.
[236:28.18]What are you doing, please?
[236:33.45]He's so funny.
[236:37.13]Alright, come on, Jeff.
[236:40.29]Alright, we're out.
[236:45.74]Fuck out of the way.
[236:53.07]Blackjack.
[236:53.89]This is where we win some money.
[236:56.15]Alright, time for blackjack.
[237:01.32]Let's win some cash.
[237:02.14]Play blackjack.
[237:02.76]Let's do it.
[237:08.21]Alright, let's do some blackjack.
[237:09.91]If your hand requires a bet in the next round, you can double your bet if your hand warrants.
[237:13.73]Okay, let's just go.
[237:15.61]I know how to play blackjack.
[237:17.10]Come on.

[237:28.12]Immediate blackjack.
[237:29.20]I win.
[237:30.88]Immediate blackjack.
[237:34.15]Thank you for blackjack.
[237:36.71]What do you mean?
[237:37.13]What are you talking about?
[237:38.21]What do I have for cards?
[237:38.95]Where are my cards?
[237:41.19]That's Blackjack!
[237:41.95]I fucking win!
[237:42.49]Blackjack!

[237:49.29]18.
[237:49.31]I win.
[237:49.71]Do it again.
[238:05.32]Here we go, blackjack.
[238:06.90]Oh, we got fucking blackjack.
[238:09.62]You can tell because the cards are both black, see?
[238:18.67]Oh, baby.
[238:19.41]Oh, that was a risky fucking move.
[238:39.67]That's more like it.
[238:47.10]Come on.
[238:50.98]What does he have?
[238:51.52]What's he got?
[238:52.52]Hit me, please, sir.
[238:53.94]What's he got?
[238:54.84]18?
[238:54.86]I mean, like, I'm just going to stand with 19.
[238:58.25]Hit me.
[239:00.09]This dude's going to bust.
[239:00.91]Give me a card, sir.
[239:03.03]No, you're an idiot.
[239:04.99]I win.
[239:05.93]Give me my fucking game.
[239:06.81]Give me my game back.
[239:07.71]That's great.
[239:11.88]Let's do it again.
[239:12.60]10.
[239:14.84]Why can't I look around?
[239:15.70]Is it because people are cheating?
[239:20.39]Alright.
[239:21.07]That's fucking easy money.
[239:23.45]That's a 19.
[239:23.75]What does he got?
[239:25.05]Is he on a 2?
[239:25.85]Good luck.
[239:34.60]12.
[239:34.62]22.
[239:34.66]Get out of here.
[239:35.28]I'll take my money.
[239:36.04]Thank you for the chips.
[239:38.50]Let's go one more.
[239:40.18]One more.
[239:41.46]Let's hopefully get a blackjack here.
[239:50.66]This is 12.
[239:51.44]Hold on.
[239:52.24]Let me look around.
[239:54.67]For a second I thought hit was punch this guy.
[239:56.61]For a second.
[239:58.99]He's getting 19.
[240:00.01]I'm staying with 21.
[240:01.27]Fucking thank you very much.
[240:02.21]I win the game.
[240:03.75]Throw a face card.
[240:06.48]Dealer hits stands at 20.
[240:07.46]I win.
[240:08.96]That was fun.
[240:12.86]I'm out.
[240:13.68]I'm taking my money and I'm leaving.
[240:14.78]I made some money, right?
[240:16.68]I made like 40 bucks.
[240:17.32]Nice.
[240:17.44]I'm okay with that.
[240:21.39]Easy money.
[240:33.79]Hyrola.
[240:34.81]I want to do like a Hyrola table.
[240:41.52]Alright.
[240:42.60]Where to now?
[240:43.12]Let's go.
[240:45.72]There's a lot of random shit to do over there.
[240:50.38]All I have left is Irish.
[240:52.18]Or what do you guys think?
[240:53.42]You want to go do the random stuff over here?
[240:57.02]Or should I just sleep and go to McFarland Ranch and go die?
[241:01.13]I think I'm going to do that.
[241:03.32]Let's just, like, get the story going, you know?
[241:08.15]I can't do that here.
[241:08.89]Is there a coach here?
[241:10.61]Is there a stage coach?
[241:12.03]No.
[241:15.81]Oh, Jeb?
[241:17.47]Forget about Jeb.
[241:20.59]Go help Jeb.
[241:23.35]Alright, I'll help Jeb.
[241:24.52]Fine.
[241:25.50]They're all, like, right over here anyways.
[241:26.90]We're still going.
[241:28.26]We're still playing.
[241:30.64]I'm just gonna do them all.
[241:31.28]I'm gonna do all the quests over there.
[241:34.90]Everyone's, like, crying.
[241:35.88]I know you're doing the cry thing.
[241:37.20]I understand.
[241:37.82]Go, like, rescue Jeb's wife.
[241:41.44]Okay, I will.
[241:51.37]For 2010, this is really, like, very pretty.
[241:55.91]Very well done.
[241:58.64]I see now why people consider this to be, like, one of their favorite games.
[242:01.84]And now I, like, understand why Red Dead 2 is, you know, a pretty huge deal.
[242:07.39]I just wish they would remaster it and put it on PC.
[242:10.37]It's, like, such a crime.
[242:12.01]It's such a shame.
[242:12.75]More like a fucking fantastic game that could be, like, 60 FPS with, like, a higher resolution.
[242:20.83]It's a shame.
[242:24.68]It really is.
[242:30.15]Extreme Red Dead Redemption 2 when it comes out.
[242:31.96]You better believe it.
[242:32.54]Alright, we got here the... I don't know what this is.
[242:36.68]I don't even know what part this one is.
[242:38.72]Let's see.
[242:40.80]What do I want?
[242:42.08]Yep.
[242:55.94]Yeah, you told me to clap.
[242:58.40]Please clap.
[242:59.28]Can you imagine the mods?
[243:00.92]I can't even imagine how fun this game would be with mods.
[243:03.74]There'd be so much insane shit.
[243:04.46]Does Jeb Bush have a mustache?
[243:26.23]No.
[243:28.11]This is Lucy.
[243:28.95]This is Jeb's girl.
[243:32.45]You dumb fool.
[243:34.71]Took it off him about a week ago.
[243:36.37]Oh, I understand now.
[243:37.73]It wasn't a woman.
[243:38.63]It was a horse.
[243:40.11]It was just a horse.
[243:41.15]Oh, yeah.
[243:41.87]We better get her back to her man.
[243:43.26]Damn, now I understand.
[243:44.64]You gonna made my day?
[243:46.16]What a fine romantic woman.
[243:48.38]He's fucking a horse.
[243:52.54]Well, come on, man.
[243:53.98]Okay.
[243:54.38]Alright, follow me.
[244:02.77]What happened what if why hey hey wait a minute I
[244:27.42]How many times is that gonna fucking happen to me?
[244:31.16]Let me at least loot her body.
[244:32.60]I swear to God.
[244:37.01]It says, get on horse.
[244:38.79]I was trying to get on the same one that she was trying to get on, and it fucking didn't... I thought it wanted me to ride with her.
[244:43.65]I don't know, dude.
[244:44.47]I want to be like, ride with her.
[244:46.39]Where's the other one?
[244:47.03]I ain't reloading the save.
[244:48.73]I'm done with it.
[244:49.49]That was a fuck jeb.
[244:51.79]Guys, it didn't even fucking get close in the primaries.
[244:54.41]So who cares?
[244:55.65]Armadillo.
[245:00.78]Where'd it go?
[245:01.18]I wanna see it.
[245:03.06]Where's that armadillo?
[245:03.76]Wow!
[245:05.04]What a fucking beautiful, majestic animal.
[245:09.90]Let's take it, skin!
[245:22.36]Kill it.
[245:22.98]Am I on his horse?
[245:23.88]Where is his horse?
[245:28.04]Which one was his horse?
[245:28.78]I think it ran away.
[245:31.62]Oh well.
[245:36.66]Anyways.
[245:39.18]We're going over there.
[245:40.86]Thank you, Mr. Bush.
[245:46.17]What's wrong with you?
[245:46.95]Oh, you're doing Waluigi.
[245:48.83]Okay, well thank you for the $1.
[245:51.41]And somebody gave $10 earlier.
[245:53.53]But it was in the middle of a race.
[245:56.31]So let me just say, they said one is corkscrew pasta.
[245:59.77]Then you do beef mince.
[246:01.45]Three, tomato paste.
[246:02.54]Four, salt and pepper.
[246:03.70]Five, no onion, but allowed other vegetables.
[246:09.28]JKY Keyboard Mash gave us the recipe for pasta for Juul or something.
[246:14.52]And thank you for the $10.
[246:15.36]I really appreciate it.
[246:17.81]That sounds like a fucking good recipe.
[246:22.93]But thank you.
[246:30.57]Yeah, yeah.
[246:34.59]Could've been a little more sly about that, guys.
[246:39.74]Running down the street.
[246:43.04]What the hell was that?
[246:47.58]What the fuck?
[246:50.32]Such a shitload of animals!
[246:55.45]What?
[246:56.93]That's like 45 wolves.
[247:00.15]Oh, this guy's fucked.
[247:02.78]This guy's fucked.
[247:03.80]This guy's coming down the road right now.
[247:04.98]He's gonna get, like, mauled.
[247:08.22]Are you serious?
[247:11.24]Hey, wait a minute!
[247:16.30]Help!
[247:18.21]Save us!
[247:19.15]Hey!
[247:31.22]Why did he shoot?
[247:35.54]Fucking asshole.
[247:43.86]Well, that was interesting.
[247:45.38]Too bad I got shot in the head with a shotgun.
[247:49.90]I had a dog on me and then a guy shot me in the face.
[247:52.56]Thanks.
[247:54.28]Oh, dear God.
[247:55.56]Are we all the way back here?
[247:57.02]It's okay.
[247:57.88]That's actually a good thing.
[247:58.58]We can go do Jeb again.
[248:06.51]Stupid pedestrians.
[248:10.21]Stupid fucking pedestrians!
[248:11.79]Oh shit, he's alive.
[248:16.85]Alright, well where are we going?
[248:23.48]Aye yi yi.
[248:33.21]Give me my horse.
[248:34.73]Let's just do this again.
[248:40.00]What are you doing?
[248:40.90]Please stop this.
[248:41.68]Can I climb up here?
[248:45.52]Climb up.
[248:46.61]I'm going to ride this.
[248:47.61]I can't.
[248:48.03]Whatever.
[248:48.37]Let's go.
[248:49.19]Come on, lighting.
[248:52.89]Well, let's try that again.
[248:55.33]Wait a minute.
[248:55.89]Yeah, I want to get some new stuff.
[248:56.95]I want to get some new guns.
[248:58.53]Where's the gun show?
[249:00.49]Slow down.
[249:00.91]We're in town.
[249:01.41]This is not like GTA.
[249:02.55]You can't just run people over without repercussions.
[249:12.20]Okay, gunsmith.
[249:15.88]Bait.
[249:16.86]Volcanic pistol.
[249:19.91]Buffalo rifle not available.
[249:27.93]Should I just get the volcanic pistol?
[249:30.23]It's just much better, right?
[249:35.99]No, it's not available.
[249:40.71]One bullet.
[249:42.83]Do I want to make cookies later?
[249:43.87]Of course I do.
[249:44.59]Absolutely.
[249:45.03]That sounds, like, awesome.
[249:45.91]That sounds amazing.
[249:49.07]So I just get the volcanic pistol and the bandolier?
[249:51.48]I mean, I can afford it.
[249:59.98]What can I sell?
[250:01.06]Horse hide.
[250:01.58]Oh, yeah.
[250:02.47]Let's just sell this shit.
[250:06.45]Didn't I get armadillo meat?
[250:10.12]Volcanic pistol is garbage, really.
[250:13.80]Why?
[250:17.33]Volcanic pistol sucks, so should I just wait until I can get the buffalo rifle?
[250:20.19]I guess maybe I will.
[250:27.33]I'll get the band.
[250:27.87]I'll get the band.
[250:29.01]Might as well own it, right?
[250:43.18]And let's go in the general store.
[250:44.24]I just want to see what's in here.
[250:47.24]Oh, the doctor.
[250:47.84]Okay.
[250:48.12]Chewing tobacco.
[250:48.72]What does chewing tobacco do?
[250:50.30]Refills Deadeye.
[250:51.16]Okay.
[250:52.70]Refills horse stamina.
[250:54.12]And this just completely restores your health.
[250:55.97]I don't think I need any of these.
[251:01.57]Double ammo.
[251:02.95]Alright, let's do another attempt.
[251:06.23]This guy's going to duel me.
[251:07.13]Watch.
[251:07.57]Guaranteed.
[251:07.99]Told you.
[251:08.23]He's like, I want to duel you!
[251:15.26]He just spit on me.
[251:16.42]We're gonna duel.
[251:25.85]Get to the dueling section.
[251:33.81]Let's not kill him this time.
[251:34.79]No, I'm not gonna kill him.
[251:35.67]I'm gonna shoot his hand.
[251:36.48]I'm gonna shoot him right in the hand.
[251:39.14]I'm gonna knock the pistol out of his hand.
[251:49.94]And we're going to make 10 times more money.
[251:59.68]I got him in like the hip.
[252:03.09]Okay.
[252:04.57]What is going on?
[252:19.79]Huh?
[252:25.95]I did shoot.
[252:27.93]I shot him.
[252:30.15]I fucking swear to God.
[252:36.09]Well, that guy's now pretty famous, apparently.
[252:38.66]Hold it.
[252:42.36]I didn't think I'd do that.
[252:44.30]Look, the tutorial didn't teach me anything, alright?
[252:48.33]We'll do it again.
[252:48.97]He's gonna be right here.
[252:49.73]He's not even here.
[252:50.69]I don't care.
[252:51.57]What am I doing?
[252:52.41]Like, what the fuck am I doing?
[252:53.11]Like, I'm just so angry right now.
[253:21.97]Forty fucking dollars.
[253:23.01]No, just fuck.
[253:23.92]Just kill me.
[253:24.48]Can I?
[253:35.07]This horse sucks.
[253:50.44]I was just beating the shit out of his horse.
[253:51.96]Yeah, that's why I, like, threw him off.
[253:56.36]Alright, goodbye.
[253:57.29]Thanks for the ride.
[254:02.07]Yeah, I came.
[254:02.89]I wanted by the law.
[254:03.81]Let's just go to Irish.
[254:05.53]This is a thieves' landing.
[254:06.87]Let's go.
[254:13.79]Jeb's curse.
[254:14.46]It really is.
[254:15.38]Fucking give me a break.
[254:24.13]That does not sound good.
[254:31.25]Go get your own horse.
[254:39.14]That makes me feel terrible.
[254:41.36]I love rats.
[254:46.88]This gentleman must be the mysterious stranger's friend?
[254:54.05]What gentleman?
[254:56.47]This guy?
[254:59.69]Is the guy somebody's friend?
[255:07.10]I get... What are we looking at here?
[255:12.56]Oh, okay.
[255:13.10]I guess he's just like in here somewhere.
[255:14.54]Okay.
[255:15.50]Whatever.
[255:18.76]Press Y to give advice.
[255:26.27]Screams?
[255:28.99]Oh, we got an opportunity here.
[255:32.63]The person's getting kidnapped.
[255:34.71]Liars, dice, kidnap.
[255:35.76]Wait, is there swindle stones in this game?
[255:37.60]Alright, let's get this guy.
[255:44.76]That's like not that bright, is it?
[256:00.37]Where are you taking her, by the way?
[256:01.91]I don't know.
[256:02.77]I just decided to grab a person.
[256:05.25]I was going to go this way, but then I decided to turn around.
[256:11.34]Why are you aiming at me?
[256:13.94]I'm being aimed at for some reason.
[256:15.72]I don't know why.

[260:01.20]Lookit, where is she going?
[260:04.46]It's raining outside and it's dark.
[260:06.11]Why are you running out of the town?
[260:08.21]There's werewolves out there.
[260:09.61]Where we going, Smiley Grogan?
[260:15.53]We gonna do like a fucking tuna factory robbery?

[260:42.57]Smila Grogan and the Great Tuna Factory Robbery.
[260:49.21]This is your last chance, you good-for-nothing shyster.
[260:51.83]You've already wasted too much of my time.
[260:58.33]And somebody's got the Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
[261:01.77]We got it.
[261:03.45]Grand Chevy.
[261:05.29]Grand Chevy.
[261:06.53]Mr. Dungo.
[261:08.11]He's got it.
[261:08.51]The Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
[261:10.49]Stick with me and keep quiet.
[261:13.28]Can you keep quiet?
[261:13.90]That means it's a stealth mission.
[261:15.61]That means we have to crouch.
[261:16.49]I hear a fight.
[261:17.11]Interrogation.
[261:39.09]Shakey, you wretched fucking son of a whore.
[261:42.89]Suck my... Again!
[261:45.05]Again!
[261:47.05]Labor relations don't sound like they're exactly... At an old time, I... You sneak in and get poor Shakey loose.
[261:56.02]I'll go get the wagon.
[261:57.20]Sniff his ass.
[261:58.08]Good luck, master.
[261:59.06]So I gotta sneak in.
[261:59.69]He's a good man, that Shakey.
[262:01.49]Remove the waypoint.
[262:02.29]I'm sorry.
[262:02.73]It's just been on there the whole time.
[262:07.67]Here, let me get the waypoint off the map.
[262:09.09]Alright, and everybody doesn't freak out.
[262:11.03]Alright, so just walk in the front door.
[262:17.05]I can't, okay.
[262:17.93]Can't go in that way.
[262:19.45]Why can't I just go in the front door?
[262:22.67]I should be able to.
[262:23.29]It's kind of bullshit.
[262:30.50]Go up again, right?
[262:35.66]We're gonna do like a rooftop breakthrough?
[262:37.36]Sneak in through the window.
[262:43.38]Which window?
[262:43.82]This one?
[262:45.40]Why do I go in the one they're in?
[262:46.44]Whoa, that was slippery.
[262:52.33]That was very slippery.
[262:53.55]There's a patrol.
[263:03.27]Is there a like stealth kill?
[263:05.35]I don't think there is.
[263:06.98]I've not yet seen it.
[263:10.06]That was a lot of noise, but we're okay.
[263:26.58]There is a stealth kill.
[263:29.54]There is a stealth kill.
[263:31.47]Delve kill.
[263:32.49]Got it.
[263:35.81]What?
[263:38.67]How?
[263:41.03]How would you know that was happening?
[263:44.55]Okay.
[263:55.29]Where?
[263:58.45]Hurry!
[263:59.59]Get these ropes off me!
[264:03.50]They saw the body?
[264:04.38]Is his name Shaggy?
[264:04.96]Well, now we gotta escape.
[264:05.94]Here comes the fire fight.
[264:07.18]Someone's got a gun.
[264:34.00]And just stand up.
[264:36.12]And... Beautiful.
[264:36.86]That was beautiful.
[264:39.84]He's dead, right?
[264:41.80]This guy isn't.
[264:58.60]Dead?
[264:59.54]Not dead?
[265:00.54]Alive?
[265:01.26]He's alive.
[265:02.80]Alright.
[265:05.06]Come on this way.
[265:08.43]Uh, I'm gonna take the medicine just because I haven't done it one time.
[265:13.59]No, that's bait.
[265:16.59]Don't use the bait.
[265:17.51]Don't tap on the head.
[265:35.31]Perfect!
[265:36.13]Get the shotgun out, this is probably better.
[265:43.99]Open the gate.
[265:45.41]Okay.
[265:45.59]This is where, uh... This is where Lucky is, whatever his name is.
[265:50.89]Yep.
[266:08.12]That's never going to be not funny.
[266:13.34]That's always going to be fun.
[266:18.84]That's so funny how like that is just Overwatch.
[266:28.63]Got it again.
[266:29.13]I'm going to get up top.
[266:32.33]I'm going to be like a real McCree.
[266:42.23]Just like a real McCree would do.
[266:45.44]Come on, where is he?
[266:52.90]Oh, well.
[266:53.84]What?
[266:54.82]Where are they?
[266:56.28]Oh, they're hiding right there.
[267:07.97]Follow.
[267:08.29]Shake it to the machine gun ammo.
[267:10.56]First, let me do this.
[267:14.92]Just like a real McCree, you get one guy.
[267:19.32]Just like a real McCree.
[267:20.88]You didn't do shit.
[267:22.02]I love that.
[267:22.50]More than anything.
[267:23.32]That was a lot of swears.
[267:45.72]Alright, hop on.
[267:46.58]I'll get this out of here.
[267:48.42]This is a bad place to be idling, fella.
[267:50.72]Did you have fun in there, you and shaky?
[267:53.52]I killed a lot of men for this damn machine gun of yours.
[267:56.79]I'm sorry, I missed all the drama.
[267:58.39]Do we actually get to do a machine gun mission?
[267:59.87]You always miss all the drama.
[268:01.51]There must be cobwebs growing on that holster of yours.
[268:04.83]Someone's got to drive the wagon, don't they?
[268:07.29]Teamwork, Johnny boy.
[268:08.57]That's my game, not just a glory like you.
[268:14.65]And here come people chasing after us.
[268:17.69]What do you know?
[268:26.02]Protect the wagon from the bandits.
[268:27.98]For the five thousandth time.
[268:29.70]Yep.
[268:45.68]It amazes me how many goons these tiny operations have.
[268:51.14]Yeah.
[268:52.64]This gang has like 500 people in it.
[268:55.30]Maybe even more.
[268:56.46]I want to make more money.
[268:57.60]I want to like buy a grenade.
[268:58.87]And more dynamite.
[269:00.09]Bridge?
[269:14.39]Huh?
[269:14.63]That was easy.
[269:15.15]Dude, nobody's shot at you in a long time.
[269:16.99]Here we go.
[269:36.36]Anytime you want to shoot somebody, Irish, please feel free.
[269:39.36]How come nobody else shoots?
[269:40.40]I'm the only guy that does anything in this whole time.
[269:42.93]Everybody else is just, like, stealing people.
[269:46.59]People get kidnapped and, like, eaten.
[269:48.39]That's what every townsperson does in this game.
[269:51.29]I'm telling you, Irish, that machine gun had better work after all this.
[269:55.66]Don't you worry.
[269:56.64]You won't find a finer piece of artillery west of Dublin.
[270:00.54]So this is the big turning point in the game.
[270:02.97]I actually go attack Fort Mercer with like a minigun.
[270:09.78]I guess this is where we part ways, Johnny Marston.
[270:12.06]That'd be fun.
[270:12.86]Or maybe not, friend.
[270:14.30]You're going to be right alongside me when I take on that port.
[270:17.54]After all you put me through.
[270:18.48]Take on Fort Mercer.
[270:19.44]You pulled the damn trigger for once.
[270:21.54]Show me what a big, bad killer you really are.
[270:24.42]Uh, yes.
[270:25.18]Alright.
[270:26.04]What do I think?
[270:27.16]Don't worry.
[270:27.70]You can count on me.
[270:28.64]I just hope I don't steal all your glory.
[270:30.76]Wouldn't be right, my father?
[270:33.12]I'm sorry.
[270:33.48]It's scaring the horses.
[270:35.23]Impressive, Marston.
[270:36.57]We'll have Wes Dickens' wagon rigged and ready to go
[270:40.53]Does Matt Mercer voice the wall in Mercer City?
[270:50.45]Fame.
[270:52.75]Notoriety.
[270:56.15]Okay.
[270:57.85]We got M. Survivalist map.
[271:05.03]Shows nearby herbs.
[271:08.27]Towns, settlements, landmarks, and hideouts in Henningstede allows fast travel from camp.
[271:11.57]You know what?
[271:12.13]Some of these might be actually worth having.
[271:17.55]That was the worst joke I've heard in several weeks.
[271:19.51]Oh, I know.
[271:22.50]Trust me.
[271:22.82]I know about that.
[271:23.66]I know.
[271:34.46]This dog.
[271:35.06]The dog comes before everybody else.
[271:38.28]Swindlestones?
[271:40.98]Is it available?
[271:42.64]It's over here, right?
[271:46.10]Where is... What is this?
[271:49.13]Horse breaking job.
[271:50.15]Renewable property.
[271:51.05]Support Mercer.
[271:54.63]Where's Swindlestones?
[272:01.75]Poker.
[272:02.13]It's these landing, right?
[272:02.93]Oh, I can get a haircut.
[272:07.14]That's right here.
[272:07.70]Okay, we need to go to Thieves Landing.
[272:10.76]Stagecoach, please take me to Thieves Landing.
[272:16.21]We can go play Swindled Stones.
[272:19.43]And now let's go get her.
[272:37.27]Do the Stranger mission.
[272:39.93]Just go on a murdering spree and then reload.
[272:41.97]No.
[272:48.38]Before I do Fort Mercer, I'm going to do the other missions.
[272:51.86]I'm going to do Fort Mercer before anything extreme, absolutely.
[272:54.00]Alright, let's place Moondlestones, go do the Stranger missions, Fort Mercer, and then we're going to call it for tonight.
[273:08.97]Where is it?
[273:09.39]Dice.
[273:12.85]There's nobody there playing dice right now.
[273:16.85]Liar's dice.
[273:26.86]Nobody's playing liar's dice right now.
[273:28.18]Why?
[273:28.72]Come on.
[273:35.76]There we go.
[273:36.18]Nobody's playing it now.
[273:40.22]That guy's sleeping, or is that guy dead?
[273:44.26]No, duh, I wanted to- God damn it, like, honest to God, I wanted to fucking- This guy's aiming at my head.
[273:53.17]Okay, we're good.
[274:02.45]Anybody want to play dice?
[274:07.98]God damn it.
[274:09.25]I wanted to just fucking punch.
[274:11.71]Sit down.
[274:12.79]Sit down so we can play dice.
[274:18.05]Come on.
[274:19.31]Dice.
[274:21.24]What's that noise?
[274:26.60]Whatever.
[274:27.18]Okay, let's go to the gunsmith.
[274:28.20]I want to see what the noose... I thought she just threw a grenade on the ground.
[274:36.16]Pulled my gun out and the place went fucking mad.
[274:39.32]Sawed-off shotgun.
[274:42.38]Springfield rifle.
[274:47.86]Hmm.
[274:53.75]No, I don't think so.
[275:00.51]Just buy the property?
[275:01.31]Excuse me, sorry.
[275:03.53]I'm tired.
[275:04.98]I'm not going to buy the property right now.
[275:11.48]I really wish somebody would sit down and play dice.
[275:16.32]All people do is play blackjack.
[275:22.23]What is this over here?
[275:22.97]Is it poker?
[275:28.59]Let's do poker for a minute.
[275:30.95]$25.
[275:31.01]Alright.
[275:37.15]Let's go.
[275:37.47]Let me take the whole fucking pot.
[275:47.46]Okay.
[275:47.72]Fold it.
[275:48.18]Okay.
[275:48.46]King, 10.
[275:49.72]King, 10.
[276:02.50]Let's raise it.
[276:05.24]No, give me the river.
[276:06.34]Give me the first card.
[276:07.04]Okay, this is fine.
[276:11.97]Okay.
[276:12.45]Let's go ahead and call it.
[276:19.09]King 10.
[276:24.03]Call it.
[276:25.21]Come on, give me a fucking king.
[276:32.90]I'm out.
[276:35.10]Yeah, I'm out.
[276:37.95]Alright.
[276:41.81]No, I just said I fold.
[276:43.69]I folded.
[276:47.13]Oh, no, I didn't fold, guys.
[276:48.98]I didn't fucking fold.
[276:50.24]I pressed A, which is X. It's X on the fucking PlayStation 4.
[276:57.20]And that's what happens when you fucking don't play these games.
[277:05.13]Now I have to call.
[277:09.71]Pair of kings.
[277:10.83]Give me that fucking flush.
[277:12.39]Don't even care.
[277:14.97]Ace high.
[277:15.67]You show ace high.
[277:21.78]Un-fucking-believable.
[277:26.66]I wanted to get out of there with losing 20 bucks.
[277:28.70]Instead, I pressed the wrong button.
[277:31.54]Because, like, we... I'm just going to complain about this fucking controller and how I hate it.
[277:37.10]I pressed X. No, sorry.
[277:42.91]X is in the other spot.
[277:45.25]Fuck me.
[277:45.69]Alright, what the fuck was I doing before I just got angry at the fact that I have five buttons in my brain is what's in that spot?
[277:56.59]Oh god, my internet's dying.
[277:57.99]Are we good?
[278:00.68]Can you hear me?
[278:01.14]The internet just kinda died there.
[278:12.46]Well, if the internet dies, if we lose connection here, then I'm sorry.
[278:16.01]But I'm gonna have to call it there if it does die.
[278:25.32]I think we're good.
[278:26.04]I think we're good.
[278:29.18]We might hit some issue.
[278:31.68]We might hit some issues here, though.
[278:33.12]Where's the haircut place?
[278:38.19]Where's the haircut place?
[278:41.41]Poker.
[278:43.35]Taylor.
[278:43.79]There it is.
[278:54.98]Wait, is the doctor and the tailor?
[278:56.56]I'm confused here.
[278:58.78]Wait, what?
[279:03.24]Am I a moron or what?
[279:04.72]I don't understand.
[279:06.98]Where is it?
[279:11.40]Oh, there he is.
[279:11.88]Okay.
[279:12.06]Give me a haircut.
[279:14.56]Elegant soup.
[279:15.88]Elegant soup.
[279:18.60]Bandana.
[279:19.22]It's 20 bucks.
[279:19.87]I can get a bandana, right?
[279:24.06]Let's get a bandana.
[279:25.46]I can do, like, bad shit, right?
[279:33.22]I need to, like, equip it, right?
[279:39.47]It's very useful.
[279:43.23]Can I go upstairs?
[279:44.55]What is upstairs?
[279:46.71]So this guy's not gonna freak out if I walk in his house, right?
[279:51.75]Good.
[279:54.04]Good.
[279:54.34]Talk to the doctor.
[280:00.88]Snake oil.
[280:02.76]Feels Deadeye.
[280:04.40]Deadeye.
[280:05.64]And no Deadeye is consumed for 10 seconds?
[280:07.30]That's fucking crazy.
[280:08.46]Alright, let's go.
[280:13.40]Where do I want to go?
[280:17.56]I want to play the dice game, but nobody's playing it.
[280:23.39]Let's do this stranger... stranger thing.
[280:26.21]Not to be confused with the TV show.
[280:32.50]It's fucking a thousand degrees down here.
[280:39.57]The suit.
[280:40.15]The suit to play dice.
[280:40.99]I'm waiting for it to be available.
[280:42.15]It's not available.
[280:43.15]There it is.
[280:43.51]There we go.
[280:50.26]I wouldn't be surprised if it was like 108 degrees inside of this office right now.
[280:53.78]Like in this room.
[280:54.42]It's driving me insane.
[280:57.44]Alright, how do you play this?
[281:03.14]Welcome to Liar's Dice.
[281:04.20]Each round requires a bet called an ante.
[281:06.76]Please choose if you wish to play or quit.

[281:21.19]To play Liar's Dice, you bid how many dice of a given face are on the table.
[281:24.97]Take a look at your dice and enter a bid.
[281:29.05]Okay, so it is like Swindle Stones.
[281:32.65]Five.
[281:33.23]I have one, two.
[281:34.19]I have one, three, four, five, six.
[281:38.04]Well, I'm going to say there's like... Well, there has to be at least like two sixes.
[281:50.91]I'll bid.
[281:55.01]Three ones.
[281:55.67]Okay, three ones.
[282:01.80]That's possible.
[282:05.32]Five threes.
[282:07.24]No way.
[282:08.94]No, there's no way.
[282:09.78]Call the bluff.
[282:20.15]This is not five threes.
[282:25.17]He's showing one totaling one.
[282:27.43]When a bid is challenged, the dice are revealed and tallied.
[282:31.01]Yeah.
[282:33.09]So this guy said they were five threes.
[282:40.33]Oh, it's between every... I didn't realize... Okay.
[282:43.53]Okay.
[282:44.93]I didn't realize there were three fucking people playing.
[282:47.05]I thought somebody was like the dealer.
[282:50.88]Okay, I honestly didn't realize that the third guy over there was playing.
[282:54.50]Like, he's not even in fucking camera.
[282:56.58]Alright, I get it.
[282:59.68]So, it's Swindle Stones with three people.
[283:01.54]I thought it was me and one other guy.
[283:04.68]There's two... There are two twos.
[283:06.74]There are... There are at least four twos.
[283:13.58]I'm gonna bid.
[283:16.72]I thought I had one of those trusting faces.
[283:23.09]No, that guy had no twos.
[283:24.31]That guy had three twos, and that's totaling five, so I was right.
[283:29.47]Throw one away, buddy.
[283:30.73]This is going to take a long time with three people.
[283:40.70]Two twos, three twos.
[283:42.50]I don't have any twos.
[283:47.67]I'm just going to say four twos, just to fuck with them.
[283:53.59]And I don't think anyone's going to call that.
[283:56.17]Five twos.
[283:59.28]He called the bluff five twos.
[284:00.56]Let's see if this guy's... This guy's fucked up.
[284:06.32]So he was... He was... Correct.
[284:10.94]He was called the bluff.
[284:12.74]This guy's going to get eliminated.
[284:13.72]Okay.
[284:17.43]One four.
[284:23.35]two sixes so there's at least six okay two sixes so we can go up to so I know he's got two at least two let's just go with three sixes four fours this guy really is all about the fours he's just gonna call it out again
[284:51.12]Okay, there's one.
[284:52.78]Two.
[284:53.92]Three.
[284:55.02]Four.
[284:55.32]Totally out.
[284:55.72]He's it.
[284:57.41]This guy keeps getting fucked.
[284:58.75]Big time.
[284:59.17]One, two.
[285:01.03]Three sixes.
[285:01.59]Damn.
[285:01.75]Three sixes.
[285:23.07]Five sixes.
[285:23.67]Somebody call it.
[285:27.41]Ah, thanks.
[285:27.99]Call the bluff.
[285:31.05]We got one, two, three, four, five.
[285:37.20]Bid was true.
[285:37.84]At least five sixes.
[285:39.84]You lose the die.
[285:41.28]This guy's about to be out.
[285:42.90]These people are getting fucking swindled.
[285:48.09]That guy has one die, by the way.
[285:55.82]I'll be honest, it's kind of hard to follow who is saying what and how many dice they had.
[286:01.60]Three ones.
[286:10.49]I'm going to say that's spot on.
[286:28.73]One.
[286:30.51]None.
[286:30.79]And this guy's got two, right?
[286:32.35]Fuck.
[286:34.53]That guy in the middle has one dice.
[286:42.24]One die.
[286:45.06]Enter initial bid.
[286:46.08]I'm gonna say... Alright, let's go with... Let's just fuck it all up.
[286:52.31]Two... Let's just say something completely fucking wrong.
[286:56.83]Yeah.
[286:57.90]Like two fives.
[287:04.65]Three fives.
[287:05.67]Okay.
[287:06.21]So he has a five.
[287:06.93]So that's one.
[287:07.49]Call the buff.
[287:07.89]This guy's out.
[287:12.71]Zero.
[287:13.96]Zero.
[287:15.64]And one.
[287:16.38]See you later.
[287:16.90]This guy's gone.
[287:17.44]Me versus this guy.
[287:18.24]This is a long game.
[287:27.03]How many does he have?
[287:29.43]One, three.
[287:30.03]How many dice does he have?
[287:34.33]One, three.
[287:41.10]Two threes.
[287:42.78]He has five.
[287:48.61]He might have more than one.
[287:51.77]Three threes.
[287:52.63]Let's just go for it.
[287:56.90]Four threes.
[287:57.68]Okay.
[287:59.22]So that means... That means of his five dice, he has to have three threes.
[288:08.90]I wonder if I should call this.
[288:09.90]He must have three.
[288:11.03]Three out of five must be three.
[288:11.97]That's pretty rare.
[288:12.65]I don't know.
[288:15.23]I think that's a bluff.
[288:17.62]I'm going to call that out.
[288:19.08]There's no way he's got three.
[288:22.08]And if he does, then that's fucking rare and I got fucking ruined.
[288:26.39]He did.
[288:26.73]He had fucking three.
[288:27.57]Great.
[288:31.37]This gets so hard to fucking win.
[288:33.85]Going against 5v2.
[288:34.65]Well, we're going to go with like... I'm just going to throw this into hell here.
[288:47.13]Let's go with one five.
[288:52.47]Two threes.
[288:55.83]I have one three.
[288:56.99]God damn it.
[288:57.53]Does he have a bunch of fucking threes again?
[289:07.08]Three threes.
[289:07.72]That means he must have two.
[289:11.43]Come on.
[289:11.73]He has to have two.
[289:12.33]Why would he do the first bet?
[289:16.37]Two.
[289:16.55]There it is.
[289:16.97]Got him.
[289:19.45]Get rid of the dice.
[289:20.29]Alright.
[289:23.07]Now he's down to one, two, three, four.
[289:25.11]Okay.
[289:29.63]Did he have six or did he have five?
[289:32.67]Three again.
[289:33.39]God damn it.
[289:34.57]I have no threes.
[289:36.15]I'm just going to keep it going.
[289:37.37]Two threes.
[289:38.39]Calls the bluff.
[289:38.79]Shit.
[289:45.81]Let's see if he has two.
[289:47.43]May has one.
[289:48.00]Now I'm going to lose.
[289:53.04]This is really hard with three people.
[290:02.06]It's almost impossible to win like this.
[290:04.42]1-1.
[290:05.72]I'm just going to say that.
[290:08.62]I'm going to be so live.
[290:12.16]Two ones.
[290:17.30]Does he have two ones?
[290:18.42]Should I just fucking call it out right now?
[290:22.42]I don't know if he has two ones.
[290:23.52]I think he might have one.
[290:29.86]I call your bluff.
[290:32.16]I have to call it.
[290:32.94]He has to have two ones.
[290:34.35]Then he wins.
[290:35.13]Of course he does.
[290:40.43]Of course he does.
[290:41.61]You see that?
[290:47.28]Fuck you, Gaston.
[290:48.22]You're fucking late.
[290:49.04]Your movie sucked.
[290:54.91]Beauty and the Beast remake wasn't even good.
[290:58.39]Nah, I don't want to play.
[291:03.67]Maybe another time.
[291:11.08]Maxim Swindley.
[291:12.52]Encourage the man or discourage the man?
[291:16.91]What are we discouraging or encouraging?
[291:18.66]I'm not sure what the context is here.
[291:23.46]What's the encouragement or the discouragement?
[291:32.60]Excuse me, mister.
[291:33.76]Yeah, what the hell do you want?
[291:35.76]Look, don't ask how, but I know what you're about to do.
[291:39.64]You don't want to do this.
[291:40.86]What the hell are you talking about?
[291:43.04]You know what I'm talking about, mister.
[291:45.32]I'm just here to say I don't think you should go through with it.
[291:48.08]Your wife, she loves you.
[291:50.72]Oh, cheating.
[291:51.30]New widow?
[291:51.70]Don't mention it.
[291:53.45]Go on, then.
[291:54.15]That's it, apparently.
[292:10.07]See all the people walking around behind the bar, bumping into each other?
[292:13.80]Well, that was easy.
[292:14.44]That was an easy 50 on her.
[292:15.48]Alright, let's go ahead and...
[292:46.26]Get out of the way.
[292:47.38]Come on.
[292:47.88]This is important.
[292:55.98]Get... I just want to do something.
[292:59.66]I want to see if it's possible.
[293:01.62]God.
[293:04.64]I was trying to throw him into the water.
[293:06.87]Have your horse back.
[293:07.59]Take it.
[293:09.55]I was hoping I could toss him into the fucking water.
[293:12.77]You can't.
[293:24.09]Fucking do this.
[293:25.17]Come on.
[293:27.49]This is like third time's a charm.
[293:28.97]Come on.
[293:29.39]This is an easy one.
[293:55.30]I've never played this again.
[293:59.26]I have to.
[293:59.82]I pressed it!
[294:04.33]Oh, I win.
[294:07.27]I won.
[294:10.05]Oh, another guy's coming in.
[294:12.45]Okay.
[294:27.29]Okay, this is the real one.
[294:35.14]I thought it was going to be the same fucking thing.
[294:36.72]Okay, I know what it is now.
[294:40.08]No, it's different again.
[294:47.05]I'm never going to do it.
[294:47.83]Damnation.
[294:57.68]I'm never gonna do it.
[294:58.78]It's never gonna happen.
[294:59.44]Nope.
[294:59.56]It's never gonna happen.
[295:25.03]You give me a PlayStation 4 controller, I'll do that without getting hit one time.
[295:33.38]Every time a button pops up, I have to remember where to put my thumb.
[295:36.80]I have no muscle memory for the Xbox.
[295:39.64]I'm gonna say that again.
[295:41.12]I'll say that a thousand times before I'm blue in the fucking face.
[295:44.37]I have no idea where these are.
[295:46.47]I have to, like, look down sometimes.
[295:49.47]In fact, I'm gonna go fucking strangle that guy right now.
[295:52.13]Like, I'm so angry.
[295:53.75]I'm going to put my fucking hands around that guy's neck and choke until he doesn't exist.
[295:58.49]No, fucking... We're doing it to... No fucking pissing on property here.
[296:12.80]Man and woman...
[296:26.10]Oh no, I died!
[296:27.16]Just wanted to reload the fucking area.
[296:40.67]I did that on purpose, are you guys serious?
[296:42.51]I wanted to like, reload the spot.
[296:48.14]Okay, let's go.
[296:51.65]You think I'm gonna, like, slash it fucking backwards?
[296:54.01]Are you serious?
[296:55.39]I'm not that stupid.
[296:56.43]Alright, let's go do, let's do, let's go do Fort Mercer.
[297:03.53]And then I'm gonna call the stream.
[297:12.54]Uh, can I fast travel here?
[297:21.13]Can I just tell you that I can't wait to never turn my fucking Xbox on ever again.
[297:25.31]Like, can I put this thing back in the fucking closet where it's been for the last year and a half?
[297:30.49]Can I just, like, say that out loud?
[297:32.33]I can't wait till this thing becomes a fucking mothball dust magnet again.
[297:35.87]Get the fuck back in, like, the fucking closet, Xbox.
[297:39.51]Where you fucking belong.
[297:48.76]Let's give it up for Sony.
[298:00.01]I'm not insulting the 360, I'm insulting the Xbox One.
[298:02.40]Uh, where do I want to go?
[298:10.24]Fort Mercer.
[298:10.98]Can I travel Rio Bravo or Benedict Point?
[298:12.59]Let's see.
[298:19.27]A round of applause.
[298:24.84]Do I have it?
[298:26.18]Uh, I guess I have to go to Benedict Point.
[298:35.64]Xbox One crashes.
[298:37.69]I mean, I'm gonna be real here.
[298:38.93]I mean, fuck, the Wii U sucks.
[298:42.07]Like, the thing has, like, fucking three games that were worth playing.
[298:46.95]I don't know, I have no opinion on the Switch.
[298:48.62]I really don't.
[298:49.94]Because I haven't, like, really put any time into it or played anything on it.
[298:52.40]Uh...
[298:58.43]I play, like, on PC, but if I'm gonna tell you, like, console-wise, like, the PlayStation 4 is way fucking better.
[299:02.95]It just is.
[299:04.26]It's just a fact.
[299:20.27]Why does it tell me to go this way?
[299:27.10]Actual facts.
[299:33.18]The switch sucks.
[299:33.92]Wait, does it really?
[299:46.20]Also, I'm gonna give you another opinion.
[299:49.12]What's with all these fucking companies making like... How many Xboxes have they made?
[299:53.99]Why are they doing, like, new versions?
[299:55.29]Like the Xbox X, the Xbox S!
[299:56.90]What the fuck are you talking about?
[300:01.68]We're coming out with, like, two new Xboxes!
[300:04.81]And there's, like, another PlayStation 4 coming soon, too!
[300:25.69]That was the good guy, apparently.
[300:27.81]I shot the good guy.
[300:34.22]The X-Xbox XS2.
[300:40.32]Might as well skin him.
[300:41.40]Let's kill everybody, who cares.
[300:55.72]It's so easy to accidentally kill the good guy.
[300:57.82]It kind of is.
[300:58.64]Especially when it's dark.
[301:05.21]Wait.
[301:05.55]Oh, there was treasure there.
[301:07.23]You're right.
[301:07.91]There's treasure there.
[301:08.77]I don't even know where it is.
[301:15.45]I'm like so angry right now that I don't even fucking care.
[301:21.51]Get me the fuck out of this.
[301:27.36]I'm so, like, angry at fucking Xbox right now.
[301:29.58]For no reason.
[301:30.20]Like, they didn't do anything.
[301:31.70]Like, I'm just, like, un-fucking-consolable.
[301:41.36]I'm so angry at, like, Microsoft.
[301:42.98]Of what?
[301:43.56]Actually, no, fuck that.
[301:44.96]Bullshit.
[301:46.14]You saw two streams ago.
[301:48.08]Fuck this company.
[301:48.84]Fuck this dumb shit machine.
[301:50.79]You watched the stream from two days ago.
[301:53.19]I'm allowed to talk shit.
[301:58.90]Uh-huh.
[302:01.52]Uh-huh-huh-huh.
[302:03.68]It's time.
[302:04.56]We must go.
[302:05.84]Why?
[302:06.12]What's happening?
[302:07.52]Seth has managed to get himself inside.
[302:11.12]But we can't leave it too long or they will soon realize how very curious he is and remove him from the premises.
[302:18.31]Or slit his throat and watch him bleed to death.
[302:21.17]But for a minute, he will delight and amuse them.
[302:24.79]That's when he'll get us inside.
[302:28.07]What happened?
[302:28.69]What do I mean?
[302:29.33]Uh, I bought the game and I couldn't play it.
[302:31.05]I spent like two hours trying to get this to work on Xbox One two days ago.
[302:34.95]And then I had to go buy like a physical copy.
[302:36.43]I bought this game twice.
[303:01.84]Now I'm gonna blame like, you know what I'm gonna do?
[303:03.64]I'm gonna buy a fucking air conditioner.
[303:06.66]Right now somebody's holding a hair dryer on my whole body right now.
[303:12.48]You might be a little irritated too if there was a fucking gigantic hair dryer blowing on you at all times the whole day.
[303:19.65]This like sucks in here.
[303:22.23]Do they make like electric hair, like no, not electric hair dryer.
[303:24.85]Do they make like electric air conditioning units that I can like stick in my fucking window?
[303:28.49]This is insanity.
[303:35.76]Did anybody die here?
[303:37.69]Are we doing like a Trojan horse thing?
[303:40.15]I'm derailing.
[303:40.79]I was derailing like 35 minutes ago.
[303:43.37]This Xbox One is overheating.
[304:04.37]Not really taking us on the best route here.
[304:36.36]Sweaty streamer gets mad at innocent video game playing machine and goes into a 25 minute rant.
[304:39.78]It's just the face buttons on the Xbox.
[304:40.88]And that's it.
[304:41.28]That was enough.
[304:42.10]What would you say if I told you I could teach you to fly?
[304:46.50]What would you say if I told you
[305:03.78]I could turn a man into a beautiful woman.
[305:07.66]Impossible, yes, once, but no more.
[305:10.62]Gentlemen, I bring you wisdom from the east.
[305:14.16]I have here in this wagon some of the finest goods, the best medicines, and the newest inventions available for you and your families.
[305:23.20]Exotic trinkets from the far reaches of the Earth.
[305:25.71]Yeah, just sit me in like a fucking hot, like 115 degree room with an Xbox controller and I'll flip out.
[305:31.19]It's that easy.
[305:32.71]Athletic physique.
[305:34.85]This miraculous elixir can keep the muscles supple and relax the cords.
[305:40.98]It loosens the joints and gives a feeling of vigor and freshness to the whole system.
[305:46.84]Why, some men have reported to me that after drinking it for one month, they can chew through steel.
[305:58.57]Holy shit.
[306:01.41]Well, here we go.
[306:02.23]This is what we've all been waiting for.
[306:04.61]Now this.
[306:10.40]THIS is gaming right here.
[306:11.92]And that guy won't die.
[306:25.27]Yeah.
[306:25.47]Anymore?
[306:25.97]It really does look like Westworld over there, for those who haven't seen it.
[306:36.07]Especially this little, this area right there.
[306:47.63]I'm going as fast as I can.
[306:57.31]Last guy, where are you?
[306:58.01]You can't say over there.
[307:00.91]There's a lot of over there's.
[307:01.93]There's Westworld, and I think Westworld is amazing.
[307:08.37]It's a very, very good show.
[307:10.72]Highly recommend.
[307:13.22]Okay, lots of people too.
[307:14.44]Hmm.
[307:27.82]I mean, I could loot all these guys, but that's going to take a while.
[307:30.45]We don't got time for this.
[307:33.09]It's like $5 a person.
[307:36.31]It's not a big deal.
[307:44.77]Whoa, easy.
[307:45.67]Don't get in the way.
[307:46.33]I don't want to shoot you right in the head.
[307:47.95]Please don't get in the way, sir.
[307:48.87]Mmm...
[307:58.33]Down?
[308:05.20]Last guy.
[308:05.86]Across the way.
[308:16.46]Helms deep it.
[308:17.74]Why not?
[308:19.70]That guy got super fucking killed by the way.
[308:30.89]Mr. Sheriff.
[308:31.63]I don't want to accidentally shoot Mr. Sheriff.
[308:36.35]Oh, God.
[308:38.89]I was about to fucking die right there.
[308:42.69]That would have been so horrible.
[308:43.73]I would have been so angry.
[308:44.53]We did it.
[309:02.65]Watch, they're gonna be like a hundred people out here.
[309:04.21]Oh, God.
[309:04.51]What?
[309:35.82]I have to go do some negotiating?
[309:39.04]Oh no.
[309:46.44]Okay, here we go.
[309:47.42]We're on it again.
[309:48.42]Let's get all these red shirts.
[309:54.24]Oh, that was a horse.
[309:56.12]Sorry, horse.
[310:04.00]This is fucking ridiculous.
[310:05.28]I don't even know what I'm shooting at anymore.
[310:09.34]Too many innocent horses.
[310:17.45]This is overheat.
[310:18.17]I'm afraid to hold down with that one.
[310:29.78]Horses buggy.
[310:30.58]We can blow it up.
[310:34.11]You guys got one too.
[310:38.39]How come it took us so long to get a machine gun and they have one too?
[310:46.38]Why do they have to send like three of these?
[310:53.94]Alright.
[311:00.19]Bill ain't here.
[311:01.42]We looked everywhere.
[311:02.50]Hold on!
[311:03.02]Hold on, I've missed it.
[311:05.56]Mr. Marston, we got a live one.
[311:08.28]He says Bill's already run off to Mexico yesterday morning.
[311:12.54]You'll never get him.
[311:14.82]Javier Escuela.
[311:17.00]He's gone to see Javier Escuela.
[311:18.86]New map.
[311:20.00]That should make things interesting.
[311:22.18]Where in Mexico?
[311:24.38]How should I know?
[311:27.56]Where in Mexico, you little shit?
[311:31.95]Let's go down the river.
[311:32.68]We're going to go down past Lake Winnipesaukee, wherever we're going.
[311:36.24]Take the ferry.
[311:37.12]Okay.
[312:01.98]I'm sorry about this, John.
[312:03.30]I guess you'll be heading to Mexico?
[312:05.61]So it would seem.
[312:09.35]How is it down there?
[312:10.93]Wonderful.
[312:11.73]A sweet, peace-loving people with a love of social justice.
[312:16.59]It's an 18 plus stream in Mexico, really?
[312:22.43]We gotta go to Ireland next.
[312:27.75]After Mexico, you get on a plane, you go to Ireland.
[312:30.25]The Wright brothers who take off on the first fucking plane.
[312:41.44]Sweet, peace-loving people.
[312:50.50]Alright.
[312:53.00]50 bucks and an achievement.
[312:58.44]There's new weapons.
[312:59.70]I want to see what the new weapons are.
[313:00.84]A lot of bodies out here.
[313:10.47]What's the new weapon?
[313:21.49]Come on.
[313:21.87]I'm not that far away.
[313:22.73]Come on.
[313:26.80]Can I do it here?
[313:27.34]Here we go.
[313:33.34]The weapons are in Mexico now.
[313:35.36]Okay.
[313:41.22]Let's just go to Armadillo or something.
[313:44.94]Just save it.
[313:52.52]And then I have to get out of this room.
[313:55.74]It's gonna be one of those scenarios where I'm gonna open this door and it's gonna be like... It's gonna like flow up.
[314:04.35]Fucking hot air is gonna flow out of this room when I open the door.
[314:13.80]I don't hate Xbox.
[314:14.84]I don't hate the Wii.
[314:16.08]I love them all.
[314:16.64]They're all great companies except Microsoft sucks.
[314:22.55]Fucking Windows 10.
[314:23.74]Like, come on.
[314:24.16]What is that shit?
[314:25.02]Windows 8 wasn't good enough?
[314:26.06]You had to skip 9?
[314:28.04]Why are there so many people over here?
[314:29.80]I want that guy.
[314:42.45]I want this guy.
[314:43.77]He's mine.
[314:44.27]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[314:45.49]I want him.
[315:00.95]There they go.
[315:04.24]Can I steal him back?
[315:05.06]I wonder if I can, like, take him back.
[315:13.36]Alright, I got you.
[315:20.54]Come with me.
[315:21.76]I'll take you back home.
[315:22.56]Alright, I'm fucking out of here.
[315:30.92]I think he's dead.
[315:31.68]No, they let him go.
[315:33.02]They dragged him out of the town to let him go.
[315:34.48]Uh... I just have to do this again.
[315:43.54]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[315:49.73]I'm just gonna save it and be done.
[315:52.73]And...
[315:54.48]I probably will play this on Thursday.
[315:57.70]I'm not sure.
[315:59.10]There's a very strong possibility that we'll continue this on Thursday and go to Mexico.
[316:06.31]It just is too hot in this room to be in here anymore.
[316:10.05]I've been in this room for almost six hours now.
[316:12.67]Just about five and a half, six hours.
[316:15.83]It is not good.
[316:17.69]I gotta get out of here.
[316:22.48]I'm getting close to the end.
[316:23.44]Uh, we'll see.
[316:29.84]We shall see.
[316:30.56]Thank you for sticking around.
[316:32.15]Thank you for, uh, dealing with my rage.
[316:35.55]I wasn't even mad at the game.
[316:36.99]That's the thing.
[316:37.43]Like, I'm, like, Red Dead Redemption is fucking awesome.
[316:39.75]This game is fucking awesome.
[316:41.63]I was, like, angry at, like, the placement of the buttons on the Xbox controller.
[316:47.19]That should be universal.
[316:49.52]Universal fucking buttons.
[316:50.64]Can we get behind that as gamers?
[316:53.20]Can we get universal buttons?
[316:55.76]It should just be fucking universal.
[316:57.70]Give the patents to each other and just make the same fucking buttons.
[317:04.43]Should have been like that from the very beginning.
[317:05.67]Did a political argument ignite in chat?
[317:14.35]Come on.
[317:14.89]Gamers unite.
[317:18.55]Change.org.
[317:19.79]Give us all the same face buttons.
[317:22.41]Give us all the same fucking face buttons so Jerma can do the don't hit your fucking finger with a knife minigame.
[317:30.70]Let's start a movement.
[317:34.90]And Universal Games, too.
[317:37.84]If it comes out on fucking Xbox, it comes out on PS4 and, well, obviously there's exclusives, right?
[317:43.95]Exclusives are okay.
[317:46.13]As long as they're, you know, done right.
[317:48.79]Because, I mean, oh, there's got to be a reason.
[317:50.47]You know, just have one system.
[317:52.72]The fucking Game Station.
[317:56.56]Then make the Game Station.
[317:58.02]Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.
[317:59.78]All of you, just pool your resources and make the Game Station.
[318:01.98]Split it 33, 33, 33.
[318:04.59]And then donate like the other 1% goes to like charity.
[318:07.43]Make the fucking game station.
[318:12.55]And have the same fucking controller with the same buttons on it.
[318:25.80]Seize the means of game production.
[318:30.18]PC, am I right?
[318:31.44]I'm fucking kidding.
[318:32.38]It's just a joke.
[318:33.12]I'm all for competition.
[318:37.04]It's a joke.
[318:39.12]It could technically just be a cartel.
[318:40.58]The Game Station.
[318:41.54]The Game Sphere.
[318:48.99]You'd still be bad on the Game Station.
[318:52.66]Well, there's no way for you to know that.
[318:54.66]Because it doesn't exist.
[318:59.01]Alright, guys.
[319:00.58]In all seriousness, all jokes aside, thank you for watching.
[319:06.50]As always, much appreciated.
[319:07.94]Everybody that subbed, everybody that gave bits, everybody that hung out for the five and some change hours or so.
[319:17.31]Much love.
[319:18.11]We'll see you guys on Thursday.
[319:18.90]We'll go to Mexico.
[319:22.12]And I have a lot of PSVR to do, by the way.
[319:25.84]So there is at least seven or eight PSVR games that I want to play.
[319:29.42]And that's what's going to happen next.
[319:31.44]So we'll try to do some more Red Dead.
[319:33.00]We'll see how far we get.
[319:35.02]And then we have plenty of PSVR to do.
[319:38.18]Which should be fun.
[319:40.12]Good night.
[319:40.73]Good luck.
[319:42.09]See you guys on Thursday.
[319:43.13]Much love.
[320:06.33]Oh geez, I'm about to end the stream and... Hold on.
[320:09.87]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $5 right now.
[320:13.43]Missed most of tonight's stream.
[320:14.47]Just wanted to say that I'm glad you're enjoying the game.
[320:16.40]It's probably one of my favorite game worlds.
[320:19.14]Also, would you consider playing L.A.
[320:20.30]Noire on stream?
[320:21.16]It's another great one and it'd be hilarious to see you play it.
[320:23.18]Ow!
[320:24.18]Sorry.
[320:25.56]Uh, yeah.
[320:27.88]Thanks for the five bucks, Moo, and I'm having a great time.
[320:30.94]I think the game is very fun.
[320:31.82]There's a lot to do.
[320:33.39]It's keeping my interest.
[320:35.17]And hopefully it's fun to watch.
[320:36.41]Because I'm going to keep playing it.
[320:38.65]But I don't know about L.A.
[320:39.41]Noire.
[320:39.65]Maybe.
[320:41.45]It depends.
[320:42.15]L.A.
[320:42.75]Noire is a very, very slow game.
[320:44.29]Is it not?
[320:45.38]It probably won't hold my attention on stream.
[320:49.86]I feel like that's something I would play, just sitting, like, eating popcorn in my living room, like, going to bed.
[320:54.26]But, maybe.
[320:56.04]I've not ruled it out.
[320:57.64]But, goodnight.
[320:58.89]See you guys later.
[321:00.27]Happy Thursday.
[321:02.19]Happy Tuesday.
[321:02.69]I mean, happy Thursday when we see you again on Thursday.
