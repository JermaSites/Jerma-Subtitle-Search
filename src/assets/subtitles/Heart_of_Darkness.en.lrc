[01:13.96]Hey, what's up?
[01:17.72]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[01:19.18]Jerma here with a video game in a video game.
[01:23.10]That's right.
[01:24.52]There's a video game inside this video game.
[01:28.27]And you press A, and then you press B, and then you press E. SEGA Genesis.
[01:35.75]Hey.
[01:38.03]Original intro.
[01:41.05]And I've got somebody else sitting right here next to me.
[01:44.60]Say hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48.06]He's not here.
[01:48.80]Just kidding.
[01:49.46]He's not here yet.
[01:52.44]Hey, it's me, Etalyx.
[01:53.60]How are you?
[01:54.26]Hey!
[01:55.78]There he is.
[01:57.98]Hey, guys.
[01:58.42]How are you?
[01:58.82]It's me, Etalyx.
[02:00.50]I can't really do his voice.
[02:01.80]Sorry.
[02:07.85]He will be here tonight.
[02:10.02]So this stream, just hold on.
[02:13.32]Let me just make a Twitter to everybody and just say, hey, what's up, Twitter?
[02:17.24]I almost just made my twitch.tv Twitter.
[02:18.98]That's not right.
[02:21.52]Give me one sec.
[02:22.00]I'll be here in a second.
[02:22.66]Hold on, hold on.
[02:23.28]We're early.
[02:23.74]We're like five minutes early.
[02:24.54]Just give me a second.
[02:55.63]Alright.
[02:56.93]So, no, he's not gonna show up midstream.
[02:59.30]I have to go get him.
[03:01.70]I have to go get him at the airport.
[03:05.00]So.
[03:06.32]The stream is only gonna be, like, two or three hours long.
[03:10.40]Something like that.
[03:11.81]Because I have to go get him.
[03:13.19]And if the stream keeps going, then I can't go get him at the airport.
[03:17.03]What if I just kept streaming?
[03:18.91]He's just sitting there waiting to get picked up.
[03:20.51]I'm like, yeah, hold on a minute, dude.
[03:21.57]I'll be there in, like, three hours.
[03:27.57]Airport IRL stream.
[03:29.31]No, I ain't doing that.
[03:32.82]Tell him to get an Uber.
[03:34.26]That's like so rude.
[03:35.62]I can't do that.
[03:37.58]Hey dude, just get an Uber.
[03:38.62]I don't give a fuck.
[03:39.54]It's the first time you've ever been to like the East Coast.
[03:42.95]Go get a fucking Uber or something.
[03:44.41]I don't give a shit.
[03:47.69]I'm not gonna do that to him.
[03:54.12]Do a Logan Airport stream.
[03:55.90]Am I even allowed?
[03:57.34]Can you even do that?
[03:59.84]Are you even legally allowed to live stream an airport?
[04:02.82]Are you?
[04:03.60]You are, right?
[04:04.48]You can't live stream a bus stop?
[04:06.59]What's the difference?
[04:10.87]That stream will be like 150k.
[04:14.27]You won't be able to see anything.
[04:17.17]I'm gonna get charged like 500 bucks for like a 200k upstream.
[04:27.10]Well, we'll cross that bridge if we need to, but I don't even know how to stream from my phone.
[04:30.86]I have no idea how to even do that.
[04:37.64]Can you even stream from a phone?
[04:39.46]Or do I need, like, a weird GoPro set up to, like, a... One of those external Wi-Fi things.
[04:46.34]How do the IRL streamers do it?
[04:47.46]Do they stream from their actual cell phone?
[04:53.24]This game is a nightmare?
[04:54.02]This game is a nightmare.
[04:57.34]Yes, you can stream.
[04:57.94]Yeah, but don't you need to plug your phone into like an LTE converter so you get like plus 50,000 kilobytes up or something?
[05:06.28]I always see these IRL streamers and they have like a fucking proton pack.
[05:10.39]They have their iPhone and then it's connected to like a bunch of devices and shit.
[05:24.39]IRL get it now.
[05:28.06]Just take a picture of yourself every 10 seconds and then upload it.
[05:31.60]That's actually a funnier idea.
[05:33.96]Is just every, like, every two minutes just put another picture on Twitter of us, like, talking.
[05:46.23]Every, like, five minutes upload a one minute video to Twitter.
[05:52.72]Anyways, hi guys.
[05:53.48]Sorry there was no stream yesterday.
[05:55.48]I just wanted to clean the house and shit.
[05:57.86]I just wasn't around.
[06:00.60]Let me tell you something.
[06:03.94]Every year, Christmas gets pulled back.
[06:07.85]Christmas season gets pulled back another week.
[06:10.77]Every single year.
[06:13.39]It used to be.
[06:14.71]It used to be.
[06:15.49]Let's get this off the screen.
[06:18.75]So, it used to be
[06:22.04]That once, once Christmas, the week before Christmas, or like two weeks before Christmas, is when everybody did all their shopping, it was okay, well Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving, and everybody doesn't give a shit anymore.
[06:35.35]Black Friday happens, and then like three weeks go by, and then it's Christmas.
[06:39.02]Now, dude, it's Christmas season, quit game, I'm not gonna quit game, what are you talking about?
[06:46.27]I haven't even talked about the thing I want to talk about yet.
[06:47.93]Hold on.
[06:49.51]So, Christmas is being pulled back a week every single year.
[06:53.97]First it was like after Black Friday, now it's like a week before Black Friday, now it's like two weeks before Black Friday.
[06:59.51]I saw that fucking fat fuck Santa Claus asshole drinking a Coca-Cola on the side of a truck back in October.
[07:06.67]So, I mean, what is going on here?
[07:09.95]Everybody wants to do a bunch of Christmas shit.
[07:12.47]The turkey's still fucking warm.
[07:14.69]I'm still eating turkey sandwiches, and we're talking about playing The Grinch.
[07:18.53]I was talking about playing The Grinch tonight.
[07:20.59]No, fuck you, Jeremy.
[07:22.03]You wait a week.
[07:23.17]Until it's, like, December, like, 12th.
[07:24.53]You know what I mean?
[07:28.18]Anyways.
[07:30.68]Halloween.
[07:32.18]Yeah, the day after Halloween, all that candy, it just gets converted into Christmas candy.
[07:43.16]Anyways, hi.
[07:44.92]This is Heart of Darkness.
[07:46.42]Where I'm getting at with this is... So for... This stream is only going to be like a couple hours long.
[07:54.44]Tomorrow and the next day, the next couple of streams is going to be real life Etalyx here.
[07:59.79]So we're going to do a bunch of shit.
[08:02.21]We're going to play a bunch of co-op games that are local only that we haven't had a chance to play.
[08:06.89]Think about all those local only games that...
[08:10.79]you could have played, or that you've wanted to play with somebody, and you just can't because they're across the fucking world.
[08:16.70]Well, there'll be a lot of that over the next few days, for sure.
[08:23.17]So, okey-dokey.
[08:25.72]But for now, we're gonna play one of my favorite old games of all time, this is Heart of Darkness.
[08:30.14]We're gonna use the keyboard, because I didn't- I can't use my- my controller's like, fucked up.
[08:34.66]It won't work with this game or something, so we're gonna play some new game.
[08:37.18]Hope you are ready, hope you had a fantastic day, and hello, ladies and gentlemen, new game!
[08:43.57]This game costed like- like 500 million dollars to make, by the way.
[08:47.25]This is- this is an old, uh, tantrum game.
[08:51.55]Interplay.
[08:56.79]As you can see, it already is hanging.
[09:00.31]It's already having problems in this cutscene.
[09:05.35]This game's also, like, impossible.
[09:08.51]But I'll be quiet.
[09:16.02]This is gonna be a lag stream.
[09:19.90]By the way, Amazing Studio sounds like a porn company.
[09:23.50]It just does.
[09:32.69]Can you tell this is a LucasArts game?
[09:35.43]No, it's not.
[09:37.73]But you thought it was for a minute, didn't you?
[09:45.98]Impossible for children?
[09:46.94]No, this game is actually fucking impossible.
[09:50.10]It's not easy.
[09:51.08]It's too hard.
[10:02.74]Look, there's the planets.
[10:05.62]Did you guys know that in the rings of Saturn, those are all planets?
[10:09.10]The rings of Saturn have, like, 600 billion planets in the rings.
[10:12.16]That's what it looks... It's kind of like, you know, Minecraft?
[10:14.90]When somebody makes, like, a cool Minecraft image, you have to pull way out to see.
[10:18.33]Those are all individual blocks.
[10:22.07]There it goes.
[10:23.99]Fascinating.
[10:24.97]Perhaps even terrifying.
[10:36.73]sleeping in my class in broad daylight.
[10:40.39]Well, let's see if you're more alert in the dark.
[10:43.01]You can spend the rest of the hour in the cupboard.
[10:45.56]You can't shut me up in there.
[10:47.44]I know my rights.
[10:48.14]I'm just a lawyer.
[10:49.32]And mine's a judge.
[10:51.06]Oh, and mine's a judge.
[10:52.84]Afraid of the dark?
[10:58.26]Come back here this minute, young man.
[10:59.48]That's like headbutting in a crotch.
[11:02.75]There's an eclipse of the sun today.
[11:04.53]There'll be a test about it tomorrow.
[11:07.97]Wait, what was going on with the clock there?
[11:15.89]3D movie maker.
[11:21.14]I don't even know how to play the game on PC, I don't think.
[11:24.74]This game was on PlayStation 1.
[11:26.44]Alright, I've never like fucking paid attention to that scene.
[11:36.23]That was fucking horrible.
[11:39.15]That could have been somebody dying on camera.
[11:47.06]This game sucks?
[11:47.78]No, this game does not suck.
[11:48.88]This game is actually really cool.
[11:51.28]I promise you.
[11:51.80]Just wait until after the dumb cutscene is over.
[11:56.24]Oh, by the way, um, by the way, the end of this game, uh, you wake up from a dream.
[12:00.58]The whole thing is a dream.
[12:01.34]This game's fucking stupid.
[12:03.12]Like, spoiler, sorry, I don't care.
[12:04.40]Like, it's dumb.
[12:05.26]You wake up from a nightmare.
[12:06.42]That's, the whole game is just, is like a dream.
[12:08.21]You're in bed the whole time.
[12:09.91]Cool.
[12:11.51]Sorry.
[12:16.39]It really is, it really is that stupid trope of like, oh, babe, wake up, it's all just a dream.
[12:20.58]No, it is.
[12:20.98]Everything is just a dream.
[12:21.84]This whole thing is a dream.
[12:22.78]Nothing matters.
[12:23.92]You wake up in bed.
[12:24.66]It's stupid.
[12:37.69]Might as well skip the cutscene then.
[12:40.05]No.
[12:45.06]Have I played the game that this is a spiritual successor to?
[12:47.38]I have not.
[12:48.48]I don't think so.
[12:54.40]I spoiled the game at the start of the stream.
[12:56.10]Do you actually care about that?
[12:59.06]None of you care about that.
[13:02.07]If you cared about this game and the knowledge this game has, and the story, you would have played this game 20 years ago when it came out.
[13:08.95]And you know, you would have played it like 10 years ago when they remade it.
[13:12.18]Well, they didn't remake it, they just put it somewhere where you could actually get it to run on computers or something.
[13:16.56]You would have played the game like 5 years ago when I made the video about this game, if you've been a channel watcher for that long.
[13:23.05]So, you've had plenty of opportunities.
[13:31.74]Andy.
[13:33.76]Buddy, buddy boy.
[13:34.90]Buddy by us.
[13:40.90]Jeremy doesn't care about it.
[13:41.94]What do you mean I don't care about my fans?
[13:43.38]What are you talking about?
[13:47.92]Calling you up?
[13:48.68]What?
[13:51.32]I saw a knife.
[13:54.83]Pack apple.
[13:56.73]Camera.
[13:58.73]Knife.
[14:05.18]You guys don't understand.
[14:07.06]This game gets really... This is not what... This game is not what you think it is.
[14:11.26]Trust me when I say that.
[14:12.08]I tell you, this game took a lot of money to make.
[14:17.96]This is not... This is 20 years ago cutscene.
[14:20.96]This was across probably 16 discs.
[14:36.02]You don't know how the game plays?
[14:40.17]Well, you'll see in a minute.
[14:41.31]It's fucking impossible.
[14:44.23]But it's cool, it's hard, and it's really interesting.
[14:49.85]Don't ever take your eyes off the road, kid.
[14:56.49]You don't even know that.
[14:57.25]It didn't even go to driver's ed yet.
[15:03.79]It's a good 12 FPS.
[15:05.15]He should be dead.
[15:20.80]And there it is.
[15:22.18]Hey!
[15:26.52]Out of this wor- Oh, another world!
[15:27.72]Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[15:30.04]Another world is also fucking impossible.
[15:34.44]Out of this world is impossible.
[15:36.48]It's not possible.
[15:37.84]Here we go.
[15:38.84]So, how the game works, if you don't know, it's a side-scrolling shooter, where eventually, when I get out of this vehicle, you don't get any tutorials, the game doesn't tell you anything, you just have to go and play.
[15:52.27]And that's it.
[15:54.41]So I'm kind of stuck here right now.
[15:55.75]I've played this game before, although I don't know how it works on the keyboard.
[15:59.77]I need to know what the controls are.
[16:01.39]It's probably like A and like D or something.
[16:04.37]Let's see.
[16:05.43]X, V. Okay, well that's a... Fucking beautiful.
[16:09.55]Like, the backgrounds of this game are absolutely stunning.
[16:13.29]And I need to, like... I gotta figure out the controls.
[16:16.69]No.
[16:17.09]Yes.
[16:17.61]No.
[16:18.89]No.
[16:19.49]Shit.
[16:19.75]I don't know how to save.
[16:22.39]A, S. There it is.
[16:26.33]Alright, so it's... D is shoot.
[16:29.94]So what is run?
[16:30.38]Run.
[16:33.92]This game is awesome.
[16:35.62]If you don't care about losing over and over again.
[16:38.66]What was jump?
[16:39.58]What was jump?
[16:40.14]Space?
[16:41.04]Space is also shoot.
[16:44.22]What was it?
[16:45.04]No.
[16:45.42]Okay, it's J. J is jump.
[16:47.36]Oh boy, this is bad.
[16:48.96]D is shoot.
[16:50.04]Space is shoot.
[16:50.86]J is jump.
[16:52.18]What a sprint.
[17:02.53]Okay, it's not J. What the fuck is jump?
[17:08.69]What the fuck is going on here?
[17:10.55]It's G. Okay, G is jump.
[17:15.79]D and G. Alright, so you see the... If you notice here, now monsters show up and I got kicked off because of that.
[17:31.71]There is a sprint.
[17:32.45]I just don't know what it is.
[17:33.13]I'm gonna have to go to the menu.
[17:37.39]Shadows hurt you in this game.
[17:38.69]They're bad.
[17:42.38]Everything is a one-hit kill.
[17:43.96]Everything, as you see here.
[17:46.20]Not a one-hit kill, but pretty close.
[17:51.34]What is sprint?
[17:52.14]So I can please, like... That's jump.
[17:53.96]What is sprint?
[17:55.89]F?
[17:56.03]Okay, F is sprint.
[17:56.83]Got it.
[17:58.09]So it's F, G, and D. You got it.
[18:08.63]Yeah, it's one of these games.
[18:10.03]Oh fuck, I forgot about this part.
[18:15.26]I forgot about this part!
[18:16.00]This part of the game's hard!
[18:17.30]I'm dead.
[18:23.49]Uh, yeah, I just got eaten.
[18:28.69]You gotta keep the death counter going, because there's gonna be a thousand deaths.
[18:40.15]This game is not easy.
[18:43.01]It's all trial and error.
[18:44.39]You have to, like, guess what's going to happen next on the next screen.
[18:49.08]It's not easy.
[18:49.84]Alright, we're good.
[18:53.68]I think that's all clear.
[18:55.44]Yeah, okay.
[18:55.88]Go, go, go, go.
[18:56.64]Oh, shit.
[18:58.56]Get out of the way.
[18:59.07]Get out of the way.
[18:59.55]Get out of the way.
[19:00.01]Get out of the way.
[19:00.47]Get out of the way.
[19:00.91]Get out of the way.
[19:03.09]Oh, god damn it.
[19:07.10]See how, like, every fucking checkpoint is five seconds away?
[19:13.26]Get off me, fucking alien!
[19:18.47]They're like monkeys, but they're not monkeys.
[19:23.45]Yeah, get out the deaths, go ahead!
[19:24.85]You can rack them up, because it's gonna happen.
[19:29.93]Get the fuck off me!
[19:43.65]I need to tell you, it's so horrible trying to press D, F, and G to control a video game.
[19:50.38]I need to go get my controller to make sure it works.
[19:58.91]Almost.
[20:02.77]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[20:04.39]No, the flying ones, flying monkeys.
[20:10.90]Alright, time to run.
[20:11.92]Run!
[20:13.88]Shit!
[20:19.94]Get out of here, please!
[20:28.78]Wanna talk about a fucking hard game, guys?
[20:31.14]I got one for you here.
[20:33.33]Oh, fuck.
[20:38.61]And this is not even the very beginning of the game.
[20:47.55]Oh.
[20:49.14]Oh, shi- It's alright, it saves at every screen.
[20:56.10]Just shoot.
[20:57.10]Shoot, please shoot.
[21:01.79]Shoot the fucking gun!
[21:03.07]Oh my god, I... Huh?
[21:12.02]Oh.
[21:13.42]Thanks, Luigi.
[21:15.60]There is a double jump.
[21:16.52]I have to get a controller plugged in.
[21:17.84]I have to.
[21:20.02]Yeah, there is no fucking way in a hundred million years that I'm going to be able to play this game with the arrow keys and DFG.
[21:28.93]Not in a fucking million years.
[21:31.43]So, hold on a second.
[21:35.10]Like, you're talking about, like, 25-year-old, like, cereal box game.
[21:39.70]That's, like, that's what we're dealing with there.
[21:41.62]Alright, let's see.
[21:45.33]Let's see if this will work.
[21:50.39]I tried this controller.
[21:51.35]This controller didn't work.
[21:52.07]Maybe this one will.
[21:56.14]What is this plugged into?
[21:58.08]Nothing?
[21:58.34]Alright, get out of here.
[22:02.31]Let's see if I can get this to do this.
[22:03.91]I'll be happy if this works.
[22:06.07]Three keys?
[22:06.71]No, nobody plays video games with that shit.
[22:09.35]Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[22:12.68]Ready?
[22:15.92]Controls.
[22:19.54]There it is.
[22:20.66]Right.
[22:23.89]Run 1 and 5.
[22:24.49]No, I'm gonna have to...
[22:32.05]I don't think it's possible.
[22:35.71]No, let me try this.
[22:36.95]Let me try, like, closing the game.
[22:39.78]Because, like, this needs to be, like, it's plugged in.
[22:41.54]Hey, there's a controller here.
[22:44.68]Right?
[22:44.86]Okay.
[22:47.12]I guess.
[22:49.64]Reset.
[22:50.10]No, I'm not going to reset the game.
[22:53.43]Let's open that back up.
[22:56.03]See if that did anything.
[23:00.24]Go back to keyboard.
[23:01.84]Let me try... Well, maybe the game... Because, look, when games are open sometimes, they don't... They, like, don't get it.
[23:10.38]Yes!
[23:13.45]Yes!
[23:13.87]I was so disappointed.
[23:15.61]We got it, boys and girls.
[23:17.23]We're ready to go.
[23:19.53]I got the controller in my hand right now.
[23:26.05]Oh my goodness, that's so much better.
[23:27.91]Wait, what is jump?
[23:30.23]Alright, that's jump.
[23:32.69]Hold on, which one of these?
[23:34.45]I gotta rebind this.
[23:35.80]No, I don't.
[23:36.24]Fuck it.
[23:36.54]Let's go.
[23:39.16]What's sprint?
[23:43.48]Okay, that's sprint.
[23:46.84]Oh god damn it.
[23:48.16]This game is a hard game.
[23:49.61]This is not a game for children, guys.
[23:59.17]I'm about to sprint by it.
[24:01.37]God damn it.
[24:02.74]Good luck counting the deaths here.
[24:10.08]There it is.
[24:15.10]Fuck.
[24:15.70]Fuck.
[24:16.78]Climb it.
[24:20.81]Harder than Cuphead.
[24:21.51]This is like what Cuphead was inspired by.
[24:23.61]God damn it.
[24:24.29]I have to do this every time.
[24:26.77]I forgot you have to do this every goddamn time.
[24:28.71]You gotta time it perfectly.
[24:34.13]Go!
[24:36.96]God damn it, it's not angled correctly!
[24:39.56]No!
[24:40.16]Shit!
[24:47.00]So yeah, you can see how this is from the guy that made Another World.
[24:56.65]Die!
[24:58.11]Oh my god, die!
[24:59.16]Ah, fuck!
[25:04.50]Alright, everyone's down here.
[25:09.76]I gotta get this guy.
[25:10.48]I have to jump when he does that, when he smashes.
[25:13.56]Nope.
[25:13.86]Okay, try it again.
[25:16.79]Got it.
[25:18.51]Get me up there.
[25:18.97]Come on.
[25:19.33]Go.
[25:20.25]Go, go, go.
[25:20.69]I hear them coming.
[25:21.17]I hear them coming.
[25:21.59]I hear them coming.
[25:21.97]They're coming.
[25:22.29]They're coming.
[25:26.74]See you later.
[25:36.20]He ate all my shit.
[25:37.00]One of the bad endings is coming up here.
[26:00.61]I can get the bat in.
[26:01.37]I have to run by, I think.
[26:05.95]I forget what you have to do here.
[26:09.02]Yep, just run.
[26:11.44]I have no proton pack anymore.
[26:13.72]I do have this creepy Jim Carrey mask character behind me.
[26:23.65]Right into the light.
[26:24.37]I know how I knew that because I've done it before That's right ladies and gentlemen Sometimes all it takes is just knowing what to do because you've done it already Now we climb Just take a look at the backgrounds though the game the game itself is very beautiful Cheater this is one of my favorite games ever If it's not possible to play with a keyboard that's for sure
[27:02.80]Okay, well, I overshot that by just a little.
[27:07.26]Somebody just write so beautiful dot dot dot.
[27:12.44]Come on, man.
[27:13.22]I'm fine.
[27:17.41]This game was, like, hand-crafted.
[27:19.53]There's nothing... What a beautiful game this is.
[27:29.12]I'm just going to climb down slowly.
[27:31.80]Alright, now I'm going to climb up a little bit here.
[27:33.48]And jump across.
[27:36.45]I think.
[27:37.63]Yes.
[27:42.01]This was in my video?
[27:42.91]Yeah, it was.
[27:43.49]This was in my video.
[27:47.23]Watch how cool this is.
[27:55.70]Pretty cool.
[27:57.09]Alright!
[27:57.69]I just got a hundred bucks!
[27:59.28]Who gave me a hundred dollars?
[28:01.44]Oh, wow.
[28:02.68]Thanks!
[28:04.14]DB, DB, DB!
[28:05.40]Thanks for the hundred bucks!
[28:13.36]Alright, this is more like the puzzle.
[28:17.36]This is a puzzle game as well as an adventure action game.
[28:22.56]I have to grab something here.
[28:24.12]Can I climb this?
[28:25.04]It's been a long time.
[28:27.78]Yeah, there we go.
[28:29.58]I can talk into that.
[28:35.03]What do you mean that wasn't cool?
[28:36.29]This game is very cool.
[28:39.83]For what it is and how long ago it was made.
[28:44.88]See, there's cutscenes in the middle of your game.
[28:46.88]Here comes another cutscene.
[28:57.47]I remember this guy.
[28:58.21]The guy with the boogers.
[28:59.07]This guy's boogers hanging out of his nose like crazy.
[29:04.55]This character is disgusting.
[29:09.17]Take that, Saturn and N64.
[29:26.55]What's that supposed to mean?
[29:29.18]Oh, no.
[29:31.76]Oh, come on.
[29:33.36]Thank God.
[29:33.74]Don't.
[29:34.10]Don't.
[29:34.54]This is like Elmo's shaved creepy cousin.
[29:55.18]Now what have you got in the sack?
[29:57.52]I hope for your sake it's yours, boy.
[29:59.96]You promised me.
[30:01.18]Bring me the sack, you kid.
[30:03.50]I couldn't walk by myself, really.
[30:04.91]No more dumb signies here.
[30:09.33]Oh, goody.
[30:12.67]This is going to be such fun.
[30:14.91]Open it.
[30:19.78]It's just a dog.
[30:21.02]Did somebody spike my drink?
[30:25.44]No.
[30:26.98]Please, master.
[30:27.80]Maybe it's the boy in disguise.
[30:29.66]Then let the water get to him.
[30:34.57]Always change faster, the boys in your kingdom.
[30:40.03]Peck him.
[30:43.78]That's my favorite character.
[30:46.10]Master, the boy's in your kingdom.
[30:50.03]Get him, then.
[30:52.29]You imbeciles.
[30:54.15]Can we talk about something for a minute?
[30:57.89]Okay, the evilest, most mastermindical geniuses always seem to have imbeciles as all their employees and all of their henchmen.
[31:10.63]Maybe you shouldn't have hired a bunch of fucking idiots.
[31:13.75]Think about that.
[31:14.19]Think of every major villain that's ever appeared in any form of media.
[31:18.08]They're always surrounded by fucking idiots.
[31:22.92]You're supposed to be a genius, yet you surround yourself with fucking 14 IQ idiots.
[31:31.69]Maybe that says something about you, not about the people that you've hired.
[31:33.99]Trying to like save money or something?
[31:36.53]I don't get it.
[31:36.93]Where's like all the smart henchmen?
[31:39.20]Oops-a-daisy.
[31:43.98]Only an idiot would follow a dark... Would follow a dark, evil lord.
[31:50.55]I don't know about that, man.
[31:51.53]It could be pretty lucrative.
[31:53.73]The business of evil can... pay some bills.
[31:56.49]Okay, how do I... how do I do this?
[32:02.58]Oh, he's gonna eat that.
[32:05.82]Oh, fuck.
[32:06.62]I gotta get up there.
[32:09.38]I gotta get... I gotta climb up.
[32:11.35]There, there.
[32:15.58]You don't want them to be just too smart or they won't follow orders.
[32:19.08]Yeah, but you don't want to be... Like, look, that guy... That guy mistook somebody for a dog.
[32:26.82]There's idiots and then there's fucking total morons.
[32:35.56]Nah, ain't gonna catch me.
[32:36.50]Sorry, dude.
[32:41.07]What?
[32:41.49]What?
[32:41.63]He actually got me.
[32:47.83]You gotta get to the deep water, I remember, and die when... Yep.
[32:52.85]You gotta be in deep water not to get caught.
[32:58.28]The kid kind of looks like a dog.
[32:59.28]He does not look anything like a dog.
[33:03.06]If you can't even figure that out, then you don't deserve to be in part of the evil corporation.
[33:08.45]Something as simple as, is this a person or a dog?
[33:11.21]I need a break.
[33:18.44]Climb up?
[33:18.94]Nope.
[33:21.24]I don't think I've ever beaten this game, by the way.
[33:23.84]I'm fairly certain I've never beaten this game.
[33:26.47]I keep getting to the same exact part and then being like, I don't want to do this anymore.
[33:30.45]And give it up.
[33:34.49]Grab the cloth.
[33:36.31]Whoops.
[33:39.76]How do I know the end?
[33:40.60]Because I looked it up.
[33:43.02]I went to Google.com and I went, hey, what's the end of this game?
[33:51.29]The mark of an excellent game.
[33:52.48]I need to be on this screen, I think.
[33:59.56]I can't run and jump and grab this.
[34:03.66]More of this.
[34:06.18]Oh, no!
[34:06.74]I apparently can't.
[34:09.40]I have to make that... Cheater.
[34:13.37]I have to wait until he does that and then hit the bubble, I think.
[34:21.95]He'll do a ton of drugs and it'll fuck him up big time.
[34:24.81]Can I climb?
[34:27.01]Oh, god damn.
[34:28.34]I can't.
[34:30.72]I actually think I have to do this and then climb up all the way.
[34:32.36]It would be easier if it was just a non-athletic kid.
[34:38.76]There we go.
[34:42.83]And then climb, right?
[34:43.83]I have to get up here.
[34:53.14]Whoa!
[34:53.38]Alright, come on.
[35:01.28]This is why I did this.
[35:04.00]Where are those bugs?
[35:07.90]Where are the bugs?
[35:10.38]I have to pull him down.
[35:11.38]It's been a long time.
[35:20.42]I think I have to jump way before the end here.
[35:24.42]George Lucas made this game, he may as well have.
[35:30.86]Come on, grab it and pull it!
[35:35.53]Fuck.
[35:41.51]Have I already forgotten everything?
[35:43.23]There's nowhere else to go here.
[35:46.07]I really sh- I think I sh- I need to be able to grab that.
[35:54.41]How far up can I go?
[35:55.20]Can I drop down here?
[35:56.52]Yeah, I can do this.
[35:59.46]Nope, apparently not.
[36:04.52]Shit!
[36:08.49]Quick, Google it.
[36:10.09]Google how do I do this.
[36:14.81]There we go.
[36:15.23]It was just a question of not having a... That was weird.
[36:19.07]Whatever.
[36:19.38]Alright, I got it.
[36:23.09]Hey, thank you, sticks, for the two dollars.
[36:25.87]Let's talk about Oreos.
[36:29.05]No, not about your Oreo puke fiasco.
[36:31.17]We're talking about white fudge Oreos now available for a limited time.
[36:36.29]Get yours today.
[36:36.85]This isn't sponsored.
[36:37.69]I just fucking love white fudge Oreos, okay?
[36:42.06]White fudge Oreos.
[36:45.17]I'm gonna have to do a pass on those.
[36:47.27]I'm actually not a big fan of white chocolate.
[36:50.99]White chocolate to me just kind of tastes like just sugar.
[36:53.81]Doesn't necessarily taste like chocolate to me.
[36:55.38]Okay, this is why you did this, so then the flies can come up here.
[37:04.04]But that sounds interesting.
[37:06.57]Come on, eat it.
[37:09.29]Come on.
[37:13.19]Really?
[37:15.79]Do I really have to sit here until you do this?
[37:19.90]I don't... White chocolate's not terrible.
[37:23.06]There it is.
[37:23.40]Bang.
[37:23.72]Come on.
[37:24.66]Get it.
[37:24.90]Oh, would you please eat one of these?
[37:28.80]You're making my life a living hell right now.
[37:35.67]Come on.
[37:39.36]Okay.
[37:42.30]You had an opportunity to eat one and now they're not here.
[37:52.91]I can't run by this.
[37:59.21]I can't sprint by this.
[37:59.97]It's not going to happen.
[38:02.35]Want me to try?
[38:02.79]3, 2, 1.
[38:02.85]I made it.
[38:03.13]Whoop!
[38:15.93]Is he down?
[38:16.61]He's not even down.
[38:17.30]I have to do this shit again.
[38:18.32]Well, that's annoying.
[38:23.40]You know, I remember this part right here, jumping from this to grab this thing, being one of the worst parts of the game.
[38:33.13]I remember hating this, because it just doesn't work half the time.
[38:36.29]I remember being so angry and frustrated at this one part here.
[38:39.91]Because the screen changes and the inputs don't.
[38:42.97]This is one of my favorite games ever made.
[38:46.61]So stop talking about this like you don't like it.
[38:49.54]Just hold on.
[39:05.34]Not a bad game.
[39:05.84]This game's cool.
[39:08.05]That's what we're going to reference today.
[39:10.23]Hey, thank you, BLB24 for the bits.
[39:12.25]Hey, big boy.
[39:12.91]Hey, BLB.
[39:15.85]Hold on.
[39:16.55]Did I... Yeah, the game is very pretty.
[39:25.12]This is a very, very, very top-notch video game.
[39:28.00]Back 17 years ago.
[39:29.54]It's one of my absolute favorite adventure games, just because of how crazy it is.
[39:35.22]It's...
[39:37.09]This type of stylistic video game was not really that popular back in like 1998.
[39:43.47]Yes it was.
[39:45.21]This is all that was coming out back in like 1997, 98, 99.
[39:48.53]That's the golden age of video games.
[39:51.47]What am I talking about?
[39:52.59]That is the absolute golden age for the most stylistic video games ever made.
[39:59.05]Am I drunk?
[40:07.34]Come on, eat one.
[40:09.94]Oh, you fucking stupid game.
[40:31.65]Golden years, this is the golden years from 1994 to like 2007 2008 Everything else is just awful We're in the this was like the era of cool stylized interesting video games Now we're in the cool stylized stuff you get in a box They don't even play games anymore you just open up fucking card packs
[41:02.76]Okay, what am I doing wrong here?
[41:05.56]This guy, they have to eat some, right?
[41:11.21]Can I get grabbed?
[41:14.85]No, I can't.
[41:15.49]That guy on the right has to eat one.
[41:17.79]Oh shit, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop.
[41:20.17]That guy will eat me.
[41:22.19]Can I get by the guy on the right?
[41:23.35]I don't think so.
[41:29.38]I really don't think I can.
[41:31.72]It's gonna be quick.
[41:33.32]It's gonna be quick.
[41:35.50]Made it.
[41:35.78]Okay, good.
[41:37.16]Finally.
[41:37.54]Yeah, it pushed the boat.
[41:46.11]There we go.
[41:46.65]Here we go.
[41:47.23]Time to go.
[41:47.71]Time to run.
[41:48.23]Time to fly.
[41:54.38]Hooray!
[42:00.27]This is just what it's like to ride a waterslide.
[42:03.19]There's no difference.
[42:06.63]Pour a little bit of Poland Spring down this to make it a little bit wet.
[42:19.34]And... here we are.
[42:23.03]A giant... giant snake.
[42:32.40]Fuck fuck fuck.
[42:32.98]I forgot.
[42:33.32]Yeah, he's still here.
[42:34.68]He is actually still here I'm dead.
[42:40.16]He's here to get me.
[42:41.66]Oh I'm blessed.
[42:43.34]I'm good That's what you get blob Who's ever seen Creepshow?
[42:49.01]You guys ever seen Creepshow 2?
[42:51.21]When the guy finally makes it and he's staring at the water.
[42:52.97]He's like yeah, I beat you motherfucker And the thing jumps up on the beach and lands on him That's what I'm waiting to have happen, but it's not gonna happen
[43:03.82]The raft is what that was called.
[43:12.42]No.
[43:12.98]Oops.
[43:16.03]Megamind?
[43:18.61]Spoilers.
[43:19.23]Why does everybody care so much about spoilers for games that came out... Spoilers for media that came out like fucking a decade ago.
[43:25.11]Two decades ago.
[43:32.26]This is another Elmo cousin.
[43:44.09]Thanks for the rescue.
[43:44.85]Flying Jar Jar.
[43:46.05]Creepshow was amazing.
[43:48.87]Yeah, Creepshow was crazy.
[43:51.52]Amigo!
[43:52.10]Amigo what?
[43:52.42]Amigo?
[44:03.85]Amigo, amigo.
[44:05.09]They have fireballs, that's right.
[44:19.34]This actually, I think, was a 3D glasses movie.
[44:22.98]I think it came with the packaging.
[44:25.11]I think you could actually watch this in 3D.
[44:27.35]Am I lying again?
[44:29.15]Am I making something else up?
[44:31.31]I don't think I am.
[44:39.04]This game really is just a series of you falling down into various chasms.
[44:47.50]Oh wait, I probably should get air.
[44:51.37]I just... Alright, fuck you Super Mario Brothers!
[45:01.67]That's what actually happens to you when you get hit by a fucking fireball.
[45:05.15]You know what I mean?
[45:06.61]Like, that's realistic.
[45:11.89]And Mario fucking 64, Mario 2, just like burnt your bum a little bit.
[45:16.58]No, you disintegrate.
[45:18.34]And nothing's left but your shoes.
[45:20.08]That's what actually happens to you.
[45:22.66]Oh, god damn it.
[45:29.93]Can I not move this?
[45:33.92]I can't.
[45:37.76]Little guy can hold his breath for a long time.
[45:39.88]I'm gonna get hit again.
[45:41.56]Am I gonna hit?
[45:43.04]I'm not gonna get hit again, am I?
[45:44.16]Maybe it's down here.
[45:56.13]There it is.
[45:57.37]Just touch the giant asteroid and get superpowers.
[46:05.18]Wait, that's not what I'm doing?
[46:08.17]I think I actually have superpowers now.
[46:09.76]I touched the rock.
[46:13.06]There it is.
[46:19.04]Yeah, just fireballs if you go too high.
[46:28.29]I hear more noises.
[46:33.55]Safety.
[46:37.13]And it closed right when I got up.
[46:39.98]What are the chances?
[46:41.40]Oh, that's right.
[46:42.30]Actually, I do have superpowers.
[46:44.42]I fucking forgot you actually do get this.
[46:48.02]Nice.
[46:48.28]I think I can throw a big one.
[47:00.55]Etalyx' plane landed hours ago.
[47:02.37]He's waiting for you.
[47:07.88]Oh, fuck.
[47:09.02]Whoops.
[47:11.02]Okay, I don't know why I just had a panic attack right there for one second.
[47:13.50]I, like, looked at my phone to see what time it was.
[47:15.00]I'm, like, getting nervous.
[47:17.04]So for those of you that don't know, this stream is not going to be that long.
[47:20.26]It's only going to be for probably, like, a couple hours.
[47:24.15]Because I do have to go get Etalyx at the airport.
[47:26.47]But!
[47:27.62]Don't you worry, because in the next few days, there's gonna be some real cool co-op friend streams.
[47:35.36]That should be interesting.
[47:36.12]I believe I can do this.
[47:38.50]And it turns into a real boy, yeah.
[47:44.79]I don't think this is close enough.
[47:46.53]Is it?
[47:46.73]Yeah, it is.
[47:51.07]Oh fuck, watch out for the piranhas.
[47:54.89]Well, I didn't watch out for the piranhas.
[48:01.75]But I highly, highly do recommend it.
[48:03.96]Okay, you know those top 10 games that, like, you should play?
[48:06.96]That you see on, like, those dumb list sites?
[48:11.06]Like, BuzzFeed.
[48:13.78]Top 15 classic games you need to be playing right now.
[48:19.31]Like, fuck their dumb list.
[48:20.87]You know what I mean?
[48:21.51]Their list is gonna have...
[48:24.63]It's gonna be like Ocarina of Time.
[48:27.78]Mario 64.
[48:30.36]Resident Evil 1.
[48:35.54]Like Mario 2.
[48:40.63]They'll put like Postal 2 on there to seem like interesting.
[48:44.97]It's not true.
[48:45.55]They're not.
[48:49.81]I might overshoot this.
[48:55.33]Fuck, man.
[48:55.95]Get up, quick!
[48:56.93]What if I just hit my head on the ceiling?
[49:00.68]Yeah, Skyrim will be- Skyrim.
[49:06.02]No, you wanna know what the weird games that you should play?
[49:09.06]The list of weird fucking games that you should play.
[49:12.42]This.
[49:15.16]The Neverhood.
[49:16.69]Mischief Makers for N64.
[49:18.81]That game was fucking bonkers.
[49:21.68]Uh, what else was... What else were, like, weird games?
[49:24.76]I would probably put Earthworm Jim 2 on there.
[49:32.68]Power Stone for Dreamcast.
[49:34.70]Is it... Ah, fuck.
[49:35.86]No, that was what I was supposed to do.
[49:37.30]No, it wasn't.
[49:38.90]Oh, I'm in big trouble here.
[49:40.22]No, no, I can climb on mushrooms.
[49:44.93]Power Stone?
[49:46.43]Um... No, don't put Kingdom Hearts on that list.
[49:50.96]No, no Kingdom Hearts.
[49:52.72]That's not like a weird, quirky game.
[49:55.52]Kingdom Hearts is not that game.
[49:58.88]In fact, don't ever play Kingdom Hearts, or Kingdom Hearts 2.
[50:01.50]I'm kidding, those games are like fucking great.
[50:09.44]I like love those games.
[50:13.15]I gotta watch out for these weird things that are gonna grab me.
[50:15.87]One, two, three, go.
[50:18.73]Hurry.
[50:22.57]Yeah, kingdom hearts of darkness.
[50:26.13]Let's breathe for a second.
[50:29.17]Oh, I'm going to be playing lots of Power Stone.
[50:34.06]When I do my Dreamcast collection.
[50:38.10]Fuck.
[50:39.02]Am I going down?
[50:41.84]So if you don't know, we are doing a Dreamcast collection.
[50:46.24]I'm in the process of getting dozens and dozens and dozens of Dreamcast games.
[50:52.59]We're gonna set it up, we're gonna hook it up through into capturing into the computer.
[50:56.35]And we're gonna have like a, we're gonna have like a, like the PlayStation 3, right?
[51:00.45]Where, wow, that was close.
[51:03.01]Well, I had like, you know how I had like 50 people?
[51:07.69]Well, at least I died instantly.
[51:09.91]Oh, man, that sucks.
[51:13.52]Like, at the very least, you didn't feel that, right?
[51:20.04]You were dead way before you could even know that you were dead.
[51:25.33]This one, on the other hand, I knew.
[51:26.87]I knew it was me.
[51:30.93]Simpsons Hit and Run.
[51:33.89]That's like a typical meme game.
[51:37.03]That's what's expected of me.
[51:38.57]To play that game, right?
[51:41.54]Because that's like a funny meme game.
[51:43.14]It's like Grand Theft Auto, but it's The Simpsons.
[51:45.32]But no, but you can't like... Nobody dies in The Simpsons Hit and Run.
[51:50.58]It's a Simpsons game.
[51:59.59]Why is that my, like, barometer for, like, a quality game?
[52:03.68]Now, you know what?
[52:04.14]I don't know if I like that game.
[52:04.96]Nobody dies.
[52:05.60]Like, oh, yeah.
[52:08.60]What a good, like, barometer for what a good game is.
[52:15.23]Oddworld?
[52:15.63]I don't like Oddworld.
[52:17.11]This is kind of what I... This is my Oddworld.
[52:20.49]Because this sort of is, like, Oddworld.
[52:23.49]Don't get grabbed.
[52:24.63]I know.
[52:24.87]Be careful.
[52:25.25]I gotta go up immediately right here.
[52:28.67]Right up.
[52:29.05]There we go.
[52:30.39]I don't know what's on the other screen, but hopefully it's nothing bad.
[52:35.11]What is it?
[52:37.07]That was so lucky.
[52:40.31]Did not even mean to do that.
[52:45.83]Quickly, quickly, quickly.
[52:48.11]Oh, boy.
[52:48.93]You see what I'm talking about?
[52:50.05]Everybody thinks this game is so fucking easy.
[52:53.48]Is it sucking me in or pushing me out?
[52:58.40]Look at how precise that just had to be.
[53:00.38]Are you shitting me right now, guys?
[53:03.68]Oh, God.
[53:06.38]I think this is the part of the game where I gave up.
[53:08.90]Don't!
[53:13.84]I have to commit.
[53:14.34]I already committed.
[53:15.20]Good.
[53:21.04]Oh, boy!
[53:22.04]I'm gonna die!
[53:25.17]I'm dying!
[53:26.77]Ugh.
[53:27.63]Alright.
[53:30.91]Didn't drown.
[53:32.49]Although, I think I have to be down really far here and this is going to try to push me up.
[53:36.35]Okay, I'm not sure about this one.
[53:37.51]I forget.
[53:39.17]Somebody go watch my video from like four and a half years ago.
[53:41.63]How do I do this part?
[53:47.65]Thank God it's right here.
[53:54.85]There we go.
[53:57.76]Well, that was unexpected.
[54:03.67]This next screen is gonna be so painful.
[54:07.35]I can't move.
[54:08.63]Don't move an inch when I go to the next screen.
[54:10.79]Okay.
[54:15.40]Right, not now.
[54:17.24]Right, now.
[54:22.24]Got it.
[54:24.12]Ooh, that was annoying.
[54:25.38]That was not fun.
[54:26.72]Uh-huh.
[54:34.96]This is the point I gotta climb.
[54:36.16]I think I can just jump down here.
[54:37.22]No, I cannot.
[54:39.84]I have to... I should be able to jump this.
[54:58.76]God damn it.
[54:59.46]Come on, man.
[55:02.26]Get...
[55:06.03]Get the fuck out of here.
[55:10.35]Oh, wait a minute.
[55:12.14]I have superpowers.
[55:19.02]Oh, forgot I can actually use magic.
[55:28.53]Oh, come on, grab it.
[55:40.15]Can I shoot?
[55:43.35]Okay, now I'm gonna... Okay, they shake it off.
[55:50.81]Okay, now get over there.
[55:53.18]Grab it.
[55:54.06]Grab!
[55:57.28]Come on!
[55:59.28]Shoot it down there!
[56:02.28]Shoot this guy.
[56:07.00]Okay, we're good.
[56:07.62]No, we're not good.
[56:19.46]Come on.
[56:24.24]Just drop from here.
[56:31.28]Go.
[56:32.90]Made it.
[56:35.06]Surprised at how fluid the game's animation is.
[56:38.58]Well.
[56:41.14]No, don't.
[56:41.70]Please.
[56:41.96]I was trying to shoot down.
[56:43.10]Don't start me all the way up there.
[56:44.13]I'm going to be so angry if it is.
[56:45.37]Thank god.
[56:49.07]I mean, it was made by the same guy that made Another World, right?
[56:53.77]And that game had a lot of cool animations.
[56:56.41]How old was I when I played this?
[56:59.31]I couldn't have been more... I want to say... Okay, well, they can come out there.
[57:08.74]Sort of like 15, 16.
[57:19.41]Oh, would you please?
[57:24.43]24 years old?
[57:24.97]No, that one was 24.
[57:29.99]I'm missing something here.
[57:30.75]Can I shoot the... Well, there we go.
[57:35.54]Okay, so can I knock that off now?
[57:39.56]Oh, shit.
[57:41.62]Oops.
[57:44.02]Well, I think I just... I think I made this uncompletable.
[57:55.34]There's another screen.
[57:57.08]There is another screen.
[58:05.07]It's so terrible.
[58:24.86]So I can push this.
[58:26.63]Alright, this should work now.
[58:29.05]Now I should be able to go like this.
[58:31.97]Although I kind of want to climb up there.
[58:33.31]I want to climb up there.
[58:38.47]What's up here?
[58:39.71]Anything important?
[58:45.95]Okay, we're good.
[58:48.49]No, this is just where we were before.
[58:50.23]Alright, come on.
[58:50.83]Drop down.
[58:55.79]Throw it in the water.
[58:57.57]And I can jump to it.
[59:00.28]Move it to the next screen.
[59:03.26]It should float over there.
[59:08.98]No, it doesn't.
[59:11.44]Fuck.
[59:16.30]Ah, fuck.
[59:16.96]Just kill me.
[59:17.58]I gotta go back up there.
[59:22.78]I gotta go back up there.
[59:34.72]Can I put that?
[59:35.74]Let me see.
[59:40.20]I just gave him life.
[59:41.03]No, I didn't.
[59:41.53]Alright, fine.
[59:46.09]There's literally another pod in the water.
[59:47.71]What do you mean there's another pod?
[59:48.65]I know, but I can't hit it.
[60:02.96]No, fuck you.
[60:05.63]Push it!
[60:06.07]Push it!
[60:06.47]Push it!
[60:07.11]Okay.
[60:08.29]So, can I do it from here?
[60:09.81]I guess I can go like this.
[60:13.13]And then do it from here.
[60:15.63]Get this one.
[60:18.67]No, I guess let's climb up.
[60:20.67]No?
[60:20.99]Come on.
[60:22.79]I need to go to angles so I can get this one to grow.
[60:33.93]Push boulder.
[60:36.72]Where is there a boulder?
[60:42.36]Am I actually just open?
[60:43.82]Oh god, dude.
[60:59.85]Why is everyone saying 53?
[61:09.15]53?
[61:17.22]Destroy the boulder?
[61:18.22]Oh, I can't even go down in the water.
[61:22.42]Oh, it's my death count.
[61:25.54]I'm like, why is everybody writing that?
[61:27.07]I don't understand what that means.
[61:35.17]I can't get up here.
[61:40.34]So, do I need to go up here?
[61:43.79]Up there, and then, like, cause I can't, like, go in the water without dying.
[61:47.07]Like, watch, if I, like, drop in the water, like, grab the button, no.
[62:04.35]I tried to do that before.
[62:09.92]Try to, like, shoot it up on the dirt.
[62:11.18]I mean, it's so... It's just not... I can't do that.
[62:17.86]I can't bounce it.
[62:20.06]I know I have to get it up there, but I just don't remember how.
[62:26.38]I forgot about all these guys!
[62:29.80]I'm so dead instantly when I turn the corner.
[62:31.30]No way.
[62:31.52]Apparently not.
[62:38.15]Well, that was a little bit of a glitch.
[62:50.44]I thought I came from here.
[62:51.80]You know what?
[63:01.14]Listen, here's my excuse for why I didn't do this.
[63:03.15]I thought I dropped down from here.
[63:07.20]Just, everybody relax!
[63:17.58]Are you serious?
[63:18.76]Come on!
[63:20.06]No!
[63:21.48]Come on!
[63:26.00]That is such bullshit.
[63:28.28]Fuck you, game.
[63:29.06]Oh my goodness.
[63:35.75]Of course, it was waiting for me to charge up a shot, and then it was going to instantly kill me.
[63:40.27]Of course it is.
[63:46.94]Hey, just be lucky I know this game is a frustrating mess.
[63:51.48]Because if I didn't, if I wasn't already aware of this game's frustrations, I would be like, this is the dumbest game ever made!
[63:57.60]This game sucks, you know what I mean?
[63:59.33]This game's so terrible!
[64:00.75]No, this game's fucking terrible.
[64:20.54]I distinctly remember the IGN review talking about this part of the game and being like, you know, it just didn't need to exist.
[64:26.47]They could have had a lot more cool things in the game rather than this, and... I just didn't agree with it.
[64:34.94]Just go.
[64:35.50]Just go.
[64:36.40]Why did you not go?
[64:37.68]Why did you... Why didn't you climb?
[64:39.76]Why did you crouch?
[64:41.22]Why did you crouch?
[64:42.54]You should have climbed.
[64:43.40]Why did you crouch when you should have climbed?
[64:46.11]Ugh...
[64:49.72]This game's not terrible.
[64:50.89]Yes, it is.
[64:51.27]But that doesn't mean I can't have some nostalgic moments.
[65:02.57]Game didn't need to exist.
[65:04.51]I have to kill those things.
[65:10.00]The review never said that.
[65:11.06]I've read the review.
[65:13.10]Wow.
[65:13.36]Get!
[65:13.60]Alright, we're fine.
[65:30.47]Aim in the right direction!
[65:31.99]Please!
[65:32.47]At the crack of dawn, look east?
[65:45.98]What do you mean, look east?
[65:47.60]Get... Climb... Just... Thank you for the love of God!
[65:51.78]Don't hold... You stretch-Armstrong little shit!
[65:54.70]Get off the vine!
[65:56.36]Get off the vine!
[66:14.49]I am getting like fucking so frustrated now.
[66:18.78]I wanted to show you guys like one of my favorite games when I was like a teenager.
[66:23.28]When I was your age.
[66:25.54]And right now I'm thinking like burn it!
[66:27.74]Burn this disk!
[66:39.49]I'm just gonna spam.
[66:40.37]I don't even care.
[66:52.20]Climb down.
[66:53.32]Thank you.
[66:53.74]Finally.
[66:54.14]Now, don't screw this up.
[66:57.34]I gotta climb underneath and push the boulder, but don't do that yet.
[67:02.63]Nostalgia is cruel.
[67:08.58]Fuck, I think... I have to go move the thing with the fish, but... Let me go over here first.
[67:20.27]I think I have to pull... I know what I have to do.
[67:22.35]I have to pull the boulder up.
[67:25.35]Make the fish follow me.
[67:27.27]All the way across.
[67:29.73]Get back down.
[67:31.25]Move the... Watch this.
[67:32.91]Ready?
[67:35.62]This is what you gotta do.
[67:37.02]Here they all come.
[67:38.98]I gotta move that, get up here, they're all gonna chase me, and then I have to move the thing on the seed to plant, get on the seed.
[67:48.00]So here we go.
[67:48.74]Now they know that they're, like, they're gonna be freaking out, because now they're gonna go back.
[67:53.03]See, they're going back.
[67:56.81]But, but!
[68:02.06]Huh?
[68:02.22]Huh?
[68:08.31]What?
[68:09.34]Wait, wait, wait a minute, guys.
[68:11.46]Why did that happen?
[68:13.44]Oh, that... Intelligence.
[68:18.86]Intelligence.
[68:20.20]Intelligence.
[68:21.80]Now we push this one.
[68:22.54]I got it.
[68:22.84]I already figured it out.
[68:23.52]Just don't have this guy kill me.
[68:28.91]Just be easy.
[68:29.77]You don't have to freak out or anything.
[68:30.93]Just get this in the water.
[68:32.41]And then jump to jump to jump.
[68:35.07]And we're good to go.
[68:40.53]This one's going to keep going all the way down.
[68:41.91]Just do not fuck this up.
[68:45.29]Get all the way to the top.
[68:46.11]Make it easy on yourself.
[68:48.55]And then you're down.
[68:49.43]I might have to bring this one.
[68:50.80]I have to bring this one with me.
[68:55.56]Fuck.
[68:56.26]Don't screw this up.
[68:57.20]I have to shoot this and then very gently push it.
[69:02.93]Push.
[69:06.39]We're good.
[69:08.19]Crisis averted.
[69:12.41]This is a long jump, though.
[69:14.93]You fucker!
[69:16.03]You stupid motherfucker!
[69:17.79]No!
[69:22.49]Oh, thank god!
[69:29.94]Thank god it's good.
[69:32.84]Everything's fine.
[69:33.42]I don't need to freak out.
[69:34.24]Let's do that again.
[69:40.30]Intelligent.
[69:42.99]At least the checkpoint system is fair.
[69:44.55]That's... I mean, if you had a game that was this... Where's the other one?
[69:52.72]Oh, no.
[70:06.92]Other seed.
[70:16.05]Whoops.
[70:18.61]Do it again.
[70:19.25]Alright, not this time.
[70:25.85]That was almost a fuck-up.
[70:27.13]Almost.
[70:27.67]Not quite.
[70:29.08]That would have been very close to a fuck-up, but we're good.
[70:35.70]Get all that.
[70:37.50]Now, just get a good... It's a really awkward jump, but that's what this game is.
[70:42.08]It's just awkward jumps and fun laser shooting.
[70:46.28]So I need to get it from here.
[70:52.74]Almost didn't work.
[70:59.15]That was very close to not working.
[71:00.75]All the way up.
[71:03.93]And we are finally out of this, I think.
[71:06.53]Out of this nonsense.
[71:08.89]Not quite.
[71:09.29]Okay.
[71:16.90]I'm up here.
[71:17.76]There's two on this side, I think.
[71:21.21]Looks like.
[71:21.61]Maybe there's just one.
[71:28.91]I swear to God I saw a little mouse.
[71:33.55]I guess not.
[71:34.27]Oh, Lord.
[71:34.83]Okay.
[71:35.91]And there are those little fucking aliens.
[71:37.43]There are those little... What's the kingdom hearts?
[71:40.69]Nobody's.
[71:46.35]I missed.
[71:46.83]I'm dead.
[71:47.13]At least this tracks me back here.
[71:57.46]The Heartless.
[71:58.98]They were the nobodies, you know.
[72:00.16]Oh yeah, it is the Heartless.
[72:06.72]I'm gonna play, like, one of the Kingdom Hearts songs when I fight a big group again.
[72:14.44]Ugh, just aim it in the right direction.
[72:16.07]Like, honest to God.
[72:18.91]Like, this... The fucking... Sloppy!
[72:22.81]Slippery slop!
[72:25.92]One of my favorite games as a child.
[72:27.58]This is one of them.
[72:30.90]It's such a fucking fun game.
[72:33.74]I love...
[72:35.26]Especially when there's only three planes of shooting and if you're not in the exact spot for the one of the planes It just doesn't work.
[72:42.63]Fucking favorite game as a child.
[72:45.53]I didn't even hit that guy I don't even need to fight that guy
[72:57.93]This is the other screen that we were just on before.
[73:07.66]He's fucking firing brimstone!
[73:09.86]No, time to run.
[73:12.88]You stupid asshole, you got in the way.
[73:15.36]Get...
[73:20.33]We have to climb up here.
[73:21.51]Just be easy.
[73:22.19]They're not that smart.
[73:23.67]Fucking planes of existence.
[73:25.27]Not the right plane.
[73:26.51]It had to be this exact down left.
[73:40.74]It does remind me of Oddworld, yes.
[73:48.05]Climb!
[73:49.75]We're good.
[73:56.57]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[73:58.71]Okay, so I think I have a second here.
[74:01.59]I have a second just to rain hell down from above.
[74:08.24]Sounds good to me.
[74:10.64]Just don't accidentally move to the left.
[74:17.50]Fucking plane.
[74:23.36]Fucking plane.
[74:30.08]That's it?
[74:31.38]Safe.
[74:34.28]Not safe!
[74:39.39]Oh, the disk is spinning up there.
[74:42.63]Yep.
[74:44.47]I think we're good.
[74:48.63]We're safe.
[74:49.71]Hooray.
[74:54.12]Circus?
[74:55.22]This is a really good pixel painting.

[75:49.11]Really?
[75:50.41]What time is it right now?
[75:52.01]I have no idea.
[75:54.35]I probably should, like, figure out when I have to go to the airport.
[75:57.21]Because I, like, don't even know.
[75:59.67]It's within the next, like, four hours at some point.
[76:09.59]These guys look like, um... They look like something.
[76:13.49]Not Fraggles.
[76:15.11]Maybe it is Fraggles.
[76:15.99]Yeah, it's Fraggles.
[76:22.15]Thank you, Bud Bongo.
[76:24.10]Also, Ivory, thanks for the one dollar.
[76:26.66]I'm truly surprised your Fisher-priced My First Computer can handle these graphics.
[76:31.22]PogChamp.
[76:32.52]But thank you, but seriously, thank you for streaming this nightmare of a game.
[76:40.57]Don't eat an apple?
[76:42.65]Oh wait, they don't, that's the only piece of food that's left in the world?
[76:52.04]Solved world hunger.
[76:56.85]Is that easy?
[76:59.09]Except what they don't know is that's like wicked fucked up synthetic chemicals.
[77:13.48]That was unnatural.
[77:14.72]Those things definitely are going to cause so many problems.
[77:18.88]Everyone here just got like 10,000% more radiation than they're supposed to get in a lifetime.
[77:23.24]In about five seconds.
[77:33.33]Thank you, Ben.
[77:35.04]Hello there, Ben.

[77:44.38]That's a triple thank you.
[77:46.58]For the $25, Ben.
[77:47.80]I mean, Neverhood was Claymation.
[77:51.57]Which I really should play on stream one day.
[77:53.05]That game is fan-fucking-tastic.
[77:58.93]The Neverhood is such a fantastic video game.
[78:02.58]Everybody should experience it at some point.
[78:04.44]Is it where they start smoking weed?
[78:14.93]No, it's not even weed.
[78:17.47]Is it?
[78:19.75]He's like, hey, do you want to do some drugs, kid?

[78:57.09]This kind of feels like... This is what happens to Elmo when he goes and hangs with the wrong crowd for like 20 years.
[79:06.10]His skin fizzles out and turns orange.
[79:08.58]He grows like a scraggly beard.
[79:10.28]He's addicted to fucking Muppet Crack.
[79:13.45]What do you have?
[79:29.74]Oh, there we go, I'm good.

[79:47.17]Thank you to Kale Matsuba for the two dollars.
[79:50.92]Jeremy, I've given you this 200 bits, so I can tell you that this game is made by the same guy who made Another World, and that's why it's awesome.
[79:56.48]They're both my favorite games.
[79:57.44]Also, I'm new to your stream, and I'm also already a fan.
[80:00.56]Well, thank you, Kyle.

[80:33.67]Well, I didn't make it far.

[80:49.25]More spoilers?
[80:52.18]What do you want from me?
[80:53.04]You know who cares about spoilers?
[81:00.30]Oh!
[81:02.62]Oh, boy!
[81:03.76]Why do you guys have to be able to jump over that?
[81:09.85]I have to get rid of that one last guy.
[81:18.16]Why are you so good at this game?
[81:20.86]Good, go.
[81:22.68]Go on.
[81:23.86]Oh, you shitty.
[81:29.14]Oh.

[81:30.54]I think it's down.
[81:31.04]I'm gonna cross.
[81:38.80]Cross, cross, cross.
[81:40.50]No, not the fucking wall snakes.
[81:42.31]I hate those things.
[81:52.54]Did I had worse angles than a MySpace picture in 2006?

[82:16.47]Monster tree monster tree monster get rid of the tree monster Awful what are you talking about everybody like did like the shitty angles for their myspace pictures Like this I can't even pause the game.
[82:38.24]There's no pause that I can't pause the game.

[82:53.05]See, I just got fucking 10,000 likes!
[83:14.04]Of course you're gonna be down there, good.
[83:15.10]That was actually the perfect place.
[83:16.62]Nope, there's more than one.
[83:20.08]Before there was selfie cameras, that's true.
[83:25.10]What do I hear?
[83:29.58]I hear like... That's clearly Daffy from Gremlins 2.
[83:39.57]I'm not even kidding.
[83:41.01]Like, let's go.
[83:52.35]Hold on, give me a second.
[83:56.13]Look at this.
[83:56.79]The game's freaking out right now.
[83:57.63]It doesn't know what to do.
[84:00.85]Oh boy.
[84:01.37]Alright, I gotta make this, uh... Thank you, Ben.
[84:04.76]Ben Elnor again for another $50.
[84:07.34]And he says, Milkstream.
[84:12.40]Milkstream.
[84:13.89]I already dumped a bottle of milk.
[84:16.21]I dumped like a whole carton of milk in a suitcase.
[84:21.26]I'll drink milk.
[84:23.70]What?
[84:24.80]I'll drink milk.
[84:25.70]Yeah, I'll drink a milk on stream at some point.
[84:27.48]Fine, you know, I'll drink a milk on stream at some point in the next few days.
[84:31.98]Does it have to be cow's milk?
[84:33.84]Can it be like almond milk?
[84:37.06]Because I like almond milk.
[84:38.43]I like the way it tastes.
[84:39.99]Calm down, guys.
[84:40.97]Listen.
[84:44.33]Almond milk.
[84:45.15]So I don't like soy milk.
[84:46.81]I think soy milk tastes gross.
[84:48.99]Almond milk.
[84:50.17]The reason why I drink almond milk is because don't say gross.
[84:54.49]Everybody, you know what?
[84:56.14]Be cold, cold, cold, cold it down there.
[84:59.26]Cold it down there for a second.
[85:02.68]Just cold.
[85:04.00]Get in the freezer for five seconds and come back out and talk to me.
[85:08.82]Regular milk gives me problems.
[85:12.43]I like digest, I'm not lactose intolerant, I have colitis.
[85:18.72]That like, IBD, like Crohn's, colitis, like it's hard, I can't digest it that well.
[85:28.04]Anyways, I'm gonna drink a fucking milk on stream.
[85:35.39]Lay off.
[85:41.00]Finally, someone brave enough to say it.
[85:47.67]Almond milk actually doesn't taste that bad as long as you get like the unsweetened vanilla almond milk is actually pretty good.
[85:56.16]But thank you, Ben, for the $50.
[85:57.40]Much appreciated, man.
[85:58.08]That's
[86:00.29]I don't even know the total amount of money you're at now, but it's a lot.

[87:02.72]Hey, Jeremy, we're making these cool paper mache skulls in my art class.
[87:06.76]I was wondering if you would do a co-op kid cuisine review with Etalyx.
[87:15.48]How do those two things have any connection at all?
[87:21.32]I don't know.
[87:22.42]Sure.

[87:37.33]And then both of our channels will get banned.
[87:39.62]But, thank you.

[87:45.69]Dark Maniac 2283, thanks for the 75 cents.
[87:47.92]Jerm, I used these bits to tell you I'm out of bits.
[87:51.58]Also, actually, made a Twitter, and my attempt to DM you have failed miserably.
[87:57.24]Well, I have my DMs locked down to only people that I also follow.
[88:01.12]My DMs are used primarily for conspiring with other YouTubers.
[88:05.71]I make that sound really bad.
[88:09.86]I like to keep my DMs on Twitter open for colluding with it.
[88:16.82]That also sounds bad.
[88:19.98]For people that I'm working with.
[88:21.54]There you go.
[88:21.94]Okay, there it is.
[88:23.21]I can't even say.
[88:24.77]I'm so terrible when it comes to explaining those kind of things.
[88:28.71]Conspiring, colluding.
[88:30.31]Alright, let's keep going.
[88:35.97]What just happened to him?
[88:38.41]Thank you also to Cool Cat.
[88:40.69]Oh fuck, I missed it.
[88:41.93]Alright.
[88:43.97]I'll get it in a second.
[88:44.67]Hold on.
[88:45.45]We'll catch back up in a few minutes.
[88:53.14]Dude, honestly, let's talk about the word collude here.
[88:57.56]You guys think it's funny that if you hear somebody right now say the word collusion, what are they referring to?
[89:06.72]You know what I mean?
[89:07.50]That word, you can't use that word anymore.
[89:10.62]Unless you're talking about, like, what?
[89:13.84]You can't say, oh, you know, collusion.
[89:16.74]Oh, I know what you're talking about there.
[89:18.22]You must be talking about that investigation.
[89:22.33]Well, I mean, I know.
[89:24.33]The word collusion now means, like, Trump administration.
[89:27.01]That's, like, what the word means now.
[89:29.45]Oh, my God, will you pay attention?
[89:32.23]I'm going for it here.
[89:34.13]Speedrun.
[89:44.77]I don't know what it is about this stupid thing.
[89:46.43]I can't do it.
[89:49.17]Finally.
[89:49.55]We're good.
[89:51.56]We're safe.
[89:56.28]No, I'm talking... Remove politically.
[89:58.26]Just remove everything politically.
[89:59.84]Don't even talk about politics right now.
[90:02.94]Just simply the word, like, delusion.
[90:05.99]That's just what it means.
[90:07.15]It has a new meaning now.
[90:13.25]He's gone political.
[90:15.92]No, we don't talk about politics on this stream.
[90:21.28]Unless we're talking about a goddamn open and free internet.
[90:23.55]You know what I'm saying?
[90:25.69]We don't talk about politics on this stream unless we're talking about a goddamn open and free internet.
[90:32.35]Down with... Uh, no.
[90:36.46]Sometimes I get confused.
[90:38.96]I am for net neutrality.
[90:42.22]No, wait.
[90:42.80]Do you want to be for it or against it?
[90:44.84]Which one?
[90:45.36]You want to be against net neutrality?
[90:46.85]No you don't.
[90:47.19]What do you want to be against?
[90:47.93]Down with the internet!
[91:04.75]You want to keep the net neutral?
[91:07.95]None of the- No, no, no, no collusion!
[91:10.39]Excuse me, no obstruction!
[91:15.21]Damn it.
[91:18.46]He declares he's against net neutrality.
[91:24.56]Net neutrality is good.
[91:25.74]That means you want to be FOR net neutrality, not against it.
[91:29.42]You know, there's a lot of spin these days.
[91:30.90]You know what I'm saying?
[91:31.40]There's a lot of spin.
[91:37.95]Oh, fuck.
[91:38.95]This sucks.
[91:39.61]This is not gonna be fun.
[91:48.67]Christ.
[91:50.45]He's going to keep scaring them away.
[91:57.18]Of course.
[91:57.70]The one that... Let me make sure I get my position right here.
[92:03.98]Hold on.
[92:08.73]Net... Four net neutrality.
[92:14.23]I want to get my position straight.
[92:17.31]Let's see what the top things are.
[92:20.31]Okay, we've got... This is the top stories.
[92:23.50]I've got to make sure I'm aware of these situations.
[92:26.76]Comcast net neutrality pledged the same day the FCC announced a repeal.
[92:32.06]It deleted a page.
[92:34.10]Repealing net neutrality is bad.
[92:37.80]And a man accused of threatening to kill a congressman over net neutrality.
[92:42.26]Okay, well these are all...
[92:44.53]This is a hot topic.
[92:46.17]Jesus Christ.
[92:48.03]Really?
[92:49.49]That's not good.
[92:51.85]Those are the top three news stories at the moment.
[92:54.49]Okay.
[92:58.49]I love, okay, if you type into Google for net neutrality, type that in and look what the first result is.
[93:04.95]Like, no, no, no, not result.
[93:06.07]What's the first thing underneath it?
[93:09.19]Against net neutrality is right after it.
[93:18.21]FCC and net neutrality.
[93:19.63]Check to see if your name was used in fake comments.
[93:22.77]What?
[93:26.44]Oh, isn't this FCC chairman like a dickhead or something?
[93:28.66]Didn't he do something mean?
[93:33.67]Just check your name.
[93:44.41]We're going political.
[93:46.13]Now, I am for an open and free internet where nobody has any fucking power over anybody else.
[93:50.92]You know, companies can dictate what you can and can't see and watch.
[93:55.82]No fucking throttling.
[93:56.98]Don't throttle my Netflix.
[93:58.26]Don't touch my Netflix, okay?
[94:00.34]I use that.
[94:00.76]I watch a fucking lot of cooking shows.
[94:03.30]I watch Chopped on there all the time.
[94:05.10]You touch that and we're gonna have a big fucking problem.
[94:11.60]Can I pay attention for a moment?
[94:18.75]Yeah, what about Twitch?
[94:19.53]Okay, what if like Comcast didn't allow you to watch this stream?
[94:22.89]What if you had to be like a Verizon customer to watch this stream?
[94:26.39]That'd be fucked up.
[94:29.00]Where am I?
[94:33.96]I don't know.
[94:34.30]I guess we're going this way.
[94:38.40]What's the point of going this way?
[94:41.41]What the hell?
[94:41.99]Where am I?
[94:46.76]What is the point of going all the way down here?
[94:56.14]Oh my god.
[94:56.86]Alright, just go.
[94:57.66]Straight up.
[95:01.02]You know what?
[95:01.56]Now that I think about that, that actually is like a fairly... That's a fairly like catastrophic issue.
[95:07.17]Even just like Twitch.
[95:09.82]What if you just couldn't watch Twitch anymore?
[95:13.06]You know, all jokes aside, not fucking around anymore.
[95:15.30]We've made our, like, fake political jokes.
[95:18.86]Imagine if you just went to Twitch one day, and they're just like, sorry, you need to pay an extra $9.99 to sign up to that package.
[95:26.81]I'm gonna ride this out here for a sec, hold on.
[95:39.07]That should be... Why are they infinitely spawning underneath me?
[95:47.85]The one thing that sucks about this whole situation is, imagine if the cable companies started to treat net neutrality and shit like that like when you buy a TV package.
[96:00.55]Oh, you don't get HBO.
[96:02.07]You gotta pay for HBO, too.
[96:04.79]Do you want, oh wait, do you want HBO?
[96:07.17]Or do you want all the HBOs?
[96:09.39]Because there's a difference.
[96:14.65]Do you want HBO Signature?
[96:17.29]HBO 2?
[96:19.48]HBO 3?
[96:20.50]Those are all, those are different.
[96:25.30]Fuck with my Game of Thrones.
[96:27.80]Can I bump into this?
[96:32.92]What happens if I jump into this?
[96:37.59]Bad things.
[96:40.27]All the HBOs?
[96:41.01]Yeah, that's the point.
[96:43.69]Alright, I... I have to get by this awful, obnoxious portion of the game.
[96:49.57]Thank God it already automatically skipped it for me.
[96:55.24]Can I not get up there?
[96:59.68]NBC Sports Gold Edition.
[97:07.59]You can't tell if I'm joking about net neutrality or if I actually don't know what it is.
[97:12.47]I promise you I like know it.
[97:13.96]I'm just kidding around.
[97:14.84]I'm just joking.
[97:23.93]No, don't.
[97:25.29]Come on.
[97:27.75]You're gonna do it the second I move, aren't you?
[97:36.54]Oh god, I was in the weirdest spot there.
[97:42.11]Ah, this is so annoying.
[97:43.23]Just will you please, I'm playing whack-a-mole!
[97:50.71]Just kill me.
[97:57.29]Etalyx gave bits so you could go pick him up at the airport.
[98:04.26]Did somebody say late?
[98:05.14]What do you mean late?
[98:05.68]What are you talking about?
[98:06.42]I started my stream like 10 minutes early.
[98:19.73]I can't go that way.
[98:25.23]Can I like hit this?
[98:28.75]I gotta like climb up and touch that.
[98:30.17]No, this is not good.
[98:36.72]Fucking MySpace angles.
[98:40.34]Oh, goddammit.
[98:41.12]Fuck you, MySpace.
[98:43.42]I did it.
[98:47.92]I didn't do anything.
[98:48.85]Something went horribly wrong here.
[98:55.83]Don't die, because something got really fucked up, but it's okay.
[98:58.99]I saved the world.
[99:04.57]Don't kill me.
[99:06.89]Please don't kill me.
[99:07.81]Come on.
[99:08.27]Don't get me!
[99:09.25]Don't!
[99:14.57]We're all good.
[99:17.90]Crysis absolutely averted.
[99:21.02]He's not ready!
[99:22.06]I know he's not ready.
[99:23.80]Kallax does not land for like another 17 hours.
[99:26.21]He's coming all the way from England.
[99:40.29]I don't think that would make me fall I think I would hold on
[100:10.33]No, I really don't think that would make me fall.
[100:12.39]I'm not kidding.
[100:13.11]Why did it change what it's fucking it's following me Okay, Jesus man it was following me it was following me around Here we go stay here
[100:38.43]Hang on right here.
[100:40.31]He goes twice.
[100:42.44]No, let's see if I can zap him.
[100:43.64]Yeah, I can.
[100:50.48]Good to go.
[100:52.76]Can I go left?
[100:53.46]Oh, I gotta climb.
[100:54.15]Okay, good.
[101:00.31]Well, that's a lot of spiders.
[101:04.19]I don't think I should shoot them.
[101:05.61]No, I shouldn't.
[101:06.45]Should I?
[101:13.48]I guess... Oh, no.
[101:15.31]Alright, I'm not gonna shoot them this time.
[101:17.91]I'm gonna just go straight for it.
[101:26.73]Come on.
[101:33.19]There's no reason for that, man.
[101:34.59]There's no reason for it.
[101:38.58]Okay, don't... I just gotta ignore the spiders and I'll be alright.
[101:44.38]This is one of those games where if you press left or right, like, it's a weird full movement.
[101:48.85]It's hard to determine where it is.
[101:50.27]Alright, I'm good.
[101:57.03]Why are you taking more hits than last time?
[101:58.67]Alright, forget about the spiders.
[102:03.12]Spiders.
[102:04.16]Climb.
[102:05.84]We're just gonna go straight shot right up.
[102:07.80]Forget about it.
[102:08.30]Don't even look behind you.
[102:08.92]Don't shoot anybody.
[102:10.64]I'm just gonna make it to the top.
[102:11.52]I'm already in the right spot.
[102:12.62]Nope.
[102:12.94]Yes, I am.
[102:15.43]Almost there.
[102:18.01]Just get to the peak.
[102:21.20]Made it.
[102:23.66]Here comes the disk.
[102:29.06]Amigo!
[102:46.94]Another fall, yeah Don't you guys know that's the best way to have any transition in any video game ever?
[102:56.71]Just have somebody fall a great distance and bingo!
[103:00.37]Bongo!
[103:01.59]You're in a completely new environment
[103:10.30]Oh, he's not getting away from that.
[103:15.74]OK, move.
[103:18.26]Ah!
[103:20.20]Oh!
[103:35.20]You guys can't even keep track of the deaths I have in this game.
[103:38.72]It's not possible.
[103:39.72]We're gonna take it slow.
[103:45.51]Okay, only one more.
[103:46.95]Okay, no one in front of me, no one behind me.
[103:52.11]Straight.
[103:57.92]No.
[103:58.32]Okay, so someone has to stand here.
[104:04.51]Can I push this?
[104:05.09]I don't think so.
[104:08.68]Can I knock this down?
[104:15.54]No.
[104:16.40]I gotta have somebody stand on this, I think.
[104:19.32]Can't go up that.
[104:20.08]Oh, wait.
[104:24.40]Then I have to jump it.
[104:27.56]That hit me directly in the fucking head.
[104:29.70]That hit me right in the head.
[104:30.98]Okay, I gotta jump over it.
[104:37.80]Got it.
[104:42.77]It's just like that Cuphead video.
[104:46.15]That was the journalist portion of the game.
[104:49.67]Let me get this first try, thank god.
[104:57.18]That was disaster.
[105:02.86]Is he putting down slime?
[105:05.71]Yeah, I can't touch those.
[105:07.05]I gotta kill him.
[105:07.97]There's no shot here.
[105:09.91]Wait.
[105:15.97]Where's it gonna put me?
[105:18.19]Fuck.
[105:23.27]Oh, I got that first drive and now I'm all antsy and I can't do it again.
[105:30.28]Etalyx gave one- no, that's Itaiics.
[105:34.20]It Takes gave one dollar.
[105:35.88]Jerma, you're three hours late and I'm still at the airport.
[105:38.88]I've been trying to reach you and yet no response.
[105:43.24]Well, I'm sorry.
[105:44.18]Sorry to hear that, It Takes.
[105:48.00]I wasn't planning on getting you at the airport.
[105:58.73]Can I get him from here?
[106:00.23]No.
[106:01.15]I have to time this right.
[106:03.55]So we're gonna go up top right.
[106:05.43]Maybe we can just go across here, wait for this big goo to be... Oh, he's dead.
[106:13.52]Oh, fuck.
[106:13.86]What are you guys doing?
[106:18.40]What?
[106:18.90]What?
[106:19.60]Oh, fuck.
[106:20.10]He pounded his hand.
[106:21.48]Oh, no.
[106:22.20]Thank God.
[106:22.58]It's already here.
[106:31.99]Ah, he has to go three pounds.
[106:38.82]Oh god dammit.
[106:44.26]Are these the PC games that have very specific death animations?
[106:52.54]I have to like...
[106:59.26]God damn it.
[107:00.79]You can't jump across, you just slide down.
[107:02.57]Fine.
[107:10.85]Easy, alright.
[107:11.51]I won't even attack this guy, there's no reason to.
[107:18.00]Move, move, move.
[107:20.60]Watch out for this guy.
[107:22.62]Watch out for that guy.
[107:29.79]Clear out the mess?
[107:32.01]Really?
[107:35.26]I have to pee.
[107:37.18]I have to pee so bad.
[107:50.10]The animations are spectacular.
[107:54.93]If you say anything about this game, at least you can't say that it's got bad animations.
[108:03.28]It's very, very swell animations.
[108:12.69]Safe.
[108:13.29]Now I can climb across.
[108:14.33]Except it's probably gonna be those stupid things.
[108:17.65]The worms that come out of the walls.
[108:21.53]This is the easiest part of this whole encounter.
[108:24.15]Don't blow this.
[108:26.47]Wait till it comes up again.
[108:30.05]Any one of these pixels that even touches you, you die.
[108:32.36]So don't do it.
[108:34.80]Any more?
[108:35.10]I don't know.
[108:36.02]No.
[108:38.18]Safe to go.
[108:46.30]Shit.
[108:46.94]I gotta go back down.
[108:48.88]That's not gonna trickle all the way down here, is it?
[108:50.20]It is.
[108:53.41]I don't think they may- I can grab again.
[108:55.15]Here we go.
[108:58.64]Come on, that guy hasn't shot anything out.
[109:07.76]That's so lucky.
[109:13.18]You gotta be kidding me!
[109:14.26]Like, fucking angles!
[109:16.16]Oh, I'm so annoyed by this!
[109:19.47]I'm just going straight up.
[109:20.43]Just go straight up.
[109:21.47]Don't fight anybody.
[109:22.19]Don't even shoot them.
[109:30.29]Just go.
[109:35.36]I got one.
[109:47.43]Grab.
[109:49.05]Where's that worm?
[109:55.72]What are you doing, son?
[109:57.02]What am I doing?
[110:04.97]Right into another one.
[110:05.81]That sucks.
[110:07.93]Am I gonna play the end is nigh?
[110:09.77]I already did.
[110:17.41]I played The End is Nigh.
[110:20.72]And correct me if I'm wrong, I think I got really upset at that game.
[110:26.34]Boy.
[110:39.47]Really got to put the frustrating elements in the game here, don't you?
[110:47.61]Here come the grubs.
[110:48.43]You can only shoot top right, top left, straight.
[110:58.02]Lucky.
[111:00.96]Lucky.
[111:02.76]Lucky!
[111:04.12]LUCKY!
[111:05.26]That stu- I need to go get a scratch ticket.
[111:07.92]And just scratch the absolute fuck out of it.
[111:14.51]There is the dog.
[111:21.14]Skill, not luck.
[111:27.31]I saw that from all the way back here.
[111:34.50]I'm hitting this way.
[111:40.73]And... Got to get them back here.
[111:45.85]I think I can make it if I go all the way up.
[111:54.35]Told you, not one pixel.
[111:58.34]Now you moved.
[111:58.82]And I have to pee still.
[112:00.50]I have to go to the bathroom.
[112:02.44]What do I do?
[112:06.36]I knew that was going to happen.
[112:17.38]I'm not even paying attention Because I'm trying to move that I don't need a reason why don't won't happen again
[112:47.04]Yeah.
[112:47.98]Yeah.
[112:48.50]Okay.
[112:54.00]I gotta pee.
[112:58.26]Just burn me again.
[112:59.03]I gotta pee.
[112:59.75]I'll be right back.
[113:00.45]I gotta pee.
[113:00.93]I'll see you in a minute.
[113:49.53]Yeah.
[114:23.53]Wait, what?
[116:31.29]Hey.
[116:32.48]How are you?
[116:36.72]You can't believe I... What?
[116:37.92]What did I do?
[116:45.47]Let me ask you guys a question.
[116:48.97]I know this stream is like the pre-Etalyx Gets Here stream.
[116:54.89]But do you like this game?
[116:57.97]Do you want to keep watching this game?
[116:59.38]What would you say?
[117:02.79]Is this a game that you find interesting?
[117:05.81]I'll do like a poll maybe at some point.
[117:08.63]Whoopsie daisy.
[117:12.05]Eh.
[117:12.69]Maybe.
[117:13.09]Nah.
[117:15.46]It's okay.
[117:17.72]Yeah.
[117:19.26]We'll see.
[117:21.22]You have to see how it ends.
[117:26.36]I forgot to shoot him.
[117:27.62]Just jump in.
[117:28.16]Just jump in the water.
[117:28.79]No, no, no.
[117:29.23]I didn't have to do that.
[117:29.91]He was already ready.
[117:31.99]Game is fun.
[117:33.12]You're not.
[117:33.90]Huh?
[117:37.62]Wait, what does that mean?
[117:39.94]Is that you saying that you like the game, but you don't like me?
[117:42.80]Oh, that makes me feel bad.
[117:46.63]Now I feel bad.
[117:52.71]This screen in particular is going to be a pain.
[117:55.99]Okay, I got above it.
[118:01.75]Alright, don't screw this up.
[118:04.57]It's pre-recorded.
[118:07.25]It's not pre-recorded.
[118:08.27]It's current recorded.
[118:12.99]No, don't.
[118:24.66]Don't you dare.
[118:25.80]Please, you stupid bat.
[118:30.90]Meh!
[118:36.10]We're good.
[118:39.51]This chat is pre-recorded.
[118:45.73]Don't you guys understand?
[118:46.63]No, it's not.
[118:47.09]Look, anybody can say the chat is now pre-recorded.
[118:49.81]Anything you write down is being recorded.
[118:56.13]You already knew what you were going to say before you wrote it.
[119:00.75]You're writing pre-recorded messages.
[119:04.04]Because you're saying out loud in your head the thing that you want to write down.
[119:07.94]Let's say I want to write down, for instance, right now.
[119:10.42]Nice, Jerma.
[119:11.72]Fucking love the stream.
[119:13.98]You had to say that out loud in your head.
[119:16.78]And then you wrote it down.
[119:17.62]So that's a pre-recorded message that then you are relaying to the chat.
[119:22.06]I did it again.
[119:27.48]I did it again.
[119:28.19]I did it again.
[119:28.77]I did it again.
[119:41.73]Why am I having so much trouble with this screen?
[119:48.22]You can get in the goddamn sneaker.
[119:52.28]You don't think before typing?
[119:53.60]Yes, you do.
[119:54.08]You have to know how to type.
[119:56.70]You have to type it.
[119:59.07]You have to write it down.
[120:01.85]You have to think about what you are typing.
[120:07.31]Otherwise, how would you type it?
[120:14.54]Just go.
[120:19.97]I instantly died coming around this corner.
[120:21.57]Oh my god.
[120:30.70]I have to kill them before they get over here.
[120:32.18]One of them is going to go up top.
[120:34.92]One of them is going to go this way.
[120:35.90]Oh, shit.
[120:38.98]Come on.
[120:39.84]Come on.
[120:40.32]Do the same thing.
[120:42.43]Bad!
[120:43.39]Good.
[120:49.59]What's gonna happen here?
[120:53.41]It's been like six years since I played this game, I forget.
[120:57.64]I guess I'm gonna have to knock into this?
[120:59.12]So this is gonna get knocked over here and then go up, right?
[121:08.84]Make it go all the way up?
[121:09.88]What the hell did that do?
[121:14.13]That did nothing.
[121:19.53]I have to bounce it back over here.
[121:21.57]Oh, no.
[121:22.11]I have to climb all the way down.
[121:26.51]Well, this is a disaster.
[121:34.47]Why am I playing this game?
[121:35.79]This is one of my favorite games.
[121:38.49]I...
[121:59.30]Don't hit me in the hand.
[122:03.52]This happens, how many times does it happen in a fucking row?
[122:07.84]I don't, let me, wait for the big one.
[122:11.14]Big.
[122:12.24]One.
[122:13.64]Two.
[122:15.46]Two.
[122:21.38]One.
[122:22.48]Two.
[122:22.72]It happens twice after the big one.
[122:26.62]One.
[122:27.76]Two.
[122:31.89]One.
[122:32.89]Two.
[122:34.47]Only twice.
[122:35.01]Okay.
[122:41.12]I forgot about these guys.
[122:42.40]Can they shoot through the wall?
[122:46.22]No, they can't.
[122:50.76]Little dicks.
[122:54.59]Hey!
[122:55.05]Hey!
[123:15.56]Just get rid of them now.
[123:16.28]So I don't have to think about this shit anymore.
[123:20.59]Okay.
[123:23.59]Now make it over there.
[123:25.91]Without a problem, please.
[123:27.41]That would be nice.
[123:31.58]Big, little, little.
[123:37.20]Big, little, little.
[123:45.42]What am I doing?
[123:46.46]Stop it!
[123:46.82]Stop!
[123:57.97]I forgot about that.
[124:08.20]That wasn't even fucking close.
[124:18.62]Come on!
[124:21.91]How clunky is this game?
[124:23.03]Actually, it's very clunky.
[124:27.11]This is the definition of a clunky video game.
[124:35.48]Get over here.
[124:37.56]No, you fucking little asshole.
[124:40.58]Every time I shoot, he's not here.
[124:49.83]Right over my head.
[124:50.63]Do it.
[124:52.01]Fly over my head.
[124:58.57]What are you doing?
[125:00.98]What is this guy doing?
[125:04.02]Finally.
[125:06.82]Please don't mess this up anymore.
[125:09.68]Do more clown cart videos.
[125:11.26]Why is that being spammed?
[125:14.25]I haven't done any clown cart videos.
[125:15.75]It hasn't happened yet.
[125:17.47]It's going to.
[125:19.76]It's not right now.
[125:21.02]It's just one.
[125:27.63]One.
[125:30.21]We did it.
[125:31.75]We actually did it.
[125:34.29]No more nonsense.
[125:38.68]Now I can climb.
[125:39.56]I gotta climb back.
[125:40.68]It's gonna be kind of... Just slow down.
[125:44.78]And listen to yourself.
[125:46.58]Breathe.
[125:46.82]Breathe.
[125:52.06]Wait for the whole cycle.
[125:58.97]Wait for the whole cycle again.
[126:06.15]We got it.
[126:07.23]Thank God.
[126:08.53]Everything's fine.
[126:10.88]There's no issues around.
[126:12.10]No issues on this side of the table, you know what I mean?
[126:37.85]It, like, comes up the higher I'm... You know, I'm unplugging my headphones for this.
[126:43.59]You wanna see how much easier this is gonna be without any fucking audio?
[126:46.45]Watch this.
[126:48.83]Without this, like, obnoxious sounds in my ear.
[126:52.30]Take the fucking sound out of the equation, I'll do it right now, first try.
[126:55.52]Fast.
[126:57.56]After that.
[126:58.10]After this.
[126:58.94]I just barely sat down here.
[127:00.00]No sounds.
[127:01.66]No sounds.
[127:07.26]Doing pretty good without sound already.
[127:11.55]There's no audio to fuck me up.
[127:18.25]See how much easier video games are without sounds?
[127:27.74]Why is this giving me this?
[127:29.22]I'm just in a fucking, in an unclosable loop.
[127:33.84]I want to close the loop.
[127:36.00]This screen is not hard.
[127:38.68]It's not hard.
[127:41.56]This is not fucking hard to do.
[127:45.17]It's just, the fact that this whole, this takes so long.
[128:00.15]Oh, I am so angry right now.
[128:05.03]And the sound is still up.
[128:06.13]I don't even care.
[128:15.38]How did he not die?
[128:18.72]Give me that situation.
[128:20.88]Oh my fucking god.
[128:21.88]I can't believe this.
[128:23.93]I can't believe.
[128:25.27]Think of what we've been through so far.
[128:27.59]Think of the excruciating screens we've been through.
[128:31.09]This is the one that's causing me like a 30 minute problem.
[128:35.02]for no reason.
[128:36.04]You know what it was?
[128:37.02]I went to go to the fucking bathroom and I came back and I forgot how to play video games.
[128:49.05]What was wrong with, what was wrong with that?
[128:51.37]What was wrong with that?
[128:53.83]Give me the sounds back.
[128:58.69]This fucking stupid shit game.
[129:01.43]This game is fucking terrible.
[129:03.21]Wow, nostalgia.
[129:06.18]Another World is fucking awful too.
[129:07.66]They're both terrible games.
[129:11.24]We just pretend to like them.
[129:12.50]I just pretend to like this game so you think I'm interesting.
[129:14.58]I'm like just fucking like tilted.
[129:33.13]Buzzfeed.
[129:34.51]Buzzfeed was right.
[129:37.27]Why is this guy's pattern changing?
[129:43.13]Oh, you are such a stupid little dick.
[129:49.49]Somebody tell me I'm crazy.
[129:50.47]It's one hit to kill these guys.
[129:51.78]Why is it taking like four now?
[130:01.86]The world doesn't make any sense with that guy.
[130:03.40]I don't understand.
[130:12.79]Come on, get over here.
[130:16.39]He's not going to come over here, is he?
[130:18.13]He's going to make my life a living hell.
[130:21.49]Finally.
[130:31.56]Jerma is bad at games.
[130:32.88]Who saw that coming?
[130:34.70]No!
[130:35.86]You don't...
[130:37.59]Why would I even try to, like, rebuttal the fact that I'm playing a fucking 20-year-old piece of shit game with some of the sloppiest controls in all of the entire industry?
[130:47.85]Don't fucking touch that.
[130:53.03]Go look at the IGN review.
[130:54.19]What does it say?
[130:56.59]Fucking sloppiest controls this side of the Mississippi is like a direct quote.
[131:10.31]This fucking game got like a 2 from IGN.
[131:20.39]Look at this guy fucking angry on stream.
[131:24.52]He's old.
[131:27.22]Grandpa's like drinking again in the corner.
[131:35.94]Don't do that again.
[131:39.90]We did it.
[131:41.04]Get me out of this.
[131:44.70]Go, go, go, go, go.
[131:45.70]Hurry, faster.
[132:22.03]No, I'm not going to get angry.
[132:22.89]That's what you guys expect.
[132:23.77]You expect me to be like, what?
[132:25.05]What?
[132:25.45]What?
[132:25.79]Whoa!
[132:27.43]Whoa!
[132:27.61]No, I'm not going to happen.
[132:29.25]I'm not going to get comically angry at that.
[132:33.41]Let's bring our voices down.
[132:36.33]No, I'm not going to say, whoa, one time.
[132:37.53]You're not going to hear me say, whoa.
[132:40.41]Not going to happen.
[132:44.73]My silence is proof that I'm angry?
[132:46.11]No, my silence is proof that I am a collected human.
[132:50.45]I've collected humans.
[132:51.75]I'm a collectible human.
[132:52.67]I've collected it.
[132:53.39]I'm collected.
[132:54.03]I'm fine.
[132:54.73]I'm fine.
[132:56.35]Look.
[132:57.15]Would somebody say they're fine if they weren't fine?
[132:59.74]I'm fine.
[133:01.44]I'm alright.
[133:03.58]Shit happens, man.
[133:04.74]Dark Souls get good.
[133:05.72]They're gonna throw like crazy shit at you.
[133:10.30]I'm cool.
[133:11.02]I'm good.
[133:19.66]Denial is the first step.
[133:24.33]Serenity.
[133:24.99]I feel good.
[133:29.79]Just gotta not get hit by the fireballs that come down the hallway.
[133:34.79]And I'll be good.
[133:37.61]Where's Etalyx?
[133:38.33]Who gives a shit?
[133:39.57]He can fucking walk home.
[133:44.48]Where's Etalyx?
[133:45.50]I don't know.
[133:45.84]Guess what?
[133:46.30]After like an hour and a half at the airport without like... He'll figure it out.
[133:50.05]That's so terrible.
[133:59.47]Alright.
[134:00.05]Do... Do not do that again.
[134:03.53]They don't... You don't trigger their spawn until you go over here.
[134:08.22]So we're gonna go like this and I'm gonna hang out right here.
[134:13.68]Come on down.
[134:16.54]Okay.
[134:18.14]I think we're good.
[134:20.68]Thank the Lord we're good.
[134:23.92]I was about to fucking drill this guy.
[134:26.84]Oh, remember the spoiler I gave you?
[134:52.37]And here he goes.
[134:55.05]Watch.
[134:56.57]Go!
[134:57.33]Go!
[134:57.59]Go!
[134:58.13]Go!
[135:17.05]I love the chimpanzee noise.
[135:20.76]That, like... Alright, what's the over-under that I'm gonna fall?
[135:33.74]Here comes the giant drop.
[135:38.14]That counts as a fall.
[135:38.96]I fell.
[135:41.26]Wasn't that far, but I fell.
[135:44.10]That was the bait and switch.
[135:45.10]Here comes the real fall.
[136:00.11]Oh, this is where you get squashed.
[136:02.31]I'm inside of a piano.
[136:10.01]Oh, God.
[136:10.72]No, she... I forgot about this part.
[136:17.00]You get fucking crushed, man.
[136:18.88]One, two... Jesus, man.
[136:25.14]Slow down.
[136:27.00]Slow down.
[136:31.26]There.
[136:32.38]Now, oh, oh, oh, what about it?
[136:38.44]That's what you gotta do.
[136:41.29]Go down.
[136:43.55]What, no, can I block that?
[136:45.93]No, what do I do?
[136:47.41]What do I do?
[136:48.97]I gotta... Can I drop this without going down?
[137:00.83]Okay, so... That should block that.
[137:08.28]Yes.
[137:08.90]Okay.
[137:11.98]Push this button?
[137:14.06]Which should... Open this up.
[137:17.24]Alright, we're good.
[137:23.12]This guy is freaking me out.
[137:24.56]No, he's... That's like... He can spawn enemies.
[137:35.74]Uh-huh.
[137:37.18]Oh, hello.
[137:41.04]Get off.
[137:43.76]Oh, come on.
[137:44.36]Get off.
[137:47.99]Just hit him in the legs.
[137:49.93]Most effective.
[137:54.35]That was lucky.
[137:56.57]When do I get my Ghostbusters pack back?
[138:02.90]Safe.
[138:04.16]Oh, Jesus.
[138:10.79]Oh!
[138:17.80]Oh, I cannot hold... I am holding this button as straight down as I can.
[138:24.08]So it goes one, does it go two?
[138:25.64]Just one.
[138:26.22]Oh, it is actually hard to hold this down.
[138:36.71]Don't crush it.
[138:37.19]Okay.
[138:41.84]It's gonna hit me!
[138:43.70]I gotta remember, there's people... What the fuck are you talking about, man?
[138:51.59]Anybody else have that problem?
[138:52.71]With, like, sweaty ass thumbs?
[138:54.67]If I have to hold down an analog, like, straight down... I start to sweat on my hands.
[139:00.38]And then I can't do it.
[139:01.08]I can only do it for, like, ten straight seconds.
[139:04.60]Anybody else have that feeling?
[139:05.92]Have that problem?
[139:14.74]Like, me holding down right now, I'm falling.
[139:17.08]Watch this.
[139:17.40]I'll turn on the cam.
[139:18.83]I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about.
[139:19.91]Watch this.
[139:20.35]We'll do it like a finger cam.
[139:27.27]Piece of shit.
[139:27.79]Get up there.
[139:33.22]I'll show you what I mean.
[139:36.00]Don't even tell me that I just fucked up something.
[139:41.33]No, I'm good.
[139:41.75]I don't know what that was, but whatever.
[139:45.93]Forget about how dirty the desk is.
[139:47.49]It's fine.
[139:48.02]There's like sprinkles on here.
[139:53.02]It's like some old food.
[139:54.64]Just forget it.
[139:56.16]I'm cleaning the desk before Etalyx gets here anyways.
[139:58.02]He's not going to be angry about this.
[140:01.32]There's like some sprinkles.
[140:03.72]There's like a beer over here.
[140:05.68]No, this is a cream soda.
[140:06.71]Everything's fine.
[140:07.37]Just chill.
[140:09.27]What is here?
[140:09.77]What is this?
[140:11.55]What is this?
[140:16.10]What is this?
[140:17.54]What is, like, right here?
[140:19.04]Oh, that's just a bunch of other, like, trash.
[140:20.48]Like, who cares?
[140:22.88]This is what I'm talking about.
[140:24.12]I'll show you.
[140:26.70]So watch this.
[140:28.54]You can see, right?
[140:30.35]So watch what happens when I do this.
[140:32.81]Can you see?
[140:33.19]I'm going to turn the brightness up.
[140:34.63]We'll turn the brightness up a little.
[140:39.18]I'm not going to get ants.
[140:39.96]I'm cleaning the room.
[140:40.64]I'm literally going to clean the room in five seconds.
[140:43.04]The stream's going to end in five seconds.
[140:46.50]Let's go to brightness.
[140:49.28]I really want you to be able to see this.
[140:52.23]You can see that.
[140:52.83]Good.
[140:53.41]Ready?
[140:55.05]Watch.
[140:57.11]Keep an eye on that thumb.
[141:03.61]Let's see.
[141:04.09]Ready?
[141:04.30]Here we go.
[141:11.40]See, watch what happens here.
[141:13.83]We're good right now.
[141:14.87]We're good right now.
[141:18.77]I'm holding it now.
[141:19.75]See?
[141:21.43]Watch this.
[141:32.64]I'm already going down.
[141:34.98]I can feel the sweat building right now.
[141:43.17]No!
[141:46.26]I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling!
[141:49.02]See?
[141:53.42]Can you see that?
[141:55.63]Disgusting.
[142:04.11]How do I hold the controller upside down?
[142:05.54]Because I'm a goddamn magician.
[142:18.47]I clean my desk.
[142:19.37]I'm gonna clean my desk before Etalyx gets here.
[142:23.39]I think I may have just completely fucked myself here.
[142:29.03]No, so what does this do?
[142:29.83]Do I have to climb back up?
[142:35.75]Maybe I... Can I push this?
[142:37.17]Will this push this button?
[142:38.19]I wonder if this is a button.
[142:42.29]Yes, it is.
[142:55.67]There it is.
[142:58.29]Now everybody has a ton of energy.
[143:02.57]Why am I using the middle of my thumb?
[143:03.99]Because the tops of my fingers?
[143:05.43]What do you mean tops of my fingers?
[143:06.65]It's not possible.
[143:11.71]Safe.
[143:15.87]So now it's a war.
[143:17.61]We have strength.
[143:21.31]I'm just one of the casualties of war.
[143:29.50]What's going on here?
[143:36.14]I think I just have to fight.
[143:37.40]I don't think there's any, uh... inherently... interesting thing to do here.
[143:45.27]Besides fight.
[143:49.03]Oh, maybe it's something I do over here?
[143:50.39]No.
[143:52.33]Someone needs to wake up that fucking fat guy in the background and tell him to shoot some magic.
[143:58.38]Alright, we're good, right?
[143:59.14]Here we go.
[144:01.92]100 bucks!
[144:02.10]We've got the power!
[144:03.92]Let's rattle some more!
[144:11.94]Hey, thank you, Sam.
[144:13.40]Sam, and... Sam.
[144:15.49]Hi, Sam.
[144:15.87]Thanks, Sam.
[144:17.59]For the $1.30.
[144:18.31]And you say, I've told this joke before, but you don't... You didn't read it.
[144:21.69]And we all know the best way to make you... Make sure people know you made a joke is to repeat it over and over.
[144:26.97]Why did the Scarecrow get a promotion?
[144:30.54]Because he was outstanding in his field.
[144:32.30]Okay!
[144:42.78]I've been hovering over demod.
[144:46.12]No, I'm not gonna do it.
[144:47.28]Okay.
[144:49.59]That was close.
[144:50.35]That was a close demoderation.
[144:52.27]That was close.
[144:52.75]That was about 15 points away.
[144:55.21]That was a .2 on the degrees away.
[145:02.92]Demod.
[145:05.14]Thank you, Sam.
[145:06.10]Good job.
[145:08.48]uh also thank you to a tasty pizza thank you tasty pizza 25 cents cookie crm thanks for the ten dollars uh cookie says Jerma it's my friend's birthday recently he's been going through a lot and he doesn't know you're streaming and I think he deserves to hear it as a surprise from someone he's looked up to if not I'll understand thank you for being you Jerma for helping us both through life
[145:32.42]If you say yes, I'll tell him to join the stream, and you can say it, like, a couple minutes after you say it, from two fans.
[145:39.53]Like, happy birthday, what's his name?
[145:42.51]What's your friend's name?
[145:44.27]Absolutely, let's fucking do it.
[145:46.09]So, what's his name?
[145:48.71]Cookie, what's his name?
[145:56.78]Nicholas.
[145:57.96]Nicholas, alright, yeah, let's do it.
[146:00.63]So what, in like two minutes?
[146:02.23]I'm going to do it in like five minutes.
[146:05.17]Just to make sure that he gets here and everything.
[146:07.17]But you guys are going to blow it.
[146:10.02]Don't write his name in the chat, guys.
[146:11.66]You're going to blow it.
[146:13.42]He's going to see his name typed like a thousand times and be like, why are people writing my name?
[146:18.88]Don't blow it.
[146:23.44]Ow.
[146:26.72]Everyone act natural for crying out loud.
[146:38.07]Any other discernible information?
[146:39.47]So it's not just a random, like, oh, hey, Nick!
[146:43.50]Because that could be a big... There's like 2,400 people here.
[146:46.62]There could be a couple of Nicolases here.
[146:51.12]Nicholas, like... Okay.
[146:53.84]Cool it.
[146:54.54]Cool it!
[146:54.90]Cool it!

[147:00.90]I'm a collusion.
[147:11.81]Hey.
[147:12.93]This game is messed up.
[147:14.03]What a fucking weird game.
[147:16.03]I'll tell you right now, this is like one of the weirdest games I've ever played.
[147:21.56]Let's just take a minute here and just make sure I can... shoot in green fire.
[147:25.58]Green fire.
[147:28.50]So, red versus green.
[147:30.52]Man, am I like a... We must be fighting over there.
[147:34.76]Eternal stoplights, you know what I mean?
[147:36.68]Hey, Nick!
[147:37.48]Hey, Nicholas, what's up, dude?
[147:39.59]Didn't think you're gonna join the stream and like all of a sudden we're gonna start saying your name, did you, Nicholas?
[147:43.99]Heard it's your goddamn birthday.
[147:46.43]That's right.
[147:47.73]We heard it's your birthday, Nick.
[147:50.30]Hey!
[147:56.34]It's so bright.
[147:58.04]Happy fucking birthday, Nick.
[147:59.90]Happy birthday.
[148:01.30]Hope you have a good one.
[148:04.14]Happy birthday to you, Nicholas.
[148:11.42]Hope you have a good one.
[148:20.48]Merry Christmas!
[148:22.48]Happy Holidays!
[148:26.44]Is he here?
[148:26.98]Phil's birthday.
[148:33.81]Alright, I'm gonna keep losing.
[148:42.95]Hold on, wait, wait, he's... Is he here?
[148:46.35]Otherwise, we'd have to do it again.
[148:56.62]Did I time it?
[148:57.34]It was timed?
[149:03.76]Alright, well, just do like... Hold on, just in case, like... Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down.
[149:08.23]This fucking game is hard.
[149:14.28]I just don't know where to, like, where do you... Is there a safe place to stand?
[149:19.20]Ah, shit.
[149:21.74]Just gotta get, like, some good skill shots here.
[149:26.41]Almost.
[149:28.57]Stop moving around so much, man.
[149:37.09]Almost.
[149:39.02]As long as I can get him before the second screen happens.
[149:44.17]And I'll take out the second screen here.
[149:45.57]Actually, I'm going to pull these guys over to the right.
[149:47.20]Because I know he can't shoot through the... Yeah, he can't shoot through it.
[149:56.70]That's good.
[149:58.40]One more.
[149:58.80]One more big guy.
[149:59.73]That should be one more over here.
[150:01.13]That is one more large.
[150:06.21]Scoop that out.
[150:07.67]That's all good.
[150:09.13]Hey, Nicholas!
[150:10.07]What's going on, buddy?
[150:11.19]Nicholas, happy birthday, man!
[150:13.09]Didn't think that you were gonna see somebody giving you, like, a special happy birthday, did you?
[150:17.51]Happy birthday, Nicholas.
[150:19.58]Hope it's a good one.
[150:22.34]We all fucking love you.
[150:31.06]Is he here?
[150:34.53]That scared me.
[150:42.50]This is fucking scary.
[150:46.64]Alright, now we can go in the cave.
[150:52.49]No, but if you actually are here, though, dude, happy birthday.
[150:59.07]I don't think I can kill these things.
[151:00.51]I think this guy comes back to life, I think.
[151:03.53]No, just have to blow up his... Well, they turn into two people if you don't.
[151:11.52]Jump scare.
[151:17.15]What time is it?
[151:17.51]I gotta go get Etalyx.
[151:18.39]Oh shit, what time is it?
[151:22.37]Happy birthday, Nicholas!
[151:37.16]I'm good.
[151:39.58]Stop.
[151:42.46]Can I get across there?
[151:43.38]I think I have to walk slowly.
[151:51.47]Oh, okay.
[151:56.82]Watch it.
[151:58.00]There's a couple of guys on the ceiling.
[151:59.68]I don't want to be fucking with nobody on the ceiling, you know what I'm saying?
[152:06.04]That's why I can turn to four people.
[152:11.84]Oh, great.
[152:13.74]Of course they had to put these stupid idiots on the ceiling.
[152:16.56]These stupid idiots.
[152:23.81]I think this is gonna never end.
[152:27.15]Yeah, this is never gonna end.
[152:30.65]I didn't know he could do that!
[152:31.71]Okay.
[152:33.95]I gotta pick up Nicholas.
[152:36.49]I gotta pick up Vitalix.
[152:37.92]I have to go pick up Vitalix.
[152:40.20]Sorry, that was the name that was in my brain, so I had to say that.
[152:53.89]God damn it.
[152:55.51]Alright, yeah.
[152:56.83]Short stream.
[152:58.27]Short stream tonight.
[152:59.19]I gotta go get a Etalyx.
[153:04.70]If you guys really want to see me finish this game, maybe I will.
[153:09.96]No face cam.
[153:11.66]Trying to say something?
[153:13.27]Alright, I gotta go.
[153:14.53]What time is it?
[153:15.81]9.30?
[153:15.89]I gotta go.
[153:21.63]I gotta go.
[153:23.68]I gotta go.
[153:24.04]You know what I mean?
[153:25.54]I gotta go.
[153:26.91]I gotta get out of here.
[153:28.75]I gotta get out of here, man.
[153:30.29]I gotta go.
[153:30.71]Alright, I'll see you guys.
[153:40.93]You know, like, I gotta go.
[153:43.22]I gotta... Never mind, that's not gonna work.
[153:45.62]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[153:47.04]See you guys tomorrow.
[153:49.66]The talcs will be here.
[153:52.15]Sorry for the two and a half hour stream.
[153:54.05]I would have liked to have finished this game in one stream.
[153:57.15]But... Etalyx needs to be picked up.
[154:02.57]Otherwise he'll just sit at the airport and I can't... I can't do that to my friend Etalyx.
[154:09.02]So tomorrow... I'm not sure what we're going to do.
[154:12.02]But expect... Expect like a camera on... You know, I'm going to be sitting here like this.
[154:19.98]Like...
[154:22.56]Like a controller in my hand.
[154:23.58]And he'll be like right here.
[154:24.66]In like another chair.
[154:26.14]And we'll play a co-op game where we're both sitting there like having a fun time.
[154:29.74]Like talking shit to each other.
[154:30.98]It's going to be bad.
[154:35.98]It's going to be... You can skip tomorrow's stream.
[154:38.64]It's probably not going to be fun.
[154:41.10]You know, why am I actively telling people not to come to the stream?
[154:45.75]No, it'll be fun.
[154:48.42]We'll probably, like, yeah, whatever.
[154:50.70]You guys know, I said it in the beginning, but there's probably a lot less people.
[154:53.47]Like, wait, why is this?
[154:54.69]Stop that.
[154:56.87]There's probably a lot less people than there were right now.
[154:59.45]But I will see you guys tomorrow.
[155:01.05]We're going to play some local co-op games that we cannot play online.
[155:04.89]So we're going to compile a list.
[155:07.89]And hopefully you guys will enjoy it.
[155:09.29]And hopefully we will too.
[155:11.52]Good night, everybody.
[155:13.66]See you tomorrow.
[155:14.40]Same time, same network.
[155:18.22]And make sure I didn't miss any bits.
[155:22.28]I don't think I did.
[155:23.08]Maybe a couple here.
[155:24.04]Let's get a couple before the stream is over.
[155:31.53]For real though, thanks for the $5.
[155:34.18]Since we are talking about net neutrality a few minutes ago, I recommend everybody use ResistBot to send messages to their representatives in order to affirm your position on the subject.
[155:45.27]You can easily find it on Google.
[155:47.19]If that's a reputable source, then yeah.
[155:49.98]Resist.
[155:50.82]Resist.
[155:52.62]Resist!
[155:57.86]But thank you for real though.
[156:00.98]Thank you Milarkey for the $1.
[156:02.78]Go back for Flanker.
[156:06.10]Alright, speaking of going back, you are going back a year.
[156:10.55]We've got to rewind a full year of streaming to do that, because it's coming up on... It's coming up on that full time, full for one year, right?
[156:20.10]It already happened back in October?
[156:22.62]November?
[156:23.00]When was my first full year full time?
[156:26.87]And by full-time, I'm talking just streaming on a schedule for a lot of time.
[156:33.48]Not like full-time streamer, but like full-time part of the time.
[156:41.14]I don't know.
[156:42.30]I think it's been like a year and a half, maybe?
[156:45.66]Time does fly.
[156:50.87]Asha, thank you for the 342.
[156:51.83]Nobody tell Jerma that we're giving him bits.
[156:56.89]You still don't follow a schedule?
[156:57.99]Yes, I do.
[157:00.83]I stream pretty much every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, unless something's going on, then I have to move them.
[157:07.07]There's at least three or four streams a week on this channel.
[157:10.47]If I have to move a stream, I move it, but I think I've been at least pretty consistent.
[157:16.76]Now, starting time, that's not true.
[157:18.52]Starting time has been between like 6.30 and 9 every time.
[157:22.62]But you know what?
[157:23.24]You get better as you stream, you become a professional streamer.
[157:28.52]And like, I'm going to be, I'm going to be, this is 2018 is the year of the professional streamer.
[157:33.76]I'm going to add a day.
[157:34.98]We're adding a day in 2018.
[157:36.04]So it's going to be four days a week.
[157:41.11]And I'm going to crash a fucking clown car in May.
[157:47.41]I don't know.
[157:49.43]Why did I just say that?
[157:51.47]But thank you guys.
[157:53.35]Also, Eliobot, thank you for the $1.
[157:56.23]Hey there, Jerma, it's me, Etalyx.
[157:58.15]I've been waiting at the parking lot of airport for 37 hours now.
[158:02.37]I've had nothing but Kid Pick Studio to keep me entertained.
[158:05.63]I've been trying to contact your MySpace page, but you have yet to respond.
[158:09.20]Please come pick me up when you can.
[158:14.15]Again, Asha, thanks for the $3.58.
[158:15.07]I'm not gonna even give you the satisfaction of finishing that statement.
[158:37.20]have to be care I can't okay I gotta be careful because like if somebody like just is jumping in this stream and hears me say that and doesn't know that I'm just being like a facetious like ash the having trouble with talking tonight apparently but for real though thank you asher can't wait for the third one whatever the that comes out I'll be old by the time that actually releases
[159:05.03]But thanks.

[159:18.41]Sticks, thanks for the $1.
[159:19.51]IRL stream yourself picking up Etalyx.
[159:21.78]No, I'm not going to drive a car and stream.
[159:24.08]Are you serious?
[159:27.12]You're talking about like three illegal things at the same time.
[159:29.68]You know, like on the phone while driving.
[159:34.52]Like stream like talking to like it's like more than 2,000 people while driving.
[159:39.36]That's number one driving with one hand problem of number two Problem the GoPro.
[159:46.54]No, I'm not gonna drive a car and stream That's dangerous shit That's fucking dangerous and I'm pretty I'm pretty certain that's illegal in Massachusetts.
[159:59.58]I don't think I can do that.
[160:00.32]I
[160:02.43]That's only one illegal thing.
[160:03.99]That's one illegal thing spread over three different illegal situations.
[160:10.61]Have the phone in the back.
[160:11.51]Just, like, put the phone in the back and put it, like, throw it down there and just have it... No!
[160:15.52]That's fucking weird.
[160:17.32]That's a good reverse surveillance video.
