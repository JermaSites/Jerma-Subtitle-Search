[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.60]Wait, did you put a wink in there?
[00:03.28]Come on.
[00:04.22]I don't even remember how to stream.
[00:06.28]Hold on a second.
[00:09.00]Alright.
[00:09.58]I just did the thing.
[00:12.52]And when you do that thing, that's how you know it's time to clean your room.
[00:16.64]What I've done is I stacked a glass on top of another glass because there's no room for two glasses.
[00:24.43]So, it's time.
[00:26.13]It's time to clean this room.
[00:28.81]So, we have a wink.
[00:32.59]Of course we do.
[00:33.81]In five seconds.
[00:35.47]Disgusting pigsty.
[00:36.79]No, no, I know.
[00:37.61]It's not that bad.
[00:38.33]This just documents all of the floor of all my personal information.
[00:42.75]PlayStation 2 games and glassware everywhere.
[00:45.91]It's not like it's dirty.
[00:46.95]It's just stuff.
[00:47.99]That's one thing I want to make sure.
[00:49.13]I want to talk to you guys about this.
[00:50.95]I know there's a wink.
[00:52.75]We'll get it.
[00:54.41]Dirty versus clutter.
[00:59.37]My room's not dirty.
[01:01.15]It's just cluttered.
[01:03.54]There's nothing in here that's disgusting.
[01:08.34]It's just stuff on the ground.
[01:11.15]So why then... Actually, no, hold on, never mind, that's a lie.
[01:14.17]There's a... Alright, fuck, I lose.
[01:17.51]There's a glass of coffee in it.
[01:22.23]That's, uh... Definitely been sitting there for, like, at least five days.
[01:28.82]Alright, I lose.
[01:29.50]I could clean it.
[01:31.47]That's fucking horrible.
[01:33.29]I just looked behind me and saw it.
[01:34.27]But anyways, I had a good break.
[01:36.77]A lot of friends came up.
[01:39.59]We had a good time.
[01:43.65]And... Moldy?
[01:46.50]No, no, no.
[01:46.98]It's not.
[01:47.36]It's not.
[01:47.66]It's fine.
[01:49.24]Go clean it right now.
[01:54.14]It's fine.
[01:54.54]It's fine.
[01:57.42]No, it's going to be fine.
[01:59.25]Alright.
[02:30.36]Alright, we're good.
[02:33.66]I put water in and I went... ...and dumped it.
[02:39.11]The mold got him.
[02:40.17]There's no mold on... Okay, there's no mold in that cup.
[02:44.27]Hold on, let me... I gotta wink.
[02:47.63]Yeah, this is a spoiler.
[02:48.47]You're not even supposed to see this shit yet.
[02:52.44]Where's my camera?
[02:53.52]Hey.
[03:14.78]What am I doing?
[03:19.04]Alright, that was the entire right side of a magazine.
[03:23.73]If you have, like, the Cosmopolitan magazine.
[03:26.97]That was the entire right page for a fucking scent app.
[03:33.19]You just put text here that says, like, Stunning.
[03:35.73]Daring.
[03:37.26]Smells.
[03:38.36]And then, like, dot, dot, dot.
[03:41.60]Invigoration.
[03:42.80]Or whatever the hell the thing is called.
[03:48.24]The whole page ads.
[03:49.32]Fuck off with these full page ads.
[03:50.58]You want to know why nobody reads magazines anymore?
[03:54.34]Because the thing is 35 pages thick and there's 18 pages of ads.
[03:59.05]That's why nobody reads them anymore.
[04:02.11]Stupid.
[04:04.11]I winked.
[04:04.47]I winked like three times.
[04:11.74]Dude, I can't imagine...
[04:15.12]Having a magazine company right now and the only people that read it are people that have phones that are about to die at the doctor's office.
[04:26.05]And they don't want to sit there and read their phones.
[04:27.63]It's like, fuck, I have to read something else here.
[04:33.89]It's going to be louder.
[04:39.27]I forgot the Lord of the Rings was in the background.
[04:41.61]Sorry.
[04:42.85]Hey, let me redo that one.
[04:43.83]You heard it.
[04:46.00]The only people that read magazines are people that have boarded the doctor's office that don't want to fucking know you heard it.
[04:50.37]We're going to play Lord of the Rings Return of the King on PlayStation 2 today.
[04:53.93]And I felt it was appropriate.
[04:55.75]I'm returning to streaming after about eight or nine days, so we're going to return to the king.
[05:03.86]Now it's too quiet.
[05:04.56]I'll fix it, don't worry.
[05:08.28]I'm going to explain why you are late.
[05:11.40]No, that's a pre-stream thing.
[05:12.62]That's a pre-stream thing.
[05:13.53]And now we'll find it'll be an out-stream thing.
[05:17.47]I hate starting an activity where I know I'm going to be long-term locked in.
[05:24.70]But it doesn't matter what it is.
[05:25.92]I could be going fishing for all that matters.
[05:28.98]And if I have a dump building, that's a bad way to put it.
[05:33.02]Let's be medical about this.
[05:34.63]If I have to use the bath verb imminently,
[05:39.61]I do not want to do anything until that is taken care of.
[05:45.92]It doesn't matter what it is.
[05:48.12]So I had to take care of that before I started my livestream.
[05:54.13]Because if you do not take care of that, if you do not let the process get started and finish, then you are stuck.
[06:01.40]You are stuck needing to go use the restroom.
[06:04.20]You have to use the bathroom at some point.
[06:06.44]In an opportunity that might not be the greatest time.
[06:09.68]I hate that.
[06:10.40]No.
[06:10.94]That doesn't happen to me.
[06:13.00]The reason why it happened today is because I ate food after 11 o'clock last night.
[06:16.96]Which is like, come on.
[06:17.60]What am I thinking?
[06:19.04]That's how you make that happen.
[06:21.26]Alright.
[06:21.50]I'm going to play.
[06:22.28]I didn't even make a tweet.
[06:23.96]Hold on.
[06:24.56]No.
[06:24.90]It's because I had to wink.
[06:26.50]Go back to the intro.
[06:27.18]We're not ready.
[06:32.12]Oh, we have huge bits coming in, too.
[06:37.61]Filactory gave... Let me get the good one.
[06:39.53]Hold on.
[06:41.03]Let me get the good one out.
[06:42.57]What?
[06:42.85]Why am I... What are these pictures on my phone?
[06:45.73]What am I doing?
[06:46.40]Alright, hold on.
[06:48.96]Alright, I'll be right back.
[06:49.96]I'm out...
[07:03.68]Okay, this is funny to me.
[07:05.20]Because if you just browse your Twitter, and you knew that I... Oh, yeah, that's right.
[07:11.46]Jerm has been gone.
[07:12.26]Jerm has been gone for like 10 days.
[07:15.15]The first tweet is return of the king.
[07:19.29]And then a link to my Twitch.
[07:23.05]Like, how many people might just scroll by them and be like, really dude?
[07:26.22]Like, return of the fucking king?
[07:27.62]Oh wow, you were gone for like a week and a half.
[07:32.08]You're the best.
[07:33.04]Yeah, return of the king.
[07:33.96]Whatever.
[07:35.91]Alright, what does everybody ask?
[07:38.61]No, somebody gave him money.
[07:39.65]Let me get that up.
[07:46.35]You know, here's the worst part about when you don't... Okay, I haven't turned my computer on for 10 days.
[07:51.97]So, every time... I don't know, how many updates does your computer fucking have to do?
[07:56.75]You just don't even realize just how much shit your computer does in the background.
[07:59.78]10 days of no updates and no downloads and shit.
[08:08.00]It's so obnoxious.
[08:09.48]Anyways, Spiral Actuary gave $50...
[08:14.73]Wait, are we losing Frank?
[08:15.77]No, we're not.
[08:17.35]Why'd you say Cox?
[08:17.97]Ugh.
[08:35.63]I'm not... It's alright.
[08:37.63]It's okay.
[08:39.92]And 15 community subs from Ampharic.
[08:42.40]Thanks, Ampharic.
[08:42.96]Okay, welcome back, everybody.
[08:45.82]You didn't forget about me!
[08:49.40]That's good.
[08:52.55]A week on the internet is like three years real time.
[08:55.83]You know what I mean?
[08:56.65]I'm surprised everyone even knows who I am.
[09:03.18]Thank you, Phylactery.
[09:03.86]And thank you, Ampharic.
[09:06.64]It's time.
[09:11.22]Lord of the Rings Return of the King on PlayStation 2.
[09:13.50]I'm ready.
[09:20.23]It's a little blurry, but what am I gonna do?
[09:26.03]We're not playing on hard.
[09:27.33]This is not gonna be a 16-hour stream.
[09:32.35]Lord of the Rings Return of the King.
[09:33.53]I'm not playing on hard.
[09:36.46]We're doing normal.
[09:38.02]Here we go.
[09:39.24]Adventure MF Dan 5 community subs.
[09:40.88]Thank you, Dan.
[09:42.61]Play it on hard.
[09:43.79]Did you see how fucking horrible this game was the last one?
[09:47.63]You don't want me to do this on hard.
[09:48.87]I don't want to do this on hard.
[09:51.11]No.
[09:56.85]Why would I do that?
[09:58.73]I'm not gonna do that.
[10:01.13]Here we go.
[10:01.49]Lord of the Rings.
[10:02.21]The Return of the King.
[10:03.45]We last left our heroes...
[10:06.09]When they were having a good time and... Okay.
[10:09.89]Of course, it's a fucking THX!
[10:12.39]At the beginning of the... THX-certified game.
[10:16.89]Good.
[10:22.13]Did it break the speakers?
[10:26.69]You did the THX sound too loud.
[10:28.61]You broke the speakers.
[10:32.28]Do you ever think the guy in the projection room during the THX sound is going like, oh fuck, oh fuck, it's gonna happen?
[10:45.35]Now what?
[10:45.83]Why is this so soft?
[10:48.14]Come on, Batman, thanks for the 10 subs.
[10:51.72]I think it actually did break the speakers.
[10:53.86]Why this sounds like tinny?
[10:55.16]Does it sound tinny to anybody else?
[11:03.36]It sounds tinny.
[11:11.76]Why does it sound like it's coming down a hallway?
[11:20.32]It's actually broken.
[11:22.99]I can't even hear this.
[11:25.59]The power of the enemy is growing.
[11:31.79]My headphones weren't plugged in all the way.
[11:36.09]It's been a week, guys.
[11:37.53]Here we go, another full movie.
[11:39.58]What's this?
[12:04.27]Here comes the DM.
[12:06.61]No, don't DMCA.
[12:07.81]This is a cutscene in the game.
[12:09.11]Yeah, this is when we last left our heroes at the Battle of Home Depot.
[12:36.04]You know what's funny about this stream?
[12:38.46]I'm gonna be really honest with you.
[12:40.96]The only reason why I'm playing this is because I bought it.
[12:45.21]I didn't want to play this.
[12:49.49]But I can't not play it.
[12:53.06]I bought all three of them together.
[13:00.88]Somebody do that.
[13:03.10]Somebody do it!
[13:03.62]Do it!
[13:04.08]Do late!
[13:05.08]That's the line right there.
[13:06.14]That's actually the line.
[13:11.32]Streamer is never late nor is he early.
[13:14.16]He arrives precisely when he accidentally forgets to eat and might have a shit building up in him for three hours and can't start on time.
[13:29.20]Seamless transition.
[13:31.14]Let's go.
[13:34.07]I get to play as Gandalf, too.
[13:43.93]I already leveled up.
[13:47.74]I'm already in perfect mode.
[13:58.30]Alright, why does Gandalf look like the Star Wars kid?
[14:05.70]This guy is kind of flailing around.
[14:08.07]That was kind of fun.
[14:15.29]What does that thing made of?
[14:16.33]What's Gandalf's staff made out of?
[14:18.75]Wood?
[14:19.35]Is it wood?
[14:31.40]Well, I have to play as Gandalf the whole game.
[14:33.34]I don't care what any other character does.
[14:34.52]I probably would.
[14:43.65]Ranged.
[14:51.37]I'm gonna die!
[14:57.06]What the hell was I doing?
[15:02.03]Wait, blow it up from back here?
[15:07.07]Gandalf gameplay, ResidentSleeper.
[15:09.47]You mean Gandalf gameplay, guaranteed victory.
[15:13.26]I guess that is ResidentSleeper.
[15:17.34]Shit, you're right.
[15:19.52]I was wrong there.
[15:20.16]Alright, what am I doing?
[15:25.27]R1, action.
[15:28.89]I am coming, Aragog!
[15:32.07]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[15:32.71]Did I get it?
[15:39.09]Did I not get it?
[15:39.64]I just didn't hit anybody.
[15:45.52]What the fuck am I doing?
[15:49.16]Why is Gandalf throwing spears at me?
[15:55.98]I have magical powers.
[15:57.10]Why would I need to do this?
[15:59.52]Oh, there we go.
[15:59.96]Yeah, gotta get rid of that.
[16:05.80]I'm going to die.
[16:11.07]Can Gandalf die?
[16:16.57]Give us Frodo.
[16:17.46]Frodo's not even in this game.
[16:20.38]Return to your master, creatures of shadow.
[16:34.43]What do you mean?
[16:35.31]No, we don't give spoilers.
[16:37.15]No, we can talk spoilers.
[16:40.37]You've seen the last two movies.
[16:41.49]We've played them on stream.
[16:43.53]Sauron's wrath will be terrible.
[16:45.93]His retribution swift.
[16:51.59]Yes, I did.
[16:52.25]I played Fellowship of the Ring.
[16:53.95]And I played Two Towers on stream.
[16:55.53]We watched them.
[16:56.19]The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
[16:59.57]The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin.
[17:06.58]No one watched it, though.
[17:09.71]What do you mean, no one watched you?
[17:12.87]The skill meter determines the kill rating.
[17:14.57]Earn higher rating if I string it to get the successful hits.
[17:16.53]Best song in the... Best song... This song right here could potentially be the best song that has been written since, like, the 1700s.
[17:29.52]Fair ratings are the easiest to get, but generate the fewest experience points.
[17:39.63]Good and excellent ratings are worth more.
[17:41.33]Yeah, I know how to do that.
[17:42.39]We've seen the last movie.
[17:43.41]We already know how this works.
[17:48.54]Jerma won't read this comment.
[17:49.92]Well, now you owe me a thousand dollars.
[17:54.72]Was that on the line?
[17:55.36]I don't know.
[17:56.62]Pushing the skill meter into perfect will enhance your attack damage and generate maximum experience points.
[18:07.20]Hey.
[18:08.06]Hey, welcome back, guys.
[18:09.36]It's been a while.
[18:09.92]How you doing?
[18:13.06]I only got two perfects?
[18:14.02]How?
[18:19.51]So, are we... Is Gandalf... Is Gandalf ResidentSleeper?
[18:23.69]I'm not playing as Gimli again.
[18:24.69]He's the worst character in the game.
[18:28.51]Look at this.
[18:29.95]Oh, you can do it for all.
[18:33.74]You can do it for all.
[18:39.13]I know this is... We usually don't stop the stream for... A typical... When I say typical, I mean like a typical... Like one sub or one donation.
[18:52.18]We usually don't do that, but I have to stop here.
[18:56.92]Marvash Magali says, It's good seeing you play one of my childhood games.
[18:59.84]I completed this when I was 12.
[19:01.04]You better finish this.
[19:03.01]So...
[19:04.98]Thanks for the $2.50 though.
[19:06.58]I had to read that because... I've just been called out.
[19:17.50]So...
[19:26.64]15 hours stream.
[19:28.22]This is not going to be a 15 hour stream.
[19:30.84]You know why that is?
[19:31.78]This is important.
[19:32.38]I have to talk about this.
[19:33.00]I start physical therapy this week.
[19:36.38]If I lock myself in here for 15 hours today and I go to physical therapy, I'm going to have to explain to the doctor that I... How long have you been sitting in that chair?
[19:48.42]I usually six to seven hours.
[19:50.78]But you do stretches?
[19:52.42]Yeah, I try to.
[19:53.94]What about last night?
[19:54.72]15 hours?
[19:55.88]No.
[19:57.37]I'm not going to the doctor with that info.
[20:06.06]Just lie.
[20:13.88]Don't you know?
[20:14.38]What's that old saying?
[20:15.34]There's three people you don't lie to.
[20:18.16]Your doctor, your financial advisor, and your lawyer.
[20:24.21]And your wife.
[20:25.51]And your husband.
[20:26.37]It's a five.
[20:34.43]And your mother.
[20:35.39]And don't lie to your parents.
[20:38.19]Don't lie.
[20:38.71]No, just don't lie to anybody.
[20:43.47]Okay, alright.
[20:44.25]I gotta pay attention.
[20:46.47]6,900 points.
[20:47.69]Orc Hewer.
[20:50.08]I mean, this is just... Everybody needs this.
[20:53.12]XX.
[20:54.74]Yeah, this is a standard combo.
[20:59.92]It's cheaper for Gandalf, though.
[21:07.48]Yeah, I'm just playing.
[21:08.58]I want to play with Gandalf.
[21:09.84]Wait, hold on.
[21:12.14]You can play as the Hobbits?
[21:13.22]I don't remember that.
[21:13.88]That interests me for some reason.
[21:19.60]I don't know why.
[21:23.32]Okay.
[21:24.30]That's good.
[21:26.87]Replay, though.
[21:28.83]How do I get the hell out of here?
[21:33.17]How do I continue?
[21:33.97]I see continue down there.
[21:34.99]Do I have to go all the way down?
[21:38.93]Oh shit Play as Sam I'm probably gonna get my ass kicked if I play with Sam.
[21:51.87]I don't think I'm into that.
[21:52.95]I'll be honest
[22:02.23]The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men.
[22:08.98]His war on this country will come swiftly.
[22:13.10]He says his ring will draw close, and the strength of the Ringbearer will fail.
[22:23.47]Oh, let me get this on screen.
[22:25.35]It's great.
[22:26.75]Imagine somebody laughing at the Lord of the Rings movie like this.
[22:35.14]Here's- Oh, boy.
[22:37.04]Sad story.
[22:39.11]Somebody's entire- Imagine watching Lord of the Rings in the theaters.
[22:42.63]When people were screaming and cheering and yelling at every fucking other line.
[22:47.88]Somebody had their movie ruined, one of the best franchises ever, by being in the movie theater watching it, like, on launch.
[22:56.35]Still questions needed answering.
[22:59.06]Secrets only Minas Tirith, ancient city of men, could reveal.
[23:04.24]The year 3434 of the Second Age.
[23:07.40]Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor.
[23:14.27]Should I have to press a few beeps here to get this on screen?
[23:16.43]I just turned it off.
[23:17.27]I can't even see it.
[23:18.77]This is the future of movies, guys.
[23:44.44]In movie advertising.
[23:45.62]They're just not going to care anymore.
[23:48.91]Let me see that again.
[23:50.45]This is good.
[23:50.77]I like it.
[23:50.97]Alright, if I made this... Okay.
[23:52.21]If I made a streamer... Hold on.
[24:11.40]No one's done that shit.
[24:13.83]People sell fucking mice.
[24:15.89]Like, gaming keyboards.
[24:17.31]No, no, no.
[24:17.63]What if I sold a cologne?
[24:18.97]People need to branch out, man.
[24:22.21]It's not all about, like, your gamer chair.
[24:24.31]It's about, like, a nice fucking eau de toile.
[24:29.04]For they, like us, will be in great peril.
[24:36.35]Cologne that smells like me.
[24:37.53]No, that's strange.
[24:39.01]No, absolutely not.
[24:39.91]It would be a cologne that I would think would... That smells good.
[24:48.56]And that scent would be... It would be a combination of a couple things.
[24:51.14]It would be... Right when you pull open a green Jolly Rancher, that immediate scent that hits your nostrils.
[24:57.14]That would be in there somewhere.
[24:58.40]Like that green apple smell would be there.
[25:02.25]Surrounded by a nice oud.
[25:06.38]And then wood.
[25:08.06]Like a wood smell.
[25:09.25]Like a burning wood smell.
[25:12.25]You know that when a campfire's going, you get that wood burn smell?
[25:16.41]I think it would be pretty good.
[25:21.41]Alright, Path of the King.
[25:22.39]I think it's like a backwards level skill tree here.
[25:26.68]Escape from Osgiloth.
[25:28.04]Those of you guys who don't know what Ood is...
[25:35.74]OED.
[25:37.34]Undead series.
[25:38.74]People think... Don't tell me I'm crazy until you smell it.
[25:42.76]Food is an incredible smell.
[25:45.84]It's like one of the best scents ever made.
[25:47.60]It's incredible.
[25:49.28]OED.
[25:50.38]Smell it.
[25:53.00]Path of the Dead.
[25:55.36]Oh, is this the storyline that Peter Jackson wished he deleted from the whole entire movie?
[26:01.50]Let's do this one.
[26:08.56]Locked?
[26:09.26]Who are the other characters?
[26:10.90]There are three secret fucking characters?
[26:15.12]Why is Gandalf locked?
[26:17.21]I just unlocked him.
[26:39.84]He wasn't in that fight.
[26:41.27]Oh.
[26:42.05]It's because you have the trial version.
[26:43.63]This is the demo disk.
[26:46.15]Yeah, guys, sorry.
[26:46.65]I only got, like, the first two levels and two characters.
[26:59.88]Oh, by the way, I'm gonna play through this two-level demo a hundred times.
[27:04.16]Welcome to 1996.
[27:04.52]Imagine if I sold a fucking goddamn scent.
[27:06.72]I gotta look into this.
[27:31.03]I'm gonna look into this.
[27:32.13]That's funny to me.
[27:32.89]That's funny enough for me to set my eyes on it and lose a shitload of money and do it.
[27:38.05]Deep inside this haunted mountain, they will face terrible trials.
[27:44.54]They must overcome the wrath of an ancient, cursed realm and summon forth its king.
[27:52.69]Out of darkness, Aragorn must call an army even Sauron's horde cannot withstand.
[27:57.93]Call it Gerfume.
[27:59.35]No, that's weird.
[28:01.51]The living cannot defend Minas Tirith without the fury of those long dead.
[28:07.74]I'm going to call it Liquid Mold.
[28:10.02]The way is shut.
[28:11.10]You think anyone would spray it near their face?
[28:13.46]Dead keep it.
[28:15.02]The way is shut.
[28:16.02]Malice.
[28:21.80]Hold on!
[28:22.72]Just practicing!
[28:23.56]Oh yeah, you have no camera control on this, I forgot.
[28:27.70]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[28:28.74]The way is shut.
[28:29.82]It is made for those who are dead.
[28:48.44]Yeah, Peter Jackson wished he deleted this entire sequence, right?
[28:53.03]He hated this part.
[28:55.53]He was like, that's the biggest mistake of my whole career.
[29:01.11]No, he really said that.
[29:02.05]He actually talked about that.
[29:03.33]I swear to God.
[29:13.01]He actually just hit me.
[29:23.58]Oh, what?
[29:23.98]I couldn't kill him?
[29:24.48]It's kind of hard to see.
[29:29.16]Jerma knows Peter Jackson.
[29:31.94]No, I just know of the YouTube video I clicked on that talked about in the article about how he didn't like this scene.
[29:38.83]And he didn't like this whole sequence.
[29:40.73]Come on, land.
[29:49.43]Land!
[29:56.70]Do something.
[29:58.32]Oh god.
[30:00.04]He never said that.
[30:00.82]Yes he did.
[30:05.16]Jesus.
[30:15.27]This is very ugly.
[30:16.51]Why is this uglier than the last one?
[30:19.43]Am I misremembering things or is this actually uglier than the second game?
[30:22.69]It's the same console.
[30:31.74]I feel like I'm watching a YouTube playthrough of this game that was uploaded in 2007.
[30:34.88]Is it not as bad as... Why does this look so bad?
[30:39.04]Alright, we need some blocks.
[30:40.34]Break this, right?
[31:05.05]Nice emulator.
[31:06.03]This is not on an emulator.
[31:07.35]This is on PlayStation 2, Slim Edition.
[31:12.85]I might actually turn it up.
[31:14.35]I think I'm actually going to go and do some adjustments.
[31:18.12]Alright, hold on.
[31:18.54]It's because it's dark.
[31:19.72]Alright, you got that image, right?
[31:21.64]Let's do some adjustments.
[31:28.31]Okay.
[31:28.91]Alright, looking better.
[31:35.62]A little bit more contrast.
[31:38.92]How's that saturation?
[31:39.88]A little bit deeper?
[31:40.56]That actually looks a lot better.
[31:55.85]Yeah, because this is where it was before.
[31:58.31]That's why it looks so fucking wrong.
[31:59.77]It's like dark.
[32:01.67]Had bad contrast.
[32:05.52]Hook it up with an HDMI, LOL.
[32:08.54]You think there's an HDMI on the back of my PlayStation 2 Slim Edition?
[32:16.21]Can I throw?
[32:16.81]Yeah, I can.
[32:17.35]How do I throw?
[32:24.49]You guys could, like, not watch me do this.
[32:26.69]And help.
[32:30.42]It's an upscaler?
[32:31.12]It's on an upscaler right now.
[32:34.24]I play all the old consoles through in Upscaler.
[32:39.52]So, I think it's kind of an ugly portion of the game.
[32:43.24]The first sequence didn't look like this.
[33:00.59]Like, the Battle of the Home Depot didn't look like this.
[33:10.26]Kill.
[33:10.60]This is the battle of lows now.
[33:17.78]Up.
[33:21.11]Up.
[33:23.57]Come on.
[33:23.83]Build up.
[33:24.25]Get some perfects.
[33:25.63]This is perfect cheesing.
[33:26.55]This is how you do it.
[33:28.00]Just stand in the middle and just bam.
[33:29.50]Square.
[33:32.16]Break his shield.
[33:45.79]You know what else it is?
[33:46.85]They're surrounded by this ugly goo.
[34:06.44]Yard sale.
[34:08.28]No, this is not a yard sale brawl.
[34:13.86]Why would a Yartill be in a cave?
[34:18.90]Yeah, that's the problem.
[34:24.19]There's no video game on the screen.
[34:25.73]There's just weird pixelated green water.
[34:34.95]Didn't I unlock a move?
[34:41.43]What is it?
[34:41.93]It's XXA.
[34:43.55]No, XX Triangle.
[34:45.87]Didn't I unlock it for everybody?
[34:46.97]Did I just grab the ring?
[34:55.50]Alright, uh... Can I put one of you guys on this?
[35:13.73]No, don't mind.
[35:14.33]Just go ahead.
[35:15.09]Go on, guys.
[35:17.37]I'll just do fucking everything.
[35:19.18]Dude, they're just up there vibing.
[35:28.42]Get the fuck down here.
[35:30.30]Oh, God.
[35:41.51]Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.
[35:53.01]Let's go.
[35:53.50]Build it up.
[36:01.88]Did I get it?
[36:02.38]Got it.
[36:02.60]I can't even get over there.
[36:16.88]I get, finally.
[36:19.22]I can't even go over here!
[36:24.30]Nice PS2 Slim Edition.
[36:27.82]Don't make... The PS2 Slim Edition is an amazing console.
[36:30.44]It could literally fit anywhere.
[36:33.56]You know the weird places I had to put this fucking thing?
[36:35.72]When I was in my bedroom.
[36:40.79]This thing could fit anywhere.
[36:48.84]The PS2 Slim Edition is as big as, like, eight credit cards.
[36:53.14]It can go anywhere.
[37:01.16]Can we move?
[37:06.78]Did you put it in a Ziploc bag or something?
[37:08.44]No, but you could stuff this somewhere behind, like, a bureau.
[37:13.10]It'd fit everywhere.
[37:15.95]You go under your desk.
[37:17.84]You go on top of your desk.
[37:19.34]What is this camera angle?
[37:22.28]What the fuck is this camera?
[37:31.05]I don't even know what's happening.
[37:33.13]I think I'm winning.
[37:45.03]Grimpa, please.
[37:45.95]Stop.
[37:46.19]You're making chat.
[37:46.89]What?
[37:47.01]What are you talking about?
[37:49.25]Is it clear on my end?
[37:50.31]No, not at all.
[37:58.88]Oh, there we go.
[37:59.52]Finally.
[38:05.00]Is it clear on your end?
[38:06.34]No, no, it's not.
[38:07.50]It looks like your end.
[38:13.44]Bureau is French for desk.
[38:15.27]Yeah, that's what I called it.
[38:16.09]Am I weird for saying the word bureau now?
[38:19.93]How much should I charge for the clone?
[38:22.09]Should it be something stupid so nobody buys it?
[38:24.41]No, I do have a combo.
[38:48.81]I could do without it popping up on the screen every time.
[38:56.15]Probably $20.
[38:56.67]You don't think it should be like $80?
[38:59.30]I'm only going to make like 10 of these.
[39:09.00]Are you sure you don't want me to have articles written about me?
[39:11.73]Like, streamer is such an egomaniac.
[39:13.57]He has a $120 cologne that he's selling.
[39:18.32]I mean, that's publicity for the community.
[39:36.10]Ego maniac.
[39:38.86]I wonder how many bottles I could reliably actually get manufactured.
[39:45.66]Look, if you buy one of these colognes, you'll... They last a long time.
[39:52.03]Guys, I've bought cologne that I still have since high school.
[40:05.41]I swear to God.
[40:13.49]15-year-old cologne.
[40:14.32]More than that...
[40:16.82]Try, like, 20.
[40:17.42]What the fuck is going on right now?
[40:20.24]What?
[40:20.48]Am I dead?
[40:22.24]I just got, like, trapped in the corner.
[40:26.57]Nice, Aragon.
[40:28.27]Good job.
[40:29.51]Good work, Aragon.
[40:30.81]Or Legolas, whichever one of you.
[40:32.83]Good job.
[40:34.23]You're doing great.
[40:49.62]Give me a break.
[40:52.50]This is why we need you to be Sam.
[40:56.50]Am I gonna be the first person that beats this game as Samwise?
[41:05.05]Does he even have any combos?
[41:06.25]Does Sam have a combo?
[41:12.13]I feel like... So Triangle is Fierce Attack, X is... Light Attack.
[41:17.76]Square is Parry, right?
[41:19.66]Why do I feel like he's gonna have a stab with X, and then an... Instead of any other moves.
[41:27.30]Like it'll be... I can make him say, ooh.
[41:38.19]Get in here and help.
[41:41.74]There was a funny ooh noise.
[41:43.00]Thank you.
[41:43.78]Make sure you buy a cologne on your way out.
[41:47.12]They're only $100.
[41:57.09]All fair.
[42:00.03]Ooh, what's this?
[42:08.03]What is this?
[42:08.43]Is it a rock?
[42:14.62]Oh, that's what we needed to do.
[42:17.64]Cool.
[42:20.98]I remember playing this level when I was younger, and having perfect almost the entire time I played.
[42:28.70]How the fuck did I do that?
[42:33.87]That almost seems... Like, not even achievable.
[42:41.57]Dude, that was pretty good.
[42:48.42]Dude, almost there.
[42:49.17]Come on!
[42:51.77]Oh, you idiots.
[42:53.69]I had it.
[42:57.99]Normal is easy.
[43:00.40]Yeah, that's true.
[43:01.46]Hey, Jerma sucks.
[43:02.78]Thanks for saying I suck.
[43:04.36]Thanks for the vibe community sucks subs.
[43:06.86]Thank you.
[43:12.53]How do we get out of here?
[43:18.07]Knock him down.
[43:23.93]Thanks for the subs.
[43:33.68]Oh, here's the thing.
[43:34.18]Okay, let's say I make this Cologne.
[43:36.38]I know I'm on the Cologne thing, but you gotta give me, just give me a second.
[43:40.17]Let's say I make this cologne and it turns out like holy shit.
[43:42.09]That's actually what a combination of scents.
[43:44.61]This is fucking fantastic.
[43:46.13]This is actually really good and I don't know some celebrity gets a hold of it.
[43:52.22]Should I just sell the rights to them like a million dollars?
[44:06.20]They can just like change the name.
[44:08.14]Whatever.
[44:10.27]And then I can hire Danny DeVito to be in his skin.
[44:14.86]That's the long con here.
[44:17.26]That's the long game here, guys.
[44:31.45]That's a sellout move.
[44:32.61]No, stop.
[44:33.79]Alright.
[44:38.08]Come on.
[44:38.42]Perfect.
[44:42.93]Perfect!
[44:45.85]It's like there's not enough of them for me to get perfect.
[44:47.79]It is on normal, though, that's right.
[44:50.07]Or is it at a right point?
[44:51.59]Come on.
[45:06.12]Or fewer.
[45:08.42]Good, G-Face.

[47:02.70]You guys are worse than the last co-op.
[47:10.60]Is Legolas dead?
[47:16.12]This game is awesome.
[47:19.19]Yeah, they're both really good.
[47:30.17]Lord of the Rings and the return of the king.
[47:33.21]I keep looking over on the other monitor to see that Oh, did you see that?
[47:44.50]Oh, you didn't.

[49:45.19]No, no, it was this.
[49:46.25]Okay.
[49:50.93]I never looked for that shit.
[49:52.87]This is ever since I started streaming on Twitch.
[49:56.35]I see them now.
[50:00.89]I never even thought for a second...
[50:04.96]But that was something to look for.
[50:05.94]Alright, let's go.
[50:17.23]Who should I put my points into?
[50:18.29]Did you just say Gimli is your main?
[50:21.53]I know, I said Gimli is not my main.
[50:30.87]Game concept art.

[50:36.17]We have to watch all of these.
[50:39.81]So, hold on.
[50:40.49]So this is the concept art for the game.
[50:43.92]Not concept art for the movie.
[50:46.44]Oh, that's bright.
[50:51.04]Oh my god, this is horrible.
[50:52.46]Something's wrong with the capture here.
[51:02.64]It's really not right at all.
[51:07.83]Fix the gamma?
[51:08.59]No, it's... Hold on a second.
[51:09.87]I think it's... Ooh, ooh, ooh!
[51:13.39]Whoa, hold on.
[51:14.05]Something's not right here.
[51:20.69]What's going on with this shit?
[51:21.69]Why is it doing this?
[51:22.33]Alright, hold on.
[51:26.22]Let me turn this off for a second.
[51:27.24]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[51:33.50]I don't know what's going on.
[51:43.55]Wait, does that look better?
[51:45.37]By hell, let me go back in here now.
[51:50.91]I don't know what's going on with this thing.
[51:55.31]Did it make it worse?
[52:03.22]The cables are bad?
[52:04.26]How the fuck did that happen?
[52:06.60]I've been gone for eight days.
[52:07.74]What, did they rot while I was gone?
[52:24.44]Hold on.
[52:26.62]Is that better?
[52:28.90]Maybe a little bit.
[52:32.20]King of the Dead, the Southern Gate.
[52:34.30]No, I gotta do all of them, right?
[52:35.24]Yeah.
[52:38.07]Road to Isengard.
[52:41.31]Something's fucking wrong here.
[52:43.55]Ooh, I get to be Gandalf.
[52:44.99]Actually, it looks a little better, though.
[52:48.83]So, um, I took the cable and I bent it and twisted it and pulled on it.
[52:54.04]I'm not gonna touch it anymore.
[53:03.01]I'm being Gandalf.
[53:15.00]Table and ball torture.
[53:17.20]It was not mere chance that brought Merry and Bippin to Fangorn Forest.
[53:22.25]Run, Merry!
[53:26.99]It's talking, Merry.
[53:28.11]The tree is talking.
[53:29.47]Tree?
[53:31.77]I am no tree.
[53:34.95]I am an ant.
[53:36.14]The ants have not troubled about the wars of men and women.
[53:48.87]I love the word wizard.
[53:49.93]Might be my favorite word.
[54:06.95]This is pirate quality.
[54:08.83]This really, I really should just title this like Lord of the Rings Lord underscore of underscore the underscore rings underscore like x2114 rip part one dot zip.
[54:18.96]It does look like a torrented movie.
[54:36.01]Actually, it does look better.
[54:36.83]That guy got fucking destroyed.
[54:44.53]Imagine being the first guy that runs alone to Gandalf.
[54:48.50]It'd be like, oh boy, you're done.
[54:49.96]Christopher Lee.
[54:58.94]Yeah, what a... I love Christopher Lee.
[55:06.10]That guy was running.
[55:07.12]Smart.
[55:10.74]Get that guy up there.
[55:12.22]No, I just... I blew that guy's head off.
[55:15.88]Gandalf, that was fucked up.
[55:17.14]I'm trying to shoot the guy up here.
[55:18.28]I just point blank that guy's head.
[55:22.92]Hold on, can I... Yes, I can.
[55:29.51]Why would I even ask?
[55:44.41]Here we go.
[55:45.31]Let's get up here.
[55:45.83]Come on.
[55:46.37]Is that Gandalf?
[55:48.83]I don't know why I thought that was Gandalf talking.
[55:54.41]There he is.
[55:56.17]Well, he's like, easy pickets back there.
[55:57.38]Get him.
[55:57.84]I was currently going, going and getting.
[56:14.26]It sounded kind of like Gandalf.
[56:23.45]And don't tell me I'm crazy, because all video game voice acting is either we got the money to- Ooh!
[56:29.77]Hold on a second!
[56:33.06]Come on, somebody!
[56:34.78]I'm in perfect mode, how dare you!
[56:36.70]Come on!
[56:37.28]No!
[56:37.70]How dare you do this to me!
[56:40.14]Fuck you.
[56:50.02]Where am I?
[56:50.86]What I was gonna say is... You either have the real actor there and you have the money for it, or... The guy from accounting does Gandalf.
[56:59.60]He's gonna stomp.
[57:12.82]I need perfects here.
[57:13.52]Get out of the way.
[57:24.85]Get the fuck out of here.
[57:30.55]You guys are blocking the screen.
[57:44.96]Gandalf's got a really good orc healer.
[57:46.06]Come on.
[57:50.89]Spring it, spring it, spring it.
[57:52.93]Nothing?
[57:57.89]Ow.
[58:06.00]Bingo.
[58:09.56]No, get the fuck away from me.
[58:10.65]I got this, I got this, I got this.
[58:11.71]Leave me alone.
[58:13.86]Oh, come on.
[58:23.49]Ooh, there it is again.
[58:24.93]Thanks for stepping on me over and over again.
[58:30.92]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[58:33.00]Those trees are an ancient madness.
[58:36.46]They require burning before they destroy all who live near them.
[58:48.70]Let's go, come on!
[58:50.08]Get this out!
[58:57.81]What?
[58:57.95]Who the fuck are you aiming?
[59:07.24]Star Wars wizard.
[59:09.10]Is there any game that you can use?
[59:13.76]Hold on.
[59:19.09]Had to just get that nice and clean.
[59:23.59]Should I play Jedi Fallen Order?
[59:26.00]Somebody please tell me the truth.
[59:28.24]Like, I love lightsabers and I love Dark Souls games.
[59:31.62]Like, how would I not like that game?
[59:34.28]Is it really bad enough where you're like, no, no, no, no.
[59:37.10]It's like, suck.
[59:38.56]That ticks every box for me.
[59:53.27]Fallen Order is good.
[59:54.27]One person just said it.
[59:54.99]Do I believe him?
[59:57.54]Wait a minute.
[59:58.86]Do I believe that person?
[60:06.79]Believe that person.
[60:07.93]Okay.
[60:08.87]Fuck that guy.
[60:09.69]Don't... Hey, come on.
[60:10.47]That's... You guys are sitting on the same train here.
[60:20.11]You're not sitting on the subway and somebody gets off at a stop and you go, ah, fuck that stop, fuck that guy.
[60:27.48]We're on the same train.
[60:39.48]Oh shit, I didn't even see, this guy's like popped in.
[60:48.62]Sitting on the scam train.
[61:05.94]No, just excellent.
[61:07.16]Might as well not even fucking try then.
[61:08.81]Not even worth tweeting about.
[61:15.71]Really?
[61:18.23]What the fuck?
[61:18.97]Where am I supposed to go?
[61:19.93]No, it's going to do the camera change bullshit.
[61:33.25]Sorry, got it.
[61:35.65]I'm actually playing pretty well.
[61:36.69]Remember last time I played this game?
[61:40.39]I think the multivitamin's working!
[61:50.36]I started taking like a little voltmul- the voltimitamin recently, and I think it's working!
[62:03.54]Voldemort gummies?
[62:07.14]That's never getting sent.
[62:14.29]I'll take a perfect.
[62:17.81]I'll take a perfect.
[62:19.65]I'll take a... Will you?
[62:29.01]Will you do that, Gandalf?
[62:31.93]Gandalf, is that what you're doing?
[62:41.62]Gandalf, is that what we're doing here?
[62:43.28]I don't know.
[62:43.78]I don't think that's what we're doing here.
[62:46.74]I thought that just said overachiever on it.
[62:48.74]I was like, why are you calling me an overachiever?
[62:52.91]How do I... What, I put the end out?
[62:55.05]How do I save him?
[62:55.81]I don't know what to do.
[62:58.49]I can't hit it.
[62:59.01]Oh, I just have to protect him.
[63:09.29]I didn't even see the archers on my cell phone camera, sorry.
[63:23.49]Gandalf, best character, seriously.
[63:25.47]Why would I ever play another character?
[63:38.73]Anybody else?
[63:39.63]Take it.
[63:39.95]Come on, go.
[63:45.33]Sam.
[63:45.87]Sam.
[63:46.43]Sam.
[63:48.54]But why would I want to play Sam when I can play as Gandalf?
[63:58.14]Sam gang.
[63:58.94]Sam gang.
[63:59.58]Sam gang.
[64:00.20]Sam gang.
[64:01.02]Alright, I will play as Sam.
[64:02.86]I will.
[64:10.40]You get it?
[64:10.78]Okay, I don't know what's going on.
[64:20.68]I just started laughing about the cow throwing the rock in black and white.
[64:25.49]It's happening a lot.
[64:27.81]I'll be out to dinner with Kim, and I'll just think of... And then the rock getting thrown.
[64:33.05]And I don't know why.
[64:35.33]It's fucking crazy.
[64:58.07]Wait a minute, what's this?
[64:59.31]We have an important message here.
[65:01.97]Let me see what this is.
[65:08.54]Hey everyone, fucking listen.
[65:09.64]For the love of God, do not buy the $5 Biggie bag from Wendy's.
[65:13.50]If you purchase the standard 4-4 and add bacon, it comes to $4.50.
[65:16.77]They're scamming you.
[65:18.17]Instead, upgrade your fries to a large and your total will be $5.00.
[65:23.61]I don't even know what that means.
[65:24.77]I have not been to Wendy's in probably like six months.
[65:37.17]I'm a McDonald's guy.
[65:38.91]You guys know that.
[65:42.07]I'm a McDonald's guy.
[65:51.26]If I had fast food, me and Kim.
[65:53.43]Kim is the same way.
[65:54.19]Kim's a McDonald's girl.
[65:55.25]I'm a McDonald's guy.
[65:58.55]Number one.
[66:00.23]I'm sorry.
[66:00.65]That's just the way it is.
[66:08.90]McDonald's is dog food.
[66:10.06]No, it's not.
[66:10.58]It's great.
[66:12.39]It's good.
[66:13.09]McChicken is fucking perfect.
[66:14.73]The number one is really good.
[66:16.81]McDonald's is... I like McDonald's.
[66:19.49]I think when... It's more comfortable for me to eat at McDonald's.
[66:22.03]Wendy's might be higher quality food, but I like McDonald's better.
[66:25.09]I don't care.
[66:28.04]It's... I like it.
[66:35.46]How much did they pay you?
[66:36.70]If you really think that McDonald's needs to pay somebody...
[66:40.70]To talk about how they like the Big Mac.
[66:43.58]I mean... There's like 16,000 McDonald's stores.
[66:48.50]They're doing just fine.
[66:50.66]They don't need my help.
[66:54.19]A McDonald's hamburger is sold every tenth of a second in this country.
[66:59.19]They don't need my help.
[67:00.25]They don't need to pay me for that.
[67:01.57]The people are going to eat there.
[67:02.47]Alright, what should we do?
[67:05.71]Final Judgment?
[67:06.15]Final Judgment?
[67:15.82]It's garbage food.
[67:17.04]You're killing yourself.
[67:20.80]Have you ever listened to Benjamin Franklin's podcast?
[67:27.31]All Things in Moderation.
[67:31.21]He would have had a great podcast, don't you think?
[67:35.17]I think Ben Franklin would have been the Joe Rogan.
[67:38.21]Don't you think so?
[67:40.19]He would have the microphone set up.
[67:41.99]He'd be bringing in people.
[67:50.51]Let me buy something.
[68:00.08]I need to get this.
[68:00.96]I feel like I'm wasting money.
[68:03.42]Should I upgrade Gandalf?
[68:04.92]This is... Just do it for everybody.
[68:08.23]X. The dude came up with electricity.
[68:18.47]You can't... I know what Tesla... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[68:20.93]But Benjamin Franklin got struck by lightning first.
[68:23.49]And he lived.
[68:25.21]At least that's what the cartoon told me.
[68:31.43]I'm going to get this because this is very important for everyone to have this.
[68:35.30]It's incredibly important.
[68:43.12]And do I have enough?
[68:43.80]I have enough to give to everybody.
[68:44.70]Just give it to everybody.
[68:45.66]I'm spreading it all around.
[68:54.84]This looks good.
[68:59.07]It's like a knockdown.
[69:01.75]I'll do the kill.
[69:04.75]X, circle, R2.
[69:06.19]Alright, that's good.
[69:22.74]Okay.
[69:24.28]You sound like you're reading a menu at a restaurant.
[69:28.90]Am I picking skills?
[69:29.94]Now, I know exactly what I want.
[69:40.89]See, I pre-order at every restaurant I go to.
[69:49.02]What that means is every restaurant has their menus online now.
[69:53.11]I go find out what I want.
[69:54.95]I know what I want when I get in.
[69:56.07]I don't have to ask any questions.
[70:01.69]So then it's not a question of sitting there for 20 minutes while I try to figure out what the hell you want to eat.
[70:06.30]I kind of have to watch this, don't I?
[70:11.56]The world is changing.
[70:14.90]Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
[70:25.01]What I'm doing today is I've been providing the voice of Saruman in the game.
[70:30.99]Saruman the White was the head of the Order and he thinks that he can be the Lord of the Rings.
[70:37.42]We must join with Saruman.
[70:39.58]The power of Saruman lies in his voice.
[70:41.96]Absolutely legendary.
[70:43.02]None can contend with the will of Saruman.
[70:45.28]He's not just a wizard who can do extraordinary things.
[70:48.25]He can convince the most unlikely people.
[70:51.53]This is the impression, you see, that he gives.
[70:54.53]All powerful.
[70:56.35]What a professional.
[70:57.73]What an absolute professional.
[71:00.19]But you know, if you do the right things, you can beat me.
[71:02.71]If you do the wrong things, you are the losers.
[71:10.79]Is Viggo Mortensen in this game?
[71:13.75]I hope so.
[71:14.33]Alright, we can go to the King of the Dead.
[71:17.07]No, we don't.
[71:18.63]We have to do... Wait, didn't we?
[71:19.85]Yeah, we're gonna go up.
[71:22.53]Escape from Ozgaloth.
[71:23.77]You know, we can do it all.
[71:24.53]Whatever.
[71:24.79]We're doing it all.
[71:36.23]That was violent.
[71:37.69]Sam.
[71:40.09]Isn't Sam a chef?
[71:41.41]Well, I guess you know how to cut stuff.
[71:47.39]My heart is filled with both great hope and sadness.
[71:51.38]With the success of our plan, I must place the smallest of us in the greatest of peril.
[71:59.50]Always the mighty tried to possess the ring, and always they failed.
[72:07.51]Fate has lent me a hobbit.
[72:10.21]Resilient to the ring's corruption and brave by his very nature.
[72:16.19]I want to watch these movies.
[72:17.36]You cannot stay in the Shire.
[72:18.78]No.
[72:19.56]Blasher Wood's awesome, too.
[72:20.92]Like, this is just an all-awesome cast.
[72:23.34]Like, everybody is so good.
[72:25.48]...start hard to bear the ring.
[72:28.14]He will need a companion.
[72:30.90]What have you done?
[72:32.88]And a guide who knows the ways of the enemy.
[72:38.01]Alright, I'm gonna how many people are in this community like a few hundred thousand I'll rent out a football stadium and we'll just put it on a big screen and everyone's invited we'll do that You know the way
[73:06.85]Imagine.
[73:10.24]That was like 40 million dollars to get the licensing to do that.
[73:15.46]To watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a stadium.
[73:23.45]Wow.
[73:26.97]I hire a... Like a LARPing crew to do every scene on the football field while the movie is playing.
[73:36.11]So you get two at the same time.
[73:51.94]Make it happen.
[73:52.72]Anybody have a hundred million dollars that they don't need anymore?
[73:55.02]That they'd like to just have disappear?
[73:56.78]Alright, let's go Alright, I'm just slashing at random people
[74:18.14]Oh, he's supposed to be following you.
[74:19.30]Can you block?
[74:23.34]By the way, all you guys that said, like, -2... He's doing it.
[74:39.17]That is the... button for him.
[74:55.23]Does he have Orc Cure?
[74:56.03]Does he even have Orc Cure?
[75:03.63]What is it?
[75:03.95]It's, uh... It's what?
[75:10.92]X... He has it, right?
[75:12.42]Doesn't he?
[75:13.90]It's... It's X-Circle... X-Circle R2.
[75:20.06]X-Circle R2?
[75:26.22]Oh, he's level 1.
[75:27.02]He can't do it.
[75:28.46]Oh, alright.
[75:34.78]Why can't we just... Okay.
[75:36.66]Can we not trade swords?
[75:40.87]Like, this is just the... You don't want to take it from your friend.
[75:43.89]But if your friend has the legendary, don't you think you should put it in the hands of the person that knows how to attack?
[75:51.17]It's useless in your hands right now.
[76:00.06]It's soulbound.
[76:00.86]Yeah, well, you shouldn't have pressed need on it, but I'm not going to give you shit for it.
[76:04.68]We can't talk about World of Warcraft every single time we play a game with swords in it, alright?
[76:10.64]I'm not going to talk about it anymore.
[76:18.19]Yep.
[76:26.45]I didn't even have to do anything.
[76:28.87]Ow.
[76:38.78]Ooh, that was... We just both hit each other at the same time.
[76:40.82]Down!
[76:41.25]Now!
[76:45.60]Dame is the best character?
[76:46.60]We'll see.
[76:48.00]We'll see.
[76:50.14]I'm not sure if I agree with that statement, but... I mean, he did win the Academy Award, so you're kind of right.
[77:11.34]Yeah, actual Academy Award.
[77:13.39]It was him.
[77:14.91]He got it.
[77:24.67]I didn't even notice the dragon.
[77:25.67]Well, I did before, but you know, I didn't know the dragon was still here.
[77:28.63]Does this happen in the movie?
[77:33.77]Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[77:34.59]Come on, let's get Sam some perfects.
[77:35.85]I need the XP.
[77:48.70]This was cut from the movie.
[77:58.92]That was a cool move.
[78:01.22]Fire it!
[78:05.26]He does have the Orc Healer.
[78:11.66]I don't like Sam's Orc Healer.
[78:12.79]It's too fancy.
[78:15.39]I don't like that.
[78:16.07]It takes him too long to do it.
[78:18.23]I'm not playing with him.
[78:18.87]I don't care.
[78:20.89]I'm playing with Gandalf.
[78:21.79]Fuck it.
[78:33.85]I'm leaving?
[78:36.09]Really?
[78:38.31]I can't even see who's shooting.
[78:43.52]Gandalf hits twice with his orc healer.
[78:45.26]He spins around and swings once.
[78:46.62]It's not very good.
[78:57.53]Why are the hobbits as tall as the orcs?
[79:02.20]Looks like we're going up the ladder to the Cleric Beast.
[79:04.56]I'll take that one because that's an actual good reference.
[79:07.01]I don't care what anybody says.
[79:07.97]That was a great fucking reference.
[79:09.85]One of the best I've made in probably the last few months.
[79:11.66]I don't care.
[79:29.27]You've ruined it.
[79:30.53]I know.
[79:30.83]That's the... Wasn't that kind of the point?
[79:33.77]What?
[79:42.90]What just happened?
[79:46.32]What's the timer?
[79:52.38]Oh, the dragon comes back.
[79:53.70]I see.
[79:54.04]Okay.
[79:59.16]It was a +2, then you acknowledged it and turned it into a minus four.
[80:04.10]Well, we'll see what the other judges have to say at the end of the boxing match.
[80:08.92]I want the help.
[80:16.47]There's always that one judge that's a real asshole.
[80:31.03]Aragorn is getting his ass kicked.
[80:42.54]Remember, we all did -2.
[80:46.34]Yeah, but you're... There's two other judges.
[80:50.34]My mother watches these streams.
[80:52.26]I'll text her later.
[80:52.91]What do you think about that thing I said about the authorities?
[80:56.70]Honey, it was so good.
[80:58.03]It's always a +2 from mom, by the way.
[81:01.13]So, sorry.
[81:01.69]Let me get some purpose.
[81:16.93]Ring the bell?
[81:32.13]Did I do it again?
[81:32.65]How many bells can I throw down there?
[81:50.52]I have to help Aragorn.
[81:52.34]Is that even Aragorn or am I- do I have this wrong?
[81:54.40]No wait, is that Aragorn?
[81:55.64]Hold on.
[81:56.00]Why are there two Aragorns?
[82:17.22]You're a fake fan?
[82:18.60]No, this is the same person.
[82:28.28]That's the same character model.
[82:41.55]Oh look, there's Aragorn again.
[82:45.20]Is that just, like, the default, like, human model?
[82:48.18]He looks like Eragon.
[82:53.51]That's a broken back.
[82:56.43]Holy shit.
[83:01.31]I hope you got the... I hope you land the arrow.
[83:03.79]Alright, we... Are we good?
[83:21.31]Dragon's coming back!
[83:32.14]I gotta go!
[83:33.66]Where is he?
[83:35.52]Oh god, he's coming back!
[83:39.98]What?
[83:42.42]Frodo gonna kill the dragon?
[83:56.12]You can't be up to... Okay, right.
[83:57.45]You can't be up top when the timer reaches zero.
[84:03.29]No!
[84:07.93]That's not that far back, right?
[84:14.73]It's actually pretty far back.
[84:17.75]Alright, well now, like, just get out of the way.
[84:22.91]It takes you too long.
[84:32.81]It takes too long.
[84:33.61]I'm just going to default swing.
[84:35.07]It takes too long.
[84:36.73]Unless I get to perfect, which I might.
[84:42.28]Alright, let's go.
[84:54.47]Alright, he's back.
[84:57.51]He's back.
[84:57.81]I gotta get out of here.
[85:00.33]We go down?
[85:01.85]Does this count as hiding?
[85:07.29]I feel like he came over here before.
[85:08.97]Right, so if I'm over here... So he's gone.
[85:16.65]Okay.
[85:19.57]For the love of God.
[85:21.75]Golem, can you fucking bite somebody's leg?
[85:36.12]Stab him!
[85:42.75]I'm trying.
[85:43.23]There's health back here, though.
[85:45.19]Alright, let's go.
[85:48.09]Not this insanity again.
[85:49.87]No, this is not going to be insane.
[85:52.39]No.
[85:53.03]It's not going to be insane.
[85:53.85]I have confidence that I will get... This will be a normal strength.
[86:01.48]Normal.
[86:03.36]Normal.
[86:09.04]My mother's watching.
[86:10.96]This is her favorite movie ever.
[86:14.17]She saw the notifications.
[86:15.07]She texted me.
[86:15.59]She's like, wait, hold on.
[86:16.83]The movie?
[86:17.53]Like, yeah.
[86:18.75]She's like, my favorite movie?
[86:20.20]Like, yes, mom.
[86:21.80]I have to be on my best behavior.
[86:38.36]Yeah, you guys, you too.
[86:44.40]You know she can read the chat.
[86:45.54]Is there health over here?
[86:54.90]Yes, there is.
[86:57.49]When's the next crack stream?
[87:00.87]You tell me.
[87:01.69]When do you guys think you're going to smoke your next crack?
[87:04.67]I don't know.
[87:05.13]I can't tell you that.
[87:20.46]The game definitely looks better, too.
[87:21.62]I don't know.
[87:22.18]I just grabbed the cables and shook them so it worked.
[87:24.58]Alright, we gotta go.
[87:27.61]Let's go.
[87:29.31]Forget about it.
[87:29.87]Just move.
[87:31.99]I can't walk that way.
[87:41.94]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[87:45.58]Move.
[87:49.12]Move.
[87:53.81]Go!
[87:56.58]Go in, go in, go in, go in.
[87:59.22]Alright, we're outside.
[88:03.76]Jerma's dev is in chat.
[88:06.20]That's clever.
[88:07.62]That's pretty clever.
[88:08.28]Let's go.
[88:20.54]Three hits, does it kill?
[88:26.00]Kind of.
[88:26.50]Alright, are we safe over here?
[88:27.88]No, we're not.
[88:28.60]Just go to the next building.
[88:33.63]Did you actually hit me?
[88:34.49]I was ripping back and forth.
[88:36.07]I win.
[88:43.09]You have a lot of mobs.
[88:50.15]There's only one mom, and it's my mom, and that's it.
[88:56.77]Is there a ladder?
[88:57.21]Where's the ladder?
[88:59.99]Anybody see a ladder?
[89:04.80]Can you say go down?
[89:05.58]There it is.
[89:12.10]You can play as Gollum?
[89:13.04]That'd be awesome if you could.
[89:15.94]Just keep moving!
[89:24.97]Golem gang.
[89:28.63]I need health.
[89:29.85]Otherwise, ooh, not a good place I want to be.
[89:32.41]I don't have a checkpoint, so I can't focus up.
[89:34.15]I'm gonna really focus here.
[89:42.84]Okay.
[89:43.90]I can do it.
[89:44.80]I'm pretty good at that one.
[89:51.88]This place is flooded!
[89:57.40]This is real, boys.
[90:04.88]Jeremiah, are you available?
[90:06.64]Of course, I'm available.
[90:18.33]Really?
[90:24.58]Block, block, block, block, block, block, swing!
[90:28.19]Meets back on the menu.
[90:35.18]Ooh, full health.
[90:36.10]Yes.
[90:37.94]Alright, we got a big guy coming.
[90:44.42]What the fuck is this?
[90:50.07]Come on, bring it on.
[90:51.73]How many do we have?
[90:53.87]Ooh, that hurt a lot.
[91:00.63]Um, alright kill these guys first Don't knock me into the fucking god damn it it happened I took them both I got him in the back I think Holy shit, alright.
[91:22.02]No, I can't even hurt him
[91:27.71]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[91:29.77]Heavy attacks.
[91:31.23]Why did I have to... I'm so fucking mad.
[91:33.38]Why did I have to get knocked into the two healths?
[91:35.62]There's two full... And I'm all the way back at the beginning.
[91:41.82]Was there a checkpoint at the bottom of the sewer?
[91:43.85]Please tell me there was.
[91:48.49]Oh, fuck me.
[91:52.65]I'm just running.
[91:56.13]This course is two hells, and I'm just trying to... There's three guys to... I'm just running.
[91:59.59]I don't care.
[92:01.49]I don't care if I get a zero.
[92:11.81]I have to kill, like, a few people.
[92:13.45]Fuck!
[92:13.98]Why?
[92:15.22]This mission sucks.
[92:18.56]It's because I'm playing Sam.
[92:20.08]I could be playing as the most powerful wizard in the universe.
[92:25.25]We're not going to be the kind of potatoes!
[92:33.79]We must get off of these rooftops!
[92:46.54]Howie!
[92:47.94]Soft and quick as shadows we must be!
[92:54.73]Remember when Gandalf went through Osgiloth?
[93:09.12]I gotta get experience points for Sam.
[93:12.63]You're being a Sam hater.
[93:19.75]Well, that's okay.
[93:25.25]What are my thoughts on the Hobbit movies?
[93:26.95]Um... People hate those movies.
[93:30.07]I thought they were fine.
[93:30.89]I mean, they stretched... They stretched a book... As big as a Goosebumps book... Into three, four hour long movies.
[93:41.46]So that was probably a mistake.
[93:49.25]But, whatever.
[93:50.41]I think they're still enjoyable.
[93:53.93]I like Smaug.
[93:55.27]I think he's good.
[93:56.01]They're a little long, a little dragged out.
[93:59.10]I could still enjoy them.
[94:03.70]Do I love them?
[94:04.54]No.
[94:06.16]Would I choose to watch the Hobbit movies?
[94:08.60]Probably not.
[94:11.31]If I'm scrolling through Cable, and I land on...
[94:17.78]The Hobbit, and there's 45 minutes left in the movie?
[94:21.63]Yeah!
[94:22.23]Sure, I'll catch the end.
[94:23.85]Why not?
[94:34.10]Please get out of my way.
[94:36.48]Please get out of my fucking way.
[94:38.28]Don't even fucking think about it, seriously.
[94:42.52]Come on, don't even think about it.
[94:44.12]I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
[94:47.24]It's close.
[94:55.63]Let it cool down.
[94:58.31]But no, I wouldn't really choose to watch the Hobbit movies, but it's not... It's not like I hate them.
[95:22.25]He does hate them.
[95:23.49]No, he doesn't.
[95:24.09]Hold on, let me get through this.
[95:38.33]You just knocked him back up, dude.
[95:42.27]I don't really... Okay, the thing about movies... I don't really hate movies.
[95:50.33]I don't really.
[95:51.93]I hate video games.
[95:53.11]Like, you know what it is?
[95:54.29]Because I'm in control of the video game.
[95:57.05]And I feel like I'm being personally slighted when I, as my avatar, can't do something I'd like to do.
[96:03.37]Right?
[96:03.61]But a movie, I'm watching somebody else.
[96:05.75]I don't care.
[96:06.71]Like, if the movie sucks, whatever.
[96:07.83]I had nothing to do with it.
[96:12.17]If something bad happens to me in a game, I had something to do with it.
[96:16.92]But I don't hate movies, really.
[96:26.49]I can think movies aren't really good, but... No.
[96:31.85]There's no Surge 2 for me.
[96:33.31]Or Surge... No, I haven't played the Surge 2.
[96:34.93]There's no Surge... That's not even the worst game I think I've ever played, either.
[96:39.15]Like, why am I even saying that?
[96:40.35]It feels unfair.
[96:41.19]Alright, can you stop getting on the ladder?
[96:43.95]Alright, I gotta pay attention, because I'm not doing this again.
[96:48.06]Spies from Gondor!
[96:49.52]Get him!
[96:51.14]Easy meat, boys!
[97:00.79]The one time I don't swing swing you're just waiting for me to do it Okay, just I Got this two health packs up there Now I'm gonna try hard as Sam yes, I am I
[97:30.47]Come on.
[97:31.11]Don't.
[97:37.00]Okay.
[97:37.34]Alright.
[97:37.66]Alright.
[97:37.94]Alright.
[97:38.24]Easy.
[97:43.40]Oh, my God.
[97:44.93]I just tried to do a heavy attack, and he fucking, like, destroyed me.
[97:49.21]Give me the health.
[97:49.67]He will hurt us.
[97:53.17]He will hurt us.
[97:54.71]He will go.
[97:56.91]Okay.
[97:57.64]Okay.
[97:58.98]Okay.
[98:00.16]Okay.
[98:00.46]This is... This is a little ridiculous.
[98:16.94]Let's go!
[98:41.00]Level up!
[98:47.24]He's beginning to believe, yes!
[98:52.70]This is the end of the level too, that sucks.
[99:05.01]Have you made a reward to end the stream?
[99:08.23]150 000 channel points to end stream it's too risky isn't
[99:38.33]A million no, I don't want that.
[99:42.25]What if I have something big planned I
[100:05.12]Hey guys, here we are on a big stream that took a few weeks to make.
[100:08.81]Oh, turn the stream off.
[100:09.73]Okay.
[100:10.33]Bye.
[100:13.89]Let's turn it back on a second later.
[100:23.83]Do you know how much that fucks up with notifications and...
[100:27.69]It would just be bad.
[100:28.85]People would just leave and then I would delete a bunch of people because they probably wouldn't come back because they already got the notification.
[100:33.96]It would screw it.
[100:34.64]No, I'm never doing that.
[100:35.56]10,000?
[100:35.58]6.
[100:44.99]Alright, what does Sam get?
[100:48.63]I don't even want to put up...
[100:55.91]nice okay poison blade increases the time that a hobbit is hidden by using his elven cloak warriors bane Harry then instantly kill a man-sized enemy so everyone
[101:23.14]As opposed to a child-sized, hobbit-sized enemy?
[101:27.65]I don't understand.
[101:39.17]What do I have?
[101:40.17]12,000?
[101:40.81]Poison daggers.
[101:43.72]Strength of iron.
[101:44.44]Permanently increases your health.
[101:47.48]I'm not level 5.
[101:48.24]What do I got for all of them?
[101:53.36]Level 4.
[101:54.66]I could get this for everybody.
[102:06.98]Orcbane?
[102:09.45]Orc... Probably Orcbane, right?
[102:11.39]Get Orcbane for everyone.
[102:13.35]It's so important.
[102:15.23]It's just bang.
[102:15.97]It's instant.
[102:20.19]Yeah, just get it for everyone.
[102:22.09]You know what?
[102:22.41]I got some points.
[102:23.11]Let's do... People are going to be pissed off if I don't buy at least one thing for Sam.
[102:28.33]We'll do... We'll do the cloak.
[102:32.19]Let's see.
[102:32.55]All the... L1, R1, L2.
[102:34.13]Okay.
[102:43.24]Do an Orc Bane impression.
[102:47.18]I don't... Oh, I see what you're saying.
[102:51.16]Nah.
[102:52.16]Nah, I don't think so.
[102:52.92]I don't think so.
[102:57.88]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[103:06.67]Escape from Osgiloth.
[103:08.55]Alright, now we're in the main story here.
[103:11.85]Wait, we do have... Oh, we have a Sean Astin interview.
[103:14.83]Let's check it out.
[103:17.26]There's a lot in the movie where Sam is... The character himself is very... He's American?
[103:22.96]He gets sad a lot.
[103:25.00]There's a kind of comic relief element.
[103:28.62]Holy shit.
[103:45.40]His goodness and his decency is what makes him heroic and his bravery in the face of great danger.
[103:50.22]I'm going to Mordor alone.
[103:51.98]Of course you are.
[103:53.07]Bro, spoilers.
[103:54.35]And I'm coming with you.
[103:55.77]But because the game is sort of an action war game, the aspect of Sam's character that really comes through in the game is the kind of heroic fighting Sam.
[104:05.77]I get to really go and fight the orcs instead of having to, you know, pull up from stabbing them because it's a stunt guy who you don't want to hurt.
[104:13.42]You really feel like you're inside the movie, driving the movie.
[104:16.57]When I actually, for the first time, had a controller in my hands, I was looking at a very realistic likeness of myself.
[104:22.85]That's probably so crazy.
[104:23.81]And it reminded me of filming the scenes.
[104:25.51]It looked exactly like what we were filming on the sets, and it was totally interactive.
[104:29.25]You really feel like Sam.
[104:30.84]That's good.
[104:34.04]Alright, let's do The King of the Dead.
[104:49.38]I can't fucking believe I'm doing what I did last time.
[104:51.44]We're going to get to a level where I'm stuck for like two hours.
[104:53.38]And it was because I didn't pick Aragorn in the first level.
[104:58.56]Aragorn's path leads him through this terrible place.
[105:02.92]But a king of those long dead commands the fate of those not born.
[105:07.98]He must be forced to yield.
[105:10.40]Who enters my domain?
[105:13.78]One who would hold you to your oath.
[105:16.64]Boss?
[105:17.20]Boss fight.
[105:18.84]Wait, wasn't he just talking to Aragorn?
[105:31.21]Ooh, I almost had perfect there.
[105:48.15]Gimli sucks.
[105:49.74]No, he doesn't.
[105:52.84]It's just a little small.
[106:06.45]Come on.
[106:06.99]Alright, let's go.
[106:10.81]Bring it on.
[106:11.25]I need to get some perfects here.
[106:15.17]What?
[106:22.73]Come on, here it comes.
[106:23.93]Perfect.
[106:26.21]Come on, do it!
[106:28.53]Do it!
[106:31.71]Ah, unfortunate.
[106:39.25]Is there health anywhere?
[106:46.97]Uh oh.
[106:48.73]I see what you're doing over there.
[106:55.40]What are you throwing at Gimli?
[107:09.25]I don't even see where that was.
[107:20.41]He does that every time.
[107:21.27]I'm going to have to fight him again.
[107:41.68]You're wasting my perfect meter, dude.
[107:42.82]What?
[107:42.92]Oh, he's gonna do it again.
[107:44.56]I see.
[107:44.98]Uh-oh, it's like Space Invaders.
[107:48.21]Oh, shit.
[107:48.53]Dude, how many springs do you get?
[108:22.16]Is he gonna do it?
[108:22.94]He's gonna do the... Oh.
[108:28.06]No health.
[108:28.66]I'm in trouble.
[108:30.30]Oh.
[108:45.58]I'm so paranoid.
[108:51.70]Oh, got it.
[108:52.16]Nice.
[108:52.56]Alright, let's go.
[108:58.79]Bring it on.
[108:59.43]Bring it on.
[109:00.09]Bring it on.
[109:00.55]New commentary for the day.
[109:02.64]I fucking forgot again.
[109:24.33]What's he doing?
[109:24.77]Just another wave.
[109:32.70]Oh, shit.
[109:33.36]And his archers.
[109:36.40]Hey, he was off screen.
[109:47.25]That's not fair.
[109:55.64]How do you... How do you do, fellow warriors?
[109:58.86]That doesn't work here.
[110:00.12]That's so stupid.
[110:03.30]Why do they even read that?
[110:07.01]How do you do, fellow warriors?
[110:10.47]Ugh.
[110:12.05]What the fuck?
[110:12.81]Alright, I win.
[110:19.35]This is it.
[110:19.83]Don't go right in.
[110:20.61]He does the... Here we go.
[110:34.25]I win.
[110:45.55]What say you?
[110:48.14]I need you to come off the boat and be in the movie for 10 seconds in a battle.
[110:53.14]What say you?
[111:05.01]hurry everything collapses it's all coming down hurry oh Jesus no I'm slow
[111:24.57]Alright, if this is me, I have at least 10 or 15 axes that I have made for me.
[111:31.37]I am baseball swinging and throwing the axe off and running with both hands.
[111:34.63]I got extra axes, you know what I mean?
[111:37.18]Make sure you have at least 10 of these that I made.
[111:39.20]Oh, great.
[111:55.93]I can't see shit.
[111:58.33]Let me know where I am.
[112:06.16]Jesus!
[112:07.74]What the fuck?
[112:10.88]There's this fucking idiot over here that's messing the whole thing up.
[112:35.18]So who's winning?
[112:38.04]That's a good question.
[112:40.04]I think I am currently.
[112:44.76]We'll see in about 10 seconds if that's going to be the case.
[112:52.95]Dude.
[113:00.03]Jeremy, it's your mother.
[113:01.05]Please stop saying the F word so often.
[113:04.34]My, I learned it from you.
[113:11.66]Okay, this is fun, I guess.
[113:35.11]Get out of my way!
[113:57.07]Go!
[114:01.67]Wink now.
[114:02.33]No, no, no!
[114:15.43]no no no this level sucks I don't want to do this level again I'm gonna try to get through no no wings not now no no no no no four wings you'll get it just no no
[114:46.48]I can't fucking see anything!
[115:02.30]Give me perfects!
[115:12.09]How the fuck do I not have perfects?
[115:20.24]Right at the fucking end.
[115:21.02]Give me a break.
[115:33.12]Wait.
[115:52.35]Is this even more of this shit?
[116:01.48]I'm surprised I did that.
[116:08.36]Six winks!
[116:09.86]What?
[116:13.25]Oh!
[116:23.29]Jesus Christ!
[116:24.73]No!
[116:42.16]That's a triple purple.
[116:43.22]The purple.
[116:44.20]What?
[116:44.82]Purple?
[116:46.74]Why can't I say this?
[116:47.59]Purple.
[116:48.81]Perfect.
[116:53.99]What happened?
[116:54.59]What?
[116:54.83]I thought, what, what do you mean I ran the wrong way?
[117:04.57]What the hell?
[117:06.45]What the fuck was that?
[117:07.37]Alright, Jesus.
[117:20.64]What the fuck was that?
[117:21.54]What do you mean I ran the wrong way?
[117:27.60]Oh, come on.
[117:28.18]I don't have to do this whole thing again, do I?
[117:31.12]Oh, give me a break.
[117:34.82]What the fuck?
[117:35.82]That was playing pretty well, too.
[117:37.76]How did I run the wrong way?
[117:39.80]Did you miss the wink?
[117:58.86]You ran into the wall instead of the door.
[118:00.66]No, fuck that.
[118:02.14]Come on.
[118:02.68]Give me a break.
[118:12.76]Wings are worthless now.
[118:15.50]That was hard too.
[118:35.03]Not a bad start.
[118:36.43]Except this stupid motherfucker in the back with the dumb bow and arrow.
[118:41.14]I hate arrows.
[118:44.12]It's so hard to see anything in this fucking game.
[118:46.08]Let alone the guy shooting the arrows.
[118:54.04]Missed another wink?
[118:54.74]No, I didn't.
[118:55.16]I did two extras.
[118:57.50]I did two extra winks, so I'm covered for those two that I missed.
[119:14.16]God damn it, I don't want to do this again.
[119:15.74]This mission is so dumb.
[119:17.20]This doesn't even happen in the movie.
[119:20.10]There's a cut.
[119:21.76]It cuts to them being outside.
[119:42.35]Get out of my fucking way.
[119:44.19]Come on, Ghibli.
[119:51.60]I'm not even fucking... Why wouldn't you put the camera, like, even 30 degrees higher than this?
[120:02.05]All I see is green smoke.
[120:26.27]Does anyone else taste iron?
[120:27.99]That's blood.
[120:28.39]You're tasting blood.
[120:30.79]I don't know why you're tasting blood, but I would maybe figure it out.
[120:38.81]Maybe you bit your tongue or something?
[120:40.29]Just be careful.
[120:45.64]Alright, this time I'm not gonna fuck it up.
[120:51.24]Let's go.
[121:04.23]I beat this game again and again when I was eight.
[121:05.97]No, you didn't.
[121:12.66]What the fuck is going on?
[121:15.66]Why?
[121:17.66]Come on.
[121:18.74]Fuck this level.
[121:20.62]Too slow.
[121:21.46]I'm walking down.
[121:22.82]That's not the wrong way.
[121:24.70]I'm literally walking down.
[121:43.63]What the fuck?
[121:45.49]What did I do wrong?
[121:46.67]I didn't do- I just was walking.
[121:57.71]That was stupid.
[122:10.36]These legs are too short.
[122:12.32]That's probably, like, whatever.
[122:13.83]Did I fuck it up again?
[122:40.61]I mean, he's perfect.
[122:52.45]Okay, can we please keep going?
[123:02.64]It's happening again.
[123:03.66]Oh no.
[123:04.36]Oh god, it's happening again.
[123:08.51]What, Jeremy runs into terrible game design choices?
[123:13.02]The stream?
[123:13.48]Is that what you're describing?
[123:31.67]Blame the player, not... No, no, don't blame game!
[123:34.11]Only blame game!
[123:36.23]It's never my fault.
[123:37.31]Only blame video game.
[124:14.09]Call Peter Jackson right now.
[124:16.34]I don't know what Peter Jackson's fucking telephone number is and he had nothing to do with this game.
[124:52.86]We're good!
[124:53.16]We're good!
[124:53.50]We're good!
[124:53.78]We're good!
[124:54.02]We're good!
[124:54.32]We're good!
[124:56.88]Dead are still here!
[124:59.91]Nice frame.
[125:00.59]They're actually not even as bad as you're saying.
[125:03.07]They're only, like, 10 feet.
[125:03.97]That's a start.
[125:10.25]I'll take this stuff now!
[125:12.97]We must get out!
[125:18.35]I'm just gonna spam square because of what... I'm just gonna get perfects by doing this because there's so many people here.
[125:36.46]And... I can't even.
[125:42.60]I guess I hit somebody with an axe.
[126:02.84]Zip.
[126:03.40]I guess.
[126:33.82]Jesus Christ.
[126:38.59]And three come out.
[126:39.37]And then I... Okay, where's the right... Where did I go?
[126:41.33]Where's the right way?
[126:44.95]Look at the... Doesn't this break away?
[126:46.21]This looks like it breaks away, but it's not this way.
[126:49.52]It's down here?
[126:50.20]I gotta get this right from when I need to leave.
[126:58.28]Down here.
[127:01.09]Oh, left?
[127:03.43]Like the way that I came in?
[127:06.48]Like over here.
[127:12.56]Your other left.
[127:13.38]That is left.
[127:17.24]So this way.
[127:32.53]Alright, let's go.
[127:33.19]I don't want to be... More... What's going on?
[127:38.48]What's happening?
[127:40.06]What is going on?
[127:41.54]What?
[127:48.29]What the fuck?
[127:51.33]The art that took too long?
[127:56.91]That was the last ar- Why are they even spawning?
[127:59.69]What the f- Give me a break.
[128:02.37]Oh, I'm actually mad about this.
[128:03.89]What the fuck, man.
[128:09.94]They're spawning the archer over on the right where the camera don't even fucking look.
[128:24.82]What am I going to complain about a 20-year-old game?
[128:29.40]Who cares?
[128:29.98]Oh, sorry.
[128:36.04]17-year-old game.
[128:42.63]I have to pee, too.
[128:45.03]Can I skip this mission?
[129:06.46]Give me some perfect I like that better when Christopher Lee was talking that was interesting.
[129:19.41]I Can't even get that help
[129:31.18]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[129:44.22]You always gotta do something with this bullshit.
[129:47.80]Alright, I'm gonna beat this one.
[129:49.73]I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[129:53.40]Is it too early to be mauling?
[129:55.67]I hate timed missions.
[129:56.81]No matter what it is.
[129:57.41]I hate scrolling Mario levels for the same damn reason.
[130:01.23]Don't put pressure on me.
[130:02.37]Fuck off.
[130:03.71]I want to play.
[130:04.63]Game.
[130:32.77]I'm gonna die.
[130:33.31]I'm gonna die in here.
[130:34.23]If I die again, I have to go pee.
[131:00.82]pee your pants.
[131:02.08]No, no, no.
[131:02.94]Don't tell me to do that.
[131:03.54]That's not a good idea.
[131:24.99]What the fuck am I walking into right now?
[131:29.50]There's nothing in that water, man.
[131:31.64]There's nothing in that water.
[131:33.02]Alright, this is it.
[131:35.42]Let's go.
[131:37.56]I'm trying as hard as I can.
[131:38.54]Am I going to save work?
[131:44.15]We must get out!
[132:39.34]Let's go!
[132:41.14]Is there still somebody over here?
[132:43.24]Come on, man.
[132:44.03]Let's go.
[132:45.67]Out!
[132:56.37]Legolas, get the fuck out of the way.
[133:05.13]Kill him, kill him, kill him, please, for the love of God.
[133:22.29]Every time.
[133:22.93]It's right at the end.
[133:24.23]Oh, slow down.
[133:25.33]I'm okay.
[133:26.29]I don't have to get mad about anything.
[133:30.27]I saw, have we failed?
[133:31.83]I saw the word failed.
[133:32.77]And I got very upset.
[133:36.01]I got annoyed for a second.
[133:47.88]10 perfect.
[133:48.80]Ooh, 14.
[133:50.71]I gotta pee.
[133:51.63]You've hated every mission so far.
[133:55.84]That's not true.
[133:57.14]I like the second one.
[134:07.62]That's the combo for all.
[134:10.34]Hmm, what should I do?
[134:16.02]Jeremy, please stop streaming.
[134:17.17]My friend won't play a game with me because he's watching you stream.
[134:24.09]Go play with your friend.
[134:28.01]What's his name?
[134:29.18]What's their name?
[134:33.48]Look, just go play whatever you're going to play.
[134:36.53]Go play with them.
[134:39.18]Don't worry, you're not going to miss much.
[134:40.40]All you're going to miss is me, over the next three, four hours, progressively get more annoyed at this PlayStation 2 game.
[134:49.20]To a point where I hit a wall, and I say, I'm sorry guys, I'm not going to be able to do this tonight, because I don't like this game.
[134:56.78]And it's making me very angry.
[134:59.06]And then we're going to sit there for an hour on the same mission, I'll finally beat it, and I'll be like, wow, what a good experience.
[135:02.84]You're not going to miss very much.
[135:11.78]I'm going to get it all.
[135:13.42]You spoiled the whole stream.
[135:17.64]No, that's not going to happen.
[135:23.20]Parry, then instantly kill a man-sized enemy.
[135:25.96]Do it for everybody.
[135:27.58]Can I do healing again?
[135:28.90]No.
[135:28.98]I'm going to save the points.
[135:33.48]I'm not going to spend them.
[135:34.68]Alright, it's time to pee.
[135:40.12]Let's go pee.
[135:42.13]Well, pee if you have to, but... We're back.
[135:53.26]I'll be right back.
[136:02.50]Wait, what's going on?
[136:03.18]Why is it doing this?
[136:10.02]Southern Gate.
[136:12.73]No concept art or interview?
[136:14.74]Come on.
[140:02.35]Hey, I saw a comment here I want to comment on.
[140:06.97]It says, I wonder what the average day for a Jerma viewer is.
[140:12.58]I think I could have a pretty accurate statement of what that is.
[140:17.38]You get up in the morning at 7.30 a.m.
[140:20.02]sharp.
[140:22.73]Answer your 20 emails on the incredible time you're doing on the stock market.
[140:27.42]You're up at least to $300,000, I think, total.
[140:29.08]You're doing really good trades.
[140:31.34]You do technical analysis.
[140:32.58]Pretty good.
[140:34.06]You're getting your BMW on the way to work.
[140:37.70]You're a neurosurgeon.
[140:40.12]Do your first neurosurgery of the day.
[140:44.30]Check on the stream.
[140:44.94]See what we're doing.
[140:50.32]See that I'm playing Lord of the Rings.
[140:51.26]You're like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[140:55.15]Have lunch?
[140:58.01]I'm only 23, dude.
[140:58.69]That's real young to be doing the things you're doing.
[141:03.86]Damn.
[141:04.52]Good work.
[141:11.80]That's me!
[141:12.56]That's me!
[141:17.32]Real wink?
[141:18.38]Hold on a sec.
[141:19.94]I have somehow tangled my headset.
[141:22.19]I don't even know how I did this.
[141:25.60]Like, how did I do this?
[141:28.80]I'm going to hold this up because this is just, this is an oddity.
[141:33.72]How did this happen?
[141:35.88]What did I do to have this happen?
[141:40.73]Look, it has its own gravity.
[141:47.27]It has its own gravitational pull.
[141:49.44]How does this make any fucking sense?
[141:52.30]What is going on right here?
[142:03.44]It's standing up.
[142:08.63]This wasn't like this when I left the room.
[142:17.59]Mega milk shirt.
[142:20.64]No.
[142:21.64]No, I'm sorry.
[142:23.12]I'm sorry.

[144:15.68]Oh, that hurts.
[144:35.35]Back up.
[144:35.95]Ugh, I can't do a big swing.
[144:42.20]This should kill it.
[144:43.62]No!
[144:52.94]Use pyromancy?
[144:56.88]Yeah, what the hell was I thinking?
[144:58.28]I'm dead.
[145:03.32]Stand back and cast lightning bolts at the motherfucker.
[145:15.93]This is a grim scene.
[145:18.83]I remember this.
[145:19.99]Yeah.
[145:20.46]I remember hearing this is a grim scene more than a dozen times.
[145:25.18]Hmm.
[145:31.70]He goes, this is a grim scene.
[145:33.16]Every time.
[145:33.58]Yeah, I actually think this might be a hard one.
[145:42.06]20 hour stream?
[145:42.82]No, it won't be that long.
[145:50.68]Do I have the instant kill?
[145:54.20]You don't, do I?
[145:56.40]Does he have it?
[145:58.02]I don't think he has it.
[146:02.30]Alright, let's try to get this happening here.
[146:09.96]Alright, you bait him over there, and then I'll...
[146:25.11]How am I supposed to get him?
[146:25.83]How am I supposed to attack him?
[146:27.33]He does that every time.
[146:31.16]It's an instant counter.
[146:33.04]Can I environment kill him or something?
[146:39.50]Holy shit, this is fucking horrible.
[146:45.78]I'm dead.
[146:53.82]One tap, run?
[146:54.88]But when I get close enough, it's almost like you kind of can't avoid it.
[146:57.62]One tap, run.
[146:58.38]One tap, run.
[146:59.12]One tap, run.
[147:01.84]Oh, no.

[147:23.50]Yeah, yep, alright, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[147:28.39]So go trigger the cutscene.
[147:30.91]Okay.
[147:38.35]I'm so gonna throw.
[147:46.74]Okay.
[147:49.44]That's who I wanted to throw my spear at, is the guy across the game.
[147:55.84]Yeah, that's who I wanted to throw the fucking spear at.
[147:58.44]Like, the sound guy.
[147:59.64]Alright, give me... He knows what I'm trying to do.
[148:16.47]Here we go.
[148:22.16]You don't!
[148:26.42]I just got fucked up.
[148:29.28]Why won't he come over here?
[148:30.58]Come over here.
[148:35.87]God damn it.
[148:42.49]You know what I could probably just do down here?
[148:43.83]I could probably just get a shitload of perfects.
[148:52.46]Why even fight the guy?
[148:53.94]He's blind.
[148:59.06]Okay, here we go.
[149:00.10]I haven't even fought the troll yet.
[149:11.17]Oh god.
[149:12.47]Oh god.
[149:13.21]Oh god.
[149:13.81]Oh god.
[149:14.19]Too many.
[149:17.58]I can't even swing the axe.
[149:20.26]I can't swing the axe.
[149:21.00]I can't do it.
[149:22.24]Ow.
[149:22.32]Ow.
[149:22.98]Ow.
[149:45.06]Is the troll still at the door?
[149:47.16]He is, isn't he?
[149:49.06]He's still going to be there when I do this, right?
[149:54.79]Fuck, too many people.
[149:58.87]Too many people over here.
[149:59.97]Alright, launch the other one.
[150:01.63]Let's go.
[150:05.04]Did he get up there?
[150:23.16]I did two damage to him.
[150:24.48]No, I did more than that.
[150:32.81]This is going to take a while.
[150:33.89]This is a grim scene.
[150:44.06]We shall head northward and then through Gondor's southern gate.
[150:47.84]Here to join the great battle of our time.
[150:49.30]I remember this level.
[150:50.06]I played it over and over.
[150:53.54]We'll be alright.
[150:54.69]I'll get it right now.
[150:55.75]This is a grim scene.
[150:57.85]I can smell orc even from this distance.
[151:01.11]Stay alert.
[151:06.63]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[151:10.88]We must get past him.
[151:27.08]Yes, I know this catapult!
[151:31.16]I'm also surrounded by people auto-attacking me at all times.
[151:47.21]Launch it!
[151:47.55]Let's go!
[151:55.43]How many?
[151:55.73]How many?
[151:56.22]Four?
[152:04.74]Alright, I'll get it in 1, 2, 3, 4.
[152:05.82]Alright, I did it.
[152:18.91]Please get out of my way.
[152:23.81]Are they with me?
[152:24.47]Are they running with me now?
[152:25.41]Ah!
[152:32.55]Do it!
[152:33.69]Do it!
[152:34.87]R1!
[152:35.39]What?
[152:44.28]Okay, now I need to go forward to the gate?
[152:59.97]I can't even fucking walk.
[153:02.48]Just please.
[153:07.36]Is there one more catapult somewhere?
[153:15.18]No, I think I just have to... Is it the troll?
[153:20.62]Do I have to kill the troll?
[153:21.44]I have to kill the troll, don't I?
[153:23.06]I gotta kill this troll, don't I?
[153:26.22]Ayayay.
[153:28.26]Oh boy.
[153:28.64]Alright.
[153:28.98]Okay.
[153:29.36]Alright.
[153:29.80]Let me... I got help.
[153:35.27]Relax.
[153:42.55]Okay.
[153:43.29]Anybody?
[153:45.91]Dude, how the fuck am I going to throw a spear at this guy in the middle of all this bullshit?
[153:51.15]How the hell is that going to happen?
[153:55.90]Like, what?
[153:56.40]I'm the only guy on the field right now.
[154:00.28]How am I going to throw a spear at the troll?
[154:08.75]Just kill them all.
[154:10.55]I think they eventually... Here we go.
[154:12.55]Opportunity.
[154:29.86]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[154:37.57]What else?
[154:38.01]Now what else?
[154:39.03]Do I have to go kill that motherfucker right now just on my own?
[154:52.82]I can't kill this troll by myself.
[154:54.30]Is there any more catapults?
[155:00.69]Is there one more over here?
[155:01.51]There might be.
[155:04.83]It's not timed or anything.
[155:05.78]No, there's nothing over here.
[155:14.74]Sorry.
[155:15.18]That was like the script supervisor.
[155:18.69]Sorry.
[155:23.25]I just have to get in there, I think.
[155:24.41]And fight the trolls?
[155:30.60]How the fuck am I gonna do this?
[155:36.12]I can't even... Get out of the... Please, get out of the way so I can throw a spear.
[155:53.72]The right side didn't... I'm just over here.
[155:59.20]Wait, actually, I can run through this?
[156:02.52]Oh.
[156:04.88]Look at how small that is.
[156:06.26]How the fuck am I supposed to... No.
[156:09.73]I didn't know.
[156:11.71]At least we didn't have to restart it.
[156:26.90]Oh my god, there's a big one up here.
[156:29.33]How do I get rid of this guy?
[156:31.43]What?
[156:33.45]Didn't I shoot a catapult at this guy?
[156:35.61]Dude, he just hit me over the edge.
[156:39.57]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[156:41.37]What?
[156:41.55]Dude.
[156:41.67]Okay.
[156:41.97]I need health.
[157:02.79]Somebody drop health, please.
[157:07.11]This is never going to stop coming.
[157:13.36]Okay.
[157:13.90]I just burnt the orc?
[157:21.50]Full health right there.
[157:22.99]I'm in perfect mode.
[157:23.63]I'm in perfect mode.
[157:24.49]Just hit him.
[157:33.16]Ow, that hurts.
[157:34.64]Oh my god, I just got double tapped.
[157:37.58]Fuck.
[157:38.80]Watch out, watch out, watch out, please.
[157:43.07]Can I help?
[157:54.31]I can't... If I go in there and hit him, he swings and fucking hits.
[157:56.74]See?
[157:57.22]Those two idiots did the same thing.
[157:59.10]Even the AI cannot avoid that hit.
[158:01.00]I have to...
[158:08.92]Throwing axes.
[158:09.88]This video game does this thing where it auto-locks onto somebody and I can't change it.
[158:13.93]I would love to throw an axe at him, but it's going to pick one of the random actors in front of me.
[158:20.51]I'm going to run.
[158:21.56]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[158:29.10]This guy's almost dead.
[158:29.72]Alright, that one's dead.
[158:30.92]Nope, not yet.
[158:38.98]It's not gonna happen.
[158:43.08]Get out of the way!
[158:44.48]Just kill him!
[158:45.21]Alright, go down!
[158:46.29]I'm going down.
[158:46.69]I'm going back down.
[158:55.27]This is just to get in the front door.
[158:56.90]What the hell happens when you get through the house?
[159:09.20]Okay.
[159:09.42]I'm just going to go back.
[159:11.23]No, I'm going to go back down.
[159:12.85]Can I even reliably get by him?
[159:13.99]Holy shit, he just got hit once.
[159:16.23]Okay, fuck you.
[159:20.05]I win.
[159:23.11]Alright, now we go.
[159:31.21]We're good.
[159:31.53]We're good.
[159:31.79]We're good.
[159:32.15]We're good.
[159:32.43]See?
[159:46.37]OK.
[159:46.47]OK.
[160:12.79]Okay, he explodes.
[160:14.87]I didn't know he was gonna explode.
[160:16.47]That was bullshit.
[160:23.07]You didn't give me a second, man.
[160:24.20]I was in a cutscene.
[160:24.96]That's not fair.
[160:26.42]Alright, you guys handle this.
[160:28.18]While I do this.
[160:28.82]They're not gonna do that.
[160:44.69]It's so unfair, man.
[160:46.49]Am I still fighting up here?
[160:50.75]I'm getting hit up here.
[160:51.79]I can't... I'm getting hit.
[160:54.95]Do you see how much... Good thing I was spamming square, because I would be dead.
[161:08.88]Back down.
[161:11.36]Wait, no.
[161:11.70]Dump the acid on him.
[161:18.92]Okay, I parked him.
[161:19.46]Let's go.
[161:27.89]Good.
[161:28.15]Let's go.
[161:31.93]Dude, what the fuck?
[161:32.49]That's gravy.
[161:37.30]Get this guy out of here.
[161:39.24]Alright, let's go.
[161:41.48]Back down through the front door.
[161:51.21]That's the best song ever.
[161:59.70]There's no health down here?
[162:02.02]How could there not be health in here?
[162:08.96]Is it the end of the level?
[162:10.58]Yep.
[162:10.78]That was tricky.
[162:16.97]That was tricky.
[162:17.49]That's a good grind level.
[162:18.49]Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.
[162:22.84]We had big bits.
[162:23.48]We had 10,000 bits from Freakout.
[162:26.02]Wait, didn't I ban you?
[162:26.74]I think I banned you from giving bits ever again or something, didn't I?
[162:36.30]Yeah, this is a guy.
[162:37.32]Yeah, this is a ban.
[162:38.64]I banned myself from reading this person's bits ever again.
[162:41.28]Ban him again.
[162:48.53]Yeah, it's, yeah.
[162:54.89]What the fuck, what?!
[162:58.57]No, this is the porn guy.
[162:59.89]This is the porn codes porno, porno guy.
[163:02.83]Yeah, I, I, I, no, I, they, they struck out.
[163:13.88]Ooh, this is good.
[163:22.23]Use unpowerful foes to smash a shield, knock him to the ground, and strike.
[163:25.15]Yep.
[163:27.83]Give him a chance.
[163:29.45]Give him a chance.
[163:30.38]Give him a chance.
[163:30.90]Give him a chance.
[163:31.40]Give him a chance.
[163:32.00]Give him a chance.
[163:34.00]Oh, you had three chances.
[163:35.02]That's how baseball works.
[163:36.60]You swing and miss three times, you're out.
[163:41.28]You already had your at-bat.
[163:46.39]What, you want me to give this guy a whole inning worth of outs?
[163:57.96]A whole season.
[164:01.24]I'll give him a chance.
[164:04.08]I'll give him one more chance.
[164:04.88]This is it.
[164:05.24]Okay, ready?
[164:06.24]This is freak out.
[164:06.96]Thanks for the hundred bucks.
[164:08.06]It's a lot of money.
[164:08.94]You've given a shitload of money.
[164:10.00]But you've also been banned from me reading them.
[164:12.44]But I'm doing it anyways.
[164:13.86]So, we'll get a try.
[164:16.66]So, stop me.
[164:17.50]I'm going to say this very slowly.
[164:19.12]Stop me if there's something wrong with this message.
[164:21.71]Stop?
[164:50.89]You going?
[164:52.21]Okay.
[164:53.65]Uh, a man is lost, but the same man can be lost in sauce.
[164:58.43]At first I didn't get it, but once I saw a bee drown in honey.
[165:06.50]I don't know, I don't... Is that another route for this guy?
[165:21.56]Porn.
[165:26.13]Encrypted porn.
[165:27.59]Encrypted.
[165:29.79]I feel like I should buy something.
[165:31.23]No, I'm going to save it for Samwise.
[165:32.57]I'm not going to play... Let's go.
[165:37.65]Here it is.
[165:37.95]I want everybody to have this.
[165:42.83]Strength of Iron.
[165:43.39]I want everyone to have this, too.
[165:48.23]Dark Deliverance.
[165:49.85]I got a new combo, though.
[165:50.57]What is it?
[165:52.95]It's... What is it?
[165:55.71]Triangle?
[165:56.98]No, what is it?
[165:57.44]I just did it.
[165:58.36]Didn't I just get it?
[165:59.68]No, I didn't.
[166:03.56]Triangle, triangle, circle, triangle.
[166:04.82]Yeah.
[166:13.79]But thank you, FreakUp, for the 10,000 bits.
[166:17.07]100 fucking dollars.
[166:18.11]It's a shitload of money.
[166:19.09]It's a ton of money.
[166:19.71]It's too much money.
[166:22.87]But yes, unfortunately, I will be screening your calls for the remainder of time that you give any money if you ever do again.
[166:29.41]That's just the way it works.
[166:30.73]I'm going to screen your calls now.
[166:36.88]Ooh, alright, we're at the fields.
[166:39.86]We're almost at the end of the game.
[166:43.48]This shit hadn't been 11, 12, 13 hours.
[166:44.66]I'm going to beat this game soon.
[166:51.45]This game's shorter than the last one.
[166:53.73]That's interesting.
[166:54.61]Alright, let's do Minas Tirith, Top of the Wall.
[167:02.41]Oh, yeah.
[167:03.95]I'm so happy I get to be Gandalf.
[167:10.92]Who are the secret characters?
[167:13.96]You missed an interview?
[167:15.06]Oh, shit.
[167:15.90]I'll get it.
[167:16.28]We'll watch it.
[167:24.11]The last game included parts of Fellowship of the Ring.
[167:26.25]Oh, that's true.
[167:34.30]When Sauron learns that the Ring is in the hands of a hobbit, he will be drawn to it.
[167:39.46]Fate has given us four, and he knows not who bears the Ring.
[167:43.75]Your favorite level?
[167:44.77]This confusion is the bait I must place in my trap.
[167:48.61]Don't you understand?
[167:51.36]DMCA
[168:10.49]The elephant wave level is really, really grim.
[168:15.10]I mean, really grim.
[168:17.56]Like, you can smell the bad design.
[168:19.26]Oh.
[168:19.62]I missed a wink?
[168:20.06]Fucking thanks for reminding me.
[168:36.35]My word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Alathorn, and I tell you now, I will not bow to this ranger from the north.
[168:48.43]Is there any hope, Gandalf?
[168:50.45]No, absolutely none.
[168:53.23]Everyone's going to die.
[168:55.99]Just a fool's hope.
[168:58.99]It will be before these walls that the doom of our time shall be decided.
[169:14.71]What an outfit.
[169:20.13]I want to wear that outfit.
[169:21.41]I want to wear this.
[169:23.05]Like the big robe.
[169:24.79]And like the cool like pants.
[169:29.09]Why can't I be like a cool magical wizard or something?
[169:36.67]Oh no, it's... No, what?
[169:40.68]Hold on, it's a ladder level?
[169:42.58]No, it can't be.
[169:43.89]It can't be.
[169:44.31]They wouldn't bring this back.
[169:45.21]How do I... How do I knock the ladders down?
[169:49.31]No, it can't be.
[169:55.80]How do you kick a la- how do you kick him down?
[169:58.14]Circle?
[169:59.10]Oh my god.
[170:00.04]Okay.
[170:00.86]Uh, this is- okay.
[170:03.54]There's a ladder level and there's so much- this, like, verticality?
[170:07.38]Launch the catapult!
[170:10.30]Gandalf, launch the catapult!
[170:26.81]No, not a ladder level.
[170:30.73]Anything but a ladder level.
[170:34.63]Well, it looks like I'm doing okay.
[170:45.57]It's not a total lost cause yet.
[170:48.25]Maybe this one's more forgiving.
[171:04.36]It's not?
[171:05.34]That's great.
[171:06.26]It's really good to hear.
[171:07.88]This design level is kind of odd.
[171:11.78]This is all the way to the right?
[171:14.28]Okay, this is all the way to the right.
[171:20.39]Is there any health or anything over here that I can see or need?
[171:25.17]What does the orc clock in the top right mean?
[171:27.89]When it gets full, that means it's over?
[171:38.42]What is this?
[171:38.76]Where am I going?
[171:43.21]Why can't I go down here?
[171:45.81]Seems like a place I don't want to be.
[171:49.83]Or is it?
[172:10.80]Whoa!
[172:16.52]Somebody drop health.
[172:17.91]Somebody drop health.
[172:18.65]Thank you.
[172:25.93]Okay, this is not as bad as the last one was.
[172:33.56]The last one was unbelievably awful.
[172:46.45]Let's go.
[172:56.50]I... Um... Siege towers.
[172:58.98]Top of the capitals.
[173:00.06]Yep.
[173:00.40]Up here.
[173:01.36]Watch out!
[173:01.92]You guys know what to do?
[173:06.56]Fire!
[173:09.84]Got it?
[173:11.94]Good, right?
[173:13.22]Direct hit.
[173:13.66]Got it.
[173:13.98]Can I do it again?
[173:14.50]Do I have to do this again?
[173:16.08]It's still here.
[173:18.10]Fire.
[173:20.62]Okay.
[173:21.02]I got to go down here.
[173:24.05]There's a dragon, too.
[173:24.79]Alright.
[173:25.65]Hurry up.
[173:36.31]You're perfect.
[173:36.81]Come on.
[173:37.09]Go, go, go.
[173:45.64]There it is.
[173:45.98]Perfect.
[173:46.30]Let's go.
[173:54.21]Need help?
[173:56.37]Oh, shit.
[173:57.03]Here comes another one.
[173:58.99]Excuse me.
[174:04.71]Is there another catapult, or is it just the one catapult?
[174:08.84]Catapult up here.
[174:10.08]I hope to God there is.
[174:15.68]Hurry, hurry, catapult.
[174:17.82]Oh, fuck.
[174:33.57]They've made it.
[174:33.99]They've made it.
[174:34.77]They've made it.
[174:35.11]It's over.
[174:48.39]What happens if it breaches?
[174:53.85]I mean, are they just going to pour in?
[174:56.89]Oh, I'll be fine.
[175:01.48]No, kill it.
[175:03.96]Okay, that's good, I think.
[175:05.28]Okay.
[175:14.76]I was concerned pretty much for no reason.
[175:16.17]That's not even a big deal.
[175:20.11]See ya.
[175:26.15]Come on.
[175:26.65]Where are they all?
[175:28.91]Why is it... They're all over here.
[175:34.56]Holy fuck, there's so many.
[175:39.42]Come on.
[175:39.74]Okay, okay, okay.
[175:48.35]Okay, I'm gonna lose.
[175:55.68]How many... There's not even that many ladders up.
[176:03.39]Like, dude, I'm fucking going!
[176:04.87]There's nobody even up here!
[176:16.24]Alright, I have to shoot the catapult.
[176:22.32]No, I don't.
[176:22.64]Fuck it.
[176:22.90]Let's go.
[176:23.18]Alright.
[176:43.27]Alright, seriously.
[176:45.45]When is this gonna be over?
[176:56.22]Alright.
[177:02.48]Let me get this first try.
[177:03.32]I don't wanna do this again.
[177:17.36]There's nobody even over here.
[177:28.95]Okay, there are people over here.
[177:30.40]Quite a few, actually.
[177:36.22]There's quite a few people over here.
[177:46.48]Alright, let's go.
[178:08.37]No, fuck you.
[178:10.05]These guys just spawned out of nowhere.
[178:14.45]They weren't even here.
[178:26.40]Where?
[178:27.60]No!
[178:30.01]Oh, where is this?
[178:30.85]No, hurry, right here, here, here.
[178:43.46]Hmm...
[178:49.49]Get this shit out of here.
[178:51.27]Alright.
[178:52.61]Now I'm going to go shoot the- with the catapult.
[178:55.85]Shoot the tower.
[178:56.43]That's what I'm going to do.
[178:57.01]I'm going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going.
[179:00.63]Hurry up.
[179:00.89]Hurry up.
[179:01.21]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[179:03.66]Move, move, move, move, move.
[179:09.86]Move.
[179:10.06]Get out of my way.
[179:16.08]What is this fucking tower I'm in?
[179:17.69]What is this?
[179:19.89]This is not the catapult?
[179:20.95]What the fuck is this?
[179:22.03]Why is this even here?
[179:23.55]What's this here for?
[179:25.95]What a waste of time to be able to even go up on this tower.
[179:28.88]Why is this here?
[179:30.34]What?
[179:35.30]I gotta... I can't do it.
[179:36.44]I gotta fucking clear this out.
[179:52.88]God, let's just make a vehicle for a random fucking tower.
[179:56.42]That means nothing And by the way, the cameras are going to change angles 15 times What the fuck
[180:28.55]Ladder levels not another ladder level And we let's go alright.
[180:34.20]I'm ready Destroy the siege tower.
[180:37.02]I try to just do it, but we have cinematic towers to climb And another timed ass mission in this timed ass game You cannot stop us!
[180:55.11]God damn it.
[180:56.06]I can't fucking believe I have to do this again.
[180:58.00]We already did this in the last game.
[181:01.14]This doesn't even happen in Return of the King.
[181:02.70]They just wanted to redo it.
[181:03.96]Because it was easy to put it as its own level.
[181:29.07]Lord of the Ladders.
[181:32.39]God damn it, man.
[181:43.80]Where the fuck even is anybody?
[181:47.22]You cannot stop
[181:55.83]Get your shit out of here Alright, I'm gonna call that there's something wrong with your fucking gauge There's nobody here, why would that be at like 50% filled there's only one ladder
[182:28.17]Go all the way over here.
[182:29.93]I gotta remember where this catapult is.
[182:35.53]Nothing over here, right?
[182:36.47]No.
[182:48.18]Dude, these camera changes make me want to throw up into my hands and use it to wash my face.
[182:53.48]This is seriously the most disorienting fucking thing ever.
[183:12.05]This is on the same plane!
[183:14.47]We've changed directions like four times!
[183:28.49]You have a two-wink death?
[183:29.53]That's alright.
[183:30.61]I'll settle it up later.
[183:39.67]Two links in the sink.
[183:45.45]Goddamn, I don't want to do another ladder push level.
[183:48.63]Nobody wants to do a ladder push level.
[183:53.16]Here we go.
[183:53.74]And there's already a bunch of people up here and I have to shoot it twice.
[184:01.22]Fuck.
[184:03.40]Oh man, oh man.
[184:06.50]Here we go.
[184:07.46]Here we go again.
[184:13.60]We're going to go up here and get this over with.
[184:15.94]You can't... Why can't you just fire without me?
[184:25.51]I need to tell you when to fire.
[184:26.73]Just fire.
[184:28.03]You're in the right spot.
[184:28.87]Why do you need someone to tell you to do it?
[184:30.31]Just do it.
[184:46.01]I gotta clean up some of this shit.
[185:06.80]Fucking flashbacks.
[185:09.80]I'm already overwhelmed.
[185:11.60]I have to fire them.
[185:17.37]I'm gonna lose.
[185:27.14]Hey, idiots!
[185:28.28]What are you... What are you aiming at?
[185:33.82]Why is this not turning in the other direction?
[185:35.71]What?
[185:36.09]Why is this not firing in the other direction?
[185:41.88]Why would they not be firing into the right side now?
[185:44.72]I'm very confused.
[185:46.78]They only want to shoot at the one coming in on the left side.
[185:50.78]What the fuck is that?
[185:54.94]They won't rotate it.
[186:01.57]What?
[186:03.13]To shoot the tower yourself.
[186:04.73]Well, what in the name of God is the reason to use the catapult in the first place?
[186:11.13]oh my god there's no nothing there's no reason
[186:38.02]okay here we go I'm gonna I'm just gonna ignore it
[186:59.90]Somebody said that 80%... Well, you know, you could say that.
[187:03.80]That's accurate.
[187:04.56]I don't think it's not 80.
[187:06.42]A significant portion of my 2020 streams have been running around pushing ladders down.
[187:11.34]That's true.
[187:12.84]How many hours have I streamed in 2020?
[187:14.18]Anybody know?
[187:15.48]Do we have that data?
[187:16.44]Because at least six of those hours or so have been pushing ladders down in a Lord of the Rings game.
[187:22.69]I mean, it's got to be like probably 5%, 6%.
[187:42.12]What the fuck hit me?
[187:42.86]You cannot stop us!
[187:44.26]Alright, let's get that to 12%.
[187:47.72]Strike down their ladders!
[187:53.08]They shall overrun us!
[187:58.31]Alright, alright.
[187:58.81]I'm gonna stop reading chat and play the game.
[188:05.05]You know what?
[188:05.43]Go down here.
[188:09.86]It's probably easier for me to hit these.
[188:12.62]Just go all the way around.
[188:14.14]Right?
[188:24.87]That's the Scrat.
[188:25.49]Anytime there's any more than one in the middle.
[188:38.62]Where's this?
[188:42.14]Where's this thing?
[188:42.92]It's a fucking tiny ass ladder.
[189:02.76]Guy!
[189:11.43]We already did this.
[189:16.55]I don't want to do it again.
[189:17.73]I don't want to do this again.
[189:24.25]I'm not even having flashbacks.
[189:25.91]I'm redoing.
[189:27.23]I'm reimagining the same thing I did.
[189:30.04]This is not a flashback.
[189:49.12]Look at my fucking health, dude.
[189:55.08]It's so bad.
[189:58.94]Move, please.
[190:04.06]There's another catapult for the other side.
[190:05.78]Why doesn't it show up on the minimap?
[190:07.74]Why is this the only one that shows up on the minimap?
[190:19.64]So, I'm gonna... I need health, too.
[190:25.58]I might have to restart this one.
[190:31.15]Because this thing's gonna get... I need to get over here.
[190:34.93]Get out of my fucking way.
[190:36.03]I'm a pain in the ass.
[190:39.07]Our catapults are vital.
[190:41.54]With them, we shall destroy those towers.
[190:48.70]Is it a dragon on our team?
[190:50.51]He's gonna make it, isn't he?
[190:53.37]Oh boy, what a grim scene this one is.
[191:01.23]Now please give me health.
[191:02.07]Can I drain somebody?
[191:03.93]Let me just, like, life drain one of these fucking guys.
[191:08.07]Oh my god, there's too many.
[191:13.60]So there is a catapult on the lower right corner here.
[191:18.04]Is that what you're saying?
[191:20.38]Or should I just go shoot it with my shooting?
[191:22.98]Should I shoot it?
[191:25.98]I'm just going to shoot it with my own arm.
[191:27.66]I'm going to shoot it with my own arm.
[191:57.88]It actually worked.
[191:59.70]I can do that, but I'm going to lose anyways because I don't have a second player who's doing the other shit while I do that.
[192:14.04]Look at all these guys in here, get up!
[192:17.56]Come on!
[192:19.88]Die!
[192:22.01]Die, please!
[192:25.05]Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[192:32.05]Oh my God, give me a break!
[192:34.61]Move, move, move!
[192:45.66]Knock it down, knock it down.
[192:46.32]Alright, I gotta, yeah, I gotta shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[192:55.13]Come on, come on, come on, come on, go, go, go, go!
[193:00.29]Where is it?
[193:04.44]It's here already, it's here.
[193:07.64]Is it here?
[193:07.92]Help those men!
[193:26.08]Alright, keep going.
[193:26.58]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[193:33.87]What?
[193:34.89]That was only... That was on the mini-map for like one second.
[193:37.63]That's got to be scripted, right?
[193:38.53]That has to be scripted, right?
[193:40.87]Stand fast!
[193:44.32]Don't those walls mess with our lives!
[193:53.49]Dude, please just get out of the fucking goddamn way.
[193:56.68]You're driving me nuts.
[193:58.60]You're driving me nuts with this bullshit.
[194:02.32]I can't... Just... God damn it!
[194:29.09]How many of you have to die before I get a fucking opportunity?
[194:33.79]Oh, good.
[194:34.05]Hit the wall.
[194:35.25]Excellent work, Gandalf.
[194:36.77]Your aim is impeccable.
[194:54.24]Actually mad.
[194:55.47]No, I'm... No, I'm not.
[195:02.13]What?
[195:07.49]Half mad?
[195:10.44]No, they can't.
[195:11.08]So what do we do?
[195:11.88]Go down?
[195:12.84]Where are we going?
[195:14.24]Where are we running to?
[195:18.70]I don't know.
[195:20.50]Gandalf doesn't have a fucking plan.
[195:22.96]I don't know!
[195:23.54]Just fucking run!
[195:26.82]Get in the bathtub!
[195:28.40]I heard that's the best place to go when there's a tornado!
[195:31.70]Maybe it'll work here!
[195:32.74]Are we gonna get out?
[195:38.95]Where am I?
[195:42.45]He doesn't know!
[195:43.69]Oh shit!
[195:45.41]Get out quick!
[195:49.91]Ow!
[195:51.17]Oh, my chest.
[196:02.07]Gandalf, what did you do?
[196:02.95]You just killed everybody.
[196:11.80]Oh, that sucked.
[196:13.26]Not as long as the last one, though.
[196:14.43]Thankfully.
[196:21.29]I hate those.
[196:22.51]Ladder levels are so the worst.
[196:25.12]I hate them.
[196:27.29]I don't want no more ladders.
[196:29.61]The only ladders I want to climb are... I said it wrong.
[196:34.45]The only ladders I want are the ones that I climb.
[196:41.46]That's a lot of experience.
[196:49.61]Hmm.
[196:56.68]Did I buy everything for everybody?
[196:58.00]Let's see.
[196:59.40]Lightning bolt.
[197:00.16]Increase damage on the projectile.
[197:01.97]I want that.
[197:05.29]I use it a lot.
[197:07.61]What's this link?
[197:08.09]What are you guys spamming here?
[197:10.05]What is this?
[197:22.20]Alright, I like it.
[197:22.88]Let's put it on.
[197:40.60]Uh, let's get what I want first.
[197:43.30]Which is, I want the combo.
[197:44.22]Effective for rapidly dispatching shielded enemies.
[197:46.18]Yeah.
[197:46.96]Triangle, XX, triangle.
[197:51.37]Triangle, triangle, square.
[197:52.35]I haven't even done this move.
[197:56.43]I have a lot of points to spend.
[198:02.33]Ooh.
[198:05.90]Alright, I'm gonna upgrade Gandalf's shit.
[198:11.51]This magic shield causes increased damage and persists.
[198:14.26]Magic shield?
[198:14.94]I have to deal with somebody's special move, for the love of God.
[198:22.04]Wink now?
[198:22.88]No.
[198:24.20]Not yet.
[198:26.34]And I'm going to do... Yeah, better lightning bolt.
[198:33.37]I already have this.
[198:38.79]And fire.
[198:39.29]Yeah, that's what I want.
[198:42.14]There's no opportunity for me to do this shit.
[198:45.66]Yeah, that's good enough.
[198:46.42]Alright, here we go.
[198:51.72]You want to wink?
[198:52.12]I just did it.
[198:55.64]It just happened.
[198:57.16]I was in the middle of it when I turned off the camera.
[198:59.50]But you got what you wanted.
[199:19.50]Alright, now... Where are we at now?
[199:21.80]Is this another wink?
[199:31.03]20 minutes?
[199:31.47]No, it wasn't.
[199:34.75]At the top of the wall.
[199:36.13]Ian McKellen.
[199:38.07]Oh, Ian McKellen.
[199:45.20]I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[199:50.26]I am on a summer's day in the headquarters in England of EA.
[199:57.82]This is me doing the crack?
[199:59.20]What the fuck is this?
[200:00.48]The game which people can now play.
[200:03.66]It's a curiosity of Gandalf's that there are many of us.
[200:07.38]What's this image?
[200:08.58]But then when I was making the film, there was my double.
[200:11.68]And there was the stunt Gandalfs, the ones who did the fights in their twelves.
[200:15.84]And then there's the digitalized Gandalfs, who are sometimes seen in the crowd scenes in the film.
[200:21.95]Then there's the Gandalf of this game.
[200:25.39]Gandalf is 7,000 years old, but he can do the most remarkable things, and he's still got... Damn, that's a long time.
[200:32.17]And I only wish that Gandalf in the film had been quite as agile as Gandalf in the game.
[200:40.14]Imagine being alive for that long.
[200:42.78]Imagine being alive and being able to see the dinosaurs become extinct.
[200:45.62]That's too much info to have.
[200:48.03]Let's go back to our hobbit crew.
[201:11.93]No, I know 7,000 years is not 7 million.
[201:14.49]I'm just saying, if you were immortal, you would just watch whole civilization.
[201:18.68]No, I wouldn't want to do that.
[201:19.66]1,000 years would be fun, though.
[201:22.75]You'd live 1,000 years.
[201:23.95]That's kind of interesting.
[201:24.77]I wouldn't want to live forever.
[201:45.75]Gollum's treachery may yet be the ruin of our plans, but only guide Frodo to his doom.
[201:52.05]Do you really want to live forever?
[202:00.46]He's leading us into a trap.
[202:07.77]Remember, you look like Gollum.
[202:08.75]You look like Gollum.
[202:09.41]He actually has your facial features.
[202:11.07]You kind of look like him.
[202:11.89]Yeah, I know.
[202:12.45]That's funny.
[202:20.11]Okay, Samwise.
[202:21.47]Mr. Frodo is counting on you to rescue him no matter what.
[202:23.87]This is a maze level.
[202:35.84]Spider!
[202:38.52]What?
[202:38.72]I can't step on them?
[202:42.02]Can I burn them?
[202:46.35]You won't stop me at home!
[202:57.79]Alright, what's the, what's the new combo?
[202:59.17]It's... It's triangle, triangle, circle, triangle, X, X, what is it?
[203:09.16]X, triangle, X, triangle, X, X. He doesn't even have it, he's level 3, goddammit.
[203:13.82]Right, he's level 3.
[203:15.00]Why would he have that?
[203:36.38]This is embarrassing.
[203:37.30]Just die.
[203:37.88]Just... Sam.
[203:41.64]Sam, this is embarrassing.
[203:44.70]You're embarrassing me.
[203:49.73]Say the line?
[203:51.59]Say the line.
[203:52.17]Say the line.
[203:53.03]Um... Okay.
[203:56.59]Well, it's not... I can't say it yet.
[204:00.64]It's not accurate yet.
[204:10.23]What's this character's name?
[204:11.03]Shelob?
[204:13.69]Damn.
[204:14.11]Alright, where is he?
[204:28.99]I just heard him say, like, Sam, help me.
[204:44.55]Use Fierce Attack.
[204:45.29]Use Fierce Attack.
[204:46.05]Use Fierce Attack.
[204:46.87]Should I use Fierce Attack, or should I use something else?
[205:00.26]Oh my goodness.
[205:04.64]Mmm, works like charm, actually.
[205:08.48]No health away!
[205:16.35]Oh, this is a grim scene.
[205:17.77]Oh, shit.
[205:27.38]I didn't know that was going to do that.
[205:29.32]Alright, let's go.
[205:31.12]Come here.
[205:32.08]Give me this.
[205:36.02]Move.
[205:37.80]I'm coming, Frodo.
[205:49.50]Burn it!
[205:54.88]I'm gonna fuckin' burst if I don't hear that line in ten seconds.
[205:57.90]Somehow I have to get home.
[206:03.39]Relax!
[206:05.37]The army moved out, aren't they?
[206:08.55]We're going to Gondor!
[206:09.99]We're gonna burn it!
[206:17.04]That didn't do anything?
[206:17.92]What?

[214:22.40]Fellowship of the Ring.
[214:24.20]Alright, what's the best Lord of the Rings movie?
[214:28.27]Now that's a real debate for this chat here.
[214:30.81]What's the best Lord of the Rings movie?
[214:32.61]Which one?
[214:33.01]That's not what I wanted to do.
[214:39.65]Really?
[214:44.70]Fellowship?
[214:45.40]Fellowship is pretty good.
[214:48.30]It's probably two towers for me.
[214:50.28]Yeah, it's two towers for me.
[214:52.34]Return of the King is really good, but it's two towers, I think.
[214:55.40]At least for me.
[214:59.59]Oh, shit.
[215:04.41]Oh, shit.
[215:04.91]There's so many here.
[215:12.77]It's the best trilogy ever made?
[215:13.99]Oh, absolutely.
[215:15.08]I don't think anything comes close.
[215:20.86]I'm here, Mr. Frodo.
[215:22.34]I'm here.
[215:24.98]What comes close?
[215:25.60]What's the trilogy that comes... Is it too late?
[215:34.85]Oh, well, shit.
[215:35.55]Here we go.
[215:38.03]Come on, you filth!
[215:43.25]Do I have to pick him up?
[215:44.37]Alright, what's the strategy here?
[215:47.87]Block?
[215:51.00]Block?
[215:52.18]Block and then go in with a couple of swings?
[215:56.30]Yeah, it looks like it's just block, block, swing.
[216:04.67]Maybe not.
[216:06.09]I don't think that's what I have to do.
[216:12.82]Okay, what happens in the movie?
[216:14.24]Doesn't he do something in the movie?
[216:17.20]Giant enemy spider!
[216:18.52]They're all done.
[216:19.16]Okay, good.
[216:19.42]Did I just keep running?
[216:45.83]We should run forward.
[216:47.49]Wait.
[216:50.41]I think it's just walk, walk, walk, and fight.
[217:05.89]I wonder if he... does he do like a charge?
[217:07.61]Oh, it's she, right?
[217:09.31]She won't.
[217:10.55]Alright.
[217:11.63]Um... What about this way?
[217:15.43]Nope.
[217:15.71]I think I just have to fight it.
[217:24.89]I can't really run around.
[217:26.69]Should I throw?
[217:27.27]He keeps backing up so fast.
[217:37.48]I can't even...
[217:46.64]Okay, I'm dead.
[217:47.20]I've got a lot of health.
[218:01.93]Try to get her back to the... Yeah, I'll try to get her back to the wall.

[234:05.53]I should get it.
[234:17.76]Alright, you just gotta kill them the second that they land.
[234:21.66]You have more than three people around you.
[234:23.34]You're just fucked.
[234:34.01]Alright, watch out for the body slam.

[240:29.40]I can't believe there's still more coming in.
[240:37.37]The final four levels, let's see.
[240:39.41]Oh, hold on.
[240:40.25]Elijah Wood!
[240:40.79]Let's see what Elijah has to say.
[240:42.73]One ring to rule them all.
[240:46.35]One ring to fight them.
[240:49.01]One ring to bring them all.
[240:50.83]Let the darkness fight them.
[240:56.61]Frodo never gets to join in in any battles in the film.
[241:01.93]So I was always the one that was really weak and burdened by the ring.
[241:06.03]And in this, I get to take Frodo on some adventures that he didn't actually get to go on.
[241:09.87]I'm a playable character now.
[241:12.44]That's the best.
[241:15.11]style combat's kind of a little clunkier it's not as it's not as finessed as aragorn or certainly legolas would be potatoes kind of fighting very straightforward I thought that was him falling down the stairs for a second to sort of be able to take my character from the film and to be able to kind of implement that into the game is is pretty awesome I shall take up this terrible task choosing Frodo you're also choosing the ring bear so that's pretty cool I'm kind of biased
[241:47.45]Nice.
[241:47.89]Alright, here's Tirith... Tirith Tingle.
[241:52.65]Black Gate.
[241:56.77]Should I do the worst mission in the whole game?
[241:59.87]Or should I wait?
[242:01.92]I'm gonna do... I'll do this one first.
[242:03.48]We'll get Sam's storyline out of the way.
[242:18.84]How long have I been streaming?
[242:19.98]Four hours?
[242:22.14]Just about four hours?
[242:23.06]Mr. Frodo's up in that tower.
[242:24.14]And to get myself up there, I've got to find a way to feed all these orcs.
[242:27.94]Up there is the door, if I can find a way out.
[242:48.24]Damn, just go in.
[242:49.82]He's doing work.
[243:07.15]Better than Gandalf.
[243:17.95]What does this do?
[243:21.39]Use another combo?
[243:22.53]I don't think I can even use the other combos yet, can I?
[243:24.45]He's only level 4.
[243:30.36]Just kill me so I can do it the way the game's supposed to be played.
[243:32.34]80.
[243:39.50]Yeah, that's gonna be horrible.
[243:47.19]This makes me want to play Shadow War Alright, so I have a cloak Is there a way I can
[244:18.00]Climb up?
[244:18.50]I guess I've been spotted, probably.
[244:21.18]Is there even a way I can get over here?
[244:23.60]Hold on, let me look at this first.
[244:26.85]Okay, well, let's just let more of them come down.
[244:30.85]Cool.
[244:31.47]Alright.
[244:35.43]They're fighting each other?
[244:37.43]They are fighting each other.
[244:41.99]Why are they fighting each other right now?
[244:58.82]Are they dead?
[245:01.38]Do I have to kill everybody?
[245:03.40]Or just do I personally have to kill 80?
[245:05.63]I don't get it, really.
[245:06.71]Am I going to run all the way by all these guys and not... Let me see.
[245:19.96]Can I...
[245:24.17]Instant perfect mode?
[245:25.57]For doing that?
[245:26.15]Holy shit.
[245:29.05]Alright, these guys... These guys are a huge pain in the ass to fight.
[245:54.12]Did I hit myself in the head with my own weapon?
[246:03.49]Alright, so can I activate the... To get myself up there, I've got to find a way to feed all these orcs.
[246:23.20]Can I turn this on while I'm cloaked, or no?
[246:25.92]I move so slow when I'm cloaked, though.
[246:30.28]Can I turn this on when I'm cloaked?
[246:34.03]Okay, that was alright.
[246:37.47]That was alright!
[246:46.71]Jesus!
[246:49.99]Jesus!
[246:52.50]How do I reliably take care of these guys?
[246:58.92]Could drop the fire on them.
[247:01.14]Come here.
[247:02.39]Come right here.
[247:04.57]Come over here.
[247:06.83]What the hell is this guy doing?
[247:10.21]What are you doing?
[247:11.89]What?
[247:12.15]Is he just taunting?
[247:14.17]Get the fuck over here.
[247:15.09]Oh my fucking god, seriously.
[247:19.94]What the hell are you doing?
[247:28.22]Thank you.
[247:48.34]What the hell was that?
[247:50.80]Whatever, I'll take it.
[247:55.34]Who's taunting, too?
[247:57.38]Roll around on the ground, man.
[248:05.59]Can I look at the combos?
[248:06.37]I want to look at the combos.
[248:09.07]Can I see that?
[248:10.23]Joe upgrades.
[248:10.77]There we go.
[248:11.69]Alright, I can do Final Judgment.
[248:13.69]Balrog's Gambit's the other one.
[248:15.49]That's the one I'm thinking of.
[248:16.70]X-Circle Triangle.
[248:21.42]There it is.
[248:28.70]Swing.
[248:29.02]Swing.
[248:31.12]Somebody swing.
[248:33.82]I'm invincible right here, right?
[248:48.08]Alright, no, no, no.
[248:49.06]I cannot fight this guy one-on-one.
[248:50.94]It's just instantly losing.
[248:53.04]So I need to... What?
[248:56.46]What the fuck am I looking at?
[248:57.88]What is going on?
[248:59.69]Wait, what's going on?

[249:19.43]Wait, isn't this a- Uh, okay.

[249:44.69]He's coming.
[249:49.37]Alright, what?
[249:53.83]I'm trying to do the Orc Bane, but it won't work.
[250:03.43]I need health bad.
[250:05.57]God.
[250:10.02]Can I get hit by a stray blade?
[250:11.32]Okay, I'm dead.
[250:32.31]I'm in trouble.
[250:46.41]Oh no, Jerm, are you doing this again?
[250:47.91]Well, it's a different game.
[250:48.71]But yes.
[250:50.86]Yes, for some reason I've decided that I was going to play this one too.
[250:54.32]Yep.
[250:58.38]You're right.
[251:04.41]Burn!
[251:04.75]Get in there!

[255:01.70]Okay, and then keep parrying, keep parrying, keep parrying, keep parrying.
[255:06.51]Nope, that's not going to happen.

[255:46.54]Can I just drop it again?
[255:48.38]It's gonna recharge, right?
[255:53.80]Okay, new plan.
[255:54.68]Don't move from this spot.

[260:32.84]What?
[260:33.06]What?
[260:53.22]How many is many?
[260:54.86]That's a great question.
[260:57.85]That's a really good question.
[261:01.75]$2,700.
[261:01.77]$2,700 is a lot of money.
[261:04.01]How many is many?
[261:05.09]That's a good question.
[261:07.67]This is from Heartbroken Samurai.
[261:11.68]He misses his fans bits.
[261:13.32]Well, I don't want to lose this and have to start over again.
[261:16.30]26 is not.
[261:20.93]No, it's usually 50.
[261:21.59]I'm going to be completely honest.
[261:23.59]It's usually like 5,000.
[261:25.69]That's usually what happens, right?
[261:28.27]Let's be completely real.
[261:29.75]That's what happens.
[261:31.44]To midstream stop it, that's what we do usually.
[261:37.98]I typically don't stop until, you know, in the middle of a stream to do hits or subs or anything.
[261:43.38]Unless it's like something, that's just kind of the way it is.
[261:49.25]But let's read it.
[261:49.93]I mean, I've already started, so.
[261:52.05]He only reads $50 donations on stream.
[261:54.39]Well, I actually don't read any.
[261:58.38]Unless they're something significant like that.
[262:00.56]It's just kind of the way the stream is run.
[262:01.84]You guys know that.
[262:05.18]We do it at the end of the stream.
[262:06.12]You guys don't know this.
[262:06.80]Why are we acting like this is some new thing?
[262:08.86]I've been doing this for like three years.
[262:12.24]Anyways, Heartbroken Samurai.
[262:14.18]I gave some money here.
[262:16.99]Hey, Jerma, can you ask my girlfriend, uh, Jerma, can you ask my girlfriend I'd watching your stream?
[262:24.32]She loves Lord of the Rings.
[262:25.32]Can you tell her congrats on school and ask her if I'll... Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on a second.
[262:34.20]Let me just, like... Let me move this out of the way.
[262:39.42]Ow, shit!
[262:40.86]I spilt it.
[262:42.59]It's not codes.
[262:44.43]It's not... Ask her if... Hold on.
[262:48.62]Hey.
[262:51.32]Congratulations on school, by the way.
[262:53.32]Ask her congratulations about school.
[262:55.82]This is... Congratulations on school.
[262:58.74]He said ask her about school.
[263:00.24]By the way, ask her if I'll marry her.
[263:04.03]I love you, Christian.
[263:13.93]I fucked that up pretty bad.
[263:15.57]I'm not gonna lie.
[263:16.89]I like, I like knocked over a battery.
[263:23.25]I knocked over a battery.
[263:24.23]You guys, that's why you wanted me to do it?
[263:25.87]Okay, that's why you wanted me to... Hey!
[263:29.14]And what was it?
[263:30.34]What was it?
[263:44.64]Oh shit.
[263:46.06]Oh, I'm so sad.
[263:47.02]I'm so embarrassed and sad.

[264:00.89]Oh, this is bad.
[264:01.85]Oh, this is really bad.
[264:04.91]Oh my god.
[264:06.72]And that's why you guys are saying... Hey.

[266:50.05]Congratulations, you two.
[266:57.78]That makes me feel good.

[267:14.00]For future reference.
[267:15.70]Before... Alright, if you want me to propose to somebody, then write in brackets before... Like, put it in parentheses and say, Hey, don't read this, but I gotta ask you something.
[267:27.57]Like, don't read this, but like, hey.
[267:29.75]You gotta let me in.
[267:30.39]I gotta be in on it.
[267:39.94]You'd read that out loud.
[267:40.88]No, no, I would read the first, I would read the, hey, don't read this out loud part.
[267:44.20]And then I'd go, oh.

[268:06.03]Why did they do this?
[268:07.11]Why would they do this?
[268:12.73]I'm stuck in the corner.
[268:15.04]Use it!
[268:16.08]Why won't he do it?
[268:25.72]He's chasing me, he's chasing me, he's chasing me.
[268:36.16]Oh my fucking god, thank jeez.
[268:40.90]You made that more memorable.
[268:42.14]Yeah, you'll never forget that.
[268:44.12]You'll never forget it.
[268:44.80]That was a good double leg drop.
[268:48.08]Okay, what the fuck am I doing?
[269:17.64]Okay, I need to throw something at you, or what am I doing here?
[269:22.61]Okay.
[269:23.51]The shield is broken.
[269:26.97]Not another she-lob fight where you do this bullshit.
[269:35.07]I'll throw another fucking... I'm throwing another one at you, fuck off.
[269:40.17]He's dazed.
[269:40.69]Did I just wake him up?
[269:46.77]What's going on?
[269:47.33]Was I not supposed to do that?
[269:49.49]Oh, I get it
[270:16.72]Whoa, I thought he was dazed.
[270:28.86]Where's he going?
[270:30.20]He's getting a shield.
[270:31.12]Oh!
[270:33.98]Oh, that's not funny.
[270:36.03]That's not funny.
[270:37.11]I just tried to jump.
[270:38.33]That's how you know how fucked up I am right now.
[270:49.38]Come on, don't fuck it up here, really.
[270:51.22]You're gonna chase me around a fucking circle.
[270:54.98]How am I gonna do this?
[270:55.78]This dude's always gonna chase me around a circle now.
[271:06.87]Quick, again!
[271:15.13]I'm waiting.
[271:15.43]Here he comes.
[271:30.50]It's so scary when he just disappears on the screen.
[271:38.50]Oh, he's running so fast.
[271:40.65]Oh my fuck!
[271:49.27]Come on, come on, Sam, Sam!
[271:52.93]Oh, fuck you!
[271:58.50]Come on, get up in this place, get up!
[272:04.42]Okay, we're alright here.
[272:06.30]We're doing fine.
[272:07.46]We're good.
[272:08.76]Video games are all fucking the same.
[272:11.79]They're all bad.
[272:15.47]Come on, Mr. Frodo.
[272:16.85]I know the way out of here.
[272:21.36]Phylactery, let's get 5,000 bits.
[272:22.68]Don't read... Hey, chat, I'm fucking huge.
[272:24.59]Go fuck yourself.
[272:25.91]Hey, Phylactery, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[272:53.40]That's a lot of perfects.
[273:01.23]You've ruined that guy's marriage.
[273:06.55]Alright.
[273:06.95]Cloak of Celebration.
[273:08.13]What do I do?
[273:09.11]Oh, it's just longer?
[273:10.03]Increases the time.
[273:12.95]Boop.
[273:14.07]Everybody gets that move.
[273:15.65]Which is a pretty big deal.
[273:17.57]And attacking Uruk.
[273:18.81]Yep.
[273:23.19]get it what else does he not have what's this thing little six yeah just get it it sucks so much this is the move that no one ever uses in this game I'm certain of it
[273:52.23]You have so many points, just buy everything.
[273:53.83]I mean, I could.
[273:59.81]Alright.
[274:01.14]We're at the final three missions of the video game.
[274:11.92]Okay.
[274:13.56]But... Film production stills.
[274:17.84]Take a look.
[274:26.58]Stop pinging.
[274:28.11]I knew that was... I recognized that from somewhere.
[274:32.50]That actually is like a MOBA ping.
[274:56.76]That's cool.
[274:57.26]Alright, here we are.
[275:00.94]We're at the... I'm going to have to... I'm going to breathe in for a little bit on this one.
[275:06.89]A few people have told me during the course of this stream so far.
[275:11.03]This level sucks.
[275:12.49]You're going to hate this thing.
[275:13.59]You're going to hate this level.
[275:14.77]You're going to have no fun playing this.
[275:17.83]So I'm just going to get ready.
[275:22.90]I'm prepared.
[275:23.92]I'm going to play.
[275:25.40]Whatever.
[275:25.94]Let's go.
[275:46.62]It will require all of my skill and all of our luck to spring a trap lifetimes in the making.
[275:56.49]In the end, it will be decided here, upon the fields of Pelennor, before the gates of Minas Tirith.
[276:06.31]From the south, Aragorn will summon forth an army from beyond the grave.
[276:11.58]But perhaps too late.
[276:14.04]Uh-oh.
[276:16.06]For against our stronghold, the Dark Lord summons both man and beast to oppose us.
[276:23.77]An army of powerful forces, more terrible than we can imagine.
[276:28.13]Does this happen in the movie?
[276:30.47]I feel like some of these scenes I don't remember seeing.
[276:33.35]Rohan shall ride to war and the world's ending.
[276:47.42]Here we go.
[276:47.92]Best song in the whole world.
[276:56.47]They don't, actually.
[277:16.81]Roger, I'm up here again.
[277:19.67]They seem to have taken into the desert of Las Vegas.
[277:28.02]No, we're not doing that again.
[277:36.88]It seems there seems to be... There seems to be 5,000 more people than before.
[277:41.13]It looks like a big social media campaign must have happened for both sides here.
[277:59.50]Kill this guy, come on.
[278:11.98]Bang!
[278:14.42]Bang!
[278:26.25]You know what I'm swinging at.
[278:31.43]Come on, knock in... What?
[278:32.83]He's 50% of my health!
[278:49.64]I can't even tell if these guys are on my team or not.
[279:42.66]Yeah, it's been fun.
[279:43.54]Come on.
[279:45.73]You're making me nuts here.
[279:49.83]You're making me nuts.
[279:51.93]You're going nuts right now.
[279:53.41]I'm going to go fucking nuts.
[280:06.52]Look.
[280:07.54]Look, I don't...
[280:12.48]Are you telling me there's no health over here?
[280:23.49]Finally.
[280:24.43]What kind of video game doesn't have extra HP health?
[280:28.48]The Mumakil destroy everything in their path.
[280:31.12]Stop them before they reach Eowyn and Merry.
[280:34.89]Alright, so we gotta... Oh, I remember this part.
[280:37.95]Kind of.
[280:38.92]My brain remembers this and my brain remembers hating this.
[280:42.10]Right?
[280:42.34]Or something?
[280:42.66]My brain hated this.
[280:44.84]Did that do anything?
[280:48.29]What just happened?
[280:50.33]Why is there only one?
[281:02.03]I need to do it.
[281:02.77]Oh, right.
[281:03.15]Okay.
[281:03.79]I thought there was like five.
[281:06.37]Oh, it's over.
[281:07.81]I fucked it up.
[281:15.00]I actually got it.
[281:15.54]Okay.
[281:16.60]Did it?
[281:16.96]Okay, here we go.
[281:24.22]There's two here on this side.
[281:30.18]Okay, let's go.
[281:31.96]There we go.
[281:33.69]Should I run across?
[281:35.13]Should I run down and run across?
[281:38.33]Should I go across?
[281:41.03]This way?
[281:41.53]Okay.
[281:42.37]Can't wait for a save.
[281:43.65]And we're going to enter now.
[281:45.71]1, 2, 3.
[281:45.89]Okay.
[281:49.30]Okay, now it's a good time.
[281:53.16]Oh, okay.
[281:54.10]Not right.
[281:56.24]Incorrected.
[281:56.60]Apparently not right.
[281:58.06]Okay.
[281:58.20]Okay.
[282:00.47]Run down?
[282:02.99]No, I just... No?
[282:11.32]Do I have to go down?
[282:21.04]Why would they put me over here?
[282:22.14]If I'm actually... I'm supposed to run all the way down.
[282:28.53]No, you guys are fucking kidding me.
[282:32.83]Oh, what a joke.
[282:36.09]No, that's not what I'm supposed to do, actually.
[282:43.34]I tried to shoot the first one.
[282:44.58]It didn't even hit!
[282:48.76]You tell me this is gonna hit?
[282:49.52]That didn't even do anything.
[282:54.23]Oh, how does that miss?
[282:55.03]I don't understand.
[282:57.33]That doesn't make any sense.
[282:59.63]I didn't even hit.
[283:00.21]I didn't even hit.
[283:00.73]That was lined up right in the fucking back.
[283:02.30]On the guy's back.
[283:03.26]Wrong side of the map.
[283:04.00]I can't even go down.
[283:31.39]What does Mary and Pippin even have a health bar?
[283:33.81]Alright, so I have to go all the way down in a round?
[283:38.69]Or will these hit the second one?
[283:50.24]So go down, but how the fuck do I even get down?
[283:52.50]I think you made a mark.
[284:07.15]Just go down.
[284:09.99]There is no go down.
[284:15.30]I can't go down from here.
[284:38.53]Oh, come on.
[284:48.22]Do it.
[284:55.24]Can I go down here?
[285:02.82]What a stupid fucking thing.
[285:05.46]What an actually absolutely ridiculous fucking place to put that.
[285:16.65]Well, now I know where that is.
[285:19.99]And that happens in the books?
[285:32.72]Yeah.
[285:36.26]Then Gimli and crew walked by and down the 2D plane, which actually is a 3D plane that switches the camera 180 fucking degrees the other direction.
[286:00.21]Dude, read the books.
[286:04.77]It happens.
[286:10.99]And then Lord of the Rings Return of the King broke the number one fucking rule of all cinema.
[286:16.87]Breaking the 180 degree line.
[286:18.72]Alright, where the hell is this?
[286:25.64]Where's the way to get up?
[286:30.92]Can I go like up?
[286:32.51]How do I go up?
[286:33.15]They're gonna die again.
[286:46.83]Can I go up?
[286:48.73]Where can I go up?
[286:49.79]Oh my god!
[287:10.14]Shoot it!
[287:10.70]Remember, he's just standing still!
[287:25.79]I don't even know how I got up here.
[287:26.91]And that was a... Ah!
[287:38.12]I don't wanna... Oh, does he?
[287:43.48]Quick!
[287:44.52]Throw a wrench at him!
[287:45.56]Is this working?
[287:56.69]Is he gone?
[287:57.19]I don't fucking know.
[287:59.69]Is this dude gone?
[288:05.32]We gotta go back down.
[288:07.44]But do we?
[288:11.09]Oh, not another one of these fucking things.
[288:13.03]Is it on the same side as me?
[288:21.86]Is it on the same side?
[288:22.48]Or is it on the other side?
[288:23.56]Same side or the side?
[288:24.28]Same side or the side?
[288:24.92]Same side or the side?
[288:26.60]What side is it on?
[288:32.80]Same side?
[288:33.18]I think it's on the same side.
[288:34.24]It's on the same side.
[288:44.87]I fucking thought you guys are Aragorn and Legolas.
[288:52.13]Good to know those fucking things work Where is it?
[289:09.65]Down?
[289:10.17]Up?
[289:11.43]Here he comes again Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[289:17.85]I gotta throw shit at him.
[289:19.00]He's over here
[289:21.08]Stay away!
[289:21.44]Stay away!
[289:24.25]You fucking dickhead!
[289:25.67]Get out of here!
[289:33.11]Alright, alright.
[289:33.57]He's gone.
[289:33.81]He's gone.
[289:37.43]It's gonna be the other way, I'm assuming.
[289:38.61]It's probably gonna be another one on the other side.
[289:39.95]It's just right across.
[289:44.01]Same side?
[289:44.61]Is he gone?
[289:45.03]Oh, he's on this side.
[289:47.21]He's still on this side.
[289:49.05]I'm getting lucky here.
[290:00.44]That was a really, really, really lucky fucking super heal.
[290:07.57]Right in the head.
[290:22.71]Will one of you please do anything?

[290:38.49]You two fucking idiots.
[290:41.55]You're in the movie.

[302:29.13]It's getting a little...
[302:31.09]They've been over here the whole time just killing people.
[302:34.45]They've just been feeding people over here.
[302:37.09]And these guys have been killing every single one.
[302:41.31]How the fuck?
[302:47.09]What am I hitting?
[302:47.67]A fucking statue?
[303:03.44]I'm in fucking trouble.
[303:08.38]I'm working on it.
[303:17.93]As easy as it looks, lady.
[303:23.87]Health, somewhere.
[303:34.84]Fuck, this sucks.
[303:42.94]Glad to see you gave this masterpiece another go.
[303:45.59]Oh, this is the last one.
[303:48.71]I beat the last one.
[303:49.87]This is Return of the King.
[303:50.77]Okay.
[304:21.58]Whenever I get perfect, there's nobody ever fucking to swing at.
[304:28.28]You got him.
[304:30.01]Aye, aye.
[304:30.49]That move's really not that good.
[304:40.33]It just takes too long.
[304:41.35]It barely hits anybody on the ground either.
[304:52.28]Like, I can't... Why is it... Hit him.
[304:53.80]Finish him on the ground.
[304:54.74]Like, what the fuck?
[304:57.12]Perfect.
[304:57.94]Let's go.
[305:02.39]Come on.
[305:20.48]And yet again, there's literally no one to attack.
[305:22.76]They come in waves of six.
[305:23.94]Here we go.
[305:35.10]Everyone, stop in the middle.
[305:36.50]Do one move and it kills them.
[305:37.52]Pull him up.
[305:52.26]Alright, time to look around.
[305:56.20]Nobody over there.
[305:56.78]Nobody over here.
[306:00.75]People are free to come in, right?
[306:03.61]That way.
[306:04.03]Everybody safe?
[306:11.63]Okay.
[306:21.91]I get hit by every single fucking one of those.
[306:26.51]I'm just bouncing off this fucking thing.
[306:42.27]Alright, can we?
[306:55.51]I need help.
[307:03.74]Good.
[307:03.90]You got the shield off.
[307:04.70]You did a full four move combo.
[307:10.04]Catapult flame attack?
[307:11.00]What does that mean?
[307:11.42]Do I have to do that?
[307:21.17]Take his...

[307:27.64]Alright, let's go, let's go, go, go, go, go.

[307:40.19]When he was talking shit.
[307:41.17]Alright, I got a couple barrels here.
[307:48.33]I gotta break that armor off of him.
[308:01.59]You know, don't you just love looking through a telescope?
[308:05.07]It's just like, great.
[308:08.88]That it?
[308:23.00]Why did I not pick this up when he was dead?
[308:26.30]I'm actually getting slightly annoyed by this.
[308:41.26]Just slightly annoyed.
[308:45.74]Are we alright?
[308:57.78]Everyone's fine, right?
[309:02.03]Jerma's full mooning right now?
[309:03.55]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[309:06.53]No, I'm not.
[309:07.02]I'm not full mooning.
[309:09.10]This is not a full moon.
[309:10.10]What are you talking about?
[309:10.94]Why am I standing here?
[309:23.87]Oh, no.
[309:29.35]I killed him instantly.
[309:30.91]Why did he die instantly?
[309:33.07]Why did he just die instantly?
[309:35.34]That was ridiculous.
[309:36.24]I think I just got a... I think I just got a... I think I got a... Alright, slow down.

[310:17.67]I need a barrel.
[310:19.41]Barrel over here.
[310:24.77]As long as thirty more people go across.
[310:26.12]Who cares?
[310:28.68]Just 30 of you have run in.
[310:30.65]You're going to be alright.
[310:31.95]Just get in.
[310:33.80]One more barrel here.
[310:35.76]Nothing even in there.
[310:38.11]172.
[310:38.13]Alright, here we go.
[310:40.15]How did you get in here?
[310:42.92]Why is there a troll at the door?
[310:49.88]Why is there a troll at the door?
[310:51.87]Is this a troll at the door?
[310:53.81]It's blocking every path.
[310:57.03]Okay.
[310:57.81]So, um, just get in.
[311:00.19]Go on.
[311:01.01]You'll be alright.

[312:11.62]Somebody, you got in.
[312:12.85]Okay, good.
[312:14.05]Only 10 more of you need to get in.
[312:15.21]10 more.
[312:18.17]Hopefully, one of you can squeeze through.
[312:21.29]189.
[312:22.75]190.
[312:22.89]I ain't fucking doing anything.
[312:29.45]I'm not doing shit.
[312:30.19]I'm going to stay in and just block and 200 of them are going to get in.
[312:39.14]This is Lemmings.
[312:45.42]Come on, you can do it.
[312:47.48]You can do it.

[313:18.52]Defend us, you fucking asshole.
[313:28.17]Oh.
[313:34.92]A hundred bucks came in from Cyclops Parker.
[313:36.60]10,000 bits two or three minutes ago.
[313:37.74]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[313:39.84]They say, hey Jerma, just wanted to do some big bits to distract you from the game a little bit.
[313:46.40]Glad I could catch the stream live.
[314:06.12]Thanks for the 10,000 bits, man.
[314:09.75]Not in the marriage, no.
[314:21.36]That was ridiculous.
[314:24.82]The distraction technique?
[314:27.14]No, distraction technique... Not gonna work right now.
[314:31.44]Not when I have to do 18 minute long timed levels.
[314:41.37]What do you got?
[314:42.11]I haven't even used this.
[314:43.01]I don't even know what this looks like.
[314:45.27]I haven't used it once.
[314:45.95]Does Gandalf have anything I don't have that is worth buying?
[314:53.42]What's this?
[314:54.10]No, I'm not going to use it.
[314:55.46]I'm really not.
[314:58.00]How was my week off?
[314:58.66]It was great.
[315:00.14]Thanks for asking.
[315:02.10]It was very good.
[315:03.04]Got to see some friends I haven't seen in a long time.
[315:04.84]It was awesome.
[315:06.81]Alright, let's keep going.
[315:15.95]I gotta pee again.
[315:16.65]Anybody that's up to pee?
[315:21.70]Pee before the final two levels?
[315:23.18]What do you think?
[315:27.18]Oh, while I got you all here, let me just go over this.
[315:29.78]So, uh... Tomorrow... We're streaming tomorrow.
[315:33.57]But, um... I have physical therapy tomorrow.
[315:36.89]So... The stream tomorrow is gonna start a little later.
[315:40.29]It's not gonna start around, like, two.
[315:43.71]The stream tomorrow is gonna be probably somewhere around...
[315:48.25]Uh, let's see.
[315:51.35]It's gonna be a late one tomorrow.
[315:52.85]It's gonna start somewhere probably around... It's gonna start probably around 6 p.m.
[315:56.69]Pacific, if I'm honest.
[316:01.14]I'm gonna be honest.
[316:08.08]That's really late.
[316:08.94]Yeah, it is.
[316:09.40]6 p.m.
[316:13.84]Pacific tomorrow.
[316:18.36]But this is the Black Gate.
[316:19.54]Let's take a break and go pee.
[316:21.79]I'll be right back.
[316:24.21]This will probably be the last pee of the night, I would assume.
[316:26.47]I don't know.
[316:27.21]Two pees.
[316:27.59]We'll find out.
[318:41.38]Okay.
[318:44.37]Kermit smells with a burger.
[318:45.45]Hey, come on.
[318:47.45]What the heck?
[318:48.73]What did I do to you?
[318:56.03]You bet he's eating baby food right now?
[318:58.53]Uh, ding ding ding.
[319:00.17]What do we have for the winner?
[319:00.90]Shellwood?
[319:09.52]Shellwood?
[319:23.41]People think I'm a liar.
[319:26.01]I'm not.
[319:32.82]Which is what I do.
[319:34.12]Alright, the black gate.
[319:36.32]Here we go.
[319:43.65]There's absolutely no way I'm going to do this as a game like this.
[319:46.73]Gandalf.
[319:58.94]My plans have ended in a day of great sacrifice.
[320:03.42]Gondor lies shattered in the greatest battle of our age.
[320:09.23]But the enemy regroups, and our war is not yet won.
[320:14.51]For the Ring still survives.
[320:19.13]The last living men have witnessed the return of their king.
[320:23.95]He has gone unchallenged long enough.
[320:29.03]And together we now ride upon Sauron's realm to create our final diversion.
[320:35.15]For the ring to be thrown into... Give Frodo one last chance.
[320:47.30]I have a token I was bidding to show thee.
[320:50.40]Frostbite.
[320:52.16]Frodo's mithril vest.
[320:54.42]Poor hobbit must be dead.
[320:58.27]I shall give you a message for your master.
[321:03.11]I will give you a magic trick for your master.
[321:05.95]I will turn into Gandalf.
[321:07.19]My master Sauron the Great bids you welcome.
[321:10.67]You shall speak for Sauron no more.
[321:19.34]It's just like a brawl It's like Jerm or rumble levels of combat I
[322:02.27]Give me the perfect!
[322:03.47]Oh, I didn't get it.
[322:03.95]I got it on excellent.
[322:05.55]I guess that concludes negotiations.
[322:08.44]Huh.
[322:18.14]You've drawn his army to the Black Gates.
[322:20.38]For ourselves, there is no hope.
[322:22.53]This is our final act to give Frodo time.
[322:26.07]Time to end this evil that marshals before us.
[322:30.97]Checkpoint.
[322:31.89]Hi.
[322:33.07]Alright.
[322:33.47]Wait a minute Fight fight But get with fight Gimli give me the boss now I
[323:06.11]I could really use some health here.
[323:07.15]That'd be nice.
[323:19.30]Use it!
[323:22.16]What the fuck did that do?
[323:25.12]Yeah, no, this doesn't fucking do anything!
[323:26.59]Is that a mana?
[323:34.31]What did you run out of?
[323:42.37]You can't even do anything.
[323:44.73]Alright, let's go.
[323:50.95]Should have brought potions.
[323:52.33]Alright, let's go.
[323:53.65]Come on.
[323:54.07]This is going to be like a 20 minute long mission.
[323:56.12]I know.
[323:56.50]I know.
[323:56.84]Here we go.
[324:25.36]It's too powerful.

[332:07.48]I hope so.
[332:11.16]Lord Sauron has lost patience.
[332:14.38]Repeat the war, we are lost.
[332:32.33]Dude, can I?
[332:34.72]Get up.
[332:43.79]I got a checkpoint right there.
[332:44.59]It's okay.
[332:46.79]Why couldn't I hit him?
[332:47.43]I was bouncing off of him.
[332:48.39]What the fuck was that?
[333:13.40]Give me a break.
[333:14.22]I don't even know what he's swinging his sword.
[333:17.81]He's not even doing like... You know their weakness.
[333:21.47]Fire!
[333:22.01]Yes, fire!
[333:22.71]Fire, of course, it's fire!
[333:24.03]Use fire!
[333:24.69]Fire, of course, it's fire!
[333:27.93]Sometimes you bounce off, sometimes you don't.
[333:29.45]Use fire!
[333:41.67]Holy shit, these guys are worthless compared to me.
[333:52.64]Oh, I guess I did it.
[333:58.98]Sorry, guys.
[333:59.38]I didn't realize my build is perfect for this.
[334:12.16]It's hard to steal everybody's thunder.
[334:15.50]We now give witness to that day when the courage of men faces the final test.
[334:22.31]Or shall it be an hour of wolves before the age of men comes crashing down?
[334:29.47]The eye of Sauron will be upon us.
[334:32.37]Mistaking our audacity for time.
[334:34.62]You invested everything into the fire tree.
[334:36.72]Must hold his gaze long enough.
[334:38.66]Kind of.
[334:39.00]Unthinkable to become real.
[334:46.51]Please cut the stream.
[334:47.25]I have not seen the movie.
[334:54.55]It's like 110-year-old spoilers at this point.
[334:59.52]I'm sorry.
[335:01.18]That's not on me.
[335:03.60]At this point, this is like saying the T-Rex was a fucking dinosaur at one point.
[335:07.04]I...
[335:11.86]This shit is ancient history.
[335:15.90]A lot of perfects.
[335:22.27]Alright.
[335:23.67]We finally got... Triangle, triangle, triangle.
[335:28.07]Helm's Hammer.
[335:32.79]Pretty sick.
[335:33.23]Triangle, triangle, triangle.
[335:35.75]Triangle.
[335:45.33]One more level.
[335:46.63]There's a lot to spend, so I'm going to save the points.
[335:55.13]I wonder, is this a level 10 scenario?
[336:00.63]Or is the final level just Mount Doom?
[336:02.53]I don't remember.
[336:10.72]This is the end of the movie.
[336:18.81]Crack of Doom.
[336:27.01]Wait, I have to play as level 1 Frodo?
[336:38.54]I've been playing as Sam every time I had a chance.
[336:40.76]You mean I have to do level 1 Frodo now?
[336:42.64]The final level of the game?
[336:47.36]Too bad he's level one.
[336:49.30]Seamless.
[337:18.24]Level 1, look at this.
[337:19.52]Can't even fight back.
[337:27.87]Give that to me!
[337:35.76]I don't have any moves.
[337:39.03]Alright, throw it in there!
[337:41.15]Throw it in there, get in there!
[337:43.57]Throw it in, how did he just jump in?
[337:48.42]Throw it in!
[337:51.72]Throw it in dude, go!
[337:53.02]Throw it!
[338:08.11]Push him!
[338:08.89]Sam, if we push him at the same time, we'll push him off.
[338:11.32]Alright, push him!
[338:15.28]Push!
[338:33.95]It's just Sam.
[338:35.47]Okay.
[338:36.07]Um...
[338:52.23]Hit him, Sam.
[338:53.17]He's distracted.
[338:53.81]Push him, push him, push him!
[339:05.37]Sam, hit him!
[339:07.09]Alright, that's what you gotta do.
[339:07.93]He falls back.
[339:12.96]You won't leave with the ring.
[339:15.12]I promise you that.
[339:31.84]It's scripted.
[339:32.34]It's scripted.
[339:33.66]It's scripted!
[339:34.14]It... A step on his head!
[339:39.60]What?

[339:48.15]Push him!
[339:48.77]Alright, here we go.
[339:53.73]Why?
[339:57.21]I just hit every possible button.
[339:59.41]R1.

[340:12.03]Push him in.
[340:14.93]Push him in.
[340:25.46]Okay.
[340:28.02]I didn't do it.
[340:28.60]Alright, we gotta do that like five more times.

[340:49.99]It's mine.
[340:50.29]Mine.
[341:06.75]And okay.
[341:07.83]Sam, get him.

[341:18.52]Go ahead.
[341:20.94]Hit him.
[341:22.40]There we go.
[341:25.04]Back him up.
[341:26.38]Back him up.
[341:27.50]What the fuck?
[341:34.10]I promise you that.

[342:09.52]Where's he going?
[342:09.92]Back up this way?
[342:10.74]Alright, Sam, get in.
[342:18.36]Oh, health.
[342:21.60]Alright, spin him around.

[342:35.93]Push him.
[342:39.24]Stab him in the head.
[342:42.31]Just give him the ring?
[342:44.79]The whole world ends if I do that.
[342:51.15]It's not worth it.
[342:55.71]Alright, spin around and push.
[343:04.32]Push him.
[343:14.12]Again.
[343:14.81]Here we go.
[343:17.45]Oh, come on.
[343:18.09]Fuck that.
[343:18.53]Watch him.
[343:22.23]Get over the edge, man.
[343:24.75]You're killing me.
[343:34.10]Alright.
[343:34.44]Go on.
[343:35.66]Why is he doing all these flips?
[343:44.04]Dude, I can't make him do anything!

[344:32.85]Why did he... Why?
[344:35.81]I have no idea what he's doing.
[344:47.45]Do I just have to wait until he accidentally finds himself in the perfect spot to fall off the edge?
[344:51.13]I can't push him.
[344:52.53]I can't hurt him.
[344:53.13]I can't do anything.
[344:54.17]Fall!
[344:58.20]So what happened with the other side?
[345:01.34]What the fuck?
[345:18.12]Jeremy, you can't be the joke character.
[345:23.00]He is not the joke character.
[345:24.78]Alright, I mean, okay.
[345:28.98]You could say that Gollum is the Jar Jar Binks of Lord of the Rings.
[345:35.62]But he's like comedy and he... He's got like... He's like the comic relief and he...
[345:50.44]Back!

[346:42.68]What did I say?
[346:43.16]That Gollum was the comic relief character in Lord of the Rings?
[346:55.03]It's like I compared Gollum to Jar Jar Binks.
[347:09.27]Apologize.
[347:12.66]Two relationships ruined today.
[347:19.82]Not this time, Gollum.

[349:45.97]Where is he?
[349:49.17]Where is he?
[349:59.62]Alright, get over here.

[350:07.32]Okay, you can fall now.
[350:12.67]There you go!
[350:17.41]Last one.
[350:18.79]Bye.
[350:19.87]Did let it go.
[350:21.57]That really wasn't that bad.
[350:32.08]This is annoying.
[350:34.94]The ring is destroyed.
[350:37.83]and all that was done by that power is passing away they do it those who were bound to the fate of the one are now free that's real crowded now come the days of the king and may they be blessed while the thrones of the valor endure needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life
[351:00.82]Do you think they're ever gonna do, like, The Ring Awakens?
[351:04.02]And do another trilogy after?
[351:05.52]And Sauron was my enemy.
[351:08.12]I kindled hope.
[351:10.02]The secret fire of Arnald in the hearts of others.
[351:14.78]Sauron, in his greed, found all power in the One.
[351:20.14]As Sauron mingled his own blood with the Ring's gold, so did I mingle myself with my magic.
[351:40.03]Why was that in here?
[351:41.27]Yeah, why is that in here?
[351:43.23]That doesn't even happen in this movie.
[351:47.07]We actually did just watch... We watched all the Lord of the Rings on stream.
[351:51.43]We actually got to do it.
[351:52.59]Oh, fuck.
[352:12.01]That's why they did that.
[352:14.27]It was a shout out for the DVD.
[352:27.81]Three.
[352:34.69]So I'm assuming you can build up... How would you build up your perfect meter and then do the last hit on him?
[352:42.00]Is that how you're supposed to do that?
[352:42.92]That would probably be a huge pain in the ass.
[352:50.80]Well, let's go on a spending spree.
[352:55.34]No, I need to level 10.
[352:57.31]Anybody level 10?
[353:10.90]What's the percentage here?
[353:14.88]80%.
[353:14.90]What's it going to be, like 85%, 86%?
[353:16.14]Who would win in a fight?
[353:25.04]1v1 Gollum versus Jar Jar.
[353:29.24]Jar Jar.
[353:30.22]It would absolutely be Jar Jar.
[353:36.24]It would not be gullible.
[353:36.90]No, it wouldn't be gullible.
[353:39.89]Andy Circe's interview.
[353:43.43]Julie Boyd interview.
[353:47.31]A lot of interviews here.

[354:08.71]I'm not interested at all.
[354:14.41]What is this one?
[354:15.45]Is this a secret level?
[354:22.19]Oh, we can be Sam, Frodo, Pippin, Merry, or Faramir.
[354:29.47]These are great secret characters.
[354:35.22]I'm not going to be able to do this with Faramir.
[354:42.64]No Golem?
[354:43.16]What would his moves be?
[354:44.24]We'll do Gandalf.
[354:52.33]And then I want to see the Andy Serkis interview.
[354:58.97]I shall free the minds of your servants and teach them fear.
[355:02.55]I shall render them useless to you.
[355:06.29]Perfect mode here we go I'm gonna have to kill 20 Helms hammer
[355:32.42]How do I only kill one person?
[355:34.88]Oh, it's waves.

[355:47.33]Come on.
[355:47.53]Come on.
[356:06.75]Kind of slow, but it does a lot of damage.
[356:15.66]You're never going to beat this?
[356:18.32]No, I don't plan on it.
[356:19.44]Bring it together, come on.
[356:23.35]Lots of perfects.
[356:42.84]Wait, you still alive?
[356:43.60]2004 was a good year.
[356:46.30]Yeah, it was.
[356:47.08]It really was?
[356:49.24]Whoa, that's a lot of missiles.
[356:57.99]Can I block them all at the same time and get it perfect?
[357:00.68]Can't check this out.
[357:01.32]Ready?
[357:03.76]Ready?
[357:03.98]Here we go.
[357:04.32]Here we go.
[357:13.42]And here we go!
[357:14.08]Eh, I thought it was going to be way cooler than that, but whatever.
[357:29.15]Stop.
[357:29.69]What?
[357:30.41]You... Alright.
[357:31.67]You... Is that really all it takes to get away the fuck from Gandalf?
[357:38.01]Float backwards of two steps?
[357:43.72]Metroid Prime was... I mean, the 2000s, the early 2000s, like from 2000 to 2010.
[357:49.00]I mean, I don't think there'll be... That rivals somewhere in the mid-90s.
[357:59.41]The heyday of the Super Nintendo and SEGA Genesis, there were some unbeatable games.
[358:03.50]And N64... Think about the shit that came out on N64.
[358:07.16]Oh, man.
[358:08.16]Think about the shit that came out on Super Nintendo in like 94, 95, 96...
[358:15.93]What a great, what a great, like, I was gonna say season.
[358:22.12]He actually thinks the N64 is good.
[358:25.34]Uh, I mean... Super Mario 64 and, like, Zelda games and... We've gotta be kidding.
[358:34.49]The N64... I... What are you guys talking about?
[358:39.15]Angel Kazooie?
[358:40.93]Yeah.
[358:42.58]I think, I think you guys are just messing around.
[358:43.98]Yeah, you have to be.
[358:50.56]What's Banjo-Kazooie?
[358:56.18]Should I even respond to that?
[358:58.05]I feel like that's somebody making a joke.
[359:02.69]Banjo-Kazooie?
[359:03.25]No, I'm not going to respond to it.
[359:04.79]So, I'm going to lose here because I'm not paying attention anymore.
[359:10.11]Ban that person for not knowing what Banjo-Kazooie is?
[359:12.59]That's petty.
[359:14.44]But go ahead and do it.
[359:19.62]Come on, one more.
[359:20.26]Get to seven.
[359:25.82]Shoot the giant egg.
[359:31.77]That is it for me.
[359:35.89]Not even close to as hard as two towers.
[359:37.89]I played in the same difficulty, too.
[359:39.77]Just normal.
[359:42.73]Although I did get really, really, really lucky at the very end of the... at elephant level.
[359:56.11]Easy.
[359:58.87]Can I get to 10?
[360:02.27]This really is not even that bad.
[360:03.35]It's actually kind of fun, but I'm not going to do it.
[360:08.20]Elephant level is the hardest one.
[360:09.22]Yeah.
[360:11.56]I got really lucky.
[360:12.36]I had one health pixel off from losing and doing the whole damn thing again.
[360:25.50]Stop running away.
[360:26.16]That is cheap.
[360:27.28]Alright.
[360:29.58]Well, that has been... You've now seen all the Lord of the Rings trilogy on this stream.
[360:48.93]Thanks for watching.
[360:51.43]Did I unlock something else?
[360:52.25]What's going on?
[360:54.24]Oh, I want to watch the Andy Serkis interview.
[360:57.26]Yeah, this is important.
[360:58.74]What did they steal?
[360:59.60]My precious egg.
[361:11.83]Gollum, for me, was like a major addict who just needed... Yeah, I compared him to Jar Jar Binks.
[361:17.85]That was not incorrect.
[361:18.47]I don't think that was correct.
[361:19.31]Ask of the precious egg.
[361:23.68]Because we're using motion capture a lot, and the animators are watching my performance closely on screen and mapping.
[361:30.63]The keyframe animators are matching every expression.
[361:33.75]His whole facial structure and the way that his face moves is based on the way mine does.
[361:38.51]So it goes through three processes.
[361:40.57]I shoot on set with Elijah and Sean, and we act all the scenes together.
[361:43.99]This guy right here is a pioneer.
[361:46.25]repeating every single scene, and then I do the final voice track.
[361:50.58]Yes, precious.
[361:52.46]The voice was really born out of two things.
[361:56.47]One was trying to find a psychological route into why he speaks like that.
[362:02.54]But actually, in physical terms, it came from... I knew it!
[362:07.33]I knew it was a cat.
[362:11.01]When they cough up furballs, and they kind of go... I like that.
[362:14.81]What do they do?
[362:15.73]Pew?
[362:15.95]Bowling.
[362:16.62]Bowling.
[362:17.50]Bowling.
[362:18.04]Bowling.
[362:20.62]See?
[362:20.76]Great minds think alike, Andy.
[362:21.72]I agree.
[362:22.00]That's kind of weird.
[362:22.62]He did this first?
[362:23.52]He had to do this first before he even did the movie voice acting.
[362:55.61]What's this one down here?
[362:57.01]Nothing here.
[362:57.35]Do I have to get a perfect on every level?
[363:01.71]Uh... Hmm.
[363:05.85]What about, uh... What about Billy... What about Billy Boyd?
[363:10.02]What does Pippin have to say?
[363:12.98]Thank you.
[363:13.48]Like me.
[363:13.78]Okay.
[363:51.69]Take Pippin to... Pippin to Path of the Dead.
[363:55.69]That should be cool.
[364:00.76]I'm just doing what the actor wanted me to do.
[364:10.02]What would happen if Pippin was in Path of the Dead?
[364:13.12]Malice.
[364:26.38]There's really no change here.
[364:30.46]From behind, there's no change.
[364:33.10]There's not a big difference here.
[364:34.26]It's just another small guy.
[364:40.54]I wonder what would happen if Pippin were to be here.
[364:51.16]The spirits of the dead.
[365:11.65]Pretty good, actually.
[365:12.75]Pretty good, Pippin.
[365:17.19]Not bad, actually.
[365:21.31]Pippin's pretty good.
[365:25.94]then no voice lines yet this should be more specters see can pippin throw big things oh he's pretty good that's not pippin yes it is
[365:58.20]Hello?
[366:04.80]Alright, it takes more than like three hits to die as level one.
[366:09.07]Am I actually going to play through this level right now?
[366:24.58]Does he have any lines?
[366:25.48]He has to.
[366:26.81]When Gimli talks, he's going to say something.
[366:38.85]Hey, it's mostly I'm currently reading the Lord of the Rings books.
[366:45.69]Are you really?
[366:48.09]Nice.
[366:51.55]Tharif is spoiling the whole series.
[367:03.09]Imagine coming to the stream and you're getting ready to read all the books and spend weeks or months reading all of them.
[367:10.78]And just watch what just happened with all of them.
[367:13.06]I'm not gonna talk.
[367:20.34]Months?
[367:20.68]Yeah, months.
[367:22.20]It could take a long time to read a book.
[367:26.50]Especially the Lord of the Rings.
[367:27.32]The Lord of the Rings are huge.
[367:30.13]You read like a chapter a night?
[367:31.33]Two chapters a night?
[367:32.32]For all the books?
[367:33.10]It'd probably take you... It'd probably take you fucking... At least a few weeks.
[367:58.89]Everybody stops fighting when I'm not here.
[368:03.73]Oh man, I've read the books.
[368:05.59]I've just started Game of Thrones.
[368:06.90]I love it.
[368:16.70]Should we tell him?
[368:19.00]Should we tell him that the next two books are literally just never going to come out?
[368:22.56]Should we tell him?
[368:25.86]I've been waiting almost ten years for that fifth book.
[368:29.88]Just want to make sure you understand that book's probably never releasing.
[368:37.60]I finished that- I finished, uh, Dance of Dragons in, like, 2011.
[368:41.41]And it was like, yeah, here we go, I'm gonna, uh, Winds of Winter is coming out in, like, a year!
[368:47.29]It's been almost ten fucking years.
[368:50.15]That book's never coming out.
[368:53.92]Just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[368:55.18]If you're gonna get into, like, the Games for Owns books,
[369:00.46]You're going to be with the rest of us real soon.
[369:11.87]And don't leave it to HBO.
[369:13.87]Like, oh, well, whatever.
[369:14.75]I'll just watch HBO.
[369:15.63]No, don't do that.
[369:18.59]Be careful there.
[369:19.05]We are trapped here.
[369:24.22]We must find a way to go quickly.
[369:32.81]It's not TV.
[369:33.77]It's HBO.
[369:35.93]That's true.
[369:37.29]Pippin's pretty good.
[369:55.90]Yeah, it became so... I don't really want to talk about Game of Thrones or anything.
[370:00.82]Because I don't... I obviously don't want people that haven't seen it or they're planning on getting interested or... Yeah, I don't want to be talking about like, well, let me tell you about this part and this part.
[370:08.34]No, we don't have to do that.
[370:11.36]But... I wasn't a big fan.
[370:17.82]I wasn't a big fan.
[370:20.32]Pippin, you alright?
[370:26.87]Pippin, you alright?
[370:27.43]Pippin's dead.
[370:28.67]Okay.
[370:30.15]Now we know what happens.
[370:30.87]Pippin dies if he goes in there.
[370:32.89]Cool.
[370:51.34]Alright, let's get this one.
[370:53.53]Here we go.
[370:54.01]Merry.
[370:54.33]What does Merry have to say to us?
[370:56.60]Thank you.
[370:56.90]What?
[370:57.06]I have... I... What?
[370:57.42]That would be funny.
[371:22.09]because he's very protective and he feels like a father figure to you.
[371:24.87]Maybe you have issues about it.
[371:26.61]You can do anything you want.
[371:27.55]You can go anywhere you want with Merry and Pippin.
[371:30.05]So this is now our treat to you as a gamer.
[371:34.43]I got it.
[371:36.33]Well done.
[371:38.58]I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[371:43.30]In the Shire, you know, Merry looks kind of sweet and approachable.
[371:51.02]That's more accurate, right?
[371:54.44]No, that's dead.
[371:55.32]Like, oh, I want a sandwich.
[371:56.99]I want to have some... No?
[371:57.93]What are you talking about?
[371:58.93]That's more accurate than gone.
[372:13.41]But he's wily and has a bit of guile and intelligence.
[372:18.41]Probably one of the greatest computer-generated characters of all time.
[372:20.51]What about Second Breakfast?
[372:21.61]Yeah, they like comic relief.
[372:28.55]They're R2 and C-3PO.
[372:39.46]I don't think that's accurate either.
[372:46.66]Well, I think we saw everything.
[372:47.63]Wait, nope!
[372:49.39]We have one more interview with Faramir.
[372:53.11]Faramir, Prince of Gondor, was one of the few men who withstood the power of the Ring.
[373:00.32]But Faramir and Boromir were brothers, and it isn't beyond possibility that Faramir went to Rivendell instead.
[373:07.59]And if that happened, Faramir could have survived and returned to Gondor.
[373:11.49]You decide.
[373:12.59]Now we're going to explore this fact by unlocking the character of Faramir.
[373:17.71]See for yourself what else you might have done during the war at the ring.
[373:22.73]Good luck.
[373:25.14]I mean, it's cool, but it's just... You can just take the character and you can't... I don't know.
[373:32.60]It's cool.
[373:33.56]I'll do it this time.
[373:36.57]Gameplayers should unlock Faramir first because he's a character who is in possession of multi skills.
[373:43.60]He's a great swordsman They actually get any different abilities or nothing I
[373:52.85]Yes.
[373:53.85]Baromir's style of combat in the game, extremely energetic.
[373:57.52]It's relentless.
[373:58.34]It's high-energy, high-voltage action.
[374:01.90]The game itself has totally captured the excitement in all aspects of the film, Return of the King, and I don't think you can ask more than that.
[374:13.12]High-voltage gameplay, guys.
[374:14.56]It's pretty good.
[374:17.18]Alright.
[374:18.00]That's it.
[374:23.06]Does the tree do anything?
[374:23.82]No.
[374:26.72]I didn't miss anything down here, did I?
[374:30.86]We saw all the interviews.
[374:33.01]All the production stills.
[374:33.95]Pleasure Wood.
[374:35.35]On Aston.
[374:38.29]Game concept art.
[374:41.89]Film concept art.
[374:43.41]Hobbits on gaming.
[374:47.58]This, I'm glad we didn't miss this one.
[374:52.39]Well, Elijah's a pretty good gamer.
[374:54.17]The best player would be Elijah.
[374:56.81]Well, this is where I get to pat myself on the back.
[375:00.84]I'm definitely a better gamer than the two of them.
[375:04.02]Yes!
[375:04.88]Elijah has this insane ability of being able to just grab hold of a console and go through a game.
[375:12.83]He's not even making that up.
[375:13.91]That's probably real.
[375:14.87]I wouldn't be surprised if Elijah Wood could do that.
[375:17.61]He can do everything else.
[375:19.18]He can fucking sing, he can dance, he can act, he can cook.
[375:37.66]I'm on fire now.
[375:38.36]He can lift big, heavy fucking weights and shit.
[375:40.64]I said, OK, give us a... Beat him three times in a row.
[375:43.94]Billy's getting better, but he's not great.
[375:46.22]Billy is awful.
[375:48.66]One of the worst game players of all time.
[375:51.20]I think I do have a special gift for gaming.
[375:54.63]You'll be playing a two-player game and you'll go, Billy, press X, and he'll be like, hang on a minute, which one's X?
[376:00.73]But I just haven't really opened that gift yet and given it to myself.
[376:04.93]LAUGHTER
[376:14.24]That was funny.
[376:19.34]Wait, hold on.
[376:21.32]No, I got that one.
[376:22.22]No, I got them all.
[376:24.06]No, I got them all.
[376:27.40]Alright, guys.
[376:27.88]I'm going to call it here.
[376:31.94]No Vigo interview?
[376:32.96]Yeah, what's going on there?
[376:33.78]I guess they got him for the last one.
[376:35.72]They got Vigo.
[376:36.42]They got John.
[376:39.20]Did they get Orlando Bloom for the last one, too?
[376:41.52]They were in the last one.
[376:43.68]Maybe the claw grip?
[376:55.17]Did you give Kim the ten gifted fries yet?
[376:58.19]No, we actually haven't gone to any restaurant that would even have them.
[377:03.90]We just haven't.
[377:04.96]We just haven't been there.
[377:05.76]Got a wink?
[377:07.46]Sure.
[377:07.64]Sure.
[377:13.80]Last star is hardcore mode.
[377:15.10]Well, you have to probably beat the game on hard.
[377:17.66]But yeah, that's a good place to stop it.
[377:19.40]We are now done with the Lord of the Rings for now.
[377:22.40]That was good.
[377:23.64]Shorter than the last one.
[377:24.52]I thought we were going to be playing this for a little bit longer, but it's a good place to stop.
[377:29.57]So again, tomorrow, tomorrow I got some shit I got to do.
[377:32.75]I got physical therapy to do.
[377:34.35]But I'll be here after it.
[377:36.47]And what game am I going to play tomorrow?
[377:38.45]What are we going to start tomorrow?
[377:39.53]Well, wouldn't you love to know?
[377:41.91]That's a secret only I know.
[377:46.09]I think you're going to like it.
[377:50.99]Nancy Drew?
[377:51.77]No.
[377:54.57]No, no Lord of the Rings.
[377:56.93]We did all three of the books.
[377:59.48]Well, let's be honest.
[378:01.16]I read the first ten chapters of the first one.
[378:05.80]And then we read the second and third book.
[378:07.06]So that's fine.
[378:13.42]Not all the books.
[378:14.22]Oh yeah, there's the... There's the... There's the... There's the Similarian, right?
[378:19.72]Am I saying that right?
[378:21.79]Is that the Sim's currency, or is that the name of the book?
[378:30.87]Sima... Sima... Simarillion.
[378:35.80]Hold on.
[378:36.34]The Simarillion's the name of the book, and the Similarian... What's the Sim currency?
[378:42.45]What's your... Hold on.
[378:43.19]What's The Sims currency called?
[378:49.52]Sim... Simoleons.
[378:51.14]Oh, it's Simoleons.
[378:53.32]Not Simarillions.
[379:00.16]Alright.
[379:00.96]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[379:02.06]You'll see what we play.
[379:02.72]We're going to start again.
[379:03.62]We're starting late tomorrow because of this.
[379:05.16]We're starting at about 6pm Pacific.
[379:08.03]Thanks for joining me.
[379:08.63]I had a lot of fun.
[379:11.61]It's good to play these old games, and... I didn't... Not even a meltdown tonight.
[379:15.88]Somebody might be disappointed.
[379:16.92]Fuck, I thought he was gonna, like, bite his controller tonight.
[379:18.86]Nope, not tonight.
[379:22.10]But we'll do the, uh, bits and everything.
[379:24.34]And go from there.
[379:25.38]If you take it off, we'll see you tomorrow.
[379:28.40]Good to be back.
[379:30.22]See you soon.
[379:36.20]It's the only time I get to use this music.
[379:38.94]In, like, an outro.
[379:42.02]It works pretty perfectly, actually.
[379:46.12]Alright, I said I got to clean my room too.
[379:48.41]This is kind of getting ridiculous.
[379:54.49]Is that music going?
[379:55.31]Is that music going?
[380:00.35]Can you hear that music?
[380:04.79]Is that music going?
[380:13.29]There we go.
[380:13.99]Okay.
[380:17.93]Let me just change over here so I can actually see what you guys are saying.
[380:22.83]Uh-huh.
[380:25.59]Alright, let's go back to six and a half hours ago.
[380:33.38]Let's take a look.
[380:39.24]We had $4 from Pugles.
[380:40.19]Thank you, Pugles.
[380:41.31]Anyway, glad you're back.
[380:42.21]P.S.
[380:42.27]I'm gonna be getting the fireman plushie.
[380:44.03]The end of that question, I have no idea.
[381:03.94]But I think everybody thinks they're going to get along with Elijah Wood.
[381:07.87]He seems very nice.
[381:08.79]He seems very approachable.
[381:09.87]He seems very down to Earth.
[381:13.33]I feel like anybody could probably get along with Elijah Wood.
[381:16.97]He's got that energy to him.
[381:18.87]I agree.
[381:19.15]I agree.
[381:27.90]When is his game coming?
[381:28.88]Does he have a game coming up?
[381:29.60]Elijah Wood has a game coming up.
[381:34.91]What is it?
[381:38.72]Really?
[381:39.48]What is it?
[381:41.56]Elijah Wood game.
[381:46.16]Elijah Wood video game.
[381:50.58]Transference is the name of the game.
[381:56.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[381:57.83]Really?
[381:58.15]Is Elijah Wood making an FMV game?
[382:09.44]Oh, no, it's VR.
[382:12.40]It's like a VR FMV game?
[382:16.14]Or maybe not FMV.
[382:17.14]That's interesting.
[382:20.09]Hmm.
[382:25.55]This is back in 2018 is when they were talking about this.
[382:28.39]That's cool.
[382:29.69]That'd be insane, actually.
[382:30.81]I'm into it.
[382:33.41]Whenever it's ready, I'll take a look.
[382:37.87]No, that's cool.
[382:39.29]I did not know that he was doing that.
[382:41.71]I look forward to seeing it.
[382:43.21]Now, what is FMV?
[382:44.25]Oh, it's already... Wait, it's out now?
[382:45.61]Wait, it's already out?
[382:50.89]It came out in 2018.
[382:51.55]What?
[382:51.65]Is it on Steam?
[383:01.47]Huh.
[383:01.73]It's apparently okay.
[383:02.85]It's got... It's got mostly positive reviews.
[383:04.27]It's got some negative reviews, though.
[383:27.72]Apparently, the people are upset about Ubisoft doing the... Let's see, let's see.
[383:37.07]It's apparently got some issues.
[383:42.43]Got some issues.
[383:47.78]One of these reviews says, don't buy this game if you don't have a VR.
[383:53.26]So what, the non-VR version is not very good?
[383:55.70]Hmm.
[383:58.06]Well, we'll keep that in mind.
[384:02.10]Is that... Ubisoft.
[384:07.22]Alright, let's keep going.
[384:08.00]Espada Escalada, thanks for 250.
[384:09.51]Hey, Jerma.
[384:10.71]Jav Gaming here.
[384:11.71]We're glad you enjoyed our videos enough to take a week off to enjoy them.
[384:15.27]More codes are on the way.
[384:18.45]What's Jav?
[384:19.90]What is Jav Gaming?
[384:23.18]What the hell is that?
[384:27.33]BluePunda, thanks for 300 bits.
[384:28.91]I used to play this so much.
[384:29.85]I love the nostalgia.
[384:30.75]Me too.
[384:32.01]Me too.
[384:34.49]PotionDweller, thanks for $3.
[384:36.17]Hey, Jerma, you've been gone for too long.
[384:37.49]This week was painfully slow.
[384:39.54]Glad to have you back.
[384:42.02]Yeah, February is going to be a little messed up.
[384:44.84]This is one of the busiest months in a while.
[384:49.98]I've got physical therapy going, which I have to go to and I have to stick to.
[384:54.42]I don't know how many times a week this will be going.
[384:58.25]I will assume I have to probably do physical therapy maybe once or twice a week.
[385:05.05]Whenever I have to do it, I'm going to do it.
[385:06.93]So I'm going to have to bounce streams around and try to get them in and do this too.
[385:15.22]Why are you doing physical therapy?
[385:16.48]Because I have costochondritis.
[385:22.02]And I know I don't want to gross anybody out here, but... If I lean back and stretch my ribcage a little and sort of tilt and move my chest, it goes... And it kind of hurts.
[385:37.41]But then it feels okay for a little bit.
[385:40.68]It's just kind of popping.
[385:41.94]Weird.
[385:44.78]It's pretty crunchy down there.
[385:46.36]So... Caustic Andritis is inflammation in your ribcage.
[385:51.74]I just I was told it would make sense because I have the colitis problems are autoimmune and I was told that you know it's not out of the ordinary that for somebody that has IBD which is autoimmune which is I've had it for years
[386:11.00]that something like this could pop up too randomly because your body my body's just stupid and for some reason wants to attack itself because I'm my body's dumb and I got low IQ fucking DNA I don't understand I have now this is like two potential autoimmune diseases which like what the fuck
[386:42.61]But going on physical therapy, I've been told, helps a lot.
[386:46.69]And in some cases can make the problem almost completely go away.
[386:50.73]We'll see.
[386:50.97]I'm going to give it a shot.
[386:56.03]LM man, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[386:57.57]Jerma, choo-choo, you deserve a chew.
[386:59.37]Is that a Space Channel 5 reference?
[387:03.33]Sounds like it.
[387:06.73]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[387:09.38]Ibuprofen is good for inflammation.
[387:12.17]Yeah, I'm going to give you some of my personal thoughts and personal beliefs here on this subject.
[387:22.97]I don't want, I don't like, here we go.
[387:28.99]I can go get an injection tomorrow into my nerve of steroids and nerve blocker, and I might be fine.
[387:38.58]But I don't really like the idea of doing that first, and I don't like the idea of taking ibuprofen every day.
[387:45.62]Taking ibuprofen or Tylenol every day, it's really not great for you.
[387:51.17]And I don't want to get into the habit of taking three or four ibuprofen a day and saying, man, I feel fucking great.
[387:59.55]I'm just going to take four ibuprofen every day.
[388:03.13]And then I'm essentially masking a problem that could be fixed, maybe potentially if I just did it.
[388:09.47]And I don't really want to just use painkillers to just put a blanket over a potential actual joint problem that I have that I could just fix.
[388:20.54]It's the same reason why I really don't
[388:29.83]want to go on any like prescription pain medicine.
[388:34.07]I know that that's been floated around before of, oh, you have like osteochondritis or you have like joint problems, you have a joint disease.
[388:41.70]Well, you're going to take Vicodin, you know, just a small dose every day.
[388:45.32]No, no, I'm not going to do that.
[388:47.60]I'm not going to take one.
[388:50.84]I don't want to even do that.
[388:55.64]And that's what I've told the doctor, and the doctor also said, that's a good idea, just, we'll see what happens with physical therapy, let's see what happens.
[389:07.91]Now, in the event that physical therapy does not work, you know, let's say I do physical therapy for the next four to six months, and there is no progress.
[389:22.49]And if it get worse, it could get worse.
[389:24.21]I don't know.
[389:25.17]At that point, it's like, okay, I've done physical therapy for six months.
[389:30.34]Let's do the injection and see what happens.
[389:36.30]That's the plan now.
[389:38.46]It could take a couple of years.
[389:42.47]Yeah.
[389:44.37]But there's another layer here.
[389:48.55]Okay, here's the other layer.
[389:51.48]I, you know, I got stuff to do every day, you know?
[389:55.97]It's not just the stream.
[389:57.67]I want to be, like, on this stream and not have to even think about it.
[390:00.11]I want to be able to interact and have fun and do whatever I want to do and have it in the back of your mind that, like, oh, my, like, whole fucking ribcage hurts.
[390:09.27]It's, you know, I don't want to, three, four years from now, like, it would get really fucking annoying and it would just sit in the back of my head.
[390:17.69]Always.
[390:18.94]Always.
[390:21.68]So, I mean, I'm eventually here over the next 6 to 12.
[390:24.66]I've got to have a real solution for this.
[390:27.50]I don't want this to turn into an issue that's... I'm just sitting here and my... Hey, guys, I'm going to go to the grocery store today.
[390:34.32]Oh, my fucking chest hurts.
[390:41.57]But it's not an issue that's life-threatening or that would really, really debilitate me.
[390:50.06]It's just annoying.
[390:54.52]My ribcage sucks.
[390:56.30]That's pretty much it.
[390:57.60]And... But I just really... I also have to live my life, too.
[391:02.00]I'm not gonna... I'm not taking any pain medicine.
[391:04.80]I'm not doing any treatments.
[391:06.39]I'm just gonna be in pain here every day.
[391:08.43]And I'm... Eventually, I'm gonna have to do something.
[391:11.79]If something like physical therapy doesn't work.
[391:17.81]But that road is very, very, very far in the future.
[391:23.38]Don't forget to do the stuff that physical therapist tells you to do at home.
[391:26.40]I'm going to be... I'm going to follow 100% of the instructions.
[391:32.58]No matter what they are.
[391:34.75]This physical therapist could tell me, you have to eat lettuce every day for the next year.
[391:39.05]I'm going to turn fucking green.
[391:44.51]I'm going to turn fucking green.
[391:48.24]You know what I mean?
[391:54.32]You don't do that already?
[391:55.38]I mean, I eat lettuce.
[391:56.58]I like lettuce.
[391:57.64]I like romaine lettuce.
[391:58.78]Is romaine lettuce okay to eat?
[392:00.56]No.
[392:03.04]Didn't they recall every single romaine lettuce ever?
[392:08.89]Is this still going on?
[392:14.17]January 15th, 2020.
[392:15.88]Outbreak of E. coli infections.
[392:17.34]Romaine lettuce.
[392:18.04]Is this still going on?
[392:23.01]This is like three weeks ago.
[392:23.97]I ate romaine like ten... It just keeps happening.
[392:34.68]Alright, well, instead of romaine, I'll just... I don't know.
[392:37.38]I'll eat... We'll do spinach.
[392:38.92]Spinach is fucking better anyways.
[392:41.77]Thank you.
[392:42.09]Appreciate it.
[392:50.63]Kale?
[392:51.27]Actually, I don't like kale.
[392:52.69]I'm not a kale guy.
[392:54.83]You put spinach and kale next to each other, I'm going to eat the spinach every time.
[392:58.31]Every single time.
[393:02.43]I don't like the consistency of kale.
[393:04.66]I don't... It's like... It's like stringy almost.
[393:09.98]It takes long to eat it.
[393:11.26]It's like tough for me.
[393:12.66]No.
[393:14.62]Spinach.
[393:23.40]Marv Ashmagali, thanks for the 250.
[393:24.64]It's so good seeing you play one of my childhood games on stream.
[393:27.84]I completed this game when I was 12.
[393:29.26]You better finish this.
[393:29.98]We got this in the very beginning.
[393:31.02]I stopped the stream for it.
[393:33.18]You have no excuses.
[393:35.24]Okay, here we go.
[393:36.87]Here's a prediction of your meltdown.
[393:38.15]Let's see if these were accurate.
[393:39.93]Prediction of your meltdowns.
[393:41.97]Getting trampled by an Entus Gandalf.
[393:45.73]Okay, that was, um... No, that did happen a couple times.
[393:50.75]Trying to destroy Isengard's dam.
[393:55.73]No, that's one for two here.
[393:59.23]I was just confused.
[394:01.51]Trying to kill the king of the dead.
[394:05.07]No, I didn't have that much of a problem with the king of the dead.
[394:08.51]One for three.
[394:09.80]Trying to escape after killing the king of the dead.
[394:12.00]Okay, yes.
[394:14.64]That counts.
[394:15.80]I was not happy on that one.
[394:18.40]The Oliphant level.
[394:19.92]Yep.
[394:20.72]All the Minas Tirith levels.
[394:24.26]And the final levels of the Gates of Mordor.
[394:26.62]Or at least these are the levels that got me mad.
[394:32.44]Four for four?
[394:34.34]Yeah, don't buy the other one, right?
[394:37.32]The four for four?
[394:38.11]The four dollar box, whatever it is?
[394:41.18]I haven't eaten Wendy's in a long time.
[394:43.36]I'm being serious.
[394:44.82]Eddie the Penguin, thanks for the five community subs in actually ten.
[394:48.06]Eddie the Penguin gave it twice.
[394:49.08]Thanks, Eddie.
[394:51.88]Alec the Bunny.
[394:52.46]We had Eddie the Penguin and Alec the Bunny right next to each other.
[394:58.36]Thanks for the five dollars, Alec.
[395:00.08]Jerem, I've been watching your stuff for a few years and you've always entertained and cheered me up during bad days.
[395:08.17]Happy to hear that you enjoy being here.
[395:11.95]Hope those bad days turn into good days.
[395:14.01]I hope you have more good days than bad days.
[395:16.92]It's the best you can do.
[395:19.20]Thank you for the $5.
[395:23.30]A plushie bat.
[395:24.20]Thanks for the $5.
[395:27.12]My name is Jerma.
[395:29.15]Peed my pants.
[395:30.03]They called me Jerma.
[395:31.55]Peed my pants because I'm Jerma and I've in fact peed my pants.
[395:35.51]A bunch of PogChamps.
[395:47.73]sick alright thank you corn on the rob for the five dollars 500 bits from corn on the rub
[395:53.84]Jerma Today that marks the fourth straight year I've subbed to you.
[395:57.80]I've been watching you since 2013.
[396:00.40]I was in high school when I started watching you and now I have a bachelor's degree.
[396:04.14]Hell yeah.
[396:05.52]You might remember me as the kid that caught you off guard for a selfie outside PAX East 2014.
[396:12.53]You and Star signed my scout poster.
[396:15.07]I still have it framed.
[396:15.99]I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for entertaining me for seven years.
[396:22.97]Yeah.
[396:24.03]I'm happy you still think this is fun to be around.
[396:27.51]This much time later.
[396:34.78]Did I just fart?
[396:36.84]No.
[396:38.80]I did not.
[396:40.70]What you probably just heard was Otto.
[396:44.58]Otto is back here.
[396:46.16]And he's just simply hanging out, being a good dog, and having some fun.
[396:51.99]He's lying around.
[396:55.95]Just hanging out.
[397:00.12]Watch out, watch out.
[397:02.10]Do you want to get out of here?
[397:02.90]He's like, get me out of here.
[397:04.68]He's like, get me out of here.
[397:06.43]I'll get you out in a second.
[397:07.91]Just hold on.
[397:09.45]I'll get you out.
[397:10.21]He wants to go.
[397:11.13]Give me one second.
[397:11.63]I'm just going to let the dog out.
[398:03.92]What's up?
[398:07.60]Okay.
[398:08.42]Uh, let's keep going.
[398:10.48]Otto wanted to get out of the room.
[398:11.52]He was like, I'm out.
[398:15.17]Uh, Tar Alacrin, thanks for the 251 bits.
[398:16.55]Thanks for the 250.
[398:19.90]Grandma, how have you not used up your bottle of cologne in 20 years?
[398:23.98]You do realize that you need to spray it on you for it to make you smell nice, right?
[398:29.14]Um, because I don't use very much.
[398:31.16]Because I don't want to be the person that walks into a room and everybody tries to find the smell.
[398:38.81]Because you spray yourself more- you give yourself more than one or two spritzes of cologne, you turn into the person that then just drops smell in every room they go in.
[398:51.08]And then everyone has- everyone goes, Who's- does somebody have cologne on?
[398:54.84]Who's- who is that?
[398:56.26]Who's- Oh, it might be me.
[398:59.02]Yeah, yeah, that's you.
[399:00.10]Well, I like that, but- oh, yeah, that's you.
[399:03.26]By the way, I was in the kitchen and you were in the living room when I asked this question.
[399:09.68]So I like to just do a little, you do a little bit, you just like a tiny, like just a, that's it right under the neck.
[399:16.47]I lift my chin up, like I lift my chin up, right under the neck down.
[399:22.37]Or if you have, uh, the one that's not a spray, you just take one little dip on your finger and right under the, under the jaw, like, like that's it.
[399:31.89]You're done.
[399:34.61]You don't need very much.
[399:37.90]How many sprays?
[399:38.64]Let's see.
[399:40.06]Uh, how many sprays are in a bottle of cologne?
[399:48.46]735 sprays in a 50ml bottle.
[399:55.01]So, I don't wear cologne every day.
[400:03.76]If I spray that once, even once a week or once every two weeks when I go out or something, that's fucking 10 to 20 years worth of cologne.
[400:22.31]You don't need to use very much.
[400:24.57]And sometimes, and if you, and by the way, no, that is accurate.
[400:27.87]That's very accurate because no, you don't have one bottle of cologne.
[400:32.56]I have, like, ten different bottles of cologne.
[400:35.43]You use one for, like, a couple days.
[400:38.35]Week goes by, use the next one.
[400:39.81]Two weeks go by, use the next one.
[400:41.03]You're always recycling colognes.
[400:45.79]You don't do the same scent, you do a bunch.
[400:49.06]You do, like, at least four or five of them to change it up.
[400:56.77]Who wears cologne?
[400:58.13]I don't.
[400:59.56]This is my point.
[401:00.38]My point is I wear cologne maybe once every like three to four weeks.
[401:04.92]And I spray one time.
[401:06.60]So yes, if I spray one spray a month, that's 735 months.
[401:12.37]What's the math there?
[401:13.11]735 divided by 12.
[401:14.63]Let's see.
[401:25.05]Okay, so I have 61 years worth of cologne.
[401:27.95]That's not right.
[401:28.63]What?
[401:30.25]That's 60... Yeah, it is right.
[401:32.27]Okay, I have 60 fucking years worth of cologne.
[401:35.61]It's... I don't... That's not hard to understand.
[401:42.89]You gotta pass it down.
[401:43.71]It's like whiskey.
[401:45.81]You don't drink a bottle of nice whiskey all in the same weekend.
[401:48.70]I mean, some of you guys might, but fucking be careful, for God's sakes.
[402:01.14]Anyways, where were we?
[402:04.39]Oh, right, we were at JermaSucks for five community subs.
[402:06.57]Thanks a lot.
[402:09.17]Uh, AncientSasquatch, thanks for 250.
[402:10.91]Jerma, thanks for the stream.
[402:11.65]Any chance we could have a few details about the charity rumble?
[402:14.83]Uh, like if there's any special you want to do for it.
[402:17.57]Or even an ETA.
[402:19.90]Uh, there is no ETA on it, but it's going to happen at some point before April.
[402:25.65]Because the marathon is in April.
[402:28.31]So we would need to do it before then.
[402:30.13]So it's going to happen before April.
[402:39.33]Isn't that an ETA?
[402:40.43]Yeah, I guess it is.
[402:41.55]Estimated time.
[402:42.31]Yeah, before April.
[402:43.51]That's not really a time.
[402:45.63]That's more of a estimated time to end it.
[402:51.05]You know what I mean?
[402:51.69]That's like... It could be tomorrow or it could be March 31st.
[402:55.77]That's a huge time frame.
[402:56.79]Yeah.
[402:59.07]That's not like an ETA.
[403:00.05]That's a big, giant time frame.
[403:06.56]Call it what you will.
[403:10.66]For real, though, thanks for the $2.50.
[403:12.54]I don't know if you're aware, but the Vermintide devs made a Rats reference.
[403:16.62]I actually did see this.
[403:20.12]I did see the rats.
[403:21.14]Rats, where are the rats?
[403:23.26]On the Vermintide 2.
[403:26.08]Patch notes or something, right?
[403:27.41]Whatever it was.
[403:29.57]News, yeah.
[403:32.01]There you go.
[403:36.67]Yeah, there is no... It's just the title of their dev update is just rats, rats, where are the rats?
[403:44.70]They don't go into... And by the way, oh my god, Jervis is so great.
[403:47.30]It's just the one line.
[403:50.22]Actually, from... I was reading a few threads about this, and apparently the rats... That rats movie and the rat clip.
[403:59.84]There's a clip going around that people know what it is, but people might not know that it's from this channel.
[404:06.16]From my understanding, the rats have turned into their own thing.
[404:09.66]That aren't even connected to me anymore.
[404:11.20]It's just a thing.
[404:15.52]And... Whatever.
[404:17.18]It's, you know...
[404:20.05]The student becomes the master, as they say.
[404:22.17]It's just going.
[404:22.73]The rats don't need you.
[404:23.51]No, they don't need me anymore.
[404:24.69]They're going off to college.
[404:26.89]They're going to be their own rats.
[404:36.22]They've entered meme-hood.
[404:38.91]Yeah, that's fine.
[404:39.45]Whatever.
[404:40.19]People can enjoy it.
[404:41.09]That's why I did it.
[404:41.89]That's why I said it in the first place.
[404:43.05]That's why I made the video.
[404:45.31]So people could fucking think it was fun and use it and care about it and think it was funny.
[404:48.79]That was it.
[404:49.37]So, good.
[404:51.65]Makes me happy.
[404:55.91]Sue them.
[404:57.61]Cease and desist.
[404:59.89]So, you'd like me to cease and desist on the rats, which is from a video game that I do not own the rights to.
[405:09.54]Characters that were created for 3D Movie Maker that I don't own the property rights for.
[405:14.79]So I'm going to, on behalf of me and Microsoft... I don't have the... I don't have the authority to do anything about that.
[405:35.82]Anthony Banthony's on the case.
[405:40.09]um no it's fine it doesn't bother me if people sing the rat song what am I gonna trademark happy birthday you know what am I I heard I heard somebody said the rat song um excuse me I I said that but isn't that person and what am I what am I supposed to do
[406:01.35]It's not like the Vermintide devs made money off of saying, rats, rats were the rats.
[406:08.51]They're not selling that in the store.
[406:12.18]Alright, if the Vermintide 2 devs made a downloadable music track that they made in House of the Rat song, and they sold it for like $5.
[406:21.28]There you go.
[406:21.90]There's your opportunity.
[406:32.48]At that point, I would get on the phone and be like, hey.
[406:36.95]What do I do about this?
[406:37.77]No.
[406:41.71]That's fair use.
[406:43.73]That's just, that's fair use.
[406:45.51]Yeah, I'm saying if they uploaded my voice.
[406:52.76]If they just put up the rat song and had to buy it.
[406:55.02]This is like a completely unbelievable fucking not even real scenario.
[407:04.42]I don't own any fucking copyrights.
[407:06.74]I wouldn't be able to do anything.
[407:19.38]He's getting upset over hypothetical lawsuits.
[407:26.39]Copyright.
[407:27.23]I can't copyright the rats.
[407:31.15]I can't do that.
[407:32.31]That's not going to happen.
[407:40.77]Making money off of your intellectual property.
[407:43.88]You have intellectual ownership.
[407:53.89]If they used your voice, there would be a case.
[407:56.35]There's no case.
[407:57.65]There's no cases.
[407:58.45]There's no case.
[407:59.51]There's no case.
[408:01.59]No, this is not even real.
[408:03.66]Alright, we're gonna move on.
[408:08.27]Like, dude, I think you should really, like, forget it and get a lawyer at this point.
[408:11.46]Like, dude, this is a case here.
[408:17.48]No, it's really cool, though.
[408:19.64]A huge, like, eight-minute pretend hypothetical fucking lawsuit later.
[408:25.08]That's really cool.
[408:25.76]I'm glad that people think it's a cool meme, and they think it's fun, and I'm glad it's grown up and moved on to meme college.
[408:32.87]Uh, Captain Nemo, thanks for the 500 bits.
[408:34.55]Jerma, did you ever hear the story about how Christopher Lee was an assassin?
[408:49.12]Christopher Lee corrects Peter Jackson.
[408:53.00]Wait, what is this?
[408:53.56]Oh, I gotta plug this in.
[409:08.28]Let me hear this.
[409:16.24]You ought to see me with the .357 Magnum.
[409:19.99]I'm asking when worm tongue rises up and comes up behind Simon to stab him of course it was my job as director to talk to Christopher lee and to explain to him what I what I wanted so I started to go into this long explanation about what sort of sound he should make when he got stabbed I seem to recall that I did say to Peter have you any idea of what kind of noise happens when somebody's stabbed in the back and I said because I do
[409:50.20]What the fuck?
[409:51.04]Holy shit.
[409:53.71]It's because the breath's driven out of your body.
[409:58.75]He proceeded to sort of talk about some very clandestine part of World War II.
[410:03.61]He used to be in the British Secret Service, whatever they were called.
[410:06.50]Holy shit, really?
[410:07.44]He seemed to have expert knowledge of exactly the sort of noise that they make, and so I just sort of didn't push the subject any further.
[410:14.64]I just said, well, you obviously know what to do, Christopher, so I'm sure you'll do it great, and he did.
[410:19.21]Ah!
[410:23.56]That's fucking wild.
[410:25.02]Holy shit.
[410:38.13]I didn't know that.
[410:38.77]That's fucking awesome.
[410:41.21]Don't fuck with Christopher Lee.
[410:42.67]Hold on.
[410:43.15]Otto wants to come back in.
[410:45.59]He's like, let me out.
[410:46.85]Let me in.
[410:47.71]Let me out.
[410:48.53]Let me in.
[410:49.21]Look at me.
[410:51.23]Hold on.
[410:51.45]Let me go get him.
[410:54.74]Hold on, give me one second.
[410:55.95]Auto!
[411:26.56]He's like, yeah, that's what I wanted.
[411:30.05]I love saying his name.
[411:30.97]He's got a great name.
[411:32.69]Otto?
[411:35.37]Show Otto?
[411:36.31]Alright, before the stream turns off, I'll show Otto.
[411:38.59]I've got like another 20 minutes.
[411:41.67]Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[411:43.11]Jedi Fallen Order is pretty good.
[411:45.33]As a Souls aficionado myself, I think it's good.
[411:49.41]Oh, he wants to line the pillow in here.
[411:51.03]He doesn't want me to pick him up.
[411:55.00]He's doing the thing the dogs do, and they just scratch over and over again the same spot of a pillow.
[412:00.08]Or a bed.
[412:00.44]There he goes.
[412:05.05]Pick up the pillow?
[412:07.43]No.
[412:07.65]You know, imagine if you were lying in bed, and somebody just opened the door, and picked up your fucking bed, and shoved you into a camera.
[412:18.26]You'd be like, what the f- no, I'm just trying to-
[412:29.25]That would rule.
[412:30.03]That would be epic.
[412:31.91]Oh, yeah?
[412:33.43]I don't think so.
[412:35.01]Anyways, it's not as good as Sekiro, but since you actually like Star Wars, you might get more enjoyment out of it than me.
[412:46.12]Maybe I'll play it.
[412:48.06]I don't know.
[412:48.52]It's been so long since we've played a new AAA game.
[412:53.77]Outer Wilds is the last game that was a new game.
[412:58.40]It's been so long since we played a new video game.
[413:05.48]It's so slow, though.
[413:07.02]I don't know.
[413:13.69]I gotta play it off-stream, though.
[413:15.01]I love Star Wars.
[413:16.11]I love lightsabers.
[413:19.95]We'll see.
[413:22.07]Steve here, coming at you.
[413:23.39]Thanks for the $2.65.
[413:23.77]Thank you, Steve.
[413:27.18]Uh, Steve is the one that warned us about the, um, $5 Biggie bag from Wendy's.
[413:31.94]Said it wasn't worth it.
[413:33.38]That was Steve coming out, coming at you.
[413:38.50]Thanks.
[413:39.50]Thanks for the tip.
[413:41.70]What am I gonna eat tonight?
[413:43.14]Hmm.
[413:44.48]Eddie the Penguin, thanks for the 500 bits.
[413:46.54]This stream has been DMCA claimed.
[413:50.39]Just playing a video game, man.
[413:51.53]That's all I'm doing.
[413:52.55]Just playing a game.
[413:56.76]No, these games are no joke.
[413:57.36]Don't get yourself wrong there.
[413:58.02]These games are tricky.
[413:58.74]They're hard.
[413:59.04]They're hard to control.
[413:59.66]They're hard to see.
[414:00.86]These are tricky games.
[414:02.36]They're very difficult.
[414:28.37]Hey, can you pause the movie?
[414:30.41]I gotta pee.
[414:32.61]Hope you got back.
[414:33.21]The movie's over.
[414:37.20]Sorry to hear that.
[414:44.31]A group of rowdy Bostonians... This is just a made-up story.
[414:48.33]A group of rowdy Bostonians came into the place I work and demanded Dr. Pepper.
[414:53.25]Even after being informed we don't serve it.
[414:55.63]Later, the oldest member of the group jumped up his table and attempted to do the Mario to impress his friends and ended up throwing out his hip.
[415:02.97]We called an ambulance and had to shut down the strip club for the rest of the night.
[415:07.05]Not a fun day at all.
[415:12.69]Sorry to hear that.
[415:15.26]Sorry to hear that, Bone Jackal.
[415:19.34]Thank you, Juan Ogan.
[415:21.43]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[415:25.33]Juan Hogan, sorry.
[415:27.59]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[415:28.42]Hey, Jerma-certified VOD boy and first-time donator.
[415:32.98]I've been watching your content since middle school and now I'm in college.
[415:35.50]It's so weird to think about that.
[415:36.90]It really is.
[415:38.42]I'm mostly donating to tell you about a weird dream I had about you.
[415:42.14]It wasn't anything too freaky like you having sex on stream.
[415:45.11]But anyway, I was helping a school throw out old textbooks and one of the textbooks was a Jerma985 textbook.
[415:51.69]It had outdated channel memes and a whole chapter dedicated to explaining Twitch chat.
[415:57.50]Also, the textbook was tiny.
[416:01.89]That's an odd book.
[416:02.63]That book would not be very big.
[416:07.57]The Jerma985 textbook.
[416:09.14]What would... Okay, the Jerma985 textbook would be like a 30-page forward from me.
[416:16.16]And then... 8 pages of actual content and 14 full-page ads.
[416:29.54]Thank you, Noka, for the 300 bits.
[416:32.14]Nice to have you back, Jerma.
[416:32.96]Hope your break was good.
[416:35.58]It was good.
[416:36.36]It's good to be back.
[416:38.90]Good to be back.
[416:41.88]Full page, yeah.
[416:42.96]Full page sent ad.
[416:50.88]Remember, there's a whole wiki for you.
[416:55.24]Yeah, I know.
[416:56.94]I've been shown it before.
[417:02.53]With samples?
[417:04.92]Oh yeah, that's right, they do the samples.
[417:07.71]Forgot about that.
[417:10.21]Hey, Mark Meltzer, thanks for the $2.50.
[417:12.01]You mentioned Fallen Order earlier.
[417:13.63]While I haven't played it, I do recommend looking into older Star Wars games.
[417:18.07]Public Commando is an underplayed FPS classic.
[417:20.47]The Jedi Knight series or Force Unleashed both have some good lightsaber stuff in there for you.
[417:25.11]You can never go wrong with playing 2005 Battlefront II.
[417:29.13]Personally, older cult classics make for more fun streams compared to hot AAA titles that are mostly cutscenes.
[417:38.66]Keep on standing out.
[417:42.94]Yeah.
[417:44.72]I mean, I don't really play the old games to necessarily try to do something different.
[417:52.14]I just remember these being crazy and fun and ridiculous.
[417:56.00]I remember playing a lot of these.
[418:00.74]And when we get on a string of, oh yeah, I went and I grabbed 10 PS2 games that I remember playing that I thought were crazy.
[418:10.26]I get to kind of relive it.
[418:12.25]Which is interesting, too, for me.
[418:13.25]It's not that I'm trying to avoid big, new AAA titles.
[418:25.28]It's just... Nothing's come out that's really grabbed my attention and made me want to play it for more than a minute.
[418:34.63]There's been some indie stuff.
[418:36.35]You know, those small...
[418:39.79]not AAA budget games that we've played on this channel over the last year.
[418:47.99]The Phantom Menace game is really bad, but I love it.
[418:53.22]Yeah, I remember some of those.
[418:54.14]I remember Bounty Hunter was pretty fun.
[418:59.50]Outer Wilds is amazing.
[419:02.48]Yeah, but that's not necessarily a AAA experience.
[419:07.53]I don't know.
[419:07.93]If one comes along and I think it's worth playing, I'll do it.
[419:12.05]Or worth streaming is a better way to put that.
[419:16.37]Yeah.
[419:17.45]I agree.
[419:19.03]Atrolox Atrox, thanks for the $2.50.
[419:20.99]Yellow L, this guy thinks he's a Tolkien fan.
[419:24.97]Tolkien fan.
[419:27.51]I haven't seen the movies in a long time.
[419:29.21]It's been a while.
[419:30.67]Awesome Alec, thanks for the $8.00, Awesome Alec.
[419:31.99]Um...
[419:36.49]I don't know what this message is.
[419:37.57]It's... It's... It's just a bunch of clown emotes.
[419:44.03]Is this pornography or something?
[419:47.47]I got a pretty big brain.
[420:09.40]Thank you, Storm.
[420:09.96]Appreciate it.
[420:11.56]Apple Shift, thanks for $2.50.
[420:16.14]Thanks for the 250 bits.
[420:17.66]Hey man, my household's been pretty nightmarish recently.
[420:19.78]It's been non-stop fighting and screaming, basically.
[420:23.21]It sucks, to some degree, but it's escalated a lot these past few months.
[420:27.13]Your streams and videos are my go-to when it comes to drowning it out the best I can.
[420:30.71]Thank you again for being such a comforting voice to turn to.
[420:32.77]You always are, especially now.
[420:35.01]Have a good one, man.
[420:35.66]Hope you had a nice break.
[420:36.54]We missed you.
[420:37.96]I'm sorry to hear that.
[420:42.58]That does not sound like a good time at all.
[420:46.53]I'm not sure how old you are.
[420:50.85]But that does not sound like an environment that you would want to be in.
[420:55.88]I don't know the story here or why or what's going on.
[420:58.90]But stay safe.
[421:05.10]Hopefully you can get out of that scenario and that environment sooner rather than later.
[421:08.62]Thanks for hanging out here, though.
[421:17.18]We absolutely welcome anybody.
[421:19.08]Especially... anyone... that's trying just to get away from something.
[421:27.01]But I will implore you.
[421:31.44]This stream is a good place to hang out.
[421:34.94]But I do want to make it really clear... that...
[421:39.76]If you're having some kind of issue or some kind of problem, I hope you can find the necessary steps to solve it and start to go down the road to fix it.
[421:48.33]Or at least try to.
[421:48.97]Because this stream can only be here to be a stream.
[421:56.77]And I know that does a lot for people.
[421:59.30]But I really hope that you can also take the steps necessary to try to get better or try to fix your scenario.
[422:05.42]Because this stream can only do so much.
[422:14.20]I wish you all the best.
[422:26.19]Stay safe.
[422:29.31]Hopefully you can take care of this scenario.
[422:36.73]We also had a bunch of community subs, right?
[422:39.45]There's been a bunch of community subs.
[422:42.52]10 from Sculpert, 10 from Storm, 5 from Gore, 5 from Great Canadian FK Club.
[422:50.73]Nice stream.
[422:51.23]Loser laughing my ass off.
[422:52.21]I'm going to go get high.
[422:54.23]Eat dust.
[422:58.61]Nice.
[422:59.01]Speaking of Storm, thank you Storm GC for the 500 bits.
[423:05.86]No message, just $5.
[423:06.48]Thank you.
[423:10.47]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[423:11.83]Yo, Jerma, how was your time away?
[423:13.14]I hope all is well.
[423:15.10]While you were away, I streamed and surprisingly, like, over 20 Jermamites came.
[423:19.88]We all had a good time.
[423:20.70]Be careful, Jerma.
[423:21.44]I may steal all your viewers.
[423:22.74]They're mine.
[423:23.22]Nobody can have them.
[423:25.37]Nobody.
[423:25.63]They're all mine.
[423:26.51]No one can have one.
[423:27.79]Not even one.
[423:30.63]Thanks for the 250, though.
[423:31.61]Appreciate it.
[423:42.29]Hey, thank you, Haley.
[423:44.13]Glad to hear it.
[423:49.52]3D compact streamer doesn't like competition.
[423:51.88]Hey, Royal Dawi.
[423:54.58]Royal Dawi, thanks for the thousand bits $10.
[423:58.80]Jerma, whenever you play an older, obscure game that I really liked, you seem to have a bad experience with it.
[424:04.12]All the Lord of the Rings games, Mountain Blade, Warband, Halo Reach.
[424:08.44]I would like to apologize, as I feel I've cursed you to have a bad time with any game that I like.
[424:13.81]What's the matter?
[424:16.59]Oh.
[424:18.81]Ah, Kim's home.
[424:23.07]Now he wants to get out.
[424:24.01]He's like, that's Kim!
[424:24.99]You wanna get out?
[424:28.05]Yeah.
[424:28.17]Yeah.
[424:28.98]Okay.
[424:31.31]Yes.
[424:31.59]Alright.
[424:31.95]Okay.
[424:32.33]I'll let you go.
[424:32.99]Kim just got him.
[424:34.25]Alright.
[424:34.46]Watch out.
[424:34.76]Hold on.
[424:35.22]Right behind you.
[425:00.44]Okay.
[425:02.50]There he goes.
[425:04.72]He's running down to see Mama.
[425:10.55]Let's keep going.
[425:11.57]I would like to apologize.
[425:13.31]I feel like I've cursed you to have a bad time with any game that I like.
[425:16.65]I don't have a bad time with these games.
[425:19.95]A Mountain Blade Warband was... I think it was just overwhelming to me.
[425:25.06]Okay, hold on.
[425:26.44]I've got to rebuttal some of these for you.
[425:28.54]The Lord of the Rings games are just old and very, very difficult just by their nature.
[425:33.76]So I'm going to get frustrated at some points.
[425:35.46]That doesn't mean I don't like the game.
[425:37.56]Mountain Blade Warband overwhelmed me.
[425:41.65]And I believe people in chat were calling me stupid and an idiot and that I smelled and that my stream sucked.
[425:47.61]So that was that one.
[425:48.83]I mean, it just overwhelmed me a little bit.
[425:50.33]Halo Reach was the worst stream of the year last year because me and Joel played it.
[425:56.52]So, I mean, I do not hate these games.
[426:06.28]But, I mean, it's not like I would never... Mountain Blade Warband is just kind of not a game for me.
[426:12.58]It's a lot, it's a kind of lot going on.
[426:14.88]You have to pay attention to a ton of stuff at the same time.
[426:18.37]It's kind of like moving pieces on a big game board.
[426:23.05]You know, that's kind of just not my thing.
[426:29.42]It's really, really interesting, and I do love that people love that series.
[426:35.11]Joel ruined Halo.
[426:41.81]No, it really did.
[426:44.04]Honesty is the best policy.
[426:45.20]Let's use it here.
[426:46.92]I mean, it like ruined all Halo for me.
[426:48.82]Like, all of Halo.
[426:49.68]Not that stream, but just that idea of like, that ruined every Halo game.
[426:53.89]I can't play Halo ever again.
[426:56.91]It has nothing to do with Joe.
[426:59.52]It has nothing to do with Joe.
[427:00.90]He didn't do anything out of the ordinary.
[427:02.70]It's just like, that stream, I just can never play Halo ever again.
[427:08.38]It has nothing to do with Joe.
[427:13.69]God damn it, Joe.
[427:16.75]PS, you should play Warhammer 40k Dawn of War 1.
[427:19.17]That's literally my favorite RTS ever made.
[427:24.93]So you can have another ruined perception of another one of my favorite games.
[427:27.85]Dawn of War 1 is my... The Tau was my favorite.
[427:33.57]That's one of my favorite games.
[427:34.43]That's my favorite RTS ever.
[427:35.74]That's probably the best RTS I've ever played.
[427:37.14]So... How many... Hold on.
[427:46.67]Call me out on this.
[427:48.13]How... Oh, fuck.
[427:49.91]This is why I talk too much.
[427:51.59]I talk too much too often and I say this a lot.
[427:55.12]What is the... How many literally favorite RTSs do I have?
[427:59.72]How many times have I said it?
[428:02.40]We've talked about RTSs and I literally tell you my favorite RTS ever.
[428:06.52]And apparently I've said it like three or four different games.
[428:13.49]Three.
[428:14.95]Happened like three times.
[428:17.62]Just got here.
[428:18.06]Who's Joe?
[428:19.82]You don't know Johnny?
[428:20.54]No, no, Joe.
[428:21.96]Oh.
[428:23.21]Sorry.
[428:23.79]Forgot to put that.
[428:24.59]There was an L there.
[428:26.21]Took me a while to say it.
[428:28.95]But no, I love... I love that game.
[428:31.59]You might see that game eventually.
[428:34.59]Eventually.
[428:35.17]Not anytime soon.
[428:37.83]Thanks a lot for the thousand bits.
[428:40.67]Hey, P Flavor.
[428:42.23]Piff Flavor.
[428:43.41]Hopefully I'm saying that right.
[428:44.45]Thanks for the $5.
[428:45.25]Hey, Jerma, hope you can say my name right this time.
[428:47.47]And hope you have had a good 40 days so far of 2020.
[428:50.61]Here's your Jerma text.
[428:55.28]I hope I got it right.
[428:55.98]I hope I got it right.
[428:57.56]Let's put the... We have a second here.
[429:01.66]Let's do the subs.
[429:02.92]Credits.
[429:04.04]Move away from this one.
[429:05.48]We'll go to that one.
[429:07.35]Theater is now empty.
[429:08.23]Thanks for coming.
[429:08.89]Watch your step on the way out.
[429:13.58]run the credits it's been about a week and a half since we ran the credits thank you all for your support
[429:23.95]Even in my extended absence, a shitload of people still stay subbed to this channel.
[429:31.23]Even though I haven't even streamed.
[429:33.25]So, thanks for that.
[429:35.15]All of you.
[429:36.78]And this is what I'm talking about.
[429:39.04]Come back and hundreds of fucking people sub.
[429:43.18]And thousands of you have stayed subbed.
[429:45.70]Even though I haven't even streamed once in February.
[429:47.84]Until now.
[429:48.56]Essentially.
[429:50.30]Thanks, guys.
[429:58.29]Anyways, let's keep going.
[430:00.46]We still have a little bit more bits to go.
[430:02.14]Maybe like another five or six of them.
[430:05.24]Adara Dufok.
[430:09.60]Adara Dufok.
[430:10.68]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[430:13.32]Ten bucks.
[430:13.68]Appreciate it.
[430:15.37]But.
[430:42.87]Uh, how do you get the garlic and honey?
[430:44.89]Um, it's water too.
[430:46.37]Drink a bunch of water.
[430:49.65]Always be drinking water over the course of the day.
[430:51.59]Try to get, you know, cut out.
[430:55.27]Replace like three or four drinks a day that you drink normally with water.
[430:58.65]It helps.
[431:02.71]Also, stay away from cheese.
[431:05.29]Start cutting cheese out of your life.
[431:06.91]I know that's hard and it's horrible for me to say.
[431:08.85]Yeah.
[431:11.35]Okay, let me go over what just happened there.
[431:14.35]I started to almost choke on the air that I was breathing.
[431:17.97]And I had to make that noise, otherwise I would have choked on air.
[431:22.45]Okay, just stay away from cheese.
[431:24.92]Don't eat that much cheese.
[431:25.96]Drink more water.
[431:28.22]Try to eat at least one vegetable group a day.
[431:36.74]Cheese is good, but don't eat too much cheese.
[431:44.02]That's advice from the 1950s.
[431:47.77]Um... Eat less cheese?
[431:53.29]Increase your garlic intake and drink water?
[431:56.59]That's just like, hey... You wanna be a healthy motherfucker or not?
[432:09.38]Guys, Dr. House even says don't eat cheese.
[432:11.46]Dr. Greg House.
[432:13.63]And that was a TV show.
[432:14.49]It was a really popular TV show.
[432:16.19]And TV doesn't lie to you.
[432:18.35]Everything you see on TV is true.
[432:20.27]Even TV shows.
[432:22.81]Every episode of... Every episode of That's So Raven you've ever seen happened in real life.
[432:40.82]But yeah, just drink more water.
[432:41.88]Water helps.
[432:43.81]And moisturize, goddammit!
[432:45.69]Moisturize!
[432:47.01]Moisturize!
[432:47.65]You know how many people don't moisturize?
[432:51.28]When you get out of the shower, get a nice facial moisturizer and just put a small layer on and rub it in.
[432:56.50]Moisturize!
[432:59.62]Some of you guys are dry!
[433:00.82]You gotta moisturize, man!
[433:14.94]King of the skincare.
[433:16.72]Says the sludge streamer.
[433:20.43]No, you gotta moisturize, right?
[433:21.91]And yeah, I'm a sludge streamer because I'm under these heat lamps for like eight hours.
[433:28.03]Of course I'm gonna be sludgy.
[433:29.43]What do you want me to do?
[433:30.51]I have these like McDonald's heat lamps pointing down at me to keep me fucking warm and happy.
[433:41.82]Anyways.
[433:47.02]Thank you, Eb Boney, for the 300 bits.
[433:50.52]They say woo.
[433:53.84]Appreciate it.
[433:55.66]Sir Canine, thanks for the five dollars.
[434:00.00]Very cool video I thought you might get a laugh out of.
[434:02.94]And I love laughing.
[434:04.10]But I don't click links unless I click them first.
[434:09.27]Yes.
[434:10.07]Good thing I did.
[434:12.95]I don't click links unless I click them first.
[434:17.31]And do you want to know why?
[434:18.17]Because of links like the one you just gave me.
[434:30.14]I knew what it was.
[434:31.38]Just proving it to you.
[434:33.24]I don't click links until I click them first.
[434:41.56]Pretty cool video.
[434:43.62]Hey, Chris Bach.
[434:46.46]Thank you, ChrisBlock, for the 600 bits.
[434:48.12]Okay, Jerma, thank God.
[434:49.75]Why does everything have to come down to the last second with you?
[434:54.19]What?
[434:56.55]What do you mean?
[435:01.18]I'm sorry, if there's a timer, or if there's a period of time where I may allow to accomplish something, I still accomplished it in that time that I needed to.
[435:13.89]Oh no, the last second you did it.
[435:15.58]No, I did it in the allocated time that I needed to.
[435:21.16]That's what happened.
[435:27.20]Worst noise 2020.
[435:27.86]Why?
[435:43.77]It's hitting him.
[435:48.74]It's not hitting him.
[435:50.64]It's not hitting him.
[435:52.04]It's hitting him now.
[435:53.52]I got it.
[435:56.32]Holy shit.
[435:58.00]Holy shit.
[435:59.77]Holy shit.
[436:03.39]That was a... Okay, that was 30 seconds long.
[436:08.61]Holy fuck.
[436:16.56]Do you guys know, in Futurama, what's his name?
[436:21.17]Maurice LaMarche does this voice in Futurama as it's an alien scream thing.
[436:30.94]What is this?
[436:31.42]Hold on.
[436:31.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[436:34.10]The monster voice that Maurice LaMarche does.
[436:39.07]No.
[436:39.43]Why does this exist?
[436:40.97]Why does everybody make this video?
[436:42.71]No, do the screw.
[436:44.07]No, it's the Futurama thing.
[436:45.39]Hold on.
[437:16.58]Do you guys know what I'm talking about?
[437:17.60]It's this, like, I can't do it.
[437:22.24]It's crazy.
[437:22.90]It's incredibly talented.
[437:24.64]Where is it?
[437:27.30]Futurama Alien, like, scream.
[437:35.37]Hold on, I'll get it.
[437:42.03]No, not Zoidberg.
[437:42.73]That's Billy West.
[437:45.55]Oh, he can do this thing.
[437:47.17]Not Bender.
[437:47.67]No, no, no, no.
[437:48.76]Ah, shit.
[437:50.86]I need to find this.
[437:51.70]There it is.
[438:00.08]Otherworldly sounds that he does.
[438:01.52]My question is for Mr. LaMarche.
[438:03.78]I've heard of him.
[438:05.86]Monsieur LaMarche.
[438:08.02]I've heard you do some of the sound effects, specifically the belches for Wacko.
[438:13.68]Thank you.
[438:14.08]I am too, man.
[438:15.58]I am too.
[438:16.28]Alright, come on, where is it?
[438:19.92]No, no, no, don't talk about it.
[438:21.86]Do it.
[438:42.94]There it is.
[438:44.36]Yes.
[438:45.64]There it is.
[438:49.43]Now you know the thing I'm talking about.
[438:57.91]Okay.
[438:58.54]So now that you know what I'm talking about, here it is.
[439:17.59]put the fucking music back on oh that clip is on the internet forever and that's uh just the way it is this is the worst stream on Earth wait this one or or or like this channel
[439:43.73]Sorry you missed Lord of the Rings.
[439:44.93]We've watched all three of the movies.
[439:50.11]Why does it have to be just Earth?
[439:51.09]It can't be more than Earth?
[440:01.36]On this website?
[440:12.82]Anyways.
[440:15.78]Bulbaswag.
[440:16.40]Thanks, Bulbaswag.
[440:17.20]Desu for the 500 bits.
[440:20.88]I'm officially back from my vacation in Japan, but while I was there at night, I listened to your old TF2 commentary videos to sleep to.
[440:27.64]I'm an old fan.
[440:30.75]But I was wondering if you could give us another, hey, what's going on, everybody, and that tone you had.
[440:34.35]I've been feeling nostalgic.
[440:35.37]Sure.
[440:38.58]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[440:39.62]Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[440:42.80]And tonight, I'm going to be rewinding the clock a little bit and talking about the... And he'll never do that again.
[440:53.89]Ever.
[441:06.44]Thank you.
[441:09.57]Hey, Dove the Bird, thanks for 1,000 bits, 10 bucks.
[441:11.63]Hope this helps pay off the lawsuits for using the copyrighted content.
[441:15.24]I'll be alright.
[441:17.86]I'm not gonna get in trouble.
[441:19.40]Don't worry.
[441:23.60]Thanks, though.
[441:26.48]Dove the Bird, another 1,000 bits, 10 bucks from Dove the Bird.
[441:28.68]You're honestly a god gamer.
[441:30.13]This game has helped me clearly see that now.
[441:35.81]Yeah.
[441:36.79]I knew that.
[441:39.41]Sometimes it comes out.
[441:42.99]But yeah.
[441:44.57]Appreciate it.
[441:50.22]Uh, Pockets, thanks for the $5, Pockets.
[441:52.16]Hey, Jerma, I had to put down my cat last Friday.
[441:54.88]It's been a rough week.
[441:55.76]Sorry to hear that.
[441:56.69]That sucks.
[441:58.89]But I came home that night and watched you play Tony Hawk and it took my mind off everything just a little bit.
[442:02.95]I want to say thanks for that.
[442:05.23]And the streams and vids that have been a source of comfort since 2012.
[442:09.31]Wish I could give more.
[442:10.19]Hope your PT goes well.
[442:12.27]Making good thoughts for you.
[442:13.23]Thank you.
[442:14.35]I hope so too.
[442:16.73]Sorry to hear about your cat.
[442:22.75]Remember the good times you had.
[442:30.03]Thank you, Pockets.
[442:32.99]You've been around for a long time.
[442:34.21]Thanks for watching for that long.
[442:36.51]Wish you the best.
[442:40.10]Almost at the end here.
[442:40.80]We only have a few more.
[442:41.50]We're going to transition to the actual end of the stream.
[442:49.32]Thanks for watching, guys.
[442:50.38]We'll see you tomorrow.
[442:55.82]I'll show auto.
[442:56.36]Don't worry.
[442:58.92]I'll show Otto.
[442:59.28]Yes, that's true.
[443:01.30]The audiobooks by Roy Dotrice were the best way, I think, at some point to experience those books.
[443:27.73]They had somebody do... He did like three of them, right?
[443:33.81]Somebody else came in and did Feast for Crows.
[443:36.18]Yeah, he was awesome.
[443:39.70]He did all the voices.
[443:42.44]His narration was unbelievable.
[443:47.39]Yeah.
[443:48.29]If we even ever even fucking get Winds of Winter, I don't even know if it's gonna... I think it's gonna happen.
[443:52.27]I don't think it's gonna happen.
[443:54.21]Alright, put me on the list of people that... I don't think it's going to happen.
[443:57.35]I don't think we're going to get Winds of Winter.
[443:58.37]I don't think so.
[444:06.92]But anyways.
[444:08.38]Thanks a lot for the $10.
[444:09.14]GoldRubyProduction, thank you, GoldRuby.
[444:13.54]Thanks for the $2.50.
[444:15.75]It only took me about 30 seconds to decide that I definitely didn't want to miss another stream again.
[444:18.68]Now it feels like I was always here.
[444:20.62]That there was never a day that I didn't have these streams in my life.
[444:35.40]Thank you in chat for all the great laughs so far.
[444:37.18]I love you.
[444:38.68]Chat comes up with just as many interesting things.
[444:41.72]Sometimes more so than I could.
[444:43.97]You guys collectively come up with some of the fucking funniest shit I've ever seen or heard.
[444:49.09]I mean that.
[444:49.59]I look over and just laugh at some of the wild shit you guys write.
[444:55.14]Makes me laugh.
[444:57.02]Thank you.
[444:58.76]Thanks for checking the chat when you did and hopefully you stick around.
[445:02.96]Crack chat.
[445:03.74]No, they weren't crack chat tonight.
[445:06.86]A Poeme Lizard.
[445:09.14]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[445:10.10]Jeremiah, have you heard Momentary Bliss yet?
[445:13.46]What are your thoughts?
[445:14.00]I have not.
[445:15.12]Actually, I have not had a chance to do that.
[445:16.60]I'll have to do that tonight.
[445:19.16]That's the new Gorillaz song, right?
[445:21.66]Is that what you're referring to?
[445:23.02]Yeah, it is.
[445:27.92]Alright.
[445:28.16]I don't want to listen to it.
[445:30.14]I have to literally put headphones on and just close my eyes and lean back in my chair.
[445:36.38]And then listen to it like four more times.
[445:39.32]But I have not heard it yet.
[445:40.06]I'll give you my thoughts on what to do.
[445:42.90]FutureGamer, thanks for the $2.50.
[445:44.14]If you want to stream Dawn of War, consider playing the Ultimate Apocalypse mod.
[445:48.11]It adds a bunch of new factions, hundreds of new units, map-sized titans, and more.
[445:54.55]I feel like I loved the original so much that I might not want to do any mods.
[445:58.47]Maybe.
[445:58.59]Maybe.
[446:01.55]Maybe.
[446:05.95]Maybe we'll give it a try.
[446:09.33]Aw, Futz, thanks for the 300 bits.
[446:10.71]Hell yeah.
[446:10.95]Biological sciences.
[446:39.91]There's some smart cookies in here.
[446:42.41]I'm telling you.
[446:46.33]There's some smart people in here.
[446:47.55]Biological scientists, engineers, pilots, doctors.
[446:53.44]A bunch of fucking scientists.
[447:02.86]Hope you get through the hard times here.
[447:06.37]If it has to do with school, I know school can be... Especially college can be pretty daunting sometimes.
[447:12.53]Just take it slow.
[447:13.59]Do what you can.
[447:14.07]And just do your best.
[447:17.25]That's all you can do.
[447:21.44]StormGC, thanks for the five community subs.
[447:23.56]Storm gave a shitload of subs tonight, so thank you, Storm.
[447:27.58]And then finally, we have GooBerryJuice for 300 bits and JBong for 250.
[447:33.70]GooBerryJuice says...
[447:36.70]I don't know, what am I saying?
[447:43.06]I was wondering if you could show off your amazing pronunciation skills.
[447:47.89]And just say these few words for me.
[447:50.57]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[447:51.49]No, I don't, I don't know, I don't, ah, okay.
[447:55.39]Are these bad?
[447:56.25]These are not bad words, right?
[447:57.97]Pabushka.
[447:59.79]Pushtashir.
[448:00.33]Sapuku.
[448:02.37]Sapuku.
[448:04.48]I think I did okay.
[448:13.10]Just so you know, if you mess any of these up even slightly in pronunciation, I will be drafted into World War 3.
[448:18.94]I probably should have read that part.
[448:21.36]That being said, I know you'll do great.
[448:22.60]Thanks again.
[448:26.96]Well banned.
[448:28.08]Show auto real quick.
[448:31.77]Jaybong, thanks for the 250.
[448:33.03]Hey, Jerma, glad you're back.
[448:34.21]I recently had to let my dog go due to complications with her health.
[448:39.04]Sorry to hear that.
[448:40.38]She was my best friend for 10 years.
[448:42.58]Given unconditional love all the time, it's hard to see the spot she used to occupy in the house and not tear up.
[448:48.72]Glad you're back, man.
[448:50.36]Your streams really help give me a boost.
[448:55.38]Missing you all the time, Bella.
[448:56.64]Aww.
[448:58.07]Aww.
[449:00.97]Oh my god.
[449:01.77]Oh, they're adorable.
[449:12.92]This picture in particular is fucking fantastic.
[449:15.56]Hold on.
[449:17.30]It's a wink.
[449:18.38]It's so beautiful.
[449:19.18]That's tough, though.
[449:29.76]I've talked about the losing animals and being separated from animals before.
[449:34.70]And the way that I've dealt with it each time is you give yourself some time to grieve about it and sort of try to remember but move on.
[449:44.47]And then take care of another one.
[449:45.61]Take care of another animal.
[449:46.61]Bring another animal into your life.
[449:48.13]Dog, cat, rabbit, lizard, don't matter.
[449:56.41]Keep the love going on
[450:01.20]Somebody else that wants a home, right?
[450:03.32]Somebody else that wants to be your friend.
[450:07.90]Hey, look at this.
[450:10.78]Look at that.
[450:11.58]That's amazing.
[450:17.34]So cute.
[450:22.17]Sorry to hear about that.
[450:26.99]Thank you for sharing that.
[450:29.19]And good luck.
[450:32.38]Thanks for the 250.
[450:34.95]And finally, we had 500 bits from Allison J. What?
[450:38.23]There's a vomiting quest on RuneScape?
[450:41.33]Why?
[451:08.62]Oh my god, that's fucking ridiculous.
[451:22.32]That's fucking insane.
[451:24.08]That's like somebody... Okay, alright, that's enough.
[451:27.54]See you guys tomorrow.
[451:28.18]Goodbye.
[451:29.56]Holy shit.
[451:30.92]That was unbelievably awful.
[451:34.35]Hold on, I'm gonna turn off the audio for this.
[451:37.17]And... I just need to hear it myself.
[451:41.21]Warning, it says... Hold on.
[451:42.83]There's a warning in the RuneScape text.
[451:48.71]This says... Warning.
[451:50.49]Where's the warning?
[451:55.44]I just missed the warning.
[451:59.50]I don't even care.
[452:00.94]I just turned off the sound.
[452:01.68]Yeah, I'm not allowed.
[452:02.22]I don't care.
[452:03.38]Alright, see you guys tomorrow.
[452:05.42]Remember, 6 p.m.
[452:07.30]Pacific.
[452:07.66]We're starting really late tomorrow.
[452:10.87]Because I'm doing physical therapy.
[452:13.15]PT.
[452:13.65]It's easier to say that way.
[452:15.95]I know, I know, I know, Otto.
[452:17.27]I know, I know, I know, Otto.
[452:18.51]I know, I know, Otto.
[452:20.99]Let me see.
[452:21.57]Hold on.
[452:30.86]That's not Otto.
[452:32.18]That's not Otto.
[452:34.46]Yeah, that's blue.
[452:35.60]Hold on.
[452:35.98]Just wait a second.
[452:51.78]Otto's not even in the room anymore.
[452:53.44]Otto, he went, remember Kim came and he left.
[452:55.92]He's not, he's downstairs.
[452:56.76]I'm gone.
[452:57.62]I'll see you tomorrow.
[452:59.02]Otto's not even in the room.
[453:03.06]He went downstairs to go see Kit.
[453:04.56]Remember I let him out?
[453:05.24]Okay.
[453:06.18]We'll show him tomorrow.
[453:07.14]I promise.
[453:10.44]Goodbye.
[453:10.82]Was there any winks?
[453:13.44]No.
[453:15.28]I don't need to turn the camera on to say bye.
[453:16.94]Okay.
[453:17.28]Alright.
[453:17.76]Bye.
[453:19.68]See you tomorrow.
[453:20.52]Get some sleep.
[453:21.99]Goodnight.
