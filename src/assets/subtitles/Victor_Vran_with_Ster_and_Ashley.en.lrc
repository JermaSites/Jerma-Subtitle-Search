[00:25.12]What the hell?
[00:28.06]What are you doing?
[00:31.40]Are you blowing your nose?
[00:33.56]Did you blow... Yeah, did you just blow into, like, Streets of Rage 1 to try to get it to work?
[00:40.93]River City Ransom?
[00:45.41]Oh, that's too bad.
[00:48.11]Okay.
[00:49.38]Hi, everybody.

[02:30.47]Hi, everybody, how's it going?
[02:31.67]Metacomps, we got Boo!
[02:36.83]See, nobody could hear anybody, so everyone just really thought Boo was probably here.
[02:40.01]I'm sorry, guys.
[02:41.39]Wait, what happened to him?
[02:44.04]Yeah, where did he go?
[02:45.08]Is he in the call anymore?
[02:47.38]Boo?
[02:48.88]Shit, he's gone.
[02:49.62]Is Boo in the call?
[02:52.31]That's a reference to a video I made.
[02:54.05]Yeah.
[02:56.44]Alright.
[02:58.24]I forget my entire kit.
[02:59.84]Those are because 50 is max level, huh?
[03:03.13]So this is, guys, this is Victor Vran.
[03:04.82]If you don't know what Victor Vran is, it's because... Really good game.
[03:09.56]It's very good.
[03:10.20]It's a fun game.
[03:11.28]It's worth checking out.
[03:12.32]We've played this game for like... I've played it for like 21 hours.
[03:16.24]He's played it for like 40.
[03:18.32]We haven't even talked about this game one time.
[03:20.38]I would like to correct you.
[03:21.36]It's 45 hours.
[03:22.90]Whatever.
[03:23.22]Okay.
[03:24.44]The five is important.
[03:26.20]So, it's an action RPG.
[03:28.60]It's one of the better ones to come out in a long time.
[03:30.95]It's just made by an independent studio.
[03:34.19]So, it's really good.
[03:36.89]I would check it out if I were you if you like action RPGs, if you haven't already.
[03:39.91]It's made by Tropico.
[03:41.57]Yes, it's by the Tropico devs.
[03:42.93]It's all about building the character based around these cards down here.
[03:46.92]It's so funny, like, trying to explain, like, the end game of this game.
[03:50.24]We haven't...
[03:51.39]We just, like, turned the stream.
[03:53.32]I just turned on the stream just because, ah, stream today.
[03:55.76]We're at the end of the entire video game.
[03:58.00]Hi, guys.
[03:58.88]Yeah.
[03:59.46]Well, there is a patch.
[04:00.41]There's a free DLC that added end-game content on Thursday.
[04:03.95]Yeah, last Thursday, actually.
[04:07.06]And we thought, you know, let's, let's, we have the crew together right now.
[04:09.68]Why aren't we playing the game?
[04:10.80]So we got together, we played the game.
[04:13.06]Now we don't know what any of our characters do or how to play anymore, but we're at the end of the game.
[04:18.61]They turned on the game.
[04:19.55]What is my character?
[04:21.17]What does he do?
[04:22.25]Yeah.
[04:23.07]I really don't know.
[04:24.47]I had a whole very particular thing set up and I don't, I have no idea, dude.
[04:29.55]Well, I know that I was, let's see.
[04:32.23]I was probably about right.
[04:35.11]I'm crit boy and I have two swords.
[04:38.05]I'm rainbow girl.
[04:42.75]You're gonna die, girl.
[04:44.09]I'm going to die because my character is like 20 levels below everyone else.
[04:51.11]I was lightning man.
[04:53.63]I don't remember any of this shit.
[04:54.85]I'm sure we'll figure it out as we go.
[04:56.69]But the cool part about this game is not so much...
[05:00.31]Oh, look at all these legendary items!
[05:02.46]Every item set in the game has its own attack animations and its own kind of way you play with the item set.
[05:10.34]So for instance, if I put a scythe on, I can even remember how to equip items.
[05:15.46]Do you?
[05:16.85]Not really.
[05:18.71]Okay, so for instance, if I put on... Let me put this in my inventory.
[05:24.27]What the fuck is going on here?
[05:26.89]He doesn't know how to do it.
[05:28.91]Why is it doing this?
[05:30.48]It's the letter I, Jerma.
[05:31.95]No, no, no, like, is it because my keyboard is, okay, that's why.
[05:36.57]Why are you injured?
[05:38.47]Me?
[05:39.41]Yeah.
[05:40.51]Probably standing in my own electricity.
[05:42.49]Huh.
[05:43.65]Alright.
[05:43.85]Alright, so I'm holding a sword right now, and the sword has, all the swords have their own attack, like, animations.
[05:51.10]Not all of them, but, like, they're all, like, different looking and cool looking.
[05:53.74]If I switch over to my, like, gun, for instance, all the guns, like, look different and act differently and stuff.
[05:59.25]It's really, really cool.
[06:01.38]thing is like a lightsaber but if I put on let's see if I have another like random sword in here oh that's what I was doing I have some rethinking to do here this sword is cool looking like this but this one has a different like animation and different colors and everything it's kind of like the diablo 3 rune system but every weapon is kind of like a ruin essentially
[06:29.01]And they all have different ways they act.
[06:32.23]Don't cross the streams.
[06:33.69]Don't worry.
[06:34.11]I will.
[06:35.03]Many times.
[06:37.64]God, I remember making that joke.
[06:40.48]Remember when we made that joke?
[06:42.48]It's a good joke.
[06:45.18]Alright, so I need to actually remember what the hell... I think my... Remember there was like a bug where your items would get deleted?
[06:53.05]I'm pretty sure... Yeah, that happened to you.
[06:54.45]Yeah, that happened to me.
[06:55.37]I had, like, a thing that I was doing, and all, like, my main item got deleted.
[07:00.83]And then that's when I was like, oh, shit, and I didn't know what to do.
[07:03.05]So, but we're just gonna put on... This is a lightning gun.
[07:06.43]50% more attack speed.
[07:07.37]What was my secondary that I had?
[07:13.74]Probably this one, to be honest.
[07:15.90]Oh, no, it was probably a cannon.
[07:17.30]Where's that good cannon I had?
[07:21.62]Chicken cannon repeater.
[07:24.87]Oh, you got the ticket cannon too?
[07:26.67]Yeah, I just recently got it.
[07:27.89]The purple is legendary.
[07:29.55]The purple is like the super good items.
[07:32.03]Green is decent.
[07:33.19]Yellow is good.
[07:36.13]Green's like the blue from Diablo.
[07:40.03]Yellow is pretty much the yellow from Diablo, and this is like the unique or legendary purple.
[07:46.51]Gotta transmute.
[07:48.68]Let's play this game.
[07:49.84]What do you say?
[07:50.38]Hold on.
[07:52.37]One second.
[07:53.51]I just had the epiphany when I realized that my character was terrible.
[07:56.71]I re-had that epiphany, and like, why, um, why this is the good character?
[08:01.31]We're just gonna have to, like, play and figure it out again.
[08:04.21]I know, I'm just saying, I'm just putting in one card, then I'm, like, done.
[08:07.05]I just gotta find a card that costs under four, but less than five, but more than six.
[08:12.53]Alright, so, why this game is so cool...
[08:16.56]is, it's a really fun, like, there's a dodge mechanic, there's a jumping mechanic in this game.
[08:21.25]You actually can jump around and like wall jump on walls, which is like unheard of in like most top-down action RPGs like this.
[08:28.16]But, every level is kind of its own instance.
[08:32.63]Right?
[08:32.85]So if you take a look over here, the stars are the things that I've already completed.
[08:36.63]But you have these little quests inside of the quest, kind of.
[08:41.50]So take a look at that.
[08:42.94]Slay shard sentinels with ranged attacks.
[08:45.42]Shard sentinels are probably like a really difficult enemy that's in here.
[08:48.56]That you have to kill six of them and they have to die by a ranged attack.
[08:52.73]That's the only way you can complete that.
[08:55.11]And they're different every time.
[08:56.03]They're different for, there's elite challenges, like these are the super, super duper hard ones.
[09:00.38]And to do a lot of these elite challenges, like these ones are normal.
[09:03.74]These are elite.
[09:04.92]And over here on the right, you have to activate certain of these difficulty modifiers.
[09:10.43]Like Hex of Malice.
[09:11.43]Monsters hit for 50% more damage and cripple you for 2 seconds.
[09:15.57]On crit.
[09:16.91]That's pretty horrible.
[09:19.13]And some of these require you to have them on.
[09:22.18]Like Hex of Time.
[09:23.06]Monsters move faster.
[09:23.56]It's coming back to me.
[09:25.48]But take a look, you get 10% more XP and you find more items.
[09:28.86]Hey, we haven't even seen the spellbook yet.
[09:31.22]That's the whole other thing that I forgot about as well.
[09:35.20]And you can activate as many of these as you want, which makes the game extremely difficult at times.
[09:42.52]But if you take a look, let's go back to regular challenges here.
[09:45.12]I'm just going to go in here just so they can see what this game looks like.
[09:49.15]So I'm looking at a menu screen.
[09:53.36]So it plays pretty much like you would expect, right?
[10:00.96]But I have all the... Did I have all the hexes on?
[10:06.14]I do, right?
[10:07.64]Most of them.
[10:09.68]I forget where you look to see that.
[10:13.86]But look, you can wall jump, you can jump around.
[10:17.33]Oh, the wall jump.
[10:18.57]Yeah, you can actually get to secret areas and stuff.
[10:23.11]It's pretty cool.
[10:24.01]There actually is one right here.
[10:25.95]There it is.
[10:26.37]Boing.
[10:28.53]Boing.
[10:29.47]That's the sound it makes when you find it.
[10:31.21]Boing.
[10:31.75]There's nothing in here, though.
[10:33.23]Oh, there's a chest in here.
[10:34.80]Is there?
[10:35.82]Oh, okay.
[10:39.38]And items that drop in this game, they don't...
[10:43.12]They don't, this is not like a game about, whoa, the boss dropped like 30 items.
[10:47.88]Not really, how the fuck did you get, there we go.
[10:53.34]It's more so a game about like the dodging and action mechanics.
[10:58.11]It's an action game that's kind of, you can move the camera around.
[11:01.03]Oh yeah, isn't there a roll or something?
[11:02.93]Yeah, there is a roll.
[11:04.11]It's a left bumper by default.
[11:05.67]This game is, I'm playing this with a controller.
[11:09.05]It actually feels cleaner with a controller, in my opinion.
[11:15.77]I'm so clean.
[11:17.43]Feels super clean.
[11:22.48]Are these the shard sentinels?
[11:24.00]Nobody has to die with ranged?
[11:27.38]Yeah.
[11:28.54]And that's all you're using.
[11:30.40]I really don't like this item, the one I'm using right now, because if you guys are noticing, this legendary, when I dodge, makes a giant electrical field.
[11:38.41]Alright, so we just completed that.
[11:40.15]So one little item popped out.
[11:42.81]You typically, when you complete one of these challenges, you'll get maybe one item.
[11:46.83]Maybe.
[11:50.08]Maybe you'll get some gold, maybe you'll get experience.
[11:59.46]Switch over to the other thing.
[12:02.06]There's crits, there's double damage, triple damage, there's all kinds of things.
[12:05.47]It's an action RPG.
[12:06.47]Yeah, there's crits.
[12:10.45]Help me, help me.
[12:11.41]I'm doing it.
[12:13.29]I'm remembering.
[12:13.97]I'm remembering how, like, stupid this character was.
[12:16.99]Yeah, so this mortar that I have shoots a huge, long, slow ultra blast.
[12:26.18]Is that how you call it?
[12:28.06]An ultra blast?
[12:31.28]And you can switch on the fly, as you notice I'm switching between the electric gun and then, you know, launching some mortars.
[12:37.38]As you notice.
[12:38.99]You've got a super funny, super hilarious narrator.
[12:43.59]Didn't we, like, hate that?
[12:48.07]No, we thought it was cool.
[12:49.83]I don't remember, I remember just being annoyed.
[12:51.49]There's a chest up there, looks like a wall bouncer.
[12:54.78]Why does this game look so pro- oh, see, this is like, let's say I could walk through this wall.
[12:58.87]Why does this game look so promising?
[13:00.36]Because it is.
[13:01.66]It's a very good game.
[13:03.38]Very well made.
[13:04.00]Extremely recommended.
[13:05.40]We're making a couple of... Well, the reason we're playing it, there's a free DLC in there.
[13:08.44]It's supposed to be making another campaign and a whole bunch of stuff.
[13:12.39]And we all get to be Victor Bram!
[13:14.45]Yeah, all of us get to be Victor.
[13:16.51]Awesome!
[13:17.39]So what else do we need to do in here?
[13:21.14]There we go.
[13:21.84]Did you ever do the don't get hit thing in here?
[13:24.60]Those have been, I can't, I'm always, I'll lose those every time.
[13:28.80]Reach the end of the corridor within 30 seconds without taking damage or using any powers.
[13:36.23]I don't think I can do that.
[13:38.01]You have to get the speed potions and shit.
[13:42.90]How much is the game?
[13:45.08]20 bucks a day?
[13:47.98]Here's the real question.
[13:50.43]Yeah.
[13:51.19]What are we actually doing?
[13:52.67]Where's the new area?
[13:53.27]And how do we get to the end game thing?
[13:54.93]I don't know.
[13:55.87]I have one thing on my map where I've never been, but I think that's just a coincidence.
[13:59.01]Well, hold on.
[13:59.57]Let's go back to the map.
[14:02.33]Uh... Return to hub.
[14:04.56]There are no town portals.
[14:05.48]You just can teleport back whenever you want.
[14:07.86]You come back to this hub area here.
[14:10.94]Is there a person with, like, a quest or something?
[14:14.78]Look for the... Yeah, look for the exclamation point.
[14:18.78]Yeah.
[14:19.76]There's the arena on the left.
[14:21.90]What was the place called, do you know?
[14:24.00]Bottomless Pit was that arena.
[14:30.01]I feel like it's gonna be... Is it the Freak Show?
[14:33.73]No.
[14:35.27]No, that's where if you want to get owned.
[14:36.95]The Deep Binds?
[14:38.87]I don't have anything done in here.
[14:40.99]No, that's not it either.
[14:42.10]That's not it?
[14:43.60]The only thing I don't have, and I don't think it's a new area, is the Stock Room.
[14:49.15]Well, it was called like the Chaos DLC or something, right?
[14:52.51]We should have figured this out.
[14:53.89]If there's anything we should have figured out... Oh, but no, no, no, but really the cool part about this game, the seriously awesome part that me and you, Star, played this for like at least a couple hours straight, the PvP.
[15:06.86]The PvP was like actually very, very fun to like try to... When it didn't desync.
[15:11.74]When it didn't desync, but... It was fun to try.
[15:16.94]The stars are like the level of completion that you've done in each area.
[15:20.24]What's this one?
[15:20.86]The Reformatory?
[15:22.26]If there's more to do there, then the stars won't be filled in.
[15:27.66]Yeah, so you can be really completionist about it.
[15:31.26]Like five stars, zero stars, these are places that I don't think I've even gone to.
[15:35.31]Whispering Burrows?
[15:37.13]I've actually done almost all of them.
[15:40.17]Do you have the reformatory unlocked all the way to the left?
[15:45.13]For me, it's locked.
[15:46.97]Yeah, I have it unlocked.
[15:49.47]The DLC area is called the Cauldron of Chaos.
[15:52.41]Cauldron of Chaos.
[15:54.41]Wasn't that near the boss?
[15:56.19]That was just a regular area before.
[15:58.37]I don't know.
[16:01.13]That's the Sanctum, the Deep Mines, the Stock Room, the Junction, Steam Quarter.
[16:07.16]Oh, Steam!
[16:07.62]Oh, it gave in!
[16:09.79]Good one.
[16:10.11]Creepshow.
[16:15.09]Hey, if anything has Steam, you have to say, like, GabeN, because it's wicked fun.
[16:19.85]No, it's not.
[16:22.35]I'm doing, I'm making a parody.
[16:23.47]I'm doing a parody on that.
[16:25.25]Can we play a game?
[16:26.81]I don't know where I'm supposed to go.
[16:28.11]Alright, I'm just gonna, just, I'm gonna go to, uh... Alright, well, can... I don't wanna, like, just search for stuff on Wikipedia while I'm streaming.
[16:40.52]There's 600 people in here waiting for us to play the video game.
[16:43.41]I'm gonna go here.
[16:45.89]Where's here?
[16:46.33]I haven't done this yet.
[16:47.39]Just come to me.
[16:48.93]Alright.
[16:51.77]There's two secrets here that I haven't gotten.
[16:54.37]Teleporting to doorstop.
[16:56.38]Yeah.
[16:57.58]Kill monsters without using potions or demon powers, so don't use a potion.
[17:01.50]And we have to slay monsters within 320 seconds without using a shrine.
[17:06.20]I'll let you be easy.
[17:08.85]This chap was a little scary when he was alone.
[17:11.18]Go there.
[17:11.96]I'm reading.
[17:12.74]Just don't use a potion, trying to get smoked, you know what I mean?
[17:16.28]I'm gonna stand very far back because I'm way under level.
[17:21.38]That's right, I forgot.
[17:23.42]Maybe nobody will notice me.
[17:25.44]Hey, maybe you'll get a lot of experience points at least.
[17:29.06]I hope so.
[17:31.25]We're gonna find out.
[17:31.93]See if my chicken gun is still relevant.
[17:36.47]I didn't get a rainbow gun too.
[17:39.53]What do I have to do?
[17:41.12]Kill!
[17:41.98]Kill, kill, kill!
[17:43.96]Hey dude, how you doing?
[17:44.80]You can use, uh, potions or anything like that.
[17:46.78]You can kill a hundred and something.
[17:48.36]A hundred and twenty-one.
[17:51.26]I don't have anything in this area either.
[17:53.44]Oh!
[17:53.90]Oh!
[17:54.34]Maybe we're onto something.
[17:56.46]Maybe we're onto something.
[17:59.31]Shit, I just took away too much damage.
[18:01.55]I took no damage at all!
[18:03.53]Oh, this is gonna be great.
[18:06.02]No one invited you to play.
[18:08.13]I did.
[18:09.31]What?
[18:09.51]I invited myself.
[18:11.53]She was welcome.
[18:12.21]I was welcome.
[18:13.47]Act like she wasn't welcome.
[18:14.21]I'm gonna help you guys with my rainbows.
[18:16.93]We are 15 out of 100.
[18:17.79]Oh boy, I'm almost dead too.
[18:27.29]What's that do?
[18:28.63]What's this rainbow gun?
[18:29.57]That thing's amazing.
[18:30.89]I just crafted it.
[18:32.23]Oh, what?
[18:32.71]Like before the strip.
[18:34.41]That's incredible.
[18:35.21]I wish I had that.
[18:36.27]What does it do?
[18:36.79]It shoots rainbows.
[18:38.85]Yeah, but what's like the cool thing that it's like?
[18:40.95]The rainbow just do 25% more rainbow damage.
[18:44.21]I don't know, I just, all I know is that it's a big rainbow.
[18:46.77]I can look at it.
[18:47.71]Hey, when you split up these things, I don't think the, uh, the mini guys count as kills, by the way.
[18:52.91]I'll look at it after we're out of danger here.
[18:54.65]If I remember correctly.
[18:57.64]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[18:58.34]It's some of the grunts.
[18:59.28]It's a grunt.
[18:59.56]Legendary!
[19:00.88]Really?
[19:01.18]Legendary.
[19:02.04]Uh, what, that, it's one of the demon powers that I have, like, 10 of.
[19:05.42]Oh, what?
[19:05.92]Demon powers don't count.
[19:11.32]Playing monsters without using potions or demon power is almost there.
[19:15.25]And then I can finally heal myself.
[19:19.07]Good thing this stun has so much range.
[19:22.99]Good thing I'm doing everything.
[19:24.33]Thanks!
[19:28.04]Don't say that.
[19:30.12]Oh, it sucks health out of things.
[19:31.96]Oh wait, no, that's my card.
[19:33.06]I'm dead.
[19:37.62]There it is.
[19:38.78]Look how beautiful my rainbow gun is.
[19:40.88]It turns everything into prisms of happiness.
[19:43.53]I think we're missing something else, too.
[19:46.93]What's the other thing, Tanon?
[19:49.17]You're out of time.
[19:49.83]Ah!
[19:49.95]No, we only killed one champion in that time period.
[19:54.91]Wow, we suck.
[19:56.03]Oh, fuck, I just jumped into that.
[20:00.19]Ra-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
[20:02.82]That was... I don't like it here, it's just like... That's awesome.
[20:15.86]I love how you're doing that.
[20:16.76]See, this game is fun!
[20:18.65]Get me out of here!
[20:22.61]I'm stuck down here.
[20:25.33]Sorry, I can't provide my rainbow cover fire.
[20:34.20]He's got a card.
[20:34.96]Divine Justice!
[20:40.94]I really want to get one of the Spellbooks.
[20:42.44]It's a new item they added.
[20:45.51]I would also like to get one of the Spellbooks.
[20:47.07]Yeah, what's with the Spellbooks?
[20:48.17]I mentioned that.
[20:49.97]Didn't do that, we failed that one.
[20:52.63]What's this, the last challenge?
[20:54.49]Slay monsters.
[20:55.41]Okay, we have to kill 20 more things in a minute.
[20:57.51]Let's go.
[20:58.84]Find me things!
[20:59.50]Find me things!
[21:00.14]You guys are... You guys are...
[21:06.15]Oh, oh.
[21:07.55]Find me death.
[21:12.81]Shiver me timbers.
[21:16.64]Why did you say that?
[21:23.55]Eat it, skeleton.
[21:28.18]My favorite thing about Raiders of Rage is that- One more, we have to kill one more thing.
[21:33.18]Raiders of Rage in general.
[21:35.40]Oh, come on, please.
[21:37.02]We need to kill one thing in 30 seconds.
[21:38.90]Oh, there's a thing up on the ledge.
[21:40.34]I can shoot it.
[21:41.20]Get him.
[21:42.24]But if my gun doesn't do enough damage.
[21:44.68]No.
[21:45.66]Help.
[21:45.92]Kill him.
[21:46.55]Help.
[21:47.67]Sir.
[21:50.89]Get it.
[21:52.01]I'm doing everything already.
[21:53.19]Leave me alone.
[21:53.87]Do everything.
[21:55.85]We got it.
[21:56.17]We're good.
[21:57.44]Come on.
[21:58.34]Just look at your stream to see how much damage you're doing.
[22:03.71]Dude, I told you, my item got deleted.
[22:05.75]Don't you remember that?
[22:06.57]That's why I have to redo this whole character.
[22:09.10]Level up!
[22:09.74]We have like 13 more to go.
[22:28.28]Hey, what y'all doin'?
[22:34.42]Those poor skeletons.
[22:35.72]Yeah, the one, like, complaint that we had about this game was not about how the game wasn't fun or the game is not really great.
[22:44.91]There's, like, five enemies in the whole game.
[22:47.41]Yeah.
[22:48.27]There's, like, skeleton, spider.
[22:49.90]Is there a secret here?
[22:50.82]Oh, shit, speaking of skeletons.
[22:53.98]Ooh, there is.
[22:56.40]Wait, what's the noise for the finding the secret?
[23:00.60]There it is, the burp.
[23:04.04]Yes, we heard it.
[23:05.80]It was pretty low, I wanted you to hear it.
[23:08.10]Yeah, there's like elemental, skeleton, spider, zombie, vampire, gargoyle.
[23:16.27]That's pretty much every enemy in the game.
[23:18.51]Hey, use the statue.
[23:19.83]We're not gonna screw up anything.
[23:21.91]Only for you.
[23:24.95]Did we fail yet?
[23:25.77]I don't even know what we're doing.
[23:29.48]We are.
[23:29.90]We need to find two secrets.
[23:33.87]Well, did you just skip the one me and Ashley just got?
[23:36.57]I thought they would complete it if somebody got it in here.
[23:38.65]Did they change that?
[23:39.23]No, you have to get it.
[23:40.33]No, only for secrets, you have to get them all.
[23:42.41]That's my complaint about this game, because the two people in your party can go and do something, and you can be, like, a foot away from the objective, and it doesn't count off that you've done it.
[23:52.48]So you'll randomly reach a door that's open for them, but not you.
[23:55.04]That was because you didn't actually do it.
[23:58.08]There it is.
[23:59.22]Every time there was, like, someone you had to talk to, you just didn't talk to.
[24:01.76]Exactly!
[24:02.94]Exactly, that's stupid.
[24:06.37]Maybe you should have talked to him.
[24:09.19]Mr. Skeletal is a chump compared to Skeleton.
[24:11.23]For half of them, the person I was supposed to talk to wasn't even there.
[24:14.05]Because I hadn't talked to a person three towns ago.
[24:18.22]Listen.
[24:19.10]And I played for, like... Look, look, look.
[24:21.92]The most important thing, actually, is you have the rainbow gun.
[24:25.54]I do!
[24:26.20]I have the rainbow gun.
[24:27.46]I don't see any complaints.
[24:29.30]If you get to use the rainbow gun.
[24:30.34]You got the chicken gun and the rainbow gun, you're just like... I have all the best weaponry in the game, whoa.
[24:35.74]Oh shit, annoying.
[24:37.38]Don't stand in the electro, uh, go.
[24:40.76]I am magnificent, sir.
[24:42.32]You will take that back.
[24:44.40]You're average.
[24:45.24]Did you see that overkill?
[24:46.36]It was like 400 damage.
[24:49.31]I crafted this rainbow gun myself.
[24:50.37]I crit for a thousand.
[24:52.35]My own hands.
[24:53.57]Wanna see how I crit for?
[24:55.01]If you can see it.
[24:59.04]No spellbooks yet.
[25:00.30]Where the hell are they?
[25:01.22]I wanna get the new item type.
[25:05.18]Dancing shotgun of the ram.
[25:06.50]Is this a skull island?
[25:09.25]No.
[25:10.65]This is a regular island.
[25:11.65]We have not been down here, have we?
[25:13.03]No.
[25:18.72]Will you do another lap?
[25:20.16]Another really great thing.
[25:21.26]Here's a really great thing about this game.
[25:22.53]You see the breadcrumb trail?
[25:24.55]I wish more action RPGs did this.
[25:26.83]You see the little dotted line?
[25:27.86]That's where our characters all have walked.
[25:30.82]Yeah, you can do like the Fog of War thing and go, that's where you've been, but that actually shows you physically where you were standing like less than a minute ago.
[25:37.94]That's so, so cool.
[25:40.34]Can somebody please give the, these developers, these are the Tropico guys we were talking, somebody please give these guys like a hundred million dollars.
[25:49.54]So they can make like another one of these games, but make it like a huge, like, like competitor to like all the other ones.
[25:56.91]My rainbow gun does 50% more damage when my overdrive meter is full.
[26:00.85]And I don't use that anyway, so... There you go.
[26:04.07]Damn.
[26:05.83]Can you find the other secret yet?
[26:07.95]I don't see it.
[26:09.65]Shit.
[26:09.97]There's the one over here.
[26:11.11]What about over on the left?
[26:13.13]It looks like an area you can jump to over there on the left.
[26:25.23]I'm gonna try it.
[26:25.77]We'll just have to wrap around again.
[26:29.79]Where did Sir go?
[26:30.39]Uh, I don't know.
[26:32.18]I'm back to trying to figure out where the DLC stuff is.
[26:35.46]That's probably a good idea.
[26:36.46]I see.
[26:38.38]It's on the case.
[26:40.98]Nothing down there, right?
[26:41.78]We can't, like, jump over there.
[26:42.89]I wanna go down there and play in the pond.
[26:45.23]I wanna get rid of this annoying gun that, like, hurts me when I dodge.
[26:47.95]Like, watch.
[26:49.79]Oh, I'm gonna dodge!
[26:50.85]Oh, there's an enemy over there.
[26:51.83]Wait, this doesn't hurt me?
[26:56.11]I thought those did hurt me.
[26:58.45]Uh, you were injured before in, like, the spawn area.
[27:02.28]Something hurt you.
[27:04.76]I remember that.
[27:05.62]These hurt you.
[27:06.68]If you walked into this... Oh, there we go.
[27:10.89]Why is it just this one hurting me?
[27:12.41]Jeremy, you're sitting here trying to hurt yourself.
[27:14.65]I'm just doing some testing.
[27:18.33]We can get you some help.
[27:21.22]Jerma is the dungeon master.
[27:23.65]Ooh, something on the ground.
[27:24.49]I don't know about that.
[27:25.91]Okay, I think it's up here.
[27:29.01]Hey, Hatera.
[27:31.05]I know you.
[27:31.59]Uh, found it.
[27:35.43]We get to complete this, I think.
[27:38.65]Right?
[27:39.46]Uh.
[27:43.32]Oh.
[27:45.42]No, seriously, what's in it?
[27:47.10]Uh, I don't know.
[27:48.36]This looks like it should be a secret.
[27:49.86]There it is.
[27:51.27]Secret empty hole!
[27:52.95]Yeah, that's where I thought it was on the map, but I can't actually go there.
[27:56.11]Whoa!
[27:57.97]Kinda moves.
[27:58.37]Are you critting for a thousand, Star?
[28:02.17]I just did like a 1600 crit.
[28:04.57]Jealous!
[28:06.01]Aw, I forgot with Brutality Mine, you're like 15 minutes.
[28:09.76]That guy just almost needs to kill me.
[28:14.34]Do you want to get this before we open it?
[28:16.86]Eh?
[28:17.22]What?
[28:17.96]I mean, do you want to, like, get in here before we... No, I think I know where I'm going.
[28:21.95]Right.
[28:24.95]Ooh, flag.
[28:26.03]Woo!
[28:27.83]Something about these little bubbles, I love collecting them.
[28:30.63]I know, just like in LittleBigPlanet.
[28:33.05]They make the most satisfying noise ever.
[28:35.13]I'm eating peanut butter panic ice cream.
[28:40.10]What?
[28:40.90]What is peanut butter panic?
[28:41.94]What do you mean?
[28:44.54]Somebody said that.
[28:46.38]So we don't have these... We did everything we can in here for the normal challenges without putting... We don't have the hexes on.
[28:55.32]Yeah, that didn't feel like a hex run.
[28:57.19]No, it wasn't.
[28:57.75]Because I didn't die.
[28:59.13]No, it was not a hex run.
[29:01.25]If I die, that means there's hexes on, which... Yeah.
[29:05.13]That's how you know.
[29:06.49]Alright, let's go back.
[29:07.66]I want to actually take a look at... I might go with sword, man.
[29:12.95]Because after my weapon being deleted, I hate this new weapon.
[29:16.61]Seriously, I hate this one.
[29:21.48]Why is your name Doorstop?
[29:22.66]I don't know.
[29:24.72]Why is anybody's name anything in the world we live in?
[29:27.86]My name is Square Ashley Square.
[29:30.66]Well, my name is Doorstop.
[29:34.05]Do we have an issue?
[29:35.03]Alright, I'm going to make Star really upset.
[29:38.83]I'm going to use a side...
[29:41.89]Oh my god.
[29:42.71]What's wrong with the scythe?
[29:44.13]Can I go play by myself?
[29:45.19]He hates scythes.
[29:47.21]I got a scythe.
[29:47.91]The scythe was like a joke added to the game so bad people would accidentally use it.
[29:54.33]It's fun to use the scythe.
[29:55.77]Don't be such a... Don't be such a fucking butt head.
[29:58.89]It's fun to like just die.
[30:00.76]The scythe has like really random damage.
[30:05.10]It can either do like five or like two hundred.
[30:07.84]The scythe has really random damage.
[30:09.32]It never does any.
[30:11.12]Yeah, or that.
[30:12.08]Because all of its abilities are ass.
[30:14.67]But my side is... Mine's different.
[30:20.05]Which one's cooler?
[30:20.77]Alright, whatever one has the cooler animations wins.
[30:25.97]I think they're the same.
[30:28.27]No, this one's different.
[30:29.63]Whoa!
[30:29.99]This one shoots rocks out.
[30:32.05]Okay.
[30:32.43]This kind of looks like old, faded dollar bills, not rocks.
[30:36.31]It's like old paper money.
[30:38.12]Yeah.
[30:41.00]Ooh, treasure keys.
[30:42.00]Did you ever figure that shit out?
[30:45.24]Treasures.
[30:47.52]Oh, treasure keys.
[30:48.30]This is really important.
[30:49.06]We need to see what the whirlwind looks like.
[30:54.79]Wow, whirlwind.
[30:55.49]That's so cool.
[30:58.47]I actually like this one.
[31:00.37]Dervish is this one.
[31:01.19]This one's dervish.
[31:03.59]This is the one with the armor penetration, which is probably good.
[31:06.11]How do you bring up the map?
[31:08.35]Oh, I found it.
[31:10.73]Is Nightbot in my stream, or did he leave again?
[31:14.21]He.
[31:15.66]Or her.
[31:16.22]She left.
[31:17.34]Why?
[31:18.04]It wasn't there during the last stream you did.
[31:19.82]I don't know.
[31:20.90]Why does that keep happening?
[31:24.14]Hold on a second.
[31:27.90]There's better things to do, Jerma.
[31:29.42]Stick around your stream.
[31:30.76]Can I just put him in right now?
[31:35.83]Yeah, you just go to Nightbot website and you click join.
[31:40.56]Why does it keep doing that?
[31:43.88]You and Ashley both don't know how to stream.
[31:46.14]Huh?
[31:47.50]You need the wizard to come by and solve everything.
[31:51.40]It's true.
[31:51.88]It'd be easier that way.
[31:57.57]Go to the website and then you hit the join button.
[32:01.19]Yeah, I know.
[32:02.03]He just, for some reason, leaves.
[32:03.33]Maybe, is he on like a
[32:06.40]Timer or something?
[32:08.02]It?
[32:10.97]It's not called It Bot.
[32:16.01]I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[32:16.95]Get in here, Nightbot.
[32:19.49]Okay, Nightbot.
[32:20.75]Please get in here.
[32:21.59]And please don't leave.
[32:24.45]There he is.
[32:32.30]He's here.
[32:32.64]Okay.
[32:33.64]Okay.
[32:37.93]Nightbot, thank you for coming and leaving again.
[32:40.75]There we go.
[32:47.26]I am failing my mission.
[32:49.72]What's your mission?
[32:55.92]Where is my thing?
[33:15.75]that's that alright let's go back to what we were doing we were playing a video game last time I checked so if you look at the map by the uh the bottomless pit right below that I noticed hey there's this uh it's like broken house that's all red that is the cauldron of chaos oh I do not know how to go there
[33:39.38]I just ran around the royal crypt and there's no actual entrance to it as far as I could tell.
[33:44.40]What?
[33:45.59]Do you see the demon world?
[33:47.29]Maybe we have to go to the demon world and come down, maybe?
[33:49.79]I don't know.
[33:53.07]Let me see, what happens if I go to the demon world?
[33:58.11]That was like one of the end game areas.
[34:05.44]God, I love inventory management in this game.
[34:08.76]It's so fun to look at all your little shiny things and ugh, so many.
[34:13.18]It's on the forums for the game because it's new.
[34:21.82]What, I redrew a bedtime story?
[34:25.50]It's not time for bed.
[34:26.52]It's time for Victor Vran.
[34:29.06]Yeah, it's time to play Victor Vran.
[34:30.92]It's not time for you to go to bed.
[34:32.16]Ugh.
[34:40.59]The bottom split's like the arena, though.
[34:42.39]I don't think that's... Maybe we have to find it some secret way.
[34:47.36]And you said it's absolutely not in the crypt.
[34:52.44]Yeah, I look... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go to the demon world and just look around.
[35:12.86]How many times have I let my imagination drift into a demon world of my mind's devising?
[35:17.54]I have gazed upon mountains of fire and molten rock.
[35:23.40]I have listened to a choir of countless voices, locked in eternal agony.
[35:28.56]This is one of the last areas in the game, by the way, if you're wondering.
[35:31.74]Sorry to spoil you.
[35:33.26]What spreads before me is not a living hell, but a dying, if not already dead, world.
[35:42.99]Are the demonic contracts the last purpose of this ancient and incomprehensible world?
[35:49.81]Good old Scythe!
[35:50.79]Brought me where I desired to be.
[35:53.37]As close to the Pact Holder as possible.
[35:59.65]Why can't I figure this out?
[36:01.89]There's like a video of showing someone, like, oh, here's, like, the Cauldron of Chaos preview, and it just shows someone, like, clicking on it and going there.
[36:08.87]Wait, we can't do that?
[36:13.91]Hold on.
[36:18.19]Ooh, so pretty.
[36:20.05]Yeah, this area.
[36:20.61]This is actually one of the cooler areas in the game, when it's only just one place.
[36:24.61]See you, chickens.
[36:25.36]Woo!
[36:25.74]Oh, they're fighting stuff.
[36:33.96]The chickens.
[36:36.14]Apparently, you have to either restart Steam itself, like, close Steam.
[36:42.34]What?
[36:43.01]What?
[36:43.87]You should, like, or you have to verify your game cache.
[36:47.42]Oh.
[36:48.62]Well, can you confirm that that works before I do it?
[36:51.34]Yeah, I'm doing it right now.
[36:58.33]Clicking on the update opened the game.
[37:00.37]I would have assumed that would also put it in the game.
[37:03.75]Yeah.
[37:04.67]Well, we're assuming a lot of things here.
[37:17.18]I hope you like the sound of chickens, everybody.
[37:19.64]Yeah, I hope you like the sound of chickens, because you're going to be hearing it for a while.
[37:23.38]Oh, that's the same voice actor as Geralt, by the way, from The Witcher.
[37:31.41]Interestingly enough.
[37:32.69]Is this Victor Fran?
[37:34.13]Wow.
[37:35.07]Victor Fran is Geralt from The Witcher.
[37:37.25]Hot post on Reddit.
[37:46.76]Oh, he's in the side.
[37:48.08]No, no, no, no, no!
[37:49.16]Not me!
[37:49.62]Not me!
[37:50.26]Not me!
[37:50.98]No!
[37:52.12]Not me!
[37:54.54]They're sick of the chickens, too.
[37:59.58]Let's try the other gun.
[38:00.84]The gun?
[38:01.48]Let's try the other gun!
[38:03.20]It's his side.
[38:04.14]His side?
[38:04.74]Let me put on the other gun!
[38:06.58]I love gun blades.
[38:12.11]Gun blades.
[38:15.14]My favorite gunblade is the one named after a cute boy.
[38:18.60]What are you talking about?
[38:20.80]There's apparently a secret I didn't get in here.
[38:26.21]There is a secret that I do not have in here.
[38:29.17]And, by golly, I need to find it.
[38:31.09]This is scary gargoyles.
[38:37.52]This is gargoyles.
[38:38.48]I just threw that in the absolute wrong direction.
[38:45.59]Holy balls.
[38:48.31]They're so easy to animate.
[38:55.41]Verifying my game cache has not done anything.
[38:59.05]Your starting steam has not done anything.
[39:01.74]Did I just get something?
[39:02.38]I feel like I just got something.
[39:08.38]Maybe it's chickens.
[39:10.56]I don't know.
[39:10.98]The chickens are infiltrating my brain.
[39:14.76]I'm hearing them when you're not shooting it.
[39:19.40]You're going to lay in bed tonight, Jero, and just hear the chickens.
[39:22.26]That actually happened when we played this game all day for two or three days straight.
[39:27.13]It was just like... I got this chicken gun crazy early on.
[39:32.33]It was really super overpowered when I got it.
[39:35.65]So I've been using it.
[39:37.29]And it's still the most powerful weapon I have.
[39:40.85]I don't think we can get up there.
[39:42.63]What?
[39:43.17]Oh, here's a little boss.
[39:47.30]Ooh, a treasure.
[39:49.62]A new secret.
[39:52.38]Oh, I'm slowed.
[39:54.12]Oh, the ring's underground.
[39:55.00]You're supposed to jump over them.
[39:57.14]No, I can stay in.
[39:58.80]And the melee DPS doesn't ever quit.
[40:00.70]Ah, bubbles.
[40:06.40]This is a very difficult to solve problem.
[40:08.86]Slay Seth.
[40:10.00]Apparently there's a mini-boss in here.
[40:11.98]Seth.
[40:12.74]Is this DLC real?
[40:13.96]Did they just make it up?
[40:16.58]Should be real.
[40:19.12]Hey!
[40:19.50]Our game is DLC!
[40:21.74]Actually, they've updated this game quite a bit.
[40:24.93]I read an article today about how if you say that your game has super advanced AI and super cool features, people have more fun playing it.
[40:33.84]Like, even if it doesn't.
[40:34.78]If you say the game is super cool, people will play it and like it more?
[40:39.44]Yeah!
[40:40.68]They had, like... They had two... They had people play Don't Starve twice.
[40:45.62]And for one of them, they're like, oh, this is just the game.
[40:48.38]The AI is random.
[40:49.32]It doesn't do anything special.
[40:50.32]And then they're like, oh, this is the cool new AI.
[40:53.14]It adapts the game to your play style.
[40:55.40]And then, like, when they told people that, they're like, oh, yeah, it did.
[40:58.72]It totally did.
[40:59.38]I mean, it was so much better.
[41:00.65]Wow, you did a really cool thing.
[41:02.90]power of the spoken word.
[41:04.80]Yeah, but it was just the same game, but they thought it was cooler.
[41:07.86]It's the same game, Ed.
[41:10.60]Come on, do it, whirlwind!
[41:12.72]You're just spinning in place.
[41:14.70]I was trying to make him do the whirlwind by simulating.
[41:17.17]I figured it out, and this is really, really broken, and I don't understand why.
[41:22.29]Yeah.
[41:24.91]You know how when you have, like, DLC in a game, you...
[41:29.56]like, in the Steam page, it shows, like, oh, here, you're gonna play this game, and it has, like, checkmark, checkmark, this is installed.
[41:36.56]Right.
[41:38.16]You're not gonna have any of those things for Victor Rand.
[41:41.60]You need to open the game on each free DLC from the store page of the DLC.
[41:46.83]That's what I... Yeah, and then Steam starts downloading.
[41:51.61]You should not have to do that.
[41:52.85]So, alright, well, after we do this... What do we do?
[41:56.85]We have to find Seth.
[41:57.97]Is this Seth?
[41:58.75]No, it's not.
[42:01.49]And that's why you haven't found any tombs either.
[42:04.13]Because they're not in your game.
[42:07.56]Really?
[42:07.76]Okay.
[42:17.59]I want to get a book.
[42:18.99]There's no books, right?
[42:20.11]You haven't done that either?
[42:20.97]Is that what you're saying?
[42:22.06]Yeah.
[42:23.24]Jeez, okay.
[42:23.96]When you go to your page on Steam, like, oh, I'm going to launch Victor Brand, it needs to say, it needs to show the DLC and have the check marks that it's installed.
[42:33.33]And the only way I got it to do that was by launching the game from the DLC page.
[42:43.30]This is one of the bosses.
[42:45.28]Curious.
[42:46.52]Wally.
[42:48.46]Wally.
[42:54.08]No, a solicitor?
[42:55.36]Like a sailor?
[42:56.12]One, two, one, two.
[42:57.90]I just got, like, zoned out right there.
[42:59.60]Is this?
[43:00.26]No, it is not.
[43:01.24]Where'd he go?
[43:05.66]Oh.
[43:05.78]He keeps smell-a-potting around.
[43:07.61]Smell this!
[43:25.23]Why is he purple now?
[43:28.13]Because, um... Yeah, I get to take out the adds.
[43:35.36]I guess I'll sit here and wait here with all my new content.
[43:37.84]Well, we're just gonna... Ooh, almost died.
[43:39.32]We're in a boss fight.
[43:40.64]We're fighting Wali.
[43:41.90]I know, we're just... Let us go.
[43:44.22]I'm just over here trying out the tomes.
[43:48.10]Ooh, that sounds fun, though.
[43:49.90]Ah!
[43:50.38]He's almost done.
[43:50.98]We just have to get rid of his shield.
[43:55.77]Oh shit, I keep forgetting actually, you're like 10 levels under leveled.
[43:58.91]Yeah.
[43:59.79]Crap.
[44:00.93]I did that.
[44:01.51]Did they have enrage timers?
[44:04.43]Huh?
[44:07.23]This item is actually really cool.
[44:09.40]The new tome?
[44:12.24]Stop luring me!
[44:12.96]There's a carpet attack.
[44:15.16]Carpet?
[44:16.52]There's a magic carpet attack.
[44:18.70]Whoa!
[44:19.10]Okay, that's- I need to see it.
[44:20.24]I have to get that.
[44:22.96]Did he just respawn that?
[44:24.62]God, I love Aladdin.
[44:25.58]I need this.
[44:27.14]I also look like a fucking moron holding a book in, like, my adventurer's outfit.
[44:32.61]I'm like Indiana Jones reading a novel.
[44:38.03]Oh, jeez, that hurts a lot.
[44:40.13]Has anybody played Brink?
[44:43.80]Oh, yikes!
[44:47.62]Yeah, that would've been bad.
[44:49.70]Oh!
[44:50.22]Shh, fuck.
[44:52.22]Oh!
[44:52.76]Boomerang!
[44:55.46]Nobody played Brink.
[44:59.39]I actually never played Brink.
[45:01.79]Didn't you?
[45:02.81]No.
[45:03.01]It was a thing that I never did.
[45:10.04]Why don't you feel safe?
[45:11.94]No, I actually wish I played it.
[45:14.72]I wish I was parkouring around.
[45:15.84]Yeah, Tome is really good.
[45:21.77]Dammit, gotta get rid of the elemental lords.
[45:27.06]Yeah, hold on.
[45:27.54]Maybe we got some elemental lords over here.
[45:29.88]Oh yeah, Starhawk.
[45:30.78]We're gonna have to give you a few.
[45:32.44]We got some elemental lords over here.
[45:34.30]Yeah.
[45:35.30]You know.
[45:35.86]You know how that goes.
[45:36.99]I wonder if I can come into your game with this.
[45:40.25]Try.
[45:41.13]I don't know.
[45:43.19]Maybe.
[45:43.57]Isn't our game technically your game that you made?
[45:45.53]I can't join you after being invited.
[45:49.19]Well, he's almost dead.
[45:52.43]Is he?
[45:52.69]I thought he was almost dead like half an hour ago.
[45:55.25]Look, his health is getting down.
[45:58.07]I'm just gonna destroy these spiders.
[46:00.65]Where'd he go?
[46:02.03]There he is.
[46:04.13]Spider's weakness is chickens.
[46:06.45]I don't know the stats of your chicken gun.
[46:13.22]This is better than mine.
[46:15.80]What are the stats of your chicken gun?
[46:17.52]There we go, now we can hurry.
[46:18.56]Well, I can't check right now.
[46:19.72]The solicitor can fool me right now.
[46:21.60]Check your stats on that gun.
[46:33.68]jumping this much.
[46:34.79]It actually doesn't do anything.
[46:37.51]Die!
[46:38.87]I think I'm used to with TF2.
[46:42.33]He's dead.
[46:44.83]He's dead.
[46:45.56]He's dead.
[46:46.26]He's dead.
[46:47.72]He's got Elemental Lord.
[46:50.08]Shit, we do.
[46:51.30]Good call.
[46:58.23]Potion, please!
[47:01.03]Wait!
[47:02.27]Aw, I got my red thing.
[47:03.61]I'm going away.
[47:05.25]Hey!
[47:05.49]He just died.
[47:06.07]The only reason why we did that is because he dropped stuff.
[47:08.75]And he dropped a lot of stuff.
[47:14.34]Chickens are very inaccurate.
[47:16.22]By the way.
[47:16.74]Oh, I just got a legendary.
[47:17.68]I got two legendaries right there.
[47:18.66]I don't even know what the hell it was.
[47:19.56]I just picked it up, though.
[47:20.46]What?
[47:23.09]What was that?
[47:25.55]I just got the same... God damn it.
[47:28.51]I got the item that I'm currently holding in my hand.
[47:32.42]I didn't get any legendary at all.
[47:35.84]I just died on something.
[47:37.60]At least I got a gift box.
[47:39.74]Oh, you died?
[47:41.78]There was like a puddle of pee on the floor and I put my little toe in it.
[47:45.37]You stepped on the poison pee.
[47:48.81]Yeah, I just picked up the uh... That's an item that I already have.
[47:55.38]There it is.
[47:55.92]Is it better than I already have?
[47:56.76]I'm just over here with all this new content.
[48:00.70]No.
[48:01.12]Yeah.
[48:01.44]Too bad.
[48:02.74]Alright.
[48:03.20]I need to... I'm gonna update my game.
[48:05.95]I'll be right back.
[48:06.63]Okay.
[48:10.57]Walk in with us now.
[48:15.03]What do we do?
[48:17.53]You need to go.
[48:19.07]Close the game.
[48:19.93]Exit your video game.
[48:21.61]Close my video game.
[48:23.45]And then you need to go to Steve, right?
[48:26.63]Go to where Victor Vran is, go to properties or DLC or something, right?
[48:30.61]Isn't it something like that?
[48:32.01]Properties?
[48:32.69]Let's see.
[48:33.42]No, I go to, in the library where Victor Vran is, you click on store page and then you can go to the DLCs.
[48:42.66]You can click them down there and you have to launch the game from the DLC page.
[48:50.75]For me, I don't know if there's an easier way to do it, but I don't know why it hasn't been done already.
[48:55.81]Cauldron of Chaos?
[48:58.33]Probably because it's listed as DLC instead of just an updated version of the game.
[49:04.25]When we first initially bought this, did we buy a different version or something?
[49:10.60]Are they selling this version or no?
[49:14.50]Selling what version?
[49:15.28]It's free.
[49:17.67]I don't know.
[49:18.31]So why would you have to launch it from this menu?
[49:20.17]I don't know, Trevor.
[49:21.38]I don't know.
[49:22.42]You're supposed to have all the answers.
[49:25.08]I am the answer.
[49:26.48]Alright, well, just... Okay, I launched it from... Okay, yep.
[49:32.48]I hope not.
[49:34.38]Do you have a game open?
[49:35.83]I have a game open.
[49:37.45]Sir?
[49:39.03]Do you have all three of them?
[49:39.97]Did it show all three check marks?
[49:42.16]Because I had to launch my game three times, I did not have a fun experience.
[49:45.88]What do you mean, checkmark square?
[49:50.73]I just opened up Cauldron of Chaos DLC, and it was like, you have done Cauldron of Chaos, and I'm in Cauldron of Chaos DLC.
[49:55.79]Okay, okay, close the game.
[49:57.97]Again.
[49:59.55]go to your Victor brand when you're going to launch the game and scroll down where it says DLC and see if you have all three installed and check marked.
[50:07.38]I do not.
[50:08.60]Yes, you have to launch the game three separate times from each DLC page.
[50:12.85]What?
[50:13.15]What the hell?
[50:14.21]Do I need the Highlander outfit?
[50:18.31]Yeah, I think we probably have to just to be on the same version, right?
[50:23.10]I don't I have no idea yeah I see what you know yeah like why would why would the outfit like highlander outfit why is that DLC and not just like a patch existing game I don't know because it's free anyway why is it why is it done this way I don't get it highlander outfit okay dope there it is okay
[50:49.05]Okay, I have it all.
[50:50.73]Modern gaming, everybody.
[50:52.33]I've never heard of that ever happening.
[50:55.64]That's weird.
[50:57.22]So now should I just launch the game normally?
[50:59.54]Yeah.
[51:01.00]As long as you have those three check marks on you.
[51:03.20]It says installed, installed, installed.
[51:08.21]Okay.
[51:10.43]I am ready to join somebody's video game.
[51:16.51]Hey, I launched the game from all three of those.
[51:19.17]Where's the checklist thing?
[51:20.61]I have to explain this like four times.
[51:25.00]Okay, okay.
[51:25.54]I got it.
[51:25.92]I found it.
[51:26.30]I found it, bro.
[51:30.12]Go ahead.
[51:31.46]Okay.
[51:32.02]Hello, everybody.
[51:33.22]We're back.
[51:35.68]I don't know this about Star, but he hates answering questions.
[51:38.45]I hate answering the same question like four times.
[51:41.82]I think it's any question.
[51:42.98]I explained it while you guys were playing and didn't want to come play with me.
[51:46.86]Well, we were doing something else.
[51:48.44]We were busy.
[51:49.12]I'm currently transmuting, alright?
[51:50.70]We had elemental lords crammed all in our business.
[51:53.58]So what I'm doing here is you can take three yellow items and there's a chance when you transmute them together, it'll make a purple.
[52:02.22]So I'm just getting rid of all my yellows because I don't really need them anymore.
[52:05.03]I have a purple.
[52:07.35]Try to get a purple.
[52:09.35]You know.
[52:12.86]Whoa, what is that?
[52:13.76]Oh, I got a book.
[52:15.10]I got a book.
[52:16.04]Oh, that's a book?
[52:16.96]You can buy the books from the dude over here if you're desperate.
[52:20.08]Yeah, I guess you could.
[52:21.60]What book?
[52:22.10]Or what guy?
[52:23.80]The guy that I was shooting at.
[52:29.26]There is no guy standing there on my screen.
[52:33.11]I wish you could train us to be together, legendaries.
[52:35.81]There's nobody here.
[52:38.80]There's a part in the campaign where they go away and you have to keep playing the campaign to get them back.
[52:43.84]Yep, that's what I was talking about.
[52:46.77]What you're talking about is that you are level 38 and you haven't played the game.
[52:50.33]Okay.
[52:51.83]Okay, guys.
[52:52.45]It shouldn't matter.
[52:53.23]It shouldn't be like that.
[52:54.05]Okay.
[52:54.57]It shouldn't work like that.
[52:56.37]I don't understand.
[52:57.87]We shouldn't be fighting in this.
[53:00.41]This is my stream.
[53:01.69]I don't want to hear a fight breakout.
[53:03.86]Are you gonna stop the car, Jerma?
[53:05.00]You better not stop the car.
[53:06.22]I'm gonna pull over and I'm gonna turn around and start screaming.
[53:10.74]We also have a bounty so we can actually have to find the Highlander outfit.
[53:13.89]I don't know what it does.
[53:14.65]And I don't remember how to even activate bounties.
[53:19.67]I don't know if it activated already.
[53:20.95]I bet it looks swag is what it does.
[53:22.98]Did activate.
[53:26.44]I'm gonna go look and see what it does.
[53:28.26]No, I wanna use that.
[53:35.03]Where's my rainbow?
[53:36.21]There it is.
[53:36.55]You could automate this stupid transmuting thing.
[53:39.29]It takes so long.
[53:40.95]Yeah, I wish it was automated as well.
[53:44.29]Want to see the magic carpet?
[53:46.65]I do.
[53:47.17]Where?
[53:47.71]I do.
[53:48.61]Armor penetration.
[53:49.45]We'll do this.
[53:50.75]I'll put that on.
[53:51.43]So this is a wraith here.
[53:54.45]It goes like this.
[53:55.17]It's pretty cool.
[54:01.29]So I need to take off all these cards.
[54:03.68]I guess I can try to explain the card system a little bit.
[54:07.54]So down here, see the destiny points right there are 16 out of 20.
[54:13.50]These all cost points and they all do different things.
[54:17.78]So for instance, like the archer card is five points and I get plus 20% range damage when it's on.
[54:24.23]You can combine these.
[54:25.51]These are like kind of the end game ones because we've been playing for a while, obviously.
[54:30.83]There are legendary versions of some of these cards.
[54:34.11]But this is a terrible setup if I'm going to be using a melee weapon because obviously it's built around doing like a ton of range damage.
[54:43.42]So let's just do like just a default build, I guess.
[54:53.81]Okay.
[54:56.73]I forget what all these do.
[54:58.38]I do know there's a small... Didn't you say the Swashbuckler was a terrible card?
[55:03.90]I think what I said was the Swashbuckler is the best card in the whole game.
[55:06.94]That's the one I think it is.
[55:08.50]Gain quickness for two seconds.
[55:10.52]No, that one's terrible.
[55:11.28]That's one of the worst cards in the game.
[55:14.28]Ooh, I crafted a Meteor.
[55:16.85]That's different.
[55:17.97]I'm going to put on the Rogue.
[55:21.25]100% critical damage.
[55:22.17]That sounds pretty cool for a melee person.
[55:25.97]Bam!
[55:27.82]10% crit chance.
[55:28.90]That also sounds pretty good if you're going to do crit man.
[55:33.32]Dude, a meteor falls from the sky and helps me kill stuff.
[55:37.32]Alright, I have 200% more crit damage.
[55:39.68]If you're committing to crit guy, there's one of the armor sets that gives a chance to crit.
[55:43.86]Yeah, I gotta look at that.
[55:46.47]Guys, the chat is getting bored of us sitting in here.
[55:48.95]I can feel it.
[55:50.51]Well, I mean, we're just kind of crafting stuff.
[55:53.25]No, I've been waiting to play for at least 15 minutes.
[55:56.39]Starry's been waiting to play for at least 15 minutes.
[55:59.15]Oh, he has not.
[56:00.91]I have.
[56:01.63]I installed the DLC and have been waiting to go to the new area.
[56:04.31]Alright, I have a ton of crit damage.
[56:10.27]I don't think I even have that outfit.
[56:20.05]I'm ready.
[56:20.39]You're not, you're level 38.
[56:23.73]I'm ready!
[56:24.65]Alright, well I'm just gonna go with it.
[56:27.93]Let's do it.
[56:29.11]Alright, we can actually play the DLC now, that's good.
[56:31.72]We shouldn't be level-shaming you guys.
[56:34.30]People can't control their levels, alright?
[56:36.52]No, I actually see the bounties you're talking about now.
[56:39.96]And the Cauldron of Chaos!
[56:42.12]Shall we go to the Cauldron of Chaos?
[56:45.21]What hex?
[56:45.95]Whoops.
[56:47.17]I did not mean to go to the Cauldron of Chaos.
[56:48.95]I meant to activate the hexes.
[56:51.23]Oh my god!
[56:52.87]I think there's a start point that I... Hold on.
[56:56.86]Just leave and come back.
[56:57.84]We haven't even done it.
[57:00.18]Overkill Mickey three lives without dying with Hex of Time.
[57:04.92]Slay Soul of Black with a Demon Power without dying.
[57:09.98]Gotta kill somebody with a scythe there.
[57:13.53]How do you activate... These are all pretty difficult.
[57:19.71]One of them is just all five hexes.
[57:21.81]Mine doesn't tell me which hexes I even need.
[57:24.42]It just says... Oh, wait, no, it does.
[57:27.98]So, let's just go with the one for five, because I don't think we're going to be able to do half of this shit with all five on.
[57:34.80]So, let's try to get all the chromatic aspects first.
[57:38.91]Destroy the chromatic aspects, is that what you're telling me?
[57:42.51]Yeah.
[57:43.37]And then there's also one without dying with five hexes, so try not to die, I guess.
[57:49.35]We'll stick to the wall.
[57:50.55]Okay, let's not die and let's kill things.
[57:52.37]Don't die and kill all five of the aspects.
[57:54.66]Here we go.
[57:59.42]If you don't complete every single one of those challenges on your first try, I'm unfollowing.
[58:03.68]Well, we're not going to do the scythe one because I'm not using a freaking scythe.
[58:08.69]Here we go.
[58:10.22]Are you?
[58:11.30]No.
[58:11.56]I'm using a rapier.
[58:13.61]Slay Durangatan.
[58:16.51]Wait, no.
[58:17.35]Which one was it?
[58:18.29]Hatred and angst with a sight.
[58:20.39]I'm not doing that.
[58:22.41]Well, let's just go.
[58:22.93]Let's just go.
[58:30.12]These guys are very dangerous.
[58:31.92]Ow.
[58:35.24]Oh, God.
[58:35.56]There's, um, nests.
[58:37.38]There are a lot of things everywhere.
[58:40.80]There's so many people on the screen!
[58:42.92]Oh my god!
[58:45.11]What is this?!
[58:49.25]It's like Fajardo!
[58:51.63]Level 38 also.
[58:53.17]Level change!
[58:54.83]Whoa!
[58:57.94]What is- I don't even know what's happening.
[58:59.20]I'm dead.
[59:00.22]Pretty hardcore.
[59:06.26]Okay, it wasn't just me.
[59:07.94]Whoa!
[59:08.22]This is what happens when you put all five hexes on.
[59:12.36]And go to the end game DLC area.
[59:15.40]Oh, there's like a random hex that just like shoots you with damage from the sky.
[59:20.70]Maybe I can't even endure that at this level.
[59:24.28]It's like my- shooting my chicken gun heals me.
[59:29.69]Oh, jeez.
[59:32.35]This thing, this orb of destruction following me is really, really giving me a pain in my rectum.
[59:39.69]Don't worry about your rectum!
[59:41.45]I've always got to worry about your rectum, are you serious?
[59:44.79]Oh yeah, didn't I tell you you had the best sword in the game last time we played Jerma?
[59:49.84]Okay, I remember.
[59:52.68]You're an annoying mutant.
[59:54.00]Shut your face.
[59:56.18]Because it's really good right here.
[59:58.87]You see when I hit everything on the screen and it stuns everything?
[60:01.53]You had that sword.
[60:04.67]That's right.
[60:06.11]Do I still have it though?
[60:07.11]That's a question.
[60:09.91]That's not when your thing got deleted.
[60:11.29]Those chickens are really annoying.
[60:14.33]Hey, I'm not the one with the chicken gun.
[60:18.33]I don't see chickens off screen, just for you.
[60:24.39]These things are still spawning like a million spiders a second.
[60:28.28]I had full health and I'm dead and I don't know what happened.
[60:30.04]Yes!
[60:30.78]Yes!
[60:33.64]Yes!
[60:33.82]Now you're killing it!
[60:34.70]I just insta-died.
[60:35.95]I'm like in my menu.
[60:38.63]Can we restart the area?
[60:39.65]Let's hold on to that.
[60:40.35]Let me get that item.
[60:41.41]If I remember where it is.
[60:42.67]Slay the Argoton.
[60:46.25]Ooh, there's stuff.
[60:47.55]Do I still have that item?
[60:48.59]Maybe it's in my stash.
[60:50.90]I'm gonna look in my stash.
[60:54.88]Oh wait, we're going back, right?
[60:57.83]I think so.
[60:59.11]We're not?
[61:00.77]Let me see if it's in my stash.
[61:08.19]Don't think I have that item.
[61:11.13]Strangely enough.
[61:12.34]It's a sword that's like purple with three links in it.
[61:16.72]Isn't that this one?
[61:20.58]I am playing melting right now.
[61:25.60]Oh, no, yeah, here it is.
[61:27.55]Shackles, right?
[61:28.17]That's what it's called?
[61:29.03]Yeah.
[61:30.03]Hey, Flutter, how you doing?
[61:30.95]It's the best sword in the game.
[61:32.43]What great gameplay.
[61:33.95]Oh, best weapon in the game.
[61:35.05]Alright.
[61:38.62]Shall we try this again with all five hexes again?
[61:41.14]I am fighting them currently.
[61:42.28]You're currently in there.
[61:43.06]I'm coming in.
[61:48.51]There are yellow orbs that are the same yellow as the floor.
[61:51.07]Yeah, make sure with the sword you do two attacks and then you do the B. And then it'll stun everything.
[61:57.41]Yep, that's the one.
[61:58.21]I have to equip my scythe right now.
[62:01.25]No time!
[62:02.09]You're taking so much damage.
[62:05.56]Jeez.
[62:11.82]Oh my goodness gracious.
[62:14.71]These things really hurt.
[62:16.79]What is spawning all the spiders?
[62:18.33]We gotta get rid of that thing first, probably.
[62:20.84]What is spawning all the spiders?
[62:22.10]Are you serious?
[62:22.72]Are you really just coming to that conclusion?
[62:24.98]No, no, I'm just saying, like, it's this thing over here.
[62:28.18]What the fuck?
[62:28.86]There's multiple things over there.
[62:31.37]What's going on right now?
[62:33.15]I think I reset the level.
[62:35.47]I noticed you, Reva, but they keep talking, so I can't do shoutouts to my channel.
[62:47.35]Ow.
[62:52.18]Ow.
[62:55.98]No!
[62:56.72]No!
[62:59.70]Maybe we should turn off some of the hexes and try to, like, do it normally.
[63:04.39]Potentially.
[63:06.09]I'm sure you can move and attack faster.
[63:08.71]I feel like I could do this.
[63:09.81]I'm sure you can get 120 armor.
[63:11.77]Victor Brand loses health.
[63:13.75]We are victimized.
[63:15.55]Hunters hit for 50% more damage.
[63:18.87]That hurts.
[63:23.48]Yeah, I'm getting instantly killed.
[63:25.36]Like, instantly.
[63:27.20]Okay, here's the new plan.
[63:29.08]You guys, like, go to town and, like, get something to eat, and I'll, like, do it.
[63:32.92]Wait, I clicked on the go to town button because you said that.
[63:37.90]It's because having three people here is making it harder, and one of them is... I don't want to level shame anyone.
[63:46.23]Oh, I keep forgetting that you're like 12 levels too low for this.
[63:51.21]Shit.
[63:51.93]You guys are dying just as much as me.
[63:54.37]I am definitely not.
[63:57.22]Oh, I definitely am.
[63:59.22]I am definitely dying a lot.
[64:02.43]Oh boy.
[64:10.73]Alright, I want to move that.
[64:15.27]Progress.
[64:18.63]Jesus.
[64:20.24]I'm not shooting the spawners, how about that.
[64:26.44]There's like nobody here!
[64:28.98]Where are you people?
[64:32.47]on the map.
[64:34.91]Don't believe it.
[64:35.87]Oh shit, there's a legendary there.
[64:38.65]Jeremy, focus!
[64:39.35]I am focused.
[64:43.27]You're standing next to a spawner that was spawning spiders the whole time.
[64:47.11]I was dead for the last 20 seconds.
[64:49.62]Oh!
[64:50.80]You just looked like you were standing there in my circle.
[64:53.62]Just like chilling out, having a cigarette.
[64:56.74]Hey, smoking's bad.
[64:58.98]No smoking.
[65:00.48]Marshmallow.
[65:07.42]This is a really great death screen.
[65:09.68]Can anyone look at the monster slain at the top left?
[65:13.22]No.
[65:15.34]Could you briefly... Could anyone in the chat notice there's a monster slain tally at the top left?
[65:19.70]And could you read off what that's saying right now?
[65:21.84]Yeah, because you're the only one that can stay alive.
[65:23.86]How are you staying alive?
[65:25.86]How come you're not getting insta-one-shot by the thing that insta-one-shots you?
[65:29.56]As I'm playing the game.
[65:30.70]Giant columns of fire.
[65:34.83]Beaming up from hell?
[65:36.29]No, because you're using a... You know what?
[65:37.77]Fuck this.
[65:38.33]I'm putting on my ranged weapon.
[65:39.57]That's why you're staying alive.
[65:40.59]You're shooting your gun.
[65:43.31]Okay.
[65:51.29]As long as I'm running 90% of the time.
[65:59.45]This is really fun, though.
[66:00.51]This is much better than the animal spit.
[66:05.05]That one was my fault.
[66:10.49]Ster and ash and ash and Ster and ash and Ster and Ster and ash.
[66:14.81]All these people don't know who you are, sir.
[66:22.82]Hey, look, I'm not going to learn real quick.
[66:26.10]What do you think about the invasion update?
[66:31.15]Oh, it's a great way to stay in shape.
[66:34.07]What?
[66:40.39]Dude, I just got like a normal-ass weapon.
[66:44.43]Like the lowest tier.
[66:45.39]Like this game is telling me something.
[66:47.25]I'm gonna put the cannon stuff back on.
[66:57.41]That was definitely much better.
[66:58.51]For this current situation.
[67:02.39]I'm sounding like a frickin' Naruto over here.
[67:13.51]Every one of these spiders is like a champion.
[67:17.13]Like they all went to war and came back.
[67:23.08]Now they're all fighting us.
[67:28.70]Chickens can't even hit them.
[67:32.48]Oh, my chicken's home!
[67:34.80]I've actually gotten a lot of legendary wounds from doing this.
[67:39.11]Not wounds, whatever the demon powers.
[67:42.23]Yeah, I got like three of them.
[67:46.01]Oh, you know, just critting for 3,000.
[67:47.61]Okay, I need to... I need to put on when we have a second here.
[67:55.96]I gotta retune my cards.
[68:00.06]There's like a second area.
[68:04.54]I mean, can someone just take a look at the top monster slain tally we got going on?
[68:09.16]Yeah, I'm going to actually start doing damage now.
[68:12.89]I had a terrible build, and I was dying instantly because I was meleeing people.
[68:16.33]Do you remember that hammer as well that pulls everything into one spot?
[68:20.00]I also really recommend that.
[68:21.64]You have, like, two of the best weapons, and you're not using them.
[68:24.70]I actually was using the other one.
[68:25.84]It just was too hard to not get instantly one-shot by the melee people.
[68:29.69]You don't have to actually hit anything with it.
[68:32.05]You don't have to swing at anything.
[68:33.13]I thought you talked about the sword.
[68:35.05]No, the sword, yeah.
[68:36.43]Two swipes, then you press B and everything gets stunned.
[68:38.60]That's all you need that sword for.
[68:40.84]Only switch to it when you have to be ready.
[68:42.22]I don't like those things happening to me.
[68:46.12]Come on, I need to earn some emotes.
[68:48.38]Where's the archer card?
[68:56.80]Defeat these.
[68:57.80]By bashing you?
[69:01.14]Alright.
[69:04.62]Oh!
[69:05.24]Pile of stuff.
[69:07.04]So area number two, huh?
[69:11.76]Ow!
[69:15.03]You guys using demon powers as well?
[69:16.97]Yes.
[69:17.59]I was.
[69:18.43]Should I not?
[69:20.89]Which way are we going?
[69:23.83]I was just trying to help.
[69:26.31]You can't actually go through there.
[69:27.86]You have to teleport.
[69:30.84]Souls of black.
[69:36.24]And the good boy's gone bad.
[69:39.96]There is a lot of things happening on my screen.
[69:42.03]Yes, there are a lot.
[69:45.09]Wow, this is a tiny corridor.
[69:56.00]Lazer!
[70:00.15]Why am I so slow?
[70:01.25]Oh, you can go in here.
[70:02.33]Wait, no you can't.
[70:08.61]Jerma?
[70:08.89]Where'd he go?
[70:09.79]Ashley has killed as many monsters as you.
[70:13.41]So?
[70:15.75]I just put on my, like, actual gear.
[70:21.58]I hate to be level shaming,
[70:24.87]Dude, I was dead for like 90% of what we just did, by the way.
[70:31.23]Wish we could have a different perspective on this game here.
[70:34.99]I do too.
[70:37.25]Teleport to player.
[70:41.80]Ow.
[70:45.62]Whoa.
[70:50.06]Again with the spiders.
[70:52.53]There are only five enemies in this game.
[70:55.65]Here's the exploding spiders.
[70:56.89]Don't stand near them.
[70:58.06]Get the nests.
[70:58.82]Fuck, I hate the exploding spiders!
[71:08.75]Yikes.
[71:11.05]Oh, the Dark Knight!
[71:11.97]I can't move him.
[71:20.97]Where are these meteors coming from?
[71:22.09]Is that you, sir?
[71:23.49]No.
[71:24.33]Nope.
[71:28.47]Ah, I'm stunned.
[71:30.04]Questions for wizards.
[71:31.08]Where are these meteors coming from?
[71:38.66]I guess the spider's blowing up.
[71:41.56]Oh.
[71:42.56]Oh!
[71:43.72]That thing hurt.
[71:44.72]There's a guy in the middle.
[71:46.21]We should probably kill him in the middle.
[71:47.83]Oh, we should be probably destroying the egg sacs on the sides.
[71:51.63]Where is it?
[71:53.05]Kill them all.
[71:53.83]Get everybody.
[71:57.39]Oh, that's hatred.
[71:58.15]So if you have a scythe, this is hatred and angst.
[72:02.44]Frickin' anime characters.
[72:04.76]Hatred and angst?
[72:06.16]Yeah.
[72:10.63]I'll see you in Death Note, dude.
[72:24.40]Oh, they explode!
[72:27.44]Where's the splurge?
[72:27.94]Is that running around?
[72:28.50]Just forgot that.
[72:31.86]There's another nest up top, for sure.
[72:34.56]Oh, dude.
[72:35.29]Oh, dude.
[72:35.85]Oh, dude.
[72:36.67]Oh, dude.
[72:39.77]Ah, dude.
[72:42.80]Yeah, there's a spider nest up top.
[72:44.84]Need help.
[72:46.65]From my friends.
[72:49.57]Hi, DJ Gadling.
[72:50.37]You're up top.
[72:51.27]He's really excited about catching a Jerma stream.
[72:53.21]Yes.
[72:55.11]This is the intense part of a Jerma stream, by the way.
[72:58.16]Whoa, yikes.
[73:03.20]You guys did just see that.
[73:05.20]I respawned and instantly died.
[73:07.98]Well, I didn't see it.
[73:09.40]Thanks for telling me.
[73:10.18]Just instantly.
[73:11.89]Come on, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
[73:13.25]Come on, how come you're not as good as my 40 hours played min-max character?
[73:19.47]I don't know.
[73:21.96]This is dumb.
[73:22.52]Hey, I had a really good character, but then the game deleted my fucking item.
[73:26.96]Can we stop hearing about your deleted item?
[73:29.20]No, it was so good.
[73:30.34]You've got like 4,000 items since then.
[73:31.66]It was so good.
[73:32.60]It was like the best item in the game.
[73:33.93]God, first world problem.
[73:46.12]Man, the video game deleted my inventory.
[73:53.01]I'm dead.
[73:54.61]Did you teleport away?
[73:59.35]Yeah, when you're dead in this game, you just kinda like sit down.
[74:01.49]No, you just kinda sit.
[74:02.35]You don't like do anything.
[74:03.27]You're just like, I'm just gonna sit here.
[74:05.13]I'm just gonna hang out.
[74:07.38]Just Victor Brandon it up.
[74:08.50]You know, a little me time.
[74:14.25]I wish he wouldn't be shooting at me.
[74:17.61]Although he shot at me.
[74:19.05]Yeah.
[74:19.63]I was at full health.
[74:20.85]We got him.
[74:22.77]Yeah, we did it.
[74:24.77]The tracker wants to hear more about your deleted item.
[74:27.03]Yeah, I was reading that.
[74:27.87]I really want to keep hearing about it.
[74:29.89]Which item was it that was deleted?
[74:32.32]The electricity ball one.
[74:34.20]Oh, really?
[74:34.92]Tell me about it.
[74:35.54]What does it do?
[74:36.96]Hey, you should know about it because we did a lot of cool shit with that item.
[74:41.90]Yeah, we actually did.
[74:42.68]That item is really cool.
[74:45.38]And then Jerma was like so bad at the game he got his item deleted.
[74:50.58]I was so bad at the game that I put it in my inventory and it deleted.
[74:53.18]There's a chest up there.
[74:56.06]There actually is.
[74:57.44]Fun time.
[74:58.80]I don't think you can get up there.
[74:59.82]Can we get up there that way?
[75:01.54]Hold on, let me hold shift and rotate my camera.
[75:03.82]I'll go over here.
[75:04.56]Other side.
[75:09.96]Oh wow.
[75:11.74]The lowest quality of rapier.
[75:15.32]What am I going to get?
[75:22.18]Money!
[75:25.10]And that's it.
[75:25.84]Money's like worthless at this point in the game.
[75:29.18]Even at level 37.
[75:31.40]It kind of is.
[75:32.56]No, it's really, really not.
[75:36.08]What's coming up?
[75:36.64]We need to go... Where do we need to go?
[75:41.78]This way?
[75:42.86]To the right.
[75:45.38]pointing right for some reason.
[75:46.62]Oh, let's kill spiders.
[75:48.16]There's an enemy in this game.
[75:50.32]There's a lot of spiders.
[75:52.68]I don't think I've killed enough spiders.
[75:58.21]My only problem.
[75:59.63]Can't go up there.
[76:00.23]Oh boy, too hard.
[76:20.21]Damn.
[76:20.35]Are these the dancers or are they just mocking me?
[76:23.85]I don't know.
[76:28.73]Shit.
[76:32.39]Where are these meteors coming from?
[76:33.59]I don't know.
[76:37.41]Vampire?
[76:39.35]From the vampire.
[76:40.84]Think about what you just said.
[76:42.40]From Vampire Man.
[76:45.51]He said it like it was obvious.
[76:47.71]Remember to open fill the skeletons if you can.
[76:51.51]What?
[76:52.57]I'll do it, how can I?
[76:53.39]Otherwise they reanimate.
[76:55.33]How does it feel to be as good as Jerma and ten levels lower than him?
[77:05.20]Wow, Whomp Ronnie.
[77:06.42]Well, here.
[77:07.38]If we're going to keep bringing up that, then I'm going to... If you keep bringing that up, I'm going to keep bringing up that I'm not using my item.
[77:13.45]Don't you know how that works?
[77:15.59]I don't think that's why, because Ashley isn't using that item either.
[77:18.03]She's using the chicken gun.
[77:19.01]The chicken gun's incredible.
[77:20.57]The chicken gun is not very good.
[77:22.05]Yes, it is.
[77:23.51]I've already gone to explain that you have two of the best items in the game.
[77:28.62]He's usually right about things.
[77:31.44]Easy, though.
[77:32.90]Yeah.
[77:33.96]Yeah.
[77:36.06]I play video games.
[77:49.79]Why?
[77:50.33]My chicken.
[78:06.14]That guy has a lot of health.
[78:07.94]Oh, by the way, it's also worth noting that you are pretty much killing every single enemy, by the way, because of your build.
[78:15.08]Okay, I like that.
[78:18.22]So, there's like... We're talking about last hits here.
[78:22.45]Yeah.
[78:23.51]Like, that's it.
[78:26.15]You're last hitting every single enemy.
[78:29.01]Me?
[78:29.91]Yeah.
[78:33.26]I'm also dealing, like, all the damage.
[78:35.38]That's worth something.
[78:37.52]All the damage?
[78:38.36]ALL the damage, huh?
[78:44.46]All of it?
[78:45.12]Every single bit of it?
[78:46.87]All of it.
[78:47.45]Oh, what was that?
[78:48.29]What's that do?
[78:48.81]I think those are the Demon's Souls.
[78:50.95]Oh.
[78:51.97]That's the end.
[78:52.45]Yep.
[78:53.27]Demon's Souls.
[78:55.57]So what do you do with these now?
[78:57.39]You can trade them, apparently, for legendary items.
[78:59.63]I don't know, maybe after we go in the portal?
[79:02.00]I don't know.
[79:03.32]Hello?
[79:03.50]Oh, this is another area.
[79:05.04]Oh.
[79:05.22]Alright.
[79:07.80]Time to fight the other enemy immediately.
[79:18.11]The balls.
[79:19.31]Oh, shit.
[79:19.69]Is this the guy that's gonna multiply every time you kill him?
[79:22.79]Probably.
[79:25.89]Oh, the plague rats.
[79:26.85]I hate these things.
[79:29.08]Jump, jump, jump!
[79:33.41]Oh yeah, it did say there was a unique boss fight at the end of all these, so I guess this is the boss we got.
[79:45.46]Whoa!
[79:47.04]What is that?
[79:47.84]Wow!
[79:48.74]You have to jump over that.
[79:50.38]That hurts.
[79:51.46]Ooh, there's a lot of them all of a sudden.
[79:53.74]Those purple crystal guys are by far the strongest in the game.
[79:56.36]Don't get hit by them.
[79:57.87]Oh no!
[79:58.85]They're so bad!
[79:59.37]That's my advice.
[80:03.07]That's the legendary color.
[80:04.75]I'm playing a pong ripoff.
[80:10.11]Playing chicken simulator.
[80:11.87]I've got fun being dead nude.
[80:16.77]Oh, ouch.
[80:20.87]Oh, we got a... I'm so dead.
[80:25.18]I'm so dead.
[80:25.88]I'm so dead.
[80:26.34]I'm so dead.
[80:35.29]And boom goes the dynamite.
[80:36.49]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[80:38.37]Meme reference.
[80:39.49]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[80:41.20]We get it, Jeremiah.
[80:42.16]You lost your item.
[80:43.16]God.
[80:44.34]I didn't say anything.
[80:46.74]We were thinking it.
[80:48.80]Hey, I've been thinking it since we started, okay?
[80:51.60]This whole time I've been like, where'd my fucking item go?
[80:58.96]Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[81:02.58]I'm running in circles around the room because I like... Oh shit, I'm dead.
[81:05.22]This camera's so hard to move.
[81:06.36]I can only really shoot from one direction.
[81:10.42]Oh yeah, I'm not playing with the controller.
[81:13.14]Are you guys both dead?
[81:14.38]No.
[81:15.02]I am.
[81:17.96]I died.
[81:18.99]I'm going to be because Jerma isn't being a meat shield.
[81:21.03]We get it, we get it, Jerma.
[81:22.23]You vape.
[81:23.81]Oh my god.
[81:25.77]You vape.
[81:27.19]Where are there like more of them?
[81:39.38]Fuck.
[81:40.98]If they were shooting, anyone else?
[81:46.67]Rat character from Australia.
[81:48.93]Don't remember that one in Overwatch.
[81:52.73]Junkrat from Australia.
[81:56.25]Jesus.
[81:58.43]I was picturing like a rat rat, like a rat rat.
[82:02.04]Not like a guy named Rat.
[82:04.06]His name is Junk.
[82:06.25]This guy wants to know how we met, Stark.
[82:08.92]The story of how we met.
[82:09.94]Craigslist.
[82:11.46]The story of how you deleted Jerma off your Craigslist.
[82:14.18]Yeah, yeah, we could tell that story.
[82:15.92]No, I don't want to tell that story right now.
[82:19.98]You don't like that story?
[82:21.62]I'd like to save that story for another day.
[82:24.86]Okay.
[82:25.10]Hey, it's up to you, man.
[82:32.31]I'm gonna tell the story and then pay Wallet.
[82:37.40]I gotta talk to, whoa.
[82:39.46]Is that Gaben?
[82:40.62]Oh my God.
[82:41.00]This is Gaben.
[82:42.46]You don't have enough Demon's Souls for this item?
[82:44.26]It's 70 Demon's Souls?
[82:45.82]Holy shit, that's so many.
[82:47.12]How many did we just get?
[82:48.59]I don't know, like two?
[82:51.37]Two.
[82:51.61]Did we really just get two?
[82:54.23]We got two Demon's Souls.
[82:58.27]The Nekonomicon?
[83:00.63]That's such a good item for a name.
[83:05.30]What is it, like a cat?
[83:06.54]These are new weapons too, I think.
[83:08.86]Is it new weapons?
[83:09.66]No, that's a chicken cannon.
[83:13.03]That's new, at least.
[83:14.51]I wish I had a guy standing there.
[83:16.57]Emote.
[83:18.81]Legendary die, lucky rabbit's foot.
[83:21.65]This is all really, really expensive.
[83:24.35]Do we have to do this dungeon like 60 more times?
[83:26.34]I guess.
[83:30.56]Well.
[83:32.76]Damn.
[83:35.11]Where do you see your orbs?
[83:36.89]How many do you have?
[83:37.89]They're in the skull inventory all the way to the right.
[83:40.97]The little red squirrely things.
[83:43.69]I have three.
[83:47.72]So for carrying you guys, I get one more orb.
[83:51.06]Pretty much.
[83:53.50]Let's do it again.
[83:57.74]Let's do that one more time.
[84:04.30]You need to mess with your cards, Jerma.
[84:06.06]Ah, give me a second.
[84:07.54]Jerma, you need to mess with your little cards.
[84:10.12]No, actually, not really.
[84:10.82]I just need to do... I threw this all together way too quickly.
[84:14.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[84:33.66]Where is No, I can't do that six times five
[85:04.84]It's 55, Jerma.
[85:05.94]And I'm just thinking about... Thinking inside my head.
[85:09.66]You think I was just sitting there going, what's six times five?
[85:13.26]It's actually 35, isn't it?
[85:23.80]It's 30.
[85:24.30]That's the meta of the joke.
[85:25.98]I think it's like... What was I doing?
[85:33.10]Oh, I remember...
[85:37.16]That crit is good.
[85:38.32]Wait.
[85:44.35]Alright, that's good.
[85:48.45]I think that's way too funny.
[85:51.83]What?
[85:52.88]You screaming, I know, god, and then it's like wrong.
[85:57.04]It's not, it was not good.
[86:00.50]Six times five is thirty.
[86:03.83]What are you talking about?
[86:13.20]I'm ready whenever you're ready.
[86:14.52]You know what I mean?
[86:15.82]Like, I was born ready.
[86:17.54]I have this loadout that I'm using right now.
[86:19.44]Look at this sword.
[86:21.30]I swing that, and then I go, pa-pa-pa.
[86:24.16]Now let me get the other item.
[86:25.88]The other extremely important item that I didn't have on.
[86:27.98]If I even still have that.
[86:34.82]Which one?
[86:36.06]The hammer that pulls everything in.
[86:37.32]I didn't, like, get rid of it.
[86:39.20]Okay, remember you can cancel the pull by jumping and it still pulls if you hold the pull long enough.
[86:43.28]Pull boy.
[86:44.10]Pull boy.
[86:45.09]And then it doesn't use your cooldown, but it still pulls.
[86:48.87]Glitch abuser.
[86:49.69]Glitch abuser.
[86:52.15]Well... I don't own that item, apparently.
[86:59.03]The giant ice hammer.
[87:00.80]Yep.
[87:07.04]Apparently I do not own that item.
[87:08.92]Tell us about that item that you lost.
[87:10.74]I don't know.
[87:15.60]Explain to us how you keep doing it.
[87:20.12]There was a bug where you'd put something in your inventory and then you'd lag out and the item would be gone.
[87:25.98]Maybe that's what happened.
[87:26.76]Because I don't have any hammers.
[87:30.42]Didn't I have like three or four hammers?
[87:33.67]You know you can sort, you press the star to sort.
[87:35.57]Legendaries will be at the top.
[87:37.79]It seems like you're really looking for them.
[87:39.91]I was going by hammer.
[87:43.41]No, apparently I don't have it anymore.
[87:45.53]Sort by rarity, it shows up there.
[87:47.07]I'm gonna flip out.
[87:54.94]I'm gonna flip out.
[87:56.98]Tell us about it.
[88:11.76]We'll do that.
[88:15.80]I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[88:16.78]Again.
[88:22.15]Okay.
[88:30.37]Alright.
[88:31.09]Let's do it.
[88:34.40]After she gets back, of course.
[88:36.84]I'm gone.
[88:38.34]What?
[88:39.32]I'm going.
[88:40.24]Don't go.
[88:40.62]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[88:41.54]I'm going.
[88:43.06]I'm in.
[88:43.86]Are you in?
[88:44.96]Yep.
[88:45.48]Are you seriously in?
[88:46.20]Come on.
[88:47.19]Yep.
[88:48.97]Mickey three lives.
[88:49.67]We have to overkill.
[88:50.45]Who's this guy in the start?
[89:01.17]Oh, I'm stuck.
[89:21.19]I was doing alright and I insta-died So that guy's be overkill Mickey three lives he's the guy who loves turning into the let me stomp on him before you try to you can do like a super crit, right?
[89:37.58]Yeah, I can do it if I get the shot.
[89:40.26]I need the shot.
[89:41.12]I'll take the shot.
[89:43.24]Once I get the stomp on this dude, is when you need to go for it.
[89:53.75]Alright, where is he?
[89:55.41]I don't know.
[89:58.33]It's so hard to tell.
[89:59.25]It's so hard to see where everybody is right now.
[90:01.04]I'm just trying to clean up the eggs first.
[90:03.74]Oh, the egg.
[90:06.64]Good job.
[90:07.95]That was a great joke, actually.
[90:17.12]Jeez.
[90:19.20]I went from 100% to 0%.
[90:19.94]Holy fucking hell.
[90:25.75]Last time, he was really hurt.
[90:28.74]Don't kill him, kill him.
[90:30.34]I just danced around.
[90:31.66]I did.
[90:32.18]Did you overkill him?
[90:34.62]I actually was going to kill him because she didn't know what was going on, so I tried and I did not overkill him.
[90:44.04]I just took, like, I just inhaled all that damage.
[90:46.80]That sucked.
[90:57.53]I heard a spider!
[91:03.15]Get away from me!
[91:04.74]Ah, they regenerate!
[91:05.72]No wonder I can't do any damage!
[91:07.36]Gotta focus!
[91:08.38]Ah!
[91:09.56]Alright, the spider nest is going down dead.
[91:19.42]There's one at the top right, and I think that's the last one.
[91:21.66]Got it.
[91:28.29]Eat chicken!
[91:30.64]Delicious!
[91:32.12]Kind of is.
[91:34.16]Oh, sesame chicken!
[91:35.42]Yes!
[91:40.20]Today was like hysterical.
[91:41.48]You want to get sesame chicken with me?
[91:42.64]And he was like, no.
[91:43.35]No.
[91:43.41]Shot down.
[91:43.73]Yes, I made it.
[91:44.79]I just did 10,000 damage to that guy.
[91:47.87]Almost 11,000 damage.
[91:50.15]Nope.
[91:58.19]Nope.
[91:58.81]You did.
[91:59.91]Nope.
[92:00.33]Check.
[92:01.11]Go ahead and do a little confirmation with the stream.
[92:02.97]Nope.
[92:08.57]I looked over at chat and there's just a lot of people saying wow Jerma, that's like 100 damage.
[92:11.41]People running around chasing me, maniacs!
[92:43.83]Why me?
[92:45.94]Why me?
[92:52.96]This is going a bit faster than the first time, at the very least.
[92:57.67]At least, huh?
[92:59.91]Can't tell really from when I was about to get him.
[93:03.15]You can actually hurt them while they're invisible.
[93:06.91]If you see their little cloud.
[93:08.34]Do you hurt their feelings?
[93:10.28]Yes.
[93:12.52]I mean, we know where to go.
[93:14.84]I guess we don't want to split up.
[93:17.52]Let's just go this way.
[93:22.76]Every time you go through a door, I have to go into my menu.
[93:25.52]Teleport here.
[93:26.16]Maybe that's because you're not high enough level.
[93:30.39]Yeah!
[93:31.59]Maybe it's really annoying.
[93:34.75]Maybe bad game design.
[93:40.35]Uh, I will not stand you talking bad about Victor Rant.
[93:43.15]Oh shit, what's going on with my body?
[93:45.23]Make sure you kill the egg sacs and remember they explode.
[93:52.07]No, he clicked on the window!
[93:57.99]I'm sure he'll be the death of me if I click on you instead.
[94:02.21]Egg sacs?
[94:04.33]Yep, yep, yep.
[94:05.95]Your fault, Fox.
[94:07.90]Your fault.
[94:08.44]Wow!
[94:09.10]Well, I got one of the egg sacs.
[94:14.86]You're actually killing things this time.
[94:17.60]Yes, I am.
[94:20.09]I appreciate it.
[94:20.81]I think it's because your build is the last hits.
[94:26.11]How good is this game?
[94:27.98]It's good.
[94:29.17]You don't know if you need to buy it?
[94:31.15]Um, I would definitely say yes, buy this game.
[94:34.03]What you're watching right now, you're watching, like, the ultra endgame.
[94:37.29]This is, like, the last possible thing.
[94:38.67]Can you say the word endgame one more time?
[94:41.94]Probably, like, the fourth time I've said it.
[94:45.36]At least seven.
[94:46.30]Somebody's fucking salty.
[94:48.40]You're triggering her.
[94:49.52]And she's dead, so she has nothing else to think about.
[94:51.48]I'm dead, too.
[94:52.66]Better respawn.
[94:53.44]You better protect me.
[94:54.34]Why would I?
[94:58.36]40 kills over there.
[94:58.88]Otherwise I'll complain.
[94:59.56]Everything will focus on me.
[95:04.90]Playing through the game normally, just like from start to finish without like all the hexes and stuff is a very enjoyable experience.
[95:09.94]Yeah, before the endgame.
[95:12.00]I didn't say it that time, you did.
[95:14.23]I know I did.
[95:18.91]Chronic trigger.
[95:21.21]I'm too busy dying here.
[95:23.85]See?
[95:23.99]You really complain about the endgame when you're dead.
[95:28.79]I do.
[95:29.09]I'm collecting a tail of spiders.
[95:33.41]For Halloween.
[95:34.31]For my Halloween casting.
[95:35.33]These eggs need rubber.
[95:41.67]Look at those eggs need... Is that a recipe you were trying to tell me?
[95:47.55]The first you take, the eggs need... There's too many spiders!
[95:56.93]There's two egg sacs over on the left that need to go down.
[96:01.65]Hiding behind the giant fucking gargoyle that's gonna kill me again because I can't move because he sucked magnetically to my body.
[96:11.27]That's so unfair!
[96:19.50]That I'm gonna complain about.
[96:23.10]Oh, you're supposed to say it.
[96:28.77]Oh, it's endgame content.
[96:30.27]Ah, endgame!
[96:31.11]We did it.
[96:35.79]Wish I had an emote so I could, like, make fun of you.
[96:37.90]But that's what we're here for.
[96:40.18]Where's the stuff on the ground?
[96:41.92]That's all I came for.
[96:42.88]Uh, where can we go now?
[96:47.88]Did we- last time, did we explore the whole area, or no?
[96:50.26]No, we did not.
[96:51.46]We luckily went right to the end.
[96:53.86]I'm fighting them!
[96:56.42]Well, you're very fast.
[97:00.58]Fine.
[97:00.96]Teleport.
[97:05.21]How do you teleport to somebody again?
[97:09.47]Go into your menu.
[97:10.85]Click online.
[97:12.57]Oh, it's in online.
[97:13.47]There it is.
[97:18.14]Let's do that roughly.
[97:20.74]For 45 seconds.
[97:22.48]Wow.
[97:22.90]I'm sick of hearing about it.
[97:23.94]Can you stop talking about it?
[97:25.00]Okay.
[97:32.66]I don't know.
[97:35.79]Spider.
[97:36.15]Spider.
[97:39.53]Look at the chat.
[97:42.21]I love you, Jerma.
[97:43.49]No homo.
[97:45.92]Jerma, I need a bedtime story.
[97:47.60]Go to bed or you're grounded.
[97:51.22]Don't scold my chat like that.
[97:53.26]I didn't scold anybody.
[97:54.68]I'm talking about him.
[97:55.50]He's like scolding somebody.
[97:59.05]Who's him?
[98:02.14]YouTube.com slash Ster.
[98:04.28]That's the guy.
[98:06.80]The person still wants a bedtime story.
[98:08.78]They've been saying that for like two hours now.
[98:12.14]I really want a bedtime story.
[98:14.86]Go to bed.
[98:15.94]Just go to sleep.
[98:25.64]Die, die, die, die, die.
[98:46.63]Wow.
[98:48.28]How are you ever gonna get the achievement for not dying?
[98:50.72]Never.
[98:53.06]Did that don't die achievement with these hexes on?
[98:55.96]Holy shit.
[98:57.69]That's gonna be very difficult.
[98:59.35]I've done it.
[99:01.49]You haven't died doing this?
[99:03.61]I haven't died yet.
[99:04.57]Last time I got one of them, but so I have to kill the end boss.
[99:07.61]I don't know if that is true about this time.
[99:10.57]No, I haven't died this time.
[99:11.45]Last time.
[99:12.17]Last time I died once here, and now I'm dead.
[99:17.19]You know, not to brag, but you know, I know I'm not allowed to talk about anything relating to the game while Ashley's here.
[99:22.38]Huh?
[99:27.04]Let's transmute some more.
[99:28.28]I wish this guy would stop disappearing.
[99:29.62]That'd be great.
[99:31.96]Stop throwing his hands everywhere.
[99:33.26]Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
[99:38.57]I was just being greedy and just wanted to die- just like stand next to him while I died.
[99:44.01]Ready?
[99:47.11]I'm not ready.
[99:49.19]Ready?
[99:51.27]I'm not ready.
[99:52.35]Do you see me kneeling? I'm currently doing a prayer.
[99:55.43]Oh.
[99:58.55]How's the grass looking buddy?
[99:59.67]Good.
[100:02.13]So we're going in this portal.
[100:06.05]Oh, we already did this one.
[100:08.88]This is the last guy.
[100:11.24]Oh, it can't, it's not... Is this a version of these guys?
[100:14.36]It's not going to split.
[100:17.20]Remember all the purple dude?
[100:18.86]You remember doing this?
[100:19.96]No, no, no.
[100:20.80]I thought you said that this was one of the final bosses.
[100:23.30]Isn't there more or something?
[100:24.76]No, this is the final boss of this family.
[100:39.26]Kill the purple guys as soon as you can.
[100:53.08]Nice one, Holy Necro.
[100:55.18]Ah!
[101:00.53]By the way, if you see people saying, kills you with determination, it's an Undertale reference.
[101:07.43]You're welcome.
[101:18.39]I jumped into them!
[101:23.81]These guys hurt a ridiculous amount for no reason.
[101:26.76]There's nothing else in the game that does as much damage as these guys.
[101:40.94]Pwn's greater than elemental?
[101:42.52]Hey Ultimate Skeleton, how did I know it was you?
[101:47.11]Alright, alright.
[101:47.67]They're gonna be vulnerable.
[101:48.56]Get them!
[101:53.84]I'm just injured by this.
[101:54.52]I thought you were using that hammer.
[101:56.60]I don't have it anymore for some reason.
[101:58.12]Oh, yeah.
[101:58.98]Oh, did the game delete it?
[102:00.66]No, I'm not allowed to say that in my own stream because Ashley will get upset about it.
[102:07.49]That's why I haven't said it.
[102:08.81]Because you're gonna get very fucking mad.
[102:10.31]I'm more upset about the other thing, okay?
[102:13.63]I'm not allowed to say anything in my own stream about stuff.
[102:16.94]You guys are both dead.
[102:18.48]I'm just gonna not fight them.
[102:20.00]Yeah, we're both dead.
[102:20.72]That's where the rage comes in.
[102:27.14]This is America.
[102:27.94]You can say anything you want.
[102:31.12]Hey, I'm free to refuse service.
[102:33.82]Like a restaurant.
[102:42.82]I'm going with a lob shot.
[102:43.89]Long range.
[102:46.39]Oh, you're converging on me.
[102:55.55]Damn.
[103:06.14]Oh, God.
[103:07.48]That's horrible.
[103:13.24]They're just shooting in every direction.
[103:15.24]Draw their fire, Dremel.
[103:20.07]Nope.
[103:20.55]You draw their fire, not me.
[103:22.01]Not me.
[103:22.95]Overkill, motherfucker!
[103:40.16]I did it.
[103:40.60]I didn't die.
[103:43.59]What'd you get?
[103:46.93]Two Demon's Souls.
[103:48.83]That's it.
[103:49.15]Two Demon's Souls.
[103:50.31]Now you just need 50 more.
[103:51.49]I think it was two.
[103:53.27]Does he only sell shit with, uh... Yeah, Demon's Souls?
[103:58.80]Yeah, I got two.
[104:00.02]Nothing.
[104:00.90]Nothing dropped at all.
[104:08.58]Hmm, well.
[104:11.89]I need fricking 70 of these things dude.
[104:14.61]You need to do this a lot of times.
[104:16.31]Is there anywhere else where these drop?
[104:17.49]Or is this like the only place where they drop?
[104:19.49]This is it.
[104:32.45]Two Demon's Souls equals Dark Souls 2 confirmed.
[104:34.53]It's coming out guys.
[104:39.20]Oh dude, Mickey three lives has three lives and you have to overkill each of them.
[104:45.08]Alright, so do you want to try to do this without the hexes so we can try to do the actual quests without these extremely difficult all five of these things turned on?
[105:00.46]Whatever you want to do because I already did the hard ones.
[105:05.13]Slay Soul of Black with a Demon Power without dying.
[105:11.49]All the ones that are left there, I can't really do.
[105:14.35]Because I'm not going to be able to kill it with a Demon Power, and I'm not going to use a Scythe.
[105:22.38]Well, what else was there?
[105:22.92]I don't really care.
[105:23.62]What else was in this update?
[105:24.82]Anything?
[105:27.42]The Tome and the Highlander outfit.
[105:30.01]I don't want to just put that on the sea.
[105:34.13]You have to do the quest to get it.
[105:39.67]Cool.
[105:42.13]Whoa!
[105:45.91]I'm gonna go to the Codex and see Codex.
[105:54.21]Fire short-range magical projectiles that pierce targets dealing damage.
[105:57.33]Hold the button to increase fire rate.
[105:59.12]Can you guys leave that area?
[106:01.00]Wait, you wanna go back in?
[106:02.42]Yeah.
[106:11.46]Okay, Codex.
[106:20.58]I wonder if you can get the, um, if that's, if there's more than one legendary book.
[106:24.67]There probably has to be, right?
[106:26.73]I'd imagine, I think everything had, I forget, we figured this out.
[106:31.91]Everything has at least three.
[106:33.45]Might be more than that.
[106:36.87]This seems pretty cool.
[106:41.26]That's a sweet top hat.
[106:43.30]Holy shit, this is easy without you guys here and with all the hexes off.
[106:47.14]With all the hexes off?
[106:48.32]Are you serious?
[106:49.79]And, like, not the difficulty scaling.
[106:53.17]Well, can I show up?
[106:54.37]Yeah.
[106:54.63]Alright.
[106:55.81]Have fun, baby.
[106:57.99]I'll put that on.
[107:18.19]Teleport to player.
[107:42.67]There actually are also a lot of drops here compared to other areas.
[107:47.00]Doing the Endless Dungeon, you don't get anything.
[108:15.79]I hate being slow.
[108:20.14]I hate it too!
[108:20.94]I love being slow baby.
[108:47.36]A lot of stuff does drop.
[108:48.36]I want a legendary book.
[108:51.22]By fire, be purged.
[108:59.27]What did I just get?
[109:00.07]Souls of Black.
[109:07.41]I already had all these.
[109:10.62]I probably should be experimenting more with those.
[109:38.93]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[109:46.19]Too bad Boo couldn't make it.
[109:47.19]Yeah, where's Boo?
[109:49.72]Boo, are you here?
[109:51.16]Say something if you're here.
[109:57.20]No, he's not here.
[109:57.98]What a crap joke.
[110:18.11]I got banned for asking Jerma if he's noticed any nice girls since he moved to his new place.
[110:23.25]I don't say things like that anymore.
[110:25.05]Wait, what?
[110:30.44]What the hell are you talking about?
[110:32.42]I read the line in chat.
[110:33.58]Somebody said this.
[110:35.66]Oh.
[110:35.84]I thought you were just saying that.
[110:37.22]I'm like, what?
[110:38.56]No!
[110:46.27]I hate being slow!
[110:49.17]It sucks.
[110:49.67]You've been slow your whole life, dude.
[110:54.77]Oh!
[110:56.19]You're saying good one to me?
[110:58.43]Good one to you, sir.
[111:02.88]You actually saw a sign today that said slow, I thought of you.
[111:09.59]It just said slow, and no one was going slow.
[111:12.17]Oh, tell another one!
[111:15.61]You masterful comedian!
[111:18.53]Um... You're dumb.
[111:28.43]I saw a sign that said zoo, and I thought of you, Gerbil.
[111:31.96]We didn't see that.
[111:32.84]That's not the truth.
[111:35.96]There's a picture of a zebra.
[111:38.42]The fiercest of all zoo animals.
[111:42.05]Zebra?
[111:43.51]Yep.
[111:44.99]Not fierce as in, like, it'll hurt you.
[111:47.09]Like, oh, that's so fierce.
[111:48.77]Fierce as in, like, Beyonce.
[111:51.97]Yeah, Sasha Fierce.
[111:53.42]That's her name.
[111:56.88]You guys are such jokesters.
[111:59.96]When have I ever joked, Jerma?
[112:03.52]What?
[112:06.32]How come we can't go over there?
[112:09.88]Is there no way we can go over there?
[112:10.88]Come on, is it going to be a secret entrance?
[112:15.55]Pilots, stop.
[112:18.57]I miss Stern's weapon that used to shoot gold out all over the place.
[112:22.75]That thing was awesome.
[112:23.75]I don't think you ever saw how ridiculous I had gotten it.
[112:26.98]I showed Jerma.
[112:28.28]It was pretty insane.
[112:29.38]I had a gold build that just, like, put...
[112:34.01]No, I'm pretty sure you saw it.
[112:35.43]Yeah, we were there.
[112:36.35]Like, you would leave trails of gold all over the place, and we'd just follow the gold.
[112:40.07]I know, I know, but I have the Hellfire Hammer that hits everything, like, like, ten times a second.
[112:46.96]And each hit, when you switched to your other weapon, would drop ten gold.
[112:51.12]And we'd get, like, a hundred thousand.
[112:53.90]Holy God, that was a lot.
[112:55.42]I kind of just got hit by every single one.
[113:11.21]Brutality!
[113:12.25]Brutality!
[113:13.13]Brutality!
[113:13.91]There's a little chicken here.
[113:16.27]I've returned to submit my ears to more chickens, instantly reconsidering this choice.
[113:22.02]I'll use my scythe more, okay?
[113:25.28]The chickens are good.
[113:27.34]Chickens are good?
[113:29.04]They do a lot of splash damage.
[113:31.54]Chickens are good.
[113:32.50]They do a lot of chicken damage.
[113:33.88]None of us else are using the chicken element.
[113:37.68]I hear vampires are weak to chicken.
[113:40.24]It's true.
[113:42.17]And spiders.
[113:42.61]Let's kill them.
[113:43.97]Consult the lore.
[113:45.13]How are we supposed to do something with this dude?
[113:47.82]Kill him.
[113:48.20]Without dying or something.
[113:54.72]All the... X's are off.
[114:04.92]Jays!
[114:05.78]Whoa!
[114:17.03]Every time it teleports, I think it's dead.
[114:19.09]I know, really.
[114:22.05]The dancing tomb.
[114:22.97]Chromatic Essence 2.0.
[114:28.27]Is that a book?
[114:32.25]Yeah.
[114:33.01]It's the new drops.
[114:35.19]Where are the books?
[114:38.71]Should it be in your inventory in the weapon slot?
[114:41.89]Oh, and the weapons.
[114:42.81]Yeah, it's like a new weapon category.
[114:46.53]Oh, stars are already moving.
[114:48.50]I don't see any books in here.
[114:54.04]Whoa!
[114:54.80]Oh, you're already in this area.
[114:57.36]I'm on that grind, yo!
[115:23.93]They split again.
[115:25.03]Guys, I have to use the chickens.
[115:26.81]If I get near these things, I get sniped in the butt.
[115:31.83]Use the chickens.
[115:32.49]I don't care.
[115:33.09]No one cares.
[115:34.97]The chat cares, and I care about them.
[115:36.67]They're not even that loud.
[115:45.46]Yeah, I wanted to watch Jerma, not a bunch of chicken noises.
[115:48.84]They're like the same thing.
[115:50.99]Come on, guys.
[115:54.21]It's a bunch of chicken noises.
[115:55.53]Jerma, chicken noises.
[115:57.77]Same thing.
[116:01.13]Your next video is just like a blank video and a bunch of chicken noises.
[116:10.14]It's just titled Chicken Noises.
[116:13.36]What is the reaction to that video?
[116:14.96]I don't know, dude.
[116:16.68]I want to make that.
[116:17.40]How many emails would you get asking if you did help?
[116:19.45]The chicken video.
[116:21.29]I might actually make that and disable comments.
[116:24.99]If that can't be my next video, though.
[116:27.43]Hold on, you want to make the chicken video as your next video?
[116:31.81]No, no, absolutely not as my next video.
[116:34.69]But in the future, it's worth considering.
[116:37.24]Like, wow, he made this like...
[116:41.54]There's nothing to do, like, so depressed video, and now he's just uploading chicken noises.
[116:47.02]Dude, actually, I think that would be hilarious as your next video.
[116:50.75]Wow, what a copier of Donkey.
[116:52.43]Remember when he uploaded just, like, a video of scenery and nothing else?
[116:56.23]No, that was really well edited, and that's not the same.
[116:59.09]Yes, it is.
[117:01.33]Did we do it?
[117:01.87]Did we win?
[117:02.58]We win.
[117:05.22]Still can't buy anything.
[117:06.90]Well, the guy is there all of a sudden, for no reason.
[117:10.12]Wow.
[117:11.18]Yeah, that's the weapon that I had.
[117:13.54]This is the one that I had in my inventory, and it just doesn't exist anymore.
[117:17.18]I don't know why.
[117:18.64]Did I just not pick up the Demon's Souls, or were there none this time?
[117:24.85]What?
[117:27.01]What?
[117:27.81]I didn't get any Demon's Souls.
[117:29.77]Oh, how many times?
[117:30.25]We've done this the third time we've done this, right?
[117:32.09]Yeah.
[117:33.33]I only have two.
[117:33.79]I only have two.
[117:37.39]None dropped for me this time.
[117:39.17]Whoa.
[117:40.50]So they don't have a guarantee to drop?
[117:42.18]I feel like they should.
[117:44.64]I mean, getting two and three runs and you need 70 to buy something?
[117:50.57]You're going to have to do this like a hundred times.
[117:53.19]Seems really overpriced for what it is too.
[117:56.71]Like, every single one of these legendaries I already have except for Spark and the new book.
[118:06.37]By the way, Spark, that's the item that I have.
[118:08.33]That's the... That's the good one.
[118:11.50]The devil card is a hundred souls.
[118:16.72]You can buy that shit from the vendor in town for gold.
[118:21.20]For like 20,000 gold.
[118:22.90]Is there no difference to it?
[118:23.98]Are you sure there's no difference?
[118:25.70]Yes, there's no difference.
[118:29.22]Something's not right here.
[118:30.18]There has to be, like, another area with more of these.
[118:33.32]I know.
[118:33.93]Are we morons?
[118:35.73]Is this, like, the only place you can get these?
[118:37.55]I don't know.
[118:42.09]Maybe... I don't know.
[118:44.85]Because we played a little bit of the game before and we didn't get any.
[118:47.76]Yeah, I guess.
[118:48.26]Those other areas.
[118:48.92]I have no idea who Ashley is.
[118:53.08]Where did she come from?
[118:54.62]You don't know Ashley?
[118:56.52]Come on.
[118:57.88]Dude, you don't know Ashley?
[118:59.12]Come on, man.
[119:00.24]Damn.
[119:00.92]Oh my god.
[119:01.72]Dude doesn't know Ash.
[119:04.26]Like, follow, and subscribe.
[119:06.00]Tell us, where did you come from?
[119:08.28]Where do you hail from?
[119:10.83]I just crawl up from under this desk for this stream.
[119:13.23]No.
[119:13.29]No, where did you come from?
[119:14.69]And then when the stream is over, I'm going to crawl back in under there.
[119:17.51]She's lying.
[119:18.15]Can we boot her from the call?
[119:20.75]I don't think I have that.
[119:21.95]I came for my mother, OK?
[119:27.12]I don't think I can.
[119:28.22]So, uh, who wants to do a little bit of PvP?
[119:31.82]I would love to PvP.
[119:32.92]Who wants to do a little bit of player versus player action?
[119:36.58]Adventure!
[119:37.76]I bet Ashley beats you.
[119:39.57]I don't think so.
[119:41.95]I don't know.
[119:42.29]Can you take on my rainbow gun?
[119:44.89]That depends.
[119:45.43]Can you take on my skills?
[119:49.73]Your skills?
[119:51.09]Yeah, my skills.
[119:53.80]Yeah!
[119:55.76]Okay.
[119:58.02]Let's do a little bit of player versus player action.
[120:00.86]Why not?
[120:02.32]Alright, dude.
[120:05.51]Alright, dude.
[120:06.19]You wanna go down to Pound Town?
[120:09.75]Shut up.
[120:12.24]I don't know why I thought that was funny.
[120:15.22]And then the stream ends.
[120:18.79]That would have been a really good time to do that.
[120:20.79]We didn't even PvP.
[120:22.75]Just shut up.
[120:24.51]Shut up.
[120:26.93]Alright, let's go to PvP town.
[120:30.24]Where is it?
[120:31.12]The freak show?
[120:33.44]Circus something?
[120:34.10]Yeah, it's the freak show, isn't it?
[120:37.78]Alright, guys.
[120:42.25]Ready to see me do a little bit of ass kicking?
[120:47.54]Ah, no!
[120:48.68]I just wanna watch.
[120:51.97]Potion- wait a second.
[120:53.49]He potioned.
[120:54.41]He potioned.
[120:55.33]I was in my inventory.
[120:56.65]He potioned.
[120:57.53]Guy po- you broke the golden rule.
[121:01.65]I don't remember anyone saying start.
[121:06.96]What a fucking loser.
[121:10.48]What a, like, nerd.
[121:16.13]That was a pretty good potion, though, I will say.
[121:17.81]I don't think you're going to be able to beat me.
[121:19.97]I'm gonna put my tryhard pants on.
[121:21.35]You have, seriously, before we do any of this, can we please address that you have the best item build in this entire game?
[121:30.62]Can we just address that?
[121:32.06]I might have the best build.
[121:33.46]You have the best item build in the entire game.
[121:37.62]All the cards are perfect, all your items are perfect.
[121:40.50]Give us a little bit of slack.
[121:42.76]You ready?
[121:43.20]You ready to go?
[121:45.99]Where are you?
[121:47.91]I'm on the map.
[121:48.97]Okay.
[121:49.63]I'm ready.
[121:50.21]Let's go.
[121:57.17]There's no way I'm gonna kill you.
[122:01.02]Okay, Ster, you can't use a gun.
[122:02.92]He's using the repeater and he's unkillable and he can kill you in like three hits with that thing.
[122:08.56]Okay, taking off the gun.
[122:09.88]We do sword battles here.
[122:14.81]Hammer battle?
[122:15.47]It's got super wrong range.
[122:16.79]It does a ton of damage.
[122:18.21]It has the wrong range.
[122:19.31]It's got the wrong range.
[122:20.33]I, uh, no.
[122:24.40]Whoa.
[122:30.30]I think they fixed this.
[122:31.46]No, they didn't.
[122:32.24]Alright, are you ready?
[122:32.82]You look really stupid on my screen.
[122:34.52]You're like teleporting all over the place.
[122:36.71]Let's do it.
[122:37.99]Oh, is this what desyncs it?
[122:40.69]Uh-uh.
[122:40.97]What are you doing?
[122:41.57]I don't know.
[122:44.39]Yeah, this is desyncing it really bad.
[122:46.41]Uh-oh.
[122:46.89]That hammer?
[122:47.81]Yeah.
[122:48.03]Are you sure it's desyncing?
[122:56.11]Yeah, I guess it is.
[122:57.31]I mean, it doesn't look like it is for me.
[122:58.69]Are you going to be testing desync, or are you just going to kill me?
[123:04.11]I'm killing you.
[123:05.83]Dang, now I got a 20-second wait time for you to, like, make the I killed you joke.
[123:11.31]There it is.
[123:12.81]Oh, oh, no good numbs down.
[123:16.05]That actually looks pretty good.
[123:18.22]You might have been able to beat him if you didn't lose that item.
[123:20.80]Okay, maybe I'll take off the hammer.
[123:25.54]Maybe, like, what's the list of items I can't use?
[123:28.28]I don't know.
[123:31.03]Use whatever you want.
[123:31.75]Okay, you ready?
[123:33.91]Except the repeater.
[123:36.27]Except the thing that can insta-kill any of us.
[123:39.99]Fuckin man, let's go three two one action He didn't hurt him he did the suck-in move and then insta killed me yeah So what is what's that band now?
[123:59.93]No, I just gotta know when you're gonna do it
[124:06.90]I'm gonna shoot your corpse.
[124:08.60]Hey, don't do that.
[124:11.37]I'm infusing you with my power, Jerma.
[124:13.09]Oh, sorry.
[124:15.37]Remember last time we did this and this was, like, fair and it was, like, fun?
[124:19.67]I do.
[124:21.17]What happened?
[124:21.85]Are you guys the same level?
[124:23.71]Yeah, but he's got the good items, not fair items.
[124:26.57]Items, Jerma, items.
[124:28.91]Three, two, one, go.
[124:37.40]do anything.
[124:40.68]Okay.
[124:42.20]I don't even know what you just did.
[124:45.63]All I know is you were like 50 feet away from me and then I died.
[124:49.93]You know how I told you what the best item in the game is?
[124:53.57]It's because it's the best item in the game.
[124:56.45]Well, you have the best item in the game.
[124:59.94]Look where you're standing.
[125:01.56]Oh, never mind.
[125:02.54]Apparently that's a little too far.
[125:03.84]Hold on.
[125:11.87]Whoa.
[125:12.66]Ow.
[125:13.60]Yeah.
[125:14.44]It hits everywhere, and you're stunned, and then you're probably dead.
[125:17.50]Strike with the eye and talk.
[125:25.24]Hey, you heard him.
[125:25.74]I did.
[125:26.90]You dazed him.
[125:30.13]Goddamn.
[125:31.59]That crit for 2,000.
[125:32.99]Why does this arena make you wait for 20?
[125:35.77]Oh.
[125:35.95]Yeah, I don't know why.
[125:37.29]I shouldn't do that.
[125:38.75]Ha ha ha.
[125:40.68]why does this make you dance dance with me no don't shoot me while dancing oh mean oh mean I can't kill him you think I can kill him yes kill him alright well you just you just hit me I know I was aiming for you potion
[126:11.51]But when are you going to stop going easy on Sterk?
[126:14.85]Stop going easy on him?
[126:17.00]That one's no.
[126:18.50]Potion!
[126:19.70]Potion.
[126:22.48]You can potion as much as you want, dude.
[126:28.63]Double jump!
[126:30.81]Watch this one, guys.
[126:31.51]You want to see this one?
[126:32.59]You want to see a fucking real player right here?
[126:34.73]Yeah.
[126:44.66]My mouth is just hanging open.
[126:46.66]I died in the air, and it just glitched me into the ground.
[126:52.52]Even if we 2v1 him, Jerma and Ashley should 2v1 Starb.
[126:56.15]We'll still lose.
[126:56.93]Yeah, we'd probably still lose.
[126:59.47]Let's do it.
[127:00.17]Let's do it.
[127:00.55]Let's lose.
[127:01.73]I have gimped myself, too, with my weapon choices.
[127:03.73]Alright, get him.
[127:11.65]Did that really kill you?
[127:13.05]I died in one hit.
[127:14.15]Wow.
[127:15.93]Tomes are good.
[127:16.61]I have not used that before.
[127:19.56]Is it over?
[127:20.66]Now that he's dead?
[127:21.32]I thought it was over.
[127:22.84]Get him.
[127:23.46]I thought it was over.
[127:29.23]I used a potion.
[127:30.15]I used two potions.
[127:31.51]I want to hit you with this and just see how much it does.
[127:34.21]Oh, it was hard to aim.
[127:38.77]That is a long stun.
[127:40.63]So that's just a much better version of this and much wider.
[127:45.68]Dancing does not restore health.
[127:49.80]What did you hit me with that instantly kill?
[127:51.84]I was full health down to nothing.
[127:54.51]I have no idea what the hell you did.
[127:59.51]I just shot that beam at you really closely.
[128:02.43]Don't.
[128:03.05]Hit me really closely with that.
[128:04.25]I want to see if... Because that seriously was... I think it is... I think the dash weakens you.
[128:09.39]Let me check the codex.
[128:11.07]Try not... No, it doesn't.
[128:18.83]What I did was... That's all I did.
[128:24.45]Is that really all you did?
[128:28.39]I'm alive still, though.
[128:30.89]I know.
[128:35.59]Oh, I'm sorry.
[128:36.77]What was that?
[128:38.33]What was that?
[128:41.43]I think it was just it crit you is the only difference.
[128:44.71]For 4 over 4k?
[128:45.89]That's like my entire health pool.
[128:47.03]Holy shit.
[128:50.71]Seriously.
[128:51.23]Holy shit.
[128:52.09]It says 4.3k. 4300.
[129:00.34]Yeah, that seems really good.
[129:01.68]This isn't even, like, a good spell book.
[129:03.56]I just took whatever one I had.
[129:15.22]So, it's just a crit from your B?
[129:18.40]Yeah.
[129:19.18]From your B. Now, how many people can we, like, get in here to let go of, like, 5v1 versus you?
[129:31.02]I don't know, how many people can you actually get in a victor's line game?
[129:33.20]Oh, it's like four.
[129:34.00]I don't know.
[129:43.08]No, it may be eternal.
[129:44.08]Jesus, that's long days.
[129:48.89]Whee!
[129:53.79]Well, remember how you said we were like on the same playing field and it was like we could like have good fights?
[129:59.11]Yeah.
[129:59.47]Then you played 20 more hours than me.
[130:02.03]This happens in every game, Jerma.
[130:06.20]Why?
[130:06.54]I had to figure everything out.
[130:07.80]I had to.
[130:08.52]Because the challenge mode, I had to figure it out.
[130:12.26]What the?
[130:14.22]Eat this!
[130:15.52]Wow, that was half your health?
[130:17.05]Yeah.
[130:17.17]I wasn't even near you.
[130:23.51]Ah!
[130:24.35]That killed me.
[130:24.93]Just, like, tapping the button.
[130:28.73]Don't worry, guys, I'll show you how you really do something.
[130:31.61]Does anyone have a max level Viktor Brand character who would care to join the arena?
[130:38.21]What do you have for an outfit?
[130:40.23]Adventurer outfit.
[130:42.56]Me too!
[130:44.58]I have the high armor one.
[130:45.68]Gives you extra card slot, and then you double stack wild cards.
[130:49.96]Wild cards are the only good card.
[130:52.86]What mic is this?
[130:54.14]What mic am I using?
[130:55.54]This is a Neumann... What is it?
[131:01.30]Neumann T... It's the little, short, skinny Neumann.
[131:05.53]Something 102... Let me see on the other side here.
[131:07.71]TLM 102.
[131:10.95]I have the same one.
[131:13.37]It's expensive, but it's very, very, very, very good.
[131:17.75]Before this, I used an MXL 009, which was also good.
[131:24.69]Rainbow ball.
[131:27.77]Yeah, well, that's pretty cool looking.
[131:30.43]Enjoying bubble.
[131:31.19]Alright, Ashley, come here.
[131:38.21]What?
[131:39.07]It's time to 1v1 me.
[131:40.03]Me and you.
[131:41.23]Ah!
[131:41.59]Was that you?
[131:43.83]Hey, Star, stop it.
[131:44.77]I'm trying to 1v1.
[131:46.99]Stop it!
[131:48.55]What are you doing?
[131:50.01]Get off of me!
[131:52.53]Get away from me!
[131:53.31]That's so annoying.
[132:07.76]What the heck man what the fuck Wow you freaking kidding me Now I have to wait 20 seconds, let's don't make that don't do that anymore It's a full 20 seconds if you're gonna tell me you're gonna do it if you're gonna do it.
[132:28.48]Oh
[132:30.31]Do what?
[132:30.63]Kill you?
[132:32.47]Potion.
[132:33.53]Potion.
[132:33.89]Yeah, fine.
[132:34.29]Fucking 2v1?
[132:35.06]You want to do 2v1s?
[132:36.38]Fine.
[132:36.68]Let's do it.
[132:38.60]Both of you motherfuckers, I'll show you how it's done.
[132:42.06]Eat my bowl.
[132:43.54]Let me take you out first.
[132:45.57]Coming for you first.
[132:47.91]I'm not intervening.
[132:49.87]Jorma needs to win a fight.
[132:55.64]No, no, I did potion.
[132:58.14]You see how that was like climactic?
[132:59.95]No, I'm coming for you.
[133:01.97]Mr. Dickhead.
[133:03.97]Mr. Dickhead.
[133:07.51]What the?
[133:08.70]Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[133:10.20]You just hit me all the way back there.
[133:13.12]Yeah, this is the hammer that causes desync.
[133:16.57]What the heck, man?
[133:17.45]I seriously, like... Doing this jump glitch, like, breaks the game.
[133:21.75]Yeah, just stop jumping for a second while I just... I gotta look at the extraction manual and see what the... You're not gonna be able to hit me.
[133:36.04]Got away.
[133:37.08]God.
[133:38.30]I saw you cast that on my screen about six times.
[133:43.34]Stop desyncing the game.
