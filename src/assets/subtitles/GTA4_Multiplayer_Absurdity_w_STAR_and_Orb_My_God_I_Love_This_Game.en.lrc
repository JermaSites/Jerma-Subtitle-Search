[05:51.77]See, now everyone has bikes, because I have a bike.
[05:53.65]Like, everyone's a copycat.
[05:54.67]You can never be a hipster in GTA.
[05:58.95]As soon as I see something, I'm jumping.
[06:00.38]What happened up there?
[06:02.50]Tell me when you're jumping.
[06:03.80]Do a countdown.
[06:05.39]No, I'm like gonna hit a bike jump.
[06:07.13]Like a sweet a**.
[06:08.83]Like a 360, 1080.
[06:10.13]We're gonna get some air from this.
[06:17.14]Hit escape and see where I am right now.
[06:38.47]I don't know.
[06:39.13]I don't know how that happened.
[06:44.43]Wait, what the hell?

[06:48.12]What the hell?
[06:49.20]Me and him hit a jump right here.
[06:50.78]I launched off the bike.
[06:53.24]Yeah, let's ride to him.
[06:56.39]What the hell?

[07:16.40]Holy shit.
[07:19.22]That was seriously unbelievable.
[07:22.44]I thought you, like, landed behind me.
[07:24.32]I have no idea how that happened.
[07:28.28]I think it's because I jumped off the bike last second and we hit the telephone pole.
[07:32.18]Yeah, I'm alive.
[07:35.31]Not for long, apparently.
[07:39.85]And I'm dead.
