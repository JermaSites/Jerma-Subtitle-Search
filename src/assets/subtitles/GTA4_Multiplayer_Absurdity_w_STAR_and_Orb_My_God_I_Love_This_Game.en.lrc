[05:53.65]Like, everyone's a copycat.
[05:54.67]You can never be a hipster in GTA.
[05:58.95]As soon as I see something, I'm jumping.
[06:00.38]What happened up there?
[06:02.50]Tell me when you're jumping.
[06:03.80]Do a countdown.

[06:07.13]Like a sweet a**.
[06:08.83]Like a 360, 1080.

[06:48.12]What the hell?
[06:49.20]Me and him hit a jump right here.
[06:50.78]I launched off the bike.

[06:56.39]What the hell?

[07:16.40]Holy shit.
[07:19.22]That was seriously unbelievable.
[07:22.44]I thought you, like, landed behind me.
[07:24.32]I have no idea how that happened.
[07:28.28]I think it's because I jumped off the bike last second and we hit the telephone pole.
[07:32.18]Yeah, I'm alive.
[07:35.31]Not for long, apparently.
[07:39.85]And I'm dead.
