[00:02.74]Hello.
[00:03.92]Hi everybody.
[00:06.67]Yep, we're early today.
[00:07.57]A couple reasons why.
[00:10.23]I'll go over them shortly as I prepare the desk for somebody to sit here.
[00:22.66]Hello.
[00:25.92]It's been a little rough lately.
[00:27.72]I'm sure you're aware.
[00:30.36]We'll talk about that very briefly.
[00:34.67]Let me get situated and we'll start in like two minutes.
[00:38.33]See you in a minute.
[01:19.61]Alright, so today, we were supposed to do the emote contest today, but I didn't get enough time to get it ready and prepare it all the way.
[01:31.26]so we're gonna have to wait on that till probably I'm probably I need to give myself like another day because obviously what happened with the water damage over the last day or two and on top of that a company has been coming every week here to remove furniture and I just don't it's just not I can't do it I was my plan was today this afternoon I was gonna sit down and just get it ready
[01:59.54]I mean, it's ready.
[02:01.02]It just needs to be... We run into a problem with voting.
[02:06.68]I guess there's not a really... There's not a whole lot of reliable voting sites that can allow more than three or four selections that won't be abused.
[02:16.44]So there's really only one place I can actually get a true voting system.
[02:21.67]And it's a service that I need to pay for it.
[02:23.85]So there's been a lot of random little bumps for some reason.
[02:28.05]Use a mail-in ballot.
[02:31.33]Yeah, the emotes are all in the dryer.
[02:32.91]They need to be dried off.
[02:36.94]But, it's just... This last week especially has been all fucked up.
[02:45.16]This whole water problem could not have happened at literally a worse time.
[02:50.05]But, with that being said...
[02:52.24]I decided that today, we're just going to stream today.
[02:54.60]There was requests.
[02:56.14]There's been over the last six months on top of tonight to play Prototype.
[03:02.92]I've been waiting.
[03:03.50]I've owned Prototype and Prototype 2 for like three years.
[03:07.28]I've been waiting for an opportunity to play them.
[03:10.45]So I guess we're just going to play this tonight.
[03:13.63]Depending on how much fun we have.
[03:14.79]I might finish it over the next few days.
[03:18.48]I don't know.
[03:18.98]It's going to get real weird here.
[03:20.12]Because there's a lot of fucking shit that needs to be fixed in my house.
[03:24.18]And I got like a steam cleaner coming in like two days.
[03:28.45]I've got another stream that is taking some time to get ready that's happening this weekend.
[03:34.89]It's just been a mess.
[03:36.07]So, bear with me here.
[03:37.29]The emote contest is still going to happen this week.
[03:41.15]So, expect that to be probably on Friday.
[03:43.87]I'm going to give myself a whole day tomorrow to get shit situated.
[03:48.42]So, we stream tonight, and then Friday will be the emote contest, and then another stream this weekend.
[03:54.52]So...
[03:56.47]Why don't we get started?
[03:57.80]That sounds like a plan.
[03:58.60]Let me just tweet this.
[04:00.24]Give me one more minute, and we'll get going.
[05:24.23]When I was gone, we had $50 from Scripps3.
[05:26.59]Thank you, Scripps, for the $50.
[05:27.85]Holy shit, dude.
[05:29.77]Thank you.
[05:30.99]They say, please explain this video.
[05:32.61]Oh, that video.
[05:33.27]Okay.
[05:34.06]Sure.
[05:34.76]It's called 10 years ago.
[05:36.40]10 years ago.
[05:38.90]Actually, that was probably 12 or 15 years ago.
[05:42.50]Friends of mine, we made videos, and that's one of the ones somebody found.
[05:46.72]And that's it.
[05:48.60]That's like 20-year-old me.
[05:54.73]That's the explanation.
[06:00.08]But thank you so much for the $50, dude.
[06:01.72]Appreciate it.
[06:02.14]$35?
[06:05.88]I'm pretty fucking close.
[06:07.82]Let me just... Hold on.
[06:55.10]Okay, there we go.
[06:58.44]Oh, he's fucking 60.
[06:59.60]That'd be weird if I was.
[07:04.24]Make that clip an old sub song.
[07:05.36]Oh, let me address that.
[07:06.04]Hold on.
[07:06.98]Let me address something here really quickly.
[07:09.26]So... Yes, yes, there's a video floating around of me when I was younger.
[07:17.10]But they've since been removed.
[07:19.08]For one reason in particular.
[07:20.98]Because...
[07:22.75]A lot of people that don't do this shit for... Like, I don't give a fuck if I'm out there being like, oh, fuck you, fuck me, fuck me in the ass.
[07:32.30]I was like fucking 20, right?
[07:34.72]But there's a lot of people that are not in this scene that have nothing to do with this.
[07:43.20]That have their like, they have like families, and I don't even talk to these people anymore.
[07:48.71]That's why I'm not really like, I don't talk about it.
[07:52.23]I don't give a fuck if you watch it.
[07:54.67]But, they've been removed because...
[07:59.23]Like I said, these videos were recorded more than a decade ago, and a lot of people's names might be, you know, just please have respect for their privacy, not mine.
[08:10.68]Like, I don't, like, obviously, respect my privacy, too.
[08:14.20]Like, that, like, I deserve it as well.
[08:16.68]But they were removed for a very specific purpose because, guys, I don't even talk to even, probably, there's probably like two people in that video that I still talk to.
[08:27.68]So just be aware of that.
[08:29.92]It's not just about me.
[08:31.02]You know what I mean?
[08:33.86]But... Anyways.
[08:38.96]You sold your privacy for bits.
[08:44.05]Just be aware of that.
[08:46.43]Address these kind of things like you would if it was you or somebody that you knew.
[08:52.65]You know what I mean?
[08:55.01]It's like that.
[08:58.07]But, whatever.
[09:00.07]Let's go.
[09:02.46]Old content, old things that we don't need to address any more than we have to.
[09:10.14]But, I'm going to play Prototype.
[09:12.16]Hope you're here to enjoy it.
[09:13.31]Because I am.
[09:16.97]Our privacy policy has been updated.
[09:21.31]Now can we address Germacraft?
[09:24.11]What's to address about Germacraft?
[09:30.60]There's no... What's like the secret behind Germicraft?
[09:34.02]Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[09:38.98]Am I gonna make a sequel?
[09:41.88]No.
[09:42.58]Never again.
[09:44.76]Literally never again.
[09:47.93]Turn this off.
[09:50.15]All right.
[09:50.59]Hey, look at that.
[09:51.71]Close this window.
[09:52.69]Yes, I do.
[09:56.11]And you should see on your screen right now the game called Prototype.
[10:01.21]Ah, shit.
[10:01.73]You can't hear it.
[10:10.07]Now, unfortunately, this was kind of a hard game to get to work.
[10:14.39]Because it did not like the fact that I have six cores in my PC.
[10:24.46]So, we'll see if hopefully this actually works.
[10:31.32]Yeah, somebody said unequip them.
[10:34.40]Yeah, I'm gonna unequip my other cores.
[10:37.46]Yeah, I got a lot of cores.
[10:38.38]I'm full of cores.
[10:39.76]Alright.
[10:40.96]Here we go.
[10:42.68]New game.
[10:43.90]I've never played these before.
[10:45.03]I've owned them for a long time.
[10:53.88]Let's just go over this one to make sure.
[10:55.96]I'm sure I want to override it.
[10:59.00]Cross your fingers that this is actually going to work.
[11:04.34]Come on.
[11:05.12]Don't crash on me.
[11:05.99]Don't do it.
[11:06.87]Don't do it.
[11:07.29]My ceiling, like, almost caved in last night.
[11:09.21]Come on.
[11:13.61]Why is this going so slow?
[11:21.03]Uh...
[11:24.69]What's with the FPS here?
[11:27.89]Oh boy, oh boy.
[11:32.42]Are we gonna be alright here?
[11:33.60]This did not just happen.
[11:42.96]I got too many cores.
[11:50.27]Well, this is slow motion.
[11:52.78]Now, I just got this to work.
[11:54.30]I was just testing it.
[11:56.96]Hold on.
[12:02.21]It's only running on one of the cores.
[12:04.53]I was just working.
[12:06.01]What happens if I skip the cutscene?
[12:09.87]Oh, my God.
[12:10.69]That's not all right.
[12:13.35]Yeah.
[12:15.32]Yeah.
[12:16.18]This was not just doing this.
[12:17.62]I'm going to restart it.
[12:18.14]Let's restart it.
[12:21.52]I can promise you this was not just happening.
[12:28.05]Just quit.
[12:28.79]Get me out of here.
[12:31.73]Never buy a computer.
[12:36.29]That's normal frames.
[12:38.24]No.
[12:38.70]The sad part is I just...
[12:42.94]did this while I was capturing it.
[12:44.72]And of course, don't you know, it doesn't matter no matter what, something always goes wrong.
[12:49.82]Even if I just tested it 30 seconds before turning the stream on.
[12:53.58]So that's fun.
[12:54.96]Let's try it again.
[12:58.56]See if I can't get this to work.
[13:10.21]Okay, here we go.
[13:13.23]Yes.
[13:13.81]Yes, I own this computer.
[13:19.52]Turn off V-Sync?
[13:20.26]V-Sync is not on.
[13:23.40]Seems to be running perfectly fine now.
[13:27.06]Game's just a prototype.
[13:28.10]You gotta give it some slack.
[13:31.65]Turn on V-Sync.
[13:32.93]I don't think I want to turn on... No, this looks alright now.
[13:37.69]Okay, that looks alright.
[13:38.47]V-Sync should be off.
[13:40.07]It is.
[13:42.13]Alright, cross your fingers, let's go.
[13:43.77]What if I just do continue?
[13:45.35]Or should I just do new game?
[13:49.42]Oh god.
[13:50.64]A hundred dollars so far.
[13:53.02]Already.
[13:53.60]I just turned on the stream.
[13:55.46]Thank you, CADBTV, for the 50 bucks.
[13:59.04]Thank you so much, man.
[13:59.82]Get yourself some more cores.
[14:05.01]I will get myself more cores.
[14:07.51]That was the purpose of buying this.
[14:08.67]Alright, come on!
[14:09.39]Don't do this to me!
[14:11.07]Thank god!
[14:13.69]I was about to be so upset, but thank you so much, Cad.
[14:18.03]Now we can actually play.
[14:24.09]Thank you, Cad.
[14:24.65]You just bought us two extra cores here.
[14:26.13]250 international charges.
[14:29.97]40 cents per minute.
[14:31.39]That's a fucked up cell phone bill if I've ever seen one.
[14:37.72]Let's see here.
[14:44.74]Canal Street.
[14:46.34]Where does this take place?
[14:48.00]Well, this is very quiet.
[14:57.30]Don't!
[14:58.20]It just tried to slow down.
[14:59.22]Oh, don't do this!
[15:01.92]No!
[15:06.11]Oh, it's trying.
[15:07.67]So desperately.
[15:08.37]Oh, shit.
[15:20.08]Alright, can I be like a pessimistic asshole here?
[15:23.37]I'm about to be.
[15:24.27]I'm gonna be an asshole right now.
[15:27.47]Why are these... Okay, why is this game listed on... Why can I buy this on Steam?
[15:31.17]You know what I mean?
[15:33.51]Why is this purchasable on Steam?
[15:38.93]What the fuck?
[15:47.56]I'm not allowed to have my own options.
[15:51.59]Well, alright, let's go.
[15:52.31]Let's start it.
[15:53.79]Basic attacks.
[15:55.53]This is running so shitty.
[16:00.07]You know, I think I know what's going on.
[16:02.74]I know exactly what's going on.
[16:03.98]You don't need to tell me twice.
[16:07.06]What's happening here is, because I have too many cores in my computer, and I had to set this game to run on only one of them, because I had to, OBS is also using all those cores.
[16:19.48]So now we just have this.
[16:29.75]I need to turn down four wad in the... Fuck!
[16:40.22]Why don't I turn Vsync on and take off anti-aliasing?
[16:44.76]Come on, let me like sync it to my computer.
[16:53.44]Turn everything off.
[16:55.59]Well, we sure did try to do this.
[16:58.03]Okay, everything to low.
[17:01.51]None.
[17:02.49]Off.
[17:02.93]Apply.
[17:03.37]Nah, this ain't gonna work.
[17:05.49]It's because it's sucking on one PC.
[17:13.49]I need to play this on, like, PS3.
[17:14.45]Is this on PS4?
[17:23.65]Hey, all right.
[17:24.53]Well, that's a... We were supposed to not... This is... Oh, my God.
[17:33.77]This game seems like it's very fun too.
[17:35.57]Change the refresh rate?
[17:36.45]It's not the refresh rate.
[17:37.39]It's the fact that I physically am not allowed to play this game if I have more than four cores.
[17:43.47]I had to actually turn the process affinity.
[17:45.67]I had to make a new shortcut for the game.
[17:48.44]So remember, like, Steam sells this game, right?
[17:52.08]Nowhere does it say anywhere on that page, this game will not run if you have more than four cores.
[17:59.54]So, like, okay.
[18:01.12]They just don't curate anything.
[18:03.12]That's fine.
[18:04.10]Because this has happened, like, at least three or four times now.
[18:08.22]Refund the game?
[18:09.01]I can't refund the game.
[18:09.91]Because I bought the game, like, four years ago.
[18:14.31]And even then, I had fucking more than four cores.
[18:21.45]Goddammit.
[18:24.03]Alright.
[18:24.53]Well, here's a new plan.
[18:26.53]Hope everyone's ready for the new plan.
[18:29.01]We're gonna just quickly, just hold on just a second here, guys.
[18:33.69]Check the PC gaming wiki entry.
[18:35.13]Already did.
[18:35.71]Got the patch.
[18:36.37]Patch didn't work either.
[18:37.17]I have too many cores.
[18:39.53]This is the only thing that would work.
[18:41.74]The game is not designed to run on anything more than that.
[18:45.50]I tried it.
[18:46.82]Video games and computers are stupid.
[18:48.48]Video games are stupid.
[18:50.52]Computers are bad.
[18:51.20]Don't ever have one.
[18:52.00]Okay, so let's move on.
[18:54.60]I was ready for this.
[18:55.40]I was prepared for this, guys.
[18:56.65]I was prepared for a fucking nightmare situation.
[19:01.97]Here's the thing.
[19:04.35]We can either go right now.
[19:11.11]We can either go right to House Flipper.
[19:15.85]Or we can open up Holdfest.
[19:20.34]I think we can play House Flipper.
[19:22.10]I need to flip my own house here.
[19:24.18]Seriously.
[19:24.90]I'm just not happy right now.
[19:29.24]Not at all.
[19:33.01]Okay, but this version of Steam is on one processor.
[19:37.13]So I need to like get out of here and open up Steam again.
[19:39.62]Hold on.
[19:47.10]Yeah, well, I'm gonna tone this down and we're just gonna chill and just hang out and play House Flipper because...
[19:53.16]My level of stress this couple of weeks is like filling up pretty high.
[20:00.54]So we need to just relax for a little bit.
[20:02.38]You know what I'm saying?
[20:03.72]We need to just chill out.
[20:06.95]Too many things at the same time seem to be happening.
[20:11.47]Okay.
[20:12.45]This is not going to fuck this up, is it?
[20:14.71]Let me just check.
[20:19.59]No, I want to open it up from here because that's a different... That's not fun.
[20:26.08]All right, guys, hold on.
[20:26.86]I promise I'm not going to have any issues.
[20:30.88]I'm not going to get angry.
[20:31.94]We're just going to accept the fact that there's some issues.
[20:36.49]And that's it.
[20:39.52]I've been doing some Zen breathing lately.
[20:41.42]If you don't know what Zen breathing is, it's when you breathe in and breathe out very slowly.
[20:46.43]And when you breathe in, you hold your breath for six minutes.
[20:49.63]So it's breathe in, hold it for six minutes.
[20:53.95]And you can always tell when it's working because like you start to see stars and the world starts to close in.
[20:58.18]But you got to keep that.
[20:59.12]I was told that's how you get to enlightenment.
[21:00.78]So.
[21:08.99]Oxygen deprivation.
[21:10.02]Don't do that.
[21:10.96]That's what clowns do that.
[21:13.32]All right.
[21:14.18]Let me get back to what I was doing.
[21:15.34]I'm so easy now, Jeremy.
[21:18.44]Easy.
[21:20.58]Okay.
[21:21.05]Where was I going?
[21:22.61]What was I doing?
[21:23.57]Just take it one step at a time.
[21:27.33]Okay.
[21:30.17]Yes, this is what you were doing.
[21:32.36]Open it up.
[21:33.84]Everything's going to be just fine.
