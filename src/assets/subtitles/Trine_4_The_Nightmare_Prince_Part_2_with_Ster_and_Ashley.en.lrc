[00:01.06]What's up?
[00:04.38]Good afternoon, how are you?
[00:06.80]We're a little early today, yeah.
[00:08.28]There's a reason for that, though.
[00:13.07]We are early because I wanted to pull the stream back to be able to do two different things today.
[00:19.23]Originally, it was gonna be like a three-hour stream in Jackbox, but I've decided...
[00:26.97]And, well, I was asked to, uh, play Trine.
[00:31.53]So there's gonna be, uh, starting now, there's gonna be, like, a couple hours, maybe two or three hours of Trine, with Star and Ashley.
[00:42.81]And then, Star and Ashley are also going to join us for Jackbox.
[00:49.95]So, I'll, this will be, this will not be a three hour stream.
[00:55.71]Pulling it back lets us do both.
[00:58.37]But I do have to hard stop this stream between like 5.30 and 6 o'clock Pacific.
[01:05.56]6.30 maybe at the latest.
[01:08.34]Because I have to leave.
[01:10.70]I have to get on an airplane.
[01:15.30]I've got to go.
[01:17.08]This is the week.
[01:18.24]I have to prepare.
[01:19.01]And I got to go.
[01:29.44]For what?
[01:30.98]Well, it's funny that you asked.
[01:33.83]Nobody.
[01:34.85]I didn't even see it.
[01:36.41]The Halloween stream requires a lot more setup and time.
[01:41.63]So I'm going to a studio.
[01:43.72]And I'm going back east.
[01:49.42]Nobody asked.
[01:50.58]The one paid actor did.
[01:53.02]Yeah, going back to the East Coast.
[01:55.14]I'm going to visit some family and friends while I'm there.
[01:57.82]Gives me an opportunity to be in Boston for a while.
[02:02.12]Hang out.
[02:05.21]I'm not going to stream to the Halloween stream.
[02:06.67]After today, there's not going to be a stream until Halloween.
[02:11.85]Just to let you guys know.
[02:14.35]The Halloween stream is the next stream after this one.
[02:19.68]Back to Boston.
[02:20.94]Here we go.
[02:25.17]But yeah, that's the plan, and I believe we're kind of just ready to go.
[02:29.87]Let's just see if we are.
[02:32.41]Hello?
[02:33.03]How is everybody doing?
[02:35.13]Hello?
[02:36.53]Hello?
[02:38.39]Not bad.
[02:39.69]Pretty good.
[02:40.35]Alright.
[02:42.85]That's Star, and that's Ashley.
[02:46.17]They are... Star and Ashley!
[02:51.43]It's power and wisdom and what was the other one?
[02:54.21]Courage.
[02:55.19]How could you forget courage?
[02:59.38]I didn't know it.
[03:00.12]She never told me.
[03:01.00]How am I supposed to know if my wife doesn't tell me?
[03:03.95]Unbelievable.
[03:05.72]Wait, where did we leave off?
[03:07.58]What did we do last time?
[03:08.68]I don't remember.
[03:09.08]Okay, so last time, where we left off in the Three Triners, we definitely paid attention to the entirety of the plot, and I think the Nightmare Prince ran away from us because he didn't want to be locked in the castle, and now we're chasing him.
[03:23.11]Oh, that's right, we are chasing somebody.
[03:25.56]Yeah, the Nightmare Prince, who's having these dreams, and his dreams are coming to life, and the only thing he dreams about are a wolf.
[03:36.69]Does he really deserve our help?
[03:37.97]I know he is a prince.
[03:39.01]Well, I think our characters were touching on that a little bit, like, that we were wasting our time, and that he was a snotty little brat.
[03:46.97]And, um... Why do you guys care about the story?
[03:48.73]Like, honestly, I have the power to create boxes.
[03:51.61]Do you think I'm gonna waste my time on this kid?
[03:54.01]Dude, we already said it before.
[03:55.29]Last time, we did the Three Triners four.
[03:58.98]Lore megalo.
[04:00.90]You're the one that asked!
[04:02.58]Oh, did I?
[04:03.20]You said, where did we leave off, so I explained it.
[04:07.66]I did not just ask what... No, I said, like, in the video game, like, where did we leave off.
[04:12.75]Right here.
[04:13.89]Yeah, but then you started going off on, like, the story, and I started to get fucking tired.
[04:16.99]Well, where else... Like, where... What else would you be asking?
[04:20.05]I don't know.
[04:22.49]Like, what was the last puzzle we did?
[04:25.67]Like... Who cares?
[04:27.93]You don't care about the lore, but you care about the last puzzle we did.
[04:31.15]Yeah, I don't know.
[04:32.77]What's the context?
[04:34.31]Remember the wizard hall, like, full of mirrors?
[04:36.41]Yes!
[04:37.07]Thank you!
[04:37.49]It got to be important?
[04:38.41]Thank you!
[04:38.91]You started talking about, like, story, and I started to get fucking tired.
[04:45.21]Oh, we got a wall here.
[04:46.17]Oh, right.
[04:46.69]Fighting.
[04:47.97]There is fighting in this game.
[04:49.05]Oh, this is the wolves he's dreaming about.
[04:54.42]He also dreams of platforms a lot.
[04:56.02]Wolves.
[04:56.96]White wolves, though.
[04:57.66]Can somebody explain it to me?
[05:00.44]Can you explain Silent Hill?
[05:04.26]Oops.
[05:04.72]My chat's saying that he's a furry.
[05:08.53]Probably right.
[05:09.15]Boston accent.
[05:09.85]There's a deer in the background.
[05:11.07]You guys just ran by.
[05:12.17]Wait!
[05:13.71]Are you skipping all the... We need these, don't we?
[05:17.29]Yeah, rowdy.
[05:20.26]I got one.
[05:24.06]B.R.
[05:24.68]Mega Lulston.
[05:27.01]Oh, yeah, and then I was doing all the dialog for my character, and it was a lot of fun.
[05:31.01]Everyone laughed.
[05:32.55]We had a really good time with that joke.
[05:34.11]This is a new mechanic, and you talked over the whole thing.
[05:37.01]Daddy, I'll be... Oh.
[05:38.57]Oh, it is a new mechanic.
[05:40.07]There's things on the wall.
[05:40.77]I can freeze that.
[05:43.37]Oh, thank you.
[05:45.71]And then I think you might have to... Alright.
[05:47.84]Give me the box.
[05:48.98]Put the box over there so she can get the... The droplet?
[05:53.30]Jeremy's blood?
[05:55.16]Yeah, Jeremy's blood.
[05:57.63]Now what, we leave?
[05:59.71]Okay, uh, one of us is locked out.
[06:02.65]Uh, shit.
[06:03.99]Just shoved it right in the perfect spot.
[06:07.99]Oh, thanks.
[06:08.87]Alright, I've got that, and I'm gonna cut you guys loose and you can go on the ride.
[06:11.25]You ready?
[06:12.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:13.39]Let's go.
[06:14.23]Whee!
[06:15.35]Nice.
[06:15.71]Wasn't that fun?
[06:19.43]I sacrificed myself.
[06:20.51]Is that gonna flip?
[06:21.45]You're missing the blood.
[06:23.80]Yeah, but you can get that.
[06:24.66]But I can't get that.
[06:25.42]You can get that.
[06:26.14]I can't get that.
[06:27.18]Can I get that?
[06:27.94]Here.
[06:31.29]Stop, Ashley.
[06:32.05]Stop hitting my box.
[06:33.87]I'm gonna push this.
[06:36.45]Jerma watches the departed in Boston Red Sox baseball every day.
[06:41.89]You say that as a joke, but I think that is, like, required reading if you live in Boston.
[06:50.91]Like, at least once every couple years.
[06:53.21]That, like, is what happens.
[06:54.25]Oh, I didn't mean to freeze that.
[06:56.73]I was talking.
[06:57.37]You ruined it!
[06:58.97]We were having fun.
[06:59.75]Just jump up here.
[07:01.53]Me?
[07:01.73]Yeah, just get the blood.
[07:04.48]Hold on.
[07:05.26]The Departed is amazing.
[07:08.02]Yeah.
[07:08.70]Okay.
[07:09.26]Two bloods.
[07:10.44]You didn't say it right, though.
[07:11.46]You didn't put an A-H in your word.
[07:13.68]It's the fucking Departed.
[07:17.27]If you don't say the F-word in the middle either, you're dead.
[07:19.91]I know it's a true... I know who's a true Boston fan if you don't say the fuck about it.
[07:24.68]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[07:30.04]Why was I trying to freeze that rock?
[07:31.42]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[07:32.62]You gotta take the boulder to the left to activate the lotus sigil.
[07:37.20]Should I freeze that?
[07:40.01]What about what's up there?
[07:41.01]What's up there?
[07:41.63]I can do this.
[07:45.79]See?
[07:46.01]I knew I was supposed to go up there.
[07:49.05]Alright, so now, how do you get over there?
[07:51.77]Come with me.
[07:53.63]That works.
[07:55.12]Well, now you need to block that.
[08:02.28]Wait.
[08:02.72]Oh, because the boulder has to be over it.
[08:06.67]Yeah, with your power, right?
[08:08.01]You do it, and then you dash back.
[08:10.64]I think these lamps are fire, so if I light them, I just open the door.
[08:15.94]Alright, nice.
[08:17.34]Yeah, wow.
[08:18.90]I fucking pot it, nice.
[08:20.43]Oh yeah, that's where we left off.
[08:21.65]My character can't do anything and I just make boxes and do everything.
[08:25.13]You gotta remember that it's your job to do everything.
[08:26.57]No, you were really important last time.
[08:27.57]We went over this.
[08:28.63]No.
[08:29.81]Uh, we need to all get a boulder.
[08:31.35]I can do this.
[08:36.66]You're part of Joe.
[08:37.86]Ovegalo, +2.
[08:43.29]How many elements did you get hit?
[08:44.97]Oh, you got fucking destroyed.
[08:46.43]It's alright, I'm at full health.
[08:48.43]I don't care.
[08:51.05]I'm fine.
[08:52.97]My true strength is respawning.
[08:54.53]Thanks, Rem.
[08:58.41]So... I think we can- can we just all get up there?
[09:03.42]If we jump from here to there?
[09:04.50]Uh, yeah, there's a lot of stuff up here.
[09:06.86]Now how do you get up here?
[09:07.60]You gotta go this way.
[09:09.46]When I got my upgrade points I can't use...
[09:16.15]Daddy, help me.
[09:18.49]I can't see down that far.
[09:20.49]Left.
[09:21.80]Left.
[09:23.46]Left.
[09:24.30]Well, that works too.
[09:27.62]Yep.
[09:28.02]Oh, there's a bunch of shit up here, isn't there?
[09:29.26]There's a bunch of stuff up here.
[09:30.38]There's a... Whoa!
[09:31.98]Whoa!
[09:32.56]Whoa!
[09:38.60]Hold on, maybe my box can solve this.
[09:41.34]If that happened, that's seriously what would happen to you.
[09:44.30]You're just trying to kill me.
[09:46.72]Oh, crap.
[09:47.39]Nope.
[09:48.97]Aw.
[09:49.29]Okay, well, we can do this without Ashley.
[09:51.23]Star's real name is Danny.
[09:54.31]Mine?
[09:54.63]Yeah, your real name is Danny.
[09:57.17]Oh, there's nothing there right anyway.
[10:00.38]My real name is Jason Long, American Dragon.
[10:05.94]Whoa, dude, super boost!
[10:10.77]My name is Ollie Shotcaller.
[10:14.57]You blocked it.
[10:24.65]Was that a Fortnite bus horn?
[10:27.33]I don't know.
[10:27.67]I've never played it.
[10:28.41]Never?
[10:31.39]Not even the previous version?
[10:33.03]The zombies?
[10:33.85]Does the PlayStation 4 version count if I'm lying down on my side in bed bringing a monitor into my bedroom to play that game on the PS4, the regular original game for like 20 minutes?
[10:44.02]Does that count?
[10:45.46]Hey, Ashley, how about you hold your shield up for someone to jump on?
[10:48.48]How about you do that?
[10:49.72]Why are you eating my ass?
[10:52.41]What?
[10:57.14]Well, I can freeze that.
[10:59.70]Karma, just jump on the shield.
[11:00.79]Just jump on it.
[11:02.99]Please jump on me.
[11:04.73]Please.
[11:06.87]This is like the easiest... Oh, wait, I have to move that over there.
[11:09.75]You have to do it.
[11:10.53]Why is everybody yelling at me?
[11:12.90]Oh.
[11:14.16]No, now pull it up.
[11:15.76]I can't even pull it up.
[11:17.72]Pull it up.
[11:18.20]There.
[11:20.28]There.
[11:23.70]Oh.
[11:24.32]My.
[11:25.02]God.
[11:25.26]This is like the easiest puzzle.
[11:26.98]It's so easy.
[11:29.58]Okay, get... Why isn't it going?
[11:35.48]Wait, now get... No.
[11:36.60]Now, that's how you do it.
[11:37.97]I'm not supposed to be up here.
[11:40.15]Me being up here fucks this whole thing up.
[11:42.47]Why did you tell me to go over here?
[11:43.59]Put that back up there.
[11:47.75]Watch this.
[11:50.35]Okay, we did it.
[11:51.13]See, I just have to hang it.
[11:54.50]That was so easy.
[11:56.02]God.
[11:56.78]Then you're the leader.
[11:57.60]I'm glad you have a wizard.
[11:58.80]You think you're the leader.
[12:00.67]Why can't we be friends and have fun?
[12:02.17]There is no leader.
[12:03.07]I have the biggest hat.
[12:05.01]We have a 33% stake in this.
[12:08.29]All the same.
[12:08.87]Ooh, almost.
[12:17.50]Oh my god!
[12:19.50]But I actually get 38% for hosting fees.
[12:23.36]And because of the fire.
[12:24.80]I need my expenses for the fire.
[12:26.30]In fact, I probably like 42% because these are expensive.
[12:30.27]Okay.
[12:35.57]44%, I think, would be covered.
[12:36.69]Alright, now what do I do?
[12:41.37]You gloat from up there.
[12:49.90]In fact, you know what?
[12:50.66]In fact, I'll just take all of it, and then, like, I'll give you guys, like, a little bit to, like, for being here.
[12:57.48]Wait.
[12:57.72]I want all of this.
[13:09.13]Earshot.
[13:12.39]What is it doing?
[13:13.05]Why is it doing that?
[13:16.46]Behold my power!
[13:19.17]I can now make balls!
[13:21.90]Do it.
[13:23.46]Wait, what can you do?
[13:26.30]Press Q. How do I do it?
[13:29.76]I made them bouncy, too.
[13:31.42]It's a ball.
[13:32.79]Wait, it said I unlocked bouncy balls.
[13:35.41]Wow, you just shaved off the corners of your boxes.
[13:39.65]Great.
[13:41.69]Wow, that's some magic.
[13:42.89]That's a- what a power.
[13:45.60]You're just saving money.
[13:54.14]I also learned blink, but it didn't tell me how to do it.
[13:57.82]What?
[13:59.56]It's shift for me.
[14:03.54]Oh my god, I'm useful.
[14:05.62]I guess I have to spend these points.
[14:07.35]I have a teleport.
[14:11.07]Who are you guys using for an ult so we don't all do the same ult?
[14:15.73]What do you mean?
[14:16.51]Because you get more points than you can spend.
[14:19.35]For your one character.
[14:20.51]So who are you guys using for an alt?
[14:23.01]We don't have alts.
[14:24.33]I'm not doing that.
[14:27.54]You are the archer.
[14:29.10]Shut up and live with it.
[14:30.72]Can you get those bloods?
[14:34.08]You generate more experience points than you can spend.
[14:37.86]What are you doing?
[14:39.68]I can do the worms.
[14:42.15]Oh, my ball.
[14:42.47]I'm supposed to bash this?
[14:44.35]Why would this... Oh!
[14:45.95]Oh, I think... That wasn't a joke.
[14:49.01]There it is.
[14:49.77]I'm serious.
[14:50.61]I don't... I want to, like... What if we need to... I don't know.
[14:54.16]No!
[14:54.24]Being serious.
[14:56.10]We can't switch characters.
[14:57.20]This is, uh... Oh.
[14:58.90]Well, then this is classic.
[15:00.04]Why does it give you extra points?
[15:03.02]Because you can play this single player and switch for all three characters.
[15:07.20]I see.
[15:07.72]Okay.
[15:08.10]Well, we have to roll on your ball.
[15:10.46]Oh, my God.
[15:13.50]And I remain.
[15:18.76]Ashley, just die.
[15:19.50]If we both die, we'll appear at him.
[15:22.46]Okay.
[15:25.94]Okay.
[15:26.58]That's not working.
[15:27.84]Go forward.
[15:28.36]Go forward, Rowdy.
[15:30.34]It's not working.
[15:30.96]I've been standing over here this whole time.
[15:32.24]Come on.
[15:33.54]Keep going.
[15:34.51]I can't keep going.
[15:36.29]I need you.
[15:37.01]I can't get this.
[15:38.59]We're coming.
[15:45.55]See?
[15:45.85]I can't reach this.
[15:49.33]Almost worked.
[15:50.35]Now he appears over here.
[15:52.09]See?
[15:53.01]Maybe it has to be two people have to be there.
[15:55.83]Possibly.
[15:57.94]Dude, these puzzles are going to get crazy once all our powers reach their maximum potential and we're required.
[16:02.92]This looks too complicated.
[16:03.90]Let's just do Jackbox.
[16:07.38]Now you have that in your back pocket.
[16:08.66]It's going to be really annoying.
[16:10.94]What?
[16:11.48]Playing Jackbox?
[16:13.70]Oh!
[16:15.55]I said it once!
[16:16.45]That's the first time I said it.
[16:19.15]Well, you were thinking it the whole time.
[16:21.41]Hold on.
[16:21.97]It's hard to aim this.
[16:24.13]Because it snaps.
[16:29.40]Okay.
[16:29.52]Now you should be able to get up there.
[16:31.14]And then do the... Yep.
[16:34.60]Sick.
[16:35.38]Now drop a ladder.
[16:36.26]Drop a ladder?
[16:39.97]Now you... Here we go.
[16:42.57]You mean go on without you guys?
[16:44.33]Okay.
[16:44.49]Oh, so Daisy.
[16:45.30]Okay, now I do Daisy.
[16:47.42]Oh, shoot!
[16:48.30]What's up there?
[16:50.28]Fireballs.
[16:56.92]Oh, what's up top left?
[16:58.18]I don't know.
[16:58.48]What's up this way?
[16:59.28]Oh, shit.
[16:59.82]What's up this way?
[17:00.60]I don't know.
[17:01.08]Let's find out.
[17:01.62]Oh, this place is full of blood.
[17:03.86]Am I supposed to be here?
[17:06.45]Oh, my...
[17:09.18]You can't go up the... You can, you can.
[17:11.76]I mean, you can, but I hit the... What did I hit?
[17:15.62]I gotta hold my ball.
[17:17.08]Is that it?
[17:18.30]Yeah, Ashley didn't even want to come up this way.
[17:20.45]Can we go up higher?
[17:21.37]See if we can go up higher.
[17:25.91]Oh, shit.
[17:26.65]Okay.
[17:28.19]Looks like the way to go.
[17:31.35]Where do you guys go?
[17:32.37]We're doing the secret bonus area.
[17:36.62]The super difficult puzzle.
[17:39.58]It's not that difficult.
[17:41.18]It's extremely hard.
[17:42.42]It requires three people.
[17:44.16]Oh, come on.
[17:45.44]Oh, we also got a talisman.
[17:47.24]You lied.
[17:50.62]Yeah, it was really hard.
[17:54.66]The two Triners.
[17:56.84]Hey!
[18:00.33]Just momentarily.
[18:01.77]Momentarily, the two Triners.
[18:03.27]She's trying to kill us.
[18:07.51]Can you make it through?
[18:12.81]Almost died.
[18:15.37]That's not fair, you have a way to do that.
[18:23.63]Okay.
[18:26.68]Bring it down here.
[18:28.68]No, what are you doing?
[18:31.34]Almost.
[18:33.60]I'm keen to your bullshit now.
[18:39.58]That was a hard one.
[18:40.70]What was the point of that?
[18:41.90]There's a thing up here.
[18:42.58]There's a big one.
[18:44.12]There is a big one.
[18:45.12]Um, we gotta go up top left.
[18:47.14]So, when you said, when you were making the joke that this is a hard one, it is.
[18:50.42]You have to do this.
[18:56.91]Give me a box.
[18:58.87]Get a ball.
[19:01.31]Well, I can't grab the edge of that.
[19:03.35]Okay, well, that's my problem.
[19:05.07]You're gonna make fun of how I just shaved the edges off.
[19:08.19]I mean, that was pretty funny.
[19:10.64]Alright, now give me another one.
[19:17.54]Alright, now, uh, ooh, look at that.
[19:20.84]No!
[19:21.82]Catch it!
[19:22.60]Oh!
[19:23.06]You got it!
[19:26.83]No!
[19:28.87]Come up here.
[19:30.27]Do you need me to drop this?
[19:34.43]Are we good?
[19:35.47]We're good.
[19:36.31]We're good, okay.
[19:36.93]Okay.
[19:37.73]We are the three triners.
[19:38.85]Oh my god.
[19:39.55]Butterfly.
[19:42.37]Laughter.
[19:42.81]It's an incoming boss fight, probably.
[19:44.39]Wait.
[19:46.44]Why are you guys so far off the screen?
[19:53.10]Because we kept going forward, Cal.
[19:54.92]I thought it was a cutscene.
[19:58.90]And you have to roll down there.
[20:01.46]Oh.
[20:07.08]Oh, now, okay, hold on.
[20:08.78]Now it presses the button to get the stuff.
[20:12.99]Okay, okay.
[20:14.61]Oh, what about here?
[20:17.15]Drop a ball down the little area.
[20:22.87]It's gonna open this door.
[20:24.33]Cool.
[20:25.51]Dude, we're so smart.
[20:28.37]Somebody said, is this Paper Mario?
[20:30.77]Yeah.
[20:32.81]You know, I've never played Paper Mario.
[20:43.79]Have you never played it?
[20:45.87]No, I'm not a Nintendo boy.
[20:48.81]I played it.
[20:54.53]Can I make a rage to the ball?
[20:59.54]Probably.
[21:00.06]Why was it not rolling?
[21:05.66]I was walking forward.
[21:06.70]Only one person could roll it.
[21:09.74]Oh, fuck.
[21:12.48]Play it right now.
[21:14.32]Hey, what?
[21:16.82]Play it right now.
[21:18.15]Uh, no, I'm not gonna play Paper Mario right now.
[21:22.93]Okay, I've got a bridge.
[21:25.37]If you like Mario RPG, you should love Paper Mario.
[21:29.93]It's not that I don't like it.
[21:31.77]It's just not the same.
[21:32.91]Well, nothing's the same.
[21:37.17]I know.
[21:37.49]I know.
[21:43.55]Why don't we just break all the boxes?
[21:45.63]Maybe you might think to yourself, we could use that box.
[21:47.91]Somebody just said it's better.
[21:48.81]You have infinite boxes in your butthole.
[21:50.83]But I can only have one box.
[21:53.38]That was access to multiple boxes.
[21:55.08]Look how high we have to climb.
[21:56.52]What if we had an extra box right now?
[21:58.28]There's a box slot right there.
[22:00.14]No, not a ball slot, a box slot.
[22:02.76]The less boxes we have, the more useful you are.
[22:05.99]Think about that.
[22:08.37]Well, I'd still be the one moving the box.
[22:10.93]Yeah.
[22:12.70]Even if we have more boxes.
[22:15.46]But I like your boxes better.
[22:16.98]It's a compliment.
[22:18.40]He hates trying for these boxes.
[22:21.41]I'm like the wizard, like they're my friends.
[22:23.19]Like, please.
[22:24.05]Enough with the box breaking.
[22:26.27]I studied box magic.
[22:29.47]Don't kill any more boxes, please.
[22:31.23]They're so nice to me.
[22:35.05]These boxes don't get enough respect around here.
[22:37.67]That's an awful old man voice.
[22:38.99]You can do better than that.
[22:39.63]I know you can.
[22:40.53]Okay.
[22:43.97]That was even worse.
[22:45.33]Why the treasure there?
[22:46.25]You have a natural cube.
[22:48.42]It's getting there.
[22:51.34]Let me step in here for you.
[22:53.60]These boxes are so hard to control.
[22:56.50]If only I had my scrolls.
[22:59.42]Nice grandpa voice.
[23:03.80]I'll fuck my stomach.
[23:05.33]I can't.
[23:05.97]You know what?
[23:06.51]I can't laugh.
[23:08.53]I'm not supposed to be laughing.
[23:09.97]I think it needs to be you, Jerna.
[23:12.73]You roll on the ball.
[23:14.09]The ball is currently off.
[23:16.07]I'll take care of it.
[23:16.81]Let me step in for you here.
[23:21.21]No.
[23:21.81]No.
[23:24.35]No.
[23:25.29]Yes.
[23:27.31]There you go.
[23:29.22]This looks so stupid.
[23:35.46]Why?
[23:35.86]We don't even need a fucking ball.
[23:37.76]Get that fucking ball out of here.
[23:40.72]Oh my, I'm so angry.
[23:42.28]Hold on, I gotta calm down.
[23:44.52]Jesus.
[23:45.28]Oh, I got so fucking angry right there.
[23:47.34]Why?
[23:47.60]Oh my god, what's wrong?
[23:50.60]Fucking god.
[23:51.38]Hold on, I'm gonna... Alright, jeez, slow down.
[23:53.66]I'm trying to...
[24:03.00]You can do it!
[24:04.31]No, I'm not trying to jump on that.
[24:06.21]I'm trying to grab the thing.
[24:15.39]Jervis is a psycho.
[24:17.83]Oh, there's a secret tunnel down there.
[24:20.29]Are you kidding me?
[24:21.63]Let me see.
[24:22.27]Oh my god.
[24:24.26]Oh my god.
[24:24.80]You're going to have to freeze these when my box or ball is in front of it.
[24:39.25]Stop making me laugh.
[24:43.21]Alright, I'll get into this next time.
[24:48.72]Okay.
[24:50.08]I was going to say, if that didn't hit it, nothing will ever hit it.
[24:55.76]Alright, then you have to go.
[24:56.94]I'm going to hold this.
[24:59.89]Oh, fuck.
[25:04.78]Okay, I did it.
[25:06.30]Oops-a-daisy.
[25:06.92]No, I didn't.
[25:07.26]Oops-a-daisy.
[25:07.98]Oops-a-daisy.
[25:09.00]Oops-a-daisy.
[25:09.94]It was the wrong... Okay, hold on.
[25:11.58]I was... Don't let go.
[25:12.85]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[25:15.27]I'm trying to cut it.
[25:18.09]Alright.
[25:19.15]Now watch this.
[25:21.17]There.
[25:23.09]Okay.
[25:27.19]Ah!
[25:28.43]Come on.
[25:30.25]Fuck you.
[25:30.79]We didn't need you for this puzzle.
[25:32.01]No, no, no.
[25:35.44]We got it.
[25:35.80]Ooh, points.
[25:36.80]I still can't.
[25:40.98]So, was this just a secret area?
[25:42.76]Yeah.
[25:43.42]Oh, pressure.
[25:45.34]Yep.
[25:45.76]Can't go over there.
[25:50.15]Yeah, trying getting out of here without the ball.
[25:52.57]Uh, we're already both out.
[25:54.75]I meant, like, this way.
[25:55.91]Oh.
[25:57.89]Did it.
[26:01.79]Oh, I did it too.
[26:03.13]Okay, okay.
[26:04.01]You made that sound like it was gonna be way harder.
[26:06.27]Give it to me.
[26:08.61]Wait, there's another, uh, thing.
[26:10.09]To break.
[26:10.39]Oh my god, it's running!
[26:15.32]It's running away!
[26:16.40]Get it back!
[26:18.56]Alright, now you gotta actually pay attention, because we've got enemies.
[26:20.76]Bro's a big guy.
[26:23.90]How did I die?
[26:26.68]Wrong thing.
[26:28.41]Okay, this is all you.
[26:30.55]Wait, me?
[26:31.87]Yeah, we, we died.
[26:33.01]Oh.
[26:33.59]It's all because of the Jerm.
[26:44.24]Oh, they did, they fell.
[26:47.84]This game is way too easy.
[26:52.04]um there's been a few challenging things so far yeah what's the point of a game if I can't brag about it on like reddit after I beat it yeah I only play games with like two percent completion rates oh am I sticking the slot in the cube oh the most powerful ball damn it the moon
[27:20.07]Okay.
[27:21.51]Oh.
[27:22.73]Fights are meaningless.
[27:23.97]Yeah, it's like commentary on war.
[27:27.27]Stop.
[27:34.59]Stop.
[27:35.87]Stop it.
[27:36.45]No more funny things.
[27:39.19]I'm supposed to be the funny one.
[27:40.64]You stop making jokes.
[27:42.04]No, I have like fucking side pain.
[27:48.20]Why do you guys think I played Bushido Blade last night?
[27:50.22]Because there's no way it was going to be funny, and it was hilarious.
[27:53.93]What?
[27:55.27]Yeah, he's on this whole new thing where he just wants to, like, not have fun anymore.
[27:59.13]Alright, get rid of that box.
[28:00.13]It's too heavy.
[28:00.67]It's awesome.
[28:01.94]It's too heavy.
[28:02.50]Alright, now you gotta...
[28:10.14]Go on this one.
[28:11.16]Stop weighing it down.
[28:12.76]I'm the lightest weight trainer.
[28:14.00]I'm telling you, one more funny thing out of you and I'm out of this call.
[28:20.86]See?
[28:21.12]Alright, now I can freeze it.
[28:24.11]Or whatever.
[28:27.41]There's a hook over here.
[28:28.63]What's that hook for?
[28:29.93]What just happened?
[28:32.01]Did you cut my line?
[28:34.89]I did.
[28:35.19]I was pointing with my sword.
[28:37.65]I pointed too hard.
[28:44.43]Yeah, almost.
[28:46.26]I think that's the cheater's hook, so you just skip the whole thing.
[28:50.20]Kind of is, but you gotta be cheaters or what.
[28:51.80]Uh, there's a little thing I can pull.
[29:01.72]Pull it!
[29:02.74]Ow.
[29:03.06]Fine!
[29:10.56]What is this for?
[29:11.12]I don't understand the application here.
[29:14.20]Oh, to get us over?
[29:16.28]Just to make it easy?
[29:17.52]Well, we can all get over it.
[29:19.60]Oh, come on, dude.
[29:24.26]I'm your wife.
[29:26.14]I'm your wife.
[29:30.01]Statistically, most murders happen with people that know each other.
[29:34.83]Yeah, most husbands murder wives.
[29:37.01]Yeah.
[29:38.20]I'm saying, like, that's... Okay, you have to freeze this left one.
[29:41.92]What I'm saying is they're gonna catch it.
[29:44.96]What happened?
[29:46.94]You gotta catch me first, car.
[29:48.44]So this is done.
[29:49.04]You gotta put that up there, and then we put this one up here.
[29:53.74]That allows us to go up-up.
[29:55.08]Up-up.
[29:56.45]Up-up.
[29:57.09]Up-up.
[29:57.37]Up-up.
[29:58.27]Up-up.
[29:58.43]99% of husbands...
[30:08.32]Uh... What the fuck?
[30:12.39]I could just die.
[30:15.17]I don't wanna move.
[30:17.51]Yeah, how... What?
[30:21.21]Oh!
[30:22.75]You might have to freeze this one too, Jeremy.
[30:25.19]Okay.
[30:26.89]Open the door.
[30:28.36]Can you have two frozen?
[30:29.40]No.
[30:29.78]Oh!
[30:32.18]Oops.
[30:32.52]Alright, we're good.
[30:33.68]There we go.
[30:35.86]Okay.
[30:38.00]Buy a controller?
[30:38.58]This is... Wait, you guys don't think I'm using, like, the Mad Catz PS2 controller right now, do you?
[30:46.07]I have an Xbox One controller plugged in.
[30:49.09]I'm not using the... Okay, something's messed up when a moderator says, how would you murder your wife, Cat?
[30:57.13]Asking for a friend.
[30:58.19]Oh, yeah.
[31:02.21]Even worse, I actually like the Xbox controller.
[31:04.59]I like how it's bigger and fatter.
[31:06.61]The Xbox 360 controller, I think, is the best controller that's ever been made.
[31:12.13]Sure, I'ma like some bigger and fatter.
[31:13.73]The Xbox 360 controller is probably, is a pretty damn good controller.
[31:18.54]Or PS, mm.
[31:20.26]They, yeah, they made the perfect controller, but then made a new Xbox, and we're like, we gotta fuck this up.
[31:25.30]Yeah.
[31:25.82]How do we make it different?
[31:28.25]You need to, you need to innovate.
[31:30.69]No.
[31:32.98]If I could use the PS4 with the Xbox 360 controller with the Switch mobile capability.
[31:40.49]We're talking seriously, best console ever made.
[31:45.67]PC?
[31:48.99]That is, yeah, that is a laptop.
[31:51.33]Yeah, I'm doing that right now.
[31:52.41]Like, yeah, that's like a nice laptop.
[31:55.25]Nice, get one.
[31:56.37]Wait, wait, wait a second.
[31:57.80]There's gotta be something here.
[32:03.06]I just, like, fucking played myself really bad right there.
[32:08.46]I like the Xbox One controller, but I don't like this.
[32:13.73]I don't like the clicky bumpers.
[32:14.99]In fact, the Xbox... Are they worse on the 360 one?
[32:19.39]Which one's louder?
[32:33.38]Alright, Xbox One controller.
[32:34.42]But, no, but I like the shape of the Xbox 360 controller better.
[32:40.05]What?
[32:40.35]I'm imagining you at a party having this conversation.
[32:44.91]It's like a group of friends standing around, like, having a drink, talking.
[32:47.89]And you're just on this fucking thing on your own and everyone's... What's wrong with that?
[32:52.21]Just watching you.
[32:54.12]What?
[32:54.22]Just watching you trying to figure out which, like, which drink is the loudest.
[32:59.16]Dude.
[33:04.30]Yeah.
[33:07.08]Ashley.
[33:08.00]What?
[33:08.76]There's no way.
[33:09.62]I don't know.
[33:11.06]There's no way.
[33:11.74]I'm coming to these realizations.
[33:13.92]I'm coming to these realizations right now.
[33:16.38]I'm not going to hold on to this for like... I'm going to forget this six hours from now.
[33:19.22]You think I'm going to remember which is a louder click on the bumper?
[33:22.80]Why would I even think about that in six hours?
[33:24.82]He's got to inform you now while it's still in his brain.
[33:27.08]I have to talk for me.
[33:29.06]Hold on.
[33:29.74]There's a badger talking to me.
[33:30.98]Hello?
[33:31.28]Hello?
[33:37.37]Oh, just assume we're heroes?
[33:40.10]Yeah.
[33:40.58]How does he know?
[33:42.94]What the fuck, Xbox?
[33:43.68]Get out of my...
[33:56.71]I had a really funny joke that was right here ready for you.
[33:59.71]I was going to say, I was going to do an Animal Crossing reference.
[34:02.61]Oh my God.
[34:03.01]Okay.
[34:03.21]But which one of these is louder?
[34:04.41]Like if it, is that louder than if it?
[34:06.35]God dang it.
[34:07.25]Which one of these is going to be?
[34:09.01]People were going to laugh.
[34:10.31]It was going to be funny.
[34:11.31]Was it?
[34:14.91]It was going to be really funny.
[34:16.57]I know you were going to laugh.
[34:17.87]Steady up.
[34:19.98]Seriously, where's fucking Doctor Strange?
[34:22.12]Like use that and let's see what it was going to look like.
[34:34.61]Uh, I need to- you need to put- put the box- Alright, wait.
[34:38.10]Let me help you.
[34:39.06]I need her to just stop smashing it!
[34:42.18]How can you not grab the top at this point?
[34:43.94]Put the- We did that- we did that so wrong!
[34:49.67]That was so wrong.
[34:50.53]No, people are saying this is, like, too easy.
[34:52.99]It's because we're, like, skipping the- the 20% of every puzzle.
[34:57.80]No, I wasn't.
[34:58.30]They were just ignoring me.
[34:59.36]I was dropping some real jades.
[35:00.74]Whoa!
[35:03.60]So we launch you and then dash through it?
[35:05.86]I don't know.
[35:09.89]You're going to have to stand on this, freeze this.
[35:12.53]You're going to have to freeze this, not when it's back.
[35:15.01]I didn't mean to.
[35:15.79]I don't think I can unfreeze this.
[35:20.18]Yes, I can.
[35:20.58]Yes, I can.
[35:21.08]Okay.
[35:21.28]And you got...
[35:26.55]No, I was firing another shot because I knew I was going to miss it.
[35:34.34]I didn't want to do that.
[35:35.92]I can't even defend myself.
[35:38.26]Try it again.
[35:38.72]Try it again.
[35:40.70]You're fucking with me?
[35:41.81]Let go.
[35:42.89]No.
[35:47.93]Thank you.
[36:02.73]Alright, I got... There's nothing else up there.
[36:07.96]Don't worry.
[36:08.36]There is.
[36:11.52]Is there?
[36:12.40]There shouldn't be.
[36:14.04]This is a cute little room.
[36:18.91]Oh, that thing.
[36:19.47]You're going to have to freeze that up there, probably.
[36:24.59]Oh, that worked.
[36:28.41]Now, how do you guys do this?
[36:31.21]I think you need a box.
[36:32.01]He gives me a box?
[36:38.11]Oh.
[36:38.85]Uh, just, just come jump on the box.
[36:43.01]When did Trine 3, uh, come out?
[36:46.64]Which one did we play last?
[36:47.56]I looked this up last stream and you yelled at me for, like, looking up when, like, the old Trines came out.
[36:51.64]No, no, no, I mean, like... I don't want to engage in this again.
[36:53.84]Let me, let me have better questions.
[36:55.72]When did, when did you make that video?
[37:01.85]I don't want to engage in this.
[37:05.93]Yeah, I think he's baiting us.
[37:08.28]Yeah.
[37:09.78]Can't say that.
[37:10.60]Alright, unfreeze that, please.
[37:15.40]Refreeze that, please.
[37:34.21]Oh my god!
[37:34.75]Look, it's actually... You switch and you see.
[37:38.08]It's like not... Remember, I'm on analog.
[37:41.50]I haven't gotten digital yet.
[37:42.90]I'm on analog still.
[37:46.30]I'm not on mouse.
[37:48.13]It's not like pinpoint mouse precision.
[37:53.73]I'm on a right analog stick.
[37:56.01]There's a left puzzle if you pull out this thing.
[37:59.69]We need an analog gamer.
[38:01.63]What do you need me to do?
[38:05.93]Ah, forget it.
[38:06.53]Let's go.
[38:08.06]Who needs the bonus things when we have extra points anyway?
[38:15.42]Here we go.
[38:18.38]No!
[38:21.81]No.
[38:23.89]Jerma.
[38:26.62]I had to do it to get you up there.
[38:31.98]No, no.
[38:33.38]Ashley.
[38:34.30]What?
[38:35.04]Over here.
[38:36.04]No, I was trying to get this Jerma blood.
[38:38.96]You got it.
[38:40.31]Oh, there is another Jerma blood.
[38:41.79]I didn't even see that.
[38:42.75]You don't seem to be in trouble.
[38:46.45]Why can't it be your blood?
[38:49.50]You're the one that's bleeding all the time.
[38:51.94]My blood is purple.
[38:52.74]Jump over this.
[38:56.23]Ashley, jump over my box, please.
[38:59.57]Your blood emote.
[39:06.11]Somebody wrote, oh my god, hostile.
[39:09.82]We've been saying this is my blood.
[39:13.08]Well, it started out as virgin blood and then it became your blood.
[39:16.50]That's actually true.
[39:17.46]That's how we came to it.
[39:19.08]Yep.
[39:23.69]Somebody walks up to me on the street with a knife and is like, give me all your money!
[39:26.89]And I go, and I go, hey, get the fuck out of here.
[39:29.95]And the person next to me is gonna go, hey, hostile, easy.
[39:33.27]Ashley's gotta go.
[39:35.18]I gotta go.
[39:37.46]There's a wall break.
[39:40.02]Oh.
[39:42.56]Got it.
[39:44.68]Don't die here?
[39:45.44]Yes!
[39:46.85]Uncalled for.
[39:47.71]Camera, hand over.
[39:50.97]Just give him the money.
[39:52.25]Just give him, just, don't do it.
[39:53.81]Oh, we actually are supposed to do that.
[39:56.33]What?
[39:57.05]Ow.
[39:57.45]I ain't going.
[39:58.61]What?
[40:00.22]There's no way over there.
[40:01.32]There's no, well, why are we, why are we still sitting here?
[40:05.18]She was doing her thing.
[40:05.86]I was coming back with the blood for you.
[40:07.68]Ah.
[40:09.80]Sorry, I was in an argument with myself.
[40:14.40]Not with your tent?
[40:16.18]These balls are really annoying for two people.
[40:19.16]For multiplayer, yeah.
[40:22.66]Here.
[40:23.64]No!
[40:25.50]Here, you wanna touch it?
[40:27.04]Hold it still!
[40:28.02]I hate you!
[40:30.62]Oh.
[40:31.84]She hates streaming.
[40:34.58]No, I hate him!
[40:35.36]I like other streamers, it's just not him.
[40:42.02]Yeah, same.
[40:44.46]You'd be more like...
[40:46.44]Other people.
[40:50.06]Awesome.
[40:54.78]You keep talking shit, it's gonna be your blood in a second.
[40:56.72]Give me a ball.
[40:58.85]Give me a ball.
[40:59.21]You gotta freeze that.
[40:59.85]You gotta freeze it.
[41:00.97]When it's, when it's lined up right.
[41:05.61]Not quite.
[41:06.05]It's gonna be a little higher, I think.
[41:06.97]Oh.
[41:20.93]Yeah, sorry.
[41:21.57]I had to get the, uh... I had to get the Steve blood.
[41:25.67]That's right.
[41:26.25]I'm not using fucking Avatar names anymore.
[41:29.63]Ooooooh.
[41:40.65]That's not Star's blood.
[41:42.25]That's Steve's blood.
[41:45.75]Are you threatening us?
[41:47.12]Something is running.
[41:54.17]Still streamer.
[41:59.53]I don't think you're going to get voted on for the streamies.
[42:02.82]The 2019 streamies.
[42:03.66]You're out.
[42:05.60]Well, it doesn't matter because the same like four people win that every single year since its inception.
[42:09.84]Does it really matter?
[42:11.58]What is the IGN?
[42:15.06]The Game Awards?
[42:15.90]You're not going to be streamer of the year.
[42:18.88]I don't care how much you spend on that carnival.
[42:20.88]It's a Fortnite streamer.
[42:23.41]Can you not die?
[42:25.27]Alright, so here you go.
[42:28.65]I'm gonna freeze it.
[42:32.60]Or, just go.
[42:33.28]What are you doing?
[42:35.22]I mean, you said you were gonna freeze it.
[42:39.98]I mean, I- I like how he feels on my feet.
[42:46.46]I guess we're just gonna... Maybe...
[42:51.33]Freeze it.
[42:52.15]Jesus.
[42:53.23]Well, I figured that... Just, hold on.
[42:59.07]It just... Hold on.
[43:00.89]You gotta pull it up and freeze it.
[43:02.45]Well, get your fucking toys out of the way.
[43:08.17]Fucking god damn, it's fucking analog.
[43:10.34]I'm telling you, everyone thinks I'm insane.
[43:12.34]It's the fucking... It's right analog stick.
[43:14.26]It's more... Stop laughing at me!
[43:17.16]It's not... It wasn't a funny thing.
[43:19.32]It's real.
[43:23.71]It's, fuck, it's, I'm using the right analog stick.
[43:26.17]It's great that you always, you always shoot one too high, then one too low.
[43:29.98]You always find a way to, like, thread the needle perfectly missing.
[43:37.86]I don't typically do that.
[43:39.64]No.
[43:40.18]That looked safe in the middle.
[43:42.82]It does.
[43:43.28]It did?
[43:44.04]Yeah, it looks safe right there.
[43:44.80]There's a spot.
[43:45.48]There's an open spot.
[43:47.42]Do you need our help over there?
[43:48.99]Uh, yeah.
[43:49.69]Jeremy needs to come over.
[43:51.29]Okay.
[43:52.25]Yeah, just make another ball.
[43:53.75]Yeah.
[43:54.35]But I can't- the screen isn't panning, so I don't know what's going on.
[43:57.49]Uh, there is... a little thing.
[44:01.14]Ooh.
[44:01.68]Okay.
[44:01.98]Can you make it?
[44:03.88]I don't know.
[44:04.22]I think we actually- we actually might- whoa.
[44:06.22]Nope.
[44:06.72]Here.
[44:07.18]Just come over and jump on it.
[44:08.52]Can't- yeah, can I do it from there?
[44:09.64]Hold on.
[44:10.64]Yep.
[44:11.14]Yep.
[44:13.28]No!
[44:13.70]I wanted to- Steve!
[44:15.58]Star!
[44:18.72]Wait, I don't even need to... Just get rid of your ball.
[44:23.62]Like that.
[44:25.86]Move your ball.
[44:26.96]Move your box.
[44:29.02]No.
[44:29.94]It's auto-attaching.
[44:33.51]Mine.
[44:34.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:35.55]I ain't dying.
[44:36.71]I ain't dying.
[44:37.47]I ain't dying.
[44:39.31]Oh my god, you made it.
[44:49.51]I'm just gonna have like a 3-2-1 countdown kind of situation.
[44:53.90]You were, weren't you?
[44:56.04]How'd that work out?
[44:56.78]Oh, you hit your head.
[44:57.52]What?
[44:57.76]Alright, when you get up here, I'm gonna drop it, and then we're gonna jump, so we won't hit our heads.
[45:03.23]I'm just gonna go beat the level.
[45:05.37]And then point get up there.
[45:14.14]On your shield?
[45:15.08]Mine.
[45:15.92]I guess I just...
[45:41.44]I mean, I guess?
[45:43.56]To get this stuff.
[45:44.12]I guess.
[45:44.92]Then shield.
[45:45.54]Oh, there's a thing.
[45:51.31]There's another pole thing up here.
[45:53.39]This badger's house is fucking enormous.
[45:56.03]Yeah, it is.
[45:59.07]It's just, what a joke.
[46:02.03]Oh, come into my tree!
[46:05.26]He's very wealthy.
[46:06.44]He laid trap for us ahead of time.
[46:13.13]Yeah, this is just the average house in Trunch.
[46:15.78]Yeah, you would think that if you were living in, like, a tree trunk.
[46:20.44]Shit would be, like, 400 square feet.
[46:24.44]300 square feet, maybe.
[46:25.30]Just think about how far I had to go to get my mail.
[46:28.12]That's true.
[46:30.46]Wait, ma- Is it possible that we're just tiny?
[46:35.03]Like, very small.
[46:36.61]Like, tiny, tiny, tiny.
[46:39.19]That's possible.
[46:39.75]But the bad- No, we're as big as the badger.
[46:42.15]Not me.
[46:43.60]But badgers are tiny.
[46:47.96]How did I not get that?
[46:49.18]I went through the wall.
[46:51.50]There's some down there?
[46:52.70]Yeah.
[46:55.00]Okay.
[46:55.20]I can't go.
[47:09.66]I thought we were going to have to put a rock.
[47:11.10]Oh, there's another one up this way.
[47:12.48]There's the ceiling here, Ashley.
[47:14.36]You got to push it this way.
[47:16.24]I crushed my head into the ceiling.
[47:23.64]Maybe I do need to put a ball on this thing.
[47:26.03]And what, launch the ball up into there?
[47:27.43]It's standing over.
[47:28.21]It's making this very difficult.
[47:37.05]You know, sometimes.
[47:38.97]Just come down here and do it from here.
[47:40.23]You get a nice, like, cup of coffee, and you just play in a game and hang out.
[47:44.75]This is great.
[47:48.05]It's like half the time I don't even have to do anything.
[47:50.83]This is looking fantastic.
[47:54.23]Seriously.
[47:56.69]Where is our coffee?
[47:57.85]It said you'd bring us some.
[48:02.93]This is, this is, I like this.
[48:06.25]See how he ignores us?
[48:07.23]Oops.
[48:07.97]Yeah, but... I think I might... It's a slipper.
[48:13.61]I'm not... ...ignored.
[48:18.38]You, uh... The only problem is now you have to be drinking coffee.
[48:22.60]I don't want to drink it, I just want the pride of him giving it to me.
[48:26.14]You guys don't drink often, right?
[48:27.02]Magic's happening.
[48:27.54]What's... There's some sort of magic here.
[48:31.68]I love coffee.
[48:32.38]I really do.
[48:35.49]Doesn't love you back.
[48:36.57]It's inanimate.
[48:38.75]That's fine.
[48:47.05]It's not fine.
[48:48.25]Alright, on fighting sequences, I'm just gonna go to the mouse.
[48:57.15]Whoa, what's that?
[48:58.97]Oh, there's two balls.
[49:03.00]I can do two conjuries.
[49:04.86]I'm useful.
[49:06.56]Why did you get two upgrades in a row?
[49:08.15]That's stupid.
[49:09.47]How do we get that?
[49:13.49]Steve, help us.
[49:15.19]Oh, you want that?
[49:16.35]Yeah.
[49:16.87]Well, you know what you're going to need then?
[49:19.79]To calm the fuck down.
[49:23.20]You're going to need two boxes.
[49:25.58]We don't need two boxes.
[49:27.28]I know you don't.
[49:27.94]I mean, we need them now.
[49:31.54]Too far.
[49:33.43]No?
[49:34.21]Some of us can do that.
[49:35.11]That's too far for me.
[49:37.49]Perfect for me.
[49:38.87]I'll still make it.
[49:40.67]It was a learning experience.
[49:45.69]Okay.
[49:48.93]Getting real deep in this tree now.
[49:51.16]Yeah.
[49:51.42]I don't think we're in his house anymore.
[49:52.80]I just don't think he has very good security.
[49:57.10]We're in the underworld now.
[49:58.87]We got out of that already.
[49:59.81]What's down here?
[50:00.97]Why is there a thing to drop down?
[50:01.87]I don't know.
[50:03.93]Something down here.
[50:05.97]But what?
[50:08.73]Um... Why would we... Oh, I think you could probably just grapple up to the wall.
[50:15.02]I don't know.
[50:16.02]That's just no other reason for this to be here?
[50:20.06]Oh.
[50:21.02]Oh, shit.
[50:22.62]Ah, there is... Okay.
[50:23.52]There is a reason to be down here.
[50:24.38]This is a secret room.
[50:26.79]But can I do this on my own?
[50:28.51]I don't think I can.
[50:29.71]Maybe I can.
[50:31.37]How did you... No, I don't think I can.
[50:35.27]I think I need a friend over here.
[50:37.67]Well, I fell down the pit twice.
[50:39.43]I didn't see anything to interact with.
[50:41.85]Oh, there is a thing.
[50:42.55]I don't know how we get there.
[50:43.89]I'm gonna have to get you guys.
[50:45.09]Oh, okay.
[50:45.55]I'm here.
[50:45.85]Alright, I got a bridge.
[50:49.72]You're safe.
[50:51.26]Okay.
[50:57.05]We have to do something.
[51:02.46]I think maybe you move that, and then go like that, and then get the, get the Cheshire's Rest.
[51:14.71]And then get the super.
[51:17.49]There we go.
[51:19.85]Nice.
[51:20.11]And I think that does it.
[51:26.67]Oh, there it is.
[51:27.87]Oh, nope.
[51:29.35]There we go.
[51:32.41]There it is.
[51:34.47]Ah, yes, my son.
[51:35.39]Do you need me to get out of here?
[51:37.31]Uh, a little bit.
[51:38.55]Uh, yeah, you do.
[51:39.65]Hold on.
[51:44.39]Oh my god.
[51:47.67]Yes, my son.
[51:49.25]Stop saying that.
[51:50.51]That's my new catchphrase.
[51:55.17]How do we get up here?
[51:56.95]Oh.
[51:58.03]Nope, not like that.
[51:58.85]We have to move this ship.
[52:03.61]Stop making a kaizo block, please.
[52:06.66]Oh, shit.
[52:08.70]Sticky.
[52:11.68]Oh, shit.
[52:15.02]You gonna help, or you're just gonna float that box around?
[52:17.90]I can't see- destroy the box under you.
[52:23.41]Wait, oh.
[52:24.88]Why did I grab the box?
[52:26.77]I was so far away from it.
[52:31.31]Was that a snore?
[52:32.09]Snort of content.
[52:36.39]Well, that worked.
[52:38.47]Okay, well now I need a box.
[52:45.82]Uh-oh, you gave Chad a reason to do ResidentSleeper.
[52:48.12]They've been waiting.
[52:50.02]They've really been waiting.
[52:56.98]I can't jump.
[52:59.00]We're all dead.
[53:00.50]We lost in... Whoa, from the main... Whoa!
[53:03.45]From the main menu.
[53:06.39]No.
[53:08.97]Oh.
[53:12.41]Okay.
[53:13.71]Come on, Rowdy.
[53:14.31]I wish I could use all these skill points.
[53:20.66]We're good.
[53:40.61]Get away from me.
[53:47.27]That works.
[53:47.57]Alright.
[53:48.71]I have two locks here.
[53:49.79]I have a frozen lock.
[53:52.43]And I have a fire lock.
[53:55.61]That doesn't mean anything.
[53:59.45]Holy shit, that was actually kind of scary.
[54:02.85]There's another wall over here.
[54:04.01]I need a ball.
[54:05.15]I need to launch that one up here somehow.
[54:08.87]How do we open this door, though?
[54:13.59]behind this wall there's an ice key to the left I think you might need to make a rope bridge for me to put a ball on either that or this ball will knock another ball forward I mean I don't think I can place balls on ropes oh I can oh you can so I guess that is what you do
[54:40.40]so then now how do we push the key like oh I can pick up this one how do you oh you can pick them up they're can't put down sword see
[55:06.65]Hello?
[55:07.45]Well, you don't try it.
[55:08.45]You try and do it.
[55:09.15]What do you mean you try and do it?
[55:10.43]Beg me.
[55:11.63]Beg me.
[55:18.02]There's no begging.
[55:18.92]Someone say something nice about me.
[55:22.56]Put that key in that slot or you're going to have an incredibly angry fucking person here.
[55:28.32]Put it in your slot.
[55:29.42]Okay, this joke is going.
[55:32.65]No one, like even when threatened, I'm...
[55:37.71]You are a fucking idiot.
[55:40.93]You know how you do that?
[55:41.55]How to earn a compliment?
[55:42.81]Give you money.
[56:01.47]Okay.
[56:01.99]Now... So, freeze it when it gets... Let's weigh it down.
[56:05.22]Freeze it.
[56:06.26]Well, you need to break the ceiling.
[56:09.10]So, I think you need to make another rope that angles up.
[56:12.88]To launch a ball up.
[56:15.80]I can't attach it to anything, though.
[56:16.86]Unless you put, like, a ball over here.
[56:18.52]Can you attach it to that bar?
[56:19.96]Or no?
[56:20.72]No.
[56:21.68]I can attach it to, like, a... To that.
[56:23.04]That doesn't look janky at all.
[56:27.71]It's pretty janky, but it'll probably work.
[56:33.75]Will it work?
[56:38.79]Just keep doing it, it'll happen.
[56:40.19]I think, yeah, no, eventually it's gonna... Whoa, what?
[56:43.92]Okay.
[56:46.84]That what?
[56:48.06]I did not make another ball.
[56:51.32]We need to, yeah, yeah, we might need to swing the ball around the left one.
[57:00.93]Oh, that looks more reasonable.
[57:02.06]We need to attach that to the ball.
[57:04.24]Yeah.
[57:07.30]So now you swing it like a pendulum.
[57:10.30]Yeah.
[57:11.72]Dude, the three trainers knew that.
[57:14.40]That was fun.
[57:15.02]Nope.
[57:22.90]Oh.
[57:24.36]Okay.
[57:24.56]Alright, bring this, weigh this down.
[57:27.23]Can I just make a box every once in a while?
[57:29.89]We did it the right way, the way the game makers intended.
[57:37.30]Nice.
[57:39.94]What just happened?
[57:42.74]You got hurt on these.
[57:44.56]Oh, hold on.
[57:45.02]Let me freeze this.
[57:45.72]Get over here.
[57:46.93]Yeah, just weigh it down.
[57:52.07]That one actually went through.
[57:53.37]It went through.
[57:54.17]I mean, we could push that, the whole, like, Jeremy can't aim with the analog, but I mean, that went through.
[58:00.07]It did.
[58:00.57]Everybody knows that's what happened.
[58:15.60]DPS!
[58:18.46]Watch out!
[58:20.52]Woah, that's bouncing.
[58:23.63]Okay.
[58:23.75]I think we just have to go up in waves?
[58:27.57]Nah, let me shoot that.
[58:30.11]Okay, wait, we have his journal.
[58:31.37]Why don't we just go back?
[58:33.71]What do you mean, go back?
[58:35.59]I mean, like, we got the badger's journal and he was at the entrance.
[58:39.71]So why are we continuing to walk forward?
[58:46.39]You only go right in this game.
[58:48.49]I mean, that's what I'm getting at.
[58:50.73]You do only go right, but it's part of the game.
[59:01.80]Follow me!
[59:03.58]If we keep going forward, we're gonna find, like, his other, like, less-safe-for-work journal.
[59:08.98]Yeah, secret diary.
[59:11.02]We got a ceiling to break over here.
[59:12.40]We do have a ceiling to break.
[59:14.12]So... I don't think even... Well, you can... No, the other way.
[59:19.38]I should've hid it.
[59:21.12]There's... It's not... There's nothing to hid over there.
[59:23.94]Well, I mean, there's that.
[59:24.58]You get that.
[59:24.98]There's purple stuff.
[59:27.40]How come I'm not on the Diablo II Paladin Scepter guy?
[59:32.42]Because I... That takes... That takes a lot more skill than shoot bow.
[59:40.81]Alright.
[59:41.37]Push this way.
[59:43.21]So I can get this.
[59:44.78]Or... Never mind.
[59:45.98]See?
[59:46.18]That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[59:47.30]Like, I... That's what I mean.
[59:54.84]It feels like every time I reach for the jump button, there's always instantly a box over my head.
[59:59.12]I think we have to move this.
[60:00.16]Dude, I keep trying to make boxes in the spot to help people jump, and then you just keep, like, going, like, mashing on it, like I'm twirling 720s.
[60:08.70]Why did that just stop?
[60:10.66]Yeah, we need to move this.
[60:12.24]No, we don't.
[60:13.10]But I want to do it like that, because I want to play the game the way that we did originally.
[60:17.34]Alright, just box, speed jump.
[60:28.00]Let me box you.
[60:28.94]Uh-oh, that wolf's wearing clothes.
[60:33.69]He's a furry.
[60:34.53]What is wrong?
[60:38.89]What is wrong with you?
[60:41.79]Why can't I grab this?
[60:45.46]There has to be a reason.
[60:48.02]Question is, should you?
[60:48.88]Can I freeze this thing?
[60:54.20]I can freeze that one.
[60:57.83]Fuck your box.
[61:03.42]I think, yeah, we can just jump up there.
[61:09.20]Why did you break my ice?
[61:09.96]Oh, I think the other thing did.
[61:14.06]The other, yeah.
[61:14.94]Oh.
[61:17.25]Shit.
[61:17.51]Can you, you want to freeze the other one again?
[61:20.27]Yes, please.
[61:28.04]Okay, I didn't need you to.
[61:33.58]Why did you do... Get the ball out of the way.
[61:35.82]Get the ball out of the way.
[61:36.66]Okay.
[61:42.06]Okay.
[61:52.19]What's up here?
[61:55.03]Uh, gems.
[61:56.05]And... Gems?
[61:58.45]Gems.
[61:59.65]Gems and jams?
[62:02.07]Oh, no.
[62:02.74]I can't get this without a super help.
[62:06.26]Okay, somebody has to come up here.
[62:07.58]There's a big one up here, and I can't get it on my own.
[62:10.90]Unless can I, like, jump on this twice?
[62:12.76]No.
[62:15.79]Okay, this one's hard.
[62:16.75]This is... Okay.
[62:17.81]Okay.
[62:18.29]Okay.
[62:20.03]Got the jewel.
[62:21.99]But, I can't get the thing that's over here.
[62:26.20]You just wait there, Shlee.
[62:30.08]Oh, this guy needs boxes.
[62:31.88]He needed boxes.
[62:34.50]I did, and I appreciate the help.
[62:41.48]I need boxes.
[62:44.72]Take another one of those.
[62:48.70]I needed boxes!
[62:49.51]You have too much power.
[62:51.33]Respect the wizard.
[62:52.15]I think it's time to switch Steve off the wizard.
[62:54.39]What do you guys think?
[62:56.78]Respect to the wizard.
[62:59.12]Or you get the horns.
[63:06.46]Don't you do it.
[63:08.27]Your character was standing there doing a thing, and I knew it.
[63:11.89]I knew it.
[63:13.53]The way you were standing still.
[63:15.55]Alright, hold on.
[63:24.50]Who would build, like, what is the point of building this?
[63:26.71]I'm sorry.
[63:27.57]Is that enough?
[63:30.59]We're gonna put our keggers on the ends of these planks.
[63:35.74]Can you get up there?
[63:36.34]Because I can give you... Oh, I could in a second if someone gave me a box.
[63:41.02]because I can... Can you grab the edge if it's slippery?
[63:45.42]I'll just do this.
[63:45.86]No, you should not.
[63:47.06]Hold on.
[63:47.38]He's... He's trying to be funny.
[63:51.12]I was... What?
[63:51.76]That was pure help.
[63:52.88]Oh, you were trying.
[63:53.70]Also, you guys overthunk the shit out of that.
[63:55.56]The first time you froze it, you could just jump up.
[63:59.20]You want to talk about overthunkers?
[64:00.66]We overthunk.
[64:02.48]Don't you mean we were overthinking it?
[64:04.82]No.
[64:05.20]Whoa.
[64:08.56]Hey, how many of those drinks did you drunk, by the way?
[64:11.60]God.
[64:13.66]Yeah.
[64:14.20]Well, I didn't overdrunk them like you did.
[64:16.16]Are you gonna be nice so I can put this key in again?
[64:20.26]We weren't nice the first time.
[64:25.98]I think I'm actually gonna make a stand this time.
[64:28.92]You're gonna... Come on.
[64:36.55]at the other key Ashley it's the rope for this is too long watch so yeah that's true I'll do it there okay now say something nice one for each key draw your first okay something nice about what you about me
[65:04.83]You're very good at going through things very fast without doing them the way they're supposed to be done, and you do them very quickly, and it kind of ruins the game, but you do very well going fast.
[65:18.10]Okay.
[65:19.54]Now, Ashley.
[65:22.44]Oh, I like your haircut.
[65:30.39]So hard.
[65:30.77]It was that easy.
[65:33.84]Little does he know.
[65:39.82]This is too positive.
[65:40.79]Where's the negativity?
[65:41.83]I had to explain to my parents what a zoomer haircut meant.
[65:47.61]So we were still in his house.
[65:48.59]Hmm.
[66:02.88]I think the Nightmare Prince went his way.
[66:11.28]The heroes continued their pursuit of the Nightmare Prince, but the trail was growing cold.
[66:17.39]Crickets.
[66:18.25]Okay, okay.
[66:20.15]So the Nightmare Prince who summons wolves, the first place he ran to was a badger.
[66:24.49]And now this looks like a porcupine.
[66:27.85]100% Nightmare Prince is a furry.
[66:30.13]No, he's afraid of furries.
[66:32.44]And that's why he's tormenting them.
[66:33.68]Right?
[66:35.74]He didn't break it?
[66:40.72]Why does... Why that other... Why the first... The second one didn't break it?
[66:43.33]What?
[66:46.05]Can you stop saying the word furry?
[66:48.39]Furry.
[66:48.89]Furry.
[66:49.63]What happened to Hillary's furries?
[66:54.87]It's growing!
[66:55.61]Constant conflict.
[66:56.83]I think I killed it.
[66:57.77]No.
[67:03.29]Can we save fuzzies?
[67:15.56]How about fluffies?
[67:16.92]I'm just saying that, I'm trying to figure out the lore, so we're not, we're not direct of water.
[67:22.64]We gotta rope it.
[67:25.80]Wait, no you don't.
[67:27.08]Where are we?
[67:27.64]In the, the flower.
[67:28.96]In this plate.
[67:29.64]Oh.
[67:31.03]Here.
[67:33.24]You're missing most of them.
[67:40.14]Just rope the water.
[67:49.26]Jerma is fucking weird.
[67:52.68]What?
[67:53.34]I haven't done... I've just been... What did I do?
[68:03.41]More about what you have inhibitions of doing.
[68:07.83]I'm just hanging out, man.
[68:09.59]I'm just saying that they're very specifically not scalies.
[68:13.14]Like, they all... Okay, I'm the weird one.
[68:16.06]You've been talking about furries for 20 minutes.
[68:18.82]And I'm the weird one today.
[68:21.88]I mean, we haven't gone into detail, but we could.
[68:27.53]You ever read Redwall?
[68:31.62]It was like the furry starter kit.
[68:36.87]He's so... What do you mean?
[68:39.03]No, I can't say that because that means I am.
[68:41.67]What?
[68:42.41]No, it's a chat thing.
[68:44.01]Someone's saying something in chat.
[68:44.87]I can't... If I say I'm not, then I am.
[68:47.75]So I'm not going to say it.
[68:48.99]If I say I'm not, then I am.
[68:51.55]No, mad.
[68:52.79]The word is mad.
[68:53.85]Not what you... No.
[68:55.43]Mad.
[68:56.09]Not the other one.
[68:58.63]Uh, Ashley, can you put in the point to the double shield thing or something?
[69:02.80]I cannot.
[69:03.32]It's still locked.
[69:06.90]Okay, then, okay, you just need to come stand down here and I need to move the boxes.
[69:11.30]Who cares anyways?
[69:20.75]Jerma is molding?
[69:23.13]What does that mean?
[69:23.91]It's like, I don't know.
[69:24.75]It's like, you're so bald you're mad, or you're so mad that you're bald.
[69:28.49]It's, I don't know.
[69:29.61]I've been trying to figure it out.
[69:30.59]I've actually been trying to figure this out.
[69:33.30]It's like a new thing.
[69:38.20]Clearly it has a kernel of truth because it's getting to you.
[69:42.70]Oh, well, no, we'll see.
[69:43.74]We'll see in, like, 10 to 15 years.
[69:47.24]When all you guys are starting to lose your fucking hair a little.
[69:50.04]And then you remember back when you... I just almost killed that motherfucker.
[69:55.21]You remember back when you were saying all the bald shit.
[69:58.39]And you're gonna be like, ah, fuck.
[70:00.11]I'm going bald, too.
[70:02.33]Because in a couple years, you're actually going to be bald.
[70:04.47]No, I'm not.
[70:06.15]Yeah, you're gonna be bolder than us still.
[70:07.87]I am not.
[70:08.11]You're still going to be bolder.
[70:10.85]Where is this coming from?
[70:12.19]We're not going to equalize in age.
[70:13.91]This is the point when I get up from the chair and I go look in the mirror and I go, Jeremy, this is on purpose.
[70:19.10]You're going to be fine.
[70:20.18]They're just fucking with you.
[70:21.52]Everyone's just messing with you.
[70:22.40]You're going to be fine.
[70:23.30]And then I come back and sit back down.
[70:27.06]But you didn't do that.
[70:28.28]No, that's why.
[70:29.24]It's tough.
[70:33.26]Wait, you guys didn't go left.
[70:37.39]What's this here for?
[70:38.47]I was up here.
[70:39.41]Oh, you were?
[70:40.11]There were things up.
[70:40.87]I got the juices.
[70:47.63]Ooh, pumping water.
[70:48.33]Cool.
[70:51.35]Can we put a box right there, please?
[70:55.98]Here we go.
[70:56.46]What the fuck?
[71:01.04]Um, plant's over here, so let's...
[71:07.96]Uh, I can maybe put a second box there?
[71:09.84]Oh, no, it's working.
[71:11.26]Okay.
[71:21.62]Wait!
[71:23.44]Uh-huh.
[71:27.97]Oh, secret room.
[71:29.05]Secret room.
[71:31.97]Uh, double secret room.
[71:34.79]Is there a triple secret room?
[71:36.41]Triple secret room.
[71:44.23]It's my real hair.
[71:45.29]I can do with it what I want.
[71:46.63]It's my real hair.
[71:52.87]Hell, they're always in a swimming pool.
[71:54.59]They're always like, look at me, I'm in the swimming pool.
[71:58.84]That's like when you can't hide your baldness.
[72:01.42]Your hair's all wet.
[72:02.28]You just don't go under.
[72:05.28]Pontius now has the dream shield.
[72:08.36]Hold up shield and hit.
[72:16.29]Now your shield can dream.
[72:17.71]Anything else over here?
[72:23.25]Did I learn anything new?
[72:24.63]Nope.
[72:26.65]You have two shields?
[72:28.49]You got a double bounce.
[72:29.53]Take care about my shield really hard.
[72:31.83]Nice.
[72:46.33]This Pontius just walks around thinking about it.
[72:48.53]It does.
[72:48.75]Gotta get it.
[72:49.35]No.
[72:49.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[72:50.67]I can't wait.
[72:52.43]I can't wait for like, in like 10 years.
[73:06.04]Somebody just wrote, and I'm gonna make a reference to this.
[73:09.10]So you know like they said like five to ten years ago, don't put dumb shit on Facebook.
[73:14.02]Don't put it, because like what if you go to a job interview and they see it, right?
[73:16.59]That was like the thing they told us like ten years ago.
[73:20.23]In Twitch chat now, somebody just wrote, I can't stop farting.
[73:25.43]Your boss in ten years is gonna see that.
[73:27.89]Just to make sure I let you know.
[73:29.95]So, careful.
[73:32.11]Yeah, he will.
[73:37.94]No one wants a gasser.
[73:39.08]What do you mean, how?
[73:43.52]I'll say it on the record, there's times that I can't stop farting.
[73:49.51]No matter what.
[73:53.57]And Ashley got hired.
[73:54.69]I did.
[74:00.38]So you two... Yeah, I'm talking 10 years from now.
[74:05.03]They're going to know when you were scratching your ass last, alright?
[74:13.59]I'm a gasser.
[74:16.87]You got to pull that off and link up.
[74:21.50]I did see a story really recently about a guy that had done this really amazing charity thing, raised like $200,000, got his name on a beer can for this charity.
[74:31.19]Then they found, like, two tweets from eight years ago, and, like, everyone took their money back.
[74:36.55]Oh, shit.
[74:39.30]What a good thing we raised money for.
[74:41.22]Dude.
[74:44.98]But they, like, put his face on, like, a beer can or something.
[74:48.98]And the beer guy didn't want that tweet guy on the beer can.
[74:52.96]So watch those farts, guys.
[74:55.58]Don't talk about them.
[74:58.30]Farts are fine.
[74:59.02]That's what I've been saying.
[75:04.89]What do we do here?
[75:05.77]Yeah, we gotta get the light.
[75:07.25]I think, I think, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[75:09.65]Two shields, right?
[75:10.25]Get off the boxes!
[75:10.99]Get off the boxes!
[75:11.83]Come over here.
[75:14.79]Now, Ashley, stand on the boxes and dream shield it down.
[75:18.61]Down?
[75:19.43]Down.
[75:21.05]Yeah.
[75:22.71]And now you dream shield it forward.
[75:23.84]What would you do without me?
[75:28.16]Chat won't, moving so fast, my boss won't see this Jerm as a furry.
[75:31.90]In ten years, your boss is going to go, who the fuck is Jerma?
[75:35.68]Is this somebody that you made up in your mind?
[75:37.30]Is this supposed to be you?
[75:41.21]I see, also, you, 285 times over the course of six months, you wrote bald idiot.
[75:50.56]Who's that a reference to?
[75:52.46]Who was the bald idiot?
[75:53.63]Who's this?
[75:54.01]I don't understand this.
[75:54.93]Who was that?
[75:55.35]What's it for?
[75:56.09]Oh, we're looking for flowers.
[75:58.79]Okay.
[76:09.01]Where's flowers?
[76:10.91]And then he... You look at his head, and it's like, there's a fucking giant M receding hairline on his head.
[76:19.54]I just... What's that?
[76:20.34]Was that funny?
[76:21.74]Is there something funny there?
[76:23.24]You're gonna have to dream shield over to the box.
[76:27.55]I think.
[76:30.63]The plant is in that wall on the right.
[76:34.75]So you need to dream shield towards the box so you can second shield it into the wall.
[76:39.05]I don't think I can use the dream shield thing when I'm moving though.
[76:41.77]My father was the baldest man on Earth and he created this company.
[76:48.11]Think I'm gonna let that fly?
[76:49.11]Yeah, I'm like hitting F and nothing's happening.
[76:53.69]Oh.
[76:56.27]Can you make a box like right here so I don't bounce or no?
[76:59.83]Just keep doing that.
[77:00.67]I mean it's hitting the plant.
[77:01.81]Is it hitting it?
[77:03.63]This is stupid.
[77:04.41]I feel embarrassed.
[77:05.61]Look how dumb I look.
[77:09.98]I'm a fucking warrior.
[77:11.06]This is cool.
[77:13.24]I feel like I should be able to grab a... No, wait, I can grab and make a line.
[77:19.83]Yeah, you can make a rope across.
[77:21.43]This is what they want.
[77:23.35]But I can't move it when it's roped and people are jumping on it and it's flying into the sky.
[77:27.23]So you're talking about like bang bang.
[77:32.03]There we go.
[77:34.07]Is it not good enough?
[77:35.65]There it is.
[77:42.52]Come on, whatever.
[77:50.84]Hey, future boss, I want to go to Chili's at 3 today.
[77:54.18]Well, what if you turn out to be, like, people dig up things you said from- Ew, ew, Chili's is disgusting.
[78:01.34]And you are determined to be a bad person, so in the future, when your boss sees that in the past, the current employee called you bald, they're happy that they made fun of you because in the future, you're bad.
[78:13.19]Yeah, what if you go to jail forever for, like, murder?
[78:15.57]There was a Bruce Willis movie about this already.
[78:18.24]Next.
[78:18.56]About people getting promoted for making fun of Bruce Willis?
[78:25.72]I don't know, maybe.
[78:39.09]Uh, I need to... Hold on.
[78:42.96]I need to move this to here.
[78:44.78]No, I thought I had to.
[78:49.77]And then that means we can go like this.
[78:52.03]And then we can box it up.
[78:52.97]What the fuck is going on here?
[79:09.16]Whoa, don't even need it.
[79:09.90]Wait.
[79:10.42]Wait a minute.
[79:13.12]You have a minute.
[79:16.31]That's cool.
[79:20.09]I want to be able to make the plank.
[79:22.75]Oh, come on now.
[79:24.09]You did forget a spell in your old age.
[79:26.40]Ooh, I do have.
[79:26.96]Do I have one?
[79:28.68]No.
[79:28.92]What the fuck?
[79:31.76]Why does the archer get less shit than everybody else?
[79:34.86]Hey.
[79:35.50]Hey, archer.
[79:36.62]Come to useful.
[79:37.33]What's up?
[79:44.74]Here's the hook below you.
[79:56.71]You can solve problems in like seven different ways and you're mad that you don't have enough things.
[80:02.49]Stop.
[80:07.54]Molding.
[80:08.26]Because molding.
[80:09.36]Stop.
[80:09.84]You're giving them strength.
[80:12.72]I like that.
[80:14.74]Alright.
[80:23.08]Break this.
[80:23.88]Okay, we're gonna find out that these are the Nightmare Prince's parents.
[80:28.53]What, these barrels?
[80:29.77]No, the badger and the... The hedgehog?
[80:34.27]Yeah.
[80:36.64]That would be stupid.
[80:45.27]Okay, do you want to play the wizard?
[80:46.63]You know how annoying it is to try and make boxes where people need them, but they stand where they want them?
[80:53.21]Bald.
[80:53.83]You must be bald.
[80:57.61]You need me to move these?
[80:59.67]Do you need another compliment?
[81:03.58]Yeah.
[81:05.06]I'll move it.
[81:05.70]I can do it.
[81:09.54]You got a dream shield.
[81:11.22]The fucking light.
[81:14.40]What light?
[81:14.82]Where is it?
[81:15.80]On the right.
[81:16.38]Oh, God.
[81:22.79]The box is in the way.
[81:23.91]I got it.
[81:24.25]Just do it straight forward.
[81:26.57]What?
[81:27.19]What was that?
[81:27.77]Why did that happen?
[81:28.49]That's pretty weird.
[81:32.11]Don't stop.
[81:32.91]There you go.
[81:37.39]dice on the dashboard.
[81:44.44]You almost got it.
[81:46.12]You aimed it too high up.
[81:47.26]You're such a fool.
[81:49.06]No, look, it worked.
[81:51.54]Oh, look.
[81:52.40]You got the prize.
[81:56.81]I've never been happy.
[82:00.53]I wake up with tears already in my eyes.
[82:02.69]What the fuck?
[82:07.96]I have to wash the bedding.
[82:09.74]Every day.
[82:10.94]Keeps crying in it.
[82:16.13]Okay, so, let me, uh, where's the water?
[82:20.07]Oh, I don't need water.
[82:21.41]Double shield here, and then you stand on my thing.
[82:25.61]Daddy, up!
[82:28.03]Daddy!
[82:29.67]Daddy, up me!
[82:31.19]Daddy, look!
[82:32.56]Steve!
[82:38.40]And then I need to, uh... You can't do it that way, dude.
[82:42.60]Well, I... What was... Here, can you... Can you stand on that?
[82:46.82]Uh... I guess you need to bounce... You need to do double shield, don't you?
[82:59.71]This isn't working.
[83:00.61]Double shield.
[83:02.07]It would work.
[83:04.29]Look, if you just hang a box from the ceiling...
[83:08.26]I think like I gotta get like there you go there how can you get up here we might need a ball yeah do that yeah I need something to jump on
[83:37.72]Every time I look over here, there's something else that I just see, and I'm just like, I turn back.
[83:45.78]My China's upset about double shield meta.
[83:48.92]What?
[83:49.52]Why?
[83:50.00]Because we were like, cheating it before.
[83:55.24]No, it's a reference to a game of mine.
[83:59.03]Oh.
[84:00.91]Ooh, bounce!
[84:02.35]No!
[84:02.93]That is not connected.
[84:05.15]It looks like it is, but it's not.
[84:06.21]That is not connected.
[84:09.62]Am I near enough to jump over it?
[84:12.26]What did it say?
[84:13.62]Do I even need to say it?
[84:14.76]Alright, now I... I'm gonna go like this.
[84:26.43]Dude, you're so good.
[84:27.25]Thanks.
[84:38.63]Dude, you're so good.
[84:39.29]Go!
[84:40.09]You're so good.
[84:47.70]Why doesn't someone build a road?
[84:50.54]I know, really.
[84:51.15]Uh, I think we... We're gonna need some boxes.
[85:01.65]I'm doing this to, like, pretend like I'm trying to play.
[85:03.77]Wow, that actually worked!
[85:05.14]Brilliant.
[85:05.36]I'm, like, trying to get, like, uh, maybe if I hit it with my arrow, I'm secretly trying to hit it in the fucking head.
[85:18.08]Shitbox.
[85:22.26]Oh, remember?
[85:22.92]You last turn had, like, the fish level.
[85:25.84]Didn't it?
[85:26.28]It was a big ol' mean fishy.
[85:29.47]Was there?
[85:30.88]I don't think we ever completed the last one, did we?
[85:34.52]I don't think we did.
[85:35.32]I don't think so.
[85:36.20]We played it for like three and a half hours tops.
[85:41.47]Hey, there's a big nut up here.
[85:45.05]Hold on.
[85:45.53]Big nut.
[85:46.99]I'm waiting for you to get that shit out of here so I can pull this.
[85:52.55]Never mind.
[85:52.93]I don't even need you to do that.
[85:58.62]Big nut!
[85:59.32]Ooh, that's gonna fall.
[86:01.48]That was a lot less dangerous than I thought it was gonna be.
[86:16.40]Light.
[86:18.32]Uh-huh.
[86:26.59]I don't know how you don't block that.
[86:29.79]Uh... Stand on a box?
[86:32.45]Like... But then the box will block it.
[86:37.03]Uh... Um... I... Can you... Okay, now... Yeah, do that, and then stand... Then make a box, like, here.
[86:45.40]Do it.
[86:49.75]And then stand in the box and make it so it doesn't block the light.
[86:53.63]I can get it in a position where you can do it.
[86:58.73]Like this.
[86:59.27]There's no hooks or anything.
[87:02.41]Oh.
[87:03.11]I thought it was secure.
[87:06.27]Good intention.
[87:07.17]Hey, there it is.
[87:08.53]Almost.
[87:08.93]Just move these forward.
[87:09.71]I don't think so.
[87:11.53]No.
[87:13.39]No.
[87:16.61]Speak up.
[87:17.57]Why am I being a little quiet today?
[87:22.53]I don't think... I can't... Wait, hold on a second.
[87:24.65]I think... Can this be used for anything?
[87:39.88]No.
[87:40.26]If it bounces that well, I mean, you have to stand here somehow.
[87:45.50]I think I know.
[87:46.24]I think I know.
[87:46.66]I think I know.
[87:47.08]I think I know.
[87:47.50]I got it.
[87:47.86]Okay.
[87:48.51]okay hold on hold on brain brain is going maximum capacity you need to make a dream shield you need okay get off the box you need to make a dream shield while standing on top of this that's pointing at the the flower right now
[88:10.50]And now you need to get down and shoot it at the dream shield.
[88:13.88]Nice.
[88:14.13]Wow.
[88:14.25]Nice.
[88:14.57]Amazing.
[88:15.65]Awesome.
[88:16.51]That's cool.
[88:17.85]Pretty cool.
[88:33.53]I think if you stick something to that... Oh, never mind.
[88:38.03]I think I can just get this one now.
[88:41.39]Oh, I didn't see the... I didn't see it up there.
[88:45.00]Oh, I can unfreeze with my butt.
[88:46.90]Oh, damn it.
[88:50.26]Yep.
[88:51.62]Got it.
[88:53.14]You know everything is solved with boxes.
[88:56.16]What just happened to me?
[89:02.80]Oh, sorry.
[89:08.90]I did that on purpose because I wanted this to explode.
[89:11.80]Why are you pushing that?
[89:15.99]What's my favorite part?
[89:18.43]Box on head or pre-recorded.
[89:19.55]Hurry up and do it.
[89:20.03]Pre-recorded.
[89:24.43]What's he doing with that big toothbrush?
[89:26.15]This is too kind.
[89:27.88]I can never thank you enough.
[89:32.98]If you are looking for the Nightmare Prince, I think he was headed towards the Northern Lakes.
[89:46.17]We didn't have to help these people at all, by the way.
[89:48.57]No, we didn't.
[89:48.89]The heroes took the hedgehog's advice and followed a path leading to them.
[89:53.15]Yep.
[89:53.89]We could have been much faster if we just beat it out of them.
[89:59.10]Alright.
[90:03.78]Swim level, wee!
[90:06.18]Oh my god, it's swim level.
[90:07.70]Wait, it actually is a- Dude, Ashley!
[90:10.78]This thing looks like you!
[90:12.02]No, no, it's Otto!
[90:13.06]Where?
[90:13.38]It's Otto.
[90:14.48]Fuck you, dude!
[90:30.05]What are you getting, Kyle?
[90:31.71]Oh.
[90:32.11]I gotta do like, I gotta like, make a signature.
[90:38.03]Oh, yeah.
[90:41.38]Break it.
[90:43.00]Snap it.
[90:43.44]Ah, that's a big nut.
[90:45.12]Ooh!
[90:55.65]Does it have to be an acorn?
[90:57.47]Use the fire arrow to activate fire switches.
[91:02.19]So it stays.
[91:09.10]It's not like the freezing arrows.
[91:14.44]Excuse me!
[91:16.62]Uh, fire into the water?
[91:17.86]Uh-oh.
[91:18.66]Oh, you gotta drain!
[91:22.37]Flash is killing it.
[91:26.72]She wants you to have more water.
[91:34.50]Still can't upgrade anything.
[91:37.24]Oh!
[91:37.90]Oh!
[91:38.28]Oh, you can bounce on it!
[91:39.58]And it loves it!
[91:40.78]Oh, it loves it.
[91:42.54]Oh, let's pound it.
[91:49.83]Best part of the game.
[91:50.83]This thing's brand new.
[91:51.97]Dumbass.
[91:52.59]Dumb.
[91:52.81]What?
[91:53.09]What the fuck did you just say?
[91:54.85]I said got him.
[92:25.68]Alright, fire has been activated.
[92:28.56]Now we swim through this.
[92:30.00]What a stupid swim.
[92:35.26]Alright, how do you do that?
[92:38.25]Through the tunnel.
[92:42.01]Got it.
[92:49.41]Look at ice platform.
[92:53.66]Thank you.
[92:54.20]Oh yeah, he can do that!
[92:55.72]I haven't had to do that move in, like, six hours of gameplay, so I forgot I even could do that, really.
[93:02.11]I remember.
[93:02.57]Oh yeah, he can do that!
[93:12.37]He can also roll if he hasn't done it.
[93:15.95]You just walk forward so you don't step on the plate.
[93:22.76]Almost!
[93:25.73]Okay, ball, one, two, help.
[93:33.22]Good.
[93:48.20]Fight.
[93:54.76]DPS him.
[94:00.90]This keeps making me thirsty.
[94:04.26]Hold on.
[94:04.66]Can I just do it?
[94:09.42]I don't think so.
[94:13.19]Water into the wheel.
[94:14.15]Water into the wheel.
[94:15.19]Water into the wheel.
[94:15.87]I was looking for a flower.
[94:37.86]It was a mermaid!
[94:40.40]Oh, I wanna fuck!
[94:44.16]Come fuck.
[94:50.60]I don't see what's going on.
[94:52.09]It was like in the foreground, it swam away real fast.
[94:55.49]Alright, fire over there.
[94:58.79]Ice block.
[95:00.75]Can I switch abilities?
[95:03.25]Before I get screamed at?
[95:08.11]You can make that shot.
[95:09.52]It's kind of hard because I have to hold... I got it.
[95:13.06]I have to hold the right thumb thick.
[95:14.74]The right thumb stick.
[95:25.83]The right thumbtack.
[95:26.91]Just come pound us.
[95:28.45]I will.
[95:28.97]Let me get the pinecone on here.
[95:32.67]Please?
[95:34.25]He doesn't want to do it the right way.
[95:35.77]He wants to do it the fast way.
[95:40.06]I am the person who can lift these things and you keep fucking jumping on it.
[95:43.90]I didn't do anything.
[95:45.52]I'm pounding.
[95:50.96]Now he wants to do two boxes.
[95:53.44]I've seen this schtick before.
[95:55.08]He wants two boxes over here for you to jump on and skip the whole level.
[96:01.35]Oh, it didn't work.
[96:08.67]I'm angry.
[96:09.43]I'm not even close to his balls.
[96:11.45]I'm still mad.
[96:13.67]Imagine how mad he is.
[96:16.76]I actually may have more hair than you.
[96:21.27]What?
[96:22.81]Oh, we're going on a hair-off.
[96:25.29]My hair's higher quality.
[96:26.93]I think it's higher to the ceiling, too.
[96:33.23]True.
[96:34.78]Let's go to a hair salon and determine who has higher quality hair.
[96:38.52]Okay.
[96:40.10]I've been told I've got some fucking high quality hair.
[96:44.02]By who?
[96:44.74]Your mom?
[96:46.76]Yeah, my mother said that.
[96:49.97]Can you help me here?
[96:50.80]Sounds like a mom compliment to me.
[96:53.30]Will you put like a block on this?
[96:55.02]Hey!
[96:56.96]It's not my fault my blocks don't weigh enough to satisfy you.
[97:02.64]Wait a minute.
[97:03.08]Damn it.
[97:12.03]Oh my god.
[97:12.49]If you're going to bring leg hair into this.
[97:16.88]Hey, hello?
[97:17.44]I don't know.
[97:18.42]Your legs are kind of scarred up, and when you have scars, you don't grow hair.
[97:21.64]Yeah, but the rest of my leg makes up, like, I could probably make three sets of Jerma's hair with a leg.
[97:28.95]Well, it's because your legs are so much longer than his.
[97:35.85]Okay.
[97:39.40]I mean, Jerma, honestly, we were both able to do this.
[97:42.18]Yeah, because you're putting boxes down, and you're talking about leg hair.
[97:46.16]We get it.
[97:46.58]You got gross leg hair.
[97:47.91]I do.
[97:49.55]And more of it.
[97:57.87]Right in the car.
[98:00.15]Uh-oh, water puzzle.
[98:01.67]Because everyone loves water levels.
[98:05.00]You know what I'm saying?
[98:07.66]I'm working.
[98:11.10]I can pull it down.
[98:16.58]Stand on it?
[98:20.30]Oops.
[98:20.58]I gotta freeze it.
[98:27.88]I gotta freeze it.
[98:28.40]I gotta freeze it.
[98:29.14]Hold on.
[98:32.47]Oh, you fucking motherfucker.
[98:37.81]Isn't that what we need?
[98:39.85]Didn't we do it?
[98:40.49]Wait, did we do it?
[98:41.39]Yeah, now Jermeth's to put the fire switch.
[98:45.08]We did it!
[98:45.54]No, is it?
[98:47.54]I'm in the way!
[98:50.74]Oh, come on.
[98:52.73]We did it!
[98:54.27]There we go.
[99:12.71]Let's just leave him.
[99:16.04]Is that the mermaid?
[99:19.90]No.
[99:20.52]Oh my god.
[99:21.14]What?
[99:22.42]I'm trying to shoot it.
[99:25.66]I'm going to fucking kill that thing.
[99:28.58]You just crossed me.
[99:30.43]Oh no, not Otto.
[99:33.75]Bring it down.
[99:35.43]Save Otto.
[99:38.93]I'll save my own damn dog.
[99:43.33]I don't need you.
[99:47.65]How's Otto doing?
[99:48.29]What's new with him?
[99:48.99]What's in the news?
[99:51.07]Um, he's gonna be a hot dog for Halloween.
[99:54.99]Oh, that's a big surprise.
[99:56.03]Yeah.
[99:57.65]Whoa!
[99:58.31]What the fuck?
[99:59.19]What?
[100:00.21]This is somebody's arm.
[100:01.13]He's got a nightmare hand.
[100:04.45]Dang.
[100:07.35]Oh.
[100:10.97]Okay, put it down here?
[100:12.58]I need to jump on that to hit the flame.
[100:17.35]Can you freeze the hand?
[100:18.89]I tried it already.
[100:20.93]I think you have to pull him forward, and then I have to get up there.
[100:27.57]He's like, hey, I can't jump in.
[100:31.67]Put down another box so I can jump onto it.
[100:34.13]Well, if I put the box here... No, he breaks the box.
[100:38.69]He's like, hey, fuck that box.
[100:40.77]Oh, there we go.
[100:43.71]Oh, you can do it!
[100:44.69]Use the analog stick, yeah!
[100:46.56]Nice analog aiming.
[100:47.76]Oh no!
[100:50.20]Otto!
[100:58.85]I can just hold him, I think.
[100:59.61]But then I have to... What do we do with the water?
[101:06.13]Get it out of here.
[101:08.31]Waterrrr.
[101:11.35]Oh my god, he's still holding on to Walry.
[101:15.80]Uh, Jerm?
[101:17.75]Okay, that... Hooray!
[101:25.02]You coming?
[101:27.46]Yeah, I was just helping with that bubble.
[101:33.38]You can now conjure a plank.
[101:36.57]New shape!
[101:41.77]Pretty cool.
[101:42.39]So much more advanced than a cube.
[101:47.32]Wow.
[101:48.16]You could- you could not have done that without me.
[101:51.62]Well, but now you're gonna be, like, slightly annoying giant plank guy.
[101:58.25]Okay.
[102:00.05]And I was already pretty annoying.
[102:02.73]New letter.
[102:03.15]My character can't read.
[102:17.37]Um, anything down here?
[102:20.15]Doesn't look like it.
[102:23.60]Steve?
[102:24.68]What do you know?
[102:26.66]He's throwing pool covers at us.
[102:28.38]Great.
[102:29.28]He's declaring war is what he's doing.
[102:31.36]Okay, here.
[102:33.36]No, I gotta stand on this.
[102:35.51]Alright, guys.
[102:37.73]Shit.
[102:41.53]How could a plank help?
[102:43.25]A plank could help.
[102:55.36]Alright, keep it- Where are you- Why are you- What are you doing?
[103:00.48]I don't know.
[103:01.30]Okay, now, I need- Just jump up.
[103:03.04]Jump up and I'll elevator you.
[103:04.28]Go!
[103:06.70]Excellent.
[103:09.62]They're dogs.
[103:10.37]Yeah, I need to- You need to go.
[103:17.41]I'm gonna do this.
[103:19.65]Yep!
[103:21.17]Nice.
[103:22.07]We're synchronized with the wall.
[103:25.43]Anything up there?
[103:25.91]Alright, stop!
[103:27.83]You're hurting Otto.
[103:29.99]You just hit him on the head twice.
[103:31.77]I can't.
[103:31.99]Hold on.
[103:33.23]I need to get off.
[103:34.59]Okay, go ahead.
[103:35.39]Now do the thing you were just doing.
[104:01.76]How come this puzzle isn't solved yet?
[104:03.28]I don't know!
[104:10.33]Uh, I gotta phrase it.
[104:11.71]Phrase, phrase, movie thing.
[104:22.25]That's me, blanking on me.
[104:25.46]I think this is a life lesson.
[104:29.97]You just need a couple of boxes and that's pretty much it.
[104:32.17]Okay.
[104:35.21]Four balls?
[104:35.81]Hold on, I got a new upgrade.
[104:38.95]Oh, you did?
[104:39.41]Well... I'm trying to understand how to use it.
[104:44.36]Wait, what?
[104:46.20]Oh, I can get another upgrade.
[104:49.28]Oh, this is the bouncy ball!
[104:52.51]Is it like a beach ball?
[104:53.41]Can we bounce it around together?
[104:54.59]Oh, that's cool.
[104:57.81]Okay.
[104:58.15]I make ice farts.
[105:01.76]I don't understand how this one works.
[105:03.62]I should be able to push you off.
[105:16.29]This thing doesn't make any sense.
[105:19.07]It says, okay, okay, okay.
[105:22.08]When conjuring an object, keep holding down left or right until the super throw is loaded.
[105:29.82]I can't summon a ball or anything while holding down that button.
[105:33.84]What about his hit?
[105:36.59]Oh.
[105:43.67]Doesn't make any sense.
[105:44.93]Did you just push me off?
[105:53.41]I mean, all we need right now is a couple of boxes.
[105:55.39]Hold on, I'm trying to figure out my thing.
[105:58.17]Here, take your stupid boxes and just solve... I mean, there's not much to solve.
[106:03.12]We just have to jump from jump to jump.
[106:04.70]Well, if I make another one, that one's going to disappear now.
[106:12.05]Oh, it didn't.
[106:15.79]Okay.
[106:15.97]It doesn't work.
[106:17.21]What?!
[106:17.57]What?!
[106:18.39]Oh, the spikes are coming through the plank.
[106:19.79]Spikes are coming through the plank.
[106:21.99]Very slow.
[106:22.69]I have fucking metal shoes on.
[106:24.01]Oh my god.
[106:27.91]No!
[106:28.47]No.
[106:29.12]No.
[106:30.32]Whatever.
[106:30.70]Go forward.
[106:31.90]I'll teleport.
[106:33.36]Doesn't matter.
[106:33.86]Didn't happen.
[106:35.38]We got a fight coming up here.
[106:36.34]You coming?
[106:43.51]I can't figure it out.
[106:45.94]So it's a bouncy... It's a bouncy ball.
[106:52.52]Now, I've had the bouncy ball for a while.
[106:56.54]Yeah, I didn't know how to activate it.
[106:59.16]But now it's when I have something over my head, I'm supposed to be able to shoot it forward.
[107:08.42]But the buttons don't make any sense.
[107:14.39]Another water puzzle coming up here.
[107:21.81]You gotta draw the object you want.
[107:23.53]We'll see if I draw the object.
[107:26.57]I draw a square.
[107:28.57]I'm holding down left click, and the moment I let go, the box is made.
[107:33.21]But in order to throw it forward, it's saying to keep holding down left.
[107:37.30]But I can't keep holding it down because I just fucking made it.
[107:39.82]And I let go of left to make it.
[107:41.96]But if I pick up an object, like I have this object and I hold down left, nothing happens.
[107:45.94]You lost me.
[107:46.62]You lost me at like, are you, hey, are you in the Discord?
[107:49.38]Nothing's happening.
[107:51.05]Honey.
[107:52.98]I have a plank.
[108:00.04]A little bit more to the right.
[108:01.40]A little bit more.
[108:03.46]A little bit.
[108:04.14]A little bit.
[108:05.52]Oh, yep.
[108:06.50]Yep.
[108:07.10]Yeah.
[108:08.36]And then... Honey.
[108:11.02]Another one.
[108:12.02]But this time it goes down there.
[108:13.92]And... There.
[108:17.05]Look at that.
[108:18.65]Look at that.
[108:26.03]Acorn!
[108:28.07]I think we can go up here.
[108:30.67]There's a spike there.
[108:37.93]Okay, now how do we get up there?
[108:39.95]Another one?
[108:40.73]Another block?
[108:44.06]Because look.
[108:52.80]Yep.
[108:54.21]Cool.
[108:54.93]It was a big one.
[108:55.79]It's right-click.
[108:56.49]I've held right-click.
[108:57.89]I'm holding right-click to pick this up right now.
[109:01.00]It says release right-click and it'll shoot.
[109:06.56]I'm holding left-click.
[109:07.52]Like, nothing it says is true.
[109:10.44]And it says when conjuring an object.
[109:15.03]So I can press Q to conjure this?
[109:18.47]Or, hold on.
[109:19.15]I can press... Which one is, uh...
[109:24.07]I forget what button the box is.
[109:25.57]Press F, hold left click.
[109:27.66]Then once I hold left click, I'm fucking moving it.
[109:30.36]Nothing about this.
[109:31.82]Just trying to get over to the other side.
[109:34.60]Okay, there we go.
[109:35.66]I have to hold left click and not on it, and then it primes it in a random spot.
[109:40.30]Okay, we figured it out.
[109:43.38]Steve, they're all accusing you of being bald the longer this rant goes on.
[109:48.71]No!
[109:49.19]I'm good.
[109:55.56]Woo!
[109:59.36]I made it.
[109:59.76]Fuck.
[110:10.41]You guys need help?
[110:11.87]Fuck, no.
[110:12.97]I just did this.
[110:21.74]Fight.
[110:24.43]Incoming.
[110:25.61]Wait a minute, but how do we block that so I can shoot the arrow?
[110:28.28]I understand.
[110:28.66]Like, if I pick up a box, I can't launch it ever because I have to do it when I conjure it.
[110:34.00]Why is this moving like this?
[110:36.16]How?
[110:36.44]I didn't even kill it.
[110:41.23]Ah!
[110:48.53]I mean, it's fun.
[110:49.87]Right now, Star is in his own server, like, shooting bots.
[110:59.25]Hello?
[110:59.65]He just died.
[111:01.51]Hello?
[111:02.01]Hello?
[111:02.47]Can you hear me?
[111:03.65]Yeah.
[111:04.45]Okay.
[111:06.30]My mom was calling me.
[111:07.28]I'm sorry.
[111:09.32]You hung up on her?
[111:11.14]No, she was calling me to come down for dinner.
[111:13.26]That's a lie.
[111:22.42]Okay, now I'm going to shoot that.
[111:24.50]Oh, no, I can't.
[111:25.26]Can someone get rid of this bouncy ball?
[111:27.72]I don't know, maybe we should ask the wizard!
[111:30.56]Get this ball out of here, come on!
[111:55.69]I like the balls a lot, I'm sorry.
[111:57.31]Can we start, can we not have like a rock concert, like with a beach ball flying around?
[112:01.50]Oh, boss, boss.
[112:07.58]Boss Prince.
[112:27.04]Your uncontrolled magic is taking over the forest with nightmares.
[112:31.34]Unless you intend to bury yourself under a mountain, there's no safe place for you in this kingdom.
[112:36.42]Your Highness, there's no other choice.
[112:38.60]You have to come with us.
[112:39.92]You have to kill yourself.
[112:41.02]Oh.
[112:43.21]Let's see what other nightmares the three of you hide in your hearts.
[112:46.51]So he's a bad guy.
[112:47.51]What are you afraid of, Sir Knight?
[112:50.73]Nothing.
[112:51.11]Sir Pontius is a fraud.
[112:54.80]No.
[112:54.86]My mentor.
[112:55.12]So we have to fight the, um... the three of them at the same time.
[112:57.32]My three gay dads.
[112:58.04]How do we do this?
[113:00.00]Wait, these are your three dads?
[113:01.22]Wait.
[113:01.44]Yeah.
[113:16.16]Oh, we're all Pontius?
[113:17.44]I don't even know how to play.
[113:22.36]How do you do dash?
[113:23.12]Oh, you just click shift.
[113:24.96]Shift.
[113:26.26]Then you can plug it out.
[113:27.24]I think you should bounce back his big ball at our dad.
[113:30.64]Oh, now is when the upgrades would matter, I guess.
[113:36.51]They switched me to a different Pontius.
[113:38.67]That's stupid.
[113:39.87]Whoa.
[113:40.29]Now we got to launch.
[113:49.13]Watch the top left.
[113:50.01]Can we pick that up?
[113:52.51]Oh.
[113:55.75]DPS.
[113:56.59]Yeah, I bet you guys wish you had a bouncy ball right now.
[114:00.75]He just broke our shields.
[114:01.77]Oh, shit.
[114:06.95]This is... I kind of do.
[114:08.53]This is kind of messy.
[114:09.49]We gotta get rid of their force fields first.
[114:14.43]Oh.
[114:21.51]Here he comes, he's gonna throw it.
[114:24.03]Oh, that was a bad idea.
[114:25.13]Oh, you have to dash and hit him.
[114:30.67]Honestly, he's the strongest dad.
[114:34.27]Daddy, why?
[114:35.19]Watch the left.
[114:42.84]No, we were too tall.
[114:44.16]No, he was too tall.
[114:44.96]This is...
[114:55.06]Fuck!
[114:55.56]Where'd I go?
[114:56.66]I don't even know where I am.
[114:57.80]Hiya.
[114:58.56]Dead.
[114:59.90]Steve!
[115:01.02]Rez!
[115:01.32]You're alive!
[115:02.00]Rez!
[115:04.46]Ow, I just rezzed into a sword in the head.
[115:06.61]Alright.
[115:08.79]Where's the heals?
[115:09.43]Focus now.
[115:17.23]Wait, I was alive?
[115:24.95]Jeez, we beat the shit out of them.
[115:27.17]Oh my God, look at that hot dad pile.
[115:31.49]Fucking dead.
[115:33.87]You know, we're not saving a prince anymore.
[115:36.28]Selyus is turning into a villain.
[115:38.32]And you know what we do with villains.
[115:40.58]Zoya is right.
[115:41.90]If we can't save the prince, we're going to have to fight him.
[115:45.72]They're going to bring him to court.
[115:47.37]Well, geez, you just slaughtered your whole family.
[115:49.55]Hello?
[115:49.95]You have a problem?
[115:51.35]Hello?
[115:52.53]Dude, heaven.
[115:54.71]Crackling Maya.
[115:56.15]Distressed by their last encounter with Seleus, the heroes continued their dogged pursuit into the wild woodlands.
[116:04.24]As night grew closer, there was no sight nor sound of Seleus, and the heroes found themselves dreadfully lost.
[116:15.84]Is anyone out there?
[116:16.58]Oh, no!
[116:17.08]What?
[116:18.84]What are you doing?
[116:22.98]I'm trying to start the level.
[116:25.95]No!
[116:27.71]And we're- it screwed up all our characters!
[116:32.97]No, I don't want to meet- No, it didn't.
[116:35.63]It didn't?
[116:36.97]Why did it switch you guys?
[116:37.75]What is Jackbox?
[116:38.70]Uh, a little bit.
[116:46.61]Where's Jack?
[116:49.57]Where's Jack?
[116:51.70]Where's Jack?
[117:01.68]Here, speedrun.
[117:02.64]We don't need the extra objectives anymore.
[117:04.62]We don't have all our attribute points.
[117:06.08]It's speedrun time.
[117:07.66]Fine.
[117:09.82]Fine.
[117:10.44]Alright.
[117:10.94]Fine.
[117:13.32]We have observed your plan.
[117:15.54]It's time to observe our place across the quest and whatever she's saying.
[117:21.58]The ground is made out of electricity.
[117:24.30]Step on it!
[117:24.82]Let's go!
[117:25.20]Oh, and that's electrified as well, because it's in the electricity.
[117:32.06]Is that electrified?
[117:32.80]No.
[117:34.09]That's wood.
[117:34.55]Okay.
[117:46.63]That's... That's electrified.
[117:48.31]I'm just so used to jumping on stuff.
[117:50.91]I know!
[117:53.21]No longer electrified.
[117:54.06]Can I freeze it?
[117:55.88]No.
[117:58.08]You just made it... You did a double power.
[118:00.38]You made it twice as more powerful.
[118:02.06]Oh my god, I can kill you guys so easily now.
[118:05.33]You always could.
[118:07.19]I know.
[118:08.47]Power was in me all along.
[118:17.44]Up top.
[118:20.38]Oh, that didn't work.
[118:28.93]We're just going fast now.
[118:31.91]Our drummer said I was good at going fast.
[118:35.53]Yes, you are.
[118:36.99]I didn't say that the two of us were either.
[118:40.00]It's time for me to shine.
[118:42.78]Race, race, race.
[118:45.36]It's electricity.
[118:49.82]Stop jumping in it!
[118:51.20]Well, what do we... Hold up, hold up, hold up.
[118:58.12]Get off of it!
[118:59.10]Oh my god, guys, please get off of it.
[119:00.96]Ashley, please stop.
[119:05.43]You're... Okay.
[119:08.75]Okay.
[119:09.57]Pretty good.
[119:10.13]Nice work.
[119:13.21]You have to shoot the rope.
[119:20.26]Shoot it.
[119:20.52]Shoot the rope.
[119:21.26]Trevor, shoot the rope.
[119:22.16]Something happened.
[119:24.90]You need to build a boat.
[119:27.88]Ow!
[119:29.16]That didn't look electrified.
[119:30.30]I don't think we can get over this.
[119:35.39]Build a what?
[119:37.91]You need to build a bridge.
[119:38.85]I thought you didn't want to collect these anymore.
[119:41.93]Well, you guys were... I was waiting for you to shoot the rope for like an hour.
[119:44.37]Like a full hour.
[119:48.78]How do we open this?
[119:50.80]Oh, the connection needs to be met.
[119:57.17]Right?
[119:58.01]Pull the box out of the way.
[119:59.19]You have to rope it again, I think.
[120:02.33]You can't pull the box up.
[120:03.41]Just lift up the box.
[120:06.27]No, no, no.
[120:07.13]Get it out of the way.
[120:11.06]Tell me what to do again and I'll come to your house and say hello.
[120:15.58]I'll say hi.
[120:24.68]Ugh.
[120:25.88]What?
[120:26.94]I died inside of this thing.
[120:30.51]Oh.
[120:33.03]That thing explodes.
[120:37.93]That's a full party wipe.
[120:39.41]Shit.
[120:41.45]That's bullshit.
[120:42.10]I have plate mail.
[120:50.50]Alright, I'm gonna try to freeze the guy that's electrified, because he's causing all the problems.
[120:58.16]There's the duck!
[121:00.28]Ooh!
[121:01.66]Two ropes at the same time!
[121:06.74]That's so cool.
[121:07.44]Alright, how do I do two ropes at the same time?
[121:10.14]I can use two ropes at the same time.
[121:11.94]Okay.
[121:14.58]Alright, get it out of the way.
[121:16.04]Me and Ashley are going over.
[121:18.19]What are you doing?
[121:22.55]Yeah, that's really cool you got two ropes.
[121:27.21]We're going over.
[121:33.58]Whatever.
[121:44.84]Is it electrified or not?
[121:46.22]It's so hard to tell.
[121:50.09]It is, it is.
[121:50.57]Do I have a wood plank anywhere?
[121:52.07]No, I don't.
[121:54.15]Come on.
[121:54.41]Can you plank us?
[122:03.44]They get electrified.
[122:04.90]Anything I do gets electrified.
[122:06.10]Even the bouncy ball?
[122:09.32]Oh, maybe the bouncy ball doesn't bounce?
[122:11.08]You need a rubber.
[122:14.55]It is rubberized.
[122:15.57]It's only science.
[122:18.59]This is hard though.
[122:25.37]That was almost a full party wipe.
[122:28.41]Without respawn timers.
[122:31.72]Get up.
[122:32.06]Alright, at least somebody got up there.
[122:33.84]That's definitely what you have to do.
[122:39.15]I think we only need one of these, and the second one is causing a problem.
[122:42.39]Well, I made it with two, so you have to make it with two.
[122:44.89]How did I... How did I... I was on the... I was grabbing the edge.
[122:50.06]I made it.
[122:51.70]Wait, we have to be safe.
[122:53.08]Move over.
[122:53.62]I got a link.
[122:59.23]Okay.
[123:00.91]Does that have to stay there?
[123:04.23]What is it doing?
[123:06.25]It's opening a door up there.
[123:11.90]Is it?
[123:14.06]It is.
[123:14.38]Yeah, the top door is opening.
[123:15.94]Can you grab that wood plank?
[123:19.05]There's a wood plank up there on the left.
[123:28.25]He got too close Okay, I got that out of the way
[123:51.78]It's just like, it's clutter everywhere.
[123:53.69]Every time I try and move something, someone touches it.
[123:55.81]Wait, wait, wait.
[123:56.51]I want to die too.
[123:57.57]I could have made it.
[124:00.13]Oh, I'm still up here.
[124:03.39]Alright, you made it.
[124:04.11]Wait, you made it up there.
[124:05.39]Wait, freeze it.
[124:07.09]I can't freeze it.
[124:08.37]Please stop touching my wood.
[124:11.18]I'm touching your wood.
[124:12.80]Yes!
[124:13.42]Alright, now walk forward.
[124:21.36]Okay.
[124:27.34]Oops.
[124:28.78]Okay.
[124:31.14]Now watch that connection.
[124:35.13]Why did I not grab the edge?
[124:36.09]Why did I not grab the edge?
[124:36.91]Why did I?
[124:37.49]Pull it up.
[124:37.83]Help me.
[124:39.25]Just pull the hook.
[124:40.09]Just launch me.
[124:42.45]What?
[124:42.73]What?
[124:43.93]The door's not open.
[124:46.03]It is.
[124:47.07]No, it's not.
[124:51.44]Oh, this box was very slightly not there.
[124:53.55]Well, have fun, you two.
[124:56.01]Get to a place where I can die.
[124:57.23]Quietly.
[125:02.93]Okay, you okay now?
[125:03.82]You come across.
[125:04.48]Okay.
[125:05.96]One at a time.
[125:06.54]Speedrun.
[125:07.82]Very fast.
[125:12.16]We're so good.
[125:14.89]Maybe even the best.
[125:22.75]Ooh, that was slick.
[125:41.07]okay stay positive what's that for what's this for what's this for secret uh wait because I was told no secrets okay no secret look at you trying to get secrets right now that wasn't a secret that was just trying to get the thing oh trying to get the thing oh my god dude
[126:06.01]Remember, if another streamer does a terrible joke, it's not my fault.
[126:10.77]Doesn't matter.
[126:12.19]You endorse everything we say.
[126:14.37]Just by us being here.
[126:15.23]That's how it works.
[126:15.97]They just don't like when you do it.
[126:18.02]Oh, now they don't.
[126:19.62]They don't.
[126:21.94]They don't.
[126:23.40]What now?
[126:25.10]Now I'm going to freeze this one.
[126:29.34]Ball.
[126:29.96]And then give me that ball.
[126:32.61]Let me sneak this way.
[126:35.59]Okay.
[126:35.91]He froze it.
[126:36.43]You're good.
[126:37.47]He's frozen.
[126:39.07]I'm gone.
[126:52.17]I'm... Uh oh.
[126:52.73]They're trying to kill us.
[126:54.79]Wait!
[127:06.61]Wait.
[127:07.43]Why would we wait?
[127:08.21]The whole screen is death right now.
[127:12.75]Okay, don't break that barrel.
[127:16.20]I'm paying you to never make that joke again.
[127:18.00]I got a few more.
[127:21.14]Catch them to work.
[127:24.44]I think you can just... I can just do this.
[127:28.01]No, this.
[127:28.93]No, this.
[127:30.11]No, I want to grab the... No.
[127:40.40]Maybe we need more weight up here?
[127:42.60]Or get that box off of him.
[127:43.36]Oh, that's a thing.
[127:44.82]Yeah, get that box off there.
[127:50.33]Oh god.
[127:52.51]That kind of does it.
[127:53.41]Alright, I'm over here.
[128:05.42]Whoo!
[128:09.65]Oh, you can ice block it.
[128:10.86]The ice doesn't seem to be frozen.
[128:12.42]Can't make that jump, though.
[128:13.32]We need a box.
[128:14.50]The ice doesn't seem to be frozen.
[128:16.92]The box is frozen.
[128:18.90]The box is... Wait, but if you do that... That works.
[128:27.39]Now we just have to figure out how to go from here to there.
[128:32.27]Probably with a...
[128:35.70]A box, maybe?
[128:37.08]A ball?
[128:38.67]And then another bouncy ball.
[128:39.95]Ooh, but wait a minute.
[128:40.77]Nope.
[128:42.75]Yeah, I think we can do this.
[128:46.19]But hold on.
[128:48.53]Why did I just electro- What?
[128:52.43]Why did that happen?
[128:57.04]Oh, you know what we gotta do.
[128:58.54]You know what it's time for.
[128:59.64]What?
[129:02.14]Yeah, that's what I just said.
[129:06.56]Start it over.
[129:07.28]Let's do it.
[129:07.66]Wait, wait!
[129:09.32]Ooh!
[129:10.94]Give me another one.
[129:12.46]Come on, give me that.
[129:17.52]What I was trying to do is I was trying to make it... It doesn't bounce that high.
[129:21.65]Shit.
[129:22.85]This is the worst thing in the world.
[129:24.03]When I jump for something, it's moving away.
[129:25.27]I thought it was gonna bounce higher.
[129:33.24]Certainly not what they want you to do.
[129:36.06]Shit.
[129:37.71]Come on.
[129:38.19]This will work.
[129:39.85]Just believe.
[129:41.01]I definitely have to make a... Put a box over here.
[129:43.80]Not on the ice.
[129:44.84]Put a box on the ice.
[129:45.98]Right?
[129:46.84]Man, I can just do this.
[129:48.22]Somebody just... Why did you die?
[129:49.92]I don't know.
[129:51.62]Something funky going on.
[129:59.50]Game?
[130:00.93]So now that's safe.
[130:02.13]But now... Just launch one of us up there.
[130:06.37]okay uh alright we got it and just solve it with box physics alright then do we need that ball for anything I guess not probably this guy's gotta go
[130:41.16]Skellington?
[130:41.66]Oh, those things can destroy my ropes.
[130:44.18]Just block those holes.
[130:45.02]No.
[130:45.08]I just saved my head.
[130:46.36]Okay.
[130:46.54]Just do rope, rope, rope.
[130:47.78]Get this box out of the way because it targets the box.
[130:50.32]Okay.
[131:11.41]I can't destroy the box, and the boxes wasn't okay.
[131:15.01]There's that one.
[131:17.81]I could do another one from here to there.
[131:20.63]Like, from here to there.
[131:21.93]I don't know if that helps as well.
[131:27.87]There you go.
[131:28.77]There's two bouncy balls.
[131:30.19]I can go from here to there.
[131:31.23]Alright, no, no, no, okay.
[131:33.18]I can go across.
[131:35.00]Just block each of the, oh, both the holes.
[131:42.94]Oh, ew.
[131:43.84]Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[131:48.34]It really... Oh, my God.
[131:52.26]Okay, I made it.
[131:53.56]I made it.
[131:54.62]Good.
[131:56.20]Now... Yeah, yeah, I think this is the result we were looking for.
[131:59.27]But I just can't die.
[132:00.29]Yeah.
[132:06.87]Just keep going.
[132:07.45]Just keep going.
[132:08.34]I died.
[132:08.60]Don't die.
[132:09.56]It's impossible.
[132:10.76]It's impossible to do by myself.
[132:12.10]I'm just... Okay, wait.
[132:14.80]If I do this... I can make that.
[132:17.02]Can you guys get over here?
[132:17.98]I can't make that.
[132:22.99]Fuck!
[132:24.23]How did that work?
[132:25.21]Alright, we're good.
[132:26.55]Okay, I'm gonna shit my pants.
[132:29.67]I already did.
[132:30.61]Sorry to hear that.
[132:33.07]Same.
[132:34.81]I need to shoot the one below.
[132:39.16]Did I get it?
[132:43.52]Where am I?
[132:46.20]Where the fuck am I?
[132:48.74]I'm apparently still alive.
[132:54.65]What?
[132:56.57]How did I end up back here?
[133:01.85]Things are getting goofy, guys.
[133:04.34]They are.
[133:12.27]There has to be a button to unsummon.
[133:15.66]I can't... They're stuck.
[133:19.10]I need to cut this.
[133:23.04]Let me get this thing out of here.
[133:24.34]Yeah, get that ball out of here.
[133:25.68]I can't, it's attached still.
[133:28.18]What?
[133:31.63]Yeah, it has a rope on it in the back.
[133:35.01]Shouldn't have any ropes.
[133:36.85]I think it's wanting you to go under the bottom...
[133:42.61]attached to the thing on the top.
[133:44.51]It's electrified.
[133:46.11]Yeah, like hang a rope from these and swing to the other side.
[133:49.97]You understand?
[133:58.95]Hold on, let me... I gotta have it be small.
[134:08.89]Okay.
[134:10.51]I can now ride it all the way across.
[134:12.57]Now you have a lever.
[134:16.21]Pull it!
[134:21.19]Nice.
[134:22.75]Wooooo!
[134:28.33]Oh wait, don't destroy this.
[134:30.56]Okay.
[134:31.42]I guess they just explode when they touch lightning.
[134:35.58]Okay, um... I think they just explode in general.
[134:42.43]It's a little electrified.
[134:43.67]You can rub it.
[134:44.43]There's a rope.
[134:46.07]Oh, right, because it's sticky.
[134:48.92]It's very sticky.
[134:54.26]Oh, jeez.
[134:56.26]Now we're getting high level.
[134:57.88]Okay, that's not electrified.
[134:59.12]Uh, I gotta... Which one should I freeze?
[135:04.53]Left one?
[135:07.01]Sure.
[135:08.17]Uh... If you can.
[135:10.31]I think you can just get over here.
[135:12.01]There's a safe spot.
[135:15.51]Oh, there is a safe spot right over there, isn't there?
[135:19.13]You're hurt.
[135:20.73]Okay.
[135:21.71]I can just launch someone?
[135:23.97]Oh god, wait, wait, wait.
[135:24.71]Hold on.
[135:26.23]Yep.
[135:30.12]Alright, ready?
[135:34.52]I can just- hold on.
[135:37.88]See?
[135:39.63]Now you don't have to worry.
[135:41.71]Now you're safe.
[135:51.09]Okay.
[135:57.41]Enjoy your Kinect.
[135:59.78]You're gonna play Kinect.
[136:00.34]C-O-N-N-E-C-T.
[136:14.34]It's working for a second.
[136:15.18]Can you freeze?
[136:15.94]Yeah.
[136:17.04]We gotta wait for this to come around and it's gonna work.
[136:26.89]Oh my god.
[136:28.15]What?
[136:30.79]Where are we?
[136:32.83]Can you freeze the top thing?
[136:35.79]No.
[136:37.82]I said no as I pressed it and did it.
[136:40.74]Oh, that's good.
[136:41.24]That's okay.
[136:43.70]No, it breaks the height.
[136:45.18]Okay, freeze it again.
[136:46.04]I can't get that out of it.
[136:54.24]Do it.
[137:02.87]What?
[137:03.11]Now it's not breaking.
[137:06.51]Well, you gotta... How do you... You have to electrify the top one.
[137:10.49]So, like that, yeah.
[137:11.47]Yeah, it broke last time, though.
[137:12.69]I don't know why.
[137:13.31]What?
[137:18.19]Maybe because we didn't compliment you enough.
[137:20.33]Yeah, that might have been it.
[137:21.69]Whoops.
[137:26.71]That was fun.
[137:29.85]Jerma shot it, did he?
[137:31.26]Did he ruin the whole thing?
[137:32.62]I don't think he did.
[137:35.58]Oh, she's pregnant.
[137:37.78]A fishy creature of the marshlands had surprised the heroes with her assistance.
[138:07.51]They had been given a vial containing a little bit of magic, but they didn't yet know what to do with it.
[138:14.47]Following the mermaid's advice.
[138:16.73]It is currently three o'clock Pacific.
[138:20.63]Do you want to Jack?
[138:21.82]It might be Jack time.
[138:24.84]Want to Jack off?
[138:25.70]No.
[138:26.04]No, no.
[138:29.68]What?
[138:30.80]Zero has it pre-scheduled every day.
[138:33.68]Ah!
[138:34.97]Now that he's changed stream schedules, it's messing him up a bit.
[138:37.77]His house is full of alarm clocks and they all go off.
[138:39.95]3-4!
[138:40.25]3-30!
[138:40.67]3-10!
[138:40.93]Time to Jack!
[138:47.65]Alright, the next time anybody dies, we move on.
[138:52.17]The next time anybody dies, we move on to Jackbox, okay?
[138:55.19]He's about to just jump off the map.
[138:56.57]Nope, try as hard as you can.
[138:58.68]Okay.
[138:59.66]Okay.
[139:00.12]Okay.
[139:00.32]Trying.
[139:00.50]I'm trying so hard.
[139:15.37]There we go.
[139:16.53]Wait, freeze it.
[139:17.17]I'm trying hard.
[139:25.17]Fight!
[139:25.95]Fight!
[139:26.59]Fight!
[139:28.65]I don't want to see any deaths here.
[139:33.19]I'm almost in.
[139:35.44]I got you.
[139:43.38]Nice.
[139:52.63]Why is that frozen?
[139:56.07]Ooh, has the fairy rope.
[139:57.43]When attaching a rope to a loose object, keep holding down.
[140:03.43]Well, hold on.
[140:03.77]Let me get rid of this.
[140:05.71]Keep holding down.
[140:07.81]So what does that mean?
[140:10.39]Tie the rope to the hook.
[140:11.69]I can just walk it?
[140:12.87]That's weird.
[140:14.39]Can you get your ball out of the way?
[140:15.67]I can't because people keep walking on it and it's getting stuck on things.
[140:18.69]Also, I don't know.
[140:19.61]It's just not letting me pick it up.
[140:25.32]Yeah, I don't understand.
[140:26.00]What did that room do?
[140:27.98]I don't know.
[140:28.95]Hold on.
[140:29.31]I think I can just... Oh, it just pulls it up?
[140:33.21]So no matter what, it's gonna pull... I guess?
[140:35.51]Okay.
[140:36.19]It looks like he just intentionally walked to his death because he wants the jackets.
[140:40.47]Oh, jackbox!
[140:41.30]Fuck.
[140:41.74]Yeah, that's right.
[140:42.58]That's right.
[140:43.20]Hello.
[140:44.58]Yeah, it's time.
[140:46.26]It's time.
[140:47.86]Alright.
[140:50.30]Who knew that Jerma would die first?
[140:53.06]I actually really was not.
[140:54.04]I was just trying to work it out.
[141:00.66]Alright, Jackbox Party Pack 6.
[141:04.37]You guys don't need it.
[141:05.53]I don't think anybody needs it but me, right?
[141:10.43]That's how it was traditionally.
[141:11.83]Yeah, I think we just need the website and the code.
[141:16.57]So don't give out the code on stream so we can join.
[141:18.49]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[141:20.68]I mean, you're pretty amateur, so.
[141:22.54]No, I have sub-Discord.
[141:23.88]I don't put it in the stream.
[141:24.80]What are you talking about?
[141:26.36]Well, no, give it to us.
[141:27.18]Yeah, I'm going to give it to you, but I'm going to give it to sub-Discord after you get it.
[141:29.94]I'm not your sub-Discord.
[141:32.76]Yeah, I've been subbed to you for like seven years.
[141:35.82]I've never taken it off.
[141:39.84]Alright, let me switch.
[141:40.96]Just give me one second.
[141:43.05]Alright, give me a sec.
[141:44.89]Alright, everybody take like a break.
[141:46.63]How about like a two-minute, three-minute break?
[141:48.53]Go pee, get some water, and when you come back, Jackbox will be going strong.
[141:55.04]Okay, sounds good.
[141:56.24]Be right back.
