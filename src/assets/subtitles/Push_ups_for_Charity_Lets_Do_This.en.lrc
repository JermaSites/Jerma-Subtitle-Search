[00:08.13]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.78]Jerma here with kind of a different video.
[00:12.14]This is not going to be a vlog, even though it's starting out as one.
[00:15.68]This is going to be a charity video.
[00:17.90]Now, I've never done something like this before, but it's always something I wanted to do.
[00:22.13]And this specifically is something I've kind of had my eyes on for the last couple of months, but I wanted to get...
[00:28.07]Stronger before I did it.
[00:29.95]So what exactly am I talking about?
[00:31.51]What am I going to do?
[00:32.89]So I'm gonna do push-ups as many push-ups in a row as I can possibly do and for every one push-up I do it's gonna be five dollars donated to charity that charity is going to be the Jimmy fund located in Boston So I'm pretty excited about this.
[00:47.78]I don't know how much money I'm gonna be actually donating I'm gonna calculate it after those push-ups are done but
[00:52.82]We will see how that goes.
[00:53.94]I'm going to do it right now at Burgah Boy's house in T-minus 35 minutes or something like that, 30 seconds.
[01:00.61]However long it takes me to drive over there and do it.
[01:03.19]So I hope you guys enjoy, and we'll do the calculation after I get done doing the push-up.
[01:07.07]So, see you in a few minutes.
[01:08.66]Oh, the carolers in the background.
[01:10.16]How beautiful.
[01:13.08]Alright, let's do this thing.
[01:14.88]So remember, $5 for every one push-up.
[01:18.22]Let's see how many I can do.
[01:19.20]You ready for this, folks?
[01:21.38]Alright, Burgah Boy cameraman, here we go.
[01:26.26]Regulation.
[01:30.01]Oh, God!
[01:32.01]I don't even know why I lost count because of your freaking dog.
[01:36.81]It's stalling over again.
[01:38.05]No, no, no, just keep going.
[01:39.80]Are you still filming?
[01:40.56]Yeah.
[01:41.08]Okay, good.
[02:28.60]I got another one in me.
[02:30.32]Let's go, Brady.
[02:31.29]Two more.
[02:34.69]One more.
[02:35.21]This is for charity.
[02:39.05]I'm not done.
[02:41.31]Five more.
[02:42.41]Five.
[02:48.75]Well done.
[02:50.17]Keep it rolling.
[02:51.01]I am.
[02:51.29]I don't know how many that was.
[02:54.19]I blame the two dogs for interrupting that.
[02:58.41]We'll do the calculation.
[02:59.49]We'll see how much money I'm donating.
[03:00.65]See you in a second.
[03:03.03]So as you can see, I did 47 push-ups, which totals to $235 going to the Jimmy Fund.
[03:09.86]The Jimmy Fund is a cancer research program located here in Boston.
[03:14.20]But the purpose of this video is to kind of do a call to action, I guess you could say.
[03:18.98]And if you liked what you saw...
[03:21.66]go ahead and shoot me a video response of you doing the same thing.
[03:24.32]Now, you don't have to do the same denomination as I did, $5 for one.
[03:29.39]Maybe you're only going to do $1 or $2 for one, but I'd love to see it.
[03:32.89]Please put it as a video response to this video.
[03:36.15]Let's raise as much money as we possibly can and getting physically fit while we're at it, baby.
[03:40.88]I'll leave you with Burgah Boy's attempt to do this same charity drive.
[03:44.80]So I'll see you guys all next time at a course.
[03:47.65]Take care, everybody.
[03:48.71]Happy holidays.
[03:49.69]You said hold the position.
[03:54.05]You gotta go.
[03:54.83]She won't let you.
[03:55.87]Oh, what a freak.
[03:56.98]One.
[03:57.48]That's one.
[03:58.00]That's only one.
[04:01.58]How do you beat that?
[04:03.68]Alright, we got $5 from Burgah Boy.
