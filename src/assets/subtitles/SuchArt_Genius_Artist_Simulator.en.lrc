[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.26]Why are you upset with me?
[00:05.48]We're upset with you.
[00:06.12]Why?
[00:06.32]Why?
[00:11.28]It's like 15 minutes.
[00:14.26]Why are you upset?
[00:15.83]Oh, right.
[00:16.31]You guys changed.
[00:17.01]I see what you're doing.
[00:24.87]Oh, right.
[00:25.51]Because a day or two ago.
[00:26.95]Now I remember.
[00:29.31]Finally.
[00:30.12]I'm here.
[00:30.50]I just want to be ready.
[00:38.81]He remembered.
[00:39.43]I did remember.
[00:46.59]I'm here.
[00:48.13]And here's what we're going to do.
[00:51.38]I didn't even... Look, I'm glad that there's people that remind me of certain things.
[00:55.50]Certain releases and games that I played a year or so ago that come out later.
[01:00.48]Because I play something, even if it's a demo or whatever, right?
[01:05.16]And then I just forget it exists.
[01:07.88]So one such game was such art.
[01:14.31]I played the demo or the free version of it.
[01:17.81]It was a lot of fun.
[01:19.11]I've made some paintings.
[01:21.23]And I've been told that it's now out.
[01:24.71]How long has it been out for?
[01:36.64]Four years.
[01:49.34]I'm excited.
[01:55.48]Rerun Andy.
[01:57.00]Yeah, the queen died, yeah.
[02:07.53]Crazy.
[02:07.83]I mean, I don't have really anything to say about it.
[02:09.87]Other than, yeah, that's, uh... That's crazy.
[02:14.53]Almost 100.
[02:19.13]Hope I fucking live to 100.
[02:23.99]Is your mic better?
[02:29.40]That's crazy, Omegalull.
[02:34.94]Dude, y'all are like... Well, I don't... Look.
[02:44.95]Oh, that's crazy.
[02:53.42]You're going to be on Twitch for 50 years?
[02:57.28]No, I'm not.
[02:58.14]I'm telling you right now.
[03:05.63]Yeah, what a take on that.
[03:08.33]Oh man, that's crazy.
[03:11.11]That's crazy.
[03:11.73]Anyways, so we got some stuff going on today.
[03:16.73]Yeah, that was not a good take.
[03:22.84]I don't even know what to say about stuff like this though, right?
[03:26.36]I'm so bad with giving takes on anything.
[03:30.16]That's why I never give them.
[03:43.32]He gives cold takes.
[03:51.81]Here's what I will say.
[03:55.49]So the queen... Is it gonna... I mean, I'm gonna sound probably dumb here.
[04:05.57]Is that the last queen?
[04:13.43]No.
[04:15.31]Is this just gonna keep going?
[04:21.79]I guess we have the prince and the princess, right?
[04:24.35]But is it going to be the queen of England?
[04:34.88]NA education.
[04:35.80]There already is.
[04:38.54]Monarchy sequel.
[04:42.36]King for now.
[04:45.71]I don't know.
[04:46.09]I generally don't really know how it works.
[04:47.95]I just didn't know.
[04:50.97]But yeah, as a popular streamer on the internet has once said, that's crazy.
[05:02.75]I mean, I'm quoting somebody else.
[05:07.04]But no, I mean, like I said, I would hope I get to live to be 100.
[05:09.64]But we're going to play such art.
[05:19.26]That's crazy.
[05:27.85]I would love to be 100.
[05:29.14]Yeah.
[05:29.26]When are you going to play Disney Infinity 3.0?
[05:35.53]You know, one of the things I was going to do...
[05:38.53]was gonna play that new Disney game that came out today what's it called like Disney magical village or something whatever it's called just to have everybody say wait I thought you would rather show your than play the Disney infinity but you're gonna play the Disney kind of animal crossing game
[06:12.87]Show people the question marking.
[06:14.67]It's like two days ago.
[06:26.21]You would get it if you were there.
[06:29.49]Look what you did.
[06:30.09]Look what you started.
[06:43.02]Is it Bathroom Mike?
[06:43.90]It's not a... This is... Alright.
[06:46.68]That made me angry.
[06:55.53]Yeah, let's start playing.
[06:56.31]You should play Splatoon 3.
[07:14.45]I didn't even know there was a Splatoon 2.
[07:18.84]I can't play Splatoon.
[07:20.12]I can't do it.
[07:20.84]I've already talked about I can't play Splatoon.
[07:32.04]It's a skill issue.
[07:32.78]Yes, it is.
[07:33.96]I've been very vocal about how it's a skill issue.
[07:36.80]You are correct.
[07:46.38]What about art?
[07:47.02]I'm doing art right now.
[07:48.02]Well, in two seconds.
[07:51.40]He's really bad at it.
[07:52.31]You've never seen me play Splatoon.
[07:53.61]You don't know that.
[07:59.85]Yeah, the only thing I will say about the queen is... And we'll move on.
[08:03.68]I hope to live a long, fulfilling life.
[08:08.50]96.
[08:08.66]That's very old.
[08:11.24]So that's, um... I mean, I know some people that live up into their 90s, 80s.
[08:17.40]That's a long life.
[08:26.67]That's crazy.
[08:27.33]God damn it.
[08:29.77]This is why I don't talk about anything on stream.
[08:33.21]Because I'm so bad at articulating a single fucking actual point about anything.
[08:37.85]that it always just kind of comes out as yeah that's uh oh that's crazy man I can't I can't do it I'm so bad at articulating like serious points god damn it now that's the alright let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go alright we're done we're going we're moving forward
[09:07.67]I can't... I can never... This is why I can't talk about anything.
[09:13.19]Because I was thinking about it before the stream.
[09:14.59]I'm like, oh yeah, that's right.
[09:16.55]The queen did die.
[09:17.70]Okay.
[09:18.72]Let me think of something maybe meaningful to say.
[09:23.04]What could I say?
[09:23.92]Okay.
[09:26.40]That's wild.
[09:28.83]Steam coming out of my fucking shirt.
[09:36.31]Nice public statement, Andy.
[09:47.20]You're a Looney Tunes character?
[09:48.76]No, dude.
[09:49.44]I just... I'm just not good with serious topics.
[09:54.80]I never have been.
[09:55.98]Ever.
[09:59.73]So let's go.
[10:10.85]What's up?
[10:12.43]How you doing?
[10:16.13]Dude, you're like the Joker.
[10:17.39]I'm not.
[10:17.77]No, stop.
[10:18.53]I'm not at all.
[10:19.47]Please.
[10:22.93]Anybody that says they're the Joker is actually the Penguin.
[10:25.73]Anybody that says they're the Penguin is actually the Riddler.
[10:28.03]And if you say you're the Riddler, you're actually the Joker.
[10:30.21]We already went over this.
[10:31.01]We did this already.
[10:34.05]I don't want to... Where are you?
[10:35.06]There you are.
[10:35.76]You're far away today.
[10:37.08]I don't want to be the Penguin.
[10:38.58]I'm not the Penguin.
[10:39.64]Actually, I might be.
[10:44.82]New angle?
[10:45.50]Yeah, you're up there.
[10:50.30]This camera angle makes you look short.
[10:51.85]I'm sitting in a... No, there's no routine.
[10:54.87]There's no bit coming.
[10:55.79]People think there's a routine coming.
[10:58.35]No, no, there's no routine.
[10:59.75]There's not going to be a joke.
[11:00.59]There's no bit on the way.
[11:01.99]I'm just sitting in the chair and I move the camera.
[11:04.45]Because I got sick of moving... So the camera used to sit here on the monitor.
[11:12.02]And the problem, he's in a high chair.
[11:17.92]I think it's a good angle.
[11:19.98]This looks super set up for something.
[11:22.00]It's not.
[11:24.06]I swear to God, it's just a new angle.
[11:25.90]I just put you in it.
[11:27.20]No one's going to come out of the closet over there and like strangle me with a bag or something.
[11:31.18]I promise.
[11:32.54]It's just a new angle.
[11:33.82]Because when I move my mouse, my keyboard's on the desk and it shakes the desk a little, which shakes the camera that's on the monitor that's being shaken from me touching the desk.
[11:46.02]And I don't like it.
[11:47.34]So now I can go like this and I don't shake you.
[11:52.74]Nice isometric Andy.
[11:53.96]It's a bad angle.
[11:58.70]Fix it.
[11:59.26]It's staying like this for at least the whole day today.
[12:04.21]It's zoomed in all weird.
[12:05.41]The background is massive behind you.
[12:08.69]What are you talking about?
[12:10.29]What is going on here?
[12:11.31]It's a different camera angle.
[12:16.85]It's just a different angle.
[12:20.85]That's a closet right there.
[12:27.43]See, look, this is a closet.
[12:28.83]That's the closet.
[12:31.05]I'm just sitting down.
[12:32.25]We don't like change.
[12:33.21]Yeah, I can see that.
[12:38.97]It's all zoomed in and weird.
[12:40.47]It's not.
[12:46.47]It's a CCTV angle.
[12:48.83]We'll get used to it for the next six hours because that's what we're doing today.
[12:55.53]You look so small.
[13:00.23]The FOV looks odd.
[13:02.65]There's no FOV.
[13:03.47]What are you guys talking about?
[13:08.97]Anyways, today, ladies and gentlemen, we've got some... Hey, there you are.
[13:12.33]Ladies and gentlemen, today we've got some fun stuff.
[13:15.27]I'm going to be playing such art as you see on the screen right now.
[13:18.83]We're going to be playing multiverses later.
[13:24.13]Security camera.
[13:31.80]What the fuck?
[13:33.18]Why is it going so high?
[13:41.79]Huh?
[13:43.41]Is this what it looks like?
[13:44.19]That's what it... Alright, well, whatever.
[13:56.76]Why can't you see the ceiling?
[14:03.89]Why can that go... Why is that going so high?
[14:05.87]I cropped it.
[14:13.28]I cropped it, yeah.
[14:14.34]I didn't know it was that much space above me.
[14:16.18]Oh, well, you're getting the CCTV angle today.
[14:23.06]This is a bit... No, I swear to God, it's not.
[14:31.85]Keep the full view.
[14:33.51]You want me to do this?
[14:45.13]Okay, guys, welcome to the stream.
[14:46.73]We're here.
[14:47.09]You can see my ceiling.
[14:51.88]Okay, so I got streamer mode turned on, by the way.
[14:54.08]Somebody said Alice in Wonderland.
[15:08.94]I don't know what streamer mode does, but I'm surely going to turn it off in probably five minutes.
[15:15.97]Alright, so we're going to play this.
[15:16.85]We're going to play multiverses later, by the way, in case you didn't know.
[15:19.69]Hey, hold on.
[15:22.03]I got that juggle.
[15:23.23]Hold on.
[15:25.39]Can you see this?
[15:28.91]Oh, can you see that?
[15:29.99]Can I do like tricks like that?
[15:41.82]Alright, anyways, we're going to play Multiversus later.
[15:45.36]Gizmo just came out, which is awesome.
[15:47.72]I'm very excited.
[15:48.42]It's going to be a sponsored stream.
[15:50.14]Sponsored segment of the stream.
[15:51.44]This part's not sponsored.
[15:53.38]But, I mean, I'm going to play it.
[15:55.84]And Gizmo, Gremlins 2 is one of my favorite movies ever made.
[15:59.45]We literally just talked about it on Hey Donna.
[16:01.91]Which, if you haven't seen Hey Donna, it's a great show.
[16:04.45]Go check it out.
[16:06.01]Will Neff.
[16:08.54]Stretch the game to fit.
[16:09.98]It looks weird.
[16:10.68]No, this is funny for five seconds.
[16:12.32]I'm going back to what it was.
[16:16.56]But yeah, Gizmo from Gremlins is in multiverses as of right now.
[16:21.50]And I would be lying if I told you I wasn't very excited.
[16:26.01]And I was going to play it, so that's really cool.
[16:28.21]Warner Brothers is going to obviously sponsor that segment of the stream, which is just cool.
[16:31.75]I'm happy to do that.
[16:36.61]I very much enjoy the game, so...
[16:40.78]Alright, we're going to show this only once, and that's it, and we're going to move on finally.
[16:43.64]It's been like 15 minutes.
[17:13.92]Can you guys hear?
[17:21.00]My name's Jeremy.
[17:21.84]Story mode.
[17:22.32]What's fast forward?
[17:26.77]Try just to fast forward.
[17:27.65]Speeds are the pace at which you will gain fame and money.
[17:32.71]If you want to, say, only play a couple hours for the purpose of a stream or a video, this might be for you.
[17:38.56]What?
[17:38.78]Are you serious?
[17:42.22]They made a streamer version of the game.
[17:48.29]That's actually kind of perfect.
[17:50.65]Let's try it.
[17:51.25]Let's do the streamer version.
[17:52.39]Oh, cutscene.
[18:06.80]Okay.
[18:08.20]I've got artistic talent.
[18:10.40]Just play my MS Paint.
[18:12.10]This is not even close to being the same thing.
[18:15.96]For decades, art has been largely dominated by robots and other artificial... I can't... If a word has more than four syllables, I can't say it anymore.
[18:22.68]What happened?
[18:23.90]Artificial.
[18:24.66]That's four syllables.
[18:25.98]What actually happened to me?
[18:27.94]It's been the last three streams.
[18:29.22]What happened?
[18:29.80]I'm fucking serious.
[18:32.48]Artificial intelligence.
[18:33.34]By the way, this is already happening.
[18:37.85]Yeah, I've seen the Kermit the Frog in Scarface.
[18:41.09]Realistic 2015, right?
[18:45.09]It's crazy.
[18:45.87]It's actually crazy.
[18:48.72]Wow, that's crazy.
[18:49.78]Again, here we are.
[18:50.32]Great.
[18:51.44]I'm really good at talking about anything.
[18:59.52]Okay, the world of art has become stale and in need of renewal.
[19:04.79]It is time for you to act.
[19:07.69]You've been assigned a studio on board the International Space City so you can fully express your artistic self.
[19:14.65]As on Earth, the threat of a robotic revolt is rising.
[19:17.28]An alien species, the Krabux, covered the planet's saltwater.
[19:21.70]Only you can decide what to paint on your next canvas.
[19:25.36]Alright, so I remember this game.
[19:26.80]I did, I think it was pretty fun last time.
[19:28.75]I have a streamer menu.
[19:29.93]I don't know what the streamer menu is, but we are going to do this.
[19:37.63]I'm going to turn this down.
[19:40.57]Streamer menu.
[19:41.45]Is that working?
[19:50.72]Does that work?
[19:55.00]We're at 0.5%.
[19:55.98]I feel like that's not changing to that level.
[20:00.80]Okay, that's fine.
[20:02.05]Alright, so what you can't see it?
[20:03.83]Streamer menu.
[20:06.44]I don't want to spoil anything because I know if I pull this up... That's my camera, you idiot.
[20:10.98]If I pull this up and there's a command you can write, I want to make sure it's not something you can spam right away.
[20:15.50]Hold on.
[20:21.35]Challenge my skills.
[20:22.37]Challenge my style.
[20:24.69]Boo me.
[20:25.75]Rate my painting.
[20:26.73]Okay, this is fine.
[20:29.29]How does this work?
[20:33.77]Well, let me get in the video game first.
[20:35.69]Wait, I can ask you to boo me?
[20:38.95]Alright, well, let's go.
[20:50.27]How do you do this?
[20:52.53]Ongoing poll.
[20:53.23]Boo or applaud Jerma985's performance.
[20:58.17]How does this work?
[21:03.74]Did you guys see anything in chat?
[21:14.60]No?
[21:14.82]14 viewers?
[21:31.41]How many people are real here?
[21:35.66]Only 14 of you figured that out.
[21:38.68]Hold on a minute.
[21:40.18]Wait.
[21:41.32]There are 12,000 of you here.
[21:44.57]There are 12,000.
[21:46.71]And only 14 of you figured it out.
[21:51.43]No way.

[22:58.68]Following the results of your last DNA test in light of your artistic potential, you've been registered with the Talent Development Program, a United Earth program.
[23:07.02]Alright.
[23:12.87]There are boxes everywhere.
[23:15.05]Is that normal?
[23:18.13]I have to sit up too.
[23:18.93]You have to type boo or clap with the exclamation point.
[23:23.11]Oh, okay.
[23:24.80]Okay, cool.
[23:26.28]Some equipment could not be installed before your arrival.
[23:28.38]Some of them essential to your work will soon be assembled by our technicians.
[23:33.02]You have to pay the installation costs.
[23:34.37]Alright.
[23:34.95]Fine.

[24:08.76]F. What?
[24:15.64]What do you mean F?
[24:20.13]There's no F. You lied to me.
[24:26.93]Yeah, content creator, comma, artist, comma, producer, comma, director, comma, world-renowned physician, comma.
[24:34.90]I just add a lot of shit.
[24:35.86]I just do a lot of things.
[24:38.16]Okay.
[24:39.10]Dear big brother, I heard you have some hidden artistic genes.
[24:43.64]I didn't know.
[24:44.08]In a new studio in space.
[24:45.06]Why are you saying F?
[24:47.08]Stop saying F.
[24:48.91]Okay.
[24:49.77]Meanwhile, yesterday was my birthday and I didn't get anything from you.
[24:52.41]So I suggest you paint me a great piece of art to make up for it.
[24:55.99]I want a beautiful painting of a unicorn with plenty of colors.
[24:58.97]Okay.
[25:00.79]You got it.
[25:01.55]A unicorn with colors.
[25:03.16]Well, I was about to paint the screen.
[25:05.74]Okay, I'll do it here.
[25:06.70]Okay, so we need to do a unicorn.
[25:14.54]And this would be beautiful.
[25:20.41]Okay, cool.
[25:22.25]You can throw an object with E. Yep, there's no paint on this.
[25:26.46]Pick up an object by holding.
[25:27.44]Yep, let me get used to the controls.
[25:29.76]You can jump.
[25:31.10]Some items have a special action.
[25:32.94]Press F to trigger it.
[25:34.54]Okay, yeah, I can turn it.
[25:35.98]Cool.
[25:38.72]Press left control to crouch and paint the ugly floor.
[25:41.19]Okay, very cool.
[25:44.49]Nice.
[25:45.39]Alright, it's time to paint a unicorn.
[25:53.10]Do I have access to the whole studio?
[25:54.10]Alright, I'm thinking clouds.
[25:56.70]I'm thinking blues.
[25:58.12]I'm thinking like a really nice blue.
[25:59.78]Okay.
[26:07.45]Wait, how big does it need to be?
[26:08.97]Oh, right.
[26:09.61]Alright.
[26:11.31]Here we go.
[26:12.87]I can move this thing up and down, can't I?
[26:14.23]Yeah.
[26:43.75]No, I don't want green.
[26:48.18]Get that out of here.
[26:48.96]Alright, I need more blue.
[26:55.85]I don't need an easel.
[26:56.73]Fuck it.
[27:19.24]Looks pretty good so far.
[27:20.24]I gotta get up top, though.
[27:23.63]Ruined.
[27:25.29]Not really.
[27:25.69]Let me go down, actually.
[27:31.67]This is a 90s design?
[27:33.77]Well, I'm a fucking 90s kid!
[27:35.65]Of course it's gonna be 90s.
[27:46.11]It's bad on purpose?
[27:48.08]This is not even... I haven't even begun.
[27:49.60]I just got the canvas.
[27:54.16]It's not even close.
[27:55.66]It looks pretty good.
[27:56.34]It does actually look kind of good.
[27:58.05]It's not even close.
[27:59.37]I need more blue.
[28:03.75]Is this empty?
[28:08.97]Yeah.
[28:09.21]How do I throw this away?
[28:11.35]Is there trash?
[28:11.85]This is going to be the trash for now.
[28:17.82]Alright, I want this.
[28:18.64]I want this.
[28:20.68]And this.
[28:22.30]Alright, let's get that combined over here.
[28:38.89]You throw trash into space.
[28:40.55]Hold on.
[28:48.61]I gotta flip it.
[28:52.41]I gotta get it covered first.
[28:56.95]I'm sorry, this is not a TikTok video.
[29:00.65]It's gonna take more than 10 seconds for you to see this.
[29:13.54]Speed it up.
[29:14.52]No!
[29:14.86]What do you mean speed it up?
[29:16.76]I'm gonna take my time.
[29:21.31]And this is actually going pretty fast for what I'm making here.
[29:24.14]I need a background, obviously.
[29:31.73]Alright.
[29:32.03]So this is pretty, this is getting close.
[29:33.31]I need to add a little bit of a finesse on here.
[29:35.93]Hold on.
[29:36.67]Yeah.
[29:40.50]Okay.
[29:40.68]Let's like this.
[30:04.33]I gotta get some texture on it.
[30:05.41]Okay.
[30:15.92]Alright, now it's time.
[30:16.86]We've got kind of a background here.
[30:20.08]Gifted Andy.
[30:24.02]It's ruined.
[30:24.84]It is not ruined.
[30:25.78]I'm about to ruin it, though, because painting is not... Okay, Unicorn.
[30:31.71]Unicorn.
[30:34.40]Purple?
[30:38.06]Pink?
[30:41.16]Wait, I need to do outline first.
[30:46.46]White?
[30:47.19]I'm turning it into like unicorn.
[30:48.99]Unicorn is like blue, like light blue.
[30:52.79]White.
[30:55.17]This is gonna, I'm gonna fuck this up.
[30:56.45]Alright, what does a unicorn look like?
[30:59.19]It needs to be perspective.
[31:00.15]Alright.
[31:01.15]It's going to be the front of the unicorn's face.
[31:03.92]It's going to be like this.
[31:04.82]It's kind of a droopy nose.
[31:25.59]What does an animal even look like?
[31:27.13]Alright.
[31:39.18]What the fuck does a horse look like?
[32:07.49]What?
[32:07.73]Oh, I thought the game... I thought I was doing so poorly that the game said you have to leave.
[32:10.81]This kind of looks like a party hat.
[32:36.48]Alright, hold on.
[32:36.98]I'm not done.
[32:49.86]I did the same exact painting the first time.
[32:51.90]The last room.
[32:52.90]The same exact one.
[32:54.70]It's the exact same painting as the first one I did last time.
[32:58.96]Identical.
[32:59.46]It was an alligator.
[33:00.12]The first one was an alligator, wasn't it?
[33:05.37]It actually is the same exact thing.
[33:08.59]I made an alligator painting and it was the same face.
[33:11.71]I know.
[33:13.15]Hold on.
[33:13.51]Let me just get this done.
[33:25.59]You guys don't even know I...
[34:04.06]Yeah, it's like turning this way.
[34:20.49]Unicorns have, um...
[34:32.86]This is fun.
[34:33.88]This is cool.
[34:34.18]Do they have an ass horn?
[34:36.74]This one does.
[34:39.72]I need a thicker brush.
[34:40.56]This is too thin.
[34:40.94]It's got to be way thicker than this.
[34:44.70]Otherwise I sit here all day doing this.
[34:46.03]Alright.
[34:49.39]This painting is for a sister as a gift.
[34:50.91]Alright, let me finish this part.
[34:57.51]Oh, fuck, there's all this empty space over here.
[34:59.47]Um, it's alright, I'll put hay over here.
[35:01.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:03.95]Wait, hold on.
[35:06.11]Wait, one thing at a time.
[35:10.46]Should you be, like, like, munching on hay?
[35:13.76]You know what I mean?
[35:19.04]Like... I need thinner than this.
[35:47.98]Shit, don't go that far.
[36:05.29]Wonderful use of colors.
[36:06.25]Yeah.
[36:07.81]Thanks.
[36:12.47]No, no, no.
[36:12.77]I've got to lighten this up.
[36:14.64]Wait, hay is kind of darker, isn't it?
[36:35.40]Alright, I'll spray paint it too.
[36:39.34]This looks like Dark Uga drew this.
[36:49.51]Is this too big of a brush?
[36:50.31]I don't know, it might be.
[37:01.29]Is this too big?
[37:09.56]I'll fix it.
[37:14.48]Fuck, sorry, I can fix it.
[37:35.27]That looks like that looks OK.
[37:38.12]Control Z. There is no Control Z. It's an art program.
[37:41.86]Wait, that's wrong.
[37:44.28]Okay, so.
[37:44.92]I'm going to be like.
[38:03.27]This looks like a Dark Souls boss.
[38:07.83]It's like half the enemies in Bloodborne look like this.
[38:20.11]What about the ears?
[38:22.09]I don't... What do the horse's ears look like?
[38:23.78]They're not... No, what do they look like?
[38:54.83]Ah, wait a minute.
[38:59.97]Can somebody do me a quick favor and go get a screenshot of the Grandpa is an MLG series I used to do on Machinima and the thumbnail of that series?
[39:16.51]I need it right now.
[39:17.79]I need an image of it right now.
[39:21.69]Right now.
[39:22.63]Somebody get it to me.
[39:37.72]Get it yourself.
[39:38.40]I can't.
[39:38.82]I'm busy.
[39:41.54]Okay.
[39:42.04]So it is what I thought it was going to be.
[39:58.71]It's almost, it's like the same image.
[40:05.71]Okay.
[40:05.97]It's kind of close.
[40:12.24]This is like the, I don't even know.
[40:14.54]This is like a weird de-evolved version of this image.
[40:19.10]I can only do one thing.
[40:20.21]Okay.
[40:22.83]Well that's interesting.
[40:28.56]By the way, if you haven't seen that series, Grandpa is an MLG, Machinima got liquidated.
[40:34.18]It's gone.
[40:43.39]Okay.
[40:44.27]So.
[40:47.11]I can fix it, though.
[40:49.91]I was trying to do the perspective kind of like a fisheye lens in a way.
[40:53.01]I'll fix it.
[40:53.33]This is wrong.
[40:53.89]I'll do the eyes better.
[40:58.82]But for now, we need hay.
[41:45.11]Hold on, I gotta have the lip come up.
[41:50.72]Can you tell me how to use Frap?
[41:55.74]You don't know how different the world was back then, okay?
[42:01.65]doing tutorials on how to do just random shit.
[42:06.59]People were looking for stuff like that.
[42:08.69]Oh, how do I unlock this weapon in Call of Duty, right?
[42:13.04]People made videos on it because it didn't exist.
[42:35.75]I need like teeth.
[42:43.60]Horses have really human teeth, don't they?
[43:09.61]What does a horse's ears look like?
[43:14.77]They go down, right?
[43:22.65]Are they pointy?
[43:31.56]They go... No, wait.
[43:32.80]Hold on.
[43:33.04]They go back.
[43:33.48]They go...
[43:41.46]Search for a horse.
[43:45.28]Yeah, what does a horse's face look like?
[43:51.25]They point up.
[43:52.61]Yeah, they do.
[43:53.13]They're tiny.
[43:58.91]Shit.
[43:59.19]Alright.
[43:59.55]Hold on.
[43:59.89]I gotta fix this then.
[44:00.61]I don't know why I thought they looked like that.
[44:10.62]Um...
[44:23.07]Are you serious?
[45:05.30]I'm hiding it.
[45:34.38]There we go.
[45:38.99]OK, I can fix that up there.
[45:46.70]Let me finish the body.
[45:48.52]That's important.
[45:49.48]Why would I wash this?
[46:22.22]I didn't want to put that there.
[46:23.79]Okay.
[46:52.63]I should in this first.
[47:05.97]I'm going to clean it up, I'll do some line work on it.
[47:41.68]OK, I need to do some line work before I do this.
[47:45.52]Hey, you would hang this up on your fridge if this was an eight year old.
[47:49.84]You would.
[47:53.97]Alright, so I do like dark line, right?
[47:56.17]Yeah.
[48:08.85]Now I got to fill it in first.
[48:09.95]Yeah, I fill it in first.
[48:13.41]I need white.
[48:14.55]Yeah, I need white.
[48:27.35]I would buy this for $100.
[48:28.11]He's 37.
[48:28.81]Yeah, you don't magically just know how to draw because you're 37.
[48:36.10]This is not something that everybody knows how to do.
[48:38.06]It's not like, oh yeah, you're 35 and older, you know how to draw.
[48:42.15]That's not how it works.
[48:44.83]This is a skill that takes time to develop.
[49:04.83]I promise this will look a lot cleaner in a minute.
[49:06.85]You have to trust the process of what I'm doing.
[49:15.24]Once it's cleaned up, everyone's going to be like, oh, well, actually, it looks kind of good.
[49:20.40]And those people get timed out.
[49:23.64]Now, how dare you not believe in me from the very beginning?
[49:31.20]They get timed out for a while, too.
[49:32.98]Like, I'm not gonna have that here, right?
[49:34.42]I'm not gonna have that.
[49:38.72]Yeah, I'm not gonna have that here.
[49:51.55]It's scaring me, and I'm the one that drew it.
[49:57.16]The issue is this double nose thing.
[50:07.78]It looks like Chester Cheetos.
[50:12.22]Unicorn Cousin.
[50:15.21]This is an ad for some hay like cheese dusty snack.
[50:32.18]Imagine hay coming out of a bag.
[50:35.96]It kind of looks like what you smell like.
[50:39.02]You don't know what I smell like, so that's interesting.
[50:44.32]It's not what you think either.
[50:47.91]Oh my god, he must smell so good.
[50:49.45]No.
[50:50.29]Not at all.
[50:50.83]I smell fucking terrible.
[50:52.67]Disgusting.
[50:53.31]I smell awful.
[50:55.45]Everything about me smells bad.
[50:56.67]Everything.
[51:04.40]Like, when I go up and walk up and talk to somebody, and I'm like, oh, hey, what's up?
[51:07.16]They go, oh!
[51:07.56]Because my breath is so fucking bad.
[51:10.40]I need more.
[51:41.17]Now, you know what I smell like?
[51:44.14]I smell like, um... You know that, the Axe Body Wash?
[51:52.11]So, Axe Body Wash.
[51:54.69]I, I, I go...
[51:58.35]in the shower, and I get a mound this high off my hand, and I go, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, and it hits all of my body and shit, and I don't know if you guys like the way it feels, and I mush it all over my hands, and I put it all over my face and all over my body everywhere, and I let it sit there.
[52:30.72]I don't do that.
[52:34.68]Got you.
[52:37.20]You're so far away now.
[52:40.11]It's so funny just how far away you really are.
[52:47.07]Yeah, I got you.
[52:49.77]I got you.
[52:51.05]Yep.
[52:52.28]I was kidding around with you.
[52:54.56]If you're new to the channel, we kind of mess around sometimes.
[52:57.32]Yeah, we kid around a lot.
[52:59.34]Yeah, I got you.
[53:13.47]You are a prince of lies.
[53:24.52]What?
[53:25.40]They have hooves, right?
[53:27.01]Kind of like this.
[53:38.48]And then that's going to be gray.
[54:02.03]I have to call that pretty good hand stability.
[54:10.95]That was pretty good.
[54:14.55]Give the horse underwear?
[54:16.39]Maybe.
[54:16.69]We'll see.
[54:17.90]I will see what inspiration hits me.
[54:20.78]First it was the hay.
[54:21.54]I don't know.
[54:24.08]We'll see.
[54:24.88]I don't know.
[54:25.20]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[54:32.85]I might just get unhappy with this and dropkick this and put two huge shoe prints on it and then throw it away.
[54:39.19]Well, I don't know.
[54:39.97]It depends on my inspiration.
[54:45.49]And then someone will find it and it'll have a ton of value because the artist that didn't like his own material, the shoe print, right?
[54:53.54]That would be kind of interesting.
[54:56.18]This was found in the dumpster or something, right?
[54:58.60]It's got shoe prints on it.
[54:59.38]They kicked it.
[55:01.12]That might be interesting.
[55:20.54]Your life isn't a movie, Jerma.
[55:48.92]What is this?
[55:49.44]It's not done is what it is.
[55:50.90]You can't just come in here and say, what is this?
[55:52.58]Until you see the whole thing.
[55:57.48]I think I'm going to... Let's clean this up.
[56:07.10]Yeah, let me clean this up.
[56:13.18]We're going to go super abstract for the next one.
[56:15.25]I'm telling you.
[56:19.84]I need the thicker brush, this one here.
[56:45.69]I can fix it if I need to.
[57:00.37]I'll redo this line.
[57:11.50]Do you not know how an outline works?
[57:14.06]I know nothing about painting or drawing.
[57:17.51]I just do it when it's fun.
[57:18.95]This is fun.
[57:24.65]Alright.
[57:26.35]What am I going to do here?
[57:27.49]Here.
[57:29.61]I know I have to fix a lot of this.
[57:30.71]Hold on.
[57:31.01]Yeah, give me... Let's get this fixed.
[58:00.90]These are too big.
[58:02.34]It's okay, though.
[58:05.22]These are way too big.
[58:05.92]What do the horse's eyes look like?
[58:18.53]They look like bird eyes, aren't they?
[58:21.27]There's an eye here and an eye here.
[58:23.19]It's like a bird.
[58:27.55]That's how it works, right?
[58:28.49]Yeah.
[58:32.30]Let me fix this, then.
[58:54.31]Howdy, uh, purple.
[58:58.05]What's this?
[58:58.57]Whoa!
[59:10.82]Oh, shit.
[59:11.56]That's way too dark.
[59:30.49]I need this in a... There we go.
[59:32.03]Yeah, give me that.
[59:34.16]Is this better?
[59:34.56]Kind of.
[59:38.36]A little bit.
[59:52.80]I'll fix it in post.
[60:01.12]Very clearly the eyes were here.
[60:03.54]Damn it.
[60:13.66]I can't do subjects.
[60:14.95]I can do, I can do interesting color stuff.
[60:18.93]I can't draw a subject.
[60:20.95]I can make some.
[60:22.25]You'll see.
[60:24.19]I'll fix it in a minute.
[60:34.81]Oh my god damn it.
[60:36.09]I fucking ruined everything.
[60:37.50]I actually just ruined it.
[60:48.64]Not if it's a cyborg guy.
[61:09.98]Good start.
[62:04.96]I'm thinking like Kano from Mortal Kombat, right?
[62:07.34]Alright, now is the purple.
[62:43.06]Okay.
[62:43.72]You ruined it again.
[62:44.40]No, I didn't.
[62:44.84]Because I can work with that.
[62:46.92]There it is.
[62:58.22]I have to clean this workstation up.
[62:59.32]This is awful.
[63:18.82]The horse is awesome now.
[63:19.86]I told you to wait until it was done.
[63:21.42]Everyone's freaking out about it.
[63:22.82]It doesn't look good.
[63:24.84]Just wait until it's done.
[63:25.68]Done, done, done.
[63:26.26]Take a before and after.
[63:31.45]You need to trust me.
[63:48.72]That's kind of scary, actually.
[64:18.14]I'd pay $500,000 for this.
[64:23.60]I would not sell it for $500,000.
[64:25.36]I would be ashamed to sell it to you for that much.
[64:29.27]I would be saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, dude, dude, it's alright.
[64:33.01]In fact, you would probably show up with a briefcase with $100 bills in it, and I'd be holding this in my hand, and be like, oh, dude, I'm gonna give you $500,000 for this.
[64:40.15]I'd be like, dude, just fucking have it.
[64:42.45]Just take it.
[64:43.09]You can just have this.
[64:48.09]Take this.
[65:02.71]Take this from me.
[65:04.71]Alright.
[65:04.91]I need a bigger brush because yeah.
[65:20.31]I'm trying to figure out if I need to just thin this.
[65:24.03]It's gotta be thinner.
[65:24.85]Yeah.
[65:28.69]This edge part can't be here.
[65:31.54]So let's go like this.
[65:32.76]I'll fix the rest.
[66:06.70]Thanks.
[66:19.23]Any more white?
[66:32.73]Yeah, well, maybe we'll do... I'm going to do one of my own.
[66:35.65]And then maybe we could do some abstract stuff.
[66:38.93]Maybe you guys can give me some tools that I could only use or something.
[66:40.91]I don't know how it works, but we'll try it.
[66:50.34]I need to... That word is dirty, if you're wondering why I did that.
[66:52.64]It's going to start to not work.
[66:55.85]Okay.
[66:57.39]We're actually pretty close to being done to do some detail work.
[67:17.49]I don't want to lose this part.
[67:18.45]I need a line here.
[67:20.83]I need more water.
[67:22.41]Water.
[67:22.77]Where's water?
[67:39.60]How do you just place it down?
[67:41.00]Oh, come on.
[67:41.46]How do I put it down just normally?
[67:43.03]No, it's not E. How do I do it?
[67:59.98]Okay, there we go.
[68:02.28]Where's my brush?
[68:03.64]Good.
[68:04.80]Okay, so I'm just going to fill this in and we can start to actually make some cool changes here.
[68:16.07]I've got to kind of remember where some of this stuff was.
[68:17.73]Because there's a line that needs to be here.
[68:34.80]does this look like this looks like something what does this actually look like it looks like um it's I don't know somebody will see it right no no no not sans something else the dog from Toy Story
[69:10.58]Dog from Toy Story.
[69:11.66]It looks like that.
[69:12.28]Hold on.
[69:16.70]Toy Story.
[69:17.62]Toy Story Dog.
[69:22.51]No, it does not.
[69:41.29]Because remember, he's like... Like, chewing.
[69:45.93]Like that.
[69:46.85]So now we got that done.
[69:49.23]Okay, I gotta be very careful here, because this is kind of the way I want it.
[69:51.86]I just have to do some line work.
[70:01.70]Yeah, alright, give me this.
[70:07.03]What the hell just happened?
[70:43.63]I'm concentrating, relax.
[70:51.43]I'll put some more Kano eye smoke in a minute.
[71:02.38]Actually, this is kind of good.
[71:03.14]I can get rid of the big, chunky, gross part.
[71:22.42]I gotta give it a little bit of texture at the bottom, because it's like, coming out.
[71:38.65]Alright.
[71:39.75]Almost there.
[71:40.99]We'll do some more touch-up work later.
[71:46.77]But for the most part, this is almost ready to start doing some detail of the face.
[72:05.30]Why is this different color?
[72:18.11]Am I getting paid for this?
[72:21.03]Oh, this is a birthday present.
[72:25.22]Hmm.
[72:28.66]It's a birthday present.
[72:30.10]I can't just like send you like a $50 gift card to Applebee's.
[72:35.60]And have it be a card with a cat on it, a little kitten with a party hat on.
[72:43.55]And then write, hey, hey, scratch this off your list.
[72:48.97]Dinner's on me tonight.
[72:50.79]With like a cat scratch.
[72:52.75]Why can't I just do that?
[73:09.42]Okay, let's do this.
[73:15.26]I actually, I'm just going to, I can fix this in a minute because I'm going to put some, uh, well, that's more lines on top of it.
[73:22.35]So it doesn't look like it's in front.
[73:23.69]The perspective is going to change.
[73:25.37]So just wait, it'll be fine.
[73:38.58]How come there's no fifth leg?
[73:41.60]If you want me to draw a horse dick... I'm sorry, that's not going to happen on this stream.
[73:54.37]This is actually tricky, but whatever.
[73:55.49]I need it to be more...
[74:07.57]This is gonna start to look weird.
[74:10.73]Okay, there we go, that's better.
[74:26.31]It's fine, don't worry.
[74:38.60]I don't want to mess with this because it's already under his lip.
[74:43.23]Okay.
[74:46.49]This is the leg that's in front of the camera the most.
[74:49.81]That's got to be the biggest one.
[74:54.37]Alright, it's time to start doing this.
[74:55.81]It's time to actually care about this.
[74:59.78]Alright, I don't want to screw this up.
[75:01.48]Let me think how this would actually look with the same type of
[75:14.16]Yeah, it's like... Kinda looks like...
[75:43.16]HUH?! !
[75:45.10]Hey!
[75:46.64]Wait, I was like, what happened?
[75:48.40]What are you talking about?
[75:49.32]What?
[75:51.00]Where'd you get this?
[75:56.42]I'm so confused.
[75:58.32]What's going on?
[76:05.75]Did I steal this?
[76:06.93]Whose is this?
[76:14.17]The snoozing copter drew this.
[76:30.06]That's just the ice cream truck version of that.
[76:33.48]What you drew.
[76:41.84]Wow.
[76:43.17]That's unbelievable.
[76:44.14]Alright.
[76:44.42]Well, cool.
[76:45.12]Should I stop?
[76:46.18]Should I stop my painting?
[76:55.06]Wow.
[76:55.63]That's actually awesome.
[76:56.91]Alright.
[76:57.19]Well, Susan Carpenter, that's fucking awesome.
[77:03.69]I feel like I can't even make mine now.
[77:09.81]This is the part of the movie, Jerma, your life's not a movie.
[77:13.09]I don't care.
[77:14.49]This is the part of the movie when we're at the talent show and we both did the same thing and mine sucks.
[77:21.66]And I have to figure out what I'm going to do instead.
[77:24.26]And the guy with the headset comes over.
[77:26.48]He's like, hey, you ready to show what you did for the talent show?
[77:29.60]And I'm just like, um...
[77:32.57]Uh, yeah!
[77:33.95]And then I come up with a dance routine that wins everybody over.
[77:37.97]And I beat your painting, by the way.
[77:43.87]Should I just get up and dance?
[77:49.98]And, ladies and gentlemen, here he is, showcasing his art.
[77:55.86]Jeremy Elbertson!
[77:57.30]And I walk on stage, and I'm, like, fucking nervous, sweating, and I grab the mic, and it goes...
[78:01.82]Okay, everybody.
[78:03.06]Well, I was going to draw something and then like really sad kind of uplifting music starts playing.
[78:09.54]Well, I was going to draw for you today, but I was going to bring you a painting.
[78:12.70]But I felt like, no, I wanted to do something different.
[78:17.83]You inspired them.
[78:19.19]Why are you acting like this?
[78:22.61]It's not a talent show.
[78:24.37]They just were inspired by what you were doing.
[78:28.16]Yeah.
[78:28.38]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[78:33.75]Why are you so insecure?
[78:34.81]I'm just fucking around.
[78:43.30]That was a phenomenal painting, though.
[78:44.62]Seriously.
[78:46.66]But check mine out.
[78:49.40]Oh, yeah?
[78:49.88]Check mine out.
[78:55.56]I might not be the fastest, the brightest.
[78:59.91]I might not have what it takes.
[79:00.91]But there's something that I do know.
[79:04.61]I have perseverance.
[79:07.62]And I have gumption.
[79:15.50]And then a Fatboy Slim song comes on.
[79:17.76]And I start doing like a Napoleon Dynamite dance.
[79:27.37]You're an anime character, yeah.
[79:30.87]Shut up, help, help.
[79:33.39]Help with what?
[79:33.77]What's wrong?
[79:35.58]Alright, so I need to make the lip go... I can fix this, hold on.
[80:03.09]Oh, yayay.
[80:08.70]I think I'll be alright.
[80:09.66]Just have to do more of the A. Alright, we gotta make sure the head is correct.
[80:17.01]This is the moment of truth.
[80:23.21]It's perfect!
[80:55.25]I need the other eye.
[81:07.32]Teeth too.
[81:08.30]Shit.
[81:08.78]Alright.
[81:18.18]It's a moose.
[81:19.54]It does kind of look like a moose.
[81:27.51]Snoozing copter.
[81:28.11]I didn't mean to show off.
[81:29.09]I just wanted to draw along like Bob Ross.
[81:31.05]Your vision.
[81:32.55]No, I'm... Don't take it that way.
[81:35.74]I'm just messing around, man.
[81:36.58]It was awesome.
[81:39.96]It was actually fucking... It was a great... It was a great part of this drape, actually.
[81:43.52]It was funny.
[81:46.38]Kind of looks like a duck.
[81:52.49]It does kind of look like a duck.
[81:54.79]What about the other eye?
[81:55.57]What should I do with the other eye?
[82:00.14]I need the nostrils too.
[82:29.15]It just kind of looks like he has rotten teeth.
[82:31.37]He's got fucked up rotten teeth.
[82:45.56]Okay.
[82:46.76]I can fix this if I go like this.
[82:50.00]Alright.
[82:50.52]I gotta change some things here.
[82:51.52]I need white.
[82:54.98]Do I still have any white left in here?
[82:56.68]No, of course not.
[82:59.09]Wait, there's a spongy tool?
[83:00.33]Hold on.
[83:14.36]I didn't do anything.
[83:17.28]I need white.
[83:18.52]I need to do teeth.
[83:20.82]And then I need to do the eye and then do some detail work and I'm done.
[83:24.80]It looks pretty good from far away.
[83:39.76]Okay, let's do some teeth.
[84:24.17]Alright.
[84:25.29]I'm actually not unhappy with this.
[84:29.34]Oh fuck, I have to do it in the other color.
[85:07.95]Okay, that looks good.
[85:51.96]I'm not gonna say anything.
[86:23.52]Okay, now I just need to add a little bit in there.
[86:31.54]Should there be a shoulder coming out or something here?
[86:33.46]This feels weird.
[86:34.02]Like it cuts off too quick.
[86:36.43]You know what I'm saying?
[86:37.01]Kind of have like a little bump like here.
[86:39.95]That makes sense, right?
[86:40.69]Does that make sense?
[86:43.57]I hope it makes sense.
[86:44.37]I hope so.
[86:45.45]Because I'm just going to do it.
[86:46.37]Fuck, it looks terrible.
[86:52.23]Hold on.
[87:03.22]Does that make any sense?
[87:05.97]I don't know.
[87:06.25]We'll find out.
[88:02.11]Does this game still have background music?
[88:03.85]Can you not hear anything?
[88:11.88]Has it been quiet the whole time?
[88:16.62]Oh, shit.
[88:17.18]Sorry.
[88:28.69]Let me see if this works.
[88:31.27]Because now...
[88:35.98]Alright.
[88:39.24]Once the detail work comes out, this will actually look a little better.
[88:41.58]It's gonna look weird, and it's gonna look like a weird cartoon, but whatever.
[88:44.78]I think it's gonna be fine.
[88:48.02]And then I'm done.
[88:48.74]I'm done after this, because I want to do another painting.
[88:50.78]I want you guys to choose.
[89:14.94]Something about it doesn't look right, but whatever.
[89:16.30]It needs another eye.
[89:29.52]Alright, so what should I do for this eye?
[89:35.48]How about just like purple?
[89:41.69]Is this a bit?
[89:42.25]I don't know how to draw.
[89:45.34]I mean, is not knowing how to do something a routine?
[89:48.78]No, I just don't know how to draw.
[90:07.56]Wait, do you think I'm pretending to not know how to draw and I actually do and I'm going to do the next one and it's going to be fucking sick?
[90:14.78]That actually would be kind of funny.
[90:41.84]I like the texture on that.
[90:44.44]Ooh, I like it.
[90:46.26]You idiot.
[90:48.97]You fucking ruined it.
[90:49.83]I'm doing the two feet print.
[90:53.53]Just stick right in the middle.
[90:56.52]I'm going to jump and lay out on my back so my back is parallel to the ground and kick as hard as I can right here into the front.
[91:04.22]Because I just fucked that up.
[91:19.57]Getting close to being done.
[91:29.16]Eyebrows.
[91:29.58]Do horses have eyebrows?
[91:32.54]They do, right?
[91:33.91]Kind of.
[91:34.17]This one's going to have eyebrows.
[92:01.95]Okay.
[92:03.42]They have this though, I know for a fact.
[92:13.84]Like a little opening, right?
[92:19.47]Looks a little strange, but whatever.
[92:34.24]There needs to be more texture here.
[92:35.71]Alright.
[92:36.17]I need texture, texture, texture, texture, texture.
[92:52.69]Like that.
[92:59.55]Here we go.
[93:01.16]This is going to ruin it or it's going to make it look much better.
[93:04.04]Find out.
[93:31.99]Fuck you, it's glowing.
[93:36.46]Actually glowing.
[93:40.92]Yeah.
[94:37.92]I'm fine.
[94:38.44]It's fine.
[94:38.90]It actually looks cool.
[94:45.36]I was trying to smudge it a little.
[94:46.62]That actually looks kinda cool.
[95:34.45]Look at how magical this is.
[95:35.59]What do you mean stop, stop, stop, stop, what?
[95:44.77]I think it looks better than it did.
[95:47.06]Now we truly go through and fix the details.
[96:41.35]I want to do some more line work.
[96:45.16]Where's the hair?
[96:45.80]I don't have the tool to do that.
[96:53.34]I gotta fix this and then do one more pass of the line.
[96:56.27]Then I'm done and I'm going to sell it to my sister or an Applebee's gift card.
[97:02.21]Maybe should the outline be purple?
[97:11.72]Yeah.
[97:15.47]You made an NFT.
[97:29.86]Yeah, but I mean, the combination of the hay in the mouth and the two Kano eyes, it's got to be worth at least one Ethereum.
[98:00.17]I actually don't think I want to add that much more line stuff.
[98:02.84]Yeah, I don't like that.
[98:04.50]Let's fix that right now.
[98:05.54]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, before it dries.
[98:09.69]That's alright.
[98:10.15]Okay, so he's... Why does this have white on it?
[98:11.89]Why does this have white on it?
[98:24.48]Oh my god, he's phasing into reality.
[98:26.99]Oh my goodness, this is worth it.
[98:29.11]25 people.
[98:31.11]He's phasing in.
[98:32.27]Are you kidding me?
[99:35.50]This is white.
[99:40.22]What the fuck?
[99:48.49]Alright, it's time for the finishing touch.
[100:29.86]Two shoe prints Well, so it would be like
[100:59.50]that kind of looks like like two feet prints that's my signature
[101:27.64]Dude, you're cooked.
[101:28.74]I'm fine.
[101:29.30]Alright, how do I get this off the wall?
[101:35.79]Why is it brown?
[101:36.73]Because I got dirty ass feet.
[101:40.35]Okay.
[101:41.29]There it is.
[101:42.59]It's complete.
[101:45.23]It's time to... I'm going to give you 20 seconds.
[101:49.61]Alright, here you go.
[101:50.21]You ready?
[101:52.21]30 seconds.
[101:52.71]Rate my painting.
[101:57.65]What do you think?
[101:58.03]Is it between 0 and 10?
[102:02.14]I think you guys are breaking it.
[102:26.10]And...
[102:29.41]A 6.5!
[102:31.41]That's not bad.
[102:34.45]I'm okay with that.
[102:35.23]Alright, let's send it.
[102:53.95]Okay.
[102:55.39]How much money?
[102:55.75]I just made money?
[103:00.13]How do you clean?
[103:00.75]Is that a good wah or a bad wah?
[103:13.44]Is that a... Is that a Waluigi wah?
[103:18.31]Like you fell off the side of a cliff?
[103:20.25]Wile E. Coyote style?
[103:21.35]Or is that a wow?
[103:23.21]This is great.
[103:34.42]OK.
[103:35.82]I gotta go to my email.
[103:45.96]Cleaning is more fun than painting.
[103:47.18]For me.
[103:55.70]I love this is I love this.
[104:02.13]Is there a business where you can just kind of clean, like paint off a wall like this?
[104:09.27]Because around here they have the stuff where you break things.
[104:14.71]I don't know what's going on with the... Oh, let's have it go in and you smash stuff with a hammer.
[104:20.45]I want where you clean stuff.
[104:22.13]I want to power wash a dirty driveway.
[104:26.13]I want to use a sponge on like a dirty wall and clean it.
[104:34.15]Should I just be like a janitor?
[104:36.59]Be a power washer?
[104:39.09]Do power washing.
[104:41.37]Yeah, but here's the thing.
[104:45.51]I wouldn't be able to do a professional job doing it, right?
[104:50.57]It's not like, oh, I'll just do power washing.
[104:52.41]I'll sell a power washing business.
[104:54.98]No, no, no.
[104:55.34]I just want to clean dirt off the wall.
[104:58.22]I don't think I'll do very well.
[105:02.09]Right?
[105:02.51]Like, I just want to do it just... Oh, we like put dirt on this wall and you just spray it off.
[105:21.57]It's like a weed store.
[105:24.71]You go in and you smoke... There's like a thousand different kinds of joints.
[105:27.99]You pick which one you want, you smoke it.
[105:31.06]And then they bring you into the room where you could just play with a bunch of toys.
[105:38.34]Dude, man, you can... Yeah, you could... By the way, you can power wash this wall.
[105:41.24]It's like a 15-foot wall.
[105:42.38]Power wash it, man.
[105:44.24]What?
[105:44.92]Yeah.
[105:45.62]Or you can just watch me do it.
[105:47.24]Oh, yeah!
[105:47.98]Can I sit in the chair and watch you do it?
[105:49.57]Hey, bro.
[105:54.87]You know those baby toys that we have at the doctor's offices?
[105:59.01]We got a huge one.
[106:00.49]Oh, you put the beads around with the wire.
[106:03.35]You do?
[106:06.59]Yeah, man.
[106:07.27]Hey, you know what?
[106:07.83]You don't have to play with it.
[106:08.51]You can just watch me.
[106:09.63]Oh, yeah.
[106:10.17]Can I just watch you do it?
[106:23.51]Don't operate machinery.
[106:24.71]No, I'm not talking about like heavy machinery.
[106:28.58]I'm talking about just like easy toys or something.
[106:31.46]Like I could watch somebody power watch a driveway while I'm high.
[106:42.25]Dude, why don't you just find a power washing business and be like, hey, can I just like come with you to a job and just get high and I'll pay you just to sit there in a chair and just watch the power washing.
[106:56.74]I could probably just do that.
[107:05.33]A ride-along power... Yeah!
[107:08.27]A ride-along power washing thing.
[107:11.77]What a weirdo.
[107:23.14]Hey, can I come with you to the doctor's so I can just play with the toy in the waiting room?
[107:29.58]That's weird.
[107:30.97]That's not... That one won't work.
[107:34.52]That one's not going to work.
[107:37.28]Just buy the toy.
[107:48.73]Hey, hot doctor asked you to power watch and power wash the driveway.
[108:03.29]Sorry, I don't mean to annoy you.
[108:04.31]I just want to watch the surgery.
[108:09.78]Literally just buy it, dude.
[108:10.72]It's called a bead maze.
[108:20.68]Where's the trash?
[108:22.94]No, you're fucking with my stupid scenario that I'm coming up with.
[108:30.67]Be honest with me.
[108:32.03]What is a job or a business that you really don't think you could do that takes skill to do that you would just like to watch?
[108:39.21]Like wood cutting.
[108:40.47]Can I just watch somebody cut wood?
[108:42.53]But I want to be there.
[108:44.43]When you watch it on a video, it's like, oh, the person's like chopping the wood.
[108:48.70]It's like, oh, that's so cool.
[108:50.32]But I want to be there.
[108:51.00]I want to smell the wood.
[108:52.10]I want to be there and just hear the sounds and just be out in the woods just hanging out.
[108:56.26]Can I just watch somebody cut wood?
[109:02.57]with a big axe just chopping the wood painting yeah sculpting porn no I don't I don't want to watch someone make porn that's not what I don't no I no I'm talking about I don't I'm talking about just satisfying stuff
[109:37.93]I think this is cleaning up.
[109:38.77]So now let's go check the email.
[109:47.96]I just received my unicorn.
[109:48.92]While I have the digital version, the real painting will take a little longer.
[109:52.18]Your unicorn is a little weird, but let's just say it's approved.
[109:56.12]I will name it Ragnarok because it looks like it will bring about the apocalypse.
[110:05.86]Oh, wait, this is my sister.
[110:08.64]It's a great name.
[110:09.26]You're just jealous of my unicorn naming skills.
[110:10.98]But anyway, I'm having an online call with some friends of mine.
[110:14.10]I'm showing them your painting.
[110:15.12]Good luck with your artist stuff and everything.
[110:17.17]What do you mean?
[110:21.29]Good luck with your artist stuff.
[110:22.71]What is that?
[110:23.19]Okay.
[110:32.39]Oh, cool.
[110:32.71]I'm ready.
[110:42.13]Your artist stuff.
[110:47.39]Okay.
[110:50.06]Let's go.
[110:53.48]You can paint whatever you want.
[110:54.76]Follow your creative impulses.

[111:01.26]Wait, I can make a, I can do a printer.
[111:04.81]Cool.
[111:04.99]Alright, let's do it.
[111:07.81]So what do I got?
[111:13.79]Now what?
[111:14.57]You don't have any commissions yet.
[111:15.65]Should I just do whatever I want?
[111:27.56]Um, challenge my skills?
[111:35.22]Which one?
[111:36.28]You forgot the email that you just read.
[111:37.72]Okay.
[111:46.28]I think I just have to make stuff and sell it.
[111:57.24]Make the horror?
[111:57.82]I don't think I can.
[112:02.06]That's way too big.
[112:03.62]No, no, no.
[112:04.40]Give me something else.
[112:07.74]I want a little one.
[112:10.07]We're going to get a little one.
[112:22.77]This is too big.
[112:23.33]I just want a small one.
[112:24.64]Here we go.
[112:36.11]I need an easel.
[112:36.57]Where's an easel?
[112:37.11]There it is.
[112:57.26]This thing out.
[113:00.90]Okay.
[113:07.18]An ICU.
[113:07.48]Yeah, it is an ICU.
[113:08.34]Alright, so what am I gonna... I gotta do something quick.
[113:10.22]Without thinking about it.
[113:11.14]I'm thinking... Just don't think.
[113:18.07]Just do it.
[113:18.47]Just don't think.
[113:18.95]I'm not gonna think.
[113:19.83]I'm just gonna do it.
[113:24.37]I don't wanna see any tools yet.
[113:34.26]What am I feeling?
[113:35.36]I'm feeling a... What color am I feeling?
[113:40.59]Slate.
[113:41.45]Yeah.
[113:42.11]Slate.
[113:43.21]Yep.
[113:51.53]What other colors am I feeling?
[113:52.47]Slate?
[113:54.61]I'm feeling... A little deeper of a slate blue.
[114:02.66]I'm also feeling...
[114:05.97]Yeah, sand all of.
[114:16.30]OK.
[114:22.86]Maybe a bright yellow.
[114:26.67]Let's go.
[114:27.01]I'm not going to think I'm just going to go for it.
[114:32.73]I need a bucket of water.
[114:35.03]Alright, we're going to do we start with.
[114:39.17]This.
[114:58.58]Tornado of a fury of wind.
[115:04.69]and rock.
[115:48.09]No!
[116:25.22]Where did the fucking yellow come from?
[116:26.50]Oh, actually kind of cool.
[117:20.53]Why would you do that?
[118:43.50]I need the inspiration!
[118:55.33]I need a small, really thin one.
[119:05.32]I need a thin brush.
[119:06.92]A really small one.
[119:07.72]Can I buy it?
[119:08.24]Where can I buy it?
[119:08.78]From the computer?
[119:21.10]I can't access the store?
[119:24.66]What?
[119:29.28]Where's the little paintbrush?
[119:30.28]Okay, here we go.
[119:37.22]That's good.
[119:44.72]Don't think too hard about it.
[119:45.56]Just do it.
[120:22.89]Give me the sponge.
[120:23.39]Quick, quick, quick.
[120:24.11]Sponge, sponge, sponge, sponge, sponge.
[120:25.45]I hope this works.
[120:31.74]Just trust it, right?
[120:33.64]Just trust it.
[120:34.16]I didn't do what I wanted to do.
[120:49.10]I thought I was going to smudge it.
[120:52.08]I didn't, I thought, okay, because I thought, so I wet it and I, I tried to go like this to get the water off and I thought I was going to smudge it.
[121:07.25]That was kind of cool.
[121:09.79]You have to use a blender tool.
[121:10.97]I don't have it.
[121:11.55]I thought I could like smudge it with a sponge.
[121:13.46]And just go like wham!
[121:14.54]So it looked like a gust of wind.
[121:17.02]Why wet it first?
[121:18.10]I didn't want any paint on it.
[121:20.08]And then I thought if I like did it on the ground for a minute.
[121:22.40]And like did like over here for a second it would be not wet anymore.
[121:26.62]Um.
[121:28.70]It's okay.
[121:30.32]This actually might be kind of cool.
[121:31.94]If I can salvage it.
[121:33.31]Which I'll try.
[121:37.81]Actually, wait a minute.
[121:48.53]That might have been a good thing.
[122:07.80]Actually, not really a bad thing.
[122:32.53]Did they see this fucking swirling action?
[122:34.91]Do you see that?
[123:27.95]Jerma, quick, cut your ear off.
[123:29.55]What?
[126:16.39]Yeah, he's like, rawr!
[126:18.88]Okay. ...
[127:17.09]Yeah, you can faintly... I want you to be able to faintly see the face.
[127:20.78]I need one more thing to put the cherry on top of this.
[127:23.54]Yeah, be careful.
[127:23.94]I don't want to screw it up.
[127:28.06]Oh, I know.
[127:28.34]I'll smudge it with this.
[127:29.08]I only have $71.
[127:33.32]I feel like there needs to be something else in the middle.
[127:46.94]Is this too much, or is it good?
[127:54.28]Need a cloud?
[127:54.90]Okay, what if I do this?
[127:59.02]I'm talking like that.
[128:01.09]Very faint.
[128:07.23]Now it's done.
[128:09.11]Sell it.
[128:16.03]How do I sell this?
[128:29.08]This is trash.
[128:38.37]Oh, OK.
[128:40.13]Flip it on.
[128:50.93]OK, what do you give this rating?
[128:57.09]Too much light on it.
[128:58.29]I would mood light this.
[128:59.29]What do you think?
[129:21.73]Oh, I got a... Did I sell it?
[129:27.17]7.5.
[129:27.23]Okay, cool.
[129:28.36]That's not bad.
[129:28.82]Isn't there a bunch of weird shit too?
[129:35.10]Oh, because I'm in like story mode.
[129:36.24]I get it.
[129:40.12]There's like a paint cannon.
[129:41.51]There's a lot of cool stuff to do.
[129:42.85]Should I just keep... Should I play this?
[129:44.83]More?
[129:46.11]Would you guys want to see more of this?
[129:46.91]How do you guys feel?
[129:53.19]Yeah?
[129:55.44]Okay.
[129:59.85]Maybe I'll just come back to this in a couple days or something.
[130:04.35]You guys having a good time?
[130:10.45]Alright, we'll play for like another half an hour.
[130:11.79]I want to play multiverses.
[130:18.80]Should I just play this literally in like two or three days?
[130:21.68]That's what we're doing when I come back?
[130:25.11]Okay.
[130:26.95]Yeah, we'll just do this again on this weekend or whatever it is.
[130:30.94]I'm having fun.
[130:31.50]It's just a fun game just to chill and play.
[130:34.48]Alright, let's get one more going here.
[130:35.68]How about you guys can... You guys decide.
[130:39.42]Alright, challenge my skills.
[130:48.22]Probably need a little longer.
[130:55.60]Paint with two colors.
[130:57.30]Rotating easel only in one minute to paint.
[131:07.05]Uh-oh.
[131:13.36]And the winner is rotating easel only.
[131:20.24]Rotating easel?
[131:25.88]How do I do that?
[131:35.31]Small easel?
[131:46.67]Where is it?
[131:50.65]Make the canvas spin.
[131:51.93]Yeah, how do I do that?
[131:52.79]Can I do that from here?
[131:55.37]Set it to auto rotate.
[132:06.92]The blue attachment on the easel.
[132:10.58]Oh, okay.
[132:16.04]Let me see.
[132:16.58]There it is.
[132:20.26]I need a bigger canvas than this.
[132:22.62]I'll save this one for later.
[132:25.57]Let's get a... I guess that's the only size I can do.
[132:31.47]That's fine.
[132:34.89]Put it on here, you said.
[132:39.35]The blue one?
[132:42.95]You need to buy a new easel.
[132:46.87]Oh, really?
[132:50.96]That's not your easel.
[132:53.08]What the hell is this then?
[132:55.72]You don't have the one that rotates yet.
[132:57.52]Oh.
[133:00.06]Well, do another challenge.
[133:11.78]Only spray paint?
[133:13.36]30 seconds to paint or use a single tool.
[133:32.48]Looks like spray paint's going to win by a lot.
[133:34.44]Alright, I'm going to make... What can you even do with spray paint?
[133:40.76]I'm going to do a lot of blues.
[133:41.63]Maybe green.
[133:46.93]I think that looks alright.
[133:47.77]Maybe green and... Oh, I got some points.
[133:54.25]How about this?
[133:55.54]Only spray paint.
[134:00.22]How's this look?
[134:04.65]Let's get a let's get a blue background.
[134:11.72]I'm going to saturate this completely by the way.
[134:13.64]Complete saturation.
[134:28.26]Can't even see what the hell I'm doing.
[134:33.95]Am I even on the screen?
[134:35.63]There we go.
[134:47.74]Press F. Oh.
[134:54.56]Scattered?
[135:02.10]Excuse me?
[135:02.96]How does that make any sense?
[135:03.82]What just happened?
[135:05.66]How am I painting the windows?
[135:07.02]Alright, that looks good.
[135:35.63]I kind of like that.
[135:36.27]Alright, now we're going to do... Not much I can do with spray paint.
[135:40.17]How about... Okay, we're going to do this color.
[135:44.12]This color.
[135:45.62]Yeah, we're going to do this color here.
[135:48.50]Oh, I got... This one's going to come up because I have a seafoam.
[136:22.39]so
[137:16.82]call this one the flu.
[137:23.07]I call this one microscopic germs.
[138:37.46]Look at all the layers.
[140:26.55]Get a load of that one.
[140:38.22]Get a load of that one.
[140:59.96]know why I want to do this but I I want to do this I don't know why I want to do this but I'm gonna do it something's making me do this I'm just like hey do this now you should definitely do this so
[142:02.07]Thank you.
[142:59.43]Done!
[143:01.58]Sorry I really concentrated on that one.
[143:17.52]Thank you.
[143:46.76]I added so many layers that... You can't even see the other layers.
[143:51.46]It was perfect before and I kind of fucked it up, but whatever.
[143:58.17]I actually screwed it up.
[143:59.67]But that's fine.
[144:01.43]It's art.
[144:04.90]Ooh.
[144:05.30]Okay, well...
[144:16.83]6.3 ain't bad.
[144:17.85]Alright, one more.
[144:20.85]Let's do one more challenge and then I'm going to play multiverses.
[144:35.48]Eyes closed.
[144:36.70]Oh, no, no, no.
[144:37.94]Alright.
[144:39.30]I need a small canvas for this.
[144:47.13]Is that too small?
[144:50.39]Just a one by one.
[144:51.07]Alright, eyes closed.
[145:01.77]I need to get set.
[145:02.99]I feel like I did this one already.
[145:04.23]But alright, let me just get rid of this.
[145:12.47]Use the huge canvas?
[145:13.79]Big canvas, big canvas.
[145:14.79]But how am I going to ever... I'm not going to be able to go up or down.
[145:17.07]Okay, let me get my tools ready.
[145:32.10]This is going to be right here.
[145:34.60]You are stupid.
[145:46.07]Okay, there's that.
[145:48.03]I want a new easel.
[145:49.08]I don't want an easel.
[145:49.98]I want to be able to remember where paint is.
[145:53.38]Over here.
[145:53.72]An easel would be too hard.
[145:57.10]I need to block it out.
[145:58.04]So from here, it's... One.
[146:04.47]One, two.
[146:05.41]I need like three colors.
[146:06.73]Okay.
[146:06.95]So let's do that.
[146:10.51]We're going to go with...
[146:14.49]How about a, I don't know, this kind of lavender?
[146:17.01]Actually, I do need an easel.
[146:27.60]I need a ton of it.
[146:28.48]Because I need to be able to miss.
[146:48.57]I think that looks like delicious.
[146:50.21]OK, lavender.
[146:54.45]Maybe a. One of the light blue, maybe.
[147:00.03]White.
[147:03.53]Well, maybe one of these.
[147:04.25]How's this?
[147:06.13]It's jello, grapes, giddles.
[147:08.13]I haven't amount of money.
[147:17.61]Minus $3.
[147:21.50]What?
[147:21.76]I'm in debt right now?
[147:23.32]That's weird.
[147:25.04]What do you think?
[147:25.44]Like this?
[147:25.80]I like an orange or something.
[147:28.13]Yeah, orange.
[147:28.73]Like that.
[147:50.57]I have a plan if this doesn't work.
[147:54.03]And then what?
[147:54.39]Maybe light green?
[147:57.55]You need to put a blindfold on?
[147:59.29]No, I don't.
[147:59.79]I'm not going to cheat.
[148:10.16]I'm thinking of green.
[148:11.81]Skittles?
[148:12.29]Yeah, like the Skittles Tropical.
[148:19.71]Oh, maybe gray.
[148:21.87]Or a dark red?
[148:23.71]What do you think?
[148:28.78]Just paint a hot dog.
[148:30.92]Turn off the monitor.
[148:36.37]Light green?
[148:38.83]Like a lime green?
[148:39.95]Oh, yeah, that might work.
[148:40.61]Yeah, let's do that.
[148:54.84]I don't even know what I'm going to do with this, though.
[148:56.38]If I can't see what I'm doing on a huge canvas, it's going to be a mess.
[149:00.22]I'm just going to let it do... I'm going to let my body decide what it's going to just go for it.
[149:06.95]Okay.
[149:07.61]So in the middle, we have orange.
[149:13.65]I need to be able to reach the whole canvas.
[149:16.11]I think that's good.
[149:16.83]I need my roller.
[149:21.70]Can I reach it?
[149:25.99]Okay, I can reach the whole canvas from here.
[149:28.89]And now I got my brushes.
[149:32.07]Okay, how do I prove to you guys that I can't see?
[149:34.66]Um... I have to put a bag on my head or something?
[149:39.18]Hold on.
[149:39.84]Give me one sec.
[149:44.46]I don't have a blindfold.
[149:45.54]Where am I gonna
[149:57.65]Let me see if I can find something.
[153:17.77]OK, I found something.
[153:21.25]This is going to work.
[153:22.99]Not see through or anything.
[153:28.41]It's.
[153:31.99]No, it's not a duck beanie.
[153:36.61]I think I can just do this.
[153:39.39]So I was at the G4 studios to do obviously name your price and hey, Donna.
[153:45.98]I got this G4 thing.
[153:48.30]I don't know what this is.
[153:49.66]It's like a cloth.
[153:52.40]I can just go like this?
[153:53.94]Wait, does that work?
[153:56.71]I can't see through this.
[153:59.63]It's pretty breathable.
[154:00.41]Do I wear a G4 ad?
[154:06.09]I didn't steal it.
[154:07.11]What do you mean I stole it?
[154:08.17]No, I didn't.
[154:15.68]No, they gave this to me.
[154:17.52]They said, hey man, here's some cool stuff.
[154:19.97]I didn't steal this.
[154:21.09]I didn't take this from the green room.
[154:25.87]Alright, hey.
[154:27.47]G4 TV!
[154:28.03]You just saw in real time me fuck that up.
[154:30.89]I thought you were right here.
[154:32.07]Because that's where you usually are.
[154:34.37]You're over there now.
[154:35.85]And I did the thing where I looked into the camera and it's not the right spot.
[154:40.88]Alright, here we go.
[154:42.44]Do I have a time limit?
[154:47.68]You're censoring your face with a G4 ad.
[154:49.44]That's funny.
[154:50.22]That's fine.
[154:50.62]I don't care.
[154:52.24]Alright.
[154:53.14]G4!
[154:54.78]Here we are!
[154:56.94]This stream is not affiliated with G4 in any way at the moment right now.
[155:01.88]G4 is not part of this stream here.
[155:04.25]This is a cool towel that I got and it's pretty cool.
[155:07.83]And I'm using it to blindfold myself.
[155:09.73]Make sure that I make that very clear.
[155:12.59]Alright, let's go!
[155:15.03]How much is my time limit?
[155:19.04]But I will say, G4, thanks for having me.
[155:21.34]That was a really fun time.
[155:22.34]The studio was really cool.
[155:24.49]Alright!
[155:25.79]Okay.
[155:27.37]Am I in?
[155:27.75]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[155:29.81]What, in like five minutes?
[155:35.17]There's no possible way I'm gonna know where I am.
[155:49.29]Finding the paint is half this whole thing.
[155:58.59]Is it not right here?
[155:59.31]I don't know where the paint is.
[156:31.59]I don't know.
[156:32.09]Can I reset?
[156:34.11]Let me reset.
[156:37.01]Oh, I was right there.
[156:37.65]Alright, hold on.
[156:38.22]Let me reset.
[156:48.44]And... Okay, make sure I can't see.
[156:50.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[156:52.31]I didn't know where I was starting.
[156:53.73]Where's my WASD?
[156:54.57]I don't know where that is.
[156:55.11]Alright, let's go.
[156:57.77]So straight over here, left, straight, down.
[157:01.79]Do I have paint?
[157:28.00]Okay, I heard that.
[157:36.15]I can't... Usually, it makes like a little plop noise, doesn't it?
[157:39.51]When you touch it?
[158:00.22]Wait, where am I?
[158:05.36]I hear splashing.
[158:13.35]Why did I just hear splashing?
[158:16.87]I think I'm next to the bucket, which means... Oh, hold on.
[158:21.25]I heard something.
[158:29.67]This is not, it's just impossible.
[158:31.47]If I had paint already on the brush and I could just cycle through it or something.
[158:43.86]Am I too far away from the table?
[159:00.28]I think I'm too far away.
[159:01.08]Alright, I'm still on the ground.
[159:04.18]Why would I not be on the ground?
[159:19.55]I think I moved way too far.
[159:21.42]I give up.
[159:21.84]I'm done.
[159:34.03]Do spray paint instead.
[159:55.26]Cheating.
[159:57.40]Alright.
[159:58.04]Let's play multiverses.
[159:59.90]I will come back to this.
[160:00.70]We will do this.
[160:04.03]Uh, we'll do this on the next stream.
[160:05.95]Maybe we'll do this, I like this double, the double feature shit.
[160:09.55]Keeps things interesting.
[160:11.53]We'll do this in another game.
[160:12.59]We'll play this for like a couple hours, two or three hours, play something else for two or three hours.
[160:15.48]I like, I actually enjoy doing that.
[160:22.66]So we'll come back to this on the next stream.
[160:26.74]Alright, so now I'm actually very excited to do what I'm about to do.
[160:31.45]Because Gizmo is in the game.
[160:41.96]Yeah, this is sponsored stream.
[160:45.54]But it's awesome, though, and I'll tell you why.
[160:47.10]I genuinely enjoy this game.
[160:50.40]And Warner Brothers has essentially reached out a few times and been like, hey, do you want to get sponsored again?
[160:55.95]I'm just like, yeah, that's fucking cool.
[161:00.99]I play this game off screen.
[161:03.15]I genuinely enjoy this game.
[161:07.34]Yeah, let me just set it up.
[161:08.90]We'll be right back.
[161:10.60]Give me like two seconds.
[161:12.50]And we'll come right back.
