[05:13.24]We're ready to go.
[05:14.26]We're fucking ready to go.

[05:19.05]Can we get a fucking round of applause for Sony Online Entertainment, please?
[05:24.61]Can we get a fucking straight up endorsement for PlayStation and Sony right now in the chat?

[05:42.15]Unbelievable.
[05:46.95]What a fucking, what a superior platform.
[05:52.15]I'm ready to go.
[05:58.44]The question is, are you guys ready?
[06:04.56]Scanning for installed downloadable content.
[06:06.34]I don't have any.
[06:08.52]We're just going straight up single player.
[06:10.65]Let's go.
[06:11.53]Welcome.
[06:11.93]I'm going to tweet now and say that I'm fucking Red Dead Redemption.
[06:13.87]And they have Undead Nightmare too.
[06:15.91]You know what I didn't get?
[06:19.71]You know what I didn't get, guys?
[06:27.24]Do you own this game?
[06:30.16]We have to contact Phil Spencer's personal cell phone to make sure you own the game that you just bought on Amazon.
[06:38.10]Are you sure?
[06:39.32]Put the disc in.
[06:40.12]Do you have the disc?
[06:41.60]Backwards compatibility is a big deal for us over in Microsoft.
[06:45.94]Get the fuck out of here.
[06:52.82]I can't believe it took this long.
[06:57.63]And look, and you guys know, you guys know for a fact, you guys all know, I'm not one of those people like, oh, PC, fucking console, like, I don't care.
[07:07.35]But when I'm proven, when I'm shown a product that fucking works when it says it's gonna work, when I press the fucking button, after purchasing it, and going through hoops, the update to Xbox One was like an hour and 45 minutes.
[07:22.45]Didn't happen with fucking PlayStation.
[07:24.65]Didn't happen with the Red Dead Redemption on PlayStation, now did it?
[07:28.52]It did not.
[07:32.12]It worked fucking immediately.
[07:38.29]Immediately.
[07:41.57]I don't want to fucking choose sides, but I'm gonna choose a side here.
[07:45.33]You got like, as if call Phil Spencer, he's crying.
[07:48.70]Versus immediate fucking product works when you press button, when you, as a consumer, works.
[07:56.90]Unbelievable.
[07:58.79]Well, it works.
[08:00.67]Here we go.
[08:01.87]For free, by the way.
[08:02.61]Fucking free.
[08:03.93]Didn't have to pay any fucking money.
[08:05.07]This was free.
[08:09.38]What a joke.
[08:18.64]Call Phil Spencer.
[08:19.69]He's crying.
[08:20.85]And look, it just works.
[08:22.11]It just fucking works.
[08:22.95]And I'm like streaming this game.
[08:24.61]I'm streaming the game and streaming this game to my house.
[08:29.95]And look at this!
[08:30.61]Fucking 780p quality!
[08:32.69]Alright everybody, quiet.
[08:35.29]I wanna hear this.
[08:36.03]I've never played this game.
[08:39.47]Fuck yeah Sony!
[08:40.88]Fucking coming through in the clutch!
[08:42.62]I want this posted on like all the Sony reddits, like Sony fucking coming through in the clutch!
[08:48.56]Fuck yeah!
[08:59.66]Fuck yeah!
[09:00.64]Okay, that's me in the middle.
[09:03.44]I'm Jack Sparrow.
[09:06.94]I'm fucking Captain Jack Sparrow.
[09:10.76]Rockstar Games presents...
[09:29.10]Captain Jack Sparrow.
[09:40.40]Rockstar San Diego production.
[09:49.12]I'm so happy this worked.
[09:50.37]This took so long and it was so much pain for Sony Online Entertainment to knock it out of the fucking park.
[10:00.73]Oh, stream title, okay.
[10:08.89]Stream title's fixed.
[10:16.55]There's a problem editing my status.
[10:21.62]I can't edit my status.
[10:23.66]Fuck yeah, so many stream titles.
[10:30.11]It is a wild game, you're right.
[10:33.61]Well, I for one am grateful, Mrs. Bush, that they are finally bringing civilization to this savage land.
[10:41.53]I could not agree with you more, my dear.
[10:44.33]My daddy settled this land, and I know he'll be looking down on us, pleased at how we helped the natives.
[10:51.12]Yes, they've lost their land, but they've gained access to heaven.
[11:00.98]Is that better?
[11:01.42]Are we in a good audible level here?
[11:03.70]Yeah, Sony.
[11:04.28]Like, I'm so happy right now.
[11:06.04]I'm so angry.
[11:29.18]I get to play the game I wanted to play.
[11:32.62]And all it took was pressing one button to play it.
[11:35.14]Are you sure you don't own this game, sir?
[11:40.42]It's me, Phil Spencer, calling to see if you own the game.
[11:45.79]Did you connect your Edge account yet, honey?
[11:50.01]I hardly think so, Jenny.
[11:54.06]Did you connect to your Microsoft Edge account yet, honey?
[11:57.40]Apparently, Mr. Johns wants to run for governor.
[12:02.05]Just making sure you did.
[12:03.55]Oh, by the way, our UI is lag-filled in time.
[12:07.37]I'm just, like, throwing mud.
[12:08.55]Okay, shut up.
[12:09.71]Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[12:10.21]Fuck yes, honey.
[12:15.17]I don't want to be judgmental, but this state should not be ruled by such a disgusting family.
[12:22.44]A family with no class.
[12:23.98]A family with no class.
[12:25.04]A family with no class.
[12:25.86]A family with no class.
[12:27.44]A family with no class.
[12:43.04]Let, let me, let me, let me go through here and just say, thank you anyway for sticking it out.
[12:50.03]I'm actually very, very surprised there are 25 plus hundred people here.
[12:54.63]I'm so sorry I took this long.
[12:56.13]I'm so sorry.
[12:56.89]I hope you at least thought it was funny.
[12:59.58]My fucking anger.
[13:00.58]I don't know.
[13:01.00]I'm sorry.
[13:01.88]I have nothing else to say.
[13:03.40]I'm so fucking sorry.
[13:05.32]It's like 10 o'clock and we're just starting.
[13:09.92]Dr. Screwball Jones, thank you for the hundred bucks.
[13:13.53]Best Sony ad I've ever seen.
[13:16.19]Well... Thank you.
[13:18.80]That's incredibly fucking generous of you.
[13:21.10]Thank you so much, dude.
[13:22.50]Sony all the way.
[13:23.67]I mean, they often seem to be the same thing.
[13:26.03]Cynical Breakdown, Comedy Corn.
[13:27.51]Thank you for the bits.
[13:29.21]Megalomoniacal Helene.
[13:30.27]Thanks for the five bucks.
[13:31.09]It's okay, Jerma.
[13:31.73]We still love you.
[13:32.45]Well, thank you.
[13:34.52]Gummy Monk.
[13:36.82]Thank you for the 1,500 bits.
[13:37.58]Thank you for the $15.
[13:39.34]This is gold.
[13:40.88]Oh, well, thanks.
[13:41.40]I appreciate it.
[13:42.74]If I missed anybody else, I'm sorry.
[13:44.00]I've not been paying that much attention.
[13:45.99]I'm obviously right.
[13:48.23]What is that noise?
[13:50.47]Oh, it's rain.
[13:51.81]That's rain.
[13:52.53]Okay.
[13:53.67]Alright, go to the saloon.
[13:55.75]Use L to walk around, R to look around.
[13:58.28]Let me get the chat back here.
[14:01.40]I'm like starting to stream now.
[14:04.72]And I have to piss?
[14:06.58]I didn't even pee yet.
[14:08.74]Ay-yi-yi.
[14:09.37]Look at this situated...
[14:15.10]Let me just go to the bathroom.
[14:17.96]We'll start in a minute here.
[14:19.12]Let me just pee.
[14:20.82]I will be there in two seconds.
[14:23.03]One second.
[14:23.63]I gotta pee.
[17:55.43]Okay.
[17:56.35]We're here.
[17:57.47]Sorry, the long P. Sometimes you have to take a long P. Not a big deal.
[18:02.43]Alright, so where do I go?
[18:05.03]How do I start the video game?
[18:06.73]I don't understand.
[18:08.37]It's been so long.
[18:09.13]This has taken so long that I don't know what to do.
[18:11.38]Where am I supposed to go?
[18:14.98]Loud P. It wasn't that loud.
[18:16.26]It was fairly loud, but it wasn't terribly loud.
[18:20.80]I just turned the game volume down?
[18:22.12]Is it that loud?
[18:23.54]Subtitles.
[18:24.00]Good idea.
[18:24.62]That's a good call.
[18:26.80]How do I turn on subtitles?
[18:31.74]I don't want to take a screenshot.
[18:34.56]I can't press start.
[18:36.82]There we go.
[18:38.26]Let's go to options.
[18:41.14]Let's go to audio.
[18:43.96]Headphones are off.
[18:44.74]Display.
[18:46.55]Subtitles.
[18:47.01]There they are.
[18:47.35]There you go.
[18:49.45]There are your subtitles.
[18:54.61]And we're back.
[18:56.77]Okay, so I need to go... I guess just to the marker, right?
[19:02.08]I'm so glad I actually get to play this, though.
[19:03.82]Like, this was such a pain in the ass.
[19:08.64]Shoot somebody?
[19:09.22]What do you mean?
[19:11.06]Why did you just tell me to shoot somebody?
[19:14.29]I look at chat and I say, shoot somebody.
[19:16.05]So I shot somebody.
[19:17.93]And I broke the law.
[19:21.06]Okay, I didn't know that's how that worked.
[19:23.98]It's not like GTA where you do... I thought, how am I supposed to... I thought I can't get in trouble.
[19:28.08]This is like the Wild West.
[19:32.82]We're going to see this screen a lot.
[19:37.81]Why did I listen?
[19:38.57]I don't know.
[19:38.91]I've never played this game.
[19:40.11]I'm a huge Rockstar fan, but weirdly enough, I've never played it.
[19:45.27]Oh, I'm in a story mission.
[19:46.11]Okay, I get you.
[19:46.99]I feel you.
[19:47.63]Okay.
[19:54.34]to run.
[19:54.74]Okay, hold X to run.
[19:56.64]That indicates where I need to go.
[19:57.76]Alright, cool.
[20:00.58]This is the tutorial.
[20:01.48]Look, I mean, look, I'm getting a lot of shit here.
[20:04.74]Look, I'm getting... Hold on a minute.
[20:06.21]Let me just pause this for a second.
[20:07.25]I'm getting a lot of shit and honestly, like, like, okay, let's like be real.
[20:13.57]If you have this much of an issue with my stream,
[20:17.18]Then just go fucking watch somebody else.
[20:19.28]Like, I'm seeing it, like, oh, like, what a terrible start to the stream.
[20:22.24]Then fuck it, I don't know, go watch, like, Vinny.
[20:24.22]Who fucking, whatever, whatever his name is.
[20:26.50]Does that guy fucking know?
[20:27.42]I can hear you.
[20:29.93]What?
[20:31.63]I can hear you, you know.
[20:32.95]Who can hear me?
[20:34.15]What's going on here?
[20:34.77]What are you talking about?
[20:35.47]Who can hear me?
[20:35.91]Is somebody here?
[20:42.81]I think that was, like, an ad that just played.
[20:44.37]That was weird.
[20:47.39]I'm your conscience.
[20:52.41]I got like an ad playing.
[20:54.98]Whatever.
[20:55.78]I got like an ad that's like playing.
[20:57.60]Whatever.
[20:59.02]Sure.
[20:59.68]Tell yourself that.
[21:03.42]Do you guys hear that?
[21:03.96]Do you guys hear that person talking?
[21:08.06]Am I like out of my mind?
[21:08.92]There's a cutscene going on.
[21:10.92]Let's just pay attention to this cutscene.
[21:13.66]I'm having trouble, though.
[21:15.40]Like, is that... Hold on.
[21:16.66]Hello?
[21:17.00]Who the fuck is this?
[21:18.72]Who is this?
[21:19.18]Who's talking right now?
[21:20.71]Is somebody talking right now?
[21:24.83]Like, I thought this was an ad playing.
[21:26.19]A...
[21:40.97]Wait a minute.
[21:41.45]Wait a second.
[21:42.05]Wait just a minute.
[21:42.71]Hold on a minute.
[21:43.21]Let me fucking go into my fucking mainframe and see what's going on here.
[21:48.38]You've got a virus.
[21:49.88]And the virus is called bad streaming.
[21:51.98]Oh my god.
[21:53.04]I don't know how we got in here.
[21:54.22]Somehow he fucking got in.
[21:55.38]Somehow he got into my fucking mainframe.
[21:56.96]And this is not cool.
[21:59.16]I can't fucking have this right now.
[22:00.42]I just had like the massive meltdown on stream and now I'm getting like invaded.
[22:03.55]Let me just try to get him out of here with my fucking x245 like by the 7th degree.
[22:11.82]Yep, you're gonna have to divide by zero to get rid of me, buddy.
[22:15.50]Who is this?
[22:18.30]You don't recognize my voice?
[22:20.16]This is, this is not, this is... Actually, I kind of do for a second there.
[22:24.69]Hey, what's up?
[22:25.77]What's up, Vinny?
[22:27.67]Is this Vinny?
[22:28.49]Is this Vinny?
[22:28.99]Is this mine sauce?
[22:30.83]It might be.
[22:31.55]It might be.
[22:31.97]I'm the voice you hear in your head.
[22:33.09]Get the fuck out of here!
[22:33.97]How dare you come into my stream and humiliate me in front of my 60,000 fucking viewers.
[22:40.17]I'm currently in the process of having an issue on my stream and then I get told that I'm not having a good stream.
[22:45.84]I'm having a good stream, goddammit.
[22:47.56]Get out of here for crying out loud.
[22:49.40]How dare you say something like this to me.
[22:52.26]You should have muted yourself when you went to go pee, man.
[22:55.32]Really unprofessional.
[22:56.20]I just fucking...
[22:59.43]He's just got such a fucking good stream, and, like, his stream is so good, and, like, my stream is, like, fucking so bad tonight, and I'm getting, like, a connection issue in the corner.
[23:10.14]It's just, like, we should watch MindSauce.
[23:11.89]They're, like, fucking talented people, and, like, where's my talent?
[23:16.33]Hang on a minute.
[23:17.01]Hang on a minute.
[23:18.51]Jerma, you've got talent.
[23:20.21]You just chose Xbox.
[23:21.83]That was the problem.
[23:23.27]Yeah, you know, you're right.
[23:24.43]You're right.
[23:25.21]Yeah.
[23:25.81]You're fine.
[23:26.43]You're good.
[23:26.89]Listen, people come into my chat all the time and they tell me, listen, Vinny, you suck.
[23:31.86]Where's Jerma?
[23:32.56]Jerma's better.
[23:33.34]Jerma, you know, Jerma's a better streamer and he doesn't like you.
[23:37.24]And then I found out.
[23:38.98]I found out something.
[23:39.90]That's not true.
[23:42.03]You do like me.
[23:43.11]I do!
[23:43.79]You don't really know who I am, but you like me.
[23:46.09]I don't!
[23:46.35]But I do!
[23:47.09]Of course I do!
[23:48.01]I've been a fan of the... What's it?
[23:50.61]VeenSauce?
[23:51.67]How do you pronounce it?
[23:53.59]Yeah, something like that.
[23:54.43]Vinnisauce.
[23:54.93]Vinnisauce.
[23:55.41]Vinnisauce.
[23:55.81]Okay.
[23:56.29]I've been a fan of you guys for years.
[23:57.55]Of course I have.
[23:59.07]And I, um... Of course.
[24:02.31]I'm glad you hacked into my computer, if I'm honest.
[24:05.87]Well, I had to, because people wouldn't shut the fuck up about you for quite a while, so I figured I really had no choice.
[24:11.83]Yeah, that's true.
[24:14.62]And this did come to a head.
[24:16.14]I did call you a bunch of names.
[24:18.21]Did I?
[24:18.55]No, I didn't.
[24:20.13]did he call me no did you call me names no I'm pretty sure I pretty sure just people put words in our mouth I think what they did was edited clips together to sound like like you're an asshole something like that right I mean they're they're they do that sometimes they do do that sometimes so uh well you know I'm glad we could squash this I'm glad I heard that you do like my stream though right it's like I do I'm glad I do and I love your story yeah
[24:46.85]Well, you know what?
[24:47.53]You're doing a great job.
[24:48.39]This is one of my favorite games.
[24:50.61]And I had I played it on Xbox, the Undead Redemption, as I call it, Undead Nightmare.
[24:56.22]And I had also to suffer through updates forever.
[24:58.72]So, yeah, I can feel your pain, man.
[25:01.22]I wish you luck.
[25:02.08]And this is a great game.
[25:03.58]Well, thank you.
[25:04.80]You know, at some point, maybe I should come and say hello on your stream, too.
[25:07.44]Maybe I should hack into your stream.
[25:08.72]Is there any streams I should hack into?
[25:10.24]Like, is someone coming up here?
[25:11.99]Yeah, you can.
[25:13.27]We have a charity stream coming up.
[25:14.83]We're going to be raising money for PCRF, so if you want to show up on stream on the Vsauce channel.
[25:20.83]Hey, Vsauce, Michael here.
[25:22.79]Then we can make that happen, maybe.
[25:25.20]When's that going to be?
[25:27.88]That's going to be, like, July 22nd.
[25:29.42]July 22nd?
[25:30.54]Something like that?
[25:33.18]Yeah, 21st to the 23rd of July.
[25:35.31]So maybe you, uh... I should put my ear to the ground.
[25:38.17]If I was a person that, like, wanted to care about, like, charity and shit, like, in all these great organizations, I'd just keep my ear to the ground July 22nd, something like that.
[25:45.77]Maybe you can hack into my mainframe, but listen, just use Sony from now on, okay?
[25:50.75]Just stick with PlayStation.
[25:53.67]Seriously, this is a great game.
[25:55.17]I love it, and I think you're going to have a great time with it, so I'm really excited that you finally got it working.
[26:00.09]Good luck, man.
[26:01.10]Thanks a lot, Vinny.
[26:02.32]That was Vinny from Vinesauce, everybody.
[26:04.26]He hacked into my computer.
[26:05.02]We don't hate each other.
[26:06.20]No, we don't.
[26:06.72]We don't hate each other.
[26:07.42]In fact, we find each other to be very, very interesting young, very young men, by the way, not like over the...
[26:12.82]Yeah.
[26:13.48]Well, I'm an advertisement.
[26:14.90]I am an advertisement, though, so I'm going to stop now.
[26:16.88]I'm going to let you do your thing, okay?
[26:18.90]Advertisement?
[26:20.59]We only advertise on this stream.
[26:21.93]That's all we do.
[26:23.43]Okay, alright.
[26:24.05]As long as I'm in the right place, then.
[26:25.55]Hamburger brands, hot dog brands, bun brands, that's what we do here.
[26:29.73]That's all we do.
[26:30.29]Alright.
[26:31.79]Well, I'm going to go ahead and let myself and you be a sellout, and I'm going to fuck off gracefully.
[26:36.37]You have a good night.
[26:38.05]See you later, buddy.
[26:38.69]Thanks.
[26:39.63]Bye, Jerma.
[26:41.72]How is that for a fucking $200 joke?
[26:44.84]How is that for a fucking $10,000 joke?
[26:47.60]Vinny.
[26:48.52]Vinny shows up and fucking... We'll just play the game.
[26:51.83]Let me just... Hold on.
[26:52.63]Give me a second.
[26:54.77]Didn't fucking see that one coming, did you?
[26:57.21]Fucking told you.
[26:57.85]Didn't see that shit coming.
[27:07.18]No, Vinny's a good dude.
[27:08.28]Vinny's a good dude.
[27:12.55]He's a very, very fun guy.
[27:16.35]Why am I on a horse?
[27:17.97]What do I need to do?
[27:18.53]I didn't pay that much attention.
[27:21.92]Yes, please check out the Vine slash charity stream.
[27:25.88]Coming up here soon.
[27:28.44]This joke took three.
[27:29.88]By the way, the reason why my stream was so shitty for the first two hours was because we were setting that up.
[27:36.32]What do I need to do?
[27:37.06]I didn't pay any attention.
[27:42.61]Like, what was I supposed to do here?
[27:45.71]I'm like jumping.
[27:48.80]I'll get back on the horse.
[27:52.50]Sorry, I was not paying attention.
[27:53.56]Let's get on the horse and go this way.
[27:55.18]Return to Jake.
[27:55.78]You got it.
[28:03.49]Turn on notifications.
[28:04.83]How do I sprint on the horse?
[28:11.59]How do you sprint on the horse?
[28:15.66]Use the mini-map.
[28:16.56]I'm just slowly making it over to you.
[28:19.06]Oh, fuck.
[28:20.34]How do you sprint?
[28:21.48]There it is.
[28:22.16]Let's jump.
[28:24.18]I'm pressing... Okay, it's TapX.
[28:26.27]I got it.
[28:26.55]Okay, let's go.
[28:27.41]I want to slow and stop.
[28:29.51]Got it.
[28:29.71]Left mouse button.
[28:39.80]When you're riding too close to a companion, you can hold X to match their speed.
[28:44.25]Okay.
[28:45.13]And here we go.
[28:45.59]We're starting Red Dead Redemption.
[28:47.07]Tap X to get a short gallop of speed.
[28:50.21]Okay.
[28:50.57]Force has... Okay.
[28:51.79]So it's just like a car.
[28:52.99]Match the guy's speed.
[28:53.87]We got...
[29:10.46]Just in time for the game.
[29:11.60]Yes, you are just in time for the game.
[29:12.90]Two crowns.
[29:13.22]Now we can enjoy the game.
[29:15.08]Yes.
[29:15.32]Although, I mean, it does kind of look like I'm playing this game for a cell phone.
[29:18.96]Fucking Sony, fuck yeah.
[29:38.61]Oh shit!
[29:38.87]Now I know what you're talking about.
[29:40.55]I don't know why this is off.
[29:42.85]Alright, we got it.
[29:43.69]We're good.
[29:44.18]Does it look okay?
[29:45.24]Does it look good?
[29:58.53]It might look a little rough here and there, because we are streaming the game from PS Now.
[30:22.37]It looks better than a weird error on Xbox One.
[30:24.63]I'm just, like, following this dude around, that's fine.
[30:27.04]The Undead Nightmare DLC is broken.
[30:28.66]Oh, whatever.
[30:54.10]Let me see if I missed anything.
[30:55.38]So I won't bother you none with my chatter.
[30:58.99]Um, here.
[31:03.45]I'll tell you, Mr. Marston, those coyotes eat better than I do.
[31:06.25]Sir Feline, thanks for the five bucks.
[31:07.97]And Can James thanks also for the five bucks.
[31:09.89]Good joke, I appreciate it.
[31:11.57]Scripted Sony stream.
[31:15.35]Scripted cell phone stream.
[31:17.99]Make sure you, like, up your quality, guys.
[31:22.51]Listen, mister.
[31:23.97]This here is what's left of Fort Mercer.
[31:26.78]Some gang rode in and took the place over.
[31:30.18]So I understand.
[31:31.20]Cool.
[31:32.90]This is where we part ways, friend.
[31:35.53]You have yourself a good time.
[31:37.95]Source.
[31:49.66]Uh, so, we're going... Approach Fort Mercer.
[31:53.63]Okay.
[31:56.99]This really does, like, gotta look like fucking... Like, this is like 480 feet.
[32:02.47]Alright, here we are.
[32:11.95]Looks like an NDS game.
[32:16.49]Looks like Nintendo DS.
[32:21.43]Well, at least we tried.
[32:22.94]At least it worked.
[32:26.04]Bill, I've come for you.
[32:27.28]Oh, why the fuck are you not modded, Vinny?

[33:19.47]I'm so sorry.
[33:20.49]We might have to go to Peggle, too, in a minute here.
[33:25.37]Bill, I implore you, think about this.
[33:28.15]He's even telling me there's an issue.
[33:29.25]It's like, ah, you can't do this.
[33:31.19]You implore me?
[33:34.78]You implore me.
[33:38.44]You always were one for fancy words.

[34:18.30]Alright, I'm just dead.
[34:27.47]I implore you, fix the bitrate.
[34:29.51]The internet connection quality is not sufficient for PS Now.
[34:31.85]The game will close in 15 seconds.
[34:37.67]No, wait.
[34:38.77]Wait, don't I have a say in this?
[34:40.77]I don't have a say in this.
[34:55.99]What are you talking about?
[34:57.09]Oh, God.
[34:58.67]Oh, God damn it.
[35:21.21]Well, back to Microsoft.
[35:22.59]No.
[35:25.02]Oh my god.
[35:27.10]Sony betrayed us.
[35:31.39]Well.
[35:36.91]Let's see if I can get back in.
[35:41.26]At least I got to play the... I got to open the game.
[35:43.94]That's true.
[35:46.78]Don't even say Microsoft in this chat.
[35:48.62]Don't do it.
[35:53.64]Should I just go plug in the VR?
[35:55.14]Oh, fuck, that's gonna take, like, that's gonna, I'm gonna lose people.
[36:00.14]This has been such a fucking shit show, trying to get this goddamn game to work.
[36:06.27]Go back to Microsoft.
[36:08.67]I can't.
[36:10.75]I fucking can't.
[36:16.75]It's gonna be alright.
[36:19.16]I was gonna go tell my neighbors to stop streaming fucking Parks and Recreation.
[36:23.04]I'll be fine.
[36:37.19]Let's address the elephant in the room.
[36:39.23]How about that?
[36:40.77]Rockstar.
[36:42.59]Why did you not port this to PC?
[36:45.48]Why is this just not on PC?
[36:50.09]And I didn't save.
[37:01.92]Minecraft is owned by Microsoft.
[37:03.64]That's true.
[37:06.86]We're getting into the real questions.
[37:11.22]Do I have to do all that again?
[37:16.58]It was in the middle of saving?
[37:17.70]Is it going to corrupt my game?
[37:20.77]We're about to go play Job Simulator right now in VR.
[37:23.35]I'm not even kidding.
[37:24.57]I got my fucking pajamas on.
[37:26.03]I don't even care.
[37:27.53]I'm literally about to plug it in.
[37:29.33]Like, cause like, what is even going on right now?
[37:33.99]Should I just play Job Simulator?
[37:36.91]Like the, like, I'm a streamer, I'm a YouTuber fucking game?

[37:52.60]It's gonna happen.
[37:54.54]But, I mean, like, I mean... I gotta fucking play Job Simulator right now.
[37:59.52]Like, that's... What am I supposed to do?
[38:03.94]I'm gonna fucking play, like, the game that all the streamers and YouTubers played for, like, fucking two weeks.
[38:12.51]Knack?
[38:12.97]I don't have Knack.
[38:17.85]Give me a second.
[38:18.97]I'll be right back.
[38:20.14]One second.
[38:20.88]Last BRB.
