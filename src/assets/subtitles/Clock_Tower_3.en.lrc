[00:01.52]How the heck are you?
[00:03.06]Hey.
[00:05.08]You sleeping?
[00:05.52]Hey, wake up.
[00:07.84]Hi guys.
[00:12.87]Oops.
[00:15.43]Welcome to another stream.
[00:17.85]Just saw you last night, potentially.
[00:20.55]Or maybe I didn't.
[00:22.23]Maybe you weren't here yesterday.
[00:25.48]And in that regard, how are you today?
[00:31.75]Loud streamer wakes up innocent viewers.
[00:37.49]Innocent viewers.
[00:38.47]What about that one time you called me an idiot?
[00:42.12]Guilty!
[00:44.22]Now, hope you guys are doing well.
[00:47.42]We're going to start today, sort of where we left off yesterday, and that is... I almost puked.
[00:57.23]What is going on?
[00:59.91]What's with this fucking, like, earthquake?
[01:06.13]Like, the chopper's closing in?
[01:12.20]Listen to this.
[01:18.62]You good?
[01:22.57]Okay, what is... Is everyone just hovering here?
[01:25.63]That was a long time.
[01:31.04]That was almost a full 10 to 15 seconds straight.
[01:34.36]Longer than that.
[01:35.96]But no, we're going to play Clock Tower 3.
[01:38.41]It is a classic PlayStation 2 game.
[01:41.39]I don't know how much of it I'm going to play, but I'm going to give it at least a solid attempt.
[01:48.76]And then from there we're going to move on to probably 25 to life.
[01:56.10]I still need to find a place to play this game that requires 12 hours.
[02:00.76]Maybe we'll do that today, too.
[02:05.26]Should I start?
[02:05.96]No, I can't start with that one.
[02:07.26]That game probably sucks ass.
[02:08.84]I thought Clocktower 3 was the bad one.
[02:16.85]Oh.
[02:18.85]I thought it was the good one.
[02:20.69]Did I get the bad one?
[02:26.55]Is Clock Tower 3 the bad one?
[02:32.61]3 is the bad one!
[02:33.91]So what's the good one?
[02:41.87]2 is the bad one.
[02:43.11]Clock Tower 3 is the good one.
[02:47.49]He doesn't know.
[02:48.27]1 and 2... 3 is just weird.
[02:53.95]It's not scary.
[02:56.20]Well, good thing I've got a little bit of a list here to play today and tomorrow.
[03:03.90]And then we're gonna take a- we're gonna close the book on retro for a while.
[03:07.93]I've said that, like, so many times.
[03:09.73]I have so many old games.
[03:12.27]I keep saying, yeah, we've done, like, three streams in a row of Dora Dreamcast.
[03:19.98]Yeah, we're gonna, like, close the book a little while on, like, the old retro stuff, and then, like, a week and a half later, I'm playing PlayStation 2 again.
[03:30.87]I was gonna say Dark Souls, but I don't know why that was gonna happen.
[03:36.26]It's not just the game that's old.
[03:41.68]But I love it, though.
[03:42.36]I love, like, playing these old games.
[03:43.92]Especially the old, strange, obscure ones that just don't make any sense.
[03:49.30]It scratches an itch in my brain.
[03:52.65]So, I love it.
[03:56.07]But we're gonna go back to VR.
[03:58.08]After tomorrow.
[03:59.45]So if you're wondering, wait, when are you going to go back to that VR stuff?
[04:01.67]I just needed a break from it.
[04:04.53]VR is going to come back next week.
[04:06.35]We're going to do Mind Show.
[04:09.57]And then I kind of want to go back to Jet Island.
[04:12.69]And keep playing that.
[04:17.65]But it should be fun.
[04:23.10]That should be at some point.
[04:24.12]At some point in the middle or late of next week.
[04:29.25]No one liked Jet Island?
[04:30.85]I did.
[04:35.05]I did.
[04:37.37]What's your overall opinion on VR so far?
[04:39.19]I wish I could just play it every day.
[04:42.25]We would be playing it.
[04:43.29]I'd be doing it right now.
[04:45.55]I'd be streaming VR today and yesterday.
[04:49.41]But I can't do it.
[04:51.59]My fucking old man brain can't do it.
[04:57.53]I just want to live in VR.
[04:58.65]Alright, let's get going.
[05:00.81]I'm gonna play the good one.
[05:08.04]Incoming Clock Tower 3.
[05:12.38]Let's just have some fun, you know?
[05:13.56]Let's just relax.
[05:16.16]You gotta build up a tolerance to it.
[05:17.52]Yeah, I just... If I do that for more than 3, 4, 5 straight days... 2 days in a row... 3 days in a row... If I wasn't even streaming it...
[05:27.17]I would still have to take a break from it for a couple days.
[05:29.15]I would start getting headaches.
[05:31.89]It's like wearing glasses for the first time.
[05:39.55]This game includes disturbing content and scenes of graphic violence.
[05:42.72]Does it?
[05:44.80]It's a PlayStation 2, though.
[05:45.92]It don't count.
[05:46.38]The graphics aren't good enough for it to be actually a problem.
[05:59.37]Produced by Capcom.
[06:01.89]Directed by... I didn't see it.
[06:07.60]Cutscene.
[06:08.00]Quiet.
[07:02.15]It is Mr. X. This is a Capcom game.
[07:13.42]Mr. X drops a nuke somewhere.
[07:39.86]I
[08:13.87]Clock Tower 3!
[08:14.63]Alright, make sure we look right here.
[08:22.75]Only type.
[08:24.17]I can't type and play the game at the same time.
[08:31.19]That doesn't make any sense.
[08:32.41]This is not Detective Stream 2, although I kind of wish it was sometime.
[08:37.35]That was so much fun.
[08:39.88]Let me get this in the right spot.
[08:41.18]This is not correct.
[08:42.30]Not really.
[08:43.12]Wow, it's loud.
[08:44.20]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[08:45.74]It's pre-recorded.
[08:47.02]You can type.
[08:47.62]This is not pre-recorded.
[08:49.14]I feel like I'm going to get Phantom of the Opera memed here.
[09:08.82]No, no, I need that back.
[09:10.85]Give me that back.
[09:12.85]So I can see what I'm doing.
[09:13.63]Alright, that looks good.
[09:17.25]Little bit of bars on the sides, but it's cinematic, okay?
[09:23.56]Well, get those bars off!
[09:24.68]No, that makes it a 16x8.
[09:25.98]No, it makes it a 15x9.
[09:27.10]You guys, that's cinematic.
[09:41.28]Is this a movie?
[09:44.31]I don't know.
[09:54.86]Dearest Alyssa, how have you been?
[09:56.78]I think of you every day.
[09:59.43]It seems such a long time since you started your life at boarding school.
[10:03.39]It was after your beloved grandfather went missing while traveling three years ago that I sent you away to boarding school and told you not to come back for at least six years without giving you any explanation.
[10:15.91]It must have been very painful for you, and I'm sorry, but it was for your own protection.
[10:21.35]Now, your 15th birthday is approaching, and I fear your life may be in danger more than ever before.
[10:27.49]Please go into hiding until your 15th birthday has passed.
[10:32.10]I know that what I am saying will make no sense to you, but please do as I tell you and hide as quickly as you can.
[10:39.30]Your loving mother, Nancy.
[10:42.82]Mom.
[10:44.45]Alyssa, you're wanted on the telephone.
[10:46.76]It's your mother.
[10:49.34]Hello?
[10:50.02]Mom?
[10:50.56]Hello?
[10:50.84]Are you there?
[10:51.84]What's wrong?
[10:53.90]Answer me.
[10:54.72]Hello?
[10:55.54]Hello?
[10:56.48]Mom?
[10:57.22]Hello?
[10:58.26]Mom?
[10:59.22]Mom?
[11:00.50]Answer me.
[11:03.24]Am I playing yet?
[11:16.41]Margins.
[11:25.69]What?
[11:25.89]Are we already starting?
[11:26.71]Alright, I should pay attention and not write like fucking tongue-in-cheek scripts on my video page.
[11:40.28]By the way, I think that was the actual GarageBand default sound you can make for a jumpscare.
[11:57.46]Does Mr. X talk?
[11:58.34]Does he have a tail?
[12:00.38]Daughter.
[12:13.26]That was early yesterday morning.
[12:15.48]Huh?
[12:16.44]She mentioned that she would not be coming back for some time.
[12:19.62]What?
[12:20.42]She was wrong.
[12:21.74]She won't be coming back at all.
[12:24.40]And he's going to bring the scissors out and start snapping at me.
[12:27.30]You are all alone in this world now, little girl.
[12:30.70]See?
[12:31.68]Here we go.
[12:34.30]My sweet Alyssa.
[12:36.08]I don't like this.
[12:36.90]I've been waiting so long for this moment.
[12:39.09]Get away from me.
[12:39.71]I don't like this version of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.
[12:43.95]Is that supposed to be, uh... Snood?
[12:47.55]What's his name?
[12:48.95]Olaf.
[12:58.36]Count Snood.
[12:59.14]Alright, let's go.
[13:01.82]So I just... What the fuck was that?
[13:05.53]My shadow.
[13:06.03]I thought the shadow was an alien.
[13:09.51]What am I supposed to do?
[13:10.17]The light from the fire casts a reddish glow.
[13:12.50]Okay.
[13:16.68]Play Snood, or pre-recorded.
[13:19.56]Snood is the original virus game, don't you guys know?
[13:22.88]The clock keeps perfect time.
[13:29.91]In the chair that strange gentleman was sitting in, a terrible smell is emanating.
[13:36.52]His unwashed, smelly body had been sitting there for at least three or four hours.
[13:45.95]And you find it absolutely revolting that a smell could linger for that long.
[13:49.61]Okay, so this was a save point.
[13:57.57]A diary lies open with an incomplete entry.
[13:59.54]You can save game data here.
[14:01.22]Sure.
[14:05.40]Bootleg smelly Mr. X. Just leave and call the police.
[14:22.63]Something wrong?
[14:25.43]Okay.
[14:26.15]One minute and 20 seconds.
[14:28.07]Guest wing first floor.
[14:29.21]Alright.
[14:31.79]Yeah, I'm just gonna leave.
[14:33.07]There's no need to go out now.
[14:34.23]I have to find Mom.
[14:35.27]Alright, let's go find Mom.
[14:38.90]This is bright.
[14:39.92]A strange pattern adorns the jar.
[14:41.76]It is brimming with fresh water.
[14:46.46]Okay.
[14:48.66]Uh, do I have any other menu?
[14:50.22]Okay, is there a menu or something I can look at?
[14:52.17]Here, this is a map.
[14:55.77]So it looks like I can go through.
[14:57.85]Okay, let's go there.
[15:00.81]Mr. X is just Sir Topham Hatt?
[15:03.65]What about this way?
[15:05.49]Nothing of interest here.
[15:07.39]You don't want to open the door?
[15:15.54]Do I hide in this game?
[15:16.88]I have to hide from Mr. X, right?
[15:19.74]It's filled with art and antiques.
[15:21.74]Grandfather used to collect that kind of thing.
[15:29.40]This is Capcom, so those of you saying this is a copy of Resident Evil, you mean you're probably right, but they made the other one too.
[15:38.41]All guest rooms from this point forward, everyone's out.
[15:42.55]It's locked.
[15:43.05]All guest rooms from this point forward, everyone's out.
[15:45.27]Okay.
[15:50.44]Grandfather's room.
[15:51.28]He's not here now.
[15:52.26]It's been three years since he left.
[15:53.78]When is he coming back?
[15:56.60]Ooh.
[15:56.86]Ooh.
[16:00.27]I don't know if he's gonna come back.
[16:02.76]I don't know how to tell you that.
[16:08.44]He left.
[16:08.96]He took off three years ago.
[16:12.28]No one decided to tell her.
[16:13.36]Alright, we're upstairs now.
[16:17.49]Let's check this one.
[16:18.11]Let me look at the map.
[16:22.79]I need to have complete map knowledge.
[16:24.59]Where am I standing?
[16:26.75]Right there.
[16:27.13]So we're gonna go in the corner here.
[16:28.51]Alright.
[16:34.39]This one has a spell on it.
[16:42.48]Okay, so it turns the lights off.
[16:45.41]That's a pretty weird place for a light switch.
[16:49.13]The panic meter.
[16:52.21]Whenever Alyssa is feeling physically or emotionally threatened, the panic meter rises.
[16:58.12]When the panic meter reaches max, Alyssa falls into a state of panic.
[17:02.22]While in a state of panic, Alyssa's movements are restricted, and if attacked while in a state of panic, she will die.
[17:09.43]The panic meter reading will go down slowly if Alyssa relaxes in a safe place.
[17:15.43]Always keep an eye on the panic meter and try to minimize stress whenever possible.
[17:21.15]Alright, so we have to manage a panic meter.
[17:26.01]Or you could call it the P meter.
[17:28.49]For short, we could simplify that as the Peter.
[17:35.72]Sounds good.
[17:37.14]So don't touch that.
[17:42.62]First jump scare of the game.
[17:46.72]Fire!
[17:54.81]That's really bad you found it, Jingle.
[18:00.03]Alright, let's see what it is.
[18:02.03]The wall behind the fireplace is falling apart.
[18:05.36]Who would have thought there was a hidden room in there?
[18:08.18]We'll get in there.
[18:13.20]Oh, well, circle is crouch, apparently.
[18:20.63]Do I get any weapons or anything?
[18:21.73]No.
[18:21.85]The whole point of Clock Tower is you're just walking... Okay.
[18:26.11]Grandpa had a weird... Graphic imagery.
[18:30.65]That's graphic.
[18:33.54]See?
[18:38.98]What's that?
[18:39.28]Let me see!
[18:43.06]That looks like a bottle and a letter down there.
[18:47.54]It's a bottle of... Sacred Bottle.
[18:51.87]And a letter.
[18:52.29]Let's read the letter in a good accent here.
[18:56.69]Nancy's letter.
[18:59.02]No, I'm not gonna do that again.
[19:01.06]Dearest Alyssa, I wanted nothing more than for you to live peacefully.
[19:06.94]But if you are reading this now, you must have come back to the house.
[19:12.01]For your protection, I am giving you some advice, as well as instructions on how to use this bottle of holy water.
[19:18.23]How to use it.
[19:19.55]If you ever are threatened, sprinkle some holy water on your assailant.
[19:23.20]It will cause them to hulk temporarily.
[19:25.88]And to break the suit- No, I'm not- I gotta- I have to fucking take this knowledge in, because I'm gonna re- People get mad when I play games like this, and I act like a dickhead, and I don't pay attention to what this says.
[19:37.83]Because right now I'm not paying any attention at all to what this says.
[19:40.83]I'm just reading it.
[19:41.81]Here we go.
[19:43.97]Exorcism.
[19:44.97]If you ever are threatened, sprinkle some holy water on your assailant.
[19:50.70]It will cause them to halt temporarily.
[19:55.88]Okay.
[19:57.56]So, splash holy water like that.
[20:00.22]Okay.
[20:00.56]Destroying sigils.
[20:02.82]To break the seals that prevent access to certain places, sprinkle holy water on them.
[20:09.40]So those seals, I sprinkle holy water.
[20:11.56]I'm paying attention.
[20:13.33]I'm paying attention.
[20:14.25]See?
[20:18.59]So sprinkle, sprinkle.
[20:22.03]Replenishing holy water.
[20:24.15]Always remember that the holy water you have is not in limitless supply.
[20:28.27]You can refill your bottle from either sacred jars or from lion drinking fountains.
[20:35.01]Sacred jars or lion drinking fountains.
[20:37.23]So the jars, the jar...
[20:40.26]Okay, my mouth, I've got to like... Yeah, so those jars, the ones that are glowing.
[20:47.33]Sentimental items and spirits.
[20:48.59]A person who has died of unnatural causes has unfinished business in the living world.
[20:53.31]In order to protect yourself, you must work to heal their wounds.
[20:56.63]To do so, you must find their sentimental item.
[21:02.13]Lastly, this is all my fault, but I will do my best to protect you.
[21:06.55]Please remember that I love you more than anything else in the world, and I always will.
[21:10.27]So we have to find sentimental items to let the spirits go free.
[21:16.38]Replenish the holy water from jars and drinking fountains.
[21:20.38]Sigils can be destroyed with the holy water sprinkle, and the bad guy that chases you in the game can be temporarily stopped with the sprinkle of the holy water.
[21:33.54]I'm reading.
[21:34.06]See?
[21:34.72]I'm trying.
[21:35.30]I'm turning over a new leaf in 2019.
[21:36.70]It's paying attention to tutorial messages and really focusing.
[21:43.16]I'm not going to do it in both accents.
[21:46.88]It's the patron saint of the Hamilton house.
[21:50.36]I can't even do it now.
[21:53.43]What is it doing in here, though?
[21:56.33]The fucking dumb shit comedy part of my brain is fighting me inside my head right now.
[22:01.07]There's a battle going on.
[22:06.31]I'm gonna save the game.
[22:06.91]Alright, so I got the bottle of holy water.
[22:08.69]Is it mapped already?
[22:10.13]How do I use it?
[22:11.36]Three?
[22:12.82]So I have three uses of it.
[22:14.22]How do I use it, though?
[22:21.24]Can I stand up?
[22:21.96]Circle?
[22:23.34]Let me go to the controls first.
[22:26.73]Items.
[22:28.93]Files.
[22:29.87]Key items.
[22:30.51]Options.
[22:30.87]Let's just look.
[22:33.39]This is back when games didn't have tutorials.
[22:35.61]The tutorial for games back like 20 years ago, they had instructional booklets that you read before you put the disk in.
[22:43.74]Alright, search is X, duck is circle, walk is square, attack is triangle.
[22:50.23]That's very important.
[22:51.45]No vibration, because it'll just ruin everything like it always does.
[22:55.61]Special arrow is R1.
[22:59.03]Well, it's triangle.
[23:04.42]You read the booklets on the way back from the game store.
[23:06.76]Yeah, don't you guys wish that it was like that still?
[23:10.33]They should have a timer when you download a video game.
[23:14.23]You open it up and there's a 30 minute timer.
[23:16.43]And it gives you a little book to read about how the game works.
[23:20.85]And the game doesn't physically unlock until 30 minutes after you open it.
[23:30.97]Alright, so I can open this now.
[23:33.71]With the holy water.
[23:36.24]So let's try it.
[23:36.82]Did it work?
[23:41.94]Yep.
[23:43.94]I need to save the game.
[23:45.28]Is there a save point gonna be in here?
[23:50.94]Let's just go save it.
[23:52.18]Because I know, this is one of those games where I have to save it constantly.
[23:58.93]There's going to be monsters, there's going to be aliens and shit.
[24:05.76]Save the game after all that hard work.
[24:10.68]The game looks cool.
[24:13.96]Yeah, I thought you guys said this was the bad one.
[24:16.82]I did my research.
[24:19.72]I did my research on which one was the best one.
[24:21.61]AKA, which one was the cheapest and currently available for me to buy.
[24:26.27]I did a lot of research on it.
[24:33.78]I have a question, though.
[24:35.18]If I refill this here, does it get rid of this?
[24:37.18]Should I not refill this until I have zero?
[24:42.00]He didn't read the manual for 30 minutes.
[24:49.36]The cheapest one.
[24:50.10]I'm just kidding.
[24:50.66]This wasn't the cheapest one.
[24:52.52]I did save.
[24:55.04]Refill the holy water.
[24:55.98]Yeah, I did just save it.
[24:57.60]Let's see if it disappears.
[24:59.54]No, okay, good.
[25:00.16]So I can refill it whenever I want there.
[25:04.24]who reads anymore.
[25:07.15]That's the problem with this generation is nobody's reading books anymore.
[25:10.25]You know what I'm saying?
[25:13.17]Like, that's a problem.
[25:14.37]People aren't reading anymore.
[25:23.86]You should be reading a book a week.
[25:28.14]It's actually, it's offensive to me that people are not reading at least one to two books a week.
[25:35.74]Can I get rid of this one?
[25:37.18]That's got a sigil on it.
[25:44.55]Name one book you've read this year.
[25:46.11]It's 2019!
[25:58.74]Look, this is what I do.
[26:01.08]So, yeah, we have to read one book per week, right?
[26:05.22]Is what I just said.
[26:07.14]That's fine.
[26:07.74]What I do is I wait till the end of the year, and then the last, like, six weeks of the year, I read a book every day.
[26:14.43]So it still counts.
[26:16.21]This is Nancy's room.
[26:25.96]Well, hold on.
[26:26.42]That's not... Wait a minute.
[26:27.08]I did read how to reinstall the filter in my air purifier.
[26:32.35]That was actually really long.
[26:33.71]It was probably like 15 pages of how to do maintenance and care on my humidifier.
[26:44.22]Is that me?
[26:44.84]Moment up.
[26:48.60]Archie comics don't count as a book.
[26:50.16]Yes, they do.
[26:52.80]I read all of the Attack on Titan manga.
[27:00.43]I'll prove it to you.
[27:01.35]You gotta read it right to left.
[27:03.93]Huh?
[27:04.77]I told you that I did that.
[27:06.19]Undeniable proof.
[27:14.90]Those pillows suck.
[27:31.74]Those are pillows you'd find as a throw pillow on a dirty couch.
[27:35.70]That's what you sleep on?
[27:36.64]Is that Mom?
[27:44.28]Did he replace himself in all the family photos?
[27:51.95]Who's playing the piano?
[27:54.41]Who's playing that?
[27:55.23]Where's the sound coming from?
[28:04.46]You should have stabbed the photo.
[28:06.00]You had an opportunity.
[28:06.76]This is the way to kill him.
[28:07.72]This is his heart right here.
[28:08.88]And you had a chance.
[28:09.42]And that's what we're going to find out at the very end of the game.
[28:11.42]You could have just stabbed the book.
[28:14.55]And blood will come out of that book and you kill him.
[28:28.86]They're gonna do more shit like that in movies.
[28:30.32]I'm so sick of, like, the doll that comes to life.
[28:33.44]I'm so sick of, like, that we got lost in the woods.
[28:36.41]No, no, no.
[28:36.85]Where's the book that is the heart, or that is the monster?
[28:41.37]And the book is just a spell book.
[28:43.58]It's like Merlin's fucking tomb, you know what I mean?
[28:47.22]And the family is so terrified of all this shit going on in the house.
[28:50.24]It could be werewolves.
[28:51.71]They could be fucking Loch Ness monsters.
[28:53.25]It could be aliens like crashing down in the house and like killing people and eating people.
[28:57.17]But it's the book that's doing it.
[28:58.41]It's the Merlin's fucking magic tomb that's on their bookshelf.
[29:01.33]And they didn't even realize it.
[29:02.09]And they flip through at the end of the movie.
[29:03.53]And it's every page is all the fucked up shit that's been going on in the house.
[29:07.78]And they fucking stab through the book.
[29:09.24]And like the book bleeds.
[29:10.40]And that's the end of the movie.
[29:16.52]The door is sealed.
[29:21.04]That's literally happened in Goosebumps.
[29:23.94]Well, make it!
[29:24.92]Okay, was that just a Goosebumps book?
[29:43.84]These mo-capped explosion jumps.
[29:50.51]Actor in a studio with, like, a bunch of wires off.
[30:01.48]Alright, this is... way too expensive for us to not know what the hell's happening.
[30:13.52]She's desperately trying to find the piano.
[30:16.68]And each key on the piano has a different monster on it, and like he's... I'm sorry, never mind.
[30:27.05]So where am I supposed to go?
[30:31.13]I thought this was Clock Tower 3.
[30:32.49]This dude's playing Flight of the Bumblebee.
[30:43.04]Something's holding the door closed.
[30:44.08]There's gonna be a monster in here.
[30:48.95]Elsa.
[31:01.70]Uh oh.
[31:09.43]Monster sequence, I'm ready.
[31:11.77]Oh shit.
[31:17.31]Oh shit.
[31:19.02]That was a great reaction.
[31:19.92]The ring.
[31:20.36]Give me back my ring.
[31:24.07]Ring?
[31:29.65]Here comes the piano.
[31:31.13]Can I get the ring?
[31:33.43]Ring.
[31:33.79]What about it?
[31:34.13]Is it in here?
[31:34.65]Okay.
[31:38.64]Engagement ring.
[31:40.76]I got a ring!
[31:45.06]Spiritual healing.
[31:48.05]When you find a sentimental item that belongs to a person who died of unnatural causes, return it to its rightful owner.
[31:54.35]If it is a ring, put it in its case.
[31:55.95]If it's a half-heart pendant, put it together with the other half.
[31:59.01]By returning the sentimental item, spirits are healed, and the listener may obtain another item or valuable information in return.
[32:05.03]When you find a sentimental item... Some people are getting probably very angry at this.
[32:13.56]Sorry, let me just like swirl around my fucking whiskey.
[32:20.45]When you find a sentimental item that belongs to a person who died of unnatural causes, return it to its rightful owner.
[32:27.73]If it's a ring, put it in its case.
[32:33.78]If it is a half-heart pendant, put it together with the other half.
[32:39.04]By returning these sentimental items, spirits are healed, and Alyssa may obtain another item or valuable information in return.
[32:47.46]Put the ring in the box.
[32:49.04]Put the pendant together.
[32:51.44]You got it.
[32:57.20]The box is literally right here.
[33:04.15]How do I put the ring in the box?
[33:05.65]I kind of have to get you a... Should I throw holy water at this lady?
[33:11.37]Put the ring in the box.
[33:14.52]An empty ring box.
[33:15.24]Did someone steal the ring from him?
[33:21.18]Do I actually have to select it?
[33:35.92]What's inventory?
[33:36.62]Does it start?
[33:38.89]Okay, do I actually have to use it?
[33:41.01]Drop it!
[33:41.67]Okay.
[33:44.87]Yeah, I know what you're gonna do.
[33:50.91]Use item, yes.
[33:55.29]My ring!
[33:56.33]You found my ring!
[33:58.47]Thank you.
[34:03.85]Here, I left you some humanity.
[34:07.24]Thanks, hacker.
[34:09.22]Sigil stone.
[34:16.66]Sigil stone.
[34:17.44]Let's get some info on that.
[34:21.06]Will take an attack on your behalf once.
[34:25.10]So it's just... It's just a shield.
[34:31.52]So it's an armor.
[34:32.74]It's one armor.
[34:35.26]Ooh, I can refill this.
[34:37.08]Good thing I paid attention.
[34:37.92]Uh, it's a green fawn.
[34:44.57]You can save and refill.
[34:45.69]That's cool.
[34:46.03]Save it.
[35:01.10]How the hell do you do that in a piano?
[35:05.61]How could you be that fast?
[35:08.23]Listen to this guy.
[35:15.48]How the fuck do you even do that shit?
[35:24.49]If you know how to play the piano well, seriously, that's... that's a skill.
[35:30.03]That's an incredible skill.
[35:44.68]Congress?
[35:45.10]What's that?
[35:45.74]I can hear a piano, is it coming from Congress?
[35:56.47]Jerma, do the invisible guitar joke.
[36:03.59]He starts and stops playing.
[36:05.57]It's almost like he forgets how to play the song and then he just goes completely wild and knows exactly, see?
[36:10.85]Wait, is it this key?
[36:13.09]Yeah, I know, I got it again.
[36:29.58]Stop playing this game to force another joke?
[36:34.15]Wait, you want me to, like, put another PlayStation game in?
[36:36.59]No, I want to play this game!
[36:41.07]What?
[36:50.38]You want me to, like, you want to put in, like, a... You want to put in, like, fucking Stuntman and reach for content?
[36:59.30]What's wrong with this?
[37:01.27]No, we're doing this for a little while.
[37:15.02]I'm playing this for a while.
[37:16.56]Alright, I gotta find a ring.
[37:34.38]You're constantly stopping to make jokes.
[37:36.60]Do you know what stream you're on?
[37:42.56]I'm pretty sure that's what we do every time we play a game.
[37:52.76]Alright, I got a pen.
[37:58.83]Is this this lady's pen?
[38:01.57]Looks like you shoved it up your ass.
[38:13.71]I thought this guy was a serious gamer.
[38:16.59]Alright, but that's not a, uh, just a gold fountain pen.
[38:21.02]Okay.
[38:28.42]It's covered in bloodstains of victims' belongings.
[38:31.10]Gendry begins, my darling must be addressed to her fiancé.
[38:36.60]Did you... pen come out of here?
[38:50.01]I returned the pen.
[38:51.75]That means I get one of those shards, right?
[38:53.31]Invisibility Band.
[38:55.77]Alright, this game's starting to get really, really bad.
[38:59.36]It's, like, not fun.
[39:00.84]And I should go force a joke on another game.
[39:03.84]Ring worn for temporary invisibility!
[39:11.06]No, I'm just kidding!
[39:11.92]I fucking think this is fun!
[39:16.51]Hey, you can just relax!
[39:17.69]What else is over here?
[39:28.91]Do another Scottish accent.
[39:35.39]No, what is with you guys lately?
[39:37.35]This is like the guy yesterday that said, You can't take a break for a day and then come back and play Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[39:48.64]How dare you take a day off and then play Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[40:00.06]He was right.
[40:06.04]Alright, I made it into a new house.
[40:17.22]Lavender water, what's the difference?
[40:25.62]Cordial distilled from beautiful purple flower alleviates panic, okay.
[40:31.98]Make some smell nice.
[40:36.23]There's gonna be something in here scary.
[40:43.11]Ooh.
[40:46.85]This is a letter from Dad!
[40:48.01]Here comes a joke!
[40:53.25]How are you?
[40:53.91]I'm now in France, in a region known as Champagne.
[40:56.65]Ooh.
[40:58.41]And it's a beautiful place, with vineyards as far as the eye can see.
[41:03.05]When the war is over, we must come here together for a holiday.
[41:07.08]I hear that they have organized for blackouts in London now.
[41:11.10]I'm sure that you are fine during the day, as Jane is there.
[41:16.30]But I worry about your being alone at night.
[41:19.52]You'll be alright, won't you, darling?
[41:22.42]Keep warm, with love, Orson.
[41:27.50]Did I miss something?
[41:40.24]Nah, that was a classic reference.
[41:41.61]Classic joke.
[41:44.13]That's a huge telephone.
[41:46.21]It's way too big for anybody to hold.
[41:47.73]Oh, that's just you, because you're short streamer!
[41:59.82]What's up here?
[42:06.37]Good evening, sir.
[42:07.17]This is my first stream.
[42:08.29]I want serious gameplay.
[42:12.83]I'm sorry that you probably won't get that here.
[42:24.36]Bring back Orson!
[42:25.48]Bring back Orson!
[42:26.70]Bring back Orson!
[42:32.04]The desk is clean and well organized.
[42:36.33]No, it just depends on who's got control of the controller today.
[42:39.21]You know what I mean?
[42:41.17]Some days, you get me.
[42:44.05]Other days, you get a guy that beats Jevil first try.
[42:47.19]I don't know who you're going to be talking to.
[42:49.96]Remember that movie with Professor X, the young Professor X?
[42:55.06]It's kind of like that.
[42:56.60]Whatever his name is.
[42:59.50]This must be the owner of the house.
[43:00.88]There's a key.
[43:08.61]There's a key next to it.
[43:09.65]Yes, there is.
[43:13.47]Red draw key.
[43:16.55]There's probably a red draw in this building.
[43:25.32]Fireplace.
[43:27.14]The poker is still stuck in the pile of firewood.
[43:29.28]Somebody must have just been here.
[43:34.90]These records look quite old.
[43:37.48]Oh!
[43:42.28]I wonder how many people screamed at that one.
[43:48.41]That wasn't even a goat.
[43:48.95]That was just a rat.
[43:50.69]There's a mouse in here.
[43:52.15]Or a snake.
[43:52.61]It could be a snake!
[43:54.79]More than enough books on the classics here.
[43:57.75]We've got Dermacraft.
[43:59.37]We've got Otto's Big Adventure.
[44:02.33]We've got Orson Welles.
[44:04.86]What were the classics in there?
[44:10.20]Uh, I want more water, though.
[44:16.75]Rat movie.
[44:18.47]I'm looking for a red drop.
[44:20.65]Is there one down here?
[44:27.69]No... No... Why am I so interested in this game?
[44:33.10]I just am.
[44:37.76]Locked from the other side.
[44:38.82]Shit.
[44:40.39]On the other side, the key's not going to work.
[44:49.62]Will it just use it automatically?
[44:51.56]No, it's for a draw.
[44:56.74]Have you ever played any good games?
[44:58.34]I played SUPERHOT VR like three days ago.
[45:00.00]It was great.
[45:02.96]Beat it on stream, too.
[45:08.39]That's a really slow inventory.
[45:11.74]Red draw.
[45:13.50]Did we go in here?
[45:24.19]He said good.
[45:26.31]Is that a red draw?
[45:27.37]The desk is clean.
[45:28.21]No, we were already in here.
[45:29.31]There's no red draw.
[45:31.63]Red draw.
[45:32.28]Okay, now you dropped it again.
[45:33.52]Like you were going to get me again somehow.
[45:37.60]Let me look at the map.
[45:40.62]Okay, I haven't been over here.
[45:44.67]What do you mean, what am I saying wrong?
[45:51.05]Unimaginative ghost puts jumpscare back in same place.
[45:59.71]That is pretty funny.
[46:02.11]This way, okay.
[46:05.79]Red drop.
[46:08.86]Blood.
[46:09.18]There's blood everywhere.
[46:10.98]It's locked, I'm gonna let it open.
[46:19.40]I only have one.
[46:20.08]There it is.
[46:25.41]Draw-er.
[46:27.93]Yeah, but... You gotta remember, I have the remnants of a Boston accent.
[46:35.97]I still say, like, car.
[46:37.66]Car.
[46:38.74]Car.
[46:40.28]Draw.
[46:40.94]Draw-er.
[46:43.80]What are you guys on about?
[46:44.60]Christmas tragedy.
[46:45.42]Young pianist brutally murdered.
[46:48.39]Christmas Day, Mae Norton was found murdered in Norton's The Tailor.
[46:54.90]She was discovered by Norton family member Jane Stride.
[47:00.02]who returned home to find the victim unconscious.
[47:02.88]An autopsy revealed that it was an instantaneous death caused by a blow to the skull with a heavy blunt object.
[47:08.38]No suspects have been named.
[47:10.41]The victim had taken part in the 15th Annual Piano Concours at the Victoria Hall in Kensington the previous day.
[47:18.61]A consummate pianist, Miss Norton, was widely tipped for first prize.
[47:23.81]Okay.
[47:23.93]It's pianist.
[47:46.02]Something going on upstairs.
[47:50.80]What the hell is going on up here?
[47:55.16]What?
[47:55.42]Where was this happening?
[47:58.92]Why did I miss this upstairs?
[48:03.24]What the fuck?
[48:14.82]Oh my fucking god.
[48:16.38]That's insanity.
[48:19.86]Are you serious?
[48:24.42]I don't even have a save point.
[48:25.38]What am I supposed to do?
[48:28.10]Evade points and hide points.
[48:33.61]When Alyssa is fleeing from an enemy, certain predetermined areas may start to glow.
[48:37.65]These are evade points and hide points.
[48:40.97]Approach the area and press the search button to make Alyssa take evasive action or repel her attacker.
[48:47.75]Most evade points can only be used once.
[48:53.74]Always keep an eye on the panic meter!
[49:13.81]There's evade points and hide points.
[49:15.94]And they glow, and you have to hit X on them.
[49:18.56]Well, let's go, whatever, hold on, first of all.
[49:21.00]Let's open this first.
[49:22.44]There's something in here.
[49:25.05]It is... Maze Room Key.
[49:27.61]Oh, man.
[49:38.47]What?
[49:39.45]I can't open this!
[49:40.53]Alissa!
[49:42.51]Does he know my name?
[49:43.75]Can I get some evade points?
[49:47.74]Oh!
[49:59.53]Too slow!
[50:00.63]It's happening too slow.
[50:01.43]Where does it go?
[50:02.75]I have maze key.
[50:03.69]I have maze room key.
[50:05.01]What are you doing?
[50:09.93]Oh, fuck.
[50:12.19]Hide?
[50:17.10]I can't get in there?
[50:18.88]How can I not get in there?
[50:19.80]It's a ghost.
[50:20.90]Maybe I can scare you now.
[50:24.60]Fire poker.
[50:25.24]Fire poker in the head.
[50:35.41]Sorry, ghost.
[50:36.03]There's something way scarier here.
[50:38.03]What do I do?
[50:38.39]I gotta get out of here now.
[50:40.01]How do I get out?
[50:43.77]Anything else I can do?
[50:44.40]He's gonna get up, right?
[50:45.60]These records look old.
[50:46.54]No, no, no, get out of the room!
[50:47.98]Can I do anything else?
[50:52.86]Go, go, go.
[50:53.50]Out, out, out.
[50:58.94]Smash his head with a hammer.
[50:59.94]That's what I would do.
[51:02.22]If that was me, I would smash that guy's head with a sludge hammer.
[51:06.47]Like a watermelon.
[51:09.68]And then I would just like, I would burn him.
[51:11.88]I would drag him into the fire.
[51:16.74]Wait, where's the... And I would sit there and watch and just make sure it was gone.
[51:24.45]Psycho?
[51:25.23]M?
[51:25.49]Oh, really?
[51:25.97]The guy chasing you with a sledgehammer that just killed like a little girl?
[51:28.99]Are you sure?
[51:30.79]I'm the psycho?
[51:34.89]The key to Mei's room on the second floor.
[51:36.71]I need to get up there.
[51:43.28]I can't just leave.
[51:45.22]There's a locked door on the second floor.
[51:51.18]I've seen every horror movie in the book.
[51:55.97]You- okay, that- uh, after that guy's burnt, you put his ashes in a box.
[52:00.81]And like, mail it to the fucking sor- like, North Pole or something.
[52:10.12]And then you pay a guy.
[52:11.22]You pay a guy like 25 grand to eat the ashes.
[52:18.91]And you want like a private YouTube link of the guy doing it.
[52:25.09]Just so you know.
[52:25.81]There's a diary.
[52:38.72]But then the guy that eats the ashes becomes the guy.
[52:40.94]Okay, this is nice.
[52:53.25]Uh, today I darned Daddy's socks and sewed a button on his shirt.
[52:56.69]He calls himself a tailor, but he can't even mend his own clothes.
[52:59.41]Please, Dad, I'm not your wife.
[53:00.61]A few more days until the conference and I still can't play perfectly, but what am I to do?
[53:06.68]I know, what?
[53:07.28]I thought this was a game where a guy in a tower chases you with scissors.
[53:10.28]That's the first game.
[53:19.27]Yeah, we played the first game for like 10 minutes.
[53:22.67]It's an invitation.
[53:23.45]Uh-oh.
[53:30.58]I told you we should have burnt him!
[53:32.76]I told you we should have smashed his head like an egg and burnt his body!
[53:39.90]What did I tell you?
[53:40.56]Hit him with a chair in the head.
[53:45.18]Oh my god.
[53:46.22]Um... What are you doing?
[54:01.12]Okay, this guy is really, really not that strong.
[54:05.81]Like, that was pretty big.
[54:07.03]Come on, man, really?
[54:21.33]It was bad.
[54:23.05]He did a really cool Star Wars block the bullet.
[54:25.65]He hit the chair with a sledgehammer.
[54:29.97]But then... That's like getting one of those in a game where you're doing really well, and you do something fucking awesome.
[54:35.75]Like, you headshot a guy from across the whole map in Apex Legends.
[54:42.05]Right?
[54:42.83]So you're playing Apex Legends, and you're across the map and you snipe some guy, and it's fucking, like, put it on the front page of every Reddit.
[54:49.81]And then, you, like, fall off the cliff and die.
[54:57.82]That's what happens.
[54:59.24]That's what that was.
[54:59.94]Alright, I need to get out of here.
[55:08.28]Can I go-
[55:11.13]Alright, that's not even a sledgehammer, that's a broom.
[55:14.73]This guy sucks.
[55:17.39]Haha, idiot!
[55:25.62]Use holy water on him?
[55:27.06]That's not a bad idea.
[55:30.08]No, it's just a guy!
[55:30.94]This is just a weird guy.
[55:39.75]Alright, I have the invitation to the piano hall.
[55:43.36]I need to save the game.
[55:50.04]Where's there a save point?
[55:50.95]Around here somewhere.
[55:51.61]Outside, maybe?
[55:53.61]Is there no save point in this house?
[56:11.21]What?
[56:15.53]He's serious.
[56:17.29]I need to get down there.
[56:20.58]Dude, this is... This reminds me of Apex Legends.
[56:24.32]When you shoot the guy from across the map.
[56:26.84]And then you squad up and you land somewhere.
[56:32.90]And then some guy comes out of nowhere and kills you.
[56:36.10]I actually don't want to die here.
[56:53.41]This guy sucks.
[56:56.39]He really isn't even scary.
[56:58.21]He just sucks.
[57:02.12]Where am I?
[57:04.76]What?
[57:13.08]He teleported.
[57:14.20]Why did he teleport away?
[57:16.24]Oh, here comes Zipiano again.
[57:20.03]I can refill, right?
[57:24.49]I can't refill my water here?
[57:27.17]Dynamite?
[57:29.43]Gemma, you're the one playing the piano.
[57:36.29]Are you kidding?
[57:37.89]Really?
[57:38.65]Lisa!
[57:52.88]You know when you're fucking having a fun time with your friends in Apex Legends, and somebody over the mic is just like talking shit and making funny voices?
[58:02.05]It's so funny.
[58:22.44]I'm gonna have to learn how to play the piano.
[58:23.70]Watch this.
[58:26.12]What's that?
[58:26.62]Ooh, a diary.
[58:27.60]Save the game.
[58:28.12]Yep.
[58:32.81]What am I doing?
[58:33.19]The next Apex Legends stream?
[58:36.02]Um, why not, man?
[58:52.98]Bunker S. Is this stream sponsored by Respawn Legends?
[58:59.39]Apex Entertainment.
[59:04.07]No.
[59:05.13]No, it looks fun.
[59:08.27]It does.
[59:11.49]Looks like a fun game.
[59:13.52]Could be.
[59:13.92]I need some more holy water.
[59:20.87]It stopped.
[59:22.89]Wait, is this it?
[59:23.51]I don't have any holy water here.
[59:28.66]Did she stop because I'm in the hall?
[59:30.22]The concert hall?
[59:40.28]Jesus.
[59:42.73]Do I have to play this piano?
[59:48.23]The mocap really is the best part of this whole thing.
[59:51.69]Just the over-actor in front of the screen.
[59:55.85]Ohmygodnoob just gave 10 community subs.
[59:57.65]Thank you, Ohmygodnoob.
[60:01.56]Is it us she's looking at?
[60:02.86]Oh.
[60:14.11]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[60:25.77]Oh, she's missing the- I get it, right?
[60:32.78]Well, maybe if you cleaned up the- You- I know why you can't play the piano because it's covered in fucking red liquid!
[60:43.26]Wipe it off!
[60:43.94]Get some Lysol wipes and wipe the damn thing!
[60:54.60]Okay, I couldn't move.
[60:55.68]Alyssa!
[61:00.42]Now what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[61:02.06]Do I have to play the piano?
[61:04.84]The piano is dripping with blood.
[61:07.04]No?
[61:09.76]God damn it!
[61:11.66]No, I'm too pan- I- I have- I can't control the game.
[61:18.80]I need a special key.
[61:20.84]Pfft.
[61:26.36]What are you doing?
[61:30.20]I can't move.
[61:31.26]I'm panicking.
[61:32.70]Look at this run.
[61:35.36]I look like a bird.
[61:36.96]This is what a bird does right before it panic takes off.
[61:41.80]Move!
[61:57.71]What does that say?
[61:58.37]It's right out here.
[62:02.17]There's a seagull on the beach.
[62:05.53]Use the essential oil.
[62:12.82]It's the Chad stride.
[62:14.22]The Panic Chad.
[62:15.96]That's pretty funny.
[62:17.62]Hold on.
[62:19.34]I could drink that.
[62:20.20]No, but I got hit.
[62:21.28]That's why it happened.
[62:28.15]What's the goal here?
[62:29.14]Do I even have a goal?
[62:32.60]Wait, hold on.
[62:33.70]Let me look what else is down here, because I don't even have a goal right now.
[62:36.52]Just run away from guy in the piano place.
[62:40.62]What is this?
[62:42.73]Some more lavender water.
[62:47.61]Let me just see.
[62:48.17]Okay, this wraps around.
[62:49.91]So I take him out there, run around.
[62:52.95]That's the only door I can go in.
[63:02.86]What's your favorite meme?
[63:03.96]Oh, definitely the Naruto mirror run.
[63:05.54]No, we're gonna have to do this again.
[63:18.59]Yeah, dude, mine too.
[63:22.80]Basic streamer.
[63:23.94]Come on.
[63:24.52]I'm just kidding around.
[63:25.44]You know what my favorite meme is.
[63:33.21]He does a panic special move.
[63:34.83]Out the door.
[63:46.04]Now where do I go from here?
[63:47.10]I don't have any other direction.
[63:48.38]I need a key now.
[63:53.18]Oh god.
[63:56.07]See, that's the panic move.
[63:57.57]There was another door over here.
[63:59.73]Alyssa, where are you?
[64:01.91]I'm right in front of you.
[64:04.54]Alyssa, where are you?
[64:06.90]They could have made this guy so much better if he was like... Ooh!
[64:13.48]What's this do?
[64:27.13]The lever must raise and lower the stage device.
[64:29.09]Yes.
[64:29.43]I'm gonna crash a head.
[64:32.09]I'm gonna crush his head.
[64:35.96]Uh... Did I just spawn another enemy?
[64:51.30]I think I'm a mannequin.
[64:52.12]Don't itch!
[64:53.06]Don't move.
[64:53.48]Your hair looks fine.
[64:54.48]Don't do that.
[64:55.52]Okay.
[64:55.74]Where is he?
[64:56.22]He just dropped a bunch of quarters.
[65:19.61]Ah, shit!
[65:21.07]That was for my laundry!
[65:23.35]Fuck!
[65:27.11]I win.
[65:31.97]Uh, the torso has been crushed.
[65:33.05]What a horrible death.
[65:34.37]He's holding something.
[65:38.40]A note scribbled on a tiny piece of paper.
[65:40.60]Safe combination equals bad.
[65:42.16]1014 is babe, 3403 is dead.
[65:49.84]Bad.
[65:50.94]Babe.
[65:52.84]So I need to do 1-0-3?
[65:56.97]Right?
[65:57.23]1-0-3?
[66:02.65]Nah, that's... I got it.
[66:09.40]Where's the safe that they're talking about, though?
[66:15.38]Bad, because babe.
[66:16.44]Bad, because bad.
[66:19.62]Why is that even a puzzle?
[66:20.84]I don't know.
[66:22.22]Strangely enough.
[66:24.94]The piano is drippings with goo.
[66:33.69]First person to get what that reference is to, I will give you pretend $100.
[66:38.73]A pretend.
[66:39.41]Like, oh yeah, whoa, what the heck?
[66:45.49]Like, not real.
[66:46.19]Like, pretend.
[66:53.55]Like, I put my hand out, and it's like, I pretend to give you my... Uh-oh.
[66:59.14]You're mine now.
[67:05.68]Oh, shit.
[67:07.37]I should have just kept moving, shouldn't I?
[67:11.64]No, he's regenerating.
[67:14.02]He must have taken a nap out there.
[67:15.36]What the hell?
[67:17.18]Alright, I need a safe.
[67:18.76]Come on.
[67:19.38]Duck!
[67:19.66]DUCK!
[67:50.64]He doesn't know.
[67:53.42]He doesn't know.
[67:54.47]Fuck.
[67:55.67]That was really boss.
[68:22.22]He doesn't know.
[68:24.26]Yeah, let's all, like, fucking laugh about that guy.
[68:31.44]He can't hear us.
[68:32.12]He's wearing AirPods.
[68:37.53]Yeah, don't tell him.
[68:38.69]Don't tell him!
[68:39.73]Yeah, don't tell him!
[68:42.47]So he just opened this door.
[68:45.47]Why can he open this door?
[68:51.48]And where's... I'm trapped in here.
[68:53.19]I need a safe.
[68:55.85]He has the key, then.
[68:56.91]So I need to... I gotta crush his head like a goddamn watermelon.
[69:03.30]Slow down!
[69:04.14]Slow down!
[69:06.30]What an asshole.
[69:17.44]They're all off limits.
[69:18.20]I can't open any of these doors.
[69:18.96]Is it maybe in the concert hall itself?
[69:28.54]Was it in... Oh, he's coming.
[69:30.42]He's back.
[69:30.92]He's back in... No, he was just in there.
[69:33.30]This is a safe?
[69:37.68]Oh, this is a safe right here.
[69:48.78]Hold on, the egg.
[70:25.39]Cloakroom lockers with combination locks.
[70:27.45]That memo might be helpful.
[70:29.91]103.
[70:30.21]Thank you!
[70:40.96]Master key.
[70:41.78]Now I can go back in there.
[70:45.00]But hold it safe first, though.
[70:51.32]I don't want to get soft-locked.
[70:53.35]He breaks in the door the second I press this.
[70:59.49]I can leave?
[71:00.19]Yeah, but there's a door in the concert hall that I want to open.
[71:07.10]Jerma stocks are in.
[71:08.62]Go buy.
[71:09.40]Are they?
[71:16.66]Really?
[71:16.92]I think he's in this room.
[71:25.89]He's actually just in here, isn't he?
[71:32.73]Special key.
[71:33.41]Use the master key.
[71:34.09]Yeah, this is why I wanted to come in here.
[71:40.57]Wait.
[71:56.23]Well, there's two... I can go scary way, or I can go not scary way.
[71:59.85]Oh, I don't like that angle.
[72:08.81]There doesn't seem to be anything strange here.
[72:11.35]But there is a glowy in the corner.
[72:15.21]Lavender water.
[72:16.53]Nice.
[72:19.47]Anything else in this room?
[72:25.03]Don't even think about doing it.
[72:27.56]Yeah, I know you can speed by.
[72:29.10]Don't even think about it.
[72:30.54]It's taunting me.
[72:39.27]Where the hell am I?
[72:48.05]Some sort of stage device has been lowered.
[72:50.11]I can't get through if it's not raised.
[72:51.67]God damn it.
[72:55.13]I have to go down and press that button again.
[73:01.51]Nothing on this something.
[73:02.63]It's sitting right there.
[73:08.23]Jupe sightings more frequent.
[73:09.87]We got storm signs.
[73:12.97]It's just a candle.
[73:15.09]I don't know what the heck that could be.
[73:16.59]It could be something that I need.
[73:18.49]I don't know.
[73:18.79]It's one of those survival horror video games.
[73:22.75]From the 90s.
[73:23.21]When's it gonna come out?
[73:26.94]90s?
[73:31.77]When Chad is bored, they spin Jupiter.
[73:33.37]Well, I'm glad they can find a good use of their time.
[73:39.08]Hey, what you should be doing is, when you get bored, and you don't... when you get bored with the game, open up a tab, and start, like, observe... like, get, like, some, like, physicist shit.
[73:49.91]You know?
[73:50.17]Do, like, Physicist 101.
[73:51.15]Alright, I need to... Hold on, let me check what's over here.
[74:06.00]Why have I not created a space agency?
[74:08.65]What the heck were you talking about, man?
[74:11.59]Get up!
[74:11.89]Panic?
[74:16.07]Don't think so.
[74:17.33]I'm gonna be drinking one of these.
[74:18.65]Um, isn't that supposed to alleviate panic?
[74:29.48]Did I miss something here?
[74:35.95]Why is he faster than me on the stairs?
[74:40.13]Oh, where am I going?
[74:41.21]Oh, great, a dead end with lockers.
[74:43.49]Wait a minute.
[74:47.60]Wait, no, no, no, I thought... Okay, wait, hold on.
[74:49.48]No, no, ah!
[74:50.12]Does he know I'm in here?
[74:58.60]We'll try a different place.
[75:07.70]That's not a way to go.
[75:08.88]This is though, right?
[75:10.10]That's great!
[75:11.02]Try attacking?
[75:11.96]I don't have anything.
[75:12.98]I have an empty bottle of liquor.
[75:39.52]Alright, I'm gonna lose one here.
[75:42.88]I gotta go to my safe spot.
[75:45.06]Yoink!
[75:45.50]Works every time.
[76:14.28]Are you kidding me?
[76:15.42]I was just joking.
[76:16.18]Hold on, I spilled.
[76:18.18]I was taking a sip.
[76:22.32]Uh, hold on.
[76:25.19]It's okay, it's not that bad.
[76:27.57]It's just a little coffee.
[76:41.99]Thank you for that cool original spell joke.
[76:44.87]I didn't, I didn't, I...
[76:55.73]I don't want to lose one.
[76:59.22]Oh man, that was so perfect.
[77:00.84]Alright, this time I'm gonna start... I'm gonna know that I just raised the thing.
[77:08.52]I hate this fucking bird chat run so much.
[77:12.32]Really?
[77:13.08]Come on!
[77:32.54]How is he not seeing me?
[77:36.22]Can I raise this when he's on it maybe?
[77:37.58]Maybe I can like fuck him up.
[77:39.26]Do it!
[77:39.80]Press the button!
[77:41.22]Press the button!
[77:53.04]He doesn't know where I am.
[77:54.24]He has no idea.
[77:54.96]This is the same spot, for real.
[77:56.36]I kind of want to just die, though, and restart.
[77:58.56]Because I just have to raise that and go up the stairs again.
[78:02.64]Alright, he's gone.
[78:03.38]He's gone, right?
[78:04.12]Yep, okay.
[78:23.41]I used my magic item, though.
[78:26.52]I used, like, the Frodo chainmail thing.
[78:29.36]You only get to use that once for a plot device in a movie.
[78:31.54]I don't have another one.
[78:49.14]Half-Life 2 game sounds.
[78:52.72]Just cross the bridge, get out of here, and continue your let's play of Clock Tower 3!
[79:11.15]He's gonna show up again here.
[79:14.33]He has to, right?
[79:23.00]The lantern is not lit.
[79:26.48]Told you I was gonna need that fucking candle.
[79:29.74]I told you.
[79:34.61]Everybody was like, it's just a candle.
[79:42.09]It's just a candle, dummy.
[79:44.41]It's not just a candle.
[79:45.91]Oh my god, really?
[79:49.31]You're mine now.
[79:54.65]It's too dark to cross.
[80:00.88]Where's the other candle?
[80:06.40]I can't pick that up.
[80:08.44]Why?
[80:09.56]Go?
[80:22.45]Um, what am I gonna find?
[80:23.80]A candle or a light source?
[80:25.42]Do you get why we said this is a bad game?
[80:31.84]Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[80:33.70]A candle.
[80:35.08]Maybe this way?
[80:37.00]I don't know, where am I supposed to go?
[80:54.52]Hide behind the counter?
[80:55.32]That didn't work last time.
[80:56.68]Can I just leave?
[81:07.84]I have the key, right?
[81:10.43]I can just leave!
[81:14.77]I can go out the front door!
[81:16.05]I'm trying to find elaborate ways to get out of here.
[81:29.14]Oh, God.
[81:29.80]You're mine now.
[81:37.54]It's a fountain.
[81:38.14]It's not a holy water fountain.
[81:44.61]Oh!
[81:47.23]Is there a candle or something out here?
[81:49.81]Is there a light out here?
[81:51.62]A candle?
[81:53.36]A light source?
[81:55.12]A way to light the way?
[82:09.53]Don't panic, please.
[82:10.83]Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.
[82:13.17]Go out, out, out, out.
[82:15.11]Leave me alone.
[82:16.81]Leave me alone.
[82:18.97]Get away from me.
[82:20.71]No!
[82:30.48]Stop panicking!
[82:32.06]Stop!
[82:33.38]Why?
[82:44.10]Okay.
[82:44.44]I don't- I don't want to softlock myself.
[82:46.92]Where the- why the fuck am I supposed to go?
[82:53.13]It's not that way either.
[82:54.19]Rude people!
[82:55.55]Use the water?
[82:57.87]Because the water doesn't work, does it?
[83:12.32]I'm actually glad that happened.
[83:13.66]You know why I'm glad that happened?
[83:15.10]Because going up stairs was a waste of time, and I used a couple of items for no reason.
[83:21.51]So, I'm just gonna walk out the front goddamn door.
[83:29.39]This is right before I raised the thing.
[83:31.94]No, it's not.
[83:36.28]It autosaved.
[83:47.66]There was a sigil.
[83:49.14]There was a sigil on one of the doors, wasn't there?
[83:53.69]I'm just trying to lose him.
[83:56.03]I'm trying to find, like, a good place where I can, like, lose him out here.
[83:59.63]Give me some holy water.
[84:18.80]Alright, holy water is about to be achieved.
[84:20.86]Got it.
[84:21.30]And let's just save it here anyways.
[84:25.11]0, 0, 0?
[84:25.51]Oh, there it is.
[84:26.23]I'm gonna go YouTube the ending because Jerma's never going to beat this game.
[84:47.36]Am I not expected to?
[84:48.58]Alright, holy water.
[84:50.04]Where is he?
[84:50.74]Where is he?
[84:51.57]He lost me.
[85:03.83]Back up here.
[85:04.73]There's a door.
[85:05.63]There's a sigil on one of the doors.
[85:08.38]He's already back.
[85:33.57]It'd be impossible for him to know that I was here.
[85:42.15]There's no way he would know I was here.
[85:53.73]Now he's sniffing the air.
[85:55.17]God damn it.
[85:55.93]I'm like a pie on a windowsill.
[85:58.27]No!
[85:59.44]Don't come in here.
[86:07.71]I'm good.
[86:08.73]Okay.
[86:09.17]Let's get a save point with two dashes of holy water.
[86:22.24]So now it was upstairs, not... It was back where the lockers were.
[86:29.96]I forget how to get there.
[86:41.51]So, it was up here.
[86:49.47]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[86:56.86]Other side.
[87:01.62]What?
[87:03.74]Are you playing the piano again?
[87:06.18]Oh, you're back!
[87:06.74]Hey!
[87:08.41]Can we talk?
[87:09.87]She's playing the piano so earnestly.
[87:11.53]What is she trying to express?
[87:19.37]Good thing I have one still.
[87:22.27]That's scary.
[87:23.13]Of course I'm going to throw holy water at the scary thing at the piano.
[87:27.95]I didn't know if she was going to turn and jump scare me or try to eat me or bite me or something.
[87:31.56]I don't know.
[87:44.49]God damn it, where is he?
[87:46.11]You're mine now.
[87:47.89]Really could have used that second splash of holy water, couldn't you, Jeremy?
[87:51.61]Instead of throwing it at the little ghost girl.
[87:53.96]Alright, where is it?
[87:56.92]Where's the door?
[88:00.14]Right there?
[88:19.26]Go!
[88:19.64]Get in the door!
[88:20.54]Get in the door!
[88:21.28]What are you doing?
[88:21.90]Oh yeah!
[88:24.26]Okay.
[88:32.49]This is the stadium seating.
[88:41.94]These are the less expensive seats.
[88:47.18]Check all the corners.
[88:47.96]Okay, there's a door here.
[88:50.91]I don't know what this is going to lead to.
[88:55.71]It's locked on the other side.
[88:56.83]We need a light source.
[89:01.96]This is just open.
[89:03.74]Ooh, this is pretty disheveled.
[89:06.44]I wonder who invented this instrument anyway.
[89:09.96]The harp?
[89:13.25]I don't know.
[89:15.89]The harp is a really kind of fucked up item, isn't it?
[89:20.01]There we go.
[89:20.89]Matches.
[89:24.05]The harp is like a gigantic underwater guitar.
[89:29.76]It's huge and strange.
[89:31.86]Looks like it belongs in a Disney movie.
[89:38.60]Sounds beautiful, though.
[89:39.44]It's a beautiful instrument.
[89:45.33]Alright, I got what I needed.
[89:48.91]Nothing else down here.
[89:49.69]When am I gonna be rid of this guy?
[90:01.40]Is he not even gonna give me a chance out of the cutscene?
[90:03.84]I gotta drink that lavender potion right now before I go into a panic drink.
[90:09.56]Okay, hold on here.
[90:17.30]It's a high-quality bait right there.
[90:18.86]Can I go underneath this?
[90:22.46]Oh, I can't.
[90:25.50]Thank God.
[90:27.26]Is he stuck?
[90:28.26]Was I supposed to do that?
[90:35.67]Invisibility band.
[90:36.47]Should I use this?
[90:39.51]Oh, shit.
[90:40.93]Oh, shit.
[90:41.31]Can he get through?
[90:41.87]No, he can't.
[90:43.25]I've got to block this guy.
[90:47.66]Alright, let's go light the torch.
[90:49.28]Can't find me.
[90:52.62]Should I just sit in one of the seats?
[90:54.26]Hi!
[91:16.90]There's like a chest over there.
[91:17.92]I can't even do anything.
[91:18.97]I have to just leave.
[91:28.49]Terrible at hiding.
[91:30.21]There is no hiding.
[91:31.84]It's one of those tank control games where you can't even see the- where they give you one camera angle.
[91:44.87]There is light.
[91:46.63]I just need to light that thing.
[91:55.98]He's already on me!
[91:58.72]Alright, I need to...
[92:17.25]Can I do the invisibility band?
[92:18.41]Take.
[92:19.65]I'm gonna do it here.
[92:22.37]I'm invisible now.
[92:23.84]Just enough to... Light.
[92:49.25]The light from the lantern illuminates the room.
[92:53.37]Fuck.
[93:01.01]I don't want to screw this up.
[93:02.29]How do I stop that from happening?
[93:03.35]How am I... Why am I doing that?
[93:06.65]I didn't read the manual about walking across the board.
[93:16.50]At this point, just fall forward, okay?
[93:22.19]Pliers.
[93:25.07]The door with the barbed wire on it.
[93:26.41]Where was that door, though?
[93:28.69]There was that barbed wire door.
[93:31.96]Which one was that?
[93:32.72]Where was that?
[93:38.56]Bottom floor?
[93:46.42]Start of the game.
[93:47.02]It was in the house.
[93:50.53]I know I saw it somewhere.
[93:53.01]Don't fall off and make me start over.
[93:54.59]Should I put on the Harry Potter invisibility cloak?
[93:59.59]Please.
[94:04.04]Fall joke incoming.
[94:05.18]I'm not going to do that.
[94:06.26]Not in a game like this.
[94:12.96]That requires backtracking and then I have a save point from... Oh, here we go again.
[94:23.28]I think that's my mother.
[94:24.40]That's gonna be my mom.
[94:28.81]Backtracking but with a secret door?
[94:34.52]Um... What do I... What do I do about this?
[94:39.06]Mom, help me!
[94:40.20]Mom, I can't...
[94:49.89]I didn't- I got put in- I got out of the cutscene.
[94:52.89]Okay, out of the cutscene.
[94:54.53]I couldn't move.
[95:02.95]It worked!
[95:03.67]It worked!
[95:04.23]Come on!
[95:13.56]Come on, come on, come on!
[95:14.54]Out, out, out, out, out!
[95:21.27]Okay, I gotta get- I just gotta leave.
[95:25.71]What the fuck?
[95:26.61]Where did you come from?
[95:28.25]Where am I going?
[95:29.17]Oh no, I had to go the other way.
[95:30.49]Shit!
[95:30.89]Leave!
[95:53.71]Okay, I'm fine.
[96:02.13]Out the door.
[96:02.83]Leave.
[96:03.09]Don't get stuck on shit.
[96:07.13]Oh, hey mom!
[96:09.61]You know, you could fly in his face and sprinkle dust in his eyes.
[96:13.76]I have to do it.
[96:33.03]Hey Jerma, I'm back from YouTubing the ending and this game is fucking whack.
[96:39.95]Thanks.
[96:40.37]Okay, I have your- I hate this guy.
[97:04.56]Here's the plan.
[97:06.92]Refill.
[97:09.08]Splash and eyes.
[97:10.08]Refill.
[97:13.30]No, no, no.
[97:14.77]I don't want to save it right here.
[97:18.25]Refill.
[97:18.99]And then... Ah.
[97:19.57]Refill.
[97:31.15]Run.
[97:33.03]Come on, Mom!
[97:38.01]What the fuck are you doing, Mom?
[97:39.37]Hey!
[97:39.93]What the hell are you doing?
[97:42.29]Why did you do that to me?
[97:45.34]You're supposed to be guiding me!
[97:49.12]Do that to him!
[97:59.61]They made that... You don't introduce a character like that.
[98:04.03]The floating, purple, glittery butterfly.
[98:09.44]Oh, I'm guiding you.
[98:10.58]Look, I'm here.
[98:11.70]And it's a bad guy.
[98:13.60]That was great.
[98:21.14]That's not your mom or an ally.
[98:23.12]I don't know.
[98:24.12]Butterflies and... It's a video game.
[98:26.52]No, I want the save point that I had.
[98:27.82]No, I didn't have it.
[98:33.84]Come on, how am I supposed to think?
[98:35.26]It's a horror game.
[98:36.61]And there's a shiny, beautiful butterfly that has been shown a few times during the game.
[98:44.29]I need to... I'm dead.
[98:51.11]Hit it.
[98:53.27]Out.
[98:54.61]Watch out for the butterfly.
[98:57.55]The sonar stingray thing that just flies around.
[99:01.78]The bat.
[99:09.56]Uh, Lake.
[99:10.28]Thank you, Lake Drinker, for the five community subs.
[99:20.87]Alright, where's that room?
[99:21.81]It's like down here?
[99:26.71]I don't even- I have no idea.
[99:30.28]In here?
[99:30.58]In here?
[99:30.88]It's not down here, is it?
[99:33.56]Aww.
[99:33.82]There it is!
[99:51.35]Pliers go in door.
[99:52.73]How do I lose this guy?
[99:58.31]Okay, I think I'm safe.
[100:01.66]Am I safe?
[100:03.88]I think so.
[100:07.58]A carved wooden box.
[100:08.88]Open it.
[100:09.64]Yes.
[100:18.03]Is this supposed to be me?
[100:26.46]Oh, you're doing a very good job playing the piano, Lisa.
[100:29.85]That's the big reveal.
[100:30.63]Like, what the fuck?
[100:31.33]It's that guy's voice.
[100:35.01]Daddy, you're home early.
[100:38.13]May, I have to tell you something important.
[100:41.58]Daddy's going off to war.
[100:44.44]War?
[100:46.42]I hate the thought of leaving you here all alone.
[100:49.18]I feel dreadful.
[100:52.13]I'll be alright.
[100:53.82]But what about you?
[100:55.40]You'll miss me and be sad when you're in war, won't you?
[100:59.29]Yes.
[100:59.95]Yes, I will.
[101:00.41]You're the most precious thing to me in the whole world.
[101:03.65]But don't worry.
[101:05.37]Daddy, don't forget the piano concourse is on Christmas Eve.
[101:09.01]The winner will have their performance aired on the radio.
[101:12.24]I'll practice really hard and win the contest so that you can hear me when you're out in the war.
[101:18.06]Is this like the narrator from Peppa Pig?
[101:20.53]She sounds like she's like 50.
[101:56.86]What a weird piano.
[102:01.73]Wait, what the fuck?
[102:26.22]They do this.
[102:41.95]What the fuck?
[102:44.53]That was too, that was too fast.
[102:48.23]That was too fast.
[102:50.41]Oh my god, that was awful.
[102:59.91]Holy shit.
[103:05.01]I didn't even have any time to fucking process what I just looked at.
[103:09.14]It was just, all of a sudden the guy flies.
[103:12.26]Oh, oh my god.
[103:13.84]Alright, uh, the hammer killer.
[103:27.32]Robert Morris, 32, the man known as the Hammer Killer, has been hanged.
[103:31.45]Rumors regarding Morris' death are widespread.
[103:33.67]One witness reported he was hanging for a very long time, pulling on the straps and making unearthly noises, and blood was oozing through the black cap.
[103:41.87]The stench was terrible.
[103:43.12]Some witnesses fainted and were carried out.
[103:46.42]This is too many things.
[103:47.74]Can we just go back to when they were playing the piano?
[103:49.92]Too many things happened in a row here.
[103:53.10]Morris's first victim was Tony Flanagan, a fellow employee at the Banbury stone cutting factory.
[104:00.39]On June 6th, Morris suddenly struck Flanagan on the head with a hammer.
[104:30.15]Sensory overload.
[104:30.89]I'm sorry, guys.
[104:32.37]None of this is, like, comedic.
[104:33.39]It's just, like, too much sensory overload.
[104:35.61]Kind of like the last five minutes of the game.
[104:59.59]An extreme, abrupt change in tone.
[105:09.25]Maybe I can save Mae if I get her father's pocket watch to her.
[105:12.25]Okay.
[105:12.63]I have to take the pocket watch to the concert hall.
[105:22.66]Okay.
[105:24.36]Is that guy still here?
[105:30.89]The stream will pause suddenly for no- I got no drop frames.
[105:36.63]I have zero drop frames so far.
[105:37.89]Is the stream having a problem?
[105:47.70]It was muting you.
[105:49.84]Oh.
[105:50.48]That's weird.
[105:51.50]I don't know why.
[105:51.96]Alright, so I get the pocket watch back to mom.
[105:58.03]I have to take the pocket watch to the concert hall.
[106:03.83]Your voice is bad.
[106:05.07]Like, sound quality coming through, or you just think you don't like how I sound, you hate my accent or something?
[106:30.98]Alright, here he comes.
[106:32.53]Back to the concert hall.
[106:40.58]Extreme.
[106:57.99]No butterflies?
[106:58.97]What is that?
[107:00.49]There's a glowing thing down there.
[107:02.55]Is there a way I can get down here?
[107:07.26]Yes, there is.
[107:08.06]Yes, yes, yes.
[107:15.80]Oh, cool.
[107:18.52]Lavender water.
[107:27.24]Stop calling them butterflies, they're moths!
[107:36.24]What's it say?
[107:41.35]Hee hee hee hee, lamp!
[107:42.63]Hee hee, what does that mean?
[107:52.53]Am I mad?
[107:53.11]No.
[107:59.04]He doesn't know.
[107:59.98]He doesn't know.
[108:00.52]Alyssa.
[108:04.66]Alyssa.
[108:07.21]Yeah, I've been waiting for you.
[108:10.05]You figured me out, little girl.
[108:12.35]It's the killer.
[108:14.83]It's the hammer killer.
[108:16.59]They thought they got rid of me that day when it got us together.
[108:20.05]Little May was only the beginning.
[108:21.93]Why?
[108:22.19]Why did you kill her?
[108:25.97]You're next.
[108:29.98]A lot of just random... Alright.
[108:34.88]Boss battles.
[108:35.66]This is an actual boss battle.
[108:38.82]Control... Duck.
[108:40.58]Shoot arrow.
[108:43.18]What?
[108:43.52]I have arrows.
[108:46.22]Shoot arrow.
[108:47.10]Charge arrow.
[108:48.03]Super attack.
[108:50.39]Hold down triangle button or hold down triangle button with enemy transfixed.
[108:55.51]R1 is special.
[108:59.86]Battle Strategy.
[109:00.74]In order to defeat the enemy, Alyssa must first transfix it.
[109:04.40]By hitting the enemy with a charged arrow, it is possible to fix them to the spot.
[109:09.89]Several strategically placed chains will transfix the target.
[109:14.77]Aim so that the chains fan out from the target, who should be in the center.
[109:20.29]While the enemy is transfixed, Elissa is able to carry out a super attack.
[109:24.11]It is no easy task, however, to hit the target with the arrow.
[109:27.27]Watch the enemy's movements closely and wait for your chance.
[109:30.87]Duck can be used to avoid attack by certain enemies.
[109:33.63]It may also cause them to become careless and vulnerable to attack.
[109:37.07]Press the A1 button to use special arrows such as the repellent arrow in order in which they were obtained.
[109:45.35]It is wise to save these weapons for special occasions.
[109:50.48]So let me get this straight.
[109:51.71]So shoot arrow is triangle.
[109:53.79]You want to charge the arrow and then shoot him with the charged arrow to transfix them.
[110:02.15]So you've locked them in a spot and then there will be chains that are placed around the map here that will transfix them.
[110:12.68]So the chains fan out from the target should be in the center of the target.
[110:17.04]Let's just... I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[110:26.22]Am I actually getting... Am I gonna do a transformation sequence here?
[110:30.08]I am.
[110:31.18]Now, don't come out in the superhero outfit, please.
[110:41.50]Here comes the transform sequence.
[110:42.94]Hopefully we get some, like, pop music behind.
[110:49.86]No, it's just a staple gun.
[110:57.41]Somehow she knows how to use it.
[110:59.47]Uh, if you're done, I'd like to begin.
[111:10.64]Sledgehammer!
[111:13.20]Victim's 26.
[111:13.70]Sentenced to 486 years in prison.
[111:16.46]I have to- wait, I'm the judge?
[111:17.74]Judgment!
[111:25.29]This is a different video game.
[111:37.50]Okay.
[111:39.66]Get off, Alyssa!
[111:40.34]So there's also evade too.
[111:44.17]I can evade attacks.
[111:54.95]That didn't transfix.
[111:55.83]Where are the chains?
[111:58.17]There must be chains.
[112:00.21]Like, I can't even pause it because I'm gonna go off on a fucking rant right now.
[112:04.79]I gotta go off on a rant.
[112:05.81]Okay, I can pause it.
[112:08.97]Let me, okay.
[112:10.89]I understand like driving around like cars is cool and like it's fun to drive around a car.
[112:15.11]But are you just driving around in a circle?
[112:19.86]You know, like what are you doing?
[112:22.79]Like you, okay, drive fast here.
[112:26.74]But are you just driving in like a four mile circle over and over again?
[112:36.26]How many times can you do that before it's like, ah, this is like, I'm kind of just doing this over and over again.
[112:44.36]Go stand in the road.
[112:46.71]Excuse me.
[112:53.43]It's almost like this is on an NPC route.
[112:56.95]That's an AI doing that.
[113:05.54]That's like a GTA NPC.
[113:08.10]It's just driving around in a circle.
[113:15.82]It's just that picture of the guy standing in front of the... Wait, what?
[113:21.43]I think that's Vegas for you.
[113:22.89]I haven't seen what the fuck is happening.
[113:25.63]Imagine if every five minutes I just went, Hey!
[113:30.04]Every day.
[113:31.30]You know how irritating that would be for people that live in this house?
[113:37.20]Okay, what's for dinner?
[113:38.51]Well, we're going to have carrots and meatloaf.
[113:41.51]Hey!
[113:43.25]Okay, thanks, Jeremy.
[113:44.33]We're going to have carrots and meatloaf.
[113:45.73]Alright, is that a chain over there?
[113:52.48]No, I just run around the house and I scream when I pass people's doors.
[113:56.96]Alright, this looks like a chain.
[114:00.65]Got it, right?
[114:04.72]No.
[114:05.28]No!
[114:06.10]Shoot the chain?
[114:24.90]He's blocking.
[114:25.60]What about duck?
[114:27.34]That didn't work.
[114:32.42]Pin him to the wall?
[114:33.26]Yeah, but this is three of them, right?
[114:37.48]Come over here.
[114:44.44]I mean, it's hurting him.
[114:59.27]Arrow needs to be charged more.
[115:01.19]He has a Seismic Wave.
[115:06.21]So let's see if I can get it.
[115:11.96]One, two, three, four... Alright, but there it is.
[115:17.32]Okay.
[115:19.18]One, two, three... How far can he move with that?
[115:27.21]Okay, again.
[115:28.47]One, two, three, four, five.
[115:32.51]Alright, now he's held in place.
[115:33.45]Now I can just shoot him.
[115:35.59]How long is he in that for?
[115:49.48]Keep charging!
[115:53.33]Keep charging it.
[115:54.15]How?
[115:54.61]Really?
[115:55.49]One, two, three, four, five!
[116:02.00]That's a max arrow.
[116:08.64]Is this Mega Man X?
[116:13.89]I knew, like, the charge and how it worked, but I didn't know that it had, like, seven levels of charge.
[116:27.73]R1?
[116:29.69]R1.
[116:29.83]What the hell am I doing?
[116:40.26]Okay!
[116:44.82]I call upon Zeus himself to draw the lightning!
[116:53.61]This game makes no sense.
[116:55.55]Yeah, that was a limit break.
[117:17.44]Your sentence?
[117:20.21]Eternity.
[117:32.28]Clover of Love.
[117:35.62]Alright, now we gotta go bring the locket back to mom.
[117:48.11]Let's save the game, just in case something really bad happens.
[117:54.81]Hey, uh, Morty!
[117:57.05]Hey, do you guys know that there's like 12 more seasons of Rick and Morty that are gonna come on the way?
[118:01.39]Did you know that?
[118:05.17]There's gonna be like 15 seasons of Rick and Morty.
[118:08.67]They've already been ordered.
[118:09.41]At least like 9 more seasons have already been ordered.
[118:12.29]So all you guys that are like, I don't like Rick and Morty.
[118:16.21]Got like 10 more years of this shit.
[118:23.97]It's a bad joke.
[118:29.41]Auto voice.
[118:30.71]Mom, I've got something for you!
[118:37.59]General confirmed Rick and Morty.
[118:42.04]I'm not like a fan of Rick and Morty.
[118:50.48]Hydrate.
[118:50.96]I refuse.
[118:58.80]May, your father is dead.
[119:03.08]There was an explosion.
[119:04.14]A shell.
[119:05.30]I'm so sorry.
[119:09.93]Please don't cry.
[119:12.23]I understand how you feel.
[119:14.09]I never even knew my father.
[119:16.09]I lost him soon after I was born, but I love my grandfather just the way you love your father.
[119:24.03]Isn't she dead?
[119:27.61]This person's not rea- What?
[119:35.90]Yeah, this person's a ghost.
[119:38.64]Why would I say that?
[119:41.36]Yes, just keep playing the piano forever.
[119:45.32]By the way, your father's dead.
[119:46.54]Oh, so she can move on.
[119:53.26]Oh, I get it.
[119:56.22]Thank you, May.
[119:57.68]Your beautiful playing has brought me back to you.
[120:00.28]At last, we can be together again.
[120:04.66]Thank you, Alyssa.
[120:06.72]Thank you.
[120:07.80]Thank you.
[120:08.86]So was he the serial killer?
[120:10.72]No, no, no, no, no.
[120:11.84]He was in the war.
[120:12.74]Okay, right.
[120:13.32]No.
[120:14.82]Goodbye.
[120:15.42]That looks... Goodbye.
[120:19.32]I'm not, this is not fun, this... The subject matter is not funny, okay?
[120:23.52]Let me just be very clear about something.
[120:25.37]The subject...
[120:46.02]It's the presentation that is kind of all over the place, as you can plainly see.
[120:51.07]The subject matter is not, like, funny, but... But the way that they were, like, floating up, like, a Teletubbies episode, like, what the hell was that?
[121:28.64]Oh, it's the serial killer back again.
[121:30.11]What the fuck is going on?
[121:42.29]What is he- Help him!
[121:46.14]Help this guy!
[121:54.41]I thought I was a goner for sure.
[121:56.35]Look at all these weird animations.
[121:58.37]I haven't seen you since we were in primary school together.
[122:01.19]It must be three years.
[122:03.99]What do you think you're doing entering a lady's residence through a window?
[122:06.91]I have to give you something.
[122:08.73]Where's Harry?
[122:09.87]Here it is.
[122:10.29]It's the key to my grandfather's room.
[122:13.55]Mother always had this key with her.
[122:15.33]What are you doing with it?
[122:18.37]Why is he rolling around like he's covered in bees or ants?
[122:22.17]You can't go that fast.
[122:22.89]This is an extreme pantomime.
[122:23.87]What is happening?
[122:43.63]This reminds me of, like, bad theater.
[122:48.03]They blocked out and choreographed this scene.
[122:49.65]It's such a terrible theater production.
[122:51.05]It's a bad play.
[122:52.27]This is fucking so stupid.
[123:04.75]I'll be right back.
[123:05.31]I'm gonna take a piss.
[123:06.17]I'll be back in fucking two minutes.
[126:49.53]Okay.
[126:51.71]Let us continue.
[127:00.00]This game is ridiculous.
[127:04.70]So I have the key to Dick's room.
[127:07.28]Is this my house?
[127:13.78]I'm very confused.
[127:14.60]Do I have a map of this place?
[127:18.27]Wrong button.
[127:23.82]I just got here.
[127:24.44]When does he play Apex Legends?
[127:29.89]Apex Legends.
[127:35.93]The door has been boarded up.
[127:39.81]Wait, why do I still need to do this?
[127:44.95]Why would you put a spell on the bathroom?! !
[127:53.51]That's next level, don't go in there.
[127:55.55]You took, like, such a big dump in here.
[127:58.17]That you really don't want somebody to go in.
[128:01.68]A dead body in here.
[128:03.84]One of the lodges.
[128:04.82]View, what a stink.
[128:09.62]Um... Get off me, please!
[128:21.11]Uh...
[128:24.29]Nancy.
[128:24.75]I'm gonna go to Dick's room.
[128:31.14]The three-way mirror has been folded up.
[128:35.96]What else you got here?
[128:39.36]What a dumb painting.
[128:41.88]What was wrong with the first one?
[128:48.69]Oh, alright, so there's another painting stuck under the first one.
[128:53.42]This one has a clock on it.
[128:55.35]And it is at 3 p.m.
[129:01.91]Throw that one in the trash.
[129:02.99]Why is this here?
[129:03.57]Alright, 3 p.m.
[129:05.09]Is that 3 p.m.
[129:05.83]or is that... 12.15?
[129:07.79]Well, it's either 3 or 12.15.
[129:14.70]This is Mom's bed.
[129:23.49]Alright, well now we have- well, here we go.
[129:25.85]The clock has stopped ticking.
[129:27.13]You'll need a special winding key to get it working again.
[129:30.84]Of course I do.
[129:36.04]Mom had a lot of shit, huh?
[129:38.30]This desk is in such a dumb place.
[129:40.90]What is the feng shui in here?
[129:42.52]Why do you have a desk in the middle of your room?
[129:45.48]Two desks.
[129:48.67]What a sloppy- look at this nightstand!
[129:50.37]Why is the bed here?
[129:57.53]I would appreciate it if you didn't.
[130:01.71]Change the camera on me.
[130:02.70]There's a computer on the desk.
[130:03.86]I wish I had one too.
[130:06.72]What's this?
[130:07.10]I'm gonna sneeze.
[130:09.70]I couldn't get it.
[130:10.24]I'm sorry.
[130:10.62]It just happens sometimes.
[130:13.12]I couldn't do it.
[130:16.10]Okay.
[130:20.76]Nothing else?
[130:22.26]I have Dick's key.
[130:26.94]Mom must know what's going on.
[130:29.19]Well, where is Mom?
[130:31.35]Must have left in a hurry.
[130:32.21]The wardrobe is still open.
[130:39.25]Why is there a ghost?
[130:39.83]Is that Mom in the bathtub?
[130:42.12]I don't know.
[130:42.72]Who is that?
[130:50.42]Why is there just a ghost in the house?
[130:57.59]Alright, we need to find Dick's Room.
[131:03.19]Let me look at the map again.
[131:05.55]Do I have a legend or anything?
[131:06.79]Is there a way I can get to the appendix of this legend?
[131:14.25]Of this map?
[131:15.17]Get to the legend?
[131:18.13]I'm looking for the appendix.
[131:18.99]Oh, Apex Legend is what I'm looking for.
[131:25.18]Don't.
[131:26.20]Don't do it.
[131:30.49]Don't.
[131:32.35]Couldn't I crawl through here before?
[131:37.89]Don't.
[131:42.54]This is Alyssa's room.
[131:43.86]Is he still in here?
[131:48.74]It's as if that nightmare never took place.
[131:55.85]Wait, what's across the way?
[131:56.61]Is that dick?
[132:05.32]Is this going to be a clock tower stream?
[132:10.40]Nothing of interest here.
[132:12.46]Who is it?
[132:12.96]Philip?
[132:14.02]Damn it.
[132:14.30]I don't know.
[132:18.80]I'm just kind of playing it.
[132:21.18]I knew I was going to play this for at least a couple hours.
[132:23.14]I knew it.
[132:24.28]Just by...
[132:26.10]The first 20 minutes.
[132:27.82]Well, let's just save it at least.
[132:35.08]And that's what happens.
[132:36.04]Sometimes you get locked in one.
[132:43.31]I was promised 12 hours.
[132:44.91]No, one of these games has a 12 hour timer on it.
[132:49.15]And I don't know what to do with it.
[132:51.61]I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with it.
[132:57.56]I need to find the right moment to play that game.
[133:00.00]Alright, where's Dick's room?
[133:10.80]Filled with art and antiques.
[133:11.94]Grandfather used to collect these things.
[133:13.28]Right.
[133:16.47]It's locked.
[133:16.95]The lodges won't be coming back.
[133:18.15]Alright, I need to find this room.
[133:25.71]Well, that was a random find.
[133:29.28]He didn't even have a label on his door.
[133:31.72]Your room is really, really weird, too.
[133:36.76]All these old books.
[133:37.62]What was he studying?
[133:41.73]Dark magics.
[133:42.53]Alright, if you got this many books, it might be time to donate some of them.
[133:54.88]There is a scribbled note.
[133:56.40]The keys to the mystery of time lie behind you.
[134:04.68]What a stupid note.
[134:06.50]Book of entities 1.
[134:10.03]Entities have existed in the human realm since Roman days.
[134:14.11]These beings have been known to possess innocent humans, imbuing them with utter ruthlessness and cruelty and often driving the possessed to vicious acts of murder.
[134:24.94]In such cases, executing the murderer does not break the circle of evil.
[134:30.10]The possessed is resurrected to continue its bloodthirsty mission.
[134:35.05]Those who are thus controlled by entities are known as Apex Legends.
[134:42.21]When a subordinate kills a human, they take nourishment from the victim's soul and their power grows.
[134:51.34]Subordinates may acquire an infinite amount of power in this manner.
[134:54.18]It follows, then, that subordinates are sustained by human misery and suffering.
[134:59.57]Only certain humans are equipped to fight entities and their subordinates.
[135:03.51]The rooters, the tootin' rooters, who are always young women in their teens, have been battling against these shadowy enemies for hundreds of years.
[135:15.24]Their war is likely to continue for many centuries to come.
[135:19.67]Yes, it does.
[135:20.69]Yes, it will.
[135:22.32]considering the amount of 500 years in the future after this game takes place, animes with the same exact plot as this game.
[135:46.29]Serpents!
[135:48.09]Teenage girls who stand against the... Dude, I'm thinking about getting that as like a tat, like the serpent eating its own serpent.
[135:53.81]Did you find anything in there, Alyssa?
[135:57.18]What's that?
[136:06.36]Entity?
[136:08.57]What's an entity?
[136:09.91]And the Rudas...
[136:12.52]It wasn't a dream.
[136:13.62]Why the fuck are you dressed like Freddy Krueger?
[136:15.60]I'm going to look for my mother.
[136:16.96]You want to look for your mother?
[136:18.24]But she was in a car, remember?
[136:19.76]She could be anywhere by now.
[136:21.18]She's nearby.
[136:21.90]I can tell.
[136:24.43]What do you mean?
[136:27.91]It doesn't matter.
[136:28.93]Just go home.
[136:29.79]Let me help you.
[136:30.99]Just the two of us.
[136:32.27]It'll be like the old days.
[136:34.20]That was a long time ago.
[136:35.28]I might as well help you.
[136:37.16]There's nothing to do at home.
[136:40.40]This is our new contact.
[136:41.36]There they are again.
[136:42.24]Yep.
[136:42.52]Has it been ten minutes?
[136:44.27]Isn't it your birthday tomorrow?
[137:13.11]All of a sudden a bunch of like fucking Chili's employees come out and they're like Happy birthday to you.
[137:20.41]Happy birthday and they bring a shitty cupcake with a one candle in it He went out really fast Like Looney Tunes fast
[137:41.59]Okay.
[137:43.09]A scribbled note.
[137:43.59]Yeah, the keys to the mystery of time lie behind you.
[137:46.07]So over here.
[137:48.95]These old books.
[137:49.53]What was he studying?
[137:50.19]Something in the chair.
[137:51.23]In his chair.
[137:55.07]I went to a place that charged us for the birthday thing.
[138:00.47]See, what you have to do is you go with, you know, you want to do like a funny prank.
[138:07.25]Get, like, 15 people to go as groups of, like, two in different places in the restaurant.
[138:13.73]And it's everybody's birthday today.
[138:15.95]So they have to go around and do the birthday thing to, like, 15 different parties.
[138:21.74]And, like, you tip them a fucking... You tip them, like, fucking 500 bucks after that, by the way.
[138:44.22]I would fucking hate you if you did that.
[138:46.36]You don't do that!
[138:53.33]Money does not forgive your sins.
[139:08.31]If you tipped me $150, I would spill boiling soup on your lap.
[139:14.34]Why?
[139:16.48]Wait, hold on.
[139:17.62]So, if at the end of the meal, it was like I wrote it, oh yeah, that was like $42 for the food, alright, that's fine.
[139:25.36]Here's $150 for a tip.
[139:27.71]You're going to take that receipt, you're going to look at it, you're going to go, oh, $150.
[139:31.49]I'm going to drop boiling soup on him.
[139:34.29]Where's the disconnect happen there?
[139:43.21]I'm trying to figure that out.
[139:46.55]So don't tip at that person!
[139:50.15]Alright.
[139:50.99]What do I need to do?
[139:51.55]I need to find the magic.
[139:55.57]Did I get anything in my inventory?
[139:56.51]It was behind you the whole time.
[140:06.10]Jewel saved like a clove leaf has strange powers.
[140:13.52]No, I tip.
[140:15.42]I tip.
[140:16.02]At least.
[140:17.13]Every time I go out to eat, or pretty much any time I have the slip that has a slot for gratuity, it doesn't matter what it is.
[140:25.05]It's always, as long as, you know, the service was decent, it was a friendly atmosphere, I give at least 25%.
[140:30.54]Sure.
[140:30.64]Liar?
[140:30.74]What?
[140:30.92]What?
[140:47.50]Mr. Moneybags.
[140:48.72]Hey, take 100.
[140:49.84]Take one.
[140:52.38]He's a liar.
[141:01.96]Yo, this guy's loaded.
[141:03.78]What?
[141:04.30]No.
[141:05.44]Oh!
[141:12.49]I give at least 45%.
[141:20.57]I believe that you seem like the type to make a real pain for waiters.
[141:23.65]What?
[141:24.07]No, I'm like so, so accommodating and so easy.
[141:27.99]I'm not.
[141:29.55]Those of you guys who know me, come on.
[141:31.55]Like, I'm not... I know like the, oh, I bet I'm at a grocery store and he went like, coffee, Cheetos, and like snapped in my face and like burped and then like threw his plate on the ground.
[141:40.82]I know that those like memes are out there.
[141:42.78]Don't believe them.
[141:43.24]They're all fake.
[141:51.84]I'm very easy.
[141:52.70]Okay, I need to figure out where the hell I need to go.
[142:01.69]The thing actually said, look behind you.
[142:06.47]So I need to go back there, don't I?
[142:07.79]I didn't really progress.
[142:14.54]I got that cutscene, but I didn't know where to go after that.
[142:23.53]It's the clock.
[142:24.21]Yeah, but I need the thing.
[142:25.35]I need the... I need to do... the clock has stopped ticking.
[142:30.04]I need the winding keys.
[142:31.34]She kept yawning and pretending not to hear the cashier.
[142:46.37]Those... those coffee pastas are so stupid.
[142:53.16]I'm just walking in circles.
[142:54.30]I gotta go back to Dad's room.
[143:07.82]Yawning loudly.
[143:11.75]This is my room.
[143:12.49]I don't know where the fuck I'm going.
[143:14.71]We started talking about like tipping and I forgot where I was.
[143:17.59]I wish I could see on the map where I was standing.
[143:24.13]Is there like a... where you are now?
[143:37.49]Is this upstairs?
[143:41.40]It's right there?
[143:41.98]Do you remember the guy that sneaks vodka into... No, I don't... What are you... What?
[143:49.90]I do not do that.
[143:54.54]Right there.
[143:55.38]Why did I start talking about like tips and shit?
[143:58.28]I had this in the bag.
[143:59.26]I was going fine.
[144:16.61]Down.
[144:21.57]I got too heavily distracted.
[144:34.17]Nothing of interest here.
[144:35.03]Why don't you just go in?
[144:38.67]God, you're unbearable!
[144:42.25]Wait.
[144:47.62]This wasn't locked before.
[144:48.56]Who could have locked it?
[144:54.48]I just get so frustrated!
[144:58.14]Stupid!
[144:59.95]Ugh!
[145:09.20]Alright, I just had a lot of spit stuck in my throat there, I'm sorry.
[145:12.20]Alright, where- is there a paint- is it gonna drop?
[145:15.52]This painting's gonna drop.
[145:17.54]Oh my fucking god, of course there is.
[145:20.14]Behind the painting of dear old dad.
[145:22.70]Napoleon Dynamite.
[145:29.21]God, oh, Napoleon Dynamite.
[145:33.53]They made like five different pieces of media.
[145:38.96]from that one movie there was a cartoon there was a movie there were t-shirts there was a comic book it was out of control there's something on the wall next to the desk oh god idiot
[146:11.77]Looks like a mask used to hang here.
[146:13.95]Okay, so it's a scribbled note, yeah.
[146:24.46]Chat is really weird tonight.
[146:26.04]Why?
[146:26.32]I think they're fine.
[146:27.92]They're just having a good time.
[146:39.19]Wait, what about this one?
[146:41.95]Look at every painting.
[146:43.05]Put your stuff of your face in the lampshade.
[146:44.91]I don't think there's anything else in here.
[146:48.30]I got what I need.
[146:48.80]I got the keys.
[146:51.74]No, you're weird.
[146:54.54]Like, how am I gonna defend?
[146:55.78]How am I gonna fight that?
[147:03.76]There are things that I said yesterday.
[147:05.72]On stream.
[147:07.09]That I could tell you, I'm not, I'm not, there's nothing wrong with me.
[147:09.73]And you would clip me something that I said that I don't even remember saying.
[147:18.77]And I would be, it would be not possible for me to defend it.
[147:20.85]Alright.
[147:27.03]Put the clock, put the keys in the clock.
[147:35.65]Oh, that's the... Get off me.
[147:42.59]Is it in Nancy's room?
[147:45.68]Yes, it is.
[147:52.76]Finally.
[147:54.72]Oy.
[147:55.32]Alright.
[147:56.27]Windy keys might just work on this clock.
[147:58.11]Use them.
[148:00.91]Which key will you turn?
[148:01.97]Turn the right one.
[148:05.35]Oh, no.
[148:10.29]Oh, fuck.
[148:13.65]Oh, this is not going to be... Okay, hold on a minute here.
[148:16.56]How far does it move?
[148:18.06]It moves... Let's see.
[148:22.48]It moves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 spaces when you move left.
[148:26.90]What does it mean when you go right?
[148:32.00]1, 2, 3.
[148:33.32]Did it.
[148:33.82]Game over.
[148:34.22]I win.
[148:45.77]I just need to see how many it counted.
[148:52.11]And there's a secret door!
[148:57.80]Oh god, there's... all kinds of... There's a giant black book.
[149:04.41]Portal squares.
[149:06.45]Drawing the portal square as instructed is only the beginning.
[149:09.66]Remember, the portal square must be thoroughly purified with holy water until it has been sufficiently charged with energy for full effect.
[149:18.88]Only when the square is infused with light may the practitioner expect any groundbreaking results.
[149:25.30]So you need to do holy water and charge it.
[149:28.90]Portal squares need to be purified with holy water.
[149:31.74]I have four slices of holy water pie.
[149:39.13]What's in here?
[149:40.67]Strange medicine bottles stand in a line.
[149:44.35]There's a window.
[149:47.71]Nothing out there.
[149:48.41]Well, let's... Is that sufficiently charged?
[150:00.14]That's it, right?
[150:01.20]So what do I do now?
[150:05.06]Go in?
[150:06.82]Where the hell is this gonna take me?
[150:14.36]Time to get human transmutationed.
[150:22.04]Freight transport.
[150:23.04]Uh-oh.
[150:26.37]It's like every time travel movie and every time travel TV show.
[150:31.41]I don't have enough to go back.
[150:34.33]No, it's impossible.
[150:35.47]I don't have enough to go back.
[150:51.26]And they figure it out.
[150:52.35]They find it.
[150:57.11]Save it here.
[150:59.81]Every time a travel movie is Scottish.
[151:02.45]Yeah.
[151:04.20]Find me somebody that went back in time that didn't have an English or Scottish accent.
[151:10.56]Can you do it?
[151:20.51]Doc?
[151:21.57]From Back to the Future?
[151:23.35]Great Scott!
[151:24.59]Great Scott!
[151:25.49]Really?
[151:26.31]Oh, he didn't say anything?
[151:27.71]He wasn't like... Great Scott!
[151:30.01]Interesting.
[151:33.11]Try again.
[151:37.63]Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[151:40.06]No, sorry, he has an accent.
[151:43.30]He has a European accent.
[151:57.03]Bill and Ted.
[152:03.09]But Keanu, wait, Keanu Reeves, where's Keanu Reeves from?
[152:09.61]He's faking an American accent.
[152:15.11]Where was he born?
[152:18.43]Early life.
[152:20.93]Hey, guess what?
[152:25.12]Uh...
[152:26.56]Keanu Reeves was born in Beirut.
[152:35.01]Sorry, guys.
[152:41.99]Try again.
[153:04.91]They time travel in The Simpsons.
[153:06.11]That's not a real character.
[153:07.53]That's a... That's not real.
[153:09.19]Alright, I'm doing the thing again.
[153:17.25]Ghost Town.
[153:23.07]Dog?
[153:27.82]Uh, this is a red phantom.
[153:32.70]Teddy Bear.
[153:34.50]Do I have to give the teddy bear to the red phantom?
[153:41.24]Oh, I can hardly bear to look.
[153:43.59]There's a heart-shaped pendant in its hand.
[153:47.19]So get it.
[153:48.81]So pick it up!
[153:53.38]Seems to be locked on the other side.
[154:02.28]coming back in time.
[154:03.58]I love how people are picking out so many random obscure time travel sequences.
[154:16.55]Oh, Wheezy.
[154:25.23]Lock me at the side.
[154:26.19]I have a bear.
[154:26.83]What am I gonna do with a bear?
[154:36.78]A blind guy?
[154:43.30]Pickle Rick did it that time?
[154:46.05]Yeah, you're right.
[154:46.77]You're right.
[154:47.09]Pickle Rick did travel back in time.
[154:48.77]You're right.
[154:49.07]What's that?
[154:50.87]What's going on?
[155:11.56]Is this guy gonna be the new person I have to avoid here?
[155:25.92]Yeah, it is.
[155:26.52]I'm gonna hear the bell.
[155:29.34]New pursuer.
[155:31.16]Can I open these?
[155:39.04]Is there a reason why we have a cut scene right now?
[155:43.28]Is the guy back?
[155:49.09]Is there another person in the house?
[155:54.47]Oh, Albert, where on Earth have you forgotten?
[155:59.70]I've been waiting for you, waiting, waiting.
[156:09.55]Why are they all missing their eyes?
[156:10.61]I'm gonna get ironed in the face.
[156:32.65]What the fuck?
[156:37.05]I tripped the alarm.
[156:43.51]Sorry.
[156:43.93]I didn't know you had like a home security system.
[156:53.07]Merlin's home security.
[156:55.87]That's what would actually happen in Merlin's house.
[156:57.71]You know, like, they're like... Everything's flying around.
[157:01.37]That's what actually would happen.
[157:03.11]People would die.
[157:10.48]So, where do I have to go now?
[157:14.60]No, no more of this shit.
[157:23.47]It's the ghost from the beginning of the game.
[157:27.19]The one that dropped the pot.
[157:28.11]They don't give you very much time, do they?
[157:36.84]Unlocked.
[157:44.35]What is that?
[157:44.67]What's on the wall?
[157:45.91]A painting has been hung here.
[157:48.41]It's all crooked, though.
[157:49.27]Maybe I should straighten it.
[157:52.15]So, straighten the photo!
[158:05.79]Any door, please.
[158:08.15]Move!
[158:14.73]You're fine.
[158:15.72]Calm down.
[158:20.04]Still panicking.
[158:20.90]Alright, not panicking anymore.
[158:22.00]We have another case to open?
[158:28.10]Albert's diary.
[158:30.31]percy from the bakery gave me the name of a good optometrist in London it's been seven years now since mom lost her sight and though she tries to appear cheerful it's difficult to watch her grow old perhaps the doctor can do something to help her it would be expensive I wonder if my saves would be enough so the doctor is doing this for you relative of ours named John ha came asking if he could stay with us he's very cordial but I can't help thinking there's something calculated about him
[158:58.41]I said as much to Mother who scolded me for judging a book by its cover.
[159:02.35]I suppose she's right.
[159:03.29]Blood is thicker than water, as they say.
[159:05.02]I've been hearing strange noises late at night for the last three days or so.
[159:09.38]I heard that a team of burglars have been striking homes in the area.
[159:13.12]I must remember to lock all the doors and windows at night.
[159:18.80]Okay.
[159:23.08]It looks like a toolbox.
[159:24.36]It's locked and will not open.
[159:26.36]Do I have any keys?
[159:32.74]Stop the teddy bear.
[159:33.80]A badly burnt teddy.
[159:35.14]Was it a person... Was it a present to somebody?
[159:38.39]Do I have a... I've got a key in here, don't I?
[159:42.67]Master key.
[159:44.49]No.
[159:49.63]How did it get burnt?
[159:50.46]That's a great question.
[159:52.86]Probably from fire.
[159:55.34]Anything else in here?
[160:01.73]The vase holds a moon flower.
[160:03.83]It looks like it's been turned.
[160:05.43]Turn it.
[160:06.95]Yeah, I turned it up.
[160:09.88]North, turn up.
[160:14.02]See?
[160:25.84]Well, there's a new way to go.
[160:27.86]The ladder goes down, climb down, yes.
[160:37.10]I made it down through the chimney.
[160:39.10]That's an LOL moments voice.
[160:44.53]Yeah, it is.
[160:45.63]Where?
[160:48.79]Kitchen key.
[160:50.93]Can I give this person back their teddy bear so they can leave me the fuck alone?
[161:00.24]Half heart pendant.
[161:01.02]There's another pendant outside.
[161:02.22]Alright, let's complete that pendant.
[161:07.43]Get away from me.
[161:08.17]Fire extinguisher?
[161:09.39]They had fire extinguishers back then?
[161:10.93]I wonder if I could use it for something.
[161:15.93]I don't know.
[161:16.35]Maybe.
[161:16.61]Back outside.
[161:24.16]Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.
[161:25.34]Let's go complete that pen.
[161:28.38]The door won't open.
[161:29.30]Even when it is pushed, it won't budge.
[161:31.04]Great.
[161:40.18]Get the hell out of here.
[161:46.62]Into the kitchen.
[161:51.66]Plates, that's it, please sit in a, plates sit in a neat row.
[161:56.46]Finally.
[162:04.12]Teddy bear.
[162:07.42]News reporter memo.
[162:09.72]Found V. Very important clue to Rand's murder.
[162:13.08]We'll go back to house to investigate and gather info.
[162:15.11]Got a feeling about this.
[162:16.35]It'll be the biggest scoop in Fleet Street.
[162:18.65]A newspaper clipping is sandwiched between the pages of the notepad.
[162:22.21]Serial killer Ha meets Grizzly End.
[162:27.03]John Ha, the serial killer, on the run since early last year, has been found dead in a metal plating works.
[162:34.05]ha is held responsible for the cold-blooded murder of several pensioners whom he robbed before placing the bodies in a container of sulfuric acid thus disposing of the evidence what a sicko the acid used in the crimes was stolen leading the police to place factories in the area with stocks of sulfuric acid under surveillance the suspect appeared at a plating factory in horsham and a struggle ensued
[163:00.92]Haw lost his balance and fell from a platform into a vat of acid, ironically meeting the same end as his victims.
[163:09.44]Strangely enough, months later, he returned with white face paint and clown makeup on, leaving cards out of a deck and calling himself the Yoker.
[163:32.98]The corpse, it looks like it's been burned by something.
[163:35.40]Alright, let's put the teddy bear.
[163:37.77]Film has been ripped out of the camera.
[163:39.73]If I had some film, maybe I could purge the spirits.
[163:44.33]Didn't I just say I took it?
[163:48.19]Oh.
[163:53.30]So what about the teddy bear?
[163:54.36]Put the teddy bear down?
[163:57.46]It's a burnt teddy bear.
[163:59.26]No use for it.
[164:02.19]Now it's fatal frame.
[164:03.59]Yeah.
[164:04.87]Get the fuck away from me.
[164:05.95]Why are you in here?
[164:08.16]Power is off.
[164:08.84]Probably best not to open that.
[164:12.54]Is anything else here?
[164:13.24]The washing up is piled in the sink.
[164:17.84]Scary ghost.
[164:25.24]I gotta complete that pendant outside.
[164:27.02]Right here.
[164:33.19]Half pendant.
[164:33.87]Use item.
[164:40.03]Thank you.
[164:42.97]Thanks a lot, Spyro.
[164:45.79]I'll teach you a new special move.
[164:47.59]I've never played that game.
[164:48.61]I don't know what that means.
[164:55.40]That's it?
[164:55.96]That's all I get for that invisibility ban?
[164:57.60]Are you kidding me?
[165:07.25]Shit.
[165:12.85]You need to put these ghosts in the rumble.
[165:16.05]Why?
[165:20.77]Well, let's keep going.
[165:21.77]This car... What's in the back of the trunk?
[165:24.33]The inside of the car is scorched and blackened.
[165:26.67]A crushed box in the boot.
[165:28.61]Was it a present being delivered?
[165:31.57]Teddy bear.
[165:32.73]Come on.
[165:34.50]Yep.
[165:43.65]Cool.
[165:44.45]Now you'll leave me the hell alone.
[165:45.37]There's a sigil stone.
[165:50.13]Pretty good.
[165:52.31]Rest in peace.
[165:56.07]Now the question is... What the hell am I supposed to do?
[166:00.93]The door won't open even when it's pushed.
[166:02.27]It won't budge.
[166:05.35]Don't kill the ghosts?
[166:06.11]I'm not killing the ghosts.
[166:07.22]I'm setting them free.
[166:13.42]Did I miss anything else back here?
[166:16.06]I got the pendants.
[166:17.48]What else do I have for items?
[166:21.04]I got, like, a key.
[166:21.88]I got the kitchen key.
[166:22.80]I was in the kitchen.
[166:23.50]I still don't know what the hell to do with this.
[166:35.33]Let me just take a quick gander this way.
[166:40.37]Go down?
[166:41.91]Nope.
[166:50.99]Please, God, next.
[166:52.23]Please, God, next.
[166:55.71]Not yet.
[166:57.71]Not yet.
[166:58.11]I need film for that camera.
[167:10.10]Where did I go?
[167:14.80]I didn't examine any of this shit.
[167:15.94]Hold on.
[167:19.16]No, I'm missing something.
[167:20.58]There was something I didn't explore.
[167:21.78]I didn't see.
[167:23.50]A bed?
[167:25.40]Sleep in the bed.
[167:27.72]The vase is facing north.
[167:29.90]That's how you go down.
[167:31.53]This, I have the box here.
[167:33.29]I need a tool kit.
[167:35.53]I need a tool key.
[167:39.87]No, nothing in any of these.
[167:42.51]I need a key to this shed box.
[167:46.44]Use your bow and arrow.
[167:47.90]Why did I just fucking listen to that one person?
[167:50.60]I just pressed triangle.
[167:51.48]Triangle's the bow and arrow.
[167:52.52]Why did I listen to you?
[167:53.82]Why did I just look and press the button?
[167:59.04]Let's go back out here.
[167:59.77]Are we down?
[168:09.23]Jump with the ghost.
[168:14.65]Here's this lady down here again.
[168:18.72]I can't go in there.
[168:19.50]This is locked, it won't open.
[168:23.58]The picture frame needs to be changed.
[168:27.95]I can't move it.
[168:28.63]What about the dude that was walking around here?
[168:35.90]Shit.
[168:42.26]Fire extinguisher.
[168:43.24]Can I use a fire extinguisher for something?
[168:49.31]Use the- I did use the kitchen key already.
[168:51.83]You just- it kind of- it's just a way to get out.
[168:53.41]I think I missed something else though.
[168:56.32]The fireplace has a lan- now this is- I am- I'm in the kitchen right now.
[169:01.30]I'm in the kitchen.
[169:02.56]This is the kitchen.
[169:05.89]No, it's not.
[169:06.35]The kitchen's upstairs.
[169:14.95]No, this is the way to go down, and then the kitchen... Was that the kitchen?
[169:24.56]No, nobody has a fireplace in their kitchen.
[169:30.71]Let's look at the map.
[169:36.27]Where's the kitchen?
[169:39.52]So, where... I'm right there.
[169:44.17]I have no fucking idea.
[169:45.03]Out in the back around the corner?
[169:50.75]There's something to do with the fireplace.
[169:51.93]Something to do with the picture on the wall.
[169:54.11]Something to do... There's no way I can get out of this way, right?
[170:02.73]I can't leave.
[170:04.41]So I gotta figure out what to do here.
[170:06.29]There's no way out.
[170:08.83]There's kitchen, which is here.
[170:10.58]I opened that kitchen door.
[170:15.98]This is the kitchen.
[170:18.73]Now, what's in this kitchen that's worth me looking at?
[170:23.51]Rubbish bin, there's nothing in there.
[170:25.89]Boxes, nothing over there.
[170:27.87]Power's off, nothing there.
[170:29.03]This is the film camera.
[170:33.64]Film camera, nothing I can do about the film camera.
[170:38.94]Nothing.
[170:40.16]Dining table.
[170:42.14]Light switch.
[170:45.21]I can go out.
[170:50.91]What do I do?
[170:54.36]Shit.
[171:02.30]Clover of Love.
[171:03.24]I don't think- I don't know what this does.
[171:12.03]Go back to the main hall.
[171:13.57]I guess I could just teleport back to where I was, right?
[171:15.95]Maybe I have to- Maybe I do just have to leave.
[171:21.99]I feel like I've gone through all the options.
[171:27.21]Let's just activate the portal again.
[171:28.45]Oh my fucking... Really?
[171:30.03]Come on.
[171:32.26]I just had to walk back here?
[171:33.46]Huh?
[171:45.67]She should have just
[171:56.95]I would have loved that.
[171:57.65]Can you drop something, Mom?
[172:05.55]Dick's Desk Key!
[172:07.32]Well, now we do have to go back.
[172:08.44]Thanks, Mom.
[172:09.88]We have to talk about Large Marge.
[172:16.50]One of the best characters ever made.
[172:21.10]It's unfortunate that Large Marge never got her own TV show.
[172:25.41]Her own spin-off.
[172:35.82]No, I'm gonna fill it up again.
[172:37.36]Just in case I need it.
[172:38.00]Might as well save the game too, why not.
[172:52.27]Tell him Large Marge sent ya!
[172:56.65]Okay.
[173:17.90]PeeWee made another, like, Netflix special, right?
[173:21.04]And they CGI'd his face to make him not look 68 years old.
[173:24.08]Imagine how painstaking that would be.
[173:29.61]To frame-by-frame CGI a guy's face to make him look 20, 30 years younger.
[173:35.61]Piano's playing again.
[173:36.37]Alright, so... He'll be bashing on the door?
[173:48.21]I got the key.
[173:49.09]This is actually kind of nerve-wracking.
[173:50.13]I don't want to go out there.
[173:55.87]Hello?
[173:59.09]No scary people, right?
[174:00.91]Uh-oh.
[174:05.87]I gotta go downstairs.
[174:07.05]Get out of my way.
[174:23.56]Friends reboot with CGI.
[174:25.50]Oh, I gotta get back to the stairs.
[174:31.68]Friends reboot.
[174:34.62]None of them are even that old.
[174:35.89]Why would you have to do a reboot like that?
[174:38.13]Where the hell am I going?
[174:42.03]CGI frame by frame to make it a good show.
[174:48.79]Can you imagine having to do that shit?
[174:52.76]They were, what, seven friends?
[174:55.36]And they're all on screen in the same time?
[174:57.18]You have to do seven CGI frame-by-frame face manipulations.
[175:01.24]Per second.
[175:02.06]Per 60 frames a second.
[175:03.56]60 frame manipulations on, like, the wrinkles on Jennifer Aniston's head.
[175:10.82]And what was the other guy's name?
[175:12.14]Uh, we got Ross Perot.
[175:21.93]That's 720 face manipulations.
[175:28.07]Even if you had 60 people, if you had 100 people on staff, that would take them all day to do one frame of CGI, make them young again friends.
[175:44.57]That's a full-time job for like 200 people.
[175:55.03]Alright, we're gonna go to Dad's, uh, Dad's inventory, whatever it is, down here, right?
[176:08.10]So no one told you life was gonna be this way You wanna go for broke And ride that fucking wave It's like you're always stuck in second gear
[176:26.62]If it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year.
[176:33.66]Ow!
[176:34.32]Ian, put the dick in the key.
[176:35.54]Put the key in the dick.
[176:36.76]Whatever it's called.
[176:41.99]Book of Entities 2.
[176:43.45]In order to defeat a subordinate, the murdered soul which acts as its energy source must be healed.
[176:49.56]To investigate the healing process, a sentimental item belonging to that person must be obtained.
[176:56.30]If and when this item has been found, the Rudder power is boosted temporarily.
[177:02.84]When we find that Rudder, we'll find the portal square.
[177:06.42]It appears.
[177:12.77]What do I do?
[177:17.53]The person must be a two-foot thief.
[177:19.07]But I'm just... It's happening again.
[177:23.59]Must be obtained.
[177:24.23]And when the item has been found, the root of power is boosted!
[177:31.20]And there's... Oh, Grandpa was the guy in the mask.
[177:37.38]The guy in the beginning of the game.
[177:42.03]Nothing else?
[177:46.09]Put it on the other side.
[177:47.01]I knew it.
[177:48.93]An order form from the camera shop.
[177:51.37]Somebody bought lots of film.
[177:52.63]Do you own it?
[177:55.86]Uh, well, if only Grandfather were here, I could ask him what happened.
[178:05.32]Oh, the mask, the god, the mask.
[178:07.63]Put it up here.
[178:15.96]Look at that one in the top left.
[178:20.03]Now we got the secret laboratory.
[178:24.23]What's up here?
[178:24.95]Grandfather.
[178:26.61]Mummy.
[178:27.09]Look at all these old photos.
[178:33.28]No, there's a spike over there.
[178:38.22]Repellent arrow.
[178:39.08]I got the special arrow.
[178:41.19]Doesn't this thing only use it for special occasions?
[178:44.86]There's probably film right here.
[178:45.80]Yes, of course there is.
[178:48.62]That's film.
[178:49.20]Give it to me.
[178:52.82]Give it to me!
[178:53.50]It's right in front of me!
[178:57.10]Come on.
[178:57.88]What are you doing?
[179:06.65]Camera film.
[179:07.21]Now we just have to go back and put it in the camera.
[179:11.77]Is that Grandfather's writing?
[179:17.13]1978, February 2nd.
[179:17.61]My wife, Francesca, was a Ruda.
[179:36.14]This is the Kingdom Hearts 3 scenario, right?
[180:02.92]Kingdom Hearts 1 comes out, Kingdom Hearts 2 comes out, and then the story just goes fucking crazy.
[180:08.00]And they have to tie up a million loose ends.
[180:10.36]Clock Tower 1.
[180:13.64]You were just scared getting chased by a guy.
[180:17.42]The powers then gradually... Why do we have to progressively get fucking weirder?
[180:20.54]...disappearing entirely by the age of 20.
[180:23.80]Generations of women of the Hamilton clan have spent their teens fighting against subordinates for the Ruder cause, before marrying in their 20s in order to produce the next generation of Ruders.
[180:37.77]Nancy is already 18, and her Ruder powers are dwindling rapidly, and it is almost time for her to pass the job on to the next people.
[180:48.22]We Hamiltons think of our Rudder blood as something of which to be proud, as well as a responsibility that must be taken very seriously.
[180:57.60]I am sad to give my beloved Nancy to another man, but it must be done.
[181:03.36]I will watch her marry with a broken heart.
[181:09.26]Another Rudder has been born to the Hamilton household, my first grandchild.
[181:15.04]I chose for her the name Alyssa.
[181:17.59]She is bright and lively, perhaps even a little strong-willed, and yet appears somehow wise beyond her age.
[181:26.26]I pray she will grow strong and healthy and will fulfill her obligation as a noble Ruda.
[181:34.50]Sorry, Grandpa.
[181:35.18]I don't think I want to do that.
[181:36.50]I'm going home.
[181:41.42]A Ruda family.
[181:43.78]That's me.
[181:44.76]So I am a Ruda.
[181:48.27]Maybe you should stop not being such a panicking little wuss when a guy with a sledgehammer shows up.
[181:59.42]You're a goddamn rooter.
[182:00.56]Start acting like one.
[182:03.66]Maybe I shouldn't be flapping my fucking arms around like a seagull when somebody scares me.
[182:10.52]I have magical powers.
[182:24.64]You're a ruder.
[182:26.62]You're a ruder.
[182:33.42]A ruder always pays his debts.
[182:36.45]That was bad.
[182:36.95]Alright, what do you want me to do now?
[182:39.99]Yes, I know that I'm a magical person and I have magical powers.
[182:42.73]I have a magical bow.
[182:50.55]Now I gotta go take the film?
[182:51.85]Yeah, let's go deliver the film.
[183:02.21]Out, save, up.
[183:05.35]You've been on this game for three hours?
[183:06.81]I'm interested.
[183:07.37]Well, not anymore, but I was.
[183:10.99]Up until we got to the plot of 48% of every animated show.
[183:17.43]It was interesting.
[183:19.17]Probably more than that.
[183:27.76]Jerma, there's nothing to be interested about.
[183:29.38]Flush it.
[183:31.93]I can't yet.
[183:32.57]Not yet.
[183:33.01]Wait.
[183:33.91]Once we put the film in the canister.
[183:37.09]That is my, like, last will and testament as a rooter.
[183:51.18]How much did I spend on this one?
[183:52.36]Was this $200?
[183:52.70]No, this wasn't $200.
[183:54.26]This one doesn't have a price tag on it.
[183:59.72]I don't know.
[184:06.93]Why did I just walk right into that?
[184:08.21]Yeah, I'm not done yet.
[184:22.30]Into the secret room.
[184:24.76]Splash the water on the thing.
[184:26.27]Go deliver the mail.
[184:29.33]And let's get out of here.
[184:38.82]I was supposed to play a 12-hour game.
[184:41.82]Yeah.
[184:43.60]But that's... That's the whole routine, though.
[184:46.26]You know what I mean?
[184:47.70]I can't start the 12-hour game now.
[184:50.34]That, like, there's... I'm not gonna do that now.
[184:53.38]That has to be its own specific day.
[184:56.58]It's gonna mess with my routine.
[185:07.51]We were promised 12 hours of Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[185:12.71]And the game is probably terrible.
[185:18.76]It's not like Simpsons Hit and Run.
[185:21.70]But that's a game that I wanted to beat, even though I hated every second of it.
[185:25.58]It still was an enjoyable sort of experience, kind of.
[185:36.68]Alright, let's put the film in the canister.
[185:42.38]Can you get away from me?
[185:46.54]Use the film.
[185:50.94]There we go.
[185:51.64]Now you'll leave me alone.
[185:52.56]I have some photos here.
[185:59.72]First photo!
[186:04.59]Okay, somebody dumping a body in the dumpster.
[186:09.30]Who took this photo?
[186:11.74]You can't really see the suspect in it.
[186:13.30]I wonder if the person who took the photograph ended up a victim as well.
[186:18.23]Let's check the other one.
[186:23.93]It's a photograph of an open door with a hidden switch.
[186:26.83]It's the painting.
[186:28.93]Is that one of the doors in this house?
[186:31.36]Yes.
[186:34.68]So the painting is the hidden switch.
[186:36.50]Just go move the painting.
[186:41.70]Okay.
[186:47.82]I would have done that earlier.
[186:50.79]No, it's down here, right?
[186:54.01]When do we actually get to the clock tower?
[186:57.13]I don't think we do.
[187:00.91]Must be around here.
[187:04.66]What a hidden switch.
[187:13.41]The clock tower is just the name of the series, guys.
[187:15.29]There doesn't have to be a clock tower in every clock tower game.
[187:32.56]Yes, it has to.
[187:36.80]How come there's no Silent Hill in Silent Hill?
[187:39.92]Yeah, Silent Hill, with the first game, was about like a misty, silent, weird transmission radio frequency mountain.
[187:49.68]Second, third one, fourth one didn't even have a hill in it.
[187:52.13]The fourth one, you were stuck in a room in an apartment.
[187:55.19]There was no hill there.
[187:56.93]It was just a metaphor for the game.
[187:58.87]It was the game's name.
[188:02.98]Give it a rest.
[188:03.73]Uh, I don't...
[188:20.65]I told you that you don't need to be worried about me.
[188:31.26]Your old mother may have dicky eyes, but she's not in her last legs yet.
[188:37.36]You just concentrate on your work.
[188:39.58]Anyway, what is it you're making this time?
[188:42.82]Some new toy that'll have the local kids a gog, I bet.
[188:46.02]Actually, I've been busy making this.
[188:51.52]Albert, what's this?
[188:54.04]Winter's coming, and I don't want you catching cold, wandering around outside.
[188:58.12]I've been making this in my spare time.
[189:00.04]How is it, warm enough?
[189:04.15]It's lovely.
[189:05.19]So warm and soft.
[189:08.03]Thank you.
[189:09.39]Thank you so much.
[189:12.55]That's enough playing happy families!
[189:15.86]You make me sick!
[189:26.87]What?
[189:27.03]What is happening?
[189:27.85]What?
[189:32.80]Why is this guy in here?
[189:33.78]Why is this, like, exterminator in here?
[189:48.92]Look, you're not gonna dump him in the acid.
[189:55.52]You're not gonna... You're not... Jesus Christ!
[190:22.50]That was fucking terrible.
[190:31.69]Why is it so much terrible as shit?
[190:34.39]Face sprays.
[190:35.29]What is this?
[190:37.19]Is this acid?
[190:38.09]Ass fight fire with fire.
[190:40.91]Throw it in his face.
[190:56.35]There was stuff in there.
[191:03.41]Yeah, I don't believe it.
[191:06.35]You want the battery, I said, yeah.
[191:12.66]That guy was just on bath salts.
[191:18.60]That wasn't even like a mur... I like... Alright, is that Dorothy's shawl?
[191:25.44]How do I get that?
[191:34.65]Turn off the fan?
[191:37.33]That was fucked up.
[191:37.93]That was fucked up.
[191:39.01]It was... I don't even know what to say about it.
[191:43.49]If I could turn the bolt if I had the knight tools.
[191:47.15]The knight tools.
[191:54.85]That's not even that funny.
[192:02.28]I didn't laugh at it!
[192:03.66]It's shocking!
[192:06.96]I told you this game's not funny!
[192:09.16]The presentation is insane!
[192:22.63]No, goddammit!
[192:27.67]We all laughed at it.
[192:39.92]Unfunny.
[192:40.40]You can't laugh at a comedy game.
[192:41.92]It's not a comedy game!
[192:44.26]I need to find a way.
[192:50.61]He's already down here.
[192:51.41]What am I doing in the bathroom?
[192:55.41]Oh, great.
[192:57.27]Can I flush myself down the toilet?
[192:58.79]Is this like... What's that... What's that movie?
[193:03.67]Get out of here!
[193:07.17]I'm trying to use... No, that's not even funny.
[193:26.97]You tell me I can't laugh.
[193:28.59]No laughing, right?
[193:29.97]You can't laugh at the fucking Bugs Bunny cartoon Daffy Duck guy got hit with the door routine.
[193:35.75]And I'm not allowed to laugh at this game?
[193:38.99]Are you just... really?
[193:41.99]Give me a little bit of a slack here.
[193:51.97]Alright, what do I need?
[193:53.25]Was there anything in this room?
[193:54.99]There was like something on the ground in here, right?
[194:04.11]Invisibility band, okay.
[194:10.85]Alright, where do I go now?
[194:16.39]Five minutes, no laughing challenge again.
[194:18.43]No, I can't do that shit.
[194:26.57]Maybe I should try the other door?
[194:29.21]This is where he came from, right?
[194:38.16]There's something else in here, maybe.
[194:46.14]Something else here?
[194:48.06]A key!
[194:48.62]Okay.
[194:50.14]Toolbox.
[194:50.81]There it is.
[194:53.25]There's the toolbox key.
[194:54.60]Now, I'm just trying to remember where that toolbox was.
[194:59.80]Back track to the toolbox.
[195:06.00]There he is again.
[195:10.96]I hear him.
[195:11.56]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[195:14.11]The toolbox was in... It was down in the original of that house.
[195:19.85]Jesus!
[195:20.31]What the fuck?! !
[195:23.00]He's much faster than the other guy.
[195:27.20]Burns him.
[195:29.76]Alright.
[195:32.88]Leave.
[195:36.44]Is this the way out?
[195:40.14]It is.
[195:40.36]Okay.
[195:40.74]Toolbox is in... Where the hell is it?
[195:46.62]Whoa!
[195:58.62]What the hell is he doing right here?
[196:01.30]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[196:04.66]Go!
[196:04.98]Toolbox.
[196:05.46]Open it.
[196:06.20]It is a... It's a knight tool.
[196:08.18]Okay.
[196:08.42]Back.
[196:08.58]Down.
[196:38.09]out and then back through the picture frame.
[196:51.50]Where are you?
[196:52.04]Where are you?
[196:52.50]Where are you?
[196:53.04]Where are you?
[196:54.38]Where are you?
[196:55.62]Camera.
[196:57.34]Where are you?
[196:59.20]Who are you?
[197:01.00]What are you doing?
[197:06.11]At the time I realized something that was wrong.
[197:09.23]The entire place was infested with zombies.
[197:18.54]He's too fat to go through the chimney.
[197:21.92]He is.
[197:30.22]Play the Resident Evil 2 DLCs.
[197:33.32]I mean, that is my current game of the year, and I can't believe I've only played through one time.
[197:38.66]How could I say something like that?
[197:40.04]How could I say that Resident Evil 2 is my favorite experience of the year without... But where are you, though?
[197:48.02]I knew it.
[197:48.94]That's not fair that you came through that way.
[197:50.84]Because... Come on.
[198:06.68]Where's the remix in this song?
[198:12.27]I'd love to hear it.
[198:22.43]He's right behind me.
[198:24.40]Crawl through now?
[198:28.08]If Vanna stopped, I should be able to get through.
[198:31.40]Get fucking destroyed.
[198:34.44]Idiot.
[198:51.53]He somehow got over it.
[198:53.97]I didn't even- seriously, yikesies.
[199:00.99]I'm dead.
[199:02.85]Not yet.
[199:04.11]I'm invisible.
[199:05.69]I can't see.
[199:28.40]What the fuck are you doing here?
[199:29.44]What?
[199:29.62]What's wrong with you?
[199:35.19]That ghost just snapped my back in half.
[199:46.99]Well... That's the first time a ghost has done that to me.
[200:03.22]Let me get to the end of this section here.
[200:08.99]Is there anything here I can do?
[200:14.33]I guess I have to keep moving, I think.
[200:20.26]No button I can press, no activation.
[200:21.96]Just go through.
[200:31.66]Watch out for this ghost.
[200:34.64]Steal door.
[200:37.83]I can't hide in that.
[200:38.83]Why?
[200:40.09]Why can't I not hide in there?
[200:41.97]There's a save point right there.
[200:43.47]Wait a minute, what's this?
[200:45.53]Electrocute him.
[201:04.02]Does this guy have a name too?
[201:05.06]Is he a serial killer?
[201:08.92]John the Scorcher or something?
[201:14.45]Lavender water.
[201:15.07]There's a note on the table.
[201:25.30]Daughter's letter.
[201:27.70]Daughter's letter.
[201:34.01]I don't feel comfortable saving it when he's on the ground in the room.
[201:44.79]Oh, it's John Ha, okay.
[201:47.73]That makes sense.
[201:55.52]Alright, now at least I have a second to take a look at anything in this room.
[202:00.74]He's gonna get up any second though.
[202:04.05]Nothing else in here at all.
[202:05.99]Nothing.
[202:07.13]Cable is sitting in the puddle.
[202:08.78]That is just asking for electrocution.
[202:11.94]Why don't I just go stand in it?
[202:13.44]Okay, let's get out of this.
[202:18.28]I did pick up a new letter.
[202:23.54]Letter from a girl to her father must have been read many times.
[202:28.30]Okay, what keys?
[202:34.39]No, I just have that letter.
[202:35.45]I wonder what I'd do with it.
[202:48.00]Well, you're here again.
[202:49.66]Across the way, maybe?
[202:55.64]It's been locked me to the side.
[202:57.42]Oh.
[203:04.90]Not exactly what I wanted to do.
[203:10.81]Maybe a secret back here?
[203:20.49]Jerma's stocks are tanking.
[203:21.77]Please make a joke.
[203:25.67]Uh, it's alright.
[203:26.23]There's gonna be a correction at some point.
[203:28.01]There has to be.
[203:31.81]Which one is the correct one?
[203:32.63]There's two boards!
[203:33.86]Probably this one.
[203:41.49]Time to play the guessing game.
[203:42.47]Which one's gonna break?
[203:43.31]I think I guessed right.
[203:50.13]Get off of it.
[203:50.79]It's gonna break!
[203:51.23]Oh, it was scripted.
[203:55.17]It's scripted, it's scripted.
[203:57.20]Don't worry.
[204:08.85]Is he in the water?
[204:10.61]No.
[204:11.39]The gas mask guy was gonna be in the water.
[204:20.68]Wait.
[204:22.02]Did I not get it?
[204:24.94]Maybe that wasn't scripted.
[204:38.89]So is it every Roblox obstacle course?
[204:44.78]Do people really, do people play Roblox?
[204:46.96]Is it a game that people actually play?
[204:58.83]Oh, there he is.
[204:59.43]A constant reminder of the guy, the guy that did it before you.
[205:07.41]I actually did guess it right the first time.
[205:14.82]It's free and it's good.
[205:18.02]No, it's not that I forgot.
[205:18.82]I just... I was trying to make sure... Trying to clarify that that was correct.
[205:28.47]So Roblox is a combination of... It's like... Isn't it like Gary's mod for kids?
[205:38.43]It's like Minecraft, Garry's Mod, and LEGOs all came together.
[205:44.00]Right?
[205:50.10]You can make your own video games and stuff.
[205:51.76]Alright, here we go.
[205:55.78]Gotta just go across fast.
[206:00.78]Got it.
[206:01.56]Alright, so I picked up their... the shawl.
[206:09.38]This is it.
[206:10.72]This must be Dorothy's shop.
[206:14.20]It is.
[206:14.96]What do I do with Dorothy?
[206:16.19]Do I put it in the, like, acid?
[206:22.41]What do I do?
[206:36.84]Uh...
[206:39.32]I found you!
[207:11.69]Why is my meter not going down?
[207:21.81]My heart is gonna beat out of my chest.
[207:25.72]Um, he's not even here!
[207:27.14]Meter!
[207:27.42]I don't have to take a potion, come on!
[207:34.80]Oh, it's just a crouch.
[207:48.79]You can hear him breathing.
[207:51.11]Well, where is he?
[208:00.32]Can you beat the game quicker?
[208:02.72]I don't know if there is a beat the game quicker.
[208:18.37]Haha, funny Jerma.
[208:19.35]What are you talking about?
[208:20.31]I didn't do anything.
[208:22.37]I'm not making any joke references.
[208:24.33]That was him right there.
[208:27.72]Did he just show up in the corner up there in the top right?
[208:30.52]He did, didn't he?
[208:32.10]I just saw his acid spray.
[208:59.84]Fuck you.
[209:01.15]It was this lady.
[209:02.21]It wasn't even him.
[209:03.35]Do I have to electrocute him again?
[209:10.41]Let's zap him again.
[209:12.11]Uh oh.
[209:28.30]Okay, so what did I do?
[209:30.08]I got the shawl, so I need to go up back into... Where do I bring the shawl?
[209:34.07]I don't know where the shawl is supposed to go.
[209:39.41]Three hours of the same chase music.
[209:57.68]Well, I think I figured it out.
[209:58.90]Just walk back.
[209:59.62]You see, I've been waiting.
[210:02.20]You think I'll let you interfere?
[210:04.84]You can't beat me.
[210:06.12]I'll destroy you.
[210:07.04]I'm a ruja!
[210:07.64]Get out of your lip, little girl.
[210:09.22]You have your own destiny to accept.
[210:11.28]My destiny?
[210:12.34]You must die!
[210:14.02]That was pretty quick.
[210:17.88]But wait!
[210:20.78]What?
[210:45.12]The power is granted to you, young Alyssa.
[210:53.88]Azaruda.
[210:54.81]Let's see how many years in prison this guy had.
[210:59.71]Corrodo.
[211:01.75]Victims 31.
[211:02.23]Sentenced to 605 years in prison.
[211:03.74]Begin!
[211:04.14]There she is!
[211:04.76]Prepare to die!
[211:27.11]I'm gonna wait till he stops moving.
[211:29.03]Bait it.
[211:30.57]And... that hit me from that far away.
[211:34.51]Unbelievable.
[211:37.19]Oh, he actually has a projectile.
[211:41.60]I get it.
[211:43.44]Now I'm gonna detach him here.
[211:52.88]One, two, three, four, five!
[212:02.39]There she is!
[212:04.95]Damn it, I thought I could get away from it.
[212:07.89]There she is!
[212:10.52]Fuck, that has a huge hitbox of shit!
[212:19.58]There she is!
[212:22.23]Prepare to die!
[212:26.53]That didn't attach?
[212:28.69]What game are you playing?
[212:41.13]Come on, get the projectile.
[212:48.48]Three.
[212:49.46]Four.
[212:49.88]Five.

[212:59.61]Four.
[213:00.15]Five.
[213:01.69]Got it.
[213:02.33]It's time for you to die.
[213:04.21]What do you do?
[213:04.69]How did you get out of that?
[213:12.64]I thought it's three and then you can do the magic move, right?
[213:25.09]Dammit!
[213:31.31]There she is!
[213:35.82]There she is!
[213:41.42]The pet should die!
[213:51.25]Nope.
[213:51.65]Shoot me.

[213:58.23]Nope.
[214:00.69]Dammit!
[214:01.27]One, two, three, four, five.
[214:04.97]Did I get it?
[214:05.99]There she is!
[214:07.55]No.
[214:08.89]Prepare to die!
[214:22.86]There she is!
[214:43.93]Prepare to die!
[214:50.75]Okay, we got one.
[214:54.55]Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!
[215:08.38]It's hard because he's using his moves.
[215:22.64]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay!
[215:24.74]Back up!
[215:26.34]Two!
[215:29.86]What the fuck?

[215:44.92]Oh, you suck.
[215:46.04]Mmm...
[215:53.80]Try aiming.
[215:54.32]There is no aiming.
[215:59.31]I cannot move this around.
[216:04.13]There is no aiming.
[216:05.55]I just have to dive into the exact spot.
[216:13.56]Motherfucker, I had it too.
[216:20.85]This should take two fucking...
[216:25.60]What's the- what's my special arrow?
[216:27.28]I have a special arrow, don't I?
[216:33.52]That shit takes too long.
[216:34.70]That's like six goddamn seconds.
[216:36.08]One.
[216:36.54]Two.
[216:36.82]Three.
[216:37.02]Four.
[216:39.02]Fi- There she is!
[217:17.08]too many years.

[217:21.42]There she is.
[217:26.51]There she is.
[217:27.43]Prepare to die.
[217:46.32]So when he says, damn it, that's when you gotta do it.
[217:52.93]I might get him.
[217:57.01]There's one.
[218:00.65]No!
[218:00.81]No, no, damn it, no!
[218:04.27]Come on, stay there, you son of a bitch!
[218:09.27]Back off, back off, back off!
[218:17.52]How do I shoot the special one?
[218:33.11]How many times do I need before I get the R1?
[218:36.71]That's a good question.
[218:38.93]That's right.
[218:41.41]There she is!
[218:43.12]Oh!
[218:43.90]Prepare to die!
[218:54.56]This is... this is stupid.

[219:33.66]Three!
[219:34.52]Do it!
[219:39.48]Why couldn't I do it?
[219:40.16]R1 didn't do anything.
[219:41.87]R1!
[219:44.67]I can't do it!
[219:45.51]R1!
[219:47.23]R1!
[219:48.11]What the fuck was that?
[219:49.71]R1!
[219:56.47]There she is!
[219:57.58]You need more than three?
[220:01.84]Prepare to die!
[220:03.68]You need six?
[220:17.03]No.
[220:22.62]Didn't I do it with three last time?
[220:30.73]full charge when he has enough tethers yeah and four no you 100 need six tutorial said six six I have one special arrow but it's like the repellent arrow right
[220:59.40]Just out of range.
[221:00.12]I'm gonna get it.
[221:04.02]Right after the other.
[221:08.99]Come on.
[221:16.56]Three.
[221:17.32]Don't.
[221:17.60]Don't do it.
[221:20.90]It's three, according to the wiki.
[221:22.14]I got three on him right now!
[221:29.08]There she is!
[221:31.72]Prepare to die!
[221:34.31]It's three according to the wiki.
[221:36.09]What am I having to do?
[221:41.47]Let me see what happens when I do this.
[221:48.50]I can't even cancel this.
[221:51.40]What does this do?
[222:04.01]The tutorial said you needed them fanned out.
[222:08.59]Yeah, so that's what I thought.
[222:09.73]Like, you do one in each corner and then... Where is the manual?
[222:16.62]Did I always connect up the manual?
[222:21.20]That's what I was thinking too.
[222:25.66]Somebody said that I didn't have to do that though.
[222:27.54]They were like, yeah, there's one there.
[222:30.16]Now there's like one over here, right?
[222:32.06]In each corner.
[222:37.35]Over here?
[222:50.21]He's tethered now, right?
[222:51.75]R1.
[222:53.51]Fully charged.
[222:54.29]R1.
[222:54.95]R1.
[222:55.67]R1.
[222:55.89]He's got four on him.
[222:58.43]R1.
[222:59.95]This dude's literally covered in fucking air.
[223:04.53]R1.
[223:04.57]Game over.
[223:04.91]I win.
[223:06.81]It is our one You have to do... it had to be four on it It's the Wiki Live Somebody edit that page and make sure it's correct
[223:35.61]It must be the amount of years, maybe something like that.
[223:43.85]This is stupid!
[223:52.12]He dropped... what did you drop?
[223:53.30]A crystallized... what is it?
[223:56.50]Clover of Courage.
[223:57.44]I have two of these now.
[223:58.18]I have the Triforce of Wisdom, the Triforce of Courage.
[224:03.02]Did you drop anything else?
[224:16.31]I don't think so.
[224:17.43]Now we have to return the shawl and see the cutscene of them floating up, right?
[224:26.60]The second gem for the gauntlet.
[224:32.64]Now it's time to quit the game.
[224:38.38]How do I get out of here?
[224:39.12]Do I have to climb back through?
[224:40.74]I guess so.
[224:52.72]We are now too invested.
[224:54.50]It has to be finished.
[224:58.14]I don't know if I can do that.
[225:00.51]Finish it.
[225:01.01]You might as well just beat it.
[225:09.40]Floygan Brothers are right.
[225:10.54]I don't even have the Dreamcast hooked up.
[225:22.04]Cutscene or something?
[225:22.80]That's a really weird angle.
[225:30.04]Oh.
[225:32.77]Uh.
[225:35.65]No.
[225:39.11]Floygenrucker.
[225:41.17]Are they in here?
[225:43.73]Where were they s- where did he dump them?
[225:46.33]Like, there?
[225:49.98]Where do I return the shawl to?
[225:54.48]Not sure.
[225:55.00]In the kitchen?
[225:59.26]Was there another level down here?
[226:03.46]You'd think it'd be right here.
[226:06.24]Is this pre-recorded?
[226:07.00]He's not talking to us.
[226:08.16]I've been... What?
[226:08.97]We've been talking the whole time!
[226:10.03]It was one of the barrels, yeah.
[226:12.85]Maybe I just have to go back, or something?
[226:25.21]Isn't this barrel?
[226:34.74]What the heck?
[226:38.14]Use?
[226:38.40]Maybe, yeah.
[226:39.00]Hold on.
[226:41.39]Can I use the shawl?
[226:46.71]I don't think... I think it's just a random key item.
[226:54.19]Hand-knitted shawl.
[226:55.87]Must give it to Dorothy.
[227:01.38]Wait, maybe back down?
[227:02.80]Okay, hold on.
[227:03.36]Wouldn't she in... Oh, the... Okay, no, no, no.
[227:05.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[227:07.22]The room that was... The Merlin room.
[227:11.34]I gotta go back down and out of here.
[227:12.67]Back into the house.
[227:28.72]Does Jerma make chat messages up to respond to in order to make jokes?
[227:34.14]I don't think so.
[227:39.22]Make up chat messages?
[227:41.65]Oh, that was a really good one from MrSteven22.
[227:45.45]Alright, we should get a cutscene in here.
[227:59.75]Because this is the room that she was in.
[228:01.35]Yeah, here we go.
[228:03.61]Here's your shawl.
[228:15.20]I can see.
[228:17.09]I can see.
[228:19.15]Albert?
[228:20.79]Albert?
[228:22.49]What about Albert?
[228:23.01]We don't have an item for Albert.
[228:24.51]I waited so long for you.
[228:31.24]Remember this.
[228:32.76]It's the winter show you knitted for me.
[228:34.53]Mother, I can see.
[228:39.57]I can see, too.
[228:46.64]There we go.
[228:50.56]Thank you, Melissa.
[228:53.96]Thank you very much.
[228:56.80]Dorothy, Albert, goodbye.
[229:05.43]Somebody said they're being abducted by aliens.
[229:08.69]Easy.
[229:11.69]Yeah, Jane.
[229:12.32]It's me, Grandpa.
[229:12.96]We have to run away from him now?
[229:42.18]This game is an emotional rollercoaster.
[229:43.74]That's what I was saying.
[229:45.64]I can't help it if I have an outburst every now and then, because the game is out of control.
[230:06.80]Oh no, not Thunder 2!
[230:09.32]I only know Thunder 1!
[230:15.46]Uh, here's the clock tower.
[230:19.19]Took him three and a half hours, uh, four hours of the game before we got to see it.
[231:02.71]What is this song?
[231:07.09]Ugh.
[231:22.97]Those two spirits were what was stopping the clock tower from being rebuilt and now the two of the spirits are dead.
[231:27.94]He's strong enough now.
[231:29.14]This is no longer your home.
[231:31.16]This is the dark realm where I rule.
[231:34.34]It's clown music.
[231:36.93]And your 15th birthday will arrive.
[231:40.77]When that happens, you and I will become one.
[231:43.85]And together we will obtain eternal life.
[231:47.72]My 15th birthday?
[231:49.90]Are you looking forward to it?
[231:51.30]So am I, my dear.
[231:52.82]So am I. I can't wait.
[231:54.96]Soon we two will be united forever.
[231:58.04]Alyssa, you might have defeated two of our number, but your mother was killed by a subordinate long ago.
[232:05.19]No!
[232:06.01]You're lying!
[232:06.99]She can't!
[232:07.51]If you don't believe me, you can go to hell and see for yourself!
[232:12.70]No!
[232:26.42]The dramatic spinning is a little too much for me.
[232:43.77]How is she fine?
[232:44.37]Did she just float down?
[232:51.14]Uh... Well...
[232:55.43]Let me go take one more pee break, and we're going to find out what we're going to do.
[233:01.02]I'll be right back.
[236:21.62]Hello.
[236:28.14]Mic not muted?
[236:28.72]That's whatever, that's fine.
[236:32.80]We both, Etalyx and I both took a break at the exact same time somehow.
[236:39.32]And we just did a unpause.
[236:47.31]Did you pee together?
[236:48.39]No.
[236:54.62]Alright, so, here's the question I have.
[236:59.58]How much is left?
[237:02.24]Does anybody have any idea?
[237:03.34]12, huh?
[237:13.31]Time to beat Clock Tower 3.
[237:18.76]How long is Clock Tower 3?
[237:27.33]Five and a half hours to beat the whole thing.
[237:31.25]I'm like six hours or so more to beat the whole thing.
[237:36.03]Halfway through it.
[237:36.75]It's like five, it's like five and a half to eight hours.
[237:45.28]Damn it.
[237:48.24]Damn it.
[237:51.28]If there was like another hour and a half,
[237:58.46]Do it.
[238:00.00]You sound mad.
[238:02.88]Snap the disk in half.
[238:04.44]No.
[238:05.22]Let me just... I want to see what's... Let me see what's out here.
[238:11.79]Let's just see what's outside.
[238:13.37]You know?
[238:14.25]I'm not gonna keep... I'm not gonna keep... I'm not gonna beat it.
[238:16.45]I'm just gonna see.
[238:26.03]Well, that's lavender water.
[238:31.41]Do face game for this?
[238:32.36]I can't, I don't have any clothes on.
[238:40.60]I don't- I don't- Okay, look.
[238:42.92]I can tell you that this game sucks.
[238:45.18]Right?
[238:45.40]And you probably all be like, yeah, yeah, it sucks.
[238:48.01]But... Hold on.
[238:48.83]No?
[238:58.54]He ran into his house without closing.
[239:01.58]Um, yes.
[239:03.73]I don't wear shirts.
[239:05.27]He already knows this.
[239:06.25]He's very... He was very much aware of it already.
[239:15.47]Uh, but no, but this is... I'm, like, having fun.
[239:17.55]The light is filtering through.
[239:18.59]I can crawl through here.
[239:21.84]These PS2 streams were never meant to... Oh, you know what?
[239:24.44]I'm gonna play this one for six hours.
[239:31.18]But, I don't know.
[239:32.66]Sometimes it just kind of happens, right?
[239:37.40]Lantern has been left behind.
[239:38.30]Was someone here?
[239:41.53]Another ghost.
[239:47.11]Hit and run was 12 hours.
[239:49.89]Yeah, I don't know.
[239:50.44]Maybe...
[239:54.26]I'm just gonna keep going until I kinda don't care anymore.
[239:56.78]And maybe that'll be another 10 minutes, maybe that'll be another hour.
[239:59.30]I don't know.
[240:00.54]I still have a lot of other things over here to check out.
[240:04.14]But this has been very interesting and fun.
[240:07.40]I'm at chapter 3 out of 5, so I'm at the halfway point.
[240:09.71]Okay.
[240:17.13]Put the drill away.
[240:26.84]It's locked.
[240:27.32]I have to find the key.
[240:31.11]I just want to see the new scary man.
[240:34.21]What's the new scary thing?
[240:36.15]The new weirdo.
[240:36.77]If you consider playing Alan Wake, I've already played Alan Wake.
[240:42.99]Unfortunately, I've already seen it.
[240:46.55]I have never beaten Alan Wake, but I did get to the final chapter in the game.
[240:50.19]That's a lock.
[240:56.50]Bubbles?
[240:56.82]Are we ever going to see the egg again?
[241:04.34]I don't know.
[241:06.64]That's a good question.
[241:08.34]I'm not going to rule it out.
[241:23.42]The egg is the next boss.
[241:26.30]Really?
[241:27.94]Worker's key that opens the door back there.
[241:32.69]Fish.
[241:34.15]Eel?
[241:35.17]There's an electric eel.
[241:42.63]What the fuck?
[241:43.49]Just no!
[241:44.31]Why?
[241:44.95]What?
[241:46.17]Oh god damn it.
[241:47.45]Are you kidding me?
[241:58.17]How is that even possible?
[241:59.35]Now I wish the webcam was on.
[242:01.45]Hold on.
[242:28.02]So, I picked up my drink.
[242:30.28]I just have a glass.
[242:33.52]There's coffee in it, right?
[242:36.46]And I don't know what happened.
[242:39.16]I moved it like too fast and it like shot up out of the glass like T-Rex style and got all over my mic.
[242:47.96]Like splashed into my mic.
[242:52.44]I don't know how that happened.
[243:23.21]That was so dumb.
[243:26.19]That was seriously a physics puzzle.
[243:29.66]Picked up the glass and moved it towards my mouth and must have shimmied a little.
[243:34.66]Oh my god.
[243:43.04]Now it's gonna stink like fucking coffee in here.
[243:45.43]Can't wait.
[243:48.25]I bought sippy cups too for this very fucking reason.
[243:50.33]I haven't even used them because I'm too embarrassed.
[243:53.28]I have to use them.
[244:00.95]Your voice sounds so much more rich and full-bodied now.
[244:08.60]Well, actually, I didn't buy the sippy cups, you guys did.
[244:11.18]Well, no, I did.
[244:12.60]But you guys made me buy them.
[244:14.94]Right?
[244:16.04]Yes, that's what happened.
[244:26.66]Let's see who it is.
[244:29.78]This guy's fast.
[244:31.92]It's Kratos!
[245:04.11]Can I steam him?
[245:06.25]You can't get away!
[245:11.66]Splash!
[245:12.52]Splash him!
[245:13.50]What are you doing, girl?
[245:14.58]I'm dead.
[245:27.11]You can't get away!
[245:28.95]Splash him with your stuff!
[245:32.27]Oh, fucking dead!
[245:34.95]Please don't!
[245:38.51]I was trying to splash, but you can't splash when you're panicking, apparently.
[245:49.67]Wow, you suck.
[245:50.47]No!
[245:50.83]I didn't- I'm trying to splash him to stop him.
[246:02.40]This streamer has a very dicky brain.
[246:06.50]This guy sucks.
[246:07.96]This guy fucking sucks.
[246:15.88]Forget about the fish.
[246:16.76]Alright, work is key.
[246:21.18]Forget about it.
[246:21.73]I mean, I could throw the... Just... There's a door on the other side here.
[246:26.85]Here he comes.
[246:37.87]What?
[246:38.15]Does it not work on this guy?
[246:40.97]Is he just a human?
[246:48.22]Fish tank.
[246:48.70]Am I in the fish tank?
[247:08.49]Oh, nice trick.
[247:10.63]Alright, we're good.
[247:14.62]Thank you, fish.
[247:15.20]Appreciate it.
[247:17.22]There's a butthead left.
[247:18.14]Alright, let me wait till my sanity comes back.
[247:28.08]Nice trick.
[247:34.65]This guy's just Twitch chat.
[247:35.95]And that initial, like,
[247:40.60]Alright, let's go.
[247:53.54]I don't know why I just thought of, in Donkey Kong Country, every boss.
[247:59.75]When you- OH I DID IT!
[248:26.93]Anyways, never mind.
[248:29.07]He's back.
[248:31.89]Oh, nice trick.
[248:33.17]Oh, nice trick.
[248:36.53]Please just get out of here.
[248:40.75]Oh, nice trick.
[248:41.59]I didn't even know he could do that.
[248:54.51]so okay in donkey kong country every boss when you hit them you do like a dodge roll thing you jump on their head they do that that's what it reminds me of Sans no no
[249:23.60]That's every boss.
[249:33.02]Okay.
[249:33.30]Are you gonna come through the door again, or can I just leave?
[249:36.06]Alright, go through the worker's door.
[249:47.40]Use the worker's key.
[249:49.20]Yes.
[249:53.85]He's gonna show up right here, isn't he?
[249:56.47]He's gonna be on the ceiling or something.
[249:58.84]Yep.
[249:59.22]Yep.
[250:00.48]Yep.
[250:00.92]Yep.
[250:02.04]Yep.
[250:04.76]B3.
[250:06.42]Go in.
[250:06.70]I don't know.
[250:07.10]I don't know.
[250:07.98]Touch it.
[250:08.60]Go.
[250:09.06]Uh, B2.
[250:09.44]Sounds like patches.
[250:14.65]Yeah, it kind of does.
[250:25.12]B2.
[250:27.22]Basement 2.
[250:31.90]This guy has no backstory.
[250:33.18]There's no... What the hell?
[250:34.62]How'd you even get behind me?
[250:38.99]That was so not cool.
[250:44.89]Oh, nice trick.
[251:06.77]This game is so fucking dumb.
[251:09.98]But it's not about it, it's just fun.
[251:14.08]Nice trick.
[251:16.54]So, there's a box here.
[251:19.50]With a crowbar.
[251:24.10]I'll take it.
[251:32.30]So I have a crowbar now.
[251:33.42]Was there something I could do with this?
[251:39.60]Ain't that a sub sound?
[251:41.56]No!
[251:46.42]I guess we're gonna go back up.
[251:51.26]So we're gonna go to B1, I guess.
[251:56.18]We need a new one.
[251:57.26]We have to rip it from here somehow.
[252:05.53]Does this first floor be one?
[252:06.63]This is where I was before.
[252:12.91]But wait, there might be something I can do with this.
[252:17.71]This idiot came.
[252:19.29]Okay.
[252:20.89]Check down here.
[252:24.99]Oh, we need to do this again.
[252:34.40]Gloves?
[252:35.86]Okay, you got the rubber gloves.
[252:45.10]He's getting close!
[252:48.12]A circuit breaker?
[252:48.76]The power's been turned off.
[252:50.54]Turn it on.
[252:52.26]Doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[252:55.36]Well, maybe he can stop dancing.
[252:59.14]Alright, I have rubber gloves and a crowbar.
[253:03.59]He's fast.
[253:07.05]He's fast!
[253:10.21]Don't come in here with me.
[253:11.23]Close the door.
[253:11.73]Close, close, close.
[253:12.11]Be free.
[253:28.94]He doesn't need to get in the elevator, he just shows up.
[253:31.48]Alright, so I have gloves and a crowbar.
[253:38.11]Of course, he just spun.
[253:39.77]This guy sucks.
[253:42.55]I hate this guy.
[253:45.37]Anything else I need to do?
[253:47.19]I need to save point right now.
[253:50.29]And I'm panicking again.
[253:53.76]I haven't saved it in a while.
[253:54.82]I might take the invisibility thing.
[254:01.36]No!
[254:03.52]I'm gonna do it.
[254:06.23]No, I'm not.
[254:07.13]I'm good.
[254:11.15]Ah, there's an item over there.
[254:18.49]What the fuck?
[254:19.07]Is that a gun?
[254:19.80]There's something inside the wooden box.
[254:25.07]Distribution plan.
[254:26.29]B1, B2, B3, A1, A2, A3.
[254:29.63]So you can get to A2 from B1.
[254:33.82]B2, you can get to A3.
[254:35.58]Is this a puzzle?
[254:38.68]I don't... Ah, this is bad.
[254:48.43]It works now.
[254:49.47]Didn't work last time.
[254:59.62]Nothing else here.
[255:00.32]I got a lot of random items that I'm not sure what to do with.
[255:03.98]Wow, why are you so fast?
[255:09.54]Come on.
[255:13.79]Nope.
[255:28.65]Can you please stop falling and moving in random directions?
[255:47.78]That truly was a nice trick.
[255:50.00]Back to B?
[255:50.92]No, B2.
[255:58.18]Item B2.
[255:58.80]I'm going to hang out in here for a second, though.
[256:04.98]I want this to go down, because he'll... This is not going to go down.
[256:12.05]I mean, I'm pretty hidden.
[256:13.21]That's annoying that it's not going down.
[256:18.79]Go down.
[256:19.13]What are you waiting for?
[256:21.15]Go down.
[256:24.44]I can hear him running.
[256:26.67]Alright, where's this item?
[256:32.42]Item.
[256:32.76]He just handled me in the head.
[256:36.40]Did you actually just hit me with that?
[256:41.71]Fuck.
[256:56.86]Wrong floor!
[256:57.66]Move!
[257:02.16]Now, look at that hitbox!
[257:03.86]Give me a break!
[257:04.89]Oh, nice trick!
[257:05.89]Yeah!
[257:12.13]V, what floor was it?
[257:13.99]Will you stop this nonsense?
[257:18.28]Oh my god.
[257:18.98]This is the wrong floor.
[257:22.34]There's B1.
[257:32.42]Nonsense.
[257:33.10]Look at my meter here.
[257:37.66]I gotta take another one of those potions.
[257:41.70]Gotta use it somewhere.
[257:42.58]Okay, B1.
[257:49.97]Somebody said there's an item somewhere that I missed?
[257:58.71]It's to the right of the elevator.
[258:01.14]That was to the, that was to the elevator's right.
[258:02.98]That was to the right of the elevator.
[258:05.70]Goddammit, you meant literal, like my, like, I don't... Like the right of the, like the elevator right.
[258:12.71]I can't even get this.
[258:13.51]Just invisible.
[258:19.84]Oh, oh, nice trick.
[258:34.21]It's just an invisibility fan!
[258:38.61]It's not even an item!
[258:42.27]Let me look at my items.
[258:48.74]Thick rubber workman's gloves, useful for electrical work.
[258:53.36]Standish a crowbar, looks as if it may be useful at some point.
[258:55.86]So I have gloves?
[259:03.84]I'm gonna have to... Okay, I'm gonna go back.
[259:07.16]There's probably something there.
[259:09.18]Where is he?
[259:09.52]I have to walk right by him.
[259:11.48]I'm gonna have to lose this fucking guy.
[259:19.76]The electronic door lock.
[259:21.10]The power indicator lamp is off.
[259:24.14]Oh god, I'm gonna lose.
[259:25.26]Do I have to put the gloves on or what?
[259:29.09]Dude, go to the breaker!
[259:32.22]No, no, no, no, no!
[259:33.78]Duck!
[259:50.36]Okay.
[259:51.44]So, crowbar, electrical gloves.
[260:01.06]I did duck.
[260:01.58]I tried.
[260:02.10]What is this breaker?
[260:08.04]Is it down here?
[260:13.80]There it is.
[260:15.83]Alright.
[260:17.63]Oh, shit.
[260:19.01]You made an electrical cable.
[260:23.31]Rubber gloves might help you use them.

[260:28.91]Alright, so who's...

[260:34.47]I can't look at it.
[260:37.17]He's like... I need to... I need to look at the map.
[260:40.57]I can't look at the map.
[260:41.43]I kept hit cancel.
[260:42.07]And he's gonna be right here.
[260:48.10]Not my map, my inventory.
[260:55.22]Files.

[261:20.63]Just, okay, bottom, bottom left middle, bottom middle right, bottom right left.
[261:28.61]So it just goes two bottoms of one, two, three.
[261:32.50]So it goes two, three, one.
[261:39.26]Two, three, one.
[261:47.52]Two.
[261:47.72]So I want to move this one.
[261:50.39]So two to the middle.
[261:57.73]Okay, it's doing top to bottom.
[261:59.03]Fuck.
[261:59.25]I was doing bottom to top.
[262:04.74]So two.
[262:06.48]Okay, so we're going to go middle.
[262:09.12]Middle.
[262:11.44]Left.
[262:13.58]And then we're going to do...
[262:17.34]Right to the middle.
[262:19.28]And then we'll do left to the right.
[262:25.88]Now we'll do the breaker.
[262:30.16]Is there a switch down here?
[262:36.53]What's that switch?
[262:39.21]No, it's not.
[262:46.09]Get up!
[262:46.61]Why does it take you so long?
[262:55.48]No, where's the staircase?
[262:56.48]Get up the staircase.
[262:57.18]Don't go panicking yet.
[262:58.76]I hate you.
[263:01.58]I have to take the invisibility thing.
[263:02.84]So I can have the shit and not panic.
[263:17.21]I can't.
[263:19.39]Please just get in there.
[263:20.71]Please just get in there.
[263:22.41]Open the door.
[263:22.91]Just be ready.
[263:23.57]Open it.
[263:23.87]Go in.
[263:25.67]Okay.
[263:26.21]B. B. B. B. Gotcha.
[263:29.41]Why can't I touch it?
[263:34.55]He's not gonna come in here, right?
[263:38.70]Stop panicking.
[263:58.17]Really?
[263:58.87]Why am I still panicking?
[264:09.10]I'm never gonna get out of this.
[264:11.14]He's right there.
[264:26.27]N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-
[264:47.11]I need to turn on the power, and then where the hell am I?
[264:49.97]I gotta go back up, and then... Fuck, man.
[264:53.71]I'm gonna have to do this whole thing again just to get it right.
[264:56.95]What was the last save point?
[264:58.51]I don't have a save point.
[265:03.04]Fuck.
[265:11.96]Turn it on.
[265:15.16]Where's the power?
[265:17.34]Fuck!
[265:18.80]No, where's the power?
[265:19.74]What did I do wrong?
[265:20.96]Oh, I did the power and I shot him on this level!
[265:28.68]I'm dead.
[265:30.38]Wrong floor.
[265:30.94]Everybody said B2!
[265:32.19]There was at least 10 B2s!
[265:34.69]Oh, no!
[265:35.41]Ah!
[265:44.79]Well, now I know.
[265:53.19]Use the holy... Actually, I should get a good continue here.
[265:56.85]Use the holy water.
[265:57.67]I know, but my brain, the first time it didn't work, and now my brain thinks it's not going to work.
[266:05.23]B2.
[266:05.75]Oh, bad.
[266:18.85]That's a long... that's a very long segment.
[266:33.25]It's a long-ass segment with no saves or anything.
[266:40.36]But now I know, like, kind of what to do.
[266:42.84]So I have to get the gloves.
[266:43.86]I gotta just kind of wrap around.
[266:45.36]I'm not gonna use that unless I need it.
[266:47.60]Okay, I need gloves.
[266:52.12]So let me, like, put this into memory forever.
[266:56.49]Okay, here they are.
[266:58.87]Here we go.
[266:59.47]I might have to get this to open the box.
[267:08.66]This...
[267:14.81]Okay, let's stop him.
[267:19.91]So, okay, I can remember this level.
[267:26.00]This is, what, which B is this?
[267:31.28]You asshole, you need one.
[267:33.29]This is B3.
[267:34.25]This is not B1.
[267:36.03]We're gonna go to B2?
[267:38.97]So B3 has the console.
[267:47.54]Yeah, B3 has box.
[267:49.27]B2 has... ...some other shit.
[268:05.15]What does B2 have?
[268:07.09]B2 has the... Watch out putties!
[268:18.17]That's the crowbar.
[268:20.54]I'm not going to use this yet.
[268:22.36]Until I need it.
[268:27.58]I'm trying to do this, bro.
[268:30.16]This girl is so fucking awkward.
[268:31.62]Like, really?
[268:32.81]Come on.
[268:34.05]I have three of them.
[268:38.67]I don't want to use it right now, though.
[268:43.97]Two has dog shit.
[268:44.85]There's nothing here.
[268:54.45]B1.
[268:59.25]You can't blame a 14 year old girl for falling over when hit by an axe.
[269:15.26]Where is he?
[269:15.58]I don't think he spawns until you take a step out there.
[269:26.16]I'm gonna sit here for as long as it's necessary.
[269:33.05]He doesn't spawn until you take a step.
[269:34.35]Out.
[270:02.74]I'm not stalling.
[270:03.80]I'm trying to make it so I don't have to use a potion.
[270:09.68]Stalling or trying to play correctly.
[270:12.06]Which one?
[270:19.57]Alright.
[270:20.79]Let's keep going.
[270:22.87]I need the gloves and then B3.
[270:27.47]Here he comes.
[270:29.19]See?
[270:29.59]Told you.
[270:31.45]Fuck off.
[270:33.37]This guy needs to fuck off.
[270:40.18]B3 is boxed.
[270:44.12]Anything else over here?
[270:47.02]Just need to check and make sure I don't miss anything.
[270:48.54]There could be something over here.
[270:50.52]There we are.
[270:51.18]Okay, okay, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[270:53.34]Uh, what'd I have to say about that?
[270:54.76]Yep.
[270:56.36]If you could just stand up.
[270:58.26]Can you?
[270:59.26]Okay.
[271:07.75]So this is B1.
[271:11.51]So we're gonna go B3, box, B1.
[271:13.92]Oh, come on.
[271:24.26]Stop panicking!
[271:25.82]Stop panicking!
[271:28.30]Don't do it again.
[271:29.06]He's just gonna panic again.
[271:35.86]Why is the door closed?
[271:46.15]Come on!
[271:46.95]I wasted so many items there for no reason.
[271:51.59]B3.
[272:02.31]We are on B1.
[272:03.55]B3.
[272:03.93]Do the box.
[272:04.45]B1.
[272:04.97]Power.
[272:19.96]Somebody just wrote B2.
[272:20.70]Get the fuck out of here with that.
[272:22.88]Oh, you sure it's on B2?
[272:25.20]B3 box.
[272:37.13]Here we go.
[272:38.95]So it is... uh... remember this... No, I fucking forget it.
[273:00.69]Okay, then it's... left... left into middle.
[273:03.51]So middle into left.
[273:07.00]and then right into this.
[273:11.80]Okay, B1.
[273:12.40]Go.
[273:12.58]Go ahead and give him a chance.
[273:17.56]B1.
[273:34.85]What a dummy, dumb, dumb, dummy.
[273:38.53]Oh, this is Dan from the next room over.
[273:41.95]Can you shut the fuck up for two minutes?
[273:43.15]It's almost 2am and I can still hear you.
[273:44.63]I had a hard day doing real work for 13 hours.
[273:47.95]And I just want a little bit of peace and quiet.
[273:49.98]Oh, just kidding.
[273:50.56]It's Tanner from high school again.
[273:51.78]Enjoy playing your kids' games.
[273:58.86]That just threw me off.
[273:59.54]I don't know what I'm doing.
[274:00.32]Oh, yeah.
[274:00.58]Okay.
[274:00.80]Power.
[274:00.94]Power.
[274:11.82]On the way down.
[274:16.68]Okay.
[274:17.10]Flip the switch.
[274:18.58]Now I have to go back to the keycard reader, which is where I don't have a... I think the power is flowing.
[274:27.57]He's gonna get...
[274:49.49]This girl.
[274:50.47]This fucking girl.
[274:55.35]Same floor?
[274:56.03]I need chat to confirm that for me right now.
[275:04.03]Same floor.
[275:13.42]It worked.
[275:13.96]I think the power is flowing.
[275:15.60]Yeah, so go!
[275:17.57]So open the door!
[275:25.99]Uh oh.
[275:39.46]Where's the keycard?
[276:16.63]Maybe I don't have to activate something here?
[276:19.42]Maybe I have to do the thing where I burn him.
[276:24.80]Nothing else in here.
[276:27.98]I guess I should activate this.
[276:29.34]Oh, nice trick!
[276:31.61]We know how this ends.
[276:48.73]How would I live through this?
[276:55.25]So, I have an opportunity just to not have to worry about him now.
[277:00.18]My question is, is there anything else in B2 that I can even do?
[277:04.18]I need a keycard, which I don't have.
[277:06.06]I have a crowbar.
[277:07.06]Does he have a card?
[277:13.96]He doesn't have a card.
[277:14.91]Maybe I have to go back and use the crowbar upstairs somewhere.
[277:25.13]Nothing else in the boxes.
[277:31.52]Nothing, right?
[277:34.84]No, I'm just gonna go back.
[277:35.88]I'm just gonna get the hell out of here.
[277:47.61]Save, save, I'm dying.
[277:48.55]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[277:57.69]Where do I go from here?
[278:08.57]Can I leave?
[278:09.23]I don't think I can get out of here.
[278:13.75]How do I get out of here?
[278:34.70]Is this the way out?
[278:35.89]This is the way out, right?
[278:39.09]Yeah, yeah!
[278:40.67]Yeah!
[278:42.97]Yeah.
[278:45.13]Okay.
[278:46.93]Let's save the game.
[278:51.95]Back to the fish tank.
[278:52.81]Crowbar may be somewhere.
[278:57.34]Refill the holy water.
[278:59.76]Okay, nice.
[279:09.26]You're doing a great job.
[279:10.24]Keep up the good work.
[279:10.88]Hey, thanks.
[279:12.82]Thank you.
[279:13.20]Alright.
[279:23.06]So I have a crowbar.
[279:25.40]Can I use the crowbar on the fish?
[279:29.76]No.
[279:38.74]I don't think there's nothing in here I can do.
[279:40.74]Maybe in a different direction?
[279:41.72]Go the other way?
[279:42.92]Oh, really?
[279:43.70]Like... Where would I use a crowbar?
[279:46.26]Crowbar.
[280:00.96]Pro Bar?
[280:01.30]This looks like something I can fuck with.
[280:03.26]I'll need... I'll never be able to lift that lid.
[280:05.32]Yes, I will.
[280:06.48]There's no handle open, so I can't get back.
[280:09.02]Excuse me, I have Pro Bar.
[280:23.19]What?
[280:28.97]Pro...
[280:31.83]Use the crowbar and I can go down?
[280:34.47]Wow!
[280:36.22]Yes, please!
[280:41.52]Poor guy.
[280:47.09]What do you have?
[280:49.55]What is that doing here?
[280:51.15]Couldn't have been locked in here.
[280:52.85]It's holding a note.
[280:53.67]A message is scratched on the paper.
[280:59.11]How many days have passed since he locked me up in here?
[281:01.43]I can barely write anymore.
[281:03.35]I came in to rescue you, but now I have too been made a prisoner.
[281:06.83]I've been broken my promise to protect you.
[281:09.61]Soon I'll be unable to even record these feeble thoughts.
[281:12.77]I have lost the spectacles which you gave me.
[281:16.07]Is it too much to ask for any remnant of you in my last hours?
[281:23.09]That's pretty terrible.
[281:25.74]But what, you got a pocket knife there?
[281:27.68]Swiss Army knife?
[281:30.50]Empty spectacle case.
[281:31.48]I need to find the guy's glasses.
[281:34.64]Right?
[281:37.93]Here they are!
[281:41.65]They were right in front of you the whole time, man.
[281:45.69]I got it.
[281:46.19]I got it.
[281:46.77]I have your glasses.
[281:48.73]Look!
[281:49.23]I'm trying to put them in there!
[281:51.63]Do you not see me with them in my hand?
[282:04.95]What was he si- Rest in peace.
[282:09.97]What were you- what egg were you sitting on?
[282:11.39]Is it about to hatch?
[282:13.99]Keycard.
[282:15.50]There it is.
[282:19.76]Progress.
[282:20.28]So that was B1, right?
[282:38.39]Is he gonna be sitting right in front of me?
[282:43.09]Save the game?
[282:46.40]Just predict him.
[282:50.12]I'm gonna hide though, hold on.
[282:57.31]Oh, nice trick!
[282:58.19]He's not gonna die, right?
[283:06.43]Oh, nice trick!
[283:10.71]You want him to teleport.
[283:11.73]Because he can come right back in.
[283:18.28]Even when the music stopped.
[283:24.24]Music.
[283:26.44]Music stopped.
[283:28.74]Save it.
[283:29.54]Holy water.
[283:30.48]Refill.
[283:34.05]Save the game.
[283:34.61]Nice.
[283:51.11]I just have a short question for you I know you're streaming so I'll keep the question fast and simple I don't want to be a bother although the larger spectrum of things this is time is quite minimal universe took 13.7 billion years to form after earlier I offer you uh 30 seconds of human communication regardless thanks for answering ahead of time what are you talking about maybe one day I can ask a more in-depth personal human question can we be friends I don't these don't make any sense
[284:26.62]Copy positive.
[284:32.70]60,000 years ago, a guy wrote the Bible.
[284:34.84]You know what we're gonna leave behind?
[284:37.03]Hey, it's Jeff from Psychology 101.
[284:40.69]That's gonna be our generation's Bible.
[284:58.30]I hope so.
[285:04.26]It's been five hours and I've been driving in circles for five hours.
[285:14.46]God.
[285:15.74]This is the same guy.
[285:33.17]Here he is.
[285:33.57]He's here.
[285:35.84]Car key.
[285:39.68]Inside, super special arrow.
[285:44.42]You got a repellent arrow.
[285:49.65]And a holy water refill.
[285:52.31]And a save point.
[285:56.29]And...
[286:05.22]Oh, super special.
[286:07.62]And the end of the fucking game.
[286:08.76]Not yet.
[286:13.00]Oh, Mosquito.
[286:13.52]Speaking of Mosquitoes, I have to get Mr. Mosquito.
[286:16.51]It's another game that I have.
[286:17.45]I don't have it.
[286:18.71]Liar.
[286:19.81]But I'm gonna get it.
[286:22.85]It's so dusty, nobody has used it in a while.
[286:28.17]Did I miss something?
[286:29.77]It's so dusty, nobody has used it in a while.
[286:35.39]That's another expensive one, though.
[286:37.93]I feel like this is the boss fight.
[286:39.87]They did just give us a repellent arrow.
[286:42.21]That's one of the bunnies from Castle Griffinsteed.
[286:46.77]So it's kind of odd to see that here.
[286:48.08]That's actually pretty terrifying.
[286:50.64]Brand new toy railway.
[286:51.76]I can't be the one I was given when I was a child.
[287:01.38]Where did I just end up?
[287:04.06]Mom gave me that statue.
[287:05.24]It should be in my room.
[287:06.22]Why is it here?
[287:08.85]Nothing of interest here.
[287:09.65]It's locked.
[287:21.01]Don't Max Payne me here, please.
[287:22.47]Not yet.
[287:37.29]I can't get it, it's locked.
[287:38.19]Hmm, Nancy, what is Mom's name doing there?
[287:41.09]This is the same... It's the same audio file.
[288:07.77]Alright.
[288:08.99]Fine baby.
[288:10.08]The baby's probably gonna be me.
[288:11.12]And I'm gonna watch the Harry Potter sequence, where I get the scar.
[288:37.30]That baby sure did figure out how to talk and sing very quickly.
[288:51.25]Mom?
[288:53.05]Is that you?
[288:55.03]Where are you?
[288:59.27]We're going to get into the Merlin room.
[289:00.71]The whole thing's going to swirl around.
[289:01.77]Alyssa, my sweet baby.
[289:11.59]This necklace has been handed down in the Hamilton family for generations.
[289:18.17]There are four leaves.
[289:20.78]One each for love, friendship, hope, and courage.
[289:27.10]I need the other one.
[289:28.26]I must get piece number three.
[289:29.40]These four leaves together lead the wearer to true happiness.
[289:36.14]I'll give it to you, Elisa, when you're older.
[289:45.29]Isn't friendship just weaker love?
[289:46.99]That should be a half piece.
[289:48.11]Going over the edge.
[290:26.78]Why did Nancy have to marry a man like you?
[290:30.16]A man with no spine, no spirit.
[290:33.43]Axe turning.
[290:35.67]It's not funny.
[290:53.08]Here we go.
[290:54.04]Boss fight!
[290:55.04]I don't even know this guy's name.
[290:57.02]It's time.
[291:21.02]You know, if I was smarter and more prepared, I would have already queued up, like, the Sailor Moon transformation song.
[291:29.53]I've just been playing it right now.
[291:30.95]Just imagine I did that.
[291:31.81]Just you do it.
[291:32.29]So this is the... We're almost done with the game.
[291:51.16]Here we go.
[291:52.54]Chopper.
[291:55.46]44 victims.
[291:57.36]How many years in prison?
[291:58.66]921 years sentenced.
[292:00.24]Your health bar is enormous.
[292:06.63]Judgment begin.
[292:11.95]I didn't lock him.
[292:16.63]What did we not lock him for?
[292:49.73]One, two, three, four, five, six!
[292:53.79]This is the last one!
[292:56.54]This guy sucks.
[293:18.73]The other guy was way harder.
[293:22.47]Oh, wait.
[293:24.09]She's unkillable.
[293:24.91]My magical bow!
[293:27.53]No!
[293:47.22]That was weird.
[293:50.26]We didn't get the piece.
[294:03.33]Just an excuse to reuse him in the next chapter.
[294:07.03]That's probably what it is.
[294:08.79]You'd be correct, I would assume.
[294:21.47]Hey, nice trick, devs.
[294:22.88]Is this the scroll that I just picked up?
[294:34.88]1998, May 12th.
[294:36.20]My sweet Alyssa.
[294:37.98]My sweet Alyssa.
[294:39.67]You do it.
[294:39.91]Your small hands have grasped my heart and will not let go.
[294:45.09]But to think that the father of my beautiful granddaughter is Philip.
[294:49.58]is more than I can bear.
[294:51.86]I consented to the marriage so as to protect the Ruda bloodline.
[294:56.27]I realize now that was a foolish mistake.
[295:00.03]The man lacks class and has not a shred of dignity.
[295:03.61]He loses no opportunity to exhibit his stupidity and weakness of character.
[295:08.50]We Hamiltons have no place for men of that nature.
[295:12.58]Even Nancy has been affected by his rubbish, saying that she does not want to raise Alyssa to be a Ruda.
[295:19.33]Of course, the existence of Aruda is fraught with danger.
[295:23.03]But given the gravity of the situation and the great responsibility of Aruda family, the obligation cannot be shirked.
[295:31.99]Any attempt to avoid such a duty is indeed shameful.
[295:36.56]As long as I am the head of this house, that man will never be accepted as one of us.
[295:45.32]No date.
[295:46.20]Finally, Philip went too far.
[295:50.20]Large gap there.
[295:50.74]There's police in this universe?
[295:51.78]I feel like there isn't.
[296:23.24]Now the cops are involved.
[296:31.43]Yes, my magical Ruder bloodline and monsters and Kratos's.
[296:37.37]And all the fucked up magic that we have in this world.
[296:40.52]Bow and arrows made out of jewels.
[296:44.18]But the police, yeah, just dialed 911 to see if we could get them to come investigate.
[296:54.84]Is this one of those things?
[297:02.01]No.
[297:03.19]What if it's the magical police?
[297:04.61]No, it's not the magical police.
[297:07.83]It's gonna be like the NYPD.
[297:09.97]Anything else in here?
[297:15.12]I guess, I don't know.
[297:19.90]Jeremy, your tea is ready.
[297:35.65]Am I inside the bracelet?
[297:37.61]The necklace?
[297:38.15]There's gonna be four quadrants.
[297:39.71]I have no idea.
[297:55.55]There's one this way, there's one that way.
[298:14.48]This is one of these going back and forth.
[298:17.82]It's this sound in my ear.
[298:19.81]I'm sorry.
[298:22.83]It's causing me so many problems.
[298:28.03]Good thing I found this.
[298:38.48]Shito?
[298:41.14]This is like Shito.
[298:48.82]Prove Shido's alive.
[298:49.92]Prove Shido's alive!
[298:50.96]No, it's fine.
[299:04.39]Boss fight phase two, or what?
[299:18.32]Is this the fucking Belmonts?
[299:23.23]I don't understand.
[299:24.73]Yes, I made a reference to the Castlevania Netflix show.
[299:26.63]It's pretty good.
[299:31.93]I was killed by an entity and have been trapped in the darkness ever since.
[299:36.79]What pain.
[299:38.65]Help.
[299:40.45]Help me.
[299:41.53]It's too dark to see anything.
[299:43.29]Where am I?
[299:44.07]Tell me where I am.
[299:46.19]This game sucks.
[300:34.66]Yes, but it is good because I'm still playing it and I've done to invested so I'm gonna beat it I Gotta be getting close
[300:48.74]I probably only have another 30 or 40 minutes in this game.
[300:51.52]I have to.
[300:55.14]Turn the game volume down?
[300:56.34]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[300:56.76]I'm probably killing everybody.
[301:00.34]What about the letter?
[301:01.36]No.
[301:15.10]I guess we're just going to turn it on.
[301:18.18]So four hours.
[301:24.68]Four hours?
[301:25.30]I don't believe that.
[301:36.58]But for real?
[301:38.00]What, uh... There we go.
[301:40.92]Alright, so now I did turn into one of these.
[301:44.46]Where does this one take me?
[301:53.79]Back to the house, maybe?
[302:00.03]Please change the song.
[302:02.91]This song is still there, I'm sorry.
[302:12.41]Same thing?
[302:14.86]What the hell is that?
[302:16.26]Letters engraved on the wall.
[302:17.40]Read the engraving.
[302:18.74]A curse upon any who would desecrate our sanctuary.
[302:22.10]Only she of ruder blood may heal our wounded spirits.
[302:28.56]Oh, I was trying to hit that, but... Now I can't walk over there.
[302:37.87]Yeah, I can.
[302:47.68]Hello.
[302:55.73]The noise is somehow worse when it is quieter.
[303:00.97]I can't do anything about it.
[303:02.37]I have to hear it too.
[303:08.38]Remove sea rooter stone.
[303:10.92]Is that not desecration?
[303:18.43]C. Rooter.
[303:24.28]Letters are engraved on the wall.
[303:25.40]Read the engraving.
[303:26.56]Tomb of the Rooter Warrior, Protector of the Earth.
[303:29.83]A painting of soldiers riding black horses.
[303:32.77]So I gotta put the Earth cube in here.
[303:35.71]The C cube goes in the other ones.
[303:37.65]This is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[303:47.29]Oh yeah, this is going to be a pain in the ass.
[303:50.98]Is this the C-Cube?
[303:55.34]American Rooter Warrior.
[303:57.30]Okay.
[304:07.85]Rooter Stone cannot be removed.
[304:09.71]Only one may be carried.
[304:13.69]God damn it.
[304:21.00]Tomb of the Rooter Warrior, Captain of the Seas.
[304:25.98]So I have to put this one down and take that one out somewhere else.
[304:30.06]Oh my god.
[304:31.82]Get off me.
[304:33.56]Get off me.
[304:34.10]You'd take that that much panic?
[304:39.35]Use it?
[304:40.17]I can't.
[304:41.45]Use the stone.
[304:42.01]Wait, I thought... Use it, use it, use it, use it, use it, use it, use it, use it.
[304:47.15]What?
[304:48.01]There's already one in there.
[304:57.02]I can't use it.
[305:00.74]Guys.
[305:10.40]Now I've wasted, I've wasted two jiggles of liquid.
[305:18.27]Well, what's down the front hallway?
[305:22.43]Hopefully another one.
[305:23.17]I'm gonna run out of this stuff.
[305:25.86]Okay, what's in here?
[305:27.76]Yep, yep, yep.
[305:28.92]Alright, easy.
[305:32.50]Cannot be removed only one may be carried.
[305:34.24]This is the air.
[305:41.98]So, how the fuck am I supposed to do this?
[305:47.61]If I can only carry one and I can't put it anywhere else...
[305:58.05]What about maybe the other side?
[305:59.49]There's gonna be one that's empty.
[306:13.36]There's only three places, so I'm gonna go to the other side.
[306:23.75]Okay.
[306:24.17]Well, there's the little holding place.
[306:26.65]So now I gotta... Oh, this is a pain.
[306:29.59]Now I gotta go down here.
[306:32.67]Go get the warrior one.
[306:34.53]Go put the warrior one where it belongs.
[306:36.87]Wait, where's the warrior one?
[306:37.95]Where the hell is it?
[306:39.32]Over here?
[306:39.64]I don't know.
[306:45.82]Is this the warrior one or is this the air one?
[306:54.00]Sky router.
[306:55.30]No, I need the warrior one.
[307:05.06]He doesn't remember.
[307:05.98]No, I don't remember.
[307:12.90]Down this one?
[307:13.68]Which hallway was it in?
[307:16.98]No.
[307:25.32]There it is.
[307:28.17]I'll take that, please.
[307:29.09]Earth Rooter.
[307:29.73]Yep.
[307:30.11]And put it over there.
[307:31.05]This game sucks so much.
[307:54.22]This goes in here.
[307:55.46]Get off of me!
[307:58.97]Earth.
[307:59.33]Insert the Earth Rooter Stone.
[308:01.17]Thank you.
[308:01.71]Now that will cleanse your spirit.
[308:09.91]Take this as a token of my gratitude.
[308:12.28]I'm going back to Luigi's Mansion!
[308:14.08]Okay.
[308:16.80]You didn't give me anything?
[308:22.56]So now I gotta get the water one and put it in the straight up there.
[308:29.44]Stolen joke, was it?
[308:30.96]From where?
[308:33.52]Where did I steal that from?
[308:41.12]Oh no, air, air, air.
[308:45.70]Give me air.
[308:50.74]I hit it.
[308:51.24]You saw it.
[308:56.74]You stole it from Luigi.
[309:05.18]Thank you for releasing me from this terrible game.
[309:06.89]I'm now going to go to a better game, Luigi's Mansion.
[309:12.07]I gotta watch out because this thing's gonna kill me.
[309:24.32]Luigi's Mansion was trash.
[309:27.80]Jesus.
[309:31.18]No, I gotta refill.
[309:35.92]Ban that guy.
[309:46.58]Ban that guy.
[309:58.60]I tried!
[309:59.74]Don't panic.
[310:05.41]How do you remove somebody else's sub?
[310:08.39]I'm sorry, you can't.
[310:09.93]It's not something you can do.
[310:16.98]Is there no music in this game or is it muted?
[310:18.46]It's currently muted because it's a piercing ear sound that is at a very high frequency.
[310:26.23]And it's causing people a lot of stress.
[310:37.01]By the way, there are two of these, so I'm gonna have to do this again.
[310:40.94]On the other side.
[310:42.42]Bet you a dollar.
[310:54.38]Double or nothing.
[310:55.56]Double or nothing, yeah?
[311:00.90]Is this the C one?
[311:04.34]Is this the C one?
[311:05.00]This is the C one, right?
[311:07.74]Oh, it's the Earth one.
[311:08.70]Fuck.
[311:13.53]Not like this!
[311:14.47]It's the one on the right.
[311:18.57]There's only three rooms, it shouldn't be that hard to remember.
[311:31.68]The thing is, when I get like bored, I start to not pay attention.
[311:40.22]And I'm sitting here, like, looking at the chat and talking to you guys and hanging out and having a good time, having a fun time, having a good time.
[311:49.62]The world record for this game is an hour and 19 minutes.
[311:54.92]Interesting.
[312:00.62]What is that?
[312:01.79]A disk.
[312:05.27]It's not having a good time if you're bored.
[312:12.32]This is supposed to be... I knew we were going to play this for longer than an hour.
[312:18.59]I knew it.
[312:19.61]And we did.
[312:20.19]And now this whole stream has been Clock Tower 3.
[312:25.43]Tomorrow, we're going to continue playing PlayStation games.
[312:29.30]PlayStation 2.
[312:31.18]Compass of Light.
[312:31.92]Should I just put it in here?
[312:41.47]So we have another side to do.
[312:48.37]One PS2 game at a time.
[312:49.87]That's not usually how it happens, but... The cutscenes in this game, the game mechanics were just... I had to see it through.
[312:58.72]It's just too much.
[312:59.94]Had to do it.
[313:04.90]What's on the other side?
[313:15.94]I knew it.
[313:16.28]We're going to do it again.
[313:16.96]Watch.
[313:17.28]It's going to happen again.
[313:19.22]This time it'll be five rooms instead of three.
[313:30.99]Ready?
[313:38.27]One, two, three, four.
[313:39.59]I see five rooms.
[313:57.08]through the graveyard there's a car here alright music's gone you can't get away uh so you're back now that's it you're just here you don't wanna get away
[314:22.67]Can somebody just snipe him?
[314:23.77]Let's fight this guy again.
[314:26.25]Oh god, again?!
[314:27.13]What?
[314:27.55]No, I'm not f-
[314:52.95]You were right.
[314:54.21]It's Mom's handwriting.
[314:55.67]22 out of 3.
[314:57.99]Two weeks until Alyssa's birthday, I'm so worried that I don't know what to do with myself.
[315:02.27]I sent her to boarding schools that she wouldn't have to fight as a rooter, but will the enemies let Alyssa's heart go so easily?
[315:08.56]They say a rooter heart is necessary in the ritual of engagement.
[315:11.62]A rooter heart.
[315:12.68]Taken from the body of one who has reached her 15th birthday.
[315:16.60]I only hope that she can elude them until her birthday is past.
[315:22.08]Are you done, Raiden?
[315:25.94]Well, here's the thing now.
[315:27.80]Now where do I go?
[315:28.52]Into the shed?
[315:31.00]I already fought this guy.
[315:39.35]Why do I have to fight this guy again?
[315:46.19]Axe?
[315:47.61]Wouldn't want to sleep in that bed.
[315:54.50]Is he not on here?
[315:55.28]Oh, this is a hiding spot.
[315:57.20]Oh, nice trick.
[315:59.14]Why are you screaming?
[316:01.50]I don't even know what the hell I'm supposed to do in here.
[316:18.41]You can't get away.
[316:20.61]There's probably an item in here that I need to get.
[316:25.52]Fighting by a see-through curtain.
[316:30.18]That doesn't work.
[316:32.86]Just bring the whole jar!
[316:35.72]I know, right?
[316:37.32]Mummy, are you really dead?
[316:58.02]No, you asshole game!
[317:01.34]Now I'm gonna go into... My head's gonna start spinning here.
[317:09.65]Why am I going back?
[317:10.43]I'm just trying to get away from this guy, temporarily.
[317:14.21]So I don't panic.
[317:18.62]So now I can just chill and let it dissolve, and then I'm gonna go back in.
[317:29.77]Alright, relax.
[317:34.47]Back to the mosquito music.
[317:52.88]Okay.
[317:53.30]So the... the shed is probably the item on the bed.
[317:59.08]I wonder if he's here, too.
[318:00.20]I don't think he is, though.
[318:05.32]Where can I refill this?
[318:13.77]Is there... No.
[318:14.37]Let's go see what happens when I go down there.
[318:23.42]No, no fountain over here?
[318:35.60]Is there a fountain this way?
[318:36.50]I mean, I could go over here, but I don't have enough to teleport.
[318:40.86]No, I can't even go over here anymore.
[318:42.98]Fountain?
[318:43.50]Fountain.
[318:43.80]No fountain?
[318:44.94]Oh, there's one back here.
[319:09.07]And it's a safe point.
[319:29.15]Abort this game?
[319:30.01]Look, we'll be live tomorrow with more PlayStation 2.
[319:37.35]I'm still getting enjoyment from it.
[319:42.27]So don't worry.
[319:51.18]Four hours out of five.
[319:59.32]Okay, so let me look at the map.
[320:04.94]So I am currently... standing.
[320:09.96]Where the fuck am I standing?
[320:17.01]I just came out of, what, the top left?
[320:30.03]So if I go down... There's a book in there.
[320:35.13]Save point and... Alright, I'm gonna go all the way down.
[320:37.21]Back to the shed.
[320:48.38]Back to the shed.
[320:57.06]Damn it, really, did I miss?
[320:58.62]You can't get away!
[321:00.66]Oh man, these dumb fucking butterflies are all over me now.
[321:08.93]Get off me!
[321:09.55]Get the fuck off me!
[321:13.91]Oh, nice trick.
[321:28.76]Too many squares.
[321:34.46]Bad save point.
[321:36.10]When he comes in the door, I'm gonna splash him.
[321:41.36]Maybe he's not even gonna come in here.
[321:42.22]Alright, I didn't get the chance to look in here.
[321:44.62]So there's... There's a book.
[321:46.78]Alright.
[321:47.40]I had to get this, probably.
[321:48.70]Book of Entities 3.
[321:49.84]No, Dad, I don't want you to read this.
[321:53.00]A woodcutter by the name of Harold was born in Wales.
[321:56.53]Hideously deformed, he suffered taunts.
[321:59.51]At 17, he proposed marriage to Emily Dickens.
[322:03.25]He was rejected in retaliation.
[322:05.29]He said he had... Okay, this is the person we're talking about here.
[322:09.39]For years following the gruesome event, he went from village to village and butchering people.
[322:14.26]Two years later, he was caught by villagers and killed.
[322:16.08]Howell was possessed by an entity and he arrived to hunt.
[322:18.64]And it's this guy.
[322:19.54]Alright, good.

[322:27.18]I'm gonna just hide in here.
[322:28.80]Hide him in the bed.
[322:30.87]I'm gonna wait for that music to stop.
[322:35.55]Let's face when he won't see my message.

[323:48.62]Yeah, the other two circles.
[323:50.74]Fuck it, I'm going to sleep.
[323:52.42]And it is getting fairly late.
[323:54.80]You guys are going to bed.
[323:56.84]Have a great night.
[323:57.90]Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.
[324:08.92]Alright.
[324:11.29]Anything else over here?
[324:16.41]Midnight?
[324:16.77]Well, it's not late really for me.
[324:19.45]But it's almost 3 a.m.
[324:21.41]Eastern.
[324:23.07]That's very late.
[324:26.73]I can understand.
[324:29.17]If you want to skedaddle.
[324:30.25]Statue of a Two-Eyed Lion.
[324:31.84]There is a switch inside its mouth.
[324:37.28]Okay.
[324:39.74]So there's two more switches to press.
[324:47.46]it's 12 eastern what time is it right now it's 9 15. I thought I don't know why I thought it was midnight I thought it was like 12 15. I don't know why it's got so lost there okay there's the one in the middle what about okay let's probably walk
[325:18.31]That one's already been pressed.
[325:24.45]Oh, fuck off.
[325:26.99]Going downstairs is so hard for this girl to do.
[325:29.92]Just go down the stairs.
[325:32.28]Something is written along the outer frame.
[325:34.08]Purify thyself with holy water and awaken the lions in order.
[325:39.18]Awaken the lions in order.
[325:40.58]I hope I did this right.
[325:48.09]It's got three... That one has three on his head.
[325:56.23]I'm going to assume that means that that's the third one to press.
[325:59.10]Let's just see if I... Let's see if it works.
[326:01.02]Does this one have two or one?
[326:03.26]This one's got one damn eye.
[326:05.44]One, two, three.
[326:23.13]What the fuck are you talking about?
[326:28.07]Is it already done?
[326:28.71]Oh, nice trigger!
[326:33.22]Oh, nice trigger!
[326:53.67]Stop panicking.
[326:57.15]You can't get away!
[327:01.45]So Holy Water's gonna reset them then.
[327:04.20]From my understanding.
[327:06.48]Do we have to have this dickhead just following me?
[327:09.52]Nothing happened.
[327:10.22]Alright, so here we go.
[327:12.08]This is two, right?
[327:13.84]This is two.
[327:14.60]I need to do the one on the... That's three.
[327:19.26]So one, two, three.
[327:22.45]I'm gonna run out.
[327:42.94]I mean, wrong one.
[327:43.87]One, two, three.
[327:50.05]I know it's not the one over here.
[327:51.09]I know it's the one in the middle, but I currently have to run away and I'm gonna get hit in the head and I'm gonna lose.
[327:56.22]So I have to take this too.
[328:06.64]You really have to come this way.
[328:07.87]Why would you follow me up here?
[328:08.85]I'm invisible.
[328:10.91]I'm invisible.
[328:19.31]Alright, then three, and then flash the holy water on the damn thing.
[328:29.38]I have to, like, bait this guy around.
[328:30.84]He's gonna block the... He's gonna block my exit.
[328:45.79]He double tapped!
[329:01.08]I love not having control of my damn character.
[329:04.18]It's really fun.
[329:06.65]The Compass of Shadows now.
[329:19.61]No, I have to see this through.
[329:21.30]Alright, so I have the Compass of Shadow.
[329:27.86]So I have two items now.
[329:33.94]Compass of light, compass of shadow.
[329:35.64]I still have these dumb gloves.
[329:43.81]I have to go refill my shit too.
[329:45.41]I gotta move.
[329:53.09]Just get out of my way.
[329:54.45]Fucking come on!
[330:07.77]Get away from me.
[330:09.53]I'm gonna panic.
[330:10.79]No panic.
[330:16.55]Oh, nice trick.
[330:18.71]Oh, nice trick.
[330:24.24]Oh, nice trick.
[330:40.26]If he turns around, I swear to God, he wouldn't even need to teleport out of here.
[330:43.92]Please.
[330:44.80]Thank God.
[330:45.58]Ugh.
[330:48.24]Alright.
[330:50.70]So now that I have the two compasses, I'm gonna save the game.
[331:03.96]And where do I bring the two compasses?
[331:06.22]Back to the courtyard?
[331:08.14]The front courtyard there?
[331:12.70]That was a nice trick!
[331:25.47]I need to just... So, the two compasses, they don't really have a description.
[331:38.82]I'm gonna go, I'm gonna leave.
[331:41.65]Hopefully he's not just standing here.
[331:44.90]He definitely will be.
[331:45.74]And here's the butterflies again.
[331:50.08]Get away from me.
[331:50.68]You're going to do this stupid thing.
[331:51.52]You're going to get all... Can I... Why?
[331:56.22]What are these things even for?
[331:58.61]What are they for?
[332:00.01]No.
[332:00.49]This way.
[332:08.95]Alright, just, no, stop!
[332:14.87]I swear to god.
[332:17.77]I can't, I can't even do anything.
[332:21.86]Oh, I'm gonna die, and whatever, I'm gonna have to restart.
[332:30.74]Just walk into it.
[332:31.88]I'm so done.
[332:38.67]Let me ask you something.
[332:40.87]Where's your bow?
[332:42.95]Why don't you just have your bow and arrow out at all fucking times?
[332:47.74]You have to like get blessed and ask permission to use the bow?
[332:51.64]Just use the bow.
[332:53.28]Just have it.
[332:53.78]You don't have to like sprinkle fucking candy at people.
[332:58.83]There's a circular indentation.
[333:12.02]There's gonna be one on the other side too.
[333:13.16]Okay.
[333:14.80]Can I be out of this hellhole?
[333:20.89]She's in the Shadow Realm.
[333:23.47]Please tell me we can get out of the Shadow Realm.
[333:28.23]We got Meltdown Bruin!
[333:41.22]Only when Mummy says so.
[333:42.56]Well, I already have it refilled.
[333:44.04]I can save it here.
[333:44.92]I tell you, I'm getting real tired of reusing the same Chapter 3 enemy for the rest of the game.
[334:00.67]Can't we get, like, the mayor from Nightmare Before Christmas to come back?
[334:21.33]I made it out.
[334:22.87]Maybe.
[334:23.15]Something scary, something scary, something scary, something scary, something scary, something scary.
[334:33.05]I think so.
[334:33.67]Maybe.
[334:33.95]Well, that was an interesting angle to not have anything scary.
[334:43.75]This is a binding arrow.
[334:45.63]I don't have... They didn't teach me how to use that.
[335:01.55]The only clock tower in the game is in the save menu.
[335:05.65]I think technically we're inside of the clock tower.
[335:08.13]My true desire is to become an entity.
[335:10.21]There is no purer path than this.
[335:12.71]Remove the heart of a 15-year-old ruler of the same bloodline, and before the beat of our heart is stilled, drink deeply of her blood.
[335:22.60]Thus will the ritual of engagement be completed, and the dark power of the entity shall be thine.
[335:29.74]What?
[335:31.40]What the hell is this?
[336:07.65]Is it a new arrow?
[336:09.09]A new super arrow.
[336:15.33]Old Ruder Arrow.
[336:20.11]So did I get an arrow upgrade?
[336:23.93]That's how Ocarina of Time ended.
[336:29.55]Now we'll get sighted.
[336:30.45]Know what I mean?
[336:34.81]So now I can actually hurt this guy.
[336:44.33]I knew it was gonna happen.
[336:48.15]Here comes a guy with a Wicked Witch of the West laugh.
[336:51.71]And I'm gonna Arrow of Light him right in his sternum.
[336:54.59]Got to hurry back.
[336:56.71]Alright.
[336:59.31]It's that easy.
[337:13.00]Oh, you're back.
[337:14.46]I wonder, did you happen to get a new power?
[337:18.26]I just noticed his hair.
[337:19.42]Alyssa!
[337:20.60]What chance does a pathetic little girl like you have to bring salvation to the dead rooters?
[337:25.19]None!
[337:28.07]Alright, new power.
[337:33.71]Let's use it.
[337:35.57]We already know this guy.
[337:36.39]This guy's 900 years in prison.
[337:38.55]We're just doing it again.
[337:56.34]Do I have to equip them?
[337:57.52]Or is it auto-equipped?
[338:06.10]You guys tell me I was in the Shadow Realm and I couldn't use my powerful lightbow.
[338:10.95]What's this?
[338:16.67]Chopper, we already know.
[338:20.05]44 victims.
[338:20.69]Sentenced to 921 years.
[338:30.98]here we go I wasn't fast enough you are fast I'm gonna have to bind him come on two three he's taunting that's a good time to do it
[339:03.21]Okay, come on.
[339:03.87]One, two, three, four, five.
[339:07.05]Get it.
[339:07.27]Do it again.
[339:09.05]Again.
[339:14.26]Come on, again, again, again, again, again, again.
[339:15.80]Don't get hit by the boomerang thing.
[339:26.77]Take a step over here.
[339:27.59]Step over here.
[339:28.15]Fuck you.
[339:38.97]Have to do it again.
[339:39.75]God damn it.
[339:42.92]I'll tell you, all these boss fights really just feels like luck.
[339:48.14]You can do anything.
[340:09.77]Just catch it.
[340:20.98]That was a gigantic collision on that thing.
[340:35.51]Hit me in the face!
[340:37.82]No, that's not okay!
[341:05.88]Alright, stick, stick him, stick him!
[341:13.81]Duck!
[341:14.21]Duck!
[341:15.19]Duck!
[341:15.95]Duck!
[341:18.53]That didn't hit him.
[341:33.84]Fuck this game.
[341:34.72]Oh, that's the guard.
[341:37.66]Oh, nice trade, huh?
[341:44.02]You can't get away!
[341:56.23]Can I whittle him down like a bar of soap?
[342:06.13]Ugh...
[342:21.26]Alright, I'm gonna do- I wanted to beat this.
[342:24.12]I at least beat this guy.
[342:40.33]I gotta beat this guy!
[342:42.83]And then we'll play like a goofy one.
[342:45.97]Like- No, I don't have-
[342:49.36]Why do I even have that?
[342:50.36]It'll take... No, it's not gonna take too long.
[342:53.18]Why can't I just aim with the control stick?
[343:11.15]Is there a reason why you left that out of the game?
[343:34.86]Fuck you One more one more
[343:59.13]Bingo!
[343:59.39]Let's go.
[344:14.73]Uh-oh.
[344:30.53]That didn't... How did you not get... I feel like something broke here.
[344:55.89]I'm supposed to get like an ending cutscene that I beat it.
[344:58.91]Something's not right here.
[345:11.06]Something's not right.
[345:12.68]You can't get away!
[345:21.20]Kevin!
[345:21.78]You can't get away!
[345:38.08]What the fuck!
[345:38.92]Give me a second to do anything!
[345:41.26]What the fuck!
[345:48.09]Get out of my please!
[345:55.19]Oh my fucking god he has a sliver of health.
[346:14.93]That was anticlimactic.
[346:16.37]He was supposed to die from the big one.
[346:36.03]No, he... Okay, I was gonna say, this is like, I'm the enemy in the next chapter, too.
[346:57.91]Third piece of the puzzle.
[347:07.90]Clover of Hope.
[347:15.46]I killed that guy?
[347:16.84]Yeah.
[347:18.00]I know I did.
[347:23.69]Now will they know that I did this?
[347:28.53]Bye.
[347:49.15]Well done, Alyssa.
[347:50.77]Did I bring her back?
[347:53.05]No, the Merlin!
[347:53.89]You are whimsical!
[347:58.42]It's not that easy, Alyssa.
[348:01.70]Alyssa, it is I who will carry out the ritual of engagement to become an entity.
[348:07.35]You have no choice but to succumb to my final subordinate and donate your heart.
[348:25.77]Now you're in my domain.
[348:26.81]There's the clock tower.
[348:29.67]We made it.
[348:31.15]We made it to the clock tower.
[348:34.25]That's the weird guy.
[348:36.77]You're running really fast.
[348:38.59]What happened?
[348:39.51]What's the matter with your mother?
[348:54.07]What did you-
[349:23.22]You're right.
[349:24.24]I'll find all the leaves and save Mom from the entities.
[349:28.79]That's the spirit.
[349:30.37]Don't forget you can count on me.
[349:32.75]If there's anything I can do, just ask.
[349:38.83]Just one thing I'd like to know.
[349:42.11]Where the blazes are we?
[349:43.91]Is this place...
[349:57.64]Close, yeah.
[350:04.58]Dennis is going to get fucking eviscerated.
[350:07.03]Why do you think that?
[350:07.75]That's so terrible.
[350:26.60]We're a team now!
[350:28.92]Well, I gotta check something.
[350:31.08]Okay.
[350:31.94]I gotta make sure that, you know, I get a test.
[350:34.27]To see if you're a monster or not.
[350:39.33]God, I've got a companion now.
[350:40.67]Wait, you're not coming with me?
[350:42.66]Alyssa, wait for me!
[350:54.84]Now it's just a giant escort mission.
[350:56.43]This is gonna be hell.
[350:57.33]We're gonna have two health bars, aren't we?
[351:08.35]What?
[351:17.14]Where are we?
[351:17.68]Oh no.
[351:18.14]Oh no, he's gonna get eviscerated, isn't he?
[351:20.36]No.
[351:20.48]He's gonna get eviscerated.
[351:52.14]Hey, look!
[352:06.63]It's Helena Bonham Carter in every Tim Burton movie.
[352:11.29]And, okay, never mind, a bunch of other people.
[352:22.26]Nice to meet you, Alyssa.
[352:23.40]You have some remarkable powers.
[352:25.58]But no one is powerful enough to defeat us.
[352:28.34]If you want to find your love, give us your heart so we can create a new entity.
[352:34.65]What?
[352:34.77]Does she have him by the neck?
[352:36.61]Is that through him?
[352:40.15]Dennis!
[352:42.13]Dennis!
[352:42.37]Dennis!
[352:49.35]I thought that was through his neck.
[352:55.74]Okay.
[352:56.30]Well, we got a picture of... Photo of Mother.
[353:01.00]That's great.
[353:05.98]There's a body here who would do something like this.
[353:09.89]What?
[353:15.69]Dennis, letter to Linda.
[353:19.31]Hey sis, how's Africa?
[353:20.31]Have you seen any elephants?
[353:21.35]I'm not too bad.
[353:22.43]Living alone is really hard though.
[353:23.57]Don't know how you managed to raise me.
[353:25.09]I'll never say this to your face, but I do appreciate that, you know.
[353:28.10]When you get back, I'll find a job and do my share.
[353:30.40]Just another six months, it'll go by in a blink.
[353:32.68]I'll write again.
[353:33.30]Take care.
[353:33.98]Says Dennis.
[353:34.40]Is there a door?
[353:50.44]This music is the worst so far.
[353:54.28]That door won't open, that door won't open.
[354:03.50]It's... ultra clown music.
[354:07.86]It's the worst kind of clown music.
[354:13.81]Door won't open.
[354:17.67]Bathroom?
[354:18.19]Is there a save point I can get?
[354:28.62]Uh... Okay.
[354:32.86]Okay, that is a hiding spot.
[354:37.34]Ugh, this sucks.
[354:40.50]Alright, we got it, uh... There's a sturdy lock on it, it won't open.
[354:44.69]Is that a portal square?
[354:45.83]If only I could open this door.
[354:47.13]Ugh, this music's so bad.
[355:05.71]Do we really have to listen to this the whole time?
[355:10.88]Stand up!
[355:17.79]Looking glass.
[355:18.65]What's that do?
[355:21.39]I wonder why the cupboard doors don't open.
[355:23.52]They're not broken, there must be another way to open them.
[355:35.47]Strange motif on it.
[355:36.61]Definitely not a normal mirror.
[355:37.97]I still have these gloves.
[355:44.77]Somebody just said something really funny.
[355:47.10]King's Quest level of MIDI.
[355:49.60]It really is.
[355:52.52]This song really actually is in King's Quest.
[355:57.00]That was absolutely perfect.
[356:03.45]Well, I have a mirror now.
[356:13.16]Chair?
[356:13.48]Can I take the steel chair?
[356:22.70]I'm gonna start driving people fucking crazy.
[356:35.71]Do I have to look in mirrors?
[356:36.87]Oh, great.
[356:45.80]I need the bathroom.
[356:46.60]Ow!
[356:48.62]That hurts!
[356:52.11]Into the bathroom.
[356:54.41]Into the bathroom!
[356:58.19]Come on, Alyssa!
[357:16.41]Don't open that door.
[357:19.11]I'm almost... I'm about to panic.
[357:20.47]Thank you.
[357:21.81]Jesus.
[357:22.27]Alright.
[357:31.58]That's a hiding spot.
[357:32.46]So we can examine the mirror again?
[357:33.82]Maybe I should hold the mirror up to the mirror.
[357:41.82]The looking glass is reacting to the mirror.
[357:44.02]Let's see what happens.
[357:50.37]Alright.
[357:55.41]Uh, sure.
[357:55.97]I need a save point.
[358:03.24]So desperately.
[358:06.97]That's a release form.
[358:20.08]What does it say?
[358:25.93]Can I use the mirror?
[358:33.31]I can't use the mirror for this.
[358:43.38]Red realm.
[358:45.44]It is the mirror realm.
[358:46.80]You're right.
[358:52.84]What is this?
[358:56.68]Save point.
[359:01.55]Give me a holy water refill and a save point.
[359:13.02]And here, maybe?
[359:13.94]It's just the same thing mirrored.
[359:18.36]Let's look.
[359:21.91]There's nothing in here.
[359:27.62]Stand up.
[359:29.04]Why does it take you so long to stand up?
[359:33.16]Well, let's open up this.
[359:40.39]And here they come again.
[359:43.53]It's just lavender water.
[359:44.41]Good thing I just aggroed the bad guy.
[359:50.91]Okay, good, I aggroed.
[360:00.38]Oh!
[360:00.66]Back it up!
[360:01.36]All the way!
[360:01.82]All the way!
[360:02.16]Back up, back up!
[360:02.86]Go this way!
[360:13.11]You still in here?
[360:17.17]Are you still in here?
[360:29.99]Coming back.
[360:34.10]Gone.
[360:35.48]Nice.
[360:43.33]Shit.
[360:44.75]Keep going down?
[360:50.29]No, there's no save point down here.
[360:53.85]I'm shit out of luck.
[360:55.08]I have to...
[361:02.15]No, keep... Stupid things.
[361:12.59]Oh, come on!
[361:14.91]Not fair.
[361:15.39]How far is that fair?
[361:16.73]You show me the fairness that's in that.
[361:20.60]I can't... What the fuck are you supposed to do about this?
[361:22.64]Do I have an invisibility ban?
[361:26.56]No.
[361:27.04]I'm in a lot of trouble.
[361:37.06]Get the fuck off of me!
[361:46.24]Move.
[361:51.40]Why are you even in here?
[361:57.33]Door's not gonna open.
[362:03.09]What about this one?
[362:03.89]That door's not gonna open either.
[362:05.43]Oh, God.
[362:07.97]Leave me alone!
[362:08.81]Leave me alone!
[362:16.49]This is a photo of a child.
[362:24.37]That door's not gonna open either.
[362:25.95]Do any of these doors actually open?
[362:27.67]Bathroom.
[362:28.91]Fuck!
[362:32.57]No, I can't hide here.
[362:33.59]They know I'm here.
[362:47.83]Go in there!
[362:49.53]You took it so long to get in here!
[362:59.66]With the haste, with a sense of urgency!
[363:05.47]Refill with toilet water.
[363:08.75]They won't know the difference.
[363:19.28]Did you just really just do the Hulk Hogan entrance?
[363:21.10]Okay.
[363:43.39]Give me a save point.
[363:44.35]I need items too.
[363:47.67]Why would you- You were just- You were gone!
[363:49.81]You were gone!
[363:50.91]You were gone!
[363:52.25]You were gone!
[363:52.81]This door is not gonna open either!
[363:55.53]How- I can't believe it!
[363:57.10]I am actually shocked right now.
[363:58.96]Shocked beyond belief.
[364:01.78]There's no way that that's fair.
[364:04.40]I have no items.
[364:05.46]I have no save point.
[364:07.00]I have nothing.
[364:07.74]I'm gonna have to go through the mirror again.
[364:29.21]Is there a save point here?
[364:31.33]There's not even anything.
[364:32.95]There's a key that's required.
[364:34.49]I don't have it.
[364:35.27]There's no point to save the game.
[364:39.65]So what am I supposed to do?
[364:42.74]And you're already here.
[364:53.61]GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO
[365:33.12]No items.
[365:35.84]No... nothing.
[365:40.24]Thank god.
[365:43.30]Stop drinking soda?
[365:44.22]I'm not drinking soda, I'm drinking water.
[365:45.66]I'm drinking water.
[365:50.04]Stop drinking soda.
[365:52.63]I'm not just slamming Diet Cokes here, guys.
[366:01.06]Ah, key.
[366:02.44]Key B. I think I know what that is.
[366:06.57]I need a save point.
[366:15.60]There's a locked door out here.
[366:16.86]I'm gonna piss my pants.
[366:26.34]How did I miss that before?
[366:27.18]Because it was locked by the magical spell from the Mirror World.
[366:30.99]I had to go into the Mirror World, and when I did it in the Mirror World, I did the... I released it.
[366:35.33]It opened it in the real world as well.
[366:38.21]Funny how that works!
[366:40.27]Now where is... It's over here.
[366:46.29]Key B?
[366:47.77]If only I could open this door.
[366:48.59]You can.
[366:48.93]I have Key B, don't I?
[367:00.96]Let me see, key B. A gold key with a label on it.
[367:13.24]Where the hell is this?
[367:14.05]Is it a locked door?
[367:15.73]There's a ton of locked doors.
[367:21.49]There's a shitload of locked doors.
[367:31.03]Um... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[367:33.08]This person must also have been a victim.
[367:34.62]There's a corpse holding onto something.
[367:38.12]A furiously scribbled journal.
[367:40.04]How many bloody months have passed since they locked me in this excuse for a clinic?
[367:43.56]Those idiot doctors still find a reason for me to be here.
[367:45.92]I demand to be released.
[367:47.55]Every time I get a hospital release form, it is gone by morning.
[367:50.59]Get me out, please.
[367:51.51]Please let me out of here.
[367:52.49]I feel I will... I got that.
[367:53.87]I got you right here.
[367:56.33]Take it.
[367:57.17]And please give me an item that will keep me alive.
[368:01.63]There's a release form.
[368:13.40]And it is... Nice.
[368:16.54]That's very necessary right now, considering... Let me...
[368:31.87]Fucking goddamn that turn!
[368:33.51]That stupid turn!
[368:36.07]Anything else in here?
[368:43.43]Through the mirror.
[368:44.13]Wait.
[368:44.77]Key B?
[368:54.37]Key B. Door's not gonna open.
[368:58.86]That door's not gonna open.
[369:00.10]I need to Key B. That's not the right one.
[369:03.75]Key B?
[369:06.03]No, this is not correct.
[369:07.17]Key B. Key B?
[369:22.01]No, this is with the bugs!
[369:35.19]This level is, this level is absolute dog shit.
[369:38.51]I can't even leave.
[369:39.13]I'm gonna lose here.
[369:46.59]I can't go into any doors.
[369:48.91]Just try to run.
[369:52.12]He's gonna stop, he's gonna fall down the stairs.
[369:54.34]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[369:56.18]One, two, three, it's, no panic, stop!
[370:00.22]Key B!
[370:18.48]Where is this door?
[370:29.72]Is the door... here?
[370:31.97]Down here?
[370:32.61]The door with the circle... I tried the door with the circle behind it.
[370:48.46]Maybe go activate the portal with the mirror.
[370:50.40]That's not a bad idea.
[370:51.48]Can I go in that portal room though?
[370:58.63]I don't think I can.
[371:17.26]That's not going to open.
[371:17.98]None of these are going to do it.
[371:22.55]So let me try to go in that room and sprinkle on the ground.
[371:26.21]I have no idea.
[371:33.55]So it's this door here?
[371:35.25]Which one is it?
[371:36.79]That door's not going to open.
[371:53.96]It would be this room, right?
[372:02.76]That's the one I'm in right now.
[372:05.28]No?
[372:10.46]Just pee in the bottle.
[372:17.46]This one?
[372:20.77]Is this like the portal room?
[372:24.94]Hey.
[372:25.18]Hi.
[372:25.56]You're back.
[372:26.36]Is the save point at the front desk?
[372:40.84]Front desk.
[372:41.42]So I'm just gonna go all the way back down.
[372:54.35]Can you please leave me alone?
[372:56.83]Leave me alone.
[372:57.19]So I have to go through the door and then go back all the way down.
[373:00.51]Just get out of here.
[373:09.82]That door won't open.
[373:10.52]She can't get in here.
[373:15.83]Oh my god, there she is.
[373:23.68]I have to get out of the mirror realm and then go all the way downstairs.
[373:40.53]Done.
[373:41.91]Enough.
[373:42.51]Teleport out, please.
[373:43.59]And let me go back to the mirror realm.
[373:44.97]Okay.
[373:49.34]This level sucks.
[373:50.38]It really does.
[373:56.31]Through the mirror.
[374:01.84]And then from the mirror, we're gonna go all the way down.
[374:12.22]Just avoid... Avoid everybody.
[374:18.19]Just go down.
[374:18.75]I have five splashes.
[374:24.07]Should be enough.
[374:28.50]Just in case, hold on, just in case.
[374:33.65]Get back out of here.
[374:36.29]Hold on, this is like, can I put something here?
[374:37.73]This is like a photo.
[374:40.85]I have... Letter from... Letter?
[374:44.79]How about the photo of a... of a woman?
[374:50.12]How about a photo of a child?
[374:52.20]Bingo.
[374:55.26]Give me something I can use.
[375:04.43]This item is stupid.
[375:06.21]I would have rathered one of those lavender juices.
[375:15.90]Let's get back out.
[375:22.40]Alright.
[375:24.78]What is this thing?
[375:27.28]The phone line's been cut.
[375:28.79]Who's... Slimer's coming over here.
[375:31.19]Alright, alright.
[375:31.71]I'm almost there.
[375:35.60]Can I give anything to... Wait a minute.
[375:39.38]Lavender water?
[375:44.36]Sculpture of a woman fetching water.
[375:46.38]Nothing out of the ordinary.
[375:49.82]Key A. Yes!
[375:55.72]Before anything bad happens, just...
[376:06.30]I have another photo I'm going to give over there.
[376:11.04]Thank God for the save point.
[376:20.23]A huge weight has just been lifted off my shoulders.
[376:23.13]Alright, what about this guy over here?
[376:26.13]Patient on crutches, even the sick and wounded.
[376:29.82]Can I give you this photo or something?
[376:32.46]Photo mom?
[376:33.62]Yep.
[376:41.53]Yeah, that was 30 in-game minutes without a save.
[376:43.40]That would have been terrible.
[376:46.88]Alright, I've got some items here.
[376:49.50]Let's get a good save point.
[377:01.53]I can't believe I'm gonna probably complete this game today.
[377:05.26]I'm surprised as hell.
[377:08.89]Alright, it's time for the final pee of the night.
[377:10.75]Last pee break of the night.
[377:14.51]I'll be right back.
[380:43.82]Hey.
[380:47.20]Okie dokie.
[380:49.74]So I got two keys.
[380:54.22]Plenty of water.
[380:57.10]Can I even go out here?
[380:59.62]No.
[380:59.94]I have to find Dennis.
[381:04.74]So I have key A and key B. Don't ask me...
[381:13.54]What am I supposed to do now?
[381:15.04]Is that enough to open that door?
[381:18.98]I wonder if that's enough.
[381:23.80]Thank god it's a safe point, though.
[381:30.85]Anything else down here that I missed?
[381:35.69]You were playing Apex instead of peeing.
[381:38.86]Yeah, I got another computer downstairs and on my breaks I squat up.
[381:43.45]I just don't pull my parachute out.
[381:44.61]I just land on the ground and die.
[381:47.65]And then I come back up here.
[382:00.29]He's got a computer in the bathroom.
[382:01.65]Alright, so now where am I supposed to go?
[382:04.23]I have... This is coming back this way.
[382:15.17]The double doors?
[382:20.59]Probably the double doors.
[382:21.65]I haven't gone in here, have I?
[382:22.95]No, they won't open.
[382:24.47]Neither will that.
[382:29.81]I hear you!
[382:30.56]I can hear you!
[382:38.86]Oh, please.
[382:40.06]Really.
[382:49.16]in in in in in in so I need a third key you guys are saying third key oh let me crunch on something for a second don't open that door
[383:31.33]Nope.
[383:33.07]I need another key.
[383:36.81]That's ridiculous.
[383:40.79]Well, let's go through and check it again.
[383:44.04]What am I eating?
[383:50.40]These are the Keebler Club and Cheddar Sandwiches.
[383:53.18]They're like those little
[383:56.86]Club crackers with cheese.
[383:59.52]They're really good.
[384:03.92]Where's the bathroom?
[384:05.00]Everyone's telling me to go to the bathroom.
[384:06.32]Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
[384:10.28]It's all the way down, isn't it?
[384:18.55]What's that bathroom?
[384:20.21]All the way down?
[384:24.25]Not as good as the peanut butter ones?
[384:25.21]I don't like the peanut butter ones as much.
[384:28.18]Peanut butter ones... Well, I mean, I do like cheese more than I like peanut butter.
[384:45.77]Come on in.
[384:52.65]Come find me, sure.
[385:15.03]These are the two by far worst enemies in this game.
[385:31.22]Leave.
[385:31.50]Alright, last cracker.
[385:33.84]Going in.
[385:34.14]No!
[385:44.74]Oh, that's not good.
[385:53.61]I got the key!
[385:55.25]I got the key!
[385:56.75]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[386:03.92]You didn't wash hands.
[386:05.86]Living is more important.
[386:31.17]No, no, wait a minute I need, I don't have enough of that I need a refill I need a refill I just used it on his face
[386:46.20]Oh no.
[386:48.22]Bad news.
[386:51.08]That's really bad news.
[387:00.08]Let's just open the damn door.
[387:12.93]These two suck.
[387:14.13]These two suck.
[387:24.99]Go back down and save?
[387:25.75]Not a bad idea.
[387:35.96]Leave!
[387:36.88]Go!
[387:37.22]Alright, he's gone.
[387:44.24]Let's go back down, refill, save, and then come back.
[387:50.15]This is too stressful to watch.
[387:53.74]It's very stressful to play as well.
[387:55.92]Wait, open the door.
[387:57.42]No, save it first.
[387:58.18]Okay.
[388:19.09]There's no more ghosts down here.
[388:21.71]I cleared them.
[388:23.47]Just have to save it.
[388:25.73]Feel relaxed again.
[388:26.80]I just love feeling relaxed.
[388:31.34]Watch this.
[388:31.72]This is going to just... My muscles are going to just melt.
[388:38.92]Taking a hot bath.
[388:50.38]I'm gonna hurry up and beat the game.
[388:53.88]I'm going.
[388:57.28]I'm on it.
[388:58.04]I'm on it.
[389:12.35]I got it under control.
[389:20.40]Use the keys.
[389:22.90]I have five splashes.
[389:24.96]Hopefully this will get me out of here.
[389:30.01]This could be a door lock.
[389:32.13]The labeled key may work.
[389:33.47]Use them all.
[389:39.83]Thank god.
[389:43.32]Anything else in here?
[389:46.78]There's that.
[389:50.25]Nothing else?
[389:50.89]What about in the sink?
[389:52.53]Nothing.
[389:54.39]Alright.
[389:55.31]Let's see where this takes us.
[390:10.14]Get the fuck off this game and play Red Dead Redemption 2!
[390:14.60]I already beat Red Dead Redemption 2.
[390:17.27]I didn't beat it on stream, I beat it off stream.
[390:22.57]Red Dead 2.
[390:23.05]Get out of this game.
[390:28.09]I've used that exact lightning sound effect.
[390:30.07]Actually, I used it on Christmas.
[390:35.63]The train.
[390:36.33]When the train goes over the tracks and gets the lightning strike thing. ...
[390:48.41]What the hell is this?
[390:50.22]That's Grandpa, right?
[391:18.58]Play every game ever on stream.
[391:24.20]Very hard to do.
[391:25.00]We're going to get a narration here, I think.
[391:31.61]Yep, I knew it.
[391:35.07]See you guys when you wake up in like 10 minutes.
[391:37.85]I wish for nothing more than to watch over her all her life.
[391:47.39]I can't mute the music.
[391:48.25]It's impossible.
[392:02.92]I have stumbled across an incredible document, an account of a ceremony called the Ritual of Engagement.
[392:10.58]It is written that by obtaining the heart of a Rudar on her 15th birthday and drinking her blood, a person can be transformed into an entity and receive the gift of immortality.
[392:23.59]I am disgusted by the nature of this ritual, of course.
[392:27.43]But at the same time, there is a part of me that cannot resist its allure.
[392:32.67]If I tore out Alyssa's heart with these hands and partook of her blood, I could be joined with her for all eternity.
[392:41.03]Am I capable of such a monstrosity?
[392:44.45]Must I desecrate my beloved in order to save myself?
[392:51.95]Yet another amazing discovery.
[392:54.51]The legend of Lord Burrus.
[392:57.75]In the document is a mysterious triangular crest.
[393:02.15]I can't skip this.
[393:03.17]Alyssa, Dennis, and Nancy, whatever our names are.
[393:31.47]Let's figure out the end of the game.
[393:33.49]Non-disclosure agreement.
[393:35.99]I don't understand.
[393:36.75]He's just reading off, like, a concept for an RPG.
[393:41.15]He, like, got invited to the Blizzard headquarters or something?
[393:56.37]Save point.
[394:05.69]The NDA.
[394:07.41]I don't understand what it means.
[394:09.79]I just see all this weird shit about demons and monsters and drinking people's blood.
[394:18.60]It also somehow down here mentions something called loot boxes.
[394:23.06]Which is surprising to me.
[394:24.30]I've never really seen that term before in a $60 game.
[394:27.52]It's very interesting.
[394:30.71]What are you doing here?
[394:31.35]What are you doing here?
[394:32.17]What the fuck?
[394:32.89]Shit.
[394:41.60]Ah, good thing I just saved it.
[394:43.50]He's mocking me.
[394:50.20]I couldn't move.
[394:53.12]I couldn't fucking move.
[395:08.31]I hope she's okay.
[395:16.33]Okay, it's a good thing I saved, really.
[395:17.49]That would have been pretty bad.
[395:22.37]Seriously, Jeremiah?
[395:23.25]I could beat that.
[395:25.85]Let's take care of that right off the bat.
[395:30.38]Because now we can predict it.
[395:34.76]Watch, you'll be right up my ass in a second here.
[395:37.88]I told you.
[395:39.58]No, how did you even... You got in front of me!
[395:47.41]Open!
[395:47.83]Hurry!
[395:49.77]Get in the door!
[395:50.79]Now I'm in the center of the clock tower.
[395:55.86]Another piano segment.
[396:01.56]Everybody plays the piano in these games.
[396:08.06]Yeah, no, everyone's gonna correct me.
[396:09.13]That's an organ.
[396:10.55]An organ is just a giant piano made of tubes.
[396:13.53]I thought that was a sexual thing right there.
[396:17.86]I thought these were all... I thought all these could... I... No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[396:37.19]Just look around.
[396:37.75]There's probably items.
[396:42.22]There is.
[396:48.32]This guy's in the middle of a guitar solo and won't stop.
[396:58.06]Alright, alright, settle down, Slash.
[397:21.44]There's another arrow over here.
[397:37.49]Why did no one notice?
[397:40.54]The amount of dexterity it takes to do what this person is doing.
[397:51.38]That's the hardest Beat Saber level I think I've ever seen.
[397:53.38]Alright, I don't know if this is the right way, but I'm just gonna do it.
[398:13.05]Oh, hi.
[398:16.17]Hi again.
[398:26.59]It's on the ground here.
[398:27.35]Another narration by Grandpa.
[398:30.07]Employee memo.
[398:33.99]I've received orders from Ralph and Jemima to kill still more.
[398:39.18]I cannot continue in this fashion.
[398:41.10]I killed 10 last week and this week they want 20.
[398:43.50]When will it stop?
[398:45.22]Soon there will not be a person left in the entire village.
[398:48.55]I must do something about this.
[398:49.81]They are to be imprisoned in the kitchen.
[398:52.31]One of the steel bars on the window can be removed.
[398:55.63]I do hope that they are able to see that before it's too late.
[398:58.60]And once they escape, I pray that they will tell the world of the atrocities that go on behind these walls.
[399:04.32]That's not Christopher Walken.
[399:07.32]Alright, so one of the steel bars on the window can be removed.
[399:10.45]Got it.
[399:12.83]Let's, uh, make this guy fall.
[399:17.45]There was a little thing there.
[399:18.21]What happened to the thing that was there?
[399:32.42]There was a green indicator there and I couldn't do it.
[399:34.44]Can't wait to hear that again.
[400:17.73]Come on Alyssa's right Is it bad that I don't give a shit about these arrows?
[400:40.69]They haven't done anything for me the whole game
[400:59.33]Unless it just falls down.
[401:00.79]Alright.
[401:01.25]Let's... Let me go up.
[401:27.03]How do I throw an axe at the person playing the piano?
[401:29.15]Do I have to walk this whole thing?
[401:42.04]Do I have to go around the entire core?
[401:55.96]I hope this is not a waste of time, because if it is, I have to go back down.
[402:16.05]Alright, look at that.
[402:17.13]It was a waste of time.
[402:18.10]Back down.
[402:52.97]Worst stream of the year?
[402:55.17]Wait, why?
[402:55.83]I've been having fun.
[402:58.69]Wait, what?
[402:59.53]Do you think so?
[403:01.01]I don't think so.
[403:03.19]That's not true.
[403:04.01]Uh, there's another door I can try.
[403:15.44]Are you having fun, though?
[403:16.48]I mean, well, was I having fun on The Simpsons hit-and-run stream near the end?
[403:20.73]Debatable, but I got sucked in and I had to complete it.
[403:23.59]That's what we're doing now.
[403:33.99]Let's try this side.
[403:43.17]I may have been possessed by the devil during that stream.
[403:50.81]My soul got torn out of my body probably three times.
[404:12.56]I don't think I can cross here.
[404:21.20]I cannot cross here.
[404:26.66]Item on the other side?
[404:27.45]No.
[404:35.85]This is currently the best Jerma stream online at the moment.
[404:41.68]I guess so.
[405:00.32]Please mute the game.
[405:05.34]I can't.
[405:10.72]Please mute the game for five minutes.
[405:14.38]Oh, shit!
[405:15.74]Can I throw the... I didn't deal with you.
[405:18.34]Good thing you didn't see me.
[405:19.42]That lady's coming to fish.
[405:21.68]Can I climb over this?
[405:22.48]Um, I don't know what to do about this.
[405:29.40]We're good.
[405:40.84]Okay.
[405:42.46]Made it.
[405:42.94]Made it, made it, made it, made it.
[405:45.48]Go.
[405:47.14]Now what?
[405:48.70]Is there an item here?
[405:56.04]It's locked.
[405:57.04]Alright, thanks for telling me to come over here.
[406:09.57]Can I sneak in the bars?
[406:10.99]One of the bars can be removed, right?
[406:13.97]I can't get in from here.
[406:16.29]Oh, shut up.
[406:30.59]Get away from me.
[406:58.07]I need the bars info.
[407:00.47]Read the thing again?
[407:01.49]I need to read the note about the bars.
[407:12.66]What do you mean then?
[407:13.44]What do you mean?
[407:26.69]And the files?
[407:31.17]Files.
[407:48.99]Ugh, dot, wait, I died?
[407:50.17]So what I did, because I didn't read the note, I can't use, I can't climb through the...
[408:11.22]He's trying my patience now.
[408:16.05]You didn't know about the bar.
[408:33.69]So I have to go back around and... Where was the note?
[408:40.68]God, I have no idea.
[408:44.96]You're losing people.
[408:46.46]Well, it is getting me late.
[408:51.67]It is getting me late.
[408:53.69]And I am blowing out people's eardrums with the same spam on an organ.
[408:59.59]So it doesn't surprise me.
[409:13.01]Alright, I gotta be ready for this guy.
[409:13.89]I'm just gonna run to the end.
[409:28.78]And you caught me, still.
[409:30.88]Oh, I'm ready.
[409:33.47]There's gonna be an indicator here.
[409:35.03]You explained to me why- how did- I don't- I don't- There's no reason for it!
[409:38.59]There's no reason for it!
[409:40.87]Thank you.
[409:42.17]Thank you.
[409:58.12]Okay, we're gonna read the note.
[410:01.39]Hey, uh, I must do something about this.
[410:04.53]They're to be imprisoned in the kitchen.
[410:05.81]One of the steel bars on the window can be removed.
[410:08.27]I do hope that they're able to see that.
[410:16.50]Isn't that just wonderful?
[410:19.24]No, don't you dare.
[410:20.22]Don't make me panic.
[410:20.90]Alright, do it again.
[410:23.32]Wrap around.
[410:41.60]And then they start playing again.
[410:57.21]Sour, please.
[410:59.33]Alright, let's go.
[411:24.41]For your sanity.
[411:37.83]I'm leaving.
[411:38.49]Fuck you.
[411:39.13]God.
[411:39.64]What?
[411:40.64]I'm sorry.
[411:42.98]Look, I'll turn it down.
[411:43.84]I turned it down.
[411:44.62]See?
[411:44.86]I turned it off.
[411:48.88]I turned it down.
[412:01.35]Okay, that doesn't work.
[412:02.17]I have to wrap around here.
[412:03.29]Alright.
[412:14.66]You can escape.
[412:18.40]There must be the steel bars.
[412:20.11]Remove the loose one.
[412:21.39]Yeah.
[412:23.25]There'll be a tight squeeze.
[412:24.23]Go in there.
[412:24.71]Yes.
[412:28.63]Alright, I'm in the kitchen.
[412:29.37]Don't fuck this up.
[412:30.09]I don't want to do that whole stupid sequence again.
[412:31.95]Who's in the oven?
[412:34.73]What's in it?
[412:35.75]No, don't open it yet.
[412:47.13]Thank god I didn't open it.
[412:48.65]Oh, I didn't open it!
[412:50.37]I didn't open it and it was the right decision.
[413:02.66]Thank God I didn't just immediately open that.
[413:08.83]If you wish to open the other path, calm the flames.
[413:15.87]Uh, guys.
[413:18.40]I don't know if the game is trying to tell me this here, but do I have to go get the fire extinguisher from four and a half hours ago?
[413:34.80]Is that what I have to do?
[413:49.85]There are mounds of ash brushed into a pile.
[413:53.27]I heard that they used ash to extinguish fires back then.
[414:02.35]Can I have some?
[414:15.68]Do I need a shovel?
[414:18.90]Fire in the stove is flaring.
[414:20.72]I think I see something back there.
[414:31.07]Can I pick up one of these?
[414:33.13]Kitchen knife, maybe?
[414:38.63]I unlocked the door.
[414:41.49]I guess that's a good thing to do.
[414:46.09]Yeah, there is a shovel there, so why can't I just use it?
[414:48.11]There's a shovel just actually sitting in here.
[414:56.96]You're giving me the opportunity now.
[415:03.84]Okay.
[415:09.42]The fire has died out.
[415:11.17]You collected the A-Crest.
[415:15.22]You collected a crest.
[415:18.20]She's gone.
[415:23.76]Nope, she's dead.
[415:30.12]That's what's left of her.
[415:42.85]I don't like the suit of armor.
[415:53.49]Fuck.
[416:09.21]Thank God.
[416:11.09]Come here, come here, come here.
[416:12.91]Save it.
[416:13.49]Quickly.
[416:26.28]Turn on smart click.
[416:33.67]Should have a car emote.
[416:37.95]Uh, holy water?
[416:39.33]Fountain?
[416:41.31]No?
[416:45.88]This should be a fountain here.
[416:49.20]Okay.
[416:50.76]I'm glad to see that you've regenerated your skull.
[416:54.34]It's really wonderful.
[416:57.09]You grew your head back real quick.
[417:07.16]Shut up.
[417:10.60]Oh, I'm just realizing something right now.
[417:13.19]I have to fight two people at the same time.
[417:14.75]That's gonna be impossible.
[417:25.52]Large painting, there is a title on it.
[417:28.80]N loving mother suffers in place of daughter A. Okay.
[417:44.88]This is... I... That's the same thing.
[417:49.22]Which door did she come out of?
[417:50.09]This one?
[417:52.97]No, this is the one... I'm going the wrong way.
[418:02.88]Let's wait for... Oh, good.
[418:09.53]Huh?
[418:09.73]What happened there?
[418:23.88]Hmm.
[418:25.26]Hmm.
[418:39.23]What's that?
[418:40.63]Oh, and then I realized that I can't believe that the entity, if you could believe it, I've been around the globe a thousand years and my shoes were all dirty and they fucked it all up and I couldn't believe that my own daughter is the one that I have to sacrifice.
[419:00.42]These are unskippable.
[419:01.24]The triangular crest can be solved.
[419:03.74]I feel sure.
[419:08.55]It is hard to believe that three years have flown by since I embarked on my journey.
[419:14.09]I am not a smidgen closer to finding Burra's castle.
[419:17.98]Meanwhile, I grow older by the day, and my health continues to decline.
[419:23.98]I am certain that Nancy has by this time found my journals, and realized my plan to seize Elissa's heart on her 15th birthday to carry out the ritual of engagement.
[419:35.98]How Alyssa must have grown in my absence.
[419:39.24]How I wish to be with her, to be one with her.
[419:43.36]And yet, I do not have the courage to perform her ritual.
[419:48.17]What do I do?
[419:50.27]If I do nothing, I am no better than her father.
[419:54.67]This Hamilton, at least, should have spine.
[420:02.62]Yeah.
[420:05.29]Alright.
[420:06.71]Thanks, Grandpa.
[420:08.11]Good luck.
[420:11.09]All these books are about torture and slaughter.
[420:13.30]Who would collect such horrible books?
[420:15.84]Yeah, I think that's Grampy.
[420:17.28]Grampy's the one.
[420:20.66]Lavender water.
[420:21.40]Yeah, uh-huh.
[420:27.69]I knew you were here.
[420:30.41]I didn't think I was.
[420:31.05]Stupid.
[420:32.43]Move.
[420:36.67]Another area here to... I don't know where this is going to end up.
[420:41.73]Wait.
[420:43.19]Wait a minute.
[420:43.63]Wait, what's happening here?
[420:45.33]Wait a second.
[420:46.39]What?
[420:48.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[420:52.79]Did I just go... Did I just go back up?
[421:07.15]Okay, so, hold on.
[421:12.65]What am I supposed- What the hell am I supposed to do now?
[421:28.02]What does this crest mean?
[421:29.34]A crest.
[421:44.70]You beat it.
[421:45.12]Time to shut it off.
[421:59.85]A crest.
[422:01.57]No, that's the N crest.
[422:03.86]I need a D crest.
[422:05.82]Do I put another crest in here?
[422:12.22]She can't get over here.
[422:27.47]I'm guessing we're gonna get out of here.
[422:30.76]So I need- I have A, I have N, I need D. Where's the D crest?
[422:42.69]Is the guy's dead body across the way here?
[422:44.55]This is- this has to be this ghost, right?
[422:57.64]Can I go this way now?
[422:58.54]I have to jump.
[423:05.44]I can't jump.
[423:16.03]I've got to go all the way back around.
[423:22.95]Where the hell is she?
[423:31.98]Anything else in here that I missed?
[423:33.22]Anything?
[423:33.62]These things are going to come alive.
[423:39.72]I know it.
[423:40.32]Here they come.
[423:49.91]Can I... Let me just save it.
[423:58.80]Everyone's saying, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[424:02.17]and loving mother suffers in place of daughter a wrong wrong you're wrong wrong wrong she's gone Jerma you're safe except for the lady in the room right now
[424:32.05]What magical plant are you smoking?
[424:48.94]Great, come back over here.
[424:49.80]Can I put you inside that again?
[425:03.82]What the hell am I doing?
[425:09.74]She's not gonna come over here, right?
[425:22.76]Let me just put the skull on this guy's head.
[425:38.33]Jump off the balcony.
[425:47.71]Yeah, can't you move a little faster?
[425:56.14]Alright, now is this guy lying on the ground here?
[425:58.18]Can I give him the skull?
[426:01.08]Wasn't there somebody lying down?
[426:03.54]Oh, shit.
[426:08.69]Uh, wait.
[426:09.69]God damn it.
[426:12.37]I need to... I need to put the... swap the crests.
[426:16.21]I couldn't activate the other one before, though.
[426:18.49]I couldn't activate the thing on the wall.
[426:31.02]This is the worst stream.
[426:34.10]How is this any different than the... What are you talking about?! !
[426:55.53]I gotta go back where the fountains were.
[426:56.97]The fountains are here.
[426:58.91]This way, right?
[427:10.44]Somebody said to go to the fountains?
[427:14.90]Fuck this dumb game.
[427:34.57]Yeah, it is a thumbs.
[428:09.35]Gamer license revoked.
[428:13.25]It doesn't matter.
[428:13.89]I just want to get out of this area.
[428:17.93]Examine the fountains.
[428:28.50]Did the Wikipedia page give me bullshit?! !
[428:46.23]What a beautiful candlestick.
[428:47.23]It's been moved.
[428:48.35]Return it?
[428:48.81]Yes.
[428:53.67]No, nobody edited the Wikipedia page.
[428:55.83]The Wikipedia page did not get edited.
[428:59.79]It's correct.
[429:05.49]How are you supposed to know that?
[429:06.57]I guess because of the cat scratches on the table.
[429:25.36]I just checked the changelogs.
[429:26.76]Chat fucked with you just now.
[429:30.44]No, they... How?
[429:33.31]There's no way.
[429:44.31]I'm so close.
[429:45.07]I can tell.
[429:45.51]I can taste it.
[429:47.19]Okay.
[429:50.77]So, let's... Let me just see what this says.
[429:53.07]So this says...
[429:55.02]N loving mother suffers in place of daughter A. So... Will you go home, please?
[430:02.79]Insert the N crest.
[430:03.91]I don't have an option.
[430:11.81]You're not going to have any eyes left by the time we're done here.
[430:14.52]Just please.
[430:23.06]There we go.
[430:28.69]Get away from me!
[430:29.75]I have six bosses left.
[430:42.64]Now that is an edited Wikipedia chat article.
[430:49.79]I'm certain.
[431:05.68]He's still going to be following me.
[431:07.62]One of the knights is going to start moving.
[431:16.31]Weird statue.
[431:16.95]I wonder if it's a device of some sort.
[431:19.65]I don't know.
[431:22.01]Weird statue.
[431:22.67]Is this a device?
[431:26.29]Lady, leave me the fuck alone.
[431:27.79]I'm going to be the most irritating person ever.
[431:45.04]Okay.
[431:45.76]Does that mean she's gone?
[431:50.00]I believe so.
[431:53.44]Is this Grandpa's room?
[432:02.43]I don't know.
[432:08.70]It's a cool painting.
[432:21.10]Okay.
[432:22.80]Actually, I was just dumbfounded by that painting.
[432:25.45]I got the decrest.
[432:35.09]I'm skimming it.
[432:36.95]Despite his harsh reputation, Lord Boros loved his daughter dearly.
[432:40.50]Gave her all of his land.
[432:42.70]When he was 50, he was afraid of his life.
[432:47.57]He learned about the entities and the rituals.
[432:50.67]His daughter was turning almost 15 years old.
[432:52.37]He made the fateful decision to perform the ritual.
[432:54.20]He ate her heart.
[432:56.14]Something's happened.
[432:58.04]Right before her 15th birthday, she died.
[433:00.25]In a carriage, she was enrolled into its side.
[433:04.17]Shocked that she died by his beloved daughter, as well as the inability to realize the ritual, fell into a deep depression.
[433:10.83]He was replaced with raging anger.
[433:13.47]He's really mad.
[433:14.73]Though he had both the coachman and the maid who were with Annabelle at the time of her death killed.
[433:19.47]It did little to sausage his anger.
[433:22.92]The massacre of his staff continued, even extending to the villages and lands.
[433:27.14]His wife did what she could to convince him to cut it out.
[433:30.58]Don't do that, but only succeeded in inflaming him further.
[433:33.89]And she, too, was actually killed as well.
[433:37.69]Lord Darcy Burrow, eventually, he died.
[433:40.09]He got his head crushed with two logs.
[433:42.43]Two logs squished his head in the clock tower.
[433:46.74]of the castle as he escaped from mobs of angry farmers according to legend he was he had died he was gonna put a plague on the world and then the clock tower was still there something is trapped between the volumes is this no no you know you can't bait me with that I have I'm not gonna get baited with this castle I have finally solved the mystery
[434:16.20]Lord D'Arcy Burroughs had a daughter, Annabel, but also a son, William, from his first marriage.
[434:23.10]Although Burroughs himself was killed, William escaped and lived out the rest of his days in peace under the pseudonym... And so his head was squished between two large logs.
[434:35.32]Home Alone 2 style.
[434:36.76]Lord Burroughs' beloved daughter Annabelle's name.
[434:38.30]His first name, Darcy.
[435:13.34]Did I get it?
[435:14.60]Dick?
[435:42.50]Oh, it's a TV screen.
[435:48.06]This just is Pee Wee Herman.
[435:52.00]This is the bike scene.
[435:59.51]How do I get out there?
[436:04.75]Should I open up this, like, clam chair?
[436:06.31]Alright, I have depressed.
[436:11.48]Is there anywhere I need to put this in particular?
[436:14.54]Not going to kill me?
[436:15.12]Fine.
[436:21.96]A hidden switch is illuminated.
[436:23.20]Yes.
[436:26.26]That's where the decress goes.
[436:36.93]But I need to save it.
[436:39.80]Where was the save point?
[436:40.68]It was back here, right?
[436:41.82]Was there one back here?
[436:50.28]I'm trapped.
[436:54.90]Well, just put it in.
[436:55.74]I was looking for an item!
[437:08.46]So that just opened the door that I just came in.
[437:11.68]Oh, what a twist.
[437:21.07]Oh, fuck.
[437:25.67]Why am I going in the Iron Maiden?
[437:27.03]Did I just die?
[437:43.58]I don't like this music.
[437:46.24]Skulls?
[437:49.40]Wait a minute.
[437:50.96]Oh, really?
[437:52.94]So, it's... These are all budged up.
[438:16.44]That's too bad.
[438:19.09]Seven hours later, still going.
[438:20.59]Still driving around circle.
[438:46.49]I opened it.
[438:47.23]Yep.
[438:47.33]There are the skulls.
[438:54.43]Did you tell me this thought?
[438:57.69]I can't... Dude, are there those skulls?
[439:05.12]No.
[439:06.10]It's getting louder.
[439:07.66]I'll turn it down.
[439:31.38]There's nothing here?
[439:32.14]Because I don't have anything to get out of here.
[439:38.04]I mean, this is just... Going the other Iron Maiden?
[439:49.33]I guess, yeah.
[439:49.83]I mean, I have to... There's no way I'm not going to go through the gauntlet here.
[440:24.40]I didn't know he came across like that.
[440:26.28]I thought they all go up and down.
[440:27.51]I don't know where I am.
[440:28.59]I don't know how far away this is.
[440:38.32]Thank god.
[440:39.16]Where is this?
[440:58.52]Ooh.
[441:01.60]Invisibility ban.
[441:14.75]This one's now open.
[441:16.81]Okay.
[441:22.06]So I have a way to get back through the second one.
[441:27.58]The door prevents entry.
[441:29.42]There's another one right there.
[441:50.17]You missed a key near the maiden in the top right corner.
[441:53.90]I did?
[441:54.14]Come on.
[442:03.45]He doesn't hit me with the backswing, does he?
[442:26.37]What's this?
[442:28.01]There's a lever on the wall.
[442:29.65]Pull it.
[442:35.73]Okay.
[442:39.01]I opened that.
[442:39.55]Now I gotta go and get this door open.
[442:44.40]This game is a torture device.
[442:49.58]Ah!
[442:52.56]No, don't do that.
[442:53.52]I have to do it in that order.
[442:54.60]I gotta go to the second one.
[442:57.07]Shit.
[442:57.71]No.
[442:59.79]Oh, that sucks.
[443:00.83]Alright, so I have to... I have to go and open that door and then...
[443:25.40]I don't- he's gonna swing.
[443:26.50]And then you're gonna swing.
[443:30.66]When do you swing?
[443:31.44]Why did I do it?!
[443:46.94]I couldn't have timed that perfectly, even if I tried.
[443:52.88]That was an inhuman timing.
[443:58.21]I'm just going to do it in order.
[443:59.05]I'm so close.
[444:05.15]Alright.
[444:05.51]It's which one is it?
[444:06.37]It's the one I don't even know.
[444:08.85]It's this one right here.
[444:09.83]Open up the door.
[444:13.53]Click.
[444:20.33]Here we go.
[444:20.82]Open it.
[444:22.89]It's open.
[444:29.49]This shit's open now.
[444:40.77]Okay, now we just gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta go down here.
[444:46.73]I don't remember.
[444:47.35]DON'T!
[444:50.93]When does it happen?
[444:51.65]Swing!
[444:52.03]Why is the one in the middle not swinging?
[444:57.49]Fucking no!
[444:58.91]I can't!
[445:04.29]I swear to fucking God, man.
[445:07.11]Let's put this shit in the game.
[445:08.75]Let's put this crap in the game.
[445:10.40]This is what this is.
[445:10.98]This is crap.
[445:12.34]This is crap.
[445:13.46]It is.
[445:16.58]He swings side.
[445:17.30]But if I crawl, then I'm running out of time to get past the next guy.
[445:21.47]oh it's crap I was gonna see what happens okay you have to be crawling you have to be crawling first of all I just needed to test it to see you have to be crawling
[445:49.78]If you're crawling, it goes over you.
[445:51.44]If you're just crouching, it does not.
[445:53.70]Hypothesis has been shown.
[445:56.42]And been done.
[445:57.20]And I'm ready.
[446:04.78]I had it that first time.
[446:06.18]Fucking god damn it.
[446:10.17]This has got to be the end of the game.
[446:11.09]I'm at the end of the game.
[446:12.59]The game is ending very soon here.
[446:14.13]I just have to get to the end.
[446:23.10]Open this door.
[446:33.65]I can't believe I've... This is supposed to be like PlayStation 2.
[446:36.95]We're going to have to play like four or five games tonight.
[446:39.34]No, I've been playing this one for seven and a half hours.
[446:49.74]So this one comes down, then you can go across, crawl underneath it.
[446:54.69]No, I can make it by.
[446:56.07]I could go right now.
[447:00.85]No.
[447:02.89]I'm gonna wait.
[447:04.57]So it's bang, this one comes down, and then he comes across.
[447:08.77]Then watch it, he throws it the other way!
[447:10.45]I don't know, I'm so, goddammit, I had it, I'm so, I'm so...
[447:21.11]It's so slow, but I know I'm gonna get hit by it.
[447:38.06]Okay.
[447:39.60]Good.
[447:42.50]Pull the lever.
[447:43.10]Let's get the hell out of here.
[447:52.22]Why is this... There's the other door in the middle here.
[447:59.04]Oh, thank God!
[448:03.25]No, it's not.
[448:03.89]I win.
[448:06.57]Eat shit, game.
[448:19.78]Just give me a save point somewhere.
[448:37.12]I killed Sirius Black!
[448:48.71]What are you doing?
[448:51.34]What are they doing?
[449:02.49]They actually did it.
[449:03.45]I can't believe they did it.
[449:05.27]I can't believe they did it.
[449:06.93]Oh.
[449:07.01]Did they do it again?
[449:23.87]Stop.
[449:25.11]They won't do anything.
[449:26.59]Stupid game.
[449:27.27]This game is dumb.
[449:28.63]I'm almost done.
[449:29.41]Give us your beating heart, or else Dennis is going to be sliced and diced.
[449:36.34]Ron Wilson, forget about me.
[449:39.86]Keep the head down, Ron.
[449:41.72]Dennis.
[449:42.92]Simon.
[449:43.30]Head on the back of the table.
[449:45.24]Leave Dennis or donate your heart to us.
[449:46.86]Stuck in your stomach.
[449:47.70]The clock is ticking.
[449:49.62]Look at him.
[449:50.50]We need an answer.
[449:52.10]Yes.
[449:52.59]What's it to be?
[449:57.28]Do I have to make a choice?
[449:58.32]Well, he's dead anyway.
[450:15.17]You're still playing this shitty game.
[450:16.91]Aww.
[450:25.99]Yeah, hey Ralph and Jemima.
[450:29.73]Yep, the siblings were horrendously cruel by nature and it's said that they were the torturers and executioners during Lord Burroughs' bloody campaign.
[450:36.46]So these are the two serial killers.
[450:39.00]Fascination for blades and in particular scissors, they found endless enjoyment in gutting or dismembering people.
[450:45.22]When Lord Burroughs was killed, Ralph and Jemima were stoned to death by the crowds.
[450:50.12]They were resurrected together and they continued to wreak havoc.
[451:04.18]Hopefully a save point, and then the climax of the game.
[451:07.24]That'd be great.
[451:07.86]Looks like... Just like Grandfather's Room, what's it doing in here?
[451:19.53]I'm losing viewers rapidly.
[451:29.53]Well, it's like... It's...
[451:33.80]It's like fucking one or two o'clock in the morning, and I've been streaming for seven and a half hours.
[451:38.03]It's not out of the ordinary.
[451:43.85]It's like 2.30 a.m.
[451:45.15]Eastern right now.
[451:54.56]What else is even in here?
[451:56.88]Is there really nothing else in here?
[452:10.31]I can't go through there.
[452:15.51]Yeah, I'm in it to win it now.
[452:18.26]I need the closure.
[452:19.22]Somebody just said it.
[452:19.80]I need closure.
[452:27.78]Everything looks just like Grandfather's.
[452:29.30]Looks like Grandfather's.
[452:30.71]Okay, well, apparently I picked up something.
[452:33.15]Well, this is drawings.
[452:33.95]Drawings.
[452:35.36]For Grampy, today I read a book with pretty pictures.
[452:37.72]A wolf pretended to be grandma and ate up a girl.
[452:40.36]It was scary, so I went to Grampy's room because Grampy would save me.
[452:43.44]Grampy is really strong and he can kill a wolf.
[452:45.92]I love my Grampy.
[452:47.92]I'm going to stay with him forever and ever.
[452:55.70]I said that that was the password.
[453:03.83]Who would have thought?
[453:07.14]Alright, Grampy.
[453:08.04]It's time to, like, pull the Wizard of Oz veil.
[453:12.12]And see who the fuck is really behind this.
[453:13.90]A ladder.
[453:16.54]Where does it go?
[453:34.77]Back in the projector room?
[453:44.76]Now what?
[453:51.26]Well, you did that.
[453:52.52]I didn't do that.
[453:54.10]You did that on your own free will.
[454:13.55]Oh, it's me, Grandpa!
[454:14.98]I'm not even going to attempt to do a joke.
[454:18.00]It's too late for that.
[454:18.74]Maybe like six hours ago.
[454:25.26]Lord Burroughs.
[454:27.72]My ancestor.
[454:31.13]Hear me.
[454:33.49]I know of your pain and anger when you lost your beloved daughter, Annabelle.
[454:38.77]Just before the ritual of engagement, my love for Elissa led me to kill her father, Philip.
[454:46.67]Entity, was everything you're doing, is it all because of you?
[454:52.13]Do you want me to resurrect Lord Burrows after 400 years?
[454:56.59]He's just practicing his lines.
[454:58.43]And to enact the ritual of engagement?
[455:01.17]Never mind.
[455:02.66]Is that what you want?
[455:04.44]the local theater in the community is doing a shakespearean
[455:15.90]Well, that doesn't sound bad.
[455:18.75]Once the deed is done, I will be with Alyssa forever.
[455:23.33]Return to this Earth, Lord Burrus.
[455:26.28]Join with me and we will complete the ritual of engagement.
[455:31.18]Enter my body and let our flesh be fused.
[455:37.56]This is all a great kind of climactic ending here, but Ron's still downstairs getting chopped up by a pendulum with the two clowns.
[455:45.43]Are we going to get an ending to that sequence?
[456:02.31]Because I'm the Oogie Boogie Man.
[456:10.11]Make more Tim Burton references, why not.
[456:18.74]Well that was easy, I didn't have to do anything.
[456:24.28]He wanted too much power.
[456:27.93]Oh no, Vigo came out of the painting!
[456:30.75]Now we're fucked.
[456:38.01]Now you know everything, Elissa.
[456:39.33]The one who's after your heart is none other than your grandfather, with the blessing of our own Lord Burroughs.
[456:46.51]Once we have your heart, the two of them will carry out the ritual of engagement, and a new entity will be born.
[456:55.58]Thanks to you, our acts will swell and prosper.
[457:02.39]Well, okay.
[457:03.07]Any more secret buttons?
[457:32.79]Any more things I can do I have to press a little button or something go down leave Last time I pressed a button on the door.
[457:41.10]Why I'm like back in this room.
[457:42.60]I don't get it Not this shit again, how did I get down there before I
[458:03.80]Help me out here.
[458:11.33]Is the bottom right one?
[458:16.19]Is it the bottom right one?
[458:20.69]I can take any of them.
[458:30.03]Can I holy water the knights?
[458:33.73]No.
[458:35.60]I already opened the door, you're right, just go down.
[458:50.05]Shit.
[458:52.67]Can I open it again?
[459:00.75]Oh, no, I have to actually throw the switch again, don't I?
[459:06.95]Oh, fuck.
[459:08.21]Okay, come on, Jeremy.
[459:09.09]You can do this.
[459:09.69]It's getting late.
[459:10.77]Come on.
[459:16.48]You can do it.
[459:16.98]Just do it.
[459:17.98]Don't even think about it.
[459:18.60]Just go.
[459:20.92]I can do it.
[459:21.98]I know I can.
[459:22.52]Just go.
[459:27.76]Jesus Christ.
[459:37.73]Flip the switch.
[459:41.99]Let's do this.
[459:45.04]Let's do this.
[459:49.84]Oh, okay.
[459:56.18]Jerma, finish this game.
[459:57.08]I have a project due.
[459:59.78]Well, that's more important.
[460:00.54]That's more important.
[460:05.71]E3 demo voice.
[460:06.96]Let's do this.
[460:08.66]Okay, you got enough supplies?
[460:11.08]Yeah.
[460:11.94]How you on medkits?
[460:13.68]Radical.
[460:14.46]Yeah, me too.
[460:16.42]Let's do this.
[460:30.93]Do we get a exposition on you?
[460:34.13]Yeah, we do.
[460:38.25]Now Julia.
[460:41.11]Murderer rank seven.
[460:42.73]A minus in social studies.
[460:48.35]She's killed 495 people.
[460:50.35]She belongs in jail for a very long time.
[461:15.55]Scissor Woman.
[461:17.71]Victims 22.
[461:18.21]Wow, not even that impressive.
[461:25.32]The first boss killed more people than you.
[461:27.36]Not even good.
[461:28.16]Okay, watch out for the wind.
[461:43.29]How far does it go up?
[461:46.33]Okay, to the wall Where is she?
[461:53.83]Can I teleport around?
[461:56.05]There she is Okay, what's with the... Jin has Tim Burton music
[462:16.50]Oh, now you're fucked.
[462:19.10]Bingo.
[462:20.36]That did a lot of damage, though.
[462:25.24]Where's the wind coming from?
[462:29.25]Corner?
[462:30.51]She's just spinning in the corner.
[462:37.55]Bingo, right in the head.
[462:39.83]Ooh, I connected!
[462:45.31]Where are you?
[462:52.52]Son of a bitch.
[462:57.68]You were pathetic.
[463:07.45]They're gonna combine... Scissorman shows up and they combine into like... the quad scissor.
[463:26.52]Here we go again.
[463:39.51]Put your hand out.
[463:40.37]Grab it.
[463:41.43]Alright, Scissorman.
[463:45.47]37 victims.
[463:45.99]You guys are really not that impressive.
[463:51.01]You have a little bit more of a health bar, though.
[464:05.21]What do you got for moves?
[464:07.83]You know, I wish you could just run faster.
[464:13.07]At what point do you stop jogging and run as fast as you fucking can?
[464:21.56]You do.
[464:24.20]Oh, that hurt.
[464:32.24]No, this is gonna suck.
[464:33.14]You can already tell.
[464:35.12]This is like the fight.
[464:40.12]Dude, look at how slow and shitty this run is.
[464:43.43]There's not another button I can press.
[464:46.85]Than run like a goddamn fuckin' four-year-old.
[464:48.99]How am I supposed to- Am I supposed to duck?
[465:05.62]I don't have an opportunity to do anything.
[465:09.20]That's the opportunity right here and then you gotta duck.
[465:12.70]No.
[465:16.34]Welp.
[465:20.47]Ducking doesn't work.
[465:21.63]Get it!
[465:28.67]No, I'm gonna die.
[465:34.50]Did he get it?
[465:34.98]No, come on.
[465:35.92]Combo, combo, combo, combo.
[465:38.72]Combo!
[465:43.35]Do it!
[465:44.09]Yes!
[465:45.17]I don't think this is going to kill him, though.
[465:56.05]I'm going to be in deep shit.
[465:56.89]This is not going to kill him.
[466:02.52]He's going to be at like 5% health.
[466:07.03]If it's anything like last time, I gotta be ready.
[466:08.80]What the hell did you do?
[466:39.21]That's not right.
[466:42.82]I thought I was in the middle of it.
[466:45.48]I was assuming it was, you know, going left and right.
[466:50.06]Don't make me fight Scissor Woman.
[466:52.80]Okay, good.
[466:59.23]You gotta catch him when he's doing his super move.
[467:02.23]And you gotta pin him.
[467:07.13]So it's when he goes, here it comes, whatever the hell it is.
[467:16.04]I have a present for you.
[467:17.06]Again.
[467:17.58]I'm in a little bit of trouble.
[467:32.27]Oh, he's going to do it again.
[467:38.60]Attach, attach, attach, attach, attach!
[467:43.81]Do it!
[467:44.89]Yes!
[467:52.85]Alright, I got full health.
[467:58.66]Try to get it to happen again.
[468:17.13]Let's hit him again.
[468:21.99]Hit him again.
[468:26.19]Good night.
[468:30.82]Last one.
[468:31.40]Three, two, one.
[468:34.34]Bye-bye.
[468:43.50]Now you can dodge.
[468:46.70]I thought he was just cutting his arm off.
[469:16.32]You could have waited a half second before running through the blade.
[469:34.71]I'm so glad we will never see those two characters ever again in any form of media.
[469:40.11]Thank you, Dennis.
[469:42.09]Thank you.
[469:43.47]No, thank you.
[469:45.43]Oh no, here comes Merlin!
[470:02.56]That was like Tim and Eric.
[470:03.38]Can you repair the spiral first?
[470:05.96]I have to go, Dennis.
[470:07.98]You stay here.
[470:27.36]What's a ruder?
[471:02.40]Final boss save.
[471:03.44]Let's get... I hope... You know, I usually don't want this and I usually don't like this, but I hope this final boss is just a single arrow cutscene.
[471:12.29]I hope so.
[471:38.21]You gotta go up 16 floors.
[471:43.79]You didn't fix it.
[471:50.76]You didn't fix the... Okay.
[471:54.44]Good.
[472:07.58]Up we go.
[472:08.92]To the final sequence of the game.
[472:13.55]Is this a special arrow?
[472:18.93]I'm calling it right now.
[472:19.71]You're going to rage quit when you get to this boss.
[472:21.47]It's been so long.
[472:25.77]It's been too long.
[472:26.97]It's been an eight hour experience.
[472:28.75]But I'm not going to leave now.
[472:31.77]Why would I stop now?
[472:53.03]Um, lady.
[472:55.86]Okay, that works too.
[472:57.50]That's fine.
[472:59.27]That's not how I would have done it, but that's how you're gonna do it.
[473:24.43]Item or something?
[473:25.79]Nothing?
[473:26.13]No items?
[473:27.83]No?
[473:28.43]Alright.
[473:31.27]Here we go.
[473:37.26]I don't want to make another Ocarina of Time reference, but this is the Ganon fight.
[473:40.42]I'm going to go and fight him on the roof.
[473:53.80]Ocarina, what am I, how am I saying it wrong?
[473:58.88]It's the, it's the Ocarina.
[474:01.50]Ocarina.
[474:05.68]Aquarina.
[474:07.28]No, it's the Ocarina.
[474:08.56]The Ocarina.
[474:18.34]Ocarina.
[474:19.98]Ocarina.
[474:28.09]Akarina?
[474:32.76]Aquafina!
[474:40.62]Can I not pull that?
[474:47.59]Can you do this?
[474:51.07]Can I pull- There's a strain- I tried to- I pressed it every second!
[475:03.38]Here's the sequence.
[475:06.22]We're gonna go all the way up.
[475:10.36]I just lived my entire life and died and Jerma's still playing Clocktower.
[475:16.06]Uh, you- you- I welcome the first ever mosquito to watching Jerma985.
[475:23.59]Fucking crane fly.
[475:24.75]Whatever you are.
[475:34.53]This game sucks, by the way.
[475:53.96]Next game?
[475:54.82]There is no next game tonight.
[475:56.82]We've been going for eight hours.
[475:57.88]There's gonna be a next game tomorrow.
[476:16.33]What happened?
[476:17.35]Oh.
[476:23.25]It is tomorrow.
[476:23.99]Well, I mean, later today.
[476:24.91]Fuck, it is tomorrow.
[476:26.45]No, it's not.
[476:26.84]It's 1147.
[476:27.12]12 hours of Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[476:39.09]No.
[476:50.15]Grandpa, your ass is on fire.
[476:58.08]What?
[476:58.48]Oh shit!
[477:00.52]It's burning!
[477:02.98]In order to become one with you, I searched and searched for three years, and at last I found it.
[477:12.28]Borough's castle used to stand in exactly the same spot where the Hamilton house is now.
[477:20.22]It's not a coincidence.
[477:22.56]It's all the entities doing.
[477:25.94]This is our destiny.
[477:29.06]Grandpa!
[477:31.88]Don't look so sad.
[477:34.91]Once the ritual of engagement is complete, you and I will become a new entity.
[477:40.93]We'll be engaged.
[477:41.98]This is just creepy.
[477:43.62]Grandpa wants to marry the granddaughter.
[477:49.66]I've got a ring for you, too.
[477:52.20]We have vows to say.
[477:53.36]Grandpa, you're fucked.
[478:14.34]Oh no, she's stoned.
[478:17.72]Nancy betrayed me more than that.
[478:20.16]She married that weak, lily-livered, good-for-nothing Philip.
[478:23.90]And then she tried to prevent me from becoming one with my most precious granddaughter.
[478:29.83]That's why she's there.
[478:31.13]There was no other way, Alyssa.
[478:33.75]Damn you!
[478:35.25]You're not my grandfather.
[478:36.41]I don't know who you are anymore.
[478:38.69]But I know that I'm a ruder.
[478:41.45]I'll destroy you and save my mother.
[478:44.11]Fool.
[478:45.53]Fool.
[478:47.17]Fool.
[478:50.49]He just iPad RPG evolved three times.
[478:54.79]He's like a five star now.
[478:56.03]It only took $6,000 and 2,000 hours of playtime to have it happen.
[479:12.56]Now, Alyssa, time to lie down on the altar and prepare to surrender your heart to me!
[479:30.29]It's Ron!
[479:30.91]Alyssa!
[479:31.85]Where are you, Alyssa?
[479:33.21]Alyssa!
[479:35.25]Dennis!
[479:35.99]Alyssa!
[479:41.19]Dennis, get up here, you dope.
[479:43.61]What are you, dope?
[479:57.66]Oh, the final piece.
[480:00.50]Dennis, get it.
[480:05.32]Get it before Captain Hook kills me!
[480:07.45]He looks like a cereal mascot.
[480:32.86]Oh, the captain's crumbled.
[480:34.18]We're almost done.
[480:40.91]I'm so glad.
[480:43.03]Captain Morgan.
[480:48.03]Dennis, get up here.
[480:50.09]The time has come at last.
[480:52.29]My dearest Alyssa, merge into one entity with me so that we can be together forever.
[481:05.91]What?
[481:06.70]What happened?
[481:09.24]That was way too fast.
[481:18.62]Oops.
[481:30.63]Ah, Captain.
[481:32.03]Always good to see... Ron's dead.
[481:34.01]See you later, Ron.
[481:42.83]Final one-shot arrow.
[481:44.19]Come on, I turned into Kid Icarus.
[481:51.28]Lord Burrows.
[481:54.10]Only 115 people.
[481:55.42]You ruled for like 50,000 years.
[482:00.20]That's impossible.
[482:00.86]He's 2,200 years and he's only... That's more years than people.
[482:08.17]Alright, he has like a slime...
[482:24.08]Oh, he's doing the same thing.
[482:27.44]We're both doing the same move.
[482:29.30]Uh-oh.
[482:38.49]He's doing my own move on me.
[482:42.99]He got a nuke.
[482:47.59]Well, it was, uh... We had some fun.
[482:55.15]Just step to the left!
[482:57.11]Dennis eviscerated.
[483:32.95]What?
[483:33.21]Dennis?
[483:33.79]What about me?
[483:36.13]Alright, so I can't get three.
[483:37.33]This is gonna be weird.
[483:38.93]I'm gonna have to shoot him with something.
[483:41.36]He's got two health bars.
[483:42.44]This is gonna suck.
[484:01.85]He's getting closer.
[484:06.89]Damn it!
[484:10.01]Shoot that!
[484:11.51]I'm dead.
[484:12.73]What's wrong with him?
[484:15.06]Good thing I just dodged that accidentally.
[484:17.96]Alright, I'm good.
[484:25.32]Here we go!
[484:30.48]My turn!
[484:38.87]Let it go.
[484:40.43]Why would you hold on that long?
[484:42.53]Come on.
[485:14.24]Super.
[485:14.52]Hit him with the whole thing.
[485:15.20]The whole thing!
[485:16.68]Bingo.
[485:32.39]Come here!
[485:37.11]Do it!
[485:38.77]Yes!
[485:42.15]Oh!
[485:44.72]That's gonna take it down to one full bar.
[485:46.53]How do you fast forward a stream?
[485:52.87]Uh, you can't.
[485:53.35]It's live content, man.
[485:54.85]It's live!
[485:55.49]That's my turn.
[486:05.60]Um, huh?
[486:06.90]What is... I didn't know he had that move.
[486:21.35]He's gonna do it again!
[486:21.99]Fuck!
[486:22.29]Move!
[486:23.57]Oh no!
[486:33.37]Fuck!
[486:33.57]He's gonna do it again!
[486:34.29]How many times does he do that shit?
[486:50.98]Oh no.
[486:52.62]No?
[486:54.06]What?
[486:55.93]Oh no, this is bad!
[487:14.55]What are you falling down for?
[487:16.53]Why did I fall down twice?
[487:19.05]Why did I fall down twice in a row?
[487:22.47]That was ridiculous.
[487:30.17]Dip fell down twice in a row.
[487:32.30]The girl that can't stand on her two goddamn feet for the entire video game.
[487:45.32]Oh, I fell over!
[487:46.62]I fell over again!
[487:48.77]Count how many times I fell over this game.
[487:54.19]I probably fell down just walking two miles per hour.
[487:57.25]685 times.
[488:15.51]Such a klutz.
[488:26.98]It's like her shoes.
[488:28.10]She's wearing tap shoes with oil on the bottoms of them.
[488:43.90]What happens if he gets that close?
[488:48.90]I didn't dodge it.
[488:51.69]Okay, so if he gets that close... Okay, can I please get away from you?
[489:08.53]Now he's powered up.
[489:13.03]Now he's throwing two balls at the same time.
[489:25.58]Can I get fucking Dennis back?
[489:38.83]Can he throw me like a second ring?
[489:43.54]I just want to die.
[489:45.24]Just fucking kill me.
[489:49.15]Hey, Dennis, go into your cereal box and get me another ring.
[489:52.65]Because this one ain't going anywhere.
[490:04.34]Just kill me.
[490:06.06]Such a sweet girl.
[490:19.13]Just do it!
[490:20.67]Just do it!
[490:21.43]I'm standing here waiting for you to do it.
[490:33.68]Why don't you get new attacks?
[490:36.98]Because this is the third game of the Clocktower series, and running away from scary monsters, they had to add some other stuff.
[490:44.89]And they added a bow and arrow.
[490:48.51]That shoots magical bows.
[490:50.15]I can't even... I'm... Here we go.
[490:52.29]I'm beating it right now.
[490:56.24]You had to fucking do that.
[491:43.07]This is so dumb.
[491:44.61]I feel like I'm playing Space Channel again.
[491:59.00]Cheese strat discovered.
[492:00.00]I'm gonna use it all day.
[492:16.09]Alright, I got another health bar to deal with.
[492:22.01]Keep him all the way back there.
[492:25.33]You idiot!
[492:26.23]No, no, no, no!
[492:28.96]No, he's gonna do it again!
[492:34.18]I can't, I'm tethered!
[492:35.02]I'm tethered!
[492:38.14]Thank God, thank you.
[493:01.88]You dumb game.
[493:18.41]I seriously hate that.
[493:20.63]I hate it.
[493:22.05]What does that mean?
[493:54.23]No, I'm not!
[494:06.68]Don't even think about it, you bastard!
[494:26.53]I'm hurting him?
[494:40.85]I gotta move out of the way.
[494:45.01]Other side.
[494:45.40]Walk in front of it.
[494:47.72]Stupid.
[495:19.86]Come on!
[495:21.04]Not gonna have enough time.
[496:11.84]Can't hit him.
[496:14.02]He's walking.
[496:19.80]He's walking!
[496:20.40]No, please!
[496:21.67]Hahaha.
[497:18.36]Dammit.
[497:25.10]Bad angle.
[497:26.13]I gotta move.
[497:32.69]Nooooo!
[498:12.47]Not gonna move!
[498:15.79]This way.
[498:20.67]Back around.
[498:21.09]Oh, the stupid casket!
[498:29.71]Not yet!
[498:45.52]No!
[498:48.85]No, I went too far!
[498:49.83]Please be despawned.
[498:57.27]Yes, there is.
[499:00.63]You... Oh, this is insanity!
[499:11.02]Come on!
[499:12.52]I can't... Look at how slow she runs!
[499:18.58]You're killing me with this bullshit!
[499:49.26]Ah yeah, can you stop doing that shit.
[500:00.04]YES!
[500:32.15]Gotta do it.
[500:37.53]That didn't hit him?
[500:39.25]In what world?
[500:41.87]In what fucking reality did that not hit him?
[500:45.39]There's no escape!
[500:48.11]Ready to give up now?
[500:53.17]There's no escape!
[501:36.91]I need to get it!
[502:08.84]See you in hell!
[502:10.28]See you in hell!
[502:10.88]That was fucking horrible!
[502:15.60]Oh, that was horrible!
[502:21.53]The fight's not hard, it just lasts so long!
[502:23.73]It's like a World of Warcraft boss, you just have to do everything over and over again.
[502:31.95]For like ten minutes.
[502:32.99]My dearest Andy, sir.
[502:37.72]You always were a spirited child.
[502:41.68]But that's enough.
[502:43.22]Did you have to look?
[502:44.84]What was the picture for?
[502:50.71]What's the matter, Alyssa?
[502:52.61]Does that mean remembering a photo of him?
[502:54.39]He's right in front of me.
[502:55.35]For all eternity?
[503:03.84]Look at those eyes.
[503:06.36]Oh my god, Alyssa takes strength from me.
[503:10.30]Phase 2.
[503:10.64]Um... Is the game broken?
[503:32.73]Lisa is growing up into a- There's no escape!
[503:35.78]She is everything to me.
[503:37.62]And I wish for nothing more- Why were we getting the opening cutscene in the game?
[503:55.97]Give up, Grandfather.
[503:58.15]I won't allow the ritual to happen.
[504:02.09]Are we gonna have to sword fight now in phase three?
[504:07.13]He passes Dennis on the way down.
[504:49.26]And so ends Clock Towers.
[504:51.88]Is there another Clock Tower game after this?
[504:54.54]It can't be, right?
[504:55.10]The whole tower comes down.
[505:05.09]Who cares There are some spiritual successors, okay
[505:42.27]We didn't have time to mourn Ron.
[505:47.59]It was all a dream.
[505:52.27]How satisfied are you right now?
[505:53.51]I'm pretty satisfied.
[505:59.01]I stuck to my guns, and I completed Clock Tower 3.
[506:01.81]I didn't think I was gonna do that.
[506:04.09]After the second boss, I was about to stop, but... I feel accomplished.
[506:11.22]In a not-at-all sort of way.
[506:13.82]Am I dead?
[506:16.70]What did we do?
[506:42.90]We did it.
[506:43.30]I think we're in all- we all made it to heaven.
[507:06.19]You got one out of eighteen endings.
[507:08.93]Where would the other endings come from?
[507:12.70]Ron didn't make it to heaven that's actually kind of unfortunate that's really bad that's so awful
[507:43.56]Ron's the main character of the next game she didn't really seem to miss him she didn't even know he was gone Ron was the reason why we were able to even win in the first place he threw the magical lucky charm up at me without Ron there is no win you don't win I was about to get sacrificed to like the demon god
[508:22.85]Library program?
[508:23.91]Alright, let's see.
[508:27.17]Is there an after-credits scene?
[508:36.00]Original concept movie product.
[508:47.35]What movie?
[509:03.69]Why don't you just leave in the beginning and he wouldn't have been able to become the entity either way since you would not be there for the sacrifice.
[509:12.73]Yeah.
[509:20.18]Clock Tower 3 received mixed or average reviews with an aggregate score of 69 out of 100.
[509:34.49]It was still enjoyable.
[509:35.53]Alright, look.
[509:37.61]The game was all over the place, but it was still... It was messy fun.
[509:42.21]It was messy fun.
[509:46.16]No, it was not.
[509:47.14]Yeah, it was.
[509:48.96]I wouldn't give it a positive rating.
[509:53.12]I'd say it was messy fun.
[510:04.30]But those of you that are leaving, we're going to kind of wind it down here.
[510:08.22]And I will see you tomorrow for... Oh, yeah, what's that?
[510:13.90]Oh, a bunch of other PlayStation 2 games that I didn't do today that I was supposed to do instead of eight and a half hours of Clock Tower 3.
[510:25.33]So I'll see you tomorrow.
[510:32.61]Why did you do this?
[510:33.73]I had fun.
[510:35.39]I just had to do it.
[510:36.31]I had to.
[510:36.81]So, I'll see you tomorrow.
[510:45.81]Starting probably around the same time.
[510:48.17]Between, like, 3 and 4.
[510:49.29]Gonna do PS2 games for a month at this rate.
[510:56.10]No, we're gonna go back to, like, we'll play some jokey ones.
[511:00.83]I don't know how much longer I can be in some of these.
[511:04.05]And then we're going to go back to VR next week.
[511:10.71]Alright, we're almost there.
[511:25.23]But this game was a joke.
[511:26.59]Yeah, but it turned into a thing of not a...
[511:30.87]know you got me there but it's still I I had I had I enjoyed myself to a point where I was able to I wanted to beat it starter's joke turned into an ordeal that's right
[511:58.19]We could barely hear you over the game the whole stream.
[512:00.77]Is that true?
[512:03.91]Was it that loud?
[512:04.75]And what the fuck was that noise?
[512:21.98]Rooters points, 40,000.
[512:31.98]A new element has been unlocked.
[512:34.42]We have to see what it is.
[512:48.93]So what was the element that I unlocked?
[512:55.65]This game includes disturbing content and scenes of graphic violence.
[512:58.43]Yes, it does.
[513:00.99]40,000 points out of a possible 20 billion.
[513:06.71]Okay.
[513:08.35]Produced by Capcom, right?
[513:10.99]What's the new element?
[513:15.64]Theater.
[513:20.24]Just watch the cutscenes again?
[513:21.42]Is that the new element?
[513:27.49]Yeah.
[513:29.80]It's just a gallery.
[513:33.68]OK.
[513:34.26]It's a weird way to transition to that.
[513:42.00]OK, here's some concept art.
[513:47.76]Cool.
[513:48.02]Is this the house?
[513:59.83]3D model of the house.
[514:11.86]Uh, that didn't happen.
[514:14.56]They must have got rid of that part.
[514:35.12]The Art of Clock Tower 3.
[514:38.70]Bye!
[514:48.54]Alright.
[514:49.56]That's gonna be it.
[514:50.98]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[514:53.48]I'm gonna go over the bits.
[514:59.70]Thanks for sticking around as long as some of you did.
[515:03.61]Uh, we went pretty late with this one, but that's okay.
[515:12.55]Let us move on to the bits.
[515:13.57]Gonna move this, change that.
[515:19.68]See you tomorrow if you're leaving.
[515:22.18]We'll do some more PS2 stuff.
[515:25.16]And then we're gonna take a break for a couple days, come back with VR.
[515:35.31]talk about that tomorrow starting back a while ago we had nine hours ago it seems like an entire day which it kind of is uh some guy gave 15 thank you for the 15 bucks some guy
[515:54.53]Been a while since I last donated, but that's mostly because I'd otherwise have fucked up my sleep rhythm due to non-EU-friendly times.
[516:01.53]Jeremiah Pluto.
[516:02.25]Anyway, here's a meme video.
[516:03.52]Okay.
[516:04.88]It's gonna be Phantom of the Opera.
[516:05.98]Three, two, one.
[516:07.34]Actually, I can't hear it.
[516:10.66]Hold on.
[516:13.80]It's called Ring-A-Ding.
[516:15.14]Hold on.
[516:15.58]I gotta change this.
[516:21.43]Ring-A-Ding?
[516:25.58]What is going on in this video It's like the guy
[516:54.78]I don't know what that is.
[516:57.39]There's a guy running around with, like, a bell.
[517:00.53]Well, thank you for the $15, some guy.
[517:02.75]And that was very, very loud.
[517:08.19]Thank you, though.
[517:09.55]Thank you, Divvis, for the $2.50.
[517:10.81]Thank you, uh, S. Kink.
[517:15.20]For the... Ah, I'm supposed to be doing $2.50.
[517:17.66]What am I doing?
[517:19.46]But thank you.
[517:19.94]Thank you, Dorkube, for the $4.00.
[517:23.34]Didn't even watch the video.
[517:24.64]I'm too lazy to click on it.
[517:27.84]What's the point of that video?
[517:29.00]I don't know.
[517:32.32]DoorCube, thanks for the $4.
[517:35.38]So my brother wasn't able to propose to his girlfriend last week due to some complications, but he got it today and it went swimmingly and didn't mix up the ring with his sunflower seed holder.
[517:46.16]Gotta be careful not to do that.
[517:48.16]I was told a few months ago that I need to be more careful with the things that I say to people and the objects that I carry around with me.
[517:57.95]I didn't... I gotta talk.
[518:02.35]I don't know what the problem is, but... Good to hear.
[518:06.41]Congratulations to them, by the way.
[518:10.06]Thank you for the $4.
[518:15.51]Really appreciate it.
[518:16.05]DoorCube, 700,000 games.
[518:17.17]Oh, my God.
[518:20.63]Noob gave 10 community subs.
[518:22.03]Thank you.
[518:28.47]What are you guys doing?
[518:31.27]Why is everybody doing, like, question marks?
[518:39.24]What is question marks?
[518:49.87]He doesn't know.
[518:50.57]Oh, I don't know.
[518:51.25]I don't know what you guys are doing.
[518:53.49]But thank you for the $4, DoorCube.
[518:55.45]Thank you, Flugboy, for the $3.
[518:56.41]Hope you're doing well tonight.
[518:58.61]I wanted to ask, since I strive to be able to do some of the voices you can do, can you do a snake voice well?
[519:04.16]And also, while watching this, my friend said he sounds like he's really trying to entertain himself playing this game.
[519:11.00]I cannot do a solid snake.
[519:14.05]It's one of the many things I cannot do.
[519:16.73]But, I mean, yeah.
[519:18.59]The game was fun.
[519:23.97]Snake from Harry Potter?
[519:25.83]No, that's Snape.
[519:28.41]But thank you, Flugboy.
[519:29.41]I cannot do a snake.
[519:36.71]Thank you, Nate, for the $6.
[519:39.27]Streamer fails to finish and beat Cartoon Game.
[519:41.29]I did.
[519:41.85]I beat it.
[519:42.73]Clocktower 3.
[519:48.45]Thank you, though, for the $6, Nate.
[519:51.77]Neon, thank you.
[519:52.81]Thank you.
[519:55.55]Also, thank you to Mad Pharaoh.
[519:59.49]Mad Pharaoh.
[520:00.57]For the $9.
[520:00.83]No music.
[520:04.25]Shit.
[520:06.37]Thank you.
[520:07.95]Thank you for telling me that.
[520:09.01]Thank you, Mad Pharaoh, for $9.
[520:10.85]No message here.
[520:11.81]Just $9.
[520:12.11]Thank you.
[520:13.03]That's a lot of money.
[520:16.66]Flank Tank, thanks for 10 bucks.
[520:19.40]Sorry I've missed the last couple of streams, but catching up watching the VODs, and you said you might go back to newer games this week.
[520:25.74]Sorry to do this again.
[520:27.32]I know I've been beating a dead horse with a broken record telling you to play Nier Automata, but since the new complete version comes out Tuesday, hearing you might play new games made me Omega jermaVenus.
[520:41.01]I probably won't be playing it anytime soon.
[520:43.72]So I will not be playing Nier Automata anytime soon.
[520:50.81]Maybe some other time.
[520:52.45]I don't know.
[520:53.73]I have no plan.
[520:54.33]I have no plan to play it.
[520:55.95]Let's put it that way.
[521:04.51]But I am going to be going back to some newer stuff.
[521:06.43]And by newer, I mean stuff that at least is things that have come out in the last year or two.
[521:14.45]Because we're going to go back to Vive.
[521:16.35]And I want to do Mindshow.
[521:19.37]I would assume we're going to spend more than one stream in Mindshow.
[521:27.49]Because I kind of want to make a bunch of random shit.
[521:31.71]We'll see.
[521:34.69]Launch Day Sekiro?
[521:35.75]Probably.
[521:36.15]I can't imagine why I wouldn't.
[521:43.91]But I knew he means Game Boy.
[521:47.05]But thank you, Flank Tank, for the ten bucks.
[521:49.33]Dr. Doobers, thanks for the $2.50.
[521:50.47]Nate, thanks for the $2.50.
[521:56.23]Jerma, so if you love Half-Life, answer me this question.
[521:58.65]In Half-Life 2, who are the Rebels and Gordon Freeman fighting the Combine?
[522:02.75]That's it.
[522:03.97]Hopefully that made you happy.
[522:06.47]Ludus, thanks for the $5.50.
[522:09.67]Are you a voice actor for the engineer in the game Gunhead?
[522:12.72]I am.
[522:17.35]I am the voice of the engineer in that game.
[522:19.55]Gunhead.
[522:20.01]No, wait.
[522:22.15]No, no, that's a lie.
[522:22.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[522:23.35]Cryptark.
[522:24.27]Cryptark.
[522:25.61]Wait, no, no, no.
[522:26.11]That's the same thing, right?
[522:31.33]Isn't Gunhead this, like, they made, like, another version of it, right?
[522:40.97]They did, like, essentially a first-person version of Cryptark, right?
[522:51.19]Doesn't even know his own damn role.
[522:55.01]First impression.
[522:56.99]It's been eight and a half hours.
[522:58.03]Come on, give us some slack.
[523:05.89]Forgets the hundreds of roles he's had in games.
[523:08.30]No, not hundreds.
[523:10.26]Who hired this idiot?
[523:13.72]But I'm the engineer in CryptArk.
[523:18.48]Which also, I'm assuming they took the lines from Cryptark and put it in Gunhead.
[523:22.48]I didn't play Gunhead.
[523:23.24]Maybe I'll have to look at it.
[523:31.35]But thank you, Ludus Oak, for the $5.50.
[523:34.45]Did I finish the game?
[523:35.37]I did.
[523:36.33]I beat Clocktower 3 in one sitting.
[523:45.87]Hey, Freudian weapon, thanks for the $4.31.
[523:48.90]I don't mean to be a tattletale, but I think Shido's up to no good again.
[523:51.76]He's got this mischievous look on his face.
[524:02.20]Calvin.
[524:03.50]Calvin and Hobbes.
[524:04.30]That's like on the back of people's cars.
[524:06.62]Isn't that... Yeah, that's like one of the ones that's on the back of people's windshields.
[524:16.40]Yeah, the peeing one.
[524:17.66]You know, that's not even from a Calvin.
[524:20.02]Somebody made that up.
[524:25.54]Like, Calvin doesn't, like, take a piss on a wall somewhere in any of those comics.
[524:30.12]Somebody, like, did that.
[524:31.06]That's not an officially licensed piece of merchandise.
[524:42.43]But thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $4.31.
[524:47.54]Uh, thank you, Nate, for the five dollars here.
[524:49.76]You're gonna finish Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[524:53.00]Uh, I'm not going to.
[524:55.22]I will not be finishing Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[524:56.70]It was an interesting game, but we had to move on.
[525:00.21]Thank you.
[525:01.19]Thank you, Djack!
[525:03.77]Thank you.
[525:05.81]Uh, we had 250 coming from Nate again.
[525:10.13]But I played the orange box on my PS3.
[525:11.83]I don't even think it works.
[525:14.00]Does TF2 still even have servers on the orange box?
[525:18.63]For, like, PlayStation?
[525:19.59]Is the server still up?
[525:26.08]Isn't there still, like, a crit bug in the game that hasn't been patched since, like, 2008?
[525:33.20]Can't you charge up a melee crit in the orange box version on the console?
[525:42.13]There's still a bunch of old vanilla bugs.
[525:46.35]But I played thousands and thousands and thousands of hours of the Orange Box.
[525:50.65]I will probably not be going back and playing it anytime soon.
[525:54.21]Or probably, you know, probably never again.
[525:57.41]Unless there's some reason why I would play Portal again.
[526:01.52]I've beat that game like three times.
[526:03.72]Half-Life 2, that game I'm not going to go back to.
[526:07.52]TF2, I mean, it's still there.
[526:09.50]It's still available.
[526:10.44]I don't have like a reason to go back and play it.
[526:13.80]But if they do something cool or bigger or larger, add some interesting things.
[526:18.40]I played it like a year and a half ago.
[526:21.28]But I don't really have a reason to play them.
[526:24.10]I've already done all these things more than once.
[526:27.38]So going back and doing it again is just like, hey, I'm doing it again.
[526:31.97]I don't really have a reason to do it.
[526:36.53]Especially something like Portal or Half-Life.
[526:42.05]Would not be playing those games probably again.
[526:47.65]Thank you, TheOtherUs, for the two bucks.
[526:50.35]Uh-oh!
[526:50.77]This is going to take some getting used to.
[526:57.70]But thank you.
[527:00.82]I need that story.
[527:01.48]What are you talking about?
[527:04.22]Tell me a story.
[527:04.66]I need a story.
[527:05.20]Stop stalling.
[527:05.80]What story am I talking about?
[527:07.02]What are you talking about?
[527:07.86]I'm supposed to tell a story?
[527:17.74]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[527:25.62]Alright, I got a story for you.
[527:27.26]Go to bed.
[527:28.65]The end.
[527:30.57]That's a pretty good one.
[527:39.37]Okay, goodnight.
[527:47.38]I didn't like that story.
[527:54.91]How am I supposed to sleep after that?
[528:01.59]But thank you, TheOtherUs.
[528:03.55]Uh, thank you, Nate, again for three bucks.
[528:05.25]So in Jerma Rumble, can you feature one of the Eds?
[528:08.68]They're all gonna be one character.
[528:09.74]It's gonna be a monstrosity.
[528:11.66]It's gonna be all three of their faces.
[528:13.12]So they don't take up three slots.
[528:17.66]Thank you, Nate, again, for the $2.50.
[528:19.50]Guess who's back?
[528:20.30]Back again.
[528:21.16]Tell a friend.
[528:21.62]Guess who's back?
[528:23.00]Uh, guess who's back?
[528:23.58]You're gonna get copyrighted by M&M.
[528:24.84]Uh, I don't think I will.
[528:28.70]Probably not.
[528:29.08]I don't think so.
[528:31.89]But thank you, Nate, for the $2.50.
[528:32.69]Uh, Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[528:36.85]Even though games like this suck, in quotes, they're somehow oddly lovable and hard to put down because you just want to complete the game.
[528:44.23]Yeah, it's bad, but you just can't help yourself.
[528:47.85]Anyways, here's a little of my tax return money.
[528:49.73]Hope you did your taxes.
[528:50.83]Have a good night.
[528:51.45]Jerma in chat.
[528:53.69]My taxes are good.
[528:57.43]Taxes are good to go.
[528:59.93]Thank you.
[529:01.65]And thanks for the $2.50.
[529:03.33]And yes, there is something to be said.
[529:08.54]It's just the cutscenes were just so out of control.
[529:10.80]There was so much weird shit going on.
[529:12.24]I just needed to know what else there was.
[529:20.27]Tuck me into bed.
[529:21.31]Alright, now you're just getting weird.
[529:22.40]I don't know.
[529:30.90]I don't have a response to that one.
[529:34.25]But thank you, Nate, for the three, four, five, six, seven, eight dollars and fifty cents.
[529:40.05]Now this looks like a job for me, so chat, follow me.
[529:42.63]Alright, it's more M&M.
[529:45.46]And then they say, when the cutscenes are better than the gameplay, uh, by the way, that man is, why is that man guard wearing a shirt?
[529:54.89]Wait, what are you talking about?
[529:56.47]Oh, no, it's, I don't know.
[530:02.85]Ban the guy with the M&M lyrics?
[530:05.32]Which one?
[530:12.28]Nate another like another like eight dollars from Nate with more slim shady Eminem lyrics Wonderful great.
[530:25.43]Thank you for the Eminem lyrics And then they say well Jerma two clowns do exist it's the Joker and Harley Quinn those two have a lot of fan art They're pretty popular the Joker and Harley Quinn.
[530:39.01]I
[530:42.27]I mean, yeah, they are very popular characters.
[530:44.49]Imagine if I was like, nah, Joker ain't that popular.
[530:56.20]Joker and Harley Quinn aren't popular at all.
[531:01.44]But thank you.
[531:04.09]Thank you again for the 250, Nate.
[531:05.55]Well, there's my proof Jerma can't suck it up and beat Cartoon Network game.
[531:09.44]The easiest game of all time.
[531:10.86]I mean, you're probably gonna do the same with SpongeBob.
[531:15.18]Is that really that big of a deal that I'm not gonna play through Ed, Edd, and Eddy?
[531:23.67]What the hell is going on?
[531:30.19]I'm not gonna play through all of Ed, Edd, and Eddy the Misadventures.
[531:39.66]I played it for like three hours!
[531:48.14]Why would I need to do that?
[531:58.39]Alright.
[531:59.89]For the amount of people that are telling me, yes, I should... Do you see how many people during that stream were telling me, please God, do anything else?
[532:13.23]I was fighting off animals during that stream.
[532:20.93]I had like my broomstick and I'm just like in the corner like fucking god damn they're coming after me.
[532:30.58]But no.
[532:32.82]I will not be finishing Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[532:37.18]But I am going to finish the, uh... Clock Tower.
[532:42.06]Because that was something I just wanted to do.
[532:47.94]But, thank you to Nate for the Slim Shady lyrics.
[532:51.26]And the $3.
[532:52.90]For all luck, thanks for $5.
[532:56.67]Uh, hey mate, here's $5.
[532:57.37]Sorry for not donating in a while.
[533:00.39]You don't have to be.
[533:01.41]You don't have to apologize for not donating, man.
[533:05.35]That's something I really hope you do not feel sorry for.
[533:12.42]Do not feel sorry for that.
[533:17.52]You giving me $5 is more than enough that I could ever ask anyone to ever give me for money on a stream.
[533:25.79]Don't ever apologize for it.
[533:27.35]Please.
[533:30.41]Thank you for the $5.
[533:30.97]Thanks for hanging out.
[533:40.56]Thank you something or other for the $2.50.
[533:41.94]Oh, nice stream.
[533:44.92]Dude, they laugh really, really hard.
[533:47.44]Let me show you how many times they laugh.
[533:48.78]Look at this.
[533:52.64]No, that's the wrong link.
[533:53.46]Hold on.
[533:56.47]I can just type it.
[534:00.19]Wait a minute.
[534:00.79]They said nice stream.
[534:02.41]Then that.
[534:08.85]That's a lot of ha ha ha's.
[534:14.07]But thank you, Nate, for the two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, more, nine more dollars.
[534:21.86]Thank you, Nate.

[534:38.13]I don't remember.
[534:39.77]I remember the brains.
[534:41.35]The floating, like, egg sacs.
[534:45.15]It's been a while since I played it.
[534:52.85]And then they say, go on, offer up and sell me the game for two cents.
[534:56.62]I'm not gonna, no, I'm not gonna get rid of it, I'm gonna hold onto it for a while.
[535:07.56]I'll probably donate it that's what I typically do once once a year or so a lot of the games that I buy and play I donate so that's what will probably happen but thank you for the 10 bucks here Nate
[535:33.20]And finally here at the end, we had Dingastown.

[536:02.41]FusionFall Retro.
[536:05.29]Where do you donate games?
[536:06.12]There are a lot of places that take video games.
[536:11.56]A lot of the... There's a lot of donation pickups that take them.
[536:21.59]That's usually where I do it.
[536:22.57]I put them all... I get them all nice and neat, get them in a box, and do a drop-off.
[536:29.51]Or a pick-up.
[536:34.88]And then right at the end here, Nate for $3, this is the Half-Life 2 beta boss showed on stream.
[536:42.42]Alright, can I like ban Half-Life, the word, from my stream?
[536:48.99]Can I, is there like a phrase I can ban?
[536:58.85]Donate the Vive.
[536:59.76]I mean, I'm still using the Vive.

[538:14.01]And tomorrow is technically today.
[538:15.33]So it's later today.

[538:33.76]Just gotta make it, heat it up.
[538:40.01]The story has to be great for me to sub.
[538:44.02]I don't have a story to tell you.
[538:46.56]A story?
[538:47.34]I'm... My brain is like scrambled fucking eggs right now.
[538:53.82]I can't... You know, it's been nine straight hours.
[538:56.04]You want me to come up with a story?
[538:58.38]One day, there was a prince.
[539:00.96]And the prince...
[539:03.22]What's the entire plot?
[539:05.78]Just pretend I just did that voice and gave you the whole plot for The Prince and the Pauper from Disney when Mickey Mouse, the two Mickey Mouses.
[539:11.79]What, by the way, what the hell, what was that bullshit?
[539:14.75]First time, when, there was two Mickey Mouses in that movie.
[539:19.21]When have they ever done that again?
[539:20.15]Tell them the clock tower story.
[539:28.71]Hey, Nate, thanks for the three bucks, Nate.
[539:30.17]They just say Half-Life with a smiley face.
[539:40.15]I appreciate your enthusiasm for that series.
[539:42.78]Thank you.
[539:48.36]Not good enough.
[539:48.92]Try again tomorrow.
[539:49.90]Sorry, idiot.
[539:54.96]Hey, will you relax?
[539:58.92]You gotta relax.
[540:05.47]I won't be able to sleep because of you.
[540:11.61]Hey, well, my sleep schedule's gonna be screwed up too, isn't it?
[540:22.01]It's 1 a.m.
[540:23.01]I'll probably get to bed around... I'm gonna eat.
[540:25.77]Still want, uh... I still want... What the fuck is this?
[540:34.99]What on Earth is this?
[540:42.02]Uh, Nate just linked me this, this, I don't even know what this is.
[540:48.66]It's still in the chat, it's right there.
[540:51.82]It's $3.50, I made this for you, please look and laugh.
[540:59.73]Are you putting Ed, Edd n Eddy misadventures in the trash?
[541:02.17]Is that what they're doing?
[541:03.97]I didn't do that, I didn't say that.
[541:14.27]Had nothing to do with me.
[541:19.67]And we did just cross the nine hour mark.
[541:21.59]So I'm gonna get out of here.
[541:23.45]I gotta go.
[541:26.91]Five bucks from Nate.
[541:27.93]That's what you're currently doing.
[541:30.83]Thank you for the five dollars, Nate.
[541:31.91]And I'm gonna have it for a little while.
[541:35.27]And then I'm gonna donate it.
[541:37.43]And someone is gonna get to love that game.
[541:40.29]That experience.
[541:41.05]They're gonna get to play it.
[541:49.89]Remember when 9-hour streams were a rarity?
[541:51.69]Uh, they still are.
[541:55.14]They still are.
[542:03.76]Typically, I'm usually done around, what, 6 to 8 hours usually now?
[542:10.09]Before it was about 4 to 6.
[542:11.49]Now it's about 6 to 8.
[542:12.29]Going over 8.5 to 9 is still pretty rare.
[542:24.28]Go raid, uh, go raid Vinny?
[542:26.53]Is Vinny streaming right now?
[542:27.91]What's he doing?
[542:30.33]What are you doing right now, Vinny?
[542:31.83]Are you live?
[542:32.33]Is he still going?
[542:42.53]He's ending the stream.
[542:43.79]Oh, okay.
[542:46.03]He's wrapping up.
[542:46.55]Alright, well... If we caught him a little earlier, I would've just sent everybody there.
[542:52.29]But, Nate, thanks for the six dollars!
[542:55.00]Nate, you've been given a lot of money.
[542:58.42]We gotta get you on, like, the money cool-down here.
[543:01.28]You've been given a shitload of money.
[543:04.06]That's, like, $40 or $50 tonight.
[543:07.63]Thank you so much.
[543:12.83]Ban him from donating.
[543:21.69]And there he is again.
[543:22.47]Thanks for the three bucks, Nate.
[543:23.99]Much love.
[543:24.53]Love trolling you.
[543:25.47]Oh, by the way.
[543:26.07]Oh, by the way, Half-Life 3 is coming out soon.
[543:29.90]Can't wait.
[543:30.58]Bye.
[543:30.94]Well, I've got some bad news for you.
[543:37.38]Half-Life 3 is probably never going to release.
[543:40.10]I would be very surprised if it did.
[543:43.36]I would be so happy if it did, but I don't think it's going to happen.
[543:47.53]You'll be probably waiting a while.
[543:52.08]But thank you all.
[543:53.40]See you all later today.
[543:55.98]Somewhere around 3 to 4ish p.m.
[543:58.40]Pacific.
[544:01.62]Fans are gonna make it.
[544:02.88]Well, they would get sued.
[544:07.26]Alright.
[544:08.04]See you guys tomorrow.
[544:09.34]Today.
[544:10.99]Later today for almost all of you.
[544:13.79]Take care.
[544:15.19]See you soon.
[544:16.03]More PlayStation 2 on the way.
[544:17.69]I promise we're not gonna get stuck on one.
[544:20.03]The first one.
