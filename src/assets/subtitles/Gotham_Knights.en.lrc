[00:03.10]I'm ready.
[00:10.22]Before this sponsor segment gets started, I do want to put something on real quick because I heard somebody said to watch this.
[00:19.60]I don't know what it is, but I actually have no idea what this is.
[00:23.48]I was told to watch it.
[00:25.77]It might be loud, so just turn your volume down a little bit.
[00:29.21]I'm serious.
[00:29.61]Turn your volume down.

[00:40.84]Okay.

[01:45.40]Oh, I completely forgot that I live tweeted the entire Hubie Halloween movie.
[01:50.44]It was in my drafts.
[01:51.56]It's like five paragraphs.
[01:54.15]I forgot about that.
[01:54.65]We'll talk about that probably tomorrow.
[01:58.67]Alright, let me tweet this.
[02:05.82]Okay.
[02:06.86]Let's go!
[02:09.02]Thank you, Warner Brothers, for sponsoring this segment of the stream.

[02:44.73]That's fine.
[02:47.63]Oh, I think subtitles are on.
[02:51.65]Very easy.
[02:53.31]Very easy.
[02:54.01]Alright, if the game is on very easy, do enemies just kill each other?
[03:03.42]Right?
[03:04.36]Do you just kind of walk around?
[03:08.24]Do hard.
[03:08.92]Hard, hard, hard.
[03:10.74]Hard, please.
[03:11.48]Hard, hard, hard.
[03:12.54]Alright, fine.
[03:13.16]Jeez.
[03:22.28]I don't want the game to be too hard.
[03:23.42]Alright, I'll do it.
[03:32.18]Yeah, I did these settings already.
[03:34.06]Okay, here we go.
[03:39.12]Defragment video file.
[03:45.06]So apparently this is open world.
[03:46.63]Let's find out.
[03:49.95]Defragment.
[03:50.69]Quiet.
[04:01.86]Shit!
[04:02.58]No, that's not the right- Fuck!
[04:05.22]I'm actually fucking pissed.
[04:14.15]Hold on.
[04:41.51]Who's that?
[05:22.19]Floors just in Gotham lurking in every shadow.
[05:25.61]You don't need that mask.
[05:27.93]I know it's you We shall cool your love this blasphemy this sacrilege.
[05:34.30]Did you think you could keep it from me?
[05:41.24]Get a Batman smash a microwave on his head Oh
[05:56.58]What is that?
[06:37.35]Except us.
[06:38.51]The Gotham Knights.
[06:39.51]Wait.
[07:03.77]What is that T-Rex?
[07:10.76]My father!
[07:12.24]It will be over soon!
[07:32.77]I just did that.
[07:33.93]You saw me do that in the other thing we just played.
[08:08.85]Wait, he's got powers like that?
[08:12.37]Holy...
[08:32.93]Look out, Batman, watch out!
[08:37.04]I'm the most annoying fucking person in the movie theater.
[08:43.68]Oh, what, duck!
[08:45.79]Duck!
[08:52.45]Unlike you, I'm not afraid of dying.
[09:10.79]Alright.
[09:11.13]Well, that was quite the opening.
[09:28.70]What?
[09:29.94]His arm?
[09:32.70]Oh, I thought Batman's arm fell off.
[09:34.66]Did it?
[10:16.80]You'll be dead before they get here.
[10:20.70]Your precious family.
[10:24.00]I will slaughter them.
[10:26.00]One...
[10:28.81]This guy thinks he can beat Nightwing in a fight?
[10:30.64]Are you stupid?
[10:31.60]What a stupid asshole.
[10:32.30]You won't get a chance.
[10:57.60]Gotham is their city now.
[11:40.35]Wait, where the hell are we?
[11:42.33]Where is this?
[11:45.01]Oh, they did they just get here?
[11:51.59]Like a fucking meteor hit there.
[12:07.13]Incoming transmission.
[12:08.51]Okay.
[12:14.54]If you're watching this, I'm dead.
[12:18.68]This is a code black.
[12:21.16]This message was automatically triggered when I destroyed the cave and everything it contained.
[12:26.74]Oh, shit.
[12:27.14]This is an arm.
[12:31.24]Is this like a will?
[12:32.36]I know what's coming won't be easy.
[12:37.27]Nightwing, I know you always liked the car.
[12:39.45]You're going to have that.
[12:41.43]Batgirl, I know you are a big fan of my computer setup.
[12:44.95]I'm going to give that to you.
[12:50.75]Nothing we do is easy.
[12:53.79]Wait, he's not... I've prepared for it as best as I can.
[13:06.79]I know you have too.
[13:10.91]So he's dead.
[13:11.35]I'm sorry it's come to this.
[13:27.10]What is it?
[13:27.36]What are they?
[13:28.46]Oh my God.
[13:30.38]I wasn't looking.
[13:31.20]That scared the shit out of me.
[13:32.34]Both know it won't take long for Gotham's criminals to realize that Batman is gone.
[13:39.84]Can't count on the GCP team.
[13:41.12]Haven't trusted us since Jim died.
[13:44.24]Do you get to drive cars in this game?
[13:56.49]I'm leaving you the Belfry as the base of operations.
[14:02.46]Some of the technology is outdated.
[14:09.83]It's just chaos Oh Many of you knew Bruce from Gotham celebrity pages a handsome charming billionaire And He was that
[14:35.57]My stocks.
[14:37.13]Oh no.
[14:38.27]Batman stocks tanking.
[14:40.77]He was my nephew.
[14:44.05]He was a friend.
[14:46.49]A mentor.
[14:48.35]And a benefactor to those of us gathered here today.
[14:53.11]And to those of you who didn't know him as we did.
[14:57.15]I want to tell you this.
[14:59.79]Bruce was Gotham.
[15:04.13]He loved this city more than he loved anything.
[15:08.71]He was a protector to this city.
[15:12.40]He worked tirelessly behind the scenes to bring justice and equality.
[15:19.40]There's nothing he wouldn't do, no project he wouldn't champion, if he thought Gotham would benefit.
[15:29.43]And I think in remembering that,
[15:33.99]We remember Bruce as he truly was.
[15:45.25]He's huge, yeah.
[15:48.13]I'm getting engrossed in the story.
[15:51.96]Are they doing the bat symbol with the umbrellas?
[15:54.08]Is that what that was?
[15:57.84]You've always had my back when I needed you.
[16:00.80]I know you'll keep Gotham safe.
[16:12.69]Well, okay.
[16:19.78]Oh, I don't want to be right here.
[16:20.58]Alright, let's get to it.
[16:29.82]Go.
[16:34.25]Look what I got.
[16:34.67]Look what I have on.
[16:41.82]Hold on.
[16:42.56]I'm losing my, uh... Why's my window closing?
[16:46.60]Oh, there we go.
[16:51.92]Had it off the screen.
[16:54.71]How's Alfred?
[16:56.99]What you'd expect.
[17:00.07]Took him three years to agree to a vacation and Bruce turned up dead.
[17:06.35]He asked for some time.
[17:07.61]He knows none of us were there.
[17:09.13]Am I doing that?
[17:09.81]I feel like I'm doing that.
[17:11.25]What about you?
[17:12.71]You let Jacob came give the eulogy.
[17:15.67]He offered lights off.
[17:18.01]He thought it'd be easier on us if he was the one to do it.
[17:21.39]Lights off right?
[17:21.93]He's Bruce's uncle.
[17:24.55]Hell of a speech.
[17:26.73]All that talk about a protector works behind the scenes.
[17:33.02]If he only knew.
[17:33.78]Wait, switch.
[17:35.12]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:35.58]I'm playing as Nightwing.
[17:37.82]Are you kidding me?
[17:39.06]And what if the League of Shadows finds him?
[17:58.28]Alright, we're definitely going to be Nightwing.
[18:01.65]I know, I have to fix the camera.
[18:05.75]Let me fix my camera.
[18:08.69]I think my audio is screwed up.
[18:20.39]Hold on.
[18:23.86]My audio is cutting out.
[18:24.74]I think maybe my headphones are screwed up.
[18:29.63]It's hard to tell.
[18:32.63]Is my camera messing up?
[18:35.05]Do you see that?
[18:35.49]Something weird is going on with my camera.
[18:40.55]Yeah, my face is like flashing.
[18:43.29]What is going on?
[18:44.01]Why is my computer freaking out?
[18:45.35]I decrypted the case Batman sent with his message.
[18:49.50]We should focus on that.
[18:51.10]I looked it over, but... I'm playing as Nightwing.
[18:54.86]It doesn't look complete.
[18:56.12]I think Rache interrupted him while he was writing.
[19:00.22]He says this has implications that could shake Gotham to its core.
[19:04.54]You look like a deep fried- Ominous, but not exactly helpful.
[19:10.59]I saw a few places we should poke around.
[19:13.25]Construction sites, a quarry.
[19:14.81]He also mentioned a Dr. Langstrom.
[19:18.35]Anyone know him?
[19:18.91]So did we split up?
[19:19.75]He's a zoologist at Gotham University.
[19:22.51]Not sure what his- I don't have a spray tan!
[19:25.73]Let's divide up the work.
[19:27.59]We can meet at the Belfry when we're done.
[19:30.48]Okay.
[19:30.66]Are we ready to rock and roll here?
[19:35.74]Alright, so now do I press A?
[19:44.91]Oh, no.
[19:45.27]Oh, okay.
[19:46.15]Alright.
[19:46.79]Gifted Acrobat.
[19:48.01]Rapid combos.
[19:48.95]I don't need to read anything else.
[19:51.99]I'm not reading a single other thing.
[20:03.46]Gotham Knights.
[20:18.45]Bug.
[20:21.75]Alright, let's go.
[20:34.84]That was so unnecessary.
[20:37.04]I'm at Gotham U. What's the story so far with this professor?
[20:41.14]Kirk Langstrom.
[20:42.46]Batman attached a half-finished file to his code black.
[20:45.18]Sick.
[20:45.39]Alright.
[20:45.61]Langstrom must have been mixed up in something bad.
[20:47.25]Reach Gotham University Plaza.
[20:48.83]He's open and ready for anything then.
[20:53.23]Okay.
[20:53.71]Hold A to... Wait, you can climb?
[20:55.05]You can perch?
[20:58.05]Okay.
[21:01.13]Okay.
[21:10.76]I don't look like a Dorito.
[21:12.12]Alright, I look like a fucking Dorito.
[21:13.64]Give me a second.
[21:15.54]Let me just change the color.
[21:23.25]There.
[21:23.65]Everybody get relaxed.
[21:29.25]Alright, there we go.
[21:38.25]So it kind of controls like, um...
[21:42.33]How does it control?
[21:43.01]It's kind of like, um... I can't think of, like, a word.
[21:47.30]It's kind of like, um... It's kind of like, um... My face is triangle?
[21:53.34]Apparently, there's gear.
[21:59.63]Like, you actually pick up items.
[22:08.24]I think I have to go into my audio settings.
[22:09.56]My audio is kind of going... It's cutting out.
[22:11.78]Are you guys hearing the audio cut out?
[22:16.04]Every so often it's like... It's like I'm losing it.
[22:19.03]I wonder why.
[22:20.41]No.
[22:21.07]I wonder why that's happening to me.
[22:22.13]Okay, tap LB when you see to grapple.
[22:33.95]I would not.
[22:34.33]I'd be terrified to do that.
[22:35.19]That'd be scary.
[22:38.89]No.
[22:39.67]Okay.
[22:40.97]Reach Gotham University Plaza.
[22:42.27]Alright.
[22:42.69]Aim.
[22:42.97]So there's grapple hook points.
[22:46.40]Imagine doing this.
[22:49.86]You'd puke.
[22:50.88]Okay.
[22:51.10]Do I have like a... Okay, is it a sprint?
[23:05.42]Alright, what's in here?
[23:07.32]The cops didn't spend much time here.
[23:09.70]Langstrom must have died somewhere else.
[23:11.84]Is this office AR?
[23:13.77]Hold to use AR targeting.
[23:18.99]Oh, OK.
[23:25.26]Scan the marks on the floor, OK.
[23:30.20]I scan.
[23:35.39]Oh, right there.
[23:37.60]Gotham Knights!
[23:38.20]Follow the trail.
[23:39.62]Are we all here?
[23:41.92]No, no, I lost the trail.
[23:50.02]Oops.
[23:51.00]Sorry, Becca.
[23:51.91]I don't know where the trail went.
[24:06.06]Excuse me.
[24:06.70]That was you.
[24:08.14]Can you give me some more coordinates?
[24:11.02]Stay safe.
[24:12.80]You too.
[24:22.51]This is a lot of damage.
[24:24.85]Okay.
[24:26.31]It's on the ground there.
[24:28.63]Investigate it.
[24:31.89]Nope.
[24:35.22]Yeah, this is coming out on the 21st.
[24:37.26]So that's tomorrow, right?
[24:40.12]We get a decent look here.
[24:41.00]How do I get up there?
[24:45.67]Can I jump?
[24:47.49]Oh, there we go.
[24:48.55]There's blood everywhere.
[24:49.49]It comes out in 12 hours?
[24:52.25]Yeah, it's on everything.
[25:05.24]PS5, Xbox, both Series S and X. PC, I'm on PC right now.
[25:11.38]Seems to be running at... Seems to be running at 60.
[25:17.24]Although, I think my camera is having problems.
[25:20.49]I think it's... Hold on a second.
[25:24.11]Why is my camera fucked up?
[25:30.25]Okay.
[25:37.29]Oh, there we go.
[25:41.71]Hidden mechanism.
[25:47.08]Oh, so you can see through the wall.
[25:48.06]That's cool.
[25:48.38]Alright.
[25:51.22]Investigate.
[25:53.18]Tutorial.
[25:54.18]Investigate the crime scene.
[25:55.26]Search for evidence and uncover the truth.
[25:57.97]Use L to explore the crime scene with the cursor.
[26:00.67]Important items will be identified.
[26:02.31]Alright.
[26:03.81]Langstrom made specific note of these dates.
[26:06.96]And now I will too.
[26:08.58]20th and 21st of October are circled.
[26:11.00]What are the significance of these dates?
[26:12.62]Well, I mean, that's because when Gotham Knights comes out.
[26:19.12]What if that was what it was?
[26:20.27]Is the camera still fucked up?
[26:27.68]Oh, I know what that is.
[26:28.44]Gotham Knights comes out that day.
[26:31.78]Wait, it is.
[26:33.84]Okay, find a way to open the door.
[26:38.87]Which input device unlocks the hidden door?
[26:40.53]The passcode is 041192.
[26:45.51]The microwave.
[26:49.59]The keypad is modified with computer parts, not typically found in this sort of appliance.
[26:53.47]The display has room for three digits.
[26:59.28]Okay, let's put the password in.
[27:01.94]Oh, I can solve it, right?
[27:03.28]I'm ready.
[27:04.22]Did I just fail?
[27:05.50]How did I fail?
[27:06.87]Wait, I failed the tutorial?
[27:14.71]Passcode is... Okay, what about this speaker?
[27:18.57]Oh, wait.
[27:19.15]Okay, so I had it wrong.
[27:22.97]So the password, I gotta figure out where the password is.
[27:30.34]October 21 and 22.
[27:31.42]That's not even what that says.
[27:34.10]October 20th and 21st.
[27:36.65]This is... The gray ghost is in theaters.
[27:41.85]How many digits is this?
[27:42.71]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[27:45.59]It has to be this, right?
[27:47.03]Because it's six digits.
[27:48.77]Which device unlocked the door?
[27:52.02]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27:55.76]Ah!
[27:56.72]I've got it!
[27:57.74]I've got it, Batman!
[27:58.32]Batman!
[28:04.57]Solve it.
[28:06.10]Okay.
[28:39.47]Well, this is something.
[28:40.80]Uh-oh.
[28:43.02]Aliens.
[28:44.16]Look for evidence.
[28:44.74]Alright.
[28:47.48]What is this stuff?
[28:56.78]Batman's dead professor was researching some real sketchy stuff.
[29:00.75]Okay.
[29:02.29]Wait, is that evidence?
[29:07.31]Langstrom's desk.
[29:10.21]Okay, what do we got?
[29:14.90]Organic material collected from various animals.
[29:16.74]Samples seem to be primarily sourced from creatures in Langstrom's lab tanks.
[29:22.80]Okay, fatty tissue from a dolphin.
[29:29.67]Computer.
[29:30.03]Alright, let's get the password.
[29:31.25]What's this?
[29:33.13]That's a hard drive.
[29:34.91]Might have some answers.
[29:36.96]Alright, I got this drive.
[29:40.94]That was so funny.
[29:41.56]Oh, grapple.
[29:42.79]How do I do this again?
[29:44.91]How do I grapple?
[29:46.19]There it is.
[29:48.45]Let's go.
[29:48.99]I love his weapons.
[29:51.75]I hope I can fight something right now.
[30:15.69]A fire alarm?
[30:16.94]Did someone see me?
[30:18.98]How many polygons is on that?
[30:21.10]Wait.
[30:25.60]What the f- Why?
[30:28.11]What was the point?
[30:30.35]What's the point?
[30:32.29]What?
[30:33.43]Hey!
[30:41.74]You- Oh.
[30:52.33]Oh, just one random jobber versus Nightwing.
[30:56.92]Are you out of your mind?
[30:59.28]Yeah.
[31:00.50]It's me!
[31:08.57]Alright, his friends are looking out the window right now going like, no, he's dead.
[31:11.91]Oh shit, it's Nightwing!
[31:19.83]Why would you even fight me?
[31:20.89]Run.
[31:21.77]Run away.
[31:22.21]Why fight me?
[31:24.39]Move the icon?
[31:25.93]Oh, good idea.
[31:30.04]Up here seems pretty good, maybe?
[31:35.20]I'm gonna do something real quick.
[31:36.08]Hold on.
[31:40.26]This might sound crazy, but I'm gonna do this for one second.
[31:47.37]That might sound crazy.
[31:56.93]Okay.
[31:57.53]Half arc approach.
[31:58.63]Okay.
[31:59.23]Clear out all the freaks.
[32:01.03]I don't know, where are they?
[32:35.42]Do I have to press a button?
[32:42.59]What did I just do?
[32:47.49]What did I just do?
[32:58.22]So, like, you can tell they're superheroes, okay?
[33:01.56]You can tell they're superheroes.
[33:02.98]Because they do, like, the most elaborate shit to, like, knock somebody out.
[33:08.53]Like, no, I got an idea.
[33:09.31]I'm going to put my arms behind my back and have my baton.
[33:11.55]I'm going to grab him by the neck and spin him around.
[33:13.83]You can tell they're superheroes.
[33:18.65]Everything has to be so flashy.
[33:21.98]Better to stay hidden.
[33:28.03]Are the fumes getting to you, buddy?
[33:29.47]Talking to me?
[33:39.04]Holy shit.
[33:39.52]Hey there.
[33:45.24]Who said that?
[33:53.19]Time for sleep.
[33:54.77]Sleep?
[33:55.21]I think that kills people.
[34:00.05]Am I undetected still?
[34:04.39]Yeah, time to sleep permanently.
[34:09.24]My camera's fucking broken.
[34:17.62]You look insane.
[34:18.42]Dude, I don't know.
[34:20.11]My camera is freaking out.
[34:21.33]It's like glitching.
[34:22.03]Okay.
[34:26.29]That was interesting.
[34:29.59]Well, the takedowns are really cool.
[34:39.92]Ranged attack.
[34:43.92]What?
[34:44.08]Did I shoot lasers out of my fucking eyes?
[34:45.87]I shoot all night when he has lasers in his eyes.
[34:49.03]Oh, no he doesn't.
[35:02.14]That was cool.
[35:03.12]Like, that was really actually pretty cool.
[35:04.90]Oh, shit.
[35:05.18]Hostages.
[35:06.12]I'm coming.
[35:32.38]Where are the hostages?
[35:41.87]Oops.
[35:42.73]Dude, the flips are actually pretty cool.
[35:49.63]I'm going to die.
[35:55.09]They keep hitting me directly in the fucking head.
[36:03.37]Come here!
[36:18.85]Whoa, what if I just shot him with like a... Oh, no, no.
[36:28.49]Nightwing's dead.
[36:32.09]Wait, I have a heal?
[36:39.27]What happened?
[36:39.81]Oh my god, I have a new suit on.
[36:40.99]Alright, let's go.
[36:44.15]I think the feed is losing connection.
[36:46.84]I'm getting an audio drop every, like, five to ten seconds.
[36:50.14]I think it's... I don't know.
[36:52.64]I have to look into that.
[36:53.74]Am I running out of, like, memory?
[36:58.97]I don't know.
[37:00.55]Oh, it shouldn't be.
[37:02.43]Maybe I'll turn a setting down.
[37:08.82]that's cool the whole building is burning down let me turn a couple things down I feel like um it's something is being overloaded here dynamic resolution maybe should I bring this down maybe like 82 I wonder what's happening yeah the audio is fine for stream but for some reason it keeps uh
[37:45.93]I don't want ray tracing on.
[37:46.93]Alright, let's try this.
[37:50.23]Let me see if this helps.
[37:54.86]Yeah, because it's not coming through to you guys, but it's coming through to me, which is weird.
[38:02.73]It's not my webcam, because I'm hearing the game audio go, better make this quick.
[38:09.59]And even when the camera's off.
[38:12.36]I don't know.
[38:13.00]Let's see.
[38:13.48]I'm looking to see if the camera screws up when it happens.
[38:16.90]It does not.
[38:18.52]Alright, let's go.
[38:20.96]Did you say uh-oh?
[38:26.07]Look at this villain.
[38:40.26]Alright, fire, fire, fire.
[38:47.97]Oh, that's right.
[38:48.37]It's on hard.
[38:49.31]I was wondering.
[38:50.73]I was like, my God, these fucking freaks are giving me just so much trouble.
[39:01.76]Who's yelling?
[39:02.50]Is that one of them yelling at me?
[39:15.67]I'm fighting them right now!
[39:18.36]Alright, I'm here.
[39:30.63]Oh, thank you.
[39:33.45]Appreciate it.
[39:36.39]Uh-oh.

[39:51.25]Alright, let's go.
[39:53.71]Alright, you got a shield?
[39:57.17]Gonna teach me something here?
[40:13.68]Old x-ray.
[40:15.04]Okay.
[40:15.32]Heavy melee attacks and guard break abilities can get through enemy defenses, leaving them vulnerable to other attacks.
[40:20.25]Okay.
[40:23.65]Okay.
[40:30.36]Bulldozer.
[40:46.69]How did you miss?
[40:47.33]That was a shotgun.
[40:52.81]Oh shit, don't kill me.
[41:02.78]Oh shit.
[41:03.34]I knew I shouldn't have brought the foam batons this time.
[41:15.09]I can wait.
[41:15.73]Can I break the counter?
[41:18.57]Wait, what was that?
[41:19.37]Did I do it?
[41:23.63]Oh, alright.
[41:32.08]Oh, don't kill me, please.
[41:32.94]Don't kill me.
[41:33.58]I can't lose to the tutorial.
[41:40.06]Oh, wait a minute.

[44:18.71]What happened?
[44:19.91]What happened?
[44:22.24]What?
[44:22.48]Am I in trouble?
[44:24.22]What's happening?
[44:24.96]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[44:26.40]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[44:27.88]I'm a criminal.
[44:29.08]How do I get off?
[44:29.94]How do I get out of here?
[44:31.51]Oh my god.
[44:32.09]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[44:35.07]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[44:37.33]I gotta get out of here.
[44:42.46]What the fuck?
[44:46.75]Alright.
[44:48.75]I didn't mean to do that.
[44:50.95]That was an accident.
[44:52.65]It was an accident.
[44:56.31]Why?
[44:59.08]Come on, I'm Nightwing.
[45:00.90]Oh my god.
[45:01.48]Okay, I'm going to have fun in this game.
[45:07.88]Okay, let's get on the bike.
[45:12.24]Let's eject.
[45:18.75]Alright, I gotta get... I can do a wheelie?
[45:25.39]Wait, can I just jump off?
[45:34.08]Oh wait, I'm getting Mario Karted.
[45:38.30]What happened?
[45:39.14]I can help.
[45:39.50]I'm a superhero.
[45:40.23]How do I get off?
[45:43.37]How do I get off this?
[45:44.97]Alright.
[45:45.29]You need someone to Jack you up?
[45:46.67]I got you.
[45:53.81]You're welcome, citizen!
[45:55.58]Make sure to always call the Batman Cadets!
[46:00.10]Alright, gotta go this way.
[46:09.87]Oh my god, I feel like- what's on my mouth?
[46:11.51]Like a piece of dirt was on my mouth.
[46:22.09]Okay, so don't just drive around like a psycho.
[46:36.15]Well, I'm a- What the fuck?!
[46:42.02]I'm a bad guy!
[46:42.82]They- He took a- Get me out of here!
[46:49.84]Oh, did I screw this up so bad?
[46:52.47]How did I screw this up so bad?
[46:54.03]Ow!
[46:56.39]I don't... Why am I a villain?
[46:58.65]It's Nightwing!
[46:59.29]Get him!
[47:04.33]Oh my god!
[47:11.36]Oh my god!
[47:19.29]What?
[47:20.23]Did I do that?
[47:22.85]I didn't.
[47:23.81]I promise I didn't set your college on fire.
[47:28.01]I'm a good guy.
[47:29.13]I'm one of the bad... The bad knights.
[47:33.04]The Gotham Knights.
[47:38.68]Okay.
[47:39.82]Let's go.
[47:43.80]That was ridiculous.
[47:47.11]I can't believe that I was getting shot at.
[47:49.53]Hey, Nightwing, what took you so long?
[47:55.81]Well, you mean... Can I actually stop and help?
[48:07.58]Can I actually...
[48:15.89]Let's go.
[48:16.72]This is fun.
[48:17.72]Okay, so just go through here and hopefully you don't get mad.
[48:26.91]Tripped?
[48:43.19]Okay Why those
[49:13.76]That guy just do that.
[49:18.10]A wheelie.
[49:22.00]I almost hit my head on the ceiling, dude.
[49:28.05]Now I'm busy doing a wheelie.
[49:34.97]Come on, I'm going for the record.
[49:52.84]Imagine seeing Nightwing drive by.
[49:57.06]You're on a side street and he's doing a wheelie in the fucking Gotham copter or whatever this thing is.
[50:01.98]Can I wave or anything?
[50:09.77]How do I do anything?
[50:19.70]There has to be a way I can interact, right?
[50:21.24]Oh.
[50:21.84]Select emote.
[50:22.18]How do I do that?
[50:22.60]How do I do it?
[50:47.63]Why the emotes?
[50:48.53]Okay, this is funny.
[50:50.27]I love this.
[50:52.83]I'm having fun.
[51:05.54]Jeez.
[51:06.00]Alright, so how do I get in here?
[51:08.32]Reach the East Plaza.
[51:10.08]Can I climb this?
[51:10.64]Do I have a map?
[51:26.06]Nightwing, yeah.
[51:27.63]I'm going to turn it down a little, though.
[51:29.03]I feel like it's very loud.
[51:31.05]Let me know if it sounds better.
[51:38.35]So you can play as any of the four characters, I think, at any time.
[51:40.87]I'm just choosing to stay on Nightwing.
[51:43.74]Maybe I'll probably get access to it.
[51:45.90]You can play as Back Earl, you can play as Red Hood, Nightwing, obviously, and Robin.
[52:14.28]I'm getting sweaty right now.
[52:19.35]I'm curious about the gear.
[52:23.79]Apparently you can collect gear.
[52:28.59]The whole thing is co-op too, so that's pretty cool.
[52:32.94]Alright, we gotta watch this.
[52:33.94]Pay attention.
[52:45.06]Yeah, it's online co-op.
[52:46.94]I think it's like drop in, drop out, I think.
[52:49.08]Uh-oh.
[52:50.60]A little bit of a conflict in the team here.
[53:14.14]I'm gonna solve this case my way.
[53:20.27]Stop it!
[53:22.07]He wanted us to work this together.
[53:28.93]Whatever.
[53:30.51]That's making this harder than it has to be, kid.
[53:36.69]I guess, since we're waiting anyway... ...we might as well take another look at what Bruce had on Lindstrom.
[53:43.78]Alright, everybody, uh-oh.
[53:45.02]I've been hacked.
[53:45.62]No need.
[53:45.86]I've put in a small fix that should hold for a while.
[53:48.04]Alfred!
[53:48.55]Wasn't sure you were coming, Alfred.
[54:09.62]I'll always be here when you need me, Master Richard.
[54:13.18]When any of you need me.
[54:14.84]He's so cool.
[54:17.22]I'm glad you're here.
[54:19.96]As am I, Master Tim.
[54:24.74]This place does need work.
[54:31.22]Damn it!
[54:32.33]We've got activity all over the city!
[54:35.19]Sweet.
[54:36.79]Looks like my plan wins.
[54:40.20]He's- He's huge.
[54:41.78]God.
[54:41.92]Give him more lines.
[54:43.24]Ugh.
[54:44.38]He's so awesome.
[55:15.75]Open the Abilities menu and spend Ability Points to unlock Perfect Evade.
[55:19.40]Uh, wait, what?
[55:26.18]How do I do that?
[55:32.13]How do I do that?
[55:32.91]Robin, how do I do it?
[55:34.59]Hey, Tim.
[55:35.79]How'd it go at the quarry?
[55:38.01]Not well.
[55:38.85]I sweep the whole place and didn't find anything.
[55:41.31]No one's been there in ages.
[55:43.33]How are we supposed to see the full picture when most of the pieces are missing?
[55:46.32]Bruce left us one hell of a last case.
[55:50.78]I mean, what kind of person builds a secret lab in their lab?
[55:56.88]Someone who has something to hide, obviously.
[55:58.62]But what?
[56:00.20]What was he trying to make, and who is he hiding it from?
[56:04.04]Yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
[56:05.70]Yeah, I'm telling you.
[56:06.20]Let's wait and see what that hard drive has to tell us first.
[56:08.08]If they sell that Robin raincoat... We'll get some answers soon.
[56:11.18]Are you shitting me?
[56:11.87]That would sell a hundred billion things.
[56:13.49]That would sell a hundred billion copies of this coat that he has on right here.
[56:17.63]A hundred billion.
[56:26.74]Alright.
[56:28.68]Alright.
[56:29.28]Wait, okay.
[56:30.20]There's a skill tree for each character, I think.
[56:35.83]Leveling up your character rewards ability points that can be spent to learn new abilities.
[56:38.76]Spending ability points also unlocks access to new abilities, right?
[56:41.52]So everybody has a skill tree?
[56:44.40]Alright, so I have to get this one.
[56:48.06]Nightwing performs a perfectly timed evade that generates momentum and allows for perfect attack follow-up.
[56:55.03]Okay, so it's a perfect dodge and then you can attack.
[56:58.11]Cool.
[56:59.39]Holy shit.
[57:00.05]Alright, well we're getting that.
[57:04.55]As you continue your investigation, each hero can unlock unique momentum abilities.
[57:08.51]Use the momentum abilities menu to view unlocked conditions and unlocked abilities.
[57:15.03]Okay.
[57:16.47]Cool.
[57:18.75]Alright, so I got beat down unlocked.
[57:24.58]Cool.
[57:26.42]So now we have... Did I... I think it wants me to look around.
[57:31.34]What is this one?
[57:35.15]I think I'm going to go down the acrobat tree.
[57:40.99]Using momentum abilities restores health.
[57:43.87]Oh, that's damn good.
[57:46.47]You can chain evades.
[57:49.49]Yeah.
[57:50.31]I'm definitely doing acrobat.
[57:53.91]I'm just going to do that for fun in front of people.
[57:56.68]Just like citizens.
[57:57.32]They're going to be like, holy shit, this guy's sick.
[58:01.16]Alright.
[58:03.08]More momentum gain.
[58:05.51]Grants an extra momentum bar.
[58:07.11]Okay.
[58:11.09]Raises all defense and resistance by 10%.
[58:13.79]Working with allies also grants additional bonuses.
[58:16.64]Cool.
[58:16.78]Oh, I want to see gear.
[58:21.50]Momentum abilities.
[58:24.96]You just unlocked your first momentum ability.
[58:27.50]They're unique to each character and require momentum to activate.
[58:29.93]When ready, the ability icon in the lower right corner will change.
[58:34.59]Hold right bumper plus the assigned button.
[58:38.41]Ah, alright, so let's expect superpowers.
[58:42.88]So it costs one momentum.
[58:46.10]I got it, okay.
[58:49.46]Exit the Bellfry and patrol Gotham City.
[58:52.26]Let's go.
[58:55.24]Yeah, I'll play with the other characters over the next couple days.
[58:59.50]And start tonight's patrol.
[59:08.21]After you grab an enemy, wait, you can grab?
[59:15.19]Opportunistic crime.
[59:16.45]Tap down to display nearby opportunistic crimes.
[59:20.51]They appear as that in the HUD.
[59:24.17]Oh, I got a map.
[59:27.66]Okay.
[59:28.70]Crimes you discover during patrol can be viewed on the map along with any additional activities you have available.
[59:33.66]Place a waypoint wherever you want to go.
[59:35.36]Okay, cool.
[59:42.89]You just got it.
[59:43.77]You just got that game.
[59:47.57]You just got it.
[59:52.95]That game.
[59:53.15]That game.
[59:58.90]Alright, so what is, what's going on here?
[60:00.08]What is this?
[60:01.06]There's just crimes all over the city?
[60:03.90]Well, let's go get one.
[60:07.38]Ooh.
[60:10.34]I'm just going, I'm going to this one right in front of me.
[60:22.41]Did you get by a train?
[60:26.93]You can't get hit by the train, right?
[60:28.41]Please tell me.
[60:31.46]Can you get hit by the train?
[60:47.10]Go on.
[60:47.96]Drive.
[60:54.38]Alright.
[60:54.62]I don't think you can.
[60:55.42]I don't know.
[60:55.88]Maybe you can't.
[61:00.53]Maybe other people get it.
[61:01.57]Wait, was that the bat signal?
[61:08.21]Alright, I need to find some crime.
[61:11.09]There's a crime going on right there.
[61:12.07]Hurry up.
[61:23.96]Oh, they're breaking into the bank.
[61:24.74]I almost got it.
[61:27.62]Yeah, I almost got it.
[61:42.67]You can't see me.
[61:43.27]You can't see me.
[61:49.28]I love it.
[61:49.70]Okay.
[61:50.26]Hold on.
[61:50.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[61:58.16]Dude, Nightwing just chokes the shit out of people.
[62:10.40]That killed him instantly.
[62:13.07]Nightwing doesn't care.
[62:14.35]Nightwing kills people, right?
[62:19.15]What is all this stuff?
[62:20.00]Clues?
[62:25.48]Defeat criminals to gather clues.
[62:29.64]What?
[62:30.34]So I just did it.
[62:30.94]So that's one crime.
[62:39.05]There's another crime.
[62:39.59]Wait.
[62:45.01]Why did it just tell me to... Something was blinking over here.
[62:46.95]What was that?
[62:49.98]Did I miss somebody?
[62:53.96]Oh, this is right here.
[62:55.26]Okay, hold on.
[62:57.14]I don't want to be here.
[63:00.30]Oh, they're inside.
[63:02.48]How do I get in?
[63:07.29]I'm probably going to drop down.
[63:08.13]Alright, let me go up.
[63:19.86]Okay, here we go.
[63:32.49]Shit!
[63:33.31]Oops.
[63:38.21]Oh!
[63:44.07]He's got a gun!
[63:44.91]He has a gun!
[63:45.45]You gotta run!
[63:46.39]He has a gun!
[63:46.75]He has a machine gun!
[64:24.89]Nice.
[64:25.25]Alright, that was a good combo.
[64:30.80]What's my special move?
[64:32.08]Alright, that's cool.
[64:49.55]Sorry, what were you saying?
[64:51.67]I'm sorry.
[64:52.27]What did you say?
[64:55.21]Belfry here.
[64:56.03]Happy to report we're now fully operational.
[64:59.20]Before you head back, though... You got something, Belfry?
[65:03.78]The hard drive from Langstrom's lab requires a biodecryption key.
[65:09.68]That sounds like it's in his body.
[65:11.80]Which is at the morgue.
[65:13.48]Indeed.
[65:13.86]With knights in Gotham as they are, it should be quiet at the station.
[65:20.99]I guess I did want to see how Montoya was handling the new commissioner.
[65:24.67]I'll let you know what I find Hey, he didn't want to do it what the hell that's good this shit I thought I was coming to like assassinate me That vigilante nightwing That was so oh my god, alright Good luck out there
[66:04.78]Crime being committed!
[66:10.38]Citizen!
[66:14.74]What are you doing?
[66:23.47]Oh my god!
[66:24.03]Okay, what do I do?
[66:41.17]Alright, I understand the combo system now.
[66:53.46]Pretty good dodges.
[66:54.56]Pretty good dodges.
[67:23.05]Okay, reach GCPD rendezvous point.
[67:28.88]Should I get in the car?
[67:40.22]You can just fly around the city.
[67:46.72]Oh my goodness.
[67:47.82]That's so high.
[67:50.52]Is there fall damage?
[67:52.19]Let's find out.
[67:58.36]I think I pressed a button.
[68:01.64]Can you do anything with the cars?
[68:10.84]I don't think so.
[68:17.71]What is that?
[68:23.03]Alright, let's go.
[68:24.55]Rendezvous point.
[68:31.66]It is.
[68:37.06]You're doing an E3 presentation?
[68:41.21]I am not.
[68:41.87]Alright, so where am I going to go from here?
[68:52.16]For a second I thought I just grabbed onto a helicopter.
[68:54.12]Alright, here's the rendezvous point.
[68:57.72]Let's see.
[68:58.62]I'm on E... Stop calling me E3 Andy!
[69:00.24]That's... I... I'm... Alright.
[69:02.70]That's him.
[69:04.68]Remain undetected.
[69:06.25]I'm sneaking into the station here.
[69:09.73]Okay.
[69:10.23]They don't see that, right?
[69:29.98]No, they can't see shit.
[69:31.18]I'm fine.
[69:46.42]E3 Ernie?
[69:46.78]That's what they call me!
[69:50.70]Alright, is anybody here?
[69:55.46]There's one person there, but that's fine.
[70:02.42]Okay.
[70:04.00]Remain undetected still.
[70:11.14]Oh shit.
[70:19.63]Okay.
[70:19.77]Is he gonna make like a distraction noise?
[70:32.16]How am I supposed to get over here?
[70:32.92]I want to be on his fucking phone call so bad.
[70:49.58]He was FaceTiming somebody.
[71:04.24]You're a menace.
[71:07.63]Say the current time so this is not pre-recorded.
[71:09.99]It's 7.41 PM Pacific.
[71:13.07]Sorry, dude.
[71:22.49]Don't forget you promised a Bane impression.
[71:23.99]That's right.
[71:27.99]Okay.
[71:28.65]Go past the security station.
[71:29.77]I guess I can't just ask the front desk where they're keeping Langstrom's body.
[71:33.94]Blueprints put the morgue on the other side of the bullpen careful not to be seen on the way There's got to be a sneakier way in open the door There is a sneaky way
[72:02.66]Goddamn freaks.
[72:03.74]That's my daughter's school.
[72:06.04]We got a few in lockup.
[72:07.76]One caller in interrogation.
[72:10.79]I'd pay a hundred bucks for five minutes alone in there.
[72:17.45]I think I'm actually doing it.
[72:19.53]Did anyone find that John Doe buddy?
[72:23.53]Buff guy, wild outfit?
[72:26.28]Nope.
[72:27.66]Damn.
[72:28.62]Work's pretty packed with that scientist now.
[72:32.10]I don't fit up here.
[72:34.15]Find a way to the bullpen.
[72:35.51]Wait, can that guy see me?
[73:05.98]This is when I grab the microphone here.
[73:07.98]I lean in and I do this huge burp.
[73:10.10]Just like a... And then fucking run out of the building.
[73:28.34]So immature.
[73:29.18]Shaking my head.
[73:29.86]Alright, so this is a wee... Okay.
[73:37.16]Sneak through the cell block.
[73:39.46]I don't know why I just like... I think it's just one.
[73:46.30]Alright, I can get up there, right?
[74:01.54]I swear, cross my ticker.
[74:03.72]I grew an ear on my shoulder.
[74:05.64]What is that?
[74:05.98]There's like a case over here.
[74:07.29]How do I get that?
[74:13.29]No Gordon, no Batman.
[74:15.39]Decommissioned bat signal.
[74:16.55]Need for a bat signal.
[74:18.53]Oh.
[74:20.33]New Commissioner Catherine Kane had the bat signal removed from the roof and submitted into evidence.
[74:25.47]Okay.
[74:27.85]How do I get that loot box?
[74:30.29]There it is.
[74:30.85]Alright, what's in here?
[74:33.39]Various just chest in here.
[74:34.55]Was that ammo?
[74:37.07]1098 with those Nerf bullets.
[74:39.49]What was that?
[74:55.48]The morgues on the other side of this bullpen.
[74:58.19]Security cameras can alert nearby enemies to your location.
[75:01.27]Alright, don't get spotted by the cameras.
[75:04.58]I got it.
[75:08.90]Search for a nearby control panel.
[75:12.76]Deactivate the camera.
[75:14.54]Over there.
[75:14.90]Shit, it's not in here.
[75:37.80]Don't see me, don't see me, don't see me, don't see me, don't see me.
[75:41.14]What?
[75:41.50]What?
[75:41.60]Who saw me?
[75:42.32]Oh shit, I gotta hide.
[75:43.22]Can you see me?
[76:20.54]Did you just shoot the other person?
[76:23.92]Watch where you're... Jesus!
[76:41.81]I would not be firing this... Jesus, man!
[76:57.11]Oh my god if she was standing Right, oh my god Reckless behavior
[77:19.25]Stop shooting me.
[77:20.11]Ow, stop!
[77:23.73]He's bugging out?
[77:53.59]I love how I'm bugging out right now.
[77:57.34]Sick.
[78:19.28]Turn off your preview and oh, I'm dropping a lot of frames.
[78:22.02]Oh shit, what happened?
[78:23.28]What happened?
[78:28.42]Why am I dropping so many frames?
[78:39.43]Revenge of the Internet.
[78:46.47]He is bugging out.
[78:47.27]Yeah, apparently I am.
[78:49.65]I don't get it.
[78:50.07]What's going on?
[78:59.16]No, I was just getting going.
[79:00.12]I was just getting into this.
[79:00.88]Come on, Internet.
[79:01.42]Don't do this.
[79:04.84]Alright, so I can't open this.
[79:05.92]I need a keycard.
[79:07.38]Where's their keycard?
[79:10.05]Over here?
[79:11.41]Okay.
[79:11.63]I already... I mean, who cares about the alarm system?
[79:14.03]I mean, I've already been seen.
[79:18.94]Yeah, it'll pass.
[79:19.70]It'll pass.
[79:20.10]It'll pass.
[79:20.80]It'll pass.
[79:24.78]It always does.
[79:25.28]Okay.
[79:27.03]It'll pass.
[79:50.77]240p, Andy.
[80:00.58]Reach the morgue.
[80:02.54]Alright, yeah, this is bad.
[80:06.86]Let's wait for it to pass.
[80:09.72]Give me like two minutes.
[80:18.04]Yeah, let's let it pass.
[80:18.90]I don't want you to miss anything.
[80:22.60]For some reason, sometimes... I don't know why it does this.
[80:25.20]I don't get it, but it's all good.
[80:27.78]Actually, while this is... Let me look at... I want to look at the menu.
[80:34.16]We don't need frames for this.
[80:43.05]So you do... There is gear.
[80:44.11]So you can do different weapons?
[80:50.07]Wait, I didn't even know I had these.
[80:53.93]Holy shit.
[80:55.51]I couldn't even hurt anybody.
[80:57.35]That's why I couldn't kill anybody.
[80:58.93]Do I have any points?
[81:09.38]I do not.
[81:10.26]No, I do have a point.
[81:11.24]Where should I put it?
[81:13.04]While we wait for this tornado of internet to die down.
[81:18.97]An extra momentum bar.
[81:22.97]OK.
[81:27.95]Maybe health, right?
[81:30.92]I would imagine probably health.
[81:40.12]5% defense and it goes to 20% at full health, probably that.
[81:49.65]I'll do a little bit defense.
[81:53.72]Oh, I thought I had one.
[81:54.74]No, I don't have any.
[81:55.22]I can read emails.
[82:03.33]Yikes, I've dropped 10,000 frames in the last like 10 minutes.
[82:10.31]Come on.
[82:11.35]Come on, man.
[82:13.99]Really?
[82:14.25]You're not going to do it to me right now, are you?
[82:21.16]Hold on a second.
[82:23.41]You're not gonna do it to me right now, are you?
[82:40.14]Yeah, this is bad.
[82:52.09]Am I still live?
[82:53.85]Did I get smashed?
[82:59.09]I think I just got smashed out.
[83:00.63]My internet just got smashed.
[83:10.88]Okay, I'm still live.
[83:11.58]Alright, cool.
[83:13.66]Yeah, this is a massive problem right now.
[83:20.08]At this time, it is my internet.
[83:25.47]This is like abysmal.
[83:26.23]Alright.
[83:43.58]Um, shit.
[83:48.84]I was chewing your wires.
[83:55.07]This kind of came out of nowhere.
[83:56.23]I don't have a VPN on right now.
[84:09.20]What?
[84:09.40]Hold on.
[84:11.74]Did it pass?
[84:13.14]Kind of.
[84:17.16]God damn it.
[84:17.66]I was just starting to have a bunch of fun.
[84:18.88]I was just getting into it.
[84:22.95]Come on.
[84:34.99]Alright, go get a snack.
[84:39.76]Go get a snack, I'll be right back.
[84:41.98]We'll try to get it to pass.
[84:43.06]Let's try to ride it out.
[84:54.96]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[84:56.56]Try to ride it out.
[90:42.47]Alright.
[90:43.55]I am here.
[90:46.79]This is the worst I think we've ever seen it in the last few months.
[90:50.72]It's usually not like this.
[90:55.38]I played, I mean, like two or three days ago, played, we played SCORN and it was fine for six straight out, no drop frames at all.
[91:05.74]Same time frame.
[91:06.96]I don't get it.
[91:08.92]I hope this fixes.
[91:13.19]Still have like another 40 minutes or so that I want to play Gotham Knights.
[91:18.04]Playing it tomorrow too, but I really want to do it tonight.
[91:21.88]I really want to play.
[91:24.34]It should fix itself.
[91:26.92]It always does.
[91:28.50]Whenever this happens.
[91:38.85]At the very least, I'm glad I got a little time in it.
[91:40.84]I'm actually having fun.
[91:41.72]I'm having a lot of fun with it.
[91:43.00]So, let me play!
[91:45.86]Let me play!
[91:52.92]Yeah, it's still happening.
[91:54.88]Whenever this happens, for about 30 to 40 minutes, it will be an issue like this.
[92:02.24]And then it just goes right back to normal for the rest of the night.
[92:08.57]What I'm probably going to do, because these are sponsored streams and I obviously want to, you know, do them.
[92:12.81]I don't want to make sure they're good.
[92:16.47]I'm probably going to start earlier tomorrow to try to avoid this time frame.
[92:23.57]Because it's always at, I mean, we haven't had a problem like this in a long time, but when it happens, it's always at this time.
[92:31.62]So I'm going to pull the stream back tomorrow by a couple of hours.
[92:37.51]to make sure that I avoid this.
[92:43.79]Stream's not over.
[92:44.41]I'm just saying for tomorrow.
[92:50.72]Come on.
[92:54.26]Try resetting your modem.
[92:56.74]I don't think that's the problem.
[93:00.12]It really isn't.
[93:11.12]Yeah, this is by far, so I've dropped 30,000 frames in the last like four minutes, five minutes.
[93:17.83]That's the most I think it's ever been in like two or three years.
[93:21.35]So I don't, I have no idea.
[93:24.35]I could try to restart this stream and restart the modem, but I don't, I really don't think that's going to do anything.
[93:30.19]This is a pretty regular occurrence.
[93:32.05]Like, well, not regular, but it happens.
[93:38.59]I feel like it's getting better from what I'm looking at over here.
[93:45.07]I think we rode through it.
[93:46.75]I think we're good.
[93:50.56]This seems like a skill issue.
[93:59.26]It's still happening, but not as free.
[94:00.82]It'll pass.
[94:01.61]Don't worry.
[94:02.27]Let me tell you a story.
[94:12.36]It once... was a... man.
[94:19.32]I don't know, man.
[94:23.96]If anybody from WB is watching right now, I'm gonna stream the game for longer.
[94:30.77]So... Not that anybody, if anybody is.
[94:39.09]Thanks, Dad.
[94:46.38]I was just getting into it.
[94:48.52]I was just getting into it with the car and the open world.
[94:51.85]I was having fun.
[94:52.91]What's your favorite Nightwing comic?
[95:04.15]Oh, God.
[95:04.75]Issue number one.
[95:06.71]How could issue number one not be your favorite?
[95:12.19]God, I love that one.
[95:18.03]It's... It is 100% getting better.
[95:20.87]I can tell.
[95:22.53]We've dropped significantly less in the last ten minutes.
[95:25.77]The last five minutes.
[95:28.23]I think I'm gonna go for it.
[95:29.99]I think we're okay.
[95:31.59]It's gonna still happen a little bit.
[95:32.81]It'll pass.
[95:36.39]Hi.
[95:38.44]You tell me.
[95:38.82]What do you think?
[95:40.18]It's probably still gonna happen a little bit.
[95:42.64]But it looks like it's passing.
[95:51.41]Is it as bad as it was before?
[95:52.55]I could be so moist because I'm sweating.
[96:04.42]32,000 frames dropped.
[96:21.15]Steam is just going to come out of my ears.
[96:26.35]Not dead.
[96:29.38]You knocked these guys out during VRB.
[96:31.04]No, I did not.
[96:31.68]These guys are already lying down here.
[96:35.14]Alright, I think it's passing.
[96:36.56]It's going to happen.
[96:39.08]Sorry, but I'm glad it didn't die completely and I'm glad it's probably going to pass.
[96:44.05]Everybody just, we're going to pray together.
[96:47.35]Okay.
[96:47.47]Okay.
[97:05.52]Who's this?
[97:09.59]Guys, it's working.
[97:10.81]Keep praying, it's working.
[97:13.29]Who's that?
[97:16.69]Belfry, tell your uncle he's here.
[97:20.07]Copy that.
[97:20.99]Be careful.
[97:23.76]You know you can't beat me.
[97:30.16]My beloved has trained you well.
[97:31.98]Pretty sure he told you to stay out of Gotham.
[97:36.50]Dead men's wishes don't concern me.
[97:38.98]Besides, I'm here to clean up my father's mess.
[97:43.05]Which, in this case, is the demon himself.
[97:46.55]Wait, you're gonna... What are you doing?
[97:48.67]Oh.
[97:49.35]You're just burning him?
[97:51.15]Might be hard to bring Ra's back if he's ash, Talia.
[97:54.28]Even a Lazarus pit has song blades.
[97:59.36]Wait.
[98:01.22]Why was he after Bruce?
[98:03.33]Is this a fight?
[98:07.27]Oh, it got me!
[98:08.11]I was just here watching!
[98:10.87]That was funny, it was.
[98:11.55]That's not a Gandalf.
[98:24.16]That is not a Gandalf again.
[98:31.42]It was funny, but it lagged.
[98:38.85]Okay.
[98:39.05]I'm going to find the body.
[98:39.95]What's my favorite soda?
[98:40.71]Dude, you know what actually is kind of good?
[98:43.23]The Dream World Coke.
[98:47.03]It's actually pretty good.
[98:47.95]I like it.
[99:03.38]Alright, find the key.
[99:04.46]Which device conceals the biodecryption key?
[99:07.64]Blood would definitely be handy for biodecryption.
[99:10.22]I think so.
[99:11.82]Blood sample.
[99:13.98]Which device conceals the key?
[99:18.02]The tweezers.
[99:20.20]100%.
[99:22.16]It's 100% the tweezers.
[99:26.06]Oh, never mind.
[99:26.36]I'm kidding.
[99:26.70]I won't make a joke about needing a tissue.
[99:29.83]Is this for playing a game online?
[99:36.57]The MMO key, wait, you have an MMO key fob?
[99:41.81]You put blood on your MMO key fob.
[99:45.33]No, that's not how it, that's not how it works.
[99:51.66]Piercy died slowly and painfully.
[99:53.80]I wonder if the GCPD has my prints on file.
[99:56.40]Cranial bruising and swelling, multiple stab wounds on his arms and legs, some wounds pierced through him, making it possible to pin his body to the wall.
[100:08.39]There are also precise knife wounds in the chest and head.
[100:10.63]Jesus.
[100:14.61]Okay.
[100:16.95]The fingerprints.
[100:20.31]And... The calculator.

[101:10.92]Okay.
[101:12.12]Fingerprints, blood, urine.
[101:18.26]They didn't perform a full autopsy.
[101:22.99]It's amazing you can read oxygen through a finger.
[101:25.99]Okay, so this is an oxygen meter.
[101:29.55]Health issues about those recovered from certain surgeries.
[101:31.55]Okay, so the pulse oximeter.

[102:31.68]Old coffee.
[102:32.32]Okay.
[102:32.69]It's the MMO thing and urine.
[102:35.91]No.
[102:36.85]The MMO and soft tissue.

[104:52.81]Wait.
[104:53.21]What Robin is on the Titans?
[104:55.79]Is it this Robin?
[104:56.37]Yes.
[105:00.67]No, that's a different Robin.
[105:23.89]Yes and no.
[105:28.97]Okay.
[105:29.17]Because, yes, Jason Todd, Dick Grayson, and then...

[105:50.17]Oh, holy shit.
[105:53.13]Alright, I just gotta get out of here.
[106:03.87]Did you just actually kill me?
[106:06.83]He's cheering.
[106:07.49]They're cheering.
[106:09.23]Are you kidding me?
[106:15.09]Yo, whoa, what did it just do?
[106:16.89]It just took away shit.
[106:18.09]It took away a bunch of diamonds.
[106:19.43]What was that?
[106:22.22]What did it just delete from my checking account?
[106:24.64]My, like, superhero checking account.
[106:26.62]What the fuck just happened?

[106:54.89]alright what was that it was the medical bill dude that was that was actually oh okay cool fast travel
[107:19.80]I had zero crimes stopped.
[107:23.62]One citizen rescued.
[107:25.82]What did I do all day?
[107:27.02]I haven't been very helpful.
[107:34.55]How do you get zero?
[107:40.27]Alright.
[107:42.89]Okay, lab notes, formulas, financial records, research into hearing loss.
[107:50.66]So we're in our regular clothes.
[108:22.46]Hey, I forgot how sweet your setup was, Babs.
[108:26.28]It's ancient, but it'll do for now.
[108:29.44]You and Master Bruce are the only two people in the entire world who would consider the Belfry systems ancient.
[108:38.45]While researching Langstrom, I also called up all we've got on...
[108:44.20]Did somebody ask where Batman is?
[108:45.76]Do we tell him?
[108:47.50]Or should you find out on your own?
[108:50.32]Should we tell him?
[108:51.12]I wonder why she didn't take a chance and use a Lazarus pit to revive him.
[109:13.49]Well, Batman would just find Talia and ask her himself.
[109:19.86]Wait, you mean to tell me that was Robin?
[109:22.16]Yeah, I can double check Talia's kunai.
[109:25.04]Robin, holy shit, you got huge.
[109:28.68]You should also hit the streets.
[109:30.26]Find out if anyone had any beef with Langstrom.
[109:32.72]Sweet.
[109:34.44]Time to bust some skulls.
[109:43.07]He hit the gym, yeah.
[109:44.15]I mean, seriously, he's an absolutely massive person.
[109:51.36]Got new intel for the evidence board.
[109:57.59]Oh.
[109:57.77]Cool.
[109:57.97]Oh, I got a point.
[109:58.63]I can't get over what Talia did to her father's body back there.
[110:02.99]Good riddance.
[110:04.15]Going in a Lazarus pit once is hell.
[110:06.53]Who knows what a thousand don't.
[110:08.28]Evidence boards.
[110:10.12]Track information discovered during investigation.
[110:12.68]Lead section features the most relevant information about your next steps.
[110:16.47]Okay.
[110:21.07]Alright, so I got intel.
[110:23.30]Ross was in the Batcave with Bruce when it collapsed.
[110:26.02]We might never know why he was there to begin with.
[110:31.62]Talia Al Ghul, daughter of Ross Al Ghul, the Demon's Head, and next in line as the leader of the League of Shadows.
[110:37.58]Until Ross passed her... Oh, I was like, what the hell is going on over there?
[110:42.88]In favor of naming Bruce as his heir.
[110:45.44]Last time Bruce faced Talia, he told her to never return to Gotham.
[110:49.10]Now that he's gone, she's decided to come back.
[110:51.30]Great.
[110:52.90]Great.
[110:56.70]Okay.
[110:56.82]Okay.
[111:00.95]Learn about your next steps.
[111:05.13]A little chat or snitches.
[111:09.42]Alright, the freaks claim Robinson Park as their territory.
[111:12.10]Once in the area, use your compass to find the informants.
[111:16.14]Or interrogate the mob to find out more information.
[111:19.80]Let's do snitches.
[111:22.62]Alright, let's go for this one.
[111:25.80]So this is the west end.
[111:28.24]So get to the west end.
[111:30.66]Okay.
[111:31.62]Case file.
[111:35.32]Basic training.
[111:36.28]Oh, okay.
[111:36.62]Cool.
[111:39.56]Alright, let's go do that.
[111:41.66]Craft a new melee weapon.
[111:43.00]Is this crafting?
[111:45.38]Complete interrogation training.
[111:53.20]Oh, this is all my currencies.
[111:55.08]Oh, alright.
[111:55.74]I'm ready.
[111:58.70]Require blueprints and salvage to craft better suits and weapons.
[112:01.36]Go to the melee blueprint.
[112:07.18]I can make a new suit?
[112:07.88]Okay, a new melee weapon.
[112:11.79]Crafting is ready.
[112:14.11]I already have better ones, don't I?
[112:19.69]This is 10 damage.
[112:24.28]The one I have is better, isn't it?
[112:31.96]Yeah, I already own it.
[112:32.78]Why would I craft it?
[112:36.36]Can I craft gear?
[112:36.94]I cannot.
[112:39.47]Alright, that's cool.
[112:40.33]So I got to find a blueprint.
[112:43.99]Wait, I actually might have to do this for the tutorial.
[112:49.51]I do.
[112:52.16]Well, I mean, I'll put them on.
[112:59.88]These aren't, wait, these are level two.
[113:03.69]Oh, you can dismantle shit.
[113:04.75]Alright, dismantle?
[113:06.19]Yep.
[113:08.39]Ooh.
[113:09.17]That was cool.
[113:11.95]Alright.
[113:12.23]Do I have any points?
[113:15.96]No.
[113:18.52]That's crafting.
[113:19.24]I gotta do the interrogation training.
[113:22.04]I can't wait to see what this is.
[113:28.80]Practice combat.
[113:29.87]Stealth, momentum.
[113:30.39]I don't need to do that.
[113:40.15]Interrogation training.
[113:44.27]You just dismantled the heroic for an uncommon.
[113:50.16]Did I screw that up?
[113:52.00]Should I not have done that?
[114:12.90]It did less damage.
[114:14.92]Why not break it down?
[114:16.38]Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night expecting Bruce to call me for help.
[114:23.15]And then I remember.
[114:27.31]I thought it might have been one of you calling just now.
[114:30.84]I was worried.
[114:35.18]Old habits, I suppose.
[114:41.01]That's why I thought going to Bloodhaven alone would be easier.
[114:47.32]But it wasn't.
[114:51.72]I won't be like him, Alfred.
[114:55.09]Bruce left some big shoes to fill.
[114:59.55]But I'm gonna do things my way.
[115:03.63]And I'll be here to support you.
[115:07.38]Gotham is in good hands.
[115:09.49]So if you do this with a different character, is it a different cutscene?
[115:13.61]Or have I not opened that ability to change characters yet?
[115:21.15]Gotham City needs a new guardian.
[115:22.65]Complete knighthood challenges to unlock powerful new abilities for each hero, including their unique heroic travel.
[115:29.49]Oh, wait, you get to actually fly.
[115:30.97]Seems like Dr. Langstrom was into some pretty wild stuff.
[115:35.27]I wish he was still alive.
[115:37.29]I'd ask him what the heck he was thinking.
[115:42.36]Alright, what's the interrogation thing?
[115:48.07]Prepare for... Do I have to do this?
[115:49.39]I think I have to do this.
[115:57.23]No, I don't.
[116:04.98]Where is the interrogation train?
[116:06.00]Oh, sorry.
[116:06.18]I'm here.
[116:12.92]ah because she was fiercely loyal to him no because she wasn't afraid to call people on their including him is that actually what I just I have to do the training physical and mental preparation go hand in hand here we can train the mind to prepare
[116:43.68]What's the hottest pepper you've ever had?
[116:47.93]Oh, jalapeño.
[116:49.67]Ooh, hot, hot!
[116:50.35]Okay.
[116:52.33]Wait, I can do that?
[116:53.77]That's cool.
[116:54.23]That not perfect?
[116:57.56]That was perfect.
[117:29.20]Cool.
[117:35.91]Cool.
[117:38.39]Cool.
[117:46.11]How was that not perfect?
[117:51.69]Nice.
[117:54.29]Leveled up, right?
[117:57.32]I'm proud of you, dick.
[117:59.82]Hey, thanks.
[118:02.50]Cool.
[118:02.84]I leveled up though, didn't I?
[118:03.90]Alright, so am I missing something or do I?
[118:06.18]Interrogation is probably one of those advanced combat moves.
[118:09.22]I'm going to assume.
[118:11.90]Momentum.
[118:13.68]Interrogate.
[118:14.64]Smoke bombs.
[118:15.34]Guard break.
[118:15.84]Combo.
[118:16.28]Stealth.
[118:16.60]Grabbing.
[118:16.98]Oh, interrogation.
[118:17.82]Here we go.
[118:22.05]Hold to scan criminals and locate the informant.
[118:25.49]Grab informants to interrogate them.
[118:28.84]Interesting Enemies can be interrogated if they've been grabbed use stealth to approach and grab an enemy That's not grab that is How do I interrogate give me a hint
[118:55.18]Okay.
[118:55.72]I think I get it.
[118:56.44]What happened to that person?
[118:57.82]Okay.
[118:57.96]I'm gonna grab.
[119:26.17]What do you got?
[119:26.73]I got the answers you need.
[119:30.02]Appreciate the tip.
[119:31.24]Cool.
[119:34.26]You're ready to move on.
[119:37.70]I'm proud of you, Dick.
[119:38.94]Thanks, Batman.
[119:39.54]Appreciate it.
[119:52.76]Oh, okay.
[119:53.20]Let's go.
[119:55.07]Alright, I have a patrol.
[119:55.89]Exit the bell and patrol Gotham City.
[120:03.55]Check your email.
[120:09.04]Wait, we're sending emails to each other?
[120:10.84]We're in the same room.
[120:13.70]We're dropping frames again.
[120:14.58]There's honestly nothing I can do about it.
[120:17.18]I wish there was a magic wand I could wave, but... It just isn't.
[120:22.22]And that's just the way it is.
[120:23.22]So... That's the way it is.
[120:27.45]Alright, so why is he emailing me?
[120:28.83]I had an idea.
[120:31.97]There's this thing called the Gotham Historical Circuit that takes you to all these cool spots around the city.
[120:36.98]We should check them out.
[120:37.72]There's an app for it, but I replaced the data with Bruce's files just for us.
[120:41.22]Okay.
[120:46.52]So you can... Okay, I get it.
[120:48.70]So these are little side missions.
[120:49.76]That's cute.
[120:51.04]These are cute missions.
[120:55.00]Guys, remember when Bruce hid Batarangs all over the city for us to find so we could practice parkour?
[121:00.44]We never found them all.
[121:01.94]Okay.
[121:04.83]Alright.
[121:06.37]Alright, that's cool.
[121:13.06]Case file investigation.
[121:15.42]Weird science.
[121:17.80]Langstrom was murdered no matter what, the cops say.
[121:20.52]See if anyone on the street knows what might have happened.
[121:24.14]Alright, let's do it.
[121:31.10]You emailed yourself.
[121:37.70]I did email myself.
[121:38.82]That was a...
[121:42.21]Boy, sometimes you need to remember stuff.
[121:47.03]Alright, let's go.
[121:54.47]I need to do some interrogation.
[121:55.89]What's going on down here?
[122:07.18]Alright, I gotta interrogate somebody.
[122:11.82]Who should I interrogate?
[122:13.32]Open the activity view?
[122:16.63]What's up?
[122:16.95]Alright, I'm definitely doing way more damage with these by the way.
[123:02.45]Clues!
[123:04.05]Dude, Gotham City is fucking wretched.
[123:09.52]I didn't even interrogate anybody.
[123:10.56]That was my bad.
[123:17.80]Uh, give me the bike.
[123:23.57]Is there a horn?
[123:31.74]Oh, there's like a bank robbery over here.
[123:33.42]Do you see that?
[123:41.35]You robbed him.
[123:41.75]Sorry, wrong person.
[123:49.24]Is it the wrong person?
[123:51.32]Somebody was running with like a bag.
[123:58.72]Oh, okay.
[123:59.18]There they go.
[123:59.52]There they go.
[124:11.14]Yep.
[124:12.12]Robbery in progress.
[124:12.94]Alright.

[125:03.18]Swing!
[125:03.74]Oh, okay.
[125:11.15]There's a lot of people now.
[125:13.54]I'm running like grenades like a rocket launcher or something Are you even trying to hit me?
[125:42.27]They didn't get any money.
[125:44.47]Oh, this is the guy with the money.
[125:46.97]Give me that money back or how do I pick it up?
[125:51.41]One guy got like a duffel bag full of fucking like fives.
[125:55.84]Oh, wait.
[125:56.48]Oh, you got money.
[125:57.92]Who else is in here?
[126:05.06]Shit!
[126:13.48]Alright.
[126:15.82]Crime resolved.
[126:17.18]I got it.
[126:21.50]I have to interrogate.
[126:22.30]I keep forgetting to do that.
[126:37.91]Kind of.
[126:38.19]Alright.
[126:41.01]I have to interrogate somebody.
[126:42.07]So what do we got?
[126:45.28]I can go this way.
[126:51.52]Yeah, let's go this way.
[126:52.84]Is this supposed to be the same guy?
[126:54.65]Am I just a menace to this person?
[126:57.41]Thanks.
[127:16.98]The walk sign was not there.
[127:18.80]Oh shit!
[128:04.05]What did you say?
[128:04.49]I want some more of those moves.
[128:16.28]Those moves are cool.
[128:29.15]Interrogate somebody.
[128:30.51]I won't do it.
[128:31.15]I just keep killing everyone.
[128:38.95]Come here.
[128:48.23]What do you know about the penguin?
[128:50.93]Fucking asshole.
[129:01.00]Wait, they have stuff here.

[129:57.68]Can I get on the train?
[129:58.36]Yeah, I... I take the train.
[130:15.06]That'd be so weird.
[130:17.07]Honestly, I would just assume that there was, like, a Comic Con going on down the street.
[130:21.37]Like, this is not Nightwing.
[130:24.61]This is a guy going to a convention.
[130:25.75]He didn't even let anybody on.
[130:39.00]Dance is locked?
[130:39.96]Come on.
[130:44.45]What is it?
[130:44.91]You got to get a clap or something.
[130:46.81]Thank you.
[131:32.36]The fucking absolute terror.
[131:36.90]The absolute horror.
[131:39.20]That was so funny.
[131:46.26]Okay, I need to- I gotta stop a crime.
[131:58.25]This is fun, alright.
[132:00.16]I need another crime.
[132:01.52]Did I solve all the crimes?
[132:02.90]No, there's one right over here.
[132:19.09]Are they in the building or are they on the roof?
[132:25.49]I want to throw somebody off the roof so bad.
[132:27.91]Oh, you better.
[132:28.39]I'm throwing this person off the roof into the fucking ocean.
[132:35.97]Excuse me?
[132:36.63]What happened?
[132:47.44]So that's what level they are.
[132:52.08]Alright.
[132:53.26]Come on, put him under the fan!
[133:23.98]Why didn't he stop running?
[133:27.54]Don't kill me.
[133:28.94]He's got... Are you gonna punch?
[133:35.64]Hey, thanks for the help.
[133:36.62]Hey, watch out for that ledge over there.
[133:41.51]Aww.
[133:42.23]He threw a grenade?
[133:42.95]He threw a rocket?
[134:00.91]Alright, interrogate.
[134:02.65]Interrogate.
[134:03.99]How do I interrogate?
[134:07.65]Where's the penguin?
[134:08.91]You're dead.
[134:09.39]Never mind.
[134:10.22]Why can't I interrogate?
[134:12.64]This guy's a fucking maniac.
[134:15.60]This guy's a maniac.
[134:19.86]By the way, thanks for Warner Brothers for sponsoring the stream.
[134:23.02]Gotham Knights will be available tomorrow.
[134:27.19]Xbox.
[134:28.15]PlayStation.

[134:33.03]I have a 3090.
[134:33.72]Be curious.
[134:36.10]It is running pretty well.
[134:37.82]I would say it's running 60.
[134:39.00]Been a few drops here and there, but forget about my internet.
[134:48.00]It's a whole nother story.
[134:49.38]I need to interrogate someone.
[134:54.16]Are you humble bragging?
[134:55.30]No, no, no, no.
[134:56.00]I'm just saying that if you look at this and you go, oh wow, okay, this is running great.
[135:01.04]I just want to make sure you know what card that I have.
[135:03.93]Right?
[135:19.85]I'm like falling.
[135:20.53]Oh my god, Nightwing.
[135:21.47]You can't go down the stairs?
[135:37.93]You know why I'm here?
[135:39.07]Hand it over.
[135:41.83]Tell me.
[135:42.17]Interrogate.
[135:45.35]Your pal, Dr. Langstrom, was murdered recently.
[135:48.05]What do you know about it?
[135:50.68]I don't know who burned the dock.
[135:52.74]His research was top secret.
[135:54.28]Even my boss didn't know I was doing work for him.
[135:56.32]Take him out.
[135:57.08]Maybe it was just an accident.
[135:58.62]Thank you.
[136:00.20]I took him out.
[136:02.28]Wait, are you still fighting?
[136:04.80]What the hell?
[136:12.97]He was about to say, don't let him grab you.
[136:15.66]Why?
[136:15.84]Because I'm going to interrogate you.
[136:35.07]Yeah, so for tomorrow... We'll start earlier tomorrow to try to avoid the internet problem that could happen at the nighttime, so... We'll start at probably 2 o'clock tomorrow.
[136:44.07]2 p.m.
[136:44.35]Pacific.
[136:44.67]Instead of 4.
[136:48.79]I mean, that was... You okay?
[136:55.94]Alright, so I got a little bit of info.
[136:59.60]I need a little bit more info.
[137:14.71]I do want to play as the other characters.
[137:18.01]We'll do that tomorrow.
[137:19.31]Alright, that way.
[137:32.48]What was that?
[137:33.08]Oh, it's a bat wing.
[137:33.74]Cool.
[137:34.32]Alright, it's right below.
[137:40.50]Alright, one of these guys has intel, I think.
[137:51.11]Can't reach him here.
[137:51.85]Alright, whatever.
[137:58.25]They keep talking about me bugging out.
[138:13.46]Which one of you has intel?
[138:19.06]You just threw Molotov at your friend.
[138:21.80]You guys, seriously.
[138:24.60]You don't have intel.
[138:25.24]Do you have intel?
[138:26.48]Do you know anything?
[138:27.88]Do you know anything?
[138:30.26]Do you know Harvey yet?
[138:32.21]You seen him?
[138:32.53]Do you know where he is?
[138:44.57]Come here.
[138:44.85]What do you know?
[138:47.23]Do you know anything?
[138:54.28]That was fucking awesome.
[138:55.87]I mean, don't tell me that wasn't cool.
[138:58.17]That was cool.
[138:59.05]That was really cool.
[139:00.81]That was actually really cool.
[139:08.49]Find something that's a higher level.
[139:11.59]This one's red.
[139:12.35]Why is this one red?
[139:27.50]There's a photo mode, too.
[139:28.70]How do I do it?
[139:31.01]Ooh.
[139:34.05]I gotta get a cool shot.
[139:35.09]Ready?
[139:35.45]Okay, up and down.
[139:40.96]Focal length.
[140:11.05]Harley, Freeze, Clayface, Arkham, Cobble, Pot.
[140:26.87]These are all... Wait.
[140:35.64]Pretty sick.
[140:38.87]Hide heroes.
[140:39.91]Facial expression?
[140:40.87]Wait.
[140:50.42]I like that one.
[140:57.10]This is like an awkward selfie you take thinking that you look good for your Tinder profile.
[141:02.74]And then you go, fuck, I need to be in a picture with other people.
[141:06.78]Like, shit, I have to be in a photo with other people.
[141:10.37]Right?
[141:21.17]Body pose?
[141:22.27]No.
[141:26.50]This is way more detailed than it has any right to be.
[141:30.96]You can bring a light source?
[141:58.11]That's pretty good.
[142:06.42]It kind of looks like somebody got a picture of him that he didn't know.
[142:09.28]He's like, wow, I'm surprised you're taking this from up here.
[142:15.02]Hold on.
[142:24.22]Yeah, like a big telephoto lens zooming in on him.
[142:51.95]That's really good.
[142:52.91]That's very detailed.
[142:54.67]Cool.
[142:59.12]I want to take a picture during something crazy.
[143:02.28]Well, now that I know you can do that.
[143:03.20]Alright.
[143:03.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[143:04.02]I'm going the wrong way.
[143:07.10]I want to go in there.
[143:07.82]Yeah.
[143:08.24]Go over there.
[143:16.98]You could probably get some really good photos with how much there is to do with that.
[143:22.32]Especially you can take the heroes out.
[143:23.48]You can just remove everybody.
[143:26.04]Frame up some good photography.
[143:28.42]Alright, let's do the one that's over here.
[143:41.57]Oh, you can do a springboard.
[143:47.72]Alright, so where are we going?
[143:49.70]Right here.
[143:56.66]Jesus.
[143:57.04]There's a lot of people here.
[144:06.25]Defeat enemies?
[144:06.89]This is like rock music?
[144:28.75]He's alive.
[144:31.07]Oh, come on.
[144:31.89]What?
[144:33.57]Who even heard that?
[144:36.77]There's way too many people here.
[144:38.11]I gotta get out of here.
[144:51.80]Oh, those explode.
[144:58.31]That sucks.
[145:00.63]No, that's so many materials to lose.
[145:02.87]Alright, don't die.
[145:15.14]People are... Are the cops arresting?
[145:20.71]Who's fighting who here?
[145:30.12]I'm trying to... Okay.
[145:30.98]I love that move so much.
[145:33.92]Okay.
[145:54.12]Oh, you throw it in the air and catch it.
[145:55.76]Alright, interrogate.
[145:57.18]Let's go.
[145:57.56]What do you know?
[145:58.50]Okay.
[145:58.78]How much intel do I need to do a mission?
[145:59.86]Let's see.
[146:22.08]Batman's last case.
[146:23.74]Weird science.
[146:26.90]Oh, okay.
[146:27.26]We gotta interrogate freaks.
[146:29.68]Where am I now?
[146:36.67]Armor truck robbery going on right now?
[146:44.87]What is this?
[146:46.89]Crime scene?
[146:47.93]I'm gonna do the armor truck.
[146:49.52]Let's go.
[147:13.39]Do the Bane voice?
[147:14.49]Okay.
[147:16.13]I did promise I would do it.
[147:22.01]Oh, you think darkness is your ally.
[147:24.43]But today, we will find you and we will kill you.
[147:29.71]You are absolutely able to believe that you could defeat the League of Shadows.
[147:38.35]Ha ha!
[147:38.97]Ha ha!
[147:39.51]Ha ha!
[147:40.03]Ha ha!
[147:40.31]Ha ha!
[147:46.75]I think my game crashed.
[147:47.85]No.
[147:50.99]Why can't I walk forward?
[148:07.36]Um, I think I'm trapped in a box.
[148:13.88]What happened to me?
[148:14.86]Where am I?
[148:19.76]Oh, I clipped into a wall.
[148:21.12]Okay.
[148:21.90]That's funny.
[148:42.01]Oh.
[148:42.21]Crime.
[148:42.49]I don't... What did I even just do to him?
[148:46.09]I'm just lying down.
[148:57.47]Language what's this rated?
[148:58.61]Close Call it a tie okay, let's call it a tie sure
[149:37.25]It's called a tie.
[149:39.51]It's called a tie.
[150:03.63]I was trying... Never mind, whatever.
[150:06.97]Oh man, that was bad.
[150:08.33]That was a big head injury.
[150:11.19]You leaned into that one, though.
[150:12.49]Come on.
[150:14.15]I was trying to hold... See, I was going to push them into the car.
[150:19.60]I was going to just throw her into the car.
[150:21.34]But it didn't happen.
[150:24.56]I was waiting for a car.
[150:38.38]Armor truck.
[150:45.38]Let me get a good photo, too.
[150:47.08]I need a good Nightwing photo.
[150:48.00]How about, like,
[151:06.74]That looks kinda weird.
[151:14.56]This is like a skateboard video.
[151:55.37]Look at all this shit.
[151:56.49]Oh my god, really?
[151:57.75]Ugh.
[152:12.04]Pixel 1998?
[152:24.55]Is it going to be snowing?
[152:25.19]Hey, you guys remember the part of the movie where Nightwing cannonballed into the pool off the top of the Gotham City Tower?
[152:39.69]It was crazy.
[152:41.58]It was a really weird scene, too.
[152:58.85]I can't do body pose.
[152:59.93]I so badly want it.
[153:13.31]Oh, that's perfect.
[153:14.91]I don't know which one's better.
[153:16.11]This one's pretty good too.
[153:18.45]I like this one.
[153:40.84]Ah, that's a pretty good thumbnail.
[153:41.76]Alright, I gotta get a cool photo here, too.
[153:54.29]Get out of the way.
[153:56.67]Okay.
[154:16.83]Why did this explode?
[154:19.86]Wait, what happened over here?
[154:22.06]Why did this explode?
[154:23.20]I'm so confused.
[154:26.12]Hold on, take the filters off.
[154:36.16]Whoa, that was cool.
[154:44.58]How have none of you died from this?
[154:52.39]That's actually... Oh, and he still has the smile.
[154:54.89]I like that.
[155:01.43]That's a good one.
[155:07.84]Let me change the smile.
[155:17.59]You can't even believe he's doing it.
[155:39.50]Perfect.
[155:40.60]Make him look bored?
[156:03.61]That just looks odd.
[156:04.45]Yeah, it looks just weird.
[156:13.80]Alright, let's go.
[156:14.26]Oh shit!
[156:14.62]That would have been awesome.
[157:39.66]What?
[157:41.86]Jeremy, you're live right now.
[157:45.58]Yeah.
[157:47.84]What do you want?
[157:48.32]What do you want?
[157:49.88]What?
[157:50.10]I mean, yeah, I know I'm live.
[157:52.78]What's wrong?
[157:53.60]I'm taking a picture of this lady getting kicked in the face.
[158:05.03]What?
[158:19.26]Don't let him.
[158:19.76]Okay.
[158:20.64]Don't let him get the money.
[158:25.30]No, I can't.
[158:32.58]Why?
[158:33.08]Oh, because he.
[158:34.94]Oh, I'm dead.
[158:39.91]Shit.
[158:42.55]It's alright.
[158:42.89]It's fine.
[158:43.25]It's fine.
[158:46.57]Losing more of my goddamn currency.
[158:51.80]I think I failed it.
[158:53.51]I can't do it again.
[158:56.13]I'm going to go back to Wayne Enterprises, whatever it is, and progress the story.
[159:03.46]That's what I'm doing.
[159:04.12]That's what's happening.
[159:06.06]Let's go.
[159:06.58]I failed it.
[159:07.32]It's not available anymore.
[159:08.20]They're not still robbing that place.
[159:11.81]Okay, let's go.
[159:30.63]I'm really glad the internet fixed itself.
[159:34.13]Yeah, I'll check on... How am I only have one crime stopped?
[159:38.33]And I stopped like five?
[159:42.21]Ooh.
[159:50.76]That one's pretty sick.
[159:56.18]Common power 12 health.
[159:59.29]Okay.
[160:01.33]Yeah, let's put this on.
[160:02.07]That looks cool.
[160:09.67]What is that?
[160:11.29]I didn't know I had that.
[160:16.39]Beyond suit?
[160:18.78]This is just way better, right?
[160:21.44]Why did I even make the other one?
[160:26.04]Okay, I got points to put in.
[160:29.74]Um, alright, melee.
[160:30.94]No.
[160:33.48]Ranged.
[160:36.00]Darts?
[160:36.38]I mean, these use, okay, definitely these.
[160:45.34]Offer minimum stats, a good way to keep your basic kit up to date.
[160:48.18]Okay, sounds good.
[160:49.60]Alright, what do I want for points here?
[160:55.68]I was gonna do Acrobat.
[160:58.96]So we'll do this.
[161:01.71]Aerial attack damage is increased.
[161:03.17]Very cool.
[161:03.55]Looking forward to it.
[161:08.12]Email.
[161:08.44]Hey there.
[161:11.06]Boyo.
[161:13.19]Uh, fiercely typing on my way to next class.
[161:15.21]See what you're doing next weekend.
[161:16.49]I have a wee break.
[161:18.01]Thought we could get a cuppa.
[161:19.79]Coming back to Bloodhaven till Sunday night to see some folks and thought maybe you would like to be one of them.
[161:25.07]Unless you're expecting one of your infamous Grayson emergencies.
[161:29.37]Have you seen the old super speeding bullet running around out there?
[161:33.37]Friend of, it says he's in Bloodhaven.
[161:34.88]Imagine that.
[161:36.30]Can't be good news when the big boys start looking our way.
[161:39.02]So be careful.
[161:39.46]Talking about Superman?
[161:44.68]The flash?
[161:47.54]Have you seen the old super speeding bullet round running about out there?
[161:53.00]That's the flash.
[161:53.58]Are there more heroes in the game?
[162:03.02]Okay.
[162:05.33]Alright, I got the new suit.
[162:08.35]Here's the evidence board.
[162:09.29]Leeds, okay.
[162:18.87]Alright, so I still have to do this part.
[162:20.68]Interrogate the freaks in this area.
[162:24.34]So I gotta go up there.
[162:25.76]And then that's pretty much it.
[162:26.78]Unless... Did I get any new things up here?
[162:33.43]No.
[162:37.27]I just... I don't think I interrogated enough people.
[162:39.51]Yeah, alright.
[162:40.17]So I know where to go.
[162:40.71]Why are they just called freaks?
[162:44.66]Yeah, they're just called freaks.
[162:49.11]Alright, new suit, new gear.
[162:50.75]Let's check it out.
[163:06.08]Okay.
[163:07.64]After this mission... Ooh.
[163:10.28]Ooh.
[163:20.46]What is he?
[163:20.86]Okay.
[163:22.90]So I need to go... It was up here, right?
[163:34.77]It was up here, right?
[163:35.33]Wasn't it?
[163:37.83]Case file.
[163:39.97]Little chat.
[163:40.61]So it's like over here.
[163:42.61]Like right here.
[163:50.13]This is a long ways away.
[163:51.11]Get in the car.
[164:00.39]Thank you.
[164:00.93]Turn around.
[164:24.50]Alright, on the right track.
[164:34.47]Okay, that's a jump the other way.
[165:06.92]Can I drive through here?
[165:07.78]Are you sure?
[165:08.52]Dude, are you sure?
[165:10.59]Okay.

[168:11.60]Somebody hit me off the bike.
[168:12.92]Jesus.
[168:19.73]Uh, the game's broken.
[168:25.90]I'm not gonna... I'm done doing this.
[168:27.70]I broke the game, I think.
[168:32.49]In what scenario would you be able to take this photo?
[168:35.81]I'm not... It's too fun to take stupid pictures.
[169:34.12]Let's go!
[169:47.06]Shit ow
[170:20.41]Oh, that was a double swing if I... Did you see that?
[170:22.18]I hit him with both feet.
[171:16.41]Batman would have obliterated this guy by now.
[171:24.80]Say that, he's... We only just figured that out like... A couple hours ago, buddy.
[171:33.47]Come on, don't... Alright, I need to interrogate somebody down here.
[171:41.86]Batman's like level 50.
[171:42.92]Yeah, you can't say that.
[171:45.69]Doesn't work like that.
[171:47.79]Alright, I need to interrogate somebody here.
[171:55.78]Can you see me still?
[172:18.58]I just dodged that.
[172:20.86]Alright, don't kill that guy.
[172:35.60]I need to interrogate that guy.
[172:45.95]Holy shit, that almost killed me instantly.
[172:56.14]Ah!
[173:33.12]These guys are so tanky.
[173:41.69]Die!
[173:43.65]No, no, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[173:44.47]I mean, defeat!
[173:45.69]Not supposed to be killing people, I forgot.
[173:52.44]Can you grab the big guys?
[174:07.49]I can't grab him.
[174:14.39]Oh.
[174:21.28]Oh, shit.
[174:21.74]Alright.
[174:22.32]Here we go.
[174:22.70]Why does he have like a face?
[174:34.57]Kidnapping in progress.
[174:36.75]What?
[174:37.73]Where?
[174:38.82]I didn't interrogate anybody.
[174:46.48]Was this kidnapping in progress?
[174:52.03]How did I not interrogate?
[174:52.81]I thought there was the, um... Alright, let me get one more thing of intel.
[175:06.08]So for tomorrow, I'm going to run a poll before the stream turns off.
[175:10.88]So we're going to start at like 2 o'clock Pacific tomorrow.
[175:15.54]Damn.
[175:18.07]And the idea is, I mean, I could play Crash Bandicoot again.
[175:23.79]Or should we do something else?
[175:27.03]Neon White.
[175:27.53]We could start with Neon White tomorrow.
[175:37.83]Neon white.
[175:40.41]Vampire Survivor's got its 1.0 update.
[175:42.37]There's also Brotato.
[175:44.86]Which I want to play.
[175:48.12]We'll figure it out.
[175:48.60]Breath of the Wild.
[175:51.34]I don't know.
[175:52.88]Maybe.
[175:53.16]Oh, I want to play like a horror game too.
[175:57.11]Maybe we'll play the Papa Combo game tomorrow.
[175:58.93]Maybe Deadly Night.
[176:07.89]Alright, yeah.
[176:08.27]Put a poll up.
[176:09.35]It's gonna be Deadly Night.
[176:12.58]Which is a puppet combo horror game.
[176:16.82]Continue Crash Bandicoot 4.
[176:24.00]Or Neon White.
[176:29.25]Wait, why am I... They're doing like a news segment?
[176:32.29]That guy has a shotgun.
[176:36.01]Okay, get out.
[176:36.61]Get out.
[176:36.95]Don't fight here.
[176:40.54]Were they just doing, like, a news interview?
[176:42.98]Why did I just come over here?
[176:44.02]Some fighting people.
[176:56.27]Get out!
[176:57.51]Stop!
[176:58.01]Just... Okay, I gotta get out of here.
[177:00.93]I have to get the fuck out of here.
[177:08.84]I thought those were criminals.
[177:11.06]Give me the car.
[177:15.42]Get me out.
[177:24.35]Okay, I need... Speaking of gangs, where are they?
[177:29.59]Down here.
[177:47.30]What's up?
[177:49.06]Alright, keep that number 4 alive.
[178:25.73]Come here.
[178:26.85]Now give me some info.
[178:29.13]Finally.
[178:29.49]You got it.
[178:53.77]Might as well talk to her in the meantime.
[178:55.65]Sending coordinates now.
[178:56.89]Okay.
[178:58.81]Sick.
[179:06.20]Is this a boss fight maybe?
[179:07.08]This could be a boss fight.
[179:15.41]Oh, confirm the poll options.
[179:17.11]It was Crash Bandicoot 4 Continued Playthrough.
[179:20.36]It was Neon White.
[179:23.84]And... Vampire Survivors slash Brotato.
[179:38.01]Deadly Knight.
[179:39.51]That's too many.
[179:41.01]Alright, we're gonna make it easy.
[179:43.73]Um...
[179:45.63]I'm going to literally make it simple for you.
[179:46.87]We're playing the puppet combo game tomorrow.
[179:49.65]But, mmm, no.
[179:52.85]I want to do that at night.
[179:53.59]I don't want to do that at like 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[179:58.08]I don't want it to be like 2 p.m.
[180:00.64]in the afternoon.
[180:01.12]I want it to be scary at night.
[180:04.04]Alright, I've got a plan for you.
[180:05.60]Here's the plan.
[180:07.65]You are to choose.
[180:09.17]This is what's happening tomorrow.
[180:11.45]Tomorrow at 2pm, we're going to start with something.
[180:15.35]Then we're going to move to Gotham Knights.
[180:17.19]And then after Gotham Knights, we're going to do the Puppet Combo game.
[180:22.51]So, we're going to start with something, though.
[180:24.39]What can I play for like an hour or two?
[180:25.81]What can I play for like an hour?
[180:29.69]I've got it.
[180:30.43]Done.
[180:31.31]We're going to play... Listen.
[180:33.05]I don't even need to pull.
[180:34.41]We're going to play the Vampire Survivors 1.0 update.
[180:39.83]Gotham Knights.
[180:41.01]And then we're going to end with Puppet Combo's Deadly Knight.
[180:45.45]There you go.
[180:46.01]Who needs a pole?
[180:46.57]We already got it.
[180:47.01]I'm going to fast travel to here.
[180:53.80]It's only my third knight.
[181:13.21]Alright.
[181:17.25]Three meditated crimes revealed.
[181:25.76]What's that mean?
[181:26.38]I want to talk because I feel like this is a boss fight.
[181:30.20]I'm going for it.
[181:41.67]Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest.
[181:50.66]Ooh.
[181:51.00]Uh, give me the bike.
[182:07.15]And again, this game is available tomorrow.
[182:12.23]on PS5, Xbox, both versions of Xbox, PC.
[182:22.34]Get out of the fucking way.
[182:23.78]Alright.
[182:39.40]It's time for our first boss fight.
[182:40.60]That'd be kind of cool.
[182:48.40]First boss fight.
[182:49.72]Kind of cool.
[183:00.27]Yeah, this is on PC.
[183:04.35]Alright, come on.
[183:05.14]Boss fight.
[183:08.35]You played as the other characters yet?
[183:09.85]No, I mean Nightwing's one of my favorite DC characters, so.
[183:12.61]Played with him.
[183:12.99]We'll play with the other ones tomorrow.
[183:14.69]Pretty sure Batman told you that you and your League weren't welcome in Gotham, Talia.
[183:20.36]I'm not their commander.
[183:22.80]They cast me out.
[183:25.90]Hard to believe leadership of the League isn't hereditary.
[183:30.48]You saying you didn't get the job after you asked, Rache?
[183:35.15]My late father insisted Bruce would be the next head of the League, despite his refusal.
[183:41.12]Since that ill-fated... How come Nightwing looks like this?
[183:43.88]All the League can agree on this.
[183:45.92]It's a different costume.
[183:47.30]It's a different suit.
[183:49.20]Why would Rache kill his next in line?
[183:52.02]None of this makes sense.
[183:54.14]I agree.
[183:55.23]It was an irrational win.
[183:56.99]I warned him the Batman would be his downfall.
[184:00.14]But repeated exposure to the Lazarus pits breaks down a subject's mind.
[184:06.55]Eventually, their true self is erased.
[184:12.69]I know you, Talia.
[184:14.57]You could have used your father as a puppet if you wanted to.
[184:17.77]There's something else here.
[184:19.18]Consider it a logical choice.
[184:21.76]A painless end for him meant closure for the League.
[184:25.70]And for me.
[184:28.56]Now they
[184:30.00]Why do I like Nightwing?
[184:31.08]I like his weapons.
[184:32.16]I have other matters to attend to.
[184:43.74]Boss fight.
[184:46.84]The funeral was tasteful.
[184:50.09]I'm sure Bruce would have appreciated it.
[184:51.99]Leave him where he is.
[184:54.43]You still haven't answered my question.
[184:56.99]No, but I can ask you.
[185:00.70]Why would an apprentice to the cowl break into the morgue?
[185:04.86]I know you weren't following me.
[185:08.81]It's an ongoing investigation.
[185:10.39]I look like a ghoul.
[185:12.91]Left behind by Bruce.
[185:16.38]I wish you the best of luck.
[185:18.02]You'll be needing it soon.
[185:19.98]Because once the League regains its footing, Gotham will be in its sights.
[185:34.32]What happened?
[185:36.46]This isn't good.
[185:38.56]Belfry, Talia's got something going on.
[185:41.70]Surprising, but also not.
[185:44.04]Is that why you didn't ask her about Langstrom?
[185:46.31]No, boss.
[185:46.65]That's alright.
[185:47.03]I didn't want to give her any leads.
[185:49.29]Back to the bell.
[185:50.77]Alright.
[185:53.05]You guys ready to call it?
[185:56.80]Come back tomorrow afternoon.
[185:57.64]We'll come earlier.
[185:58.66]We'll start earlier tomorrow.
[186:04.01]I want to start earlier because I want to go a little longer tomorrow.
[186:11.31]Oh, I didn't even do any crimes.
[186:19.37]Sorry about the internet.
[186:23.47]It always sucks.
[186:24.43]It's always so frustrating, but it's all good.
[186:26.52]It seemed to get cleared up after like 20 minutes or so.
[186:28.90]So I'm happy about that at least.
[186:34.71]Do we think it's legit?
[186:37.41]Bruce never talked to me about it.
[186:39.85]When Bruce worked with criminals, he didn't exactly keep us in the loop.
[186:43.52]I'm curious about Red Hood.
[186:45.30]But it's also not crazy to think that Harley made this up.
[186:48.06]Just play it.
[186:50.24]Then we'll know.
[186:56.84]Harley.
[186:59.04]Hiya, Betsy.
[187:02.27]Been a while.
[187:04.54]It's weird, because I heard a rumor that you were dead.
[187:09.47]Oh boy.
[187:12.77]Anyway, I got what you wanted.
[187:15.45]Hope that ain't what got you dead.
[187:16.84]So come visit me at Blackgate.
[187:21.06]Wait.
[187:30.10]Hasn't Harley Quinn been out of Gotham ever since, you know, her ex?
[187:38.94]Killed me?
[187:39.36]Isn't that what you meant?
[187:42.94]Wait, what?
[187:45.58]Rumor has it she did some government thing.
[187:48.22]Went straight.
[187:49.58]Ish.
[187:51.24]She's got something.
[187:52.04]Then we go find Harley.
[187:57.49]He's literally alive though, yeah.
[187:59.53]Yeah, after I got after he killed me, yeah.
[188:05.41]So live, but you know it hurt.
[188:12.17]Do you think this Harley thing is really worth following up on?
[188:16.49]Harley may be out of her fake fan.
[188:18.15]Yeah.
[188:18.25]Don't know the Red Hood origin.
[188:19.89]I mean, I think I know.
[188:25.74]Yeah, but why would she help?
[188:27.58]Do I know?
[188:28.72]Or us.
[188:29.00]I don't know what it is.
[188:45.63]Oh, okay.
[188:46.75]Oh, that's right.
[188:47.33]Yeah.
[188:48.13]I could what?
[188:50.55]He went to yours when you could visit his grave.
[188:57.06]Who's the original Robin?
[188:58.72]It's Red Hood, right?
[188:59.62]Red Hood's the original Robin, like the first Robin.
[189:02.14]You haven't.
[189:03.31]And then Nightwing's the second Robin, and then... Right?
[189:12.46]Dick is the original Robin.
[189:13.84]Oh, no, Jason Todd was the second.
[189:17.48]And then who's the Robin in this game?
[189:28.19]Dick was first, Jason second.
[189:30.43]Alright, Tim, right, right, right.
[189:32.21]Sometimes that's gotta be, I gotta remember.
[189:38.42]Alright.
[189:39.22]Very cool, very cool.
[189:41.14]So, I'll wrap it up here.
[189:43.05]I'll see you guys tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock Pacific.
[189:45.03]We'll play more Gotham Knights.
[189:47.99]Again, thanks to Warner Brothers.
[189:50.79]Games available tomorrow.
[189:53.23]This obviously is sponsored.
[189:55.20]Sponsored tomorrow as well.
[189:57.24]It's available for everything.
[190:01.52]I'm obviously going to keep playing it.
[190:05.21]I'm sponsored to play it, so we'll keep going.
[190:08.51]But again, it's not going to be the whole thing tomorrow.
[190:10.69]It will be for a couple of hours.
[190:14.27]And before that, we'll play Vampire Survivors.
[190:16.43]And after that, we'll do Puppet Combo's Deadly Night.
[190:19.69]That's what we will end the stream with tomorrow.
[190:22.93]It's probably going to be a meaty one tomorrow, I would say.
[190:24.79]Going to be playing three different games.
[190:28.90]And strapping tomorrow.
[190:30.30]Yeah.
[190:30.52]That's it.
[190:39.33]Thanks again, Warner Brothers.
[190:43.96]There is a... There's multiplayer, too.
[190:46.26]I gotta investigate some of this shit.
[190:50.94]But yeah.
[190:51.86]See you tomorrow.
[190:53.14]Good night.
[190:57.60]Again, sorry about the internet.
[191:01.23]So hard to not bite my controller when that happens.
[191:09.10]Oh, I had fun.
[191:10.16]I did.
[191:14.72]I would be lying to you if I said I didn't.
[191:18.52]Regardless of, you know, a sponsorship, it was kind of fun to run around and hit stuff.
[191:23.05]Some of the open world goofiness was, I mean, it was funny.
[191:26.99]It was a lot of fun.
[191:28.01]If it looks like it's something you're into, then it is.
[191:31.61]If not, then it's not.
[191:37.14]Open world games tend to just bring out some of the best in random AI shenanigans.
[191:43.02]It's one of my favorite things in any video game.
[191:46.35]It's just driving around and having people just react.
[191:48.99]Just the AI just decides to do stuff.
[191:51.33]It's my favorite thing.
[192:07.71]Yeah, have a good night.
[192:10.01]See you tomorrow.
[192:10.53]2 p.m.
[192:11.15]Pacific.
[192:12.05]Vampire Survivors for about an hour.
[192:16.06]Knights for about two and a half maybe hours.
[192:19.14]Maybe.
[192:19.46]We'll see.
[192:20.90]After that.
[192:23.18]Deadly night.
[192:26.38]We'll see.
[192:31.32]Thanks for the subs.
[192:32.51]There were a couple of raids that came in too.
[192:37.79]So thanks for the raids.
[192:38.47]Thanks for the subs.
[192:41.00]Obviously.
[192:41.38]We'll see you soon.
[192:43.82]2 p.m.
[192:44.04]Pacific.
[192:44.94]Good night.
[192:45.62]Goodbye.
[192:47.70]Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[192:52.34]Well, it's night for everybody.
[192:54.38]So, good night.
[193:34.04]you
[194:08.93]you
[194:39.43]you
