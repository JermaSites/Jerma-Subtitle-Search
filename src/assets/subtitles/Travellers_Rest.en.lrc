[ve:60.16.100]

[00:19.52]Oh, hello!
[00:22.12]How are you?
[00:26.48]How's it going?
[00:32.41]You got peanut butter voice?
[00:33.71]Yeah, a little.
[00:34.63]Better?
[00:50.13]Yeah, I'm a little early.
[00:51.05]I'm a day early.
[00:54.01]But I just felt like turning it on.
[00:56.38]That's what we're doing.
[00:58.70]Day five of wisdom teeth recovery.
[01:07.00]Oh shit.
[01:09.57]It usually takes a while.
[01:12.09]Usually like a week or two, right?
[01:16.49]He's obsessed with being early.
[01:24.73]Cozy eye strain?
[01:26.03]What?
[01:31.65]Yeah, today we're gonna play... It's been on the list for a little while.
[01:37.31]Called Traveler's Rest.
[01:41.41]Sort of reminds me of...
[01:44.75]Oh, there's an eyestrain tag.
[01:48.97]There's an eyestrain tag?
[01:52.03]Why would you want to look that up as a tag?
[01:54.71]Oh, yeah, I'm going to search for some streams that I think are... Yeah, I'm on Twitch.
[02:02.04]Let me look for some streams.
[02:03.94]Eyestrain.
[02:04.46]That seems like a tag you wouldn't want to go look for.
[02:13.86]It's for warnings?
[02:15.18]Oh, because right now it says English and eyestrain.
[02:18.25]Those are the only two tags.
[02:20.05]That's funny.
[02:23.47]To be honest, that's how I found you.
[02:29.10]Do I take game suggestions?
[02:30.42]Yes.
[02:32.06]There's a recommended channel in the Discord.
[02:37.61]channel is just open to the public so if you have a game that that I have not already played then by all means put it up there definitely make sure to search in that channel make sure that it's not the same thing that's been posted a few times but I do I go in there frequently I mean by frequently I mean at least
[03:04.20]at least a couple times a month.
[03:05.57]I'll just kind of open it.
[03:07.37]It's funny, I use the recommended channel in my Discord more than any other channel in the Discord.
[03:14.10]It's like one of the only uses that I have for that Discord for me personally is what's in the recommended?
[03:20.84]Let's go look for a little bit.
[03:23.19]At least once a year, yeah.
[03:29.62]But what I usually do is I just kind of start from the most recent one and just go up.
[03:33.98]Just take a look, see.
[03:40.03]I usually go up as long as it's been since I was there last time.
[03:44.01]From what I remember, at least.
[03:49.07]Rude streamer doesn't engage with his audience.
[03:52.99]OK.
[03:56.05]Yeah.
[04:01.93]True, true, true.
[04:08.31]Insane streamer puts boundaries on how he feels, yeah.
[04:12.38]I think that's important though.
[04:20.30]I think that's very important.
[04:23.06]Eye strain.
[04:27.12]How am I doing?
[04:27.56]I'm doing good.
[04:28.10]I'm doing good.
[04:31.07]It's been kind of a wild few days.
[04:34.21]Very exciting stuff.
[04:36.91]Kind of overwhelming and in a lot of ways.
[04:41.60]But it's been, it's been, it's been great.
[04:46.90]I also, no tannins?
[04:48.76]No, no, no tannins tonight.
[04:49.80]At least not that I have, right?
[04:56.01]Okay, there is another little thing I want to talk about with Bridal Beasts.
[04:59.56]There's no, I promise, no PowerPoint presentation tonight.
[05:05.44]So, but, like, the four or five sentences that I want to say.
[05:10.82]No, no PowerPoint, sorry.
[05:12.02]I know.
[05:24.65]When is Breath of the Wild?
[05:25.65]I know.
[05:27.03]I don't know.
[05:27.43]I don't know.
[05:29.15]I need to like... I just have to play it.
[05:30.79]Like, I don't know.
[05:31.33]I want to play this.
[05:32.01]There's like all this stuff I just want to play.
[05:35.71]You know what's weird about Breath of the Wild?
[05:37.12]I'm going to be honest.
[05:37.78]Let's... Okay.
[05:39.08]I'm going to completely just give you the total transparency.
[05:43.72]This happens to me a lot.
[05:44.66]It probably happens to a lot of people here.
[05:46.06]A lot of times I will get 30, 40, 50, 60% of the way through a game and then not play it for a little while.
[05:58.73]And then going back is almost like shit.
[06:01.47]It's almost like I walked out of the theater in the middle of the movie.
[06:06.39]And going back to watch that whole movie again at some point, right?
[06:09.97]Oh, yeah, okay.
[06:10.99]I'm going to go back and I'm going to watch... Okay, I'm going to watch Infinity War.
[06:14.95]I walked out in the middle of that movie, but... You know what?
[06:18.85]I'm going to give it a chance.
[06:19.61]And you kind of sit through the beginning again.
[06:21.02]You're like, I don't... Who is this guy?
[06:24.60]Who is this?
[06:25.02]It's been like a year since I cared about this.
[06:28.88]Who is that?
[06:29.78]Is Thor?
[06:30.58]Oh, yeah.
[06:31.94]Fuck.
[06:32.90]Maybe I just won't even watch this movie.
[06:36.47]so that happens that does happen to me all the time so I I can't tell you that it's not that I don't want to it's not that I don't want to play Breath of the Wild it's I kind of walked out of the theater halfway through got really busy got a lot of I think that was during the period too where I was didn't stream very much right
[07:01.89]But yeah, I will probably finish it.
[07:04.45]I will.
[07:05.03]I just need to find the reason to kind of put the DVD back in.
[07:11.95]But don't worry.
[07:13.85]Don't worry.
[07:18.45]Probably.
[07:18.81]Can you talk about Brotto Beast's digital version?
[07:29.96]That's one of the things I want to talk about today.
[07:35.34]I want to make sure I don't say anything incorrect.
[07:40.93]But... Uh-oh.
[07:52.21]Hold on a second, everybody.
[07:54.15]Hold on a second, everybody.
[07:56.52]I don't want everyone to freak out right now because I just said the word digital.
[08:02.14]This is not turning into an NFT project.
[08:05.32]This is not going to be like, just hold on a second.
[08:07.64]Let me just talk.
[08:09.19]Let me talk.
[08:09.83]The movie just started.
[08:11.99]The movie just started.
[08:14.60]You can't.
[08:15.24]I'm sorry.
[08:15.54]We're going to use the movie analogy here.
[08:17.87]I'm sorry, Thanos just appeared on screen, and he has the reality stone in his hands, and in the first fucking ten minutes of Infinity War, isn't he just like, oh, I need to collect six more of these, and go, my minions.
[08:32.45]If in the first five minutes of that movie, you're screaming at the screen, going, I can't, why did you, no, you're gonna kill Thor with that thing.
[08:40.74]You're gonna kill Thor with that.
[08:43.10]And it's like, bro, the movie's still going.
[08:44.84]We don't even know, stop, sit down, relax.
[08:51.10]He's got the reality stone.
[08:52.49]He's gonna kill Thor.
[08:53.61]It's like, no, dude, hey, just, hey, shut up, man.
[08:57.43]I'm trying to watch.
[09:00.61]And then you get halfway to the movie and, well, whatever.
[09:03.36]You know, it's the, I don't want to give Infinity War spoilers.
[09:06.14]I don't know why that's the one movie that I refuse to fucking spoil.
[09:11.24]Why?
[09:12.64]Why forever?
[09:14.49]And this has been for years, for years.
[09:19.83]since the first green screen stream back in like what 2019 2018 oh I don't want to I don't want to spoil infinity war so why is that the movie that I don't want to spoil that that's the one and even now like five four five six years later well I don't want to talk about infinity war because I don't want to like spoil it for anybody it's like dude it's alright man I think it's gonna be okay
[09:51.17]But anyways.
[09:53.57]I want to meaningfully talk about this.
[09:55.65]And I think there's enough people here now.
[09:57.83]I don't know.
[09:59.41]There's nothing to announce.
[10:01.37]But so for the game Grotto Beasts, the game Grotto Beasts, because at the very beginning, the very beginning of this project, this project was community merch.
[10:11.26]And it was like, wait, we can build a game on top of it.
[10:13.88]That's kind of cool.
[10:14.84]We can have there be rarities.
[10:16.24]That's kind of cool.
[10:17.96]But I want to make sure that people understand that we are actively exploring other stuff.
[10:23.83]to make it so people can participate because we're not obviously
[10:28.94]It's not like, oh yeah, can I get every single card?
[10:33.56]Every single Grotto Beasts card?
[10:36.78]I don't know, right?
[10:39.66]And I think the idea is people that really want to just play the game, the game portion of this merch, because that's what it is.
[10:47.74]The actual card game, we want to make sure that there is a version that people can just play.
[10:54.24]And whatever that means, we're exploring it right now.
[11:00.69]But the one thing that we're trying to figure out and one thing that we know is probably not going to be in the game or whatever version of whatever this is, when I say game, like the game portion of what we're trying to digitize.
[11:10.16]Is this a mod of an existing platform?
[11:14.46]Is this a standalone app that you just get or buy or whatever?
[11:19.98]I don't know.
[11:22.23]But it was absolutely not... Nothing in these discussions have been... Oh, digital.
[11:29.10]Digital card packs.
[11:31.16]No.
[11:32.10]This would be something that we could just make sure that everybody has access to play it if they wanted to.
[11:37.62]But that's not what's happening.
[11:40.66]This is not a case of we're just taking the physical thing and making it digital to like sell digital card packs.
[11:48.25]That's, that's not what this is.
[11:50.21]That's not what I'm telling you.
[11:51.37]Um, so it would be the version, the thing that we have right now, these 200 cards.
[12:01.91]would just be the thing that you have.
[12:04.91]And whether that's a mod, or whether that's a small kind of... a small digital version that we can make, that's what we want to do.
[12:15.38]No, with no in-app purchases.
[12:16.68]It wouldn't be in-app purchases.
[12:17.40]It wouldn't be anything like that.
[12:21.57]But also, too, we want to make it so it makes sense.
[12:24.41]And that's meaningful.
[12:29.64]And there's plenty of ideas that have floated around.
[12:31.46]But the idea is we want people to participate in the game portion of this merch.
[12:36.26]Even if they... You know, let's say you don't buy a bunch of card packs.
[12:43.76]We want people to be able to experience this event for the community.
[12:48.21]However that is.
[12:48.87]So we're still trying to figure that out.
[13:02.52]NFT.
[13:03.10]No, it's not.
[13:03.84]I'm telling you.
[13:04.38]No, that's not what it is.
[13:10.95]And also, this is an interesting kind of thing to talk about, too, is if we do have a version of the game that's on, that's a mod or that's a standalone thing, whatever.
[13:23.16]then our game designer can continue to be kind of in control of that game portion, right?
[13:29.69]So that's very interesting.
[13:31.23]That means that there's things that can happen to that version.
[13:34.29]It can be, maybe, and I'm speaking completely candidly right now, this is not anything that I'm planning or this is not something we have planned, but maybe the game designer can make balance changes.
[13:48.54]Possible.
[13:49.52]I don't know.
[13:51.50]That's possible.
[13:54.60]But the game portion of this merch product is something that we're trying to figure out how to let anybody really participate and not need to be in the same room.
[14:05.35]Meaningfully, and have it make sense.
[14:07.57]It's a long process.
[14:08.99]We're really trying to figure it out.
[14:10.49]But trust me when I say we are trying to make it so as many people can enjoy this event as we can.
[14:18.84]And that's all I can really say.
[14:24.00]The game designer is sweating right now.
[14:29.88]Is it gonna be a Minecraft mod?
[14:40.93]Well, we definitely, we want it to be easy.
[14:42.39]We want it to be something that's simple.
[14:43.71]That is not, you can just jump in it and make it easy.
[14:46.90]We don't want to make it where, oh yeah.
[14:49.08]And then by the way, while you're in here, you're going to buy packs.
[14:53.02]That's not, we want people to be, this is for the game portion.
[14:58.96]It's not about anything else.
[15:01.64]Because we've seen people go, wait, like the game seems kind of, there is a game.
[15:07.51]What is the game?
[15:09.11]That seems kind of interesting.
[15:10.45]How does it work?
[15:12.49]The rules are being worked on right now.
[15:14.85]Well, the rules being posted are being worked on right now.
[15:17.53]The game is complete.
[15:18.75]It's complete.
[15:19.78]I don't want to say that incorrectly because I have a tendency just to kind of be a stream of consciousness, right?
[15:25.08]The game is, the game portion is done.
[15:28.48]But the rules... We want to make sure there's a place for people to see the rules.
[15:35.20]And what's being worked on right now is the page that we're putting the rules on.
[15:39.48]So that'll be in the next day or two.
[15:40.97]Over the next couple of days.
[15:44.57]I need to make that really clear.
[15:46.59]Like, what the fuck, dude?
[15:47.67]What do you mean you don't know that the rules aren't done?
[15:50.23]The rules are done.
[15:51.93]They've been done for a long time.
[15:54.83]The rulebooks are printed, by the way.
[15:58.47]We're not still making the rules.
[15:59.91]I have a tendency just to fucking talk, and that was not correct.
[16:03.15]The rules are done.
[16:03.74]The rulebook's been printed.
[16:05.02]Don't worry.
[16:09.78]Is he groggy?
[16:13.24]I mean, I showed you the rulebook already.
[16:14.78]I mean, that's full, and that's the way it is.
[16:24.86]Yeah.
[16:26.25]That is how our stance on sort of the digital aspect of this.
[16:33.87]Let us try to get it right.
[16:39.75]I'm going to say four or five sentences.
[16:41.52]Yeah.
[16:43.14]But, you know.
[16:47.70]Is this guy going to play Traveler's Rest or not?
[16:54.83]If the game takes off, I don't even want to go that far.
[16:58.77]Right?
[17:01.20]I don't want to go that far.
[17:04.50]This was a project for this community.
[17:08.56]It's merch for this community.
[17:10.84]And that's my stance on it.
[17:12.20]And that's our stance on it.
[17:14.23]I do not want to tell... I don't want to say like, Oh, wow, look at this.
[17:18.95]And we're going to do this.
[17:19.81]And we're going to do this.
[17:22.37]I can't say that.
[17:23.39]We really can't.
[17:27.46]All I can tell you is it was a really, really crazy project that is finally at its completion.
[17:34.59]And we finally get to show it and finally get to sell it.
[17:41.39]And that is the stance.
[17:43.49]And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you could please get comfortable.
[17:55.69]We're gonna play Traveler's Rest.
[18:09.18]Again, no digital card pack openings.
[18:13.56]I need to make that like one, two, three, four words.
[18:26.67]Uh, this game has been requested a lot.
[18:29.53]Seems pretty comfy.
[18:30.43]Seems like it's got a lot of inspiration from a lot of cool stuff.
[18:41.84]But what if I want to open digital card packs?
[18:46.18]Well, then you're probably going to have to do that somewhere else.
[18:50.77]I don't know, man.
[18:51.75]I don't know what to tell you.
[18:55.41]Alright, let's go.
[18:56.57]New.
[19:00.56]Oh, OK, here we go.
[19:16.53]Beard or no beard, what do you think?
[19:18.95]Definitely mustache for sure.
[19:26.02]I think I'm done.
[19:26.46]Yeah, I like that.
[19:33.78]I like that.
[19:37.12]I like these.
[19:45.19]It's perfect.
[19:50.25]Give him the Nightwing shirt.
[19:54.13]Oh wait, I can do different shirt colors.
[19:55.87]Um, I don't know.
[20:03.68]This looks fine.
[20:10.50]Dude, you've literally just made my father.
[20:12.84]I like this.
[20:31.39]Alright, looks good.
[20:35.19]So now... You made Ron Swanson?
[20:39.24]I... I think it's... No, this is not... That's not Ron Swanson.
[20:54.26]Ron Swanson.
[20:57.42]Are you talking about the guy that talks like this when he's very upset about something?
[21:02.42]He's pulling a prank on people in that office.
[21:05.08]Is that who you're talking about?
[21:06.50]I just want to make sure I know who I'm getting the right person.
[21:10.93]Is that it?
[21:11.81]I've only seen two episodes of that show.
[21:19.73]That's right.
[21:20.13]I did it right.
[21:20.53]Alright, let's go.
[21:28.99]Okay.
[21:31.01]Accept.
[21:34.03]Welcome to Traveler's Rest.
[21:34.89]The game is in early access, which means it's still being developed based on your feedback.
[21:37.61]If you're enjoying your time, please consider leaving a review.
[21:39.90]I move.
[21:41.90]The trigger is run.
[21:46.76]And that's decoration mode.
[21:53.34]So these are the ales.
[22:00.67]Is this like... Is this what I have on draft?
[22:02.13]Yeah, I'm definitely putting orange juice on draft.
[22:08.17]Would that... Could you do that?
[22:12.94]Could you imagine fucking orange juice like on draft?
[22:15.40]It'd be so cool.
[22:17.32]Just like... Would it work?
[22:21.14]Why is that weird?
[22:22.26]Okay, let's go...
[22:27.88]Decoration mode, you can place items.
[22:29.41]Select an object, move the cursor over it.
[22:32.29]Get closer and press A. Okay.
[22:38.51]Ooh.
[22:43.06]Maybe in the corner?
[22:44.26]Just initially?
[22:55.14]Yeah, I don't like it over here.
[23:02.01]There we go.
[23:04.79]Wait, the benches are facing the wrong way?
[23:06.11]Wait, wouldn't this be wrong?
[23:12.97]Yeah, okay, there we go.
[23:17.21]Customers will also expect their table to be well lit in the evenings.
[23:20.19]Try placing the candle on the table.
[23:26.07]Candles are consumed over the course of days, so you'll need to replace them in the future.
[23:29.13]Okay.
[23:32.13]Isn't the right spot?
[23:40.64]Style.
[23:42.10]Ooh.
[23:43.90]Is it on the table?
[23:44.72]There we go.
[23:49.90]Get close to the book on the bar and press A to open your stock.
[23:53.02]Okay, so this is book on the bar.
[23:56.34]How much money do I have?
[24:03.25]You're going to burn this place down?
[24:04.48]Why is there only one table here?
[24:08.32]Because I just opened.
[24:18.39]I got here.
[24:18.69]This looks cute.
[24:19.09]It doesn't look cute.
[24:23.13]Alright.
[24:23.35]Storing food here will add it to your bar stock.
[24:25.07]While your bar isn't stocked, you will serve gruel.
[24:27.37]Uh-oh.
[24:30.61]Gruul only rewards a small amount of money.
[24:32.95]Should I just serve Gruul to people?
[24:37.22]Okay, so storing food here.
[24:38.32]I need to store food.
[24:40.72]Trends?
[24:42.14]Oh, you can see what people like.
[24:43.32]That's cool.
[24:45.92]Press down to open your tavern and serve some Gruul.
[24:51.24]You have a quest.
[24:51.98]I don't want to serve Gruul.
[24:53.40]Okay, first customers.
[25:02.93]So serve six customers.
[25:05.69]Alright.
[25:10.44]Come on in.
[25:11.66]We have gruel.
[25:14.18]That's all we have.
[25:15.02]You want some gruel?
[25:19.08]Customer has requested an item.
[25:21.76]So serve them with A. They must have had a problem with the decoration mode being left on.
[25:27.35]Alright, here you go.
[25:32.63]That's all they get to have?
[25:34.17]They can't even have any beer?
[25:46.34]You want more?
[25:48.28]You want more gruel?
[25:49.30]Alright, that means it must be pretty good.
[25:50.68]Okay.
[25:55.31]Okay.
[25:57.64]Close up the tavern so you can place your new items.
[26:00.80]Call last orders by pressing down.
[26:02.99]This will prevent new customers from entering the tavern.
[26:05.73]Okay, we're closing.
[26:09.83]Pressing that again will force your tavern to close, but you will lose reputation.
[26:14.49]You should wait for your customers to leave.
[26:22.64]So if I hit that button again, I force everybody out.
[26:31.69]What even is gruel?
[26:36.15]To me, gruel is just kind of a catch-all for slop food.
[26:42.17]What is it?
[26:42.83]Is it like... Is it like gluten?
[26:47.07]Is it like grains?
[26:48.41]Is it like oatmeal?
[26:49.23]When I think of gruel, I think of oatmeal.
[26:54.65]It's grains and water.
[26:58.04]Flour boiled in water.
[27:00.56]What?
[27:01.42]Hold on, let me look it up.
[27:02.48]What actually is it?
[27:04.61]Gruul.
[27:10.07]A thin liquid food of oatmeal or other meal boiled in milk or water.
[27:16.99]Some type of cereal such as ground oats, wheat, rye, or rice heated or boiled in water or milk.
[27:22.90]Thinner than porridge.
[27:27.30]That doesn't even- Okay, that doesn't sound bad.
[27:30.65]In my brain, gruel was disgusting.
[27:35.09]Like, it was like, I don't know, all kinds of weird fucking parts.
[27:38.51]Weird, just gross shit in it.
[27:39.55]I thought it was like, I don't know.
[27:40.67]I thought it was just gross.
[27:43.96]That actually does not sound that bad.
[27:45.14]It sounds like oatmeal.
[27:46.02]That sounds fine.
[27:51.58]That is gross.
[27:53.06]No, it's not.
[27:54.28]Oatmeal's not gross.
[27:56.14]Okay, set up a table using your new items.
[27:57.60]Enter decoration mode.
[27:59.66]Alright, so I need a new table.
[28:00.68]Okay.
[28:06.92]It's like the item on your... Oh, there it is.
[28:08.76]Here it is.
[28:09.10]Table.
[28:11.88]This is a little table.
[28:12.68]Alright, this is like a couple's table, right?
[28:16.24]Or like one person here and one person... Oh, the other side.
[28:24.45]This is for like dinner.
[28:31.71]Oh, it has to be over here.
[28:34.55]Why?
[28:34.71]Did it not fit?
[28:41.50]I only have one stool there?
[28:47.74]What?
[28:54.67]Hold on.
[28:54.97]I guess the table's against the wall.
[29:02.54]Yes, it is.
[29:03.00]Okay.
[29:10.27]Okay.
[29:11.23]Open your tavern, serve new customers, complete more quests.
[29:13.81]Get more gruel.
[29:14.77]I think it looks good so far.
[29:21.82]Alright, let's go.
[29:23.70]We're open.
[29:31.08]If you go on a first date and bring them to the gruel restaurant.
[29:35.33]What if it's the best gruel in town?
[29:42.43]One of your customers has dirtied the floor.
[29:47.79]Tavern vision will highlight important objects such as dirty tables, floor dirt, and important customers.
[29:54.27]Clean the floor by selecting the mop and then pressing X. What the hell?
[30:04.18]How long does it take?
[30:07.42]Don't do that.
[30:11.30]You want gruel?
[30:12.04]Who wants some gruel?
[30:17.25]Alright, go on.
[30:17.67]There's not enough room for all these people.
[30:18.87]What did I just get?
[30:20.77]You can now serve porridge and grog.
[30:26.21]Alright, I can put grog in there.
[30:33.62]Grog.
[30:34.20]What is grog?
[30:37.24]Why do I feel like grog is gruel with vodka poured on it?
[30:42.20]Okay, you now serve porridge.
[30:51.45]Grog.
[30:52.81]Okay.
[30:54.23]And there's porridge.
[30:56.33]So I just own it.
[30:58.37]That's why I knew the beer tap and had the keg of grog.
[31:03.67]Wait, I can have... I can have soup on tap?
[31:16.30]Table's dirty.
[31:27.50]Can I really... Can I put whatever I want on tap?
[31:34.64]What a lovely, clean tavern.
[31:36.06]Thank you.
[31:36.40]Can I make it?
[31:41.00]Alright.
[31:42.64]What if I make one?
[31:50.82]How do I drink this?
[31:53.08]A customer has requested a beer.
[31:55.13]Move next to the beer tap and press and hold A to pull a beer, then get close to the customer.
[31:59.09]Oh, I have one right now.
[32:01.58]Is this what you want?
[32:03.23]There you go.
[32:03.95]Ooh, one silver.
[32:09.79]I love that sound.
[32:16.43]Gruul?
[32:26.82]You should go back to only serving Gruul.
[32:29.50]Nobody wants that.
[32:41.44]Imagine you're doing this from Metabucks in the Metaverse.
[32:47.00]Yeah.
[32:50.67]From Metabucks in the Metaverse.
[32:52.75]I love Metabucks, that term.
[32:59.63]Remember you're bad at this?
[33:00.63]What are you talking about?
[33:04.82]I've only served everybody.
[33:06.28]I've served everybody very quickly.
[33:08.52]Very... Hold on.
[33:15.85]I got an axe?
[33:16.91]Can we get this table wiped down?
[33:18.09]Hold on.
[33:20.15]Close your tavern and go outside to chop trees.
[33:25.27]Let me take care of that real quick.
[33:26.99]Sorry, this place is fucking disgusting.
[33:32.86]Well, maybe if you didn't miss your mouth.
[33:36.26]Look, people are just dumping shit everywhere.
[33:41.50]Is this disgusting?
[33:42.32]It is not.
[33:52.30]Oh, I gotta close this place.
[33:53.30]Alright, we're closed.
[33:54.02]Better not rain tomorrow.
[34:07.55]Can they watch your stream in the bar?
[34:09.15]Thank you.
[34:13.47]Thank you.
[34:14.71]Thank you.
[34:15.33]Thank you.
[34:15.63]Thank you.
[34:15.93]Thank you.
[34:16.19]Thank you.
[34:16.55]Thank you.
[34:16.91]Thank you.
[34:23.51]Alright, nice.
[34:25.23]We're closed, right?
[34:25.97]And add carrots to the gruel.
[34:59.37]Here you can order items for your tavern.
[35:01.92]Simply select an item to add it to your basket.
[35:05.32]Or press UI select gamepad to add five.
[35:11.26]Three hours.
[35:11.76]Okay, so we can buy this stuff.
[35:13.92]Ooh, ale yeast.
[35:14.75]Should I get some of this?
[35:17.89]Alright, I'm gonna get one of those.
[35:19.11]I'm gonna get one of these.
[35:21.51]I'm gonna get two barleys.
[35:23.61]I'm gonna get two barley seeds.
[35:25.53]I'm gonna get a bed.
[35:26.19]I don't have enough money.
[35:28.30]Alright.
[35:29.10]Um, okay.
[35:29.34]Buy that.
[35:33.27]Oh shit.
[35:33.57]This is expensive.
[35:36.03]57.
[35:36.19]What's oh, the bed.
[35:37.31]17.
[35:40.39]Alright.
[35:40.91]Buy that.
[35:47.68]What is all this?
[35:48.18]Okay.
[35:49.46]Hire staff.
[35:50.10]I can't do that yet.
[35:51.84]Orders.
[35:52.44]I don't, I can't do that yet.
[35:53.56]Calendar.
[35:57.24]Alright, so there's important events.
[35:58.89]That's kind of cool.
[36:01.67]I don't see any events here.
[36:02.71]Alright, so I think we're good for a little while.
[36:08.97]So it didn't want me to cut down trees.
[36:10.11]How do I attack?
[36:14.34]Does this count?
[36:22.54]Happy Gruul Saturday.
[36:28.13]Where do I go to do this?
[36:33.52]Oh, okay.
[36:33.80]There we go.
[36:36.58]Can I replace these?
[36:46.07]How much wood should I get?
[36:46.83]Just put wood in the gruel.
[37:00.06]That'd be such an unbelievably awful filler.
[37:02.30]Okay, one more tree.
[37:19.23]Historically accurate filler.
[37:23.39]What?
[37:26.64]That's not true, right?
[37:29.00]Okay, you've turned your first work area, the sawmill.
[37:33.28]Build it outside the tavern using the decoration mode.
[37:35.86]Like the copper sickle.
[37:37.82]I gotta clear the weeds.
[37:42.68]Sawmill.
[37:44.24]Alright.
[37:46.07]I gotta clear this shit.
[37:54.45]Star Gruul Valley.
[37:55.93]I mean it plays pretty nice so far.
[38:01.68]I mean I really like games like Stardew.
[38:11.83]I should probably plant some trees though.
[38:29.33]Alright, which, sawmills would probably be, if this is my tavern, I don't want the sawmill to be that close.
[38:35.65]So maybe back here?
[38:36.43]Like, to the right.
[38:40.06]Alright, sawmills are going on the right.
[38:41.14]I'm gonna go right here.
[38:48.55]Okay.
[38:50.87]Okay.
[38:53.62]Oh, I thought that was way bigger than I thought.
[38:55.82]That's okay.
[38:56.76]I thought this was a big building.
[38:58.04]Like a big lumber mill.
[38:59.96]This is a table.
[39:03.82]Okay, so it's just a table.
[39:05.14]So I'll put it over here.
[39:05.74]I think this is fine, right?
[39:10.69]I don't want to go that far to get this.
[39:12.75]I think right here is fine.
[39:16.75]Wait, hold
[39:28.87]I like the sound of the grass.
[39:31.47]It does have a good sound, doesn't it?
[39:32.91]Alright, let's put it right here.
[39:35.93]I think that's a good spot.
[39:39.35]Okay.
[39:44.32]Now... Each crafter has a list of recipes.
[39:51.30]These show the required ingredients, fuel, and time.
[39:53.57]Click the recipe name to begin crafting.
[39:56.91]Wooden planks?
[40:00.43]Okay, make how much of these should I make?
[40:02.66]It's very crunchy, smooth and crunchy.
[40:06.30]Each recipe takes time to craft.
[40:07.70]Once the timer is full, move closer and press A to collect it.
[40:12.84]It takes 10 minutes.
[40:18.00]Like actual 10 minutes or in-game world 10 minutes?
[40:24.22]Okay, it's just in-game world.
[40:35.31]Okay.
[40:35.53]What do we do with the planks?
[40:44.70]Nice.
[40:45.26]Family Guy mobile game.
[40:53.91]Hey, whatever.
[40:54.51]Need to make one more.
[40:58.43]Planks.
[41:04.61]Your character is very stylish.
[41:06.67]Character is very stylish.
[41:07.89]Thank you.
[41:09.33]Thank you.
[41:09.85]Appreciate it.
[41:12.57]Who are you?
[41:12.87]Can I talk to people in town?
[41:18.21]Alright, so now I have pickaxe.
[41:20.90]Okay.
[41:25.48]Okay.
[41:27.06]They keep telling me the decoration mode needs to be turned off.
[41:29.94]I bet you in the playtesting of this game, people probably were walking around, whoever being like, why can't I play?
[41:36.95]What's happening?
[41:40.35]So they, that's a good reminder to turn it off.
[41:46.07]That would have been you.
[41:46.99]Yes, it would have been.
[41:49.05]Absolutely would have been me.
[41:51.15]How do I, I, I can't get rid of the stone.
[42:05.98]Does this grow back?
[42:15.11]Can you pass out?
[42:17.17]I wonder.
[42:23.03]Dude, it's not a rock tree.
[42:25.45]Yeah, but it's still here.
[42:26.81]The smelter and the anvil.
[42:31.30]Ooh, okay.
[42:34.04]When you build the smelter, a new working area dedicated to metals will be created.
[42:38.02]This cannot overlap any other working area.
[42:40.18]Good to know.
[42:46.54]Well, if the... Okay, if the lumber mill is going to be right there, then the smelter needs to be right next to it.
[42:56.27]I can't get rid of this.
[43:03.77]Right above it.
[43:05.77]I'll do right above it.
[43:06.37]It's going to be ugly, but I don't care.
[43:10.75]Can I actually hold on?
[43:14.17]I can't clear it.
[43:14.75]Let's put it above.
[43:18.25]It's fine.
[43:23.99]Game's kind of like Battlefield 20.
[43:25.17]Alright, let's put it down.
[43:32.61]I'm thinking just ride over it.
[43:34.35]We can make this look nicer later.
[43:37.54]Now what?
[43:41.52]Open.
[43:42.02]Fuel.
[43:43.96]Fuel.
[43:44.88]Alright, so here's this.
[43:46.96]How much did I do?
[43:49.81]Iron bar.
[43:50.45]Not enough fuel.
[43:53.97]I need 10 fuel.
[44:00.17]Why so much fuel?
[44:03.49]That's way too much fuel.
[44:04.33]Alright, iron.
[44:09.27]Okay, I can only make two iron bars.
[44:20.33]Where the heck up?
[44:25.69]Oh, that.
[44:26.23]Okay.
[44:27.15]I can do that.
[44:28.13]Put all these logs in it.
[44:31.17]Iron sheet?
[44:31.67]Alright, copper.
[44:34.75]Smooth and slim.
[44:36.17]I'm gonna make this.
[44:36.65]I don't even know what it does.
[44:37.31]I know people will say, like, I'm seeing a lot of the D face and... But I think this is... I used to not say any bad words.
[44:52.00]But... Guys, that's just how I talk.
[44:55.33]Alright?
[44:55.65]I'm sorry that a lot of people aren't used to that.
[44:58.05]This is how I talk.
[44:59.15]And that's how it's gonna be.
[45:05.73]That you might see, you know, me being like, what the heck?
[45:08.29]It's just, that's how I talk.
[45:20.12]It just doesn't feel right when you curse.
[45:29.37]That, that has so many layers on it.
[45:32.45]That comment has so many layers.
[45:33.97]It's just like, God damn.
[45:35.82]It doesn't feel right.
[45:40.18]Uh, I'm going to make a couple of sticks.
[45:49.25]I have an anvil too.
[45:52.49]Ooh, nice.
[45:57.80]Iron nails?
[45:59.28]Hinges?
[46:01.18]Candelabra?
[46:02.92]Candle holder?
[46:06.44]Can I make some nails?
[46:07.72]Carpentry?
[46:08.32]Is this carpentry?
[46:17.84]Would you restream Stardew?
[46:20.62]Yeah, probably.
[46:21.36]In a format like this where we're just kind of hanging out.
[46:27.76]Sickle somebody walking by.
[46:29.42]Oh, we know why you're here.
[46:33.77]I can't.
[46:36.49]Alright, I need... Let me... How late is it?
[46:48.19]What time is it?
[46:49.05]It's kind of late.
[46:49.72]I'm going to bed.
[46:50.34]I got some deliveries, didn't I?
[46:54.76]Oh, shit, I did.
[46:57.74]Cool, alright.
[46:59.38]How do I go to bed?
[47:10.91]What?
[47:15.21]I can't put firewood in here?
[47:20.68]Cellar?
[47:22.66]Why do I have a cellar?
[47:26.14]There's a crafting room?
[47:27.18]There's a cellar?
[47:27.92]Okay, here's my personal little inventory.
[47:32.40]Alright, fine.
[47:32.90]I'm going to bed.
[47:35.70]This is your bedroom.
[47:36.50]Sleep in your bed to save the game.
[47:37.74]If you stay up too late, you'll pass out.
[47:39.47]How late is too late?
[47:40.19]Is this a horror game?
[47:53.34]Is 5 p.m.
[47:54.04]too late to take a nap?
[47:55.02]No, it's not ever too late to take a nap.
[47:59.18]Naps should always be considered whenever you think you need it.
[48:03.09]Right?
[48:04.51]So if it's 6 or 7 o'clock, maybe there's something you know you really need to do.
[48:09.55]Or you really want to get done.
[48:11.73]I don't think it's ever too late.
[48:12.81]I think after... When it is pitch black outside, I think that's no longer a nap.
[48:18.59]I think that's you going to bed.
[48:22.20]But I think that doesn't happen till about, for me, 7 to 8 p.m., I think.
[48:28.50]At least.
[48:28.84]Okay.
[48:36.38]Don't lose progress.
[48:39.88]Okay, I did it.
[48:40.91]What about winter?
[48:45.77]I mean, you really should be trying to awake during the day and sleep during the night.
[48:52.50]It's best to get your body on that schedule if you can, but guess what?
[48:55.86]A lot of people don't have working schedules that do that.
[49:01.97]Some people start their day, start their job at, some people at 6, 7, 8 o'clock at night.
[49:10.99]The number one thing that you need to be aware of.
[49:13.51]Try to get at least, you know, you really want that six to eight.
[49:17.43]You want six to seven to eight hours.
[49:18.95]You want those, you want eight hours.
[49:20.15]You really want to try to get it.
[49:21.77]Hard.
[49:23.44]But you really want it.
[49:28.32]Okay, before opening your tavern, consider stocking up for the day.
[49:31.90]You'll need more logs for crafting and the fireplace.
[49:33.76]Visit the post box to order.
[49:36.26]Okay.
[49:37.18]Consider stocking up.
[49:42.01]Why do I have so many of these?
[49:45.24]Why do I have this many?
[49:46.22]Alright, I'm not gonna open this place yet.
[49:49.34]We're putting candles around.
[49:50.20]I'm gonna get another table, probably, right?
[49:56.00]Another table's a good idea.
[50:02.78]Do I have enough to make another table?
[50:10.95]Oh, there's a tech tree.
[50:13.29]How do I make a table?
[50:15.67]We're not open.
[50:22.41]Oops.
[50:25.47]I screwed it up.
[50:27.87]I'm in decoration mode.
[50:29.41]I didn't listen.
[50:30.05]Alright, blacksmith table, brewing, coal, firewood.
[50:41.84]How do I make a table?
[50:50.82]The rocks are here.
[50:54.60]They are here.
[50:55.26]Oh wow.
[51:06.91]I imagine you can probably permanently get rid of these somehow.
[51:13.43]Hey, can you please boot up Fallout 76?
[51:14.99]I need another member for my expedition.
[51:22.27]Well, I can assure you it's not going to be me.
[51:28.21]Let me just make sure I can assure you of that.
[51:38.06]Okay.
[51:38.98]This thing really wants me to still use the smelter for some reason.
[51:44.06]You obtain the smelter and maybe I have to make something on the anvil.
[51:53.19]Didn't I have?
[51:53.79]I do.
[52:01.61]So let me make nails.
[52:02.73]Nails?
[52:14.03]Why the fuck not?
[52:14.93]You actually hate Fallout 76.
[52:16.77]Unsubscribed.
[52:17.39]I need fuel in this... Alright.
[52:29.82]Should I make a... Okay, I'm gonna make nails.
[52:32.58]I'm gonna have five nails.
[52:34.30]How long does this take?
[52:36.98]A long ass time!
[52:43.16]Why are you dying on this hill?
[52:45.40]Playing Fallout 76?
[52:46.16]What do you mean?
[52:54.22]I don't want to play it.
[52:55.99]I don't want to play Fallout 76.
[52:56.87]Isn't that just a personal preference of game that I like?
[53:08.45]Do it.
[53:08.87]Play it.
[53:09.27]Why not?
[53:12.32]I never was a big Fallout fan.
[53:15.00]Not really.
[53:18.29]There are two franchises that I have close to zero experience with.
[53:23.83]One of them is Fallout, and the other one is Assassin's Creed.
[53:29.95]Those are two franchises that I have very close to zero experience with, the entire franchise.
[53:45.32]Fix that.
[53:45.84]Play it.
[53:49.46]I did play New Vegas.
[53:52.92]I played Fallout 3 a tiny bit.
[53:54.72]I played Fallout 4 a little.
[53:56.92]But not... We're talking all those experiences.
[54:00.91]Even Fallout New Vegas.
[54:03.43]We played it for a couple of days.
[54:05.65]And then I just started spawning easy peats.
[54:10.11]And it was over.
[54:11.65]That was it.
[54:17.79]Alright, I got a lot of room over here.
[54:19.37]This so badly wants me to keep you.
[54:20.61]Why is the tutorial for the smelter still there?
[54:23.06]Okay, maybe I have to make some more stuff.
[54:31.78]But anyways, alright.
[54:32.64]How much stock do I have?
[54:38.16]Can you spawn EZP now?
[54:39.42]Um, no, dude.
[54:43.62]Sorry.
[54:51.17]I wanna make, um... Firewood stockpile.
[54:56.70]No.
[54:58.16]Plank stockpile?
[54:59.08]What should I make?
[55:01.32]Coal stockpile?
[55:02.22]I'm just gonna serve gruel, fuck it.
[55:05.12]I'm sorry.
[55:05.54]Um... Let's go for it.
[55:15.33]I have plenty of beer.
[55:16.11]I have plenty of this stew.
[55:19.17]Porridge or whatever.
[55:22.69]Can I put porridge on tap?
[55:25.31]No, unfortunately.
[55:27.67]Oh, I gotta plant these trees before I keep going.
[55:44.44]It only needs a certain area.
[55:52.11]That looks good.
[55:52.61]Okay.
[55:54.79]Alright.
[55:57.09]So those will grow.
[56:05.49]Looks pretty good.
[56:06.16]What about quests?
[56:08.58]Quests.
[56:11.02]Quests.
[56:12.64]That's a weird word to say.
[56:13.86]I want everyone to just say quests out loud.
[56:23.07]Quests.
[56:26.79]It's kind of weird, isn't it?
[56:27.79]A lot of long S. Quests.
[56:36.20]Stop saying it so much.
[56:37.28]No, but like, quests.
[56:42.68]Alright, it's time to open.
[56:47.30]Did I just... Oops.
[56:48.40]Alright, we're open.

[58:52.59]Stop cleaning the table when they're eating at it.
[58:54.07]It's weird.
[58:56.25]Would you rather be... Alright.
[58:57.87]Would you rather go to a restaurant and have the table be disgusting and have someone come over and clean it or would you rather it just not get addressed at all?
[59:08.22]Hey!
[59:08.38]Hey!
[59:13.53]I feel like I would want it to be addressed.
[59:32.94]Uh oh, somebody's getting rowdy.

[62:29.91]Why are you closing your bar at 4pm?
[62:34.63]Because I need to... I'm not ready.
[62:37.03]I'm not ready.
[62:37.95]I have like a tech tree now.
[62:46.46]This is how you learn new recipes.
[62:48.18]Each tech costs skill points, which is earned from crafting.
[62:52.04]Physical, nature, and mental.
[62:57.09]Oh, God.
[62:57.55]Alright, so... Mild ale.
[63:02.99]Porter.
[63:04.13]Pale.
[63:05.21]Lager.
[63:06.45]Mead.
[63:10.09]Mead.
[63:12.79]Oh, I need... Okay.
[63:14.88]I have one point with the red crystal.
[63:17.66]I need two blue and two green.
[63:19.74]We'll go in mead.
[63:20.74]We'll do it in the mead tree.
[63:21.50]Porridge to soup.
[63:27.41]Roasting.
[63:28.85]Sausages.
[63:32.37]I kind of feel like I want to do sausages and mead.
[63:35.55]I think that's the tree I want to go down.
[63:46.64]Let's just make wine.
[63:47.58]And cider eventually too.
[63:54.24]Yeah, definitely the bottom part of the tree.
[64:00.73]No soup on tap?
[64:04.79]I don't even know.
[64:05.75]You can't do that.
[64:07.33]Soup?
[64:08.11]Stew.
[64:08.86]Oh, I do like a good stew though.
[64:11.72]A nice hearty stew.
[64:15.84]Hmm.
[64:19.01]Well, we have to... We're here anyways, so we're either going this way or that way.
[64:21.51]Alright, sir.
[64:25.95]Five balls of porridge.
[64:27.17]Craft ten iron nails.
[64:30.69]Alright.
[64:30.89]I think I can probably do that soon.
[64:40.14]I need iron.
[64:40.94]I need fuel.
[64:41.72]I need one more.
[64:44.66]Okay, I need... I need fuel.
[64:52.37]15 fuel.
[64:52.81]My goodness.
[64:58.60]Small batch draft micro stew.
[65:10.04]I need more materials.
[65:14.40]We're going.
[65:14.81]This is a material day.
[65:21.43]Materials only.
[65:26.49]Do I have an energy meter or no?
[65:27.87]I think it's just time.
[65:38.51]Looks like it's just time.
[65:39.35]Is there a town?
[65:44.21]I think there is.
[65:45.67]At least it looks like it.
[65:47.01]Yeah, I think there is.
[66:00.73]Meter at the bottom right.
[66:03.17]I think that's experience.
[66:10.02]Yeah, that's- that's EXP, I think.
[66:11.32]Collect the water.
[66:14.10]I need a bucket.
[66:16.49]Shit, how do I get a bucket?
[66:23.92]Town, town, town, town.
[66:26.48]Don't waste time on the grass.
[66:29.10]One of my favorite parts of Stardew Valley was just cutting the grass.
[66:33.04]So, I really hate to tell you that that's one of my favorite parts about this game.
[66:43.36]Walking around and clearing a new area was part of the fun for me.
[67:10.55]Lawnmower Larry.
[67:21.63]happens to you when you hit a certain age let me tell you let me be very very honest with you you I think you hit a certain age and then you just go like yeah like I don't know something about cutting grass that sounds kind of awesome that's not that's a interesting day I don't know why I don't know why
[67:54.73]I used to hate the notion of, no, I don't know, cut the grass.
[67:59.56]I don't want to cut the grass.
[68:01.86]And now I'm just sitting there thinking like, ugh, cutting grass.
[68:06.70]Ugh, planting.
[68:08.85]I'm going to plant some fucking tomatoes.
[68:21.70]Oh, you know what I think I'll do this year?
[68:24.64]Green bell peppers.
[68:27.74]Like, to me, that's excitement.
[68:28.84]I... I'm gonna fucking scare... Okay, this is... I'm looking... I can't say that, because it's not true, but I think it's funny to say anyway, so I'm just gonna say it.
[68:47.03]I'm looking forward to this season's tomatoes that I'm gonna plant than the Elden Ring DLC.
[68:56.23]Is that fucked up?
[68:57.31]Is that, like, bad?
[68:58.19]Like, I'm looking forward to the sunflower harvest more than, like, the next Call of Duty.
[69:09.87]Is that, like, weird?
[69:10.97]I don't know.
[69:11.37]That seems, like, kind of funny to say that.
[69:16.71]But this is, I mean, that's arguably just completely not true.
[69:24.64]Okay, I need... I did the quest, right?
[69:29.52]Craft a small table using the workbench.
[69:31.58]Ooh!
[69:34.28]Where?
[69:34.50]I need a new table.
[69:42.97]That's the workbench, right?
[69:47.51]Have I not on... Oh, wait a minute.
[69:48.57]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[69:49.67]Something has appeared in my inventory.
[70:00.92]Oh, I don't like it there.
[70:03.74]Better.
[70:03.96]I don't like this.
[70:05.12]I need to move this.
[70:09.94]I hate it.
[70:15.38]Oh, I hate it.
[70:15.94]Give me this too much space on the right.
[70:22.47]I hate it.
[70:28.15]Wooden jug?
[70:30.87]What is this for?
[70:31.93]Small bench.
[70:32.69]Alright, individual ta- Okay, I need a- I want another small table.
[70:37.55]For lonely people, an individual table.
[70:41.84]30 cents.
[70:46.04]I think I want to save to get the bigger one, right?
[70:49.58]Two more nails?
[70:52.17]What's the quest for?
[70:53.95]It is a small table.
[70:54.75]Alright, so I need two more nails.
[71:05.85]Damn it.
[71:07.75]Oh, I can make it.
[71:08.35]Okay, we're good.
[71:16.18]Do a gardening stream.
[71:20.80]I mean, that's kind of a nice idea, maybe.
[71:22.52]Let me ask you guys.
[71:26.52]Genuinely speaking, and be honest, and I don't want people to be dishonest.
[71:31.51]If I were to, let's just say, for the sake of argument...
[71:37.90]Have a portion, like, so let's say like once a week.
[71:43.32]We check on the garden.
[71:47.26]And we just kind of plant stuff.
[71:51.80]Is that something that you guys would actually think was kind of interesting to do?
[71:55.05]Just to kind of relax and be like, hey, look, this is kind of how it looks.
[71:58.85]Hey, here are the bell peppers.
[71:59.95]Here are the sunflowers.
[72:00.65]Here's how they're doing.
[72:01.49]That'd be fun.
[72:10.22]Agricultural stream.
[72:13.92]And these streams would not be long.
[72:15.35]They would be just check-in on the garden streams.
[72:26.41]Oh, shit.
[72:27.13]Wait, the bar is open!
[72:31.20]It's been open?
[72:31.74]Oh, no, thank God.
[72:32.48]I was like, the bar is still open.
[72:39.60]What is this?
[72:43.54]Unironically, that would be something I would look forward to.
[72:45.86]Huh.
[72:51.08]Maybe I'll think about doing it.
[73:04.20]You don't make your bed?
[73:07.85]No.
[73:08.93]Um... I mean, I've always had this theory that I only make my bed if I know that there's gonna be company over it.
[73:13.91]That I'm gonna want a tour of your place.
[73:23.11]Oh, let- Oh!
[73:23.79]Let me give you the tour.
[73:25.21]So here- Yeah, let- Hey!
[73:26.75]This is where- This is where I'm living.
[73:28.23]Yeah, okay.
[73:29.07]Come on.
[73:29.41]Oh, there's the bed.
[73:30.09]Ah, there it is.
[73:31.71]It's the- It's the- You're giving a tour to somebody that has not been over yet.
[73:36.89]And then just peeking in for a second.
[73:38.31]Oh, wow, wow, interesting.
[73:39.69]Okay, so that's where you sleep.
[73:41.39]Wow!
[73:42.04]That's pretty much it.
[73:44.68]Alright, I need to make my table.
[73:52.72]I have a cat?
[73:59.85]Where did I get a cat?
[74:10.97]Okay, how about... I like that.
[74:14.23]I like that.
[74:23.44]I like... I like this one.
[74:37.19]A cat has wandered into your tavern.
[74:38.76]I guess it lives here now.
[74:40.72]Buy a bed and a water bowl to keep it happy.
[74:44.56]Oh, well, we have to do that.
[74:45.62]We have to make sure this is going to be fine.
[74:46.96]Alright, how do I do that?
[74:51.19]I haven't even left my fucking house.
[74:54.45]I need to go see what's in the town.
[74:55.97]Do you know what I mean?
[74:59.76]I'm sitting here.
[75:00.22]I haven't bought anything.
[75:01.42]I've...
[75:08.89]You can buy it in the mailbox.
[75:18.20]That's true.
[75:37.52]Where is it?
[75:39.28]Alright, order.
[75:41.69]Every five days, five random ingredients will be available to order, marked with a star.
[75:46.41]Some ingredients can be farmed after unlocking them in the farming tech tree.
[75:52.39]Butter?
[75:54.55]Potatoes?
[75:55.05]You can probably make your own booze.
[75:58.36]That's kind of interesting.
[75:59.32]Alright, I need, first of all, I need a thing for the cat.
[76:02.00]Cat bowl.
[76:03.44]20 silver for this.
[76:04.82]20? 20?
[76:09.10]That's all my money.
[76:09.81]What about cat food?
[76:22.16]Can I serve cat food to people?
[76:28.66]I know the answer is definitely no, but it's worth it.
[76:33.69]It's worth a question.
[76:39.52]cat bed cat bed 25 that's all I don't I can't even afford it well at the very minimum let's at least get the bowl the water okay I need to make my table
[77:06.95]Open the damn tavern and make some money.
[77:09.27]Yeah, I'm trying to make money because I'm trying to make a second.
[77:11.75]I need a second table.
[77:12.55]That means more customers can be served.
[77:15.08]That means more money.
[77:15.68]That means more ingredients.
[77:27.56]Alright.
[77:29.16]I think I have enough to do.
[77:34.44]I need five more of these.
[77:37.64]And that'll be it.
[77:38.70]And I can make the table.
[77:44.25]That means better pizza.
[77:45.95]I might be able to make better pizza.
[77:53.77]What about benches too?
[77:56.08]Oh, that's right.
[77:56.94]Good call.
[77:58.06]That's true.
[77:58.42]It's going to take an hour and ten minutes.
[78:04.48]I'm not opening until I have it.
[78:08.94]Yeah, what about a stool?
[78:14.14]I can't even make a stool.
[78:15.08]Oh.
[78:16.44]Oh.
[78:20.50]Wooden planks and iron nails.
[78:21.96]Alright, I need some more iron.
[78:23.50]Alright, I can do that.
[78:24.57]Okay, now I just need more wooden planks.
[78:40.98]Good.
[78:49.69]I'm not opening the store yet.
[78:50.53]No.
[78:52.63]If you were reincarnated as an animal with all of your memories, what animal would you want to be?
[79:05.50]There's a couple of really interesting answers to that question.
[79:13.40]I would... I mean... Is tortoise a weird answer?
[79:17.92]Because they live to be like a hundred.
[79:30.54]You don't want to say any kind of insect.
[79:34.08]Because most insects live very, very short lives.
[79:37.31]It's like, oh yeah, I'm going to be... I would love to reincarnate as a spider.
[79:41.87]Like, with all your memories and you just... That's not long enough.
[79:50.12]What's an animal that lives a long time?
[79:53.88]Tortoises live a long time.
[79:54.98]Don't elephants live a long time?
[79:59.21]Parrots live a long time.
[80:00.21]Yep, some birds live a long time.
[80:02.51]That's right.
[80:08.74]One of those.
[80:15.82]Maybe a bird.
[80:16.64]Some type of bird.
[80:17.18]One of those birds that can... You know, I want to be intelligent too.
[80:22.98]Okay, I can unlock the crafting room.
[80:32.02]Hold on.
[80:34.96]We make... Alright.
[80:37.33]So, to make a bench, I need these.
[80:40.23]I need fuel to do that.
[80:46.17]I'm running out.
[80:46.61]I need more wood.
[80:51.89]Candle holder?
[80:55.37]I'll make one of these too.
[80:56.01]Why not?
[81:01.08]What is this thing?
[81:11.29]The oldest tortoise is thought to be over 430 years old.
[81:14.72]Oh my god.
[81:21.82]What is this?
[81:25.18]What if this is?
[81:25.58]This is new.
[81:26.03]It's to make firewood.
[81:31.71]Ooh, now we can actually have the... Yeah, that's gonna be better.
[81:39.77]My birthday on Monday, say happy birthday to me.
[81:43.13]Happy birthday!
[81:50.26]I feel- I don't know if I'd want to be a turtle though, a tortoise.
[81:52.52]I feel like I- I just need to move so fast.
[81:57.38]Like I'm all- I feel like moving really slow would drive me crazy.
[82:00.56]It would definitely be a bird.
[82:05.22]Birds can just make noises and shit.
[82:07.34]And it's completely fine, it's totally normal and unexpected.
[82:11.53]Birds just going like... It's like, oh no, look, that's normal, that's a bird.
[82:18.16]Like, of course that bird's doing that.
[82:20.38]Right?
[82:20.52]I could just do that whenever I felt like it.
[82:28.95]Yeah, nobody's gonna be mad that I did that.
[82:31.93]Like a bunch of you just got mad right now, for instance.
[82:36.10]You know what I'm saying?
[82:36.60]For instance, some of you just got very angry with me.
[82:39.20]If I was a bird, you would be like, that's normal.
[82:41.85]That's a normal bird behavior.
[82:43.41]So I don't care.
[82:43.95]Should I buy these?
[82:52.86]No.
[82:53.14]Alright, so what do I need to make this?
[82:54.22]Okay, I have... I need two more batches of nails and then that.
[82:58.58]I need more fucking fuel.
[83:09.32]More batches of nails.
[83:12.29]And then you need to make those wooden sticks.
[83:16.69]20 of them.
[83:17.15]Okay.
[83:26.09]Well, being a human certainly has its perks.
[83:28.27]Wait, what is this?
[83:28.81]This is long.
[83:29.29]Being a human has its perks.
[83:33.18]The majestic albatross offers several advantages that make it a compelling alternative.
[83:37.58]For starters, albatross are incredible flyers, capable of traveling thousands of miles in a single journey.
[83:42.77]Their long lifespans of up to 60 years also make them ideal for those seeking longevity.
[83:47.49]In addition, albatrosses are known to mate for life, forming strong bonds and that endure... Where did you get this?
[83:54.81]What is this?
[83:56.85]Well, being human certainly has its perks.
[83:58.51]The alternative of being an albatross.
[84:01.39]Where did you get that?
[84:14.73]It's alternative?
[84:15.97]Oh, look what I can do.
[84:20.09]Small table.
[84:21.65]And then I need two more batches of nails and two more batches of wooden planks.
[84:28.52]You go through fuel so much.
[84:29.72]It's crazy.
[84:32.00]I guess I can start using the coal.
[84:33.06]I need more iron.
[84:35.28]Alright, coal is worth a lot.
[84:41.39]I'm gonna do a hundred.
[84:48.24]Okay, we're good.
[84:52.09]Professor Oak- That was a Professor Oak-ass answer.
[84:55.21]It's like 2pm and I haven't opened the bar yet.
[85:04.33]Well, whatever.

[85:53.97]The quest that I have is to have a small table and then have a bench next to it.
[86:01.68]What about the cat?
[86:17.98]Cat's fine.
[86:18.44]See?
[86:23.74]I'm gonna redecorate this place.
[86:25.06]This place sucks.
[86:26.28]Is this a coaster?
[86:36.14]I'm a square coaster guy myself.
[86:38.32]I feel like it's a little more surface area for drips.
[86:57.88]Okay, that's good.
[86:58.75]Have you ever played Graveyard Keeper?
[87:05.77]I have not.
[87:11.00]Alright, I'm not going to light the fire.
[87:15.78]Crafting room.

[87:19.08]$10 and $11.
[87:19.78]What?
[87:19.90]What?
[87:25.55]No.
[87:26.63]That's too much.
[87:29.53]This is my house.
[87:30.75]Why can't I just walk in?
[87:31.73]Okay.
[87:33.62]I'll get it right now.
[87:35.10]Table's gonna be done.
[87:35.72]Okay.
[87:47.45]Make the bench.
[87:49.87]Small bench.
[87:50.89]We're good.
[87:57.97]In the meantime, I'm going to do this stuff.
[88:01.19]I said respond.
[88:04.52]You know, I'm just going to walk over here.
[88:07.22]I can't.
[88:07.54]Oh, there we go.
[88:27.71]Should we do a charade stream?
[88:31.17]No talking and chat has to guess what I'm doing.
[88:41.02]That's not a bad idea.
[88:41.96]That's kind of funny.
[88:49.82]This needs to grow back.
[88:59.21]Emote only for the streamer.
[89:03.11]Speaking of Breath of the Wild, you guys played charades with me during Breath of the Wild.
[89:06.41]Let me just make sure... Alright, this... There is a town.
[89:28.07]Alright, I'll probably get a map eventually.
[89:29.71]Oh, look at all this.
[89:32.87]Should I break this?
[89:33.83]I'm going to smash this stuff.
[89:35.17]Can I?
[89:40.08]It's a dock.
[89:40.88]Okay.
[89:43.64]It does seem to be an outside world.
[89:45.28]Okay.
[90:01.28]Why the Doritos?
[90:02.40]They're referencing when I couldn't figure out the Lost Woods.
[90:07.10]Whatever the hell it was.
[90:08.82]In Breath of the Wild.
[90:10.65]About 45 minutes to an hour walking in a circle and people screamed at me.
[90:15.21]It was very embarrassing.
[90:20.39]And I have not played the game since.
[90:21.59]That's not true.
[90:32.41]Alright.
[90:33.87]It's time to not open.
[90:40.12]Here we go.
[90:41.38]Now make another bench.
[90:44.96]Shit.
[90:45.64]Okay.
[90:46.04]Make another bench?
[90:48.32]I can do it.
[90:48.90]I can do it.
[90:49.18]I can do it.
[90:52.59]I just need nails.
[90:53.73]Yep.
[90:54.01]Okay.
[90:54.55]Fuel.
[90:54.65]Fuel.
[91:02.13]I'm going to make a ton of nails.
[91:04.17]I might as well.
[91:06.50]And then do I have the wood for this?
[91:09.04]Wooden planks.
[91:19.94]Time is it?
[91:20.24]Getting late.
[91:33.67]What's going on up here?
[91:36.43]Five and Rochelle wanted to detonate the ice block to gain access to the mine.
[91:41.35]How can they dare to suggest such a thing?
[91:45.01]I understand that Brock is furious about detonating the ice, but what else can we do?
[91:52.82]Chief Petra is going to kill me when she finds out.
[91:54.86]Oh, hold on.
[92:04.02]What time is bedtime?
[92:04.76]There's horse riding and fist full of frags.
[92:12.76]We'll definitely go back to that one of these days.
[92:14.71]I imagine, for sure.
[92:18.55]Alright, I gotta go.
[92:27.65]Is pass out time midnight in this game?
[92:30.05]Or is it 1, 2, 3 o'clock in the morning?
[92:32.12]I wonder.
[92:35.61]Oh, remind me to get a bucket.
[92:36.59]No, wait.
[92:50.81]Come on, hurry up.
[92:56.71]I'm going to do two benches.
[92:57.65]I feel like I need it.
[92:59.11]And then I'm going to wake up in the morning and be ready.
[93:06.45]I do have the cat bowl.
[93:07.27]Let me put it down.
[93:11.79]What?
[93:12.21]No, cat bowl's in here.
[93:17.53]Okay, here you go.
[93:32.51]About right.
[93:33.83]I want you away from customers.
[93:35.53]You know what I mean?
[93:36.23]No, I want you right here.
[93:38.19]That's good.
[93:40.39]I need water.
[93:46.07]This is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be.
[93:48.10]Where does this go?
[93:48.64]I need to put candles in here.
[93:59.16]I'm going to sneeze now.
[93:59.78]I apologize in advance.
[94:07.63]Ooh.
[94:09.53]Nice.
[94:10.85]Okay, what else?
[94:16.59]I have that table now.
[94:17.77]I got two small tables.
[94:25.94]This place is going to be flooded with people now.
[94:30.00]Um... I think that's alright.
[94:34.55]Alright.
[94:39.26]I need more benches.
[94:45.51]Have this one.
[94:52.97]Way more people are going to show up.
[94:57.23]Okay, that's good enough.
[95:13.60]Or at least want them to sit at... At least have one at each table, right?
[95:16.88]That makes the most sense.
[95:22.10]Alright.
[95:23.52]We are closed.
[95:24.30]Good night.
[95:28.60]Getting up in the morning.
[95:29.38]First thing I'm doing... Is opening.
[95:37.93]Can you explain how this game is any different than Doom Eternal?
[95:40.95]Yeah, sure.
[95:48.13]is not in this game.
[95:50.20]It is in the other one.
[95:50.84]I think that's a pretty major difference.
[96:11.17]OK, I'm we're working today.
[96:14.45]I'm opening the store.
[96:24.20]We're open.
[96:25.63]Oh shit, hold on.
[96:26.55]I was supposed to close it immediately.
[96:32.95]I gotta sort through all this bullshit in my inventory.
[96:35.95]Oh, I can't place it when it's open.
[96:37.51]Alright, well, whatever.
[96:38.11]I'm just gonna... I'm ready.
[96:39.31]Is there enough beer?
[96:42.39]We always get gruel.
[96:43.05]It's fine.
[96:52.02]I need employees.
[96:53.02]This place is gonna... This place is gonna get trashed really soon.
[97:04.98]Okay.
[97:12.82]Oh, he's pissed.
[97:27.52]Why are you so pissed off?
[97:28.28]What?
[97:29.78]The customer has become a nuisance.
[97:32.56]They will annoy everyone around them.
[97:34.48]Hit them with your mop to kick them out of your tavern.
[97:39.50]Are you serious?
[97:43.95]That's so fucked up.
[97:45.55]Imagine somebody just getting beat with a mop?
[97:52.05]In the middle of your enjoyable gruel luncheon?
[98:02.93]Let me take care of that quickly for you.
[98:08.47]Yeah, this is a dirty mop, too.
[98:09.83]This is not a clean mop.
[98:13.50]You know what, too?
[98:15.68]This would not hurt as much as it would be a total... Imagine a wet mop.
[98:20.58]Like...
[98:25.93]All the little pieces of mop would just kind of mold around your face and around your head.
[98:32.32]It would be fucking awful.
[98:34.28]It would be terrible.
[98:42.41]And it would spray everywhere.
[98:44.27]Wouldn't it just water splash everywhere?
[98:47.11]It would be terrible.
[98:55.93]We're making money.
[99:05.54]I'm so glad that we're mostly... Alright, you just took that?
[99:08.82]You bought that gruel and threw it on the ground.
[99:12.59]You should definitely clean... You should clean that up.
[99:16.13]I just handed it to you.
[99:16.99]Uh-oh.
[99:19.09]Uh-oh.
[99:27.21]Plenty of gruel to go around.
[99:29.23]It's all we serve.
[99:39.64]Nobody wants any beer from the tavern.
[99:41.58]They just want... Oh, there we go.
[99:47.93]Why?
[99:48.65]Beer is what makes... I want more of that.
[99:50.91]Come on.
[100:05.11]It makes me happy.
[100:06.75]It's gonna give us a good review.
[100:16.50]Just leave out of the review when I hit that guy in the face with a wet mop.
[100:20.05]You don't need to write that part.
[100:37.82]Running back and forth.
[100:39.88]I must know how ye clean this place.
[100:44.56]I want to speak to the barkeep.
[100:46.16]Uh-oh.
[100:48.73]What's wrong?
[100:52.51]Wait, what's he doing?
[100:55.79]What was he supposed to do to that guy?
[100:56.85]He went behind that guy.
[100:58.37]He was menacingly going to hurt that guy.
[101:00.65]Why did he do that?
[101:06.14]He was trying to start a fight with that guy?
[101:07.80]Why?
[101:08.92]Why?
[101:10.53]I always wanted to see what happened.
[101:13.83]He went to a random party at the bar and just started, like, trouble?
[101:22.54]I want to speak to the bartender.
[101:24.60]Just kidding.
[101:25.06]I want to punch this old guy.
[101:35.37]Yeah, I'm not closing.
[101:38.94]We need to make at least 50.
[101:54.25]You beat a paying customer.
[101:56.07]Um, I'm sorry, but I don't care how much how much money you're spending in here.
[102:06.67]You're not gonna, you're not gonna fuck with the other patrons.
[102:08.95]Sorry, that's not how it works.
[102:14.73]You need to close and find your cat.
[102:22.79]Where's the cat?
[102:27.29]This place is bollocks.
[102:32.81]Okay, alright, I'm sorry, I'll be quiet.
[102:36.51]Hey, barkeep, this place sucks.
[102:39.79]Hey, come on.
[102:40.75]I'm sorry about that.
[102:41.99]You're right.
[102:42.47]I'm sorry.
[102:42.85]I probably should have been a little more courteous.
[102:57.86]Is there no beer left?
[102:59.87]Stop.
[103:11.82]Nobody's even order- Why are they all getting so- There's no alcohol being served.
[103:20.18]It's- They get- They're- Oh, yo, uh, this person drank, like, too much beer, and now they're, like, drunk and being rowdy.
[103:28.93]No, they're eating gruel only.
[103:34.85]They're not- Why- I had a little too much gruel, and now I'm fuckin' mad.
[103:42.85]It's fermented gruel?
[103:44.05]Is there no beer?
[103:48.60]Oh my goodness.
[103:50.02]That's what's going on.
[104:03.61]Where's the cat?
[104:04.51]I don't know.
[104:04.97]I don't know where the cat went.
[104:16.21]What time is it?
[104:17.53]What time is it?
[104:18.69]Is it 2, 3 o'clock in the morning?
[104:22.27]What day is it?
[104:23.07]I don't know what time it is.
[104:27.53]It's 2 p.m.
[104:28.57]Why do I feel like it's 2 a.m.?
[104:41.30]Upper left.
[104:42.62]Yeah, yeah.
[104:47.43]Alright, everybody get out of here.
[104:49.45]I gotta find my cat.
[104:53.63]Ooh, wait.
[104:56.63]Ooh, your tavern has become cold.
[104:58.77]It wasn't cold before.
[105:12.36]Way too hot in here.
[105:16.84]Wait, what?
[105:18.40]What do you mean it's way too hot in here?
[105:20.58]It just told me to do that.
[105:26.83]You're smoking everybody out.
[105:29.21]But... Why is it too hot?
[105:33.85]It just said it was too cold.
[105:40.03]Turn the fire off.
[105:42.79]No, I like it like this.
[105:48.04]Okay, 53 bucks.
[106:02.33]Unlock the crafting room.
[106:07.05]Your tavern is cold.
[106:08.31]This is your crafting room.
[106:09.61]Let's make some porridge.
[106:15.88]I have so much porridge already.
[106:20.10]Bucket with water.
[106:21.26]Okay.
[106:27.61]So I just need a bucket of water?
[106:30.91]That sounds awful.
[106:34.61]Extra ingredients?
[106:35.57]Some recipes have mandatory modifiers.
[106:37.25]Porridge requires grain.
[106:42.03]Barley porridge.
[106:49.96]I don't want seeds in it.
[106:51.83]I just put seeds in this.
[106:59.53]Where's the cat?
[107:00.35]I don't- the cat's right here!
[107:02.09]There it is.
[107:15.94]Cat's fine.
[107:18.34]Alright, porridge.
[107:19.22]Now let's brew some beer.
[107:20.38]Need a malting machine.
[107:24.40]Start crafting malted barley.
[107:26.51]Okay.
[107:36.33]So... Malted barley.
[107:40.12]So I need barley and water.
[107:42.08]And I need fuel in here.
[107:46.64]Malting takes a while.
[107:48.52]You can re-open your tavern and serve porridge while you wait.
[107:53.00]Have I not even had porridge an option?
[108:03.31]Porridge has not even been a food option.
[108:06.79]I was wondering why we're only serving gruel.
[108:19.65]I don't have any cat food.
[108:21.13]The cat's fine.
[108:21.69]The cat's got water.
[108:23.21]I need to get a cat bed eventually.
[108:25.53]Alright, I'm going to open this door again.
[108:32.07]This time I've got more options.
[108:35.91]Yeah, I've got plenty of porridge.
[108:36.99]I've got plenty of beer.
[108:39.28]Let's go.
[108:49.57]Porridge?
[108:51.21]Oh, I do have porridge.
[108:52.57]There we go.
[108:54.05]Finally.
[108:54.53]This is way, making way more money.
[109:12.14]I was going to say, why am I serving gruel?
[109:21.07]Five bowls of porridge.
[109:21.95]I got a rug.
[109:33.34]Shit.
[109:36.42]I'm already making way more money.
[109:45.03]What's wrong?
[109:47.51]I'm down.
[109:55.16]Alright, I'm just making for... Can I put them on the bar?
[109:58.18]No.
[110:02.85]They don't go bad, right?
[110:09.59]Do they go bad?
[110:10.13]They do go bad.
[110:20.41]Okay, so I can't just pre-pour a dozen of them.
[110:35.73]You can pre-pour, nothing will expire.
[110:37.40]It actually kind of seems like that.
[110:42.70]Alright, I don't want to do it all though.
[111:00.93]Somebody just said, I love spreading misinformation.
[111:09.16]Well, stop!
[111:10.56]Don't do that!
[111:11.14]Get out of here.
[111:19.23]It's too dark in here.
[111:20.89]It's dark in here.
[111:22.71]Is it really that dark?
[111:27.73]I guess there's one source of light.
[111:38.11]Alright, I'm going to close pretty soon here.
[111:45.52]Here.
[111:46.72]Here, here, here.
[111:47.38]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[111:48.52]I already got it.
[111:48.92]I'm doing it.
[111:49.60]Look.
[111:50.70]See?
[111:52.64]Better.
[111:58.73]It's cold in here.
[111:59.43]Everybody good?
[112:08.14]Everybody's good.
[112:08.56]46 bucks.
[112:36.74]How many more of these do I have?
[112:37.76]I got plenty, I got plenty.
[112:40.18]I almost had a beer.
[112:44.24]Alright, I'm officially out of alcohol.
[112:49.18]Alright, I gotta close.
[112:56.55]I'm done.
[113:02.82]Do I have to hit everybody?
[113:04.04]Or will they... Because when they stand up like that, it goes... It usually means somebody's about to get in a fight.
[113:09.18]Hey!
[113:10.45]Hey!
[113:10.53]What's with all the bad reviews?
[113:15.99]Bad reviews?
[113:16.93]For what?
[113:20.37]What did I do so bad?
[113:21.29]Hey.
[113:24.61]Be lucky we ain't selling gruel anymore.
[113:29.45]I got better reviews when people were eating slop.
[113:41.84]Bring the gruel back.
[113:43.14]It was way better.
[113:44.18]Yeah, I made a nice stew and people say, gross, this stew sucks.
[113:47.40]Bring the gruel back, bro.
[113:48.92]Okay.
[113:56.05]Create wort by boiling grains.
[113:58.37]Place the mash tun and create some mild wort.
[114:04.22]Check back later when it's finished.
[114:16.07]Oh my goodness.
[114:18.15]Uh.
[114:23.31]Cool.
[114:26.04]Why?
[114:26.54]Mild wort, malted barley, bitter hops and three buckets of water.
[114:43.70]Alright.
[114:45.54]I need more beer.
[114:46.54]I'm almost out of beer.
[115:01.03]You fell off plus ratio plus rule.
[115:05.15]What?
[115:05.31]Alright, what else I got?
[115:07.91]Another candle holder.
[115:15.31]What is this empty keg?
[115:17.27]Oh.
[115:19.43]I guess I can fill it.
[115:20.17]I don't know what to do with that really.
[115:32.96]OK.
[115:42.79]Alright, so I gotta make.
[115:43.85]How long does it take?
[115:47.11]Takes a pretty long time.
[115:48.09]Can make some more barley.
[115:54.38]I mean, I could make some more.
[115:55.58]Yeah, I'll make some more stew.
[115:57.34]Yeah, I'll just make everything.
[116:06.44]Alright, time for bed.
[116:08.79]Tomorrow's a resource day.
[116:09.79]Speaking of resources.
[116:24.62]I should keep that out.
[116:34.83]I guess I'm not stressing for space at the moment, so I'll be fine.
[116:37.33]Alright, bedtime.
[116:45.01]What do I think of the game so far?
[116:46.03]I think it's fun.
[116:49.69]It's pretty cozy.
[116:57.11]Let me restock this.
[116:57.99]Okay, yeah.
[117:04.64]So now I don't... What about trends?
[117:06.08]Oh, I can't do that yet.
[117:07.06]Remember when Jerma talked about one of his ingrown nose hairs coming out the other side?
[117:14.46]Yes.
[117:17.18]It's actually kind of cold.
[117:18.87]I'll keep it going.
[117:26.78]Yeah, for those of you that don't know, this happened twice.
[117:29.22]This is not something that happened once.
[117:34.15]This happened on two distinct occasions, years apart from each other.
[117:44.47]So yeah, it's gross or whatever.
[117:46.75]I'm just gonna talk about it real quick.
[117:49.88]So inside of one of my nostrils, on the inside, not the outside.
[117:56.76]One of my nose hairs, it just was painful inside of my nose.
[118:02.50]And I don't want to just skip this because I want to read this, but I'm going to go quick.
[118:06.52]So I had a really painful area inside my nose.
[118:09.78]And I was like, what is going on?
[118:11.44]It was like, ah, this hurts in here.
[118:13.52]And it was like, it's probably like an ingrown nose hair.
[118:15.50]Fuck, whatever.
[118:17.44]So a week goes by or so.
[118:21.34]And I started getting a painful bump on the outside on the front of my nose.
[118:29.86]And it was just, what is going on?
[118:32.92]This hurts so bad.
[118:35.27]Another little bit went by, and I'm telling you, this nose hair went through the other side of my face.
[118:47.09]It ingrown haired out the other side, through my whole nose.
[118:55.42]It was crazy.
[118:56.46]It was like, how is this even possible?
[119:01.22]How did you get it out?
[119:02.42]Eventually, it just came out.
[119:04.62]I could pull it out from the front.
[119:15.78]It was wild.
[119:22.65]That's very ingrown.
[119:23.87]Oh, yeah.
[119:24.25]That's so ingrown, it came out the other side.
[119:28.72]Alright.
[119:29.10]Oh, I skipped it.
[119:29.66]I skipped it.
[119:30.06]I skipped it.
[119:30.44]I skipped it.
[119:30.84]I skipped it.
[119:31.18]I didn't want to.
[119:32.50]Oh, no.
[119:32.68]It's in the corner.
[119:33.16]Okay.
[119:33.26]Okay.
[119:34.66]Fermentation tank.
[119:39.27]I need a better spot for this stuff.
[119:40.35]Alright.
[119:43.59]Let me put this down.
[119:44.31]Let me move this out of the way.
[119:46.31]Put this in the corner.
[119:48.97]I'll put this next to the bed for all I care.
[119:50.88]No.
[119:50.98]No.
[119:58.96]I need to put it in the order that it happens, right?
[120:00.72]Okay, for the last stage, fermentation.
[120:05.76]Place the fermentation tank and create some mild ale.
[120:09.68]You can add modifiers, such as fruit and hops, and give your beer a custom name.
[120:16.16]Ooh!
[120:18.94]Mild ale.
[120:22.06]Aroma hop- Wait!
[120:24.09]I'm gonna go get, like, berries or something.
[120:33.43]Add gruel to it.
[120:36.95]Yeah.
[120:39.79]Can I?
[120:45.44]I don't think... No, I can't.
[120:53.13]But this is aroma hops and bitter hops.
[120:58.67]That sounds kind of cool to me.
[121:07.13]Alright, this is a resource day.
[121:13.13]I need to collect resources and need to build some more stuff.
[121:30.33]Another day without feeding the cat or giving it a bed.
[121:36.65]Hold on.
[121:41.37]Hold on.
[121:41.99]I want butter.
[121:47.05]Butter, chili and gruel and um... Honey and chili and butter.
[122:07.53]Cat bed.
[122:09.11]$25.
[122:09.51]This is wiping out my bank account.
[122:20.80]I need staff.
[122:24.60]Okay, water.
[122:29.18]Okay.
[122:32.64]It takes a few hours for it to get here, so I can do other stuff.
[122:35.04]Right, it's a resource day.
[122:36.21]You guys are distracting me.
[122:38.07]It's a resource day.
[122:50.02]Ingrown nose hair Grotto Beasts expansion, when?
[123:05.15]Do you actually have to feed the cat?
[123:06.51]I don't think there's cat food.
[123:07.83]Is there?
[123:23.86]Feed the cat.
[123:25.14]Where do I get the cat food?
[123:54.01]I'll do it.
[123:54.57]Just wait.
[123:55.83]I need to get it.
[123:56.75]I need to find a place to get it.
[124:10.31]There's no mechanic to feed the cat.
[124:14.45]You guys, what are you on about?
[124:30.87]Remind me to do this every so often because I will forget.
[124:49.36]Deforestation to build parking lots.
[125:07.17]I'm replanting.
[125:11.53]Do it for parking lots.
[125:13.05]This is a. No.
[125:24.00]I just want to share a little wood and I'm going to cut it for awhile.
[125:26.74]That's why you do a resource deck.
[125:50.06]Hates polar bears.
[126:03.24]This tavern is really shitty.
[126:04.50]Converted into a TGI Friday's.
[126:19.53]Are those places good?
[126:21.26]I feel like it's been so long since I've even sat down at a place like that.
[126:29.16]No, people are saying no.
[126:34.43]But then, are people going?
[126:36.41]People have to still be going.
[126:39.37]The business still has to be doing okay.
[126:58.30]You know, I feel like a lot of those restaurants... They're so consistent with what they have and what's on the menu and how it tastes.
[127:15.70]I can remember distinctly what it tastes like to get a food item from a Chili's or a TGI Friday's.
[127:23.36]I know what it's like.
[127:24.44]I know exactly what it's like.
[127:26.28]And 10, 20, 30 fucking years later, it's going to be the exact same, isn't it?
[127:33.03]That's not really a bad thing.
[127:34.21]That's really not a bad thing.
[127:37.57]If you really think about that.
[127:38.93]Okay, I know exactly what it's going to be like in there.
[127:44.07]There's no variables.
[127:45.03]I know exactly what it is.
[127:46.33]Stop cutting the grass.
[127:52.66]I do what I want to do and you do what you want to do.
[128:08.55]There's nothing else available.
[128:09.53]It's fine in a pinch.
[128:12.70]Yeah, I think that it's fine to operate it that way.
[128:15.28]I feel like a lot of people go there for that reason.
[128:19.67]Aren't those restaurants really, really kid friendly too?
[128:24.91]That consistency carries over with young kids, right?
[128:32.14]Yeah, so it definitely has like a pretty good purpose.
[128:52.68]You have the palate of a 10-year-old.
[128:57.60]Man, I never told you I... Huh?
[129:01.35]I'm telling you, I haven't eaten here.
[129:02.65]I haven't eaten at TGI Fridays.
[129:10.97]I don't even have a memory of eating at one.
[129:17.44]It's been a very long time.
[129:23.53]I'm making chocolate chip cookies.
[129:25.07]That sounds awesome.
[129:30.25]I want to do more of that.
[129:31.55]I want to bake brownies and stuff.
[129:33.55]I feel like I want to connect more with the world.
[129:38.38]I want to bake fucking brownies.
[129:40.62]I want to bake cookies.
[129:44.38]That's a great idea.
[129:45.84]Like, you know what?
[129:46.48]I'm just gonna get the materials.
[129:47.92]I'm gonna get the milk, the flour, the eggs, chocolate sauce and powder, whatever.
[129:54.12]Let's do it.
[130:01.27]Need to connect more.
[130:01.91]Kind of the world.
[130:06.75]I want to get this to a clean, like, 100, and I'm done for, like, a month.
[130:29.18]Replant the trees?
[130:29.85]I will... Judy does that?
[130:39.61]Judy does do that.
[130:40.31]It's like... It's cool.
[130:55.11]I'm so paranoid, though, when it comes to anything.
[131:00.51]I'm the type of person that if a burger is, you know, make sure to cook it for, you know, two to four minutes aside.
[131:09.64]I will freak out and be like, it's not done.
[131:11.44]Is it done?
[131:12.66]How red is it in the middle?
[131:14.12]Get a meat thermometer.
[131:14.90]Is it 140 degrees?
[131:17.00]How many degrees is it in the middle?
[131:23.82]I will crack the egg sort of slightly incorrectly and just rage quit.
[131:30.26]The egg will break and a shell will get in and I'll just be like, I'm done.
[131:32.90]I'm done.
[131:33.28]I fucked it up.
[131:33.74]It's over.
[131:34.10]I fucked everything's messed up and I'm done.
[131:44.58]Drama queen.
[131:49.70]I would be such a bad contestant on like a cooking show.
[131:54.59]I would crumble if Gordon Ramsay came over to me and said anything.
[131:58.87]I would crumble.
[132:04.37]That's not how you crack an egg, you donkey.
[132:06.73]Gordon, I'm just going to leave.
[132:09.52]Gordon, this is a really fun experience.
[132:11.64]I've been here for five minutes.
[132:12.62]I'm going to leave.
[132:13.78]Thank you.
[132:14.30]Appreciate the opportunity to be on Kitchen Craziness, but I'm going to leave now.
[132:22.08]Are you going to leave?
[132:23.10]You can't just leave.
[132:24.62]He's leaving.
[132:25.42]And it would be like, while I walked out, I'd be like, get the fuck out of here as fast as I can.
[132:32.81]He's leaving.
[132:33.81]And everyone's just like laughing and making fun of me.
[132:35.45]And I'm just like walking.
[132:36.17]Just give me my fucking car and get me out of here.
[132:42.19]I would be out of there in a second.
[132:53.17]And then, like, the fart reverb version of that weird violin sound would play.
[132:57.56]And then as I'm leaving, I would be the idiot.
[133:05.44]I would, like, back into a pole.
[133:06.94]I would be like, I'd back up.
[133:08.36]Like, I'm getting out of here.
[133:09.22]I gotta leave.
[133:10.12]And I would slowly back up and hit a pole.
[133:12.34]And it's like, fucking goddammit.
[133:14.69]Now the camera's gonna come out here and it's gonna be like, what did he do?
[133:17.85]Oh, that idiot.
[133:18.69]He backed up into a pole.
[133:21.19]Oh, yeah, let's go talk to him.
[133:22.53]And I'd be looking out the window.
[133:23.51]Gordon, I'm just trying to get out of here, man.
[133:27.07]What are you doing?
[133:27.75]You backed into the pole.
[133:30.17]I'm so sorry, Gordon.
[133:31.15]I'm sorry I cracked the egg wrong.
[133:33.14]Please don't hit me.
[133:34.04]And please delete all this footage.
[133:35.16]And then they would edit it to make me look like a fucking maniac.
[133:54.25]Alright, I need more.
[133:54.75]At least I have fuel.
[133:58.37]Let's get this all to 100.
[133:59.01]Or at least high enough.
[134:06.45]You know, Gordon Ramsay's mostly playing a character.
[134:10.21]Yeah, I'm... Of course.
[134:26.44]Alright, everybody.
[134:29.05]We can all collectively relax.
[134:31.77]Everybody just chill.
[134:32.55]I have the cat bed.
[134:57.47]There we go.
[135:02.57]By the window?
[135:04.78]Yeah, I don't want... Yeah, I want it to be a nice, comfortable place.
[135:11.60]Alright, that's better.
[135:13.24]I got some more stuff, too.
[135:17.05]Um... I want it to be like a buttered chili pepper beer.
[135:27.71]Congratulations, you have brewed your first beer.
[135:31.33]Experiment with new ingredients to create your perfect brew and food.
[135:33.97]Okay.
[135:36.79]Time to farm.
[135:37.83]The first thing you'll have to do is clear the grass of an area of land with a shovel.
[135:44.94]Oh.
[135:45.12]Okay.
[135:47.36]Alright, what kind of beer?
[135:48.26]I need... Make some barley.
[136:04.18]So this is where I need to make it.
[136:05.50]Alright.
[136:06.76]I'm going to say over here, make a little section like this.
[136:16.58]Oh shit.
[136:17.18]Okay.
[136:17.44]Now plant.
[136:22.41]What am I planting?
[136:39.03]I need seeds.
[136:47.62]Barley seeds, rye seeds, wheat.
[136:49.62]I want corn.
[136:50.20]Yeah.
[136:52.16]Five.
[136:52.74]Let's do 10.
[136:53.12]20.
[136:53.42]I need 20 spots.
[136:54.34]Corn is overrated.
[137:12.57]Corn is one of the reasons why modern society developed into the way it did, isn't it?
[137:21.77]Isn't corn one of the most important pieces of agriculture ever?
[137:30.84]It is?
[137:31.06]Yeah, it is.
[137:31.82]Okay, now that the land is free of grass, it's time to till.
[137:35.00]Select the hoe and till the land where you are going to cultivate your plants.
[137:46.58]In America, yes, but not the rest of the world.
[137:49.81]It's still very important.
[137:54.49]The amount of things that are made with corn are unbelievable.
[137:58.48]Like, really?
[137:59.26]That's a lot of stuff.
[138:01.88]Really?
[138:02.20]Okay, now I gotta get my seeds.
[138:08.00]How many spots do I need?
[138:08.88]I need more than that.
[138:25.94]Tobacco as well?
[138:26.94]Yes.
[138:28.08]Tobacco as well.
[138:36.86]I was just going to get it for free.
[138:37.96]How many spots is this?
[138:55.71]Yeah, you would know about tobacco.
[139:04.74]Cigarette... The cigarette meme has kind of really... I... What?
[139:12.82]The cigarette meme... Isn't that... Why is that a thing now?
[139:16.91]What happened here?
[139:19.07]What's going on here?
[139:20.47]What's happening here?
[139:24.49]Hmm...
[139:27.27]because I've shown myself smoking fake cigarettes.
[139:36.30]What is with the cigarette?
[139:37.44]That's like a thing that has really gotten popular recently.
[139:41.22]You've seen it too, haven't you?
[139:43.40]I've noticed it.
[139:44.06]You've seen it too.
[139:49.69]He still doesn't get it.
[139:58.87]I'm gonna go this way.
[139:59.89]How many does... I gotta count this.
[140:21.28]Corn.
[140:23.88]Okay, so we've got...
[141:00.92]37 38 39 40 huh I wanted to be wait what's going on here did I do something wrong
[141:28.95]Wait.
[141:31.37]No, that's correct, right?
[141:37.78]Yeah, this is the shape I wanted.
[141:39.84]Alright.
[141:40.78]Now we just plant a shitload of these.
[141:47.20]Crops will grow over time in three stages.
[141:49.16]Once fully grown, harvest the crop with your sickle.
[142:03.22]Where's my delivery?
[142:15.34]I bet you can't name 10 prime numbers.
[142:16.82]Do you think I cannot name 10 prime numbers?
[142:24.04]I had to put my phone down because it's dead.
[142:26.16]And I was going to just kill some time while I looked it up.
[142:31.06]But you're right, I can't.
[142:33.98]It's late.
[142:34.46]Oh my god.
[142:37.56]I was gonna do the thing where I repeat the question and then slowly talk and distract you while I look the thing up and then I say the thing while talking immediately finishing a sentence or two.
[142:49.89]So it's like there's no way he looked it up.
[142:52.02]He's been talking to us.
[143:03.00]Already?
[143:03.40]Damn.
[143:03.96]Alright, hold on.
[143:04.45]I need... Where's my delivery?
[143:07.41]There it is.
[143:07.87]Alright, let's get this planned.
[143:15.73]Okay, I will tell you, I thought this game was way more limited than I thought.
[143:23.49]It's slowly kind of gripping in stuff to do.
[143:27.46]I need more of these.
[143:40.08]I need way more of those.
[143:41.02]How many do I need?
[143:41.64]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[143:47.83]I need 15 more of those.
[143:51.31]I want corn.
[143:55.75]I don't want anything else.
[144:06.06]Is this ready to harvest?
[144:07.28]Not yet.
[144:07.80]No, there's no corn on it.
[144:13.73]Alright.
[144:16.59]Let's go.
[144:17.88]I'm gonna make... So what do I actually want to do here?
[144:20.36]What do I need?
[144:20.94]I need more ale, which I have some up here.
[144:24.46]Alright, let's make a new thing here.
[144:30.34]I need water.
[144:32.69]How much water do I have?
[144:34.83]Alright, I need water.
[144:40.27]Should I get this game?
[144:41.15]That all depends if you like what you see.
[144:52.10]I think the game's fun.
[144:54.04]Scratching a couple of decent itches for me.
[144:57.65]But that's a decision that you need to make.
[144:59.75]I think it's pretty cool.
[145:02.65]But I'm not you.
[145:15.95]Cat's heart is increasing.
[145:23.08]I'm not ready to open.
[145:28.96]Are you actually that moisturized or is that a lie?
[145:36.20]That's gotta be the stupidest thing I've ever heard to lie about.
[145:43.99]I can't really think of very much that would be dumber to say than... Yeah, I moisturize my face, and I just don't.
[145:50.81]Why even bring it up?
[145:55.25]I can't think... Like, why would I even bring it up?
[145:57.37]That's such a strange thing to lie about.
[146:02.44]Yeah, I like to moisturize.
[146:04.88]I don't, though.
[146:05.66]But if I just don't, this just doesn't make any sense.
[146:08.08]Why even bring it up?
[146:09.00]I have points to spend.
[146:15.06]We're going to go the mead tree, right?
[146:21.30]Cabbage.
[146:24.75]Root.
[146:25.99]Apples and pears.
[146:29.61]Basic carpentry.
[146:32.65]Large bench, large table.
[146:36.02]Lighting.
[146:37.32]Oil lamp.
[146:41.74]I want to go, let's go mead.
[146:42.34]Mead.
[146:46.45]Wine is next.
[146:56.52]And what about food?
[146:59.18]Buy a wall calendar.
[147:00.44]Plant 10 seeds in heart.
[147:03.55]Okay, so I need to buy a wall calendar.
[147:07.77]I'm playing with the controller.
[147:10.70]If a controller is available, I will play with it.
[147:15.07]Playing games with the keyboard, I think the last couple of years, I want to say, hurts my hands.
[147:24.01]Not anything too extreme, but that WASD position, and I really noticed it last night, that WASD sometimes, and even the arrow keys, can kind of cramp up my fingers for some reason.
[147:38.85]so if analog is a lot resting my hand sort of in my lap with the analog is um it's a lot easier for me at this point okay well I needed to buy what was it a wall calendar ornamental armor
[148:07.76]sack probably gonna need a scarecrow could be arthritis it probably is I imagine it's something like that probably there we go 80 no thank you I'm not spending 80 on a wall calendar does it have any game mechanic
[148:36.78]80 for a... What does it do?
[148:38.12]Okay, it will.
[148:45.07]Does it do something?
[148:52.97]Probably RSI, not arthritis.
[148:55.09]Well, I don't want to speculate on what it is.
[148:57.70]Okay, what does it do?
[149:03.74]No lewd picks.
[149:05.92]What?
[149:07.00]This adds comfort.
[149:07.82]Okay.
[149:08.10]Well, that's... Yeah, okay.
[149:08.90]Alright, plant.
[149:33.96]Hey, it's full.
[149:40.50]Why did I make all that corn?
[149:43.83]Is it for a purpose?
[149:53.27]This does take a long time.
[149:57.55]Okay, I can make the mead.
[149:58.47]The mead needs- Oh, there is honey.
[150:01.95]Wine yeast and an empty keg.
[150:03.51]I have an empty keg.
[150:04.23]Let me get some wine yeast.
[150:08.13]I want mead.
[150:21.32]You sold out to big corn.
[150:30.65]Porridge?
[150:31.27]I got plenty of porridge.
[150:32.19]It's not worth it.
[150:32.81]Okay, I want the empty keg.
[150:42.93]So I have this.
[150:43.85]I have this mild ale.
[150:46.08]And... Oh, goodness.
[150:48.26]I'm sorry.
[150:50.76]But this one's gonna be where I put the mead.
[150:52.84]Mead is gonna be one.
[151:03.68]In the Man of Medan stream, you used a controller, but then in the next Dark Picture stream, you mocked Etalyx for using a controller and proudly used a keyboard instead because you were a proud PC gamer, which then caused you to miss an important QTE because your DPI settings were fucked up.
[151:28.63]That was so fucked up though.
[151:31.70]Needing to move my mouse like 10 times.
[151:34.56]That was really funny.
[151:47.39]I'm glad it was funny because it was incredibly embarrassing.
[151:53.67]Oh, I gotta plant these trees.
[152:00.24]Any more?
[152:08.06]Nope.
[152:17.65]Cool.
[152:20.17]Resource day or no?
[152:20.75]You know what's so funny?
[152:30.95]about what we just said and what we just talked about.
[152:36.16]Some of you guys know this channel's history more than I do.
[152:45.49]Isn't that interesting?
[152:49.71]Like, specifically for streams...
[152:54.94]I stream, and I say a bunch of stuff, and we fuck around, we make some jokes, maybe I'll chill, we'll just talk, we'll bring up stories, whatever we do, we just kind of hang out, whatever it is.
[153:04.70]That conversation is usually gone from my brain a week or two later.
[153:13.79]So people be- it's almost like this is an encyclopedia of things I've said that I don't even- I remember talking about it for sure, but I don't- it's not like up in the front of the brain.
[153:25.46]It's funny to look back and have it be like, oh yeah, I like using controllers.
[153:29.28]It's much, much better.
[153:30.63]Hey, um, three years ago, you said that controllers were stupid and people that used them were dumb.
[153:37.13]And it's like, oh, I did?
[153:38.47]I meant, I mean, I'm, uh, I didn't mean to, I guess.
[153:45.32]I'm sorry.
[153:52.47]You have talked about how corn is the basis of civilization at least a few times already, though.
[153:56.55]Alright, so I'm consistent on that.
[153:57.85]That's good.
[154:12.30]That's why you could be gaslit so easily?
[154:16.56]Where's my wine?
[154:17.50]I bought it.
[154:18.00]I had to wait three hours.
[154:25.86]Finally.
[154:26.28]I want to make mead.
[154:34.93]Didn't you say that corn grew on trees before?
[154:40.09]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[154:41.85]No!
[154:42.92]Stupid idiot.
[154:44.26]Can I cancel it and get it back?
[154:45.46]I wanted to add ingredients to that.
[154:47.08]I just put, like, basic-ass bullshit in that.
[154:54.81]Um, no, I never believed that corn grew on trees.
[154:58.47]I... I tell jokes.
[155:04.80]It says cancel.
[155:05.52]I know it does, but I just want to fucking... I don't think that corn grows on trees.
[155:13.89]Some people take the things that I say on the stream sometimes.
[155:18.14]And some people believe that I think that corn grows on trees.
[155:23.38]You know what I mean?
[155:24.74]No, I promise you I don't.
[155:31.85]You don't tell good jokes.
[155:33.79]I never said the quality of them.
[155:35.87]I said I do.
[155:36.41]That's for you to decide, not me.
[155:55.89]What do you actually believe about bananas?
[155:58.91]They are a nice snack.
[156:00.53]And slightly ripe bananas are, I think, better than... I'm a big fan of slightly ripe bananas.
[156:05.43]Bananas are a good snack.
[156:09.34]That's it.
[156:11.60]Oh, Pog!
[156:12.26]Oh my god!
[156:12.78]Yeah, he loves bananas!
[156:18.24]Do I have enough?
[156:21.22]I need this mead to hurry up.
[156:32.09]I'm just gonna go to bed.
[156:32.69]I'm just gonna wake up and it'll be done.
[156:43.02]Nice.
[156:43.24]Alright, I got mead.
[156:51.65]I've ruined everything, unfortunately, because... I need an empty keg.
[157:02.76]I guess I'm gonna buy honey and I'm gonna put the empty keg in here.
[157:05.50]Because I want to add chili peppers to it and all this stuff.
[157:18.53]I have that, so I need... I already have an empty keg.
[157:20.97]I need honey.
[157:30.33]I think I can open this door, though.
[157:37.88]Yeah, I, I, I, I, yeah.
[157:40.54]Let's open this door.
[157:42.04]I already have this one on tap.
[157:43.52]That was my, my mild, uh, brew.
[157:47.16]And we can put the mead in here.
[157:49.86]Several unique items in stock.
[157:51.02]The more unique items you have in stock, the more reputation and money you'll earn.
[157:53.74]This only counts the base item, ignoring any modifiers.
[157:57.29]Okay, well that's good.
[157:59.37]I got plenty of porridge.
[158:01.43]Make sure the tables are set in the right way.
[158:05.55]I could make another bench, but open.
[158:19.90]Does Holly ever remind you of stuff that you have said that you forgot?
[158:26.93]Yes.
[158:30.29]For instance, you guys are like this one.
[158:35.33]Oh shit, what is it?
[158:41.15]Um, my mother sent me a message the other day.
[158:50.15]Would you like to know what it said?
[158:53.65]It said, Basecam or Riot.
[158:58.53]That is my mother.
[159:05.00]And I was just like, uh, ma.
[159:15.81]Hold on.
[159:24.71]She's one of us.
[159:29.33]You gotta do it for ma.
[159:30.55]Do it for ma.
[159:33.61]Hey, I was on facecam yesterday.
[159:41.86]Alright, I'm making way more money.
[159:43.18]Alright, come on, hurry up!
[159:59.07]Give me a good rating.
[160:01.98]The best mead in this whole town.
[160:05.40]Thank you.
[160:13.11]Is it good?
[160:16.32]How's the stew?
[160:18.10]How's the smell in here?
[160:30.18]No keg, oh.
[160:32.40]Is it cold?
[160:44.11]The meat is popular.
[160:49.33]The meat is very popular.
[160:59.59]Wait till I add a little bit of spices in it.
[161:09.05]Yes, I'll wipe your table.
[161:09.83]Just wait.
[161:18.83]This shit is flying off the shelves.
[161:22.38]This one's pretty good.
[161:23.58]Oh, no one's bought a single mead.
[161:25.16]Never mind.
[161:25.86]Oops.
[161:27.26]Am I supposed to take my shoes off in here?
[161:30.20]What?
[161:46.96]One feels like a noble here.
[161:49.68]I'm the best.
[161:50.44]I wanna speak to the barkeep.
[161:51.62]What's wrong?
[161:52.80]I wanna- Nobody touched that corn outside, by the way.
[162:12.38]Uh, ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make.
[162:15.84]If anybody touches the corn outside, you're dead.
[162:32.82]All the corn is gone tomorrow, by the way.
[162:39.49]I wake up and it's all gone.
[162:46.85]What do you think, 100 silver would probably do it?
[162:53.37]How's the temperature?
[162:55.52]Too hot?
[162:56.04]I got it.
[162:56.38]Bro, it grows on trees.
[163:09.41]Chill.
[163:09.83]Aww.
[163:25.21]Where's the nearest cobbler?
[163:26.99]How's it going?
[163:56.54]Close it up?
[163:57.29]No.
[164:01.37]I'm not closing it until at least 100.
[164:02.41]I think I need more money.
[164:08.44]Should I make another couple of... stuff to do fermentation?
[164:26.05]It's only noon.
[164:27.33]I'll probably run out of product before then, though.
[164:38.04]How much is left?
[164:39.78]I'm just going to go to this.
[164:40.58]These are both.
[164:41.04]I'm going to go till I sell everything.
[164:42.14]I think that's a play.
[165:01.48]Do I have a favorite season?
[165:07.30]Not really.
[165:13.11]I like winter and I like summer.
[165:14.19]Fall in Vegas is really, really nice.
[165:19.75]It's not hot, but it's just kind of nice out.
[165:23.49]I'm kind of... If I were to take...
[165:26.86]I don't know.
[165:27.20]I'm not like a big spring person.
[165:31.70]I like it.
[165:32.10]I don't know why.
[165:34.33]I like the cold, crispy air of fall and winter.
[165:38.97]And I like the heat.
[165:41.15]And kind of outdoor, kind of hot stuff.
[165:44.53]I like the outdoor heat of summertime.
[166:04.52]I like spring.
[166:06.74]Spring is nice.
[166:13.62]Wouldn't a gardener love spring?
[166:20.18]Yeah, but I mean, sunflowers.
[166:24.05]When we grew the sunflowers, that was May, June, right?
[166:28.09]Wasn't it like May?
[166:28.81]That was like May, June, July to like August.
[166:31.51]That was summertime.
[166:45.94]I'm so glad I'm actually making money now.
[166:49.04]They grow in the spring too.
[166:53.82]All I remember is I just need a lot of sun.
[166:56.50]It is in the name, isn't it?
[167:00.45]Oh, this is popular.
[167:02.47]My special brew.
[167:03.07]Alright, this is empty, so I gotta sell out of the mead and then we'll close up.
[167:36.03]Sell out of everything.
[167:43.10]Winter has really beautiful moments, but it's overall dark and lonely.
[167:50.46]You know... So, the thing with winter... Something about getting up in the morning...
[167:58.74]Still really, really cold outside.
[168:02.06]Just having a hot cup of coffee just in your hands.
[168:05.45]It's super cold.
[168:07.15]Everything's really chilly, but you just, you got that hot coffee, just hot cup of coffee right there.
[168:13.90]It changes everything.
[168:32.05]I really, coffee to me, it's not even, I mean, maybe it is a little bit for the caffeine at this point, because obviously I've been taking in caffeine pretty much every single day for a long time.
[168:44.52]But it's almost, I just, I like, I just love that.
[168:47.62]Tea, you can do this with tea.
[168:51.06]Tea hits a little differently for me though.
[168:53.02]I would rather drink tea in the evening hours, not in the morning.
[168:56.86]Tea is an evening thing for me.
[169:01.84]nice hot just just black coffee and it just it just it's got that scent it's just there it's just hot steaming freezing outside it's cold absolutely rigid outside
[169:25.19]Sometimes, sometimes even just kind of go outside with the coffee.
[169:29.84]Just be one of those cheesy commercial motherfuckers that has the bathrobe on.
[169:34.14]You know what I mean?
[169:34.60]Just like wearing their like morning clothes.
[169:39.60]It's like, ah.
[169:47.77]And all those coffee commercials.
[169:49.17]What's wrong?
[170:02.07]Hallmark movie?
[170:02.97]Alright, I'm out of... Do I have any more porridge?
[170:14.08]Alright, we are out.
[170:15.46]I've got two more of each, and then I've got no more porridge.
[170:26.66]The smell of coffee to me is what I like the most about it.
[170:40.87]To me, smelling coffee and hearing like a coffee being brewed.
[170:45.17]It doesn't matter what kind of coffee, what kind of coffee machine you have or whatever.
[170:49.84]If you have like a coffee maker, it doesn't matter what kind.
[170:52.94]That like, here it comes.
[170:57.92]And it's, it's almost, it's like you opened up like the, where the treats are for the dog.
[171:01.44]It's like, what, what's that?
[171:04.78]Coffee.
[171:05.02]Somebody make, somebody making coffee.
[171:06.48]Somebody's making coffee here.
[171:08.04]I want one.
[171:11.85]I love coffee.
[171:21.65]It's too dark in here.
[171:22.43]What happened to my candles?
[171:26.06]Alright, somebody buy the last two beers.
[171:31.46]The last four beers so I can close.
[171:39.58]That coffee maker sound...
[171:44.33]You all know the one.
[171:45.73]Like that drip coffee that... It's one of those things that just... It's one of the little things in life.
[171:58.04]It's just... Yeah, that's great.
[172:01.78]Whatever is going on right now.
[172:04.46]You fucking weirdo, go outside?
[172:06.08]I...
[172:12.44]You're acting like I just drink coffee and sit in the... I don't just drink coffee and... What?
[172:18.34]I'm talking about a morning routine.
[172:20.00]I don't just make coffee and like... Ooh, yeah.
[172:24.47]Hey, what's that?
[172:25.15]Is that coffee being rude?
[172:28.15]Like every 25 minutes?
[172:31.97]I'm talking about starting the day.
[172:34.13]I'm talking about you make coffee and then you start your day and you do whatever you're going to do.
[172:43.60]No, the thing I say we're talking about right now is not the only thing I do all day.
[172:49.90]Oh, you know what?
[172:50.64]Man, I love corn.
[172:51.88]Corn's so great, isn't it?
[172:54.73]All he does is eat corn.
[172:55.69]It's the only thing he does.
[172:56.85]He has corn just growing all over his house.
[173:00.41]What's wrong with him?
[173:00.99]Why does he just only eat corn?
[173:04.89]He has corn.
[173:05.78]There's corn.
[173:06.68]He has corn.
[173:07.84]He literally is sitting on furniture made out of corn.
[173:18.53]I just like corn.
[173:19.51]We're talking about coffee.
[173:21.15]We're talking about coffee.
[173:26.38]Somebody buy this.
[173:27.06]I don't want four beers just sitting here.
[173:43.75]Character upgrades.
[173:46.37]What's that?
[173:53.15]Uh, hold on.
[174:01.78]I don't have any candles left.
[174:02.68]I have to make some new ones, I think.
[174:14.26]Uh, I... Everybody get out.
[174:21.98]I don't... I think they have to order it if it's still on the tap.
[174:33.60]Make sure to give us a good rating.
[174:42.68]Plus one, is that even really a good rating?
[174:52.79]Plus of one.
[174:53.45]Alright, let me turn this off.
[175:21.33]That was a good day.
[175:21.87]I have almost two gold.
[175:34.99]Cool.
[175:35.11]What about the Jerma corn gif?
[175:43.18]That's right.
[175:43.66]There's a corn gif.
[175:51.77]Uh, I need to sort this.
[176:03.41]How do I get this off the screen?
[176:08.51]Whoa.
[176:17.74]Alright, I need candles.
[176:24.35]Make mead again, and this time... Ooh, here we go.
[176:27.19]Plant ten seeds and harvest crops.
[176:37.62]I got something for that.
[176:38.42]Mine shall mine, and none of it's for you!
[176:54.79]What is this?
[176:56.86]A grinder.
[176:58.08]Grind cereals and other ingredients.
[177:02.22]Yeah.
[177:14.65]Where can I put this?
[177:19.62]In the house?
[177:27.96]Can I make the house bigger?
[177:41.86]Okay, wheat flour, barley flour, rye flour.
[177:46.09]Where's corn flour?
[178:09.32]I don't want to buy that many candles and I have to be able to make them, right?
[178:27.21]You can't make beer from corn.
[178:29.45]You can make other alcohols though.
[178:35.63]Isn't moonshine corn?
[178:38.06]The corn mash?
[178:44.59]Can be, yeah.
[178:56.83]Moonshine isn't beer.
[178:58.19]You can probably make it in the game, though.
[178:59.67]And it's a game about making alcohol.
[179:04.33]Alright, material dump time.
[179:08.63]I want... Alright, we're gonna make a ton of... Okay, hold on.
[179:16.75]Gonna make a bunch of copper bars.
[179:17.85]Good idea.
[179:23.62]Bunch of screws.
[179:30.50]Maybe a bunch of... Maybe some hinges.
[179:36.59]And... Birdhouse.
[179:41.63]Make a birdhouse?
[179:44.97]Make a birdhouse?
[179:45.73]This is kind of expensive.
[179:54.62]It's actually really expensive.
[180:01.14]We talked about the bird watching stream, right?
[180:04.70]And I'm just going to give some stuff away.
[180:06.01]This stream's probably never going to happen, but maybe if it does, you'll be able to remember this.
[180:11.85]I wonder if the bird watching stream would... It's like, look, we're going to go on a bird watch.
[180:18.11]And then... I don't know, get a Bigfoot sighting on camera.
[180:25.01]And the rest of the stream turns into, like, there's Bigfoot.
[180:28.76]And he's, like, fucking hunting us.
[180:32.96]Don't tell anybody.
[180:33.92]Don't tell anybody.
[180:34.74]I think that's a fun idea.
[180:54.02]This dream's not gonna happen though.
[180:57.98]It's fun to talk about things that could have been or may have been.
[181:02.06]It's time.
[181:15.17]It's time.
[181:22.42]Here we go.
[181:23.90]Barley.
[181:24.85]Going in.
[181:28.03]That.
[181:28.69]Going in.
[181:30.87]Mead.
[181:32.03]Going in.
[181:33.89]But first, I'm going to make sure I have chili pepper.
[181:39.00]Butter.
[181:39.28]Okay, chili pepper and butter in the mead.
[181:45.86]Let's see if anybody pukes.
[181:54.67]I can't.
[181:55.31]Huh?
[182:05.46]I don't think I can do it.
[182:07.46]I can put honey in the mild ale.
[182:12.76]Maybe that's a good idea.
[182:15.33]What else can I do?
[182:18.75]Serve cups of melted butter.
[182:20.49]Ugh.
[182:27.67]Aroma hops.
[182:29.29]I should probably get some aroma.
[182:32.89]Bitter.
[182:35.53]Aroma.
[182:37.43]Dual hops.
[182:40.15]Just mix it all together.
[182:42.03]Who cares, right?
[182:42.71]Just mix everything.
[182:47.60]We're gonna have wicked bitter ale.
[182:57.17]I'll buy candles, too, because people complained.
[183:03.75]They're annoyingly... Where are they?
[183:14.04]Cobweb?
[183:19.02]Where are the candles?
[183:22.28]There we go.
[183:24.38]Five?
[183:24.66]Okay.
[183:31.90]I think alcohol is your next big merch idea.
[183:33.98]No.
[183:49.77]What are the quests right now?
[183:53.67]Calendar.
[183:54.19]It's the only thing I have.
[184:08.72]I want a large table.
[184:12.02]Hmm.
[184:12.26]I need another bench.
[184:24.44]Another bench.
[184:26.84]And then I want to make this really, really good.
[184:40.25]Do you have water?
[184:43.53]Yeah.
[184:48.37]Okay, now I'm going to go to bed.
[184:49.13]I might reload the game so people don't think it's always 3 a.m.
[185:01.46]I don't like the title screen.
[185:18.48]Hello.
[185:32.33]Barley flower.
[185:33.17]I can probably level up or something.
[185:34.77]Alright, let me go get my delivery and make some beer.
[185:52.02]Alright, let's craft up some beer.
[185:54.14]Go to bed again.
[185:54.91]Okay, mead.
[186:03.33]I want dual hops, aroma hops, and bitter hops.
[186:09.60]I want this thing to be just all over the place.
[186:24.49]I want people to take a sip out of this and go... Bananas... Barley seeds... Rye... Should I do rye?
[186:55.24]Hold on.
[186:55.60]What's in the tree here?
[186:57.70]This is white wine juice, white wine, white grape, must, red wine juice, red wine.
[187:04.40]I need one more blue.
[187:10.64]Okay, so this is wheat.
[187:12.02]Wheat, rye, and cider.
[187:15.62]Let me be able to make wheat beer.
[187:17.36]I'm going to buy a bunch of wheat.
[187:21.89]And plant it.
[187:27.24]What was it, 40?
[187:27.90]This stuff is cheap.
[187:42.21]Shrimp and white wine.
[187:52.62]I just remember, isn't there a scene where, like, Tim and Eric are in the hospital or something, and the doctor comes in, and he's like, I just want to say, we're really, really getting concerned about your white wine levels, we want to bring those up to make sure they match the shrimp levels.
[188:09.07]That was so funny.
[188:12.21]Yeah, we're getting really concerned here.
[188:13.95]Because don't they like eat too much shrimp or something?
[188:16.03]And then it's like, oh, wait, sorry.
[188:17.59]We want to make sure we get you, but we got to get your white wine levels up.
[188:19.98]They're kind of talking as if it's like plasma or something or like white blood or red blood count.
[188:30.82]Tim and Eric really did set the stage for that kind of humor.
[188:35.78]I think they really kind of set the bar on a lot of that stuff in a way.
[188:46.48]Alright, I want my stuff.
[188:51.76]Deliver it!
[188:52.78]I want a plant.
[188:53.34]I'm just gonna sleep.
[189:02.87]I'm gonna go sleep, wake up, and be ready to start the day.
[189:12.68]I could go collect resources, but nah, I'm going to bed.
[189:27.91]22 hour nap.
[189:35.91]Stuff like Steve Brule too.
[189:38.31]Just kind of... That's funny.
[189:45.12]I have not kept up with any of those people or shows or anything really at all.
[189:49.14]I just remember like 10, 15 years ago it was
[189:54.75]Kind of like they were really, especially like 15 years ago.
[190:10.97]Alright.
[190:12.47]Let's begin the process.
[190:13.97]I want my deliveries.
[190:27.19]This inventory is disgusting.
[190:28.64]I hate it.
[190:30.28]I need to clean this up.
[190:31.08]It's just it's so messy.
[190:32.10]I need to get I need to get my act together here.
[190:53.37]There's no watering, right?
[190:54.59]I feel like this could be a problem.
[191:08.20]Here we go.
[191:12.36]Alright.
[191:18.70]How do I get the cat to like me more?
[191:19.96]I need water.
[191:34.82]butter there we go alright let's fill the tap uh this one is gonna have which one I have two different brews don't I no I didn't start making it yet one's fine it's the one I wanted to buy anyways I think it's alright
[192:16.41]Bend your XP and upgrades for your character.
[192:18.01]Cleaning speed increase.
[192:22.05]Better bargaining, better price.
[192:23.54]Yeah, that for sure.
[192:30.26]Everything, yeah, better price.
[192:39.84]Better price and faster cleaning.
[192:47.01]Speed.
[192:50.35]Cool.
[192:52.42]Don't forget about the bench.
[192:53.58]That's true.
[192:54.70]I'll try not to.
[193:00.70]Feed the cat.
[193:01.40]Feed the cat.
[193:01.98]Feed the cat.
[193:05.02]I swear I don't think you can.
[193:12.97]Planks.
[193:14.83]There's the bench.
[193:17.48]Alright, now I'm gonna make a birdhouse.
[193:19.86]So, I'm gonna wait for these planks to get done, and I'm gonna just build the birdhouse, because why not?
[193:22.76]There's a bird in here.
[193:45.12]I've seen that make the rounds again.
[193:46.60]Oh, there's a bird in here thing.
[193:53.67]I've seen that.
[193:54.81]People have been sharing it recently.
[193:56.29]That gif of you eating the bird is the first time I ever saw you.
[194:06.20]Well, um... Thanks for hanging out.
[194:16.94]This is expensive, but I'm going to build it.
[194:20.28]Do we get to have bird friends?
[194:26.01]Do I still have that birdhouse?
[194:29.67]Maybe.
[194:31.57]Might be in a box somewhere.
[194:35.97]I hold on to a lot of stuff.
[194:37.01]Especially stream stuff.
[194:43.47]I mean, that Reddit shelf, I know is a joke, but it's kind of nice to just remember things that you've done.
[194:49.66]Like, oh yeah, I remember that.
[194:55.15]Like a little token.
[194:58.97]I think I, I'm pretty sure I still have it.
[195:00.23]I think it's in a box.
[195:14.59]Alright.
[195:16.55]Where do we put the birdhouse?
[195:24.06]Maybe they hang out right here?
[195:28.14]Away from the foot traffic.
[195:29.02]We don't want to scare them.
[195:34.89]Oh, what?
[195:35.15]Hanging out by the wheat.
[195:44.31]Closer to the window.
[195:45.01]I think back here is alright.
[195:50.60]No, that's too loud.
[195:51.60]Too many sounds.
[195:52.30]I think back here is fine.
[195:54.30]Right here.
[195:54.68]Behind the well.
[195:59.49]Yeah, right here.
[196:01.23]Okay.
[196:03.99]There it is.
[196:04.33]Now we just wait.
[196:28.30]Okay, I got my new bench.
[196:30.54]Should I make another table?
[196:33.94]I'll just say no.
[196:42.57]Alright, soup, bread.
[196:46.85]Maybe I should make a roasted chicken.
[196:50.21]Maybe that's a good idea.
[196:52.03]I could do any one of these right now.
[196:54.05]Soup.
[196:55.53]Try to go down sausage.
[196:59.96]Alright, I can make roast fish, roast chicken, roast beef, roast pork, roast barley.
[197:04.66]I can make roasted barley.
[197:09.70]Maybe I'll do that now.
[197:18.69]I want to cultivate the wheat because I want to make a wheat beer.
[197:31.78]Alright, when I go to bed and wake up, we're doing a resource day.
[197:35.09]And then... I will make my two beers and then I'm gonna open the store.
[197:45.63]Roast chicken sounds delicious.
[197:52.76]It does.
[197:53.14]It does.
[197:55.56]Do you like ketchup and grilled cheese?
[198:00.56]Yeah.
[198:11.50]That's good.
[198:16.10]Okay.
[198:21.31]You see, it probably takes a few days.
[198:27.13]Stardew Valley and some of this stuff takes a long time.
[198:29.35]I imagine it's probably only a day or two.
[198:30.68]Alright, resource time.
[198:41.80]What's the worst thing to put on a steak?
[198:48.49]I don't know.
[198:52.47]Do you mean a steak that's cooked on the grill, not like a steak sandwich?
[198:58.57]I think the easiest answer is... Not very many condiments I don't think would go well on a steak.
[199:15.37]I don't eat very much steak, but I can't imagine.
[199:18.13]I mean, I like mushrooms.
[199:21.96]Mushrooms on a steak, onions on a steak.
[199:24.80]Steak and eggs is really good from what I remember.
[199:27.74]I remember being like, oh yeah, that's great.
[199:33.85]Steak and eggs sounds great right now, doesn't it?
[199:48.66]From what you remember, I haven't had it in a long time.
[200:06.25]Steak is nasty.
[200:10.75]I mean, look, I would sit here and agree with you.
[200:14.01]I would sit here and say, yeah, you're right.
[200:17.11]But I would be full of shit.
[200:23.59]I like steak and cheese subs and sandwiches.
[200:25.90]I like them.
[200:29.60]Hamburger.
[200:30.12]Alright.
[200:33.06]That's essentially beef.
[200:40.42]The idea of a big, meaty steak, though, is not appetizing to me.
[200:45.01]I'm like, eh, no.
[200:46.37]No, thank you.
[200:49.47]Steak to me is a rare thing that happens every so often.
[200:53.24]Sometimes.
[200:59.19]me having a steak a steak steak that fork and knife steak it's probably realistically only and I'm people are gonna be like what the is going on over here it's probably realistically only a few times a year a fork and knife steak is only a few times a year for me with that being said I eat hamburgers all the time I eat beef I mean frequently I love carne asada tacos
[201:30.25]But no, not really a big fan of just the steak with a fork and knife on a plate Never really did it for me anyways Okay, so now I can buy that calendar that wants me to a specific quest
[201:59.94]Hey, it got cheaper.
[202:01.69]Oops.
[202:11.74]What is that reward?
[202:16.34]A lot of shit stake opinions being thrown around in here.
[202:19.57]Yeah, I mean...
[202:23.14]Well, to be fair, there are 15,000 people here.
[202:26.18]Who knows what everybody's diet looks like.
[202:29.20]You got a pretty large sample of people here.
[202:30.94]I feel like there's lots of opinions with the 15,000 people.
[202:52.88]How do you like your steak cooked?
[202:56.72]Whatever, I'll just get like a thousand on followers.
[202:58.76]I just, whatever.
[203:01.61]I like steak, I will say medium in a restaurant setting.
[203:08.09]I will say medium and then I'll kind of, I'll put my hand up.
[203:11.88]I'll say, I'll take medium and then the waiter's definitely like, alright, I know what, here it comes.
[203:17.80]medium well media like I I order a steak medium at a restaurant because I think that's how you do it but for me personally I prefer not medium well I wish there was another tier because there is well done medium well medium I like the in between between medium and medium well
[203:49.26]You know what I mean?
[203:50.12]I like that area in between medium to the second tier.
[203:56.95]I like, I don't like it any other way, really.
[204:03.19]Medium rare to me is just not, just no thanks.
[204:08.33]And rare?
[204:09.95]No.
[204:11.88]You want the non-centrist take?
[204:14.28]Fine.
[204:15.80]Take a stance, Andy.
[204:17.16]Take a stance, Andy.
[204:19.74]That term doesn't even make sense right now.
[204:21.54]And I don't even know why I keep saying that term.
[204:23.02]You want me to take a stance?
[204:25.68]I think rare steak is fucking disgusting.
[204:27.88]There you go.
[204:28.68]I just think rare steak is gross.
[204:30.76]I'm sorry.
[204:31.56]That's just the way I felt since I was a kid.
[204:34.26]All the way through my teenage years.
[204:36.32]Rare steak, I think, is not... It's unappetizing to me.
[204:41.21]Medium rare.
[204:42.77]Medium rare, on the other hand, is like, okay, I get you.
[204:45.63]I get you.
[204:46.67]Rare?
[204:46.99]I do not find it to be appetizing at all.
[204:51.33]Fine, I took a stance.
[204:52.11]Finally.
[204:53.37]Took me 13 years of doing YouTube and Twitch before you got a real fucking take from me.
[205:01.87]Rare steak is disgusting.
[205:04.61]Took you 13 years.
[205:05.69]You finally got something out of me.
[205:14.14]He's so brave.
[205:16.82]Alright, let me go back.
[205:20.56]Oh, I got deliveries.
[205:33.43]Show the... Hold on.
[205:34.47]I'll show this.
[205:34.99]Alright, I'm gonna show meat on... Okay, let me show some steak.
[205:40.17]Where I would say I like it.
[205:47.06]Not a bad idea.
[205:56.19]Stages of steak doneness.
[206:01.15]Alright, let's put this on camera.
[206:08.96]Right, okay, so yeah.
[206:13.80]Medium to medium well I think is perfect.
[206:18.01]Rare?
[206:18.35]Anything under blue, like blue rare?
[206:20.51]Uh-uh.
[206:23.28]No, medium is, I think medium's where it's at.
[206:26.82]I understand medium rare.
[206:28.40]I like medium.
[206:30.46]Medium to medium well.
[206:32.46]And honestly, I will try to cook my own steaks to be medium, but I get a little paranoid and I end up making it medium well almost accidentally.
[206:43.35]Medium is, is fine.
[206:44.87]Medium's perfectly fine.
[206:48.44]If you ordered a medium rare steak, and I was sitting next to you at a restaurant, I would say, nice dude, cool.
[206:54.58]That sounds good.
[206:57.04]But I would not order a rare steak.
[207:00.20]No, I just don't like it.
[207:05.30]If you ordered a rare steak, and I was sitting at a restaurant, I'd be like, ooh, okay.
[207:10.41]Alright.
[207:11.33]Rare.
[207:12.57]Rare steak, alright.
[207:13.99]Damn.
[207:15.05]Damn, really?
[207:16.09]Rare.
[207:21.57]I've had blue rare before.
[207:24.23]Blue rare steak is seared on the outside almost entirely raw or uncooked in the middle.
[207:28.08]It's called very rare or blood rare.
[207:32.10]In contrast, rare steak is cooked longer so the middle is warm but still very red without melting the fat in the meat.
[207:37.44]Huh.
[207:41.08]I'm curious, yeah.
[207:42.72]Be honest, what do you actually prefer?
[207:51.23]Yeah, I don't know if I want my steak to be classified as blue, right?
[207:55.65]How would you like your steak?
[207:56.79]I'll take blue, please.
[207:59.69]I don't want it to be a... Uh-uh.
[208:03.65]Can it be a steak?
[208:06.43]Blue rare is safe to eat.
[208:09.21]I mean, I'm not arguing if you should or shouldn't.
[208:12.79]I'm just saying I do not find it to be appetizing.
[208:21.96]blue is there an option for steak is boring um yeah I just I would just wouldn't answer it medium a lot of medium rares a lot of medium friends though I'm seeing a lot of medium friends in here
[208:45.97]Okay, so for all you medium-rare enjoyers, if you're at the restaurant and somebody orders a medium steak next to you, you're cool with that.
[208:54.47]That's cool to you.
[208:55.33]It's like, yeah, of course, that's fine.
[208:57.87]Right?
[209:01.13]Yeah, of course.
[209:08.49]What about medium-well?
[209:10.21]Medium-well is fine.
[209:11.27]Hey, how about this?
[209:11.99]Let people eat the food they fucking want to eat.
[209:14.38]How does that sound?
[209:21.68]Even if somebody ordered a blue rare steak and I was sitting at the restaurant, I would... I would internally be like, holy shit, wow, that's... I've never happened to hear very many people order like that before.
[209:32.42]But I'm not gonna be like, ugh, what the hell's... What the fuck, dude?
[209:37.63]No, you like it?
[209:38.43]Eat it.
[209:39.11]Hopefully you enjoy it.
[209:39.85]50% say medium rare.
[209:46.61]Hmm.
[209:53.36]That's actually pretty, that's really interesting to me.
[209:55.08]Alright, any more quests?
[210:01.23]No.
[210:02.37]Time to open the store.
[210:04.39]Time to make some money.
[210:11.40]Only 8% for well done.
[210:17.53]There's a couple of important distinctions to make, I think, with, um, with Well Done.
[210:25.26]I wouldn't order a cheese steak with rare steak in it.
[210:30.18]I wouldn't.
[210:30.92]I think there's a different flavor profile there.
[210:37.56]Does that make sense?
[210:45.35]I think that most cheese steaks, to me, need to be at least medium to medium well.
[210:51.01]Depends on the cut of meat.
[210:51.89]Yeah, exactly.
[210:52.73]We're talking steak as in the cut.
[210:57.09]Yeah.
[211:01.25]We really do only talk about food.
[211:05.92]If you put together every single moment I've been on stream, you could probably extract 30 full seasons of a food podcast out of it.
[211:19.15]Cooking with Jerma.
[211:22.47]It would probably last like 30 straight seasons.
[211:26.62]If you just took the food conversations.
[211:33.22]What even?
[211:34.48]What is that?
[211:37.73]It's like a refinery or something.
[211:41.84]What is this?
[211:47.58]Stone block?
[211:49.20]Polished stone.
[211:52.91]Okay.
[211:53.13]I don't need fuel.
[211:55.89]Alright.
[212:04.14]Time to open this door.
[212:12.44]We got plenty of beer.
[212:14.10]I got my new concoction.
[212:16.14]Open.
[212:22.22]Candles?
[212:25.92]I can place them during the game day.
[212:27.56]Hold on.
[212:34.98]I'm just making it nice.
[212:35.82]Hold on.
[212:38.94]I know everyone's excited for Gruul.
[212:55.70]How much does it cost?
[212:56.48]150?
[212:57.08]I feel like that's not that much.
[213:03.81]That kind of sucks.
[213:05.15]I feel like that kind of sucks.
[213:08.27]This place is bollocks.
[213:27.61]Get out of here.
[213:38.53]How do I put this in here?
[213:42.76]I don't know.
[213:51.82]That was a blue rare enjoyer.
[213:59.12]Too hot?
[213:59.68]Sorry.
[214:01.11]Sorry!
[214:06.36]It's filthy shit.
[214:30.34]I need some better food.
[214:31.10]The food is where you make all the money.
[214:32.44]Yeah.
[214:37.63]I was selling those porridges for, what, two silver?
[214:58.87]Can we have this be a poll stream?
[215:01.27]Or just ask questions and poll the chat?
[215:04.83]Yeah.
[215:28.42]It's a good way to farm.
[215:29.30]Viewer engage... These drinks are watered down.
[215:32.14]I don't like the beer.
[215:36.73]It's a good way for viewer engagement.
[215:39.59]Yeah.
[215:41.23]But, I mean... I don't have to engage you guys 24-7 here.
[215:53.25]More polls.
[215:54.01]More polls.
[215:54.63]Alright, how about the poll with this?
[215:55.71]It's your, um...
[216:01.51]How's this for a pull?
[216:07.94]I don't know.
[216:27.63]Does Coca-Cola taste better out of an aluminum can or a glass bottle?
[216:33.76]Run that one, I guess.
[216:34.52]I don't know.
[216:59.70]I have a pros and cons for either one.
[217:04.32]Coca-Cola or any soda out of an aluminum can to me can be somehow is colder.
[217:10.68]I feel like anytime I've had any soda out of a glass bottle, it's been the preferred way for me.
[217:17.20]But it almost feels like it's not as cold somehow.
[217:22.12]Even if you get it to a point where it's nice and cold, it's not quite as frosty, chilled as a freezing aluminum, like a freezing cold aluminum can.
[217:29.46]I don't know why.
[217:42.01]Hand coke is crispy.
[217:49.73]It's funny, I actually... My favorite way to have a soda like that is in a cooler covered in ice.
[217:59.80]It's buried.
[218:01.26]You have to dig in and actually pull that shit out of the ice from the cooler.
[218:05.58]And it's an aluminum can.
[218:07.24]And that shit is freezing.
[218:09.50]And it is just... Boom!
[218:11.26]And it makes that exploding sound, right?
[218:15.58]And it's just so cold and so perfect on like a summer day.
[218:19.30]There you go.
[218:19.62]And I add this to the food podcast playlist.
[218:32.73]When I run out of this beer... Oh.
[218:34.29]We're closed.
[218:50.01]Kill your coke in glasses?
[218:53.23]I do prefer... I actually like it out of a glass container.
[218:57.94]And I probably agree with that, but...
[219:02.39]Sometimes you can't beat the can.
[219:06.37]You know what I really prefer in the aluminum can?
[219:09.19]Oh, man.
[219:10.23]And it's honestly, you want a food take here?
[219:14.45]It's only gotten better.
[219:16.17]It's just gotten better.
[219:20.77]Risk iced tea out of the can.
[219:22.28]It's only gotten better as we've gone forward here.
[219:38.54]A nice freezing cold brisk iced tea.
[219:41.50]It's actually really bad.
[219:42.63]Because anytime I've had brisk iced tea, why is it like this?
[219:48.15]Why?
[219:48.45]I feel like when I open a can of brisk iced tea, I have to go like... And half the can's gone.
[220:00.06]It's almost like that's what you do when you open one of those.
[220:05.36]And it's just... In almost two or three moments, you look at it and go, wait a minute.
[220:11.46]I just opened this fucking thing.
[220:15.87]Yeah, to me, a brisk iced tea is... You are sweating.
[220:21.43]It's hot out.
[220:23.05]It is really, really... Wow, the sun is... I'm wiping the sweat off my brow.
[220:28.00]Boom.
[220:28.72]Ice cold brisk iced tea.
[220:30.62]Smash.
[220:31.36]Slam that shit.
[220:33.66]That's to me how that works.
[220:38.04]That's one of the number one ways to enjoy that.
[220:41.48]What are you talking about?
[220:42.48]I'm talking about brisk iced tea.
[220:44.08]You never had it?
[220:44.56]Alright, I want to do wheat.
[220:59.31]The wheat will probably be ready tomorrow.
[221:07.69]This is surprising to me too.
[221:08.77]Let me see.
[221:09.26]I mean, I want to make sure I don't say this wrong.
[221:14.68]I was actually surprised.
[221:17.04]Last time I had brisk ice tea was kind of not a long time ago, but I feel like it was a lot less sugar than I thought was in the can.
[221:36.66]Because, like, a bottle of... Oh, not a bottle.
[221:38.91]Like, a can of Coke is, what, 30-something grams of sugar?
[221:44.24]I want to say it's under 20 for a brisk ice tea.
[221:49.96]And I remember looking at that and going, wait a minute, really?
[221:51.71]That's kind of surprising.
[222:02.67]Let's look this up.
[222:03.83]Risk ice tea likes sugar.
[222:04.87]I promise you, it was surprising.
[222:12.39]In a 12 ounce can.
[222:16.66]Well, not a 12 ounce can.
[222:17.60]I remember looking at it.
[222:28.88]Is this accurate?
[222:29.50]I don't think that's accurate.
[222:35.72]20 grams?
[222:36.04]17 grams?
[222:39.94]17 grams is in the can, apparently.
[222:41.50]Which, I mean, that's still... I mean, it's a lot of sugar.
[222:44.70]It still is.
[222:45.28]But it's not, like, 30 plus.
[222:46.64]17 grams.
[222:46.98]Coke is 39.
[222:55.63]Yeah.
[223:02.37]Hey, look.
[223:03.71]Is this ready?
[223:04.17]I thought I just ruined everything.
[223:18.72]Wet socks for 24 hours or no underwear for a week?
[223:22.80]I mean, that's a no-brainer to me.
[223:25.48]I could hand... I don't... Actually, wait a minute.
[223:32.93]thought that was actually I don't know that's I yeah maybe I would just maybe pick the no underwear for a week does not go anywhere and just stay here fucking
[224:04.57]Malted wheat.
[224:08.97]Wheat flour.
[224:09.63]Just wear pajamas for a week.
[224:22.68]Yeah, that makes sense.
[224:24.54]Ooh, you like me.
[224:28.54]Roasted barley.
[224:29.34]Alright, look at all this.
[224:32.70]I'm gonna make a barley snack.
[224:43.66]Do you not wear underwear with pajamas?
[224:48.12]Um, I mean... Are we really gonna... We're not having this conversation right now.
[225:01.77]I feel like a certain percentage of you just fucking turned your volume up and put both your headphones on and leaned in.
[225:06.44]Like, just listening intently to the next thing I was going to say.
[225:11.94]Settle down.
[225:12.68]Relax.
[225:24.50]He's gonna talk about... He's gonna talk about... He's not wearing any underwear!
[225:28.94]He's not wearing any underwear!
[225:29.80]I'm gonna... Clip it!
[225:31.96]Clip it!
[225:32.32]Clip it!
[225:35.54]Oh, fuck.
[225:35.90]I just... Whatever.
[225:36.98]I wanna make my beer!
[225:49.79]My bitter wheat beer.
[225:52.01]I want it to be gross.
[225:59.69]I need water.
[226:12.58]It's really funny because I actually do... I do like wheat beer.
[226:17.74]I think wheat beer is the only beer that I really would actually enjoy drinking.
[226:20.32]It's kind of funny making my favorite beer.
[226:35.27]Wheat.
[226:36.31]With a T. Wheat.
[226:37.51]Not weed.
[226:38.49]Wheat.
[226:41.03]Can you say wheatwort ten times fast?
[226:42.89]Probably.
[226:45.41]Wheatwort.
[226:45.81]Wheatwort.
[226:46.24]Wheatwort.
[226:46.64]Wheatwort.
[226:47.10]Wheatwort.
[226:48.16]Goes in ten, but it was pretty quick, man.
[227:01.33]Can we please talk about Arnold Palmer's now?
[227:03.91]Arnold Palmer's are really good.
[227:09.81]That's all I have to say about that apparently.
[227:18.96]Favorite fry dipping sauce.
[227:25.32]I find it so funny.
[227:26.74]I don't know.
[227:27.02]I'm just imagining that we're all at Comic Con and it's I have a panel or something and Everyone's getting up to the microphone asking their question to the guy that's at the panel And you're asking me these questions.
[227:42.65]Oh Hey, hey Jerma.
[227:43.59]I just have a quick question.
[227:44.94]What's your favorite fry dipping sauce?
[227:47.99]Uh, well, that would be, um, I don't know.
[227:50.67]I like honey mustard or ketchup.
[227:53.23]I'm a ketchup guy sometimes.
[227:55.33]Oh, cool.
[227:55.65]Okay.
[227:56.09]Thank you.
[227:57.03]The next person.
[227:58.57]Do you order medium rare or is it medium steak?
[228:01.79]Well, that's a good question.
[228:02.61]I appreciate the comment.
[228:04.05]I think that, I mean, I do like a medium to medium well.
[228:07.71]I like a medium steak.
[228:09.15]Oh, awesome.
[228:09.65]Thanks.
[228:10.95]Hey, dude, what's the hottest level of chili pepper you're willing to eat?
[228:15.16]Awesome question.
[228:15.72]Thanks for asking that.
[228:17.00]And this is what I do for like an hour and a half.
[228:29.06]Alright, I want my wheat beer.
[228:30.21]Come on, hurry up.
[228:40.95]And we just have that stream forever.
[228:42.57]I feel like after this many years, you guys have most of my food preferences and beverage preferences down to a T. I'm just gonna go to bed and wake up.
[229:10.07]And then finish it.
[229:25.06]Okay, there's wheat wort.
[229:27.34]Wheat ale.
[229:28.20]Wow.
[229:28.92]This is worth a lot more than this.
[229:32.06]Why did I even go down this path?
[229:36.97]24.
[229:37.13]Everything else is 61.
[229:38.35]These are way better.
[229:41.53]Honey wheat with a little bit of bitter in it?
[229:43.59]Let's go.
[229:48.77]I'm going to bed.
[229:49.73]No, I'll do a collection day.
[229:51.63]Because I want food in here too.
[230:02.62]Can I sell the roasted barley?
[230:09.02]I can't.
[230:09.60]I can't put the roasted barley up into the bar?
[230:15.46]That's technically food, right?
[230:16.66]Hmm.
[230:24.98]Hey Jerm, I heard you once ate an entire kong full of peanut butter.
[230:34.17]Oh man.
[230:44.04]Expensive.
[230:49.32]Kong with peanut butter and.
[230:58.20]Are curly fries better?
[230:59.22]It depends on the day.
[231:05.36]Sometimes I prefer a fry that's very firm and crunchy.
[231:10.44]Sometimes I prefer some curly fries.
[231:12.57]It depends on the day.
[231:17.47]We're all such complex beings.
[231:35.76]Fry wedges?
[231:47.03]I get more food-related questions than cooking channels.
[231:52.64]You know, I'm not even that- I'm not even upset about it.
[231:55.48]I like to like talk.
[231:56.28]I love food.
[231:59.34]I really do.
[231:59.70]Food's like one of my favorite things ever.
[232:06.60]Honestly, some of my fondest memories were around kind of eating something and hanging out.
[232:15.67]Not only do I have the memory of the thing that I thought was interesting, I have the memory of the food I was eating.
[232:24.65]Pretty cool.
[232:25.85]Pretty cool.
[232:31.61]Aging shelf.
[232:32.21]That's probably for wine, maybe?
[232:34.28]Or whiskey or something.
[232:37.39]My beer ready yet.
[232:38.09]I need some more seeds.
[232:54.60]I have so much corn in my inventory and I don't even know what to do with it.
[233:02.31]I'll get... I'll get some rye seeds.
[233:14.90]Good idea.
[233:15.12]Anybody in there?
[233:28.23]Not yet.
[233:39.24]Taste is said to be linked to memory.
[233:42.92]Yeah.
[233:44.03]Smells are like that too.
[233:44.87]I don't know if I could really do a full on what is your favorite foods.
[234:08.75]Buffalo chicken is up there at least in one of the top three.
[234:17.86]And let me make this clarified.
[234:19.37]Not buffalo chicken wings.
[234:24.13]Buffalo chicken cutlets?
[234:26.79]Buffalo chicken tenders.
[234:28.31]Buffalo chicken cutlets.
[234:30.87]I don't... I like wings, but it's not as good for me as the, uh, like the cutlet version.
[234:35.49]Like in a sub.
[234:36.47]Buffalo chicken sub is... I would be... I'm like the dog running around in the fucking bacon commercial.
[234:43.38]Like, gimme, gimme, gimme, it's bacon!
[234:45.30]That's me with a buffalo chicken sub.
[234:48.56]Fucking begging strips, dog.
[235:02.52]Salmon is up there too.
[235:03.64]I'd say at least in the top five.
[235:07.26]I'm making materials while I wait.
[235:21.29]Yeah, pretty much a chicken cutlet.
[235:25.28]Flat chicken cutlet is... I mean, you can turn that into, you know, buffalo chicken or chicken cutlet sandwich or chicken parm.
[235:34.72]I think that chicken cutlet is number one.
[235:36.86]So maybe it's not buffalo chicken.
[235:45.06]It's probably like the way that the chicken is prepared.
[235:48.80]Chicken cutlet.
[235:52.68]Because fried chicken is not really what I'm all about.
[235:58.81]I like fried chicken, but not that kind of KFC style.
[236:03.19]I do like it.
[236:05.17]Not the way that I like chicken cutlets.
[236:09.61]Chicken katsu?
[236:10.22]Yep.
[236:11.12]Precisely.
[236:21.45]Pesto on a scale of 1 to 10.
[236:23.69]Probably a 9.
[236:46.02]Yeah, it probably is.
[236:50.65]I have to really be in the mood for it.
[236:53.39]But... When I do like it, and I'm ready to... Oh yeah, I want that.
[236:57.75]It's definitely at least 8 or 9 at least.
[237:08.10]Oh, is Diablo 4 gonna be fun?
[237:12.02]Please, please tell me.
[237:23.42]I feel like a lot of people are probably doing this.
[237:27.67]I am setting my expectations to zero.
[237:31.95]So there's only one way to go.
[237:33.31]You know what I mean?
[237:41.19]There's only one way to go with Diablo 4 for me.
[237:44.91]Up.
[237:51.43]Is there anything else that I need that I haven't bought yet?
[237:54.49]Like a mug.
[238:00.17]I was not a huge fan of Diablo Immortal.
[238:04.02]I tried it and I was like, no, no, no, no.
[238:08.30]I just was like, no, thank you.
[238:09.70]No.
[238:15.78]I'm not a huge fan.
[238:17.59]Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of that game.
[238:37.82]I know I'm such a nostalgia person and I just want it to be this.
[238:42.54]I don't know.
[238:43.06]It's like, dude, you're boring, but that's what I want.
[238:46.18]I really just want a Diablo II that is expanded graphics or unique items.
[238:53.66]Just uniques.
[238:54.52]I love uniques.
[238:55.32]It's like one of my favorite things about that entire game.
[238:57.38]The whole franchise.
[238:59.02]Uniques.
[239:04.18]And not random uniques.
[239:06.14]I like randomness.
[239:08.40]But only built into the item itself.
[239:11.69]So for instance, if you have a pair of gloves.
[239:14.73]And that pair of gloves is 100 to 150% enhanced defense.
[239:21.35]And then between 5 and 10 strength.
[239:25.27]And then this between... Randomness inside the item is fine.
[239:29.60]But I want the item to be unique.
[239:31.22]I want the item to be a unique item.
[239:46.06]Yeah, that's... I just... I want more of that.
[239:50.42]I feel like a lot of the games, I mean, recently, it's kind of just... Just throw a bunch of random fucking numbers on everything.
[240:00.98]Like, here's a sword, and it's got, like, a bunch of crazy fixes on it, and it's just a bunch of... Look at how crazy it is.
[240:07.23]There we go.
[240:12.55]Finally, Weedale.
[240:13.33]Let's go.
[240:13.65]Time to open.
[240:17.30]So I've got this one.
[240:19.16]This is my wheat ale.
[240:23.60]I'm gonna make the stew because it sells really well and it's the only thing I can make.
[240:29.69]I'm just gonna make corn.
[240:33.37]A spicy corn and wheat.
[240:37.78]Spicy corn porridge with wheat sprinkles.
[240:56.14]Never got into Diablo, feels like a ton of shit's happening and I need the wiki pulled up for everything.
[241:02.74]New Diablo is like that.
[241:10.89]Diablo II was pretty easy to understand.
[241:13.23]Diablo II, I feel like it was just, is this thing better than what I have on?
[241:24.17]It's very simple to know.
[241:28.15]And I know it's really simple to know the other games too, but I don't... I don't know.
[241:35.08]I don't think you need a wiki for Diablo II.
[241:37.34]It's just... Diablo II is more about the skills than it is about anything else.
[241:43.95]Learning what synergizes with what and where you want to put your points.
[241:52.55]Diablo II is just get plus skill level stuff.
[241:55.56]That's what you're striving to do.
[241:57.40]And then something else is important too.
[242:03.96]I have enough.
[242:05.82]I'll be making money today.
[242:07.04]Alright, I've got corn.
[242:15.84]This is corn, chili, starch.
[242:19.46]Veggie, starchy, seedy.
[242:21.82]What?
[242:23.18]That sounds awful.
[242:27.04]If you explained to me a soup that was seedy, starchy, with veggies in it, I'd be like, well, I'm not ordering that.
[242:35.19]But it's okay, because this is a video game.
[242:36.67]Alright, I'm ready to open.
[242:41.79]Nope.
[242:46.63]I forgot to put the other bench down, but whatever.
[242:48.47]Can I do it now?
[242:50.77]We're closed.
[243:04.91]Okay, we're open.
[243:25.03]That's a lot.
[243:25.65]330 for that?
[243:26.11]160 and 330.
[243:39.94]Alright, let me get everybody at a table and then I'll clean.
[243:42.14]350 actually, 360.
[243:44.26]Is the cat helping you serve?
[243:55.13]That's funny, but I don't think so.
[244:03.11]Have enough beer?
[244:07.47]Everybody doing alright?
[244:08.23]Everything clean?
[244:21.43]Where are the cats just hanging out?
[244:35.68]Too hot?
[244:36.32]Alright.
[244:44.52]One gold is 100.
[244:45.46]Yeah, it's kind of a... 100 copper is one silver.
[244:49.96]100 silver is one gold.
[245:04.36]A tavern.
[245:12.58]It was worth waiting for the Weeper.
[245:20.32]What's up the stairs?
[245:21.50]I think it's a... It's another storage room.
[245:33.27]Must have two gold.
[245:39.67]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[245:40.57]I didn't mean to bump that.
[245:42.53]You can play Dead Rising again.
[245:43.53]Oh yeah, that's not what you asked.
[245:45.89]You said, when is the Dead Rising stream?
[245:47.98]I played the first two.
[245:52.14]I played the third one almost, what, a decade ago with Ster.
[245:57.12]But we kind of just messed around.
[245:58.28]We didn't really actually try to play the game for real.
[246:01.43]Maybe I would just stream it.
[246:07.01]Those Dead Rising 2 streams are some of, I think, the... I feel like that's some of the most fun I've had on broadcast ever.
[246:16.03]That game was out of control at some points.
[246:19.00]Dead Rising 1 and Dead Rising 2.
[246:20.10]These games are so much fun.
[246:35.90]But Dead Rising 4.
[246:37.16]Dead Rising 4 I think was a monumental disappointment.
[246:40.52]I think I streamed it.
[246:42.47]And it just wasn't very good.
[246:47.37]Or just not.
[246:47.77]It wasn't what I wanted.
[246:48.45]It wasn't what I was expecting.
[246:54.07]Didn't have very much fun playing it.
[247:03.94]You know, I always thought that's something that they were going to do.
[247:06.32]They did the mall.
[247:07.34]It was like, oh, the mall.
[247:08.72]You're in the mall.
[247:09.34]Look at all the stuff at the mall.
[247:11.68]I was under the impression.
[247:12.44]I was like, you know what?
[247:13.42]What if I'm thinking, okay, they're doing, where's a place with a ton of random shit, kind of random stuff.
[247:21.49]I thought they were going to go to an amusement park.
[247:24.55]Imagine like roller coasters and stuff.
[247:25.97]And like all the zombies, like imagine that how crazy that would be.
[247:46.72]You can do a full amusement park.
[247:53.80]And I think that keeps it fresh.
[247:56.30]Just think about all the random encounters you could do with the midway games and roller coasters and different rides and different bosses that would be... I imagine you can fight somebody, a boss, on one of the roller coasters.
[248:07.76]Wouldn't that be awesome?
[248:10.43]It could be a whole giant cinematic scene where you fight a boss on the roller coaster.
[248:24.20]I'm going to go through all this inventory if I have it.
[248:25.67]I'm not supposed to stay open.
[248:33.38]You can do that in the Jimmy Neutron game.
[248:38.36]That's pretty fun.
[248:58.61]Oh, this person's gonna get pissed.
[249:16.64]I can make at least another 40 or 50 silver here.
[249:19.84]Unless it might get too late.
[249:20.62]People might leave.
[249:25.73]Please play Jimmy Neutron Attack of the Twonkies.
[249:29.81]That sounds like a made-up game.
[249:41.44]He didn't just make that up.
[249:57.66]Now it's real, okay.
[250:05.68]Can I fire wood here?
[250:12.31]Yep.
[250:20.75]What Nickelodeon character wouldn't survive the zombie apocalypse?
[250:34.33]Patrick Patrick is fine
[251:05.79]I don't know.
[251:15.50]I feel like Patrick would just think it was like something wasn't dangerous was happening or something.
[251:20.34]Like, oh, here's a bunch of new friends in town or something, right?
[251:27.90]Patrick, no, those are zombies.
[251:32.51]Patrick, be careful.
[251:34.77]Don't go near those things.
[251:36.06]Those are zombies, Patrick.
[252:05.52]What's wrong with me?
[252:06.60]Oh, shit.
[252:07.08]I gotta close.
[252:07.82]Everybody, hurry up and get out of here.
[252:15.15]Alright, everybody, get out.
[252:21.78]Thank you.
[252:22.16]I appreciate it.
[252:22.68]That was a really good day.
[252:23.74]Get out.
[252:41.54]One last spot to clean.
[252:44.92]It's 3 a.m.
[252:55.17]I feel like you started streaming and then we instantly just asked a bunch of questions.
[253:01.84]This was kind of just like a question stream.
[253:04.44]That's fine.
[253:04.76]We're just hanging on.
[253:24.84]I want bigger tables, but... Let me see.
[253:28.15]I have a lot of experience points.
[253:29.79]I could go for wine.
[253:34.31]Well, not yet, actually.
[253:43.44]Soup.
[253:44.36]Oh, here we go.
[253:44.86]Sausages.
[253:45.84]Where do I get meat?
[253:48.62]Where do I get meat from?
[253:49.54]I want apples.
[253:55.44]Berries.
[253:55.86]Alright, let's do apples and berries.
[254:00.24]Let me go check out the town.
[254:10.19]I feel like it's been a while.
[254:14.35]Wait, what about the calendar?
[254:15.87]Eh, whatever.
[254:21.46]Didn't it say to take a look at the calendar?
[254:23.56]Because there's events, right?
[254:31.81]I guess not.
[254:32.37]I need more of these tanks.
[254:56.66]Because I really should have more than one.
[254:57.83]Go explore today?
[255:06.25]Yeah.
[255:07.45]That's probably the plan.
[255:13.18]Is it done?
[255:14.46]No.
[255:16.62]I'm going to go down.
[255:32.83]I wonder if that just freaked you out.
[255:36.07]What if it was three?
[255:45.98]That's like an X out the window, shot down computer.
[255:50.62]What the fuck?
[256:12.99]This is like a Stardew-like.
[256:14.13]How is it?
[256:17.47]So far, it's... It is very much like Stardew.
[256:23.87]I think it's a lot more about... To me, I would put the actual video gameplay to something more like Diner Dash in a way.
[256:38.36]like serving and then running around and wiping the tables and the customer's complaining and it's kind of like that in a way and I imagine later on in the game probably gets a little more hectic but there are you know all these crafting and resource management and I don't see any there's no birds for the birds
[257:08.47]I think, is this still in early access or is this out in 1.0?
[257:10.83]I think it's early access still.
[257:25.06]Well, okay, if you like Stardew Valley and you like alcohol.
[257:29.13]I guess.
[257:29.43]Because this is, you just, you run a tavern.
[257:48.21]Twitch chat is such a funny place, it really is, because in between- in- in between- Hey, um, what do you think about this game?
[257:54.91]This is a really interesting video game that kind of, like, looks like Stardew Valley.
[257:57.91]What's your opinion on it?
[257:59.55]Oh, hey, dude, like, do you like medium rare steak?
[258:01.59]Hit someone in the fucking head with your axe.
[258:06.22]There's so many different worlds going on.
[258:08.24]There's so many different things happening at once.
[258:11.74]It's such an interesting, uh, dichotomy.
[258:31.76]I want to spend some money on something nice.
[258:34.32]I have three gold.
[258:35.46]What am I buying?
[258:53.18]Drying mat?
[259:04.86]When you shut down your computer, do you close everything first?
[259:08.14]Usually, yeah.
[259:09.82]I always hate seeing that, um, that screen.
[259:15.24]Especially in Windows, when you're shutting something down and it's, you know, your computer's almost like, hey, dude.
[259:20.99]Some programs are not closed.
[259:23.17]What's wrong with you?
[259:24.45]What are you thinking?
[259:26.73]And it just goes, oh, fuck, oh, it's gonna close them automatically?
[259:28.99]No, what do I do?
[259:29.59]Cancel.
[259:32.97]Alright, I got blueberry seeds.
[259:33.81]Let's make this a little bigger.
[259:34.61]Because if I'm going to have blueberries and stuff, I want it to be bigger.
[259:37.18]What's this shovel?
[259:57.79]Hmm...
[259:59.56]apples and then I'll just make two more little areas I bought 40 of each I'm realizing that was probably not a good idea
[260:51.81]Are you digging like this because I've messed it up and I want to make sure I'll patch out the one hold on Okay, um Okay, so now that's how many is this total I
[262:28.03]40 41.
[262:28.17]46.
[262:28.23]OK.
[262:29.91]So 46 I need to take away six spaces.
[263:00.03]Should I take him out of the middle?
[263:01.87]Would it be more aesthetically pleasing if it was in the middle?
[263:12.24]One... One, two... Or one, two, three...
[263:57.84]This is kind of just a big booger in the middle, but it'll be alright.
[264:10.40]It's uneven.
[264:11.70]I'll fix it.
[264:19.99]Alright, this is going to be apples.
[264:22.61]I almost tried to just plant the porridges.
[264:37.65]This is not right They're trees I for some reason was like why can I buy so many of these I
[264:58.57]I have 40.
[265:02.08]Okay.
[265:04.90]I need to make... We're going to have a whole orchard here.
[265:12.80]No, no, no, no, no.
[265:14.10]Remove.
[265:15.14]Blueberries are going here.
[265:15.98]Remove, remove, remove it.
[265:16.98]How do I undo it?
[265:31.25]Okay.
[265:32.65]There we go.
[265:33.51]Alright.
[265:41.03]Blueberries.
[265:41.63]Here they come.
[265:50.61]I have one left.
[265:52.07]I didn't calculate this right.
[266:07.22]I got an idea.
[266:21.96]Is the bar open?
[266:22.92]No, I... It is.
[266:25.08]Oh, shit!
[266:29.65]Oh!
[266:30.11]I'm sorry!
[266:31.35]I didn't mean... Here, take some stew!
[266:38.15]everybody's so hungry what is he doing out there he's he's trying to plant a bunch of he he's trying to plant 40 different apple trees oh thank god everything's fine no I'm sorry I just screamed but it was actually scary I thought I was gonna lose or something
[267:09.64]Why is the store open?
[267:11.04]How did I not... Oh, this drink sucks.
[267:17.65]It's because I don't have anything on tap.
[267:20.37]What are they even drinking?
[267:22.11]Oh, no.
[267:22.95]Oh, no.
[267:23.19]I'm going to have to attack somebody.
[267:24.65]I'm sorry.
[267:27.59]Alright.
[267:27.83]Now, get out.
[267:28.37]Get out of here.
[267:29.29]I'm sorry I opened up so late.
[267:31.09]But there's no need to throw stuff at people and attack anybody.
[267:38.60]I'm serving water.
[267:39.84]Make it nice and toasty in here.
[267:57.12]It's only grilled.
[267:59.00]That's the only thing I have.
[267:59.68]Alright.
[268:03.16]We're closed.
[268:03.76]Thanks for coming in.
[268:05.52]I'm going to get such a bad rating.
[268:06.60]I'm going to rage quit the stream, I think.
[268:14.22]They're all going to give negative.
[268:15.24]I'm going to lose negative experience.
[268:28.13]How?
[268:34.09]I spent two or three days crafting a recipe and making honey wheat beer with like a hint of Cayenne pepper in it.
[268:44.81]And I get shit on.
[268:46.95]I serve gruel out of a fucking... an old refrigerator out back.
[268:53.78]And this... I get the rave reviews.
[268:55.44]Okay, this one is... mild ale.
[269:13.95]Did I have anything cool with this?
[269:15.17]No, I think it's just regular eel.
[269:23.68]Okay, back to what I was doing.
[269:24.96]Can I plant an apple tree in the middle?
[269:38.44]That'd be pretty cool.
[269:39.08]Damn it.
[269:45.99]Well, I'm sorry guys, but I have to plant 40 apple trees.
[269:51.65]Don't be mad at me.
[269:57.13]Shit.
[269:57.63]Okay, hold on.
[270:00.37]I mean, I bought them.
[270:02.05]It's a waste, huge waste of money if I don't.
[270:03.97]How many was it?
[270:04.49]Eight?
[270:24.97]Okay, so I need to- It's gonna take so long.
[270:31.22]You're gonna be here for days, man.
[270:39.61]It's alright.
[270:59.88]I'm not going to plant all 40, but just enough for it to make sense.
[271:02.58]Maybe 3, 4.
[271:08.42]I'll do 3.
[271:22.35]And then, yeah, okay, I'll do 4.
[271:26.11]We'll do 4 right here.
[271:27.71]That's easy.
[271:28.33]Maybe I'll just go all the way up.
[271:30.94]Yeah.
[271:31.22]Alright, I'm going all the way up.
[271:32.70]Everyone just... Look, relax.
[271:34.29]It's late at night.
[271:34.89]Just chill.
[271:35.21]Look what we're doing.
[272:09.51]It's so uneven.
[272:10.21]Okay.
[272:15.05]It doesn't matter if it's uneven.
[272:16.09]It just matters that it's there and it's growing.
[272:20.73]And look.
[272:21.03]Is it really that uneven?
[272:36.98]You're forgetting about the seeds we're planting here.
[272:42.24]Don't be an idiot.
[272:42.84]Don't be an idiot.
[273:34.47]What?
[273:34.95]I'm playing the game.
[273:36.61]This part is already done for me.
[273:50.80]That's one.
[273:51.08]What's going on here?
[274:00.26]Why can I not go this way?
[274:03.59]Okay, so what's going on?
[274:04.59]What's going on?
[274:08.03]Oh, right, because, yeah, I know what's going on.
[274:18.74]You can't do it in the area of a piece of machinery.
[274:29.22]Well, that's fantastic.
[274:30.32]Okay, um...
[274:43.97]It'll be fine.
[274:44.43]I'll just plant them here.
[274:46.95]Two more, and that's it.
[275:01.03]Oh, there's one more.
[275:01.71]One more.
[275:03.83]I gotta go bed.
[275:04.29]I'm gonna pass out.
[275:28.71]How long do these take to grow, I wonder?
[275:29.87]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[275:38.36]I'm going to bed right now.
[275:39.12]Look, see?
[275:43.94]And I'm gonna buy... a big wooden framed painting.
[275:51.63]And... a blue rug?
[275:58.84]And a couple more candles.
[276:01.73]I'm going to bed.
[276:21.08]Cool.
[276:23.16]How's our growth look?
[276:30.66]Is it ready?
[276:30.98]I think this is ready.
[276:32.63]It is.
[276:36.27]Oh, this is rye.
[276:37.11]I'm going to make a nice, super, super mild.
[276:45.24]Are these done too?
[277:05.22]Pears?
[277:06.46]Raspberries?
[277:08.48]Strawberries?
[277:10.12]What?
[277:10.88]I gotta get strawberries.
[277:17.79]Grapes?
[277:18.33]How about raspberries?
[277:27.94]I didn't mean to buy that many.
[277:28.80]I'll get 45.
[277:29.04]Pears?
[277:35.57]Alright, we got a lot of stuff incoming.
[277:49.70]Pears grow on trees.
[277:50.58]Yeah, I know, but I just bought a ton of them.
[277:52.36]They were cheap.
[278:04.66]I need to unlock rye.
[278:05.60]Here's wheat.
[278:08.56]Here's rye.
[278:10.22]Oh.
[278:13.42]I have so many of that first category.
[278:16.57]I can't even make the rye berry yet.
[278:19.25]Two more points.
[278:22.29]Why am I messing up?
[278:28.81]Alright, that's on tap right now.
[278:31.08]I have some porridges.
[278:33.58]That's the corn and rye treat one.
[278:37.66]Okay.
[278:40.02]Put the rug down.
[278:43.37]Painting up.
[278:48.13]Ooh, that's nice.
[278:48.81]Like right here.
[279:00.73]The horse?
[279:01.63]It looks like Pac-Man.
[279:09.84]Cute.
[279:16.18]Pretty good.
[279:19.03]Candles.
[279:19.43]I want to move this too.
[279:21.09]This thing's annoying.
[279:38.68]I wanna put them in here.
[279:42.13]How come I... I did it before, I don't know how to do it.
[279:53.12]That other one will burn out, it's fine.
[280:01.92]Good.
[280:09.68]Alright, almost ready.
[280:10.33]I want to... Okay, I've got a lot of shit.
[280:17.55]I don't know.
[280:17.97]Wait, I've got to put that calendar up too.
[280:20.37]Yep.
[280:26.84]Here we go.
[280:31.76]Perfect.
[280:32.02]Alright.
[280:37.49]Alright.
[280:40.41]I am almost ready to open.
[280:48.96]Apple seeds?
[280:52.34]Apple seeds, rye, and corn.
[280:55.06]Sure.
[281:08.11]Alright, wheat lager.
[281:10.87]This needs lager yeast, wheat wort, and a keg.
[281:14.33]This is ale.
[281:15.39]Let's make this.
[281:16.91]Wheat lager.
[281:17.35]I need wheat wort, which is being made right now.
[281:23.34]Is that what's being made?
[281:26.34]I believe.
[281:28.56]I need bitter hops.
[281:31.39]Okay, I need hops.
[281:32.49]Hops and what was it?
[281:37.43]Hops and lager yeast.
[281:47.16]Then I'm going to bed.
[282:00.93]Get a bunch of shit, right?
[282:13.23]It's more decor.
[282:16.45]There's so many pear trees, whatever the hell.
[282:18.57]God damn it, that's right.
[282:21.21]I'm so embarrassed.
[282:22.10]Alright, well, I'm definitely doing... Should I do strawberries or raspberries?
[282:27.16]Strawberries, for sure.
[282:49.33]And then surrounding the trees, we're going to plant raspberries.
[282:56.70]Is that possible?
[283:00.40]No.
[283:01.32]Only in certain places.
[283:02.92]That's fine.
[283:08.94]Are these ready to harvest?
[283:10.41]Probably not until tomorrow.
[283:11.07]Alright, I'm going to bed because I want to wake up and see the plants.
[283:30.05]Going to bed at 10 in the morning?
[283:31.09]Yeah, but it's the video game equivalent of time traveling to speed up the timers.
[283:34.63]The wheat.
[283:41.59]Alright, I need hops and water.
[283:46.25]Did I bump you?
[283:46.73]I'm sorry.
[283:47.01]If I did, I didn't mean to.
[283:49.57]Is there a take all button?
[284:02.59]What just happened to that?
[284:06.31]Yes, there is.
[284:06.87]Blueberries are ready.
[284:28.65]So now what can I do with the blueberries?
[284:29.93]I can make like a blueberry blueberry flavored ale.
[284:34.15]Blueberry ale.
[284:36.61]Yep.
[284:38.39]Well, I'm going to do blueberry raspberry wheat beer.
[284:47.59]Blueberry mead.
[284:48.71]Blueberry mead.
[284:49.31]Alright, let's try a blueberry mead.
[284:55.83]What about like a banana wheat beer?
[284:57.87]That's weird.
[285:00.85]Oh, I need water.
[285:05.66]Why does it... Hold on.
[285:06.70]Has anybody ever made a banana beer before?
[285:10.14]I feel like I would like it.
[285:15.41]Banana beer?
[285:17.43]That sounds actually kind of good.
[285:23.80]Banana beer is amazing.
[285:27.71]I wonder if I can track some down somewhere.
[285:30.27]That actually sounds good.
[285:34.33]Alright, wheat.
[285:38.23]Need fuel.
[285:42.07]I need to make a second one of these.
[285:43.13]Alright, we can do a mild ale.
[285:52.28]So this is just ale yeast.
[285:55.08]And let's throw some fucking blueberries in there.
[285:59.12]Blueberries with some aroma.
[286:03.53]And dual hops.
[286:04.59]There we go.
[286:07.75]That was so loud.
[286:11.87]Oh, wait.
[286:12.09]What about a blueberry porridge with corn and hints of rye flavoring?
[286:30.68]Another wheat beer.
[286:32.88]That was a shotgun.
[286:35.98]It was.
[286:36.46]I'm sorry.
[286:39.34]Alright, the next day that we do this... Look at this.
[286:43.59]I'm gonna have like three or four different taps.
[286:54.24]Pies.
[286:58.41]Five, three, four to make pies.
[287:01.03]I want to make like blueberry pie and stuff.
[287:06.53]Jam.
[287:07.23]Shit.
[287:07.47]I can make bread.
[287:14.04]Alright, I'm overwhelming myself.
[287:15.54]What am I doing?
[287:16.84]Tea?
[287:20.18]I want pie.
[287:21.10]We're going for pie.
[287:23.88]We're probably not even going to get there.
[287:34.38]Make apple pie.
[287:35.16]I have a lot of wheat.
[287:37.74]I probably make bread.
[287:38.44]Uh, what do I need to make bread?
[287:46.25]I already can.
[287:53.65]I can make sausages.
[287:56.43]Corn blueberry sausage?
[287:58.33]What?
[288:01.35]What?
[288:10.68]Orange sausage?
[288:11.92]I don't know if that's... Gonna be any good, but... Whatever, they're gonna eat it.
[288:25.59]Bro, what the fuck?
[288:26.77]What?
[288:30.89]Hey, if it's available, I'm putting it on the menu, alright?
[288:34.24]I'm putting all this weird shit on the menu.
[288:36.62]We're making 10 gold tomorrow.
[288:56.28]The rest of the raspberries.
[288:57.16]Okay.
[289:09.81]Get a pear tree up.
[289:14.46]I'm going to make two pear trees.
[289:15.88]Hold on.
[289:18.38]I can make one here and one down here.
[289:19.46]This is four by four.
[289:40.44]Strawberry rhubarb pie sounds pretty good.
[289:42.86]It's good with ice cream.
[290:05.83]Sounds good.
[290:13.36]Better?
[290:13.62]Alright.
[290:14.08]I want two pear trees and that's it.
[290:16.16]I bought 40 of them.
[290:18.56]But I'll never have to buy them ever again.
[290:19.74]Get this rock out of the way.
[290:40.60]Can I clear this rock?
[290:41.50]Probably not.
[290:56.72]Well, it's alright.
[291:00.10]Can I even fit it here?
[291:00.82]Oh, you piece of crap.
[291:10.32]Shovel on the rock?
[291:12.93]Probably better tools, eventually.
[291:14.79]I probably can't remove it.
[291:17.31]So, we're just gonna have to be sad and go this way.
[291:45.20]I can't tell this though.
[291:54.38]Why is it so weird near the rock?
[291:55.52]What the hell?
[292:01.11]Oh my goodness.
[292:01.71]Okay, well.
[292:04.79]And it's just going up here.
[292:26.03]It doesn't have to look fine.
[292:27.31]It just has to look... It just has to produce the fruit.
[292:30.18]This is horrible.
[292:42.75]Yeah, see?
[292:46.43]I can't... There.
[292:51.75]Done.
[292:53.13]Done.
[292:55.22]Done.
[292:56.66]And then I'll put something else here.
[292:57.54]I'll put like raspberries or something.
[293:00.24]I got other stuff coming in the mail.
[293:10.35]Okay.
[293:13.99]Cool.
[293:16.39]Check on the other stuff.
[293:24.28]Cooking a lot of things.
[293:26.84]Here's the sausage.
[293:29.62]Wheatwort.
[293:31.04]Here it is.
[293:31.76]Good, good.
[293:32.36]There's the mild blueberry ale.
[293:46.23]Alright.
[293:46.77]Wheat.
[293:47.35]Lager.
[293:49.26]Blueberry.
[293:51.46]Bitter.
[293:53.74]Dual hops.
[293:57.26]I think.
[294:00.18]Whatever.
[294:07.26]All this dude has is blueberry ale.
[294:13.24]Hey, it's different and it's cool and it's unique.
[294:20.70]You know the amount of people that are going to be looking for craft beer that come in here?
[294:23.98]It's like, oh, blueberry malted pancake batter banana smoothie beer.
[294:30.13]And they're going to go, oh, they're going to take one sip and be like, but it's a craft beer.
[294:36.29]So, I mean, I think I get a little bit of points.
[294:38.07]Alright, I'm ready to start the day after this.
[294:52.73]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[294:53.35]I'm waking up.
[294:53.91]I'm gonna be fresh.
[294:54.59]And we're gonna start the day.
[295:09.19]Hello.
[295:15.95]Okay.
[295:18.91]Cool.
[295:24.10]That's all my material.
[295:25.24]So this is a mild ale, just kind of like a, just a regular, just like bud light, I guess.
[295:35.23]This one is the blueberry with aromatic properties and some extra spice in it.
[295:42.41]That's a wheat beer.
[295:43.03]And then over here we have our lager.
[295:47.41]This is a wheat lager with hints of blueberry, bitter, with some extra spices on it.
[295:59.62]This guy thinks Bud Light is an ale.
[296:01.16]I don't drink that much beer, guys.
[296:17.31]Raspberries are done too?
[296:18.17]Alright, I'm gonna do a raspberry strawberry rye beer.
[296:47.59]Alright, what about a strawberry, raspberry, corn porridge?
[296:59.55]Oh wait, can I not do that?
[297:00.47]Oh, I need fuel.
[297:01.69]No, I don't.
[297:01.97]Wait, what?
[297:02.31]This restaurant is disgusting.
[297:29.79]corn blueberry sausage blueberry corn soup corn wheat soup or corn starch seeds we got blueberry corn soup blueberry corn sausages blueberry corn beer we've got everything is blueberry I think it's gonna be alright
[298:03.44]I need to get butter.
[298:05.41]Why can't I put butter in any of this?
[298:21.16]Can I just have people eat the strawberries?
[298:25.26]No.
[298:30.25]Dude, apple seeds are toxic.
[298:33.36]I think it's gonna be alright.
[298:49.95]Raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, sausage.
[298:51.95]I mean, this is just a fruit roll-up.
[298:55.17]What even?
[298:55.51]This is just like fruit pectin, right?
[299:02.69]Alright, I'm ready to open this door.
[299:06.81]I got what I want.
[299:09.61]Wait.
[299:12.06]Didn't have an extra table.
[299:13.20]I'm getting another table.
[299:14.18]No, I'm not.
[299:14.68]Who cares?
[299:15.26]Yeah.
[299:16.48]I'm getting one more table.
[299:18.36]And then I'm done.
[299:19.04]And I will open this door, I promise.
[299:20.60]I just need a bunch of wooden planks.
[299:44.64]I want two more tables.
[299:45.58]Blueberry corn muffin sounds pretty good.
[299:53.75]Yeah.
[300:01.97]Fence the farm up so nobody sees this atrocity.
[300:15.28]Anyway, it's mine.
[300:19.16]My strawberries.
[300:21.12]What are you looking at?
[300:27.60]What do you want?
[300:42.26]Small table.
[300:45.19]And then we need four benches, right?
[300:48.32]I just need a ton of everything.
[301:20.85]Is this game better than Stardew Valley?
[301:24.73]I mean, but you can't... You're comparing something to the Mona Lisa.
[301:32.85]It's kind of hard to do that.
[301:44.35]I think it's fun.
[301:44.85]I mean, obviously I'm still playing it for five hours.
[301:47.39]I've been having a good time.
[301:48.49]It scratches that sort of make stuff, collect stuff, sell stuff.
[301:53.59]I'm having a good time.
[301:57.30]It's not the Mona Lisa, but I mean, how do you do that?
[302:00.78]How do you compare something to the Mona Lisa?
[302:03.44]I just don't think you can.
[302:26.82]The main lasso.
[302:28.32]I know.
[302:32.09]Bro, the Mona Lisa sucks.
[302:37.33]Alright, art critic Andy.
[302:40.25]That's... Alright.
[302:46.30]Mona Lisa's overrated.
[302:53.17]Yeah, but still, it's one of the most important paintings in human history, right?
[302:59.37]We all kind of say that.
[303:00.59]We all agree with that.
[303:09.91]We don't agree.
[303:10.71]Okay, well, what are the most important paintings in human history?
[303:19.13]There's probably a few dozen I could probably think of.
[303:26.60]Uh, let us not forget Socrates drinking the poison!
[303:29.61]Sorry, that was probably loud.
[303:31.83]People sleeping.
[303:44.90]Socrates, when he knows they've called for his execution, and he's got that finger pointing up, and he's like, I will drink this potion because I know it will kill me, therefore I have my philosophy.
[303:56.64]Like, that finger pointing up, and everyone's like, what the fuck?
[304:00.62]That painting goes hard.
[304:07.33]What is the name of that painting?
[304:09.37]Socrates' execution, right?
[304:12.85]Socrates' demise?
[304:14.41]What's that painting called?
[304:17.63]The Death of Socrates, yep.
[304:20.75]I think that's a pretty important one.
[304:37.27]Creation of Adam?
[304:46.05]The death of Socrates, yeah.
[304:49.99]Um, actually, that painting isn't even good.
[304:51.29]It's only famous because Socrates died.
[304:52.91]Yeah, but Socrates and Plato, I mean, those people, those were incredibly important people in our history.
[305:13.24]Plato.
[305:19.18]Guys, Socrates invented soup.
[305:23.73]So, what do you got to say?
[305:48.44]Can't a lot of the like modern philosophy be tied back to what Plato and Socrates were doing?
[306:01.05]Yeah, come on.
[306:10.83]I need to make two more benches.
[306:29.14]Socrates invented critical thinking.
[306:31.65]No, was it Socrates that invented the scientific theory, whatever it is?
[306:38.37]One of them did.
[306:41.43]No, no, no, no, they did.
[306:44.67]The scientific method was Socrates, wasn't it?
[306:59.55]Who came up with it?
[307:05.65]Galileo.
[307:06.49]Alright, but yeah, but whatever, right?
[307:08.47]Gala- Galileo did.
[307:13.14]Aristotle.
[307:14.04]Galileo.
[307:15.12]These people are important.
[307:15.90]Socrates.
[307:16.92]Plato.
[307:21.44]Ben Franklin.
[307:25.86]I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[307:27.06]I'm not starting that up at fucking midnight.
[307:29.04]I'm not starting that up at midnight.
[307:30.21]I mean, all of them are in hell, but you know.
[307:49.76]Did somebody just say all scientists are in hell?
[307:52.85]Bro, you need to fucking relax.
[307:56.91]You need to relax.
[307:58.71]Is that what you said?
[307:59.61]What the hell?
[308:13.12]Oh, that's... That's funny.
[308:16.79]Every single one.
[308:27.85]What did you say?
[308:28.57]Can you just get your stupid Boston ass together, you fuck?
[308:34.33]Jesus Christ, you're like the worst Red Sox fan.
[308:42.56]What are you doing?
[308:43.32]Leave me alone.
[308:45.18]What the hell?
[308:57.05]I just imagine some Boston fan just pissed.
[309:01.29]He didn't even fucking talk about the fucking trade that happened.
[309:05.83]Does he not understand the fucking Patriots season coming up this year?
[309:08.86]Is he not fucking paying attention?
[309:11.36]God, fuck this guy.
[309:15.32]Why are you not talking about the management?
[309:18.00]General manager.
[309:20.76]He didn't even say the Red Sox.
[309:21.67]He didn't talk about the fucking Red Sox.
[309:32.90]I've been here for over an hour.
[309:33.92]I thought you were from Boston.
[309:38.78]Fake fucking fan.
[309:43.45]Where's this Grotto Beasts shit?
[309:46.99]Grotto Beasts?
[309:48.93]You fucking loser.
[309:58.98]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[310:02.16]Come on.
[310:08.03]Grotto Beasts.
[310:08.63]What fucking minor league team is that?
[310:12.34]What town do they play for?
[310:13.24]I've never heard of the fucking Grotto Beasts.
[310:17.96]Red Sox would destroy them, though.
[310:19.16]That's all I know.
[310:19.76]Alright, I'm ready to start the day.
[310:29.93]Let's put the benches in.
[310:35.87]I've got a lot of stuff now.
[310:37.31]This is going to be a crazy day.
[310:39.79]This place is too small.
[311:29.28]Gonna have to be a little more cramped, I think.
[311:33.06]Need the benches.
[311:59.26]Okay.
[312:01.15]Uh, this now needs to move.
[312:02.63]I don't know.
[312:05.55]Here, probably.
[312:06.09]Alright, I'm gonna move this.
[312:15.86]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[312:16.56]What's going on?
[312:37.21]The fuck?
[313:38.77]That can stay over here.
[313:39.55]Where's your depth perception?
[313:51.60]I'm just looking at stuff.
[313:53.04]I'm just looking at stuff!
[314:02.49]I want the big table where the fire is.
[314:06.09]That thing costs extra.
[314:42.37]sitting on this side.
[314:45.07]Ah, this seat sucks.
[314:53.90]Alright, I need to buy one more bench.
[315:02.42]Didn't I make a third one?
[315:06.19]Shit, I didn't.
[315:06.75]Okay, wait, do I have a third one in my inventory?
[315:08.77]No, I need one more.
[315:28.83]Do you make the restaurant in the game?
[315:31.26]You make the... It's limited to the point of... You make beer.
[315:37.24]You can add flavors to the beer.
[315:38.70]Different fruits and different... Wheat and barley and... You technically do make the menu.
[315:45.18]I need to go fishing or something.
[315:48.52]I don't know.
[315:53.84]Make the tables vertical?
[315:56.90]If I make all the tables vertical...
[316:01.16]Then I won't be able to see all their smiling faces.
[316:05.88]At least for the people facing this way.
[316:07.10]Come on.
[316:31.47]Okay.
[316:32.49]It's time to go to bed and then open the store.
[316:35.59]I'm ready.
[316:35.93]This is going to be the biggest day so far.
[316:52.00]Big day.
[317:20.09]ready or no it's you take the raspberries and you can make a raspberry beer or maybe eventually whiskey vodka moonshine I don't know what their plans are game is still in early access so I don't know take a raspberry corn sausage yep you can do that too
[317:59.11]I think I want this just because I have a lot of firewood.
[318:13.94]I like the footsteps.
[318:14.78]It's nice.
[318:30.49]How big is the area?
[318:32.99]As of right this moment in early access, I don't know if they're planning on adding a full town or anything, but it looks like there's an up.
[318:42.28]There's a down.
[318:43.30]I think there is a... They keep talking about a mine.
[318:48.84]I don't know if it's up here.
[318:55.79]What's up here?
[319:07.75]This is blocked off currently.
[319:36.73]amusing me so much when you stand completely still while reading chat I can't multitask either well I let's put it this way if I'm walking and I look away from the screen I'm not seeing where I'm going so I can't really you know if I'm looking over here and walk I don't know where I'm walking especially when a game you need to have a lot of attention problems anyways
[320:07.30]I need to stop to read.
[320:11.88]This is a bridge.
[320:12.58]I bet you have to put a certain amount of wood or money to make the bridge go.
[320:21.03]It looks like it's planned to be here.
[320:39.26]But all that matters right now is opening the tavern.
[320:51.35]We're going to do very soon.
[320:53.85]Alright, firewood stockpile.
[321:15.64]Does it just go there?
[321:16.80]Maybe it does it automatically.
[321:17.66]Alright, let's go.
[321:20.49]Big day.
[321:37.17]A lot of customers.
[321:37.91]I need to be prepared.
[321:38.62]I got all my food in here.
[321:41.02]Cat has water.
[321:42.56]Lots of food.
[321:43.80]Tons of shit on tap.
[321:46.72]Get a little bit of everything.
[322:16.04]Oh, he ate the blueberry sausage.
[322:29.55]Are we clean?
[322:40.81]Still pretty clean.
[322:41.59]Oh, shit.
[322:42.05]I'm out of light.
[322:42.53]I think I got it.
[322:45.62]Hold on.
[323:07.53]OK.
[323:07.93]We got people in.
[323:25.56]Good choice.
[323:26.08]Blueberry raspberry sausage stew.
[323:32.49]Good choice.
[323:46.96]People seem pretty happy.
[323:50.94]Menu selection.
[323:55.49]Service here is terrible.
[324:04.70]Oh!
[324:06.02]Free sausages coming up.
[324:28.72]Saucers are flying off the shelf.
[324:31.88]People really like it.
[324:41.55]What's the thing in the bottom right mean that flower?
[324:44.01]I mean, there's not enough decorations.
[324:54.72]Means it's dirty.
[325:04.36]Gonna level up here.
[325:14.37]How much inventory do I still have?
[325:18.90]I can stay open for a long time.
[325:20.12]As long as I have the candlelight.
[325:40.74]random order quests are available at the notice board really oh my god level up oh my god did you call it the sus guy tavern LOL
[326:15.15]Yeah.
[326:22.64]Oh shit, hold on.
[326:25.60]Getting out of hand.
[326:33.25]Well, I don't.
[326:33.79]I'm only one person.
[326:34.67]Hold on.
[326:44.86]crack that person in the face while they're eating.
[326:56.21]Ugh.
[327:12.86]Is this a medieval tavern or fantasy RPG tavern?
[327:16.62]I would say medieval tavern.
[327:19.18]We haven't seen very many fantasy characters walk in.
[327:30.10]Service here is terrible.
[327:33.82]Relax, calm down, calm down, calm down.
[327:48.49]Oh shit, what do you want?
[327:59.16]The owner of this place is a cultist.
[328:00.73]Why do you keep saying that?
[328:22.09]That's pretty good.
[328:28.16]I want to go through all of the inventory.
[328:43.35]This is definitely the stage where you get a little bigger and you need someone to help.
[328:47.07]You need a staff member.
[329:00.20]Uh oh.
[329:05.00]Running out of beer.
[329:08.27]It's Gruul.
[329:09.77]Oh, shut up.
[329:17.69]Get out of here.
[329:24.77]Yeah, once we get to about midnight, that's when Gruul is on the menu.
[329:39.70]Looks like that was the most popular.
[329:46.85]That blueberry lager is the popular one.
[330:00.26]Whatever that stew is, everyone's ordering it.
[330:07.15]That one.
[330:08.85]That was the one that everyone said was poisonous.
[330:11.63]They're all ordering the apple seed one.
[330:24.54]This table is getting gross.
[330:32.02]Time for the fire.
[330:46.17]Alright, that's empty.
[330:46.93]Alright, for a second I thought this was a skeleton.
[330:55.97]Like, whose bones are over here?
[330:57.25]Oh shit, hold on.
[331:15.94]People are ordering this shitty beer now.
[331:21.58]Well, shitty relatively to my blueberry lager.
[331:39.13]And that's it.
[331:39.79]That's empty.
[331:42.41]Oh boy.
[331:46.55]How much food is left?
[331:49.32]We got a lot.
[331:50.02]I can probably stay up until I pass out.
[332:11.88]They're only ordering the one beer.
[332:13.36]That's all I have left, right?
[332:15.22]I have one more of those.
[332:16.12]Yeah, there we go.
[332:18.78]Hey, you got the last one.
[332:21.44]Good for you.
[332:34.63]Clean the throw up.
[332:38.05]I can only move so fast.
[332:39.27]I'm cleaning.
[332:59.57]Does the health department know about this place?
[333:03.17]The health department back in the old medieval times was... Hey, I found a fly in my drink.
[333:09.23]I'm going to hit the bartender with an axe.
[333:13.39]There's your health department.
[333:25.69]No, they just ate it.
[333:42.85]Yep, I can wipe it down.
[333:46.05]There you go.
[333:46.77]Enjoy your, uh, banana-encrusted raspberry-filled... fuckin' vegan sausages is what I made, I think.
[334:02.50]Hey!
[334:02.72]I got a bad review.
[334:19.34]Now it's just down to the food.
[334:20.40]Alright.
[334:21.10]Look at this 5.5 gold.
[334:34.83]This is kind of filthy over here.
[334:51.51]A food is great, but the owner won't stop talking about the Red Sox.
[334:54.09]Two out of five.
[334:55.81]Yeah.
[334:58.11]Right.
[334:59.39]And then the Red Sox guy comes in and gives me a two out of five because I didn't talk about the Red Sox enough.
[335:06.37]Understand how I cannot win here?
[335:14.66]You see?
[335:15.82]You guys understand?
[335:32.36]5.7.
[335:32.40]Alright.
[335:32.68]I'm almost out of stuff.
[335:36.26]What happens if I just serve gruel until everybody passes out?
[335:39.39]Like, is that possible?
[335:41.79]Can I just serve gruel until I go to bed?
[335:45.21]I'm very curious, but I don't want to lose all this money.
[335:47.40]It'll be bad.
[335:54.69]Oh no, we found him.
[335:56.19]We found him in the morning.
[335:57.59]Face first into a bowl of gruel.
[336:01.25]It's a gruesome sight.
[336:10.16]One man Applebee's.
[336:11.30]I like that.
[336:16.62]Alright, we're at gruel hours.
[336:20.13]It is 1am.
[336:21.11]All I have is gruel.
[336:26.16]And imagine complaining right now.
[336:27.96]You've eaten all of my food.
[336:30.54]You've eaten, you've cleaned out all of my inventory.
[336:32.79]This is what I can make right now.
[336:35.53]I really don't like the atmosphere right now.
[336:37.33]Like, well, all I have is wheat and water.
[336:39.98]All I have is rice and water.
[336:42.50]That's, that's what we have.
[336:43.88]That's what we have.
[336:55.64]Fucking him up.
[337:00.45]Yeah, how long can this actually go for?
[337:09.63]It's 2 a.m.
[337:12.35]Oh, wait, somebody's pissed.
[337:16.18]Eat the gruel.
[337:23.26]Why are they still here?
[337:34.41]I mean, at what point am I just taking what everybody has left on their plates and just mixing them together and putting it on another plate?
[337:55.32]I don't have any more ingredients.
[338:13.40]Should I kick?
[338:13.92]Should I?
[338:14.20]Is that it?
[338:14.54]Alright, everybody get out.
[338:16.02]Alright, one more gruel for the road.
[338:20.08]There you go.
[338:21.46]All of you eating gruel.
[338:22.79]Now get out.
[338:38.35]Did somebody punch me?
[338:50.97]Oh no, it's a mess.
[338:53.21]Now I passed out.
[338:53.89]I heard like a... I heard this place has super good gruel.
[338:59.17]I just need like people on Instagram to talk about it.
[339:03.34]Guys, I went to this restaurant yesterday and they had the best gruel I've ever had.
[339:09.76]It was super fruity and it had hints of raspberries.
[339:24.50]You guys are not going to believe this spot that I found.
[339:26.54]Should I sleep?
[339:34.00]Secret menu.
[339:43.13]The vibes were amazing.
[339:45.01]And I think that's probably where we're going to call it.
[339:46.61]Right exactly at midnight exactly.
[339:50.02]Exactly at 12 a.m.
[340:02.41]8 a.m where were you Europe good morning to you yeah we'll call it here this is fun uh I don't know if I will continue to play this but it was that was really fun it was really cute I liked it I think there's probably a lot more to do but it's pretty cool it's called traveler's rest pretty comfy
[340:35.28]Wait, I... Ooh, hold on.
[340:38.74]One apple off of this whole tree.
[340:46.74]One singular apple per tree?
[340:48.60]That does not seem very sustainable.
[340:54.39]That seems kind of... One?
[340:56.47]One?
[341:06.57]Alright.
[341:08.75]That's it.
[341:10.87]I'll see you guys later.
[341:11.59]I'll probably see you guys on... I'll see you probably on... Monday?
[341:16.82]I'll see you guys Monday.
[341:19.48]Monday or Tuesday.
[341:20.38]Again, the sus is going to be more of a general guideline.
[341:24.04]I don't want to do like reverse delays and delays.
[341:26.40]So there will not be a stream until early this week.
[341:30.03]Somewhere around Monday or Tuesday.
[341:31.55]Keep an eye on the sus.
[341:33.07]I will change it when I know for certain exactly when it's going to happen.
[341:36.65]We'll see.
[341:37.27]I'd say expect a stream early this coming week.
[341:40.58]That sounds good, right?
[341:45.27]And again, to touch upon the Grotto Beasts stuff one more time, we are exploring a digital version of the game.
[341:54.54]I can kind of just maybe just parrot one more time what that means.
[342:02.16]We're exploring it.
[342:03.20]It's being investigated right now.
[342:04.46]We're trying to find a good way to do it.
[342:06.46]And whether it is a mod or an existing platform, or it is something standalone,
[342:14.80]We are going to try, because the... Make sure I get all this information correct.
[342:20.82]The channel merch that is Grotto Beasts has a game on it.
[342:25.42]There is a trading card game on this merch.
[342:29.54]And we're very aware that there's a lot of people that either can't afford it, or that don't really... They want to participate in the game, maybe.
[342:37.70]They don't want to collect the merch.
[342:39.67]So we're probably going to do some form of a digital release that we can be in control of.
[342:47.24]And they're absolutely one thing.
[342:49.26]We want to get this right, because I don't want to screw this up anyway.
[342:52.75]But this would not be a digital card pack opening version of Grotto Beasts.
[342:58.25]It would just be the game that you can play.
[343:01.21]And it would not be any additional purchases after getting it.
[343:06.30]And we don't know what that means.
[343:07.50]We just know that we're not turning this into a, oh yeah, go get the digital version and spend a shitload of money on digital card packs.
[343:13.84]That's not the point.
[343:18.41]The point is to just try to let as many people participate that want to.
[343:28.18]Because, I mean, obviously, it's an expensive piece of merch.
[343:35.17]And we've seen people be, you know, obviously say, the game, what's the game?
[343:39.47]The game seems kind of interesting.
[343:40.53]What is that?
[343:42.03]Which the rules will be posted.
[343:44.11]That's actually being written up right now.
[343:46.11]The website version of this, by the way, the rules have been written, they've been written, they've been up for a long time.
[343:51.47]I keep saying that wrong, and it's my own fault.
[343:54.66]But the rules, the game is completed, it's just we need to post the rules.
[343:58.02]The rules on the website is currently being worked on.
[344:02.06]But,
[344:04.22]I want people to participate.
[344:05.60]I want you to be able to check it out.
[344:08.17]And we want to make sure that the merch is valuable as merch to the community.
[344:15.20]But I also want to make sure that we
[344:17.87]Whether it's a mod of something or it's something that we don't want it to be a huge money sink.
[344:23.10]We just want it to be available for people just to play with other people.
[344:27.26]It's important.
[344:29.26]Whatever that means, you will know.
[344:30.63]We will tell you very, very soon.
[344:32.89]I'm hoping in the next couple of weeks we'll have a really clear answer.
[344:35.33]It would be fun if it's electronic, too.
[344:46.64]yeah we want to make sure that there's still the value of the merch because obviously it's it's a lot of money it is so I want to make sure that that stays as like cool community merch there's also an opportunity to actually play the game I hope people understand that
[345:10.15]And there's a lot of other things to talk about, but trust me when I say we're trying to make this as good and cool as we can.
[345:23.31]Without, again, I don't want the digital version to be anything more than, hey, you want to check out the game?
[345:32.30]Cool.
[345:33.20]Here it is.
[345:34.72]Whatever that means.
[345:37.28]Take care of yourselves.
[345:39.64]Just want to reiterate that one more time.
[345:52.10]A one-time purchase or something would be cool.
[345:54.07]Yeah, but that's what we want to do.
[345:57.67]I don't know the exact things we want.
[346:00.47]We've been talking internally about this for a little bit longer than you might think.
[346:04.99]Of just, what do we do?
[346:21.39]What about online matchmaking?
[346:24.92]Yeah, we're... I don't want to... I don't want to count the chickens before they're hatching here.
[346:31.78]Just be aware it's going to be some form of official digital version of this game that will have official support on it.
[346:41.17]That we will just be releasing.
[346:42.49]That will just have everything in it.
[346:46.85]So people can enjoy the game.
[346:50.08]We need to figure out exactly what that means.
[346:57.37]Why do you like Applebee's?
[347:03.13]Because it's.
[347:06.23]We need to give you a reason.
[347:15.11]He's going to do online microtransactions.
[347:18.65]No.
[347:20.11]No, that is not happening.
[347:22.21]No.
[347:23.40]The answer to that question is no.
[347:32.24]Oh my god, not again.
[347:33.22]I just got back.
[347:48.41]Do you... Whatever.
[347:54.01]Unlocking cards, maybe, by winning games.
[348:00.37]Yeah, it needs to be... It needs to be an accessory to the merch.
[348:08.10]Right?
[348:08.50]It needs to be something that is not... Because I'm not... I don't want to have people pay a bunch of money again if they already own it.
[348:19.90]Trying to be- trying to just keep my brain grounded on this stuff.
[348:32.45]And any- whether it's a mod of an existing platform?
[348:37.39]Or something else?
[348:41.36]It will be available, I can promise and guarantee you that.
[348:45.58]It will be available.
[348:54.94]Yeah, I've seen all the theories and all the people.
[348:57.76]We're exploring pretty much every option.
[349:01.19]Yep.
[349:02.49]We are exploring corporate speak.
[349:07.35]We are exploring our options.
[349:09.21]We will give you an update soon.
[349:10.95]Just know that it will exist.
[349:12.79]There you go.
[349:17.51]And we'll see you in a day.
[349:19.33]See you guys on Monday.
[349:21.31]Have a good night.
[349:25.04]Have a great rest of your evening or morning.
[349:27.44]Good morning to you.
[349:36.35]That was fun.
[349:39.19]I respect that you're not promising too much.
[349:43.41]There's already been a lot of time that's gone into this.
[349:46.53]And a lot of thought.
[349:49.23]So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.
[349:51.28]I don't want to tell you guys something that's not going to happen.
[349:56.39]That's what we've been kind of the last, I want to say, four or five days, been really trying to trickle out info that's correct.
[350:07.92]But the rules will be available for you to look at.
[350:12.38]We're hoping the next day or so.
[350:14.10]As well as the FAQ would be posted on the website.
