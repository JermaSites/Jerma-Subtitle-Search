[02:17.49]Oh.
[02:17.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I, I, wait, it's proximity, I can hear you.
[02:23.93]I have to find out where you are.
[02:25.55]Where are you?
[02:29.70]Stunning.
[02:31.50]I have no idea what's going on.
[02:34.12]Oh, I tabbed out and I died.
[02:36.40]I think.
[02:38.84]There's no audio.
[02:39.56]There's audio?
[02:43.13]You can hear that.
[02:46.55]How do you guys not hear that?
[02:47.39]Turn it up.
[02:52.13]What was that?
[02:58.73]You can hear that just fine.
[03:01.91]Can you hear me right now?
[03:03.65]I can hear you, yeah.
[03:05.09]Okay, okay, cool.
[03:06.25]I think I died.
[03:07.01]You guys can resuscitate me if you guys get the defibrillator thing.
[03:09.97]Sorry, yeah, I got distracted by several ghosts running around.
[03:13.34]Yeah, I alt-tabbed to start capture and... You got murdered?
[03:17.30]I got murdered.
[03:17.90]Okay, I got you.
[03:21.08]This game is fun.
[03:23.62]I'm liking it so far.
[03:24.60]Oh, you're all screwed.
[03:27.46]Killer plant behind you.
[03:30.28]Holy shit.
[03:30.67]Oh, I'm back.
[03:32.81]I got a guy behind.
[03:36.33]I don't know what I'm doing.
[03:38.69]I'm knocked out.
[03:40.03]Neither do I. Am I shooting teammates?
[03:43.72]What's happening?
[03:45.42]It's too hot.
[03:47.60]Turn it up.
[03:51.74]volume up.
[03:53.06]I can't quite hear you that well.
[03:56.56]Can you turn it up?
[03:57.20]This SMG is awful.
[04:03.69]I don't have time, Ross.
[04:04.39]I'm sorry.
[04:05.43]No, you're all good, man.
[04:06.77]Okay, are we good?
[04:07.65]Yeah.
[04:09.75]Good try.
[04:11.87]That's better.
[04:14.35]Okay, alright.
[04:15.76]That was a cool little warm-up.
[04:17.54]It's alright.
[04:18.00]Yeah.
[04:19.56]Now I understand how the game works.
[04:21.38]Alright.
[04:21.66]So we got Vinny.
[04:22.20]We got Criken.
[04:23.14]We got Ross.
[04:23.90]We got other people.
[04:25.40]I'm going to end this lobby.
[04:27.16]Hop back into the call.
[04:28.40]We'll get started.
[04:29.44]And then we'll hop into a new one.
[04:33.28]Sounds good.
[04:33.86]Okay.
[04:34.45]Sounds good.
[04:35.73]Alright.
[04:35.93]So that was the warm-up.
[04:36.61]We're just going to do a little introduction here.
[04:38.39]This is not Elden Ring.
[04:39.49]No, it's not.
[04:39.87]Okay.
[04:46.11]So we're going to jump into the lobby.
[04:50.15]Remember your streaming?
[04:51.01]Oh, yeah.
[04:52.55]Oh, I want to go over quickly.
[04:53.63]Really quickly.
[04:56.35]Quick before I have to get in the server.
[04:59.42]Oh, right.
[05:00.34]So tomorrow, the idea was I was going to do DOS games tomorrow.
[05:04.52]We're changing that.
[05:06.68]Wrestling Empire got a huge update.
[05:09.88]And we're going to play it.
[05:11.60]I want a little bit more time to curate the DOS stuff.
[05:14.50]We'll do DOS this weekend.
[05:16.98]Wrestling Empire tomorrow.
[05:18.94]There apparently was an unbelievably hilarious update.
[05:22.32]I have to play it, so that's what we're doing tomorrow.
[05:26.12]Oh, he's in the same, uh, let me just confirm.
[05:28.98]Same code?
[05:31.14]So this game is kind of like Prop Hunt, but it's like Left 4 Dead and Prop Hunt combined.
[05:37.55]Seems like fun.
[05:38.97]I did the tutorial, we're just trying to do audio testing to make sure it works.
[05:43.19]This game sucks.
[05:47.78]We have eight minutes in the game.
[05:49.92]Can we relax for a second, please?
[05:53.24]Can we just relax for a moment, please?
[05:56.72]You've seen like us audio testing.
[06:04.07]We haven't even played it yet.
[06:05.29]Okay, let me check.
[06:07.69]Is this the same code?
[06:17.33]I think we're doing a different code.
[06:19.51]Why are you so tense?
[06:21.47]I'm good.
[06:23.99]This game is worse than Elden Ring.
[06:25.27]Well, not every game can be Elden Ring.
[06:26.63]I'm sorry.
[06:30.08]Okay.
[06:30.84]Got a new code.
[06:34.96]Yeah, this is... I was going to just wait to stream tomorrow.
[06:40.00]But, yeah, we're here.
[06:41.04]It's good to see this group again.
[06:44.70]Vinny, Criken, these guys.
[06:45.60]It's been a long time since I played with Criken.
[06:48.67]Or Vinny.
[06:49.47]Or Ross.
[06:50.07]It's been a while.
[06:50.47]Alright, here we go.
[06:57.98]I like how the game actually has like a lobby system though.
[07:01.10]So we don't have to have like 10 people at each other on Steam.
[07:04.70]Which can always kind of be a pain in the ass.
[07:10.78]Okay.
[07:11.98]Did that work?
[07:13.54]It worked.
[07:13.84]Okay.
[07:14.50]Alright.
[07:17.21]You guys ready?
[07:20.13]How come you're so tense?
[07:21.27]I'm a tense person.
[07:25.01]I went in for a massage, like, the other day.
[07:28.27]And the person could not need.
[07:30.42]They couldn't.
[07:31.50]It was like a brick.
[07:33.76]They were like, alright, that's, like, funny.
[07:34.94]Take off, like, the cement jacket.
[07:36.44]And I was like, what are you talking about?
[07:38.24]My mic is off?
[07:38.98]What?
[07:43.26]No, we're good.
[07:43.86]I just want to make sure that the lobby code's not here.
[07:46.31]It's not.
[07:46.63]Alright, I can put it up.
[07:50.40]Can you hear me?
[07:52.53]I feel like that's been the whole stream so far for like the first 10 minutes.
[07:55.51]It's like, hey dude, can you hear me?
[07:57.41]Can you hear me?
[07:58.85]Alright, so I'm on the hunter team.
[08:02.11]Our goal is to hunt the ghost just like prop hunt.
[08:04.41]People can hide in chairs and curtains and all that shit.
[08:10.41]He's too tense.
[08:17.84]Yeah.
[08:18.34]No, I'm a very tense person.
[08:23.24]You're my favorite.
[08:24.80]Thank you.
[08:28.80]This seems fun.
[08:29.48]It does seem fun.
[08:29.99]Let's try it.
[08:33.69]Waiting for players.
[08:34.29]So, it looks like... What do we got in this team?
[08:37.19]Vinny, Liam... She says... I'm sorry.
[08:42.73]Alright.
[08:43.63]This is a good team.
[08:45.76]This is a good team.
[08:49.24]You should start doing yoga.
[08:49.90]Yoga?
[08:51.74]No, yoga freaks me out.
[08:54.21]Because I get even more tense in yoga because I know I can't do the moves.
[08:58.91]And it's embarrassing.
[09:05.19]It's like, oh, put your leg over here and put your head over this way and raise your arm and leg up and I can't do it and I just end up sitting on the pad like this until the next move.
[09:17.48]I'm just like, I don't want to do it.
[09:19.66]I can do the really easy ones.
[09:23.01]Why would I even pay to do yoga?
[09:25.53]With, like, a yoga instructor.
[09:27.18]If there's three moves that I can do.
[09:30.20]I could just do those here.
[09:32.68]And save whatever X amount of dollars it is to go do yoga.
[09:38.22]You're inflexible?
[09:39.71]Well, yeah.
[09:40.13]The last, like, two or three years, yeah.
[09:44.95]Spamming ResidentSleepers.
[09:46.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:47.53]Okay.
[09:51.84]Oh, load up!
[09:53.64]right so I want to use I don't have any money so it doesn't matter vacuum once a ghost is dead you suck them up I'll just start I'm just gonna go with whatever I need alright let's do it alright what do you say uh what do you say guys uh there's nobody here oh hello ready to catch some ghosts uh hi team uh we're I think we're only doing c sorry this is q
[10:23.35]Oh, you need to do loadout and then you come in.
[10:30.07]Yeah.
[10:30.31]DMCA, I'm scared.
[10:33.27]Oh, was that... No, don't worry.
[10:35.57]I don't think this is DMCA.
[10:36.95]I'm sure it's fine.
[10:37.79]No, yes it is.
[10:38.35]Yes it is.
[10:38.87]Yes it is.
[10:39.51]Okay.
[10:40.99]Audio jungle.
[10:41.57]It is?
[10:42.95]No, I'm just messing around.
[10:47.13]This reminds me of the DMC-5 van.
[10:51.71]What is going on?
[10:52.27]Oh, yeah.
[10:53.84]Vin, where is the beeping?
[10:55.18]Uh, no, not, oh.
[10:56.80]So, Jerma, do you remember the beeping when we last hunted ghosts?
[11:00.66]I do.
[11:01.28]What, did you figure out what it was?
[11:02.36]Yeah, it was a, it's a faulty headset that I ended up EQing out.
[11:08.16]It's a long story, but it is.
[11:09.64]But you actually had a broken headset?
[11:13.12]My VR headset was broken and came with bleeps.
[11:16.58]Oh, that was, that's weird that it did you, you're echoey now.
[11:19.59]That was weird.
[11:22.13]If we're doing proximity, I think it's ambiance.
[11:25.94]Every time you turn your head, I stop being able to hear you well.
[11:29.04]Like, it's just... We have to face each other when we talk.
[11:32.28]Yeah, we have to face each other when we talk.
[11:34.84]Look at me in the eye.
[11:37.71]What do you spin while holding down a note?
[11:39.79]We have to make eye contact.
[11:43.41]Alright, let's do this.
[11:45.83]Let us hunt well.
[11:46.81]We have to be so close.
[11:50.46]Alright.
[11:52.63]It's the rat.
[11:53.97]Remember your buddy's system.
[11:55.17]It's the Tyrannosaurus!
[11:58.97]It's the deer.
[12:02.97]So wait, should we not shoot anything?
[12:04.88]Is there a downfall to do that?
[12:07.82]There doesn't seem to be a penalty to... You know, we can hit whatever we want.
[12:12.50]Like, I'm going to hit Jupiter right now.
[12:13.98]Because fuck Jupiter.
[12:16.96]Some planet's in here.
[12:18.41]There might be a planet.
[12:19.11]Oh!
[12:24.60]There's definitely a ghost.
[12:25.76]If you're a ghost, say hi.
[12:29.72]Ah, guys.
[12:30.88]I don't think they're fucking in here.
[12:33.84]I was doing global.
[12:40.01]Are we supposed to be doing global chat?
[12:45.25]I don't like that.
[12:46.07]We agreed we're going to do only global to start.
[12:48.35]And if it sucks, we don't do it anymore.
[12:50.07]Oh, okay.
[12:51.15]I get you.
[12:51.57]I've been doing proximity the whole time.
[12:54.51]Okay.
[12:54.79]Let's... Yeah.
[12:55.51]Well, I... Sorry.
[12:56.11]Yes.
[12:56.29]Proximity will be doing.
[12:57.25]Yes.
[12:57.89]I think it's more fun that way.
[12:58.81]That's in a weird space.
[12:59.87]That's in a weird place right there.
[13:02.93]Oh!
[13:03.19]Oh!
[13:03.41]Ghost!
[13:03.77]Here.
[13:04.47]Where?
[13:05.67]Where'd he go?
[13:06.47]Where'd he go?
[13:07.49]What?
[13:07.63]Who was it?
[13:08.34]What was it?
[13:09.84]I don't know.
[13:10.80]But it was... It was this thing.
[13:12.60]He's gone.
[13:13.86]There's another duck.
[13:14.74]Yo.
[13:15.36]I just like duck.
[13:16.24]No.
[13:16.44]Whoa!
[13:16.88]Whoa!
[13:17.38]Did I not have shot the duck?
[13:20.36]I like... I like them.
[13:22.46]What happened?
[13:22.80]Was that... Was that a ghost?
[13:25.44]I think that's a glitch.
[13:27.13]Oh, okay.
[13:28.65]That's a video game ghost, technically.
[13:30.91]Yeah.
[13:35.21]I can't wait to be the ghost.
[13:38.71]Oh, shit.
[13:39.47]I'm going to go down ground floor.
[13:42.95]What's up?
[13:47.16]Oh, I think Vinny... Where are they?
[13:50.16]They're reading in this room.
[13:52.40]Oh, that's right.
[13:52.90]We have a reader.
[13:54.10]I forgot about that.
[13:56.65]How do you pull up the reader?
[13:57.29]Uh, you gotta have it in your inventory and it's pressing number two in the key.
[14:03.39]Oh, shit.
[14:03.61]Okay.
[14:04.79]There was a copy of Jerma.
[14:07.00]Oh, I thought that was just a bug.
[14:09.62]What was it?
[14:10.00]Oh, there's somebody right here.
[14:11.52]Right here.
[14:12.10]It was fucking Ross.
[14:13.38]Ross Ghost.
[14:15.12]What?
[14:15.54]What?
[14:16.42]Who's he standing still?
[14:17.62]Can anyone vacuum?
[14:18.14]Anybody got a vacuum?
[14:18.88]I have a defib.
[14:19.87]I got a vacuum.
[14:20.65]Here, I'll...
[14:21.71]okay great nice why would you just stand in there did he see I think he's he didn't know I heard him though see since we're all doing uh proximity oh god yeah proximity is global so if since we're all pressing the c button we give each other's positions away oh it's kind of fun though
[14:51.42]Oh!
[14:52.82]How are you shooting me?
[14:54.94]I'm just friendly spaceman.
[15:00.10]Nothing personal, Jelly.
[15:01.82]I was so focused on the reader that I didn't notice you guys were shooting a spaceman.
[15:06.79]It's literally one minute to midnight.
[15:07.95]What does that mean?
[15:10.09]What does that mean?
[15:10.93]That's the witching hour.
[15:13.51]They can kill us at midnight.
[15:14.53]Alright.
[15:14.81]Even if we sucked up into a vacuum can come back and still kill us.
[15:19.20]But they're weakened.
[15:20.87]I got a defib so I can... Oh, well.
[15:23.24]I shouldn't have said that because then they'll single me out.
[15:26.12]Does anyone need help?
[15:26.96]I have a health kit.
[15:29.28]I think... I think we're pretty good.
[15:31.04]There's only... What?
[15:31.86]Two more?
[15:32.20]I'm going up.
[15:37.74]Oh, yeah.
[15:38.34]Oh, yeah.
[15:38.80]One of these pots?
[15:39.94]Okay.
[15:43.54]Eh.
[15:43.78]No.
[15:43.86]That's what I would do.
[15:45.80]Really?
[15:46.06]I would have gone to one of those pots.
[15:53.20]So in 17 seconds, they're going to attack us.
[15:58.65]Don't they build up a negative attribute if they stay still?
[16:03.93]Yeah, Jerma, they build up ectoplasm, and then they become more easily discoverable if they stay still.
[16:16.01]We should probably stick... Actually, maybe not stick together, because then they'll kill us easier in groups.
[16:20.27]Yeah, we should...
[16:24.00]Oh, my God.
[16:24.78]That was fast.
[16:26.80]Why is this?
[16:27.67]What is the mammoth?
[16:36.37]Oh, my God.
[16:39.30]Nice.
[16:39.72]Nice.
[16:39.94]Ross got away.
[16:40.62]Ross.
[16:41.18]There he is.
[16:42.74]I think.
[16:43.42]Nope.
[16:43.66]Nope.
[16:43.78]That's a different guy.
[16:44.96]It's Jolly.
[16:50.54]God damn it.
[16:52.67]Plant.
[17:09.39]We do it?
[17:11.95]One left?
[17:12.39]Plant, plant, plant.
[17:13.07]Oh, yes!
[17:13.29]Sorry, I just got way too excited.
[17:15.43]My heart's beating.
[17:33.18]Oh, look at us.
[17:34.10]So cool.
[17:34.60]In our identical poses.
[17:36.22]Oh, man.
[17:37.22]We look like bootleg Pyro.
[17:40.58]It's like a flash mob.
[17:41.68]Imagine being that excited.
[17:46.04]That excited over the first game.
[17:52.04]You suck.
[17:52.86]It's the first game.
[17:53.76]Relax.
[17:55.57]Alright.
[17:56.53]Let's keep this team one more time, and then we'll find out how to shuffle.
[18:00.73]Sure.
[18:02.07]Also remember when you're a ghost, if you need to leave.
[18:04.33]That was very important info that we did not just get.
[18:08.38]That was, sounded important.
[18:13.79]Alright.
[18:13.99]What do we got?
[18:14.39]Phantom.
[18:17.29]Spirit.
[18:18.31]I think I like this one.
[18:20.06]This one.
[18:21.94]Chill.
[18:23.26]See hunters through walls.
[18:24.10]Sure.
[18:26.20]Okay.
[18:26.46]Cool.
[18:28.34]What should I go in?
[18:28.86]Are we using positional?
[18:30.04]Or are we team hunting?
[18:35.26]Rock it out?
[18:36.24]Yep.
[18:36.56]I guess for this one, probably shouldn't use the... What's a place where this wouldn't be?
[18:51.64]I have to build a scene.
[18:52.38]Yeah, I gotta build a scene.
[18:54.40]How do I get out?
[18:56.62]How do I get out of here?
[19:04.05]Hello?
[19:05.81]Hello?
[19:08.35]Yeah, hold on a second.
[19:10.05]Ross was telling me about the medium ability, which lets you talk after you die.
[19:15.33]Yeah, I have that now.
[19:17.36]Yeah, it's...
[19:19.66]The proximity chat is so fucking low I can barely hear you.
[19:22.90]Yeah, it's very far.
[19:26.60]It's like impossible to hear you.
[19:28.52]But yeah, I'm using that too.
[19:31.16]Are we all just going to be the animals over here?
[19:36.13]Wait, I shouldn't say that out loud.
[19:37.81]Fuck.
[19:38.99]No, I think you're okay because you're using the TeamSpeak.
[19:41.25]Am I?
[19:41.79]I'm holding Q. Yeah, Q is TeamSpeak.
[19:44.53]Okay.
[19:48.22]Alright, listen.
[19:48.80]I'm gonna corrupt these pigs.
[19:51.38]Oh my god, I'm so stupid.
[19:52.68]I walk right into their base.
[19:54.22]Should we both be sitting here at the same time, Liam?
[19:56.16]Maybe I should move.
[19:57.02]Should I move?
[19:58.57]Uh, no.
[19:59.05]Maybe I should move.
[20:00.33]I don't know.
[20:00.83]I'm smaller.
[20:01.37]I'm smaller.
[20:02.17]I'm smaller.
[20:02.85]I don't know.
[20:03.19]But you're a bigger target.
[20:05.49]I'll move.
[20:05.85]I'll move.
[20:06.13]Common courtesy.
[20:06.97]Okay, be careful.
[20:07.39]Be careful.
[20:08.91]I will.
[20:09.21]I will.
[20:09.45]I'm so concerned.
[20:10.18]Why am I, like, flush?
[20:12.42]Alright, I've corrupted the pigs.
[20:14.08]So now, if the hunters, like, attack them, they'll get, like, damaged.
[20:18.21]I don't belong where I am.
[20:19.01]Oh, I'm building up.
[20:19.79]Okay.
[20:24.19]Oh, what's the deal with the generator?
[20:25.75]Do we do anything with that?
[20:28.64]That's where the hunters resupply.
[20:30.80]Oh, okay.
[20:36.38]Shit.
[20:37.40]Um, down.
[20:37.94]Okay.
[20:49.82]I wish I could fucking say anything.
[20:51.74]Hold R. Yeah, I know.
[20:53.84]You can orient yourself, right?
[20:58.00]I need to move, don't I?
[21:00.70]When do they come out?
[21:05.97]Oh.
[21:06.69]Here we go.
[21:07.07]I gotta clear the, uh... When do they come out?
[21:10.99]When do they actually start to come out?
[21:13.61]They've been out.
[21:14.53]They just haven't been anywhere around here yet.
[21:16.21]Oh.
[21:19.63]That scared the shit out of me.
[21:22.98]That scared the shit out of me too.
[21:25.92]Why am I so jumpy right now?
[21:27.42]Where are they?
[21:40.57]I don't like this.
[21:48.34]Should I go on the plant?
[21:49.26]I feel like I can hide that.
[21:50.34]Why am I a gigantic target?
[21:51.98]This is a... Oh, that... Oh, okay.
[21:56.27]Good.
[21:56.73]Just make sure that was you.
[21:59.05]Yeah, I'm just role-playing as a duck right now.
[22:05.56]What happens if you get to red ectoplasm?
[22:10.62]Oh, red ectoplasm means that their instruments can detect you very easily.
[22:14.66]So you got to like jump out of like jump around or jump out into different props.
[22:30.69]Oh, my God.
[22:31.79]Oh, that's scary.
[22:34.85]Oh, that's a ghost.
[22:35.35]That's a ghost.
[22:35.95]Right here.
[22:36.23]Right here.
[22:37.19]Ghost activity.
[22:38.03]Ghost activity in this step.
[22:43.35]Oh, he's gone.
[22:43.81]I don't get it.
[22:45.81]I don't know what happened.
[22:49.55]I don't get it.
[22:50.59]I don't know they had spectral.
[22:51.93]I don't know the spectral bullshit.
[22:53.63]Did you get sucked up?
[22:54.85]I got sucked up.
[22:55.51]Oh, no, you got sucked up.
[22:56.95]The ectoplasm.
[22:58.29]It's okay.
[22:58.65]Alright.
[23:00.81]If you survive, you can come back.
[23:02.77]If we survive.
[23:03.57]Alright, cool, cool, cool.
[23:06.08]I didn't understand the ectoplasm thing.
[23:07.28]Oh, my God, my corruption's detonated.
[23:12.43]I would have stayed put.
[23:13.17]I didn't know about the ectoplasm.
[23:16.53]They're all downstairs.
[23:17.35]I didn't understand it.
[23:18.37]I was blocking their way.
[23:18.89]I was at the bottom of the staircase.
[23:19.77]Long ways.
[23:19.99]Blocking their exit.
[23:20.53]I freaked out because it had a red ectoplasm.
[23:23.62]Whatever.
[23:23.96]I'm starting to think...
[23:38.04]If they come upstairs, let me know.
[23:39.33]I can, like, just jump downstairs.
[23:41.59]This is kind of fun, though.
[23:45.35]I'm just trying to clear my ectoplasm.
[23:46.95]But I don't see them near you, she says.
[23:51.84]But I don't know where they are.
[23:53.30]I walked into them.
[23:54.00]I'm an idiot.
[23:55.95]Jerma is in the same room as you, but yeah, they don't, yeah.
[23:59.01]So wait, I can go look?
[24:00.03]Is that cheating?
[24:01.65]You can kind of fuck with them a little bit right now, Jerma.
[24:04.33]You're dead, but you have an ability.
[24:06.49]I think you can freeze them a little.
[24:07.79]Oh, they're coming up to you.
[24:10.59]They'll never know if you want.
[24:12.25]They'll never know.
[24:12.81]They'll never know.
[24:13.57]It's a duck.
[24:15.87]I got him.
[24:16.45]Uh-oh.
[24:17.86]It's a duck.
[24:19.58]Chilled him.
[24:20.02]Is it really down to me again?
[24:21.28]Oh, jeez.
[24:23.50]Not yet.
[24:27.47]Don't worry, guys.
[24:32.44]They're not gonna kill me in 9 seconds.
[24:33.52]We have Midnight, so we good.
[24:36.68]Now we come back and we gotta kill them.
[24:38.22]The Earth will be dead in 3 seconds.
[24:41.08]Suck him harder.
[24:41.80]Okay, we got Ghost.
[24:43.15]Okay, if you stay close to me, I should heal slowly.
[25:00.71]Holy shit!
[25:01.67]We did it!
[25:01.99]Alright!
[25:02.23]Holy shit!
[25:03.51]Three ghosts destroyed.
[25:06.23]Three hunters knocked out.
[25:09.99]Well, nice work.
[25:11.21]I'm starting to get it.
[25:32.24]I'm starting to get it.
[25:33.12]Okay, cool.
[25:33.58]Alright, great.
[25:34.46]Yeah, no, yeah.
[25:35.84]Yeah, this is fun.
[25:37.52]Hopefully, I think we get a new map now.
[25:39.58]And I think maybe it'll scramble the teams.
[25:41.34]If not, we can do a manual scramble.
[25:44.28]Yeah, whatever.
[25:45.38]Whatever works.
[25:46.32]True, true.
[25:47.73]Yeah, for whatever.
[25:48.23]You got absolutely carried.
[25:51.51]Stop rocking back and forth.
[25:52.81]You look old.
[25:53.43]I'm rocking.
[25:54.17]Wait, what do you mean?
[25:54.85]Like this?
[25:55.21]I don't know.
[25:56.79]It's just fun to do.
[26:01.40]Alright, there's other stuff here.
[26:03.40]I have 1600 credits.
[26:04.78]It looks like we're getting the same teams.
[26:14.03]Oh, it replaces that.
[26:15.03]I think I'll try it.
[26:17.13]I want to try this thing.
[26:19.81]It's giving us the same teams.
[26:22.79]You want to do like 3 or 4 matches in a row with the same teams?
[26:25.92]And then change it back to 3 or 4 or something?
[26:28.92]Okay.
[26:29.74]Yeah, that sounds good.
[26:32.26]I'm down for whatever.
[26:32.98]This is fun.
[26:36.85]Gerber, what's your chin exercise routine?
[26:39.49]Look up at the sky, like this.
[26:41.79]And you want to put your chin up like this.
[26:44.63]And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[26:49.87]I'm going to assume this isn't DMCA.
[26:51.39]Nine, ten.
[26:53.93]You go up with your jaw.
[26:56.16]No.
[26:56.62]Also, another good one is... Is that even real?
[27:01.13]Though it probably sounds close enough to another song to get DMCA'd.
[27:06.45]That can happen?
[27:09.22]I mean, I have like 6,000 or so videos on my Fullsauce channel, and every day something new is getting claimed, that makes zero sense.
[27:18.33]Yeah, it's kind of crazy.
[27:21.03]Dude, I had crickets.
[27:22.31]I played the sound effect of crickets, not, like, because I made a bad joke, and the crickets got claimed.
[27:27.49]Look, it's the funny face guy.
[27:28.97]Whatever.
[27:31.64]That's unreal.
[27:32.66]Ugh.
[27:36.14]Alright, so now that we... Who dared to claim that?
[27:40.34]Probably a cricket.
[27:46.04]It was Criken on behalf of crickets.
[27:47.78]Alright, the ghost meter is actually pretty, I would say, like, required.
[27:54.74]Yeah.
[27:55.42]I would say so.
[27:58.00]As long as... Does anybody have a vacuum?
[28:00.94]I think we need at least one person with a vacuum, right?
[28:03.24]Oh, okay.
[28:03.84]I have def...
[28:06.37]I just dislocated my jaw with your exercise.
[28:08.92]How hard are you doing that?
[28:10.50]I got a ghost over here, guys.
[28:11.78]Just form up on me if you want to kill it.
[28:14.18]Don't let on that you know the ghost is there.
[28:17.04]Okay, never mind.
[28:17.60]What are you talking about?
[28:20.35]I didn't say sprint from one end of your room to the other while you put your chin out.
[28:24.63]I said literally go like this.
[28:34.47]so technically the game is on right now and then we are like looking for them right now it's not like a like a minute yeah yeah this is as soon as the hunters join in it's on okay cool I'm on Ross's tail right now he is a box oh where'd he go was uh now uh I see I'm so close picked up something over here over here
[28:59.17]Picked up something over here.
[29:00.65]Okay.
[29:00.93]I have my ghost rail.
[29:01.61]Oh, yeah.
[29:01.93]There we got some activity in this room, lads.
[29:04.20]There is activity.
[29:05.34]There is activity.
[29:15.69]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[29:17.27]Hey, ghost.
[29:20.93]We got a little bit of activity over here.
[29:23.01]Wait.
[29:23.97]There's somebody in this room.
[29:26.03]Never mind.
[29:33.65]What's up, dude?
[29:39.15]Got him.
[29:39.55]In the room.
[29:39.95]He's a box.
[29:40.47]He's a studio stereo equipment box.
[29:45.25]On it.
[29:51.25]Okay.
[29:51.57]Wait, what?
[29:52.67]Where'd he go?
[29:52.97]Where'd he go?
[29:53.29]Where'd he go?
[29:53.65]What happened?
[29:54.99]Where'd he go?
[29:55.31]Uh.
[29:55.37]That was very uncanny.
[30:04.50]Where'd he go?
[30:09.02]Where'd he go?
[30:09.52]I don't know where he is, but he's here.
[30:13.09]This thing is so slow to shoot.
[30:21.27]Yeah, I thought I'd like the machine gun thing, but I don't.
[30:24.51]I gotta go to resupply, hold on.
[30:28.11]This thing is poop.
[30:30.84]Can I go up the ladder?
[30:32.80]There's somebody literally right here.
[30:34.22]The lantern.
[30:34.76]What the fuck?
[30:58.59]I'm not getting any readings now.
[30:59.99]I think we got we just absolutely we got been had we got played big time I think I think he escaped
[31:21.26]Damn it.
[31:21.74]Oh, he's right here.
[31:22.64]He's literally in this room.
[31:24.60]He has to be.
[31:25.74]The market is not the market.
[31:27.42]It's not like a stock.
[31:28.53]It's going wild right now.
[31:35.37]What?
[31:35.63]Oh, God.
[31:36.79]Right here somewhere.
[31:38.79]Right here.
[31:39.69]Right here.
[31:53.17]Has to be right here.
[31:56.87]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[31:57.35]Stool, stool, stool.
[31:57.93]Good call, good call.
[31:58.66]What is it?
[31:58.96]Bucket?
[31:59.38]Stool?
[31:59.58]It's a... And not like poop.
[32:03.12]You're jolly.
[32:04.62]Do we all have the melee weapon?
[32:06.50]Does anybody have a gun?
[32:07.32]I have a shotgun, but it's doing three damage.
[32:11.38]That is the worst shotgun I've ever used.
[32:16.95]Got you.
[32:18.41]There's a fake me running around.
[32:23.28]It's dead now.
[32:24.62]Oh, it's midnight.
[32:25.30]Well, here we go.
[32:26.80]Right here.
[32:28.35]Criken is a pot.
[32:29.37]Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[32:34.13]Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.
[32:39.08]Oh, God.
[32:42.40]God damn it.
[32:43.84]Dude, I'd love to revive you guys, but uh... I need a gun.
[32:47.71]It's okay.
[32:48.75]This shotgun... My brothers in Christ, we have failed.
[32:50.99]Dude, that melee weapon sucks.
[32:54.65]Yeah.
[32:55.53]Yeah, I'm not using that anymore.
[32:57.71]So many of these weapons are, like, kind of... Truce?
[33:03.72]Half of us were using the little, like, light stick.
[33:10.14]Need to level up Arcane.
[33:16.09]I feel like, yeah, it's like the Combine weapon from Half-Life 2.
[33:20.75]It kind of is, yeah.
[33:26.14]Who's still alive?
[33:28.96]I am.
[33:29.74]I'm just booking it.
[33:31.10]I'm just trying to, like, outlast, I guess.
[33:33.42]I don't know what to do.
[33:34.66]I'm literally watching you when I ask that question.
[33:37.14]For some reason, I thought that you were a ghost.
[33:39.27]I don't know why.
[33:39.97]I thought he was a ghost.
[33:42.49]I thought we were ghosts for one second.
[33:46.67]Oh my god.
[33:47.57]Oh my god.
[33:49.98]Is this working out?
[33:50.84]They're just chasing you, I think.
[33:52.38]I mean, it's working, but there's... I'm going to play the wrestling game tomorrow.
[33:58.82]Should I just take the owl?
[34:00.96]You can do whatever you think is correct, my brother in Geist.
[34:05.79]Perform an accelerated back off through the theater.
[34:10.53]Book it to the next QPU.
[34:12.55]Yeah.
[34:13.81]I will, but what is that?
[34:15.92]Well, you see, in Mario 64, QPUs are positional universes.
[34:22.50]To do that, we need to talk about parallel universes.
[34:26.40]Why can they not get you?
[34:28.14]Does anybody, do they have a move?
[34:29.63]They're just running behind you.
[34:33.81]They have to have ghost moves, right?
[34:35.43]Oh, what?
[34:39.81]Oh, no.
[34:41.27]Oh.
[34:46.66]Yeah, go team chair.
[34:50.04]The chair wins.
[34:52.24]Ghost, after this next round, when the next map is about to happen, I'm going to exit and we can all join a new lobby and we'll go into new teams.
[35:01.70]Alright, I get it.
[35:04.40]I want to hide more.
[35:06.08]Now that I understand how it works.
[35:08.92]Nice straw.
[35:09.67]Sorry, I'm not very loud.
[35:12.80]no what you're okay no you're good it's a straw is there a problem with straws why do you why is your Steam profile picture alone in the dark I don't know I haven't changed it since like 2013 or something I don't know okay this is important remotely charge up objects looks like a ghost charging up
[35:41.31]I'm going to try that one.
[35:42.09]So are we playing this game or are we backing out?
[35:46.68]Yeah, we're doing this one.
[35:47.98]Yeah, when it changes to the next map, then I'll make a new server.
[35:52.88]Random sound.
[35:54.34]I found an ability that lets you create false radar readings.
[35:57.72]That'll be good.
[35:59.00]That's probably what was happening to us that whole time.
[36:01.80]Yeah.
[36:02.71]Apparently, you can throw your voice.
[36:05.27]All you have to do is aim, hold left shift, and press C and talk.
[36:09.55]So, like, I can throw my voice, like,
[36:13.57]She says, tell me if you can hear me in proximity.
[36:17.13]Okay.
[36:20.12]I hear you on my left ear.
[36:22.68]Something really small.
[36:23.76]Yeah, I'm really far away from you.
[36:25.56]I just threw my voice to you.
[36:28.56]Oh, that's cool.
[36:32.34]I think I'm going to go sit in one of those chairs.
[36:35.39]You do that.
[36:37.11]They'll never know.
[36:38.23]If we find more buckets, we can put them in chairs.
[36:46.89]Is this too obvious?
[36:47.55]I don't think they're even going to look over here.
[36:50.73]Who's the piano?
[36:52.45]Can you just jump to clear the ectoplasm?
[36:55.77]Yeah, you can.
[37:05.92]The fuck, dude?
[37:06.52]You're the piano?
[37:07.70]You're the Mario 64 piano?
[37:09.22]I need to lean forward like the other ones are.
[37:12.95]That was probably a terrible idea.
[37:14.35]I don't know why I did that.
[37:15.57]Who here has the scanner?
[37:18.19]I didn't get it.
[37:18.65]I got the defib.
[37:20.50]Oh no.
[37:20.96]Did none of us get the scanner?
[37:22.94]No.
[37:24.80]They didn't get the scanner.
[37:26.64]You can get it.
[37:27.08]There's a resupply, resupply.
[37:29.46]Yeah, resupply.
[37:30.64]Over here.
[37:32.00]Vinny.
[37:32.20]Somebody needs a vaccine.
[37:33.32]What's that?
[37:34.04]Oh, I'm sorry.
[37:34.64]What are you?
[37:35.24]You guys can't find me?
[37:37.14]Oh, that's... Wow.
[37:38.42]Vinny.
[37:39.76]Long time no see, man.
[37:40.60]Find me, huh?
[37:41.24]They're far away.
[37:41.66]I'm going to go this way.
[37:43.79]Listen, ghost.
[37:44.77]I mean, ghost hunters.
[37:46.11]I'm a ghost, of course.
[37:47.27]I'm gonna go this way.
[37:53.27]Something so humorous about Jerma Tokyo drifting through the door there.
[37:57.43]As a chair.
[37:57.85]Oh, man.
[38:26.43]Perfect.
[38:26.91]Okay.
[38:27.59]I can fake him out.
[38:33.05]Stop moving.
[38:33.55]I have to.
[38:35.11]Look at the ectoplasm build up.
[38:37.40]I have to move.
[38:38.08]I can revive.
[38:38.54]They're teabagging my shards.
[38:58.12]They're all on the first floor.
[39:03.56]Nope, there's one up top, basically.
[39:05.46]Oh yeah, one just walked by, Vinny.
[39:10.50]Uh-oh.
[39:14.20]I'm watching this from up here.
[39:16.62]I'm trying to clear the build-up.
[39:33.30]Wow.
[39:34.68]Wow, I cannot believe that just happened.
[39:37.20]What happened?
[39:38.06]Oh, I just missed it!
[39:38.84]Why would there be a ladder here?
[39:39.92]It was already here!
[39:40.52]There was someone that was looking for Vinny, and Vinny just kind of booked it over the balcony.
[39:44.79]Oh, great.
[39:45.31]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[39:46.07]I had like a gamer moment.
[39:47.73]I can't believe it.
[39:49.09]Well, not that kind of one, but... I'm gonna save that for you so you can get a third-person perspective.
[39:54.38]Do you guys remember Geist for GameCube?
[39:57.22]I do remember Geist.
[39:58.56]That's what this is, multiplayer Geist.
[40:02.47]It was on What Happened recently, Geist.
[40:06.39]Oh, yeah.
[40:07.99]Great show.
[40:09.69]And yeah, I haven't been able to forget about it since playing this.
[40:15.58]Oh, man.
[40:16.08]That game was okay.
[40:19.38]Shit!
[40:19.88]The very okayest game.
[40:21.51]Yeah.
[40:31.83]I'm like a trampoline.
[40:33.68]I don't know what to do.
[40:34.44]I don't understand.
[40:35.64]Got me a bitch.
[40:37.47]It's too stressful.
[40:39.05]It's too stressful.
[41:02.26]I can't do this.
[41:04.04]I can't do it.
[41:04.74]I can't fucking do this.
[41:06.04]It's too stressful.
[41:06.96]This is too stressful It's the aisle.
[41:08.56]I can't it's too stress.
[41:09.70]I'm gonna lose it nice.
[41:10.80]You know I don't I don't get it I don't know it's like I'd freak out.
[41:13.86]I think they can see me at all fucking sides I Think it's like too stressful
[41:27.19]Yes, Vinny, keep distracting them.
[41:28.59]I don't know.
[41:28.91]I feel like they can see me.
[41:29.99]I'm just going to keep jumping.
[41:35.60]Are you teabagging my ghost corpse?
[41:44.00]I think they lagged out.
[41:49.30]Now, are they lagging or just teabagging aggressively?
[41:53.37]Oh shit, it's midnight.
[41:54.29]Vinny's gonna kill us, Ron!
[41:56.07]There was one left!
[41:57.07]It's time!
[42:07.58]On my couch!
[42:17.42]It's time for you to pay.
[42:21.48]Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have yeeted myself down the stairs.
[42:25.92]But, I don't know.
[42:27.38]I've never played these games.
[42:28.60]I don't know what it looks like.
[42:29.98]Alright, I'm not that sorry.
[42:39.91]Not even a little sorry.
[42:41.99]Fuck.
[42:45.83]I'm doing a lot of distractions for you guys to watch.
[42:56.77]I'm trying I'm trying to hit him we can if you yeah, yeah, there you go Just various objects
[43:23.56]Yeah, like that.
[43:25.79]Good job.
[43:44.63]Come here!
[43:51.13]God dammit!
[43:54.55]There you go, you almost got it I'm trying Ghosts if you want more speed You have to possess an object and right-click hold it and then you can like start.
[44:09.77]What are you doing?
[44:12.34]Did you just like suck the ectoplasm out of that corpse?
[44:15.10]Yes, that's normal
[44:25.34]I wish I would have seen that kill.
[44:30.61]Jeremy, you're kind of an idiot in this game.
[44:36.15]Let's see how well you do with 12 minutes in a game in a genre that you've never played before, in a space that you've never been in before, in a area that you've never seen before.
[44:50.78]You understand that?
[44:51.58]I'm trying.
[44:52.23]Okay, relax.
[44:54.12]Relax.
[44:54.86]Everything's fine.
[44:58.40]Use a fee?
[45:12.27]No, I'm just kidding.
[45:14.37]No, I never played Propon, ever.
[45:18.43]I know this has been around for like... Alright, this is like I've never played a game... This is like never playing a game of Call of Duty in your whole life.
[45:31.75]Hey, I just solidified that game right there.
[45:42.12]I got the last kill.
[45:42.96]I think I did pretty good.
[45:47.42]Never played TF2?
[45:48.46]No.
[45:50.46]I was always a super contrarian and didn't want to play Prop Hunt because it was so popular that I was like, nah, it's not me.
[45:56.42]I'm not playing that.
[45:58.16]It's a popular thing.
[46:03.25]I got a new code.
[46:12.05]I was very much aware of his existence.
[46:14.31]You're a hipster, yeah.
[46:18.89]You can say that.
[46:20.23]That's fine.
[46:22.45]You're in your right to say that.
[46:29.47]Is the guy who played Elden Ring 15 times in a row.
[46:31.69]What does that have to do with anything?
[46:37.01]Wait, I think maybe I... Did I play... You have video of TF2 Prop Hunt, I'm pretty sure.
[46:40.97]Yeah, but like... I don't... That was like eight years ago.
[46:49.94]I played it once.
[46:54.00]Yeah, sorry.
[46:54.68]I forgot that I played TF2 Prop Hunt like nine years ago.
[46:58.66]One time.
[47:02.81]What would it say?
[47:03.47]How am I supposed- I don't know.
[47:05.54]I don't remember.
[47:06.74]Dude, tell me what you had for breakfast two weeks ago.
[47:15.72]I bet you- what'd you have for- okay, what did you have for breakfast on April 2nd, 2022?
[47:22.14]What did you eat for breakfast?
[47:25.32]Do you fucking even know?
[47:28.39]No, you can't.
[47:30.37]Dude, it was nine, like eight or nine years ago.
[47:34.46]And I probably, dude, it was, I probably forgot it immediately after it happened.
[47:37.62]That's so funny.
[47:43.46]But it's a different game.
[47:45.00]This is completely different.
[47:47.42]Ooh, new map.
[47:47.84]Hello team, can you hear me?
[47:52.31]Are we on the same team?
[47:54.31]Yeah, it looks like only one person difference.
[47:56.51]We just, we have Jolly now.
[47:58.21]We traded for jelly, which is fine.
[48:01.39]No, it's really not.
[48:03.11]It's weird because, seriously, I can't find a way to randomize or change teams between people.
[48:09.67]It seems like that just isn't an option.
[48:13.13]Hey, what did you guys have for breakfast nine years ago?
[48:20.24]Bacon, egg, and cheese.
[48:21.76]Almost guaranteed.
[48:22.58]Guaranteed?
[48:24.34]Almost.
[48:26.93]currently going back and forth to chat about a few things.
[48:29.43]Okay.
[48:32.65]Sorry, that took me off guard.
[48:36.09]I have to say, probably Honey Nut Cheerios.
[48:44.52]I mean, lately, not that this is in any way relevant to the question that Jerma had asked, but lately,
[48:52.19]It's been bagel Vinny just shot Jermas bit the bits did I ruin your bit Jerma no ever okay?
[48:57.79]So everyone's everyone's yelling at me over here because they're like how do you not know how to play proper?
[49:02.34]And I was like dude.
[49:02.90]I've never played prop on right somebody pulled away watch somebody pulled out an old video from like 2013 I was gonna set Yeah, I don't remember playing prop on so I'm like what'd you have for breakfast two weeks ago on April 2nd?
[49:17.95]Oh?
[49:21.04]Also, Criken.
[49:21.72]Wow, I found you!
[49:24.76]I found you!
[49:25.32]Come on!
[49:29.76]Dude!
[49:31.00]Wait, the match already started?
[49:32.72]He's swords!
[49:33.76]He's swords!
[49:37.07]Does anyone have a vacuum?
[49:38.87]Yeah.
[49:39.71]Oh, my God.
[49:41.67]It's all me.
[49:44.39]I just randomly shot a duck.
[49:46.51]Okay, guys, I just randomly shot that duck because I thought it would be funny and it was Criken.
[49:50.69]Dude, shoot fucking everything.
[49:53.89]There's no downside to just wrecking absolutely everything.
[49:56.73]Yeah, there isn't.
[50:01.68]Which makes no sense because usually there's like a risk-reward.
[50:05.38]But yeah, apparently we don't need that.
[50:06.74]Yeah, we were talking about breakfast nine years ago and suddenly Criken is dead.
[50:11.67]I feel a chill.
[50:13.35]We've got a ghost here where I am.
[50:15.03]Have you guys played a game that you don't remember playing from 10 years ago?
[50:19.14]Dude, I don't remember what I played last week.
[50:21.88]Constantly.
[50:23.68]Thank you.
[50:24.26]Wait, what do you mean?
[50:26.54]Treasure chest.
[50:30.85]That you don't remember playing 10 years ago, but you have played it?
[50:33.17]Yeah.
[50:33.65]Is that what you're saying?
[50:35.29]Oh, uh, probably any Call of Duty game from then.
[50:38.45]Yeah, dude, you know how many Steam games I probably have downloaded that I've played like maybe 30 minutes of and went, well, I don't know, this game sucks.
[50:44.79]And then never played it again and forgot I ever bought it.
[50:49.27]Guys, Criken is haunting me.
[50:53.29]It's probably because you shot a duck.
[50:57.05]I'm sorry, Criken.
[50:58.29]I thought it would be funny to shoot the duck.
[50:59.99]I'm sorry.
[51:00.71]How is this happening?
[51:03.43]Well, because I'm just looking for objects that are slightly out of place.
[51:09.21]I'm playing the video game, you know?
[51:11.59]Interreading.
[51:13.23]That's a lie.
[51:13.91]I didn't mean that to sound so sassy.
[51:15.46]I apologize.
[51:15.82]How dare you not talk about breakfast that you ate.
[51:20.74]Something right here.
[51:21.56]Look, man.
[51:22.38]All I'm saying is while Jerm is getting a lot of shit for this, I literally have played mods that I forgot that I played like two months before I played them again.
[51:34.37]That doesn't make your shit inexcusable, Jerma.
[51:36.99]Come on.
[51:37.97]I mean, I played a mod of a... I played Prop Hunt nine years ago, and I don't remember playing it.
[51:46.67]How do you... But do you not remember the craze on YouTube where literally everybody played it?
[51:52.22]Oh, absolutely.
[51:53.40]I just don't remember being a part of the craze.
[51:56.90]But, like, surely you know a bit of this from Osmosis.
[51:59.46]Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[52:03.16]To be fair though, this is a little more prop hunty than usual prop hunt.
[52:08.68]It's actually... Not to correct you, but it's less prop hunt than normal prop hunt really.
[52:16.28]I don't know why.
[52:26.15]There's nothing in the boat.
[52:27.55]Okay, there's nothing.
[52:29.05]I just love that this is a pirate map.
[52:30.69]He's literally being a pirate in the boat.
[52:33.13]He was taunting me before.
[52:34.23]Now, are there skeleton ghosts, or are we doing squid ghosts?
[52:39.31]What do we got?
[52:40.33]I just watched Pirates of the Caribbean.
[52:46.33]Squid ghosts.
[52:47.45]Which one?
[52:49.35]I watched the first two.
[52:50.61]Why can't squids have ghosts, Charlie?
[52:52.64]What is this?
[52:54.44]Well, I mean, they can, but I don't think they'd be particularly cerebral.
[53:00.63]I don't think there's much going on in a squid brain other than eat food, eat food, shit, eat food, eat food, sleep.
[53:06.03]They're very smart.
[53:07.11]They're very smart animals.
[53:08.65]Cephalopods, man.
[53:09.95]Mental.
[53:10.29]I thought that was octopuses.
[53:13.43]I don't know any better.
[53:14.09]That made me feel guilty for eating squid.
[53:16.43]I love squid.
[53:16.69]I don't need octopuses.
[53:17.17]I'm just making stuff up, but... Yep.
[53:20.79]So am I, but... You know.
[53:23.97]Somebody's chilling me.
[53:24.91]Any readings at all?
[53:26.45]Down here.
[53:26.95]Something down here.
[53:28.41]I found him.
[53:28.79]I found a piece of box.
[53:30.29]Oh shit, okay.
[53:33.04]Oh, he's something else.
[53:33.82]He's literally in this room.
[53:38.72]The salt water is corroding your soup.
[53:41.84]What?
[53:42.94]Where the fuck is he?
[53:45.91]He has to be right here somewhere.
[53:47.39]Like literally right here.
[53:51.89]Yeah, we got strong readings down here.
[53:53.41]Alright, we're about to get fucked.
[53:55.87]So stick together, run.
[54:02.56]He just fucking murdered him.
[54:03.68]Oh my god!
[54:09.64]Oh, he's solo.
[54:12.34]I'm knocked out.
[54:13.28]Looks like I'm playing Doom, hold on.
[54:18.87]Squids are able to count, solve problems, recognize patterns, and communicate.
[54:24.95]Dude, squids can play video games.
[54:31.58]You think squids got kind of fell out of an alien spaceship driving across the Earth and fell in the ocean and just kind of kept going?
[54:39.75]I mean that that sounds like a good enough theory for me at being non-biology.
[54:46.64]Yeah.
[54:48.42]Oh, fuck.
[54:49.42]Oh, that's all of my health.
[54:50.52]I have six.
[54:53.32]You're so low, but.
[54:55.91]I have faith.
[54:56.53]You got this, dude.
[54:57.41]I believe in you.
[54:58.35]No, just shoot.
[54:59.51]Yeah, Vinny, so how was Pirates of the Caribbean 1 and 2?
[55:04.15]Very good.
[55:05.03]And I will tell you this to comfort you as you die, but I will say that I like 2 maybe a little bit better than 1.
[55:10.80]Really?
[55:11.92]Maybe a little bit.
[55:13.07]just because I liked the squids.
[55:14.61]They were pretty cool.
[55:16.39]Incredibly relevant point.
[55:17.72]I've seen all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
[55:19.70]I don't remember any of them.
[55:21.38]I thought Curse of the Black Pearl was kind of a classic to me, but I thought Dead Man's Chest was a little too long for its own good.
[55:34.66]I just got called out for having shit taste for liking the sequel.
[55:38.20]Like, a little bit better than the first one.
[55:39.46]I mean, you could look at it like that.
[55:42.50]I mean, you could, Vinny, but you're wrong.
[55:46.65]You know, incorrect opinions are basically what I live for.
[55:49.81]There were four Pirates of the Caribbean movies, right?
[55:54.23]Oh, shit.
[55:54.69]I'm about to quarter.
[55:55.33]Five, actually.
[55:55.79]There were, like, seven.
[55:56.73]Oh, five.
[55:59.39]Close to seven.
[56:00.01]Why am I still alive?
[56:01.15]That range was so all over the place.
[56:03.55]Oh, no, there are seven.
[56:04.65]No, there are five.
[56:05.64]There are four.
[56:07.60]That feels like there are seven.
[56:09.68]There's seven.
[56:11.60]Paying attention after the third.
[56:17.84]That's when I'm going to stop.
[56:18.78]I'm going to watch the third one.
[56:19.80]I'm just going to stop.
[56:21.30]Yeah, that was the last one that Verbinski directed.
[56:24.14]Then he went to do Rango.
[56:25.40]If you haven't seen that, that's a great movie.
[56:27.66]I've heard about that one.
[56:28.96]Animated movie.
[56:31.06]I think I've only seen two.
[56:32.60]That one actually won the Oscar that year.
[56:34.08]There's so much fucking media nowadays.
[56:36.13]There's so much.
[56:37.55]There's only so much room in our brains to be able to remember all this fucking media.
[56:42.67]Think of all the video games, all the movies, all the breakfasts you've had.
[56:48.41]Gemma, I just want to say, I'm going from agreeing with you to maybe he has early onset Alzheimer's.
[56:53.67]Really, real quick here.
[56:57.06]That's usually me.
[57:00.09]Like, who remembers what they ate for breakfast?
[57:02.19]Who remembers what they did yesterday?
[57:03.61]I don't remember what I was playing yesterday.
[57:05.21]Who remembers the movie?
[57:06.97]I don't remember movies.
[57:09.57]Yeah, but I mean, I remember what I did yesterday, but not like eight years ago.
[57:15.32]I was so keen on surviving there, jeez.
[57:17.76]I was so, I was one minute away.
[57:21.12]I've played so much Elden Ring in the past, like,
[57:26.01]Oh, I wanted to hear his take.
[57:28.43]I wanted to hear the Elden Ring take.
[57:29.65]I'm getting eviscerated right now.
[57:39.40]Okay.
[57:39.62]I want to try that board again.
[57:41.14]Yeah, I'm going to try that point again.
[57:43.32]I've been playing so much Elden Ring that there's a good chance in a year I'm not going to remember more than the fact that there were some dudes that looked like Foreskin.
[57:53.60]It's a huge game.
[57:55.64]There's so much to see.
[57:57.02]It's just so much.
[57:58.30]There's just too much.
[58:00.62]I can't wait for like two years from now when everybody decides to replay it at the exact same time.
[58:06.53]Yeah.
[58:07.69]DLC, you mean?
[58:10.11]Yeah, pretty much.
[58:18.11]So even though we're not playing Elden Ring right now, what are your builds?
[58:20.96]What's everybody's builds?
[58:21.84]What did they run through the game?
[58:24.17]I've been doing a bunch of different things, but I do a little bit of int magic and mostly decks.
[58:29.31]So I'm using... I do twin blades.
[58:35.99]Bastard.
[58:36.78]This guy is bastard for his build.
[58:42.22]Alright, we're just going to try all sitting in the exact same spot, huh?
[58:46.20]Oh, we're all here.
[58:47.10]Good plan.
[58:49.34]Oh, no.
[58:49.96]I'm not over here yet.
[58:51.18]I got a good spot.
[58:51.92]It's actually really good.
[58:54.17]Because I'm going to corrupt these crates.
[58:57.81]Oh.
[58:58.57]What does that do?
[59:02.82]I mean, it corrupts them, I guess.
[59:08.34]I got a really good plan here.
[59:10.80]Sorry, I'm just shaking off the ectoplasm.
[59:12.20]That's a good call.
[59:18.48]I forgot about that.
[59:26.84]You can press V to ding, apparently.
[59:29.22]To ding?
[59:29.68]Yeah, you can ding.
[59:33.46]I wonder if the enemy team can hear that.
[59:39.49]And it stops ectoplasm buildup.
[59:43.67]Oh, that's cool.
[59:50.35]Yes.
[59:52.77]Remember to throw your voice.
[59:56.55]That shift, and then, uh... I'll chat, right?
[60:03.65]Yeah.
[60:08.39]By the way, Leon, they can totally hear you going as you're jumping up and down.
[60:13.93]Oh.
[60:14.77]Aided.
[60:15.75]That does make noise.
[60:16.79]I will just have to be light-footed, then.
[60:20.82]I mean, I'm a treasure chest, but it'll work.
[60:26.33]Just ding.
[60:29.53]Ring the bell, smash the link, subscribe.
[60:34.67]I saw it move, Bill.
[60:39.53]Accidentally got out of the ship.
[60:53.65]Oh, if you do 25 taunts in one game, you get an achievement.
[60:56.39]Oh, right here.
[60:57.61]Right here.
[61:02.39]I see him.
[61:02.72]I see him.
[61:03.46]Oh, yeah.
[61:04.56]Oh, I can't go that way!
[61:07.76]Run, Jerma.
[61:08.84]Jerma was the one that ended up getting chased first.
[61:12.22]Yeah, and we're being complete assholes and dinging.
[61:14.70]Oh, good harpoon.
[61:15.71]Yeah, now we got him.
[61:28.23]Uh, lads, here they come.
[61:36.68]Oh, yeah, what button is that?
[61:39.74]What?
[61:40.12]What'd you press?
[61:46.94]I left my mark, and so did Kurt Cobain.
[61:49.75]I wish I could... How do I... I don't want to talk.
[61:51.45]You certainly did.
[61:54.65]I lost him, by the way.
[61:57.39]Oh, nice.
[61:58.45]Here's the problem with putting your spray paint down is that it's not prop.
[62:05.96]It's not prop?
[62:07.04]What?
[62:07.72]It's not proper because it's not.
[62:10.10]Like, we're giving away that we're props.
[62:14.19]You know what?
[62:14.63]I'm going to spray it elsewhere.
[62:15.89]As opposed to the dinging and the jumping before, which was totally inconspicuous.
[62:21.29]Yeah, I think that was alright.
[62:23.81]I'm back.
[62:24.14]I just had to place my spray over there.
[62:27.16]Let me spray on the wall.
[62:28.54]Blocking the fucking door by the way.
[62:30.97]Hold on, big brain move.
[62:32.23]Oh no!
[62:32.91]Little brain move.
[63:07.98]Good spot.
[63:17.23]Fuck.
[63:18.99]Why am I still alive?
[63:22.13]You've been dinging very well.
[63:26.19]Did you like my dings?
[63:27.69]This is a good round.
[63:28.74]Good round.
[63:29.38]I don't know how to respond to that.
[63:35.18]This is a really good round so far.
[63:38.38]Yeah, surprisingly good.
[63:45.63]I want to say it's not us, it's them, because I'm currently dinging repeatedly and the spray is right behind my head.
[63:52.45]They just don't seem to care.
[63:53.69]Nice.
[63:57.52]If they die, they probably had it coming.
[64:05.12]Kind of heartless, but correct.
[64:07.83]Why am I dying?
[64:08.45]What's going on?
[64:10.67]Already dead.
[64:18.19]The seeing the hunters through the walls perk is fucking broke as shit.
[64:23.33]Where are they?
[64:24.89]I didn't know that was a perk.
[64:28.16]I thought that was a passive for everybody.
[64:29.66]Yeah, that perk is insane.
[64:34.98]We got a location on them?
[64:36.93]They're all hiding behind the... At the back of the ship here.
[64:39.49]The... This part of the ship.
[64:42.47]The poop deck?
[64:43.51]The poop deck.
[64:44.37]The stern.
[64:45.17]The stern.
[64:46.31]Is that also the poop deck?
[64:48.19]I killed one.
[64:52.97]Nice job.
[64:58.84]Criken and Ross left.
[65:00.28]Salt damages ghosts?
[65:03.22]Yeah.
[65:03.74]That's...
[65:06.54]Some some I guess anybody has a boat phasmophobia.
[65:11.62]I don't see anyone in the boat, but.
[65:21.09]On me.
[65:25.11]Back to the boat.
[65:28.19]We need a pinch of them.
[65:36.10]Go to a gas can.
[65:37.05]Jerma.
[65:37.59]Jerma, gas can.
[65:38.37]Got him.
[65:38.99]Oh, damn, Jerma.
[65:40.85]Hold on.
[65:42.59]Damn, dude.
[65:43.05]That was fucking savage.
[65:44.51]Next round.
[65:48.27]Get that consume.
[65:48.93]Nice work.
[65:53.22]Eat.
[65:54.94]Only one left.
[65:59.94]So it just kind of becomes reverse hide and seek at the end.
[66:02.97]It kind of does.
[66:03.75]Yeah.
[66:11.31]Uh, who's left?
[66:12.41]Is it Criken?
[66:13.67]Yeah.
[66:15.77]Criken, where are you?
[66:17.97]He's probably like crouching behind something over here.
[66:27.57]I'm definitely getting that perk.
[66:29.36]The see-through walls one.
[66:31.70]It's very handy.
[66:32.56]He's on the top of the ship, everybody.
[66:35.06]He's like on one of the masts.
[66:36.18]Oh my god, if I just looked up, I would have seen him.
[66:38.46]Fucking hell, I'm an idiot.
[66:40.76]Oh, I almost made it.
[66:41.34]I demand your blood.
[66:50.18]Ouch.
[66:53.83]Still up top?
[66:54.21]Nope, you're right here.
[66:55.77]Nice job.
[67:00.29]Good, good, good, good.
[67:01.39]This is a souped up prop hunt.
[67:05.73]It kind of is, yeah.
[67:08.79]Box.
[67:10.80]Do we want to change up teams or do we want to keep going?
[67:13.76]What do you think?
[67:14.22]I don't know.
[67:15.50]It's up to you guys.
[67:18.72]I'm fine.
[67:18.96]I'm going to shuffle.
[67:19.72]You want to shuffle again?
[67:21.40]I think it depends on who gets in first.
[67:23.97]Is the first team, I think?
[67:28.03]Okay.
[67:28.41]So let's shuffle.
[67:29.33]I'll exit this.
[67:31.27]Okay.
[67:35.99]That's fun.
[67:36.71]That's cool.
[67:38.54]That was your best game yet?
[67:39.81]I mean, I'm starting to figure it out.
[67:41.87]I definitely want that see people through walls thing, because that's ridiculous.
[67:45.01]I'll put it on.
[67:50.67]I like to smash it into people.
[68:00.34]You can throw your voice with shift plus C. Is that a perk, or can I just do that?
[68:07.84]You look sweaty.
[68:08.38]I don't think so.
[68:10.12]I'm a little flush for some reason.
[68:11.42]I don't know why.
[68:11.76]Okay, let's get in.
[68:22.62]I want to take a good look at those perks.
[68:32.61]Kind of like the Huntsman?
[68:33.43]It kind of is.
[68:34.07]Yeah.
[68:38.05]Alright, let's do some loadout stuff.
[68:39.09]Alright.
[68:42.01]Ghost loadout.
[68:43.99]This one here.
[68:45.79]See hunters through walls.
[68:47.25]Okay, I can unlock it.
[68:49.21]Definitely want that.
[68:51.09]Even before midnight.
[68:53.99]That seems like, why would you pick anything else?
[68:57.95]Telekinesis is so good.
[69:00.69]I was able to live through that whole thing.
[69:02.23]I tricked the whole team for like a full minute.
[69:07.25]Deadly and ghostly mist.
[69:11.76]Corruptor.
[69:16.20]That's not bad either.
[69:20.16]Someone's a fake ghost?
[69:21.30]Oh, shit.
[69:22.00]I didn't get to look.
[69:32.83]I don't know about these, though.
[69:34.37]Flamethrower?
[69:35.92]I mean, hi, Criken.
[69:37.68]We're finally on the same team, which is nice.
[69:42.95]I wish it was easier to, like, customize the teams, but anyway.
[69:48.02]Sorry about the duck incident.
[69:52.58]You don't have to apologize to me, man.
[69:54.46]I would have done the same.
[69:56.74]I saw a duck.
[69:57.42]I got excited, man.
[69:58.30]I don't know.
[69:58.80]I just sometimes... That was where the duck spawned, though.
[70:02.84]Like, I didn't even move it.
[70:03.78]I was like, this is perfect.
[70:05.08]He just fucking shot me immediately.
[70:06.55]Just went right in.
[70:10.51]Is the sniper any good?
[70:14.85]Probably not.
[70:16.67]Oh.
[70:18.09]You gonna snipe a fucking box, man?
[70:20.83]That's true.
[70:21.41]Do they, like, make new songs for, like, this game?
[70:30.02]or did they like go to um yeah is it new songs zero percent this might be a new song yeah I haven't heard this one before it must be new this is a good song I do like it guitar solo is fantastic
[70:53.92]It's very, very generic David Gilmour, Pink Floyd.
[70:56.48]Borderlands music?
[70:58.04]Seems like adequate small talk on the way to Ohana Mansion.
[71:02.02]Have we been to this one yet?
[71:02.88]No.
[71:03.38]Oh, yeah, we have.
[71:07.13]You know what?
[71:07.55]We did a practice.
[71:10.47]What?
[71:12.09]We're right here.
[71:13.85]What happened?
[71:15.89]The sensitivity is way too high.
[71:19.65]This is an easy one, man.
[71:21.41]Ghosts just hanging out in this...
[71:28.13]That's better.
[71:35.94]If you guys see a ghost, let me know.
[71:37.04]Is that a ghost?
[71:37.76]Or did I move that with my body?
[71:39.54]It's probably a glizzy.
[71:40.60]Yeah.
[71:41.50]Okay.
[71:41.90]Alright.
[71:42.28]Hear me?
[71:43.74]I hate the word glizzy, but I can't stop saying it.
[71:46.00]Someone just dinged.
[71:49.10]What's the definition of a glizzy?
[71:50.42]Hello?
[71:50.74]It's Ross.
[71:51.44]A glizzy is apparently slang for a hot dog, and I have no idea why this happened.
[71:58.17]Is that a New York thing?
[72:01.87]I think it was in... I've explained this and this has come up on my stream like five days in a row.
[72:06.07]Like five streams in a row.
[72:07.09]But it apparently started as slang for a Glock in prison in like Florida.
[72:12.04]And then somehow it became slang for a hot dog.
[72:16.18]Really?
[72:21.30]Down in the dining room, I'm getting some activity.
[72:24.98]On the way.
[72:31.12]Yeah.
[72:31.92]Yeah.
[72:32.52]It's a table.
[72:34.58]I lost it.
[72:36.89]I'll check this chair.
[72:41.75]No budget pyro.
[72:42.77]Oh my God.
[72:43.15]I got him.
[72:43.97]What?
[72:45.33]It was the chair?
[72:45.93]I threw C4 on the chair and it was... Just so you know why we were... Nice.
[72:51.26]Why we were all at the door, it's because I got soft locked.
[72:55.90]Oh, really?
[72:57.48]Oh, man.
[72:59.56]Oh, that's not fair.
[73:07.52]I thought you guys are just hanging out there.
[73:10.38]We're trying to get me Somebody's digging in here redo or no no keep going keep going That other ability Does the ding mean
[73:30.07]Can there be a painting?
[73:30.73]That ding was literally in my head.
[74:02.01]Oh, no.
[74:02.33]They're not upstairs.
[74:03.05]They're not upstairs.
[74:03.87]They're not upstairs.
[74:04.47]Oh, they're not over here.
[74:17.43]No, they're not downstairs.
[74:18.55]They're not downstairs.
[74:20.69]Okay.
[74:25.65]I swear to God, somebody is in this room.
[74:30.04]I don't know if you can be door.
[74:31.16]We're going to look real foolish once we figure out where this person is.
[74:38.90]In the fire?
[74:39.69]I didn't bring my ghost detecting instrument.
[74:42.01]I should get that.
[74:42.61]I think something was just in front of me.
[74:53.88]Did I miss it?
[75:01.57]Where the fuck is this person?
[75:08.89]I'm getting strong readings.
[75:09.88]They're the candle on the table.
[75:10.98]They're the candle.
[75:16.22]Wait, they're the candles?
[75:19.14]It was the candle on the table.
[75:20.21]Oh, I don't know where they went.
[75:25.13]I don't know.
[75:25.47]I have no idea.
[75:25.95]I have no...
[75:29.77]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
[75:31.00]Right here.
[75:43.00]This fucking sniper sucks.
[75:53.75]Just spray everywhere! They're- they're not- alright, we're good.
[75:59.75]Several things.
[76:01.45]He was a candle on the dining room table.
[76:04.19]I was the candle sitting on the table.
[76:06.53]It turned into... He was like table with sheet on it.
[76:11.14]Yeah.
[76:11.70]I was the candle on the table.
[76:13.74]I was proud of myself for two seconds, and then I realized, yeah, two of those kills were just because you were in the lobby stuck.
[76:19.48]I don't know.
[76:20.45]How do we not randomly spray you or hit you when you were on the table?
[76:25.74]It was hilarious, honestly.
[76:26.94]I was watching you just walk over him.
[76:29.20]That's crazy.
[76:30.00]Alright, leveled up.
[76:32.67]I want to unlock new skins so I don't look like... The candle was body blocking you.
[76:43.37]Have you seen Arcane?
[76:44.44]What are your thoughts on the show?
[76:46.40]I think it's on the first episode.
[76:51.44]The only thing I remember from Arcane was...
[76:55.36]the misery Every single person is my enemy It's all it's the only thing I know I don't know anything else And the song goes oh Imagine dragons that they have that formula down they have that I
[77:23.94]Salt circle blocks your path.
[77:25.56]Oh, that's the... Okay.
[77:32.30]And dude, by the way, when that song comes on, when I saw that intro, like a warmth raises over my body.
[77:37.32]Like I'm like, it's like, it's not chills, but it's like a... Jeez, here we go.
[77:51.27]I don't like this spot at all, by the way.
[77:54.98]Freaking what are you?
[77:57.68]You're the door?
[78:01.54]Telephone.
[78:12.27]They're here.
[78:19.02]I've even moved the thing!
[78:20.64]Uh, what?!
[78:21.96]I even moved- Ah, whatever.
[78:26.72]no way skill issue I'm too busy like doing like I tried to save you Jerma my enemies I'm radioactive radioactive every single person is my enemy
[78:58.60]What is that?
[79:08.62]Stop.
[79:12.57]I have Imagine Dragons on right now.
[79:17.09]I don't care.
[79:18.79]I'm not one of those banned elitists, right?
[79:21.87]I'm not going to be like, well...
[79:25.15]I have this indie band that I listen to that's better.
[79:27.83]I don't care.
[79:28.79]If you enjoy music, good.
[79:29.85]I hope you do.
[79:33.17]I don't listen to music.
[79:33.83]I don't really listen to it too much.
[79:35.29]I listen to like the Gorillaz albums on repeat.
[79:38.69]The Lost Odyssey soundtrack on repeat.
[79:43.29]Fullmetal Alchemist intro and outro.
[79:45.81]Brotherhood.
[79:47.56]Maybe like a dozen times a week.
[79:52.22]I used to be able to recite the entire Attack on Titan Season 2 intro until I was like, I probably should stop doing this because the YouTube algorithm is going to like, think I'm like a fucking weirdo.
[80:09.52]What was that sound?
[80:19.54]Why can I not hear him?
[80:22.92]Why are you making fun of Imagine Dragons?
[80:25.60]I just told you I didn't.
[80:26.84]I'm just saying.
[80:28.24]Those are the two songs that I know.
[80:29.62]I just said that music, if you have different music tastes, there's nothing wrong with it.
[80:36.71]I don't care.
[80:39.48]Okay, I feel the same.
[80:40.08]People used to give me shit about liking the Venom movie.
[80:42.55]Okay?
[80:43.79]Look, I... You know, dude, let me tell you something about why the Venom movie... I don't care if you don't like the Venom movie.
[80:49.29]It's working, Criken.
[80:50.17]I thought it was funny.
[80:51.43]I thought it was just, like, absurd.
[80:52.97]It was awful, but it was great at the same time.
[80:54.74]Who cares?
[80:55.64]Who doesn't matter?
[81:11.56]Nowhere in that whole thing did I say, I hate... We're going to avoid the clip.
[81:17.72]Nowhere during that entire segment did I say the words, I never said this.
[81:22.78]Hate never said this.
[81:23.75]Imagine Dragons never said it.
[81:28.41]All I said was... I just... I didn't even say anything.
[81:31.61]I just went... I'm not even going to say it again.
[81:42.59]I'm not kidding man I really thought something's wrong with my computer I thought something was wrong with my computer get out of my head
[82:07.73]Ignore Vinny.
[82:08.63]That's me.
[82:09.75]I thought there was something in this drink.
[82:13.31]I was like, what happened?
[82:14.51]What did I just take?
[82:15.37]I was like, why are there drugs in my drink?
[82:19.86]What's going on?
[82:20.50]I was like, what the fuck?
[82:24.34]It feels like the screen is wavy too.
[82:26.06]I'm just like, what's it?
[82:27.26]The macho... Alright, that is the most annoying fucking...
[82:40.21]So much matcha powder.
[82:41.93]I really think I'm going to select it next time.
[82:46.28]It's like this side effect of all the matcha powder.
[82:55.94]You know, I've learned that the ghost hunt was really about the friends we made.
[83:00.53]I died instantly.
[83:01.07]It wasn't so much about the actual ghost hunting.
[83:05.75]I was gone in the first probably five seconds.
[83:23.48]The misery!
[83:24.28]This motherfucker right here is my enemy!
[83:51.76]I'd like to dub this genre of game prop hunt with consequences.
[84:09.97]Oh shit, I just bumped into you!
[84:24.63]Oh, fuck.
[84:25.90]I was hoping Newtonian physics would win out.
[84:29.80]How do you even die in this?
[84:31.38]We can get killed in ghost mode?
[84:33.30]I was bumping into stuff.
[84:34.96]That room was a bad place to do that.
[84:36.06]We should have left.
[84:36.74]And on that map of all maps.
[84:38.70]We got consequenced.
[84:41.45]Yeah, I feel like you guys should have had a real advantage there.
[84:44.91]True life consequences.
[84:48.78]I slammed into something.
[84:50.14]Yeah, two ghosts.
[84:50.84]We smashed into it.
[84:51.64]It was two.
[84:52.86]I like the spooky ghost perk that's just there to fuck with the other team.
[84:58.08]I just was trying to be annoying.
[84:59.89]I hope it worked.
[85:01.87]Oh, trust me.
[85:02.53]It worked.
[85:03.75]It was soothing.
[85:04.51]I went to sleep.
[85:06.39]Leasing the Attack on Titan intro.
[85:11.02]Now you're really going to get like, are you kidding me?
[85:18.59]No.
[85:20.30]No way.
[85:22.26]No way.
[85:23.50]Not a chance in hell.
[85:24.60]No way.
[85:29.54]Hey.
[85:30.52]You like my outfit?
[85:31.96]Oh, it's a new... How much does it cost?
[85:36.63]$1,500.
[85:36.67]But it costs you your soul because you have to cook meth in Albuquerque to get it.
[85:42.31]Oh, that is a Jesse outfit.
[85:44.35]You're right.
[85:44.67]A little bit.
[85:50.02]That's two references to Breaking Bad tonight.
[85:52.28]It's just Jesse Jesse.
[85:53.98]Oh, yeah, it is a woman.
[85:54.84]I didn't realize that.
[85:55.60]You definitely have a bit of curves.
[86:00.44]What's the play here?
[86:01.71]We want to strategize a little bit.
[86:03.33]Should we do two and two?
[86:04.43]Two and two.
[86:07.83]I'll take the high road.
[86:09.21]I'll take the lower road.
[86:10.81]Okay.
[86:12.41]I'll take the Criken Road because I want to atone for my killing of the duck.
[86:19.89]All good.
[86:20.36]You can hold hands if you want.
[86:21.92]It looks like I'm the only one with a vacuum.
[86:26.00]I have the radar.
[86:28.60]Remember, you can switch mid-round at the desk.
[86:36.21]Grim, have you considered singing as a career?
[86:37.79]You have zoomer potential.
[86:39.09]I see one.
[86:39.93]What the fuck does that mean?
[86:42.07]I saw one.
[86:42.39]Did you see that?
[86:43.31]He was fucking running around upstairs.
[86:44.67]He's going up.
[86:45.13]He's going up top.
[86:54.46]Get his ass.
[86:57.82]I'll cover the down.
[87:00.72]Candles.
[87:01.22]Candles.
[87:02.62]Candles.
[87:03.12]Candles.
[87:04.24]Down here somewhere.
[87:06.14]Somewhere.
[87:07.52]Oh, ding.
[87:08.66]I'm not getting a reading.
[87:15.01]Yeah, they bailed.
[87:15.95]They booked it.
[87:17.35]There was something here.
[87:20.15]Someone in this room?
[87:23.49]There's a ghost here.
[87:24.21]Please make yourself known.
[87:29.30]Stone duck.
[87:30.58]I see that.
[87:31.52]You found your spirit animal.
[87:33.96]I mean, notice I find the duck in whatever map we're in.
[87:42.04]Got him right here.
[87:42.90]On me.
[87:45.42]He's a barrel with candles.
[87:48.79]Oh, he changed.
[87:49.29]He changed.
[87:49.73]He switched.
[87:50.23]I don't know.
[87:50.69]I don't know.
[87:51.21]I don't know.
[87:51.55]I don't know.
[87:51.83]I don't know.
[87:53.03]Candle.
[87:53.53]Candle.
[87:56.35]Fake she says.
[87:58.49]Up top.
[87:58.77]Up top.
[87:59.03]Up top.
[88:00.50]Another barrel of candles.
[88:02.61]Coming down.
[88:03.05]Barrel of candles.
[88:05.67]Going into the undercrop.
[88:13.99]I'm down.
[88:18.38]There's all this shit in the way.
[88:19.50]Down, down, down, down.
[88:22.78]Down is candles.
[88:24.04]Is candle.
[88:26.50]That was a headshot.
[88:27.25]What?
[88:30.85]They won't go back.
[88:31.87]Nice.
[88:33.59]Good work.
[88:34.73]Somebody else down here.
[88:35.41]At least it looked like it.
[88:48.80]Yeah, my reading is going off the charts over here.
[89:01.72]Maybe they went up.
[89:09.80]I heard... Might be up.
[89:20.30]Yeah, I think they might be up.
[89:27.76]Oh, this is just misery.
[89:30.64]The thing is that they're the enemy though, so we gotta make sure we take them out.
[89:33.44]I don't think anybody can fucking hear me.
[89:35.66]I'm too far away.
[89:47.93]No more ding.
[89:48.43]I don't think there's anybody on the roof.
[89:53.05]Two left.
[89:57.39]I'll check the crypts.
[89:59.19]The stone duck moved.
[90:00.51]What the fuck was that?
[90:02.75]What was that?
[90:12.83]We still have activity in this region.
[90:15.41]Somebody bumped into me.
[90:17.50]There's a thing on the lantern over here.
[90:20.44]I don't know.
[90:20.72]Somebody threw that at me.
[90:22.90]No way.
[90:28.50]Yeah, somebody threw that at me.
[90:30.76]And it's pissing me off.
[90:32.62]Yeah, we've got activity here.
[90:34.62]And it's... Ding.
[90:38.04]Ding once if you're alive.
[90:42.26]Ding once.
[90:43.64]Push.
[90:46.18]Come push me.
[90:46.96]Yeah, there's activity.
[90:49.05]Can they be up on this lip?
[90:54.47]This is not the real she says.
[90:55.83]Gas can.
[90:56.41]Help me shoot this she says.
[91:05.70]Yeah.
[91:06.74]Nice work.
[91:08.82]One left.
[91:11.39]We got 30 seconds.
[91:16.77]If you're a ghost with the most, just press the V button.
[91:22.25]Ghost, press the V button and that'll help you.
[91:27.30]This level is really good for ghosts.
[91:29.38]There's a lot of room.
[91:37.93]I don't know.
[91:39.09]In life, were you an animator?
[91:40.41]It's midnight.
[91:42.41]I'm gonna stay perched.
[91:50.22]Fuck.
[92:01.30]Oh, my God.

[92:29.34]I have weapons.
[92:30.26]Dog shit.
[92:30.90]I'm just using default.
[92:32.46]Oh, okay.
[92:34.12]Ding.
[92:35.20]And it just is your Twitch avatar, right?
[92:38.73]A bad craftsman blames the tools.
[92:43.56]A bad craftsman blames a seven damage sniper when the exploding splash damage five per clip bomb weapon does like 30.
[92:53.26]Isseri!
[93:09.98]I want to do this.
[93:12.44]I think fly, because you can fly.
[93:14.12]That's, yeah, I want to do that.
[93:16.98]Alright, that was a good round, but let's go for it.
[93:28.77]There's some really good ghost skins.
[93:30.95]Like, they're expensive as fuck, but there's some really fun ones.
[93:33.83]Gotta look at them.
[93:34.81]I like the but the grim reaper one I Think I'm gonna be that one's cool.
[93:40.64]I just like the classic ghost with sheet America statue Should I do door again or is that uh?
[93:48.98]No way it works twice.
[93:51.04]I think it will work again Yeah, it's just uh when the right mind would be a door for five minutes I

[94:44.84]Vinny's doing the duck.
[94:47.02]Self-report.
[94:55.93]I'm beginning to... I'm beginning to think I'm bad at this game.
[95:03.72]Can I talk or will they hear me?
[95:07.16]I think you're good if you press Q. Yeah, I... Do you see my 100 million IQ spot here?
[95:18.97]I'm going to take a look.
[95:22.83]Guys, I accidentally sprayed my spray right next to my door.
[95:27.84]That's cool.
[95:29.44]If they see it, it's a very clear giveaway.
[95:34.14]You're just the door.
[95:35.20]I literally put my own face on the door.
[95:38.79]That's a good spot.
[95:41.01]That's a good spot.
[95:49.91]And it stretched, Criken, like across.
[95:54.53]It's really cool looking.
[95:55.43]He sees it.
[95:55.89]There's no way they'd find me.
[95:56.85]Is he gonna... This is riveting gameplay.
[96:03.64]This is called winning gameplay because there's no fucking way anyone's gonna come over here.
[96:07.84]Like, why would you come over here?
[96:11.58]What the fuck?
[96:16.42]Did they really not?
[96:17.95]Yeah, they didn't.
[96:18.47]They just went, okay, and they went through the door.
[96:20.95]I really hope none of them try to close the door.
[96:22.97]I'm going to have to do that myself.
[96:24.37]Alright, we're good.
[96:28.51]Long time fan.
[96:28.99]I want to tell you that your title sucks.
[96:30.33]I don't even know what the title is.
[96:43.64]I'm dinging.
[96:44.80]We've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.
[96:49.47]They're never gonna find me, no way.
[96:50.91]No fucking way.
[96:51.49]This is the best spot of the whole day.
[97:20.04]I think I can move a little.
[97:21.65]Clear the build up.
[97:22.49]Oh my fucking god, they're up there.
[97:38.84]There's no way.
[97:39.50]No, there's no fucking way they're gonna come over.
[97:43.87]I am in the clear.
[98:08.93]I am never going to be found.
[98:10.91]But wait, that means I have to kill everybody.
[98:20.76]Throw your voice.
[98:21.50]It was shift C?
[98:26.43]Hold shift and press C?
[98:39.57]Does that work?
[98:45.47]Is this working?
[99:12.67]Weird noise.
[99:17.78]Is that?
[99:19.20]Why do I hear the head?
[99:24.83]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[99:38.31]I... Oh, I fucked up.
[100:08.35]This reminds me of Bugs Life when the ants stand up to the grasshoppers.
[100:14.40]It's like, we're not as big of a threat as they thought.
[100:16.06]I haven't thought of that in a very long time.
[100:22.14]The shotgun's insane.
[100:24.16]We're still hiding from them now.
[100:29.23]Go, Gascan!
[100:30.79]Gascan, you got this.
[100:45.05]How the heck is he flying like that?
[100:49.55]Holy shit.
[100:57.77]What a magnificent legstand.
[100:59.39]I was trying to... I was holding the button down.
[101:08.90]I was holding right click.
[101:09.76]I know you could throw your body at him and hit him in the fucking head.
[101:12.14]I couldn't hit him in the fucking head though.
[101:14.44]No, you can like slash at people if you didn't know.
[101:17.37]Oh.
[101:18.51]It kills almost instantly.
[101:21.51]Does it really?
[101:22.01]I wouldn't say instantly.
[101:25.03]I was trying that too and I was not doing enough damage.
[101:27.65]It did 98 damage to me in one hit.
[101:30.27]Yeah, he's pretty low.
[101:34.60]I was trying to hit him in the fucking head.
[101:37.54]I know you can fucking hit him in the fucking head.
[101:43.27]Alright, now that I know, okay, now that I know that, I can do it.
[101:58.59]Give me this goddamn thing.
[102:01.69]What's up, guys?
[102:04.77]How are you doing that?
[102:08.33]Vocal training.
[102:10.96]Imagine somebody could do that.
[102:13.22]By a fucking sledgehammer.
[102:15.36]Secret vocal technique.
[102:21.80]I guess we'll do these teams.
[102:25.40]I'm sorry.
[102:26.72]Someone in my chat just said Vinny annoys his friends all night.
[102:30.56]I don't think it's annoying.
[102:31.30]I think it's cool.
[102:33.06]I think you're great, man.
[102:33.88]Can I do frostbite?
[102:36.10]How about this?
[102:38.77]I think that's great, too.
[102:39.73]You know, in fact, we're going to prom right now.
[102:43.59]That's pretty touching.
[102:45.75]Yeah, I think we're all each other's dates.
[102:49.35]Alright, cool.
[102:49.83]I'm very excited.
[102:50.99]I'm going to cook some meth at the prom.
[102:52.79]You guys can light the place on fire.
[102:55.31]Yeah, you should spike the fruit punch with meth.
[102:57.84]Oh, I don't know, Mr. White.
[103:05.13]I'm happy I got Jerma to hear.
[103:16.15]I got to hear Jerma do a Walter White impression.
[103:24.58]It's really easy.
[103:27.06]Just do Harrison Ford, but say Jesse.
[103:33.55]Chewie.
[103:34.25]I mean Jesse.
[103:35.35]We're home.
[103:36.96]You got it.
[103:37.42]That was perfect.
[103:47.22]Ding once for yes and none for no.
[103:51.26]Is your name Jolly?
[103:55.89]Why is it moving?
[103:57.53]Is your name Rubber Ross?
[104:05.04]Alright, never mind.
[104:05.72]It's not Ross.
[104:07.76]Yo, is that a Hulk?
[104:10.68]Hulk's ass?
[104:10.98]There's a little Hulk figure in there.
[104:13.96]There's somebody in the, uh, ballroom area.
[104:18.34]You okay?
[104:18.88]What the fuck?
[104:19.60]I don't know.
[104:19.96]I just, like, I don't know.
[104:24.26]A percussion instrument.
[104:26.88]Oh, like, there's someone in the, uh, in the dance hall.
[104:36.97]Oh, he scared me.
[104:37.57]That's a good one.
[104:46.36]I don't have a gun.
[104:52.56]I'm trying to shoot him with the ice pellets.
[104:54.34]Well, we're all bad at this.
[104:56.90]I got science lab.
[105:01.71]There is a weird teleporter in here though.
[105:03.45]Oh, it's a bouncy pad.
[105:08.67]I'll see him.
[105:12.22]Ding once if your name is Jolly Wankor.
[105:20.14]Yeah, she says your shaggy voice is unreal.
[105:24.84]Thank you.
[105:25.76]Here, let me try one more time.
[105:29.09]Like Swing Scoop?
[105:30.47]Like we're at the prom?
[105:32.43]That's pretty good.
[105:34.45]Raggy!
[105:39.30]That's a really good one.
[105:40.36]Can I say sorry?
[105:41.32]Can anyone here do scrappy do and get banned?
[105:44.09]I should probably apologize.
[105:45.29]Is it time for an apology for you?
[105:47.27]I don't know.
[105:48.15]I'm not sure.
[105:49.13]Yeah, you get banned from the server and Twitch, unfortunately.
[105:52.31]It's in their rules now.
[105:53.91]Somebody's in here.
[105:54.59]Somebody's a chair or something.
[106:04.12]I think we have a ghost in the punch bowl.
[106:07.32]Oh, I hope we do.
[106:11.11]That's not the real Criken.
[106:13.53]What?
[106:14.55]What?
[106:14.83]No?
[106:16.03]That was fake Criken.
[106:22.94]I got the defibrillator.
[106:23.84]There's me.
[106:24.38]Hold on.
[106:31.90]Thankfully, it's right in the face.
[106:32.98]It's me?
[106:34.24]Oh no.
[106:35.82]A bomb in the lasagna.
[106:36.92]I am 100% being a toilet.
[106:38.26]Yeah, that wasn't Criken.
[106:39.18]That was Krakened.
[106:42.99]There's no way I'm not gonna be a toilet next round.
[106:47.29]There's no activity here at all.
[106:48.63]Zero, zero.
[106:51.45]Roger, Roger.
[107:00.02]I mean, my icon is Nirvana, so... There's a song from Nirvana called School.
[107:05.70]Anyone know that song?
[107:09.72]Yep.
[107:10.87]Yeah.
[107:11.57]That's this right now.
[107:13.70]So true.
[107:14.42]Oh, interesting.
[107:16.42]Can I get some friends to come over to the stage, please?
[107:23.96]Oh, no.
[107:24.38]Couldn't find me, Squid Game-looking idiot.
[107:26.44]Did you just call me an idiot?
[107:29.84]In Squid Game.
[107:31.63]He's a guitar, guitar, guitar, guitar.
[107:34.41]If you're...
[107:49.34]we tried in here dude I am such a okay I cannot use this next time I'm just staring at the meter and not looking at what it's pointing at there's a ding right here we got a ding and I I don't even trash he was trash it was liam he was trash
[108:19.00]Oh, fuck.
[108:25.47]Oh, heck.
[108:25.91]Oh, heck.
[108:26.43]Oh, my God, Lois.
[108:31.11]I thought, you know, was jolly.
[108:34.65]Dude, this gun sucks, too.
[108:37.55]Damn it.
[108:38.54]Are there any weapons that are good besides the first one?
[108:43.44]I haven't found one yet.
[108:45.87]ding liam I thought it was jolly dinging the whole time oh no yeah I was I was a trash can in the hallway well you figured it out yeah use a shotgun yeah I was and then I was a drum kit before then you walked by me a lot I think also let's for tonight my goal is for us to see every map at least once so I think we I think we only have one more after this to be fair
[109:14.20]Okay.
[109:15.06]This is probably a bad idea, but let's see what happens.
[109:19.20]Whatever.
[109:19.46]People think I'm like a cringy, annoying loser anyways.
[109:22.26]I'm going for it.
[109:29.72]This one's better.
[109:30.60]I like this actually way more.
[109:35.18]I put Shove Hunter.
[109:36.24]Yeah.
[109:36.62]To be fair, someone was saying...
[109:40.76]Probably the other team.
[109:43.62]You guys want to all at the same time do a Peter Griffin impression at the count of three?
[109:47.72]Yeah, let's do it.
[109:48.58]You think so?
[109:48.90]You think it's worth it?
[109:49.86]What are we saying?
[109:50.88]I'd love to.
[109:52.04]Yeah, we're going to say the same thing too?
[109:53.54]Yeah, the exact same thing.
[109:55.58]Okay, what is it?
[109:58.89]This reminds me of the time that I went to the school dance, Lois.
[110:02.89]Yeah.
[110:03.54]You ready?
[110:04.84]Yeah.
[110:05.71]In one, two, three.
[110:08.71]I feel like I'm the weak link there, guys.
[110:16.05]I gotta be honest.
[110:18.25]I couldn't tell because it was just a cacophony of Peter's.
[110:22.51]That's like we all so badly wanted to make the same joke and we did it at the same time.
[110:29.70]I mean, you told us to.
[110:31.26]Yeah, but, like, out of context, though, like, we all so badly wanted to make the Peter Griffin reference at the school dance.
[110:39.44]And all happened to say the same exact line.
[110:42.26]It was a very memorable quote.
[110:44.52]We could probably get Ross and his friend Don to animate it.
[110:48.16]But, yeah, I'm sure he would love to do that.
[110:56.58]Wait, I have not moved.
[110:58.46]I was too busy focusing on Peter Griffin.
[111:00.50]I'm the fucking mic in the middle of the dance floor.
[111:04.31]Not a good place to be.
[111:05.43]I mean, but you are an important tool of the dance.
[111:09.67]Without you, how would we hear the vocals?
[111:12.69]Yeah, whenever they come close, I'm gonna say Peter Griffin line.
[111:19.32]Okay, remember, you can throw your voice.
[111:23.00]I'm going to throw it right behind them, and they're going to turn around, and then I'll run.
[111:26.09]Yeah, how far can you throw it?
[111:27.33]Just as far as you can see?
[111:28.21]I believe so.
[111:29.55]Yeah, it's a little pinpoint when you do it.
[111:31.73]You hold control and C. So it's control and C. What was that cool noise?
[111:37.77]I heard it sound like Chewbacca.
[111:42.10]I hate that noise.
[111:43.00]I hate that noise.
[112:00.71]That's probably fucking scary.
[112:08.02]Gemma, the fact you aren't the fucking bowl of Cheetos is a crime.
[112:14.32]Wait, you think I'm a bowl of Cheetos?
[113:00.90]Screw them.
[113:01.34]I'm a big man.
[113:03.78]I'm staying right here.
[113:24.81]You Stewie?
[113:36.58]You're not throwing it?
[113:37.50]Shift and C. Look.
[113:40.96]I can see it over there.
[113:42.80]That's what I'm doing the whole time.
[113:44.04]Look, you can see the indicator.
[113:44.96]Shift C. That's what I'm doing.
[113:51.89]I've been doing it the whole time.
[113:57.37]This is now just spooky Family Guy.
[113:59.21]I'm over here.
[114:02.97]I'm over here, here, here.
[114:04.35]I'm over here, here, here.
[114:05.70]I love it.
[114:27.37]Alright.
[114:56.82]I feel like I have the best hiding spot.
[114:58.62]Like I haven't seen anybody come over here.
[115:01.82]They all just like hanging out in the, uh, the actual dance hall.
[115:04.90]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[115:18.15]Oh my God.
[115:18.89]Hunters.
[115:19.57]You think you're going to find it?
[115:31.52]I need to live!
[115:32.26]I need to live!
[116:00.51]Come on, you fucking consumerists.
[116:12.98]C4?
[116:15.00]I got insta-killed.
[116:15.98]I got one.
[116:22.37]It's just me.
[116:22.91]I forgot you can attack.
[116:24.17]Fuck.
[116:26.85]Why is it consumerists?
[116:28.27]I don't know.
[116:31.64]It's crazy to me you can survive the entire round and then die in one hit.
[116:34.84]Yeah.
[116:39.89]I gotta remember to actually attack with right click.
[116:42.53]I've been headshotting people with the furniture.
[116:46.57]Yeah, that's more fun.
[116:48.95]Yeah, and also in some ways less risky because you're going fast.
[116:59.47]diaper chief stop it how do you get that pose it's an emote or no it's a victory pose I don't know almost killed me with the sheer force of his launch that was pretty cool yeah you had 10 uh health left let us uh exit the server and do one more uh map perhaps with one more change of team
[117:24.62]Should we change the join order?
[117:25.80]Because that seems to be what the teams are.
[117:27.68]Yeah, let's try that.
[117:28.54]We can organize it.
[117:29.64]We can like decide who goes when.
[117:33.52]Consumerist.
[117:37.55]I don't know.
[117:37.83]We're like in all these objects like basketballs and like like keyboards and like computers.
[117:44.29]I don't know.
[117:46.13]I figured it'd be like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[117:47.91]Like they're running around chasing this ghost who is a chair.
[117:50.87]And he's like, you fucking consumerist.
[117:52.31]It's like
[117:54.10]What are you talking about?
[117:54.82]What does that have to do with anything?
[118:06.93]You're an object.
[118:08.63]Yeah, I know.
[118:09.25]I'm like a piano.
[118:11.97]He's so high.
[118:12.77]You keep talking in team chat.
[118:27.66]Oh, that was the time that I played golf.
[118:31.44]I'm having fun.
[118:32.14]This is fun.
[118:37.14]Yeah, I was throwing my voice.
[118:38.18]I was throwing it all.
[118:39.20]That was a really good round during the hiding phase.
[118:41.06]I think we're going to wait until a couple people join so the teams are more scrambled.
[118:59.16]I think he's actually high.
[119:00.38]I'm not.
[119:01.38]I'm just having a good time.
[119:16.13]Don't ever bet on Jerma's team.
[119:17.51]We've won a few.
[119:23.06]I'm going to join now.
[119:32.09]And joining.
[119:34.07]Oh, that lobby doesn't exist.
[119:39.78]What are the animes that you've watched?
[119:42.34]I like the kind of mainstream ones.
[119:43.92]Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist.
[119:54.02]Jujutsu Kaisen.
[119:55.96]I don't think I finished that one.
[120:02.32]I've not seen JoJo, no.
[120:08.07]That's pretty much it, though.
[120:09.95]I've seen Berserk a long time ago.
[120:13.27]What about Mohg?
[120:13.87]I don't think it's an anime.
[120:17.93]Brotherhood or the original?
[120:18.79]I've seen both.
[120:20.89]One Punch Man?
[120:21.37]I've seen season one of One Punch Man.
[120:24.34]And I've been told just pretend that it ends at season one.
[120:31.30]Mob Psycho?
[120:31.92]No.
[120:36.16]Cowboy Bebop, long time ago.
[120:42.06]Oh, I don't have the code.
[120:44.86]What about Evangelion?
[120:47.10]I've seen the final scene of Evangelion.
[120:49.78]That's it, though.
[120:51.50]Maybe, like, randomly on Adult Swim, if it used to play.
[120:53.72]Okay, here we go.
[120:59.70]Please watch Mob Psycho.
[121:01.35]I don't have, like, a plan.
[121:02.09]I don't really have a plan of, like, watching certain animes or whatever.
[121:09.08]Um, I just kind of catch them if I, you know, feel like it one day.
[121:11.06]What about One Piece?
[121:19.65]Um, I, okay, this is probably going to piss a lot of people off.
[121:22.77]Well, not really piss you off, but be like, oh, dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[121:25.93]I watched, like, the first, like, season, I think, of One Piece when the intro had, yeah, yo, yeah, yo, in it.
[121:34.74]Um, so, that's all I know.
[121:44.01]The four kids version.
[121:49.75]Yeah, whatever one goes, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up.
[121:54.98]Here's how the story goes.
[121:56.12]It's no doubt from the treasure in the grand line.
[121:58.30]It's no doubt.
[121:59.30]We want to be king.
[122:01.10]I be king of the island.
[122:02.20]He wants to be king.
[122:03.48]Yayo, yayo.
[122:06.29]Don't give it up, Luffy.
[122:08.21]Don't give it up, Zolo.
[122:10.23]Don't give it up.
[122:11.47]Not up.
[122:12.66]Don't give, give it up, give it, I don't, I know like most of it.
[122:19.70]Oh, uh, dude, yeah, he, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, just go bite a gum gum.
[122:25.84]And then, yeah, yo, yeah, he spins around with his legs.
[122:28.10]I don't know why I remember this whole thing.
[122:33.94]I don't understand.
[122:41.19]Why do I know the 4Kids dub?
[122:43.15]Because like 15 years ago it was just on TV randomly sometimes.
[122:55.40]Sub or dub?
[122:56.44]I mean if it's the 4Kids version from like almost two decades ago it's gonna be the dub.
[123:05.94]I keep forgetting you're not 20.
[123:10.27]Yeah, that means you watched the four kids one in your 20s.
[123:13.77]Listen to me.
[123:14.48]I did not tell you that I watched.
[123:16.58]I'm just telling you.
[123:17.44]Sometimes it was on TV and like I'd catch the intro and be like, oh, OK, this is a show, I guess.
[123:22.74]And then like and change the fucking channel.
[123:27.14]I don't know.
[123:27.56]I don't know the whole series.
[123:29.18]Hi.
[123:37.04]Hello.
[123:38.56]Hello.
[123:38.72]Oh, hi.
[123:39.74]You guys ready to rock and roll?
[123:41.72]Let's do it.
[123:42.19]Hello.
[123:42.55]Yeah.
[123:42.85]You said you watched the first season.
[123:44.49]I mean, what I meant by that is I've seen episodes from like the first season because it would randomly be on television.
[123:51.55]Alright, what's the strat?
[123:54.42]What do you guys want to do?
[123:57.34]I'm going to be a door.
[123:59.40]Oh, yeah.
[124:03.19]I'm 24 and I watched it on TV.
[124:05.41]Yeah, whatever.
[124:07.96]Sorry guys, I didn't come across One Piece, the four kids version when I was like fucking 20 and go, No, no, I'm 20.
[124:18.01]I can't watch this.
[124:18.87]Like, I just like, I don't know.
[124:20.09]It was on fucking TV.
[124:26.66]My only concern is that I can't jump to reduce the ectoplasm, so I don't know what the strategy is.
[124:32.49]Ding.
[124:33.15]You ding.
[124:34.47]Oh, I ding?
[124:35.73]Guys, I don't know what happens in this show.
[124:38.29]I have no idea.
[124:39.01]Your prop doesn't shake, and the ding is way off in the distance for some reason.
[124:43.68]This is actually, like, this is evil.
[124:47.16]It's genuinely bastard.
[124:48.28]I'm 24, and I still watch the Care Bears.
[124:49.92]Leave him alone.
[125:00.49]You browse television.
[125:03.03]Sorry.
[125:03.77]By the way, guys, I'm old enough for when, like, I had to change channels to watch TV shows.
[125:09.96]I had to go like this.
[125:12.44]and see what the fuck was on TV.
[125:15.64]They have a footstep thing.
[125:16.66]I didn't open an app.
[125:18.06]I didn't open an application and just pick any TV show I've ever wanted to watch and watch it.
[125:22.51]No, we had to scroll.
[125:23.75]We had to scroll through our TV stations.
[125:26.93]I mean, I guess we did kind of a great job.
[125:28.49]That makes no sense, though.
[125:29.89]We don't even use our feet.
[125:32.59]That's true.
[125:35.17]Yeah, it's probably just not optimized.
[125:38.65]Those of you guys that remember, going to the TV Guide channel and watching the scroll, the like one mile per hour scroll, of waiting to see what the fuck was on Cartoon Network.
[125:51.35]Ding ding ding ding, it's this guy.
[125:52.83]Ding ding ding ding.
[125:57.27]See ya fuckin' later.
[125:58.61]Oh my god, why did I, what happened?
[126:05.20]I made it!
[126:06.44]Oh, wow, there's an achievement for taunting 25 times in one game.
[126:10.00]Yeah.
[126:10.63]There used to be a channel on TV.
[126:12.87]Do you guys remember the TV guy channel where you had to literally, the shit scrolled and you had to see what was on TV?
[126:19.30]No, I'm not 45 years old.
[126:20.78]Why do you ask?
[126:21.70]Whoa.
[126:22.92]Because it used to be like that, right?
[126:25.38]I apologize.
[126:28.40]My family had those TV guide magazines.
[126:32.22]It was a terrible time.
[126:33.30]And you had to look through.
[126:34.52]You had to find what was going to be on TV on Thursday.
[126:37.36]I don't know why this matters.
[126:43.05]Who cares?
[126:43.85]But apparently it does.
[126:44.87]Literally, all it was was just for me to figure out when reruns of The Simpsons were on.
[126:48.27]Wow.
[126:49.49]Literally the most interesting conversation I've had all night, Jerma, so don't worry about it.
[126:55.20]Oh, my.
[127:05.05]Possess!
[127:05.71]Possess!
[127:11.61]One day they'll figure out that you can shoot the doors.
[127:14.17]By the way, you can close and open your door.
[127:17.53]So just close and open your door all the time.
[127:20.94]What button is that?
[127:22.64]Oh fuck, oh fuck, I'm going this way.
[127:23.78]Go back.
[127:24.36]Oh my god, they're coming up here.
[127:25.16]Right click.
[127:26.60]I need to get the fuck through this door now.
[127:31.48]This is awesome.
[127:35.13]Fuck, I wanted to be that phone.
[127:36.29]Remember, it doesn't clear your ectoplasm, so you also got a ding.
[127:38.79]I, uh, I lost.
[127:41.75]Uh-oh.
[127:54.64]I may have taken there.
[127:58.22]Oh, shit.
[128:07.88]I have medium ability, but I can't area talk for some reason.
[128:12.22]Yayo, yayo.
[128:15.76]I'm sorry.
[128:20.10]Hello, punters?
[128:21.00]Can you hear me?
[128:24.41]Give it up, Luffy.
[128:26.51]Give it up, Solo.
[128:32.39]Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up.
[128:37.61]Here's how the story goes.
[128:38.63]It's no doubt with the treasure in the grand line.
[128:40.67]It's no doubt.
[128:53.03]I'll be king of the pirates.
[128:56.82]I'm gonna be king.
[129:03.06]I'm throwing it over there.
[129:04.94]I gotta get out of here though.
[129:10.37]You fell for it.
[129:10.79]You fell for it.
[129:11.31]You fell for it.
[129:11.81]You fell for it.
[129:12.35]You fell for it.
[129:12.85]You fell for it.
[129:13.17]You fell for it.
[129:20.41]I got a good spot.
[129:23.83]They learned.
[129:25.25]No, I hit them with a duel.
[129:26.69]I saw that.
[129:29.41]And then they may have, they may have become wise to my rules at that point.
[129:33.98]Alright, Jerma.
[129:34.50]It's on you.
[129:35.00]Let's see what I can do.
[129:35.98]I'm going for it.
[129:44.47]Oh, never mind.
[129:45.11]We can all kill them now.
[129:46.13]Yeah, let's go for a quick kill.
[129:57.58]Jesus.
[130:01.36]No.
[130:04.74]Nice job.
[130:05.18]Oh, no.
[130:07.42]Good game.
[130:07.70]Good game.
[130:07.96]Good game.
[130:12.68]Criken, I watched as a ghost objected you in the back of the skull.
[130:17.54]It was awful.
[130:18.04]Why did none of you attack the door?
[130:20.53]Like, I was hitting people with the door.
[130:22.87]I don't know, sometimes they're useful.
[130:26.61]I don't know, randomly, like, I just hit the voice chat button and I ask a stupid question.
[130:31.70]You guys remember having breakfast?
[130:33.96]Let's do a Peter Griffin impression.
[130:35.06]It's like, I'm like a fucking soundboard.
[130:37.02]Yeah, I was going to say that as well.
[130:43.82]I'll be king of the pirates.
[130:45.30]I want to be king.
[130:52.04]I like that loadout.
[130:52.72]It's fun.
[130:53.24]Actually, no, I don't.
[130:53.90]Give me this regular weapon.
[130:56.92]Alright, let's do it.
[130:59.49]Let's take him out.
[131:02.73]That was a good strategy, Jerma.
[131:04.67]Hey, Jerma.
[131:06.17]Watch the floor.
[131:09.43]What's going on?
[131:11.91]I'm spraying the floor and it looks like a light show.
[131:14.16]Oh, that's a spray.
[131:17.96]Yeah.
[131:18.06]You use the Z key.
[131:22.40]What is it?
[131:22.70]Does it spray your Steam, like, avatar?
[131:25.87]Yeah.
[131:26.83]That's what it says.
[131:27.29]Aim it at the roof.
[131:28.01]It's just... Oh yeah, the roof.
[131:30.75]Oh, that's not bad.
[131:31.51]Okay.
[131:35.91]Alone in the dark.
[131:45.36]This is fun.
[131:45.72]I like how you had the basic strategy of just kill them fast and we did it.
[131:49.44]Yeah, just swarm.
[131:50.84]I think the swarm actually makes more sense.
[131:52.62]Just everybody come out of their furniture and just go.
[131:55.33]Right click, right click, right click.
[131:56.37]Just swarm them.
[131:59.39]Jermall, we're hunting the ghosts this round.
[132:03.08]Oh yeah, but I mean when we were ghosts.
[132:05.94]Oh yeah, okay.
[132:06.62]But I mean, we also die like crazy when people swarm as humans, too.
[132:09.81]It's... I think when you're ghost, you're supposed to catch them.
[132:12.93]You're still supposed to catch them by surprise, because if you're getting close, you just fucking wreck them.
[132:18.35]Yeah, just like 50 damage a swing.
[132:19.91]That's kind of insane.
[132:20.97]Yeah.
[132:24.05]By the way, if you have C4, use it in the final end round, and it just eviscerates them.
[132:29.72]It insta-kills them.
[132:30.56]Okay.
[132:37.23]I wish we could throw our voices as the humans.
[132:40.36]I think there's something up here.
[132:48.06]Where are you at?
[132:50.96]Upstairs.
[132:51.80]It's like orange.
[132:53.97]Jolly, over by you.
[132:56.33]Gotcha.
[132:56.55]I'm coming to you.
[133:00.73]Got him.
[133:01.55]Can somebody back you?
[133:02.25]Nice.
[133:05.20]I can do that.
[133:06.40]I'll go get one.
[133:08.58]We only really need one person with a vacuum.
[133:10.98]And someone's got it?
[133:12.06]Yeah, yeah, I got it.
[133:13.24]I'm like Luigi right now.
[133:15.40]Alright, we got Luigi.
[133:17.11]Upstairs seems pretty clear for the moment, for the time being.
[133:23.91]Who just did that?
[133:25.97]He's a fan.
[133:26.75]Check it.
[133:33.48]Who was doing that?
[133:34.06]Who was talking on the ghost team?
[133:35.74]You need to shut the fuck up.
[133:36.76]When you said he was a fan, I thought you were making fun of fans.
[133:43.25]Well, now he's a wheelchair.
[133:44.89]I don't want to make fun of wheelchairs.
[133:46.37]And now he's dead.
[133:46.85]No, do it.
[133:47.35]Do it.
[133:48.49]No longer a fan of yours.
[133:49.75]No, I don't think I will.
[133:51.49]Whoever on the ghost team is talking right now, you need to shut the fuck up.
[134:08.35]Somebody's up here.
[134:16.86]It's going crazy.
[134:17.64]Do you have the radar too, Jerma?
[134:18.98]I do, yeah.
[134:19.60]Alright, I see it too.
[134:22.74]I guess you're supposed to start shooting stuff, I guess.
[134:25.48]I don't know.
[134:28.37]I would be the bathtub.
[134:29.13]If it was me.
[134:41.89]This is like the reverse of that Black Mesa bit.
[134:44.93]Somebody's in here.
[134:47.24]Oh, I think I found him.
[134:49.46]There we go.
[134:53.84]I got the vacuum.
[134:56.84]Okay, I actually don't have the vacuum.
[134:59.18]I don't have a vacuum either.
[135:01.00]I'll get it.
[135:02.58]Oh, sorry.
[135:03.04]I was distracted.
[135:03.80]Should I guard this here?
[135:07.33]Yeah, that probably would be a good idea.
[135:08.47]Alright, we're good.
[135:13.21]Awesome.
[135:14.20]You guys got any activity over there?
[135:24.52]I'm going back over here.
[135:31.59]Yeah.
[135:32.33]Yeah.
[135:33.39]Okay.
[135:33.69]Come on, Gwen.
[135:34.45]Really?
[135:36.57]Yeah.
[135:36.75]Come on, Gwen.
[135:37.67]Where are you?
[135:39.63]Okay.
[135:39.83]You find anything, Jeremiah?
[135:41.24]I think there's somebody up here.
[135:42.48]It's going crazy right here.
[135:46.40]Hold on.
[135:46.72]I'm on my way.
[135:50.36]Try the doors.
[135:52.02]Yeah, the doors.
[136:00.10]Could be below.
[136:00.96]Yeah, could be below.
[136:01.72]This is going crazy.
[136:02.32]The meter's going crazy.
[136:03.02]Okay.
[136:08.18]Oh, there's a whole basement.
[136:09.48]You should shoot the microwave a couple more times.
[136:11.72]No, where's it at?
[136:14.24]In the basement.
[136:15.84]Ah, shoot.
[136:16.24]I should have known.
[136:19.52]Sorry, I'm not good with directions.
[136:26.63]Maybe it is the basement.
[136:29.99]Whoever's on the ghost team right now, like, just talking, needs to shut the fuck up.
[136:32.65]49 seconds.
[136:36.03]I don't know who you're talking about.
[136:37.47]I'm just trying to live my life the best I can.
[136:42.72]I don't think I'm annoying or anything like that.
[136:45.96]Where is... I don't know.
[136:47.36]Imagine being like that pissed.
[136:51.76]It's like... Whoever on the ghost team.
[136:57.26]Very good.
[136:58.69]It's I. Bane Griffin.
[137:02.51]Lois.
[137:09.55]Where are you?
[137:11.19]How can you be so clear but so far away at the same time?
[137:14.11]I don't understand.
[137:14.85]I don't understand.
[137:18.39]How could you be so clear?
[137:19.29]Is that a real person?
[137:29.06]Okay.
[137:29.30]Alright, watch out.
[137:29.78]Bench.
[137:30.02]Bench.
[137:31.62]There's one in the hallway, dude.
[137:34.44]He just went down the stairs.
[137:45.44]He's a little fucking frying pan.
[137:47.22]Damn it, I didn't get out the door in time.
[137:49.92]Oh, he was a frying pan.
[137:56.44]He was so small.
[137:57.32]Hey, where's all the ghosting?
[138:00.26]Just shut the fuck up right now.
[138:07.68]Nice duck.
[138:08.16]Where'd you get a duck?
[138:09.61]Nice.
[138:09.75]You got a duck, what?
[138:10.31]That's a great duck there.
[138:11.89]Yeah, I got to duck him out.
[138:12.65]He's a fridge.
[138:14.23]I like the fridge.
[138:18.95]It didn't do me no good.
[138:20.61]Well, I'm just imagining being on the ghost team and hearing in the distance kind of footsteps and being like, you know, what was the ghost team doing?
[138:27.93]Fuck up.
[138:29.43]It's just like, wow.
[138:31.88]Psycho, like relax.
[138:32.68]If you lads would like, we can do one more.
[138:34.78]If not, I have no problem with calling it here.
[138:38.38]I'm down with whatever.
[138:39.62]I'm having a lot of fun.
[138:40.24]This is great.
[138:40.68]Yeah, I can go another.
[138:59.96]Alright, this is going to be a good one here.
[139:03.30]I think I wanted to do copy.
[139:04.42]That sounds fun.
[139:11.91]Oh, back at the museum level.
[139:13.79]I feel like the museum is hard for the ghost because everything is in such proximity.
[139:24.65]Jeremy, I have an idea.
[139:25.44]Follow me.
[139:26.06]I'm behind you.
[139:28.34]Okay.
[139:28.54]On it.
[139:29.22]So...
[139:31.48]These two birds.
[139:32.86]That's actually perfect.
[139:35.46]I knocked yours over.
[139:36.16]I'm sorry.
[139:36.48]We're going to make sure they are perfectly aligned.
[139:50.95]Beak.
[139:51.75]Somebody said beak to beak.
[139:52.83]Wait, I shouldn't have said that.
[139:57.80]Oh, they can't hear us right now.
[140:01.62]if we're too close it's too it's obvious so if I'm in here and I do the um genuinely that like possess you do you pretend to be another person on their team do I have to be out of the object to do it I think you'll automatically leave the object when you hit it
[140:33.32]Oh God, here they come.
[140:44.62]We could do something wacky.
[140:50.68]We could hold right click and aim at the same person and try to instantly kill them.
[140:56.97]OK.
[140:58.71]Right here, someone's gonna come investigate in a second.
[141:05.38]Didn't work.
[141:08.41]I'm sorry.
[141:22.57]It didn't work.
[141:35.46]That's okay.
[141:36.26]It was a solid plan.
[141:37.76]They moved right at the last second and we couldn't get it.
[141:39.72]They're still alive though, so that's good.
[141:43.74]Yeah.
[141:57.79]I'm just like walking around as this...
[142:05.47]Oh shit, we're blocking each other.
[142:23.08]Do it!
[142:35.25]Do it!
[142:36.27]Do it!
[142:51.70]Oh no, please!
[143:42.70]Oh my god, I forgot that you guys hear that.
[143:44.14]Holy shit, I'm so sorry.
[143:45.99]I forgot that you're hearing that on the stream.
[143:48.53]I'm like just fucking with him like, oh, he's definitely not the pig.
[143:50.91]They won't ever know.
[143:52.47]I'm trying to do pig noises over there so they think like, oh, he's pretending to be the pig.
[143:56.66]You know what I mean?
[144:01.06]Yeah.
[144:01.20]You guys will hear it.
[144:01.78]I don't want to fuck with you guys.
[144:23.91]Looks like Bugleberry.
[144:41.62]Do we still have up?
[144:45.90]Just one?
[144:46.52]Two?
[144:47.86]Two, yeah.
[144:50.24]Take it all four.
[144:50.84]Alright, this is going to be tough.
[144:54.56]I stayed in one spot the entire game.
[144:56.50]Did you really?
[144:58.50]It was a cup of a brontosaurus dead.
[145:06.55]By the way, the shunt ability after you're dead is really powerful and I'm playing fucking soccer with the sun right now.
[145:15.64]Us pigs love to roll around in mud.
[145:20.16]Pigs love rolling around in mud Back here
[145:51.94]Alright.
[145:52.30]We got it.
[145:52.58]We got it.
[145:52.80]We got it.
[145:53.08]Get him.
[145:59.51]Squeak.
[146:00.47]I'm not going to squeak.
[146:01.81]People hate that shit.
[146:03.43]It's very cramped in here.
[146:05.07]There's one thing that people hate.
[146:06.53]It's fucking pig squealing noises.
[146:09.57]Nobody likes it.
[146:10.13]They hate it.
[146:11.03]It's like, dude, don't.
[146:11.86]Like, I hate that sound.
[146:15.04]That's a good game.
[146:18.40]Alone in the dark illumination, Jerma?
[146:22.13]Um, I've had this same profile picture for, like, at least five years or so.
[146:27.35]Okay, fair enough.
[146:28.41]Mine's probably since 2007, so I gotcha.
[146:31.35]I kind of have this burn in my brain of hiding in Team Fortress.
[146:35.44]Oh, they can't hear me anymore.
[146:38.24]Uh, you'd change your profile picture and my name would be, like, fucking, like, Inspector Gadget.
[146:42.98]So people wouldn't know it was me.
[146:46.40]I could explain that.
[146:52.35]I was going to ask you, Gemma, why Gas Can?
[146:55.71]Okay, I can give a really good explanation.
[146:58.07]So, back in the day, I used to make Team Fortress 2 videos, right?
[147:03.06]And if I was Jerma, like Jerma985 in a Team Fortress 2 game with a Jerma profile picture or something...
[147:12.32]people would see it and people would stand at the spawn and like high five and the whole game sometimes would get all messed up.
[147:18.89]So what I started doing is just starting making my name something completely different every single day and changing my avatar to something different every single day.
[147:28.04]So I could just, nobody would even know it was me.
[147:31.74]Gemma, I'm going to be real.
[147:32.56]I was in the menu, like the ready menu for 90% of that conversation.
[147:37.21]So I joined in for like the last two seconds of it.
[147:42.13]Alright, TL;DR.
[147:42.91]What?
[147:43.69]TL;DR.
[147:45.31]Back in Team Fortress 2, I used to hide so people wouldn't know it was me playing, so like I could be, I could get like a real gameplay that wasn't like five pocket medics and like five people outside the spawn trying to high-five me.
[147:57.18]There you go, right?
[147:57.72]Pirate spy.
[147:59.02]Yeah.
[148:01.86]Yeah, I used to watch you, Gemma.
[148:03.64]I still watch you.
[148:04.90]Oh, cool.
[148:06.32]That's cool.
[148:07.46]I'm watching you right now.
[148:08.20]You trying to act like a normal person?
[148:10.53]Fucking hilarious.
[148:13.26]Hey, I wake up in the morning like everybody else.
[148:17.99]I brush my teeth once a week.
[148:20.83]I wear pants sometimes, maybe once a week.
[148:24.57]I'm a normal person just like you.
[148:25.77]Okay, at what point do you clean up the blood of your last night's victim?
[148:28.96]Alright, now I know you watch.
[148:34.88]Now I know you watch the channel.
[148:36.14]Now I know you watch it.
[148:49.09]We got a jolly imposter over here, by the way.
[148:52.85]Hey, come here.
[148:53.97]What do you want to go?
[148:54.65]You said the word.
[148:56.13]Do you want to go upstairs?
[148:56.90]What do you think this should be?
[148:59.12]Wait, that's the real person.
[148:59.96]What?
[149:00.66]Hey, what's the emote button?
[149:03.30]Pose to fake people.
[149:04.44]Wait, how is that the real?
[149:05.60]There was two jollies on the screen.
[149:06.74]Did I follow the wrong one?
[149:09.22]It's V.
[149:16.01]Wait, why are there two me?
[149:17.45]Okay, somebody's fucking pretending to be me.
[149:19.55]I followed the wrong one.
[149:20.37]I thought you were the fake one.
[149:22.07]Jeez, that's not me.
[149:28.78]Over here.
[149:33.38]My dick, we're all...
[149:47.60]That's weird.
[149:53.15]No activity over here.
[150:02.89]Creepy.
[150:03.15]I'm not getting any activity at all.
[150:11.92]Here we go.
[150:12.32]Somebody over here.
[150:16.10]Oh, they're moving.
[150:16.63]They're on the move.
[150:29.82]There's somebody here.
[150:35.38]He was the duck.
[150:36.71]Of course he's the fucking duck.
[150:37.97]He's the duck.
[150:40.69]That spy is not one of us.
[150:41.89]That heavy is a spy.
[150:43.01]That sniper is a heavy.
[150:44.43]That heavy is not one of us.
[150:45.63]That one of us is you.
[150:46.65]I made that joke like 10 years ago.
[150:49.15]God, was it good.
[150:59.66]Listen, you didn't know I was the duck.
[151:02.42]You had no idea.
[151:03.59]At this point, you do the duck so often that, like, you aren't the duck now.
[151:10.49]You know what I mean?
[151:13.65]I see the strats.
[151:14.51]Yeah.
[151:14.77]Aww.
[151:27.21]Did you find anything?
[151:27.81]I am not getting anything.
[151:32.67]Just keep shooting.
[151:35.48]There's a little bit in this room, but it keeps going up and down.
[151:39.48]It will go down if they're taunting or jumping or moving in any way.
[151:45.56]Really?
[151:45.88]Okay.
[151:47.04]So they can just move backwards and forwards.
[151:48.38]There's an ectoplasm meter on your right hand side when you're a ghost.
[151:53.37]And when that fills up, you become more aware.
[151:58.00]Yeah, they can see you easier.
[151:59.76]So as long as you keep that low, he's totally one of these ducks.
[152:03.20]Are they all ducks?
[152:04.52]I can see that as a strat.
[152:07.95]I want it to be all spacemen.
[152:09.19]The spacemen are fucking creepy.
[152:12.29]It's actually probably a good idea.
[152:13.07]In really stupid spots.
[152:14.77]Just all be the same item.
[152:15.97]Just be in the same room and spread out.
[152:18.00]Why would they ever do that?
[152:21.09]Also, there's a little orc with headphones on that nobody's ever been, and I feel like that's a missed opportunity.
[152:27.12]In here.
[152:27.38]In here.
[152:28.00]Trashcan.
[152:28.62]In here on me.
[152:31.84]Trashcan.
[152:33.60]Plant.
[152:36.41]On it.
[152:36.71]He's cranking.
[152:40.65]He's low.
[152:43.97]Got him.
[152:44.97]Yep.
[152:45.71]Oh, there's another one here.
[152:46.49]There's another one.
[152:47.32]The triceratops.
[152:58.19]He's over here as a zebra?
[153:00.94]Oh, nope.
[153:02.66]Somebody just booted up that Game Boy.
[153:08.61]Oh, it's the smile ghost.
[153:10.09]Another one.
[153:17.22]Remember, kite them.
[153:18.72]Don't stand still.
[153:20.36]I couldn't even... I got stuck on the stairs.
[153:22.08]My body was stuck on the stairs.
[153:23.64]I immediately died.
[153:25.10]Well, yeah, okay, good, cool.
[153:27.22]I swear to God, I got stuck on the staircase.
[153:29.14]I couldn't move, I couldn't walk forward.
[153:30.28]No pressure, no pressure.
[153:31.48]Like, I was stuck on the stairs.

[154:17.48]Like I'm gonna make a big announcement like Boston.
[154:19.72]I'm coming back.
[154:20.78]I'm here what like I'm but I'm jolly annoying Oh God everyone's after you You've changed.
[154:27.77]I am the last one left Would make sense You're near the supply center if you can kill yourself.
[154:36.22]That's us.
[154:36.58]That's bullshit That's not a chance, but oh, there's they're on you.
[154:41.64]Oh god.
[154:42.00]Oh
[154:45.78]That is so scary.
[154:47.30]Oh!
[154:48.06]Good try.
[154:48.44]That was scary.
[154:52.28]Nice, nice, nice.
[154:54.18]That was spooky.
[154:56.10]I love the bear.
[154:58.63]Bear and astronaut.
[155:01.97]Alright.
[155:03.57]I'm going to head back into Discord and unmute and just thank everybody.
[155:07.49]Cool.
[155:07.81]Sounds good, man.
[155:09.17]Sounds good.
[155:14.99]I've unmuted.
[155:18.48]know what that was pretty good for a bootleg prop hunt to make sure yeah it was fun no that was a lot of fun yeah uh I think it could use a little bit of work in some spots and the balancing is weird but and also the positional voice chat's like a little too low but yeah it was great I enjoyed it yeah I think that some of the weapons maybe need some uh tuning
[155:44.60]But I think it was overall a solid experience.
[155:47.64]That was a lot of fun.
[155:49.28]Jerma, I use an assault shotgun in real life to defend against mosquitoes.
[155:55.69]And they're expecting me to use that against ghosts?
[155:58.93]I mean, it worked.
[156:01.15]It worked pretty well.
[156:02.27]I added the extended mag to my shotgun, so it had two barrels with three shots, and that was just amusing the whole time.
[156:08.13]It also killed ghosts pretty well, too, if you were up close.
[156:10.11]It certainly did.
[156:10.57]It's probably my favorite gun.
[156:11.65]No, that was fun.
[156:13.94]Cool.
[156:14.28]Well, I appreciate everybody joining.
[156:15.94]Hey, let's do this again.
[156:18.34]Let's do this again sometime.
[156:20.08]Absolutely.
[156:22.62]Let's get a crew for another game.
[156:23.66]Whatever, man.
[156:24.34]I'm down for anything.
[156:25.94]I'm down for another game with the crew.
[156:28.43]And also, if you'd ever want to play Phasmophobia again, Jerma, anyone really here, I'd be totally down and I no longer weep.
[156:37.48]Was there a new update or something?
[156:39.49]Huge updates.
[156:40.03]Yeah, many since.
[156:41.19]There's a VR update that has overhauled the VR mechanics of the game.
[156:45.67]Ooh, okay.
[156:46.33]I'm listening.
[156:47.23]I like the VR version, but yeah.
[156:50.43]So it seems pretty kind of necessary, but it seems cool.
[156:55.17]So, yeah, that was great.

[158:38.73]Okay, let me put this up here.
[158:47.68]You see?
[158:48.00]I can't hear it.
[158:48.70]I can't hear it.
[158:49.90]I can't hear it.
[159:17.59]Why can I not hear this?
[159:18.57]I can't hear this.
[159:19.01]You guys can hear it?
[159:43.22]This reminds me of that time I went to your school dance, Moe.
[159:49.82]I haven't been part of a team since I was with the Four Peters.
[159:53.62]This reminds me of that time I went to your school dance, Moe.
[159:58.10]Okay, I can hear it.
[160:02.80]I don't know why I couldn't hear it before.
[160:05.87]I'm sorry.
[160:08.63]My OBS is fucking crashed right now, by the way.
[160:10.95]I can't close it.
[160:16.91]Something is wrong.
[160:20.09]It happened eight times.
[160:20.99]I don't know what's going on.
[160:22.63]I cannot even close OBS.
[160:23.93]I cannot close OBS.
[160:28.29]OBS is frozen.
[160:32.68]That was very weird.
[160:33.48]I'm sorry.
[160:35.42]Anyways.
[160:37.38]Yeah, I couldn't hear it at first.
[160:38.36]Don't ask me why.
[160:38.98]I have no idea.
[160:39.56]I don't understand computers.
[160:41.68]Alright, so.
[160:43.30]Here's the deal.
[160:44.62]Is it still playing?
[160:48.12]No, it's not, right?
[160:49.94]Okay.
[160:52.93]So here's the deal.
[160:55.03]It is?
[160:55.33]Alright, so here's what we're doing.
[160:58.77]So tomorrow, I'm jumbling up the schedule a little bit.
[161:01.27]That was really fun to see all those guys again.
[161:04.61]Let's do it again soon.
[161:06.75]First of all, that's going to be it for today.
[161:10.10]I wanted to do DOS tomorrow, but I want a little bit more time to curate some more.
[161:14.06]Because I have like 30 DOS games in Windows 3.1 games.
[161:21.51]I think I got to maybe get a couple more and shave some down because there's just so many.
[161:25.95]So we'll do that this weekend.
[161:27.01]But tomorrow...
[161:29.02]tomorrow we're going to play wrestling empire an update came out that's apparently a ton of content and I really want to play it so wrestling empire tomorrow we're going to start not at six we're going to start about four o'clock pacific tomorrow and we'll get back into wrestling empire there's a gm mode now where you can just walk around town as the general manager of a league we're doing that right
[161:57.01]But yeah, I'll be live tomorrow.
[161:58.45]And then we'll be live on Friday or Saturday as well.
[162:02.27]And maybe we'll do Wrestling Empire again.
[162:04.51]We'll see.
[162:07.16]Just a quick stream.
[162:07.92]I wanted to just go live.
[162:09.34]Because Vinny was like, hey, do you want to play this?
[162:13.50]And I'm like, yeah, sure.
[162:14.04]It sounds fun.
[162:15.12]So just a quick one today.
[162:16.60]I'll see you tomorrow.
[162:18.91]As always, thanks for watching.
[162:21.87]We'll see you less than 24 hours from now.

[162:31.69]Pacific tomorrow.
[162:33.19]Good.
[162:33.57]I had a lot of fun.
[162:34.31]Hope you did, too.
[162:35.83]The game was fun.
[162:37.34]It's my first experience, really, with Prop Hunt.
[162:43.32]I have to eat a shoe now?
[162:44.38]I did.
[162:45.38]I played Shido in the beginning.
[162:48.00]There's no batteries, but that's what Shido would have sounded like.
[162:58.33]I pressed the buttons to play.
[162:59.54]It was just very soft because the Shido is out of batteries.
[163:02.56]But it's still very soft.
[163:03.70]You just couldn't hear it.
[163:16.67]Daily Shido.
[163:19.01]Ha ha.
[163:22.27]Okay, so who's still alive from that group?
[163:24.97]Is, like, Vinny or Criken or Ross or anybody still alive from that group of people?
[163:33.47]Or was everybody kind of taken off?
[163:41.30]They're all still alive.
[163:42.12]Let's go, um... It's been a while.
[163:44.04]Let's write Criken.
[163:44.58]It's been a while.
[163:46.16]It's been a while since we have said hello to Criken, which is cool to play with him.
[164:00.48]Okay, here we go.
[164:02.24]I will see you guys later.
[164:07.60]He's playing some kind of stream game.
[164:09.56]Oh, really?
[164:09.96]That'd be interesting.
[164:10.80]Hopefully, I don't, like, ruin it.
[164:16.52]Is he doing, like, a stream chat game?
[164:18.84]Oh, God.
[164:20.52]Be nice.
[164:21.98]Work well with others, or I'm gonna be pissed.
[164:23.96]Alright, goodnight, guys.

[164:32.00]Take care of yourselves.
