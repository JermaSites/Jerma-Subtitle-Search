[00:01.25]Oh god, oh god, oh, this sniper does.
[00:05.07]I hate good sni- I mean, uh, I mean helicopter.
[00:10.59]I hate good helicopters.
[00:12.29]Yeah, they're the worst.
[00:15.31]I'm an asshole at the game.
[00:17.65]He says as he RPGs the fucker in the face.
[00:20.25]Yeah!
[00:21.23]Did you get him?
[00:22.17]Yeah!
[00:23.45]Awesome!
[00:24.17]I mean, it was like the easiest shot ever, though.
[00:26.67]Fucking legend.
[00:27.47]It would have been embarrassing if I'd have missed him.
[00:30.45]Alright, then.
[00:31.25]You shouldn't have said that, man.
[00:32.87]Why'd you tell me that?
[00:34.03]Because I, like, overreact to every helicopter I shoot.
[00:41.89]Why are you swimming in the pool?
[00:43.17]We gotta fight.
[00:44.01]I didn't want to.
[00:44.67]I didn't think it was that deep that it would make me swim.
[00:46.67]Oh!
[00:47.19]Oh, he's gonna get it!
[00:48.09]He's gonna get it!
[00:49.19]Oh, yeah!
[00:49.63]Oh, my God!
[00:55.10]Overreaction, baby.
[00:58.18]I'm taking that car and heading up there.
[01:00.06]Actually, Dave, I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:03.60]Go on!
[01:04.48]Oh, yes!
[01:04.96]What a shot!
[01:05.72]Fuck!
[01:06.20]You got him?
[01:06.72]Nice.
[01:07.60]Maybe that's the one I should have overreacted to.
[01:11.10]Yeah, probably, actually.
[01:14.21]Since there are four of us now, two of us could both do the same thing in jeeps.
[01:19.89]You are heavily mistaken, because I am like a toddler at this game.
[01:26.65]We're driving around in jeeps being retards.
[01:29.35]We're not even doing anything.
[01:30.61]Sorry, Theo, I have to jump out to talk to Blowtorch's car, I'm sorry.
[01:34.70]Alright, it's okay.
[01:38.78]Oh, a car!
[01:39.22]A car!
[01:40.30]Kill it!
[01:41.18]Oh, he jumped out, never mind.
[01:42.18]He jumped out.
[01:45.41]Cut to Blowtorch Edge.
[01:46.85]Not sure what I'm doing here.
[01:49.41]Oh!
[01:50.27]It's a Jerma Booster Killer and Manteo Booster Killer.
[01:54.19]Spawning on you, boo.
[01:55.61]Ah, yeah.
[01:56.00]Jerma, come out and look at this.
[01:57.10]You'll like this.
[01:57.56]What?
[02:04.12]It's a blowtorch.
[02:05.64]Did you just burn that guy's face up?
[02:08.00]I just burned, like, three of them.
[02:09.82]Oh my god!
[02:12.70]And now you can do it.
[02:16.20]Proceeds to just... Blowtorch.
[02:19.66]Yes!
[02:19.92]Oh, there's another one.
[02:21.09]Yeah... aww.
[02:26.35]What happened?
[02:27.67]You got the best laugh ever.
[02:31.77]I thought it hurt so much.
[02:39.91]What happened?
[02:41.67]I blow torched one stupid sniper, and then he told his stupid sniper friend to turn around, and he was like, oh god, and then he pulled out a gun, and I went to pull out my gun, and I pulled out my RPG, and it just blasted him in the face.
[02:58.93]Silly snipers.
[03:07.21]Oh my...
[03:09.50]I nearly hit the jet by accident, I was trying to lead the chopper, I twitched my aim off to my right and I nearly hit an oncoming jet.
[03:15.79]Jesus.
[03:18.35]Come on.
[03:20.01]Yeah, there we go, got your hat time.
[03:23.73]No need to orgasm about it, it wasn't that far away.
[03:26.24]Actually, yeah, it was, never mind.
[03:29.32]Hey, I decide when I orgasm, okay?
[03:34.56]Made you, let's go.
[03:35.74]Where are we going?
[03:37.37]Oh god!
[03:39.49]Jesus Christ, did you get driven over?
[03:42.24]I fucking jumped down and there was like an instant, like, Jeep coming out around the corner.
[03:47.54]Oh shit.
[03:57.43]Go on, one more.
[03:58.09]Last one before the game ends.
[04:01.30]Go on.
[04:02.79]Oh, you beautiful... It was in the last second.
[04:05.63]Did you get it?
[04:06.33]Yeah.
[04:07.77]Right at the death.
[04:08.89]I saw that.
[04:10.79]It was a nice explosion as well.
[04:13.40]Hmm.
[04:15.28]Love me a good chopper explosion.
[04:16.74]That was a beast.
