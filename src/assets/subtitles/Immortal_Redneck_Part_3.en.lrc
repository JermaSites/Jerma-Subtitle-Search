[01:21.91]Hi, everybody.
[01:24.23]Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27.12]We are Tonight's Entertainment.
[01:28.56]I've done that before.
[01:29.28]Remember when I did that before?
[01:31.38]Ladies and gentlemen, the Joker.
[01:33.08]Remember when I did the Joker impression?
[01:38.29]Hi, guys.
[01:38.61]I hope everybody's doing well.
[01:41.69]I hope you guys are having a fantastic Saturday.
[01:49.01]There's your spoiler alert.
[01:50.31]It ain't Saturday.
[01:51.89]Just keeping you up, making sure you guys are on your toes.
[01:53.94]You gotta make sure you guys are aware that it's not Saturday.
[01:56.58]It's, in fact, Tuesday.
[01:58.60]Count up again.
[01:59.58]Twice in a row.
[02:01.38]Welcome to Thursday.
[02:01.96]Welcome to Thirsty Thursday, where, you know, we take a shot every time we do something fucked up.
[02:10.20]Hi, guys.
[02:12.40]Welcome to the stream.
[02:17.71]Websites still have crummy click... Yeah, well... Yeah.
[02:25.07]We're gonna play Immortal Redneck again.
[02:27.97]We're gonna cap it tonight.
[02:29.78]This is gonna be the final time we play Immortal Redneck.
[02:34.18]But I'm having fun with the game.
[02:35.04]I think it's a very fun game.
[02:36.78]I'm enjoying it very much so.
[02:40.48]So if you want to get my stamp of approval for a video game that's only $20, it would be this one.
[02:47.53]Immortal Redneck is on Steam.
[02:51.84]I would give it a check if you like first-person shooters with upgrades and spending money in roguelike elements.
[02:58.12]It's very fun.
[02:59.94]So with that, let's switch over to the game.
[03:05.19]Move over here.
[03:06.59]You know, why not?
[03:09.25]Why the heck not, you know?
[03:11.49]Why the heck not?
[03:14.10]So, uh, we're not going to do Twitch integration for the first little while.
[03:19.57]And it's because I want to be able to read chat.
[03:23.61]And I can't read chat because it's a 1-2-3 stream.
[03:28.95]So, no Twitch integration for the first, I'd say, give me like an hour.
[03:32.89]Let me like play the game for like an hour.
[03:35.95]And then I'll turn it on for the last like hour or two.
[03:39.32]You know, we'll just go halfway with no Twitch integration.
[03:43.48]We get to play Fuck the Streamer in like... Two hours.
[03:48.75]Maybe an hour and a half.
[03:54.05]Just say 1, 2, 3 anyways.
[03:55.13]Don't do that.
[03:56.39]Because there's going to be no reason to.
[04:01.83]So, do I have any money?
[04:03.49]That's the last thing we did.
[04:05.47]I don't have enough.
[04:06.05]I'm just going to have to do a run as Seth...
[04:11.73]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[04:13.47]Fuck the streamer.
[04:15.07]No, no, you understand what I was trying to say.
[04:17.59]You know what I meant by that.
[04:22.06]Let me have fun for an hour.
[04:24.56]That's not what I mean, but you understand.
[04:27.70]It's like Rogue Legacy.
[04:28.60]Yes.
[04:29.64]This is a FPS Rogue Legacy without, like, all the goofy shit.
[04:33.02]I mean, there's some goofy shit in the game, but... The goofy shit is not the... You know, not the important part.
[04:42.53]There is goofy shit in this game though.
[04:43.86]Let's try to get a decent run in.
[04:52.50]For our first ever run in the game.
[04:54.06]Because I've never played this game before.
[05:00.73]This is my first time ever playing.
[05:02.83]So I want to impress you guys with a decent run.
[05:11.86]Why are we in sub only?
[05:12.74]We're in sub only right now?
[05:14.80]What happened?
[05:17.52]Oh, I think maybe because of the 1, 2, 3 joke.
[05:21.55]Alright, well, we'll wait for that to die down and we'll take off sub only.
[05:29.91]Ooh, a scroll!
[05:30.91]See, you guys didn't even vote for this.
[05:32.07]That means it's not going to be a bad one.
[05:34.56]It's going to be a decent one.
[05:38.97]Let's see what this one is.
[05:39.65]Alright, here we go.
[05:40.73]twitch.tv integration.
[05:46.56]Alright, so it didn't even matter.
[05:51.70]I turned off the fucking Twitch integration.
[05:54.62]And I still got fucked.
[05:59.06]Okay.
[05:59.72]Well, off to a great start, it seems.
[06:05.27]Here we go.
[06:06.31]Round two.
[06:09.19]Reward... That's terrible.
[06:10.51]Rewards take longer to disappear.
[06:12.09]Who cares?
[06:14.23]And it's a crowbar.
[06:15.11]The crowbar... You know what?
[06:15.91]I actually would rather have the crowbar than this.
[06:17.77]That thing is so bad.
[06:19.18]Is that it?
[06:21.90]Is there any more?
[06:24.60]Is this a ukulele?
[06:25.78]No, this is not in fact a ukulele.
[06:28.72]This is a mortal redneck.
[06:32.34]Okay.
[06:33.00]Whatever.
[06:35.76]Time trial!
[06:37.42]Oh dear.
[06:37.82]Time trial.
[06:38.35]Okay.
[06:43.41]Watch this fucking time trial.
[06:45.85]You don't think I ever played fucking Super Mario Brothers 4?
[06:49.33]One, two, three, go!
[06:51.98]Another scroll.
[06:55.40]Don't be useless.
[06:57.22]Jackpot.
[06:58.68]Beautiful.
[07:01.58]Is this our Western Week?
[07:02.96]Alright, so let me explain what the hell happened to Western Week.
[07:06.46]For all you guys asking about it.
[07:08.67]So I had this thing where I was doing themes for like two weeks at a time.
[07:12.62]One we did Game Show Week.
[07:14.26]We did Dinosaur Week.
[07:16.68]And Western Week was supposed to be that I had like seven Western games to play.
[07:20.86]And they were all different, they were all crazy, some of them were like first-person shooters from like a decade ago.
[07:25.72]They were very cool.
[07:27.00]They were interesting.
[07:27.62]It wasn't just like I was gonna play Fistful of Frags for fucking four days, you know what I mean?
[07:31.22]That's not what it was.
[07:33.02]Every single Western game that I bought from Amazon did not work.
[07:40.19]They did not work.
[07:41.07]They did not fucking function.
[07:43.11]I tried to run these things in virtual machines,
[07:49.59]No.
[07:50.63]I did a Windows 95 virtual machine.
[07:53.21]Didn't work.
[07:53.85]Windows 98 virtual machine.
[07:55.95]Didn't work.
[07:57.43]Every single one.
[07:59.67]More Mario references.
[08:01.51]I didn't make any Mario.
[08:02.85]I didn't make a Mario reference.
[08:04.09]I made a Mario game reference.
[08:06.59]That's not the same.
[08:09.19]I referenced a Mario video game.
[08:11.36]I didn't reference Mario.
[08:13.86]Ow.
[08:20.51]It's not the same.
[08:25.11]Try turning it off and turning it on.
[08:27.17]You want to talk about, like, the most stressed week?
[08:29.23]Like, the most, like, stressed, like, five days for streaming for me over the last, like, three months?
[08:35.75]It was trying to get, like, some of these old fucking, like, cereal box shit games to work and be reliable.
[08:43.60]Half the times, like, they didn't even work.
[08:46.66]And I had to do so many things to make them work.
[08:49.24]It was so hair-pull-out insane.
[08:55.06]But, I do still have those games.
[08:57.66]And, like, they look so much fun.
[09:01.16]I lost all my Koopa subs.
[09:02.94]Did you do a Windows 98 installation?
[09:04.58]Yes, I did.
[09:06.06]Second edition.
[09:06.58]Windows 98 second edition.
[09:07.68]It worked perfectly fine.
[09:09.72]It was great.
[09:10.66]It was running in a virtual machine.
[09:12.36]It was great.
[09:16.72]It just still wouldn't work.
[09:19.48]I don't know why.
[09:20.30]Don't ask me.
[09:20.84]I have no idea.
[09:21.68]And at this point, I'm so annoyed by it that I don't even want to talk about it anymore.
[09:26.84]You know?
[09:27.86]In fact, if somebody brings up Western Week, permanently ban them.
[09:34.26]Fuck.
[09:39.02]I like the kunai.
[09:42.61]Kunai is one of the best weapons, though.
[09:48.99]Uh, hey, thank you, Dedo.
[09:51.43]Dedo, Dedo, Dedo.
[09:53.39]For the $15, they say, there's a spiderweb in a cup that's been in my room for a month.
[09:57.97]Anyway, here's money.
[09:58.73]Go buy some Wendy's kids' meal games.
[10:03.55]Uh, thanks.
[10:04.97]Thank you for the $15, Dedo.
[10:05.93]Appreciate it.
[10:08.83]Always very kind.
[10:10.15]Very kind of you.
[10:13.51]Let's discuss.
[10:14.57]All of you banned.
[10:15.65]Just wait.
[10:16.55]Yeah, I want you to keep a list.
[10:18.24]Keep a list of all these people.
[10:19.96]I want you to keep a list.
[10:22.76]And then go through and permaban them all.
[10:28.02]And I want to ban everybody that doesn't agree with me.
[10:34.18]No, we're not going to get political here.
[10:38.36]You don't agree with me politically?
[10:39.78]Ban them forever.
[10:49.55]You want to talk about how, like, Pop-Tarts are better than Toaster Strudels?
[10:52.88]Ban them.
[10:54.96]Because how the fuck could you ever think that?
[10:57.68]You know, there was, like, a debate years ago.
[10:59.96]Hey, what's better?
[11:01.06]Pop-Tarts or Toaster Strudels?
[11:02.64]It's like, motherfucker, Toaster Strudels are a thousand times better.
[11:07.94]How dare you even mention that Pop-Tarts could be even worth being in the same sentence as Toaster Strudels?
[11:16.53]Like, how dare you even say that?
[11:20.55]Nobody thinks that, do they?
[11:22.67]I don't know.
[11:22.95]People do, man.
[11:24.54]Look, Pop-Tarts are good.
[11:25.70]I think Pop-Tarts are a good snack.
[11:28.82]But, I mean, they're not Toaster Strudels.
[11:31.30]But the icing, the Toaster Strudels icing.
[11:33.24]Oh, I'm motivated.
[11:44.57]Ah, shit.
[11:45.39]No, what?
[11:46.43]I can't shoot through that?
[11:48.29]I can't go underneath that?
[11:49.57]Come on, developers.
[11:51.25]What's with that video game problem that I see?
[11:53.76]Mmm, one more thing.
[12:05.86]I'm crazy.
[12:07.49]No, if you're new to the stream, if you've only been here for like a little while, there's something you need to know.
[12:14.41]I'm fucking crazy.
[12:19.41]And not like in, not in like the, oh man, I'm so crazy.
[12:23.27]Like, look at me.
[12:23.91]I do such crazy things.
[12:25.09]No, like I'm fucking insane.
[12:26.33]I'm fucked.
[12:28.94]I had a doctor's appointment like three days ago and the doctor just came in and I like, I just started talking nonsense to him.
[12:35.48]And he just, he yawned.
[12:36.38]He yawned during our little fucking talk.
[12:40.65]And he was like, I'm just so tired of you.
[12:43.61]And he fucking walked out.
[12:47.90]And he wrote me like seven prescriptions.
[12:50.92]I was like, what the fuck?
[12:51.72]Seven prescriptions?
[12:53.40]Flonase?
[12:53.90]I don't need Flonase.
[12:57.08]He just wrote a bunch of random drugs down and left the room.
[13:00.57]It was weird.
[13:10.13]Were you the doctor?
[13:11.07]No.
[13:17.67]Prescription.
[13:19.77]Jeremiah prescribed mayonnaise.
[13:23.13]No, I didn't get prescribed mayonnaise.
[13:28.46]Also something you need to mention if you're new to the stream.
[13:33.16]45% of everything I say is not true.
[13:34.68]I mean, that's very important for you guys to know, right?
[13:40.32]So, like, I'm fucking, I'm legally crazy.
[13:44.62]And 45% of everything I've ever said is not true.
[13:48.60]So, good luck.
[13:49.38]Welcome to Jerma985, good luck.
[13:52.38]That should be my tagline.
[13:54.92]Hey, welcome to Jerma985, good fucking luck.
[14:01.91]That should be on, like, a t-shirt, you know what I mean?
[14:03.77]Wow, that would sell.
[14:05.75]Alright, I am being a little weird right now, I'm sorry.
[14:12.66]Wait, you're not seven feet tall?
[14:14.12]No, I'm not.
[14:17.58]He doesn't even do his taxes.
[14:18.60]I don't do my taxes.
[14:19.52]You're right.
[14:20.70]Somebody else has them for me.
[14:26.53]45% also is not true.
[14:27.55]It's about 85%.
[14:30.69]See?
[14:31.29]That guy gets it.
[14:32.95]That guy gets it.
[14:34.63]Welcome to GermanN85.
[14:35.53]Fucking hands and arms inside the vehicle at all times.
[14:38.89]Put that on his shirt.
[14:39.99]That's my new tagline.
[14:42.60]It's gonna say, welcome to Jerma985.
[14:44.14]Ha!
[14:45.18]Like, H-A-H.
[14:47.30]And then, keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times.
[14:49.86]And then, like, comma, bitch.
[14:53.79]And then, like, period.
[14:55.91]And then after that, it's gonna say, right on!
[15:01.13]Think that'll sell?
[15:07.75]Think that'll give me a book deal?
[15:11.80]Doesn't even wear pants on stream.
[15:18.95]No, I don't wear pants on stream, you're right.
[15:23.83]Uh, over here.
[15:27.59]I would buy a hundred, put that on stream.
[15:33.66]Like, then comma, like, random thing.
[15:41.59]That.
[15:42.03]Like what I just said.
[15:43.59]Comma, then like some random thing.
[15:47.95]And then in quotes.
[15:52.60]You don't miss the 100% of the shots you don't take.
[15:55.80]Wayne Gretzky.
[16:01.08]Gotta have like a Wayne Gretzky, Gretzky, Wayne Gretzky quote on there.
[16:13.21]Comma.
[16:14.43]Comma, it's over.
[16:15.69]No.
[16:18.43]I had a really good day today.
[16:22.16]Can I just tell you guys that?
[16:22.94]It was a good day.
[16:25.92]I went to the beach today.
[16:27.98]That was great.
[16:28.62]It was like 96 degrees around here.
[16:32.02]That was... It was great.
[16:34.86]It was very, very nice.
[16:37.10]I'm gonna sneeze, and I really don't mean to be rude, but I'm gonna sneeze.
[16:42.52]Sorry about that Okay, I've been in so many rooms and I still have not found the room to go up This is gonna be a long one pull your pants up because it's gonna be a long one It's not over here either I don't want to be up there
[17:08.54]This guy even lies about sneezing.
[17:11.53]See?
[17:12.71]Wow!
[17:14.89]Did you see how fake that wow was, by the way?
[17:18.03]Wow!
[17:19.68]I gotta put it on for the stream, right?
[17:21.22]If I'm a streamer.
[17:24.08]Whoa!
[17:36.64]Okay.
[17:37.56]Where have I not gone?
[17:39.50]Down the left, I guess, over here, and lower left up here, too.
[17:47.44]How do I get up there?
[17:52.21]Yoink.
[17:56.99]I love how you guys only take one of these to die.
[17:59.01]That makes me happy.
[18:00.91]I'm not even using my right click, either.
[18:04.93]Don't ask me why.
[18:11.51]I seem a little more insane than usual.
[18:14.63]Do I?
[18:19.94]Maybe I do.
[18:21.22]I have to concentrate here, though, because there's a lot of random enemies.
[18:28.40]Watch out for the snakes.
[18:33.04]Finally found the room.
[18:39.32]These scrolls are so bad, too.
[18:41.34]Can I please get new scrolls?
[18:43.60]Where's the thing you guys can vote for to reset?
[18:45.84]There is no voting.
[18:48.26]I'm just realizing this.
[18:56.81]More talkative and random than usual at saying something.
[18:59.15]I don't know.
[18:59.93]Sometimes you just have to be a little weird.
[19:05.63]God, I just, like, swear to God I saw a spider over here.
[19:09.11]That's an insta-puke for me.
[19:12.87]Maybe I should turn it on?
[19:13.81]No, I need to be able to not have a 1-2-3 chat.
[19:17.36]I like reading what you guys have to say.
[19:20.20]And that's a 1-2-3 chat.
[19:22.44]You guys want a 1-2-3 chat?
[19:24.22]Don't write it.
[19:25.04]Just tell me yes or no.
[19:26.00]Don't write 1-2-3.
[19:27.80]Just tell me yes or no.
[19:37.69]Shit.
[19:42.38]Come on, show your face.
[19:48.49]Subs who write dumb numbers burn on the stake.
[19:52.03]Holy shit, Luke.
[19:59.01]Did you turn on sub only mode for that?
[20:00.73]Oh, come on.
[20:03.20]It's okay.
[20:10.95]I like when they come at me from very far away.
[20:12.59]It makes it much easier for me.
[20:20.14]What?
[20:21.64]Well, that was... That was close.
[20:29.46]Really?
[20:30.16]That didn't even hit me.
[20:31.70]The game is a liar.
[20:32.80]And I can't reload this.
[20:33.86]I keep trying to reload.
[20:35.54]But I can't reload on command.
[20:42.49]Wait, what?
[20:50.58]I feel like I've played way too much on this character.
[20:59.75]Anybody else feel like that?
[21:00.55]I feel like I need more variety.
[21:07.25]Chest room, chest room, awesome, alright.
[21:11.39]How many chests are there?
[21:12.51]Two or three?
[21:14.09]Looks like there's two.
[21:16.28]There was dog shit in that one.
[21:17.84]Okay, come on.
[21:18.30]Give me a scroll.
[21:18.90]Give me a scroll that's not awful.
[21:21.16]There it is.
[21:21.88]Not awful.
[21:25.00]That's fine.
[21:26.42]That's good.
[21:31.03]Just blacklist one, two, three and then turn on Twitch interaction.
[21:37.37]I mean, in better twitch.tv, I could do that, but that requires me to be an intelligent, good streamer.
[21:44.64]And we all know that that is like... I'm way higher than that.
[21:50.73]Alright, I want to be honest here.
[21:52.81]You guys watching the stream, a lot of you guys have been around for a long time.
[21:55.89]What would you rate this stream out of three?
[21:59.70]What would you rate this stream out of three?
[22:01.60]One being like that, two being good, and three being great.
[22:04.73]What would you rate this stream out of three?
[22:06.75]I'm sorry.
[22:13.23]I'm sorry.
[22:13.77]All my mods are gonna fucking hate me right now.
[22:15.77]Uh...
[22:36.11]I'm sorry.
[22:37.01]I'm sorry.
[22:37.65]I had to do it.
[22:38.29]It's soft, too.
[22:52.48]I can live with that.
[22:55.89]I can live with that.
[23:02.19]Ban me from chat.
[23:03.41]You can't.
[23:05.57]I'm unbannable.
[23:06.61]Hey, guess what, guys?
[23:12.17]I own this ship.
[23:13.64]If the fucking ship burns down, the captain goes down with the ship.
[23:18.16]You know what I'm saying?
[23:18.94]That's me.
[23:21.30]And guess what?
[23:21.90]I would fix the problem.
[23:23.10]I would fucking fix the engine and turn it around and we would get back to safety.
[23:30.21]Captain goes down with his ship, though.
[23:32.78]I would give you guys all random little rafts or something if you wanted to go.
[23:39.46]How many people are on this boat?
[23:41.00]1500?
[23:42.54]It's a big boat.
[23:51.56]Isn't Amazon the captain?
[23:52.80]No, Amazon is the company that sold the boat.
[23:54.94]They have nothing to do with where the ship drives.
[24:00.52]Amazon has nothing to do with, like, where I... It's their boat, but I bought it.
[24:06.40]I purchased the boat.
[24:08.71]And sometimes I bring it back to get sanding done to it.
[24:11.59]You know, sometimes I bring it to get sanded.
[24:13.07]Other than that, though, you know, it's my boat.
[24:21.68]I wanted the money, and I got so greedy, I had to do it.
[24:24.58]It's alright, we're good.
[24:31.97]Subs and mods get the life rafts first.
[24:36.63]What the fuck?
[24:37.19]What is this, a Kaspersky?
[24:38.71]Get the fuck out of my screen.
[24:43.42]Kaspersky just like told me, he was just like, hey, there's a threat, be careful.
[24:46.82]Okay.
[24:54.74]Butchering a euphemism?
[24:56.04]What euphemism?
[24:59.40]Wait, now you guys talking about euphemizing me?
[25:01.40]You're gonna euph- you're gonna euph- euphemism?
[25:03.96]You're putting me down?
[25:07.28]No one's gonna fucking euphemize me, I'm sorry.
[25:09.48]This is my boat and I'm going down with the boat.
[25:11.16]I'm not gonna get euphemized.
[25:20.52]Fires.net.
[25:21.75]No, this is a new computer, guys.
[25:28.03]There's no virus on this computer.
[25:29.19]It is brand new.
[25:30.99]This is as new as a computer could be.
[25:37.06]Let's go straight down.
[25:42.42]Kind of running out of ammo.
[25:52.59]I want to get rid of these guys because they shoot the stupid bullet hell everywhere.
[26:00.74]Mm-hmm.
[26:02.74]Alright, now where?
[26:03.50]There's only one place I can go.
[26:09.16]Oh, there's two.
[26:09.72]Wrap around here.
[26:13.57]There's no question the boat is sinking.
[26:15.25]No, I think we have a pretty healthy boat.
[26:16.51]I think the boat is in pretty good shape right now.
[26:27.01]A couple dings and dents, but who doesn't have a couple of dings and dents on their boat?
[26:31.75]Most people I know with boats have, like, dings and dents.
[26:36.05]Really?
[26:36.29]God damn it.
[26:44.79]Um... Up and then right.
[26:52.68]Well, I just right-clicked.
[26:54.40]I'm a dumbass.
[26:56.97]You have no dings and dents on your boat, come on.
[26:59.07]That means you don't drive it.
[27:01.40]That means you don't drive your boat around.
[27:02.70]And that's fine.
[27:03.44]If you want to have a boat and you want to keep it in the garage, then you keep your boat in your garage.
[27:08.16]That's fine.
[27:09.70]That means you're not driving it around.
[27:10.90]But you gotta drive your boat.
[27:14.04]If you drive your boat, you're gonna have a couple of dings and dents and scratches.
[27:18.20]It's just gonna happen.
[27:19.00]Like, it's gonna be snowing out and you're gonna get, like, you know, the salt from the roads are gonna be on there.
[27:31.15]What the hell are you talking about?
[27:38.48]You know, here's my favorite part about this.
[27:41.00]Even my mods, even my most trusted mods, sometimes they just have no fucking idea what's going on.
[27:48.42]I love it.
[27:48.80]It's perfect.
[27:51.44]I love it.
[27:52.62]It makes me happy.
[27:54.13]Watch out for this fucking boogeyman.
[28:02.51]This just branched out like crazy.
[28:07.77]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[28:25.44]Right, I mean, like, let's shut this guy up, like, at this point.
[28:28.14]We've heard all, we've heard, like, the same fucking four one-liners.
[28:30.62]Let's shut him the fuck up.
[28:34.77]Real right right my we all in agreeance on that It was cool for the first like four hours five hours of the game but like alright like I'm done And plus why the fuck would he be talking right now?
[28:51.79]I'm not playing as Seth I'll mute you
[29:02.32]Am I right?
[29:02.70]Am I right, fellas?
[29:03.49]Am I right?
[29:08.51]I got a feeling this is going to be a long run.
[29:09.89]It's going to be a good one.
[29:11.83]I think.
[29:15.56]Seth is your god?
[29:17.86]Is it?
[29:20.34]Can you now shut the... Alright, yeah, ready?
[29:22.08]I'll shut up now.
[29:22.66]Ready?
[29:23.00]Do you want a silent stream?
[29:24.21]Fine.
[29:30.23]Here you go.
[29:30.59]Here's your silent tryhard stream.
[29:33.13]We'll do that in like 10 seconds.
[29:35.01]Because I have something to say to that guy that just told me to shut up.
[29:41.83]Fuck you.
[29:42.29]I don't know.
[29:44.37]I don't know.
[29:45.85]Just pretend I said something witty and mean to the guy that just told me to shut up.
[29:53.42]Mean's not the right answer there.
[29:54.74]Not mean.
[29:56.80]Witty and flavorful.
[30:13.97]Why is he still talking?
[30:16.89]I told you I was gonna do that in 10 seconds.
[30:22.23]Alright, you want me to change my stream title to, like, Immortal Redneck.
[30:25.38]Having fun, like, in brackets.
[30:27.22]No mic.
[30:29.64]Just unplug my mic.
[30:32.92]This room actually really sucks.
[30:38.34]This is not cool.
[30:42.62]Actually took way, way too much damage.
[30:47.12]Have a cam, but no mic and just be talking.
[30:50.98]No, because then people will, that's like such a Twitch meme.
[30:54.37]People will come in and say like, muted, muted, and it's like, I know, that joke is so dumb.
[30:59.33]Isn't that like a twitch.tv joke?
[31:04.31]Like streamers, mic is muted and they can like tell me and it's funny, right?
[31:23.15]Look at me.
[31:23.57]I'm Jerma.
[31:24.09]I'm muted.
[31:24.61]Oh, yeah.
[31:25.25]I forgot about that last screen.
[31:26.21]I kind of almost predicted my movements.
[31:28.91]Ooh, new gun.
[31:30.19]Is it worth replacing the sword?
[31:32.99]Yeah.
[31:33.97]Probably.
[31:34.35]I think it's area of effect.
[31:35.75]Might as well use it.
[31:38.51]Have the camera pointed at the...
[31:47.29]Alright, when I take my... Oh, we're gonna set that up.
[31:49.09]That's gonna be funny.
[31:53.07]Set the camera up pointing at the microphone.
[31:57.67]And have it say, no mic today.
[32:01.21]It's like, yeah, actually, you very clearly have a mic.
[32:04.53]No mic, sorry.
[32:05.84]With like a sad face.
[32:08.28]No mic and the camera's pointing at the... Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.
[32:16.35]I'm getting unlucky, because I should have found these by now.
[32:24.97]Okay, nice joke.
[32:25.71]We'll do that for like five minutes.
[32:28.09]But I currently have Darth Vader pajama pants on and no shirt, so I can't like... I'm dressed like a fucking nine-year-old right now, guys.
[32:37.27]So, no.
[32:38.77]I'm like ready for bed.
[32:39.67]I'm like a ten-year-old ready for bed.
[32:43.05]I have my Darth Vader pants on, my little comfy pants, and no clothes.
[32:49.13]I love Star Wars.
[32:50.07]It's my favorite movie.
[32:50.79]What does the flare gun do?
[33:01.65]Reminds me of TF2, and I know, and I stopped making TF2 references, I know, but like, this thing sucks.
[33:12.10]Why can't this be as good as the TF2 flare gun?
[33:14.84]Stop making Team Fortress references.
[33:16.68]Stop doing that.
[33:17.34]I just did it again.
[33:19.92]Comedy streamer.
[33:22.18]What did somebody say about a comedy stream?
[33:25.36]Is it this stream you're talking about?
[33:31.91]Hey, Cyanide.
[33:32.49]Thanks for the five bucks.
[33:33.85]Hey, Jerma played Dead Cells after this.
[33:35.65]It looks like tons of fun.
[33:36.71]Actually, Etalyx was playing that the other day.
[33:38.39]It actually does look very fun.
[33:43.81]So maybe I would try that one day on this livestream website.
[33:48.85]Twitter.TV.
[33:50.95]Just wait until Twitter gets involved, right?
[33:53.69]You know, YouTube got involved, YouTube Live, but YouTube Live ain't good.
[34:00.43]Facebook Live, just wait for Twitter Live.
[34:03.31]You have 140 seconds to stream.
[34:05.54]Can't wait for that.
[34:10.82]You better say what you want to say, because you'll get 140 seconds.
[34:29.03]Check out Nightmares.
[34:33.04]There are a lot of games that I want to play.
[34:34.64]There's just not enough time in the world to play them.
[34:38.52]There's a lot of great titles.
[34:39.84]I want to play Until Dawn.
[34:41.76]There's like eight or nine dumb full motion video games that I have to play that I want to play so badly.
[34:49.42]Weapons will automatically reload when they're not active.
[34:51.44]Well, thank God, because I can't reload, so it'll reload for me.
[34:54.44]Thank you, game.
[34:54.92]Is that it?
[35:02.98]I think so, alright.
[35:04.86]Make sure I didn't miss anything down here.
[35:07.22]Yeah, we're good.
[35:12.36]No mic, no video.
[35:14.48]Yeah, but then it would just be a black screen.
[35:18.46]People would leave.
[35:19.92]At least with the cam on the mic and not me talking, people will have questions.
[35:32.63]Like, people will have a funny question.
[35:38.84]Ow.
[35:41.38]You can't really miss with that thing, though.
[35:42.72]That's the good thing.
[35:52.79]You guys are the easiest enemies that could have spawned here.
[35:55.87]A bunch of melee enemies.
[35:58.51]Good work, everybody.
[36:08.00]To the left.
[36:11.67]Point the cam into the monitor and stream the cam view.
[36:15.31]You're getting into the weird infinite mirrors thing.
[36:18.89]Where you'll just see the same image like a thousand times.
[36:21.13]That was not fair.
[36:22.73]That wasn't fair.
[36:23.37]They spawned like right on top of me.
[36:25.64]What is this?
[36:27.12]Nuke Town?
[36:29.60]What is this?
[36:30.10]Call of Duty Advanced Warfare 2?
[36:32.22]Ow.
[36:45.88]You know what I'm saying guys?
[36:46.64]What is this?
[36:47.02]Call of Duty?
[36:49.21]Call of Duty 2?
[36:49.97]Remember that spawn?
[36:54.15]Who remembers the spawn mechanic in Call of Duty 3?
[36:58.14]Anybody remember how crazy that was?
[37:00.18]I don't because I didn't play that game.
[37:02.16]Maybe one of you guys remembers it though.
[37:17.27]Took way too many hits in here.
[37:21.53]No one plays it.
[37:23.01]Really?
[37:23.31]I thought that was a popular one.
[37:33.62]Let's try to hit.
[37:35.96]There you go.
[37:36.48]Jerma is making up stories again.
[37:39.86]Yeah, but ban that guy.
[37:41.51]Anybody that talks about my made-up shit, fucking get rid of them.
[37:45.71]I'm making no jokes right now.
[37:47.69]I just took a lot of damage.
[37:53.11]I was going to make a stupid reference, and I'm not going to do that right now, and I'm going to die.
[38:09.03]I thought this thing reloads by... Ayy!
[38:11.08]Gun!
[38:12.12]Didn't I get a scroll that did that?
[38:14.18]Or is it being negated by the other one that I got earlier?
[38:20.03]It's kind of annoying.
[38:24.25]I don't want to kill them yet, because if they drop something, I want it.
[38:29.91]I only beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[38:31.70]It's the easiest one.
[38:32.84]What?! !
[38:34.64]Dark Souls 3 is not the easiest one.
[38:36.54]Dark Souls 2 is easier than Dark Souls 3.
[38:38.86]By a long shot.
[38:42.90]Dark Souls 2 did not give me very much trouble at all, actually.
[38:46.40]It was like maybe one or two areas that I thought were like fairly difficult.
[38:49.34]But Dark Souls 3 was way harder than Dark Souls 2.
[38:59.12]Dark Souls 3 is not easier than Dark Souls 2.
[39:03.31]The last boss in Dark Souls 2, the fucking, like, Sludge Zordon.
[39:09.33]What was the guy's name?
[39:10.01]Not Zordon.
[39:11.33]Oh my god, it was so dumb.
[39:12.31]What was his name?
[39:14.39]Don't say, don't, like, don't spoil it.
[39:15.73]Don't spoil it.
[39:18.23]Who's Zed?
[39:19.97]Zed from Power Rangers.
[39:21.17]Like, half his body comes up.
[39:22.97]That'll suck.
[39:24.85]Zed, oh yeah, watch out for scary Zed from Power Rangers.
[39:28.09]Like, mannequin chest up, comes out of the ground.
[39:34.72]Why am I making fun of Dark Souls 2?
[39:37.48]I liked that game.
[39:39.32]Not as much as Dark Souls 3, but I did.
[39:54.51]Hello!
[39:55.62]I hear more of you goats, and I hate you.
[40:01.96]Most people think 3 is easier.
[40:04.97]Some of those bosses in 3 were, like, obnoxious.
[40:11.25]I want to replace this.
[40:15.94]2's bosses I don't think are really that difficult.
[40:19.12]I'm trying to think of, like, a Dark Souls 2 boss that I really, really, like, just dropped, like, hours on.
[40:24.65]Like, a couple of them in Dark Souls 3.
[40:36.19]Chairman died on the Deacons.
[40:37.21]No, I didn't.
[40:37.99]I beat the Deacons first try.
[40:40.11]Oh, excuse me.
[40:40.75]Sorry.
[40:41.13]I also beat Champion Gundyr first try.
[40:43.79]And Dancer of the Boreal Valley first try.
[40:46.75]And... Who else did I... I first... You guys all watched it.
[40:51.11]I played the whole damn thing on stream.
[40:52.14]I beat the game on stream.
[40:53.86]I beat that game on stream.
[40:54.98]Like, fucking pretty commendable.
[40:56.98]First of all, pretty commendable.
[40:59.24]I like first tried like four or five bosses.
[41:07.42]He goes again.
[41:17.18]It's so funny.
[41:18.04]You guys, like, somebody just straight up, like, was facepalming right there.
[41:22.58]But I can't beat the first pyramid.
[41:24.06]What?
[41:24.46]This is a game about, like, upgrades.
[41:27.43]I had to get, like, upgraded first.
[41:29.05]Now I'm all, like, ready to go and upgraded.
[41:30.65]Were you making a this joke or were you making a that joke?
[41:34.57]I don't know.
[41:35.85]Which joke were you making?
[41:41.92]Those of you guys that were here to watch me beat Champion Gundyr first try, like, please defend me in the chat.
[41:47.55]Because there are people thinking that I'm a liar right now when I say that.
[41:51.45]Yeah, sorry guys.
[41:52.41]Like, Jerma985 beat Champion Gundyr in less tries than you.
[41:57.84]How does that make you feel?
[42:05.72]somewhere okay some somewhere in the world right now there is somebody right now watching this stream that is like fuck he's right somebody maybe like for you are doing that out of these like 1700 people moving speed okay that's kind of good
[42:32.00]I'm getting ready to beat this Baron.
[42:33.44]LiarGerman couldn't beat Super Meat Boy first try.
[42:36.16]What?
[42:36.42]I beat the fuck out of that game.
[42:37.85]I did like all the Bandage Girl levels too.
[42:41.53]And I did every single Dark World level on stream.
[42:45.31]I first tried every single Dark World level on stream.
[42:49.03]You guys don't remember that in like 2012?
[42:55.20]Back when I was good at video games.
[42:57.38]I beat every single fucking Dark World first try.
[43:02.65]You should have seen the amount of kappas that were in chat back then.
[43:05.47]Fuck me.
[43:08.71]It was crazy.
[43:10.23]There was so many kappas.
[43:11.37]Like, I didn't even know what to do.
[43:14.17]I was swimming in kappas.
[43:15.03]I didn't even know what to do with them all.
[43:19.95]I was swimming in them.
[43:20.93]I was, like, snorting kappas.
[43:27.13]Like, you mean, like, the only emote that, like, existed in 2012?
[43:32.47]Maybe there were more, I don't even remember.
[43:38.70]What is that?
[43:40.22]Do I want that?
[43:52.29]I don't think I want this grenade launcher, right?
[43:55.18]No, no.
[43:57.60]I like the precision with this.
[43:58.60]I like the damage with this, and I like the range and precision .2 with this.
[44:14.67]Thanks for ruining shit.
[44:15.53]What did I do?
[44:17.39]Oh.
[44:17.85]Somebody's writing that.
[44:18.69]Oh, okay.
[44:20.08]Alright, here we go.
[44:22.66]Stop doing that, everybody.
[44:25.80]You understand?
[44:26.48]Stop it.
[44:28.54]See, now they'll listen.
[44:29.28]They're gonna listen to the captain of the boat.
[44:33.19]Alright, you hear me, guys?
[44:34.33]Stop doing that.
[44:36.05]Come on.
[44:37.15]Stop it.
[44:38.87]You gotta listen to your captain.
[44:46.67]See, I'm looking over right now.
[44:47.59]See, they're listening to me.
[44:50.23]My children.
[44:51.37]My wonderful children.
[44:52.63]All my 1700 children.
[44:58.18]See, look at how much they're listening to me.
[45:00.72]I don't see any more.
[45:03.50]I don't see any more.
[45:07.38]Look at how much they're listening to me.
[45:11.78]Let's beat this guy first try without taking one hit.
[45:21.13]We need to replace that.
[45:34.08]We gotta wait till he does this dumb thing, and now we can hurt him!
[45:43.76]Well, I missed a lot, but it's okay.
[45:55.32]I'm missing a lot.
[46:01.40]Now let's just use the spam gun.
[46:08.99]I'm missing a lot, but you know, let's just use... Didn't even get hit one time.
[46:27.74]Didn't even get touched.
[46:34.08]There's some squirrels here.
[46:39.25]Jerma does this for a living.
[46:40.79]And yeah, yeah, he sure does collect those fucking diamonds.
[46:45.13]No, no, that's not, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[46:46.67]That's not what I meant.
[46:47.41]Hold on.
[46:47.79]I gotta, we have to rephrase this.
[46:49.77]I did not mean, I was talking about like collecting the diamond.
[46:52.76]Like I'm, I get like, I get the job done in the game.
[46:54.96]Not like I collect money.
[46:56.76]That's not what I meant by that.
[46:58.72]Let's make that very fucking clear before we keep going.
[47:08.11]Anytime you receive damage, a dome of fire will appear around you automatically.
[47:13.19]And, like, the shitty version, the non-automatic version of this.
[47:19.45]That's not what I meant, and you all know it.
[47:23.00]And it's so bad because that looked like a bit symbol.
[47:26.58]That was a golden bit symbol.
[47:30.20]Oh, god damn it.
[47:31.44]Oh, well.
[47:32.86]Yeah, I picked up, like, the fucking in-game bit.
[47:37.63]Thank you for the bits.
[47:42.71]I only play games for money.
[47:44.89]No, that's not true.
[47:52.14]Someone say money.
[47:54.66]Thank you, Radical Corgi.
[47:57.84]No, I'm not just a bit streamer.
[47:59.28]Don't put me in that category.
[48:02.95]I'm much more than that!
[48:04.81]Look at me!
[48:05.37]Look at- Watch this!
[48:06.10]Ready?
[48:06.42]If I miss one shot, then I'm a fucking- I'm a bit gamer.
[48:09.06]If I land every single precision shot, then I'm a good gamer.
[48:12.24]I'm not a bit gamer.
[48:13.00]Not a bit sellout gamer.
[48:14.20]Here we go!
[48:15.36]One!
[48:17.91]Two!

[48:25.09]I'm a bit gamer!
[48:28.49]No way!
[48:28.91]Well, I got distracted by like the explosions.
[48:33.02]I got distracted by the explosions.
[48:34.69]None of that counted.
[48:37.45]Did you see what was happening?
[48:38.53]Like, that was freaking me out.
[48:39.73]Not a bit gamer.
[48:42.19]Alright, part two.
[48:43.17]If I miss one shot, then I'm a fucking bit.TV gamer.

[50:45.71]I think we can do some repairs to the boat.
[50:50.19]Hold on a second.
[50:51.16]Let's be real here for a second.
[50:52.72]The stream... This is a better stream now.
[50:57.70]I'm running on like a medium CPU preset at 60 FPS clean 720p right now and that I mean this is the ship with you guys helped make this ship so I mean like right this is the look that stream looks great doesn't it Dracula oh God core monster Core monster just dropped $50 as well says sellout streamer unsubbing well you just get 50 bucks you just subbed like fucking like 30 times

[52:01.32]Is that what that is?
[52:04.02]I just got a severance package from a subscriber.
[52:08.05]That's so funny.
[52:11.11]Oh boy, crazy room.
[52:14.45]I just took so many hits.
[52:16.09]That was not good.
[52:16.87]I have a lot of money though.
[52:28.62]Slim Jim, thank you for the seven bucks.
[52:30.15]Donating to Sellout Streamers Retirement Fund.
[52:33.27]Thank you for the $7.
[52:34.41]Also, thank you to... What is your name?
[52:36.89]Colonel Custard?
[52:38.33]Is your name Custard Colonel?
[52:40.55]Thank you for the $10.
[52:41.51]And to think I might have... I thought I subbed to a full gamer.
[52:45.56]And to think I thought I subbed to a full gamer.
[52:48.04]Well, at least I am a... At least I'm a gamer, right?
[52:51.46]Okay, for a second, that noise, I thought was like another... I thought that was more bits.
[52:54.78]That noise that was in my ear right there.
[52:56.40]It was like, ding, ding, ding!
[52:57.28]I was like, oh shit, more bits.
[53:00.22]But thank you, guys.
[53:05.61]Somebody give me 25 bits.
[53:07.69]Ross Kemp said, have a bit, bitch streamer.
[53:10.19]Thanks for the 25 bits.
[53:10.81]Oh, shit.
[53:11.55]Is this the furthest I've gotten in this game?
[53:22.19]In like the 24 hours I've played it?
[53:25.27]I haven't played it that long, have I?
[53:30.05]No, I haven't.
[53:31.75]Not that long.
[53:36.41]Thankfully, you guys still take one hit.
[53:37.94]Because that would be really annoying if you didn't.
[53:43.70]Follower only mode?
[53:46.10]Is that how that works?
[53:50.66]That might make a little sense at some point.
[53:52.62]Just because, like, if you, like... I don't know.
[53:58.92]Maybe for, like, spam moments, you know?
[54:09.06]Maybe for, like, a... When it gets, like, spammy, I could imagine... Hey, Sarah!
[54:16.23]Just wanted to say, what's going on?
[54:17.15]Jerma985 here.
[54:18.09]Wanted to say congratulations on that new job.
[54:21.41]At Ulta.
[54:22.21]Working at Ulta now.
[54:23.29]Nice job.
[54:23.97]Sriracha!
[54:24.68]That's your name, because you're, like, a little spicy, right?
[54:26.66]Something like that.
[54:27.48]Congratulations on that job.
[54:29.20]Sarah, hope you have a good, uh... Hope you have a good day.
[54:35.07]That's a dead joke.
[54:36.69]No, it's a dead joke when I say it's a dead joke This is my boat If I want to do the Sarah joke again, I'm gonna do it And then I'm gonna drown you understand shit and now I'm like getting angry I Have this too many things on the screen for me to my brain to comprehend it.
[55:03.25]Oh
[55:04.34]If I get this shot, I'm a real gamer if I get this shot.
[55:10.67]That one.
[55:15.17]Alright, I'm a real gamer if I get this shot.
[55:16.77]I swear to God, this is the one.
[55:17.69]If I don't get this shot, then the ship's going down.
[55:22.27]Okay, we're good.
[55:27.03]I like this money, though.
[55:27.71]I have a lot.
[55:28.07]I got 8200 bits.
[55:29.22]It's going good so far.
[55:34.18]right click more yeah yeah I know what's that whoa what's the super soaker I don't think I've ever seen this potato launcher okay well is this a joke gun though I got a feeling this is going to be like kind of a joke gun this is not going to do anything
[56:05.59]We'll find out very shortly, right?
[56:07.91]Hopefully this isn't just a funny gun that doesn't do anything.
[56:11.12]Whatever.
[56:12.78]Let's find out.
[56:26.44]I mean, it kind of sucks.
[56:29.23]I think it's a joke.
[56:29.93]That's an 8400-bit joke.
[56:30.73]That's an $84 joke.
[56:31.31]Gun.
[56:38.13]Does it even fit an ammo?
[56:39.50]No.
[56:43.60]I mean, the potatoes bounce around.
[56:48.14]Maybe.
[56:49.02]Might be worth it in like crowded rooms.
[56:56.60]That was... What is it with the spawn shit?
[56:58.58]Like in this particular, like this room in particular, right?
[57:11.12]Nah, it's a fucking... It's a goddamn joke gun.
[57:13.50]No.
[57:14.60]I'm getting rid of that the second I can.
[57:16.16]I'm not using a joke gun on this stream.
[57:18.24]This is a serious stream.
[57:21.96]We don't make any shitty potato gun jokes on this stream.
[57:31.47]There's the elevator going up.
[57:41.83]Jesus.
[57:54.28]Whoa!
[58:02.06]Hello?
[58:05.80]Hello?
[58:08.50]We got another boss coming up after this floor.
[58:10.38]Sixth floor, right?
[58:13.24]I think.
[58:13.56]One more of you!
[58:29.45]I wish I could- Come on, grab the edge, man!
[58:31.18]What?
[58:31.44]In the name of God!
[58:32.82]Come on.
[58:37.66]Where is this la- I hate this little hidden nonsense.
[58:46.52]Okay.
[58:48.10]There we go.
[58:49.04]Get the money.
[58:50.78]Get that money.
[58:52.08]I need that money.
[58:52.94]Get it.
[58:55.50]Can't let a fucking couple of bits just go to waste.
[59:00.40]Jeremy, you're very angry at me.
[59:01.50]What?
[59:01.82]Why are you angry with me?
[59:13.36]Uh, thank you Medieval Karma for the two bucks.
[59:15.68]They say cheer 100, cheer 100.
[59:17.42]Thank you.
[59:19.74]Also, Gear Dude, Sticks Renegade, and Fire Ant TV.
[59:22.68]Thanks for the bits.
[59:23.96]Because the last of my cereal money says Fire Ant TV.
[59:29.22]Well, I mean, that's... I feel kind of bad about that, Fire Ant.
[59:33.61]I mean, you could have... You weighed, like, another, like... Another $2 there.
[59:37.81]Another, like, $1.45, and you've got a... You've got, like, at least two balls of Captain Grudge.
[59:43.57]You got a full Captain Crunch box.
[59:48.63]Okay.
[59:49.19]Everybody is so, so tanky now.
[59:52.73]I think I'm at the stage where my guys... I don't think I'm strong enough because everyone's 60% harder to kill and 100% more damage.
[60:00.07]I don't have that yet.
[60:01.89]This character... I'm not leveled up enough.
[60:05.29]We'll see.
[60:07.61]That's a new weapon.
[60:12.09]Alright, a sniper rifle.
[60:14.17]Yeah, I will definitely gladly get rid of... No, don't, don't, don't, don't!
[60:18.36]Wait a minute, there's too many birds up here.
[60:22.62]And I think somebody just gave a fucking hundred dollars.
[60:25.34]So I need to like, hold on.
[60:26.84]I have a sniper rifle.
[60:28.50]Get rid of the fucking potato gun.
[60:32.24]Give me one second, hold on.
[60:33.35]This is the furthest I've gotten so far.
[60:36.07]Alright, let's see.
[60:39.11]What do they say?
[60:39.77]Somebody gave a hundred bucks.
[60:44.08]Wait, let me just get these extra bits.
[60:46.32]A lot of bits up here.
[60:47.12]Okay.
[60:48.92]Oh, it's Primrose the Great again.
[60:51.35]They gave $100.
[60:51.71]And they said... Did somebody say need more bits?
[60:59.38]jermaRat Ratstreamer.
[61:05.26]I didn't say need more bits.
[61:09.16]But thank you for the 100 bucks, Primrose.
[61:12.00]Thank you for your, like, $200 so far.
[61:15.99]150, 200.
[61:16.07]Fucking ridiculous.
[61:20.85]We're almost... In game, I need to get to 10,000.
[61:23.35]Because then it would make sense.
[61:25.87]It's too bad that I didn't get to 10,000 and, like, bang, there's your bits.
[61:32.34]It'll probably happen in this room, though.
[61:36.58]What, I'm a rat streamer?
[61:39.09]I thought you guys already knew that.
[61:42.53]I want to use the snipe rifle.
[61:43.99]And he just gets no scoped!
[61:46.95]I mean, there's no scope this guy too.
[61:50.67]There's no scope that guy too!
[61:53.95]No scope that guy.
[61:55.73]Fuck.
[61:56.27]Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[62:01.87]It's seriously fucking Widowmaker.
[62:03.67]But like, I'm making all these awful jokes and I'm getting killed.
[62:09.62]No more awful jokes.
[62:11.40]Just like win.
[62:12.46]Because I want to see what the next boss is.
[62:30.06]I was just trying to go up and melee him.
[62:32.41]Like by hitting the middle mouse button.
[62:34.39]What the fuck am I thinking?
[62:51.47]I don't know if I like this.
[62:52.73]This game is way too fast-paced for me to like this.
[63:01.05]It's weird.
[63:02.05]You hold down left mouse button and you let left mouse button go to shoot.
[63:06.45]It's kind of freaking me out a little.
[63:11.39]And the sensitivity is all whacked out when you zoom in.
[63:15.67]Excuses.
[63:20.62]Does a lot of damage, though.
[63:29.81]Those guys are so good when you have the scroll that gives you health when you kill an enemy.
[63:33.49]They're perfect.
[63:36.29]Because I get the full health.
[63:39.70]Get the full health in a heartbeat.
[63:48.19]I would have three times the scrolls.
[63:49.55]Yeah, I'd also, if I had Twitch integration on, I'd have three times the scrolls.
[63:52.75]I'd also be three times as dead.
[63:55.99]Because you guys would give me, like, booger scrolls.
[64:02.42]Would I play Lisa on stream?
[64:07.70]All my friends and roommates think it's weird that I use middle mouse button for melee, but you use it too.
[64:12.22]It's normal, right?
[64:12.98]Yeah, that's what I would use.
[64:14.44]And this is, like, this looks pretty major.
[64:19.44]Okay, this is definitely like a major boss.
[64:21.34]Yeah, it is.
[64:21.88]Okay, I don't know what's going to happen here, so... Let's go with tried and true.
[64:27.12]Precision.
[64:28.84]This is like a major boss.
[64:30.46]Everybody wish me luck.
[64:31.38]I have 9,700 bits.
[64:35.37]It's going to be just like in Mario 64.
[64:39.65]Those hands are going to come up, the eyeballs are going to be on them, and it's going to do like a smash move.
[64:43.23]Got it.
[64:50.69]Yep.
[64:56.91]In that case.
[64:57.45]Is that not hurting him for some reason?
[65:11.42]I don't know why.
[65:11.96]In the eyes, maybe?
[65:19.44]Oh my god!
[65:20.34]What the fuck was that?
[65:24.10]Okay, I... How the fuck was I supposed to know that was gonna happen?
[65:29.29]How do you hurt this guy?
[65:38.06]Uh...
[65:52.08]Okay, well this wasn't fucking fair.
[65:55.68]I saw an eye.
[65:58.04]Why are these eyes not open?
[66:01.34]I...
[66:22.11]Does he have something under his ass?
[66:24.91]That doesn't hurt him.
[66:29.41]I'm dead.
[66:31.14]Okay, that was dumb.
[66:41.98]I shot the green blobs and it didn't do anything.
[66:49.65]Okay.
[66:52.27]The green light flashed when you shot it.
[66:54.09]Well, what the fuck?
[66:55.41]How the fuck was I supposed to know any of that shit was going to happen?
[67:03.40]After you break one of the green blobs, it turned to yellow.
[67:06.56]Who gives a shit?
[67:10.91]He's like doing all this fucked up stuff.
[67:12.49]That was the first I've ever seen that guy.
[67:14.07]It's just like Dark Souls.
[67:15.43]Everybody calm down.
[67:16.39]I want to try her.
[67:30.25]You guys are bullshit!
[67:31.67]That's not what you're supposed to do.
[67:36.75]You guys are lying to me.
[67:38.11]I didn't even make it to 10,000 bits.
[67:39.05]Hold on a second.
[67:39.85]You guys want to help?
[67:55.00]Here, you guys can help this time.
[67:59.66]I think I have to... Hold on, let me... Let's do this first.
[68:10.27]I want... More defense.
[68:15.95]More health.
[68:21.40]More health.
[68:24.72]um gold rush chest drop a topaz in addition to regular rewards more money I don't know what do you guys think it's okay Jerma you're just overwhelmed this is the first time this is the first time I've seen it come on I can't like be expected to see like a major game boss and instantly beat him
[68:53.29]Guys, you have to read the book before you understand what the book is.
[68:56.29]You can't go buy a book from the fucking bookstore, hold it in your hand and go, yeah, I know, I read it.
[69:01.79]Like, no, you read the book.
[69:03.48]There's a first page and a last page.
[69:06.06]What are you guys, just like hold it down and flip it like a flip book and say you read the book?
[69:10.30]That's not how it works.
[69:10.94]You have to read the book.
[69:13.32]You don't just hold it and like press the book into your face and go like, breathe in and go, yeah, I know what happens.
[69:37.58]I love us already wrote.
[69:38.46]What the fuck is a bookstore?
[69:41.60]What character am I playing?
[69:43.74]Amunet?
[69:44.06]I don't know.
[69:46.74]I'm going to do this.
[69:49.71]That was such a waste of money, but you know what?
[69:51.69]Fuck it.
[69:51.97]We're doing topaz in every chest.
[69:56.75]And we're also going to buy a scroll.
[69:59.29]And I'm going to turn on Twitch integration.
[70:00.84]What a mistake that's going to be, but I'm going to do it.
[70:06.71]Wow, this guy's a dick.
[70:07.99]Why do you guys... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[70:09.81]Oxy91.

[70:13.23]He's not a follower.
[70:14.33]And he doesn't have a thing next to him.
[70:16.21]I want to make sure this person's very clear.
[70:17.71]Oxy91, I'm talking to you.
[70:18.91]I'm talking to you directly.
[70:20.05]I'm talking to you directly.
[70:22.61]We're just messing around.
[70:23.25]We're just having fun.
[70:24.74]Like, nobody in this chat, like, thinks I'm a dumb shithead and doesn't, like, like me.
[70:28.62]And I think I love everybody here.
[70:29.88]Like, Oxy91.
[70:30.08]Don't worry.
[70:30.40]We're okay.
[70:35.63]Nobody in this stream thinks I'm a fucking idiot and thinks I suck.
[70:38.87]Everybody's fucking, they're all here because they think I'm cool and I think they're cool, right?
[70:43.81]Right?
[70:45.39]Come on.
[70:53.19]Golden scroll.
[70:55.65]Golden scroll.
[70:56.71]Alright, let me turn on... I'll do one more without Twitch interaction.
[71:01.19]One more without Twitch interaction.
[71:02.87]One more.
[71:04.12]I'm gonna be the last one without Twitch interaction.
[71:06.28]And this time, we're going fast.
[71:07.68]We're gonna go really fast.
[71:14.25]No, we're not modding Oxy.
[71:16.13]We're not doing it.
[71:16.85]No, we did this joke.
[71:18.07]You guys are rehashing a joke.
[71:23.97]No joke rehashing.
[71:26.24]We've already done this.
[71:28.60]But I'm going fast.
[71:33.27]What is her active?
[71:33.87]I don't even remember.
[71:34.55]Okay, it's the invisibility with the taunt.
[71:38.95]Okay.
[71:47.80]Let's go speedy here.
[71:49.53]Thank you for the speed.
[71:50.39]That's exactly what I wanted.
[71:51.37]Fast.
[71:52.57]Fast.
[72:00.91]These guys sound like Jim Brewer's goat boy.
[72:03.21]How many of you guys know what I'm talking about?
[72:06.69]Where's our 1, 2, 3?
[72:07.65]Oh, chest.
[72:08.09]Here's our first Topaz.
[72:09.53]You guys didn't think that was worth it?
[72:10.60]Dropping like $5,000?
[72:11.08]Well, it was, because here comes a Topaz.
[72:17.28]Beautiful.
[72:20.38]Already up to fucking almost 1,000 bits.
[72:22.88]Enemies explode when they die.
[72:23.94]That's cool.
[72:25.61]I don't think I want that.
[72:26.83]It's just a dumb grenade launcher.
[72:28.09]No, I don't.
[72:28.73]Let's go.
[72:36.59]And that, actually, that's not a good thing, because it hurts me.
[72:43.39]Like, already in trouble.
[72:55.96]I can't kill people when they're close to me now.
[73:00.99]Goddammit, I can't get any of this.
[73:06.46]Wow, we went the wrong way.
[73:07.68]Well, that was cool.
[73:18.44]Thanks for the explosion.
[73:30.55]Yep.
[73:32.07]Yep.
[73:39.37]Faster than the speed of light.
[73:42.21]How do I get up there, though?
[73:50.37]Why is my main channel dead?
[73:52.53]Well, the main channel is going to have a couple of videos uploaded this summer.
[73:58.12]One of which, in particular, is going to be a very, very, very expensive video.
[74:04.24]But it's going to be worth it, I hope.
[74:07.16]It'll be fun.
[74:12.01]And then I can be like the guy that uploads a huge $30,000 video once a year.
[74:17.01]This just in.
[74:20.79]Streamer YouTuber drains entire life savings to make... I almost just said what it was.
[74:26.73]Good thing I didn't.
[74:30.91]I actually kind of wish I did.
[74:33.68]So then you guys would be like, what the fuck are you... I'm going to say it.
[74:36.34]You want me to say it?
[74:38.10]You want me to say what it is?
[74:41.08]No, I can't.
[74:43.11]I can't.
[74:43.37]It's too important.
[74:48.02]How the fuck did you do that, but I can't?
[74:54.88]No, it's just... I'll give you hints, like, when it gets closer.
[74:58.85]Like, in a few months.
[74:59.59]Like, seven months.
[75:01.93]Twelve months.
[75:02.69]Like, next fucking year when this comes out.
[75:19.97]No, it is not wrestling.
[75:22.57]That's all I'll tell you.
[75:23.97]Not wrestling.
[75:25.83]Although that is going to happen, but that's not what I'm talking about.
[75:28.50]That's not the video I'm referring to.
[75:31.60]Not what I'm currently referring to.
[75:34.30]But yes, that is going to happen at some point.
[75:46.87]Is it the school play?
[75:49.60]Mean like that no that's one of them That's that is unrelated, but that is one of the videos is going to be made not this one New scroll chance of freezing the enemy with each hit fantastic because this thing is a machine gun so that's gonna be utilized very much, so I
[76:21.63]How's the splash damage on that?
[76:33.50]Good?
[76:37.56]It's a little more to be desired, potentially.
[76:44.10]Don't get too close to me, buddy.
[76:52.53]That guy just went into fucking space.
[77:03.56]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[77:11.83]Hey, Daddy Phil!
[77:14.87]Hey, Dad.
[77:15.63]Hey, Daddy.
[77:17.93]Notorious bit streamer, Jerma985, dances on webcam for every donation.
[77:22.35]That is not true, but thank you.
[77:23.97]Thank you, Dad, for the $5.
[77:27.39]Thank you for the $5, Dad.
[77:28.17]Okay.
[77:28.43]Well, thank you, Dad, for the $5.
[77:35.91]Also, thank you to MostlyLost for the $3.
[77:40.39]It says, here you go.
[77:47.90]Thank you.
[77:48.74]Thank you, MostlyLux.
[77:56.02]Don't want that to explode!
[77:57.72]Fuck, this is horrible.
[78:01.71]Because I couldn't kill that guy because he would have exploded on me.
[78:06.19]I think I got out of there alright.
[78:07.81]I think I did that okay.
[78:10.62]That was pretty good, I think.
[78:12.56]I did alright.
[78:16.82]Over here.
[78:18.98]I knew that was going to happen.
[78:20.26]What a dumbass.
[78:22.84]This is not the right way.
[78:27.96]Those snakes didn't die from the splash damage?
[78:31.02]Are you kidding me right now?
[78:33.54]Are you kidding me?
[78:45.07]Oh!
[78:49.59]I love how you guys are slowly coming down the stairs and it's actually making it worse.
[78:56.20]Oh, by the way.
[78:57.52]Sorry about those sapphires.
[79:03.02]You guys want an old joke?
[79:04.74]You want an old reference?
[79:05.67]There you go.
[79:07.13]This is a nostalgia stream.
[79:09.51]Put on your nostalgia glasses, guys.
[79:11.09]We're going back like two months.
[79:12.59]We're going back like three months.
[79:14.21]Put on your nostalgia glasses.
[79:16.87]We're going back two months here.
[79:23.33]And door number four.
[79:24.83]Open it.
[79:25.63]This is not the right one.
[79:26.77]But it's a huge fucking room.
[79:34.42]Let's take out the precision here.
[79:43.92]No!
[79:45.33]I saw that in slow motion.
[79:46.57]It was like a car crashed.
[79:47.53]I could just see you fly through the window.
[79:53.52]Like that one character says.
[79:57.12]On that game.
[79:59.98]There's a chest here, though.
[80:03.98]Topaz and a pirate gun.
[80:10.47]I can't say I'm in love with this.
[80:12.09]I think I want to take... Yeah.
[80:14.51]Yeah, I'm not in love with that.
[80:15.75]I want it to be gone.
[80:26.74]Really?
[80:27.20]That hit the tiny little pixel right there?
[80:35.95]Grandpa's Blonde Device!
[80:37.31]Hit my head on the goddamn ceiling!
[80:44.42]Did you spawn right there?
[80:45.30]Of course you did.
[80:47.24]Why am I even asking that?
[80:49.84]Of course you did.
[80:57.79]Why does sometimes it not work?
[81:06.18]Still getting unlucky, too.
[81:10.28]What a joke.
[81:14.45]Let's go this way.
[81:17.77]What ever happened to Grandpa?
[81:18.75]He's still around.
[81:20.21]He's still kicking.
[81:26.65]Holy crap, you didn't die from that.
[81:28.25]Please.
[81:40.86]Snattocats are invisible, you are right.
[81:44.50]I just attacked my own dummy.
[81:59.73]I love when I fight my own shit that I put down.
[82:01.93]I distracted myself.
[82:08.47]Nothing even in here.
[82:09.23]This is not the speedrun that I wanted.
[82:14.56]This is not the type of fastness I wanted.
[82:27.17]I needed more than this and they're all gonna spawn.
[82:29.77]I hate this room.
[82:31.19]This is my least favorite procedurally generated room.
[82:35.77]This bullshit.
[82:36.85]When it's a giant staircase and these teleporting enemies.
[82:40.30]It is such shit.
[82:47.54]It is so shit.
[82:53.01]Wow, nice like fucking thumbnail.
[82:58.72]Reset the run.
[82:59.98]Why?
[83:01.62]It's not going that poorly, is it?
[83:02.96]I thought it was going pretty well.
[83:10.22]Thumbnail.
[83:11.73]Got it.
[83:16.35]Tortoise, your defense is higher when attacked from behind.
[83:18.95]Okay, that's good.
[83:21.25]I can be into that.
[83:29.01]No, back this way.
[83:32.69]Riding a timestamp.
[83:35.93]I think this is up.
[83:37.43]This one's up the stairs.
[83:53.68]Really, like, bullshit.
[83:55.62]I don't believe that for a second.
[84:06.36]I was about to say, how did none of you frogs get hit by that shit?
[84:12.31]I was about to be sorely disappointed.
[84:21.17]What's left?
[84:25.80]Ah!
[84:27.82]I don't like it when this happens.
[84:34.24]two guys do like idiots two dumb archers just sitting around uh this way apparently come on which one is the door not this one right no it's not the other one either
[84:54.76]I gotta be careful here, because they'll explode right on top of me if I kill them.
[85:05.71]Yeah.
[85:06.31]Yeah.
[85:06.97]Yeah.
[85:08.77]Yeah.
[85:08.99]Alright, I need a pee break.
[85:13.24]I need to get a pee break so I can make sure I don't show you guys my, like, anus on stream.
[85:23.53]What does that have to do with a P-Breaker?
[85:25.09]I don't know.
[85:25.49]Don't ask me.
[85:34.42]What?
[85:34.80]Somebody goes, what?
[85:38.46]Didn't fire.
[85:38.94]Anytime you receive damage, a dome will fire.
[85:40.78]Okay.
[85:46.56]That's not what I said.
[85:47.25]I was just misquoted.
[85:51.38]I said I don't want you guys to see my, like, my ASUS.
[85:54.06]My ASUS is... I have, like, an ASUS motherboard, and I don't want you guys to see it.
[85:59.91]I don't know.
[86:00.73]Some people get really annoyed with people having, like, not their motherboard that they like.
[86:05.91]I don't want you guys to see my ASUS.
[86:09.87]I know it's ASUS.
[86:10.75]I know.
[86:11.09]I know.
[86:12.68]I know.
[86:14.32]Trust me.
[86:14.92]I'm very, very much aware of it.
[86:17.50]Oh, no, actually, no, it's not ASUS.
[86:18.94]Shut up.
[86:19.62]I didn't say that.
[86:20.28]You did.
[86:32.04]What the fuck?
[86:36.04]You just came in and like puked.
[86:38.43]Hold on a second.
[86:39.25]Hold on.
[86:40.21]Hold on.
[86:40.69]I need like a second after that like puke.
[86:42.13]Wait, hold on.
[87:27.67]beer wait what
[89:34.90]Nobody leave.
[89:36.00]How many people left?
[89:38.08]Oh, man.
[89:38.56]How many people left?
[89:40.36]No, you don't leave.
[89:41.82]We're just getting to the good part.
[89:45.76]Oh, fuck.
[89:46.22]What happened?
[89:47.18]Hold on.
[89:50.46]There you go.
[89:55.96]Don't leave.
[89:56.50]We're just getting to the good part.
[90:00.12]Right now.
[90:01.99]Like 6, 4,000 people left.
[90:04.69]We're just getting to the fucking good part.
[90:06.05]I had like, I had like 6,000 people watching.
[90:08.63]We're just getting to the fucking good part.
[90:13.85]God damn it.
[90:14.31]I lost like fucking like, I had like 9,000 concurrent viewers.
[90:18.46]Now I'm down to fucking like, how many did I lose?
[90:22.72]9, 4,000?
[90:22.76]6,000?
[90:25.50]Double jump.
[90:26.06]Okay, that's amazing.
[90:28.16]I don't want this though.
[90:30.36]Actually, maybe I do want that.
[90:31.52]No, I don't.
[90:37.12]Although I'm getting money.
[90:38.09]That's good.
[90:39.11]Is there any more?
[90:39.79]Is there any more money?
[90:42.37]Holy mackerel the third.
[90:44.93]Oh, holy mack.
[90:45.57]Here he is.
[90:47.95]Uh, Jerma lay upon... As Jerma lay upon his deathbed, he took a
[90:54.35]breath and whispered to his loved ones.
[90:57.27]Should probably get started on that video soon.
[91:02.41]What?
[91:03.71]Thank you for the bits.
[91:07.95]I'm 400 subs away from 600,000 on the main channel.
[91:10.69]Well, that's cool.
[91:12.35]Thanks.
[91:13.89]Thanks all you viewers.
[91:17.21]Give us a rough estimate of when your next big main channel video is going out.
[91:22.29]Four years.
[91:24.11]So that means you'll be very surprised when it's not four years from now.
[91:28.05]So there you go with my rough estimate of how long it's going to take for the next video to be on the main channel.
[91:32.33]Four years.
[91:32.81]There you go.
[91:44.44]Thank you, Sarah.
[91:53.87]Alright, let's just get that out of the way because there's too many things going on right now.
[91:58.85]Too many explosions.
[92:07.69]Too many random assholes on the stairs launching giant grenades.
[92:10.51]This room is terrible.
[92:19.41]At least we found the exit.
[92:21.09]Right, boys and girls?
[92:24.00]Slug reduces movement speed.
[92:25.60]Well, that's... That actually sucks.
[92:31.30]Oh, that really sucks.
[92:32.80]That's so bad.
[92:35.43]It's just barely tapping.
[92:36.81]Ugh.
[92:39.97]Not cool.
[92:44.11]Hey, thanks for the subs.
[92:45.49]Thanks for the subs, people that just came in and subbed.
[92:47.15]I saw, like, at least two or three of them in a row there.
[92:49.30]Thank you.
[92:51.42]Still do need to get that thing worked on that make it so this is the sub solution I know I haven't been saying thank you and hello to the people that are subscribing and resubscribing but I Tell you know let's talk about that again.
[93:04.73]It's because in case somebody missed it in case you missed it.
[93:07.70]I'll talk about it now so subs and resubs at this point they're
[93:18.07]You know, I never wanted to get to a point where I'm just kind of... I have to, like, stop playing a game and just read names.
[93:23.05]Because, I mean, it's not like they happen every two seconds, but... I've been missing people.
[93:31.36]And I never wanted to get to a point where I'm just like, oh, fuck, I missed, like, so many people.
[93:35.90]And I say somebody else's name and not, like, yours.
[93:40.28]That was, like, an issue for a little while.
[93:41.90]And it was, like, irritating me because I obviously don't want to miss anybody.
[93:46.74]But I also don't want to have one of those streams where... I'm not even playing a game.
[93:53.06]I'm not even, like, doing, like, a stream.
[93:55.51]I'm just sitting here going like, Hey, thanks, so-and-so.
[93:59.15]Welcome to the fucking baby wipes.
[94:00.63]Like, thanks and welcome back, dude.
[94:02.35]See you later.
[94:03.15]Hey, and also to you, too.
[94:04.31]Welcome to the baby wipes.
[94:05.23]So we, like, wipe our asses with baby wipes here.
[94:08.24]Thanks for the... Like, I don't want to do that.
[94:09.80]Fucking for, like, 45 minutes straight.
[94:11.60]You know?
[94:11.80]I just don't want to do that.
[94:18.87]Uh, that Metamorphosis is okay.
[94:22.33]Proud baby wipes.
[94:23.75]Speaking of baby wipes, I need like some adult help right now.
[94:28.71]I need like an adult to help me because this room is fucking awful.
[94:32.77]But we made it through.
[94:36.50]Sort of.
[94:37.10]Yes, we did.
[94:42.28]Metamorphosize into a slug.
[94:55.22]I need to beat that first major boss.
[94:57.80]I need to beat the first damn pyramid.
[94:59.54]How am I ever going to start my pyramid scheme if I can't even create the pyramid?
[95:10.07]How am I going to function making my own pyramid scheme?
[95:14.03]I can't even do the first pyramid.
[95:18.52]It's not the right way, but shit in my face.
[95:22.01]Whoa.
[95:23.15]That got really graphic really quickly.
[95:25.89]There's a bug on me.
[95:34.37]A fucking bug crawled on me and now all of a sudden I'm like all screwed up.
[95:43.37]God.
[95:43.73]This is a disaster already.
[96:03.05]You ever eat your own boogers?
[96:08.11]I'm sorry.
[96:11.48]I'm sorry.
[96:12.06]That was uncalled for.
[96:16.42]God damn it.
[96:17.62]Holy fuck.
[96:18.28]I'm gonna fucking die.
[96:33.85]No!
[96:35.53]Don't kill them when they're near you.
[96:36.73]It does a lot of damage and it hurts.
[96:40.30]This run is so trash, by the way.
[96:42.02]These are nothing good.
[96:53.41]Who's left?
[96:53.91]One asshole.
[96:56.07]No meat either.
[96:56.79]Fantastic.
[97:00.47]It's a new low.
[97:01.24]I mean, it's a new high.
[97:22.60]Hmm. Yikes.
[97:24.60]Really? What the fuck did you even come from?
[97:27.60]Ah that's so annoying. Fuck that. Fuck that!
[97:32.60]Stop getting spawned like fucking behind. Ay! What did he come down the stairs or something? Fuck him.
[97:37.60]Use the escalator.
[97:43.60]God this is such a disaster.
[97:46.60]There's fucking archers everywhere.
[97:55.02]Y'know, I don't like this character either.
[97:56.32]Mm-mm.
[97:59.34]This is a solid no from me for this character.
[98:02.03]I'm not feeling it.
[98:07.33]I'd rather do a dickload of damage or be invincible than, like, disappear and drop a turret that just sits there and gets beat on.
[98:18.70]No, I'm not.
[98:19.54]I'm not mad.
[98:20.58]Who said I was mad?
[98:25.70]I'm just doing an observation.
[98:31.39]We're observing this.
[98:32.15]I don't like this gun.
[98:32.79]I don't like this gun.
[98:33.57]I don't like this gun.
[98:34.27]I don't like this.
[98:34.81]I don't like any of this.
[98:35.63]I'm not having any fun.
[98:37.77]You know, I'm not having a good time.
[98:39.25]I don't know who this is.
[98:41.23]I'm not sure what voice this is.
[98:43.85]Somebody.
[98:45.04]It could be Jay Leno.
[98:46.92]Maybe.
[98:48.02]But you know, the thing about Jay Leno is he's not really a good Jay Leno.
[98:51.22]This is like Jay Leno if he has his balls crushed.
[98:58.09]I don't think it was like not stopped on Yeah, like a boating accident somebody stepped on a boat How does that happen But it's already like the big you go you like hit like a wave and like you fall down as I click steps on your nuts I Don't know how that happens, but we're gonna go up.
[99:24.68]Oh
[99:26.43]Like the waiter with a big plate of spaghetti.
[99:30.29]You're at the restaurant like, oh Jesus, the fucking wave!
[99:33.35]Stomp!
[99:38.70]He drops the plate of spaghetti in your face too.
[99:41.12]What a disaster that would be.
[99:46.96]That's when we go disappear and we drop one of these babies.
[99:56.26]Is it just me or am I getting rooms this run that are terrible like this one?
[100:01.74]Where everyone instantly pops out of the ground and just take damage.
[100:05.78]Good scrolls are more likely to appear.
[100:07.26]Cool.
[100:10.45]I like that.
[100:11.49]I'll take it.
[100:12.33]Sure.
[100:25.56]You know, that could be the worst enemy in the game.
[100:27.82]I'm gonna die.
[100:30.98]The magician that shoots the thing and teleports around.
[100:34.03]Yep, this is the worst enemy in the game.
[100:38.09]When's the update where they remove that guy?
[100:40.93]I'll give this game a... I'll give... Okay, everybody shut up.
[100:48.46]When's the last time I drank some water?
[100:50.10]Thanks a lot, HoldingMac, you're right.
[100:56.96]Oh, that wasn't acid.
[101:02.99]Fuck.
[101:04.01]Fuck, I ruined it.
[101:04.95]I was gonna say, oh, that wasn't water, that was acid.
[101:07.59]God damn it, rewind it and fucking, here we go.
[101:11.08]No, we're playing the game.
[101:20.62]What?
[101:21.30]These usually blow up in one hit.
[101:22.99]Aye, aye, aye.
[101:28.29]God, fuck on.
[101:30.63]This character sucks.
[101:33.21]Fuck this character.
[101:39.63]I think, you know, this weapon isn't good either.
[101:41.23]None of this, I don't like any of this stuff.
[101:48.39]Those things were dying in one hit last time, and now they're taking like three, two or three hits each.
[102:08.35]Well, that was supposed to hit, but it didn't.
[102:18.15]I'm dead.
[102:19.99]I actually, like, wanted to die, because this character is fucking awful.
[102:23.81]And this run was awful.
[102:26.65]I'm glad I'm dead.
[102:28.07]This was a piece of shit run, and I want to play as this character.
[102:36.35]Oh, yeah, we're turning on integration, too.
[102:45.01]Alright, who am I right now?
[102:47.03]Apis.
[102:49.35]We're doing the Apis upgrade.
[102:50.37]Increase the duration of invincibility and then we're going to do point into ammo.
[102:59.42]And now we're going to go die.
[103:02.22]Because I have to turn it on in the menu.
[103:07.72]Alright guys, ready for a 1, 2, 3 stream?
[103:12.52]It's going to happen after this.
[103:15.57]Actually, can I... Just do it from here and then continue?
[103:23.89]Alright, it's on.
[103:26.82]Switch integration is on.
[103:32.86]Have fun!
[103:33.90]1, 2, 3, stream!
[103:37.81]First floor, double edge, procrastinator, or bullet pack.
[103:41.35]Good luck.
[103:44.11]Thank you for your participation in the livestream, everybody.
[103:47.31]Let's make it a good one.
[103:48.45]Let's make it a real good one.
[103:54.20]I look forward to your votes.
[104:02.40]Now I don't have to worry about them exploding.
[104:04.60]Which, that was such a pain in the ass.
[104:15.92]You know, just turn it on.
[104:17.18]How long does it last now?
[104:22.26]That lasts a very long time.
[104:26.24]Hold on, let me just take care of the worst enemy in the whole game.
[104:29.82]Okay.
[104:35.50]Bullet back.
[104:36.04]I'm not sure what bullet back does.
[104:38.02]Actually, this is going to be a good one.
[104:41.06]I believe bullet back makes it so I... If I land a good shot, I get...
[104:47.27]Money back?
[104:47.79]Or bullets back?
[104:48.99]I get bullets back.
[104:50.31]Yeah.
[104:50.47]That's what I meant.
[104:52.88]I get bullets back.
[105:05.62]One random dude.
[105:11.46]Really?
[105:12.62]You're the one fucking asshole that went the other way.
[105:19.80]All of your friends went one way and you went the other.
[105:22.62]Every two consecutive shots on target recovers one bullet.
[105:25.14]Thanks a lot.
[105:25.92]Thanks a lot, Twitch community.
[105:28.84]You guys rock.
[105:31.56]Thanks for filling me up with nice stuff.
[105:36.41]You snooze, you lose.
[105:37.13]Double A's are empathy.
[105:42.41]Cool.
[105:44.03]Appreciate it.
[105:50.90]Make it happen.
[105:51.48]I don't think I need this right now, but it's okay.
[106:13.28]I wish there was a way that I could...
[106:20.02]I wish there was an item I could eventually... Then there we go.
[106:22.12]We just replaced that with the AK.
[106:26.04]I'm okay with this.
[106:26.70]I wish there was a way I could very easily get to the next room or the boss or something.
[106:35.05]Because I understand it's like a whole progression thing and you keep getting stronger and stronger.
[106:40.11]But sometimes I just kind of want to skip this shit and go right to the boss.
[106:44.48]And I actually am going to replace that.
[106:46.36]I want that.
[106:47.92]That gun is like terrible.
[106:49.56]It really is.
[106:50.06]How do I get up?
[107:03.03]Money.
[107:11.98]Mmm, long stairway.
[107:13.60]Empathy.
[107:14.10]Enemies receive damage when damaging you.
[107:17.30]Thank you.
[107:22.02]You guys are doing real, real good work right now.
[107:24.29]Real solid work, everybody.
[107:35.79]Honestly, I really didn't think that was going to come all the way over and hit me.
[107:44.55]What's left?
[107:46.05]Any more people up?
[107:51.78]Mm-hmm.
[107:56.54]What about you?
[108:00.44]Couple of dinosaurs in this middle room.
[108:02.18]That's fine with me.
[108:06.24]Oh, come on.
[108:11.85]Nooo!
[108:13.63]Whoa, you sprite next to me.
[108:15.67]Not cool.
[108:21.38]Double edge, level 5 vegan, or okay, level 5 vegan, I got to make sure I have.
[108:26.60]Level 5 vegan is, okay, make sure I have this on.
[108:29.60]Because then it's going to be no ammo, no reloads, just spamming and running around in circles.
[108:36.48]So I got to make sure it's on the minigun when that goes through.
[108:39.28]You guys really are helping me out, huh?
[108:46.16]Wow, you guys are doing a lot for me.
[108:50.02]This is going to rock, huh?
[108:56.69]Here it comes.
[108:59.03]Let me get it.
[109:00.11]Level 5 vegan.
[109:00.75]Alright, let's do it.
[109:19.23]Hope you guys are ready for the loud stream, because it's just gonna be like this.
[109:28.30]I hope another weapon doesn't drop.
[109:30.76]Because if it doesn't, we win.
[109:34.58]And we're gonna win the game.
[109:48.62]Keep going.
[109:55.88]This is fucking ridiculous.
[109:57.72]Keep going.
[110:02.70]Speedrun.
[110:03.16]This is our speedrun, right?
[110:16.76]Nothing matters.
[110:17.56]Just kill everything.
[110:23.91]Bad investment, nitro vessel, or plentiful?
[110:26.15]I actually don't even know if I've ever had plentiful.
[110:30.23]I'm not sure what it does.
[110:39.14]We'll find out very soon.
[110:40.44]Let's see what the Jermamites have in store for us.
[110:48.12]I'll go down.
[110:54.26]Yeah.
[110:54.50]I'll go down.
[110:55.30]I'll go that way.
[111:00.07]Is this a TAS?
[111:00.97]A Twitch Assisted Speedrun?
[111:04.47]Creases your attack if you have full health.
[111:06.25]That's very nice.
[111:11.20]That's very good, actually, because I should be able to stay pretty full.
[111:15.08]Especially if I can get in a situation where I can just spam with invincibility on.
[111:20.52]Let's go!
[111:39.89]It's like the enemies are just so spread out.
[111:48.71]I thought I had the double jump!
[111:49.89]I thought I had the double jump.
[111:50.83]Still, I thought I had the fucking double jump still.
[111:52.57]This isn't the last run, you dumbass.
[112:00.76]Oh my god.
[112:01.38]This actually is terrible for this gun.
[112:18.57]I just got fucking hit right in the face.
[112:27.78]Fuck this room.
[112:28.56]This place sucks.
[112:29.48]Get the fuck out of here.
[112:35.95]Platform jumping dog shit.
[112:38.39]If I wanted to platform jump, I would get Super Mario.
[112:53.39]Thanks for spawning right next to me.
[112:54.45]Oh, this game's a 0 out of 10.
[113:03.36]Doubles your crit chance.
[113:04.42]Oh my god, nice.
[113:06.82]Thanks a lot, guys.
[113:10.84]You guys actually are helping the hell out of me right now.
[113:14.54]You guys are doing a great job.
[113:20.58]Cool guy, bullet back, again, or novice.
[113:22.78]We already have bullet back, don't we?
[113:40.42]Just like fucking hammering, hammering down.
[113:43.68]There's no rhyme or reason to any of this.
[113:48.59]I'm just kind of existing and holding the button down.
[113:51.47]Is somebody going to figure out the name of that character so I can make the joke once and for all and get over it?
[114:05.06]Reach the chest.
[114:13.49]Ow.
[114:14.85]Hey, I reached it.
[114:16.97]I don't know what that is.
[114:18.95]But I'm not... Oh, no!
[114:26.27]God damn it.
[114:27.23]What is this?
[114:27.73]I mean, why am I trying to aim down sights with it?
[114:34.29]I very clearly grabbed that edge.
[114:36.30]Very, like, very clearly.
[114:41.44]What a cool guy.
[114:42.36]This weapon's weird.
[114:53.05]Oh, it's a freeze ray.
[114:54.19]No friendly fire.
[114:55.13]Cool.
[114:56.95]Why would you equip it?
[114:57.58]It don't matter.
[114:58.94]If a weapon drops, then I lose that buff.
[115:03.46]I had the same conversation the other day.
[115:05.04]I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[115:06.62]What happened?
[115:08.22]If any weapon drops, then I lose the effect.
[115:17.69]Love is blind?
[115:18.33]New beginning or bad investment?
[115:25.82]See what Twitter chat is going to do.
[115:38.63]What is Twitter chat going to do?
[115:40.25]Let's see.
[115:44.45]Well, we can pick this up.
[115:48.77]Alright.
[115:49.47]I'm okay with that.
[115:51.95]Love is blind.
[115:52.41]New beginning.
[115:52.93]New beginning deletes everything, right?
[115:54.10]Okay.
[115:56.81]Wait, no, don't make me go to the very... This is a room full of spikes, by the way.
[116:07.22]I don't like this spike room at all.
[116:17.03]Will they activate the spikes too and die or no?
[116:20.89]I wonder.
[116:29.05]I mean, I hear the ribbits, but I don't see the ribbits.
[116:30.97]You know?
[116:36.79]I hear the ribbits.
[116:38.97]Oh, there are the ribbits.
[116:44.69]You can't see your health bar.
[116:48.10]You guys kind of got me.
[116:50.66]But, my gosh, that's great.
[116:52.20]Whatever.
[116:52.58]I mean, that sucks.
[116:54.54]That sucks.
[116:57.42]But just don't get hit.
[116:58.82]That's all I need to know.
[117:01.08]Just don't get hit.
[117:02.76]Everything will be fine.
[117:12.47]Oh, please.
[117:13.01]Just move.
[117:13.71]You idiot.
[117:16.05]You fucking idiot.
[117:19.87]The other two were worse.
[117:21.07]Yeah, that's true.
[117:22.49]Chest.
[117:24.20]Chest.
[117:26.08]Couple of chests.
[117:27.23]More than one chest.
[117:29.59]More than three chests.
[117:31.09]Two chests.
[117:35.37]And... Another gun.
[117:38.89]And this is just a straight up shotgun.
[117:40.43]Nice.
[117:41.39]I like.
[117:44.66]Thank god.
[117:50.92]I don't like how close you have to get with this, but at the same time...
[117:55.29]It's very powerful.
[118:02.40]I'm shocked I didn't get hit by any of that, actually.
[118:10.36]And goodbye.
[118:12.98]Alright.
[118:15.36]Picking the boring ones.
[118:16.54]They're not that boring.
[118:21.36]Third floor, let's get there.
[118:23.02]Let's do it.
[118:24.22]Let's get out of here.
[118:25.60]Let's scoop it.
[118:27.74]Let's scoop it up.
[118:36.63]That one or that one?
[118:40.17]Let's go with that one.
[118:42.81]Thanks for the accuracy, Twitch community.
[118:44.79]You guys are so cool.
[118:52.67]You guys give me life.
[118:55.64]Appreciate it.
[118:56.16]Thank you.
[119:03.04]Four hits.
[119:03.90]That's not cool.
[119:09.16]Really?
[119:18.72]You take too much damage.
[119:19.64]Alright, give me the damage one.
[119:22.44]When the next damage one pops up, I want my Twitch community to give me damage.
[119:30.28]Reload this, and then shotgun blast that clock person.
[119:34.08]That works.
[119:44.36]Speed it up.
[119:46.94]Wall Street Wolf, Damn Who, and Slowpoke.
[119:51.18]I wonder what I have in store.
[119:52.94]Wall Street Wolf, I believe.
[119:54.12]Yeah, I think it is damage.
[119:55.62]Now I gotta go up.
[120:01.98]Chest.
[120:03.14]Ooh, okay, good.
[120:05.26]Give me cool stuff.
[120:08.78]Lots of money.
[120:11.04]That works for me.
[120:11.92]What about more money?
[120:16.08]Nice.
[120:18.18]I'm happy.
[120:19.08]I'm happy with this.
[120:26.51]Let's take a left.
[120:31.91]Hmm.
[120:33.50]Doubles your money, but you lose 75% of your current health.
[120:39.40]You guys... What the fuck?
[120:44.50]That's not what I wanted.
[120:45.48]This is not what I wanted.
[120:47.54]I wanted damage.
[120:51.15]You guys gave me fucking... I'm, like, gonna die.
[120:59.27]You've killed me.
[121:02.07]I mean, like... Twitch community.
[121:06.47]You've killed me.
[121:08.45]Why am I saying Twitch community?
[121:09.83]Like, that's so lame.
[121:10.77]I'm done saying that.
[121:12.05]If I ever say that again... Throw a rock at me.
[121:25.34]I'm dead.
[121:26.42]I died.
[121:27.76]I didn't even know how much health I had.
[121:29.12]I liked it.
[121:32.13]You've killed me.
[121:32.83]I told you guys.
[121:34.55]You've killed me.
[121:41.99]You've killed me.
[121:47.90]Died before we could shit.
[121:49.10]8,000 gold.
[121:49.92]Yeah, that's true.
[121:52.30]What is... Whoa.
[121:53.86]It's like a burst shot.
[121:55.84]What is her... She shoots out a falcon?
[122:06.87]What is that dumb thing?
[122:08.15]What is this?
[122:08.55]Sniper rifle?
[122:15.65]Alright, let's go to Neith.
[122:17.81]Falcon will attack the nearest enemy and pass a bonus damage over long distances.
[122:21.19]That's kind of cool.
[122:23.20]But... Do I not have a character yet?
[122:28.52]I think I have everybody now.
[122:30.00]Extra jump.
[122:31.24]Oh.
[122:33.36]Oh, I want that.
[122:37.08]I will take the extra jump.
[122:38.14]That's very important.
[122:39.06]Now it's just there permanently.
[122:43.80]More gold.
[122:44.48]I need... Oh, God.
[122:49.39]This is going to take a while to get this guy.
[122:53.08]Speed upgrade increases base speed.
[122:54.94]I need six.
[122:55.98]Let's do that.
[122:58.76]Ah, that's so much money.
[123:00.24]I'm doing it once.
[123:01.92]Wow.
[123:03.24]Okay.
[123:03.90]A new character.
[123:05.38]Amit.
[123:09.29]Obtain Amit's favor.
[123:10.09]Sacrifices your maximum life in order to increase the amount of life you recover passively.
[123:15.05]You recover life every time you kill an enemy, but meat no longer... Okay, so... That's weird.
[123:29.52]I kind of, like, don't give a shit about that at all.
[123:31.00]Okay.
[123:38.01]Okay.
[123:41.29]Let's get a scroll here.
[123:42.43]No, I don't.
[123:43.27]I can't afford it.
[123:45.49]Well, okay.
[123:46.39]I'm losing $372.
[123:47.15]Alright.
[123:54.08]What's her passive again?
[123:56.14]I completely forgot.
[123:57.00]It's just the eagle and then... Somebody will tell me.
[124:01.00]Sorry.
[124:05.51]One of you guys will tell me.
[124:08.79]Oh, the fucking medallions.
[124:10.07]You're right.
[124:12.20]No, just kill me.
[124:17.97]I want to see what they are.
[124:18.71]Alright.
[124:26.66]Never mind.
[124:27.02]Never mind.
[124:30.00]Let's go.
[124:30.34]Never mind.
[124:45.98]I don't like this character already.
[124:49.41]I can promise you that.
[124:53.03]No, I don't like it.
[124:53.63]I don't like Neith.
[124:57.41]Nope.
[124:58.35]No, sir, I don't like it.
[125:04.64]Wet floor.
[125:05.20]You're already going to do this to me?
[125:12.96]At least I have a permanent double jump.
[125:18.62]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[125:19.98]House.
[125:22.53]Boss Slayer.
[125:23.19]Give me the Boss Slayer.
[125:26.69]Like, come on.
[125:27.23]Give me Boss Slayer, dudes.
[125:29.01]Come on, I'm calling you my, like, dudes.
[125:30.51]I'm calling you my community.
[125:31.99]A lot of recoil on this one.
[125:50.68]Nothing?
[125:52.93]Alright, well, I guess it's just a chest.
[125:55.23]That works for me.
[125:55.91]That chest was pretty terrible, but whatever.
[126:10.24]People are so easily swayed by dude.
[126:15.58]Bosses have less health.
[126:17.00]Nice.
[126:18.89]Thank you, you Jermaniacs.
[126:22.11]Thank you, you Jermamites.
[126:26.97]Thank you, you Germanys.
[126:35.33]What a vote swayer.
[126:42.17]See, this is where Neith will be, like, good.
[126:45.07]But only for, like, rooms like this.
[126:50.22]I mean, is this a homing missile?
[126:52.18]I guess it is.
[126:55.74]She ain't bad.
[126:57.60]She's okay.
[127:00.72]I kind of hate her, though, still.
[127:12.53]I still don't really think I like this character.
[127:17.09]Still interesting.
[127:19.29]I'm okay with it.
[127:20.45]It's okay.
[127:22.45]Nobody has to lose their mind over this.
[127:24.97]Everything's gonna be fine.
[127:37.42]Which is why I don't like this character.
[127:39.36]It's too stressful to aim down a tunnel vision when there's this many spawning points.
[127:51.50]What?
[128:00.58]The machine gun's pretty good, though.
[128:03.32]I will say the machine gun is good.
[128:06.14]Thanks for the defense.
[128:09.24]FPF streamer, hey.
[128:10.38]Wait, who said I was an FPS streamer?
[128:16.46]I'm not an FPS streamer.
[128:20.99]I'm a chill zone streamer.
[128:34.23]Wall ray vision.
[128:36.35]Nice.
[128:39.14]I'm alright with all these picks, guys.
[128:40.74]These are pretty good picks.
[128:44.42]Really?
[128:46.58]Where did...
[128:54.73]I was going to say, where the hell did everybody go?
[128:57.27]Now that's a lot of money that I'm not going to get.
[128:58.95]I might get there in time.
[129:05.14]Yeah, I will.
[129:12.63]I'll get there in time.
[129:13.57]I can't wait for this x-ray vision.
[129:22.66]Giving him good scrolls, ResidentSleeper.
[129:27.68]I gotta get to the last boss again.
[129:29.82]I got there once and had a fucking meltdown.
[129:32.74]Is that an instant kill, no matter who it touches?
[129:49.43]I feel like it is, and this is not good.
[129:55.40]Too much recoil on this.
[129:58.56]We have to get him far and then ruin his run.
[130:02.67]I guess that is the theory, huh?
[130:05.41]Get me to the last boss and then give me, like, the restart the game scroll.
[130:10.95]I guess that would work.
[130:15.88]Where's the... Where's...
[130:25.17]Hey, Gunhaven, thanks.
[130:27.08]Gunhaver, thank you.
[130:28.14]They said, good stream.
[130:30.18]Sir, thank you.
[130:31.14]Thank you for the bits.
[130:36.08]Compass.
[130:38.40]Please let this run be the run.
[130:40.16]The run to end all runs.
[130:41.30]Give me the compass.
[130:41.96]That tells me exactly where the fuck I need to go.
[130:44.42]And give me damage, too, because these fat guys don't die in one hit.
[130:47.06]That needs to change, Twitch community.
[130:58.92]This room is very, very large.
[131:06.50]Big room.
[131:08.46]For a big boy.
[131:23.39]You guys are unanimously voting for this, too.
[131:26.19]You know, I appreciate that.
[131:30.91]I appreciate... Wait, wait, wait.
[131:32.84]Weren't you guys supposed to throw rocks at me if I said the Twitch community thing again?
[131:35.94]I think you were.
[131:54.95]Reveals special rooms, though.
[131:58.07]Doesn't tell me exactly where to go.
[131:59.63]Just reveals, like, the cool rooms.
[132:02.11]Oh, no, it doesn't.
[132:02.93]It tells me exactly where I need to go.
[132:04.43]Perfect.
[132:04.91]Alright, this is the run.
[132:07.41]What was that noise?
[132:08.43]Oh, it's just pots.
[132:11.37]It was just pots.
[132:12.12]Don't worry.
[132:12.58]I'm okay.
[132:20.94]I don't need the chest because I have Twitch.
[132:23.62]I was going to say the C word.
[132:26.62]I was going to say the community word.
[132:27.80]There we go.
[132:30.18]Straight up here.
[132:32.98]Where?
[132:35.38]Over there.
[132:38.31]Perfect.
[132:38.63]Die.
[132:45.73]Die.
[132:58.34]Right when I turn around, you get me right in the lip.
[133:02.49]I don't want any lip from you, dude.
[133:05.83]Especially you, clock man.
[133:10.49]The air is lava.
[133:13.83]You're not actually going to make the air hurt me.
[133:18.72]We're going to let this... I'm not going to influence the election.
[133:22.34]We're going to let this play out.
[133:26.06]No, we're going this way.
[133:29.48]Yeah.
[133:30.54]This way, yeah.
[133:32.76]I'm not going to influence this election at all.
[133:47.62]Damn, this room sucks.
[133:48.76]This room is fucking awful.
[133:50.16]So much spam.
[133:59.87]Every two consecutive shots, targets... You know what it does.
[134:07.41]You all know what it does.
[134:08.17]God damn it.
[134:18.58]Too long of a reload on this thing, too.
[134:20.06]Reload, and we're taking a right.
[134:30.44]Right to the boss.
[134:31.12]Let's kill this boss.
[134:34.77]Make sure we're all loaded up.
[134:36.61]And boink.
[134:37.53]Perfect.
[134:38.75]Speedrun.
[134:45.57]I like it.
[134:46.72]Only one burst gets rid of each sarcophagi.
[134:49.04]And then we're pulling out the sniper rifle and this dude is dead.
[135:02.28]And here comes the Phoenix and Sniper Rifle.
[135:04.76]Okay, well, like, that was dumb.
[135:11.64]Because, like, he didn't have the fucking... You know, we're gonna do the other gun.
[135:14.67]Because, like, that was fucking dumb.
[135:17.77]Like, he wasn't glowing.
[135:21.61]I'm so angry at how fucking stupid that was.
[135:24.03]That, like, I hate this game right now.
[135:30.41]I'm furious that that didn't fucking work.
[135:34.16]It was fucking stupid.
[135:36.98]Let's go.
[135:44.06]New weapon.
[135:47.93]Long range, right?
[135:52.33]Gravity like Mars.
[135:58.35]It means I can jump higher.
[136:01.66]Do I get rid of this terrible gun?
[136:04.04]This one's good.
[136:08.35]Sniper rifle is good.
[136:09.23]It's important.
[136:09.77]I need to keep it.
[136:11.03]But I do want a rocket launcher.
[136:12.15]So we're going to replace this.
[136:17.33]Let's go.
[136:20.91]Disease, blood offering, or lucky shot?
[136:25.27]Cool.
[136:25.41]Where are we going?
[136:28.71]That's a long way to go.
[136:32.95]Holy shit, that's actually very far.
[136:34.89]A bunch of frogs.
[136:43.62]Just chill right here.
[136:44.60]I'm glad I can see everybody through the walls, otherwise this would be very awkward.
[137:17.21]There's meat over here too.
[137:18.21]Alright, now we're back in business.
[137:20.67]I had to be quiet there.
[137:22.33]That was kind of ridiculous.
[137:24.15]That was hard.
[137:25.47]Dude, that was hard.
[137:27.25]Alright, where are we going?
[137:35.33]Just have to go up.
[137:39.03]Up or left or right or just up.
[137:44.42]Probably take this there.
[137:45.10]Yeah, there we go.
[137:52.24]That was, that was dumb.
[137:54.46]Did you see that?
[137:55.06]That was fucking dumb.
[137:57.90]Decrease enemy health.
[137:59.02]You guys are giving me such a ridiculous run here.
[138:02.54]If I don't do something with this, then I may as well just hand it in.
[138:05.83]May as well just hand in the gamer card.
[138:12.85]I just got blown to fucking hell.
[138:27.49]Neitz active is bad.
[138:33.14]I don't want to say worthless, but that's the word that's trying to sit on my mouth right now and come out of my mouth.
[138:37.20]I don't know how accurate that is.
[138:40.36]It's accurate in my reality.
[138:51.46]Like... Is this fucking asshole still alive after all this... Oh, recoil.
[138:56.34]Remember that game?
[138:57.78]Remember Recoil?
[138:58.78]What happened to that game?
[139:00.42]Did it fail?
[139:00.86]Okay, I need to reload the rocket launcher.
[139:15.39]Turn around and go this way.
[139:17.83]This is a rocket launcher room.
[139:33.99]One more.
[139:43.42]Thanks.
[139:45.40]Speed run, huh?
[139:46.18]Give me that speed.
[139:48.34]Jumping grants you a temporary speed boost.
[139:53.94]This is a fun run.
[139:58.09]Although the weapons, I think, could be more to be desired.
[140:01.05]Speaking of weapons...
[140:03.33]What the hell is this?
[140:04.29]An Uzi or something?
[140:07.91]Yeah.
[140:09.07]This is the same gun with no recoil.
[140:11.81]Thank you.
[140:12.53]I'll take it.
[140:14.91]Yeah, I'll take it.
[140:15.43]Mm-hmm.
[140:30.15]Yep.
[140:37.72]The bird sucks!
[140:47.31]The bird just flies around in random directions and it hits somebody and goes... You play Neath for the passive, it seems.
[141:06.09]Let me breathe.
[141:10.42]What does that one do?
[141:13.04]I don't remember.
[141:19.12]Vote 1 for trolling?
[141:23.75]Don't do that.
[141:24.29]That's not nice.
[141:25.49]But I can only tell you what I think.
[141:28.89]You are your own group of Twitch shatters.
[141:32.11]You can do whatever you want to me.
[141:35.13]In the game, that is.
[141:44.57]Sounds about right.
[141:48.88]After receiving damage, you become momentarily invincible.
[141:55.20]Vote one, vote one.
[141:56.38]When did I say vote one?
[141:57.52]I just said do whatever you want.
[141:58.94]It's your guy's choice.
[142:00.30]Viewer's choice right now.
[142:06.80]But just make sure you pick the one that's just like triple meat.
[142:10.12]Make sure you go to the drive-thru at Wendy's and ask for like a quadruple cheeseburger.
[142:14.43]And have them go, holy shit, you really want that?
[142:17.08]And you go, yeah, motherfucker.
[142:18.32]That's why I ordered it at the window.
[142:19.50]You think I'm joking?
[142:22.24]I thought you were joking.
[142:23.08]There's a chest here.
[142:26.88]I might as well just get it.
[142:31.19]Fuck.
[142:39.33]Lots of money.
[142:42.71]Very nice.
[142:48.13]Is there one more in here?
[142:48.93]I think there's usually one up top too, right?
[142:52.13]Have I lost my mind?
[142:53.03]I have lost my mind.
[143:06.89]Hmm, weird spot.
[143:11.86]Like, weird spot, but, like, where the fuck... Oh, that's... That is, like, gonna give me... That is gonna give me a massive issue.
[143:20.41]Why did that guy have to just be right fucking next to me for no reason?
[143:23.31]Are you trying to make me angry?
[143:34.80]Is this when every time I crit, I get money?
[143:36.52]Is that what you guys are about to give me?
[143:39.34]Critical hits release a gold coin.
[143:44.39]I love Twitch plays Jerma's emotions.
[143:47.63]This is pretty fun.
[143:52.81]Twitch plays my emotions.
[143:56.02]Twitch gives Jerma emotional breakdown.
[143:58.86]Thought that guy was dead.
[144:11.64]But he's not!
[144:13.78]That guy can aim up?
[144:16.34]Since when have they been able to aim up?
[144:18.53]They can't have, like, sentience right now.
[144:27.23]I actually do have to be careful here, because I'm getting close to the boss.
[144:33.71]Alright, I'm gonna fucking around.
[144:34.65]Like, get, like, full health.
[144:54.40]Guess I'll vote for a good scroll again.
[144:56.46]You don't have to do that if you don't want to.
[145:01.77]This room is nightmarish.
[145:14.19]Do you see how fucking minuscule that was for me to hit the tiny pole?
[145:19.15]I hit the lamp post.
[145:23.19]How do you hit a lamp post like that?
[145:25.19]You just don't.
[145:25.73]I didn't just take damage from that, did I?
[145:48.58]No.
[145:48.96]Reloads.
[145:50.48]And we'll get back to it.
[145:55.11]Meat?
[145:55.39]No meat.
[145:56.11]When do you guys have to have meat?
[146:00.40]Vessels on our ex- What have you done?
[146:07.02]Why?
[146:07.52]That's not cool.
[146:09.22]I'm going to accidentally die now.
[146:11.28]This is such a perfect run.
[146:14.21]This was turning into so beautiful of a run.
[146:16.91]And now I'm going to instantly die when I walk into the next room.
[146:25.20]Thought I could trust you guys.
[146:26.78]That's so fucking terrible.
[146:31.06]I'm gonna forget that shit, guys, and it's gonna kill me.
[146:35.65]Weak bullets.
[146:36.27]Don't vote for weak bullets.
[146:39.33]Don't do that.
[146:44.24]And fuck me.
[146:45.56]Because now I'm, like, freaking out.
[146:47.12]I just lost, like, four meats.
[146:55.65]God damn it.
[146:56.59]This is bad You heard the man no give me God give me God mode.
[147:09.38]Yeah vote to vote for God mode I'm going up here.
[147:14.82]We need to get to the boss as fast as possible This is so awful
[147:28.89]I'm just kidding.
[147:29.29]Oh, fuck these enemies.
[147:31.07]Delete these from the game and replace them with anything else.
[147:33.13]I don't care what you replace it with.
[147:34.22]Replace it with anything.
[147:37.80]These enemies are not fun.
[147:41.48]They're just frustrating.
[147:42.54]I swear to God, I'm going to fucking scream at these enemies.
[147:50.15]Those things are stupid.
[147:51.77]They're not fun.
[147:52.61]They're bad.
[147:53.13]Those are bad.
[147:56.45]And I just ran into a fucking pot.
[148:02.55]Give me a ton of meat.
[148:05.23]And that's a better version of this gun.
[148:11.31]Just fill me up.
[148:14.99]Thank you.
[148:15.43]I'm going right.
[148:19.94]This is the boss.
[148:22.18]Not right this second, but hopefully there's no pots at the boss.
[148:25.26]Otherwise we're going to be in trouble.
[148:33.11]Weapons of your god have an attack bonus.
[148:34.97]Oh.
[148:36.85]I guess that's alright.
[148:44.16]There's nowhere for me to do it.
[148:45.56]This room is like... You guys know what I'm trying to say right now.
[148:50.98]It's pretty much all I need to say is not cool.
[148:55.10]Stupid fucking... Ugh.
[149:06.37]I can't run fast.
[149:08.49]Because I can't touch any pots.
[149:10.83]So we're going to take this very slowly.
[149:20.56]Drop a bunch of meat.
[149:21.82]These things always drop meat.
[149:24.78]Give me the full health.
[149:32.94]No meat at all.
[149:35.86]No meat at all.
[149:38.28]How?
[149:41.46]Just money.
[149:42.06]Who needs money?
[149:50.51]Well, I have to fight this boss at half health.
[149:52.89]Alright, so, you guys are telling me that this boss, if I shoot, I shoot the green shit underneath him, and he's gonna die.
[150:04.56]Not even the boss.
[150:05.08]I'm not even there yet.
[150:13.42]Jesus.
[150:15.66]Oh.
[150:16.02]My.
[150:16.50]God.
[150:26.70]What is this?
[150:28.50]A pod or something?
[150:29.34]Oh, those are like the grenades.
[150:31.12]I don't want those.
[150:31.70]I do not want the grenade things.
[150:35.30]Not right now, at least.
[150:36.97]This is a good setup.
[150:38.29]I have my splash damage, I have my long range, and I have my medium range.
[150:41.91]I'm good.
[150:52.14]Chris, you're attacking at full health.
[150:53.20]Well, I'm not going to have full health, Phil.
[150:54.76]But thank you.
[150:58.63]Thank you for your at least attempt to make this work.
[151:04.86]I do appreciate it.
[151:05.62]Alright, let's go fight the boss.
[151:18.72]Alright, seventh floor.
[151:19.80]We got our stuff here.
[151:23.38]Full health.
[151:24.26]Fantastic.
[151:26.30]And full ammo.
[151:27.40]And let's make sure everything has full ammo.
[151:32.13]Let's go fight Mr. Bossman.
[151:35.37]Here we go.
[151:38.33]Shoot the blue shit underneath him.
[151:40.68]You know what I was trying to say.
[151:57.63]Oh, fuck.
[151:59.81]Actually, I can jump over it.
[152:06.18]This guy's so easy.
[152:07.24]I didn't know he was this easy.
[152:09.64]I would have been mildly upset by this.
[152:14.65]Look at how easy this is.
[152:17.19]Oh my god, he's not easy.
[152:18.93]Now he's got like an old school toys worth of... Double jump!
[152:51.05]Oh, ring-a-ding-ding.
[152:52.40]Ring-a-ding-ding.
[152:53.44]Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
[152:55.44]Ring-a-ding-ding.
[152:58.20]Oh, yeah.
[152:58.66]What's that called?
[152:59.26]That's called a fucking ring-a-ding-ding.
[153:01.10]Ring-a-ding-ding.
[153:02.38]How much money is that?
[153:03.12]What is this?
[153:05.10]What's that song that goes ring-a-ding-dong?
[153:08.47]Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong.
[153:12.53]Got it.
[153:18.38]Oh shit, you guys almost just reset the floor.
[153:24.74]That was fucking close.
[153:31.06]That was actually really close.
[153:35.37]Oh lord, okay.
[153:36.89]Let's try this person.
[153:41.65]So I beat this, but one of the other pyramids open up now, right?
[153:46.85]Nice.
[153:52.02]Okay.
[153:53.46]Get 7,000.
[153:54.66]New pyramid.
[154:01.25]Let's go with some more health.
[154:06.23]Some more attack.
[154:08.56]Some more crit chance.
[154:15.40]More health.
[154:16.38]More health.
[154:18.64]Ah.
[154:19.78]More defense.
[154:21.22]Okay.
[154:22.45]What else you got for me?
[154:23.33]Medallions.
[154:24.51]Grease attack and defense.
[154:26.15]Health, ammo, and gold pickups are better, but don't last as long.
[154:31.59]Hmm.
[154:32.91]You start the first period right after the battle with the pharaoh.
[154:36.00]That would have been handy.
[154:38.26]I'm going to try this one.
[154:41.08]Let's try it.
[154:43.30]Health, ammo, and gold pickups are better, but they don't last as long.
[154:48.60]Sure.
[154:48.76]Let's try the new pyramid.
[154:50.68]Uh, this is a new character I've never played before.
[154:53.88]The right click hurts you.
[154:55.34]Let me just look at this again.
[155:00.05]Uh, where is this stupid, awful character that I'm going to despise?
[155:06.90]Sacrifices your maximum life in order to increase the amount of life you recover passively.
[155:19.58]Okay.
[155:21.70]So this is dangerous.
[155:26.88]What is this?
[155:27.22]Treasure chests?
[155:31.37]You open up your bat box.
[155:34.09]This character sucks.
[155:42.22]It resets when you go into the dungeon, guys.
[155:44.24]Don't worry.
[155:45.70]Everything resets.
[155:49.10]I'm gonna have the, like, 190, whatever health.
[155:51.28]Everything resets.
[155:56.32]I thought everything resets.
[156:01.75]Hey, have I shown you my bats yet?
[156:03.31]Take a look!
[156:04.73]Wow!
[156:05.61]Look at all these bats in here!
[156:08.09]New meta!
[156:15.43]I don't like that character.
[156:16.31]I'm not playing it.
[156:26.95]I like Appas.
[156:30.81]Wasted votes.
[156:33.71]It's not wasted votes.
[156:37.43]Are these activated still?
[156:38.97]Yeah.
[156:39.93]Activate that shit.
[156:41.27]Alright, let's go fight Georgie, or whatever his name is in here.
[156:50.53]Watch, just like in Ghostbusters 2, I'm gonna be Rick Moranis, and there's a ton of shit going on inside.
[156:55.01]There's a huge fight going on inside, and I'm outside, and everyone, like, the whole, all of New York City is watching me right now.
[157:01.78]And here we go, like, I'm gonna die.
[157:03.02]I'm gonna do it, guys!
[157:03.84]Oh, and then, like, the fucking pyramid comes down, and, like, the bad guy in there dies.
[157:10.82]And everyone's like, holy shit, Rick Moranis, you just fucking won!
[157:14.34]And I'm like, yeah.
[157:21.74]Hey, Dr. Pig.
[157:22.82]Dr. Pig, thanks for the $5.
[157:23.60]They say college is finally over, but I just learned that I no longer have a job.
[157:30.95]This is going to be the last bits for a while.
[157:33.75]I have to do it one more time for the meme.
[157:36.20]Happy fake real birthday, Cody sucks.
[157:38.92]I love you, meme, meme.
[157:40.50]Well, Dr. Pig.
[157:42.37]I wish you luck.
[157:43.45]Don't worry.
[157:44.69]You've given me money.
[157:46.07]You've given me money.
[157:48.82]I've seen your name pop up a lot of times.
[157:51.32]Don't worry about that.
[157:53.94]Don't worry about giving the stream money.
[157:57.70]Don't ever think that that's a necessity.
[158:00.94]But let's play the video game.
[158:05.97]New characters.
[158:07.19]New monsters.
[158:09.85]We got new monsters, boys and girls.
[158:17.05]they take these guys actually are kind of hard these guys have a lot of health a lot of calories you know what I mean a lot of calories damn guys like is the money the same or is the am I getting more money per coin
[158:50.48]The air is lava is going to win.
[158:52.30]Guys, this is the first floor.
[158:54.00]You know I can just walk into something and die and start it over, right?
[158:59.27]I mean, you know, that's not that hard.
[159:07.87]Literally just press escape and do it again.
[159:10.27]Oh, wow.
[159:10.99]Jumping in the air will hurt you on the first floor.
[159:13.38]In the first room.
[159:15.22]Oh, no.
[159:16.00]What the fuck am I going to do?
[159:26.50]Yes, you would be a coward.
[159:27.76]I'm just kidding.
[159:28.74]I'm not going to do that.
[159:39.35]I don't like this enemies have more health thing, though.
[159:44.77]I lost my... That's too bad.
[159:47.35]Oh, well.
[159:51.04]Oh, well.
[159:51.72]Whoa!
[159:52.54]What?
[159:55.19]Where did you come from?
[159:56.41]Okay, I just killed that guy and his brain came out.
[159:59.51]That guy's brain is now an enemy.
[160:03.69]That dude was spinning and his brain comes out and rolls around.
[160:06.25]Holy shit, what an insane enemy.
[160:09.58]Watch this.
[160:10.08]The dude's fucking brain's gonna pop out.
[160:12.80]Why did his brain didn't come out that time?
[160:19.20]You can't fucking... Like, dumbass like Lucario.
[160:24.56]So glad you're not in the new Smash Brothers.
[160:30.50]Whoa.
[160:37.04]Oh, another game just got harder.
[160:38.20]The game got harder.
[160:40.75]We don't want hard games.
[160:41.61]We want easy, fun games.
[160:43.67]We don't want to fuck with the turkeys.
[160:53.65]What's going on in the chat right now?
[160:55.11]It's all like the Kappas and shit.
[160:56.41]What happened?
[160:58.71]Tranquilizer gun.
[160:59.53]No, let's keep this.
[161:00.85]What's going on?
[161:01.67]Why are we in emote only?
[161:02.90]What happened?
[161:04.76]You can't remain still.
[161:06.02]This is like a shit run already.
[161:09.40]I can't stand still.
[161:11.78]And I can't double jump.
[161:14.98]So... You guys have made this a dog shit run already.
[161:36.70]Honestly, I'm just gonna die here.
[161:46.01]The enemies are cool, though.
[161:47.69]We'll give them that.
[161:48.35]I need to tranquilize this guy.
[161:52.52]He's freaking me out.
[162:07.30]What's left?
[162:08.66]Another person here?
[162:09.76]One of these little bugs?
[162:10.62]There we go.
[162:16.24]Finish his game with character he hates.
[162:17.86]Instant shit run with character he likes.
[162:20.86]Yeah, that's usually pretty much how it runs down here.
[162:23.10]I just double jumped.
[162:26.66]Ow.
[162:29.42]I like these new rooms.
[162:30.29]These are really cool.
[162:36.58]So many new enemy types.
[162:37.90]This is crazy.
[162:38.66]Are these spikes on the ground, too?
[162:43.98]What on the fuck?
[162:45.17]Holy shit, the game's difficulty just ramped up by, like, times five.
[162:48.53]Alright, well, thanks for deleting those scrolls.
[163:07.92]This is just like in that Super Mario 64 level where you climb up the... Where you get the blue switch.
[163:14.50]Remember that blue switch level in Mario?
[163:17.73]Just like that.
[163:30.96]That guy just posed for that picture.
[163:32.32]Thanks, dude.
[163:41.33]Alright, thankfully I don't have to go back over there.
[164:03.85]Can this guy not double jump?
[164:08.31]Why can I not double jump with this person?
[164:10.02]Is that only with... Oh, that's only with that one character, I think, right?
[164:21.32]Click.
[164:24.78]What?
[164:26.04]They usually break.
[164:27.74]The egg breaks.
[164:28.48]When you break an egg, the yolk doesn't still live.
[164:30.48]It breaks apart.
[164:49.11]I like that.
[164:49.73]For each critical hit, you recover one bullet.
[164:51.77]Crit ammo.
[164:52.13]Well, that ain't going to last very long, so... Thanks, though.
[164:57.80]Thanks for the interesting thing you gave me.
[165:14.17]This room had nothing in it.
[165:16.70]It was so huge and it was so difficult and there was nothing even here.
[165:21.65]How annoying.
[165:23.17]All the way to the right.
[165:24.39]Or all the way to the left.
[165:25.21]Let's go left.
[165:29.41]Refill Lucky Luke or Pacifism?
[165:33.89]I don't know.
[165:37.61]I don't know, right?
[165:38.31]Great.
[165:41.94]Come on before he gets here.
[165:58.10]I killed three consecutive stupid snakes.
[166:01.02]I was trying to get them all.
[166:02.28]Whoa.
[166:03.35]Alright, you're new.
[166:03.95]I need to see what you do.
[166:09.67]I'm gonna make another Mario reference.
[166:13.18]That's the wizard from Mario, Super Mario World.
[166:17.13]You know the one that goes like... And it's like triangles and shit and geometry.
[166:23.09]What's that guy's name?
[166:24.97]That was just him.
[166:25.71]There he is.
[166:26.89]See?
[166:29.71]He's even shooting triangles.
[166:30.91]I'm about to die.
[166:43.65]Oh.
[166:44.49]Thanks, guys.
[166:47.88]Alright, you get to... Thank you.
[166:51.83]You get to live another day.
[166:53.69]And by another day, I mean like five seconds.
[167:02.60]I really need more damage.
[167:04.22]I'm going to have to upgrade damage for the next two or three upgrades.
[167:16.91]Why do I feel like that medallion didn't do very much?
[167:19.79]I guess I feel that way too.
[167:30.85]I don't like this room.
[167:32.24]This room is too wavy and shaky.
[167:33.76]I want to go to the other one.
[167:39.50]Okay.
[167:39.98]Wrong way.
[167:41.38]It's up in there.
[167:47.17]Don't get hurt.
[167:47.67]Alright, which way looks easier?
[167:51.09]I guess I have to go this way.
[167:54.45]No double jump, don't get hurt.
[168:00.00]Um...
[168:19.95]That was impossible with this character, it just was.
[168:21.99]I can't double jump with this fucking guy.
[168:33.59]No crosshairs.
[168:39.11]Shit.
[168:40.91]That is no scope, people.
[168:46.19]This is so bad.
[168:48.39]Well, we don't need to aim with this, do we?
[168:55.29]Just need to shoot that in random directions.
[168:57.42]Don't need to aim that.
[168:58.26]Fuck.
[169:18.63]Well, this actually really sucks.
[169:23.67]I think we're almost at the first mini-boss, right?
[169:25.75]I think.
[169:27.51]Something like that.
[169:32.51]Second floor.
[169:33.13]We got one more floor.
[169:35.34]I wonder if we can get there.
[169:39.04]New landscape.
[169:40.14]Cool.
[169:41.84]This is much bigger.
[169:45.54]I feel like I'm not getting more money.
[169:50.58]You would think that that would scale up significantly at this point, because everything is like a thousand gold to upgrade once at this point.
[169:58.33]Like, I kind of feel like it's not scaling.
[170:02.71]Fuck you.
[170:16.76]If I have Razor Death Adder, I'm currently using that, gamers.
[170:22.60]That's what I currently use.
[170:26.83]You're looking for the best.
[170:31.15]The best mouse you could possibly buy.
[170:34.91]No, that's not true.
[170:38.98]You know, I would say that if there was another button.
[170:44.82]Razer DeathAdder has a middle mouse button and two thumb buttons.
[170:48.76]You get one more thumb button down there, like down maybe like a quarter of an inch below these two.
[170:54.25]It's the best mouse ever made.
[170:57.45]They don't have that.
[170:58.43]It's not.
[171:08.65]Paint me like one of your old French girls.
[171:10.41]Remember that one from that movie, Titanic?
[171:17.61]Remember that from that movie, Titanic?
[171:25.18]Jackpot.
[171:25.86]Thank you for the jackpot, guys.
[171:29.46]Did those scale?
[171:30.08]I don't know.
[171:40.72]God damn it.
[171:50.67]None of you dropped anything.
[171:53.63]How is that possible?
[171:57.89]I'm not sure actually.
[171:59.09]I at least want to get to see the boss.
[172:08.52]Just this once.
[172:10.12]Just one time.
[172:13.72]I would appreciate it if we could see that.
[172:18.51]I'm yawning again.
[172:20.67]A lot of money.
[172:21.97]Let's see.
[172:22.61]Is this a scale?
[172:23.11]I don't think it does.
[172:37.06]I'm dead.
[172:41.90]I'm dead.
[172:42.56]I'll save you first.
[172:43.08]Alright, quick.
[172:44.80]Give me like infinite money.
[172:46.58]I'm dead.
[172:51.18]Oh, well.
[172:57.98]Let's try her.
[172:58.70]It was two thousandths out of one thousandth.
[173:04.34]Alright.
[173:05.52]This is probably gonna be... This is probably gonna be my last run.
[173:11.26]Maybe.
[173:12.12]We'll see.
[173:13.90]I definitely need more damage.
[173:15.52]Like, I don't even care.
[173:16.84]I'm doing that like four times.
[173:18.74]I need it bad.
[173:21.30]What do I use for a monitor?
[173:22.29]I have a BenQ.
[173:22.89]I have a BenQ monitor.
[173:30.13]I like it.
[173:30.45]I think it's good.
[173:32.86]It's 27 inch, 120 Hertz, BenQ.
[173:38.52]Hey, Neo, thank you for the 750.
[173:39.74]It just says, you just got ooga booga'd, dude.
[173:45.00]I did, I did.
[173:45.64]I got scared.
[173:47.30]BenQ, B-E-N-Q.
[173:53.10]But yeah, I'm getting exhausted.
[173:55.34]I'm getting tired.
[173:58.44]I had a long day.
[173:59.00]It was a really good day, but it was very long.
[174:02.05]Well, there's a double jump.
[174:02.95]Does that mean I get a triple jump?
[174:05.83]Wait a minute.
[174:09.65]Okay, I have a triple jump now.
[174:11.85]That's pretty amazing.
[174:14.30]I just have to remember that.
[174:17.30]Alright, let's make this one a good one.
[174:31.20]I can already feel the damage increase.
[174:35.36]I'm very glad I did that.
[174:36.40]Except no matter what, the damage increase is still... still not good enough.
[174:52.23]Holy shit, that's not good.
[174:55.57]That was a false reality for myself there.
[175:03.40]can run out of ammo in the first room.
[175:17.60]How much is this game?
[175:18.28]This game is 20 bucks.
[175:21.79]Please get it, because it's good.
[175:26.38]Even if you... I mean, let's just say that... Like, there's three pyramids, right?
[175:31.15]Ooh, what's this?
[175:32.63]A new medallion.
[175:33.97]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[175:38.35]There are three pyramids, I guess.
[175:40.95]And I'm not sure what happens after that.
[175:44.32]That's dumb.
[175:49.92]But just... I mean, I've put maybe...
[175:55.01]Poison.
[175:55.39]A small chance of poisoning the enemy.
[175:57.01]Cool.
[175:57.35]That works.
[176:00.29]I've... 10 hours so far?
[176:02.40]Let's see.
[176:02.74]Like 3... 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... Maybe like 12 hours?
[176:06.44]10?
[176:06.46]11?
[176:06.72]Something like that?
[176:07.78]So far?
[176:08.14]I've streamed every second I've played it, so... Where the fuck are these doors, by the way?
[176:16.28]What?
[176:16.46]Am I fucking crazy?
[176:18.36]Oh.
[176:18.68]Okay.
[176:21.07]For 20 bucks...
[176:24.54]You can get really involved with this.
[176:34.71]Seems like there's a lot of content.
[176:38.51]So, I would highly recommend it for $20.
[176:40.69]Yes.
[176:41.77]If you like what you see, definitely go get it.
[176:43.35]I don't want to go all the way down here just shooting one guy.
[176:48.69]That's exactly what I did, though.
[177:04.04]Nice spell.
[177:09.32]Seeing the second pyramid being completely different is a good thing.
[177:11.88]Yeah, that was actually a deal breaker for me.
[177:14.15]Like, I wasn't going to wholeheartedly recommend this game if it was just like a rehash of the first pyramid, but like harder and more enemies.
[177:21.91]So the fact that it is a completely different thing with new enemies, there's no old enemies from the other pyramid.
[177:28.89]That's a huge deal.
[177:30.58]So, yeah, now this has an absolute 100% stamp.
[177:34.43]Put the stamp on the document.
[177:37.73]Completely recommend the game, for sure.
[177:41.07]I would have been very disappointed if I walked in here and it was just, more of those fucking bugs!
[177:46.96]Lava, poison, etc.
[177:48.10]can't hurt you.
[177:49.28]Nice.
[177:53.19]There we go.
[177:57.73]Happy with that.
[177:58.67]Can't get hurt by poison or lava.
[178:01.20]I'll forget that though, and I'll still try to jump over it.
[178:03.16]Don't get stuck there.
[178:14.60]Uh-oh.
[178:17.36]Ah, that was close.
[178:25.83]Lucky Luke.
[178:27.17]Lucky Luke coming up.
[178:31.13]And the developers seem to be fairly dedicated to the game.
[178:34.67]I've noticed that they've patched it quite a few times, I think.
[178:38.42]At least a few times since it launched.
[178:41.80]Wait, this can't hurt me.
[178:43.84]I'm going to test it.
[178:58.38]I'll become a western god at number two.
[179:03.36]It's quite possible.
[179:04.22]This room is useless again, right?
[179:05.94]This is great.
[179:17.04]Don't forget about that triple jump.
[179:18.46]It can get me out of some hairy situations here.
[179:28.36]Another thing is they don't last as long, the drops.
[179:31.58]You need to be very careful of that.
[179:37.66]Infinite ammo in the current floor.
[179:39.15]I mean, that's... I don't like that.
[179:46.71]It should be infinite ammo forever.
[179:49.19]That should be like a golden scroll.
[179:50.55]This doesn't hurt me.
[179:51.40]I don't know why I'm not just walking it.
[180:00.22]Current floor.
[180:00.80]That should be a bright gold scroll.
[180:08.59]It should be like... Wow, dude.
[180:10.55]You got a bright gold scroll.
[180:12.37]You got lucky as hell.
[180:21.07]All the way down here.
[180:23.80]Good guy.
[180:24.32]I don't think I've ever seen a good guy.
[180:25.38]I don't know where good guy is.
[180:34.86]What the hell?
[180:38.12]Looks like we're going this way, because I can't figure out how to get up there.
[180:42.74]The disco ball.
[180:44.96]Disco ball and... Random freaky, creepy Lucario.
[181:02.05]That just pissed out from him.
[181:04.28]What is that?
[181:04.80]Can I do something with that?
[181:08.68]No.
[181:10.76]Come on, you little piss.
[181:19.95]That bar was huge.
[181:21.13]Can I do something here?
[181:27.66]Oh well.
[181:31.91]An Illuminati will follow you and help you on your adventure.
[181:38.54]What?
[181:41.44]Okay.
[181:41.96]This is making an Illuminati reference now.
[181:52.66]This is an Illuminati that's following me.
[181:56.60]Okay.
[181:58.02]Sure thing, game.
[182:06.66]Are they going to shove that into the wall?
[182:18.15]I have infinite ammo.
[182:19.31]Might as well just spam the hell out of this.
[182:28.37]Is it even working?
[182:30.15]I don't know.
[182:30.63]I'm going to say it is.
[182:43.36]Pretty cool.
[182:45.30]Just little frogs.
[182:48.62]And that's it!
[182:52.98]Agility?
[182:53.90]Oh god.
[182:54.48]I'm gonna be able to jump four damn times, huh?
[182:58.28]That's gonna be fun.
[182:58.96]I mean, you might think I'm influencing the vote right now, but I mean, I'm not.
[183:04.58]Look at how much that was winning by.
[183:05.76]I was winning by so much.
[183:10.68]Whoops.
[183:11.64]For some reason I'm trying to go invincible.
[183:23.65]This is gonna be awesome.
[183:29.04]I just got an achievement for that by the way.
[183:41.12]Alright, now I just have to hope that there is a boss that I need to be jumping around at.
[183:47.52]That's so cool.
[183:48.20]1, 2, 3, 4.
[183:49.75]I can pretty much fly.
[183:52.47]Just don't lose.
[183:53.41]Don't die.
[183:55.43]Oh, fuck.
[184:01.35]This is bad.
[184:06.15]Thankfully, the stuns.
[184:07.77]That was lucky.
[184:11.12]Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[184:12.18]I still need to do more damage.
[184:22.73]My damage is such ass right now.
[184:38.01]Needed that more than the money and the ammo.
[184:40.17]I don't fit in ammo right now.
[184:42.69]This doesn't hurt either.
[184:43.45]Uh-huh.
[184:48.91]Getting rid of the Mario Wizard first.
[185:01.38]Mm-hmm.
[185:04.12]Shit.
[185:05.34]I did a full wraparound.
[185:07.35]Oh god.
[185:15.57]Lotta money.
[185:16.23]Four grand.
[185:16.71]Thanks, man.
[185:18.45]Thanks, man.
[185:20.27]Thanks, man.
[185:21.35]Like as if one of you guys just did that.
[185:23.11]Thanks a lot, dude.
[185:23.83]Appreciate that.
[185:24.43]Look up.
[185:28.79]What do you mean look up?
[185:34.20]Oh, so that's the blue shit that's getting shot.
[185:39.58]Now that makes sense.
[185:43.68]Um, go left.
[185:44.56]It's just floating above me.
[185:51.83]It's like a little familiar, that's cool.
[185:56.99]Stood still, that was dumb.
[186:10.02]Actually, fairly effective.
[186:11.70]He's doing a pretty good job.
[186:18.71]What is... Oh, a brain.
[186:30.01]Hmm.
[186:32.78]There's so many ways to go.
[186:34.08]I don't like how many ways to go there are.
[186:42.52]Oh, fuck.
[186:55.52]I ain't dying from that.
[186:57.20]I can guarantee you, you know what I mean?
[187:00.52]That was a lot of money, but I'm full health on that ship, man.
[187:03.32]I ain't gonna lose that much health in this terrible room.
[187:10.06]Gravity becomes like it's Mars!
[187:12.34]So, quadruple jump in low gravity.
[187:19.71]Oh, that's so dumb.
[187:29.90]This is so much fun.
[187:32.90]At least my last run was one of these fun ones, where it was a cool combination.
[187:36.90]I'm not saying the other ones weren't, but still, you know.
[187:54.22]One more frog.
[187:55.87]Two more frogs.
[187:57.31]Frog's dead.
[188:03.55]Isn't there higher gravity on Mars?
[188:04.99]See, that's what I said.
[188:06.86]That is exactly what I said.
[188:08.24]And then people were like, no.
[188:11.14]I was wrong.
[188:15.04]About the same thing.
[188:23.05]I don't know why I did that.
[188:24.07]I just clicked the wrong button.
[188:44.07]Oh, yeah.
[188:47.53]Hello!
[188:50.35]Finally, the exit!
[188:57.92]I'm just skiing around.
[188:59.26]This is great.
[189:00.28]Creases knock back on enemies.
[189:02.70]Heavy bullets.
[189:03.26]Cool.
[189:06.63]I really do love the fact that I can just carousel around this.
[189:09.57]It's so much fun.
[189:12.37]A gun dropped, apparently.
[189:22.53]Is it a rocket launcher?
[189:28.09]That's the dumb potato gun.
[189:29.33]Not even worth picking up.
[189:34.39]Not even worth touching.
[189:41.28]How do I get down there?
[189:45.42]What the fuck?
[189:48.00]How do I... How do I get down there?
[189:57.46]Uh, okay.
[189:58.38]I was gonna say, what?
[190:12.12]That's so fun.
[190:13.22]Mm-hmm.
[190:22.50]Potato gun gets you down there.
[190:23.78]No, it doesn't.
[190:24.56]Potato gun sucks.
[190:27.59]I don't even want it.
[190:28.69]I don't even want to replace the shitty Ankh.
[190:36.67]What?
[190:38.69]What the fuck is happening right now?
[190:43.87]It's down here?
[190:44.83]Okay, I'm losing my mind there for a second.
[190:50.89]Thanks for the crits for the gold.
[190:53.09]Thanks for critsforgold.com Cash for gold.
[190:59.52]Alright, first boss is coming up of this pyramid.
[191:02.26]Let's see if we get our ass kicked by it.
[191:12.54]No, it's not.
[191:12.86]This is the second floor.
[191:13.87]This is only the second floor.
[191:15.79]Why did I think it was not the second floor?
[191:20.31]My brain is on autopilot right now.
[191:26.51]I still have money.
[191:30.32]Oh, I'm sitting there going, why am I reloading?
[191:31.88]That was just for the one floor.
[191:42.32]Yeah, no more infinite ammo.
[191:43.32]It's gone.
[191:49.06]Electric flamethrower.
[191:50.51]No.
[191:51.53]That thing's awful.
[192:04.18]I wish I could fall faster!
[192:23.19]The Illuminati thing is freaking me out because I keep feeling like it's an enemy shooting at me.
[192:26.81]I think I gotta turn around, but I don't even need to turn around.
[192:31.95]Just... Okay, what's in you?
[192:36.03]Ooh.
[192:41.49]Yes, please.
[192:44.03]Yes, please.
[192:56.64]Shit.
[192:57.36]It's okay, I'm good.
[192:58.64]No, I'm not good.
[193:07.28]Those little disco balls.
[193:09.88]Have to die on the ground, I guess, huh?
[193:20.56]I love how you can just do that, though.
[193:22.98]Meat will recover more health.
[193:27.80]Somebody said, I'm really surprised Twitch chat is able to contain themselves and not vote for air is lava.
[193:34.80]We had our funny joke moments.
[193:37.96]We had our fuck the streamer moment a few times.
[193:42.48]Now we're in... I think people want to see the boss.
[193:45.76]I do.
[193:45.98]People want to see what the next pyramid's little mini-boss is.
[193:51.40]I'm in that boat.
[193:52.84]We're all in the boat together.
[193:55.82]Time trial.
[194:01.41]What is a time trial for, by the way?
[194:05.52]What's time trial for?
[194:07.54]Time trial, but what's the trial for?
[194:09.85]Alright, I did it.
[194:16.59]That's a new gun.
[194:20.51]Horus's fate.
[194:26.57]This thing needs to be charged.
[194:30.40]I'm gonna keep it.
[194:36.98]Hey, thanks for the, uh, thanks for the incredible weapon, apparently.
[194:40.34]Wait, right here.
[194:47.20]Okay, that... We're gonna hold on to that one, because that is probably like a boss killer.
[194:56.02]Shit.
[194:58.88]That is so useful, I love it.
[195:04.85]In fact, I want this.
[195:17.55]I'm gonna be Flying Archer, man.
[195:42.03]More weapons!
[195:46.31]You can now find items in vessels.
[195:48.39]Oh, damn.
[195:49.45]Oh, wow.
[195:51.65]Now I have to do... I have to break everything now?
[195:55.43]Oh, God.
[195:56.21]You're making me break everything?
[196:00.62]You guys.
[196:01.50]You guys, now I have to be meticulous about breaking every vase.
[196:04.78]Oh, man.
[196:10.18]Okay, I'm okay with this setup.
[196:38.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[196:40.48]Got it.
[196:42.22]Got it.
[196:43.70]Who's left?
[196:45.44]Do I still have the acid thing?
[196:47.38]I forget if that was this run or the last one.
[196:51.21]Can acid hurt me in this one?
[196:55.83]Well, these guys are like idiots and they're stuck in a corner.
[196:59.26]Where... Where the fuck are you?
[197:11.92]Alright, well, I'll take your word for it, game.
[197:19.14]There's a chest down here, too.
[197:24.25]I'm sick of that guy.
[197:29.91]Shotgun.
[197:37.72]The bone arrow sucks.
[197:39.32]It's not doing enough damage.
[197:40.40]It takes like six shots to kill anybody at this point.
[197:43.14]Might as well go with the big guns.
[197:50.14]Might as well go with the big guns.
[197:52.04]And this is not even the right spot.
[198:02.77]Jesus.
[198:07.31]Improves your attack.
[198:08.05]Nice.
[198:08.31]Thank you.
[198:12.64]Thank you for giving this to me.
[198:13.98]Hopefully we see the mini-boss.
[198:17.72]No!
[198:17.88]Alright, I got it in time.
[198:21.52]Nice.
[198:24.95]What remains?
[198:26.01]Bad guys over here.
[198:48.76]Ah, my god.
[198:49.42]Just die.
[198:49.88]You're fucking annoying.
[198:59.62]These guys are annoying.
[199:01.10]Alright, we can go up to the left.
[199:07.61]I'll do that.
[199:08.93]That looks like a good way to go.
[199:14.29]Shit in the box?
[199:15.07]Here comes the shit.
[199:19.43]So does that actually just make the main character say a swear word and then that's it?
[199:22.80]I think that's it.
[199:31.46]And I didn't even reload this.
[199:32.66]What a bad person.
[199:35.80]Terrible video game player.
[199:42.37]You guys came from behind.
[199:43.67]Nice.
[199:45.35]Not nice at all.
[200:00.48]And... up the stairs, it seems.
[200:15.75]You died.
[200:18.35]You died.
[200:19.29]No, you didn't.
[200:20.77]Now you did.
[200:26.16]This is so cheap, I love it.
[200:31.51]Shit.
[200:38.74]Let's reload and go straight ahead.
[200:41.14]Straight ahead.
[200:41.58]Might as well.
[200:44.48]No.
[200:44.92]This way.
[200:49.25]No.
[200:49.53]It's going to connect to that room.
[200:50.59]Let's keep going this way.
[200:53.09]It connects to this one anyways.
[200:54.37]God damn it.
[201:04.18]That's a new enemy.
[201:05.42]That's a fucking, like, weird, like, TV enemy.
[201:11.14]Whichever the floating CRT TV.
[201:20.26]I can't believe I have to do this.
[201:21.92]I have to, though, right?
[201:29.51]Lucky you.
[201:30.63]It's got achievement for it.
[201:35.08]Whatever.
[201:39.54]I feel like up is gonna... I don't know if I want to go up, but whatever.
[201:42.36]I'm gonna go there anyways.
[201:44.84]Well... It was the correct way, apparently.
[201:56.78]I don't like that I go too fast, that when I break the things open, it doesn't automatically pick them up.
[202:00.98]That's kind of annoying.
[202:06.82]Hey, are we gonna get to the coveted 10,000 bits?
[202:09.02]I think we might.
[202:13.81]It's possible.
[202:28.46]Dudes have health.
[202:29.62]Lots of it.
[202:31.13]What just hit me for a fucking million?
[202:33.79]Wow!
[202:35.69]What the fuck?
[202:38.61]That dude did half my health in one hit.
[202:44.68]Punk.
[202:47.18]Now I have to break all this stuff open.
[202:51.08]The off chance that it meets in here.
[202:55.79]Oh, well.
[202:56.83]I'm...
[202:59.22]Choose your gun wisely, apparently.
[203:02.84]That's alright.
[203:04.24]That's okay.
[203:05.16]Why?
[203:05.94]I didn't even... I was too busy painting to... We didn't even get to see the weird Half-Life gun.
[203:17.41]We got to see what it did, but we didn't get to actually see it.
[203:21.91]Eh, whatever.
[203:37.38]We'll fill our health here.
[203:40.66]Or fucking will we?
[203:45.12]Yeah, we will.
[203:50.67]Don't touch that.
[203:52.75]Do not.
[203:53.45]And it's already over.
[203:55.99]It's already over.
[203:57.35]That sure was fun for that one room.
[203:59.21]If you guys enjoyed it, that was cool.
[204:16.49]God, David, that sucks.
[204:18.07]That really sucks.
[204:26.73]Come on, almost at 10,000 bits.
[204:30.26]I have to break 10,000 bits before I die.
[204:33.24]Or lose.
[204:35.70]Whatever happens to people when they don't win a game.
[204:53.10]What you what does it take takes hitting them is what it takes Coming out of nowhere I'm gonna have no ammo guys
[205:18.17]I need a better gun.
[205:21.25]I need a gun that's not gonna, like, do me wrong, you know what I mean?
[205:23.27]Slows enemies on the mini-map.
[205:24.56]Shows enemies on the mini-map.
[205:27.84]Hey, I just got 10,000 bits.
[205:29.46]You're right, I did.
[205:32.70]Even more than that.
[205:33.34]Somebody had some, like, leftover bits right there, too.
[205:36.38]Nice.
[205:36.80]Leftover bits.
[205:49.16]Now, can we get to 15,000?
[205:50.08]These things, how could you have a grenade that's not an instant kill?
[206:07.29]Like, are you serious?
[206:10.67]Seems almost like a joke.
[206:15.67]Alright, get him, Illuminati.
[206:18.33]Kill the mummy, please.
[206:20.81]Or I will.
[206:21.27]Don't worry.
[206:25.13]I'll take care of it.
[206:30.40]Break some vases?
[206:31.20]No, I don't even... I'm done with that shit.
[206:34.10]If it's a room of vases, then maybe.
[206:35.62]But I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna drive myself silly because of it.
[206:40.45]I'm up top.
[206:47.08]It's the same damn thing.
[206:49.10]Sticky grenade launcher.
[206:50.84]Okay.
[206:56.46]Down.
[206:58.12]Acrobat.
[207:00.00]What is Acrobat gonna do?
[207:03.00]Am I gonna be able to fly?
[207:07.75]You guys are gonna make me fly.
[207:18.84]Uh, now I can see where they are.
[207:20.14]Well, I hear a lot of frogs.
[207:36.13]Don't see a lot of frogs.
[207:41.30]Here they come.
[207:43.20]No?
[207:43.30]Where the hell are they?
[207:46.08]Frogs.
[207:47.10]Increases your attack in the air.
[207:53.34]That's so awesome.
[207:54.70]Oh, I got... What was that?
[208:01.26]I'm going to be in aerial danger now.
[208:03.70]I love it.
[208:04.06]Okay, I need to get this ready.
[208:11.65]Yeah, more jumps.
[208:19.42]These grenades are terrible, but you best believe I'm not going down there with a bunch of frogs.
[208:22.84]Alright, I think it's safe.
[208:42.63]Very nice.
[208:45.79]This way.
[208:49.98]And then up.
[208:51.40]Nope.
[208:52.34]Shit.
[208:53.18]Gotta go up, up, up.
[209:00.22]Oh boy.
[209:00.82]Boss.
[209:01.86]Everybody calm down.
[209:03.32]I have no idea what to do.
[209:05.74]Maddy, lord of the wicked.
[209:17.52]I really can just like fly around.
[209:25.76]Oh, this is cool.
[209:33.40]There's like shit to avoid on the ground and I'm just like flying around it.
[209:46.55]Ooh!
[209:50.29]Look at how much shit is on the ground here.
[209:53.83]Get fucking destroyed.
[209:59.62]That was like way easier because I could fly.
[210:04.77]I have Horus's thing.
[210:05.57]No, I lost it.
[210:08.83]It got lost in the abyss when I got a new scroll.
[210:11.65]An additional jump.
[210:14.49]Are you guys for real?
[210:18.13]No way.
[210:21.58]There's a new Maddy Medallion.
[210:29.66]Machine gun.
[210:31.60]I'm gonna... These are awful.
[210:34.89]One, two, three, four, five.
[210:38.69]Oh my god.
[210:42.53]Holy... I might... Time to start ruining the run?
[210:48.80]No, don't do that.
[210:49.68]Are you kidding me?
[210:52.38]This is like... We got a dream run here.
[210:59.89]I can almost legitimately fly without needing to hit the ground.
[211:03.57]Low gravity.
[211:05.24]Right?
[211:05.86]Like, this is perfect.
[211:09.20]Break a bunch of shit and I get money?
[211:11.39]That's awesome.
[211:27.03]I mean, I don't really do a whole lot of damage to these guys, though.
[211:29.51]That's the one thing that's gonna hold me back.
[211:41.69]Get stickied!
[211:44.54]Alright, not gonna lie, that was actually pretty cool.
[211:58.73]I want more ammo on this thing, come on.
[212:09.52]This thing's a little too inaccurate.
[212:13.84]You can just float next to him.
[212:17.53]Alright guys, who wants to fight the floating person?
[212:33.91]Damn, these guys really take too much damage.
[212:37.81]I think I hit the wall.
[212:39.63]I really think I did.
[212:42.25]Because we're at the second part.
[212:43.77]Your defense is higher when you attack from behind.
[212:46.35]Nice.
[212:53.17]I think we may have actually hit the wall.
[212:57.04]At least for damage.
[213:02.50]I think so.
[213:09.70]One more guy, here we go.
[213:17.29]Let's fly!
[213:34.32]That is such dog shit, I love it.
[213:41.09]Don't kill the run.
[213:44.15]Don't kill the run is right.
[213:47.64]We have an opportunity here.
[213:52.36]To be the best we've ever been.
[214:00.02]The weapons really are more to be desired.
[214:03.00]They are.
[214:03.50]This thing is cool, but... It's too long of a reload.
[214:14.61]Too long?
[214:15.01]Okay, that weapon is way too long of a reload and doesn't have enough shots.
[214:18.51]This thing is way too inaccurate.
[214:20.13]It's super inaccurate.
[214:35.71]Okay... And you're giving me the speedrun, boys.
[214:38.67]Thanks for the speedrun, boys and girls.
[214:45.26]I appreciate it.
[214:46.48]I appreciate you.
[214:49.50]God giveth and God taketh away.
[214:51.17]That's true.
[214:52.23]Did I ever play Titanfall 2?
[214:53.49]No, I did not.
[214:54.65]I did not.
[214:57.63]Game sucks.
[214:58.31]What?
[214:58.99]What are you on about?
[215:04.94]Jumping grants you a temporary speed bonus.
[215:09.44]Holy shit.
[215:16.76]Have you guys lost your damn minds?
[215:32.09]Too many people.
[215:33.53]Too many people.
[215:41.82]You forgot where I was, didn't you?
[215:50.70]I'm almost at that coveted 15,000 bits, guys.
[215:53.78]That's gonna be cool.
[216:06.23]Mm-hmm.
[216:08.51]Okay.
[216:13.86]Getting there.
[216:25.87]There's the ammo I was looking for.
[216:27.19]Load up all the guns.
[216:29.73]All of them.
[216:36.11]I love how some people really are trying to do a new beginning and really fuck this up.
[216:41.98]Oh, I would be very, very upset with you all.
[216:46.88]Make a joke how you don't want bad scrolls.
[216:51.68]Hey, Neo!
[216:52.52]Thank you, Neo, for the $7.
[216:54.42]Oh, more than that.
[216:57.46]Thanks for the eight bucks, Neo.
[216:59.99]Equip the railgun.
[217:02.31]I lost it, unfortunately.
[217:04.13]That stinks.
[217:06.45]Stinks to lose something that good, but you know.
[217:11.48]The Lord giveth.
[217:14.78]The Lord take from you.
[217:16.72]Somebody said that.
[217:18.18]Somebody just said that, but I said it wrong.
[217:20.75]You know what I meant to say.
[217:23.37]That is a disaster room.
[217:32.59]Meat will also give you ammo.
[217:36.07]Very nice.
[217:40.46]That's exactly what I was looking for.
[217:42.46]I want a gun like that.
[217:45.62]No bullshit.
[217:47.40]That's a double-barreled pistol, right?
[217:57.33]Get rid of this.
[217:59.79]Yeah.
[218:03.37]Absolutely.
[218:04.29]I'm doing way more damage now.
[218:05.73]It's so much more accurate.
[218:06.91]The thing with the Uzi, that machine gun, was really cool, but in the air, when you're moving like that, it just becomes an inaccurate mess.
[218:16.70]It becomes a total mess.
[218:21.06]Let's break some pots and get some free shit.
[218:29.61]I could be so meticulous about this, but I can't.
[218:32.45]It's just too much for my brain to like want to do.
[218:35.23]I will do this though.
[218:56.61]Oh, he's still alive.
[219:00.35]You shouldn't have been.
[219:01.15]There we go.
[219:03.11]Reload.
[219:09.57]Those little turkeys do an absolute crapload of fucking damage.
[219:14.93]For being little useless enemies.
[219:20.35]Ow, that hurts.
[219:20.95]At least there's a chest.
[219:37.78]Beautiful.
[219:39.40]Gonna get fully stocked.
[219:51.57]All bad choices.
[219:52.87]Coward.
[219:53.29]Attacks from behind will inflict more damage on you.
[219:55.73]What have you... What is... What is... What is this?
[220:00.59]What is this nonsense that you're doing right now?
[220:05.41]Which, uh, I'm supposed to be having a fun time here.
[220:11.18]I'm not supposed to be ruining it.
[220:16.60]Don't you ruin it on me.
[220:17.98]We have, this is the last floor.
[220:19.24]We have one floor left.
[220:21.98]And then, wham bam.
[220:25.04]We get to see the boss.
[220:26.50]The actual boss.
[220:28.22]Don't you guys want to see the actual pyramid scheme boss?
[220:31.82]Guess who it is.
[220:32.36]It's fucking Bernie Madoff.
[220:41.78]What am I doing?
[220:42.10]I should be flying.
[220:49.59]Wow, these guys are tough.
[220:58.05]15,000 bits.
[220:58.29]That's right.
[220:58.69]Thank you for reminding me.
[220:59.65]There it is.
[221:00.67]We did it.
[221:02.36]We made it to 15,000.
[221:02.92]This is a very awkward place to be doing this, by the way.
[221:08.68]I should go down.
[221:23.75]Alright.
[221:30.00]Let's see if we can find out what the... If I didn't have this great shit right now... Actually, I'm surprised I'm getting to the top of the next pyramid.
[221:44.40]Here we are.
[221:47.20]Wish me luck.
[221:48.62]Probably gonna lose to the boss, because, you know, there's gonna be like a green... There's gonna be a green orb I need to shoot, and I won't be able to do it, because I'm fucking brainless.
[222:01.85]Okay.
[222:09.85]I guess this is the last floor, right?
[222:11.97]Yeah.
[222:18.30]A large room.
[222:21.00]And there's the metamorphosis.
[222:23.42]Nice.
[222:30.23]Was that three chickens in a row?
[222:31.49]That seems pretty rare.
[222:53.70]Death from above Concentration mode Easy as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
[223:30.35]It must be so annoying to shoot at for these guys.
[223:34.62]And this is the end right here.
[223:36.12]We lucked out.
[223:37.38]Are you guys ready?
[223:40.00]Who's ready to see me lose?
[223:41.70]Fucking TVs and shit down here.
[223:58.36]I'm so scared of this room.
[223:59.36]I'm just going to wait for them to come to me and just inhale them down the hallway.
[224:09.11]And there we are.
[224:12.05]And loaded.
[224:16.07]Only one more crab person.
[224:19.84]Alright.
[224:22.28]Let's give it a rock and roll here.
[224:29.37]Boss time.
[224:33.47]So, uh, win or lose.
[224:36.31]This is gonna be the end here.
[224:37.71]Win or lose.
[224:38.11]I'm gonna have a lot of money too, so that's good.
[224:44.39]Alright, lucky Luke.
[224:45.65]Infinite ammo on the current floor.
[224:47.71]Alright, we win.
[224:48.67]I win.
[224:49.33]Perfect fucking timing.
[224:50.81]Infinite ammo on the current floor.
[224:52.15]We're just gonna spam the fuck out of this.
[224:55.17]Perfect.
[224:56.27]I can't lose now.
[224:59.47]Thanks everybody for letting me not lose.
[225:01.27]Because now I can't.
[225:03.49]Okay.
[225:06.55]I say that now and I'm going to lose right now.
[225:09.05]Oh, shit.
[225:09.99]It's Anubis.
[225:13.49]Oh, no.
[225:13.81]It's the Sandcastle Man.
[225:15.89]Temsep.
[225:16.67]The Bonebreaker.
[225:17.37]Okay.
[225:19.11]Try not to lose.
[225:24.38]Will he like... Okay.
[225:25.62]Okay.
[225:32.00]Okay, change his direction.
[225:33.04]He changed his direction.
[225:36.13]I can't hurt him yet.
[225:36.87]Okay, I need to slow this down.
[225:39.21]Alright, now I can hurt him.
[225:49.46]Okay.
[225:52.38]What is hitting me?
[225:58.93]Okay, this is not so much a boss fight as it is like avoid the fucking dance party.
[226:04.15]I gotta keep moving.
[226:11.59]Okay.
[226:13.23]Here comes the fire.
[226:14.67]Alright.
[226:24.88]Just run with it.
[226:25.46]Just run with it.
[226:25.98]Just run with it.
[226:32.40]See those fucking movements?
[226:33.30]Fucking, you know what they got?
[226:34.41]I belong on fucking Twitter.TV.
[227:06.76]Every time you shoot, there's a chance that a phoenix comes out.
[227:08.88]Alright, I gotta be like careful.
[227:10.18]I like bite die here.
[227:18.60]That's not hurting him, by the way.
[227:20.86]Like, I was told to use the grenade launcher, that shit don't even hurt him.
[227:33.89]Oh god, I'm freaking out!
[227:39.60]That's why they fucking let me come on Twitter.TV.
[227:41.82]Fuck.
[227:42.90]It's over.
[227:45.87]It was the fucking asshole that told me to use the grenade launcher.
[227:49.13]Use the grenade launcher.
[227:50.49]Didn't fucking do any damage to him.
[227:55.87]I'm going home.
[227:59.36]The grenade launcher doesn't do damage to him.
[228:03.40]If I didn't switch out from using the fucking thing I was using, I wouldn't have fucking had to worry about that.
[228:08.56]And I wouldn't have to worry about fucking Twitter.TV partnership.
[228:12.24]Oh God, give me a fucking break.
[228:25.61]What a load of dog shit.
[228:28.48]Hey, maybe if, like, the game wasn't broken, and, like, the fucking grenade launcher did damage to the fucking boss.
[228:34.58]Just, you know what?
[228:36.00]That's not gonna fucking happen again.
[228:37.30]There we go.
[228:42.22]Staying up till 4 AM.
[228:43.73]No.
[228:45.87]Blame chat?
[228:46.25]No, blame fucking... What's the name of the company that made this game?
[228:52.36]Argyle suck gaming?
[228:54.12]Argyle sucks?
[228:55.26]I think they made this game?
[228:56.96]Ask him why the grenade launcher doesn't do damage to the fucking boss.
[229:04.43]Alright, goodnight.
[229:05.45]I'm going to fucking bed.
[229:07.47]I'll see you guys later.

[229:15.58]Tell him to fix that shit.
[229:16.76]And then, like, by the way, play this game.
