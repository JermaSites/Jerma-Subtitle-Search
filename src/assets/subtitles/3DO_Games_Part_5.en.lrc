[00:44.06]What's up?
[00:44.88]How's it going?
[00:47.28]Welcome to another edition of Hanging Out, Talking, and Other Things.
[00:57.49]This broadcast is brought to you by me.
[00:59.17]How you doing?
[01:04.26]Good to see you.
[01:14.49]Got my coffee, I'm ready.
[01:16.85]For those of you that don't know, today, just like last week, we're going to be exploring some more of the wonderful, wild, interesting world of the 3DO.
[01:30.48]And I will tell you, today's stream is not going to be one you're going to want to miss.
[01:37.01]I've got some, I would call them bangers.
[01:41.49]Didn't show them last time.
[01:42.55]I want to make sure I had good content for this one too.
[01:46.34]Do we really give a fuck about that anymore?
[01:49.56]Not really.
[01:54.76]I still have a lot to do.
[01:56.40]I don't think we're going to get through them all this stream.
[01:58.48]I really don't.
[02:00.68]I'll give you a little health update.
[02:02.14]Still wicked fucked up.
[02:03.84]Okay.
[02:04.24]Alright.
[02:04.44]Let's move on from that.
[02:06.60]uh thing is still a little weird with my my body but you know we do what we have to do and we just try to get healthy from here okay whatever
[02:23.70]I've gotten to a place which is like this is like the weird part so like I was like a month or two ago I like could barely get out of bed I was fucked up I've gotten better to a point where there's just a wall now here and I've done blood tests I've done fucking all kinds of TMI tests okay
[02:47.52]Still trying to figure out what's going on.
[02:48.76]I have this some type of infection.
[02:52.02]Whatever it is.
[02:53.44]I don't know.
[02:55.00]That might even be inaccurate too.
[02:57.98]But there is an elevated level in my blood.
[03:02.51]And we're gonna figure out what the fuck it is.
[03:11.45]Okay.
[03:14.83]He's got the plague.
[03:20.76]uh it's weird because this is the I want to say this is kind of the I don't know it's it's both the sickest I've been probably ever but not really though like I'm still I'm I'm still okay there's a lot of weird symptoms especially down in the gut so whatever I've been drinking peppermint tea okay let's get that out of the way who cares
[03:52.71]Are you shitting yourself?
[03:54.61]You said pooping yourself, but this is a mature audience stream.
[03:56.93]I'm going to have to change it to the other word.
[03:59.89]Oh, pooping?
[04:00.49]No, no, we use the adult word here, OK?
[04:03.83]You had to click the button saying that you were fucking old enough to be here.
[04:07.98]OK.
[04:14.80]Beagle funny.
[04:16.62]I need to like another coffee too, like my coffee is cold.
[04:22.36]What is this?
[04:23.84]Unbelievable.
[04:25.96]Here's the worst first world problem in the world.
[04:29.43]When you make a coffee and you pour it and then you just go do a bunch of bullshit.
[04:34.71]I gotta take a phone call.
[04:35.39]Hold on.
[04:36.09]That nice fresh cup of coffee is sitting there and it hasn't been sipped yet.
[04:40.95]And then I got grabbed over here.
[04:42.51]Hold on a second.
[04:42.97]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[04:44.46]I gotta move that desk.
[04:46.48]And then when you take a sip out of it for the first time, you go, this is kind of like lukewarm.
[04:53.11]This is not, the steam is not coming out of the top of it.
[04:55.35]I'm unhappy.
[05:02.13]Again, we have some bangers today.
[05:04.15]I'm telling you, I'm waiting for one of these in particular because I'm going to make a... Let's make a statement here just really quickly.
[05:11.18]Might be the best game I've ever played on the stream.
[05:13.24]It could be.
[05:14.40]It might be the best game I've ever played on the stream.
[05:17.00]Wow, what a statement.
[05:17.86]It's been about 3,000 video games.
[05:20.07]Could be one of the greatest video games I've ever played.
[05:22.15]I'm going to have to have you guess which one.
[05:28.73]Alright, you know what?
[05:29.75]Let me make a coffee.
[05:30.45]I'll be right back.
[05:31.83]Probably going to go for like five or six hours today.
[05:34.90]Imagining.
[05:36.26]Just going to chill, hang out.
[05:37.14]Talk some shit.
[05:38.94]You know how it is.
[05:39.38]I'll be right back.
[05:41.69]Let me make another coffee.
[05:42.43]Come on.
[05:43.75]Give me two seconds.
[05:45.29]Two minutes.
[09:14.85]Okay, children, are we all ready?
[09:18.06]Are you all seated, children?
[09:28.20]Yes, we are.
[09:28.92]Yes, okay.
[09:31.09]We got a teaser of this one coming up first.
[09:35.13]Again, I'm on original hardware, by the way.
[09:39.01]Yeah, that's it.
[09:42.51]Uh, last time we played one of those sampler CDs, we got this in the, uh, in the sampler.
[09:49.45]We got to play like a 10 to 15 second demo, but I wanted to see the real thing.
[09:54.52]Uh, this one's called Siberia with a C Y B E R I A.
[10:03.68]I don't know where I'm going to put my coffee now.
[10:05.74]I made it and there's nowhere to put anything.
[10:07.34]I'm surrounded by fucking gadgets.
[10:10.04]Those of you that think that streaming is just, oh, I'm just going to stream.
[10:13.52]Maybe sometimes.
[10:14.91]I am surrounded by gadgets.
[10:17.47]There are one, two, three, four, five, six, there are eight gadgets around me and I can't put my coffee down.
[10:23.59]There's so many wires coming out of me.
[10:27.75]What do I do with this?
[10:29.19]Alright, I'm gonna have to put it over here.
[10:30.97]If this spills... Oh my god, if it spills... What, like a funny moment you can clip it?
[10:36.76]It's like, oh my god, Jervis spilled his coffee on himself!
[10:40.64]Fuck outta here.
[10:44.18]Why am I on the warpath today?
[10:45.72]I don't... Why am I so mean right now?
[10:48.60]I don't know what's got me so... What's got me so mad today.
[10:51.10]Alright.
[10:55.30]This is an adults only stream.
[10:57.54]Fucking get used to it.
[10:58.54]Okay, here we go.
[11:01.86]This one's called Siberia.
[11:03.89]We're ready to start it on.
[11:06.19]And I'm excited.
[11:06.99]Here we go.
[11:14.53]You can hear it?
[11:17.43]Can you hear it?
[11:20.59]You sure can.
[11:23.91]Alright, I'm gonna have to do a test to make sure the audio sync.
[11:31.37]This is interplay.
[11:31.97]Remember we talked about interplay.
[11:35.36]Let me know if it's too loud.
[11:36.24]It's probably gonna be wicked loud.
[11:53.55]Hey, by the way, I want to make this really clear.
[11:55.13]This is video footage.
[11:56.68]No other game company found a fucking emerald asteroid and put their name engraved into it.
[12:03.22]One of the, oh, the first company ever to do that.
[12:04.80]This is a full motion video.
[12:05.66]That's a real, that's a real video.
[12:13.53]Here we go.
[12:26.73]What the hell is that?
[12:40.30]Please enter identification.
[12:43.68]Okay.
[12:45.20]Well, I still haven't put my coffee down.
[12:47.20]I've been holding, I just lied to you guys and I'm embarrassed that there's no way to put this.
[12:50.72]Alright, here we go.
[12:51.16]I got it right there.
[12:53.78]Identification.
[12:56.88]Oh, it actually says the thing.
[12:59.61]Delete.
[13:00.71]Does it say this?
[13:01.41]What about, like, backspace?
[13:04.07]I can't have my name be backspace?
[13:06.57]M. Delete.
[13:10.63]Wait, if I... Yeah, I stole this from chat, but it's funny.
[13:14.33]I. C. I. P. Well, everybody does that.
[13:20.94]Delete.
[13:21.62]Let me fix it.
[13:23.62]I.
[13:25.47]C-U-P.
[13:29.01]Oh my God, clip that.
[13:33.64]Delete, delete, delete.
[13:37.62]We have to do the test.
[13:38.50]Okay?
[13:40.28]So I have to make sure that I'm matching up somewhat.
[13:42.68]Because everyone, again, I've got to make this clear.
[13:45.58]Every one of these games has a different disk spin speed that gets captured.
[13:51.44]I'm making that up.
[13:52.37]I'm just trying to sound intelligent enough.
[13:54.01]But that's the only thing that makes any sense to me.
[13:56.83]Because every disk, every new game, has a different capture speed.
[14:01.65]I made that up.
[14:02.57]This is not real.
[14:03.73]But I'm just telling you that's how I perceive it.
[14:05.29]Ready?
[14:06.01]Ready?
[14:07.42]So I'm going to say F, F, F, F, F, F, right, left, right, right, left, right.
[14:16.08]We good?
[14:21.48]Is it OK?
[14:27.98]I'm seeing I'm seeing some very off, kind of off, not really.
[14:32.92]My voice is early.
[14:35.08]Yeah, this is important.
[14:36.26]K, K, K. We should be saying K, K, L, L, L, J, J, J. We should be saying it at the same time.
[14:47.87]Am I late or am I early?
[14:48.73]Okay, so you're hearing me late.
[14:55.01]Alright, I got it.
[14:59.04]Thank you for participating.
[15:09.06]How about now?
[15:12.98]H H H G G G F F F still late.
[15:21.65]Okay.
[15:32.21]Alright, how about now?
[15:33.69]Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[15:36.80]Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[15:41.10]L, L, L. We good?
[15:46.42]Almost there.
[15:48.76]Still, still almost there.
[15:53.13]Love that we do that.
[15:53.69]We have to, we have to do this for every single one, by the way.
[15:57.49]Alright, I'm, I'm, it's going to be good enough after this.
[15:59.85]I don't care.
[16:03.57]Alright, here it is.
[16:04.15]This should be it.
[16:06.45]L, L, L, J, J, M, M. That's good enough.
[16:11.69]Alright, that's what we're using.
[16:15.34]I don't even care.
[16:16.58]The name is not going to do anything.
[16:19.64]Select arcade level.
[16:21.36]Arcade level.
[16:23.84]Select arcade easy.
[16:25.56]Medium difficult.
[16:26.76]Medium easy.
[16:27.70]Medium difficult.
[16:28.76]Medium easy.
[16:30.61]I think I'm just going to do easy.
[16:35.71]Welcome to Siberia.
[16:38.91]I'm not doing as medium back in 1993 is like insane mode now.
[16:43.47]Alright, cutscene.
[16:58.06]That's it?
[16:58.44]Oh, I thought we were going to get a whole thing.
[17:00.28]I thought we were going to get a whole thing.
[17:06.20]Oh, God.
[17:06.68]Santa?
[17:26.24]Not to worry, you won't be flying this one.
[17:28.24]The auto-nav is set to take you by optimum route to the Siberia complex.
[17:32.97]Trust is a wonderful thing.
[17:34.33]I think I got a solitary, didn't I?
[17:37.13]Can't have you jetting around the globe instead of getting a job done, my man.
[17:41.66]Just what is a job, Devlin?
[17:43.98]Like I said, always to the point.
[17:45.88]Alright, stand by.
[17:46.74]I'm gonna shoot you some currents on the Siberia project.
[17:49.88]See, my favorite kind of voice acting is when it's so natural sounding that it's unnatural sounding.
[17:56.82]It's weird how that happens.
[17:58.14]You know, like, we could conversational kind of talking.
[18:03.10]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[18:03.72]I'm just trying to, you know, be an actor.
[18:05.47]You know, I'm just trying to act.
[18:06.51]And the thing is, it's actually way better than the other way.
[18:11.61]Because the other way is, I'm just trying to do, I'm telling you here's what's happening right now.
[18:16.31]There's no way to make anybody happy.
[18:17.73]That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[18:19.39]There's so many talented people out there that do it either way.
[18:22.35]You're never going to make everybody happy.
[18:23.57]What the fuck is going on right now?
[18:26.05]Why am I walking around and flying into stuff?
[18:27.80]Am I an insect?
[18:31.16]Why was that guy sleeping?
[18:32.96]Why was that guy asleep?
[18:33.94]Why were we just looking at this guy sleeping?
[18:39.82]Why do we still have the visor up?
[18:46.90]That was just a dream.
[18:48.52]I've had dreams that were like that.
[18:49.74]And then you wake up and you only remember the guy sleeping.
[18:52.93]So that's it.
[18:54.83]Infiltrate the complex and find the Siberia weapon.
[18:57.87]What do I do with it once I find it?
[19:03.07]The disk speed just went... I don't know if you heard that.
[19:12.32]It's weird because I prefer this type of voice acting.
[19:16.10]I'll tell you in a minute.
[19:19.16]I've made this statement before, but I'm going to make it clear again.
[19:25.25]When you can see the glasses on the bridge of the nose and the hand in the air curling while the actor does the lines.
[19:34.28]I feel like I'm noticing that.
[19:36.62]Like I can see the glasses at the bridge of the nose in the booth.
[19:40.04]Like in the studio.
[19:41.74]And like I can feel the hand in the air like doing the voice lines.
[19:55.34]Are you high right now?
[19:56.80]What do you care?
[19:57.30]Am I playing the game now?
[20:02.80]Oh my god, that's me!
[20:06.40]I just... Okay, what do I do?
[20:09.44]I missed all of that.
[20:12.95]No, no, no, no.
[20:13.57]Turn around, turn around.
[20:18.13]I guess I'm just going to keep walking this way.
[20:20.35]Okay, report to...
[20:25.91]Don't wander around.
[20:26.81]Well, guess what?
[20:27.41]I get to do whatever I want.
[20:29.91]I'm going left.
[20:30.53]Uh-oh.
[20:38.16]Is he mad at me because I did this?
[20:39.48]Uh-oh.
[20:45.02]I don't know how to turn around.
[20:50.99]That was very odd, but okay.
[20:54.33]What is this?
[20:54.67]A toilet?
[21:05.51]Honestly, you know what?
[21:06.09]Fuck it, man.
[21:08.92]Here's my work policy.
[21:11.22]Like, when you get to work, like, you should be able just to do this.
[21:13.86]Just kind of walk around.
[21:14.64]Just who cares?
[21:15.96]Just, like, get ready for the day.
[21:18.74]I don't want you showing up to work wicked fucked up.
[21:21.50]Like, oh my god, I was in traffic and I got fucked.
[21:23.71]There was so much bullshit to deal with.
[21:25.33]I want you to wander around in the lobby and, like, look at your phone for 20 minutes.
[21:29.17]And then, like, then you're going to be alright.
[21:30.45]Then, like, you know, the cortisol level will drop.
[21:34.48]And then you can get to work.
[21:37.24]I don't know.
[21:37.64]This whole thing of like... Like, John said you were late by one minute.
[21:41.69]Next time when you clock in like that, we're going to fucking take 50 cents off your next... Yeah, hourly paycheck.
[21:46.57]No, just who fucking cares?
[21:47.59]You know how much cortisol is going through that person?
[21:52.83]Alright, I made it through the door.
[22:03.27]You didn't tell me where to go after going in the door.
[22:08.31]No, I went, I go this.
[22:09.71]What are you doing?
[22:10.27]Alright.
[22:14.03]Really use it up that, uh, that pre work 15 minute thing that I talked about.
[22:21.94]Okay.
[22:22.12]Here's the problem.
[22:24.64]I'm, there's no rhyme or reason to what any of these buttons are doing.
[22:28.37]I'm turning, but sometimes I'll press right on the D-pad and he'll walk forward.
[22:33.77]So right now I, okay, I'm pressing up.
[22:38.04]I have to press up for him to walk forward.
[22:41.30]So I have to, it's like as if I'm piloting.
[22:43.92]So right is, he'll turn right.
[22:45.66]Okay.
[22:46.86]Then up.
[22:47.97]Got it.
[22:51.69]You're much funnier than all the YouTube highlights that I see of you.
[22:56.35]Wait, what?
[22:57.33]I'm just trying to go to work, lady.
[23:00.61]Turn around and disarm the weapon.
[23:02.71]I don't know how to do that.
[23:09.29]Who the fuck is this lady?
[23:11.25]What?
[23:12.17]Who is this lady?
[23:13.49]Why did you just do that?
[23:15.29]What?
[23:21.38]The controls don't make any sense if I just tried to turn around.
[23:26.26]Turn around nice and slow and disarm the weapon.
[23:30.43]Okay, is that if I press left right now, I'm going to turn towards her.
[23:36.21]Okay, there we go.
[23:36.91]Do you remember you never heard of tank controls?
[23:44.44]I was born in tank controls.
[23:45.90]I played Resident Evil 1 for the PlayStation 1.
[23:48.16]So this is one of my... So why did this lady want to kill me?
[23:50.42]We're just working to... Okay, now we're under attack.
[23:53.55]You're running way too slow.
[23:54.45]I'm coming!
[23:54.77]Wait, no, no, no, no!
[23:55.33]Turn around!
[23:56.73]What are you doing?
[24:18.78]What gun?
[24:19.16]Where's the gun?
[24:19.52]Is there a gun?
[24:21.46]I have to go right?
[24:28.52]None of the buttons work!
[24:30.85]No!
[24:31.27]Go the- I am telling you, I promise you none of the buttons did anything.
[24:52.34]So wait, there was a bomb that was exploding with intent.
[24:54.93]This whole thing is weird.
[24:56.45]Turn around nice and slow and disarm the weapon.
[25:00.57]Okay, disarm the weapon.
[25:01.71]Turn it off.
[25:04.70]We should be way more concerned about the bomb that explodes in 10 seconds.
[25:11.84]Is this how you greet all your new arrivals?
[25:13.36]That's actually true.
[25:14.14]Auto saves in a game that's 25 years old like this?
[25:16.39]That's kind of insane.
[25:17.19]Quit screwing around and bring him to my office.
[25:19.83]Alright, let's go.
[25:20.19]Alright, go.
[25:20.75]Is it bad if I get too close?
[25:22.29]Take the gun on the right.
[25:25.67]Got it.
[25:25.91]Okay.
[25:45.99]This is a gun?
[25:47.29]Oh, it's the big gun.
[25:48.59]I thought it was more like a pistol.
[25:53.58]Where did I get sunglasses?
[25:54.48]Did I have these?
[25:55.14]Oh, I've been looking through them the whole time.
[25:57.54]That's what I don't understand about the intro.
[25:58.58]I was flying around.
[25:59.32]It was weird.
[26:03.16]Rat movie ending?
[26:04.08]That's true.
[26:08.19]I love this old stuff.
[26:09.85]It's so wonderful.
[26:19.09]uh it's inverted controls fighters coming in got it there I hate inverted controls I can't stand it did we do it uh the game just crashed and then the disk started
[26:46.46]Okay, this is literally just a GTA hacked server.
[26:48.84]Like, that's all this is.
[26:52.48]This is like what you see in the sky.
[27:05.57]These people are... They're gonna crash into each other.
[27:12.27]I didn't even kill anything.
[27:20.88]I'm so glad I put it on easy.
[27:22.98]What is that?
[27:25.78]Is it a drone?
[27:28.72]There are way too many things attacking.
[27:32.71]Stop the sound!
[27:36.97]I'm trying!
[27:52.85]Oh shit, they're in the water.
[27:53.75]Hey, by the way, this is the sound my PC made 10 years ago when I built it and cried because it didn't work.
[28:06.36]That's a true story, by the way.
[28:07.46]Where are these bombs?
[28:26.16]more oh god no the thing just spun around in a circle that thing that guy wasn't even piloting that that was just a that was a new player that was okay that was when you play battlefield for the first time and you try to spam get in the plane and then you finally get in it and you do that and you go well I'm not gonna be able to do that like ever again
[28:56.44]How long is this attack?
[29:07.41]Okay, they just crashed into each other.
[29:09.03]This level is way too long.
[29:30.05]No, please, I can't lose right now.
[29:39.92]Alright, is this an entire fucking country's military?
[29:43.56]Why are there so many things?
[29:45.00]This is like an entire military.
[29:55.08]Okay.
[29:58.56]Alright, I'm gonna try this one more time, and now I understand what's going on.
[30:03.60]One more time.
[30:12.81]I didn't know there were mines down there.
[30:14.17]I figured that out halfway through.
[30:21.50]Alright, here we go.
[30:22.62]Inverted controls, puke.
[30:25.04]Mines that float in, puke.
[30:33.24]Alright, I'm not going to get hit once.
[30:37.06]Much better.
[31:01.15]We need to see what happens after this.
[31:02.31]There's no way I'm going to not do that.
[31:03.41]Are you kidding me?
[31:03.93]Do you think we're going to give up on this one?
[31:15.23]Oh my god.
[31:24.21]Shields, come on.
[31:37.96]Come on.
[31:38.30]I need it.
[31:38.80]I need this.
[31:49.84]Good.
[31:50.28]That was a good random.
[31:52.22]Good RNG.
[31:52.60]Clear.
[32:19.09]Why is my fire rate so low now?
[32:26.07]Is my weapon overheating?
[32:27.31]Dude, how am I supposed to kill all this stuff?
[32:32.46]It's uneasy.
[32:33.34]There's so many things to kill.
[32:41.07]What does this look like on hard?
[32:42.85]Because I wonder it might be worth going back and doing it because it might just spawn three or four times as many enemies.
[32:49.33]Alright, come on.
[32:59.78]Turn the volume down.
[33:00.58]Alright, lock in.
[33:09.40]I got to lock in big time right now.
[33:13.06]Don't just spam.
[33:13.86]It only takes one or two shots.
[33:14.82]Don't just hold the button down.
[33:16.14]You overheat too.
[33:20.81]It might be based on disk speed.
[33:23.93]Oh my god.
[33:26.09]Come on.
[33:55.87]Not bad so far.
[33:57.48]I think my health is in the middle left.
[34:00.56]And it seems to recharge if I don't get hit for like 5 seconds or so.
[34:03.96]Out of combat maybe?
[34:13.91]I'm only doing this to see the cutscene after.
[34:15.65]It's the only reason why I care.
[34:40.70]These things are such a pain in the ass to deal with.
[34:56.45]It's quiet.
[34:57.79]Too quiet.
[35:08.77]God, this thing is so fucking impossible to hit.
[35:21.30]Good.
[35:21.90]Needed that bad.
[35:22.62]I needed that to happen exactly how it just did.
[35:26.08]Gotta be getting close.
[35:51.85]Good?
[35:52.27]Come on.
[35:56.21]Holy shit.
[35:59.53]This is the finale.
[36:08.58]I can't even go that way.
[36:14.32]You've got to be kidding me.
[36:15.24]I couldn't even go that far.
[36:29.90]That's gotta be the finale.
[36:33.44]Oh my god, dude.
[36:40.47]Fucking get rid of mine!
[36:58.77]God, I did it.
[36:59.43]Alright, let's go.
[37:03.26]That was amazing.
[37:05.64]Kiss me.
[37:12.98]What?
[37:13.60]What if I, I, I, okay.
[37:15.74]I have a choice here.
[37:16.54]I get.
[37:16.82]Uh-oh.
[37:29.65]And this guy has a problem with this?
[37:32.75]Get him.
[37:36.49]I... Who are these people?
[37:38.89]Do I work here?
[37:39.67]No, he's still out.
[37:43.02]Search the hovercraft and see what you can find.
[37:45.42]And send Jia down here.
[37:48.40]Ah, you're awake.
[37:49.82]No use struggling.
[37:50.66]You're not going anywhere.
[37:52.56]Now maybe we can talk about why we were attacked.
[37:56.58]Uh...
[37:58.43]What?
[37:58.89]I... I'm so confused.
[38:02.77]Why... Okay.
[38:25.35]I don't even have a chance to process what just happened.
[38:27.47]Why was she allowed to just... Okay, I guess we have to investigate.
[38:31.16]Alright, I'm armed now.
[38:39.56]I have one bullet in this.
[38:42.95]How did I get out of this so easily?
[38:45.69]Why was the electrocute the guy button?
[38:47.81]And this is the thing that I have a problem with, okay?
[38:50.97]Listen up, game developers.
[38:52.13]We're sick of this shit.
[38:54.64]They had the electrocute the guy button as a tap.
[38:59.49]As a hold, it was release the prisoner.
[39:02.43]Do you understand how sick of this we're getting?
[39:06.75]Button context with holding or tapping and shit?
[39:09.56]Come on.
[39:10.52]And look at how easy I just got out of that because of that.
[39:13.30]It was the same device.
[39:15.10]Let the guy out versus electrocute him.
[39:20.00]I don't want to hold E to open draw and have E be a used item.
[39:24.03]I don't want to do that anymore.
[39:28.59]I'm wishing right now in real time... Wait, let me check on my friend.
[39:31.61]Do I even know who this girl is?
[39:37.83]No, no, no.
[39:38.69]I want to investigate.
[39:39.51]I'm going to turn around.
[39:40.96]I honestly can't even see.
[39:44.94]Okay, there I am.
[39:50.23]There we go.
[40:00.33]Can I not even check and see if she is okay?
[40:05.39]No, I guess I shouldn't care.
[40:13.27]Okay.
[40:18.21]Kiss me.
[40:24.31]Alright, that looks like a ladder.
[40:25.83]I'm going on the ladder.
[40:29.57]No, I'm not.
[40:35.11]Looks like I'm going in the door.
[40:36.86]I'm going through that door.
[40:40.20]I'm not going in that door.
[40:41.58]That's probably the wrong way to go.
[40:42.48]I'm going to go.
[40:44.10]I'm going to go that way.
[40:49.00]Yeah.
[40:52.91]Yeah, that was the wrong way to go anyways.
[40:54.35]OK.
[41:00.97]We're going to this way.
[41:01.69]That's the way I wanted to go.
[41:03.82]Yeah.
[41:06.34]OK, we're going to go up.
[41:09.36]And.
[41:09.56]I guess I'm going over here.
[41:14.44]This is turning into a maze and I don't like it.
[41:21.93]Gaming used to be good.
[41:25.13]It still is.
[41:32.22]It is loading something.
[41:36.69]We went to first person mode.
[41:49.76]Abnormal active thermal scan causing interference with cryonic stasis matrix.
[41:57.24]Device will detonate at 100% threshold.
[41:59.46]Is that at 95?
[42:01.08]It's at 96%?
[42:01.30]Detonators will reach threshold in six seconds!
[42:15.95]What am I supposed to do about this?
[42:17.45]How do I get out of here?
[42:18.15]I have six seconds to get out?
[42:28.52]I don't understand what just happened.
[42:32.06]I want to see what happens if you walk away from this.
[42:41.89]No, I don't think so.
[42:49.35]I think I get to... I don't think I get captured, do I?
[42:51.79]Are you serious?
[42:54.86]A game with actual choices that mattered?
[42:56.22]If you kiss that girl, it's harder.
[42:57.32]Wait, what?
[43:20.60]Okay, well, let's see what happens if I do it the other way.
[43:24.44]Go back to the hangar.
[43:35.51]No, no, no, turn around, turn... Wait, actually, it was this way, wasn't it?
[43:46.20]Yeah, it's out this way.
[43:54.40]This one was a good one to start with.
[43:55.78]This one's great.
[43:58.72]I'm very impressed.
[43:59.58]This one was a banger.
[44:00.72]This was fantastic.
[44:01.90]What a good one to start with.
[44:10.17]Where did he say to go?
[44:16.06]Back to the hangar, right?
[44:36.27]Do I just... How do I progress the game from here?
[44:43.74]Nah, nah, I know.
[44:45.04]I feel this, though.
[44:46.02]I feel this.
[44:46.30]Like, we just don't know where you're going.
[44:48.24]Like, oh yeah, come back to this part of the office.
[44:51.12]And it's like, I don't know where the fuck that is.
[44:54.77]Then you walk in circles for like five minutes until you find someone that you pretend that you're just barely not looking.
[45:03.61]You cross paths in the office with somebody.
[45:06.59]And it's like, oh, hey, oh, hey, hey.
[45:09.71]What's that secondary office?
[45:11.73]I just got up five seconds ago and I'm passing you.
[45:16.49]I have not been walking around in circles for five minutes.
[45:20.83]Hey, yeah, I just popped out for a second.
[45:23.11]It's down here, right?
[45:24.07]And you kind of guess.
[45:25.57]You guess.
[45:27.33]And if you get it right, then you know what you were doing.
[45:30.02]If you get it wrong, okay, there's a 50-50 chance that you got it right.
[45:34.44]And it makes you kind of look like you already knew what you were doing.
[45:39.94]Like, oh, that second office, that's down here, right?
[45:43.14]That's a wild guess.
[45:44.72]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, it's right there.
[45:45.98]You knew that.
[45:46.40]Yeah, I know.
[45:47.00]I just was checking and making sure I know where I'm going.
[45:51.15]How do you open a door?
[45:51.71]I don't know how to open a door.
[45:57.95]Why do you tie yourself in falsehoods?
[46:05.06]I don't know.
[46:05.84]I'm just fucking trying to live, man.
[46:11.18]This way?
[46:11.52]That's such relatable office humor.
[46:21.72]Alright, I'm back in the hangar.
[46:22.82]I think we did it.
[46:28.56]I found the spot I need to be in.
[46:35.80]I think this is it, right?
[46:36.72]Just leave?
[46:38.58]That's a day's work.
[46:40.92]Get to the hangar and get out of here.
[46:42.24]Go home.
[46:45.26]Do I just watch Minecraft speedruns at home now?
[46:47.82]Like, that's what I do.
[46:48.66]Like, I mean, is that what I do now?
[46:50.82]When I go home?
[46:54.72]How do I leave?
[46:55.20]Do I just go back and watch, like, the classic hardcore WoW streams?
[47:02.21]Like, popping around to everybody and just watching?
[47:03.89]That's what I'm doing.
[47:05.75]It's so lovely, by the way.
[47:07.31]Let me just tell you.
[47:08.94]I've been watching the Only Fangs stuff.
[47:15.20]I can't get enough of it.
[47:16.04]I love it.
[47:24.34]Only Fangs.
[47:25.92]F-A-N-G-S.
[47:27.42]It's the guild name.
[47:28.34]It's the... Just go look it up.
[47:31.04]Add a G, though.
[47:35.74]Dude, I can't get enough of this stuff.
[47:37.90]I just found this the other day.
[47:39.04]Whoa!
[47:40.22]Are you kidding me?
[47:41.32]There's so much of this.
[47:45.54]Guys, I've been bouncing around.
[47:46.66]There's been a ton of different places.
[47:48.57]I'm watching this person, this person, this... Oh, it's so great.
[47:51.65]There's so many places to go on Only Fangs.
[48:01.57]Is this supposed to be a Christian stream?
[48:07.22]Hey.
[48:15.86]I've been enjoying a Poke T1.
[48:18.84]Oh, it's been so funny.
[48:21.12]It's been so fun.
[48:23.25]There's nothing better than watching somebody play World of Warcraft that like kind of is just like brand new.
[48:30.37]And they're in hardcore and there's like so much shit going on.
[48:33.45]It's so much so entertaining.
[48:34.65]It just is.
[48:35.01]I don't know how to leave.
[48:39.65]He told me to leave and I can't leave.
[48:57.28]He said, go back to the hangar and I can't get out of here.
[49:01.89]He means leave the game.
[49:07.01]Yeah, Doug Doug's been playing it.
[49:08.59]A ton of people have been playing it.
[49:09.55]And they have this add-on where it says when somebody dies on everybody's screen.
[49:16.42]It's really just, I feel like it's just cool.
[49:20.28]I'm an enjoyer.
[49:26.21]I can't go back in here.
[49:31.89]Okay.
[49:32.45]Did anybody listen to what he said to do?
[49:33.63]Because I don't know.
[49:38.15]I don't know what to do.
[49:40.75]I don't want to give up on this one just yet, though, because this is wonderful.
[49:48.10]He said, go back to the hangar.
[49:49.36]Isn't this the hangar?
[49:54.40]He didn't give me any more instructions after this.
[50:04.20]Back to your ship.
[50:04.96]Isn't this my ship right here?
[50:05.86]I just did and it didn't do anything.
[50:31.63]Okay.
[50:32.39]I'm at my ship right now.
[50:33.77]This is my ship right here.
[50:35.68]How do I, like, use it?
[50:44.50]It turns me around.
[50:45.33]It doesn't want me to do this.
[50:49.13]Yeah, it's like, no, no, no.
[50:50.45]You're going the wrong way.
[50:51.65]Shit.
[50:52.51]Okay.
[50:52.99]I think I might move on.
[51:02.55]You just fuse with it.
[51:08.30]A hangar is for aircraft.
[51:11.38]Where the hell is that?
[51:14.10]I'm going to give this five more minutes and then I'm moving on to... I'm so excited to play this next one.
[51:18.99]You have no idea.
[51:19.77]If you thought this one was crazy, just wait till the next one.
[51:23.31]I can't wait to play it.
[51:24.35]It's going to be my favorite game ever.
[51:34.69]We need to see what happens.
[51:40.21]No, what are you doing?
[51:41.23]Turn around.
[51:48.21]Go in the door.
[51:51.51]The next game.
[51:52.23]Oh, you have no idea what I've got planned for you today.
[51:58.49]I'm telling you, this is some big deal ones coming up here.
[52:06.54]Maybe... Oh, I never went left.
[52:08.56]Did I?
[52:09.32]No, I never went this way.
[52:10.18]I don't think I can go in here.
[52:17.79]Alright, left or right?
[52:18.39]Which way?
[52:18.89]I'm going to let you decide so you don't get mad at me.
[52:28.65]I've seen a lot of lefts.
[52:38.03]I don't think this is right.
[52:43.16]He's just standing here.
[52:48.68]Yeah, this is not.
[52:49.38]This is not correct.
[52:50.80]He won't go in the door.
[52:51.52]Did you candles gonna go out?
[52:58.29]Is the other way is just the gun, right?
[53:07.86]I can't go in any of these doors.
[53:16.51]Is there certain button I have to press?
[53:17.71]I'm pressing everything.
[53:26.85]Doesn't feel like there's an interact button.
[53:28.24]I pressed everything.
[53:34.26]Okay.
[53:35.28]Well, this one was really fun.
[53:37.00]It was very funny.
[53:42.38]But I think I'm going to have to move on because I can't figure it out and it's a 45,000 year old game.
[53:52.83]Is there a manual?
[53:53.53]Probably, but I don't have it.
[53:56.18]Okay, we'll move on.
[53:58.06]That was a great one, though.
[53:59.02]That was really fun.
[53:59.60]That probably could have gotten even more interesting.
[54:01.51]I might have to go back to this one at some point after I look up how to do it.
[54:04.19]Alright, next one.
[54:07.93]I'm looking forward to it big time.
[54:15.07]This next one is called... You know what?
[54:19.97]I don't even want to tell you.
[54:21.87]You're all going to hate this one, but I don't care.
[54:23.30]I'm going to like this one.
[54:26.82]This one's called... No.
[54:28.04]Don't even tell them.
[54:37.76]Don't even... Let them find out.
[54:38.84]This is... This is quarterback attack.
[54:49.10]This game is all FMV.
[54:51.82]The whole thing.
[54:57.24]This is a completely full motion video sports game.
[55:02.28]I am so excited you have no idea.
[55:03.78]Okay.
[55:15.55]Quarterback attack with Mike Detka.
[55:17.11]Okay, Rook.
[55:20.01]Today you get your shot.
[55:21.23]Never hears that with a busted shoulder.
[55:23.91]Welcome to the jungle, kid.
[55:27.67]Oh, it's me.
[55:28.19]I'm the new player.
[55:29.31]These guys are all my favorite athletes.
[55:32.88]I love how fast I'm whipping my neck around.
[55:34.28]Hey, that's our star player.
[55:35.52]You're going to fucking put him on the DL.
[56:05.61]I feel like a dog.
[56:06.89]This is a dog POV.
[56:09.07]The way that my head's whipping around.
[56:10.19]And it's like looking at people and like sniffing stuff.
[56:15.07]What did he do that for?
[56:20.22]By the way, one take.
[56:21.80]One take, Jake, by the way.
[56:23.70]Actually impressive.
[56:25.12]One take this whole thing was.
[56:32.61]Hey, coach, you sure you want to let the dog do this?
[56:42.50]Of course I want the dog to do it.
[56:43.78]You have to understand, this is a movie that was made between 1980 and 1997.
[56:48.56]Of course the fucking dog is going to play, you asshole.
[56:51.34]I'm going to throw this fucking stool.
[57:00.51]Okay.
[57:01.57]Skill level.
[57:03.86]I'm going to say not that high.
[57:05.62]Oh, OK, that's fine.
[57:06.84]Skill level, we're going to go with... Where's dog?
[57:11.86]Junior?
[57:13.16]We're going to stay junior varsity.
[57:15.46]This is going to be impossible.
[57:22.23]Game length, an hour?
[57:24.99]Can you actually have a 16 minute football game?
[57:31.74]No, we're going to do 60 minutes.
[57:33.52]It's going to be 60 video game minutes, guys.
[57:35.44]Don't you understand?
[57:35.98]60 video game minutes is like 10 minutes in real life.
[57:40.22]It's reverse dog years, so it's fine.
[57:43.86]Okay, what about options?
[57:47.19]Delete the game.
[57:50.55]Controller.
[57:51.29]Okay, here we go.
[57:53.30]So this is scramble, aim, pass, dodge, passing views, throw, okay, throw, pass, and snap balls are.
[58:03.07]That's very important to know.
[58:06.93]After snap is, okay, does any of this matter?
[58:12.10]Let's go.
[58:12.48]Time to kick off.
[58:20.18]What team am I on?
[58:24.33]that's us alright nice how how far is that alright what I'm gonna do uh I'm gonna do a pass play what if I just punt the ball alright pass and we're gonna do mailbox b go
[59:03.60]How many yards?
[59:04.18]Okay, I lost seven yards.
[59:05.80]I lost seven yards.
[59:06.70]I don't know how to pass.
[59:08.74]Pass.
[59:09.32]Okay, we're going to go for the far right.
[59:11.14]We're going to go A. Far right, yellow.
[59:18.10]Here we go.
[59:18.52]Alright.
[59:24.86]Throw it.
[59:25.26]Pass it.
[59:25.56]Pass it.
[59:26.70]Pass it.
[59:27.02]Pass it.
[59:31.79]Shit, I just threw it for the fucking like... I just threw it for like 400 yards.
[59:37.13]How much... The only thing missing there was the Nerf whistle sound.
[59:45.31]The like... Alright, wait, fuck it.
[59:48.23]The game doesn't even... I don't think the game even understands that you can get tackled.
[59:52.25]We're gonna throw it as far as I fucking can again.
[59:56.24]I'm just throwing a bomb pass again.
[59:58.28]We're gonna go 50 yards.
[60:03.86]Alright, which way?
[60:04.50]Okay, here we go.
[60:07.30]No, not you.
[60:07.90]Not you.
[60:08.20]Not you.
[60:10.14]Not you.
[60:11.32]You!
[60:24.59]Oh, okay.
[60:26.29]Now we're going to go for a run play.
[60:28.05]Alright, we're going to go... Look at this.
[60:29.31]I'm going to kick this guy's ass.
[60:31.62]Alright.
[60:31.88]How about toss?
[60:32.92]We're going to go toss right side.
[60:35.20]HB toss.
[60:35.90]Half back.
[60:40.10]Okay.
[60:40.55]Looking good.
[60:41.07]Looking good.
[60:47.19]I don't think I had any control over that.
[60:48.41]I think it's just random.
[60:50.95]Where am I?
[60:51.33]Alright.
[60:51.57]I'm at second and goal.
[60:54.15]Let's run another run play.
[60:55.13]Alright.
[60:57.28]We're going to do HB draw B. We're going to try to cut through the middle here.
[61:04.24]Who would tackle a dog?
[61:06.48]I love the face mask.
[61:09.14]It's so funny.
[61:12.06]It looks like I'm standing over a balcony.
[61:13.77]I gotta hike it.
[61:17.27]Good.
[61:19.01]He got in!
[61:19.35]He got in!
[61:19.67]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[61:24.07]Was that first down?
[61:24.97]Alright, third and goal.
[61:25.65]Third and goal.
[61:26.27]We'll go in for a pass play.
[61:28.54]I'm going for yellow here.
[61:29.44]Stepladder.
[61:30.68]See that crossover?
[61:35.62]Stepladder.
[61:36.08]We're going to go crossover.
[61:37.46]For a touchdown.
[61:37.96]Otherwise, I'm going to have to kick a field goal.
[61:44.86]Here we go.
[61:48.17]Come on.
[61:48.57]Got it.
[61:53.65]That's a fucking touchdown!
[61:58.59]Why is there a chicken mascot?
[62:02.45]Alright.
[62:02.81]It would be funny if that was me.
[62:05.14]Alright, press A to kick for one point.
[62:06.48]Yeah, we're going to go one point.
[62:09.99]How do you kick?
[62:10.97]It just does it automatically.
[62:16.65]Okay, they don't even want to give you any attempt to do this.
[62:25.66]Okay, so now I'm on defense.
[62:28.13]How does this work?
[62:34.91]Stop him.
[62:40.37]Okay, so this is me.
[62:41.41]Nope.
[62:42.43]He just punted it.
[62:45.21]What just happened?
[62:46.13]Why would you punt on the... Okay.
[62:52.70]But the question is, why did he punt the ball?
[62:55.60]Immediately after getting hit.
[62:56.78]Alright, fuck that.
[63:00.10]I'll kick a field goal from fucking 100 yards away.
[63:12.74]He almost made it.
[63:15.70]That was like a 110-yard field goal.
[63:19.05]And he can sign that guy for life.
[63:21.41]Sign that guy for the rest of his life.
[63:23.13]That guy could be 100 years old and still sign him.
[63:32.09]Oh, it just... Okay.
[63:37.25]I get it.
[63:37.73]I get it.
[63:38.15]So it just simulates what they did on the other side.
[63:41.60]I get it.
[63:44.38]OK.
[63:45.28]Frank you.
[63:46.50]OK, we're going to pass and again we're just doing is there just Hail Mary?
[63:58.67]Mailbox.
[64:00.31]I'm going to try to throw it over 100 yards.
[64:08.90]I'm gonna bury you.
[64:09.80]Okay.
[64:11.98]Looking for the backfield.
[64:13.52]Nope.
[64:14.85]Nope.
[64:16.17]Yep.
[64:23.45]There it is.
[64:23.87]Okay.
[64:25.25]Let's go.
[64:25.73]Keep going.
[64:27.85]Running play.
[64:30.50]Uh... HB sweep.
[64:33.56]C. C.
[64:46.40]Can anybody go off sides?
[64:47.58]Are there any other penalties?
[64:49.64]Oh!
[65:05.71]I love the POV when you throw to people.
[65:07.97]Because it really does feel like it's one of those GoPro working at a restaurant videos.
[65:13.07]That's what it looks like.
[65:14.75]It's got that same feel.
[65:15.97]I want to see more of that.
[65:16.89]Alright, how about hook... How about 64 in car?
[65:27.28]I'm liking that, the green.
[65:28.64]See the green X going left and then up?
[65:30.70]Let's go with that.
[65:38.17]Good.
[65:38.67]Alright, go.
[65:44.69]What the hell am I doing?
[65:45.39]Shit.
[65:51.22]I wanted to scramble as the quarterback.
[65:52.92]Alright, we're going step ladder again.
[65:55.18]It always works.
[65:55.66]Alright, hike it.
[66:02.22]Get him off guard.
[66:14.23]It's great because I threw it in one direction and the camera cut broke the rule of, uh, what is it called?
[66:20.95]You don't cross the line.
[66:22.49]So it looks like the ball, it looks like I threw it the other way into my own end zone.
[66:27.78]Alright.
[66:28.02]This is fourth and 10.
[66:28.86]I got to get this.
[66:30.02]That's the one.
[66:43.44]Yep.
[66:43.64]Alright, that's gotta be first down.
[66:45.10]Come on.
[66:50.44]Holy shit.
[66:53.88]Okay.
[66:55.34]Let's do a running play.
[66:58.44]Off tackle.
[67:02.45]This really just is a football choose-your-own-adventure game, it seems like.
[67:06.67]I'm all for it.
[67:07.55]I love it.
[67:12.73]Oh, shit.
[67:13.39]Got stuffed.
[67:20.56]Go right for the end zone.
[67:23.52]Ooh, here we go.
[67:24.24]Where's, uh, where's, like, okay, all deep.
[67:27.60]Triple post.
[67:28.80]No, we're doing x-ray.
[67:31.14]I'm getting a touchdown right now.
[67:34.70]This game is making me motion sick.
[67:37.93]Uh, that is the least surprising thing I think I've heard all day, honestly.
[67:43.29]Uh, yeah, let's uh.
[67:49.18]Get it.
[67:56.69]So it looks like field goal is just random.
[68:00.07]Just a coin toss.
[68:05.83]Keep throwing passes.
[68:06.67]I'll do triple post again deep.
[68:11.70]Need to play this in VR.
[68:13.54]One of the most surprising things I think that came from VR is there was not any football games or baseball games.
[68:20.37]I would love a football game in VR.
[68:22.19]It'd be amazing.
[68:22.85]Although it would probably make me throw up.
[68:31.66]Baseball, I feel like nobody did it.
[68:33.44]Alright, we're going to run it in for a touchdown right here.
[68:37.02]HB sweep.
[68:42.49]It keeps cutting to the same opposite defender.
[68:45.35]He keeps pointing at us.
[68:48.25]Let's see.
[68:48.59]Let's see if we'll do it.
[68:50.31]It's the same cut every time.
[68:59.80]Oh!
[69:02.92]Second and five.
[69:03.70]Do it again.
[69:04.02]We're going to do something goofy.
[69:09.44]FB trap.
[69:14.78]Go.
[69:19.06]Why are you cheering for that?
[69:20.56]We just got destroyed.
[69:21.38]Okay.
[69:24.93]Pass.
[69:26.65]Let's go short plays here.
[69:27.93]We're going to do alright.
[69:32.09]Everybody just goes to the right.
[69:33.01]This is going to be a touchdown right here.
[69:47.11]Throw it.
[69:49.53]What?
[69:49.89]No, I. Got it.
[69:55.57]That's touchdown.
[70:00.65]The turkey is so excited about this.
[70:05.08]Am I crazy or is that a is that really a pretty cheap looking costume?
[70:11.50]Usually Matt that there ain't no foam in that.
[70:14.76]There ain't no foam in that.
[70:19.55]Uh, what if I just do pass?
[70:21.41]Is it just random?
[70:22.95]Okay, I'm going to pass for a two-point conversion.
[70:33.95]I have to get this.
[70:34.59]This is a must.
[70:35.89]Must win.
[70:36.41]Oh, fuck.
[70:42.71]Why did it cut to the other guy?
[70:45.40]That was a jump scare.
[70:46.60]That was a Five Nights at Freddy's.
[70:47.78]Like, Chica just jumped in front of us.
[70:50.12]Alright, nothing.
[71:02.36]Nothing.
[71:04.08]Good.
[71:04.36]Punt.
[71:04.66]Okay.
[71:08.85]Good run back.
[71:09.39]Come on.
[71:19.56]Okay, for a second, I thought he had a weapon.
[71:22.76]I was like, they're going to introduce a weapon now?
[71:25.14]That was like, this guy's got a weapon in his hands.
[71:28.18]But that's not where they went.
[71:30.59]Are there 56 minutes left in the game?
[71:33.85]Have I only played for four minutes?
[71:37.67]What?
[71:38.99]What are you talking about?
[71:46.49]This game's gonna go into the hundreds of points.
[71:55.95]Shit.
[71:59.01]Wait, 54?
[71:59.37]I'm confused.
[72:01.70]That's seconds.
[72:02.28]Alright, what is the actual game clock?
[72:06.44]I didn't even mean to press that, but I just kicked another field goal.
[72:20.20]It's alright, coach.
[72:20.92]Coach, that was a good play.
[72:22.12]Coach, that was a good idea.
[72:24.93]Oh, shit.
[72:25.25]It's okay.
[72:25.73]It doesn't matter.
[72:30.45]Where is the game clock?
[72:32.23]How much time is left in the game?
[72:34.45]We're just trapped here forever as players.
[72:38.13]Where's the game clock?
[72:43.30]The crowd is cardboard cutouts.
[72:47.55]Okay, there are 13 minutes left in the whole game?
[72:49.91]Second quarter.
[72:50.55]No, okay, wait, right.
[72:52.11]Oh man, we're only in the second quarter.
[72:58.25]Is it actually real time?
[72:59.95]Did I have it wrong?
[73:01.29]I think it actually might be real time.
[73:04.40]It is.
[73:06.40]Because I thought it was going to be video game seconds.
[73:10.86]It actually is a full hour in the game.
[73:17.95]He's open.
[73:18.63]That's gonna be it.
[73:20.35]Good.
[73:20.69]Okay, we're good.
[73:25.33]Oh, let's do a running play?
[73:26.39]This is gonna take forever.
[73:31.30]Oh, you need to commit to the bit here?
[73:34.36]I mean, I have a better idea.
[73:35.42]It's called quit the game.
[73:37.32]Go make it 16 minutes and go play it.
[73:39.62]Because we need to see the ending cutscenes, right?
[73:45.62]That's a good run.
[73:47.43]Wow!
[73:48.89]Wow, he's just going!
[74:00.28]Wait, can I...
[74:11.09]Just quit at halftime.
[74:12.85]Yeah.
[74:13.01]Okay.
[74:13.17]We're going to get it.
[74:13.93]Okay.
[74:14.49]No, I gotta, I gotta get out of here.
[74:17.09]I have to get out of here.
[74:18.63]Delete game.
[74:22.16]I'm not, I'm not playing this.
[74:24.00]Gex videos.
[74:28.74]Oh, this is like the, this is what's on the device from all the other times I've played this.
[74:32.71]That's funny.
[74:34.95]No, don't delete anything.
[74:41.75]I don't think I can leave.
[74:43.27]Well, I can call timeouts.
[74:49.20]It is internal storage.
[74:53.34]Alright, I'll get to halftime and then.
[75:01.08]I could just reset.
[75:01.88]I'm going to reset.
[75:02.78]I don't.
[75:03.22]I'm going to reset.
[75:03.82]This is going to take so long.
[75:22.41]You need to commit.
[75:23.11]Do I commit?
[75:26.57]No, I'm not committing.
[75:29.31]Alright, I'm going to reset.
[75:30.23]I'm going to reset.
[75:31.49]I want to do the 15 minute option.
[75:34.62]No, I'm getting halftime.
[75:35.42]I don't care.
[75:41.56]Nope.
[75:42.70]Nope.
[75:43.26]Shit.
[75:43.88]Nope.
[75:50.64]Alright, I'm going to reset it.
[76:03.58]I want to at least get to halftime.
[76:05.12]And this is, I'll do the 16 minute one.
[76:06.92]The fast one.
[76:12.75]I love this one though.
[76:13.91]I definitely want to see it to the end at least.
[76:21.83]What is a Gex video?
[76:23.01]I don't know.
[76:25.64]It's called I Played Gex.
[76:29.58]Five years ago on stream.
[76:32.54]And it's probably the intro cutscene that needs its own save file.
[76:35.50]Okay, 16 minutes.
[76:44.15]Skill level junior.
[76:46.52]There we go.
[76:47.52]Now we're good.
[76:48.92]Now everything's gonna be fine.
[76:50.76]We're gonna blow through this.
[76:52.24]Go.
[77:04.89]Okay, yeah, that's much better.
[77:08.47]Now I have to actually take this seriously because I can't lose.
[77:10.26]Five yards.
[77:20.93]I lost a yard.
[77:23.23]Pass.
[77:24.79]Subway.
[77:30.28]Alright, so if it's on really easy, does that mean I can get a field goal from 100 yards away?
[77:34.34]That might actually be what that means.
[77:35.40]Nope.
[77:40.14]Yep.
[77:44.47]All the way.
[77:51.29]The best part about this game is it's absolutely just running a random number generator to see what happens when the ball is caught.
[78:00.78]I love it.
[78:08.06]I gotta get at least a touchdown.
[78:12.58]Right there.
[78:13.66]Wide open.
[78:16.23]That doesn't make any sense.
[78:19.37]Like I said, I swear that Madden does that too.
[78:31.35]Like old calculator football.
[78:37.01]Ooh, that was a good move.
[78:37.95]I'm throwing it to you.
[78:42.47]We're making our way up.
[78:43.15]We're fine.
[78:54.60]Run to the right side.
[78:58.20]There's a notable lack of cigarettes in this game.
[79:00.28]You mean the players smoking it or the coach smoking it?
[79:03.00]What do you mean?
[79:04.60]Or the people in the crowds smoking?
[79:12.99]Also, by the way, if there's a motivational speech halftime minigame, this is going up as one of my favorite games ever made.
[79:21.96]It deserves to be there.
[79:26.26]You know what's funny about FMV is everybody thought back in the day that this was what we all were going to get eventually is real life that you control.
[79:37.17]You're not going to be able to tell the difference.
[79:40.63]It's real.
[79:41.39]Look at how realistic and real life everything is to the point where people were recording real life videos and stringing them together to kind of simulate that.
[79:52.61]It's actually interesting that FMV really did sort of die off big time because I feel like with the technology now, there could be some multi, you know, you talk about like a hundred million dollar projects.
[80:06.16]We saw some interactive movies.
[80:08.36]I'm surprised that interactive movies didn't come back.
[80:10.76]Big time.
[80:11.42]I mean, we saw obviously the Bandersnatch, whatever it is, on Netflix.
[80:16.13]But in the theater, I mean.
[80:18.63]And they've done this once or twice before.
[80:20.67]Imagine in the theater if the audience got to participate and vote on what happens in the movie in real time.
[80:29.28]That would be so cool.
[80:31.12]And I believe that they actually have done this once or twice before.
[80:35.32]They did it and it sucked.
[80:41.54]Says you.
[80:43.48]That guy... I don't know how I passed it.
[80:48.40]He hit me before I threw it.
[81:00.92]Yeah, and I've played some of the new FMV games.
[81:07.06]You know what an FMV game that came out recently?
[81:09.50]That was awesome.
[81:11.34]It was so weird and so fucking terrifying.
[81:14.38]Immortality.
[81:16.46]I know I've already talked about it.
[81:17.36]I put it on my game of the year's list a year or two ago.
[81:20.34]That was wonderful.
[81:22.28]It was such a weird experience.
[81:24.84]The story was like, eh, it was a kind of hit or miss.
[81:27.22]But the actual kind of tech and the actual kind of how they told the story was one of the most interesting things I think I've done.
[81:35.03]It was awesome.
[81:37.26]There are a few moments in that where you're kind of just doing it and you're like, what?
[81:40.12]Wait.
[81:41.33]What the hell is going on?
[81:42.37]Nobody open.
[81:51.45]Come on.
[81:58.55]What is it?
[81:59.17]Fourth and ten?
[81:59.87]Field goal from 95 yards away.
[82:19.78]But FMV games what I would like to see more of is not just this is a one and a half hour long movie and there are five points that can happen, right?
[82:34.37]There are five different branching movies that you can see.
[82:38.49]I would love to see so many more little paths to go down.
[82:42.33]Little like dead ends that end the story.
[82:45.23]Think of sorcery, right?
[82:46.79]Choose your own adventure.
[82:49.45]I want situations where, and not just like one or two throughout the whole experience.
[82:53.29]I want like 25 different times where you go down the wrong path in like it's a six minute, seven minute part of the experience or like 10 minutes in and you have to start over.
[83:01.88]You fucked up.
[83:02.34]Alright, halftime coming up here.
[83:07.72]It feels like a lot of the storyline games and storyline kind of interactive movies, they give these like one or two branching points and like six real things that can actually kind of happen.
[83:17.90]I mean, that costs a lot of money, obviously, to record.
[83:22.82]Instead of, well, over 125.
[83:23.70]He's still got it.
[83:24.13]They like me.
[83:24.69]What?
[83:36.19]Oh, shit.
[83:37.96]I didn't even get a touchdown.
[83:39.90]I didn't get it.
[83:40.64]That guy was so nice to me and he didn't realize that I fucked up so bad.
[83:48.02]We're not going to get possession.
[83:49.00]Why is everybody having... No, we're losing down by 10.
[83:54.76]And I just fucked up so bad.
[83:57.57]Trust me.
[83:59.67]We start playing like I know we can.
[84:01.51]We'll come back.
[84:02.61]I'll bet my job on it.
[84:04.68]Let's take a look at these numbers.
[84:06.20]Don't do that.
[84:06.61]Completing less than 50%.
[84:08.49]You can do better than that.
[84:09.81]And you got a whole half to prove it.
[84:12.01]No interceptions.
[84:12.97]Squeaky clean.
[84:14.03]I like that.
[84:15.23]You've been staying away from the rush.
[84:16.77]Keep dancing around.
[84:17.91]Don't let those guys get their hands on you.
[84:19.90]Man, I know we got a rookie.
[84:21.94]This kid's really got the stuff.
[84:23.92]So it's up to the rest of us to get behind him.
[84:26.62]So we gonna do it?
[84:27.56]Yeah!
[84:28.78]We gonna do it?
[84:34.16]I thought he was going to punch the guy next to him.
[84:38.39]One at a time!
[84:39.11]One at a time!
[84:39.65]Someone's going to get hurt!
[84:40.83]One at a time!
[84:41.51]Hey, all the smart people went out the left door.
[84:47.53]Do you see that?
[84:48.35]That's sociology in a nutshell.
[84:50.65]This is society right there.
[84:52.77]Look at the people that went out the left door.
[84:56.93]Everyone rushed out to the... No, see the people that went out the left door?
[85:03.73]Hey, no interceptors.
[85:04.81]That's good.
[85:06.71]Bumble.
[85:08.67]I know I have to win.
[85:09.27]I have to make the coach happy.
[85:11.77]I wonder what happens if... Okay.
[85:14.17]I know I don't want to... Stop him, please?
[85:16.09]Holy shit, that was insane.
[85:20.84]Uh, what does he say if you... What does he say if you only kick field goals and miss them?
[85:30.38]Alright, so what happened was there were no interceptions.
[85:32.94]And what happened is you didn't score very many points.
[85:35.52]And what happened was there was only field goals that you missed.
[85:47.29]We're going to give it to the rookie to maybe not make the calls to only do field goals.
[85:59.65]What the fuck just happened?
[86:11.84]I was running like I was on a Sunday jog.
[86:14.18]I was not even trying to.
[86:17.00]Hold on, can I do that again?
[86:33.95]Am I alright?
[86:35.37]I just got a first down.
[86:36.43]Why don't I just do that every time?
[86:41.39]Why does everybody sound like an orc?
[86:50.97]They're like fucking monsters.
[87:01.67]At what point is this not gonna work?
[87:07.01]I just got seven yards.
[87:08.27]Why would I do anything else?
[87:16.19]You have a safe fall on you?
[87:17.61]Nice.
[87:34.39]Okay, touchdown.
[87:35.13]This is where we come back.
[87:36.47]Check this out.
[87:47.12]Go, go, go, go.
[87:47.80]Come on.
[87:53.80]Touchdown.
[87:54.48]Alright, seven.
[87:55.14]That's seven.
[87:56.54]I have to get a field goal to win this game eventually here.
[87:58.60]I gotta stop him here.
[88:01.32]What if we go to overtime?
[88:07.98]No, just get the two points and try to tie the game.
[88:15.46]Alright, stop him.
[88:22.26]What did he say?
[88:25.96]Alright, even Mike Dipka is watching the classic hardcore OnlyFans.
[88:40.77]Nice.
[88:41.37]Best thing that possibly could have happened is what happened right there.
[88:48.91]That was absolutely massive.
[88:50.85]Okay.
[88:51.85]Run out the clock here.
[88:52.89]I got an entire possession.
[88:54.03]I can win the game right here.
[88:59.13]No interceptions.
[89:00.67]Easy passes and maybe some QB sneaks.
[89:07.38]Nice.
[89:19.42]I got completely missed.
[89:27.14]That's how I play Madden, by the way.
[89:28.88]Alright, I don't want to take a timeout, but whatever, we have 35 seconds.
[89:35.06]I always just cycle through.
[89:36.74]I press the, you know, whatever, A to select the next guy.
[89:40.05]So it's like, highlight this person.
[89:42.47]You know, the highlight that goes under their legs when you highlight a new player on defense.
[89:45.85]And then whatever the diving tackle button is.
[89:49.10]is I do cycle dive, cycle dive, cycle dive, cycle dive, and I just try to fucking hurt everybody on the team.
[89:59.27]That's what that guy just did.
[90:04.19]Somebody said that's how I play FIFA games.
[90:05.73]Yeah, I end up playing FIFA games and I end up with like too many red cards and the game has to be stopped.
[90:18.89]Alright, I can't screw this up.
[90:21.25]Passing play.
[90:23.19]Cross.
[90:23.83]Go.
[90:25.51]I want to do that QB sneak thing again, but I can't seem to do it anymore.
[90:36.70]No, come on.
[90:37.22]Somebody be open.
[90:37.90]Open!
[90:40.54]Yes!
[90:44.78]Third and nine.
[90:45.64]Uh-oh.
[90:54.46]You sound like a cabinet full of household utilities getting smashed into every time you get tackled.
[90:59.14]Wait, hold on.
[91:01.84]Hold on a sec.
[91:07.66]I need to get this.
[91:18.72]I got a first down.
[91:19.67]Why is that guy so happy about that?
[91:26.15]Alright, big plays right here.
[91:34.35]Sneak it in.
[91:36.40]Sneak it in.
[91:36.80]Come on.
[91:37.12]Sneak it in.
[91:46.65]Second and five.
[91:47.41]We're good.
[91:48.03]It's okay.
[91:48.55]Second and five.
[91:49.09]Do it again.
[91:56.94]Come on, this is for the game.
[92:05.04]Come on, I'm trying to fucking run!
[92:06.74]Alright, pass into the end zone, touchdown.
[92:11.47]Here we go, this is it.
[92:22.15]That guy's wide open!
[92:23.29]Touchdown!
[92:27.29]How's that not a touchdown?
[92:30.69]Oh, they called a timeout.
[92:31.73]Okay, first and goal.
[92:32.61]Let's go.
[92:32.97]Run it in.
[92:34.73]HB off tackle.
[92:36.77]This is for the game.
[92:40.59]Left for dead witch dive?
[92:42.53]Like Hunter?
[92:49.28]Sneak in there.
[92:51.92]Alright, second and goal.
[92:52.72]Again, we're right there.
[92:54.36]Short pass.
[92:58.88]Alright, we're gonna go hook in the game.
[93:04.95]It's a DOOM shotgun noise whenever I get hit?
[93:07.37]I'm going for it.
[93:17.76]Alright, it's not over yet.
[93:24.03]He has possession.
[93:31.10]I'm going to make sure he can't win it with a field goal.
[93:34.08]He has to get a touchdown.
[93:35.42]Unless they block this some insane way.
[93:37.10]Okay, we're good.
[93:42.33]I win the game unless he gets a touchdown.
[93:52.15]Come on, nothing.
[93:53.45]It's all RNG, but come on, nothing.
[93:56.41]Punt it.
[93:58.41]Punt it and then run the clock out.
[94:06.64]Stop him.
[94:07.80]Stop him.
[94:08.26]We won.
[94:12.48]Who's that guy?
[94:13.56]Oh my god.
[94:15.90]Why is he so mad at us?
[94:18.70]He's furious with us.
[94:36.11]To me, this is the U lost screen.
[94:38.05]This is not the U1 screen.
[94:39.57]He's very, very bad at us.
[94:46.32]Oh, nice.
[94:46.88]Okay, completions.
[94:47.76]That's not bad.
[94:51.70]Six scrambles.
[94:52.94]Two sacks.
[94:53.74]My QB rating, 125.8.
[94:54.71]That sounds pretty good.
[94:59.87]Please put your name in.
[95:00.91]Okay.
[95:01.05]Okay.
[95:06.31]OK.
[95:10.47]Hey, we got to see the credits.
[95:15.38]That was lovely.
[95:18.94]If you think about back in the day of this.
[95:21.16]It just was so current.
[95:22.98]It's so relevant and.
[95:26.19]It's great because you can tell when people are kind of having fun like everybody.
[95:28.87]They were just having a fun time.
[95:30.03]It's just that was that was wonderful.
[95:33.56]And honestly, the acting from Mike Ditka, that's pretty damn good.
[95:38.38]That anger throw in the... That throw in the... Oh, that was fucking pretty great stuff.
[95:46.62]The mascot.
[95:55.17]That was a good ending.
[95:55.89]Now it's time for the bad ending.
[95:58.33]Oh, what do you mean if we lose?
[96:11.77]Play Phantasmagoria.
[96:12.89]I already did.
[96:15.06]What?
[96:15.84]It's been a while.
[96:16.56]It's been, what, four or five years?
[96:18.88]I have played it before.
[96:19.74]I think I played the sequel as well.
[96:21.28]Alright.
[96:23.50]Well, we're going to move on.
[96:24.30]I'm going to take a quick break.
[96:25.06]I'm going to go pee.
[96:25.48]I'm going to refill my drink.
[96:29.32]And we'll come back with... It could be another great one.
[96:32.32]We'll see.
[96:33.36]I'll be right back.
[97:09.33]OK, Rook, today you get your shot.
[97:19.57]Nebbitt here is out with a busted shoulder.
[97:22.21]Welcome to the jungle, kid.
[97:27.65]Brick a leg, kid.
[97:31.19]Listen, kid, remember to read those defenses carefully.
[97:33.83]We want to rack up a lot of points today.
[97:36.65]Go get them.
[97:38.44]Hey, and another thing, if it's too hot in the pocket, scramble out of there, you got me?
[97:42.80]Hey, babyface, the magazine here says you got the best passing game in town.
[97:47.34]I hope they're right.
[97:48.18]Come on, Fetterman, the kid's got a job to do.
[97:50.91]Kid, remember, keep them off balance with the run.
[97:58.47]Are you ready to prove what a number one draft pick can do?
[98:02.49]Outstanding, rookie!
[98:05.37]Okay, men.
[98:07.40]We fought for our place at the table.
[98:10.12]Now, it's time to... This is a big job today!
[100:03.80]Hello.
[100:06.36]I'm going to let you guys pick the next one.
[100:08.00]And I'm going to judge it by the amount of, you know, whoever says what.
[100:12.94]It's going to be hard choice.
[100:15.22]I can already tell you it's going to be very difficult for you.
[100:20.66]You are going to choose between Rise of the Robots or the Olympic Summer Games.
[100:34.08]We're on a sports theme right now.
[100:36.58]Both of these look crazy.
[100:39.84]Crazy.
[100:47.10]Seeing robots.
[100:47.86]A lot of robots, but we got a poll up there though.
[100:54.39]Vote on it if you will.
[100:56.11]I'm going to swap this out.
[101:07.08]What is it looking like so far?
[101:09.87]Robots is dominating right now.
[101:11.95]So we're going to do Rise of the Robots.
[101:13.71]It's at a level that it cannot be overtaken for sure.
[101:16.73]Alright, give me one second.
[101:29.70]Someone just said Rise of the Robots is ass.
[101:32.48]Don't play it.
[101:34.57]Well, we're going to play most of these or all of them, considering I've got them.
[101:40.35]You don't get a bunch of 3DO games and go, you know what?
[101:42.75]No, we're not going to play that one.
[101:44.98]We're going to play them all.
[101:47.58]Or at least 90% of them.
[101:52.80]Okay.
[101:54.59]Rise of the Robots.
[102:09.58]Wrap yourselves in.
[102:19.41]Okay.
[102:23.89]We'll play the Olympics one after this.
[102:25.07]Okay.
[102:45.35]Garage, no audio.
[102:46.31]Why does this one have sound?
[102:55.29]I don't hear any sound.
[103:05.02]Hello?
[103:06.78]How many splash screens are there?
[103:10.46]Okay.
[103:21.83]That was actually the Family Guy joke, it was.
[103:29.71]Alright.
[103:33.24]We're put together, we're ready to... I don't even know what to do in this game.
[103:42.85]In the not so distant future, robots rule the world.
[103:50.35]Cars are going fast.
[103:50.91]Alright, I'll shut up.
[103:52.37]I don't have to say, I don't have to have zero seconds of fucking silence.
[103:58.83]Okay.
[104:17.43]Oh, added the drums on the timeline, alright.
[104:22.60]What's that?
[104:23.02]Probably horns.
[104:25.04]But that's what I'm thinking.
[104:25.86]It's going to be horns.
[104:29.43]Yep.
[104:31.17]There's the next part.
[104:35.83]And that's going to add somebody going like.
[104:38.25]Yeah.
[104:39.17]Here it comes.
[104:45.72]I was wrong.
[104:50.76]This is just a how it's made intro.
[104:56.39]And this is what happens in how it's made intro.
[105:02.50]The rubber bands go down the conveyor belt.
[105:06.38]Each rubber band is sorted into three different categories.
[105:10.16]Small, medium, and large.
[105:15.13]I'm way shorter than I thought I was going to be.
[105:16.95]I'm small.
[105:19.41]I thought this character was going to be seven feet tall.
[105:21.17]I'm like 5'2".
[105:27.14]Alright, here we go.
[105:27.86]I need to make sure this is synced up, okay?
[105:31.34]And one, two, one, two, one, two, one.
[105:39.82]Are we okay?
[105:45.45]Alright, I think we're okay.
[105:50.10]uh do I dare I mean do I should I do training or do we just go just just go in just feet to the fire who cares I don't know how this is training but apparently this is me being trained oh I think it's training for each individual character
[106:20.73]I think I'm going to have to go with 3D glasses gorilla.
[106:40.53]No, don't.
[106:41.13]That's the only thing we're going to see in chat now.
[106:42.74]And they're going to be on this for the next four hours.
[106:53.86]Okay.
[106:55.44]I have no idea what this game is.
[106:56.84]There was no back of the box on this one.
[107:08.22]That loop is wonderful.
[107:13.93]Ooh.
[107:22.06]Okay, so here, welcome to my Blender tutorial.
[107:23.82]This is how you make, uh, I made this guy.
[107:25.54]He's kind of like a gorilla with 3D glasses, and we're going to start over from the beginning, and I'll show you kind of how I do it and how I made it.
[107:35.24]Robot identified.
[107:36.16]Builder class 2.
[107:37.02]Heavy constructed robot.
[107:38.42]Intelligence low.
[107:39.72]Power high.
[107:40.58]Combat ability average.
[107:41.90]Strength powerful.
[107:42.78]Arms weak.
[107:43.66]Legs limited.
[107:44.28]Tactical abilities threat minimum.
[107:46.64]Minimum threat.
[107:48.60]Stupid strong guy is actually kind of terrifying.
[107:59.39]OK.
[108:01.69]Final checks.
[108:04.33]About one.
[108:05.88]Prepare for combat.
[108:19.54]He is pretty stupid.
[108:23.08]Is there an uppercut?
[108:28.07]I didn't need to do the training.
[108:29.39]There's two buttons.
[108:32.54]It's punch or punch.
[108:34.06]That's it.
[108:34.68]It's just punch or punch.
[108:37.16]Okay.
[108:39.12]Alright, will you stop playing punch out against me and fucking fight me?
[108:43.57]Okay, he's dead.
[108:44.81]Alright, I don't need any training.
[108:52.95]Gosh, they have so much cool music that they've been showing this whole time and now it's just quiet.
[109:03.97]Can I play as the other characters rather than the kind of like default skin?
[109:10.66]I think I'm gonna beat this whole game by the way.
[109:20.12]Fucking hit him!
[109:21.73]Hit him!
[109:27.81]This is so stupid, come on!
[109:38.00]Stop doing that.
[109:39.08]He's gonna win because of this defense shit.
[109:42.46]No.
[109:43.16]I had no HP left.
[109:44.18]Yeah, see you at Evo.
[109:49.73]Alright, it's time to play the real game now.
[109:59.93]Mission.
[110:04.98]Mission.
[110:07.32]So it's a fighting game, I get it.
[110:10.54]Oh, you can only do it in multiplayer?
[110:26.19]Okay.
[110:32.14]Alright, who's up first?
[110:41.57]We got more stuff to see.
[110:45.31]There's a crusty hallway.
[110:56.64]Oh no.
[111:00.44]Kind of intimidating.
[111:12.60]Doesn't he have machine guns?
[111:20.66]Robot identified.
[111:21.46]Loader class one.
[111:22.22]Components loading.
[111:22.94]Robot.
[111:23.58]Intelligence low.
[111:24.58]Power low.
[111:25.55]Combat low.
[111:26.53]Strengths solid build.
[111:28.39]Weak.
[111:28.91]Speed.
[111:29.61]Everything.
[111:30.73]Threat.
[111:31.37]Minimum.
[111:32.31]Useless.
[111:34.51]This is just a repurposed forklift.
[111:36.05]This thing sucks.
[111:45.07]It's, wow, small, that thing is way small.
[111:47.43]This is like, what?
[111:48.31]I thought it was going to be way huger.
[111:52.08]They made that so assuming.
[111:54.66]It's just this little guy.
[111:55.72]Oh, shit.
[111:59.64]Don't get cocky.
[112:03.11]Are there moves besides punches?
[112:05.05]Doesn't matter.
[112:05.43]Alright, that actually is kind of screwing with me here.
[112:19.33]Got it.
[112:22.69]Stop spamming.
[112:26.72]There is no don't spam.
[112:28.32]There's two moves per character.
[112:29.86]There's punch and low punch.
[112:36.24]Wait, I just did a kick.
[112:46.49]I cannot lose to this thing.
[113:08.49]Stop running out the clock and fight me!
[113:13.21]Stop!
[113:17.81]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[113:20.47]What is happening?
[113:25.35]You can't be serious!
[113:26.67]You're not gonna run the clock out and win!
[113:32.37]I won.
[113:32.69]Okay, thank goodness.
[113:45.15]I think, okay, we already know Gorilla.
[113:47.03]I already know Gorilla's moves.
[113:59.44]We didn't see Gorilla's intro though.
[114:16.58]What is this game called?
[114:17.50]This game is called Rise of the Robots for the 3DO.
[114:27.23]It might be on SEGA CD as well.
[114:29.87]Or, like, Windows 3.2.
[114:31.29]Not sure.
[114:35.15]Okay, I already can beat Guerrilla.
[114:36.83]I already did.
[114:44.50]It was on SNES?
[114:45.68]What?! !
[114:47.70]That's really surprising.
[114:50.35]This would be a pretty rare SNES cartridge.
[114:52.19]I mean, absolutely embarrassing this person.
[115:11.69]Yeah, that was not a way easier than the forklift.
[115:29.93]I used to be able to do a 32 hit combo with smoke on Mortal Kombat 3.
[115:33.58]It's not even a joke.
[115:35.66]I used to be able to beat the big kids.
[115:38.34]That's right.
[115:42.62]People would come over, you know, because if you lose, you walk away.
[115:45.58]You win, you stay on.
[115:47.58]I could even beat the big kids.
[115:50.86]Oh no, that's kind of sad.
[115:51.84]He's like dead.
[116:01.25]Let me guess another.
[116:02.31]Oh no, no hallway transition.
[116:04.11]I feel like this thing is going to be dangerous.
[116:22.64]OK.
[116:26.65]Okay.
[116:26.75]This is the real fight here.
[116:27.67]Uh, I don't think there are any other characters in the game, so I think we're about to beat the boss.
[117:11.70]Oh, now you want to fight, OK.
[117:23.10]That is such insane range.
[117:26.81]That kick goes across the whole game.
[117:31.75]That was a good combo.
[117:35.05]Do I have special moves?
[117:48.75]Alright.
[117:49.41]Fight from a place of confidence.
[117:50.43]That does kind of sound like a flushing toilet, but it's okay.
[117:57.38]It actually might be.
[117:58.14]The Foley artist probably did that.
[118:00.04]A lot of your favorite game sounds, you have no idea where they come from.
[118:14.67]Stop turtling in the corner and get over here.
[118:29.36]Alright, confidence.
[118:30.24]I'm good.
[118:32.10]I'll just run the clock out, I don't care.
[118:39.81]Nah, we're good.
[118:40.39]Alright, that's another victory.
[118:41.37]Did I just beat the game?
[118:57.38]Okay.
[119:08.20]POV?
[119:20.70]Oh wait.
[119:23.08]I think it's a clone of us.
[119:39.70]Oh no.
[119:40.04]Okay.
[120:07.87]Oh no, this actually is kind of scary.
[120:15.21]OK, I hear Darth Vader sounds.
[120:22.87]That hurts a lot.
[120:31.12]You suck actually.
[120:44.53]Weak to the punches.
[120:46.35]Very weak to the body punches.
[120:47.77]This is over.
[120:55.36]See you later.
[120:57.60]Send in the next robot, please.
[121:16.72]I'm not even sad about that one.
[121:26.33]There's another one.
[121:26.97]I don't think there were any more on the screen.
[121:28.53]There were no more to train for.
[121:30.35]So whatever this is, this is probably the final boss.
[121:38.42]We've seen everybody up until this point.
[121:40.52]Wait.
[121:49.78]Does it just loop?
[121:51.48]Wait, is there no end?
[121:54.78]Okay, but is this forklift smarter than the last one?
[121:58.08]That's the real question.
[122:06.93]Okay, loader class one.
[122:08.31]No, low, low, poor.
[122:11.81]I think it just looped around.
[122:21.94]I think it actually might just infinite loop.
[122:23.88]Yeah.
[122:27.44]Is that what is there no credits?
[122:28.74]Did I beat it?
[122:29.30]I guess I can say I beat this one.
[122:43.59]Why is he harder than all the others?
[122:56.58]Alright, if I beat this and it's Gorilla, then we're gonna do the Olympics one.
[123:01.87]Why did the 3DO fail?
[123:05.03]3DO didn't fail!
[123:19.18]The game had a sequel.
[123:21.12]Rightfully so, it deserved to have a sequel.
[123:25.80]Okay, let's kill the forklift.
[123:27.20]Alright, is it just gorilla again?
[123:33.22]Name someone with a 3DO right now.
[123:35.12]Me.
[123:42.89]There.
[123:43.65]Me.
[123:50.11]Alright, I think, uh... I think we're gonna run down a hallway and see a gorilla.
[124:08.12]Okay, that's it.
[124:08.74]I'm gone.
[124:10.40]That was fun.
[124:10.89]That was Rise of the Robots.
[124:12.29]It was a good one.
[124:12.95]It was fun.
[124:15.33]Let's go ahead and play the Olympics now.
[124:19.91]Very cool.
[124:20.59]We're all so excited about it.
[124:30.88]Is cheat codes in mod chat?
[124:32.68]Wait, what?
[124:33.04]What do you mean cheat codes?
[124:44.61]Hold on.
[124:45.61]Cheats?
[124:52.66]Two player.
[124:53.98]When in the mode select screen.
[124:56.64]Boss code?
[124:59.16]View all cinema scenes.
[125:04.64]OK, when the mode select screen comes up.
[125:09.59]Alright, I think I just need to lose.
[125:10.57]Just beat me.
[125:19.46]I can't believe I'm still alive.
[125:26.72]It would actually even faster for me to kill all three people that are left then lose to this guy once.
[125:33.19]Can I just leave?
[125:36.57]Oh, yeah, there we go.
[125:42.72]Okay, when the mode select screen comes up, press up.
[125:45.40]Okay.
[125:46.72]Up, right, down, left, B. The second player can now play as the boss.
[125:55.27]That's the boss.
[126:10.26]Um, I don't even have a second- I don't even think the 3DO can have a second controller slot.
[126:14.00]There's only one controller slot.
[126:17.89]I'm not kidding.
[126:18.45]The 3DO has one controller slot.
[126:21.99]How does this work?
[126:29.55]Shit.
[126:29.95]This dude's got a car engine in his chest.
[126:37.01]We are.
[126:44.88]He's got super unleaded, not regular unleaded.
[126:58.59]Security droid.
[126:59.39]High intelligence, good power, excellent combat, strength, excellent, weak, no weaknesses.
[127:06.81]High?
[127:09.39]Not even dangerous?
[127:22.15]Go.
[127:22.21]OK, so now we're going to play the Olympics.
[127:35.78]See you guys in a second when I switch the discs.
[127:49.89]Doesn't matter how flashy you are.
[127:51.73]Doesn't matter how expensive all your shit is.
[127:54.15]You still gotta perform.
[127:55.23]Alright, this is the Olympic Games by Panasonic.
[128:11.14]I believe this is a 3DO exclusive because it's the Panasonic 3DO.
[128:16.26]Looking forward to playing an exclusive game.
[128:28.21]Okay, you see?
[128:28.97]There we go.
[128:53.17]You actually can make something like this in 3D Movie Maker.
[128:58.81]That actually could have been made in 3D Movie Maker.
[129:00.37]Okay, this is... 1996 Atlanta.
[129:05.46]Atlanta 96.
[129:05.74]This is very crusty.
[129:32.53]Whoa.
[129:45.90]Dude, this goes harder than most intros to any sports game.
[129:50.60]Holy shit.
[129:54.46]Wow.
[129:55.98]Who was the art director?
[129:57.28]Who was the director of this?
[130:00.15]Because they absolutely nailed it.
[130:04.84]I can't wait to play this.
[130:05.58]This is going to be game of the century.
[130:17.33]Archery, there's running, there's weightlifting.
[130:21.69]Welcome to the next at least two to three hours of the stream.
[130:24.41]I hope you're ready for this.
[130:33.76]Coins.
[130:42.05]That was a perfect frame to... Alright, here we go.
[130:46.63]Should I just go right to the Olympics?
[130:56.20]Oh, I can... Okay, here we go.
[130:59.90]Yeah, let's do, uh, USA.
[131:04.51]Name.
[131:06.01]One Up.
[131:07.61]That's fine.
[131:08.53]I'm... That's okay.
[131:09.59]I don't care.
[131:12.89]I'll stay with 1up.
[131:13.87]Player 1.
[131:18.78]Name 1up.
[131:20.24]Make it Jex instead.
[131:27.56]How about... 9up?
[131:29.30]Nup?
[131:35.19]That's kind of a J if they can be juke.
[131:47.47]I like it.
[131:47.91]I'm happy with it.
[131:50.57]Uh, okay.
[131:52.14]I don't want to get spoiled.
[131:52.90]I think we just go right to the Olympics.
[131:54.22]Fuck it.
[131:54.82]Who cares?
[131:56.14]I'm just going to the Olympics.
[132:01.54]Who needs practice?
[132:03.05]What?
[132:03.35]Tapping A as fast as you can for half of the games?
[132:05.87]No way.
[132:06.13]We're good.
[132:07.39]Gold medal everywhere.
[132:08.49]Every single event.
[132:10.27]Or I'll delete my Twitch channel.
[132:20.23]when I play this in, like, another... 10 years.
[132:22.76]Okay, what's the game?
[132:25.76]Start the Olympics.
[132:26.96]100 meter dash.
[132:33.40]Okay.
[132:37.06]Okay.
[132:40.78]The world record is 9.85.
[132:42.84]Wow, really?
[132:43.50]This looks like... It was... Okay, this looks like it was made in a smart fridge.
[132:57.17]This could have been made in Roblox.
[132:59.99]Alright, I'm assuming it's just tap A really fast.
[133:03.87]I think?
[133:04.74]I don't know.
[133:05.20]I don't know how to play.
[133:05.92]How do I run?
[133:09.28]I don't know.
[133:24.39]That guy was poisoned.
[133:26.20]My guy was poisoned.
[133:28.50]Somebody poisoned him at the fucking entrance.
[133:40.11]I think it's alternate A and B very fast.
[133:45.19]That's fine.
[133:46.49]We'll get the next one.
[133:53.04]Next event.
[133:54.52]Oh, no, we do it again.
[133:55.44]Alright, watch this.
[133:56.18]I'm going to blow everybody away.
[133:57.50]This is going to be unbelievable.
[133:58.70]I'm going to get eight seconds.
[134:06.69]Am I not even in it anymore?
[134:07.83]I'm not even in the race anymore.
[134:13.31]That slot, did I do so bad that I got disqualified?
[134:20.27]I'm not even in the game.
[134:21.09]There's a slot for another person and I'm not in it.
[134:24.22]Oh, that was a photo finish!
[134:38.90]Is it Ireland?
[134:53.32]Is Ireland have 100 meter runners that are fast?
[135:06.39]Do I get to fucking play?
[135:19.80]Are we gonna go through every country on Earth?
[135:27.98]I think we're going to go through every country.
[135:35.33]Bro, this is how the Olympics work.
[135:37.17]I don't know.
[135:37.91]I didn't know we were going to do all that.
[135:51.00]Okay.
[135:51.50]Alright.
[135:51.78]So now what?
[135:55.98]Are we going to keep going?
[135:56.94]Dude, we're actually going to go through every single country on Earth before I get to play again.
[136:14.43]Wait, do I not... Wait, is it just the people that did better than everybody?
[136:22.90]Oh, I just skipped.
[136:26.79]When do I get to play?
[136:27.93]Did I do so bad that I got eliminated immediately?
[136:42.07]Okay.
[136:43.77]We'll get the next event.
[136:48.85]Discus throw.
[136:49.35]We're going to be huge on this one.
[136:50.55]Alright, here we go.
[137:08.37]Um... Um...
[137:35.21]I need to practice these before I do the Olympics.
[137:45.82]How do you even have that happen?
[137:51.31]That's so stupid, you could like Mario Kart yourself in the head.
[138:02.32]Alright, we're gonna get last place on this one too.
[138:05.13]Oh, that hurt.
[138:12.81]That's the kind of stuff that happens before the event starts.
[138:16.79]The guy in the funny costume comes out and does that for the kids to laugh at.
[138:21.42]But that was the United States, that was the U.S.
[138:24.28]Olymple, Olymple, Olymple qualifier.
[138:30.20]That's not very good.
[138:36.99]Oh, should I just go practice these?
[138:38.67]No, who cares?
[138:39.67]It doesn't matter.
[138:40.20]Alright, well, I'm not going to be able to do it again.
[138:44.12]Maybe if that counts as a fault or a foul?
[138:46.96]Do I get to try again?
[138:53.60]Holy shit, so many people do this.
[139:09.17]Oh, just because I knocked myself out with a discus doesn't mean I get to do it again?
[139:11.99]Did I just sit through all this?
[139:23.60]Okay, second attempt.
[139:24.80]I don't know how this works.
[139:39.80]Did I do it?
[139:44.08]I did it!
[139:48.63]We'd expect better from a world-class athlete.
[140:03.74]Okay.
[140:04.78]I have to tap it?
[140:07.16]He needs a very good throw to beat the records.
[140:09.47]Alright, let's get a world record here.
[140:12.49]I think I have to get it right in the middle.
[140:19.90]That's gotta be pretty good, right?
[140:25.22]That's huge!
[140:27.25]Oh my god!
[140:55.40]Okay.
[140:59.06]There's so many fucking... Okay.
[141:01.78]Let's go.
[141:07.51]High jump.
[141:12.67]After I lose the Olympics, I'm gonna go practice.
[141:22.92]My ears feel like a carpet floor right now.
[141:27.78]Oh, I can set how high I want it.
[141:29.50]The world record is 2.45, so let's go 2.44.
[141:30.78]No.
[141:30.86]2 point... 2 point... What's a good one to try?
[141:31.92]2.3?
[141:31.94]2.35.
[141:31.98]Ooh!
[141:53.00]That's clean right there, actually.
[141:54.52]2.35.
[141:54.58]World records.
[141:55.96]I'll get it.
[141:56.48]2.35.
[141:59.15]Ain't nobody gonna get that.
[142:13.34]This person's attempting 2.27.
[142:14.64]I already beat him.
[142:21.30]Not even gonna be close.
[142:25.77]That's fine.
[142:29.99]I'm 2.35.
[142:30.11]2.26.
[142:30.13]2.25.
[142:30.19]I'm in the lead.
[142:30.57]2.25.
[142:30.65]I'm going to get the gold medal. 2.25.
[142:56.29]2.25.
[142:56.39]I win.
[143:02.29]Wait.
[143:03.03]2.3.
[143:03.09]Be close if he gets this.
[143:12.14]Go for the world record next time?
[143:13.32]I will.
[143:17.36]Uh-oh.
[143:21.24]All the hard work and determination is really paying off for these athletes.
[143:26.31]Wait, where am I?
[143:38.04]Where's my character?
[143:43.44]Am I number one?
[143:44.20]I don't know, did I just not see it?

[144:23.73]Okay.
[144:29.44]Still in first place.
[144:30.08]2.27.
[144:30.10]Nope.
[144:34.06]We're just going to skip.
[144:34.92]2.25.

[145:17.32]Uh-oh.
[145:18.58]Okay.
[145:18.72]Okay.
[145:21.06]means I gotta go for the world record 2.34 we're higher it doesn't matter that's alright we're 2.35 2.22 doesn't matter 2.28 he's good jumped this height before
[145:50.90]For a second, I thought he was saying he's never jumped before.
[145:52.93]2.25, whatever.
[145:56.13]2.26, okay, whatever.
[145:56.51]2.25, okay, whatever.
[145:57.09]2.28.
[146:00.79]So many to go through.
[146:01.91]2.37, uh-oh.
[146:20.23]Don't put me down to third place.
[146:21.67]I'm just gonna have to break the whole world record.
[146:24.86]Alright, that's fine.
[146:35.00]That's alright.
[146:40.31]We're in bronze right now.
[146:41.43]I gotta go for something big here.
[146:42.63]2.35.
[146:42.65]What happens if you're tied?
[146:54.53]This is still the actual world record.
[146:56.17]It's 2.45.
[146:57.07]Really?
[146:57.29]Damn.
[146:58.23]It's been like 25 years.
[146:59.07]Got it.
[147:06.15]Okay.
[147:09.87]Well, now we're in trouble.
[147:12.57]I gotta go big.
[147:13.13]He's never jumped this height before.
[147:25.87]I'm realizing right now we're going to have to skip through 30 different things.
[147:32.41]If I just get the world record, I'm just going to hit B over and over again and turn the screen off so it doesn't hurt your eyes.
[147:37.16]Is this the kind of game that your grandmother plays?
[147:43.58]I do have a favorite.
[147:46.50]Scan your grandmother's computer for viruses.
[148:02.15]Okay, here we go.
[148:05.59]We're going to break the world record by an unbelievable margin.
[148:12.65]This is going to be insane.
[148:14.62]Here we go.
[148:15.16]Get off!
[148:15.64]Get off!
[148:31.67]Oh, now I have to skip everything.
[148:33.11]Okay, I'm going to just go like this.
[148:40.15]And just... I don't want to see all this.
[148:42.31]This is going to take 10 minutes.
[148:43.89]It's going to hurt your eyes.
[148:45.71]No one's even coming close.
[148:46.69]Don't worry.
[148:46.97]I'm just going to get the world record.
[148:54.76]The standings are exactly the same.
[148:56.04]Yeah, and I'll turn it down.
[149:01.50]Nope, no one's even coming close.
[149:03.04]We're still at 2.35, still in third place.
[149:13.21]Alright, I'm going to go 2.44.
[149:23.71]No one's attempting to go over 2.35.
[149:24.78]It's still the same record.
[149:40.08]Go for 2.46?
[149:47.70]This sounds like my fan at night.
[149:52.92]Your fan's fucked up, dude.
[149:59.51]Dude, blow some of the dust off that fan.
[150:07.72]Alright, we're getting there.
[150:08.44]We're almost there.
[150:08.86]Almost there.
[150:10.80]Same exact standings.
[150:12.08]No difference.
[150:19.73]Only like two more.
[150:23.33]Here we go.
[150:24.83]It is now my turn.
[150:26.79]And, oh my god, I pressed A. I pressed A. I, I, okay.
[150:34.43]Is that, that's alright.
[150:34.99]That's alright.
[150:41.27]Oh, fuck.
[150:43.25]I forget what.
[150:43.73]I was skipping so much.
[150:52.83]Alright, I just just minimize the window for a second.
[151:08.33]It hurts my eyes.
[151:09.25]I don't want to hurt your eyes.
[151:18.97]What's your favorite french fry shape?
[151:20.57]Uh, definitely shoestring.
[151:25.62]We want it?
[151:26.04]Okay.
[151:28.16]Well, this is 2.38, so we gotta watch this one.
[151:31.56]This is the last round here.
[151:32.80]I have one more attempt.
[151:33.58]I'm gonna do... Okay, I'm doing 2.43.
[151:36.24]Shoestring, the best fries.
[151:49.04]What are the standings now?
[151:51.09]I'm still in the bronze medal.
[151:56.69]2.24, that's fine.
[152:00.51]2.3, that's fine, whatever.
[152:01.79]2.46 or nothing.
[152:10.57]I have, no, I got three tries.
[152:11.73]Everybody gets three tries.
[152:12.43]See, one, two, three, right?
[152:18.37]I think it's coming up here.
[152:19.13]I don't want to just press A. He's never jumped this high before.
[152:26.75]It's very shape.
[152:27.85]Uh, probably square.
[152:31.19]Oh shit.
[152:32.57]That's 2.39.
[152:32.77]We're still in third place.
[152:35.76]It's fine.
[152:40.76]Alright.
[152:41.00]I'm now in fourth place.
[152:44.18]Here it comes pretty soon here.
[152:50.58]Alright, I think it's coming up right now.
[152:53.99]One more.
[152:57.49]You already went three times?
[152:58.73]Wait, did I?
[152:59.11]I thought I only went... Oh, I already... Did I already go three times?
[153:09.15]Oh, shit.
[153:09.67]I did go three times.
[153:10.75]Because I fucked up one of the times.
[153:16.64]No podium for you.
[153:18.02]Oh, my God.
[153:18.74]Okay, well, whatever.
[153:21.23]Yeah, look, here I am.
[153:23.35]Alright, 2.46.
[153:24.57]Break the world record and fucking all the haters can fucking shove it up their ass.
[153:36.80]I just broke the world.
[153:37.58]I just got first place.
[153:46.94]I win.
[153:51.79]Yeah, no one's gonna come close, so I just got the gold medal.
[153:53.91]We win.
[153:55.25]Good game.
[154:01.37]No, 2.29.
[154:02.37]No one's even gonna... I just need to skip all this.
[154:08.79]Can I, like, skip this whole thing?
[154:10.39]I don't... I think we have to do this.
[154:15.55]He's doping?
[154:16.49]Hahaha.
[154:25.75]No one's doing 250.
[154:26.43]That's not going to happen.
[154:30.29]Just play arcade.
[154:31.30]I think that's... I did not realize it was going to be like this.
[154:36.04]We'll go to arcade mode.
[154:48.04]Hey, at least I got a gold medal.
[154:57.96]Alright, I'm just going to go as fast as I can, Skiffing.
[155:05.54]This is going to continue until everybody fails three times?
[155:08.30]No, it's not.
[155:10.32]Are you serious?
[155:21.75]Yes.
[155:24.39]Wait, this is going to take like 45 straight minutes.
[155:38.47]Everybody needs to fail three times.
[155:47.78]Did they expect anybody to do anything but play this event?
[155:51.90]Let's go for the whole, let's go for smash the whole thing.
[155:54.78]Okay, I have to reset the game.
[156:08.06]I don't want to do that.
[156:08.58]I don't want to sit here while we fucking scream at everybody.
[156:12.16]I have to turn the game off.
[156:13.40]I have to turn off the game.
[156:18.89]I'm resetting the game.
[156:31.64]Okay.
[156:34.54]We're going to do arcade mode.
[156:38.78]That would have taken so unbelievably long.
[156:41.54]That's so funny in a horrible way.
[156:49.22]To beat the whole thing, it would be about 200 hours.
[156:50.96]Well, let's go.
[156:52.90]I want to play the other events.
[157:09.41]Okay.
[157:10.19]Game.
[157:12.59]That's fine.
[157:18.12]So what event should I play?
[157:19.88]Wait, what are we doing?
[157:20.66]I don't understand.
[157:29.99]CPU skip?
[157:42.00]I'm going to blow everybody away this time.
[157:45.58]On your marks, get set,
[157:55.50]I couldn't have gone much faster than that.
[157:59.16]I just beat the world record.
[158:01.68]Okay.
[158:02.71]Perfect.
[158:03.53]That's one world record done.
[158:22.22]How do I pick the game?
[158:24.68]Oh, Discus, okay.
[158:26.72]CPU skip, on.
[158:29.44]Yes.
[158:31.70]Good, okay.
[158:32.86]CPU skip, yes.
[158:35.63]Wait, controller, let's see.
[158:37.21]Alright, controller.
[158:39.09]Method 1, A, B, yeah, that's fine, I guess.
[158:44.39]Alright, now we can do it.
[158:53.92]This would be way less painful now.
[158:55.32]I still don't understand this one.
[159:00.16]You pick the angle, right?
[159:01.14]I think you want to keep it in the middle.
[159:11.93]And then I pick the angle?
[159:19.97]I don't understand how this one works.
[159:28.75]That one doesn't, this one doesn't make any sense.
[159:32.20]I'll get another attempt though.
[159:32.98]Let's go.
[159:39.82]Yeah, what's the plan here?
[159:40.76]Because it looks like I did it in the middle.
[159:47.35]That's great.
[159:48.05]So what about the angle now?
[159:50.89]Looks like I freeze it.
[159:51.81]There's another bar right there.
[159:53.03]What was wrong with that?
[160:01.22]Is red power?
[160:02.10]I would imagine the red is power, right?
[160:03.67]This dude's got a noodle arm?
[160:06.35]Hold on, let me try one more time.
[160:13.77]I mean, should I just... Oh, wait a minute, I get it.
[160:19.22]I had it backwards.
[160:19.92]Okay, I just beat the record.
[160:24.98]That's the world record.
[160:34.96]Oh.
[160:36.72]Is it good enough?
[160:40.89]Okay.
[160:44.55]Now I'm excited.
[160:45.29]Now this is going to be a lot of fun because I can just keep going.
[160:49.09]Make sure that CPU skip is still on there.
[160:52.99]Yes, it is.
[160:55.39]Okay, I already got the world record on this one.
[160:56.73]I don't even care how bad it is.
[160:59.13]Turn the game down.
[161:01.89]Sure thing.
[161:08.29]What happens if you just do terrible?
[161:14.71]Oh my god!
[161:17.09]He did it!
[161:48.91]You can do it.
[161:53.31]Oh man.
[161:57.67]I'm just trying to fail.
[161:58.39]I already got the world record on this.
[161:59.41]I just don't want to see every country on Earth have to do it too.
[162:10.10]He sailed over the bar.
[162:13.21]Wait, what?
[162:17.09]I actually made it over the bar.
[162:18.03]Okay, I didn't even... It's so low, apparently.
[162:31.88]I think you have to actually attempt to be terrible.
[162:36.20]I don't want to... That's not a great jump.
[162:45.04]Let's make it impossible.
[162:55.54]Turn the brightness down.
[162:59.86]Guys, I think the game is just that ugly.
[163:02.83]I think that's just the game.
[163:03.69]Alright, what do we got?
[163:09.51]Pole vault.
[163:10.77]Oh dear, this is going to end poorly.
[163:14.64]I'm going to like die.
[163:15.56]Alright.
[163:22.28]Five.
[163:22.64]Let's go five.
[163:24.00]Let's go 6.0.
[163:24.62]We have two bars here.
[163:28.08]We have speed and then probably angle.
[163:41.54]I didn't do it.
[163:42.22]Okay.
[163:47.02]So I have to get it right in the middle.
[163:55.36]That's pretty good.
[163:55.94]Not good enough.
[164:01.46]My ears.
[164:14.05]That's a fast runner.
[164:18.56]What are you doing?
[164:19.12]Okay, well that one was stupid.
[164:27.49]This game came out the same here as Crash Bandicoot.
[164:31.23]True.
[164:35.19]Alright, what's next?
[164:36.23]That's it?
[164:36.63]400 meter dash.
[164:46.68]Hammer throw.
[164:48.80]Okay.
[164:49.03]Yes.
[164:49.33]Fencing, swimming.
[164:50.19]Where was all this?
[164:52.61]Long jump.
[164:54.03]Shooting.
[164:55.29]Okay.
[164:55.61]I want to do fencing.
[165:00.59]Get that off.
[165:04.43]Let's do fencing, swimming, weightlifting.
[165:09.03]Uh, I want to do long jump.
[165:11.47]Rapid.
[165:11.87]Yeah, these.
[165:12.35]Alright, let's go.
[165:18.98]How do I do it?
[165:26.81]Restart or?
[165:33.67]There we go.
[165:40.18]Can I eat your 3DO when you're done with it?
[165:42.64]Nope, it's for me.
[165:43.62]Sorry.
[165:44.90]Okay, I got the bar in the middle.
[165:51.04]And then there's an angle.
[165:59.26]What?
[166:03.95]People are screaming!
[166:10.39]How do I jump?
[166:15.83]What's jump?
[166:21.54]Okay, I don't know how to jump.
[166:33.86]I'm pressing every single button.
[166:42.52]It's not L, R, up, down, left, over, left.
[166:45.68]There's no way to do it.
[166:53.35]How do I move on to the next event?
[167:05.17]How do I move on?
[167:06.07]Okay.
[167:22.26]Swimming.
[167:31.46]This is like seven frames a second.
[167:39.71]I've never seen so much artifacting and aliasing.
[167:47.55]Okay, let's go.
[167:48.25]Go!
[168:02.16]I think I'm doing alright.
[168:13.49]It's lagging so bad.
[168:21.03]What's going on?
[168:24.01]Wait, is that my stamina bar?
[168:30.43]I'm struggling right now, but it doesn't matter.
[168:41.77]Don't even tell me.
[168:42.39]Come on, I got it.
[168:46.01]Got it.
[168:46.25]OK, that was fun.
[168:52.45]I love this game.
[168:53.49]I love it for all the right reasons.
[168:57.34]OK, that one was cool.
[169:05.54]The next one is very exciting to me.
[169:10.71]I think it's going to be really good.
[169:15.39]The game's lagging so bad I can't even pause the game.
[169:18.99]The game crashed.
[169:23.19]The system crashed.
[169:24.29]The 3DO just crashed.
[169:30.30]Oh no!
[169:33.62]My 3DO just... That game just bricked my 3DO.
[169:51.63]I think I was getting a memory leak or something.
[169:53.47]That was kind of crazy.
[169:54.45]Alright.
[169:54.67]I do... I want to see one more... I don't want... I want to see the other game.
[169:59.23]I want to do shooting.
[170:03.02]And then it's fine.
[170:04.88]We already did that.
[170:05.48]I don't care about those.
[170:06.86]It's going to be just a reskin fencing weightlifting.
[170:10.76]That's it.
[170:11.88]Okay, let's go.
[170:15.08]Rapid fire pistol.
[170:29.07]Do I go?
[170:35.63]Oh, I'm aiming at the other person's target.
[170:38.01]Here we go.
[170:38.46]Now I get it.
[170:38.88]Now I get it.
[170:39.34]I'll do good this time.
[171:11.53]That'd be pretty damn good.
[171:12.33]World record is 598.
[171:12.97]Oh, it's going faster.
[171:17.82]That's OK.
[171:46.33]Oh, that was fun.
[171:55.60]I want to do weightlifting.
[171:56.90]Yeah, here it is.
[171:57.44]150 kilograms.
[172:04.47]Let's do 180.
[172:19.43]When do I pull it up?
[172:23.65]When do I do it?
[172:24.13]What is going on?
[172:59.20]Oh shit, I did it.
[173:00.56]Oh my god, there's another one.
[173:10.99]Got it.
[173:12.77]Oh my god, hold on.
[173:15.55]Whoa!
[173:17.27]Hold it steady, steady, steady, steady.
[173:22.61]Doesn't this count?
[173:23.39]When do they count the points?
[173:24.43]This is ridiculous.
[173:27.81]He looked in trouble from the start.
[173:29.67]How do I not get points?
[173:30.89]I held it up like a... A wrestler.
[173:34.09]What are you talking about?
[173:35.03]How is it a failure?
[173:35.77]Lift.
[173:49.36]The clean.
[173:50.10]That's the lift onto the shoulder.
[173:55.84]Okay, that was fun.
[173:58.63]He didn't lock in.
[173:59.51]I absolutely did.
[174:00.73]I'm telling you, that's what I did.
[174:01.77]Alright, skeet shooting.
[174:13.49]Okay.
[174:20.90]You didn't reload the gun yet?
[174:22.26]Nice.
[174:29.78]I think I'm going to be good at this one.
[174:38.89]He's almost used up all of his misses.
[174:44.93]Remember the shooters here are having to reload.
[174:53.10]There's some accurate shooting going on here.
[175:02.40]I think it's a different button for each shot.
[175:06.50]It is.
[175:06.70]Okay, it's A for the first shot, B for the second one.
[175:10.23]What the hell is that, by the way?
[175:13.09]Pull!
[175:16.55]Pull!
[175:17.27]Pull!
[175:36.90]Saved it.
[175:44.65]I don't even want to see the result.
[175:53.09]Alright, fencing.
[175:53.67]No more memory leaks.
[175:54.55]That would be great.
[176:04.62]Who's the person on the bottom?
[176:07.26]Okay, here we go.
[176:15.65]What?
[176:18.89]You just stabbed me in the face!
[176:20.97]What?
[176:21.27]That hurt!
[176:21.83]You hurt me!
[176:22.99]You just hurt me!
[176:26.73]This person is not being respectful of the rules.
[176:29.89]They're being incredibly anti-professional.
[176:38.08]Hey, how about that?
[176:38.58]Yeah, nice dive.
[176:39.36]I feel like I'd be really good at this in real life.
[177:17.08]I really think I could fence in real life.
[177:19.42]If you taught me, if you gave me like a professional, like gold medal fencer, I feel like I could pick it up and be like a bronze level fencer in like six months.
[177:32.77]How do I aim?
[177:38.83]Whoa.
[177:39.35]Okay.
[177:40.21]Where do I put this?
[177:43.01]Is it right there?
[177:43.65]It's like right here, right?
[177:49.13]Did I not shoot the arrow?
[177:50.57]That is way farther.
[178:05.59]Why is it taking so long to get there?
[178:18.59]Oh, okay.
[178:21.89]My wind is pushing it down.
[178:22.89]I got to aim way higher, like up here.
[178:27.19]Right there.
[178:29.06]The wind just changed immediately, instantly.
[178:30.96]And just messed everything up.
[178:40.42]You're using the wrong crosshair?
[178:42.62]It's not that right there?
[178:43.50]I feel like it would be.
[178:50.65]It's the left one?
[178:54.54]I didn't know that's what that was.
[179:02.84]Ooh, getting closer.
[179:12.68]Okay, I get it.
[179:13.44]Let me do this one more time.
[179:23.84]Okay, now I get what's going on.
[179:28.15]Let me get one bullseye.
[179:38.65]Ooh!
[179:43.15]Pretty good.
[179:49.14]That's a lot of wind.
[179:54.18]Right in the middle.
[180:10.16]That's true.
[180:10.96]How would the wind be coming from below?
[180:21.85]That's true.
[180:22.57]Why would the wind be coming from the bottom?
[180:25.71]From the top to... I don't think there's very much logic in this game.
[180:30.14]I think they just kind of put in a random number generator for the wind.
[180:34.56]But that is a very... Well, there could have... You know, a big gale could have come by.
[180:38.24]It could be a storm.
[180:49.89]I'm going to give you guys a choice for the next game.
[180:52.35]The next game is either going to be fun in games or cowboy casino.
[181:04.78]Cowboy casino or fun in games.
[181:11.71]Get ready.
[181:18.70]I felt like that was going to be pretty unanimous.
[181:24.08]And it does look just as good as you think it does.
[181:26.61]Alright, that was the Olympics.
[181:29.71]I loved it, but it was absolute dog shit, but it was still fun, and it was a great game, and I loved it, and it sucked.
[181:35.61]Alright, let's do Cowboy Casino.
[181:52.95]This game is a totally complete FMV poker game, it looks like.
[181:59.53]I am so excited to play this one.
[182:01.31]It could be greatest game ever.
[182:09.97]There's been some bangers tonight.

[182:55.63]I can't wait for the panning camera while the prospector talks to you about how bad some of the people here are.
[183:03.94]I bet you somebody pulls a gun on us.
[183:05.74]We might have to fight people.
[183:08.00]I'm so excited for this game.
[183:13.17]I told you!
[183:13.91]What?
[183:21.82]A fighter with a cigarette.
[183:39.20]Which one is us?
[183:42.32]This guy's bringing his donkey in?
[183:52.58]So you don't get confused, stranger.
[183:54.76]This here's best, with all the hair on her, and I'm the one with all the money.

[184:03.36]Alright, see the color of your money.

[184:15.87]Who's sitting out?
[184:17.49]Um, I don't know.
[184:18.31]I don't want anyone to sit out.
[184:21.14]They all seem like great characters.
[184:22.56]Alright, how about Jack?
[184:29.88]Okay, win at poker.

[184:59.40]Every once in a long while, you may see something that doesn't look quite right.
[185:02.87]We'd never say... Fucking donkey.
[185:06.01]We'd never say it to their faces, but we could swear they are cheating.
[185:09.13]However, if you hang in there...

[185:24.11]Counting cards is easy for him.
[185:25.85]It will give you special advice two ways, by pressing the right shift button to open the book lying on the table, or by pressing the left shift button for Ace to tell us about pot odds, odds to the better hand, and when maybe to bluff.
[185:36.92]After selecting games, choose one of the four games by moving the directional control until you have a highlighted... I'm done with this.
[185:45.13]Partner, your odds are zero.
[185:46.51]Alright, let's go.

[186:00.14]Five chips.
[186:00.80]I got 5,000.
[186:05.85]Alright, that's a good start.
[186:07.33]Oh man, we're looking for a flush.
[186:10.49]Raise 20.
[186:11.47]Raise 20.
[186:11.67]Uh... Let's go for a raise.
[186:19.24]Raise 20.
[186:19.50]Win the hand and you lose an arm, muchacho.
[186:29.26]Okay.
[186:30.32]So if I win, he's going to fucking kill me.
[186:34.68]Uh... Should I... I'm gonna do call.
[186:41.58]Should I call or raise?
[186:43.59]No, I'm calling.
[186:45.59]I'm not folding.
[186:46.27]No, fuck that guy.
[186:49.97]Raise 20?
[186:51.67]Calling.
[186:54.79]What do you think, old girl?
[186:58.11]That was... Did you hear the record scratch?
[187:02.94]What?
[187:07.05]Oh, OK, I need I. This is a dog shit and I have a pair of eights.
[187:13.21]I have to fold.
[187:13.79]I can't.
[187:14.03]This is not going to win.
[187:14.58]I'm not going to go all in on on a pair of eights.
[187:23.34]Nobody's got shit I'm calling.
[187:24.36]Partner, your odds are one in 16.
[187:36.97]How do I win at poker?
[187:39.47]Okay, the book is telling me to raise 15.
[187:41.03]The big pot.
[187:50.70]The book says raise 15 again.
[187:52.10]I could go for a full house.
[188:02.95]That is some bed, amigo.
[188:04.89]I did not know you could count that high.
[188:13.26]Okay, so that's bad.
[188:16.94]What's the book say?
[188:18.60]Raise 15.
[188:26.80]What's the book say?
[188:27.38]I just have a pair of eights.
[188:30.17]It's over.
[188:34.55]I think I have to fold.
[188:35.25]I think I have to fold.
[188:42.84]Alright, there's only two people, three people left.
[188:49.26]Alright, now, okay, thanks a lot book.
[188:54.07]I fold.
[188:58.17]Paracoa, yeah, I would have lost.
[189:02.12]Hey, look here, Beth.
[189:03.46]I got enough hair to buy your own pack mule.
[189:08.00]What an awesome kind of career path that is.
[189:11.82]Think about that.
[189:13.18]If you're that guy, there's a very specific role that you will always have.
[189:18.45]You will be the guy that does it every time.
[189:23.13]Being the older, bearded guy that kind of talks like this at the saloon, you are guaranteed work for the rest of your life.
[189:35.87]Alright, let's do five card draw.
[189:42.52]It's kind of like being a Santa.
[189:45.84]If you're a Santa, you know you're always going to be a Santa.
[189:48.48]And actually, Santas can also be that guy too.
[189:52.24]If you're Santa, if you can go from like, oh, oh, oh, to, well, yo, hold on a second here, partner.
[189:57.96]You will have work forever.
[190:00.66]Just literally with the seasonal changes.

[190:07.88]Yeah, winter and summer gigs.
[190:09.06]Exactly.
[190:09.48]Okay, I got... I'm going to go all in.
[190:16.09]I got three aces.
[190:16.79]What?
[190:21.57]I should bet lower then.
[190:34.54]It's only 85 cents to discard up to three cards.
[190:39.53]Let's get rid of the... Let's try to go for four of a kind.
[190:45.51]I think I just threw away one of the aces.
[190:50.69]The book wants me to raise, but do I go, oh, I'll raise 15.
[190:54.57]I don't want to scare this guy.
[190:59.15]I want him to think he's going to win.
[191:04.85]What do you got?
[191:10.70]Alright.
[191:11.04]Okay.
[191:11.28]Guy on the left.
[191:11.84]Cigarette guy on the left.

[191:34.49]Three aces.
[191:35.07]No way.
[191:35.73]Raise again.
[191:40.23]Wait, hold on.
[191:40.65]Somebody get him a full house.
[191:44.65]Book says call 20.
[191:45.25]Fine.
[191:53.40]Oh, you all got fucking destroyed.
[191:54.62]Alright.
[191:56.62]5,000.
[191:57.38]Let's do that again.
[192:01.26]I like that one.
[192:01.60]That was fun.
[192:14.05]Not great.
[192:17.07]Not great.
[192:18.39]Pretty bad.
[192:21.02]Uh.
[192:21.34]Right, I think I just have to dump.
[192:27.04]How does that dump that that fold this hand suck?
[192:32.25]Yeah, I'm out.
[192:40.95]Jerma sounds, this is kind of Jerma's, I can't, I can't read.
[192:44.17]Somebody said there's a donkey here.
[192:46.27]And that's why I like it.
[192:47.21]Okay.
[192:50.29]Uh,
[193:04.13]this is great because you know they just went around the table and recorded like 20 to 30 little improv bits with each person and it doesn't really add anything to the game but it adds things to my heart I want is there a win condition or do you just play okay

[193:59.82]That's bigger than what I made mine last year?
[194:08.22]All I heard was I'm a prospector man and I have the donkeys with me.
[194:13.93]Mining.
[194:14.49]Okay.
[194:27.67]I think I get a full house here.
[194:30.78]They're all calling.
[194:31.38]Alright, let's see.
[194:31.93]Can I get a full house?

[194:38.71]Give me a six or an ace.
[194:45.67]No.
[194:51.66]I think I'm screwed.
[194:53.76]Two pair is really not bad, though.
[194:59.66]I love the fake smoke.
[195:00.44]I don't think that was those are not.
[195:02.28]Those are like it was like powder.
[195:03.70]We haven't heard from the guy on the right in a long time.
[195:32.37]That bet's bigger than what I made mine in last year.
[195:36.87]Uh-oh, we're getting repeats.
[195:43.23]Hey, I'll take it.
[195:47.35]Alright, let's do seven cards still.
[195:58.18]That bet's bigger than what I made mine in last year.
[196:10.23]Fold?
[196:10.71]Oh, fine.
[196:25.05]That coward book.
[196:26.61]Don't listen to the coward book.
[196:28.40]I had a 1 in 4 chance that the book told me to fold.
[196:32.04]What a piece of shit.
[196:38.87]I bet you feel pretty stupid losing to me.
[196:41.05]I mean, kind of.
[196:41.99]Oh, okay.
[197:08.58]Does the book say?
[197:09.64]What?
[197:10.72]No.
[197:13.75]Screw the book.
[197:22.81]I love every time it comes back that the game has trouble picking it back up.
[197:27.61]Pair of threes.
[197:32.46]Fuck it.
[197:32.90]Keep going.
[197:39.07]Alright, you got Queen.
[197:39.79]You have a flush?
[197:42.27]I don't think he doesn't have a flush.
[197:45.01]No flush, guaranteed.
[197:47.97]What do you think, old girl?
[197:54.54]It's like they couldn't... That was all the usable footage you had.
[197:59.30]What happened was after he said a bunch of shit that they said, we can't use any of this.
[198:03.65]And unfortunately, this was a ten second clip that had to become a two second clip because everything he said right after that was apparently not usable.
[198:10.84]Alright, I got... I got two pair.
[198:20.80]He could have a flush, but whatever, I'm just gonna check.
[198:25.48]Oh.
[198:28.81]Oh, fuck off.
[198:33.47]Alright, let's do five card stud.
[198:45.78]I think he's speaking a different language.
[198:50.16]I have no idea what he said.
[199:01.76]Let the other guy in to see some of the other effing views, yeah.
[199:06.82]Check.
[199:07.14]Nah, I think I'm out.
[199:09.52]Yeah, I'm out.
[199:31.26]Talk to the bartender.
[199:33.04]Bartender tells you your odds.
[199:35.46]That's the reason I like playing poker with strangers.
[199:37.70]They're too smart to cheat and too dumb to win.
[199:44.98]He's going to shoot him.
[199:55.35]What is this?
[199:57.09]Wait, I can change the max bet.
[200:22.90]Let's make the minimum bet something crazy too.
[200:25.20]Let's raise the stakes a little here.
[200:26.34]Alright, let's make the minimum bet everybody's pot.
[200:47.56]Alright, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine.
[200:53.23]Okay, I want to bring in the other player.
[200:56.16]Can I do that?
[201:00.00]I think I've eliminated that guy for life.
[201:12.97]Alright, let's actually get some stakes here.
[201:20.40]Okay, pair of threes.
[201:23.19]Alright, let's bet $1000.
[201:27.21]You either think you're getting a handful of aces or you got a head full of hay.
[201:33.34]True.
[201:34.54]And then he folds what?
[201:37.52]Oh shit.
[201:38.88]OK, I'm going for I'm going for threes.
[201:44.37]Give me give me give me more threes.
[201:48.76]It's not great.
[201:49.96]But I have two pair.
[201:53.18]Raise $1,000.
[201:53.34]Scare him.
[201:53.68]I just... Okay, I just... I cleaned up so bad.
[201:59.92]I want to see what happens if somebody loses all their chips.
[202:24.45]Yeah, I'm out.
[202:26.71]Alright, who's gonna be left after this?
[202:50.88]Wow, he actually did win.
[202:53.40]Oh man.
[202:54.52]Okay.
[202:55.95]Alright, let's actually try to have somebody go to zero here.
[203:04.55]Five card draw.
[203:05.09]Bad.
[203:18.08]Oh, okay.
[203:20.10]Okay, we're going for a flush.
[203:23.20]I gotta get it.
[203:24.02]Bet?
[203:24.80]Thousand.
[203:29.37]Okay.
[203:33.01]I'm raising another thousand.
[203:36.21]See you later.
[203:43.43]Oh shit, he's raising.
[203:45.79]Uh... I... I think we're gonna make this guy rich.
[203:52.41]This ain't no way you're gonna get the flush.
[203:54.33]It's... Hey.
[203:56.80]Uh... Fuck.
[204:05.84]It is winnable.
[204:06.64]It's got... Who cares?
[204:08.84]I got money.
[204:09.88]Uh-oh.
[204:12.94]Alright, call.
[204:16.36]That bet's bigger than what I made mine in last year.
[204:19.84]That bet's bigger than what you made and had 10 minutes ago.
[204:23.26]Alright, give me the flush.
[204:25.42]Let's go.
[204:25.74]Oh!
[204:29.76]Okay, goodbye.
[204:32.60]Oh, that's... Um... Uh-oh.
[204:36.97]I have a pair of jacks.
[204:45.06]Raise?
[204:47.20]Call the bluff?
[204:47.88]Call the bluff.
[204:48.40]Alright, I'm calling his bluff.
[204:49.20]A pair of jacks.
[204:51.84]Oh, that's... He's won $15,000.
[204:53.64]That's like $50 million in olden times.
[204:56.99]There you go, girl.
[204:58.75]Now, don't go spending it all in one place.
[205:03.42]Okay.
[205:03.86]Well, that's bad.
[205:04.62]Now this guy has more money than the bank across the street.
[205:07.38]We're going to get it back and hold him.
[205:24.92]Okay.
[205:26.62]I have an opportunity to get it.
[205:29.02]Let's just raise.
[205:29.74]Let's just raise a thousand right off the bat.
[205:32.79]Where'd a poor looking cowboy like you get that kind of money?
[205:37.45]This guy got it, man.
[205:40.76]Ooh, I just lost everything.
[205:48.90]I thought you were bluffing, cowboy.
[205:51.01]But you really are bad.
[205:58.24]Okay, but who- who- that guy is not at the table and he keeps showing up putting a gun to people's heads.
[206:06.40]That's the second instance of that guy pointing a gun at somebody's head.
[206:08.88]He's not even at the table.
[206:10.34]He's just an NPC.
[206:13.11]Uh, what do I do?
[206:16.21]Can I not participate?
[206:17.97]Oh, it reset everybody's money.
[206:31.71]I think perhaps the distraction of the senorita has caused you to overbet your hand, amigo.
[206:37.63]Didn't he just do the same thing?
[206:39.61]He just did the exact same thing.
[206:42.08]He did the same exact thing.
[206:45.52]Alright, this is 12,000.
[206:48.98]Raise again.
[206:52.18]Who cares?
[206:59.24]I love this guy.
[206:59.64]I want this guy to have his own spin-off series.
[207:01.21]Alright, this is 20,000.
[207:04.03]What the fuck?
[207:04.39]That guy had a whole deck.
[207:24.69]How did I lose already?
[207:26.05]What?
[207:26.37]Oh, he lost everything too.
[207:27.43]Everybody lost everything.
[207:28.81]There's one guy over here.
[207:29.87]How did he win?
[207:30.27]Wait, what?
[207:30.57]I'm so happy I could kiss a goat square.
[207:43.28]That kind of sounds like Wario.
[207:45.54]Alright, one more five card draw and I'm good.
[207:56.79]Well, that's not great or whatever.
[207:59.69]All players passed.
[208:11.69]Ooh, I don't have enough money to raise.
[208:14.69]I have to fold because I don't have any money.
[208:16.17]I think I broke the game.
[208:22.32]I want to go back.
[208:22.86]How do I go?
[208:23.30]How do I get out of here?

[210:15.52]This is kind of terrifying.
[210:36.19]Damn.
[210:50.06]I'm looking forward to the music app.
[210:52.22]Yeah, this is before apps, by the way.
[210:57.44]Back in the day, we had to put a CD in a tray to get access to apps.
[211:06.28]I love the royalty-free version of this song.
[211:09.40]Um, it's one that, what does it say?
[211:10.66]It's... Isn't this the Space Jam song?
[211:18.31]No, it's, um... It's so royalty-free that it's erasing the real song.
[211:23.63]I can't even think of it.
[211:25.37]That's what it is.
[211:35.89]Okay.

[213:35.54]I didn't mean to put... Okay, that looks strange.
[213:39.50]Whoa.
[213:43.88]I just didn't want to have the animals having sex with each other.
[213:47.56]That's not what my intention was.
[213:51.78]Okay, this is so cool.
[214:09.73]There's so many more.
[214:10.89]Look at how many more there are.

[238:02.33]No, take that off.
[238:04.49]Take that off.
[238:15.22]This is the intro.
[238:39.96]I want it on this line right here.
[238:40.86]Okay.
[239:09.71]let's listen to it back for a sec okay starts pretty good
[239:48.86]This is the bass line.
[239:56.42]Okay.
[240:05.85]What's it sound like?
[240:24.82]That sounds good.
[240:31.32]So it's also like dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[240:34.14]Oh, there's too many on that one.
[240:55.22]Final Fantasy type beat.
[240:58.94]Alright.
[240:59.88]We're cooking here.
[241:28.38]Okay.
[241:58.37]Then it goes into this shit.
[242:29.09]Oh
[243:14.49]This is the sound place when you get a bonus in a slot machine.
[243:44.12]Then people think it's over.
[244:06.14]Hold on.
[244:33.76]Uh, uh, uh.
[245:04.30]I'm trying to do Silent Night.

[246:03.78]How's the sound?
[246:12.91]That's way too fast.
[246:14.48]No, go back, go back.
[246:46.06]Alright, this is supposed to be Silent Night.
[246:51.44]Right here.
[247:18.27]Yay!
[247:27.81]Yay!
[247:30.62]Everybody has to clap for the seven-year-old concert.
[247:34.42]Everybody has to clap for the six-year-olds.
[247:36.22]You can't boo the six-year-old concert, even if it was fucking terrible.
[247:42.53]Now let's add a little bit of flair on that.
[247:47.29]Wait.
[247:49.35]Wait, what's- What happened to my song?! !
[248:23.63]Alright, where's my song?
[248:26.73]I wanted to put a beat on it.
[248:52.97]Oh God.
[249:09.77]Did I overwrite my song?
[249:11.05]Where's my song?
[249:30.84]That's a lot of sound effects.
[249:33.53]Alright, I wanna see you.
[249:40.67]Stop it!
[250:01.03]Thank you.
[250:17.91]Oh
[251:07.91]No!
[251:09.07]I had so much spit in my mouth.
[251:10.85]I screamed and it came out through a filter.
[251:18.51]Alright, alright, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
[251:44.61]Damn.
[252:01.67]Exit.
[252:03.25]OK, my head hurts.
[252:05.95]What else we got?
[252:17.60]There's this.
[252:18.22]The amazing adventures of Max and Maxine.
[252:38.07]Okay.
[252:47.04]The jungle.
[252:47.54]This is just a game.
[252:54.34]What's wrong with me?
[252:55.44]I'm already dead?
[253:02.34]Oh, does that mean I can kill things?
[253:06.60]It does.
[253:06.94]It is just back, man.
[253:19.48]Okay, level two.
[253:20.44]Oh, come on.
[253:53.05]Okay, is that it?
[253:55.31]Oh my god, why didn't you start with that?
[253:57.25]That was so much cooler.
[253:58.27]Okay.
[254:08.29]I'm surprised there's so much of this on here.
[254:09.73]Like 10 games in one.
[254:21.41]Okay, what's this?
[254:23.01]Space Cadet.
[254:25.61]Another game?
[254:26.13]Another mini game?
[254:44.64]Space Cadet.
[254:46.06]It's another mini game.
[254:48.46]Level one.
[254:54.39]Nope.
[254:55.45]No, I'm not doing that.
[254:57.03]I'm sorry.
[254:57.41]We ain't going to look at that.
[255:12.36]No, I ain't putting up with it.
[255:13.67]I ain't doing the flashing.
[255:16.17]It's not going to happen.
[255:19.25]It already happened once in this game.
[255:20.69]I ain't going to do it again.
[255:32.21]Aqua shark.
[255:40.32]It's got pretty good graphics.
[255:47.98]Oh.
[255:51.52]This is actually kind of good.
[255:59.31]Whoa, that's a bomb.
[256:03.54]How many times can I do that?
[256:09.67]Rapid fire.
[256:18.14]Look like a lobster.
[256:35.39]Alright.
[256:37.27]I'm feeling this one.
[256:48.22]Oh, whoa, easy.
[257:21.09]More difficult.
[257:22.45]Ow.
[257:24.89]Awesome.
[257:25.25]This is actually kind of well made for it being on a painting and music making game.
[257:33.70]I would have been so happy if I got this at Christmas.
[257:38.82]This would have been great.
[258:01.53]There's only one more activity to do on this and then... There's another maybe one or two I want to play today.
[258:12.75]I'm holding back on another great one.
[258:14.07]I want to keep that for a third day.
[258:28.43]Alright, you get the gist of it.
[258:29.55]That was pretty sick.
[258:46.84]Alright, what is the final minigame?
[258:55.32]So this one's for little kids.
[259:02.52]Should be very, very good for me.
[259:11.83]Is it just bigger?
[259:12.41]I think the... I think it's just bigger.
[259:31.30]Is that all it's doing is making it bigger?
[259:32.98]OK, well, that's not cool.
[260:03.35]cool alright well that's fun I would say that was a good one that was lovely the only thing I didn't like about that was the uh flashing of the screen but it's okay it was only doing it only happened for like two or three seconds uh that was a good one that was fun in games and it was brilliant
[260:29.40]I want to play.
[260:30.16]Do I get this one started now?
[260:33.50]I feel like this is going to take a while.
[260:41.02]Maybe.
[260:42.10]I feel like I want that one on a fresh day.
[260:48.00]Let me go pee one more time and we'll come back and we'll do one or two more.
[260:52.84]Be right back.
[268:32.85]Okay, I'm back.
[268:35.27]We'll do one more.
[268:35.87]I'm going to do star control two.
[268:40.73]Not to be confused with star control one.
[268:42.33]I don't have that.
[268:45.78]There's still about... Let's see.
[268:48.16]I got one, two, three, four, five.
[268:51.28]I've got like seven more 3DO games.
[268:56.75]So what probably will happen is we'll do this and then...
[269:05.84]If it doesn't take the next time I stream, if it takes less than, you know, a couple hours to go through the last of it, just do something else for the remaining time.
[269:14.61]Alright.
[269:16.75]Star control two.
[269:18.18]And this is where we're going to end.
[269:35.11]People are saying this one's a good one.
[269:39.01]This is a good one?
[269:50.38]This game is a huge RPG, by the way.
[269:53.98]This is free on Steam.
[269:55.60]Wait, what?
[270:07.67]Is this a huge game?
[270:08.65]This is like on Steam right now?
[270:10.31]I mean, I could pivot to the Panasonic sampler CD.
[270:16.36]Who knows what the hell's on that?
[270:19.16]We'll see.
[270:22.08]You can imagine... Imagine in like a hundred years when that's gonna be their year.
[270:35.97]The streamer is so post-ironic.
[270:37.66]I know, I just flipped my hair up with my right hand.
[271:01.61]Everything has to be ironic.
[271:02.73]Nothing can ever be taken seriously.
[271:03.93]I have to just make a kind of an ironic joke about everything.
[271:07.95]Except for Diablo II, because it's the only fucking thing I like.
[271:10.47]Looks pretty good, actually.
[271:29.54]But then, far across space, an amazing discovery was made deep beneath the surface of an alien world.
[271:43.59]An underground city filled with the technological wonders of the precursors.
[271:49.45]Whoa, that looks pretty sick.
[271:50.31]Ancient and powerful race who vanished thousands of centuries ago.
[271:56.57]But the Oroquan swept through the nearby stars, stranding our scientific team here.
[272:05.12]Twenty years have passed.
[272:08.00]We have continued our research.
[272:10.18]We now know what the precursors built here.
[272:13.98]It is a factory.
[272:15.67]A factory for building starships.
[272:20.13]Alright.
[272:51.24]Super Melee?
[272:52.24]I wonder what that is.
[272:55.43]Okay, I have 10 fuel, 50 crew.
[273:03.07]I'm navigating right now to... Oh wait, is that me?
[273:10.34]I'm not going to crash, am I?
[273:14.02]Do I go to this red planet?
[273:21.07]What planet should I go to?
[273:22.17]Alright, I'm gonna go to the moon of this planet.
[273:34.44]What is this?
[273:50.65]Sol, Saturn.
[273:52.23]Let's scan it.
[273:54.05]Titan.
[273:55.39]Auto-scan.
[273:56.85]Scanning for minerals.
[273:58.51]There's some stuff on here.
[273:59.35]Okay, lander.
[274:04.62]Let's land.
[274:05.94]Gonna land right here.
[274:06.62]Oh shit, can I get the minerals?
[274:15.58]12 calcium?
[274:17.84]Alright, this calcium... I can shoot.
[274:22.34]Ow.
[274:22.96]Barium?
[274:25.62]I have nine fuel.
[274:27.92]Okay, people are dying on the ship.
[274:30.06]Alright, get me out.
[274:33.66]Wait, I got some stuff.
[274:40.03]Can I sell that stuff?
[274:45.31]What's this?
[274:52.43]Cool.
[274:52.87]Okay, what's on this?
[274:56.99]Nothing?
[275:01.05]Devices?
[275:02.41]Cargo?
[275:04.07]Oh man, this is like, I think you sell shit.
[275:09.77]I can't scan.
[275:13.30]Go to Earth?
[275:23.04]Oh my god.
[275:24.44]This is crazy.
[275:27.14]It's all in the game?
[275:38.64]Am I going sun?
[275:43.65]What is this place?
[275:47.82]It's a massive game.
[275:48.78]It's very influential.
[275:49.90]I mean, I see that.
[275:54.30]Okay, this is... Mercury.
[276:03.03]Lots of minerals.
[276:08.49]Okay, let's get some minerals.
[276:10.33]And land right there.
[276:11.43]Uranium.
[276:21.91]I could see dumping 10,000 hours in this game on my MS-DOS.
[276:26.47]Uh-oh.
[276:29.61]What does that mean?
[276:32.95]What was that?
[276:43.34]Why can't I pick this up?
[276:44.20]Okay, I didn't want to leave, but I left.
[276:45.64]Alright, where's Earth?
[276:51.31]Where's the star?
[276:51.81]Let me see.
[276:52.13]Where's the Milky Way?
[277:05.13]Where's Earth?
[277:08.75]It's blue.
[277:15.67]You're right.
[277:16.43]You're in our solar system.
[277:18.07]I am?
[277:18.35]Oh, I guess that's right.
[277:20.65]This is Mercury.
[277:23.97]You're right next to it.
[277:25.47]Wait, what do you mean?
[277:26.55]I thought Earth was across the whole galaxy.
[277:28.03]What are you talking about?
[277:31.56]Do you guys think there's another Earth?
[277:37.42]In our observable galaxy?
[277:38.74]Don't you think they're crazy?
[277:40.08]Uh-oh, what's this?
[277:46.97]attention interloper heed this recorded message this drone vessel speaks with the voice and authority of irkwan you are trespassing within irkwan space may not be approached for any reason
[278:09.95]nor will hostilities against our orbital platform be tolerated.
[278:16.47]In addition, your ship does not respond to standard hierarchy identification transmissions, and is therefore deemed to be independent.
[278:31.86]This is not permissible.
[278:34.68]Only subservience shall be tolerated.
[278:38.86]This drone now leaves to inform the Urquan of your transgressions.
[278:46.24]You are commanded to remain here and await the arrival of the Urquan.
[278:54.63]Disobedience will be punished.
[278:59.09]And then I lean down, I flip that switch, flip a couple switches above my head, there's one over the overhead, I flip it, and I start saying...
[279:05.22]Well, man, that's a whole lot of words to say that we're about to be vaporized.
[279:10.54]Because the movie's funny and I'm a character that you are going to think is cool.
[279:15.48]And I don't give a fuck.
[279:17.00]And I'm like funny and weird and kind of a rebel.
[279:22.52]And then we vaporize that person and the opening song starts playing.
[279:27.64]And people get that I am cool.
[279:33.50]You have to make sure you flip at least one switch over your head.
[279:37.48]Doesn't even matter what it is.
[279:38.19]It could be the sunroof.
[279:39.75]You have to look up.
[279:40.59]Yeah, well, that's it.
[279:41.53]Flick.
[279:43.35]It doesn't matter what it is.
[279:45.39]Especially when you're saying, well, that's a... Like, flick, well, that's a lot of ways to say.
[279:49.23]Can I land on this planet, please?
[279:56.69]What happened to Earth?! !
[280:15.66]Attention unidentified space vessel.
[280:18.04]I am Starbase Commander Hayes of the slave planet Earth.
[280:20.76]Alright, no more flashing colors.
[280:23.50]Extremely weak.
[280:24.86]Situation critical.
[280:26.18]Why is it doing this?
[280:28.16]I can't even look at this.
[280:31.74]We cannot identify your vessel.
[280:34.80]Are you the scheduled hierarchy resupply ship?
[280:37.35]Why is it doing this?
[280:39.07]Are you the resupply vessel?
[280:41.39]Why are you having a rave?
[280:47.01]uh okay we are ready to transfer radioactives we're initiating transfer of radioactives captain now as soon as our engineers can refit the energy cores there that's much better power ratings are climbing life support is coming back into the green deep radar systems and sensors are now online and I can scan your vessel what the hell kind of ship is that this one's not bright so it doesn't hurt as much who are you captain
[281:13.78]I am Captain Zelnick of the starship Vindicator.
[281:16.79]We are the survivors of a star control science research team to the Velostar system.
[281:23.29]Hey, I'm gonna need you to explain a few things.
[281:25.13]Okay, what do you want to know?
[281:27.19]First of all, uh, click.
[281:29.49]Uh, let me look above me.
[281:31.17]That's a whole lot of ways to say that we're about to be a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-
[281:40.20]What's the purpose of your Starburst?
[281:54.87]When the Alliance lost the war, the Irquan gave Earth a single choice.
[281:58.97]Join the hierarchy as battle thralls and fight for the Irquan to enslave other sentient species or become fallow slaves and be forever imprisoned on a single world encased in an impenetrable energy shield here on Earth.
[282:13.31]We choose not to fight for the Irquan.
[282:16.49]What the heck?
[282:18.75]Soon after the Earth accepted the Irquan's oath of fealty, they departed, leaving behind a battle group of Spathy and Ilrath ships based on the moon.
[282:31.60]Star Control science mission, huh?
[282:34.66]Captain, I served as a Star Control officer during the war aboard several cruisers in the Corwood Front.
[282:40.98]And if there'd been any scientific mission to Vela, I would have heard about it.
[282:45.80]Hmm... Our mission was highly secret.
[282:49.32]Okay.
[282:50.32]Hmm...
[283:18.11]We have returned to Earth to give you the technological secrets of the Precursors, and to help you fight higher.
[283:24.76]Ah, fight the Iroquois.
[283:26.42]Win back our freedom.
[283:27.90]I remember having such thoughts myself once, a long time ago.
[283:31.68]That was in the first years after the defeat, when it was still terrifying to look up and see the bloody glow of the pulsating slave shield overhead.
[283:38.38]Though day and night we gazed up at the impenetrable wall, as though the sheer power of our hatred would pull it down.
[283:46.79]I'm not bored!
[283:47.25]You guys keep projecting this onto me.
[283:49.02]Just because you're bored and you want me to be bored.
[283:51.00]Well, I'm not and I'm listening.
[284:16.21]and reassemble the alliance to attack the hierarchy.
[284:20.00]This time, win the damn war.
[284:23.06]Consider the consequences if you should fail.
[284:25.00]The Urquan won't just punish us here on the station, they'll exact a gruesome retribution on the surface below as well.
[284:32.54]Before I commit the station to helping you attack the Urquan and accepting the risk of annihilation if we are defeated, I have to make sure that you and your ship have what it takes to oppose the hierarchy.
[284:44.89]All I need...
[284:46.40]If you can eliminate the alien base on the moon and get rid of that planet at least, I will seriously consider your offer.
[284:54.38]Just give me two cans of cream of mushroom soup.
[284:57.34]Give me one laser weapon that has at least 20 to 30 shots in it.
[285:03.57]A rock that I can hold as big as a baseball in my hand.
[285:08.49]And I think I'll do it.
[285:13.17]I think I'll be able to do it.
[285:15.87]Alright, we're gonna go neutralize that face on the moon.
[285:17.82]I'm gonna use diplomacy.
[285:18.76]Alright, let's go fuck him up.
[285:47.01]What are you doing on the moon?
[285:49.07]You should be... You should be enslaved as are alien enslaved.
[286:01.66]I got knife fuel.
[286:02.22]Alright, so go destroy everything.
[286:08.26]Alright, let's go.
[286:14.78]Alright.
[286:17.56]Take their resources too.
[286:18.56]These are our resources.
[286:19.60]They stole them from us.
[286:43.17]And a lot of good stuff.
[286:46.82]Okay, there's only two people left.
[287:02.45]Why are there only 27 people in the crew?
[287:04.01]Yeah, what?
[287:05.46]What happened?
[287:05.82]Alright, I'm good.
[287:13.72]I got all of our resources back.
[287:19.60]Now... Now what?
[287:22.70]Oh, there's the base.
[287:23.28]Oh, shit.
[287:28.76]Okay, life support is functioning.
[287:31.12]Okay.
[287:51.68]I'll just blow it up.
[287:55.47]We can't translate this message.
[287:56.55]Our Xenotech Ensign Rigby believes the message is some kind of alert or mayday broadcast.
[288:04.29]The base is filled with useful materials and equipment.
[288:07.18]We will scavenge as much as we can and bring it aboard immediately.
[288:10.74]Whoa.
[288:13.60]Okay.
[288:15.86]Now let's go back.
[288:16.75]Look what I did.
[288:24.85]Is this really 3DO?
[288:25.88]It is really 3DO.
[288:26.58]I did.
[288:34.87]He made that up.
[289:04.66]Ah, yes, Earthlings.
[289:06.48]The affected breath of the Dark Twin Kazon.
[289:10.40]A human in an alien starship.
[289:13.08]How fascinating.
[289:16.12]When I intercepted that Urquan drone and learned that an unidentified starship had approached Earth, I never expected to find such a remarkable vehicle in the hands of a human.
[289:31.49]Top thing over here?
[289:54.11]Click the thing on that, but reach down into like where the glove box is.
[289:56.46]Okay, reach.
[289:57.02]Okay, nothing.
[289:58.14]Hey.
[290:00.64]Hey.
[290:03.22]Yeah, that's like, you're breaking up a little bit here, but I just gotta tell you one quick thing.
[290:08.22]Hey, if you're as ugly as they come, then you're as ugly as they come.
[290:11.56]Click.
[290:12.22]Overhead.
[290:12.62]Okay.
[290:13.50]Surrender.
[290:13.98]It's time to kill you.
[290:14.71]Cool.
[290:16.15]As alien as your ship may be, our sensors reveal how few weapons you have on board.
[290:23.06]Though this vessel is under-crewed and our cloak of darkness is non-functional, we still have more than enough power to kill you all.
[290:34.65]Stop that.
[290:35.41]No, I'm not going to.
[290:36.57]Okay.
[290:41.03]Time to fight.
[290:47.89]Where am I?
[290:49.42]What?
[290:49.72]What happened?
[290:50.96]What is this?
[290:51.30]Is it me?
[290:52.64]Holy shit!
[290:53.39]I just did it!
[290:54.25]I didn't even do it!
[290:55.09]What happened?
[290:56.01]I'm so good at this game even though I do.
[290:58.91]That guy sucked.
[290:59.65]We definitely killed at least 10 people on the ship.
[291:02.39]Half of the crew was glued to the right side of the ship.
[291:18.21]That fight took 10 years?
[291:19.03]What?
[291:19.13]It took 10 years?
[291:19.79]We will proceed to kick some major alien butt.
[291:40.57]The new alliance of three stars, the Coord... the Co... Concordance?
[291:43.83]Can't read it.
[291:44.63]So it's not gonna be that one.
[291:45.49]The United Federation of Worlds!
[291:46.43]The Empire of Zelnick.
[292:16.18]He says it.
[292:16.52]Okay.
[292:37.52]I have good news to report, Captain.
[292:39.44]We have successfully integrated the precursor technology from your ship into our fabricator system, and as you can see, we've already begun minor repairs on your ship, patching up some of the micrometeorite holes.
[292:51.01]We noticed that your ship does not have an emergency warp escape unit, so our engineers rigged up some for you and each of your escorts.
[292:58.59]Now, you should be able to escape from a bad situation with the touch of a button.
[293:02.63]But there is a cost, however.
[293:04.42]The unit gulps up five fuel units each time your precursor ship uses it.
[293:09.18]Also, we now have a limited capacity to make modifications to your ship, to refine starship fuel, to build additional combat ships, and to train members of your crew of the flagship and any ships you acquire for your fleet.
[293:21.97]Captain, I know you're eager to get to work, so I'll be brief.
[293:25.14]If you have any questions, how this star base works, what resources we need, or just some background information on the galaxy, don't hesitate to ask.
[293:34.22]Okay.
[293:35.56]I am good.
[293:37.54]Boy, I have minerals.
[293:38.76]I do have a lot of stuff.
[293:39.56]Whoa.
[293:40.76]The more minerals you bring us, Captain, the faster we'll be able to tackle the Irkwan.
[293:45.10]Alright.
[293:45.36]Well, I got some more.
[293:48.37]Try to avoid getting gruesomely killed, Captain.
[293:51.75]okay alright now the the world is ooh outfit starship alright I need fuel I probably should get a lot of fuel this doesn't this seems like it's kind of cheap but maybe not 50 fuel 50 I'm gonna
[294:19.18]Alright, how about another crew pod?
[294:24.09]I just spent a lot.
[294:25.07]I spent way too much money.
[294:33.15]Oops.
[294:33.86]Is that bad?
[294:34.88]Games?
[294:35.38]Oh, save.
[294:35.82]Yeah, save it.
[294:36.68]Okay.
[294:48.08]Alright, well, how do I get more crew?
[294:53.98]Yes, Captain?
[294:54.68]Do you have any people I can... Bring back lots of minerals, Captain.
[295:06.89]Shipyard?
[295:10.25]OK, what does this mean?
[295:11.11]Fleet plus three.
[295:15.47]Oh, there we go.
[295:16.15]OK, yeah, I should get.
[295:16.73]Let's get like 60 people.
[295:20.59]7070 people.
[295:23.37]Alright, we're good.
[295:26.88]Alright, this part surveys right now.
[295:28.96]Where we go?
[295:29.28]What should I do?
[295:32.36]What should I do?
[295:37.64]Go to Pluto, OK?
[295:46.14]Is Pluto a planet, though?
[295:49.12]Where is Pluto?
[296:05.53]Pluto's far away, isn't it?
[296:09.91]That's Neptune.
[296:11.33]Well, I want to go to Neptune first.
[296:27.32]You can tell he's in a bad mood.
[296:29.62]Quite the contrary, actually.
[296:31.20]I feel great.
[296:36.86]Okay, so there's nothing here.
[296:37.69]What about on the Neptune's moon?
[296:49.57]Okay, scan it.
[296:52.22]Lots of minerals here.
[296:57.76]Let's pick it up.
[296:58.24]Let's get some shit.
[296:58.86]Yeah, let's get some stuff.
[297:05.64]Potassium.
[297:08.00]Titanium.
[297:09.48]Uh.
[297:10.16]Uranium.
[297:18.27]Uh.
[297:19.31]Uh.
[297:19.95]Uh.
[297:32.49]That's some good stuff.
[297:36.97]What are you doing?
[297:37.53]Um, the plan is to try to get rid of as many of you as possible.
[297:40.93]Okay.
[297:46.65]Here we go.
[297:53.50]Finally said it.
[297:55.24]Alright, where the hell is Pluto?
[297:58.22]It's all the way out.
[298:09.78]Where's Pluto?
[298:11.36]Is it the green one?
[298:15.28]Pluto's supposed to be small.
[298:26.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[298:27.64]Stop.
[298:33.06]Small, like your pee-pee.
[298:34.92]Okay.
[298:35.70]Ban that person for at least 10 minutes.
[298:39.90]Is this Pluto?
[298:50.71]This is Uranus.
[299:03.55]Wicked funny?
[299:04.25]It's wicked funny.
[299:07.15]I can't do anything on Uranus?
[299:10.35]I cannot.
[299:16.95]You're what?
[299:17.45]You're ANUS!
[299:19.93]You are... A-N-U-S.
[299:23.15]Uranus.
[299:31.77]Where's Pluto?
[299:37.26]Pluto!
[299:38.02]Oh, Pluto's pretty.
[299:40.02]Some minerals there.
[300:12.16]Ten so crystals?
[300:14.52]There's a base here, too.
[300:21.47]Whoa, what's that?
[300:24.17]Mayday from surface.
[300:25.41]We've come under fire from an alien vessel we found hiding on the surface of Pluto.
[300:30.15]Captain, they killed Kowalski, Fritz, Chin, O'Donnell, Luigi, and all three of the Lieberman triplets.
[300:39.94]Uh-oh.
[300:51.96]Okay, somebody remember this.
[301:22.24]Alright, write that down.
[301:50.87]Identify yourself or be- Hi friend, we come in peace.
[301:54.20]Don't kill us.
[301:55.24]You attacked our lander, killed our crew.
[301:57.00]Prepare to die.
[302:03.82]Don't kill us.
[302:05.71]Uh... Identify yourself or prepare to be destroyed.
[302:12.36]We would be greatly appreciative if you would please just go away and forget this
[302:33.65]Don't raise your voice at me.
[302:35.53]I'm one second away from flipping the switch overhead.
[302:55.78]We suggest you immediately perform whatever cultural practices you custom are doing your species does preceding death.
[303:03.81]Or de- Die, slug boy.
[303:10.72]most gracious destroyer.
[303:12.88]As is well known, before departing this mortal helix, all Spocky must complete the short, brilliant ritual of Waddiwaza to be assured of a secure afterlife.
[303:25.56]And, by allowing us to fulfill this requirement, you too shall be granted immortality in our beautiful afterworld, which is absolutely guaranteed to be free of similarly immortal monsters who
[303:40.00]Okay.
[303:45.31]You may begin your ritual and I- and if I might make a small suggestion be done in less than two minutes.
[303:51.91]Because I am compassionate you will not die until you have exhausted your usefulness.
[303:55.94]Enough of your slimy yammering.
[304:07.69]We fight.
[304:08.55]He already told us.
[304:09.39]Didn't he give us the coordinates?
[304:33.64]If you somehow survive my attack, I have one sincere hope.
[304:37.68]That you may soon be devoured slowly by an ugly, flat-toothed herbivore!
[304:47.69]Yeah, they call me... ...fucking Captain... ...Spinner.
[304:54.23]It don't fucking matter where I shoot, I always get my fucking prey!
[305:11.07]I don't know what that was supposed to mean, but it's okay.
[305:19.39]No, what the heck?
[305:20.01]No, you were supposed to befriend those aliens.
[305:21.85]No, no, no.
[305:24.49]What the heck?
[305:24.89]You're supposed to befriend them.
[305:35.70]This game is cool.
[305:36.30]I like it.
[305:40.31]Alright, what were those coordinates?
[305:49.79]Are there any of the planets I can go to here?
[305:57.73]I don't want to go to the sun.
[305:59.83]What about Venus or something?
[306:01.73]Oops.
[306:05.05]Mars?
[306:05.49]Is there anything on Mars?
[306:22.08]Okay.
[306:23.06]Oh, there's a lot of stuff on Mars.
[306:24.26]Go to Jupiter to get stupider.
[306:36.49]I'm going to deposit minerals after this.
[306:38.65]Okay.
[306:58.33]Doing a bathroom break?
[307:00.23]Uh, I'm doing a turn the stream off break pretty soon.
[307:05.07]Alright, let me deposit.
[307:22.42]I got a lot of stuff.
[307:30.09]I actually really like this game.
[307:34.29]Is it weird that I want to do like a whole stream on this?
[307:36.33]I think that'd be kind of fun.
[307:56.82]It's fun.
[307:57.18]It's a really good game.
[307:58.50]It feels like a really good game.
[308:05.50]Greetings, Captain.
[308:06.40]I'm ready to assist you.
[308:10.73]Minerals.
[308:13.41]Oh, wow.
[308:15.31]Load this time, Captain.
[308:18.23]Return soon.
[308:18.93]Yeah, OK.
[308:19.91]This is going to be I'm going to play this a full stream of this.
[308:23.61]It's very fun.
[308:24.07]Should I play it on the 3DO or is this on Steam?
[308:31.14]Maybe the Steam version is probably higher resolution.
[308:36.39]Yeah.
[308:36.69]Alright.
[308:37.87]Put this down for a higher resolution on PC.
[308:41.61]Yeah.
[308:42.41]Steam version is probably better.
[308:45.41]It's cleaner, but there's no voices.
[308:46.99]Wait, what?
[308:52.97]That's like one of the best parts.
[308:53.85]This video has better sound.
[308:56.79]Really?
[308:57.09]Okay.
[309:05.86]Uh, I'm gonna call it here.
[309:09.93]There's a version on PC that has the voices back?
[309:11.81]Okay, that's good.
[309:13.99]Well, that was really fun.
[309:16.21]Playing these old games.
[309:17.01]This video is amazing.
[309:21.30]I think that was like banger after banger.
[309:23.42]Those are all great.
[309:29.96]I'm probably gonna have the... I'll probably have the archive channel.
[309:32.44]Probably just send a ping.
[309:34.49]Just to warn people about the, uh... screen flashing of Fun and Games.
[309:40.17]Probably... I'm sure they have a timestamp for it.
[309:42.63]That was pretty bad, but besides that, it was great.
[309:52.39]The Olympics one was kind of lame, but everything else was fun.
[309:55.33]I think the Olympics one was lame only because we had to sit there and wash all the other countries.
[310:03.31]But I loved everything else about it.
[310:19.14]Alright, yeah, that's it.
[310:20.70]I will see you guys.
[310:21.74]Hey, hey, have a great Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.
[310:23.70]Those of you that are celebrating Thanksgiving tomorrow.
[310:28.24]Go eat some good food.
[310:29.02]I'll give you a quick, hey, you want a tip?
[310:32.39]Listen to this.
[310:34.95]So here's a, you know what I've been doing?
[310:37.55]Ollie and I have been doing this.
[310:40.05]We've been, it's like speed run Thanksgiving.
[310:46.63]You might think I'm a weirdo, but it's whatever.
[310:47.87]This is my speedrun Thanksgiving strategy.
[310:50.82]You get the... So you just get like a, you know, like, it doesn't matter, whatever, the stuffing, like Stouffer stuffing.
[310:57.82]This is how I've been operating this Thanksgiving now, like the last, I would say last, this year.
[311:03.83]Fuck a whole turkey.
[311:15.68]Alright, bye.
[311:16.74]See... I fucking had a That's So Raven instantly.
[311:25.13]When I just said it, I just saw everybody in chat be like, What the fuck?
[311:30.47]What is he saying?
[311:31.49]I can't believe... It fucked up everything.
[311:33.21]I'm not even going to tell you anymore.
[311:34.27]It's over.
[311:34.61]That's all you need to know.
[311:36.26]Have a good Thanksgiving.
[311:37.16]See you later.

[311:54.11]Who cares what I eat on Thanksgiving?
[311:55.91]You're going to eat whatever you're going to eat.
[311:57.97]You like stuff.
[311:58.69]I like stuff.
[311:59.21]We all like different things.
[312:00.23]So who fucking cares?
[312:02.23]Well, what I do is I get instant potatoes and then I get gravy and then I make a sandwich.
[312:07.64]I don't even make an entire... You're going to do whatever you're going to do and I'm going to do what I'm going to do.
[312:16.32]Yeah, you like the green bean gross ass casserole with the fucking crispy onions on it.
[312:20.28]Actually kind of good if you make it right.
[312:36.27]Oh man, oh man.
[312:39.81]That's not my Thanksgiving secret.
[312:51.48]It doesn't matter how old I get.
[312:54.02]I will always fumble the fucking ball in the end zone.
[312:55.88]Doesn't matter what it is.
[312:57.82]I could be 40, I could be 50.
[312:59.38]I'm going to socially fumble the ball every opportunity.
[313:04.99]Whatever, it's all good.
[313:18.35]It's not even a big deal either.
[313:20.13]I don't fucking care.
[313:21.10]It's just... Alright, see you guys later.
[313:25.92]Have a good Thanksgiving.
