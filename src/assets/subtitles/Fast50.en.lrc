[00:00.35]If you guys are donating throughout this entire broadcast, we have our correspondent, our weatherman, who will be taking a look at your donos and taking a look at the weather.
[00:11.32]So let's cut over to our weatherman and see how he's doing.
[00:15.84]Appreciate it.
[00:16.38]Thank you, Ludwig.
[00:17.42]Yeah, we got quite a forecast here, the top donation forecast, if you're just curious, if you're just joining us.
[00:22.39]We had Prison Griff with $1,000, just by the way, $1,000 from Prison Griff, and Glorp with $500.
[00:28.91]I didn't even introduce myself.
[00:31.33]By the way, the station has heard your feedback about how my hair looks like a rat's nest.
[00:36.40]and how it looks like I haven't had sun in about three years.
[00:38.66]We take that feedback very seriously, so really appreciate it.
[00:41.50]Anyways, we've got, you'll be checking in with me every so often here.
[00:45.50]We'll go over the weather.
[00:46.64]We'll go over the top donators, as you see here.
[00:49.50]This is your forecast.
[00:50.64]I'll be here all weekend to help check back in with me.
[00:54.47]So let's check back in with you, Ludwig, and everybody else on the couch.
[00:59.51]Yeah, let's take a look at the leaderboard, just so you guys know right now.
[01:02.89]And to help us, we have our weatherman, Jerma.
[01:04.67]Jerma.
[01:05.94]I'm not really doing the weather right now, but I can step out of the way.
[01:09.93]Take a look here.
[01:10.45]Here's your leaderboard.
[01:11.71]Here is the challenge here.
[01:13.91]And look at that cloudy sky.
[01:15.64]Looks beautiful behind us.
[01:17.14]Looks great outside.
[01:19.24]I do get into the weather.
[01:20.40]I get into the weather.
[01:21.58]I'm sorry.
[01:22.53]I'll get out of the way.
[01:34.54]How's that for a fucking speed run?
[01:40.84]And back to you, couch!
[01:44.62]That was nice.
[01:45.28]Yeah.
[01:46.06]He's actually... He won a Weatherman competition in 2006.
[01:49.66]Really?
[01:49.96]Yeah, most accurate reports.
[01:51.94]You know, he was talking to me.
[01:53.16]Let's break the illusion here.
[01:54.56]He was very concerned because it is illegal to talk about the weather if it is not real.
[01:59.37]We have to get jermaOn the couch at some point.
[02:01.25]What?
[02:01.39]Because he...
[02:03.88]Supposedly, if you tell people that it's going to rain... It's going to snow in L.A.
[02:06.97]tomorrow.
[02:07.25]It's going to snow in L.A.
[02:08.11]Exactly.
[02:08.39]That's what he said.
[02:09.33]That's not allowed.
[02:10.55]No, you can't... Oh, no.
[02:12.65]See, now it's serious.
[02:14.87]I wasn't a part of this, okay?
[02:16.45]I'm sorry.
[02:17.09]My mic's on.
[02:17.47]Oh, your mic's on.
[02:18.03]You can't make a fake fucking weather report.
[02:20.62]Like, it's got to be real.
[02:22.62]So we're doing Mushroom Kingdom.
[02:24.12]We're not doing anything else.
[02:25.16]What do you mean?
[02:25.84]Like, weather report?
[02:26.50]I don't want a part of this.
[02:27.82]It has to be like official or can I just say-
[02:31.00]You can't say that Glendale's gonna have sunny weather tomorrow or they're gonna come in and SWAT him.
[02:34.00]Apparently you can't lie.
[02:36.00]Uh I mean he never lied to anyone.
[02:36.00]We got a few donos coming in, I'm gonna read them throughout the day.
[02:40.00]We got one from Mixua who dropped 50 bucks said: Hey Mr. Weatherman, you're gonna speedrun Bob the Builder? Can we fix it on the PS2 for a smiley face.
[02:48.00]Uh no, he's working. Right, he's at work right? It's a weatherman.
[02:50.00]It's crazy, I don't go to your place of business and heckle you. Ask you to speed run for me.
[03:16.86]We'll donate- oh my god 500 from Prison Griff. Whoa.
[03:20.00]We'll donate another 500 if Jerma does a shoey with some Red Bull. Okay Jesus - that's an ask.
[03:51.79]385 from Taylor TJ ayaya.
[03:59.37]And we are getting a rush of donations.
[04:02.59]So we got to head over to our weatherman to make sure we're keeping up with everything that we're getting.
[04:06.53]Weatherman, how are we doing?
[04:09.13]We're doing good.
[04:09.85]We're doing good.

[06:25.81]Can we cut over to our weatherman?
[06:28.03]See what we're dealing with?
[06:29.07]I mean, we have crazy weather.
[06:31.27]Absolutely unbelievable weather.
[06:33.12]Look, can we start on Friday?
[06:34.68]I'll start on Friday.

[06:36.68]We'll go backwards.
[06:37.74]So let me fix my microphone.
[06:39.28]There we go.
[06:39.60]That sounds better.
[06:40.36]So Friday, Glorp had $500.
[06:41.62]By the way, obp.gg slash donate.
[06:46.35]That's how you can donate and maybe appear on the top five DonoForecast.

[07:20.82]That's a lot of money.
[07:22.68]OBP.GG slash donate.
[07:26.20]Now, I do want to talk about a few things because we do have a little bit of Super Mario coming up and it can get a little chilly out there.
[07:33.73]So, two more runs of Mario coming up here, back to back here.
[07:36.95]Monday, this is your forecast, this is your whole weekly forecast for the Mushroom Kingdom.
[07:41.25]Gonna be a little, at 70s is room temp, so you don't need a jacket for that.
[07:45.48]But at nighttime, you see these things down here, that means it's gonna get nice and chilly.
[07:51.00]So you're gonna have to make sure you wear, Tuesday, we got double clouds on Tuesday, coming in Thursday, triple clouds.
[07:56.52]These ones have water in them, be careful, take an umbrella.
[07:59.60]Also Friday,
[08:01.34]Lightning storms on Friday, folks.
[08:03.50]Lightning storms on Friday.
[08:04.75]If you're going to be in a Mario Kart, I'm going to tell you right now, get those wheels checked.
[08:10.35]Saturday, where are we over here?
[08:11.61]Saturday, it's going to lighten up a little bit, get some overcast, guys.
[08:15.09]Watch this over here, though.
[08:17.59]Ow.
[08:18.99]71 degrees on Sunday, going into 59 overnight.
[08:22.03]We've got a 10 out of 11 of the UV index, by the way.
[08:24.56]If you've got an umbrella, please use it.
[08:26.34]And Parabomb alert, Parabomb alert, all you Mario Karters out there, be careful.
[08:31.29]and rollercoaster anybody want to go on a rollercoaster ride with me but I thought that I had a speed run for it but I think it's the wrong way but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but
[09:00.37]Nobody prepares you for the green screen.
[09:10.80]Get out of my way.
[09:13.14]Break the screen.
[09:18.30]There we go.
[09:20.45]That feels pretty good.
[09:21.91]That feels pretty good.
[09:22.99]This is not a roller coaster, by the way.
[09:25.45]This is a ski resort?
[09:28.57]What is this?
[09:31.41]This is a ski resort.
[09:32.53]Is it a roller coaster?
[09:35.45]It's an alpine.
[09:36.21]Have you ever been on an alpine sled?
[09:39.29]Have you been on one?
[09:42.19]Not once in my life.
[09:43.21]Also, by the way, it's funny because you were miming it, but you were leaning in the direction as if you have to do work.
[09:49.59]Like you're on the bobsled team.
[09:52.53]I was facing the wrong direction.
[09:54.59]But then when you were facing the right, you were like cool runnings.
[09:56.53]You had to lean into the turns.
[09:58.53]Alright, we'll do it again.
[09:59.56]Okay, okay.
[10:01.54]Alright.
[10:01.92]Big right turn coming up.
[10:03.82]Whoa.
[10:05.72]Oh, my God.
[10:06.76]The movement.
[10:07.86]Oh, my God.
[10:09.62]Whoa.
[10:10.64]God, I'm a damn athlete.
[10:13.38]I know he's not there, but I get scared.
[10:16.64]He, like, lifts up.
[10:18.40]Oh, my God.
[10:19.12]Dangerous.
[10:19.56]Dangerous.
[10:20.56]Nerva, please.
[10:24.05]How long is this?
[10:25.91]It's looped seven times.
[10:31.19]And that's your weather, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:32.71]Thank you for watching.
[10:33.89]We've got a lot of great runs.
[10:35.51]Stay tuned.
[10:38.33]What a weather, man.
[10:39.17]What a weather, man.
[10:40.37]I am a little nervous about the bombs.
[10:42.83]Yeah, the bomb rain.
[10:44.83]It's going to be a bombing of Mushroom Kingdom.
[10:46.88]But I'm more worried about the UV index, 10 out of 11.
[10:49.16]That is high.
[10:50.80]That is like you don't, sunscreen doesn't even cut it for that.
[10:53.80]I got melanin.
[10:54.64]By the way, sunscreen isn't real.
[10:57.26]Anyway, our next run is Super Mario Maker 2.
[11:41.98]Let's see Jerma versus Ludd, Luddioff.
[11:44.81]I think we have Sekiro later tonight too.
[11:46.57]Yes, that's going to be an amazing run.
[11:48.41]I was actually just talking to Jerma in the hallway and he's like, actually, can I get on the couch for that one?
[11:51.42]I would love to see that.
[11:52.48]It was great.
[12:16.68]Thank you.
[13:54.26]And are we headed right to?
[13:56.04]We're doing a break?
[14:00.21]Because I think I need a little break.
[14:03.41]I understand.
[14:04.79]If you guys don't mind, I need to lie down.
[14:06.84]Well, he did just use like 20 beds back to back.
[14:09.04]Well, I'm going to go to bed.
[14:10.82]That was a lot.
[14:12.10]If you don't mind, I'll let you guys fill.
[14:13.80]I'll wake up.
[14:14.32]I'll be back in the morning.
[14:19.98]Okay.
[14:21.50]This isn't a bed.
[14:22.20]He's going to bed.
[14:25.17]He is in fact walking over to bed.
[14:26.97]He's going to sleep.
[14:27.67]Good night.
[14:28.07]Can you hear me?
[14:34.16]You guys can all watch me sleep.
[14:36.28]I'm going to be sleeping on the stream.
[14:38.44]It'll be nice and cozy.
[14:40.34]So you guys can tell them what's happening next.
[14:45.25]You guys know what's happening next, right?
[14:46.57]He's going to sleep.
[14:47.46]He's going to sleep.
[14:48.82]Monkey ball.
[14:49.54]Woo!
[14:50.06]It's just about going to bed.
[14:59.15]You going to bed?
[14:59.85]Yeah, I was planning on.
[15:01.31]God, I've been under here for a while.
[15:03.59]Let me.
[15:03.83]You've been under my bed for a while?
[15:05.93]What is this thing?
[15:07.75]Get out of here.
[15:08.95]What is this creature?
[15:09.87]Who are you?
[15:10.51]I'm the creature under the bed.
[15:12.42]That's right.
[15:13.08]Your name is the creature under the bed.
[15:14.34]That's the creature under the bed.
[15:15.44]You got it.
[15:15.82]You got a better name.
[15:17.28]Let me reach.
[15:18.12]Where are you?
[15:18.66]I'm right here.
[15:19.12]I'm right here.
[15:19.66]Give me that fucking mic.
[15:20.90]You want my microphone?
[15:23.23]Yeah, actually, I already am mic'd up.
[15:26.31]I've been mic'd up the whole time, actually.
[15:29.76]Hey, can I tell you something?
[15:34.38]You ever seen this game before?
[15:37.92]That's Donkey Kong Jungle Beat.
[15:41.64]I got a three hour and 45 minute time on that game.
[15:44.52]What do you think I've been doing down there?
[15:47.64]I don't know.
[15:48.10]I don't know what you do down there.
[15:49.78]Can you play?
[15:50.50]You want me
[15:53.10]It's hard to get both arms up here.
[15:54.70]You want to get both?
[15:55.42]Get your hands in.
[15:56.18]Okay, ready?
[15:58.10]You've got to moisturize.
[16:00.92]Hey!
[16:01.20]Sorry, sorry.
[16:01.98]Ready?
[16:02.34]Check this out.
[16:02.90]Yeah.
[16:06.92]That's worth a speed run!
[16:08.00]I'm crazy!
[16:09.02]Hey, so you're going to bed?
[16:10.22]I was going to bed, yeah.
[16:11.26]Hey!
[16:12.71]It sounds like somebody just needs a little bit of a pick-me-up.
[16:16.03]How does that sound?
[16:17.53]Let me hold it.
[16:18.55]I don't just take it from me.
[16:19.85]Okay.
[16:20.85]That's a Red Bull.
[16:22.43]Is that for me?
[16:23.13]And that's a sugar-free.
[16:24.75]And you like sugar-free, that's what I heard.
[16:27.57]Oh, wait.
[16:30.04]Oh, that's great.
[16:30.68]Can I?
[16:31.32]That's great for the family.
[16:32.20]Can I try that?
[16:33.12]Yo, what happened here today?
[16:35.56]Ooh.
[16:36.12]Man.
[16:36.84]That's smooth.
[16:37.76]Yeah, have a sip.
[16:38.82]You can take it back.
[16:39.42]That's not bad.
[16:40.32]Alright, well, you know what?
[16:42.24]I'll stay up for another hour, creature.
[16:43.34]Wait, no.
[16:43.72]You've got to stay up way longer than an hour.
[16:45.36]How long do I have to stay up?
[16:46.77]I don't know.
[16:47.31]An hour and a half?
[16:48.03]Okay.
[16:48.27]Yeah, it works for me.
[16:49.27]Give me my jungle, bitch.
[16:50.55]Take your jungle.
[16:52.95]I'll be under the bed here for the next 16 hours.
[16:55.17]Is a three-hour time even good?
[16:56.95]Now, I believe we should have an update from our weatherman.
[17:00.31]Weatherman Jerma, how are we doing?
[17:01.84]Oh.
[17:02.92]It's Sash.

[19:28.75]$10 from Slacebo.
[19:30.45]Phoenix Bojangles, $100.
[19:32.01]Imagine this is the weather.
[19:37.67]Hey, let's take a look at what the studio brought in, the weather station.
[19:42.49]This is a position a weatherman should never be in, by the way.
[19:45.47]We got another 20 from Mark.
[19:48.15]Nice.
[19:50.28]Yeah, again, 38.30 is your top here.
[19:52.70]Logan Ripley, thank you so much.
[19:54.35]Very generous of you.
[19:55.85]So now let's, hey, hey, we got more runs, right?
[19:59.11]Couch.
[20:00.35]Yeah.
[20:00.79]Hey, guess what?
[20:01.93]Hey, guess what?
[20:02.69]I'm going to be on that.
[20:04.05]Hey, guess what?
[20:04.63]I'm going to be on that couch later.
[20:07.67]Did I just point at the wrong camera twice?
[20:12.62]Back to you guys.
[20:14.26]And that was our weatherman update.
[20:16.60]What a nice guy.
[20:18.68]What a soul.
[20:19.52]I don't think he knows what a high pressure situation is in terms of weather.
[20:24.04]Not at all.
[20:25.11]But he does in terms of gaming.
[20:26.71]I love the sign that just says him only.
[20:29.95]That's actually where they contain him.
[20:34.55]Yeah, that's where he lives.
[20:36.61]I feel like there's new names on that leaderboard.
[20:39.55]Yeah, there were the times definitely because before I remember there was some that were north of 30 and little Aggie was fifth or fourth.
[20:45.56]He's eighth now.
[20:46.78]Yeah.
[20:47.32]Little Aggie losing money being here.
[20:48.92]Drama.
[20:50.60]I left him.
[20:51.22]He just told you that.
[20:53.00]Yeah.
[20:53.32]He's like, he's out in the wild.
[20:54.68]I'm an escapee.
[20:55.52]The T-Rex gets out in San Diego.
[22:22.45]Isolated in the schedule to be able to get all the cam and stuff ready.
[22:28.20]And then that's what it will be.
[22:30.50]It's worth the wait.
[22:31.36]It's worth the wait.
[22:32.04]You're not going anywhere.
[22:34.26]And speaking of worth the wait, while we wait for this game to get pulled up, all the settings figured out, I'm hearing there's some dangerous weather alerts over in the lands in between.
[22:42.81]Let's go to our weatherman and see how things are going.
[22:46.09]Yeah, we do have some danger.
[22:47.73]I've got a little bit of a problem here.
[22:49.29]Hold on.
[22:51.07]I screwed this whole thing up.
[22:52.07]Let me just move this.
[22:54.53]Yeah, alright, so we do have a little bit of weather.
[22:55.83]I'll get to that in a second, but I do want to update you all on the top five leaderboard here for the donations.
[23:01.52]Logan Ripley still in the lead at 3830.
[23:04.82]3000 from Prison Gryph.
[23:07.85]It's not a lead, by the way, but these are the people that are at the top right now.
[23:12.19]David Cockrings is still just sitting in the same spot.
[23:15.86]right here with his $2,150.
[23:18.80]Thank you, David Cockerings.
[23:20.39]Ludwig, $1,500 from Ludwig.
[23:24.39]Would you look at that?
[23:25.83]And then FT Hatzla?
[23:29.25]F that Tesla.
[23:30.25]F that Tesla.
[23:31.59]Fat Tesla?
[23:33.29]F that.
[23:33.97]Like F that.
[23:35.37]F that Tesla with $1,250.
[23:38.58]Very much appreciated.
[23:39.86]OBP.GG slash donate is where you go to do this.
[23:43.84]Now...
[23:44.82]I do want to talk about a little bit of weather here because we're doing Elden Ring.
[23:48.22]I have heard some reports, we'll get the map up here, heard some reports of showers that are going to be over Limgrave and over Caelid, so your commute here is going to be pretty difficult from Caelid all the way to Limgrave.
[23:58.59]I recommend you take the teleporter that is down here to avoid all of this situation.
[24:03.52]Also, we're going to be recommending the Carrion Knight set.
[24:06.08]which is down here for the weather, so the rain can fall off of you.
[24:09.16]Once you get up Alta's Plateau, you're going to see it's going to clear up a little bit here.
[24:13.00]By the way, for those of you that have played this game for less than 15 minutes, I apologize, we've shown you the whole world.
[24:20.15]Just to give you a little bit of an idea, all you need to worry about is this little section right here.
[24:25.21]And then at about noon today, this is going to be a little bit darker here.
[24:30.17]It gets dark in Limgrave very, very early.
[24:32.85]So yeah, there's your weather report.
[24:34.82]Good luck to the runners, and let's keep it rolling.
[24:38.14]Thank you, too.
[24:38.96]Oh.
[24:39.40]Oh, my god.
[24:41.24]He's a brisk little fellow.
[24:42.38]One of the fastest men alive.
[24:43.56]Is that true?
[24:44.44]It is true.
[24:45.14]It is true.
[24:46.64]Retired to become a weatherman.
[24:48.84]But wow, what a report.
[24:52.47]What a report.
[24:53.21]I really like the effort to put in the carrying night set.
[24:57.25]Somebody clearly does their research.
[24:59.05]That weatherman is crazy.
[25:01.71]He's nasty with it.
[25:02.65]When he's not covering weather, he's crushing through the lands in between.
[25:05.98]Him and his little snake buddy.
[25:09.00]What's that guy's name?
[25:10.54]Bombo.
[25:11.92]You don't know about Jerma Bombo?
[25:14.58]Jombo?
[25:14.99]What's his name?
[25:15.45]Are you talking about Ster?
[25:17.37]No.
[25:18.77]Ask Jerma about it.
[25:20.30]Bombo Jumbo.
[25:21.11]He's got a little snake homie.
[25:23.69]He's got a little snake homie?
[25:25.18]Yeah, he's got a little snake buddy.
[25:27.12]Bombo Jumbo.
[25:27.97]Yeah.
[25:41.88]Thank you.
[26:07.02]Yeah, I kicked Ludwig off the couch.
[26:11.84]Where's Ludwig?
[26:14.34]I stole his seat.
[26:16.04]This was a really interesting concept to me.
[26:17.91]I wanted to get a front row seat for it.
[26:19.27]It's a blast.
[26:19.93]It's a blast.
[26:20.37]And if anybody has any questions at any time, Parky and I are more than happy to answer because Bingo is pretty...
[26:25.79]There's a lot going on.
[26:26.85]You talked about colossal checks.
[26:28.55]Are there certain places in the game where the weapon is replaced with a weapon of similar size and scale?
[26:35.52]Yeah, exactly.
[26:36.40]So, like, colossal armaments are their own weapon type.
[26:40.05]So, like, Troll's Hammer, the Troll's Golden Sword, these are all, like, colossal weapons, and they could all be where Kris found Falling Star Beasts, y'all.
[26:47.67]Right, so if you go fight Leonine, there will be a colossal weapon drop for sure, but it's not going to be the Grafted Greatsword.
[26:52.88]Well, I mean, maybe.
[26:53.80]I think for some of them, there's a small chance it can be the Vanilla weapon, but it's very rare.
[26:58.36]So Chris is over here.
[26:59.94]This is the Grace near Millenia, but he's obviously not fighting Millenia.
[27:02.22]He's actually going to pick up some runes to level up or get...
[27:05.63]his weapon upgraded or whatever he's working on here, but it is for the runes and just for setup.
[27:10.82]Yeah, he'll probably pick up the Somber 9 as well as there's a 50k rune drop here.
[27:14.54]He just has to be a little curious, curious, a little cautious about this Putrid Urchery Avatar as it will one-shot him for sure.
[27:23.15]Yeah.
[27:24.19]We do have some scary squares on the board here.
[27:26.75]We have Kill Astel and Astel, Stars of Darkness, which is, since we have this mod that opens graces and you don't have to do the whole Ronnie quest and all that, Astel and Astel, Stars of Darkness square is so fun to watch, in my opinion.
[27:38.31]It is such a brutal double boss situation, and so I hope they'll contest that one.
[27:45.01]So they don't know what any of these things, do they know what these are?
[27:48.34]They see the board.
[27:49.98]So they can see the board and they're making decisions actively based on it.
[27:53.50]Yes.
[27:53.86]So you don't know what your opponent's doing.
[27:55.94]Correct.
[27:56.32]But I'm going for the Sombra Plus right now.
[27:58.56]Exactly.
[27:59.41]With a rivalry this strong,
[28:01.67]It almost seems as if they knew what the other one was going to do.
[28:04.89]So that's what we were saying.
[28:05.87]Aggie and Chris have been playing against each other for years, and so they know what they like, and they know how each other plays, right?
[28:13.04]So it's easy to make choices based on that, but also kind of hard.
[28:16.50]Yeah, the sheer dichotomy of, like, Chris being like, okay, somber, and then Aggie almost instinctively going, oh, regular smithing.
[28:22.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:23.78]Yeah.
[28:26.22]Finish a boss with the explosive.
[28:28.14]That is a great one.
[28:30.34]You get the boss down to one health and then pray to God.
[28:35.20]And so you'll also see that a lot of these goals require several steps or you must do something else.
[28:41.44]And so looking for, like Tevin was saying earlier, synergy within goals because there are certain goals that are synergistic with others.
[28:48.21]And that is obviously good because if you can literally kill two birds with one stone, that's a huge win.
[28:53.71]So for example, we have here Killer, Remembrance Boss, Colossal Armament only, and we also have Killer, Remembrance Boss, Hit List.
[28:59.99]And most of the time, the big Elden Ring players will try and do squares like that at the same time.
[29:05.77]You know, you kill Godrick or something, you do a Hit List, you look like a badass, and you get two squares at once, you know, so...
[29:12.79]That's a big play.
[29:13.53]Stuff like that is very cool to see.
[29:15.29]Kill four bosses with the word God.
[29:17.15]Yeah, those are fun.
[29:19.63]There's some really creative squares on here that I really like.
[29:21.89]Yeah, this season of Bingo Brawlers introduced some really fun ones.
[29:28.12]There's some pretty fast squares on here too, like Sleeping Golem in Leyndell is pretty quick.
[29:32.34]Memory of Grace with 50k runes can be picked up in less than five minutes.
[29:35.86]The problem is you're throwing away 50k in cash.
[29:38.19]So let's explain what that is if people don't know.
[29:40.39]Yeah, so 50k runes, if you don't know, are sort of your currency in this game.
[29:44.09]They also allow you to level up.
[29:46.09]And with our late game graces, we can get a ton of cash early.
[29:49.21]The problem is you're trying to win in ideally like an hour or an hour and a half, and you need to be as beefed up as possible as quick as possible.
[29:57.87]So memory of Grace means you forfeit 50,000 runes for a square.
[30:02.25]So you get a square, but you lose a ton of leverage.
[30:05.85]So squares also have interesting little mind games like that.
[30:08.19]Those are often kind of chicken squares.
[30:09.53]There's some other squares that dump runes into stats and stuff like that, stats that you're not going to use.
[30:15.19]So those are often like chicken, like who's going to do it?
[30:17.96]Yeah, because nobody wants to.
[30:19.30]Yeah, no one wants to do those, unless you have a weapon that's kills with those stats or something.
[30:22.46]But we don't have that on the board here, so... Can we talk about what a square on one of these that would look relatively easy, like if thinking about it in a casual way, but actually requires a more difficult...
[30:36.42]Synergy-wise, you're giving up a lot to go in this direction.
[30:39.90]I'd like to bring up Mimic tier consumables only.
[30:43.64]Mimic tier is the boss you fight underground.
[30:46.01]It's the Mimic tier.
[30:47.13]It's the one who's just like you.
[30:48.09]So what they'll do is take all their clothes off, take all their weapons off and go into the fight.
[30:52.77]So that fight, if you do it just regular, you have throwing weapons or whatever, throwing consumables, it's actually really hard to do that because Mimic Tear, especially if you take all your clothes off so he doesn't do much damage to you, he is really agile and he'll do a lot of dodging and all that.
[31:08.54]So that's actually really, really hard and you're going to run out of consumables.
[31:12.99]So they actually do have a cheese, which is the Mimic Tear starts as a puddle and that's- we have allowed that.
[31:18.73]Uh where if you throw like a holy pot or something at the puddle it'll one-shot the puddle and then the boss will never spawn in.
[31:24.73]Right.
[31:25.73]So that actually counts for that um but if you did fight it the regular way it's pretty difficult I would say.
[31:31.00]It also like I think people think of Mimic Tear as such an easy fight, but even neglecting the fight itself there's a lot of requirements.
[31:40.00]Like you have to beat Radahn to open access to Nokron because we- there are some things we haven't opened up for free with the graces like:
[31:47.71]You still need to beat Radahn to get into Nokron.
[31:50.69]You still need to do certain things to access certain areas.
[31:53.69]So it's not like these graces have completely made the game like, oh, just go here, beat this boss.
[31:57.91]The similar situation with like Lamedale, yeah.
[32:00.33]Yeah, so the capital, you will need two great runes to access.
[32:03.67]So, you know, Morgott's great rune.
[32:05.69]Oh, and we've had our first square mark, by the way.
[32:07.93]Sombra plus nine.
[32:09.34]So Chris is in a really great position here.
[32:11.38]Sombra plus nine is such a strong, powerful thing to have in a game like this.
[32:16.76]Like I said before, there are so many bosses on this board, and when you have damage, the bosses are so fast, you don't even have to be good at the boss, you can just melt them.
[32:24.88]So that is a really, really great square to have.
[32:26.74]And Aggie obviously sees that, and he knows.
[32:29.47]But I think Aggie will probably get the Smithing Stone, plus 16 eventually, and be in a similar position.
[32:33.87]I think Aggie's getting the Smithing Six here, behind, right in front of Verdank.
[32:38.45]So another thing that we haven't touched on is one thing the mod makes a little nicer is, if you'll remember in your casual playthrough,
[32:44.33]Upgrading Smithing Stone weapons is like, okay, I need one smithing one, then two, then three.
[32:48.29]Just to make it a little faster, we've done only one of them is required for each level.
[32:52.47]So plus three is three smithing stones.
[32:54.70]Plus six is three smithing twos after that and so on.
[32:57.82]So Aggie with only one smithing 16 is going to have enough materials here to get plus 16 on it looks like.
[33:04.34]the Mantis Blade.
[33:05.88]Interesting.
[33:06.68]There it is.
[33:07.08]Look at those levels.
[33:08.20]That's nice.
[33:08.86]Yeah.
[33:09.14]Okay.
[33:09.32]And they both have maxed out weapons.
[33:10.76]That's actually really, really great that they both went for those.
[33:13.08]I think that's hilarious.
[33:13.80]Yeah.
[33:13.90]We're going to have two very different builds.
[33:15.88]This will be fun to watch.
[33:17.68]This actually also highlights the importance of the center square now with the diagonal of Aggie and starting on column three for Chris.
[33:25.89]Yeah.
[33:26.21]And I have to imagine the players are seeing that square because again, center square positioning is so crucial.
[33:31.81]And that goal with a plus 16 or a somber plus 9 is going to be so easy.
[33:35.99]Yep, yep, yep.
[33:37.51]Typically free space, right?
[33:38.62]Completely, yeah.
[33:40.94]I mean, the Sleeping Golem can do some shenanigans.
[33:43.00]It's not the most well-programmed area in the game.
[33:45.96]But generally speaking, at this scaling, it should be free.
[33:49.48]So where would you have started, either one of you?
[33:51.88]I think if... We played a lot of duos this year, and in duos it's very different, but in solos like this, you have to set up.
[33:58.98]Yeah, I would have started how they started with the weapon.
[34:01.10]You just need a weapon.
[34:02.40]There's just no other way.
[34:03.64]So the good thing about having these on the board is you want to set up a weapon anyway, but then you're like, oh, my God.
[34:08.26]Well, sometimes you don't set up a weapon and you just rely on, I can just hitless every boss, but that's obviously risky.
[34:13.05]Yeah, I got good.
[34:14.35]Yeah, exactly.
[34:15.21]I know what to do.
[34:16.97]So sometimes you have that mental, like, oh, is the other guy going to go no-hit all these bosses?
[34:21.53]Should I not be leveling up my weapon?
[34:23.11]So when they are on the board, you don't really have to worry about that because you're going to level up your weapon and you're also going to get a square.
[34:29.01]So in this case, I think the no-brainer one would have been to grab a weapon.
[34:32.90]Yeah, and it looks like...
[34:35.20]Chris is heading down into, further into Limgrave.
[34:39.50]Tibia Mariners.
[34:40.56]Oh, Tibia Mariners.
[34:41.54]We have Tibia Mariner on bottom left and that's kind of south Limgrave and Chris looks like he might be on his way to there.
[34:47.83]Hardest boss in the game.
[34:48.91]Completely.
[34:50.23]And it looks like Aggie's finishing up this tunnel here with the Falling Star Beast.
[34:54.05]Is there a Falling Star Beast on the card?
[34:56.69]Um, I actually don't think so.
[34:58.79]But he does, this mount might drop the Somberstone Bellbearing.
[35:01.13]Oh, the Somberstone Bellbearing, yeah.
[35:02.67]In the top row, we have Acquire Somberstone Bellbearing.
[35:04.78]Oh, yeah, this is one.
[35:05.90]Yeah, this is one.
[35:06.90]And so you'll see also that Aggie applied Rot Grease, I think.
[35:10.82]I'd have to imagine he did.
[35:12.02]I can't see exactly.
[35:12.66]I don't think that he did, but, you know.
[35:15.32]If he had it, he probably would have done.
[35:16.96]I'll skill him.
[35:19.24]This boss is like a mid-tier scale, so with his weapon, it should be relatively fine.
[35:25.74]Yeah.
[35:26.08]The only problem is that Falling Star Beast resists slash.
[35:28.70]Oh, yeah.
[35:29.64]The audio is like right, left, wrong.
[35:33.80]Oh, no.
[35:36.18]So, Jerma, as a more casual fan, you haven't seen a lot of stuff like this, right?
[35:41.30]How does something like this compare to the runs that you do?
[35:45.54]Well, I don't do any runs.
[35:48.40]Well, yeah, my casual run was, I did it on stream, but a lot more, I would say a lot more screaming.
[35:54.39]There was a lot more yelling.
[35:55.93]Well, we haven't seen, there could be screaming.
[35:57.58]That's very true, yeah.
[35:58.92]I think you just got a bad hitbox there.
[36:01.62]Classic, classic Fallen Star Beast.
[36:04.27]Yeah, it was a lot of stress, a lot of pain.
[36:07.15]Yes.
[36:08.13]Very classic FromSoftware.
[36:09.49]But there is joy also.
[36:11.09]Yes, it's definitely balance.
[36:13.01]What was your snake buddy's name?
[36:15.64]Who is that guy?
[36:16.44]Mambo.
[36:16.96]Mambo.
[36:17.44]Thank you.
[36:18.32]I was trying to tell Ludwig about it.
[36:19.62]I was like, yeah, you and your snake man.
[36:21.02]Yeah, the snake friend.
[36:22.42]Yeah.
[36:23.12]He did a lot of work.
[36:24.42]I used to watch, speaking of, we have Kill Moog in the sewers.
[36:28.11]That's right.
[36:28.59]The elegance Moog was the greatest thing I've ever seen in Elden Ring yet to this day.
[36:33.76]It's hilarious.
[36:35.03]I mean, there's a lot of lead-up to kill the Vogue.
[36:37.95]Yeah, the build-up was crazy.
[36:38.99]They hyped it up.
[36:40.47]For those who don't know, my chat kept telling me that each boss was Moog.
[36:46.04]Oh, hey, you're going to get to Vogue.
[36:48.28]That's a Vogue-like enemy.
[36:49.28]So I ended up fighting like eight different Moogs.
[36:52.30]Okay.
[36:54.21]I actually feel like I may have made it up, and then they made it up back to me.
[36:58.02]So we do that in our community.
[37:00.88]Just a little reverse gaslighting.
[37:02.20]Just a little reverse, you know, reverse, reverse gaslighting.
[37:04.53]But you got the real Moog in the end, right?
[37:06.39]Oh, yeah.
[37:06.61]Okay, good, good.
[37:08.79]I played through this game so many times, even off-stream.
[37:13.11]Isn't it just a remarkable game?
[37:17.21]Ludwig was like, hey, man, do you want to be on the couch?
[37:19.00]I was like, yeah.
[37:19.82]Fucking Elden Ring.
[37:22.08]Get out of the way.
[37:23.84]I love this game.
[37:24.58]I think it's a culmination of every single genre.
[37:26.96]It's so good.
[37:28.56]And I'm so fucking pumped for the DLC.
[37:31.10]I can't even...
[37:32.85]I'm scared of the DLC.
[37:34.07]Me too, though, low-key.
[37:35.21]Uh-huh, because I have this feeling that FromSoftware, because all the FromSoftware DLC has always been way hard.
[37:41.89]Way hard.
[37:42.31]For nothing.
[37:43.15]So what is this one going to be like?
[37:45.62]How incredibly hard?
[37:47.84]Aggie described it the other day as, I can't wait to see what Elden Ring is like with the gloves off.
[37:52.50]Right, yeah.
[37:54.14]Speaking of gloves off, I'm going to kick the shit out of everything.
[37:59.77]I'm going to get to Messmer, and I'm going to attempt him once, and then I'm just going to go, okay, I'll let the professionals handle it.
[38:06.03]That's fine.
[38:07.05]I'll let the pros handle it from here on out.
[38:09.85]So Aggie did get the Memory of Grace with 50k plus runes.
[38:14.25]Nice to have it out of the way.
[38:15.03]He might be looking at that Row 1.
[38:16.95]Actually, I don't know about the Estelles, but it is a possible one to have.
[38:20.75]It's also good to just threaten a row.
[38:23.70]You put pressure on your opponent if you're like,
[38:26.26]Look at this.
[38:27.02]Look what I got.
[38:27.88]More marbles.
[38:29.64]And then they crave marbles and, you know, act accordingly.
[38:33.00]Yeah, it does suck when that happens.
[38:34.52]And so they'll threaten the line and there's like one square left that you're like, I know that they're not going to go for that.
[38:40.59]So maybe I shouldn't worry about it, but maybe they will go for it.
[38:43.55]I don't know.
[38:44.03]And then you have to go for it and block off that line.
[38:47.45]Just the threat of defense makes you have to adjust accordingly.
[38:50.09]Yeah, it's brutal.
[38:50.89]It's brutal.
[38:51.94]Now, the two Blackknife Assassins, there's one in a dungeon pretty early, right?
[38:57.09]Yeah, so there's a couple of Blackknife bosses, but this goal also counts the standing Blackknife enemies.
[39:02.45]And if you remember in Consecrated Snowfield, there's that Everjail that leads to the Halic Tree.
[39:08.79]And there are some Blackknife enemies there that our players might choose to kill.
[39:11.67]It looks like Chris is going for the Sleeping Golem here, just claiming that center square, and he's going to be pretty uncontested here.
[39:18.30]Meanwhile, Aggie going into Radon.
[39:20.51]Yeah, I think looking at Radon into maybe Mimic Tear eventually.
[39:25.60]He's not summoning, so maybe going for Hit List potentially?
[39:28.16]I did Radon pre-patch, by the way.
[39:31.18]Oh, yeah.
[39:33.82]You're better than me.
[39:34.70]Hey, air high-five.
[39:36.34]There it is.
[39:37.64]Pre-patch Radon.
[39:38.84]It was not easy, but we got him down.
[39:42.12]I will say, I think what happened was they patched it, made him easier, and then actually put him back to normal.
[39:48.01]So you're only a chump if you fought him in the middle.
[39:51.45]I'm straight.
[39:54.59]So I think Aggie is going for hitless here.
[39:57.25]If he's able to beat Radon hitless, that means a square.
[40:00.51]He's got the Rot Grease, so he's got Rot Proc on Radon here, which is really great, which means he's got a passive damage buildup.
[40:06.51]to sort of help him out here, because his scaling is okay, but not great.
[40:10.25]But we're going to have to see how Aggie executes this fight here.
[40:13.71]Yeah, it does suck when you see these gamers who, like, hit list the entire boss and then get one tiny little poke at the end to just some bullshit hitbox.
[40:22.76]And then they're like, well, I'm just going to finish off the fight.
[40:24.68]I'm not going to reset it at this point.
[40:27.10]Like that.
[40:27.86]You know what?
[40:28.30]That's called caster curse.
[40:29.60]This is why we shouldn't mention these things.
[40:31.93]Yeah, this is why we don't talk about the fights.
[40:33.79]The one that always gets me is the...
[40:36.31]the rocks into the orbs.
[40:38.01]Oh, yeah.
[40:39.17]If he throws it at, like, in an opportune time when I'm just trying to set up to be in the correct place for the next hit that I'm setting up, it always catches me.
[40:46.75]And he always knows to do the rocks and then the orbs.
[40:48.97]He's like, oh, this is the moment.
[40:50.21]Yeah, and then he jumps after that, and you're like, just throw every fucking thing, why don't you?
[40:54.85]I never even fought him off the horse.
[40:56.54]Dude, we're actually just going to have to do it.
[40:57.92]I've only fought him on the horse.
[40:59.14]On Torrent.
[40:59.78]It's nice that they let you ride the horse during that fight.
[41:02.10]I will say, very generous.
[41:02.98]And the arena's quite big, actually.
[41:04.50]Funsoft is known for bad arenas.
[41:06.50]It was a lot of hit and then run across the entire game to get away.
[41:10.88]Nothing wrong with that.
[41:12.01]Until I'm ready.
[41:13.41]Radon's a beast.
[41:15.09]In lore, in the game.
[41:17.18]You know who else is a beast?
[41:18.18]Margit, who I know is the number one noob killer of all of FromSoft probably.
[41:22.63]But at Sombra plus 9.
[41:23.91]I mean, Chris is also not a noob.
[41:26.83]It's like, you know, he'll be fine.
[41:29.33]So Chris is definitely heading into Godrick here.
[41:31.67]I think he's also looking at maybe Tree Spirits eventually.
[41:33.93]There is a Tree Spirit in this castle.
[41:36.11]Yeah.
[41:37.35]So it would be really great for Aggie if he gets this hit list.
[41:42.45]Yeah.
[41:43.45]So basically our players are racing for this goal right now.
[41:47.52]And summoning the boys here, as we like to call them in Radon's fight, this is fine for Hitless so long as Agi doesn't get hit.
[41:54.25]Yeah, it is kind of hard with summons.
[41:55.57]As much as summons make things easier, if you know the fight and you know how to, like, dance with him, it makes it harder to have summons because, you know, Radon will change who he's locked onto, and then it messes you up.
[42:07.11]But, you know, it looks like Agi's doing just fine.
[42:09.01]We're going to get Phase 2 here.
[42:10.20]It's also nice to have Okina for the equipment.
[42:14.66]the chance, I would believe.
[42:16.00]Yeah, totally.
[42:18.88]So fun fact, Radon flies in from where your camera is facing in Phase 2.
[42:23.59]So Aggie's going to face it away from the Grace so that when Radon dies, he will be ideally closer to the Grace, saving those precious, precious seconds.
[42:34.15]We had a hundred bucks come in from I am not a terror is, and it said, watch dozens of hours of Aggies, no hit randomizer attempts.
[42:41.62]And Chris is 10 times enemies challenge run.
[42:43.90]One of the most impressive things I've seen.
[42:46.30]Very excited to see them at an event like this.
[42:48.28]Those are probably two of the most impressive challenges I've ever seen.
[42:52.37]Yeah.
[42:54.19]I think, yeah, I mean, definitely some of the best elderly players in the world.
[42:57.77]Okay.
[42:59.41]It's just Aggie here.
[43:00.37]The boys are gone.
[43:01.71]Yeah, I'm scared to even talk about this.
[43:03.17]No more boys.
[43:03.69]It's going to be a little safe.
[43:09.05]I was going to say, he could do a really nice move, or he's about to be an asshole.
[43:12.46]Yeah, yeah.
[43:12.68]He's about to be an asshole.
[43:13.32]So Aggie's going to do a dismount here, maybe.
[43:15.04]No, just running away.
[43:16.48]Dismount here, potentially.
[43:17.88]Jump over.
[43:19.48]Going to play it safe.
[43:20.28]Going to play it safe, hopefully.
[43:21.60]That's good.
[43:25.80]That's good.
[43:26.30]Let's go.
[43:26.56]Let's go.
[43:27.20]That's so scary.
[43:28.16]Even he knew it.
[43:28.90]He was like, yeah, I do that.
[43:31.42]Yeah, dude.
[43:32.38]That's a really big square for him.
[43:34.00]If I had a heart rate monitor, I mean, I'm not even playing.
[43:36.58]Yeah, I'm just saying.
[43:38.84]Like 200.
[43:39.36]So Chris is heading into the Godrick fight.
[43:40.66]He saw that he can't get that hit list square anymore, which, I mean, it sucks, but also you don't have to play it hit list, which is kind of nice.
[43:48.08]I mean, but if Aggie had died, I think he would definitely lose this square because Falling Star Beast Jaw is going to make quick work of Godrick here.
[43:53.51]Much easier, boss.
[43:55.81]That move there when he did the Ashen Core, a lot of times it causes Godrick to do that spinning motion.
[44:02.86]Yeah.
[44:03.16]And if you're close enough to him, he'll actually just go straight into...
[44:06.78]the animation where he rolls and then jumps, you can actually just walk forward and he'll just go behind you and smack the hell out of him.
[44:12.69]Yeah, that's the one that you want to get.
[44:14.07]Sometimes he does the other one, depending on how far you are.
[44:16.41]Yeah, the projectiles are so ass.
[44:18.11]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:19.24]So Godrick has the best music in the game.
[44:21.84]You think so?
[44:22.38]That's a hot take.
[44:23.26]That's not even an opinion.
[44:25.74]I like Moog.
[44:26.46]I think Moog's music is my favorite.
[44:29.12]I think I'm a Fortisax fan.
[44:30.56]Yeah, there you go.
[44:31.64]Now we're talking.
[44:33.67]And also, that was hit list for Chris, which means clutching that square was huge for Aggie.
[44:37.65]Yeah.
[44:39.53]So what are we looking at here?
[44:40.67]I think Aggie's still pushing Somberson, bell bearings.
[44:45.95]And then Chris is going to get Colossal Armor.
[44:48.12]It's only here.
[44:48.60]He just has to wait for... Or is Falling Star Beast Shot Colossal?
[44:53.14]I think it is.
[44:55.32]I don't know why.
[44:56.46]Maybe it's not, I guess.
[44:57.38]But didn't you pick that up at a Colossal check?
[44:59.63]I thought so.
[45:00.55]I could be way off base, but I'm curious why he hasn't marked it.
[45:04.88]Yeah.
[45:05.68]Maybe he's just thinking about it.
[45:09.14]Well, so in the League, actually, there's penalties for not marking because obviously you can hold things and mess around.
[45:14.42]Oh, God, are we the refs?
[45:16.72]Oh, that's no good.
[45:18.80]We're not good at that.
[45:19.88]Well, yeah, there's no rules here.
[45:21.38]There's no rules.
[45:22.78]I guess in this case, if Chris doesn't mark that, let's say that is a colossal weapon, if he doesn't mark the square, he's just going to lose the square, so it's fine, I guess.
[45:30.28]I'll Google it.
[45:31.04]Yeah, okay.
[45:32.24]I'll Google it.
[45:34.10]I mean, as much as me and Adaf and everyone knows about Elden Ring, there's always so much that you don't know.
[45:39.90]I'm sorry, I don't know the Falling Star Beast Jaw weapon class.
[45:43.56]There's infinite information.
[45:45.02]I love talking to every Elden Ring player, and you're like, how many side quests have you done?
[45:49.75]He's like, I haven't even touched half the shit you guys know about.
[45:52.89]It is colossal.
[45:54.29]So he's forfeit the square by not marking it.
[45:56.99]Really?
[45:57.55]Yeah, I don't know.
[45:59.45]Because you can't hold on to squares.
[46:01.31]Yeah, that kind of sucks for him.
[46:02.97]Do we mention it?
[46:03.85]I feel like it would be remiss to not be like, hey, dog.
[46:07.82]In the league, it's player's responsibility to mark, because it's part of the bingo.
[46:12.06]Because oftentimes, you'll be on the same square as someone, and it literally comes down to who marks faster.
[46:17.26]So that's why the players are responsible for their own squares.
[46:21.26]So I mean, I don't know.
[46:22.78]For the sake of the competition, maybe you should.
[46:24.48]I can tell.
[46:24.96]I mean, typically, the ref would go into voice call and tell them.
[46:27.58]And tell them he's forfeited it.
[46:28.72]Yeah, yeah.
[46:29.42]Where's Ludwig?
[46:30.10]We need to just, hey.
[46:31.10]Well, let me consult the Bingo Brawlers rule set and just be crystal clear on my decision making here.
[46:38.63]Maybe we should just leave it.
[46:39.39]And I think that Chris, if he sees that eventually, I don't think he'll mark it.
[46:42.13]I feel like we witnessed a car crash and we're like, what do we do now?
[46:47.97]It's very uncharacteristic, I will say, for Chris to miss a mark here.
[46:51.09]I mean, nerves, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[46:53.41]It looks like he's going after Godskin Noble.
[46:57.68]Yeah.
[46:58.48]So we do have this Godskin Noble square without status effects.
[47:01.10]So this is a great square for when you have a bleeding weapon or actually what the meta used to be is to have sleep pots and you throw the sleep pots at Godskin Noble.
[47:09.84]He falls asleep.
[47:11.40]You can get him dead before he even wakes up.
[47:14.82]So just to make the fight harder, they've added that square, so you have to fight him just with, you know, damage, physical damage, nothing else.
[47:21.91]If a player forgets to mark a square within 60 seconds, they'll be notified by the umpire that they can no longer mark that square and are locked out of it for the match.
[47:30.14]Okay.
[47:30.40]I mean, is this sweaty like that?
[47:32.04]I don't know.
[47:32.54]I don't know how sweaty you want to get.
[47:33.92]This is super casual.
[47:35.02]Alright.
[47:35.24]Well, then we'll leave it.
[47:36.00]Maybe he'll kill Estelle like this.
[47:39.72]I mean, that's sure, yeah.
[47:40.70]Maybe he'll do another boss with Colossal Weapon.
[47:43.37]Chat, donate $50,000 and you get to choose.
[47:46.95]We're pretty laissez-faire here.
[47:49.93]Yeah.
[47:50.55]This is all in good fun.
[47:51.33]It's all for charity.
[47:52.82]Yeah, I think we should just leave it.
[47:54.38]And I think, honestly, if Chris saw this square, he would know.
[47:57.56]Yeah.
[47:59.32]Alright.
[48:01.88]This is the duo.
[48:03.42]So this is the other Somberstone.
[48:04.55]Yeah, this drops the Somberstone Bellbearing 1.
[48:07.69]So Aggie's putting a lot of pressure on these corner squares.
[48:11.55]It's going to make bingos very difficult across the board and also kind of pressures Chris to either stay on the insides
[48:20.19]or commit to playing defense in the later parts of the game.
[48:23.55]Yeah, Chris is trying to block column 5 here.
[48:25.79]Yeah, he'll be blocking column 5 in a second.
[48:27.52]Also, we have Morgott's Great Rune, and usually, not always, but very often, when you see Morgott's Great Rune, you're going to assume that you don't really need to worry about it, unless you have reason to worry about it.
[48:39.42]clues that, you know, it's going to be in play.
[48:41.65]But for now, you see Morgott's graveyard and you're like, okay, I don't really have to worry about that for now.
[48:46.49]Another big thing is this also blocks what I assume Chris might be going for is the killing four bosses with God in it at the same time.
[48:53.42]Yeah.
[48:53.94]Yeah, so Rykard also counts because the second phase of Rykard is God devouring serpent.
[48:59.30]Oh, it counts the second phase.
[49:01.02]Oh, interesting.
[49:01.87]And you know who else?
[49:02.65]I don't know if they might... Maybe they would do it just because we're, you know, here.
[49:06.65]But Melenia also has the word Goss in it.
[49:10.01]She is goddess of Wrath.
[49:11.79]So doing Melenia and Rykud as a god boss is usually a very power play.
[49:16.26]I mean, at this point, Chris might have to do it to get that colossal armache.
[49:20.32]There are a lot of...
[49:21.88]yeah I guess you're right he could Malenia with colossal weapons actually quite nice in my opinion so there's the block from Chris so column five is no longer viable for aggie to get a bingo but it looks like aggie was already doing row one instead anyway
[49:35.08]It's so crazy that you guys talk about colossal weapons and all these different things and these deep, deep levels.
[49:40.58]There's like 30% of people who have not even seen Margit's health bar.
[49:44.00]If you look at the PS Trophy, the PS5 Trophies, the PS4 Trophies, there's such a huge, huge dynamic of like, oh, actually, I haven't even been to the first race yet.
[49:52.63]And there's all this knowledge that people have on the other end of the spectrum.
[49:56.81]It's a wild, wild game.
[49:58.95]Yeah, it's very cool.
[50:00.11]And I mean, I guess we hope that with stuff like this, people can see it.
[50:03.40]And instead of being overwhelmed, they would instead think, wow, this looks very cool.
[50:07.42]I think something that I want to get across that I've heard a lot of feedback from a lot of speedrunning events where people watching are like, man,
[50:14.15]this feels impossible, these players are so good, and we all started somewhere.
[50:19.40]We were all dogshit at Elden Ring when the game came out.
[50:23.62]So if you're seeing what you're watching today and you're like, man, I wish I were that good, you absolutely can be.
[50:30.13]Just play the game, and if you're having fun, keep having fun.
[50:33.39]Yeah, I mean, definitely just play the game.
[50:35.13]These guys have thousands and thousands of hours.
[50:37.57]Adaph and I have thousands of, I mean, you know, hundreds at least.
[50:41.07]I don't know that I'm going to put myself in the thousands tier.
[50:44.01]Yeah, but you know, like, and plus, if you're a Souls player, like, being good at other Souls games gives you so much experience.
[50:51.88]Yeah, it's transferable.
[50:52.62]And you can read boss moves a lot easier and stuff.
[50:55.18]So it just comes with experience.
[50:56.58]I mean, some people are talented, of course, but, you know, hard work also matters a little bit.
[51:01.36]yeah this these souls games soulslike games FromSoftware games these are my favorite games ever made oh yeah and I'm I'm dog at a lot of these well you know relatively speaking okay I just like to point out Soldier of Godrick here I don't know if you guys saw it Chris breathed on him and he died yeah but that did that's actually one of the hardest bosses in the game that is like one of the strongest characters I mean his name literally contains the word god yeah soldier of god
[51:27.69]But they're just fun.
[51:28.81]They're just fun to play.
[51:29.59]Oh, they're a delight.
[51:30.95]And the feeling of relief, it's like euphoric when you beat a hard boss.
[51:33.97]Oh, yeah.
[51:35.13]Like, after beating Millenia, I fought her for 24 hours, and it was just like, I couldn't breathe.
[51:41.50]Was that also a free patch?
[51:43.50]Yeah, it was all early.
[51:44.84]And I like to just like classic Souls gamer.
[51:48.96]I was like, you know what?
[51:49.84]I'm going to beat her.
[51:50.52]I was on level 84, and people are like, you can't beat her unless you're level 140.
[51:54.98]And I'm like, well, you know what?
[51:56.58]I'm just going to beat her right now.
[51:57.96]I'm not leaving here, though.
[51:58.84]Yeah, exactly.
[51:59.64]When you're on stream, it's personal.
[52:01.52]When somebody's like, you're not capable of this, I'm like, well, actually, I fucking am.
[52:04.91]And then someone's like, oh, I was fighting her with daggers, and people are like, you know, you should probably use this, probably use this.
[52:10.69]And I'm like, you know what?
[52:11.55]I'm not using any of that now.
[52:13.21]Yeah, I can't lie.
[52:14.43]There definitely was a couple of mirror moments before I streamed Elden Ring and going to Malenia and just being like, looking in the mirror, like, you're going to do it?
[52:22.81]You can do this.
[52:23.55]I know you can do it.
[52:25.21]You beat Sekiro on stream.
[52:27.23]You can do this.
[52:27.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:29.79]And then I died to her for, like, five straight hours.
[52:32.25]Yeah.
[52:33.25]You know what, though?
[52:33.95]Like, I feel like Souls games, it might be cheesy, but I feel like it's taught me so much about, like, patience and perseverance and, like, whatever.
[52:42.64]I mean, more than just a game, for sure.
[52:46.80]So, Aggie is setting up Explosive Physic here.
[52:48.86]This Earth Tree Avatar drops that Explosive Physic tier.
[52:51.59]Meanwhile, Chris is heading into his third god boss.
[52:55.39]He killed Godskin Noble and Soldier of Godrick.
[52:58.05]And Godrick.
[52:59.19]Oh, he did Godrick.
[52:59.83]So this is his fourth god boss.
[53:01.11]So this is him blocking off row one, actually, which is great.
[53:03.80]And Aggie, no, you know what?
[53:05.40]I was going to say Aggie doesn't know that Chris is doing this, but Aggie sees that Godskin Noble, so Aggie knows that Chris is about to get that square, I would say.
[53:13.04]I'm just waiting for the Lightning Ram Ash of War.
[53:16.30]I'm kind of so over this.
[53:17.36]I want them to start spinning.
[53:19.18]It's my favorite square, too.
[53:20.57]I need some spin dashes.
[53:22.11]It's actually so funny, that square.
[53:23.87]If you don't know, there's this Ash of War that turns you into the Lightning Ram and you, like,
[53:28.50]lightning and roll into them, and so it's to kill 10 sheep.
[53:31.42]And you see these gamers, they're like no-hitting Malenia, doing like low-level radons, da-da-da-da-da.
[53:37.18]And then you see them do that lightning ash.
[53:39.04]And they're like, get over here!
[53:39.92]Yeah, yeah.
[53:40.34]Stop running away!
[53:40.88]And you see them roll into the sheep, and the sheep are rolling away.
[53:43.52]They hate you.
[53:43.90]Yeah, yeah.
[53:45.10]I've had hitless runs just ruined because I was, you know, talking to Bok or something, and they decided, hey, fuck this, I'm going to roll into you.
[53:52.01]There's also the classic, like, was that nine sheep or eight?
[53:54.37]Yeah.
[53:56.46]And then you're like, okay, I'll just kill an extra one.
[53:57.76]Yeah, I'll just kill one more.
[53:58.84]It's fine.
[54:01.20]So, yeah, here's Chris fighting Rykard with the Serpent-Hunter weapon, which, you know, it's a great one against this boss.
[54:09.14]This is my favorite version of the Dark Souls gimmick boss.
[54:12.38]Me too.
[54:12.80]I think Rykard has done so well.
[54:14.81]Yeah, it's such an extravagant fight.
[54:16.39]It's so beautiful.
[54:17.00]That's a great way to describe it.
[54:18.70]Compared to, like, Yhorm, because people like to parallel this to Yhorm a lot in Dark Souls 3, and Yhorm is just, like, a big guy who kind of... And also, like, when you die to Rykard, it's hilarious.
[54:27.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:30.01]You don't see the skulls as an inconvenience?
[54:34.04]Well, you know what?
[54:34.80]You should look at how they handle it, because the way the strat is with this weapon is that... The weapon art?
[54:40.96]Like, if you see the move that he's about to do that summons the skulls, you'll cancel it every single time.
[54:46.33]Okay, everybody pay attention.
[54:48.11]Yeah, so ideally, you never want to see the skulls.
[54:50.43]I mean, obviously, if you're playing casually, you don't know that.
[54:52.45]The skulls do suck.
[54:53.65]Couldn't you get him stuck in an animation?
[54:55.68]Yeah, that's what they're doing.
[54:57.54]So you'll see he does this thing where he raises his leg and slams it down.
[55:01.14]That's like his phase 2.5.
[55:02.66]That's the scary move and you want to charge attack or L2 or whatever it is.
[55:07.49]It'll probably be after this move.
[55:09.09]This will be enough damage that he'll start going for the phase transition maybe after this sword swing.
[55:12.99]And so then Chris will just use weapon arts basically from there for a while because the weapon art full staggers him out of that animation every time.
[55:20.03]Yeah, and then you can do, like, the baby staggers or whatever, and then you can probably get them down.
[55:26.35]Yeah, so here it is.
[55:27.07]Yeah, there's the LEGO.
[55:28.21]So he's going to charge his L2, cancel it, then maybe go for the L2 follow-up.
[55:33.29]Doesn't look like it.
[55:33.83]Since it's a full stagger, Chris is just going to go for these jump R2s.
[55:36.15]Too bad this weapon didn't do this for the rest of the game.
[55:40.48]I know.
[55:41.02]No.
[55:41.28]Just have a laser.
[55:44.38]Cross the whole map.
[55:46.60]And we got an Aggie here on the Tibia Mariners as well.
[55:49.57]But, yeah, there's the four god bosses square.
[55:51.92]Nicely done, Chris.
[55:53.30]So far, we're neck and neck.
[55:54.50]Yeah.
[55:54.90]Four to four.
[55:55.60]It's a great game.
[55:59.08]What would you guys like to see, Jerma?
[56:00.43]What are you interested in on the board here?
[56:01.85]Oh, there's the physic as well.
[56:02.93]That's the explosive physic there.
[56:03.95]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[56:04.61]Aggie moves himself up.
[56:05.77]Cool.
[56:06.25]Just got it.
[56:07.56]Honestly, the learn 12 sorceries to me is that you just get a bunch of runes and just go buy a bunch.
[56:12.28]Yeah, exactly.
[56:13.58]So that's another money dump square.
[56:16.42]All the money dump squares, you're like, I don't really want to do this unless you... There sometimes is kill a boss with sorceries only or stuff like that.
[56:23.60]But in this case, it's just kind of a useless square.
[56:26.24]So you might avoid those and...
[56:28.26]There's a little bit of synergy with 12 Sorcs because, like, there are a few of them throughout the world just lying about.
[56:34.19]And so if you have a square that goes past one of those, you can pick one up for free.
[56:37.88]Or, like, there are bosses that drop them.
[56:40.92]Yeah.
[56:42.04]Yeah.
[56:42.83]No, do we want to?
[56:44.07]Bruh!
[56:45.51]I don't think it's fine.
[56:47.97]I don't know.
[56:48.95]Chris, can you hear me?
[56:51.25]Nope.
[56:53.01]See, it's kind of a tough call to make.
[56:55.14]Oh, they figured it out.
[56:57.30]They figured it out, but it sucks because Aggie's entire game plan will change based on if Chris has that square or not, which is why it's so important.
[57:05.48]People might be watching and being like, oh, no, they're so stingy about this, but it really does change the opponent's game plan.
[57:10.12]See, Aggie thought Chris was working on something else, and then Aggie's like, wait, how did he do Colossal
[57:14.98]He was just lying to me, which, yeah, he was a little bit.
[57:18.02]He did tell him he forgot to mark it.
[57:19.62]He doesn't know how crazy he just went with Falling Star, Beast Jaw.
[57:25.07]Oh, wait, they're talking about it right now.
[57:29.54]Chris said it was 30 seconds after you did Hit List.
[57:31.32]So, yeah, they know it was like 15, 20 minutes ago.
[57:36.24]know it's up to them yeah I don't want to intrude on their thing yeah we'll let them go this is not a a tournament match it's all for charity we're looking right now live at aggie's seething rage yeah exactly he's just not yeah yeah exactly this is classic it's like he always that's like so notorious everyone always like aggie you don't know how he's feeling like he's just like always looks kind of like
[57:59.67]this stone phase killer yeah yeah yeah so the kill uh remembrance boss bow only yeah is it I'm trying to think is there is there a boss where you can kind of stand back and just like like a dragon you usually want to do bow only so so here's another thing with uh Elden Ring bingo is
[58:16.75]You look at all those squares, and sometimes when you have kill a boss colossal only, kill a boss sorcery only, kill a boss remembrance boss only, you have to consider who's the easiest for which.
[58:26.41]And so Chris has already killed Godrick, and usually for Bo only, you want to do Godrick usually every single time.
[58:32.86]I don't really see why you wouldn't want to do him.
[58:34.90]And Chris has basically forfeited that square now because unless you have like a really, really strong bow, that's a hard square to pull off to someone else.
[58:43.14]So yeah, typically Godrick, you can do it for others, but it's a lot harder.
[58:49.08]So I would say Chris has probably forfeited that square now.
[58:51.80]Yeah, it's really only ever going to be Godrick for Remembrance Boss Bow only.
[58:55.55]Yeah.
[58:56.52]Yeah, I mean, I'm sure sometimes you can level up a really strong bow, but I don't really see that.
[59:00.14]Yeah, it's so much investment, like, to get the smithing stones and the runes, whereas, like, Godrick, you can, you know, if you have enough arrows, all of the players, you know, that are doing bingo should be able to do Godrick.
[59:11.31]Yeah.
[59:11.71]Pretty hitless there.
[59:12.51]And there is a difference between bow and great bow.
[59:14.93]Like, it would signify that.
[59:16.19]No, those are fine.
[59:16.89]Yeah.
[59:17.03]Okay.
[59:18.13]But usually the issue is, like, just running out of arrows.
[59:21.00]Yeah.
[59:21.94]And not having enough damage if you don't level up your bow.
[59:24.24]So, like, there's, like, a jump shot you can do that's really good.
[59:26.54]But, I mean, Godrick especially, he's got that spinning, like, tornado move.
[59:30.12]And then the arrows will jump off of that.
[59:32.76]And so stuff like that kind of sucks.
[59:34.34]Is there a way to block and there's no win?
[59:38.30]There's no bingo?
[59:39.10]Well, it's majority after that.
[59:40.46]So it's a majority.
[59:41.12]Yeah, yeah.
[59:41.86]So the bingo line is worth...
[59:43.47]We're playing a rule set today where bingo line is two extra points rather than a win.
[59:47.39]I see.
[59:47.67]Okay.
[59:48.15]So whoever gets 13 points first wins.
[59:50.83]So currently, Aggie is sitting on five points, and Chris is also sitting on five points.
[59:55.95]I see.
[59:56.85]Cool.
[59:57.51]So this is where I would get real freaky with the plan and just rush row four and not think,
[60:02.26]Yeah.
[60:03.46]No one would ever consider the fact that you're going for something so long.
[60:06.34]Yeah.
[60:06.62]So sometimes the strat can really be like, just be crazy enough and do something that is a stupid idea, but it will work because it's so dumb and the other person won't, you know, guess.
[60:16.71]They're playing such a long game and you're just going one idea.
[60:19.85]There are some people who play like that, who are just kind of like throw darts on a board and see what lands.
[60:24.81]And then you can't predict what they're doing.
[60:26.40]And you're like, oh my God, this sucks.
[60:28.44]How can you predict my moves if I can't?
[60:30.40]Yeah, you can pick random cubes.
[60:32.58]Yeah, there you go.
[60:34.15]I'm going to go kill Mohg, and then I'm going to go get the Tibia Mariners.
[60:39.37]It's like, what are you doing?
[60:40.47]Where are you going?
[60:41.32]Write a Python script to choose your goals for you, just at complete random.
[60:44.78]so here we have Chris who's looking at that Thops academy key which is you know the guy Thops he's like over there and he's uh he's like oh no my key I can't I don't know that's exactly what he's like yeah that's exactly what he's literally that was perfect and Chris is gonna go grab this key and I think he's gonna return it to Thops and Thops also sells sorceries so Chris will probably be eyeing that square as well
[61:05.74]The only thing about Topps is that he, and this is annoyingly, like, actually, he has three sorceries, but Sellen also carries two of the same.
[61:15.15]And so you got to be kind of careful with which ones you buy from Topps because you might waste some money.
[61:20.01]Because Sellen, who you have to go to for 12 sorceries, I mean, she ends up stocking like 10 by the time you get some scrolls.
[61:26.59]So being considerate of like, okay, which ones am I buying might matter.
[61:30.75]But also at this point,
[61:32.69]money is not going to be a huge issue for our players at this point they're beating a lot of bosses back to back so it really should not be a problem
[61:40.06]Yeah, he might grab the Grace and then go check sell and then come back and return Thopps' key.
[61:46.80]I hate Thopps.
[61:47.44]I usually call it Topps, but then Domo says Thopps and it confuses me.
[61:50.48]Apparently in-game his name is like Topps.
[61:52.98]Okay, great.
[61:54.76]Some NPC says it out loud at one point.
[61:57.20]Listen, after you give him the key, nothing matters anyway.
[62:00.12]He's gone.
[62:00.94]You often kill him for a staff.
[62:04.42]He gives you that sick move, the one where you just go like, whoop.
[62:07.68]He gives you the bubble move, doesn't he?
[62:09.89]In vanilla, maybe.
[62:11.13]Yeah, so unfortunately with the weapon randomizer, what spells you get from where are also random.
[62:17.25]So, yeah, Topps is like the bubble shield or whatever.
[62:21.52]By the way, I don't even know if that move works.
[62:23.70]I've tried to use it.
[62:24.72]I don't even think it works.
[62:25.72]You just said it was really good, though.
[62:27.16]Yeah, I was just making it up.
[62:28.62]Did you make sure you had the proper stats?
[62:31.16]It's like a parry, right?
[62:32.60]He does have a parry, yeah.
[62:34.42]I'm not familiar with sorceries.
[62:36.92]It's like a boom.
[62:38.50]it's like a big like sphere that goes like yeah oh can we get one more on those boobs let me try one more time I know what you're talking about the echo was I didn't sell it okay and you know what now we have and we we know what you're talking about and maybe he'll sell it maybe he'll we'll see this might be from a different game is this like Dark Souls 2 like
[62:59.80]Yeah.
[63:01.88]I don't actually know what they're on their way to do now.
[63:04.33]Chris is definitely returning the key.
[63:05.89]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[63:08.40]And we got Aggie and a dark...
[63:10.52]No, Aggie's doing the trio.
[63:11.74]Yeah, Aggie's doing rot-crystalline trio.
[63:14.18]Which this boss sucks.
[63:15.33]This is one of my least favorite boss fights in the game, especially low vigor.
[63:19.71]Because these bosses, I mean, once you get rot-procked, it's over.
[63:23.85]Yeah, so they rot you.
[63:25.25]And if you played this game on release, they were actually brutal.
[63:29.21]It was very like Dark Souls 2 gang fight.
[63:32.09]But actually, they just obliterated it.
[63:35.01]Now two of them just don't have a brain while one of them fights you.
[63:38.99]Yeah, they patched.
[63:40.22]The trio and duo fights were massively nerfed.
[63:42.90]They're in the background hitting TikTok dances while they're smacking their homies.
[63:48.28]Yeah, so we'll see that.
[63:52.96]Yeah, here's Chris with Dobs.
[63:54.20]I wonder if, isn't it the same spot every time, like the third sorcery is the one that is different?
[64:00.13]Probably.
[64:00.55]You're probably right about that.
[64:01.71]I think that's what it is, which is why I think that Chris isn't too scared of this.
[64:04.29]I'm looking at Jerma to see his excitement on.
[64:06.97]Do we have it?
[64:07.95]I don't know.
[64:08.96]Jerma, that's all you.
[64:10.98]Okay, there was Comet Shard, or maybe Comet, and then I didn't know the other two.
[64:16.01]There was a circular thing, actually, if that was that.
[64:18.87]We're going to just say... Oh, Chris keeps giving us opportunities to look at it.
[64:23.34]He's too fast.
[64:27.19]Alright, and there's the key for him.
[64:28.89]So, yeah, the goal here for Aggie is do not get hit.
[64:31.07]Like, I know that's literally the goal of the game, but, like, against this particular boss especially.
[64:36.30]And after their stance breaks, the fight becomes much easier.
[64:39.32]Totally, yeah.
[64:41.64]Can you guys real quick talk about the difference between, like, stance and poise?
[64:44.82]I know a lot of people get confused.
[64:46.42]Like, poise is what makes them flinch initially versus stance being, like, what knocks them down.
[64:51.29]So poise is the one that knocks them down.
[64:53.03]So, like, every enemy has a hidden poise value.
[64:57.11]and a hidden poise timer so like if you imagine when the player is getting poisoned the bar starts to go up but then it slowly goes down when you get out of the swamp you can think of poise like that so if I do a charge r2 against this crystallian if it has a poise value of say 70 or something and I do 30 poise I have like five seconds to do another hit or the poise will go back up to 70.
[65:19.45]So it's like a mini health bar I'm reducing, trying to do it quickly to stagger them.
[65:23.58]The Crystallians are a bad example because they're like the only boss in the game where the poison meter never goes back up to make this boss a little better since they have crazy armor.
[65:31.68]But yeah, so there is an enemy will have a value, the stance like you're talking about, where like if you hit them, they flinch.
[65:38.71]But poise is about getting knocked over.
[65:40.83]And once you break their armor, they get staggered by almost everything.
[65:46.03]Yeah, that's like the posture meter in Sekiro, if you've played Sekiro.
[65:49.68]Similar.
[65:51.89]Yeah, these enemies also have some of the best, I guess, sound effects.
[65:54.83]Some of the sound effects.
[65:55.57]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[65:56.35]When you hit them, you mean?
[65:58.10]When they're trying to get you with, I think he's got, like, a spear.
[66:00.38]Yeah.
[66:00.80]This is just going to turn into, like, an onomatopoeia casting.
[66:07.04]Jerma's favorite sounds.
[66:08.70]Jerma's favorite sound effects.
[66:10.10]Welcome, everybody.
[66:10.76]Do you have a favorite sound effect in the game?
[66:12.10]Probably that one.
[66:12.54]Probably that one.
[66:13.88]I like when you hit them.
[66:14.76]It's so, oh, God, it's so satisfying.
[66:17.33]I like when you go into the capital for the first time and they blow the horn.
[66:20.39]It's like...
[66:23.42]That was beautiful.
[66:26.40]Thank you.
[66:28.38]Oh, my God.
[66:28.76]Look at that weapon.
[66:29.90]Chris is like, you don't even have to do anything.
[66:32.64]You just use that Ashivore.
[66:34.06]And that's one of the Black Knights.
[66:35.32]Yeah.
[66:35.60]So that's one down.
[66:36.70]Yeah.
[66:38.86]There are times in between, like,
[66:42.15]I don't know how to explain this, but a lot of these tiles or squares line up synergistically, and then once you kind of complete them, there's sort of like a reset where you're like, my next big thing.
[66:51.85]And a lot of, there's like a lot of strategy to even that where you can knock off a lot of easier ones or set yourself up to get a lot of them in a row.
[67:00.11]The Blackknife Assassin one is pretty interesting because, like, Lina and Misfit Gun's right there.
[67:05.19]Like, it's in Weeping Peninsula.
[67:06.37]It's not that hard to get to.
[67:07.67]But you can see themselves setting things up to do later things.
[67:10.69]It's always really interesting.
[67:11.45]You know what, it looks like Aggie is going to Ordena.
[67:14.49]I think he's going to do the two Blackknife Assassins here and snipe Chris on this.
[67:18.35]Yeah, so in Ordena, as Adath mentioned, there's a little cheese that you can manipulate the AI of the invisible Blackknife Assassins.
[67:24.82]If you've done this, you know how much that one sucks casually, but you can kind of bait them to jump off of the cliff.
[67:31.40]So Aggie might actually, if he successfully does it, please no caster curse, he might grab that one from Chris.
[67:38.82]But, I mean, it wasn't too big of an investment of time for Chris because of that weapon.
[67:42.12]No.
[67:42.58]Yeah.
[67:42.98]But, you know, a snipe is a snipe.
[67:44.81]And Chris picking up the Conspectus Scroll here, that's going to allow him to unlock more sorceries from Sellen.
[67:50.13]So Chris is definitely posturing the 12 sorceries here.
[67:53.34]Yeah.
[67:53.87]This is a close race.
[67:55.05]Yeah.
[67:56.13]What I like about this race, and I mean, all the races are interesting for different reasons, but I do kind of like races like this where they're like basically 100% doing opposite things.
[68:05.93]And so they're kind of like you see them doing their own thing and there's not too much like sniping going on.
[68:11.40]However, it is fun to watch a game where there are snipes, but it's very hard not to get frustrated as a player.
[68:17.10]There are games where you literally have the exact same plan and you just keep getting sniped and sniped and sniped.
[68:23.86]The snowballing is like... Yeah, the steamroll effect after that is because you have to...
[68:28.48]pivot.
[68:28.88]Not only that, but you have to work twice as hard faster.
[68:31.35]The worst thing is when they snipe you and then you're like, alright, they're never going to do this square next.
[68:35.19]And then they do that one too and you're like, god fucking damn it.
[68:37.59]Just watch on Eggie's screen here.
[68:39.01]You'll see the footsteps probably.
[68:40.79]And if we had sound, I'm not sure if we do a little bit, you'll hear them.
[68:44.32]I think they just, the first one might have just lunged.
[68:46.90]So he's luring the invisible assassins over the ledge and he's trying to bait them to do a like dash attack off the ledge, which will force them into the abyss, which counts as a kill.
[68:55.72]right it looks dumb as hell but um you can't see the assassin because you don't have the century you see there you see there okay so that's one that's one he needs another worst area in the whole game by the way yeah I'm not a fan of the archers after that dude the ordinal archers are like laser beams they no good brutal so he's got the second one here and it's nice you can see their footsteps in the snow so he knows generally where he is
[69:20.82]And Chris is actually in another Black Knife thing right now, so he will probably get sniped on this square.
[69:27.83]I mean, it looks like she's getting freaky a little bit.
[69:30.77]Is it a scenario where you just kind of turn to see that it's been filled, and you're like, oh, shit.
[69:34.91]Well, yeah, there's a lot of times where, like, you literally mark, you go to click the square, and then the other opponent clicks it, and you're just like, what the hell just happened?
[69:44.09]I have been sniped by less than a second before.
[69:46.92]Which is, like, there is no, but you also, like, you kind of have to respect it when it's that close.
[69:51.48]It's like, oh, you saw what I was doing.
[69:53.12]There's Aggie God, and you see Chris is like, oh.
[69:55.12]Yeah.
[69:55.86]It's like you click it, and it's the other color, and you're like, wait, something's wrong.
[69:59.66]Something's incorrect here?
[70:01.00]I was blue.
[70:02.74]For the last season, the program we were using to track the squares, you could put sound effects in.
[70:06.85]And Chris and I, to try to lighten up the mood when we got sniped, when the opponent selected a square, it would do the vine boom sound effect so that we would just not be so mad.
[70:15.97]Because you can't be mad when it's like,
[70:18.88]And then if they got a line, it would be the metal pipe drop.
[70:22.66]Oh, yeah.
[70:23.12]Just so that, you know, add a little brevity.
[70:24.79]We need an audio pack of like Jerma just doing sound effects.
[70:28.65]You need a pipe drop?
[70:29.45]Yeah.
[70:34.02]Did you peek in my mic?
[70:36.02]I didn't hear anything.
[70:38.64]That was a decibel, and it was a certain frequency that was so loud and so high-pitched, you didn't hear it at all.
[70:43.08]You have to be under the age of 12 to be able to hear.
[70:45.36]Eighteen dogs just walked in here mad as hell.
[70:47.29]You know when you scream and you yell really loud on Discord and it just kind of turns you off?
[70:50.35]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:51.79]Okay.
[70:53.91]Alright, Chris is in a hero's grave.
[70:57.37]What do we have here for hero's grave?
[71:01.02]um could be leonia bosses could be tree spirits he could be doing the uh the hero's grave right at the beginning in the stranded graveyard which leads to a tree spirit yeah um that looks to be the only things I see yeah well he's got a bunch of linear bosses because of he has Godrick he has Soldier of Godrick he has the Black Knife I think this is definitely the Limgrave hero's grave I think this is the uh oh right Limgrave not learning yeah that's right
[71:25.18]And he's heading into Raya Lucaria for maybe sorceries?
[71:30.25]Remembrances, potentially.
[71:32.29]So he's going for this little skip here.
[71:35.92]It's a good one.
[71:36.54]Skips that first room there in Raya Lucaria.
[71:38.80]Use cash with it.
[71:40.48]That is a really nice skip.
[71:41.62]He threw the kukri there because enemies in Elden Ring are alerted by sound, so if you throw a kukri against a wall, enemies will be like, oh, what was that?
[71:48.61]They're basically Jerma.
[71:51.15]What a fine kukri noise.
[71:52.45]This is a sound effect.
[71:54.59]Everybody shut the fuck up.
[71:55.72]I got to go check this out.
[71:56.56]I got to go over here and listen to that and mimic it.
[71:59.18]I'm telling you, I was a bird in a past life.
[72:01.44]Yeah.
[72:05.38]You're not lying about this beast jaw.
[72:07.42]It smoked it.
[72:08.92]For a while, right when the game came out and players were routing Hitless, this was a weapon that players really liked because the boss patterns hadn't been totally figured out yet.
[72:16.91]And if you can stand in the distance and just do the Asher Boar, it's pretty nice.
[72:20.83]Insert Moog Spear.
[72:22.37]Yeah, exactly.
[72:23.73]Ruining lives.
[72:25.23]So Chris is definitely going for his second Tree Spirit here.
[72:27.75]He just killed one, now heading to the one in Mount Gelmir.
[72:30.75]So it looks like Chris is going for that.
[72:32.31]Aggie, meanwhile...
[72:33.95]Maybe just heading towards remembrances, I guess.
[72:36.25]Well, so Egy's got Radon, and this would be his second.
[72:39.59]Capital access.
[72:41.02]Well, for what, though?
[72:42.30]Moog Sewers, capital access.
[72:44.38]Moog Sewers, Morgott's Great Rune.
[72:49.47]Yeah, that's really it.
[72:50.97]Is Morgott's Great Rune in that huge pain in the ass place?
[72:54.76]Yes.
[72:55.10]And that's why we were kind of thinking, okay, if we get Morgott's Great Rune, we should reshuffle.
[72:59.44]Then we were like, let's just not reshuffle, I guess.
[73:01.92]But usually when you see that on the board, it's like, ah, shit.
[73:04.78]Yeah, that's the Fel Twins fight on the bridge.
[73:08.94]What a weird fight.
[73:09.60]Awful joke.
[73:10.42]Just terrible timing for it.
[73:11.71]The first time I ever ran into the fellow twins was on 9-11.
[73:15.37]Oh.
[73:15.59]Not even joking.
[73:16.67]Yeah, that's brutal.
[73:17.91]Everyone laughed at me.
[73:18.71]They thought I was setting up a bit.
[73:20.12]Swear to God it was not a bit.
[73:21.12]What a weird coincidence.
[73:22.76]Just weird how life works out.
[73:23.86]Yeah.
[73:24.24]Now, I have a question about the last Tree Spirit.
[73:26.66]Will Chris reroute back to Stormvale, or where is the most likely?
[73:30.33]He'll do the Stormvale one.
[73:31.39]That's the lowest scaling, which is usually nice, because the lower the enemy scaling is, obviously, the quicker he can kill them.
[73:37.49]And he already has Stormvale Graces, which puts him right there.
[73:41.63]If he has Beside the Lift in Stormveil Castle, which he might not have, that puts him right there.
[73:46.05]But Secluded Cell, which is the Godrick Graces, also not far.
[73:49.24]Got it.
[73:49.56]Yeah, he probably didn't do it first just because he wanted to see if he was even contesting that square.
[73:53.12]Okay, interesting.
[73:54.50]Going to Altus, maybe for Lightning Ram, Ash of War, leaving the Tree Spirits open.
[74:02.14]He probably knows he has good purchase on this square right now.
[74:05.17]Yeah, so that's what you were talking about.
[74:06.45]Like, Chris knows that he's ahead on that square, probably.
[74:10.73]But you're always, you know, you never know for sure.
[74:14.53]But sometimes it's worth the risk to just hold it for a bit.
[74:19.73]Especially because he has the easy one open.
[74:22.08]This might be, I think for Aggie, the rationale here is not only is it capital access if he needs it, but these are also Red Wolf into Rennala is two Leornia bosses.
[74:31.51]Yes, true, true.
[74:33.79]I forgot the wolf was in the game.
[74:36.07]This guy?
[74:38.37]I just completely forgot that that enemy was in the game.
[74:41.57]There's like 150 bosses.
[74:43.37]I forget where some of them are.
[74:46.33]I like the red wolf.
[74:47.13]It's a little bit of a Sith knockoff.
[74:49.29]Red wolf is one of the bosses where once you get it down, it is so satisfying.
[74:53.37]That is a boss that is really nice to fight once you get it.
[74:56.41]I like it because it's...
[74:59.26]blow up or blow them up.
[75:00.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[75:02.10]It's a very Dragon Ball fight.
[75:04.84]You're either winning or Vegeta's winning.
[75:06.28]There's no, like... I hated this fight, too.
[75:08.84]The Rennala fight?
[75:10.12]You know what?
[75:10.52]The Rennala fight is weird, and a lot of people don't like it for a lot of reasons, but also it is beautiful, and Phase 2 is probably the most beautiful fight in the whole game, or among the most beautiful fights in the whole game.
[75:21.27]It is just so... It's such a beautiful, breathtaking everything, but yeah, the fight itself is pretty lame.
[75:27.47]Oh, Chris is doing the Tree Spirit in Altus.
[75:29.42]Okay, interesting.
[75:30.18]Yeah, that's an interesting choice.
[75:32.16]Maybe sign up for some later games, though?
[75:34.86]Yeah, maybe just the synergy of Altus feels nice to him here.
[75:37.76]It does take a little bit to get to the one in Stormvale.
[75:39.91]I actually didn't think about this one at all.
[75:42.21]I feel like, in my opinion, it's not worth it just because you probably have so much more health.
[75:46.42]But I don't know.
[75:47.48]What's the arena like for the one in Stormville?
[75:49.24]It's pretty bad.
[75:50.08]It's bad, yeah.
[75:50.90]Shit.
[75:51.36]Yeah, so, you know.
[75:53.78]Sometimes I feel like players just like to do weird things just for the vibes, too.
[75:58.72]Yeah, and also, you know, there's some implicit bias of like, oh, I hate that particular thing.
[76:02.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:04.17]Just like have a bad experience with it and just have bad omens.
[76:07.01]Yeah, everybody has that one or two things or areas that you're just like, I don't want to do that.
[76:11.57]Oh, yeah.
[76:11.99]And it might be completely different than anybody else.
[76:14.08]I beat Moog on my very first try, and I thought he was the easiest boss until I fought him again.
[76:18.08]And I was like, oh, this boss sucks.
[76:19.56]Isn't that wild how, like, FromSoft hard bosses, the first attempt will be the closest you'll get until your 100th attempt?
[76:25.22]Like, the game knows.
[76:26.96]I swear there's, like, a first try thing.
[76:30.08]Well, you go with the mentality of, I don't care.
[76:32.38]I'm just going to learn the fight.
[76:33.34]Who cares?
[76:33.92]There's no pressure.
[76:34.80]And then you get down to one hit, and you're like, oh!
[76:36.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:37.84]And then you never get there.
[76:39.64]Yeah.
[76:41.88]Unless you're Aggie who just stomps.
[76:44.26]Yeah, there's Rennala down.
[76:45.50]I'm so intrigued by Aggie's weapon choice here.
[76:47.62]The Mantis Blade, I mean, it is a solid weapon.
[76:49.26]It's very fast and, you know, DPS is definitely good.
[76:52.64]It's just not a weapon I feel like I see players choose.
[76:55.92]Very, very interesting.
[76:57.10]I have never seen that weapon.
[76:58.60]I didn't even know it existed until just now.
[77:00.88]There are so many goddamn weapons in this game.
[77:02.48]There's like 300 and something, yeah.
[77:04.12]I was about to do a weapon tier list and I was like, well, I got to block off like four streams for that.
[77:08.71]Shout out Rusty.
[77:11.33]I did it all FromSoftware boss tier list stream.
[77:14.01]Oh, yeah.
[77:14.59]And I did not realize how long that was going to take.
[77:16.89]Oh, yeah.
[77:18.07]It was like seven hours straight.
[77:19.77]And eventually I was just like, oh, shit.
[77:21.81]With Elden Ring included?
[77:22.77]You fool.
[77:23.95]You fool.
[77:24.47]Actually, it may have been pre-Elden Ring.
[77:26.06]I don't remember.
[77:26.62]But yeah, I remember it took forever.
[77:28.22]And you have more opinions on all of them than you thought you did.
[77:30.56]Like a boss you fought 10 years ago, you're like, wait, actually, I hated that boss.
[77:33.68]You pull up a YouTube clip of the fight and you're like, well, actually, this fight sucks.
[77:38.26]I was completely wrong of liking this.
[77:41.81]We do have Chris talking to Selin here, who is the sorcery lady.
[77:45.97]My queen.
[77:46.87]I think that... How much does she have?
[77:50.70]She's going to have, so she starts with eight, six or eight, and he has two scrolls, I believe.
[77:55.86]He has the one from near Topes.
[77:56.94]So yeah, he's going to have 10 here and he should have already picked up enough.
[77:59.88]It looks like he doesn't have enough money to buy all the ones he needs, so he will have to come back.
[78:03.88]Oh, he's looking for the duplicates on Topes there.
[78:06.02]This is pretty big because Aggie's killing balls right now and he drops another sorcery.
[78:11.62]He does drop a sorcery, but I think for Aggie, it's less about the sorcery and more about the Leia boss.
[78:16.24]But you're absolutely right.
[78:17.02]The sorcery does play in nicely.
[78:18.66]Yeah.
[78:20.08]yeah it's good to consider things like that if aggie was like aggie's probably like yeah this is useful for sorceries if that ends up coming about you're thinking like a bingo player you should play yeah I have I have like 3 000 hours you should play some bingo baby I'm just real I'm just real low-key about it
[78:38.05]uh... is that you do you think that the uh... back to learn how probably probably Deathbird I would say that's a very quick one that's right here yet changing it tonight is that bird is right here and then I don't know how many linear bosses he's on right now probably four he may go for a night's calf uh... since it's already nighttime yeah he's not for true true
[78:55.65]Unless, no, no, he did Tibia Mariner, so he has at least five.
[78:58.16]Yeah, Tibia Mariner, Ranala, Red Wolf, Bulse.
[79:01.40]Did he do anything else?
[79:02.07]Tree Sentinel for the, not Tree, the Tree Lady.
[79:04.63]Oh, the Erdtree Avatar for the, yes, that's five.
[79:06.61]So this will be his final Laurnia boss here.
[79:09.26]Yeah, this game is really close.
[79:11.02]Is there a world where he uses Redfeather Branch Sword for any bosses?
[79:16.12]Maybe.
[79:17.38]It's kind of hard to set up if you don't have a way to damage yourself.
[79:20.53]Oh, that's right.
[79:22.45]Nice dodge there.
[79:24.63]Okay, so that's 12 sorceries.
[79:25.87]So Chris is currently on 8 squares, and Aggie is also on 8, but this will be his 9th.
[79:31.69]So this is an unbelievably close game heading into the last probably 20 or 30 minutes here.
[79:39.36]Yeah, it's cool how opposite their paths were.
[79:42.42]But at the same time, they're avoiding the same squares, so soon they're going to have to make some choices.
[79:49.14]Um, so I would guess Aggie would go to Mimic tier, maybe, right after this.
[79:56.34]Yeah, he's killed Radon.
[79:58.18]Maybe finish off Remembrances.
[80:02.16]Maybe he does Estelle into Remembrances.
[80:04.82]Ooh, that's a weird play.
[80:06.16]Yeah, there is that synergy.
[80:08.20]I really like seeing the good gamers fight Estelle.
[80:10.90]It's so awesome.
[80:11.78]I have a weird feeling they made a Gentleman's that we didn't hear about with the Lightning Ram at the end.
[80:17.00]They're both just going to go and rolling in at the end.
[80:21.46]We've got Chris.
[80:22.58]So it looks like Aggie might potentially be doing the Lightning Rams.
[80:25.95]Or he could be going to Capital, too.
[80:27.61]That's possible.
[80:29.53]Oh, Chris is picking up the Lightning Pot recipe here, which is the pot you have to use in order to do the Mimic tier cheese.
[80:36.07]But he doesn't have Redon open.
[80:37.35]Not like Redon will take him very long, but it is still something to get done.
[80:40.95]And then he's taking this bridge teleport to the other side.
[80:47.34]For what?
[80:48.84]Maybe he needs some resources for consumable Mimic Tear.
[80:51.78]Yeah, Folger Bloom or something?
[80:52.99]Yeah.
[80:54.17]So killing the Mimic Tear.
[80:56.03]Yeah.
[80:56.69]How many consumables?
[80:58.13]How hard is that?
[80:59.23]So Parky was mentioning earlier that there is a cheese that we have agreed as a community to allow where if you stand in a very specific spot, you know how Mimic Tear starts as a puddle before forming in?
[81:10.30]he transforms at a very specific spot in the arena, and if you stand just outside that and throw a lightning pot onto him, he has, like, one HP, basically, and dies before he can spawn.
[81:20.54]It's a little cheesy, but it works.
[81:23.07]Yeah, it's a little bit... Jury's a little out on whether or not it's hashtag cool.
[81:28.15]In my opinion, as much as it's good to have that because the fight sucks, I think the point of that square is to have a little bit of a difficult square.
[81:37.10]I agree.
[81:37.78]As I was saying, the consumable Mimic tier really sucks.
[81:41.60]Kukris and throwing knives are all you've got.
[81:43.92]It's brutal, and then you're going to run out.
[81:45.79]And
[81:46.37]The input reading in this game is on another level.
[81:49.91]It's crazy.
[81:50.43]Yeah, the NPC fights in this game are... I'm a huge hater of NPC fights in any Souls game.
[81:56.15]Just, like, get them out.
[81:57.92]I can go on... Like, no, don't get me started on this, but it sucks.
[82:00.70]Magnus Beastclaw ruins my life every single time.
[82:03.30]That's a tough NPC.
[82:04.62]Who was the NPC with the spray can and Bloodborne that was on the bridge?
[82:08.27]Oh, one of the... Yeah, that guy is rough.
[82:10.91]Dude, the Bloodborne NPCs are brutal.
[82:13.23]Okay, wait, I've got good news for all my gamers at home and my Ash of War Lightning Ram enjoyers.
[82:19.48]Chris is heading towards the Ash of War Lightning Ram right now.
[82:22.46]Our dreams are being fulfilled.
[82:23.62]This is what we care about.
[82:24.78]Everyone pay attention to Chris' screen here.
[82:27.10]This is the most epic square that we have in the movie.
[82:30.04]Oh, he's also picking up Fulgur Bloom, which you need to craft the lightning pods.
[82:33.31]So kind of, you know, a little bit of column A, column B here.
[82:35.45]That's nice.
[82:37.51]And yeah, Aggie looks like he's...
[82:39.78]Oh, yeah.
[82:40.38]Low key, they're racing on this.
[82:41.74]Yeah, Eggie looks like he's going towards... It's kind of the final fast square besides Leonine here.
[82:47.54]I don't know.
[82:48.06]I feel like maybe Leonine or Mimic Tear is the sauce here.
[82:51.96]I think they're going to probably contest Mimic Tear after, which Eggie... I mean, Eggie doesn't have the pause ready, but he does have Rigondon.
[82:58.51]So Chris needs to put the Ash of War Lightning Ram onto something.
[83:02.03]So he has to go back to Roundtable Hold in order to do that.
[83:04.63]He's just putting it on this rapier here.
[83:08.49]Lay out your arms, then.
[83:10.87]I love Hugh.
[83:11.99]He's good.
[83:13.85]But I prefer Andre.
[83:14.75]I was going to say, who's your favorite?
[83:16.41]When Andre's like, when he goes, neither one of us wants to see you go hollow.
[83:21.85]I'm like, I don't either, buddy.
[83:23.66]I'm a Demon's Souls enjoyer.
[83:25.28]You're souls.
[83:26.48]Oh, yeah.
[83:27.22]I love Ed.
[83:28.74]A big flame.
[83:29.76]Actually, that's it.
[83:31.30]That's the wrong.
[83:31.82]There's two.
[83:33.12]I said the other one.
[83:35.18]Yeah, they are racing for this.
[83:36.37]Yeah.
[83:39.15]That just means I get to see it twice and I love it.
[83:41.89]Okay, let's all count to 10 together, chat.
[83:44.59]This is an important skill check for players.
[83:46.76]They can play Elden Ring, they can hit the Skadric, they can beat the game, they can kill Malenia.
[83:50.40]Can they count to 10?
[83:51.16]That's a real question.
[83:51.80]Aggie actually, is he retiring this?
[83:54.96]No, he's still going for it.
[83:56.20]He's heading in.
[83:56.96]Yes, there's one.
[83:58.30]They're running away from Chris here.
[83:59.66]This is the best, yeah.
[84:01.32]Oh, he's got on Torrents.
[84:02.72]Okay.
[84:05.60]A little UCIC.
[84:07.32]I thought it killed him for a second.
[84:09.80]Alright, here we go.
[84:12.03]And two.
[84:18.21]Oh, crouching up.
[84:21.13]Oh!
[84:21.59]Okay, three, four.
[84:26.28]This is what you came to see.
[84:28.34]Five.
[84:28.86]Peak television.
[84:29.76]Uh-oh.
[84:32.58]Six.
[84:33.24]Oh, he just...
[84:35.59]Oh, Aggie's on two.
[84:37.49]Seven on Chris.
[84:38.95]Three for Aggie.
[84:39.95]This is the closest race we've seen.
[84:43.85]That's eight for Chris.
[84:44.82]Uh-oh, we could see an upset here.
[84:48.34]Four for Aggie.
[84:50.16]Nine.
[84:50.76]Oh, no.
[84:53.93]Six, seven.
[84:54.66]Oh!
[84:57.40]Wow, that was so close.
[85:02.19]That was brutal.
[85:03.23]This is why we do it.
[85:05.21]This is Eldy Ring.
[85:07.20]See, so when you get snipes like that, it's pretty hype usually.
[85:10.34]There were three sheep right there.
[85:13.48]That could have been crazy.
[85:14.18]That was less than a five-second snipe.
[85:16.64]Okay, back to Eldritch Horrors, beyond our comprehension.
[85:20.48]Oh my God, the sheeps are getting revenge.
[85:22.67]Yeah, that was a little bit of a time sink.
[85:26.63]So snipes like that hurt pretty bad usually.
[85:30.41]So that means Aggie is currently on nine and Chris is also on nine.
[85:35.90]We're all tied up here entering the one hour, five minute mark.
[85:38.62]Yeah, Aggie's heading into Landl probably.
[85:42.20]Yeah, this is interesting because everything that's left is decently long.
[85:49.59]Aggie knows he might have the priority on Mimic tier consumables only.
[85:52.87]Lee and I have Misbegotten open.
[85:53.97]Like Tevin was saying, that's a pretty quick goal.
[85:55.53]There's not a lot of investment, though it's a long running section.
[85:59.96]Yeah, so the good thing about getting Landil Axis, which Eggy is doing, is that you can do Moog Sewers like that, which is a pretty fast square.
[86:08.90]Morgott's Gray Rune, if it comes to it, yeah, you have access to that.
[86:13.94]You can get remembrances.
[86:15.26]I mean, yeah, these are kind of long squares.
[86:18.33]um but it's better to have the lando axis than to not there's also the interesting thing of like okay there's 25 squares if it's going to be 13 to 12 that means every square has to get marked right at some point right uh and that's only if it's as close as can be but both of our players do not want to do remembrance possible only yeah I was going to say where do they have a place for this at this point uh Chris has ranala available that might be the
[86:44.16]No, it's not going to happen.
[86:45.98]Aggie has Godrick, doesn't he?
[86:47.49]Aggie has Godrick.
[86:48.37]So what's going to happen is, like, Rennala, you can't really do it because of the first phase.
[86:53.27]It's just, like, not viable.
[86:54.81]Even if you wanted to try, the other player will get it.
[86:57.39]Aggie is probably – what players will do, Aggie probably knows that Chris has done it because Chris got four God Bosses square.
[87:04.57]And so Aggie is probably going to hold that until the end and just do it when –
[87:09.14]He needs an extra square because he knows that it's over.
[87:11.80]Okay, Aggie's going for a parry cheese here.
[87:13.84]Slap him on the butt.
[87:14.80]Goodbye, DTS.
[87:15.80]Oh, it didn't work.
[87:16.58]Didn't work.
[87:17.34]Okay, Aggie's going to have to potentially fight him legit.
[87:20.60]What the fuck?
[87:21.84]Don't stop.
[87:23.14]DTS cheese is banned in the rule set.
[87:24.86]Wait, is it?
[87:25.80]It's banned in Season 3 rule set.
[87:27.58]Yeah, I mean... Wait, we all hear each other now?
[87:31.72]No, we can't hear them.
[87:34.62]I think they can hear us a little bit when we're loud.
[87:38.08]Okay, so there is a Snake America here, so they'll be okay.
[87:40.76]It sounds like maybe they had a gentleman's agreement or something that is either being honored or not honored.
[87:45.82]Oh, this is the fight where I growled at somebody in my chat.
[87:47.86]Oh, yeah.
[87:50.10]I'm so interested in everything you have to say.
[87:53.15]Yeah, right?
[87:54.68]Every story is like weird dad lore.
[87:58.50]This is where I growled at that guy.
[87:59.64]This is where me and the snake found out about the flowers.
[88:02.15]I got stuck here for an hour or two.
[88:05.27]This place is super hard for how much damage scales upward.
[88:09.35]Oh, no.
[88:10.05]What is that damage that he has?
[88:12.01]Why does that look like that?
[88:13.05]It's the plus 16 Mantis Blade.
[88:14.97]I mean, it's just not going to give the damage output.
[88:17.39]Brutal.
[88:18.21]It's a short sword.
[88:18.95]I mean, it's just not.
[88:19.89]Oh, wow.
[88:20.71]See, so this is where the damage is so big.
[88:22.83]You guys saw Chris.
[88:23.65]I don't even see Chris fighting.
[88:25.27]That's how fast that was.
[88:26.55]The plus nine Falling Star Beast draw is just going to... The DPS is so much higher.
[88:29.77]Oh, my God.
[88:30.23]Brutal.
[88:32.32]There's going to be a lot of making up time for Chris.
[88:35.36]He might start to... Yeah, as these later game bosses, the damage is going to matter so much more.
[88:40.42]Yeah.
[88:42.28]And they're both equally good on most of these fights.
[88:45.29]So it is tough.
[88:46.41]I can see Chris going for Moog Seeress here.
[88:48.51]And now, I mean, this doesn't really happen in Bingo usually, but they know just because of the fact that we're all next to each other, they know that they're on the same spot.
[88:55.80]So there's a little bit of weird pressure probably on Aggie here.
[89:00.71]and a little bit of relief on Chris.
[89:02.47]Also, Chris calling out a rule thing when he marked a goal 10 minutes late.
[89:06.33]Okay, buddy.
[89:07.51]Okay, buddy.
[89:08.81]If I was that guy, I'd be like, yeah, man, I'm just going to not follow that since we're just freestyling today.
[89:15.25]Yeah.
[89:15.97]Well, it's all for charity.
[89:18.61]It's all for charity, guys.
[89:20.79]Get those donations in.
[89:22.63]Every dollar goes towards a good cause.
[89:24.85]We will cheat on a game for charity.
[89:26.25]Let me tell you, if it's funny, we'll do it.
[89:28.82]Noticing that the heal from the flask is about four centimeters.
[89:34.34]Yeah, because that's the thing.
[89:35.70]It wastes time to go pick up flask upgrades, right?
[89:38.26]They're out of the way.
[89:39.07]Sacred Tears.
[89:40.99]Yeah.
[89:44.51]Damn, this is getting a little stressful.
[89:46.77]You're going to have to drink the whole bottle to fill up your health bar.
[89:49.09]Yeah, literally.
[89:49.93]I mean, that's the thing with having a lot of HP bar.
[89:52.53]Oh, that's the one.
[89:53.25]You hate to see that.
[89:54.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[89:56.38]Is Aggie out of heals?
[89:58.22]he is I think but not out of options not out of options I mean I if you guys don't know aggie no hit randall this game so he did a randomizer and he no hit it and he beat the game like that wow so he has a lot of experience on no hitting bosses um obviously things happen and some weapons are bad but a stagger would be huge for aggie that would probably finish it okay so this is not the attack you want to see oh ah
[90:31.79]There's a lot of variance to Draconic Crescendo as well.
[90:34.40]The amount of ways he can swing fast or slow.
[90:37.64]No, dude.
[90:38.98]Okay, that attack, not only, okay, the wind up in Elden Ring, can we talk about it for a second?
[90:43.70]But also then the AOE afterwards, no good.
[90:46.16]Dude, so many damn bosses in this game.
[90:48.71]And I literally knew that this was going to happen because of this shitty-ass lightning thing.
[90:53.13]Like, it's just like wild.
[90:55.79]Dude, imagine if an MLB pitcher did his little thing and then pulled his arm to here.
[91:00.58]Yeah.
[91:00.94]and waited for 10 seconds.
[91:02.80]There are pictures that do that.
[91:04.52]Really?
[91:05.38]They can sit there and hold it.
[91:06.52]There's one guy who doubles his foot.
[91:08.81]He'll do a serpent movement.
[91:11.15]No, we don't need that.
[91:12.03]I think Cadeo Nomo.
[91:12.95]That's crazy.
[91:13.71]I think it's the variance, too, of the here it comes.
[91:16.86]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[91:17.54]Here's two more.
[91:18.10]Yeah, yeah.
[91:19.78]you know who yeah so Margaret Margaret does a lot of delays and we all know that but Margaret has one specific move he'll hold it up and and we know like there's specific ways to fight him kind of scripted and you're doing it and you're like okay Margaret okay and he's like yeah he's like and you're like okay I know this fight you're supposed to hit now and then he will just cancel it and you're like okay
[91:41.01]Yeah, Makar is the one that always gets me with that slow ass.
[91:43.95]Oh, yeah.
[91:44.51]And it looks, I swear to God, he goes, eh?
[91:46.45]And then he rolls and he, ah!
[91:49.14]No, he does, though.
[91:50.02]He does.
[91:50.26]Gotcha, bitch.
[91:51.28]Yeah, no, no, it's brutal.
[91:52.78]If they start adding flinch bosses in this bitch, I swear.
[91:55.70]That's why the DLC scares the shit out of me.
[91:58.74]We are going to get in the DLC a boss that actually probably stands there with a baseball glove.
[92:05.17]Yeah.
[92:06.99]It's just your dad, he goes... Yeah, there's going to be like, I'm going to hit you.
[92:12.26]And then when you roll, he laughs and then hits you.
[92:15.92]It's just Shao Kahn.
[92:17.28]He's like, you suck.
[92:19.49]Yeah, no, it's brutal.
[92:20.61]And I think that, yeah, we should all be terrified of the DLC because if you've played like Dark Souls 1, it's so easy relatively because you go from Elden Ring and you go to Dark Souls 1 and you're like, what?
[92:31.88]We don't know about delays in Dark Souls 1.
[92:33.44]What?
[92:34.12]Like, this is so crazy and different.
[92:36.30]I played Dark Souls 2 again recently, and it's crazy just how different.
[92:40.74]The enemies in Dark Souls 2 are like, I am a swing, swing, swing.
[92:46.28]It's almost like, I want to say robotic in a way.
[92:49.57]And then you get to Elden Ring, you get to Bloodborne and beyond, it's like... Oh my god, it's brutal.
[92:55.73]Fortisax.
[92:57.74]Yeah, it's crazy.
[92:58.70]But you can't even be mad a lot of the time because you're just like, wow.
[93:01.73]Yeah, the spectacle.
[93:02.77]The first time you go to Hoarah Loux and he just throws you up and just slams you down and you're like, wow.
[93:08.13]Okay, that's like... That anime.
[93:09.61]You're projecting.
[93:10.37]No, no.
[93:11.91]No, that fight is so good.
[93:13.22]She bestowed her breath on that one.
[93:15.36]That was like...
[93:16.36]Her own personal thing going on.
[93:18.24]I believe I put the Hoarah Loux fight in a S tier.
[93:21.26]Yes!
[93:22.02]Amen.
[93:23.08]That and Maliketh are my two favorites.
[93:25.53]Oh, I'm not a big Maliketh fan.
[93:27.91]When he literally enters beast mode, I'm like, yeah, you're my guy now.
[93:32.99]That cutscene is pretty dope.
[93:33.89]The cutscene between Godfrey and Hoarah Loux, I love so much.
[93:38.36]It's so cool.
[93:41.63]What are the scores looking like here?
[93:42.97]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9?
[93:43.70]10, 9, potentially?
[93:44.38]We've got 9 for Aggie and 9 for Crystal, so it's still 9 all.
[93:52.07]So, yeah, Aggie looks like he's in this little bit of a thing that happens with Elden Ring Bingo when, like, you know you should have got it the first time, and then this happens, and this happens, and, like... Oh, my God.
[94:02.06]Oh, my God.
[94:02.34]Yeah, you start getting hit to this bullshit that you shouldn't be getting hit to, and it just, like... That's where the mental stuff comes in, right?
[94:08.59]Like, it's just... It's brutal.
[94:10.21]Yeah, this is the snowballing we're talking about.
[94:11.71]Sometimes you have what we call... In the business, we call it an incident.
[94:15.17]Yeah.
[94:16.31]A DTS incident.
[94:17.55]A DTS incident is taking place.
[94:21.68]You got to have an incident.
[94:22.80]You do, you do, you do.
[94:24.10]So here we have Morgott, who, if you don't know, is Margit.
[94:28.80]Why are you spoiling a game?
[94:30.83]Okay, so I'm not a big lore person of this game, but basically it's like Margit was like, haha, I'm actually Morgott, but I'm just going to change one letter and you're not going to know.
[94:40.13]And now he's like, haha, this is actually me.
[94:41.95]And you never knew that.
[94:43.13]I think that he...
[94:46.11]Shows up a third time.
[94:46.87]It's like on some Clark Kent shit where he's like doing, or like Batman, where he's like doing nefarious shit as Margot.
[94:53.40]And he's like, now I'm playing as Margot.
[94:55.32]But it doesn't matter because all the people in the Golden Order fucking hate him anyway.
[94:58.90]It's like, you're ugly, boo, spit.
[95:01.17]Like, it doesn't matter.
[95:03.01]Yeah, we also have Ronnie do the same thing.
[95:05.33]The first time you meet her, she's like, I'm Renna.
[95:07.75]And you're like, what?
[95:08.84]And she looks the same and everything.
[95:10.02]Okay, what's going on with Irina or the Hayeda?
[95:13.34]What is the, what's the, what the fuck is the Two Fingers?
[95:16.07]You know what I mean?
[95:18.63]Yeah, I don't get that one at all.
[95:21.31]I avoid that quest every time.
[95:23.19]I hate talking to them.
[95:24.17]But Irena is like the vessel.
[95:26.01]She's like a puppet or something?
[95:26.96]Hiena is like the bad thing.
[95:28.58]Dude, I swear to God, you meet an NPC called Billy Bob the Builder.
[95:33.56]And Billy Bob the Builder is like, hello, it's so nice to meet you.
[95:35.48]I've been a builder for 20 years.
[95:36.78]And then you read an item description.
[95:37.92]It's like, Billy Bob the Builder was convicted of murdering 40 children.
[95:41.46]He ate their corpses and he didn't care.
[95:43.28]And it's like, oh my God.
[95:44.55]You're in Shabrir.
[95:45.53]You're like, what the fuck is this?
[95:47.75]I love the lore, though.
[95:48.79]The whole thing with the omens.
[95:50.39]Oh, yeah.
[95:51.05]There's a whole... I could watch a thousand hours of Elden Ring lore videos, and then a week later, I'm just like, shit, what happened?
[96:00.97]Okay, alright, so you've got the Golden Order, and then you've got America.
[96:06.41]Vaati got the world in a chokehold.
[96:08.35]Yeah, but what I don't love, I'm not personally a great kind of memory person, so I'm like, alright, so we've got...
[96:16.11]We got Malenia, we got Melina, we got Godfrey, we got other Godfrey, we got Godfroy, we got Godrick, we got-
[96:16.11]We got, you know Margrit, we got Morgott-
[96:26.11]Godwyn, the Godwyn yeah - you know spoiler alert yeah the the Godwyn that you can find in a few places, whoa.
[96:33.11]I'm looking forward to learning more about that.
[96:35.11]I mean yeah it's just like the names are like- it's cause G R R M, that's why they did it but like come on guys.
[96:41.87]I've seen so many Elden Ring lore videos, and I still don't understand Radagon-Marika.
[96:46.37]That shit is beyond me.
[96:48.39]Godfrey ruined my life.
[96:50.65]When I opened the Average Jump, I was like, I hate this.
[96:54.03]I hate you.
[96:54.91]I hate everything about this.
[96:56.56]Listen, I'm like, when people say, oh, Elden Ring reuses bosses, I'm like, no, no, no, it's valid.
[97:02.12]It's an open world game, whatever.
[97:03.00]But I'm like... really guys?
[97:04.04]Yeah.
[97:04.64]Because Godfroy I'm like okay chat what's the lore then? If this is such a normal boss, what's the fucking lore?
[97:08.00]That's a remembrance boss.
[97:10.00]There's like well- wait are you talking about...?
[97:12.00]Yeah I'm talking about Godfroy but like the fact that he's just cloned in the same way.
[97:18.00]And he also is like neutered like, he doesn't have any of the second phase sauce like at all.
[97:21.00]No, it's like- it's like okay guys, like really? And- and yeah I don't think he even has lore I think it's just like a little buddy.
[97:27.00]Somebody once told me he was uh Godfrey's uncle.
[97:30.55]Yeah, someone told me that too. It's probably true then.
[97:32.55]Fun fact: one of the ashes, one of the legendary ashes actually beat him. He was a general of some sort and one of the ashes beat him and put him in that gaol. One of the Leyndell uh-
[97:45.55]And he just happens to look exactly like his nephew. Talk- and has the same voice lines.
[97:52.42]So Chris is heading towards Astel here.
[97:54.88]Meanwhile, Aggie's heading down into the sewers.
[97:58.07]So that DTS maybe doesn't matter so much because Chris really only gets the Morgott progress on Aggie here.
[98:05.85]And Aggie still has precedence here on Mimic tier consumables only.
[98:10.99]So, again, let's say this does come down to, like, one square, and, like, Chris kind of cannot get the bow remembrance boss.
[98:19.80]Yeah, true, yeah.
[98:20.96]So I think Aggie's using that as a little bit of a cushion, right?
[98:24.14]Potentially, yeah.
[98:25.05]Yeah, yeah.
[98:26.27]I was thinking about this earlier, I think Kris is holding Leona and Misfogotten in that same way where as soon as he sees like, oh the boss or the bow is becoming the thing he's gonna start targeting, I need to pivot and go to Leona and Misfogotten because that's the same ease.
[98:40.12]Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.
[98:42.22]So, yeah, we'll see here.
[98:43.08]I love fighting Estelle with Colossal Weapons.
[98:45.41]I think it's actually a lot of fun to get the staggers on him.
[98:47.59]This is also another Remembrance boss for Chris here, which will be his fourth because he's done Morgat, Godfrey, Rennala, or not Rennala.
[98:55.75]Godrick.
[98:57.35]Or, yeah, it was, pardon me, Godrick.
[98:58.96]Rennala Rycard.
[99:00.56]Wait, doesn't he have four already?
[99:02.76]No, this will be his fourth.
[99:03.60]He didn't do Rennala.
[99:04.30]That was Aggie.
[99:05.76]I forget Astel does have a Remembrance.
[99:07.62]Yeah, only this one, though.
[99:08.84]The other Astel in Consecrated Snowfield does not have one.
[99:10.98]The harder one?
[99:11.55]Yeah, the harder one does not have a Remembrance.
[99:12.87]Which is weird, yeah.
[99:14.45]Speaking of sound effects,
[99:15.93]All the Estelle sounds are crazy.
[99:18.67]When they lift you up and that sound and they're about to smack the shit out of you.
[99:24.25]Oh, I love it.
[99:25.39]I love the pincers, like when it's... I just love, you know, the meddling of the gods.
[99:31.76]It's beautiful.
[99:33.89]So Eggie is on his way to Moog's sewers, which by the way, I am of the opinion that Moog in the sewers is almost a more fun fight than real Moog.
[99:43.60]I agree.
[99:44.44]Maybe not the music and the theatrics and all that, but it's like the good parts of Moog.
[99:49.10]And I feel the same way about Goldfree versus Godfree.
[99:52.18]It's like all the fun parts about Godfree, just in a little package.
[99:56.76]Oh, this is Moog's sewer skip from Aggie.
[99:59.22]Well done.
[100:01.32]So that saves a couple minutes of movement around the sewers.
[100:05.19]I don't know about minutes.
[100:06.13]It's fast.
[100:06.91]I think it's minutes.
[100:08.47]They don't know.
[100:09.51]Just make up a number and say it.
[100:11.17]That saves an hour, Chad.
[100:12.45]He's back in the run.
[100:13.19]Yeah.
[100:18.83]Okay, so oftentimes when it starts getting to this point, the players start thinking about win conditions.
[100:23.10]Like, what do I have to get in order to win?
[100:24.70]What can I get in order to win?
[100:27.06]So I'm curious what they're thinking of here.
[100:28.62]Did Kris just get that Estelle?
[100:29.88]Yeah, Kris just got the remembrances.
[100:31.52]So now Aggie's heading into Sewer Moog, and then Kris is going to be uncontested on Morgott's Great Runes.
[100:38.39]That would put Kris at 11 points, meaning Aggie's going to have to pick up consumables only, and he knows Kris might have a little bit of priority here on Estelle.
[100:46.93]I think he also thinks Chris has priority on Morgott.
[100:49.61]Yeah, probably, because he died to DTS so many times.
[100:52.14]Yeah, this almost assures that Aggie has to go for Mimic tier, Leonine, Misbegotten, and Bow all the way.
[100:58.00]Well, so Chris is going for Leonine, Misbegotten right now.
[101:00.43]He's running in there right now.
[101:02.03]This is starting to look like a...
[101:04.01]a setup for a victory but as we like to say it's not over till it's over honestly as as crazy as some times maybe you're like how how would this guy ever lose like you can have incidences on anything you can it's like a classic I've never seen that move before how did I die well this game is goofy yeah anything anything can happen yeah yeah yeah so it's not over till it's over
[101:24.04]And honestly, for me, it's always such a treat to watch two really talented players like this fight bosses that I myself struggle with.
[101:30.54]Like, this is going to be, you know, a Moog masterclass, basically.
[101:34.82]They have traded blows back and forth on this several times.
[101:37.94]Like, these are...
[101:40.13]the two LeBrons of Elden Ring.
[101:44.44]Gamers in chat, I don't know if we have mods in either chat that could post links, but both of these guys have YouTube channels and Twitch pages, and they're both streaming, posting banger videos all the time.
[101:54.08]Lilaggy and StarZeroChris, you can find them on everything.
[101:57.34]Literally, some of the, if not the best Elden Ring players in the world, they're just incredible to watch.
[102:04.50]And just look how focused.
[102:05.58]Look at the focus.
[102:06.56]Look at the gamer focus.
[102:09.49]Just not a smile in sight.
[102:13.74]The best thing about these games, though, is a lot of times you need to lock it.
[102:18.24]You're just laser.
[102:20.30]And then you beat the boss and you're like, I'm so happy.
[102:23.24]You get off of a shift of Elden Ring.
[102:26.86]I got to go to the goddamn office tonight.
[102:28.48]You go to the bathroom and you lean over the seat and you're like, Malenia's not going to kill herself.
[102:33.51]Another eight hours in the old mines.
[102:36.07]It's like, guys, look how much we love Elden Ring.
[102:38.03]Honey, I got to put food on the table sometime.
[102:41.63]Especially when like you do what these guys do like they've talked about the challenge runs like ten times the enemies or like triple bosses and shit like you think one Malenia sucks imagine four water fowls in your ass.
[102:52.40]Yeah.
[102:55.20]It's brutal.
[102:55.72]I hate that move.
[102:56.98]That move is like the worst move ever.
[102:58.92]Which one was that?
[102:59.74]The water fowl.
[103:01.28]Oh, the water fowl.
[103:02.36]Oh, yeah.
[103:02.86]Oh, yeah.
[103:03.24]Classic.
[103:04.54]I love that the first time we all saw it, everyone immediately had the same response, like, no, you can't do anything about that.
[103:10.66]There's literally nothing to do about that.
[103:12.68]Even the players who know how to dodge it occasionally get caught and are just like, man.
[103:16.61]Yeah, like, the strat for, like, the players who know is, like, you have to be a perfect distance away.
[103:21.43]Too close is too close, she'll kill you.
[103:23.43]Too far is, like, too far.
[103:25.51]Unless you're, like, really, really far to not even touch you, but, like, to dodge it, you really have to be in, like, a perfect distance.
[103:32.71]I truly think without that move, it's a perfect fight.
[103:35.49]Oh, it is beautiful.
[103:36.05]You either get rid of that or the, like, the heals still, uh, steal.
[103:39.91]Yeah.
[103:40.60]You know what, though?
[103:41.36]I am kind of a believer of, like, people are like, oh, well, you can't dodge her and it's bullshit or whatever, but I believe in the fact that, like, an art of the fight is being able to AI manip and stay far away so that she doesn't catch you and
[103:55.22]Maybe you don't have to learn it, but you have to be aware to stay far enough away so it doesn't kill you.
[103:59.42]You believe way too much in the human spirit.
[104:01.49]Yeah.
[104:01.79]I pulled out Mimic Tear and we got the ass blasted.
[104:04.95]I think I just said it over and over again.
[104:08.69]What were they thinking?
[104:09.47]That's exactly what I said.
[104:12.13]Anyway, Leonine is dead.
[104:13.93]Yeah, we blinked and Leonine is dead.
[104:15.59]There it is.
[104:16.09]So Aggie wasn't even on his way to Leonine, so he's not too worried.
[104:20.83]That's 11 squares for Chris and 10 for Aggie.
[104:23.61]So reminder, it is 13 to win.
[104:25.29]There are no open bingo lines, which means it's going to have to be square majority here.
[104:29.40]We've got four squares left.
[104:30.66]Chris needs two of them.
[104:31.74]Aggie needs three of them.
[104:33.19]Aggie is collecting the setup for Mimic tier consumable only.
[104:36.50]Chris is on his way to a stealth.
[104:38.22]Aggie knows he has bow only.
[104:39.82]Chris knows he has Morgott.
[104:42.32]So... Yeah, it's just the putting away squares.
[104:47.15]I think this will matter a little bit on if someone has an incident or how fast things go.
[104:54.17]But either way, I mean, a really, really nice game.
[104:56.09]A really nice showcase of Elden Ring Bingo, I think.
[104:59.56]So the really cool thing about this, this is the first time I've ever seen this.
[105:04.42]Oh yeah, so this could be anything on this board.
[105:08.14]This could be go talk to an NPC.
[105:09.94]This could be go kill a random enemy or something in the mountain somewhere.
[105:15.24]There's just so many different things that this could be.
[105:17.92]Yeah, we basically, as a community, just over time, doing lots of races, picked the goals that we thought not only, okay, these are decently hard, but also that are fun.
[105:28.03]Like, you know, we want a good amount of the squares.
[105:30.01]There are some bad ones, sure, you know, that you got to have a little bit of unfortunate stuff, but for the most part, it's, yeah, there's like hundreds of goals that we decided, okay, these are the fun ones that mesh well together and are exciting to watch.
[105:41.74]Yeah, I do wish that this specific board, I wish we got a little more of some of the other variety.
[105:45.90]Like, we got a lot of bosses in here, which is always really fun, but just for the sake of the showcase, I wish we got a little more of the other stuff.
[105:51.23]That just means I got to watch more bingo.
[105:52.53]That's so true.
[105:53.45]We have leagues and they are just unbelievable.
[105:56.33]Yeah, we have this, like I mentioned before, Bingo Brawlers, which is the bingo league for Elden Ring run by Captain Domo.
[106:02.84]And it's just so much fun to play in and watch.
[106:05.76]Oh my God, it's so much fun to watch.
[106:07.06]People will like set time aside to watch it.
[106:09.86]It's like sports.
[106:10.84]It's like, why do you guys watch sports?
[106:12.56]Well, why do you guys watch bingo?
[106:13.86]It's like that sort of thing.
[106:14.80]And Domo has really spearheaded getting the goals laid down, the mods that both players are using today on stream.
[106:22.41]He got those going.
[106:24.45]So it's really exciting to see Bingo developing.
[106:27.54]Oh yeah, it's so fun.
[106:29.16]And especially if you can follow it and you know, and like you usually watch it and there's commentators to help, but it's fun to follow.
[106:35.46]How long has this been going on for?
[106:37.59]Bingo Brawlers season one was like a year and a half ago.
[106:40.55]And we just finished season three.
[106:42.25]So it's like every six to nine months there will be a season.
[106:45.17]There will be one short after the DLC.
[106:46.89]If anyone's interested in watching, that will be on Domo's channel.
[106:50.79]I think there's also another league for no-hit, right?
[106:54.81]Yeah, the zero-hit league.
[106:58.21]There's tons of cool stuff happening in the Elden Ring and just FromSoft community in general.
[107:04.01]It's really, really cool to see.
[107:05.07]And we've got all manner of players.
[107:06.79]We've got players that do primarily challenge runs participating.
[107:09.17]We've got speed runners participating.
[107:10.97]Yeah, and you know what is so fun about Bingo, and I'm sure this goes for all games that do Bingo, is that it's really cool to see the way speedrunners play Bingo versus the way challenge runners play Bingo and whatever, because Bingo is such its own skill set, and you can use things that you know, obviously, to help, but you can be good at speedrunning the game but be horrible, horrible at Bingo.
[107:35.73]There are so many new things you have to know, but it's also cool to see this one person is a speedrunner, and so they might be bad at the boss squares, but they're really, really good at the pick up these things and pick up these things squares.
[107:48.78]And it's so much variety, and each player excels.
[107:51.64]It's so cool to see each player excel and what they're good at.
[107:56.24]It's so fun.
[107:56.96]So, by the way, Eggie is about to get to mimic Tyr here.
[108:00.47]Yeah, and meanwhile, Chris is about to mark, so long as there's no last-minute incident.
[108:04.59]Surely not, right?
[108:06.09]Surely not.
[108:06.91]He can probably finish it with the... The cursing you guys are doing is insane.
[108:09.73]Dude, it's brutal.
[108:10.59]I'm just in for a nice match.
[108:13.45]I would hate for the internet to go out.
[108:17.24]yeah he's he's got that alright there we go that's another square for Chris putting Chris in winning position here that is I believe 12 for 12 yeah I mean he's about to go get that Morgan's gray rooms yeah so this is aggie's got to get these uh this remembrance boss bow only here's the mimic cure consumables only so he's going to set up every player has a little bit of a different setup here for this uh looks like he's just kind of free balling it oh
[108:41.59]Just kind of, just kind of saucing it up here.
[108:43.75]Alright.
[108:44.67]There we go.
[108:45.25]That trajectory.
[108:46.37]Aggie has to get this and bow only before Chris can get Morgott's Gray Rune.
[108:50.47]And honestly, it's like kind of doable.
[108:52.70]Yeah, I agree.
[108:53.48]It's like super doable.
[108:55.10]Oh, God.
[108:55.94]Because Godrick is really easy.
[108:57.08]The only thing Aggie needs is a bow, right?
[108:59.26]Oh, wait.
[108:59.54]Does Aggie have 11 or 12?
[109:00.70]Because if Aggie only has 11, then this might be a sunk ship.
[109:03.94]yeah this is 11 that would be his 12th right no he has oh does he have yeah he has 11. he has 11 right now oh so it's not yeah so I think this might unfortunately be gg but of course that only is if Chris is able to get there yeah there is a boss standing between Chris and that square so it's not free and it's getting it off there imagine we just threw that in there
[109:29.68]And now comes the weird portion where we all get up and start yelling at Chris right next to him to make him nervous.
[109:36.98]No, Chris will be fine.
[109:38.60]So, yeah, Aggie is heading up to Morgott here.
[109:42.82]If he did Morgott bow only, then we'd have a little synergy here.
[109:46.86]You know what?
[109:47.45]This does happen sometimes.
[109:48.79]Like, Aggie knows that he needs both of those to win.
[109:51.13]Maybe he would do Morgott bow.
[109:52.63]Yeah, you never know.
[109:53.61]Because he knows Morgott.
[109:55.01]It just, you know, do you have enough damage or whatever?
[109:56.81]If that happens, this is, like, the most legendary shit I've seen pulled off.
[109:59.83]Like, this is a Michael Jordan-esque.
[110:01.38]This would be such a comeback.
[110:02.38]This is a flu game.
[110:03.40]Like, we're going to...
[110:04.32]well like put his name in the right he's not on his way to Godrick so does he have I want to see it honestly like okay I mean I would say if if eggy had a really strong weapon I think maybe he I don't know I mean not really but it's at this point I don't know what he's thinking if he if he's actually considering doing bow only like it's actually
[110:26.60]I mean, it's not impossible, but the issue with this is kind of, it's very unlikely to have an incident with the Fel Twins, and it's just a lot of running, not too much RNG in running.
[110:36.31]So Chris is going to have to go past this elevator towards the Divine Tower here, and the Fel Twins boss is standing between him and Victory.
[110:46.81]Yeah, the Fel Twins, if you guys don't exactly know what that is, anyone watching, it's that random ass fight in the darkness that you're like, what the hell is that?
[110:54.44]And you fight them to get to Morgott's Great Runes.
[110:57.50]It's like a weird Four Kings.
[110:59.16]It's like Four Kings, yeah.
[111:00.94]I think it's like a weird symbolic thing, like Morgott and Moog.
[111:06.66]It's like empty in your brain or something.
[111:08.26]There is actually some sort of lore with that or something.
[111:11.76]I don't actually know.
[111:12.69]Okay, now Aggie is heading towards Godrick.
[111:14.45]Okay, yeah.
[111:18.47]Yeah, so here is the Fel Twins.
[111:19.99]I wonder if it is an homage to Four Kings.
[111:25.04]I love how if you're slow, Four Kings can be Five Kings.
[111:27.60]Yeah, I think it can be more.
[111:28.92]Yeah, it can be like Infinite Kings.
[111:30.36]Infinite Kings.
[111:31.04]When I saw that, I was like, what the hell, guys?
[111:35.19]Just name it Kings.
[111:39.00]I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty upset at the damage on Aggie's weapon for a plus 16.
[111:44.10]Yeah, I feel like the damage output might have been the difference maker here.
[111:47.92]I mean, just look at how much damage Kris is doing.
[111:50.77]I think if Aggie had more damage, DTS and everything after would have been totally different.
[111:56.06]Is there a regular weapon at plus 16 that you think would even be in that kind of round?
[112:01.28]Iron Balls or Starfists.
[112:04.93]Those might as well be legendary weapons at their own right at this point.
[112:07.63]There are good ones.
[112:09.75]they're the naginata is good that's just that uchi gata is alright most of the bleeding ones are nice I used the astle remembrance weapon oh yeah the wing of the cell baby right now the baby right oh that yeah that thing was pretty awesome oh yeah at least that's what everybody told me
[112:28.59]I did pretty well with it.
[112:30.65]It's not about the weapon, it's about the user.
[112:33.88]The weapon art, it just blows the screen.
[112:35.60]It's not about the weapon art, it's about you.
[112:36.96]We're trying to give you props.
[112:38.52]No, but the weapon art, you know, it's... Oh, it is beautiful.
[112:41.54]The nebula, that's what it's called, right?
[112:44.18]If you're not anything without the suit, then you're nothing at all, right?
[112:47.87]I think Iron Man said those words.
[112:50.81]Jerma, do you see yourself more as Iron Man or Spider-Man?
[112:54.05]I think I'm a Mysterio.
[112:55.41]Oh, wow.
[112:56.13]Okay, nice.
[112:57.23]You are a Mysterio.
[112:58.81]Absolutely.
[112:59.23]That's my favorite character.
[113:00.17]Yeah.
[113:02.75]Chris riding the elevator up.
[113:03.89]This will be it unless, you know, something unbelievable takes place.
[113:08.61]Maybe he falls off or maybe the game just dies.
[113:11.03]That happens sometimes.
[113:13.37]Parky and I just actively throwing medieval curses onto Chris's machine.
[113:17.67]Everyone send in the curse of Raw with your donations.
[113:19.85]Please, we need to stop Chris.
[113:21.78]He is the monkey killer.
[113:24.50]The computer just goes like... I think Aggie's just playing around.
[113:28.52]Oh, he got the bow, the crossbow, full moon crossbow there.
[113:31.96]So crossbow counts as a bow weapon type here.
[113:34.36]I like that he, I mean, even if he doesn't know, just the never giving up attitude.
[113:39.67]Oh, yeah.
[113:39.99]Oh, yeah.
[113:40.35]You got to.
[113:41.53]I mean, this is obviously looking like Chris's favorite, but, like, it's not over until it's over, right?
[113:45.78]Like, things happen.
[113:46.62]It is right now.
[113:47.26]It is over now.
[113:48.40]Always, always run it out through first base, right?
[113:50.90]Because you never know.
[113:51.78]There we go.
[113:52.16]Jeez, boys.
[113:57.93]Producers, if we could get audio from us back in Chris and Aggie's headsets, that would be... Oh, amazing.
[114:03.50]That was a fantastic run.
[114:06.20]Yeah, gamers, how do you feel?
[114:08.28]The last square.
[114:09.06]They can't hear us yet.
[114:10.55]It was a fun board.
[114:11.75]No, we can hear you guys.
[114:12.65]Yeah, we got you.
[114:14.79]Uh, yeah, that was a board.
[114:15.83]A lot of bosses.
[114:17.27]Unfortunate damage output on your side, Aggie, for a boss board like this.
[114:21.63]What weapon were you using?
[114:22.72]I just had the Mantis Blade.
[114:23.86]Oh, yeah, that's... Yeah, so I actually got a Dragon Halberd, and I was going to switch over and go with Stealth, but then you went with Stealth, and I knew you had more guns.
[114:31.36]Yeah, I had Falling Star Beast Jaw from the 5-6 cave, yeah.
[114:35.37]That's pretty good.
[114:37.17]So I'm curious, you know, we had a lot of, you know, hot-seated discussion about one particular goal, and I'm curious why you guys left it so long and then gave us the race of a lifetime.
[114:45.56]Ashen Boar, Lightning Ram, thoughts, concerns?
[114:49.16]That was really close, Chris.
[114:50.51]It's just a little too far out of the way.
[114:53.29]After I got it, Aggie's like, you piece of shit.
[114:57.30]Yeah I was on 7 I think when he got you.
[114:59.30]Yeah there were three right next to you.
[115:07.00]Yeah there was a point where it was just like there was like three in a row and we were like: Oh shit I actually might get it.
[115:12.00]Yeah it's fun to do that square I mean yeah that square it's like you leave open until it's like okay I could go snag this now and like you know their mother like the lightning pot recipe things on the way so like maybe I go do that but-
[115:25.69]Yeah, after I was into the capital, I'm like, okay, let me just do these squares that I already have and then finish that out.
[115:31.06]Because you guys have played each other so many times and know each other's rapport, did you guys know that you were doing Sombra and you were going to do Smithing Stones?
[115:38.22]No.
[115:38.28]That's kind of just a coin flip.
[115:40.79]It was so weird how perfectly...
[115:43.27]symmetrical you guys decided to do your board.
[115:46.85]It was incredible.
[115:47.41]There was truly no overlap in the first 30 or 40 minutes.
[115:51.11]You got to see it, honestly.
[115:52.61]It can be really rough if you're doing the same thing, but one person's like 10 seconds faster.
[115:56.39]So you did Radon Hitless?
[115:57.57]Yeah.
[115:58.47]Did you summon the boys?
[115:59.81]I did summon the boys.
[116:00.66]I did a Rock Grease and then I died, so I just summoned the second one.
[116:04.62]I mean, this was an incredibly close match, guys.
[116:06.28]You should be really proud of this.
[116:07.70]In a live event setting, this is really impressive.
[116:09.90]There was only one square left.
[116:11.58]Yeah.
[116:13.41]Do you think that was the Draconic Tree Sentinel moment that kind of put the... Dude, okay, so I... Yeah, I went for a cheese first, and I really had a medium shield, which is, like, pretty bad for parrying.
[116:24.06]And I actually got it, and then he didn't get knocked off.
[116:26.91]So at that point, I'm like, okay, I know my damage is bad, and I know this guy is going to kick my ass, but I didn't really have a choice in the matter.
[116:34.45]So yeah, that definitely probably made a bit of a difference.
[116:36.71]And then the situation with you, Chris.
[116:39.02]Marking a square a little bit.
[116:43.08]I mean, you know, we do a little cheating out here.
[116:47.17]I love how you, Marcus, were like 20 minutes late and then you were like, Aggie, you can't cheese DTS.
[116:50.77]Aggie, you should have done it.
[116:53.05]You should have done it.
[116:54.97]I mean, you got to fight the boss.
[116:56.59]That's how you catch a dove right there.
[116:58.37]You cheat and prevent others from cheating.
[117:01.89]Well, do you guys have any shout outs?
[117:03.40]Like, you know, shout yourselves out.
[117:05.06]YouTube.com slash Lil Aggie.
[117:06.90]He is great.
[117:08.20]And his Twitch as well.
[117:09.70]Love watching his stream.
[117:10.82]He has my most watched stream of 2023.
[117:14.64]Much love.
[117:15.58]And of course, youtube.com slash StarZero, Chris.
[117:19.72]And also another additional shout out to Mr. Captain Domo.
[117:23.32]He's the head of the Bingo Brothers League and really put a lot of effort into this and commissioned this mod we're using today for this.
[117:30.21]Huge shout out to him.
[117:33.31]Yep.
[117:34.01]fantastic well that was awesome to watch that's the first time like I said you probably couldn't hear me but that I've never seen this before so that was awesome that was quite a display it's something to jump into for sure like a lot but it's cool to I think we got to show off a good amount of stuff like a good amount of boss and stuff no Malenia yeah I was thinking about it yeah you could I mean we actually mentioned that we were like I wonder if they're gonna do it for the flex
[117:58.33]For the god boss, I was hoping you'd do it.
[118:00.17]Yeah, I just didn't... I wasn't sure I could beat her in three minutes with my physic, so I didn't have the stats to keep using my weapon if I timed out.
[118:08.10]So I was like, it's not worth it.
[118:09.96]Yeah, totally fair.
[118:10.76]Soldier of Godrick was a close second.
[118:12.42]Yeah, it was a tough fight too.
[118:13.96]Tough.
[118:15.56]Yeah, can we just find out about the Topps?
[118:18.64]Can you do the bubble for them?
[118:20.10]Oh, yeah.
[118:20.58]Okay, there is a spell.
[118:21.66]Jerma, please.
[118:22.66]Oh, alright.
[118:23.58]The Topps, when you actually complete Topps' quest line, he gives you, like, a... Right?
[118:29.43]Yeah, the barrier.
[118:30.75]Right.
[118:31.03]Yeah.
[118:32.11]And it's like a two-second, like... Okay, well, no, you've got to give us the reverb, Jerma.
[118:36.71]They're not getting the full experience.
[118:38.11]Come on, everybody...
[118:41.19]yeah wow it's like I'm playing the game yeah right what is the name of that sorcery do we know I believe it's tops is buried yeah oh it's his it's his barrier yeah he made it up and I don't think I ever got it to work once
[118:54.44]I've never even used it.
[118:57.08]Like most sorceries in Elden Ring, there's like nine.
[119:00.30]Yeah.
[119:01.01]There's not a hundred.
[119:02.55]There's like 10% of them are useful and the rest are just like, oh, that's cool.
[119:05.73]And then you put it in the backseat.
[119:08.55]Well, that was, thank you both of you.
[119:10.31]That was awesome.
[119:10.67]That was fantastic.
[119:11.23]Thank you for having us.
[119:12.23]Congratulations to you.

[124:43.72]Ready to play.
[124:44.62]Oh!
[124:44.68]Oh!
[124:44.76]Hey, we gotta get out of here, guys.
[124:45.66]I don't want to... Whoa!
[124:46.60]Whoa!
[124:46.72]Whoa!
[124:46.88]Whoa!
[125:09.88]Alright, everyone, thank you so much for joining us on the Assassin's Feast Mafia Dinner.
[125:15.42]Once again, I am your host and game master, Gina Darling, and thanks for joining us.
[125:20.31]I'm going to send you guys over to a break right now so you guys can go on a bathroom break, grab something to eat, and thank you for all... They're all gone.
[125:29.09]I'm all alone.
[125:31.13]Thanks to the guys for coming to play my game, and as always, take care, drink your water, and eat well.
[125:37.74]Bye.
[125:39.01]I'm gonna need help getting out of this.
[125:41.49]How much for Jerma to hit the Luddy?
[125:42.85]I think at least 400K, right?
[125:45.43]He's not cheap.
[125:46.81]405?
[125:46.91]405K, yeah, that's what he said.
[125:50.24]Actually, no, it's a 401K.
[125:51.58]That's why they call it that.
[125:53.00]Yeah, the 401Ks, because that's what it costs.
[125:54.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[125:55.64]He keeps saying, I have a 401K.
[125:56.96]And I'm like, that's not what it is.
[125:57.90]It's a, yeah.
[125:58.46]Hey, good luck with that.
[125:59.42]Good luck.
[126:00.18]Damn!
[126:00.86]Look at that luscious locks.
[126:02.02]Beautiful red hair.
[126:03.10]It's insane.
[126:05.10]I just want to call him Ian.
[126:07.56]Bam, I think it's a 25.
[126:09.04]And Eric, what is a Jarl?
[126:10.93]Jarl is like a head of the city.
[126:14.95]They're like the king, per se, of the area of Skyrim.
[126:19.81]But hey, I mean, Jerma's incredibly knowledgeable about what a Jarl is.
[126:22.65]Jerma!
[126:23.93]Yeah, we can talk about that for a little bit if we want to.
[126:25.65]Jerma, I would love for you, first off, Lil Mac Live donated $69.
[126:29.69]How does that make you feel, white boy?
[126:32.23]It's pretty good.
[126:37.34]I think that's pretty good.
[126:38.32]Damn, you really got it there.
[126:43.19]You are like, somehow you are so far away too.
[126:46.33]Like miles apart.
[126:48.37]Hey, what's up buddy?
[126:51.39]Hey pal, any speed bumps over there?
[126:56.39]Jermall, what is a yarrow?
[126:58.36]Okay.
[126:58.84]What's a Jarl?
[126:59.56]I looked at the schedule and I was very excited for Skyrim.
[127:04.91]And I said, okay, Jarl, killing Jarl in every town.
[127:09.37]I was like, oh, that sounds really, really cool.
[127:11.79]What a great idea.
[127:13.07]I thought it was a guy's name.
[127:15.49]I thought there was just like a bunch of Dave Jarl, like Joe Jarl, like a Hitman mission.
[127:21.35]It was just like a bunch of Jarls.
[127:22.75]There was a Jarl.
[127:23.46]It's like killing every Claire in the game.
[127:25.88]I thought it was a name.
[127:27.46]So I was like, wow, I can't believe there's that many people with that name.
[127:29.48]I thought the same thing.
[127:30.30]That sounds like a Doug Doug run.
[127:32.74]I killed every guy named Ben.
[127:34.72]Every guy named Ben.
[127:35.92]Doug would do that.
[127:37.05]I was like, that sounds pretty cool.
[127:38.43]And it's like, oh, wait, that's a title.
[127:40.55]Yeah, it's like going in Hitman and killing everybody with a yellow hat.
[127:44.51]That's a very Doug Doug thing to do.
[127:46.83]It is the mayor in Norse or Danish, the chief.
[127:49.99]Wait, what did you say, Doug?
[127:53.09]He was clarifying, I think, killing every Jarl with a yellow hat is what he said there.
[127:57.42]He's going to go fast.
[128:00.30]Is he going to go fast?
[128:01.38]He better.
[128:02.62]I can't wait to see some of the tricks in here.
[128:04.06]I hope I puke.
[128:06.58]From the speed?
[128:07.28]Yeah.
[128:09.41]I don't get a bucket, bro.
[128:11.19]For your case.
[128:12.49]Oh, dude, we should get some orange liquid.
[128:17.41]It'll be a great bit.
[128:19.71]It'll be wicked funny.
[128:22.27]Get chunks.
[128:23.97]From the limited knowledge I know about Skyrim speedruns, the game is absolutely broken wide open.
[128:28.79]Don't say.
[128:30.65]This has the game.
[128:32.33]No way.
[128:32.87]Crazy.
[128:33.53]That's nuts.
[128:34.83]From what I know, if Doug Doug streams, the game is broken.
[128:38.19]Oh, yeah.
[128:38.67]I mean, you get on a horse.
[128:40.09]You give this man a horse, he's across the map.
[128:42.51]You ride for a mile, give him a... What is it?
[128:45.42]That's it?
[128:46.34]You got it.
[128:47.50]If you get a horse, ride him for a mile.
[128:48.88]Guess my total play time in Skyrim.
[128:52.20]700.
[128:52.26]What?
[128:52.46]750 hours.
[128:52.72]250 hours.
[128:54.56]A couple playthroughs.
[128:58.95]I would guess, if I'm giving you an honest guess, I feel like you put in 347 hours.
[129:05.17]Okay.
[129:06.67]That's a really good guess.
[129:09.11]It was about one hour and 45 minutes.
[129:14.48]An hour and 45?
[129:14.96]Oh, man.
[129:17.12]Wait, hold up.
[129:17.52]Can we get Doug?
[129:17.88]I don't think we can hear you.
[129:18.64]Can we get Doug's mic?
[129:20.62]Hi, Tess.
[129:22.70]Oh, my God.
[129:23.72]Hi, James.
[129:25.26]That was so loud.
[129:26.10]Can I just quick test?
[129:28.49]How many total hours of Skyrim?
[129:30.21]20.
[129:31.41]Oh, you've played 20?
[129:33.51]Yeah.
[129:34.35]I started to play through.
[129:35.15]I've played like 30, but like probably 50 in 2016.
[129:37.69]Okay.
[129:37.81]Alright.
[129:38.01]Zero, Doug.
[129:38.25]I'm on for the ride.
[129:38.73]Okay.
[129:44.32]About two.
[129:45.40]Okay, yeah.
[129:46.54]So collectively, we have about a playthrough.
[129:48.50]No, no, no.
[129:49.78]You collectively have a quarter of a playthrough.
[129:52.21]You collectively have one or two quest lines in the game.
[129:54.85]Oh, this is great.
[129:55.71]Which is great, because you'll be impressed, and you won't know the stuff I'm... He's shouting at people.
[129:59.81]Why?
[130:01.82]No, we're not going to shout.
[130:02.54]That's not fast enough.
[130:03.40]This is where Doug does a casual playthrough, but he got a bunch of schmoes.
[130:06.64]So we're like, whoa, he can shoot fireballs.
[130:10.42]Wait, don't look keen shot.
[130:11.44]Is that something you came up with?
[130:12.50]Don't look out a skeleton, a skeleton.
[130:14.28]Cool.
[130:17.22]So you got everybody ready?
[130:19.84]Yeah.
[130:20.16]Oh, yeah.
[130:20.58]We're good to go.
[130:21.82]Oh, wait, hold on.
[130:22.32]I was going to tell my Discord to get on here.
[130:25.38]One second.
[130:25.72]This is like a movie.
[130:26.70]I can't wait to watch.
[130:28.30]I'm excited.
[130:28.88]I'm excited.
[130:29.40]I've never seen this game.
[130:31.53]Alright.
[130:32.33]Wait, why an hour and 45 minutes?
[130:34.39]No, it's just like 20 minutes.
[130:35.83]It's going to be world record.
[130:37.35]Yes, sir.
[130:38.17]Alright.
[130:38.41]Alright.
[130:38.95]Starting at 3, 2, 1, go.
[130:40.85]Oh, go.
[130:41.91]Let's go.
[130:42.45]A dragon.
[130:44.38]Wait, is it actually 20 minutes?
[130:48.25]Yeah, well, it depends.
[130:49.99]The horse... I have to pee.
[130:51.17]I have to pee.
[130:51.57]I have to pee.
[130:51.87]I have to pee.
[130:52.37]I'm not... You got time.
[130:53.23]You got it.
[130:53.53]You got it.
[130:54.03]Don't worry.
[130:54.33]Don't worry.
[130:54.65]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[130:55.41]He's speedrunning.
[130:55.85]He's speedrunning.
[130:56.23]You're that guy that goes to the movie and then gets up and pees when it starts.
[131:00.83]It's the preview.
[131:01.61]We know this scene.
[131:02.44]Everybody's seen this.
[131:03.56]Wait, I'm not... Oh, you know this scene?
[131:05.44]This is from the TikTok memes.
[131:08.20]Oh, okay.
[131:08.68]Okay.
[131:08.96]That makes sense.
[131:09.44]Makes sense.
[131:09.92]I did say that if anybody in chat can fully transcribe, like from memory knows every single line from the whole Skyrim intro, he'll donate $50,000 per person.
[131:18.41]He said that if they say it in chat or whatever, in a row, everybody, everyone has one.
[131:26.14]and if they all say it, then it's $50,000.
[131:28.56]No repeats, then it's $50,000.
[131:30.26]Exactly.
[131:30.72]Exactly.
[131:31.08]They got it.
[131:31.40]They got it.
[131:31.95]I probably should explain what's going on.
[131:32.87]Alright.
[131:33.15]So we're finally awake.
[131:34.37]This is The Elder Scrolls Skyrim.
[131:36.11]It's a brand new game.
[131:36.93]It just came out on Nintendo Switch, I think like two years ago.
[131:39.50]It's great.
[131:40.52]So this is the kill all yards speed run.
[131:45.17]He hates horse rides.
[131:46.53]He hates the carriage.
[131:48.21]I mean, you might get a little nauseous watching this, just this turbulence.
[131:52.11]So the Kill All Jarls speedrun, I know some people maybe don't think of me as like a hardcore speedrunner, but I actually had the world record in this category when I made it up a few years ago.
[132:02.44]And as far as I'm aware, I might still be the world record holder because I never checked if anybody else has beaten it.
[132:06.94]So as far as we're aware, world record holder here.
[132:10.16]The Kill All Jarls speedrun is you are going to all nine cities in the game
[132:15.44]and you're going to kill the leader of each one.
[132:17.32]Jarl is like an old term in like Scandinavia for like the chieftain or whatever of like some, you know, Viking village.
[132:23.55]So the Jarls are essentially the kings of Skyrim and we're going to go and kill all nine of them.
[132:27.89]That's when the speedrun ends.
[132:28.85]Once all nine of them are dead and there's a political vacuum in the world of Skyrim.
[132:32.73]Now, this is the way Skyrim is meant to be played, but it is literally not how you're supposed to play this game.
[132:38.08]You're not supposed to be able to kill any of these guys.
[132:40.22]But if you go into the game files and you change a setting, then you can kill them.
[132:44.02]So we're doing that, and then everybody is killable in the whole game, and then we'll just kind of see what happens.
[132:48.81]So we have a few minutes to kill before the gameplay starts.
[132:51.91]But for the people on the couch, there's three steps to how this speedrun works.
[132:56.69]Ooh.
[132:57.03]OK.
[132:57.49]I'm ready.
[132:58.24]So step one is we're going to go through this whole intro section, right?
[133:01.10]There's this whole tutorial area.
[133:02.94]You've got to escape from, spoiler alert, you escape being executed when a dragon shows up.
[133:07.60]And then you go through this little Helgen keep castle area.
[133:11.68]You go through tutorial dungeon.
[133:13.28]And then you get out into the open world.
[133:14.52]So step one.
[133:15.08]Dude, that's complete.
[133:16.08]We got to get out into the open world as fast as possible.
[133:19.85]That's step one.
[133:21.11]Step two is once we're in the open world, we got to get to one of the cities.
[133:24.45]And so we're going to go to the city at the very top of the map because it's funny and because there's some money there that we're going to take.
[133:28.93]So step two is we got to get from the bottom of the map all the way to the top as fast as we can.
[133:33.11]And then step three is once we're at the city, we just start blasting.
[133:36.64]We start killing everybody.
[133:37.88]And there's a carriage driver who can fast travel us to all the cities.
[133:41.38]So once we have the first one unlocked, we can go to the other nine and we just kill everybody as fast as possible.
[133:46.52]That's the plan.
[133:47.12]Three step process.
[133:48.32]This is step one.
[133:49.02]We got to get through the intro.
[133:50.47]Any questions?
[133:55.53]Yeah, that's good.
[133:56.77]That's good.
[133:57.09]Keep it up.
[133:58.75]You got this, man.
[134:01.33]Who's your favorite Jarl?
[134:03.74]It's a good Jarl.
[134:05.56]There's some good Jarls here.
[134:06.46]Actually, if you guys could, while we're doing this, make a live tier list and rank each one.
[134:10.54]Oh, 100%.
[134:11.48]Yeah, I like that a lot.
[134:13.32]Let's do it.
[134:13.72]There's no guns, right?
[134:15.59]You use spells.
[134:16.43]Spells are like guns of your, right?
[134:19.59]Yeah, spells are... Sometimes games like this will have, like, Sekiro had a gun.
[134:25.27]Yeah, I mean, like, the French Revolution was done through fireball spells, right?
[134:29.21]You know what I'm saying?
[134:31.05]My favorite spell is lightning.
[134:33.54]I'm a fireball guy.
[134:34.76]Oh, really?
[134:35.42]Yeah, I like fireball.
[134:36.98]Can I switch seats?
[134:41.25]So one thing to note before we get into the actual gameplay, the challenge of step one, which is escaping this intro area that we got to get out of, is that your hands are bound, right?
[134:50.02]You're like a prisoner, and so your hands are roped up, and you can't play the game.
[134:54.40]You can't use weapons or do anything with your hands bound.
[134:57.46]So it's not just about getting out of this castle.
[134:59.75]We also have to get the hands unbound.
[135:02.07]So there's a little bit of weirdness we're going to do with a multiverse to make that happen.
[135:06.25]But I'll explain it.
[135:07.09]It'll be fine.
[135:07.63]Is this like the Mario Watch for Rolling Rocks and Half an A Press, where we talk about parallel universes travel across Skyrim?
[135:15.08]Much more complex than that.
[135:16.96]Oh, really?
[135:17.38]Do we need a PhD for this?
[135:18.68]I didn't study.
[135:19.90]If you don't have one, get out.
[135:21.16]Get off my couch.
[135:21.84]Hey, it's been great, guys.
[135:22.70]We're safe.
[135:23.34]I only got a master's.
[135:24.30]My bad.
[135:25.29]Alright, so we're going to be a high elf.
[135:26.97]Whoa!
[135:28.29]What are you?
[135:30.03]Do you have something against high elves?
[135:31.29]Name?
[135:31.47]Do you have something against high elves?
[135:33.23]Jerma?
[135:33.57]Name?
[135:34.07]Coney?
[135:34.37]Name?
[135:37.45]Sloppy.
[135:39.32]Perfect.
[135:40.42]It's great.
[135:41.26]Now, the reason we're a high elf is because the way they decided how fast characters run in this game is how, just like real life, how tall you are.
[135:49.48]So it's literally if you're taller, then you run faster, and high elves are the tallest race, so that's why you play as a high elf.
[135:55.89]Big strides.
[135:57.07]Big strides.
[135:57.81]Yeah, that makes sense.
[135:58.77]Physics.
[135:59.27]Wait, so you can't kill any Jarls in the game proper?
[136:02.83]That's crazy.
[136:04.05]Normal Vanilla Skyrim, you cannot.
[136:05.95]Basically, there's a whole bunch of NPCs that are marked as essential, and that means they can't die.
[136:12.07]And the reason being, if they were to die, like these two guys right here, one of whom we'll kill later, the guy on the left.
[136:16.75]He's the final boss.
[136:17.73]There's Ulfric right there.
[136:18.95]So both of these guys, because they're critical to the storyline,
[136:22.32]can't die normally in the game because then you would break all the quest lines and the game would not be completable.
[136:27.34]But again, with this funny setting, then you can totally screw up the game and kill everybody.
[136:31.44]Yeah.
[136:31.74]So you're not, you're not supposed to do this.
[136:34.72]Yeah.
[136:35.04]We're six minutes in, you haven't pressed a button.
[136:38.20]I should say.
[136:39.06]This is a great, we're on log for the ride.
[136:40.66]This blew my mind in like 2008.
[136:41.92]This is the coolest game I've ever seen.
[136:44.54]So normally speedruns for Skyrim, they start in about a minute and a half when you get control of your character.
[136:50.19]Because this is just, you're just watching this.
[136:52.05]Right.
[136:52.81]I thought it'd be funny.
[136:53.41]I mean, I love this.
[136:57.71]It's a good cutscene.
[136:58.55]I mean, we're literally watching.
[136:59.71]It's a playthrough for us right now.
[137:00.99]The adventures of Sloppy.
[137:01.95]Hey, hey, hey, remember when he said, oh, you're awake?
[137:06.58]Oh, yeah.
[137:06.90]He did do that.
[137:07.68]The thing is, we got a $5 donation from number one Jarl hater saying, hey, you, you're finally awake.
[137:15.10]If you hate Jarls, this is the speedrun.
[137:16.98]I was going to kill that guy.
[137:18.24]All of the speedruns.
[137:19.10]First Jarl down.
[137:20.14]I didn't know that was going to be violent.
[137:21.22]First Jarl down.
[137:22.24]Oh, my God.
[137:23.02]There goes the Jarl.
[137:23.74]He's crazy.
[137:24.80]I didn't know this was going to be.
[137:25.95]Let's go.
[137:26.53]Jarl dead.
[137:27.05]Jarl is dead.
[137:28.61]I think this is going to be an R-rated movie.
[137:38.04]Honestly, I'd say D tier.
[137:42.93]Oh, no way.
[137:43.65]That's S. Really?
[137:44.75]Yeah.
[137:45.37]I feel it's a little underwhelming.
[137:48.67]That's underwhelming?
[137:50.59]I don't know.
[137:51.09]I have a sample size of one.
[137:53.46]It sets the tone.
[137:54.62]Hey, could you start over?
[137:55.50]I just got here.
[137:58.84]All righty.
[137:59.42]So the actual game is going to start in just a second.
[138:02.38]It's going to be real poggy.
[138:03.51]Sloppy?
[138:04.77]No.
[138:05.37]What?
[138:05.95]His name is Sloppy.
[138:06.95]His name is Sloppy.
[138:07.99]I should have been clear.
[138:09.35]Sloppy?
[138:10.27]No.
[138:12.42]I didn't come up with that.
[138:13.16]Guess who named him Sloppy.
[138:15.22]Oh, God.
[138:16.04]He's a high elf because he's taller and that makes him go faster.
[138:18.44]Okay.
[138:18.98]You guys have learned a lot while I've been gone.
[138:22.00]This is the opening tutorial.
[138:25.12]We did not need to watch this.
[138:27.04]Alright.
[138:27.93]So the actual real speedrun starts right now.
[138:31.79]So first I'm going to do a glitch to activate infinite sprint.
[138:34.69]So now I'm moving at sprint speed, but have infinite stamina.
[138:37.11]I'm going to talk quite a lot.
[138:38.29]We say hello to the dragon.
[138:39.05]Hello, dragon.
[138:39.55]We jump out this and then to the left.
[138:42.63]Now we're basically outside.
[138:46.03]Pass me that bucket.
[138:47.41]Please, please.
[138:47.95]Pass me that bucket.
[138:48.99]Pass me that bucket.
[138:49.59]Pass me that bucket.
[138:50.65]You got like three.
[138:52.29]That's a communal bucket.
[138:53.63]But wait, my hands are bound.
[138:54.99]I can't go out into the open world right there.
[138:56.45]Damn it.
[138:56.79]What are we going to do?
[138:57.68]Well, I know.
[138:57.98]We're going to drop down here and create another save file in this building with our boy Hadvar, OK?
[139:03.68]And so just like in real life, you can run into him, and he'll stop talking.
[139:08.98]That works on me too.
[139:09.60]That works on me too.
[139:10.20]That would work on me.
[139:10.92]That would work on me.
[139:11.56]We forked into two different save files.
[139:13.72]In this one, my hands are now unbound.
[139:15.94]I have hands.
[139:16.60]Yay.
[139:17.14]So I'm going to save this.
[139:18.90]Then I'm going to quick load back to where I was on the parapet up here and jump out.
[139:25.00]Sorry, what's a parapet?
[139:26.46]I thought you were going to punch that guy.
[139:29.79]That's not a Jarl.
[139:33.17]Are you allowed to kill anyone without a Jarl?
[139:35.93]No.
[139:36.57]That's morally questionable.
[139:37.63]That's up to you.
[139:39.16]For each person who I kill isn't a Jarl, Ludwig will donate $1,000.
[139:41.76]He said that.
[139:43.68]He said that.
[139:44.12]You heard it right here.
[139:44.94]So I'm out in the open world now.
[139:46.48]I'm going to go to this cave, which is a load zone.
[139:48.16]I'm going to go right to the edge of the cave.
[139:49.92]And we basically need a way to get the save file where my hands are unbound out here into the open world.
[139:55.33]because now he's trapped in the castle.
[139:56.35]So what I'm going to do is go into the load zone while opening the menu at the same time.
[140:00.85]So now we're midway through a load, but I interrupted it.
[140:03.05]And I'm actually playing the menu of Skyrim right now.
[140:05.76]You can't see it.
[140:06.52]So I'd go down six times, E, down, E, E. And what I'm going to do here is quit.
[140:11.69]And then I'm going to load this file, the file where my hands are unbound.
[140:15.93]And now the game completes the load.
[140:17.51]Now my hands are unbound in this cave.
[140:19.33]I go outside and around the open world.
[140:20.87]Cool.
[140:24.02]Let's beat some yarls.
[140:25.80]Will there be a quiz?
[140:28.42]I will.
[140:28.86]The quiz is...
[140:31.58]$2 to make DougDoug go bald.
[140:32.92]Yes, that does work.
[140:33.97]It only costs $2.
[140:34.73]Thank you.
[140:36.71]We reached the donation goal.
[140:38.57]Alright.
[140:39.09]So we're at the bottom of the map.
[140:40.13]We want to get up here to the capital city of Solitude.
[140:43.19]So to do that, we are going to do horse.
[140:46.68]You're literally not touching the controller right now.
[140:50.16]We're going to use a rocket ship.
[140:51.76]That's correct.
[140:52.20]Whoa.
[140:52.58]Rocket ship?
[140:54.33]So we need to get there really, really, really fast.
[140:56.53]We're going to be taking Skyrim Airlines.
[140:57.99]Damn, this guy is fast.
[140:59.17]You are kidding.
[140:59.89]I know.
[141:00.21]He's tall.
[141:00.61]What class is this?
[141:01.95]High elf.
[141:02.62]They're faster.
[141:03.40]The high elf.
[141:03.78]Their class is tall.
[141:06.54]So there's some bandits here.
[141:09.48]We're going to kind of run past them.
[141:11.34]Sloppy is scary.
[141:13.08]You're acting like there's a bear that you're trying to scare off.
[141:15.75]He's a clamber.
[141:16.47]A little goblin.
[141:20.16]Bears hate naked guys.
[141:21.02]Oh, that's indecent.
[141:22.25]Yeah, you do got to get big for them.
[141:23.41]It's true.
[141:23.79]I've heard that.
[141:24.11]So first thing you got to do with the rocket, you got to find a launch pad.
[141:27.29]So we're going to go, let's see, maybe here.
[141:31.43]We go to this spot.
[141:33.13]We look up against the, let me make sure I'm not, cool, look up against the wall.
[141:37.12]Imagine looking out your window and seeing this fucking guy doing this.
[141:39.92]so that's step one we found a launch pad uh now we gotta find the rocket so uh there's probably gonna be a rocket right about here right now yeah there he is cool so we're gonna go talk to this guy ever say that's a horse rocket please and he says yeah of course you asked politely that's cool with me that's so nice wow alright so we get on this over here and we're gonna build up a lot of speed with our rocket um because the rockets have a lot of problems in this game
[142:01.93]Dude, I'm telling you, don't get this guy a horse.
[142:03.49]The horse is the rocket?
[142:04.49]Horse named rocket, yeah.
[142:06.11]Oh, the horse is named rocket.
[142:07.64]My body is going to be the rocket.
[142:09.62]What's the upper stage in a rocket?
[142:11.40]What's that called?
[142:11.86]The boosters?
[142:12.78]And then the... Oh, no.
[142:14.72]This hurts the rocket.
[142:17.70]No, this is what rockets are meant to do.
[142:19.36]Now I get off of the horse, but because there's no place for my body to go, he starts whipping back and forth violently in midair.
[142:25.68]So you actually see I'm kind of like my ass is facing the camera.
[142:28.47]It's going to kind of... Nope.
[142:29.79]That's...
[142:30.71]Like that?
[142:31.27]That's probably too much.
[142:31.99]Okay, we're going to be going really fast on Skyrim Airlines.
[142:34.19]So I'm now going insanely, insanely fast.
[142:37.15]That wouldn't be a problem if you continue to stay on a horse.
[142:39.31]But if you go load the other file where I was standing up the mountain on the launch pad, it's going to give me all that speed.
[142:44.57]And now we're out of time.
[142:49.41]Oh, sloppy!
[142:49.69]You Rooty-tuned yourself.
[142:50.74]You died.
[142:51.42]I saw Daffy Duck do that once.
[142:53.82]The cartoon.
[142:54.70]One of the greatest actors of all time, by the way.
[142:56.24]The rocket ship is a little hard to control, so we might have to try it a few times.
[143:00.22]This is take two of the rocket.
[143:01.26]We're also going to need to do a crash landing of the rocket into water because otherwise all the passengers will die.
[143:06.57]They do this with real rockets.
[143:07.81]Oh, my God.
[143:08.29]Wait, that's probably enough.
[143:09.83]Yeah, you ever see the Falcon 9?
[143:11.51]Yeah, 100%.
[143:15.60]Okay.
[143:18.40]I hope he gets down safely.
[143:20.34]So the only way to stop is to stop all of your mentors like that.
[143:25.26]Oh, my legs.
[143:26.45]So unless you do that correctly and I did press the wrong button, yeah, it is going to be dangerous.
[143:30.63]He's got this clenched fist like, God damn it.
[143:33.77]That crab was so happy.
[143:35.33]Imagine being that crab.
[143:36.89]A free meal, you know, right in front of him.
[143:39.79]Doug, he's kind of speaking like an airline pilot on cocaine.
[143:43.73]Get your tray table up because we're about to go flying.
[143:47.80]Keep your arms, legs, feet inside the moving vehicle.
[143:50.58]Is that the sloppy?
[143:52.44]Sloppy, that's too fast.
[143:54.32]Sloppy, no.
[143:54.74]Alright, so we started here.
[143:56.82]See, I kind of went the wrong direction.
[143:58.14]We've got to get up here.
[143:59.00]Maybe we're fast enough.
[143:59.86]13,000 feet.
[144:00.34]And alright, so.
[144:05.63]Nope.
[144:05.97]Nope.
[144:06.19]Need to go a little bit more like that.
[144:07.85]So come on sloppy challenge here.
[144:10.13]Oh, oh, oh, the humanity.
[144:12.89]Oh my God.
[144:14.64]Like with any airplane, you need a lot of speed to fly.
[144:18.14]But the problem, I think the girls are going to be safe.
[144:21.05]This is just Spirit Airlines.
[144:23.75]It's like there's no, if you go too fast, you'll die.
[144:27.31]Like you'll just go out of the world and die.
[144:29.15]And so that's kind of a problem.
[144:30.07]You got to be like real fast, but not too fast, you know?
[144:33.01]And then again, no real landing system other than just everybody jumps out of the plane.
[144:37.49]This poor woman is horrified.
[144:39.97]I mean, candidly, you're still flying better than Twitch chat.
[144:43.34]yeah so that's good that's good that's pretty good what's wrong with you that's not how you ride a horse that horse was so sassy 200 from Rosa make doug bald doug what's the don't know gopher bald he said a thousand
[145:06.39]Actually, remember, it's $2 is what I said.
[145:08.33]Oh, right, $2.
[145:09.13]Oh, thank you, Alex, for the $2.
[145:10.65]Alright, here we go.
[145:11.55]Alright, so that's the capital city right here.
[145:16.47]Oop, overshot it a little bit.
[145:17.84]And now we're here at Solitude.
[145:19.76]So that's step two done.
[145:21.72]Yay!
[145:22.22]Nice.
[145:22.90]Is this one of those games that doesn't have fall damage if you fall in water?
[145:25.64]Correct.
[145:26.26]It's safe to land a plane directly into the water, yes.
[145:28.80]Oh, that makes sense.
[145:29.86]But in the real world, we also land rockets in water.
[145:33.24]And that's why they do it, because there's no fall damage if you land in water.
[145:36.94]Yeah.
[145:38.18]At all, actually.
[145:39.62]All righty.
[145:40.28]So now that we've successfully landed the plane, we are almost ready for step three, which is to start blasting.
[145:46.53]We do need money, though, because we're going to buy a carriage ride to all the different nine cities and then start killing everybody, right?
[145:53.93]So the question is, oh, shoot, where are we going to find money?
[145:55.97]I don't have money.
[145:56.57]I'm just like some naked guy running around.
[145:58.97]But fortunately, there's a cool thing you can do called stealing.
[146:01.67]Whoa.
[146:02.91]Explain it.
[146:03.44]These cat merchants are usually sitting up here.
[146:05.82]Hopefully, they aren't sitting here right now.
[146:07.86]So they're sitting up here, and they sell you stuff.
[146:10.02]But the way the game actually works is that they don't hold items on themselves.
[146:12.88]There's actually like a chest just underground.
[146:17.18]just kind of floating down there.
[146:18.88]Oh, my God.
[146:19.47]And that's where the game actually stores the items.
[146:21.41]And unfortunately, the cats... Ooh!
[146:23.63]Little mistake.
[146:24.39]They put them a little bit too close, and if I sneak close to the ground and just kind of look around here... He's making this up, right?
[146:30.71]Oh, there's a chest.
[146:31.28]So now I can look into their chest and just take all their stuff.
[146:34.98]My stuff!
[146:36.24]What's really important here is they have so much money.
[146:38.54]We're taking all that.
[146:39.22]We need that.
[146:40.34]Honestly, like...
[146:41.85]Like, you guys want anything?
[146:42.71]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[146:43.27]Take those gems.
[146:44.39]Yeah, could I have a potion of Cure Disease, please?
[146:46.11]Can I have a Petit Soul Gem?
[146:48.21]Anybody want a Tusk?
[146:49.13]Take that fucking beer.
[146:50.21]Do not grab the Tusk.
[146:51.41]Do not grab the Tusk.
[146:52.93]I'll be... Here, hold on.
[146:53.67]Take the beer.
[146:54.57]Put the Tusk back.
[146:55.75]There you go.
[146:56.99]Do they have cheese?
[146:58.51]Oh, I do actually want some.
[146:59.41]Okay, I do need actual potions.
[147:01.01]This is decent RNG here.
[147:02.87]One salt pile.
[147:04.25]And if you're wondering if this is important, yeah, this is...
[147:06.49]Definitely.
[147:07.03]Any cheese for it?
[147:08.03]Yeah, alright, cool.
[147:09.15]So we stole a bunch of money from these cats.
[147:11.42]We're doing well.
[147:13.08]And now we start killing.
[147:15.16]$10 from Jarl, you will never kill me.
[147:18.82]Funny you say that.
[147:19.64]So the first Jarl we're going to be going to is Jarl Elisif is, I believe, her name.
[147:24.52]She is the queen of Skyrim.
[147:26.02]We're starting off strong.
[147:28.51]You feel big pushing her around?
[147:30.05]A beautiful city.
[147:31.31]You look angry.
[147:34.07]Somebody's got to stop that guy.
[147:37.50]Don't they say, stop?
[147:38.93]Citizen.
[147:39.49]You violated the law.
[147:40.61]Citizen, you violated.
[147:42.03]You have to violate the law first.
[147:43.83]He hasn't violated the law yet.
[147:45.13]So he violates it when, oh, but then you'll never get it because he kills them violating the law.
[147:49.36]So then, damn.
[147:50.63]is arrow for my knee from this game yes that's that's this meme yeah it's very funny it still cracks me up yeah it's a good one it's a hoot alright so first yarrow what we're gonna do this is the queen we come up here we go to magic we're not in front of everyone
[148:19.67]You guys want anything?
[148:20.33]Do you have any cheese?
[148:21.37]I got a wine.
[148:23.11]Give me that wine.
[148:25.89]Okay, so we did kill the queen of Skyrim, but we can't go.
[148:29.73]I'm really sorry, man.
[148:30.65]There it is.
[148:34.37]I'm sorry.
[148:36.06]If you kill a guy, you just have to spend like 24 hours sleeping on the floor in jail and then you're scot-free and you're forgiven.
[148:43.68]And to be fair, they said by order the yarrow.
[148:47.38]What yarrow?
[148:50.04]There's no laws if there isn't a politician around.
[148:53.45]Where did you guys write that on the tier list?
[148:56.07]How many Jarls are in the game?
[148:58.31]There's nine total.
[148:59.41]That's one out of nine.
[149:01.43]Jarl Elsif donated... I think this is an old one.
[149:05.14]Oh, they gave me clothes in jail.
[149:06.44]That's nice.
[149:06.76]I'm putting that Jarl in an A. The fists.
[149:10.44]Came back out.
[149:11.20]She was a warrior queen.
[149:12.44]Warrior queen.
[149:13.80]I'd agree with that assessment.
[149:14.86]Many Queens would just sit back and let the guards do it.
[149:17.48]Yeah, she was all up in his face.
[149:19.39]Right.
[149:20.02]Because E-Trader donated $1, and what the hell?
[149:21.92]A queen of action.
[149:22.58]A queen of action.
[149:23.90]Alright, we've got another Jarl.
[149:24.80]Jarl's scald.
[149:25.48]He's a good one.
[149:26.00]Oh my god, that was so fast.
[149:27.34]Whoa, hey.
[149:27.96]Oh, whoa.
[149:28.24]That guy's got a sword.
[149:29.30]Yeah, but he's not putting up his fist.
[149:30.45]I do want to do this kind of in bursts, because up there.
[149:32.43]Alright, let's just get it.
[149:33.79]I do need the money, by the way, because we're going to do a little side quest.
[149:36.25]You guys want anything?
[149:36.91]Ooh, silver necklace.
[149:37.53]They booed that.
[149:38.15]They loved that.
[149:40.09]They did not like that.
[149:41.44]That was a D, Jarl.
[149:42.64]I'm sorry.
[149:43.58]Yeah, we love you get to go to jail again.
[149:45.52]Oh, they said to not boo.
[149:46.98]Oh, it's like, oh, yeah, that's great.
[149:50.48]Hey, honestly, dear to your Earl, you know, that wasn't a great year.
[149:53.38]I'll know.
[149:53.80]Yeah, not one of the favorites.
[149:54.86]Alright.
[149:55.08]Well, OK, well, let me let me show you another one for your consideration.
[149:57.98]Let's go over to let's go to Dawnstar next year to donated two dollars that you'll pay.
[150:03.78]Well, he got the money.
[150:06.03]Is this like your getaway driver?
[150:07.65]Does he just take you from town to town?
[150:09.09]This guy, I'm going to keep walking up to him and be like, hey, you know where you dropped me off before?
[150:14.25]The leader's dead.
[150:15.47]I need a ride to Palm Creek now.
[150:17.53]And he's just at no point is he going to pick up.
[150:19.33]And at what point are you guilty?
[150:21.17]Have you seen the movie Collateral?
[150:22.65]It's a lot like that.
[150:23.36]You're complicit after the third year old.
[150:26.18]Good thing that's not going to happen.
[150:27.66]There's no way that would happen.
[150:29.46]At some point, the driver turns and is just like, I want a jewel from the next tiara.
[150:34.14]Alright.
[150:35.38]No way he kills.
[150:36.24]Oh, that's crazy.
[150:37.78]Oh, my God.
[150:39.71]Where's his card?
[150:41.31]Wow.
[150:41.41]He had no help.
[150:42.35]He's got fish.
[150:43.47]Give me that necklace.
[150:44.35]Give me that necklace.
[150:45.77]Thank you.
[150:46.31]I'm sorry.
[150:46.81]I was like reading a book.
[150:49.07]Sorry about that.
[150:49.71]It's okay.
[150:50.13]Bro, my bad.
[150:50.60]$25.
[150:50.62]Happy birthday, Rosa.
[150:53.95]Okay, that's not correct.
[150:55.43]Hey, man.
[150:56.11]Hey, Judge.
[150:56.49]It was just a bit.
[150:57.25]No worries about it.
[150:58.71]It was a prank.
[150:59.31]Yeah.
[150:59.87]It was mad funny, though.
[151:01.43]Mad funny.
[151:02.77]Only 24 hours?
[151:03.67]No way he kills every Yarl.
[151:05.25]Hey, carriage driver.
[151:06.33]That's crazy.
[151:07.80]Somebody's dead over there.
[151:09.86]I got to get to Markarth, man.
[151:13.22]Remind me to make sure I take all the money off everybody because we do need it.
[151:16.02]If I forget to rob anybody, if you guys could help.
[151:19.36]For some reason, I just feel like you won't forget that.
[151:22.83]Sometimes it's the thrill of being able to take their jewels.
[151:26.20]A monster!
[151:26.94]What was that?
[151:27.64]A monster!
[151:28.38]I think it was cool.
[151:29.08]I hope that's not a Jarl.
[151:31.38]That'll kill you.
[151:32.28]I don't know.
[151:34.95]Scary.
[151:35.43]Unless Ludwig modded this without telling me, we should be okay.
[151:39.86]And again, if you're seeing these little like loads that I'm doing while running, that's to activate infinite sprint glitch.
[151:45.14]So that's why I'm able to just, this is, it doesn't look like it, but I'm moving at full sprint speed right now.
[151:49.62]No, it looks like you're going really fast.
[151:52.68]No, you're, you're going.
[151:53.92]Oh no.
[151:54.34]Whoa.
[151:54.66]Not this guy again.
[151:56.14]I'm sorry.
[151:56.78]Now this guy's, this guy can be tough.
[151:58.98]This guy can be a little tough.
[152:00.74]If there was a naked guy running around with flaming hands, running to the throne room, I think somebody probably would have tried to stop him.
[152:06.45]He's sprinting.
[152:11.92]Oh, no.
[152:12.94]Oh, he's having trouble.
[152:13.66]Okay.
[152:13.93]Hey, could you pick up an air with this for me?
[152:17.15]Thanks, man.
[152:17.67]Thanks.
[152:18.11]Ale, please.
[152:18.99]One ale, shall we?
[152:20.01]Alright.
[152:20.51]I might die here because they're attacking me.
[152:23.14]No, we're good.
[152:23.82]We're good.
[152:24.36]Just say sorry.
[152:25.00]Just say sorry.
[152:25.46]In this case, if I go to jail, I have to do this really long quest line.
[152:27.94]Don't want to do that.
[152:28.48]40 gold?
[152:30.24]Only $40 to kill.
[152:30.78]How much did you steal off him?
[152:32.77]Oh, they don't even mind.
[152:34.97]That's great.
[152:35.97]You stole more than 40 gold from him.
[152:38.91]It's net profit.
[152:39.67]They're basically asking for a cut.
[152:41.35]Hey, capitalism, alright?
[152:42.59]You know, fees just to cost a different business.
[152:44.33]That's just a revolution.
[152:45.43]They hated that fucking guy.
[152:46.63]They had to.
[152:47.79]Who's going to tell him?
[152:48.99]This dude is just chilling in the carriage.
[152:51.35]Guys, there's no way.
[152:53.55]He's sitting like us.
[152:54.90]There's no way he kills another girl.
[152:57.02]He's sitting like we are.
[152:58.18]This is pretty comfortable.
[153:01.34]You bring me some ale?
[153:02.34]Alright, so town people over here having a little powwow.
[153:06.24]Fortunately, the Jarl chose to go take a nap, I believe, and that is not a good sign.
[153:11.46]Oh, he didn't even close it.
[153:14.87]He didn't even close it.
[153:15.77]She wasn't even prepared.
[153:16.91]Where's the shame?
[153:17.97]Come on.
[153:20.21]Boo!
[153:21.09]Get the cheese.
[153:22.91]Cheese!
[153:23.13]Cheese!
[153:23.37]Can I make a special request?
[153:24.57]Can somebody arrest me?
[153:25.49]Okay, here we go.
[153:26.43]To kill the next Jarl with a brick.
[153:28.17]Yeah, can we request...
[153:31.08]We want you to kill the yarrow with physical blunt force trauma.
[153:34.72]Can you 360 it?
[153:35.66]Can you pop a 360?
[153:36.82]Oh, yo, that'd be sick.
[153:37.96]I want to see a 360 brick kill.
[153:38.82]It will be very hard, but I will try.
[153:41.19]Thank you.
[153:41.77]Oh, hell yeah.
[153:42.69]I want to see some Red Bull on that.
[153:43.85]Oh, a cat.
[153:44.79]Yarrow number six donated and said there's no way he can do it with blunt force.
[153:48.11]No way.
[153:48.67]He's not good enough.
[153:50.83]Alright.
[153:51.31]It is actually going to get harder.
[153:52.37]I'm going to say blunt force for one of the easier ones, because next up, we're going to go to Riften.
[153:57.02]And what we're going to do is we're going to get an ally to help us out here.
[154:00.28]And this actually doubles as a tutorial for how to find true love for Twitch chat.
[154:05.38]Whoa.
[154:07.50]OK.
[154:07.93]Riften on my rim till I yarrow.
[154:09.23]Sorry.
[154:09.57]Sorry.
[154:09.85]Had to get that out.
[154:10.75]Nice.
[154:11.31]Jesus Christ.
[154:13.39]How many Jarls are in this?
[154:14.21]Four, right?
[154:14.93]I believe it's five, no?
[154:17.13]I think this is five, but I don't remember.
[154:20.23]Now, was there ever a congregation of the Jarls to make it faster?
[154:23.91]Guys, we've had a lot of us disappear lately.
[154:25.77]We should come together and figure this out.
[154:28.89]Something's happening here.
[154:29.61]Should we meet up for protection?
[154:31.93]Alright, here's how to find true love.
[154:33.25]First off, you enter the tavern.
[154:34.33]You do need a little more money.
[154:35.27]Marriages are expensive.
[154:36.00]You go to this vendor, and you say, hey, what have you got for sale?
[154:39.10]Now, you take your own item, drag over a whole lady, and now you can sell her stuff back to her.
[154:44.90]So you can see at the bottom right, I'm selling her her own wine, and then I'm taking her money.
[154:48.84]So now we've got like $800.
[154:49.34]This is great.
[154:50.54]What?
[154:51.66]How did you?
[154:52.20]How does that work?
[154:53.36]How dare you?
[154:54.20]It's a yarrow.
[154:55.28]Kill him.
[154:57.16]You talk to the priest and you say, hey, do you have a temple?
[154:59.26]Can I get married?
[155:00.06]He's like, of course you can get married.
[155:01.46]All you have to do is buy a necklace.
[155:03.94]If you buy that, then you can get married really quick.
[155:05.68]So I'm like, okay, cool.
[155:06.52]I will take a necklace, please, for $200.
[155:08.28]That's a lot.
[155:09.50]Wow.
[155:09.68]Geez.
[155:10.28]Hey, he really cares about this girl.
[155:11.89]I've never met him.
[155:12.59]Hold on.
[155:14.70]I put on the necklace.
[155:15.34]Give him a kiss.
[155:15.94]I never met him.
[155:16.38]I said, hey, you work for me now.
[155:18.75]And he says, okay, sure.
[155:19.39]And then I say, hey, do you want to get married?
[155:20.85]He's like, yeah, I want to get married.
[155:22.35]Oh, hell yeah.
[155:23.21]This is like an HR violation.
[155:24.74]What's going on here?
[155:25.48]I go back to the priest.
[155:26.10]I'm like, yeah, we're ready to get married right now.
[155:27.56]He says, okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
[155:31.17]You run out here.
[155:32.23]Final stage is important.
[155:33.52]Life was simpler back then.
[155:35.60]This happens at pubs today.
[155:38.34]Vegas, even.
[155:39.20]Yeah.
[155:39.58]This is an arranged marriage, yeah.
[155:41.06]You go to the wedding temple, and you stand outside of it in the rain by yourself for 24 straight hours.
[155:46.55]Oh.
[155:46.97]It's a pagan ritual.
[155:48.15]I mean, that's why I was doing it.
[155:49.29]And you walk in, yeah.
[155:50.87]I really hope he was standing like this.
[155:52.81]That's on his side.
[155:56.93]That's on his side.
[155:59.29]Yeah.
[155:59.39]That's the best man.
[156:02.85]That's the best man.
[156:04.01]Now, normally in wedding, slow way to have a wedding, you actually listen to everything.
[156:07.51]But if you save and then load really quick, you cut him off mid-sentence.
[156:11.33]And so you don't even have to listen to the wedding ceremony.
[156:13.24]You can just get to the good stuff.
[156:14.78]Give him a kiss.
[156:15.92]I think this is not a typical Skyrim run.
[156:19.18]No, no.
[156:19.70]This is vanilla.
[156:20.82]So now I talk to my new husband.
[156:22.62]Hey.
[156:24.18]Congratulations.
[156:25.22]Happy Pride Month.
[156:26.62]Hey, I would love to live with you.
[156:28.26]And then I say, I need your help.
[156:30.74]Is that a URL?
[156:31.60]What is this?
[156:32.60]What is this?
[156:34.44]I feel like you guys aren't focusing on the run.
[156:35.90]So there is a Jarl here in Ripton, and now my husband, Mercurio, is going to follow me around and help kill people with me.
[156:42.75]Whoa!
[156:44.09]That's what they're for.
[156:44.85]If he dies, does he die forever in real life?
[156:46.97]That is the problem.
[156:47.95]Normally, no.
[156:48.61]But I do have the thing changed where everybody can die.
[156:51.11]So yeah, if he dies, I no longer have a husband.
[156:53.13]We'll see if he makes it through the run.
[156:54.85]And if we don't donate enough money, then I'm not sure he dies.
[156:57.97]Alright, so let's try to kill this.
[156:59.65]Oh, on the table.
[157:00.39]I like the flair.
[157:01.25]I like the flair.
[157:02.69]And she is dead.
[157:03.77]Let's go ahead and just chuck this out.
[157:06.33]Ooh, Garnet.
[157:07.47]Ooh, more money.
[157:08.13]Lockpick.
[157:08.83]Alright, not bad.
[157:09.77]And I'm really sorry, you guys.
[157:10.63]What did everybody just scream?
[157:11.95]Yarrow.
[157:12.67]Oh, I thought you all went, Yarrow.
[157:14.59]Like a pirate.
[157:16.57]I was like, these are Vikings.
[157:18.11]Wandering the booty.
[157:19.11]I can't hear that one.
[157:20.90]One dollar donation.
[157:21.64]Kill the husband.
[157:22.82]Whoa.
[157:24.76]I, for one, think that's wrong.
[157:26.71]I'll leave it up to the final y'all.
[157:28.74]Can we get a $2 donation to kill the husband?
[157:31.30]No, to save.
[157:32.24]Oh, to save the husband.
[157:33.02]Save or kill the animals, whatever.
[157:34.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[157:35.30]Yeah, yeah.
[157:36.32]Oh, they'll die or not.
[157:37.00]Whoever gives the highest single dono.
[157:38.42]We have three more.
[157:40.37]So let's kick off over to Whiterun.
[157:42.75]My carriage is the safest way to travel.
[157:48.63]I feel worse for your husband who has to follow you around doing this sprinting.
[157:52.53]He's definitely an accomplice, probably more so than the carriage driver, right?
[157:55.79]That guy is way more complicit.
[157:57.12]Yeah.
[157:59.61]What's cool, too, is, like, when I start killing people, he'll just start blasting.
[158:02.65]Sometimes it's the right person.
[158:03.69]Sometimes it'll kill innocents.
[158:04.77]Like, there's really no way of knowing.
[158:05.75]But, like, at least he gots your back, you know?
[158:07.03]That's true love.
[158:07.47]Like, he's there for you.
[158:08.73]Kind of.
[158:09.55]Like, he just sort of fires.
[158:11.53]Alright.
[158:12.19]So what I'm going to do is get a... It's not Jarl.
[158:14.24]I'm sorry, man.
[158:15.30]I'm going to get a free trip to the jail, because that's one of the cool things you can do if you commit a crime, the police give you a free ride.
[158:22.60]Oh, there's a dead guy.
[158:23.92]Take some money off him.
[158:24.74]Honestly.
[158:25.90]At this point, I feel like there'd be more pictures of you at wanted posters than there were stop signs in the world.
[158:32.58]Punch out for this fucking guy.
[158:33.60]Just littered everywhere.
[158:34.98]It was cool as the jail is right next to where the Yarrow is.
[158:38.47]Oh my god!
[158:39.07]Not again!
[158:40.61]What's the meaning of this interruption?
[158:41.57]I'm like, hold on, I gotta talk to the Yarrow.
[158:43.09]This guy can actually be kind of hard.
[158:47.50]He's taking a lot of damage, so he might be in trouble.
[158:50.72]Save Mercurial.
[158:51.86]Ooh, Garnet, love this.
[158:54.60]Okay, and we're going to put away...
[158:56.66]The husband's still alive.
[158:57.80]Husband's alive.
[158:58.24]Husband's alive.
[158:59.06]I think you may have burnt him.
[159:01.00]Thank God he's alive because we got $15 to save him from faux veil.
[159:04.61]Okay.
[159:05.53]Thank you.
[159:06.27]Don't tell my husband about this.
[159:09.41]I'm sorry.
[159:09.77]What were you doing?
[159:10.33]He gets a little lonely in the jail.
[159:11.93]It's cold.
[159:12.63]It's cold in there.
[159:13.53]Hey, no judgment.
[159:14.39]No judgment.
[159:15.13]Oh, wow.
[159:16.09]Alright.
[159:16.53]Two more.
[159:18.07]They shouldn't have ever gotten married.
[159:20.17]I've been saying that.
[159:21.85]It was a rocky marriage, man.
[159:23.32]You know, not good foundation.
[159:25.62]You can't build something on that.
[159:27.64]Need a ride?
[159:28.34]This guy should be impressed.
[159:30.64]It's your boy.
[159:31.54]Alright, Windhelm is going to be last.
[159:34.68]That's where Jarl Ulfric is, the man we met at the very beginning.
[159:37.58]Who are you going to kill with Blunt Force Trauma?
[159:39.22]This guy, we're going to do Blunt Force Trauma.
[159:40.76]Oh, okay.
[159:41.28]He's one of the smaller towns.
[159:42.81]He has a little bit less of a retinue with him, so we're just going to go ahead and beat the shit out of him.
[159:48.33]Mm-hmm.
[159:49.78]I haven't done this, so I don't know if this is hard or... Wait, you've never done this?
[159:54.84]Oh, he's doing it!
[159:55.32]He's doing it!
[159:56.20]He's doing it!
[159:56.68]Get him up!
[160:15.85]He was too strong.
[160:16.67]Wait, is Mercurio alive again?
[160:18.01]Yay!
[160:20.06]We gotta get a fisticuffs battle while keeping our husband alive.
[160:22.76]Alright.
[160:23.26]Or is the current top donor to kill him?
[160:24.70]Hey, give him the people's elbow.
[160:25.78]Give him the people's elbow.
[160:26.70]We got a $100 donation.
[160:28.28]Oh, nice.
[160:29.98]You got a $100 donation?
[160:31.20]Yeah, but they didn't want to kill him.
[160:32.70]Oh, my God.
[160:33.58]Wow, that was so fast.
[160:35.53]Oh.
[160:38.27]Oh, the kid!
[160:39.29]Oh my God!
[160:40.67]What is happening?
[160:41.79]I thought he was going for the kid.
[160:43.46]I thought he was going for the kid.
[160:46.20]I was like, holy shit.
[160:48.12]That kid is someone having a punch.
[160:51.48]Bro, he did turn.
[160:52.78]He did turn to that kid.
[160:54.12]It was a baseball swing.
[160:55.94]Oh my God.
[160:56.90]That kid was like, I'm not fucking with this.
[160:58.84]Alright, there you go.
[161:00.67]Yarl's down.
[161:01.31]Yarl's down.
[161:01.77]Yarl's down.
[161:02.27]Can I get arrested before my husband dies?
[161:04.74]He ran away.
[161:05.06]Alright.
[161:05.91]We got to go tell the police.
[161:07.49]Oh, my God.
[161:08.07]We go sleep in this jail.
[161:09.31]One more year.
[161:10.19]It's time at last year.
[161:11.57]The last year is dead.
[161:12.35]The time ends.
[161:31.52]I thought the kid did it.
[161:33.16]Dude, he turned on that kid.
[161:34.84]Hey.
[161:36.02]One more ride.
[161:37.59]Oh, my god.
[161:39.27]One last ride.
[161:40.13]One last job.
[161:41.11]Oh, my god.
[161:41.49]To Windhelm.
[161:42.15]One last job.
[161:42.53]One last job.
[161:43.41]I only played this game for two hours, and it's the best game ever made.
[161:47.50]Todd was right.
[161:48.26]Todd was right.
[161:53.82]In my 50 hours, I didn't do this.
[161:55.67]I was wasting time.
[161:56.57]How many yells did you kill?
[161:57.97]I think maybe one.
[162:00.71]Maybe none.
[162:02.13]I'm sorry, man.
[162:03.15]So now he'll get a free ride over to the jail.
[162:05.60]Not before he takes a swipe at you.
[162:07.70]That's on the house.
[162:08.38]A little feisty.
[162:11.18]And I do... Do I need to fit... Is this... Is this bare fists?
[162:15.50]Is the ending bare fists?
[162:16.42]Oh, dealer's choice, right, guys?
[162:17.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[162:18.95]Can you pop a 360 for me?
[162:20.63]No matter what you do.
[162:21.51]Do you need to do a 360?
[162:22.33]I need a 360.
[162:22.77]Okay, we're going to do an attempt with bare fists.
[162:25.29]If someone could do like a... I do have my husband with me, that will help.
[162:27.90]Can you throw plates and steaks and shit at him?
[162:30.08]Here we go.
[162:30.52]Here we go.
[162:31.02]Let's do it.
[162:31.70]Let's do it.
[162:32.90]Okay.
[162:33.12]Put that on his head.
[162:33.88]Get him.
[162:34.30]Get him.
[162:34.66]Get him.
[162:34.86]Get him with the butt kick.
[162:35.75]Yeah.
[162:35.87]360.
[162:35.89]360. 360.
[162:43.45]Oh shit!
[162:44.49]Oh my god!
[162:45.75]Killing all but one girl!
[162:47.41]That was crazy!
[162:48.29]Maybe we don't kill every girl!
[162:50.27]Oh my god!
[162:50.87]Maybe that girl's good!
[162:52.08]That girl's okay!
[162:53.96]Jesus!
[162:54.80]That girl's strong!
[162:56.20]Oh my god!
[162:56.86]Oh my god!
[162:57.66]That girl's strong!
[162:59.80]That's a very strong girl!
[163:01.80]Timing over here, because we do have the guy.
[163:03.81]Oh, no.
[163:05.41]He took it in the thigh.
[163:07.15]It's in the thigh.
[163:08.25]It's a little high.
[163:09.31]It's very tall.
[163:10.17]It's very tall.
[163:11.48]We're going to swatch over back to fire because this guy is actually hard.
[163:15.80]We're going to stand on the table.
[163:17.64]Give him the bunk cake.
[163:18.66]Give him the bunk cake.
[163:20.45]Get over here.
[163:21.01]Yeah.
[163:22.11]Oh, he's mad as hell.
[163:22.79]Oh, he's mad as hell.
[163:24.29]Oh, it's on time.
[163:26.37]Oh, yeah.
[163:28.85]Have a seat.
[163:29.65]Have a seat.
[163:30.27]Have a goddamn seat.
[163:31.84]You've earned it.
[163:32.90]And that counts.
[163:33.54]That counts.
[163:34.42]That's it.
[163:34.82]Yeah.
[163:35.08]That's the one and only way to play this game.
[163:40.16]That was crazy.
[163:41.20]All y'all's down.
[163:42.86]What's final...
[163:44.51]What's final verdict?
[163:46.15]32-43.
[163:46.51]And as far as rating, I don't know, Jerma, did you have a... No, no, I mean, do they kill or keep the husband?
[163:52.31]Oh, as far as... Well, they wanted to save the husband.
[163:56.03]Save the husband.
[164:00.09]Save the husband.
[164:02.73]Give him a kiss.
[164:05.71]Love wins.
[164:06.55]Love wins.
[164:08.36]Oh, my God, what happened?
[164:09.32]Okay, I was going to try to move the camera in.
[164:19.87]Actually guys if you could give us some I think I saw Sonic the Hedgehog Almost positive it was a lookalike Can you do the move?
[164:24.85]the
[164:41.34]You have to get a lot farther in the game and not kill everybody.
[164:44.20]Some of the guys that I kill are necessary to be able to do that.
[164:48.45]So not a lot else can happen in this particular save file of Skyrim.
[164:53.35]Could you beat the game?
[164:54.59]No.
[164:58.33]Absolutely not.
[164:59.37]No.
[164:59.81]That's why they're supposed to be unkillable.
[165:01.63]The game is very, very borked now.
[165:03.65]Yeah.
[165:04.54]Well, you got $100 from David Cockerings who loved that.
[165:07.90]Oh!
[165:08.28]Oh, yeah, David Cockerings.
[165:09.90]David C. I love that guy.
[165:11.80]We know DC.
[165:12.42]We know DC.
[165:13.06]David, of course, DC.
[165:14.96]Yeah, hope the Skyrim community, some proud.
[165:18.68]Yeah, it's honestly a really fun game to speedrun, even though it's a total disastrous mess, but it's great.
[165:23.72]So, very fun.
[165:24.76]There are Kendricks in chat.
[165:26.00]One more round of applause for Don.
[165:27.78]Great run.
[165:28.76]A great run.
[165:29.52]That was hilarious.
[165:30.24]That was awesome.
[165:30.96]That was great.
[165:31.52]That was lovely.
[165:32.38]That was succinct.
[165:34.12]It was basically like 24 minutes.
[165:36.38]And again, didn't need to watch the intro.
[165:40.79]It was a beautiful intro, though.
[165:43.03]I saw it for the first time.
[165:44.57]I mean, it was nice.
[165:45.63]I mean, I knew the meme intro or whatever, but I saw it on TikTok.
[165:50.15]And Chad, if you guys donate $2 right now, DougDoug will go bald.
[165:55.51]You need to do a $2 hype trade.
[165:56.47]That's true.
[165:56.93]It's true.
[166:00.07]He said he said it ran out the time right now.
[166:03.36]Oh, but three dollars, three dollars.
[166:05.18]He went and action.
[166:07.04]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[166:09.00]One more round.
[166:12.98]That was awesome.
[166:13.82]That was good.
[166:14.32]What a great speed.
[166:15.18]Good run.
[166:15.50]Oh, that was great.
[166:16.50]That was great.
[166:17.70]And we still got a few great speed runs coming up.
[166:20.32]What do we have coming up?
[166:21.00]Let's take a look at her coming up next.
[166:22.20]We got Lumi Laura playing Spyro the Dragon.
[166:25.48]Any percent?
[166:27.70]Can't wait for that.
[166:28.26]That'll be fun.
[166:30.40]And then right after that, we have Linkus, who'll be running Wind Waker.
[166:34.12]What's it called?
[166:35.69]What's it called?
[166:36.37]Wind Waker.
[166:37.89]All dungeons.
[166:38.67]All dungeons.
[166:39.95]Wind Waker, all dungeons.
[166:41.19]And then we have Amrok.
[166:43.39]No.
[166:44.07]Then we have... Oh, yeah.
[166:45.05]Amrock.
[166:45.43]Amrock Runner.
[166:45.95]I thought the game was called Bob Toad.
[166:47.13]There's a muck.
[166:47.91]Yeah, I was confused.
[166:49.18]Bob Toad.
[166:49.98]It's called a muck.
[166:51.10]Am I saying it different than you?
[166:52.62]Yeah, you were.
[166:53.06]Let's say it together.
[166:53.70]One, two, three.
[166:54.66]Amrock.
[166:55.60]Well, I don't know.
[166:56.62]I feel like you said it a little differently there.
[166:58.24]Again.
[166:59.14]Amrock.
[166:59.86]Okay.
[167:00.28]You got to work on it.
[167:01.70]I feel like you got to... And then we have Titanfall 2, and we have a nice segment of people who are running offline, but Laura's coming up in just a bit here.
[167:11.42]after she gets all situated.
[167:12.68]How do you feel about that run, guys?
[167:15.90]W run.
[167:16.38]That was good.
[167:16.82]Yeah, that was great.
[167:18.08]I loved watching it.
[167:18.70]It was wonderful.
[167:19.44]Yeah, I feel like we still do the full tier list, you know?
[167:22.56]But, like, a lot of them were really good.
[167:25.16]He was throwing stuff out.
[167:26.12]I feel like I was learning, but also learning to love.
[167:28.81]Yeah, we kind of did learn something about ourselves.
[167:31.53]I did learn something along the way.
[167:32.83]Yeah, I felt something, you know?
[167:34.17]Because, like, I watched a lot of speed runs, but, like, the whole time for the life of me, I couldn't think, like, why the fuck did he get married?
[167:41.66]Because he hired the guy.
[167:45.02]I think the guy would have fought for him, but was the marriage thing necessary?
[167:48.56]Maybe there's a love bond and it makes them stronger.
[167:51.61]More health.
[167:53.65]They would fight against one of the guards, but then if they're married, they see Doug get hit and they're like...
[167:57.95]No!
[167:59.09]Lightning attack!
[168:00.22]Kill that child!
[168:02.24]That kept replaying in my head.
[168:03.84]I had to just put... It was so funny.
[168:07.64]There was two crow hops.
[168:09.45]That kid was just looking straight ahead.
[168:12.37]It was just going... That axe was going right for that kid's head.
[168:15.43]It was like, no way.
[168:16.39]The kid looking for it, and then just... I'm not any fucking part of this.
[168:20.14]I'm just kidding.
[168:21.00]just walked away I guess I gotta take it yeah oh that's just very funny the last yarl I think is uh I would say a plus s tier maybe because of the big boom oh yeah that was cool the big boom was cool and he sat down on the bench amazing yeah amazing that was very well a fighter who was the worst yarl oh one of the early ones the sleeping one it was a sleeping one I just felt really bad cheese
[168:47.82]That does bump it up a little bit.
[168:48.92]I will admit.
[168:49.46]She's got cheese in her pocket.
[168:51.28]Maybe that makes it weird.
[168:52.67]Alright.
[168:54.79]That's good right there.
[168:55.73]You wake up at 3 AM, ah.
[168:58.01]Yeah, when I go to bed, I like to always lay down with four plates, two forks, a helmet, a slice of cheese, and five or six bottles of booze.
[169:08.44]Yeah, this is what I do.
[169:09.42]Oh, and like 50 gold coins.
[169:12.59]Just in case.
[169:13.49]Yeah, just in case.
[169:14.71]I need it.
[169:16.03]Doug, that was a great run.
[169:17.17]Thank you.
[169:17.51]Thank you for running it.
[169:18.25]That was a very good time.
[169:19.23]As somebody who doesn't know Skyrim, that is my story now.
[169:22.41]That's the only way to play the game.
[169:25.05]That's all it is.
[169:26.43]Yeah, Skyrim has a lot of glitches.
[169:29.53]There are a lot, a lot, a lot of glitches in Skyrim.
[169:31.99]Shocker.
[169:32.51]So some of the runs get really, really wild.
[169:35.29]You're like, what am I looking at?
[169:37.30]I'm looking at a guy who opened up.
[169:39.28]He's like 10 minutes into his first Blender tutorial.
[169:41.86]What?
[169:42.66]That's what it looks like.
[169:43.86]So you married that guy for a companion, right?
[169:46.04]You needed somebody to fight alongside you for the speed run.
[169:48.94]Sure.
[169:49.92]So you went faster because of it.
[169:52.26]Cause you had someone to take care of.
[169:54.12]Yeah, sure.
[169:54.72]Okay.
[169:54.98]Nice.
[169:55.32]Nice.
[169:55.56]That's true.
[169:56.22]There were, there were lightning bolts coming out as well.
[169:58.62]Yeah.
[169:58.94]There was a real chemistry there.
[170:02.35]Yeah.
[170:03.01]Yeah.
[170:03.37]Lightning bolts, both in chemistry and in vicious violence.
[170:07.25]It's mostly for the sex.
[170:11.49]It's not being around the bush.
[170:13.25]I think I just heard my mic.
[170:14.47]It did not see that part of the run.
[170:16.43]Alright.
[170:16.65]We're going to go into Spyro.
[170:18.51]I'm going to hop on.
[170:19.55]Alright.
[170:19.90]Josh up here.
[170:20.54]Let's get more runs.
[170:23.60]That was awesome.
[170:26.82]I mean, I don't, I won't have anything to say for Spyro.
[170:30.98]Oh, okay.
[170:33.00]The Jerma Bloxians.
[170:35.56]Thanks for the $5.
[170:36.00]This donation is from the Jerma Bloxians.
[170:39.79]Um,
[170:41.54]You know, you're iconic and beautiful and never change.
[170:45.50]Full amount of gems per level go from about 100 to 200 to 300 to 400 here.
[170:50.42]So this is where we're going to start putting in a lot of work.
[170:52.61]And this level, the next level and the level after that all have three big tricks.
[170:58.71]These are the three big peacekeepers tricks.
[171:01.27]One is Dry Canyon Jump, which is just a really tight glide that kills a lot of runs.
[171:06.37]The next one after that is Mama Proxy.
[171:09.40]And the one after that is just Cliff Jump, which isn't that bad.
[171:12.24]I've got like a 90% consistency with that.
[171:14.44]So hopefully we don't have to worry about Cliff Jump.
[171:16.56]But this jump coming up here, Dry Canyon Jump, I'm sweating, not going to lie.
[171:20.83]Oh, you got this.
[171:21.81]You got this easy.
[171:22.97]You're locked in.
[171:23.79]I'm locked in.
[171:24.45]I'm ready to go.
[171:25.25]We're getting that sub 40 today.
[171:27.43]Oh, yeah.
[171:28.91]We got a $50 donation from Wekins.
[171:32.26]Hi, Xander's sister, an inventor of just egg percent here.
[171:34.82]Just egg victory lap.
[171:36.93]Matt, just egg?
[171:38.25]I had record in that category for a while.
[171:39.65]You have to get all the eggs in the game without touching anything else.
[171:43.33]Oh my god.
[171:44.63]That's a cool low percent.
[171:45.43]All good.
[171:46.27]No worries, no worries.
[171:47.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[171:48.69]So we're just going to go the safe way here.
[171:50.57]We're just going to jump across this little bulbous cactus.
[171:53.09]I like this game because you collect gems.
[171:56.75]Are you a gem collector yourself, Gemma?
[171:58.17]I love gems.
[171:59.05]Gemma, I've got a question for you.
[172:00.51]Sure.
[172:01.03]What flavor do you think the red gems are?
[172:03.12]Cherry, 100%.
[172:03.54]Agreed.
[172:04.80]Thank you.
[172:05.38]Yes.
[172:05.86]Thank you.
[172:06.32]Honestly, it couldn't be anything else.
[172:08.16]Fruit punch is the second answer.
[172:09.61]That's fair.
[172:10.35]That's fair.
[172:10.65]You're right.
[172:11.07]I would have said strawberry.
[172:12.23]I would have gone strawberry.
[172:13.13]Mm-hmm.
[172:14.58]Alright, so I'm... Alright, admission of guilt.
[172:17.66]I'm actually doing a very experimental route on this run because hypothetically, it's faster.
[172:22.94]I spent about a week and a half just labbing and crunching numbers.
[172:27.17]I've got like this whole messy spreadsheet of gem detours and stuff.
[172:30.81]Hypothetically, this route is faster.
[172:32.61]I'm going to give it a go.
[172:33.35]It does mean that we are going to be skipping about 40 gems at the start of this level and going straight to Mama Proxy.
[172:39.01]So here we go.
[172:40.71]Here we go.
[172:42.50]That's part one.
[172:46.36]Now, that was Mama Proxy you just did?
[172:48.60]Yep.
[172:49.18]There we go.
[172:50.94]Okay.
[172:52.72]That was pretty clean.
[172:53.22]Crazy trick.
[172:54.42]That is the second major choke point of the run.
[172:57.14]A lot of runs will die to that.
[172:58.72]It's one of those tricks that's faster to go for again if you miss it as opposed to Dry Canyon Jump where I just took the safe way.
[173:04.63]But, yeah, we don't have to worry about that.
[173:06.37]Oh, my God, Laura.
[173:07.49]So here we are in Clifftown.
[173:08.97]We're going to be doing a few unintended jumps here.
[173:10.85]We're going to be turning back on ourselves here, going up here.
[173:13.26]We're not supposed to be here early.
[173:14.82]And this little red firework, not supposed to flame that early, but we have it anyway.
[173:20.34]And by flaming that red firework, it's going to shoot off and break a strong chest that has about 25 gems in it later on in the level.
[173:28.07]So hell yeah, we love gems.
[173:30.26]We got another $100 donation.
[173:34.48]Incredible.
[173:36.86]From Shemp, Laura, I am so insanely proud of you.
[173:40.08]You've come so far and you're only going to go farther.
[173:42.06]I love you.
[173:42.90]Love you, Shemp.
[173:44.02]That's my good buddy right there.
[173:46.46]They housed me for two and a half months when I was on a little trip to Texas to stay there for a while.
[173:52.04]So I'm immensely grateful for that.
[173:54.14]It was an amazing time.
[173:55.24]That's awesome.
[173:58.15]Nice!
[173:59.39]Love Clifftown.
[174:02.09]Visit every summer, you know.
[174:04.41]Alright, so now we're coming up to... Oh, I'm super underjammed, actually.
[174:07.84]I better be careful.
[174:08.96]It's fine.
[174:09.32]We're going to be making up a lot of gems later on, kind of halfway through the run.
[174:12.64]But here we are in Dr. Shemp.
[174:13.82]I've kind of routed this out in a way that's going to be kind of difficult for me because I've got what's called a power jump right at the start here where, well, it's not going to look particularly amazing, but it's kind of tough.
[174:23.92]Bear with me.
[174:26.71]And now see where the Shemp comes from.
[174:28.53]Yeah, right there.
[174:31.32]Just made that connection.
[174:33.63]I did the power jump.
[174:34.43]It really does not look like much, but I promise it's way more precise than it lets on.
[174:38.49]You have to kind of jump then charge into the ground and then hold a charge jump on slanted geometry and then jump off it.
[174:46.17]It gives you like a boosted jump.
[174:48.06]And by doing that, it cut out like a two second detour where we get some gems that aren't really worth it.
[174:52.70]So I'm pretty happy to hit that.
[174:54.86]Nice.
[174:56.12]Hey, I keep interrupting this, but we got another $100 donation.
[174:59.24]Insane.
[175:03.06]From Champ saying, Cinnamon Toast Crunch Gang.
[175:05.94]Great work, runners and organizers.
[175:07.46]Awesome event.
[175:09.11]Champ, you're the best.
[175:10.49]Nice.
[175:10.91]Okay, that was Cliff Jump.
[175:12.11]Nice.
[175:12.85]I was going to say, that looked difficult.
[175:15.97]Two for three on the Major Peacekeepers tricks, which is absolutely fucking solid.
[175:21.80]I'm so used to other marathon runs where I can't swear.
[175:24.58]So I was like, uh-oh.
[175:25.56]Am I in trouble?
[175:26.72]No, no, no, no.
[175:27.75]Oh yeah, we gotta take you off here, you know.
[175:29.29]I'm good.
[175:30.39]I'm good.
[175:30.81]I can let the sailor mouth loose a little.
[175:34.70]So we're coming into the first flight level of the run here.
[175:37.08]And you might be wondering, why are we going into a flight level when there are no gems to collect?
[175:40.74]You'd be wrong, mister.
[175:42.44]After completing all four of the eight little object collection mini game thing here, we get awarded a 300 gem bonus.
[175:51.74]Oh.
[175:51.96]So we've just got to get through this as fast as possible.
[175:54.38]And I missed that ring.
[175:55.22]Did it look like I missed it?
[175:56.62]It did not.
[175:57.32]No, not at all.
[175:58.28]I didn't see anything.
[176:00.50]Honestly, you got it.
[176:02.05]I need glasses, you know?
[176:03.73]Yeah, sometimes the hit detection in these flight levels can be a little bit weird, but not to worry.
[176:08.65]Thankfully, everything in this flight level in particular is completely static.
[176:11.97]There aren't any cycles that I have to worry about.
[176:13.77]So I really did just lose the amount of time it took to turn around and get that.
[176:17.99]Now, is this your favorite of the flight levels?
[176:20.39]Actually, it is not.
[176:21.17]My favorite would be the last one, Icy Flight.
[176:23.17]And that's a very unpopular opinion because that's very cycle heavy.
[176:26.79]It's got a very awkward turn with flaming a chest in the middle of it.
[176:31.23]But I love it.
[176:31.95]I adore it.
[176:33.67]I guess I forgot that Spyro can fly.
[176:37.16]I don't know why I didn't think about that.
[176:39.78]I mean, to be fair, in 90% of the game, you're just gliding, but the lore is that in these flying sections specifically, his wings grow for absolutely no apparent reason, and then he can fly.
[176:50.70]Ah, yes.
[176:51.68]Completely arbitrary.
[176:54.74]But we're good.
[176:55.70]We're through.
[176:56.14]We're at 1193 gems, which is... Wait, I need that.
[176:59.26]Thank you.
[177:00.91]We are about... I want to say like 20 gems under.
[177:04.35]It's not that bad.
[177:05.33]If I just focus up and make sure to get everything that's in my way from here on for a bit, we can make this back up.
[177:10.37]You got it.
[177:11.53]We got a $125 donation.
[177:15.75]Insane from Dehydrated.
[177:17.93]For the kids, go Laura.
[177:18.85]Shout out to everyone involved with this event.
[177:21.22]We also got a $50 from Shemp But Again.
[177:23.62]Also me and Ella are watching together, giggling and cheering.
[177:25.48]Lock in.
[177:26.74]Shout-outs to Ella.
[177:27.70]And then Barry Fox is with the $50 as well.
[177:30.02]Shout-out to my lovelies Laura and Josh.
[177:31.49]So proud of you for showing up for the PlayStation Nation.
[177:33.61]Hi, Barry.
[177:34.03]He's rolling in.
[177:36.21]Dude, so many donations.
[177:37.81]You guys are killing it today.
[177:40.15]Nice.
[177:40.73]The might of the PlayStation Nation pulling up right now.
[177:44.71]Alright, so we're in Ice Cavern, there's pretty much nothing special going on here.
[177:47.49]This is the level with the most amount of dragons, and so whilst it looks like we're not getting too many gems in the way, we really are just beelining from dragon to dragon here.
[177:56.82]We can't skip any of these.
[177:58.46]The only homeworld in the entire game where we don't skip any of the dragons is Magic Rockless, and that's the one coming up after this level, which is also the homeworld I'm very much most excited for because
[178:10.19]The movement is fantastic in there and there's a massive long supercharge that I routed back in that is kind of going to be like a make or break moment for the run.
[178:19.94]So we'll see how that goes.
[178:23.26]But till then, there's pretty much nothing going on.
[178:25.34]What's up for you guys?
[178:26.56]Well, we got another donation.
[178:31.71]We got a $50 donation from Two Blanks.
[178:33.89]Laura, drop the lore.
[178:34.85]What is the best PlayStation game out of Street Boys, Smarties, and Eye Toy?
[178:38.63]Oh, no.
[178:39.35]Don't make me choose.
[178:41.68]Dude!
[178:42.74]Wait, is that with the camera?
[178:44.88]The PlayStation camera?
[178:47.74]I played with that for a little while.
[178:49.16]It's so fun.
[178:50.07]I'm going to say it's Street Boys.
[178:54.40]I'm going to say it's Street Boys.
[178:55.42]Controversial take, but we'll take it.
[178:57.77]We love Street Boys.
[178:58.93]I'm sure in chat right now there's a bunch of Street Boys.
[179:01.51]By the way, I love when you run into people in this game and they just kind of go like... Some of the sound effects in this game are absolutely platinum.
[179:09.62]You're pushing them off cliffs, too.
[179:11.24]I mean, they've got families.
[179:12.93]What are you doing to them?
[179:15.43]I'm glad to say they don't actually have families.
[179:17.57]The lore of this, it's super easy to miss, is that the big boss of the game, NastyNork, whose real name is Reginald, by the way, that's a lie.
[179:25.67]I believed you.
[179:28.99]I haven't played before.
[179:30.63]You can tell me anything about this.
[179:33.66]He turned the gems into his minions.
[179:35.98]That's the lore.
[179:36.60]That's why when we kill them, we get their gems back.
[179:38.74]That's the lore on that.
[179:40.90]Was that the truth, lore?
[179:42.46]What, that his name is Reginald?
[179:43.70]No, no, no.
[179:44.24]About the gems thing?
[179:45.42]Yeah, that's true.
[179:46.26]The Reginald thing is not.
[179:47.52]I just don't know if I can believe you anymore, though.
[179:49.40]You lied to me once.
[179:50.18]I've completely dashed my credibility in a matter of seconds.
[179:53.87]It's all gone.
[179:54.87]It's only down here from here.
[179:57.04]Are there bosses in Spyro games?
[179:58.72]There are bosses, and we haven't seen any just yet.
[180:01.44]We didn't go into the boss level of the first hub world, and we did go to the boss level of the second hub world, but we didn't see the boss.
[180:07.35]Oh, okay.
[180:07.77]This hub world is where we're going to be seeing the first boss in the run, and really, honestly, if I didn't point it out, you probably wouldn't be able to tell that they're bosses, because the boss fights in this game, in quotes, fights, they really are just big enemies that you flame once, they move to another position, you flame them again, they move to another position, like...
[180:26.24]Really nothing to worry about.
[180:27.36]Really?
[180:27.76]Cool.
[180:28.08]Okay.
[180:30.10]I think I am actually going to shush my gums for a second here because I am dropping gems like flies.
[180:37.00]So I'm going to work on this a bit.
[180:40.70]Yeah, no worries.
[180:41.52]Yeah.
[180:41.84]We got a $50 donation from Suop.
[180:45.18]I apologize if I'm butchering any of these names.
[180:46.95]So proud of you, Laura.
[180:47.57]You've got this.
[180:48.37]Also, who do you main in melee?
[180:50.25]This could make or break your punchline.
[180:51.85]Oh, God.
[180:53.39]You say that because I've been playing a lot of melee today, right?
[180:56.91]Because we have a setup here at Fast 50, and I'm garbage at it.
[181:00.21]I've just been flip-flopping on characters all day, but I came to the realization that...
[181:07.27]I came to the realization that actually my best character is Ness of all things.
[181:11.58]Really?
[181:12.18]A Ness player?
[181:13.32]Yeah, I'm going to stick with Ness.
[181:14.72]He's my boy.
[181:16.88]But if I picked up melee with the intention of actually learning it properly, I would say Falco.
[181:24.53]I would love to learn Falco.
[181:25.59]He looks very sick.
[181:27.51]I got to say, Glock in my Toyota, he's a... I know, that's like a jarring username to say, by the way.
[181:35.00]He's a monster at Melee.
[181:36.50]He's so good.
[181:37.78]And I was so happy to take just 1% off this man.
[181:42.16]Just 1%.
[181:42.60]I cheered...
[181:45.38]joyfully it's always the weirdest names yeah I came across this YouTuber the other day tomato anus amazing amazing speed running YouTuber YouTuber I kid you not makes great videos like a man I was like why did you name yourself that oh my god am I going the right way there seems to be a wall here wait wait whoa oh my god wow what okay you gotta explain that you gotta explain that here's the explanation there's a hole there
[182:12.42]Fantastic.
[182:12.92]There's just no collision?
[182:14.08]There's just a hole, yeah.
[182:15.34]Wow.
[182:15.82]They, for some reason, just completely oversaw it that someone might want to glide into that wall.
[182:20.50]Huh.
[182:21.16]Which is really interesting because there's a bunch, oh, there's a really important spot later in the run where they took collision away where they didn't expect people to be going to.
[182:29.32]Ruined my life, I'll tell you that much.
[182:31.86]But we'll get to that when we get to it.
[182:33.78]So we're coming up to high caves here.
[182:35.90]And this is the level with the big trick that I told you about that could either make or break the run.
[182:39.40]So I will be shutting up when I come near to it.
[182:41.81]Yep.
[182:42.27]We're quiet for it.
[182:44.25]We got it.
[182:44.59]So let's know what's happening.
[182:45.67]I'm crunching the numbers here.
[182:47.33]1840 is my gem count.
[182:48.15]I think I want about 1900 on my usual route, and I'm going to get an extra 100 here.
[182:52.53]So I think if everything goes well, I'll be up 40 gems compared to the route that's done in record.
[182:59.95]So we'll have to see.
[183:02.83]But we just got some little cycle-based platforming here.
[183:05.25]Going to be getting these guys out of the way.
[183:06.89]Ow.
[183:08.53]We have a quick $50 donation from the Rixxer.
[183:11.53]Best of luck with the run, Laura.
[183:12.51]Shout out to my main man, Josh, on the couch.
[183:14.95]Big heart to let in the game for bringing this together.
[183:16.97]Let's go, PlayStation Nation.
[183:17.99]Shout out to Ricky.
[183:18.91]We love Ricky.
[183:19.61]Hell yeah.
[183:23.17]Oh, boy.
[183:23.77]Alright.
[183:24.23]You got this.
[183:24.99]You got it.
[183:26.11]Just one more dragon and then that's it.
[183:27.99]Then that's it.
[183:30.07]Zip it.
[183:31.27]Then it's go time.
[183:32.17]Not you, me.
[183:32.81]I'm going to zip it.
[183:33.54]We've locked in.
[183:34.22]We've locked in.
[183:49.50]I've got to do an extra turn here.
[184:00.76]Ah, so close.
[184:03.76]That's okay.
[184:04.68]The movement there is crazy.
[184:06.22]Oh, my God.
[184:06.56]That was incredible.
[184:08.79]That was great.
[184:10.37]So let me give you the lore on that.
[184:12.73]That trick is called Bite Caves.
[184:14.85]It's called Bite Caves because...
[184:17.05]Oh, my God.
[184:17.71]Actually, I can't get into that.
[184:18.97]It's something to do with the Spyro Skype group back in 2013, and they kept spamming the bike emoji.
[184:26.09]Something to do with that.
[184:27.46]But pretty much, the lore is that that trick gave me so much grief a few years ago when I was properly trying to get to be a high-level runner in this game.
[184:37.66]I just straight up took it out the route.
[184:39.26]I took it out the route, and I backed up the gems with a bunch more in different places.
[184:43.13]And it ended up being so efficient of a route
[184:46.29]that everyone else adopted it.
[184:47.83]And now the current record does not do bike caves.
[184:50.31]The current record still uses the route that I made a couple years ago.
[184:53.49]Wow.
[184:54.17]That's insane.
[184:56.40]Speaking of record, I'll use the platform to brag.
[185:00.16]I had it five times.
[185:01.15]You know what?
[185:03.31]Hey, you deserve to brag for that.
[185:04.95]Hell yeah.
[185:05.39]Flex, it's alright.
[185:07.13]I'm thinking about coming back to the grind and trying to get record back, but it's just recently been made insanely hard of an endeavor because top-level runner Deoman recently got a 37.03 in this category, which is fucking ridiculous.
[185:24.44]Buddy.
[185:25.40]Like, seriously.
[185:27.12]In 2021, he got the first 37, and we all thought the category was done and dusted there.
[185:32.52]Seriously.
[185:33.11]We thought 37 was the upper limit of the category.
[185:36.45]Like, maybe someone would take it down by an additional 10 seconds.
[185:39.33]Now y'all are approaching 36.
[185:42.80]We're pushing 36, and someone's going to get it.
[185:45.85]Could be you.
[185:46.65]Could be me.
[185:47.31]Could be you.
[185:47.91]Could either be me, could be Deo, or it could be the other runner, Asriel.
[185:51.18]Could be any of the three of us.
[185:52.42]Or it could be a surprise newcomer.
[185:53.70]Who knows?
[185:54.26]Hey, I don't know.
[185:55.38]Jerma, you can pick up Spinar Speedrunning.
[185:57.64]It'd be the first time I've ever played the game, but I'll do it.
[186:01.76]We have a $200 donation from Alekhine.
[186:07.13]Keep up the love, both with helping people and the love of speedrunning.
[186:10.92]Speedrunning is genuinely fantastic.
[186:13.18]I got a soapbox about this a little bit.
[186:14.72]Speedrunning genuinely changed my life.
[186:16.82]You know?
[186:17.74]Like, before speedrunning, I was just working this dumbass retail job in the middle of COVID.
[186:22.90]Yeah!
[186:23.86]Like, I was doing, like, the online grocery shopping shit in the middle of COVID, and I was the only one in my department, right?
[186:29.77]12 orders an hour, 8 hours a day, you know, lifting these stupid heavy crates of groceries for people who just did not give a shit.
[186:38.65]Like...
[186:41.41]I'm so glad I get to play this 1998 children's game and pick up colourful gems for you.
[186:46.52]Hey, that's the spirit.
[186:48.31]Yeah!
[186:50.56]I'm lucky to be here and doing what I'm doing.
[186:53.30]So I guess the moral of the story, count your blessings, you know?
[186:56.88]Alright.
[186:57.46]So let's see if I get this.
[186:59.12]Whoa!
[187:00.24]So that was the only... What was that?
[187:01.72]That was a dragon skip.
[187:02.74]That's called Baldar Skip.
[187:04.05]And basically the principle for that is that when you enter a portal in this game, Spyro actually flies out the other side.
[187:11.05]It just visually doesn't look like it to create the seamless effect.
[187:15.03]And by doing that, we actually flew into the dragon and had the load of the level interrupt it.
[187:21.15]so that the dragon is considered collected, but we don't have to sit back and watch the cutscene or anything.
[187:26.43]How much does that save?
[187:28.45]I've never timed it with, like, safely picking up the dragon and getting it from an optimal angle.
[187:34.77]I would hazard a guess and say it saves about six to eight seconds.
[187:37.78]Okay, that's pretty decent.
[187:39.08]Yeah, it's really not that bad.
[187:40.42]And it's not a risky strat at all.
[187:42.82]Like, as long as you learn to hold one of the shoulder buttons to get the camera in a funny position as you jump in, it's super consistent.
[187:50.15]I think I've missed it maybe... I forgot I didn't kill you.
[187:53.45]I think I've missed it maybe, like, three or four times.
[187:56.89]It's the same thing to hear.
[187:57.91]You need to die.
[188:00.66]You need to die.
[188:02.10]You need to perish.
[188:03.80]Alright.
[188:04.42]Where are my gem count at?
[188:05.84]Where is it at?
[188:07.19]We have got... Oh, that's clean.
[188:09.13]Nice.
[188:09.37]Oh, that's perfect.
[188:10.86]Oh, 3,000.
[188:12.36]3,000.
[188:12.42]Wow.
[188:13.20]Halfway there.
[188:14.72]Exactly halfway there on gems.
[188:16.28]And that means with these bunch of gems, it's probably going to put us at about 49 extra?
[188:21.30]48 extra.
[188:23.07]Okay.
[188:23.35]Nice.
[188:26.56]Perfect.
[188:27.08]So yeah, we are about 48 gems up, which is fantastic because we're going to use those additional gems to cut back and save time in some upcoming levels.
[188:36.23]So I see you menuing at the end of some levels.
[188:38.89]Is that because you don't have a definitive end, so you want to get some more gems there?
[188:42.94]Yes, so you're absolutely not required in this run to go through any of the end vortexes.
[188:48.58]You can just exit out at any point, which absolutely frees up the routing for this game.
[188:53.61]But you know what?
[188:54.61]Just for the shits of it, I'm super tempted.
[188:57.07]Nice!
[188:57.57]Nice!
[188:58.67]Wow!
[189:00.84]Did not expect to catch that.
[189:02.14]I severely beefed the start of the level.
[189:04.46]So I'm pretty happy that I caught that cycle.
[189:06.93]But yeah, just for the shits and giggles, I'm going to go through the exit vortex at the end of this because it's directly near the end.
[189:14.50]I love what they called this boss.
[189:17.15]Blowhard?
[189:18.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[189:20.53]Insomniac.
[189:21.61]Hey, I'm not going to say anything, you know?
[189:24.80]It means he's a braggart.
[189:25.94]Grow up.
[189:29.55]Has there been any new Spyro media in the last five, ten years?
[189:34.04]I know they did the... I know I'm like, Dad on the couch.
[189:37.72]Any new games that they... What's the new game?
[189:41.00]Pokémon with flying.
[189:42.50]There's been the remake that came out in 2018, but since then it's been Radio Silence, but... They did Skylanders or something, didn't they?
[189:49.23]Yeah, Skylanders.
[189:50.81]Is that Spyro?
[189:51.67]I think they were connected.
[189:52.99]I remember seeing that it was connected somehow.
[189:55.62]Yeah, it's up for debate.
[189:56.48]The first Skylanders game was called Skylanders Spyro Adventure, but Spyro took a backseat by the next game, and then he just kind of got pushed aside.
[190:05.52]It wasn't about Spyro anymore from there on.
[190:08.23]But after that, we got the remake.
[190:11.05]But after that, it's been radio silence until very, very recently.
[190:15.15]We've kind of been seeing some insider scoops that allegedly Spyro 4 is now in development.
[190:21.98]Something to look forward to?
[190:23.06]Yeah, maybe we'll have to wait and see.
[190:24.70]I'd like to see it happen.
[190:26.90]Breaking news, it's going to come with the release of Silksong, actually.
[190:33.13]Any day now.
[190:33.97]Any day now.
[190:35.49]Alright, so here we are in Beastmakers, and if you've played through this game casually at all, you'll be seeing some levels that may or may not have made you spike your controller once or twice.
[190:45.82]But not right now, because we're in Wild Flight, and this flight usually isn't something to worry about.
[190:51.07]It does kill my run sometimes, but that's only because I push it super hard, and I'm not going to be doing that here.
[190:56.39]Ironic that it's the Wild Flight, and you're not too worried about it.
[190:58.91]That's super tame.
[191:00.78]We have a $50 donation from DJ.
[191:03.10]Always glad to see PlayStation Nation show up.
[191:04.96]Thanks Josh for the amazing Jack run and good luck, Laura.
[191:08.29]And we have a quick $20 donation from Grapevine.
[191:10.75]Don't tell Laura that I secretly support her.
[191:13.59]I couldn't even hear that, huh?
[191:16.29]All love.
[191:17.29]All love.
[191:18.11]Thanks, Grapevine.
[191:19.05]I'm definitely not going to punch you in the face when I see you.
[191:25.02]Oh, my God.
[191:26.94]I'm learning this for the first time here, you know?
[191:28.62]Me and Grapevine, we got that love-hate bromance going on.
[191:31.92]It's chill.
[191:32.42]It's chill.
[191:34.56]Love that guy, though, really.
[191:36.56]And we have a $55 donation from Derek Lander.
[191:40.01]Hi, Laura.
[191:41.31]Say, I'm so proud of you for representing the PlayStation Nation.
[191:44.11]They're really showing up today.
[191:45.59]Oh, my God.
[191:45.92]Wow.
[191:46.20]Lots of love.
[191:46.90]We love Derek Lander as well.
[191:48.26]Very talented Sprash Vector runner, actually.
[191:51.32]The Sprash Vector is, like, 100%ing all three Spyro and all three Crash games in one sitting.
[191:56.47]Crazy Bastard can do it in like 12 hours, which is absolutely ballistic.
[192:04.03]I could not even imagine doing that.
[192:05.75]I haven't even... I 100% crashed too casually a couple of weeks ago, and it took me six hours alone, you know?
[192:13.85]So six games?
[192:15.33]Yep, six whole games, 100% back-to-back, 12 hours.
[192:18.55]Oh, my God.
[192:19.11]I can't even imagine.
[192:20.03]It is ridiculous.
[192:20.97]Alright, here we are in Misty Bog.
[192:22.37]I've actually got a really good gen count now.
[192:24.37]I've got nothing to worry about, but this level is full of some really annoying enemies that we're just going to have to play really carefully and, you know, space out our flames and stuff here.
[192:34.26]There's also a fair bit of RNG.
[192:35.84]Yeah, we've got the bad pattern there.
[192:37.92]Nothing to worry about.
[192:38.58]We're just going to have to do a double kill there, turn it around.
[192:41.16]It's always the bogs and swamps.
[192:42.96]It really is the bogs.
[192:44.87]Shout-outs to Jack1BoggySwamp.
[192:46.71]I don't know if that level is particularly annoying in the run at all, but I'm willing to bet it is.
[192:52.23]It is.
[192:52.51]It is.
[192:53.07]Of course it is.
[192:54.25]Some people just make a game where it's just only bogs.
[192:57.85]Just bogs.
[192:59.05]It's bogs and swamps.
[193:00.29]That's the title.
[193:00.97]Oops.
[193:01.11]All bogs.
[193:02.35]Oops.
[193:02.87]All bogs.
[193:03.79]Hey, free money right there.
[193:06.41]Yeah, it's bogs and swamps, colon, fuck you.
[193:12.77]Alright, so we've got some extra RNG coming up here.
[193:16.16]These patterns that these frogs like to jump in.
[193:18.32]Oh, that's the good pattern.
[193:19.28]Thank you very much.
[193:20.91]Yeah, they just like to jump.
[193:22.93]either out of your way or in your way, and it can really mess you up if you're on pace here.
[193:26.97]You need really good attention.
[193:28.53]I've lost my words.
[193:31.47]You need really good levels of focus and being able to adapt.
[193:34.41]There we go.
[193:34.87]That's the word I was looking for.
[193:35.67]Those boars are a little aggressive.
[193:37.91]They are aggressive, but thankfully we can do a technique on them.
[193:40.65]I haven't even explained flame charging yet.
[193:42.42]We can do a technique on them called flame charging, where pretty much...
[193:47.10]If you charge through an enemy or a box in this game, the gem hones in on you like that, right?
[193:53.58]But if we flame an enemy and then charge as the flame connects, we can pretty much trick the game into thinking we charged it and get the gem to hone in on us from a greater distance.
[194:03.20]And that also applies to some enemies that are too big to be charged, like they're invulnerable to charging.
[194:08.34]But we can Flame Charge them, which means we can just grab their gem and keep moving without stopping.
[194:12.18]It's pretty tight of a trick, especially when it comes to those boars.
[194:15.88]But yeah, nothing to worry about.
[194:17.55]No more boars in this level, thank God.
[194:18.77]Especially in the bog.
[194:21.03]And the swamp.
[194:21.91]And the swamp.
[194:22.95]We're coming up to a section here.
[194:25.29]I'm going to say what the community calls it.
[194:26.81]The community calls this Guantanamo Bay.
[194:30.77]Do I ask?
[194:31.37]You'll see why.
[194:32.23]Okay, okay.
[194:33.03]Look at this shit.
[194:33.81]Jesus.
[194:37.61]Love speedrunning.
[194:39.11]I love speedrunning.
[194:41.33]Oh, my God.
[194:42.24]Beautiful.
[194:44.80]Oh, my goodness.
[194:45.46]Alright, so four dragons left to go in the route and about 1800 gems, I think.
[194:51.90]We got 436 in this level, which is actually way more than I needed.
[194:56.27]So you take all these gems and put them in a bag and just drop them in front of the final boss going like, yeah, there's your payment.
[195:01.73]Look what I got.
[195:02.63]Get out of here.
[195:03.44]We have a $200 donation.
[195:07.24]Wow, from KMEGS.
[195:10.28]Laura, hello, new fan here.
[195:11.84]Y'all are awesome.
[195:13.60]Thank you so much.
[195:14.38]Yeah, I mean, why?
[195:18.37]And that just put us over $120,000.
[195:19.59]Wow.
[195:20.11]Of course it's 120, dude.
[195:24.53]Of course it's 120.
[195:25.91]120.
[195:25.95]Got to add it back now.
[195:27.97]Of course.
[195:28.81]Alright.
[195:29.15]So I'm in the middle of something here called the thief race.
[195:32.04]This green thief that's waking up all these enemies, I need to get in front of him and beat him to this dragon over here.
[195:36.74]Looks like I succeeded because doing that when he reaches this ramp,
[195:41.02]what we're supposed to do is follow him and you know he leads us down this complicated series of supercharges but we're literally just going to jump off to the left and skip all of that
[195:50.70]oh I love that he's teleported to this island which saves a bunch of time and uh a lot of headache I love how like his name his name is just jed jed jed like like you know you get like rothnar the the world feeling and then you get jed yeah it's just like over there chill and then there's a Barry 63.
[196:13.28]Now, which dragon is your favorite?
[196:15.87]Oh, gotta be Gildas in Stonehill.
[196:18.29]I wish I got to show his cutscene because he's very much like that one very friendly grandpa in the family, you know?
[196:25.18]The one that always makes you feel comfortable and safe.
[196:28.12]How many characters in the game talk like this?
[196:31.88]Oh, thanks, babe.
[196:33.32]You saved me.
[196:35.16]At least four or five.
[196:36.50]For someone who's not played the game, that is actually frighteningly accurate.
[196:40.68]There's like eight of them that sound like that.
[196:45.37]Yeah, so it's like a running joke in this game that when a dragon doesn't have any advice for you, they'll literally just say, thank you for releasing me, and then just vanish.
[196:53.09]They'll just die.
[196:53.59]Alright, tricky boost coming up for me.
[196:57.62]nice nice nice nice I was worried about missing that because if I miss this not only is it like a 20 second time loss I could either take the 20 second time loss or lose out on like 60 to 70 gems and we're getting sub 40. we might be getting sub 40. I'm looking at that time over there and we seem to be on pace that looks really good we have got a lot of game let's start it I'm gonna start smashing this coach
[197:25.32]What did the couch ever do to you, Gemma?
[197:26.38]Come on.
[197:26.90]Wow.
[197:27.70]It's true.
[197:29.61]It looked at you funny.
[197:31.87]Alright.
[197:32.29]We've got another annoying out of bounds here.
[197:39.08]Nice.
[197:39.34]Whoa!
[197:40.94]What a trick.
[197:41.42]That was gnarly.
[197:42.48]Yeah, so I had to do some weird setup there where I jump in the air, kind of like manipulate that enemy to not go out as far as he would.
[197:48.78]And then we charge him into the corner, we beat him into the corner, and then he lands on top of us and squeezes us right through.
[197:53.57]So I'm lucky I hit that.
[197:54.77]Saved about six seconds.
[197:56.94]We have a $120 donation, oh my god, from Spudlyman, saying, you will never take my category.
[198:07.50]Sorry, Spud.
[198:08.32]It's got to go, man.
[198:09.28]It's got to go.
[198:10.58]Don't tell Saboom.
[198:12.36]$120.
[198:12.97]All these $120 donations.
[198:14.33]You guys are crazy for this.
[198:16.69]So, I'd like to make it a point.
[198:19.09]We have gone past a boss fight already.
[198:20.81]Blowhard was one of the bosses.
[198:22.01]Wait, what?
[198:22.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[198:23.93]Since when?
[198:24.57]This is the other boss.
[198:25.47]This is Metalhead.
[198:26.90]Oh, shit.
[198:27.64]Metal head.
[198:28.80]And all we have to do is destroy these poles that disrupt his power supply and he goes on a little jog.
[198:33.81]Why not spread them out?
[198:38.40]I'm going to keep all of my life-saving shit in one room.
[198:43.42]No one will find out how to defeat me here.
[198:45.59]Don't worry.
[198:45.89]He's safe.
[198:46.47]He has two rooms.
[198:49.95]Oh.
[198:50.95]Surely nothing will go wrong.
[198:52.61]Nah.
[198:53.51]Nah.
[198:54.07]It's all in one spot again.
[198:57.33]Metalhead, you did it again.
[198:58.82]Come on.
[198:59.68]You put one of these things on the North Pole.
[199:02.40]You've got to spread them out.
[199:04.52]Yeah.
[199:07.33]He got tired, he took a nap, and then we got his gems.
[199:10.20]And then that's going to be pretty much the end of the level here.
[199:12.10]And that wraps up the... Well, there's a little bit of Beast Makers left.
[199:16.20]And then the next Hub World Dream Weavers is super short.
[199:19.58]We only go into two levels.
[199:20.70]We go into the flight level and the second to last boss level.
[199:24.78]And then what's coming up after that is what is going to... If the big supercharge didn't make or break the run, then the final Hub World absolutely will.
[199:33.51]We are coming up to a trick called Rat Proxy, where...
[199:37.41]Pretty much, we need to rely on this little rat fodder that usually just exists to give us health.
[199:43.65]We need him to stand in a very specific spot and then hit a two-frame charge window, line ourselves up perfectly, and get that rat to squeeze us into a corner and launch us up where the entrance to the final boss portal
[199:57.88]I missed a dragon whoa wait did I no am I I'm dumb as hell I'm actually didn't miss a dragon like there is just a hamster wheel up there and a very very tired hamster you know
[200:18.69]So, we're good.
[200:19.99]Like, you wouldn't believe that I've played this game over a bajillion times.
[200:24.00]You're just playing a little jig on us, you know?
[200:26.52]A little joke.
[200:27.18]A little trip.
[200:28.02]Fully intentional.
[200:29.50]Yeah, you got us.
[200:30.98]Yeah, once again.
[200:32.78]Whimsical Jape.
[200:34.32]A little damage boost coming up here.
[200:36.06]It's actually called Bitch Skip.
[200:39.23]I love speedrunners.
[200:40.23]I gotta get to Spyro.
[200:41.43]Dude, if you want to talk about wacky trick names, I know all of the Spyro 1 Vortex runners are cringing right now because I'm about to talk about the Vortex tricks names, okay?
[200:52.09]I mean, like, what other speedrunner has Guantanamo Bay?
[200:54.51]There is a trick in Dry Canyon called, I shit you not, Mickey's Dick Smasher.
[201:00.67]There is one in Alpine Ridge called Fish Ladder.
[201:03.59]Okay.
[201:04.81]There is one in Metalhead called Banana Boy Boyoyoying.
[201:09.26]Okay.
[201:09.80]These are beautiful.
[201:11.56]Also in Metalhead, there is WaffleSquap.
[201:14.74]But is there a banana?
[201:16.46]There is a banana.
[201:17.36]Okay, so there is a banana in the level.
[201:19.06]Is there a waffle?
[201:21.32]Waffle is the guy who found it, WaffleWizard1.
[201:24.22]That's his namesake.
[201:26.03]We also got a donation from Waffle in text, saying, Tash should be finished by now, by the way.
[201:31.03]Love from PlayStation Nation.
[201:32.29]Thanks, Waffle.
[201:33.09]You're a really constructive man.
[201:34.65]Thanks, buddy.
[201:35.37]Love you.
[201:38.60]No, we love Waffle.
[201:39.86]He's our resident shitpost.
[201:41.22]Honestly, one of the funniest guys I've ever met.
[201:43.84]Genuine delight when I'm in voice calls with him.
[201:46.12]You have no idea what's going to come out of his vocal cords next.
[201:48.42]Oh, man.
[201:52.30]What are you doing now?
[201:53.50]We're in the flight level, and we're done with the flight level.
[201:56.59]Just like that.
[201:57.55]Alright.
[201:57.85]So fast.
[201:58.15]Just grab ourselves an additional 300 gems, and we need 6,000.
[202:01.51]We are currently up to 5, 6, 2, 8.
[202:04.83]That's perfect.
[202:05.45]This is actually a really, really good gem count.
[202:08.03]Oh, my God.
[202:09.09]We're seeing it today.
[202:10.09]We're going to be able to cut out a few gems in this last level here, Jacques, which is the second to last boss level.
[202:15.65]You're going to love the boss.
[202:17.19]Seriously, you would not think it's a boss.
[202:19.23]I swear to God.
[202:20.15]You're confronting.
[202:21.55]I'm confronting him.
[202:22.39]Yeah.
[202:23.09]That seems a little aggressive.
[202:24.55]For his misdeeds.
[202:25.63]I thought that was him right there.
[202:26.67]I was like, yeah, that boss did suck.
[202:29.81]I was like, wow, you weren't kidding.
[202:31.65]That's it.
[202:32.71]That's the boss.
[202:35.28]He will be coming up.
[202:36.80]Tell me if you think you see Jacques, alright?
[202:42.08]Scanning.
[202:46.53]Did you kill him already?
[202:49.66]That was a ploy to get you to be silent for that trick, actually.
[202:53.70]She's playing us like a fiddle.
[202:55.94]Oh my god.
[202:57.10]She doesn't want to hear, are there bosses in this game?
[203:00.62]What are gems supposed to be used for?
[203:03.01]Here he is.
[203:03.51]This is Shark.
[203:04.67]This is him.
[203:05.63]We flame him once, he runs away.
[203:07.63]We flame him twice, he runs away.
[203:09.01]It looks more like a Carl.
[203:10.47]It looks like a Carl, yeah.
[203:13.93]We're going to glide over to him.
[203:15.74]He's going to attempt to hit us, but no, he's going to run away.
[203:18.44]And then we flame him and he dies.
[203:21.45]That was the boss.
[203:22.51]Bye, John.
[203:26.03]And we should be good to go.
[203:28.09]357 plus whatever number this is.
[203:31.65]Dropped a lot of money.
[203:32.69]Wow.
[203:32.93]6,006.
[203:34.40]We did it.
[203:36.62]Oh, 6,000.
[203:37.20]Alright.
[203:38.50]Sub 40 is absolutely on the line here.
[203:40.80]We've got about a minute to hit a successful rat proxy.
[203:45.20]Down to the wire.
[203:45.96]You got it.
[203:47.32]We'll see how it goes.
[203:48.24]I believe.
[203:50.50]I've been practicing this all day, man.
[203:52.56]There's a lot of RNG involved in this trick, but there's also a lot more human execution now than there used to be with the trick.
[204:00.71]Let's see how it goes.
[204:03.19]Good position.
[204:06.21]No dice.
[204:07.65]No worries.
[204:08.19]We go next.
[204:09.48]The real final boss.
[204:10.80]Yeah.
[204:11.10]The rat.
[204:11.54]The rat.
[204:12.60]I'm zero lives here, so if I hit, if I miss this.
[204:17.77]Oh, come on.
[204:18.73]Okay.
[204:19.05]We're going to have to tank a game over here.
[204:20.51]That's going to lose us a little bit of time.
[204:23.77]Really running on borrowed time here.
[204:25.11]I got to hit this quick.
[204:27.01]I think I've got maybe like one or two.
[204:28.37]You've got this.
[204:28.71]You've got this.
[204:29.53]Let's go.
[204:30.17]Let's go.
[204:30.55]Nope.
[204:36.29]One more go.
[204:36.91]I think this... No, we've got maybe two more tries.
[204:39.48]Oh, man.
[204:39.66]Oh, you got this.
[204:40.18]You got this.
[204:40.62]You got two more.
[204:41.44]You got two more.
[204:41.94]You got two more.
[204:42.28]Lock in.
[204:44.02]That's terrible.
[204:44.66]Come on.
[204:45.10]That's just really bad RNG.
[204:47.83]Yep.
[204:48.25]This one has to be it.
[204:51.87]No.
[204:52.17]What are you doing?
[204:57.23]That's it.
[204:57.75]Sub 40 is unfortunately gone because the boss fight itself takes a whole minute to get through.
[205:01.67]So that's it.
[205:02.65]Hey, no worries.
[205:03.57]This is insane.
[205:04.64]The RNG got me, unfortunately.
[205:06.14]That happens with speed runs.
[205:08.02]Yeah.
[205:08.68]Really excited to see this.
[205:09.64]Honestly, now that I've got time to go, I can experiment with other rat methods.
[205:13.81]What are you doing with the rat?
[205:16.99]Yeah, so what is going on?
[205:18.41]What's the attempt here?
[205:19.79]Yeah, so pretty much when we stand in front of that rat and Spyro's hitbox is tangential with the rat's hitbox, we can just tap square to charge and kill it instantly.
[205:27.52]And as it's dying, it's getting launched forward.
[205:30.28]And then as it's being launched forward, we are holding a direction to kind of stay on its hitbox as it pushes us.
[205:36.56]And then we just need to get squeezed between that and any other solid object.
[205:40.21]And it launches us upwards because the game assumes that we are stuck.
[205:43.23]Oh, wow.
[205:45.83]Really complicated stuff.
[205:46.99]That seems pretty complicated.
[205:48.43]Yeah.
[205:49.71]We're getting a lot of good launches, just not at good angles.
[205:53.30]Kind of tragic.
[205:54.14]Hey, it happens.
[205:54.80]It happens.
[205:55.34]It do happen.
[205:55.80]This is so cool.
[205:57.38]I'm actually going to go for a different trick here.
[205:59.11]I'm going to go for coveless.
[206:00.47]We get to see two tricks.
[206:03.31]I'd love to hit this.
[206:13.57]Yeah!
[206:13.71]Whoa!
[206:14.85]That's so cool!
[206:15.97]That was so sick!
[206:16.87]Oh my god!
[206:17.47]Who cares about sub 40?
[206:18.37]Let's go!
[206:19.20]Let's go!
[206:20.28]That's insane!
[206:21.66]That has never been hit at any fucking marathon.
[206:24.40]Whoa!
[206:26.70]Oh my god, Laura!
[206:28.83]Dude, I shit you not, that trick has been in two people's, no, three people's PBs.
[206:35.53]The guy who found it, Tuval, another guy named Groxu, and mine, right?
[206:39.73]That trick has been considered nothing short of TAS only for years.
[206:45.68]That trick is insanely hard, and pause buffers do help.
[206:49.10]I saw your pause buffer.
[206:50.10]I was like, oh my god, what are you doing?
[206:51.66]Pause buffers really help that trick, but it's still absolutely no slouch.
[206:56.14]That charge release I did at the start to get the initial boost, that's frame perfect.
[207:00.82]All of the adjustments I needed to do are borderline unit perfect.
[207:04.22]If I'm angled too far away, I won't get enough height.
[207:06.44]If I'm angled too far in, I'll immediately flop and lose all progress.
[207:10.04]I fucking nailed it, dude.
[207:11.86]Oh, you're killing it.
[207:14.34]Let's go, Laura.
[207:15.04]We're coming up on flame here.
[207:16.54]As soon as flame makes contact with nasty, that's the run.
[207:19.53]Is this a boss?
[207:20.43]Yeah, that's the boss.
[207:25.09]Yeah!
[207:25.61]41-18.
[207:26.25]Let's go.
[207:27.31]It wasn't a sub 40, but my God.
[207:29.35]You hit that trick, though.
[207:30.41]Oh, my God.
[207:32.41]What a run.
[207:34.99]Let's go, Laura.
[207:36.33]That's it.
[207:37.51]Oh, my God.
[207:39.32]Chilling.
[207:41.00]That was insane.
[207:42.80]I need a beverage.
[207:43.60]Mind if I get up?
[207:44.30]Yeah, there's a Red Bull right here, you know.
[207:48.04]Yeah!
[207:50.88]Shout out Red Bull.
[207:53.39]Shout out to the ball, shout out to Red Bull.
[207:58.25]Wow, wow, wow.
[207:59.01]Is this the right headset?
[208:00.35]Yeah, you got it, you got it.
[208:01.77]Oh, man.
[208:02.95]Well, what did you guys think?
[208:04.63]Phenomenal.
[208:05.69]That was crazy.
[208:06.49]Oh, my God.
[208:08.22]I didn't know Spyro was broken so wide open.
[208:10.36]I've never played Spyro, but I just saw it.
[208:12.18]I feel like we just played the whole game.
[208:15.58]You really did just see the whole thing because there are no major sequence breaks.
[208:19.00]You saw the very bare bones, but intended way to get through the game.
[208:24.47]So there you go.
[208:25.37]You know, some of those ways I wouldn't necessarily call intended.
[208:28.45]Yeah, there's like, you know, phasing through the wall at some point.
[208:31.23]I don't think I would do that in my playthrough.
[208:33.47]You're playing with a rat.
[208:35.27]How many rats were harmed in this?
[208:36.70]I don't know if that's, you know, intended.
[208:38.98]I did skip two levels at the end that I could have gone through.
[208:41.18]There is a safe way to get through that last hub world, which is just you go through one level, you go through the next level, and then those heads that I was jumping on, they open up.
[208:48.47]But yeah, no, didn't need to do that.
[208:50.05]41-18.
[208:50.11]Easy.
[208:53.13]Oh my God.
[208:54.89]PlayStation Nation showed up with the donations.
[208:57.09]Showed up and showed out.
[208:58.49]Hundreds on hundreds on hundreds.
[209:00.49]That was crazy.
[209:01.45]PlayStation Nation.
[209:04.03]Love those guys.
[209:05.19]Very proud to be a part of this amazing community.
[209:07.75]And yeah, obviously massive shout outs to Fast50 for having me, letting me show off this amazing run.
[209:13.89]I really hope I just did it justice, you know?
[209:15.94]Absolutely.
[209:16.34]Any shout-outs you want to give?
[209:17.52]Yeah, I mean, obviously shout-outs to Fast50, shout-outs to PlayStation Nation.
[209:20.92]Shout-outs to my amazing community for staying up so late for this run.
[209:24.37]Obviously, there's a bunch of you.
[209:26.71]They are up until like 5, 6, 7 a.m.
[209:29.05]for this.
[209:29.37]So I love you guys so much.
[209:31.21]The rooster just called.
[209:33.05]Yeah.
[209:34.01]The birds are chirping.
[209:36.53]And obviously, shout out to my amazing, wonderful, loving girlfriend, Pepper, who is in the crowd with us today.
[209:42.39]My absolute rock.
[209:43.79]I was a nervous wreck before this, but she sincerely got me through it.
[209:47.47]I love you so much.
[209:48.53]Awesome.
[209:50.85]That's about it.
[209:51.61]That's all the shout outs I have.
[209:53.35]What a run.
[209:54.47]That was phenomenal.
[209:56.65]Well, I nearly just spilled the drink.
[209:58.35]That would have been bad.
[210:00.65]as long as they're taking on the electronic equipment.
[210:03.41]Well, we have a couple donations.
[210:05.46]They're rolling in.
[210:07.26]We have a $50 donation from S2K.
[210:09.40]What an amazing entertainer.
[210:10.44]Probably the most informative and fun speedrun I have ever watched.
[210:13.95]Congrats on the event.
[210:16.11]We've got Seavers with the $10 donation.
[210:17.95]LumiLaura deserves another donation.
[210:21.66]We got $25 from Anonymous, $25 from the Googer.
[210:26.92]We had a $25 donation from Visuals earlier saying, hasn't Point Crow been doing bitch skip for years?
[210:35.04]So thank you very much for that.
[210:37.02]And we got Matt Hatter with a $40 donation.
[210:41.20]Puff Minty with a $10.
[210:42.64]Love Spyro.
[210:43.72]There's so many here.
[210:45.02]So many.
[210:45.59]Thank you guys so much.
[210:46.71]We passed $120,000 during the run.
[210:47.43]Keep those donations coming.
[210:49.65]Fast 50 is not over and it will not be over for quite a while.
[210:53.33]There's a whole other day.
[210:54.09]Yeah.
[210:54.41]There's so much more amazing content to come.
[210:56.75]So keep those donations rolling in.
[210:58.38]And yeah, I just hope everyone enjoys.
[211:00.56]I know I will.
[211:01.24]Hell yeah.
[211:01.80]And we have another speed run coming up.
[211:03.52]That's right.
[211:04.22]We have The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker All Dungeon Speed Run.
[211:09.00]Woo!
[211:10.24]Let's go, Linkus!
[211:12.52]Performed by Linkus7, a resident Zelda legend, actually, I would say.
[211:20.14]Absolutely.
[211:20.82]The man has, at one point, in the Wind Waker speed running community, held every single world record in Wind Waker.
[211:29.59]What?
[211:29.91]At the same time.
[211:31.47]in every category.
[211:32.27]That's going to get a clap.
[211:35.21]It's insane.
[211:35.87]He has an incredible resume.
[211:37.73]And he's ridiculous at the run.
[211:41.36]So I'm excited to see it.
[211:41.96]Wind Waker is a brutal speed game too.
[211:43.78]Like seriously, the level of precision and stamina you need to do some of the stuff in that game is insane.
[211:49.04]So yeah, massive respect.
[211:50.99]Can't wait.
[211:51.51]Really excited for it.
[211:51.99]Can't wait.
[211:55.89]Yeah, he's saying the first trick is incredibly physical.
[211:59.80]That's what Linkus was relaying there.
[212:03.10]Really excited to see it.
[212:04.90]Well, Laura, thank you so much for the run with Spyro.
[212:08.82]Thank you so much.
[212:11.19]Thanks, everybody.
[212:11.81]Fantastic speedrun.
[212:17.05]Speedrunning.
[212:18.77]Do you ever speedrun sometimes?
[212:20.52]Yeah, I speed run breakfast.
[212:22.10]Nice.
[212:22.30]Alright.
[212:22.84]Yeah, sometimes it's like a breakfast burrito.
[212:25.07]Nice.
[212:25.89]It goes real quick.
[212:27.17]Sometimes it's a smoothie.
[212:28.75]Smoothie?
[212:29.19]Yeah.
[212:29.60]Wouldn't you get a brain freeze, though?
[212:32.02]Well, I make the smoothie fast.
[212:33.14]I don't drink it fast.
[212:33.90]Oh, okay.
[212:34.28]Gotcha.
[212:34.50]Gotcha.
[212:34.70]Gotcha.
[212:35.93]What do you like in your typical smoothie?
[212:38.27]Oh, alright.
[212:38.97]Now you can get me going.
[212:40.15]Alright.
[212:41.09]You got frozen mango.
[212:42.45]Okay.
[212:43.41]Some oats.
[212:44.61]Rolled oats.
[212:45.27]Of course.
[212:45.63]You sprinkle them in.
[212:47.33]Oat milk.
[212:49.01]Banana.
[212:49.47]A ripe banana.
[212:51.45]Blend it.
[212:52.46]Oh.
[212:52.88]And drink it.
[212:53.84]Nice.
[212:54.10]Love that.
[212:54.48]Nice.
[212:55.14]Healthy.
[212:55.96]It's delicious.
[212:57.08]Mmm.
[213:01.80]No, no, no.
[213:02.54]Let's keep talking about this.
[213:04.66]Do you like blueberries in there?
[213:06.27]Oh my God.
[213:08.11]Alright.
[213:08.35]Let's talk about blueberries.
[213:10.17]Alright.
[213:11.49]No, no.
[213:11.81]Tell me what you know about blueberries.
[213:13.37]Everything you know.
[213:14.14]I like to eat blueberries just raw, right?
[213:17.12]Just blueberries.
[213:18.46]But I don't like it in anything else.
[213:20.87]Like, at all?
[213:22.01]No.
[213:22.35]Oh, pancakes.
[213:23.05]They slap in pancakes.
[213:24.01]No, 0.0.
[213:24.93]What?
[213:25.95]I'm a weirdo.
[213:26.71]Blueberry muffins?
[213:27.77]No.
[213:29.85]Raw, just wet, cold, out of the container.
[213:33.22]What about, like, frozen?
[213:35.32]There you go.
[213:36.12]They're frozen blueberries.
[213:37.42]Okay.
[213:37.70]Frozen grapes.
[213:38.70]Frozen grapes.
[213:39.28]Oh, they're so good.
[213:40.40]Oh, hell yeah.
[213:41.00]Amazing.
[213:42.04]Amazing.
[213:42.90]Any of the frozen fruits?
[213:43.80]Mmm.
[213:47.46]Strawberries, personally.
[213:48.42]Strawberries.
[213:48.98]Love strawberries.
[213:49.66]Bananas.
[213:50.38]I'll be real.
[213:51.15]Mango.
[213:51.71]There's some insane mango.
[213:53.31]Mango.
[213:55.19]Frozen mangoes in the smoothie.
[213:56.41]Yeah, exactly.
[213:57.29]There you go.
[213:58.74]We have a $50 donation from Anonymous.
[214:00.62]Speedrunner's grand, but also the banter.
[214:02.04]Fucking slapped that run.
[214:03.64]Thank you so much.
[214:05.25]alright I love the banter yeah we love it we love it and uh we're gonna pop on over to the wind waker uh all dungeons uh speed run by linkus linkus uh introduce yourself alright hello can you guys hear me I can hear you okay okay hello everybody my name is link seven today we're gonna be doing a speed run of the legend of the wind waker all dungeons now this is
[214:27.16]Probably the dumbest category I could have suggested.
[214:29.37]It is considered the hardest 3D Zelda category.
[214:34.79]It is going to be a lot of tricks, a lot of frame-perfect tricks, but also it is the most physical, demanding one.
[214:41.58]But that being said, I know we're behind schedule, so I think we should just start, and there will be plenty of time to explain it throughout the run.
[214:46.94]It's a longer run.
[214:47.94]Couple cutscenes, we got it.
[214:48.98]Yeah, exactly.
[214:49.82]So, yeah.
[214:51.93]Alright, is everyone ready?
[214:53.69]Let's go, Linkus!
[214:54.25]Let's go, Linkus!
[214:56.59]Let's start in... Okay, let's start in three, two, one, and go.
[215:02.18]Nice!
[215:04.62]Okay.
[215:05.58]Now, I'm going to have to start explaining a glitch immediately here in the beginning.
[215:09.78]And this is also the only glitch where I'm going to ask for silence.
[215:13.63]Every other trick, you can talk as much as you want.
[215:15.57]Trust me, I don't have a problem with it.
[215:17.19]So...
[215:18.71]Wind Waker is very ocean-focused, so the biggest exploit we want to figure out, and has been one of the biggest dream services the game came out with, was obviously some way to get around the ocean without the boat.
[215:28.74]The boat is very slow, don't want to deal with it.
[215:32.64]Now, there are items we're going to get later on.
[215:34.72]In this game, it's going to be the actual main item, the Wind Waker.
[215:37.10]It's the most broken item in the game, and it will allow for a glitch called Super Swimming.
[215:41.33]However, at the start here, I don't have an item, but if I were to do the casual method, I would have about 30 minutes of tutorials and cutscenes.
[215:49.77]So I'm going to do a glitch called a manual super swim, and it is going to exploit how the game basically calculates Link's speed in the water.
[215:59.29]So when you swim, you're going to get three units of speed,
[216:02.49]But to make it a little bit more realistic, when you turn around for just one frame and it runs at 30 FPS, the game will add a negative speed, three units to be exact, and this is to slow you down.
[216:12.84]Now, that means that if you technically can turn the analog stick around 30 times a second, you can get enormous amounts of speed, but I can't do it as a human.
[216:20.88]So for a long time, we had to do what is known as 200 frame perfect pause buffers in a row to be able to perform this trick.
[216:29.52]It's one of the hardest tricks out of any speedrun.
[216:32.28]Now, recently, I decided that I wanted to be one of the first in the world to do this fully unbuffered.
[216:39.09]So if you do this trick an average of 18 times per second moving your analogs, they can gain speed.
[216:44.19]At home, I would only do it unbuffered.
[216:46.81]I'm going to do a combo of both.
[216:48.43]So here we go.
[216:51.15]Sounds for this, right?
[216:52.67]Yeah.
[217:04.09]Sorry, wait.
[217:05.03]The cable is hitting my controller.
[217:07.04]Sorry.
[217:07.52]You got this.
[217:08.34]Let's go like this.
[217:31.87]Hold on, I can save this.
[217:33.43]So normally at home, I would be able to do this very quickly.
[217:36.22]Now, because this is a marathon run, I'm going to have to do a good amount of pause buffering, and I'm going to have to do this over kind of multiple attempts.
[217:44.42]But we're going to get out of here at the very least.
[217:47.54]Just a very hard trick to do.
[217:54.01]My arm is also very tired.
[217:55.18]I have not got enough sleep.
[217:56.38]So I'm going to have to do some pause buffering.
[217:58.32]I cannot.
[217:59.06]My arm is too tired.
[217:59.76]Okay, so we're going to switch to doing some pause buffering here for a bit.
[218:02.68]You can see I'm swimming backwards right now.
[218:05.04]So now I have to unplug my controller to change my analog stick settings.
[218:10.35]I'm going to explain all of this later.
[218:11.53]Sorry.
[218:11.87]So now I have to pause buffer the game.
[218:14.81]Looking at my speed, I do not have a lot of it.
[218:16.65]I have about 200.
[218:17.33]So...
[218:22.49]I want to probably pause buffer this game about 100 times.
[218:24.69]So like I said, at home I would do this fully unbuffered because that resets.
[218:29.46]So the thing that makes pause buffering so hard in this game is that in Ocarina of Time, for example, if you pause too early, the game will not progress any time.
[218:39.22]In this game, if you pause too early, the game will just eat your input.
[218:42.12]It doesn't register it.
[218:43.28]So that means that every pause has to be frame perfect, and you only gain speed if it's frame perfect.
[218:50.12]So I'm going to keep turning around here and hopefully get the speed.
[218:55.78]And like I said, this is the one trick that's really not marathon safe.
[218:59.58]Okay, my arm is a bit rested, so I'm going to do a risky thing here for the... So I'm going to come back here and I'm going to go back to doing unbuffered for a bit.
[219:13.11]So I have to change my analog stick?
[219:15.23]I have so many questions, but I don't want to linger on.
[219:17.04]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[219:17.68]I'm going to explain all of this.
[219:18.76]I'm sorry.
[219:19.22]This is so cool, Linkus.
[219:20.28]This is so cool.
[219:37.95]That's a good amount of speed.
[219:42.06]Okay, so now we should have less pause buffers to do.
[219:45.86]And yeah, if this was done perfectly at home, I can literally get all of the speed in about 40 seconds of doing that analog stick trick.
[219:52.71]But I'm pretty close now, so we shouldn't have to pause buffer for that long.
[220:02.40]And I promise, this is the only time I'm doing this trick, by the way.
[220:04.38]It's only the start that is this brutal.
[220:06.70]This is so cool, Ligas, you got it.
[220:15.64]I think I have enough speed.
[220:34.53]I'm going to try something right now.
[220:37.73]Not enough speed.
[221:01.94]I'm going to go to the other side.
[221:18.89]Okay, so now I just have to hit the beat to get an air refill.
[221:21.41]Hold on, hold on a second.
[221:22.33]I can still lose this.
[221:23.15]Hold on.
[221:23.93]So I'm going to be able to talk in a second.
[221:25.62]Sorry.
[221:27.00]So now I have to get hit an air refill without hitting the island or I lose all of my speed.
[221:32.26]So I have to go here.
[221:35.81]Shards in place here.
[221:51.19]Are you winning son?
[221:54.91]I'm sorry that took an extra minute or two compared to what it usually be.
[221:58.21]But anyway, so that is Manual Super Swim.
[222:03.22]So that skips about 30 minutes of dialog and cutscenes.
[222:06.18]This game was thought to be tasked only for over 10 years because
[222:09.28]Who would rather be mad enough to flick an analog stick, because if you do 15 times per second, your net speed to gain zero is like at zero, because it's plus, the math would be plus three, minus three, plus three, minus three.
[222:20.19]So to gain any speed on buffer, you have to do minimum 16 per second on analog stick, or pause buffer to gain 200 times frame perfectly.
[222:27.59]So we knew it for about 10 years before anyone wanted to try it.
[222:31.96]And now it's implemented.
[222:33.10]And even though the first trick sucks to learn, once you do that, the entire run becomes fun, and there's going to be a lot of sequence breaking.
[222:41.04]But yeah, basically, to summarize the trick, and I think people behind me as well might have some questions, but I basically just got 600 units of speed by pause buffering up and down.
[222:52.73]Once I hit that speed...
[222:54.93]I move so quickly that the game cannot keep up with the character.
[222:59.39]So what happens is I am in the middle of the screen, and on the next frame, I am behind the camera.
[223:04.46]The game panics and goes, oh, no, Link is not supposed to be off camera.
[223:07.60]Flip the camera 180 degrees.
[223:09.88]But because I have the speed, it will continuously do that repeatedly, and it will basically automatically let me charge up my speed.
[223:19.36]And now we are at Dragon Roost, and even though I could lose time, I never have to do the trick anymore because the Wind Waker is the glitch that we use to do that.
[223:29.13]There are so many glitches in this run that I'm going to kind of explain them throughout it to not overwhelm you in the first 30 minutes.
[223:36.34]But until we get into all the other glitches, do all of you guys have any questions?
[223:42.66]Where do we start?
[223:43.34]Yes, Professor.
[223:44.12]A few.
[223:46.42]Yeah.
[223:47.18]What the hell?
[223:48.00]It's my first.
[223:50.36]I have to enter Beetle quickly.
[223:51.92]That's not a question.
[223:56.67]Okay.
[223:56.93]I have a question.
[223:58.79]Yeah.
[223:59.41]What's fascinating about speedrunning to me is how you figure that out.
[224:05.87]How do you know to do that?
[224:07.93]Who finds out those things?
[224:11.39]So it was all discovered by accident.
[224:14.69]So a glitch was discovered by accident called storage.
[224:17.74]I'm going to do it a lot in this run, but you know what?
[224:20.66]I'll take a quick five second time loss right now and just show you so you get an idea.
[224:25.02]So remember how you understand the fundamental basics, Chad, and everyone at home that's watching and everyone behind me that the idea is if you turn around every frame, you gain speed.
[224:34.93]That's all you need to know to understand the trick.
[224:37.11]Now, the Wind Waker is a special item.
[224:39.24]As you can see, even if I'm facing away, if I take it out, it will always face the front of Link.
[224:43.38]It's called Camera Lock, that's how the game is programmed.
[224:45.59]So by doing this glitch called Store, it's right here, it's frame perfect.
[224:49.95]What it lets me to do is basically have control over Link in a mode I'm not supposed to, like this.
[224:56.13]And what people discovered because they found this by accident was, hey, if you do that glitch and go in the water and hold up, Link turns around very fast.
[225:04.55]Not only that, but if you keep holding up and release the analog stick, you fly away.
[225:11.20]Why does that happen?
[225:12.24]And then research went into it and they realized it's kind of like Mario 64's backwards long jumps.
[225:21.03]Wait, okay, sorry, where did you go?
[225:22.55]Yeah, sorry, so... Lucas, this is so cool.
[225:30.07]I need to do a... I need to get a cutscene right here.
[225:33.61]I did a wrong order or something, so I'm actually unfortunately losing time here.
[225:38.33]So I needed to undo a glitch.
[225:39.53]So there's a cutscene here to learn Wind's Requiem.
[225:42.31]It's the wind song for this game.
[225:44.85]And normally you get a long cutscene on it.
[225:47.29]Sorry, I'm swimming around.
[225:47.99]I need to get the beetle to a loading zone again.
[225:52.04]But anyways, so to change the wind direction in Wind Waker, you need to get Wind's Requiem, otherwise it's impossible to change the wind direction.
[226:01.38]And you get a really long cutscene of a tutorial, but there's a special trick you can do to basically skip that entirely.
[226:07.09]And that's what I am doing right now.
[226:09.43]But I quickly need to reset the stone because it was glitched.
[226:12.73]I'm a little bit worried.
[226:15.71]I have never had that happen, actually, that the left stone went invisible.
[226:20.10]But I think with a second reload, I should be able to get the song.
[226:23.02]World's first.
[226:23.50]Because it is not in my inventory, so it shouldn't have activated the flag.
[226:28.54]Worst case, this is a first-time discovery, and I get to redo that first glitch.
[226:31.98]So let's hope I don't.
[226:32.92]That's all I'm going to say.
[226:35.34]But after that, it's going to be smooth sailing.
[226:37.04]Do we have some time for some donations?
[226:39.14]Yeah.
[226:39.93]We have a $69 donation by Nice.
[226:42.33]Nice.
[226:43.57]Did they just say Nice?
[226:46.05]I like that.
[226:46.61]Nice.
[226:47.41]Nice.
[226:48.63]We got a lot of donations, all saying Pazza.
[226:53.12]Yes.
[226:54.64]In the HD version, you play on Italian instead, so you get a beautiful Pazza text, so it is a long-term meme that that is Pazza.
[227:01.24]Okay, we got the cutscene.
[227:02.58]I'm going to let myself watch it.
[227:03.58]It's a 30-second time loss, but it will be slower to get the cutscene skipped now.
[227:10.01]But anyways.
[227:12.85]After I get this cutscene and we get Wind Shrek, we'll be starting the run.
[227:17.74]The glitches are not going to stop.
[227:18.98]So I'm going to explain everything, but the beautiful thing is there is only a couple of glitches and they're done in alternate ways, if that makes sense.
[227:27.01]So once I've explained it once, you will understand the fundamentals of the run.
[227:30.75]So there's going to be a lot of time for questions and a lot of time for donations throughout this.
[227:35.31]But like I said, very dense at the beginning.
[227:37.35]So once I have this wind song now, my objective is to basically go back to the technically portion of the intro.
[227:45.60]So the first thing I need to do is be able to super swim.
[227:48.38]So I'm now going to finally get back to super swimming with my Wind Baker.
[227:52.51]So by holding up in the water here, Link will turn around every single frame, and he will basically do what I did earlier, but automatically.
[227:59.16]So I don't have to pause buffer.
[228:00.34]Oh my god.
[228:01.20]I'll never get used to this.
[228:03.10]This is awesome.
[228:03.76]This is such a cool run.
[228:06.22]So what I'm going to try and do here is I'm going to super swim over to a submarine.
[228:11.09]Now, this submarine has absolutely nothing in it.
[228:13.21]It is just like I think casually it has let me think it has a treasure truck.
[228:18.67]However, what we want specifically is a model with a lantern.
[228:23.49]So normally if you played Wind Waker, you would go through outside, you would get the cut scenes, and then you would get to the first kind of dungeon area, Forsaken Fortress 1.
[228:30.59]Now, this place is kind of a sneaking around with guards trying to catch it all the time.
[228:36.83]And the objective is to get to the end, see your sister, and get your sword back, which you don't have.
[228:41.93]However, if I go in this random submarine in the overworld, and I go in front of them, they will not act as an enemy, they will act as a guard, and they will wrong-warp me from the submarine into Forsaken Fortress 1.
[228:54.58]Woo!
[228:55.54]Wow!
[228:56.94]Wow.
[228:57.54]That's crazy tech.
[228:59.02]And that is a really clever way Nintendo, Nintendo in this generation tried to do a lot of strategies to try and optimize how much disk space was being used.
[229:06.35]So instead of making two enemies that had two properties, one that is a guard and one that is an enemy, they just said, let's make one and have a flag in the game.
[229:13.76]If Link, the player, has a sword, it will act as an enemy.
[229:17.58]If he doesn't, we should act as a guard.
[229:20.34]Because normally, casually, we'd never not have a sword, except for the first five minutes of the game, or we need temporary elusive in Forsaken Fortress here.
[229:29.10]However, thanks to sequence breaking, I can have it in the overworld, so that is what let me get here.
[229:34.51]Thankfully, even though I never got the sword and lost it here, it's still always placed out here, so I can get through Forsaken Fortress normally.
[229:43.49]So there's a few things I want here.
[229:44.89]I want to get the Gossip Stone, which is an item that's important for later, the sword, and also by beating this, King of Red Lions, the actual boat, will spawn into the overworld, and that's very important.
[229:56.98]So I'm going to try and do a precise cycle here, but I only have one try at the Frame Perfect Storage and see if I can get it.
[230:03.39]nice so nice what what so now um I'm going to jump into this gossip stone trigger and that has actually activated a cut scene and it's supposed to play but it didn't so I got the item but I didn't have to watch the cut scene uh then I roll around these lanterns and I got some rupees I got the item I needed and now we're ready to go on um
[230:29.02]Now, I know this is very overwhelming, but it's going to be more overwhelming.
[230:34.64]Thank you.
[230:35.28]Great, great.
[230:36.38]That was just the syllabus.
[230:37.74]Exactly.
[230:39.91]There will be a quiz on this.
[230:41.05]So the super swim glitch, you remember how I explained that it basically just means you can walk around in a mode you're not supposed to.
[230:47.53]So I'm going to use that storage glitch again, but this time on a chest.
[230:51.43]So I'm going to get storage here.
[230:52.63]So frame perfectly, dive off, cancel three frames before.
[230:55.46]Now, if you're trying to open up this chest...
[230:57.22]It will open for one frame and fail.
[230:59.44]Why is that important?
[231:00.88]Well, when you do the opening chest animation, Link kind of leans forward and tries to grab the item, but he can't because his collision is just so thick.
[231:08.44]So what Nintendo did is they basically shrunk the hitbox during the animation so you can perform the animation, and then it returns you back to normal.
[231:16.32]But since I canceled it, I now have this tiny hitbox, meaning that I can do some unintended things.
[231:23.56]So let's just say that walls are now officially a suggestion.
[231:28.77]And if you pay very close attention to the audio here when I open up this door, you're going to hear something very important.
[231:38.52]Nintendo pays me for my glitch.
[231:43.15]Whatever you store in a chest is added to your inventory once you go through a loading zone.
[231:48.37]That's when it can add it since you can't add it while you're playing.
[231:51.12]Right here, I'm going to abuse a really cool fact.
[231:54.20]These guards have a really huge dome to try and spot you.
[231:57.62]when you're walking around.
[231:58.88]But they wanted to prevent castles from sneaking around in that barrel and then put off the barrel and immediately get spotted.
[232:04.69]So they temporarily shrink your hitbox for about five seconds after you put that barrel down.
[232:09.91]But instead of sneaking around, I just pick it up, drop it to get a temporarily lower hitbox.
[232:14.70]I go around and now I can sidle and I'm at the basically end of Forsaken Fortress.
[232:20.52]So I have a break from glitches.
[232:25.51]We're finally having a breather.
[232:27.57]That was a very intense first 15, 20 minutes.
[232:30.11]I don't think I've been breathing.
[232:33.33]I have a donation I think you'd really like to hear.
[232:36.03]It's... That's my goat.
[232:39.39]Oh, yeah, baby.
[232:40.39]Hi, Linkus.
[232:41.82]It's me, Maisie.
[232:42.76]I used your credit card for this.
[232:45.54]Thank you for donating $25 to charity.
[232:48.66]Maybe it wasn't so good to share finances.
[232:52.43]In case you don't know, Maisie is Lingus's wife.
[232:55.93]Yes.
[232:57.19]Love you, Maisie.
[232:59.96]But anyways, so... That's the end of Forsaken Fortress.
[233:03.50]We got our sword.
[233:04.20]We're gonna get some cutscenes.
[233:05.56]So, before we get into anything else, I think instead of just over-explaining everything, I'm gonna ask the couch, because I think I take a lot of things for granted.
[233:14.93]I've been spearing this friend since, you know, 2016 now.
[233:18.33]Is there any concept that you're confused about?
[233:22.62]Is there any concept that I understand?
[233:27.16]So physics.
[233:28.48]Yeah.
[233:29.00]I feel like we need to start with that.
[233:30.53]Just like the concept of it.
[233:32.01]Sure.
[233:32.31]So, okay.
[233:33.43]I will give, for anyone who's a windbreaker on here, don't get upset.
[233:36.51]I'm going to simplify this.
[233:37.55]If I go technical...
[233:39.56]Nothing will make sense.
[233:41.04]So imagine that anytime this game wants to control Link, right?
[233:44.94]You have two states.
[233:46.16]You have state zero.
[233:47.32]This would just be a playable state.
[233:48.36]You're playing around, you're doing everything normally.
[233:50.50]And then you would have state one.
[233:51.76]This is anything that's restricted.
[233:53.56]And you might not think about this, but it restricts you in a lot of ways.
[233:56.14]Let's say you're talking to an NPC.
[233:57.78]You can only press A. You can't walk around.
[233:59.47]Let's say you take out a Wind Waker.
[234:01.17]You can use the C-Stick to play.
[234:03.63]Opening up a chest, opening up a door, anything.
[234:05.81]Anything like that restricts you.
[234:07.99]And how the game's math works, in this simplified explanation, is any time you start an interaction, for example, opening up a chest, etc., it will add 1 to this value.
[234:19.01]So it will go from playable state to, oh, this is restricted.
[234:22.49]Once you press A or B to leave whatever puts you in this mode, it will go, oh, minus 1.
[234:28.22]Put him back to 0.
[234:29.74]And you would never notice this if you were playing the game casually.
[234:32.68]But with that Wind Waker dive glitch I do, where I climb up a ledge, I take out the Wind Waker, and I cancel it exactly three frames before I land, something very interesting happens.
[234:43.41]I press B to cancel the Wind Waker, but exactly right before you land on the ground, Link tries to do an animation of bending his legs to prepare for the fall.
[234:53.81]And if this happens at the same time, the game will exit the Wind Waker, but still have it out.
[235:00.32]And remember this example I explained earlier?
[235:02.26]That would mean that I took out the Wind Waker, I'm in a restricted state, I'm in one.
[235:06.34]I press B to cancel it, I'm not back at zero.
[235:08.90]But because I still have the Wind Waker out, I can press B a second time.
[235:14.07]And now I am at negative one.
[235:16.75]And this is where all the glitches come into play.
[235:19.49]Because that's why it's called storage.
[235:21.37]I am storing a restricted state for the future.
[235:24.89]If I take out the Wind Waker, it should restrict me, that's plus one.
[235:28.53]But since I'm at negative one, I will stay in a playable state.
[235:31.91]I try and open up a chest, still playable state.
[235:34.95]Text, cutscene, anything like that, it will work.
[235:38.81]And all the glitch quirks that you will see throughout this run are all abusing how each one of those restricted states are built.
[235:47.57]So remember earlier I explained that the Wind Waker, you have to face Link.
[235:50.77]It's called camera lock.
[235:51.70]The camera is locked behind Link, right?
[235:53.52]Like I'm staring at you.
[235:54.64]I can't stare away.
[235:55.54]I can't look at those guys, right?
[235:56.68]That's what Link is doing.
[235:58.46]So if I'm trying to turn around in the water, I can't stop facing you.
[236:02.54]So you are going to have to turn around 180 degrees over there and you're going to see the back instead, right?
[236:06.51]And that's how the camera works.
[236:08.07]So that makes me turn around every frame.
[236:10.05]I get speed.
[236:10.61]I get backwards momentum.
[236:12.19]I try and open up a chest.
[236:13.83]It starts to test and goes, no, no, no.
[236:15.37]He's supposed to be able to still play.
[236:16.95]We can't restrict the state.
[236:18.70]and then I get the properties of how that cutscene was built.
[236:21.92]And that's how all glitches in as simple of a way as I can explain are fundamentally based upon.
[236:29.46]I can't believe you just described every single glitch in Wind Waker in a couple sentences.
[236:34.74]You're crazy for that.
[236:35.82]You're insane.
[236:36.62]Do you think any devs just kind of sit around and they have a cigar, smoke it, and they just like make a big puff like, you did good, kid.
[236:45.44]You did good.
[236:46.12]You having fun, son?
[236:47.44]Yeah.
[236:47.72]Just like you figured it out.
[236:49.40]Alright.
[236:50.18]You did good.
[236:51.70]I think you guys can notice at this point, I'm very passionate about this game.
[236:55.12]I love this game, okay?
[236:57.42]This game holds a very... Do you ever play some Hard of Think?
[237:01.89]Man, my English is failing.
[237:02.93]Sploosh Kaboom or Wind Waker?
[237:04.31]Wind Waker.
[237:04.91]Yeah, we're not playing Sink the Battleship right now.
[237:09.07]Again, right now when I'm at Windfall, everything looks pretty normal and it will be for about the next one minute.
[237:15.57]So...
[237:16.85]I'm going to buy the sail, and this is kind of what I'm intended to do.
[237:21.07]But once I have the sail, so I technically can get around with the boat if I need to, the glitches are going to start.
[237:27.75]I'm going to make a safety save right here, because if I fail this trick, my game will either softlock or I'll lose two minutes, so in case of the softlock, I'm going to save.
[237:40.05]I'm going to get storage right here.
[237:41.73]Once again, all of these storages are frame perfect.
[237:44.53]I'm going to take the text box from King of Red Lions.
[237:48.17]So are you in a negative state or a positive state right now?
[237:51.02]So I was negative.
[237:51.96]I talked to King of Red Lions, and it was used up.
[237:54.94]You can actually see right now the text is on the screen, but I can play.
[238:01.32]So what I'm going to do now is for speed, I'm going to have the text box up while I'm getting the storage glitch.
[238:09.26]At this point, what I want to do is I want to activate an event called Endless Night.
[238:14.43]In Wind Waker, normally you could only get bombs after beating the first two dungeons.
[238:18.35]And the way they restrict you from doing that is by going to Great Fish Island.
[238:22.49]Now, Great Fish Island has a very long cutscene, and there's a lot of things I don't want to deal with.
[238:27.19]So what I have to do right here, and this can very easily fail, this is one of the harder glitches, I have to drown at the same... And while I am drowning, the cutscene has to play...
[238:41.45]Maybe, let's see.
[238:44.07]I got it.
[238:44.47]Beautiful.
[238:46.45]So you can't even see it, but while I'm drowning, at literally the last split second, I have to get close enough to the island for the cutscene to start.
[238:53.64]And you can now see that we're having a rainy day.
[238:55.68]We're clearly no longer in LA.
[238:57.88]It's just going to be raining like crazy.
[238:59.66]And this changes a ton of things around the game.
[239:02.46]More specifically, what I'm interested in is that this boat right here, this pirate ship is spawned in.
[239:08.26]And this was not supposed to spawn until way later in the game.
[239:11.80]but it contains the bombs.
[239:13.46]And getting bombs early is one of the most broken items in the game, so it's very important for this run that I get this bow to spawn.
[239:20.75]Now, I would normally do a slightly different route here, but because it is completely RNG-based, I'm gonna quickly get some rupees here instead for marathon safety.
[239:32.90]And after getting some rupees, we're gonna go and save Tingle to get the Tingle Tuner, which is gonna be a very important item for the run.
[239:43.64]If you don't see, by the way, this run requires the use of a Game Boy Advance at the same time, so I have one laying in front of me.
[239:50.63]What?
[239:51.11]Wait, what?
[239:52.21]I'm sorry, what?
[239:53.33]I'm going to use my nose to navigate the Game Boy Advance while I'm playing for certain glitches to be able to get through certain aspects.
[240:00.44]I just want to highlight this.
[240:01.60]You use your nose?
[240:03.34]Yes.
[240:04.14]That's also why I used the old advanced model instead of an SP model, because the SP has firmer buttons, so my nose couldn't hit them properly.
[240:10.85]So I downgraded to this model so that the buttons are higher up.
[240:15.22]What the hell?
[240:16.24]I gotta ask, is this the first speedrun where you use your nose?
[240:21.32]I can't think of another one.
[240:22.56]Like, I've heard of speedruns where you use your feet.
[240:24.71]Sure.
[240:25.01]But, like, nose?
[240:26.57]That's... Oh, my God.
[240:29.27]We have a ton of big donations, by the way.
[240:31.09]Sounds good.
[240:31.51]I have to change my controller for one second at the end of the text box so you can... Actually, wait.
[240:35.54]We're coming up with another new glitch.
[240:37.74]Go for it.
[240:38.28]Go for it.
[240:39.32]You can do it.
[240:39.90]Hey, you're the speedrunner.
[240:43.10]Yeah, sorry, normally I have it on my desk.
[240:45.54]But yeah, I don't want to do that first glitch with the analog stick on a good controller, because it absolutely destroys it, I'm sure you can imagine.
[240:53.91]But you have a separate controller for this glitch.
[240:56.25]Yeah.
[240:57.44]So here, I want to get in this pirate ship, but there's a password here and I can't get in.
[241:04.36]Now, I'm going to show you right now.
[241:05.40]Do you see how technically if I grab up right here, the ledge is partially inside of Link?
[241:09.40]So what the game will do is it will push me out on the first frame.
[241:12.16]What that means, however, is if I climb up and I roll to the left on the very first frame, I will clip out of bounds.
[241:20.19]Once I'm out of bounds, I can walk through this railing.
[241:22.73]Oops, frame early.
[241:24.55]I can walk through this railing.
[241:28.55]and get to the very edge here, and side up straight into the loading zone, skipping a three-minute cutscene.
[241:33.90]Oh my god.
[241:34.66]Wow.
[241:35.08]Wow!
[241:38.03]just to confirm right this game runs at 30 frames per second correct yes so every time you say frame perfect you are doing a one thirtieth of a second like input yes uh yeah there is a lot of frame perfect inputs in this game so anytime you see me do storage which I do over 100 times it's a three frame window to get the dive and a frame perfect input to cancel it every single time
[242:00.96]Every time I do a roll clip, it's going to be frame perfect.
[242:03.14]I don't think there's any glitches really that aren't frame perfect.
[242:06.46]There's going to be a lot.
[242:08.98]There's a reason I always jokingly say that I only got about a year into me to do this game.
[242:13.05]Because even only at the age of 25, my hands can only do this about every other to third day because it is intense.
[242:20.31]And trust me when I say we're not done with the intense tricks in terms of physical activities.
[242:26.03]I can't wait.
[242:26.64]That's like a starting pitcher at a major league baseball team.
[242:29.10]Yeah.
[242:30.30]I just want to sign this man.
[242:31.36]Gotta get the three, four days of rest.
[242:33.36]Yeah, exactly.
[242:36.22]We have a $25 donation from Abby Bagel.
[242:38.76]Linkus is the GOAT.
[242:40.36]He super swam into our hearts and our wallets.
[242:44.47]125K soon to go.
[242:46.59]Let's go.
[242:47.03]Let's get it.
[242:47.81]Very nice.
[242:49.39]We have a $100 donation from Anonymous.
[242:53.40]Let's go, Linkus.
[242:54.72]Thank you.
[242:55.72]We have a $150 donation from Osmars.
[242:59.82]Alright.
[243:00.86]Hello, Osmars here.
[243:01.56]On behalf of Linkus' community, we are so proud of him for showing off this run for everyone here today.
[243:05.28]This is one of my all-time favorite speedrunners and speedrunner, and I'm very excited to have everyone see it.
[243:09.73]Go, Charity!
[243:11.15]Yeah, go, Charity!
[243:15.44]I think you have time for one more while I'm doing stuff uh we have a 25 donation from cheese man let's go lingus my number one road rage streamer I never get mad what do you mean I would never do that the way that you're doing that super swim you know I I'm fearful if you were gonna get into a car
[243:36.44]I'm only verbal on the road.
[243:37.96]I never do something physical.
[243:42.29]So right now, I'm connecting my Game Boy Advance to my console through a linking cable.
[243:47.67]So this is basically kind of a, honestly, like Wii U gamepad function on the GameCube.
[243:52.93]It's really cool.
[243:53.77]So casually, what you would use this for is that you get a live updating map.
[243:58.27]And if you've ever played Wind Waker, you will know that when you want to salvage the treasures,
[244:01.52]You go a little bit too far, a little bit too short, it's terrible.
[244:03.88]So the live-up title map is very useful.
[244:05.90]But what I am more interested in is the fact that Tingle, I mean, he's greedy after all, has a shop.
[244:12.67]It's very overpriced, but unlike items where I have to physically use it, I can use the shop at any time in the run.
[244:23.62]And that is going to be very useful.
[244:26.50]Um...
[244:27.63]So right here, I did a special storage trick.
[244:32.89]Simply put, it lets me superswim while I can still skip cutscenes.
[244:39.09]Normally you can't.
[244:40.39]And that's just because otherwise I'd softlock my game at Forest Haven.
[244:43.84]So I'm going to superswim all the way here.
[244:47.30]Also, to not lose speed, do you see how Link is kind of swimming downwards throughout this entire thing?
[244:51.78]I have to hold a tiny bit down outside of the dead zone.
[244:56.38]Not too much, because I lose too much speed, and if it's too little, my run or my Super Sim fails.
[245:01.04]So it's very precise to control this glitch.
[245:04.18]But now we are at Forest Haven, and while we are here, we're now coming up on my favorite glitch in the game.
[245:11.12]So this next glitch that's coming up here is called a Zombie Hover.
[245:17.09]The zombie hunters, from what I've seen, are crazy.
[245:22.22]Yes, they are quite ridiculous.
[245:25.34]Several frame-perfect inputs, is it?
[245:27.96]Yeah, I have to mash my B button 15 times per second.
[245:33.02]So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first actually... Let me think.
[245:37.78]I'm going to first actually save my game here.
[245:43.57]Let's not, you know, have to reset the run if I fail this, because I would have to redo this if I failed the next glitch, so... So you're taking this damage on purpose?
[245:52.49]Yeah, so I'm taking this damage on purpose, so I think to make it more entertaining for y'all, I'm going to show the glitch off, and then I'll explain it afterwards.
[246:04.92]So... All I have to say is enjoy, so...
[246:10.39]Let's hopefully be able to get this first try, so... This is how the glitch looks like.
[246:21.73]He rises from the dead!
[246:24.27]Oh my god!
[246:25.89]And do you remember how I connected my Game Boy Advance earlier?
[246:28.97]Sorry, I'm going to have a little bit of a weird voice.
[246:30.38]I'm going to turn this thing up.
[246:31.52]So basically, if I land on the ground right now, I'm going to die.
[246:35.28]However, thankfully, I have my nose.
[246:38.26]So I'm going to purchase an item right now.
[246:41.21]That's the Game Boy Advance.
[246:43.51]And this is a red potion.
[246:47.13]So you can see that it's currently ticking in, it's loading, and once it sends it over, it's going to take 20 rupees, heal me, and I'm at the top.
[246:55.46]Wow!
[246:57.50]That's crazy!
[247:00.10]Now, this next glitch coming up is very precise, and if I fail this, I'm going to have to redo all that.
[247:05.34]But honestly, it's a cool glitch, so it's fine.
[247:06.66]I'd love to see it again.
[247:07.58]Yeah, so...
[247:09.68]Honestly, I'm not going to bother explaining this.
[247:11.92]This glitch will literally take me 15 minutes to explain.
[247:14.72]I'm going to get crushed in the same frame that I complete this cutscene.
[247:19.65]So, the previous glitch...
[247:22.26]Nintendo realized when they were developing this game that, hey, when you stand up and you have zero HP, there's a very short amount of time where you can perform an input before the game over screen starts.
[247:35.04]So to avoid it to do anything, Nintendo thought they were clever by saying, okay, if the player performs any inputs, we are going to cancel the interaction.
[247:43.74]But that actually is the only reason that glitch works, because every time you jump slash, you gain height.
[247:49.28]So by mashing jump slashes every other frame, so 15 times per second, I will gain more and more height, and that is how I'm able to get up.
[247:57.97]Now, I will need to count here, so just one second.
[248:01.69]Basically, these shoes, I turn off their AI with a complicated glitch.
[248:05.11]They're just going forward right now.
[248:06.99]And what I want to do is push this guy out of bounds.
[248:09.49]He will go out of bounds so far he despawns.
[248:12.45]At the same time that happens, I'm going to get crushed by the giant Giga Chat Shin of that Deku Tree.
[248:18.10]And if I do that at the same time, at the exact same time, the cutscene will be skipped, and we are actually safe from all the, like, really bad glitches for a while.
[248:27.02]So, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[248:38.83]Elise, if I spawn at the top, it worked?
[248:44.36]We're good.
[248:45.04]Okay.
[248:47.38]Okay.
[248:48.30]Holy shit.
[248:50.04]Dude.
[248:51.39]What?
[248:51.93]This is crazy.
[248:54.39]This is some really cool stuff.
[248:56.45]Yeah.
[248:57.78]What incredible speed practice.
[248:59.31]The honest thing is, the thing that sucks about this in a marathon run is I think it looks very impressive.
[249:03.49]Unfortunately, even if I just talk for the full, you know, two and a half, three hours of this run, I don't think you'd understand it all.
[249:10.22]It's just too much.
[249:11.58]So, it almost would need like a documentary to explain everything that's happening.
[249:16.82]I think I speak for everyone here when I say that you should make a video fully explaining all of this as a documentary.
[249:23.53]It would be incredibly entertaining.
[249:25.13]I will be sad.
[249:26.49]I will remove anything I have during those couple days to watch it.
[249:32.41]It would be cool.
[249:34.78]We did get a $300 donation from Librarian saying, my favorite Hitman horse.
[249:46.64]Link is also Speedrun's Hitman.
[249:50.95]Fantastic at the game, too.
[249:53.75]Sorry, I needed to listen to the speaker on my Game Boy Advance here, so right now I'm using the Tingle Tuner.
[250:00.15]So, you know how there's Hoverboots in Ocarina of Time?
[250:02.91]There actually exists the Hoverboots in Wind Waker.
[250:05.03]Unfortunately, it's locked behind a paywall, and it costs 30 rupees on top of that to buy it for Tingle for five seconds.
[250:12.40]But it lets me skip this entire thing and fly right to the end, which normally wouldn't be possible.
[250:18.06]Wow.
[250:18.14]And we are now in Forsaken...
[250:21.21]Forbidden Woods, the technical second dungeon.
[250:23.98]But this is the first dungeon we're doing for the speedrun.
[250:26.06]Yep.
[250:27.70]And normally this would not be very feasible to beat without too many items.
[250:31.47]Thankfully, I got bombed, Surly.
[250:33.97]And this entire puzzle of the dungeon is basically you have these eyes, you have the damage, and then halfway through you get the boomerang, and that's their weakness.
[250:42.56]But the bombs, which is a later game item, can just damage all of them.
[250:46.50]So I don't really have to deal with any of that.
[250:49.44]So I can just kind of get through this.
[250:51.04]Now, I got to ask, is this possible without the bombs?
[250:55.64]Like, getting through this dungeon?
[250:57.32]If I were to skip the first dungeon but not have bombs?
[251:00.56]Yes.
[251:03.42]Yes.
[251:04.66]With other glitches.
[251:06.04]Crazy.
[251:06.62]Insane.
[251:07.12]I can't even fathom that.
[251:09.89]Yeah, the old route of 100% that I used to run actually was really cool because you didn't get the sword until over an hour into the run.
[251:18.57]So that one was a crazy route, having to go through everything without a sword too.
[251:21.87]It's almost like you were doing modded, but you were just doing glitches.
[251:25.56]I really do want to highlight this fact as well.
[251:27.52]We said it during the intro of the actual game when introducing Lingus, but Lingus has held a world record in every single category of Wind Waker.
[251:36.32]And not only that, but he's done it simultaneously, where every single top of the leaderboard was him.
[251:43.33]So he knows his stuff.
[251:44.55]He knows pretty much every route in the game.
[251:46.87]He's kind of crazy with it.
[251:50.47]He also walks up tree stops.
[251:52.97]Yeah, sorry, chest storage.
[251:55.60]Yeah, I had a childhood dream of mine to play this game for a living.
[252:02.80]And, you know, my dad was as supportive as you can be when you have a little kid saying, I want to play video games for a living.
[252:10.16]So in 2016, I picked up Wind Waker HD basically almost full time.
[252:15.67]And once I graduated, I basically asked him, hey, could you give me one year to see if I can make it as a streamer?
[252:26.32]And if I can't, I will get a normal job.
[252:28.32]And he agreed to that and helped me out financially.
[252:31.56]And on month 12, I was featured on Front Page and was able to make it.
[252:36.98]So it's all thanks to being on Front Page in that last month that I've been here ever since.
[252:44.33]And yeah, I haven't basically almost not taken a break from this game since then.
[252:48.61]I've switched from HD to GameCube.
[252:51.51]I'm trying to get through a record in this category right now.
[252:53.48]I'm sorry.
[252:57.14]It's almost like the game is supposed to operate that way.
[252:58.92]Yeah, it's like, oh, you just clipped through the door, you know?
[253:01.48]Did you not play that way?
[253:03.06]Yeah, so remember earlier I said the game shrinks your hitbox and that's how I walk up steep slopes?
[253:07.75]There is a perfect demonstration.
[253:08.97]Nintendo accidentally left like a pixel of room in between the door and the wall, but since I'm a hitbox, this is how small I can run through.
[253:15.04]Now here I'm in big trouble.
[253:16.48]I can't cut this guy down.
[253:17.54]I don't have the boomerang.
[253:19.76]Thankfully, this guy has terrible collision underneath because it's not supposed to.
[253:24.49]So just to give a demonstration, if you were to look right now, you're going to see that if I throw this bomb perfectly, I'll just clip inside.
[253:30.68]So by perfectly timing four bomb throws, and they're pretty precise here...
[253:37.69]Two.
[253:39.25]I will hopefully be able to take him down very quickly here.
[253:44.54]So that's three.
[253:45.62]And stop moving.
[253:46.40]Stop moving.
[253:46.98]Good.
[253:47.28]Four.
[253:47.94]Alright.
[253:48.58]Wow.
[253:49.56]Wow.
[253:50.08]Oh, my God.
[253:53.13]And you can see the game is not too happy with it.
[253:54.99]He's still in the air.
[253:55.77]He's not supposed to be there when you defeat him, but it works.
[253:59.94]A little fun fact, though, when you're up here.
[254:02.40]So there is a luck-based chance when you're doing PV or record attempts that this run just flat out dies right here because he's going to have to do a jump instead of walk into Makar right here.
[254:12.72]And you see how the heart is right next to Makar?
[254:15.06]There is a chance that he lands on that heart and your run just dead.
[254:19.80]So it's very annoying of a heart piece.
[254:22.18]It has happened too many times.
[254:23.88]That was crazy.
[254:25.30]Wow.
[254:26.02]I've had my mouth open this whole time.
[254:28.49]I'm aghast.
[254:29.39]Like a two-year-old that saw the Teletubbies for the first time.
[254:32.29]It's the sun.
[254:33.31]Holy shit.
[254:34.19]Why is the sun a baby?
[254:35.87]Me and Jorma talked earlier today, and he said, like, you know, you've got to find, like, that thing you're super passionate about.
[254:40.73]I'm sure he can notice now, this is the thing.
[254:43.11]Right.
[254:43.97]This is the thing.
[254:46.19]Well, you're pretty damn good at it.
[254:48.31]Thank you.
[254:50.07]Um, but yeah, anyways, we have a cutscene here, and the nice thing too is gonna be, this is gonna be still very glitch heavy and still a lot of explanation, but, um, you know, I'm gonna do way more zombie hovers later on, storage is super swim, but the nice thing is now we're past the first 30 minutes of just pure non-stop explanations.
[255:09.16]There's gonna be less fewer tricks and more variations of things we've seen, so if you've understood at least half of what I've said, you should be good.
[255:18.14]You're great at explaining it.
[255:20.00]There's something during this cutscene, if I recall, that your Twitch chat loves to do.
[255:25.87]Can you explain that a little bit?
[255:27.93]Of course, yeah.
[255:28.53]So we're going to get an orchestra right here with Makar, a little baby.
[255:31.55]You can actually see I got the little Korok shirt right here, too.
[255:34.89]So everyone in the back and everyone at home, I want you to go in sync with these guys.
[255:51.04]I'll falsetto.
[255:56.40]You know, I got it.
[255:56.90]I got it.
[255:58.00]Yeah, that's great.
[255:59.28]That's great.
[256:00.24]I did.
[256:00.68]I did some.
[256:01.35]I did some of that.
[256:02.59]Oh, yeah.
[256:03.11]I was in the right.
[256:04.49]You're good at it.
[256:05.67]I think there was one person back there, though, that was slightly off pitch.
[256:09.41]I'm not going to throw any names out.
[256:10.85]It was me.
[256:11.35]I heard something.
[256:12.23]I heard something.
[256:14.33]But I think with some practice, we got it for next time.
[256:19.71]I love that cutscene so much.
[256:21.21]I love this cutscene, yeah.
[256:22.19]I mean, here's the thing.
[256:24.48]It's kind of a silly, stupid meme, right?
[256:26.48]But there's a lot of cutscenes I have to sit through every single day, so you gotta make them entertaining somehow, right?
[256:33.64]Yeah, now once we're done with this, there's, like I said, a lot more glitches, but now there's no more, like...
[256:38.94]Okay, at least for another 40 minutes.
[256:40.90]There's no more glitches that can, like, lose enormous amounts of time.
[256:45.57]So I can finally slightly relax for a short period of time.
[256:50.41]So I'm going to save to save my game right here.
[256:55.73]And now we are going to finally go to the first dungeon of the game, Dragon Root.
[257:01.45]The first dungeon, second.
[257:03.47]Yeah, exactly.
[257:04.21]Just confirm it.
[257:05.19]Yeah.
[257:06.72]So thankfully, very conveniently, the idea of how I normally would play this game is you would get three pearls and then you would place them around the ocean.
[257:15.63]But the path that I need to Super Swim to get back to Dragon Roost has one of those islands where I can place one of the pearls.
[257:22.07]so it's very convenient for the routing.
[257:24.25]I also have to avoid all the islands here, so you basically need to half-memorize the ocean, and it's really hard to see, too.
[257:30.12]I'm sure you can tell that Endless Night's pretty awful.
[257:32.38]And these islands are not big, so it's kind of annoying to see where all the islands are, but hopefully all of them will go well.
[257:40.04]And it kind of plays scary music, too.
[257:42.87]It freaks you out.
[257:44.63]It's almost like the music knows what's happening.
[257:46.89]I'd get to this part of the speedrun, and I'd be shaking.
[257:49.89]And thankfully, there's only about another ten, or sorry, two more Super Sims during Endless Night, and then we can get some nice, beautiful, calm, you know, kind of summer-ish Wind Waker music.
[257:59.20]And why did we get Endless Night?
[258:01.24]Uh, so it's just, normally you'd only have for a short time.
[258:03.76]It's basically a spawn the pirate ship, get the bombs, and then you get the third pearl.
[258:07.25]Right, right, right, right.
[258:08.03]But for routing purposes, I do it immediately to get bombs, but then I don't get the third pearl, which ends this event until way later.
[258:18.34]Um...
[258:19.93]But right here, we're finally coming up in Dragon Roof.
[258:23.53]We're going to go inside, and we're hopefully going to have a good time.
[258:27.33]I'm never going to get tired of this glitch.
[258:28.74]It's so cool.
[258:30.04]So awesome.
[258:30.92]Also, I feel like maybe this is a little bit late to say, but epilepsy warning.
[258:36.30]Afterwards.
[258:37.06]By the way, if you made it through the 43 minutes, the 44th one is insane.
[258:47.14]Yeah.
[258:48.30]But anyways, now we're back at Dragon Roost, and I want to get up.
[258:52.24]However, there's all the early game cutscenes that I skipped.
[258:54.76]So I don't want to walk where I'm supposed to walk.
[258:57.46]So I think that we should do everything in our power to not have to watch them.
[259:01.56]So let's do that.
[259:02.35]So we're going to instead fly up to get to the back entrance.
[259:07.35]Oh, obviously.
[259:08.21]So I'm going to mash here.
[259:10.33]I love the sounds.
[259:12.73]He so badly wants to say, ha!
[259:18.06]Just let him do it, man.
[259:20.46]Just let him do it.
[259:22.97]Oh, thanks.
[259:23.25]There you go.
[259:23.69]That was awesome.
[259:24.35]Thank you.
[259:24.75]Appreciate it.
[259:31.25]And now we're inside of Dragon Roost and we can finally head towards Dragon Roost Cavern.
[259:35.20]You're going to see I'm going to continue to take damage.
[259:38.08]I have an even longer zombie hover coming up soon to skip the entire next or 80% of the next dungeon.
[259:46.41]It's a really cool dungeon, though.
[259:48.19]There's a lot of sequence breaks.
[259:50.27]I think if you haven't played this game, Kat, have all of you guys behind played Wind Waker, actually?
[259:53.63]I played once.
[259:55.83]I don't play any fucking video games, apparently.
[259:59.23]This was released in 2001, so I was like, maybe there's a chance that, you know... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[260:04.97]What are you trying to say with that?
[260:06.47]I played Elden Ring.
[260:08.99]That's a new game!
[260:11.58]Anyways, anyways.
[260:13.70]Now we're in Dragon Roost.
[260:16.48]And the objective here is to take down damage.
[260:18.94]I am... Also, one thing I haven't mentioned, by the way, is there is a bunch of text that I'm constantly skipping through in the Tingle Tuner.
[260:25.22]And there's a bunch of secret lore of a story with Tingle.
[260:28.05]It's really fun.
[260:29.41]And he also hides secret treasures.
[260:31.67]So I know for a... So if I explode a bomb with Tingle right there, a 50 rupee will spawn.
[260:36.41]So throughout the run, I will get secret rupees through those kind of end system.
[260:40.14]So I'm gonna take some damage here.
[260:41.68]Okay.
[260:44.04]Then I'm gonna take them down, get the stick, and you can see I'm gonna explode this bomb, and all of a sudden, right there, 50 rupee will be right there.
[260:50.67]Thank you.
[260:53.69]Then I'm going to go up here and spawn the chest.
[260:59.15]It's such a cool time save to throw the torch instead of lighting it yourself.
[261:05.42]Yeah, there's a lot of small optimizations for sure.
[261:09.33]Now, normally, this dungeon, if you don't know the dungeon layout, would basically be kind of like a spiral that's going upwards.
[261:15.73]You're kind of going up in a tower, but around, like, a mountain, if that makes sense.
[261:19.27]But that means that if I can get to the top early, I can save a lot of time.
[261:24.83]There is an RNG-based chance that a falling rock can hit my head and lose me a lot of time here, so let's hope that doesn't happen, but
[261:30.92]If it doesn't, and I have good mashing here... Oh, no, there's the rocks.
[261:34.78]So I'm going to try and mash my way all the way up here without getting hit by a rock, and I need to be very consistent here.
[261:49.30]You said you have to do this 15 times a second, right?
[261:52.54]Yeah, 15 times a second.
[261:53.52]So for this one, you can technically average around 14 and still make it, actually.
[262:01.33]I'm actually going to cancel this heal here because I timed it slightly early.
[262:04.95]Your nose.
[262:09.42]Okay.
[262:11.66]Wow.
[262:12.80]Okay.
[262:13.40]Well, we made it.
[262:14.66]This is fine.
[262:15.82]Okay, so we just have to wait for the heal to go through, and we're good.
[262:19.03]Nice!
[262:21.29]Woo!
[262:21.99]You were killing it, man.
[262:23.41]And here's the nice thing.
[262:24.67]That's the last super physical trick I have, because I need a breather, so I'm pretty happy about that.
[262:31.21]Is this the part of the run where I mention the Link's arm image?
[262:36.90]Oh, no.
[262:38.04]There is, yeah, if you, I think actually I have a thumbnail, but if you just Google Link is seven swole, you will see an old thumbnail that, like, a secondary channel uploaded.
[262:46.92]where you can see the difference with my left and right arm from doing these glitches.
[262:51.15]And it's not photoshopped, and it is scary what the difference is.
[262:54.51]He has rippling biceps on his right arm.
[262:57.36]But only the right arm.
[263:01.57]It's a beautiful photo.
[263:02.81]You think it was a coincidence I was wearing this bomber jacket, chat?
[263:07.01]He needs to hide it, you know?
[263:08.53]It's a sleeper build.
[263:10.29]Exactly.
[263:10.77]Hey, if people say speedruns aren't physical, take a look at that photo.
[263:16.13]Yeah.
[263:16.45]There's a little bit of field stank with the audio here, thankfully.
[263:19.83]This is a very short area, so it's fine.
[263:22.29]There is some stank on that fire.
[263:25.09]Yeah.
[263:31.46]Yeah, it's fine.
[263:32.36]I know that that can happen sometimes with upscalers.
[263:34.46]I know my old Wii to HDMI adapter did it.
[263:36.97]I had to buy three different separate adapters before I finally found one that didn't have it.
[263:41.87]So for some reason, when you're upscaling this game, it can happen, but there's only two areas where that sound glitch happened.
[263:48.42]This is one of them, so it won't be a big deal for the run.
[263:50.58]So if you're working in tech right now, don't panic.
[263:52.84]You don't need to change anything.
[263:54.50]We're about to leave.
[263:55.72]There's somebody in broadcast right now.
[263:57.00]It's like, what is it?
[263:57.81]It's freaking out.
[263:58.55]What is going on?
[263:59.13]Yeah, I don't know why they're specific.
[264:01.19]It must be something with the pitch of the high pit of, like, Baloo, the dragon, screaming.
[264:06.25]You have to be one of the most knowledgeable people of Wind Waker in general.
[264:12.52]So for finding glitches, absolutely not.
[264:14.96]I just like to study them and read the ones that are already found.
[264:17.66]Can I get... It's only frame perfect.
[264:19.56]Hello?
[264:19.92]It's only frame perfect.
[264:22.32]Sorry, I say that on stream all the time.
[264:23.62]I don't mean to sound... No, that's amazing.
[264:26.64]I love that.
[264:29.25]Whoa!
[264:31.26]Okay.
[264:31.80]There you go.
[264:32.96]Nice.
[264:34.30]Yeah, so most of these are not reaction-based, so it's kind of just, like, muscle memory of, like, doing this motion, basically, so, like, YX.
[264:43.56]So they become very consistent.
[264:46.08]This ledge, for some reason, is the ledge I struggle with the most, and I cannot explain why.
[264:52.30]It does not work in practice.
[264:53.38]It doesn't work in runs.
[264:54.34]Some days it works perfectly.
[264:55.46]I am going to blame it on Cosmic Race because that makes me feel better.
[265:01.60]What is this, Mario 64?
[265:04.43]Oh, my God.
[265:06.23]Well, the good thing is we're about to leave this area and Tech can finally relax that we are done with Crispy Audio.
[265:14.91]Well, we have a couple donations.
[265:16.37]So right ahead.
[265:17.75]We have a $69 donation by P. Eugene.
[265:21.89]Life's a garden.
[265:22.83]Dig it.
[265:24.53]We have a $50 anonymous donation and another $50 anonymous donation.
[265:30.26]They're killing it.
[265:31.98]Thank you, everybody.
[265:32.70]Yeah.
[265:33.30]AYB with a $25 donation.
[265:35.40]Also singing back when we were doing Makar.
[265:38.42]Just a bunch of A's.
[265:39.98]It's beautiful.
[265:40.67]It's beautiful.
[265:41.39]Beautiful.
[265:43.23]Right here, I'm going to do chest storage again.
[265:46.13]So I'm going to get storage right here.
[265:50.99]Frame early.
[265:51.33]Sorry.
[265:51.67]There we go.
[265:54.28]Store this chest.
[265:55.32]Thankfully, the collision on the sides here, because you're not supposed to walk up, were kind of glitchy, so I can clip through.
[266:00.10]I can go through the gap.
[266:00.84]That was the most casual clip through I've ever seen.
[266:03.68]I'm sorry.
[266:05.02]Can you go slower to make us all look better?
[266:06.65]If we were ahead of schedule, sure.
[266:10.05]But I think I won't have time for that right now.
[266:13.87]It's like the walls are made out of butter.
[266:17.19]Yeah.
[266:17.89]Thankfully, right here, we're going to have a very calm boss fight, and this one is going to be exactly like the base game.
[266:24.59]There is no fancy strat, so this is a great time to just chill, talk, read some donations, anything like that.
[266:32.30]Hell yeah.
[266:33.14]I might go grab a snack.
[266:35.34]I got some bar behind me.
[266:36.22]Oh, you got some behind you?
[266:37.18]Yeah, I was like, I'm in it for the long run, right?
[266:39.56]Like, this is such a cool speed run.
[266:41.12]I don't want to miss a single second.
[266:43.52]Oh my god.
[266:44.66]Yeah, for anyone who's watching at home and really don't want to miss anything super important and just want a snack, the developers have left us with a mid-micro food break, thankfully.
[266:52.70]In the middle of the game, there's going to be a back-to-back cutscene with only, like, one small out-of-bounds clip.
[266:58.26]So it's basically just, like, cutscene, cutscene.
[267:00.00]So there's a solid seven minutes, eight minutes there of downtime.
[267:05.47]But the rest is usually sword guns.
[267:08.07]We have a $3 donation from Hyruler.
[267:10.67]$1 for every controller Linkus has used so far.
[267:14.01]Are we going to see any more?
[267:17.19]There's only two for this one.
[267:18.66]I think the only game that really worked for my analog stick was... I'm a Joy-Con fan for the Switch, and I have what I like to call an actual Joy-Con graveyard.
[267:28.52]I think I'm on Joy-Con 12.
[267:30.61]Oh my god.
[267:32.59]Because wiggling the analog stick for some Breath of the Wild glitches really wears out the Joy-Cons.
[267:40.45]Maybe next year, if there's one, you guys could see that.
[267:44.30]Otherwise, go to speedrun.com slash Breath of the Wild.
[267:47.86]A bunch of amazing runners who run that game.
[267:51.30]I recommend it.
[267:52.02]I recommend you check out any Zelda run, honestly.
[267:54.32]Slightly biased, but yeah, it's fun.
[267:56.60]I agree.
[267:57.08]That's crazy.
[267:57.54]Yeah.
[267:59.52]Yeah, I think it's this beautiful thing.
[268:00.96]I think this is why Zelda and Mario Speedruns are so kind of popular, is that when you get to Zelda, if you watch one, you will realize that what really defines a Zelda run is its glitches.
[268:12.29]Somehow, almost every game in the franchise has absurd glitches that are just so fascinating.
[268:19.23]While, like, Super Mario games might not have as many glitches, but they have, like, some of the best movement out there.
[268:25.66]So it's this beautiful hybrid, and that's why part of why I really love Wind Waker and why I stuck with this one so much is because there's so many movement-based tricks, so it's both movement and glitches.
[268:37.73]Because I used to also speedrun a lot of Mario games.
[268:40.74]That's how I started streaming this through Ludie's Mansion.
[268:44.36]Oh my god.
[268:44.90]Yeah, it looks like there's a lot of varied techniques and just the things that you're doing.
[268:52.58]Yes.
[268:53.20]Could you be a little more specific?
[268:56.22]Just take the obvious.
[268:57.26]I'm smart.
[268:58.10]Yes.
[268:59.43]Yes, I wrote my name on the top of the page.
[269:03.93]Do you mean like the glitches I've been doing in general?
[269:06.02]Yeah, they feel very varied.
[269:07.48]Yeah, they were very varied.
[269:09.36]I mean, like, all the ledges are going to be different for the storage, all the Super Swims are going to be different.
[269:14.44]They're all fundamentally, almost all of them are still based upon that one exploit I explained earlier of storage, right?
[269:20.55]You can play in a non-playable state.
[269:23.57]However, there are so much variety in how you can do.
[269:26.61]So this Super Swim coming up right here, the last one during Endless Night, is going to be incredible, because not only are we going to Super Swim,
[269:35.83]We are going to super swim in the air as well.
[269:39.27]Whoa.
[269:42.07]Why not add another lair?
[269:43.69]Yeah, exactly.
[269:44.78]So you are going to get to see that in a second.
[269:46.86]If you want a space launch in this game, we'll get it.
[269:49.02]Sounds like a varied technique.
[269:50.80]Yeah, you know, a mashable, non-mashable, varied, you know, negative one.
[269:56.94]Yeah.
[270:00.65]We have a $25 donation from Mason.
[270:02.96]Let's go, Lingus.
[270:03.70]Excited to see my favorite run in person.
[270:05.42]Thank you.
[270:05.84]Yeah, please, if you're watching from home, don't forget to donate.
[270:07.70]Remember, this is all for a good cause, alright?
[270:09.78]We're getting money for spinal cord injuries and food.
[270:14.06]Who doesn't love food?
[270:14.82]Especially people who are less fortunate than us absolutely need it.
[270:19.39]So if you have any spare cash, we really recommend you to donate.
[270:22.71]Donating right now is for a good cause, so why not?
[270:25.87]And if you, I'm pretty sure if I'm not mistaken, even if you want to get a t-shirt, some of that still goes to charity.
[270:33.96]If you leave a like on this live stream, if you're watching on YouTube.
[270:36.62]So what, 30 cents?
[270:39.18]What is it?
[270:39.92]Every like is 30 cents that Ludd gives to the charity?
[270:42.29]I don't remember how many exactly, but yeah, he donates 10 cents.
[270:46.67]So even if you have absolutely no money to donate, which is totally fine, you can still support it completely for free by just clicking one button on YouTube.
[270:56.13]So definitely recommend if you do that.
[271:00.30]But anyways, now when we are through with the...
[271:03.14]Like I said, we're coming up to the middle part.
[271:05.66]That's why we have a good amount of cutscenes here.
[271:09.21]I'm going to get storage.
[271:13.71]Here, I'm going to do the same thing I did earlier.
[271:15.77]Basically, I'm going to get storage while the text is on screen.
[271:18.64]That's just so I can skip a cutscene while super swimming.
[271:21.65]For later, if I can time this trick.
[271:25.90]It's only very perfect.
[271:26.76]I keep being a frame late.
[271:28.44]I want to blame the monitor, but at the same time, I feel like maybe it's the skill issue, but this is very strange.
[271:34.70]I think I'm speaking for everyone.
[271:39.08]I don't think any of us can get this.
[271:42.30]Not without the practice and the work you put in.
[271:44.04]I don't think I can do it with the practice.
[271:48.89]Yeah, so right here is one of my favorite newer techniques.
[271:52.51]This got implemented only a few years ago.
[271:54.85]So I'm gonna combine the use of Tingle's Greedy Shop and, um...
[272:02.23]Super swimming.
[272:02.67]So you see how the air meter is pretty low already?
[272:05.25]So you cannot get through the entire ocean.
[272:07.93]I want to go here.
[272:08.81]That's pretty far away.
[272:10.11]So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start purchasing a Tingle Balloon on my Game Boy Advance.
[272:17.39]And then you're going to see what I'm going to do right here.
[272:19.35]So now when I have this much speed, I'm going to start.
[272:25.12]I'm going to get an angle towards this island here.
[272:29.40]And then I'm going to get an aero fill by simply just walking in the air.
[272:34.54]What?
[272:34.96]And that maintains all my speed.
[272:37.18]And you can see now my aerometer is full because, hey, I just left and reentered the water.
[272:42.36]That's how it works.
[272:44.02]Yeah, you're right.
[272:44.92]That is how it works.
[272:45.70]Exactly.
[272:46.54]And now, hopefully, if I'm not bad, I should be able to make it down here to Outset Island and never had to make a single stop on the way.
[273:01.42]Alright.
[273:06.50]Wow.
[273:07.00]And then here we can finally say goodbye to Endless Night.
[273:10.31]By the way, here's where you're supposed to go after getting bombs.
[273:12.45]We finally made it here.
[273:13.93]We've caught up.
[273:15.01]We're going to void out by purpose on that Wyrla Wind, which is kind of if you fail to break the wall that's on the back here.
[273:20.32]That's what you're supposed to do with the bombs.
[273:23.74]I have a lot of text boxes here because I've never talked to Kingred Lions.
[273:26.46]I've been ignoring this whole time.
[273:27.72]So he has a lot to get through.
[273:28.68]Some drama dumping.
[273:31.38]He will do that a few times.
[273:32.46]We do have some donations.
[273:33.90]Yeah, go right ahead.
[273:34.42]I'm just going to break a wall and go through our cutscenes.
[273:36.10]So this is a great time for donations.
[273:38.52]Well, great timing.
[273:39.89]We got a $200 donation from Anonymous.
[273:41.51]That says food.
[273:46.89]Yeah.
[273:47.91]We have a $7 donation from $7 train for Linkus 7.
[273:54.03]And then another $7 donation, a 7 for Linkus 7.
[273:56.43]A 7?
[273:56.97]Are we getting a $7 Linkus 7 train?
[274:03.65]I've been crazy.
[274:04.81]We have a $25 donation from Jeremy.
[274:06.71]Much love, guys.
[274:07.35]Amazing for you all to do this.
[274:09.31]You know, I didn't tell you this before, Eric.
[274:11.11]Yeah, what's up?
[274:11.57]That is why I made it link to seven back when I wanted to play like old Facebook games in like 2008, 2009.
[274:16.10]Oh, really?
[274:16.62]That was why I made it link to seven because I knew that this day would come or a $7 donation drain would finally come.
[274:23.52]The June 2nd, 2024 would come around knowing.
[274:26.78]Exactly.
[274:27.54]While we got a $100 donation.
[274:28.60]How about that?
[274:29.00]Oh, my God.
[274:32.77]From Paul, Linkus, this speedrun has been insane.
[274:35.93]Keep doing what you're doing.
[274:37.11]Thank you.
[274:37.47]I appreciate it.
[274:38.01]You're incredible at it, man.
[274:39.15]You're crazy.
[274:41.65]Yeah, I'm sorry that it's a lot, but trust me when I say that it just gets more and more fun.
[274:51.38]And once you kind of understand, like I said, the basics, it is such an incredible run, and it has such rarity and glitches.
[274:57.45]It doesn't.
[274:58.59]I think Jerma put it perfectly that even though technically I'm still just doing storage, the ways that you can do storage truly never ends.
[275:06.72]So it still feels refreshing anywhere you go.
[275:08.44]Oh, my God.
[275:08.90]Look at all the $7 donations we got going on.
[275:11.20]Yo.
[275:11.84]Yeah.
[275:12.42]It's happening.
[275:13.32]It's happening.
[275:14.92]They're flying in.
[275:16.57]Let's do it.
[275:17.23]Oh, my God.
[275:18.17]Seven train go link is going.
[275:19.69]Shout out to the late night crowd and the couch casters.
[275:21.67]Thank you, Abbey Bagel.
[275:22.55]Appreciate it.
[275:23.29]Keep me updated, Eric, because I can't see the tracker, but chat, can we during this run hit 130K?
[275:27.37]Let's see if we can do it.
[275:30.53]Oh, we can hit 130K.
[275:31.15]Let's get that $7 train.
[275:32.49]Let's keep going.
[275:33.32]Oh, my God.
[275:34.62]Oh, my God.
[275:36.54]Do a keg stand for $7.
[275:37.62]I don't even know what that is.
[275:43.16]Choo-choo, $7 for Lucas.
[275:44.32]Ovaltine, Jenkins, couch train.
[275:47.56]Oh, keep it up.
[275:48.28]Oh, my God.
[275:50.56]It's crazy.
[275:51.74]That's a lot of sevens.
[275:52.64]That's a lot of sevens.
[275:54.78]Thank you.
[275:55.22]Seven, seven, more, more, more, more.
[275:57.02]More sevens.
[275:58.95]Oh, my God.
[275:59.97]There's so many.
[276:01.81]I'm so impressed.
[276:02.63]I think we get to 130K.
[276:03.43]Every couple of seconds is a new seven.
[276:05.65]Just wow.
[276:07.74]They're all going.
[276:09.40]Some people just name seven.
[276:11.64]Some of them named Seven.
[276:13.98]Also, quickly, we're done with King of Red Lions.
[276:16.12]I don't want to sail anymore, so we're going back to Super Swimming, but it was nice while it lasted.
[276:21.07]Yeah, it's kind of weird to see you sail at this point.
[276:25.53]Thank you, David Cockrings, for the Seven.
[276:28.41]Classic.
[276:29.13]I have one more sailing section that lasts about five seconds.
[276:31.63]Love that guy.
[276:32.84]So we have another five-second sailing section after a cutscene because it spawns us in him.
[276:36.90]Otherwise, I don't think there's another part where we actually use the boat.
[276:40.30]He's just that slow.
[276:41.75]Aw, that's unfortunate.
[276:43.09]That's fine.
[276:44.53]Yeah, you have to be really careful.
[276:47.15]I haven't shown this because
[276:50.33]I would just lose.
[276:51.13]But Link does not perfectly move 180 degrees.
[276:55.33]He's actually moving slightly off axis.
[276:57.91]So I'm going to show you right now.
[276:59.41]This is how he spins if I hold straight up.
[277:01.55]So I have to perfectly navigate slightly outside of perfectly up, which is really hard when you have these thick notches that wants to snap you into a perfect up.
[277:10.23]to at all control what is happening throughout all of this.
[277:15.45]There's a lot of stuff happening, but we got this.
[277:22.00]Oh, my God.
[277:22.82]We have a $77 donation.
[277:26.18]One upping everybody else?
[277:27.36]I have to scroll because there's so many.
[277:30.50]It's from StatStat.
[277:31.68]All sevens.
[277:33.06]I'm going to count all of these.
[277:34.64]I'm going to get you a final count of the seven train.
[277:36.92]I got you.
[277:37.40]Yeah.
[277:37.90]Can you count?
[277:39.00]Actually, so we don't miss any.
[277:40.84]Can you count with your hands, actually?
[277:42.12]I guess we're going to miss any.
[277:44.32]So anytime someone comes up, just add one with your hands.
[277:45.86]There's not enough fingers.
[277:47.04]We've got three people.
[277:47.70]We've got 30.
[277:47.94]Yeah.
[277:48.04]Oh, no.
[277:52.62]People in the back.
[277:53.28]Hands in the back.
[277:53.74]I'm up to 34, 35.
[277:54.12]Link is so locked in during all this, might I add.
[278:22.41]Such great focus.
[278:31.31]We're going to get a cutscene here.
[278:32.53]So like I said, in the middle of this game, there's a good amount here.
[278:34.95]So to summarize the story in case you have had a hard time keeping up, just in case, the general super summarized story of this is we want to save our sister.
[278:47.04]She got captured.
[278:48.00]She's stuck in Forsaken Fortress.
[278:49.79]We can't get her, so we leave.
[278:51.82]We proceed to go and capture these pearls around these two dungeons and from Jabu Jabu, who's the big fish who was in the cave.
[278:59.99]Once we collect all three, we can raise the third dungeon in the game, Tower of the Gods.
[279:04.23]And this was a trial left behind by the gods of Hyrule to make sure that whoever has the chance to enter Hyrule
[279:12.84]is truly the hero of time, which thankfully we are.
[279:18.14]So that's why we have some cutscenes right now, because we did so much back-to-back.
[279:22.41]So this cutscene will raise the third dungeon, then we have a full dungeon coming up, and after that, we are going to get the other cutscenes, and that's kind of when the lore changes to its endgame lore.
[279:34.54]But then we just have gameplay, gameplay, gameplay of basically no cutscenes for the rest of the game.
[279:39.44]There's a lot of story stuff that's happening right now.
[279:42.48]But I do know that we do them slightly out of order and not everyone can read Japanese.
[279:47.96]We have a $77 donation from Tim, a $77 donation from Anonymous, a $77 donation from Wettles.
[279:59.50]I have counted 103 individual $7 donations.
[280:03.28]Are you serious?
[280:04.24]That's incredible.
[280:05.68]This is crazy.
[280:07.21]Insane.
[280:07.75]Let's keep it up, guys.
[280:08.55]That is incredible.
[280:09.49]Yeah, honestly, claps to you guys at home.
[280:11.49]That is incredible.
[280:12.63]Shout-outs to you guys for helping out an amazing cause.
[280:16.71]107 now.
[280:17.63]I'm still counting.
[280:19.17]Yeah.
[280:24.50]Can we hear an explanation of a barrier skip at some point?
[280:28.02]Oh, it's coming up.
[280:30.89]That's coming up.
[280:31.73]Just wait five minutes.
[280:32.63]Yeah, yeah, my bad, my bad.
[280:33.91]It's one of the most, what, known glitches in Zelda speedrunning?
[280:39.34]I actually, out of, it was the holy grail of, even, you know, you're a PlayStation runner.
[280:43.66]I am.
[280:43.96]And I'm curious, I feel like you might know about Barrier Skip, or heard of it, that its existence, because it was, I would want to make the claim that almost in the speedrunning community, it was kind of one of the holy grails of speedrunning.
[280:58.45]Absolutely.
[280:59.97]In the game's design, basically, you get access to Hyrule already after this dungeon, a third of the way through the game.
[281:06.78]But you can see Ganon's Tower.
[281:08.92]It's the end of the game, but there is this big barrier standing in the way.
[281:12.72]And as a speedrunner, it's almost like a challenge.
[281:14.94]You know what I mean?
[281:15.58]It's like, we can just get through this one wall.
[281:17.99]We can get through every other wall.
[281:18.99]You know what?
[281:19.47]You want to see an example of how I feel about walls?
[281:22.15]This is what we do normally with walls, right?
[281:23.93]Like, we just get right through them.
[281:25.87]So...
[281:27.95]So they normally aren't a big problem, but this wall is very special.
[281:31.74]I'm going to explain all of it when we get there so you can get some visuals along with it.
[281:35.72]But for a very long time, it was the holy grail of speedrunning, but after absolutely years and years of research, it was found.
[281:44.95]When it was found, there was millions of views of different YouTube videos that covered the glitch.
[281:49.97]It is...
[281:51.17]truly a crazy glitch.
[281:52.69]For context, the Any% speedrun, which, if you don't know, is basically beat the game as fast as possible with any strategies available, the speedrun went from four hours to under one hour, thanks to Barrier Skip.
[282:04.75]So it saved about three hours, which, let's just say, is a lot of time in speedrunning.
[282:08.84]Because it's not like we didn't have glitches to make the first four hours fast already, as you probably noticed.
[282:16.04]Right there, by the way, is another beautiful little hint from Tingle.
[282:22.12]Now actually, Point Crow, you can come up here.
[282:25.05]I'm going to demonstrate to everybody that a lot of these glitches that I'm doing are not too impossible.
[282:28.31]If you come up here quickly, Point Crow, I'm quickly going to have you actually perform this one trick.
[282:34.03]So I'm going to set this up, and I'm going to show everybody at home that a lot of these cool glitches you can try in a casual playthrough, and it is not bad.
[282:39.92]I apologize that this controller is a bit sweaty.
[282:42.48]I'm very tired.
[282:43.62]But anyways, so here is what I want you to do right now.
[282:47.70]I want you to tap R and just... So I want you to lay like this, right?
[282:54.17]And then release A, or sorry, release R, and just spam the A button.
[282:57.93]You got it?
[283:00.19]Yeah, so wait, so first crawl, so tap forward.
[283:02.93]Now tap back two times so you're in front of him.
[283:05.09]Yep.
[283:05.63]Now let go of R and spam A.
[283:09.03]And he clips through the floor.
[283:13.28]Great job, yeah.
[283:14.36]And that saves... Okay, now probably 0 seconds, but that saves a good amount of time normally.
[283:18.38]It skips the floor.
[283:19.04]So there's a lot of glitches that I have done throughout this run that are not too difficult.
[283:23.25]So right there, a beautiful, simple exploit where...
[283:29.45]You're too far away to pick up the statue through the floor.
[283:31.87]But if you're crawling, you're close enough where the game would normally let you pick it up.
[283:35.75]But when you're crawling, the developers thought of it and went, no, no, no, you can't pick up anything when you're crawling.
[283:40.85]But during the standing up animation, Link is still kind of down there.
[283:44.70]So during that entire animation of standing back up, as long as you tap A during that time, you pick him right through and you save some time.
[283:54.64]And, yeah, this is also I kind of brushed over it.
[283:58.98]You saw that out of bounds clip I did earlier.
[284:00.96]That skipped half the dungeon, by the way.
[284:04.42]So we're only doing the second half.
[284:05.88]But, yeah, it was just a wall clip you've seen before.
[284:10.58]The second half is better anyway.
[284:11.60]Exactly.
[284:13.99]Moikro, now you actually have to run.
[284:17.02]I'm a certified Wind Waker speedrunner right now.
[284:19.24]Yes.
[284:19.54]That's right.
[284:20.32]You know, this is technically one of the first co-op Wind Waker runs, so we should have a world record.
[284:25.74]World record, dare I say.
[284:28.40]Thank you, thank you.
[284:30.68]The seventh trade is still going on.
[284:32.24]We have 134 now, individual $7 donations.
[284:33.70]I am still counting.
[284:34.88]Get those $7 in for that.
[284:35.58]Let's go!
[284:35.87]League of Seven!
[284:43.32]Let's do it.
[284:47.80]I also realized during this, I'm so used to having OBS on the side because I never realized how often I need to fix my hair from falling on my face.
[284:55.79]But without having the little thing here, I keep being like, is it on my face?
[284:59.61]Are you really speed running if you're not looking good doing it?
[285:02.23]Exactly.
[285:04.37]Right here, I'm supposed to, by the way, build a bridge, play the command Maladius learned to get through this entire room, but I did this setup right here, so hopefully if I do all frame perfect side ops right here by tapping left and A at the same time, with this angle I have, I can get perfectly just barely past that and skip that, and that saves about half a minute.
[285:24.82]That was a pretty fucking varied technique.
[285:27.28]It is very pretty.
[285:27.88]It's a little salty over there.
[285:28.84]It's a little salty, you know what I'm saying?
[285:31.20]That was fucking awesome.
[285:33.40]Now, here is an exploit that I wish existed in hard games.
[285:36.40]We talked about Elden Room before.
[285:37.52]This would be an amazing exploit for harder games.
[285:40.16]So Wind Waker only has one health bar, but some enemies, like this guy, has an armor.
[285:44.74]So what Nintendo did was...
[285:47.10]The damage you deal is on the armor, and then when it breaks off after you get it to zero, it resets the health bar.
[285:53.44]But that can be exploited.
[285:54.72]So I'm going to spin attack to take all the damage.
[285:57.14]He's one hit away from breaking the armor now.
[285:59.21]Then I'm going to knock it off instead of breaking it.
[286:01.79]And because of that, he's two hits away and he's dead.
[286:04.89]Because I didn't let the game reset the health bar.
[286:07.11]Oh my god.
[286:11.05]There's a lot of amazing small techniques like that that is all over the place.
[286:14.53]I can't mention all of them, but
[286:16.48]It's just such a cool speedrun.
[286:17.94]I can't stop nerding out about this game.
[286:22.79]Please never.
[286:23.77]This is so entertaining.
[286:25.49]I'm glued to the screen.
[286:26.49]I've had food to eat behind me for the past 30 minutes.
[286:29.85]I don't want to get up.
[286:31.05]I don't even know what time it is.
[286:32.47]It could be 4 o'clock in the morning.
[286:34.21]I don't even know.
[286:37.70]Thank you, guys.
[286:39.34]Yeah, right here, I'm going to only take down one of these skulls.
[286:43.72]Hopefully, if I don't get absolutely screwed by that guy, I should be able to get through pretty smoothly here.
[286:49.20]We're coming up on the last statue.
[286:50.89]I usually call this on stream an auto-scroller dungeon because, like,
[286:55.31]There's really not much you can do to speed this up, unfortunately.
[286:58.49]In the middle of this room... You skipped half of it.
[287:01.11]Okay, that's true, but the second half of the dungeon... The second half of the dungeon, there's a portal that will spawn in the middle of that pedestal.
[287:08.79]That's why you need these three statues to kind of activate it.
[287:11.83]And, like, the loading zone does not exist, at least to our knowledge, until you've gotten all three of these statues.
[287:17.81]So there's some small strats you've seen out throughout to speed it up.
[287:21.26]But the fundamental aspect of getting all three, there's no way around.
[287:25.88]So we have to do that.
[287:27.10]So I need to play a little bit with my Game Boy Advance.
[287:31.92]You're like those TikTok memes where it's like, oh, I got to play Subway Surfers on the background in order to play my games now.
[287:39.83]Here's another, by the way, beautiful showcase of how if you are confident, it's easier than if you're scared.
[287:46.15]So there is a huge kind of maze here where you have to go on these platforms.
[287:50.62]But if you're just confident and you just go straight for it, it is actually perfectly cycled up so you don't have to do any of it.
[287:56.46]And then I just void out to get back to the door.
[287:59.14]Right here, I just have to hope that I don't get bad luck with these keys hitting me down while I'm climbing.
[288:04.00]I don't really have any...
[288:06.51]I don't really have any items to help me for that.
[288:10.26]I'm going to make this go up.
[288:14.50]Then we're gonna jump off here.
[288:15.44]Don't hit me.
[288:16.06]Thank you.
[288:16.80]Oh my god.
[288:17.66]I'm nervous.
[288:19.38]I'm nervous.
[288:20.76]Now, here's a really cool demonstration of outsmarting Nintendo.
[288:25.51]So I'm sure you've noticed that, even casually, this Game Boy Advance thing is very overpowered if you have the rupees.
[288:31.67]I can walk in the air, I can heal wherever I want.
[288:34.11]So some rooms, they've actually disabled the Tingle Tuner.
[288:38.49]And this next room is one of those.
[288:39.75]You saw that there was kind of like two scales there.
[288:41.92]So there's a whole puzzle I'm supposed to do with this.
[288:44.00]So I cannot use the tingle tuner in the room.
[288:46.50]However, if I start to purchase an item in this room, and you can see, by the way, underneath, when it turns like bright green is when it kicks in, the tingle balloon will kick in.
[288:56.19]I immediately open the door, and it just barely lasts forever.
[289:00.41]long enough to where I can walk past and skip them.
[289:05.29]Whoa!
[289:05.41]So there are aspects in the game where they really did think about it.
[289:08.70]Now, I turned off my Game Boy Advance.
[289:10.34]I will not have to use this again for about another 40 minutes or so.
[289:14.02]So now there's only one controller, finally.
[289:19.91]We can kind of relax.
[289:20.83]Well, you had two, right?
[289:21.59]Because you had the one that's good for that one trick.
[289:24.87]It was Super Swim and everything else.
[289:25.95]Yeah, Super Swimming, then the Game Boy, and then the Play Controller.
[289:31.40]That's crazy, man.
[289:32.64]That's real crazy.
[289:34.62]I'm curious.
[289:37.56]Does the community think there's other places to save a ton of time in this run?
[289:43.52]No, unfortunately not.
[289:45.07]Is it really close to being almost as good as it could be?
[289:48.49]yes so uh there have been a few strats that were tasks only but as time has gone on and more people especially 2020 covet everyone had too much time on their hands um let's just say that most glitches that were like no one would want to do this just ended up being done so that you know manual super soon trick implemented uh there's another glitch where you know like that mashing trick I did
[290:12.85]There is a way in any percent where you can skip one of the final bosses of the game.
[290:20.43]But it required you to do that perfectly, not dropping it almost at all, for two minutes almost.
[290:28.77]And that was task only and known for over ten years.
[290:32.04]Now you need to do it to get the world record.
[290:33.96]So there's almost no strats that are left.
[290:39.04]um and this community because this was one of the incredible things actually so remember I mentioned like barrier skip uh can get you to the end of the game and uh it would completely change everything so people ended up data mining this game and looking at all the flags all the layers and everything so before like I think like five years or something before we found barrier skip
[291:02.33]We already had the optimal route for if Barrier Skip was found, because we wanted it so badly that people made cheat codes to get through it.
[291:09.75]So you would do a normal run, but use a cheat to get past that one part.
[291:15.14]So... Yeah, this game has been figured out for a very long time.
[291:20.20]If you've been around speedrunning for a long time, you'll probably know that around... In between I would say the era of 2012 to 2015,
[291:27.22]arguably Wind Waker was as big, if not bigger, than even Ocarina of Timeless at that time.
[291:32.40]It's falling a little bit out of the limelight in recent years, but, uh, try to bring it back!
[291:36.90]Um, but, yeah, it's still an incredible game and so many new things are found.
[291:41.97]I actually do have one new glitch that was found, um, that saved 20 seconds, I will do in this run, and, um,
[291:53.85]It is very precise, and I think once you see it, you will understand why.
[291:59.69]So, to explain to you, Jerma, when you ask, you know, is there anything left to be found?
[292:05.40]The most recent glitches that were found were so precise that they are float-valuable.
[292:11.09]Now, if that doesn't mean anything to people at home who don't know what a float is, don't worry about it.
[292:15.59]What you need to know is this.
[292:16.71]It is so precise that a community member wrote a program that can run dozens of instances of Wind Waker at the same time, so he let his computer run for days in a row to try every single value against walls and corners to see could you theoretically flip through them.
[292:35.09]Because it is so precise that a human could never in a lifetime discover it.
[292:39.67]So we literally have computer programs running to try and see if wall clips are possible.
[292:44.20]That is how far the community has gotten.
[292:46.14]That's insane.
[292:46.90]That's unbelievable.
[292:48.28]Hey, you know, you say all this, but some speedrun explained history video down the line will say, oh, and then they found this weird new thing.
[293:00.30]And it saved an hour.
[293:01.50]Yeah.
[293:03.50]The entire run, it's been gone.
[293:05.99]You say this arbitrary code execution hasn't been found on Wind Waker yet.
[293:09.72]I hope not.
[293:10.58]Never.
[293:11.75]You don't want to do Ace?
[293:13.11]No.
[293:14.07]So I know this game is very glitch-heavy, but in my preference, I like when... I love when there's a good hybrid of... I'm playing the game with glitches as my assistants.
[293:25.98]I don't know if that makes sense.
[293:26.86]Maybe you just think it's all a glitch fest here.
[293:28.28]Yeah, you don't want the game to be the glitch.
[293:30.52]Yeah, exactly.
[293:30.98]There's still a lot of original stuff coming in here.
[293:33.70]It's just that glitches can speed up or skip certain parts, but the other stuff is intact.
[293:38.50]So I know some people love the integrity of basically programming the game if you don't know what arbitrary code execution is.
[293:43.77]But I think it's a bit more boring when you're kind of just doing purely nonsense programming the game and then you warp to the end.
[293:51.21]So I like having to kind of play up there.
[293:55.29]Now we're coming up towards Hyrule, the main part, and we're coming up on the hardest part very soon.
[294:01.97]But before that, I need to get down to Hyrule itself.
[294:05.03]Thankfully, there's some
[294:06.63]things to speed it up.
[294:07.33]Nintendo forgot to put collision underneath here, so I can kind of just flip through and activate the cutscene.
[294:13.10]That'll never get old.
[294:13.80]That's so cool.
[294:16.52]Also, I stopped for the meme ringing the bell.
[294:18.52]It was supposed to ring during that cutscene.
[294:19.88]You can hear it continues, but the game doesn't actually
[294:22.78]chat if you're winging it as long as you're grappling it.
[294:25.20]So for the meme, I just stopped.
[294:28.28]But yeah, we have a cut scene right here.
[294:30.33]So if you're going to read a few donations, feel free.
[294:32.15]Oh, we have tons.
[294:33.25]Oh, my god.
[294:34.47]We have a $77 donation from Noah and Amanda.
[294:38.79]Favorite game ever.
[294:39.65]Favorite speed runner.
[294:40.73]Super happy to be catching this live.
[294:42.09]Also, love the cause and super happy to support it.
[294:45.05]Thank you.
[294:45.77]We have a $77 donation from anonymous.
[294:47.61]Guys, this is a $7 trade.
[294:49.13]You're getting 77s.
[294:51.04]Oh, my God.
[294:53.20]We're up to, God, it's like 149.
[294:54.88]I'm starting to lose count.
[294:56.58]What's the seven count?
[294:57.46]It's like 149, I think, right now.
[294:59.23]Like, 150 if you count the 77s?
[295:00.05]Wow.
[295:03.17]Oh, my God.
[295:03.75]$25 donation from Hyper.
[295:07.71]Hyper can't wait.
[295:09.33]144p Hypercam tutorial from 2008.
[295:11.05]That's their name.
[295:12.49]This is such an amazing speedrun.
[295:14.37]Thank you for the great entertainment.
[295:16.63]Of course.
[295:16.99]Thank you for watching.
[295:18.69]There's so many.
[295:19.29]I have to scroll back.
[295:23.86]Yeah, Waffles, $77 donation.
[295:25.56]$7 train.
[295:26.32]So glad I get to watch Linkus showcase this amazing run.
[295:28.98]Keep it up, everybody.
[295:30.60]Thank you.
[295:33.98]Now, for this part, this is where, if you ever watch me run this game live, this is where 80-90% of runs die.
[295:42.59]So, unfortunately for the run, after you pass all the early game stuff,
[295:47.89]This category, unfortunately, has basically put all the hardest glitches back to back to back, so I have five brutal glitches that I have to perform within the span of ten minutes, and some of them just lose time, and some of them will straight up just kill my run by...
[296:05.50]soft locking or doing other shenanigans.
[296:09.67]But when we get to that, I'm going to try and explain as well as I can.
[296:14.23]I might slow down for just Barrier Skip to really make you understand that one because it's very complex.
[296:20.46]But all the other stuff will hopefully...
[296:24.40]go well.
[296:25.60]That being said, now we're in Hyrule.
[296:27.68]Before I get into the main room, I'm gonna do one thing since it's a marathon, which is I'm gonna get one extra piece of magic.
[296:34.21]If I have perfect magic management, I don't need it, but in case I miss one singular leaf pump, I would like it.
[296:44.90]I actually haven't mentioned it.
[296:45.66]Every time I leaf, I do a very precise trick because you're losing height when you're flying with the leaf slowly.
[296:51.51]But anytime you take out the leaf, Link kind of does a animation to kind of start off.
[296:56.45]So I do leaf pumps every time I fly to maintain my height.
[296:59.31]So what I do when I leaf is I press A and then I think two or three frames later, I take my leaf out again.
[297:04.34]So I'm kind of doing this rhythm of A and X.
[297:07.08]to maintain it.
[297:07.78]But if I accidentally press X too early, then I'll just fall and void out.
[297:11.66]So it's quite important to have some extra magic.
[297:14.92]Right here I'm supposed to do a long puzzle.
[297:16.76]I don't want to do that, so I'm going to clip inside of this pillar.
[297:20.60]Speedrunner's laziness.
[297:21.66]Yeah.
[297:22.98]Then I'm going to fall underneath the map and go to the loading zone.
[297:26.34]I don't want to complete this puzzle, so I practiced this trick for 30 hours.
[297:31.32]So I just never do it again.
[297:32.62]Honestly, it looks so cool.
[297:33.78]True.
[297:36.74]But yeah, so... Let's have a break and do some donations.
[297:43.27]This is the last cutscene we're gonna enjoy before we get into the biggest glitchfest of the run, so let's get some donations, let's have a good time, and then let's get into the real part.
[297:53.38]Well, we got a $7 donation from five brutal glitches.
[297:57.66]Yeah, he gets it.
[297:58.38]Whoa, it's the guy.
[298:00.96]$7 donation from anonymous, from Nyla, any seveners, million 77, 177, seven, seven,
[298:14.05]Dingle McBingleberry.
[298:17.61]The $7, you know?
[298:19.81]Hey, I don't know these names, man.
[298:25.66]We got a $10 donation from Sweden Raccoon.
[298:28.98]Love what you guys are doing.
[298:31.42]I've been watching for over 14 hours now.
[298:33.34]Love from Sweden.
[298:35.56]And keep up the great work.
[298:37.20]Alright.
[298:37.82]Yeah, I'm Swedish, by the way, in case I didn't say that already.
[298:44.35]Linkus, you give huge Swedish energy.
[298:46.27]Yeah, thank you.
[298:47.59]Good.
[298:49.43]We have a $7 donation from Cubpur.
[298:52.22]This run is absolutely crazy, and Linkus7 is a god at this game.
[298:55.54]Thank you for a great cause and good luck.
[298:58.16]Thank you.
[298:58.76]I also want to say before we get into like all the crazy glitches here, I might be good at running this game, but honestly, this run would not be possible without the community members who are the true champions who are finding these glitches, because that's where like, I think people kind of forget like how many hours
[299:15.54]people are spending to look for these glitches and make these run possible.
[299:18.46]And all I do is I just play them, right?
[299:20.10]I just do the glitch.
[299:21.30]So, really huge shout-out to the Winric community.
[299:23.75]They're an incredible community, and they're very, very helpful.
[299:28.19]So, if you are interested at all to pick up this game, I heavily recommend joining the Speedrun Discord.
[299:33.79]You will find it on speedrun.com.
[299:36.40]They're very helpful.
[299:38.10]They're amazing people, and I definitely recommend to check them out.
[299:41.28]We have a $77 donation from StatStat.
[299:45.06]He's a bad that every time Ligas says, but before, I'm expecting him to launch into an ad break.
[299:51.82]And then $77 from Alex and Tiffany.
[299:54.95]Love this game.
[299:55.51]Thank you for everyone putting on this event.
[299:58.11]You guys are so sweet.
[299:59.34]Oh, my God.
[300:00.30]We might reach 130.
[300:00.82]Yeah, let's do it.
[300:02.86]Yeah, 124 right now.
[300:03.72]Yeah.
[300:03.86]Oh, we just crossed 124,000.
[300:04.64]Oh, my God.
[300:05.27]Oh, we're getting there.
[300:05.85]Give it up, guys.
[300:13.54]This is Barrier Skip, so I'm gonna stop for just a second to explain it.
[300:16.36]So, I'm in Hyrule, you're here a third of the game way through.
[300:18.98]You see that tower?
[300:19.94]That's Ganon's tower.
[300:21.34]The only thing standing in my way is a barrier.
[300:23.37]This was undefeated for a long time.
[300:25.15]There's two parts to this barrier.
[300:27.61]An invisible wall and a knockback part.
[300:29.33]The first thing I'm gonna do is glitch to cancel the knockback part.
[300:32.27]So if you're ever outside of this cylinder, you will get knockback.
[300:35.49]If you take the Wind Waker on the same frame, though, my damage from ability free amounts, I've canceled it, so now I'm past it.
[300:40.01]But you can see there's still an invisible wall, I can't get through.
[300:43.30]Well for a long time we couldn't skip through this.
[300:44.75]You can't grab this railing, you can't get through it. There's no chest to get chest storage, anything like that.
[300:49.00]However do you see very closely there if you're looking that like it kind of like goes in the middle there it's not a perfect cylinder you see there like right left of my feet if I go herem you see how this kind of goes into the middle?
[300:59.00]So there is one pixel of the invisible wall that is missing so I'm going to try and do a ridiculous precise setup here so um. This might take me a few tries but hopefully we get it so.
[301:14.17]Ah, second try frame.
[301:15.33]So I need to do, um, I need to do eight frame-perfect side hops, uh, in a row.
[301:22.62]Uh, to first get in the middle part.
[301:37.98]Second frame, come on.
[301:40.36]One second, sorry.
[301:42.04]Um...
[301:46.05]I can't time it.
[301:46.87]I'm gonna blame the monitor, even though it's probably my fault.
[301:49.79]I'm overthinking it.
[301:54.91]You got this?
[301:55.41]You got this, Ligas?
[301:57.69]Sorry.
[302:03.13]I can't time it.
[302:04.05]Hold on.
[302:10.05]OK, so hopefully I did that.
[302:10.95]So now when I'm in the middle, I need to do a very precise one.
[302:13.59]So you know it's 360 degrees, you can look around in any direction here.
[302:16.86]Well, the game can actually register about 65,000 values for 360 degrees.
[302:19.72]And I have an 11-unit window in those 36,000 to get this angle.
[302:26.50]so with this setup I did if I did it correctly by spinning around here two times and I'm pausing in a specific frame I will hopefully have the angle value so if I did everything right now uh what uh hopefully what will happen is I will take out a bomb and spin the camera around again and if I could drop the bomb at a specific frame I will hopefully be pushed in the exact value where that one pixel of barrier is missing wow and we get through wow
[302:55.99]Wow!
[302:58.17]And yeah, that is what both a lot of smart people and computers were able to help out with, because it is so ridiculously precise.
[303:07.08]I think people overuse pixel perfect, honestly, in speedrunning sometimes, but that is literally basically pixel perfect, and there are other clips with that same strat that are going to be float value perfect, meaning that
[303:21.05]you couldn't even visually tell the difference, so the setups are gonna be even more precise.
[303:25.89]But thankfully, now once I'm past it, I can get into Ganon's Tower.
[303:29.45]I'm not gonna beat the game, I still have some dungeons left, but getting here early gives me access to a shortcut for later in the game to skip all the endgame cutscenes and some items.
[303:40.49]Now, I have some problems, which is that even though I'm in the end of the game early, there's a lot of stuff that's coming up.
[303:45.93]So here is the Trials.
[303:47.25]This is kind of a staple in Zelda games.
[303:50.26]So all of these have inspired themes from each dungeon, so you kind of go through the main dungeons an extra time, and you have to re-fight the boss.
[303:58.74]And if you do all four of them, you can get through.
[304:01.93]However, that's very slow, and I don't even have the items to beat all those dungeons.
[304:05.79]I haven't even done all of these, right?
[304:07.61]So I'm going to try and do...
[304:10.79]a very precise roll clip here, and this one is a lot worse than the other one, so I need to focus in here, so I need to do a partial ledge clip by timing my leaf very precisely here, and then I'm gonna need to do a frame-perfect roll clip followed up by perfect leaf bumps.
[304:31.13]Just barely...
[304:33.42]Nice.
[304:34.08]First try!
[304:35.52]Oh my god!
[304:37.28]That's insane.
[304:38.92]Now, like I said, five tricks back-to-back.
[304:41.68]So now, I need to unlock a shortcut war.
[304:43.98]This, normally for a cash, will be super easy.
[304:45.78]You have a boomerang, it's a puzzle, you do 3, 1, 4, 2.
[304:49.96]I don't have the boomerang, so I need to use the bow and arrow.
[304:53.75]But, you aim so slowly in this game that you basically don't have time to aim.
[304:57.87]So this setup, to be able to do this with the bow and arrow, requires 8
[305:01.15]frame perfect inputs with the setup.
[305:04.23]So I need to hit basically go here, here, here, and here.
[305:07.89]And I can't do it manually because it's so precise.
[305:10.31]So hopefully I can get all eight of these buffers perfectly.
[305:13.29]So I'm gonna... Oops.
[305:22.15]Okay.
[305:22.33]Oh, come on.
[305:28.68]Pause on the frame early.
[305:32.80]I think it is one input
[305:55.36]I missed, damn it.
[305:57.06]So my initial, I got the frames all the way up until there, but my initial position on this bow shot here must have been slightly off.
[306:03.65]That sucks, that's fine.
[306:07.57]Yeah, this is a very precise trick, and I'm having, this pause timing is slightly different on this TV, but it's gonna be fine.
[306:12.15]We're gonna get it right now.
[306:35.77]Got it.
[306:36.23]Wow.
[306:37.59]Wow.
[306:38.96]Oh, my God.
[306:40.14]That was awesome.
[306:40.94]That's insane.
[306:42.62]Yeah, it's very, very precise.
[306:45.48]However, fun fact, if you play this in HD, this trick becomes trivial because thanks to motion controls, you can do...
[306:51.58]this and technically do it.
[306:53.36]But yeah, on this version, you basically have to pause buffer unless you're a TAS, and the main reason for it, if you're wondering, like, can't you just get better aim linkers and do it?
[307:00.53]The main problem is that not only is it super precise where you need to shoot, but you need to hold, like, angles, so you would need to be able to go from, for example, holding all the way left and on a stick, to all the way right, to all the way left, to down, to up, in, like, singular frames, and you could just not do it that fast with your thumb.
[307:19.55]But now we got that shortcut to go back to the overworld.
[307:22.66]Here's Phantom Gannis Mace.
[307:24.40]Normally, you're supposed to fight him in each one of these rooms, and it kind of points in the right direction.
[307:29.65]But the order is always down, left, up, left, right, up.
[307:33.07]So by just memorizing that, you can get through it.
[307:36.67]Also, at the end here, there's a bonus room, which is a secret, which...
[307:41.32]I don't know why they put it here, because you would have no idea.
[307:43.36]You would have to purposely go the wrong direction in the last room here to find it.
[307:48.04]So it's a very big secret.
[307:49.14]But if you go in here, you can get some rupees, which is going to be needed, because Tingle is very expensive.
[307:54.35]You can see I have to use him quite a lot.
[307:56.57]Get some more equipment here.
[307:59.43]And take some damage.
[308:04.06]Okay.
[308:07.44]Now, I have about a minute of breather here before we get to Forsaken Fortress, which is going to be the hardest part.
[308:16.07]Now, I will actually let the commentators decide.
[308:20.47]So there is a trick coming up in the next era of Forsaken Fortress 2 with chest doors, basically climbing walls and going out of bounds.
[308:34.04]The fastest strat that I would do in a record-based run would require me to do it literally blind.
[308:38.22]The screen turns black.
[308:40.02]You wouldn't see what I'm doing, but it would speed 10 seconds faster.
[308:43.42]Alternatively, you can see what I'm doing, and I would lose 10 seconds.
[308:47.18]So, would you rather see what I'm doing, or would you prefer to just kind of do an honor to the blindfolded and do a very risky strat?
[308:58.92]No pressure.
[308:59.94]I think it's impressive we don't see, but I kind of do want to see what it is.
[309:02.72]I kind of want to see what's going on, too.
[309:06.92]I think it would be cooler to show you can't see, but at the same time, it's such a cool thing if you see it visually.
[309:12.48]Let's see it visually because we want to see how cool it is, but just knowing that you can do it without is crazy.
[309:18.56]That's incredibly impressive.
[309:21.03]So in that case, technically, then there was only, thankfully for me, four.
[309:25.46]Really bad glitches I have to worry about here.
[309:28.57]Ah, yay!
[309:29.31]Alright.
[309:31.77]Yeah, the hardest one is coming up afterwards.
[309:35.37]So we're going to go back to the same words now.
[309:36.75]This is a shortcut that is sort of like a, when you're at the end of the game, you're ready to beat the game.
[309:41.89]If you want to kind of like 100% it, you can use this as a shortcut to get back in and out of the overworld right to the end of the game.
[309:48.28]But by unlocking this early now, I can thankfully use it for later.
[309:52.66]So I'm going to move this boat forward now, since I'm doing the save strat, because I'm actually going to have to talk to him here.
[309:57.98]And here I'm going to fight Phantom Ganon now.
[310:01.40]Now, he is very luck-based.
[310:05.44]This sucks.
[310:06.12]He can either spawn on the ground or spawn in mid-air.
[310:08.18]It's a 50-50% chance.
[310:10.32]You save about, I think, 5 to 10 seconds every time he spawns on the ground, so it's very punishing when you're doing a work-based run.
[310:16.87]Right here, though, I mean...
[310:18.69]The more time, the more time for charity, right?
[310:20.43]So it's fine.
[310:20.95]But let's see how many ground spawns we can get.
[310:22.69]One.
[310:23.21]Good.
[310:24.95]I still never got on a three out of three here, by the way.
[310:27.05]The best I've gotten is a two out of three.
[310:28.64]So if I get three out of three here, I might almost be upset and excited at the same time.
[310:32.40]That's two out of three.
[310:33.66]Let's see.
[310:34.54]Let's go.
[310:36.60]No.
[310:39.29]One day.
[310:40.91]One day will happen.
[310:41.95]One of these days.
[310:44.57]Also, I can't use light arrows on him, if you're curious.
[310:47.19]This is a very custom Phantom Ganon.
[310:49.49]Nintendo tried really hard to not let the sequence break, so they made sure you can only deal damage to him with the Master Sword.
[310:57.01]It didn't work out so great for them, but it was a very good gesture and attempt, at least, to stop us.
[311:03.77]We have a couple of donations.
[311:05.49]We're coming up on a cutscene soon, so you're gonna have to do this first trick.
[311:08.98]Let me know.
[311:09.38]Just let me know.
[311:10.12]So here now, I'm gonna slightly change up the strats so you guys can see what I'm doing.
[311:14.20]So I'm gonna get chest storage here.
[311:15.82]Oops.
[311:19.30]Yeah, so this one is a different way to get storage.
[311:21.38]This one is harder.
[311:22.34]So because there's no ledge I can get it from, I have to walk into a bomb.
[311:25.66]The bomb will push me so I can't clip inside of it.
[311:28.54]And then I have to basically time it perfectly.
[311:31.97]And it's a lot harder.
[311:32.83]And this is the one area on the GameCube version that lags.
[311:35.13]This is why the storage sucks.
[311:36.95]Okay, got it.
[311:37.97]So what we're going to do here is I'm going to store this text.
[311:41.19]This is the bonus step so you can see what I'm doing.
[311:43.44]If I just open up that chest, you wouldn't see anything.
[311:45.46]It would turn pitch black.
[311:46.90]So we're going to have this text box on the screen.
[311:49.90]So the text box instead is what's going to interrupt this chest.
[311:54.99]And now we want to get to the Under Forsaken Fortress, but it takes a while to get there.
[311:59.73]So I'm going to walk up this wall, I'm going to jump to this side, and then I'm going to walk here on this side.
[312:05.55]This is ridiculous.
[312:06.81]We're going to walk up here, get through here, and then this wall looks, yeah, this looks good pretty much too.
[312:14.57]We're going to walk up here, jump straight through this wall because high up the collision is missing, and we are now in Helmrock's Lair.
[312:24.61]And yeah, for context, everything I just did there in a record-based run, I do that with a pitch black screen.
[312:31.08]The only thing I have to slightly help me is the map.
[312:33.38]So that's why I'm saying it's very risky.
[312:36.50]So, yeah.
[312:38.66]We have a little bit of a breather here.
[312:40.02]We have a short cutscene, and then we have the hardest glitch in the run.
[312:43.00]So let's read some donations.
[312:44.79]Calm down.
[312:45.49]Well, I'm going to calm down.
[312:46.51]And then...
[312:48.23]Let's get into it.
[312:48.93]We have a $77 donation from Anonymous, which is huge.
[312:53.33]We have a $25 donation from Linking Boy.
[312:59.63]We have another $7 donation from Do A Keg Stand.
[313:03.08]He wants that keg stand.
[313:04.66]He really wants it.
[313:05.58]What even is a keg stand?
[313:08.10]You drink a shitload of beer, you grab the keg, you stand up, you put your legs to the ceiling, and you drink.
[313:14.34]What?
[313:17.88]If we reach 130,000, Linkus said he would do a keg stand.
[313:22.17]That was true.
[313:22.65]Can I swap the beer to wine?
[313:24.49]I don't drink beer.
[313:25.47]Actually, that might even be worse.
[313:27.25]That would be worse.
[313:31.13]We have a $10 donation from Golden Curse.
[313:33.21]Linkus is godlike.
[313:34.61]Wind Waker was me in my brother's first Zelda game and his favorite series.
[313:37.93]Great work.
[313:39.03]Thank you.
[313:39.99]We got a $77 donation before of Barrier Skip Pog from Genj.
[313:47.94]Arlie with a $77 donation.
[313:51.04]Just saying awesomeness.
[313:52.55]That's what this run is.
[313:54.13]That's huge.
[313:56.71]$17 donation from Hay saying, hey, you guys are really creative with these.
[314:00.59]Nice.
[314:02.73]And a $50 donation from Fritzy.
[314:05.39]Thanks for hosting Fast 50 and helping a great cause.
[314:09.73]We are up to $177.
[314:10.69]How much, sir?
[314:11.33]$177.
[314:11.35]What's the total at?
[314:12.05]$177 individual $7 donations.
[314:13.37]Incredible.
[314:13.71]$7 for Linkus 7.
[314:24.96]Also, yeah, the pirate, by the way, we never spawn him in the game, so he's just going to fly away.
[314:28.50]Burn the witch!
[314:30.48]Burn!
[314:32.27]Oh, yeah, we never got the pirates.
[314:35.09]Now, this is the hardest trick in the game.
[314:37.01]I hope I can get it first try.
[314:40.06]This is the trick that has killed the most runs for me.
[314:44.16]I wish I could say I could do it safely, but there's no safe way to do it.
[314:47.28]I'm gonna say if I fail it since I make a safety save, it's a roughly three minute time loss for each attempt, so hopefully first or second try, because it's quite a big time loss.
[314:59.43]And the reason it's so difficult is not just its precision, but this trick has three glitches in one.
[315:05.73]The skip is so long that it takes two minutes to perform, so there's three tricks in it.
[315:10.74]So, safety save first, and then the first step is the only calm part.
[315:15.52]We're just gonna roll up the tower.
[315:18.42]But once we get to the top, we have a lot of stuff to do.
[315:23.02]Um, my main objective here is to leave this room.
[315:27.40]If I were to save and quit right now, I'd get put back here.
[315:30.00]I had to watch this cutscene for a bunch of complicated internal flags to be set.
[315:34.16]Basically, to avoid it from sequence breaking, I can't watch endgame cutscenes in early game, and the game basically changed that flag.
[315:42.01]So now the game thinks I'm in endgame, and I can start sequence breaking endgame stuff.
[315:46.05]But to get out of here, my only option is go to Hyrule, and that takes minutes.
[315:50.57]So what I'm gonna do instead is basically, um...
[315:56.57]Get out of bounds is my first step.
[315:58.33]So first thing I need to get behind this bird.
[316:00.35]Is he going to peck me?
[316:01.69]Okay, I'm going to take damage from the spikes.
[316:03.51]So the first thing I'm going to do is abuse this trigger.
[316:06.02]So if you see up here, he's here.
[316:07.70]If I go here, he flies up.
[316:09.26]But if I walk in between this trigger, he will just go higher and higher and higher.
[316:12.50]You can see there it delayed him.
[316:13.76]So I need to do a very precise out of bounds clip here by walking back and forth over this trigger right here.
[316:21.39]This is a crazy glitch.
[316:23.97]So this is step number one.
[316:25.43]This is still hard, but it's the easier one because even when he's high up, I need to get a very precise ledge clip to still be pushed out of bounds here.
[316:36.74]But hopefully it goes well.
[316:42.23]Okay, so let's see if I can get it.
[316:43.55]So one corner, right.
[316:45.87]Okay, so that's the first step.
[316:47.39]So that's one out of three.
[316:48.43]So now I'm going to take a little bit of damage.
[316:50.57]I need to be at half the heart.
[316:51.59]I need to be careful here.
[316:53.61]Then for the second part, I need to get to the door while out of bounds, which is easier said than done.
[317:01.31]So I'm going to go right here.
[317:02.51]I'm going to line myself up against this wall and go here.
[317:05.42]Now there's a bunch of invisible walls that will try and push me back into bounds.
[317:08.50]So I'm going to have to do this very carefully.
[317:13.00]Um, so I'm gonna go around here, and I'm still taking out a bounce.
[317:16.22]There's still an invisible wall left of me that's kind of stopping you from normally getting here.
[317:19.96]Um, to get a storage here.
[317:23.67]Okay.
[317:30.41]So, um, now, like I said, we're still in the second part, which is to get to the top of the door.
[317:36.07]This is very easy and can very easily fail.
[317:38.71]Um, so...
[317:41.22]I'm going to hopefully be able to navigate this.
[317:43.58]These collisions I'm about to get to is super glitchy, you're going to see.
[317:46.63]That's why it's so hard, because you're not supposed to go out here.
[317:48.81]So...
[318:24.98]I have a very small ledge to stand on here, so everything I've done up until this point is not to skip the cutscene, but to get on top of this door to set up the cutscene skip.
[318:34.74]My hands are straight up here.
[318:36.20]So, hold on.
[318:44.92]Okay, so now I'm at the top of the door and the setup is done.
[318:48.43]I have to pause for the game and I have a three-frame window, which might sound generous, but I have to, during this, do two perfect inputs in this three-frame window.
[318:55.67]If I miss it, we're going to redo all of that again.
[318:57.51]So let's see if we can get it first try.
[318:58.83]The objective is activate this loading zone, die on the next frame, then void out while the loading zone is taking.
[319:06.96]All three at the same time.
[319:15.84]Okay, let's do this.
[319:22.72]The frame laid on the leaf.
[319:23.81]It didn't work.
[319:24.31]We're going to have to redo it.
[319:25.83]Oh, my God.
[319:26.31]This is incredible.
[319:28.39]Oh, my God.
[319:29.27]That sucks.
[319:29.95]Oh, you got it the second time, though.
[319:31.23]Oh, easy.
[319:31.85]Hopefully a second try, yeah.
[319:33.87]Yeah.
[319:35.23]But if you want, you can reach in the nations while I reset this glitch up.
[319:37.75]I'm sorry.
[319:38.57]It's very hard.
[319:40.19]Like I said, this is where a lot of runs will die.
[319:41.76]It's a very precise trick.
[319:43.10]Every part of it is very...
[319:45.56]Very unforgiving.
[319:46.40]Oh, you're killing it, man.
[319:47.52]Yeah.
[319:48.24]Let's go, Legas.
[319:49.04]It's not easy.
[319:50.02]Yeah.
[319:51.06]It's incredibly intense.
[319:52.24]The fact that you set all that up to get onto the ledge to do the glitch is incredible.
[319:59.55]I'm aghast.
[320:00.41]Flabbergasted.
[320:02.03]The Geep.
[320:03.61]We have a $10 donation from Kawasemi.
[320:08.53]Thanks PointCrow for accurately representing my reaction to Linkus walking on the wall.
[320:13.56]Thank you.
[320:15.04]LinkusFanboy7 with the $25 donation.
[320:20.93]Love your content, Linkus.
[320:22.69]You help me go throughout the day.
[320:24.43]Thank you.
[320:25.05]We have a $20 donation from Anonymous.
[320:27.85]Thanks so much.
[320:28.43]And so many $7 donations from Aiden, from Helgren, Matthew.
[320:35.58]I did?
[320:37.82]I'm so sorry.
[320:39.82]And Chevin.
[320:43.93]Love from the better country in the Scandinavian Peninsula.
[320:50.06]Got some inter-country beef there.
[320:53.26]Got some warring going on.
[320:54.84]It's for charity, so I'm going to accept the comment.
[320:58.94]But grudgingly.
[321:03.87]Astro with the $30 donation.
[321:05.11]Good luck on the rest of your run, Linkus.
[321:07.83]Here's hoping for a second attempt at success.
[321:10.13]You got this.
[321:10.63]Thank you.
[321:12.54]Yeah, after I'm gonna lose glitch, by the way, there's still a lot of tricks left, but this is the last one that can brutally go wrong, thankfully.
[321:18.26]So this is the really big last one that I really have to worry about.
[321:21.30]Um, there is a reason why this run, uh, I set my time estimate a bit over what my PB would be, because there is a lot of these glitches that are just so brutal to do.
[321:31.24]Uh, even just at home, it's already difficult, and then, you know, while doing it live at a run, um...
[321:36.58]Makes it even harder, but yeah, hopefully we get it second try.
[321:39.00]We're in three attempts and I consider it a success, because that's about what I thought in my estimate of around... Because I had about ten minutes to the estimate for this.
[321:55.78]You can keep reading donations until I get to the top.
[321:57.72]Sorry, I'm literally watching.
[322:00.98]Sorry.
[322:03.16]I'm so locked into this.
[322:04.76]I'm mesmerized by this run.
[322:07.68]Yes, we got a $7 donation from MiniMini.
[322:11.14]Good luck, Linkus.
[322:12.35]Yo, shout out to MiniMini.
[322:13.57]He is one of the best Windmaker runners as well.
[322:17.35]He is an amazing guy, and he's helped me tremendously with learning this category when I first picked it up about two years ago.
[322:23.74]So, because this new old dungeons route, this category right here, didn't exist too many years ago because this is like the main glitch that was found that really cemented all dungeons, honestly.
[322:34.39]This glitch I'm doing right here.
[322:36.33]Took quite a while to figure out.
[322:37.77]Let's put it that way.
[322:41.01]Shoutouts to Minnie.
[322:42.15]Incredible runner.
[322:43.77]We have a $10 donation from Jimmy.
[322:46.19]Thank you so much.
[322:49.23]Let's hopefully do this.
[323:23.35]Navy?
[323:25.24]Wait!
[323:51.95]Yes!
[323:54.14]Oh my god!
[323:56.30]Wow!
[323:57.46]Awesome.
[323:58.10]You can see the tetras here.
[323:59.70]I'm in a random room and I'm dying.
[324:01.13]So this is a cutscene to take you to Hyrule 2.
[324:05.43]Now, because you're never supposed to be able to play in this room, the game never sets
[324:10.50]a trigger for where you should respawn if you die there.
[324:13.62]So it defaults to the default location in the game, which is Windfall.
[324:17.46]So it basically teleports me to the back of the overworld.
[324:21.49]Just in case, I don't know, I can save again.
[324:23.73]Okay.
[324:26.73]Save one more time, just in case.
[324:27.61]Yeah, exactly.
[324:28.19]But yeah, we still got plenty of glitches left, but that said, there's no more that can lose me tremendous amounts of time.
[324:34.96]I am so relieved.
[324:36.68]I am so happy right now.
[324:38.96]Yeah!
[324:40.21]Awesome.
[324:40.53]Can I ask, why Windfall as the default position?
[324:45.27]So I slightly actually agree with you.
[324:47.11]You would think it's outset because it's the starting island, but Windfall is technically the one with the most side quests and missions and NPCs.
[324:55.44]So I'm guessing that is why it sets it as default.
[325:00.48]Right here, I don't have the Iron Boot, so I can't get up to this statue.
[325:03.80]Thankfully, the game gives you about a split second before you start sliding when you go up against a strong wind.
[325:09.23]And that timer gets reset when you take out the Wind Waker, so I can kind of buffer my way up to the stone, break it with the Skull Hammer, and get the stone early.
[325:19.37]And now we get a little beautiful song cutscene.
[325:29.73]It's so bizarre seeing how you were just sort of at the end and now you're back here.
[325:35.95]It's like messing with my casual brain.
[325:40.74]My little peon, like... Wait, what are you doing back here?
[325:46.55]Didn't we do this already?
[325:47.41]Can we just talk to Grandma real quick, you know?
[325:51.21]Yeah.
[325:52.07]Are we doing that, by the way?
[325:52.93]Are we saving Grandma?
[325:54.25]We are not.
[325:55.01]You do actually for 100%, but not for this category.
[326:00.54]So, if you play this game, you will be very aware of something called the Triforce Quest.
[326:07.14]If you ever wondered why Twilight Princess has so many dungeons, it is because this game was rushed in the end of development, and they had to scrap two half-completed dungeons, and they were made into Twilight Princess dungeons.
[326:17.66]And to make up the playtime, Nintendo thought, you know what, instead of making more dungeons, let's just take eight pieces of a Triforce, scatter it in the ocean, because they probably like fishing.
[326:28.43]So that's probably the only complaint people have.
[326:30.51]Basically, up until Wind Temple, it's incredible, and then I like it for exploring, but a lot of people don't like the Triforce quest.
[326:36.23]So this whole thing is to make it so that once we're done with the dungeons, we don't basically have to spend an hour sailing around and getting a bunch of Triforce pieces.
[326:44.82]That's really why we're kind of doing this in this strange order.
[326:47.60]It's for that shortcut warp.
[326:50.60]Also, by getting those light arrows early, I am able to one-shot almost every enemy in the game, because it's like the last item you get in the game, and it was made to be overpowered once you beat in the game.
[327:04.63]So by getting that early, you really get a huge advantage.
[327:13.01]Once I'm here, this is like a nice breather.
[327:17.59]We have about another five minutes until we get into Earth Temple, which is when glitches are starting to pick up again.
[327:23.50]I guess I'm super soon, but like, you know, the really crazy stuff.
[327:28.77]So right now I'm kind of just picking up some mandatory stuff.
[327:31.25]I got that wind song, which is necessary to get into
[327:36.24]Wind Temple later on.
[327:37.99]Right now, I'm going to Fire Mountain.
[327:39.69]This is where I get the Power Bracelets, and this is necessary for completing Earth Temple.
[327:46.49]So I'm gonna drown against this island.
[327:47.93]It will respawn me in the boat right next to the island.
[327:51.30]And it's very important, because to enter this island, I need to shoot an Ice Arrow into the lava, which I can only do through a boat.
[328:00.64]That took me forever to figure out casually.
[328:05.20]I don't actually know if the game tells you about it.
[328:09.79]I think it's more of just like,
[328:11.77]Oh, yeah.
[328:12.17]Fire and ice.
[328:13.27]I saw one of the fish in the water.
[328:16.19]I think one of them tells you or something like that.
[328:19.67]I think you can feed... I think his official name is Fishman.
[328:25.99]I think if you feed him Swedish meatballs... Okay, they're called meatballs in the game, but, like, come on.
[328:31.79]He will, in fact, give you hints.
[328:33.71]Fresh from Ikea.
[328:35.07]Yeah.
[328:35.93]I'm going to be honest.
[328:36.57]When I played this game casually, I didn't realize he gave hints.
[328:38.83]I thought he only just gave you more maps, so...
[328:41.80]I never read the text, so it didn't really help me a lot.
[328:45.00]Plus, I couldn't read English when I played this game for the first time, so I had no chance to figure it out either way.
[328:50.96]Two timers on the screen.
[328:53.37]Oh, my God.
[328:53.99]Oh, my God.
[328:54.89]It's a different speed run.
[328:56.01]I only got five minutes to beat this island.
[328:58.33]What are we going to do?
[329:02.01]We have a couple of donations.
[329:03.48]Go right ahead.
[329:04.78]We have a $25 donation from Brandon just about to start a 10-hour drive, and this stream will be great for it.
[329:10.66]Go, Linkus!
[329:11.93]Perfect.
[329:12.89]Good luck.
[329:13.63]Drive safe.
[329:14.65]Don't text and drive.
[329:15.91]We have a $7 donation from Ugu.
[329:18.43]Hello.
[329:19.63]I can't.
[329:20.01]I don't know how to say it.
[329:21.13]How do you do it?
[329:21.64]That was my Australian accent.
[329:23.46]You know?
[329:24.48]Hello.
[329:25.14]I thought you were trying to do like a tingle.
[329:27.52]Hello.
[329:27.80]What a condensation.
[329:30.66]From Australia.
[329:31.66]First time seeing a full Wind Waker run.
[329:33.22]So cool.
[329:33.84]Thank you, Linkus.
[329:35.53]Of course.
[329:36.59]I mean, I guess you do live on an island, so I guess it makes sense.
[329:38.70]Do you like the speedrun?
[329:41.34]And, hey, I can't blame you.
[329:42.22]Hey, it's a great speedrun.
[329:46.52]We have a $13 donation from KeepOnKeepingOn.
[329:53.45]Time is passing.
[329:54.01]You're already here.
[329:54.75]Doing just fine.
[329:56.81]Oh, my God.
[329:57.23]And we have a $98.50 donation from TacFlake.
[330:04.06]Unbelievable talent in this stream.
[330:05.38]Great job, everyone.
[330:06.86]Shout out to the rats.
[330:08.96]Probably from the Spyro stream.
[330:10.83]We have a $7 donation from Thalia.
[330:20.25]This is sick.
[330:22.12]And then a $7 donation from Hingle McCringleberry.
[330:26.66]Thank you so much for that.
[330:29.64]That is a very good username.
[330:31.95]Very interesting.
[330:33.75]It mystifies me so much, but I love them all.
[330:36.27]I really do.
[330:37.39]Yeah.
[330:38.51]So now I'm coming up to Earth Temple.
[330:42.10]So, yeah, I'm just going to move on from that username.
[330:43.92]I don't know what else to say.
[330:45.48]Does Ankle McRinkleberry not do it for you?
[330:47.66]No.
[330:47.98]So normally I'm supposed to watch a long cutscene, get medley here.
[330:50.84]So if you haven't played the game, these two dungeons are special.
[330:54.14]So they're not just normal dungeons.
[330:55.44]You get a companion with you.
[330:56.63]For this one, it's medley.
[330:57.39]For the other one, it's my car.
[330:58.79]Now you can technically, with some very precise glitches, skip this dungeon, or the skip medley.
[331:05.67]So this is the new trick, and this is so I can get inside of here without medley to break the songstone, and this one is float perfect, so it is much more precise than barrier skip.
[331:18.37]Hopefully we can get this first try.
[331:20.43]So I'm gonna do this setup to get this very specific facing value.
[331:26.75]Then what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna jump slash into this corner to get a position.
[331:31.56]Then I do a frame perfect backflip.
[331:34.06]Then I need to crawl.
[331:35.66]Stand up, interrupt the crawl.
[331:37.58]Slash twice, frame perfectly.
[331:39.04]Blow the leaf three times.
[331:42.62]It seems random, trust me.
[331:43.90]We're getting in a specific float here.
[331:45.57]Then I'm gonna roll four times.
[331:49.06]Then I'm going to C up.
[331:50.10]I'm going to look left for eight frames.
[331:53.62]One more frame.
[331:56.28]Yep.
[331:56.98]Now I have to pause on a specific frame while I hold a bomb and then frame perfectly drop it.
[332:01.54]And if I did the setup correctly and I get that timing right, we will hopefully click through the wall.
[332:13.73]Got it.
[332:14.69]Wow.
[332:15.73]Alright.
[332:17.51]Dude, I half expected you to bake a batch of cookies during that setup.
[332:20.95]Oh my god.
[332:21.59]That was like a recipe.
[332:24.32]Add a pound of flour here, a couple eggs.
[332:26.52]Yeah.
[332:27.12]It takes a while to learn that setup, I'm going to be honest, because
[332:31.87]It really didn't make a lot of sense for the first few days of trying to learn it.
[332:35.28]And I don't know if you could tell, but it's kind of a dark room, so there's not very good visuals to know you did it right.
[332:40.78]So you just have to grind it enough to get a feel for it.
[332:44.36]Right here, we are coming up on my favorite dungeon.
[332:47.43]This is going to be so much fun, chat.
[332:50.77]So I'm gonna safety save just in case, and then we're gonna connect the Tingle Tuner, and this guy will be with us for the entire rest of the run, so say welcome and hello back for Tingle.
[332:59.57]So we're gonna take the Tingle Tuner, it's gonna take about 20 seconds, and then we're gonna get into this dungeon.
[333:04.70]So...
[333:06.36]Like I said, normally you're supposed to bring Medli along here, and the first issue we have is literally the first room.
[333:11.64]So you're gonna see there's gonna be two pillars in this first room.
[333:14.00]You're supposed to take Medli, put her on one switch, fly to the other switch, you can see here these two pillars here, and get through it that way.
[333:21.25]However, like I said, I don't have Medli, so I need to get creative.
[333:24.51]So what I'm gonna do here is I am going to, and I hope I get this right, because I have to deal with an enemy here, and he can be very trolly.
[333:32.41]So I'm gonna lure this guy up here.
[333:33.82]Then I need audio here.
[333:36.68]to get him a little bit higher up here.
[333:40.00]Hey, buddy.
[333:41.00]You doing okay?
[333:42.40]Hey, buddy.
[333:43.62]Hey, buddy.
[333:53.00]Okay.
[333:53.66]So I'm going to freeze him.
[333:54.66]I'm going to walk across the air.
[333:55.78]I'm going to throw him.
[333:57.56]Side up to get up.
[333:58.74]I'm going to freeze him again.
[334:01.44]Put him on the switch.
[334:02.78]And if I do this perfectly, the sleeping section here, he will unfreeze right as I stand on the switch.
[334:08.26]But because he's still technically on it.
[334:10.98]Oh, that's so creative.
[334:13.42]Wow.
[334:14.66]Oh, that's such cool routing.
[334:16.88]Wow.
[334:18.91]Then here I run into the second issue.
[334:20.25]So normally here, you would have a medley or a mirror shield to be able to kill these chews here.
[334:27.00]However, since I got light arrows early and they can one-hit any enemy, I can just shoot them and instantly kill them, which is why for certain areas here, the light arrows are essential for the route.
[334:39.61]and then I'm gonna take that guy down, get this magic, and then we're coming on to the crazy part of the route.
[334:46.07]So like I said, this is my favorite dungeon.
[334:47.39]It's so cool to do speedrun-wise.
[334:48.74]I'm gonna do a safety save here, because I have to nail everything here for the rest of this dungeon perfectly, but it'll be fine.
[334:55.00]So I'm gonna get storage, and here is a new example of storage, actually.
[334:58.44]So what I'm gonna do is I need to get out of bounds here.
[335:01.49]So I'm gonna store opening up this door, open up this door,
[335:04.13]It's going to kind of be confused by which area it should load.
[335:06.75]So it put me here, unload this room, load the next one.
[335:09.81]I fall underneath the map, and then I can just leave to this downstairs corridor that is blocked by the staircase.
[335:17.23]You can see that I'm going through it.
[335:21.53]That was a great sound effect.
[335:22.53]Beautiful.
[335:23.17]Thank you.
[335:24.87]And we're now in the basement.
[335:26.83]Now, you can see there's a lot of these songstones.
[335:28.83]The game really wants to make sure you bring Medley along.
[335:31.83]So the shenanigans of getting around Medley is not done yet.
[335:35.53]So here I'm going to get storage.
[335:38.95]I'm going to run through here.
[335:41.27]I'm going to store this text box to turn invisible.
[335:46.95]Then I'm going to head over here.
[335:52.14]I'm going to spawn a secret chest with a Tingle Bomb.
[335:55.96]That will activate a text box from the invisible state I got.
[336:00.71]Then I can get chest storage by canceling that little chest right there, so now I can walk up walls again.
[336:08.66]And now, I need to make sure that I get everything, because if I fall down, I will lose my chest storage, and we're having a bad time.
[336:18.48]So first, I need to talk to Tingle here.
[336:20.36]I'm not going to do this with my nose right now for this marathon run.
[336:22.77]Hello, Tingle.
[336:23.87]I'm going to equip that.
[336:25.35]So now here, I'm going to have to be very precise out of bounds, because I don't have any height to get around this.
[336:30.41]So this is very precise.
[336:31.99]So I'm going to have to do a...
[336:40.93]It's fine.
[336:41.58]We made a safety save.
[336:42.62]It's only one minute.
[336:44.30]So what I have to do right there is I basically... So that leaf bump trick I mentioned that you basically take away in and out the leaf.
[336:49.20]I have to do that, but I have to do it three times perfectly.
[336:52.22]Because you can see I'm literally at the height.
[336:54.22]So I'm actually basically under the door, but I'm clipping back up.
[336:59.65]And that is what I have to do.
[337:01.31]If this was another route, I could just get another chest door to continue.
[337:04.99]But on this run, unfortunately, I can't.
[337:06.59]But since I made that safety save, we will get right back to it, thankfully.
[337:09.52]So...
[337:10.12]We don't really have to worry about it.
[337:14.50]While I'm just getting back there, do you want to read a donation or two since it will just take a minute?
[337:18.82]It's the perfect time for you to take a donation.
[337:20.74]We just got a $77 donation from Dap.
[337:25.03]Linkus has been my favorite part of Fast 50 so far.
[337:27.73]His tech is incredible.
[337:30.23]Thank you.
[337:32.87]We got a $7 nation from she's seven on my seven till I seven.
[337:38.24]Love that.
[337:40.24]As seven does.
[337:40.94]As seven does.
[337:44.30]We have a $10 nation from Person Man.
[337:46.86]Looking forward to watching the Swedish sniper destroy Ganon.
[337:51.29]Thank you.
[337:52.79]We got a $6 donation from Vitorim.
[337:56.67]Thank you so much.
[337:59.13]We have a donation from Kungle McFungle Jungle.
[338:03.69]Thank you very much for that.
[338:06.29]There was a donation from Grandma earlier.
[338:09.29]Yes.
[338:09.65]Oh, my God.
[338:09.97]I did miss it.
[338:10.61]There was a donation from Grandma, and I remember what it said.
[338:14.58]It was, my disappointment is immeasurable.
[338:18.24]What's the line?
[338:19.36]My...
[338:22.53]My disappointment is immeasurable.
[338:24.05]And my day is ruined.
[338:25.03]There it is.
[338:25.59]And my day is ruined because you were not saving Grandma.
[338:29.83]And then we got one more.
[338:31.69]We'll end with the $25 donation.
[338:34.57]Wait, so what was storage again?
[338:36.47]I confuse the game very much.
[338:43.96]And it does funky stuff.
[338:49.21]Thank you guys so much for the donations.
[338:50.43]We're almost at $125,000 for charity.
[338:53.98]Let's keep it up.
[338:55.68]Keep it up.
[338:56.22]About to cross it.
[338:56.86]124.939 right now.
[338:57.52]We are 177 away.
[339:04.93]This is so cool.
[339:08.17]Yeah, this is always a little bit nerve-wrecking, but it's coming along.
[339:13.84]Is that the first time you turned invisible?
[339:15.60]Yes.
[339:16.18]Okay.
[339:18.34]That part is a little confusing, but then again, all of this is quite... This isn't the Wind Waker I remember.
[339:25.74]Wait, you guys haven't been keeping up fully?
[339:28.31]I'm starting to get it, though.
[339:29.53]Nice.
[339:30.43]I'm starting to figure it out.
[339:31.83]I don't know.
[339:32.32]I can't tell because I haven't really spoken with you much before.
[339:35.60]I can't tell if you're sarcastic or not, but I'm really going to believe you.
[339:40.38]The storage and the positive and the negative state.
[339:45.09]I'm starting to get it.
[339:46.37]I'm so proud.
[339:47.09]You're very good at explaining this.
[339:49.81]Let's not fail this again.
[339:51.53]You broke it down very well.
[340:00.84]Oh, you got it!
[340:01.70]Let's go!
[340:02.88]Okay, now here I'm going to see if RNG is nice to me.
[340:09.72]It is nicer since it's a marathon run to not be so risky that it could be magic.
[340:13.52]Thank you.
[340:14.20]Normally, I would just basically assume good RNG here.
[340:17.84]Let's die for this run.
[340:19.36]So I'm going to get that one right there.
[340:21.42]That's a backup one.
[340:22.72]Here I need to listen to the Game Boy Advance.
[340:24.44]So here I'm going to do a really cool out-of-bounds strat that's going to combine Tingle Balloon and out-of-bounds.
[340:31.50]So by clipping out of bounds here, I will use it to run out of bounds.
[340:40.65]And then I'm going to come to the side here, go into the door, and open it.
[340:46.75]Beautiful.
[340:47.33]Alright.
[340:47.59]Nice.
[340:49.19]And we just crossed $125,000.
[340:49.93]Alright.
[340:50.31]Awesome.
[340:50.51]Let's keep it up.
[340:56.06]Um, yeah, also, I forgot to mention this, but, um, I know I brought about it earlier that you have a shrink hitbox when you have chest storage enabled.
[341:03.54]So what that does when you go against a ledge like this is because I'm so far into the ledge, if I walk off slowly, Link is more than 50% out of bounds.
[341:13.72]So when you climb up, he just falls out of bounds.
[341:16.08]So that's how I'm able to do all of these out of bounds skips.
[341:18.79]Um, I kind of brushed over that.
[341:21.09]So that's how I'm kind of just, like, randomly walking off a ledge, like, right here, and then...
[341:25.33]You know, he just climbs back up and I'm back out of bounds.
[341:27.81]Did you glitch out the background music?
[341:30.29]Oh, yeah.
[341:31.60]So this specific chest breaks the background song, so there is no sound until I enter the boss room.
[341:38.26]You're really silent.
[341:39.32]Yeah, that is jarring.
[341:41.69]I kind of want to say, though, that it makes it even more intense.
[341:46.01]You're like, really?
[341:46.83]And like a record-paced run.
[341:48.31]You're even more nerve-wracking right here because there's no sound, so you're like, oh, God.
[341:52.08]You hear the sound of your heartbeat?
[341:53.72]Yeah.
[341:54.22]Exactly.
[341:56.79]Flip out of bounds, fly around here.
[341:59.69]You're killing it with these clips.
[342:01.84]Yeah, honestly, except for falling down that one time, the rest went perfectly.
[342:05.61]Now I'm finally at the end of the dungeon.
[342:07.59]I'm supposed to go down and get the boss key.
[342:09.85]I'm not going to do that.
[342:10.75]I'm not going to get any boss keys, for that matter.
[342:13.19]They stink.
[342:14.09]So I'm going to do a very advanced technique called a backflip.
[342:19.18]So what I'm going to do is I'm going to stand here, and I'm going to backflip with Link and go out of bounds.
[342:27.82]Oh, my God.
[342:30.35]And we're through.
[342:31.31]Easy.
[342:31.45]Just do that.
[342:32.29]And that's the dungeon.
[342:33.15]Now you guys have the boss left.
[342:36.93]Yeah.
[342:38.07]Now for this boss fight, here is a little cool fun fact.
[342:41.16]So normally the dungeon item you get here is the mirror shield.
[342:44.44]You're supposed to use these kind of lights that shine in, shine on this boss, he turns visible, and he's vulnerable.
[342:51.52]But because of the rushed development and the scrapping dungeons, there is a beta feature left in the game, which you would never know without coaches.
[342:59.73]Where?
[343:00.69]He is vulnerable to light arrows because it was not supposed to be in the location it was.
[343:05.90]So that left in beta feature lets us actually damage him.
[343:09.54]And if that was not left in, this route would not work.
[343:12.57]That's a crazy oversight.
[343:17.92]So thank you for leaving that in, Nintendo.
[343:19.78]I heavily appreciate it.
[343:22.40]For this fight, there's no way to do it faster than three cycles, basically.
[343:25.67]After you kill five posts, he will call them back in, and you just have to kind of take him down.
[343:36.12]I'm also dropping some bombs, by the way, because it's RNG where they go.
[343:39.14]So sometimes they spread out so that it's slower for me to kill them with my sword, like here.
[343:44.46]And then hopefully the bombs get to at least one or two of them.
[343:47.12]Just kind of to cover some of our area.
[344:08.91]Very well done.
[344:09.43]Nice!
[344:10.37]That was a good boss fight.
[344:15.04]After this cutscene, I'm going to take some damage for a later trick, and then just basically watch the cutscene with Medley.
[344:22.97]I don't know.
[344:24.21]She'll learn how to do all the glitches as well.
[344:25.65]She'll just show up here.
[344:26.55]Don't question it.
[344:29.15]So, yeah, this is a great time to rate some donations.
[344:33.39]We have a little downtime here for the last dungeon of the run.
[344:37.68]We have a $100 donation from Kevin.
[344:43.76]That's it.
[344:45.18]Thank you, Kevin.
[344:46.26]Alright, Kevin.
[344:47.06]Yeah.
[344:48.76]We have a $10 donation from Grandpa.
[344:51.83]My awe is immeasurable and my day has been made.
[344:53.93]Let's queue up the good work for charity.
[344:56.03]That's awesome.
[344:58.13]Thank you.
[345:00.57]And we have a $34 donation from Noah and Amanda.
[345:03.92]It's the donation that actually put us to 125,000.
[345:06.04]125,000.
[345:06.06]Baby, let's go.
[345:15.76]It's crazy.
[345:16.72]We did cross over 200 individual $7 donations.
[345:20.61]So thank you guys for that $7 donation.
[345:22.39]That was crazy.
[345:25.09]We appreciate y'all.
[345:26.17]We're currently at 206.
[345:27.37]Yeah.
[345:27.55]And for anyone in North America, by the way, watching this, especially thanks.
[345:34.19]I know this run is very late, so anyone who stayed up, I appreciate it.
[345:36.83]Anyone who woke up as well early in Europe, thank you everybody so much for watching at home.
[345:40.11]We really appreciate y'all and everyone in the room.
[345:43.15]Well, we have another $100 donation.
[345:44.99]Keep those claps going.
[345:49.24]From Sue, Linkus was the one that got me into watching speed runs.
[345:53.19]I love seeing how this run developed.
[345:55.98]Yeah, if you haven't seen Wind Waker for the past two years, this is very different from what you might remember.
[346:01.69]This is why I kind of came back to the grind.
[346:05.67]I've decided that this is going to be my last official major or record grind, so I'm playing this four or five days a week, and I'll hopefully, within a month or two, be able to get... I'm currently third place.
[346:15.76]We have another four minutes to go, which might sound like a lot, but that's basically us not messing up two tricks, technically, but easier said than done.
[346:23.50]So, yeah, if you...
[346:26.42]If you want to see the grind, feel free to join the journey.
[346:29.88]What is the record right now?
[346:31.50]So, I almost don't want to say because we're going to be very far off on this run, but the record would be a 2 hour and 20 minutes time.
[346:39.97]Wow.
[346:40.61]So we're going to be a bit off here.
[346:42.51]I am automatically losing some time, so I guess I can mention it because we're not doing it.
[346:46.74]So one thing that sucks about this run is not only, I'm sure you've seen, is it very difficult.
[346:53.44]Five minutes before the end of the run, there is a glitch known as Puppet Cannon Skip.
[346:58.00]It is entirely RNG-based.
[346:59.84]There is a one in three chance that it works, and every time you don't get it, you lose two minutes.
[347:05.59]So to get a record, you have to play this entire game for two and a half hours perfectly, and then you have to get a one in three chance luck-based element, or you lost the entire run.
[347:15.99]Oh my god.
[347:17.65]So it is very brutal.
[347:18.93]So I'm not even attempting that skip because they can take an infinite amount of attempts to get it.
[347:24.86]And I mean, I've been home where it takes me 15 minutes to get it once.
[347:28.90]So because of that, for this marathon run, I am not doing the pop again and skip route.
[347:33.80]So we're automatically losing around five, seven minutes not doing that.
[347:38.28]But I would rather show off a cool fight and guarantee that I can finish this run than rely on luck.
[347:44.79]One and three might sound like a lot, but trust me, landing that two and three is quite frequent.
[347:50.51]Brutal.
[347:52.81]But...
[347:53.74]Well, it's 67%, right?
[347:55.70]That you're not going to do it.
[347:58.28]66.66, repeating, of course.
[348:00.91]Exactly.
[348:01.35]Yeah, I think my record is like center 11 attempts, I think.
[348:10.06]Yikes.
[348:11.46]It's atrocious luck.
[348:12.76]Yeah.
[348:14.64]Or buy a lottery ticket, whichever one you want to look at.
[348:17.24]Exactly.
[348:17.76]Oh, cool.
[348:18.74]I actually have to pause here because I'm going to lose some rupees otherwise.
[348:22.21]So I'm buying a Tingle Balloon in the background here, by the way, on the Game Boy Advance.
[348:26.07]but I'm on a timer.
[348:27.39]It takes 10 seconds from when you buy something to when it kicks in.
[348:30.05]So by getting hit there on that bomb, I need to activate right there so I can run through here.
[348:34.45]I can't believe they just let you do that.
[348:37.63]Yeah, it's crazy to me that this is just an intended mechanic.
[348:40.81]Like, that's not a glitch.
[348:41.75]That's just, oh, 30 rupees and you have an adapter?
[348:44.23]Go right ahead.
[348:44.91]It's like the old version of an amiibo, but even more overpowered.
[348:50.60]We have a $70 donation from Luke Skywalker.
[348:55.27]I was about to go to bed, but when I saw Linkus, I cracked a Red Bull.
[348:58.88]It's 2.30 a.m.
[348:59.34]here, and I'm having a blast.
[349:03.08]Linkus is actually one of the first speedruns I ever watched during another marathon speedrun.
[349:09.16]He was playing Wind Waker, and I was just absolutely enamored by the run.
[349:12.05]It has been lost to time, but it was early to mid 2010s.
[349:19.23]I did not actually know that.
[349:20.95]Oh, no way.
[349:21.71]Yeah, I did not know that.
[349:23.19]That's awesome.
[349:23.81]Yeah.
[349:24.61]And then also there throughout the barrier skip days.
[349:31.49]And nay, I held the shield.
[349:34.77]A lot of these runs, first time I've ever seen them, and they're ridiculous.
[349:40.83]Speedruns, they're crazy.
[349:43.16]They're absolutely insane.
[349:44.92]Yeah.
[349:45.68]Even though I love this game, and if, um,
[349:49.96]I will say, I don't recommend anyone to actually pick this game up unless you're just willing to be miserable for at least two months.
[349:58.70]Because it will take you so long.
[349:59.76]You're really selling it.
[350:00.54]You're really selling it.
[350:01.32]I'm just saying, so if you are like me, where you're like, you know what, I want to just, like, not get a single run for two months, but after two months I'll have fun, do this game.
[350:10.09]It's like get to the third episode and it might hit, you know?
[350:13.59]But it's like two months after.
[350:14.85]Yeah.
[350:15.63]Well, I said this on stream before and I really mean it.
[350:17.75]I am happy that I picked this game up around 2013, 2014, because even though there was glitches at the time, there weren't as many glitches, right?
[350:26.42]So I slowly got forced to introduce myself to more glitches.
[350:31.12]Also, this loading zone is glitched.
[350:32.40]This is literally an intended mechanic to swing in here, but sometimes you just don't hit the loading zone.
[350:38.00]It's great.
[350:38.90]They made it better in the next version because that's how it's supposed to work.
[350:43.41]Because I learned it so long ago, there wasn't as many glitches to learn.
[350:46.61]And then every few months, a new trick was learned, and I just had to learn that one.
[350:51.15]I think the difficulty I picked in this game up now, and why I don't even know if I would if I had to start now,
[350:56.55]is that it's just so overwhelming.
[350:58.59]Like, I feel like it would just be such a daunting task to be like, alright, let's learn 200 different tricks.
[351:04.72]I don't know, by the way, if you mess up one of them, your run is either dead or you lose enormous amounts of time.
[351:13.44]That's top-level speedruns for you.
[351:15.02]Yeah.
[351:16.51]It's very impressive.
[351:17.77]It's, like, really impressive.
[351:19.37]Oh, it's so satisfying when you see someone do it.
[351:22.45]I can't imagine actually doing it yourself.
[351:24.73]Right, yeah.
[351:25.27]Yeah.
[351:26.38]That being said, to not absolutely discourage anyone from learning this game, the community did realize that this game is too hard.
[351:34.35]So they made a new Any% No Manual Supersim, it's called.
[351:38.87]It bans Manual Supersim, it bans Puppet Ganon Skip, and it has a beginner-friendly route.
[351:44.35]So even though it is still difficult, that category is genuinely really fun, really entertaining, and is feasible to pick up.
[351:52.40]So if you want to learn this, there is a lot of tutorials and help out there to learn that category, and it is definitely what I would recommend you to start off with if you want to check this game out.
[352:01.41]We got a $10 donation from Abby Bagel.
[352:03.79]Lincoln says, don't pick this game up.
[352:05.57]That's how a pro keeps his record safe.
[352:09.31]That's not what I meant.
[352:10.40]It's the only way.
[352:11.70]It's the gambit.
[352:14.34]here.
[352:15.70]I need to look at a specific camera angle there when I'm jumping in here.
[352:21.24]I'm going to super swim here to hopefully across the entire ocean again.
[352:29.48]So I need to do another Tingle Balloon super swim, and they are quite precise.
[352:33.24]So hopefully this goes well.
[352:36.86]And also, by the way, if you're wondering why I keep taking off my headset, it's just that the speaker is not that loud on the Game Boy Advance, if you know what I mean.
[352:43.98]I'm still blown away that he uses a Game Boy Advance during the run.
[352:53.75]Yeah, when you pulled it out, I thought it was a joke.
[352:56.55]I was like, oh, this is wicked funny.
[352:58.85]No, oh, that's part of it.
[353:00.29]Oh, shoot, okay.
[353:01.33]I got to put you on the Paper Mario speedruns.
[353:03.99]They use Ocarina of Time halfway through the run.
[353:07.25]Really?
[353:07.49]To complete the run, yeah.
[353:09.17]Yeah.
[353:09.83]What?
[353:10.35]They get to a point in Mario, they hot-swap the game, they write code in Ocarina of Time, and then they hot-swap it back.
[353:20.29]What?
[353:20.85]And the memory is still loaded in RAM.
[353:23.13]And they can just run it in Paper Mario.
[353:26.81]Yes.
[353:27.35]On the original Nintendo 64 launch model, the console can store memory in RAM for 10 seconds before it's cleared.
[353:35.61]So what you can do is you can take awkward enough time, set up what's called arbitrary code execution.
[353:40.21]Write specific lines of code to specific parts of memory that's stored on the RAM of the console.
[353:45.30]Then while... Please don't try this at home.
[353:47.14]This can really damage your cartridge.
[353:48.86]While it's plugged on, turned on, and the game is physically running, you jank the cartridge out and smash in very quickly the Paper Mario cartridge.
[353:58.44]That will start Paper Mario, but it did not clear out all of that memory that was stored in the RAM.
[354:04.98]And that lets you transfer that code you set up to teleport yourself to the credits and beat Paper Mario in like... I think it's 20-30 minutes.
[354:13.94]Phenomenal.
[354:15.26]Wow.
[354:16.04]It's very incredible.
[354:17.02]As a matter of fact, a little cool fun fact, if you have ever checked out Banjo-Kazooie, if you ever 100% that game on the N64, they actually tell you about a feature called Stop and Swap.
[354:25.51]Rare was actually planning to use this kind of oversight on the Nintendo 64 on purpose.
[354:30.03]It was really cool where if you bought a Rare game, you could unlock things and then transfer it to other games to reward you for playing multiple Rare titles.
[354:38.54]So in Banjo-Kazooie, there's a bunch of features that went unused because after they released the first game, Nintendo released a revision of the Nintendo 64
[354:47.26]which only stores things in RAM for one second, and that would be such a short amount of time that there were scared people would be ruining their Nintendo 64s, their cartridges, and, you know, lawsuits were coming in.
[354:57.91]So it was unfortunately never fully implemented, but it's a really cool little fun side history.
[355:03.44]Yeah, but that's where the idea came from for Paper Mario speedruns.
[355:06.24]Yep.
[355:06.66]To use Zelda.
[355:08.32]So cool.
[355:10.60]The creativity in the speedrun community is just insane.
[355:14.65]Also, right here, I know it looks like I'm really hurting the car, but I'm just doing it so that it can fly across the room there.
[355:19.62]What?
[355:23.18]So I pick up my car on the same frame that he took damage from a bomb, and when that happens, the game is trying to, like, perform the kind of recoil.
[355:34.44]You know when you get hit, you go, ah, and fall back a bit?
[355:37.20]So the game is constantly trying to perform that, but it's not able to because I'm holding him.
[355:40.84]And the longer I hold him, the more speed he's charging up.
[355:44.20]So after about three damage animations worth, he can make it across the entire room by just throwing him, and that lets me skip the first room.
[355:53.41]Um,
[355:54.78]And you might be wondering why we don't skip Makar.
[355:58.62]The only reason we don't skip Makar is because of literally these trees right here.
[356:03.46]There is no... If you go to an area that's unloaded, there's no loading zones.
[356:07.48]You can't go to the boss, like Ocarina of Time.
[356:09.86]You have to physically open doors in this game.
[356:12.24]I know it sucks, but... Imagine that.
[356:14.82]Brother!
[356:15.44]That's why we can only go out of bounds to enter boss rooms, because boss rooms and mini boss rooms are the only places that have a loading zone.
[356:22.40]All the other stuff, you need to open the door physically.
[356:26.95]So because of that, we're going to bring Makar here, and we're going to unlock these trees.
[356:32.51]Once I've planted this tree, though, Makar is completely useless, and we will not use him again until the end of the run.
[356:38.50]Hey, he's useful in my heart.
[356:41.10]That is true.
[356:41.48]I love Makar.
[356:43.80]Sorry, chat, by the way.
[356:45.50]Okay.
[356:53.67]Now, I want to get to the end of this dungeon as quickly as possible.
[356:57.37]However, I would need to rescue my car and do a lot of things to get down there.
[357:02.14]So, I'm going to do my last zombie hover for the run so that I can do a ledge clip.
[357:07.46]So...
[357:10.77]For safety, because it's a marathon run, I'm just going to shoot this Warp Pod.
[357:14.91]This is technically optional in this category, but it's a very precise shot.
[357:19.25]Sorry, let me land this up.
[357:20.31]I think that's the right angle.
[357:22.99]Slightly down.
[357:32.62]It hit.
[357:36.02]It's hitting it.
[357:37.64]I love GameCube here.
[357:38.58]So the potlets are kind of broken on GameCube.
[357:40.50]They fixed it on HD.
[357:43.58]There we go.
[357:44.06]Okay.
[357:44.78]So I'm going to unlock that Warpot just in case, but I'm going to do the fast route.
[357:48.97]So what we're going to do is I'm going to activate a heal.
[357:50.71]I'm going to go down to CRHB.
[357:58.06]Hover over this door.
[358:01.79]And now while I'm up here, I can grab this ledge, roll on the burst frame, clip out of bounds, and, um... I can't
[358:17.08]thank you and there we go and uh yeah and that lets me get out of bounds and you see this door right here so this is actually a fail safe the game has to be abused so you see that's the mini boss room but by flying over it it activates the boss room so to avoid you from going out of bounds the game has a feature where if you're ever leafing above a loading zone it will always activate and the intention with that was well if you have a door here with a loading zone if you just
[358:41.79]Jump and leaf you can get past that and fall out of bounds But that can be used to our advantage right there, but just flying over it and it teleports us to it So once again, thank you Right here, I'm gonna this guy That guy
[359:09.99]That happened way too fast, by the way.
[359:12.65]Sorry.
[359:14.55]Also, if you wanted to know how it would have looked like, if I would have done that glitch earlier where I can't see my climb in Forsaken Fortress, it would look like this.
[359:24.06]So right here I clip out of bounds, enter the loading zone, and skip the animation of opening up the hookshot to save 10 seconds.
[359:38.31]Now here, I only basically need one small key and chest storage to be able to beat the rest of this dungeon.
[359:44.61]So I'm going to cause another chest to spawn in here.
[359:47.49]So there is one chest you get as a reward here if you go down these five floors.
[359:51.42]Each time you break one of these floors, a wave of enemies spawn down below me here.
[359:55.86]However, if I'm at the very edge and I perform a jump slash, I can avoid falling down.
[360:01.56]Now if I do that multiple times, I can stay up here and not have to fight any of them, except for the last ones.
[360:07.22]For this last one,
[360:08.42]you don't get the frame because I cut some play of the chest spawning so I'm going to place a bomb as it explodes slightly too late I'm going to try and equip the iron boots and get exploded forward with a knockback there we go so it's going to knock me forward you can hear enemies literally in the background there down there
[360:31.84]So we get the second chest.
[360:33.12]Now, instead of going down like we should, we're going to bomb boost up on this ledge.
[360:36.83]You can stand at the very edge of this.
[360:38.71]And because I just took damage, the tank can't take damage again, so I can just jump over the spikes, no problem.
[360:43.71]Wow.
[360:44.47]No explosion sound either.
[360:45.83]Yeah, it's kind of messed up because of...
[360:52.78]This chest glitch I just did in the previous room.
[360:55.96]And we're also about to lose the music too, actually.
[360:59.54]Eerily.
[361:03.58]And light, you know?
[361:05.14]That comes back when we go in here, don't worry.
[361:07.36]I'll turn the lights back on.
[361:08.02]You can still see the bugs.
[361:09.36]Oh, right.
[361:09.76]That's important.
[361:12.23]And the reason I want to get chest storage is because this design of a door is very flawed, thankfully.
[361:17.40]So you can see, if I just slowly walk into this corner with chest storage, it kind of just makes us walk through.
[361:22.08]And that can be used on every door because this is the same door they use for every one reused.
[361:28.42]So thank you, Nintendo, for making our life easy.
[361:32.11]So right here, I'm going to hookshot my way up to the top.
[361:37.69]Target.
[361:38.05]Go here.
[361:42.82]Okay, now I have to be careful because if I accidentally fall down here, I'm going to be kind of stuck.
[361:48.29]But hopefully I'm good because when I'm in the state, I cannot interact with things like I normally should.
[361:53.37]So I, for example, cannot climb vines.
[361:55.91]I can't climb ledges.
[361:57.73]So to get through this wind right here, I'm going to fly and land on top of this fan.
[362:04.66]What?
[362:05.68]And then I'm going to slash my sword to get to the edge, line myself up here, jump slash up on this one, and then jump around.
[362:14.33]Oh, that's so cool.
[362:17.77]What a strategy.
[362:21.19]Then we'll get through here.
[362:22.33]It's so quiet.
[362:24.87]I could hear every sound in this room and everyone is just pause jumping right now, just like staring at the screen.
[362:30.70]So it's just like complete another silence.
[362:32.68]Well, we do have some donations.
[362:36.00]Jimmerdan with the $5 donation.
[362:38.90]Goated.
[362:40.80]Anita with the $10.39 donation.
[362:44.50]Sorry, I just jumped through that song.
[362:48.80]Also, the boss door.
[362:49.84]Funnily enough, they took the same door design and just scaled it up.
[362:52.83]So same exploit works to get through it.
[362:57.59]Yeah, thank you, Mogera.
[363:00.06]Now, here is the boss for the dungeon.
[363:02.80]This is Philemon Chackinstar Jamming.
[363:05.40]We're just going to have a jam party in the chat.
[363:07.16]This is the best boss muke, in my opinion, in the game, so just enjoy the show.
[363:11.21]We're just going to fight him kind of normally.
[363:17.27]So this is like a playthrough part of the speedrun?
[363:20.94]Exactly, yeah.
[363:21.92]Okay, okay.
[363:22.72]Cool, cool, cool.
[363:23.86]Yeah, there is a crazy strategy you can do that saves a little bit of time.
[363:27.46]It's not worth it for a run like this, where you can stunlock him, but if done perfectly, it saves so little time that for a run like this, it is absolutely not worth it.
[363:37.93]I would only do that in a record-based run.
[363:42.04]We have a $50 donation from Anonymous waking up to a Linkus speedrun.
[363:47.28]Nice.
[363:48.38]Well, good morning.
[363:55.50]Now, for Mulgera, I also actually have to be careful because I'm playing in the Japanese version, and believe it or not, your team can crash when you beat Mulgera without the use of glitches.
[364:08.58]so mulgara every time you attack him spawns these kind of mini works and they make a lot of sound effects and if there's too many sound effects that plays at the same time as you deal the last hit on mulgara your game just straight up will crash uh so I'm gonna have to be careful to be far away from these guys so they don't do too many sound effects try and kill some of them and not quick spin because I want to minimize the amount of sound effects as possible
[364:41.38]Uh, thankfully, by the way, his hitbox is still active when he's flying in the air.
[364:45.72]So, I, oh, he came from an up angle, I couldn't do it.
[364:48.59]Uh, if he does not come from a straight up angle, what you can do there is you can, um, actually hookshot him while he's in the air.
[364:56.59]I'm gonna quickly just pick up these hearts, because I am not risking this.
[364:59.47]Okay.
[365:07.96]Okay.
[365:09.28]One more phase.
[365:09.96]He's four phase.
[365:10.84]It's three hits and then he starts the next phase every time.
[365:13.02]That's how it's programmed.
[365:14.70]So we kind of have to go through this.
[365:18.56]Let's see if I can show you the mid air shot or if I don't get a bad angle on him.
[365:26.69]Whoa!
[365:30.35]Wow!
[365:31.57]The swish sniper got it again.
[365:33.47]I have a little bit of skill.
[365:34.43]Two of them jumped up.
[365:35.31]Let me make sure of something here.
[365:36.45]Hold on.
[365:38.47]Okay, we didn't get the crash.
[365:39.33]Good.
[365:39.73]Two of them jumped at the same time, so I was a bit nervous.
[365:41.77]As long as the sound here plays, basically how the crash works is if there's too many sounds at the same time, the game cannot play this kind of boss beat music.
[365:50.83]And when you enter the portal at the end here, the game will not play that cutscene unless this song has played.
[365:58.01]It is going to make sure this song played, but because it got skipped because too many songs and sound effects played at the same time, you're kind of just stuck.
[366:08.53]in a forever white void out screen.
[366:11.77]Thankfully, though, that's the last dungeon.
[366:13.47]I only have two Super Swims left, and then we're going to be at the end of the game.
[366:20.37]So we are almost done with the run.
[366:26.14]So very good.
[366:26.68]Also, I picked up a heart here.
[366:27.84]It's a marathon run, so why not?
[366:33.76]What a run this has been, too.
[366:35.56]Yeah, what do you guys think, though, when you've seen most of it?
[366:38.50]I'm blown away.
[366:39.78]I'm blown away.
[366:40.56]It's unbelievable.
[366:43.26]It's unbelievable.
[366:44.90]Eyes have been glued on the screen the entire time.
[366:46.96]I've had to pee since 11 o'clock.
[366:50.63]I ain't getting up.
[366:53.95]Nice.
[366:57.75]Not too bad.
[367:02.67]I love the music on this game.
[367:04.60]Yeah, it's incredible.
[367:05.84]It's like the amount of skill, like practice and talent that you have to have to do something like this.
[367:11.70]And not only do it like just like on stream by yourself or anything, doing a marathon run in front of everybody else, thousands of people, it takes some real dedication right there.
[367:23.04]Truly.
[367:24.01]Yeah, in front of an audience is just... It's different.
[367:27.05]It's totally different.
[367:27.81]It's totally different.
[367:29.91]Yeah, it definitely adds a little bit of nerves.
[367:32.31]I've got to be honest.
[367:33.23]But it's gone pretty alright.
[367:36.78]I would say performance-wise, it's been... I'd give it a B. I'd give it an S. I'll be real with you, man.
[367:46.08]If it was up to us, we'd give you the S. That's perfect to me.
[367:50.20]The way I like to look at it is this.
[367:51.64]It's a better grade than I had in school.
[367:53.23]So, you know, I'll take it.
[367:54.37]I'll take it.
[367:58.00]But yeah, here is the cutscene after Wind Temple.
[368:01.16]Now, once I'm done with Wind Temple, technically I've beaten the dungeons.
[368:03.97]The definition of all dungeons is complete.
[368:06.45]It is just beat the game now.
[368:08.57]However, to beat the game, I need to get to Hyrule.
[368:11.33]And you remember that very long cutscene skip I did in Helm Rocks there earlier with the bird when I went out the door and everything?
[368:18.68]Yeah.
[368:19.34]So I...
[368:20.50]technically never beat, according to the game, Forsaken Fortress 2.
[368:25.28]So the portal, even though I unlocked it, is not spawned into the overworld, which is a big problem, because we need that portal, because it only spawns after you complete that.
[368:38.37]And the way that the game determines how the ocean is, is by something called states.
[368:44.04]Um, so I am going to do kind of a glitch I haven't done before here, where I'm going to manipulate states.
[368:49.46]So, anytime a special event is happening, for example, you remember Endless Night?
[368:53.88]That was a state that the game applied to the ocean, right?
[368:56.80]To kind of indicate, hey, the ghost ship should be spawned, it should be raining.
[369:00.66]There's also another state for, whoa, hello, I'm going to swim away from you a bit.
[369:04.18]There's other states too for small things like if it's day or night.
[369:08.17]A bunch of small things like that.
[369:10.61]And one of them also is, should Forsaken Fortress 1 be 2 or 3.
[369:16.85]So, thankfully, there are certain glitches that you can do in this game to manipulate the... Not the states, sorry, the layers.
[369:28.24]I don't want to make the tech-savvy people mad at me.
[369:30.38]Layers.
[369:30.84]It's called layers, not states.
[369:33.67]So, I'm going to abuse this minigame right here.
[369:37.72]So this minigame needs to apply certain special properties to the game.
[369:43.31]Um, cause you know, it's a minigame, it needs to keep track of minigame stuff.
[369:47.17]So, um...
[369:49.65]The really good thing is that it happens to be that the same layer that the game is temporarily put on while you're inside of this minigame is the same layer where Forsaken Fortress is the third one.
[370:02.90]It kind of overlaps.
[370:04.52]So I'm going to start this.
[370:05.32]You see it voids out, and this is when it reloads, by the way, to a different state.
[370:09.06]Now, if I ever land in the water here, I will void out and it will reset my state.
[370:13.32]But, with some very precise glitches, I can escape and maintain it.
[370:17.43]So, first, I need to go out of bounds, so I'm gonna... First, try and do a Bomb Boost to get on top of here.
[370:27.13]Then I'm going to go on top of this wall right here.
[370:30.41]And here is the worst storage spot in the game.
[370:33.55]I'm actually for once going to pause buffer it.
[370:35.36]It is so bad.
[370:36.66]And every time I fail, I'd have to do this bomb boost again.
[370:39.04]So hopefully we get a first try.
[370:44.52]Ah, frame early.
[370:46.62]That's fine.
[370:47.72]So yeah, if that happens... Bomb boost back up.
[370:54.17]Yeah!
[371:08.72]Also, I'm walking into the pole.
[371:10.60]The game doesn't want me to go inside of it, and it pushes me off.
[371:12.87]That's why I'm paused.
[371:14.67]Yes, okay, I got it.
[371:16.12]Nice!
[371:17.98]So that's what I'm doing.
[371:19.99]So now I have to make sure I don't touch the water.
[371:21.73]So I'm actually going to hookshot to get inside the boat.
[371:23.49]You might not even know you could do that.
[371:25.75]And now I have to sail out.
[371:28.39]What was that?
[371:30.53]That was radical.
[371:31.91]Now I have to sail outside of this coordinate.
[371:34.75]So you can hear this is the minigame music just started.
[371:36.92]It thinks I started this flying minigame.
[371:39.20]Now the property that if I touch the water, I will void out and I will reset the minigame.
[371:44.72]will unload once I leave this coordinate, because each coordinate is its own loaded portion of the ocean.
[371:50.59]So I'm going to sail off to the top of this part of the ocean, and now once I'm up here, I'm going to attempt to super swim across the entirety of the game.
[371:59.91]to Forsaken Fortress.
[372:00.87]If I drown, I have to redo everything I just did, and I just realized I never made a safety save, I don't think.
[372:06.29]We don't need those.
[372:07.99]Let's just not fail it.
[372:09.37]So I'm going to swim here.
[372:12.75]Then... I'm going to sail up here.
[372:20.03]This is very precise.
[372:21.89]Here, swim in place, start a Tingle Balloon.
[372:43.03]Okay, so that gave me an air refill, because otherwise I won't even be close to making it.
[372:48.78]Unfortunately, it looks like I lost a tiny bit of speed there, but that's fine, because I can just kind of try in here and hold on very precisely, go to this dock, and if I go through here, pause on this frame, bam, load up, I can get an air refill without... I lost the speed, that's fine.
[373:06.06]At least I can get an air refill here, and because I didn't void out, we still are on the correct layer, so that's good, that's all we care about.
[373:12.44]uh okay he wants to climb the dock honestly you know what I'm even I'm not even mad I'm more impressed that he was able to climb into that that's pretty good that's that's an accomplishment um mock one I repeat mock one yeah go fast lose lose track of link back here now we're gonna make it to the sacred fortress
[373:40.60]And once we get over here now, because it didn't drown, this game does not apply for Seiken Fortress 2, but it's the third one.
[373:48.58]You can see it's kind of burned down if you know the game well.
[373:50.76]So I'm going to dive underneath the map by just taking out my Wind Waker as I climb up off the ledge.
[373:57.58]Now, I have a problem.
[373:59.58]I don't have King of Red Lions.
[374:00.50]I can't enter the portal without it.
[374:01.69]Well, thankfully, I never watched the opening cutscene of Forsaken Fortress that you're supposed to hours ago.
[374:06.51]So by swimming here, this cutscene where you're supposed to come up with King of Red Lions in the castle.
[374:11.03]There's no way.
[374:11.85]There's no way.
[374:12.59]Oh, my God.
[374:13.07]Oh, my God.
[374:14.23]So we've seen this cutscene the whole game.
[374:17.11]Thank you.
[374:19.60]That's how you normally get introduced to Neil Gilmour the first time.
[374:22.44]Wow.
[374:23.08]That's awesome.
[374:24.04]And yeah, that is the last trick that could have gone wrong.
[374:28.97]Now we just have the two final bosses to beat.
[374:31.03]I am done with the terrible glitches, finally.
[374:33.23]Nice!
[374:34.09]That's it.
[374:35.03]That is all of them.
[374:37.17]We have a $100 donation from Matheson.
[374:41.09]Epic event, seeing some of my favorite runners and learning about some cool new ones.
[374:44.57]Keep up the awesome pace and let's put some money to some fantastic causes.
[374:49.83]Yeah!
[374:52.12]We have a $50 donation from LinkusFan.
[374:55.86]Nice.
[374:56.40]Nice.
[374:57.14]I have a feeling he might know me from before.
[375:01.82]LinkusFan?
[375:02.50]Yeah.
[375:03.04]Nice.
[375:03.60]Yeah.
[375:04.44]Maybe.
[375:06.10]I think the most, I don't know why, but on Twitch, there is a solid, I think, over a dozen separate accounts for Linkus7 to share.
[375:17.23]And the thing that is even better about it is the fact that people make fun of me because at home, I used to run to the bathroom every time I'm on cutscene.
[375:23.47]So people love spamming chairs.
[375:24.87]So there is an emote on Twitch, you might even have seen it, called Giga Chair.
[375:28.50]What you might not know is that is actually my chair.
[375:31.78]The even more funny thing, without calling any names, is that chair that is based upon was my old sponsor CLG that I was under.
[375:40.68]It's a CLG themed chair.
[375:43.08]And there are two separate esports orgs that on their channel have that enabled.
[375:48.41]And I don't think they realize that it's the CLG chair.
[375:52.52]So every time I'm in certain chats and I see they have the emote giga chair, I think it's so funny that they're just accidentally advertising CLG.
[376:01.56]The infiltration.
[376:02.26]They may know now.
[376:03.84]Yeah.
[376:04.72]Right, yeah.
[376:05.88]Check your emotes.
[376:06.36]They need to expose it in front of too many people, but yeah.
[376:09.86]A $25 donation from Mellow Mute.
[376:12.28]Pog.
[376:13.15]Nice.
[376:16.15]We can take a few more donations.
[376:18.03]We have some cutscenes here before we can fight Papa Cannon.
[376:22.45]We have a $14 donation from Stanz.
[376:28.41]For some reason, I don't think it's the real Stanz, saying, I can't stop using the company funds to buy Funko Pops.
[376:35.98]I haven't looked Ludwig in the eye in four months.
[376:38.30]That might be the real Stanz.
[376:39.74]Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[376:44.71]Thanks for all the donations, guys, today.
[376:47.03]There are so many of them.
[376:48.93]$125,000.
[376:49.57]Thank you, everybody, so much.
[376:53.90]Now, for these fights, I love that this is a thing in Zelda games.
[376:57.40]It's even in Breath of the Wild.
[376:58.94]Zelda games love to, for some reason, put the second last boss fight as the hardest one, and then they make the last one easy.
[377:05.18]In Breath of the Wild, you got Calamity Ganon, Omega Heart, and then you just get Dark Beast Ganon, Autoscroller, literally can't die.
[377:11.03]Stairs of the Kingdom, you get Omega Heart Army, followed up by the hardest Ganon that can parry you back to flying around on a dragon, Autoscroller.
[377:21.53]They just love to do that, and it's the same thing in this game.
[377:23.28]So, Puppet Cannon is a true enemy.
[377:25.06]But it's even harder in this run, because what a casual would do is they would take the Boomerang, cut down the courts that hold them up, and then you have an easy time to shoot the Pearl.
[377:34.75]I don't have the Boomerang, so that's where the meme Swedish Sniper comes from.
[377:38.19]Normally, I have pretty good aim here.
[377:40.35]Hopefully, I can still do it in a marathon run.
[377:42.40]We'll see.
[377:43.18]so I have to basically try and shoot the ball as he's moving around and it is very difficult because not only is it hard to aim on this uh version but also his movement is completely rng based so I have to kind of react to where he's moving and just hope I have good aim so let's see if we can do the first face hardest one missed the first insta shot that's fine one
[378:13.61]Slightly missed that.
[378:14.53]That's fine.
[378:15.23]Two.
[378:23.99]Ah, slightly missed it.
[378:27.23]And three.
[378:27.75]Oh, my God.
[378:28.84]These are marksmen.
[378:33.59]Second phase, he's gonna turn into a spider, come down.
[378:38.27]Now, I'm gonna try something, so there's something we do called a crip shot, where if you shoot, you can shoot, and then hold up left, and then shoot on a very specific frame, and you can actually double hit him as he's going upwards.
[378:52.34]I'll try it if I have the magic for it.
[378:54.76]I cannot promise I'm going to hit it, but that does save us all 15 seconds.
[378:58.55]It's important in the run when you do this.
[379:00.07]Let's see if we can get this.
[379:01.55]Let's see if we can get the double shot.
[379:07.38]Ah, frame early was fine.
[379:09.06]Hopefully here I get magic.
[379:10.18]Beautiful RNG pattern here, by the way.
[379:12.46]I have to rely on magic drops.
[379:13.80]Completely luck-based.
[379:14.56]I got two, though.
[379:15.18]That's perfect RNG.
[379:16.49]We'll take those.
[379:17.29]Oh, my God.
[379:18.25]Let's see if I can get the double shot here.
[379:23.75]Ah, so close.
[379:24.49]It's fine.
[379:25.57]Like I said, it's only a very little amount of time.
[379:28.65]And then...
[379:30.79]No magic on this one, though.
[379:31.99]That's fine, I guess.
[379:33.77]Let's just hope I have good aim on the third phase.
[379:36.38]So we're going to let him come down.
[379:38.16]We shoot the ball.
[379:39.16]And now for the third phase.
[379:40.14]The third phase is the snake phase.
[379:41.88]He's going to go around.
[379:43.70]Now, he gets more aggressive the further in you get, and then usually you can stun him by a bomb.
[379:50.39]But for the first part here, I kind of just have to...
[379:53.87]Kind of just have to react to how he moves.
[379:56.95]As you can see, he kind of likes to spin in circles.
[380:01.53]Ah, apparently missed.
[380:02.61]You can hit him there.
[380:03.60]Trying to get the midair is awesome.
[380:07.16]Yeah, normally I'd go for another one, but I don't have that much magic because I didn't get a drop, so we're going to take him down.
[380:12.84]I just hold a bomb, and basically he walks into me.
[380:17.19]and gets stunned for a few seconds, which gives him time to take him down.
[380:22.39]There he is, top of Ganon.
[380:24.21]Now we just have Ganondorf left.
[380:29.91]Now, for this room, it's a very tall room.
[380:32.02]Also, this is the room the RNG-based trick would be in, by the way.
[380:35.66]There are... I can show you when I get up there, but there's this tiny, spiky enemy that is at the very top, and you have kind of a shortcut warp.
[380:44.46]So how the trick works is you stand at the bottom, shoot the morph all the way up with a fire arrow, and then the little enemy will get lit on fire and get knocked back.
[380:56.37]The knockback is completely luck-based, and you need to get the furthest knockback animation it has, because if it does, it will get hit onto the pot lid of the pot and burn it since it is on fire.
[381:09.44]And that's how you can get up.
[381:18.29]Hey, he's making the same sound I am.
[381:23.70]Same.
[381:25.08]What are the odds, by the way, of the furthest knockback?
[381:29.28]Sorry?
[381:30.08]You were talking about the furthest knockback?
[381:33.08]Yeah.
[381:34.42]There are three morphs at the top.
[381:36.48]Two of them are close enough to where the furthest knockback can't hit it.
[381:40.32]And it's a one in three chance on two attempts.
[381:42.38]You have about a one in six on each individual morph.
[381:45.37]But since you can only do two and then you have to reload the room, that's why it's so RNG based.
[381:51.59]I'm going to do a little bit of a swag strut here, and it technically saves time if I don't get crushed.
[381:55.67]So instead of climbing here with a grappling hook, I'm going to jump slash, turn around, three perfect side hops, slash my sword, backflip through the ground.
[382:03.60]Save a little bit of time.
[382:07.30]And then here we're going to take a hookshot.
[382:13.79]And I will quickly show you, by the way, you can...
[382:18.86]Since it's only 10 seconds, I'll show you quickly here.
[382:23.30]These morphs right here, this is how the trick is.
[382:25.72]So basically, long story short, I'm all the underneath.
[382:28.44]I shoot this with a fire arrow.
[382:29.90]He has to get the furthest.
[382:31.40]Like that!
[382:31.98]Wow!
[382:32.66]If I went for it out of bounds, that wouldn't work.
[382:36.60]But just for demonstration, if I do the second one, you're going to see.
[382:40.88]Okay, Tudor, okay.
[382:42.10]It doesn't matter.
[382:43.22]Normally, it doesn't bounce far.
[382:44.86]I promise you it's a 1 in 6 chance.
[382:47.40]What is the chance of a 1 in 6 back-to-back?
[382:49.49]A 1 in 36?
[382:49.83]That is fine.
[382:52.15]I'm not upset.
[382:56.27]Anyways, that's how it works.
[382:58.10]Usually, they just die in place.
[383:00.62]But yeah, that's how the glitch would be performed if you were to go from up again and skip.
[383:05.88]And yeah, thank you, Nintendo, for making it so realistic that it's not angle that determines how far they bounce, but it's an RNG value.
[383:14.45]Now, do you guys remember how we had this beautiful singing earlier?
[383:19.38]Well, this is the ultimate one, and this goes back way past, like, my stream.
[383:23.83]Oh, my God, this one.
[383:25.49]This trend is from 2000, and I think 12.
[383:28.09]Every single event that this game has ever been performed at, this has been done.
[383:34.40]And we cannot stop that trend now.
[383:35.86]And it's not just my runs.
[383:37.00]Anyone has run this game.
[383:38.18]Oh, we're doing it.
[383:39.04]So this game has, let's say, not the best voice acting.
[383:44.65]So here there is basically two clips of voice acting.
[383:47.81]One is the king who's like, can you sit down?
[383:51.61]And then we will have Ganon.
[383:55.05]Ganon will get so mad that he doesn't get the Triforce that he's going to start laughing.
[383:58.99]And he's going to start laughing hysterically.
[384:01.45]He's going to go like, ah!
[384:03.90]in that tone.
[384:05.18]So once he starts, everyone at home, I want you to spam LOLW or KEKW, Link is here if you're a Link sub.
[384:12.19]Just spam laugh emotes and everyone in the room, I want you to...
[384:17.66]Throughout the whole thing, it's going to go for about 30 seconds.
[384:20.07]We can't break the tradition.
[384:23.59]It goes for a while.
[384:24.73]It goes for a while.
[384:25.99]I'm going to give everybody a countdown.
[384:27.33]It's going to happen in about one minute from now.
[384:29.43]We're going to go through the whole thing.
[384:30.98]It's going to be gorgeous.
[384:32.28]And let's keep this tradition alive.
[384:33.56]It's been alive for marathons, live now for 12 years, which is incredible.
[384:38.64]Wow.
[384:41.04]And I did not come up with this one.
[384:42.49]I would never have because...
[384:44.79]I don't really like to purposely.
[384:47.01]Okay, that's not true.
[384:47.61]I do like to make a fool of myself sometimes.
[384:49.31]But, like, not with laughing.
[384:55.00]That's one of my favorite parts whenever you do one of these runs.
[384:58.24]Just to look at your chat.
[384:59.92]When I'm making a fool of myself?
[385:01.52]No, the kek Ws, the LOL Ws.
[385:02.84]Okay, I was going to say.
[385:04.28]I love when you make a fool of yourself.
[385:05.52]When you make fun of yourself, yeah.
[385:10.39]Right.
[385:12.14]Here we go, Chad.
[385:12.86]Are you ready for this?
[385:13.78]It is going to happen in three, two... I did it in the beginning.
[385:21.32]Oops, wrong part.
[385:22.40]Sorry.
[385:23.04]I got ahead of myself.
[385:23.92]No, we're still waiting.
[385:24.94]It's after this one.
[385:25.68]Really long seconds.
[385:27.07]It's in three, two, one, and...
[385:32.65]Ah!
[385:33.05]Ah!
[385:33.39]Ah!
[385:33.78]Ah!
[385:47.32]He's still going.
[385:49.45]Beautiful job, everybody.
[385:52.61]Let's go.
[385:54.39]As a team, baby.
[386:08.60]Alright.
[386:09.78]Now, this fight should be pretty straightforward.
[386:13.44]Once this fight starts, if I do it well, I should finish this in 50 seconds.
[386:17.84]So time is coming up in about a minute from now.
[386:20.44]Like I said, it is, compared to the other one, when you know what you're doing, quite fast.
[386:25.88]He has three phases.
[386:26.94]However, you can activate them early by manually talking to Zelda when you know you've dealt enough damage.
[386:32.09]So that is what we're going to do.
[386:33.81]And it should go pretty smoothly.
[386:34.81]Where do you pull those from?
[386:39.18]You don't want to know.
[386:39.81]Yeah, we do not need to investigate the pouch back there.
[386:42.03]Alright.
[387:09.29]Okay, I did not mean to take three hits of damage there.
[387:11.79]Let me just not take any more damage, because I cannot take any more hits.
[387:16.40]I should have been paying more attention.
[387:17.52]Sorry, one second.
[387:34.25]Okay, time is coming up once my sword goes and makes a connection with his head.
[387:38.40]Don't take damage.
[387:43.18]Zelda, shoot, shoot.
[387:44.36]Thank you.
[387:44.82]Alright.
[387:47.72]And... time!
[387:49.76]Nice!
[387:52.69]Wow, what a run!
[387:54.01]Alright.
[387:57.71]Definitely had some mistakes along the way, but honestly,
[388:03.21]We showed it off.
[388:04.06]It's a hard category.
[388:04.96]I'm happy we were able to show it off.
[388:07.98]It's a very difficult run.
[388:09.32]Thank you, everybody, so much for watching.
[388:11.04]Thank you, everybody, for staying up for the runs.
[388:15.00]Appreciate you all so much.
[388:17.29]Thank you, all three of you, so much.
[388:18.77]Really appreciate it.

[388:49.36]What is the next one we have coming up?
[388:51.86]I believe we, I think we have a Muck Runner coming up.
[388:54.58]Nice, it's going to be an incredible run.
[388:56.14]It was part of Moist Esports previous, well, $10,000 speedrun competition.
[389:02.38]Yeah, he used the speedrun bounties all the time.
[389:04.22]It was the recent one.
[389:05.68]Exactly, yeah.
[389:06.52]Looking forward to that.
[389:07.52]We have the crab one going on right now that's going to be concluding tomorrow as well at the end of the event.
[389:11.58]So it's going to be incredible.
[389:13.32]So yeah, you will see me around the event.
[389:14.52]I'll be on the couch commentating every now and then.
[389:16.22]But that being said,
[389:17.62]I am going to sit down and just relax and watch this last run, and then I am heading so too bad.
[389:23.09]So thank you so much for watching.
[389:24.63]Let's give a round of applause for Lucas.
[389:26.03]Excellent, excellent, excellent.
[389:27.23]Amazing run, amazing run.
[389:29.65]Thank you so much.

[389:39.96]I'm going to watch the whole thing.
[389:42.16]I want to see the whole thing.
[389:42.94]As soon as I sat down for this, I knew I needed to watch every single second.
[389:45.88]I was wired in.
[389:46.26]I still have uneaten food here.
[389:47.47]I was locked in.

[392:09.88]He's supposed to do the weather.
[392:11.04]Yeah, if you have a weather, if you know how to do it, that'd be great.
[392:24.02]But Jerma's supposed to do it.
[392:24.84]I have the weather.
[392:26.06]Well, then go.
[392:27.18]I blow my wind of a thousand winds.
[392:30.62]I can make a cold glacier death spiral.
[392:33.90]I can do the weather.
[392:35.48]Could you do the weather, then?
[392:38.34]Is he going to fit in that?
[392:39.22]I can slip this on.
[392:42.55]It is kind of cozy.
[392:43.77]He left it warm for me.
[392:46.61]How you doing, Chad?
[392:49.52]We're almost at 200,000.
[392:50.82]If you guys haven't donated yet, now's the time.
[392:53.40]This shit's about to be over forever now.
[392:55.82]And if you don't donate, then you never will be able to have been a part of this Fast 50 event.
[393:00.56]And this will be the last one ever if we don't reach 200,000.
[393:03.07]That's not true, bud.
[393:06.33]No, I know it is.
[393:06.95]It is.
[393:07.17]Alright.
[393:10.51]And now for our weather program.
[393:11.75]What's up?
[393:13.70]Yeah, yeah.
[393:14.28]I have no idea.
[393:14.70]When Lovie gets back, he can figure out what he wants to do.
[393:18.46]Okay, anyways, I can do the weather.
[393:20.42]That's simple.
[393:22.02]Look at these donations that came in.
[393:23.70]Top five donators.
[393:25.20]Take a look.
[393:26.90]We've got Tiltify here at $5,678 total dollars.
[393:33.15]Can I get a scream?
[393:36.27]I don't think they can hear me over there.
[393:37.63]Adam Morgan, $5,000.
[393:37.99]That's a lot of money.
[393:47.18]Mika Mecha, $5,000.

[394:01.64]All for charity.
[394:05.90]I look like I'm a very wealthy man that's about to go to a nice steak dinner.
[394:12.69]Take a look at this, draped over the arm.
[394:14.97]Also, very important.
[394:17.72]The Bounty.

[394:32.53]We're going to see the world record holder very soon.
[394:37.93]Take a look at that.
[394:39.89]25 minutes and 55 seconds.
[394:42.33]Spicy.
[394:43.27]Your current leader.
[394:44.05]This is close.
[394:44.63]This is tight.
[394:46.05]No, it's not.
[394:47.57]I was blocking the other number.
[394:50.23]Anyways.
[394:52.25]Hey, did Jerma do this yet?
[394:55.01]Oh, I'm on a roller coaster.
[394:56.29]Look at how funny I am.
[394:58.89]Hey, how many times did Jerma do this?
[395:01.52]Oh, let me run.
[395:02.68]That guy sucks.
[395:06.54]Most unfunny fucking streamer I've ever seen.
[395:10.14]This shit's easy.
[395:10.82]I can stand around with a microphone to do this.
[395:14.07]Hey, back to you, couch.
[395:17.41]Thank you, Yeti.
[395:18.59]Thank you.
[395:19.45]And if you heard me talking during that segment, you didn't.
[395:21.39]What are you talking about?
[395:22.27]We're just watching some great content.
[395:24.13]We're watching the Yeti do the weather.
[395:25.92]Oh, and he's a good-looking Yeti.
[395:27.34]Yeah, he is.
[395:29.04]Yeah, the laughing track was from me, by the way, in case you heard anything.
[395:31.68]Oh, you were.
[395:32.28]I heard you laughing.
[395:32.90]It's just a funny segment.
[395:34.22]Hey, good content is good content either way.
[395:36.12]Kony, thank you for joining us.
[395:38.63]A good Super Mario?
[395:39.81]I am ready to watch some good Super Mario and some less good Super Mario.
[395:44.95]So there's been some talk.
[395:46.13]You guys are using N64 controller because you're just handing over the controller.
[395:48.87]Yeah, that's fine with me.
[395:50.15]That's fine with you.
[395:50.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[395:51.33]Dude, I was born in like the 1970s.
[395:53.35]Yeah, it's fine.
[395:54.49]I grew up with this.
[395:55.89]That's natural.
[395:56.81]We're in our last event and we have just crested $200,000.
[396:02.07]But I truly believe as a community that we can get close to $250,000.
[396:06.05]And that is my goal.
[396:08.91]Jerma walked by and gave me a very weird eye.
[396:11.48]And he's coming back.
[396:13.20]Whoa, Jerma, is there anything you want to say about this weekend?
[396:17.03]Uh... that yeti was talking shit.
[396:18.03]What happened?
[396:19.03]The yeti came out and said that Jerma guy sucks. He sucks so bad man. He's not funny.
[396:24.73]He did?
[396:25.03]He did, I don't know what beef you might have with him.
[396:27.03]I mean- I- he's in the hotel next to me.
[396:29.03]Oh, really? Yeah.
[396:30.03]Maybe you like uh- scraped his car in the parking lot or something?
[396:34.03]I mean I bumped into him in the hallway at the hotel but I didn't think anything of it. He kinda gave me like one of those.
[396:39.96]Yeah.
[396:40.48]It was kind of weird.
[396:41.20]He seemed a little grumpy.
[396:41.92]Maybe he woke up a little too early.
[396:43.08]Yeah.
[396:44.52]He did kind of have a weird kind of vibe to him.
[396:47.35]He gave me the weird look, and then he said he was going to fight me in the parking lot and stuff.
[396:54.38]Yeah I guess- he's- he's cool though.
[396:55.38]Yeah I saw him at the after party last night, he kinda came up to me and was like: Hey, my yeti girlfriend like your vibe.
[396:59.38]But I kinda just got out of there.
[397:00.38]Yeah?
[397:01.38]Yeah.
[397:01.38]This is just gonna make me feel weird, you know?
[397:05.38]He seems like a weird guy so-
[397:06.38]He does seem like a weird guy.
[397:07.00]How you feeling?
[397:08.00]I feel good.
[397:09.00]You had a good weekend?
[397:10.00]Yeah.
[397:10.70]This has been fun.
[397:11.00]The amount of runs that I- I just have never seen before. I said it last night- late last night. I was- I was up late.
[397:16.00]You were here the whole night, yeah.
[397:18.00]I just was enamored. The- the Spiro run and the Wind Waker run and the verything else before it too is just-
[397:24.21]I held my pee for about four and a half hours.
[397:27.21]That's insane.
[397:28.21]I was like I gotta get up and pee but no, no the runs are too good.
[397:31.09]You got because permanent damage to your kidneys.
[397:33.09]The damage that's been done to my internal organs.
[397:36.09]No, it's been great.
[397:37.09]Thank you for the fifty, anonymous for the fifty- sorry every time I look down there's just like hundreds and hundreds of dollars more donations.
[398:01.71]Beach balls, thank you for the five.
[398:03.79]Stan's his mom, thank you for the 10.
[398:05.81]I hope that's you.
[398:06.81]Love you.
[398:07.43]She did try and call me.
[398:08.53]It's my birthday, and I kind of don't know Walter.
[398:10.13]Hey, happy birthday.
[398:11.01]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[398:11.87]I wanted to catch you.
[398:13.03]Maybe I'll give her a call back on the couch, because it's not like Walter's going to be doing anything important here.
[398:18.99]So this is...
[398:22.08]This is the Mario... Is this the relay, right?
[398:25.50]This is the relay.
[398:26.20]So they've changed it up a little bit.
[398:28.10]The way it's going to work is there's two teams of three, and they must alternate.
[398:32.25]So are you trying to be sneaky, or are you your chicken?
[398:35.27]No, no, you're pecking the seed.
[398:36.69]Okay, he's actually living the bit.
[398:38.99]It's lore.
[398:39.75]It's actual method acting.
[398:41.64]Yes, yeah, yeah.
[398:43.24]That was beautiful.
[398:44.26]The entire run like that.
[398:45.76]Can you give us a...
[398:50.94]That's crazy, right?
[398:53.50]There's a chicken in the studio.
[398:56.12]There's two chickens in the studio.
[398:58.05]That was pretty good.
[398:59.33]Oh, yeah.
[398:59.73]It started strong, ended weak.
[399:02.38]We are getting looks from the runners.
[399:05.00]Hey, you're a cow.
[399:06.52]Oh, I am a cow.
[399:07.64]We got to hear the cow.
[399:10.80]Is that no?
[399:12.98]It's in here.
[399:14.24]Can you give us a demonstration?
[399:18.01]Way better.
[399:19.05]Yeah, give a demonstration.
[399:20.59]Nobody can look at me.
[399:21.25]Hey, everyone, close your eyes.
[399:23.97]And everybody watching at home, everybody close your eyes.
[399:26.03]Nobody can look when I do it because that's just part of our character.
[399:34.39]I don't think I can do it.
[399:35.00]I thought you were just going to burp.
[399:36.24]It kind of felt like I was going to burp.
[399:38.75]There was some indigestion.
[399:39.75]It was like, oops.
[399:42.90]Oh, this is great.
[399:44.52]No, this is great.
[399:45.18]This is going to be a phenomenal ending to the event.
[399:48.42]It's been a great event.
[399:49.38]$2,004.
[399:49.78]Oh, and we have someone who is donating as me as an imposter, because I promise you, you did not see me pick up my phone.

[400:40.11]They love you.
[400:40.75]I'm going to summarize all of them.
[400:41.85]They love you.
[400:44.87]What is your favorite run of the event?
[400:47.61]$25 from hashtag Team Ludwig.
[400:49.79]You guys got any favorites?
[400:51.78]I mean, honestly, they've all been amazing.
[400:55.48]But there's something about that Wind Waker run.
[400:57.96]Oh, he's pandering.
[401:00.14]No, the first, like, 30 minutes of that, it was just... I couldn't believe what I was even seeing.
[401:05.09]Thank you.
[401:05.85]You're like, oh, just hold on a second.
[401:06.99]You know, I've got to do this 200 times.
[401:08.35]Just like... I was just like... I had my mouth open the whole time.
[401:10.51]Everyone on the couch was just kind of like...
[401:16.90]Like, holy shit, this is unbelievable.
[401:20.22]What was your favorite run so far, Sans?
[401:22.40]Probably Hollow Knight.
[401:24.02]I think my two favorite games casually that were run here were Cuphead and Hollow Knight.
[401:29.10]And I think I hadn't watched as much Hollow Knight, so that was my favorite run for sure.
[401:33.02]I think my favorite run wasn't even technically really a run.
[401:35.86]It was actually the crowd control Minecraft.
[401:38.23]I don't know, I laughed so hard in my life during that race.
[401:41.91]It was incredible.
[401:43.73]But we've got so many more big donations.
[401:45.31]Thank you for the $50 game hopper.
[401:46.83]Love the Mario 64 speedrun community.
[401:48.25]And especially, simply, he got me into speedrunning in the first place.
[401:52.92]Thank you, thank you.
[401:53.61]Thank you, Alba, for the $10.
[401:54.71]Great event.

[402:06.22]Sorry, what do you want to say, Jeremy?
[402:08.96]I was going to say, everybody loves Stance.
[402:10.78]Yeah, everybody loves Stance.
[402:11.68]I was wasting my opportunity to say it.
[402:16.15]Hey, it's Red Bull.
[402:17.29]You know when I came in?
[402:18.53]You want a burger or chicken?
[402:20.21]Yeah.
[402:20.73]What are we getting for lunch?
[402:21.53]I walked by the couch.
[402:22.49]I actually thought you were in a tuxedo.
[402:25.18]I thought you were in a tuxedo.
[402:25.86]I'm looking good for the final day.
[402:28.84]Are you guys going to be mic'd up?
[402:30.12]What's your deal here?
[402:30.70]I think we're trying to set that up now.
[402:33.74]Okay.
[402:33.86]Nice.
[402:33.98]Okay.
[402:37.49]Yeah, no worries.
[402:38.69]Sounds good.
[402:39.66]Just passing it between.
[402:40.50]You pass the controller and the stick.
[402:42.08]Yeah.
[402:42.54]They do it like this.
[402:44.96]They get 2D.
[402:46.66]Oh, we had 205K, and we have a big match coming through from PB Jones.
[402:50.24]Big match.
[402:50.88]Big match.
[402:51.96]They're doing tech support, so they didn't know.
[402:53.92]No, we're raising money hand over fist.

[403:26.71]We got an anonymous $100 saying, for Jerma.
[403:31.43]We got another hundo that scrolled out of my chat.

[403:36.58]Thank you, Flake, for the $100.
[403:38.32]Unbelievable talent in the stream.
[403:39.60]Great job, everybody.
[403:41.58]Shoutouts to the rats.
[403:43.00]I feel like that one is...
[403:44.69]Rats.
[403:45.31]Rats.
[403:45.87]It's you.
[403:46.76]Yeah, that's the Jerma.
[403:49.20]Thank you, Loganford100.
[403:50.58]Such a great community.
[403:51.46]Time to lock in 250k.
[403:52.58]I think we might be able to do it.
[403:55.08]We can do it.
[403:55.52]Honestly, yes.
[403:56.04]We've got some big matchers.
[403:57.19]For my birthday, I want a $5 train.
[403:59.49]If you've got it, if you don't like the stream, tell the people on Twitch to come to YouTube and like the stream.
[404:04.81]We joked about bots, but at this point, I'm willing to go anywhere for $250 for this event.
[404:08.84]Yeah.
[404:10.50]It's going to be incredible.
[404:12.46]Paint with a hundo.
[404:13.54]Time to make it for 250.
[404:14.97]So many huge donations rolling in.
[404:16.85]Thank you guys so much.
[404:17.91]We all appreciate it so much.
[404:19.85]Thank you, everybody.
[404:20.71]I'm excited for this.
[404:21.93]I'm very curious how this is going to work.
[404:23.92]Yeah.
[404:24.58]Yeah, I think my...
[404:26.30]This was a different event at one point, and at one point I was going to be forced to be the 16-star closer for one of the teams against Ludwig.
[404:33.74]You see in the beginning of Space Jam where they chain up Michael Jordan so they can beat him?
[404:36.90]Ludwig wanted to do that to me, right?
[404:38.83]But the problem is, and I've only embarrassed myself with my gaming stories, I actually play on an emulator with an Xbox One controller.
[404:46.43]Really?
[404:47.11]My time is pretty good.
[404:47.89]It's like around 21 minutes.
[404:49.05]It's not like anything to write home about, but I would not be able to do this on an N64 controller.
[404:53.42]I think it would be easier, though, because you have notches.
[404:56.16]Sure.
[404:56.32]Unlike yours, you cannot get good angles.
[405:00.14]That's okay, but I think the muscle memory is just completely gone.
[405:02.60]Well, also, maybe I'm just old here, okay?
[405:04.28]On the couch.
[405:04.82]I don't think it's you, though.
[405:05.74]But I remember growing up in the generation where we had PC games with a big, you know, old flight stick.
[405:11.12]Oh, the HOTAS, yeah.
[405:11.72]And it would be exactly the exact same thing on this, because the Z button is just in the back.
[405:15.74]Yeah.
[405:15.86]It's like a flight stick.
[405:16.58]You're like a fighter pilot.
[405:17.56]Yeah, exactly.
[405:19.66]Also, thank you, Tyler, for the $200 donation and three calories for the $500.
[405:23.46]That was a 208.
[405:26.80]So many.
[405:27.51]It was 205 five seconds ago.
[405:28.95]Tyler with a 200 saying, thanks a lot for the event and Simple Flips for being a beacon in people's lots of people's darkness.
[405:35.61]I think there was a typo there, but thank you so much.
[405:37.37]Thank you, three calories for the $500.
[405:39.25]The stream was a blast.
[405:40.07]Thank you everybody so much for helping out and for everybody who ran the event.
[405:42.45]Thank you so much.
[406:25.05]Jerma fan club thing for the one dollar. Jerma you look so pretty today.
[406:59.16]A hundred dollars from StemHeads.
[407:00.86]StemHeads rise.
[407:02.06]Shout out to the patch.
[407:03.39]I don't know what I'm saying.
[407:04.23]Hopefully not something weird or bad.

[407:59.77]We- we had a seven dollar train going last night.

[413:22.53]985 is Jerma.
[413:24.19]Oh my God, I'm a fucking idiot.
[413:26.23]We work together every day.
[413:27.31]I feel like you should know this one.
[413:29.15]To me, he's Jeremy.
[413:31.35]We don't address each other.
[413:32.39]It's like, oh, hey, Jerma985.
[413:33.55]Hey, Jerma985.
[413:33.91]Let me ask you something about this meeting.
[413:36.23]I was just trying to figure it out.
[413:37.99]When are you playing Elden Ring DLC?
[413:39.69]I'm going to be playing the Elden Ring DLC at launch.
[413:42.79]At launch, June 21st or something.
[413:44.93]I believe that because every time I asked about a video game and I was like, have you played these?
[413:48.90]He's like, no, but I played Elden Ring.
[413:50.88]You continue to bring it up.
[413:52.24]So he loves this game.
[413:53.26]Shout out to the bingo streamers.
[413:56.16]Some of them back here, I think.
[413:57.48]That opened my eyes.
[413:58.90]Oh, the Elden Ring bingo?
[413:59.72]It was so cool.
[414:00.20]It was awesome.
[414:00.98]I just love the idea that you can do kind of anything.
[414:03.52]You can do kind of anything.
[414:04.36]You could have like, oh, go talk to this NPC.
[414:06.86]Oh, go kill this boss.
[414:08.60]I look like bosses with God in their name.
[414:10.62]And so then you're just like, okay, which one's got this?
[414:12.10]Okay, where can I do it?
[414:12.90]How can I route this?
[414:13.76]So much fun stuff.
[414:14.83]It gives such an awesome dynamic to kind of run, especially the competition.
[414:19.39]Sniping a spot from somebody, like if you're both going to the same thing at the same time, you don't even realize it.
[414:24.17]I loved it.
[414:24.91]It was awesome.
[414:25.35]And the exciting thing, too, is if we do Fast 50 next year, we'll have plenty of time for the DLC to be out, so we can have a speedrun of the DLC.
[414:32.13]Speedrun of the DLC, or bingo with the DLC included.
[414:35.01]You guys are good to go?
[414:37.25]If broadcast is good, we're good.
[414:38.13]Broadcast, let me know in my ear if we are good.
[414:40.11]Are we going to be able to hear the runners communicating?
[414:41.95]How are we going to do this?
[414:46.52]Okay, production, they are going to be using the stick mic.
[414:49.97]Okay.
[414:50.45]Alright.
[414:50.85]Do you want to test it?
[414:52.05]Oh, my God.
[414:52.81]Scoot to the middle.
[414:54.03]Give me some of that.
[414:54.71]Yeah.
[414:55.01]Give me some of that.
[414:56.07]Oh, 14?
[414:57.14]I got up to put a costume on, and it went up by $5,000.
[414:59.38]It went up $4,000.
[415:00.46]Yes, it went up big, and that's thanks to people like Stankpuss with the $50.
[415:03.34]They gave $50, dude.
[415:09.56]Barf Drinker, thank you for the 25.
[415:11.12]Barf Drinker.
[415:12.12]I have to poop.
[415:13.20]Thank you for the 10.
[415:14.50]Barf Drinker?
[415:15.91]That's like one of my favorite people.
[415:17.41]Yeah.
[415:18.49]Oh, sorry.
[415:18.97]Barfy?
[415:19.51]I call him Barfy.
[415:20.78]I'm not even kidding, by the way.
[415:22.52]Hello.
[415:23.04]Hello.
[415:23.58]I can hear you guys on the stick, Mike.
[415:25.14]Yeah, we can hear you all.
[415:26.20]Yeah, you sound great.
[415:29.85]To Piggy, they give a $50.
[415:31.35]Ask Simple Flips about Jay-Z.
[415:34.15]I don't know if he can hear me.
[415:35.65]He's locked.
[415:36.09]They're locked in.
[415:36.97]Here's the thing, Chad.
[415:38.17]They want to win badly.
[415:39.59]This is a competition amongst their peers.
[415:41.17]This is going to be crazy.
[415:42.11]They're taking marking so seriously.
[415:43.33]They haven't played it enough.
[415:44.45]The minute they sat down, Davey's been practicing stars.
[415:47.31]Yes, they have.
[415:47.95]We've seen a lot of stars out of the corner.
[415:49.65]We're getting like a little pre-show.
[415:52.19]Fangaron, thank you for the $100.
[415:54.94]Much appreciated.
[415:55.76]Micor, thank you for the $25.
[415:57.58]Colin, thank you for the $10.
[416:00.62]We are good to start.
[416:02.26]Runners, can you hear me in your ear?
[416:05.81]Whoa.
[416:06.37]Can you hear me in your ear or just out loud?
[416:09.23]No.
[416:09.41]He cannot hear you.
[416:10.13]No, we're going to hear you guys with a stick.
[416:12.39]Do you hear me now?
[416:13.13]Yes, I do.
[416:14.81]But can you guys hear me in your ear?
[416:16.25]Okay, perfect.
[416:17.61]We are ready to start when you guys are ready to start.
[416:19.81]Yeah, I can hear you.
[416:22.15]This is your stream.
[416:23.21]I'm really nervous all of a sudden.
[416:26.50]I know.
[416:28.42]You're starting off, right?
[416:30.88]Yeah, I'm scared.
[416:32.02]Are you scared?
[416:32.84]Be honest.
[416:33.98]So I've never played on the controller I'm playing on.
[416:37.18]Yeah.
[416:37.82]I'm playing on a Hori pad.
[416:39.22]Yeah.
[416:39.88]I play on GameCube.
[416:41.17]That's incredible.
[416:42.01]That's similar.
[416:42.71]Isn't that better than N64?
[416:43.43]That's better than 64.
[416:44.05]That's way better than 64.
[416:45.05]I think it's better than both, to be honest, but it's not a GameCube controller.
[416:48.95]Sure.
[416:49.27]Okay, but Simply Stick is steel.
[416:51.27]He is a steel stick.
[416:52.25]Hold it up higher.
[416:53.09]I held Liam's stick, and then I went to do spins, and he said, don't do that.
[416:58.70]You said, hey, buddy.
[416:59.72]I made a phone call.
[417:00.84]There's only so many spins you get out of this.
[417:02.66]Alright.
[417:03.18]Are you both starting with Lakitu?
[417:04.44]Is this Kony versus Ludwig?
[417:05.56]We won't kick us off.
[417:06.50]We're doing star one.
[417:07.70]Our order, just so you guys know, it's me, then Liam, then Cheese.
[417:11.46]What's your order?
[417:12.22]Wait, you're going... Oh, we didn't think about that.
[417:14.37]We're going clockwise.
[417:15.39]Oh, that is clockwise.
[417:16.45]Okay, great.
[417:16.73]You're right.
[417:17.03]You, Liam, Cheese?
[417:17.99]Yes.
[417:18.73]Would you rather do second or third?
[417:19.99]I'll go second.
[417:20.73]Okay, great.
[417:21.11]You guys are in the same order.
[417:22.35]Okay, perfect.
[417:23.37]So you will know exact only because you can split off in stars.
[417:26.03]We go to left.
[417:26.35]Alright.
[417:28.65]Let's get it.
[417:29.77]Thank you, Liam's sister, for the $50.
[417:31.01]We are ready when you guys are ready.
[417:32.85]Count us down and we can get rolling.
[417:35.19]Let's do it.
[417:37.74]Alright.
[417:40.52]Or I can count you guys down if you don't want to hold the mic or whatever.
[417:42.82]Give us a countdown.
[417:44.12]Alright, I'm going to give you a countdown.
[417:45.64]Our final run of the event.
[417:47.22]Get your donations in because we are starting in five, four, three, two, one.
[417:51.24]Go!
[417:58.34]What's it mean?
[417:59.46]I want to see one of them beans picking the save file.
[418:01.60]Like, they're so nervous.
[418:02.53]You know what I mean?
[418:03.23]There it was.
[418:06.97]You messed up the file.
[418:08.07]They're behind.
[418:08.65]They're behind a couple frames.
[418:10.00]You called it.
[418:11.66]Ludwig actually is quitting the run.
[418:13.18]Yeah, he already gave up.
[418:15.19]That file select was too much to come back from.
[418:16.85]He's just gone.
[418:17.41]That's what I'm saying.
[418:18.65]That shit kind of boring.
[418:19.79]Don't be nervous.
[418:20.43]Don't be nervous.
[418:21.05]You look good.
[418:21.43]Don't say thank you.
[418:22.31]You look good.
[418:23.01]Do you want to swap?
[418:24.03]You want to swap?
[418:24.73]I'll go over there.
[418:27.18]Okay.
[418:27.54]Let's go.
[418:27.90]Let's go.
[418:31.53]Linkus, what is your familiarity with Super Mario 64?
[418:33.91]You've already said it's the game you would most like to be a god at.
[418:36.97]Yeah, I have about a two-hour time in 120 star.
[418:39.67]I've got 53, I think, 54 in 70 star.
[418:43.39]And a good time in 16 star.
[418:45.47]I can't remember the time.
[418:46.35]But you've done all the runs.
[418:47.49]Yes, yeah.
[418:48.85]So if there's any special strats going on, I can cover it.
[418:51.95]But that being said, I don't know how much... This is our first test.
[418:55.35]Can they hit Lakitu Skip on controllers they're unfamiliar with?
[418:57.87]Oh!
[418:58.03]Oh!
[419:01.86]That's what I'm talking about.
[419:04.68]Oh, it's all good.
[419:05.76]This is big.
[419:06.86]It's his first time on this controller.
[419:08.20]Oh, that was incredible.
[419:12.23]That was big.
[419:13.77]That's big.
[419:14.21]That's going to be a six-second lead getting into the first stage.
[419:17.63]And we're starting with bomb clip, I'm assuming here.
[419:20.61]Looks like we're not doing the LBLJ round.
[419:22.45]I promise you, Ludwig's sweating bomb clip right now.
[419:24.19]He missed his bomb.
[419:24.57]He missed his bomb.
[419:24.99]Let's see if anyone will do it.
[419:25.79]What they will try and do is jump and throw the bomb at the same time and then pick it up as it is starting to explode.
[419:31.09]If you do it at the right time, it will push you backwards.
[419:33.38]He's got it?
[419:33.64]He got a small one, but I think it might work.
[419:34.96]Yeah, he got it.
[419:35.46]He got it.
[419:35.92]He got it.
[419:36.14]Nice.
[419:36.24]Okay, he gets the clip.
[419:36.84]Okay, he's nasty.
[419:37.54]Wait, do they both have it?
[419:38.54]He's got it.
[419:39.46]No!
[419:39.52]No!
[419:44.70]We saved him, we saved him.
[419:48.56]He's good, he's good.
[419:50.34]This is a match between me and you right now.
[419:53.74]Can I finish my star?
[419:54.70]Can I finish my star?
[419:55.97]Please do, we've been waiting.
[419:57.43]Yeah!
[419:58.97]Okay, start it up.
[420:01.57]I just like to free the chomp, you know what I mean?
[420:04.07]He's good.
[420:04.33]You can tell me your strategy.
[420:08.31]I'll do 100.
[420:10.29]In our opinion, they're kind of like the 2016 Warriors.
[420:14.30]This is a gaming event, to be clear.
[420:17.06]Right?
[420:17.46]They have too many superstars.
[420:18.84]I'm kind of like the LeBron James on the Cavs.
[420:21.98]And who's the LeBron James here?
[420:23.50]He's doing good.
[420:25.14]Oh, no.
[420:25.50]Oh, hell yeah.
[420:27.05]Please.
[420:28.89]Dude, there's a delay, I swear.
[420:32.35]This is where we come back.
[420:35.01]This is where we come back.
[420:35.89]He doesn't mess it up twice, right?
[420:37.43]No way he'll mess it up twice.
[420:39.27]I can't see.
[420:40.43]Surely he doesn't mess it up two times.
[420:42.67]Nice.
[420:43.07]Got it.
[420:44.99]I love that one.
[420:45.77]Very clean strat.
[420:47.09]Pick up the star through the wall through a precise setup.
[420:49.47]Are you doing 100?
[420:51.11]Yeah, the other team is doing 100 coins plus reds right now.
[420:55.30]And he accidentally picks up a star.
[420:58.47]Oh, that's a big mistake.
[420:59.45]They use so much time getting coins.
[421:00.75]That is a big mistake.
[421:01.72]Alright, go, go, go.
[421:04.49]Alright.
[421:05.19]He's going for 100 plus res, too.
[421:06.81]He only needs 60 more.
[421:07.65]That's also such an easy Kony start.
[421:10.59]I feel like you leave that one for your third stringer.
[421:14.38]Wait, you're right.
[421:17.44]They're going for the easy ones for Kony.
[421:19.00]I'm going to take the big ones.
[421:20.06]Oh, sorry.
[421:20.84]Like what?
[421:21.28]I'm going for Owlus right now.
[421:22.82]If you hit Owlus.
[421:24.76]That's bold.
[421:26.19]That's real bold.
[421:27.05]Chat, will you put money in the pot if Ludwig gets Owlus right now?
[421:30.70]Look, how about this?
[421:31.98]For every time I fail Owl-less, I'll donate $100.
[421:33.43]I'm not going to do it.
[421:34.65]You're going to do it on a little scale.
[421:36.04]Okay.
[421:38.08]I've seen this one.
[421:39.66]I've been around the block.
[421:40.72]No, you're good.
[421:42.14]Are you getting Wild Blue?
[421:43.74]I got to figure something else out.
[421:46.36]Thank you.
[421:46.80]Bless up.
[421:47.29]Yeah, you got camels.
[421:48.61]Yeah.
[421:49.33]Yeah, I think as a 16-star runner exclusively, I know what I would want to get were I in Kony or Ludwig's shoes.
[421:55.51]Okay.
[421:55.71]And it's like, I'm killing the Womp.
[421:57.27]I'm climbing the tower.
[421:58.39]Exactly.
[421:58.87]I'm stance flying up there holding the owl.
[422:00.95]Flying with the owl.
[422:01.57]Of course I'm flying.
[422:03.45]I'm going for flying with the owl.
[422:04.85]You know what I mean?
[422:05.57]You do not want me to get red coins.
[422:06.83]You don't want me to get any of these other ones.
[422:07.91]Those are the ones I would feel comfortable with.
[422:09.21]One explainer worth mentioning.
[422:10.67]Yes, sir.
[422:11.11]100 coin, you can get both stars.
[422:12.93]Because in 100, technically, you get the star.
[422:15.66]You get the red and you get that.
[422:16.80]Yeah.
[422:17.02]Okay.
[422:17.34]Okay.
[422:17.82]Okay.
[422:18.00]Fair enough.
[422:18.92]Did both teams hear that?
[422:19.82]Are you guys good?
[422:21.20]That if you get 100 coins, you can get the red coin star?
[422:22.96]Okay.
[422:23.12]Yeah.
[422:23.26]Yeah.
[422:23.42]Just making sure.
[422:24.79]I thought that was going to be a great exploit throughout this.
[422:26.71]Me too, that you could just hand the controller off.
[422:28.69]And they could just go get the star.
[422:30.75]Not the singular Coney here, but it sounds like he's struggling.
[422:33.79]We call that the Linkus scam.
[422:37.49]Thank you to Aviator Adam, PokeDude, Asian Drag, Sorrel, Penguin, Fallen Heist.
[422:42.13]I think we're having Ludwig trying Owlus right now.
[422:44.96]Let's see.
[422:45.42]Come on, Gwen.
[422:46.10]Come on.
[422:46.58]On a controller he's never used?
[422:48.14]Come on.
[422:48.42]First try.
[422:48.92]First try.
[422:50.12]No, not close enough.
[422:52.50]Didn't get the right line up with the camera.
[422:55.86]Okay, that's $100 he said he would give.
[422:58.89]To be fair, I can see with a trick like this where cameras are more precise, it's harder for him, because he has a C-stick normally to have to do.
[423:03.83]Here he has to deal with buttons.
[423:05.11]Let's see.
[423:05.91]A third frame wall kick did not make it up.
[423:11.02]That's two attempts, though.
[423:12.02]Keep count, Jack.
[423:12.84]Yeah, that's $200, Shep.
[423:13.36]Yeah.
[423:18.14]Keep going, Ludwig, you got it!
[423:24.66]Rock in!
[423:25.38]Oh, no!
[423:29.43]Hey, there's an owl in the tree that takes you up there.
[423:32.21]It's actually way faster.
[423:34.05]There's a secret owl in that tree down there.
[423:36.25]He's very nice.
[423:38.13]Hold on, here we go.
[423:39.21]Chill, chill, chill.
[423:40.98]I'm getting nervous.
[423:41.84]He's actually getting nervous.
[423:47.33]He's got it.
[423:47.63]Oh, that's good.
[423:48.11]That's good.
[423:50.31]That's good.
[423:51.23]I really don't know.
[423:51.75]I can't tell you why.
[423:54.86]Those are looking good to me, but I'm also terrible.
[424:00.20]I'm wondering if he's forgetting to stop using up the analog stick during a triple jump.
[424:05.00]That gives him an additional frame.
[424:07.50]Hey, if you want to see how it was done, we just saw it on the right.
[424:09.82]Yeah, exactly.
[424:10.54]Is it me?
[424:10.90]That's it.
[424:11.24]That's it.
[424:12.12]Oh, okay.
[424:13.42]First try.
[424:14.18]That is $700 for charity if I did not miscount.
[424:17.17]That is $700 for charity.
[424:18.23]Clean.
[424:18.47]The Cheese Man, thank you for the $150.
[424:21.79]VIP Daniel, thank you for the $100.
[424:27.98]Squeaks' version, in parentheses.
[424:34.79]Are they ahead right now?
[424:36.33]Yes, they are ahead one star.
[424:37.97]But I don't remember what they've gotten.
[424:40.72]Okay.
[424:41.44]Looks like Liam is going for the easy star, too.
[424:44.50]Yeah.
[424:44.96]Hey, it's just a friendly competition, man.
[424:46.20]You don't have to get so mad.
[424:48.12]I do think so much of this is just going to be trying to set up your third stringer, making sure that they are getting the fastest stars.
[424:54.63]Absolutely.
[424:55.19]Especially when we get to the swimming stages or anything where slight unoptimization will lose you minutes.
[425:00.89]Yeah.
[425:01.43]What are you going for here?
[425:04.77]Oh, they're talking about it.
[425:08.23]Wait, Candleless.
[425:09.17]Have we done it?
[425:09.99]Yeah.
[425:12.57]Wait, we have to do Candleless.
[425:13.59]I did.
[425:14.98]Ooh, the team play on Team Ludwig.
[425:18.49]Not looking good.
[425:21.88]And it looks like Team Kony.
[425:23.58]Is it fine to call them Team Kony, do you think?
[425:25.97]We got it.
[425:26.61]Sure, I mean, if they didn't give us a team name, we'll call them Team Kony.
[425:29.03]Yeah, they just finished the entire thing.
[425:31.39]Our team name is Team Liam.
[425:32.69]Team Liam?
[425:33.39]Please do not misname us, Team Liam.
[425:34.85]Okay.
[425:35.27]Alright, we're going to Jolly Roger Bay.
[425:37.94]Sort of like a draft pick.
[425:39.08]I'll be taking my towels to Jolly Roger Bay.
[425:41.58]We'll go to J.R.B.
[425:42.26]We'll go to J.R.B.
[425:43.60]real quick.
[425:44.46]J.R.B.'
[425:44.52]'s going to be in here.
[425:45.74]I don't know.
[425:46.56]It's so funny.
[425:47.56]This shit is scary, man.
[425:48.76]I bet.
[425:49.27]I can't imagine it.
[425:50.05]I have to remember all the stars in the game and what the easy ones are.
[425:53.19]Yeah.
[425:53.87]Well, they should be able to help you.
[425:55.33]Yeah.
[425:56.19]I don't know anything about this.
[425:57.57]They were like, go to the eel.
[425:58.63]I don't... What?
[426:00.45]Where does he live?
[426:01.89]Okay, now the question is, will any of them go for a frame walk or anything really precise here in these Jolly Roger Bay stage?
[426:12.78]Nice.
[426:14.94]Is it me?
[426:15.92]Okay.
[426:17.16]We're taking our talents to Rainbow Ride.
[426:20.99]We're going directly there.
[426:22.23]Like if it's my turn.
[426:24.17]Oh, no.
[426:26.53]Maybe try it once.
[426:28.97]Swimming into the ship.
[426:30.81]That window's not open.
[426:32.89]Going for the reattempt.
[426:34.07]Dequit?
[426:34.95]It's very precise to clip through.
[426:36.49]You try and swim into it.
[426:37.39]It'll push you through.
[426:38.15]And then you have to hit the loading zone behind you.
[426:39.93]But he gets hit.
[426:40.87]He's going to drown, I think.
[426:44.02]Oh no, he's gonna drown!
[426:45.52]Wait, no, wait!
[426:46.74]Oh!
[426:46.92]He dies while picking up the coin!
[426:51.44]Oh my god!
[426:52.53]I heard the sound, I heard the sound!
[426:55.23]That's the scary thing about a golden clip like this, in a marathon.
[426:57.79]If you don't get that first try, if you get hit by that eel, you're screwed.
[427:02.05]I don't think we should give him a hard time, Cody just learned this game.
[427:04.34]So if we lose, we gotta remember that, right?
[427:07.58]Let's all lock that in.
[427:09.12]Yeah.
[427:12.39]I just saw a man die in Jolly Roger Bay today.
[427:20.20]That's crazy.
[427:23.02]God, at a certain point, if they handed me the controller outside of the Jolly Roger Bay painting, I'm leaving.
[427:27.81]I'm going somewhere else.
[427:28.85]You know what I mean?
[427:29.95]Do that one.
[427:30.83]It would be even smarter to split up Wom's Fortress for Konyon, because that's seven stars.
[427:36.35]All of these are in the lobby.
[427:37.51]It's not that long of a run.
[427:38.70]To run back and forth between them.
[427:39.66]Exactly.
[427:39.98]I think the time to run back might not lose more time than messing up the swimming stage.
[427:43.68]That is so smart.
[427:44.56]Yeah.
[427:44.90]Yeah.
[427:46.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[427:46.74]Okay.
[427:47.50]It would also work on the basement, especially on Lethal Lava Land and Shifting Sand Land.
[427:51.66]I think that would be a huge meta.
[427:54.06]Oh, they're going for the Frame Walk.
[427:56.00]Is he going to... Oh, barely gets to height.
[427:59.49]That was sick.
[428:00.23]That was incredible.
[428:01.23]If you don't know how to hold, that is very difficult.
[428:02.87]You're not supposed to be able to walk up a slope like that.
[428:05.21]So you have to, like, go up there, and it lets you compress it every other frame, basically.
[428:09.31]And if you don't, it will slip down, but you can just barely make it up to that box.
[428:12.39]Okay, you're going to do chest.
[428:13.79]I don't know where that is.
[428:14.63]So...
[428:15.47]See that hole down there to the left?
[428:17.95]You just go to the left, and then you go to the back of the cave.
[428:19.91]So they are using this run to tell Coney where he's going to go on the next start.
[428:25.50]They're like, hey, we're going down here.
[428:26.86]When you get down here, go left.
[428:28.62]I found out where the treasure chests are.
[428:30.24]The treasure chests, the big claw if you don't want legs.
[428:33.16]OK, let's get it.
[428:35.32]I want to see if it does the order correctly for the chests.
[428:39.04]Beautiful technique.
[428:39.99]If there is an order, you do have to follow.
[428:42.15]And this is where being a great teammate can help your team.
[428:45.85]Absolutely.
[428:46.49]Can you claw and hold?
[428:48.31]I can also tell here that they are emulator runners because in these stages, yeah, he just told them to hold left.
[428:53.09]Yeah.
[428:53.42]You will lose, not underestimation, like 5, 10, 20 seconds on these stages.
[428:57.66]And it feels so bad.
[428:58.82]It is so incredibly slow.
[429:01.22]Left, left, left.
[429:03.56]One set right, one set left.
[429:04.96]Which is insane.
[429:06.55]This is the way.
[429:07.37]Help!
[429:08.15]Help!
[429:08.75]You don't want to look at the jet stream.
[429:10.35]It's laggy.
[429:10.73]That's crazy.
[429:12.07]They were scamming.
[429:14.11]Go left, back of the cave.
[429:16.00]Back of the cave?
[429:16.82]Oh, it's because I was watching this team.
[429:19.38]That's so funny.
[429:20.56]I'm getting distracted.
[429:22.12]Oh, my goodness.
[429:24.79]Cody might die from the pillars.
[429:27.33]Oh my goodness!
[429:30.23]Puzzle solved!
[429:31.01]Incredible.
[429:47.68]That was like three dudes trying to figure out what to text back a girl.
[429:49.82]Yeah.
[429:50.79]No, no, no.
[429:51.23]Say this.
[429:51.51]She's going to love it.
[429:51.97]She's going to love it.
[429:53.25]And then the text says, you up?
[429:54.87]Oh, my God.
[429:56.39]It's just hype.
[429:57.99]So here's the question.
[429:59.43]Are they going to try and guide Ludwig and Kony through their last star here in Jolly Roger Bay, or are they just going to tell them to leave and go to another one?
[430:05.61]No, no, no.
[430:06.26]The last star is easy.
[430:07.18]Is it?
[430:07.36]What is the last star?
[430:08.24]Probably because, well, it's 100, and then it's –
[430:12.18]Oh, yeah, but Kony's team did leave, though, the Aquarium one, which is one of the easiest starts in the game, and it's right next to the Loading Zone in Jollyroader Bay, so they can actually hop in there and not have to lose any time in the Overworld.
[430:23.13]Oh, and you get coins and red coins in the same one, so that's two, so there will be one left.
[430:26.30]Oh, so you and Kony will not have to run else than that.
[430:28.42]I have to do Eel.
[430:29.44]Okay.
[430:29.54]You're going to do Eel, okay.
[430:30.76]Yeah.
[430:31.94]which is not too bad I mean sometimes it's tough for him to get out but you just sit right above him yeah I can do that yeah as long as you're kind of swimming down it's a pretty straightforward start it can be difficult if you miss the timing because when you get to the casual shred it's actually a difficult start it's only when you really memorize this path where it's free we had a donation from owl in a tree saying you know I could have carried you to the star
[430:54.44]Might have been faster.
[430:55.42]It would have been a lot faster.
[430:56.79]He would have been like two minutes faster.
[430:58.21]Oh, we haven't done Aquarium yet.
[430:59.19]Owlus is like, what, three second time save?
[431:01.41]So he can do Aquarium.
[431:02.47]Yeah, it's like four.
[431:03.71]Actually, on this version, I think it might be six with the lag, but it's not a lot of time.
[431:06.95]After what I just saw?
[431:08.29]A second try, I think, is slower.
[431:10.67]Honestly, Troy.
[431:12.05]I'm not joking.
[431:12.58]Honestly.
[431:14.15]We might have you do cannon.
[431:17.73]We can just tell you exactly.
[431:18.89]We're both doing 100 points back to back right now.
[431:22.85]100 points is pretty straightforward.
[431:24.47]It's a lot to do with lab reduction in this map and not get trolled by the cycle of the boat.
[431:29.38]Other than that, pretty straightforward.
[431:31.08]Just got to get down that swimming mechanics.
[431:33.52]It's not too bad.
[431:40.24]This is the worst level in the game.
[431:41.83]You think so?
[431:42.39]I think so.
[431:43.19]I mean, mostly because when I watch Liam, it's all I see.
[431:44.95]I'm sorry.
[431:45.74]That's just... I usually just see Wombs.
[431:48.64]That's disrespectful.
[431:49.38]Are we watching the same stage or same stream a little bit?
[431:51.82]Because I see Wombs.
[431:53.11]Okay.
[431:55.17]I think Jolly Roger B is a bit generous.
[431:59.53]I haven't been in this stage in 20 years.
[432:01.02]I don't remember anything.
[432:03.46]What's your next star, Kony?
[432:05.36]The cannon.
[432:05.78]They're going to tell me where to point.
[432:07.10]Oh, that's not too bad.
[432:07.88]That's okay.
[432:08.80]You're giving her a scratch away.
[432:10.30]You can't do it now.
[432:11.08]You can't do that.
[432:11.86]No, they frame-locked.
[432:12.70]Oh, okay.
[432:15.66]Nice.
[432:17.42]Good hundo.
[432:18.02]She's got the cycle perfectly.
[432:20.18]That was clean.
[432:21.18]Very clean red coins, 100 points.
[432:23.02]Alright.
[432:24.22]It was beautiful.
[432:28.22]Thank you, Frog Technology for the 32, Space Animals for the 5, Anonymous for the 50, Shane with the 5, The Eel for the 3, saying, you'll never get the Power Star.
[432:38.70]So he has to do jet stream then.
[432:42.32]We are at $215,000 raised.
[432:43.28]We are trying to get to $250,000 by the end of these 50 hours.
[432:47.18]$50,000 every 10 hours.
[432:48.66]I don't know how to do math.
[432:51.75]Somewhere around there every 10 hours.
[432:52.83]You have to have a count for that.
[432:54.79]But we'll get there.
[432:55.35]There's some division there.
[432:57.07]Yeah, there's maybe some long division too.
[433:01.03]So here, I think we're gonna have Ludwig, and I think this is the eel star.
[433:04.52]So let's see if he knows the timing for swimming down to get the eel.
[433:07.24]The pillar's in its way.
[433:08.63]Oh, no.
[433:09.87]That's tough.
[433:11.73]When you talk about timing.
[433:12.81]Yeah.
[433:13.03]You got this.
[433:15.16]I got this one.
[433:17.90]I just got to hop in the cannon.
[433:20.60]Oh, no, they're changing tracks.
[433:21.80]They're not doing Eel.
[433:22.58]They're going for the Whirlwind one.
[433:24.46]As long as he holds down and times these swims, it shouldn't be bad.
[433:27.44]Otherwise, he will get pushed off.
[433:28.72]Yeah, exactly.
[433:29.29]But the strong swims with lag.
[433:31.09]Swim, baby.
[433:32.25]Oh.
[433:34.31]Yeah, usually with the swims being kind of off time, 45 degrees usually makes it clean.
[433:39.91]He's switching strat on the fly to the eel, it looks like.
[433:43.01]Oh.
[433:43.77]Yep.
[433:44.84]Right.
[433:46.02]Okay.
[433:46.28]And Coney at the same time, by the way, is lining up the shot.
[433:48.76]Oh, they don't remember the lineup.
[433:50.52]It's muscle memory.
[433:51.56]There we go.
[433:52.72]Aim towards this thing right here.
[433:53.90]Ludwig does get the eel perfectly timed, though.
[433:56.20]Incredible.
[433:56.94]And Coney got this knife here.
[433:58.78]Send it, send it.
[434:00.01]Send it, send it, send it, send it.
[434:01.83]Oh, shit.
[434:02.55]No!
[434:03.98]You have to go back.
[434:05.30]You should not have listened to me.
[434:07.38]Ludwig got the jet stream?
[434:08.28]No, no, no.
[434:09.17]He got the eel.
[434:10.57]That's a good backup there.
[434:11.61]That's a smart move.
[434:14.11]We're trying to figure out the cannon.
[434:16.33]You guys don't know the cannon?
[434:19.06]It's different.
[434:20.40]It's different.
[434:22.96]This is where it would be entertaining to have one of us runners here, because we would know this beginner strat.
[434:30.91]I'm going to tell you, I've never entered Jolly Roger's Bay in my entire life.
[434:34.16]Thank you.
[434:34.96]They let me miss it the first time.
[434:37.44]You didn't play this as a kid?
[434:39.38]Sorry, maybe 20 years ago.
[434:41.10]Jeremy's done?
[434:41.90]Jeremy done?
[434:42.78]Jeremy done?
[434:43.95]At the same time, by the way, they're just one Aquarium Star off.
[434:47.35]It is very close.
[434:48.13]They're going up right now to the race.
[434:53.47]12.6?
[434:53.51]Take your predictions in the chat right now.
[434:55.59]And I recommend everybody to donate whatever time each team gets.
[435:00.51]Let's get a train for that time.
[435:02.45]You could do slide.
[435:05.69]I could do wing cap.
[435:06.37]It would be out of order.
[435:10.06]I just realized we gotta do slide twice, right?
[435:12.30]Yeah, so I think you guys both do slide, then I'll do one cup.
[435:16.94]12.6, not bad.
[435:17.58]Can we get a 12.6 train?
[435:20.61]Chat, you heard Linkus.
[435:21.97]You know what to do.
[435:22.51]12.6 train, come on, we got this.
[435:25.01]For the Mario.
[435:26.15]You can just do long slide.
[435:31.37]Did I hear that Kony's just gonna do the slide raw?
[435:33.87]I don't know the bouncing.
[435:35.00]Yeah, you're just going all the way down.
[435:35.82]I never had to learn that.
[435:36.84]No worries, no worries.
[435:38.70]So I think it's interesting here.
[435:39.86]Ludwig's overconfidence might risk them some time here.
[435:44.11]They told him to do long slide, and he said, I want to do wing cap.
[435:48.09]So let's see if he gets all these red points.
[435:49.75]This is a very hard start.
[435:51.59]Wing cap is scary.
[435:52.58]It is.
[435:53.34]That slow and steady technique is nice, though.
[435:55.12]It's kind of beautiful, though.
[435:56.20]Yeah.
[435:56.70]That was kind of amazing.
[435:57.68]He gets it.
[435:58.94]It looked easy.
[436:00.04]Yeah.
[436:00.36]I think his teammates scared him.
[436:02.75]Yeah.
[436:03.35]He said, I've got this.
[436:04.23]And they were like, I don't know, buddy.
[436:06.65]And the tech skip.
[436:08.15]Beautiful.
[436:09.53]Also, I'm seeing on top there, are we getting 12.6?
[436:11.49]Is it working?
[436:12.34]Is your train starting?
[436:14.14]We are.
[436:14.70]Kemp get with 12.6.
[436:15.32]Anonymous with 12.6.
[436:15.90]Anonymous with 12.6.
[436:16.64]Quorum with 10.
[436:17.02]That's only $2.60 off.
[436:17.56]And then Max and Marissa who gave 100.
[436:19.02]And that's a lot of 12.6.
[436:19.60]Thank you, everybody, so much.
[436:20.80]I'm finding that for the first time.
[436:27.53]like when you actually played casually, like years ago, you felt like you discovered the secrets of the universe.
[436:31.69]The first one, no, you do the two slow ones.
[436:32.87]Oh, I'm like, wait, I can look up and I go to a secret level?
[436:35.22]It was like, oh my god.
[436:35.98]I jump in this?
[436:36.62]That's not even a painting.
[436:37.38]That's not even a painting.
[436:38.50]Every window, you just bump your head against because you're like, maybe this is the one.
[436:42.22]I will do bumping.
[436:43.08]No, it's good to go down face first.
[436:45.58]It's way faster.
[436:46.86]Oh, no.
[436:47.04]Kony went on his forward part, so he cannot do the shortcut.
[436:50.21]Oh, he doesn't know the shortcut.
[436:51.03]He's doing long slide.
[436:52.05]He doesn't know the shortcut.
[436:53.67]Yeah, he said he's going all the way down the slide.
[436:55.15]Oh, wow.
[436:55.65]That is a conversation that they had.
[436:56.99]Oh, we've been through Dark World.
[436:58.33]There are so many ways.
[436:59.99]I'm sorry.
[437:00.75]It is hard to keep up right now.
[437:02.35]Yeah, Dark World.
[437:03.09]Wait, you're right.
[437:03.63]Why do we do that?
[437:04.51]Oh, right.
[437:04.93]OK.
[437:08.06]What is happening with Alexa here?
[437:09.54]Did they do a save-and-quit accident?
[437:11.64]I honestly... What happened, guys?
[437:14.22]Why are they outside the castle?
[437:15.54]One of them died.
[437:16.16]Nothing happened.
[437:18.74]You should lose a star if you die, actually.
[437:20.64]I was too busy watching you just slide down the floor.
[437:24.62]I think they did a save-and-quit, because on N64, you get a lag if you click continue and it saves.
[437:29.52]So you want to go down to continue, don't save.
[437:32.87]Right.
[437:33.77]And it's easy because it's the middle options.
[437:35.59]It's easy to go to the middle and go out.
[437:38.77]Now, this is one of my favorite stages.
[437:42.51]This is also, I think, the pinnacle.
[437:43.77]If you're learning Mario 64, this is the first stage where you will ever learn a pro strap.
[437:49.57]Shigeru cycle.
[437:50.29]I'm pretty sure everyone at home have heard that term if they watch Mario 64.
[437:55.36]And for some of the people that are maybe blood buds that are like, I love when he watches Mr. Beast, explain the Shigeru's like this.
[438:00.10]Okay, alright.
[438:00.82]Sure, of course.
[438:01.42]Hey, get back to running, buddy.
[438:03.20]So you see this yellow part that is moving right there on these platforms?
[438:06.16]Yes.
[438:06.32]They're all in a cycle, and it starts as you enter the stage.
[438:09.62]And during the years, better and better players have come out to discover, wait, you can have this movement to make an earlier cycle so you don't have to wait.
[438:17.72]And it is named after them.
[438:19.28]So Shigeru is an incredible Japanese Mario 64 owner that discovered this.
[438:23.42]I want to say it's like 1520.
[438:24.94]20 years ago.
[438:25.78]Oh, Shigeru didn't.
[438:28.11]He did not make this threat?
[438:29.35]Is it not?
[438:29.77]Hello?
[438:30.45]Is this not Shigeru?
[438:31.27]That was Shigeru, yeah.
[438:32.13]Yeah, okay, I was going to say.
[438:33.15]Was he the one who cheated?
[438:34.27]No, that was... Easy to say.
[438:37.07]Yeah.
[438:38.05]Tainted name.
[438:38.97]Somebody cheated.
[438:39.89]Can't remember who.
[438:40.49]Yeah.
[438:41.57]Yeah, so you will see here on the right side of Coney's screen, they will jump out to the island and then jump here, and you see it's moving out as they're doing, and they can do a dive.
[438:48.56]Okay, normally you could do a dive onto that, so you don't ever have to wait.
[438:51.46]That's Shigeru's cycle right there.
[438:53.04]Got it.
[438:55.01]Beautiful.
[438:55.47]Thankfully none of them died, though, which is good.
[438:57.13]That scared me.
[439:00.75]Wait, are you guys switching for the key or what?
[439:02.11]Yeah, so we have one gets star and then one kills Bowser.
[439:04.79]Oh, I'll kill Bowser.
[439:05.81]Oh, that's perfect.
[439:06.35]You got his ass.
[439:06.99]Yeah, you have to keep the same order.
[439:08.61]Okay, don't fall off.
[439:09.45]Go into the green pipe.
[439:11.07]That is low confidence right there.
[439:15.11]That's good advice is what it is.
[439:17.73]Brutal.
[439:18.65]We're very well coordinated over here.
[439:23.32]I would never scare you, Ron.
[439:24.74]Thank you.
[439:27.12]First try, baby.
[439:28.71]The Kony special.
[439:29.55]Nice.
[439:30.11]Nice.
[439:30.81]That was a clean Bowser throw from Kony.
[439:32.32]It took me two throws.
[439:33.64]Really?
[439:34.22]Did he fall off?
[439:35.94]Yeah, but not in... Yeah.
[439:38.32]He's heavy, man.
[439:39.09]He's heavy.
[439:40.57]Alright.
[439:46.38]Here we go.
[439:47.34]So I think the thing about Bomb here is that it's not as easy to route out the different kind of beginner stars for Coney and Ludwig because a lot of these stars are really long despite it being the first stage.
[439:58.64]Meaning Slow Moon can really lose a lot of time.
[440:01.08]Both already got the free star as the first one.
[440:05.68]You don't get anything because you get it when he gets up there, right?
[440:07.88]Bomb Bomb King might honestly be better.
[440:09.30]Can you do Bomb Bomb King?
[440:10.05]Yeah, you can do Bomb Bomb King.
[440:11.97]I beat his ass.
[440:13.22]The Koopa time loss is dramatic.
[440:15.12]Like, if he takes a minute to get up, it's crazy.
[440:17.60]Yeah, a little bit.
[440:20.14]Wait, my mic is on.
[440:20.89]Oh, the mics are working?
[440:22.01]Have I?
[440:22.29]Yeah.
[440:22.55]Oh, beautiful.
[440:23.05]What am I doing?
[440:23.91]Chat.
[440:24.07]Oh, wait.
[440:24.31]What just happened?
[440:25.07]How is the mic?
[440:31.34]Way too dank?
[440:31.94]Are we way too dank?
[440:32.66]I think it might be an echo because all of them are also close to each other, perhaps.
[440:37.46]Yeah, it has to be.
[440:40.52]Chat, please let me know if we are way too dank right now.
[440:43.97]We're probably pretty dank.
[440:45.09]It is a lot of voices.
[440:48.86]Right here on the left, by the way, they're doing the Koopa race, and something very important to note is that you might think Koopa has a set path.
[440:54.85]However, he kind of has like a rubber band effect.
[440:56.71]Okay, I want you to know that one of the teams is literally listening to Get Tech.
[440:59.29]I didn't know that.
[441:00.35]Has a rubber band effect.
[441:01.23]So because he does get it in only 19 seconds, the Koopa will actually now speed up and go much faster, and that's why he comes back down to unlock this cannon.
[441:10.10]It saves a huge amount of time, because otherwise the Koopas are really slow.
[441:14.06]So you want to go fast here, and that's why we're doing this whole converted thing.
[441:17.44]Wink up.
[441:18.20]And you're going to see her when she comes back.
[441:20.15]By the way, with this route being perfectly aligned, he will get back up here before.
[441:24.43]Okay, I think Koopa is probably right.
[441:26.09]I think Koopa has even made it.
[441:27.63]Well, I am, but... Okay, maybe... Okay, nice.
[441:32.25]Ignore what I'm doing.
[441:33.00]Yeah.
[441:37.06]I got you.
[441:37.70]Thank you.
[441:38.28]Normally, you get up before the Koopa is up.
[441:41.08]He's not that quick.
[441:42.04]He's quick, man.
[441:42.88]He's not that quick.
[441:43.90]Are you sure?
[441:44.52]You can be faster.
[441:45.30]Say yes when he asks for it.
[441:47.03]Okay.
[441:49.36]These backseatings are almost like insult.
[441:52.02]Please go in the blue pipe.
[441:54.42]Please say yes to his dialog.
[441:56.44]Our best player died in Jolly Roger Bay.
[441:58.84]I don't know what happened.
[442:00.02]I don't know what happened.
[442:00.84]It was a freak accident.
[442:02.74]What star were you doing?
[442:03.68]Were you trying to get in the ship?
[442:04.85]Yeah, I was doing a ship clip.
[442:06.17]Yeah, I couldn't clip.
[442:07.13]Where you go on the island in the box.
[442:09.30]Do you want to do that one?
[442:10.24]No, you're good.
[442:10.65]Yeah, the island.
[442:11.61]It's like the easiest one left.
[442:12.69]The scenic route.
[442:14.39]Is it the scenic route?
[442:15.43]Yes.
[442:15.77]It's the easiest star, man.
[442:17.09]Hold on.
[442:17.52]Let me just view it for you.
[442:18.54]But don't kick too much.
[442:19.26]Don't kick too much.
[442:20.12]Chill, chill, chill, chill.
[442:22.26]Chill.
[442:23.42]It can turn it.
[442:23.95]Okay, you're good.
[442:24.37]Yeah, you're good.
[442:25.03]I'll tell you tomorrow.
[442:26.41]No, no, you're good.
[442:27.29]That was good.
[442:29.27]All the way up.
[442:29.97]There are so many voices at the same time.
[442:32.59]We can sit back.
[442:33.29]Look at that.
[442:34.91]Oh, shit.
[442:35.33]Careful.
[442:35.71]That was fantastic.
[442:37.37]Oh, shit.
[442:37.90]That was beautiful, actually.
[442:39.84]I'm actually surprised.
[442:41.02]First try.
[442:42.02]Jeez, do you want to do 100, or should I do the cannon?
[442:45.16]You do 100.
[442:45.42]You've done 200 so far.
[442:46.20]You should probably do it.
[442:47.68]Koopa the Quake is kind of slow, actually.
[442:50.50]It can take kind of a while.
[442:53.11]It's actually pathetic.
[442:53.95]Where did he go?
[442:54.59]He's very slow.
[442:58.01]Normally, you'd open the cannon during this time, but... No, I... But that's okay.
[443:01.85]We don't need to worry about that.
[443:03.11]You just need to get the star.
[443:04.67]Where's Koopa?
[443:05.57]Look how crazy it is, though.
[443:07.02]Chey, you guys see that?
[443:07.84]Like, if he did... Is it on?
[443:09.78]Chey, you see that shit?
[443:11.26]Is it on?
[443:11.64]No, shit.
[443:12.56]Is Koopa coming?
[443:13.66]He's there, he's there, he's there.
[443:15.18]Talk to him.
[443:15.68]Oh, there he is.
[443:16.12]I have to tell him yes for the star, right?
[443:18.20]Okay, yes.
[443:18.80]Please give me the star.
[443:19.37]Nice.
[443:20.81]So while the long star is going on and they're waiting, do we have any donations coming in right now that we can read?
[443:25.16]Oh, do we have any donations?
[443:27.96]Cantz with the $12, Mips with the $2, Anonymous with the $5, Northern Lions, hold.
[443:33.61]Hairline with the $25.
[443:35.15]Hairline.
[443:35.85]I am Tendo with the $64, saying SimpleFlips and Coney are my two favorite entertainers easily, and it's not close, and I definitely don't have a favorite.
[443:43.43]It's SimpleFlips.
[443:45.69]That's their donation.
[443:46.77]That's their donation.
[443:49.77]Can I get $1,000 for Kony?
[443:51.53]Kony over SimpleFlips?
[443:52.57]True.
[443:53.69]Yeah, I guess I can stand for that.
[443:55.71]Thanks.
[443:56.51]Double mic me.
[443:58.19]Double mic.
[444:02.61]What's my next star?
[444:04.83]Only one person on this team has died, by the way.
[444:07.18]SSL.
[444:07.28]CCL.
[444:07.60]Oh, wait.
[444:08.20]Yeah, SSL.
[444:08.50]I guess MIPS.
[444:09.20]Yeah, MIPS.
[444:13.91]I love getting missed.
[444:15.31]That's true.
[444:17.97]I got through the hard part, which was the bomb clip.
[444:20.41]Thank goodness.
[444:21.79]I mean, you haven't died.
[444:23.41]Someone on your team has.
[444:25.17]You didn't die yet.
[444:26.27]I didn't die.
[444:26.91]Okay.
[444:28.11]I've actually played a clean-ass run.
[444:30.01]Well, other than the owl.
[444:31.97]Okay.
[444:32.29]I just wanted to donate to charity.
[444:34.49]Maybe that makes me a criminal.
[444:37.21]I can't believe you hit lax skip.
[444:38.57]That's kind of hard, man.
[444:40.39]Honestly, I can't either.
[444:42.96]The Hori pad is kind of good.
[444:44.48]It's broken.
[444:45.30]Are you feeling it?
[444:46.22]It's good.
[444:47.14]It's like a GameCube controller, but it has buttons for Mario.
[444:49.87]Let's get it.
[444:50.23]Oh, hell yeah!
[444:56.47]Anyway, I pointed him, the team leader, over here.
[444:58.93]A guy who's a Liam sub in chat said, would anyone else fucking miss?
[445:02.21]He's Mr. 120.
[445:03.29]Whoa!
[445:04.45]I'm just reading messages.
[445:05.41]Maybe that... That's a Liam message.
[445:07.43]Yeah, is that your chat, Liam?
[445:08.35]Alright, we're back.
[445:09.21]Hello?
[445:09.59]Is that represented?
[445:10.41]No, not at all.
[445:11.45]No?
[445:11.85]No.
[445:12.76]I love the polls.
[445:13.74]Spit them around.
[445:14.34]Oh, should we go headset?
[445:18.22]Are we killing sticks?
[445:18.92]Probably.
[445:20.86]Yes.
[445:21.36]Now it's Conan Street.
[445:22.44]Oh, my gosh.
[445:23.99]Spin them around, Simply.
[445:25.35]Get real dizzy.
[445:27.75]Do it again.
[445:28.41]About to make them bust.
[445:31.18]Don't do that, Simply.
[445:33.14]Don't do that.
[445:33.76]That's too much.
[445:35.24]Let them go, Simply.
[445:36.41]Just one more.
[445:39.75]Oh, I still do.
[445:43.67]Alright.
[445:45.13]There we go.
[445:45.61]Broke out all 100.
[445:46.71]What am I doing here?
[445:48.47]Nips, you go to basement.
[445:50.42]Catch the rest.
[445:51.06]We're going to cook them.
[445:52.36]It's about to get so much harder.
[445:53.66]These are like the tutorial levels, and we're going to basement.
[445:58.74]Shit's about to get real.
[445:59.92]Five secrets left?
[446:01.52]Yeah.
[446:05.90]Yeah, so far it's pretty close, honestly.
[446:07.88]Closer than I thought.
[446:08.86]But like they were saying, now we're coming into the harder stages where you can't just give away one or two of the free stars.
[446:15.68]Yeah, what's considered the worst part of this 120 run?
[446:19.40]Oh, Rainbow Ride and TikTok Clock.
[446:22.06]I forgot we have to play Rainbow Ride.
[446:24.36]Yeah, Cony.
[446:25.42]Cony, go back to your stick.
[446:26.30]Something's wrong.
[446:26.98]He looks terrified.
[446:30.57]Yeah, because in those stages, one fall, insta-death.
[446:34.45]It is tight.
[446:36.11]It's going to be rough.
[446:40.04]Very nice MIPS grab, though.
[446:44.18]Nice.
[446:46.58]Wait, it's your turn.
[446:47.60]Is it?
[446:48.14]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[446:48.84]Oh, let's keep him honest here.
[446:50.17]When I was 12 years old, I chased that fucking rabbit around.
[446:53.69]Figurates forever.
[446:55.23]I just didn't get it, and I just, like, I just... Slow zoom on Jerma while saying that.
[446:59.91]Oh, I can do that.
[447:01.16]Well, actually, I don't know.
[447:02.42]I go through hazy maces.
[447:03.76]Do we swap on it?
[447:04.38]That wascally rabbit, I was trying to get him.
[447:06.60]You guys swapped on mips, right?
[447:08.70]Oh, shit.
[447:09.42]Okay.
[447:10.38]I think it's every star, every key, except for 100.
[447:13.23]Thank God.
[447:14.45]Basically.
[447:14.87]Nice.
[447:16.07]Pillarless is one of those glitches that are one of the hardest to do in the run.
[447:19.63]They do the exploit to get it big.
[447:21.45]However, they need to cause a kind of delay so it doesn't kind of explode in their hand.
[447:25.66]It's very difficult to maneuver.
[447:27.18]I only get MIPS through the haste maze way.
[447:29.90]Do like reds or something.
[447:31.50]Everett says it's hard to grind it for six hours.
[447:33.14]I did it once.
[447:34.60]You did get it once in six hours.
[447:36.04]Wait.
[447:36.97]Next time, next time it comes around, next time Coney's don't want to catch it.
[447:39.67]Oh, he missed.
[447:40.31]Oh, wait.
[447:40.95]Oh, here we go.
[447:41.41]Oh, this is the Jerma.
[447:42.73]Yep.
[447:43.73]Oh, no.
[447:44.63]Lead him to the dead end, Coney.
[447:46.41]Where'd he go?
[447:47.33]Oh, no.
[447:47.67]Not that way.
[447:48.63]I mean, it's fine.
[447:49.93]Get him.
[447:50.19]Get him.
[447:50.61]Get him.
[447:51.21]Oh, I thought that would get him on the slide.
[447:52.75]No, no, no.
[447:53.32]Dude, you run 16 stars.
[447:54.42]Just take him to the corner.
[447:55.80]No, but that's what I did.
[447:56.88]Okay.
[447:57.30]Okay.
[447:57.62]We got it.
[447:57.96]We got it.
[447:58.26]They're in your head.
[447:58.92]This is great.
[447:59.28]I know the thing.
[447:59.68]I know the thing.
[448:00.32]I know the thing you're supposed to do, which is like you do the fucking.
[448:04.14]You know the thing.
[448:04.92]And then you slow.
[448:05.98]Yes.
[448:09.04]Too bad.
[448:10.32]No, no, no.
[448:11.38]It's cool.
[448:11.68]It's cool.
[448:12.12]It's cool.
[448:12.66]It's coming back.
[448:14.18]My mother's calling me to dinner.
[448:15.48]I've been here for three hours.
[448:17.05]Okay.
[448:17.31]We got it.
[448:17.65]We got it.
[448:18.27]Okay.
[448:24.30]Dude!
[448:24.72]Back on the stick.
[448:25.38]Oh, okay.
[448:25.74]Do we have the stick?
[448:27.02]Oh, this isn't working.
[448:30.30]Unless we're fixing it.
[448:31.04]We should have some coding problems.
[448:32.11]That's still good.
[448:32.73]That was a little bit scary.
[448:34.43]They weren't into your vibe, I guess.
[448:37.21]Dude, I only know how to do that from the Hazy Maze entrance.
[448:40.21]You didn't know how to loop him back around.
[448:41.85]I practiced for 16.
[448:42.45]Oh, no.
[448:49.82]that is crazy to invite coney tell him he's going to be running 16 star and then like hey you're gonna have to do 40 stars in that you've never seen oh oh never mind cody you're good now you're good on my back my back you can use that you're good yeah which star currently is ludwig doing is he doing on top of pyramid okay
[449:12.59]Nice.
[449:14.15]He had the backup.
[449:14.69]He's good.
[449:15.75]Oh, man.
[449:16.51]I'll do 100.
[449:18.27]Can you do it without bird?
[449:20.77]Yes.
[449:21.21]Okay.
[449:22.63]You might hit him.
[449:23.51]Okay.
[449:24.45]I don't think it's a high chance.
[449:26.89]Never mind.
[449:28.39]He lost it.
[449:30.73]I got robbed.
[449:32.07]Did you miss one?
[449:33.66]Yeah.
[449:34.06]Sometimes a coin just becomes intangible in the pillar.
[449:37.58]It, like, lands the same time it spawns or something weird like that.
[449:40.66]Alright, leave the boing for me.
[449:42.62]We will.
[449:44.34]Alright, chat, I'm adding a match donation for the 700 that I owe.
[449:51.55]I owe 700, was it?
[449:52.53]You do owe 700, plus whatever the like differential is.
[449:55.05]I can check right now.
[449:58.47]Chat, how many likes are we at?
[450:01.19]Please show the 1K dono.
[450:02.39]Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[450:03.37]I was talking to Kony.
[450:04.43]Let me try and find it.
[450:09.13]Regnillo with $1,000.
[450:10.45]$1,000 for Kony.
[450:12.25]He is cool.
[450:14.13]That's true.
[450:14.80]Thank you, Regnillo.
[450:15.78]Thank you.
[450:16.98]Damn, he asked for a $1,000 donut.
[450:18.52]He got a $1,000 donut.
[450:19.54]He really did.
[450:21.14]He probably did it before the MIPS thing.
[450:23.70]He actually just refunded.
[450:26.24]So weird.
[450:27.36]Alright, I'm matching for Turek.
[450:34.93]Which is 700 from... 700 plus 1,300.
[450:36.82]You're 1,300 higher.
[450:38.86]They're saying you're at 93,000 likes.
[450:40.10]93,000.
[450:40.12]That's 900 plus 700.
[450:40.54]1,600.
[450:41.88]That's cool.
[450:42.24]Yarp.
[450:50.30]A $1,600 match.
[450:51.46]So you'll be matching the next $1,600 once it goes through.
[450:53.34]Yes.
[450:54.38]Alright, chat.
[450:54.88]If you want your donation to count for double in just a second, Ludwig is going to set up some matching.
[450:59.91]You just have to go to obp.gg slash donate and help us get to $250,000.
[451:06.19]Very nice.
[451:06.69]Approaching 220.
[451:07.41]Yeah, we're approaching 220.
[451:09.51]It's been done.
[451:10.07]Welcome to the Death Club.
[451:11.05]It's been done.
[451:12.65]Ladies and gentlemen.
[451:13.47]Both my team has died, by the way.
[451:15.37]They both died.
[451:16.13]Wait, how did Silverflake die?
[451:17.57]Really?
[451:18.01]He's doing Pillarless.
[451:18.79]Oh, they dared me to.
[451:19.87]Oh.
[451:20.89]Dared you to die?
[451:21.87]It was looking so good, too.
[451:22.92]Wouldn't that be so funny?
[451:24.70]Wait, this is crazy if you get this.
[451:26.22]Oh, you're a demon.
[451:33.59]What is going on on the right side of the screen right now?
[451:36.65]He's trying to get into the roof of the pyramid here.
[451:41.59]There we go.
[451:44.16]Very nice.
[451:45.06]So many speedrunning tricks look absurd and you're like, I don't really get what he's doing until they fly.
[451:50.08]That's where they're going.
[451:51.52]I cannot believe I did that.
[451:52.62]That was good as hell.
[451:58.37]You know, this run is going very smoothly.
[452:00.27]Shifting Sandlin in general has been pretty clean from both sides.
[452:02.49]Small mistakes overall, but it is doing pretty good.
[452:05.60]Right now, it looks like they're kind of just doing some cleanup.
[452:07.94]They're going inside to fight the hands.
[452:09.54]Get that boink.
[452:10.26]You're way too late.
[452:11.18]Yeah, they're going for the bird on the right.
[452:13.16]Hold A. You might be able to.
[452:14.30]Hold A. Oh.
[452:16.71]Oh, he's getting more head.
[452:17.89]Oh, God.
[452:18.49]Okay.
[452:19.03]It's cool.
[452:19.73]Does he know the backup?
[452:21.23]Just go over to that pillar that he's in.
[452:22.55]No, we don't.
[452:23.15]Jump, jump, jump.
[452:24.53]No.
[452:26.07]Hey, what's going on?
[452:29.21]Let's go.
[452:29.49]We've all died.
[452:31.04]so these gentlemen they are being matched robbie thank you for the one hundred anonymous thank you Matthew thank you clay thank you Jake thank you Jack thank you missus artistic Tony's on path can you get the bird yes yeah I just forget it was like you have to get it is going out and I have to point it out there's nobody else at that point pressure
[452:52.40]Jump.
[452:52.88]Oh, my God.
[452:54.14]He waited so late for that.
[452:55.88]Yeah, yeah, it freaked me out.
[452:57.30]No, it's perfect.
[452:58.10]That's normal.
[452:58.74]Yeah, well, that was good.
[453:00.24]But the last time you got sucked under the pyramid.
[453:02.10]Oh, no.
[453:03.64]Let's see if Ludwig can do better than Coney.
[453:05.28]He is on a side path.
[453:06.66]Oh, he's got the point.
[453:07.36]Yeah, he's fine.
[453:08.18]He knows how to hold.
[453:09.08]Oh, Lord.
[453:09.70]Yeah, he's fine.
[453:11.66]Oh, you too.
[453:12.88]I'm a fibber.
[453:13.68]Right, right.
[453:15.75]Oh.
[453:15.85]Oh, my God.
[453:18.93]He got it.
[453:19.91]He's got it.
[453:21.93]What?
[453:24.81]Okay.
[453:27.50]Throw a little backflip in there.
[453:28.76]I didn't know you could do that.
[453:31.36]Well, you died before you got to that pillar.
[453:34.22]I was trying to go up the pyramid.
[453:36.52]I have a six-hour 120-star PB.
[453:38.45]You should have messed with me.
[453:40.29]Oh, that shit hurts.
[453:43.55]Ouch.
[453:43.83]That could have been way worse.
[453:45.43]Wait, Coney, how many stars do you guys have?
[453:48.23]How many what?
[453:48.83]How many stars are you guys at?
[453:49.77]31.
[453:49.79]33.
[453:49.85]Wait, we told the truth?
[453:52.22]31?
[453:52.40]Yeah, they're currently at 31, finishing at the 32nd one.
[453:56.38]Team Ludwig is going into HMC right now, and they're starting off with one of the hardest stars in the game in terms of the speedrun, HMC 100.
[454:04.77]It is a brutal stage, and it's also very strict with the coins, so hopefully it doesn't miss anything else.
[454:12.08]It's very difficult.
[454:12.72]They're going to start this cycle right here.
[454:14.82]And he's kind of trying.
[454:15.78]Yeah, you can hear right there.
[454:18.14]Runners don't like it.
[454:19.36]They're going to have to wait.
[454:20.80]Yeah, it takes so long to ride this thing.
[454:22.20]You try and activate it.
[454:23.36]And if you're not on it for about five seconds, it despawns.
[454:26.10]Just trying to make it back there in time.
[454:27.52]It's difficult.
[454:29.32]And it's so slow.
[454:30.12]You're going to see they're going to try and parkour up here.
[454:32.10]I'm terrified.
[454:35.54]And let's see if they can get these jumps.
[454:37.41]Very precise.
[454:39.40]authority gets it okay that's my going saves about twenty seconds of riding around there things you don't want to hear and as a result of the uh... now we gotta figure it out we're good I just learned something that I'll never leave yeah
[455:03.96]Oh, Kony was excited to fight this guy.
[455:05.95]Thank God I don't have to.
[455:06.93]He's scary.
[455:07.89]You want the controller, Kony?
[455:08.89]No, no, no.
[455:09.37]You kill him.
[455:11.92]A cool glitch is coming up here on Team Ludwig's side.
[455:14.32]We're actually going to see one of the few BLJs in the run.
[455:18.08]It is so slow to run around to the other side.
[455:20.72]They're going to try and use the elevator to actually set up a BLJ by getting stuck in the floor as it's moving upwards, which is backwards long jumps.
[455:27.30]Basically, there's no speed cap from going backwards.
[455:29.42]He's going to triple jump through the floor, line up, and if he gets this, let's see.
[455:34.26]He clips right through it.
[455:35.76]Incredible job.
[455:37.65]That was very clean.
[455:38.67]That's my favorite trick.
[455:40.45]Y'all clapping?
[455:41.07]He's 100% on that.
[455:41.83]He's never missed that, ever.
[455:44.53]Never.
[455:45.31]They called the Liam BLJ.
[455:47.26]That's true.
[455:49.74]First thing he said on commentary.
[455:51.86]So true.
[455:54.04]You good?
[455:54.32]They patched it.
[455:55.32]Liam only says positive things.
[455:56.84]That's it.
[455:57.22]That's his rule.
[455:59.95]Oh, see, that's a Stan star that Kony's getting.
[456:02.20]Yes, sir.
[456:02.60]Oh, nice.
[456:03.91]Beautiful.
[456:04.57]OK.
[456:08.37]Can you do level 50?
[456:09.95]Thank you, Ian, for the 50.
[456:11.15]Anonymous for the 50.
[456:12.65]Legal, I'm not going to read some of these, but thank you for the money.
[456:15.53]Oh, that's great.
[456:18.23]What do you know in HMC?
[456:19.75]Very little.
[456:21.23]Okay.
[456:22.33]Maybe you take a toad break.
[456:23.79]Tony, you can go down the elevator.
[456:26.53]You can go across.
[456:27.21]You can go up in that little room.
[456:28.93]I know the dory.
[456:29.85]I'm going to take a toad break.
[456:32.35]That's good.
[456:32.84]I like that.
[456:34.47]Do you need water or anything?
[456:35.61]Maybe I'll go grab a water after.
[456:40.21]I'm like, should I try the BLJ?
[456:41.71]Yeah, and get Rolling Rocks if you fuck it up.
[456:44.47]Damn it.
[456:45.41]Okay, they're going for a crazy strat here.
[456:48.16]This was something that is actually one of the more recent big implementation in 120 Star.
[456:52.78]It used to be kind of single segment or used for shorter categories.
[456:56.96]However, some runners nowadays do go for it.
[456:59.22]Cheese is going to go for it.
[456:59.98]If he doesn't get it, which it is likely because it's such a hard trick, he's going to go for another one.
[457:04.63]So let's see.
[457:05.07]You're in his ear.
[457:07.09]Oh, sorry.
[457:07.69]Let's see if Cheese can do this.
[457:08.97]I don't know if he can.
[457:11.05]He's probably going to fuck this up, though.
[457:12.49]I see him mess this trick up a lot.
[457:16.02]Come on, my goat!
[457:16.92]My goat!
[457:18.34]No!
[457:19.04]Yeah, it's a hard trick.
[457:20.12]He should try again, though.
[457:21.12]He should go for it again.
[457:21.88]I could go for it again.
[457:22.84]Yeah, go for it again.
[457:23.78]Fuck it.
[457:24.12]We got a big lead.
[457:25.83]My camera was weird.
[457:26.53]Did you see that?
[457:27.25]I don't even do this one.
[457:28.19]Oh.
[457:35.06]Wait, no.
[457:35.42]I know Rolling Rocks.
[457:36.76]No.
[457:37.68]One more time.
[457:38.14]One more time.
[457:38.84]One more time.
[457:39.28]And my girls at the theater.
[457:41.37]Yee-hoo!
[457:45.75]Chad probably hated that.
[457:49.39]Yeah.
[457:49.81]Nah.
[457:49.99]Alright, alright.
[457:52.83]Back up, back up.
[457:53.31]I'm still going for it.
[457:54.01]Thank you, Joel.
[457:54.80]Thank you, Dank, for the 20.
[457:56.22]Thanks, Stance, for the 10, but it was you that gave the 10, so you're kind of confusing me.
[457:59.34]Lunick, thank you for the 10.
[458:00.98]Are we still matching?
[458:02.40]No, the matching insta.
[458:03.90]Over.
[458:05.24]I know what you're trying to do.
[458:06.20]They stole.
[458:08.06]Bang!
[458:10.48]How did that even happen?
[458:11.94]You can do it again.
[458:12.86]You can go through the other elevator.
[458:14.18]That's just not the right elevator.
[458:16.36]But you did it in your run.
[458:17.98]No.
[458:18.42]That's impossible.
[458:18.88]That's a different deal.
[458:19.84]Wow.
[458:20.22]Leave me, Toad.
[458:21.86]You guys just hate innovation.
[458:23.52]How did I even not get in there?
[458:25.26]Josh, thank you for the 100.
[458:25.98]We have breached $222,222.22.
[458:26.86]That's a lot of twos.
[458:27.85]What happened over there, boys?
[458:29.03]I forgot the Z button!
[458:44.77]Oh.
[458:45.29]Should have talked to Lakitu.
[458:46.73]He tells you how to use the C buttons.
[458:49.26]You said metal cap, or what was the other one?
[458:51.94]Like the button?
[458:52.58]Christmas miracle, yeah.
[458:54.64]OK.
[458:54.92]Christmas miracle?
[458:56.08]Is that a star?
[458:57.00]Yeah.
[458:59.28]Dude, they're talking about tech I've never heard of.
[459:01.38]So this upcoming star that we're going over here for on our setup is called Christmas Miracle because for the longest time, runners didn't know why it worked.
[459:08.03]You'll see he'll do a big jump that hits a switch you need the metal cap for.
[459:12.45]Actually, I don't know where he's going.
[459:14.11]He's not going there.
[459:14.97]We're going somewhere else.
[459:17.25]I'm a little worried about the teamwork.
[459:19.28]Yeah, don't get that one.
[459:20.60]That's a Kony star.
[459:21.18]God!
[459:21.42]Very rare!
[459:21.86]What the hell was that?
[459:27.53]I just suck at mashups.
[459:31.33]I'm going to visit an old friend.
[459:33.30]Is that better or worse than what I just did?
[459:34.98]He has it now, right?
[459:36.34]Probably similar.
[459:37.00]Does he have it?
[459:37.70]Yeah, he has it.
[459:39.12]That little bastard.
[459:40.52]Okay, here we go.
[459:41.24]I'm visiting an old friend.
[459:43.11]Oh, the punch!
[459:43.95]My bad, my bad.
[459:45.05]Yeah, we better win.
[459:50.61]That's going to be you.
[459:52.79]I'm going to try the thing Cheese went for.
[459:54.93]Just go down there and do it.
[459:57.15]Good to see you again, Coney.
[459:58.85]I'm coming to do that one too.
[460:00.82]Coney's run off the stage.
[460:01.86]He's quit the speedrun.
[460:03.28]Wait.
[460:04.98]Is he going to the bathroom or something?
[460:07.92]He's got two phenomenal speedrunner teammates.
[460:12.25]I'm watching.
[460:12.59]Perfect.
[460:12.77]Look at that.
[460:17.20]How is that happening?
[460:19.02]I don't know.
[460:19.52]Isn't that weird?
[460:20.28]Yeah, I feel like that was perfect.
[460:23.82]I don't know.
[460:24.86]That's not supposed to happen.
[460:28.68]Whatever, dude.
[460:30.50]Whatever you want to do.
[460:32.93]Screw it at this point.
[460:35.17]Who can get the BLJ first?
[460:36.69]Uh-oh.
[460:38.35]S1mple's too good at it.
[460:39.23]He's going to get it.
[460:40.95]How does he even mash like that?
[460:44.14]How do you even... Oh, it's not enough speed.
[460:46.04]Oh, it's not enough.
[460:47.18]Shit.
[460:47.40]This is so bad.
[460:48.30]How many stars left are there?
[460:50.04]Coney said to leave this one for him.
[460:51.39]Yeah, I know.
[460:53.01]Like five, four.
[460:54.33]Oh, shit.
[460:55.55]That's my turn.
[460:57.75]Metal cap.
[460:59.83]That BLJ one.
[461:00.21]Three more.
[461:00.79]And then the one in the middle, water.
[461:02.26]Did you see that gay one?
[461:03.88]What did you say?
[461:04.50]Huh?
[461:05.02]What?
[461:05.30]Nothing.
[461:07.76]What?
[461:08.74]I'm a team water boy.
[461:11.00]I don't know what I'm doing.
[461:11.94]I guess I'm doing this one.
[461:13.02]Metalcap.
[461:13.44]That shit's hard.
[461:15.27]Wait, did you guys get the BLJ?
[461:17.39]No.
[461:18.15]It's not happening.
[461:19.91]I don't know.
[461:21.39]It's hard on this.
[461:27.73]I'm dead.
[461:28.21]Oh, my God.
[461:28.95]Oh, they're doing the same star.
[461:30.44]Yeah, and they're 39-39.
[461:31.88]Oh, wow.
[461:32.40]But what did they leave?
[461:33.62]Have they done the exact same in Hades?
[461:35.20]That's so dumb.
[461:35.80]How is my life this right now?
[461:36.86]They might have picked up a few different stars, but the long ones, they've both done now.
[461:41.26]So it is very tight.
[461:45.77]Chad is badgering for a costume change.
[461:49.36]Costume change?
[461:50.02]What am I doing?
[461:51.08]Oh, you could have went for it.
[461:52.57]You'll do it?
[461:53.71]Okay, Ludwig will be doing a costume change after this.
[461:56.13]He's going to have to speed run it as to not let his team down.
[462:01.09]Oh, my God.
[462:03.77]We're losing quite a bit of time on HMC, boys.
[462:05.59]Sam, yeah, remarkably close.
[462:07.33]Yeah, exactly.
[462:08.37]We're within ten seconds of each other.
[462:10.59]That's good.
[462:12.29]Did you guys get towed?
[462:14.31]Oh, okay, there you go.
[462:14.93]There's the lead.
[462:15.97]I forgot that Kony went and got towed.
[462:18.17]What do you guys have left?
[462:21.14]That's an incredible, clever strat, though.
[462:23.50]To get in the middle of the maze.
[462:27.37]Go!
[462:27.91]Don't trip, don't trip, don't trip, don't trip.
[462:34.21]I already got that one.
[462:35.73]You already got this one?
[462:36.91]Maybe just do it normally.
[462:38.31]Go right?
[462:38.99]I don't remember how.
[462:39.95]Up there?
[462:40.33]Just do the triple jump start then.
[462:43.27]Just try to go up here, right?
[462:45.35]Yeah, that works too.
[462:47.53]You got this, King.
[462:48.07]I didn't know you got that one.
[462:49.33]Holy... There you go.
[462:50.89]You guys going for the BLJ again?
[462:52.28]Nice.
[462:52.56]I don't know what we're doing, man.
[462:54.52]There we go.
[462:55.52]Okay.
[462:56.38]Well done.
[462:56.82]Dude, I didn't know you got the rolling rock.
[462:58.86]I was like, holy...
[463:00.90]Wait, do you want to go for it?
[463:01.80]Simply, are you going to go for it?
[463:03.70]Yeah, I'm going to go for it.
[463:04.48]Let's both do it right now.
[463:05.46]Yeah, let's do it.
[463:09.51]Good luck.
[463:10.63]Okay, Ludwig is finna make me act up as Princess Peach.
[463:15.65]Is that what I'm seeing?
[463:16.81]I think so.
[463:18.13]I'm more of a Daisy guy.
[463:19.05]I'll just sit up for this one.
[463:21.93]That's very distracting.
[463:25.05]Here he comes.
[463:26.05]He's late for the ball.
[463:27.29]He lost his glass slipper.
[463:29.77]And he's here!
[463:34.21]Looking fine, by the way.
[463:35.43]It's impossible.
[463:36.90]What do I do?
[463:38.40]Let's go!
[463:39.20]Let's go, team!
[463:40.58]Oh my god, you're so wide.
[463:42.36]You got the last one.
[463:43.64]Oh my god.
[463:45.68]You just ripped the zipper.
[463:49.17]Zip, I'll hold you, Zip.
[463:50.91]Suck it in.
[463:52.56]Alright, screw it.
[463:53.62]They're suited up on that.
[463:57.95]Oh, you're going to be passing out like Keira Knightley in Pirates of the Caribbean 1.
[464:03.15]What outfit did you bring, Sonny?
[464:07.63]I had a witch hat.
[464:09.61]I can't go find something.
[464:11.29]Alright, next 10K is definitely a Kony outfit swap.
[464:14.09]Kony's got a good play.
[464:15.07]Kony, you hear that?
[464:15.89]I got to find something fast.
[464:17.30]230K, you got an outfit swap.
[464:18.12]Okay, you got it, you got it.
[464:20.15]Please donate, I need them too.
[464:21.11]You got a daisy in there?
[464:22.07]Oh yeah.
[464:23.47]We're behind?
[464:24.11]The BLJ situation.
[464:27.42]Yeah, we are.
[464:27.88]The BLJ incident.
[464:28.96]Yeah, we can do like reds.
[464:31.42]As a BLJ situation.
[464:32.32]Alright, the only thing I know here is reds, big dogs.
[464:34.80]Alright.
[464:35.52]You can probably do the wing cap.
[464:36.90]Yeah.
[464:37.88]It'd be so easy.
[464:39.38]Even Coney could pull it off, I feel like.
[464:40.86]Is it?
[464:41.75]He could, he could.
[464:43.67]I believe.
[464:44.03]If he can do these reds, he can do anything.
[464:46.51]I can... Hard to start in the back, yeah.
[464:48.19]I can coach Coney like...
[464:51.66]I'm obsessed with your idea of using Shifting Sand Land, and I call it Stan's Land, so I had a stroke in my head when I said that, and Lethal Lobland.
[464:59.73]They didn't do it because they've already gone there, but the thought of going back and forth so that a Coney could get all the easy stars is huge.
[465:05.07]That's a death over here.
[465:07.23]Sorry, Ludwig died?
[465:08.23]My body's constricted!
[465:09.40]Yeah, it's the dress.
[465:10.58]It's the dress for sure.
[465:12.48]And Coney's team is, by the way, ahead now.
[465:16.13]By one star.
[465:17.28]It was the Simply BLJs, right?
[465:19.60]Yeah.
[465:19.98]Kill him, Simply!
[465:21.26]Nice 50-50 grind.
[465:26.97]Easy.
[465:28.69]Yeah, at this point you can't really go back and forth on the stage.
[465:31.52]You just have to go through these lava lands.
[465:33.26]There's no way around it.
[465:34.82]Where do I go?
[465:35.36]Do you guys need water?
[465:36.34]Uh, yeah, sure.
[465:38.74]Wow, he scores.
[465:39.46]Just tear out of that really quick.
[465:40.92]He just fits in perfectly.
[465:42.71]Fits in perfectly.
[465:44.11]You'll just immediately long jump over there.
[465:47.01]Ladies and gentlemen, I just got a notice from production.
[465:50.19]The crab bounty, the moist critical bounty will be ending soon.
[465:53.53]If you're at home, if you are enthralled by this gameplay and forgot, better get your run started.
[465:57.68]We do not have much time left.
[465:58.86]What time is it right now?
[466:01.86]It's 4.53.
[466:02.56]That's like 10 minutes.
[466:07.73]So I'm flying over the cage, right?
[466:09.37]Get them in.
[466:09.75]Get the ones in.
[466:10.23]10 minutes.
[466:10.57]Get them in.
[466:11.81]Just go that direction, and once you get to the archway, we'll explain.
[466:15.84]Or like elevator.
[466:17.42]You got this, King.
[466:18.28]Why are you making me nervous?
[466:20.25]There's a subset of people on the internet that live for this right now.
[466:25.01]And I'm one of them.
[466:25.61]Look at the wing cap.
[466:26.83]Yeah.
[466:27.33]Hey, beautiful.
[466:28.23]Hey, do you know where to go?
[466:29.45]Go that way.
[466:29.91]Pretty lady.
[466:30.57]Go straight.
[466:30.85]Go straight.
[466:31.17]Let me guide you.
[466:31.69]Alright, where are we going, pretty lady?
[466:34.10]Laying on this gray thing.
[466:35.20]Wait, did Coney do this?
[466:36.24]On the gray thing?
[466:37.02]I think it would be so hot if you landed in the lava.
[466:39.52]Wait, why do I land on the gray thing?
[466:40.96]Because it would be so hot.
[466:42.38]Oh, OK.
[466:42.56]It would be so hot if you went in the lava for me.
[466:44.22]Oh, I see.
[466:45.02]I see.
[466:45.84]Without moving.
[466:46.46]Oh, thank you.
[466:47.02]You just got to be an easier star here.
[466:49.06]Right?
[466:50.87]No, this is actually one of these.
[466:52.43]As long as you get that triple jump, he just has to land right here.
[466:55.89]You see?
[466:56.21]Yeah, you're right.
[466:59.29]And that's a hard one, too.
[467:00.93]Yeah, I would say that one and red coins are the two really easy ones.
[467:04.62]If you want to push it further,
[467:06.16]maybe one of the volcano stars.
[467:08.50]But there isn't that many options.
[467:10.66]Kony fan, thank you for the $100.
[467:13.04]Robbie, thank you for the $100.
[467:14.44]Kony the Go.
[467:15.18]Dude, Kony community actually coming in hot.
[467:18.02]I need them now more than ever.
[467:19.52]You do need them now more than ever.
[467:21.10]Please save me.
[467:22.90]More than ever.
[467:25.23]Mips again?
[467:26.07]Thank you for the 100 chatting DCF.
[467:27.71]I made this game.
[467:28.67]Simp jackass.
[467:30.33]Thank you for the 50 shiggy.
[467:31.69]I didn't know there were two Mips.
[467:35.29]Oh, you tried to lift it with one hand?
[467:38.44]Yeah.
[467:39.04]Oh, thank you.
[467:39.86]Yeah, Mips respawns at 50 stars, right?
[467:41.92]Pick this thing up.
[467:43.26]Oh, yeah.
[467:43.70]Oh, Jerma's going to go for it.
[467:45.72]Jerma, this is quite heavy.
[467:46.94]Jerma's going for the tungsten cube challenge where you lift it up with a single hand.
[467:50.98]That's a perfect angle, too.
[467:54.02]Ow, ow, ow.
[467:55.11]That was crazy.
[467:55.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[467:57.97]Oh my god.
[467:59.37]You can't see it, but he was actually lifting with one hand.
[468:02.29]You were off camera.
[468:03.69]Oh, he did it.
[468:05.31]So light and so easy.
[468:12.29]Yeah, I'm good.
[468:13.33]I'm good.
[468:14.53]Maybe over there.
[468:15.04]Thomas walked off the platform.
[468:21.19]This really hurts to wear.
[468:22.86]You can unzip.
[468:23.54]You can loosen up.
[468:24.58]Honestly, the arms.
[468:25.14]Sorry, the arms are too tight.
[468:27.20]I have to do star, right?
[468:38.33]You have to do MIPS again.
[468:41.36]I mean, you just catch your ass again, no?
[468:43.32]Yeah.
[468:43.54]Yeah.
[468:44.74]What's that?
[468:45.40]Volcano.
[468:46.36]Wait, wait, there's more, though.
[468:47.83]The elevator one.
[468:48.61]Oh, you're right.
[468:48.97]We don't do a lot of these.
[468:49.75]But why would we do MIPS?
[468:50.85]Don't we do more?
[468:51.73]This is the last one.
[468:52.37]Because it's 100 coin plus the other one.
[468:54.59]I'm going to grab a beverage.
[468:55.50]I'm going to break myself.
[468:56.54]Don't you need to do the two inside the volcano?
[468:58.14]This is the last one.
[468:59.60]We already did one of them.
[469:01.16]And then the two bullies?
[469:03.54]They're all done, yeah.
[469:04.28]You guys did all that?
[469:05.32]Yeah.
[469:05.96]Where the fuck was I?
[469:06.64]OK.
[469:07.06]Guys, chill.
[469:10.51]I know how to jump to stop fire.
[469:12.93]Look at this.
[469:17.37]It's crazy because Kony's never seen this.
[469:19.91]He's never been here.
[469:20.89]It shows how much slower he is.
[469:23.87]It's crazy that you have cheated in this way.
[469:26.06]He didn't know this part of the game exists.
[469:28.84]Don't get burned.
[469:30.24]Two more jumps left.
[469:31.68]Yeah, the camera's kind of ass here.
[469:32.88]Nice.
[469:33.58]Get the camera, bro.
[469:37.44]No, it's LittleBigPlanet.
[469:38.74]I fucking hate LittleBigPlanet.
[469:40.65]Thank you, Jacob, for the 100.
[469:42.03]Shout out to the tech team behind the cameras.
[469:43.87]Thank you.
[469:44.55]Thank you for the 100 count subula hype.
[469:47.39]It's not happening.
[469:48.17]Wait, wait.
[469:48.96]It's coming.
[469:49.64]It's coming.
[469:50.12]We are very close.
[469:51.28]Thank you.
[469:52.04]We're over $23 away.
[469:53.22]Oh, you don't have free will, dude.
[469:56.34]I don't know.
[469:59.45]costume for that.
[470:00.51]Dr. Battle, thank you for the 10.
[470:01.77]He said, excited to have the Mod Squad do a four-player run at next year's Fast 50.
[470:04.93]I don't know Koopa alone.
[470:05.93]You could do 100.
[470:06.89]I do casually, but not... I'm doing Piranhas.
[470:08.44]I don't know any off the top of my head.
[470:21.15]Probably piranhas.
[470:21.83]Yeah, I just didn't do 100 because I don't know where the piranhas are.
[470:25.23]Hi, Twitch frogs.
[470:25.87]Hello, Twitch.
[470:26.41]Literally.
[470:27.21]They have lovely piranhas.
[470:28.39]Alright.
[470:29.55]Piranhas.
[470:30.19]Y'all biting our shit over there, huh?
[470:31.21]Keep your eyes on your own paper.
[470:33.53]You know what I mean?
[470:34.27]How much do you get Tevin in a costume?
[470:35.69]I think Tevin would just be down to put on a costume.
[470:38.95]Nah, nah, nah.
[470:39.65]He's expensive.
[470:40.43]Oh, can't afford him.
[470:41.59]Can't afford him.
[470:42.09]Can't buy him.
[470:45.99]They can do secrets.
[470:47.23]Okay.
[470:49.25]Anonymous, thank you for the 250.
[470:51.62]Alright, Kony, after your next star.
[470:53.48]Is it over here?
[470:54.10]Oh, God.
[470:54.42]Or whenever you have time, you have to go get an outfit on.
[470:56.12]Sprint.
[470:56.66]No, shit.
[470:57.44]Yes, at the same time.
[470:58.20]Yeah, it's... You can do any order.
[471:00.30]Oh, I thought what you're going to do is you have to get the pipe.
[471:02.99]Whoa.
[471:03.29]I don't think I've ever seen that.
[471:05.49]It's big pipe, so I just go right?
[471:07.65]Like straight ahead.
[471:08.45]That's what I mean, yeah.
[471:09.51]Right over there.
[471:10.53]Okay.
[471:12.05]Oh, what?
[471:12.39]I already got them all?
[471:13.39]I did not get that last guy.
[471:14.41]Yeah, wait, what?
[471:15.15]What?
[471:15.85]That was weird.
[471:16.55]Hey, check the PC, bro.
[471:18.65]That was actually weird.
[471:19.69]230K!
[471:20.31]Alright, Kony, after your piranha, I mean, if you guys... It's you.
[471:29.12]We're doing piranhas.
[471:29.92]Yeah, do piranha first, of course.
[471:32.16]Y'all cue something up for me real quick.
[471:34.92]It takes me a while to get dressed.
[471:37.02]I think there's costumes on a rack.
[471:38.92]Alright, I'll just pick one.
[471:41.36]I don't know.
[471:42.04]There's one that's... There's a lot on a rack.
[471:44.18]That sounded kind of nice.
[471:47.80]Oh, my God.
[471:48.26]Can I just... Yeah.
[471:49.59]Okay.
[471:50.11]Did I get the coin?
[471:51.93]Yes.
[471:52.49]All that matters is you don't fall off this green thing.
[471:55.11]You can use slide kicks.
[471:55.93]They're pretty good.
[471:56.59]They'll spawn around.
[471:57.75]Oh, I see.
[472:00.80]There's one.
[472:02.34]I tried jumping.
[472:04.24]That does so much health.
[472:06.18]That hurts.
[472:07.56]You can jump on them too.
[472:08.76]They spawn when you're closer.
[472:09.80]That's why they're not coming up.
[472:10.95]Yeah.
[472:11.47]Nice.
[472:12.01]There's like three more.
[472:13.11]Two more, two more, two more.
[472:15.95]Yeah, that one and that one.
[472:17.57]Yes.
[472:18.47]This is so good.
[472:20.45]It's so scary.
[472:21.23]Nice.
[472:23.15]It's all the way over there.
[472:24.33]What if I fell though?
[472:26.07]That'd be very embarrassing.
[472:28.35]Okay.
[472:28.75]Alright.
[472:29.07]Costume change.
[472:30.99]Go, Coney, go, Coney, go.
[472:32.27]We have a Coney Cam.
[472:33.17]Oh, my God.
[472:33.79]He's cooking.
[472:34.67]Ripping through the halls.
[472:35.85]Oh, the camera chasing him like a horror movie.
[472:38.66]It's like a scary movie.
[472:42.32]He ignores that rack.
[472:43.26]He ignores that rack.
[472:44.20]Okay.
[472:44.52]Oh, he's going for the... He goes for the first thing he sees.
[472:48.16]Astronaut?
[472:49.10]It looks like King John from... Miss Frizzle?
[472:51.46]Robin Hood.
[472:52.00]Miss Frizzle.
[472:57.03]You think that's Miss Frizzle?
[472:58.67]I couldn't tell.
[473:00.31]It's a magical tunic.
[473:02.11]That's King John if I've ever seen it.
[473:03.37]He's moving really fast.
[473:05.69]The king.
[473:06.37]I'm so scared.
[473:07.43]Me too.
[473:08.15]Me too.
[473:09.15]Oh my god.
[473:10.97]What am I supposed to do for my star?
[473:13.31]What would he do?
[473:13.85]He has Wiggler.
[473:14.75]Do you know how to do Wiggler?
[473:16.00]You jump on his fucking big ass nose.
[473:17.46]Do you know how to get in?
[473:18.38]You jump on the thing at the top and go through the hole.
[473:22.00]You have to get little and go to the top.
[473:23.68]I don't know how to do the punch thing.
[473:25.28]Do you do the punch thing?
[473:26.16]You can just walk up the wall, right?
[473:27.06]You should do Cooperate.
[473:27.98]No, I shouldn't do Cooperate.
[473:29.84]Here he comes.
[473:31.00]Oh!
[473:33.73]Yeah.
[473:34.59]So fast.
[473:34.95]We didn't even get a Biahu?
[473:36.67]Oh, I didn't know it was that fast.
[473:38.15]You were so fast.
[473:38.53]Did I have this on right?
[473:46.63]How do you go here?
[473:47.43]Oh, jeez.
[473:47.85]You're going to do Wiggler and just do it the way you know.
[473:50.13]Like you ground pound the small island or whatever.
[473:53.39]Okay.
[473:54.77]Okay.
[473:55.23]You ground pound the top and small and it drains the water.
[473:59.71]I grabbed the first thing off the rack.
[474:01.69]You challenged the cameraman, honestly.
[474:04.77]Did you sprint with me?
[474:05.75]My bad.
[474:06.17]He did.
[474:06.69]At a certain point, it looked like he was going to hunt you down.
[474:10.62]You look good.
[474:11.12]It's like Blair Witch.
[474:11.98]Thank you.
[474:12.50]Thanks.
[474:13.48]Maybe you and I could lead a kingdom someday.
[474:15.22]We do look like we could lead a kingdom.
[474:17.56]We could lead quite the heteronormative kingdom.
[474:20.30]Maybe a mushroom kingdom?
[474:24.44]You might want to go Koopa.
[474:26.63]What the hell did that mean?
[474:27.35]Am I supposed to be here?
[474:28.25]What am I doing?
[474:28.83]Yeah, yeah, Koopa.
[474:29.91]Oh, Koopa.
[474:30.33]I thought you... I'm not even going to tell you what I heard.
[474:32.63]I'm sure I'm getting that started.
[474:35.59]Bye.
[474:36.86]Thank you for the 100, King Kony.
[474:39.46]That's one, too.
[474:40.42]Bow down to King Kony.
[474:41.74]King Kony, what do you decree for donations?
[474:44.50]I hereby decree a train of $20!
[474:47.90]$20 train, so it will be... The king is firm but fair.
[474:57.29]I mean, you're the queen.
[474:58.07]Of course you'd say that.
[474:59.43]Do that, but on the other side of the mountain.
[475:01.13]How the fuck do I get on the other side?
[475:02.47]You could have done that.
[475:04.11]Or that, yeah.
[475:06.73]Beautiful.
[475:07.15]I got a big eye on this.
[475:08.41]I don't know if I've ever seen someone do this.
[475:09.84]Dude, that's so smart, actually.
[475:11.16]Oh, there's Toad?
[475:12.14]There's another Toad?
[475:12.98]Hell yeah.
[475:13.42]Alright, you go.
[475:14.60]Toad break.
[475:15.10]You're in, right?
[475:15.58]Oh, that's smart.
[475:16.34]You got to leave to get the Toad here.
[475:17.54]Is it even funnier?
[475:18.30]We did that with a solo company.
[475:19.68]Yeah, yeah.
[475:20.48]Straight out this door.
[475:21.35]What?
[475:21.49]No!
[475:24.96]Right here to the left of him.
[475:28.12]That's beautiful.
[475:29.98]That's so smart.
[475:31.80]Well, we'll save that toe for later.
[475:33.26]I mean, this strategy could bring him back.
[475:34.44]Yeah.
[475:34.76]This is the first time we've seen someone gone away from the stage to do this.
[475:37.66]Outside of the run.
[475:38.24]Yeah.
[475:38.74]Nice.
[475:40.32]That genie is very powerful.
[475:43.43]We needed that so bad.
[475:44.47]He would have been on Koopa forever.
[475:46.13]No offense.
[475:47.69]Great thing to say.
[475:48.87]It's just cooked over there.
[475:49.77]Wait, shouldn't I have gotten the fucking box?
[475:52.43]No, I already did that.
[475:53.37]Why'd you do that?
[475:54.23]Bro's lost?
[475:54.85]I don't know.
[475:56.31]You did the box?
[475:58.00]Because I thought the star was easy.
[475:59.86]It is!
[476:00.60]Okay, where's bro?
[476:06.42]Bro?
[476:07.36]Leave that dude alone, bro.
[476:09.42]He has a flower on his head.
[476:10.44]Did I hit him?
[476:12.10]Each time you hit him.
[476:16.15]Give me your big-ass schnoz.
[476:19.50]Give me that worm.
[476:20.48]Ooh, this $20 train has been started for the king.
[476:23.30]Oh, my God.
[476:25.12]Yeah, they're coming through.
[476:26.67]A royal tithe to all my subjects.
[476:30.01]What the fuck's a tithe?
[476:31.29]A tithe is a tax.
[476:31.85]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it is, it is.
[476:34.03]I played Civilization.
[476:35.29]Ah, there you go.
[476:36.42]Okay, okay, okay.
[476:38.52]You did the box.
[476:40.46]That sounds hard.
[476:43.20]Compared to Wiggler?
[476:44.00]Yeah, Wiggler should be easier.
[476:46.76]Only 19,000 more dollars.
[476:48.32]If you're at home, if you've got a couple dollars to spare, now is the time.
[476:51.93]We are getting towards the end of the run, and I think we're going to get it.
[476:55.35]Shake Drizzle with a 20.
[476:57.65]Wait, actual Shake Drizzle?
[476:58.61]I don't know.
[477:01.78]Okay.
[477:01.88]I'll deal with you later.
[477:02.66]Back up.
[477:03.12]Shake Drizzle with the 20 when it shakes and drizzles.
[477:05.32]I respect that.
[477:06.64]You're giving me a left one, obviously.
[477:08.46]Waterfall.
[477:09.00]Here's an interesting play, though.
[477:10.28]They saved Toad and are choosing to save it for this stage.
[477:14.46]So could it be meta to save the Toads for the absolute last hardest stages?
[477:19.84]Yeah, for like on Rainbow Ride and stuff.
[477:21.82]Yeah.
[477:22.12]Yeah.
[477:23.66]Because TMI is still a difficult stage, but it's not close to, you know, a rainbow ride.
[477:29.33]Or even this one, for example.
[477:31.05]Little Big Planet's hard.
[477:32.91]No, dude.
[477:36.30]It's getting so hard, man.
[477:37.42]These levels, they're getting to that point.
[477:41.38]These runners out here are just laughing at them.
[477:46.79]That's so real.
[477:47.85]We left you a toad.
[477:49.03]I can do a toad.
[477:50.07]I can do left side.
[477:51.23]I can also do the monkey.
[477:55.16]The monkey.
[477:56.14]Alright, where do I go?
[477:56.96]The other one.
[477:57.78]God, you look so cool.
[477:58.70]Thanks, man.
[477:59.48]Wait, what?
[478:00.12]You got cooler from one start to the next?
[478:02.00]Dude, it's so red.
[478:02.88]I can't see it.
[478:03.32]I have an extra coin, right?
[478:04.20]Alright, where am I going?
[478:04.98]Go back in.
[478:05.74]Yes.
[478:06.33]You're just going to go left and then jump off the ledge.
[478:10.58]That's scary.
[478:11.22]There's a breeze.
[478:11.86]How do you have a shirt?
[478:12.94]Keep going.
[478:14.02]Go all the way to the edge where the 1-up is and go past the 1-up.
[478:16.88]Okay, past the 1-up, and then I just jump?
[478:18.60]Yeah, jump past the 1-up.
[478:19.84]Jump with conviction.
[478:21.03]And I pull back to the right.
[478:22.61]You have to miss another coin.
[478:24.07]That's so scary.
[478:24.99]So now over to the right by this Chukya.
[478:26.97]No down.
[478:28.36]Down.
[478:45.63]I've never seen that.
[478:46.73]What?
[478:46.87]Wait, what happened?
[478:47.99]He fell to the floor.
[478:49.02]He clicked through.
[478:49.64]What was that?
[478:51.78]Oh, my God.
[478:52.52]Huh?
[478:52.72]Huh?
[478:53.38]We tricked you, Ferry.
[478:54.20]You tricked good one.
[478:55.18]Good one.
[478:55.58]Very powerful spell.
[478:57.00]You inflicted upon the king.
[478:58.78]The space in, uh... King Kony does not take kindly to this insolence.
[479:02.73]Seeing that with the divine King Kony in chat hurts.
[479:05.73]I will see you hung for this.
[479:08.71]Uh, this, okay.
[479:09.67]You got it.
[479:10.03]That guy's so scary!
[479:11.13]It won't happen again.
[479:11.73]You're good, you're good.
[479:12.39]Ignore him.
[479:13.19]He smells.
[479:14.17]Nice.
[479:14.72]Alright.
[479:15.76]Very nice.
[479:16.24]Well done.
[479:17.06]That was crazy.
[479:18.10]I can't believe that happened.
[479:18.94]That's the only way to die.
[479:21.44]Yeah.
[479:21.78]Yes.
[479:22.26]I don't even know what else he's going to do.
[479:24.92]Yeah.
[479:25.14]What else is on the map?
[479:26.11]There's like a monkey.
[479:30.43]There is a monkey.
[479:31.21]He might have to do monkey.
[479:32.51]There's a toad, which you can do.
[479:33.99]You want to do the 100 coin?
[479:35.67]No, it's got to be box.
[479:36.93]Try without the toad.
[479:38.22]Oh, yeah.
[479:38.94]You're going to do the breeze and the top.
[479:43.71]Pull the video up now.
[479:44.41]Save the toad right here.
[479:45.93]No!
[479:47.03]Oh, my God.
[479:47.93]I'm trolling.
[479:48.49]Did he put his mic up to talk about the Lincoln Strat?
[479:50.46]I'm saying Bree's top is probably better than... He literally went, I hate it.
[479:54.16]He got really quiet over there.
[479:55.96]What's going on, guys?
[479:58.32]Some secret strats.
[479:59.94]Oh, God.
[480:00.64]Oh, no.
[480:01.50]Okay, real shit?
[480:02.20]That was unlucky.
[480:03.02]Hey, you've got to jump with conviction.
[480:05.06]You've got to have a pure heart.
[480:06.26]I'm thinking we save the toad for TikTok.
[480:10.37]Oh.
[480:10.73]He reveals the strats.
[480:11.27]Yeah, that could save like a death.
[480:13.63]Save the toad for TikTok.
[480:15.29]I guess, like, come back down.
[480:16.81]Why would it... So he doesn't have to do, like... Because I can do top of the mountain easier.
[480:20.08]I think cheese cannot comprehend that someone has a hard time on TikTok.
[480:27.81]He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[480:29.47]So he would do less tippy shit.
[480:30.87]Yeah, it's your turn.
[480:33.61]I mean, it's down to the point where you know exactly which stars you're trying to align around.
[480:37.71]Because basically, I feel like I can do top of the mountain better than I can do anything in TikTok.
[480:43.40]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[480:46.66]I can do top or monkey.
[480:48.66]Do monkey.
[480:48.90]The problem is, you can't do monkey unless you do top of the mountain first.
[480:52.76]So do top of the mountain, I'll do monkey.
[480:54.62]My team is trash!
[480:55.30]My team is trash!
[480:58.63]Or do reds.
[480:59.63]I like this, though, because there's still one more toad left in the rung.
[481:02.23]Oh, you do reds.
[481:03.17]Two, three stars.
[481:04.78]Because you go one more toad at the very top.
[481:09.20]Which is technically one stage.
[481:11.32]Seven stars.
[481:12.58]That's like a statement piece.
[481:13.94]No, I want less toad.
[481:15.38]I really like visit.
[481:16.38]Toad's very friendly and nice to me.
[481:23.12]I think they get to dick around a troll.
[481:25.06]I don't have that luxury.
[481:26.69]I got to try really hard.
[481:27.99]Alright, monkey time?
[481:29.55]Monkey.
[481:30.53]It's a hard start.
[481:31.17]Monkey's really hard.
[481:32.41]Monkey is low-key kind of hard.
[481:36.11]Ludwig can do monkey.
[481:36.97]Yeah, you want me to.
[481:45.14]Imagine.
[481:45.72]Beautiful.
[481:46.88]Almost.
[481:48.82]How do you fucking swim out?
[481:49.58]Can I try it again?
[481:50.22]Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
[481:51.10]I actually can't do it unless I die and we join.
[481:55.24]You could kill yourself and do... Sorry, pause?
[481:58.02]What?
[481:58.76]And you can do... Never mind.
[482:04.51]Alright, I'm not cutie over here.
[482:06.43]I know you say that shit to her.
[482:09.27]It's not this monkey.
[482:10.79]I'm trying to get on the fucking Lakitu.
[482:13.30]Okay, you mean the shy guy?
[482:14.26]Yeah, yeah.
[482:15.10]You can just run on the log.
[482:16.70]Just go on the log.
[482:17.20]Alright, alright, alright.
[482:18.30]Alright.
[482:21.80]Plunge him?
[482:23.24]Yeah, obviously.
[482:26.34]Okay, I got a brawl.
[482:27.40]You hold left the whole time, and then you hold right the whole time.
[482:31.57]That's all it is.
[482:32.31]It's left and right.
[482:34.13]What about the camera?
[482:35.63]I'll make sure you have the right one.
[482:36.47]You don't want to do a Fiat one where he holds up the entire time?
[482:39.82]There's one that's that.
[482:41.52]Bro, if I don't make this, though... I feel like we could do the eyeball.
[482:44.98]I thought he goes to the corner.
[482:46.20]Here we go.
[482:47.20]He goes opposite wherever you are going.
[482:50.69]What?
[482:51.13]Oh, that's a sneaky monkey.
[482:52.37]Try to run into him and he'll jump behind you and then grab him when he lands.
[482:57.07]Like that, yeah.
[482:58.39]And then get behind it.
[482:59.13]Now turn the camera right.
[483:00.19]There you go.
[483:00.55]Nice.
[483:00.79]Absolutely beautiful.
[483:01.97]And then one more.
[483:03.63]Now tap down.
[483:04.63]He goes down, right?
[483:05.35]Now go back to that other camera.
[483:06.32]Left, left.
[483:06.88]He's chilling.
[483:07.60]Just follow him.
[483:08.60]Just wait at the edge.
[483:12.52]Right here, right?
[483:13.04]Come here, Mr. Monkey.
[483:14.00]This is a hard star you guys are making Coney do.
[483:15.90]I can go down, right?
[483:18.18]And he gets it!
[483:19.86]The goat!
[483:20.24]Very good.
[483:20.78]That's actually nuts.
[483:22.06]That was actually... King?
[483:22.94]That was actually fucking dope.
[483:27.78]Thank you, princess.
[483:29.96]First try?
[483:30.40]First try?
[483:30.66]Queen?
[483:40.30]Queen, I'm sorry, queen.
[483:41.84]Trash boat, thank you for the 100.
[483:43.82]Anonymous, thank you for the 100.
[483:44.90]$10 mode, thank you for the $10.
[483:48.14]Trying to keep the $10 mode going.
[483:49.98]Princess, I would have said that.
[483:51.12]Five?
[483:51.40]I didn't know they liked our hierarchy.
[483:53.38]My bad.
[483:54.17]We had a 20 earlier.
[483:55.23]Yeah, it was a $20 train.
[483:56.81]It went quite strong.
[483:57.81]Just one more.
[483:58.53]Gotcha.
[483:59.43]Give me flame flames.
[484:02.19]I'm going to go over here.
[484:03.99]Don't take blocks from me.
[484:05.23]I got you.
[484:05.87]Alright, back up blocks, fine.
[484:06.83]Not as...
[484:08.68]It's crazy you're taking box from me.
[484:10.18]I'm sorry.
[484:10.87]This is two times.
[484:11.89]That is crazy.
[484:15.39]Okay, I can do in the icicle mountain.
[484:18.81]What on Earth?
[484:19.19]The igloo?
[484:20.07]The igloo, yeah.
[484:22.07]Okay.
[484:22.51]Wait, what happened?
[484:23.91]He's taken.
[484:25.09]I'm doing the one-sided route.
[484:25.90]I can do bully as well.
[484:27.42]Oh, yeah, true.
[484:28.06]We probably could have had Coney do this one, actually.
[484:30.44]The monkey?
[484:30.96]Now that I've seen the monkey walk across the screen.
[484:34.30]Low-key, the monkey's hard, Coney.
[484:35.40]I wouldn't tell you.
[484:36.26]I'm glad I didn't.
[484:37.08]It's very scary.
[484:39.88]Here we go!
[484:41.36]Oh, we are sixth!
[484:44.81]Yeah, but one behind.
[484:46.31]Igloo.
[484:48.53]Box.
[484:54.35]Wait.
[484:55.01]Oh, we didn't toad.
[484:55.99]I was like, wait, we're missing a star.
[484:57.10]I know there's like a triple jump.
[485:00.14]Yeah, you see what he's doing right now?
[485:01.42]Yeah, I see it.
[485:03.12]Do that.
[485:07.78]So it's just a triple jump into the seven.
[485:09.36]It's not easy.
[485:10.56]It's just a triple jump.
[485:12.47]Shit!
[485:13.63]It's not easy at all, even a little bit.
[485:16.03]I love this.
[485:16.65]I'll be the judge of that.
[485:17.87]It's like my favorite level of the whole game.
[485:23.25]Oh, no.
[485:23.43]Okay.
[485:23.81]Almost the wrong hole.
[485:24.69]Was it me?
[485:25.21]That's what she said.
[485:29.96]This guy over here.
[485:32.31]$400 donations on my screen saying $100 mode?
[485:34.10]No.
[485:34.32]That's crazy.
[485:34.96]A $100 mode is crazy.
[485:35.96]I mean, I see four of them.
[485:47.74]$100?
[485:48.84]What is a $100 mode besides 10 $10 modes?
[485:51.61]Amen.
[485:54.51]Either do $100 mode or call your friends and family and get them to sign up for $10 mode.
[486:00.11]And then get their friends and family to sign up for $10 mode.
[486:02.82]I think I got that one in the actual run.
[486:06.46]Has anyone thought about doing pyramid schemes for charity?
[486:10.54]Oh, I can't think out loud.
[486:11.70]Sorry.
[486:20.98]I hear that sound.
[486:24.90]I need that for my text alert.
[486:26.38]I don't like that.
[486:29.16]Are you all in 100 as well?
[486:30.50]Yeah.
[486:31.28]So it's basically tied.
[486:32.30]We're on the same star.
[486:33.18]You guys didn't get a toad or what?
[486:34.81]No, no.
[486:35.07]We're still holding on to her.
[486:36.33]Interesting.
[486:37.39]Keeping her hostage.
[486:38.29]Very interesting.
[486:39.35]Crazy thing to say.
[486:39.93]They're using the bank of toad on this run.
[486:44.17]$250 donation from Ava.
[486:46.11]Lost my job, but there's always room to give.
[486:48.38]Wow.
[486:48.96]Crazy.
[486:49.84]It is appreciated.
[486:50.76]I did not have to do that.
[486:51.76]Yeah.
[486:52.36]Thank you.
[486:53.56]$100 from $100 mode.
[486:54.18]$100 mode.
[486:54.68]Start it up.
[486:57.06]$10 from Qbert.
[486:57.72]Happy birthday, Stan.
[486:58.58]Sorry for the car.
[487:00.35]Let me fucking run this shit.
[487:02.53]What are you running?
[487:03.65]Oh.
[487:03.91]Wait, wait, wait.
[487:04.87]Mobile up, mobile up, mobile up.
[487:06.55]Camera.
[487:10.23]You need some chalk or something.
[487:11.90]It's so slippery.
[487:12.76]I do need chalk.
[487:17.72]This is the one-hand cubert challenge.
[487:19.15]This is 44 pounds.
[487:19.79]45.
[487:19.95]Okay, there's an honest-to-God $100 train happening.
[487:29.42]Ah, the last corner.
[487:30.48]Damn it.
[487:31.04]Dude, there's just something about seeing it that makes you think you can do it.
[487:33.24]That's the crazy thing.
[487:33.94]It looks so easy.
[487:34.81]I literally was just thinking, like, can I do that?
[487:36.47]Come on, baby.
[487:36.95]It looks so easy.
[487:38.07]I really underestimated it.
[487:39.35]It's a gluable, honey.
[487:40.81]Yes.
[487:42.07]I did it quickly.
[487:43.23]Wait, what are you supposed to do?
[487:45.07]You just pick it up with one hand.
[487:46.31]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[487:48.00]The corners are sharp.
[487:49.20]How heavy is it?
[487:49.76]Wait, how'd you dive it in?
[487:50.76]45 pounds.
[487:51.00]Yeah, we got to try this.
[487:51.86]Oh, my god.
[487:52.40]It's very hard.
[487:53.98]I could probably do a handstand holding myself up.
[487:55.76]This would go up.
[487:56.18]I'm doing Bully, yeah?
[487:57.10]$100 from David Cockerings and $100 from the Hundo Fair.
[487:59.50]It's a $100 trade.
[488:00.20]It's just happening.
[488:00.96]$100 are flying in for charity.
[488:01.98]We have already hit $234,000.
[488:02.96]What's it do?
[488:04.02]$234,000?
[488:04.04]You're good at Cloud.
[488:05.00]And so many $100 donations.
[488:05.74]Shirtless Simply at $235,000.
[488:06.31]I'm down.
[488:06.57]That's just what I'm hearing.
[488:24.43]Is that 2S on YouTube?
[488:25.16]Make it 240k.
[488:25.66]We got a deal.
[488:31.77]I'm with you.
[488:32.89]So many hundos.
[488:33.83]Yeah, it's crazy.
[488:34.69]The $100 train is working.
[488:35.65]Do you want to try the cube simply?
[488:37.47]Huh?
[488:38.07]Oh, yeah.
[488:39.05]We should probably turn around now.
[488:41.82]I'll get it on the next round.
[488:44.12]Wait, Ludwig, did you get it up?
[488:45.38]I did bully.
[488:46.18]Oh, no.
[488:46.52]Did I get the cube up?
[488:48.50]He said actually the answer is still no.
[488:51.72]No, I did not get it up.
[488:53.28]Oh!
[488:53.48]Wait, is he opening?
[488:53.98]No.
[488:59.27]That's crazy.
[489:00.31]Oh, that's so funny.
[489:01.71]Oh, that kills me.
[489:02.87]We call that the backdoor entrance.
[489:05.61]Oh, my God.
[489:06.15]Yeah.
[489:08.55]You'll own him.
[489:10.51]What?
[489:11.63]He's very strong.
[489:12.33]This is a formidable match.
[489:13.67]He's very strong.
[489:14.43]Just bump into him.
[489:15.62]Whoa!
[489:16.84]Not yet, not yet.
[489:17.86]It's Icy, it's Icy.
[489:18.58]Just don't pound, just jump.
[489:19.40]Wait, does that kill him?
[489:20.38]Yes, jump will hit.
[489:21.72]Wait, jumping?
[489:22.56]Just don't pound.
[489:23.20]Just stop pounding.
[489:23.98]Just jump, just jump at him.
[489:25.22]Okay.
[489:26.22]Take that!
[489:27.24]Eevee.
[489:27.62]It spawned right there, spawned right there.
[489:29.34]Had me stressing out over here.
[489:30.44]He's scary, man.
[489:31.46]He's very big and powerful.
[489:35.12]Will we have head?
[489:35.78]Yeah, we do.
[489:37.24]Okay.
[489:37.44]About to get head.
[489:37.88]Going upstairs both at 102, though.
[489:39.46]Yeah.
[489:44.67]It is so close.
[489:48.39]Not with my goat at the helm.
[489:49.68]It's going to be so hard.
[489:50.80]Team Liam!
[489:52.44]Wispy, think of the 100.
[489:53.06]Andrew B., think of the 100.
[489:54.24]Chuchu, all aboard.
[489:56.02]Think of the 100.
[489:58.28]Etzeru, this is a fully blown $100.
[490:00.58]This is a fully blown $100 train.
[490:03.45]That's insane.
[490:04.43]I've never seen it before.
[490:05.33]I didn't know it could be that big.
[490:06.69]This is going crazy.
[490:08.19]Sure.
[490:10.31]I just saw a 100 cent.
[490:10.89]Where is it?
[490:11.65]It's gone.
[490:14.74]Dude, 100-step mode still goes hard.
[490:16.23]Yeah, it does.
[490:16.95]You usually go to the left side like you did this for the 6 and 7 thread.
[490:21.81]Um, six, seven.
[490:23.29]Normally I do the turn around, you know?
[490:25.13]Right, right, right.
[490:25.83]But I didn't want to do it because I'm kind of scared.
[490:28.00]Alright, so you're doing TTM.
[490:28.96]They still have to go down for Toad, too.
[490:31.58]TTC?
[490:32.66]What's TTM?
[490:33.54]TTM is the monkey stage.
[490:34.92]Ash Toad is over there, right?
[490:36.18]I saw him in the corner.
[490:39.53]What do I do?
[490:39.83]100?
[490:39.85]Yeah, 100.
[490:40.25]I haven't done this in forever.
[490:41.21]Do you guys want me to do moving reds?
[490:43.13]Yes.
[490:43.67]Do you know anything in TTC?
[490:51.85]That's silence.
[490:55.39]Damn it, Coney.
[490:56.25]Also crazy, like, after obviously him not knowing anything in, like, snowman land, it's like, I got TTC.
[491:04.68]I got TTC.
[491:05.14]I'll do all of them.
[491:06.18]TTC's where I turn it up.
[491:09.20]Like, I vaguely, because I played this game casually ten times, but I don't remember it.
[491:13.16]Ten times.
[491:13.86]It's weird that he knows the number of times I've played it.
[491:16.58]How do you know?
[491:21.00]Qbert says, actually, I'm 41.62 pounds.
[491:23.70]Is that true?
[491:24.16]Uh, no.
[491:27.66]You could just get a tote.
[491:29.34]Do you want me to go tote?
[491:30.30]You could just get a tote.
[491:31.02]You're called, man.
[491:32.00]I mean, he can get a tote, but he still needs to get the star.
[491:34.74]The question is, when do you go for the tote, right?
[491:37.13]There's got to be something.
[491:39.13]I'm going to YOLO.
[491:39.95]I just don't know, man.
[491:41.31]YOLO that golf ball.
[491:43.25]You could do red coins at TPP.
[491:45.42]I know that's the one with the platforms, right?
[491:47.76]That one's easy.
[491:48.44]It's just I can't do it as fast.
[491:49.58]Should I go for red coins right now?
[491:51.74]You don't have to get them when the clock's at 12.
[491:53.26]Are you comfortable with that?
[491:54.66]Yeah, I'll just stop it.
[491:55.82]You can kind of do whatever here.
[491:56.82]So I get in at 12, and then all the things are dead, and then I just get on the way.
[492:00.41]Is that good enough?
[492:01.89]I don't think so.
[492:03.85]I think it's perfect.
[492:06.07]500 people spamming for shirtless simply and one guy saying, can you all calm down?
[492:11.65]You guys need to chill.
[492:13.37]Hey, guys, this is a twist shift.
[492:17.42]Oh, no.
[492:18.40]Son of a... I don't think I've ever seen a ledge grab there.
[492:21.86]Oh, now what happened?
[492:23.46]I didn't go in at 12.
[492:24.00]Oh.
[492:24.10]Alright, it's over here, right?
[492:27.26]Yes.
[492:27.58]Okay.
[492:28.82]You just do a bunch of jumps and kicks.
[492:31.22]Okay.
[492:31.79]You love those.
[492:33.53]I'm not a fight coach.
[492:34.75]I love jumping and kicking.
[492:39.41]Is there one down there?
[492:42.29]Yeah, those are unfriendly.
[492:43.87]I'm having so much fun.
[492:46.31]Okay.
[492:47.51]Nice.
[492:48.59]Interesting routing.
[492:49.39]I like this.
[492:49.77]Thank you.
[492:50.29]I mean, simply just watching happen.
[492:51.87]Whee!
[492:51.97]Okay, well.
[492:52.33]Wait, where does it go?
[492:55.73]Amazing.
[492:56.11]Nice.
[492:56.21]Nice.
[492:56.31]I got it.
[492:56.81]I got it.
[492:57.51]I got it.
[492:57.77]No, no, no.
[492:57.97]Gentle.
[492:59.01]Chill.
[493:06.03]That was hot.
[493:06.57]Gentle.
[493:07.79]That was hot.
[493:10.28]What's the other one we could do in TTC?
[493:13.52]Coney and I could do...
[493:17.13]What do you like?
[493:17.59]There's that one at the top where the clock hand goes into the hole.
[493:21.63]You can do the one where you go around.
[493:23.69]You go all the way up the red thing, and then there's just one through a little hole.
[493:27.16]Let's do that one.
[493:28.82]The hole lines up with the clock hands, right?
[493:32.30]That one's a bit hard.
[493:32.96]I jumped when it was turning.
[493:34.04]Yeah, it did the weird, like, you can't do shit things.
[493:38.05]Oh, he's charged up.
[493:41.89]Wait, Twitch chat is for Simply and YouTube chat is for Kony.
[493:44.87]At this point, they're both on that team.
[493:46.87]Okay.
[493:49.03]It's just so many divine emperor Kony's.
[493:51.38]Really?
[493:51.64]Five moves of heavenly virtue.
[493:53.26]Five stars of heavenly virtue.
[493:54.32]Are you seeing what I'm seeing in Twitch chat?
[493:55.46]This is saying five moves.
[493:56.44]It's saying shirtless Liam, shirtless Simply, shirtless Jerma, shirtless Qbert.
[494:04.52]First one in!
[494:05.28]First one in!
[494:06.04]Wait, you said the seven virtues, right?
[494:08.39]Ah, yeah.
[494:08.71]Temperance, chastity, right?
[494:10.87]I gotta be careful.
[494:11.87]You gotta be careful.
[494:13.95]Nowhere.
[494:15.21]Mac and Mail taking the dollar.
[494:16.19]$100!
[494:16.21]My bad, my bad, my bad.
[494:17.62]That was good.
[494:18.16]That's so bad.
[494:18.82]$100!
[494:18.92]$100!
[494:18.96]We got $100! $100!
[494:25.03]50,000 donated $1.
[494:26.47]$237,000.
[494:26.49]Oh, there it is.
[494:29.61]We are so close.
[494:30.65]We're 13,000 away from our goal.
[494:32.67]Who's costume changing at 240k?
[494:33.73]Anyone can costume change?
[494:36.19]I think we got Shirtless Simply.
[494:37.65]Yeah, I can take my shirt off.
[494:38.81]Alright, and then Tevin gets a costume change?
[494:40.39]Yep.
[494:41.09]Be happy to.
[494:41.53]Just in the background, just has a different costume.
[494:46.31]We're getting close, man.
[494:47.77]107.
[494:48.23]That's very close.
[494:48.77]And we are almost at 50 hours.
[494:50.25]Wait, are we three minutes away from 50 hours?
[494:52.17]Yeah.
[494:53.35]Okay, we're going to go past 50 hours.
[494:54.39]And we are going to end the stream at exactly no matter what's on screen.
[494:58.23]Fast, fast 50.
[494:59.29]We're going to end the run.
[495:00.07]You guys have to go home.
[495:01.49]Sorry.
[495:02.25]So you're going to do basically what he's doing.
[495:04.13]Fast 51.
[495:04.51]You're not going to do that.
[495:06.27]You're going to go left there instead.
[495:07.83]Yeah, because we're star short.
[495:09.01]Do you know what you're doing?
[495:13.49]I'm going up the fucking mountain, bro.
[495:18.97]True, though.
[495:19.65]The pendulum star.
[495:21.17]Sheesh.
[495:21.69]Alright.
[495:22.22]Nice.
[495:22.70]Let me just freak my shit.
[495:23.82]Do I wait for 12, too?
[495:25.36]Wait for 12?
[495:25.76]Mm-hmm.
[495:26.48]Okay.
[495:28.14]Have I ever led you guys astray?
[495:29.74]No.
[495:29.86]I got to try the cube.
[495:30.56]Never.
[495:31.56]Never.
[495:31.78]I'll give it a go after you.
[495:34.08]It's remarkably heavy.
[495:35.45]Alright, Sibyl.
[495:36.83]You got to guide me, brother.
[495:37.97]Okay.
[495:39.71]Give it a shot.
[495:40.21]There's one up here, right?
[495:41.89]Do I have to go up top?
[495:43.77]Yeah.
[495:44.35]It's like wall kick on here.
[495:47.01]It's slippery, too.
[495:49.04]Almost restored.
[495:51.14]You have to really hurt your fingers.
[495:52.70]Yeah.
[495:54.20]Just keep going up and following this path.
[495:56.86]I'm just so scared of falling.
[495:58.88]I understand your fear.
[495:59.82]I feel like if I had a slide, one of those owl gloves, I'd be able to do it.
[496:03.72]For a falconer?
[496:04.36]Yeah.
[496:04.88]If I had a falcon glove, I could probably try it.
[496:06.62]That's worse.
[496:07.06]That's worse.
[496:07.46]And then...
[496:09.76]Now, from here, you can turn the camera.
[496:11.30]If you get... You're cheesing?
[496:13.96]Oh, I see it, I see it.
[496:16.37]Nice.
[496:16.53]Hot.
[496:16.69]Okay.
[496:24.16]I'm too scared for the wrist, but I feel like maybe bending it kind of like an up angle?
[496:28.08]If you turn it a little bit.
[496:30.41]Yeah, turn it this way laterally.
[496:32.59]Exactly.
[496:33.07]Is that cheating?
[496:33.87]What's crazy is I think both teams need all the brain power in the world to figure out which stars these chuckle fucks are going to do, and they're just trying to lift the cube.
[496:42.37]What?
[496:46.65]Oh my god, do I go here?
[496:48.23]Yeah, you long jump there.
[496:49.13]Is this get a hand?
[496:49.94]Yeah, you long jump from there.
[496:51.82]Just like straight left.
[496:53.58]Oh god, have mercy on myself.
[496:55.36]Oh no.
[496:59.44]Ten stars remain.
[497:01.60]Alright, alright.
[497:02.30]Oh boy.
[497:02.58]Oh, turn around.
[497:03.58]Face that way.
[497:05.02]I leave Toad out here too.
[497:05.94]Just in case.
[497:06.40]Just in case we get on camera.
[497:09.04]You almost had it.
[497:10.32]The chosen one.
[497:12.15]King Arthur Excalibur.
[497:13.67]Shit.
[497:13.85]Oh wait, I'm stressed.
[497:18.25]I'm so scared.
[497:19.31]That's so unlucky.
[497:20.61]Great try.
[497:21.31]Otherwise it falls.
[497:22.15]It's like the risk.
[497:22.97]It's like when a car falls on someone and a baby lifts it.
[497:25.19]Yep.
[497:25.68]Or it just goes right through.
[497:26.94]You're just going to use two hands.
[497:28.64]No.
[497:31.30]Dude, I know I can do this.
[497:32.34]That's the crazy thing.
[497:33.20]That's the crazy thing about me is I know I can do this.
[497:34.98]It's like the new pickle jar, right?
[497:36.56]It's like, no, no, no, get out of the way.
[497:45.05]You know who first tries that shit?
[497:47.17]Reba McIntyre.
[497:50.21]It's carpetless time.
[497:51.37]That's so shitty, dude.
[498:01.61]Bro, what?
[498:02.23]50 hours!
[498:08.35]Thank you all for watching, everyone.
[498:09.71]We'll see you all next year.
[498:13.68]Are you guys going for Karbulus?
[498:14.54]And to celebrate, S1mple's gonna hit this first try!
[498:16.93]Okay, okay, wait, this is actually important.
[498:18.49]Fast 50!
[498:19.89]This will save so much time.
[498:20.79]I'll be faster up.
[498:34.48]Yeah, dude, it's hard to see the text.
[498:36.10]Fuck!
[498:36.28]I don't know if I can do it on the... It's hard to see the pixels.
[498:41.32]How many tries do you guys call it?
[498:42.94]Three?
[498:43.18]Three?
[498:45.18]We have 36 lives.
[498:46.30]Well, gentlemen, three.
[498:48.30]Wait, we have way more lives than you.
[498:49.72]What happened?
[498:51.40]I was fucking about.
[498:52.22]Yeah, not that many.
[498:54.50]Wait, what?
[498:54.84]Alright, alright, hold up, hold up.
[498:56.79]Oh, my man, she's cooked.
[499:06.75]I don't know your setup, actually.
[499:09.17]Oh!
[499:09.65]Oh!
[499:09.87]Oh!
[499:10.31]Oh!
[499:10.69]Oh!
[499:16.99]Oh my god.
[499:17.59]That's crazy.
[499:19.15]I didn't know what that was the right thing.
[499:20.57]I was like, I don't know.
[499:22.11]Alright, I'll go for it one more time.
[499:23.89]I didn't know.
[499:24.93]I wasn't sure if it was too late or... That's actually crazy you got that.
[499:30.80]Yeah, that was me.
[499:31.48]I did that.
[499:31.94]That was me.
[499:32.38]I did that over there.
[499:33.12]Where's that little fucker?
[499:38.02]I took the scenic route.
[499:38.78]I like the castle.
[499:40.48]Leave him alone!
[499:42.88]Hey!
[499:43.00]What's up, punk?
[499:46.26]Todd Rogers.
[499:49.91]Scooby-Doo-Doo-Dee-Dee-Dee.
[499:51.47]Scooby-Doo.
[499:52.53]Okay.
[499:55.25]Alright.
[499:56.97]Take two.
[499:59.50]There's a delay, man.
[500:05.10]Yeah.
[500:24.77]No, that was it!
[500:25.87]I missed the A for us!
[500:26.81]You missed the last A for us?
[500:28.87]Oh, shit.
[500:31.49]I'm going for it one more time.
[500:32.41]Okay.
[500:33.87]It's so much time lost at this point.
[500:36.71]Look, I'll make it even.
[500:37.75]Cheese, you go for the Toad.
[500:39.51]I go for the Toad.
[500:41.55]Yeah, you got to get the next Toad.
[500:43.73]So you have to do a hard start then.
[500:45.23]Yeah.
[500:45.63]Which every start is hard here.
[500:46.82]Yeah.
[500:47.20]I can do Triangles.
[500:50.86]Triangles?
[501:00.66]Is it this?
[501:01.00]Yeah, it's this one.
[501:02.52]Pro doesn't know how to do the Toad.
[501:04.36]I was like, did you get the upstairs one or 51?
[501:10.02]You're playing now.
[501:19.96]It's getting tense in here.
[501:22.04]Yeah.
[501:23.00]I only hear breathing.
[501:24.68]Yeah, no one wants to see that part.
[501:26.24]It ain't happening.
[501:28.21]Rip.
[501:29.03]Always doing the thing.
[501:29.77]The last chance was the one.
[501:32.52]Alright, I'll just go assless.
[501:35.38]He almost did the thing.
[501:38.66]What are we saving for Coney?
[501:40.81]Uh-oh.
[501:43.05]I don't know.
[501:43.89]I don't know.
[501:44.27]Is it there?
[501:44.69]I mean, you can ride the rainbow, right?
[501:47.27]I mean, like, because you guys can do the other stars faster.
[501:49.67]How do you get across?
[501:51.00]Like, if we're going to triple jump on that?
[501:53.16]You mean up there?
[501:54.16]No, the other side.
[501:54.80]You mean the ride?
[501:55.70]Ideally.
[501:56.04]You know what I'm saying?
[501:57.04]Well, you do it with 100 usually.
[501:58.82]Yeah, they fall.
[501:59.38]You got to go.
[502:00.02]Okay, okay.
[502:01.26]Dude, he's crazy.
[502:03.18]He's just knocking them all down.
[502:04.38]They respawn, don't they?
[502:05.94]Maybe in like a minute.
[502:06.96]Tricky triangles or roads.
[502:09.86]Okay, folks.
[502:10.62]Holy... This is fine.
[502:12.76]I'm just cooking.
[502:14.88]Folks, we're forgetting about... Oh, he's going up here.
[502:16.78]Alright.
[502:18.20]You'll do what Ludwig's doing?
[502:19.91]No.
[502:20.45]I'll try.
[502:20.99]Where is bro going?
[502:24.09]Yeah, this is good.
[502:28.65]So if you ground pound when you hit the star coney, it skips an animation.
[502:33.58]We should have told you that hella ago.
[502:34.68]Yeah.
[502:41.14]Very interesting camera.
[502:42.94]I can do triangles.
[502:43.80]You can do triangles?
[502:46.16]Yeah, I just have to do right side.
[502:47.22]I can't do left for the long jump.
[502:51.18]That's a safe camera.
[502:53.00]You can't move camera.
[502:54.88]Okay, you're going to... I think you just turn right and long jump straight.
[502:58.28]Turn left and long jump.
[502:59.06]Yeah, you just long jump towards that pole.
[503:01.63]What the... I can't walk.
[503:03.91]Where do I go?
[503:06.01]That way, I guess.
[503:09.36]This one?
[503:10.92]One more.
[503:11.64]Keep turning.
[503:12.24]Blood looks like me.
[503:13.42]You don't have to land on the pole.
[503:15.39]Go down, though.
[503:17.11]Oh, I go down?
[503:17.91]Yeah, yeah.
[503:18.93]Wee!
[503:20.33]I think Leo might be Team Simply over here.
[503:24.23]No, the other way.
[503:24.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[503:26.91]Okay.
[503:28.96]Yeah, I just have lots of fun.
[503:31.36]Play the level I got in 10.
[503:33.28]Give it a little ride.
[503:35.02]That RNG.
[503:35.96]I know.
[503:36.32]Are you feeling immersed?
[503:39.98]I love this.
[503:41.02]It's like I'm really Super Mario.
[503:45.84]You got this.
[503:46.44]You're good.
[503:47.78]Watch out for the ice.
[503:51.00]Okay.
[503:51.68]Oh, I didn't even see that.
[503:53.65]Nice.
[503:54.37]Your body just knew.
[503:55.71]You had the instincts.
[503:56.83]Instinct.
[503:58.94]Wee!
[504:00.22]Doing this casual without turning the camera is blowing my mind.
[504:02.70]More fire coming out.
[504:03.36]I know he's never seen this.
[504:04.20]You're good, you're good.
[504:05.68]That's fine.
[504:06.30]Nice.
[504:08.38]The Ludwig thing, if you ground pound under it, he'll reach the ground.
[504:10.93]He didn't say that.
[504:12.37]He didn't say that.
[504:16.41]I don't remember that.
[504:19.35]So what are we, like 30 seconds apart?
[504:20.85]What do you think, Linkus?
[504:22.97]More?
[504:23.41]No, like a minute, minute and a half.
[504:24.67]Because we got... They still have to get...
[504:28.86]Y'all got carpetless.
[504:29.86]They have to ride the carpet.
[504:32.22]Oh, you still have the Toad Star.
[504:34.53]No, no, we use it.
[504:35.21]Both of them?
[504:35.89]Yeah, she's got one.
[504:37.49]But they have to get carpetless, so that's the difference.
[504:39.35]And we just got 100.
[504:39.93]Yeah, then probably like two minutes or so, two and a half.
[504:43.63]Two minutes!
[504:45.61]Sorry, team, I tried.
[504:47.87]It's okay.
[504:48.73]We really wanted the bottleneck to not be us.
[504:51.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah, as long as it's you.
[504:53.48]If you're the reason we lost, I'm happy.
[504:54.92]Did you say you're going for it again?
[504:58.61]No.
[504:58.97]Oh.
[504:59.97]Misheard.
[505:00.53]I knew Carpalus would be the... What is left?
[505:04.09]Triangles.
[505:05.55]And the Swing and the Breeze.
[505:07.15]Oh, wait.
[505:07.93]The one on the Pirate Ship, right?
[505:09.27]Oh, Jesus.
[505:09.53]Oh, right.
[505:10.22]Oh, yeah, Assless.
[505:11.32]Oh, Jesus.
[505:11.82]Shit.
[505:12.72]What's Assless?
[505:13.98]That's like the trick.
[505:15.12]Lakitu.
[505:16.10]Lakitu Bounce.
[505:16.92]It's like a new age.
[505:17.76]They call it Assless?
[505:18.92]Because it's like an updated version.
[505:19.98]Well, I'm not doing it because... Oh, my God.
[505:25.12]What do you get?
[505:27.21]What extra coin now?
[505:27.91]I'm going to let you focus.
[505:29.41]If I lose these blue coins, I'll... I don't know.
[505:41.06]I was the first one to do assless, but now I don't do it.
[505:45.32]I just can't do it anymore.
[505:46.60]I don't know why.
[505:47.22]I don't know how to do assless.
[505:53.45]Skibidi.
[505:56.15]I guess I'll just go up here?
[506:03.82]Shit, no no no.
[506:09.70]Son of a what?
[506:10.76]That was weird.
[506:11.46]You can do it from there like it's fine.
[506:13.61]That's so ugly.
[506:15.87]What is this?
[506:16.23]This is my Build-A-Bear route.
[506:17.35]I'm just making up right now.
[506:18.27]Fucker.
[506:19.39]How do I get uppies now?
[506:20.59]It has a lot of heart.
[506:22.03]Oh, there we go.
[506:23.21]See, so I'm just showcasing off the alternative route that you might see in 120 Star.
[506:28.01]Just to give you the full scope, right?
[506:29.43]This is the power of the Nintendo 64.
[506:31.33]Oh, God.
[506:35.74]That's crazy.
[506:36.64]If he hit that shy guy and saved it, I would have... I don't know what I would have done.
[506:42.84]Very scenic, yeah.
[506:44.96]How are you fulfilling now?
[506:47.75]Oh, I'm great.
[506:48.65]I'm fine now.
[506:49.39]Yeah.
[506:49.53]Don't worry about me.
[506:51.95]You gotta worry about this guy.
[506:53.52]Yeah, true.
[506:54.06]I'm asking the wrong guy.
[506:54.98]I'm not ready to ask him yet.
[506:57.50]I'm rattled.
[507:03.66]Oh, he knows the double dome kick.
[507:05.33]Good.
[507:05.51]It's not bad.
[507:06.91]It's not much in it.
[507:07.59]Nice.
[507:08.03]Clean.
[507:11.71]They're at 119!
[507:12.27]And then we swap.
[507:14.96]I'll do the first throw, you do second.
[507:17.06]Where did our stars go?
[507:18.34]Alright, maybe Bowser will kill them.
[507:28.48]I've never gone up those stairs forwards.
[507:30.98]That blew my mind.
[507:32.18]Mario would be covered in bruises, wouldn't he?
[507:35.37]Oh, yeah.
[507:35.87]Liam never messes up.
[507:36.75]Oh, he'd be brutal.
[507:39.84]I don't know your stomach that many times.
[507:41.96]Yeah.
[507:43.58]Maybe they'll fall like ten times.
[507:46.19]Look, $1,000 donation, Liam will fall, and I'll do the Bowser in the dark.
[507:51.29]Or the Bowser in the sky?
[507:52.33]Yes.
[507:52.41]If you get a $1,000 donation, we'll SD, and I'll do Bowser in the sky.
[507:57.74]Let me call my bank.
[507:59.22]Let me call my bank.
[508:01.34]Let me clear a check.
[508:04.33]We got a $760 donation.
[508:06.55]Ooh.
[508:07.50]You want to do it?
[508:08.06]I think it was irrelevant.
[508:10.04]It was from the shirts.
[508:10.86]We sold more shirts, as we talked about earlier.
[508:13.22]If you want something to commemorate this event, if you want $5 of that to then go to charity, buy a shirt.
[508:18.05]They look cool.
[508:22.09]Damn, that was clean.
[508:23.57]That was new shit.
[508:25.03]240, 238, 4.
[508:25.39]Is that old shit?
[508:26.65]What's left in here?
[508:27.93]Kind of, but most people just don't do that.
[508:29.62]Red coins?
[508:30.60]Yeah.
[508:31.46]That's the faster ones.
[508:32.12]I had to do reds.
[508:33.38]Oh, the reds are in here.
[508:34.44]That's not that bad.
[508:35.36]Just make your way around the maze.
[508:36.40]We got a bit of time.
[508:37.56]That's scary.
[508:40.26]Alright, that $1,000 donation needs to come in now.
[508:44.06]Otherwise, wait, hold, 120.
[508:49.53]Yeah, fuck it, let me run it, let me run it.
[508:50.99]End it, end it!
[508:51.95]Fuck it, let me run it.
[508:55.91]We can't lose now.
[508:57.41]Damn, he did it for free.
[508:58.49]For the love of the game.
[509:00.63]He's playing in the park.
[509:01.45]No nets, double rims.
[509:03.55]He just loves this shit.
[509:05.35]He's just hooping.
[509:05.93]It's raining and he's hooping.
[509:07.69]Bang.
[509:08.17]So I just go to the maze.
[509:09.15]I don't know how to get there fast.
[509:11.01]You go long jump to that pole.
[509:12.71]Son of a bitch.
[509:14.75]Just gotta push this guy.
[509:17.52]I've never seen this box get pushed in my entire life.
[509:20.63]So it actually is a movable object.
[509:22.33]He's teaching us science, it's over.
[509:26.69]We go up the pole.
[509:31.82]Wee!
[509:33.48]Wait, what?
[509:35.56]Oh, I didn't know that.
[509:38.56]I thought I just died.
[509:41.04]You got this.
[509:42.43]Okay, so what's the best?
[509:45.09]I should have gone up, right?
[509:47.35]You'll figure it out.
[509:48.13]Damn.
[509:48.69]Come on.
[509:49.03]The coach gave up.
[509:50.23]Alright, you're
[509:54.84]Now we're just casually running it?
[509:56.62]It's part of the fun, man.
[509:57.72]It's a maze.
[509:58.48]Stay within the confines of the maze.
[510:00.76]Okay, thank you.
[510:01.97]Okay, that's great.
[510:03.45]Keep your hands inside of the maze at all times.
[510:06.35]Wait, how do I get?
[510:07.31]You can jump off the blue wall.
[510:08.27]Oh, right, yeah.
[510:10.48]Right, I go off this way.
[510:13.49]Right.
[510:14.19]There we go.
[510:14.69]Two reds.
[510:15.43]Two reds.
[510:16.45]Ludwig's at four.
[510:18.85]Yeah.
[510:20.89]Okay.
[510:21.70]That's okay.
[510:22.16]You can jump down from above.
[510:24.58]Oh, Lord have mercy.
[510:25.96]Oh, my God.
[510:27.10]That doesn't kill.
[510:27.94]Can I go that way?
[510:30.12]You can, you can.
[510:31.76]You got this.
[510:32.50]Wait, I didn't know it was right there.
[510:33.82]I don't know where the red coins are.
[510:35.90]There's one right below you, too.
[510:38.18]Excellent.
[510:38.82]Nice.
[510:39.62]Just go up.
[510:40.28]Go back up.
[510:40.88]To the left, to the left, to the left.
[510:42.20]Yeah, I don't know what I'm thinking.
[510:43.97]Why is Stance helping?
[510:45.49]I mean, I want to see a close race.
[510:46.67]I'm also going to ask Lud to kill himself again.
[510:51.54]Okay, so this is the third time today.
[510:56.18]Oh, no, it's downstairs.
[510:58.46]Oh, it's down?
[510:59.50]No, but get that one, and then, yeah, you're going to go down and then left.
[511:03.53]Oh, I see.
[511:05.11]Nice.
[511:05.35]Ta-da!
[511:07.65]I, like, never saw them collect a queen or something.
[511:10.03]They're going into sky.
[511:12.71]Uh-oh.
[511:13.07]No, get down!
[511:14.03]Whoa!
[511:14.45]Whoa!
[511:17.00]Alright.
[511:17.88]Don't kill Bowser.
[511:19.28]Because Simply's the one also doing reds.
[511:21.42]Yeah, that'll be huge.
[511:22.42]Yeah.
[511:23.24]I mean, it could theoretically come down to throws.
[511:26.00]Yeah.
[511:26.32]You got to move.
[511:27.33]I've seen some bad throws in my time.
[511:28.87]I've thrown some bad throws in my time.
[511:30.73]I've thrown some bad throws.
[511:32.29]Nice.
[511:36.82]So we're switching on every bomb hit, yeah?
[511:38.58]Yeah, yeah.
[511:39.26]Oh, cool.
[511:41.70]So he gets red, so you get first throw, I get second throw, he gets last throw.
[511:44.32]Yeah.
[511:44.76]Where's that last red at?
[511:46.42]It's at the end.
[511:47.46]You're good.
[511:47.78]You get second throw.
[511:48.74]Oh, my God.
[511:49.86]It's under the stairs.
[511:52.08]Wait, does that mean Lud gets to do this level and get final throw?
[511:54.64]Yeah, whoever does the level gets third throw.
[511:57.22]Wow.
[511:59.78]Don't fall here.
[512:00.30]That was actually really weird.
[512:03.00]Why do you think it's possible for me to fall here?
[512:04.68]Okay.
[512:09.54]Yeah!
[512:10.56]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[512:12.46]Me?
[512:13.46]Yeah, yeah, you're first.
[512:14.18]No, because you were doing it.
[512:15.32]Oh, yeah.
[512:16.52]So I do first?
[512:17.82]Oh, you.
[512:18.42]I do first, second, third.
[512:19.95]Okay.
[512:20.35]Sure, sure, sure.
[512:20.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[512:23.13]So I'm doing second.
[512:23.81]I'm doing second.
[512:24.33]Oh, are you sure?
[512:25.23]Yeah, because we skipped.
[512:26.33]Jeez.
[512:26.57]Oh, okay.
[512:29.87]That was a great throw.
[512:31.36]Bro, looking like me out there.
[512:32.94]Dude, tap it in.
[512:35.40]Oh, I said tap it in.
[512:37.62]There we go.
[512:38.40]Oh, yeah.
[512:39.89]Good to go.
[512:41.19]I agree with that.
[512:43.45]Whoa.
[512:43.63]Whoa.
[512:44.05]What is little bro doing?
[512:46.51]Might as well get to the close.
[512:47.91]No, that one's fine.
[512:50.53]We're playing golf over there, bro.
[512:52.13]What's going on over there?
[512:53.59]I'll swag out.
[512:55.92]Alright, we got 120.
[512:56.44]This is impossible to miss.
[512:57.66]Nice.
[512:59.40]I love that this is impossible to miss.
[513:01.67]That could have broken his confidence.
[513:04.77]Game on the line.
[513:05.65]You're too far on the one to the left, I think.
[513:07.29]I'm about to break your jersey for you.
[513:09.49]That's clutch.
[513:14.70]That's ice in the veins.
[513:17.92]Still Liam?
[513:19.04]What a close ending.
[513:20.16]You got to clutch.
[513:20.82]That's you, that's you, that's you.
[513:22.36]No.
[513:25.56]I didn't know we would have to pass off.
[513:26.70]Team Leo!
[513:28.50]Let's go!
[513:29.66]GG, fellas.
[513:31.00]You got this.
[513:35.36]I know it's over anyway.
[513:36.47]I'm just practicing.
[513:37.31]I'm submitting that to speedrun.com.
[513:40.09]I think that might have beaten my 120 PB.
[513:42.49]Yeah, it's pretty decent, honestly.
[513:44.77]That's not bad.
[513:52.03]Yes, sir.
[513:53.41]Nice.
[513:55.17]I gave you the long jump.
[513:58.75]I gave you the long jump.
[513:59.83]It's so funny.
[514:02.60]Like he's been teeing it up for him all day.
[514:05.82]Just don't buck this up for us.
[514:06.96]I gave it to you.
[514:08.50]I'm sorry, Kony.
[514:09.82]You blew it.
[514:10.98]Oh, God.
[514:12.36]Oh, no.
[514:16.44]Oh, man.
[514:17.70]You get it on this one.
[514:23.85]CRT, dude.
[514:24.59]The timing's too crisp.
[514:25.67]That's why I messed up everything else.
[514:28.59]It's too good.
[514:30.85]Okay.
[514:31.25]There we go.
[514:31.61]Nice.
[514:33.99]Let's go.

[515:57.31]No.
[515:58.37]That's what I thought.
[515:59.35]I thought you guys were talking about it.
[516:00.81]Sorry, I just thought his name.
[516:01.61]I freaked out.
[516:02.63]Liam?
[516:04.57]Just thanks for putting it on.
[516:05.31]It was a lot of fun.
[516:09.05]That's it.
[516:11.66]Wise words.
[516:12.48]Well, Shibbrother, please check out all these runners and all these creators.
[516:18.66]Because not all runners.
[516:20.64]Not all runners.
[516:21.64]Not all runners.
[516:23.44]But no, I really appreciate you all being here.
[516:25.49]Mario is like the first game that I really started watching for speedrunning.
[516:27.89]So glad we're able to have like a cool little segment for it at the end here.
[516:31.49]But we're not done yet.
[516:33.15]I believe it is time.
[516:34.37]Oh, yeah, shit.
[516:35.71]Yo, I got one of these for each of you.
[516:37.09]Oh, my God.
[516:38.01]Yeah, you can take this home.
[516:38.91]Yeah, they got those, man.
[516:40.19]Yeah, you can take this shit home.
[516:41.21]We don't get those because of you.
[516:42.95]Yeah, this is your little throw this in a damn trophy cabinet.
[516:46.49]I mean, if you stole one, I wouldn't find out, you know?
[516:50.49]Anyway, we're not done yet.
[516:51.87]We're almost there, chat.
[516:53.47]The goal is a quarter mil.
[516:55.42]We're a little over 10k away.
[516:57.72]And our final segment of the day is going to be another crab's treasure.
[517:01.86]A look at the speedrun.
[517:03.06]Is that right?
[517:05.00]The world record.
[517:05.82]Whoever won the challenge.
[517:06.88]The world record for the moist critical bounty.
[517:09.04]Another crab's treasure.
[517:09.88]No uppies.
[517:10.86]Are we cutting right to that?
[517:11.68]Are we going to a break?
[517:12.56]That's a great question.
[517:14.22]You got a teleprompter?
[517:14.86]And I will find out from you.
[517:16.20]I have one.
[517:16.62]It says nothing.
[517:17.26]It says, you know what?
[517:17.91]Do your own thing.
[517:18.57]Let your freak flag fly.
[517:19.61]That's fair enough.
[517:20.45]Let your freak flag fly.
[517:21.57]That's what it says.
[517:22.01]I'm here.
[517:22.59]I'm a cow.
[517:23.95]I'm next to a chicken.
[517:25.07]I'm having a good time at Fast 50.
[517:26.99]And a gas station magician.
[517:28.47]And a gas station magician.
[517:29.55]Gas station magician.
[517:30.79]Forget that.
[517:31.03]Gas station magician.
[517:33.20]Alright, start two.
[517:35.12]Straight to it.
[517:35.68]Well, I'm stopping then.
[517:36.40]I'm stopping.
[517:37.02]Yeah.
[517:37.66]Get on up here.
[517:38.38]We need your wisdom.
[517:39.50]It's a beautiful song for the end.
[517:53.61]Hello, chat.
[517:54.17]Hello.
[517:54.43]I've switched chairs now.
[517:57.47]Oh, man.
[517:58.01]This is such an uncomfortable outfit.
[518:00.69]Rich Grinch.
[518:04.01]You've got to go do a weather report.
[518:05.43]Yeah, you've got to do a weather report.
[518:06.78]We've got to see you.
[518:08.88]Oh, you want me to do the weather?
[518:09.84]Yeah, let's try it out.
[518:12.92]Just to see you out there.
[518:13.66]That's going to be scary.
[518:16.14]And a big thank you to our talent throughout this entire weekend.
[518:21.42]Can we just... I'm here, I'm here.
[518:22.95]I'm ready to do this.
[518:23.75]This is what I was born to do.
[518:24.67]Jerma influenced me.
[518:26.19]Well, okay.
[518:26.63]Thank you to Tevin for that weather report.
[518:29.62]Clearly trained by Jerma himself.
[518:47.14]Thank you.
