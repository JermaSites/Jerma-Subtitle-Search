[00:11.77]I want to be in the video.
[00:13.31]I want to be in the video.
[00:15.01]What?
[00:15.81]I want to be in the video.
[00:17.15]What do you mean?
[00:17.63]What are you talking about?
[00:19.79]Please let me be in the video, Jerma.
[00:22.69]Get out of the way.
[00:24.19]I'm trying to snipe.
[00:27.18]Oh, what the hell, Star?
[00:28.80]Ruining my meta.
[00:31.44]I want to be in the video.
[00:32.76]I want to be in the video.
[00:35.95]Oh no, you screwed me all up.
[00:40.07]No, you have to go pyro.
[00:41.37]I have to go pyro?
[00:42.65]Pyro with the flog and the detonator.
[00:45.11]What?
[00:46.02]Pyro with the flog?
[00:47.38]I don't even have the flog.
[00:48.78]I'll go Rainblower.
[00:49.96]Okay.
[00:51.06]No, don't go Rainblower.
[00:52.44]Yeah, I'm going Rainblower.
[00:57.02]Wait, let me get a hat that isn't disgusting.
[01:05.43]Oh, I need to recharge my mana.
[01:07.41]Alright.
[01:08.47]What are we doing?
[01:08.93]I can't play like this.
[01:10.65]I think I know how to detonate.
[01:14.74]We need to wait until they push the cart up.
[01:16.18]Then we start to become champions.
[01:18.24]But right now, we just need to... Whoa, you just lagged out.
[01:21.76]I'm still here.
[01:23.95]What are we supposed to do?
[01:24.65]Oh, there's a heavy up there.
[01:26.75]Heavy up there.
[01:27.21]Oh, I got the dumbass ham.
[01:32.50]Oh, backstabbed.
[01:37.08]What are we doing?
[01:38.56]We're going up here.
[01:39.80]We're going up there?
[01:43.79]I did it.
[01:47.93]And by I did it, I mean I can't do it.
[01:51.57]You gotta do it.
[01:52.73]It's just like a rocket jump.
[01:54.01]You don't have to right click.
[01:57.30]I'll get it.
[01:57.72]I'll get it.
[01:58.10]Don't worry.
[01:59.22]I'll get it.
[02:01.90]I'm not gonna get it.
[02:03.56]You gotta get it, Jerma.
[02:05.66]I'm so bad.
[02:06.50]I'm so bad.
[02:08.74]I'm so... I can't.
[02:11.38]Give me your keyboard for a second.
[02:12.76]Alright, take it.
[02:17.66]There's a mini sentry too, so I think we're doomed.
[02:20.25]Where is it?
[02:20.63]Dude, I legitimately can't even see with the Rainblower.
[02:28.71]Everything is like blending together.
[02:34.44]Alright, so what's the next super secret strategy?
[02:37.26]Oh, well, you need to get some health, bro.
[02:42.08]So we're going up here, right?
[02:44.32]I just respawned.
[02:46.52]Meet me at the Big Ben.
[02:49.18]Big Ben?
[02:49.88]Spy, spy.
[02:52.05]There's a scout going.
[02:52.89]Alright, what's Big Ben?
[02:53.75]Oh, that Big Ben.
[02:55.77]Okay, beam me by the cart.
[02:57.43]I'm at the cart right now.
[02:58.71]Okay, turn around.
[02:59.07]I'm right behind you.
[02:59.71]Let's go up here.
[03:01.83]You can do this one.
[03:02.67]Yep, I can do that one.
[03:05.32]Everybody's a pyro on this team.
[03:08.84]That's the meta.
[03:12.02]Every single person is a pyro.
[03:15.10]Did you die?
[03:16.06]No, I'm alive.
[03:19.76]Come back.
[03:20.90]I'm just rain blowing.
[03:23.04]I need health.
[03:25.12]Watch out!
[03:25.40]Let's go!
[03:27.84]Where's the damn health?
[03:32.22]Oh my god, I really need ammo.
[03:34.70]D'oh!
[03:39.09]Alright, brain blow is coming off.
[03:40.41]I can't like, I can't even breathe when this is on.
[03:45.95]The season of, uh, Highlander.
[03:49.19]Oh, the season, the season of Yggdrasil Highlander?
[03:51.51]Yeah.
[03:52.31]Yggdrasil.
[03:53.19]Oh, Oxy.
[03:55.14]I'm gonna sing you an Oxy Highlander song.
[03:58.00]Star is my favorite Highlander friend.
[04:02.20]Are you honored that you're in that song?
[04:03.76]I'm so honored.
[04:05.46]Yeah, I was thinking about one day playing Eyelander.
[04:08.54]That's how you have to say it.
[04:12.58]I'm not ready, actually.
[04:13.46]I was spending too much time being a weirdo.
[04:16.01]Probably gonna get headshot right here.
[04:18.71]I got the collateral.
[04:20.65]Oh, you did, huh?
[04:22.71]Didn't play the noise for you?
[04:23.75]Do you hear the noise?
[04:24.69]You gotta listen to the noise!
[04:26.36]Hey, I was too busy trying to not get shot in the face as an engineer, okay?
[04:30.04]Okay.
