[00:03.10]He didn't get scammed.
[00:04.06]I'm here.
[00:06.36]You didn't get scammed.
[00:07.24]Uh-oh.
[00:08.12]Uh-oh.
[00:11.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[00:12.13]Don't tell me I have to change servers again.
[00:13.81]Don't even do that.
[00:16.15]I just turned it on.
[00:17.09]Don't even tell me I have to change servers.
[00:22.17]Come on, man.
[00:25.94]We'll see.
[00:27.26]Ha ha ha.
[00:31.14]You know, every couple weeks I have to change my Twitch server.
[00:35.70]Because... I don't know.
[00:38.76]It doesn't like where my connection's coming from, apparently.
[00:41.85]But hello, how are you?
[00:42.63]Good to see you.
[00:44.69]What's up?
[00:45.07]I'm doing good.
[00:50.73]Talk about baseball?
[00:51.67]I just... Wait, we're gonna get to that.
[00:55.61]Let me wait to disappoint everybody.
[00:58.55]Give me a few minutes to come and sit down.
[01:02.60]Eating any olives today?
[01:06.56]Of course, I eat olives every day.
[01:10.99]Talk about your Roblox server.
[01:14.69]I don't have one of those.
[01:23.17]Make me a cake.
[01:25.01]That's the point.
[01:25.61]That's what we're going to try to do today.
[01:26.63]Okay.
[01:34.13]Don't leak.
[01:35.73]Don't leak.
[01:37.19]People are already leaking the bad news for baseball.
[01:39.87]Don't leak.
[01:46.38]Don't leak.
[01:50.22]Alright.
[01:51.76]No, it's not time yet.
[01:55.21]I had a wild six or seven days.
[02:01.23]Did the Beerio Kart thing with Ludwig.
[02:04.88]Which was a ton of fun.
[02:05.70]I didn't think I could drink that many beers.
[02:07.16]I really didn't.
[02:09.06]You guys didn't really get to see that much of the beer drinking, but holy shit.
[02:13.64]I've never drank beer faster in my whole life.
[02:22.18]We almost won, too.
[02:25.96]When we got to Rainbow Road, it's just like, I can't do Rainbow Road.
[02:30.46]I couldn't, I can't do Rainbow Road sober.
[02:33.18]I can't do Rainbow Road at all.
[02:35.96]I would skip that level.
[02:39.68]In fact, I would stop playing Mario Kart at that kind of, what is it, the Star Cup, whatever.
[02:45.48]No, I don't feel like it.
[02:46.26]I don't want to play that.
[02:49.32]I don't want to play that part of the game.
[02:57.31]But that was fun.
[02:59.59]Then this whole Mr. Beast versus Ninja tournament.
[03:04.37]That was crazy too.
[03:07.67]Got to hang out with a lot of people.
[03:11.90]It was a lot of fun.
[03:14.10]I wish more people would come to Vegas.
[03:17.40]It's so much fun when people come here.
[03:22.03]Rainbow Road is easy.
[03:25.13]What'd you say?
[03:27.74]I want to see what this person said.
[03:28.61]Rainbow Road is easy, you just need skills.
[03:33.99]No.
[03:35.35]It's not easy.
[03:42.61]You lost 10,000 at 10k at the casino.
[03:44.77]No, I did not.
[03:50.40]I did not lose 10k at the casino.
[03:55.27]Witch Rainbow Road?
[03:56.35]Aren't they all the same exact course from when it first showed up in Super Nintendo?
[04:02.19]It's the same one, right?
[04:06.68]Did they change it?
[04:07.34]Why would they change it?
[04:08.62]They don't even need to change it.
[04:12.06]It was 20k.
[04:12.40]Where are you getting this idea that I lost $20,000 at a casino?
[04:17.73]Who told you this?
[04:28.85]It was 30k.
[04:29.95]Well, the number keeps going up, so whatever.
[04:34.61]We know.
[04:38.13]No, it was awesome.
[04:38.79]It was really fun.
[04:42.86]Anytime a bunch of streamers come into Vegas and I ever have an opportunity, I'm just like, oh, come to Vegas.
[04:48.06]Alright.
[04:48.90]Alright.
[04:49.98]You'll be in Vegas?
[04:51.46]Really?
[04:51.74]What are you up to?
[04:53.48]Hey, what are you doing?
[04:55.44]What are you doing?
[04:59.65]It's always a lot of fun.
[05:07.04]You live in... Why do you live in Vegas?
[05:11.34]Because, that... You know what I mean?
[05:14.56]That's it.
[05:16.02]I don't... Okay, I'm gonna give... I'll do it slow this time.
[05:19.08]Why do you live in Vegas?
[05:20.80]Because, I mean... Come on.
[05:23.58]You know what I'm saying?
[05:25.28]You know what I mean?
[05:28.62]That's why.
[05:40.20]It's close to LA, but you don't have to pay LA prices.
[05:44.45]It's only 45 minutes in a plane to LA.
[05:48.77]The real estate market out here is way, way cheaper than some of these other places.
[05:56.06]There's no state tax in Nevada.
[05:59.74]Isn't that interesting?
[06:01.94]There's also lots of entertainment.
[06:04.94]There's so much stuff to do here.
[06:07.12]Do I have to do this whole thing every few months?
[06:12.50]Do I have to do this every few months?
[06:25.15]Do you have a react trick?
[06:28.74]Taxes?
[06:30.14]I didn't move here just because of the tax... the state taxes not being a thing.
[06:35.68]I mean, it was... I mean, you know, alright.
[06:40.73]But that's not why I'm here.
[06:46.17]Again, it's close to LA.
[06:50.03]I don't have to pay LA prices.
[06:54.27]45 minutes, wheels up, wheels down.
[06:58.14]The real estate market is at... I'm not doing this anymore.
[07:08.42]What happened to the mystery game?
[07:10.23]Every single stream is a mystery game.
[07:11.95]I figured out what I'm going to do 10 minutes before the stream turns on.
[07:16.20]Every day is a mystery.
[07:17.86]Besides the event streams.
[07:20.14]Like baseball.
[07:21.87]By the way.
[07:22.27]That's something to talk about with baseball.
[07:26.61]So.
[07:27.62]Okay, enough people are here.
[07:28.38]Let's do it.
[07:29.26]So baseball...
[07:31.80]Baseball is supposed to be on the 24th of July.
[07:34.50]I told you the last time I streamed, I kind of had, it was kind of a sad moment.
[07:39.72]I said, we're trying really hard to get stuff to work.
[07:43.34]We've had some venue problems.
[07:45.68]And I was given the opportunity to either do it in a different place that would kind of suck.
[07:53.07]That's not what I want.
[07:54.87]Or push it to August and do it where I want to do it and how I want to do it.
[08:00.35]so I said okay this do you delay another few weeks another month or so right and do what I actually want to do or keep the same date and do it in a different venue potentially in a scenario that I didn't want to do it in and of course I'm going to pick the one that I want to do so we're going to do it in August
[08:33.74]Thankfully, it does not have to be in October or November or something, so we're good.
[08:40.94]And also, here's another good thing about this.
[08:43.84]There's a couple things that I may have wanted to do that I didn't have enough time to prepare for it if it was in a week that now I can add into the show.
[08:54.72]So it's going to be a better show now overall because there's a couple things I get to put in it now that I may have had to cut for time.
[09:02.85]So.
[09:05.05]I hope I don't sound like a broken record here, but August 19th is the new date for the baseball show.
[09:12.98]Now, I'm going to tell you right now, I am 90% confident in that date.
[09:20.10]I don't think it's possible at this point for it to be not that date.
[09:24.70]If it's not that date, then I'm doing it in my backyard.
[09:28.71]You know what I mean?
[09:29.65]Like, I'll do it in a backyard, right?
[09:38.93]90%.
[09:40.89]This stream is going to happen before the summer ends, okay?
[09:45.82]That's what I can 100% guarantee to you.
[09:54.04]Delay, yeah, delay, delays, delays, delays, delays.
[09:57.08]I know.
[09:58.75]But here's the thing.
[10:01.01]If I don't delay the show, think about it.
[10:03.49]If the show were to be next week, and it's, I mean, look, it's going to be good.
[10:09.33]I am so excited to do this.
[10:11.89]I've been looking forward to this for like two years.
[10:13.35]It's going to be fun, regardless of where it is or how the things that I want go, right?
[10:19.95]But...
[10:21.33]Why not do the thing you wanted to do?
[10:24.02]The thing that you've been planning to do.
[10:25.54]The thing that I've had written down on a piece of paper.
[10:29.36]Well, that makes it sound like it's on the back of a fucking napkin.
[10:31.68]The thing that I have spent... Yeah, I wrote down two sentences.
[10:36.13]No, the thing that I've had sitting in various documents over the last few years of shit that I really want to do.
[10:44.11]And I'm going to do the thing I want to do.
[10:45.92]And that's all there is to it.
[10:50.40]2022 not 20 no not 2023 what are you talking about are Grotto Beasts nfts no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no stop stop asking no
[11:09.58]No, they're not!

[11:22.72]Clip any one of those.
[11:25.60]They're physical.
[11:35.13]We got two raids right at the beginning?
[11:40.08]Wait, Kit Boga just came in with a raid.
[11:42.06]What's up, Kit?
[11:43.48]Hope you had a good stream.
[11:45.57]Kit Boga.

[12:42.06]Fuck yeah.
[12:42.63]I feel like it's been a month since I streamed.
[12:46.03]It's only been a week.
[12:49.39]But why am I streaming at 11 o'clock in the morning tomorrow?
[12:55.97]There's a sponsor stream tomorrow.
[12:58.13]Ooh, okay.

[13:43.86]What's the cigarette thing?
[13:45.53]Is that the thing I'm missing somehow?
[13:49.35]Alright, let's go.
[13:50.71]Today we're gonna play Bakery Simulator.
[13:58.53]Bakery Simulator.
[14:02.61]This feels... Is this made by the same people that did Cooking Simulator?
[14:09.65]Is it by the same people?
[14:10.33]Are you going to do a raid song?
[14:12.24]Guys, it's not 2018.
[14:12.76]We don't do raid songs anymore.
[14:17.84]Is it by the same people?
[14:23.85]I think you can drive around.
[14:26.65]From the trailer, it looks like there's a car in this game.
[14:28.57]So it gets an automatic A. Starts at A. And let's go.
[14:33.45]You guys ready?
[14:35.88]Good.
[14:38.50]What's up?
[14:41.89]Why is it asking me if I want my Nintendo Switch?
[14:44.59]What?
[14:47.80]Okay.
[14:49.88]Hi.
[14:49.96]How you doing?
[14:54.78]I know.
[14:55.08]Your cam sucks.
[14:56.02]Your cam is blurry.
[15:02.53]Ralph?
[15:02.95]Oh, whatever.
[15:03.33]Alright, so should I do the tutorial?
[15:05.47]Do I know how to play this already?
[15:06.99]Okay.
[15:11.82]I'm just gonna do it.
[15:14.18]You're all orange.
[15:18.62]You look like an orange.
[15:19.82]I don't, I don't care.
[15:23.30]Everything is in PST.
[15:24.42]That's right.
[15:24.90]I'm in PST.
[15:27.30]I also figured out too, I don't know what it is about this camera, but I looked at the images from the last stream too.
[15:33.64]This makes my head go like this.
[15:37.33]It makes my forehead and head look way taller and bigger.
[15:40.55]I don't know why it's doing that.
[15:42.75]What lens does that?
[15:45.25]Do you see what I mean?
[15:46.85]I have this big forehead with this camera.
[15:50.97]I don't look like this.
[15:54.34]Oh, I was off the- what was the loading time?
[15:55.90]Alright.
[15:56.86]Welcome to your bakery.
[15:59.10]Your biggest dream came true.
[16:00.14]You opened your very own bakery and you're ready to flood the city with fresh pastries.
[16:03.56]However, it's just the beginning.
[16:06.50]A lot of hard work ahead of you.
[16:08.28]Build reputation, gain experience, and become successful in the world of baking.
[16:12.66]There's a lot of responsibilities, but don't... This guitar is kind of... I don't know, something about it.
[16:18.50]There's a lot of responsibilities, but don't worry, you'll make it.
[16:21.15]After all, this is all you've dreamed of.
[16:22.77]Your first order is waiting for you.
[16:26.45]This is just bad Ratatouille.
[16:27.85]You have not played it.
[16:30.05]You don't know that.
[16:32.96]Okay, WASD, that's got to change for sure.
[16:44.15]Is this a piano or is this a guitar?
[16:48.52]Is it?
[16:48.72]No, wait, this is the guitar setting on the piano.
[16:54.39]No, this input's too high.
[16:58.26]That's the lowest I can do.
[16:59.90]Please tell me it's alright.
[17:00.62]Alright, that's better.
[17:02.08]Alright, go to the ordering board and press left mouse on the folder.
[17:06.71]Alright, ordering board.
[17:07.65]Left mouse.
[17:08.13]Folder.
[17:08.45]There it is.
[17:09.11]Got it.
[17:11.15]Five Minute Bakery.
[17:12.73]Three Breakfast Bun.
[17:14.01]Is that the road?
[17:17.09]Okay, I don't know why I thought that was like Three Breakfast Bun Road.
[17:20.01]Because I saw this.
[17:22.76]Whoops.
[17:23.10]Okay.
[17:24.12]This is how you're going to start your work from now on.
[17:28.18]Okay.
[17:29.00]So, it takes five minutes.
[17:33.10]On the left is a list of shops with current orders.
[17:37.37]Now, only one order is available.
[17:38.85]Okay.
[17:40.19]But later in the game, you'll be able to pick more than one request from a much longer list.
[17:43.39]Alright.
[17:45.91]That's a map with marked shops.
[17:49.49]Based on it, you can check the location of orders.
[17:51.40]You can decide what part of the city you want to make a delivery to.
[17:53.64]Alright.
[17:53.92]So, yeah.
[17:54.40]You drive around in this game.
[17:56.74]Are you wearing a wig?
[18:00.14]You'll make it up if I say no anyways.
[18:02.80]Alright, pick the available order and press confirm.
[18:04.51]So this one here.
[18:08.77]After selecting an order, it will appear on the ordering board.
[18:10.63]Press to click on the board.
[18:11.87]Alright, so this is the order.
[18:14.55]Three breakfast buns.
[18:16.53]But before you move further, let me teach you about the recipe book.
[18:18.94]Okay.
[18:23.22]To open the... Okay, press tab.
[18:24.88]Tab.
[18:28.41]Is this by the House Flipper people?
[18:30.85]This menu looks very similar.
[18:32.43]Okay.
[18:36.67]So where's the recipe book?
[18:40.04]Wig.
[18:42.24]Select the recipe book now.
[18:45.26]Here are all the recipes that you already know.
[18:46.96]Right now, it's not that much, but don't worry.
[18:49.02]With every new level, you'll learn new ones.
[18:51.00]Bookmarks on the side make navigation easier.
[18:53.14]Where's my... There it is.
[18:56.02]That looks like a lot of information.
[19:00.12]That's a lot of info.
[19:00.98]That's a ton of steps.
[19:03.90]Okay, this is gonna... I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this.
[19:07.66]Each recipe page contains information about the steps required to prepare the order as well as ingredients, mixing time, ingredients, and baking time.
[19:17.52]You can stop tracking it.
[19:18.60]Oh, it's like a quest log.
[19:19.67]Alright.
[19:22.41]You should recreate this on stream.
[19:26.08]No, I don't like the smell of eggs.
[19:29.20]I like the way eggs taste.
[19:31.64]I don't like the smell of raw eggs.
[19:34.04]After you crack a raw egg, and if it just sits out there for more than one to two minutes, I hate that smell of raw egg that has not, like, gone away from me.
[19:44.81]There's no eggs in this?
[19:49.35]Do you guys know what I'm talking about, though?
[19:51.33]I don't like baking because it just... Flour and eggs... It has this weird off-putting kind of essence to it.
[19:59.95]I really don't like it.
[20:00.97]It's weird.
[20:03.97]You know what I... Some of you guys get it.
[20:06.37]You don't smell the eggs.
[20:07.35]No, you don't.
[20:08.15]I'm not smelling them.
[20:09.20]Alright.
[20:09.88]I'm trying to play.
[20:10.62]Okay, you can choose the number of products to bake by... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:14.94]Okay, use the arrows.
[20:16.50]The recipe will adjust accordingly.
[20:17.82]Oh, okay.
[20:20.22]Cool.
[20:23.04]Checklist is visible on the right.
[20:24.48]So this is how to make the breakfast buns.
[20:26.38]Follow the recipe and complete it perfectly.
[20:30.21]Cooking is not a science, man.
[20:32.55]Come on.
[20:33.87]Six ounces of wheat flour.
[20:35.51]I could do five.
[20:36.13]2.4 fluid ounces of water.
[20:38.97]You could do two.
[20:40.37]Milk.
[20:40.97]Just don't even put it in because milk is gross.
[20:43.92]Yeast.
[20:44.78]Extra yeast.
[20:45.40]I want one ounce of yeast.
[20:48.46]And then I want...
[20:51.79]By the way, don't do that.
[20:53.44]Milk and flour is incredibly important in all these recipes, so don't be an idiot.
[20:57.44]Alright, let's do some baking.
[21:00.82]Bowl.
[21:02.97]This bowl is average and small, but don't worry.
[21:06.15]During the game, you'll be able to unlock bigger and more professional bowls.
[21:09.61]Okay.
[21:09.73]Okay.
[21:17.31]That's what I do in the kitchen.
[21:19.17]I'm here for like... I'm like the comic relief.
[21:21.57]Alright, so now what?
[21:22.45]Oh.
[21:23.87]Time to collect the needed ingredients.
[21:24.87]Go to the ingredients rack.
[21:25.75]Let's go.
[21:26.17]So I need wheat flour.
[21:28.93]Something on fire.
[21:29.97]Oh.
[21:31.33]I don't like that.
[21:34.18]Is that what it... Is that what it is?
[21:35.18]I feel like that's dangerous.
[21:36.16]What if you walk by and you like get your... Your pant leg catches on fire?
[21:41.12]This is not controlled enough for me.
[21:43.10]Alright.
[21:44.62]Ingredients rack.
[21:45.24]Where is that?
[21:45.60]Over here?
[21:48.49]Okay.
[21:50.97]In the bottom left corner of the screen, you can find the scoops.
[21:56.56]What?
[21:57.86]For now, you just need a one gram scoop.
[22:01.84]Click the ingredients by clicking.
[22:03.00]Where's my scoop?
[22:05.26]Bottom left of the screen.
[22:06.22]You guys see any scoops?
[22:10.56]Okay.
[22:10.68]Okay.
[22:13.32]Every time you're using the scoop or pressing and holding left mouse, the spoon will refill itself one by one.
[22:18.69]Alright, so... How much do I need?
[22:21.51]This is butter.
[22:23.45]Pure, creamy butter.
[22:24.59]Is this even in the recipe?
[22:29.17]What do I need?
[22:33.16]Where are my scoops?
[22:34.78]Pick up the bowl.
[22:36.88]Oh.
[22:37.04]I put my hand in it.
[22:41.94]That looks to be about one cup.
[22:44.68]Let it go and a quarter of it is stuck to my sweaty hand.
[22:49.06]I just have to shake like this.
[22:51.88]Alright, so now we go water.
[22:56.00]No, wheat flour.
[22:57.09]Where's that?
[22:58.83]Where's the flour?
[22:59.43]Okay, wheat flour.
[23:05.19]Scoop.
[23:09.29]Scoop it out.
[23:12.89]There's no butter in this recipe.
[23:15.78]Do you see butter?
[23:19.38]What?
[23:22.38]There's no butter in this recipe.
[23:27.80]Okay.
[23:28.34]Oopsie, look at the checklist.
[23:29.38]It seems you've added the wrong ingredient.
[23:30.70]What will you do now?
[23:31.50]This is what I just was saying the whole time.
[23:32.78]What are you talking about?
[23:33.55]What do I do now?
[23:36.24]By the way, anytime you make a mistake, you will see the exclamation point icon.
[23:42.34]Okay.
[23:44.04]Don't worry, this mistake can be fixed easily.
[23:46.08]Why is it all over me?
[23:48.00]It's literally all over me.
[23:52.56]You can remove only the last ingredient by pointing on the ingredient container.
[23:57.85]Oh, that's actually pretty helpful.
[23:59.41]Okay.
[24:01.51]Right-click.
[24:05.18]It's still in there.
[24:06.86]It's still in the bowl.
[24:11.34]This is... Did I sneeze into this bowl?
[24:15.02]Why is it like this?
[24:16.32]Did I put a bunch of ingredients in here just like... Alright, what... There's still butter in here.
[24:24.89]In the bowl, you can move... Wait, hold on.
[24:27.45]I gotta read this slowly.
[24:28.47]Slowly.
[24:31.32]Cool.
[24:32.30]But what to do when more than one ingredient in the bowl is wrong?
[24:36.90]Throw them in the trash.
[24:38.63]Okay.
[24:42.95]Okay, now move to the trash.
[24:46.91]Who puts butter in a bowl like this?
[24:51.73]Guys.
[24:54.07]Fucking children don't even do it like that.
[24:59.79]This was sprayed out of a jokey clown seltzer bottle.
[25:04.43]Children don't do this.
[25:07.03]Okay.
[25:07.99]Where's the trash?
[25:14.85]Where's the trash?
[25:16.03]Is there a tr- oh, okay.
[25:20.23]It's still in there!
[25:21.09]Okay, with this message you get rid of the entire content of the bowl.
[25:28.14]You can also use the trash to throw away other things.
[25:30.18]I don't fucking look like this.
[25:42.81]I swear to God.
[26:15.73]I don't look like this.
[26:19.40]I swear to God, I don't look like this image.
[26:22.38]I truly don't.
[26:32.29]Fucking pepperoni forehead.
[26:34.43]Guys, I don't look like... I'm unplugging this camera.
[26:37.31]This camera is fucking messed up.
[26:42.48]You have a massive... No, I don't.
[26:43.97]There's pictures of me.
[26:45.25]There are pictures of me on the internet.
[26:47.17]I don't look like this.
[26:47.95]There are pictures of me on the internet.
[26:49.21]I don't look like this.
[26:52.69]My face has been like stretched 50% this way.
[26:56.73]I don't look like this.
[27:00.83]What?
[27:11.45]No, that's, okay, I was gonna, no, I was gonna say there's no fucking way.
[27:18.96]No, these would be, oh, these are all, okay, you guys are fucking with all these.
[27:26.70]I look like, if they ever remade Frankenstein, right?
[27:32.17]This would be, this is like a new age Frankenstein.
[27:36.91]This is like Frankenstein in high school or something, right?
[27:41.38]This would be like the Christopher Nolan Frankenstein.
[27:50.35]Frankenstein's monster.
[27:51.27]Yeah, whatever.
[27:53.11]You don't care.
[27:53.67]Alright, let's go back to what we were doing, please.
[28:03.19]Alright.
[28:10.38]Yeah, I don't know.
[28:11.34]Some cameras are just fucked up.
[28:14.14]What were we doing?
[28:15.18]Oh, yeah.
[28:15.34]Right, right, right.
[28:15.84]Okay.
[28:17.08]Use the trash bin to throw away people playing tic-tac-toe on my forehead.
[28:27.82]That's fine.
[28:29.20]Ten times smarter than everybody in this room.
[28:33.41]You know what fits right here?
[28:34.81]Hey, what's the part of your brain?
[28:36.27]What?
[28:36.45]Okay.
[28:37.11]What's the part of your... I don't give a shit.
[28:38.33]We're gonna pause for a minute.
[28:40.21]This part where your forehead is, right here.
[28:43.03]What's in there?
[28:44.03]Your frontal cortex, right?
[28:45.53]That's hearing.
[28:46.61]That's math.
[28:47.11]That's knowledge.
[28:48.15]That's baking, right?
[28:49.64]That's everything.
[28:50.60]What's in there?
[28:51.50]Hearing.
[28:52.44]What's in your frontal lobe?
[28:53.40]What is it?
[28:55.62]Useless shit?
[28:58.40]What's right... What is... What goes right here?
[29:03.61]Hearing is the only thing.
[29:06.05]It's personality and shit.
[29:08.31]Come on, man!
[29:10.67]That's where the funny noises come from?
[29:12.23]Is my brain... My brain probably looks.
[29:18.37]There's probably just this big mass in the front and then it's just squished down and flat in the middle and down at the end.
[29:27.54]It's your whole personality.
[29:36.79]Alright, let's go.
[29:38.93]Alright, you can throw anything away.
[29:40.07]Who cares?
[29:40.85]Let's get back to baking.
[29:42.61]Look at the ingredients rack.
[29:43.85]It seems that one of the ingredients you need is missing.
[29:46.89]Don't worry.
[29:47.51]This is where all the baking supplies tab and the radial menu comes from.
[29:49.90]Alright, so put this down.
[29:53.34]Put the bowl down.
[29:54.06]Alright, so let's do the radial menu and select baking supplies.
[30:00.26]I thought this was a chessboard.
[30:04.14]The baking supplies tab is where you can buy missing ingredients.
[30:08.15]Okay.
[30:09.99]Choose the missing product.
[30:11.03]I need wheat.
[30:15.23]Okay.
[30:16.55]Purchase products don't immediately arrive to your bakery.
[30:18.57]Usually you have to wait for the delivery to get to them.
[30:21.01]This can be a little troublesome.
[30:22.36]Yeah.
[30:23.56]However, you can speed up the delivery.
[30:25.54]Be careful.
[30:25.96]It may cost you.
[30:27.72]Press U on wheat flour.
[30:32.94]What?
[30:38.01]Oh, okay.
[30:39.77]Do I have to use gems for this?
[30:43.07]Thank God.
[30:44.21]This one simple trick, which will help you avoid paying for a faster delivery or waiting for ingredients to arrive, just buy all the missing products before choosing an order.
[30:53.70]Being prepared for the day will save you some money.
[30:56.54]Good.
[30:58.40]Good, okay.
[30:59.88]Now what?
[31:01.86]It's time to start... What's wrong with me?
[31:05.00]What happened?
[31:08.86]Am I donating blood right now?
[31:11.92]What's going on?
[31:14.48]What's going on here?
[31:16.26]Okay.
[31:17.06]You can collect the ingredients every time you use the scoop.
[31:22.52]Alright, the edibles are not kicking in.
[31:23.89]I haven't taken one.
[31:26.59]I think I'm getting... Somebody's just playing music in my ears.
[31:30.69]This is why I don't listen.
[31:32.43]Do you have your voice playing on a delay?
[31:33.77]No.
[31:35.13]What blood type am I?
[31:36.05]I have no idea.
[31:39.99]You know, that's actually kind of hard to figure out if you don't already know it.
[31:44.45]You have to specifically request that they do that.
[31:48.40]If you get blood taken and you ask, hey, so what's my blood type?
[31:51.14]They'll go, I don't know.
[31:52.44]They have to actually go look for that.
[31:54.70]They won't just tell you.
[32:00.46]How big is the wingspan that you have?
[32:01.58]I don't know, 15 feet?
[32:05.32]Maybe 16 feet?
[32:08.25]Alright, you can collect the ingredient by clicking.
[32:11.25]Yes.
[32:11.49]Alright, so let's go.
[32:12.59]What do I need?
[32:15.81]Into the bowl.
[32:16.59]There's still butter in this bowl.
[32:19.00]Can I rinse it?
[32:19.84]Whatever, I don't care.
[32:20.56]Alright, we need... I want ounces.
[32:26.18]So, wheat flour.
[32:27.64]Can I... Yeah, use a big spoon.
[32:29.26]What the heck am I doing this for?
[32:31.42]Just use... Just get... Just get a shovel.
[32:36.41]Alright, four ounces of flour.
[32:38.19]Get it in there.
[32:39.46]And then two ounces of flour.
[32:40.56]Get it in there.
[32:40.94]Alright, we have six ounces of flour in this bowl.
[32:45.10]We need yeast.
[32:47.54]2.24 ounces of yeast.
[32:51.92]So this is that, and then 0.2.
[32:55.02]Got it.
[32:55.86]0.24.
[32:57.03]We need milk.
[33:00.83]Full fat milk?
[33:01.85]Yuck.
[33:03.36]2.4.
[33:03.38]Alright, do that again.
[33:05.70]We're gonna do... 2.4.
[33:06.24]Bingo.
[33:10.12]We need water.
[33:11.32]Okay, water.
[33:14.30]2.4 water.
[33:15.64]Good.
[33:15.78]Sugar.
[33:17.72]Okay.
[33:17.82]0.12 ounces.
[33:32.36]Okay.
[33:33.49]Good job!
[33:33.93]Now you can mix the ingredients.
[33:36.15]Where?
[33:38.71]Transfer the dough to the mixer by press- Oh, okay.
[33:40.45]Here we go.
[33:42.79]Press- Did I do it?
[33:44.15]Alright, everything's in there.
[33:45.19]Press the button on the mixer casing and wait for the dough to be ready.
[33:48.21]Watch the widget carefully.
[33:49.18]You don't overmix the batter.
[34:00.17]Upgrade the machine.
[34:02.73]It's almost done.
[34:05.89]No, it's almost done.
[34:06.81]It's going to overmix.
[34:08.86]I can't wait seven seconds for this?
[34:17.34]Okay, so turbo mode.
[34:19.67]I thought you don't want to mix things quickly.
[34:21.21]Sometimes you don't want it to be that... Alright, be careful.
[34:25.51]How do I do a turbo mode?
[34:36.44]Hey!
[34:36.72]Hey!
[34:37.26]Turn it off!
[34:37.92]Turn it off!
[34:38.20]Turn it off!
[34:40.94]Okay.
[34:42.68]Take the bowl back.
[34:43.40]Put the dough on the forming board.
[34:47.20]What's up?
[34:47.50]Is this a forming board?
[34:50.68]Buns are formed with bare hands.
[34:52.96]Put down the bowl on the table in the middle of the bakery.
[34:57.15]Okay.
[34:57.93]With my bare hands?
[35:02.65]There are various forms of pastries, from long bread to... What's that?
[35:07.49]As you gain more and more experience, you will learn how to create different forms.
[35:10.69]But for now, let's just do a bun, okay?
[35:15.02]It's like buns.
[35:20.34]Dividing dough is the first minigame.
[35:22.04]Wait for the indicator to reach the green area and press space.
[35:24.81]That was fucking perfect.
[35:25.77]Literally right in the middle, exactly 50%.
[35:32.32]Okay.
[35:32.42]What?
[35:32.58]Grab the ring and move the images with their shadows.
[35:34.86]Form the buns.
[35:35.32]What?
[35:35.61]Oh.
[36:10.54]Now put the freshly formed buns on the tray.
[36:12.28]I keep thinking the restaurant is on fire.
[36:19.86]It keeps freaking me out.
[36:26.77]Okay, do this.
[36:27.37]Grab and hold the tray.
[36:35.75]Put it down.
[36:39.23]Oh, gra- Okay, wait, I can do it from the tray.
[36:40.93]I get it.
[36:41.19]Okay.
[36:46.55]Bake your buns.
[36:47.25]However, you have just an old oven for now.
[36:49.27]Don't worry, you'll acquire better ovens later.
[36:52.93]Open the oven door.
[36:57.41]This is so scary.
[36:59.71]I don't know how we've come to determine that this is just a normal thing to have just in people's houses and shit.
[37:04.84]I'm serious.
[37:05.48]Okay.
[37:12.72]There's no timer on this oven.
[37:13.88]I thought you're not supposed to open it.
[37:27.42]Boost?
[37:32.87]What is this doing?
[37:34.17]Holy shit, is that okay?
[37:35.59]Ow, my hands!
[37:37.93]Why is there a boost button?
[37:41.89]Find the delivery crate.
[37:44.67]Next to the door.
[37:45.89]The amount of delivery crates is always determined by the number of orders you picked up in the current day.
[37:52.80]Alright, so this is the delivery crate.
[37:59.84]Is he live?
[38:00.60]Yeah.
[38:00.88]What do you mean, is this live?
[38:02.62]Yeah.
[38:02.76]What are you talking about?
[38:04.74]How the- Those are not delivery crates?
[38:13.86]Where's the delivery crate?
[38:18.74]Oh, because the tutorial blocks me out.
[38:22.23]Okay, each delivery... Each delivery crate has the client's logo on the side to help you identify the correct crate.
[38:29.01]This one is going to be delivered in... I thought it was going to be delivered in five minutes.
[38:34.34]Okay.
[38:37.96]Okay.
[38:46.36]Where's the delivery crate?
[38:52.61]It said, the crates by the door.
[38:56.11]Is this a crate?
[39:02.13]Which one of these is closer to the door?
[39:05.81]The crates by the door.
[39:07.47]Oh yeah, just go to the crates by the door.
[39:12.01]That's not by the door, that's by the oven.
[39:15.92]Okay.
[39:16.86]Put the tray back on the counter.
[39:18.83]Now, last step.
[39:19.51]Time to prepare the buns for delivery.
[39:22.41]Pick up the crate and place it in the orange highlight in the blue area.
[39:24.73]The crate will then be moved to the delivery car.
[39:28.18]Ooh.
[39:29.14]Remember that later in the game, you'll be able to stack crates on top of each other to deliver multiple orders.
[39:33.60]Now, the order is ready for delivery.
[39:35.08]Move to the door and press to do it.
[39:36.68]Let's deliver the food.
[39:41.59]Here you can choose which order you want to deliver.
[39:43.67]You've got only one order available, so we've already picked it for you.
[39:47.03]Press the Move to City button.
[39:52.09]Yeah, this is a one-man operation.
[40:02.30]This is not the end of your task.
[40:03.68]Delivering the orders is as important as preparing them.
[40:07.92]During this part of your job, you have to be as fast as possible.
[40:11.49]Remember to watch the timer in the top of the screen.
[40:13.67]This is crazy taxi with buns.
[40:18.07]Later in the game, you'll be able to hire a courier to deliver the orders for you.
[40:23.54]In the bottom left corner, you can see a mini map that will help you navigate through the city streets.
[40:28.90]To check the whole view of the area, you can open the city map.
[40:31.94]I didn't do anything wrong.
[40:32.66]I'm already in trouble.
[40:35.56]Open the radial menu.
[40:38.55]Call for a delay.
[40:41.81]Okay.
[40:44.51]Reset position.
[40:45.37]Decline.
[40:45.99]Oh, I can just cancel the order?
[40:51.28]How come your ears are twitching?
[40:54.46]I don't know.
[40:58.26]Okay.
[40:59.26]W-A-S-D.
[41:02.05]Spacebar.
[41:03.07]Why is this original GTA?
[41:09.69]Where am I going?
[41:10.27]Oh, right here.
[41:22.37]Shit, this guy is on... That was 30 minutes or less.
[41:28.37]Deliver.
[41:39.94]What happens if you crash?
[41:40.94]I don't know.
[41:41.28]I don't want to fail the tutorial.
[41:46.97]What the fuck did I just do?
[41:49.43]Alright, time to take a little break from baking.
[41:51.86]You know what's always fun?
[41:53.22]Makeovers!
[41:55.04]It's time for the bakery to get a renovation.
[41:56.80]Okay, customization tab.
[42:01.75]Point at the main table and press the... Okay.
[42:07.87]Tables.
[42:11.95]Is this not the main table?
[42:18.90]Is it wrong?
[42:20.90]It's time for you to do a makeover scene.
[42:23.67]Which one of these is the main table?
[42:29.61]This is a main table.
[42:35.42]Should I just bought that?
[42:36.98]You just completed your first order.
[42:38.34]Don't forget what you've learned.
[42:39.44]It will be useful in your further experience as a baker.
[42:41.42]Good luck.
[42:42.56]Oh shit!
[42:50.55]Nice.
[42:52.89]Alright, let's go.
[42:53.65]I got a million dollars!
[42:59.31]I forget everything.
[42:59.85]Alright, over here.
[43:01.95]Do you want to check orders and start a new day?
[43:03.79]Wait, not yet.
[43:04.61]I gotta get ready.
[43:11.75]Am I ready?
[43:15.82]Am I ready?
[43:17.18]Yeah, alright.
[43:17.78]I just want to make sure I have everything.
[43:20.15]Alright, let's go.
[43:27.05]Okay, I thought I could just drive around.
[43:29.27]Alright, let's do it.
[43:30.57]New... It's time for a new day.
[43:32.35]We need one bronze bed.
[43:34.33]Bronze bread.
[43:37.84]Here we go.
[43:38.88]Alright, one bronze... I got eight minutes to do this?
[43:40.96]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[43:42.52]Close the map.
[43:43.18]Get the fucking map.
[43:43.98]I don't want to leave the restaurant.
[43:46.20]Stay.
[43:46.54]Okay, get off.
[43:50.34]Oh, that's what I'm looking at.
[43:51.10]Alright, let's go, go, go, go, go.
[43:52.10]What do I need?
[43:52.46]Where's the recipe?
[43:55.92]Recipe book.
[43:59.42]Ugh.
[43:59.56]Alright, just track this.
[44:01.18]Whatever, I don't care.
[44:02.84]How do I track that?
[44:03.74]Track it.
[44:05.60]Track this.
[44:06.30]I need one.
[44:06.94]Track it.
[44:07.24]Okay, let's go.
[44:09.44]Bowl.
[44:11.44]Uh, rye flour.
[44:13.72]How much do I need?
[44:14.18]1.2 pounds.
[44:14.68]That's a lot.
[44:15.26]Pounds?
[44:15.68]Pounds?
[44:22.00]That's a shitload of flour.
[44:24.20]Okay, 12 ounces of water.
[44:26.76]How much is a pound?
[44:27.84]What is a pound of water?
[44:30.12]Oh, wait, hold on.
[44:32.80]Hey, 12... What is a pound of water?
[44:38.91]Two fluid ounces of olive oil.
[44:41.55]Okay.
[44:43.33]Any milk in this?
[44:43.99]0.2 of yeast.
[44:51.05]What happened?
[44:52.09]I can't put any more stuff in here.
[44:58.57]Yeast.
[44:58.97]Okay, .2 ounces of yeast.
[45:02.27]Good.
[45:02.51]Okay, salt.
[45:03.05].2 of salt.
[45:05.05]Oh, that's sea salt.
[45:07.91].08 of sugar.
[45:08.41]Okay.
[45:10.70]How's that wrong?
[45:12.36]How do I put the sugar back?
[45:15.20]Okay, we're good.
[45:17.29]Now we need to do 30 to 50 seconds in the machine.
[45:20.55]Go.
[45:20.61]Why does it sound like an old car?
[45:40.13]Alright, then we have to form it.
[45:48.89]Okay, form it.
[45:49.47]Alright, put this down.
[45:54.75]Go.
[45:56.53]Uh, what is it called?
[45:59.06]Bronze, bronze bread.
[46:01.92]What is this?
[46:04.96]No, no, no, that's not right.
[46:05.76]That's not right.
[46:06.12]That's wrong.
[46:06.38]That's wrong.
[46:06.80]How do I do this?
[46:09.65]Is that correct?
[46:11.45]Is it, is it round bread?
[46:12.23]Is it brown?
[46:14.43]Bronze bread?
[46:15.21]Oh, shit.
[46:15.77]Oops.
[46:24.70]Just one?
[46:29.86]What fucking weird person ordered one of these?
[46:32.11]Alright, go.
[46:32.73]Turbo!
[46:40.81]What?
[46:41.05]300... How many... Can I tell the degrees of the oven?
[47:00.01]Me?
[47:03.51]Come on!
[47:03.93]I only have five minutes to do this.
[47:12.92]Steam-powered Andy.
[47:19.21]Holy shit.
[47:19.73]Oh my god, that actually looks pretty good.
[47:32.59]That looks really good.
[47:35.59]Guys, the floor is cleaner than my hands, okay?
[47:38.89]Trust me.
[47:42.74]So now where's this going?
[47:52.02]Did I order it myself?
[47:57.09]No, wait, what?
[47:59.95]Am I cooking the books and making fake business for myself?
[48:02.55]What am I doing?
[48:08.05]Can I get a better camera angle with the car?
[48:14.11]Why are there roadblocks?
[48:19.30]Wait.
[48:19.82]A.M.
[48:20.70]No.
[48:31.81]That's good?
[48:32.35]Alright, deliver.
[48:34.37]Right on time.
[48:38.16]Did I just make six?
[48:38.80]That's it?
[48:41.26]I'm saying that's it.
[48:43.06]$60 for one piece of bread seems a little absurd.
[48:46.36]Alright, cool.
[48:56.55]I got $1,060.
[48:56.69]Wait, should I clean up?
[49:05.63]No wonder it's like 80 degrees and 90 degrees in here.
[49:09.37]Do I have to clean up or is it just... That's it.
[49:11.01]Okay.
[49:16.40]Two golden bread.
[49:18.20]You got it.
[49:20.64]I think I'm actually... I'm pretty good at this.
[49:24.44]Recipe book.
[49:27.79]Golden bread.
[49:30.38]Two... Oh, wait a minute.
[49:31.72]I have to make two of these now.
[49:32.94]Alright, two.
[49:33.60]Track two.
[49:35.32]That's very helpful.
[49:36.40]Two and a half pounds of flour.
[49:37.54]Let's get it.
[49:41.96]1.2... What is it?
[49:43.24]Wheat flour?
[49:44.84]Alright.
[49:46.48]Two and a half pounds.
[49:47.62]One pint of water.
[49:48.72]Is that one... How much is a pint?
[49:55.70]Is 1.25 pounds a pint?
[49:56.28]No.
[50:02.44]How much is a pint?
[50:04.81]What's a pint?
[50:10.01]Why would I be scooping this up with one of these scoopers?
[50:14.49]I need one pint of water.
[50:15.93]What is one pint of water?
[50:17.88]How many ounces is a pint?
[50:20.96]No, don't speak in milliliters.
[50:23.10]I'm American.
[50:25.68]16 ounces is a pint?
[50:26.42]Okay.
[50:29.85]Okay.
[50:31.12]Thank you.
[50:32.22]Eight ounces of milk.
[50:34.16]Eight ounces of salt.
[50:35.37]Oh, no.
[50:36.07]Eight ounces of .56 of salt.
[50:38.87]That's .04.
[50:39.35].56.
[50:39.63]Okay.
[50:39.99].4 sugar.
[50:42.25]I got 20 minutes to do this.
[50:48.17]I'm fine.
[51:01.86]Wait, what?
[51:02.68]Uh-oh.
[51:04.52]We're good?
[51:05.30]Alright, 0.48 of yeast.
[51:11.91]Okay.
[51:12.13]Alright.
[51:13.13]30 seconds in here.
[51:13.55]Okay.
[51:38.07]Do the other bread while you wait.
[51:39.51]There's no order for it.
[51:43.57]Oh, wait!
[51:43.95]I'm doing this for too long, aren't I?
[51:45.49]Alright, we're good.
[51:45.93]Alright, this is golden bread.
[51:56.10]What kind of bread is this?
[51:56.68]Is there too much air in this?
[51:58.94]What kind of bread is this?
[51:59.68]Is this a round bread?
[52:01.18]Or is this a... What kind of bread is it?
[52:05.78]Is it long bread?
[52:06.52]Okay.
[52:17.31]Go!
[52:17.65]Okay.
[52:34.73]I feel like this is a captcha.
[52:38.00]Oh, you're better than 95% of all other players.
[52:44.16]Which, by the way, I don't know how long it's taking some people to do that shit, but even if you do it wicked slow, and you're deliberately trying to make it so you're doing it as slow as possible, you still apparently have done that faster than, like, 65% of the population.
[53:01.17]I don't... How...
[53:11.97]Let's get light on fire, right?
[53:16.11]I can't wait to open this and be like... Okay, it's behind the head.
[53:38.63]Let's go!
[53:49.81]Any more orders?
[53:51.07]No, that's it.
[53:51.43]Alright, let's go.
[53:54.58]Why are you so red?
[53:55.40]I'm filled with blood.
[53:56.98]Alright, can I get a better view of this car?
[54:10.68]This has got to be a better car view, right?
[54:12.60]I don't want this GTA camera.
[54:19.51]Is there a better view?
[54:21.35]Inputs.
[54:23.01]Okay, character actions.
[54:28.26]Minigames.
[54:29.24]Cut dough.
[54:30.08]Car movement.
[54:32.24]Change truck camera.
[54:33.76]V. Okay, hold on.
[54:36.50]That doesn't work.
[54:40.09]C.
[54:49.64]I just drove by it.
[55:13.20]I can't see the little things in front of me.
[55:21.24]Okay.
[55:22.16]I'm starting to get the hang of it.
[55:23.02]I think the game's gonna start to get a little more difficult now.
[55:28.61]Alright.
[55:29.59]Two old-fashioned loaves and three golden breads.
[55:32.71]This is going across town.
[55:39.25]Okay, I got 20 minutes.
[55:39.93]Let's go.
[55:40.97]Alright, three... Wait.
[55:44.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[55:49.28]No, wrong, wrong.
[55:50.16]Okay, three golden... No, it's... Okay.
[55:53.36]I was making sure I was tracking three.
[55:56.58]Alright.
[55:57.46]Wheat flour.
[55:58.20]3 points... Pounds.
[56:06.26]Water.
[56:06.50]1.5 pounds.
[56:07.54]Okay.
[56:07.70]Milk.
[56:07.86]12 ounces of milk.
[56:12.75]0.84 ounces of salt.
[56:15.01]Salt.
[56:21.46]Okay.
[56:23.02]Uh, sugar.
[56:23.80]It's alright.
[56:31.11]Let's do it again.
[56:31.91]It's alright.
[56:32.35]We're good.
[56:32.69]Okay, 0.72 of yeast.
[56:37.97]Good.
[56:39.61]I'm gonna try to- I'm gonna get the other stuff going too.
[56:41.11]Alright, get this started.
[56:41.91]Let's do the other one.
[56:46.31]Can I not make the other one?
[56:51.63]How do I make the other one?
[56:55.73]Can I only... Can I only do one at a time?
[57:00.79]Do I not have the capability to do more than one right now?
[57:10.91]Cheese?
[57:11.45]What?
[57:18.40]Where?
[57:18.66]Get it!
[57:22.00]Alright, three golden breads.
[57:25.12]Alright, let's make this quick.
[57:32.33]That's not three.
[57:32.89]There's only two.
[57:37.49]Why is it only two?
[58:00.02]Move!
[58:00.24]Alright, get it.
[58:04.74]20 minutes.
[58:08.02]Okay, can I start another one?
[58:14.89]You're smart, you just don't know object permanence.
[58:17.43]I mean, I know object permanence, but not really.
[58:21.61]It just doesn't stay there.
[58:23.69]If I put something down, it's hard to remember where I put it.
[58:28.70]Which is object permanence.
[58:32.72]I could dodge an axe if you swing it at me.
[58:33.94]I don't give a shit.
[58:35.51]Alright, so now what?
[58:37.81]I have 20 minutes to do this?
[58:55.96]Ooh, those look good.
[58:56.62]Alright, they're not ready yet.
[58:58.70]Now we're going to do the other one.
[59:03.08]Okay.
[59:06.56]So this one's ready.
[59:11.38]Oh, shit.
[59:12.30]I have to come back and do it.
[59:14.20]Why would I do that?
[59:16.70]This oven can fit ten pizzas in it.
[59:18.74]Why would I not do all these deliveries at the same time?
[59:23.23]Why am I doing only three pieces of bread at once?
[59:25.97]What a waste of energy.
[59:29.79]Can I... Where's my buy tool?
[59:31.07]Whatever.
[59:31.51]Let's go.
[59:39.65]I just keep... I don't know why I keep thinking about this.
[59:43.33]Oh, dude, what's the baseball stream?
[59:46.63]Oh, he's gonna shove a whole baseball up his ass.
[59:51.52]Like, at that person that asked the question.
[59:55.70]You know how many times I keep... How many times I thought about that comment?
[60:02.50]Do I even know where this is?
[60:03.22]I just lost the tire.
[60:12.45]Oh yeah, guys, sorry I gotta delay.
[60:13.87]Oh, there's tons of preparation I gotta do.
[60:16.66]Oh, what are you doing?
[60:17.60]Oh, wait, he's shoving a baseball up his ass.
[60:25.17]How do I even get over this other road?
[60:41.12]I don't want to drive like this.
[60:43.46]Why can I not be at third-person angle?
[60:48.79]What is this?
[60:49.99]Where's this bridge?
[60:51.15]Oh.
[61:05.67]Can I get a faster car?
[61:08.14]Eventually.
[61:14.08]Holy shit, that was cool.
[61:21.64]Are the cops after me?
[61:23.23]I'm still unsure of what's going on with that.
[61:34.25]Yep.
[61:40.59]This is a far away delivery.
[61:52.64]Is this the last possible place to deliver that's on the edge of the whole entire world here?
[62:06.19]This is the last possible place to take this.
[62:17.10]Donut dude.
[62:17.94]Alright, donut dude.
[62:18.96]What do I got, 150 bucks?
[62:19.50]Alright, let's go.
[62:23.82]My stomach hurts.
[62:24.78]Um... Sip on a little bit of ginger ale.
[62:27.56]Just a little.
[62:28.40]Very small sips.
[62:32.16]I have to do a new day?
[62:33.50]That's... Okay.
[62:34.37]Come on, man.
[62:38.67]Alright, this one's right down the street and it pays the same amount of money.
[62:41.51]Why would I ever do the other one?
[62:47.09]Wait, can I... How do I upgrade?
[62:54.54]600 bucks for what?
[63:07.97]I just changed the finish of the wood.
[63:11.27]Oh, it's everywhere.
[63:12.91]Okay.
[63:15.23]I actually prefer the other one.
[63:18.15]Alright, let's get started.
[63:18.87]Come on.
[63:25.24]Uh, it was bronze bread, right?
[63:27.50]How many?
[63:31.38]Three bronze breads.
[63:36.20]3.75 pounds of rye flour.
[63:42.70]2.5 pints.
[63:45.56]That's din-din, din-din.
[63:47.48]Din?
[63:48.74]No.
[63:50.06]Din?
[63:51.88]Olive oil.
[63:52.34]Six ounces of olive oil.
[63:55.30]Is there actually olive oil?
[63:56.86]I guess there would be, yeah.
[63:58.22]Alright, 0.6 of yeast.
[64:01.64]What happened?
[64:04.86]Okay, that thing would have came alive.
[64:15.10]Salt.
[64:18.80]Sugar.
[64:30.94]The fuck is this?
[64:36.72]Who delivered the Willy Wonka candy machine?
[64:40.58]When the... What is this thing?
[64:43.83]Alright, free bronze bread.
[64:45.99]I can't say it.
[64:53.71]Excuse me?
[64:54.29]What's happening here?
[64:59.84]What happened?
[65:02.75]Fucking go!
[65:12.43]Was this brown bread?
[65:13.19]Yeah.
[65:16.35]Toy Boat check?
[65:18.58]Okay, yeah.
[65:19.56]That's right.
[65:21.64]Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat.
[65:27.62]Oh, it's close.
[65:28.48]I got it.
[65:29.56]Pretty close.
[65:36.69]That's the wrong way.
[65:43.92]This game's pretty chill.
[65:56.87]Oh, Undertale.
[66:06.12]Where'd it go?
[66:07.34]What happened?
[66:10.08]Oh, it's over there.
[66:13.29]The music.
[66:16.19]It sounded like Undertale.
[66:17.25]Do I have to... Come on.
[66:32.44]Come on.
[66:37.91]I'm not fighting you on this one.
[66:45.22]It's not even close.
[66:51.18]Come on, that's like the dog theme, right?
[66:58.44]I'm kidding.
[66:59.06]Holy smokes.
[67:03.67]Ooh, look at this.
[67:06.55]Don't you feel like that you would take this piece of bread and you would go like... It would make... You would be like... You can't bite it.
[67:19.41]And you just put it down.
[67:26.59]And then somebody would come over with a big ass knife.
[67:29.28]And it would be like...
[67:49.73]I like the middle.
[67:56.97]Everyone out here trying to be the next Ball Fondler.
[67:59.79]Yeah.
[68:00.89]Yeah, sorry, man.
[68:03.27]You're just gonna get timed out for... You know what I mean?
[68:09.51]People out here trying to, you know, follow that trend of what Ball Fondler said.
[68:13.86]Man.
[68:23.35]By the way, mods, that comment is strange because there is no turkey baster.
[68:27.90]There's no... There's nothing here.
[68:39.25]This is not a turkey baster.
[68:43.17]Where?

[71:29.58]It's one ounce.
[71:30.24]Does it really have to be exact?
[71:35.52]Okay.
[71:39.42]Put it in here.
[71:39.92]I have not even turned this machine on.
[71:41.22]I don't think it has to be exact.
[72:01.15]Stop using Imperial?
[72:02.23]I have to use Imperial.
[72:03.47]I would not be able to do it the other way.

[72:17.40]I hope.
[72:28.90]Do it!
[72:31.69]When are we going to get new emotes?
[72:33.49]Here's when you're going to get new emotes.
[72:34.87]I say every six months that new emotes are coming.
[72:38.44]And I haven't added a new emote since 2018.
[72:43.62]So... Just take that, I guess, with how... Take that how you will.
[72:51.95]We just put it on BTTV.
[72:53.51]You know what I mean?
[72:54.97]I don't... It just goes on Better twitch.tv.
[73:15.67]Does that hurt everybody's ears?
[73:20.07]Is it bad?
[73:27.67]Upgrade the oven.
[73:28.85]Oh my god.
[73:29.53]A good old simple oven can bake up to two oven trays.
[73:35.81]Why can't I upgrade it?
[73:36.47]I just own it.
[73:41.77]Can I replace it?
[73:43.89]I don't think I can replace it.
[73:56.50]You?
[73:59.14]I pressed you.
[74:01.04]That's me pressing you to open that submenu.
[74:08.33]Alright.
[74:10.19]First person to get this right gets a pretend gold star.
[74:14.05]What song is this?
[74:15.29]Let's do it.
[74:15.99]Ready?
[74:16.83]What song is it?
[74:17.77]Mods, keep track of your programs.
[74:20.02]I wonder who gets this first.
[74:39.12]I'm not doing it again.
[74:48.94]They're fine.
[74:49.36]Alright, I'm going to say it.
[75:04.71]There was a Stone Cold Steve Austin intro song.
[75:06.99]Did anybody get it?
[75:13.57]Anybody get it?
[75:16.75]Who said it?
[75:17.83]Who got it?
[75:24.32]See, in my brain, how did you not get that?
[75:27.38]To me, that is such an iconic piece of musical medley that there's no way you would not have gotten that.
[75:35.61]Nothing else sounds like that.
[75:38.70]By the way, do you guys think that the person that makes all the WWF, WCW, whatever theme songs, that person has more... They've made so many iconic pieces of music.
[75:54.37]Right?
[75:54.65]Think about that.
[75:56.03]Some of the most recognizable tunes ever created were made by the WWE music composer guy.
[76:06.53]Don't you feel like they deserve a lot more credit?
[76:12.94]You think the guy that made the Undertaker's theme song sits around going... That's one of the most recognized... That's the Super Mario of music.
[76:22.92]Like, seriously.
[76:29.47]I think he deserves a little more credit.
[76:41.03]It's not one guy.
[76:42.37]Well, it's a, I don't know, group.
[76:43.67]Who makes it?
[76:45.63]That's the most boomer shit I've ever heard in my life.
[76:51.71]Okay.
[76:53.91]Back up.
[76:57.08]If I played for you the first 10 seconds of, do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
[77:03.00]And then 10 seconds of whatever music is popular right now, how many people would recognize The Rock's theme song versus something that is like popular kind of right now?
[77:13.18]How many humans on Earth would recognize The Rock's theme song?
[77:18.97]And you tell me this is boomer shit.
[77:24.86]relevancy bias in a hundred years is it really relevancy bias because I just told you right now that stone cold theme song glass break you know what that song is immediately everybody trends come and go artists come and go but stone cold steve Austin's theme song is forever you will never forget it I'm sorry I feel like that's pretty iconic 100 years from now they'll know that
[77:53.79]I don't know that.
[77:54.55]I don't.
[77:54.97]I don't.
[77:55.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[77:58.05]We didn't know.
[77:58.81]Literally, we couldn't do it.
[78:01.37]Yeah, but there's a difference between me going like... And you actually... There's a difference.
[78:09.71]Between... Hold on.
[78:10.77]Let's just fucking... You know what I'm saying?
[78:13.90]Don't make me do this.
[78:17.30]Don't make me... Okay, here we go.
[78:19.18]How many people in chat know what this is?
[78:21.32]How many people in chat know what this is?
[78:25.42]I want to see it.
[78:25.94]Just shout it out when you get it.
[78:38.26]That's right.
[78:39.52]That's right.
[78:41.70]No, this is not the Home Depot theme song.
[78:44.46]This is... This is not Home Depot.
[78:50.54]This is not the Home Depot theme song.
[78:55.99]This is the world's most dangerous man, Ken Shamrock.

[79:07.38]It sounds a little like Home Depot.

[96:55.23]It would just be sour.
[96:57.09]Would it?
[97:01.86]It would be cheese.
[97:03.38]Isn't cheese a much different process though?
[97:04.96]Those of you asking why I'm doing this, is to be able to get nine of them.
[97:13.02]What the fuck are you talking about?
[97:24.73]I thought I was gonna be able to split them.
[97:27.05]It wouldn't be cheese, no.
[97:37.44]Oh, that one's ugly.
[97:40.31]Whatever.
[97:40.67]They don't even care.
[97:41.63]I still got 80%, guys.
[97:43.75]Whatever.
[97:53.53]I'm going to have to take them out anyways.
[97:55.34]I have to wait.
[98:05.16]I still have 12 minutes.
[98:07.56]What hair gel do you use?
[98:08.56]I don't use hair gel.
[98:10.40]I don't put any product in my hair.
[98:12.93]Ever.
[98:16.21]Alright, come on.
[98:16.59]Let's go.
[98:21.75]Liar.
[98:22.15]That's not a lie.
[98:24.55]I shampoo and condition.
[98:26.58]But that's it.
[98:35.09]No, I don't put hair gel in my hair.
[98:37.23]Do you know why I don't put any product in my hair?
[98:40.59]Because all the way from when I was a teenager up until my late 20s, anytime I put hair gel in my hair, I would get this.
[98:50.18]It didn't matter if it was, oh, you got to get a different brand.
[98:52.46]You got to get this brand.
[98:53.22]You got to use a pomade.
[98:54.28]Don't use that.
[98:54.88]Use mousse.
[98:55.38]Didn't matter what I did.
[98:56.86]Don't use that much.
[98:57.84]Use a little.
[98:58.34]It doesn't matter.
[99:00.19]I would get this line right here.
[99:03.57]this line of acne that because it would just get kind of greasy and sweaty and I hated it and I'd get this line of pimples and acne so I just started saying I'm going to use a really good conditioner really good shampoo like very very high quality and go from there and I don't put anything in my hair
[99:31.56]I'm missing two.
[99:32.34]Alright, two.
[99:33.96]Where's the bowl?
[99:37.30]Alright, two more breads.
[99:38.16]It's going to be cold, but they'll get it.
[99:40.39]Okay, let's go.
[99:47.83]I mean, plus my hair is kind of wavy anyway, so I don't really need to put nothing in my hair.
[99:52.81]My hair will naturally just go swoop, swoop, swoop.
[99:58.74]Baked milk.
[100:01.26]Baked milk might be better for you.
[100:05.22]It's good for people with intestinal issues.
[100:09.60]Well, it should.
[100:10.14]Okay.
[100:11.91]Alright.
[100:12.33]Water.
[100:16.43]What song was that?
[100:20.39]What song was that one?
[100:27.12]It was Super Mario.
[100:29.56]Sorry.
[100:29.92]You got it wrong.
[100:36.76]Alright, where's the... What the fuck is going on?
[100:49.81]This one will be normal.
[100:51.37]This one's gonna be good.
[100:57.76]It's alright.
[100:58.06]2.6, 2.5, 2.52, 2.48, 2.44, 2.4.
[101:15.24]That's what I did.
[101:17.34]Alright.
[101:18.66]I can probably start putting these away.
[101:26.27]What?
[101:31.46]Excuse me.
[101:32.84]Puppet's bun?
[101:34.96]Puppet's bread.
[101:45.27]What's the difference?
[101:46.98]Puppets bread.
[101:48.22]Puppets bun.
[101:53.72]I mean, these ones got bacteria growing on them anyways.
[102:04.93]That's annoying.
[102:06.13]Oh my god.
[102:06.59]I'm about to quit the game.
[102:09.53]I'm about to quit the game.
[102:10.09]I'm going to quit the game.
[102:25.60]Um, alright, well, let me see if I can... How many do I have in here?
[102:36.05]So it's not a lot... So it would be a round bread.
[102:39.01]This is correct, right?
[102:41.93]This would be a puppet bun.
[102:43.05]I only have enough for two?
[102:44.91]How do I only have enough for two?
[102:52.70]Bro, I don't know.
[103:10.35]Cringe fail baker.
[103:13.15]This is not even accurate.
[103:14.15]This is Puppet's Bread still.
[103:16.65]How do I make a bun?
[103:24.33]What?
[103:26.19]Bagels, croissants, baguettes, longbreads.
[103:28.97]Oh my... It's literally right there.
[103:33.07]Oh my god, that's annoying.
[103:35.17]Just put it back on here and we'll redo it.
[103:36.90]Just reform it.
[103:51.81]Holy shit, I think I have enough to do it.
[103:59.44]I have enough to do it.
[104:01.08]This is saved.
[104:05.40]No, I have enough to do it.
[104:06.14]I have six minutes, but I should be okay.
[104:24.81]How many is that?
[104:27.76]This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[104:33.30]Alright, that's 9.
[104:34.76]Go.
[104:46.43]Puppets.
[104:47.19]These are buns.
[104:48.47]How are these still... I don't understand.
[104:50.01]That's buns.
[104:51.73]I just chopped them into buns and I formed them into buns.
[105:02.06]I don't care.
[105:03.50]Those are literally buns.
[105:07.68]Go to the clipboard?
[105:20.77]What's happening?
[105:23.95]Who's that?
[105:25.41]Oh, I was like, who the fuck is this...
[105:28.53]Three puppets alone in the dark?
[105:31.09]I was like, who is this?
[105:34.51]I didn't accept the recipe?
[105:36.11]So what can I... I'm so confused.
[105:46.12]Self-made tasks.
[105:53.20]Alright, whatever.
[105:53.92]I'll start over.
[105:54.42]I only have four minutes.
[105:55.90]It's over.
[105:56.33]Just quit.
[105:56.59]Just quit.
[105:58.71]Just redo it.
[106:05.99]Somebody just walked in with a fucking pan and went like right in the back of my head.
[106:12.10]And I just went to black.

[107:27.51]Okay, sourdough starter.
[107:39.23]You put a pint of this?
[107:42.35]What?
[107:46.43]I thought it was just like baking soda.
[107:47.87]I didn't think it was something else.
[107:49.37]What's in this?
[107:50.07]I need to buy more of this shit.
[108:00.73]Okay.
[108:02.47]I thought it was baking soda.
[108:09.39]It's ridiculously hard to get right.
[108:10.93]Do I have no money?
[108:18.92]Oh.
[108:24.40]Do you guys have any experience making sourdough?
[108:30.70]Alright, 1.4 ounces of salt.
[108:32.48]I'll get it right first try.
[108:42.05]Alright, only 15 seconds in the mixer.
[108:50.12]You have to put bugs in it.
[108:51.08]I don't think you do.
[108:55.52]Okay, then this is bake for 70 seconds at... Did I spill any?
[109:10.39]Oh, what if I don't just bake it, I have to form it?
[109:13.10]Alright, what is a farmer's loaf?
[109:23.43]What's a farmer's loaf?
[109:30.07]Is it a long bread?
[109:32.27]I hope that's right.
[109:32.83]I need three.
[109:39.12]how the fuck is this not yeah that's two and one little tiny shitty one dude I could go for a huge pretzel right now you know what honestly a big crunchy hot pretzel
[110:02.29]This might shock some of you.
[110:04.44]Might be the single greatest food item that's ever been invented by humans.
[110:13.78]It really actually could be.
[110:15.70]If I really sit here and I really think about it.
[110:19.03]That could be the greatest tasting, greatest thing in the world.
[110:21.65]In the whole world.
[110:25.07]Golf sucks.
[110:26.15]Yeah, it does.
[110:28.01]Why do you think I'm going to disagree with you on that?
[110:34.36]No, a pretzel.
[110:35.48]A nice, hot, soft pretzel with a thing of honey mustard or spicy mustard or even like cheese, nacho cheese or something.
[110:42.11]Or just straight up right out of the oven.
[110:45.49]Just a little bit of salt on it.
[110:48.59]Oh my god.
[110:49.39]Pizza's perfect.
[110:52.41]Yeah.
[110:52.77]A really good pizza...
[111:02.19]I don't think it makes me have a child's palate.
[111:06.83]I think... Oh, man.
[111:08.56]The best steak I've ever had in my life.
[111:10.30]The best steak.
[111:11.02]No.
[111:12.34]I would rather take the best pizza I've ever had in my life over the best steak I've ever had in my life.
[111:18.16]Also, I'd rather have the best piece of salmon I've ever had in my life over the best steak I've ever had in my life.
[111:22.85]Steak is overrated.
[111:23.83]It just really... I don't know.
[111:25.49]I really just think it is.
[111:31.32]I genuinely believe that.
[111:34.16]I know it's really good, it is, but I kind of think it's overrated.
[111:49.42]Pizza and Salmon Pog.
[111:54.28]When I have a really nice piece of meat, oh, wow, dude, this is like ribeye, or this is wagyu, whatever.
[112:02.79]I've had it before.
[112:03.71]It's like, yeah, that was really, really good.
[112:09.63]But it's not good enough for me to care that much, to me.
[112:13.57]I think it's incredibly, it is, it's very good.
[112:16.50]But I don't know.
[112:18.48]The best piece of fish I've ever had is higher than the best piece of steak I've ever had.
[112:37.89]But it's not even a red meat thing for me, because... Okay.
[112:43.43]I love cheeseburgers.
[112:45.53]I love steak and cheese subs.
[112:47.55]Steak bomb, right?
[112:50.15]I love meatballs.
[112:51.33]I love red meat.
[112:53.17]But I don't like the red meat where the red meat is just, hey, eat it.
[112:56.49]It's just a piece of red meat on a plate.
[112:58.83]No, I don't like that.
[113:04.73]It needs more.
[113:05.54]There's got to be something else there.
[113:09.93]Season it.
[113:10.85]You know what I mean?
[113:11.73]I don't... I'm just not into the whole... Alright, I got a steak.
[113:16.55]And then there's broccoli and mashed potatoes on the plate too.
[113:21.21]Even with a bunch of good seasoning or a marinade or whatever.
[113:32.34]Garlic herb butter?
[113:33.32]Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[113:37.56]It's phenomenal, you're right.
[113:44.69]But I've had a piece of salmon before that I'm not kidding.
[113:47.99]And look, you can say this about a steak you had too, but I've never.
[113:53.76]I've had a piece of salmon before.
[113:54.86]I don't remember the restaurant.
[113:57.16]I genuinely don't remember.
[113:58.38]I do not know.
[114:00.46]It was in the North End in Boston.
[114:03.14]And I seriously thought that it felt like God came down and talked to me for like 10 minutes.
[114:10.50]It was just, it came out, it was no bullshit.
[114:14.04]It was just this delicious, fresh piece of salmon.
[114:18.27]And the fork, it was sitting on, I think, a piece of asparagus, whatever the hell it was.
[114:24.39]And I remember taking my fork, and I went to go touch it, and the whole thing disintegrated.
[114:29.76]It was just like... I was like, what the holy... So then you fork off a little bit, and by the time it hit my lips, right here...
[114:39.06]It was like cotton candy.
[114:41.88]It was just like... It was like cotton candy.
[114:49.80]Didn't taste like cotton candy, but it acted like that.
[114:52.82]It was just gone.
[114:54.94]And I remember just going like this.
[114:55.94]I dropped the fork.
[114:57.06]I went like... And I was with my family.
[115:03.87]And I was just like... I don't know.
[115:06.45]I don't even know what I can say about that.
[115:12.05]Ratatouille?
[115:16.92]Did you eat cat food?
[115:17.96]Whatever.
[115:25.63]It was so good.
[115:28.32]And I remember when the waiter came over, I remember just... And do this, by the way.
[115:32.94]If you really do like something, I'm serious, please start doing this.
[115:36.62]If you eat something at a restaurant, you go, that was actually really, really well made and really well done.
[115:41.24]That was fantastic.
[115:42.16]That was unbelievable.
[115:44.81]Tell the waiter.
[115:46.55]Go, hey, tell whoever's back there that that was fucking phenomenal.
[115:52.31]That was phenomenal.
[115:54.05]And they should be proud of that.
[115:55.25]They should be absolutely proud of what they did.
[116:00.46]I'm seriou- and then you- they go back to it, they say, hey, uh, the salmon at table four, they were like, that was the best salmon they've ever had.
[116:07.98]You know what I mean?
[116:08.52]Like, they need to know that.
[116:10.04]They've gotta know.
[116:12.62]That's not Ratatouille!
[116:21.16]Wouldn't Ratatouille be if I hated food and hated the restaurant or something?
[116:27.71]from a chef that makes our day.
[116:29.59]Yeah, and guess what?
[116:30.71]If you know that somebody is eating your food and they think it's like one of the best things they've ever had in their life, that's gonna be like, alright, let's go!
[116:39.69]Let's go.
[116:39.95]You like that salmon?
[116:41.91]You should try my catfish.
[116:43.99]Give that a try.
[116:46.41]I've got a risotto on this menu.
[116:49.97]It's gonna be good.
[116:52.45]Did you ask for the chef's number?
[116:57.91]No.
[117:02.48]Okay, so let's go.
[117:03.10]What am I doing?
[117:08.58]That's a rich person restaurant.
[117:10.10]No?
[117:12.46]Some of the best food that I've had has come from places that were not expensive.
[117:17.61]It's the person behind the goddamn curtain.
[117:20.75]Don't you understand?
[117:21.33]It's the person behind the curtain.
[117:25.31]I've been to really expensive restaurants and the food sucked absolute asshole.
[117:32.25]I've been to restaurants where you'd go, holy shit, this is... That's how much the entrees are?
[117:37.80]And it's some of the best food I've had in a long time.
[117:42.24]It's the person behind the curtain.
[117:57.87]That's a weird flex.
[118:01.25]Guys, I've been to McDonald's that are better than some five-star restaurants I've been to.
[118:08.16]I'm telling you, this is my real take.
[118:14.50]The way that I feel biting into a double cheeseburger from McDonald's, and how delicious it is, and then eating... Oh, this is a pan-seared frickin' fish steak with tuna-grazed roe on it, and it has a piece of parsley all over it, and it's... No, I don't like this.
[118:37.55]I've eaten stuff like that before.
[118:39.31]And I've had stuff like that that was very good, and I've had stuff like that that's very bad.
[118:44.39]Would you ever eat a snake?
[118:45.57]No.
[118:46.59]No.
[118:49.65]Nice child's palate.
[118:52.55]I know for a fact that there are people in this chat right now that have eaten at McDonald's and had a five-star restaurant like filet mignon and went, that one sucked.
[119:01.32]That was not that great.
[119:02.16]That actually was kind of not good.
[119:06.94]I know for a fact you've done it.
[119:09.22]I'm positive.
[119:12.95]I know for a fact that you've been sitting in the back of a car that went to the drive-thru, and you were eating fries out of the bag, sneaking them.
[119:21.90]Just eating fries out of the bag.
[119:22.84]You were with a bunch of friends, whatever.
[119:24.44]And you enjoyed that more than a tuna tartare that you had at a four-star restaurant before.
[119:31.68]I know it.
[119:32.98]Don't pull one over on me.
[119:39.27]And by the way, why are you eating tuna tartare?
[119:41.20]Why are you eating steak tartare?
[119:43.08]What's wrong with you?
[119:49.28]Somebody on the phone right now that called the restaurant.
[119:53.75]So, I mean, I ordered three pieces of farmer's loaf.
[119:56.93]Is that coming or?
[119:59.69]At this delivery, I'm already burnt five minutes.
[120:09.32]Tuna tartare is sushi.
[120:11.19]Alright, yeah, no, no, no, that's right.
[120:12.95]Steak tartare though, I'm sorry.
[120:15.95]I'm sorry, I just don't, I don't understand why people do that.
[120:20.73]I don't understand why people do that.
[120:22.21]I don't get it.
[120:27.95]What is it?
[120:28.67]Tell me what it is about it.
[120:30.57]Steak tartare, but tell me why.
[120:33.51]Tell me why.
[120:34.09]Why are there so many viewers?
[120:38.49]I don't know.
[120:44.72]Wait, okay, somebody called me an idiot.
[120:45.72]Hold on.
[120:46.38]Somebody said you're a fucking idiot.
[120:47.44]Why?
[120:48.04]But why?
[120:50.14]Somebody said... Oh, why do you say tartar like that, you fucking idiot?
[120:53.98]I thought you were calling me an idiot because you liked tartar and you were giving me a reason why.
[121:00.59]How am I saying it wrong?
[121:01.61]Steak tartar?
[121:03.23]Tartar?
[121:03.63]How do you say it?
[121:06.81]That's how you say it.
[121:08.21]Tartar?
[121:09.33]Tartar.
[121:10.03]Tartar.
[121:11.19]Tartar.
[121:11.67]What?
[121:11.91]What?
[121:15.04]You guys follow... I'm saying it right?
[121:22.95]That's correct.
[121:28.99]Steak tartare.
[121:30.87]Steak tartare.
[121:32.01]Okay, thank you.
[121:35.19]Steak tartare.
[121:37.31]One more time for everybody that was listening.
[121:39.29]Steak tartare.
[121:46.17]How do you pronounce steak tartare correctly?
[121:52.14]It's a regional thing?
[121:59.41]Oh, I have an ad.
[122:06.33]We are looking at how to pronounce this name, as well as how to say more interesting French cooking terms, too, that many get wrong.
[122:14.41]So make sure to stay tuned for those.
[122:16.72]OK.
[122:17.34]This is the real deal.
[122:18.56]This is a meat dish made from raw ground beef.
[122:23.58]Some say it can also be made from horse, even though even in France, that's really not very common.
[122:30.28]Anyhow, how do you say it?
[122:32.60]For reference, in French, in France, it is said as steak tartare.
[122:38.21]Oh, come on!
[122:39.73]Therefore, in English, it is generally said as steak tartare.
[122:45.08]And that, by the way, this is directly from... I win.
[122:52.66]I win.
[123:02.96]Steak tartare.
[123:03.98]Steak tartare.
[123:04.52]That's what I said.
[123:05.64]Why are people so mean to me?
[123:06.88]Okay.
[123:10.48]That was 11 minutes, by the way.
[123:12.60]The guy on the phone is still there.
[123:15.04]Dude, I don't care about steak tartare, dude.
[123:17.70]I mean, you have, like... You've got, like, a five-star review, so I'm gonna sit here and wait for the bread.
[123:21.98]But... Are you alright?
[123:27.00]Alright, let's go.
[123:30.16]Track it.
[123:34.16]What am I even doing?
[123:37.46]French is not a real language.
[123:44.53]Okay.
[123:44.73]I don't know.
[123:45.89]What does that mean?
[123:46.35]Alright.
[123:46.85]Bronze bread.
[123:47.49]Four.
[123:47.81]Let's go.
[123:53.15]Why are we... What?
[123:55.56]Five pounds of rye flour.
[123:57.08]Is this going to be too much?
[124:05.07]I understand, okay, raw, I understand raw food, like raw fish, right?
[124:08.56]I understand it.
[124:10.78]But something about raw hamburger meat.
[124:18.54]Raw hamburger meat smells.
[124:23.13]It has this smell to it, kind of like I talked about with raw eggs.
[124:27.67]I don't want to eat that.
[124:29.43]And it's not ground beef.
[124:31.87]What do you mean?
[124:32.75]It's a hamburger meat.
[124:34.47]It's raw meat!
[124:36.87]It's not... Yeah, alright, I get it.
[124:39.53]You're not going to the grocery store and getting a pound of ground beef and eating it raw with a fork, okay?
[124:46.39]Hold on.
[124:46.91]Hold that thought.
[125:01.62]Yeast, okay.
[125:05.41]Salt.
[125:07.82]Sugar.
[125:09.38]Whoa, too much.
[125:15.76]It's the natural way of eating it.
[125:18.09]I just don't... I don't like it.
[125:26.21]I don't...
[125:32.35]And I'm not even saying... Dude, it needs to be well done.
[125:35.19]I'm just saying it needs to be cooked.
[125:41.29]Alright, but honestly, who started cooking food?
[125:44.15]Why did we start cooking food then?
[125:47.48]Right?
[125:47.78]Like, who started cooking food?
[125:55.68]Cavemen?
[125:58.70]So you're telling me that the cavemen...
[126:01.54]We're like, raw meat.
[126:06.16]Yes.
[126:07.16]And then all of a sudden they put it over a fire.
[126:12.09]And then went, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[126:17.75]And they all started fucking screaming.
[126:19.95]They decided that.
[126:20.87]We didn't, the only reason why we do this now is because the cavemen decided to put, burn a warthog that they fucking found in the forest.
[126:41.11]What was this again?
[126:41.67]I don't remember.
[126:42.69]Alright, bronze bread.
[126:44.37]And it's just a regular brown bread.
[126:54.28]We started cooking food... Hold on, somebody's got the answer.
[126:56.40]Actually, I'm very curious about this.
[126:58.06]I really am.
[126:58.48]I swear to God.
[127:00.59]Cooking food allowed us to get more nutrients out of it, so people who cooked food survived more than those that didn't.
[127:07.69]We started cooking food because our teeth became less sharp, and we also didn't want to die of diseases, you English major.
[127:14.48]Different people do different specialties, and that's what I need to know every single thing.
[127:18.48]I have to be a doctor, an English teacher, a scientist, and an astronaut?
[127:23.95]People do different things.
[127:38.91]But to me, it tastes better.
[127:42.87]Like a medium, even like medium rare, right?
[127:45.38]Medium to medium rare, medium.
[127:47.36]To me, that tastes better to me than just eating it raw.
[127:51.48]And we add, you know, garlic and butter and flavors and parsley and... Oh, I want one now.
[128:02.63]Bro, this is high school knowledge.
[128:07.36]Yeah?
[128:11.03]That's what the cavemen thought too.
[128:21.70]You know how many people... It's crazy to think about this, honestly.
[128:27.06]The flavors that we like... Over thousands and thousands and thousands of years...
[128:35.17]Cavemen were just going and picking up berries and squishing them and putting them on their steak.
[128:40.39]And eating it.
[128:41.93]And just dying.
[128:45.07]No, no.
[128:46.31]No, don't eat those.
[128:48.32]It's crazy.
[128:55.64]Like, I'm under the first person to piss on the fire.
[128:58.60]No, pee, piss on fire.
[129:01.23]No, I don't know.
[129:02.25]I don't know about that.
[129:03.17]Yes, forever.
[129:06.14]And then they ate that guy.
[129:27.15]Where's my bread?
[129:28.35]They didn't start making bread until... P-P on food.
[129:36.56]Yeah, they had to be away.
[129:40.72]You would eat a person?
[129:42.02]No, I'm saying that they maybe, I don't know.
[129:45.38]I wouldn't, I'm just saying it back a fucking million years ago.
[129:48.13]Guys, they didn't have the McDonald's drive-through.
[129:52.01]I don't know.
[130:03.27]I don't know.
[130:03.87]You don't know what it was like a million years ago.
[130:09.22]Nice granddad joke.
[130:24.48]You guys are fucking so funny.
[130:31.62]But yeah, they probably put so much gross shit all over their food.
[130:38.40]Can you imagine how disgusting food probably was for a long time?
[130:44.29]That's for us to complain.
[130:45.85]Oh, um, excuse me.
[130:48.46]This drink is a little too sweet.
[130:51.62]Redo it.
[131:08.43]They had steak tartare, though, and I'm sure it was good.
[131:16.67]That's literally you.
[131:18.54]I actually don't complain about food if it's wrong.
[131:22.16]I really don't.
[131:26.04]Okay, it has to be very, very wrong.
[131:29.46]Very wrong.
[131:38.67]You know how much of a pain in the ass it is to deal with a shitload of people?
[131:43.95]You know what's crazy?
[131:45.31]Here we go.
[131:45.83]Okay, everyone, hold on.
[131:46.73]Here comes the take.
[131:48.41]The amount of people that you see in, let's say, like a McDonald's drive-thru.
[131:53.31]Think of how crazy it gets at a lot of these places.
[132:00.05]There are sometimes 10 plus 20 cars for hours outside of these McDonald's restaurants.
[132:07.08]Or Burger King.
[132:07.72]It doesn't matter.
[132:11.67]It's... Oh no, I wanted a sprite and you gave me a Coke.
[132:17.38]Okay.
[132:18.98]That's alright.
[132:19.72]Like, whatever.
[132:20.36]That's not a big deal to me.
[132:21.76]It really isn't.
[132:28.57]Now, if I ordered, you know, two double cheeseburgers, a fry, and a Coke, and I got three chicken sandwiches, a McFlurry, this is not my order.
[132:38.76]This is not even close.
[132:39.92]Like, I'll be like, oh, hey, no problem at all, but this is probably somebody else's order.
[132:44.42]Alright, what's the next one that's coming up?
[132:56.36]What am I even on?
[132:57.02]Okay, wait, didn't I do this?
[133:05.66]Wow, that's a great take.
[133:11.02]That really wasn't a take, really, now that I... Yeah, you're right.
[133:13.80]That actually wasn't a take.
[133:16.68]What was the take?
[133:20.48]I just said... That's fucking crazy.
[133:24.20]That's not a take.
[133:27.12]Hey, dude, that's crazy.
[133:29.22]Alright, let's move on.
[133:32.05]The take is I don't complain.
[133:34.99]Oh, that's right.
[133:35.81]Well, no.
[133:36.29]No, no, no.
[133:36.59]My take is that... Alright, here's the take.
[133:38.88]That a lot of people that work in the fast food industry have to deal with a lot of horse shit.
[133:43.16]And I don't want to be one of those people that adds to the stress of, like, a bunch of people fucking screaming at them through the intercom and, like, fucking with them through the... Like, you know, like, fucking with them and... It's a lot of bullshit.
[133:54.46]Um... So, I don't know.
[133:56.64]I try to... And why can't we tip at the fucking window?! !
[134:14.65]Some places, they can't.
[134:17.01]No, we can't.
[134:18.51]We can't do that.
[134:22.01]Not saying that, you know, obviously people, you know, tipping is a whole other can of worms, right?
[134:31.96]But a lot of places, you can't.
[134:38.96]Why do we have to tip?
[134:41.47]Yeah I know. I know, I know. It's like confusing and it's like the worker is relying on your tip because they're just not getting paid to be there at a wage that's a reasonable fucking wage, right?
[134:53.47]So it's like: Is it twenty percent? Is it fifteen percent? Is it forty percent? Thirty percent? Is it twelve percent?
[134:58.47]What if I do fifteen percent? Is that bad? What's wrong? What did you do? What's your tip? We doing tips together?
[135:03.47]Should we give fifty? Should I give a hundred dollars? I'm gonna give a hundred dollars. Should I give ten?
[135:06.47]I get it - I do.
[135:12.15]But I will also be honest too, though.
[135:14.03]I do like to, if somebody's, you know, really nice and they do a good job and it's like, you know, you're actually, you're working your ass off here.
[135:22.50]Fuck it.
[135:22.72]I'll give you, why not?
[135:24.48]I get it.
[135:27.12]But that, that's on me, right?
[135:28.28]That's on the individual.
[135:32.06]Yeah.
[135:36.16]Really doing a good job placing these trays over and over again.
[135:42.71]And sometimes tipping gets weird because... How expensive was the meal, right?
[135:52.30]It gets weird.
[135:57.50]Technically, we paid for the tip.
[136:00.76]Yeah.
[136:06.05]You know, also, too, a lot of times tipping...
[136:10.33]If the restaurant just paid... You think about what your check would be, right?
[136:16.76]Let's say your check is $20 or $30, $40.
[136:18.77]The extra money that you'd be tipping
[136:23.43]I don't know, there's probably some mathematician or economist in here.
[136:27.34]But like, if you took away the tipping, and even if you needed to charge a little more for the food, I'm not paying potentially more to tip and pay for the food.
[136:40.63]And you could pay potentially the workers better, right?
[136:44.25]Can an economist tell me that here?
[136:50.75]Even if you made the food more expensive.
[136:54.11]By enough, but it didn't reach that point where it was the tip on top of it, right?
[137:00.76]Run a restaurant, then you get back to me.
[137:03.68]I know, dude, I'm talking up my ass.
[137:05.38]I know.
[137:11.21]Am I gonna make bread or what?
[137:21.38]Alright, stop.
[137:23.26]I can literally do one thing at a time.
[137:25.40]Alright, four.
[137:27.66]I need... By the way, I'm going to play a different game after this.
[137:32.00]This game's fun.
[137:34.08]But I'm going to do something else.
[137:45.42]I think this game's relaxing.
[137:47.18]This is a very nice relaxing gameplay.
[138:04.90]shit make another bread apology I haven't had any bread okay uh eight ounces of olive oil 0.8 ounces of yeast looks good eight of salt looks good 32 of sugar
[138:32.02]Whoa, one?
[138:33.31]Oh, okay.
[138:34.27]Man, that's so wrong.
[138:39.81]How would you suck it out with a vacuum?
[138:47.32]Imagine taking, like, a nozzle and just... Yeah, I took out enough sugar.
[138:51.28]We're good.
[138:54.70]Okay.
[138:55.96]Go.
[139:00.71]Just scrape it off.
[139:01.73]Scrape it out.
[139:12.08]Go back to Morrowind?
[139:18.20]Can you talk about- No.
[139:19.30]Alright.
[139:19.80]The whole thing is not to start arguments in chat.
[139:21.80]The whole point is to just tell you how I feel.
[139:35.37]You started it.
[139:36.35]I know.
[139:36.85]It's my... I know.
[139:37.77]I started it.
[139:38.21]I did.
[139:49.78]You didn't say anything, though.
[139:52.08]Yeah, you know what?
[139:52.82]Fuck that.
[139:53.24]I didn't say anything.
[139:54.96]I agree with that guy.
[140:03.52]That was bad.
[140:13.49]How do I feel about lizards?
[140:14.39]I love lizards.
[140:18.25]I never got exposed to them, really, or experienced them at all, because they're not really on the east coast where I lived.
[140:24.76]There's not very many lizards running around Massachusetts.
[140:29.98]I mean, there are some, but not like there are out here.
[140:33.88]They're everywhere out here.
[140:42.45]Oh, come on.
[140:51.74]Alright, this is the last delivery and then I'm going to play... Should I play that Choose Your Own Adventure thing that Kyle's famous?
[140:58.65]Is that any good?
[141:00.69]I wanted to play it.
[141:12.14]I heard it's good.
[141:12.98]I'll try it.
[141:16.36]I can't even upgrade this stuff.
[141:17.54]When do I get to upgrade?
[141:23.25]Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[141:26.40]Kyla's Famous had two votes in pre-stream chat.
[141:29.78]Yeah, but I mean, it still seems like a fun game.
[141:54.69]Alright, let's go.
[141:57.85]Five Nights at Freddy's 2?
[141:59.83]You don't actually want me to do that.
[142:03.77]Do you actually want me to play five- Alright, mods, do a poll.
[142:11.79]This has to have 80% yeses or I'm not doing it.
[142:17.64]By the way, this needs 80% yeses and it needs at least 5,000 responses.
[142:42.19]At least 5k responses, at least.
[142:44.57]Oh, come on.
[143:08.72]I can't see where I'm going.
[143:21.64]Alright, we're good.
[143:28.05]Oh my god.
[143:29.85]Where is this?
[143:30.39]I... Oh, it's not across the bridge.
[143:34.76]Okay.
[144:06.01]Did I just drive into a police car?
[144:13.67]Alright, what's it look like?
[144:20.97]Um... You got five dot... Nope, not moving.
[144:24.88]Sorry.
[144:25.56]It needed to be 80%.
[144:26.04]Nope.
[144:26.24]Close.
[144:41.65]Alright, so let's do, um... What else do I got?
[144:44.84]We could do My Time at Portia.
[144:47.76]Portia?
[144:48.54]Portia?
[144:51.24]That's the game that I had open all last stream.
[144:55.92]We could do Kyle is Famous.
[144:58.22]We could do... I got a few things we have.
[145:02.88]Alright, I'm gonna go pee.
[145:03.86]I'll be right back.
[145:04.72]We'll figure it out.
[145:06.05]Get some water.
[145:07.31]I have some here, but I'm not gonna pee.
[145:09.07]I'll probably fix the camera, too.
[145:10.05]It looks like shit.
[145:12.70]Alright, I'll be back.
[145:13.64]Talk amongst yourselves.
[145:15.86]Beerby.
