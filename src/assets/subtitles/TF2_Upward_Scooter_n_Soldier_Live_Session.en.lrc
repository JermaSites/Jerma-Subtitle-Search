[00:05.28]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:07.24]Jerma here with a live Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:12.15]Tonight I'm going to be playing as the squirrel.
[00:16.75]And let's just play.
[00:17.55]There we go.
[00:21.77]Whoa!
[00:23.23]Don't scare me like that, man.
[00:26.50]Don't scare me like that.
[00:30.53]Let me try and get around everybody.
[00:32.35]That's all I want to do.
[00:35.09]You think I'm still in here?
[00:36.73]No, I ran away.
[00:39.27]Probably a sentry right here.
[00:40.55]I would be shocked if there wasn't.
[00:44.50]I would be shocked.
[00:50.32]No, no, no, no, no!
[00:51.32]Don't get stuck in the door!
[00:52.14]Sentry?
[00:54.18]Sentry?
[00:56.49]I don't know, I don't think so.
[00:57.51]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna do it just to be careful.
[01:00.71]No, there isn't.
[01:02.35]Okay.
[01:03.59]Well, don't be spotted, so maybe I can, maybe I can get, like, three scout backstabs here.
[01:09.86]Well, that was a kind of.
[01:11.94]Sort of.
[01:13.52]Uh.
[01:14.64]Sort of.
[01:15.80]I'm gonna go with sort of.
[01:18.12]I'm gonna go with maybe.
[01:20.86]What is this guy doing?
[01:23.41]Uh-oh, we got a fight.
[01:24.47]We got a melee fight.
[01:25.40]Who's gonna win the melee fight?
[01:26.72]Soldier or spy?
[01:28.62]Soldier wins the fight.
[01:31.80]Oh!
[01:33.32]I turned right into that.
[01:35.30]I was too busy paying attention to the fucking pay-per-view soldier versus spy match.
[01:41.33]It only cost me like 60 bucks pay-per-view to see that.
[01:44.99]Was it worth it?
[01:45.53]I bet your ass it was.
[01:49.15]Move on.
[01:51.91]You thought you were a spy, but you weren't.
[01:55.89]Oh, drink it!
[02:01.11]That's a great screen.
[02:03.17]Huh?
[02:05.57]We're gonna win.
[02:07.05]I think.
[02:09.22]Ladies and gentlemen, we have won the game.
[02:13.02]Not yet.
[02:13.92]Almost.
[02:14.66]Yes.
[02:15.84]Yes.
[02:17.40]Yes.
[02:19.28]Here comes your scramble!
[02:22.35]Hmm, you know, I guess are you guys all real you're all real Then fine It's alright.
[02:30.32]We're just gonna play on the red team at your Red Scout on your red team Sniper is trying to shoot me Don't shoot me Time to be a creep and creep up behind this sniper.
[02:45.13]Oh
[02:46.90]Alright, I'll just... Alright, I'll walk in his face.
[02:48.84]That works, too.
[02:50.20]And this scout?
[02:50.84]You think you can beat a red scout on a red team?
[02:57.57]You get away.
[03:01.01]Everybody, I made it out alive.
[03:02.89]Fucking mini sentry almost kills me!
[03:08.27]Whew!
[03:10.15]No, no, no, no, no.
[03:12.89]Yeah, I did it!
[03:13.27]I did it!
[03:17.11]Where is he?
[03:19.23]God, I don't know how I'm staying alive like this.
[03:21.81]I can't really go head on here.
[03:29.76]I can't really do much.
[03:30.78]I have to wait until they move.
[03:33.32]Or I could just go right at them.
[03:34.94]There we go.
[03:38.61]Now I get an overheal.
[03:39.31]Now I'm not as scared as I just was.
[03:48.04]What?
[03:48.76]Oh.
[03:50.14]Okay.
[03:52.09]Alright.
[03:53.69]Okay.
[03:57.87]Son of a bitch.
[04:00.05]Thought I had that guy.
[04:02.41]But I didn't.
[04:05.10]Move away.
[04:08.94]Alrighty.
[04:10.94]Just stopped him here for ten minutes.
[04:13.44]Ain't gonna be that long.
[04:21.45]I keep on just barely not getting the last mini sentry again!
[04:24.65]Please don't kill me!
[04:26.23]One... Okay.
[04:34.96]Alright, we'll just respawn.
[04:39.08]We'll do it all over again.
[04:42.62]And we'll just spawn right now.
[04:43.92]And I'll come out with my delicious soda.
[04:50.17]I'm not gonna drink it.
[04:51.33]I want to save it, because I'm going to a movie later, and I want to have a soda for the movie.
[04:56.17]But you can't bring, like, sodas into the movie.
[04:58.27]Otherwise, they get, like, mad at you.
[04:59.63]Alright, well, it doesn't matter.
[05:03.26]I'm not having a soda for the fucking movie.
[05:08.20]Hey.
[05:09.14]Hi, entire team.
[05:10.02]Don't, like, turn around.
[05:10.94]That guy's chasing me.
[05:14.96]Oh, yep.
[05:15.38]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[05:17.65]That's a spy.
[05:18.53]I just see a heart.
[05:19.31]He's using the, uh, the latarenga.
[05:22.05]Yep.
[05:22.51]Yep.
[05:24.11]Yep.
[05:26.31]Yep.
[05:30.25]Come here.
[05:31.85]Come here.
[05:33.86]Come here, you're in big trouble.
[05:37.64]Okay.
[05:38.68]We're safe.
[05:40.77]Now I can get behind everybody.
[05:42.45]Because they are going to spawn right here.
[05:44.00]Please don't open.
[05:44.70]Please don't.
[05:45.18]I knew it was going to open right when I walked by it.
[05:47.84]Another fucking mini-century.
[05:52.38]Seriously, get away from me.
[05:55.18]I had full health.
[05:56.78]And now it's all gone.
[05:57.76]And I'm dead again.
[06:02.18]By you guessed it.
[06:04.16]A mini-century.
[06:07.06]Oh, no, no, no.
[06:10.61]Okay.
[06:11.45]Alright.
[06:11.75]Alright, we're making the switch.
[06:14.72]We're gonna close this round out as a soldier.
[06:17.82]We're doing direct hit soldier to close this out.
[06:21.62]We're gonna go direct.
[06:23.82]And we're just gonna try to smoke some people.
[06:30.29]Do we have any medics?
[06:31.25]I don't know.
[06:32.05]I'm too busy.
[06:33.27]I'm too busy trying to figure out if we have any medics.
[06:38.19]Oh, that's a lot of stuff.
[06:39.22]That's a lot of things coming over.
[06:41.70]The one crit that I get does not hit anybody.
[06:46.82]I'm okay, though.
[06:49.30]He went down here.
[06:50.50]Shotgun.
[06:50.96]Don't want to shoot myself.
[06:52.87]You can't have that much health.
[06:54.17]I knew it.
[06:54.51]Yeah, I was going to say.
[06:55.27]If you had more than 40 or 50 HP or something, I would have been very, very not happy about that.
[07:02.49]Let me just do my favorite germ.
[07:03.89]Just walk over pipes and get hurt yourself.
[07:06.93]That's great.
[07:10.33]We're going to go down here.
[07:13.24]Uh...
[07:17.15]You want to do shotgun fight?
[07:19.15]What, you want to do... Somebody got him.
[07:24.37]Oh no, a hat!
[07:25.61]Jesus!
[07:26.07]I was looking at the hat.
[07:31.17]I should have been paying attention to something else besides the hat that fell on the ground.
[07:35.76]But it was a mystery.
[07:36.52]I needed to know what the mystery was.
[07:40.24]And I still don't know.
[07:41.40]What was it, like a green gibbous?
[07:44.55]It's like a lime green gibbous.
[07:47.07]That is a mystery.
[07:48.15]Hey!
[07:53.67]Hey!
[07:55.63]Where are those mini-sentries?
[07:57.49]I'll take you out in one shot.
[08:00.27]Where are you?
[08:02.19]Where are those mini-sentries?
[08:11.47]Oh!
[08:13.55]Medic!
[08:18.16]Thank you very much.
[08:19.62]You are a... What was that?
[08:22.64]Okay, you're real.
[08:23.39]I heard a stab noise.
[08:27.45]Are you real?
[08:28.47]Am I doing this for no reason?
[08:31.19]I feel like I'm... Yeah, I'm just doing that for no reason at all.
[08:34.41]But this is a Crit's Krieg.
[08:37.07]And I really don't want to waste this.
[08:39.59]So, let's hope.
[08:42.63]I don't waste it.
[08:43.47]Oh, he might give it to this guy.
[08:44.83]Which is equally okay.
[08:47.45]Oh!
[08:50.01]Oh!
[08:53.51]Hey, guys.
[08:54.27]Hmm.
[09:04.32]As long as I can get this guy.
[09:09.26]All right.
[09:11.36]Don't want to get hit from BEHIND!
[09:13.04]That's that.
[09:20.41]Do I have any shots left?
[09:21.63]No, I don't.
[09:25.13]Spy?
[09:25.57]No!
[09:26.07]Scout?
[09:28.26]Do noooooooot!
[09:31.06]No, you don't.
[09:32.06]That's that guy down.
[09:37.50]What else we got?
[09:38.70]We're gonna win.
[09:40.13]Just don't let them do a final push.
[09:42.99]And we'll be good to go.
[09:43.89]I don't want to get sniped either.
[09:48.59]If I get sniped, I'm gonna scream.
[09:55.98]Speaking of screaming... Where's that health pack?
[09:59.64]Spawn, damn you!
[10:02.32]I am out of everything.
[10:05.22]Let's go back to spawn.
[10:06.66]No, I'll let you build your... I still want ammo, though, but I'll let you build it.
[10:11.43]Here we go.
[10:12.95]Last 60 seconds of defense.
[10:18.57]Make it count, gentlemen.
[10:21.85]Make it count.
[10:26.45]In my case, I didn't miss everything.
[10:28.02]When I say make it count, I mean miss every shot.
[10:32.42]This guy's got a crit screen, which I'm not... Damn.
[10:40.08]There's one guy up there.
[10:44.54]What's going on up here?
[10:45.30]What's going on up here?
[10:47.26]Oh, give me that.
[10:47.84]I'm going to do shotgun crits.
[10:51.20]I'm going to do those shotgun crits for the final run.
[10:56.72]Shotgun crits for the final run.
[10:59.94]Come on, we have, like, fuck, a few seconds.
[11:01.36]Where'd he go?
[11:01.90]Oh, he's gone.
[11:02.34]Let's go.
[11:06.56]Somebody on it.
