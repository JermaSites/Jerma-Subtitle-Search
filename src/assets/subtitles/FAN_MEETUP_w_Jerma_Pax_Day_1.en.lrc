[01:00.30]But yes, we just had some food.
[01:01.88]We're not gonna head back to the convention.
[01:05.04]We need to find dress shoes and some proper jeans for the Twitch party later today because apparently they got like fancy, they're going fancy on us.
[01:15.37]So apparently these shoes, not sure if you can see them, but these shoes were apparently not cutting.

[03:21.41]You know, let's do this.
[03:23.57]Let's do this.
[03:25.45]Whoever can do the most push-ups will get this mouse.
