[ve:61.1.100]

[00:26.27]Hey.
[00:30.40]Hey.
[00:33.00]Hey, what's up?
[00:33.92]How are you?
[00:37.79]How's it going?
[00:42.54]We'll get a stream today.
[00:43.58]We'll do a stream today.
[00:45.34]Why not?
[00:49.26]Now, two weeks ago, when I was last live, I said that the next time the stream was going to be live, Oblivion was going to be what you were going to see.
[00:59.13]And the lie detector test determined that to be a lie.
[01:03.61]So... We're playing this Switch NES World Championship Edition, because I've been wanting to for a while.
[01:13.68]But it's okay.
[01:15.16]All you Oblivion fans, let me just tell you
[01:21.28]This weekend.
[01:24.13]Saturday and Sunday.
[01:27.19]It's something I'm calling Oblivion Weekend.
[01:31.00]I'm gonna play it all weekend.
[01:32.52]Pretty much all through the holiday weekend.
[01:40.03]That's not a lie.
[01:40.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[01:41.33]That is not a lie.
[01:42.23]That one is a true statement.
[01:46.12]You said that before?
[01:49.23]Well, the lie detector determined that, uh, that was a true statement.
[01:54.00]Uh, let's play some ads.
[01:55.26]Get the pre-rolls turned off.
[01:57.48]Let's hope they start.
[01:58.52]They should start right now.
[02:00.38]And then we can come and hang out, and I'll be back, and we can play some Super Mario.
[02:06.29]I won't believe it.
[02:08.15]Well, it's alright.
[02:10.46]I prefer it that way.
[02:11.96]Don't believe it until it happens on Saturday.
[02:15.28]And then when it doesn't happen, then you can still think I'm a fucking idiot, so it's alright.
[02:24.26]I believe every word you say.
[02:27.41]Um, I don't think you should.
[02:29.23]I think, I think you shouldn't do that.
[02:33.85]Hey, do something.
[02:36.04]I just turned on the stream.
[02:41.86]Do you go to the movies and then at the previews, you just start screaming at the screen?
[02:46.11]Where's the fucking movie?
[02:48.17]Where's the movie?
[02:50.71]GIVE ME THE MOVIE!
[02:52.07]Is that- and by the way, is that, uh, compressor fucking me up?
[03:00.37]Did that just, uh, mess up my voice?
[03:04.34]No?
[03:04.60]Okay.
[03:05.78]Good.
[03:07.74]That's reasonable?
[03:09.64]No, what's reasonable is you know the previews are gonna be there, so you just- if the movie is at 6 o'clock, you show up at 6.15.
[03:22.04]You don't show up at 6 and then sit there and complain about the previews.
[03:31.50]You don't know they're going to be 15 minutes long?
[03:35.92]I like the previews.
[03:37.09]I treat the previews as if I'm watching the movies.
[03:40.25]Because I know I'm not going to watch any of the movies in the previews usually.
[03:43.16]So it's actually kind of nice.
[03:44.76]Because you kind of get to watch like 7 movies in a row.
[03:47.84]And then you get to watch the one you actually want to watch.
[03:50.88]So it's like, okay, I'm not going to see that one, but I kind of just saw the whole movie.
[03:53.88]Not going to go see that one, but I just saw the whole movie.
[03:59.67]If you're guaranteed to not go see any of these, then okay, that's pretty cool.
[04:07.22]You would prefer the movie ads.
[04:08.50]I didn't say I prefer the movie ads over the movie.
[04:10.92]I just said, stop taking my words and switching them around.
[04:22.62]Okay, you know how in, um, like on shows like Mari, when we just talked about the lie detector thing?
[04:28.43]When all the audience, every time something happens, it's like, It'd be awesome if Mari stood up after that and was like, Ladies and gentlemen, the lie detector you're all connected to has determined that that reaction was a lie.
[04:43.39]Like, oh shit, yeah, I actually didn't mean that.
[04:50.70]I was just doing it to, like, play it up.
[04:52.31]He fucking got us.
[04:58.99]Name five cereals.
[05:01.81]Uh, Cocoa Pebbles.
[05:02.74]Cocoa Puffs.
[05:04.14]Uh, Fruity Pebbles.
[05:05.22]Captain Crunch.
[05:05.92]Captain Crunch Peanut Butter.
[05:06.74]Are you f- That's the easiest thing you've ever had me do.
[05:10.06]Are you kidding me?
[05:14.57]I could probably name 50.
[05:16.75]And no, I'm not going to do it.
[05:23.19]That's not what it's called.
[05:24.17]It's not called Captain Crunch Peanut Butter.
[05:26.15]It's called Captain Crunch's Peanut Butter Crunch.
[05:29.05]Okay?
[05:29.98]That's what it's called.
[05:38.03]Honey Bunches Votes, Raisin Bran.
[05:39.87]Raisin Bran Crunch.
[05:44.49]Where are the ads?
[05:46.46]Where are the fucking ads?
[05:51.07]Hey, off to a good start.
[05:52.55]Hey!
[05:53.03]Alright, I'll be back in three minutes.
[07:34.69]Although I just sat back down for a second.
[07:36.40]People saying there are no ads.
[07:37.96]Is there a run?
[07:38.72]Whatever.
[07:50.92]Because they're subbed.
[07:53.11]Oh, well, that would make sense.
[08:01.14]We all have Prime, we're subbed.
[08:03.66]We stay loyal.
[08:11.01]We stay loyal.
[08:16.22]Hey.
[08:18.38]If you're not subbed, it doesn't mean you're not loyal.
[08:26.25]You could be a loyal viewer and not be subscribed.
[08:28.61]That's fine.
[08:39.34]Yeah, I mean, you could be a non-sub and watch the same, you know, like, nine chewing gum ads in a row, right?
[08:48.73]I don't even know what the fuck they even play anymore.
[08:55.32]Hey, welcome back, everybody.
[09:03.01]We are good to get started.
[09:06.93]I am ready, and I am so pumped for what I'm about to do.
[09:14.40]We've got Nintendo World Championships NES Edition.
[09:20.55]This is a game where you have to go really fast.
[09:23.52]And I have opened it.
[09:26.28]I haven't done any of them yet.
[09:28.04]Well, that's a lie.
[09:28.72]Oh shit, the lie detector determined that was a lie.
[09:31.81]I've done one of them on another account.
[09:34.61]I've done two of them on another account.
[09:37.78]But I only did them once, and I just wanted to see what it... I just wanted to see what it smelt like, okay?
[09:46.09]When do the lies end?
[09:48.15]They never end.
[09:49.89]Alright, you got to go fast.
[09:51.11]It's a speedrunning game.
[09:51.97]It seemed like fun.
[09:53.37]Also, I want to say this, too.
[09:56.88]The House Flipper 3rd Invitational Series is officially being done on June 7th.
[10:04.14]So, not last week.
[10:07.95]Had to be moved.
[10:09.34]June 7th at 12 p.m.
[10:11.26]Pacific.
[10:12.26]There's your new House Flipper date.
[10:15.83]And that is pretty set in stone.
[10:22.50]It's two days after your birthday?
[10:25.00]Nice!
[10:27.59]Alright, you ready to go?
[10:30.91]So see, speedrun mode.
[10:32.33]I didn't do anything.
[10:35.17]Okay, do you got... wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:38.82]Oops.
[10:40.38]What does that mean in the bottom right?
[10:42.20]I have until the 26th to do this?
[10:47.43]Okay, here we go.
[10:48.21]So this is Super Mario Brothers NES stuff.
[10:50.97]So this is called Mush Zoom.
[10:56.14]Okay.
[10:57.44]Look at how difficult this is going to be.
[11:00.21]The task here is to get the mushroom.
[11:04.35]faster than anybody else in the United States of America, at least.
[11:09.63]That might seem easy to you, but this shit's gonna... I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be the fastest time in America.
[11:22.19]Why am I running so slow?
[11:24.53]Wait, B is dash?
[11:26.73]I gotta change that.
[11:28.83]I gotta change this.
[11:29.35]This is horrible controls.
[11:32.63]Alright, how does that get a B plus?
[11:34.94]Somebody explain how that's a B plus.
[11:36.48]Nintendo, that's a very bad time.
[11:38.86]That's not a B plus.
[11:40.28]That was like a C minus.
[11:41.87]That was like an F. If that takes you more than 10 seconds, that's... That's... Okay.
[11:47.59]These controls are bad.
[11:48.77]B... No, it should be Y. Don't even...
[11:57.42]Wait, what happened on the right?
[11:58.30]Oh, that's my... Oh, yeah, baby!
[12:01.63]I just beat my personal best time.
[12:05.91]I just got an A rank.
[12:08.82]Are you drunk?
[12:10.10]No, I... How do I... Can I change the controls?
[12:16.37]Alright, so that one on the right is my PB.
[12:20.62]He's probably drunk.
[12:24.10]You can die?
[12:26.31]Ah, shit.
[12:27.21]Hold on.
[12:34.84]Shit, don't jump early.
[12:36.07]No, no, no.
[12:36.41]Go back, go back, go back.
[12:39.07]I have to beat the guy on the right.
[12:40.57]Can I change the controls?
[12:41.44]Go back.
[12:44.60]Current challenges.
[12:45.54]I love this game.
[12:49.79]Oh, that's my hype tag.
[12:51.27]What do you think?
[12:53.23]Expert Button Masher, I think that's accurate.
[12:55.25]And my favorite NES game, Snake Rattle and Roll.
[13:05.93]I think I'm gonna use the different controllers for this because I'm using the pro controller.
[13:09.76]I think, should I just use the other one?
[13:12.02]I don't like that B is dash, it should be Y.
[13:23.52]That's too bad.
[13:27.56]I don't like that.
[13:30.60]You can map it in the switch system settings.
[13:32.33]Are you kidding me?
[13:33.47]How do I do that?
[13:34.31]Oops.
[13:37.77]System settings.
[13:42.12]Where is it?
[13:47.54]Rental controls.
[13:48.74]Controls.
[13:49.36]Okay.
[13:49.54]Change button mapping.
[13:50.32]There it is.
[13:51.28]I know you can't see.
[13:51.96]I don't care.
[13:53.34]That sounded really mean, but whatever.
[13:56.10]Okay, so I want... What do I want this to be?
[14:03.19]So I want B to be jump.
[14:07.20]So I want B to be A. No, no, no.
[14:11.56]Change.
[14:11.92]Yes.
[14:12.95]I want B to be A.
[14:19.15]And I want... Wait.
[14:20.76]Fuck.
[14:21.16]Hold on.
[14:21.44]I can't... This is like a puzzle game.
[14:23.60]I want B. When I press B, it's A. Because that's jump.
[14:29.31]And I want... No.
[14:33.60]Why can I not do this?
[14:36.54]A right now is jump.
[14:38.67]I want A to be B.
[14:46.17]Why?
[14:46.83]Don't list it like this.
[14:48.03]That's confusing the fuck out of me.
[14:49.60]A is greater than B. Okay, so A is B. Y is B. Right?
[15:00.59]Because that's correct.
[15:01.19]But I want Y to be dash and I want B to be jump.
[15:09.54]Y is B. B is A. Right?
[15:13.72]You want Y to be B.
[15:16.95]Isn't that what it is?
[15:19.85]Yeah, Y is B. B is A. And then, who gives a shit about what this is?
[15:26.68]Make A Y. No, I got it.
[15:29.63]I got it, I got it.
[15:39.92]Oh, fuck, the whole thing changed.
[15:42.94]Oh, wait, hold on.
[15:44.28]B is now A, A is now B.
[15:47.28]Okay.
[15:49.00]See if that fixes it.
[15:56.71]Yep.
[16:01.50]Oh yeah.
[16:03.96]Alright, I gotta make it so I don't- I gotta dash faster.
[16:06.37]How do you do this fast?
[16:19.98]That's gonna be top of the... I can't even make the joke.
[16:32.32]Shit!
[16:37.22]You gotta get it on the jump, right?
[16:45.42]Just... how do I end it?
[16:49.48]You're gonna forget you remapped the buttons?
[16:56.18]No, I'm not.
[17:04.53]Fuck, how did he go so much faster than me?
[17:07.82]How do you get- how do you do this?
[17:15.00]How is that faster?
[17:23.78]How did he go so much faster than me?
[17:25.37]I gotta watch him.
[17:26.27]I gotta watch what I did earlier.
[17:34.68]Fuck.
[17:35.46]I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be here all day.
[17:40.17]Don't hit the Goomba?
[17:44.31]I thought I had to go over the Goomba.
[17:46.39]Like that.
[17:49.30]Am I gonna get faster than four and a half seconds?
[17:56.64]Fuck.
[18:07.27]It's a short hop.
[18:10.70]I just did a short hop.
[18:12.28]I can't get it.
[18:12.80]I can't do it.
[18:15.52]Let me see what I did earlier.
[18:20.43]That should have hit it.
[18:22.75]It's a press.
[18:23.53]I just did a little half press.
[18:26.63]Big bounce off the Goomba?
[18:28.17]I gotta learn- I gotta get that down then.
[18:32.09]Oh, fuck you.
[18:36.78]Alright, I'll come back to this.
[18:37.50]I'll come back to it.
[18:38.34]That was- that was- that was way too hard.
[18:40.81]Alright, this is called Don't Go Alone.
[18:42.85]This is for The Legend of Zelda.
[18:45.33]This is a one-star difficulty.
[18:47.40]This, uh, this one is guaranteed to give you diarrhea if you go here.
[18:51.90]Guaranteed.
[18:52.49]100% guaranteed.
[18:56.90]Wait, you just have to walk in the door.
[18:59.69]This should be easy.
[19:13.35]What?
[19:13.61]How did I do so bad?
[19:14.95]No.
[19:19.16]Hold on.
[19:25.30]This is hard.
[19:26.76]It's not hard.
[19:32.63]I didn't do that on purpose, and people are going to think I did.
[19:35.17]We have to do a lie detector.
[19:40.38]There we go.
[19:53.36]That's pretty good.
[19:56.17]What's the highest you can get?
[19:57.31]How can you go faster than that?
[20:02.36]And you can do S how?
[20:17.30]Double plus A is good?
[20:20.48]That was pretty frame perfect, I'm not gonna lie.
[20:29.93]Okay, what's next?
[20:32.84]Wait, this one's... I got coins.
[20:35.28]This one's 10 coins.
[20:36.24]This is for... Alright, collect all the coins in Mario Brothers.
[20:43.98]So is that what I'm supposed to emulate right there?
[20:45.76]They're kind of giving the spoilers, aren't they?
[20:58.62]Gotta get a ground level.
[20:59.78]Gotta get a ground level.
[21:02.61]Okay.
[21:11.86]Gotta get a ground level.
[21:18.25]Whoa.
[21:19.19]Two and a half.
[21:19.73]2.8 seconds.
[21:20.85]I can go faster than that.
[21:27.46]2.78.
[21:27.90]I can do better.
[21:29.58]2.78?
[21:37.77]Exact same as the last one?
[21:49.52]One more.
[21:51.69]Dude, he's not even human.
[21:56.37]Shit.
[21:57.27]There's so much time save I can do here.
[22:03.98]What is S plus?
[22:04.70]5?
[22:05.80]2.5?
[22:06.06]Oh.
[22:20.30]You gotta clap every PB.
[22:26.39]I can definitely do 2.5.
[22:27.41]There's no way I can't.
[22:29.19]There's no way I can't.
[22:29.91]Wait, what?
[22:35.46]Alright, one more, one more, one more, one more.
[22:37.60]Last one.
[22:42.05]One more.
[22:42.31]Last one after this.
[22:49.98]Last one.
[22:59.24]I thought I could just keep going and beat the level and have like 10 minutes.
[23:02.77]Whatever.
[23:03.49]I'll take 2.51.
[23:07.61]This Donkey Kong?
[23:08.61]Okay, wait.
[23:09.07]Let's do Donkey Kong.
[23:10.34]Bottom rung?
[23:13.24]Climb a ladder.
[23:19.15]Isn't this... Wouldn't everybody get the same time doing this?
[23:27.42]How do you do this faster than anybody else?
[23:34.85]Okay.
[23:47.51]Wait, does this technically count as a ladder?
[23:49.83]No.
[23:59.27]What are you trying to achieve?
[24:07.35]It's great that my first and maybe only S in the game so far and in the future is the... It's walk up a ladder.
[24:17.45]Can I do that faster?
[24:18.21]4.83.
[24:27.97]Can you even do this faster than that?
[24:39.80]I don't think this is physically possible.
[24:46.31]Can you pause, buffer, and cheat?
[24:51.50]Oh, you can't, no.
[24:54.92]Okay, I screwed it up.
[24:58.23]Jump before getting on the ladder.
[25:07.21]That didn't work.
[25:11.61]Okay, well, I got it.
[25:14.06]What's that for this one, then?
[25:16.80]Hammer Hustle.
[25:18.68]Get a hammer.
[25:20.05]Okay, they're making it a little harder now.
[25:23.19]Let's watch and see what the PC does.
[25:30.94]Alright, just get the hammer.
[25:32.34]I got this.
[25:38.74]We nailed this down.
[25:39.57]We got this down completely.
[25:40.63]Look at that.
[25:41.03]4.8 seconds.
[25:41.51]Good.
[25:42.67]Good.
[25:42.87]It's alright.
[25:43.45]I can save time in a second here.
[25:47.02]Big time save.
[25:47.80]Big time save.
[25:48.34]Got it.
[25:53.15]I can do better than that.
[25:57.45]Thank God.
[25:57.97]Yeah, luckily there's the yellow circle.
[26:02.34]What the hell?
[26:11.07]Wait, what?
[26:14.45]Did I not jump?
[26:28.11]No!
[26:29.67]You have to jump!
[26:35.80]You have to jump and land.
[26:38.20]I almost got killed by a fire.
[26:49.79]What the hell?
[27:07.29]Get up there, you fucking idiot!
[27:09.81]I can do so much better than that.
[27:15.72]You have to be pixel perfect, so you have to jump and land from far away.
[27:20.11]Okay.
[27:22.64]Good first letter.
[27:28.47]Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
[27:31.50]Exactly what I needed to do.
[27:32.80]Pixel perfect on the left edge.
[27:35.77]Can I run that back?
[27:36.77]I want to see that again.
[27:42.98]I don't even want to do it.
[27:43.62]I just want to watch the one on the right.
[27:45.98]Check this out.
[27:48.48]Immediate ladder grab bang.
[27:51.91]I could save a little time there.
[27:54.33]Immediate bang.
[27:55.67]Jump.
[27:56.75]Right on that edge.
[27:57.27]10.91.
[28:06.16]What's the lowest time you get the actual rating you can get?
[28:10.41]Get out of the way.
[28:19.24]32 seconds is a C. Can you even fail?
[28:23.68]Alright, we're on Donkey Kong.
[28:25.99]50 coins for this hard.
[28:27.11]Okay, this one's hard.
[28:31.29]Reach Pauline.
[28:33.44]Oh, that's the warm-up.
[28:36.49]That's the warm-up.
[28:39.06]Okay.
[28:40.60]I'm actually pretty good at this.
[28:42.29]I don't need a tutorial.
[28:44.88]I'm gonna annihilate this first try.
[28:49.67]And that's what you call a first try S. I could have saved a little time on that last ladder.
[29:18.91]Strat again.
[29:20.82]Yeah, the hammer's bait.
[29:21.58]Don't even go for it.
[29:32.01]Ah!
[29:32.45]Ah!
[29:33.89]Nah.
[29:34.71]Nah, I lost time there.
[29:36.08]It's over.
[29:43.05]The whole run screwed up.
[29:46.54]Alright, one more try.
[29:58.71]Do ZL and... ZL and ZR.
[30:09.04]Okay.
[30:12.86]Wait.
[30:14.40]Is that a reset?
[30:15.21]Or is that...
[30:18.55]It kind of quits out.
[30:27.06]Get up there.
[30:27.56]I hate when the last pixel doesn't get up there.
[30:33.03]This actually might be better.
[30:33.87]Oh, that could have been so much better.
[30:42.02]Look at how much time I could have saved.
[30:43.30]I can do 21.
[30:43.64]I can do 20 seconds.
[30:48.69]GET OFF THE FUCKING LADDER!
[31:06.23]What the hell?
[31:11.20]What the hell was that?
[31:13.38]I was holding up, but he didn't do anything.
[31:18.46]Get off the fucking ladder!
[31:26.19]Why does it not do it sometimes?
[31:27.83]The computers, the control is broken.
[31:39.81]Raging an OG Donkey Kong?
[31:45.13]I'm not raging, I'm just expressing emotion.
[31:50.47]How is that lower?
[32:04.47]He's really sensitive.
[32:07.52]I'm still getting cut off by my compressor, even though it's much better than before.
[32:10.31]Okay, good to know.
[32:11.67]I can fix it.
[32:16.47]Alright, let's get out of there.
[32:34.53]Look, I'm a Donkey Kong player.
[32:37.25]Let's keep it rolling.
[32:39.13]Lost and found.
[32:41.60]Collect the parasol and purse.
[32:46.39]I don't even want to see it.
[32:48.11]Yeah, I do.
[32:48.97]No, I don't.
[32:53.90]That was a good frame grab.
[32:55.38]Perfect frame grabs.
[32:58.19]A little slow.
[32:59.03]Eh?
[32:59.49]Eh?
[33:00.91]Eh?
[33:01.05]I didn't know where the hitbox was.
[33:02.15]Okay.
[33:14.55]...
[33:16.53]I was trying to hit that perfect timing.
[33:31.25]The fuck are you doing?
[33:34.73]Oh, I need both.
[33:35.31]Oops.
[33:39.76]Okay, I can do that way better.
[33:43.40]Is the bush hittin' punk?
[33:50.57]I read that so weirdly.
[33:51.77]I can do better than that.
[34:09.45]That RNG sucks!
[34:10.51]Get out of here!
[34:15.09]It's literally an NES game, bro.
[34:46.20]Calm down.
[34:51.51]Yeah, do you understand that this used to be Skyrim?
[34:56.08]This was Skyrim back in the day.
[35:04.37]Take this really seriously.
[35:06.79]Nothing else existed that was cooler than this.
[35:08.66]20, 30 years ago, guys.
[35:11.16]Or 35 years ago, more than that.
[35:12.38]Fuck.
[35:17.05]This came out, and this was the coolest thing that has ever existed.
[35:21.14]There wasn't, oh, this is just some game that is an old game that's like a retro game.
[35:34.57]No, this was Skyrim.
[35:41.46]You didn't play this to remember how things used to be.
[35:45.72]You were like, man, this is legit.
[35:47.97]Why is, why am I doing wrong?
[35:52.43]Skyrim is a retro game now.
[35:54.20]Yeah, I know.
[36:03.74]Oh, everything that could have happened that was good happened there.
[36:13.13]Something I wanted to talk about, I was laughing about this the other day.
[36:17.19]So... I saw that... Infinity War was on TBS.
[36:28.60]And it had me thinking...
[36:32.21]Like, why would you ever watch a movie like that on TBS, on just regular, on TV?
[36:40.04]Because there was just, there were commercials every, you know, 10 to 15 minutes.
[36:44.39]I don't even know if it was like in high quality.
[36:45.99]It was like in, I don't even know if it was in 4K.
[36:49.47]And it made me think about this too.
[36:51.51]At this point, five, six years later, I feel like everybody has seen Infinity War.
[36:56.72]Why would that be the place where you watch Infinity War?
[37:03.18]That is the worst possible way to watch any movie in 2025.
[37:11.29]Maybe if it's a hotel.
[37:12.37]Okay, but I feel like even a hotel room would have a smart TV that's like... And make sure to check out Infinity War and Endgame on our hotel Wi-Fi.
[37:22.73]Like, I think they have it.
[37:24.37]I actually think they have it on the hotel Wi-Fi.
[37:32.56]And it had me thinking, how many people are actively watching Infinity War on the TBS when it was on?
[37:39.45]I don't know if it was 100 people.
[37:43.01]Do you guys think that Infinity War on TBS at 3 o'clock in the afternoon has more than 100 people watching it concurrently?
[37:54.83]I don't know.
[37:55.65]I'm not sure.
[37:56.39]Probably millions?
[38:02.24]I don't know, is it?
[38:03.84]I feel like, but I would get to it even if I was on, like just scrolling through.
[38:07.47]Doesn't matter what network either.
[38:08.91]Lots of networks do this.
[38:09.65]They've done tons of movies.
[38:10.49]It just happened to me.
[38:11.01]This is where I just, I saw it.
[38:12.07]This is where I saw it.
[38:13.33]This is what brought it up.
[38:15.16]And I'm just sitting there like, okay, I'm going to watch for like a minute.
[38:19.76]And then I'll fucking, something's going to pop up in the corner or something, or it's going to go to an ad and I'm going to leave.
[38:28.35]And ad breaks in the middle of movies might be the worst possible thing you could do.
[38:36.34]Because just like how ads on like YouTube and a lot of times on Twitch too, it kind of just happens.
[38:44.19]There wasn't like a place, a lot of TV shows and sitcoms and old, anything that was made to be syndicated on television.
[38:50.69]There's like these break periods.
[38:52.97]So like Thanos will say something.
[38:55.35]It'll be like, oh, get out of here.
[38:56.65]Oh, look out the Hulk.
[38:59.38]Oh no, he landed.
[39:00.64]And now we're talking about like dish soap.
[39:03.25]It just, it's just, it wasn't like a place for, there wasn't like a time to do an ad break.
[39:11.06]So it's just, it's like the worst way to watch a movie.
[39:19.43]The TBS website says there's an average of 400,000 viewers a day.
[39:27.38]Yeah, but are they not watching that?
[39:29.11]Do you think there's a shitload of people who watched Infinity War on TBS right there?
[39:39.64]I just, think of where every place that Infinity War has been.
[39:43.63]So many, how many people own it on like Apple TV now?
[39:48.23]It was on a bunch of streaming services.
[39:49.92]It's on streaming, it's everywhere.
[39:52.60]If that was my first time watching Infinity War, I'd rather watch it on a plane.
[39:57.09]I think watching Infinity War on a plane would be a better experience.
[40:08.38]And on the topic of movies, I know, I know, I know we're doing this, but on the topic of movies, I've talked about this before, but I'm going to bring it up again.
[40:16.49]How do you... I... I... I'm... We're going to talk about this topic again, I know, and I just said the same sentence twice.
[40:21.64]I don't care.
[40:23.34]How do you guys watch horror movies?
[40:24.74]How?
[40:26.02]How do you watch horror movies?
[40:28.82]Because every time I ever turn a horror movie on, I have... I put it at a tiny volume.
[40:36.48]like dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick down to like 15 percentile because anytime there's something horrible happens somebody's running down this like the street with a chainsaw oh please no don't kill me I just think that people are gonna think that I'm killing somebody in here like that people are gonna think somebody's getting murdered inside the like your apartment or your house
[41:04.12]I don't, like, who wants to... That's, like, weird.
[41:07.02]I don't want to hear anybody hearing that.
[41:15.33]Like, think about the loud screams that I just, even with headphones in.
[41:20.42]What the fuck are you watching over there?
[41:22.82]Like, oh, I'm on an airplane, and I'm just kind of, I'm looking down at my iPad, and nobody can see what I'm looking, but you hear, like...
[41:32.67]And you just have a stone-cold face looking down, neutral.
[41:37.02]When can you watch a horror movie?
[41:39.50]You have to watch a horror movie with a group of like six to ten people.
[41:45.19]Your compressor just ruined it?
[41:46.95]Oh well.
[41:51.10]I don't think you can watch a horror movie.
[41:58.05]Watching a horror movie as one guy, it kind of sucks, because you have to, like, make sure people don't think that you're actually, like, actively attacking somebody.
[42:10.45]Oh, I saw the new Beetlejuice, by the way.
[42:14.49]I hated it.
[42:16.26]I thought it was terrible.
[42:20.32]I'm sorry.
[42:21.12]I'm sorry, I thought it was terrible.
[42:27.75]Beetlejuice is one of my favorite movies of all time.
[42:31.56]Of all time.
[42:33.88]And that movie I thought was F. And I'll tell you why it was F. Because Beetlejuice the character felt like he was doing cameos in his own movie.
[42:45.78]He would just kind of pop up sometimes and be like, Hey, hey, it's me, Beetlejuice.
[42:48.98]It was like he was doing cameos in his own movie.
[42:52.83]I think Beetlejuice was in that movie for like 19 total minutes of like almost two hour runtime.
[43:05.95]I didn't like it at all.
[43:08.77]There were moments where I said, oh, hey, okay, here comes the juice.
[43:13.14]Here comes the juice.
[43:15.06]And then it just, it would be for like 15 seconds.
[43:20.33]He wasn't in the first movie either.
[43:22.54]Yeah, but the scenes that he had in the first movie were like hit just so much harder.
[43:27.70]I didn't like it.
[43:37.39]All the other characters were so goofy he felt relatively normal.
[43:41.44]Yeah, Beetlejuice was kind of the crazy guy in the first movie and like everybody's the crazy guy in the second movie.
[43:48.55]Every single character is a cartoon character.
[43:52.89]It just didn't, it did not work for me.
[43:59.60]Alright, so that, we got everything I wanted to talk about out of the way.
[44:10.83]Oh, Kid Icarus, I've never played this.
[44:12.89]Wait, did I just, did I do more Mario?
[44:14.66]Alright, Mario.
[44:21.84]What if you just ended the stream?
[44:23.06]Ooh!
[44:24.17]I'm gonna be good at this one.
[44:26.97]Get to the goal pole.
[44:42.61]You gotta get a baseline.
[44:43.41]It's gonna be dog shit, but whatever.
[44:48.79]Was that a burp?
[44:50.62]Uh, no, it was my chair was making a sound.
[45:06.90]How the fuck do you do this?
[45:13.19]I came here waiting specifically for Kid Icarus.
[45:19.08]That's it right there.
[45:21.37]I gotta clean it up a little though.
[45:34.19]Don't listen to the haters.
[45:36.21]What do you mean haters?
[45:42.59]Dog shit again.
[45:51.43]You gotta hit one of these and... You gotta hit one of those and jump immediately.
[45:58.22]I'm a hater.
[45:59.52]Well, whatever.
[46:04.09]That was a little bit better.
[46:10.32]Are your haters your motivators?
[46:12.56]No.
[46:16.81]For the same reason why there's probably people that love the Beetlejuice movie.
[46:20.86]Here's the thing.
[46:21.86]I cannot tell you that the Beetleju- I cannot convince you.
[46:25.37]I can't tell you that the Beetlejuice movie was bad.
[46:27.99]If you liked it, that's the way it is.
[46:30.84]I could sit here and go, well, uh, I thought it was dog shit.
[46:36.55]And you can go, I didn't.
[46:37.31]And I'll go, well, uh, fuck you.
[46:39.41]Well, fuck you too.
[46:40.11]Okay, well, fuck you.
[46:41.57]I cannot convince you otherwise.
[46:48.69]Like, if I did a presentation on why I thought Beetlejuice was a bad movie, the people that liked the movie would have left in the first slide.
[46:59.91]Big.
[47:06.88]Why are you so rude today?
[47:07.82]I think that's rude for even asking if I was rude today.
[47:12.45]That's how I feel.
[47:17.50]Oh, I want to talk about this too.
[47:20.70]No, I can't.
[47:21.22]People are gonna think I'm an idiot.
[47:25.28]I'm gonna talk about it because it's stupid and it's... whatever.
[47:28.51]Somebody said, have you seen Skinmerink?
[47:31.23]And... I'll be honest.
[47:33.85]I'll be honest with you.
[47:36.16]That movie was like just hallways of grainy hallways.
[47:40.08]And it maybe was because...
[47:46.54]It is possibly because... Okay.
[47:52.39]Yeah, it ruled.
[47:53.33]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[47:54.65]There was a bunch of weird, creepy fucking things in it.
[47:59.00]But I kind of, like... I have a... When I watch movies and TV shows...
[48:09.00]I, like, need something to happen.
[48:12.04]My attention span is, like, is pretty limited.
[48:14.82]It just is.
[48:15.25]And I know that.
[48:16.71]Some people have way larger attention spans, but mine is not.
[48:21.69]So, the first, like, 40 minutes of that movie, it kind of reminded me of when I was younger and I would just kind of film stuff with my digital camera that I had.
[48:33.99]Just, like, anything.
[48:36.52]It just felt like a bunch of anything film.
[48:40.28]And then something fucking weird started happening, and I was like, whoa, wait a minute, what's this weird shit?
[48:44.55]This is kind of weird.
[48:48.33]And then I stopped watching it.
[48:50.66]So there you go.
[48:58.14]Watch it again with subway surfers?
[48:59.72]No, no, I can sit and watch a movie.
[49:02.43]I can do it.
[49:02.85]I can do it.
[49:05.44]Okay, I won't watch it then.
[49:08.91]Skidamarink is almost all, all Atmosphere.
[49:15.14]Almost the entire movie.
[49:16.06]It is like an hour and 30 minutes of Atmosphere.
[49:19.22]Don't expect a guy like, like, oh my god, it's the guy with the chainsaw.
[49:26.91]That's not what that movie is.
[49:28.19]It's almost only specifically Atmosphere, the whole thing.
[49:37.52]That would have been so fucking perfect and I'm mad that it wasn't.
[49:46.94]You want my tier list of horror movies?
[49:48.36]What I think is the scariest horror movie ever made?
[49:51.60]And I got an answer immediately for you.
[49:54.09]Poltergeist.
[49:55.55]And not even because the movie is scary, just all the... I won't watch it.
[50:00.64]I will not watch Poltergeist.
[50:03.60]Because it's just like the whole movie is fucked up and kind of cursed and...
[50:08.89]I feel like I don't want to watch that movie.
[50:14.48]All the stuff around Poltergeist makes Poltergeist S-plus in horror movies.
[50:20.11]It's just so, so much shit around that movie.
[50:24.49]I've seen it a long time ago, but I've scrolled by it before and gone, oh, Poltergeist.
[50:30.30]No, no, no, no, I don't think so.
[50:33.48]No, too much weird shit happened around that movie.
[50:35.10]Nope.
[50:43.84]You played that level 15 extra times for no reason?
[50:47.39]I was trying to get a better score!
[50:48.55]What do you mean, no reason?
[50:56.30]Alright, hit five blocks.
[51:01.62]That was so slow, I can do so much better than that.
[51:11.33]Damage tech.
[51:12.03]It's all good.
[51:22.23]That would have been S. It would have been under 4.
[51:36.09]That was actually kind of good.
[51:37.11]Hold on.
[51:51.12]Do a crouch jump?
[52:00.22]This is on normal.
[52:00.96]This is even hard.
[52:06.97]I'm surprised that wasn't S. It's got to be under 350.
[52:09.20]Top best movies of all time.
[52:14.37]Three best movies ever made.
[52:15.65]I don't know.
[52:29.51]Gremlins 2 is a... I love that movie for a million reasons.
[52:33.04]But it is not... it is absolutely not one of the best movies of all time.
[52:36.88]It's one of the best movies.
[52:44.67]It's in the top 10 for me.
[52:45.85]Top 5.
[52:49.25]Is it Ernest?
[52:50.63]No.
[52:56.58]Dogshit.
[52:59.50]What the hell even is the best movie I've ever seen?
[53:09.29]I don't know.
[53:24.53]I'd have to really sit down and think about it.
[53:34.15]I don't think it's a movie from the last five to ten years, though.
[53:37.25]I think it's something from a long time ago.
[53:44.50]No Country for Old Men is incredible, but I don't know if that's number one.
[53:53.19]That is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I don't know if that is the best movie.
[53:58.14]It's in the conversation.
[54:06.09]I think Ghostbusters is unironically in that conversation.
[54:18.22]I think it was one of the most interesting, fun, creative, had an all-star cast.
[54:25.89]Jokes landed.
[54:26.69]I think it's got to be up there.
[54:31.29]The concept of the Ghostbusters.
[54:32.46]If you're going to talk about the best concept for a movie ever, it's Ghostbusters, probably.
[54:39.64]I don't know if it's the best movie ever made, but it's one of my favorite concepts.
[54:50.11]Okay.
[54:50.23]Defeat all the enemies.
[54:51.01]You got it.
[55:03.56]Okay.
[55:03.68]First of all, I didn't get what was happening, but we're good.
[55:07.16]Shining is up there too.
[55:13.40]You can probably kill these all in like one hit.
[55:23.90]Shawshank?
[55:24.66]Yeah, Shawshank's up there.
[55:26.64]I got, you know, the thing with these movie conversations is we'll have these, I'll go, I don't know.
[55:32.99]I don't know.
[55:33.53]I don't have to think about it.
[55:36.38]And then at four o'clock in the morning, if four days from now, I'm going to rip out of bed, like don't wake daddy.
[55:42.77]And I'm going to fucking pop my head up.
[55:44.23]I'm going to go, it's a Christmas story.
[55:49.02]And now there's nobody here to tell this to.
[55:58.88]Ah, that would have been good.
[56:11.09]You know what's missing from society?
[56:15.32]Yeah, you want to take?
[56:16.16]You know what's missing from society that would make our society even way better?
[56:19.46]And I think is a massive disservice to everybody.
[56:25.35]Where are all the fucked up board games that I got to grow up with?
[56:31.32]Where's Don't Wake Daddy, Slobberin' Sam?
[56:35.42]We grow up back 20, 30 years ago with just fuckin' weird... ...twisted-ass board games.
[56:44.43]You guys remember, what was the- what was the game called?
[56:46.25]Where you literally... you make these little, like, grape people.
[56:50.52]You make these little people out of Play-Doh.
[56:52.64]And the board game is you walk around with them, and if you land on a certain spot, they die.
[57:00.51]Like, oh yeah, okay, now crush them with the guillotine.
[57:03.33]This was in the game.
[57:05.50]Oh, don't land on that spot.
[57:06.88]The hammer crushes you.
[57:10.77]What was it called?
[57:13.73]Grape escape.
[57:15.01]Yes.
[57:22.42]No wonder you ended up this way.
[57:30.38]Do it again.
[57:33.70]You know, one of my ideas that I wanted to have at some point... This is a few years ago.
[57:39.30]I wanted to do... I wanted to just get, like, 20 of these.
[57:44.67]Old-ass board games that were just weird, bizarre.
[57:50.38]And just get, like, a bunch of streamers and play them all.
[57:56.94]We had some, there was some weird, that was some wild shit.
[58:00.10]Hey, I can do this so much better.
[58:01.17]What am I doing?
[58:09.06]I can do this so much better.
[58:10.24]Why am I so bad at this?
[58:17.51]Oh my god, it's actually pissing me off.
[58:27.08]What the fuck are you doing?
[58:28.12]That was it!
[58:29.76]I'm actually pissed off.
[58:36.35]That's not S. The one on the left first?
[59:04.86]Okay, left, up, right, up.
[59:11.45]You gotta be kidding me.
[59:12.21]That's not S. That's as close as I'm gonna get.
[59:17.28]Left, right, up, up.
[59:25.08]That was so much slower.
[59:37.63]Oh, I panicked.
[59:38.91]I had it.
[59:40.76]Slow down.
[59:41.46]What's wrong with me?
[59:45.84]That's it.
[59:46.22]I have to walk towards it.
[60:01.86]Are you pretending to like Zelda again?
[60:05.27]I gotta get the 2-1-1.
[60:19.71]Nope.
[60:25.14]Holy shit, that's gonna be a world record.
[60:37.07]That's a personal world record.
[60:42.82]Why would I even try that one again?
[60:44.40]Actually, I want to see that again.
[60:52.72]How do you improve that?
[60:56.07]I don't know how you improve this.
[61:08.59]I guess maybe you could get it to, like, two?
[61:13.38]Hey, you need to watch Andor.
[61:16.28]Uh, Andor, and, or what?
[61:21.37]I mean, you didn't say the second thing.
[61:33.51]Am I the first person to do that?
[61:35.64]I hope I am.
[61:36.86]To me, that sounds like I'm the first person to do that.
[61:42.66]Alright, I'll be right back.
[61:45.24]Let's get some ads out of the way.
[61:46.18]I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[61:48.03]BRB.
[66:09.08]Hello.
[66:12.73]Okay.
[66:13.99]I got S on all the Donkey Kongs.
[66:18.74]Let's go for more Mario.
[66:29.17]Run for your money.
[66:32.82]Easy.
[66:33.66]S first try.
[66:34.28]Watch it.
[66:42.83]There was a little bump at the beginning there.
[66:55.35]Wait, what if I do this?
[67:03.08]That might be faster if I get it.
[67:10.58]Ahhhh.
[67:15.65]Falling down is faster, okay.
[67:23.16]So how do I get this perfect?
[67:31.43]Shit.
[67:31.77]355?
[67:41.54]I can get that to 350, right?
[67:48.54]Are you genuinely into astrology?
[67:53.07]Uh, that is quite a Mercury retrograde comment to say today, don't you think?
[68:06.81]That's the one.
[68:09.14]Damn, how do you go faster than that?
[68:19.36]How do you go faster than that?
[68:20.50]340.
[68:27.15]How do I shave any more time?
[68:28.67]I bet you can't even name all the planets.
[68:38.85]Mercury, Mars, Venus.
[68:46.73]That's that one... What's that one with the water and the land on it?
[68:52.29]It's like mostly water.
[68:53.18]Um... Albatross, I think.
[68:58.02]I don't know.
[68:59.14]Oh, Earth!
[68:59.58]Earth!
[68:59.78]Earth!
[69:00.00]Sorry.
[69:20.33]How do you do this faster than 3.4 seconds?
[69:23.71]Any gamers here?
[69:34.87]Oh, I know what I get.
[69:35.45]You gotta get the mushroom.
[69:36.77]Crouch jump.
[69:37.79]Oh, wait.
[69:38.05]It doesn't want me to do that.
[69:40.21]It's pissed that I keep getting it.
[69:44.06]Is Pluto a planet?
[69:47.80]Um...
[69:49.08]Pluto... Is... Like, we're making all this shit up anyways.
[70:03.02]We don't know what this stuff is.
[70:08.32]Planet!
[70:09.52]That's what we made the word up.
[70:12.01]Planet.
[70:14.73]We don't know what the fuck that is.
[70:15.77]What is that?
[70:16.59]What's a planet?
[70:17.71]We just made it up.
[70:24.18]Shit.
[70:31.19]What?
[70:31.57]It's called science.
[70:38.96]Yeah, and they used to smoke cigarettes.
[70:40.56]40, 50 years ago, and they thought it was like a health food.
[70:44.23]Okay?
[70:46.67]Talk to me in a thousand years, and then I'll tell you what a planet is.
[70:59.62]They're gonna find out, it's gonna be like, oh shit, actually.
[71:02.08]Oh, what did they think these were?
[71:04.91]They thought they were floating rocks.
[71:06.75]They didn't know that they were eggs.
[71:09.91]Living eggs.
[71:11.19]That's, wow, they didn't know this.
[71:14.36]I'm surprised they didn't know that.
[71:15.42]Wait, they didn't even get to the center of the Earth?
[71:19.12]Well, they would have known that it was an egg.
[71:21.41]Wow, that's why, that's why.
[71:22.93]Okay, you gotta beat world 1-1.
[71:37.81]I'm fucking around guys, alright?
[71:39.65]Everybody relax.
[71:45.14]You literally are describing what happened with Pluto's classification.
[71:51.74]You know, I used to be so good at 1-1.
[72:11.17]Dude, I just ate an egg.
[72:12.77]What the fuck?
[72:18.82]Dude, you just ate a planet.
[72:21.56]Are you kidding me?
[72:26.25]Alright, at least finish one.
[72:27.25]There's actually an entire philosophy about Earth being an egg of consciousness.
[72:36.58]Yeah, okay, next you're gonna tell me.
[72:38.44]Here's what you're gonna tell me next.
[72:39.79]You're gonna tell me next that just for no reason, for absolutely no reason, there was a gigantic explosion for no reason.
[72:51.00]Why did it happen?
[72:51.86]I don't know.
[72:52.84]It was an explosion.
[72:54.76]What caused the explosion?
[72:56.28]I don't fucking know.
[72:57.10]It was an explosion.
[72:59.53]What's going on here?
[73:13.30]checkmate atheists shit let me finish 1-1 quantum bullshit
[73:40.78]For all we know, we could be the underside of some big alien's shoe.
[73:48.65]And the day that he realizes that there's gum stuck to it, we're fucked.
[73:58.22]I can do way better than that.
[74:07.24]That's an MIB ass theory.
[74:10.27]That was a great ending.
[74:11.37]Oh, I'll put that in the top five, uh, top ten movies of all time.
[74:14.34]That's in the conversation for sure.
[74:21.15]Beautiful, beautiful!
[74:43.94]That was pretty good.
[74:45.62]Ah, I hate- I could never be a speedrunner.
[74:47.64]I'm too fucked up.
[74:48.38]Whatever, whatever.
[75:05.78]It'll be a new baseline.
[75:10.98]I'm so mad that that was a great finish, too.
[75:14.43]I only saved one second.
[75:35.38]Fuck you, I did the same thing last time!
[75:48.76]Oh, here he goes.
[75:49.36]He's gonna talk about aliens again.
[75:50.56]I don't know.
[75:55.10]All I remember is the Flintstones used to sell cigarettes.
[76:00.45]And it was like, oh yeah, that's fucking fine.
[76:05.36]So, excuse me for not trusting that there was an explosion that happened.
[76:10.83]Out of nowhere.
[76:14.52]Shit.
[76:27.68]What about creationism?
[76:28.70]There's another weird one too.
[76:32.34]Why?
[76:33.00]I just want to know why.
[76:43.65]why not but why why why not why why not can of worms now I don't know just around
[77:15.76]Why do you care about beating this level?
[77:17.08]Because I want to get S in Mario.
[77:18.75]Otherwise, I... What kind of gamer can I say I am?
[77:21.43]I thought that was my dog?
[77:30.24]What?
[77:38.89]I did it again.
[77:39.55]I'm so stupid.
[77:43.47]Also, with how, you know what, with how fast technology has gone, I wouldn't be surprised if it was aliens.
[77:56.43]We went from... Oh, that silent movie!
[78:01.07]To, uh, oh yeah, I'm just gonna watch, like, HD Infinity War on TBS.
[78:06.98]In less than a hundred years.
[78:09.78]Do you understand that it took, like, 10,000 fucking years for everybody to figure out that, like, you shouldn't eat the poisonous berries on the bush?
[78:27.70]Oh, yeah, well, you see, this is a little computer.
[78:29.37]It's 10 trillion nanometers small.
[78:31.85]500 years ago, we used to eat dirt.
[78:40.58]Huh?
[78:58.32]No, we still all eat dirt.
[78:59.58]We do.
[79:00.90]Did you guys know that you eat over an inch of dirt every single meal?
[79:05.37]That's fucked up, but it's true.
[79:07.27]You eat over an inch of dirt every single meal.
[79:12.10]And people go, what?
[79:13.08]Question mark, he's an idiot.
[79:13.92]No, every single time you eat, you eat over an inch of dirt.
[79:18.25]It's crazy.
[79:21.23]Because you have to be sitting on some kind of a table or it's on a plate, which is probably an inch off the ground.
[79:40.57]Ugh, how do you guys like hate me now?
[79:42.35]I don't know.
[79:44.63]You reused that joke?
[79:45.79]No, it's not called, it's called... Do you know how many people probably weren't here four years ago when I said that?
[79:52.92]Raise your hand if you were here four years ago.
[79:55.82]When that exact joke happened.
[79:59.47]I'm gonna freak out.
[80:04.89]Last round, right here, I got it, right on.
[80:09.44]One more real one.
[80:14.89]There's no new people here.
[80:16.03]You're retired.
[80:19.16]I did it again.
[80:20.38]Well, that doesn't mean people can't find the channel.
[80:26.53]This is the one right now.
[80:43.06]Oh my god!
[80:44.58]Get me out.
[80:45.04]I don't want to do this anymore.
[80:57.35]I got A++.
[80:58.37]I can't believe it.
[81:01.46]No, quit.
[81:08.87]What's the next one?
[81:09.51]Okay, this one's also really hard.
[81:13.48]Break 20 blocks.
[81:19.97]I think you get more than that over there.
[81:24.86]Watch me do this quick.
[81:47.43]Damn it, that's pretty close.
[81:52.10]I think the star messed me up.
[82:13.21]Oh dude, that's so much harder to do it over there.
[82:19.48]Too slow.
[82:32.04]Oh, you piece of dog shit.
[82:33.46]When you get caught on the edge, it sucks.
[82:49.23]Okay guys, favorite pizza topping.
[82:51.81]I'll go first.
[82:53.13]Pepperoni!
[82:54.07]I love how you can see my button presses in real time.
[83:16.49]I gotta go much slower.
[83:28.30]That was 0.2 milliseconds slower.
[83:35.24]Something about that second part screws me up.
[83:44.29]Jump, you fucking idiot!
[83:46.25]I'm gonna be pissed off.
[83:53.40]I'm fed up.
[83:55.20]I'm fed up.
[83:58.60]No, I'm just fed up.
[84:08.92]Oh, Johnny Knoxville.
[84:11.18]Oh, I'm just fed up.
[84:13.02]Oh, jackass.
[84:14.67]Oh, son of jackass.
[84:15.99]I can't break one?
[84:29.99]Can I put Rip Taylor in top 10 comedians of all time?
[84:34.18]Can I do that?
[84:34.64]I can do that, right?
[84:49.33]On whose authority?
[84:50.04]Mine.
[84:54.16]Look at all the confetti!
[85:02.05]I can't not hit that block.
[85:05.74]It's a block and it's available, so I hit it.
[85:11.99]No, Rip Taylor.
[85:14.03]You don't know who Rip Taylor is.
[85:15.91]Your required reading for the next week is to go watch stuff that he did.
[85:29.39]No, Riptorn is a different actor.
[85:34.80]Oh my god, I hate the button presses.
[85:38.46]I don't care, won't watch.
[85:39.62]That's fine.
[85:42.12]You have your own free will.
[85:44.95]Given to you by aliens.
[85:48.33]And planets are eggs.
[85:50.07]They live.
[86:02.45]Oh my god.
[86:03.97]Okay, I have a fan blowing on me and it's blowing my hair all over my face.
[86:07.90]It's freaking me out.
[86:18.45]Every time I get to the end.
[86:33.08]Feels good.
[86:37.86]If you were a planet, what would you be like?
[86:39.04]Gaseous and constant windstorms surrounding it.
[86:43.71]Nice.
[86:54.56]Okay.
[86:55.26]I got mostly yeses.
[86:59.95]Beat Bowser.
[87:04.14]Oh, that's kind of a long one.
[87:09.96]Why are you stopping there?
[87:10.84]Just jump.
[87:12.36]I got this.
[87:18.50]Okay, for some reason, I thought you could run over those.
[87:21.16]But it's only one block that you can run over.
[87:44.09]Get out of the way!
[87:47.61]Alright, I can do that way better.
[87:49.95]How does bread happen?
[87:50.81]Like, how does yeast and flour make grandma's deli- yeah.
[87:56.46]What you said.
[88:12.34]Shit.
[88:15.15]His yeast is alive.
[88:17.66]What is alive?
[88:18.84]What does that mean?
[88:20.02]What is that?
[88:24.81]I do kind of feel like a professor the first day of college at like a, you know, philosophy class.
[88:29.85]That's written up on the board.
[88:34.32]I think I would be a great fake philosophy professor.
[88:36.48]I would bullshit my way through the entire course.
[88:47.22]How did I do this before?
[88:48.10]I could spend probably three weeks of academic literature discussing the planet shit we just talked about.
[89:13.36]Here we go.
[89:16.09]You... I got Kaizo... Kaizo blocks in this level?
[89:20.05]Since when?
[89:23.32]What?
[89:23.82]What?
[89:31.14]Professors have to teach stuff, dude.
[89:34.19]So?
[89:34.53]I could give tests?
[89:40.53]Are you saying that I wouldn't give...
[89:43.60]Saying I wouldn't give exams.
[89:46.42]It would be a blank piece of paper.
[89:49.84]You could hand in a blank piece of paper to me.
[89:53.66]And I'd say, okay.
[89:55.23]Okay.
[89:56.57]Why though?
[90:01.13]And you could just stand there.
[90:02.13]10 to 20 minutes.
[90:06.22]And explain to me why you handed it in.
[90:08.58]And if I... If I was like, okay, that was a good answer.
[90:12.28]Then you're fine.
[90:17.65]And after probably the seventh or eighth phone call from a very angry parent is when I'd say, I'd start clapping slowly and I'd say, there you go.
[90:29.06]That was the test.
[90:31.11]You see what happened here?
[90:32.59]And then I would bullshit for like a few hours on why that was exactly what I wanted to have happen to teach the philosophy of, um, understanding or something.
[90:44.22]I don't know.
[90:47.16]I had to focus.
[90:47.90]I didn't play the game.
[90:48.79]The philosophy of bullshit, yeah.
[90:56.26]Uh, Lakitu?
[90:59.97]It's kind of annoying.
[91:05.44]You wouldn't last the whole semester.
[91:08.88]I think I would.
[91:16.34]Or I would go all in.
[91:18.26]This is why it wouldn't work.
[91:19.86]Because I would go all in on the first four classes.
[91:26.59]It would be the best class you've ever been to.
[91:28.97]You would learn so much in those four classes.
[91:33.72]One hour each.
[91:34.92]I would teach you so much shit.
[91:37.78]And then I wouldn't give a fuck anymore.
[91:40.09]And I would stop coming in for the rest of the semester.
[91:44.69]That's the problem.
[91:48.77]I would kind of be like, I really don't want to do this today.
[91:55.34]I just probably wouldn't do it.
[91:58.43]And I would send emails out being like, hey guys, like, not doing no class today.
[92:01.97]Um, there's no class.
[92:06.96]See y'all next, um... You know what?
[92:10.38]Everyone get to B+.
[92:12.63]And we'll do a class trip at the end of the year.
[92:26.51]And you can get it up to an A- if you write a at least three to five page essay.
[92:35.42]That I watch you write, by the way, about how much you learned in the class and how good of an experience it was.
[92:44.33]I watch you write this so you don't put it into a fucking computer.
[92:55.80]Yeah, and you have to do it without the words C-H-A-T or G and P. Those would be ripped off the keyboard.
[93:12.97]So you wouldn't be able to even type it in.
[93:24.39]You'd have to give me your best without those five letters.
[93:34.10]You could just hand write it.
[93:35.14]I know.
[93:46.58]You're an evil professor.
[93:47.78]You know what?
[93:48.44]That would be kind of a funny thing to do.
[93:51.93]Has any weird colleges had, like, ooh, the evil, I'm an evil professor, and we're going to talk about evil, and that's the course?
[94:01.36]Or like a goofy elective or something?
[94:04.36]Has anybody done that?
[94:05.08]I gotta be way better than this.
[94:14.95]That is philosophy.
[94:17.50]Kind of true.
[94:28.73]Such shitty starts.
[94:34.76]Yeah, I would definitely take the evil class, but a prerequisite for me wanting to do that was the teacher, the professor, had to be in character the whole semester.
[94:46.37]Shit.
[94:56.62]That's a rotten, that was a rotten run.
[95:13.52]Would you ever do a Ted Talk?
[95:17.20]Um... I mean, I've done a Ted Talk into the mirror, pretending that there's an audience there, to be like, look, this is my Ted Talk.
[95:23.48]What profound things I have to say.
[95:25.02]I think everybody's done that at least once.
[95:30.29]But I don't think I'd want to do that in front of people.
[95:38.84]Can't do it.
[95:45.63]Don't act like you've never seen yourself with a blazer on.
[95:50.60]With a little remote control in your hand.
[95:53.04]And you know the first few sentences of what you're going to say.
[95:59.79]And everyone's quiet, and you get to hear that little... little kind of droplet sound.
[96:04.46]...
[96:18.13]I've practiced presentations, but not a Ted Talk.
[96:20.44]That's kind of similar, isn't it?
[96:25.24]Alright, good start.
[96:41.68]One is for school, the other is for delusion.
[96:47.04]What?
[96:47.34]You don't think that there's people that have lots of interesting stories?
[96:50.00]What do you mean, delusion?
[97:02.48]Gotta nail this.
[97:02.98]I fucking hate myself.
[97:13.85]Give us your intro, then.
[97:14.87]Okay, fine.
[97:36.67]Laughter.
[97:39.47]We all do it.
[97:51.75]But what is comedy?
[97:57.21]When I was nine years old.
[97:59.86]I don't know what that has to do with comedy, but they all laughed.
[98:13.93]Everybody that was in the room.
[98:16.35]And it made me think that day.
[98:21.38]What makes us laugh?
[98:22.86]What is the comedy that
[98:26.96]I'm really nervous.
[98:28.04]I'm sorry.
[98:28.54]I practiced this for a while.
[98:31.06]Um, so, if we take a look at this slide, there's some data on this slide.
[98:34.31]And, um... There you go.
[98:48.65]Shit.
[98:55.29]No, no, no, it would start out with... Those of you that have heard this story before, it would start out with... Hey, Mickey!
[99:05.94]He's dead!
[99:08.47]No, no, no, no.
[99:09.25]I'm just... Not... No.
[99:12.41]That's what I said.
[99:13.32]No, that's what I saw on TV.
[99:16.10]It made my brother laugh.
[99:22.71]I'm done with this one.
[99:23.41]Fuck this one.
[99:25.29]We're in the master area now.
[99:29.54]Get 30 coins.
[99:41.55]Now I would walk out there and I would have somebody run up and pie me in the face.
[99:46.32]Making the rest of the Ted Talk unbearable to listen to because it would be my eyes, it'd be irritating.
[99:51.38]The microphone would be all squishy and messed up sounding.
[99:54.86]And I would actually try to do the full presentation and it would not come out the way I wanted it to.
[99:59.88]Then I'd fall down a couple times.
[100:01.25]I would slip and hit the back of my head on the ground.
[100:08.67]And did people laugh at that?
[100:10.07]And I'd be like, what's going on with that?
[100:19.88]Somebody said again.
[100:20.89]Yeah, I just did it again.
[100:33.32]Yeah, you tell this horrible story of when you were a kid.
[100:35.56]You hit the back of your head really hard and had to get staples.
[100:40.32]And then somewhere in the presentation you fall and smash the back of your head.
[100:43.29]No, no, not again!
[100:46.13]No, not again, not again, please not again!
[100:48.63]I gotta go down and get those, um...
[101:05.26]I could never plan a route out.
[101:07.96]I couldn't do it.
[101:11.07]This is the master one.
[101:15.99]Fuck you.
[101:16.19]Come on, man.
[101:18.48]Just play through it.
[101:18.96]Play through it.
[101:20.24]Which one makes you go down?
[101:21.72]Not this one.
[101:22.18]It's this one, right?
[101:24.93]Which one makes you go down?
[101:27.85]Which one makes you go down?
[101:33.04]That one, right?
[101:38.32]I thought you're supposed to be speedrunning.
[101:48.97]Quiet for a second.
[101:49.61]I'll show you what I'm doing here.
[101:54.70]I'm just playing 1-1 normally.
[101:56.42]Hold on.
[101:56.88]This game's hard.
[102:02.84]You guys don't remember how, like, kind of floaty this game is.
[102:06.96]Hurry up!
[102:16.71]Why is it taking so long to get up?
[102:20.20]Oh my god.
[102:21.74]Where are the other coins?
[102:24.18]Wait, where are the other coins?
[102:36.42]Where are the other coins?
[102:54.04]It's apparently 30.
[102:54.54]There's only 23 coins in this whole level.
[103:12.08]You have to... Oh, you have to go to level 2.
[103:14.12]I thought it was just on 1-1.
[103:23.61]You think you became a streamer because you hit the back of your head?
[103:25.52]Um... I don't know, maybe.
[103:36.39]I've hit my head a lot of times, guys.
[103:43.73]It's probably fucking like bread pudding in there right now.
[103:47.42]Seriously.
[103:47.94]It's too slow.
[103:52.97]Absolutely immaculate start.
[104:02.48]Holy shit.
[104:11.74]Come on, go, go, go.
[104:17.97]Actually, not bad.
[104:31.34]Where are they here?
[104:32.81]I don't know where the coins are.
[104:38.63]How many times have I made that noise?
[104:54.17]Today.
[105:05.79]Shit.
[105:08.09]Mushrooms are wasting the time.
[105:10.12]True.
[105:12.04]True.
[105:14.88]Why are you mad at getting an A-plus?
[105:17.35]Uh, because I'm on a livestream.
[105:19.19]And anything under S means... Omegalull dot dot dot.
[105:23.98]Laughing out loud.
[105:24.88]Haha.
[105:25.54]He sucks.
[105:36.93]Beautiful.
[105:38.67]I hate everything.
[105:45.87]Nope.
[105:54.76]Why did I not jump?
[105:56.06]I just... I...
[106:00.81]Alright, I'm going faster than that asshole on the right.
[106:28.66]Alright.
[106:30.49]Don't get the mushroom, and I should have S. Oh, come on!
[106:54.16]What is it, under 50?
[106:55.20]I thought it was gonna be 55.
[107:04.11]I think I can shave some time there.
[107:19.73]Nice.
[107:34.63]It's okay.
[107:35.36]Still got time saved.
[107:39.22]Alright, is it better if I just skip all of them and just hit the block?
[107:45.73]I'll try it.
[107:46.25]That might be too much time, though.
[108:03.37]There it is.
[108:05.68]Alright.
[108:06.89]I'll take that.
[108:13.28]I'll take that one.
[108:17.22]Uh, we've been still on Mario.
[108:18.58]You know what?
[108:19.08]I'm on a Mario kick right now.
[108:21.09]Might as well keep going.
[108:24.81]Uh, enter.
[108:25.79]Oh, you have to do the skip.
[108:28.58]Where is the best place to do the skip?
[108:29.78]Up here, right?
[108:31.74]Yeah, then you jump across.
[108:37.61]Enter pipe four.
[108:57.93]That was such a shit.
[108:59.18]I'm so shit.
[109:05.62]Shit.
[109:12.46]Shit.
[109:19.59]Shit.
[109:35.04]What the fuck?
[109:36.81]Why am I not going fast enough?
[109:50.66]I had to do a... I had to rev it up a little.
[109:58.75]It's okay.
[110:07.28]You really gonna... You need to tell me that?
[110:08.72]That's only an A+.
[110:22.47]Clickbait arrow.
[110:25.78]Wait.
[110:27.20]I can't go back.
[110:42.85]Blew it already, but it's alright.
[110:43.81]I'll make it a faster time.
[110:51.11]Why did he stop?
[110:52.57]I slowed down because I pressed down accidentally on this stupid ass controller.
[111:00.13]Where every fucking button is the same button.
[111:02.43]The D-pad.
[111:03.03]Remember when they used to make D-pads for real?
[111:06.80]Instead of being one giant button that just wiggled around in a circle?
[111:10.93]Do you remember when they used to make shit good?
[111:19.81]We need a rage facecam?
[111:34.03]I thought about it, but no, I'm just chillin', I'm good.
[112:00.48]There it is.
[112:01.54]Don't slow down!
[112:02.71]Don't slow down!
[112:08.19]That was so whiny.
[112:25.57]It's not fair.
[112:32.53]That's not even an A++.
[112:40.66]Grown-ass man, by the way.
[112:44.16]Yeah, on my 40th birthday, I'm not gonna make any more sound effects.
[112:48.25]This is it.
[112:48.65]I gotta get them all out now.
[113:01.93]How do I even improve this?
[113:05.37]He crashed out.
[113:30.73]Yep, I did.
[113:34.34]We have until September and then we are free.
[113:37.67]Well, I'm not gonna die.
[113:40.23]Um, okay.
[113:41.59]So... What do you mean we're free?
[113:51.31]You don't know that.
[113:52.73]Yeah, I could get hit by a train tomorrow.
[113:54.81]Yeah, I don't know.
[114:00.16]And what is inside the planet?
[114:03.60]Glass?
[114:12.24]That's right, an egg!
[114:13.87]That's a lot of gold stars for homework there.
[114:17.69]I fucking hate this game.
[114:33.47]See, my problem is my fingers are too big for the Nintendo.
[114:37.51]I'm too old to play Nintendo.
[114:39.89]I grew out of the Nintendo, apparently.
[114:42.91]My fingers are too big even for the Pro Controller.
[114:45.40]Why?
[114:46.50]Why when I want to press right on the D-pad, I have to press every other fucking direction?
[114:52.10]I think I'm too much of a grown-up to play.
[115:06.36]Use the stick?
[115:08.26]That is puke-inducing for me on an old game like this.
[115:15.11]Analog on a 2D game makes me want to throw up.
[115:29.96]At least you're not dramatic about it.
[115:31.30]That might be a joke, because I'm pretty dramatic about it.
[115:35.96]Use the keyboard?
[115:46.81]I see where you're coming from, but no, I can't.
[115:48.97]I gotta be- gotta be thumbs.
[115:53.60]Why can I not do this first part every time?
[115:55.68]I'm just gonna- I have to memorize what I'm doing.
[115:57.30]I do that- that stupid jump to the left!
[116:06.18]It's pissing me off.
[116:11.49]This hair is going... I'm turning this fan off.
[116:17.10]Would I rather have it be 80 degrees in here or have my hair get blown in a circle?
[116:22.54]I don't know.
[116:27.27]I didn't think this fan through.
[116:38.21]I'm just gonna buzz my head.
[116:52.17]I'm actually getting so mad at Mario that you just take hair clippers to your hair.
[117:13.99]I cannot burn this into memory.
[117:17.55]I've done this probably 10,000 times, especially from the ages of 6 to 40.
[117:24.52]I've done this level probably 5,000 times.
[117:29.37]And my body and my brain just wants to do something different every time.
[117:39.08]Even if I say, hey, don't jump there, it just goes, jump now?
[117:42.35]Right now?
[117:54.77]You know it's because Mario has this forward momentum.
[118:04.07]That like if you don't correct it in the air sometimes.
[118:07.39]Like I'm trying to correct for jumping twice to jump over that block.
[118:13.06]And I'm about to smash this controller into a thousand pieces.
[118:26.21]How come I'm not able to do wall jumps like in Mario Wonder?
[118:45.54]Move on?
[118:45.90]No, I'll get it.
[118:50.81]You know what?
[118:52.29]The controller was not receiving input.
[118:57.38]It just wasn't.
[118:58.00]I had it pointed down, and it was not right.
[119:05.21]I swear it wasn't.
[119:12.92]A thousand people just left?
[119:14.08]No, they didn't.
[119:16.05]I just saw the view count go up by five grand.
[119:20.61]Stop distracting me.
[119:34.79]What the fuck, Nintendo?
[119:36.94]You're pro-professional controller.
[119:39.52]You're professional controller.
[119:50.52]Oh my god.
[119:51.48]I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[120:05.69]The reason why that keeps happening is because I'm holding right and this son of a gun is pressing every other button on the d-pad.
[120:19.13]Singular buttons.
[120:20.73]Singular buttons on the Switch 2.
[120:22.31]Is that out yet?
[120:24.61]Separate the buttons!
[120:37.16]I'm gonna let this sit for an hour.
[120:38.91]And I'm gonna let this sit for at least a full hour, and then go down, so they can see somewhere there's a data set that's like, holy shit, what happened?
[120:50.07]Alright, I got another break in one minute.
[120:51.57]I can do this in one minute.
[120:52.55]Here we go.
[121:06.47]Jump from the pillars onto the blocks to stomp?
[121:10.02]Wait, what?
[121:11.36]Oh, you mean you want me to do this?
[121:13.86]That's too... I can't go back, though.
[121:15.37]That's too hard.
[121:24.32]Not there?
[121:24.76]Alright, I got 30 seconds.
[121:31.15]From the pillars to the block platform.
[121:36.90]Oh, dude!
[121:37.88]Holy shit, you're the man!
[121:39.94]You just saved everything!
[121:41.07]Alright, cool.
[121:41.67]That's a good idea.
[121:42.27]Oh my god, why did I listen to the tutorial?
[121:51.66]Holy shit, it's gonna be the one!
[121:53.66]Look at this!
[121:54.84]Guys, look!
[121:56.41]Uh, an ad's gonna play.
[121:58.43]But I can't stop right now.
[122:03.40]Ads are literally incoming right now.
[122:06.16]It's gonna be S. I could do better than that.
[122:15.30]Alright.
[122:16.86]I'll be right back.
[122:20.38]You guys having fun?
[122:22.79]I am.
[122:24.11]I'll be right back.
[129:57.24]Hi.
[130:03.52]I can do that one better.
[130:05.20]Welcome back.
[130:10.89]Do you guys like corn nuts?
[130:15.08]Is this a corn nut community?
[130:22.67]I think corn nuts are one of the best snack ever.
[130:25.82]I don't know if you have to get to be 40 to care about that, but the last year or two, they've been one of my favorites.
[130:37.69]Come on.
[130:40.12]Chili cheese corn nuts.
[130:41.22]Do they make those?
[130:42.72]I know the ranch ones.
[130:47.67]Ranch ones are good.
[130:48.29]I like the originals.
[130:50.05]Original.
[130:51.17]All the way.
[130:58.84]I can hit that edge of that right lip and make it all the way, can I?
[131:11.73]Grape nuts?
[131:12.23]I've actually never had it.
[131:19.12]That was it.
[131:29.43]Tooth shatteringly strong.
[131:32.29]Yeah.
[131:32.76]Alright.
[131:33.28]Hold on.
[131:33.50]I gotta... You know what I mean.
[131:36.44]This is the one.
[131:41.93]Get Grape Nut Flakes, not the OG.
[131:46.71]Yeah.
[131:50.46]Why's that?
[132:02.91]Corn is such a wild fruit.
[132:06.72]I'm making a joke.
[132:08.36]Everybody can fucking relax.
[132:09.58]I know you started typing.
[132:12.14]Just sit down.
[132:12.66]Chill.
[132:26.50]That pisses me off that I jumped over it because it would have been much better, but it's S. I'm out.
[132:38.18]Water level is gonna- I'm gonna go crazy here.
[132:39.86]I hate water levels.
[132:42.39]Go to the pipe at the end.
[132:43.25]Dude, when this song plays in the new Smash Brothers, even for like two seconds during that melody, oh my god, it starts to get tingles.
[133:05.72]Who cares about this Flappy Bird level?
[133:28.08]I almost got an S.
[133:36.18]I'll get it right here huge
[134:06.98]Okay, I'm good.
[134:11.68]I'm making way too many weird noises today.
[134:19.35]I gotta relax.
[134:22.90]Cheap, cheap chase.
[134:28.04]This one sucks.
[134:32.54]Okay, there's two jumps.
[134:34.55]Three jumps.
[134:35.71]Watch out for that one.
[134:36.95]Okay.
[134:38.37]I think you just do it full send the whole way.
[134:41.90]Full send it the entire way.
[134:43.82]And just don't get hit by anything.
[135:01.35]What's your favorite Souls-like game?
[135:03.57]Uh, Bloodborne and Elden Ring.
[135:06.23]And then Demon's Souls, in that order.
[135:07.53]Huge.
[135:22.27]Yes!
[135:33.31]I don't think I do that again.
[135:35.39]I don't think I can improve on that at all, honestly.
[135:39.44]Alright, this is the legend one.
[135:40.74]This is 300 coins.
[135:43.50]For your eyes only, legend difficulty challenges are the toughest in the game and are much longer than the rest.
[135:49.45]If you want to optimize your clear times, you'll want to take a look at the classified information we've provided.
[135:57.86]Classified information?
[136:04.63]wait is this a speed run to just get to the end of the game oh alright so go to four one and then four ah this is a lot of info just have to beat the whole game as fast as I can no help let's go I'm gonna beat Mario brothers as fast as I can
[136:36.07]Let's see, like, actually blind how I can do this.
[136:50.26]I don't know why I even got the mushroom, but whatever.
[136:51.94]No resetting.
[137:00.21]It's already kind of bad.
[137:01.15]It's not good already.
[137:16.67]Do the bottom of the pole?
[137:18.61]That's true.
[137:29.38]No, I'm not doing a Let's Play.
[137:31.73]Oh shit, I gotta go- Wait, I can't even do the- Oh no!
[137:44.68]I need to take a second.
[137:49.42]Is there another mushroom?
[137:51.08]I need a mushroom or I can't do it.
[138:00.64]I'm restarting.
[138:16.08]No more restarts starting now.
[138:21.72]Ugh.
[138:31.34]Alright, good.
[138:54.48]Take the shortcut?
[138:58.34]Somebody said FaceTime audio quality.
[139:03.68]You mean me?
[139:05.57]What do you mean?
[139:21.97]I don't know where the skip in 4.2 is, but I'm going to try to find it.
[139:31.21]Alright, have I ever done... I don't think I've ever done 4.1 in my whole life.
[139:43.55]I know I just did it.
[139:54.03]Go, go, go.
[139:54.57]Fine.
[139:56.17]Don't blow it.
[139:59.91]Where's the mushroom?
[140:06.08]What am I doing?
[140:15.17]Go!
[140:20.22]Alright, where is the pipe?
[140:21.82]There's a thing you can go up.
[140:22.78]It's a climbing thing.
[140:31.42]I actually don't know where it is.
[140:40.68]I didn't remember that.
[140:41.82]I haven't played this in a while.
[140:42.96]Warp zone ahead.
[140:51.73]Wait, what?
[140:52.09]What does that mean?
[140:59.71]Why are they saying that?
[141:01.73]Oops.
[141:03.23]Wait, if I die I'll go back, right?
[141:05.32]No?
[141:10.08]Hold on, wait, wait, rewind it!
[141:11.85]Where is it?
[141:12.33]I don't... I don't know where it is.
[141:29.00]There it is.
[141:39.35]Okay, I'll remember that the next time.
[141:48.58]That may have been the slowest I could have gone through this.
[142:00.40]Didn't think you could do that, did you?
[142:18.98]Collect more coins to go faster.
[142:20.58]I know I'm not supposed to do that!
[142:28.67]Holy shit, did you see that?
[142:32.01]The speedrun has to look cool.
[142:57.02]Oh no!
[142:59.00]Oops!
[143:00.90]It's just muscle memory at this point.
[143:09.63]Sorry, it's even better than it was last time, don't worry.
[143:15.52]Much better, 1-1.
[143:23.74]Muscle memory of what?
[143:24.71]Of resetting hundreds of times.
[143:37.28]You have the same time?
[143:38.20]Well, we don't know because I don't have it up there.
[143:45.05]I didn't even do this last time.
[144:06.06]Okay, good.
[144:10.34]This one was pretty clean last time.
[144:21.74]Perfect.
[144:23.22]Perfect.
[144:23.62]That was like a f- 8.6 out of 10.
[144:39.77]The end was kind of bad.
[144:52.20]Okay, I gotta remember where that was.
[144:53.42]Oh my god.
[144:57.35]...
[145:11.80]oh yeah you can crouch jump I forgot way better time than last time though already
[145:41.96]Get in the pipe!
[145:54.53]I forgot that was there.
[145:58.26]No, it's not this one!
[146:08.42]Which one is it?
[146:10.36]Oh, no.
[146:12.07]Oh, boy.
[146:12.79]Oh.
[146:21.94]Uh-uh.
[146:38.42]Guys, you can't speedrun a level that you haven't seen in 35 years, okay?
[146:44.89]That's not how it works.
[146:58.84]Oh my god!
[147:09.15]You just saw it four minutes ago, not that part!
[147:21.94]I need a mushroom.
[147:31.98]Good.
[147:34.60]Oh my god, get out of the way!
[147:36.96]Why am I going so slow?
[147:40.82]Thank you.
[148:06.61]No, my god!
[148:08.15]Why?
[148:08.53]Why?
[148:08.85]Why?
[148:18.20]Oh, my fingers are just hovering over them.
[148:20.77]Oh, I'm so annoyed at myself.
[148:24.35]It's just... That's so frustrating.
[148:33.14]I feel like you should have to hold it for two seconds.
[148:37.34]It is immediate!
[148:45.73]It's just the second you do LR, dun!
[148:49.59]Whatever.
[149:01.23]Are you sure it wasn't a misclick?
[149:03.87]Yeah, that should pop up and you should have to go through three different menus.
[149:08.41]That was a trash attempt anyways.
[149:16.33]That level 8 was abysmal.
[149:22.28]It was terrible.
[149:23.54]We all know it.
[149:41.29]Just finish it once.
[149:42.86]I really wanted to.
[149:44.98]But the second that you have a moment where you go, oh, I screwed that up.
[149:48.22]Sometimes your brain just wants to go boink and hit Eleanor.
[149:56.95]I will not be doing that again.
[150:11.01]I completely forgot about that.
[150:12.11]I took a sip out of my drink in the middle of that.
[150:20.99]Ow.
[150:21.71]Okay, here we go.
[150:39.94]Okay, not bad.
[151:11.20]Now, if I can clean up this part here, then I should... Especially not crouch jumping, I should be fine.
[151:37.86]Oh my...
[151:42.64]Here.
[151:42.96]That's not what I'm trying to do!
[151:54.94]Actually, probably faster than what I did before.
[152:08.31]Every time, it's like being glued to the staircase.
[152:20.26]Clean this up.
[152:30.83]I don't know where the pipe is.
[152:31.66]I have no idea.
[152:33.48]There it is.
[152:45.60]That saved my life.
[152:48.83]No!
[153:15.03]No!
[153:28.01]I almost reset right there.
[153:41.96]Nice.
[153:45.73]Dude, I'm so used to the other Mario games where you jump on somebody and you go higher.
[153:57.08]This is like the only one where that doesn't happen.
[154:10.30]Okay.
[154:15.13]Oh my God!
[154:16.29]Dude, when you rewind like that and you just start immediately, it's kind of hard to pick up where you left off two seconds ago.
[154:23.97]Alright, we're good.
[154:48.22]eight three okay go above
[155:22.15]Ugh.
[155:30.23]What a crock of shit, honestly.
[155:44.77]Okay.
[155:54.06]This is it, right?
[155:54.78]This is the last level.
[155:56.57]I didn't even know that was here.
[156:11.53]Oh, my God.
[156:39.02]Wait.
[156:40.16]Oh, wait, I have to do something here, don't I?
[156:41.50]Okay, I have to go in a pipe.
[156:50.72]Wait.
[156:51.40]How do you beat this level?
[156:52.50]It's been 30 years.
[156:53.52]What do you do?
[156:59.70]There's another pipe I have to go in, right?
[157:09.01]This one.
[157:13.28]Okay, then this one.
[157:18.57]How many pipes you have to go in?
[157:34.79]Is this a Let's Play?
[157:35.99]Yeah, dude, I haven't played this game in 30 years!
[157:42.98]I don't remember what pipe sequence it is to do the pipe sequence puzzle to get to Bowser.
[157:47.12]It's been 100 years!
[157:50.19]This one?
[157:50.57]I don't know.
[157:57.99]I don't know what pipe it is.
[157:59.92]I'm gonna say this one.
[158:02.28]You can't even go in this one.
[158:14.46]That's not it!
[158:17.61]Which one is it?
[158:19.29]Wait, no no no, that was right.
[158:27.11]This one?
[158:31.01]Or is that it for the pipes?
[158:38.48]What the hell?
[158:39.08]This is in 8.4?
[158:42.52]What?
[158:50.89]I'm about to run out of time.
[158:52.52]Oh, the speedrun game.
[158:54.50]No, that's not happening, right?
[158:56.10]I can hit with the timer?
[159:06.46]Time Cool I got an A Alright now I have to beat that one
[159:34.96]I am beating this one right now.
[159:37.22]I can do it.
[159:38.00]Already way ahead of him.
[160:01.41]Let's go.
[160:09.37]Guy on the right sucks?
[160:10.23]Yeah.
[160:11.53]Screw this guy.
[160:30.66]What was he doing over there?
[160:35.23]I'm so ahead of him.
[160:37.83]How did he screw that up?
[160:40.79]I don't want to watch that, but I don't know how he screwed that up.
[160:50.94]That's the strat right there.
[161:07.82]Slow as humanly possible on that one As long as I beat the last one I just did I don't care
[161:37.87]Clean.
[161:43.26]Very clean.
[162:08.25]He's so far behind.
[162:09.29]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[162:11.05]I'm not trying to get an S rating.
[162:12.60]I'm trying to beat the guy on the right.
[162:14.74]Who's me.
[162:31.74]Don't care.
[162:38.79]Stop overthinking it and just go.
[162:44.30]Isn't there a skip pipe?
[163:08.66]Slow it down.
[163:09.38]Slow, slow, slow.
[163:28.14]I saw him die.
[163:34.24]I was doing so well.
[163:35.83]I saw the rewind on the right and it just made me laugh.
[163:45.70]I'm thinking like, oh yeah, that is how I died last time.
[163:57.88]You stupid asshole.
[164:08.02]I shouldn't be able to see the rewinds.
[164:10.98]Okay He's having some trouble over there
[164:48.26]Should I move?
[164:52.26]I'm gonna save, like, a whole minute.
[165:13.66]What are you doing?!
[165:14.49]No!
[165:16.29]The rewind's screwing me!
[165:18.62]The rewind is... What a disaster.
[165:35.92]It's okay.
[165:39.93]Here we go.
[165:40.37]I forget the pipes.
[165:48.28]Second pipe.
[165:51.55]This one here, right?
[165:54.83]The one after this.
[166:03.58]Then it's the pipe on top.
[166:21.43]Then it's... I don't remember.
[166:26.84]This one?
[166:27.12]I don't think so.
[166:33.35]Wait, if you go all the way back...
[167:00.15]Where is it?
[167:04.08]This one right here.
[167:06.08]This one, this one, this one, this one, this one.
[167:09.57]Go, go, go.
[167:11.91]Go, go.
[167:36.70]Oh my god, you fucking idiot.
[167:43.49]It's right here!
[167:44.61]A+.
[167:54.60]I'll take it.
[167:58.31]Alright, let's let the other guy finish up.
[168:09.05]I wasn't even in the second pipe yet.
[168:20.91]See right here, I'm looking over a chat desperately asking, is this the right one?
[168:34.20]How much longer is this one?
[168:35.36]I feel like it was only 45 seconds or so.
[168:46.57]953 oh it's at the top correct pipe is always the one on the right after the lava pit okay okay so here's the real question
[169:13.28]Now that I cleaned it up a little bit, do I go against this one at 813?
[169:22.79]Because now I know it's the pipe after... always the pipe after the lava.
[169:34.29]Just take the W. Alright, what else is there?
[169:38.86]Mario 2.
[169:39.70]Nice.
[169:40.84]Excite.
[169:41.16]There's so much cool shit here.
[169:44.13]Alright, what about... Let's do Excited Bike.
[169:49.84]Go around the track once.
[169:56.85]How do you play?
[170:12.39]Okay, you can do a super speed mode.
[170:26.59]Why am I doing so bad?
[170:43.71]How do you go faster than this?
[171:00.91]Shit.
[171:18.56]It's only A+.
[171:20.77]Do I have to land the bike better?
[171:25.01]Maybe I'm not landing it good.
[171:37.30]Keep turboing.
[171:38.40]I was holding turbo the whole time.
[172:05.66]shit ten five it's definitely ten under ten five you gotta catch it right before it overheats shit I got one hundredth of a second
[172:39.56]Okay, whatever.
[172:42.66]What's the next one?
[172:46.83]Go around the track once.
[172:52.94]Okay, but I know.
[172:53.54]I get it.
[173:04.91]Okay.
[173:16.35]Hey.
[173:30.64]Pretty good.
[173:33.27]Rookie landings?
[173:34.13]Yeah, landings could have been better.
[173:40.89]Alright, one more Excitebike.
[173:44.31]Go around the track.
[173:46.27]Some of these are very difficult, I remember.
[173:56.73]One more, one more.
[174:06.06]I don't want to do this one.
[174:10.97]Ooh, ice climbers.
[174:13.28]Reach the second floor in Ice Climbers.
[174:17.39]That's it?
[174:18.09]Okay, that seems easy.
[174:36.26]Okay, this game controls very weirdly.
[174:48.40]You gotta go through the first hole.
[174:54.83]Got it.
[174:56.59]Okay, that's that one.
[175:00.60]What's the hard one?
[175:03.96]Arctic Ascent.
[175:04.68]Reach the fifth floor.
[175:06.84]Oh boy.
[175:09.47]Is it gonna be a nightmare?
[175:28.73]Play Cooking Mama?
[175:36.84]How did I go down all the way?
[175:54.27]Let's shave some time off.
[175:57.35]I should play it, yeah?
[175:59.21]Which one?
[175:59.65]Aren't there like 15 of them?
[176:06.95]The one for the Wii.
[176:07.75]I think I already played it, didn't I?
[176:29.31]Probably under 10 seconds.
[176:30.24]Luigi's Mansion?
[176:40.72]That's a good game.
[177:11.53]Oh!
[177:12.90]I could smell that one.
[177:33.76]There it is.
[177:35.02]Alright.
[177:35.74]I feel good about that one.
[177:36.50]That was under 10.
[177:42.58]What about this one?
[177:44.31]Bonus or bust?
[177:46.49]Reach the bonus stage.
[177:49.74]Gotta go all the way up.
[177:54.38]Yes, play Elebits.
[177:57.05]The one thing I remember from Elebits was the game ran at 9 frames a second.
[178:04.24]It's a great game, but it runs like utter dogshit.
[178:14.97]cinematic framerate.
[178:16.05]I mean, that was really good, but it ended terribly.
[178:37.72]You guys still gonna play Oblivion?
[178:39.84]Um, alright, so all the Oblivion friends, I'll tell ya.
[178:44.55]We're doing Oblivion re- Okay.
[178:56.00]We're gonna be doing Oblivion Weekend.
[178:58.55]What does that mean?
[178:59.19]Oh my god, I'm wicked excited, I love that game!
[179:10.45]Uh, Saturday and Sunday over the holiday weekend, I'm gonna play a shitload of Oblivion.
[179:18.18]I really do want to play it.
[179:19.82]I'm going to.
[179:21.39]This is the weekend for when I'm ready to do it.
[179:23.69]I was gonna do it today, but I forgot that I had this game.
[179:32.18]I was really excited to play this, and I think it's very fun, and I'm engrossed, and I'm here for this game.
[179:45.20]Come on.
[179:56.89]That should have hit.
[179:57.91]And it didn't.
[179:58.61]And I'm annoyed by it.
[179:59.27]What is going on here?
[180:01.14]Did you see that?
[180:16.84]Can we do Zumba?
[180:19.22]Zumba's a good game.
[180:30.02]I never really was an Ice Climbers fan.
[180:33.58]I respect the game, but I never really cared to play it.
[180:36.83]As you can very plainly tell, I still don't understand quite the hitbox of this mallet.
[180:59.43]That's a PB.
[181:00.05]Improvement, I'll take it.
[181:02.79]Alright, last try and then I'm gonna take another break.
[181:06.70]Play Glover.
[181:07.14]Yeah, I've played Glover before and, uh, the- everybody hated it so much.
[181:10.86]I lost thousands of subscribers.
[181:14.01]People were saying, that's the worst thing I've ever seen, don't ever do that ever again.
[181:16.53]Boring, I'm leaving.
[181:20.41]I don't think you guys remember just the- the absolute vicious chat that was there for Glover.
[181:29.67]It was vicious.
[181:33.28]I was one of them.
[181:34.70]Because I said the game was terrible.
[181:53.79]Come on, man.
[181:55.55]Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[181:58.24]How do I?
[181:59.14]Okay, quit.
[182:00.73]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[182:02.84]I will get an S on this and then we'll do another game.
[182:06.55]See you in a few.
[187:07.75]I am back.
[187:12.47]Welcome back.
[187:16.78]Okay, uh, let me try to get to S on this one.
[187:28.25]Nope.
[187:29.83]Is it hey what's up bong breath?
[187:35.40]Do you have bad breath when you hit a bong?
[187:38.99]That's not how that works.
[187:45.67]Does your breath smell like bong water or something after you hit the bong?
[187:50.26]What does bong breath smell like?
[187:53.00]That sounds awful.
[188:02.25]Just musty.
[188:07.01]Shit.
[188:16.04]Change the water frequently?
[188:17.47]True.
[188:21.89]You guys know, I've never hit a bong in my entire life.
[188:25.72]Ever.
[188:28.56]And I'll be honest, I kinda don't plan on it.
[188:48.39]Keep hitting that bird.
[188:50.51]I don't believe that.
[188:52.43]You can believe whatever you want to believe.
[188:53.57]I've never hit a bong.
[189:03.24]That would have been it.
[189:04.53]If I didn't get stuck on that first jump.
[189:06.99]Still not S. How is that possible?
[189:28.31]Ugh.
[189:30.12]This game drives me crazy.
[189:32.90]Is there a certain thing, for those of you that are speedrunners, speedrunners, those of you that have done it before, I understand that itch in your brain that you can never, ever scratch.
[189:43.49]Do you know what I'm saying?
[189:47.50]It's like having a back scratcher, and you have it just barely, just barely above the place where you actually want to scratch your back.
[189:59.62]And sometimes you get a little closer and you go, oh, it's right there, it's right there.
[190:19.11]You're 50 and no bong.
[190:36.10]You've got to be shitting me.
[190:37.28]That was perfect.
[190:38.08]50 and no bong.
[190:49.84]I don't know what that one means either.
[190:55.35]Alright, I'm going to give up on this one in about 5 seconds.
[191:11.40]I don't like the way that it hits the... It's too finicky.
[191:23.25]Alright, five more tries, that's it.
[191:41.90]Three more.
[191:46.04]Two more.
[191:50.05]Last one.
[191:57.28]And you slide to... Oh, fuck this game.
[191:59.66]Fuck this game.
[192:02.49]Stupid ass game.
[192:04.59]Stupid balloon fight.
[192:05.31]Way better.
[192:09.54]Alright, pop one balloon in Balloon Fight.
[192:11.82]Oh shit.
[192:26.44]I think I can do better than that.
[192:27.52]I think I can go faster.
[192:50.63]How is that slower?
[192:51.55]Okay, whatever.
[192:52.07]Let's do the next one.
[192:54.77]Balloon Bopper.
[192:56.68]Beat all the enemies.
[193:01.58]This game is so fun.
[193:08.87]I can get a ball in one go.
[193:20.24]That's not it?
[193:45.74]You can definitely get them all.
[193:48.56]I gotta get them all.
[193:49.10]Come on.
[194:01.99]You had a Nintendo Power Glove, didn't you?
[194:04.58]Um, I think I did.
[194:05.88]No, I didn't.
[194:09.26]Why would I lie about that?
[194:12.32]I think I've seen one in person when I was younger.
[194:25.36]How do you do that faster?
[194:39.56]Was the lore behind this game?
[194:42.40]Uh... You pop everyone's balloons.
[194:46.97]I think.
[194:47.29]That was it.
[194:58.23]Wait a second, you can go across!
[195:19.67]Die!
[195:20.27]Oh my god.
[195:26.56]What is the right way to do this?
[195:29.88]Exactly the same.
[195:40.62]Whew!
[195:48.49]Barely.
[195:50.84]Let's stay on balloon fight.
[195:51.72]I like it.
[195:53.62]Okay, pop three balloons.
[195:55.66]One, two, three.
[195:56.72]I'm gonna go top and then bottom.
[195:58.25]I think that's the best way to do it.
[196:00.63]Maybe just straight through.
[196:01.49]Hmm.
[196:17.48]I think it is just straight across.
[196:18.40]Get the one down here and then up.
[196:24.27]Maybe the one underneath it.
[196:31.80]No, you gotta get the one up top.
[196:43.61]Maybe not.
[196:52.53]Hmm.
[197:05.22]Can I fall to the bottom faster than I can get to that second one?
[197:12.25]Hmm.
[197:24.54]Fly up from the bottom?
[197:27.91]I don't think I can... Huh.
[197:33.35]Hmm.
[197:33.64]Huh.
[197:34.58]Hmm.
[197:34.68]Intriguing.
[197:37.52]Hmm.
[197:37.68]Can't seem to go right again.
[197:39.48]Dude, you hit your peak?
[197:44.11]No, I have not!
[197:45.41]Actually, yeah, I have.
[197:46.09]Oh, who cares?
[197:46.65]Yeah, I have.
[197:51.98]I absolutely did.
[197:52.92]Yeah, that's fine.
[197:53.74]Cool.
[197:55.11]Let's just fucking ride it out.
[198:07.20]Maybe it is the top one and then immediately try to go down.
[198:18.45]I want this so bad.
[198:29.46]I gotta get that under five.
[198:41.28]You gotta immediately start falling.
[198:42.56]Go bottom then?
[198:59.28]It's a little slow to go up.
[199:00.38]Yeah, see, you can't really go up that well.
[199:08.09]Maybe bottom and mid.
[199:16.68]Shit.
[199:33.62]That might have been it, actually.
[199:34.56]Ooh, I think I got it.
[199:50.75]Yep, that's definitely it.
[199:51.72]You gotta go bottom and then all the way up.
[200:01.13]That's not it.
[200:03.79]Do that from the top?
[200:10.46]I can't really control it that well when I... I think it's gonna take longer.
[200:14.24]Maybe a bop and then wrap around?
[200:44.93]I don't get it.
[200:56.89]Wait a second.
[200:59.14]The top and the bottom ones are bait.
[201:00.98]Look at this.
[201:08.11]Maybe they're not.
[201:16.07]I missed it anyways.
[201:16.89]Alright, I'm doing this one more time.
[201:26.59]I don't get it.
[201:31.55]Defeat all enemies.
[201:33.69]Okay.
[201:54.81]Pretty good.
[201:59.50]Okay.
[202:04.75]Just moving on.
[202:05.31]Let's go.
[202:07.29]Pop all the balloons.
[202:09.75]Oh, yikes.
[202:15.96]Okay.
[202:28.24]That is hard to not hit anything.
[202:46.62]What about those new emodes?
[202:47.58]Yeah, that's true.
[203:00.68]You piece of shit!
[203:08.54]Going backwards is annoying, I will say.
[203:24.88]No!
[203:25.48]Fuck, that was such a huge compromise!
[203:32.20]No!
[203:33.82]No!
[203:34.76]No!
[203:36.96]I don't like that I'm doing that now.
[203:38.43]It's annoying.
[203:46.78]Neo.
[203:49.26]I hate this one.
[203:49.74]I'm not doing it.
[203:53.88]What about Mario 3?
[204:02.08]Okay, easy.
[204:10.59]I'm getting all these cool stickers.
[204:15.62]I gotta do something with them.
[204:30.50]Probably three seconds.
[204:37.66]Okay, you gotta hit it on the first jump.
[204:51.03]How come the clouds have eyes?
[204:55.66]Because it's a cute game, and it's a cute thing.
[205:02.85]coin collector I collect all the coins I have the tail right that was a busy maybe don't float
[205:30.58]How come my name is Destructio?
[205:32.04]Well, it's Destruction, but I couldn't put the N. There he is.
[205:37.42]Okay.
[205:37.63]S on that one.
[205:41.17]Super Leaf in the Wind.
[205:42.91]Get the Super Leaf.
[205:48.64]Easy.
[205:51.34]It's a very cringe name.
[205:52.44]That's fine.
[205:54.76]I peaked.
[205:55.20]I don't care.
[206:08.85]Dude, peeking is great.
[206:09.99]I don't know why everyone's so concerned about it.
[206:12.57]It's wonderful.
[206:25.83]You're free.
[206:31.36]That should kill them.
[206:37.06]That doesn't kill them?
[206:37.78]I thought it did.
[206:42.09]Gonna be under five seconds.
[206:47.36]When did you peak?
[206:49.49]Uh, I peaked in my life.
[206:51.35]Probably, uh, 2021.
[206:52.85]Or 2020.
[206:57.36]I think I- my life peak was about 2019 to, like, 2022.
[207:01.40]I don't know how I feel.
[207:05.41]I think I had multiple peaks, though.
[207:08.59]Not S.
[207:13.97]I think it was a series of little mountains, but that one was probably the largest one.
[207:28.62]I feel like this is the peak.
[207:32.31]No, this is post.
[207:33.43]This is post-peak.
[207:42.44]This is 100% post-peak.
[207:44.54]Seaman was probably the peak.
[207:47.12]Well, I'm not even talking about the stream either.
[207:48.93]I'm talking about just my entire life.
[207:55.93]Who knows?
[207:56.25]There might be another one.
[207:57.90]I might have another peak.
[208:00.98]But who cares?
[208:01.48]How do I drop this better?
[208:15.21]Hey, life is not just a gigantic upward vertical mountain and then a cascade down.
[208:22.60]It's just a series of valleys, a series of little mountains and valleys.
[208:26.38]Some of them might be a little bit bigger, but it's not like that.
[208:36.33]Now just watch Super Mario jump on people's heads and crush their skulls.
[208:53.87]Don't land on his head.
[209:02.11]Oh, thank goodness.
[209:02.73]Okay, I can move on.
[209:08.74]Hammer Brothers.
[209:10.29]Defeat the enemy and get the treasure chest.
[209:13.41]Easy enough.
[209:24.95]That's kind of good for the first try.
[209:29.06]You like Funyuns?
[209:30.48]I like one Funyun and that's it.
[209:38.97]Well, maybe like three.
[209:48.89]That's bullshit.
[209:49.73]Is it RNG?
[209:50.51]Is it random?
[209:58.67]It's not?
[209:59.09]Then why is it going over there?
[210:14.52]Damn, that's not an S. Opposite side, ah.
[210:32.52]I don't know how to make that faster.
[210:34.56]350?
[210:44.07]Catch it in the air?
[210:50.68]Nice thinking.
[210:58.73]Okay, just get to the pipe on the right side.
[210:59.99]Easy.
[211:07.77]Thought I had it immediately.
[211:16.13]That would have been it.
[211:18.85]You ever sneeze so hard your back hurts?
[211:20.86]You ever sneeze so hard that you think your head's gonna come out of your shoulders?
[211:25.49]Or you ever sneeze so hard that you feel it into your anus?
[211:44.48]I actually don't like sneezing.
[211:47.52]Sneezing is not fun.
[211:51.36]Because half the time I think, here comes a sneeze.
[211:55.19]I'm in, this could hurt.
[212:06.72]Also, if you're eating anything too while you're about to sneeze...
[212:10.19]This is one of my tweets that I had.
[212:11.54]I think I talked- did we- I think we could go over the tweet about how sneezing while you have food in your hand or food in your mouth is like getting to a yellow light at an intersection.
[212:23.73]You either need to slow down or you gotta speed up.
[212:27.64]It's a- it's the same feeling.
[212:30.96]If you have two or three bites in your mouth and you feel a sneeze coming on, it's crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, swallow!
[212:36.35]Itch!
[212:37.89]Or it's sneeze.
[212:39.43]Oh, don't do anything.
[212:40.03]Don't move.
[212:40.29]Don't move.
[212:40.59]Put it... Tuck the pretzel to the side of your mouth and close it a little bit and slow down and sneeze.
[212:47.60]I hate it.
[212:59.45]Pinch your nose.
[213:00.86]Uh, do not do that.
[213:03.38]That is the... That is the quickest way to, like, blow your face off.
[213:09.90]Shit.
[213:17.59]Your station tubes are going to collapse if you do that.
[213:20.69]Do not fucking do that.
[213:25.93]Can't seem to hit it right in the middle.
[213:34.46]That was a massive increase.
[213:37.35]How do you get faster than that?
[213:47.48]Am I being too cute with this?
[213:56.53]Okay, I guess I was.
[213:57.64]That's annoying.
[214:02.80]Get the suit.
[214:21.33]I can catch that in the air.
[214:22.43]Come on.
[214:27.24]Anyone remember the Animal Planet show, Too Cute?
[214:32.50]Um... I don't.
[214:42.31]What's the Animal Planet show that we were watching?
[214:46.58]Holly, if you're here, what was that Animal Planet show we were watching and we were like, this is on Animal Planet, by the way.
[214:52.31]What was it?
[215:05.35]No, not Ancient Aliens.
[215:06.59]That's on Animal Planet 2?
[215:13.46]I don't know what it was.
[215:14.14]What was it?
[215:15.22]We were kind of laughing about it because we were saying this is on Animal Planet.
[215:27.11]Can I please get this incredibly simple one done?
[215:35.74]This one is so easy and I can't stop trying to be cute with it.
[215:51.69]Oh my god, why can I not do this one?
[216:01.23]Lost tapes?
[216:02.91]Uh, I don't think that's what it was.
[216:05.64]How can you tell which way it's gonna go?
[216:13.19]Alright, you run against the wall and jump back.
[216:36.97]There it is Beautiful What is this one?
[216:44.47]Clear 1-1 Can I cheat and hide behind the thing and then run?
[216:49.98]Does that work here?
[216:52.33]Is that on 1-1?
[217:17.12]button is it okay yep
[217:45.65]What the fuck are you talking about?
[217:47.05]I'm hiding behind everybody.
[217:48.30]What?
[217:51.30]Oh, no you're not.
[217:57.13]Dude, you're live.
[217:58.13]I... Uh-huh.
[218:10.84]That's a stupid thing to do.
[218:12.01]I'm just gonna run.
[218:14.29]You ever watch Legends of the Hidden Temple?
[218:15.79]Oh, you know it.
[218:16.85]It was a great show.
[218:32.67]There were so many great kids game shows too.
[218:38.85]What is a kids game show now?
[218:40.85]Do they exist?
[218:51.84]It's TikTok challenges now.
[219:02.17]Yeah, Guts, Legend of the Hidden Temple.
[219:05.35]There's at least three or four of them.
[219:19.94]Actually, it wasn't bad.
[219:28.98]The old green screen video game one?
[219:30.72]Yeah, Nick Arcade.
[219:33.12]That was a great one.
[219:44.50]Fuck.
[219:45.14]No.
[219:49.09]Eh.
[219:51.85]Would you ever go on a cracked game show like that?
[219:54.54]I think it'd be great if those came back.
[220:00.16]Like, everyone talks about how the younger generation isn't, like, doing anything.
[220:03.09]They're not going out, they're not going anywhere.
[220:05.03]Yeah, because they don't have a Nick Arcade to go to.
[220:07.75]They don't have a Guts to prepare for.
[220:09.21]There's no Legends of the Hidden Temple that their entire school can do.
[220:20.95]It's horseshit.
[220:31.87]Let me ask you guys this.
[220:37.96]If you had the opportunity with two or three of your close friends to go get on a game show where you can run around and play in a gigantic ball pit and answer goofy questions about Thomas Jefferson
[221:03.76]You would definitely do it.
[221:04.75]Damn it.
[221:33.97]Yeah, and while you're running around in the temple trying to put together the shrine of the silver monkey, some guy in a black costume rips open a closet and just, like, grabs you.
[221:46.93]And you are gone.
[221:47.85]You're out of the game.
[221:48.43]That used to scare the shit out of me when I was younger.
[222:02.32]Every time that would happen, I'd be like, no, no, I can see, he's right there, he's hiding in there!
[222:06.25]Nooo!
[222:12.59]And, it was total dog shit, because it was complete RNG.
[222:16.24]So, okay, if you don't know what Legends of the Hidden Temple is, I don't know how you wouldn't, but maybe you don't.
[222:21.15]It was a gigantic, kind of like dollhouse.
[222:23.74]Where there were 10, 15 different rooms, and you could kind of choose which room you wanted to go in to do different puzzles.
[222:29.57]This room, you had to put together a three-piece puzzle that was hidden across the room.
[222:32.95]This one, you had to do a series of levers.
[222:34.58]It was like a giant escape room.
[222:36.28]It was an escape room you were supposed to do in 60 seconds.
[222:40.37]A minute.
[222:42.31]But in the rooms, in two or three randomly spread around, you would go, oh, I'm going to go in to do the Shrine of the Silver Monkey.
[222:49.80]That's a puzzle I want to do.
[222:51.72]And one of these guys would just be in there this time.
[222:54.59]And you're just gone.
[222:55.93]You just lose.
[223:01.72]And some guy would come up from behind a curtain and just... And like grab you.
[223:07.08]It was scary.
[223:07.92]It was like a jump scare.
[223:08.64]It was terrifying.
[223:15.81]Yes, you do get, um, wards.
[223:18.11]You do get an ability to remove them.
[223:20.36]So if you get grabbed by one of the- I don't even know what they're called.
[223:23.00]But one of these guys, you could put out- you could pull a coin out.
[223:27.04]And they would just- you would kill them and they'd run away or something.
[223:30.23]And it would work.
[223:30.87]But you had to have the coins.
[223:31.99]And you get the coins by winning challenges, right?
[223:35.05]Temple guards, right.
[223:36.23]There's a life amulet.
[223:38.65]It was a bribe?
[223:40.12]Alright, I'm gonna freak out if I don't stop this right now.
[223:42.50]This one.
[223:43.88]I got A+, who cares.
[223:46.79]I do.
[223:51.28]Don't jump on the red turtle.
[223:52.46]I can't help it.
[223:53.22]I have to.
[223:53.70]I tried to avoid him.
[224:14.47]Oh, come on.
[224:15.35]That's bullshit.
[224:17.88]But yeah, those were awesome.
[224:35.49]I gotta get the P speed, yeah.
[224:36.89]Max the P meter.
[224:42.60]I completely forgot about the P meter, thank you.
[224:48.54]I can't jump over that?
[225:08.70]I don't think I can get it early because I can't jump over this.
[225:14.41]No, you can't do that early.
[225:24.48]There we go.
[225:30.07]Get out of the way.
[225:34.52]You getting cooked by the guy on the right?
[225:36.22]Yeah, because I keep restarting because I can't stand this game.
[225:51.32]How do you hate Mario?
[225:52.50]I hate Mario 3!
[226:02.20]Mario 3 is the Dark Souls 2 of Mario games.
[226:24.88]Alright, I'm fucking around, but...
[226:27.68]I love the people in the chat that are like, yeah, yeah, dude, dang, finally somebody says it.
[226:32.19]This game sucks, like, fucking finally.
[226:34.57]I'm free to spread my opinion.
[226:37.49]It's like, oh shit, uh-oh.
[226:47.18]Ugh, I can't do it.
[226:48.49]Alright, I'm doing this ten more times.
[227:02.70]Come on, why is this giving me so much trouble?
[227:04.48]I can't take it anymore!
[227:05.54]Don't you know how it works here?
[227:13.79]On Jeremiah 985?
[227:15.51]We say something and we immediately backtrack and damage control it.
[227:19.64]Immediately!
[227:21.88]Oh, say something that might be a little bit different?
[227:23.93]Or I might say it might be a little bit, uh, against the grain?
[227:28.01]Just backtrack it immediately.
[227:31.81]Welcome.
[227:32.85]Hope you enjoy your stay here.
[227:36.17]Or don't, if you don't want to.
[227:37.79]Like, you don't have to enjoy your stay if it's not, like, for you.
[227:40.56]You know?
[227:40.94]Like, don't worry about that.
[227:42.54]But if you want to, hang out.
[227:56.04]Big.
[227:57.76]Don't care.
[228:01.12]Big.
[228:02.56]Absolutely huge.
[228:04.42]Absolutely huge.
[228:13.18]I was joking, but I kind of didn't save much time.
[228:23.23]One, two.
[228:23.99]Alright.
[228:30.21]Hey, I just sold your channel on eBay for $35.
[228:40.48]That was a fucking lowball.
[228:59.57]What am I doing?
[229:05.28]Oh my god, I'm trying to be so perfect and it's messing everything up.
[229:19.66]I want you to run that back because that was absolutely jumping on his head.
[229:43.41]Yes, it was the show Insane Pools.
[229:45.34]Thank you.
[229:47.62]You got it.
[229:48.18]That's what I was talking about before.
[229:50.12]That was on Animal Planet.
[230:02.55]There's a show where a guy has a pool company that they cost like hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[230:08.25]At least.
[230:10.50]He builds this giant grotto in everybody's backyard.
[230:24.49]I'm happy with this, but I can do better.
[230:49.04]Alright, P meter is important right now.
[231:03.04]I hate that I'm addicted to this one.
[231:08.95]...
[231:21.39]What a run.
[231:29.00]Okay.
[231:29.12]Okay.
[231:33.00]Defeat the boss and get a magic ball.
[231:34.70]Oh, he took it.
[231:35.12]Okay, cool.
[231:36.52]Up, up, up, up.
[231:48.81]That's gotta be it.
[231:54.65]I'm actually surprised that wasn't closer than that.
[232:23.62]Could that be better?
[232:24.45]Peppa Pig.
[232:31.15]There's another kid on Peppa Pig.
[232:32.49]Who cares?
[232:48.40]I mean, if you care about Peppa Pig, if Peppa Pig is a show that you like, then I mean, then you probably care about it.
[232:52.45]So that's fine.
[232:53.61]That's cool.
[232:54.01]That's really another child of Peppa Pig.
[232:57.18]Interesting.
[232:58.01]What?
[232:58.65]That's weird.
[232:59.45]Do you like that?
[232:59.91]You like that.
[233:00.31]Okay.
[233:00.65]Well, that's fine.
[233:01.16]I don't care.
[233:19.36]I suck at this.
[233:33.87]Bingo.
[233:34.31]That might be... I could shave another second or two off that, I think.
[233:49.91]Shit.
[233:50.77]That would have been good.
[233:53.81]You being a porky pig right now?
[233:55.03]Why?
[233:55.19]Because I'm stuttering around?
[233:57.78]I can see that.
[234:05.18]Way better.
[234:05.60]Somebody just said I can't save another second.
[234:11.43]That was 39 seconds.
[234:15.78]I could probably get that under 9.
[234:20.79]Sub-9 is definitely possible.
[234:25.55]Not if you do that.
[234:46.72]Ah, one more pixel.
[235:02.64]This one in particular, I don't know why, but I like it.
[235:17.13]What's the point of this?
[235:18.46]It's boring.
[235:20.16]I think I timed out.
[235:31.70]Good.
[235:32.26]Good time that up.
[235:32.82]Good.
[235:43.22]Play Arkham City.
[235:45.58]I don't know.
[235:49.17]Probably not.
[235:49.45]I'm trying to get too cute with it.
[235:59.93]Who's Destructio?
[236:03.25]Uh, that's my little brother's account.
[236:28.02]Alright, that was kind of the dream, but
[236:31.67]Hey, it's better than before.
[236:36.81]I like the boss fight ones.
[236:37.67]They're cool.
[236:38.74]Hurt and Call.
[236:39.24]Larry.
[236:40.08]Invade the boss and get the magic wand.
[236:58.45]I'll just take an S right off the bat.
[237:00.71]That could be better too, under 10.
[237:23.72]Aye.
[237:40.20]10 seconds flat.
[237:41.58]Let's try under 10.
[237:50.50]Big.
[237:55.75]That could be a little tighter.
[237:56.92]It could.
[238:11.44]Last one.
[238:16.64]That was annoying.
[238:26.61]I'm happy with it.
[238:35.68]This level always scared the shit out of me when I was younger.
[238:37.36]The angry son.
[238:42.86]It swoops down, right?
[238:57.36]It's a terrible start, come on.
[239:00.64]Sun looks like you?
[239:02.55]That's fine, he's handsome.
[239:08.81]I forgot that existed.
[239:23.88]Ah!
[239:36.12]No... Stop screaming, I'm driving.
[239:43.67]Oh, go put a podcast on!
[239:47.57]That's way more brain... helpful.
[240:00.92]What did that even do?
[240:13.76]They put a podcast on that talks about how corn was invented.
[240:30.65]Did you guys know that 99% of all corn breeds and all corn that's ever produced is even edible?
[240:43.39]Weird.
[240:44.13]Crazy to think about that.
[240:48.18]We had to selectively breed corn so many times to get what is actually the edible one.
[240:59.44]I hate that it didn't jump.
[241:28.87]I love corn.
[241:32.30]Alright, last, uh, last run before the last, uh, not last break, but last run before the break.
[241:37.98]I'm gonna get it right here.
[241:39.74]This is the, I'm gonna actually get to zero and get S, and the ads are gonna start.
[241:44.23]Watch.
[241:51.82]I always forget about that stupid tornado.
[242:02.83]Here we go.
[242:03.57]Ads are coming.
[242:05.40]Fuck it, whatever.
[242:05.94]I'll be back.
[242:07.69]Back in three minutes.
[245:56.73]Welcome back.
[245:59.07]Shall we continue?
[246:06.85]I also heard that doing research on corn?
[246:12.02]They've been experimenting on it over the years.
[246:15.16]They have to do it in an underground cave.
[246:19.33]Because there is a risk of the, I don't know, the corn spores or something.
[246:25.46]There's a risk that if for some reason it got out, it could change corn forever and make it like inedible.
[246:34.46]Oh, I'm itchy nose.
[246:44.64]Yeah, they do research on corn in underground caves 300 feet into the Earth's surface.
[247:00.91]I don't know why I forget the tornado every time, even when I'm sitting here telling you that.
[247:06.64]That's so annoying.
[247:11.62]Isn't that just in Fallout, you dweeb?
[247:13.64]No, it's not.
[247:14.39]Why would... Look it up.
[247:16.99]You have a computer.
[247:17.55]You're on a computer right now.
[247:18.49]Look it up.
[247:39.48]Yeah!
[247:49.34]Even with the... ka-dunk ka-dunk ka-dunk.
[247:58.46]This is a lot of Mario 3.
[248:01.08]Alright, let's see the other ones.
[248:02.00]There's more.
[248:03.61]Somebody said, please play Kid Icarus.
[248:05.90]Please.
[248:07.62]So, I'll do that.
[248:08.59]Defeat four enemies.
[248:12.34]Okay.
[248:34.81]Did Icarus OG blows?
[248:39.54]I think it's, like, kind of fun.
[248:43.59]What?
[248:44.19]Where'd he go?
[248:57.25]That's not his.
[249:00.79]Miyamoto disowned this game.
[249:03.11]No, he didn't.
[249:04.72]This game's fine.
[249:05.84]What's wrong with it?
[249:19.19]Can you fly or something?
[249:32.30]How am I getting slower and slower?
[249:35.43]Uprising is sick.
[249:39.94]What's the one that, uh, Sakurai made?
[249:43.30]All of them, right?
[249:44.24]After this?
[249:52.25]Break all treasure pictures.
[250:02.45]Okay.
[250:02.57]Break that last...
[250:06.80]Well, that's kind of distracting.
[250:21.10]What about your thoughts on cream corn?
[250:24.08]Um... I really don't care.
[250:29.61]I'm sure it's fine.
[250:40.31]I think I've had it at Thanksgiving once or twice, right?
[250:50.67]It's probably as good as I'm gonna get it, but whatever.
[251:04.23]Ayy!
[251:06.67]That's on Cornholio.
[251:08.95]He needs TP for his butthole.
[251:13.10]Get to full strength and exit the chamber.
[251:29.87]Okay.
[251:32.19]That's a couple of S's.
[251:33.11]S.
[251:37.89]That's just a quick guess.
[251:43.00]I think this just beat the level.
[251:52.68]I love the rock remix of this.
[252:10.21]Can I just make this jump?
[252:11.57]No.
[252:20.32]Wait, what?
[252:30.92]Wait a minute, what's going on here?
[252:39.69]Oh.
[252:48.58]Okay.
[252:49.24]I get it.
[252:49.58]He didn't know.
[253:01.13]I know.
[253:03.35]Yeah, I didn't know.
[253:04.61]What the heck?
[253:05.13]He didn't know.
[253:09.17]You bet you wish facecam was on right now.
[253:12.33]It would have been horrible.
[253:13.29]You would have hated it.
[253:17.54]The best part about not face camming is I can do things that people would go, holy shit, look at that, how awful that was.
[253:23.91]And I can just make as many faces as I want.
[253:25.53]And you'll never know what they are.
[253:37.42]I can do much better than that.
[253:43.90]Okay, uh... In the video, I want... It seems like every time I get to the end of a... I almost said episode.
[253:56.21]Whenever I get to the end of one of these challenges, and I complete it at all, I say, I can do better than that.
[254:05.12]I want every time I've said that to be superimposed on top of each other at the same time.
[254:19.27]Are you pantsless right now?
[254:20.41]Nope.
[254:24.45]I have pants on.
[254:26.24]What a surprise.
[254:27.00]25 seconds, come on.
[254:39.01]How's your dick doing?
[254:43.44]Uh, time that person up for an hour, but I'll tell you.
[254:46.13]Going fine.
[254:47.78]It's pretty healthy.
[254:49.10]Things will be good.
[255:18.40]This is the one, for sure.
[255:30.27]Oh no!
[255:36.52]1t5 even, come on.
[255:44.43]You don't have to read every message.
[255:47.62]If I read every message that's been on the stream so far, that means there's been 60 messages the entire broadcast.
[256:01.55]What is it?
[256:07.20]That is not even S. What is going on here?
[256:16.72]Beat all the enemies.
[256:23.89]What flavor would you be?
[256:28.61]Uh, some kind of banana.
[256:42.42]Oh, no, no, no.
[256:42.93]Okay.
[256:43.33]You know when you have corn pops?
[256:46.42]You know the milk at the end of your corn pops?
[256:49.26]That.
[257:00.84]Add that to a list of specialty ice cream stores that definitely have that as a flavor of ice cream they serve.
[257:12.35]And it's the flavor of the milk after the corn pops.
[257:27.90]How did I do it so well the first time?
[257:30.74]You can shoot up.
[257:37.35]I don't like this one.
[257:38.35]This one's itching my brain in a horrible way.
[257:44.59]I'm taking the A+.
[257:45.55]I don't like this one.
[257:52.49]Get the Water of Life.
[258:03.09]This game seems fun.
[258:04.47]Why?
[258:04.63]What's wrong with this game?
[258:08.73]Do people actually unironically hate this game?
[258:13.62]Seems fine.
[258:29.86]Should I do the left side then?
[258:35.17]I don't like that holding down makes you go down considering pressing left on the d-pad sometimes just presses down on the d-pad.
[259:00.03]The Switch Pro Controller sucks.
[259:10.58]There it is.
[259:11.06]Okay, I get it.
[259:17.41]Okay.
[259:21.19]Mario 2 is really fun.
[259:23.09]Ice Climbers, Balloon Fight.
[259:24.90]Mario 3.
[259:26.80]The Adventure of Link.
[259:28.81]Super Mario Bros.
[259:29.77]2.
[259:31.77]Oh, Kirby.
[259:37.10]Inhale an enemy.
[259:47.71]This game was awesome.
[259:49.99]I had this for the Game Boy and I loved every second of it.
[259:59.11]A lot of coins.
[259:59.85]Can I buy something else?
[260:00.85]What else can you do?
[260:02.16]World Championship Survival Mode.
[260:05.80]Pin Collection.
[260:09.39]Oh, I can make a favorite.
[260:16.48]I like this one.
[260:26.29]I like this one.
[260:28.13]I like this one.
[260:31.80]That one.
[260:38.39]I got a lot of money.
[260:39.03]Let's spend some.
[260:39.69]Okay.
[260:41.17]What's the $1,000 Mario icon?
[260:45.62]Oh, okay.
[260:46.06]Cool.
[260:55.55]I like this one, too.

[263:07.47]Alright, just me versus the NES generation Aura.
[263:14.50]Okay, take flight.
[263:16.64]Enter the door.

[263:44.29]Yes!
[263:47.77]Oh, cool.
[263:48.54]I just beat it.
[263:49.36]I just won my first game.
[263:53.94]That's cute.
[263:54.52]I like that a lot.
[263:55.20]That's fun.
[264:05.66]Okay, so I did that.
[264:06.62]Now what about gold division?
[264:09.28]This is against way better players, I think.
[264:13.61]Same set of games?
[264:14.53]No, this is different.
[264:17.17]Reach the mountain summit.
[264:19.82]Okay.
[264:21.02]Yeah, you gotta use those, guys.
[264:26.55]Alright, I'm bottom right.
[264:35.19]Shit.
[264:37.51]Just go.
[264:52.43]I got eliminated.
[265:00.75]I was good at this one.
[265:18.76]That's right, I place.
[265:20.26]I move on to the next round, that's fine.
[265:25.64]As long as you get in fourth place.
[265:30.68]I was pretty cracked at this one.
[265:48.97]That's okay.
[265:50.35]V versus you.
[265:53.58]Final round.
[266:02.46]Oh, that's not good.
[266:04.18]Shit.
[266:24.45]I just spit everywhere where I saw them.
[266:30.22]What did I do there?
[266:35.45]This is a great start.
[266:39.94]And then I just choked so bad right here.
[266:41.85]Oh, they choked too.
[266:46.23]That could have been anybody's game.
[266:57.97]It's a gold division.
[266:58.79]I'm going to do that again.
[267:00.78]I don't want to do taking flight again.
[267:07.48]Do these change once a week or something?
[267:09.80]Is that why they're the same?
[267:26.59]they do okay I was gonna say this is a great thing maybe it's hard to keep track of but I would I would like it if all the games were in the pool that'd be I think a little bit more fun maybe they were this game came out a while ago right

[268:30.56]Kind of good at that one, I think.
[268:38.13]That's really cool.
[268:39.55]I'm sure it was really cool when it changed more frequently.
[268:42.62]It might be on rotation.
[268:43.98]I don't know.
[268:47.96]The challenge order is random.
[268:49.47]Okay, yeah.
[268:51.15]Alright, so then what is World Championship?
[268:54.65]Take on weekly challenges and log your championship best time to compete for world and birth year rankings.
[269:01.14]Let's do it.
[269:09.45]I'm gonna enter the championship.
[269:33.55]Alright.
[269:34.64]What did I get?
[269:39.40]Oh, players are announced next week.
[269:43.39]Oh, shit.
[269:44.03]Okay, well.
[269:49.08]Shit.
[269:50.60]Okay, cool.
[269:51.48]Well, that's fun.
[269:54.12]There's more that I have to do.
[269:55.20]I want to do... I didn't even do the first one of this.
[269:59.27]Zelda 2 to beat three enemies.
[270:06.44]I could do that faster.
[270:30.25]Did I wait?
[270:36.75]That would have been it right there.
[270:38.27]You jump over him.
[270:45.54]That was dumb.
[270:51.23]Why am I so bad at this?
[271:08.49]What?
[271:09.12]How do you pick it up?
[271:40.89]Yeah, I get it.
[272:00.24]Fairy finder.
[272:05.29]Get the fairy.
[272:08.40]A simple jump?
[272:09.88]Why not just jump right in the air right now?
[272:21.93]That was awful.
[272:39.47]Cliff jumping across the cliffs.
[272:42.73]Easy enough.
[272:54.23]That was annoying.
[273:21.57]Where's the Oblivion gameplay, bro?
[273:24.85]Oblivion Saturday and Oblivion Sunday.
[273:28.50]Coming soon.
[273:29.40]Oblivion Saturday.
[273:30.42]I know everybody can't wait to see the Acrobat Magician.
[273:46.83]Neither can I. I'm looking forward to it.
[273:54.66]Get the key.
[273:57.03]This game seems really fun.
[273:58.77]It's been a long time since I played it.
[274:16.70]Okay, this is not Mario.
[274:21.44]You can't jump.
[274:24.73]Alright, so it's literally just walk left.
[274:44.27]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[275:03.44]Peak gameplay.
[275:07.31]Yeah, that was inexcusable.
[275:27.31]Yes.
[275:30.99]There's a lot of Zelda, too.
[275:34.06]Okay, well I know I can do this one.
[275:36.42]I already got S, don't even need to do it again.
[275:41.89]Get to the left area.
[275:46.03]Okay.
[275:46.15]How do you feel about Dr. Pepper?
[275:48.40]Uh, it's good stuff.
[275:52.66]It's delish.
[276:05.26]I'm so mad about that, I have to do it again.
[276:21.84]You fall, then you jump.
[276:36.88]There is a way to get that to be 11, but I don't know what it is.
[276:40.06]Defeat the iron knuckle.
[277:07.73]Okay, I get how it works.
[277:18.65]Do better than that.
[277:37.87]Maybe I can't do better than that.
[277:39.01]I gotta sit up.
[277:51.86]I hate it.
[277:56.51]Get the magic jar.
[278:06.27]What?
[278:16.33]What, it's underneath me?
[278:19.26]Oh.
[278:20.97]Where is it?
[278:48.05]Okay, so it's over on the right.
[278:57.98]Faster than that.
[279:02.23]Come on.
[279:17.48]What's in the top one, you stupid shit?
[280:00.80]I hate this one too.
[280:01.50]I can't do it.
[280:03.64]Alright, this one.
[280:04.30]Nayslayer.
[280:06.61]Defeat Mazura.
[280:28.21]Gotta hit him in the head.
[280:47.90]Jump attacks.
[280:48.54]I'm gonna lose it.
[280:49.78]I'm doing it.
[280:50.28]I'm doing that exactly.
[280:59.15]This one's making me so much more angry than all the other ones.
[281:21.60]This is not my fault that he's not on the screen.
[281:28.38]Damn.
[281:29.59]Okay.
[281:56.95]I could do that much better, actually.
[282:06.66]Last try.
[282:19.41]Unfortunate.
[282:22.52]Super unfortunate.
[282:24.74]I got off the screen way too far ago.
[282:35.37]I don't care.
[282:36.40]I beat it already.
[282:39.08]Alright, these are the hard ones.
[282:42.27]Rebunak?
[282:43.05]Defeat Rebunak.
[282:53.97]Where is he?
[283:04.69]Does he just spawn?
[283:17.74]What the hell is this bullshit?
[284:00.93]How do you hurt him?
[284:18.90]How do you do magic?
[284:38.48]Dude, I kind of just kicked his ass.
[284:47.25]Rescue the child.
[285:08.02]Is this correct?
[285:17.06]It was correct, okay.
[285:19.48]Let me do that again.
[285:27.53]That slowdown, the NES slowdown, just reminds me of the Ninja Turtles game every time.
[285:38.03]There we go.
[285:38.69]That should be us.
[285:46.85]Only a couple more for Zelda.
[285:49.95]Defeat Barba.
[286:16.22]I can do better than that come on I need this
[286:51.72]No, it needs to be on the last one.
[286:53.72]It needs to die on the last one.
[287:06.22]There we go.
[287:08.35]I can die at the end, it's fine.
[287:11.41]Come on, I need this!
[287:15.38]Parappa Palace Pro.
[287:17.04]Clear Parappa Palace.
[287:19.08]This is the legendary one?
[287:31.99]Okay.
[287:37.59]Is this the notorious hard level?
[287:45.22]Tell me to go this way.
[287:45.96]The first real dungeon.
[287:55.00]Ah.
[288:03.79]Okay, there's one key.
[288:21.90]Going for S, S, S, S, S, S. Give me S. Give me S.
[288:33.28]Oh shit.
[288:40.71]Oh shit.
[288:42.79]Oh shit.
[288:49.04]Oh shit.
[288:53.53]Oh shit.
[289:00.14]Oh.
[289:01.24]I don't know where I'm going.
[289:29.56]That game's too hard.
[289:37.13]Ooh, Mario 2.
[289:44.26]This is a fun one.
[289:54.41]Oh, that hurts my head.
[289:55.61]The fact that I didn't get there.
[289:58.07]I love this game.
[290:01.36]This is one of my favorite concepts of a game.
[290:05.62]Because it was a different video game.
[290:12.97]You gotta be pixel perfect to get S. Pixel perfect.
[290:39.55]Let's line it up.
[290:42.66]Nope.
[290:53.27]There it is.
[290:55.68]I'll take an S. Veggie plucking.
[291:00.48]Pick up a vegetable.
[291:10.24]Can you get to the end for one second?
[291:15.07]Somehow that's faster.
[291:16.11]Can I go faster than that?
[291:27.35]Okay.
[291:27.79]I was gonna say, how slow can you be and still get A?
[291:40.45]Get the mushroom in subspace, yep.
[291:57.92]I'm holding Y and I shouldn't be.
[292:12.46]That was slow.
[292:20.21]What a shit throw that was.
[292:35.55]Nice.
[292:38.93]I did this one.
[292:39.33]I already got S on it.
[292:41.88]Oh, I love the egg toss one.
[292:43.02]This is fun.
[292:46.74]These are some of the most fun little mini bosses in any video game.
[293:02.06]Ah.
[293:09.97]Maybe one day I'll just play this game and play the whole thing.
[293:12.42]I love this game.
[293:20.53]You guys think it would be fun to watch that?
[293:24.17]It'd be fun to play it.
[293:31.18]I don't think Mario 2 is particularly long either.
[293:35.08]I'm being cute with it again.
[293:40.92]Stop being cute with it.
[293:53.66]Stop being... I... A funny noises.
[293:59.23]I've been a funny noise.
[294:18.08]Screwed up the last one.
[294:56.71]Good.
[294:59.93]How did I not get that one?
[295:05.80]Skimmed it.
[295:12.97]Alright, three more tries and I'm done.
[295:16.01]That one didn't count.
[295:16.95]I have to actually get the first egg.
[295:35.83]Yes.
[295:39.75]Got it.
[295:42.32]Desert Dash.
[295:44.40]Enter the Pyramid.
[295:45.31]I think Toad was the optimal character to play in this game.
[295:50.16]He didn't have any superpowers, but he was just classic.
[295:53.22]He was clean.
[296:09.73]It jumped over you.
[296:12.73]Peach was the best.
[296:14.05]Because Peach could float.
[296:21.39]What on Earth am I doing?
[296:39.66]This is not optimal.
[296:59.82]That was very unoptimized, but I'll try it again.
[297:14.29]If you hit this pixel perfect, you can get it.
[297:22.78]You can pull him and just keep running.
[297:29.71]Pick him up!
[297:31.77]Annoying.
[297:36.90]Pick him up!
[297:47.45]My hand slipped off the controller because my thumb is as big as the entire D-pad.
[297:53.31]I'm gonna be- I'm gonna complain about it every 15 seconds.
[297:58.99]I would make the best controller.
[298:00.31]If you gave me the keys to the entire kingdom, and you said, hey, make any controller, everyone will be forced to use it, everyone will have to use it, because it'll be the best.
[298:07.60]I'd be like, great, good, I'll do it.
[298:09.12]I would make the world's greatest controller, because I would take all the shit that we all talk shit about, all the complaints we've ever had through gaming history, and it would be perfect.
[298:24.04]There'd be a cup holder on this thing.
[298:29.52]Buttons would be mechanical keyboard type buttons.
[298:33.68]Not this mesh dog shit.
[298:45.82]The triggers wouldn't make click sounds, but there would be a little bit of pressure on them.
[298:52.23]Alright, shh.
[298:52.95]What?
[298:59.24]How would you not spill your drink?
[299:27.87]I get hit by that every single time.
[299:46.27]Do you still apply a lot of chapstick?
[299:50.49]Um, sometimes.
[299:50.97]Depends.
[299:52.25]Not really.
[300:02.79]You see how many times I press down there?
[300:04.43]I don't want to press down.
[300:07.21]Imagine if there was a tactile, mechanical keyboard type shit.
[300:11.02]Can you imagine if it wasn't a mesh for four buttons?
[300:14.72]Can you imagine a world?
[300:35.86]Oh, I had it right there.
[300:36.92]That was the one.
[300:38.89]Alright, last try and then I'm taking a break.
[300:50.14]You trying to sound cool when you say mechanical keyboard?
[300:53.55]No, what I mean is that I want it to be an individual button that actually has a press, not on a mesh.
[301:02.83]Let's go.
[301:15.80]Membrane, you mean?
[301:17.20]Yeah, whatever.
[301:27.19]Pull up the rocket.
[301:28.11]I love the rockets.
[301:29.07]They were so fun.
[301:32.48]such a cute thing to have in a game that is a Mario game uh I'll attempt this one when I get back this will probably be the last break of the night probably go for another we'll see I'll be back and we can keep going see you in a few minutes
[306:00.12]How you doing?
[306:03.64]Let's keep going.
[306:14.28]Luigi can do the little hovering, right?
[306:22.29]He's got such a little head.
[306:28.54]Reverse what I said.
[306:43.05]This game would get me so mad.
[306:46.61]Oh, it has its moments, I think.
[306:56.46]I've gotten a little annoyed a few times, but not really.
[306:59.49]It's been very fun the whole time.
[307:05.73]Alright, come on.
[307:06.15]That's got to be it, right?
[307:11.26]There it is.
[307:15.34]I wonder what the legendary one is.
[307:16.55]This is the worst part.
[307:20.83]I hate this guy.
[307:26.46]Doesn't he follow you around?
[307:27.18]You get the key and he follows you across the whole level.
[307:36.97]You gotta go down, you grab the key, then you run away.
[307:40.75]Okay, I get it.
[307:48.13]I actually can probably jump off one of these.
[307:53.60]Yeah, for sure.
[308:18.04]That's not how you open the door!
[308:54.35]No, don't kill me.
[308:59.62]Cool.
[309:01.56]Come on, this one.
[309:03.36]Mouser.
[309:05.77]This was my favorite part of the game.
[309:10.05]This and throwing the little canisters, the little mushroom canisters at the dragon.
[309:16.44]I love this fight.
[309:17.72]I love it every time you fight Mouser.
[309:39.63]Oh shit.
[309:53.23]Get in there!
[310:25.51]Oh, that was horse shit.
[310:30.93]Sorry.
[310:40.18]No, catch.
[310:52.44]This fight kind of sucks, actually.
[311:26.21]Damn it, that would have been it.
[311:58.98]21 seconds.
[312:30.08]I need S on this one.
[312:31.00]I do need S on this one.
[312:32.80]That was close.
[312:53.34]Perfect RNG.
[312:54.04]Back into it.
[312:56.30]Yes!
[312:58.57]Excellent.
[313:02.02]Sure thing.
[313:02.73]Am I gonna do a pencil stream?
[313:28.04]What do you mean by... draw with a pencil?
[313:36.03]There's nothing worse than missing the exact frame you have to be in to hit this door.
[313:45.78]Alright, let's go.
[314:00.00]I can get up there way quicker.
[314:05.46]Are you Pennywise the clown?
[314:13.79]Not even remotely close.
[314:23.15]You're feasting on our fear right now.
[314:34.65]Excuse me, sir.
[314:37.68]Do you have Prince Albert in a can?
[314:41.30]You do?
[314:42.65]Well, you better let the poor fellow out, then.
[314:44.97]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[314:57.57]I used to think that scene was the funniest scene in the whole movie.
[315:00.07]And yes, I said funny.
[315:01.99]The way he says, excuse me, sir.
[315:03.25]He's like, excuse me, sir.
[315:04.29]And he puts his leg over the banister.
[315:08.66]A great scene.
[315:23.29]How are you supposed to jump up there and not get hit by that guy?
[315:27.61]Faster?
[315:39.14]Alright, last try.
[315:46.85]That was it, but my finger got stuck pressing hold and Y. Fuck.
[315:54.86]You know what I'm talking about when you have to hold Y to move fast and you hold it and you get... You know what I mean.
[315:59.98]It's like you're holding it down too tight.
[316:15.16]Expert button masher?
[316:16.12]Yeah, not a button presser.
[316:23.53]Take a look at the bottom of the screen.
[316:27.24]That's what I'm good at.
[316:36.69]And also when you get hit, you just stop.
[316:49.06]I hate that shit.
[316:50.04]I hate that stupid... pause everything and no inputs are... can be... I hate it.
[316:56.11]Just get up there.
[317:03.40]Jump!
[317:04.13]What are you doing?
[317:04.87]Again, my hand is locked holding down both the buttons.
[317:28.94]He hates everything.
[317:29.84]I do hate everything!
[317:33.98]Get the fuck out of this stupid-ass game.
[318:00.70]I forgot this can hurt you.
[318:04.59]You know what it is?
[318:06.44]It's floating is hold B, dash is hold Y, and jump is B. So you have to end up holding down two square word with the F-U-C-K on it, with an I-N-G at the end of it.
[318:23.70]Two buttons at the same time, and then let go one, then press it.
[318:35.83]I don't like playing this Peach Let's do something good out
[319:09.66]I would have had it.
[319:24.38]That was such a great start too.
[319:27.06]I got all three.
[319:45.78]Shit.
[319:55.81]Last one.
[320:04.94]Yay!
[320:05.04]Alright, what is a Legend Balloon Bite?
[320:13.57]Clear one with the... Okay, just do it all.
[320:19.86]We don't want cheats.
[320:27.10]It's a shit start.
[320:45.63]I gotta clean it up here.
[320:50.50]Oh, it would have been S if it was one second earlier.
[321:07.17]Shit.
[321:08.69]I'll take it.
[321:10.67]I'll take it.
[321:17.56]I didn't do any of this, really.
[321:19.02]Poor Kirby.
[321:25.03]Did this one already?
[321:27.57]I can get S on this.
[321:28.51]Come on.
[321:45.84]...
[321:52.19]Copy the enemy's special ability.
[321:53.83]Okay.
[322:07.10]I want to double tap left so bad.
[322:10.63]But it presses up half the time.
[322:19.66]Updraft.
[322:20.34]Enter the door.
[322:36.20]Why did you just speak directly into my brain?
[322:42.16]I had to.
[322:52.07]You gotta fall straight down.
[322:53.59]How did that not fit in there?
[323:06.37]Hey, play Squeak Squad and I will shave my head.
[323:09.31]Keep your hair.
[323:10.23]That's okay.
[323:16.04]What is Squeak Squad?
[323:17.04]What is that?
[323:26.62]Get the poison mushroom.
[323:31.08]Alright, we're going to do this one.
[323:31.94]I'm going to go back to one or two others and then I'm going to call it.
[323:38.23]Is Squeak Switch Sports ever going to happen again?
[323:56.01]Oh yeah.
[324:04.08]100%.
[324:04.21]Paratrooper Hoppling.
[324:06.03]Jump on the Koopa Paratrooper.
[324:07.75]That's it?
[324:12.91]play squeak squad and I'll shave that guy's head get the super mushroom where is it oh okay
[324:43.91]If I play Squeak Squad, are we gonna have like a group head shaving?
[324:48.19]Can we all just do it?
[324:53.82]I'm not shaving my head.
[324:58.06]My hair's still long.
[324:59.18]I'm not doing that.
[325:10.91]Really?
[325:16.04]I mean, I don't understand how this even works, because... Oh, okay.
[325:37.87]I did it.
[325:46.36]Get to the goal.
[325:50.01]Isn't this the actual Super Mario 2?
[325:53.96]And in North America we just called it Lost Levels.
[325:59.74]Luigi jumps a trillion feet in the air.
[326:17.46]I think you gotta go down yep
[326:52.97]I gotta get that perfect jump.
[326:59.10]Did I jump over the Goomba?
[327:04.21]No.
[327:04.57]There we go.
[327:05.17]Oh, that was it too.
[327:06.43]Shit.
[327:08.98]Annoying.
[327:10.48]Last one.
[327:25.72]Getting stuck there is like smashing your head into a cinder block.
[327:31.77]It's so annoying.
[327:33.17]All your momentum gone.
[327:34.09]Everything gone.
[327:34.77]I hate it.
[327:35.48]Goodbye.
[327:36.82]Something else.
[327:41.99]Can I unlock everything?
[327:47.86]Wait, I want to see the end of this.
[327:52.81]What is the highest possible thing in Mario 3?
[328:01.51]I love that thing.
[328:06.04]Should I spend all my money?
[328:18.49]World 1.
[328:20.55]World 1.
[328:24.51]Oh dear.
[328:28.08]Can't you just do the flute?
[328:31.92]Okay.
[328:35.63]I think I have enough money to unlock everything.
[328:37.55]What about Donkey Kong?
[328:40.23]I feel like it's a Donkey Kong kind of ending of this stream.
[328:48.54]Do it.
[328:57.39]Hammers for chumps.
[329:21.25]I don't even need to get the... Do I have to get these?
[329:45.66]I don't.
[329:46.14]Why did I just think I had to?
[329:47.06]Start the whole thing over.
[329:53.26]Just skip it all.
[329:53.92]Just run there.
[329:55.16]Let's beat the first three levels, not get the parasol.
[330:16.09]If I did have a facecam, it'd be in the right bowl square.
[330:21.07]But glass, I don't.
[330:26.01]Alright, good first round.
[330:38.05]Kind of blew it.
[330:46.04]That thing blew it!
[330:49.46]Oh, pissing me off.
[330:55.88]Fuck this.
[331:12.47]I haven't done Metroid at all.
[331:13.79]You're right, damn.
[331:16.43]Did I really skip Metroid?
[331:28.47]Okay.
[331:38.48]Quick draw.
[331:39.49]Defeat two enemies.
[331:56.18]Right one first.
[332:12.87]Maybe?
[332:16.90]Maybe not.
[332:29.20]There we go.
[332:36.09]Power grab.
[332:36.81]Get the bomb.
[332:51.69]Oh.
[332:56.39]I don't know how to pick things up
[333:24.87]Metroid Noob?
[333:26.07]Actually, yeah.
[333:29.34]I never completed this one, never did the Super Nintendo one, ever.
[333:39.83]Gate on the right wall.
[333:46.80]It's not that I didn't like the games or anything.
[333:50.56]I just kind of didn't get it.
[334:04.00]When I was a kid, I think I was just a little too stupid for it.
[334:14.76]If the game didn't go to the right, once you start introducing all the different layers and levels and stuff, and remembering where things are, no way.
[334:24.47]Not as a 10-year-old.
[334:26.70]I think I was like 9, 8 or 9 when this came out.
[334:40.03]What about Mega Man?
[334:41.15]I played Mega Man for the Game Boy, Mega Man 1, and I cannot believe that game released in the state that it released in.
[334:51.48]It is genuinely nearly incompletable.
[334:57.13]I don't know how anyone could have ever played it and beat it.
[334:59.17]I would have cried when I was younger.
[335:02.82]That's gotta be one of the most unfair games I've ever played in my whole life.
[335:05.68]Mega Man 1 for the Game Boy.
[335:07.20]It was awful.
[335:25.36]Am I missing a door or something?
[335:26.66]Did it say there's a door?
[335:29.34]Oh, I was like, what am I... I'm gonna do this one.
[335:39.39]Enter the cave.
[335:49.38]You have, like, ghosts and goblins?
[335:50.52]Yeah, that game was horrible, too.
[335:53.56]Difficulty-wise, at least.
[336:04.88]That was longer somehow.
[336:11.15]Wrong button.
[336:21.00]It tells me to press B, but B is remapped to A, and A is remapped to Y, and Y is remapped... You know what I mean.
[336:42.02]Cool.
[336:42.44]Okay.
[336:43.68]I'm going to do one more attempt at... What should I do here?
[336:55.16]One more attempt.
[337:01.22]I like this game a lot, though.
[337:01.98]This is really fun.
[337:04.49]What about King Dedede?
[337:05.45]Let's do against King Dedede.
[337:07.47]Definitely up here.
[337:08.37]I have no coins.
[337:11.57]I blew everything.
[337:18.26]I completely ran out of money.
[337:24.48]Shit.
[337:34.41]Do the multiplayer?
[337:36.37]Multiplayer was fun.
[337:36.93]I did it for... There was only a certain amount of things in the...
[337:47.70]I did spend a thousand coins on getting, I think, what, Peach?
[338:04.60]How is that slower?
[338:06.07]I can't play as Luigi.
[338:06.73]I'll do this one more time.
[339:06.03]This is the worst game ever made by the way.
[339:41.86]Thanks for watching!
[340:11.53]It's the worst game ever made.
[340:14.51]Is there a worse game that's ever been invented than Mega Man 1 for Game Boy?
[341:01.34]he's crashing out I'm fine I'm totally fine
[341:33.07]Just wait till I get to cut.
[341:38.69]I'm not even going to get to cut man, but just you go get to cut man.
[341:42.65]And when you do that, I would like for you to play it.
[341:47.18]And then after you're done, put the controller down and say, hey, that was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my life.
[342:06.24]Holly's in the chat right now.
[342:08.16]I had a generational crash out on the couch against this game.
[342:13.07]I kept turning around.
[342:14.14]She was in the other room.
[342:15.94]And I'm like, honey, can you believe this?
[342:18.34]Honey, it's unbelievable.
[342:19.28]No, it's unbelievable that you can die here.
[342:22.43]I had to rewind probably three or four thousand times to beat Cutman.
[342:28.82]Do I have a suspend point?
[342:30.10]I do.
[342:37.44]I beat him.
[342:38.45]See, I can prove it to you.
[342:39.93]I beat Cutman, and I was like, I have to suspend this, because this is fucking horseshit.
[343:03.52]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[343:13.59]Have a good rest of your evening.
[343:15.57]Have a good rest of your couple days.
[343:18.42]We will open with Oblivion on Saturday.
[343:22.86]I promise I will play Oblivion.
[343:25.59]I've wanted to.
[343:26.21]I've said I wanted to.
[343:27.11]I have a fun character.
[343:28.33]I'm ready to go.
[343:29.09]You know how it is.
[343:36.74]You know how it is.
[343:39.10]I don't know.
[343:39.38]I've missed my credit music here.
[343:48.22]Should be.
[343:53.55]Hey, there it is.
[344:00.17]Thanks for watching.
[344:00.86]Thanks for hanging out.
[344:04.04]There are 18 pages of subs.
[344:08.37]Appreciate it.
[344:08.69]Thanks, guys.
[344:12.71]I will be streaming a little bit more often over the next week here.
[344:19.55]Probably two or three times this weekend coming up.
[344:21.88]Saturday, Sunday, maybe Monday.
[344:27.46]Sunday, Monday, Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday, something like that.
[344:34.39]I'm absolutely going to be playing Night Rain.
[344:37.79]I don't think I'm going to play it at launch.
[344:40.72]I'll probably play it a few days after launch.
[344:52.65]That comes out soon.
[344:53.35]Yeah, that comes out next week.
[344:56.13]29th?
[344:56.41]30th?
[344:57.13]When does it come out?
[345:06.28]29th.
[345:11.65]Okay.
[345:26.77]Gonna slither back into the sewers.
[345:31.09]Yeah, something like that.
[345:38.14]See you soon.
[345:38.66]Take care.
[345:39.12]Thanks for watching.
[345:39.90]Call your mother.
[345:40.48]You know the deal.
[345:44.65]See you guys in a couple days.
[345:46.49]Saturday it is.
[345:47.93]Mark it on your calendar.
[345:51.78]Take care.
