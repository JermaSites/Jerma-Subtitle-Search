[06:34.62]I didn't even get to do my hair.
[06:38.04]Just moved in with my mom and I did not have a lot of friends around here.
[06:40.87]Let's take a look at the first things I learned before becoming the number one YouTuber.
[06:44.61]Who the fuck is that?
[06:50.43]Is that my mom?
[06:52.95]Use your mouse or keyboard to control the camera in your character.
[06:56.16]Rotate the camera with the middle mouse button.
[06:58.36]Oh, nice work.
[06:59.50]Look at how much of a YouTuber I am.
[07:06.26]Nice.
[07:06.56]I'm gonna do a huge deal.
[07:09.56]I don't even want these glasses either.
[07:12.90]Where's the fashion channel?
[07:14.92]During those days, I had fun making videos of the games I had in my shelf.
[07:19.88]Go to the shelf, select a video game, and a type of video.
[07:26.27]Is this... is this a shelf?
[07:28.61]Where's the shelf?
[07:30.51]That's the shelf?
[07:31.15]I have one video game?
[07:35.14]Okay, hold on a second.
[07:36.12]This fucking obnoxious ass game is so awfully loud.
[07:40.50]Like, effects.
[07:41.06]Turn these, like, down.
[07:42.60]I'm gonna, like, fucking blow my eardrums out.
[07:47.26]Oh, what did I do?
[07:48.87]Look on the question... Shit.
[07:50.33]Okay.
[07:51.39]Choose game.
[07:51.99]I have one video game.
[07:54.41]Empire Planet 2.
[07:56.77]Click on the question mark.
[07:59.45]My ears.
[08:00.07]Sorry, lolbears.
[08:01.05]I apologize.
[08:02.23]Welcome back for four months, though.
[08:05.15]Alright, so click on the question mark.
[08:07.63]Click on the question mark of type of video and select gameplay.
[08:10.71]Then click on the start video under your cover.
[08:14.83]I'm a fucking idiot.
[08:16.75]I can't even, like, read this.
[08:19.38]Start, okay, so, type of video.
[08:22.04]Wait, what?

[08:27.94]Eight months, that's an eight-monther.
[08:30.46]Appreciate it, welcome.
[08:31.28]Okay, so it's a gameplay video, so do I have to play the game?
[08:38.87]Uh... In this stage, you must configure the webcam and microphone you'll use to record the video.
[08:44.56]Your workstation has a limited amount of rendering points.
[08:47.24]Based on its components, most advanced settings will improve the quality of the video, but will use rendering points.
[08:55.11]I don't do webcams.
[08:57.17]So a microphone... Monodirectional.
[09:01.57]I've got 12 rendering points.
[09:05.04]I guess I have to do a webcam.
[09:07.48]That's what people want, right?
[09:10.58]It's still too loud.
[09:13.32]Workstation 1.
[09:18.44]Wait, I can't even?
[09:21.22]What the fuck?
[09:24.38]It costs 12 points to do this?
[09:30.42]Yeah, do it.
[09:31.60]I only have 12 points and it costs 12 to be here, I guess?
[09:34.80]Oh, no.
[09:39.01]What the fuck is going on?
[09:43.01]Okay, well, whatever.

[10:18.52]What?
[10:18.72]It's like a card game?
[10:20.34]On this stage, you face different challenges that you must solve by choosing a card.
[10:23.32]Each card uses up a certain amount of ideas.
[10:26.00]As a skill point, it generates a video clip.
[10:27.62]Choose the best cart.
[10:29.20]Use the best cart based on the situation to get as many skill points as possible.

[66:35.08]There's another person walking into my house.
[66:36.62]Oh, now he's actually coming in to harass me.
[66:41.57]He called so many times and I said no that he decided to walk in the front door.
[66:45.97]Okay.
[66:47.63]Okay, you didn't come with me to the convention.
[66:49.53]Anyway, I wanted to ask you, would you like to be my roommate?
[66:55.62]No!
[66:56.64]No!
[66:56.96]Why are they speaking in unison?
[67:02.83]Did I... You have to pay two months rent in advance?! !
[67:07.71]Did this guy just shoehorn me into... I just got shoehorned into being his roommate.
[67:14.95]I didn't want to do that.
[67:19.08]What the fuck?
[67:22.18]Okay, here it comes.
[67:24.68]Pretty good.
[67:25.14]You know, four out of five dentists recommend it.
[67:26.72]Let's see.
[67:29.93]Come on.
[67:30.61]There was so much interest in this video.
[67:32.01]I'm going to get to... There we... This is it.
[67:34.35]This is going to be the one.
[67:35.05]This is going to be it.
[67:35.59]Michael Jackson.
[67:36.33]This is it.
[67:39.28]And spread the word.
[67:41.18]He's back.
[67:44.36]This dude is back.
[67:48.93]This person's starting to scare the shit out of me.
[67:54.73]I like you, but I don't want to move forward in this relationship until we see each other in person.
[67:59.05]This guy just came to the house.
[68:02.33]This fucking guy walked in the front door.
[68:06.16]I'm not answering the phone from that guy again.
[68:08.08]I can guarantee that for sure.
[68:10.94]No way.
[68:16.22]Call the police.
[68:19.23]Yeah, $10.
[68:19.89]$10 is going to be $10.
[68:23.97]Go to sleep.
[68:25.21]Get some rest.
[68:28.45]All of you is coming hot.
[68:36.86]3700.
[68:36.90]Am I going to break 10,000?
[68:40.94]20 bucks.
[68:41.14]Go shopping.
[68:47.38]No, we're going to do it on a video.
[68:53.08]On the same... Now we did a first impression.
[68:54.88]Now we can do a gameplay.
[69:05.52]Okay, how about...
[69:08.19]30 and 2.
[69:11.05]Domination.
[69:17.53]Capture the flag.
[69:18.47]Uh, no, um... New game mode.
[69:28.94]Uh, how about... No, no, no.
[69:30.36]30 and 1.
[69:36.37]Yeah, that's a very... Look at that.
[69:38.47]That's such a generic... Great generic title.
[69:40.61]This time we're going to have a lot of good gameplay in this one.
[69:49.82]Wave hello.
[69:51.22]And then I got to get something sick.
[69:54.80]Serious comment.
[69:59.37]And then... Celebratory because we win.
[70:04.74]Nice.
[70:05.14]Times two.
[70:07.08]It's gonna be a good one.
[70:09.52]Oh, look at this.
[70:10.18]Look at this.
[70:10.96]Perfect.
[70:11.88]Perfect editing.
[70:16.44]This is gonna be a good one.
[70:18.80]Boink.
[70:22.23]Oh, baby.
[70:24.47]31 domination.
[70:28.35]You gotta get the good gameplay, right?
[70:34.00]I don't know how much longer I'm going to play this game.
[70:36.88]This is just watching the numbers go up.
[70:39.36]I don't want to go to any parties.
[70:42.98]I don't want to talk to any humans.
[70:45.44]Go back to school.
[70:48.72]I haven't been back to school in like three weeks.
[70:54.46]Okay, I guess we'll go to school.
[70:58.00]I mean, to get the achievement, that's all I care about.
[71:04.99]Just give me the achievement and give me the free shit.
[71:08.10]Nice.
[71:09.40]Thank you.
[71:11.42]Thank you.
[71:13.06]Almost at level 5.
[71:16.50]Get a new video game?
[71:17.54]Easy.
[71:20.32]You can't stop.
[71:21.98]This is your life now.
[71:25.79]Please stop playing this game.
[71:32.96]If only I could.
[71:34.50]I'm sucked in now.
[71:35.68]I have to get to 100,000 views.
[71:40.66]This one's not doing too shabby.
[71:43.69]Promote it.
[71:44.05]20 bucks.
[71:45.13]Promote it.
[71:45.69]Do I have enough for a game?
[71:46.65]Fuck.
[71:46.99]I'm an idiot.
[71:48.15]Go hang out with grandma for a little bit.
[71:51.61]Have you played Dead by Daylight?
[71:56.63]Not yet.
[71:58.31]I think the plan is we're going to play
[72:01.90]Me, Boo, Metallics, and Stealth and those guys.
[72:04.52]We're going to play it.
[72:07.24]Should be a good time.
[72:11.46]Go try to get double zero on Fallout New Vegas again.
[72:13.65]We're getting way into this.
[72:20.03]Like, I need to get to like 100,000 views on one video.
[72:24.47]Come on.
[72:27.28]What do I want to do?
[72:28.00]This one.
[72:32.05]This game sucks.
[72:34.01]Why?
[72:34.25]This game's $60 and nobody likes it.
[72:36.73]It's a piece of crap.
[72:37.43]Why would I want to buy that?
[72:47.95]Do I want to play TF2 in an hour?
[72:49.53]Uh...
[72:52.63]I'm gonna have to say 100% no.
[72:58.65]Sorry.
[73:00.07]I'm sorry, Nathan.
[73:02.13]I can't play Team Fortress right now.
[73:09.70]Look, I'm too sucked in being a YouTuber, don't you see?
[73:17.04]What does this even mean?
[73:19.40]Three additional power light bulbs?
[73:22.28]What the fuck are they talking about?
[73:27.02]Unboxed.
[73:27.84]I can actually do unboxing videos in this dumb game.
[73:30.04]Alright, we're doing it.
[73:38.20]Fistful of Frags.
[73:39.60]That was a weird way.
[73:41.64]Okay, choose game.
[73:45.60]Counter-strike.
[73:48.23]I wish I could do a walkthrough or a collab.
[73:50.38]I was going to do straight up gameplay.
[73:57.06]Okay, if we're going to do... Crouch aiming tutorial.
[74:10.93]Come God.
[74:13.46]This will get hit.
[74:21.58]It actually showed.
[74:30.22]There's nobody to destroy, unfortunately.
[74:33.35]Scumbag Stanley.
[74:34.49]Sorry, there's no one for me to destroy.
[74:37.47]But... Thank you, regardless.
[74:41.33]Welcome to the family.
[74:46.68]Oh, shit.
[74:47.88]I really fucked this up.
[74:57.05]No, why does everybody want to use my computer?
[75:00.48]Get out of my house.
[75:03.98]Destroy this game.
[75:11.01]Look at how good my performances are.
[75:12.91]I do great performances.
[75:14.01]Hi, I'm your father.
[75:17.31]Oops, sorry, wrong apartment.
[75:18.59]I see you have a lot of things around here.
[75:20.40]Would you give me your green carpet so I can give it to my actual son?
[75:27.63]No, I'm sure... What are you talking about?
[75:35.15]Somebody rang the doorbell and said, I'm your dad.
[75:37.73]No, sorry, I'm not your dad.
[75:39.02]Can I have the green carpet in your room?
[75:47.06]You're not... This was like 30 bucks.
[75:51.38]Listen to me, son.
[75:52.72]I'm your dad.
[75:54.34]What?
[75:57.01]That would be so funny if that played right there.
[75:58.99]I don't really like my crouch aiming tutorial.
[76:09.29]Apparently they did.
[76:09.99]Link of Giants.
[76:18.83]I'm starting to not like... I'm starting to not have fun anymore.
[76:22.02]This is just boring.
[76:25.46]But I have to continue to play it.
[76:27.18]Okay, enter the name of the video.
[76:31.18]What is this?
[76:31.60]League of Legends?
[76:50.31]A drinking game.
[76:58.34]There.
[77:00.10]That's a character, right?
[77:01.04]In League of Legends.
[77:02.60]Teemo.
[77:06.43]Yo, what's going on, everybody?
[77:07.95]Every time Teemo gets a kill or an assist, we gotta take a shot of vodka.
[77:13.39]Sarcastic.
[77:18.01]Dude, what happened?
[77:18.87]Teemo didn't get a kill?
[77:20.19]Oh, you know, drinking for you, dude.
[77:22.41]Sorry.
[77:27.90]Stop doing this, this is bad.
[77:30.88]Oh, God.
[77:31.46]Uh... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[77:44.77]I mean, it's not... Can I fix this somehow?
[77:49.13]Now, who gives a shit?
[77:50.25]Red jacket, gold jacket, green jacket, who gives a shit?
[77:57.88]Dude, come on.
[78:02.90]Just like real YouTube.
[78:05.60]What happened to Empire Planet 2?
[78:07.04]I don't know.
[78:11.53]Yeah, yeah, ma.
[78:14.87]Get out of here, ma.
[78:22.31]Drinking game.
[78:23.17]Am I making it big?
[78:27.54]Copyrighted music clip.
[78:30.68]Why would I want to use that?
[78:33.26]Seems like a terrible idea.
[78:39.36]Oh, so Dunkin Donuts.
[78:46.05]Money comes real slow.
[78:55.49]All my money is going towards repairing this stupid computer.
[79:02.19]Yeah, I haven't been to school in like three months, you're right.
[79:04.89]Maybe even longer than that.
[79:07.51]You know, I could go to school now.
[79:09.07]There.
[79:09.91]There you go, Ma.
[79:12.94]Who edited this video?
[79:13.96]Haha.
[79:14.34]Dear God, you shouldn't turn on your camera to record something like this.
[79:17.52]Fuck off.
[79:19.94]Very interesting.
[79:21.36]Best game I've ever played.
[79:22.42]Nice.
[79:26.16]That's a 164.6 dislikes.
[79:27.48]That's not bad.
[79:28.42]Come on.
[79:30.68]Video quality was terrible.
[79:31.80]I was recording it over my shoulder with a handy cam, but you know.
[79:35.40]Sometimes you gotta make do with what you got, you know?
[79:45.07]Alright.
[79:45.67]Let's go with another video.
[79:47.01]I've got a video for you.
[79:50.10]I've got a video for you.
[79:51.80]This will get a fucking million views.
[79:54.99]Planet Wars 2.
[79:56.94]Straight up gameplay.
[79:58.82]No.
[80:00.84]Yeah, this shit don't even matter, you know what I'm saying?
[80:03.10]Doesn't even fucking matter.
[80:03.88]We're gonna get a bunch of views.
[80:28.92]There you go.
[80:36.96]Let's see.
[80:38.56]Let's see what this does.
[80:46.48]I'd watch this.
[80:47.64]I have to wave hello in the video.
[80:49.26]Hi, guys.
[80:51.38]So, my nude photos got leaked.
[80:54.06]Oh, I wish we were going to be real sarcastic about it.
[80:57.46]Too bad.
[81:00.28]And then I start to sing.
[81:01.22]And then I do a funny comment.
[81:06.76]It could happen to the best of us, you know?
[81:08.31]Well, what good editing.
[81:14.93]Look at this.
[81:15.31]A perfect video.
[81:17.41]Perfect.
[81:17.85]I'm going to do soft focus.
[81:23.32]A lot of... I like a solid D for interest.
[81:32.79]Alright, let's go.
[81:34.31]Publish.
[81:39.17]This one's not doing that great.
[81:40.37]Come on.
[81:41.93]We're stepping up another step if this doesn't work.
[81:52.01]Turn this shit off.
[81:54.81]I tell you, once I get a viral video, that's when I've won the game and I can stop playing it.
[82:03.46]Can I make my internet better?
[82:04.66]I gotta change my clothes too.
[82:12.15]I look like a fucking idiot.
[82:15.49]This game actually sucks.
[82:20.18]Isn't this an experience though?
[82:24.22]Isn't it fun to see what it is?
[82:25.88]There we go.
[82:37.95]Dude, only one person didn't like it.
[82:39.63]62 bucks?
[82:43.91]Come on, go viral.
[82:45.68]Go viral.
[82:47.34]Ah, let's go promote it.
[82:48.42]We're gonna promote it, too.
[82:49.76]Everyone's gonna be talking about it.
[82:52.24]Like, did you see how small his package was?
[82:55.36]Like, I can't believe it.
[82:58.55]Can you, like, even imagine?
[83:00.19]Like, I would suck to be him.
[83:01.89]Yeah, that's what these comments are saying.
[83:14.78]How accurate is this compared to your daily life?
[83:17.60]Just pretty accurate.
[83:19.50]Except not really.
[83:24.25]Go to work again.
[83:28.97]No.
[83:29.45]Sorry, Jonah.
[83:30.63]See ya.
[83:42.88]out of here.
[83:43.38]Alright, fuck it.
[83:43.96]Hold on.
[83:44.88]Yeah, let's go to the movies.
[83:47.02]Let's go to the movies.
[83:49.24]We're gonna do something else.
[83:50.81]I'm gonna wear a nice pair of jeans.
[83:52.55]Nice white tee.
[83:54.77]Brown sneaks.
[83:56.51]Get these glasses off.
[83:59.83]Take that hat off.
[84:00.49]It's really nice.
[84:00.95]Here, go to the event.
[84:01.61]Go to the movies.
[84:02.11]Let's go.
[84:06.70]This is gonna be so much fun.
[84:07.60]It's gonna be a new area for the first time in like an hour.
[84:12.18]For this to be accurate, it needs to be 100% more Tinder.
[84:16.35]Here we go, we're at the movies again.
[84:17.55]Get five phone numbers in four minutes.
[84:23.23]How can I not move?
[84:24.53]What the hell am I doing?
[84:30.85]What is that?
[84:31.32]Are they playing, like, dominoes?
[84:36.98]What are you guys looking at?
[84:37.68]Why is there just a piece of paper folded on here?
[84:40.67]Hold on a second.
[84:42.15]Crystal.
[84:43.07]I want to talk to Crystal.
[84:43.77]I got to see her profile.
[84:44.49]Does she have any subs?
[84:45.67]How many viewers does she have?
[84:47.71]Doesn't even have any viewers?
[84:50.49]See you later.
[84:54.40]You know how many subscribers I have now?
[84:55.92]I have 10,000 subs.
[84:57.18]You're not even worth my fucking time.
[84:59.18]What about you?
[85:00.84]Oh.
[85:01.90]Not even one sub.
[85:03.38]See ya.
[85:03.64]What about you?
[85:11.71]None of you guys are even worth me talking to.
[85:13.63]I guess I'm talking to her.
[85:26.33]This is dumb.
[85:27.83]This is real dumb.
[85:30.69]I gotta find another... Oh, this guy's definitely a YouTuber.
[85:33.09]You can tell.
[85:33.58]He's got the shades on.
[85:35.86]He looks totally cool.
[85:38.84]Wow, no, he's just a fuckface.
[85:40.60]Never mind.
[85:42.50]God, I'm just the most popular person in this room.
[85:44.64]It's so hard to be this popular.
[85:46.60]What about you, green hair?
[85:50.86]You definitely have a YouTube channel if you have different colored hair.
[85:53.62]No, no you don't.
[85:57.04]What is this?
[85:58.26]Post for the press?
[86:01.90]Get the fuck out of my photo!
[86:05.73]Thank you, you can get out.
[86:06.69]You're not very famous yet.
[86:10.63]What?
[86:12.67]Did I just get booted?
[86:13.89]You've unlocked a new video type.
[86:15.23]Wait, what?
[86:16.81]Yeah, what?
[86:19.59]Moss just resubscribed for two months.
[86:22.96]Thank you, Moss.
[86:26.50]Looks like I can do vlogs now.
[86:28.00]Okay.
[86:28.34]I'm just in all this.
[86:34.96]I'm not gonna move.
[86:36.21]You're gonna have to fucking drag me by my hair out of here.
[86:42.97]Why is he taking pictures of these guys?
[86:45.93]They don't even have any channels.
[86:48.75]Have you seen my Legends of Leagues gameplay video?
[86:52.26]That had over 22,000 views?
[86:52.98]This game sucks.
[87:13.79]Alright, let's go back.
[87:16.29]Hold on.
[87:25.89]10k.
[87:26.89]10k special is you exit the game.
[87:28.93]Alright, what else have we got?
[87:37.26]What else am I going to play?
[87:38.62]Let's see.
[87:40.74]Could go back in Fallout for a little bit.
[87:43.80]How long was I streaming that game?
[87:44.98]Because it felt like four hours.
[87:50.60]Oh, whoops.
[87:51.12]No, yeah.
[87:51.68]I'm going to be right back.
[87:52.37]We're going to switch games.
[87:54.29]I want to know how long I played that game for.
[87:55.81]Because it seriously felt like four or five hours.
[87:59.39]It was what?
[87:59.93]Like maybe 30 minutes?
[88:04.21]Two hours?
[88:05.39]An hour and a half?
[88:07.25]Alright.
[88:09.84]We'll go back and play some New Vegas for a little bit.
[88:15.24]Or maybe if I have an epiphany while I'm getting tea and peeing.
[88:19.24]We'll find out.
[88:20.64]But that was YouTuber's life.
[88:24.08]You know, your time is probably better off spent actually making a YouTube video than pretend making a YouTube video.
[88:34.37]Like, we've gotten to a point in, like, this society here in this industry where making a game where you pretend to be a person, making a video, playing a game, is a real odd time in history.
[88:54.92]It's real odd.
[88:57.44]But I will be back in, like, maybe two or three minutes.
[89:04.50]I will see you guys in a minute.
[89:06.91]You're going to get a nice tunes of this game.
[89:09.35]Be right back.
[90:49.74]you
[91:34.37]Okay.
[91:36.31]So we're going to do strawpole.
[91:38.74]I'll make it right now.
[91:42.36]Strawpole.
[91:46.85]Strawpole dot me.
[91:48.15]Okay.
[91:51.73]What?
[91:53.75]Game.
[91:54.81]You can pick one of these options.
[92:05.36]I still haven't done this yet either.
[92:17.14]Followed in Vegas.
[92:18.30]Overwatch ranked placement matches.
[92:26.75]Okay.
[92:29.91]Go here and do some voting.
[92:37.00]Do some voting right here.
[92:43.30]Do some voting there.
[92:47.30]Alright.
[92:52.43]Give that a minute or two to get going.
[92:56.49]Mario 64.
[93:01.61]Oh, man.
[93:03.01]Dear God.
[93:03.81]Anything else, really?
[93:04.79]People don't... Okay.
[93:07.32]Dear God.
[93:08.46]Anything else?
[93:09.12]What is anything else?
[93:11.32]Shovel Knight?
[93:13.74]Oh, boy.
[93:14.27]It's close.
[93:15.09]It's real close.
[93:25.77]He gave him the option.
[93:26.70]Well, I wanted to see if it was just like, follow New Vegas, Overwatch, or I fucking hate both of those things.
[93:31.70]Don't do either one.
[93:34.02]And, I mean, I preface it, but, you know, dear God, anything else usually means, dear God, I don't want to watch either of the two things that you just asked.
[93:48.03]I'm literally going to just scroll down, if it's anything else, and pick a random game to play.
[93:53.13]I don't know what the hell it's going to be.
[93:55.95]But we are very close.
[94:00.66]I would cast your vote because it's too close to call at the moment.
[94:07.90]Minesweeper.
[94:12.37]My god have mercy on us.
[94:25.47]Oh, it looks like Fallout New Vegas is starting to climb ahead.
[94:34.57]Close though.
[94:36.87]Really close.
[94:43.73]Flash games.
[94:46.86]I've been asked to play Bad Rats like maybe 500 million times.
[94:54.38]But it hasn't... You've already seen a bunch of people do that.
[95:00.05]Like, that's a thing everyone's already seen.
[95:02.17]Like, a hundred times.
[95:05.67]I'm gonna do another vote without... Okay, so we've eliminated Overwatch.
[95:09.73]Okay?
[95:11.55]That's what we'll do.
[95:12.05]So here you go.
[95:14.61]Here's the random game that I just looked at and that, like, I just literally fucking just looked at with my two eyes.
[95:21.68]And we'll see what happens.
[95:24.69]Here comes a new pull.
[95:27.89]I just set it out loud.
[95:29.57]This is the next pull.
[95:34.84]I've played like 30 minutes of this game.
[95:37.14]That's going to be awful.
[95:39.66]But this is the random game.
[95:47.43]Great pull.
[95:48.01]Here you go.
[95:50.91]This one, this one, we'll see.
[95:52.61]This is the game that's going to be played.
[95:56.89]Fallout New Vegas or Shovel Knight.
[95:59.35]Which one?
[96:01.79]I just randomly looked at it like a minute ago and said it.
[96:09.11]Welcome to the poll stream.
[96:19.79]Shovel Knight.
[96:24.37]Alright, looks like we're playing Fallout.
[96:32.89]Yeah, Fallout 1, pretty much by a landslide.
[96:38.92]Okay, do another poll without Shovel Knight, just to be sure.
[96:41.52]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[96:45.67]We're going to just muck about, fuck around New Vegas for like 30 or 40 minutes.
[96:50.73]And then we'll play Shovel Knight for like 40 minutes.
[96:52.98]And then I'm done.
[96:54.16]I'm gonna go to bed.
[96:56.56]I'll try to get double zero a few times, yeah.
[96:59.34]Alright, poll's closed.
[97:00.66]We're done.
[97:01.94]Let's go play Fallout New Vegas.
[97:06.01]For just a little bit.
[97:07.57]Just a little bit.
[97:10.65]Fallout New Vegas.
[97:17.25]Okay, that's updated.
[97:21.88]Thank you for bearing with me here while I change games.
[97:28.74]Okay, YouTube simulator, you're going to have to fucking die.
[97:31.31]Go away.
[97:31.79]Okay, hold on.
[97:37.17]Starting soon.
[97:38.03]Just a second here.
[97:39.31]I'm going to follow New Vegas.
[97:44.37]So we have a strict time limit on Fallout New Vegas of 45 minutes, okay?
[97:48.69]Somebody keep track.
[97:51.43]I hope someone's keeping track.
[97:54.01]Just gamble for a half an hour.
[97:57.45]That would be kind of funny.
[97:59.39]Just open up a fresh beer.
[98:07.95]It's actually a nice tea.
[98:16.43]What the hell was I doing?
[98:19.21]I know I was gambling until I remember.
[98:20.63]I gotta leave the casino.
[98:30.37]This changed the scene to Fallout New Vegas.
[98:38.14]And we should be ready to go.
[98:44.14]Okay.
[98:46.60]Okay.
[98:48.76]Hi.
[98:53.23]I didn't know you could do, like, Mortal Kombat uppercuts.
[98:57.67]Hey, where's Otto?
[99:04.66]Otto, Otto, Otto, Otto, Otto.
[99:11.89]Why not Fallout 4?
[99:12.99]Because I never played Fallout New Vegas before.
[99:16.14]What the fuck are you looking at?
[99:17.38]What the fuck?
[99:19.52]Okay.
[99:20.38]What was it?
[99:20.96]How much money do I have?
[99:29.84]I'm not doing this again.
[99:31.89]I'm getting out of here.
[99:32.99]I'm not doing this again.
[99:37.55]Not doing... Auto cam?
[99:38.85]He's not even in here.
[99:39.65]I don't know where he is.
[99:40.23]I think he's upstairs.
[99:48.72]Get out of the way, Moopette.
[99:54.78]Okay, 1-0, I don't, whatever, I don't care.
[99:56.42]Double zero.
[100:00.48]Oh!
[100:02.38]It was close!
[100:03.34]It was close.
[100:04.24]It was so close.
[100:05.74]Come on.
[100:07.26]It so badly wanted to go in there.
[100:08.86]You guys saw how close that was.
[100:12.24]You have to do it again.
[100:12.93]I can't believe that shit.
[100:24.06]Okay, for real, I'm only doing this maybe like six or seven more times.
[100:32.18]Only five to six more times.
[100:43.45]Get on there.
[100:48.37]Shoot the casino manager.
[100:49.61]No!
[100:50.27]I need to win... Ugh.
[100:54.73]I love how we're cutting into our Fallout New Vegas time with this total dog shit.
[101:03.86]Alright, now we're at, like, three to four more times, right?
[101:08.56]Two to three more times.
[101:09.36]I mean, the probability is, what, 1 in 35?
[101:21.91]It's really not that huge of a probability.
[101:24.80]It's a chance.
[101:26.04]You know what I was trying to say.
[101:28.32]35.
[101:28.34]Okay, one to two more times.
[101:36.86]There it is.
[101:37.26]No, it's not.
[101:40.26]One to two more times.
[101:44.46]And then we're out.
[101:52.79]0 to 1 more times.
[101:56.43]Double 0 more times.
[102:02.83]0 to 1 more times.
[102:10.10]0 to 0 more times.
[102:12.14]This is the last one.
[102:12.84]We're done.
[102:13.50]This is it.
[102:15.32]This is it.
[102:17.82]Double 0.
[102:18.14]0 to 0.
[102:22.70]Get the fuck out of here.
[102:30.98]Game crashed.
[102:37.30]Game crashed.
[102:39.43]Come on.
[102:40.99]Get me... Why?
[102:44.23]What the fuck did I do?
[102:47.09]Get... Get off the screen.
[102:49.47]Aye, aye, aye.
[102:54.01]Hey, it's like it never happened.
[102:55.03]Okay, so I went back.
[103:11.52]Technically, I haven't spent that money, so we're going to do it again.
[103:26.94]Can't leave till I get... This has never happened in a YouTuber's life.
[103:29.56]No, it didn't.
[103:30.16]You're right.
[103:34.29]There's some... What happened?
[103:37.41]We got 5600?
[103:39.85]This is it.
[103:40.69]Done.
[103:41.83]I said 0 to 0 more times.
[103:46.13]We're done.
[103:48.21]Bye.
[103:53.93]And you guys wanted me to change to Fallout New Vegas.
[103:58.34]This is what you got when I changed.
[104:01.10]This trash.
[104:13.17]Single zero this time.
[104:23.85]Yeah, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[104:26.29]Cash out.
[104:28.85]Cash out after I pull the slot machine like fucking ten times.
[104:32.77]Hey motherfuckers.
[104:42.10]From one game to the next.
[104:48.90]This is why I voted for New Vegas.
[104:52.60]Still more fun than YouTuber's life.
[104:59.69]One big hit, and I'm out.
[105:05.41]Guys, don't you know I won $1,000 on the Ellen DeGeneres slot machine?
[105:14.61]I got the luck.
[105:19.96]Come on.
[105:31.24]Dude, I lost audio.
[105:34.56]My game is freaking out right now.
[105:35.74]It doesn't know when to play sounds.
[105:37.22]Maybe that's a good thing.
[105:42.76]Okay, good.
[105:43.54]We're done.
[105:44.36]Cash out.
[105:44.86]Get me out of here and let's play the fucking game.
[105:46.72]Bye.
[105:47.88]Goodbye.
[105:56.71]How much money do I have now?
[106:00.13]5,000 caps?
[106:00.89]Okay.
[106:01.79]Sounds like a plan.
[106:03.25]Good.
[106:04.25]Bye.
[106:04.53]What was I doing?
[106:07.53]Let's go spread the word of the Legion's atrocities.
[106:10.70]Where is that?
[106:13.48]Game crashed.
[106:16.68]It doesn't want me to leave the casino!
[106:19.64]It doesn't want me to leave the casino!
[106:23.82]It keeps wanting me to come back to the casino and fucking gamble!
[106:30.48]Minister Moo, thank you for two months.
[106:34.82]Thank you for two months, I can never leave.
[106:38.48]Why?
[106:38.94]I just want to play the game.
[106:41.46]It keeps sucking me back in.
[106:51.95]God damn.
[106:56.63]Now we're not gambling at all.
[106:58.11]I'm walking out of the casino, just leaving.
[107:03.52]I ain't playing this shit no more.
[107:05.85]Oh, ow!
[107:06.69]Get me out of the casino.
[107:16.65]Get.
[107:17.39]Me.
[107:18.57]Out.
[107:23.23]Goodbye.
[107:28.21]Just walk out the front door.
[107:32.99]Gotta get you- I do have to get my money.
[107:34.71]Shit.
[107:45.14]Okay, play it calm.
[107:47.20]On the way to the cash out there is a slot machine that I can get on.
[107:54.60]Self-control.
[107:56.31]Self-control.
[107:57.53]Don't look at the slot machine.
[108:00.53]One hand of blackjack, just one.
[108:02.96]One hand.
[108:05.06]Double down.
[108:07.83]Okay, go.
[108:08.39]Get me out.
[108:08.77]Go.
[108:09.05]I win.

[108:36.75]No!
[108:38.47]I surrender.
[108:39.11]I surrender.
[108:40.31]I so badly want to punch this guy.
[108:46.48]Alright, get me out.
[108:49.80]Get me my cap.
[108:52.52]Get me my cap.
[108:53.96]Get me my cap.

[113:41.23]Is it going to spread the pheromones?
[113:44.45]What is it?
[113:44.83]Pheromones?
[113:48.22]I'm gonna get swarmed.
[113:49.02]Okay.
[113:49.26]What is this?
[113:49.70]Okay.
[114:13.23]If you start working against us or become an enemy, our deal ends.
[114:17.08]Oh, wait.
[114:18.14]He's talking about... This guy's in the Legion.
[114:20.44]This guy's in the Legion.
[114:24.12]You're running way too fast.
[114:27.42]Wait, what?
[114:28.78]What is this?
[114:33.06]Fuck the Legion.
[114:35.90]Watch this one.
[114:37.32]Now he's running.
[114:38.12]He's bloodied.
[114:40.10]No, I gotta get the kill.
[114:40.80]It's my kill.
[114:41.46]Watch out, you dumb fucking ant.
[114:44.28]I wanted to get an exploding head kill.
[114:47.70]Get back here.
[114:50.32]Get back here.
[114:50.81]He's gonna die by one of these ants.
[114:53.45]He's gonna get touched once and die.
[114:55.05]See?
[114:56.81]Oh, come on.
[114:57.51]That's my kill.
[115:00.49]How is he still alive?
[115:03.91]That was mine!
[115:04.77]Ah, now I gotta take on the fucking legion of ants.
[115:12.66]Ah, squash it, bugs!
[115:23.49]There we go.
[115:24.99]It's like I did it.
[115:30.86]Where was that cache?
[115:35.46]Spaceship!
[115:36.64]Why wasn't the spaceship?
[115:43.65]This reminds me, what's that game?
[115:49.49]EDF?
[115:50.07]Earth Defense Force.
[115:50.76]I feel like that's what I'm playing right now.
[115:56.40]No!
[115:57.42]No!
[115:58.44]The game's crashing.
[116:00.52]No, thank god.
[116:01.48]Save it.
[116:01.93]Right now.
[116:02.27]Before I have a meltdown.
[116:09.25]The answer and the legion too.
[116:19.09]Legion of Doom.
[116:26.18]How close am I?
[116:29.14]I have to be getting close.
[116:33.65]I love how I'm going here to talk about the Legion's atrocities.
[116:36.55]And I committed those atrocities when I was part of the Legion.
[116:39.91]What am I going to do?
[116:40.40]Turn myself in?
[116:41.40]Put my hands up and say cuff me?
[116:46.86]Hey guys, I came all the way from across the whole desert to tell you.
[116:50.52]It was me.
[116:54.00]They're all empty.
[116:59.76]Almost there.
[117:03.72]Almost there.
[117:09.55]Holy shit.
[117:12.81]Those things aren't alive, are they?
[117:18.14]Is it like George Washington shaking hands with Theodore Roosevelt?
[117:21.60]What is that?
[117:26.12]I've traveled many miles to tell you that I'm an asshole.
[117:28.22]Good day.
[117:28.78]Yeah.
[117:29.24]That's pretty much what I'm doing.
[117:30.14]I think I made it.
[117:38.67]Yeah.
[117:40.01]Cool.
[117:41.93]Hey!
[117:42.19]It is crazy.
[117:48.86]What a tattletale.
[117:49.58]Legions attack, I have to burn and kill everyone.
[117:50.82]No, they did it.
[117:51.18]I miss a YouTuber's life.
[117:53.94]You're like one of the only ones.
[117:55.24]Is that all I did?
[117:55.70]Are you serious?
[118:19.14]I have to do it.
[118:27.39]I was told to do it.
[118:29.63]By Spooks.
[118:31.91]I have to destroy this whole town because he just told me to.
[118:33.87]Hold on.
[118:34.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[118:35.07]Before I do that.
[118:38.57]Anyways, welcome Spooks.
[118:40.62]Thank you for subscribing.
[118:44.57]I just gotta have a BMX helmet on.
[118:45.99]Why do you have this on?
[118:46.71]Destroy him!
[119:16.88]Oh my god.
[119:17.80]That was terrible.
[119:25.48]I'm gonna go to sleep in his bed.
[119:28.66]Aww.
[119:29.74]Okay, alright, alright.
[119:33.71]Have fun for a second.
[119:34.65]Let's go.
[119:39.99]Unpopped Bubblicious Helmet?
[119:45.93]That's all I could do here?
[119:49.18]I ran across the whole desert just to have a guy say, thanks.
[119:54.08]Thanks for telling me that.
[119:56.24]Bye.
[120:04.14]Should I just go find this?
[120:05.18]It's free stuff, right?
[120:07.46]Where would it be?
[120:10.91]It's all the way over here.
[120:11.81]Well, I'm right there.
[120:13.05]I'm right here.
[120:16.63]Not a big deal.
[120:19.28]Not a big deal, you know?
[120:22.22]That's no big deal.
[120:25.30]Scotch is warmed up and we're gonna drink some of that shit.
[120:35.32]Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.
[120:37.39]Wine, wine, some more wine.
[120:38.87]Whiskey.
[120:47.47]Where's this cash?
[120:56.46]Well, thanks a lot, Walter.
[120:57.56]I appreciate it.
[121:01.65]That's very nice of you to say.
[121:06.77]I'm going to get ambushed here, aren't I?
[121:14.11]Kind of feel like it.
[121:15.33]I'm gonna get double-crossed.
[121:17.47]But I did blow that guy's head up, so I'm sure they're... There they are.
[121:20.66]Look at this.
[121:21.46]Oh, that was free shit.
[121:26.90]Oh, it's just useless Legion money.
[121:30.06]What am I gonna do with this?
[121:34.32]Can you give me something that's worth anything?
[121:37.16]Oh, my God.
[121:38.28]That's a lot of doctor's bags.
[121:42.82]Ooh.
[121:44.04]Ooh.
[121:46.02]Hold on a second.
[121:48.38]Thank you, Caesar.
[121:49.68]Do I look like a badass?
[122:08.27]Might be time to drop.
[122:09.11]No, this is eight?
[122:10.87]How is this better?
[122:13.35]How the fuck is a dumb spacesuit better?
[122:17.87]This weighs 30.
[122:18.93]Get the fuck out of here.
[122:23.51]The spacesuit helmet even is better, too.
[122:25.05]Are you serious?
[122:31.39]Give me a break.
[122:38.43]Can I, like, repair it?
[122:41.55]Hold on.
[122:44.70]Metal helmet.
[122:47.28]Where is it?
[122:47.54]Where'd it go?
[122:49.04]No, I'm stealing it, apparently.
[122:54.75]No, that wasn't the right one.
[122:57.51]Where the fuck did I go?
[123:00.59]Metal armor.
[123:07.45]Do I have to bring it somewhere?
[123:09.27]I kind of don't want to do all that dumb crap.
[123:14.55]Weighs too much.
[123:16.45]And I can't repair it, so... See you later.
[123:19.41]See you later.
[123:22.09]Guess we're gonna go back to the spacesuit.
[123:31.56]How am I still over-encumbered?
[123:35.82]Game sucks.
[123:45.33]Well, there's more gambling money, like somebody said.
[123:46.81]Now what the hell am I supposed to do?
[123:51.16]My kind of... Alright, we're gonna do... Wild card.
[124:06.02]So I can go to... I remember I had trouble with this one because I just didn't know what the hell to do.
[124:11.76]I'm just gonna go to wherever I'm gonna go.
[124:13.34]This is where I'm gonna go.
[124:17.67]So, let's see.
[124:21.33]Which one of these three?
[124:22.21]Whatever's closest.
[124:24.95]Looks like I'm closest to here.
[124:28.97]So we're just going to go with that way.
[124:30.65]Whatever that is.
[124:31.41]You have five minutes.
[124:37.86]Five minutes until Shovel Knight.
[124:39.12]Did you guys just hear that?
[124:46.74]I was about to laugh, and I didn't laugh, so it went... I don't have much time.
[124:55.79]It's almost time to play the other game.
[124:58.85]Going up here.
[125:13.20]There it is.
[125:15.30]Let's get a save file here.
[125:17.32]We got a bunch of fucking... We got a bunch of... We got a bunch of fucking hobos.
[125:25.60]Fuck you, you fucking hobo.
[125:28.30]Get on a train and ride it somewhere.
[125:40.78]Getting closer.
[125:44.63]Got a green hobo.
[125:49.48]And you little dog, too!
[125:50.44]Ew!
[125:55.46]Gross!
[126:02.81]What game is next?
[126:04.03]Shovel Knight.
[126:05.69]For like 30 minutes.
[126:16.14]Am I going to get sick from breathing in this air?
[126:22.14]This air looks pretty smoggy.
[126:23.34]I don't know if I should be breathing this in.
[126:28.39]What?
[126:29.53]What?
[126:30.05]Wait.
[126:30.63]Wait, where am I?
[126:32.87]Oh.
[126:33.75]At the first second, I thought I was there.
[126:37.06]Oh, we can just go here.
[126:45.15]Friendlies whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait spam Yeah, tell your friends they call me wild Willy I
[127:12.31]Okay, so right up here.
[127:14.35]Actually, this is a little closer, I think.
[127:17.79]Good springs.
[127:22.98]Button masher.
[127:23.82]Oh, look who it is!
[127:26.52]Look who it is!
[127:27.82]I can't believe it!
[127:29.83]It's been so long since I've seen you.
[127:35.27]Go, run.
[127:40.70]Get out.
[127:41.78]Get out before anyone knows.
[127:48.50]Quick, get away.
[127:57.54]Am I going in the right direction?
[127:59.24]Yeah.
[128:01.24]I'm gonna go that way.
[128:06.89]Easy Pete, you all wanted me to kill Easy Pete so bad.
[128:09.57]And I did it.
[128:11.21]There you go.
[128:17.97]Keep out.
[128:19.57]Stay out of here.
[128:20.31]Maybe I should take a stimpiek.
[128:30.41]No, I'll drink a little whiskey.
[128:32.85]Some wine, and some devil eggs, and some wine, and some vodka, and some turbo.
[128:37.69]And some sarsaparilla.
[128:48.93]Oh!
[128:50.01]I just turned green.
[128:50.93]Okay.
[128:59.46]Okay.
[129:01.64]Couple of bugs.
[129:02.64]No biggie.
[129:07.16]It hurt a lot.
[129:09.06]Oh god.
[129:14.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[129:17.52]Oh my god.
[129:18.24]Oh my god.
[129:20.54]I did not think they were this dangerous.
[129:28.48]I'm so scared now.
[129:30.56]I'm terrified.
[129:39.36]Yikes.
[129:41.06]Are there two in there?
[129:50.88]There's two in there.
[129:53.54]Right?
[129:55.86]Ah.
[129:58.02]My god.
[129:58.75]I'm a little woozy.
[130:00.01]That's not good.
[130:01.13]I'm going to make this woozy just go away.
[130:09.84]What is hurting me?
[130:14.08]Give me a doctor's bag.
[130:16.62]No, it didn't do anything.
[130:24.09]What the fuck?
[130:29.47]Am I just poisoned?
[130:31.23]Why am I poisoned?
[130:33.65]This is murdering me.
[130:35.39]This is literally murdering me.
[130:37.63]I'm gonna die of poison.
[130:40.44]Do I have anything that counteracts this?
[130:47.98]Do I have any, like, anti-venom?
[130:49.86]I have ant meat.
[130:54.87]Ant egg.
[130:57.27]Uh... Blood pack.
[131:01.41]A couple of steaks, some ground beef.
[131:05.77]Some fruits, apples, some dirty water.
[131:22.48]Whitney, quick!
[131:32.41]Shit.
[131:34.41]Oh no, I'm back here!
[132:02.46]Get me out of here.
[132:03.98]I'm using this thing.
[132:10.94]Put it away so I can run.
[132:14.46]Okay, note to self.
[132:20.52]I'm not going that way.
[132:23.12]I need to go
[132:26.49]I'm gonna go this way, like around this way.
[132:31.36]So we're gonna wrap around here.
[132:43.33]We're avoiding those stupid bugs.
[132:46.09]We're going to go a safer way.
[132:47.73]I'm not going to get attacked by a fucking bug colony of poison sickos.
[132:55.85]Yeah, poor EZP.
[132:56.65]That's the second time.
[132:57.41]So I'm gonna go like that way.
[133:16.12]Oh, come on!
[133:16.86]What the fuck?
[133:20.20]No, don't...
[133:24.00]He's like one-hit killing me.
[133:25.46]He two-hitted me.
[133:26.52]He two-hitted me.
[133:27.55]He gave me a one, two, and I'm already dead.
[133:32.27]Just fucking run.
[133:33.13]Put it away and run.
[133:33.69]Oh, shit.
[133:35.77]That's the exact place I just was.
[133:37.93]I'm poisoned.
[133:41.28]I'm poisoned.
[133:41.80]I'm poisoned.
[133:42.14]I'm poisoned.
[133:45.96]I'm not gonna move.
[133:47.32]What a bad place to go.
[133:49.76]I'm dying.
[133:50.76]Oh, for the love of fucking God.
[133:58.87]No, what did I just... I'm, like, invincible?
[134:06.32]Uh... Well... Get to kill Easy Pete again.
[134:16.70]Hey, fancy meeting you here, Easy Pete.
[134:19.28]How are you?
[134:26.28]Got any last words?
[134:28.51]Howdy.
[134:32.17]For Pete's sake.
[134:35.17]Oh, is it... Hold on, it's out of bullets.
[134:38.21]This one's out of bullets.
[134:39.78]Oh, that's really, really...
[134:56.77]He's still alive?
[135:01.32]You're dead!
[135:02.44]What the fuck?
[135:04.32]He's... I'm trying... It finally killed him.
[135:13.51]What do you got?
[135:13.87]Give me everything.
[135:19.17]Now I'm like missing health already.
[135:20.95]Come on.
[135:23.63]Howdy.
[135:31.83]Okay.
[135:33.29]Let me just take a stim pack.
[135:35.79]Put on my incinerator.
[135:37.53]No.
[135:38.88]Yeah.
[135:41.94]We're gonna go... I'm just gonna go the other way.
[135:44.20]We're going all the way around.
[135:47.54]Like, what's right here?
[135:49.86]Whatever's right there is what I'm gonna do.
[135:51.46]I'm not going the other way.
[135:52.85]We're going right here.
[136:02.76]There's like dogs and cats over here or something.
[136:09.49]Easy.
[136:12.33]Watch out.
[136:12.61]Watch out.
[136:13.23]Watch out.
[136:13.71]Watch out.
[136:13.99]Run.
[136:15.33]Just a couple of dogs.
[136:16.27]Don't be a psycho.
[136:19.81]Just get to this one.
[136:20.83]Get to the giant fucking T. Okay.
[136:25.82]Save it.
[136:27.32]Well, Easypeed's dead forever, guys.
[136:32.54]Okay, we're getting there.
[136:35.96]We're getting there.
[136:43.28]Not sure where this is.
[136:46.84]But it's somewhere.
[136:52.73]What is it over here?
[137:04.45]I'm almost at the bunker.
[137:06.63]The boxcar.
[137:10.67]That's where I need to be.
[137:11.41]That's where the first clue is.
[137:13.03]Alright, let's get the clue.
[137:22.12]Wait, that's not where I need to be.
[137:23.16]Is it?
[137:23.82]No.
[137:24.76]Is there a clue in here?
[137:27.54]There has to be a clue.
[137:31.96]Climb it.
[137:39.94]What?
[137:40.20]There's treats over there on the left?
[137:42.36]No, I'm not going to get any treats.
[137:44.60]Gotta get up on top of this quarry.
[137:46.73]Quarry.
[137:47.83]Quarry.
[137:48.55]Encampment.
[137:53.69]I'm not going over there.
[137:54.43]How do I get up there?
[138:06.96]Can't wait to get the ranch dressing that's from this part of town.
[138:11.12]You guys get it?
[138:14.40]Hidden Valley Ranch.
[138:16.85]Nice.
[138:18.59]Screen cap that one.
[138:19.65]I bet you you'll fucking laugh.
[138:21.21]Show it to your friends.
[138:22.33]They'll laugh too.
[138:26.05]What the fuck am I doing?
[138:29.15]Oh.
[138:32.17]Shut up.
[138:34.82]Is there a way to get around here?
[138:42.03]I just need to... Okay.
[138:59.03]Do I need to be in here?
[139:01.77]No.
[139:12.19]Cheater.
[139:13.19]Cheater.
[139:14.56]Wait.
[139:15.36]Oh no.
[139:15.70]Little baby candy scorpions.
[139:18.20]These guys are gonna be easy.
[139:19.74]Easy.
[139:26.27]You guys suck.
[139:32.67]Where the hell do I need to go?
[139:33.45]I don't... I don't understand.
[139:45.68]What is here that I need to do?
[139:50.39]Is it just inside?
[139:52.93]Did I have to go down in that bunker?
[139:59.57]I don't know.
[140:08.51]I see some more scorpions over there.
[140:09.91]There's another bunker.
[140:22.51]Alright, just some more baby scorpions.
[140:24.31]They're easy.
[140:24.91]He teleported.
[140:25.73]He fucking teleported right in my face.
[140:28.06]And now I'm on fire.
[140:31.04]Even, like, through the ground.
[140:35.28]Alright.
[140:36.38]Keep thinking that's me.
[140:40.16]Anytime it does the slow motion thing, I just keep thinking I'm dying.
[140:48.24]What a bunch of shit.
[140:53.35]I think this might be the one.
[140:54.67]What do you guys think?
[140:55.28]Is this the one?
[141:04.32]I don't... I don't... I don't know.
[141:06.40]I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to be looking for.
[141:08.35]Is this just not right?
[141:19.80]No, I can't.
[141:20.44]This apparently isn't right.
[141:26.10]Shit.
[141:26.38]I have to, like, pick and choose.
[141:30.57]I'm gonna forget which ones I even went to.
[141:35.93]Did I go to that one?
[141:36.67]Or there's this one right here.
[141:37.79]Straight ahead.
[141:38.27]Is there any more behind me?
[141:47.39]He's standing still and I just wasted three.
[141:49.07]I think I was fucking bug-possed.
[141:52.73]They go so quickly, so fast.
[141:56.47]They get stuck like a dumbass.
[142:00.15]Dumbass.
[142:07.33]Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
[142:12.12]I'm on point with those ones.
[142:13.92]I'm on point.
[142:16.56]See, that was on point.
[142:17.68]What do you guys think?
[142:20.27]Nice.
[142:23.47]Ah, that was on point.
[142:27.51]Hey, what a good YouTuber's life commentary this is, huh?
[142:33.91]Alright, well, it's not that one.
[142:36.35]There's one straight ahead here and there's one to the left.
[142:40.32]Do I take donations?
[142:41.16]No.
[142:44.94]Not at this point in life, no.
[142:49.02]In the history of this channel, no.
[142:50.55]Not at this point in history.
[142:51.75]We'll try this one.
[142:52.49]Did I already go on this one?
[142:53.35]I probably did.
[142:54.15]But we're going to try again.
[143:01.19]Did I win?
[143:03.15]No, I didn't.
[143:03.55]I don't think I won the lottery.
[143:10.71]No.
[143:12.64]Whoa!
[143:12.86]Ah.
[143:12.96]Oh, shit.
[143:19.10]What do I do?
[143:23.25]Oh, fuck.
[143:23.55]What?
[143:23.71]No.
[143:23.77]Let's talk about this.
[143:24.67]I got a bunch of speech here.
[143:26.41]Why can't I do anything with speech?
[143:28.57]I can't be like, well, first of all, hold on, that's a nice helmet you got there.
[144:11.26]Bye.
[144:15.98]Okay.
[144:21.42]Okay.
[144:23.32]Here's the thing.
[144:23.86]Here's the strategy, guys.
[144:24.70]Don't even give him a chance to talk.

[153:36.44]Just to have... No.
[153:39.08]I can't even touch my keyboard right now.
[153:40.60]I can't.
[153:41.24]It's covered in water.
[153:42.46]Or iced tea.
[153:48.01]That was fucking hilarious.
[153:51.51]Just the fact that it says you hear nothing.
[153:54.09]Oh, yai yai.
[153:55.35]How did you find... Just, whatever.
[153:58.72]What does he want me to do?
[154:04.46]Kill all in console.
[154:07.57]You know, I want to let him get his whole thing out.
[154:12.77]I want to have him, like, say, like, everything he's gonna say.
[154:16.45]And then just die.
[154:17.25]Because I, like, skipped it.
[154:18.23]Oh, fuck!
[154:23.61]So, here we go.
[154:24.57]This is gonna be funny.
[154:25.75]I just need it to happen again.
[154:29.19]So it's right here.
[154:30.07]I can take care of the ranger.
[154:31.78]So it's... Kill all.
[154:34.24]Okay.
[154:36.28]Here we go.
[154:39.32]Paladin Ramos will escort you back to the bunker's entrance and set you loose.
[154:43.42]Notice that I said loose, not free.
[154:47.00]You are not free to carry the secret of this bunker's location beyond Hidden Valley.
[154:51.70]Until I'm convinced that you're capable and dependable.
[154:55.04]To underscore this point, you'll be fitted with an explosive collar.
[154:59.12]Wander off and it will detonate.
[155:01.44]Focus on your mission and you'll be fine.
[155:12.40]Some ghost came up and strangled him.
[155:14.24]I don't even want to do this shit.
[155:22.03]Fine, I'm just gonna say no.
[155:23.45]Let's just go.
[155:23.75]See, there he goes.
[155:24.45]Those guys, that's so funny.
[155:30.95]That is so funny.
[155:40.36]Yikes, that was fucking amazing.
[155:42.48]Spawn 10, deathclaws?
[155:43.71]No.
[155:46.67]Where's my equipment?
[155:53.27]Where the fuck is my stuff?
[155:55.15]I have explosive collar on my neck.
[156:00.32]Where are my belongings?
[156:05.18]What's going on here?
[156:05.84]Is he hiding it?
[156:11.67]Oh, okay.
[156:12.27]Can I put all my shit back on?
[156:17.87]What a dick.
[156:26.97]Let's go.
[156:31.88]I was skipping it.
[156:32.98]I wasn't paying that much attention to him.
[156:35.64]What do I have to do?
[156:37.70]Go back and... Okay, I'm not going to do this dumb quest.
[156:40.21]I'm going to go back and tell Yes Man.
[156:46.67]Okay, where's... Where the hell is he located?
[156:49.69]I forget.
[156:51.71]He's in the city, right?
[156:55.47]Where is Yes Man?
[156:56.43]Up here?
[156:59.22]Or is he up here?
[156:59.94]I forget.
[157:01.98]I think he's in here.
[157:06.44]What the fuck?
[157:07.64]Are you kidding me?
[157:08.08]I can't leave here?
[157:10.55]Uh, Spider Fricker.
[157:13.33]Thanks a lot, Spider Fricker.
[157:14.43]Welcome back before months.
[157:15.91]Thanks a lot.

[157:38.17]I need to go talk to Yes Man about these people.
[157:42.44]These terrible people.
[157:45.08]The Brotherhood of Steel.
[157:48.82]Up here.
[157:49.88]You cannot fast travel when enemies are nearby.
[157:51.78]Where are enemies?
[157:52.42]There's no enemies nearby.
[157:55.08]There's not a single enemy.
[157:56.86]Oh, there's just one little scorpion.
[157:58.31]Okay.
[157:59.01]Sorry.
[157:59.93]Sorry, I didn't know that this meant I couldn't move.
[158:04.19]Fuck it, idiots.
[158:05.91]Stupid, like, fucking idiot scorpions.
[158:10.89]Okay, fast travel.
[158:14.68]Fast travel is currently unavailable from this location.
[158:22.06]Why?
[158:22.26]Why?
[158:25.14]Fast travelers, you can't do fast travel.
[158:29.96]What is it?

[159:00.56]That actually kind of scared me.
[159:06.61]I don't want to do this.
[159:08.55]I have to do this?
[159:11.13]Oh, no.
[159:12.27]No, no, no.
[159:14.87]No, go back and load this fucking area again.
[159:19.83]Fuck off.

[160:07.98]So everybody in this room has to die.
[160:10.02]They're all going to die.
[160:13.24]And how do we do that exactly?
[160:15.18]How do we do that?
[160:16.54]Well, there are a couple of ways.
[160:20.46]There are a couple of ways to do it.
[160:21.90]I'll try this one.
[160:24.51]I'll give this one a try first.

[161:22.94]It's going to be a fucking great time.
[161:24.56]Wow, what a great time.
[161:28.18]There's a guy in one of the bunkers.

[166:42.97]Let's go turn it in.
[166:52.07]I can finally get this collar off my neck.
[166:55.21]There it is.
[166:55.67]Straight ahead.
[166:56.85]Why am I talking like this?
[167:02.25]Drops best weapon in the game.
[167:03.41]I think I need the best weapon in the game.
[167:08.81]I got my melee club.
[167:10.01]I don't need the best weapon in the game.
[167:15.89]You guys think I need that?
[167:21.33]Alright, take this off.
[167:22.87]Get this stupid collar off my neck.
[167:27.87]Okay, I'm ready.
[167:28.99]Alright.
[167:34.02]Reporting in.
[167:35.84]As you can see, I have the guy's clothes on and I killed him.
[167:41.29]So I demand payment for services rendered.
[167:44.22]What?
[167:44.86]What did I do?
[168:08.31]What the fuck is going on?
[168:09.61]Why are these guys attacking me?
[168:20.64]I'm wearing the clothes, that's what?
[168:23.74]Oh my god.
[168:25.37]Please.
[168:26.69]Don't they know who I am?
[168:27.95]I don't know.
[168:36.39]There.
[168:38.51]He's got like a leather jacket on now.
[168:40.15]He's dead.
[168:40.45]Didn't he tell me to do that?
[168:41.41]I thought he told me to kill him.
[168:43.83]My speech isn't even high enough to be a good speacher.
[169:02.22]What's in doubt isn't your ability to kill.
[169:05.40]It's your ability to be thorough.
[169:07.60]So again, I ask, how do you know that killing this ranger didn't make Matt... I don't know.
[169:14.83]So, did you hear how he got... You hear how angry he got because I broke his radio?
[169:19.93]Bullshit.
[169:20.45]He shot first.
[169:20.97]Did you get that on your microphone?
[169:22.01]Yeah.
[169:22.29]Dickhead.
[169:42.85]I was playing with his radio and I broke the knobs off accidentally.
[169:46.08]He freaked out and started shooting at me.
[169:51.00]Dickhead.
[169:52.20]You'll get what's coming to you in about fucking 10 seconds.
[170:05.15]I like poison this guy.
[170:20.31]Pop his head like a grape.
[170:21.82]What I wish to discuss with you can wait for once I get settled in the command room, outsider.
[170:29.14]Hopefully in the command room you're alone.
[170:30.90]That would sure be swell.
[170:35.23]Aw, damn it.
[170:35.87]It's like Mario RPG.
[170:39.55]The forest.
[170:40.79]Where did he go?
[170:42.53]That's not him.
[170:43.29]How may I assist you?
[170:46.23]Oh, the door?
[170:51.57]Poison his happy meal?
[170:52.83]I would, if I could.
[170:55.91]Is he in that room?
[170:56.47]No, he's in here.
[170:57.03]Okay, we got one guy on the left, one guy on the right.
[171:00.97]Close up this door.
[171:01.71]Okay.
[171:06.59]So.

[172:33.93]Go!
[172:39.05]What?
[172:44.74]Spawn the deathclaw and leave.
[172:49.23]Fuckin' fine.
[172:50.51]Fuckin' fine.
[172:53.60]I gotta talk to him anyways.
[172:54.72]What do you say, outsider?
[172:55.70]I have better things to do.
[173:31.26]He's still sitting in the chair, like, perfectly normal.
[173:37.17]Ooh, I got a holotag, his keycard, his laser rifle, his robes.

[173:52.77]Oh, what a psycho.
[173:55.01]Okay, where's his- I'm gonna wear his shit out of this place.
[174:02.49]No, I don't want that.
[174:03.13]Okay, Brotherhood's Elder Robes.
[174:08.69]And... The Space Helm.
[174:10.77]No, I gotta, like, look like him.
[174:11.94]I need to trick people into thinking that I'm him.
[174:20.38]Alright, let's go.
[174:21.06]Wait.
[174:22.40]What do you have?
[174:25.64]Hmm.
[174:28.40]Nah.
[174:30.54]Nah.
[174:31.52]Let's go.
[174:35.27]Oh, look, another dead body.
[174:36.33]Okay.
[174:39.57]Hmm.
[174:40.81]Take a little bit of... Ah, you know, your laser pistol, too, could work out very well for me.
[174:44.27]Everyone's just asleep.
[174:48.42]And that's all that happened.
[174:57.18]Oh, God, what happened to you?
[174:58.38]That's not...
[175:09.49]Stop!
[175:11.31]Stop!
[175:15.10]There, I saved him.
[175:17.60]Hooray!
[175:18.28]Thanks, Brovolone.
[175:19.04]Welcome back for two months.
[175:23.20]What else is making that?
[175:24.00]Somebody else is doing that right now.
[175:33.09]Zap Glove?
[175:45.55]There's, like, so much stuff here.
[175:46.85]We're all jammed.
[175:56.29]Hold on, they killed every single person?
[175:59.93]I thought I was just gonna wipe out the room.
[176:01.55]I didn't think I was gonna go on, like, a mass murder when I just touched the button.
[176:06.90]What is this, like, the happening?
[176:10.28]How do I get out of here?
[176:10.98]I'm kinda gonna leave this place immediately.
[176:21.58]Okay.
[176:23.20]Let's go.
[176:24.68]Time to go.
[176:25.10]Let me get out.
[176:28.06]So you're still alive.
[176:29.02]Good.
[176:34.04]The key card ejects you.
[176:36.42]Does it now?
[177:02.08]I destroyed the bunker?
[177:03.38]I did it.
[177:08.56]I destroyed the bunker, guys.
[177:09.68]Ah, I gotta turn it on.
[177:16.67]Listen to me, son.
[177:19.17]I'm your dad.
[177:21.59]Destroy him!
[177:25.03]Whoa!
[177:26.35]Cubuano.
[177:27.58]Cubuano.
[177:28.26]I just did.
[177:30.64]I killed everybody and I completed the mission.
[177:34.68]I completed the kill everybody mission.
[177:39.94]I needed to get a key to leave.
[177:41.22]I needed his key to leave.
[177:42.30]That's funny.
[177:50.11]What if I do kill all out here?
[177:54.91]Will it kill every single enemy?
[178:04.69]Alright, let's go back up here.
[178:10.09]Thanks for the ringtone.
[178:11.07]Well, you're welcome.
[178:15.87]Is Yes Man in here?
[178:16.69]I think he is, right?
[178:18.11]He's the computer.
[178:19.31]Lucky 38.
[178:19.65]There it is.
[178:29.89]Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
[178:34.51]None of them work.
[179:03.58]Probably for the best.
[179:09.22]Goodbye.
[179:15.51]Hey, yes, man.
[179:21.19]I got some information for you.
[179:23.51]Every Securitron on the network has been upgraded.
[179:26.61]Pretty neat, huh?
[179:27.81]Wow!
[179:28.99]You really blew up all those Securitrons at the fort.
[179:40.34]What do you know about the Brotherhood of Steel?
[179:41.94]I destroyed them.
[179:42.52]I have to actually kill all of them?
[180:07.55]I have to kill every single tribe for this to end on the wildcard?
[180:16.70]Oh dear.
[180:20.68]I feel like that's a little...
[180:37.39]Uh-oh.
[180:41.51]He's stuck on that face forever.
[180:43.13]I don't think I should have done that.
[180:55.57]Hey, you're fine.
[181:00.92]Be advised, the Lucky 38 is not open to the general public.
[181:04.80]Trespassers will be shot.
[181:06.68]Thank you.
[181:08.26]High quality gameplay.
[181:09.38]Yeah, me just doing kill all on everything.
[181:15.37]Alright, what time is it?
[181:17.05]Oh, jeez, I've been streaming this way, way longer than I intended to, but... Get to, like, one more stopping point, I think.
[181:27.91]Let's see, where are we gonna go...
[181:32.02]Casino.
[181:45.51]Time for you to get a watch.
[181:51.71]Double zero.
[181:54.81]Good call.
[182:02.11]Is there a roulette table in here?
[182:04.79]Of course there is.
[182:10.51]There's always a roulette in here.
[182:13.11]I would like to exchange Legion money.
[182:37.70]Not even using my own money, guys.
[182:40.02]I'm just giving them Legion money.
[182:46.13]How much do I have?
[182:49.45]Jesus.
[182:55.23]Do I have more?
[182:58.92]What?
[182:59.14]I have so much.
[183:03.70]I could just turn these into caps, right?
[183:10.30]Oh my god.
[183:11.58]Can I do a bigger denomination?
[183:12.88]Okay.
[183:30.49]Alright.
[183:31.81]Let's go.
[183:34.91]Got enough chips.
[183:40.28]Roulette table.
[183:41.68]Double zero.
[183:44.69]Double zero is calling my name.
[183:48.09]What?
[183:50.27]What happened?
[183:51.77]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[183:53.61]What have I done?
[183:59.66]What?
[184:01.90]What happened?
[184:02.38]Why do I have to do this again?
[184:05.00]Here's your chance.
[184:08.30]What the fuck happened?
[184:09.18]What did I do wrong?
[184:10.10]What did I do?
[184:10.54]Did I... Did I... How many chips would you like?
[184:18.36]Did I... Did I... Did I turn them in?
[184:25.66]No fucking way.
[184:27.60]No way.
[184:28.58]Why would they make you have to...
[184:37.32]What a waste of this guy's time.
[184:44.90]That's like going to the bank.
[184:47.34]So you go to the bank, you walk in, and you have $100.
[184:52.46]You go to the banker, you say, excuse me, I would like this in pennies, please.
[184:58.98]I would like $100 in pennies.
[185:01.14]They do it, and then you give it back to them and say you want this in, like, tens.
[185:06.27]You just waste the fucking person's time.
[185:11.23]Unbelievable.
[185:17.33]Okay.
[185:18.39]Good.
[185:19.59]Bye.
[185:19.85]Oh my god.
[185:26.26]Okay.
[185:26.78]Hey, remember, I can do this as much as I want.
[185:30.46]Because these chips are not even, like, real money.
[185:32.34]I didn't spend any money.
[185:33.16]This is fake money.
[185:33.84]Let's go.
[185:35.18]Double zero.
[185:40.02]It's alright.
[185:40.28]I don't even care.
[185:40.74]This isn't even my money.

[186:34.28]6,600 chips.
[186:35.78]That's more than that.
[186:38.84]I got banned from the casino.
[186:44.80]Wait, what?
[186:45.48]Game crashed.
[186:46.34]The game crashed.
[186:47.90]The game just fucking crashed.
[186:49.00]I'm not even kidding.
[186:51.73]No, and I didn't save it.
[186:52.73]I didn't save it.
[186:53.31]I didn't save it.
[186:54.57]Oh my god.
[186:56.29]Oh my god.
[186:56.87]No.
[186:58.50]No.
[186:59.60]No.
[187:06.60]I wanted to see what happened when you... When you... Game crashed.
[187:11.74]It's over.
[187:16.26]What the fuck?
[187:17.82]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[187:20.97]I don't... I... I get double zero.
[187:23.15]I get banned from the casino.
[187:25.85]I get like 7,000 chips.
[187:27.47]Which is... It's supposed to be way more than that, isn't it?
[187:30.61]And then I... Yeah.
[187:32.27]Where did that load up?
[187:32.87]I don't know.
[187:37.49]I'm giving myself those chips back.
[187:43.58]I don't care if you guys see it on stream.
[187:45.54]I'm giving myself 10,000 chips.
[187:48.40]Fuck this.
[187:54.19]How do I do that?
[187:57.49]Fuck up.
[188:00.26]Oh, you're gonna make mincemeat of me!
[188:07.16]Hold on, I give up.
[188:11.02]You guys also have to hit double zero.
[188:13.18]Okay, let's do it.
[188:19.48]I'm giving myself extra.
[188:21.59]How do I give myself fucking 10,000?
[188:28.26]That's bullshit.
[188:29.12]You're not.
[188:36.44]C7F.
[188:37.09]Okay.
[188:40.35]So, is this like a bunch of chips?
[188:44.63]No, it's EZP.
[188:46.41]Okay.
[188:47.67]Thank you for the EZP's.
[188:49.26]Thank you for the EZP's.
[188:50.54]Good.
[188:51.38]Alrighty.
[188:58.29]They're all just leaving.
[189:01.33]Okay.
[189:02.39]Have the EZP train.
[189:03.39]Oh, you guys can leave.
[189:05.15]Alrighty.
[189:09.75]Let's all go out there.
[189:10.75]Let's see where they're gonna go.
[189:13.71]Cool.
[189:16.24]Hey.
[189:17.48]Hi, guys.
[189:30.28]It's doing it again.
[189:34.56]It's doing it again.
[189:35.60]It's doing it again.
[189:42.41]We're just coming full circle.
[190:06.84]Full circle now.
[190:07.76]We did it again.
[190:10.84]Stop.
[190:11.64]Oh, the game's saved.
[190:20.08]No.
[190:23.78]Now I just got these easy peats.
[190:26.98]I just have easy peat here forever now.
[190:29.23]Because the game's saved and I can't go back.
[190:32.99]Yeah, I'm not going all the way back like 20 minutes ago.
[190:37.32]Looks like EZP, excuse me, like a dozen of them that are alive here somewhere.
[190:45.35]God.
[190:45.69]Hold on a second.
[190:54.80]Collision's off.
[191:14.13]They just turned their leg.
[191:19.91]Nothing's how her legs are kind of broken.
[191:23.94]Why is this guy still alive?
[191:27.04]What?
[191:27.36]This guy lives?
[191:30.00]Why?
[191:31.54]What the fuck?
[191:39.71]That guy didn't die in like a weird way?
[191:41.77]This guy's just waving.
[191:46.27]Okay.
[191:47.95]Okay.
[191:48.47]Well, let's see.
[191:49.31]Let's see.
[191:49.67]Turn on... Okay.
[191:57.14]Sounds like a plan.
[191:58.40]Easy feet.
[192:00.06]Give me your magnum.
[192:06.68]That was insane.
[192:09.12]Okay.
[192:09.52]Okay.
[192:10.80]Okay.
[192:14.02]I do find it quite funny, though, that these guys are here forever.
[192:19.50]I can't go back on a save.
[192:21.44]I don't know where they're going to end up.
[192:23.58]In fact, the funny part of this whole thing is I don't know where they're going to go.
[192:30.92]These EZP clones are going to show up at random points in the game from now on.
[192:36.20]wherever they're going.
[192:38.46]They're like migrating turtles.
[192:40.06]What the fuck, dude?
[192:42.32]Shut up.
[192:44.48]No, I don't want to... What the hell is he doing?
[192:47.76]I was going to say, they're like migrating turtles.
[192:51.92]We kind of have to see where they're going.
[192:56.00]We need to walk with the migrating turtle easy peats.
[192:59.93]I'm fully committed to this.
[193:04.13]Hey, hello.
[193:07.40]okay time to go home guys okay here we go let's go guys time to go home oh
[193:38.29]They just wanted to go home.
[193:39.81]They just wanted to go home.
[193:42.89]They just wanted to go home.
[193:50.27]Well, our Easy Pete problem has been corrected.
[193:55.58]Thank you for visiting New Beans.
[193:59.84]Thank you for protecting the city.
[194:06.32]Okay.
[194:07.90]Bye.
[194:11.62]You'll see these easy peats at random times during the run.
[194:15.12]Yeah.
[194:16.24]Yeah, I thought so too.
[194:17.30]You thought they were trespassing?
[194:23.13]Hold on a minute.
[194:24.67]Did you...
[194:38.63]Oh no, what have I done?
[194:39.83]I did too many.
[194:41.97]They're gonna win!
[194:55.75]They're gonna actually win.
[194:58.91]One died.
[194:59.33]Only one easy peed is dead.
[195:04.17]What are they doing?
[195:07.18]They killed them all?
[195:10.53]they did hey who's this guy hey hello hey hey hello hey hello alright now we're gonna get a good view hello we're gonna follow them on their journey hey hey hey
[195:45.71]I'll get with it.
[195:48.79]This is going to take so long for them to go where they're going.
[195:54.78]He got real out front.
[195:55.70]He wasn't messing around at all.
[196:04.22]Can I make their run speed faster?
[196:11.14]Yeah, that has to be, right?
[196:11.86]Like, how do I make an NPC's movement speed faster?
[196:14.96]Like, times 20.
[196:20.66]Give me that command.
[196:29.16]It's so funny how they're single file.
[196:31.60]They're doing a very good job being single file.
[196:39.35]Timescale book.
[196:40.21]Timescale?
[196:45.00]What is the default time scale like five?
[196:54.66]What's the command for make it go faster?
[197:10.52]Easy peep migration documentary oh
[197:16.12]Alright, it's misspelled timescale, did I?
[197:18.88]Timescale 5.
[197:22.98]Timescale not found.
[197:27.70]Timescale 5.
[197:29.26]I just did it, didn't do anything!
[197:36.33]Time... Is it space scale?
[197:41.47]No!
[197:45.15]Timescale.
[197:46.58]huh T?
[197:50.46]set time scale to five okay oh boy what's gonna happen that's lower to 100 okay set 500
[198:18.44]Uh, okay.
[198:19.06]5,000.
[198:21.84]No, that's just making it become day and night faster.
[198:24.22]It's not affecting our easy peep migration trail.
[198:28.48]It's just making the sun rise and set fast slower.
[198:41.39]SGTM?
[198:46.61]S, G, T, M... 20.
[198:52.82]Global... Oh, boy.
[198:54.80]I can already hear it.
[198:56.94]Oh, boy.
[198:57.40]Hold on.
[198:57.64]No, no, no.
[198:58.14]I can hear it.
[198:58.66]It's going too fast.
[199:02.63]Oh, God.
[199:05.49]Shit!
[199:05.75]I gotta follow him.
[199:20.73]Like, my buttons are mixed up.
[199:27.08]Okay, let's go.
[199:31.44]Alright, let's go.
[199:35.26]Where are they going?
[199:39.39]They're stopping.
[199:41.37]Not quite.
[199:51.97]Okay, our ant people are making their way through the town.
[199:57.91]Man, they're very persistent.
[200:07.20]God, I wouldn't laugh my ass off if something fucking just turns... Okay, I thought that was like a deathclaw.
[200:17.56]Where are we going?
[200:23.13]How far?
[200:24.35]Why are they going down here?
[200:31.53]This is the stupidest thing I think I've ever done.
[200:35.21]Oh, somebody's shooting.
[200:36.07]Somebody's shooting a gun.
[200:38.49]Who's shooting the gun?
[200:40.47]What is it?
[200:42.61]Wait, where?
[200:45.95]It's going too fast.
[200:48.75]Oh, it's like bandits.
[200:57.46]Oh, the action.
[201:07.25]Those are the only two that lived.
[201:21.99]Those are the only two that survived.
[201:25.53]Where'd they go?
[201:30.40]That was the only two that lived.
[201:33.87]I don't know, I lost them.
[201:37.99]I lost them.
[201:43.15]They're gone.
[201:46.03]I can't believe only two made it out.
[201:51.67]Every single one of these is dead.
[201:56.97]Right?
[201:57.91]Not one remains?
[202:00.40]How did all these guys die?
[202:04.84]What did you do down here?
[202:06.16]Were they shooting each other in the back?
[202:09.67]Oh, God.
[202:10.37]Okay, well, we gotta spawn more.
[202:17.67]We need to get them on a good journey.
[202:24.80]Hey!
[202:25.48]Okay, we'll get them here.
[202:26.44]Good 40.
[202:28.12]We're going to slow it down a little bit.
[202:34.73]We'll go to like 5.
[202:40.49]This is very important to see where the hell they end up.
[202:46.43]God, they're so dumb.
[202:49.13]You idiots.
[202:51.16]One by one they're going to figure it out.
[202:54.74]Eventually they will.
[202:55.38]Okay, we got more dangerous waters coming up here, guys.
[203:06.41]There might be another battle.
[203:11.33]There's definitely gonna be a battle up here.
[203:15.91]Yeah, battle!
[203:17.87]Battle!
[203:24.90]I can't even follow the action.
[203:28.48]How is this thing still alive?
[203:29.70]There's like 30 ETPs shooting him.
[203:43.17]He turned into a kite.
[203:47.05]No, no, no, don't lose him.
[203:49.87]Don't lose him.
[203:52.99]Where are they going?
[203:56.75]What on Earth?
[203:58.63]One made it on top of the mountain.
[204:03.03]Holy shit, you guys are dumb.
[204:06.81]Well, don't worry.
[204:07.37]We'll be alright.
[204:09.64]We'll be okay.
[204:10.38]Hold on.
[204:13.62]It's still going this way.
[204:21.18]Alright.
[204:21.54]Hold on.
[204:21.76]We gotta have the tribe.
[204:23.22]I just saved it, by the way.
[204:26.91]This one easy peep made it.
[204:30.39]One easy peep made it over.
[204:31.47]Oh, God.
[204:34.67]Oh, my God.
[204:37.09]Oh, my God.
[204:37.73]That's the scariest fucking thing.
[204:47.59]Wow, that's terrifying.
[204:49.65]Jesus Christ.
[204:52.47]How is he getting?
[205:09.80]Alright, we'll be fine.
[205:10.40]Don't worry.
[205:11.42]I got this under control.
[205:12.24]I'm just going to skip this.
[205:23.69]There we go.
[205:24.03]We'll spawn them over here.
[205:24.81]Alright, we'll be good right here.
[205:28.45]Spawn.
[205:29.89]Spawn them.
[205:31.23]There it is.
[205:32.09]40.
[205:32.29]Let's go.
[205:36.35]Do it up.
[205:37.15]Make your way back home.
[205:40.22]We're getting close.
[205:45.31]Oh no, we have an impasse.
[205:48.45]Why are they trying to go through the fucking mountains?
[205:50.37]Are we trying to go good springs?
[205:54.41]There's so much better of a way to go.
[205:58.06]No sleep.
[205:59.64]No sleep, newt newt.
[206:03.16]I love how there's always one that actually, or two that can actually have a brain.
[206:07.88]The other one's just left foot.
[206:14.85]Okay, well.
[206:18.73]Oh boy, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[206:21.74]Oh boy, they're all dead here.
[206:23.78]No, they actually got rid of the... Interesting.
[206:33.18]Jeez.
[206:41.15]Another batch of easy peats gone.
[206:48.13]Everything died here.
[206:50.53]Now, let's put them in a better position.
[206:52.75]Why is everything dead?
[206:54.50]Did I, like, kill all or something?
[206:55.98]I don't think I did.
[206:56.52]Did I?
[206:58.14]I don't know.
[207:04.48]Where's good springs?
[207:05.38]I'm gonna, like, get them.
[207:06.02]I'm gonna put these morons in a better position.
[207:07.81]Because they obviously are having a lot of trouble.
[207:12.41]So, this is, like, good springs right here, right?
[207:14.75]Okay, we're gonna spawn a hundred.
[207:18.28]No.
[207:18.46]40.
[207:18.72]I don't know if I can handle 100.
[207:20.15]Let's do it.
[207:22.87]We can find out where the hell they're going from now on.
[207:27.65]Okay.
[207:28.83]Moment of truth.
[207:30.35]What the hell are they doing over here?
[207:36.88]Where's, like, Easy Pete's house?
[207:42.34]Isn't it, like, up here?
[207:43.02]Yeah, it's, like, right here.
[207:45.77]Okay, here we go.
[207:46.25]Here they go.
[207:50.60]No.
[207:52.74]No, they're not going to... Where are they going?
[207:59.54]Oh, they're going in here.
[208:16.19]They all went in the house.
[208:18.71]This is his house?
[208:21.51]Okay, I don't remember spawning this many.
[208:23.11]This many didn't get here.
[208:25.55]You know what I'm saying?
[208:27.29]Only like four or five ended up getting in here.
[208:28.79]They're like bugs.
[208:42.84]He wants to go to bed so bad.
[208:44.62]There's already an easy peat in the bed.
[208:51.29]Can I spawn beds?
[208:53.82]What?
[208:55.12]What?
[208:55.50]He just like chipmunk squeaked at me.
[208:57.04]Alright, how do I spawn a bed?
[208:59.78]40 beats.
[209:10.74]I need to spawn a bed.
[209:12.90]I need to spawn like 20 beds.
[209:20.92]Howdy.
[209:26.58]Yep.
[209:30.16]Howdy.
[209:31.04]Oh, no.
[209:31.80]Yep.
[209:33.95]I think we might have fallen into a trap here.
[209:38.99]They're going to keep doing their dialogue event.
[209:47.43]Yep.
[209:47.85]Alright, I need beds.
[209:52.99]Where do I get beds?
[209:57.39]Player.
[209:58.99]Place at me.
[210:02.32]Give me a bed.
[210:03.30]I need some beds.
[210:10.02]God, it's like slow motion now.
[210:11.42]Yeah, it really is.
[210:13.60]Spawn one deathclaw?
[210:15.96]No, they're gonna get destroyed.
[210:17.02]I need beds.
[210:21.31]Alright, 15849.
[210:22.73]I hope this is a bed.
[210:25.73]Yeah, it's a bed.
[210:28.43]It's a bed.
[210:30.59]Okay, good.
[210:31.72]Good.
[210:41.20]Go on, get in bed.
[210:42.10]Get in these beds.
[210:45.72]Oh, they're trying to get in beds so bad.
[210:47.72]There's just not enough room.
[210:51.45]No, in here.
[210:52.01]Okay, right here.
[210:59.03]I can fit one here, right?
[211:10.33]They're sleepable.
[211:11.23]You can actually get in them.
[211:12.21]They're sleepable.
[211:14.40]No.
[211:15.02]Sorry, you got it.
[211:22.40]Get out of the way.
[211:23.18]I'm stuck now.
[211:27.04]Beds everywhere.
[211:40.51]This is going to be an easy peat in every one of these.
[211:44.09]Hello.
[211:49.11]Shit.
[211:50.51]Ow, my head.
[211:52.84]Get in this bed.
[211:53.60]Oh, fuck.
[211:56.26]Shut up.
[212:06.44]Get in the bed.
[212:07.56]Don't you guys want to sleep in these?
[212:08.50]Are you kidding me?
[212:15.91]See?
[212:16.25]Somebody went in that one.
[212:19.39]Look at that guy.
[212:20.35]That guy's not in a bed.
[212:25.77]Bastard.
[212:26.39]Did they all wake up?
[212:40.19]Yeah, they all woke up.
[212:42.98]Bastard. Bastard. Bastard. Bastard. Bastard. Bastard.
[213:03.87]Are you serious?
[213:05.89]Bastard.
[213:15.12]Come on, do it again.
[213:16.68]Say it again.
[213:17.22]Alright, Dad.
[213:25.84]He's not even hurting him.
[213:36.57]What the fuck?
[213:40.35]Now we're in business.
[213:45.79]Stop!
[213:46.13]Stop!
[213:48.64]Stop!
[213:49.04]I don't know which easy feet I'm hitting right now.
[213:56.62]Stop!
[213:57.97]Stop!
[213:58.79]Stop!
[214:10.34]We're finally out of it.
[214:15.27]Oh my lord.
[214:16.15]Bastard.
[214:18.33]Bastard.
[214:19.17]Bastard.
[214:19.91]Bastard.
[214:25.23]Ugh.
[214:27.51]Okay.
[214:31.90]Game saved.
[214:34.38]We have a saved game.
[214:36.06]And it's lagging all over the place.
[214:37.50]I might have ruined the game.
[214:41.06]What was the last save that wasn't insanity?
[214:45.41]Oh, boy.
[214:48.82]Well.
[214:50.90]Well.
[214:52.34]That's all there is to it.
[214:56.98]That's all, folks.
[214:58.60]What's even in here?
[215:15.47]I can't go outside.
[215:17.93]It's just broken.
[215:23.37]Go to bed.
[215:24.35]Yeah, I think that might be it.
[215:28.94]That was, uh... That was fun.
[215:34.30]Easy peats just to be out.
[215:36.40]Pretty much.
[215:41.42]Alright, guys.
[215:41.96]I think that's gonna be it.
[215:46.38]Go back to YouTuber's life.
[215:49.50]I want to say hello to the person that subscribed.
[215:54.09]That was Fender McBender.
[215:56.57]I missed like four subs in that carnage.
[216:00.11]So Fender McBender, thanks for... Thanks for welcome.
[216:02.71]Thanks for subscribing.
[216:03.71]Welcome to the channel.
[216:05.19]Welcome to the sub dudes.
[216:08.47]And then TheSmarty for two months.
[216:10.31]Thanks a lot, Smarty.
[216:11.15]Welcome back, dude.
[216:12.67]Good to see you again.
[216:15.30]It's me three-eyed for three months.
[216:19.10]What's going on?
[216:19.86]Three-eyed?
[216:20.47]Did I catch you?
[216:20.93]I don't know.
[216:21.31]I'm not sure if I did.
[216:24.37]Ugh.
[216:25.71]But I think that's where I'm going to call it.
[216:28.59]When's the next video?
[216:30.75]Well, after that, I think I have enough to make at least one or two follow-up videos.
[216:36.33]I want to get a couple more things.
[216:39.05]And there's a lot of stream highlights like Dark Souls 3 and a bunch of other things that are going to go up in the very, very soon time frame.
[216:50.31]So don't worry, there'll be content on the YouTube channel if you haven't seen it.
[216:54.80]It's almost been 45 minutes.
[216:56.78]Time for Shovel Knight.
[217:00.57]It's almost been 45 minutes.
[217:03.09]We did get double zero.
[217:04.49]We got double zero tonight, so that's good.
[217:07.65]This had to happen because you lost double zero.
[217:09.51]Yeah.
[217:10.70]I went on a total rampage because I lost it.
[217:13.74]But thanks a lot for coming out, guys.
[217:14.92]Appreciate it.
[217:16.88]If you're a new viewer, welcome.
[217:19.98]If you're an old viewer, thanks for sticking around.
[217:22.98]And again, thanks to you to all the new subs, all the old subs, everybody watching, all the viewers.
[217:27.53]Good night, everybody.
[217:29.17]I'll probably catch you tomorrow.
[217:30.77]I'm not sure if we're going to play Fallout tomorrow.
[217:32.41]I might try to do my placement games in Overwatch just because I have to do it at some point.
[217:39.80]And if not, then maybe we can get the boys together for Dead by Daylight.
[217:45.61]I don't know.
[217:46.97]But good night.
[217:48.01]Good luck.
[217:49.13]Take care, buddy.
[217:50.23]Goodbye.
