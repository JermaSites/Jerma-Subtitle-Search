[00:57.09]Good to see you.
[00:59.37]It's been a few days.
[01:03.01]That's cool.
[01:05.79]To get some shit done.
[01:06.81]That's what I do.
[01:10.19]Get shit done.
[01:16.14]Just hanging out today.
[01:16.96]I saw this, uh, saw people playing this game.
[01:21.71]This is called Inzoy.
[01:23.57]Apparently there's a car in the game that you can drive.
[01:26.45]And I said, well, I got to play it.
[01:29.85]As the sole authority on car video games on this channel.
[01:39.36]I saw the creator character too.
[01:40.40]I just wanted to fuck around with it.
[01:41.30]It looked funny.
[01:44.65]There might be, later... I gotta finish Chrono Trigger.
[01:51.08]We got Clive Barker's Undying at some point this week.
[02:02.04]Yeah, Chrono Trigger... We're getting close.
[02:03.71]Chrono Trigger's almost done.
[02:06.39]I think we're a solid... maybe one or two more sessions.
[02:20.81]When's the Squeaks stream?
[02:26.04]I love Squeaks.
[02:26.70]Squeaks is a great channel.
[02:29.02]We're going to do the Monster Rancher 2 tournament.
[02:31.86]That's probably going to be at this point this weekend, next weekend.
[02:36.24]I got to get confirmations.
[02:37.64]I got to get things set up.
[02:41.31]You guys want Robocop?
[02:43.47]You really want Robocop?
[02:50.66]Yes.
[02:56.75]When does the Elden Ring new game come out?
[02:59.35]That's like a month or two, right?
[03:10.69]That is so, so close.
[03:14.43]Alright, ads are going to play.
[03:15.20]Let's get them out of the way.
[03:15.98]I'll be back in a few minutes to get started.
[03:17.94]How the heck are you?
[03:20.70]Huh?
[03:21.12]How the heck are you?
[03:21.84]I'll be right back.
[03:27.06]See you in three to four minutes.
[03:29.99]BRB.
[03:45.47]Somebody said subathon.
[03:46.87]I'm going to get cut off by the ads.
[03:49.11]Or maybe I won't.
[03:51.01]I told you my subathon idea.
[03:53.63]Where I wanted to just have a timer that started and when you subscribe, the time came off of the... I'm drinking a pineapple juice.
[04:03.36]Relax.
[04:04.74]I wanted time to come off.
[04:07.02]I don't smoke.
[04:07.62]I'm not smoking.
[04:09.52]I wanted time to come off the total timer.
[04:18.30]and have it just, it would literally last one minute and this frame would turn off.
[04:25.28]No, I got some pineapple juice.
[04:26.72]I got the little pineapple residue.
[04:31.07]Alright, ad should be starting now, but you know how it is.
[04:42.26]Sometimes this shit doesn't work for like two minutes.
[04:48.13]I love pineapple juice.
[04:48.99]It's like the greatest beverage.
[04:53.64]You gotta be care- Don't drink too much of this shit though.
[04:55.32]Alright, be right back.
[07:40.71]Coming back here in about 20 seconds.
[07:48.76]Trans visibility day.
[07:52.40]Let's freaking go.
[07:53.16]Good to see you.
[08:00.77]What was that noise?
[08:09.56]What noise is it?
[08:11.23]Oh, that Enzo is in the background right now.
[08:17.55]Can you play?
[08:24.15]Would you say Pop Tropica?
[08:27.43]Is that shit even still online?
[08:32.49]Alright, let's get this off.
[08:37.71]Okay, here we go.
[08:41.43]Uh, I... Hopefully my computer can run this game.
[08:44.79]I don't, uh... I know that sounds insane coming from somebody with a 3090.
[08:50.96]But you know how it is nowadays.
[08:52.48]Who knows?
[08:52.78]Alright, new game.
[08:56.92]So this is a game kind of like The Sims, I guess.
[08:59.47]It's like Sims-like.
[09:04.89]Okay, so what does this... So they're called Zoys.
[09:08.85]Turn on DLSS.
[09:09.85]I actually did.
[09:10.53]I did.
[09:18.14]We're going to be here for like probably three hours, by the way.
[09:19.96]I don't have to do anything.
[09:24.20]That's kind of what I look like right now.
[09:26.46]Make the hair longer.
[09:34.82]I think we have to keep Drake Lewis.
[09:36.16]I think that has to stay.
[09:39.02]Uh, okay.
[09:40.44]What's my trait?
[09:41.48]What does this matter?
[09:43.55]Leader.
[09:44.69]No, fuck that.
[09:47.71]No, fuck that.
[09:49.41]That's kind of cool.
[09:49.99]Yeah.
[09:55.33]Should I be a socialite?
[09:57.63]Be an authoritarian?
[10:01.89]Confident, daring, dominant, impulsive, aggressive, extroverted.
[10:10.74]This is like the streamer career, isn't it?
[10:19.20]Should I do the streamer career?
[10:21.84]Extroverted intro.
[10:22.68]Can you actually do that?
[10:23.57]Can I select it?
[10:31.32]It looks like you.
[10:32.78]By the way, this is not going to look like me.
[10:37.33]You understand that a game like this with a character creator that's very in-depth... I'm just gonna make a monster with a gigantic nose.
[10:44.66]That's just every game.
[10:45.60]I'm sorry.
[10:46.98]I know we're pulling out some of the uh... some oldies here.
[10:51.32]But if it's a character creator, it's gonna be a character with a big nose.
[10:54.68]And like his eyes are gonna be up here.
[10:56.78]I'm sorry.
[10:58.60]Sometimes you have to redo the classics.
[11:03.06]I'll do entertainer.
[11:03.96]Who cares?
[11:06.85]What about visionary?

[24:13.97]I like this a lot too.
[24:21.33]But can I really go away from Zoomer Beavis?
[24:23.93]From Beavis and Butthead?
[24:24.83]I don't think I can.
[24:31.05]What about the hair color?
[24:33.04]Beards maybe?
[24:38.91]No, I don't think that works.
[24:47.38]No, that doesn't work.
[24:52.18]I think I'm good.
[24:55.53]I think I'm good.
[24:56.11]I just need to do clothes now.
[24:57.25]How do I change clothes?
[25:02.31]It's so annoying that I probably would wear this.
[25:09.51]I don't know if I could pull off the pants though.
[25:13.43]I don't think I can pull the pants off.
[25:17.37]No, I don't think so.
[25:19.09]No way.
[25:21.33]Not a chance in hell.

[26:06.09]That's a really important question.
[26:15.28]Okay, what about the thighs?
[26:16.40]Should I go small thighs?
[26:22.51]Small thighs and huge calves.
[26:25.29]How big can I make the hands?
[26:27.59]Can I have huge hands?
[26:35.82]I can make my head even smaller.
[26:37.22]I kind of need the big head.
[26:44.75]Yeah, I need the big head.
[26:45.79]I want the big head.
[26:46.57]I want really small hands.
[27:05.04]Okay.
[27:06.56]What about the calves?
[27:07.36]Can I do anything with the calves?

[27:42.25]I think that works.
[27:53.53]Outfit.
[27:57.35]Why am I standing like this?
[28:01.62]Why am I standing like this?
[28:03.91]Is he doing the gamer pose?
[28:08.16]What was that?
[28:08.56]What did that mean?
[28:14.36]Oh, God.
[28:15.40]No.
[28:16.60]Absolutely not.
[28:18.40]Although... Okay, I feel like I'm making a Jerry Lewis movie.
[28:22.31]This is a Jerry Lewis character in a Jerry Lewis movie.
[28:34.28]Are they all Jerry Lewis characters from a Jerry Lewis movie?
[28:43.09]This one kind of fits the aesthetic I'm going with here.
[28:48.01]His name is Drake Lewis!
[28:49.75]Holy shit, that's right!
[28:51.09]I didn't even mean to do that.
[29:02.09]Alright, but should we give him...
[29:05.93]Are the glasses too much?
[29:09.17]Or should we style?
[29:09.91]Okay, let's style them.
[29:10.91]You know what I mean?
[29:11.77]Let's style them.
[29:13.45]Okay, good.
[29:19.18]No, no, we need a better jacket than that.
[29:22.66]I'm thinking blazer.
[29:29.34]Hmm.
[29:33.47]Button up?
[29:34.05]No, no, blazer for sure.
[29:38.38]I'm a dreamer.
[29:43.16]Do this in skinny jeans?
[29:52.70]Uh, I don't know.
[29:56.22]Should we give like a puppy vest?
[30:07.79]Definitely not this one.
[30:11.45]Like 100%, absolutely not this one.
[30:16.97]Why am I, what am I doing?
[30:17.83]What is that?
[30:18.23]Alright, I'm going to stick with the blazer.
[30:22.64]This one right here.
[30:37.93]Jogging pants?
[30:45.05]Give him back the Jean shorts?
[30:46.80]Oh man, okay.
[30:51.56]Wear the Jean shorts.
[30:56.32]What am I doing?
[30:56.90]What just happened?
[30:59.27]What the hell was that?
[30:59.93]What am I doing?
[31:02.01]Should I give him, like, fucking pajama pants?
[31:07.33]No, that's too... laugh out loud, haha, hilarious, like random, right?
[31:12.39]No, no, no.
[31:13.23]It has to be a theme here.
[31:23.72]I can't.
[31:25.68]I can't.
[31:32.82]It's just these big sneakers?
[31:45.31]How about... How about these just, like, shoes?
[31:49.81]How about these, like, cartoon shoes?
[31:58.86]Oh, those are actually kind of cool.
[32:08.62]Give him knee-high socks.
[32:09.93]Do I not have any underwear on?
[32:13.35]Wait, what?! !
[32:16.67]You could not have underwear on.
[32:20.09]Why is that a feature?
[32:21.07]OK, I think we're good.
[32:34.16]Oh, formal.
[32:35.54]OK, this is every day, right?
[32:37.06]That's our every day.
[32:38.44]Formal.
[32:42.79]I actually kind of like it.
[32:44.55]I think it's perfect.
[32:47.20]Does he even have socks on?
[32:48.94]Probably not.
[32:49.49]I don't know.
[32:51.81]School?
[32:52.49]This is what he's going to school in.
[32:57.19]Usually I keep these the way they are.
[32:58.89]Okay, party.
[32:59.59]I like it.
[33:01.11]It looks like the mask.
[33:02.42]It does look like the mask.
[33:03.32]Alright, formal.
[33:06.92]I did this.
[33:09.32]I think I like this.
[33:09.96]I think it's perfect.
[33:14.84]But for a party...
[33:17.53]I think we're going to do something else for a party.
[33:21.29]There we go.
[33:22.57]Alright, I think we're good.
[33:31.04]It's time.
[33:31.96]Swimsuit?
[33:42.13]Where's the thing I'm wearing right now?
[34:03.59]Oh, it's just in his underwear.
[34:04.63]That's what he's going to go in the pool with?
[34:13.22]Wait, what about like a pair of jeans?
[34:14.66]Alright, this is my swimwear.
[34:18.08]I'm gonna get into the pool with a pair of jeans like a fucking psycho, you know what I mean?
[34:21.25]You know that psycho that goes in the pool with their jeans on?
[34:25.01]Like, dude.
[34:26.53]Alright, that, yeah, relax.
[34:37.20]No, none of this.
[34:45.40]Sorry, should I wear like a gamer headset?
[34:52.16]I think I want to wear... I think I want to wear a gamer headset every day.
[34:57.77]This is my swimsuit?
[35:01.79]Is this gonna hurt me?
[35:13.69]I'm gonna hate this in like an hour.
[35:17.09]I'm actually gonna hate this in an hour.
[35:27.04]Can I take it off eventually?
[35:30.91]No, I'm not putting the ears on.
[35:36.07]Should we give him a shitload of rings too?
[35:40.37]Yeah.
[35:40.83]Give me some like massive diamonds and emeralds and shit.
[35:45.89]Can I do that?

[50:37.90]Now I need to... This is a nice place.
[50:51.05]I'll read the door.
[50:54.03]Where am I going?
[50:57.38]Sit and rest.
[51:05.92]Shit, I made him too old!
[51:07.47]I made him as old as you possibly could make somebody and all I do is eat soup and sit down.
[51:13.71]I made him way too old.
[51:16.37]He's asleep in the chair.
[51:22.94]I didn't realize how true is this going to be.
[51:25.78]He's just sleeps and eats soup.
[51:30.36]Should I have not made him all the way to old as far as you can go?
[51:33.26]Oh, what's wrong?
[51:45.57]Oh, he's he's really happy.
[51:48.05]That was very tranquil.
[51:49.30]OK, cool, let's go.
[51:59.16]Alright, I'm good.
[51:59.94]Let me go meet some people.
[52:01.73]Can I go knock on somebody's house?
[52:02.67]What if I just go knock on this person's door?
[52:11.86]It took me 25 minutes to go across the street, by the way.
[52:14.52]Anybody live here?
[52:17.07]Oh, hold on.
[52:34.99]Anybody here?
[52:35.39]I think I lost.
[52:47.29]Oh no, he is too old.
[52:51.57]I don't know where my house is.
[52:53.41]Oh, this is not good.
[52:58.55]Now what is he doing?
[53:25.23]I can't walk.
[53:26.77]He has... Okay, I got to level one critical thinking.
[53:30.69]Okay, so... I am on somebody else's front porch.
[53:34.86]This is not my front porch.
[53:36.98]I think that... Do I have plants?
[53:39.46]Yes.
[53:39.94]No, I don't.
[53:41.54]Critical thinking level up.
[53:46.84]Hey, you.
[53:47.16]I need to make some friends.
[54:00.96]I look like I'm in a mascot outfit.
[54:03.08]Do you know what I mean?
[54:04.14]I look like I'm in like a fursuit.
[54:05.82]Like a mascot outfit.
[54:06.82]Do you know what I mean by that?
[54:08.54]Why do I feel that way?
[54:11.94]I feel like I'm in a giant foam suit.
[54:16.51]Okay, are we friends?
[54:20.91]Look into your personal problems.
[54:23.37]What?
[54:26.12]Say building up your relationship is fun.
[54:28.62]Discuss the stock prospects of the K-pop and entertainment industries.
[54:31.88]Let's do that!
[54:32.32]Do I smell?
[54:48.54]Oh, okay.
[54:49.70]Uh, what else?
[54:51.22]Discuss healthy bathing habits.
[54:54.20]That's the only thing I have is I took a bath.
[55:16.33]Alright, that worked.
[55:18.77]I'm apparently pretty cool.
[55:21.13]Let's speak logically for a little while.
[55:22.59]Okay.
[55:24.81]Talk about our favorite painters.
[55:39.15]This is a conversation you cannot get away from.
[55:40.67]You know how badly you want to get out of this conversation, but another topic keeps coming up every time.
[55:47.67]And if you start bringing up painters, it's like shit, this is like at least a 30 minute conversation that I'm stuck in now.
[55:55.76]What's this?
[56:02.44]What about some of your recently played video games?
[56:09.59]Explain to me what your favorite video game console is in extreme detail.
[56:18.53]Ask on a date?
[56:20.13]Wait, are we... Was there, like, chemistry or something?
[56:23.41]Um, no?
[56:24.93]Shake hands.
[56:26.19]By the way, I'm sorry.
[56:27.23]I wasn't so formal about this.
[56:28.15]It's wonderful to meet you.
[56:30.11]My name's Drake Moose.
[56:31.59]Just moved in down the street.
[56:37.04]There.
[56:37.28]Here's a business card.
[56:39.02]I don't have a job, but, you know, one day that's going to be... One day that'll be filled with something.
[56:47.15]Or maybe not.
[56:51.43]Or... Oh, hold on.
[56:52.69]I don't know where... Wait.
[56:54.83]Oh, hey.
[56:55.97]How's it going?
[56:56.65]First of all, the same exact fucking haircut that I have.
[56:58.57]We're going to be best friends.
[57:01.80]What are you doing?
[57:03.12]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[57:04.10]What's up?
[57:08.37]Get out of here with the same ass haircut.
[57:10.75]Hold on, I'll be right back.
[57:21.94]I have to go scrape with somebody.
[57:31.54]Sorry, there can only be one person on this street with the same haircut.
[57:34.08]It's not going to be you.
[57:38.43]Where'd you get that done?
[57:42.23]Where'd you get that hair done?
[57:44.89]I just moved here.
[57:50.03]I think we got off on the wrong foot.
[57:51.15]Here's my business card.
[57:51.97]I thought you could just like keep aggroing people.
[58:04.78]Okay, I'm gonna wait till they walk away.
[58:16.54]I'm gonna call them back over and then ignore them.
[58:18.98]That's a power move.
[58:22.04]Oh yeah, see you later.
[58:26.38]Oh yeah, by the way, one more thing.
[58:30.23]I don't give a shit.
[58:30.79]Well, this is caring way more than ignoring.
[58:34.44]Do you like mint chocolate?
[58:42.97]What a weird thing to ask somebody.
[58:44.47]What?
[58:46.77]I like that.
[58:47.91]Reminisce about past memories.
[59:02.47]I need to sleep.
[59:03.33]Okay.
[59:03.77]Look into your personal problems.
[59:06.69]What does that do?
[59:08.39]Help me get through my life?
[59:11.47]Mm-hmm.
[59:31.06]Well, you didn't.
[59:31.48]Okay, whatever.
[59:32.84]Should I go up to the red light and just kind of start asking people questions at the red light?
[59:48.37]I got the level one critical thinking.
[59:50.03]This is great.
[59:54.69]Look at all this traffic!
[60:04.19]I can't get in this vehicle.
[60:10.99]Hey, roll your window down!
[60:13.29]Roll your window down!
[60:28.05]I can't just do this, right?
[60:34.47]Sit and read newspaper.
[60:43.52]Oh, there's traffic!
[60:47.63]It's unbelievable!
[60:54.37]No!
[60:55.01]Hey!
[61:03.83]Hold on, can I get hit by a car?
[61:06.18]Can I get hit by a car?
[61:07.66]Please don't tell me I get hit by a car.
[61:09.02]Alright, I'm going to go home.
[61:18.82]I'm going to make dinner.
[61:20.88]I'm going to get a job, I guess.
[61:22.29]I don't know.
[61:23.41]I'm going to go do like an activity.
[61:26.87]Karma action?
[61:28.97]What does that do?
[61:33.10]What the fuck?
[61:33.76]I can actually start kicking stuff?
[61:41.33]Am I getting in trouble?
[61:44.91]I'm not going to get in trouble, right?
[61:50.16]You're going to get a one star wanted level.
[61:55.00]Alright.
[61:55.52]Go home.
[61:56.08]Go home.
[61:56.40]Go home.
[62:04.11]Can you go home faster than this?
[62:17.42]Coming up on a break here too.
[62:19.48]It's already been an hour.
[62:20.36]Damn, OK.
[62:24.59]Well, I want to keep going.
[62:25.37]Feels like there's a lot to see.
[62:26.77]He's like 40.
[62:41.10]Donate to the local community.
[62:42.31]I'm gonna donate to the local community.
[62:43.89]And then I'm gonna vent my frustration by kicking the mailbox.
[63:13.52]That should cover me kicking the mailbox, right?
[63:18.96]Alright, I'll be right back.
[63:20.86]See you in a few minutes.
[63:24.38]Get up and move around if you need to.

[66:58.08]Alright, go home.
[67:11.49]Welcome back everybody.
[67:14.33]I'm in the process of going home.
[67:17.80]My home is over here.

[67:33.31]Alright, let's make dinner.
[67:37.53]How do I make a real dinner?
[67:39.79]Full dinner on the oven, right?
[67:42.48]Make food.
[67:45.40]Ooh, alright.
[67:46.08]Making French toast?
[67:49.34]Seafood?
[67:49.92]Okay, what about a salad?
[67:51.99]How about pancakes?
[67:53.41]Egg bread.
[67:53.91]I'll make pancakes.
[68:11.50]Dinner at noon?
[68:14.86]It's only 12 p.m.
[68:16.96]Okay, the game time goes much slower than I thought it was.
[68:20.99]It's not even noon.
[68:22.17]It's noon!
[68:22.87]Nice.
[68:46.84]Looks pretty good.
[68:47.56]Now, I can't like burn my house down in this one, can I?
[68:51.90]In this game?
[68:57.18]Looks good.
[69:02.72]Perfect flip.
[69:05.08]Still got it.
[69:18.72]Alright, I think it's done.
[69:19.42]I'm going to eat a stack of pancakes for lunch.
[69:25.85]Well, don't do that.
[69:26.57]I hate that.
[69:31.55]Eat it.
[69:34.12]Wander around.
[69:34.98]You just made pancakes.
[69:35.94]Aren't you hungry?
[69:39.82]Eat the pancakes.
[69:59.58]So... What?
[70:05.40]Why did smelling the pancakes just make me nervous?
[70:10.98]Why am I nervous?
[70:17.81]What the fuck am I doing?
[70:21.71]Um... No, I think I'd rather have a soup instead.
[70:29.42]Pancakes made him nervous, so now he's going to eat soup.
[70:36.00]No.
[70:37.08]Now he's going to go on his phone.
[70:38.28]And he's going to take a picture of the soup.
[70:51.03]I'm breathing really heavily.
[70:52.11]No.
[70:54.33]I kind of want to just see what he does.
[71:04.84]Gonna get a book and go read.
[71:09.12]He's really hungry.
[71:10.94]That's a good idea.
[71:16.04]Nice book.
[71:32.09]Isn't he hungry?
[71:33.23]I'm waiting for him to realize he's hungry.
[71:36.98]Is he going to read the whole book?
[71:40.66]Holy shit, he's going to read the whole book?
[71:43.98]I just did it.
[71:44.58]Alright, now what?
[72:01.39]Alright, I'm taking control.
[72:04.27]I'm assuming control.
[72:08.59]Go eat this.
[72:13.06]Apparently that book was really not good.
[72:15.72]Have some pancakes.
[72:35.96]I hate that it's on the corner like that.
[72:38.22]That's not good.
[72:38.90]Alright, eat up.
[72:40.80]Let's go.
[72:44.14]Pretty good.
[72:50.26]He's not even satisfied.
[72:51.20]He needs more food.
[73:00.79]Good.
[73:07.31]Should I put it in a bag?
[73:08.81]Wait, can I... Wait, put the soup in a bag.
[73:18.92]Oh, he actually is washing the dishes.
[73:20.40]Alright, good for you.
[73:21.12]Alright, put this... Put the soup in a bag.
[73:26.30]Um... Um, what?
[73:38.31]Oh, let's go.
[73:38.69]We're going to go here.
[73:39.19]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[73:39.99]Let's do this.
[73:43.87]Let's go to the park.
[73:52.58]Concentrated.
[73:53.16]Can I take a taxi to the park?
[74:08.98]He's not going to walk like this to the park.
[74:11.82]Where's the park?
[74:14.82]Hopefully this is the park right here.
[74:15.86]Oh, I'm getting on the bus.
[74:27.54]Cool.
[74:27.88]Alright.
[74:28.86]I did it.
[74:39.19]You got soup dripping down your leg.
[74:42.31]That's disgusting.
[74:43.29]There's nobody here.
[74:46.55]Huh?
[74:52.45]Wait, wait, wait a second.
[74:59.23]There's nobody even at this event.
[75:02.62]This park is fucking empty.
[75:04.16]They even hired a taco truck and everything.
[75:06.00]I'm the only person here.
[75:19.80]Is anybody going to come to the event?
[75:30.90]Oh, I feel bad for the party planner.
[75:32.50]Oh, there's a person.
[75:34.06]It's the person that works the truck.
[75:43.09]They want some directions.
[75:47.35]Yeah, this is obviously the wrong park for the two of us, considering there's nobody here.
[75:52.07]It's probably the park down the street, which I think it's down that way.
[75:55.74]Yeah, the person must have fucked up the invitations.
[75:57.76]I don't think I should be eating a bunch of tacos.
[76:22.63]What else can I do?
[76:23.35]There's nobody at the fucking park!
[76:27.27]Do you have any soup left over?
[76:37.27]Oh shit, I probably do.
[76:38.51]Where's my inventory?
[76:46.12]Uh oh.
[76:51.97]Do I have an inventory?
[76:52.65]Oh shit, what did I just do?
[77:07.36]Oh, it's build mode.
[77:08.52]No, no, no.
[77:09.08]Did I just put that on the ground?
[77:20.43]Hello, hey, how are you?
[77:21.81]Welcome to the event.
[77:22.87]I'm so glad that there's people at the event.
[77:27.31]Oh, a friend.
[77:28.51]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[77:33.53]What?
[77:33.65]Yo.
[77:35.43]Oh.
[77:50.96]okay um trusting attitude what the hell am I doing I thought I was just rubbing his chest I did not tell him to do that
[78:23.64]We're both exhausted.
[78:29.10]Suspect that your life is under surveillance.
[78:31.66]This party sucks.
[78:32.20]Share great places to eat in town.
[78:54.47]Ask about career.
[79:05.88]It's not a party.
[79:06.70]It's just time in your schedule to go to the park because you have a tranquil lifestyle.
[79:10.94]Oh, it's because I'm like an old guy with a tranquil life.
[79:14.84]It's not a party.
[79:15.58]It's just this is the I spend six hours a day at the park.
[79:30.23]What else can I do at the park?
[79:33.15]Can I play with the ball?
[79:40.61]Wait, change clothes.
[79:41.41]How about summer clothes?
[79:44.95]There we go.
[79:45.49]And let's also do posture.
[79:58.73]Lean against the wall with arms crossed, sit on the floor?
[80:22.93]Secret what?
[80:30.72]How would I even know I did that?
[80:42.32]Oh my god, that was fucking rancid!
[80:46.10]I hated every single part of that animation.
[80:48.44]From the first part of the first frame to the last one.
[80:53.98]That was the worst animation I've ever seen in my life.
[81:06.15]How can I ride this?
[81:07.09]Am I allowed to do this?
[81:13.16]I I guys I need to make some fucking friends like for real.
[81:24.91]You.
[81:29.15]We need to have a party.
[81:31.21]We gotta, we gotta get, we gotta get, you know, a couple of cocktails.
[81:36.29]I can't just go to the park every day and, and ride the children's rides.
[81:44.56]Sour cream potato chips?
[81:46.30]Oh, that's my favorite flavor.
[81:52.56]Is there really, like, a Pringles can?
[82:08.13]I'm not gonna break it.
[82:09.35]I'm not gonna break it.
[82:10.29]Alright, where we going?
[82:24.86]What am I riding?
[82:30.28]Ride what?
[82:43.67]I'm not walking all the way over.
[82:45.11]Oh my God, I am walking all the way over here.
[82:49.93]With the Pringles can in the hand.
[82:56.58]This guy do this every day.
[83:17.69]What else do you want to do on your daily activity?
[83:22.31]Oh, you know what?
[83:22.85]That was delicious.
[83:23.58]I think I might have another sour cream... sour cream fringles.
[83:29.24]How are you?
[83:29.86]Good to see you again.
[83:30.60]Okay, I'm normal.
[83:43.67]God forbid an old man catches a vibe.
[83:47.75]No, I'm just... Ah, yeah.
[83:56.40]Of course.
[83:56.74]I remember when I was younger.
[83:58.00]I love sour cream Pringles.
[84:00.14]You know what else I like to do?
[84:01.88]Thinking about it.
[84:03.58]Riding the little kids rides.
[84:06.74]Ah, man.
[84:07.20]There's that delicious flavor.
[84:09.38]Creaminess of the sour cream.
[84:12.54]Bite of the onion at the end.
[84:16.29]Scrumptious.
[84:39.16]Drinking fountain?
[84:40.12]Wash your hands in the drinking fountain?
[84:41.84]Fuck outta here!
[84:44.66]Who's doing that?
[84:45.38]What's going on with his nose?
[85:02.01]I saw a rude customer?
[85:13.44]I can't believe it.
[85:14.10]Yeah, I saw this rude guy.
[85:16.37]Recommend favorite coffee beans.
[85:48.57]There we go.
[85:52.47]Okay.
[85:59.11]How am I doing?
[86:06.28]Okay, I need to sleep.
[86:07.60]I'm getting tired here.
[86:09.46]Can you actually wash?
[86:10.54]I can actually do that.
[86:12.12]I cannot use this.
[86:14.68]What's wrong with me?
[86:24.54]Oh, I'm going to play soccer.
[86:41.83]Can I upgrade my athletic stuff?
[86:45.07]That's all I wanted to do, I guess.
[86:47.27]Pass the soccer ball back.
[86:48.61]Yeah, let's do it.
[86:49.57]Who wants to do it?
[86:51.99]What's your name?
[86:53.26]Russell Cannon.
[86:58.86]This is the hot dog guy.
[87:12.05]This is lame as fuck, by the way.
[87:13.91]Like, this is lame.
[87:17.11]That was really lame.
[87:18.77]Wow, that was the worst activity that I think I've ever done.
[87:25.50]That was... There was nothing fun about what we just did.
[87:35.67]I'm gonna do it again.
[87:36.23]Yeah, can we get a little bit further apart?
[87:41.45]This is not even... I don't think there's any... Stop being a hater, you chosen old man.
[87:56.42]No, I love this.
[87:57.72]This is perfect.
[88:01.66]I think somebody wants a hot dog.
[88:03.58]He's supposed to be... Wait, are they stealing?
[88:24.69]Why are you running?
[88:27.15]That person is running.
[88:34.89]And by the way, we even talked to this guy once.
[88:37.03]Should I even mock him?
[88:53.12]You're a dog shit at soccer.
[88:55.88]Well, prove it then.
[88:56.64]Try to get the ball by me.
[88:59.36]Am I sick?
[89:11.74]I'm taking a hot dog.
[89:28.04]I haven't done anything but eat food.
[89:29.56]What?
[89:32.70]It seems like this Zoe doesn't like street food.
[89:35.61]How about logging that they dislike street food?
[89:38.29]Meow.
[89:41.29]What?
[89:42.01]I've been eating it all day.
[89:44.25]Oh god, how do I get home?
[89:53.67]Can I get a ride?
[89:54.29]Can anybody pick me up?
[90:00.13]Owned car.
[90:02.39]How much is a car?
[90:03.63]A Z car.
[90:04.63]I want this.
[90:08.63]Z car will make it easier to travel anywhere anytime.
[90:10.21]Enjoy greater freedom of movement than walking everywhere.
[90:12.07]Perfect.
[90:12.33]Okay.
[90:15.35]I wanted blue.
[90:21.10]Well, I'm going to only have 2000 bucks.
[90:22.38]Is that bad?
[90:28.96]Parking lot in front of the house.
[90:36.79]Yeah, no, it's already... I did it automatically.
[90:40.40]That's the first thing I did.
[90:41.20]My brain said... When somebody said you can drive a car, I said, okay, I'm doing it.
[90:45.78]Alright, so where do I go?
[90:46.68]Dream car.
[90:48.18]There it is.
[90:48.54]I can have it pull up to me?
[90:52.15]What a mouth.

[91:19.42]Let's go.
[91:19.84]Alright, how do you drive?
[91:45.79]I thought I turned on manual driving.
[91:47.61]Where am I going?
[91:48.13]Where am I going?
[91:49.05]Options, gameplay.
[91:51.73]Yeah, manual driving.
[91:53.51]Oh shit, it's not on.
[92:20.37]How do I do it?
[92:22.69]Oh, I want to turn off auto-drive.
[92:24.05]Okay.

[92:53.61]Okay, open trunk?
[92:56.25]Wash the car in the middle of the street?
[92:58.28]I don't have any tools.
[93:14.24]I'm just using my bare hands.
[93:28.16]Okay, get in.
[93:32.82]Sit in the driver's seat.
[93:39.23]Okay.
[93:57.22]You actually can drive in this game, what?
[93:59.12]Alright, gotta stop sign, go.
[94:11.48]Oh no, you got a red light, never mind.
[94:23.86]Wait, can you fuck up the car?
[94:25.15]If I crash it, will I have to- I only have- I have no money.
[94:55.80]breaking every rule.

[95:15.16]I want to get closer.
[95:23.36]That just loaded up.
[95:24.12]That loaded out of nowhere.
[95:24.96]That literally loaded up, it popped in, and I crashed.
[95:27.74]I think the car's fine.
[95:38.72]Okay, I like this car's image.
[95:52.13]I don't want to hit everybody.
[95:55.51]Why can you do this?
[95:57.57]Why can you do this?
[95:59.17]I'm shocked, but also I think it's hilarious and I think it's cool.
[96:02.63]Why can I do this in a Sims game?
[96:09.86]I want to get a... I need to see those fireworks.
[96:22.65]Oh, am I too late?
[96:23.51]Am I too late for the finale?

[98:25.23]How about some sour cream and onion potato chips?
[98:39.30]Are they open?
[98:41.88]I don't think they're open.
[98:52.93]Bagel bagel.
[98:56.75]I'm gonna fall asleep.

[157:13.15]Why is she doing that too?
[157:26.00]Why are they both doing this?
[157:27.48]Is she mocking me?
[157:32.10]Or is she also having problems?
[157:35.05]What's wrong with her?
[157:36.59]Why are we both fucked up?

[159:11.84]How do I fight him?
[159:49.98]What am I doing?
[159:50.74]I don't know where I'm going.
[160:20.89]What?
[160:29.57]Eat your Pringles.
[160:30.37]You'll be fine.
[160:32.62]Eat your Pringles if you haven't taken a bite in like 10 minutes.
[160:34.98]Is this open?
[160:38.18]You guys are closed.
[160:41.30]Will you eat?
[160:41.88]Eat!
[160:42.20]Eat!
[160:50.04]Eat!
[160:50.50]Eat one!
[160:50.98]It's only 7.40.
[161:07.75]It's 8 o'clock at night.
[161:09.97]Alright, I'm going home.
[161:14.60]I'm gonna go write another book.
[161:19.44]Need my car.
[161:34.84]Go write porn too.
[161:36.16]They're just practice books.
[161:44.78]Oh dear, what happened?
[161:52.89]Take selfie with car.
[161:59.34]This guy is a dweeb.
[162:09.50]No flash.
[162:10.20]That guy really is a dweeb.
[162:14.61]Taking a selfie in the middle of the street with your sedan at 80 is dweeb behavior.
[162:43.34]Did I honk the horn?
[162:44.04]Get a seat.
[163:18.96]How do you honk?
[163:46.88]What's wrong?
[163:48.24]What's going on?
[163:49.34]Drake Lewis from the Lewis family has a needs gauge that is very low.
[163:55.13]Meow.
[163:55.47]What?
[163:55.65]How do you honk? ...
[164:19.49]I don't want to get in trouble.
[164:23.51]Get in.
[164:24.47]Get in!
[164:26.52]You too!
[164:50.88]No, no, no, no, no.
[164:51.60]Don't.
[164:52.10]Get in the back seat.
[164:54.93]If you go sing again, I'm fucking going to be pissed.
[164:57.37]Get in.
[165:02.35]Get in.
[165:09.26]No, stay in the car.
[165:15.82]Get in the front seat at least.
[165:21.37]Get in!
[165:25.87]No!
[165:26.07]Get in!
[165:50.82]He won't get in.
[165:51.42]Ooh.
[166:33.40]You can do that?!
[166:40.77]Seeker!
[166:42.23]Seekers!
[167:04.01]Why can you do that in the game?
[167:26.65]I'm shocked that that actually can happen.
[167:30.57]Like I turned into spaghetti and disappeared.
[167:34.18]No, but nothing happened.
[167:35.52]I didn't, nothing, I didn't get in trouble.
[167:37.26]Like, this guy didn't care.
[167:44.80]Nobody cared.
[167:51.95]I heard that you could hit people, but I didn't know it was that fucking drastic.
[167:55.37]That's insane.
[168:12.07]Uh oh!
[168:12.83]What do you mean there's rumors about me?
[168:18.89]Hot rumor is I saw a cool person today.
[168:21.84]Total number of views but the rumor was 10.
[168:36.86]Why are you taking a selfie at the scene of the crime?
[168:42.30]Oh shit, there is a cop right here.
[168:43.84]Is that bad?
[168:44.32]I gotta go to bed.
[168:50.79]He ran over a cool person today.
[169:02.44]I gotta get out of this.
[169:04.06]I gotta go home.
[169:05.08]I need to eat and I need to write another novel.
[169:11.04]I'm going home.
[169:20.17]I cannot believe that you can do that.
[169:22.08]So is that person just gone?
[169:23.62]I want to look that person up on my phone.
[169:30.14]Are they just not in my phone anymore?
[169:31.72]They're just gone.
[169:32.64]Forever.
[169:35.90]Does it say they're dead?
[169:37.30]Does it say they're gone?
[169:38.60]What does it say?
[169:42.94]That person's just deleted from the game?
[169:45.03]Does it say anything about it?
[169:55.57]What was their name?
[170:00.61]Check your karma thing?
[170:02.03]Oh no.
[170:03.55]It's probably really bad.
[170:08.23]It's probably really bad.
[170:09.67]I wonder where run guy over with car is on the karma meter.
[170:19.57]Alright, where the hell's my house?
[170:32.11]What are you doing?
[170:53.27]Okay, why would I do that if my house is right around the corner?
[170:57.09]Somebody in my house?
[171:04.98]Alright, eat and then go to bed.
[171:12.10]Have a microwave dinner.
[171:16.66]Quick meal.
[171:18.14]Let's have bibimbap.
[171:19.97]Sounds great.
[171:22.73]This is a really not tranquil life.
[171:24.51]No, it's not.
[171:25.07]Okay, I want to have somebody over the house tomorrow.
[171:43.41]You killed someone.
[171:47.07]I was trying to get the guy in the car.
[171:48.61]I was trying to have the guy... I wanted to go hang out with the guy and learn about his career of music and shit.
[172:10.02]No, does it get plus one letter grade?
[172:12.32]Yeah, it does.
[172:13.10]It does.
[172:14.48]That is an official plus one.
[172:23.90]The Sims?
[172:24.88]But you can run somebody over with your car?
[172:27.63]And it's not modded.
[172:28.95]What the fuck is that in the game for?
[172:30.67]That is unbelievable.
[172:36.21]Oh my god.
[172:42.92]When you're in the development and design kind of whiteboard room, right?
[172:48.63]Hey, uh, alright, so we have this life simulator.
[172:50.51]Yeah, life simulator.
[172:51.45]Alright, so we're gonna have hunger.
[172:52.63]We're gonna have hygiene.
[172:54.12]Yeah, you take a shower.
[172:55.12]Okay, yeah, that sounds good.
[172:55.96]Sleep.
[172:56.72]Rest.
[172:57.20]Sleep and rest.
[172:57.98]Comfort, too.
[172:58.58]Uh, what about ragdoll people getting hit by cars?
[173:03.38]Oh, yeah.
[173:03.86]I forgot about that one.
[173:04.68]Yeah, nice call.
[173:05.92]Nice call-out, for sure.
[173:06.67]Yeah, we're gonna have to have that, too.
[173:13.45]The mods of this game are gonna be insane.
[173:14.91]Okay.
[173:17.34]car accidents are part of the settings too he's mad they let him do something he wanted no I'm not I am not I'm just it's just sometimes you think about like oh man like there's cars in this game and you and you oh I bumped into somebody usually just kind of bounce off them they don't bounce off the car in ragdoll and are gone from the game forever
[173:48.57]Is there multiplayer?
[173:50.23]Can I invite somebody over?
[173:51.29]What if they just run me over?
[173:52.27]Am I just dead?
[173:53.13]Is there multiplayer in the game?
[173:55.27]I hate this guy.
[174:11.36]This is the worst character ever, by the way.
[174:15.78]You killed Johnny Garrett.
[174:17.72]Are you sure he's not still in my phone?
[174:20.86]I see Garrett.
[174:22.32]Garrett Benson.
[174:25.99]Russell Cannon.
[174:29.57]What was his name?
[174:30.21]Are you sure he's dead?
[174:34.05]You can attend his funeral.
[174:35.59]What?
[174:37.67]I want to play a card.
[174:39.72]What was that?
[174:47.23]Oh, my stomach hurts.

[175:29.52]Would you see that?
[175:36.41]Want to play a card game?
[175:42.92]Press M, go to Karma.
[176:00.61]Does anybody like me?
[176:03.35]I don't even like myself!
[176:05.11]Harm status caution.
[176:06.23]I don't see them anywhere.
[176:07.13]Souls.
[176:31.07]It's in their karma, not how much you like them.
[176:33.54]And it's family?
[176:37.88]You're supposed to be a dreamer.
[176:42.98]What the fuck is this?
[176:44.28]True.
[176:45.81]All families.
[176:46.51]Okay, hold on.
[176:47.29]What was his name?
[176:48.37]Garrett?
[177:04.76]Johnny Garrett.
[177:10.31]Is anybody else in the Garrett family?
[177:17.00]Don't I?
[177:17.58]I know a Garrett, don't I?
[177:18.92]Or is that a Garrett something?
[177:20.80]He's down here.
[177:34.24]That's awful.
[177:35.70]Oh, that's awful.
[177:40.70]That's terrible.
[177:44.02]Oh, that's terrible.
[177:47.07]That's awful.
[177:58.31]Sleeping like a baby, somebody said.
[178:00.49]I didn't mean to.
[178:02.19]Alright, I've got maybe a little.
[178:09.29]you ended an entire bloodline oh that's too stupid it's too funny
[178:39.38]Am I going to get up on my own?
[178:51.77]Why is it so dirty?
[178:53.13]I don't understand.
[178:54.87]Why is it so dirty?
[178:56.36]Why is the bed so dirty?
[178:59.36]What did I do?
[179:02.23]This is like you sleep in this bed for like two years without cleaning the sheets.
[179:07.59]It's been three days, guys.
[179:10.65]It's been three days.
[179:12.23]It's not been like ten years.
[179:15.06]This is disgusting.
[179:21.24]Take care of this.
[179:30.12]I don't think that worked.
[179:39.23]Here we go.
[179:39.53]Alright, vacuum, vacuum, vacuum, vacuum.
[179:48.67]I guess I went to the beach.
[179:50.59]Is that that much of a problem?

[180:19.47]That sounds good.
[180:26.34]Let's go to the bathroom.
[180:28.72]I've not had to take a shower in days.
[180:32.30]I don't even have a shower.
[180:38.39]That was disgusting too.
[180:39.33]Look at this.
[180:42.64]I thought this was part of the design of the bathtub.
[180:45.16]I thought it was like a smoky charcoal or something.
[180:49.34]I didn't know that that was dirty.
[181:07.10]Is this dirty or is this clean?
[181:13.28]Oh my God, I just burped in the microphone.
[181:14.70]I'm sorry.
[181:14.96]I keep thinking about that guy singing.
[181:26.57]And ending his bloodline.
[181:28.03]This game is so stupid.
[181:33.01]I love it.
[181:43.44]I haven't even built any houses or anything yet.
[181:45.08]I've just been fucking around as an old guy.
[182:02.95]Aggressively brushing his teeth.
[182:13.74]Not accurate unless you see that.
[182:32.46]Practice speaking.
[182:33.50]Alright, we'll go to the beach after the break.
[182:37.39]Break is coming up here in a minute.
[182:42.47]I got almost level 3 performance.
[182:46.01]I can't even think about it anymore.
[183:04.57]That was... Highly reactive, corrosive and toxic.
[183:11.90]What the hell is that?
[183:13.08]Why would I do that?
[183:14.68]Just made a mess to clean up later.
[183:15.91]Alright, I'll be right back.

[191:13.84]I'm just going to have a beach day.
[191:43.06]Why do you look like a freak?
[191:44.62]I told you, I look like a foam version of a person.
[191:51.45]Wait, I can be a gym bro?
[191:55.49]Wait a minute.
[191:55.99]Are you kidding me?
[191:56.83]Hmm.
[192:13.03]Who is that?
[192:21.78]One?
[192:21.94]Alright.
[192:26.36]I did not like that at all.
[192:27.76]Apparently I have to go to the bathroom.
[192:29.85]Did I shit my pants lifting that?
[192:36.25]Oh no.
[192:38.25]That is a stance you make if you did shit your pants.
[192:58.50]We're good.
[192:58.84]We made it.
[192:59.16]Alright, now I need a beach hot dog or something.

[193:25.19]Okay.
[193:33.38]Practice dribbling.
[193:36.76]Practice shooting.
[193:38.90]You cannot use this?
[193:40.56]Why?
[193:40.90]Am I too old to use the basketball hoop?
[193:45.79]I'm too old.
[193:51.37]You want to smell a house plant.
[193:56.68]That's a very strange thing to want to do.
[194:04.76]Alright, I need a food truck or something.
[194:07.62]I need some beach food.
[194:12.34]There you go, the king claw.

[195:01.90]Alright, who wants to go swimming?
[195:05.60]Can I get a group of people to go swimming?

[195:16.71]Yeah.
[195:19.53]And we're talking like a mid-tier SNL skit character.
[195:27.17]You know the ones that maybe they do two or three skits with this character and then it just never shows up again?

[196:11.15]Can I make food?
[196:11.85]What can I do with this?
[196:14.80]Sit by the fire.

[198:05.07]Okay, can you stop sniffing it?
[198:06.87]He's smelling it like a weirdo.
[198:08.63]He didn't even eat it.
[198:15.54]I don't care about going to the golden apple burger at my scheduled old person time.
[198:20.12]Let's sprinkle magical dust in it.
[198:32.29]That was kind of cool.

[199:49.06]Do you have any selection or any colors or anything that you'd recommend?
[199:52.08]How's it going?
[200:03.98]I got a pretty nice hairstyle.
[200:05.06]I think mine looks good.
[200:07.97]I like that hairstyle a lot.
[200:09.31]That hairstyle is good on you too.
[200:11.47]I like all kinds of hair.
[200:14.49]Actually, my grandson had this haircut.
[200:20.75]And let me tell you how many times he slammed the door in my face.

[200:29.03]It's called Build the Fort.
[200:30.85]But I'm trying to connect with him a little bit more.
[200:33.76]I figured if I had his exact haircut and a head size, five times his head size... There he is, right there.
[200:41.01]See?
[200:42.31]Not a great photo, but, you know, you get the idea.

[205:41.30]Whatever.
[205:41.68]The three tildes.

[206:09.65]I'm so bad at texting.
[206:10.65]I really am.
[206:11.69]I'm so bad at anything that's written down.
[206:21.39]How do I call somebody?
[206:30.90]Shit.
[206:45.56]I can't call anybody?
[206:51.40]And I can't say anything either?
[206:52.38]There's got to be a way.
[206:59.56]Why can't I type in this box if I can't?
[207:01.69]In development.
[207:03.69]Oh, shit.
[207:04.65]Okay, never mind.
[207:05.37]Alright, I want to go swimming.
[207:12.65]Is there actually a way I can go swimming?
[207:16.76]The dock, maybe?
[207:33.35]You got blocked by AI.
[207:39.50]Can I swim over here?
[207:46.07]Oh, that looked kind of, this looks kind of nice.
[208:15.48]I'm just waiting for the eyes to just boom open with scary music.

[208:38.78]Please.

[209:05.41]Let me swim!
[209:06.13]Come on!
[209:23.11]Are we in a boat?
[209:26.87]Oh, it's a fishing spot.
[209:30.58]Fish with advanced bait.
[209:55.82]Did I do anything?
[209:56.42]I spent five dollars to do nothing.
[210:01.56]This doesn't seem like a good fishing spot.
[210:03.54]Wow, it's a big catch.
[210:06.44]What?
[210:33.23]He's glistening.
[211:05.74]Fine, I'll do it myself.
[211:16.28]Uh-oh.
[211:17.24]Oh, okay, wait, wait, here it comes.
[211:38.57]He wants to read a novel?
[212:11.27]How do you swim?
[212:12.19]Somebody told me to come here to swim in my jeans, but I can't swim.
[212:20.52]Oh, I hate these.
[212:28.01]This might be a weird take for a lot of you guys.
[212:32.31]I would honestly rather shit my pants than use one of these.
[212:43.67]opening that door and getting that combination of smells which is chemical cleaner mixed with 25 different people's excrement mixed with plastic it is it is generally the most upsetting place on Earth I think
[213:20.58]Oh my goodness.
[213:26.61]You'd be lucky if there's any chemical cleaner in there.
[213:29.37]It's just such a... There's one thing that I cannot... I can't... Peeing?
[213:36.05]Okay, urination?
[213:37.21]That's fine.
[213:39.13]Absolutely nothing else.
[213:44.56]You never would have survived the 1800s.
[213:49.84]Mysterious trash can?
[213:55.58]What's in the mysterious trash can?
[214:02.64]What do I do with this?
[214:09.02]Oh, that's not that big of a deal.
[214:10.58]There's like a thousand of them.
[214:16.93]Yeah, I can't think of a more disgusting thing to do.
[214:22.19]I am a, I hate public bathrooms.
[214:23.99]I really just do.
[214:25.77]You know what one thing, I know that Larry David did an episode on this, but I would go even further.
[214:32.36]I would love to just redo the public bathroom.
[214:41.06]She's burning.
[214:41.82]Oh, you probably shouldn't stand there.
[214:53.01]I would want there to be nice- I would want there to be classical music playing.
[214:58.34]Individual stalls with individual doors.
[215:02.26]You guys ever seen, um, was it in Sweden or Switzerland or something?
[215:06.56]The public bathrooms, they- they go- they literally submerge them in water like a fish tank and with a cleaning fluid and just- The toilet moves back and they just like dump water all over the place and cleaner everywhere.
[215:19.83]It like cleans itself after every use.
[215:21.85]I don't know wherever it is.
[215:29.01]Drink water from what?
[215:29.99]The ocean?
[215:30.43]Those are real?
[215:37.16]Yeah.
[215:37.48]Is it Japan?
[215:38.02]I thought it was somewhere in Europe.
[215:39.98]Did they reuse the cleaning water?
[215:46.36]I would imagine maybe.
[215:48.12]Maybe it's... Is it sustainable?
[215:49.12]I don't know.
[215:51.80]You put a scuba suit on to take a shit?
[215:54.46]I'm sorry, man.
[215:55.25]I'm just telling you, I... I just can't.
[215:58.83]Can't do it.
[216:12.14]25 gallons of water to take a piss?
[216:14.12]No, I'm... Peeing is fine.
[216:16.56]I have nothing wrong with doing that.
[216:20.08]But the second that it's like, I have to use that bathroom, and I'm going to be in there for more than a few minutes, the violins, the horror movie violins start to play in my head.
[216:32.09]You know the one.
[216:49.41]I want to have a meaningful friendship or relationship with somebody.
[216:53.32]Wait, I have a president at my house.

[223:38.22]That package is long gone.
[223:39.48]Am I waiting for the bus?
[223:42.50]I have a car.
[224:13.32]I'm going to drive.
[224:15.28]Seems like a nice night to drive around.
[224:16.48]Take a look.
[224:24.43]Whoa.
[224:29.87]You need an iPhone for the face tracker?
[224:31.65]Oh, shit.

[225:52.56]This should be packages here.
[225:53.46]Yep.
[225:57.58]That's a little weird.
[225:58.22]Why is there a baseball bat?
[226:07.78]Oh my god!
[226:08.72]I'm gonna fucking shatter somebody's window!
[226:12.84]Yo, what the fuck, man?
[226:14.96]Don't do that!
[226:16.52]Holy shit!
[226:19.26]Fragile parcel.
[226:26.81]And it is a super surprise box.
[226:39.66]Alright.
[226:40.94]Cool.
[226:50.09]Who even gave this to me?
[226:53.93]I thought I was going to eat this.
[227:01.26]Alright, will you stop walking around and carrying around like a weird, like, Dark Souls character?
[227:05.81]Like a, like, Igor from fucking Frankenstein?
[227:08.31]What am I doing?
[227:10.81]Holding it like it's a candle.
[227:18.33]I want to repair a broken item.
[227:19.63]Alright, there's another one here.
[227:32.05]Alright, so I call both of them over and see.
[227:34.25]Oh, you got me a cat doll.
[227:39.87]Is this a cat doll or this is not a. It's not a stuffed cat, right?
[227:45.39]That would be very weird.
[227:46.30]I hope it's a doll.
[228:02.32]Put it around on the kitchen counter.
[228:08.44]Okay.
[228:15.32]I'm gonna sleep and then I'm gonna call them over.
[228:18.45]We're gonna have a friend hangout time.
[228:39.06]Good night's sleep, it'll be... Ah shit, I'm hungry, damn it.
[228:47.21]Yeah, I know, I ran a guy over and I erased his entire bloodline.
[228:51.44]I get it.
[228:52.82]You don't gotta remind me about it every ten minutes.
[229:11.64]I think that's enough sleep.
[229:14.20]Let's be like a true old person and get up at like 4.30.
[229:16.31]The haircut is the worst crime.
[229:24.65]That's true.

[293:57.71]Nora?
[294:04.01]She's not even on the list.
[294:07.33]Oh, there you are.
[294:17.03]Apparently we're in love.

[294:56.18]Okay, here we go.

[295:08.54]Oh, you got me a... How did I get it?
[295:11.91]What is that?
[295:38.11]She doesn't know what to do.
[295:39.61]She does not know what to do here.
[295:41.91]She is stuck in this scenario where she's like, I don't know what to do.
[295:45.49]He gave me this fucked up thing.
[295:46.53]I don't know how to respond to this.
[295:48.03]What do I say?
[295:51.67]What do I have in my inventory?
[295:56.31]What am I doing?
[295:56.89]I'm taking a shit right now.
[296:06.67]OK.
[296:07.99]Now wash the hands.
[296:11.29]And romance.
[296:13.87]Pick up line.
[296:23.40]Try this again.
[296:35.26]There we are.
[296:40.37]Yeah.
[296:42.05]Receptive.
[296:45.35]Yep.
[296:53.81]Should we do... Should we go for a hold hands and talk?
[297:02.47]The date's almost over.
[297:09.16]Okay.
[297:09.30]Alright, should we go for... Let's see if we can... How about a... How about a kiss?
[297:23.71]Should we go for it?
[297:46.63]Let's take a group photo.
[298:03.02]Oh, great.
[298:04.98]Real good.
[298:09.96]Excellent.
[298:10.58]Okay, great.
[298:17.16]excellent look good whoa that freaked me out that was weird confess love wait wait before you leave wait uh Jennifer I forgot her name Nora Nora wait Nora
[298:53.25]Sorry, I'll call her tomorrow.
[298:56.09]Got any more of those bacon cheeseburgers I can take for the road?
[299:08.74]Wait.
[299:10.52]Um.
[299:12.98]I think I fucked the game up because I'm in here when it's closed.
[299:20.44]Oh no, we're good.
[299:32.48]Where are you?
[299:42.95]You declined to make plans with me?
[299:44.50]What the hell?
[299:47.66]Why?
[300:02.93]We got the last break in the night probably coming up here.
[300:06.51]I'll play for like another 30-40 minutes.
[300:23.58]I think the game has potential.
[300:24.74]I think it's really... You can't drive the vehicle because you're not its owner.
[300:30.84]What do you mean I'm not the owner?
[300:34.47]Did my car get repossessed or something?
[300:38.41]What does that mean?
[300:38.87]Okay, whatever.
[300:46.59]I haven't really done any of the building.
[300:47.77]I kind of just been walking around insulting people.
[300:52.26]But that's been fun.
[300:57.72]You can drive a car and you can run people over and kill them.
[301:06.35]I didn't want to go right there because I feel like if you start doing that, then it's over.
[301:11.00]It's like modding Skyrim.
[301:13.78]You can't go play vanilla Skyrim ever again.
[301:17.98]And I don't think I want to wipe out the whole town.
[301:25.29]That dog has been sitting there for five hours straight.
[301:32.84]Because when a Zoe dies in the game, they die in real life in the game.
[301:36.62]In real life in the game.
[301:38.75]And I don't want to... I don't want to get rid of all these people.
[301:43.23]I'm going to go to sleep.
[301:43.73]I'm going to call her over and we're going to try this again.
[301:56.17]Oh man, come on.
[302:21.24]Karma status.
[302:22.90]How bad is it right now?
[302:31.37]Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[302:36.17]My soul dashboard is not awful.
[302:37.69]I've had a lot of good moments.
[302:45.54]I've had a lot of normal moments and only one terrible moment.
[303:03.87]It's more neutral bad than it was earlier in the game.
[303:08.19]I think I did okay.
[303:11.81]For a first character ever.
[303:12.91]For running somebody over and starving 15 people at a party accidentally.
[303:22.30]Yeah, here's the last BRB of the night.
[303:24.38]I will be back.
[303:25.08]We will continue.
[303:27.78]And we'll see how it goes.
[303:29.16]I'll be right back.
[304:25.03]Thanks for watching!
[306:43.24]Back.
[306:49.19]About 15 more seconds for the ads to end.
[306:53.79]We can kind of get the end of this arc of Drake Lewis.
[307:08.13]How you doing?
[307:11.80]Alright, this is the final day.
[307:13.02]I'm going to try to get Nora to come over.
[307:17.99]Hang out.
[307:32.29]No Chrono Trigger.
[307:33.47]Yeah.
[307:35.66]We'll get there though.
[307:40.66]He's just snoring.
[307:53.20]Kind of sell the disco ball at this point.
[308:09.21]Did you run over anyone in the game yet?
[308:11.71]Yes, I did.
[308:15.96]It was a whole lot of context around though, so you're gonna have to watch the VOD.
[308:31.15]Would you say you're happy with your purchase of this game?
[308:35.79]yeah I mean it's it's I haven't really played a whole lot of it yet it is early access so I don't know how long it's going to be there for that's something to keep in mind I think that what's here has been really funny and really fun I've been I've been enjoying myself it's been fun but I haven't really tapped into very much else
[309:07.51]This was government funded party equipment.
[309:12.33]I didn't even turn the smoke machines on.
[309:13.93]They didn't even do anything.
[309:14.89]How do you turn them on?
[309:15.63]I mean, I will say it's not, it's good to, I think, have some competition in the space.
[309:24.98]Like forever it's been the life simulation genre.
[309:28.06]It's been The Sims, The Sims, The Sims and The Sims 4 and The Sims 4.
[309:36.32]We'll see.
[309:37.58]I don't know what this game looks like six months from now.
[309:40.56]But... I think I've enjoyed the time today.
[309:47.20]And you can drive a car, so that gets a full letter grade.
[309:54.69]I'm sorry.
[309:55.99]I don't make the rules.
[309:56.89]I just made that one rule like five years ago.
[310:11.05]Body sound congested.
[310:13.77]Sometimes when I laugh a lot at something, my sinuses and my throat are just kind of junked up for like the next two hours.
[310:34.97]Getting old.
[310:38.19]Something like that, maybe.
[310:41.78]I feel like the last two streams has just been... I've... That laughing muscle has gone off like eight times.
[310:48.95]Like ten times.
[310:50.45]For like a minute straight.
[310:53.05]That's eight... That's like ten straight minutes of that like... muscle.
[310:58.50]Maybe 20 straight minutes.
[311:03.08]It's been worked out pretty recently, so...
[311:07.26]Alright, let me see.
[311:07.94]I'm going to go into the date.
[311:10.14]Let me take a bath.
[311:10.82]We're going to try to have a meaningful connection.
[311:32.07]I think the customization, I'll tell you, the customization seems crazy.
[311:41.62]So if you wanted that kind of differentiating factor, actually making your character is, you can really make some wild stuff.
[311:57.09]And that's honestly where I have the most fun in these games is making something just that I think is interesting.
[312:03.18]And it feels like you can make a lot of interesting people.
[312:14.91]Also, there's apparently face tracking where you can connect your camera.
[312:18.43]And as I'm moving my mouth and face, you can see the expressions move.
[312:22.37]And I'm stuck in the toilet right now.
[312:30.49]Also, WASD does kind of change things.
[312:33.03]It makes it feel like a different game.
[312:35.88]I've not been really... The Sims, I treat like an RTS in a way.
[312:40.76]Adding the WASD.
[312:42.94]This is an adventure game now.
[312:45.28]I'm not even doing... I haven't done any of the building.
[312:46.98]I haven't even cared about it at all.
[312:51.36]Inzoy feels like I am playing an adventure simulation game.
[312:59.04]I guess take that as you will.
[313:02.18]You can click and move as well.
[313:03.46]Yep, you can.
[313:05.12]It's way easier to move around with WASD though.
[313:13.25]Alright, let's go date night.
[313:23.39]I can't select date?
[313:25.25]Does she not want to go on a date with me anymore?
[313:31.02]But wait, does she work at the...
[313:44.01]She works at the music fortune teller, right?
[313:49.58]Date to the bank.
[314:15.25]You're gonna bother your estranged lover at work?
[314:19.27]No, I just don't know how to call somebody.
[314:20.77]Is this normal behavior?
[314:34.30]This is the only normal behavior in- in ZOIG is I can't- I don't know how to call somebody.
[314:42.57]Slow down, holy shit.
[314:53.28]It's closed.
[315:04.13]It's 7 AM.
[315:04.95]Oh, it is 7 AM.
[315:06.75]Damn it.
[315:13.89]No, this is weird.
[315:14.61]I don't want to wait till she opens.
[315:15.89]That's weird.
[315:16.35]I don't like that.
[315:22.50]It opens in three minutes?
[315:29.82]Why did this person send me a present?
[315:32.27]It's gonna be like a paper bag with shit in it.
[315:48.59]Is she even here?
[316:15.58]I don't know.
[316:15.96]How come there's nobody here?
[316:18.68]Oh, I can smell it.
[316:28.98]I don't like this.
[316:29.80]I'm out of here.
[316:32.24]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[316:37.04]I'm not going to sit there and smell an old dinner or something.
[316:40.35]That's fucking messed up.
[316:49.12]Can I get a reading?
[316:51.98]Can I read the cards myself?
[317:02.22]What?
[317:03.86]This place smells!
[317:06.90]Aha!
[317:08.71]Konza!
[317:08.91]Lubyalami!
[317:35.11]You should prepare for marriage right away!
[318:15.52]can I do a hangout like a party can I throw a party at the fortune teller what no it's just me one minimum of one
[318:55.34]How about... somebody else's house?
[318:57.64]Select the guests?
[318:59.22]I don't think I could, could I?
[319:01.76]Oh shit, okay.
[319:28.51]Throwing a party at somebody else's house.
[319:31.23]Will she get a shitload of business from this?
[319:33.21]You can actually do this.
[319:54.54]Yeah, I'm the marketing guy.
[319:56.44]Josh saying, you're not throwing a party.
[319:58.74]You're the marketing guy.
[319:59.58]Did it work?
[320:06.87]Wait, did I not confirm it?
[320:16.30]It's in 20 minutes.
[320:16.92]Okay.
[320:36.89]Why can't you throw a party?
[320:37.85]It's somebody else's business.
[320:38.99]That is insane.
[320:41.45]I guess she's cool with it.
[320:42.89]She's coming.
[320:43.43]Here we go.
[321:06.42]This is going to be awful.
[321:26.62]Is he going to get his fortune?
[321:27.58]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[321:28.28]I actually am the marketer.
[321:30.44]They're all going to get their fortune read right now in a row.
[321:32.36]The fisherman.
[321:33.18]I love how the fisherman is here.
[321:38.65]Confess my love?
[321:39.79]I didn't say that.
[321:42.79]He's just doing it.
[321:56.84]They are all loading.
[322:24.90]let's talk first make sure the things are still fine how about like a bouquet
[322:43.10]I think there's just too many people in here.
[322:46.57]Choose a relationship conversation right now.
[323:10.97]just like say hello like ask about we just went on a date yesterday we had a kiss it was a nice time and then she left and then I left and then it's like okay so what are we pursuing this or how are you doing already a coffer right should I just confess

[326:12.37]Oh shit, just get on the bus.
[326:18.48]Fuck!
[326:20.48]Alright, I think that's it.
[326:28.44]That's it.
[326:30.54]That was the inzoi.
[326:32.02]He was pretty goofy.
[326:35.80]But yeah, that was fun.
[326:36.54]Only one person died, which is maybe surprising to some of you.
[326:38.64]Let's turn this off.
[326:40.88]I'm gonna save it, just in case.
[327:04.72]I think the game crashed, unfortunately.
[327:11.46]That was a fun one, though.
[327:12.16]I had a good time.
[327:13.06]Hope everybody had fun, too.
[327:16.59]Next stream, there might be one tomorrow night.
[327:20.29]I'm not doing an April Fool's thing.
[327:22.27]It just would be like, haha, I'm streaming.
[327:23.83]Isn't that funny?
[327:26.01]If not tomorrow, then I will see you on Wednesday.
[327:30.55]All the streams that are happening in the next few days will be in the evening.
[327:35.89]So at least a 5 to 6 p.m.
[327:39.85]start.
[327:40.15]They're going to be late night streams.
[327:44.89]So if there is one tomorrow, it won't be until at least 5 or 6 o'clock.
[327:56.00]And that's Pacific time, so that's 8 or 9 p.m.
[327:59.18]Eastern.
[328:08.14]I don't know what I'm going to play.
[328:08.96]I was going to actually, before Enzoe, I was thinking about doing that Fly Barker game, Undying.
[328:16.77]I got a grab bag of old games I want to just play for fun, so.
[328:32.38]Dark Souls 3 with Ster.
[328:33.74]Yeah, and maybe in Etalyx just never even finished split fiction.
[328:37.17]But I don't know.
[328:39.01]That might not even happen anymore.
[328:40.39]I don't know.
[328:47.50]And Dark Souls 3.
[328:48.20]I don't know.
[328:48.54]We talked about it.
[328:49.10]We said maybe.
[328:54.02]I have a Monster Rancher to little tournament to get ready.
[328:58.76]As well as.
[329:01.28]I want to play the Warcraft 3 custom games.
[329:06.03]I know that the Horseman also had interest in that too.
[329:12.75]I'm talking stuff like Uther Party, Hero Line War.
[329:16.37]I think it'd be really fun.
[329:23.26]Dracula 3, also absolutely.
[329:31.90]I don't think I want to play regular Warcraft 3, it's a little too involved, but playing Uther Party is... is much, much easier for my brain.
[329:53.13]Voices of the Void, that's another one too.
[329:59.39]Hey, all these things you guys are bringing up is great because there's just a lot of things to play and just hang out and do.
[330:05.30]So I'm all for it.
[330:10.32]Have a good rest of your night.
[330:11.32]Call your mother.
[330:12.30]See you soon.
[330:14.58]I'll see you in a day or two.
[330:17.84]Bye-bye.
[331:00.31]you
