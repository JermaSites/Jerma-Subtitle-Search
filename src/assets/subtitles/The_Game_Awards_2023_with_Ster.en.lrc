[ve:60.16.100]

[00:16.57]Yeah, I'm here.
[00:18.59]I'm here early.
[00:20.01]Two minutes early before it starts.
[00:22.37]I gotta be ready.
[00:27.06]I'm not.
[00:27.66]I'm not missing the previews this time.
[00:30.34]Just telling you.
[00:33.32]Not this time.
[00:36.65]You should play Lego Fortnite.
[00:41.89]What is going on with Fortnite by the way?
[00:52.41]What's going on with that game?
[01:00.23]I saw Peter Griffin's in the game now.
[01:01.99]I mean, that's amazing, but.
[01:08.94]They're going to run out of characters.
[01:11.12]How many more characters can they do?
[01:13.32]Besides the three stooges.
[01:15.79]That might actually happen.
[01:17.85]Guys, if Fortnite is popular for like another 20 years, they're going to get added to the game because they're going to... What was that?
[01:24.71]Did you hear that?
[01:26.27]What's going on?
[01:29.20]My headphones are yelling at me.
[01:31.00]They just said quiet, aware.
[01:35.78]What?
[01:38.54]Oh, I think I touched one of the things that makes it... Hold on a minute.
[01:42.21]Oh, no, that was awareness mode.
[01:43.83]Now I can hear through my right side.
[01:45.77]I got new headphones.
[01:49.03]Aware.
[01:50.97]But yeah, they're going to run out of characters.
[01:53.59]They'll get to a point where there's nobody left.
[01:58.07]Oh, shit.
[01:58.55]Well, what about Superman?
[02:00.17]He's in the game.
[02:01.69]Uh, what about Tommy Pickles from Rugrats?
[02:05.58]They're in the game.
[02:07.04]Oh, shit.
[02:07.68]Um...
[02:12.02]How about the three stooges?
[02:14.30]Sir, the three stooges are not in the game.
[02:17.76]Ooh, and there's nostalgia there.
[02:20.05]Oh, it's old.
[02:21.23]Let's make them black and white.
[02:22.31]You know what I mean?
[02:23.91]All three of them are just completely monochrome, black and white.
[02:28.21]Sir, that's a great idea.
[02:32.93]Starting?
[02:34.29]Oh, no, it's not.
[02:35.31]I don't see it.
[02:35.83]It's not starting.
[02:38.55]Where is it?
[02:43.35]Oh, hey, Grotto Beasts!
[02:45.18]I forgot.
[02:45.84]Hey!
[02:47.06]By the way, everybody, let me take this opportunity real quick to say that the grotto... I should have done this two minutes ago.
[02:58.38]Okay, hold on.
[02:58.98]Let me see if it's there.
[03:04.18]Where is it?
[03:04.66]It's not starting.
[03:07.32]It says it's live, but I don't have anything here.
[03:08.92]It says offline.
[03:13.82]I don't have anything.
[03:14.48]I'm on the Twitch page.
[03:19.40]The Twitch page is still offline.
[03:21.62]Refresh it again.
[03:25.20]Where is it?
[03:27.70]Offline.
[03:30.68]Just go to YouTube.
[03:34.30]Bro, it's probably 8.
[03:35.12]It's not 8.
[03:41.77]Just refresh it.
[03:42.79]I just did like three times.

[03:45.37]It's coming.
[03:45.79]It's coming.
[03:46.17]It's coming.
[03:46.53]Don't worry.
[03:48.51]It's coming.
[03:52.26]What the fuck?
[03:56.00]It literally is.
[03:57.70]You're missing it.
[03:58.46]I'm not missing anything.
[03:59.84]Why is it not on Twitch?
[04:00.70]Is it not on Twitch?
[04:02.18]Why does it say December 7th here?
[04:04.46]It says December 7th.
[04:06.19]No way.
[04:07.59]Just be patient.
[04:10.19]It hasn't started yet.
[04:13.33]It's on Twitch right now.
[04:14.63]What's going on with my computer then?
[04:17.83]What's going on with my computer?
[04:18.89]I have an ad.
[04:23.78]I just got an ad.
[04:24.74]I just got an ad.
[04:25.70]Here it comes.
[04:26.04]You want to hear the ad?
[04:33.18]Without looking, that could be anything.
[04:34.89]I don't know what it is.
[04:35.77]I'm not looking.
[04:38.75]It could be anything.
[04:42.20]just it's a song it could be anything uh oh wait it's Google Super Mario brothers wonder what the wait it is live why is it why did this just start now on my computer Super Mario brothers wonder dude Super Mario brothers wonder just won best family game and I missed it what hold on
[05:03.99]What is going on here?
[05:05.11]Thank you so much for this award.
[05:07.37]This is shared with all the teams at Nintendo that worked on.
[05:11.25]I got it.
[05:11.87]I got it.
[05:14.39]In my experience, the team really tried to develop a game that allowed people to work together, to play together, whether it was friends or it was family.
[05:23.14]And for me,
[05:24.18]My personal experience is nothing brings a family together more than trying to rescue an empire, a kingdom in distress from the evil likes of Bowser.
[05:35.19]Whether you're playing as Elephant Mario, Peach, Yoshi, or an Abbot, this game goes to everyone that created it.
[05:43.89]You know, I got this game, but I only played it for about five minutes before Mario RPG came out, and that's the only thing I did.
[05:51.25]congratulations Super Mario brothers wonder and now I have a little treat for all of you three world premieres in a row what what first up is the next game about this for a world premiere the creator of the tga nominated independent game uh my face cam doesn't work either apparently never mind
[06:20.60]You were doing browser source before?
[06:21.94]Yeah, I was.
[06:23.04]Is this in HD?
[06:30.87]720p?
[06:31.07]It is?
[06:31.25]It's 720p?
[06:31.95]I gotta shut up.
[06:58.07]Hey, we're focusing on the game right now.
[07:00.46]This looks kind of sick.
[07:04.69]Just wait a second, baby.
[07:30.26]what is going on 2026. I don't know what was happening
[07:59.21]Who do you guys think is gonna win game of the year?
[08:02.69]I think it's gonna be probably Tears of the Kingdom.
[08:07.19]Or... Let's listen to that part.
[08:19.84]Is there watermarks on this?
[08:21.88]Oh no, okay.
[08:29.14]What do I actually think?
[08:31.54]My opinion is going to be an opinion that's a weird one because it's like probably 12 people on Earth have this opinion.
[08:37.67]Maybe times that by 100.
[08:39.59]Maybe like by about 200.
[08:40.67]But I think Pizza Tower was the game of the year.
[08:43.87]We're talking about unique, interesting.
[08:46.05]I would say Resident Evil 4, but that's a remake.
[08:49.54]I'm going to give it a Pizza Tower.
[08:50.88]Pizza Tower gets game of the year.
[08:53.36]But you don't need to watch the rest of this.
[08:57.34]Alright, what's this?
[09:04.53]Don't drop it, don't drop it, don't drop it!
[09:14.62]They're all good.
[09:17.82]They're all good.
[09:33.44]Yeah, this is, this is, well, they're just starting.
[09:45.85]We're too late.
[09:49.29]We all are.
[09:50.01]Let me fix my webcam.
[09:51.13]What's going on?
[10:00.10]What happens if I reactivate it?
[10:01.60]Hey, there we go.
[10:02.50]Gaming on TikTok right now?
[10:03.44]All I got is a chair.
[10:04.30]I don't got anything else, guys.
[10:30.28]don't skip this cutscene people but something that I what's wrong what the journey ended here
[10:40.29]We breached the cosmic veil and reached a new planet.
[10:45.97]What is wrong with this thing?
[10:47.51]Yet generations later, this world remains untamed.
[10:52.03]If that happens after 10 seconds, I got a great joke for Game of the Year when I scream and my TikTok win and my whole computer crashes and shit because I freak out about it.
[11:02.60]Hold that, Jillian.
[11:13.79]I don't know why this is happening.
[11:18.15]What is this, though?
[11:28.47]Go to?
[11:28.71]Open this one.
[11:31.25]Would it be there?
[11:33.59]I want the 1080p experience.
[11:37.87]Oh, here we go.
[11:39.77]Okay, I think I can get it a little better.
[11:47.93]4k up on YouTube.
[11:49.15]Let me get it on YouTube.
[11:52.46]This game is actually fun.
[12:07.95]This one here.
[12:17.37]This looks crazy.
[12:19.85]Let me get a different link.
[12:21.31]Sir is ready.
[12:23.97]Sir, I thought you weren't doing this thing.
[12:25.84]I'm going to say what he has to say.
[12:28.00]I don't know if he's there or not.
[12:41.02]To restore the dynasty to its former glory.
[12:45.06]To reclaim what humanity has lost.
[12:48.95]To venture forth into darkness and bring the light of the age.
[12:53.68]Hey, what's up?
[12:57.15]Hey, how's it going?
[12:59.05]People can't really hear you.
[13:01.60]Hold on a second.
[13:02.76]What's up, bro?
[13:05.26]Hey, why does Twitch have a 720p feed of this and YouTube has a 4K feed of this?
[13:11.20]Yeah, I'm on YouTube.
[13:13.60]I'd recommend going to YouTube.
[13:16.31]Why is this?
[13:17.77]Okay, well, are you watching it right now?
[13:20.41]Don't spoil anything if you're ahead of us.
[13:23.05]I think the YouTube feed is slightly behind the Twitch feed when I'm watching on YouTube.
[13:27.22]oh okay alright game awards let's go I'm gonna turn this down because it might be really loud let's try this good thing for you that I'm here then today you ought to see a traitor to the crowd are you by the neck for his crime I'm here microphone on Discord you kind of sound like a muffled
[13:53.63]Do I?
[13:54.19]Oh, that might be my webcam.
[13:55.35]My webcam keeps breaking, man.
[13:56.57]I don't know what the fuck's going on.
[13:58.25]Oh, that's crazy.
[13:59.13]It doesn't make any sense.
[14:01.83]I don't know.
[14:02.31]What are you going to do?
[14:03.67]Shut up.
[14:04.03]What?
[14:05.79]In the end, the Templars will succeed.
[14:10.93]Does this sound better?
[14:12.15]Yes, that sounds way better.
[14:13.33]Okay, because it's going to turn my head around.
[14:15.13]Is this the right mic?
[14:16.86]Hold on.
[14:17.20]I'm getting it on YouTube, and I'm moving it over here.
[14:19.26]Okay.
[14:21.06]I believe you.
[14:23.82]This isn't 4K over on YouTube.
[14:26.32]What the fuck?
[14:27.01]Alright, hold on.
[14:31.89]How do they do it?
[14:32.49]I don't know.
[14:33.95]But here, entertain them for a second because they're not going to be able to hear it for a second.
[14:38.64]no they can't hear the game they can't see anything right now okay so so I can't just no you can be audio fun though okay do you hear the uh the cancelled Twitch in Korea too
[15:00.47]Is that better?
[15:01.13]Yeah, I heard about that.
[15:02.27]That's crazy.
[15:02.71]That's very crazy.
[15:03.75]This is 4K.
[15:04.03]Alright.
[15:04.37]Hey, Star, how are you?
[15:19.52]Are you watching my stream?
[15:20.40]Because I can't get my cam on.
[15:21.58]Yeah, I know.
[15:22.16]Webcams, they just break.
[15:23.62]They're like two weeks and they're done.
[15:25.29]I don't know what happened to them.
[15:26.35]Stop talking over the ruler.
[15:27.35]What do you want from me?
[15:28.17]High-five Rush.
[15:39.40]Marvel's Spider-Man 2.
[15:40.40]Diablo 4 wins this because even a 12-year-old could play it.
[15:44.64]A two-year-old, I meant.
[15:45.69]Shut up.
[15:46.19]Forza Motorsport.
[15:46.73]Okay, I can see that.
[15:59.95]Thank you so much for this.
[16:01.93]Have you played Forza?
[16:03.59]I was going to ask you who said I could see that.
[16:05.99]Have you played Forza?
[16:07.25]Well, I mean, there's a lot of accessibility features for driving.
[16:13.68]Hey, you're talking over her.
[16:14.78]At this point, I think we've made the most accessible racing game ever playable by people across the mobility and vision spectrum, including totally blind players.
[16:23.26]There's a big moment.
[16:24.00]The real winners here are the players.
[16:25.84]Yeah, I think there's probably a lot of accessibility features.
[16:30.44]Got to get games like this to be, because I mean, a driving game is hard.
[16:33.97]None of this would have been possible without the amazing teams.
[16:36.45]I like the accessibility features.
[16:37.93]Big thank you to our audio team for their tireless effort.
[16:40.61]Isn't accessibility in a driving game just like an automatic driving car?
[16:45.43]Thank you to the UI team, to our studio leadership team, and our accessibility leadership team.
[16:49.87]No, not necessarily.
[16:51.52]For being our accessibility consultant and partner for the last two years.
[16:57.36]We're really proud of the work that we've been able to do.
[16:59.48]So thank you very much.
[17:01.36]This looks so much better.
[17:06.75]I'm actually I'm watching this on a 4K TV.
[17:08.35]This is cool.
[17:08.95]Wow.
[17:09.09]This looks great.
[17:18.93]believe that by making their games and their company accessible and inclusive, they can develop new types of gameplay with stories that everyone can enjoy.
[17:28.13]They created the following game in a deep collaboration with artists and developers from the deaf community.
[17:34.13]And we are very excited to reveal it now.
[17:37.09]This is Harmonium the Musical.
[17:37.91]My webcam does not like to come through here for some reason.
[17:41.41]New webcam I have.
[17:42.85]Every new webcam I get just doesn't work.
[17:45.47]It's like a joke.
[17:47.31]You know what?
[17:47.73]I think that, uh, I think they do work that you just don't want people to look at you.
[17:53.70]Actually kind of cool.
[17:54.62]Yeah.
[17:55.04]I'm all cool with this.
[18:11.09]Okay, what would cause a webcam to just freeze after one second being activated through OBS?
[18:16.92]What do you think?
[18:19.42]If it's also open in the webcam software and they're counteracting each other.
[18:25.42]They're not, unfortunately.
[18:30.60]Well, that was my guess.
[18:33.74]If you could give me remote access.
[18:35.96]I can feel the sound.
[18:44.24]Okay, is it working?
[18:45.54]Okay, alright.
[18:48.94]I'm here.
[18:49.60]Alright, how long is it?
[18:57.07]How long is it before it happens?
[19:01.87]God damn it.
[19:09.66]Whatever.
[19:13.59]I missed that entire trailer.
[19:16.36]Coming to Netflix?
[19:19.42]I don't know how much better gaming can get.
[19:21.54]What happens past a golden age?
[19:23.24]Platinum?
[19:23.82]Is this the platinum age of gaming?
[19:25.70]Also, can I please be paid... Nah, nah, that was 2007.

[20:46.63]Valorant!
[20:48.13]Yeah!
[20:49.25]Valorant!
[20:51.83]Yes!
[20:52.07]On a technicality, you said Valorant, but that wasn't on the list.
[20:55.31]It was Valorant.
[20:57.19]What?
[20:58.32]On a technicality, you weren't quite right.
[20:59.98]What are you talking about?
[21:00.86]You said Valorant?
[21:01.90]That's two words.
[21:08.63]The name of that game is Valorant.
[21:10.29]It's Valorant.
[21:11.11]Am I putting like a southern accent on it for no reason?
[21:14.71]I don't know.
[21:15.17]Valorant.
[21:15.35]Maybe my USB isn't fast enough.
[21:37.57]Dude, this game... No way, dude!
[21:39.81]No way!
[21:40.93]No fucking way!
[21:43.42]They look like me.
[22:03.53]What's your game of the year?
[22:06.85]Um...
[22:11.09]This looks kind of good though.
[22:13.39]I don't know.
[22:13.77]I mean, I don't know.
[22:17.09]The only thing you're going to say about this trailer is I don't know.
[22:20.75]Give me some fucking commentary.
[22:23.93]I'm live on your stream and every take I have about a video game is wrong.
[22:27.89]So it's a lot of pressure to tell you the games I liked this year and which one was my favorite.
[22:34.23]I disagree.
[22:35.05]I think some of the ones you mentioned already are good ones.
[22:38.59]So do you have yours in your head?
[22:41.13]I do.
[22:42.11]Okay, so I'm going to say mine and you're going to distract.
[22:45.11]No, say your top three games of the year and I'll say mine.
[22:51.20]Top three.
[22:52.62]Yeah, why not?
[22:53.32]Top three.
[22:56.06]I don't know if I have two.
[22:57.56]Do they have to be like fully released?
[23:02.30]What did you play this year that you really, really liked?
[23:06.72]Game of the year goes to Q Remastered.
[23:10.34]Wow.
[23:10.68]And I guess Torchlight Infinite technically came out.
[23:16.94]And you think Torchlight Infinite is one of the best games of the year?
[23:22.60]Yeah.
[23:22.86]If we're going on releases of like actual it came out release.
[23:31.81]Distract.
[23:32.49]Can I get a distraction?
[23:34.59]No, no, that doesn't.
[23:35.73]I think you remastered is interesting to me.
[23:38.16]A lot of really good games came out this year that I feel like I don't even remember a lot of them and I didn't play a lot of them.
[23:42.51]Like I didn't play Baldur's Gate so I can't come out and say like the obvious.
[23:45.79]It was Baldur's Gate everyone.
[23:48.07]Yeah, I'm in that boat too.
[23:50.33]Baldur's Gate 3 was... I mean, I know it's so good and it's so amazing.
[23:55.40]There's so much to do, but it's just such a big game.
[23:58.36]I have not gotten to it yet.
[23:59.90]Holly and I played it for like, I want to say six to seven total hours, maybe.
[24:04.41]So we just barely started, maybe 10 hours total.
[24:08.03]I played 10 minutes.
[24:09.09]Maybe even less than that.
[24:15.15]Do you think we're going to get DLC news for Elden Ring?
[24:17.29]You can't just skip ahead and you didn't say your game.
[24:33.83]Oh, okay.
[24:34.47]Pizza Tower.
[24:35.37]Resident Evil 4 Remake.
[24:36.21]And... What's the third one?
[24:37.13]I feel like I was fighting with the third one.
[24:38.69]Resident Evil 4, they're Omega Lulling.
[24:40.81]I don't care.
[24:41.41]You can Omega Lull all you want.
[24:42.83]Did you finish Armored Core?
[24:43.67]I did not.
[24:43.97]Oof.
[25:01.52]I think I kind of need to say... It has to be a game that I've completed.
[25:06.76]It can't be like a Baldur's Gate scenario.
[25:09.52]I didn't complete Armored Core.
[25:11.92]Wasn't Zelda last year?
[25:15.19]Or am I like that far gone?
[25:20.57]No, Tears of the Kingdom was this year.
[25:22.23]That was like a few months ago.
[25:24.17]What, three, four months ago?
[25:26.57]No, so it wasn't.
[25:28.45]Was it longer than that?
[25:30.17]There's no way.
[25:30.73]Yeah, it was like four months ago.
[25:38.26]I need to see the nominees.
[25:42.24]I have a little bit of an issue with the Persona franchise.
[25:45.08]Can I tell you what it is?
[25:45.98]Uh, sure.
[25:49.01]Here's my only complaint with this franchise.
[25:51.25]I'm just going to give it to you.
[25:54.84]I feel like I would really like this game, but I don't know which one to start with because there's like Persona 5.
[26:01.02]Persona 5, let's go.
[26:02.36]Persona 5, Rock Out Edition.
[26:04.96]Persona 5, Walk Around the Town game.
[26:09.03]I don't, which one, what's the one, what do I play?
[26:11.99]What should I play?
[26:14.01]Persona 4 Arena.
[26:16.11]Persona 4 Arena is the one you think I should start with.
[26:20.01]Yeah, I think that cuts right into the story very quickly.
[26:25.72]Because I feel like the game, the gameplay to me looks really fun.
[26:28.80]The gameplay looks interesting to me.
[26:32.73]Don't start with five.
[26:34.53]Don't I remember you playing one?
[26:37.89]No, I think I'm not.
[26:39.71]I remember Persona 3 coming out.
[26:42.59]That was a very long time ago and I was like, oh, this game looks interesting.
[26:45.68]I guess I won't ever play it.
[26:47.88]I feel like I'm remembering a Persona 3 stream you did like 10 years ago.
[26:53.48]One time.
[26:53.94]No, no, I never played it on stream or on video or anything.
[27:01.36]okay what was that that was like okay like I don't believe that yeah see look at that okay p5 personal royale like what the fuck was that on the left was that the what game was that yes I was hoping for a new persona a new persona game that is I still want to be Sydney
[27:26.96]Wait, that was a new one?
[27:27.76]No, see, okay.
[27:29.80]See, I can't tell either.
[27:32.53]I thought they were just like doing a remaster or a hello version.
[27:35.55]It's fine.
[27:37.15]Summer version.
[27:37.89]One part three.
[27:41.52]I okay - on a similar note-
[27:43.52]It's a remake of three, okay.
[27:45.52]You know the the BlazBlue series I thought that there was only one game this whole time and I was playing - they have a roguelike now and my chat was telling me that all the BlazBlue are actually different games.
[27:56.52]What?
[27:57.52]And it blew my mind, like there's there's like 70 versions. There's centralification. There's all these weird names.
[28:04.00]And I thought because they use the same sprites and animations a lot of the time, so I thought they were all the same game.
[28:09.37]Hey, hold on a second. Shhh.
[28:11.19]Dave the diver.
[28:12.05]Hold on.
[28:13.13]I'm a fan of this one.
[28:14.83]I'm sorry you never heard of you never.
[28:16.28]Did you play Dave the Diver?
[28:21.84]I did not.
[28:24.16]I've heard good things.
[28:25.55]It's very fun.
[28:26.45]It's very fun if you like collecting and upgrading stuff, which I do.
[28:30.61]Did you play Dredge?
[28:31.50]I did not.
[28:32.08]I think you would really enjoy Dredge.
[28:34.72]I think so.
[28:35.24]I think you're a raw Dredger.
[28:36.96]Oh, this is Conjurer of the Year.
[28:51.15]I know one of these people.
[28:53.07]Who are these people?
[28:53.75]I know a couple.
[28:54.37]Oh, shit.
[28:54.59]Iron Mouse wins it.
[29:08.03]I am so incredibly honored to have been the recipient of the Content Creator of the Year award.
[29:14.15]First and foremost, I want to express my deepest heartfelt gratitude to the-
[29:18.15]If your webcam keeps not working, do you think you could do this... instead?
[29:23.73]Like right now? Have like a vtuber avatar-
[29:26.73]Well no I mean you could get one made like that.
[29:30.73]Oh you mean do- hey you know I had an idea a long time ago for something like this.
[29:34.73]If every webcam breaks-
[29:35.73]Shh, don't talk about it.
[29:47.71]No, I wanted to get frozen on something horrible.
[29:49.48]15 years in the making, sir.
[29:50.58]I remember this game.
[29:51.38]Salad Fingers?
[29:51.98]Oh.
[29:52.10]The...
[30:17.20]Can we make the bridges with the ink?
[30:25.33]Oh, the revolting blob.
[30:27.43]The revolting blob.
[30:28.59]No, that's not it.
[30:33.81]2D Boy.
[30:35.03]Galaxy of Goo?
[30:36.85]Yeah, no, no, it's something like that.
[30:41.26]Slime Rancher?
[30:42.86]No, this is like an old game from like...
[30:47.27]World of Goo for the Wii.
[30:48.61]Remember that was fucking awesome.
[30:54.99]Is Poly Bridge?
[31:01.41]In 15 years.
[31:02.09]Yeah, World of Goo is the original one.
[31:07.42]It was really fun.
[31:11.98]Essentially, yeah, you had to make physics-based bridges and stuff and contraptions to move, you know, to beat levels and stuff.
[31:20.11]It was really fun.
[31:39.29]Oh, it's World of Goo 2.
[31:41.45]Just a sequel.
[31:43.35]Where do the kids come in?
[31:45.29]Are they stuck in the goo or?
[31:46.57]I don't know.
[31:47.47]Wait, we haven't even started?
[31:48.29]I thought we were already going.
[31:50.55]Well, it doesn't, all the esports stuff like doesn't count.
[31:52.70]They do it as like a joke.
[31:54.26]So that wasn't real.
[31:55.14]That was a fever dream.
[31:56.52]There's already been so many reveals, man.
[32:09.46]It's a story about a world very different from ours.
[32:12.52]It is a world where all people are equal and no conflict exists.
[32:16.97]Wait, excuse me, no conflict?
[32:19.05]No, my games have to have constant conflict.
[32:23.61]I think it's about to happen.
[32:26.10]Are we getting Kingdom Hearts 4?
[32:27.92]Wait, no, that was... I was gonna joke, it's another Persona game.
[32:32.48]Is it?
[32:33.10]I can't keep track.
[32:33.92]It's like Kingdom Hearts 4?
[32:35.08]What the fuck am I talking about?
[32:37.06]Is it Persona 6?
[32:59.00]I don't think that's what this is.
[33:02.00]Well no, it said it was from the creators of Persona 4, 5 and 6... and 7.
[33:10.42]Hey, wait.
[33:10.84]Can you buy cures in this game?
[33:11.96]Can you buy, um, can you buy healing potions?
[33:15.72]No fucking way, dude.
[33:17.76]Is that where you draw the line?
[33:34.71]That's where I'm just like, you know what?
[33:36.73]Nah, not interested anymore.
[33:39.59]Wait, there's healing potions.
[33:41.91]Get out of here.
[33:43.39]It's 2023.
[33:43.53]Get better at games.
[33:44.65]I feel the same way whenever someone's like, oh, another pixel art game or like another anime.
[33:49.41]Oh, and potions.
[33:50.05]How original.
[33:50.41]Alright.
[33:50.63]Do you want to bet $100 that the Muppets show up at some point?
[34:03.85]No, you win that.
[34:05.03]Do I win?
[34:05.79]Are you sure, though?
[34:06.61]Because they've done that two or three years in a row.
[34:08.65]You think they'll do it again?
[34:11.24]I think the Muppets show up, yeah.
[34:13.72]You do?
[34:14.16]Okay.
[34:14.40]Yeah.
[34:14.88]You want to bet me on that?
[34:17.46]I would have won it right there.
[34:18.80]Well, that's what I was saying.
[34:20.24]I think they show up.
[34:21.28]I'm not taking that bet if you're on the Muppets show up.
[34:24.75]Oh, I wish you said yes.
[34:26.22]That would have been so fucking funny.
[34:28.76]If you had been like, no, no way, not again.
[34:30.50]And she just says Gonzo is going to shoot out of a cannon.
[34:33.46]Less obvious.
[34:34.26]I bet you $100 Baldur's Gate wins.
[34:37.85]Actually, you know what?
[34:39.61]Let's do a game of the year bet.
[34:43.37]because I don't know.
[34:45.93]It's 100% Baldur's Gate exclusively because it came out most recently and people remember it.
[34:51.50]Even if you want to have the arguments about The Elder Scrolls Zelda or whatever.
[34:58.18]Do you think he picks his entrance music?
[35:12.90]Is he like, no, no, no, not that one.
[35:14.70]That's the one.
[35:16.54]Give me the fucking electric guitar and shit.
[35:18.92]He's got her.
[35:20.32]Yeah, definitely.
[35:22.22]If you were running this show, wouldn't you pick yours?
[35:25.51]And boy, do we have a show for you.
[35:28.65]I am so excited to get this started.
[35:31.05]Together, we are going to recognize outstanding creative work in games in 2023.
[35:35.99]And we'll look into the future with an astonishing lineup of world premieres.
[35:42.13]More than anything, this is a show about bringing our community together in this room and online, around the world.
[35:48.94]Focus on something we can all agree on.
[35:51.58]There's nothing more powerful or more immersive than an extraordinary video game.
[35:57.35]I don't know, man.
[36:02.38]Great games comfort us, help us understand different perspectives on the world, and maybe even change us.
[36:09.39]That's what makes this medium different.
[36:11.75]Games, the actual things we play, are insanely special, and we're going to celebrate that for the next few hours.
[36:19.31]And we've got such an amazing group of people with us.
[36:21.91]They're built by talented creators and teams, and many of them are here tonight.
[36:26.77]I bet you $500 a Keanu Reeves Muppet shows up.
[36:30.39]Oh, I don't know.
[36:31.25]That's a hard one.
[36:34.76]That's like 5% odds you get a huge payout.
[36:38.18]One of our industry's greatest creative and technical forces, Mark Cerny, PlayStation's lead system architect celebrating 25 years of Cerny games.
[36:48.08]I don't like that eye contact.
[36:49.56]I got to be honest.
[36:51.23]Wait, what?
[36:51.69]I don't know.
[36:59.48]I think that looks pretty close to what I'm seeing on my screen.
[37:04.46]Capcom's been killing it.
[37:05.68]Conversation jump off point.
[37:28.12]oh yeah so let's get exo primal did great to present tonight's first award is last year's winner of dragons dogma 2 coming out please join me in welcoming back you would go oh that's right we're gonna do it the actor behind credo of war Christopher judge oh here it comes God of War

[38:01.08]Oh, what a card.
[38:04.48]Good evening, everybody.
[38:10.77]It is such a pleasure to be back here.
[38:14.81]I have such great memories of last year, Mr. Pacino, forgetting to thank my wife.
[38:27.78]I forgot about that.
[38:29.58]They're playing him off already.
[38:31.51]That's funny.
[38:33.43]Alright, alright.
[38:34.35]I get it.
[38:34.93]I get it.
[38:36.73]I'm not gonna stand up here making long speeches.
[38:40.19]I'm gonna stick to the script.
[38:42.35]It'd be great if he did a long one again.
[38:45.76]Just do it again.
[38:46.68]That would be like a Chad moment for sure.
[38:49.68]My speech was actually longer than this year's Call of Duty campaign.
[38:54.38]What?! !
[39:00.35]I don't get the reference.
[39:01.29]Who's played one of those?
[39:08.29]Another company I'll never win for.
[39:09.95]Chad moment, yeah.
[39:13.39]I'm here to present the award for best performance in a year of games.
[39:21.78]Beloved by audiences and acclaimed by critics.
[39:25.71]It better be the Pizza Tower scream.
[39:27.79]The guy that made that scream 40 years ago.
[39:33.03]And here are the nominees.
[39:35.45]Oh, yeah.
[39:36.04]Man Screaming 5 from Pizza Tower.
[39:40.96]it's been a long five years hope may feel beyond our grasp you play grown-up games you face grown-up consequences did you write these pages I heard this was really good I heard this was really good actually I didn't play a lot of stuff this year that's also why my game of the year take is so bad whoever wins
[40:11.32]I'll tell you, the Spider-Man.
[40:15.01]The Spider-Man lines, recording those lines are really hard to do.
[40:20.35]The straining ones, recording two different tracks that is straining and doing a line and saying it normally, I think is really cool.
[40:27.22]Yeah, it was great.
[40:29.66]See you all there.
[40:41.48]Four and a half minutes that he's been in my campaign.
[40:43.75]Actually, here's a little bit of a tidbit for those of you.
[40:47.59]In Holly and I's playthrough, I had a gnome mage or whatever the fuck.
[40:51.87]Full body armor.
[40:52.95]But it doesn't even matter what I made.
[40:54.03]I was playing a mage or whatever the fuck.
[40:57.37]This might be spoilers for the campaign, but I'm going to say that because spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3, if you haven't played it yet, here we go.
[41:03.80]But this is what happened.
[41:06.64]Spoilers incoming here.
[41:09.18]Don't spoil it.
[41:09.72]Okay, never mind.
[41:14.47]That's a cool story.
[41:15.88]That was a good one.
[41:18.18]Sorry.
[41:19.70]Okay, I won't spoil anything.
[41:22.05]I'll give it a shot.
[41:23.89]Thank you so very, very much for everybody that voted.
[41:26.89]My incredible fellow actors and the nominees, unbelievable talent.
[41:31.01]To be even considered amongst you is extraordinary, so thank you very much indeed.
[41:35.07]To Swen, to Larian, to all the writers, to Steven Rooney, the writer of Astarion.
[41:39.81]I'm going to forget everybody.
[41:41.29]To Pitstop, who worked so hard, the directors, my fellow actors, 248 incredible actors that gave it heart and soul.
[41:48.28]To mi familia, gracias.
[41:50.74]Para todos, gracias.
[41:53.23]Y Coco tambien.
[41:56.09]To my agents, I will thank you later.
[41:57.53]I'm sorry.
[41:58.05]I'm going to wrap it up apparently.
[41:59.25]It's unfortunate they had to take his katana when he came in.
[42:02.35]The community has reached out to so many of us at Larian and said they were seen and they were represented by this game when they lost hope.
[42:10.52]They felt isolated.
[42:11.60]They felt alone.
[42:12.72]And this game brought them together and gave them something to push through to help them all.
[42:17.40]And to you, I want to say thank you so much for seeing us.
[42:20.26]Appreciate it.
[42:20.86]This is going to clean up every category.
[42:22.94]That is for sure.
[42:24.14]I got 100%.
[42:24.50]Thank you.
[42:28.97]I'm looking forward to really playing it.
[42:31.09]And you know, here's the great thing.
[42:33.03]I have not played Baldur's Gate 3.
[42:35.19]I've not, I've played like a little bit, but that's, I got a great game to look forward to whenever the fuck I feel like playing it.
[42:41.24]That's awesome to know.
[42:42.18]There are lots more awards to come, but now it's time to look ahead to what you'll be playing next.
[42:48.29]Let's get to those world premieres.
[42:50.43]And for the honor of presenting our first one, it's an incredible thrill to introduce a true renaissance man.
[42:56.67]Please welcome Academy Award winning actor and New York Times bestselling author, Matthew McConaughey.
[43:06.16]How we doing?
[43:08.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:09.80]What is he announcing?
[43:13.13]Thank y'all for having me.
[43:16.65]Good to be here.
[43:17.31]What's up, everybody?
[43:18.41]Good to be here with you at the Game Awards.
[43:22.31]And I was going to come out and I was going to say the line that has preceded me all my career, alright, alright, alright.
[43:27.66]But they told me, they said, no, no, no.
[43:30.04]I'm going to bet you he was going to do that or not.
[43:31.92]That was a missed opportunity.
[43:34.46]If only you had time to pause.
[43:36.22]Yeah.
[43:36.36]Alright, we'll see how that handled.
[43:40.00]I'm here tonight because I have a world premiere for you from Austin's own Archetype Entertainment.
[43:47.88]I'm also here tonight because the video game that I'm premiering is the first ever video game that I'm a part of.
[43:55.32]Really?
[43:56.94]When the Archetype team first reached out to me, I was excited about becoming a part of the gaming world, but what really turned me on was when they shared the game's vision and my role in it.
[44:07.89]I will be voicing a character in this game, and all I can say is that I will have a unique relationship with every player in this game.
[44:18.63]I'm so interested.
[44:19.53]Oh, I can't fucking wait.
[44:20.65]Let me bring on the lead of this project, Peter Molyneux, everybody.
[44:23.13]Oh, shit.
[44:23.81]I believe it.
[44:53.07]Exodus?
[44:57.77]Okay.
[44:58.07]Max, we need to head back.
[44:59.25]Hold on, I'm getting a reading.
[45:04.79]Max!
[45:12.46]Wait!
[45:12.94]Max!
[45:13.04]What she found that day was a miracle.
[45:19.41]He got to the center of the cube.
[45:21.89]I'm sorry.
[45:24.61]Humanity's greatest enemy.
[45:26.19]This is it.
[45:33.80]They found us.
[45:34.42]Stop!
[45:34.56]Stay down!
[45:41.08]What if his character says it as well in the trailer?
[45:45.35]The Celestials hunted us down.
[45:49.16]What do you mean?
[45:50.28]What if his character shows up and is like, alright, alright, alright.
[45:55.08]And I had to save her.
[45:58.21]I led them away from this world, away from her.
[46:03.33]We both knew the cost of using the gates.
[46:07.89]When you travel at light speed, time slows to a crawl.
[46:12.86]It was only days for me, but an entire lifetime passed for her.
[46:21.95]And in the chaos of those final moments, we never said goodbye.
[46:25.55]No!
[46:25.97]Come with me!
[46:32.09]Wait!
[46:32.27]Please!
[46:32.81]Tom!
[46:34.33]I love you.
[46:39.71]Our service, our sacrifice, discovers worlds, seeds hope, breaks empires,
[46:52.56]We are the travelers.
[47:01.17]I mean, it looks visually.
[47:03.03]I mean, this looks really beautiful.
[47:06.81]It's really nice.
[47:08.83]I do have an opinion on whether or not the bloom on those neon lights are going to be fucking brighter than that.
[47:14.29]Because I bet they will be.
[47:17.56]But I hope they turn that down to like 2% brightness.
[47:24.40]That is a very exciting project.
[47:26.26]Giving me some Mass Effect vibes.
[47:27.70]And I appreciate the team sharing the first glimpse of gameplay at the end there.
[47:31.31]Looks great.
[47:31.89]Alright.
[47:32.17]Well, now we're going to go right on to another.
[47:35.01]Something feels so disrespectful of like you showing your game off and then right on stage immediately after he's like, looks like Mass Effect.
[47:42.68]Alright, next.
[47:47.90]This is captured on PS5, by the way.
[47:49.74]So you're wondering what console I think is the winner.
[48:02.86]Those fake crowd noises.
[48:03.84]Searching you remember nothing of this place.
[48:08.74]That sounded like nothing that would help canned audio.
[48:11.87]It did.
[48:12.33]It was kind of perfect.
[48:14.17]Alright, now be quiet.
[48:20.61]Why exactly are we doing this?
[48:25.22]I must face this.
[48:33.31]No shame in what just happened.
[48:34.96]It's all part of the process.
[48:36.62]Let's go again.
[48:37.88]I need to play this game, honestly.
[48:54.17]I like how every couple of scenes he's in like a Chuck E. Cheese armor.
[48:57.37]What a war.
[49:00.11]Ragnarok Valhalla.
[49:05.03]That's in a week, dude.
[49:08.86]Why are they not cheering that?
[49:10.88]They're cheering that.
[49:11.96]Oh, DLC.
[49:13.54]It's free?
[49:15.36]That's free DLC?
[49:20.35]That's actually pretty cool.
[49:22.64]There's a very nice holiday surprise from PlayStation.
[49:25.66]Kratos and the Mirror are headed to Valhalla in an adventure that blends God of War Ragnarok's combat with elements inspired by the roguelike genre for an emotional, unexpected, and fun new twist.
[49:37.55]And yes, as you saw, it is free.
[49:40.01]The team at Santa Monica Studio
[49:42.25]are fans of their fans and are offering this DLC, God of War Ragnarok Valhalla as a gift to the community and you will be able to download it in just five days on December 12th.
[49:54.45]The amount of PS5s that just went
[49:57.24]All booted up at the same time.
[50:00.54]All the powerful legion of PS5 players.
[50:04.96]A lot of us.
[50:05.98]I'm so proud of him for not leaking that.
[50:08.10]Oh no.
[50:26.06]Oh, that cheer was fake.
[50:30.38]It'd be kind of funny if they just... Somebody on a board just putting in fake screaming.
[50:39.07]This might be my favorite game ever made.
[50:40.53]This is what I think it is.
[50:41.35]Is this because you like this noise?
[50:45.98]Yeah.
[50:47.26]Honestly.
[50:48.66]Dopamine's going.
[50:50.02]No, I thought it was going to be like Goose Game, but you're like a chimpanzee or something.
[50:55.86]I'm thinking about, you know, if you were like a orangutan.
[50:59.02]Wait, this is intriguing though.
[51:01.80]Just walk around and look at stuff and that's perfect for me.
[51:24.43]This looks cute.
[51:25.19]What is this?
[51:26.31]There's little puzzles to do.
[51:29.29]You can paint.
[51:30.81]Big walk.
[51:31.53]I like it.
[51:32.11]I like it.
[51:52.29]Super fun, right?
[51:53.77]I did a play test of that game about a year ago and had so much fun.
[51:56.85]It is a very special and unique game, and I'm honored we got to share it with you here at the show.
[52:00.60]Alright, while you're watching TGA, head to tgasteamdeck.com right now.
[52:05.64]We're doing another Steam Deck giveaway.

[52:13.42]Enter now only during the live show at tgasteamdeck.com for a chance to win one of 100 OLEDs.

[52:32.95]Just wait.
[52:33.53]It's amazing.
[52:34.15]We'll be right back.
[52:35.41]I don't know.
[52:36.79]I mean, Rockstar has a lot of pressure with this game.
[52:40.20]Something that I think is important.
[52:42.34]I wish I could pause it because I really want to talk to you about this.
[52:45.78]Oh, well, I'm a YouTube player.
[52:46.90]You actually can pause it and pick up exactly where you left off.
[52:49.21]We want to watch this right now, but I'll give you a couple of quick things.
[52:54.61]Just real quick.
[52:58.18]I'm going to turn this down a little because this is important.
[53:00.36]Okay.
[53:00.71]FromSoftware just had their kind of... Their like pinnacle moment.
[53:06.27]Where... So Elden Ring comes out.
[53:07.91]And Elden Ring really, let's be honest, is a culmination I think of every... Really every FromSoftware game that got them to that point.
[53:14.95]To be a monster studio.
[53:16.28]And Elden Ring was this huge, crazy fucking experience.
[53:20.22]Probably one of the best games I've ever played.
[53:21.44]And...
[53:23.86]Rockstar right now, I think, is in their pinnacle of what they have released in their entire franchise, all the franchises, everything they've ever made.
[53:32.65]It all kind of leads up to right now.
[53:34.21]It's another pinnacle moment for a studio.
[53:36.51]Why?
[53:37.59]Why don't you feel like that's like GTA 4?
[53:40.76]Well, because when a GTA game comes out, it usually is the pinnacle of whatever generation we're currently in.
[53:48.02]So you're saying that basically every game they release is the pinnacle?
[53:52.79]Exactly.
[53:53.51]And I think what can be concerning people a lot, which, I mean, doesn't concern me, because obviously I think the game's going to be fun, but hitting that point where what else can they possibly do to make this another pinnacle fucking moment in video game history, and do they execute on that?
[54:10.46]That's why there's a lot of pressure on it right now.
[54:13.50]Because, like, Elden Ring is like, oh, here comes Elden Ring, by the way, everybody.
[54:17.60]You all loved Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3.
[54:21.81]We got Armored Core 2, but like, hey, by the way, Elden Ring is like the ultimate video game in this genre that you've ever played.
[54:29.14]I feel like GTA 6 is going to be that too.
[54:32.58]Maybe it's me, but I don't see the correlation to Elden Ring.
[54:36.30]Because GTA Rock, that's their pinnacle game.
[54:39.62]That's like the thing that everybody waits for.
[54:42.17]Every generation is a new GTA game.
[54:47.29]Fortnite's on now?
[54:49.88]I've got a friend.
[54:51.10]He likes lifting weights.
[54:52.32]He likes going to the gym.
[54:53.50]He's kind of a meathead.
[54:55.44]His friend told him to get Elden Ring.
[54:56.80]Elden Ring, best game.
[54:57.98]He couldn't beat the tutorial that you drop down into.
[55:03.21]I don't know if it's like the full complete comparison to the amount of people that are interested in GTA.
[55:08.13]No, but I'm talking about like the studio's work.
[55:11.73]Like the work of the actual studio.
[55:15.57]Elden Ring was the biggest thing that they had ever done.
[55:19.89]Okay, GTA six is it's turning into another.
[55:23.31]This is the biggest thing that's ever happened in video games.
[55:26.89]Rockstar has been and FromSoftware have been two of the reliable companies that give us generation worthy releases.
[55:38.43]You get it now, like generational.
[55:45.52]I have understood.
[55:47.32]I just think that
[55:49.37]And GTA 6, and if GTA 6 is not that, we might be in a new age of video gaming.
[55:56.12]Something else has to come and do it.
[55:57.38]If they cyberpunk it.
[55:59.30]That's what I mean.
[55:59.90]Like, if it's, if it's, if GTA 6 is not going to be a generational fucking video game, what if it's not?
[56:06.31]Right?
[56:07.13]And something else is going to have to be that and do that soon.
[56:12.65]Did you like that Lego game they just showed?
[56:14.17]Actually, it was kind of fun.
[56:16.65]Did you see it?
[56:21.09]You guys are just yapping?
[56:24.43]Yeah, I wanted to give it off my chest.
[56:25.83]I feel like it was an interesting fucking thing to think about.
[56:29.92]You're allowed to talk.
[56:31.20]This will be done and soon.
[56:35.99]It's like they're so dire.
[56:38.29]No, but I think it's like a pinnacle release.
[56:41.83]All the tech that exists now.
[56:44.63]It looks amazing.
[56:46.03]You do watch the trailer and you'll see just how densely packed that game really is.
[56:51.70]It seems like.
[56:52.58]This is really cool.
[56:53.40]I only saw that leaked tech demo and I haven't seen the new trailer.
[57:00.50]So I just haven't seen anything of it.
[57:03.86]It looks great.
[57:10.01]That is on fire.
[57:11.35]Actually on fire.
[57:29.50]Alright.
[57:30.42]Are you a let the marshmallow get completely covered and engulfed in flames kind of guy?
[57:34.60]Or are you a I'm going to meticulously, slowly... I'm the kind of guy who points out the fact that you told me to be quiet, listen to this, and then you couldn't stand the silence for 10 seconds.
[57:47.98]true that's fair I'll see you in like five minutes hey unless you want to talk about marshmallows oh let's listen to this it's an endless stalker of just quiet
[59:24.59]Okay.
[59:27.59]So are you a marshmallow?
[59:32.15]I haven't had a marshmallow in a long time.
[59:33.63]I think I would let it burn.
[59:37.21]Is that what we're saying?
[59:38.19]Do you hear it?
[59:46.04]The heartbeat of the last ones.
[59:50.92]What are your thoughts on peeps?
[59:53.72]I feel like you have to have a strong opinion on peeps.
[59:57.96]I do.
[59:58.46]I don't like the middle.
[60:00.10]I think they're cute decorations, but I don't know.
[60:08.63]Oh, this is the face game, isn't it?
[60:12.87]There are people with faces in it.
[60:14.73]No, no, but this is the face game.
[60:17.27]Yeah, they had the face trailer.
[60:20.71]Fades away.
[60:26.83]I feel this way like I did about when the first trailers for... What the hell is that detective game that Rockstar made?
[60:36.58]Why can I not think of it?
[60:39.04]L.A.
[60:39.66]Noire.
[60:41.76]I feel the same way about how I saw those spaces in L.A.
[60:44.02]Noire here.
[60:48.21]So it's just Space Game 2.
[60:51.68]I mean, that's not the only thing it has.
[60:53.51]It's obviously like a sequel to a really popular, really great game.
[60:56.17]But I mean, this is the face.
[60:59.92]It's the face game.
[61:48.62]Did you play the first one?
[61:51.34]No.
[61:54.60]I'm really interested in this one.
[61:55.74]Everything they're showing is really cool.
[61:57.50]Yeah.
[61:58.94]It looks good.
[61:59.92]The first one was.
[62:00.75]I never got into the first one.

[63:24.35]And the award goes to Alan Wake 2.
[63:29.67]Oh, damn.
[63:31.73]Alan Wake 2, not Baldur's Gate.
[63:35.22]Holy shit, it's Max Payne.
[63:43.36]I heard Alan Wake 2 is really exceptional.
[63:46.92]I don't really know much about it.
[63:48.82]I played the first one.
[63:49.62]That's all I really know about it.
[63:50.86]Thank you so much.
[63:54.30]Alan Wake, from the beginning, was a very story-focused project for us.
[64:01.71]I share this with the whole narrative team, the writers, Clay, Tyler, Sinikka,
[64:08.28]narrative designers who made the story into gameplay, Simone, Molly, the whole narrative team, directors working with actors, Anssi, Hanna, Rosie, Holly, all the wonderful actors.
[64:24.12]Here tonight, some of them, Melanie, Ilkka, Matt and David, but the whole cast, wonderful actors, and the song makers who made
[64:37.44]They're playing them off.
[64:39.78]They're getting them.
[64:58.93]We wanted to push things further to do something new and it's always a risk for you to embrace it and understand it means so much.
[65:09.57]I'll treasure this always.
[65:11.30]Do you think play play him off music should eventually turn into just death metal if they just kind of just did right at the end?
[65:19.12]I think he like coincidentally timed it at the right time.
[65:21.64]Otherwise they were going to start blasting him off.
[65:24.06]Honestly, to me, that gentle music is the yellow light, right?
[65:28.08]And the death metal is the red light.
[65:30.86]That's it.
[65:32.04]Yeah, if you're up there with the adrenaline of, I just won this, you don't hear that soft music.
[65:37.56]You don't hear it.
[65:39.26]And even if you do, your brain kind of goes, oh shit, okay, I gotta get this a little bit faster.
[65:43.59]But if all of a sudden it was just like... It'd be like, oh, I'm at the red light now.
[65:49.33]I'm at a red light.
[65:50.37]I'm stopping right here.
[65:53.63]Would you prefer that or a bouncer?
[65:55.13]You may have recognized that incredible creator who built her own independent studio in Tokyo and she wanted to show you what she's been working on before she even signed it with a publisher or a platform.
[66:05.78]I said, come to the show, just show it to the audience and the fans first.
[66:09.46]So that's what we're going to do.
[66:10.36]We're honored to have her back at the Game Awards.
[66:12.52]Please give a warm welcome to Akumi Nakamura.
[66:20.11]Stop using Ethernet.

[66:40.85]I'm super excited to be on this stage again.
[66:46.05]Thank you.
[66:47.37]First...
[66:51.35]I want to say thank you to the Anshin artist.

[67:23.34]It's time to see the unseen.
[67:27.74]Bye-bye!
[67:52.48]Are you watching this one?
[67:54.54]What?
[67:55.02]I'm watching the whole show.
[68:03.97]What do you think?
[68:05.99]I don't know what this is yet.
[68:09.79]I think they said but I may have missed it.
[68:12.61]I want gameplay.
[68:15.69]Okay.
[68:20.31]so many incredible projects tonight thank you akumi now tonight it's not lost on me that all of our game of the year nominees are from big established franchises and while we all love a big sequel it's important to use a place like tga to introduce you to brand new worlds like what you just saw with kamuri and like this project my sister
[68:53.72]What?
[68:54.12]Thank you for checking in with that.
[68:57.08]Oh, I am watching this one.
[68:58.40]Are you watching this one?
[68:59.87]Oh, I thought you left because I went...
[69:03.65]That is why I laughed.
[69:05.33]Oh.
[69:06.71]Well, I have to prove that I'm watching because I'm out on face cam.
[69:09.96]It was quiet for a while.
[69:11.42]I think the last thing you showed was yourself sleeping in a recliner.
[69:14.84]And then like a minute goes by and you go, Mm-Hmm.
[69:17.24]That's to prove that I'm still live streaming.
[69:19.70]Yeah.
[69:26.58]Is this like Darkest Dungeon or something?
[69:39.24]If you're allowed to, then I'm allowed to go.
[69:41.70]Okay, give me a break.
[69:44.42]That's not fair.
[69:45.54]I can't go, but you can go.
[69:47.40]I think your brain might be on 300 thing.
[70:04.16]Uh, it's probably like 200, but that's accurate, I would say.
[70:08.34]A little better than that.
[70:14.28]I am watching this one.
[70:15.81]This is looking good.
[70:18.37]And our prayers came back Like a voice in the dark Unanswered, but not quite the same
[70:34.14]Go rest for the wicked, OK?
[70:40.08]March 1st.
[70:41.84]That's soon medicine.
[70:44.98]That's no rest for the Wicked in action RPG from Moon Studios, and more information is coming March 1st, as you saw with the Wicked Inside Showcase.
[70:52.57]Tonight during the Game Awards, viewers in the US can enter to win one of 100 Lenovo Legion Go gaming handhelds, a Windows 11 gaming PC in your hand.
[71:00.75]Yeah, I think that's just more info.
[71:01.97]That's not released yet.
[71:04.21]To enter for your chance to win.
[71:06.72]Here's a look at the Legion Go in action.
[71:17.11]I was gonna say there better be people having fun at a party.
[71:20.19]How many marshmallows can you eat before you're worried about your health?
[71:24.30]In a row, in one sitting, or in a week?
[71:26.52]Like in a sitting.
[71:27.82]How many is it like this might hurt?
[71:29.06]I would say if you get to more than seven, I think it's about time to reevaluate.
[71:40.64]I'm at like five so much more to discover you're good they worry me no I'm not at five I'm saying if I ate five I've had some incidents um I think you'd be good you think I could handle it
[72:00.60]Well, I'm judging it by if you make a s'more, it's usually what?
[72:03.58]One to two marshmallows.
[72:05.15]I could eat two s'mores, maybe three if I'm having a great time.
[72:09.25]So that's two, four, six-ish over the course of like a couple hours.
[72:13.44]I don't know.
[72:15.06]Do you play Starfield?
[72:17.38]Yeah, I fell asleep in the first 40 minutes.
[72:19.98]And I actually mean that.
[72:21.24]And I'm not trying to be like, oh, I fell asleep because the game's not good.
[72:24.39]I genuinely fell asleep.
[72:26.85]And then I accidentally attacked somebody in one of the first towns and my save file was there with just people running around like screaming at me because I attacked somebody and I fucked up my whole playthrough.
[72:39.98]That's another one of those games that I really would love to play, but it's just, it's a, you got to sit down.
[72:44.50]And I'm playing Starfield today.
[72:47.14]That's what I'm doing.
[72:49.85]I haven't gotten there.
[72:50.55]Avatar game.
[72:51.67]What they do to the land, the RDA, that is death.
[73:09.47]This apparently is really good, somebody said.
[73:11.17]We did not want war.
[73:14.26]But they have made us warriors.
[73:18.04]Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora, available now.
[73:21.28]I kind of want to... Ooh, I can play that.
[73:24.88]PlayStation.
[73:26.71]Hold up, hold up, hold up.
[73:29.43]This is his.
[73:31.95]Good day, Sot.
[73:33.41]Shit, I forgot to... We forgot to see if there was going to be a fake video game.
[73:37.49]I am a baron.
[73:40.23]Because you've got to bet that.
[73:41.75]You could set up the bingo card and get it.
[73:45.96]For next year.
[73:47.58]You put Muppets in there.
[73:50.22]Wait, is it going to be Muppets?
[73:56.14]Well, you put Muppets on the bingo board.
[73:58.65]We have been saying it all night, but it really has been an outstanding year for gaming.
[74:03.67]Now to talk about some of the biggest games.
[74:06.20]It's a pleasure to welcome from the Muppets.
[74:08.84]That's right.
[74:09.46]The great Gonzo.
[74:10.82]Now I wake up.
[74:13.66]Thank you.
[74:14.24]Hey, Jeff.
[74:14.94]It's great to be here.
[74:16.56]Hey, buddy.
[74:17.98]Thanks for coming.
[74:19.80]Looks like you're kind of wearing what I'm wearing.
[74:22.74]Yeah.
[74:23.28]It's like looking in a mirror, isn't it?
[74:28.69]He never missed.
[74:29.45]Well, I really don't think... So, Gonzo, what have you been playing?
[74:35.85]Seriously, what have you been playing?
[74:37.47]Hey, everybody.
[74:40.91]Gonzo's buying everyone popcorn tonight.
[74:42.95]Hey, wait a minute.
[74:44.79]They should have shot him out of a cannon.
[74:45.81]You know what I mean?
[74:47.03]They should have shot him out of a cannon over the fucking titantron back there.
[74:50.11]Thank you.
[74:50.63]Seriously, though, what have you been playing, Gonzo?
[74:54.01]Well, lots and lots of Tears of the Kingdom.
[74:58.14]He does a full speedrun starting right now.
[74:59.58]That would be amazing.
[75:00.24]I have a very important question about this.
[75:01.44]You're gonna interrupt Gonzo, dude?
[75:02.52]No.
[75:02.64]Yeah, after this.
[75:25.92]You kidding?
[75:26.76]Actually, if you have the time.
[75:28.50]Hey, you guys got a minute?
[75:31.04]I'd like to show you how many of this year's greatest games all revolve around one central theme.
[75:36.44]Check this out.
[75:41.09]Got the case for it?
[75:42.09]Yeah, that's quite a conspiracy you've uncovered.
[75:44.75]I know, I know.
[75:46.03]You probably think I'm obsessed with chickens and I can't appreciate video games beyond this one very specific interest.
[75:53.18]I mean, yeah, I think we're all thinking that.
[75:56.93]Yeah, maybe.
[75:58.35]What do you think, Zelda?
[76:00.35]People are fluff doing.
[76:01.47]He never misses.
[76:02.61]Yes!

[76:41.68]Oh, shit.
[76:42.18]This is a hard one, but I'm going to have to give it to Pizza Tower because it's only nominated.
[76:45.82]It's not nominated anywhere else.
[76:47.80]If the Pizza Tower wins, it's a whole full circle thing apparently you don't know about.
[76:51.46]Is it?
[76:51.58]Yeah.
[76:51.70]Well, that's not Pizza Tower.

[77:28.37]The team from Geometric couldn't make it out tonight, but they wanted us to pass along their thanks for everyone who played and voted for Cocoon.
[77:37.02]And to Yepi, Mads, and Jakob, and everyone at the team at Geometric, thank you so much for being such a wonderful partner on this game.
[77:45.12]Thank you.
[77:45.88]A debut is because they've made a new studio.
[77:53.49]originally on the indie list was Dave the diver but there's a quote from the CEO of that company saying we know Dave the diver looks indie but it absolutely is not so people were like why is Dave the diver on the indie list when even the people making it say it's not actually indie and then they put Pizza Tower on and I was like wait a second Pizza Tower wasn't on it to start excited to see go mobile in 2024. Google play will

[79:03.91]Really?
[79:04.17]Of course I did.
[79:22.21]Oh, shit.

[80:01.56]I don't think my computer's fast enough for this webcam.
[80:04.01]What is this, Scream?
[80:05.49]Oh, yeah.
[80:06.33]Now, typically a world premiere reveals one game, but leave it to SEGA to announce five new games in one trailer.
[80:13.05]So many memories for all of us.
[80:14.61]All those are first of the many brand new games in development and set for release over the next several years.
[80:20.45]Thanks to SEGA for that truly incredible announcement.
[80:24.03]Alright, well, this next trailer might be something Dragon Ball fans have been waiting to hear about for a while.
[80:29.65]Here we go.
[80:33.99]Remember, you need a haircut?
[80:34.77]Yeah, I know.
[80:35.23]I'm just waiting until I can't take it anymore.
[80:40.37]A masterful retelling of the Cell Saga again.
[80:52.06]As long as my favorite character is Mr. Satan, I don't care.
[80:58.78]Mr. Satan walks around, talks to people and all that stuff.
[81:05.13]Oh, you just said it.
[81:05.93]It is.
[81:09.35]Well, that's Frieza.
[81:10.21]Wait, that is the Cell Saga, isn't it?
[81:11.99]It's always Frieza to Cell and then it's over.
[81:14.46]Please show him.
[81:22.54]Wow.
[81:22.76]See who's there.
[81:32.00]Okay.
[81:38.18]Sparkling Zero, I thought it was a beverage.
[81:45.16]Super Master's present.
[81:49.14]An auction RPG.
[81:50.61]From the world of Dead by Daylight.
[82:00.27]Dead by Daylight has a world?
[82:04.87]I guess so.
[82:07.18]Telling myself I won't go there.
[82:11.10]Oh, but I know that I won't care.
[82:13.78]Trying to wash away all the blood I spilled.
[82:21.64]This loss is a burden that we both share.
[82:25.33]Two sinners can atone from a long prayer.
[82:28.97]Souls tied intertwined by pride and guilt.
[82:37.51]It's darkness in the distance From the way that I've been living But I know I can't resist it
[82:54.04]I'm kind of curious what this is.
[83:18.32]Where's Nick Cage?
[83:18.98]I just can't wait until they put in The Nun into Dead by Daylight if they ever do.
[83:23.07]And make sure you check out The Nun 2.
[83:54.94]I'm going to go take Otto outside.
[83:56.27]I'll be right back.
[83:57.31]I'm going to take Otto out.
[83:59.13]I'll be right back.
[83:59.85]Otto.
[84:00.51]I will be right back.
[84:03.32]I'm not here.
[84:04.08]He saw anime.
[84:05.10]He left.
[85:13.70]It is said that time marches to the beat of a drum.
[85:19.24]A fleeting moment can feel like a lifetime for those caught in its deadly rhythm.
[85:25.72]And a lifetime can pass in the blink of an eye for anyone embracing its bitter end.
[85:37.07]The only thing we know for sure is that time marches forward.
[85:44.83]Even if we are apart still we are one without hesitation Without remorse If the drum drives the rhythm Yeah
[86:15.23]But if you're going to want to rewind to alter the Keanu Reeves came out that said Silk Song is real.
[86:25.12]Oh, OK.
[86:25.44]So here's the I'm the bug.

[88:46.61]But right now, we'd like you to meet one of tonight's nominees for Best Debut Indie Game, who is also part of the newly inducted future class presented by Old Spice.
[88:58.82]My name is Abhi.
[88:59.80]In India when I grew up, I had a very early interest in games.
[89:05.30]When I got to Canada at the age of 12, it was a whole new world for me.
[89:08.56]For many South Asian families, food is not just a thing to cook, but also a way of expressing affection and all the things that they can say.
[89:16.59]This year was a blur.
[89:17.21]Like I said, I don't even remember that Zelda came out this year.
[89:19.97]I thought it was a year ago.
[89:20.81]It's a story of an Indian mother who moves to Canada in the late 1980s.
[89:24.87]It's a story about love, loss, and family.
[89:28.78]You didn't.
[89:31.04]You only played seven games?
[89:33.62]That sounds about right.
[89:35.64]Is that real?
[89:36.48]Did I play seven games?
[89:37.74]I only streamed like seven times this year.
[89:40.24]That's what it feels like.
[89:47.67]Party Animals came out this year.
[89:53.59]Well, let me take this opportunity to say what I wanted to say in the beginning.
[89:57.55]Yep.
[89:59.30]I'm gonna mute you and this because this is more an ad right now.
[90:03.73]Ster is no longer here.
[90:05.69]Grotto Beasts Tabletop Simulator is out right now.
[90:09.11]The mod for Tabletop Simulator.
[90:10.79]The unofficial mod for Tabletop... Wait, he's still here.
[90:13.94]Actually, you can hear him.
[90:17.40]It's fine.
[90:18.00]Yeah, it's okay.
[90:20.50]Yeah, Tabletop Simulator.
[90:21.70]It is there.
[90:23.34]It's on the workshop right now.
[90:24.66]It is available...
[90:28.46]It is free.
[90:29.70]It's a free download on the workshop.
[90:31.81]You do have to have Tabletop Simulator.
[90:34.29]Go check it out.
[90:35.05]A lot of time, a lot of work went into it.
[90:37.13]It's awesome.
[90:40.01]Oh, you can hear this in the background still.
[90:43.66]Oh, whatever.
[90:44.60]Screaming.
[90:48.12]Okay.
[90:50.16]Regardless of any of this, the store is also on sale.
[90:55.18]yeah all the the cards are on sale between 15 and I believe 18 off through the end of the year we did talk about some people were getting a shipping I'm gonna turn this down I'm gonna turn this off okay uh there was
[91:18.59]Okay, there are ship... I gotta turn it off for me.
[91:21.37]There were shipping estimates that said that it was happening in late January.
[91:24.43]Those are not accurate.
[91:26.17]So if you saw, if you go, my shipping says like late January.
[91:30.11]If you ordered last week, you should get it before Christmas.
[91:33.83]If you ordered after that, you'll see it probably, it's going to be hard to get it to you by Christmas.
[91:38.89]But it's not going to be that late January estimate.
[91:42.76]That's what we've been told.
[91:43.80]So that's what I'm relaying to you all.
[91:48.69]And they have perfect timing.
[91:52.49]Yeah, well done.
[91:53.33]Proud of Beasts is on sale.
[91:55.17]Coming down at the end of the year.
[91:57.15]What is this?
[92:18.89]kojima he was about to cry so I think it's kojima like you could tell in his voice he's he loves him so much the jabbering crab
[92:46.33]and the mad whale and started fending and cracking purchasing fonts purple dinosaurs ate a kind singing fox to jubbering crap and the mad whale and started wending and cracking
[93:29.89]there's a close-up of a streamer's face game when they're playing a theory face game three check out the new content creator as she plays through this terrifying experience that is a face game that actually might be a more potentially impressive face game coming up
[93:55.57]He gives him these, the Kojima reveal.
[94:00.44]Oh yeah, we talk about who gets to choose their own intro music.
[94:04.14]Please welcome the visionary game developer behind OD, Mr. and Dale Gojima!
[94:11.37]What, what, you don't think they asked everybody if they wanted to come through a magical fucking PT door with their entrance?
[94:20.83]I don't think so.
[94:23.02]That's so fucking funny.
[94:25.02]Well, this is exciting.
[94:26.04]Welcome back to the Game Awards.
[94:29.04]Thank you, Jeff.
[94:30.83]I'm very happy to announce the new game, OD, at the TGA, which will be our 10th anniversary.
[94:38.51]Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udokia will play in this game.
[94:50.63]I'm really glad to be at the 10th G, uh, Game Awards.
[94:55.01]Really happy to show the new title, OD, and this title will feature, uh, main roles Sophia Lillis, uh, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier.
[95:04.15]Uh, I think we all want to know more, of course.
[95:07.05]What kind of game are you making, Mr. Kojima?
[95:09.49]I love trying new things that no one has ever done before.
[95:14.67]With the help of Xbox Game Studio, we are making a brand new unique and sharp game using their cloud technology.
[95:31.70]It's hard to explain in words because it's something that hasn't been done before, but of course it's a game.
[95:38.45]It's a game you can play and enjoy, but it's also a kind of movie, and it may be a new media.
[95:50.14]So I really like to always challenge new things, groundbreaking things, and that's my kind of rule.
[95:56.81]But this one, with help of Xbox Game Studios and using their cloud gaming technology, I'm kind of doing this together.
[96:07.96]But it's really to make immersive.
[96:11.24]and also something that never no one has seen before is what I'm trying to do and it is a game don't get me wrong but it's at the same time a movie but at the same time a new form of media like a like an FMV well we can't wait to learn more about what you're working on that's actually really interesting if that's what it is is there somebody else at the door it's bill clinton it's gonna be a muppet is it a muppet is it gonzo
[96:38.49]Everyone, please welcome Jordan Peele to the Kojimaverse.
[96:43.27]Oh, yeah.
[96:46.63]The Kojimaverse.
[96:59.36]And Gonzo's in it.
[97:00.26]How's it going?
[97:02.39]Oh, my God.
[97:03.17]Jordan, welcome to the Game Awards.
[97:05.23]What a fun surprise.
[97:06.97]I know you're a big fan of Hideo's games, right?
[97:09.29]I'm a huge fan of Hideo.
[97:10.39]This man is an icon.
[97:12.37]And I can say from the first moment I played Metal Gear Solid 2, I knew I was experiencing the work of an artist
[97:26.37]whose craft just hits different.
[97:30.45]How much does he pay them?
[97:31.89]And he's been an inspiration to me.
[97:33.93]And the opportunity to collaborate with him is truly incredible.
[97:38.11]In my films, I'm always trying to maximize the immersion.
[97:43.87]Put the audience into the main character's shoes.
[97:49.01]Hideo is the master of this.
[97:52.35]And he does it on a whole
[97:54.55]Nubba level.
[97:57.68]And what he's cooking up here is completely immersive, utterly terrifying, and I am absolutely honored to be collaborating with the GOAT.
[98:05.58]Let's go!
[98:08.51]Oh, it's definitely not going to be an FMV, but if it's Kojima making a new type of game that's like an FMV?
[98:12.15]Well, Jordan is one of the few creators that are considered geniuses, and I was a big fan of his.
[98:26.80]I've known him since we first met, and we've known each other for a long time.
[98:31.38]I grew up watching movies and making games.
[98:33.09]Jordan grew up playing games and making movies, so I thought it would be very interesting for the two of us to collaborate, so I started making games with Jordan.
[98:48.48]Well, Jordan is one of those genius, and I've been a big fan of him.
[98:52.50]And when I met him, I felt like we were friends from the past.
[98:55.52]We get on very well.
[98:56.52]We like things that we both like, and we're really happy, and we wanted to collaborate something.
[99:01.26]And this time, well, Jordan, I grew up watching movies, and I'm a game creator now.
[99:08.35]Also,
[99:25.61]This project is not only for Jordan, but also for many other creative supporters and other people.
[99:32.24]We are planning to focus on each of their fears and do storytelling.
[99:35.30]I can't introduce the members here, but they are very gorgeous women, or rather, they are the gathering of giants.
[99:41.38]I call them the Avengers.
[99:56.90]So what I could say right now is that it's not just Jordan.
[100:02.98]I have other creative collaborative partners with me on board on this project.
[100:09.12]I can't really say who they are right now, but I tell you they are the legends and they're going to be amazing.
[100:15.97]And I actually call them the Avengers.
[100:21.63]Well, the door is closed for now, so no more special guests, but it's going to be amazing.
[100:25.56]I just want to stress that what this band is building here is unlike any other game.
[100:31.19]It is going to be crazy.
[100:33.25]That's it.
[100:34.53]We cannot wait to learn more.
[100:36.51]Hideo Kojima, Jordan Peele.
[100:38.73]Thank you so much, guys.
[100:40.59]I know that they do that.
[100:41.63]It's like a reveal for a collaboration.
[100:44.59]That's a collaboration that I think is a great one.
[100:47.59]Let's hope it actually comes to fruition.
[100:50.29]See if they can make what they want to make.
[100:51.83]I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.
[100:56.33]Really spectacular.
[100:57.17]Spared no expense.
[100:59.60]For this place, I wanted to show them something that wasn't an illusion.
[101:05.42]You're a big Jurassic Park fan.
[101:06.79]Yeah, didn't you go see the last movie like five times?
[101:10.97]Uh, I saw every single showing in several states.
[101:15.18]Now, is that because the movie theaters are better or cleaner in different ways?
[101:23.34]What does that mean?
[101:25.00]Different candy selection?
[101:26.06]It's like, you know, when a band goes on tour and they do concerts, I did like the Jurassic Park tour of all the openings.
[101:34.25]Oh, that's cool.
[101:34.99]I'm such... This is like the scene from the first one.
[101:39.03]this is yes it is I think that's incredible the homage why would you throw the flashlight that's the only source of light you have that was a big ass flashlight too that was a spotlight for a theater production that thing was gigantic anything with that rafters hate that
[102:09.93]That was a like 40 ounce Gatorade.
[102:12.93]How big that fucking thing was.
[102:14.35]You could have kept that.
[102:15.27]This is a lot like the other scene you may remember, but only if this dinosaur goes.
[102:41.09]Thank God.
[102:53.36]I'm actually interested in this.
[102:55.02]I want to play this.
[102:58.88]Alien isolation, but with Jurassic Park dinosaurs.
[103:01.46]That sounds kind of awesome if that's what that is.
[103:04.51]Please welcome Grammy award winning producer, Zeb.
[103:16.33]Hello, everybody.
[103:16.95]I'm honored to be here tonight to present the award for Best Audio Design.
[103:22.29]Sound is an often overlooked but crucial aspect of game development.
[103:26.67]It's what brings games to life, creating the immersive worlds we love to explore.
[103:31.67]It's the eerie noises deep in the forest, the echoes inside an abandoned spacecraft, or the satisfying sound of shooting a web.
[103:40.92]This year, we've seen some incredible examples of audio design in games as talented sound designers have pushed the boundaries of what's possible.
[103:49.12]Here are the nominees.
[103:51.02]Sound design, this is not necessarily, is it music necessarily or is that a different category?
[103:54.96]I think it was all sound design.
[104:01.33]Oh yeah, Dead Space Remastered came out this year.
[104:05.73]This was great.
[104:06.85]This was really fun.
[104:16.44]I love that game and the game award goes to hi-fi rush oh there you go yeah that was good someone said I can't believe you just turned the volume down for best the only one you turned down was best sound design they turned it up way too loud they turned it up this is the lowest I've dropped my volume
[104:50.45]Thank you so much.
[104:56.30]As part of this game, they play them off with music, but Kojima gets to come up here for 20 minutes.
[105:08.70]Dude, that was like a game collab announcement.
[105:12.58]They're like the greatest of this category being celebrated.
[105:15.68]It's like their night.
[105:16.42]Thank you for this amazing award.
[105:18.24]It's so glad that the work that the team has done together to achieve has been recognized here.
[105:22.87]Thank you to everyone who supported this project.
[105:24.89]And from myself, thank you to our family, friends, partners, pets.
[105:29.47]Thank you everyone at Bethesda, ZeniMax, Microsoft, and all the players out there for going with this ridiculous project.
[105:38.15]And most of all, to the team at Tango for taking such a wild idea and making it a reality.
[105:43.54]Thank you so much.
[105:51.31]Did Pizza Tower get any other nominations?
[105:53.27]Is there a music category?
[105:54.63]Alright, let's turn to the world of Fortnite.
[105:56.63]If you haven't already, check out the Game Awards Island in Fortnite.
[106:00.27]It's been updated with new trophies tonight to collect.
[106:03.05]Fortnite is expanding into a full-on platform with tons of new experiences beyond Battle Royale.
[106:07.91]Earlier today, LEGO Fortnite launched, and on Saturday, the music game Fortnite Festival.
[106:12.67]Tomorrow, though, the team at Psyonix behind Rocket League delivers Rocket Racing.
[106:18.12]Here's your first look.
[106:38.53]What's that guy's name?
[106:39.97]That's like the Minecraft Steve of Fortnite.
[106:41.83]What's his name?
[106:51.96]Jonesy?
[106:53.28]Jonesy?
[106:53.80]Is that right?
[106:59.85]okay so do you think that jonesy will have his own animated 3d movie first or do you think they'll do a Minecraft movie first that's a tough one oh man that's that's rough I think Minecraft
[107:21.71]Doug, Doug, what's up?
[107:23.45]Thanks for the raid, Doug, Doug.
[107:25.23]Welcome, everybody.
[107:25.77]We're doing Game Awards, Sir and I. Thanks, welcome.
[107:32.26]They're Minecraft movies already.
[107:35.72]Wait, you think there's a Minecraft movie already, like in the works?
[107:38.08]No, I think they're working on one.
[107:41.08]Will it come out?
[107:43.48]Or the Jonesy one?
[107:44.62]I don't know what I'm saying anymore.
[107:48.10]That's fine.
[107:49.50]That's fine.
[107:52.24]It's already a thing.
[107:53.50]Hmm?
[108:14.80]Master, are there more good folks in the world or bad?
[108:19.47]More good?
[108:21.01]Of course.
[108:22.07]Then why is there always suffering?
[108:25.23]And why do the bad folks always win?
[108:27.87]Because goodness without teeth punishes not.
[108:33.70]It only foments evil.
[108:37.40]Lends the world with blood and grow in it.
[108:42.36]That is your destiny.
[108:49.70]Oh, whoa, it is.
[108:50.98]It's the keeper of the new West.
[108:54.40]Welcome the destined one.
[108:57.26]The destined one who doesn't even know what he's destined for.
[109:02.38]Those old rascals, they surely know how to name.
[109:07.51]Is my kind destined for extermination?
[109:10.75]You're driven by glory, not destiny.
[109:14.77]So this is the face of the destined one.
[109:17.03]It will fit me just as well.
[109:20.13]Bathe in blood, yet preaching peace.
[109:23.23]Oh, you immortals, pray enlighten me.
[109:26.47]What justifies your superiority?
[109:34.62]Oh god.
[109:36.20]Okay, this is hard.
[109:48.93]Constant conflict, that's right.
[109:51.13]That's how you know you got a winner.
[109:53.93]There's no scenes of, of, of, of them eating, of them resting.
[109:58.99]No, it's just sword, attack, fight, survive, kill.
[110:05.55]Oh, sweet destiny.
[110:09.69]Constant conflict.
[110:17.61]That's not that far away.
[110:18.41]That looked good.
[110:22.08]I thought that looked fun.
[110:23.02]It looked interesting.
[110:23.74]Yeah.
[110:24.94]Wait, I was looking.
[110:25.82]Who was the dev?
[110:26.34]Did you catch it?
[110:26.80]Uh, science.
[110:27.24]Game science.
[110:39.76]This is the game that everyone was waiting for, right?
[110:45.57]This is the Rocksteady game.
[110:46.65]Wait, what?
[110:47.31]Is this a Rocksteady game?
[110:49.35]Is this the game that everyone was waiting for a long time ago?
[110:51.81]Yeah, it's just a Rocksteady.
[110:53.19]This is the one where you gotta kill... I was reading chat.
[110:57.17]Okay.
[110:57.63]You gotta kill the guy.
[110:58.90]Gotta kill Superman.
[111:17.26]dude they just introduced gorillas to the DC verse and it's a remix of that song which means a licensing deal right so what's the plan time for us bad guys to save the world
[111:48.87]Superman kills all of them instantly.
[111:51.11]I don't get it.
[111:52.05]Doesn't he?
[111:53.33]Superman kills every single person standing there in a half a second instantly.
[111:56.48]Joining me now are Rebecca and Megan from Digital Extremes up in Canada to talk about all things Warframe.
[112:02.32]We've got a special Warframe Twitch drop tonight for those of you watching on Twitch.
[112:05.98]But I understand you've also got some other news for Warframe fans on the next expansion, right?
[112:10.12]Yeah, we do.
[112:10.54]You know, it's been 10 years for Warframe.
[112:12.20]So, you know, 10 years for you.
[112:13.48]We assumed we'd get a senior's discount of some time just because our game is probably the oldest game here, maybe.
[112:17.69]But yeah, we have going strong.
[112:19.41]I know it's because our community is so awesome.
[112:21.51]And we are going to be showing you the release date for our next major update for Warframe.
[112:23.51]You're a Warframe fan, right?
[112:25.53]So we do have a trailer for, you know, Warframe players around the world to watch, which is quite exciting.
[112:30.27]I'll be a fan when there's something to do. It's been a while.
[112:41.27]I'm willing to be convinced.
[112:45.27]Let's see it.
[112:50.27]They were working on a whole new game. I'm pretty excited about whatever they do next.
[113:00.85]You have changed everything.
[113:06.11]The lidless eye has seen you.
[113:10.08]The Tenno.
[113:10.92]Do you think we're gonna get SCORN DLC?
[113:52.03]If only Warframe was as fun as this trailer makes it look.
[114:00.79]I kind of love Warframe being pretty fun.
[114:09.80]I played it with you, Ster, for like a week or so, didn't I?
[114:14.34]uh it sounds familiar is this still warframe by the way hold on that transition was sudden I think they have a fantastic amazing base of a game and then for the last couple years have developed it into totally random directions
[114:37.26]I've been around for a long time, though.
[114:38.98]I feel like it's going to have that problem.
[114:40.44]Look at, like, WoW.
[114:40.97]WoW is on, what, Expansion 10 or something?
[114:43.27]What is this?
[114:59.32]I was waiting for it.
[115:00.18]I was waiting for that sound.
[115:01.98]I was like, it's coming.
[115:03.24]When is it?
[115:03.60]You could go to Super Mario World.
[115:06.16]Oh, fuck.
[115:06.50]I got the name wrong.
[115:11.73]How?
[115:12.03]I'm not getting the job.
[115:13.09]Mmm.
[115:28.71]Oh, Todd, tell me something whimsical than half true.
[115:34.52]Okay, you asked me if I played this and my answer was not really, but did you play this?
[115:40.76]I'm waiting for mods.
[115:42.08]I might do it later this month because I like to do a like hardcore randomizer spawn in somewhere.
[115:52.03]rather than the plot that's you do that's I forgot it has the games you usually do like the hardcore runs right yeah the goofy stuff I forgot about that also I've been told there you know because you can do like romance options and rpgs now but there's no aliens you can't kiss an alien so you absolutely need mods to play this why why make an RPG in space I don't know
[116:23.14]life to the living death new trailer coming up we have sworn to protect the living from the lingering death keep the incarnate and the invisible separate to bring peace I'm just saying the game could have been on Earth if you weren't gonna like dangle the option in front of people
[116:49.45]Life to the dead.
[116:51.04]Life to the living.
[116:52.50]Death to the dead.
[116:53.30]Honoring my oath of sacrificing the living to bring me back.
[117:04.82]I'm not sure I can do that.
[117:09.12]Honor your oath or bring me back.
[117:13.47]But don't leave me like this.
[117:24.54]Dude, I so badly wish somebody would just do something wild.
[117:28.68]Show an unbelievable pre-rendered trailer and then cut to gameplay.
[117:33.20]That sucks.
[117:35.49]And it's awful.
[117:37.11]It's like not even the same fucking game.
[117:39.39]It looks washed out, terrible, unfinished.
[117:43.13]Make it look awful, awful.
[117:46.23]Do it on purpose.
[117:48.64]That could be you.
[118:00.28]They do this with a lot of games.
[118:01.48]Yeah, that's true, I guess.
[118:03.58]Usually they don't show the gameplay for those games, though.
[118:06.06]Yes, they don't.
[118:15.21]So, are you ready?
[118:19.93]I... I don't know.
[118:23.17]I guess I'll find out in June of... Oh, no, in like four days.

[119:06.29]Did I tell you that, like,
[119:07.79]caroline marshall I didn't tell you this I'm starting to become less of a mobile game Andy now because every mobile game that seems to come out wants to know the precise fucking location where I'm standing it's like oh excuse me yeah we want to know your email your name your address uh where you're currently standing what your favorite coffee place is hey can we quickly get a scan of your face
[119:29.93]it's just like oh by the way I went not just you know some jokey details like you know like your first your name your address oh you just want it you think that's that's funny when like Discord's like here's uh here's the things that we do want oh and we don't want you to ride a camel you know they like make a joke about all the data they're taking
[119:48.99]All I'm saying is... I don't know what... I don't know what... You don't know what I'm talking about?
[119:55.91]I don't know what you're talking about.
[119:58.67]Okay, don't worry about it.
[120:07.46]Are we just talking over somebody?
[120:10.00]Yeah, I'm trying to find... I know we can pause it, but...
[120:16.50]I don't want to be behind.
[120:18.78]We're shutting up a lot.
[120:20.59]We're better this year.
[120:31.71]And the game award goes to... Chia!
[120:46.09]Yeah, I don't like this new trend of, oh, hey, you want to play our mobile game?
[120:52.42]Can we like talk to your mother and your father?
[120:55.74]Do we have like the name of everybody you've ever met in your whole life?

[121:02.90]I'd like to thank our family for your trust and unbelievable talent.
[121:10.91]Kepler and Sony for believing in this crazy project.
[121:16.49]and the entire population of New Caledonia who championed and embraced cheer all along.
[121:24.44]Thank you, Mercy Oleti.
[121:28.12]Hello.
[121:43.35]I'm Abu Bakr Salim.
[121:44.71]I'm mainly known for my acting work in Raised by Wolves and Assassin's Creed Origins.
[121:51.99]But, but, but, that is not why I'm here.
[121:55.40]Oh, okay.
[121:59.72]Sorry, now this is crazy, man.
[122:03.52]I mean, I remember watching the Game Awards when I was younger, so being up here now is like .
[122:13.90]Look, I've loved games all my life.
[122:16.52]I mean, I played them all my life, man, from Kingdom Hearts, Gary's Mod.
[122:21.97]Gary's Mod.
[122:23.29]Wow, yeah.
[122:25.17]And it started with my dad, right?
[122:27.13]He got me into them.
[122:28.63]He understood, you know, that games are an art form.
[122:32.01]You know, it's a great space to enjoy and escape from the reality of the world.
[122:36.36]And he passed away a while back.
[122:37.48]And I'll tell you what, I'm still figuring it out.
[122:41.26]But four years ago, I decided that I needed to try and process my grief in a way that felt true to me and him.
[122:47.74]So I took the biggest risks of my life and threw everything that I had in making a game, a piece of art that honored him, an ode to the people we have loved and lost.
[123:02.36]So.
[123:09.16]So the reason I'm here tonight is because with the love and support of a lot of people here, I'm gonna take another big risk and I'm gonna show you what we've been building.
[123:17.93]Now I'm gonna offer you this game, a game from my old man.
[123:21.49]I hope you like it.
[123:31.07]Every story begins at the end of another.
[123:35.77]Each story carries with it the echoes of those that came before.
[123:40.25]Hmm.
[124:32.06]It's a sicko soundtrack.
[124:33.44]I cannot stop.
[124:35.02]This looks good.
[124:37.16]Kalunga, god of death, hear my plea.
[124:39.68]Kalunga, god of death, come to me.
[124:45.15]Show me you are ready.
[124:52.23]That's April.
[125:09.25]Oh, dude, I got so mad.
[125:10.93]Okay, Life is Strange has a Life is Strange remastered mode.
[125:16.30]And I bought the fucking old one.
[125:18.52]I was like, oh, because Holly had never played this before.
[125:20.62]It's like, oh, at least you've played Life is Strange.
[125:22.80]I bought the old version.
[125:23.72]Why is the old version still available?
[125:26.40]Why can't I buy the old version?
[125:27.84]Some people like the classic.
[125:31.31]It ran poorly on my PS5, and I was very unhappy about it.
[125:37.83]Wow.
[125:38.03]PS5 really...
[125:40.91]Really modern technology.
[125:44.04]Can't run Life is Strange.
[125:52.12]It's been 27 years y'all.
[125:53.15]Yeah, I could get it on a different platform, but I just I don't know.
[125:56.55]I thought it was Life is Strange.
[125:59.03]Because.
[126:01.05]We made a promise.
[126:07.32]That was Lost Records, a brand new world from the development team behind Life is Strange.
[126:12.14]Now we have a world premiere, a new look at a game based on an ongoing franchise of 18 years with over 850 million users worldwide.
[126:19.44]This entirely in-engine trailer shows off the blend between cartoon 3D graphics... Hold on, 850 million people?
[126:26.63]Or just a thousand?
[126:29.61]850 million people?
[126:30.85]Did I hear that wrong?
[126:31.81]I heard that completely wrong.
[126:34.83]I don't know what this is, but is that a billion people?
[126:38.45]Okay, if this is DFO.
[126:40.71]I don't know if that has McDonald's even served a billion people.
[126:51.28]Yeah, like 10 billion.
[126:52.14]I've been waiting for this.
[127:13.81]you've been waiting for this one I've been waiting for this for like five years it feels like they haven't shown anything in a long time you'll have to risk if it is what I think it is
[127:36.57]Whoever told me to turn the HDR off?
[127:38.11]What are you smoking?
[127:39.58]This is great on this television.
[127:52.97]Is that the game you were looking for?
[127:55.23]No, that's not it.
[127:56.73]I got baited by some logos in the beginning.
[127:59.97]That's rough.
[128:01.18]Looks cool.
[128:02.60]I don't know, maybe they abandoned the other one and made this.
[128:04.68]They're about to play music from an upcoming game that no one has heard of.
[128:08.50]They were working on Dungeon Fighter Online 2.
[128:10.62]They're calling it Project Barbecue.
[128:12.34]Looked really good.
[128:13.54]It's written by one of the greatest video game composers of all time, the legendary Nobuo Utamatsu.
[128:20.93]Here is the Game Awards Orchestra, led by Lauren Balfe, with lead vocals from Lauren Allred, debuting the theme song from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
[128:33.16]Enjoy.

[134:23.21]And tonight we have an exclusive.
[134:24.83]Wasn't Elden Ring most anticipated for like three years in a row?
[134:28.37]Probably.
[134:29.96]I'm sure that it would just win it every time.
[134:32.24]Do you still remember it?
[134:34.46]Fables about the stars.
[134:39.28]Its stories tell of what is and what was.
[134:42.90]Its pages will always reveal something new.
[134:45.10]Whoops, I fell on you!
[135:05.16]Those are unforgettable memories, but they are only a beginning.
[135:10.46]Did you replay this?
[135:12.54]No.
[135:13.57]I'm clean.
[135:14.71]I tried to start a few times.
[135:15.55]When God judges me, I'm clean.
[135:19.39]It won't all be merrymaking.
[135:21.65]Suffering and joy will both be added to the final draft.
[135:27.40]What if God judges you and he's like, oh, it says here that you did not play Genshin Impact.
[135:33.69]My most celebrated game that any of my creations have made.
[135:37.33]Is there a reason why you didn't play Genshin Impact?
[135:39.77]Like the sole game that requires you to get in here?
[135:42.85]I'm sorry.
[135:43.31]I was holding out for the wolf boy in Zenless Zone.
[135:46.77]He'd understand.
[135:52.62]I I have too much information for this this conversation this is not Genshin by the way I don't know why what who said that
[136:02.05]Is it?
[136:02.35]Wait, wait.
[136:02.63]Wait, I said that?
[136:03.15]I think it was.
[136:03.51]No, I think it was.
[136:04.17]It wasn't Genshin, it was something else.
[136:05.79]It was Honkai?
[136:06.43]Oh.
[136:06.55]I wanted to play that one too, just right.
[136:35.10]By the same creators.
[136:37.24]Oh, okay.
[136:51.28]The Fortnite Festival.
[136:53.75]Ster, we could be up there.
[136:57.65]You want to go to a concert together in Fortnite?
[137:01.87]Just me and you?
[137:04.03]No.
[137:05.81]okay but we could get our squad to be you know show what we're what our skin is we got an opportunity for four are you on team build or no build team no build all every single day of the week team no build that's too much to think about that's way too much to think about
[137:37.39]I already have trouble shooting people in games like that, let alone making a new home to live in every time I want to fight someone.
[137:45.94]You really think if you come to get Goku, he's going to build walls around himself when you come to fight him?
[137:54.25]Yeah, Goku's going to be out there in the field.
[137:57.87]He's going to be ready for a battle.
[138:06.93]I said this before, but I'm going to say it again because I think it's funny and I'm like one of five million people that have made this joke, but I don't care.
[138:13.07]Fortnite really has turned into the old Smash Brothers leaked contestant lists.
[138:21.98]It actually is that now.
[138:23.36]It genuinely is the old Smash Brothers leaks.
[138:26.84]I think it goes further than that.
[138:31.89]Like the wacky shit that'd be like, oh yeah, my dad works at Nintendo and here it is.
[138:36.52]It's like 400 people on it.
[138:38.20]You know, Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, the whole Griffin family's on this one.
[138:43.18]Peter Griffin with the Thanos gauntlet.
[138:45.54]Yep.
[138:48.78]Steve from The Office is up there too.
[138:50.79]And it's a picture and it's just an IRL picture of Steve Carell from The Office in that slot.
[138:57.51]Like the It's Happening image.
[139:06.59]dude is Steve Carell in Fortnite I feel like he could be I don't know odds are high dude you want to know what a great game would be to play is get somebody that's never played fucking Fortnite and just like do like a trivia show of like what is in the game and can they guess like name characters that you would have no idea from the studio that won best game direction in 2021 you get like 10 guesses and you get like three lives
[139:37.36]Arcane Studios.
[139:40.82]Attention, the sun is currently setting.
[139:42.89]All citizens are required
[139:56.70]Holy sweet
[140:17.34]Would you still get the haircut if your barber cut himself before he started even doing anything?
[140:21.24]I don't think so.
[140:22.30]I don't think so.
[140:23.16]I'm out of here, man.
[140:32.56]Lock up tight now.
[140:37.05]Night's just getting started.
[140:41.62]I was going to say, is that Blade?
[140:43.31]What the heck?
[140:44.05]It is Blade.
[140:45.61]Arcane Studios Blade.
[140:47.59]What?
[140:48.05]There you go.
[140:49.35]Joining me now are Dinka Vacava from Arcane Lyon and Bill Roseman from Marvel to tell us, how did this come together, guys?
[140:56.78]Well, Jeff, let me tell you, the secret superpower of Marvel games is our constant focus on bringing together world class talent with the fan favorite characters that they love.
[141:06.90]Now, we are huge fans of Arcane Lyon, not only
[141:10.68]because of the story-rich games they create with innovative gameplay, but because of their authentic passion.
[141:17.23]And that's why, on Blade's 50th anniversary, we are so honored to announce this true Marvel team-up.
[141:25.56]Yes, and after Dishonored and Deathloop, our first order of business was to make another very arcane game, but with a title that is easier to say in a French accent.
[141:35.27]And when we had, you know, when Sébastien Mitton and I had an opportunity to chat with Marvel, we said, okay, let's really challenge them.
[141:42.77]Let's present our wildest take on a superhero that we both love.
[141:48.23]we ate it up I mean the arcane touch fits blade like his trademark trench coat and I mean think about it it's it's a mature action adventure game single player where you get to play blade your way okay I thought that they really did this set I thought those were all swords hanging on the wall why this character
[142:11.31]Well, he's the daywalker.
[142:13.27]Eric Brooks is half-man, half-vampire, torn between the warm society of the living and the rushing power of the undead.
[142:20.26]And as a kid of mixed origins, his dual heritage resonated with me.
[142:25.74]So yes, it is a dream to be making a game about Blade in Paris, my hometown.
[142:31.46]You know, if... Well, if...
[142:39.59]If my hometown was Walden, and we shared it with bloodthirsty invaders that come out as soon as the sun goes down.
[142:46.00]That would be a bit of crap.
[142:48.82]Anything else you can tell us about the game?
[142:50.44]I know it's pretty early, right?
[142:53.46]I can tell you one thing.
[142:55.27]The entire team at Arcane Lyon is pouring so much love into this.
[143:00.43]It's like we're doing away with health potions.
[143:01.89]Third-person action adventure set in the heart of Paris.
[143:06.01]So please sit back, let us cook, and voila!
[143:10.47]Merci beaucoup!
[143:11.55]Merci!
[143:12.67]Wow!
[143:15.49]Stunts, too.

[143:43.15]You guys didn't.

[146:40.28]What a journey it's been.
[146:41.54]I hope they receive the award and he's still in the background yelling at someone.
[146:44.58]Video games are awesome.
[146:46.04]This is an incredible moment.
[146:47.68]From launch to 1.5 to 2.0 in Phantom Liberty and now the Ultimate Edition.
[146:55.07]Like...
[146:56.28]The tenacity and the resilience of the team and just wanting to bring forward stories.
[147:01.38]This game got dragged so much a few years ago.
[147:04.76]And everybody on the team got laser eyes and made it one of the most fun games you could play now, right?
[147:09.99]I've heard good things about the DLC.
[147:11.51]But I'm still waiting to find the time.
[147:12.61]Looking forward to it.
[147:19.31]I mean, I have to include here our amazing players.
[147:23.09]They've been with us throughout the whole journey, gave us feedback, made funny memes, videos, you know, wrote posts on Twitter, on Reddit.
[147:32.94]It was amazing, you know, to see the reception of the players when they were actually getting all of those updates.
[147:39.72]Just recently, we shipped update 2.1 for Cyberpunk 2077.
[147:44.75]And it's for all of you.
[147:46.43]Thank you so much.
[147:48.21]Thank you.
[147:48.93]Thank you.
[147:52.84]Well, I mean, honestly, like No Man's Sky, yeah.
[147:55.10]If it's like, hey, man, your game sucks.
[147:56.88]Congratulations, guys.
[147:58.16]Our next guest has worked on some truly memorable games over the past 20 years, like GTA 5, Bully, Need for Speed Underground, and the Red Dead Redemption series.
[148:07.44]Now he leads a new studio, Lightspeed LA.
[148:10.16]Steve C. Martin is here to unveil a brand new project.
[148:13.76]Steve?
[148:14.76]Thanks, Jeff.
[148:15.34]Great to have you here.
[148:16.22]You showed this to me earlier this year.
[148:18.18]Tell us a bit about it.
[148:19.68]It's an honor to be here, so thanks for having us.
[148:22.51]Over the past few years at Lightspeed LA, myself and a remarkable team of over 200 talented, diverse industry veterans and fresh new talent have been in deep development on a fully original AAA futuristic open world game.
[148:41.48]Tonight, we're really excited to offer you all a sneak peek at what we've been working on.
[148:50.00]Seriously, I'm so excited to share so much more with you in the future.
[148:54.03]But for now, I hope you all enjoy this first taste.
[148:57.26]Amazing.
[148:57.68]Let's take a look, Steve.
[148:58.78]Here we go.
[148:59.65]Futuristic future space cyber in space and there's lights and light and lighting and red and blue and green neon lights.
[149:09.29]Don't you just want to bake bread as somebody from like a thousand years ago?
[149:12.21]Like, I want to go back.
[149:14.21]Let's go back to like back when people, you know, Amish loading up fucking hay into shit.
[149:20.61]I want to go do something old.
[149:24.30]They do that all the time, too.
[149:25.76]Not that old.
[149:26.90]Old enough where... Oh, shut up.
[149:33.61]He could go do it.
[149:36.29]Excuse us.
[150:20.71]It's kind of constant conflict-y.
[150:41.77]I don't know what the actual range is for how constant conflict your game is versus how good it is when it comes out.
[150:49.67]Like how much constant conflict do you show in the trailer versus how good is the game when it comes out?
[151:10.71]Now open your eyes.
[151:12.19]Slow me.
[151:22.79]Take a breath and look around you I was a little bit too much action It's probably bad because there's action
[151:53.45]How much jumping, sliding, and shooting is there in a trailer and is the game any good?
[152:00.86]Why not just walk?
[152:02.58]Back in the olden days, you could just walk.
[152:05.22]Horse and buggy at best.
[152:10.13]That was a lot of conflict in that one.
[152:17.51]That was the first Descendant, which is launching the summer of 2024 from Nexon.
[152:22.45]Now we have a new look at Hoyoverse's next big game, Zenless Zone Zero, an urban fantasy ARPG.
[152:28.37]I had my eye on this one for a while.
[152:30.09]We had it at Gamescom, and we're excited to unveil their latest announcement right here at TGA.
[152:37.57]Check out this wolf boy.
[152:38.55]Do you know about this?
[152:42.79]Keep your eyes peeled.
[152:44.27]You're never going to forget.
[152:50.26]Okay.
[152:52.59]Oh, human.
[152:53.33]Oh, yeah.
[153:25.15]Is this game's company on the stock market?
[153:28.79]Can I ask that?
[153:31.89]I think that's the best take you can have.
[153:40.52]I mean, it's like... They make really popular shit, and here it is.
[153:46.78]There's another one now, and this is gonna be probably just as popular and probably just as fun.
[153:51.06]Yeah, I'm just asking.
[153:59.19]This is not financial advice, obviously, but I'm just asking a question.
[154:11.52]When is it just as fun laughing my ass off?
[154:17.57]I don't know.
[154:21.69]I haven't played them.
[154:22.79]People like them a lot, though.
[154:43.17]Every bullet fired is a minus one.
[154:45.15]There's too much action.
[154:50.20]But there has not been a slide yet.
[154:52.58]So hold on.
[154:53.34]There's sliding everywhere.
[154:54.62]There just was.
[154:55.02]That was a slide right there.
[154:56.88]No, no, hold on.
[154:58.38]No, wait.
[154:58.94]Let me reiterate this.
[155:00.34]A human sliding.
[155:02.35]Human sliding.
[155:03.59]Not a big Gundam thing.
[155:05.09]I'm talking a human slide has not been shown yet.
[155:08.63]Why does it have to be human?
[155:10.49]It has to be a human... A human?
[155:13.19]It's got to be human enough.
[155:17.11]No, it has to be a human sliding with a gun.
[155:19.67]Okay, comparison, comparison.
[155:21.09]Armored Core's trailer was close-ups of robot's eyes.
[155:24.65]This is actual gameplay.
[155:26.01]So you're saying this is going to be worse because it doesn't do a slow pan into the robot.
[155:31.93]What?
[155:32.39]No, I'm saying that there's no human sliding with a gun, so I can't make an assessment of this yet.
[155:39.56]We brought in gamers to demo the latest Cyberpunk update.
[155:42.08]But we haven't told them what they're playing on.
[155:45.34]Let's see what happens when they find out.
[155:46.84]This looks amazing.
[155:48.42]Ray tracing is beautiful.
[155:49.47]Yeah, it's super real.
[155:51.21]What do you think is powering your gaming?
[155:52.83]Like a 4090?
[155:53.09]40 series?
[155:53.75]They're actually playing on a Chromebook Plus.
[155:57.03]I thought they were going to do like a hamster or something.
[156:00.21]Which you don't know.
[156:01.47]This is a hamster on a hamster wheel.
[156:03.56]I thought there was like a weird bit they were doing.
[156:05.14]Chromebook.
[156:15.09]We're on very different wavelengths right now.
[156:19.98]I'm losing you, man.
[156:23.90]What was your take on that?
[156:26.00]I thought they were advertising a PC.
[156:31.86]Yeah, but did you see what he said?
[156:34.24]He's like, you'll have no idea what's powering this computer you're playing on.
[156:37.44]I think he missed the jokey part of that they were showing.
[156:43.31]yeah maybe galaxy's most advanced weaponry fight alongside a squad worth dying for join the helldivers what didn't we make a video on this like nine years ago the first one yeah that was top down too this looks actually kind of interesting I'd play it what is your life

[161:03.12]Wait, where did he come from?
[161:06.92]The guy with the iPad.
[161:36.93]I feel like the guy in the middle drank a magic potion that's teleporting him to another world and he's just kind of playing along with it.
[161:43.49]Whoa, this is crazy!
[161:47.21]The guys, you can't see their face.
[161:48.85]One of them is Reggie.
[161:50.92]And then he does like the next introduction.
[161:57.40]Oh, one of the dancers you mean?
[161:58.64]Yeah, he just takes the masks off and starts doing the next reading of like who the nominees are.
[162:05.30]I mean that was really well made that was really well choreographed that was really good thank you to the band sam lake remedy epic I'm just a little confused of what it was a great piece of media something you will only see right here on the game awards now it's time for an update on a game we announced that was in the game in 2017. hey get the out of here the same story the same fate
[162:36.20]You're doing alright.
[162:37.14]You're doing alright.
[162:38.00]That was very hostile.
[162:41.06]Are we watching the same show?
[162:45.39]Yeah.
[162:46.45]I played this right before.
[162:48.21]What is this called?
[162:49.75]GTFO.
[162:52.05]Did you know you can't type GTFO in a Twitch title?
[162:54.98]No, it says this might be hostile and offensive.
[163:01.82]Final battle.
[163:13.79]Get the fuck out.
[163:18.55]Come on.
[163:19.95]Yeah, get the fuck out.
[163:21.80]Come on.
[163:23.28]You're acting out again.
[163:26.12]Joining me now is Ulf from Ten Chambers.
[163:28.26]Crazy, that was six years ago we announced GTFO, and that's the final chapter.
[163:32.91]You've got a free weekend on Steam.
[163:34.65]Looks fantastic, but I think there's a little something more you're also working on, right?
[163:39.77]Yeah, first of all, I have to say thank you for having me again.
[163:44.45]Of course.
[163:44.85]I don't know why you brought it up.
[163:46.11]Delicious menu.
[163:48.30]This suit is fucking amazing.
[163:51.62]You look good, too.
[163:52.48]Your games look great.
[163:53.84]Anyway, yeah, we're working on something new, and it's like a passion project like all our projects are.
[164:02.34]If you were going for payday, things like that, so back to some heist stuff.
[164:05.68]You said you played GTFO?
[164:06.74]Yeah, so now we're back to doing a heist game.
[164:08.54]Yeah, right before Game Awards.
[164:09.98]And it's sort of a sci-fi thing that I've been dreaming up since I was a kid, basically.
[164:14.18]Yeah, I liked it.
[164:14.97]And yeah, it's what it is.
[164:17.29]Should we announce it to the world?
[164:18.91]Yes, we should.
[164:19.89]You've been working on this for a number of years.
[164:21.39]It's meant for four people, and we didn't have four people, but it seems like it would be really tense with it.
[164:25.11]It's very difficult with playing with two.
[164:28.03]So this is a new game.
[164:29.14]Okay.
[164:32.12]Mr. Bowman, your reservation at Manon Ephes is in one... Cancel the reservation.
[164:36.92]Reset the procedure.
[164:38.68]Continued neuro-proding may severely damage the... Reset the procedure.
[164:43.69]Yes, standing by.
[164:44.83]Inject.
[164:45.43]I'm Mr. Bowman.
[164:50.71]Your subconscious was just spilling the beans about your recent Akojima district break.
[164:55.98]Do a lot of running, a lot of sliding.
[164:58.08]You upset?
[165:00.18]There's no use in fighting.

[165:50.24]I'm sorry.
[166:01.75]I just think dubstep is funny.
[166:09.45]Gameplay is available to look at.
[166:10.69]I would take a look.
[166:18.52]That was a pretty big slide.
[166:33.22]That's a bionic commando.
[166:34.64]I don't know.
[166:54.84]Oh, with the light on the... You see how there's a light on it?
[166:57.33]Oh, it's sliding.
[167:04.43]Quick draw.
[167:13.40]Good to go.
[167:17.46]Easy in, easy out.
[167:21.28]That's our ride.
[167:31.80]Exoborn.
[167:32.48]That was Exoborn.
[167:38.77]That was all gameplay.
[167:39.91]Exopuke.
[167:55.22]Master the apocalypse, as they say.
[167:57.00]Much more is coming up in 2024 on ExoBurp.
[167:59.15]I think this will be funner titles.
[168:00.63]Now, please welcome the voice of Loki in Asgard's Wrath 2, one of the most ambitious and anticipated VR games yet, Matt Mercer.
[168:13.54]I do not deserve a single +2 for that one.
[168:15.50]I was testing you to see how you were today.
[168:17.20]Did you say something?
[168:20.56]So beyond excited to show you this trailer for Asgard's Wrath 2.
[168:23.80]You're in your own world over there.
[168:24.92]I was paying attention to the show.
[168:27.53]It's just been absolutely amazing.
[168:30.21]And after playing Asgard's Wrath 2 as a lifelong gamer, I'm
[168:35.25]Honestly, blown away.
[168:36.27]So I'm honored to be a part of this franchise and want to thank everyone at Sanzaru Games, at Oculus Studios, and MetaQuest.
[168:46.48]So without further ado, let's enjoy the trailer for Asgard's Wrath 2.
[168:50.78]I thought I was going to say we are very small.
[169:01.46]Take everything from mortals.
[169:13.85]tonight spirits their rightful passage turn worlds to ash this might be kind of good actually you allowed loki to deceive you now his chaos reigns I just got a quest I came with it for free so I'm like excited to see what game I have a guardian this one and with each possession
[169:51.03]I won't be doing that.
[169:53.11]This is kind of unrealistic.
[169:57.46]They didn't show the hand shaking a million miles per hour.
[170:00.50]They also didn't show the four misses, the chat popping up.
[170:06.91]the please show the guidance chaperone squares everywhere.
[170:12.16]You stand still and look at both of your hands, one left, then right.
[170:32.30]This looks kind of fun though.
[170:34.77]I'm going to hold off on my reservations on this one.
[170:41.23]VR is in a weird spot, I think.
[170:44.19]It's like companies want to make stuff for it, but they don't want to go all in and make like full AAA experiences for VR.
[170:51.73]I don't know if anybody ever will.
[170:52.77]We've seen like three ever.
[170:55.47]Think about how long VR has been out for.
[170:57.05]We have like two real AAA games that have ever released in like six years.
[171:03.66]And one of them was Alex.
[171:07.08]And actually the only one might be Alex, honestly.
[171:11.66]It's been an amazing year, not just for games, but for adaptations of the games we love.
[171:16.72]Right now, we have an exclusive look at the highly anticipated new series, Fallout.
[171:25.97]Oh.
[171:26.27]Oh, okay.
[171:26.75]This is cool.
[171:27.49]Hello there.
[171:27.99]Now, how about we turn on some lights?
[171:56.83]Well, you know what they say.
[171:58.59]War never changes.
[172:04.14]Oh, is that it?
[172:06.04]Okay, this is either going to be a really awesome adaptation or truly terrible.
[172:11.36]I don't know which one it's going to be.
[172:14.30]It might be really good.
[172:15.50]I don't know if there's an in-between on this show.
[172:23.85]What's up, y'all?
[172:25.01]I hope you don't mind.
[172:26.19]We brought a little extra security.
[172:30.23]Thank you for having us.
[172:31.53]And we are incredibly excited for you all to see Fallout on Prime this April.
[172:36.33]But our real honor tonight is that we're here to hand out the award for best adaptation.
[172:41.51]He grabs the mic, he's like, I'm not fucking around.
[172:43.21]I really am security here.
[172:44.27]I'll fucking obliterate everybody.
[172:47.45]You with the popcorn, I just saw you drop popcorn on the fucking ground.
[172:51.15]That guy was talking earlier, yeah.
[172:52.43]Throwing a powerbomb in front of a fucking table.
[172:55.95]Jonathan Nolan, Mr. Howard.
[172:58.29]Good catch, buddy.
[172:59.47]That guy was talking earlier.
[173:01.09]We should probably hurry this up.
[173:02.45]I don't think he can breathe in there.
[173:03.69]Yeah, how you doing, big man?
[173:06.23]Okay, alright, alright, let's go.
[173:08.65]Okay, so this year, video games and film and television were bigger and better than ever before.
[173:14.22]Here are the nominees for Best Adaptation.
[173:18.52]Best Adaptation.
[173:20.82]The vampire messiah will come.
[173:23.34]I pray for you, Victor Belmont.
[173:25.86]I vote Castlevania.
[173:27.58]My wife drew a flower in it.
[173:29.22]If you don't think there's hope for the world... Hey, that show was fucking amazing.
[173:39.81]Do you think it's Mario?
[173:40.95]I don't think so.
[173:42.63]I think it's Castlevania.
[173:43.57]You think it's Castlevania?
[173:45.07]Is that what you think?
[173:47.41]There's this really cool scene with a flower in it.
[173:48.86]The last game goes to The Last of Us.
[174:00.63]You could lie to me and tell me what The Last of Us story is and I'd believe you.
[174:03.21]I've never played any of it.
[174:06.43]You can literally just lie to me and make up an entire thing and I'd be like, oh cool.
[174:09.68]There's like a zombie outbreak, but they need to find the cure.
[174:12.42]True or false?
[174:18.69]OK, wait, wait, we start over?
[174:19.75]Yeah.
[174:23.29]You didn't hear what I said?
[174:24.83]No, no, I did, but I want to make sure I clarify.
[174:26.47]But I want to talk over.
[174:27.31]They just wanted to know more.
[174:28.65]...watching up in Canada, getting ready for season two.
[174:31.73]Huge thank out to our Naidog family.
[174:34.27]This wouldn't exist without all your incredible hard work.
[174:37.15]Big thanks to HBO and the support they've given us.
[174:40.31]And a lot of big thanks to our Last of Us community.
[174:43.08]None of this exists without you.
[174:44.62]Thank you so much.
[174:46.67]We also want to thank our partners at Sony Pictures.
[174:49.57]A special shout out to Carter Swan and the whole PlayStation Productions team and everyone at PlayStation.
[174:55.26]Thanks so much.
[174:55.90]Thank you.
[174:57.56]Okay, so it was a zombie outbreak.
[175:01.06]There's a zombie outbreak and they need to find a cure.
[175:03.64]True.
[175:06.57]That's what you wanted to wait to reiterate it and then just say true.
[175:09.81]Well, yeah, because I didn't want to talk over the speeches.
[175:12.99]Alright, so I would say true.
[175:14.49]Yes, that's the plot of the game.
[175:17.90]Alright.
[175:18.90]Is that accurate?
[175:19.50]Are you... Yeah, no, it's... I think that's a pretty concise summary.
[175:24.13]Oh, I thought you were quizzing me on it.
[175:26.87]Like, you were like, okay, well, hold on.
[175:28.03]Let me give you a quiz.
[175:30.97]No, I was being pretty straight to the point.
[175:33.65]That was just right to the point.
[175:35.43]There was no follow-up there.
[175:36.77]It was just, do you think it's a zombie outbreak where you have to find the... That's it.
[175:40.94]That's the only thing you want to ask me about that game.
[175:43.34]What else happens in a zombie story?
[175:45.66]I don't know.
[175:47.50]If they cure it, it's over.
[175:48.74]That's true.
[175:51.10]It'd be kind of funny if there was a zombie movie or a zombie game where it was like, oh, here it comes.
[175:57.15]Zombies everywhere.
[175:58.69]The virus is here and it's getting everybody and you turn into a zombie.
[176:02.23]And like after like an hour of gameplay, there's a thing on one of the radios you can click on that's like, the cure is found.
[176:08.49]Everything is going to be fine.
[176:09.51]We're going to go back to normal.
[176:11.77]And it actually does.
[176:12.83]And then you have to play like a different game.
[176:15.11]There's more of a...
[176:20.31]Would you play AR games on the street?
[176:23.85]Like this?
[176:25.45]Me and you?
[176:26.07]No, because I'm afraid of getting hit by a car.
[176:41.32]It's like, no, dude, I don't want to, like, be like, oh, there's a squeeze-a-doe!
[176:45.81]Like, and run and, like, try to find and catch the squeeze-a-doe on my screen and I get hit by a fucking cyclist.
[176:50.75]No.
[176:50.85]I mean, it's evolved over time, especially as I've gotten into AAA.
[176:57.18]Well, guess what, everybody?
[177:00.96]Hindsight is a narrative exploration game which spans the life of a woman named Mary.
[177:06.98]It's taking a core of something that happened in my life, keeping that and fictionalizing the rest of it.
[177:14.73]Whenever someone tells me that they've cried from something that I've made, it's always when people cry is where I feel, yes, I want to keep doing that.
[177:22.01]I want to keep making people feel things.
[177:23.72]I talked two seconds ago.
[177:26.66]We just had a conversation.
[177:31.82]You haven't said anything in 10 seconds.
[177:36.14]Are you still here?
[177:45.91]You know what?
[177:46.85]True though.
[177:48.09]True that guy.
[178:02.87]He lied!
[178:23.44]Holy shit, is this all the stuff that they've done to No Man's Sky?
[178:28.34]Are these all expansions that they put in this game?
[178:32.90]Yeah, they be doing it.
[178:40.73]Oh my god.
[178:41.83]Yeah.
[178:46.34]But what was best ongoing game?
[178:49.10]Was it Baldur's Gate or something?
[178:54.45]That might be better with No Man's Sky.
[178:56.51]Yeah, but that's newer.
[178:57.93]Ten years ago with this guy right here, Sean Murray.
[179:01.31]Sean, looks like the content keeps rolling in 2024.
[179:04.25]What does the next decade look like for Hello Games?
[179:08.95]Well, to start with, next year is going to be a really big year for No Man's Sky.
[179:13.52]Like you said, I've been working on it for ten years now.
[179:16.36]And I still really love it, still really enjoy it.
[179:19.00]But what people don't know is that for the last five years, we've been working on something new.
[179:24.70]Oh, another game.
[179:25.80]Yeah, something very different.
[179:28.22]Something maybe more ambitious.
[179:31.47]You know, for... Here we go.
[179:34.75]LAUGHTER
[179:37.49]Tell us a bit about it, Sean.
[179:40.05]Well, for No Man's Sky, we generated a whole universe of kind of sparse, alien-looking planets.
[179:47.44]And that wasn't easy.
[179:49.40]You know, it was hard, but there is something that's much harder that we wanted to do.
[179:53.91]For our new game, we wanted to create an Earth.
[179:58.36]You know, something as varied, a planet that is as varied as a universe, something bigger than Earth, something with mountains, real mountains, not video game mountains, but mountains that are miles high, taller than Everest, that when you climb to the top of them and look out, you can see rivers and canyons.
[180:20.44]and continents you know you can see I think he's God so he's just like an open let him cook for a little bit yeah I mean the first real open world right something without boundaries uh and we're gonna let everyone play in it together it's you know a place where people can live out their sort of adventures together
[180:41.64]Well, we can't wait to take a look at it.
[180:44.42]We have anything tonight or future?
[180:46.80]Yes.
[180:47.74]So we have a trailer.
[180:49.10]Oh.
[180:50.82]And, you know, it's quite a small team that's working on us.
[180:53.78]I hope it's not like Goose Poop 2 or something where it's, oh, look, it's Europe.
[180:57.87]We're...
[181:01.37]We're very excited to share this.
[181:03.17]You and I have been talking about this one for years.
[181:04.81]Yeah, we're super nervous, you know, but really excited if people like it.
[181:12.09]This is a game I would like to still be updating 10 years from now.
[181:16.31]Alright, so Game Awards 2033.
[181:19.15]We'll be back.
[181:19.75]But no, let's take a look.
[181:21.30]This is such an incredible project, and I'm honored that we get to show it off.
[181:24.64]Should we do it, Sean?
[181:25.74]Yeah, let's do it.
[181:26.48]Here we go.
[181:26.94]Let's do it.
[181:29.44]I'm very excited.
[181:45.62]Hey, Ster.
[181:46.98]Huh?
[181:48.10]Did you see what it just said?
[181:51.08]It said it was Earth, but there were skeletons walking around.
[181:54.24]He's eating a sandwich, I think.
[181:55.44]Are you eating?
[181:56.90]Are you eating right now?
[181:58.04]I am not eating.
[181:58.82]It said all in-game multiplayer footage.
[182:07.25]It's all multiplayer in-game footage.
[182:09.25]Okay.
[182:14.39]you were upset about that before okay just feeling like the original uh you know no I don't you know like when the bird took off like perfectly timed in front of them I just feel like there's a lot of wildlife showing up like as you walk I feel like this feels
[182:39.47]That was a me response, and you know it.
[182:41.97]That was like a, hey, what do you think about this?
[182:43.59]Well, I don't know, you know.
[182:45.01]I don't know, you know.
[182:49.88]That's what I would say.
[183:00.80]I'm just saying, I hope this is all in the game.
[183:09.28]You don't think there's a giant stone Epcot not affiliated with Disney at all?
[183:13.60]You don't think you can go in there and mess with some fucking runes?
[183:18.45]You don't have any idea what you're up against here.
[183:28.28]Light, no fire.
[183:33.53]Remember, that comes from an independent team.
[183:37.00]Absolutely incredible.
[183:37.64]I've been waiting for years to show that to you.
[183:39.78]And again, created by the team at Hello Games.
[183:42.32]So very, very exciting.
[183:44.12]And I'm excited to see games like that.
[183:45.90]I was not excited for No Man's Sky, but I'm more into that kind of game.
[183:49.68]That looks interesting to me.
[183:51.46]Now join me in welcoming to the stage, actor Simu Liu.
[184:05.21]What's up, everybody?
[184:06.65]How y'all doing tonight?
[184:07.61]My God, there's so many of you.
[184:11.07]You guys all look so, so beautiful.
[184:13.27]Alright, first off, I want to address the elephant in the room.
[184:16.81]Does he hang on me?
[184:18.29]My foot's fine, you guys.
[184:20.01]I did tear my Achilles.
[184:22.64]I wasn't riding a dragon.
[184:23.88]I was playing pickup basketball in Miami.
[184:27.55]I wish there were a better story to this, you guys, but the story is this.
[184:31.60]You know, as you age, as you get older, you know, particularly as you cross the 30 threshold, your body starts to break down, alright?
[184:39.62]Things start happening, unless you're Anthony Mackie, for whom I think the laws of age don't apply.
[184:45.32]Dude, you know what?
[184:45.80]If this ever happens to me, I'm getting a suit tailored to go over the boot and have a big shoe that goes over the boot, too, like a big, nice dress shoe.
[184:53.03]You're getting a Buzz Lightyear costume.
[184:55.31]Like, no one needs to know.
[184:58.03]Now, I'm here to share something that I'm really, really excited about.
[185:02.90]I recently got a chance to team up with Frost Giant on their new real-time strategy game, Stormgate.
[185:08.58]Now, RTS is a genre that I was absolutely obsessed with as a kid.
[185:12.38]I loved building armies and obliterating my enemies in Age of Empires, Command & Conqueror, and of course, my absolute all-time favorite game, StarCraft.
[185:21.61]You know, he was probably sitting around feeling like right after it happened, he was probably just like, fuck.
[185:24.45]I'm presenting at the Game Awards in three days.
[185:26.81]Come on.
[185:27.17]I can imagine how probably horrible it must have been.
[185:28.89]Just like, what the fuck?
[185:43.68]who are just as obsessed with RTS as I am.
[185:45.88]And in addition to competitive and co-op modes in the game, it's got an ongoing campaign that was written by frost giant with a little help from the legend.
[185:55.50]And so like, yes, do you like her more after she turns into a bugger before the first reveal of a pretty bad-ass new character?
[186:04.15]I may or may not have gotten to voice.
[186:05.97]Let's have a look.
[186:07.03]I don't know who you, who you just, who you're talking about.
[186:09.81]Um,
[186:12.30]kerrigan queen of blades leader of the zerg okay okay um I'm talking bug form or pre-bug or post bug wait well there are three forms but you okay there's bug and not bug and then also later she's not bugged but also there's before bug god's name have we done
[186:40.86]I don't know the human one.
[186:45.82]OK, dude.
[186:48.24]I mean, you ask questions, you're going to get working pretty basic answer.
[186:53.34]Wrong answer.
[187:03.37]Vanilla Andy.
[187:04.53]I don't even know what this character looks like.
[187:11.31]I don't know who Kerrigan is.
[187:13.07]I know who Kerrigan is, but I don't know the character.
[187:16.16]OK, OK, let me let me like translate Sylvanas.
[187:19.68]Sylvanas before she's undead or after she's undead.
[187:24.30]That was me.
[187:30.02]See, I wasn't looking at the screen.
[187:31.76]I thought I thought that was you just doing that.
[187:34.30]Like I thought you just like just puke or something.
[187:38.20]I just heard that.
[187:38.80]I was like, what is the best action adventure game?
[187:42.16]Best action adventure game.
[187:47.04]Dead or undead, as long as she was the same person, I don't fucking care, okay?
[187:54.49]Doesn't she kill everyone?
[187:55.53]I care a lot.
[188:01.57]You like Sylvanas for her personality?
[188:08.49]Dude, I skipped every WoW cutscene.
[188:11.73]The only ones I watched were the ones where they showed the fucking warlock leaning in and the infernal behind him.
[188:19.53]I haven't watched one in 20 years.
[188:25.52]Well, if you haven't kept up, she's smarter than the jailer.
[188:29.04]I know that.
[188:34.23]Oh, here you go, buddy.
[188:40.07]You talked over a Tears of the Kingdom win?
[188:42.29]It'll win five more things in ten minutes, don't worry.
[188:46.38]I'm so glad to be able to be here to accept this award on behalf of everyone who worked together to create this game.
[189:02.24]This always scares me because everybody has a phone lock of like a minute.
[189:04.66]And if that goes and you have to unlock your phone, it's like, oh shit!
[189:07.02]What was I just saying?
[189:07.70]Thank you very much, players.
[189:31.55]Everyone's unique approach to playing this game can become their own personal story as an adventure through the lands of Hyrule.
[189:39.36]That's it.
[189:41.53]You didn't say anything else.
[189:42.91]Why?
[189:43.17]Thank you so much.
[189:46.13]Why did you write that?
[189:52.65]There was no precursor to that.
[189:57.13]I am happy now to announce winners in a few more categories of the Game Awards.
[190:01.06]Here are the nominees for Best RPG, Baldur's Gate 3, Final Fantasy 16, Lies of P, Sea of Stars, and Starfield.
[190:11.20]What do you think?
[190:11.58]And the Game Award goes to Baldur's Gate 3.
[190:17.22]If they could show the percentages, do you think that's 95%?
[190:19.00]Higher.
[190:19.16]100.
[190:19.20]I heard City Skylines 2 did not launch in a good state.
[190:21.26]I heard it's not good.
[190:37.81]I've heard the same, but that probably happens after you have a game with $800 worth of DLC.
[190:42.40]Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbo Charge and the Crew Motor Fest.
[190:46.92]Hot Wheels Unleashed.
[190:47.64]Party Animals was fun.

[192:03.78]You think it's also funny that this is not playing on the globe right now, which costs a lot of money.
[192:08.22]It's playing on a digital globe that is just on our screen right now.
[192:12.25]They're breaking out of the globe.
[192:13.81]They just got out of the globe.
[192:14.99]Guys, they're out of the globe.
[192:17.13]Guys, I'm going to get hit by a car trying to find these people on fucking AR.
[192:23.73]They made it into the real world.
[192:37.94]Are you avoiding this guy?
[192:39.70]If we come out of that casino, we're avoiding this, right?
[192:42.08]We're like, let's go somewhere else.
[192:43.38]I don't even notice that guy in Vegas.
[192:47.78]It's like, yeah, that's just another guy juggling globes over there.
[192:54.51]Whatever.
[192:55.03]I see what you mean.
[192:57.65]There's so much stimulation in Vegas that you actually might just look over there and be like, whatever.
[193:01.55]There's a guy doing juggling over there and he's in a cartoon.
[193:05.49]Wow, Vegas sure is crazy.
[193:12.23]This song choice is pretty damn good.
[193:26.90]Really?
[193:27.26]Have you heard the soundtrack?
[193:31.16]No, I just heard the first 10 seconds of that song.
[193:33.98]Good soundtrack.
[193:36.82]Sounds pretty great.
[193:42.52]why are you not like screaming over this because I know already oh you already know yeah and they added like a 3v3 oh I'm sorry I spoiled it
[194:11.74]Oh.
[194:16.46]What the fuck?
[194:17.30]Did I get an ad?
[194:19.68]Wait, I'm confused.
[194:20.84]It looks like an ad.
[194:27.43]I, okay.
[194:28.37]It is an ad.
[194:29.77]Okay, we all got an ad.
[194:33.23]I hope I did not just like inadvertently make fun of a game that was here accidentally because I was about to be very sad about that.
[194:42.42]I thought it was a YouTube ad, like I got an actual ad on my client.
[194:56.28]I wonder how much it costs to buy... Is the name of the gameplay now?
[195:01.09]That's very out of the point.
[195:02.93]Dude, okay, what if you had enough money to do a YouTube ad, but not to... Like, I don't know how much it costs to do a YouTube... Not a YouTube, a Game Awards ad?
[195:12.76]Like a Game Awards premiere?
[195:13.78]Do you have to pay?
[195:14.48]I assume so.
[195:18.73]Do you think it's more cost effective to run YouTube ads during this that everybody's watching?
[195:24.48]Like if everyone's just on the website now than actually paying to be here?
[195:27.74]I have to imagine that they aren't having ads run during the live stream.
[195:34.10]Well, I just mean like people that are on YouTube.
[195:36.90]Like they just know people are on YouTube right now.
[195:38.33]They'd be jumping around.
[195:38.99]What?
[195:41.85]We have to be quiet.
[195:43.87]Hold on.
[195:44.61]I know.
[195:44.93]What are you on about?
[195:57.69]What the hell is an iconoclastic defense system?
[196:01.04]I've a feeling we're about to find out, and that we will not like the answer.
[196:06.44]Then we'd better cut this short.
[196:14.73]Welcome, my friends, to Mysidia.
[196:42.64]Cool.
[196:43.34]I like the base game.
[196:44.78]I didn't beat it though.
[196:45.42]Why didn't they show that before when they said we have something else for Final Fantasy fans rather than showing the Apex Legends skin?
[196:53.13]With Echoes of the Fallen, which is out tonight on PlayStation 5.
[196:56.95]There's a shout out drop for you.
[196:58.69]Now to present our next award, Best Game Direction, please welcome one of our industry's greatest creative forces, the creator of Call of Duty and Global GM for Star Wars Jedi, Battlefield, Titanfall, and Apex Legends, Vince Sampella.
[197:16.67]Hey, so we're here to announce Titanfall 3.
[197:19.31]Titanfall 3.
[197:21.25]Hey, so we got a big announcement.
[197:24.47]Titanfall 3.
[197:26.75]Alright, good evening, everyone.
[197:29.49]So, game design can be chaos.
[197:32.07]Actually, let me rephrase that.
[197:33.55]The best game design is almost always part chaos, right?
[197:37.53]Today, it's really normal for teams of hundreds to work for years on huge open worlds that are condensed into one package.
[197:45.48]When that chaos has somehow been harnessed into a cohesive artistic expression, that's great game design.
[197:51.62]So tonight, I'm proud to present the nominees for Best Game Direction.
[197:57.33]Best game direction.
[197:58.43]How do you want the story that lives in your head?
[198:03.06]What's the amount of awards a game wins before you play it immediately, like a day or two later?
[198:08.62]Played Disco Elysium?
[198:11.56]No.
[198:12.58]Then the answer is it has to win a lot of freaking awards.
[198:19.38]Link, you are our final hope.
[198:21.82]You must find me.
[198:26.93]Amazing.
[198:28.43]And the winner is... Alan Wake II!
[198:32.73]I mean, that's another one.
[198:40.43]That's another one.
[198:45.24]Yeah, I mean, I... I didn't expect much out of Alan Wake, but apparently they're, as you say, they're winning a lot of awards.
[198:52.46]They are winning a lot of these.
[198:58.53]Thank you.
[199:01.81]We want to thank Epic, Hector, Nicole for believing in our vision.
[199:10.15]Crazy vision.
[199:11.33]Crazy vision, yes.
[199:13.15]Direction is nothing without a team to actually build it.
[199:18.82]And huge thanks to Remedy team for joining us on this venture, wanting to believe
[199:27.66]believing it and build it.
[199:31.58]You know, we can pull into different directions and nothing comes out of it.
[199:37.73]But when more than 100 people believe in the same vision and build something out of it, we can make miracles, we can make art, and we can be more than the sum of our parts.
[199:56.15]our world today could use a bit more of that.
[200:00.93]One other thing.
[200:03.04]Next Monday, December 11th, New Game Plus, the final draft is going to be coming out.
[200:08.82]New story content.
[200:10.28]So yeah, go play it.
[200:11.28]Thanks.
[200:12.68]Thank you.
[200:13.34]Thank you, Game Awards.
[200:15.45]I might check that out now.
[200:17.09]I might check out Island Wake 2.
[200:22.29]Is it like the first one?
[200:25.40]I didn't play the first one.
[200:26.88]Oh, you didn't play it?
[200:29.62]Okay.
[200:31.36]But I hear that Alan Wake is canon in the Control universe, and I like Control.
[200:36.70]So... That's my jumping in point.
[200:44.05]When we started building this game, we set a bold vision for ourselves.
[200:48.25]We said that if we're going to make a shooter, it needs to be unique.
[200:51.37]It needs to be something that no one else is doing.
[200:55.05]Standing here today, I'm so proud.
[200:57.38]This game's really good, by the way.
[201:01.12]Yeah.
[201:01.40]Who helped make this crazy dream a reality.
[201:03.38]There's some rumors.
[201:04.18]I don't want to spoil it.
[201:05.18]He's going to announce it.
[201:06.12]All of you are amazing players.
[201:08.32]Get the leaks out of here.
[201:09.38]I want to watch the show.
[201:10.68]Gratifying experience of my entire career.
[201:13.62]You're not just a part of this journey.
[201:15.04]You guide us.
[201:16.00]You inspire us.
[201:17.02]And I love you for that.
[201:19.22]Now, let's watch our latest trailer and keep your eyes peeled for the launch date at the very end.
[201:25.80]It might be sooner than you think.
[201:28.10]Thank you and enjoy.
[201:31.85]Yesterday?
[201:32.45]Shut up.
[201:35.19]I don't know this game's out.
[201:37.17]Wait, was it out yesterday?
[201:40.73]How'd they do that?
[201:41.57]Oh, you know this place.
[201:46.46]this is what it's like you told me to stay out of that hotel was that a slide taking out slot machines by the way so this has this the Ster approval stamp on it right uh
[202:20.78]I'm not going to specify and just say yeah.
[202:22.51]I'm going to simplify it.
[202:23.45]Okay.
[202:31.81]Yeah, I streamed it for like a week.
[202:37.39]And you had a good time playing it?
[202:38.80]I had a great time.
[202:40.46]Can you give me a reason why?
[202:41.72]Because you've played a lot of these kinds of games.
[202:45.20]It has...
[202:46.94]a higher time to kill so there's more time to do fun stuff and I think it embraces for being kind of looking like just an average shooter it has a lot of stuff in it that's really fun that you wouldn't attribute to the visuals and the destruction is like ridiculous that there's no other game that's like touched how much stuff blows up in this game and actually like functionally works in the physics well it's out apparently
[203:19.28]You spoiled that.
[203:20.43]Yeah, but the voice acting is AI, which is why everyone's spamming AIL.
[203:36.32]So if you don't want the Terminator to take over.
[203:40.66]While you're there, collect all the TGA trophies for an XP boost.
[203:44.16]We want to help you unlock those Peter Griffin skins.
[203:46.92]The island code is below.
[203:49.68]Still to come, the presentation of Game of the Year featuring our orchestral salute to the nominees.
[203:57.26]What is even... I mean, I think we've seen them three or four times already.
[204:01.55]Nominees for Game of the Year.
[204:03.67]I think Best Game Direction is always going to... It follows Game of the Year, right?
[204:07.57]Usually.
[204:07.89]Yeah.
[204:16.83]Well, not follow... I mean, just like that... The games that are in Best Direction, a lot of them tend to be in Game of the Year.
[204:22.89]At least a few of them.
[204:29.83]What's the difference?
[204:42.33]Cells in every area of Baldur's Gate 3 pushes player freedom to the limit.
[204:46.26]Baldur's Gate, a towering landmark.
[204:50.78]And that was said by the Guardian.
[204:52.36]So you, I mean, that's a...
[204:54.57]See what I said about Starfield?
[204:56.59]This game lets you kiss aliens.
[204:57.83]10 out of 10, 10 out of 10, 10 out of 10.
[205:00.73]Starfield?
[205:01.28]Look at Starfield.
[205:02.20]Seven.
[205:02.86]It's like, it's okay.
[205:09.26]I just, I just don't know how much I'm, I think I'm coming to terms with the fact that I just don't know how much I like Bethesda games.
[205:16.05]I just, just not really into them, like at all.
[205:17.79]I just am not.
[205:23.42]What was that?
[205:24.14]Bro, hold on a second.
[205:27.13]What is this?
[205:29.79]This looks like people putting wheat into barrels and shit.
[205:35.58]Command your destiny.
[205:36.26]This is Earth?
[205:36.56]I can relate to Earth?
[205:41.68]Bellwright.
[205:43.82]I didn't even get to see!
[205:46.12]I want to see what Bellrite is.
[205:47.51]They didn't give that very much time.
[205:49.03]After the show, check out the TGA post show on Twitch where Google Play will reveal the winner of its Play More award.
[205:57.27]Jeremy, you didn't like Red Dead Redemption?
[205:58.84]Red Dead Redemption 2 is like one of my favorite games ever made.
[206:01.70]What info are you getting from?
[206:04.82]That's right.
[206:05.76]We're getting towards the end of the show.
[206:07.08]And this one, I will let speak for itself.
[206:10.83]Alright.
[206:11.15]Be quiet because this might act.
[206:12.61]Quiet.
[206:37.75]What the hell?

[207:40.14]I think it's amazing.
[207:41.16]I love that game.
[207:42.84]I can't get into the other ones.
[207:44.90]Why?
[207:45.12]Why?
[207:46.78]Why?
[207:46.94]Yeah, no help.
[207:47.78]This is by the world team?
[207:49.06]Okay, that's kind of intriguing.

[208:33.38]It's planned for release in 2025.
[208:35.92]Wow.
[208:36.86]I think everyone wants to know when do they get to see more on this.
[208:41.93]Any sense of when we're going to see more on this game?

[209:16.38]We plan on revealing more information about this game in the summer of 2024, so we hope you keep an eye out for it.
[209:24.56]Also, Capcom is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary.

[209:54.47]Who?
[209:54.57]That's a YouTube name.
[210:07.09]A generation out of date, but... The imagination, passion, and technical brilliance of the six nominees for the Game of the Year were truly inspiring.
[210:15.73]Here with a medley celebrating each of these games, once again, Lorne Balfe and the Game Awards Orchestra.
[210:21.88]Alright, this is one of my favorite parts every year.

[213:38.70]That was a great ad.
[213:48.17]Alright, it's Baldur's Gate 3, right?
[213:50.97]That's essentially what it's going to be.
[214:02.05]And the game of the year is... Presented by Xbox 360?
[214:06.61]Baldur's Gate 3.
[214:11.12]I think that was a joke.
[214:22.63]There it is.
[214:23.19]He came in armor.
[214:32.87]Yep.
[214:33.27]If Vegas odds were probably like.
[214:37.57]If you made that bet, you probably got like 10 cents.
[214:41.74]um I didn't expect it anymore um thank you thank you so much um you didn't expect it a game like baldur's gate 3 isn't possible if you don't have an incredible team humble humble and the team at larian spent their hearts and souls for six years on this game and sometimes very difficult circumstances this was our covert game um
[215:05.80]Along the way, we lost quite a few people also, so we want to dedicate this to all the people we lost, and especially to Jim, our lead cinematic artist who passed away in the last month.
[215:21.62]I want to thank over 2,000 people, so sit back and relax.
[215:26.72]But I also want to thank everybody that supported us throughout this entire effort, our families, our friends, our partners.
[215:37.85]You were the best, and without you, we couldn't have done it.
[215:40.11]Thank you very much.
[215:41.38]Thank you.
[215:43.45]they deserve I mean like I said I've only played maybe like six to ten hours of it so far but you can just tell that there's a lot in there um very clearly they spent a whole lot of fucking time on that they spent a ton of time on this game and the passion project and it shows so of course they deserve it
[216:05.25]When they announced that they were the ones going to be making it, the reception was like actually really negative.
[216:14.65]Really?
[216:15.53]There's no way they're going to be able to.
[216:17.31]There was like every Reddit post was like, there's no way.
[216:19.88]Come on, dude.
[216:21.26]They're going to really fuck.
[216:22.10]This is going to be bad.
[216:23.78]Yeah.
[216:25.82]Huh?
[216:26.92]So congrats.
[216:28.80]Big dub.
[216:30.26]Is that it?
[216:32.57]I think that's it.
[216:34.05]Yeah, man, I'll see you next year.
[216:35.21]Yeah, see you next year.
[216:39.41]That was fun.
[216:43.09]It's still stuck like this.
[216:50.25]This looks like an image.
[216:51.83]This doesn't even look like it's in the current year.
[216:54.67]This looks like it's 25 years old.
[216:59.91]Why does this look like such an old picture?
[217:05.04]Because you have a 240p webcam.
[217:07.52]I don't.
[217:08.49]And you're shocked it's not working.
[217:09.77]No, this is not a 240p webcam.
[217:12.67]Get the VTube avatar.
[217:15.27]You know, I was going to do that for a long time.
[217:19.55]Dude, I hate when you get this close.
[217:20.87]You can see the pixels in your face.
[217:22.17]You know what I mean?
[217:22.67]I hate the HD.
[217:26.40]Look at this fucking turkey chin I've got going on here.
[217:28.82]This is getting a little ridiculous.
[217:32.98]Look at that.
[217:35.62]Geez.
[217:35.94]I have to work on that.
[217:43.57]Anyways, that was fun.
[217:45.23]Did you have a good time watching?
[217:46.35]Alright, so... We said our games of the year.
[217:50.91]What is your... Oh, is that funny?
[217:56.19]My what?
[217:56.75]No, I was just thinking that my game of the year is Q Remastered.
[218:01.15]Your game of the year is Q Remastered.
[218:03.57]Okay, it was great!
[218:06.41]But, you know what?
[218:07.65]I don't think that's a bad choice.
[218:10.70]Everybody has their own thing that they like and their own shit that they're into.
[218:14.64]That does not bother me.
[218:18.92]What were you going to say, though?
[218:20.94]No, no, I was just saying, is there any other things you played this year that you'd like to tell people about?
[218:29.18]Path of Exile New League coming out tomorrow.
[218:33.88]great game that's cool yeah that's that's an interesting happening that that is an interesting thing the finals came out did it come out today or tomorrow good game was fun ai uh ail yeah I don't remember like I said I don't remember half the things I played
[218:51.62]uh I don't either and it's no it really it's like it's I will sit there and think about it and I'll go what did I eat what the did I even watch or play this year I feel like it's dwindling each year nice lego hand thanks dude yeah you got to keep track of when it came out I mean I've been playing Half-Life 1. that's true
[219:20.31]Wait, didn't you say that Half-Life 1 is like the hardest game ever made and people forget about that?
[219:25.99]Oh, it's brutal.
[219:27.29]It's like, not only do they have Dark Souls I Kill You pranks, the AI just instant shoots you.
[219:33.67]It's undodgeable.
[219:35.15]Really?
[219:37.03]I don't remember.
[219:39.09]I don't say it's the hardest.
[219:40.44]I was saying on stream today, if you want to play a hard game, you go back, you play Echo the Dolphin.
[219:44.66]You want a real challenge.
[219:46.82]Well, Lion King for SEGA Genesis.
[219:50.07]Old games you had to start over from the very beginning of the game if you didn't do good enough on the first time you've ever tried to play it.
[219:57.42]Think about that.
[219:59.10]There's no autosave.
[220:00.48]It's just you weren't good enough to beat it.
[220:02.20]You just sat here for the first time ever.
[220:04.34]Fuck you, piece of shit.
[220:06.06]Start the entire game over from the very beginning.
[220:08.62]When your dolphin drowns and sad music and it's like depressing, you better start over.
[220:14.38]Thanks.
[220:19.94]They don't make them like they used to, you know what I mean?
[220:22.00]They used to be so much harder.
[220:22.93]See, everyone makes fun of me for being like, oh, you're a boomer.
[220:25.07]You're so bad at games.
[220:26.63]Yeah, I'm bad at new games.
[220:29.43]You want to go play Home Alone 2 for the NES or the SNES?
[220:33.43]Yeah.
[220:33.95]Good luck avoiding the bird shit on the slippery ice level, bro.
[220:39.30]Have fun with that.
[220:44.14]Wow, boomer.
[220:49.66]You should stream that game.
[220:51.04]Alright, well, see you later.
[221:01.50]You didn't have you didn't name a single game.
[221:04.24]Robo quest came out request was good.
[221:07.50]Name one game.
[221:09.00]I didn't name any name one game that came out this year.
[221:13.21]You don't even have to have played it.
[221:14.43]Just name a game.
[221:15.81]Baldur's Gate three.
[221:18.39]Why did you think I was going to lose this?
[221:19.75]You were so confident I was going to lose this game of yours that you're playing.
[221:22.84]I thought you were going to say Jackie Chan.
[221:24.80]Oh, okay.
[221:31.46]You like Baldur's Gate 3?
[221:34.17]Interesting, Ster.
[221:35.99]Did you play Baldur's Gate 1 or 2?
[221:37.25]I didn't play Baldur's Gate 3.
[221:43.07]Did I tell you?
[221:45.76]Remember the Neverwinter Nights game?
[221:48.94]Also haven't played it.
[221:50.14]Okay, so that got, I mean, people were like, oh, Neverwinter Nights, that's a, you should try it.
[221:54.20]You play it.
[221:54.72]It's like, it kind of, that's how I thought of Baldur's Gate 3 when I first heard about it and at Baldur's Gate in general.
[222:00.93]I played Neverwinter Nights for a total of, I think, 14 to 15 minutes total.
[222:07.37]I made a character and I was very confused.
[222:10.03]And the character they made was, I don't think I even had any moves.
[222:13.60]I was like a singer and my character just, I had a one move on my bar that was me going like: dooo doo do tee tee do do doooo.
[222:21.75]It was a whistle and it like gave people a buff. But I couldn't touch it- I couldn't hurt anybody. I couldn't do anything.
[222:26.75]So I was like why am I playing this?
[222:32.75]Same experience but it was with the Final Fantasy dress spheres.
[222:35.75]I just like didn't get it. Like and you- you have to build a character from the very beginning.
[222:40.75]I was like yeah bard, I'll take the singing spell. Of course I will.
[222:46.75]And then I stopped playing because I was like: This is not fun, I can't do anything. I'm like whistling and other people are playing the game.
[222:51.80]But now I get it.
[222:52.50]Now I understand like the RPG genre.
[222:56.29]I didn't, you know, 20, 30 years ago.
[222:58.71]When did Neverwinter Nights come out?
[222:59.61]Like 10, 12 years ago?
[223:01.59]Probably 40.
[223:05.41]But I get it now.
[223:06.19]I understand it now.
[223:08.63]One of those things - it's you know like when you when you first try a FromSoftware game
[223:12.63]And this might not be to a lot of you younger people that have obviously played them
[223:19.63]But back in the day, Ster do you remember you were playing Dark Souls or Demon's Souls for the first time and going: This game sucks, I'm never playing this again. This is stupid.
[223:28.63]Uh, no, I don't- I don't, because I liked it.
[223:33.72]When I first played Dark Souls, I was like, this is awful.
[223:37.78]Why do people like this?
[223:40.33]I don't get it.
[223:41.91]I'm supposed to be able to hack.
[223:43.03]It's a hack and slasher, man.
[223:45.81]The monster killed me in two hits.
[223:47.75]This game's not fun.
[223:49.93]You have to get it first.
[223:50.69]You have to understand it.
[223:54.07]You play enough games where you don't die that sometimes you want to be stepped on by Gwen.
[224:04.45]Oh, come on.
[224:08.94]You have to get it to understand it.
[224:11.38]Well, you have to get it to jet.
[224:13.94]You have to like really, cause it's like a new kind.
[224:16.74]I know, I know this is going to sound weird to a lot of people, but like 15 years ago...
[224:23.73]The way that Dark Souls and soulslikes play was not really a thing that people were making.
[224:30.73]When Demon's Souls came out- when Demon's Souls came out I don't know about that.
[224:33.73]Do you remember when Demon's Souls came out?
[224:35.73]Demon's Souls was a little different, people made a big deal about it.
[224:39.73]I don't- I don't know, you go back you look at Fable 1, you're- you're dodging rolling, your third person.
[224:43.00]No fucking way dude.
[224:45.00]Demon- Demon's Souls is-
[224:47.00]You got to redo the arena fight with the werewolves.
[224:50.10]Dude, Fable 1 is a cute little bunny compared to Demon's Souls.
[224:55.70]Listen to me.
[224:56.36]Peter Molyneux invented the Souls-likes.
[224:58.93]No, Demon's Souls was... You made one single mistake, you were dead instantly.
[225:03.81]You make a mistake in Fable 1, you get a guy that chimes in and goes, Hey, make sure you heal.
[225:09.01]Do you have any food?
[225:10.51]I'm trying to tell you, remember to heal with the food.
[225:12.12]Do you have any potions of food?
[225:14.10]Are you hungry?
[225:15.72]They helped you a lot in that game.
[225:16.92]They were fucking health potions of food.
[225:22.95]Yeah.
[225:24.11]In Demon's Souls, when I get hit three times by the big, big ass guy running at me.
[225:30.18]I don't nobody tells me to remember to eat.
[225:33.04]Can we take a step back?
[225:34.06]We're just a moment ago, you were saying about how you guys don't know how hard old games were.
[225:38.12]And now you're saying I didn't enjoy Dark Souls because it was too hard.
[225:42.78]No, no, I'm just saying that back when... No, no, you're missing the point.
[225:47.12]It's not connecting.
[225:49.06]I said when Demon's Souls came out, games like that weren't... Number one, they weren't popular.
[225:55.41]And number two, they didn't really exist.
[225:59.49]Fable 1 is not as hard as Demon's Souls.
[226:02.09]Okay, is that the argument?
[226:05.58]Guys, do you think Demon's Souls is as hard as Fable 1?
[226:13.15]No, this is a ludicrous take.
[226:15.89]What about King's Quest?
[226:19.05]That's a point-and-click adventure game.
[226:20.87]No, what's the name of the game?
[226:25.24]Yeah, Fable.
[226:26.44]You can't even compare them.
[226:27.26]They're not even in the same category.
[226:31.90]Demon's Souls is harder.
[226:33.18]Yeah, King's Field.
[226:35.33]Someone said, Fable 1 is a joke of a game with a question mark at the end.
[226:42.22]That's the first game in video game history that makes you care about the dog.
[226:48.24]That's Fable 2.
[226:50.48]You have your franchise wrong.
[226:52.18]That's Fable 2.
[226:53.10]I'm a big Fable fan, so I can fact check your Fable takes.
[226:56.24]I'm a big Fable fan.
[227:01.00]Yeah, maybe.
[227:02.15]Maybe I'm mixed up.
[227:03.61]I'm as big of a Fable fan where I got to the first chest you had to open with followers in Fable 3 and I turned off my PlayStation.
[227:13.51]That's how much of a fan I am.
[227:17.35]That's pretty big.
[227:18.23]I didn't play... I didn't stick around for Fable 3.
[227:22.85]Xbox.
[227:23.29]More than me.
[227:23.81]I got the platform wrong.
[227:31.35]But Demon's Souls was a... Stuff that people weren't used to seeing.
[227:37.78]Roguelikes were not popular.
[227:39.70]Nobody even made them.
[227:41.77]What rogue-like game like that existed?
[227:45.05]No, it'd be like, what do you mean I have to start over if I lose?
[227:47.33]What do you mean I lost all my shit?
[227:49.36]I don't want to play Lion King for the Genesis again.
[227:53.16]A Thief 1 Gothic.
[227:58.78]Literally rogue.
[227:59.72]Yeah, but they weren't, like, in the current gen of games that was there, people weren't playing rogue games.
[228:08.33]during the PlayStation 3 era.
[228:10.13]Come on, Gwyn.
[228:11.35]That's a real stern come on, Gwyn.
[228:13.67]That's how you know I'm fucking annoyed.
[228:22.28]Pac-Man is the first roguelike?
[228:25.32]Yeah, kinda.
[228:28.46]Do you think you could launch the rocket in Factorio?
[228:30.90]I don't think I could launch the game Factorio, so no.
[228:38.05]Have you played?
[228:38.81]That'd be rough.
[228:40.29]I factor is one of those games where I've decided that if I enter the world, I do not like how much time I may spend in it.
[228:48.46]And I want to avoid it.
[228:49.54]Oh, so you're you're avoiding it out of fear of addiction.
[228:56.32]I think it might get me in a way that I will not like.
[229:01.63]Yeah.
[229:04.74]Yeah, I just don't think I'll be able to get through the tutorial.
[229:07.04]So that's my reason.
[229:08.84]Well, they've got simpler ones these days.
[229:11.35]No, dude, I don't know.
[229:16.41]You can play what was it a Lego Batman.
[229:19.95]I need a game with four buttons.
[229:22.57]And then health potions, and I'm good.
[229:26.57]You have up, down, left, right, and health potion.
[229:29.25]Yeah, I'm just saying, you give me directional, you give me attack, dodge, or block, and map.
[229:36.95]And I'm telling you, I will destroy that game.
[229:40.11]You must build a boat.
[229:42.47]That game was actually really fun.
[229:44.62]Yeah, that's a good one.
[229:47.24]It's pretty much one button and a health potion.
[229:50.66]Loved it.
[229:51.62]Do I have a weird memory of you streaming that game?
[229:55.94]I think I did.
[229:56.50]If you guys don't know, let's go over this because this is truly a great experience.
[230:03.60]10 Million is a game.
[230:05.66]You can get it on Steam.
[230:06.60]You can get it on, I think, iOS too.
[230:09.41]Just go get 10 Million.
[230:11.11]The name of the game is 10 Million.
[230:13.03]It's like a match three game.
[230:14.41]Don't...
[230:15.33]do not audibly groan at me please uh it's a great game please for the love of god go get 10 million and start your journey playing through the two games in that series they're just super fun addicting experiences that just it just is what it is you got Ster telling you the same thing and do you guys trust his game opinions more than mine
[230:39.25]Back when me and Jerma were both in middle school and mobile phones had just come out, he told me to try 10 million.
[230:46.36]And by gosh, he was right.
[230:50.10]Yeah.
[230:52.96]I appreciate that, by the way.
[230:54.12]Appreciate the acknowledgement.
[230:59.09]I don't trust either of you.
[231:02.67]Well, I'll get somebody else to say it.
[231:08.04]That was a really authentic testimonial on the side of the website.
[231:17.65]It's a great game though.
[231:18.51]Great franchise.
[231:19.37]Just fun.
[231:26.34]Jerma normal people can't just go get $10 million.
[231:29.28]Oh, alright.
[231:33.46]Alright, Sizzy, just go get $10 million and then come back and talk to me.
[231:36.74]No, yeah, it's called, the name of the game is 10 Million.
[231:42.70]It's not on Steam or the App Store.
[231:46.27]What?
[231:47.57]Really?
[231:49.13]Do I have one of those Steam games that you just can't get anymore?
[231:55.03]Oh, the person's a liar, okay.
[231:57.00]Liar, one guy.
[231:59.97]How many zeros did you put?
[232:01.27]Dude, I don't understand.
[232:04.75]I'm trying to put down 10 million.
[232:06.19]It's like... Dude, there's like 16 zeros.
[232:10.43]Oh, shit.
[232:11.06]Oops.
[232:14.92]I just made fun of that guy for no reason.
[232:20.24]You really... He's never going to forget.
[232:24.69]You have to search the number 10,000,000.
[232:26.19]Someone call it a little gem.
[232:28.18]You always manage to read.
[232:29.02]It's only $2.99.
[232:31.04]It's $3.
[232:31.26]That's it?
[232:31.52]That is at least... What?
[232:49.72]I'm just imagining randomly in the year 2023, almost 2024, the guy who made $10 million looks at his whatever account and is like, why does a bunch of people randomly go buy $10 million?
[233:02.70]It's been like a decade.
[233:03.80]There's a newer game.
[233:08.04]What happened?
[233:08.64]That's true.
[233:11.68]You were right.
[233:12.25]I had to type actual numbers.
[233:13.83]I'm sorry.
[233:15.83]Oh, I feel bad.
[233:23.98]Oh, you were typing M-I-L-L.
[233:26.62]Yeah, that's how, honestly, that's how you should type it.
[233:28.98]Yeah.
[233:30.83]I'm sorry.
[233:31.17]Obviously, you don't name the sequel 10 Million and One.
[233:33.75]You call it You Must Build a Boat.
[233:35.37]That's the proper chronological order of things.
[233:39.53]So we might get a hot take out of you from here.
[233:41.23]10 Million or You Must Build a Boat.
[233:46.07]Which one is better?
[233:47.79]Hmm.
[233:54.38]That's rough.
[233:55.34]Because there's a correct answer for both of these, by the way.
[234:02.20]I feel like we're debating the existence of a very specific first season Seinfeld episode.
[234:08.87]Like, that's how many people are following.
[234:10.85]Like, oh, no, I remember that one.
[234:13.45]I want to say half of my streams.
[234:15.29]Half of my streams are made and designed for like six people to get what the fuck I'm ever saying.
[234:21.98]So that's fine.
[234:23.37]what about the other the other not six people that's alright they'll they'll figure it out eventually I I think I played the the original more this you must know what has more but there's like a classic simplicity to 10 million that's fair yep I would probably agree with that 10 million is just a simple fun experience
[234:53.41]You Must Build a Boat gets a little more involved, I think.
[234:56.79]Nostalgic.
[234:58.73]Both games are on sale and they're a bundle together.
[235:01.22]You should go get it.
[235:02.56]What is it, like $4?
[235:05.34]It's $70.
[235:05.52]Imagine that would be fucking crazy.
[235:12.34]The guy changes it right now.
[235:15.20]He's like, wait a minute, $10 million was 10 years ago.
[235:17.26]Why am I getting like trickling sales in?
[235:20.16]That'd be like buying Diablo 1 in current year.
[235:29.16]you play it right now I I don't know I have to install it I gotta open it it takes a lot a lot to install it's a huge it's 10 million gigs it's probably not even 10 million bytes forget about 10 million gigs this game might be like 16 megabytes
[235:58.02]Cherry vanilla Dr. Pepper?
[236:01.20]Yeah, I would allow that.
[236:05.34]I wouldn't purchase it, but I would drink it.
[236:15.43]Okay.
[236:18.23]That was for literally six people here.
[236:19.81]I just proved the thing that I just told you.
[236:22.77]No, I'm the same.
[236:23.79]There were like three people talking about it.
[236:26.43]That we really are just like talking to like one person.
[236:29.43]Yeah.
[236:30.95]The one person gets it.
[236:33.75]Yeah, I don't care if 10 plus 20 plus thousand people don't understand like anything I'm saying.
[236:39.21]I'm just, I care about like six of you that care and understand.
[236:41.94]Like when I bring up the dog in Zenless Zone, like, you know who you are.
[236:45.36]Yeah.
[236:57.03]I mean, it's not you.
[236:57.73]Hey, I'm really hungover.
[237:01.45]I got drunk and ate a mostly raw chicken sandwich last night.
[237:06.45]That's not what your favorite game of the year was.
[237:10.80]But thanks for the feedback.
[237:16.62]Yeah, so where was Silksong and where was the GTA 6 trailer?
[237:21.94]I mean, the GTA 6 trailer is just... Rockstar just does their own thing over there.
[237:26.16]Yeah, but didn't it leak?
[237:28.45]I thought it was a leak.
[237:29.59]Yeah, but Rockstar just was like, hey, the trailer leaked.
[237:32.17]We don't care.
[237:32.69]We're just going to put it up now.
[237:34.15]So yeah, they addressed it.
[237:35.81]Well, usually even if something leaks, especially like that close to the Game Awards, am I going to have to Google it?
[237:43.90]I'm actually surprised you've not seen the GTA 6 trailer.
[237:46.30]That's kind of, I'm surprised by that.
[237:48.76]I saw it the second it came out.
[237:49.90]I have seen two separate meme, three separate meme versions of it, but not the actual one.
[237:56.54]Oh, did you get caught watching one of the machinimas that were made of people making fake ones?
[238:02.71]I look at what my Discord posts in the meme channel, and then sometimes it's like gachi base as though it were the GTA 6 trailer.
[238:14.43]I don't know, man.
[238:15.73]I imagine people in the GTA kind of video editor probably put together a bunch of fake shit.
[238:27.26]There's two boomers talking.
[238:28.83]No.
[238:30.79]You remember the good old days?
[238:32.07]I do.
[238:35.28]The original Nintendo.
[238:38.80]SimCity 1.
[238:42.61]I remember, uh, what was the name of the game?
[238:44.84]You didn't build buildings.
[238:46.86]They were just squares.
[238:47.86]You need city skylines.
[238:48.84]You need $800 of Yosito.
[238:50.72]For us, it was squares and it was ours on the square for residential.
[238:55.26]Do you remember SimTown?
[238:56.74]The thing that predated all of them with the burger?
[238:59.88]SimTown was weird.
[239:01.50]SimTown was very weird.
[239:02.70]I feel like that's a, that's a game to stream.
[239:04.62]That is just bizarre.
[239:07.72]I don't think it had anything to do with a town.
[239:11.45]I mean, I just, I didn't get it when I was younger because I was like an early teen when it came out.
[239:17.65]Let me see.
[239:18.92]But I just made like the clown hamburger restaurants and shit.
[239:22.78]I didn't even know what the hell I was doing.
[239:24.66]I would... Okay.
[239:26.86]When I was younger, I just never understood the concept of profit, net profit, revenue, and expenses.
[239:35.68]So I'd always look at the financial sheet of whether it was SimCity or any tycoon type game.
[239:41.87]And I just would take the maximum amount of loan you could take from the bank because I just didn't get it.
[239:46.59]was like wait there's just money here I wait I can I can just take out like five hundred thousand dollars they're just gonna give it to me it's like a cheat code I'll take it and I would fail every time because I'd be like what's happening I just remember doing that same thing but then instead of building a city placing the blocks to make a maze and then like that was it it wasn't even a town there were no roads it was just he
[240:13.32]Yeah, it's back in my day when we had real games.
[240:15.96]But they would show the financial screen.
[240:17.42]Easy games like Dark Souls.
[240:19.28]Through the financial screen, everything would be just bright red with a negative symbol next to it.
[240:24.71]I'm just like, I think I'm doing a good job.
[240:27.55]I'm running this park very well.
[240:30.25]What do you mean I'm negative $400,000?
[240:32.11]What are you talking about?
[240:34.77]I just never understood the concept.
[240:37.15]I was like 11.
[240:42.77]They need to teach financial fucking literacy in schools, okay?
[240:47.22]I didn't know anything.
[240:49.18]If you go to another country, you don't got to pay it back.
[240:59.55]They didn't teach you negative numbers at 11?
[241:01.89]No, dude.
[241:04.91]I'm talking about the concept of like net profit for a business is something that an 11-year-old doesn't understand.
[241:18.57]Oh, don't worry, Chad.
[241:19.51]He learned.
[241:20.75]I did.
[241:21.29]You did not know shit about finance when you were 10, okay?
[241:25.46]You were picking your nose and eating it.
[241:26.74]I was playing Crazy Bones.
[241:38.70]I heard that from I just heard I just heard Holly laugh from downstairs.
[241:42.96]That was a good one.
[241:43.96]That's a that's a big long laugh.
[241:46.20]I know that was a good one to travel.
[241:48.40]I can tell sometimes like how good how good funny something could have been.
[241:52.93]Because I'll say something that I think is really funny sometimes and it's just crickets.
[241:56.83]It's just crickets over there.
[241:58.49]It's the same.
[241:59.13]Oh, fuck.
[241:59.73]That's not that wasn't that funny, I guess.
[242:02.82]We need audiences.
[242:04.14]I'm going to I'm going to get an audience.
[242:09.76]audiences.
[242:10.97]Yeah, I'm gonna full old school Mormon.
[242:18.73]Hey, you're blinking and breathing.
[242:20.25]Yep, I plan to.
[242:21.19]Alright, well, that was fun.
[242:31.62]I'm gonna get some dinner.
[242:33.29]I was wondering where this was gonna go.
[242:34.84]I was just letting it go.
[242:36.18]We're just hanging out.
[242:36.94]We were just chilling, talking about stuff.
[242:39.88]We can't do that sometimes.
[242:41.80]We can, but I was, you know, I wasn't gonna pull the plug.
[242:49.58]You should play SimAnt.
[242:51.10]Guys, I don't understand SimAnt now, let alone when I was 10.
[242:54.58]I was gonna bring that up too.
[242:55.48]SimAnt was weird.
[242:59.37]It's a game where you don't actually have to do anything.
[243:02.34]And stuff just kind of happens.
[243:07.18]Yeah, I don't get it.
[243:09.43]I opened it.
[243:09.93]You're just an ant!
[243:13.41]Yeah, but it's one of those old games that has a Windows menu on top.
[243:20.38]You know what I mean by that?
[243:21.32]Where there's like 10 tabs at the top.
[243:26.32]I feel like I'm in a Windows application, not a video game.
[243:30.27]But you want to play SimTown again.
[243:31.63]I don't know.
[243:34.83]It'd be fun to put the Clown Hamburger restaurant down a few times.
[243:46.46]where everything is labeled for you.
[243:48.52]Yeah, but when everything is labeled, when every single possible thing is... I feel the same way about point-and-click adventure games.
[243:54.97]I don't like when it's look at, feel, touch, listen, and you have to actually... No, no, I want... Let me get... Okay, go ahead.
[244:04.69]You don't have to play SimAnt, but you have to play Valorant.
[244:10.14]I'm out.
[244:16.48]I just don't want to play Valorant.
[244:20.52]I just don't.
[244:23.16]All those shooter kind of games that came out in the last five years, I haven't even opened one of them besides Fortnite to get laughed at in a Ludwig event.
[244:32.42]That's the only reason why I played it.
[244:37.00]I just don't.
[244:37.56]I'm not into them at all.
[244:38.62]I cannot get into them at all.
[244:40.39]I just don't care.
[244:50.37]This might be a take that a lot of people don't want to hear.
[244:53.02]Because you might be big fans of these games.
[244:55.08]But I kind of look forward to when BRs are not the thing.
[244:57.54]Because we went through the MOBA five years.
[245:00.50]Now we went through the BR five, six, seven years.
[245:04.20]I want to get out of the BR phase.
[245:06.81]And I am saying this very selfishly because I am terrible at BRs.
[245:11.71]Awful.
[245:12.21]Truly, truly, disgustingly awful.
[245:15.23]I'm always like in the first 20 people that get killed.
[245:18.96]It's always me and the AFKers.
[245:21.94]It's always me and the people that waited and didn't.
[245:24.50]It's all, I know that.
[245:25.94]And it sucks to know that.
[245:30.33]So me, it's not about the games being bad.
[245:32.56]It's that selfishly, I can't participate in a lot of the VR stuff because I just don't like to play them and I'm not very good at them.
[245:39.84]So I look forward to when the VR phase changes into something else.
[245:50.67]Were you any good at MOBAs?
[245:54.17]I played a lot of Smite back in the day.
[245:56.41]I really did.
[246:00.31]I don't think I was ranked good.
[246:02.74]I didn't really care about playing any of that kind of stuff.
[246:06.08]But I played it a lot.
[246:07.12]I played it every day for a pretty long time.
[246:11.40]I've I loved smite I can I can tell you that I would put smite and I know everybody well holy dude really I would put smite on some of my favorite games of all time I would 2014 to like 2017 smite is one of my favorite experiences hanging out and just playing games with people hanging out with friends just messing around q and s parties
[246:39.43]However you feel about how that game is.
[246:41.17]I had a bunch of great fun experiences playing games with friends.
[246:49.78]And that experience was only, it was very unique to Smite, because I wasn't a fan of MOBAs either, because I didn't like the top-down click-to-move, sort of slightly delayed, where it's like I click here, and it takes like a half second, and then they move.
[247:06.30]Oh, that drives me fucking crazy.
[247:07.96]I hate that.
[247:08.92]I feel like I have input delay.
[247:13.15]It appears you've been by yourself in this call for more than three minutes.
[247:18.50]The bandwidth patrol has asked me to disconnect you.
[247:20.88]His stereo is just gone.
[247:22.72]Yo, he left.
[247:23.58]I've just been talking.
[247:24.46]When did he leave?
[247:25.06]Oh, he left because I definitely wasn't even talking to him.
[247:29.80]I just was yapping.
[247:34.44]I've just been completely yapping this whole time.
[247:40.95]Damn.
[247:42.69]He did say he's like, I'm out, right?
[247:44.63]Okay, yeah.
[247:48.55]I guess I never left the call.
[247:49.53]What was I going with that?
[247:56.29]Where was I going?
[247:56.81]What was I just saying?
[247:58.69]Where was I going with that?
[248:07.39]You were going to la-la.
[248:08.69]Oh, yeah, no, of course I was.
[248:09.79]Yeah, that's what I was going to say after that.
[248:11.47]I was going to la-la.
[248:12.13]That's what I meant to say right after that.
[248:16.98]Yeah, Smite, yeah, but I was like, okay, I know where I was going.
[248:20.46]It's not about how good the game is, it's about how much fun the experience is with yourself or with other people.
[248:29.41]That's how I play games.
[248:31.73]I don't care if a game sucks, if a game's not.
[248:34.01]I'm not saying that Smite sucks, I thought it was a great game.
[248:37.13]It just is, I mean, look at all the weird dumb shit that StirEye, StirItalix, you know, Boo, back in the day, we would just play shit and it didn't matter if it was bad.
[248:48.56]It was just fun to play a game.
[248:51.24]And it's kind of funny because this is this is going down to different territory.
[248:55.12]That's kind of interesting to think about, too.
[248:58.30]And this is we're going to real talk for a second.
[249:01.29]It's kind of weird to grow up because I'm like there now and I've been there for the last five to 10 years of like how I truly feel.
[249:10.67]And video games.
[249:13.67]It's like I they keep they just keep coming out.
[249:18.24]more and more and more of them and I just like it it's fun to it's not fun dude it's fun to think about like very interesting to think about how I don't have like a lot of time for big long games that much anymore like I'm growing up a lot I think in the last like 10 years but I it's cool at the same time still too because they're all available
[249:39.88]I talked earlier, Baldur's Gate 3.
[249:42.76]I haven't played it, but I know it's there.
[249:44.38]And when I get some time and I'm like, yeah, I'm going to sit here for 20, 30 fucking hours.
[249:48.29]I'm going to do it.
[249:55.15]You're not even 40?
[249:55.89]Yeah, but I mean, there's been some very... I'm seeing a lot of things change.
[250:06.18]And I think it's the first time I've really noticed.
[250:09.36]Like, wow, things are kind of... Wait, I feel differently about stuff.
[250:13.68]I feel different about, like, entertainment and games and the world.
[250:18.75]I feel like that's really started to bake in in the last, like, three or four years.
[250:22.51]So.
[250:24.63]And this is the first time that's really happened.
[250:30.12]You look like the what?
[250:31.36]I don't even know if that is.
[250:34.80]I'm not even going to say it out loud.
[250:39.18]He's going through puberty.
[250:43.14]Oh, no.
[250:43.74]He hit 30 to 40 hours in life.
[250:48.30]Wow.
[250:50.93]Holy shit.
[250:51.53]That's profound.
[250:56.51]You should write that down.
[250:58.55]Get that.
[250:59.85]Get that as a title for a paper.
[251:04.52]Holy shit.
[251:08.58]That wasn't profound.
[251:09.98]You're just mad that you didn't say it.
[251:12.58]Come on.
[251:22.69]You've been alive for 320,000 hours.
[251:24.05]Yeah, and I was sleeping for like 150,000 of them.
[251:40.58]But yeah, it doesn't mean anything in particular.
[251:42.98]It just, I definitely have hit that point where I'm starting to feel a little bit older.
[251:50.56]And like, oh man, I'm playing every fucking game that comes out and doing all this shit.
[251:55.71]I'm always playing like the next thing that comes out.
[251:57.47]I'm not going to be playing multiplayer shit.
[251:58.73]I'm going to be playing Valorant.
[252:00.25]I don't really do that anymore.
[252:02.19]And this is interesting to think about how that has slowly happened over the last five years.
[252:08.99]But I still, I'm still here.
[252:10.23]I'm still gaming.
[252:11.07]I still enjoy it.
[252:11.75]I still love it.
[252:20.27]I think 40 is the new 30.
[252:21.19]I really do.
[252:26.61]Oh, that's, I just saw the copium emote and yeah, here they come.
[252:30.15]Yes.
[252:30.57]Yep.
[252:31.07]Absolutely.
[252:35.01]Yeah, that's what that was.
[252:36.55]It absolutely was.
[252:43.31]But yeah, let me just end the stream with saying this Grotto Beasts TTS, the unofficial mod is just a mod on the workshop.
[252:53.93]It is free and pointing at it over here.
[252:56.71]I wanted to get in and play it and show it for a little bit, but I was running a little behind today, but I do plan on showing it.
[253:05.76]There's no real time constraint on me showing it though, but in the next week or two.
[253:11.40]But why is it not official?
[253:13.24]It's not an official TTS mod.
[253:15.48]Those exist.
[253:16.87]This is just a workshop mod.
[253:30.99]Yeah, you don't have to buy this as DLC or anything.
[253:34.19]It's just on the workshop.
[253:36.59]And I've said it a couple times, but just make sure people understand.
[253:41.46]This is the digital version that we have been talking about for the last four months or so.
[253:46.84]Five months now.
[253:48.94]Everything is there.
[253:49.98]All the cards are there.
[253:50.72]There's a ton of fun toys.
[253:51.80]Tons of interesting shit to do.
[253:53.02]It's not just a plank of wood with card art imported.
[253:58.07]A lot of time and a lot of work went into this.
[254:00.23]So
[254:01.98]I encourage you to check it out if you're a Grotto Beasts enjoyer.
[254:06.94]If you are new to Grotto Beasts, there's a sale going on right now in the store.
[254:15.55]Everything is 15% to 17%.
[254:17.29]I think 15% to 18% off right now.
[254:19.51]That's packs and the starter kits.
[254:21.91]The inventory is low, but it's still there.
[254:28.38]The store is coming down at the end of the year, though.
[254:33.30]And any future, if there is any future Grotto Beasts stuff, that will be communicated.
[254:40.35]But there is currently no plan.
[254:42.45]There's no plan for... It's not like, oh, hey, right now, we're working on an expansion of cards, physical cards.
[254:49.25]That's not in the plans right now.
[254:53.17]What is in the plans right now is I did say that I wanted to have there to be at least six months.
[255:00.53]of official, uh, like I want to say like some, like at least two or three patches to the TTS with like substantial additions.
[255:19.77]And the designer has said a few times that there are things that he wants to do.
[255:23.55]There's stuff that the art team wants to do for this project.
[255:27.45]So people are ready to start working on it again for the next at least six months.
[255:40.38]When's your next stream in two months?
[255:44.60]I'll be live in like a week or two.
[255:48.83]Maybe even sooner than that.
[255:50.64]Probably sooner than that, I would imagine.
[255:52.98]Like, next week?
[256:05.95]You can do more Lethal Company?
[256:08.25]Yeah, we talked about it.
[256:10.87]I'd want to do it with a small group, though.
[256:12.93]Not a large group.
[256:20.27]Are you going to do a year end stream?
[256:21.83]Yeah, there's been some stuff floating around.
[256:23.49]Also, there is the House Slipper 2 Invitational, which I got to put some work into that.
[256:30.39]I've been kind of busy the last week or so, but I'm really going to put my head down and get that stream really going.
[256:39.09]Because that is going to be very soon.
[256:46.29]House Flipper 2 Invitational for the actual House Flipper 2.
[256:52.35]It's out.
[256:53.13]It'll be out.
[256:56.34]You'll see it when we decide to do it.
[257:04.54]And this one's going to be bigger.
[257:07.40]Bigger and better than ever.
[257:12.06]If you don't know, the House Flipper 2 tools, I believe, are way more substantial than they are in the first game.
[257:20.87]So we'll see.
[257:33.47]What about a regular House Flipper 2 stream?
[257:35.83]Oh, there will be.
[257:36.63]There will be.
[257:37.59]There will be House Flipper 2 streams.
[257:39.19]Don't worry.
[257:49.68]And they will be timely.
[257:51.06]They will be timely how Slipper 2 streams.
[257:54.82]It's not going to be like, hey, the game came out and, you know, three weeks later I play it.
[257:58.76]No.
[257:59.24]It'll be timely.
[258:05.09]But that's it.
[258:06.57]I'll see you guys later.
[258:07.79]Thanks for watching.
[258:11.17]Grotto Beasts is on sale.
[258:14.01]The end of the year sale.
[258:20.17]And then it's coming down.
[258:22.85]And we are going to reassess maybe at some point.
[258:26.37]But I have to be very honest.
[258:28.63]I'll be very upfront.
[258:29.49]And I want to be transparent about it.
[258:32.05]There are no plans at the moment.
[258:35.28]There are no plans for future physical Grotto Beasts products.
[258:41.72]I do want to make sure that's clear.
[258:56.26]Did you TL;DR everything you said over the last 10 minutes?
[259:01.02]I just did.
[259:01.42]I think that I just did that.
[259:09.45]Rewind 10 seconds.
[259:17.41]I also have to post the thing in the Discord too.
[259:21.64]Me talking about the...
[259:25.46]You know, the Voldemort, the Voldemort word.
[259:31.86]I can't say, I don't want to say the Voldemort word.
[259:40.60]It's a, but it's a soft Voldemort word.
[259:46.87]I like that.
[259:52.41]Why do you want Lala so bad?
[259:55.23]Just listen to a clip.
[260:04.36]Yep.
[260:10.80]When I... I think when I stream it, we'll be able to tell, right?
[260:16.20]We should be able to tell when I stream it.
[260:22.98]What's wrong?
[260:24.96]Oh, it glitched out.
[260:26.23]It glitched out.
[260:26.79]What the f- Wait, what do you mean it glitched out?
[260:30.57]What?
[260:33.45]I didn't just pretend to mute and unmute or get muted and like be mid-sentence talking about a stream that's going to be happening?
[260:39.82]No way!
[260:41.60]Yeah, yeah.
[260:49.76]Okay, that person now can hit the X. Get out of here.
[260:53.44]Go.
[260:54.14]Get the fuck out of here.
[260:55.12]Just click the X. I did it.
[260:56.30]Go.
[260:56.94]Go to bed.
[260:58.00]It's late.
[260:59.32]You got a fucking paper due tomorrow.
[261:00.94]You've been sitting in here for three hours asking me to do the la-la voice.
[261:04.92]You have a paper due tomorrow.
[261:17.14]I have two papers due tomorrow.
[261:18.90]Oh, boy.
[261:20.00]I'm not in school anymore.
[261:26.50]Anyway, that was for the six of you that are.
[261:27.96]Alright.
[261:32.72]See you guys later.
[261:34.38]Keep an eye on the sus.
[261:35.58]It's going to be vague for like four or five days, but there's some cool shit happening very soon.
[261:43.42]You'll see.
[261:46.31]Alright.
[261:46.53]See you guys later.
[261:48.57]Take care.
