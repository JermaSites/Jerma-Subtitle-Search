[00:04.99]Hello?
[00:08.11]Hello?
[00:12.05]How are you?
[00:14.25]That's good.
[00:16.29]That's good, good.
[00:17.29]I'm good.
[00:18.55]It's 7.09.
[00:21.07]You're late.
[00:24.01]It's 4.09, actually.
[00:26.29]In my part of the world.
[00:29.09]Also, I... You guys didn't turn your clocks back?
[00:34.93]The second... We have a few daylight savings times.
[00:37.01]You have to go back... You fall back 10 minutes.
[00:41.21]You guys didn't do that?
[00:45.22]You didn't do that?
[00:45.96]I didn't?
[00:46.26]What are you talking about?
[00:49.04]Yeah, it's fall back.
[00:52.70]No, sorry.
[00:53.66]It's simmer down.
[00:56.24]Like simmer down, right?
[00:59.07]By 10 minutes.
[01:02.05]Simmer down.
[01:09.35]Yeah, the summers simmer down.
[01:13.01]That's not funny.
[01:14.21]You need to be funny.
[01:21.24]I got a whole book of jokes, okay?
[01:24.76]The joke- I have a joke book.
[01:28.32]You're not going to find every single thing I say funny.
[01:32.42]If you did, if you thought every single thing I said was funny, I would feel like you were just blowing smoke up my ass.
[01:39.49]You know what I mean?
[01:45.19]You're not going to think everything I say is funny, otherwise you might just be blowing smoke up my ass.
[01:56.78]I have to tell you guys something.
[02:01.12]I had an insane dream.
[02:04.44]Wild.
[02:05.40]This was wild.
[02:08.27]It was an entire television show.
[02:09.79]It was a whole movie.
[02:11.75]It was fucked up.
[02:17.47]I'm going to tell the whole thing.
[02:19.27]I'm going to try to remember it though because the thing about dreams...
[02:22.83]I wrote the whole thing down.
[02:25.35]It's about a full page long.
[02:34.03]You guys are going to think this one's funny because it has a really interesting ending.
[02:40.96]I'm going to give you a warning here.
[02:43.62]It's disgusting.
[02:45.10]It's gross.
[02:46.80]It's really gross.
[02:54.25]But I'll tell... I want to wait till more people... Do I want to wait till more people are here so more people hear this?
[02:59.97]Or do I want less people to hear this?
[03:02.39]So it doesn't... You know, people don't think I'm weird.
[03:04.17]You know what I mean?
[03:05.79]Should I wait for more people or less people?
[03:07.94]But then... I feel like... I'll tell it in a second.
[03:17.26]Let me explain what we're doing.
[03:19.42]Let me give you the kind of lowdown of what's going on today.
[03:23.67]We're going to play a game today called Later Alligator.
[03:28.13]Excuse me, Later Alligator.
[03:31.36]This is a kind of a puzzle slash point and click adventure game with really cute, interesting characters, I guess.
[03:39.06]It seems like, I mean, people have been requesting this for a while.
[03:41.26]It's been requested for like a year.
[03:44.08]It's supposed to be really fun, just like a chill game.
[03:45.96]We're going to play it.
[03:50.13]If I get kind of over it and I'm done with it,
[03:54.29]I'm gonna play a game called Webbed.
[03:59.78]We're probably still gonna play Webbed.
[04:04.26]Webbed is apparently really fun.
[04:08.24]It's time for you to do a lot of voices.
[04:09.58]I think, isn't the... It seems like it's voice acted.
[04:12.22]Is the whole game voice acted?
[04:14.04]I thought so.
[04:19.01]What is better, alligator or crocodile?
[04:20.21]Crocodile.
[04:22.47]It's a different animal.
[04:23.83]Stop doing that.
[04:27.46]Stop doing that.
[04:28.74]Ow, my hand.
[04:29.68]Look what happened.
[04:31.60]I just hit my desk hard.
[04:32.94]What the fuck?
[04:33.62]Are we going to have 15 different Bernie Sanders voices today?
[04:44.35]I don't know.
[04:44.77]Are we?
[04:46.15]Is somebody going to talk like this?
[04:49.01]Is there going to be another character that talks like this?
[04:52.01]There probably will be a few.
[05:02.84]Do you want a barf drinker statue?
[05:10.71]No, but I mean, maybe that sounds like kind of cool, maybe.
[05:15.47]Do you want one of those?
[05:18.25]Do you like axolotls?
[05:19.69]Yeah.
[05:20.67]They're really cute.
[05:29.80]Jerma, please explain the birds and the bees.
[05:31.30]I'm really confused by it.
[05:34.22]Um, they're two animals.
[05:35.90]One of them's an insect.
[05:36.66]The other one's a bird that flies around.
[05:40.82]The bees are literally gonna- That's how humanity ends.
[05:43.60]Okay?
[05:44.32]Okay.
[05:46.48]The bees.
[05:47.58]You want to look into the bees?
[05:49.24]We have issues here with the bees.
[05:50.60]That's how humanity ends.
[05:51.57]There's your birds and the bees.
[05:58.83]Once the bees are gone, we're all dead.
[06:01.19]Don't you get it?
[06:02.31]When the bees are gone, we are all dead.
[06:13.34]Wise words.
[06:19.76]Save the bees.
[06:20.53]What about the mosquitoes?
[06:23.23]Fuck the mosquitoes.
[06:28.71]Insect tier list.
[06:30.14]Okay, do you guys want to hear a tidbit of information here?
[06:34.50]Mosquitoes are all the way below F tier.
[06:36.56]They're the worst insect.
[06:39.45]Mosquitoes were part of the reason why I moved to Nevada.
[06:44.49]I was like, what's a part of the world where I will never see one of those motherfucking mosquitoes ever again?
[06:50.99]Ever.
[06:51.31]I don't even, I don't want to see them ever again.
[06:54.78]Nevada's one of those places where there are just, are no mosquitoes.
[06:57.74]They do not exist.
[07:00.96]I would rather get stung in the mouth by a scorpion than be outside ever again at like 6.30 p.m.
[07:11.63]in Massachusetts.
[07:14.37]and look up and see the swarm of these bugs that just want to suck all your blood out.
[07:21.10]That's kind of extreme.
[07:22.80]It is.
[07:23.68]I hate mosquitoes.
[07:26.28]Having to be out there and... Look, let me show you.
[07:30.32]When you are outside, and there's a place where there's a lot of mosquitoes, but a really humid place, does this remind you?
[07:38.51]Are you aware of this scenario?
[07:41.15]Yeah, so how's school?
[07:44.07]Yeah.
[07:44.71]No, that's cool.
[07:46.56]I think, um... One of the big problems, I think, with the school system... You just graduated?
[07:53.28]Yeah.
[07:54.94]Yep.
[07:57.84]I don't like doing that.
[07:59.04]I don't like fucking doing that.
[08:02.21]I'm so glad I never have to do that again.
[08:03.77]And everybody is doing it.
[08:07.09]Everybody in, like, the group of people outside are all doing it.
[08:11.94]It's not abnormal to see somebody just freak out and like reach elastic style around their back and be like, yeah.
[08:20.71]What time do you guys want to go?
[08:23.20]If we want to get coffee, we probably should go at like six, maybe.
[08:27.58]Maybe, maybe seven.
[08:28.60]It's like, this is normal.
[08:29.82]I don't, I hate it.
[08:31.40]You're a hater.
[08:32.00]Yeah.
[08:33.99]I am.
[08:34.41]I'm a mosquito hater.
[08:43.31]That was based.
[08:44.71]Take a look at this.
[08:51.09]This is Later Alligator.
[08:52.09]Should I talk about my dream now?
[08:59.62]Okay, this dream is fucking crazy.
[09:01.60]Alright, let me start.
[09:02.86]Hold on.
[09:04.40]So I had a dream.
[09:07.35]I would tell you right now, this is disgusting.
[09:09.45]This is a very gross thing that happened.
[09:12.33]Your sideburns are uneven.
[09:13.97]I need a haircut.
[09:15.06]Sometimes when I shave, I don't, I like, I fuck it up, alright?
[09:18.76]Alright, this is actually a lot.
[09:22.60]That's really bad now that I look at it.
[09:24.68]That's like, that's pretty awful.
[09:27.13]It's like so full.
[09:28.07]I don't, but listen, listen, I think it's...
[09:31.08]I think it's because I, like, went to... My hair has a weird growing pattern.
[09:36.47]Is it that bad?
[09:37.17]Alright, it is bad.
[09:39.01]But listen.
[09:40.17]My hair is a lot thinner here.
[09:42.71]Look at how much thicker my hair is here.
[09:45.09]You see?
[09:46.27]It's really... I have really thick hair here.
[09:49.15]And really thin hair here.
[09:50.88]I didn't shave this.
[09:52.60]Look, see?
[09:55.04]See how it's better now?
[09:56.56]Because this kind of thins out.
[09:59.81]You're reusing the sideburns bit.
[10:01.19]No, I just don't care when I shave.
[10:04.77]I, when I go and get my haircut, they get it to where it needs to be.
[10:08.82]I just don't care.
[10:10.16]I shave my face and I go, whatever, that's close enough.
[10:14.54]Whatever, that's close enough.
[10:15.64]I just don't care.
[10:16.38]I don't care.
[10:17.44]Like, this is fine, right?
[10:18.90]When I go get a haircut, they take care of that.
[10:22.41]I don't care.
[10:22.93]I do the same thing.
[10:25.51]I can't be bothered.
[10:26.27]See?
[10:26.75]Some of you get it.
[10:27.71]I know you do.
[10:32.11]Okay, so listen.
[10:34.42]It sticks out.
[10:35.38]It's because I haven't had a haircut.
[10:38.20]They go... And they get rid of it.
[10:43.97]This is not worst hair.
[10:45.85]Stops at worst hair.
[10:47.03]I didn't do anything.
[10:48.88]What the fuck are you talking about?
[10:50.60]My hair looks fine.
[10:51.86]My hair looks like good.
[10:53.70]Look at this.
[10:54.46]It's like smooth.
[10:55.50]It's silky.
[10:56.18]It's been conditioned.
[10:57.40]Just because I have sideburn hair does not make it worst hair.
[11:02.28]I'm not even putting it on a... I'm not even making it a category this year.
[11:04.50]Good luck.
[11:05.88]Looks greasy.
[11:06.72]It's... What do you mean greasy?
[11:07.85]It's... Look at that.
[11:09.45]Could greasy hair do this?
[11:14.45]Nope.
[11:17.84]That's not, how is it worse there?
[11:19.74]You guys are fucked.
[11:21.75]Whatever.
[11:46.12]So I had this dream.
[11:47.64]Okay.
[11:57.51]I had a dream.
[11:59.63]Where I was... Come on.
[12:04.57]So I had this dream.
[12:06.51]This dream's crazy.
[12:07.23]I have to warn everybody here, seriously.
[12:09.31]I'm gonna probably, like, this is gonna gross people out.
[12:13.25]I had this dream.
[12:16.71]Oh, is my mic peaking?
[12:17.81]It's not.
[12:18.77]Fix your settings!
[12:21.27]Fix your settings!
[12:22.89]There's nothing wrong with my mic.
[12:27.78]Okay.
[12:29.44]So... There's enough people here.
[12:32.16]Whatever.
[12:34.34]Just stalling?
[12:34.98]This is... What do you mean stalling?
[12:36.40]Dude, just do stun lock.
[12:38.65]Fine.
[12:44.28]Okay.
[12:45.82]So.
[12:47.09]Here, listen to me.
[12:47.67]This is really important.
[12:48.99]I had this dream where me and Holly were on a road trip.
[12:56.89]This is like two different dreams that were connected for no reason.
[13:01.63]So me and Holly were on a road trip.
[13:03.83]We were like driving somewhere.
[13:06.03]And you know how in dreams a stuff just gets kind of stitched together and you don't really know why.
[13:15.03]Holly and I. Fix your settings!
[13:17.26]I don't care.
[13:18.65]So Holly and I.
[13:20.85]We went on a road trip, and we stopped at, like, a gas station slash, um, a gas station slash, I can hear, I can hear her laughing already.
[13:30.70]I already told her this, by the way.
[13:33.66]And she was disgusted, by the way.
[13:35.70]She was like, this is, this story is fucking disgusting.
[13:38.36]Like, I, I, she, I, she, she's heard the story already.
[13:41.94]So anyways, uh, we go to a gas station, and we pull in, and it's a car wash slash gas station.
[13:50.55]Okay, cool.
[13:51.29]So the idea was, okay, we're gonna get out and, like, they're gonna wash the car and whatever.
[13:54.53]I don't know why we decided to go get a car wash, um, in the middle of a road trip to some friend's house or something.
[14:00.61]So, we get out of the car, and it's like, okay, take the car, sure, whatever, go ahead, go for it, take it and wash it.
[14:06.27]And one of the workers, this guy had, like, a clipboard here.
[14:09.35]And I, like, went to go do something, and Holly was, like, in the, uh, kind of in the business or whatever.
[14:14.63]And this guy, I don't know if he was, like, going to attack Holly...
[14:19.57]like I don't know why the employee was doing this like I come back out I think I was like maybe I I was outside for some reason I come back in the establishment and this guy's like going to like attack Holly so I I I like got in the way and I like pushed the guy and he pushed me back and I like shoved him with the clipboard and his clipboard like hit him in the face and I started fighting this guy I was like punching him in the face and we were fighting just fighting each other
[14:45.23]And the whole time, this car is at the car wash, right?
[14:50.97]So, okay, the car is at the car wash.
[14:54.47]Splash!
[14:55.33]We're gone.
[14:55.71]We're not in the car wash anymore.
[14:56.63]We're outside the car wash.
[14:58.45]I don't know how it's stitched together.
[15:00.33]And we're looking for the car.
[15:03.29]And the whole time Holly and I are like, what the fuck was that guy's problem?
[15:06.77]That guy was a piece of shit.
[15:07.64]Yeah, I kicked his ass.
[15:09.04]I fucking beat him up.
[15:10.36]Whatever, right?
[15:10.88]So I kicked this guy's ass.
[15:12.78]And we're looking around for the car.
[15:14.28]We can't find it.
[15:14.90]We don't know where it is.
[15:17.22]Eventually, we come to the termination after walking around the parking lot four or five different times.
[15:23.97]The car is gone.
[15:24.91]The car's gone.
[15:26.39]Somebody stole the car.
[15:28.51]Okay.
[15:28.97]Somebody stole the car.
[15:30.31]It's just not there anymore.
[15:31.91]So we had to start walking to my friend's house, whatever it was.
[15:37.68]We started walking.
[15:38.26]Who is Holly?
[15:38.78]Holly is my girlfriend.
[15:40.09]So we had to walk.
[15:45.33]As we're walking down the sidewalk or whatever, some guy in a trench coat and these big sunglasses, he was wearing these huge sunglasses, comes up to us.
[15:56.68]He's walking kind of next to us and we're like, what the fuck is going on?
[16:00.02]And this guy walks up to us and he goes, hey, hey, here, here, hey, spray me in the face with this.
[16:06.08]And he hands Holly this aerosol can to spray him in the face.
[16:12.87]So we're just like, I don't, I, oh, I mean, will you leave us alone?
[16:16.45]Just leave us alone.
[16:17.75]So the guy, the guy's sitting there just waiting for Holly to spray him in the face.
[16:23.03]So she holds the nozzle up like this and is like pointing at him and she goes and sprays herself.
[16:30.91]It was, the guy was, it was a prank.
[16:32.73]The guy turned the nozzle the other way and she maced herself in the face.
[16:37.17]And she's like, and I'm like, what the fuck just happened?
[16:41.71]What the fuck?
[16:42.19]And the guy starts laughing.
[16:43.11]So I start fighting the guy.
[16:44.55]I like start, I'm like fucking, I fight this guy.
[16:47.01]I start punching this guy.
[16:47.89]I'm fighting this guy.
[16:49.29]Like I used to fight another person.
[16:50.86]I'm fighting another guy.
[16:53.27]Holly's over like on the sidewalk with like these like welling up in her eyes like I was like pepper I don't know what the fuck it was so I'm fighting this guy and we get to a point where like we're wrestling around like fighting each other and There was a side like a drop-down we were on like a sidewalk and there was a lip and then another sidewalk Maybe like I don't know maybe five feet six feet lower this guy jumps down to like get down to the other sidewalk and
[17:20.29]And I'm looking down at him.

[17:25.05]And I'm like, I'm going to fuck this.
[17:27.13]I know what to do.

[17:40.52]Two of his friends are, like, coming over.

[17:58.65]We are at our destination.
[18:00.53]Right?
[18:00.83]After that happened.
[18:02.15]We get to the destination.
[18:03.63]We're at my friend's house.
[18:06.67]And I really have to go to the bathroom.
[18:08.59]Like, I could have been at this.
[18:10.12]Remember, this is a gross story.
[18:12.04]Number two.
[18:13.40]So the bathroom is like, I remember like this is stitched together in such a weird way.
[18:17.12]I don't know how it's stitched together.
[18:19.18]So we get there.
[18:21.04]I go to their bathroom.
[18:23.32]And their bathroom is a bedroom.
[18:27.49]It's like a bedroom.

[19:21.41]I'm done.
[19:22.72]It's time now.
[19:24.52]I told you this was going to be gross.
[19:25.76]I warned you like five times.
[19:27.70]So like I flushed the toilet, whatever, and everything's fine.
[19:30.46]And I'm like, okay, it's time to clean up, right?
[19:35.32]So I look over at the material that you used to clean up, which is the toilet paper.
[19:39.74]And on this roll next to here, it was like right next to the toilet, the toilet paper roll had this stain on it.
[19:48.74]It was a stain.
[19:49.60]You know what I mean?
[19:51.48]And I was just like, I don't... I don't think so.
[19:54.72]So I kind of rolled it a little bit, and the stain was there still.
[19:58.84]A little bit faded.
[20:00.04]Still there, a little bit faded.
[20:01.34]I'm like, I don't want to use this.
[20:03.04]I'm not using this.
[20:04.59]So I'm like, what the fuck do I do now?
[20:08.69]Oh, I know.
[20:09.79]There, over on the shelf.
[20:11.83]On the shelf in this bedroom bathroom was like a various sizes and shapes...
[20:17.64]different toilet paper rolls.
[20:20.56]Like some of them were kind of halfway undone.
[20:22.64]Some of them were wrapped up in like the hotel wrapping.
[20:26.22]So I'm like, alright, the hotel wrapping over there.
[20:30.77]That's the one.
[20:31.19]It's a fresh one.
[20:31.75]It's brand new, right?
[20:32.51]It's wrapped in like that hotel wrapping.
[20:35.97]So I go out, I start to go up to go to where the toilet paper is.
[20:41.15]But remember, I don't know why dreams are like this.
[20:43.43]Don't ask me why.
[20:44.51]Please don't ask me why.
[20:45.33]I can't describe why this happens.
[20:48.08]I was in the water, up to here, like a fucking jacuzzi.
[20:54.67]And I was like pushing up to get out of like the jacuzzi and like making it so my elbows were like on the bowl and like getting up because that's how I had to get out.
[21:05.63]So I finally get up, I'm soaking wet, and I'm like out of the toilet, and I go over to grab this, like, I'm like, what the fuck am I gonna do?
[21:14.15]So I grab this wrapped toilet paper, fresh toilet paper roll, okay?
[21:18.89]I didn't fall in, I was apparently already in it.
[21:21.44]Dreams don't make any sense.
[21:22.68]I was apparently already in this toilet, and like up to here.
[21:25.86]Remember, this thing was like five feet tall.
[21:29.42]So I get out, I unwrap the new toilet paper,
[21:34.06]And there's a fucking huge stain on it.
[21:36.00]It's a huge stain.
[21:38.24]Again, I was like, this doesn't make any sense.
[21:40.14]Something with the manufacturing of this shit.
[21:41.54]What happened?
[21:42.02]This doesn't make any sense.
[21:43.38]Why is it like this?
[21:44.95]I don't get it.
[21:45.77]What the fuck?
[21:47.39]So I can't use this roll either.
[21:49.31]So I put that down.
[21:51.11]I go over, again, there are tons of, there's like five different rolls on a shelf over here.
[21:56.98]And I grab one of them.
[21:58.34]That's like kind of halfway done.
[22:00.83]But this toilet paper roll was like antique.
[22:03.73]It was falling apart in my hands.
[22:05.77]Like I would unroll it and it was like crumbling out.
[22:07.84]Like as if it was like antique.
[22:10.06]I was like, I can't fucking use this either.
[22:13.58]What the hell's going on?
[22:16.34]So eventually, eventually...
[22:20.24]I get to a roll that I have in my hand and I'm like, this looks pretty good.
[22:24.68]There's nothing on it.
[22:25.32]There's no stains on it.
[22:26.64]It's not like weird crumbling in my hands antique bullshit.
[22:30.01]I start to like get it over to where, remember I had just crawled out of the toilet.
[22:33.43]I get over to where the toilet is and like, it's kind of like oddly heavy.
[22:38.43]So I, the toilet paper roll kind of unrolls a little bit and then it unravels and hits the ground and starts rolling on the ground.
[22:46.26]And there is rolled up in the toilet paper like 30 to 40 thousand fucking dollars.
[22:54.13]It was where this person was like hiding money in their house.
[22:58.33]It was like they were hiding money here.
[23:00.61]Hiding it.
[23:00.97]I was like, oh my God, no.
[23:03.89]What the fuck?
[23:04.45]There was like a hidden money spot in your house?
[23:06.91]What the fuck?
[23:07.86]So I tried to, and then this is all this money.
[23:10.14]There was like other like little antique shit in here, right?
[23:12.96]There was like little antiques in it.
[23:14.12]There was like little trinkets like wrapped up in the money that was wrapped in the toilet paper.
[23:19.03]So, I start picking up these, like, this bundle of, like, this rolled up money.
[23:23.79]It was, like, rolled like this.
[23:25.57]And I don't know what to do with it.
[23:26.75]Because no matter what I did, this was going to, I would never make it look the same way, right?
[23:32.86]Like, holy shit, man, this was wrapped up so perfectly.
[23:35.48]It's going to be a mess.
[23:36.24]They're going to know that I did that, right?
[23:38.24]They're going to know that something happened.
[23:40.48]So, this is one.
[23:43.20]This dream is your internal struggle with money and greed.
[23:47.18]Well, I'm not done.
[23:47.96]It gets worse.
[23:49.44]So, eventually, like, this unwrapped money, I, like, put it back on the shelf.
[23:53.68]It's all fucking crumpled up and all fucked up looking.
[23:56.05]So, there's no way I did this.
[23:57.61]No way I didn't touch it, okay?
[24:00.21]Finally, I get a piece of toilet paper, like, a roll that is fine and it works.
[24:06.10]I bring it over and I realize that there's a gigantic window.
[24:13.79]directly across from the fucking toilet.
[24:16.47]Like a huge bay window.
[24:19.23]And I was like, what?
[24:21.83]What the fuck?
[24:22.87]Somebody could have seen this.
[24:23.97]What the, somebody could have seen me walking around like this?
[24:26.25]And like, who's, did anybody see, why would you have a window like this?
[24:29.17]Why would you have a huge bay window here?
[24:30.51]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[24:31.51]What is, what's fucking wrong with you?
[24:33.49]So boom, I wake up.
[24:35.17]I wake up.
[24:36.81]And I'm lying in bed.
[24:38.55]And I open my eyes.
[24:39.67]And after this insane dream,
[24:42.70]I thought I shit my pants.
[24:43.68]I thought there was shit in my asshole, in my ass cheeks.
[24:47.18]So I'm sitting there going, I shit my pants.
[24:48.96]Like, there's shit in my ass.
[24:50.66]So, this is in real life.
[24:52.76]Like, I'm lying there in real life.
[24:54.60]Going like, yeah, there's shit here.
[24:58.48]I felt it.
[24:59.10]I knew it.
[24:59.72]I was certain about it.
[25:00.88]So I get out of bed.
[25:01.76]And I like waddle over, like slowly.
[25:05.61]This is the slowest I've ever gotten out of bed.
[25:07.73]And I walk over towards the bathroom.
[25:10.72]And I go to get the toilet paper.
[25:13.44]And guess what?
[25:17.07]There ain't no toilet paper in there.
[25:21.17]So I waddle across the fucking house.
[25:25.14]Just like, god damn it, no, it can't be real.
[25:27.74]And I waddle across the fucking house.
[25:29.74]And I go to where the toilet paper is.
[25:32.34]and I get into a private place and I like do what I need to do and I wipe my ass and it's clean.
[25:39.16]There's nothing there.
[25:40.76]There's absolutely nothing there.
[25:45.65]It was fucking nothing happened.
[25:47.95]And this probably, I probably, I probably like slowly walked around the house like I had shit in my pants for like probably five minutes.
[25:53.73]Maybe like two, you know what, no, that's a lie.
[25:56.77]Maybe like two or three minutes total.
[25:59.37]But still, that's like so long.
[26:03.62]And then I left, and I was like, well, that was fucking wild.
[26:06.28]And I had a wicked bad headache.
[26:10.68]I had a wicked bad headache, and I kind of still do.
[26:13.54]I don't know, man.
[26:14.10]Like, I just have these dreams that just become so fucking strange.
[26:17.60]And that was it.
[26:18.08]And I was like, oh, that was like ridiculous.
[26:23.65]And I wrote this all down too, I remember... Holly was like out here, in her office working.
[26:31.19]And I was just like... It was like wicked early in the morning.
[26:34.94]She was up working.
[26:36.40]And I was just like... I like walked kind of by her and I was like, hey, hi.
[26:41.62]Like I probably looked like I'd get fucked up.
[26:46.93]And she can literally attest to this.
[26:48.71]Like, this is real.
[26:50.17]I was, like, slowly walking by.
[26:52.77]Just like, hey.
[26:54.81]Hey.
[26:55.85]I'm just, like, getting up.
[26:57.37]It was fucking wild.
[26:58.23]And I had to write this whole thing down.
[27:06.14]I thought I shit the bed.
[27:07.38]Because I thought, like, oh my god.
[27:09.98]Okay, I gotta be careful because I don't, I, like, in my brain, I was going over every single scenario, like,
[27:16.45]I hope... Don't come in... Don't... Do not come into the bedroom.
[27:19.92]Do not go in the bedroom.
[27:21.50]Because, like, I may have shit the bed.
[27:22.72]Like, but how do you say that to somebody?
[27:25.30]Oh, hey, um... Hey, I just, like, woke up and I'm, like, kind of a daze, but I may have shit the bed.
[27:30.75]Don't go in there.
[27:37.11]Somebody said TMI.
[27:38.29]I told you, I warned you over and over again.
[27:41.11]This is a gross story.
[27:42.96]This is not, this didn't happen.
[27:44.30]This is not a real story.
[27:45.12]Let me be, look, that didn't happen.
[27:47.42]This was in the dream.
[27:49.60]This music.
[27:53.10]This music should not have been on this whole time.
[27:59.13]Okay, I don't know what it is about, why our brains do this weird shit to us.
[28:05.59]But when I woke up from that dream, I shit my pants.
[28:11.10]Like, I did.
[28:12.08]I felt it.
[28:13.20]You know what I mean?
[28:14.22]Like, it was like, oh, no, no, no, this is bad.
[28:16.98]This really happened.
[28:19.10]I really thought it happened.
[28:20.28]I actually really did.
[28:23.95]But why?
[28:24.72]Why does my brain want to do that?
[28:26.42]Why does my brain feel like, oh, hey, by the way, I need to tell you something.
[28:30.18]Like, you really did that.
[28:31.70]But, like, the first minute that you're up, I'm sitting there.
[28:34.08]I was lying on my back.
[28:35.40]I'm lying on my back just going, oh, no.
[28:41.55]Oh, no.
[28:42.29]This is not good.
[28:42.99]What do I do about this?
[28:43.95]What am I supposed to do about this?
[28:46.23]It was, like, so much internal panic, like, through that entire, like, I don't know.
[28:49.92]I fought, like, two or three people.
[28:52.96]I thought I shit my pants?
[28:55.46]Did you stop doing DMT?
[28:56.59]I don't- I don't do anything!
[29:03.97]Anyways, we're gonna play Later Alligator.
[29:08.82]And the fact that I was in the toilet!
[29:11.60]Why was I in the water?
[29:17.01]Okay, I know that, like, people have, like, dream journals, and people are like, oh, this is why you had that dream.
[29:21.17]I don't, okay, if I told, like, somebody that was, like, a dream journal specialist or whatever that dream, they probably would be like, you made that up.
[29:27.89]Like, that doesn't happen.
[29:29.49]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you.
[29:30.79]I have no idea what's wrong with you.
[29:36.04]This game is, okay, here we go.
[29:41.00]Release the Armin audition tape.
[29:45.74]That's what Holly just said.
[29:51.40]I'm not doing that.
[29:52.44]Not right now.
[29:53.67]I'll do that before, like, I retire.
[30:02.53]And remember, this is important, too.
[30:04.47]I know that, like, sure, me and Holly have a great relationship, right?
[30:07.28]And, like, it's very wonderful.
[30:09.12]It's a great relationship.
[30:10.30]It's fantastic.
[30:12.02]But, like, it... I... I don't want to... I still, like, don't want to, like, fart loud in front of her.
[30:18.92]So the prospect of...
[30:21.05]And they have shit the bed, honey.
[30:23.39]It's like, whoa!
[30:25.04]You went from like, you are farting in front of your girlfriend to you shit the bed.
[30:31.10]That's too hot.
[30:32.00]That's way too much.
[30:33.22]That's too fast.
[30:33.94]We've got to slow that down, right?
[30:35.66]You've got to slow way that.
[30:36.92]Slow way down.
[30:38.39]What's an alligator?
[30:39.53]It's a dinosaur that made it through the meteor, okay?
[30:42.59]Here we go.
[30:43.03]You guys ready?
[30:47.61]Ready?
[30:52.86]So this is Later Alligator, it's a puzzle game, and we're gonna have a great time playing it.
[30:56.86]You and I. No company, please, thank you.
[31:02.14]Okay.
[31:05.40]Latte machine.
[31:07.05]Two earbuds, I thought about it.
[31:10.71]No, um, no hablo ingles, no hablo espanol, no hablos at all.
[31:15.69]Not even one hablo.
[31:18.03]What's going on here?
[31:21.35]48 puzzles!
[31:22.67]Do I have a knife?
[31:27.45]There's no voice acting?
[31:28.37]I think there is.
[31:29.39]They said there's a voice volume indicator.
[31:33.58]Hey, I'm trying to lay low here, so maybe can you move on please?
[31:37.23]Okay?
[31:38.07]Okay?
[31:39.01]You got me.
[31:39.85]I'll come clean.
[31:41.57]Sorry for being so rude before.
[31:42.53]I'm just a little... Well, I'm turning the camera off for this.
[31:44.80]I'm just a little on edge.
[31:46.76]Normally, I wouldn't tell anyone this, but you've got such soulful eyes that I can totally see the eternity of.
[31:53.50]So I feel safe with you, stranger.
[31:55.72]You see, usually I love coming to John Johnny's on my birthday like this.
[32:00.95]Staying in the hotel, floating in the pool.
[32:03.93]Eating two bagels at the continental breakfast.
[32:05.67]Eating two soaps in the complimentary bath basket.
[32:07.93]Ooh.
[32:09.01]Why'd I say ooh?
[32:10.17]Ugh.
[32:11.73]I just burped.
[32:12.51]But this year, I've got a problem.
[32:14.59]A real problem.
[32:16.13]A real, real, big problem.
[32:19.23]The thing is, I'm pretty sure the family is finally trying to rub me out for squealing.
[32:23.66]I didn't mean to squeal, honest.
[32:25.46]I just see a pair of earnest eyes and the secrets just start flowing out of my snoot.
[32:29.20]See?
[32:30.22]I'm doing it right now.
[32:32.90]Oh, cheese and crackers.
[32:34.82]What am I going to do?
[32:36.36]I don't want to be rubbed out.
[32:38.54]Two-ton Tony even told me I have to meet him upstairs here at H-Sharp for the event.
[32:43.59]They think I don't know, but I heard him talking to Big Mama on the phone.
[32:47.75]Oh, family's going to come to really show me how it's done.
[32:50.19]What am I going to do?
[32:51.59]I don't want to sleep with the fishes.
[32:53.01]I have shellfish allergy, and I have my asthma accent when I get too waterlogged.
[32:57.01]Wait a second.
[32:58.27]You're interested in me, right?
[32:59.99]You wanted to sit with me for breakfast and everything.
[33:01.52]Do you think that you could help me?
[33:03.30]Since we're such great pals, you could go out and talk to my family around Alligator New York City.
[33:10.70]Find out information about the event and report back to me.
[33:13.64]Yes, that's a great idea.
[33:15.26]Together, maybe we can collect enough info to save me.
[33:19.20]You want to save me, right?
[33:20.94]Right?
[33:22.04]Great.
[33:22.70]I'll text you if I need any help.
[33:24.78]How about you go there and start.
[33:26.26]Do you have a watch?
[33:29.64]Oh, you do?
[33:30.12]Great.
[33:32.12]I'll text a little before 10 a.m.
[33:33.58]since it can take 15 minutes or so to get back here on the trolley.
[33:37.47]Make sure you check your watch a bunch.
[33:39.69]If you happen to get stuck doing some weird game-like activities while investigating, it could take time.
[33:45.03]I don't have, because I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to, I'm going to have a murder done on me.
[33:51.79]I'm okay.
[33:52.67]Look at the beach.
[33:53.17]Pat, remember what Dr. Dooples knew, don't you?
[33:56.45]Anyways.
[33:57.71]Thank you for helping me out like an alligator.
[33:59.27]I feel like I'm better just looking at your super kind, invincible face.
[34:03.54]And be careful out there.
[34:05.12]The last thing we need is two people sleeping with the fishes.
[34:09.08]We need to find a double bed in this economy.
[34:12.20]See you later, friend.
[34:13.42]Stay safe.
[34:19.89]Ah, came off.
[34:22.74]Hello esteemed guest.
[34:24.59]If you're looking to leave the restaurant, you'll have to use the exit arrow up in the corner of the screen.
[34:30.97]We provide all our patrons with an exit arrow and complimentary pillow mints.
[34:35.93]Feel free to use both outside of our fine establishment to exit and munch as you wish.
[34:40.70]Just don't mix the two up, since that arrow is vintage.
[34:44.10]And known to contain harmful materials such as lead paint, asbestos, and a combination of rat poisons and cilantro.
[34:50.44]Please feel free to visit us again here at John Johnny's and have a Johnny of a day.
[34:56.46]What?
[34:58.79]Stop.
[35:00.39]Okay.
[35:01.47]This is cute.
[35:03.35]This is John Johnny's Cafe.
[35:05.60]New voice unlocked.
[35:07.24]Cilantro.
[35:08.08]Ew, cilantro tastes like soap!
[35:10.26]Shut up.
[35:14.08]It is gross, though.
[35:16.62]I love it.
[35:21.02]Hey, bub.
[35:21.78]Got a minute?
[35:22.84]Or perhaps three minutes?
[35:24.46]High and above asking for five.
[35:27.50]I saw you walking out of John Johnny's over there, and I says to myself, Mickey, you gotta talk to that mysterious stranger.
[35:34.30]Vision in pinstripe says, I ain't trying to fluff you up or nothing, but you look like an alligator of exceptional taste, as well as one who might like to dabble in high stakes games of chance and intrigue, if you feel me.
[35:46.98]Oh, don't actually feel me.
[35:47.88]I got a skin condition.
[35:49.58]They call me slick for a reason.
[35:51.27]According to my doc, it ain't going away unless I start using that topical cream at night.
[35:56.41]I gotta listen to some jabroni with a smarty certificate, you know what I'm saying?
[36:00.69]All my smarts come from the street.
[36:02.73]Which is also where I got this skin condition.
[36:05.09]And my impolite lower back tattoo.
[36:08.95]Poom?
[36:10.49]What about the event?
[36:13.59]Oh!
[36:14.44]How about the event?
[36:15.88]I look well here, pup.
[36:17.26]It's a real secret affair, you dig?
[36:18.98]Ain't nobody supposed to be going and telling Pat about it.
[36:21.86]My lips are sealed, just like they seal when I wake up after a night of nose-only breathing.
[36:28.27]Hey, who's Pat?
[36:30.28]You talking about Pat the Alligator?
[36:31.54]Yeah, I know that dude pretty well.
[36:34.32]You see, yeah, he's my second cousin.
[36:36.87]One time when we was kids, us guys got locked out of CCD after recess and missed juice and cookie time.
[36:44.47]We only had one granola bar between us and good old Pat gave me the bigger half.
[36:48.97]I'll always remember that.
[36:52.00]No, I ain't crying.
[36:53.78]I just spit in my own eyes as a display of my street toughness.
[37:02.26]And his pants fell down.
[37:04.38]And he fell down.
[37:05.14]Into an open manhole.
[37:17.15]But I have it on good authority from the paramedics that he only called three of five other people that.
[37:22.17]So, by the way, the old card king at your service.
[37:28.51]Maybe though, just maybe, if you play a little game with Mickey here, my lips might loosen up a little.
[37:34.69]You can keep an eye on this flurry of fingies and find a queen.
[37:39.09]Yeah.
[37:39.67]Alright, keep an eye.
[37:42.03]Three card Mickey.
[37:43.27]Yes, let's do it.
[37:45.89]Mickey's running a street scam.
[37:47.29]Keep an eye on the queen and pick the correct card to foil his plans.
[37:49.87]Alright, keep an eye on the queen.
[37:56.37]Alright, get your peepers peeled because these hands are about to become a hurricane.
[38:01.31]I can't voice act on camera.
[38:02.48]I have to do it behind the scenes.
[38:05.06]See here?
[38:06.24]Keep your eyes on the lady.
[38:08.40]Where's she gonna go?
[38:09.36]Where's she gonna go?
[38:17.29]I got it.
[38:18.55]It was easy.
[38:21.95]Oh, Butto, don't be feeling too bad.
[38:23.31]Ain't nobody can... What?
[38:24.75]Wait, what happened?
[38:25.78]Was I not even looking?
[38:26.88]Ain't nobody can hold a candle to Mickey's slick hands.
[38:30.74]They'd catch fire from the mystery grease.
[38:34.70]Maybe I should start using that cream.
[38:37.78]I wasn't even looking.
[38:38.44]I actually... I actually wasn't even looking.
[38:45.29]I was looking over here at you guys in the chat.
[38:48.72]I'll give you the win.
[38:49.48]Mickey ain't made of stone.
[38:51.70]He's made of a series of tubes filled with a mysterious substance that may or may not be slightly corrosive.
[38:59.15]What?
[39:00.71]I won?
[39:05.15]I did it.
[39:08.63]Oh, geez.
[39:09.39]Anyway, it's about the event.
[39:13.63]Well, yeah.
[39:15.55]Ain't heard it from me, but I hear it's going to be a real affair to remember.
[39:19.86]The whole family's been talking about it for months.
[39:22.18]That's really going to get here, Zeb.
[39:23.94]You know what I'm saying.
[39:25.76]Anyways, thanks for playing.
[39:26.72]Let me know if you need any of my city smarts while you're out here, rookie.
[39:31.15]Try not to lick any trolley handrails, if you can help me.
[39:35.75]Those dermatology co-pays are a real kick in the alligator pants.
[39:39.29]You feel me?
[39:40.99]Oh.
[39:44.14]That was fun.
[39:44.84]I did it.
[39:46.87]Trolley ain't here yet, so why don't you go check out the arcade?
[39:49.91]I think he got banned for his slick fingers gumming up the machines and causing an epidermis epidemic.
[39:56.34]That ain't mean!
[39:57.32]You gotta suffer the same fate.
[39:58.64]Oh!
[40:00.74]Say Goku.
[40:02.36]Oh.
[40:04.98]That was cute.
[40:06.96]Okay.
[40:07.99]Click and drag.
[40:08.73]Up and down.
[40:09.33]Oh!
[40:09.57]Alright.
[40:12.27]Where should I go from here?
[40:13.09]The arcade?
[40:13.63]Okay.
[40:14.84]What time is it?
[40:16.30]It's 8.30.
[40:16.66]What animal am I?
[40:18.25]Oh, I'm an alligator.
[40:19.17]I'm an alligator.
[40:20.75]Alright, where's the arcade?
[40:25.67]Let's go.
[40:31.35]Who is it?
[40:32.61]Um, hello?
[40:34.71]Is this by chance your first time in Alligator New York City?
[40:37.93]I mean, in the city city, not Alligator Long Island or something.
[40:43.52]Who's this?
[40:44.78]I thought so.
[40:45.98]Oh, uh, you don't know me.
[40:47.58]I'm sorry if that's weird.
[40:48.82]I just thought if you'd like, I could text you some tips.
[40:53.52]The city is really big and has a lot of colorful secrets that I wouldn't want you to miss on your first visit.
[40:58.18]Is it okay if I help you out from time to time?
[41:01.69]Lose this number.
[41:04.73]Leave me the fuck alone.
[41:07.57]Ah, great.
[41:08.93]I'll be sure to text you again soon.
[41:10.07]Don't forget to enjoy yourself.
[41:12.89]Okay.
[41:16.67]Oh, what's this?
[41:18.39]Street Fighter 2?
[41:19.25]Do I have to play these?
[41:22.17]I just got a puzzle piece.
[41:23.11]What's that?
[41:26.58]I got it.
[41:27.36]Alright, let's go.
[41:32.60]Sweet Geraldine.
[41:35.10]Hey up there, long arms.
[41:36.28]I'll be back.
[41:38.12]Hey up there, long arms.
[41:38.93]You got a sec?
[41:40.87]Nice suit.
[41:42.15]What's a fancy reptile like you doing at the back of the arcade?
[41:45.37]I know what you're after.
[41:46.09]That's right.
[41:47.18]I've got you pegged just by looking at you.
[41:50.12]You want cold, hard plush.
[41:52.28]Well, you find the right alligator.
[41:54.00]And I've got a job that'll pay for both of our retirements and poorly made stuffies.
[41:59.21]You might see a humble claw machine, but this is a vault, and we're going to break in.
[42:03.57]We can't just walk in.
[42:04.35]No, there's countermeasures.
[42:06.07]Sometimes, normally, the security guard comes by and says, I'm not allowed to put my con chair into the aisle.
[42:12.34]Without the boost, I'm not telling enough work to claw.
[42:14.92]He says it's a fire hazard, but most of the machines in here are.
[42:18.60]You see behind here?
[42:19.52]That's one ailing power strip juicing up every one of these babies.
[42:24.51]One wrong move and pinball and boom!
[42:26.65]This place lights up like my chemistry teacher's hair when I turn that Bunsen burner too high.
[42:30.61]What?
[42:32.45]What the fuck?
[42:33.67]What do you know about the event?
[42:38.71]I'd love to tell you about the event.
[42:39.91]I really would.
[42:40.53]But this is our first time on the job together, Mac.
[42:43.28]You haven't yet earned my unbridled trust.
[42:47.20]Okay, what about Pat?
[42:49.19]Pat is a patsy.
[42:50.59]But not my patsy, that's for sure.
[42:52.31]He's related to some of my dad's friends.
[42:55.06]One time, at dad's show, Pat pulled the fire alarm because he thought someone was trying to set him on fire.
[43:00.54]Turns out he just had a warm piece of pizza in his pocket.
[43:03.42]No one could find him for almost an hour until the firefighters pulled him out of the concert hall's crawlspace.
[43:10.20]He was covered in spiders and had eaten the pizza but was otherwise unharmed physically anyway.
[43:15.93]That guy's pretty weird.
[43:20.19]That was fun voice acting for like five minutes.
[43:21.91]Alright, let's just go.
[43:24.11]Me, I'm known around these parts as Sweet Geraldine, criminal mastermind of the claw machine.
[43:27.55]You haven't heard of me?
[43:28.87]Honestly, I'm not surprised.
[43:31.29]I leave no fingerprints and Johnny Law doesn't have a clue.
[43:34.33]Or Johnny Boyer from my geography class.
[43:37.90]At least that's what he said when I asked him to spring fling.
[43:40.66]Okay, so what do we have to do?
[43:44.16]Maybe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
[43:47.42]claw machine.
[43:47.78]It's a two-man operation.
[43:49.04]I need someone who's not going to rat me out for additional prizes when plush comes to shove.
[43:52.76]You feel me?
[43:54.50]Low effort streamer.
[44:03.31]What do you say, old timer?
[44:04.61]One last claw machine score.
[44:05.93]The big one.
[44:08.93]Alright, let's go.
[44:10.06]Let's do it.
[44:16.50]Follow sweet Geraldine's instructions to get the perfect claw machine prize.

[44:23.06]When you're ready to grab, click the center button.
[44:24.96]What?
[44:26.89]Click left and center button?
[44:27.95]What do you mean?

[45:12.18]I want this.
[45:18.25]Got it.
[45:19.89]I heard a prize.
[45:20.53]Let's check the slot.
[45:22.47]Oh, my dad says I'm not supposed to have too much candy because I get hyperactive and prone to fits of father pinching.
[45:28.25]But I think he just likes keeping it all for himself.
[45:31.55]Alright.
[45:32.33]I got it first try.
[45:34.57]I got it.
[45:36.77]Real job begins.
[45:37.47]How will you react when the pressure's on?
[45:39.26]This time you follow my lead.
[45:40.92]And give me that seashell.
[45:41.84]I think it's pretty.
[45:44.82]What seashell?
[45:45.82]Oh.
[45:46.18]Which one?
[45:46.58]There's two.
[45:46.90]There's three.
[45:52.52]They're all the same, right?
[45:53.30]A little bit more.
[45:59.10]That'll get it.
[46:04.05]That should be good.
[46:04.47]Got it.
[46:05.01]You got one!
[46:06.75]What is it?
[46:07.07]I wonder if I'll hear the ocean if I put this to my ear.
[46:10.40]It said, Glacial melt is changing ocean currents.
[46:15.62]Whoa, dude.
[46:22.84]You're really good at this, but it's finally time for the big score.
[46:25.52]I can see it in your eyes.
[46:26.36]You're ready to get the ultimate prize.
[46:29.98]Get me the doll from the best, most awesome video game franchise of all time, Final Friend City.
[46:36.05]He's the dreamy one with the spiky hair.
[46:37.71]This is it, the big one.
[46:43.41]Which one?
[46:47.85]This one here?
[46:48.33]This one?
[46:53.49]Can't move it.
[46:53.89]It's gotta be that one, right?
[46:57.75]Nah, I'm not gonna be able to get that one.
[46:59.76]We gotta go for this one.
[47:05.50]Stop moving, stop.
[47:08.74]Is it a puzzle piece?
[47:11.60]Where?
[47:13.72]Oh shit, there it is!
[47:14.54]Alright, gimme that.
[47:26.38]The Onimon anime is a bazillion years old and only weird grown-ups remember it.
[47:31.44]I bet you'd only get the reference of it being here at all if you were totally an old person.
[47:37.38]I want that puzzle piece.
[47:39.82]Get me the doll from the best, most awesome video game franchise.
[47:46.73]I think I screwed it all up.
[47:48.05]I don't think I can get it.
[47:48.89]I have to clear this out, right?
[47:58.71]Piter Man, you know, from that obscure internet cartoon.
[48:04.01]Popcorn?
[48:04.43]Bloopalit, maybe.
[48:07.00]I'm Bahman, I'm Piter Man.
[48:11.36]Here's another quarter.
[48:11.96]Could you try again, please?
[48:14.26]I want the puzzle piece.
[48:15.04]Wait, I gotta make sure I can get it first try.
[48:16.36]I might be able to get it here.
[48:21.96]Batman Piter Man.
[48:28.19]Do I go straight down through here?
[48:29.45]Through the middle?
[48:29.93]I think I'll get it.
[48:30.85]That's it, right?
[48:37.17]Wow.
[48:38.05]Dirt.
[48:39.95]Wait, did we put dirt in there?
[48:44.12]I only have two more chances.
[48:45.02]I think I might be out of luck here.
[48:51.56]I have to make sure I can get this one.
[48:52.66]Let me try to...
[48:59.53]Alright, I got it.
[49:03.27]What?
[49:03.53]Did you get the- Oh no, I didn't.
[49:06.26]Yikes, even looking at this guy is like walking under a bazillion ladders or yeeting a shattered mirror into hyperspace.
[49:13.82]I don't- Wait, I can get this one over here.
[49:16.53]This one over here.
[49:17.03]I got it.
[49:21.57]Can the claw go that far though?
[49:22.93]I don't think it can.
[49:23.79]I think I just lost.
[49:29.65]Oh, I got it!
[49:30.19]I got the puzzle!
[49:33.94]You can have this.
[49:34.60]I get the feeling it'll come in handy later.
[49:35.98]I got it.
[49:39.18]That's a Nintendo Switch sound!
[49:43.14]Bad news, old timer.
[49:43.94]That was my very last quarter.
[49:50.29]I'll retry in 30 minutes!
[49:53.59]Oh, it makes... I thought it was timed out.
[49:55.75]Okay.
[49:57.17]30 minutes is gonna go by.
[50:00.99]I get it.
[50:01.29]Alright, let's go.
[50:05.37]Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[50:08.39]That's the punishment.
[50:09.04]Alright, any prize, doesn't matter, just get one.
[50:16.38]What's this one?
[50:22.28]You try to get the key too?
[50:24.74]What?
[50:24.96]Okay.
[50:25.22]I want the ducky.
[50:26.10]He's gone.
[50:26.30]How am I supposed to get the ducky?
[50:27.28]Oh.
[50:27.36]What's this anime?
[50:56.54]There's only one ducky in here.
[50:58.09]Is this one easier to get, or is this one easier to get?
[50:59.53]Probably this one.
[51:01.81]There it is.
[51:02.43]Got it.
[51:02.93]Thank you!
[51:04.55]Thank you!
[51:08.09]Last year at recess, this girl in my class, Chrissy Beraducci, she got her snoot stuck in a hole near the swing set that was full of bees.
[51:15.82]Anyway, she looked kind of like this after, so I think I'll give it to her as a gift for her... bee-versary?
[51:27.56]Okay.
[51:29.12]You're ready for the ultimate prize, the doll from- Okay, the spiked haired- Okay, there it is.
[51:34.19]Oh, should I get the key?
[51:41.11]I get the key.
[51:45.03]No!
[51:45.33]I don't want Batman!
[51:46.22]Batman, I haven't seen this guy in a while.
[51:51.06]I come over da house.
[51:56.78]I know you want the doll, but I want the key.
[51:58.93]Just smash the glass and take it.
[52:09.49]What the fuck?
[52:15.06]It's gone.
[52:18.52]Alright, whatever.
[52:27.96]I need to get it.
[52:28.60]One more try.
[52:29.82]Just go.
[52:30.00]One, two, three, go.
[52:30.46]Okay, I'm done.
[52:31.00]I just gotta get- I gotta get- I'm done.
[52:33.70]I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.
[52:46.00]I don't want to mess it up.
[52:48.00]I can't- an hour can't go by. I gotta do these minigames.
[52:51.00]There's like 50 minigames, I gotta do them all.
[52:56.14]Or a reasonable amount of them to complete the game's progress.
[52:59.66]Right here.
[53:05.41]Got it.
[53:08.63]Those sounds are so loud.
[53:11.60]O-M-G's.
[53:13.63]I can't believe you got the dreamiest anime Game Boy from Final Friend City, Claude Stripes.
[53:19.68]Claude, his hair is almost as prickly as his social interactions with women.
[53:23.72]This is exactly what I wanted.
[53:25.22]Thank you so much for helping me.
[53:28.94]Claude.
[53:33.20]Okay.
[53:34.45]I can't believe the big score.
[53:36.13]Thanks to you, we had a clean getaway.
[53:37.53]Family member badge.
[53:39.77]Alright, I got one.
[53:42.25]I'll tell you what you need to know.
[53:44.89]The event is a secret.
[53:47.15]I'm a gator, not a rat.
[53:48.35]It's a birthday party.
[53:50.31]It's a birthday party.
[53:51.17]It's literally a birthday party.
[53:52.49]It's a surprise birthday party.
[53:54.27]And everyone's invited, and he thinks he's gonna get, like, killed or something.
[53:57.39]This is a birthday party.
[53:59.21]That's a birthday party.
[54:00.63]That's right, a classic double cross.
[54:02.65]That's the calling card of sweet Geraldine Master Criminal.
[54:05.51]Alright.
[54:10.23]What else we got here?
[54:12.34]Joanne.
[54:12.76]Oh, Jo... Joanie.
[54:14.82]Don't forget this.
[54:35.56]Ah, look at me, being a real jerk.
[54:37.10]I don't mean to be giving you a hard time or nothing, I've just been a little frazzled since last night.
[54:40.71]I had a dream that I was a skee-ball, and some sticky-fingered kid kept throwing me into the ten-point hole.
[54:48.49]Go for the fifty, dingus!
[54:49.71]I tried to yell, but being a ball and all, the ding-dong couldn't hear me.
[54:54.42]I woke up in a cold sweat in my kitchen, systematically throwing individual oranges from the window into my neighbor's terrarium.
[55:00.46]Vitamin C would have helped me shake it off, but all I had for breakfast was black coffee and a half a can of leftover candy cigarettes.
[55:07.65]I got a dream for you.
[55:08.93]How much time do you have?
[55:11.67]How much time do you have?
[55:12.41]Alright, what is the event?
[55:15.77]Look, I know you're here spying for Pat for whatever reason.
[55:17.73]That's fine.
[55:18.75]But I can't tell you family secrets, you feel me?
[55:21.44]If you give me info that hot, you'd have to really impress me.
[55:24.80]Alright, let's go.
[55:25.26]What do you want me to do?
[55:38.97]It smelled weird.
[55:40.18]It was a dumb kid.
[55:41.02]Alright, Pat's my cousin, and also the most genuine doof I know.
[55:47.10]So you better be nice to him, you hear?
[55:51.93]He smelled it.
[55:53.42]I don't know.
[55:54.88]The thing that popped in my head was like the Drain commercial with the guys puking.
[55:59.04]I wouldn't want to have to pop you one.
[56:01.84]I'm told I got a mean left hook and a moderately insulting right hook.
[56:06.02]And a kick that could benefit from some anger management courses.
[56:09.59]I tried to sign up for some calming hot yoga at the YACA, but it didn't go over well.
[56:15.53]You ever get kicked by your own leg?
[56:18.07]It ain't great, bud.
[56:19.69]It ain't great.
[56:20.17]Okay.
[56:21.65]My name's Joanie, or Baloney.
[56:24.81]If you're my fourth grade bully, come back to fight me.
[56:29.13]You're not, right?
[56:30.85]Damn!
[56:32.15]Anyway, I work here at Adelaide's Arcade, sweeping floors and keeping all the games running smooth as the babies ball me behind.
[56:38.15]I used to work as a greaser in a shop downtown, but I left to be closer to my gaming hobby.
[56:43.93]But let me keep the leather jacket, though.
[56:45.94]And the company hairstyle.
[56:46.64]Alright, what are we doing?
[56:51.50]So what do you think?
[56:52.12]Can you roll the ball, old timer?
[56:54.22]I'm talking pinball.
[56:55.28]The ol' pinny bee, as I like to call it.
[56:57.46]Against the advice of both of my friends, family, and the supportive therapist I see on Thursdays.
[57:02.38]I got the highest score on Lizard Wizards.
[57:04.42]Here eight months running.
[57:06.04]But I'm always looking for a real pinhead to pit my skills against.
[57:09.26]What do you say?
[57:09.72]Care to take on a pinball lizard like me?
[57:12.82]I didn't mean to make a joke.
[57:13.62]I take this very seriously.
[57:16.00]Alright, let's go.
[57:18.26]Pinball?
[57:21.36]When the ball is in play, control by clicking L and R or the keyboard.
[57:24.96]Beat 5000 points.
[57:26.88]Easy.
[57:29.88]Absolutely simple. 5000?
[57:53.15]I'm going to beat this right now.
[57:54.23]I literally just destroyed it.
[57:56.29]Has anybody played to beat your score?
[57:58.02]I just annihilated your score.
[58:03.22]It was embarrassing.
[58:11.65]That's so stupid.
[58:12.61]Pinball machines should not have this.
[58:15.80]This should never be a way for it to fall down the left and right without you doing anything.
[58:19.14]Because that's not user error.
[58:22.02]It's designed failure.
[58:23.37]Which is like, come on.
[58:24.37]Like, that's stupid.
[58:25.15]I don't know what.
[58:25.75]Pinball machines should be like completely redesigned.
[58:40.04]Mad because bad.
[58:41.62]You can't control that if it goes down there.
[58:43.22]There's nothing you can do about it.
[58:55.75]You can influence it.
[58:56.65]What?
[58:56.91]By like picking the machine up and turning it around?
[58:59.15]That's illegal.
[59:06.47]That's illegal.
[59:08.17]You can't tilt a pinball machine.
[59:09.27]You get thrown out.
[59:09.89]Fuck.
[59:21.60]It's alright.
[59:22.34]I destroyed the score.
[59:27.37]You're the annoying kid in the arcade spamming the buttons.
[59:29.65]What, because I like the sound?
[59:34.79]One of the most amazing sound effects of all time that go in this order.
[59:41.69]Running water in a river and pinball flipper sound when you press the button.
[59:48.25]Number three would probably be... Hmm.
[59:57.44]I gotta make sure I get this right.
[60:02.18]A perfect swish at a basketball hoop.
[60:05.30]In that order.
[60:07.78]Opening a can of soda is probably number four or five.
[60:13.08]Hey, it's been a long time since I've seen moves like that in front of the lizard wizards here.
[60:16.28]Got that ball hitting all the doo-whats and whoos-its so fast I can barely keep up.
[60:22.68]Releasing a big fart?
[60:23.86]No, that's not a great sound.
[60:27.36]That's like a gross sound.
[60:29.96]It's been a real honor to hang with this, another student of the pinball arts.
[60:32.77]Alright, I got a puzzle piece too.
[60:37.01]About the event, now this might be just a rumor, but word on the street, there's going to be some sick games there.
[60:41.01]It's a fucking birthday party.
[60:43.19]Not pinball, per se, but you know, you can take what you can get.
[60:46.59]That's all I can really say.
[60:48.67]I'd better get back on the grind.
[60:50.93]Trying to beat my last high score.
[60:52.70]Thanks for showing me your supple wrist and head.
[60:54.62]Catch you later.
[60:55.12]Alright, let's go.
[60:59.79]What time is it?
[61:02.29]Hey, it's me, Pat.
[61:04.53]The alligator?
[61:05.09]The one with the hat?
[61:07.25]Hi, Pat.
[61:09.27]It's almost 10.
[61:09.99]Can you come back?
[61:11.45]Someone came over to my table and threatened me.
[61:14.87]Well, they gave me a coupon and told me to have a nice day.
[61:20.61]But that could mean anything.
[61:23.49]Nobody came to threaten me.
[61:26.15]One free tomato soup.
[61:27.59]Best in New York City.
[61:28.89]Here's a coupon I got last week.
[61:31.27]If you come back, I'll give it to you.
[61:32.45]No questions asked.
[61:34.75]Alright, so I gotta go back.
[61:37.71]Am I on like a time limit?
[61:38.65]Like an actual time limit?
[61:51.40]I got some info.
[61:53.50]Ah, don't bop me!
[61:55.06]Oh, it's just you, my new friend.
[61:57.26]Sorry I saw your shadow over me.
[61:58.52]I thought some kind of restaurant assassin was descending from the rafters to take me out.
[62:07.98]It's a birthday party.
[62:10.50]Just do what everybody else fucking does and you'd act surprised even though you know what it is.
[62:16.78]It's a birthday party, relax.
[62:18.77]You're gonna walk in the door.
[62:19.83]You're gonna walk in the door and you're gonna go like this.
[62:24.45]coat off, lights are gonna come on, and you're gonna go like that, just like that.
[62:30.76]Those of you guys that have ever had a surprise birthday party that you knew about, don't get loud, because that means you knew about it.
[62:36.58]You have to go like this.
[62:37.34]You have to have like a bag in your hand, like a coat in your, like under your arm.
[62:41.80]You have to go What the?
[62:46.50]Hey!
[62:47.55]If you go like, oh, what the?
[62:49.59]It's like you knew you played it up.
[62:52.52]have to have like a bag in your hand like a like a grocery bag or like a briefcase or something you'd like to be holding it up like this and I kind of surprised thanks for the tip yeah of course don't you didn't you have to dare me when you were in elementary school you know dare dude assassins really exist at least I think that's the acronym I was absent a lot due to my nut allergy
[63:18.86]It was tough times for Pat at Willy's Peanut Butter Factory Elementary School.
[63:23.02]That's funny.
[63:25.24]Anyway, did you find out anything from the family?
[63:28.46]Well, yeah, I know the sound.
[63:29.74]They sound nice, but they just might be fluffing you up.
[63:32.96]You know, buttering your bread roll to throw you off the trail.
[63:35.34]Sorry, I've actually just been sitting here mainlining complimentary bread rolls the whole time you were gone.
[63:41.26]I'm a burger boy.
[63:48.73]We were at, I think we were at, where were we?
[63:50.27]I think we were at, like, Outback Steakhouse.
[63:54.40]And we, we ordered, like, there was, like, three or four of us, we ordered entrees.
[63:57.76]And there was, like, this big loaf of bread there.
[63:59.64]Like, the, like, the free bread.
[64:03.34]And he, he didn't, like, order anything.
[64:05.16]He wasn't hungry or, like, didn't want to, like, he didn't have, like, any cash.
[64:09.25]And I think we were probably offered to be, like, and he's, like, no, no, no, I'm not that hungry.
[64:12.65]But I don't know why he, like, didn't think it was free.
[64:16.23]I think the waiter came over and he was like, hey, is that free?
[64:20.19]They're like, yeah.
[64:21.23]And he just goes, oh, nice.
[64:22.61]And he picked it up and started eating it.
[64:25.45]It's like, what?
[64:26.15]Of course it is.
[64:28.39]He could have asked us that, right?
[64:30.47]Hey, is the bread, is that free?
[64:33.55]Yeah.
[64:35.32]I think the waiter was like, yeah.
[64:37.36]And just kept walking.
[64:40.74]And I think everybody at the table was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[64:44.64]Ugh.
[64:46.27]It's so funny.
[64:47.01]Alright.
[64:47.61]Sorry, I've actually just been sitting here mainline confirming bread rolls.
[64:51.63]And the bread from Outback Steakhouse was actually fucking unbelievable.
[64:56.87]You can say whatever you want about some of these chain restaurants.
[64:59.68]I remember that it was like this little loaf.
[65:04.08]I think it was like pumpernickel.
[65:07.36]What is it?
[65:09.74]The bread from Outback is like the best thing in the whole restaurant.
[65:13.38]Like the whole restaurant.
[65:15.89]They gave you this kind of butter that you really had to really stick the knife in and really move it around.
[65:21.41]I mean, literally everything else at Outback, I don't remember if it was good or not, but that little, it was a tiny little loaf.
[65:26.33]Oh, it was awesome.
[65:31.10]Yeah, the bread is unbelievable.
[65:31.98]It's really good there.
[65:33.66]Is it actually, or is he insane?
[65:35.06]No, no, I swear.
[65:35.94]Oh, there's a time limit.
[65:36.72]Alright.
[65:38.42]And let's loggy with bread.
[65:40.40]Let's go.
[65:40.74]We going?
[65:46.49]there it is yep yep yep oh and the butter too that butter's perfect yep this is it hold on that's it I can that's exactly what it is this is the bread from outback the only thing I remember
[66:15.30]Look at the butter, too.
[66:16.82]Yeah, the butter was so good.
[66:21.21]Like, is it weird that I would want to go to Outback and just order, like, an appetizer?
[66:26.09]And just be like, uh, I would pay for the bread.
[66:28.53]Right?
[66:28.79]Like, if, you know, it's like, oh, yeah, do you want, like, more bread?
[66:32.59]They'll do that, right?
[66:33.25]They'll come back, you want some more bread?
[66:35.29]But I almost kind of want to be like, hey, can you just, like, can I just, like, mac and cheese?
[66:38.92]And just, you bring out, like, five of these?
[66:40.58]I'll pay for them.
[66:41.20]Like, I'll pay for whatever you would think they would cost.
[66:44.94]Whatever they are, I'll pay for it.
[66:49.04]Bread tier list.
[66:49.72]That's how I feel about Olive Garden.
[66:55.69]Breadsticks from Olive Garden are actually really good.
[66:59.57]Steak houses have, like, really banging bread.
[67:03.11]Yeah.
[67:03.92]You can order it to go.
[67:04.66]Really?
[67:06.90]Bread makes you fat.
[67:11.88]So what?
[67:15.45]Alright, my safe place.
[67:16.85]Find the code to Pat's abode.
[67:20.91]Tell Pat to remember his room code.
[67:27.26]Thanks for protecting me.
[67:27.92]It really helps to have someone walk me to my room.
[67:31.02]The wallpaper in here is a little intense.
[67:33.26]It makes me feel like something is staring at me.
[67:38.82]What am I gonna do?
[67:39.40]My heart can't take ten more hours of waiting.
[67:42.62]What's the event?
[67:43.24]What did I squeal the beans on?
[67:45.30]Cheese and crackers?
[67:46.80]Am I gonna finally catch this furry for the first time ever?
[68:02.65]Come on.
[68:04.51]Every time I think about it, it just doesn't happen.
[68:09.11]I'm ready if it does.
[68:09.65]Okay.
[68:10.77]It's a virus website.
[68:40.07]This is Pat's homepage, generated by Geoscalies?
[68:46.15]Warning.
[68:49.42]Don't click Pat only.
[68:50.54]About me.
[68:51.40]Sorry, under construction.
[68:56.06]What is that?
[68:56.56]Is this the code?
[69:04.11]About me.
[69:06.41]I'm Pat.
[69:16.47]Okay, don't click Pat only.
[69:17.85]If you're not Pat, you're breaking the law.
[69:20.13]This has been reported to the computer police.
[69:22.07]91619.
[69:22.91]Okay.
[69:23.11]I got it.

[70:22.85]Thank you so much.
[70:32.07]Whoa!
[70:33.17]I can't close it.
[70:33.69]What's going on?
[70:34.37]Help.

[70:49.67]Oops.
[70:53.97]Oh my gosh!
[70:59.59]Hello?
[71:00.11]My word!
[71:00.75]This is quite the mess.
[71:01.79]Who are you two, and why have you opened my door?
[71:04.07]Who am I?
[71:07.01]I'm Pat!
[71:07.43]This is my hotel room!
[71:08.37]I installed this locker because my family's trying to rub me out!
[71:11.87]This is my door where I've installed a lock because my family's trying to rub me out.
[71:17.33]But if that's true and my password still worked... Is your lock code 91619?
[71:25.44]Is your lock code 91619?
[71:28.44]We have the same code!
[71:29.36]And our families are both trying to kill us!
[71:36.03]This is very funny.
[71:41.67]Do we actually have the same code?
[72:17.94]This is awkward.
[72:18.54]I'm not saying anything.
[72:19.81]Alright, if you have pink stuff in here, it's going to be wild Quincy.
[72:30.39]Alright, here we go.
[72:35.06]Thanks, I never would have remembered that on my own.
[72:37.12]Come on in.
[72:44.46]I'm so glad we made it inside.
[72:45.46]Now I can really try to relax.
[72:46.56]It's hard to distract you from the investigation.
[72:49.26]I'll text you again when it gets closer to 4pm.
[72:51.70]So don't forget to check your watch.
[72:53.68]You know, in case you do get distracted doing a collection of menial tasks formatted in an enjoyable manner.
[72:58.22]Something like that.
[73:00.06]Alright.
[73:04.30]Bye for now.
[73:10.83]Do I have any minigames?
[73:11.55]Wait, who's that?
[73:29.78]God damn it!
[73:32.84]Ugh.
[73:34.58]It's not nice about sitting by yourself in a restaurant with a good book.
[73:37.88]Come on.
[73:43.37]My girlfriend's coming to pick me up after work.
[73:44.87]I'm so nervous.
[73:48.39]What's in the kitchen?
[73:49.21]That was so scary and loud.
[74:01.62]Oh, puzzle piece.
[74:03.42]Puzzle piece!
[74:12.57]Aw, wait!
[74:14.35]Sound effect number five in the top five list is coffee pouring into a mug.
[74:19.25]Yep.
[74:25.69]Hey, bub, you're just in time for the... The trolley got here a minute ago.
[74:31.42]Okay.
[74:32.96]Why don't you go check out the city?
[74:35.92]Bring Mickey a hot dog, maybe.
[74:37.50]Or some protective handwear.
[74:38.62]I'm gross.
[74:39.30]Okay.
[74:43.49]But hold on, there's people here.
[74:44.25]Who's this?
[74:47.07]If you eat a John, Johnny's here.
[74:48.97]Food's alright, but that bottomless chowder bowl was a disaster.
[74:52.53]Pick that thing up and bam!
[74:53.71]Chowder pants the rest of the day.
[74:55.69]Classic fucking comedy.
[74:58.33]Classic comedy.
[75:01.46]Oh dear, I think I may have left my scrapbooking scissors at home on accident.
[75:05.82]Oh, I found my scissors!
[75:06.66]Must have been your approach that gave me good luck, stranger!
[75:08.74]Hehe!
[75:08.96]I'm gonna try to go outside, home more, since I had the new baby.
[75:14.03]Nana is watching her today, so here I am, out in the world.
[75:16.57]It's a little nerve-wracking to be away from the nursery after those months, to be honest.
[75:22.47]I already miss all the new baby smells.
[75:25.15]Well, not all the spells.
[75:26.89]We all know more things come out of babies than just sweet fragments of their cute little heads.
[75:32.25]Well, even that stuff is a little cute.
[75:33.67]I'm Maria.
[75:38.43]It's wonderful to meet you.
[75:40.59]I was heading to the local YACA before I ran into you.
[75:43.57]I'm taking a class there today on scrapbooking, but I'm a little early.
[75:47.56]I meant to wait here in the lovely weather until their class on mom yoga and self-defense ends.
[75:54.34]Eat.
[75:54.52]Pray.
[75:55.26]Shove.
[75:55.98]Hehe.
[76:00.86]Do you mean my son, Pat?
[76:02.73]Oh, I'm just so proud of him.
[76:05.07]It's his birthday today.
[76:06.21]Did you?
[76:06.53]I fucking told you.
[76:08.45]I told all of you.
[76:11.53]Why is he not doing voices?
[76:12.53]This is depressing.
[76:14.45]What?
[76:14.75]It's a long game.
[76:18.71]It's a birthday!
[76:20.87]It's a birthday.
[76:21.48]I told you it's a birthday.
[76:24.90]He's so funny with how he treats himself to a hotel stay every year on the day.
[76:28.34]He just loves that continental breakfast.
[76:31.32]Voice is Orion.
[76:39.07]You're going to make me get up and sing?
[76:42.37]Oh, yeah.
[76:43.79]Jeremy has a really good voice, don't you, Jeremy?
[76:46.15]Why don't you get up and sing for us?
[76:56.34]Twinkle, twinkle, little star Like, I don't want to do that.
[77:01.64]Why am I... Stop doing that.
[77:02.94]I don't want to do it.
[77:06.91]I do get concerned he eats too many of those, however.
[77:09.59]Sud shouldn't be coming out the snoot of a boy that age.
[77:11.87]Alright, what about the event?
[77:22.89]It's his birthday!
[77:25.01]The event is why I'm taking this class today.
[77:26.77]Okay, so what do you need?
[77:33.54]Help a mom out.
[77:35.12]Trying to put together our family tree to bring tonight at so- uh, yeah.
[77:39.40]I don't have everyone's picture.
[77:41.56]It's so hard for all of us to get together in one place these days.
[77:43.79]I don't think anyone would like me to use their photos from the early 2000s.
[77:47.91]We all made some questionable wardrobe decisions back then.
[77:51.21]Since you're already going around town, would you mind snapping some pictures of the family?
[78:02.35]And you get to... And you get and bring back a foot in the family tree.
[78:06.56]Maybe if you get them all, something good will happen.
[78:11.72]Oh, I see you already have one there.
[78:12.86]Can you put it in?
[78:14.36]Let's see how much you learned so far.
[78:38.37]What do I know so far?
[78:42.09]Look and drag the alligator portraits in a position of the family tree.
[78:45.65]Come back anytime to see your collection.
[78:51.35]Oh my god, there's so many people.
[78:56.19]How many people are in this family?
[78:57.58]There's like 50, there's a... It's like the Elden Ring family tree.
[79:10.45]Look, there's a fucking million people!
[79:11.79]I don't know anybody!
[79:24.94]Can I take your picture?
[79:33.28]Where's my camera?
[79:38.24]Ain't nobody can follow these ferocious fingies.
[79:41.67]Where's my camera?
[79:45.87]I want to take a picture of these people.
[79:50.81]You already got her picture, but now we take a picture of everybody else.
[79:52.68]Alright, let's go to... Let's go to the fun district.
[80:03.57]I'm in the fun district.
[80:08.31]You got them from the minigame.
[80:09.53]Oh!
[80:19.27]God.
[80:22.75]Unknown.
[80:23.13]Hey again, your friendly city guide here.
[80:25.55]So I was wondering, have you been finding any puzzle pieces around?
[80:29.56]I'm gonna write in all capitals, STOP.
[80:37.02]Unsubscribe.
[80:39.93]I thought so!
[80:41.19]You can find a lot of fun things you might not expect in the city by clicking around.
[80:45.25]puzzle pieces, secret baubles to look at, interestingly shaped sewer rats.
[80:48.91]It's a real menagerie.
[80:52.53]Maybe if you find enough pieces, you'll be able to do something good with them.
[80:55.73]Like unlock something.
[80:56.79]Maybe make a small blanket for a family of chilly squirrels.
[81:00.45]The world is so bright.
[81:02.08]Have lots of fun looking around.
[81:03.00]Oh, there's all kinds of... Wait.
[81:07.78]I sell bugs.
[81:10.32]Bugs, bugs, bugs.
[81:11.20]Alright, I'm going off.
[81:12.98]You know that there's like an old person I'm going to do this for, right?
[81:15.82]Bugs, bugs for sale, more than one even, unlike what the sign implies.
[81:20.30]Yeah, I sell bugs here.
[81:24.08]No, not for baitin', for eatin'.
[81:26.60]We're alligators and we eat bugs, which is something you know because you exist here, canonically.
[81:32.98]Anyway, get bug buyin' or goodbye, kiddo.
[81:37.07]Ain't got all day.
[81:39.23]But I gotta sell bugs to feed my family with different bugs, which I buy with an alligator currency.
[81:47.47]What do you know about the event?
[81:51.65]The event?
[81:53.05]I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.
[81:55.71]I have a selective memory disorder, you see, in that I forget about things I don't really want to go to.
[82:03.50]What do you know about Pat?
[82:05.48]Oh, did you say Pat?
[82:06.30]That's my grandson's name.
[82:08.42]But also the name of the nurse that comes to massage the kinks out of my tail on Tuesdays.
[82:13.70]Does it mean Pat or Pat?
[82:15.98]When I have to speak up, I'm hard of hearing due to a condition where I stop listening mid-sentence and think about the war.
[82:24.12]Most people call me Capuli, but my real name is Mortimer Giles Jr., the third and a half, on account of my grandfather being perfectly bisected by a wheat thresher during the Great Depression.
[82:37.21]Miraculously, he survived, but his life wasn't without its problems.
[82:41.45]Such as how it was hard to see him when he turned directly to one side.
[82:45.92]Grandpa, where are you?
[82:47.00]We'd call, but to no avail.
[82:48.26]He'd already slipped through a crack in the deck of the linoleum.
[82:52.08]It's the last time we ever saw him, and also when those basement sounds started up.
[82:56.94]Well, look at me rambling here to a youth about cellar screams and the like.
[83:03.12]Perhaps you could jog this old man's memory if you'd help me out with a favor.
[83:07.70]You see, the only photo I have left of my dear late wife, Martha, has also been the victim of a wheat fresher incident.
[83:15.17]I can't seem to put it back together again.
[83:17.65]Oh, how I'd give anything to see Master's sweet smile again.
[83:21.18]Gotta help this old socky gaze upon his love, lost love once more.
[83:28.12]Sure, Grandpa.
[83:28.84]I'll help you.
[83:29.32]Get the pieces glued for this old dude.
[83:33.12]Make my wife please.
[83:34.62]Okay.
[83:39.30]Take a block to slide it into the empty space.
[83:41.08]It would be a very simple picture to gaze upon the alligator's beautiful wife.
[83:49.61]Am I actually on a timer for this?
[83:50.71]Alright, this is gonna go up.
[84:15.11]Fuck, I'm so bad at these.
[84:16.05]You have no idea.
[84:27.33]Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[84:33.24]Oh, it's close, it's close, it's close, I got it, I got it.
[84:36.52]Almost.
[84:43.24]I got it, this is it, I got it, I just did it!
[84:44.60]I got it, I just did it, I just did it!
[84:45.96]I literally just did it, that was in record time.
[84:48.96]That's it, I just did it.
[84:49.60]Achoo!
[84:58.70]Oh no.
[85:04.08]Oh dear, it seems you've seen the other side now with my secret wife.
[85:07.88]Could you put this one back together too?
[85:10.52]If not for me, then for creepy old coot grandpas everywhere?
[85:15.35]What?
[85:17.81]Oh no.
[85:22.93]What the hell?
[85:24.33]I don't know.
[85:24.71]This is gonna take so long.
[85:25.55]I'm not gonna be able to do this one.
[85:34.53]This has got to go top left.
[85:36.90]Just get this where it needs to be.
[85:53.21]Is that the right way?
[85:56.91]I think it's probably like that, right?
[85:58.71]This?
[86:06.74]what it looks like you're not very good at this no not taking this okay that's correct but I gotta get it over there alright um why are there two why there's like three people in this picture
[86:46.19]Who is this?
[86:53.41]Where does this go?
[86:56.71]Somebody in the front?
[87:00.84]Whose head belongs on here?
[87:02.04]I don't get it.
[87:08.46]Whose fucking head goes on here?
[87:32.13]Alright, it's that one.
[87:35.39]And then there's three people in this picture.
[87:37.93]Oh, leave me alone.
[87:48.57]This is here.
[87:49.15]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[88:08.44]Okay, so he's all the way to the left.
[88:11.81]Right?
[88:13.31]She's in the middle.
[88:15.23]Right?
[88:29.89]Right?
[88:59.38]This is hard.
[89:00.06]That's not right.
[89:16.19]I'm so confused.
[89:17.79]Is it?
[89:18.21]Wait, wait.
[89:18.99]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[89:19.83]Bring everything down.
[89:21.17]Bring everything down.
[89:22.89]Bring everything down.
[89:36.80]Shit!
[89:37.41]I can't do these.
[89:39.41]This is too much.
[89:42.93]This is correct, but I don't want to touch this.
[90:10.25]Dammit, this is down here.
[91:22.17]Chat, please be supportive.
[91:23.89]Dude, it's hard.
[91:25.45]You're nearly there.
[91:26.21]I know, I'm almost there.
[91:27.16]I just gotta get it correct.
[91:34.23]Alright, this has gotta go up there.
[91:35.77]Let me just get it over there.
[91:50.37]Okay, that's done.
[91:51.71]This whole side is done.
[91:52.82]Don't touch it.
[92:21.82]It's close.
[92:33.03]Oh, so close.
[92:34.24]Come on.
[92:34.78]Alright, don't touch this one.
[92:38.52]Can I do it without touching that?
[93:00.82]I'm melting.
[93:03.22]I'm doing it.
[93:07.66]It's so close.
[93:08.47]I'm almost there.
[93:12.31]This has got to come over here.
[93:13.41]Alright.
[93:14.95]I just got to do this.
[93:54.63]Stop making fun of me!
[93:57.68]What's it doing?
[93:58.86]Get out of here!
[94:13.29]I can't do it.
[94:14.27]I can't do it.
[94:15.63]I can't do it.
[94:17.51]I can't do it.
[94:18.07]It's like... It's too... It's like my brain cannot do it.
[94:22.44]My brain can't do it.
[94:24.14]Even if I sit there and think for a second, it's just like... Like that's all I hear.
[94:29.26]All I hear in my head is... There's nothing but that sound.
[95:19.39]I can't.
[95:19.87]It's so easy.
[95:37.22]This is harder than Malenia.
[95:39.07]I beat Malenia.
[95:41.62]Look, everybody has a left brain and a right brain, okay?
[95:46.46]My left brain is this big.
[95:50.00]It's this big.
[95:52.50]It's like you'd have to go under a microscope to look at it.
[95:55.64]My right brain is so large, it's swelling up my skull.
[96:01.21]You get it?
[96:02.21]It's like, oh my goodness, it's swelling up so much, I can't even, it's so much.
[96:06.79]You have to go under a microscope to find the other side.
[96:11.15]microscope left brain right brain is a myth yeah but whatever you could like whatever we could speculate we don't even know okay we don't know how the dinosaurs died we're speculating it was a meteor yeah we don't know that we don't know how they died they could have something else could happen they could have like eaten each other there could have been like an explosion from a volcano not a meteor who knows we don't know
[96:37.68]A big rock, you don't know?
[96:39.12]A big rock could have hit it, yeah.
[96:40.62]But also, there could have been like a volcano that erupted, a huge one, like a super mega volcano, right?
[96:46.32]Nobody knows.
[96:50.26]All we can do is we can look at fossils in the ground and go, that was a meteor, I think, yep.
[96:55.31]We don't know, nobody knows.
[96:56.35]We don't know, you don't know, you don't know anything.
[96:57.77]You don't know anything, this puzzle's hard, you couldn't do it.
[97:07.37]Alright, alright, I got it.
[97:08.89]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[97:33.24]Bro, there's like one thing I can't do and it's these fucking sliding puzzles.
[97:40.70]Break up the right column.
[97:41.80]I... And who cares?
[97:44.46]What is the... Who cares if you can't do a sliding puzzle?
[97:47.12]Does it really matter?
[97:48.30]Does that really matter that much?
[97:50.36]That doesn't matter.
[97:51.22]Oh, you can't do one of those... Who can't... Oh, does it matter?
[97:54.08]Oh, can't do it.
[97:56.02]Oh, no.
[97:56.59]I can't do the sliding puzzles.
[98:00.79]I can't... Who cares?
[98:19.72]Oh, I got it!
[98:30.97]What if there was a life-threatening situation where there was an escape room and you had to get out within 10 minutes for that?
[98:37.23]Or like, nah, I'm dead.
[98:38.46]I'm just dead.
[98:39.24]I'm gonna die.
[98:41.78]I literally die.
[98:43.24]I literally die.
[98:46.31]One of you could have said in the chat, hey dude, I'm going to give $50 million in bits if you do this in 10 minutes.
[98:55.38]I wouldn't do it.
[98:56.66]I actually wouldn't have been able to do it.
[98:58.04]I would have been like, oh my god.
[98:58.98]And I wouldn't have done it.
[99:02.09]I just wouldn't have done it.
[99:04.73]I got it though.
[99:05.15]That was fun.
[99:14.25]Oh, Gertie, good old Gertie.
[99:16.61]It's been years since I've looked upon your sweet curly hair and your man-breaking arms.
[99:21.93]Thank you so much for your help, stranger.
[99:23.59]Thanks to you, I'm reunited with both my lost loves.
[99:27.55]I just have, like, this bread image sitting here.
[99:35.28]Martha passed years ago, but Gertie is just in witness protection.
[99:39.70]You know, from all the man-breaking.
[99:42.69]What a firecracker, that gal.
[99:44.31]On full days, I could still feel the phantom broken body pains she left me.
[99:48.54]Hey, event?
[99:50.00]Oh, you mean tonight's event?
[99:54.48]You young folk love staying up late.
[99:57.00]Me, I'm in bed by six nightly after a modest dinner of soft bug puddings and four to seven episodes of soft flutes on public broadcast.
[100:05.51]Anyway, kiddo, thanks again for helping me out, or should I say helping three out?
[100:12.80]Don't tell my grandkids.
[100:14.38]And look, here's a little something for your trouble.
[100:15.76]Puzzle piece.
[100:17.78]Alright, no more slide puzzles and we'll be fine.
[100:29.12]The breeze, the practicing quartet, what a perfect day to be a live alligator.
[100:37.67]Sleepy pants.
[100:43.45]Oh no, the snipper.
[100:45.73]Are you here about joining the resistance?
[100:48.55]Come to the front door, but don't let the feds tail you.
[100:51.14]Password is the only thing worth fighting for.
[100:55.00]Justice Absolute, which is also the name of my favorite Marx-leaning scabam.
[100:59.56]Yes, I said favorite.
[101:00.36]There are more than one.
[101:03.83]No GMOs.
[101:04.19]That's no governors may opt in.
[101:06.15]Heh.
[101:20.27]Which event?
[101:21.29]I have four events to go to this week alone.
[101:24.34]Like tomorrow, it's Minestrone Monday at the Soup Kitchen.
[101:27.26]Then it's on to Taco Tuesday at the Women's Shelter.
[101:31.60]Wednesday doesn't have a funny name, but everyone does get those cupcakes with the white squiggly as an extra at the Alligator Food Bank.
[101:39.20]If you're talking about tonight, though, you might as well go act like a cop somewhere else, Officer Pinstripes.
[101:44.49]I don't rat out my comrades.
[101:46.79]My name is bolted up so tight, the Count of Monte Cristo has spent years trying to escape from me while plotting his vengeance against those who wronged him.
[101:56.82]We just finished reading that book in my Tuesday lit class.
[102:00.08]Pretty baller, to be honest.
[102:01.34]I love revenge and breakfast.
[102:03.62]What do you know about Pat, though?
[102:06.75]Do you mean Hat Pat or do you mean Bat Pat?
[102:10.49]No, no, you probably mean Hat Pat.
[102:12.90]Bat Pat is my high school neighbor.
[102:15.36]He used to pick me up for DSA meetings on Friday, until he got grounded.
[102:19.30]He'd apparently broken his... Nye... Nye's favorite set of extremely fragile and large-eyed porcelain deer with something.
[102:28.38]A club?
[102:28.76]Well, it's not important.
[102:30.72]We'll spring him eventually.
[102:32.22]Yes, Dad, I mean legally.
[102:34.88]Anyway, hat pad isn't okay, dude.
[102:36.16]I barely know the guy, but he still made me punch-proof vest to... He made me a punch-proof vest to wear to protests out of Dr. Soda bottle caps.
[102:45.73]He's a stand-up alligator.
[102:47.95]Maybe he drinks too much soda, though.
[102:49.25]Doesn't he know what the government puts in that stuff?
[102:52.81]I tell you, if the CIA agent that watches my cell phone would probably delete my chumbler in vengeance.
[102:57.81]That's where I keep all my pictures of day one.
[103:02.52]What?
[103:04.44]I can have other interests besides the cause.
[103:06.13]Alright, what do you- what do you- what do you want me to do?
[103:17.74]Listen, I'm not trying to give you crud about Pat or something, I'm just a little stressed out.
[103:22.02]Not to go all First World Probs on you, Bobs, but I have a... zine due to be scanned tomorrow afternoon.
[103:30.31]If I miss this deadline, it won't get printed in time for the Indie Comics Annual People with Bangs Convention this weekend.
[103:36.73]You know how long it takes to staple a stack of these zines?
[103:41.35]At least two full episodes listening to Gator Crater, a true crime podcast about the world's most blown-up alligators.
[103:48.62]Yes, Dad, I also have Algebra 2 homework.
[103:52.42]If you could help me put some of these pictures together, maybe I could give you the straight dope about the dope.
[103:56.50]Are you ready to join the resistance?
[103:59.78]Okay.
[104:01.18]Make paper word salad because your voice is valid.
[104:03.81]Smells like Zine spirit.
[104:07.97]Known as Zine needs to cover three topics evenly.
[104:10.23]Choose a clip to add to the Zine and click the page to glue it in place.
[104:13.99]Be careful, some clips cover two topics at once.
[104:18.77]So check it, pinstripes have already done all the hard design stuff.
[104:21.79]Like picking the clips and cutting everything with semi-straight lines.
[104:25.74]I need you to pick a good selection, then glue them into place.
[104:29.10]Sadly, ever since the stickening of 2017, I'm not allowed to use glue myself.
[104:35.26]Or glue sticks.
[104:36.16]Or rubber cement.
[104:36.94]Or large stickers.
[104:37.92]Or small stickers.
[104:38.66]So you're going to have to be the hero that sticks the picks.
[104:42.29]This sign encompasses, of course, the three most important, most ziny things possible.
[104:48.37]I'm talking about social issues, indie comics, and K-pop, obviously.
[104:52.49]These three topics go together like peanut butter, jelly, and a third comparable thing that escapes me at this moment.
[104:58.12]That doesn't mean we can lean into any one more than the other.
[105:00.98]My zine has to be balanced or people will think I'm biased.
[105:04.88]That means no page space for anything more than the other.
[105:08.67]So pick up a pick and get ready to stick.
[105:10.45]Careful though, I have a limited selection of content and my glue is forever.
[105:13.91]Just ask my hamster.
[105:16.46]Grip in Valhalla, Goopy the 3rd, 2015-2017.
[105:18.56]Zine, for god's sake.
[105:21.67]Zine.
[105:22.13]What?
[105:22.51]Magazine.
[105:23.19]Oh.
[105:23.33]A magazine.
[105:30.56]When you're done, we'll ask the editor if it's ready to scan, so get pasting.
[105:33.55]Okay.
[105:35.31]So what was it?
[105:37.23]The cover is really important.
[105:38.27]It has to portray the essence of what's on the inside.
[105:40.37]More like choosing what ironically humorous t-shirt to sport at Rosh Hashanah that'll really unsettle your extended family.
[105:50.60]Wait, what?
[105:51.28]No, I didn't want to choose that!
[105:54.42]Eat it, Wibbly Finn.
[105:56.32]This will get him canceled for sure.
[105:59.51]I just clicked on the first one.
[106:00.59]Don't forget to balance the topics.
[106:02.73]Okay.
[106:05.61]I wouldn't want anyone to accuse me of political bias or standing bias.
[106:08.82]Okay, so we already did Wibbly Finn, right?
[106:14.20]This one?
[106:17.62]Guys together forever.
[106:22.20]Together forever.
[106:23.42]Okay.
[106:26.04]What's this one?
[106:29.21]It's like a meme, alright?
[106:30.15]Jesus.
[106:30.29]Do we really want someone who eat- Do we really want someone who eat a sad lunch for another term in office?
[106:36.27]Oh my god.
[106:54.32]That's fucking crazy.
[106:56.06]That's so, like, sad.
[106:57.20]To be honest, this one kind of Mondo bums me out.
[107:03.47]I didn't win the Zine Award last year.
[107:05.35]Yeah, last year's con, but I did place third in Cool Bangs.
[107:11.61]Joshua Ransom?
[107:14.87]Oh, okay.
[107:15.31]Wait, this is a, like, celebrity or something?
[107:17.40]I didn't really get an interview.
[107:18.22]This is just what I hope he'd say to me.
[107:20.86]Ah, I love you, JR.
[107:21.88]Hope you read this.
[107:24.91]This is balancing it out, right?
[107:30.23]Question.
[107:30.97]Oh, okay.
[107:31.85]That's okay.
[107:32.55]I love you.
[107:33.11]What type of girls do you like?
[107:34.61]Oh, any kind, but mostly the kind that are like you on the inside.
[107:37.12]This one's a real exclusive.
[107:38.12]I can't believe we got it.
[107:42.16]Last inside page is a hard hitter.
[107:43.66]You have to really leave them wanting more.
[107:46.38]Like, really, actually more.
[107:47.80]Like, maybe they'll give you a couple more bucks to pick up a few more for their comrades.
[107:57.62]This is Lois.
[107:58.34]She feels Wibbly Finn is an inadequate mayor.
[108:03.30]Balance the budget?
[108:04.06]He can't even balance on this log in his own yard, nonetheless.
[108:07.12]Alright, yeah.
[108:08.48]This isn't particularly damning, but I pride my zines on delivering... Oh god.
[108:14.21]Healthcare or public restroom chocolate fountain?
[108:17.87]Wibbly Finn would rather save the scales on his back than weigh in on what matters.
[108:26.97]But no, we can't be too- we can't be too political.
[108:30.83]We can't be too- this is- we already got political.
[108:32.51]Oh, will I always be so alone and destined to be on my own?
[108:38.73]At least all this guy misunderstands is still streaming.
[108:42.61]Final season!
[108:46.22]Okay.
[108:48.52]This one really taps into the deep well of the soul.
[108:53.24]We're almost there, just pace on the back cover and we'll be done.
[108:59.51]Mayor Wibblefin.
[109:02.69]Uncompromising hair.
[109:04.41]Partisan teeth.
[109:05.77]He's got an okay hand.
[109:07.43]Cherry mandering fingers.
[109:08.96]Embezzling tail.
[109:13.12]Mayor Wibblefin would make a terrible addition to the K-pop group 8 Guys, and therefore we should examine what type of politicians we really want to hold office in our beloved city.
[109:22.39]As you can see from this photo, he just doesn't fit, and therefore the case is made that he is out of touch despite his effort to not look out of touch, and looks gross here in this photo.
[109:37.53]Okay, I don't like it.
[109:38.81]This one makes me feel as if it's a really solid case.
[109:42.66]You're all done, hand it over.
[109:47.03]I said fair and balanced, but you're clearly favoring one topic over the others.
[109:50.28]I should have known better than to ask an outsider.
[109:52.40]What?
[109:52.66]I got it wrong?
[109:54.42]What?
[109:57.06]Oh my god.
[109:57.64]Alright, there's three topics.
[109:58.88]Let me just get it right.
[110:02.24]Shit.
[110:02.62]Alright.
[110:04.33]Not more than one or the other.
[110:05.43]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[110:11.75]The mayor ones were just kind of funny.
[110:13.61]Okay.
[110:15.43]Alright, we're gonna start with the mayor.
[110:16.63]Exposing the mayor.
[110:17.41]Okay.
[110:20.93]Expose.
[110:21.55]Start with the mayor.
[110:25.09]Then... Not too much mayor, so we're gonna go with... This is the band eight guys.
[110:35.56]So we have one for the mayor, one for eight guys.
[110:40.21]Now I need... Okay, this is like a little comic book or something.
[110:45.27]Meme.
[110:47.05]Okay.
[110:50.27]So I've got one of each.
[110:52.79]Sad Meal.
[110:53.45]We have two mayors and one of the others.
[110:58.62]Two mayors.
[111:00.68]This is also because we have two eight guys and two mayors.
[111:05.00]Okay.
[111:09.90]Now we need something that's not the mayor or eight guys.
[111:14.58]Is this one?
[111:15.80]Nope.
[111:17.70]Nope.
[111:18.90]Shit.
[111:20.73]This is three eight guys, two mayor, one of something else.
[111:28.25]This is three mayor.
[111:29.91]Nope.
[111:30.41]Wait, hold on.
[111:35.73]Alright, this is like a comic book.
[111:37.23]We have three eight guys, two mayor, two.
[111:40.08]Right?
[111:43.28]Right?
[111:43.78]Is it a comic book?
[111:46.66]Alright, so we're almost there.
[111:48.32]Just paste it on the back cover, so now we need another comic book, right?
[111:53.26]Is that going to be alright?
[111:58.48]This one, right?
[111:58.98]Would that be 3-2-3?
[111:59.92]Or is that 2-3-2?
[112:06.61]Will that be enough?
[112:08.65]Is this eight guys?
[112:10.92]Oh, that's eight guys.
[112:11.84]NO!
[112:12.20]I didn't want to click- I wanted to put it over!
[112:13.64]Okay, whatever, we'll do it again.
[112:14.98]We're gonna do it again, we're gonna do it- whatever, whatever, whatever.
[112:18.90]I wanted to switch it.
[112:19.68]I clicked paste.
[112:20.94]Fuck!
[112:23.46]Another hour is gonna go by.
[112:24.62]Alright, fuck!
[112:25.52]Help me!
[112:25.86]Keep track.
[112:28.97]Shit, I wanted to move it!
[112:32.55]Okay, okay, okay, okay, what do I start with?
[112:35.14]I'm not gonna start with the mayor, there's too many mayors.
[112:42.80]Don't open with the mayor.
[112:44.56]Open with, um... This one.
[112:49.30]I'm gonna open with the comic book one, right?
[112:52.56]That makes sense.
[112:56.00]Indie comic.
[112:59.90]One.
[113:01.37]Now I can do... I can do eight guys, and the mayor,
[113:07.35]Okay, so we need to do meme.
[113:12.77]And now we need a mayor.
[113:15.36]There we go.
[113:16.52]We're pretty balanced now, right?
[113:17.52]So that's two comic, one of the other ones.
[113:26.12]Okay, here we go.
[113:27.69]This is two comic, two, um, eight guys.
[113:32.39]Right?
[113:33.89]Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, wait.
[113:34.71]Is this an eight guys person?
[113:36.51]This is both eight guys.
[113:42.39]Is this a comic?
[113:43.29]Okay, wait, so this is eight guys, yep.
[113:44.70]Okay, so we have two eight guys, two comic, one mayor.
[113:52.16]We need another mayor.
[113:54.34]Okay, we gotta balance this out.
[113:55.72]What's this one?
[113:58.12]We need a mayor?
[114:00.76]Eight guys.
[114:01.70]The last one needs to be a comic and that's it.
[114:04.88]Right?
[114:10.78]Mayor and comic?
[114:11.65]I don't have mayor and comic, do I?
[114:15.99]My only options are mayor, right?
[114:18.41]So eight guys, comic.
[114:25.19]No comic for the back cover.
[114:27.65]You will have to have a comic.
[114:28.65]Jeremy, if two people... The last one can be mayor.
[114:35.01]Eight guys, burgers, and fries.
[114:37.35]By the way, keep comic mayor.
[114:40.43]Which I do.
[114:41.55]Right now it's one politics, two kpop, two indie comic.
[114:45.33]So this would be 2-2-2.
[114:48.53]But... Fuck, help me.
[114:51.13]Mayor, then comic book.
[114:53.75]This is mayor.
[114:57.06]Now we get comic book.
[114:59.50]And then the back cover is 8 guys and that's it.
[115:02.70]And that's it, right?
[115:03.34]I think?
[115:07.91]Back cover is comic book?
[115:09.99]I think that's correct.
[115:17.68]Then we end up with a comic and that's it.
[115:19.10]We got it.
[115:20.80]Got it.
[115:21.10]That's it.
[115:21.84]No!
[115:22.00]That's 8 guys!
[115:28.88]Did I get it?
[115:30.74]That's two, three... Does this count as both?
[115:35.39]The back cover is mayor and... This is comic though, technically, right?
[115:45.65]Do the mayor one?
[115:48.75]This counts as mayor and comic.
[115:56.70]This one is mayor and comic.
[116:00.31]Right?
[116:01.57]This is cringe.
[116:03.61]I think that's good.
[116:05.95]That should be it, right?
[116:07.57]This is mayor in K-pop.
[116:09.45]Mayor- I need mayor in comic.
[116:12.99]Alright, this is gonna be the one.
[116:16.01]What do I need?
[116:23.86]Comic was the cover.
[116:26.58]This is- this is it.
[116:30.50]Alright, that's it.
[116:32.40]That would be three, three, three.
[116:35.98]Guys.
[116:38.40]I'm just gonna write it fucking down.
[116:39.36]I'm gonna write this shit down.
[116:41.40]I can't, I've ran out of time.
[116:42.86]I've run out of time.
[116:45.28]I didn't, I didn't know there could be two different things.
[116:48.24]Fuck.
[116:55.70]God damn it.
[116:56.36]Alright, I get it.
[116:57.00]I'm gonna write it down.
[116:57.60]I'm literally gonna write it down.
[117:13.15]What are we doing?
[117:20.11]Okay.
[117:21.41]Cover needs to be comic.
[117:25.56]We got one comic.
[117:31.50]Some covers are two topics.
[117:32.76]Alright, so we need the comic cover.
[117:36.16]Alright.
[117:38.56]Then we want...
[117:42.94]No, 8 guys?
[117:45.78]1, 8 guys.
[117:50.41]I don't know.
[117:55.39]Which one covers all 3?
[117:56.05]This one does?
[118:00.39]Because this would be 1, 8 guys.
[118:09.22]And then, this is, that's good.
[118:15.48]Now we need a mayor.
[118:17.82]One mayor, which is right here.
[118:19.04]FUUUUCK!
[118:23.24]Um, comic.
[118:27.62]Is this two comic?
[118:28.58]Or should I do two eight guys?
[118:30.43]This'll be two comic.
[118:40.29]Cover is all three.
[118:44.54]No, this is two comic.
[118:45.72]Two comic... We have two comic, one eight guys.
[118:52.76]Now this is mayor.
[118:55.61]That would be two comic, one eight guys, one mayor.
[118:57.67]Okay.
[119:03.75]And this is eight guys.
[119:05.75]This is...
[119:13.11]This is, this is eight guys, there'll be two eight guys?
[119:19.78]That'll be two comic, two eight guys.
[119:23.70]One mayor.
[119:26.95]Am I doing the same thing?
[119:27.77]Okay, that's two comic, two eight guys, one mayor.
[119:33.39]Now I need, um...
[119:40.90]Um, I need mayor.
[119:43.66]That'd be two, two.
[119:44.60]That'd be two, two, two.
[119:45.54]This would be two, two, two.
[119:50.33]This would be three guys.
[119:54.71]Three... This is... What is this?
[119:57.41]Two mayor now?
[120:00.39]And then putting this would be three guys, two mayor.
[120:06.80]Um... Eight, not three.
[120:12.64]This is one comic, one... I fucking wrote something down and I fucked it up.
[120:18.49]Right now I'm at 2-2-1.
[120:19.67]So this would be... I'm so confused.
[120:27.32]Does this count as two?
[120:30.66]Left brain logic.
[120:31.68]I'll dodge an axe if you swing it at me.
[120:41.27]I've lost.
[120:41.65]I'm lost.
[120:41.95]You know what?
[120:42.23]I gotta turn the music off.
[120:43.23]It's like literally fucking with my brain.
[120:44.99]Alright, music's off.
[120:46.68]We got 2-2-1 right now.
[120:49.74]This would be... 3-2-2.
[120:57.75]Right?
[120:58.19]3-2-2.
[120:58.29]3-2-2 if I put this here.
[121:00.27]I'm just fucking doing it.
[121:01.23]I don't care.
[121:01.67]I'll leave.
[121:02.25]I'm leaving if I don't get it right.
[121:03.35]3-2-2.
[121:03.73]That's 3 comic, 2 8 guys, 2 mayor.
[121:14.41]now I need this would be three mayor I just need one eight guys on the back and I'm done because that'll be three comic two eight guys three mayor that's it I just need a comic on the back and that's it right I just need just comic on the back is it not possible
[121:42.53]Comic is on the back of the eight guys.
[121:44.72]WHAT?!
[121:49.18]There are no comics on the back.
[121:50.54]There is none.
[121:53.40]So if I do this, this would be... I have to stop writing shit down before it happens.
[121:59.33]So this is comic... I'm just gonna look up the solution.
[122:05.97]All the backs are two topics.
[122:10.46]There are no comics for the back?
[122:14.30]So this would get us to three comic, right?
[122:20.22]Both mayor.
[122:21.60]No, don't do both mayor.
[122:23.06]What do I do?
[122:24.72]Comic now and then mayor.
[122:28.67]It's a comic and also eight guys.
[122:30.15]Is it?
[122:30.59]This is eight guys?
[122:31.39]No, it's not.
[122:31.67]It's a streaming thing.
[122:35.07]I'm just doing it.
[122:35.65]I don't care.
[122:36.45]And I'm literally not coming back.
[122:39.37]Okay.
[122:40.31]Two... Now I just need mayor...
[122:43.62]And that should be it, right?
[122:46.60]Right?
[122:49.26]Or do I need eight guys?
[122:51.66]Is this eight guys in the back?
[122:53.78]Is it?
[122:55.98]I did it, right?
[122:56.60]Yo!
[123:02.98]Let's show it to the editor for approval.
[123:12.94]Yeah, sure.
[123:15.02]We're good.
[123:19.18]What's going on?
[123:19.74]Alright, what I was going to say is Five Guys went up to S tier for me.
[123:28.55]Looks like we're all set to scan and send to the printers.
[123:34.06]I've recently had Five Guys, and it was way better than Shake Shack.
[123:40.26]I don't know what happened to Shake Shack, but holy shit, it fell off hard.
[123:44.65]So hard.
[123:46.75]You wanna know something fucked up?
[123:48.57]I was a Shake Shack fan.
[123:50.11]I was an absolute Shake Shack maniac.
[123:53.83]I've had it a few times, and holy shit, it fell the fuck off so bad.
[124:01.26]The last time I've ordered Shake Shack, the burger's been, like, not good.
[124:04.42]It's like, the texture really has been weird.
[124:08.08]And if you get lettuce on a Shake Shack burger, this is just my, this is what's happened to me the last few times.
[124:13.83]This might not be your experience, but holy shit, it's been mine.
[124:17.05]Dude, the lettuce is like one tiny little joke piece of wilted, like, wet, gross lettuce like this.
[124:24.30]It was dog shit.
[124:26.54]Dog shit.
[124:27.84]I'm not kidding, it was dog shit.
[124:30.78]If you open the bun of a recent Shake Shack burger, it fucking looks like this.
[124:36.32]And it's one tiny little pathetic piece, yeah.
[124:40.22]I had a Five Guys burger.
[124:43.90]The lettuce was fucking big and crispy.
[124:45.92]There was a tomato.
[124:46.84]It was a big, thick, delicious tomato.
[124:49.04]The burger was cooked perfectly.
[124:50.46]I have to amend the fast food tier list.
[124:53.89]Shake Shack literally went down to like a B. Maybe even lower.
[124:57.57]It sucked.
[124:58.87]Literally was my favorite place.
[125:02.59]I'm sorry.
[125:03.31]Like, you know I'm not a bullshitter.
[125:05.95]It was up at S tier.
[125:08.38]But why was there tomato on it?
[125:09.92]I just felt like it one day.
[125:11.08]I know, tomato's gross.
[125:12.50]I just felt like it.
[125:13.20]It was good.
[125:14.36]I felt like it.
[125:15.32]I felt like it.
[125:15.80]You fell off.
[125:16.34]Shut up.
[125:17.93]I felt like it today.
[125:18.71]I didn't eat it today.
[125:20.29]You know what I mean?
[125:20.81]I felt like it, like, recently.
[125:22.09]I just felt like eating a tomato on my burger.
[125:23.77]I felt like it.
[125:27.41]I had to test to see how juicy and firm and crispy it was, you know what I mean?
[125:31.97]I had to test it.
[125:33.73]Because if you're lettuce, if you're vegetables, I gotta check and see that, because that's important.
[125:38.81]I don't like lettuce, uh, tomato on a hamburger, but I had to try to see how it was.
[125:41.93]It was crispy and it was juicy and watery and delicious.
[125:45.51]Calm the fuck down, dude.
[125:57.75]Oh, that's a pretty rad tagline.
[125:58.99]If I had a public assets channel talk show, which is 100% of the cards, by the way, if I keep a B+, second term, that would definitely be my sassy catchphrase.
[126:07.19]Anyways, the event is a gross allocation of funds if you want my opinion.
[126:12.01]I'm fine.
[126:12.93]Calm down.
[126:13.41]What are you talking about?
[126:15.83]You know that helium is a finite resource?
[126:17.63]Seriously, I'll Google it.
[126:19.57]Every balloon, it's a party.
[126:22.05]Every balloon at that shindig is basically a big heck off to the folks that really need it.
[126:27.48]Like scientists and clowns that are down on their luck but have hopeful hearts.
[126:31.54]I'll see you there tonight, comrade.
[126:32.86]Bring your favorite safety pin covered.
[126:34.90]Gene best for righteous popping.
[126:43.05]Yep.
[126:44.19]Five Guys really took over.
[126:49.87]I feel like I was kind of unfair to Five Guys.
[126:52.55]Because when you order a Five Guys burger and you get fries, they just dump fries in the bag.
[126:59.12]It's like a joke.
[127:00.42]They just put like five servings worth in the bag.
[127:04.08]And they're kind of like messy and shit.
[127:05.62]And they're a little greasy for me.
[127:08.18]But the burgers... It went up to Esther.
[127:12.69]I have to be honest.
[127:13.47]I'm sorry.
[127:13.79]Alright, we got it.
[127:16.17]We got the puzzle piece.
[127:18.71]Hello!
[127:20.56]Hello, hello, hello.
[127:22.62]Hey.
[127:25.06]Oh, hello.
[127:26.68]We're the Downtown Quartet, and we'll sing you a song.
[127:29.46]Not a very short one, but it also ain't long.
[127:32.17]We'll sing it in the morning, and we'll sing it past noon.
[127:34.89]We've had a lot of noise complaints, and we'll be gone soon.
[127:37.55]Hit the solo, Maurice.
[127:41.35]To jail.
[127:46.41]We can't tell you much, but we'll sing like a bird.
[127:51.29]That didn't rhyme.
[127:52.70]Oh, baby, I'm not related to Pat.
[127:53.86]No, nothing like that.
[127:54.66]I'm just a guy they know that takes part of the show.
[127:57.40]Oh, oh.
[127:58.80]Oh, dude, pull it back.
[127:59.52]Sorry.
[128:01.13]Okay.
[128:14.28]Denise.
[128:15.32]Luis.
[128:15.66]Patrice.
[128:17.60]Maurice.
[128:17.96]Are we gonna sing a song?
[128:21.62]If you can help us with our act, we'll tell you all that we heard.
[128:24.06]Okay.
[128:26.59]Barbershop upset.
[128:27.91]Play.
[128:28.37]Give them a solo without triggering an oh no.
[128:33.97]Help the alligator quartet hit their solos.
[128:35.69]When the scrolling bar shows a singer's background, point the spotlight at them.
[128:41.11]Sounds easy enough.
[128:43.87]Womp up our vocal cords.
[128:45.47]Keep an eye on the scrolling bar at the bottom.
[128:46.71]Shine the spotlight at the singer with a matching background.
[128:50.56]When the groovy disco pattern appears, shine the spotlight at the disco ball and we'll all sing together.
[128:55.00]Ready, gentlemen?
[128:56.32]Ready, maestro?
[128:57.60]What?
[129:13.85]Hey!
[129:19.55]What's going on?
[129:20.21]Oh, disco ball.
[129:23.98]I failed.
[129:28.76]Oops.
[129:36.98]I didn't get it.
[129:37.60]I didn't know what they wanted me to do.
[129:38.78]I didn't, I didn't, I didn't get it.
[129:40.78]I didn't get it.
[129:41.98]I get it now.
[129:43.42]I didn't get it.
[129:43.88]Okay, here we go, here we go.
[130:01.01]Why are you so pissed?
[130:02.71]I'm doing it right!
[130:24.76]I got it right!
[130:25.40]What are you talking about?
[130:26.88]This lady's not very good.
[130:28.38]Say, that felt pretty good.
[130:29.28]What do you think, fellas?
[130:30.92]Not enough Patrice time.
[130:32.00]Patrice demands more solo time.
[130:33.56]Okay, one more time for Patrice.
[130:37.88]He's actually colorblind?
[130:38.98]No, I'm not?
[130:39.65]What are you talking about?
[130:41.29]What are you talking about?
[130:46.93]Did I get it wrong?
[130:52.51]What are you talking about?
[130:53.59]That's correct!
[130:58.86]What's happening?
[130:59.78]Am I stupid?
[131:01.34]Am I stupid?
[131:02.04]What's happening?
[131:15.37]What's happening?
[131:17.37]He's throwing.
[131:18.49]I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
[131:21.73]We could have had more timber.
[131:24.32]Come on.
[131:24.74]It's a singing word.
[131:26.86]I'm a real singer, and I'm going to prove it.
[131:28.96]Okay, last time.
[131:31.00]Alright, everyone, give it everything you got.
[131:54.11]That's right!
[132:01.76]She just sounds bad.
[132:02.94]Like, that's not my problem.
[132:04.78]You just sound bad.
[132:05.52]I got it.
[132:13.90]Free school level cover knot.
[132:15.18]I thought I did it right.
[132:16.00]You guys are just fucked up.
[132:19.34]Got it.
[132:25.37]All of them.
[132:32.67]I did it.
[132:34.31]Come on, man.
[132:35.79]Oh, right.
[132:36.17]Sorry.
[132:37.61]Oh, here we go.
[132:41.38]This game's cute.
[133:00.01]Hello, hello, your pal at the city, Aficionado, here.
[133:02.11]Just want to make sure you know about this cool local place called Nana Rue's Antiques.
[133:07.70]I'm already there.
[133:09.36]I know what you're thinking.
[133:10.10]Antiques are for grandmas.
[133:12.32]And you're right.
[133:12.98]The whole shop is run by a grandma.
[133:14.36]Well, a nana, Nana Rue.
[133:17.00]There's a great local legend about the place that it's super haunted by, like, five billion ghosts.
[133:23.23]What's really haunting, though, is the prices.
[133:24.67]This is awful.
[133:26.57]Ha.
[133:30.76]oof there's a little shopping humor from me to you I'm not really rolling on the floor anyway nenaru is a much of a card shark as she is a deal shark so be careful if you have time defo check out her colorful shop it's tons of fun you're right we're here now check it out
[133:57.22]I used to be a porcelain doll, but I came to life because of this magic shop.
[134:00.46]At least that's what I tell my ex-wife so I can come sit here all day.
[134:05.20]I've got a good butt groove going on in this shelf.
[134:12.42]You're late.
[134:12.78]I've been waiting for you for an hour.
[134:14.08]What do you mean you don't work here?
[134:17.81]Well, it's not as if you can fault me for thinking so, but with a drab wardrobe and pathetic sunken eyes.
[134:23.89]Everything here is the clear stink of death upon it.
[134:28.64]Oh, except for me, of course.
[134:32.24]Oh, I can't even imagine attending the event, unchaperoned.
[134:45.07]Only my poor, dear husband had been less poisoned.
[134:48.23]I wouldn't have to suffer such horrific indignities.
[134:51.78]Will no one think of me and my feelings?
[134:56.98]I'm merely a lonely widow, left behind for the great beyond by my beloved late husband Horus.
[135:02.73]Oh Horus, such a... always such a wonderful wisp of a man.
[135:07.75]Even at his most poisoned, he forever remained regal, kind, and absurdly wealthy.
[135:13.08]Now in his absence, I find myself trying to take comfort in the metaphysical arts.
[135:17.68]If only I could hear his sweet, strained voice once more.
[135:20.86]Lady's fucked.
[135:25.14]Oh, Pat, you mean the one with the ridiculous hat?
[135:27.52]Yes, I'm aware of him.
[135:29.14]Terrible stain on the bloodline.
[135:31.24]That Papooli fellow.
[135:33.33]Created all sorts of nonsensical cousins for myself and my dear children.
[135:37.81]Though it's a little comfort to me.
[135:40.79]Okay.
[135:42.37]I fucking can't read.
[136:07.82]How dare you!
[136:08.72]I've had no rest for the past week!
[136:11.24]Whenever I close my eyes, I am visited by Horus's specter, reaching out to me.
[136:16.51]Perhaps trying to send me information about some secret treasure he wanted me to inherit on top of the rest of his vast estate.
[136:23.87]Will nothing stop his ceaseless haunting?
[136:25.69]If I had any heart to help this poor widow, I can give you the information you seek.
[136:30.26]Just use the spirit board to contact Horus and please find out what my dear late husband wants or what kind of evidence he has.
[136:38.53]You got it.
[136:43.35]Follow the ghost through the eye of the planchette.
[136:46.47]It could get tricky.
[136:48.05]The faster you move, the more suspicious the widow gets.
[136:52.28]Okay.
[136:57.86]Prove me you can contact my beloved late husband or I shall out you as a charlatan to the entire Mean Ladies Bridge Club.
[137:09.33]Which one of them?
[137:09.81]Where's the husband?
[137:19.07]Wait, what does her husband look like?
[137:20.70]I don't remember.
[137:21.08]What does your husband look like?
[137:31.96]Is that him?
[137:38.18]That's him.
[137:48.21]Where is this guy?
[137:48.95]It does seem like my horse.
[138:10.13]Perhaps it really could be him.
[138:15.49]I get the suspicion bar, right?
[138:18.03]Suspension bar.
[138:18.49]Got him.
[138:37.99]Got it.
[138:49.47]Dude, are you a sus guy?
[138:53.03]Yeah.
[138:55.81]I'll be at Comic Con next year.
[138:57.83]I have a booth, a sus booth.
[138:59.39]And I'll be like shaking everybody's hand and stuff.
[139:07.55]Oh!
[139:17.10]I got it!
[139:19.69]This- No, I'm not- I'm kidding!
[139:21.15]That's a joke.
[139:31.76]That's a joke!
[139:35.43]I gotta pee and I want some more green tea.
[139:38.39]Hey, hey, hey!
[139:39.65]Can I get you anything?
[139:40.75]Well, I'm up.
[139:41.47]Can I get you something?
[139:43.09]Hey, can I- Hey, hey!
[139:44.25]Can I get you something?
[139:46.77]Alright, so how many people have I met?
[139:51.91]I must go tell the children at once, and also hide some sensitive items in the toilet paper.
[139:55.79]Perhaps.
[139:56.73]Wait, I read that.
[139:57.59]I just read that.
[139:58.35]That was my dream.
[139:59.90]I simply don't have any more time to discuss the event with you today.
[140:02.62]Farewell, my medium.
[140:03.56]Alright, what about you?
[140:09.50]You have something to do?
[140:11.24]Welcome to Nanneroo's, where if there's ooze on your shoes, it's just because of the booze.
[140:15.21]It's haunted as all get-out in here, sweetheart, so mind the ectoplasm.
[140:19.48]Who are you?
[140:44.84]Well, Sugar Pie, as the sign may have alerted you, I'm the one and only Nana Rue herself.
[140:49.79]Purveyor of only the finest antique goods and the finest antique store owners.
[140:55.61]Come on, honey.
[140:56.09]Tell me I'm looking good for my age.
[140:58.83]Alice, stop harassing the customers.
[141:02.82]My sweet, sweet Patrick.
[141:04.00]He's my absolute shortest grandson.
[141:06.70]Why, it feels only like yesterday.
[141:08.74]He would run about the shop squealing about ghosts trying to eat his kidneys and hiding in humorously oversized vases.
[141:14.96]As you can probably tell by my expression, that actually was yesterday.
[141:20.15]You guys are wicked funny.
[141:32.59]That boy might not be playing with a full deck.
[141:35.31]Hey, hey, you be careful with that vase.
[141:36.61]It's expensive.
[141:41.00]Oh, so Pat's inviting his little friends to the event.
[141:42.90]Isn't that cute?
[141:43.48]He's such a darling, that boy.
[141:44.76]I'll be closing the shop early to get over there on time tonight.
[141:47.06]Gotta strain all the ghosts out of my wig before the shindig.
[141:51.58]You know, those things that tend to hide.
[141:54.08]They hitch a ride.
[141:57.70]BatChest.
[142:00.99]Dude, play the game.
[142:06.82]I'm doing that!
[142:07.92]I'm doing that!
[142:09.39]What?
[142:09.59]I just stopped for a second to look over here.
[142:12.61]It was one mo- Okay, it was like... It was like one full second.
[142:18.01]You had to- It took you- You typed that while I was playing it.
[142:21.19]It took me- It took you longer to type that sentence.
[142:24.13]He's gonna get stunlocked.
[142:25.01]No, I'm not.
[142:26.92]No, I'm not.
[142:27.68]I'm trinketing out of this conversation.
[142:33.89]Sorry, Pumpkin.
[142:34.69]Looks like I have to stop yapping about the event and take care of a customer.
[142:40.18]Unless you defeat me at a round of cards.
[142:41.62]What do you say?
[142:42.34]Let's do it, yeah.
[142:47.04]How do you play Old Maid?
[142:51.40]On your turn, click to take one of Nanabru's cards.
[142:54.46]Then, she'll take one from you.
[142:56.06]Any matching pairs will be removed.
[142:57.32]The player left holding the Old Maid loses.
[143:07.79]How do you play this?
[143:08.49]Let's go fish?
[143:09.59]Ooh!
[143:21.92]So I gotta say, we gotta get carrots.
[143:35.75]I'll get you next turn, I know it.
[143:36.83]You seem nervous.
[143:41.77]Wha- do we have the same cards?
[143:52.74]But what if she- what if she- am I gonna lose?
[143:54.48]Or do I win?
[143:57.23]The universe wanted me to make a pair, so now what?
[144:00.47]Oh, I won!
[144:03.07]Oh, that was easy!
[144:07.71]That was easy.
[144:08.59]I win.
[144:12.35]You beat me fair and square.
[144:14.13]Holy shit.
[144:19.14]Look at his mod chat for a second.
[144:21.40]Grandma had another dream.
[144:22.32]Uh, oh dear.
[144:25.40]Perhaps it's one of the worst stories he has ever shared on stream.
[144:34.20]Was it though?
[144:37.01]Alright, you've seen my older sister Constance around.
[144:38.65]You should try to coerce her into playing around with you.
[144:40.97]With a doll like you.
[144:42.61]You get a real kick out of it.
[144:45.63]I had to warn another mod about it.
[144:49.89]Was it bad?
[144:50.41]How was it bad?
[144:54.55]Get there at 8 sharp.
[144:55.43]Okay.
[145:00.37]Something will get knocked, the boy.
[145:02.77]Something will get knocked off the boy.
[145:05.07]We'll make sure of it.
[145:05.81]D'wah!
[145:14.25]Hey, it's me again, Pat.
[145:15.73]It's almost 4 and I could really use your help.
[145:17.77]Oh shit, it's almost 8.
[145:19.81]We stopped this at 8.
[145:20.41]Do I have to do something before 8?
[145:22.21]Do you know anything about shoes?
[145:28.31]And the wearing of them?
[145:30.61]Yeah?
[145:31.45]Perfect.
[145:31.97]Could you come meet me at my hotel room?
[145:34.73]Just make sure you aren't followed by any shifty characters.
[145:37.73]Or college age canvassers in cargo shorts.
[145:43.67]They gave me gas.
[145:45.41]I already gave all my dollar bills to that guy pretending to be a statue outside 4th Street.
[145:51.54]I'm on my way.
[145:53.56]With the blood?
[146:01.04]Jesus Christ.
[146:04.88]I want to know that guy's story.
[146:16.14]Good evening to you, fellow traveler.
[146:17.38]Have you come to imbibe some ales after your long journey as well?
[146:22.82]Carcon, fetch us your finest novelty wine based on a popular sci-fi television show.
[146:29.62]Nice suit.
[146:30.10]I like dabbling in a little bit of cosplay myself.
[146:33.96]By just last year at Alligator Comic Con, I dressed as a character of my own creation, Darylus, Great Wizard of the North.
[146:40.78]My brother Mickey helped me put it together, though he did get it a bit slimy.
[146:48.95]Yeah, it's a party.
[146:51.37]What, am I not supposed to say that?
[146:55.76]I'm telling him it was you.
[147:00.56]Pat is my second cousin, as well as my second favorite person to play Dungeons & Dragons with.
[147:05.06]First being my internet friend Carl, whose dad got rich bytecoin mining.
[147:10.82]Pat's a bard, so you know, pretty party useless.
[147:15.08]Great singing voice though, he can really wail on that juice harp.
[147:22.70]I'm Derry, known as the Terror of the East Side in most magics.
[147:26.36]Happening card game circles.
[147:28.62]On campus, I'm known as the Terror of the AP Bio Lab, or the one with that haircut.
[147:36.11]Bald coin is still an emote.
[147:37.81]Wow.
[147:38.83]It's still there.
[147:39.37]I never deleted it.
[147:39.87]Okay.
[147:44.55]You're leaving already?
[147:45.21]Safe travels, my fellow traverser of the mortal plane.
[147:48.76]Perhaps we will meet again in another realm, or on an internet forum for roleplaying.
[147:54.54]What are you doing over here?
[147:56.40]Hello, esteemed guest.
[147:57.16]Mr. Pat asked me to inform you to come straight to his hotel room upon arrival.
[148:04.24]Can you update your emotes?
[148:14.61]I don't know.
[148:15.19]I mean, I... I haven't updated my, like, paid sub emotes in, like, three years.
[148:20.22]Yeah.
[148:22.82]Yeah.
[148:24.25]It's true.
[148:25.95]Okay, let's go.
[148:26.45]I want you to knock first in case he was wearing pants.
[148:31.95]Alright.
[148:32.73]Okay.
[148:39.96]I can drag this hallway.
[148:45.22]Oh my, how embarrassing.
[148:46.00]Please don't tell the internet.
[148:47.34]We've had a biohazard internet again.
[148:49.34]I can't read.
[148:57.40]Okay, thanks for your patience, esteemed guest.
[148:58.58]We've now arrived.
[149:01.21]Mr. Pat is expecting you.
[149:02.19]Please just knock in case he's... Have a Johnny of a day.
[149:09.92]Welcome back.
[149:10.44]I was just trying on some... Nothing.
[149:12.80]I wasn't doing anything, actually.
[149:13.88]Have you talked to more of my family?
[149:15.90]Found out any secret...
[149:18.73]If you guys want to hear the best cat puke sounds, those ASMR eating mukbang videos.
[149:22.17]I don't know what it is about these.
[149:24.09]I watch a lot of stuff, right?
[149:46.76]But they'll, they drink, usually they drink like a big soda.
[149:51.80]At the very beginning.
[149:52.84]They'll always drink a huge soda.
[149:55.10]Like, oh, well, today, before I eat this big meal, I'm gonna drink a giant, I'm gonna drink a huge soda.
[149:59.96]And it's just like, it sounds like the microphone is inside of their throat.
[150:03.82]It's just like, cat puke, cat puke, cat puke.
[150:06.59]And I say cat puke every time.
[150:09.31]Please, -2.
[150:10.91]I don't watch these every day.
[150:12.01]I'm just saying, like, that's where you can find the best cat puke.
[150:15.10]Like you would want to find them.
[150:16.60]I don't know.
[150:16.94]I don't know.
[150:21.40]What do you mean stop?
[150:22.38]What?
[150:22.60]What's wrong with you?
[150:28.87]Mods.
[150:29.33]Deal with this guy.
[150:30.17]Mods.
[150:30.43]Deal with him.
[150:30.75]You lost 500 viewers for that.
[150:32.03]I didn't lose 500 viewers for that.
[150:33.23]I lost 500 viewers because I'm playing a puzzle game.
[150:37.77]Jerma is disgusting today.
[150:39.15]I'm just telling... I'm telling... What?
[150:40.72]Alright.
[150:42.80]Well, I say it sometimes.
[150:43.96]Like once a year.
[150:46.31]What?
[150:52.55]Stop reading the one, guys.
[150:54.08]Huh?
[150:54.16]You're gonna make me throw up.
[150:58.72]I just said that if you watch those eating videos, they have cat puke sounds.
[151:03.91]What?
[151:04.23]I'm not allowed to have an observation about video content I've seen at some point in my adult life?
[151:11.59]You know what's fun?
[151:12.17]There's no don't and nevermind.
[151:14.41]I say I always fall asleep with autoplay on and when I wake up, I see what's there.
[151:17.64]I don't know.
[151:19.80]I don't know.
[151:20.42]It's like weird.
[151:24.52]Like I would love to just kind of be like, you know, let's see what we get.
[151:27.25]And then I'll open up like I'll have my iPad usually sitting right there and there'll be something playing.
[151:33.68]Sometimes I wake up to cat pukes.
[151:35.02]I wake up to, like, the, like, eating videos, and I'm just like, what's that?
[151:39.18]Oh, that's where we are!
[151:40.34]And I go back to bed.
[151:45.73]It's kind of like a mystery.
[151:46.71]You don't know what's gonna happen.
[151:50.17]In the meantime, though, I actually called you back here because I needed your help.
[151:53.11]It's no different than leaving the tea-
[151:59.19]let me ask you a question do you guys leave the TV on in the hotel room you guys fall asleep to the TV how's that different you don't like put the TV on to fall asleep to the TV on some random channel and just you don't even know what's gonna be on there it's gonna play what do you mean no zoomers don't do that
[152:27.94]Am I out of my- am I out of my fucking mind?
[152:30.30]People don't, like, leave the TV on to sleep to some- like, a lot of time?
[152:43.61]Paulie said, the last two weeks he's almost made us puke twice from nasty food videos!
[152:50.89]Alright, listen, I almost puked last night because I was watching this video and this guy ate such a gross thing.
[152:59.14]That's real, yeah.
[153:02.28]I almost puked last night.
[153:03.28]I almost puked for one second because when I say we were watching, I was watching.
[153:08.88]I don't know.
[153:11.14]I want to have tons of knowledge up here.
[153:13.84]I want to be informed about everything.
[153:15.94]You know what I mean?
[153:17.40]So like food videos and Halloween conventions and infomercials.
[153:23.69]I want to be all-knowing.
[153:25.59]I have to be all-knowing.
[153:28.87]I need to know everything, you know what I mean?
[153:30.90]Like, I need to know about all these subjects.
[153:34.00]I just need to, like, absorb them.
[153:35.96]Sir Gideon.
[153:37.92]I don't know.
[153:40.64]A shoe-related problem.
[153:42.40]I don't usually wear them, but I figured if I did tonight, maybe I'd have a better look at it.
[153:45.29]Haunt footed out of the event safely.
[153:49.85]So sometimes, when you want to be all-knowing...
[153:53.04]You might watch a video where like a guy's like eating like a big like thing covered in cheese and makes you almost puke.
[153:58.38]And you go, alright, I don't want to see it.
[153:59.60]I'm done with that.
[154:00.18]I have that knowledge now.
[154:01.18]I don't want any more.
[154:02.02]The loathsome cat puker.
[154:17.57]The issue isn't my usual shoe.
[154:19.07]Alright, let's move on.
[154:21.71]What?
[154:23.48]What's the weirdest infomercial you've ever seen?
[154:29.23]Infomercials aren't usually weird.
[154:30.43]They're just kind of background noise.
[154:31.89]Okay.
[154:35.25]Last week by Nanaru gifted me an antique arm war from her shop as an early birthday present.
[154:44.60]Turn your noise gate up higher.
[154:45.58]I heard the fart.
[154:46.82]Stop it.
[154:48.38]It's a big, spacious practical, and so super haunted that it's leaving a weird stain on the park... way?
[154:55.61]Flooring?
[154:56.23]Just by existing?
[154:58.27]I haven't been able to find any of my shoes in whenever I open a drawer.
[155:01.33]Weird stuff happens.
[155:02.61]Why don't you see for yourself?
[155:03.51]Okay.
[155:08.91]Peruse for shoes.
[155:10.71]Find a pair of Pat's favorite shoes by clicking on those suspicious draws.
[155:14.75]Be careful if Pat gets too scared.
[155:16.52]He'll give up on shoes forever.
[155:19.02]After each round, the contents of the draws will shuffle around spooky.
[155:22.88]I can't believe in this generation of people that consume media all day that I'm the weird guy for watching TV at night.
[155:32.45]Huh?
[155:32.73]Huh?
[155:36.83]Huh?
[155:39.36]Help me find my shoes player.
[155:40.44]Let's go.
[155:49.00]Got it.
[155:50.30]That's a shoe.
[155:59.37]No, that's not a shoe.
[156:00.03]That's a sandal, right?
[156:11.09]Gross stuff.
[156:12.35]Ugh.
[156:15.66]Second choup.
[156:23.80]Oops.
[156:28.81]It's a matching game?
[156:33.63]You don't think I... Relax.
[156:36.03]Choup!
[156:44.86]Game Boy Advance!
[156:45.56]There's a second one!
[156:52.61]Wait, what?
[156:53.99]What the fuck was that?
[156:59.09]Choo!
[157:02.45]Oh, it wants me to do it in succession!
[157:05.52]Oh, okay, I, I, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[157:10.08]That, where's that one?
[157:13.96]That one was like over here somewhere.
[157:16.26]I don't remember.
[157:17.82]I didn't know it was in- Okay, wait.
[157:19.26]So where's the other one?
[157:21.72]Where's this one right here?
[157:22.40]I don't- Where's this?
[157:25.46]I don't fucking know.
[157:28.26]I- Okay, here.
[157:31.28]This one right here.
[157:32.99]I didn't know that's what that- Usually it would stay open.
[157:35.37]In a memory game, they would stay open.
[157:37.07]It'd be like, I'll find the other one.
[157:37.97]It stays open.
[157:41.17]I- Look, I get it now.
[157:43.74]Start timing people out for a YEAR if they continue to be mean to me.
[157:47.40]Okay.
[157:50.78]That's top left.
[157:52.38]Alright.
[157:54.22]Okay.
[157:56.42]Bingo.
[158:03.87]See, I thought usually in a memory game the card stays flipped over, the thing stays out.
[158:20.14]A year?
[158:20.58]What a tyrant.
[158:25.97]Where's the shoes?
[158:29.69]No.
[158:32.89]No!
[158:36.37]Where's the shoe?
[158:43.39]Okay, there's one.
[158:46.03]Right below it?
[158:51.51]Pick the same one again.
[158:52.37]That's not how it works.
[158:54.37]I got it, I'm fine.
[158:54.87]You got all pairs of shoes.
[159:12.28]Go bear flipper like I usually do.
[159:14.66]Sorry, I'm just so nervous.
[159:15.56]I'm not thinking straight.
[159:16.74]Sorry I made you come back here for nothing, but I really appreciate that you did.
[159:21.10]Alright, oh jeez.
[159:23.74]I'm so glad we met today.
[159:24.64]You're the best pal I've had in a long time.
[159:26.82]See, I'm getting all mushy.
[159:28.72]You get back out there and dig up some more dirt.
[159:32.44]We only have a little bit more time.
[159:33.54]Onion ring?
[159:43.29]Uno giorno, city pal here.
[159:46.03]Did you know that's how they say hello in Italy?
[159:49.47]At least that's how... what it said on the back of my crisp riceys box today.
[159:54.17]Let's see.
[159:57.09]There's a lot of different alligators from all over the world here in Alligator New York City.
[160:00.47]That's why they call it a melting pot.
[160:02.79]Not because of that strange smell the sidewalk gives off in hot weather as I originally thought.
[160:08.95]If you want to meet any interesting people during your stay, maybe you should start on the trolley since everyone uses it.
[160:14.42]You never know who you might strike up a conversation with out there.
[160:18.22]Or who might throw a bag of hair at you and then run away.
[160:21.06]That's the big city for you, full of surprises.
[160:23.74]A bag of hair?
[160:35.96]Okay.
[160:36.10]Where have we not been to?
[160:37.83]How about the, um, the unsavory part of town?
[160:42.73]Go ahead.
[160:46.97]This weirdo again.
[160:51.73]Hey, did you say something?
[160:54.64]I see you over there eyeing my cards, young'un.
[160:57.22]But I ain't giving them to you.
[160:58.82]Last time I was giving cards away was long before you were born.
[161:02.90]And now look at me.
[161:03.58]I'm old.
[161:05.67]See what Sharon gets you, aging irreparably.
[161:09.43]One day your skin is sucked close to your skeleton, and then you turn around, and boom.
[161:14.13]Your jowls are hanging down past your collarbone, which are now hollow inside.
[161:18.81]Is that what you want?
[161:22.31]Hollow collarbones with a nest of daddy long legs inside?
[161:25.30]Then stop staring at my card.
[161:30.30]Moisturize every day.
[161:33.58]Get a good just light face moisturizer and do it.
[161:38.65]If you do it every day after you get out of the shower, dry off.
[161:42.61]You'll look like this.
[161:49.61]I ain't telling you a kid like you nothing.
[161:51.58]I have acne?
[161:59.12]There's one right here.
[162:01.97]Look, you're going to get little pimples and stuff.
[162:06.47]Did Pat tell you to go steal his great aunt's cards?
[162:08.63]Because if he did, I ain't going to give him his Christmas present this year.
[162:15.80]Which, of course, is a bag of oranges and a strange tin of popcorn from 1987.
[162:18.50]About 1985, when Super Mario came out.
[162:29.33]That's only the business of me and the nurse that puts the ointment on my back bees three times a week.
[162:36.87]Stop staring at my cards.
[162:40.26]Although you can play me for the information as long as you don't stare at my cards.
[162:44.22]What do you say, kiddo?
[162:44.92]Think you can beat the old maid?
[162:47.02]That's right.
[162:56.07]Okay.
[162:56.29]So this is the thing before was the tutorial for this.
[163:00.50]Beauty before age, my dear.
[163:01.68]You go first.
[163:02.18]Play cards like an old lady.
[163:03.66]I was going right in the middle.
[163:09.15]A 10?
[163:11.21]How was that not a 10?
[163:11.85]You just took the same card back.
[163:19.23]Wait, that was the old maid?
[163:20.47]Here we go.
[163:28.35]I won't lose.
[163:28.87]I can pick cards in my sleep.
[163:34.38]Sometimes it feels like the pears want to find me.
[163:36.22]Left.
[163:42.66]That's the Old Maid.
[163:43.24]Alright, so I just have to end up with the Old Maid, right?
[163:46.38]Good.
[163:59.19]Queens?
[164:01.47]No, you don't want the Old Maid.
[164:06.49]Take the old maid.
[164:06.99]Oh, fuck.
[164:09.99]Okay.
[164:12.89]Hopefully this is 10.
[164:15.30]Oh, no.
[164:15.72]Did I lose?
[164:20.04]Oh.
[164:20.34]Go home with the tail between your legs, baby.
[164:28.66]Maybe your mummy will wipe the tears off your snoot.
[164:31.20]Haha.
[164:36.51]Can't retry it.
[164:42.24]That's just RNG.
[164:43.12]You can't be, like, good at that game.
[164:45.22]Hey, buddy, your good old guide here.
[164:47.34]Oh my god, I just, like, scratched your eyes.
[164:49.28]I just wanted to warn you in a big city.
[164:52.40]In a city so big, there are bound to be parts that are a little seedy.
[164:55.04]Fucking seedy tough guys.
[164:57.31]Seedy tough guys who eat the seeds of things without spitting them out on a napkin politely.
[165:03.13]Be careful.
[165:04.39]Don't go clicking around in back alleys or anything.
[165:06.79]You never know what you might find.
[165:09.79]Is there a GPS on my phone?
[165:11.95]Why do you know I'm here?
[165:12.47]Hey, what are you looking at?
[165:20.77]Trying to listen to our exceedingly private rooftop conversation?
[165:25.43]Beat it, creep!
[165:31.76]Hey, you got a light?
[165:33.14]No, not for my cigarette.
[165:34.28]I mean in general.
[165:35.06]It's kinda dark out here and I've got a spooky ghost allergy.
[165:38.08]You ain't seen any, right?
[165:42.25]I say, you there, vagrant.
[165:45.92]Brother, I don't think that they're a vagrant.
[165:47.60]They've got that suit on.
[165:49.28]Perhaps a hobo king.
[165:52.00]Hmm, you may be right, sister.
[165:54.20]You there, hobo king, come here a moment.
[165:57.19]Honestly, brother, what are we even doing in this filthy part of town?
[166:00.45]Even breathing the air outside this seedy watering hole is making my scales lose their highly regarded luster.
[166:06.03]I agree, sister, but you know as well as I that we had to find an unbiased bonehead for our beneficiary.
[166:12.73]So anyone at the estate was out.
[166:14.97]Besides, you know how weary I grow of literally everyone we know in the whole world.
[166:20.01]Shall we talk to the stranger with the briefcase then?
[166:22.71]Yes, yes, as long as it's not someone that gives me the dreadful horror of being known.
[166:25.97]Hey guys, what do you know about the event?
[166:30.05]Well, now you're going to have to be more specific.
[166:32.05]I attend lots of events, you know.
[166:34.68]Balls, galas, exhibitions, princes, and fortunate performance art shows.
[166:38.40]If you're speaking of last week when I walked the runway for Gil's fashion fishery rubbery pants for moist alligators, I'll have you know I got a write-up in the magazine spread for highlights for children.
[166:49.15]Anyway, if you're talking about tonight, we have no qualms spilling the whole secret to you.
[166:53.43]That is, if only you'd do us the smallest of favors.
[166:58.23]Do you guys know who Pat is?
[167:00.11]Pat?
[167:00.69]Why, he's our second cousin.
[167:02.88]That's like a cousin, but thankfully a little more removed from your gene pool.
[167:08.26]The amount of DNA shared between us is blessedly on the shallow side, much like your personality system.
[167:13.94]Oh, Prince, you're such a cut-up.
[167:18.87]Much like how I cut up your invitation to the Met Gala this year and fed it to the cat.
[167:23.19]What?
[167:23.91]But the theme this year was the Monopoly mascot.
[167:26.51]And you know Mittens III is on a strict diet for her failing kidneys.
[167:33.00]Brother, this nobody doesn't seem to be aware of who we are.
[167:36.76]Bless you.
[167:37.78]Indeed, sister.
[167:39.10]Perhaps with that pinstripe style, they've spent the last 30 or so years locked in a storage closet with their fingers in their ears.
[167:48.18]And their other fingers in their eyes.
[167:52.06]And fingers yet still in their nose.
[167:55.55]Obviously, since I released that perfume this year.
[167:58.57]Obviously.
[168:00.01]I am Princess Valentino, heir to the Valentino fortune.
[168:03.27]And this is my brother, Prince Valentino.
[168:05.49]He's also the heir since we're twins.
[168:07.99]I'm the evil twin.
[168:09.65]They couldn't... Does it look weird when I do this on camera?
[168:12.34]They couldn't test for that gene.
[168:14.52]And you know it, Prince.
[168:19.36]You see, our beloved daddy passed away just recently from poison-related complications.
[168:24.14]You know, the natural way.
[168:26.29]We're splitting up our shared inheritance, but we could really use a mediator.
[168:30.44]And someone to protect my beautiful face from dearest sister's punches.
[168:34.64]It's true, I punch super duper hard.
[168:37.94]If only we had some help dividing up daddy's precious possessions.
[168:41.79]I'm sure we could tell you the information you seek.
[168:45.03]So will you help us, or do you have hobo king duties to attend to?
[168:53.40]We need you, I'm here.
[168:55.82]Use the checklist to assign an item to each of the Valentino twins.
[168:59.20]Can't leave until both twins are happy.
[169:00.76]Pay attention to the indicator bar.
[169:02.99]Okay.
[169:06.27]Okay.
[169:07.49]Let's get on with this.
[169:08.47]Daddy's not getting any more alive.
[169:10.13]I'm already bored.
[169:15.05]Um... Okay.
[169:18.53]How do I... The Inherit... The Valentino Inherit... I almost said... Whatever.
[169:26.30]minks okay armor who's that go to alright I gotta get these right the armor is gonna go to you shiny damaged and empty well it wouldn't be totally out of place with me I suppose you take the mink stall too oh cozy just the kind of thing I like woman may throw the suffering of another you're gonna have to have
[169:55.14]Ah, the secret society hat.
[169:56.64]I wondered if it'd been lost after the SWAT raids.
[170:00.72]We can have the wine, too.
[170:02.50]Oh, this really brings back... Oh, didn't like that.
[170:04.36]Remember when we walled up tipsy cousin Cleo in the wine cellar after lowering her with the promise of an even finer vintage?
[170:11.34]Oh, how we laughed.
[170:14.11]Um, do you want the vinyl?
[170:17.73]These are mostly complications of Halloween sound effects and screams, so yes, please give this to me.
[170:25.42]What a weird thing.
[170:29.44]What a weird thing.
[170:32.95]The sound- Halloween sound effects.
[170:36.81]How do you record those, right?
[170:39.89]You need to record Halloween sound effects in a studio.
[170:43.52]I don't think you can do that in like a home studio.
[170:46.98]You have to be in a place where no one's gonna- no one will hear you.
[170:51.90]It's a bunch of screaming.
[170:54.30]and like, oh, please don't, like, where can you even reliably do that?
[171:05.03]Would you guys buy it if, would you guys buy a CD if I made a Halloween sound effects CD and sold it?
[171:16.50]It was like three hours long of just like background Halloween sound effects.
[171:24.02]Alright, you take- No!
[171:24.82]We don't like the photo.
[171:25.60]Alright, well I gotta even this out.
[171:30.45]Take the armor then.
[171:32.41]I will be smashing with great-grandmother's clay more literally.
[171:34.71]Okay, you can have the painting.
[171:39.13]I really like the painting.
[171:45.52]You can have like an intro by Bugleberry.
[171:50.07]you're about to hear some of the most horrifying Halloween sound effects ever ever compiled yeah like an intro by Bugleberry okay maybe alright what about a sack of cash it has to be even right
[172:18.25]DJ's made of two parts endangered tiger, one part Great Barrier Reef.
[172:21.37]Daddy knew how to live.
[172:23.97]Urn of Ashes.
[172:24.81]I'll give that to you.
[172:25.87]Whoa, okay, never mind.
[172:31.72]Um... What crystal orb?
[172:37.72]Halloween farts?
[172:38.68]I mean, you understand the city's gonna be just absolute horseshit, right?
[172:46.70]This is gonna be insane.
[172:47.74]This is gonna be just an insane, like, 25-track CD.
[172:50.01]Okay.
[172:50.45]Alright, this needs to be even.
[172:59.65]Here, you take the ashes.
[173:00.43]And then you take the orb.
[173:04.15]Alright, this is pretty good.
[173:07.43]How about the sports car?
[173:09.31]Alright, we're almost there.
[173:12.87]What about a blade?
[173:14.97]No.
[173:17.12]No, it's not even... Alright, so what about the- you take the vinyl- Okay, that's it!
[173:22.42]Right there, I got it!
[173:28.70]Shit.
[173:28.88]Does it have to be full?
[173:31.98]Bro got four things!
[173:33.26]Boy, he's really happy about it!
[173:35.84]What do you mean?
[173:36.26]He's got tons of stuff!
[173:43.24]No, you don't want to carry.
[173:44.12]Okay, you really like the photo.
[173:49.54]You really like... No, you like the sports car more.
[173:52.65]You keep the sports car.
[173:56.33]You like that armor more.
[174:00.27]Neither one of you like this at all.
[174:02.23]So you can take that back.
[174:05.87]What about the photo?
[174:07.13]Alright, you like the photo more?
[174:11.53]You like the hat more, kind of?
[174:15.03]You like the wine?
[174:15.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[174:24.19]Nope.
[174:28.39]What about the blade?
[174:29.75]Alright, you like the blade more?
[174:35.43]What about the orb?
[174:37.33]Alright, we're almost there.
[174:38.71]You're full.
[174:42.73]Shit, no.
[174:43.67]Stay over there.
[174:46.18]His memory is so bad.
[174:47.90]They change.
[174:49.06]They change.
[174:49.60]They change.
[174:49.96]They change.
[174:54.38]Urn of Ashes.
[174:55.18]Okay.
[174:57.26]They're so close.
[175:03.04]Hat.
[175:04.62]It's so goddamn close.
[175:07.77]They change.
[175:34.45]It's literally a centimeter.
[175:35.65]Go back, go back, go back.
[175:55.10]Oh my god, there's one thing that needs to be changed.
[175:58.50]One thing.
[176:17.01]What am I doing?
[176:17.71]I just did it!
[176:19.83]I just did it!
[176:20.31]I just did it!
[176:28.18]It's all of Daddy's things, and I feel quite pleased with my haul.
[176:31.29]And me as well.
[176:32.45]If I'm in such a good mood, I'm almost feeling feelings again.
[176:35.03]Here's a further help pedestrian.
[176:37.67]And please don't tell any of the servants.
[176:39.03]They'll start asking me for silver dollars or whatever they eat these days.
[176:43.09]I guess we should thank you, Vinstripes.
[176:45.45]And tell you what you want to know about the event.
[176:47.89]We won't.
[176:48.66]The reward is our smiling snoots.
[176:50.68]Now get out of our car before we ring the police.
[176:57.65]been doing that why am I doing that I'm going like okay well that's cool I still haven't pissed let's do that now I'm gonna piss up right back
[178:12.16]Thank you.
[179:02.79]you
[179:54.29]Oh.
[180:44.39]Thank you.
[181:33.92]Thank you.
[183:16.81]Hello.
[183:27.18]Yeah, I refilled my drink.
[183:29.92]I was getting a little dry.
[183:32.43]It's probably adding honey to his mint green tea.
[183:42.83]No?
[183:43.15]Good.
[183:45.64]Matcha powder?
[183:46.12]Alright, let's go.
[183:51.52]Hi.
[183:52.88]There's a lot of first-time chatters on this stream.
[183:58.58]Is there really?
[184:01.30]What's going on?
[184:01.72]How are you?
[184:07.11]Welcome!
[184:07.91]Actually, hi.
[184:08.73]Is there really a lot of people that are new?
[184:14.23]We're just chilling.
[184:14.73]This is a chill stream.
[184:15.63]Just playing Later Alligator.
[184:21.25]I'll be live tomorrow, too.
[184:25.35]I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow.
[184:26.29]Maybe we'll figure it out in pre-stream.
[184:29.37]We'll play Webbed or something.
[184:32.28]Or... What's come out?
[184:34.24]What's new?
[184:35.70]Did anything come out recently?
[184:39.25]Star Child, I can feel your energy from over here.
[184:42.45]I'd say that's what's harshing my whole thing right now.
[184:45.03]Play Rogue Legacy 2?
[184:48.70]Is it good?
[184:51.34]I've seen a lot of Rogue Legacy 2.
[184:56.04]Is it a good game?
[184:56.82]Hmm.
[185:03.78]What about infomercials this week?
[185:06.60]I don't know.
[185:07.38]Maybe.
[185:07.64]Ahem.
[185:09.57]We'll see.
[185:12.71]Solid?
[185:15.97]Alright, well, let's keep going with this.
[185:18.33]I say it's what's harshing my whole thing right now, but the truth is I... I... I free-cycled some really gnarly bagels for lunch today out of the dumpster behind the furniture store.
[185:28.37]My mellow has been thoroughly pre-harshed.
[185:31.89]Now, why would there be bagels in the dumpster of a furniture store?
[185:35.37]Oh, throw pillows.
[185:36.79]Bummer.
[185:38.19]Listen, who among us...
[185:42.15]Um... What's the Among Us tune?
[185:56.18]I don't know.
[185:56.79]I actually don't know it.
[185:59.79]Uh... Who among us hasn't woken up at noon in a van under a blanket felted equally from Stranger, Lint, and Candy Wrappers?
[186:08.46]It's no wonder I got into the wrong dumpster.
[186:10.83]If anything, it's fate.
[186:12.83]You going to the birthday party?
[186:14.09]Tonight?
[186:16.17]Oh, dude, I'm sorry.
[186:17.11]I really can't tell you much.
[186:18.23]I've been sworn to secrecy.
[186:21.63]You know Pat?
[186:23.25]You say Pat?
[186:23.97]He's a pretty cool guy.
[186:25.11]Kind of dresses like a preschooler, though, if I'm being real.
[186:28.79]My little sister Lizzie is dating his cousin.
[186:31.55]I guess you could say we're kind of like family.
[186:34.81]You can say anything to strangers, really.
[186:36.27]No one can stop you.
[186:41.11]I'm Aiden it's totally chill to meet you dot com dot org I sort of knew someone would seek me out today I'm like a bit of a clairvoyant according to some sub forums I visit online plus I own a somewhat unsettling amount of powerful crystals their potent energies course through me in my inner core which is great since I spent the last of my dosh on some suspiciously expensive crystals my inner core is super starving man
[187:11.22]Alright, what do I have to do for you?
[187:13.38]I could actually, like, probably tell you a few things if you do me a solid first.
[187:16.54]You see, those suspiciously expensive crystals I mentioned earlier... Well, those little mamas were also suspiciously powerful.
[187:24.06]From just three nights of holding them, even when I had to get up to pee, I feel mystically charged enough to access my innermost self.
[187:31.80]But in my tireless questing through the crystal concentration arts, I just don't have the time to shower.
[187:38.39]Or dust my pewter miniatures.
[187:42.21]Besides, bathing is a way for the man to keep us down.
[187:45.53]You should be sliding across the floor on an oil slick of your own creation like nature intended.
[187:49.97]Ugh.
[187:52.39]My aromatic scent keeps away a lot of unwanted company.
[187:55.93]Like solicitors and my father.
[187:58.75]But did invite others.
[188:01.66]Talking about flies, these little buzzing buzz kills keep harshing my mellow.
[188:05.36]Hmm.
[188:08.36]They're making it impossible for me to concentrate on my inner light to do it inner right.
[188:14.20]If you know what I mean.
[188:17.30]If you could just swat them away from me while I'm getting my meditation on, I'd be happy to do you a solid in return.
[188:24.47]Will you be my spotter's swatter?
[188:26.87]Let's go.
[188:31.29]Click on flies and hornets to attack them with the fly swatter.
[188:33.44]Hornets take extra hits.
[188:35.02]Don't spot butterflies or Aiden.
[188:39.96]Alright, let's see.
[188:40.71]See, Dad, I do have friends.
[189:09.50]It's happening!
[189:09.96]The subforums were right!
[189:11.55]I have to keep going!
[189:12.31]These are loud.
[189:35.81]Imagine somebody like hitting you right in the face with a fly swatter.
[189:38.96]I'm filling the cosmos and I pick up Wi-Fi.
[189:42.45]Keep going, I'm almost there.
[190:12.33]The hurtbox is huge, yeah.
[190:15.65]What time is it right now?
[190:17.29]Hello, my star child.
[190:18.31]Through crystal channeling and staying mod at least... mod... modestly hydrated, like advised on social medias, I've been able to reach my most powerful form.
[190:37.40]I'm still the Aiden you've known and adored for so, so long, but a new, more powerful Aiden.
[190:42.76]A Payden, as it were.
[190:44.50]I like how I haven't been Payden weeks.
[190:47.89]I'm so hungry.
[190:49.53]Oh, just kidding.
[190:50.03]I don't feel the human desire for food in my new astral mode.
[190:52.75]Hey, did you hear an ice cream truck?
[190:54.29]For no reason.
[190:56.05]I just like the song the truck plays.
[190:57.61]It's a real bop.
[191:05.43]I can now tell you a bit about the event since I'm a being of pure energy and knowledge given form.
[191:11.74]But also a being that's like extremely good at keeping secrets, man.
[191:16.04]What little I can tell you is that it concerns Pat for a certain reason.
[191:19.64]That's really all I can say.
[191:20.54]I don't want Lizzie to get mad at me for spilling the beans.
[191:23.10]She's got those angry little sister hands.
[191:26.72]Even beings of pure peaceful energy are averse to tiny sister punches.
[191:32.15]Thank you again for your spiritual guidance.
[191:33.95]What you have done here today will not soon be forgotten, at least not for the 45 minutes of short-term memory I have.
[191:40.81]You hear an ice cream truck?
[191:43.17]No, just go get a fucking ice cream and stop.
[191:45.75]That was it.
[191:49.19]Oh, shit.
[191:50.31]The party's at 8.
[191:55.27]The party's at 8 o'clock.
[191:56.27]We'll end like another... This is pretty much it.
[192:08.75]What was that?
[192:12.91]Oh, Jared.
[192:13.79]Oh, hey, didn't see you down there.
[192:15.45]Can you move about two centimeters to the right?
[192:17.25]The placement of my eyes is particularly wacky.
[192:21.61]I'm waiting for a call, but my phone has been pretty dinked up lately.
[192:24.57]I wonder if it'll even come in.
[192:25.61]Maybe I should ask the bartender to use the phone here.
[192:28.49]Oh, that's not going to work since I stored the number I need here in my broken phone.
[192:35.59]How did anyone even get by before modern cell phone technology?
[192:38.19]How did they send each other messages or watch videos about people drinking a gallon of milk and throwing up?
[192:45.14]I guess I'll just have to write letters now and film myself barfing on VHS.
[192:50.02]Just like the pilgrims would have.
[192:54.36]Oh, you going to that too?
[192:56.10]I tell you more about it, but the sad truth is I jotted down all the deets in my phone here, but the dang thing has been on the fritz for over a week now.
[193:04.67]Yeah, this song is good.
[193:09.95]Hat the alligator, that's my little cousin.
[193:11.89]All my cousins are little to me, even the older ones.
[193:14.86]Hat, however, is particularly small.
[193:16.22]Maybe that's why he's so skittish.
[193:17.48]A guy that tiny could slip into a crack anytime or get lost in a medium-sized mouse hole.
[193:24.48]Like a borrower or something.
[193:28.53]Folks call me Tall Jared.
[193:29.71]I don't really get it though.
[193:30.53]Honestly, I'm not even the tallest Jared that I personally know.
[193:33.53]Yeah, let that info sink in for a little while.
[193:36.59]I can see your imagination running wild in your extremely visible eyes.
[193:43.66]Remember, you would like Break Core.
[193:45.56]I don't know what that is.
[193:46.56]What is Break Core?
[193:49.10]Ever since I got back from that ghastly Mansions of the Rich and Dead tour I did on my vacation, what's really ghastly is the distribution of wealth among the populace.
[193:57.39]And the dedulous.
[193:59.51]I don't know what I'm going to do.
[194:00.49]My phone is my life, literally.
[194:02.19]I don't have a rich inner existence or anything.
[194:05.15]It's mostly all saved on here in the form of a dream journal and pictures of good breakfasts I've had.
[194:11.30]I don't know how much of a tech person you are, but do you think you could take a look?
[194:19.06]It's okay.
[194:19.80]Fix his cell phone?
[194:23.15]What is BreakCore?
[194:25.31]What is BreakCore?
[194:30.41]Look up Pac-Man?
[194:31.53]Hold on.
[194:35.06]This is like... I can type this, right?
[194:39.74]Okay, someone said Breakcore Pac-Man?
[194:48.95]Wait, what am I putting on?
[194:52.79]Breakcore Pac-Man.
[194:56.09]I'll give it a try.
[195:05.08]Oh no.
[195:05.76]Oh my god.
[195:06.98]Where is it?
[195:07.36]I can't find it.
[195:08.32]Does it go to YouTube?
[195:13.21]Break Core Pac-Man?
[195:19.01]This one's called The Prophet.
[195:21.91]Pac-Man.
[195:26.32]This one?
[195:27.54]Is this the one you're talking about?
[195:30.06]Not this one.
[195:30.50]Which one?
[195:43.29]any break it doesn't matter oh just break core why do you want to look a pac-man this thing says cure for adhd what this is a journey into sound a journey which along the way will this one will bring to you new color new dimension new values and a new experience let's see if it works so our journey takes us into the field this is was it gonna work
[196:14.71]Let's see if it works.
[196:17.45]What was that?
[196:18.21]This is crazy.
[196:59.89]I can feel like... I feel like there's a counter on the top right of the screen and it's at like one minute left in an old video game and I have to hurry the fuck up and get to the end.
[197:18.81]This is cra- Wow, this is crazy.
[197:22.33]What the fuck was that?
[197:23.13]Was that a Slap Chop guy?
[197:35.81]Yo.
[197:36.19]Yo!
[197:58.20]This is the only way you can listen to this music!
[198:00.94]This is the only way you can listen to this music.
[198:02.68]There's no other way to listen to that.
[198:04.46]There's only one way to listen to this music and it's like this.
[198:06.58]Played at a club, disco, lounge, house, basement, or block party.
[198:22.90]Like, I'm downloading all of the world's knowledge in one second.
[198:27.18]Like, I'm downloading all of human history.
[198:29.78]There was... There were the dinosaurs.
[198:35.48]I just, okay, I just saw the... I can't even talk!
[198:40.09]I can't even talk.
[198:41.23]I'm downloading, it's like Matrix.
[198:43.37]I'm gonna be able to learn, I'm gonna know how to, like, fly a... Okay, turn it off.
[198:46.41]That was insane.
[198:54.22]There's other ones?
[198:57.13]What if I skip forward a little?
[198:58.31]Woah!
[198:58.99]I feel- woah.
[199:06.49]This is like a- no, this is- alright.
[199:07.93]There you go, you ready?
[199:08.59]Ready for this shit?
[199:09.91]This is- you go- you like- like mom comes in the room.
[199:12.80]This is all mom sees.
[199:19.82]Like you're at your computer.
[199:21.58]Let me see if I can line this up right.
[199:24.11]Like, this is the kind of music where it's just like, whoa, you're getting way too into that.
[199:27.42]I mean, you're too close here.
[199:28.30]I got you.
[199:34.95]You're really locked in here.
[199:37.49]And you don't know that anyone's in the room.
[199:40.25]And this person could literally just be in the room.
[199:42.97]It could be like your mom or like a sibling.
[199:44.91]And somebody could literally just be like, hey, look, you ready for dinner?
[199:48.25]And this is all they see in here, like kind of in through your headphones.
[199:50.89]And it's going to take they're going to have to go like go like this to your desk.
[199:55.46]Imagine opening the door.
[199:56.34]You just see this.
[200:16.18]Like, you can't get a hold of me!
[200:19.12]You're never gonna get a hold of me!
[200:24.25]Put it on different one?
[200:27.21]That looks bad?
[200:27.97]What?
[200:28.13]What do you mean stop?
[200:30.90]What?
[200:52.44]I don't mean that like, you know, come into the room.
[200:55.72]He said he was listening to that.
[200:58.01]Oh, alright, whatever.
[201:12.11]What did I miss?
[201:12.87]You didn't miss anything.
[201:14.09]All I did was I was blasting a cure for ADHD.
[201:17.89]And I just wanted to make it whatever.
[201:20.11]This is wild though.
[201:21.29]This is actually wild.
[201:23.95]It's so ridiculous.
[201:27.95]I feel like after listening to this for like more than two or three minutes, I would just probably go like this.
[201:32.17]Like... It's like screaming.
[201:44.41]Put on, what is this one?
[201:45.59]That was intense.
[201:50.27]That was like really intense.
[201:51.45]That was crazy.
[201:57.78]Parents walk in to sun to break core.
[202:04.90]Circing it to break core.
[202:20.39]It was Breakcore's listening party.
[202:24.97]Breakcore is so good.
[202:26.15]Alright, what is this one?
[202:28.15]This one's like kind of a scary album cover.
[202:32.79]What's this one?
[202:39.02]This one?
[202:42.24]What song should I put on?
[202:44.64]You're opening my eyes.
[202:45.42]I've never heard this before.
[202:47.73]Which one?
[202:53.78]This is royalty in Braycore.
[202:55.56]Is there a certain song?
[202:56.23]There's a lot of songs here.
[202:56.97]I've seen a lot of recommendations here.
[203:03.87]Alright, how about, like, this one's called Ghost.
[203:14.24]Is this DMCA?
[203:15.22]Is it?
[203:28.46]Alright.
[203:29.56]It's DMCA.
[203:30.76]Alright.
[203:33.28]Pretty sick.
[203:36.79]Alright.
[203:37.63]I can see it.
[203:40.39]I don't want to.
[203:41.91]Oh.
[203:46.53]Oh.
[203:52.02]Oh, alright.
[204:02.74]I can play the goddamn game.
[204:06.00]Let's play the game.
[204:08.32]Where's the- Where's the- Fuck, it's stuck in my head forever.
[204:29.67]This is the crazy part, right?
[204:30.91]But like, if you open the door, and whoever's in there can't fucking hear you, but it's time for dinner, like, how are you going to get their attention?
[204:42.38]Like, calling them?
[204:44.24]Maybe like a Discord message.
[204:46.76]Right?
[204:46.92]You're gonna, like, you're gonna have to go through Discord, and like, hopefully they go, who's up?
[204:51.42]You're gonna have to go shake them.
[204:56.68]I don't even think that would work.
[205:00.54]Flick the lights on and off.
[205:01.36]I don't even think that would even work.
[205:03.74]Like, he's moving so much that, like, you, like, shaking them is, like, they're not gonna even know.
[205:11.64]Did you just throw something at them?
[205:20.55]Like, frisbee something into the room?
[205:22.37]And it, like, frisbees in and, like...
[205:33.91]Stop stalling.
[205:34.93]We're not stalling.
[205:36.51]Stalling, stalling.
[205:37.71]All these stalling Andes.
[205:39.29]Okay.
[205:49.65]No, no.
[205:50.09]You know what that is?
[205:52.09]That's just all the hardest difficulty on Dance Dance Revolution.
[205:57.42]That's the one where you see the people that are standing with their arms holding the... They're holding the bar like this behind them.
[206:03.56]And they're just like... Like just their feet are fucking going crazy.
[206:09.51]And you walk by and you're just like... Shit.
[206:13.11]Wow.
[206:15.41]How are they even doing that?
[206:16.47]It's impossible.
[206:17.81]That's what it reminds me of.
[206:20.77]My brain's just too small to be able to do any of that stuff.
[206:23.89]They look like they're having a great time.
[206:27.40]That was pretty cool, though.
[206:28.48]I'll watch it off-stream.
[206:32.04]I'll listen to it off-stream.
[206:32.99]I'm very intrigued.
[206:34.61]I've never heard of this before.
[206:37.29]Okay, let's fix the phone.
[206:38.95]I've never heard of this before.
[206:39.73]Alright, we have to fix his phone?
[206:45.77]Some of my notes are pretty personal.
[206:54.42]Oh, Dream Journal.
[206:58.04]I was in the woods and I was running on all fours and there was a monster chasing me.
[207:02.14]I'm at school and everyone's making fun of me because I forgot all math.
[207:05.50]I'm hungry.
[207:06.90]Look at myself in the mirror and accept my father is looking back at me.
[207:10.62]He turns into sand and now I'm holding two hams.
[207:13.82]I have fish hands and it's the best dream ever.
[207:21.18]You're violating this guy's privacy.
[207:24.79]I have to fix his phone.
[207:30.48]See, I told you my phone was acting up.
[207:31.64]Error code.
[207:33.30]09590.
[207:33.44]A ghost.
[207:41.56]Alright, grocery list.
[207:44.22]Riceys, large ham, muffins, paper towels, cleaning spray, dirtying spray, good breakfast, sandwich bread, peanut butter, small ham.
[207:58.53]It's really good workout music.
[208:02.03]I feel like that's the kind of music I would keep doing reps.
[208:05.95]I wouldn't stop.
[208:06.49]I would just keep going.
[208:07.73]I'd be like, that was 10?
[208:09.07]Fuck, we're doing 40.
[208:11.05]And you'd get to like 35 and have to go home.
[208:13.93]You know what I mean?
[208:14.51]I'd be like, ah, I gotta go home now.
[208:18.24]Go to breakfast.
[208:22.24]Okay, I'm not working on a video game.
[208:24.28]I just thought these would be some cool ideas.
[208:27.11]Spooky game about three kids in a bad summer camp.
[208:30.21]Cute game about a sweet knight who gets to escort four hot princes down a mountain.
[208:34.77]Stupid mystery game about alligators in the city.
[208:38.33]Too much work.
[208:39.91]Dramatic game about mecha pilots fighting over the fate of humanity and kissing.
[208:43.19]Okay, what else we got?
[208:48.57]Video time.
[208:50.25]When I get really stressed, I watch soothing videos.
[208:52.05]It calms me.
[208:54.29]Alligator sensory meridian response?
[208:57.47]Okay.
[209:06.52]Uh, what about when train?
[209:09.02]Turn.
[209:09.58]This is the third train schedule app I've tried, but I'm still late all the time.
[209:12.58]Okay.
[209:21.19]Pictures.
[209:22.62]You're gonna look through my photos?
[209:23.84]Should I... Okay, no, I'm sure there's nothing too embarrassing in there.
[209:27.64]Do you want to look first?
[209:31.24]That's my little sib.
[209:33.20]Joanie.
[209:34.24]I caught them on candid camera.
[209:35.64]It's like food?
[209:41.98]Uh, other... Did you look at that?
[209:44.00]Handsome fella.
[209:45.64]I give myself compliments every day.
[209:46.88]It's like a workout for your self-esteem.
[209:48.54]Huh.
[209:48.72]Do you want to look at it?
[209:53.65]When I found a cute cafe.
[209:55.57]What was that?
[209:59.83]Did you do that with my phone?
[210:01.68]Turn off the flash, Jared.
[210:06.12]Well, I would if I knew how.
[210:10.56]Save my photo.
[210:11.36]Alright.
[210:15.13]My vacation pics.
[210:15.89]Hope you're ready to relive some memories of me.
[210:21.24]Hey, my phone started acting up after we went to this weird house.
[210:24.35]Oh, it's this one!
[210:27.15]Delete that one.
[210:31.07]Got it.
[210:31.61]Got it.
[210:35.71]That was definitely strange.
[210:37.55]Alright, I gotta delete all the ghost pictures.
[210:42.00]It was nice being so close to the mountains.
[210:44.74]Alright, we got all the ghost pictures.
[210:49.14]Is there a ghost in this one?
[210:51.51]No.
[210:52.13]Which one did I delete?
[210:52.91]Wait, what is that?
[210:56.53]Isn't this from an anime?
[210:59.84]It's from an anime.
[211:02.84]Don't mess with this boulder.
[211:03.54]I have a lot of picks that I really hate to lose.
[211:09.66]It's not these.
[211:10.54]The camaraderie is important to me.
[211:12.08]Oh, is that?
[211:15.30]Excuse me.
[211:15.88]That wouldn't happen to be Goku, would it?
[211:19.54]He's just so cool.
[211:23.10]Okay, I don't care about those.
[211:24.18]These are whatever.
[211:24.74]Screenshots.
[211:26.52]This code does something cool.
[211:27.52]Do you have a way to scan it?
[211:29.28]I'm fucking scanning it.
[211:30.08]I don't know what that does.
[211:33.24]Scan it.
[211:42.24]I'm scanning it.
[211:42.82]I don't scan QR codes.
[211:48.62]I don't know.
[211:49.12]I don't scan QR codes.
[211:51.21]No, they freak me out.
[211:56.14]Coward.
[211:56.84]I don't scan QR codes!
[211:57.72]They freak me out!
[212:01.04]Pictures.
[212:01.46]Alright, Internet Splunker.
[212:05.88]I want to scan it.
[212:06.60]No!
[212:06.88]Don't scan it!
[212:07.50]Who knows what it is?
[212:07.94]It could be anything.
[212:09.60]Will scan it.
[212:13.42]What is it?
[212:15.56]Scan the code.
[212:16.76]I... I don't scan QR codes!
[212:22.69]You're scared of ovens, gas, and QR codes.
[212:27.04]Why don't you do it?
[212:29.56]It's too, it's too, like, algorithmic to me.
[212:31.67]It's like, I don't know, it's too, it's like too much, it's like data.
[212:33.75]I don't know, I don't like it.
[212:34.37]I don't know, that's weird.
[212:38.67]Put it on screen again.
[212:39.73]How, I, um... There!
[212:46.28]What is it?
[212:48.10]It's literally just a barcode.
[212:49.38]I know, but it's, it's weird!
[212:50.50]Like, why does that do anything?
[212:51.68]Why does this do anything?
[212:55.00]What kind of alien technology?
[212:56.60]If you guys don't think that we have alien technology.
[212:59.34]That's alien technology.
[213:00.86]You can... What?
[213:02.36]That's a fucking inkblot that has data.
[213:04.42]That doesn't make any sense.
[213:09.79]It's just... It's like a weird display of like data inkblot like pixels.
[213:14.91]Why can that give data?
[213:17.47]It's strange.
[213:18.53]It's really strange.
[213:19.25]Aliens created it.
[213:21.61]I don't want it anymore.
[213:30.22]It's a video.
[213:43.29]That's fun.
[213:44.63]I'm not scanning it.
[213:45.87]No!
[213:47.05]I'm not gonna scan it.
[213:48.17]What happened to my voice?
[213:48.94]Alright, what's it like outside?
[213:52.36]Some people like sunny days, some people like rainy days.
[213:54.92]I like the forecast when it's just like this.
[213:56.50]Pretty good.
[214:05.57]It's pretty good out.
[214:06.39]75?
[214:07.21]Yeah, I'd say like 78 to 85 is good.
[214:13.41]Okay, what about, like, settings?
[214:16.29]This screen, this screen isn't helpful at all.
[214:17.91]What do you think ghost mode is?
[214:21.01]What's your password?
[214:26.29]Don't look at my calls.
[214:27.41]Don't try to call anyone either.
[214:28.35]It's sort of out of minutes.
[214:30.23]I only have 22 seconds left and I still have to call my grandma.
[214:33.61]What's your password?
[214:37.18]Is it this?
[214:37.54]I can't type it.
[214:45.86]I can't type.
[215:00.85]Recent searches.
[215:03.03]Breakfast near me, breakfast many pancakes, sleep sounds.
[215:05.43]What's the best password?
[215:08.57]Ghost?
[215:10.45]Going to test the best, most secure password for anything is Ghost.
[215:13.17]You're welcome.
[215:13.89]Okay.
[215:18.82]Okay, Ghost.
[215:25.86]Ghost mode activated.
[215:30.25]Ghost?
[215:34.33]Yes.
[215:36.47]Okay, now I'm on Ghost mode?
[215:44.23]How am I on ghost mode?
[215:47.03]Good breakfast.
[215:50.27]I am hungry for a good breakfast.
[215:52.81]Okay.
[215:53.27]Alright, what about like breakfast places?
[216:03.32]Don't delete that one.
[216:05.80]Ghost mode.
[216:10.32]Nope.
[216:12.96]Nope.
[216:15.08]No ghost here.
[216:15.64]No ghost here.
[216:32.09]Let's see a ghost there.
[216:34.61]Ghost.
[216:36.21]No ghost.
[216:37.47]No ghost there.
[216:38.05]Dude, what?
[216:39.53]No ghost.
[216:43.06]No ghost.
[216:48.88]No ghost.
[216:49.42]I don't see a ghost.
[216:53.26]Whoa!
[216:54.78]You deleted the mom and dad photo?
[216:56.06]No, I didn't.
[217:01.69]Where did my handsome swimming boys go?
[217:03.31]No, this is a nightmare.
[217:04.33]Get rid of it.
[217:13.34]Oh god, next time I go on vacation it'll be something safe like go-karting or a nude beach.
[217:17.94]No more creepy old mansions with dark legacies contaminated by the vengeful souls that reside within, I swear it.
[217:23.20]So I did it, right?
[217:28.38]That was terrifying.
[217:29.08]Can I have my phone back?
[217:29.86]Yeah!
[217:31.62]There you go.
[217:33.86]Why are you assuming that that was his parents?
[217:37.25]Did you know that?
[217:38.49]Was the information there that those were his parents?
[217:40.15]Parents?
[217:41.57]He didn't say that.
[217:43.70]He didn't say that.
[217:45.52]Well, he wasn't listening.
[217:46.24]I was too busy fixing somebody's phone using telecommunications intelligence to do it.
[217:50.44]I was literally fixing his phone.
[217:52.06]Stop talking to me while I'm trying to fix your phone.
[217:55.16]Oh no, my photo.
[217:55.94]So many memories all gone.
[217:56.99]At least you got the haunted ones, I guess.
[217:59.67]Nice to have a functioning phone again.
[218:00.81]It's like I'm reconnected to society.
[218:03.15]Take that, actually looking people in the eye and talking to them directly.
[218:06.65]Thanks, random stranger.
[218:07.65]Or should I say random friend?
[218:11.31]He deleted all of his personal photos.
[218:15.29]I don't know, there could have been a ghost!
[218:27.47]Caterer for the event.
[218:28.47]A lot of work since the family is practically made of food allergies and intolerances, but I'll manage.
[218:34.11]Thanks so much for all your help, I'll see you tonight.
[218:35.40]By the way, can you have wheat?
[218:40.42]Not sure, actually.
[218:45.17]Hey, city pal.
[218:46.95]I was just wondering, since we've been texting a bunch.
[218:50.23]Um, have you heard of 9th Street Station at all?
[218:52.28]No.
[218:54.82]Oh yeah, I didn't think so.
[218:56.88]Well, it's been closed for a few years.
[218:58.30]Not a lot going on there since then.
[219:00.86]Still got some of the most beautiful architecture of all the underground shops in the city.
[219:05.14]I'd really like to go there, actually.
[219:07.83]I was just thinking, um, if you ever wanted to stop by there, maybe I could meet you.
[219:11.51]No pressure or anything.
[219:12.23]You probably have to really help a conductor out to even get access.
[219:15.53]It's pretty underground.
[219:16.49]Awful.
[219:19.46]Okay, I was actually on the floor that time, but I'd fallen unrelated to laughing.
[219:24.22]Anyway, don't worry about 9th Street.
[219:25.88]You can forget what I said.
[219:27.38]If you want.
[219:27.86]I mean, I feel like I write, like, like, bro, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[219:35.05]Like, relax.
[219:38.65]Bro.
[219:44.09]Bobby Blue Eyes, what are you staring at, chump?
[219:48.41]Put those peepers away before I yank them clear out of your skull.
[219:52.59]Oh, you think you're a tough guy or something?
[219:54.64]You think you can roll in here in a pinstripe suit, not dissimilar to my own, and share a passing glance with me?
[220:00.12]Well, you got another thing coming to you, pal-y, and it ain't nothing good.
[220:03.36]Around these parts, I'm the toughest guy you're going to meet.
[220:05.86]I don't think you can slide into my bar and lock eyes casually with me across the room.
[220:10.82]You'll be sorry when I pull those babies out and smack them into twin yolkies.
[220:16.20]I'll let you guess what the red sauce is, but you're not going to like it.
[220:21.08]What's at the event?
[220:23.20]Bobby ain't spilling family secrets.
[220:27.43]Pat?
[220:27.81]Oh, that little jabroni's my first cousin once removed.
[220:30.78]Kind of like how I'm about to remove your eyes, as I previously in the conversation mentioned.
[220:38.13]Three boys.
[220:38.81]I'm doing it on purpose.
[220:40.41]Don't you get it?
[220:41.17]Don't you get it?
[220:41.79]I'm doing it on purpose.
[220:43.27]You think the red sauce thing was too far?
[220:44.77]Maybe it was a bit too far.
[220:47.17]I'm testing out some new tough guy material tonight, so it's a bit of hit or miss.
[220:51.83]Eric Cartman.
[220:54.69]The name's Bobby Blue Eyes, and don't you forget it, because he's going to be etched into your tombstone.
[220:59.17]Oh, wait on your tombstone.
[221:00.27]It would be your name.
[221:01.21]Burn it, Kyle.
[221:03.43]My name would be... Hey, just because I got confused about our society rituals, Kyle.
[221:08.88]It is.
[221:09.10]Yeah, you're right.
[221:12.54]Doesn't mean you can look away.
[221:13.28]We're having a conversation here.
[221:14.72]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[221:19.16]Unless you prove you're tough to me, the toughest guy in Alligator New York City.
[221:23.27]It ain't gonna be easy, though, and I'll make sure of that.
[221:26.41]Let's you and me play a little game called Three Finger Filet.
[221:30.27]Or are you two chickens?
[221:33.59]Yeah, let's do it.
[221:35.99]Carefully watch how Bobby stabs the table.
[221:38.24]Copy his pattern on your side.
[221:39.46]Be careful to avoid your fingers.
[221:44.40]Oh, so it looks like you've had a conversation with Two Fingers.
[221:47.88]You ready for this, tough guy?
[222:09.96]Wow, you did that four times, that's impressive.
[222:11.89]How many more times do you think you can pull that off?
[222:15.16]Shit.
[222:44.63]Good!
[222:48.67]Well, five times lets up the ante-bitch, shall we?
[222:54.85]Jesus!
[222:57.53]Whoa, whoa, what is that?
[222:59.13]That knife is... Terrific!
[223:01.05]It's perfect for a tough guy.
[223:02.37]Uh, let's keep going.
[223:50.30]See ya.
[223:51.44]Not bad, got all the way to six.
[223:53.07]I bet you think you're a real tough guy with those increasingly ludicrous knives you were weirdly having on your personage.
[224:01.39]Check this out.
[224:11.72]Owie, my fingy!
[224:12.84]Would you put a bandaid on it, please?
[224:24.57]Oh, ow, ow, ow.
[224:25.81]Gotta blow on it.
[224:26.55]Blow on it.
[224:27.13]I said, I don't want to play tough guys with you no more.
[224:32.31]You've ruined it by going too far.
[224:33.63]And now look what happened.
[224:34.51]I may never play bass guitar again.
[224:43.37]Family Badge.
[224:46.24]You're a real tough customer.
[224:47.34]Gotta give you that, Kyle.
[224:49.70]The event is happening.
[224:51.12]Do happy things or leave those imposterous knives at home.
[224:54.38]No go.
[224:55.16]Leave with my bandaid and my misery.
[224:57.38]Oh, ouchie.
[225:01.11]What time is it?
[225:06.31]Hey!
[225:07.17]Are you there?
[225:07.57]It's Pat.
[225:10.50]I know we haven't figured out what the family's totally nefarious secret is yet.
[225:14.72]Well, maybe if we walked there together, I'd feel safer.
[225:17.86]Is that okay?
[225:20.20]On my way.
[225:20.70]Alright, here we go.
[225:21.92]We have to go talk to Majima?
[225:27.93]I don't know.
[225:30.25]I think I beat the game.
[225:32.13]Did I?
[225:32.39]Who's that?
[225:41.08]Are we ready for surprise?
[225:45.98]Here we go.
[226:12.37]Three, what time is it?
[226:14.49]Seven o'clock.
[226:14.97]It's weird too, we're early.
[226:15.79]Aren't we early?
[226:24.37]We're early.
[226:29.27]Welcome back esteemed guest.
[226:30.35]I'm afraid our kitchen is closed early for a closed event in the hotel ballroom tonight.
[226:34.79]I provided Mr. Pat with some complimentary stale oyster crackers and tap water.
[226:39.13]If you follow me, I can show you to his room.
[226:44.88]Pardon me.
[226:46.00]We begin walking at your leisure.
[226:47.38]Man, what beautiful wallpaper we have.
[226:51.98]So rich and distracting.
[226:59.53]I like the art.
[227:00.11]It reminds me of home movies.
[227:14.62]You're right.
[227:14.94]Please inform Mr. Pat he can't have any more tap waters after you knock.
[227:17.84]Are you ready to go to the party?
[227:20.38]I've just been guzzling tap waters and stress eating these funny crackers the waiter gave me.
[227:25.49]Even though I'm not going to wear them, I went and got all my shoes out anyways.
[227:29.73]I think just for the company.
[227:32.62]Scary being alone in here.
[227:34.52]Now the event is about to begin, but maybe since you're here, nothing bad will happen.
[227:43.48]This counts as something bad happening.
[227:47.64]Do you have a flashlight?
[227:48.54]I'm scared of the dark.
[227:49.92]And a flashlight, but slightly less so.
[227:51.78]Hey, you found one.
[227:56.04]Do I look like that one video by Alligator Queen?
[227:58.62]Hopefully with this we can make it through the corridors of the hotel to the ballroom where the event is safely.
[228:03.87]Just walk really close to me, okay?
[228:05.27]We have no way of telling who or what is out in those twisty halls.
[228:09.69]Oh boy.
[228:12.95]Power is out, click and hold to guide path to the dark hotel.
[228:28.56]Go this way, no.
[228:29.24]I thought it was a staircase at first, we're good.
[228:37.81]I'm huge.
[228:46.36]A reminder of the inevitable passage of time that will one day consume us all into the infinite.
[228:51.62]Also, I can't read analog clocks.
[228:56.13]I didn't think I was going to really just completely be level with this character.
[229:01.31]But I get him now.
[229:05.66]I completely get you, man.
[229:08.38]Or either that or he's high as fuck.
[229:11.58]One or the other.
[229:11.98]So where do I go?
[229:21.18]How do I go?
[229:39.92]Huh.
[229:44.05]Oh, it was a staircase.
[229:45.71]Okay, I thought it was a wall.
[230:10.88]He's anything but Marty!
[230:11.90]That's actually really scary.
[230:17.28]Is he gonna chase us?
[230:17.94]Let's go up.
[230:35.19]I'm gonna say right.
[230:53.42]It's the were-guy from the train.
[230:56.07]Did you see it move?
[230:57.09]I think I saw it move.
[230:57.89]Is this the were-guy from the train?
[231:04.21]Or the boss or whatever?
[231:04.85]There's just something unwholesome about reading graphic novels in the pitch-dark sediment of a broken hotel wall.
[231:18.54]Alright.
[231:18.78]So this is the wrong way?
[231:21.30]Silent Hill?
[231:27.74]Whoop!
[231:30.26]Oh, it's the guy from the loading screen.
[231:34.92]Oh, Mandy!
[231:36.50]I'd ask what he's doing here, but he's attracted to spotlights.
[231:40.81]Like a moth that smells like hair gel.
[231:42.65]I made it!
[231:54.41]Here we go, here comes the big surprise.
[231:59.90]Surprise!
[232:01.18]It was a birthday party!
[232:08.40]Happy birthday!
[232:27.35]Aw, everyone's here.
[232:28.09]Well, at least the people that I talked to.
[232:32.66]It's just the people that I talked to.
[232:35.46]That's cute.
[232:37.04]Look at this.
[232:37.48]Everyone's here.
[232:38.02]Everyone's having a good time.
[232:38.86]What's up, old and moldy?
[232:41.69]You down for another heist?
[232:42.63]Sorry to pull you back in the game, but with a cake like this, how can you resist one last score?
[232:55.79]This is the worst party I've ever been to.
[232:57.12]It's simply dreadful, even worse than last year's.
[233:00.90]Even worse than the wrap party for the Gucci modeling shoot I did.
[233:03.92]That's Gucci adult-sized baby bonnets for strange alligators.
[233:08.70]Even worse than the release party where they found my ex-boyfriend, the house music DJ, run through with a claymore.
[233:13.91]Excuse me?
[233:16.59]I for one wasn't anywhere near there, of course, but how awful.
[233:18.85]Simply dreadful.
[233:23.65]Oh, here's the singing alligators.
[233:27.26]Happy birthday to you.
[233:29.29]You live in a zoo, you smell like an alligator, and that is unsuspicious and correct.
[233:37.51]Oh, we already saw you.
[233:40.73]We gave her the claymore.
[233:42.17]Oh, that's right.
[233:42.65]Oh, that's because they're sitting across from each other.
[233:47.23]Alright, what about grandma?
[233:49.07]Of course, it's been a dog's age since I've been to a swinging shindig.
[233:52.31]Do you know of any?
[233:55.33]I'm just kidding.
[233:56.49]Mostly.
[233:59.69]On my way over, I pass that abandoned Miss Hoople Dooms home for spooky 1800s children with coughs.
[234:08.08]And wouldn't you know it, my phone stopped working again.
[234:10.14]All it does now is sing Ring Around the Rosie in a slow, haunting manner.
[234:14.13]And try to order a stick and hoop with my credit card.
[234:20.11]So when, when, we gotta, oh, there's more people.
[234:23.82]This is like, happy.
[234:45.54]Good evening and good morrow, friend.
[234:47.06]What an auspicious sign that we have crossed paths once more.
[234:50.15]Perhaps we've some unknown star-designed connection.
[234:55.27]Oh, you really want to read about my zine about cool wizards?
[234:59.19]Check it out, I have a chapter dedicated to Toad Tapicus the Groovy.
[235:05.46]Hey there.
[235:06.18]I got worried you guys wouldn't make it on account of the blackout.
[235:09.20]Pat's scared of the dark.
[235:10.50]And hallways.
[235:11.30]And parties, come to think of it.
[235:12.50]This usually doesn't end as well as this, is what I'm saying.
[235:18.47]Oh, I'm so proud of my Patrick.
[235:20.13]He didn't threaten a coat rack shadow with a stapler and jump out a window.
[235:23.97]Or dump the punch bowl in the toilet thinking it was poison.
[235:27.09]This is already going so much better than his birthday last year.
[235:29.47]Oh my god.
[235:30.33]I'm going to lose my AARP discounts being up this late.
[235:37.74]They take a hard look at your benefits if you do too much staying up past 8 or rollerblading.
[235:42.76]I'm not giving up my Tuesdays at Rollerworld.
[235:48.90]Tell anyone about what you saw earlier and I'll break your kneecaps into enough pieces that the old maids can play Mahjong.
[235:55.40]And thanks, pal.
[236:00.76]Hey, uh, Peter.
[236:02.18]There, old pally.
[236:03.93]It's time for an old-fashioned handshake.
[236:08.03]Ignore the snail trail.
[236:09.93]I'm told it's full of vitamins and helps with drying.
[236:13.57]And that it comes with my- out my limbs and leaves you crying.
[236:16.95]Oh, hey, where you going?
[236:19.85]Only a couple more.
[236:22.47]Horace and I have come to an understanding of sorts, wherein he remains dead and courteous, and I don't call in a priest or buy any more poisons wholesale.
[236:30.05]Hey, it's you, Comrade Pinstripes!
[236:35.89]Good news!
[236:36.52]Pre-orders on my blog for the zine are through the roof.
[236:40.38]Since five copies are already spoken for, I'm sure to sell out of all seven by the end of the convention.
[236:46.82]With a word getting out like this, we'll definitely get Mayor Wibbly Finn's resignation within the week.
[236:52.05]Or at least he might take my petition about planting more trees in Alligator Memorial Park more seriously.
[236:57.77]He'd better, or those edited videos of him set to humorous fart sounds and kazoo music aren't going to stop being posted to Snootbook.
[237:04.60]Hold your local government accountable, or they'll get him memeing.
[237:11.79]Alright, both of them.
[237:13.45]Sure, whatever.
[237:13.97]Alright.
[237:14.63]And, of course, our esteemed guest.
[237:17.97]I'm sure happy.
[237:19.25]I wasn't getting rubbed out.
[237:20.25]I was getting birthday clout.
[237:22.43]It's so nice to have my beloved family here with me.
[237:24.59]We're going to take a big family photo and everything.
[237:27.45]That means you too, if that's okay.
[237:29.88]Everything you did for me today, it really meant so much to me.
[237:32.72]You're a really special friend.
[237:33.98]I can't thank you enough.
[237:35.92]Oh, come on.
[237:36.32]Everything is ready for the photo.
[237:37.92]Except for you.
[237:38.80]Follow me.
[237:40.59]Are we gonna see the face?
[237:41.25]Face reveal?
[237:43.11]Face reveal!
[237:43.75]Oh my god!
[237:44.24]Definitely this one.
[237:48.36]Or this one.
[238:12.08]It's, of course.
[238:14.32]Who could have forgot me?
[238:15.98]Alligator Bernie Sanders.
[238:18.75]I just really wanted to try to bring people together.
[238:27.29]Is that good?
[238:33.54]Alright, that's good.
[238:37.18]Why am I in the front?
[238:43.70]This is not my birthday party.
[238:45.06]I should be like back here.
[238:49.06]Congratulations.
[238:52.52]That's cute.
[238:54.27]That was cute.
[238:56.81]That was really cute.
[238:57.85]Come on.
[239:05.88]The game has won the story and suite.
[239:07.82]But though it seems done, has this all been deceit?
[239:10.52]What's really going on?
[239:11.28]Does our tale end right here?
[239:12.78]The more family you come upon, the more truth will grow clear.
[239:15.42]That was an actual... That was actually a children's game.
[239:26.15]That was an E for Everyone game, okay?
[239:27.87]It was an E for Everyone.
[239:35.70]Is this a true ending?
[239:37.14]You gotta 100% the game for a true ending.
[239:41.09]Do a bread tier list right now or I'm gonna be pissed.
[239:43.91]Do you have a bread tier list for me to do?
[239:45.47]Is there a bread tier list that you would like me to do?
[239:48.35]I'll do it right now.
[239:52.11]Okay.
[239:53.69]A bread tier list.
[239:56.11]It doesn't exist.
[239:58.88]You unlocked Pat Game Skip.
[240:00.24]More mysteries await you in Alligator New York City.
[240:02.30]Oh jeez.
[240:06.80]That was really cool.
[240:09.68]Look, find one.
[240:10.26]I'm sure it doesn't, it does not exist.
[240:13.34]Do people actually have one?
[240:14.15]Do you actually have one?
[240:19.37]There's a certain character everyone wants me to talk to, so I'm going to go do that first before everybody yells at me.
[240:26.05]Where is it?
[240:26.61]Okay.
[240:26.79]Can one of the mods grab one of the links that are not allowed in the channel?
[240:37.68]The credits were like a who's who of funny web animators.
[240:41.28]That's cool.
[240:43.28]Red types tier list.
[240:46.24]Okay.
[240:48.38]Where's this character you guys want me to... Where is it?
[240:49.80]Where are they?
[240:59.75]They're in the bar.
[241:00.31]Okay.
[241:07.23]Or are they in the back?
[241:16.72]Is that them?
[241:17.76]Okay.
[241:17.94]There's so many of these.
[241:25.01]This one looks fine.
[241:30.57]Okay.
[241:31.95]I have a bread tier list here.
[241:33.19]We'll do this first.
[241:36.80]Okay.
[241:36.90]If you keep pestering me didn't I tell you I was waiting for someone?
[242:01.23]Yeah, I know, Pat.
[242:02.27]Who's asking?
[242:03.29]Oh, you are.
[242:04.13]Right, right.
[242:05.01]Sorry, I'm a little socially anxious right now.
[242:07.41]Basically all the time.
[242:08.37]I've known Pat since high school, when the seniors got paired up with a freshman buddy to run the three-legged race.
[242:15.17]As the gym teacher tied the rope around our legs, Pat flipped out and thought he was being kidnapped.
[242:19.67]Started running like a maniac down the football field with my gym pants still attached to him.
[242:23.57]That's how I got my other nickname, Birthmark Butt.
[242:27.95]Since then, we've been good pals despite it loved that weird little guy.
[242:33.66]People call me the knife on account of my design containing sharp edges and how I poked my eye out in a freak Jack-o'-lantern carving accident back in the fourth grade.
[242:43.05]In case I'll cut you.
[242:45.01]Out of extracurriculars if I catch you in the hall without a pass.
[242:48.81]I'm a guidance counselor for Miss Petty Snoot's school for snobby and gifted middle schoolers.
[242:53.54]My nickname is just there to scare the preteens, to be honest.
[242:57.88]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[242:59.94]I gotta be honest with you, I ain't really waiting for nobody.
[243:01.58]I'm just here at the bar to practice being casual and meeting other folks.
[243:05.44]You know, in a romantical-like manner.
[243:08.34]But I always seem to say the wrong thing and scare the other gators off.
[243:10.54]How was I supposed to know complimenting someone's bulging neck veins was weird?
[243:14.70]I have those.
[243:15.14]They look real cool.
[243:18.59]Anyways, between work and my somewhat bad personality, I don't get out much.
[243:22.37]It's so hard to just meet people in non-weird ways, you know?
[243:24.93]I wish I could just practice or something.
[243:28.61]Wait a minute, that ain't a bad idea.
[243:29.71]If I could just find a buddy to practice dates on, I could be way more ready when the real deal comes along.
[243:36.01]I know you're only talking to me because Pat set you up on one of his weird wild goose-like chases.
[243:40.80]But I ain't got a lot of friends to tell you the truth, so maybe if you help me practice, I could help you out too.
[243:44.60]I want to go on a fake date with a rusty edge like me.
[243:48.84]Yeah, let's go.
[243:54.46]Take a lonely lizard out on a practice date.
[243:56.79]But to decide where to go, what to do, and how you end the evening.
[244:02.38]Great.
[244:02.52]How do you feel about a change of setting?
[244:07.30]Let's head over to my workplace and you can help me out there.
[244:09.17]Alright.
[244:11.45]What the fuck?
[244:15.75]Followed calls of the Alligator International School for Gifted Youths.
[244:21.01]Kids are on break right now, so it's only us lonely administrators.
[244:25.59]Me, I'm the lonely one.
[244:26.99]I need a big favor from you.
[244:29.29]You see, I have a meet, I have a meet cute tomorrow.
[244:32.31]And I don't know what to do or say or feel.
[244:34.74]My friend Karen, who works in the front office, set me up with a friend of hers.
[244:41.03]I'm sorry.
[244:42.63]I'm not usually the blind date type, but she says he's really dreamy.
[244:47.35]Tall, which I like, and big, which I also like.
[244:51.06]Broad shoulders.
[244:52.64]She says he's cool, quiet type, but he has a sense of humor and a big heart.
[244:58.52]And between you and me, she said he's a real dragon in the Dojima, if you catch my drift.
[245:04.54]I wonder what she told him about me.
[245:07.71]All this negative thinking is messing with my mojo.
[245:10.64]You seem like the strong, silent type.
[245:12.76]And you're cute enough that it intimidates me just a little.
[245:16.44]Please, you gotta help me practice for my big date.
[245:19.28]I need a boost of confidence, and I need it now.
[245:24.26]Yay!
[245:24.56]I mean, uh, cool, thanks.
[245:28.05]Karen arranged it all with my date.
[245:30.15]We're going on an adventure first.
[245:32.15]Then out to dinner.
[245:33.25]Then afterwards.
[245:34.95]Who knows?
[245:41.78]Laughter.
[245:43.22]So, um, what kind of adventure would you like to take me on?
[245:46.70]It's me.
[245:48.88]I would like to take you to a trip to the beach.
[245:52.74]Great, let's go.
[245:53.96]Well, come on.
[245:54.54]I can't pretend we're going somewhere if we don't go somewhere.
[245:56.78]The whole school is empty.
[245:59.08]Don't worry.
[246:04.16]Hey, the beach is pretty nice this time of year.
[246:07.36]That's a sweet idea.
[246:09.25]I know it's not really the beach.
[246:10.55]We're playing pretend, remember?
[246:13.05]It's only our first date.
[246:14.99]I didn't bring a towel.
[246:16.19]Can I take that again?
[246:19.26]Can I do that take again?
[246:20.36]Plus, we're going to dinner later.
[246:27.70]Am I going to be all sandy at the restaurant?
[246:30.42]Oh, you're okay with walking along the boardwalk.
[246:33.77]Well, that's nice.
[246:35.96]My mystery date probably looks great in swim trunks, though.
[246:38.60]This is fine, actually.
[246:41.44]I'm glad we're doing this.
[246:43.19]It's been a while since I've been on a real date.
[246:44.97]Like, with an itinerary.
[246:47.79]Everyone I date these days just wants to watch a TV show on an old couch.
[246:52.03]Don't get me wrong, I'm above staying in and getting cozy.
[246:54.97]But I think a first date should be really special, you know?
[246:58.34]Hmm, what's this?
[247:00.48]You brought me a present?
[247:02.36]But I didn't bring you anything.
[247:04.52]Well, that is a change of path.
[247:06.72]Old-fashioned, but in a nice way.
[247:08.87]Gimme gimme.
[247:11.85]I got you a cute toy.
[247:26.77]Oh, look at that.
[247:27.61]Thank you.
[247:27.95]I'll have to find a nice place to put it.
[247:29.95]I'm getting a little hungry.
[247:31.51]Do you mind if we head to the dinner?
[247:32.69]A reservation?
[247:34.54]Should I keep going or are people going to hate me?
[247:36.54]People are going to literally leave the channel forever.
[247:42.18]Alright, I need a mod to run a poll.
[247:45.90]And the poll says, are you going to leave if I keep doing this?
[247:49.43]The answer is yes or no.
[247:55.35]It's a simple yes or no question.
[248:01.22]Let me give you a quick little taste of what it's going to be like.
[248:03.34]A reservation?
[248:07.35]Wow, you came prepared.
[248:09.79]Just a quick little taste of what you can expect.
[248:17.83]There's a quick little taste about it.

[248:55.15]I now am going to pivot to every old man character in every anime that's ever released.
[249:01.82]We'll really be able to get to know each other.
[249:04.60]It's so nice that you have a local place too.
[249:06.82]I've been living in this city for five years and I finally have my coffee place.
[249:10.90]Oh yeah, it was a big adjustment.
[249:12.76]The city is always moving.
[249:15.46]I was living across the river in Alligator, New Jersey back then.
[249:18.55]Please don't ask me about those dark times.
[249:22.11]There definitely weren't any cute snoots in Alligator Hoboken, not like you.
[249:28.10]Now we're leaving.
[249:36.36]Alright, I will switch back to the protagonist.
[249:46.15]There definitely weren't any cute snoots in Alligator Hoboken, not like you.
[249:49.65]Hey, let's head over to the restaurant.
[249:54.90]Oh, this place is nice.
[249:56.24]I like that decor isn't too pretentious.
[249:59.30]So do you come here often?
[250:01.14]You're so right.
[250:01.80]I barely make it out of the house myself these days.

[250:11.21]Give me a compliment.

[250:22.16]I know a lot of you said no, but I feel like a lot of you actually meant yes.
[250:49.92]Should I keep going?
[250:50.40]This is going to literally ruin my career.
[250:52.00]I think this is going to end the whole, I think this is going to ruin my career.
[250:57.95]Stop laughing.
[250:58.55]This is precisely why I wanted to practice.
[251:01.15]What I'm trying to say, I'm having a really good time with you.
[251:05.05]If you don't have any plans after dinner, want to come to the spring festival with me?
[251:12.19]I think I'm ruining, I think my career is over.

[251:28.38]There's food, carnival games, and the whole thing ends with a big fireworks show.
[251:33.11]What do you say we split the check and head over?
[251:35.71]Flag down the waiter then.
[251:37.21]Let's get out of here.
[251:37.99]Double down always.

[252:54.06]I really wanted to have a good time.
[252:56.46]To be honest, I wasn't sure I was even going to come out tonight.
[252:59.26]I'm doing it on my own.
[253:00.97]A lot of people are scared of me, would you believe me?
[253:03.43]It's not like I'm some kind of scary gangster roaming the streets at night and showing up whenever repeatedly challenging the same person to endless street brawls while slowly building my reputation as a mad dog who will fight anyone and anything, relentlessly punishing all who stand in the way of my personal goals.
[253:20.86]Hey, it looks like the fireworks are starting.
[253:23.36]Come with me.
[253:24.40]I know the perfect place to watch.

[254:01.33]Mod, should I quit stream?

[254:05.71]You seem like a great person and it was really cool hanging out with you.
[254:08.42]We should do this again sometime.
