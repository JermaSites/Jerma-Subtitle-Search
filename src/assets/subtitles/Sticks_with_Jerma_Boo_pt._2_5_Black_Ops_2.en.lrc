[00:01.79]Yeah.
[00:01.99]There we go.
[00:02.27]I'm in now.
[00:02.65]I'm in now.
[00:04.32]Alright.
[00:05.40]Here we go.
[00:08.38]Oh my god.
[00:08.90]Who's that?
[00:10.40]I just got banged straight off the spawn.
[00:17.05]Okay.
[00:18.03]Is he listening in on our conversation right now?
[00:20.01]Is he listening in?
[00:22.65]That guy knows to bank you.
[00:23.59]I'm going the wrong way.
[00:25.49]There's nobody down here.
[00:26.22]Yeah.
[00:27.31]Oh, wait.
[00:27.75]There we go.
[00:28.31]Got somebody.
[00:29.11]Yeah, I banked him back.
[00:30.53]That's what you get, baby.
[00:31.87]This guy's trying to shoot the hell out of me.
[00:34.55]That guy's also banked.
[00:36.27]I should go for regular kills, but I just banked people instead.
[00:39.29]It's way more fun.
[00:42.54]It's way more fun that way.
[00:45.18]No!
[00:45.44]Tomahawk from across the map.
[00:47.12]Who's gonna get hit with it across the map?
[00:51.22]He was being sneaky.
[00:52.58]Gotcha.
[00:54.00]How did I not hit... Wow.
[00:56.37]I... I don't understand how that happened.
[01:00.49]On that guy's screen, I was standing... Oh, shit.

[01:02.79]Stop, Boo.
[01:03.60]Stop, Boo.
[01:04.32]You was standing still when I looked at you, and then the other guy came up, and you moved.

[04:00.93]Can you please tell me?
[04:01.91]Now I'm going to find you.
[04:05.55]I backed both of you.
[04:07.91]Did you bank both of us?
[04:08.87]Yes, I did.
[04:09.99]Oh, you are the worst friend ever.
[04:12.72]Well, I pride myself on that, though.
[04:16.46]I pride myself on banking my friends over and over again until they have no more money.
[04:22.30]Well, points in this case.
[04:24.42]No, who... Well, I'm still rocking 110 points.
[04:28.02]So, guys, now that we got 30 seconds on the clock, I just want to take this time to tell you guys to just keep fighting.
[04:34.03]Just hang in there, guys.
[04:35.65]It's not about winning sticks and stone games.
[04:37.81]It's about the fight, you know?
[04:39.51]It's about the struggle.
[04:41.56]of continuously just trying over and over again to try and perfect your own craft.
[04:46.04]We're all different, guys.
[04:47.26]You know?
[04:47.70]We're all different.
[04:49.58]And, uh... We can't... We can't... We can't just... We can't just win every game.
[04:56.17]No, we can't win every game, guys.
[04:58.25]Just hang in there.
[04:59.93]Hang in there and keep trying.
[05:01.37]And maybe we can come back for game three and maybe you can win, guys.
[05:04.73]But don't give up, okay?
[05:06.97]Don't give up.
[05:07.89]Please vote Orm for president.
[05:08.97]You suck.
[05:11.41]I'm so happy I banked both of you, like, back to back.
[05:13.83]No, I wasn't hiding.
[05:16.80]I got a recording to prove it.
[05:18.28]You got the bank on me because we were in, like, a friggin' hallway.
[05:21.52]Okay.
[05:21.82]We were in a hallway together, and you just, like, lobbed it in.
[05:24.04]You didn't even know I was there.
[05:25.38]Okay.
[05:26.22]Okay.
[05:27.58]Come on.
[05:28.04]I was 14 and 9.
