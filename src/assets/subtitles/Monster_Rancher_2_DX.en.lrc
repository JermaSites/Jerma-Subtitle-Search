[ve:60.16.100]

[01:28.06]Is this game out yet?
[01:28.66]Is the game released yet?
[01:30.63]4.30?
[01:30.65]No?
[01:32.27]Shit.
[01:40.29]Where the fuck does this game come out?
[01:44.02]Real voice?
[01:44.72]What?
[01:45.40]What's wrong?
[01:50.08]Maybe in 30 minutes?
[01:50.82]Alright.
[01:51.16]Well, what?
[01:51.60]Okay, so... Hey, first of all... Hello.
[01:54.36]Hi, everybody.
[01:55.54]Okay.
[01:57.86]How you doing?
[01:58.76]Good to see you again.
[02:00.80]Today, plan is we're going to play Monster Rancher 2.
[02:06.95]I'm trying to hold my excitement.
[02:10.71]This is one of my favorite games ever.
[02:14.21]Fart in the mic.
[02:14.91]You got it!
[02:17.55]Why do so many people want streamers to fart in mics?
[02:21.95]Is it funny?
[02:22.79]Oh, I saw a clip.
[02:23.87]I've completely forgotten, but let's talk about this real quick.
[02:26.93]I completely forgot that... So, during the Dollhouse stream, there was a lot going on.
[02:33.75]There was a lot of stuff that we recorded, right?
[02:36.53]Like, the costume selection stuff, right?
[02:39.63]That was all pre-recorded.
[02:41.29]And then there was stuff going on on the set, and my mind was not, like, watching the stream, and I completely forgot, and it took until...
[02:48.88]I got reminded of this weird thing where I spun around in the middle of the costume change scene and do this fake spin fart loud into the microphone thing with my mouth.
[03:01.07]And I had a reaction to that a few months ago, but then I forgot about it, and I saw it a few days ago.
[03:09.51]And I was like, why is that here?
[03:13.54]I didn't want that in the video, but it's just there.
[03:17.58]I didn't want that in the stream.
[03:22.00]But anyways, who cares?
[03:25.12]Let us see your face.
[03:26.00]I know, I told you.
[03:26.92]I'm sitting here waiting for the release of Monster Rancher.
[03:29.49]And I'm going to play Monster Rancher 2.
[03:30.61]And by the way, who cares?
[03:33.07]I do.
[03:33.37]It was my fart.
[03:36.43]For all the new Germamites that are in attendance right now.
[03:41.65]I've played this game before.
[03:43.81]This is a re-release of the old PlayStation 1 games.
[03:48.45]I can't.
[03:48.91]I'm so excited.
[03:49.55]I can't wait to play it.
[03:51.93]Be prepared to be more emotionally invested in this than anything else you've ever done in your life.
[04:04.08]Let me move the microphone.
[04:06.48]No emotion for an hour?
[04:10.40]I feel like I'm sitting in the line at Best Buy waiting for the new iPhone.
[04:14.05]I just want to play.
[04:16.23]Alright, hold on.
[04:16.73]Should I just do no emotion until the game comes out?
[04:22.57]Why did this turn into a weird protest stream?
[04:25.68]I'm not protesting the game.
[04:27.92]No, I'm just waiting for the game to come out.
[04:37.44]Turn on the cam and smoke cigarettes.
[04:43.26]I don't want to talk too much about the game because I want you to be surprised by how fun it is.
[04:47.56]Apparently the port's pretty good, too, from what I've heard.
[04:51.29]It's almost 3 a.m.
[04:52.63]Yeah, what time is it?
[04:53.57]When is it?
[04:53.91]Okay, when is the next region midnight?
[04:57.51]Does anybody know?
[04:59.05]Like, where is it 1135 right now?
[05:05.00]If you look at your clock and if it's 1135 p.m., tell me where you are.
[05:10.04]What region?
[05:11.96]Ireland, it's 1235.
[05:12.44]Okay, so what is this?
[05:14.36]What is this release?
[05:19.04]It's 1 a.m.
[05:19.34]1135 where?
[05:22.03]Oh, it's 1135 AM.
[05:23.17]That's not right.
[05:24.51]No, I'm talking general region.
[05:26.25]Region.
[05:28.05]It's 1135 AM in Australia.
[05:30.14]I'm looking for regions.
[05:31.34]It's not even out yet.
[05:32.12]I know.
[05:33.72]So look, just fucking, okay, whatever.
[05:35.82]Ask, ask me, ask me whatever you want.
[05:39.79]Okay?
[05:42.59]I'm just fine.
[05:43.11]I'm sitting here until it comes out.
[05:52.18]Whole Europe is after 0-0?
[05:53.48]You look unhealthy.
[05:59.93]Nobody said that.
[06:00.59]I did.
[06:05.80]I can stall as long as I want.
[06:11.37]Why don't you believe in time zones?
[06:13.36]I do believe in time zones.
[06:14.28]You know, okay, you're asking the guy if he believes in time zones?
[06:18.08]The guy that has to respond to the EU viewers that yell at him because I stream too late?
[06:23.92]You're talking to that guy.
[06:25.59]You don't think I know time zones?
[06:32.81]Seriously, what is this time?
[06:35.83]I don't know.
[06:36.21]I'm waiting for Monster Rancher to come out.
[06:38.48]It probably doesn't even come out.
[06:42.78]It's probably like an error on Steam that the game comes out, like today.
[06:51.26]It says on Steam that the game releases in less than an hour.
[06:55.35]And that was an hour ago.
[06:56.93]That was at like, that was at 4 o'clock.
[07:01.55]What's your skincare routine?
[07:07.17]My eyes!
[07:10.43]You look, uh, you look greasy?
[07:11.73]Thanks.
[07:16.64]Oh, you guys want- Hey, I'll show you something interesting.
[07:19.36]I'll show you something interesting.
[07:21.18]Okay, so this is my- I had to do this today.
[07:24.12]I had to put on a t-shirt.
[07:25.14]I had to put a shirt on today.
[07:28.14]Your tags are inaccurate.
[07:31.35]What do you mean?
[07:37.31]No pants.
[07:37.97]Well, no, I do have pants on.
[07:39.49]But this is like the I'm in a Zoom call professional Andy.
[07:43.99]Just make sure, uh, just make sure you don't stand up so they see your Darth Vader pajama pants.
[07:54.33]Look at this!
[07:54.75]Ah, look!
[07:54.97]What's up, guys?
[07:59.22]Yeah, V-neck.
[08:00.18]I got a cool V-neck on.
[08:03.02]Don't stand up.
[08:04.40]Otherwise, they'll know.
[08:07.70]You have one of the three shirts you own.
[08:14.53]I need to go clo- I- look.
[08:16.23]Can I- I have to talk about this.
[08:18.75]Listen to me.
[08:19.79]I need to know if anybody else relates to this.
[08:22.26]So I have... I have- I don't like- okay.
[08:28.93]I own a shitload of really nice clothes that I've purchased.
[08:32.59]I bought a bunch of clothing, I went to a bunch of nice places, bought a bunch of nice tees, really nice button-up shirts and shit, right?
[08:39.91]They are all wrinkled to fucking hell in the closet.
[08:43.97]I have not worn them once because I don't want to mess them up, I don't want to ruin them.
[08:47.87]I always feel like if I put my nice clothes on, and I have a bunch of it, that I will somehow sweat through it or drop mustard on it or something.
[08:57.13]I never want to wear those clothes.
[08:59.60]don't know why and they they seriously look like they look like they're in a vacuum sealed bag because of how up and scrunched and wrinkled they are I don't think any dry cleaning would work I think I literally have to get new clothes because they're so wrinkled up this is not going to happen I tried to iron one of them once and all it did was make make like a bunch of lines and it was bad
[09:28.42]In the pre-stream, you promised Mario Golf.
[09:31.35]I was shit-faced when I promised Mario Golf, like, six months ago, so sorry.
[09:34.93]What'd you say?
[09:41.95]Don't eat mustard, then.
[09:43.05]How often are you eating mustard?
[09:44.29]Are you wearing really nice clothes to a ball game?
[09:47.69]No, I don't know.
[09:48.29]I always just feel like, okay.
[09:50.65]I feel like I sweat a lot, and, like, I'm gonna get those, like, orange stains under the nice clothes.
[09:58.81]What causes those orange stains, by the way?
[10:01.87]It doesn't happen to me, but if it did, why does that happen?
[10:08.94]Game out yet?
[10:10.96]No.
[10:14.62]I'm in the wrong category, too.
[10:15.74]Yeah, I gotta move to just chatting for like 20 minutes.
[10:20.78]Or wait, is it technically a Monster Rancher 2 stream if I'm talking about how pumped and hyped I am for Monster Rancher 2?
[10:26.62]You look red.
[10:27.82]I know.
[10:28.06]Because I'm very flustered.
[10:33.58]Why did you sweat orange?
[10:34.52]No, it's after when it dries.
[10:41.50]It's aluminum.
[10:43.12]It's an allergic reaction.
[10:44.52]Huh.
[10:48.26]Jerma, you still owe me $4 million for stealing and crashing my jetpack.
[10:52.06]Jetpacks aren't real.
[10:58.37]How do you look so nice today?
[10:59.55]Who did you kill for the youth today?
[11:03.17]I shaved.
[11:06.65]So I killed the millions of tiny little hairs that were on my face.
[11:19.22]You look 15 years younger.
[11:20.40]Guys, I shaved my face.
[11:21.38]This is a fresh shave.
[11:27.76]How come you're de-aging?
[11:28.92]I'm not de-aging.
[11:30.46]I'm... This is just what my face looks like after I shave.
[11:36.02]I could use a haircut, too.
[11:38.61]Your face looks red.
[11:39.41]I know, because my white balance is wrong.
[11:41.75]And it's... I'm a little warm.
[11:45.73]My white balance is screwed up.
[11:46.73]This wall... This wall is not, like, green, okay?
[11:50.61]It's like white.
[11:52.60]It's kind of like an off-white.
[12:02.72]This chat's going too fast.
[12:06.43]What's on the Reddit shelf?
[12:08.56]Uh, on the Reddit shelf we have...
[12:11.36]I've kind of been doing a little collection here.
[12:14.00]So I'll move this way.
[12:16.10]Every major stream... People have maybe been paying attention to this.
[12:20.39]But every major stream, a prop, like a little piece of it, goes up there.
[12:24.65]And eventually, I wanted to get to the point where all those Funko Pops get removed.
[12:29.89]I'm going to start replacing the Funko Pops with one little prop from a major stream.
[12:36.27]So hopefully over the next year or two, that shelf is fucking overflowing.
[12:41.98]It's a nice little reminder to walk in and be like, oh yeah, that one, that one, that was fun, that was fun, that was fun, that was fun.
[12:53.02]The geodes there, yeah.
[12:54.20]Most of them, all the major streams, the big event streams are up there.
[12:58.60]With the exception of maybe, I don't know, maybe one.
[13:04.01]He's holding on to the past.
[13:07.37]No, I would be holding on to the past if this was like 30 years from now.
[13:12.57]And I come in and I pick up the 985 plaque.
[13:15.33]And I'm like, oh, I remember when I did that.
[13:18.47]No.
[13:23.91]It happened like six months ago.
[13:30.19]Remember when?
[13:31.23]What was your favorite stream?
[13:32.21]I don't have a favorite.
[13:33.67]Game out yet?
[13:34.43]No.
[13:37.72]You need to get the Deathwing Funko Pop.
[13:40.00]Why would I do that?
[13:41.06]I don't give a shit about that game.
[13:43.65]I don't care at all about Deathwing.
[13:46.81]Why would I ever get the Deathwing Funko Pop?
[13:51.13]I haven't played World of Warcraft since I swore off of it like six years ago when you watched the Meltdown stream.
[14:01.06]What did you say?
[14:03.37]Do a cool camera effect.
[14:04.79]No, we have 15 minutes before I can, I hope it unlocks.
[14:14.20]Okay, this is like me waiting for the iPhone at Best Buy.
[14:18.32]Except Best Buy didn't tell me, didn't say anything about what time the iPhone was coming out.
[14:23.57]I'm just here.
[14:24.07]Excuse me, sir.
[14:26.99]We didn't like tell you that like the game was, the iPhone was going to be out today.
[14:30.93]Yeah, I'm just here.
[14:31.47]I'm going to wait for it.
[14:33.93]What if it's like three weeks from now?
[14:36.78]Yeah, that's fine.
[14:38.52]I'll just hang out.
[14:41.78]Do you like McDonald's?
[14:42.42]I love McDonald's.
[14:42.92]I remember how's TikTok treating you?
[14:54.31]You tell me.
[15:01.80]What's my favorite bug?
[15:03.24]Praying Mantis, probably.
[15:10.05]Yeah, we're doing the Game Awards tomorrow.
[15:11.67]Absolutely.
[15:14.33]That's also at 4.30.
[15:15.87]Hopefully that actually starts at 4.30.
[15:17.39]Do I have any vinyls?
[15:22.18]No.
[15:24.50]I don't have any vinyls.
[15:26.22]Hold on.
[15:26.96]What's going on here?
[15:28.04]I need to make sure of something here.
[15:33.13]Okay.
[15:34.13]Should I just switch to just chatting?
[15:35.39]Like, I'm just sitting here.
[15:37.28]I'm not gonna sit in the wrong category for, like, fucking an hour.
[15:40.28]No more swearing, either.
[15:45.90]Just chatting.
[15:46.62]Return to the farm.
[15:50.05]Whatever that means.
[15:53.85]I swear to God, if I change category and it comes out in two minutes, I'm gonna be mad.
[15:59.08]Now, alright, if it doesn't come out at 5, then I will just leave this category.
[16:03.08]Number 1.
[16:10.19]If it isn't ready, can you play the Manos Hands of Fate game?
[16:13.19]No, no thank you.
[16:18.27]Do something wacky?
[16:18.95]I don't think these pants will allow me to do that.
[16:25.02]I could give you a TikTok, though.
[16:27.59]You want to talk about world's greatest TikToker?
[16:30.57]I could prove it to you.
[16:34.17]Can I stand up?
[16:36.19]This is not inappropriate, right?
[16:37.71]It's a pair of pants that I have underwear on.
[16:39.79]Why do I have to even say that?
[16:44.35]I sometimes forget how many people I'm talking to.
[16:46.21]My mother's pissed probably.
[16:47.41]She's probably like, Jeremy.
[16:49.39]I just heard my mother's voice.
[16:51.07]Go, Jeremy.
[16:56.33]I can show you TikTok.
[16:57.69]Fine.
[16:58.53]You want to see the next fucking big TikTok dance?
[17:00.19]I'll give it to you right now.
[17:01.85]Alright, fine.
[17:05.85]Okay.
[17:06.49]I've trended on TikTok three different times in the last fucking three years.
[17:11.02]Okay?
[17:13.92]Bring this one to the fucking front page.
[17:16.12]Call this one the goddamn orangutan.
[17:22.32]See you on the front page.
[17:38.93]Holy shit.
[17:40.19]It's already gone viral.
[17:42.89]It's already viral.
[17:43.97]I didn't even do it.
[17:44.57]I just did that for five seconds.
[17:45.74]You think I could be on TikTok.com?
[17:56.46]What the fuck did that guy do?
[17:57.74]That's the latest TikTok craze.
[17:59.54]It's called the orangutan.
[18:06.04]You keep talking.
[18:06.52]Just make it already.
[18:08.45]I'm not gonna make a TikTok.
[18:19.58]Jerma, I would... Jerma, I would rather see you in the hospital than on TikTok.
[18:30.14]Holy shit, dude.
[18:31.34]What the fuck?
[18:37.91]Can he be toxic?
[18:38.67]Sure, fine.
[18:40.79]No, I don't want to do that.
[18:43.34]I'm too excited.
[18:48.62]By the way, important, the New Year's Eve nominations are still open.
[18:58.13]Still open.
[19:00.89]If you have something this year that you thought was really awful or really cool, go to the Discord.
[19:08.07]I'm winded from doing the over-acid tough dance.
[19:15.16]We've got 10 minutes until I have to panic and figure out what the hell I'm gonna do for the next few hours.
[19:21.22]Be funny!
[19:21.77]I just did the orangutan and that was fucking hilarious!
[19:29.55]Don't you remember?
[19:41.03]This is why I should never fucking go live unless I exactly am ready to stream the game.
[19:45.75]You guys, that's why I don't do like IRL.
[19:48.35]It's because I can't be trusted with anything.
[19:50.64]That was trendy, but it wasn't funny.
[19:51.92]That was trendy.
[19:58.90]Why am I so red?
[20:00.92]Why?
[20:01.22]Dude, I don't understand.
[20:02.66]Why do I have so much blood in my skin?
[20:05.72]Why am I like this?
[20:10.29]I don't think I really am, though.
[20:13.41]Does that mean I have too much blood?
[20:16.25]All over my whole face and shit?
[20:17.61]What does that mean?
[20:20.87]You're regressing to 2011 Jerma.
[20:22.77]Yeah, the Jerma that was red in every video.
[20:26.03]But I was burnt.
[20:27.97]That was burnt.
[20:30.67]I don't know why I decided to turn the face cam on and do videos when I was just burnt every time.
[20:40.89]Was it?
[20:42.49]We've seen the orangutan, but can we see the... I don't know what that is.
[20:50.58]You're very sweaty.
[20:54.52]I'm not.
[20:54.88]I'm not, though.
[20:55.96]I'm just red.
[20:57.66]Nine minutes.
[21:00.49]Nine minutes.
[21:01.49]Remain.
[21:07.69]Why is your bed on the floor behind you?
[21:10.31]That's a dog bed.
[21:12.91]Or that could be very far away.
[21:15.61]Right?
[21:15.77]What if I just freaked everybody out right now and I got up and I started running and walking towards that and I started getting smaller and like five minutes later I get in that bed and lie in it like I'm this big.
[21:26.26]That would have been hilarious.
[21:33.54]Remember, it comes out tomorrow.
[21:36.07]But look at Steam.
[21:37.57]I'm telling you, look at Steam says the game releases in less than an hour.
[21:42.34]It said 23 hours an hour ago.
[21:45.48]This is not copium.
[21:48.82]This is factual information on the Steam website.
[21:57.73]It's going to be five.
[21:59.43]I think so.
[22:02.95]You already fit in that perfectly.
[22:05.15]I gotta fix this.
[22:05.71]I don't know why I'm so red.
[22:06.69]I'm like turning purple.
[22:10.63]Am I?
[22:10.91]Or is that just my shitty monitor?
[22:13.43]I have no idea.
[22:19.82]You're bruising.
[22:20.60]It's because your lights are too blue.
[22:26.74]Let me see what I can do.
[22:27.50]Hold on.
[22:28.06]Bear with me here.
[22:38.11]Okay, white balance.
[22:39.13]Let's change it.
[22:41.19]Oh, there we go.
[22:42.55]I'm actually, like, blue now.
[22:48.67]I don't... Do I even have human skin?
[22:51.55]Why is it, like, so hard for me to white balance my face?
[22:59.02]I don't get it.
[23:05.27]I promise I'm not like this, like red and purple.
[23:07.71]I've made like videos on TikTok before.
[23:10.74]I'm not this red and purple.
[23:15.08]Why do I have so much blood?
[23:16.02]I don't know.
[23:16.50]I don't know.
[23:20.46]Six minutes until we don't get to play the game.
[23:26.44]He's so scary.
[23:27.26]I'm
[23:30.90]Alright, give me some questions.
[23:32.06]This is supposed to be an ask me anything before Monster Rancher.
[23:34.18]Ask me anything about Monster Rancher.
[23:35.84]How's that sound?
[23:37.52]Because this is a Monster Rancher 2 stream.
[23:47.02]Why does your mouth look like an optical illusion image?
[23:49.32]Like the ones with Obama where one version's facial features are upside down.
[23:52.30]I don't know.
[23:55.06]My cells split differently in the womb.
[23:57.51]I don't know.
[23:58.29]I have no idea what you mean.
[24:03.48]That was actually kind of funny.
[24:04.28]Alright, what did you say?
[24:07.36]You're still going to play the Monster Breeder?
[24:09.86]Yes.
[24:13.38]You like Ranch?
[24:14.48]Not really.
[24:15.78]It's okay.
[24:18.36]How old were you when you first played Monster Rancher?
[24:20.50]Now, that is a good question.
[24:22.98]I believe I was 13, 14, PlayStation 1.
[24:25.49]I loved it.
[24:31.27]They replaced the CD system.
[24:32.79]I am not going to give a judgment on it until I play it in approximately five minutes.
[24:38.70]What are your thoughts on Honey Mustard?
[24:43.00]I love it.
[24:46.84]Why do you look like that?
[24:50.86]Why do you look like that?
[24:55.97]Is this 2D or 3D?
[24:56.43]It's 3D.
[25:01.82]Why is your face red in Monster Rancher?
[25:03.82]When was the last time that you touched grass with your fingertips?
[25:14.17]Does soil count?
[25:17.95]Like, does dirt count?
[25:20.45]Because I've done a bunch of stuff with plants over the last, like, few months.
[25:25.24]That should count.
[25:29.24]Four minutes.
[25:32.96]What am I drinking?
[25:33.34]That's a nice coffee.
[25:39.41]What did you say?
[25:41.17]Why did I see you blink like a reptile two minutes ago?
[25:43.85]I don't know.
[25:44.77]I'm really blinky.
[25:47.63]I'm really blinky and I lick my lips all the time.
[25:49.85]So maybe I am a lizard.
[25:50.75]I don't know.
[25:53.93]Your straw is longer than your forearm.
[25:58.36]Holy shit, this is huge.
[26:01.47]This is, this is huge!
[26:03.93]Why is this so huge?
[26:07.49]Oh my god, how are you, why are you so perceptive?
[26:10.25]What?
[26:12.15]It's... It is fucking gigantic!
[26:17.15]What, this is probably for like a 40 ounce drink.
[26:21.79]I actually, I'm really happy about it though, because I don't have to like move, I can just go like this.
[26:29.66]Takes too long to get to your mouth?
[26:30.86]No, it doesn't.
[26:31.40]Perpetual kinetic energy gets it there fast.
[26:40.88]I'm not even that red.
[26:41.66]It's just this shitty monitor.
[26:42.62]How many people are in here?
[26:47.23]There's like almost 12,000 people here.
[26:50.91]Is it out?
[26:55.41]Your straw is as long as an oil pipeline.
[27:02.96]Play a game already.
[27:03.88]I'm so... I hope this releases in three minutes.
[27:10.37]Please release in three minutes.
[27:11.55]What'd you say?
[27:18.37]Are you hip with the kids?
[27:21.39]Talk to me in an hour when the orangutan is trending on the front page of the app where you cannot be over the age of 35 to use it.
[27:46.41]That's an ego- Egotistical.
[27:53.22]What the f- This monitor is- You know what?
[27:56.04]It is this monitor.
[27:56.80]Remember when I thought that like a green like vegetable was gray?
[28:01.29]Or something?
[28:02.11]Because this monitor's colors are all screwed up.
[28:07.84]Two minutes!
[28:17.63]Yo, dude, where's my DoorDash order?
[28:20.19]I don't know.
[28:24.55]Why would I know that?
[28:28.51]There's a bug on my face.
[28:30.07]Good.
[28:32.59]Okay.
[28:36.03]60 seconds, come on!
[28:37.79]Come on, come on, come on.
[28:40.21]Monster Rancher, Monster Rancher 2.
[28:42.75]If we all say it collectively at the same time, it's gonna happen.
[28:45.61]Ready?
[28:45.77]Ready?
[28:47.54]Monster Rancher 2.
[28:49.24]Monster Rancher 2.
[28:50.90]Monster Rancher 2.
[28:52.58]Monster Rancher 2.

[28:59.69]Monster Rancher 2.
[29:01.39]Monster Rancher 2.
[29:02.23]I feel like I'm at a camp.
[29:05.39]I feel as enthusiastic.
[29:07.95]Monster Rancher 2.
[29:09.79]Monster Rancher 2.
[29:10.63]Come on!
[29:16.67]This game will... It just says coming soon now.
[29:50.55]Wait, that's normal?
[29:51.29]It's normal?
[29:55.69]Somebody said that's normal.
[29:56.87]Does that mean it's about to come out?
[29:58.52]Like right now?
[30:02.00]Restart Steam.
[30:02.84]Is it out?
[30:09.26]It's out?
[30:12.59]Restart Steam.
[30:13.21]Alright, I'm going to restart Steam.
[30:15.69]Oh shit, it's out.
[30:20.22]This deserves an orangutan!
[30:40.17]It's not even out!
[30:41.21]Where is it?
[30:45.51]I just... Are you lying to me?
[30:50.58]Come on!
[30:51.14]It's out!
[30:51.92]Install it already!
[30:56.00]Somebody says, yikes.
[30:59.54]No, it's out.
[31:00.20]It's out.
[31:00.52]It's out.
[31:01.77]Come on.
[31:03.63]Holy shit.
[31:04.53]I can't wait.
[31:05.09]Fucking install it!
[31:14.34]Hurry up and install it!
[31:22.93]Come on!
[31:26.69]Dude, you need to chill.
[31:28.15]Yeah, I know.
[31:29.33]Dude, the iPhone just came out!
[31:32.31]The iPhone just came out, and I'm in line to get the iPhone!
[31:41.80]Are you on meth?
[31:43.12]That's fucking funny.
[31:44.16]We did a drug test like a year or two ago, and the only thing that came up was cocaine.
[31:48.64]So, like, I mean, that person's fucking wrong.
[31:54.83]Why can't... Come on!
[31:55.91]Download!
[31:58.65]Wait a minute, hold on a second.
[32:01.62]Why is this fucked up?
[32:09.26]Shit.
[32:09.58]Alright, hold on.
[32:10.12]I'm restarting it again.
[32:13.68]I don't do fucking drugs, guys.
[32:15.82]Marijuana is the only thing I've ever done.
[32:19.02]I drink alcohol like six times a year.
[32:23.86]Come on.
[32:26.34]Is it installing?
[32:32.03]Oh, dude, here it goes.
[32:34.53]Alright, my stream might crash because I can't, like, do two things at once.
[32:38.33]I might be downloading too fast.
[32:39.41]Let's see.
[32:39.69]Tell me if the stream crashes.
[32:50.04]I can't wait.
[32:50.66]I'm so happy.
[32:51.28]I get to play Monster Rancher 2.
[32:53.44]Monster Rancher 2.
[32:55.18]Monster Rancher 2.
[32:58.55]I need my headphones in.
[33:03.71]Alright, open it.
[33:05.01]Turn the volume down in case it's too loud.
[33:07.73]I'm opening it for the first time.
[33:08.87]It actually is out.
[33:15.78]It was really loud.
[33:18.22]Can you hear this?
[33:20.24]That's so loud.
[33:22.06]I got scared.
[33:26.94]Turn this, turn it down.
[33:30.13]There's no audio for you?
[33:31.17]Okay, well, there is now.
[33:32.87]I'm sorry, I just made it loud for you.
[33:34.13]That was my fault.
[33:36.37]Alright, Monster Rancher 2.
[33:38.31]Monster... This is... I gotta go to the options here.
[33:43.81]Sound on.
[33:45.63]What is FF?
[33:47.31]FF?
[33:48.77]Resolution settings.
[33:49.49]There we go.
[33:53.02]I want... Full screen.
[34:00.24]What the fuck?
[34:01.82]Full screen?
[34:02.30]How come it's not full screen?
[34:06.06]Oh shit, I didn't have a controller.
[34:07.08]Okay, I got a controller.
[34:07.88]Stop.
[34:12.65]Alright.
[34:16.79]Let's chill.
[34:18.63]Gonna fucking hang out.
[34:19.73]Play Monster Ranch 2.
[34:20.55]It's a fucking pretty fun game, dude.
[34:24.36]Minimize the face cam.
[34:25.48]I have to make sure the game works first.
[34:29.16]Why can't this... Full screen.
[34:31.58]I want it full screen.
[34:32.50]I don't know what FF is, but I'm just gonna say okay.
[34:37.37]Confirm.
[34:37.65]I don't think that did anything.
[34:43.19]Oh, Jesus.
[34:43.63]I don't know what's going on.
[34:45.95]Okay, hold on.
[34:46.45]Let me capture it.
[34:49.34]Oh, shit.
[34:50.24]I can't wait.
[34:50.64]This is fucking unbelievable.
[34:55.00]Alright.
[34:56.04]So, listen to me.
[35:04.65]I can't fucking wait, dude.
[35:07.95]Here it is!
[35:14.74]I just looked so pretend interesting.
[35:19.28]I'll do face cam for 10 minutes.
[35:22.20]And it's never going on ever again.
[35:29.55]What happened to my hair?
[35:30.37]Why does my hair look so fluffy and weird?
[35:39.93]Okay, here we go.
[35:42.71]So, if you guys don't know anything about Monster Rancher, let's talk about it very, very quickly, very briefly.
[35:48.23]Monster Rancher.
[35:49.05]Where'd it go?
[35:52.83]Where'd it go?
[35:53.77]Why is it not being captured?
[35:56.27]What just happened?
[35:59.56]What?
[36:03.68]What the fuck is going on?
[36:11.62]What happened?
[36:16.48]Why is it doing this?
[36:17.04]Alright, I want to do new game.
[36:23.53]Why is this not showing up?
[36:31.13]You guys just saw it, right?
[36:33.07]There it is.
[36:39.33]You ready?
[36:40.55]Monster Rancher is a monster training and battle simulation game.
[36:46.48]This game takes place over the course of a few years, I think five to ten years on your ranch.
[36:51.04]And what happens is you get these monsters, you can breed them, and you fight in battles.
[36:56.35]And it's way better than Pokémon.
[36:58.69]Okay?
[36:59.35]Pokémon is not even close.
[37:01.53]Neither is digital monsters either.
[37:06.74]So what's going to happen here is I'm going to get into the game.
[37:08.44]I'm so fucking excited.
[37:09.36]Let's go.
[37:13.30]Please sign your name here.
[37:18.84]No, matches are open to public view.
[37:20.62]Do not include any personal info or offensive wording.
[37:22.96]Some words may not... Wait, there's online in this?
[37:27.42]Holy shit, really?
[37:35.19]Alright, what's my name?
[37:41.44]Which it'd be.
[37:41.80]I don't have to hurry up.
[37:47.31]Dean backs on.
[37:47.89]This is not the name of my monster.
[37:49.31]This is the trainer.
[37:50.17]I feel like there's a significant amount of lag.
[38:00.91]Okay.
[38:01.94]This is important.
[38:02.54]How about, um... Jax is cool.
[38:09.68]Sasuke is not going up there.
[38:15.13]The orangutan.
[38:16.68]No.
[38:17.84]There are orangutans in the game, though.
[38:19.72]A lot of you newer viewers, I have no idea just how fucking cool this game is.
[38:24.36]I'm about to change your whole life.
[38:26.96]We've played this before a few years ago.
[38:28.47]It's one of my favorite games.
[38:30.09]You're about to experience one of the coolest fucking games ever made.
[38:33.89]And I'm dead serious about that.
[38:35.55]Pay attention.
[38:38.80]Alright, it's just Jeremy.
[38:39.74]Jeremy.
[38:48.96]No, Jex is fine.
[38:51.90]Why is the X?
[38:52.44]What's with the X?
[38:55.04]Okay.
[38:57.75]How do I... That's interesting.
[39:02.93]Should I use the keyboard and mouse?
[39:06.37]That's the wrong X. How is it wrong?
[39:14.86]Jex.
[39:15.96]You will be a new trainer, right?
[39:19.03]We're going to have to take, you're gonna have to learn and type the test.
[39:23.83]Please answer these questions.
[39:27.45]I have never lied in my entire life.
[39:32.11]I lie all the time.
[39:36.21]The effort I put forth in reaching my goal is more important than the outcome.
[39:43.98]That depends.
[39:47.28]That depends.
[39:48.18]I'm going to say... I'm going to say... Can I just... Can I click the thing in the middle?
[39:51.53]I'm going to say yes.
[39:56.41]My dream can be realized as long as I do my best to achieve it.
[40:01.55]But also, luck.
[40:03.87]Like, right place, right time.
[40:06.47]And... Yeah, I... I got to click the one in the middle.
[40:18.31]It's 90% luck.
[40:21.01]You're a millionaire.
[40:21.91]Just say yes.
[40:28.82]If I have to choose, I like spring better than winter.
[40:32.22]No way, dude.
[40:36.34]Before I start proceeding with something, I should make sure it's safe.
[40:47.79]Safe how?
[40:48.91]Like safe physical danger or safe like out of my comfort zone?
[40:51.77]I'm gonna say no.
[40:56.28]In a battle, what counts in the end is mental power.
[41:03.36]Unless the person has a gun.
[41:07.35]When I'm ordered to do something I like, I'm confused.
[41:17.88]What does that mean?
[41:22.72]When I'm ordered to do something I like, I'm confused.
[41:28.31]I don't think so.
[41:31.09]I think it's like I'm surprised.
[41:32.93]Like, oh, this is cool.
[41:34.55]If someone does something displeasing, I should not behave the same way.
[41:37.83]Yeah, if somebody's doing something, it doesn't mean you do it.
[41:48.07]When I am absorbed in something, I don't notice what's going on around me.
[41:51.11]Yes.
[41:53.79]In order to truly succeed, sometimes I need to make a risky choice.
[41:56.87]Yes.
[41:58.03]Absolutely.
[41:59.81]But have backup plans.
[42:07.02]That's all.
[42:07.40]Thank you very much.
[42:10.38]Please wait here for a while.
[42:14.97]I can't fucking wait, dude.
[42:15.79]You guys have no idea how fun this game is.
[42:18.83]Hello Jex, thank you for waiting.
[42:21.18]I was explaining the type of trainer you are to the trainer assistant.
[42:26.94]Uh... I am a trainer assistant.
[42:29.80]Oh yeah, okay, I remember.
[42:31.68]Exam pass date.
[42:33.02]The exam score.
[42:34.08]A little bit hasty.
[42:38.62]Okay.
[42:41.14]This is the trainer that I have for help.
[42:44.88]She is the trainer assistant who is going to your place.
[42:48.92]She is still a bit childish, but she sure is a good girl.
[42:55.41]Here she is.
[42:57.63]Coltia!
[43:00.69]How do you do, Jex?
[43:02.21]I'm Coltia.
[43:03.73]Please call me Colt.
[43:06.54]Yep.
[43:07.86]You're gonna work with her for quite some time, so please try to get along with each other.
[43:15.49]Do your best to raise a monster well so that it can win the major four.
[43:21.73]Way better than Pokémon.
[43:24.11]I'm looking forward to your performance.
[43:28.25]That's my opinion, right?
[43:29.91]My opinion is that I think this is better than Pokémon.
[43:33.04]That's my opinion.
[43:34.42]You might have a different opinion.
[43:35.62]Your opinion could be different than mine, and that's okay.
[43:42.04]Yes, sir.
[43:43.75]Well, Jex, let's do our best.
[43:46.43]First, you should obtain a monster at the market in the town, or... At the shrine, by generating it from a disk stone or a slate.
[43:56.09]And then take it with to the ranch.
[43:59.48]So how this game worked back in the day is there was a certain code that was embedded onto every CD and DVD that you owned.
[44:08.31]And it would pull a random piece of data from that.
[44:10.63]For instance, I put Adam Sandler's Click in when we played this a few years ago.
[44:15.33]And you get a specific monster to that disc.
[44:19.45]So obviously now CDs don't exist anymore, so I don't know what the hell they're going to do.
[44:23.39]But I guess now there's like a gigantic database where you can look up your favorite songs and movies or something.
[44:28.91]I don't know.
[44:29.85]I wonder how it works.
[44:33.35]We'll find out.
[44:34.41]But it was really fun because I got like 40 just random CDs and DVDs.
[44:41.89]And we just generated monsters.
[44:43.67]And the monster will always be the same for that disc.
[44:46.41]It can be a million different combinations.
[44:47.89]Although it's probably like way less than that.
[44:49.57]But it's a lot.
[44:52.77]Thank you.
[44:58.64]Did you see that information there?
[45:01.12]I'm still a rookie here.
[45:03.04]And Jex, you too.
[45:04.22]Have just become a trainer, right?
[45:06.82]Is there anything you would like to ask about?
[45:11.95]I know everything there is to know.
[45:14.23]I've already played this game.
[45:19.09]Are you done?
[45:21.00]Yes.
[45:22.96]Then let's go find our monster.
[45:24.22]We're gonna get our default monster, we're gonna get our Squirtle, we're gonna get our Charizard, or... The one with the plant stone is back.
[45:31.40]So.
[45:32.12]Wait, should we go to the shrine?
[45:36.54]Excuse me.
[45:37.04]Is this your first time visiting the shrine?
[45:40.45]What's your name?
[45:42.24]My name is Colt.
[45:42.80]This is Jex, a trainer.
[45:47.07]I am... Chally, a priestess of the shrine.
[45:51.03]We generate monsters using disk stones... and slates, backup data of Monster Rancher.
[45:57.26]So this is like save game and stuff, right?
[46:00.96]Which do you... What do you want to generate?
[46:02.48]A disk... How does this work?
[46:03.96]Disk stone.
[46:07.51]Uh... I wonder how this works.
[46:11.89]The music is... I'm so excited.
[46:15.30]I am too.
[46:17.68]Here comes DMCA.
[46:18.52]I don't... No, hold on.
[46:19.72]Where is it?
[46:20.02]I don't think it actually plays the music.
[46:25.62]It definitely doesn't play the music.
[46:26.77]Oh shit, what am I doing?
[46:32.51]How can we get... Wait, what do I do?
[46:36.25]Oh, okay.
[46:36.45]So what should I look up?
[46:37.57]Oops.
[46:39.51]The title of the song?
[46:40.90]Or an artist?
[46:45.54]Cautions?
[46:46.12]Alright, how about just something simple?
[46:52.39]Okay, how about... Crazy frog?
[46:57.75]Does that exist?
[47:03.51]There's no search result.
[47:04.65]Please change the conditions.
[47:08.43]There is no crazy frog.
[47:11.61]Toxic.
[47:17.93]Uh, Toxic by 30 Forever... There, Toxic by Britney Spears.
[47:27.64]Okay, are we ready?
[47:29.18]What did we get from Toxic by Britney Spears?
[47:34.12]I regret to tell you that... This rare monster can be generated only by an authorized trainer.
[47:42.59]Please come again.
[47:44.21]Remember that for later.
[47:45.59]This is a rare monster.
[47:52.56]Okay, let's try again.
[47:56.43]Something else.
[47:59.93]Elvis?
[48:00.15]What do they have for Elvis?
[48:02.39]Okay, Elvis Costa.
[48:07.93]No, no.
[48:08.41]Where's Elvis Elvis?
[48:11.49]Where's Elvis Elvis?
[48:16.45]Elvis!
[48:17.09]Okay, there's Elvis Elvis.
[48:20.10]I thought a little less conversation, a little more action.
[48:24.13]I think that one.
[48:24.73]A little less conversation.
[48:28.31]Elvis versus JXL.
[48:30.07]Okay.
[48:33.20]Let's see what we got.
[48:34.94]Here is the big moment.
[48:35.84]Are you ready?
[48:36.22]Ready?
[48:50.26]It's a brown dinosaur.
[48:54.31]What is it?
[48:58.91]Strong looking monster.
[49:00.07]Why is it so tired?
[49:04.07]Looks dependable.
[49:07.09]Okay, do you want to take this monster to your ranch?
[49:11.70]Alright, this shit's really important.
[49:15.34]That's not bad.
[49:16.87]High skill.
[49:18.29]Intelligence is awful.
[49:19.15]Power is not that great.
[49:19.95]But life and skill are really high.
[49:23.94]I think we can have a bunch.
[49:25.86]I'm going to take it.
[49:26.36]Should I take it?
[49:31.38]It gives 100 gifted subs.
[49:36.71]Who gave 100 gifted subs?
[49:38.11]What?
[49:40.69]How did I miss that?
[49:44.28]Soveen, 4500 community subs.
[49:47.72]What are you doing?
[49:50.46]Thank you, Soveen.
[49:52.42]The 100 community subs.
[49:55.54]Finally noticed.
[49:57.72]Speed is horrible.
[49:59.32]From what I remember, intelligence and power are the important ones.
[50:03.56]Intelligence, power, and life.
[50:07.18]Which is the one that replenishes guts?
[50:09.04]Because guts is like mana.
[50:13.70]But that's an insane amount of money.
[50:16.42]That's never, never necessary.
[50:17.92]Never expected.
[50:19.42]It's crazy.
[50:19.96]Thanks for the insane amount of subs.
[50:23.22]Name this Alvin.
[50:25.37]We'll remember.
[50:26.23]Because they don't change.
[50:29.03]We'll remember.
[50:30.49]So I'm not going to take this one.
[50:32.57]Elvis, a little less conversation.
[50:34.55]A little more action.
[50:37.57]Alright, let's try it again.
[50:38.25]How about...
[50:44.92]Kevin McCloud?
[50:47.36]Definitely not here.
[50:50.84]How is it?
[50:51.16]Is it Mac?
[50:53.46]Like that?
[50:56.38]Damn it.
[51:01.52]Oh, Freddy Dredd.
[51:02.42]Let's see it.
[51:02.82]Could it be Freddy Dredd?
[51:07.91]Spelled it wrong?
[51:09.79]If there's a Freddy Dredd on here, I'm going to have to do it.
[51:13.74]Is it 2Ds?
[51:14.64]What is it?
[51:16.74]I'm spelling it wrong.
[51:17.36]Is it 2Ds or is it A?
[51:18.24]No, it's 2Ds, right?
[51:30.47]It's not like that.
[51:31.35]Or what if I do that?
[51:34.40]What about 100 Gex?
[51:41.02]Not here.
[51:42.42]I think it's based on from like 1999 or something.
[51:45.94]This is not like, I think this is actually pulled from like the CDs that were available.
[51:50.84]Weezer?
[51:51.30]Okay, Weezer.
[51:58.07]Which Weezer album?
[51:59.99]I've done, I don't know what any of these albums are.
[52:01.49]How about Christmas with Weezer?
[52:09.03]Sounds good to me.
[52:11.81]I regret to tell you, it's too rare.
[52:13.01]Alright, whatever.
[52:18.22]What's on the market?
[52:23.08]Radiohead?
[52:24.91]Yeah, you can buy monsters too.
[52:27.27]So monsters have two different types.
[52:29.52]There's the main type and the subtype.
[52:31.84]And pretty much all monsters can be combined.
[52:34.64]So if you have like a dino type and a bug type, they can be combined.
[52:41.69]Sometimes it can just be dino, dino, right?
[52:43.69]Which is just, just dino.
[52:46.61]Or you can combine monsters too.
[52:49.89]So I think everything in the market is just a straight, just straight up, like, dino.
[52:55.51]Or, like, Ivysaur or whatever, right?
[53:00.98]Okay, let me see.
[53:03.08]Oh, they buy monsters from you too.
[53:04.48]I forgot about that.
[53:08.76]Let me see what's in the market so we know what we're looking for.
[53:10.54]Let's see.
[53:12.92]What do you got?
[53:14.11]Please choose.
[53:15.99]So we have, this is a regular just dino.
[53:17.73]Okay.
[53:20.81]Choose a monster you like.
[53:21.57]Okay, Zoom, Suezo, or Emochi.
[53:30.72]What's the Dino's, uh, the Zoom?
[53:32.24]Alright, that's actually kind of, is that better than the one that we found?
[53:41.02]This one's actually a little better.
[53:45.48]It's way better.
[53:49.56]Type in the talking heads.
[53:52.45]Alright, let's go over these so people know what's going on.
[53:54.69]Life is just your health.
[53:56.09]Power is physical damage.
[53:57.55]Intelligence is magic, like tech damage.
[53:59.93]It's green.
[54:01.34]Skill, I don't remember.
[54:03.18]Speed, I don't remember.
[54:04.40]And defense is how, uh, you know, damage reduction.
[54:08.68]I forget what skill and speed actually do.
[54:10.22]Speed, I think, actually is your... That's regeneration?
[54:14.62]Skill is accuracy.
[54:15.53]Speed is turn order.
[54:16.53]There you go.
[54:18.29]Skill is hit chance.
[54:19.13]Speed is evade chance.
[54:20.05]Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[54:21.17]I don't want this one.
[54:24.29]Okay.
[54:24.41]Let's go back.
[54:27.05]I know the music is like a cartoon clown one.
[54:29.00]I know.
[54:33.22]The actual game of Monster Rancher.
[54:36.02]Just wait till we get to it.
[54:36.90]Holy shit.
[54:39.22]It's one of the best games ever made.
[54:42.06]I'm gonna drag this out for like the next two weeks.
[54:44.78]If you guys are ready.
[54:46.97]Alright, who should I do?
[54:52.41]Frank Sinatra?
[55:05.60]You're Frank Sinatra?
[55:16.15]Talking heads, okay.
[55:25.69]That's not here either.
[55:29.24]NSYNC?
[55:31.64]What?! !
[55:35.89]Nirvana.
[55:36.21]Okay, Nirvana.
[55:39.57]Which one?
[55:46.84]MTV Unplugged in New York?
[55:52.70]Which one should I do?
[55:57.51]MTV Unplugged in New York.
[55:59.91]I guess we're just gonna do this one.
[56:01.95]Here we go.
[56:11.88]The Unplugged album is actually good as hell.
[56:14.52]Alright.
[56:15.82]Alright.
[56:17.28]So this is a, like a triceratops thing.
[56:22.31]It's very small.
[56:25.71]Holy shit, that skill though.
[56:30.26]Life is bad, but that skill, that base skill is huge.
[56:44.48]Life is bad.
[56:45.62]I'm taking it.
[56:48.47]You have to give it a name.
[56:50.25]What will the name be?
[56:57.27]All fours, Barney.
[57:04.38]Barney, all fours.
[57:25.28]Gumbo?
[57:27.64]It's Barney.
[57:28.40]I'm crawling.
[57:32.44]Arnie Sanders?
[57:37.37]I like Barney.
[57:38.23]Alright, hold on.
[57:42.99]Barney.
[57:43.45]How about just Barney?
[57:50.43]I like Barney.
[57:52.25]How about Barney 4th?
[57:57.66]I like Bonnie 4's.
[58:06.26]What about Kurt?
[58:07.39]It could be Kurt.
[58:10.91]I like Bonnie though.
[58:20.33]This is just the first one.
[58:23.41]I like Bonnie 4's.
[58:24.28]It sounds kind of like Barney Rubble, but not at all.
[58:28.99]I like Bonnie for it.
[58:31.27]Alright, here we go.
[58:36.66]Alright.
[58:37.72]There's an auto-save feature that's amazing.
[58:42.27]So let's go back to the ranch.
[58:44.11]And let... I'm not... The controller's not really...
[58:49.39]This is where the game begins.
[58:50.95]You can get a ton more.
[58:51.84]Yeah, absolutely.
[58:53.26]The whole point of Monster Rancher is you train them and get their stats up.
[58:58.60]And before they die, you freeze them.
[59:02.24]And then you get another monster up.
[59:04.56]A shitload.
[59:06.12]And then you freeze that one and you combine them and you get something else.
[59:12.60]They can die.
[59:13.20]Yep.
[59:16.82]Which food do you want to give it this month?
[59:21.91]Okay, I have 5,000 gold.
[59:25.53]Though most monsters don't like such animal foods, a few do.
[59:29.27]Nutritious milk?
[59:30.96]I don't know what he likes.
[59:36.18]I remember the strat was, like, tablets are insane, right?
[59:40.44]I don't know what he likes.
[59:46.28]Do milk, he's a baby.
[59:49.96]Yeah, so the way this game works is there's a hidden stress and a hidden fatigue meter.
[59:58.41]The higher your stress and fatigue are, the more life is taken off of you at the end of your life.
[60:05.45]So if this base monster value lives for two years, if you keep your stress and fatigue high, it's just like chain-smoking cigarettes.
[60:15.46]You're just losing life at the end of your life.
[60:18.66]So you have to try to manage their hidden stress meter.
[60:22.96]Puppa Jelly reduces stress, from what I remember.
[60:27.00]Tablets just, they're expensive, but they just taste gross.
[60:31.52]They don't like it, but it makes them train better.
[60:33.07]I don't know if I go right into tablets.
[60:41.03]And they like certain foods, too.
[60:44.31]We'll do jelly.
[60:46.58]Jelly's usually a pretty good pick.
[60:49.20]Or milk.
[60:50.72]I'll do milk.
[60:51.14]Do you want to give milk?
[60:53.80]Yes.
[60:55.72]Here, eat.
[60:59.70]You like it?
[61:04.25]Yes, who is it?
[61:07.07]Oh, Colt, long time no see.
[61:09.25]Master Pabbs, nice to see you.
[61:11.61]Jex, this is Master Pabbs.
[61:14.13]Jex, I am Pabbs.
[61:15.25]Nice to see you.
[61:16.59]He was the greatest trainer ever.
[61:18.79]Stop it, Colt.
[61:20.71]Oh, they can run away too.
[61:22.17]So we have to be careful.
[61:24.43]Uh, Jex, keep up with the good work, Colt.
[61:27.45]I have to go now.
[61:27.97]I have an appointment.
[61:31.04]Master Pabs used to be the number one trainer among IMA.
[61:37.14]He's not running.
[61:37.82]He's fine.
[61:39.78]I know he doesn't look like that.
[61:42.40]Bonnie... I hate this.
[61:44.60]Bonnie 4 is very well.
[61:47.90]Alright, I'm curious.
[61:49.14]File.
[61:51.22]No, no, no.
[61:52.00]Where is it?
[61:54.14]Monster data.
[61:57.80]Okay, here we go.
[61:59.48]Alright, so...
[62:04.53]Why are you giving me so much money?
[62:07.23]75 more subs from Ariwani?
[62:08.99]Why are you giving me so much money?
[62:10.73]This is insane.
[62:12.79]Thank you.
[62:13.11]That's a lot of money.
[62:16.23]Alright, I need to see more.
[62:17.51]This is the win-loss record.
[62:22.06]Style even.
[62:22.94]Okay.
[62:23.78]Likes meat, does not like cup jelly.
[62:26.28]So if we feed this character cup jelly, it's going to be pissed.
[62:31.80]It's going to increase their stress and reduce their life.
[62:35.64]Not their HP, their actual how long they get to live.
[62:38.76]So we gotta be careful.
[62:41.12]That's a lot of money.
[62:43.53]Alright, uh, bad natured.
[62:45.77]Likes meat.
[62:47.41]Has these two moves, scratch and bite.
[62:49.71]Pretty good hit chance on, uh, yeah.
[62:52.43]This is like a power based, uh, text.
[62:55.52]Okay, so we need to do power.
[62:58.62]So, let's take a look at battle.
[63:02.16]Because if you see here, the game is based on weeks.
[63:06.50]So one loading screen is a week.
[63:10.55]So this week, there's nothing going on.
[63:12.17]Next week, nothing going on.
[63:13.23]So essentially, we have all of April and into May.
[63:16.69]And in May, there's going to be a tournament.
[63:19.45]With a thousand gold prize.
[63:20.79]Tutorial Andy?
[63:24.00]I have to be Tutorial Andy.
[63:25.04]A lot of people have never seen this before.
[63:28.46]Why would you compare this to Pokémon?
[63:34.06]You'll see.
[63:35.26]You'll see.
[63:37.58]Alright, so we got some time.
[63:38.52]Let's do some training.
[63:40.98]Training.
[63:41.39]So we want power.
[63:42.47]Okay, dominant power is up.
[63:46.15]Fatigue up.
[63:48.75]Study is intelligence.
[63:49.87]Run is life.
[63:52.41]So this one is power and life, but you lose speed.
[63:55.77]It's a bunch of fatigue.
[63:59.81]I think that's not a bad... His life is terrible.
[64:02.37]Probably life.
[64:05.40]These do a ton of stress on the monster as well.
[64:10.49]I think we're just going to go with... And also, when a monster is a baby, like this monster is, they get a lot less stat gains until they get to the prime of their life.
[64:23.68]Let's just do health.
[64:24.80]I feel like health is important.
[64:26.56]Here we go.
[64:30.68]Again.
[64:33.06]Come on!
[64:38.83]How'd you do?
[64:40.92]Yes!
[64:42.74]Plus 2 health.
[64:44.64]Still a baby.
[64:47.82]Eventually this will end up being like plus 10 health, plus 20 health.
[64:52.20]Avani 4 as well.
[64:55.58]Okay.
[64:57.06]Should we rest or should we do it again?
[65:02.64]I need to buy, like, mint leaves and nut seeds, whatever it is.
[65:08.29]Again.
[65:08.47]Alright, let's go again.
[65:10.27]Let's do it again.
[65:14.05]Although, should I really work that hard as a baby?
[65:22.10]Let's see.
[65:23.20]Alright, we got... I don't have to do any skill.
[65:28.80]Okay, looks alright.
[65:32.65]Work him.
[65:34.96]I don't wanna... He's a baby!
[65:37.04]This is a baby.
[65:39.12]Errantry is you send them on a mission and they can learn new skills.
[65:44.22]But we're not doing that right now.
[65:47.50]Let's just... Let's do... Let's... Okay, we're gonna train again.
[65:49.42]And then we're gonna rest.
[65:55.73]They can fail these too.
[65:57.41]Sometimes they... It's like a... Oh, no.
[65:59.61]Like I just said.
[66:04.72]Bonnie did not finish its drill.
[66:07.63]Scalded?
[66:08.01]No.
[66:09.17]It's a baby.
[66:12.09]It seems to be delighted.
[66:13.49]Alright, I need to go, uh... Seems well.
[66:20.90]Let's rest.
[66:23.18]I don't want to overdo it.
[66:24.96]Base stats are crazy on this guy.
[66:28.78]Okay, yeah, let's just relax.
[66:29.98]Don't have to do anything.
[66:30.75]Rest.
[66:30.93]Rest for the week.
[66:33.48]You want to let Bonnie rest.
[66:34.60]Yes.
[66:34.82]Perfect.
[66:42.25]Don't be such a softie.
[66:43.41]I'm not.
[66:44.09]It's a baby.
[66:48.49]Loyalty, 11.
[66:49.81]Style, soft.
[66:55.48]Alright, let's do some drills.
[66:58.84]You can do it.
[67:06.68]Oh, come on.
[67:07.54]Shit.
[67:08.37]Why?
[67:12.77]Bonnie did not finish their drill.
[67:14.97]Scold them.
[67:22.11]Seems disappointed.
[67:23.05]I can't be too... Which food do you want to give it this month?
[67:29.93]Alright.
[67:31.29]I think I'm going to go with the... He hates cup jelly.
[67:35.15]Alright, for those Monster Rancher enthusiasts here, even if he hates Cup Jelly, does the stress reduction on Cup Jelly negate the fact that he hates it?
[67:45.43]Because I know that Cup Jelly reduces stress.
[67:54.92]He wants meat.
[67:57.52]300?
[67:59.34]Don't overeat this, though.
[68:01.58]Not worth it?
[68:02.06]Alright, well, he wants meat.
[68:05.65]300 bucks We're really gonna gauge if this is gonna be long term enough based on the amount of How good they are in tournaments They're very well as well.
[68:17.56]Let's take a look at the battle calendar Alright We have it as a tournament coming up here So that means if I want to train it's either train once or
[68:32.81]Or skip the tournament, because he doesn't even have 100 health.
[68:35.62]What do you think?
[68:39.06]Should we just go for it?
[68:40.26]See how we can do in a tournament?
[68:41.54]Train, rest, battle.
[68:42.38]Let's go for it.
[68:48.94]This time, come on.
[68:50.03]Actually complete it this time.
[68:53.05]I fucking love this game.
[68:54.53]This is the only thing I'm going to stream for the next 10 years.
[69:00.72]I mean that in gerbil years, so like a week.
[69:04.72]There we go, nice.
[69:05.48]Good job.
[69:11.83]Seems well.
[69:14.29]Okay, 15 soft.
[69:17.18]Should we rest?
[69:19.54]Alright, we're gonna rest.
[69:21.08]And it's time for the first tournament for Bonnie!
[69:24.88]I'm so excited.
[69:25.70]Just wait till you see the battle.
[69:31.22]It's awesome.
[69:34.04]Alright.
[69:35.68]Are we ready?
[69:36.14]First fight.
[69:39.45]Grade E round robin for entrance.
[69:44.13]Bonnie has little loyalty now and may act confused.
[69:47.17]Do you still want to participate?
[69:48.99]Yes, I do.
[69:49.49]Pay attention to your monster's guts level during the battle.
[69:55.10]If the guts level is low, it can't use an attack.
[69:57.06]Guts essentially is mana.
[69:58.60]It regens.
[70:00.73]Don't get KO'd or you must make it injured.
[70:03.39]So just give up when it's in trouble.
[70:05.03]Forfeit button to give up.
[70:06.73]Yep.
[70:06.81]Let's go.
[70:11.14]The Blue Sky Cup.
[70:16.82]It's snowing.
[70:17.38]It's hard to believe it's spring here in the Papa's Arena.
[70:21.56]Under this condition, Blue Sky Cup is about to start.
[70:26.03]Jex.
[70:26.61]Let's go for it.
[70:29.09]What's the competition look like?
[70:33.48]Alright, we got Bonnie4, HarryKicks, OakleyMan, and Leon.
[70:38.78]Alright, this is kind of a mirror.
[70:41.46]I just dropped out information.
[70:48.48]What do you got?
[70:49.55]Our opponent, Leon, has high skill.
[70:52.87]Gotta KO it before it gets our monster.
[70:54.43]Can I see the data?
[70:58.33]Do I get to see the data?
[71:01.25]Do you want to give Bonnie advice during the battle?
[71:03.45]Yes.
[71:03.73]Because the CPU is an idiot.
[71:07.66]I wonder how you... Oh, I'm going to kick the shit out of you.
[71:11.94]Alright, so... There's like things on the sidebar.
[71:17.08]But I have a controller.
[71:17.86]I wonder how this works.
[71:21.24]Should I just move with the controller?
[71:25.00]How do I move?
[71:27.88]I don't know how to move.
[71:30.38]He's confused.
[71:33.93]Because it's based on where you are.
[71:37.88]What is going on?
[71:38.34]Alright, these controls, I got to figure this out.
[71:41.62]That was a big hit, though.
[71:44.60]Because I can't, how do I move left and right?
[71:46.61]I want to, like, is it L and R?
[71:47.49]Okay, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[71:48.39]Alright, it's L and R. I'm going to lose, maybe.
[71:54.86]Again, quick.
[71:57.05]There it is.
[71:57.39]Alright, so it's L. So all the moves are based on just position.
[72:02.77]I can't do scratch if I'm back in the second position.
[72:07.35]Like Darkest Dungeon.
[72:09.27]Except with one person.
[72:10.73]I have to be in that exact slot to do that move.
[72:14.23]Just so you know.
[72:18.05]Prediction result was yes.
[72:21.73]I kicked his ass.
[72:29.53]Alright, Bonnie won.
[72:33.06]Alright, versus Oakley Man.
[72:35.58]That's a beanbag Sonic.
[72:39.00]We can't get too excited.
[72:39.90]You're going to get wrecked by Oakley Man.
[72:44.18]Okay, Eric Hicks won.
[72:45.66]Alright, Bonnie versus Oakley Man.
[72:50.40]Let's go.
[72:57.92]Alright, you got a lot of health and you have a lot of power.
[73:02.32]So it's L and R to move back and forth.
[73:05.20]And then it's just A to do technique.
[73:07.27]So I just get in the right spot and do it.
[73:08.99]Okay.
[73:11.61]I'm gonna back up.
[73:16.51]Build it up.
[73:16.91]Alright, go for it.
[73:21.25]Go!
[73:24.45]Scratch again.
[73:26.20]20 damage.
[73:26.48]Back up.
[73:26.80]Back up.
[73:27.10]Back up.
[73:27.38]Back up.
[73:27.66]Back up.
[73:29.64]That's a lot.
[73:30.26]Holy shit.
[73:30.88]That hurt.
[73:31.20]Good dodge.
[73:35.57]Dodge again.
[73:41.65]Bring it together.
[73:42.25]I got a lot of guts.
[73:44.19]I got to get in close.
[73:46.77]Get in close.
[73:47.35]Come on.
[73:49.01]I have so much guts.
[73:49.97]Just keep using it.
[73:50.65]Dodge.
[73:52.01]Dodge.
[73:58.79]I have so much guts to keep using it.
[74:01.41]Come on, dude!
[74:01.95]Get it!
[74:06.42]Oh!
[74:08.80]Again, again, again, again, again!
[74:09.82]Uh-oh.
[74:26.89]Guts, so every move requires a certain amount of guts.
[74:29.75]You regenerate guts over time.
[74:33.61]Every move has a percentage to hit, which is increased, of course, by skill.
[74:37.92]I think we're still okay.
[74:44.56]Oakley man needs to lose.
[74:45.54]I don't think it's going to happen.
[74:49.86]Okay, Leon won.
[74:52.22]Everybody has won one game.
[74:53.06]We're going to have to do it again.
[74:57.71]Alright.
[75:01.32]Let's go.
[75:06.62]I'm at 30k.
[75:09.76]I should win this.
[75:10.28]My skill is way hard.
[75:14.65]Gotta get in close.
[75:15.57]We're doing Bite.
[75:18.33]What are you gonna... You have a move that's far away?
[75:20.17]Shit.
[75:21.31]Alright.
[75:21.69]Stay in close.
[75:22.27]Don't let him get away.
[75:25.98]Bite does the most damage.
[75:32.66]Back it up and do Scratch.
[75:36.42]Damn, that hurt.
[75:39.58]Come on, dude, really?
[75:48.36]Yeah, over there.
[75:52.19]What's your fucking dodge at?
[75:57.73]Scratch again.
[76:02.27]How the fuck am I going to lose?
[76:04.79]That 95 health sucks absolute asshole.
[76:10.09]Give me a crit.
[76:13.17]Come on, again, again, again, again!
[76:14.33]What's the percentage?
[76:15.09]Did I lose my percentage?
[76:25.90]Oh yeah!
[76:34.11]I got two wins.
[76:34.79]We're good.
[76:36.69]I gotta try to remember, okay.
[76:38.57]So, I have to select the move and then be in the range?
[76:42.03]Or do I just have to be in the range?
[76:44.43]I forget.
[76:44.79]Alright, Oakley man, lose.
[76:49.25]And I win.
[76:53.36]Come on, Leon.
[76:54.00]Kick his ass.
[76:54.52]Because I can beat Leon.
[77:00.64]It's dead.
[77:01.18]It's over.
[77:07.71]We have monsters whose scores are tied, so we will now hold a tie-breaking match to determine which I'm going to lose.
[77:13.84]Should I forfeit before I get him hurt?
[77:15.14]I don't know.
[77:23.72]I don't think I'm going to beat Oakley Man.
[77:30.45]Do it.
[77:30.89]Fight.
[77:31.59]I can't.
[77:31.93]I'm going to lose.
[77:32.43]He might die.
[77:33.49]They can die.
[77:34.37]If he gets knocked out, you can actually kill him.
[77:41.77]It's not worth it.
[77:42.23]Alright, I'm going to say... So, what's... Withdraw or drop out?
[77:50.33]Isn't it the same thing?
[77:56.44]I'm with... Yeah, I'm withdrawing.
[77:59.80]Withdraw.
[78:00.10]I don't want him to get hurt.
[78:09.57]Oakley man is the winner.
[78:13.48]I did put it for the first time ever.
[78:14.68]He's a baby.
[78:15.26]This is the result of the tournament.
[78:20.65]I got... I got in second place.
[78:22.39]I get 500 bucks.
[78:23.83]I get 600 bucks.
[78:26.97]Okay, it was $1,000 to win and get fame.
[78:30.92]And potentially die.
[78:32.66]Or $600 to come in second place and be alive.
[78:39.82]I gained one fame.
[78:42.38]Oh, no, never mind.
[78:43.72]Nobody cares.
[78:47.14]Jax, I think Bonnie4 has learned a lesson in this tournament.
[78:52.93]See, look.
[78:56.57]Always learning.
[78:58.93]Always learning.
[79:01.29]See, if I didn't withdraw, that doesn't happen.
[79:04.91]Good.
[79:06.86]Nice work.
[79:08.63]Boniforce could not be a champion.
[79:11.05]But I think it did a good job.
[79:12.49]Praise it.
[79:12.89]Yes, absolutely.
[79:13.65]It was the first competition.
[79:17.24]Keep it up.
[79:19.48]I'm going to Oakley Man's stream.
[79:23.54]Alright.
[79:24.38]It's time to rest.
[79:32.92]Well, guess what?
[79:33.62]Oakley Man stays in E rank their entire broadcast.
[79:37.18]So just be aware of that.
[79:40.93]Alright, food.
[79:42.05]I'm thinking we go all out here and we do tablets.
[79:47.41]Tablets reduce stress.
[79:48.71]Stress, whatever.
[79:49.63]And they make it so they're in a good position to train.
[79:52.89]What do you guys think?
[79:56.77]I think tablets.
[80:04.06]I'm going for it.
[80:09.24]I also need to go to the market and buy some mint leaves.
[80:12.14]Because that reduces stress too.
[80:13.56]Because otherwise, your monster dies in like a year.
[80:17.88]The first official tournament is scheduled at the end of the month.
[80:21.02]You have to prepare Barney right now.
[80:24.70]Who is it?
[80:26.60]Ah, you have mail.
[80:28.06]Thank you.
[80:29.54]Who is it from?
[80:31.20]Look at this.
[80:39.05]Errantry is usually expensive.
[80:42.69]Shall we send Bonnie for?
[80:45.61]Notice, this month the Errantry management office is promoting a price reduction for your monster's Errantry.
[80:50.93]We cordially encourage each friend to participate during this period.
[80:54.69]An Errantry.
[80:59.13]Okay.
[81:00.61]How much cheaper is it?
[81:05.73]We want to send our monster to an Errantry.
[81:09.07]Oh, you have to fill in the paper there for Errantry.
[81:12.85]I'm not doing it.
[81:13.89]Write down the monster name and the trainer's name.
[81:16.57]Yes.
[81:20.13]Okay.
[81:21.37]Yeah, you send them on a mission and they get stats and they find items and shit, but it's really taxing on them.
[81:26.45]It takes a ton of fatigue.
[81:33.14]Maybe I shouldn't do Errantry when the monster's this young.
[81:35.60]I don't think it's a good idea.
[81:41.14]Errantry term is a month.
[81:42.60]During that period, you're not allowed to contact with a monster.
[81:46.55]You choose a location from five different sites.
[81:48.37]It'll cost $2,000.
[81:49.67]Some locations are not for the low-ranked monsters.
[81:54.99]Also, a wild monster appears around here occasionally.
[81:58.67]Yeah, and they kick the shit out of you.
[81:59.75]I remember this.
[82:02.45]Yeah, it's the monster who attacks monsters during the errantry.
[82:04.97]If your monster wins, you'll get the prize money.
[82:07.87]Of course, there is a chance that your monster will get killed.
[82:13.11]Is that good?
[82:14.49]You could do it.
[82:15.43]And then I'd fucking die.
[82:20.41]Discount.
[82:20.81]It's a huge discount this month.
[82:22.23]I think I'm just gonna do it.
[82:26.41]Alright, what do you think?
[82:28.51]This is huge, huge skill in life.
[82:30.91]I think we need to do life, though.
[82:32.81]Power in life?
[82:35.79]Yeah.
[82:36.95]I need to hit way harder.
[82:41.27]Your stats suck.
[82:42.11]Don't do it yet.
[82:45.50]Is he too young?
[82:47.30]It's probably bad, but it's a thousand dollars off.
[82:53.24]I'm just like opening the door to like the backslider of the house.
[82:57.73]To like a fucking puppy.
[82:59.93]And going, yeah, go!
[83:00.87]Go for it!
[83:01.37]Find some items!
[83:02.53]That's probably a really bad idea.
[83:05.03]I don't want to do that.
[83:09.07]I'm not doing that.
[83:10.83]No, that's too dangerous.
[83:11.41]Too dangerous.
[83:13.40]Too dangerous.
[83:16.33]We'll have him, uh... I need to go to the store.
[83:28.50]I wanna buy some stuff.
[83:33.74]Uh, welcome to the market.
[83:36.46]Okay.
[83:37.32]I wanna get... I already have a monster.
[83:39.93]What if I get items?
[83:40.65]Lab?
[83:42.35]Lab?
[83:45.76]This must be your first visit!
[83:48.02]My name is... Dadge.
[83:49.90]I'm in charge here.
[83:50.62]If you want to combine or freeze, this is the place to do it.
[83:53.28]Okay.
[83:53.38]What do you like to do?
[83:58.44]Uh, so what happens is you can freeze a monster, it stays at the exact age, the exact... stats and everything before they die.
[84:04.56]And you put them into cryogenic freezing chambers.
[84:08.78]And then you combine their DNA.
[84:12.85]Okay, so it's not there.
[84:13.53]Where is it?
[84:14.41]Lab?
[84:14.93]Job?
[84:16.96]Job?
[84:17.26]You can come here whenever you need a job.
[84:24.64]Do the job.
[84:26.58]No.
[84:27.87]No.
[84:29.89]Where do I buy items?
[84:33.55]Is it not unlocked yet?
[84:41.01]The item store?
[84:41.57]Yeah, the market doesn't let me do it.
[84:44.23]Or is it on the farm?
[84:47.19]He's so tiny.
[84:49.19]Item.
[84:50.51]Oh, shop.
[84:50.89]Here we go.
[84:57.46]Okay.
[84:58.42]So we need to get nuts and mints.
[85:08.96]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[85:10.20]Let me buy, buy.
[85:11.02]Please, get out of my way.
[85:13.42]Get out of the way.
[85:16.53]Get out of the way.
[85:18.31]Get out of the way.
[85:20.18]Get out of the way.
[85:23.16]You can fit more text than this, by the way.
[85:26.14]Like, what are you going to do?
[85:28.10]Second line.
[85:28.60]Third line.
[85:29.28]There's four lines of text available.
[85:33.27]Alright.
[85:33.69]Monsters love to snack on this tasty fruit.
[85:35.85]Candy.
[85:38.95]Most of these reduce or add stress and fatigue.
[85:43.37]Mint leaf.
[85:44.10]How much are they?
[85:46.48]It relaxes your monster and relieves its stress.
[85:48.32]I need to buy a bunch of these.
[85:51.22]I'm going to buy five mint leaves.
[85:54.88]Sweet jelly, sour jelly, nuts oil.
[85:57.82]Okay.
[85:59.08]This helps with fatigue.
[85:59.97]I'm going to buy five of these.
[86:04.47]Alright, now I need to save some money.
[86:08.15]It's rumored that a monster will become popular if it eats this.
[86:14.22]Like a fame fruit.
[86:17.41]I'll get a few mangoes too.
[86:18.51]It's like a little treat.
[86:22.62]Okay.
[86:26.32]So I'm going to use mint leaf, right?
[86:28.80]I should probably use both of these.
[86:35.67]It just helps.
[86:39.13]Did you get high to do this?
[86:40.17]No.
[86:43.69]I'm going to do both.
[86:46.46]I think... I think I have this correct.
[86:50.69]Take it.
[86:52.77]This reduces your overall stress by a certain percentage.
[86:55.07]So you live longer.
[86:56.95]You're supposed to use one of these each month.
[87:01.81]That makes sense.
[87:13.26]Only one at a time?
[87:13.92]Okay.
[87:16.41]Alright, so we've given that.
[87:18.89]How you doing right now?
[87:21.61]Alright, get in there.
[87:23.07]Elf.
[87:24.63]Show us a run.
[87:29.49]What's this, like, ice cube thing?
[87:33.63]Good.
[87:35.69]Cheated?
[87:36.07]Wait, he cheated?
[87:39.20]Barney cheated on his drill.
[87:46.96]Sometimes you gotta know what it takes.
[87:48.54]That's my boy.
[87:52.54]That's my smart boy.
[87:59.30]He's very fond of me.
[88:05.13]Let's do it again.
[88:07.03]What's the next?
[88:07.71]I want to stuff.
[88:10.65]Fucking fist.
[88:13.48]Into that motherfucker's face, whatever his name is.
[88:15.67]That guy, the guy looked like a rock.
[88:18.13]What was the name?
[88:18.57]Oakley Man?
[88:20.69]I'm not doing the tournament, not yet.
[88:21.83]I need at least 100 health.
[88:26.67]No, it's not worth it.
[88:27.91]Too much.
[88:28.21]Do it again.
[88:38.22]Help me, I'm trapped.
[88:40.50]Cheating again.
[88:42.30]Yeah, that's my boy!
[88:46.74]Maybe I shouldn't praise the cheating because... He's gonna do it more?
[88:51.05]That's probably not a good idea.
[88:54.61]Hey, son, did you win?
[89:02.63]Alright, don't do that anymore.
[89:05.99]Seems sorry.
[89:06.61]Alright, Bonnie as well.
[89:15.55]If you're well, then why not just do it again?
[89:19.51]When's the next major tournament?
[89:24.05]Is the official cup.
[89:28.25]I don't know if they're ready for this.
[89:29.17]I don't think they're ready for this.
[89:38.16]I could try.
[89:42.14]Rest up for the week.
[89:43.48]We'll enter the official cup tomorrow.
[89:52.40]It's only cheating if you get caught.
[89:56.05]Yes, let's enter the tournament.
[90:00.07]Connie's in good shape.
[90:00.99]I'll bet you... I'll bet you'll rake the points.
[90:04.55]Very well, good.
[90:05.47]Let's do it.
[90:05.86]Official cup.
[90:08.06]This gets us out of E rank.
[90:11.42]If we can even do it, which I don't... Who knows if we can even do it.
[90:21.78]Alright, let's fucking go.
[90:28.14]Just give up if you need to?
[90:29.14]Yeah, I don't want to get anybody killed here.
[90:34.06]Grade E. Young monsters gather in the place with ambitions to be a tomorrow's star.
[90:41.58]It's the time to start the official tournament.
[90:46.03]It is THE time.
[90:50.14]Alright, official tournament.
[90:50.92]Let's go.
[90:51.24]This game looks great, by the way.
[90:53.52]Can I just say?
[90:57.90]Oakley Man's in this fucking competition.
[91:08.34]What if I just withdraw?
[91:09.40]Alright, let's go.
[91:10.42]Let's go.
[91:13.70]Alright, let's... Hopefully I don't get killed.
[91:15.26]His health is so bad.
[91:18.50]I need crits.
[91:19.14]A lot of them.
[91:21.60]Alright, let's go for it.
[91:22.50]Back it up.
[91:28.57]Again.
[91:38.09]God damn it.
[91:40.75]What is his speed at?
[91:41.67]55% chance to hit.
[91:49.43]Oh my god, what is your speed at?
[91:51.33]I just have to win with, uh, I don't have to, I don't have to KO him.
[92:01.71]Dodge.
[92:02.93]Nice, good job.
[92:05.96]Oh my god, do it again.
[92:06.86]Again, again, again, again.
[92:11.62]Again!
[92:13.92]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[92:15.54]Get out of his range.
[92:16.50]All the way back, all the way back.
[92:17.76]Just run it out, run the clock out.
[92:20.93]Oh, Oakley man, you just got fucking destroyed.
[92:22.52]I just beat him.
[92:25.62]Out of range.
[92:26.18]Get out.
[92:26.82]See you later.
[92:27.30]I win.
[92:29.10]Although I gotta beat everybody else.
[92:34.82]Nice.
[92:40.85]Alright, Oakley man, now you're on the ropes.
[92:43.15]Good luck.
[92:48.21]Although I have not seen these other people though.
[92:53.26]I want that thing.
[92:53.98]Whatever it is.
[92:54.42]It's like a weird dolphin.
[92:55.98]Okay.
[93:00.24]One and one here.
[93:02.04]We've seen these two.
[93:05.49]Alright.
[93:05.77]That was close.
[93:06.25]Alright.
[93:11.39]Bonnie versus Nats.
[93:14.21]Is it Bunny?
[93:18.39]I think the bunny's fast.
[93:20.13]Oh, you're dead in two hits.
[93:21.35]Goodbye.
[93:21.87]Why'd you even enter in the competition?
[93:23.52]What's the point?
[93:26.18]Why would you enter a monster with 57 health?
[93:28.48]I'm gonna kill you in two hits.
[93:29.90]And I'm gonna try to kill you.
[93:31.28]That was kind of fucked up.
[93:45.62]Yeah, alright.
[93:49.19]Oh, alright, so you want to fight.
[93:50.59]Alright, that's how it is.
[93:51.33]You want to fight.
[93:53.41]Now I am going to go for blood.
[94:05.66]Stay close.
[94:06.44]Stay in close.
[94:07.22]He has one fucking move and it's in the third slot.
[94:09.06]Just stay in close.
[94:10.82]Oh my god, he's going to beat me.
[94:14.40]Anger, he's pissed.
[94:19.90]Grit?
[94:20.62]What is that?
[94:20.98]He gets an extra health?
[94:25.00]Oh boy, this is bad.
[94:28.10]Get in close!
[94:35.03]He has one move.
[94:36.65]It was like fart and punch in the third slot.
[94:40.93]I wonder, what does anger do?
[94:42.15]I forget.
[94:50.34]Okay.
[94:50.62]2-0.
[94:53.82]It's really important that Juno Mule loses this fight.
[94:57.85]Alright.
[94:59.87]That's the one to beat.
[95:06.22]Oakley Man's going to beat Leon.
[95:08.30]Beat him last time.
[95:08.86]Holy shit.
[95:10.70]What happened?
[95:11.18]Leon got stronger.
[95:12.28]Leon is not... Oakley Man sucks ass.
[95:20.29]Alright.
[95:20.95]Interesting.
[95:22.15]I gotta go 3-0.
[95:30.46]I might actually lose this one.
[95:37.32]Hmm.
[95:41.10]I don't know.
[95:41.40]I'm concerned.
[95:48.97]Staying close.
[95:54.15]Scratch.
[95:54.81]Get in close again.
[95:55.94]Bite.
[95:57.36]Bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite.
[96:02.66]Dodge.
[96:06.70]I'm... Let me do my bite.
[96:07.96]Come on.
[96:09.57]He keeps pushing me.
[96:10.25]He keeps getting me back.
[96:12.21]Bite.
[96:12.67]Don't get confused by bite.
[96:13.87]You just bite him with your mouth.
[96:16.43]He doesn't want me to do anything this close.
[96:17.85]There you go.
[96:19.51]Again.
[96:19.69]Do it again.
[96:22.32]Do it again.
[96:22.56]I have plenty of guts.
[96:24.92]More, again.
[96:33.42]Don't get confused, come on.
[96:34.42]57% chance, give me a fucking break.
[96:39.44]I just gotta win by percentages here.
[96:44.58]Oh my god, I think I just lost.
[96:45.80]Did I lose?
[96:48.27]Oh, nice.
[96:49.95]That was close.
[96:55.53]Bonnie's pretty good.
[96:56.09]This is the only second tournament ever.
[97:00.29]Greeno.
[97:03.88]Imagine the doubters.
[97:05.88]Yeah, what the fuck is going on here?
[97:10.70]We got way too many doubters in the chat right now.
[97:13.95]Too many of you.
[97:18.19]Alright.
[97:19.75]This is important.
[97:23.75]I'm very shocked by this.
[97:25.92]In one month, Leon is now unbeatable.
[97:31.74]Alright.
[97:33.82]This fight doesn't matter.
[97:34.64]We're not going to see either one of these again anyways.
[97:38.62]This is like championship fight coming up here.
[97:42.51]What?
[97:42.77]How did you get so much?
[97:43.51]How did you get so good?
[97:54.52]Oh, it's power.
[97:57.46]Let's do it.
[98:06.22]Let's go.
[98:08.62]I'm curious what the stat change was.
[98:10.22]It seems like it's kind of a huge change.
[98:12.52]No, it's not.
[98:15.16]How did he beat everybody?
[98:19.20]I have better stats than him, and I had more trouble than he did.
[98:24.86]Okay, what this fight has to be is just get in close and spam bite.
[98:32.50]Get in close.
[98:33.02]Morph, go, go, go, go, go.
[98:41.56]He's so much bigger than me.
[98:42.70]Look at how much bigger he is than me.
[98:44.93]Morph, don't let him fight.
[98:49.65]Get out of here.
[98:50.41]Tournament over.
[98:51.15]I won.
[98:51.95]E rank.
[98:52.59]Let's go.
[98:56.61]I love this game.
[98:57.47]It's so fun.
[99:00.95]It is now impossible for me to lose the tournament.
[99:10.07]I think I should get a buy, right?
[99:15.83]Who have I not fought?
[99:16.53]There's one person I haven't fought.
[99:22.98]Who is it?
[99:26.57]Oh, it's you.
[99:29.05]I could lose this.
[99:29.61]Should I just forfeit?
[99:31.22]Who cares?
[99:31.64]I just win.
[99:36.74]I'm 4-0.
[99:41.22]Would that be shitty?
[99:42.10]If I just looked over there and I was like, no, I'm good.
[99:45.13]I just win.
[99:45.53]Good for the money.
[99:49.03]Alright.
[100:00.65]I don't know the strategy.
[100:01.43]The strategy here might be to run away.
[100:04.71]Those stats are insane.
[100:06.65]What the fuck?
[100:10.60]How do I do dispel on a controller?
[100:12.42]I wonder.
[100:19.48]I wonder.
[100:21.16]The spell is when you're close, you can press a certain button combination and it goes boom and it knocks you guys back all the way.
[100:26.46]It's L and R at the same time.
[100:30.52]No help.
[100:30.92]What do you mean don't tell him?
[100:32.62]I'm trying to win a tournament.
[100:33.79]Alright, let's go.
[100:38.27]He has nothing of long range.
[100:40.11]I could just... I got a strategy here.
[100:42.17]See if it works.
[100:42.57]Oh, he's getting confused.
[100:57.86]Get in close.
[100:59.23]Dodge it.
[101:05.71]What the fuck?
[101:06.49]Do a move!
[101:07.37]Do a move already!
[101:09.03]Do your bite!
[101:10.07]He's literally right in front of you!
[101:12.51]Get angry!
[101:14.61]Get angry!
[101:16.77]Bite him!
[101:18.07]Bite his throat!
[101:26.34]I was spamming!
[101:33.59]I still win the tournament.
[101:39.41]Yeah, I'm four and one.
[101:41.17]I won the tournament.
[101:41.97]I win.
[101:45.82]It doesn't matter.
[101:46.30]Oh, wait.
[101:46.70]Okay, if Leon wins this.
[101:52.90]Oh, you lost to the fucking 50 health rabbit.
[101:56.93]Oh, you deserve to not be in the top two.
[102:02.30]You lost to the rabbit.
[102:03.50]The rabbit sucks.
[102:05.38]Must have been tired.
[102:07.42]Yeah, now I actually win.
[102:11.58]Oh, wait.
[102:12.26]No, Oakley man.
[102:12.98]No, I'm good.
[102:13.76]Tournament's over.
[102:14.30]I won.
[102:18.18]Bonnie Fours is the winner.
[102:22.14]Nice job.
[102:23.62]Do a dance.
[102:27.68]That's a screenshot.
[102:34.23]This is the result of this tournament.
[102:37.65]Prize.
[102:38.07]500.
[102:38.53]700 bucks.
[102:39.49]Come on.
[102:43.20]Some more fans.
[102:47.16]Eight people thought that was cool.
[102:52.58]I got eight new fans.
[102:55.17]Hey, Jex.
[102:56.27]I think Bonnie's has learned a lesson in the tournament.
[103:00.01]It's so smart.
[103:02.57]See, look.
[103:06.87]Health just leveled up.
[103:11.88]Very good.
[103:13.16]Excellent job.
[103:18.06]Praise.
[103:19.76]Very delighted.
[103:20.62]Nice work.
[103:25.85]Alright, what food for this month?
[103:30.43]This is important.
[103:31.11]Should we give him meat because he loves it?
[103:33.41]Or should we just keep going with the tablets?
[103:34.61]Tablets.
[103:41.47]I think it's... The play here is probably tablets.
[103:45.37]But... They love meat.
[103:48.51]So, they just did a good tournament.
[103:49.85]They just won.
[103:51.05]Let's reward with the thing they like the most.
[103:55.46]Have some meat.
[104:04.46]Yes, who is it?
[104:07.23]Is this Jex's residence?
[104:09.41]Please sign here.
[104:10.35]Okay.
[104:12.11]Thank you.
[104:13.69]Good.
[104:14.51]Have a nice day.
[104:15.29]That's kind of like passive-aggressive.
[104:19.46]It's from the IMA.
[104:25.68]International Monsters Association card.
[104:28.36]Based on your performance, we will grant you the rank mentioned.
[104:31.17]First rank.
[104:34.71]Oh, maybe I can now go open up the new capsule.
[104:38.82]You know what I'm talking about?
[104:39.68]I think so.
[104:42.08]Pretty sure I know what you're talking about, but just go ahead and explain it again.
[104:45.20]Trainer ranking is the official document of all trainers by rank.
[104:51.79]From beginner to master.
[104:52.63]It's every trainer's dream to reach master ranking.
[104:56.03]We're at the first level, so we have nine ranks to pass.
[104:58.81]Let's make it.
[105:01.44]I'm excited.
[105:04.04]You hear about the meat?
[105:06.93]Master Pavs, why are you excited?
[105:09.83]It's not good for your health.
[105:12.85]Don't be silly.
[105:14.05]A battle between IMA and FIMBA is finally about to begin.
[105:18.89]How can I not be excited about this?
[105:21.63]Really?
[105:22.65]FIMBA is the neighboring continent's monster association, isn't it?
[105:27.69]Yes, it's finally confirmed.
[105:30.53]Every four years, we will select representatives from five different grades.
[105:35.13]It's five on five battles.
[105:39.44]Representative, representative.
[105:41.80]I guess we cannot be the one.
[105:43.12]No, if you win at an elimination tournament held at the end of this month, you'll be the one.
[105:48.98]Why don't you enter the tournament?
[105:53.10]Okay, let's do it.
[105:55.69]Let's represent this association.
[106:03.48]It's great to be a representative.
[106:05.40]We got to be one.
[106:09.31]Bonnie depends on us too much.
[106:10.83]I guess we spoiled it.
[106:14.03]Seems well.
[106:16.17]Uh-oh.
[106:19.53]What?
[106:19.91]He's... They've been doing so good, though.
[106:23.07]It's not... No, alright.
[106:28.40]Let's do some training.
[106:29.14]When's the next thing?
[106:33.39]Alright, so we unlocked C rank battles.
[106:36.01]No way am I going to be able to do one.
[106:41.61]Elimination grade D. What's the one they were talking about?
[106:44.42]Oh, this is the official D cup.
[106:51.00]Okay.
[106:52.96]I'm not doing C. I'll get my ass kicked.
[106:58.93]I don't think I can do it.
[106:59.89]I got to train him a little more.
[107:03.78]Alright, let's do... How about one of the... How old is he right now?
[107:07.66]How old are you?
[107:15.57]Three months?
[107:17.79]What's the age that they kind of get older?
[107:21.07]Six months?
[107:24.85]Because eventually they get to a point where the training is way more efficient.
[107:30.19]One year?
[107:33.50]Okay, so we got a little bit more time.
[107:39.97]Uh, we'll do some drills.
[107:44.35]Let's do... Power?
[107:48.03]Let's do power.
[107:51.67]I'm gonna feed him some mint.
[107:55.77]Good job.
[107:58.33]That was a huge success, wasn't it?
[107:59.53]Oh.
[108:02.45]Because huge success, I think, is way more increase.
[108:05.61]Alright, Bonnie's tired.
[108:13.66]Let's do... Let's give you some mint leaf and some nut oil.
[108:19.44]If someone was going to do mild voodoo on you, would you want to know or would you rather continue to be oblivious to it?
[108:36.14]Uh... Can you, like, leave me alone?
[108:41.49]Can you just, like, leave me alone?
[108:42.37]Like, uh... You know what I mean?
[108:48.09]Like, why... Why can't you just leave me alone?
[108:50.09]Alright, mint leaf.
[108:54.07]Let's go.
[109:01.00]That's not an option.
[109:04.85]Alright, can you do the kind of voodoo that makes me get like a 10 million dollar lottery ticket?
[109:11.77]Are you going to do bad?
[109:13.01]Are you going to curse me and shit?
[109:15.05]Do you feel an itch on your forearm?
[109:24.34]Right here.
[109:25.60]Right there.
[109:29.36]That was weird.
[109:33.71]Alright, let's go.
[109:35.83]Uh, training.
[109:36.29]Are you still tired?
[109:37.63]Let's rest.
[109:45.06]What if we do healing spells?
[109:46.12]Yeah, do healing shit.
[109:50.92]I want you to heal and give me good luck and good tidings and shit.
[109:55.65]Don't, like, make me itchy.
[109:57.07]That sucks.
[109:58.57]Don't do that.
[109:59.11]Why would you do that?
[110:01.03]What did I ever do to you?
[110:05.22]I'm gonna start wearing, like, garlic on my neck.
[110:14.30]Uh, power again.
[110:19.80]Let's get a huge success here.
[110:22.20]Wait, Bonnie says, I want to play with you next week.
[110:29.45]Do you grant its request?
[110:31.79]Do you play with him?
[110:36.83]But we're spoiling.
[110:38.09]We're spoiling the shit out of them.
[110:41.39]Yes, of course.
[110:42.19]Anything for my little baby.
[110:45.82]Yes, we can play next week.
[110:52.90]Ooh, nice jump.
[110:58.85]150 power.
[110:59.41]I'd be happy with more than like 70.
[111:04.01]Jax, didn't you make a promise that you'd play with Bonnie?
[111:07.71]Are you gonna play?
[111:09.25]Yes.
[111:10.63]Good.
[111:11.29]Bonnie's gonna be happy.
[111:16.32]Aren't you happy with the nice weather, Bonnie?
[111:19.72]Today, Jax will play with you, as promised.
[111:24.16]Okay, let's play.
[111:25.42]I need some lip balm.
[111:26.22]There it is.
[111:28.58]A mud ball fight.
[111:30.33]Tap the screen to find the monster on the field.
[111:36.44]Mobile port.
[111:40.16]Mobile port.
[111:42.02]Sorry.
[111:48.05]Tap the screen.
[111:53.77]The arrow on the lower left of the screen will show you which direction your monster is.
[112:00.08]You can move sideways while still facing forward by using the moving buttons, okay.
[112:03.74]When you see your monster, press the OK button to change to the aiming mode.
[112:11.33]Now touch to set your sights on the monster.
[112:14.89]This is a pretty good mobile port, okay.
[112:17.17]In fact... Hold on a second.
[112:21.36]Is this going on iPad?
[112:24.52]Does that mean this is gonna go on iPad?
[112:27.38]Is it on iPad?
[112:32.49]That does not upset me.
[112:36.93]It's on the Switch.
[112:37.65]That's not iPad, though.
[112:38.75]iPad's very different.
[112:40.21]I don't mind if I drop the iPad in the toilet.
[112:43.03]Or in the bathtub.
[112:46.54]It's on iPad right now.
[112:47.40]No, it's not.
[112:52.34]Who uses an iPad?
[112:53.50]Me.
[112:54.64]Alright, so we gotta aim...
[112:57.96]And fire?
[112:59.24]Throw a ball?
[113:00.50]Be careful because you cannot move in the aiming mode.
[113:04.18]I'm going to lose this, so we'll just figure out how it works.
[113:09.01]The number that appears in the upper left is Jex's points.
[113:11.45]Do your best to try and beat Bonnie.
[113:14.09]Okay.
[113:16.21]Let's go.
[113:16.45]Ready?
[113:18.66]Ready?
[113:29.41]What the fuck was that?
[113:36.68]How am I supposed to do this?
[113:39.16]What happened to him?
[113:39.78]Why'd he just fall?
[113:40.61]What's wrong with him?
[113:47.43]Oh, it's tied.
[114:02.36]Stop!
[114:05.87]Why do you have so many more balls than I do?
[114:07.49]This is unfair!
[114:08.43]Oh, I beat him!
[114:16.43]Hey, good game, Barney!
[114:25.54]I didn't lose to a baby, I won.
[114:32.98]Did I just, like, Billy Madison play dodgeball with a three-year-old?
[114:35.43]A four-year-old?
[114:40.67]I shouldn't be happy about that.
[114:42.05]I should be annoyed.
[114:43.15]Alright, food.
[114:45.21]Let's go with tablets.
[114:52.75]I want you to get big and strong, and I want you to have lots of power.
[114:56.73]Be careful you don't run out of money.
[115:04.00]I'm not even... I just... Spoiled.
[115:06.40]Alright.
[115:10.36]When's the next battle?
[115:13.19]There's no way I'm going to do this.
[115:14.89]Not a chance.
[115:15.37]I don't think I'm going to do this one either.
[115:21.91]I'll do... We'll do the official D. I want more training.
[115:31.70]I'm going to go for it.
[115:38.24]Huge success.
[115:48.95]Leveled up my power.
[115:50.07]Over 150.
[115:50.51]Do some defense.
[115:56.71]I could go see if I can unlock the other monsters.
[116:04.33]Okay.
[116:14.10]Uh, we need to freeze.
[116:14.86]Freeze this guy.
[116:18.92]I don't think freezing hurts him or does anything bad.
[116:23.86]Yeah, freezing I think just locks him.
[116:26.32]I don't think this hurts him at all.
[116:28.98]Somebody tell me if this adds to stress or something.
[116:33.78]I don't think it does.
[116:34.56]I think you just kind of freeze for a second.
[116:35.90]Because you can just unfreeze.
[116:43.68]Yeah, just freezes them at their current exact moment.
[116:46.02]Okay.
[116:50.61]See you later.
[116:51.03]That was kind of sad, but it's okay.
[116:58.01]Let's see if I can get Toxic.
[117:03.09]Okay, here we go.
[117:08.04]Toxic.
[117:10.88]By Britney Spears.
[117:13.68]Do I have enough ranking?
[117:14.94]I don't.
[117:18.39]I am an authorized trainer.
[117:19.83]Don't you see my license?
[117:20.75]What are you talking about?
[117:28.30]Give me something else.
[117:31.02]Hatsune Miku?
[117:31.80]Okay.
[117:36.06]Miku.
[117:39.58]There is no Miku.
[117:41.62]I guess I'm gonna go with Bird by Mikuni Shimokawa?
[117:49.53]What?
[117:49.75]It's rare!
[117:50.75]Remember that.
[117:51.33]Write that down.
[118:03.00]Uh... Dino Crisis?
[118:14.78]A Dino Crisis of... What about Dino?
[118:20.80]Dino... Dinosaurus.
[118:24.80]Dinosaurus.
[118:27.76]Viva La Vida.
[118:29.53]Dino Crisis by Capcom.
[118:49.92]It's a bunny.
[118:55.30]Cute.
[118:56.90]Yes, it's a very cute monster.
[119:01.58]Do you take- I'm not taking this.
[119:02.95]No, this monster sucks ass.
[119:04.53]Look at this.
[119:07.11]No.
[119:09.19]No.
[119:12.13]How about Dino Crisis 2?
[119:20.44]Dino Crisis 2.
[119:21.12]What's with all this rare shit?
[119:24.82]Come on.
[119:25.80]I have to win another couple tournaments.
[119:37.06]Weird Al.
[119:42.50]Nothing for Weird Al.
[119:44.70]Kanye.
[119:48.26]No.
[119:50.64]Gorillas.
[119:55.46]Aw, Demon Days.
[119:56.16]Let's go.
[119:59.60]What'd we get from Demon Days?
[120:00.44]Alright.
[120:15.76]What is that?
[120:16.14]Cute.
[120:18.24]Cute.
[120:19.61]Yes, it's a very cute monster.
[120:21.11]Holy smokes, that's 200 intelligence.
[120:28.13]That's almost 200 base intelligence.
[120:30.39]Those are going to hit so fucking hard.
[120:35.40]That is the keeper.
[120:41.14]Alright, name.
[120:48.63]Noodle?
[120:51.64]Noodle.
[121:00.63]It was L. No, that's nudie.
[121:06.55]L is right here.
[121:07.31]Nudie.
[121:07.79]I don't want it to be nudie.
[121:10.63]Noodle.
[121:14.13]Not nudie.
[121:14.82]Alright, let's do it.
[121:20.72]What do you get for moves?
[121:23.97]Dude, we could combine Noodle and Barney.
[121:27.93]You know what I'm saying?
[121:31.08]I wonder what we'd get.
[121:38.20]Barney Noodle.
[121:42.60]Alright, what do you got?
[121:45.04]So you have... Monster data, let's see.
[121:53.72]Alright, E. Noodle.
[121:57.00]Level 4 intelligence already.
[121:57.94]What do we got for moves?
[122:01.88]Nature.
[122:02.46]Best nature.
[122:04.31]Likes nuts oil and doesn't like tablets.
[122:09.05]Okay, you got a few moves here.
[122:12.31]This is bolt.
[122:13.23]Holy shit.
[122:13.87]This could be insane.
[122:17.02]This thing is guaranteed to hit.
[122:19.80]But it kind of sucks.
[122:21.30]Damage wise.
[122:23.52]All these are such high hit percentage, but not very powerful.
[122:27.53]I wonder how powerful it is.
[122:33.51]Why would you use kick instead of pat?
[122:36.95]The only difference is, I mean, well, I guess it's a little bit less guts cost, but who cares?
[122:40.36]Alright, well, we're going to give her a item.
[122:49.24]We're going to give nuts oil.
[122:59.67]That should help now.
[123:00.53]Let's do some training.
[123:03.54]Just intelligence.
[123:04.12]Let's get it over 200.
[123:05.84]Study.
[123:14.46]Are you learning?
[123:14.98]I don't... Okay, I guess they learned.
[123:19.57]That's a level up.
[123:20.69]Level 5 and level 6 intelligence?
[123:22.21]Okay.
[123:28.67]Okay.
[123:30.46]Do it again.
[123:30.78]But this time I want health.
[123:33.22]Her health is really low.
[123:38.28]No cheating.
[123:45.42]Good work.
[123:49.74]Why are you black and white?
[123:51.72]Wait, I am?
[123:54.23]Does the webcam look like washed out?
[123:58.99]Is it?
[124:01.16]Oh my god, it kinda is.
[124:02.20]It does feel like an old movie.
[124:05.34]Oh shit, hold on, let me fix this.
[124:10.25]It is really washed out.
[124:22.19]Is that better?
[124:22.61]Can you see me?
[124:29.31]Good, his red face is back.
[124:36.55]Need more red face.
[124:37.99]Alright, the life is bad.
[124:40.17]We gotta keep doing life.
[124:45.65]Still doing alright.
[124:46.37]Do it again.
[124:49.44]Is there a light?
[124:50.26]You don't want to do... Because this is considered to be heavy work.
[124:55.26]And when they're a baby, heavy work, you don't really get that big of an increase.
[124:59.96]So it's kind of stupid to do heavy training.
[125:03.00]Because you're just really taking time off of their life for no reason.
[125:07.45]Because they don't get that high of a gain when they're a baby.
[125:12.69]We'll do life again.
[125:15.13]I think that she's going to wipe the floor with the first tournament.
[125:33.10]You need a haircut?
[125:33.92]Yeah, I know.
[125:34.32]Alright, what did you like?
[125:37.65]You don't like tablets.
[125:40.19]I think Cup Jelly is the... Yeah, let's get Cup Jelly.
[125:45.81]She doesn't like tablets.
[125:47.44]Cup jelly is the best thing to do because it's the only thing that just reduces stress right off the bat no matter what.
[125:55.16]Look at this.
[125:55.58]A diamond mark?
[125:59.64]If we collect five of these, we'll get a fun can.
[126:04.13]Really?
[126:06.23]I always wanted this as a kid.
[126:07.59]Is this like Pepsi points?
[126:09.21]Alright, official tournament end of the month.
[126:18.36]When?
[126:20.04]It is the official tournament, E rank.
[126:23.78]She's gonna destroy everybody.
[126:25.75]Not concerned at all.
[126:33.87]I need life.
[126:39.74]So, what, um... It's alright.
[126:42.38]Don't worry about it.
[126:42.84]It is huge success, right?
[126:48.12]Is that just a flat percentage?
[126:54.99]Oh, it's fine.
[126:58.27]We'll say great.
[126:59.27]Okay.
[127:05.11]Rest.
[127:05.79]This is just like Nintendogs.
[127:19.55]Alright, we got... I don't think I'm even gonna... I think I'm just gonna rest.
[127:24.75]Yeah.
[127:25.29]Double rest.
[127:32.44]Tournament.
[127:33.52]Let's go.
[127:33.76]Official tournaments happening this week.
[127:42.78]Seems to be in good shape.
[127:46.18]Alright.
[127:48.28]Let's go for it.
[127:54.08]Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[127:54.68]It's just 200 intelligence.
[128:09.01]Alright.
[128:11.11]It's the same group of clowns that we have absolutely destroyed before, so I'm not scared at all.
[128:20.46]This is like a person running into a Pokémon field and kicking the shit out of Pikachu.
[128:25.70]I don't think a person would really do that.
[128:26.78]I think Pikachu would kill you as a person.
[128:30.76]Oh wait, we got a new person here.
[128:32.60]Alright, so the goal here is we're gonna stay back in the third slot.
[128:41.71]And we're just gonna zap, zap, zap, zap over and over again.
[128:44.19]Here we go.
[128:48.91]See how it works.
[128:52.23]Confused.
[128:52.67]That's not good.
[128:54.77]Back it up.
[129:00.12]That's a cool move, but I wish it would work.
[129:02.96]Oh my god, she gets confused.
[129:08.80]Bolt!
[129:10.02]Move forward!
[129:13.34]Oh my god, really?
[129:18.97]That sucks, actually.
[129:23.52]Oh shit, she's gonna lose.
[129:29.49]That should be doing way more.
[129:30.77]I have no guts.
[129:32.59]Stay back.
[129:36.51]Oh my god.
[129:37.69]Please don't die.
[129:49.04]She was not ready.
[129:52.42]Glass cannon?
[129:55.03]Glass Cup.
[129:57.73]Didn't do anything.
[129:58.75]Her move was doing 10 damage.
[130:03.82]I think with proper training, it should be okay.
[130:12.44]That's a lot of it.
[130:13.16]There's definitely a move you can learn that's a higher damage intelligence move.
[130:23.44]This game is rad.
[130:24.40]Yeah, it is.
[130:25.82]And we haven't even scratched the surface.
[130:27.74]There's so many different monster combinations.
[130:34.67]It's just a fun game, too.
[130:40.27]I think, I believe, okay, we should destroy Oakley Man because of one reason.
[130:46.46]Defense is for power attacks only.
[130:49.28]Intelligence is also defense against intelligence attacks.
[130:55.05]If I don't beat Oakley Man here, this is a big problem.
[131:02.03]Let's go.
[131:08.21]Don't be... you... What's confusing?
[131:11.17]Shoot him.
[131:13.79]Alright.
[131:14.35]Alright.
[131:14.87]That looks good to me.
[131:15.53]Back it up.
[131:27.09]Ease?
[131:27.37]I don't know what that is.
[131:30.90]Ease.
[131:33.54]Stay back.
[131:33.94]Get some guts.
[131:43.79]Don't ever do that move again.
[131:45.07]Don't ever do that again.
[131:48.29]Holy shit, you're gonna kill me in two hits.
[131:49.83]Back it up.
[131:51.25]Back up!
[131:51.93]Back up!
[131:54.60]Oh my god.
[131:55.32]Back the fuck up!
[131:57.42]Back!
[131:59.70]Get over there and fucking do it!
[132:05.99]I need the combo to push people.
[132:11.24]I don't know what the gamepad combination is to do the push.
[132:15.98]I need to learn that.
[132:16.72]It's one of the most important things in the whole game.
[132:34.50]He lost to a puddle of oatmeal.
[132:35.62]He has like 150 damage.
[132:41.45]I gotta get in the menu and I gotta look at the controls.
[132:47.31]What is this?
[132:48.11]Battle keys?
[132:49.05]Oh, here we go.
[132:49.55]Dispel.
[132:54.30]I don't know what I'm even looking at here.
[132:55.52]Alright, Dispel is... Wait, this... This is an original song.
[133:14.67]Original?
[133:17.39]It's X or A, depending.
[133:18.91]It's probably X. I'll try that.
[133:29.07]Well, I don't think she's... I can't win, no.
[133:33.53]I'll try X. Oh, right, it's gonna be the clown music.
[133:39.26]Maybe I should put it on remaster.
[133:40.52]The sound's gonna be worse.
[133:46.92]Okay.
[133:48.36]This shouldn't be too bad.
[133:49.74]It's going to be horrible.
[133:50.42]I'm going to lose.
[133:51.04]Guaranteed.
[133:59.72]Left and right.
[134:00.46]This is like putting your hands on an iPad.
[134:08.18]So I... I'll try X. I'm going to lose.
[134:11.78]There's no way I win this.
[134:14.22]Let's try the move though.
[134:17.09]Try X. Is it X?
[134:19.21]It's not X. Is it B?
[134:23.06]Oh, it's B. It's B. It's B. Alright.
[134:24.50]No, it's A. Okay, good.
[134:28.20]I get it now.
[134:33.96]Stay back.
[134:37.54]Hold back.
[134:38.88]It's like catching a fish.
[134:49.99]Again.
[134:51.75]Again, again, again, again, again.
[134:54.92]Again.
[134:58.18]How much dust does it take?
[134:58.96]I actually might win this.
[135:06.55]Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push.
[135:11.27]Don't hurt me.
[135:29.93]I think we put this lady in the freezer.
[135:44.12]I gotta withdraw.
[135:45.38]I gotta pull out.
[135:46.00]I gotta.
[135:46.28]I have to withdraw.
[135:52.56]I can't.
[135:52.84]I haven't won.
[135:53.60]No.
[135:53.72]Get out.
[135:54.06]Drop out.
[135:55.74]Drop out.
[135:57.92]Drop out.
[135:58.36]There's no reason to do this.
[135:59.10]I'm gonna die.
[136:01.43]Dropout.
[136:13.47]Do an Errantry?
[136:14.31]I think it's time to do an Errantry with her.
[136:16.04]I'm not giving up yet.
[136:26.54]No fans, that's fine.
[136:32.47]Don't spend your money here.
[136:34.87]That's true, because if I... No encouragement.
[136:43.42]We're too soft.
[136:44.72]We keep making... We spoil everybody.
[136:59.32]Sorry, hold on.
[137:00.02]I'm gonna need to read this.
[137:01.54]Sorry, I didn't mean to scare or upset you with the voodoo comment.
[137:04.40]I won't keep you updated on it anymore.
[137:06.85]I want some fucking warlocks in the chat right now, whoever you are.
[137:11.99]You need to counter that person.
[137:14.07]Don't update me, don't tell me about it, but just make sure that you're like countering that person's spells, right?
[137:20.64]I want some like wizards, like witches and warlocks.
[137:23.50]Just counter that person's spell, right?
[137:32.01]I will.
[137:32.45]Thank you.
[137:36.29]That person's casting spells on me.
[137:38.85]That's such a weird feeling.
[137:42.57]I don't want somebody to cast spells on me.
[137:44.30]Wouldn't that make you feel odd every day?
[137:54.30]I'll protect you.
[137:55.44]Okay.
[137:56.54]I just need some anti-magic spells on me.
[138:02.15]Alright.
[138:03.05]What do we do here?
[138:05.61]I'll tell you what we do.
[138:06.23]We're going to go pee.
[138:08.43]I will be right back.
[138:12.63]And we will continue.
[138:14.35]Be right back.
[140:32.21]Thank you.
[142:20.74]But it is... It's like 85 degrees in this room.
[142:29.57]Turn the fan off.
[142:35.47]You wash your hands?
[142:37.25]Always.
[142:39.81]Always.
[142:40.15]Oh, hey.
[142:46.53]Big pro tip.
[142:47.45]I'm eating something here.
[142:49.31]I'll tell you right now.
[142:52.04]I used to not like Clif Bars at all.
[142:55.92]But holy shit.
[142:58.42]The Blueberry Crisp Clif Bar.
[143:02.67]Cannot be compared to anything.
[143:06.23]It is so good.
[143:08.65]It's so good.
[143:11.43]Don't get the peanut butter and chocolate meme bullshit.
[143:15.29]Blueberry Crisp.
[143:16.83]Try it.
[143:17.48]I'm telling you.
[143:27.63]Chocolate mint.
[143:28.95]No, thank you.
[143:30.83]No, thank you.
[143:31.25]I'll take blueberry crisp, please.
[143:32.34]Want to see what it looks like?
[143:35.38]I don't even know why it's called blueberry crisp.
[143:45.11]It's just good.
[143:45.89]This just tastes good.
[143:56.32]I respect you a little bit less because of that statement.
[144:02.94]Nothing matters to me right now.
[144:03.92]I'm eating a blueberry crisp Clif Bar.
[144:05.62]Alright.
[144:10.88]What are we doing?
[144:18.82]I kind of want to just freeze her.
[144:20.47]I'll be honest.
[144:23.15]Clif Bar has gluten.
[144:25.26]What?
[144:27.86]What the?
[144:28.20]What'd you say?
[144:30.07]Are you kidding me?
[144:34.25]I'm going to freeze her.
[144:41.71]I don't want it.
[144:46.31]Might be maybe later.
[144:47.39]Game's too loud.
[144:50.14]I got it.
[144:57.03]You're still eating it?
[144:58.95]They're good.
[145:18.76]Which one?
[145:31.56]The remastered one's a little more pleasant.
[145:32.84]This one's a little harsher.
[145:33.78]Turn it off, too.
[145:38.88]Alright.
[145:40.27]Freeze.
[145:45.19]Freeze.
[145:48.55]I don't want to... Somebody said don't spend money.
[145:51.13]If I don't think I'm actually going to use this creature, I'm not going to spend money on it.
[145:57.57]Maybe later.
[145:57.99]I need some more songs, please.
[146:16.68]Rush?
[146:21.20]What's the song?
[146:22.55]The trouble with the maples.
[146:25.55]And they're quite convinced they're right.
[146:27.55]What's that song called?
[146:28.27]Freeze.
[146:35.51]Yeah, that's what I want.
[146:43.88]The trees, the sea, and the sun by Guy J. Sure.
[146:50.72]This is a big moment.
[147:00.16]Something cool.
[147:00.60]That's kind of a weirdo.
[147:08.06]It's the thing inside of the people's heads in Men in Black.
[147:11.66]Sorry if I spoiled a 30-year-old movie.
[147:15.95]Very energetic.
[147:17.63]Alright.
[147:17.91]Nope.
[147:40.09]Beastie Boys?
[147:47.32]How about, um... Hmm.
[147:58.91]Which one?
[147:59.27]How about Shake Your Rump?
[148:06.29]Shake Your Rump Remixed.
[148:07.54]Let's go.
[148:22.37]Whoa.
[148:24.45]Alright.
[148:25.95]What do you got?
[148:26.41]What do we got here?
[148:29.78]A bit scary looking, isn't it?
[148:33.46]Alright, I think I can work.
[148:34.70]That's actually not bad.
[148:57.09]Space.
[148:57.59]I love Batman.
[149:04.39]Let's go.
[149:05.49]What?
[149:28.36]It's a snake?
[149:31.84]Alright, sorry.
[149:34.12]I didn't know you were such an expert.
[149:36.76]In Monster Rancher 2, uh, monster types.
[149:46.95]What do you like?
[149:52.91]Oh, you like cup jelly.
[149:54.45]You don't like potatoes, that's perfect.
[150:00.82]This hit percentage is awful.
[150:03.28]The whack and belly punch.
[150:04.94]Deep.
[150:09.66]Shit, you kind of suck.
[150:13.31]I'm going to send this guy on an errantry.
[150:21.13]What should we do?
[150:21.86]Just straight up power?
[150:37.86]No!
[150:37.98]Come on!
[150:40.78]Get back in there.
[150:42.56]Come on, dude.
[151:20.87]Breeze, no.
[151:24.15]That was pretty good for a baby.
[151:29.43]That was actually really good for a baby.
[151:37.61]He looks like you put your action figure in the microwave.
[151:43.35]Maybe a little.
[151:45.11]What's going on here, by the way?
[151:47.15]I don't like this part.
[151:50.10]You know what I'm saying?
[151:51.62]I don't like this part.
[151:54.84]See what I mean?
[152:04.94]Take a rest.
[152:07.32]Shave it.
[152:18.13]F.
[152:22.45]Should we just do it?
[152:23.11]See if we can just kick people's asses.
[152:31.64]What's the next one?
[152:33.00]Alright, this one will be easy.
[152:35.78]We'll do this one.
[152:37.74]A couple weeks.
[152:46.28]Get in there.
[152:50.47]Okay.
[152:51.15]You're freaking me out here.
[152:57.01]Do it again.
[153:02.27]You like cup of jelly, which is perfect.
[153:07.40]I have to make some money.
[153:08.10]I'm kind of just burning through my five grand.
[153:16.62]What is it?
[153:18.71]Can I get some mail?
[153:27.42]I'm setting him.
[153:33.17]I'm setting him on Errantry.
[153:34.01]It's half off.
[153:50.06]Speed?
[153:50.48]Life?
[153:53.28]What do they got?
[153:55.44]Speed life, intelligence life, skill life, power life.
[153:59.28]This is the one.
[154:03.34]He's not going to gain anything, but he might learn a move.
[154:08.06]He is too low intelligence.
[154:09.92]Won't he potentially learn a move?
[154:17.93]He needs more hit chance.
[154:22.51]Needs intelligence.
[154:25.26]I don't know.
[154:29.36]Just send them?
[154:32.70]Let them die, who cares?
[154:33.90]How long have you been eating at that single cliff bar?
[154:38.21]You don't know much about cliff bars.
[154:39.45]Cliff bars can take sometimes like four hours to eat completely.
[154:44.35]They take like 40 minutes to eat.
[154:48.47]They're like... They last like an hour.
[154:59.16]It's so much nutrients and, like, protein packed in one cube.
[155:02.68]It takes a little while.
[155:03.62]What, are you trying to make me choke?
[155:06.93]Uh, maybe this is a stupid idea, but... Yeah, I don't have enough money.
[155:10.65]I really just don't.
[155:11.25]Let's do, uh, hit chance, which is skill, right?
[155:14.87]Let me see your data.
[155:18.19]Yeah, your skill is absolute dogshit.
[155:21.77]Alright, we'll do skill.
[155:33.76]Come on.
[155:34.36]You're cheating.
[155:36.53]Could you at least get points?
[155:41.17]You got one point.
[155:47.79]Don't do that.
[155:49.54]Do it legitimately, please.
[155:50.52]Get in there.
[156:02.58]Don't cheat.
[156:07.51]Oh, come on!
[156:08.47]You failed it?
[156:12.67]This guy's really just real dumb.
[156:19.63]I won't scold you this time.
[156:27.03]Back into the microwave.
[156:28.23]A microwaved action figure.
[156:36.36]When's this fight?
[156:37.74]No, he's not ready.
[156:41.62]Might be ready for the official cup if I can actually get you to do what you're supposed to do and stop screwing around.
[156:45.75]Hit it.
[157:11.77]His skill is so bad, it's gonna take so long to get him.
[157:17.06]Do it again, get in there, and actually do it this time.
[157:20.07]You're wasting so many weeks.
[157:41.25]Stop it!
[157:42.19]Get in there and do it the right way!
[157:43.94]Go get Bonnie back.
[157:47.08]I think Bonnie... I think we go get Bonnie.
[157:55.24]Bonnie's loyal.
[157:56.82]Fast.
[157:57.82]Strong.
[157:58.42]Intelligent.
[157:59.58]Quick.
[158:02.22]I'm gonna give this guy one more month.
[158:04.54]If he's still... Annoying.
[158:07.58]And we're putting him into the ice.
[158:10.22]Gotta give him at least one tournament.
[158:15.99]I know it's there.
[158:16.79]It's dressed out.
[158:20.32]Oh shit.
[158:25.58]What the fuck was that?
[158:26.58]He got a weird scream, I like it.
[158:33.07]Eat a mint leaf.
[158:36.43]I could sell it too.
[158:38.11]I could sell him a town.
[158:50.56]Fuse with Noodle.
[158:54.57]I don't know if I want to fuse this guy with Noodle.
[158:59.39]We'll do the battle this month.
[159:02.15]This one here.
[159:03.33]No, the E one.
[159:04.83]It's the official one.
[159:10.08]I do like that sound effect, though.
[159:12.02]I do like it.
[159:12.60]Combine two shit monsters?
[159:16.50]It costs money.
[159:17.04]I think it's like 500 gold or something.
[159:20.03]I don't have enough money to do that.
[159:21.15]I have to win a tournament.
[159:27.13]Please don't cheat and actually do it this time.
[159:31.02]This little shit, I swear to God.
[159:38.60]Look at this terrible increase.
[159:52.01]wins the battle alright we're gonna rest and then train and then rest do it for real this time please oh my god why can you not do any uh why
[160:21.37]Well, let's see how good you are in a tournament.
[160:30.77]You need to ice this dude.
[160:31.77]Not yet.
[160:32.61]He might be really good in the tournament.
[160:37.11]He's unruly.
[160:37.91]He doesn't listen.
[160:39.33]But what if he just KOs people in three hits?
[160:47.45]I'll try it.
[160:48.15]Let's go.
[160:54.66]We need money.
[160:57.92]Like, really badly, actually.
[160:59.10]I'm gonna start to burn too much money.
[161:02.48]If I go below a thousand gold, then we have to just go get Barney.
[161:06.05]And just try to just win tournaments.
[161:12.51]Alright, what we got?
[161:15.33]Same shitties that we saw last time?
[161:17.27]Yeah.
[161:21.69]Alright, let's see what you got.
[161:22.79]Both these moves are pretty bad.
[161:25.34]They're like probably 30% chance to hit.
[161:29.08]Uh... I don't... This doesn't look good.
[161:37.68]42% chance to hit.
[161:40.50]This one does more damage though, doesn't it?
[161:41.74]Belly Punch?
[161:50.33]Come on, do it.
[161:54.73]Do it!
[161:55.55]That was pretty good.
[161:58.61]That was actually really good.
[162:00.71]L.A.
[162:00.83]Punch is great.
[162:06.73]Stop.
[162:07.19]Just close the gap here, please.
[162:24.44]Finally!
[162:25.02]Jesus!
[162:32.06]Just win.
[162:32.68]Who cares?
[162:33.06]You don't have to KO everybody.
[162:43.25]Okay.
[162:47.37]Boo!
[162:48.59]Boo!
[162:53.95]I'm getting a headache.
[162:55.81]Trying to drink water.
[162:56.37]I'm going to literally no life this game though.
[163:07.98]End of the stream?
[163:08.56]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[163:09.72]I'm very invested in this.
[163:12.72]It's voodoo bullshit.
[163:13.94]Stop voodooing me.
[163:19.64]Uh, this I'm going to probably lose.
[163:22.43]Because this is power versus power.
[163:23.67]Hit chance is way more important sometimes than just power, because I'm going to miss half the things I swing at him.
[163:33.56]That's a cool profile picture, though.
[163:34.91]I like the profile picture for Bug Batman.
[163:36.35]Alright, we're going to... Get him.
[163:51.56]Come on.
[163:52.02]The thwack has such a terrible hit percentage.
[163:59.41]51%.
[164:01.93]That's so bad.
[164:06.09]No, don't do... Holy shit, that was a lot.
[164:07.65]Don't do anything but belly punches.
[164:08.73]No reason not to.
[164:09.25]He's just getting confused.
[164:15.34]Alright.
[164:18.08]I don't hate this guy.
[164:25.64]I do see a little bit of potential with Bug Batman.
[164:38.52]Probably going to lose the one versus Oakley Man, though.
[164:44.40]Oakley Man has lost once.
[164:48.48]Hopefully they lose twice.
[164:49.22]Then we're good.
[164:58.43]I played this game my entire teens growing up.
[165:00.25]It's my favorite game of all time, so happy you're playing it.
[165:02.31]This is probably one of the most fun games ever.
[165:04.68]I would put Monster Rancher 2 somewhere in, like, the top 10.
[165:09.86]I'm really glad that they're supporting it still.
[165:12.57]Uh...
[165:16.40]I would love for them to do another one.
[165:17.58]And by the way, steal this from me.
[165:19.35]If you want to do a Monster Rancher 5, or like even if you did a Monster Rancher, just get rid of the numbers and just make Monster Rancher, right?
[165:27.31]Like everybody does now is you get too many high numbers, you remake the whole thing, whatever.
[165:32.80]Make it URLs.
[165:35.38]URLs, simple.
[165:38.19]Like, I think that's a no brainer.
[165:43.08]QR codes.
[165:43.66]I think that they have this system here that is song data.
[165:50.03]But you could just like kind of just grab a shitload of website stuff and just have it be URL based.
[165:57.53]Either that or Steam games or QR codes.
[165:59.09]Yeah, there's at least two or three ways to do it.
[166:04.28]Pornhub.
[166:07.66]I'm just saying URLs would work.
[166:14.94]Do it from a photo on mobile.
[166:16.68]Yeah, there's so many cool things you can do.
[166:19.31]I'm available.
[166:22.33]I'm available.
[166:28.11]All I ask for very, very basically, simply, is 60 to 70% of all the gross sales.
[166:35.13]That's it.
[166:35.69]And that's like not even a big deal.
[166:36.87]That's not even like a high price to pay.
[166:39.37]Like a fucking idea like that.
[166:42.62]It's not even like really that much.
[166:49.78]Good dodge.
[166:53.58]So if you're wondering why the question marks keep popping up, is the monster has low loyalty and is really young.
[166:59.52]So when I tell it to do that move, I just see the little blue bar when it crosses over and I hit the button.
[167:05.38]He's a little stupid.
[167:06.44]He's too young.
[167:07.18]He doesn't really know what I want him to do.
[167:09.04]And he messes up.
[167:09.64]But holy shit, does he hit hard.
[167:13.29]It's really hard.
[167:19.45]This is another win.
[167:25.47]Hang on, I'm right here.
[167:28.93]One more.
[167:30.39]Good.
[167:30.63]Oof.
[167:30.71]47 damage.
[167:35.23]What a dumb fuck.
[167:39.21]He's like three months old.
[167:42.86]He's two months old.
[167:44.10]Imagine like you have like a baby in your life.
[167:48.36]Like an infant.
[167:50.38]I don't know whether it's like a friend's or a family member's baby and you go over to the baby and the baby's like kind of in the crib just like kind of giggling and laughing and shit and like people are like shaking keys and you just lean in and say what a dumb fuck.
[168:05.05]You're not going to get invited to Christmas again.
[168:07.35]I don't understand where you think you're coming from here.
[168:12.85]You're not going to get invited to Thanksgiving.
[168:17.89]That's objectively true.
[168:19.38]Because your babies are stupid.
[168:21.66]Their brain hasn't even developed.
[168:28.62]Get it in the ring.
[168:31.77]So why are you playing a baby cage fighting game?
[168:35.63]They're babies.
[168:36.83]They grow up.
[168:38.23]It's not babies forever.
[168:39.81]They're not just babies.
[168:40.71]They're little.
[168:41.23]They grow up.
[168:41.85]They get big and strong.
[168:47.72]Why are you making babies fight each other?
[168:57.29]Oh yeah?
[169:00.65]Your favorite game... PUCKET MONSTERS!
[169:03.99]Pokémon!
[169:06.45]You throw this little fucking circle at these guys, and you trap them into this, like, 12 by- like, 4 by 4 inch cert cube.
[169:17.36]Do you see how- how these guys are?
[169:19.54]They have, like, a big house.
[169:22.36]They're, like, out- out in the grass and shit.
[169:26.58]The Pokeball that you're trapping these Pokeballs, these Pokemonsters in there.
[169:37.53]It's a cube.
[169:38.11]It's a circle.
[169:40.93]Free range Pokémon.
[169:46.35]They like it in there.
[169:50.54]Okay.
[169:52.30]You're literally freezing a monster on a whim in this game.
[170:02.48]Hold on.
[170:02.78]I got something important to do.
[170:05.86]Not bad.
[170:07.71]I think I might just run away now.
[170:09.23]You get one more hit and run away.
[170:10.39]And just let the time go up.
[170:13.79]That's bad.
[170:16.89]Give me an opportunity to move.
[170:18.35]For God's sakes.
[170:19.15]Come on!
[170:25.57]66%.
[170:25.65]Oh my goodness gracious.
[170:32.84]I'm about to put this guy in the fucking cooler with all like the Pepsis and the bottles of water.
[170:36.61]Hit punch!
[170:46.19]Don't let him just zone you like that.
[170:47.90]Get in there!
[170:52.98]It's not getting too much help.
[170:58.76]Whatever.
[171:07.96]Would you eat a Pikachu egg?
[171:13.41]No, but I also wouldn't eat anything besides a chicken egg.
[171:21.69]Do Pikachus have live birth?
[171:26.97]How does it work?
[171:29.91]The eggs?
[171:31.25]What is it?
[171:32.95]All Pokemons lay eggs.
[171:34.49]They do?
[171:34.89]It's eggs?
[171:40.94]Even Wailord?
[171:43.10]Wailord is like a gigantic egg?
[171:46.30]As big as a house?
[171:50.95]I don't... No, Wailord has live birth, guys.
[171:54.65]I'm sorry.
[172:04.06]Wailord comes from an egg.
[172:09.36]Ban this conversation.
[172:13.08]Like, we can't talk about, like, the chicken and eggs and stuff?
[172:21.13]Okay, let me- I want to make sure this is very clear to everybody.
[172:24.21]Me talking about Wailord's, uh, eggs, or birth, whatever, is not okay.
[172:31.57]But zooming in on my ass when I get up from the chair, and, like, look at his huge ass, that's okay?
[172:37.51]That's fine?
[172:42.87]I just want to be clear about what you got, what's appropriate to you in the chat room.
[172:48.01]Don't talk about eggs, eel.
[172:49.03]Oh, don't talk about eggs.
[172:51.07]Zooming on his ass.
[172:52.03]Zooming on his ass.
[172:53.25]Oh, zooming on his ass.
[172:55.39]That's, which one's fine again?
[172:59.76]I'm just trying to understand.
[173:14.91]Alright, let's beat this guy's ass.
[173:17.25]Do it again.
[173:24.71]String it together.
[173:25.23]Don't even let him do anything.
[173:26.39]Be the first one to do the input.
[173:31.00]I don't have... Back it up.
[173:31.78]I don't have enough guts.
[173:34.24]Spit.
[173:34.62]Back it up.
[173:38.48]Pull it back.
[173:42.79]Run the clock out a little bit here.
[173:44.01]I don't want to lose.
[173:45.69]Punch?
[173:45.93]Oh, come on, dude.
[173:48.96]That lick is a ton of damage, too.
[173:50.46]I'm glad I didn't get hit by it.
[173:56.86]You just let these guys spit in your face over and over again.
[173:59.03]Are you really going to let them just do this?
[174:05.99]Again, again, again, again, again, again.
[174:10.79]There it is.
[174:18.94]That actually might have been really bad.
[174:23.24]I love Swayzo.
[174:26.46]I kind of want one of those guys.
[174:33.94]Oh, Oakley, man.
[174:35.26]I think I'm going to lose the tournament.
[174:37.04]Alright, come on, Leon.
[174:41.60]Beat him.
[174:42.62]Come on.
[174:44.90]That's a very...
[174:49.72]Tournament over, I won.
[174:52.46]Nice.
[174:56.13]Nobody has four wins, right?
[174:57.91]Nope.
[174:58.51]That's it.
[175:01.99]Hog Batman is the winner.
[175:10.28]Okay, now I can't freeze him.
[175:12.62]Because he just did an official cup.
[175:15.40]Rank E.
[175:23.32]Remember the Monster Rancher anime?
[175:24.58]I never saw it.
[175:25.16]I never watched it.
[175:32.04]How do you get less fame than Arnie?
[175:39.39]Learn something from that.
[175:43.93]That's pretty good.
[175:46.19]Those are good increases.
[175:48.51]Now, just listen to me, and just do what you're supposed to do, and you'll grow up really big and strong.
[175:58.60]Listen.
[176:01.80]Go, don't cheat, and just try to do a little bit of work.
[176:09.52]Cup of jelly.
[176:12.71]Why are you playing two and not one?
[176:14.39]Um, in my opinion, two is just the same game as one, but more stuff to do.
[176:21.27]One's a little more direct, I think.
[176:24.91]I think two is a better game.
[176:26.78]As much as I love all of them.
[176:29.38]Besides the fourth one.
[176:30.16]The fourth one was awful.
[176:36.52]Monster Rancher 4 was truly an unbearable game.
[176:39.53]It was awful.
[176:42.22]Oh, is that, wait, is that Evo?
[176:44.22]Evo.
[176:44.66]Which one, what's the bad, what's the really awful one?
[176:47.86]It's 3, 4, or Evo.
[176:49.44]I don't remember which one it is.
[176:50.80]Well, one of them is terrible.
[176:55.81]Evo is the bad one.
[176:56.59]I think, whatever the last one was made, because that probably just, I guess what Capcom is probably just like, this is not even Capcom.
[177:07.30]I'm just saying a wrong company name.
[177:11.98]Wait, it wasn't a Capcom?
[177:14.84]Who made this?
[177:18.48]Didn't Koei Tecmo make this?
[177:21.08]Wait, didn't Capcom make the first one?
[177:22.70]I'm so confused.
[177:25.78]Why do I think Capcom made the first one?
[177:31.12]I don't know.
[177:33.16]Alright, do it.
[177:36.10]Please, don't cheat.
[177:41.19]There it is.
[177:42.15]Oh my god, you can't do this.
[177:43.13]You just can't do it.
[177:48.64]I don't think he's capable of doing the skill-based training.
[177:54.44]Without cheating.
[177:58.27]I really don't think so.
[177:59.15]We've tried it like seven times.
[178:00.25]I'm going to try this one more time.
[178:13.82]Finally, you actually did it.
[178:21.10]Good, you got more than one point.
[178:22.65]Do it again.
[178:32.63]Uh, I don't want to do this tournament.
[178:37.22]Bonus disc chips.
[178:38.56]Ooh, I think those are actually worth having.
[178:40.64]I might try that.
[178:42.24]No, maybe the next one.
[178:43.10]This one here.
[178:44.70]Bonus magic banana.
[178:45.82]2,000 gold.
[178:46.86]Alright, we're doing this one.
[178:49.54]Uh, I want you to get more power.
[178:53.57]4,000 gold.
[179:01.09]Dude.
[179:03.65]You're getting tablets next month.
[179:15.72]Tablets.
[179:18.36]Take the tablets.
[179:24.18]Why is this thing such an asshole?
[179:25.20]Because it's got like bad nature and it's scary or whatever, right?
[179:28.62]So like it wants to cheat and it's evil or whatever.
[179:31.46]To do D rank, we need at least 180.
[179:49.43]You're just wasting all of my time and money.
[179:59.76]Oh, you're tired?
[180:00.40]Are you tired?
[180:07.93]Come here.
[180:09.29]Take a mint leaf and take a nut oil.
[180:14.69]You're killing him.
[180:16.15]I'm not killing him.
[180:17.08]He's failing at his task.
[180:22.79]This is a child.
[180:27.85]I'm trying to be... I'm trying to... You can rest.
[180:38.76]He's a failure.
[180:41.18]Not really, because he just won a tournament.
[180:44.36]Alright, you're doing very well.
[180:45.96]You had some mint.
[180:46.98]You had some tea.
[180:47.90]You had some delicious, like, sunflower oil.
[180:50.60]Now get in there and crush it.
[180:55.65]Do it.
[180:58.43]I know you can.
[181:04.13]Now we praise.
[181:04.77]That's a big increase, too.
[181:09.01]I think I get this to 200.
[181:09.93]Where's the one that's above 4,000 gold?
[181:17.92]Alright, it's this one coming up.
[181:19.80]Round Robin, four entries.
[181:21.38]I don't know if he's strong enough.
[181:22.58]2,000 gold.
[181:30.45]Should I try?
[181:36.49]I'll try it.
[181:39.40]Or do another E. I'm going to go for it.
[181:49.20]Rest up.
[181:49.78]Let's go.
[181:51.34]See if we can get you in the D rank.
[181:57.24]The F1 is 4k.
[182:03.33]Jelly.
[182:04.39]Let me go look at that again.
[182:08.61]It was 4,000?
[182:08.83]Anybody here?
[182:25.81]Air entry is cheaper.
[182:26.93]This one's... Where are you seeing 4,000 gold from?
[182:42.68]No, the only one that's here that's more than 1,000 gold is this one.
[182:50.29]I'm sending him on the trip.
[182:56.70]It was the F1s.
[182:59.46]I got... I only have 1,800 gold.
[183:01.34]I don't know.
[183:04.24]Is it worth it?
[183:12.25]It's 1,000 bucks.
[183:13.21]I'll have $800 left.
[183:14.29]I'm going to softlock myself.
[183:18.83]Get in there.
[183:19.43]Come on.
[183:19.85]I know you got what it takes.
[183:21.08]Let's go.
[183:24.34]I know you got what it takes.
[183:25.52]Get in there.
[183:32.27]If you don't, you're getting frozen.
[183:36.59]Spring rain.
[183:38.69]Under this condition, Parapare's Cup is about to start.
[183:44.50]Let's win.
[183:45.96]This is going to be a short tournament.
[183:46.84]There's only four entrants.
[183:49.74]Winston, Capella, and Sleet Bomb.
[183:55.74]Sleet Bomb.
[184:00.75]I think this guy has a lot of... Oh, okay.
[184:09.70]This is a war of... I gotta hit him once and then run away.
[184:18.80]Come in slow, yeah.
[184:21.30]You idiot.
[184:22.56]Dodge!
[184:24.35]No, you're not an idiot.
[184:24.87]I was just kidding.
[184:25.37]I made it up.
[184:27.37]Get one hit and just...
[184:33.71]Good.
[184:37.19]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[184:38.51]Back it up, back it up.
[184:40.93]Nice job, dude.
[184:41.77]Excellent work.
[184:45.92]Back, back, back!
[184:49.34]Dodge!
[184:53.94]Dodge!
[184:55.36]Oh, he's good!
[184:57.60]Dodge!
[184:58.30]Holy shit, this is so much RNG that's going in our favor here.
[185:03.92]Dodge!
[185:07.50]Dodge!
[185:08.74]No!
[185:13.43]Just keep hitting him!
[185:15.31]Take win by percentages!
[185:16.63]He's so slow!
[185:31.59]Shit.
[185:33.91]It's alright.
[185:34.29]Alright, I gotta win this one.
[185:45.30]I'll get prize money if I come in at least second or third place.
[185:47.50]Come on.
[185:54.48]This defense is so high.
[185:59.54]Isn't this an intelligence monster?
[186:03.07]Well, let's see.
[186:03.85]No, it's not, I guess.
[186:04.79]That's weird.
[186:07.51]Good start.
[186:08.25]Again.
[186:09.71]Just pissed him off.
[186:10.33]Great.
[186:10.59]Do it again.
[186:11.37]Just unlock.
[186:12.63]Lock him up.
[186:20.91]Back it up.
[186:21.23]Back it up.
[186:21.51]Back it up.
[186:21.81]Back it up.
[186:22.11]Back it up.
[186:28.96]Good.
[186:29.42]Again.
[186:32.61]Oh, what the fuck was that move?
[186:34.39]Oh my god, he cubed me.
[186:41.96]Yes!
[186:42.18]Can you please win?
[186:49.66]I just did.
[186:50.37]Okay, now I at least get some prize money.
[187:02.24]I need Winston to lose.
[187:03.24]I mean, Sleep Bomb is the favorite.
[187:05.80]What?
[187:07.10]You're not the favorite.
[187:12.88]What's so special about Winston?
[187:19.74]Oh.
[187:21.32]Dude, this... 86 health, 100 power?
[187:26.84]This character sucks.
[187:29.08]Oh, it's because it's intelligence moves.
[187:33.31]It's not a power.
[187:34.13]Okay, I have to... Here's the strategy.
[187:37.76]Get in close.
[187:39.26]And just spam.
[187:40.70]I just gotta hit him a few times.
[187:44.34]He doesn't even have intelligence moves.
[187:46.70]Look at his moves.
[187:47.24]He has all power moves.
[187:53.43]Bro, how you win... Bro.
[187:55.03]Bro, how are you winning so many moves?
[187:57.71]How did you win against the huge guy?
[187:59.25]Hey, bro.
[188:06.35]Again.
[188:06.57]If I win this, this is huge.
[188:11.51]Stop getting confused.
[188:12.41]It's a big deal if I win.
[188:23.96]Oh my god, dude!
[188:25.22]Fucking hit him!
[188:29.04]Oh my god, fucking hit him with one goddamn move, you shitty guy.
[188:33.59]You shitty guy.
[188:52.27]We still win.
[188:55.69]It doesn't kind of hurt to do that.
[189:00.56]I don't like this part.
[189:09.55]Oh no, I have to fight him again.
[189:12.79]Wait a minute.
[189:13.95]This is a three-way tie.
[189:15.67]Alright, Winston versus Sleep Bomb, and Sleep Bomb wins.
[189:22.17]Sleep Bomb... Okay, tiebreaker.
[189:29.53]Shit, whoever wins this has to fight Sleep Bomb.
[189:39.45]Wait.
[189:41.74]Right?
[189:42.96]Nice V-neck.
[189:43.60]Alright, I beat him once.
[189:46.86]I can beat him again.
[189:47.36]I got really unlucky at the end there.
[189:49.44]My percentages just died for some reason.
[189:53.01]Okay.
[189:54.95]Same strategy.
[189:55.69]Just gotta hit him a few times.
[189:56.59]Don't miss it.
[189:59.09]36%.
[189:59.15]His speed is so high.
[190:08.34]Here we go.
[190:09.38]Again.
[190:10.36]Just two more of those.
[190:18.58]Back up.
[190:20.20]Thank God you missed that because that was an intelligence move that would have killed me probably in one hit.
[190:24.76]Do not back up.
[190:26.58]Don't get in range of that shit.
[190:42.32]Yes!
[190:44.08]Got him.
[190:53.65]Are we farming today?
[190:54.49]Farming what?
[190:56.57]What emote am I farming?
[190:59.97]Alright.
[191:00.29]How?
[191:02.23]How did I win?
[191:05.83]Dude, that's 2,000 fucking gold.
[191:10.06]How did I just win that?
[191:10.68]Wasn't it two and one?
[191:11.70]There were three people that were two and one.
[191:14.06]Did I win by more or something?
[191:15.90]Higher seeds?
[191:18.50]Oh, okay.
[191:23.26]21.
[191:23.36]I was about to be bankrupt.
[191:24.64]Thank God.
[191:27.96]I got a magic banana.
[191:29.12]Okay.
[191:35.60]What's a magic banana do?
[191:40.33]Ooh, we learned something.
[191:42.71]That's not bad.
[191:45.31]I would have liked to see health in there, but oh well.
[191:51.81]Good job.
[191:54.81]You're really powerful, you're just untrainable.
[191:58.85]Okay, what do we got?
[192:01.19]Power.
[192:11.37]What's the banana do?
[192:15.29]I told you to leave it alone, bug man.
[192:19.64]Do Errantry.
[192:27.21]It's gonna be two grand!
[192:30.15]Oh, it's still the same month.
[192:32.61]Alright.
[192:32.89]Power, life?
[192:34.96]Is there skill?
[192:35.76]Alright.
[192:36.22]Do we go for the skill in life or do we go for power in life?
[192:42.98]Hit harder or be able to hit more often?
[192:47.52]Skill?
[192:54.07]Errantry will take... Yeah, this is... Somebody has an... This is absolutely good advice here.
[192:58.49]Errantry takes away from the monster's life.
[193:00.15]He doesn't have high enough stats yet to succeed at the trials in it.
[193:06.49]Really?
[193:06.75]Hmm.
[193:20.96]Send him anyway.
[193:25.73]Do you want to send your monster to this Errantry location?
[193:31.93]Wanted.
[193:38.00]Oh, there's a wanted posters?
[193:40.50]Whoa.
[193:42.34]We probably should do the one with the E, right?
[193:49.06]Okay, we'll do the bunny.
[193:53.94]Okay.
[193:54.56]Let's go.
[193:56.10]This is important.
[194:11.49]Alright.
[194:12.57]That was a nice spin.
[194:14.85]He split it.
[194:15.25]He got it.
[194:15.89]That's a success.
[194:20.03]He got it.
[194:24.81]Oh yeah, that's a lot.
[194:28.77]Another one.
[194:34.40]Go for it.
[194:37.64]There's a dog here in my mouth.
[194:40.34]Land it!
[194:44.04]Oh!
[194:45.14]That's gonna be a great success.
[194:50.45]Alright.
[194:56.36]It's a little sloppy, but he made it.
[194:59.44]Hungry Sharks.
[195:04.74]Nice.
[195:05.50]Watch out.
[195:08.03]He's good.
[195:08.61]This is going to be like a plus 20 skill.
[195:10.35]Come on, make it.
[195:18.41]That's alright.
[195:19.17]That was a big one.
[195:21.15]That's alright.
[195:21.48]That was a big one.
[195:24.18]Hungry Sharks again.
[195:26.43]You can do it.
[195:27.46]One.
[195:29.20]Left side.
[195:32.20]Even side.
[195:33.90]Handle it!
[195:38.16]Get him!
[195:40.71]No!
[196:02.21]Okay.
[196:03.33]Would he gain, like, 12, 13 stats?
[196:06.49]You're too hard on it.
[196:07.49]He's gonna pass out.
[196:09.29]What?
[196:16.72]Have some nut oil.
[196:26.87]Mint leaf is stress reduction.
[196:28.19]Nut oil is fatigue reduction, by the way.
[196:35.28]Alright.
[196:35.94]Rest.
[196:36.06]You tried.
[196:36.56]It says I'm soft.
[196:38.96]What do you mean too hard?
[196:42.60]Let him rest.
[196:43.10]Oh my god.
[196:47.83]What happened?
[196:59.27]Ooh.
[197:03.09]Not strong enough.
[197:04.29]We'll go for this one.
[197:07.48]That's two grand and a Gemini's pot.
[197:09.16]Alright, I gotta get him trained up.
[197:10.77]Alright, is it time to begin the hard training?
[197:25.86]Use that magic banana.
[197:29.62]These are big increases.
[197:37.96]item use magic its effect differs each time you feed it to your monster so what does it do remember this is not related to any voodoo stuff I was just curious about how your left ear is um that's actually kind of funny that you say that because my left ear has been ringing for the last like six months thanks a lot thanks a lot appreciate it thank you thanks a lot
[198:16.89]I'm going to hold it for now.
[198:17.83]Alright, those of you lore masters, is me doing these hard ones now worth doing even though they're very damaging?
[198:32.28]Is he old enough?
[198:38.53]How old are you?
[198:43.25]Six months old.
[198:47.05]He's still too, still too young?
[198:53.66]I don't know if he's matured yet.
[198:59.86]Do them but use a mint leaf.
[199:00.82]Alright, I'm gonna see how, I'm gonna, let's see how old, if he's old enough.
[199:04.56]We're gonna do pole.
[199:07.27]And then I'm going to use a mint leaf.
[199:09.93]I'm going to see.
[199:10.47]I'm curious.
[199:15.34]These add way more stats.
[199:17.96]But they're really, really taxing.
[199:19.28]You got it?
[199:25.51]I'd say that's pretty damn good.
[199:40.71]Tablets.
[199:42.42]You need skill.
[199:49.36]We'll do that after this.
[199:56.15]I know.
[199:56.45]Okay, okay, okay.
[199:59.33]You need speed, too.
[200:11.17]I stopped.
[200:16.55]How can you tell when he's going to pass away?
[200:19.55]Um... Depending on what type of monster it is, different monsters live longer.
[200:25.03]Because like I said, there's base types and then there's subtypes, right?
[200:28.83]So this is a base type of whatever the snake monster is.
[200:33.19]And a subtype of something else.
[200:35.75]And they both have, like, the snake monster.
[200:40.59]As all snake monsters live for a base time of four years.
[200:46.31]Uh, the, uh, like, Swayzo lives for an average, usually, of three years, and it kind of just combines the two types.
[200:54.19]So, some monsters live longer than others, and then stress and fatigue obviously weighs on it heavily, too.
[201:01.36]So.
[201:01.68]This game might seem pretty simple, but there's a lot of in-the-background stuff that you need to be aware of.
[201:07.82]When's this battle?
[201:13.73]Alright, we're gonna train and then we're gonna do power with skill.
[201:21.29]Skill.
[201:22.93]Go for it.
[201:24.11]Don't cheat.
[201:29.58]Good job.
[201:35.14]Plus five at least.
[201:35.82]Good.
[201:43.37]And you still use CDs.
[201:44.35]You cannot.
[201:46.52]How the game handles it in this port is there's just a gigantic database of hundreds of thousands of songs and CD data.
[201:56.50]And you just pick it and one comes out.
[202:01.42]And you CDs nuts.
[202:03.08]And then you laughed with all capitals.
[202:04.50]That's pretty good.
[202:14.80]Alright, we need that two grand.
[202:18.94]Oh, what a fucking classic.
[202:26.04]Alright, here we go.
[202:27.70]2,000 gold in a Gemini's pot.
[202:28.72]Let's see if I can win this one.
[202:39.94]Why are you doing the black tourmaline copypasta?
[202:47.95]Alright, let's go for it.
[202:49.87]Big tournament, only four.
[202:53.68]Paramount?
[202:54.44]Capella.
[202:54.84]Alright, we've seen Capella.
[202:57.22]Millium.
[202:59.74]Alright, good luck, Bug Batman.
[203:10.79]I just got to hit you like once.
[203:15.03]Twice.
[203:17.14]Shouldn't be too bad.
[203:19.47]Stay close.
[203:20.03]This is an intelligence monster.
[203:21.85]Again, stunlock.
[203:27.43]It's a 1 in 3 chance to hit right now.
[203:32.78]Stay close.
[203:34.16]Literally 4 damage.
[203:34.94]Who cares?
[203:35.66]Easy.
[203:39.01]Stay close.
[203:49.77]Come on.
[203:50.87]28% chance to hit.
[203:55.32]I just dropped my guts.
[203:56.14]50% chance to hit.
[204:10.84]I'll just fine.
[204:11.56]I'll just win by... It doesn't matter.
[204:14.24]You can't even hurt me.
[204:16.82]okay that's fine just keep doing no damage whatever you still lost I just got angry alright that's good that at least potentially guarantees us some prize money why is Jerma a bad mood what
[204:44.20]I'm not in a bad mood.
[204:44.98]What are you talking about?
[204:45.84]I'm having fun just hanging out and playing the game.
[204:48.12]I'm not in a bad mood.
[204:48.90]What are you talking about?
[204:49.68]Bad mood?
[204:51.48]What?
[204:51.70]How come you're not doing anything funny?
[205:00.08]Why do I have to do something funny?
[205:03.64]I'm enjoying my favorite game of all time when I was 16!
[205:05.48]It's because he's so red.
[205:17.05]Smugger?
[205:17.64]Um, why am I?
[205:19.46]What did I do?
[205:20.10]I'm not smug.
[205:22.04]What did I do?
[205:23.76]He hates streaming.
[205:24.94]What did he do?
[205:25.44]Why didn't I do?
[205:26.10]I didn't do anything.
[205:26.78]I didn't do anything.
[205:39.98]What?
[205:43.23]Stay back.
[205:44.37]Watch out for that thing.
[205:46.17]He does that dice thing and it does like 50 damage.
[205:50.35]Don't let him dice you.
[205:54.02]This motherfucker needs a new move so bad.
[205:59.88]What the fuck was that?
[206:04.46]Dude, will you attack him?
[206:26.02]That's not enough, right?
[206:39.93]He's redder than Boston baked beans?
[206:42.53]Baked beans are, like, what are you talking about?
[206:44.62]They're not red.
[206:45.70]Those are, like, regular baked beans.
[206:48.68]Regular beans.
[206:50.82]Beans?
[206:51.18]Yeah, they are red.
[206:52.84]Boston baked beans.
[207:05.14]I just made 100k.
[207:06.20]Well, you're going to lose this next one because I'm going to... His defense is so bad.
[207:12.86]As long as I can hit him.
[207:14.96]A little, like, owl?
[207:16.16]I just have to land it.
[207:21.30]We got to just focus only on skill.
[207:23.78]Here we go.
[207:29.24]Good.
[207:29.36]Get back.
[207:29.62]Again.
[207:32.22]Again.
[207:40.60]Alright, he doesn't hurt at all.
[207:41.60]It's fine.
[207:43.46]Guard.
[207:43.88]Good job.
[207:56.59]Why are they booing that?
[207:58.25]That was a cool move.
[208:05.43]I need two wins.
[208:07.37]Really, I mean, three.
[208:09.21]Don't even... Okay, we're good.
[208:11.97]Go for the kill shot here.
[208:14.41]Kill.
[208:15.49]Get more points.
[208:15.95]Everyone's fucking booing me.
[208:19.78]Why do you look like Woody Harrelson?
[208:32.00]I'll tell ya.
[208:33.02]It's gonna be carnage.
[208:35.59]I remember when I saw that, I was like, that was awful.
[208:39.51]Well, I'm just telling you something.
[208:40.89]It's going to be carnage.
[208:50.41]Alright, rematch.
[208:51.99]This is for two grand.
[208:56.45]Alright.
[208:57.23]I can do this as long as I can get the hits.
[209:05.50]I can't believe that, yeah, I can't believe Capella lost that.
[209:07.48]I just have to get lucky here.
[209:12.20]Capella's stats are so much better than mine in every conceivable way.
[209:16.54]I have to get lucky.
[209:23.51]Alright.
[209:26.09]Exactly what I wanted to have happen again.
[209:33.53]Do it again.
[209:34.11]Again, again, again, again.
[209:34.81]60% chance getting close.
[209:37.31]41.
[209:38.17]Don't do the cube!
[209:54.10]I'll just stay back.
[209:54.82]Whatever.
[210:00.50]I'm just gonna play like a coward.
[210:01.52]This is for the championship.
[210:03.40]Well, the money.
[210:07.92]Oh my god, that hurts so much!
[210:23.41]That was so stupid!
[210:24.63]He couldn't even move!
[210:43.89]God damn it.
[210:49.11]At least I get to make the Errantry money back.
[211:07.61]Okay.
[211:08.47]Alright, not terrible.
[211:10.61]I gotta get that over 200 power and then I'm setting an Errantry again.
[211:16.86]You did a good job.
[211:17.46]You're okay.
[211:21.68]Is it half off air entry?
[211:28.18]Tablets.
[211:33.76]Did you do Tommy Lee Jones?
[211:35.10]Yeah, I'll try.
[211:36.90]Okay.
[211:54.65]Is he tired?
[212:03.43]How much is Errantry?
[212:07.12]Stop drugging.
[212:08.84]I'm not.
[212:09.60]It's nutrient pills.
[212:11.94]What the fuck?
[212:19.56]Why are you calling me a druggie?
[212:21.24]Dude, you're a druggie.
[212:22.92]What do you mean a druggie?
[212:29.40]No, the joke there was, why do you want me to do a Tommy Lee Jones impression?
[212:34.06]I can't even tell you the last Tommy Lee Jones movie that I watched.
[212:39.68]Take your vitamins.
[212:40.87]What?
[212:41.09]Alright, we're doing... What's next?
[212:48.05]Thousand bucks?
[212:50.69]Two thousand bucks.
[212:51.77]This is the one we're gonna win.
[212:52.67]And then we're gonna move up to C rank.
[212:58.38]Okay.
[212:59.82]So, how you doing right now?
[213:01.38]Should we do Errantry?
[213:05.96]Come on, you can do it.
[213:11.33]$2,000, dude.
[213:16.87]Is this stupid?
[213:20.01]Go for it.
[213:20.49]Go.
[213:26.60]Do it.
[213:29.14]Let's do it.
[213:40.71]Fire!
[213:50.17]Let's see it.
[214:03.58]Is he gonna die to the sharks again?
[214:04.88]He's better than he was before.
[214:09.12]Clean landing.
[214:12.16]Clean landing.
[214:19.96]I want to play this game so bad now.
[214:21.38]It's really good.
[214:22.14]You get both of them.
[214:24.02]You get one and two.
[214:25.60]This is the big kicker right here.
[214:27.14]Let's get ourselves a new technique.
[214:35.61]Turn around.
[214:38.49]Turn around!
[214:40.99]Whack him!
[214:41.27]You fuckin' idiot.
[214:47.17]Here's another chance.
[214:56.40]This side.
[214:57.02]Come on.
[215:00.12]Do it!
[215:03.55]Turn around!
[215:08.66]Oh my god, why come on you were so close It's too grand he's too young How I only have $1,000 left I'm
[215:47.61]He's got 44 loyalty.
[215:48.87]Alright, rest.
[215:51.43]Take some stress reduction.
[216:03.58]You've spoiled him and you're too hard on him.
[216:06.32]Yeah, how does that make any sense?
[216:20.69]How much for you to stream the thing again?
[216:22.46]I already streamed the whole thing.
[216:23.44]Alright.
[216:31.86]Let's go for it again.
[216:35.56]I need to... I have to make at least a little bit of money.
[216:40.96]This is $2,000.
[216:41.78]Which means if I come in second place, I get $1,000.
[216:48.60]You're going to stop providing your kids with alternative medicine.
[217:04.07]Alright, this is not bad because the big weird dog Muppet thing is not here.
[217:09.29]Alright, come on.
[217:34.66]It's alright.
[217:39.38]Bounce.
[217:39.90]Bounce it.
[217:43.20]Get angry.
[217:43.72]That's good.
[217:44.28]Get angry.
[217:45.00]Use it.
[217:47.34]Will you use your anger?
[217:52.22]Use that anger!
[217:52.94]Dodge it!
[217:59.53]Holy shit, that's so clutch.
[218:00.79]That would have been awful if I got hit by that.
[218:13.21]Dodge it!
[218:26.84]Why are you voting- Why are you rooting against me?
[218:38.86]We can beat this, uh, this little owl thing.
[218:46.65]I beat it last time.
[218:57.40]Staying close.
[218:59.96]Bingo.
[219:00.58]Alright.
[219:00.90]Again?
[219:02.42]68% chance.
[219:03.04]Come on.
[219:06.36]That hurts a lot, but it's not that big of a deal.
[219:08.00]As long as I can spring a few together.
[219:09.10]Your skill is so bad.
[219:09.94]Put him on ice.
[219:10.38]I'm done.
[219:10.62]I'm done with this guy.
[219:12.50]He's getting frozen.
[219:14.97]He heard me say that.
[219:16.99]Now he's going to be hitting way more.
[219:23.39]Go back.
[219:30.88]62% chance you still can't hit him.
[219:34.68]What are you swinging at?
[219:36.66]What are you swinging at?
[219:45.87]Thank you!
[219:46.53]Knock him out.
[219:46.97]That's back-to-back 60%.
[219:54.25]I bet I'm in... 60's really not that high.
[219:57.17]If you want to hit more often, save up your guts.
[220:03.07]The more guts you have in the bank, the more accurate and powerful the move is.
[220:08.21]Yeah, I heard that too, but when... This early, though, I feel like you have to get hits in.
[220:16.63]That might be the complete wrong strategy.
[220:21.47]He moved it?
[220:22.42]Moved it?
[220:28.66]Alright, Capella wins.
[220:30.76]But... I can still come in second place if I beat Winston, who has lost twice.
[220:36.43]I'll get a thousand bucks out of this.
[220:43.40]Stay away from that ice breath move and I will be fine.
[220:47.00]Stay in close.
[220:51.98]That's alright.
[220:52.60]That's fine.
[220:56.36]You weren't just such a dumbass in just every single move.
[220:59.56]You just don't know where you are.
[221:00.48]Again.
[221:06.65]Can we start eating Wheaties for breakfast?
[221:09.31]Why are you... Second place.
[221:11.59]Get it.
[221:43.74]Hit him!
[221:48.38]Fucking swing at him!
[222:04.86]What happened?
[222:06.30]Oh, my controller unplugged.
[222:13.16]That's why I couldn't swing at him.
[222:18.55]That's very interesting.
[222:24.74]Oops.
[222:34.92]I have it plugged into, because this cord is small, so it's plugged into an extender that goes to the computer under there.
[222:41.04]Oops.
[222:44.41]Do I get any money at all?
[222:51.77]Who even won?
[222:52.27]Did I get money for that?
[223:09.65]It's $50?
[223:12.77]That's not even going to cover the expenses that it takes to- That's not even going to cover the medicine to- I gained one fan.
[223:21.68]Oh, that sucks.
[223:23.70]I keep going like this.
[223:28.84]My head's not itchy.
[223:29.76]It's just like a nervous habit.
[223:31.31]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[223:35.45]Did you not learn anything?
[223:42.17]The monkey.
[223:50.49]Seems pretty tired.
[223:51.23]Go ahead and rest.
[223:55.31]Is it time to go take a look for another monster?
[223:57.11]If you consider dandruff shampoo, my head's fine.
[224:02.20]It's not itchy.
[224:02.78]I'm just like, my fingers need somewhere to go.
[224:06.58]Whenever I'm sitting around, if I'm doing something that I'm really interested in and really intensely focused on, my hand will just have a mind of its own and just go and move to different places and move around.
[224:21.45]I'm not in control of his hand.
[224:22.99]It's just like... Just like up here.
[224:33.75]ADHD, yeah.
[224:34.95]I mean, that's probably what it is.
[224:37.71]You're a fidgeter.
[224:38.47]I am a big fidgeter, you're right.
[224:39.77]Told you.
[224:41.87]Alright, he's almost a year old.
[224:48.90]Let's get some training here, please.
[224:54.48]Vigorous training.
[224:57.42]I'm doing the powerful drill with doing skill.
[225:04.21]There's nothing that's powerful skill, is there?
[225:08.74]Speed, power, intelligence, and defense.
[225:12.37]This one, but I don't want intelligence.
[225:14.69]Power.
[225:16.77]Power.
[225:17.03]Go.
[225:46.26]I need money bad.
[225:51.50]Can you please... Who is it?
[225:56.35]It's going to be Errantree, isn't it?
[226:00.63]I wasted... Last month I did this and wasted money.
[226:03.31]It's Errantree.
[226:04.17]God damn it.
[226:06.80]Crap.
[226:23.82]This is a thousand bucks.
[226:24.64]I'm just gonna go here and just win.
[226:28.50]Rest.
[226:30.60]I need that thousand dollars.
[226:31.56]We're gonna go.
[226:31.90]We're gonna drop down a rank and just kill people.
[226:43.77]Smurf.
[226:47.79]This monster is miserable.
[226:49.03]He's not even miserable.
[227:01.65]Combine this guy with Bonnie.
[227:03.47]I'm scared to do that, because what if we get a shitty combination?
[227:11.58]How much can you sell?
[227:12.20]Yeah, you know what?
[227:12.66]Let's find out how much I can sell.
[227:22.71]Welcome.
[227:23.09]Okay, what would you like to do?
[227:25.63]Sell.
[227:25.81]Sell.
[227:27.93]You pay 100 gold for your monster.
[227:29.73]What the f- What a lowball offer that is.
[227:32.65]100 gold?
[227:36.44]That's... That's nothing.
[227:40.82]Give me a break.
[227:41.56]Alright, back to the ranch.
[227:47.80]I'm giving this guy one more opportunity.
[227:50.59]We're gonna take him.
[227:52.29]We're gonna do Errantry.
[227:55.39]First, we're gonna drill.
[228:04.42]I'm gonna do the easy tournament and just try to get some money.
[228:14.62]Be glad she's paying anything for something so worthless.
[228:19.91]Skill is actually increasing.
[228:26.03]What is that one?
[228:26.57]Alright, let's go.
[228:28.39]Let's just go wipe the floor with a bunch of fucking low-level smurfs.
[228:32.95]Wait, what did that say?
[228:38.34]Do I care?
[228:38.82]I don't know if I care.
[228:42.63]I'm gonna lose subs for this.
[228:59.44]Monster pups cup?
[229:03.54]I'm fighting actually literally children.
[229:11.21]That had like a little cartoon children's intro.
[229:15.89]Okay.
[229:21.07]How much fame do I lose?
[229:22.09]They have better stats than I do!
[229:25.61]How am I gonna lose fame?
[229:29.23]Why are you still doing an E rank?
[229:45.05]Dude, this character is E-Rank.
[229:46.83]I can't hit anybody.
[229:49.55]I've been hammering skill for the last like three months and I can't even hit anybody.
[229:59.65]I'm not losing to children yet, okay?
[230:01.57]I'm losing slightly to children.
[230:06.51]Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna lose.
[230:11.71]Dodge something!
[230:16.17]Dodge it.
[230:26.02]There it is.
[230:26.52]Percentages I win.
[230:27.90]Thank you.
[230:43.72]You guys are betting on every single match?
[230:52.26]I wonder how many guys are just losing over and over again.
[230:58.77]This one should be easy.
[231:03.41]Yeah, I got this.
[231:09.45]Let's build some guts up.
[231:10.35]Let's try that strategy because right now it's like a 40% chance to hit.
[231:17.91]But I don't just want to farm Guts while he beats the shit out of me.
[231:21.86]Still at... Okay, we're at 80 Guts.
[231:25.60]We're at a 4... That doesn't seem like that... We're at almost 100 Guts.
[231:29.26]I'm not sure it's worth doing that.
[231:38.43]I gotta hit him.
[231:38.89]That was big.
[231:42.33]If you bet against this, I don't know what the hell you were doing.
[231:48.56]It's alright.
[231:51.64]Done.
[232:04.18]Is the equivalent of sending an 11-year-old to a kindergarten karate tournament and not being sure about the win?
[232:13.09]Well, I'm pretty sure of it now unless the bunny... If the bunny loses here, it's over.
[232:18.66]That's it.
[232:19.84]I'll take the victory.
[232:23.58]Wait.
[232:24.46]No, this is the victory.
[232:25.36]I have to win this.
[232:28.96]This bunny had 50 health.
[232:30.93]It's going to be so simple.
[232:31.93]Don't worry.
[232:35.43]Yeah, I'm going to... If you bet against this, I want to bet for me right now.
[232:48.89]Staying close.
[232:52.21]The rabbit has no moves up close.
[233:00.13]I can just try to keep the zone here.
[233:03.96]And let's go for it again.
[233:13.16]Stay in there.
[233:14.48]Stay in there.
[233:15.08]Don't let him close the gap.
[233:18.33]Yeah, let's get him.
[233:19.33]What are you thinking?
[233:24.49]Wrapped and clapped.
[233:34.31]Okay, and try to kill him.
[233:38.41]Alright, that's a thousand bucks.
[233:46.50]And an item, too.
[233:48.04]I think the little disc chips, when you combine monsters, you use a disc chip and it adds stats, I think.
[233:57.01]I'm pretty sure.
[233:57.45]What do you think?
[234:06.90]We have to wait until I can at least get this guy another skill.
[234:11.54]He's winning tournaments.
[234:21.79]Disc chips.
[234:28.21]And... Ooh.
[234:35.56]Learned something too.
[234:36.16]Alright.
[234:38.46]I need to get the 200 power.
[234:45.53]Let's praise him.
[234:46.21]Okay, make sure to blink.
[234:59.26]Alright, we're getting there.
[235:11.01]It's almost time.
[235:14.64]Give the banana.
[235:15.28]Alright, it's banana time.
[235:19.20]I don't even know what this does.
[235:23.70]Eat the banana.
[235:24.10]What did that do?
[235:35.14]What did that do?
[235:41.49]It didn't do anything.
[235:45.68]Loyalty went down.
[235:46.66]What?
[235:54.61]Banana trades fatigue for lifespan.
[236:00.41]Did I just make him die faster?
[236:02.85]That's not good.
[236:06.97]Crap.
[236:08.35]Crap.
[236:14.88]Alright, go learn another move.
[236:22.92]Power to 200.
[236:25.28]He's got to learn another move.
[236:31.78]Get rid of him.
[236:38.95]He's a loss.
[236:40.61]I don't think so yet.
[236:43.19]We got two of these now.
[236:54.82]Okay.
[236:57.72]Errantry.
[236:58.24]How much does it cost?
[236:59.98]It's 2,000.
[237:01.30]Wait, no it's not.
[237:02.04]It's 1,000.
[237:03.90]Come on, dude.
[237:06.23]What?
[237:06.47]It went back.
[237:07.01]I thought it was still... Oh, it's a different month.
[237:08.47]Okay.
[237:18.12]One Monster Andy.
[237:19.46]I need to get somebody up to at least a year.
[237:28.21]Level up.
[237:29.05]Power.
[237:30.01]Thank you.
[237:36.38]When is this battle?
[237:39.74]Should I go for C?
[237:48.62]No, not yet.
[237:56.90]I want to participate in an attorney and fight next week.
[237:59.11]What do you mean next week?
[238:02.71]There's no fight next week.
[238:07.99]Is there?
[238:12.91]Yes.
[238:16.91]I don't remember there being one.
[238:21.05]No, there's none.
[238:21.85]Sorry, you can't.
[238:22.50]157.
[238:22.52]I think it's time that I go power.
[238:49.70]I'm not doing enough damage to people.
[238:51.18]Power again.
[238:54.79]Someone does over 50 a hit and complains about damage.
[239:19.74]Oh, he's kind of tired.
[239:23.15]Alright, let's do it.
[239:24.25]Rank D. Yeah, rank D. I should just wait and take him to F. What do you guys think?
[239:37.54]I will get crushed in C.
[239:53.61]He needs to get older.
[239:54.27]He needs to actually go into the, like, adolescent stage, which is between, what, one and two years?
[240:07.80]Alright.
[240:09.10]We have not seen one of these people yet.
[240:17.62]Just, yep, stay in close.
[240:19.58]Don't get hit by the ice ball.
[240:20.88]And kill.
[240:24.39]That was very, very good.
[240:25.83]Now just hold it together.
[240:29.13]Don't be too crazy.
[240:30.03]Let the guts build up.
[240:34.11]Good.
[240:34.37]Go for it.
[240:38.84]Clean.
[240:40.62]Very clean.
[240:45.54]Don't be an idiot.
[241:01.38]Do not choke on Capella.
[241:03.66]I... I'm going to try to play it safe.
[241:16.05]Capella, lose.
[241:18.75]Nice.
[241:24.55]Hailfall?
[241:28.00]Okay, I- Millium has 40 health.
[241:33.47]Let's do it.
[241:33.81]When are you going to peep the horror?
[241:40.87]When is the game- When is he gonna pee- I don't know what that means.
[241:42.95]Alright, stay in close.
[241:55.98]Build up the guts.
[242:01.80]Come on, really?
[242:03.80]Combo again.
[242:08.23]Shit.
[242:27.59]Good.
[242:28.73]Alright, now don't be moron.
[242:30.99]Don't be moron.
[242:34.38]Go back.
[242:34.76]Alright, can I swing once?
[242:47.17]Get in there.
[242:51.37]Alright, I win.
[242:59.76]Hopefully I gain the fame back if I win.
[243:01.26]Joe Biden called me cringe in his latest appearance.
[243:18.75]That guy is just so cringe.
[243:20.69]By executive order, I'm going to make it so it's illegal for him to stream.
[243:24.70]He's the cringiest damn guy I've ever seen.
[243:28.36]Imagine if I had something like a president-like executive order for me to not stream.
[243:33.26]What would I even do?
[243:37.48]It's a cringe tax.
[243:42.73]I have to pay a cringe tax.
[243:45.47]I have to pay an extra 10% of my income to the cringe tax.
[243:50.57]That's so stupid.
[243:51.51]Alright, this guy lost twice.
[244:03.29]I can handle it.
[244:07.05]Getting close.
[244:09.67]That thing's cool looking though.
[244:21.36]Don't get stabbed.
[244:22.82]I feel like that thing hurts.
[244:32.05]Getting really greedy here, but... Ugh!
[244:57.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[244:59.58]Hit him, hit him, hit him, hit him.
[245:07.61]Okay, time's up.
[245:09.16]That was close.
[245:16.58]Is this for GameCube?
[245:17.44]This is for Steam and Switch right now.
[245:19.87]You can get it right now.
[245:20.67]It's a double bundled Monster Rancher 1 and 2.
[245:24.43]It's a doozy.
[245:37.48]Explain how Millium is winning.
[245:39.44]Any matches.
[245:54.63]Alright, let's take it home.
[246:04.83]That intelligence is so high.
[246:08.07]Get in close.
[246:08.71]Holy shit, you actually got it off.
[246:12.27]It's okay.
[246:18.88]Doesn't matter.
[246:19.40]Your moves are so bad, just don't let her get any range.
[246:24.12]I can take six damage a thousand times.
[246:25.71]Doesn't matter.
[246:26.03]Build the guts up.
[246:26.63]I used it to punch her once in the face.
[246:36.15]Oh, you motherfucker, please.
[246:54.59]Oh, I got her.
[246:57.65]So that's definitely how she's winning matches.
[247:01.17]She's ranging.
[247:02.25]I'm just trying to stay back.
[247:03.77]I'm just winning by countdown.
[247:11.41]Alright, it's now impossible for me to lose.
[247:18.25]Actually not possible to lose now.
[247:20.01]Tournament won.
[247:27.38]Oh, make sure you tune in tomorrow for the Game Awards.
[247:29.84]I'll be live during the Game Awards.
[247:32.58]And then after the Game Awards, I'm probably going to play this again.
[247:35.87]Because I want to play it again.
[247:43.31]This one's just for fun.
[247:49.50]What time is the Game Awards?
[247:50.36]4.30 Pacific?
[247:57.52]3 o'clock Pacific maybe?
[247:58.28]4 o'clock Pacific?
[247:59.46]Maybe 5?
[248:08.99]I can lose this fight.
[248:09.67]It's okay.
[248:18.63]Combo.
[248:20.47]Combo again.
[248:22.07]Combo again.
[248:22.79]Knockout.
[248:23.11]Alright, this is a win.
[248:34.56]Stay back.
[248:35.56]Watch that stupid thing.
[248:37.20]I could really get carried away here and die.
[248:53.33]Yes!
[248:56.27]Nice.
[249:14.11]Perfect score.
[249:14.97]I'll take it.
[249:15.33]I should get a lot of fame for this then.
[249:20.27]At least 5 to 10 fame, I hope.
[249:25.97]These mobile controls look like ass.
[249:30.28]I would imagine this actually would be terrible with a mouse.
[249:33.44]I mean, maybe you do left and right on the arrow keys or W-A-A.
[249:38.84]It feels a little weird.
[249:40.54]With a controller, this is fine.
[249:48.25]It plays just like it did 20 years ago.
[249:54.99]drop the source yeah there's gonna be black bars right wow that's pretty huge wow that's actually a big deal nice I know I can't freeze them because now his stats are gonna be really good soon

[250:29.84]It's all that kind of random.
[250:35.22]Is this emulated?

[251:11.56]Second rank.

[251:50.16]Are you from a different planet?
[251:57.54]Imagine trying to search in your head for a song to sing someone on a happy birthday.
[252:02.44]On somebody's birthday.

[253:12.74]I'm doing heavy training with power.
[253:13.98]I'm curious.
[253:14.74]I think it's going to be alright.
[253:15.98]Go for it.
[253:18.18]Make it happen.
[253:24.20]Get up there!

[254:16.44]Big increases now.
[254:17.86]Huge increases.
[254:24.67]That's like, that's a lot.
[254:27.17]I'm gonna keep doing it.
[254:42.82]What is this peak the horror thing?
[254:44.12]I don't even know what that is.
[254:48.34]Oh, again.
[254:48.84]Another 20 stats.
[255:04.96]Well, technically did it.
[255:12.78]That was cheeky.
[255:16.47]Food, we're gonna do a cup of jelly.
[255:19.55]Stress reducer.
[255:26.26]It's a reference to a dream someone had about you it blew up on Tumblr.
[255:30.00]What?
[255:32.37]It's a dream someone had about you.
[255:34.07]There's a comic book about it.
[255:46.52]What?
[255:52.84]I need to buy some more mint leaves.
[255:56.73]Read the comic.
[256:06.81]What?
[256:07.13]Okay, um... Can I just read this?
[256:20.01]Okay.
[256:31.66]I'm just gonna read this.
[256:32.69]Had a dream last night Jerma became like a mainstream celebrity by pioneering a new type of stream where he would play a game like normal but every once in a while he would let chat peep the horror and put this like red and black pulsating mass on screen.
[256:50.98]It kinda looked like an AI-generated image.
[256:53.62]And the whole deal was that everyone who saw it thought it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen, but every time he'd show it, one viewer who saw it would die.
[257:04.65]It ended when he showed it on stream and dropped dead.
[257:08.03]The stream was left on for 72 hours to honor his memory.
[257:14.73]It was dead quiet with just his body and a slowly pulsating red mass on screen beside him.
[257:25.26]What?
[257:26.46]That's fucked up.
[257:32.66]Whoa.
[257:39.35]That's what it looks like?
[257:40.43]Hold on.
[257:45.30]That's so scary.
[257:48.31]But I'm the one that died?
[257:49.67]Not lucky, man.
[257:54.77]What's with that RNG?
[258:09.98]Oh, Popeye's fries!
[258:19.70]No, don't show that that's that's it.

[274:21.64]I don't think I can do this.
[274:23.56]I shouldn't be here.
[274:24.32]Vordorf had a splendid victory.
[274:29.60]Boatwreck and Epsilon.
[274:31.16]These are rare, scary monsters.
[274:34.21]I'm gonna die.
[274:38.47]Bug, Batman vs. Kitty.
[274:39.98]Should I just leave?
[274:41.66]Should I just walk out?
[274:55.03]Um...
[275:10.96]Uh, maybe we should watch from the stands the rest of this.

[275:49.66]What do I care?
[275:55.64]The final.
[275:57.20]Bowtrek versus Kitty.
[275:58.28]I mean, Kitty did 300 damage to me.
[276:01.43]I'm glad I didn't fight that guy.
[276:06.27]Alright, did I get any money?
[276:07.13]I mean, I was like an extra.

[276:45.24]I need to make money.
[276:49.94]I'm going to freeze him and I'm going to go see if I can get toxic.
[276:54.34]I don't think you can.
[276:55.16]I think I have to be like rank A to do it.
[277:04.81]Alright, let's try it.
[277:05.69]I'm going to try it.
[277:13.27]Put him on ice.

[277:33.06]What does it take to combine?
[277:36.68]Combine.
[277:38.56]500 gold to combine.
[277:40.56]I'm going to cheat here.
[277:44.54]How do I save the game manually?
[277:50.08]I'm just cheating.
[278:02.52]I want to see what we get.
[278:03.62]I'm curious.
[278:05.77]500 gold.
[278:07.73]And we're doing Bonnie and Bug Batman?
[278:16.06]Okay.
[278:18.38]Combine with you.
[278:25.60]What do I get?
[278:27.54]Let's use an item as seasoning, yes?
[278:32.18]Just chips.
[278:35.94]Seasoning?
[278:38.01]This can be used as a secret seasoning.
[278:43.81]Alright, should we proceed?
[278:51.02]So there's a 31% chance we get a Kabalos.
[278:55.49]What's Terror Dog?
[278:58.19]Blue Spon- That's only 5% chance.
[278:59.35]Crimson-Eyed... Blue Sponge.

[279:51.73]20% chance for a Ripper.
[279:53.23]Allure.
[279:55.94]Azula.
[279:59.66]Ivory Wall.
[280:02.62]Ripper.
[280:08.62]Let's see these two.
[280:22.61]Gatton?
[280:23.99]Or Mint?
[280:29.01]A Dayton?

[280:41.16]Allure.
[280:41.50]Allure.
[280:58.45]Into the trash.
[281:11.71]I don't want this.
[281:33.64]It's like it never happened.
[281:36.26]Okay.
[281:39.04]Let's just see if we can get something else interesting.
[281:44.36]I don't think I can get toxic.
[281:45.85]I think you have to be rank A. Yeah.
[281:54.73]Rare monsters can only be... I gotta be rank B or A.
[282:05.97]Any other songs that you want me to try before I pull out, um... Who should I play with?
[282:11.92]I think I'm gonna keep going with the, um... SpongeBob?
[282:21.66]SpongeBob SquarePants?
[282:25.13]Super Sponge?
[282:28.99]SpongeBob SquarePants Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[282:33.35]Oh, it's the actual game disc.
[282:36.47]Rehydrated?
[282:37.55]Let's go.
[282:40.05]Come on.
[282:41.17]It's rare.
[282:42.37]Remember that.
[282:54.84]SpongeBob SquarePants.
[282:57.12]SpongeBob theme song.
[282:59.72]Metal version.
[283:02.96]Stop being rare!
[283:04.12]That's annoying.
[283:13.59]What about Undertale?
[283:16.47]Undertale.
[283:17.90]Undertale soundtrack.
[283:29.87]I gotta win a rank B match.
[283:31.91]That's the only way I can do it.
[283:43.70]There's nothing for The Simpsons, really?
[283:48.34]Limp Bizkit.
[283:49.26]Wrong.
[283:57.33]Uh, okay.

[284:03.01]Give us something.
[284:03.69]Not this bullshit.
[284:04.73]It would have to be rank A.
[284:18.13]It's a piece of granite.
[284:24.05]Funny looking monster.
[284:24.99]This thing is stupid.
[284:29.44]I'll freeze it.
[284:46.77]What did I... I got one of these before.
[284:48.09]What did I call it?
[284:54.63]It's just a wall again.
[284:55.97]Yeah.
[284:58.03]Call it Roblox.
[285:00.91]Well, Sweet Rind was not... Sweet Rind was like a watermelon, wasn't it?
[285:04.46]Call it the Xbox Series X.
[285:26.29]Where's space?
[285:32.92]No, no, I can't do a space.
[286:00.69]Freeze this motherfucker immediately.

[287:11.69]We're not good enough to open these.
[287:16.61]Crazy Frog.
[287:17.27]We already looked for Crazy Frog.
[287:20.19]Oasis.
[287:20.79]Wonderwall.
[287:34.30]Everything is rare!
[287:47.13]Dragon Ball.
[287:49.89]I've seen too many names.
[287:51.07]Celine Dion?
[287:56.65]Really?
[288:01.19]What?
[288:03.91]Oh, it's Celine Dion, not here.
[288:09.92]Aerosmith.
[288:17.17]Aerosmith's greatest hits.
[288:18.63]Alright, I'm just going to go win tournaments because this is stupid.
[288:24.99]I want one more.
[288:34.40]Halo?
[288:38.16]Halo 4.
[288:41.76]Halo... Halo 4's original soundtrack.
[288:49.65]Finally, we get to see a goddamn monster.
[289:02.20]Alright, I'm interested.
[289:04.18]I'm very interested.
[289:12.19]Looks dependable.
[289:21.29]That's a high defense.
[289:24.43]Alright.
[289:30.32]Those are good.
[289:33.70]It's kind of like a crab.
[289:35.36]A crab scorpion.
[289:39.22]Crab skipping.
[289:41.46]Crab skipping.
[289:42.73]Crab scorpion.
[289:43.59]Crab scorpion.
[289:47.41]Master chef.
[289:52.24]What are you doing?
[289:52.62]What are you doing?
[289:54.77]No, stop it.
[289:57.91]What'd you say?
[289:58.33]What?
[289:59.37]Stop it.
[289:59.69]Uh... Wellington?
[290:07.95]Actually, I kind of like that.
[290:20.74]I like it.
[290:24.45]What is this?
[290:25.13]Is it a combination?
[290:26.05]Or is this just a straight up crab thing?
[290:34.38]Let's take it.
[290:42.28]Why does he pick the worst one?
[290:44.28]Well, how is it the worst one?
[290:45.36]That's Wellington.
[290:46.40]I like it.
[290:46.80]Alright.
[290:48.20]I need to know a lot about you.
[290:49.48]Who are you?
[290:53.56]Alright, you got pretty good skill already.
[290:55.28]Power is really good already.
[290:59.42]You don't like cup jelly.
[291:01.12]You like battling.
[291:02.16]That's kind of unfortunate.
[291:04.66]Punch and claw assault.
[291:09.84]This is really good hit percentage.
[291:11.10]The force is bad on both these, though.
[291:15.76]Bad scaling, but at least you'll hit.
[291:25.85]Wellington is not a crab.
[291:37.22]And now you want me to freeze him after that?
[291:38.96]After that shit?
[291:40.12]Are you serious?
[291:42.86]What do we need?
[291:43.60]Power?
[291:43.92]I'm going to say power.
[291:47.16]Intelligence is definitely not intelligence.
[291:48.97]It's power and maybe speed.
[291:52.19]Power and defense?
[291:59.49]Alright, go for it.
[292:00.13]Let's see what you got.
[292:00.83]Right off the bat.
[292:05.82]Eh, it's alright.
[292:07.04]You're a baby.
[292:07.94]You just figured it out.
[292:08.58]It's okay.
[292:12.00]It's okay.
[292:12.44]Don't worry.
[292:12.94]No, you're fine.
[292:13.58]It's alright.
[292:13.90]It's alright.
[292:16.38]Everything's fine.
[292:24.05]I do want to buy more of those stress things.
[292:34.74]I need mint leaves.
[292:36.83]Somebody has to win a fight.
[292:38.75]I'm going to lose all my money.
[292:49.25]I need to take him to a tournament and just win.
[292:51.39]This is going to be bad.
[292:53.39]Okay.
[292:55.27]No more.
[292:55.59]Stop spending.
[292:56.07]That was so cute.
[293:01.37]I love him.
[293:12.48]I don't know.
[293:14.42]Alright.
[293:16.68]Get some more power.
[293:19.73]Just enough to win a tournament.
[293:25.29]Got it, right?
[293:25.77]Nice.
[293:26.23]Good job.
[293:31.87]Level up.
[293:32.71]Perfect.
[293:38.02]Uh-oh, Jax.
[293:38.44]You're running out of money.
[293:40.02]You better enter Wellington into a tournament to make some bucks.
[293:48.95]Let's go.
[293:49.57]Let's go.
[293:50.01]Let's go.
[293:50.37]Right now.
[293:57.19]He's going to do the voice every time he says it, isn't he?
[294:00.02]What are you doing?
[294:03.96]No, stop.
[294:05.57]I just have to say a few things.
[294:07.65]Stop.
[294:08.15]I love that.
[294:08.63]It's like my favorite thing about him.
[294:10.79]He's standing there like this.
[294:11.55]And he goes like this.
[294:13.52]He goes...
[294:31.19]Yeah, I got pants on I have pants on A top half of your head was gone
[295:02.73]You're gaslighting us.
[295:04.15]Watch anything that Gordon Ramsay's ever done.
[295:06.09]He goes like up on his heels.
[295:08.41]Like he goes on his toes.
[295:10.17]And he puts his hands up like this.
[295:12.01]And he goes like up, down, up, up, down.
[295:17.84]I'm serious.
[295:19.52]I love it.
[295:20.20]I think he has some amazing mannerisms.
[295:24.84]Alright, let's kick some ass.
[295:26.84]He does the orangutan.
[295:29.24]Oh, delicious.
[295:30.38]Absolutely delicious.
[295:32.23]No, in the pan.
[295:33.87]Did you put it in the pan?
[295:39.22]I'm so sorry, fucking idiot.
[295:45.38]Oh no, Oakley man is back.
[295:47.32]This is not good.
[295:58.85]New animated emote.
[296:02.17]I actually might be okay.
[296:08.78]Damn, that's good.
[296:10.36]We're about close.
[296:18.43]Not bad.
[296:24.51]That hits for a pretty good amount.
[296:33.04]Good job.
[296:35.08]Get back.
[296:43.74]Watch out the guts here.
[296:45.64]I get hit like two or three times and it's over.
[296:47.76]Holy fucking shit, dude.
[296:49.64]Give me a break.
[296:51.00]Wow.
[296:52.76]That was unbelievable.
[296:55.32]That just did so much fucking damage.
[296:57.18]What a joke.
[296:58.18]What a joke.
[297:25.21]80.
[297:25.61]He did almost 80 damage to me in one hit.
[297:30.04]Ellington picked up the victory by default.
[297:33.04]Why?
[297:36.28]What?
[297:39.76]This is still winnable.
[297:40.46]I just have to beat Leon.
[297:54.33]This should be a win.
[298:00.53]Back to back.
[298:06.63]Good.
[298:09.57]Back it up.
[298:11.53]No, come on.
[298:12.45]I couldn't hit it.
[298:30.44]Alright, go on.
[298:31.13]How many coin flips am I going to lose in a row?
[298:39.10]Alright.
[298:42.34]Kill this motherfucker.
[298:43.16]I just played safe.
[298:45.84]I don't want to get hit.
[298:47.51]Alright, let's go.
[299:04.64]to end it.
[299:07.64]Damn it.
[299:10.28]I don't think I can beat Oakley, man.
[299:19.54]Okay.
[299:22.95]What keeps happening to Oakley, man?
[299:24.23]He's always... I can do this.
[299:28.51]Let's go.
[299:33.99]Started early.
[299:34.55]Alright, stop going for the big hit and just land the ones that have higher percentage.
[299:54.30]I'm not taking my own advice.
[299:55.42]I don't know what I'm doing.
[299:58.66]78% he just gets confused.
[300:01.30]Come on, man.
[300:04.22]Thank you.
[300:07.02]He's got 99 guts.
[300:10.72]Why won't you swing?
[300:11.62]You make me look bad.
[300:17.62]I gotta do something.
[300:18.26]This is literally 10 seconds.
[300:19.48]I fucking hit him.
[300:21.01]Swing at him.
[300:22.41]I'm just trapped in this stupid.
[300:24.27]He's zoning the fuck out of me, dude.
[300:25.85]Come on.
[300:36.02]That was stupid.
[300:37.08]I couldn't go left and I couldn't go right.
[300:53.93]Yeah, yeah, cool.
[300:55.63]Excellent.
[301:01.26]At least I have enough to not... I could go bankrupt again.
[301:07.49]Congrats to the guy that just won 800,000 points.
[301:08.81]Are you serious?
[301:10.69]Jeez.
[301:14.69]Did you actually learn something?
[301:15.63]Okay, that's good.
[301:22.05]It's your first tournament.
[301:22.93]You almost won, too.
[301:23.85]It's just... It's like just to flip a goddamn coin if you'll hit somebody or not.
[301:29.84]Isn't this guy's skill high?
[301:32.34]What's the problem here?
[301:35.57]You got 150 skill at rank E. What's the problem?
[301:38.53]What's your problem?
[301:40.72]What's your problem?
[301:41.38]I don't understand.
[301:42.42]What's your problem?
[301:46.95]Uh, you can rest.
[302:05.14]He doesn't like cup jelly, right?
[302:06.76]Which is not good, because that's the thing that lowers stress.
[302:10.52]Um, I don't want any tablets.
[302:12.13]That's way too expensive.
[302:15.09]What did he like?
[302:17.43]Milk?
[302:18.31]Fish?
[302:24.59]Maybe milk?
[302:25.49]Nutritious milk?
[302:29.27]Oh, he likes battling, so he doesn't have a preference.
[302:31.13]Alright, if you don't have a preference, then I'm just going to give you fish.
[302:39.42]Alright, it's that time of the day.
[302:42.83]Every... Doesn't matter what it is, whatever I see first in the chat is gonna be what I order for food.
[302:50.25]Here we go.
[302:50.51]Okay.
[303:00.48]Alright.
[303:05.19]You have new mail.
[303:06.45]It's gonna be Errantry, isn't it?
[303:08.67]Alright, if it's Errantry, then I'm gonna go freeze him and go use the other guy.
[303:12.13]It is.
[303:12.39]Alright.
[303:12.87]Alright.
[303:13.41]Fuck this.
[303:13.75]How much money do I have?
[303:21.02]Alright, there's a D-rank battle right now.
[303:23.32]I'm gonna go freeze him.
[303:24.26]I'm gonna bring out... I don't even remember that name.
[303:28.20]It was the snake.
[303:29.14]I'm gonna win this tournament, and then I'm gonna... He has to learn.
[303:32.66]I gotta go freeze Wellington.
[303:34.17]Frozen Wellington.
[303:36.65]Disgusting.
[303:38.29]Really?
[303:39.41]Raw.
[303:40.55]Frozen Wellington.
[303:41.43]You know, I have to get rid of him because I'm not going to stop doing that.
[303:44.71]So I would, I probably should just freeze him.
[303:55.75]Frozen Wellington.
[303:58.31]Alright.
[304:00.75]No more fucking around.
[304:02.38]I got to go win the tournament and then do Errantry with that snake guy.
[304:11.14]Wake up, bug Batman.
[304:12.31]Get out here.
[304:18.47]What you doing?
[304:19.21]No, stop.
[304:19.85]What you doing?
[304:21.81]Leave me alone.
[304:22.65]You're going to fuck me up.
[304:23.51]I'm going to have to say it a hundred times.
[304:35.12]Shit, he's so tired.
[304:36.30]When's the next battle?
[304:39.24]Alright.
[304:42.51]I have an idea.
[304:47.31]Take this, and then fight.
[304:49.97]You're definitely strong enough to do a D-Cup.
[304:52.61]Please.
[304:57.47]Win me this money.
[304:58.19]2,000 bucks.
[304:58.87]And then we're going to let you rest a few days, and then we're going to send you on a trip.
[305:13.75]Go for it.
[305:20.63]Only four contestants.
[305:22.11]It's not a big deal.
[305:23.77]Rank D. It's not going to be hard.
[305:30.52]Oh, it's this motherfucker.
[305:32.08]This guy's going to ruin everything.
[305:34.30]Not Sleep Bomb.
[305:35.80]I have to come in second place.
[305:36.70]This is bad.
[305:47.81]That was just a burn fight.
[305:48.97]He's got so much more health, but his skill and speed are awful.
[305:58.90]I just have to hope he misses over and over again and just try to burn him down.
[306:02.89]Get up close.
[306:06.45]Miss.
[306:36.53]Seventy fucking three percent.
[306:38.07]Get out of town.
[306:56.44]Bash his fucking skull in.
[306:57.54]Hurry up.
[306:58.72]Don't do another move.
[306:59.80]Dodge it.
[307:01.37]Dodge it.
[307:01.75]Dodge it.
[307:02.09]Dodge it.
[307:02.67]Oh, my God.
[307:03.07]I killed him.
[307:04.63]I win.
[307:05.01]Okay.
[307:07.40]That was very, very stressful.
[307:13.72]Don't lose my points.
[307:16.26]I want one of these.
[307:17.26]This thing is so cool.
[307:19.34]I actually want one of these things.
[307:21.04]My webcam needs to be moved.
[307:24.27]It's too big.
[307:25.39]That's better.
[307:31.89]That's better.
[307:35.59]Alright, two grand.
[307:36.49]That was the hardest fight of the whole entire time.
[307:38.85]Come on now.
[307:50.19]Hello, lost.
[307:54.05]Fire.
[308:00.09]The thing that's going to kill me here is the high defense.
[308:06.29]Pretty evenly matched though.
[308:07.29]I got more health.
[308:10.85]Give me a crit.
[308:20.92]Good.
[308:22.44]Good dodges.
[308:23.16]Nice.
[308:23.82]Dodge again.
[308:29.15]I got him in guts.
[308:29.75]I got him.
[308:30.19]I beat him in guts.
[308:39.46]70%, hit it.
[308:41.50]Combo!
[308:58.39]Fuck you!
[309:07.13]Yes!
[309:07.89]Oh, that was so close.
[309:08.89]That would have been really bad if I didn't win this.
[309:10.43]This is gonna save the whole run.
[309:16.14]Nah, I just need Winston to lose.
[309:23.10]Come on, Sleep Bomb.
[309:24.02]Get it.
[309:24.22]This guy, every time... Is it just because he's faster?
[309:38.77]Alright, well, this is it.
[309:42.11]Stay in close.
[309:42.87]Same thing.
[309:43.53]Don't be an idiot.
[309:48.53]I can take the hits.
[309:49.17]It's fine.
[309:49.85]I can hit him harder. 70%.
[310:12.18]Doesn't hurt.
[310:16.88]Two grand.
[310:28.05]Now I can definitely beat C. Get a new move.
[310:33.86]I'll get a bonus.
[310:34.92]I'll get some of the fame back too.
[310:36.52]Which, I lost it all.
[310:51.70]This game sucks and it's even worse if you aren't good at it.
[310:56.92]How do you know this game sucks?
[310:58.92]Did you play it yet?
[311:15.33]He did the thing!
[311:16.33]He did the thing!
[311:22.93]What?!
[311:23.31]That's good.
[311:40.90]Uh, praise.
[311:41.50]If you don't like the game, you don't like the game.
[311:49.25]You want to participate in a tournament and fight?
[311:50.73]You just did.
[311:51.41]That's going to be really... I can't do that.
[311:56.99]You just did one.
[311:57.71]Alright, now we need some real rest.
[312:07.24]This game is one of the best games ever to watch.
[312:20.35]Um, it's whatever, man.
[312:25.39]I knew when this was coming out I was going to play it a lot.
[312:27.99]So this is what we're doing.
[312:29.71]And if people think it's fun, that's awesome because I think it's fun.
[312:34.85]I love this game.
[312:36.69]And we're going to beat this game.
[312:38.75]Not like last time.
[312:39.95]Last time I did B rank and I stopped playing it.
[312:43.92]We're going to beat, we're going to get to at least A to S rank.
[312:47.44]We're going to.
[312:50.83]But, nah, I mean, I was fucking around earlier, right?
[312:53.72]Like, if you don't like the game and you think this sucks, then it's alright.
[312:56.46]It's all good.
[312:57.32]See you next time.
[313:04.22]Alright, so we should go to... Oh... Alright, error entry time.
[313:13.60]Please.
[313:20.46]Skill and life.
[313:26.64]This is gonna be it.
[313:27.42]We're gonna learn a new move.
[313:28.54]Finally.
[313:33.72]You know what?
[313:34.22]Go kill one of these guys, too.
[313:35.49]Like, Norty.
[313:38.73]Go fucking strangle Morty.
[313:41.75]We can handle Morty.
[313:49.77]Come on.
[314:03.87]Good.
[314:04.23]Good start.
[314:05.17]Really good start.
[314:09.77]Plus like 15 or something.
[314:11.23]Plus 20.
[314:11.43]That's alright.
[314:27.82]The shark part, I just have to... I got a skill?
[314:30.48]What?
[314:30.72]I didn't even see it.
[314:33.74]I didn't even see it.
[314:34.22]I got a skill.
[314:36.56]Did I?
[314:37.82]Oh, damn.
[314:38.26]This is awesome.
[314:40.44]Alright, come on.
[314:40.92]Give me over 200 skill.
[314:42.96]I want to fuse this guy with somebody.
[314:47.58]Take out the sharks.
[315:02.66]Yes!
[315:07.06]Come on.
[315:07.80]Keep going.
[315:10.00]This is huge.
[315:10.63]This is the last one.
[315:13.77]Gigantic crab.
[315:19.69]Oh, he got knocked down.
[315:20.61]Is that bad?
[315:27.24]Oh, that's it?
[315:28.20]Did I get it?
[315:33.64]I don't know what counts as a success here.
[315:35.52]What's going on?
[315:38.60]What's happening?
[315:40.46]Did I lose?
[315:43.59]What are you doing?
[315:44.15]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[315:49.15]I wonder how many failure points are here.
[315:51.23]And I think I just did it.
[315:53.99]Fall down.
[315:55.33]One last punch.
[315:59.52]Dude, get him.
[316:03.56]Oh, fuck.
[316:04.98]I don't... This... It's alright.
[316:09.42]There was probably 10 different failure points there.
[316:13.62]It seems pretty strong.
[316:15.64]Praise, praise.
[316:16.54]Let's go take a look.
[316:17.20]I'm really curious.
[316:17.86]Did you just become top tier?
[316:24.78]Alright, come on.
[316:25.35]What do you got?
[316:33.43]Whack and stab.
[316:40.49]Oh, thank God, finally.
[316:45.67]It took long enough.
[316:47.65]Now I can actually hit people without a problem.
[316:54.10]It does withering and sharpness.
[316:57.72]Yeah, we'll keep these two on.
[317:00.14]Thank goodness.
[317:06.74]Excellent.
[317:07.36]Excellent.
[317:07.72]Excellent.
[317:08.05]Excellent.
[317:08.37]Okay.
[317:08.55]There's a C today, but I can't do it.
[317:12.05]We'll try the C one next week.
[317:16.27]So let's go rest.
[317:18.97]Take some nut oil.
[317:20.07]Maybe some stress reduction.
[317:23.45]Keep the horror.
[317:24.35]Sure.
[317:24.53]I'm not doing that ever again.
[317:37.64]I want to get to 200.
[317:41.94]Is it next week?
[317:43.08]It's not.
[317:43.96]Wait, is it next week?
[317:45.62]It's not.
[317:55.89]Good work.
[317:56.21]200, finally.
[318:07.19]I think I'm good for skill for now.
[318:13.12]And we're going to do tablets.
[318:17.50]And see if I can get a little bit more power.
[318:21.52]Yeah, I'm going to do the heavy training, I think, because I need to hit harder.
[318:24.98]Alright, so it's rest.
[318:36.22]Is he ready for sea?
[318:37.38]I don't know.
[318:38.84]I need more speed.
[318:48.37]What kind of monster feeds his pet gummy vitamins for an entire month?
[318:58.61]I just pulled my first monster and all the stats were under 10.
[319:01.28]That sounds awful.
[319:07.13]Let me take a look again.
[319:07.81]I don't think it's enough.
[319:11.67]I think we have to skip this tournament.
[319:16.51]300 power.
[319:17.65]Get back to over 100 speed.
[319:20.21]I need health too.
[319:24.25]Yeah.
[319:24.41]I'm going to have to skip the tournament.
[319:27.97]When's the next one after that?
[319:30.64]Alright, we're going to be ready for the official one.
[319:37.67]So we're going to do some training.
[319:38.81]I want to get... Let's go for the heavy one.
[319:44.75]Come on.
[319:45.13]Don't fail it.
[319:48.97]You can't fight every single week, man.
[319:51.64]You can't fight.
[319:52.34]I keep losing loyalty because he wants to fight every week.
[319:57.14]It's like you have to rest, man.
[319:58.30]Get up there.
[320:01.82]300. 300.
[320:10.99]Close.
[320:14.31]Close.
[320:21.26]Errantry again.
[320:24.30]Look at this.
[320:31.64]It's from Auntie Verde.
[320:33.25]She's having a sale at her shop.
[320:36.25]Oh, that's... Yeah, I need that.
[320:40.19]I use these items all the time.
[320:42.11]How much is it?
[320:42.57]What percentage?
[320:46.83]Great discount.
[320:51.65]Not that much.
[321:00.22]Like... 10% off?
[321:01.22]20% off?
[321:01.36]Whatever.
[321:01.62]I mean, I need them.
[321:02.20]Alright, don't run out of money.
[321:13.99]20%, what's up with that?
[321:15.79]How much can I get for... No, I don't want the chips.
[321:24.58]Okay.
[321:27.16]So... We're going to train... Speed.
[321:38.89]I want to get this back over 100.
[321:43.29]Does that count?
[321:46.07]Truency?
[321:49.11]It's when he took off?
[322:02.51]Rest.
[322:08.23]Your boy is soft.
[322:14.82]Try it again.
[322:20.79]Don't run away this time.
[322:22.39]Nice job.
[322:32.11]Alright.
[322:33.41]Back up to over 100.
[322:34.35]That's good.
[322:36.47]Very important.
[322:39.51]I'm running out of money.
[322:43.03]So we're going to do...
[322:46.27]Mmm, fish?
[322:55.75]Why are you playing with this dingleberry?
[323:00.33]Jelly?
[323:00.56]He doesn't like jelly, but... No, wait, no, he does.
[323:03.50]It's the other one that didn't like it.
[323:08.34]It's going to be a 24-hour stream.
[323:10.14]I don't think that would work, considering I'm streaming the Game Awards tomorrow.
[323:15.32]Only two more of those tops.
[323:18.42]Official tournament.
[323:22.55]Let's see if we can get it.
[323:23.23]How much time do I have?
[323:29.61]Alright, so it's train, train, rest, C. What are we doing here?
[323:37.35]Should I go for some Omega Speed?
[323:46.19]Or dump it into power.
[323:51.85]Health, probably.
[323:52.59]I'll do health.
[323:55.88]Nah, I'll do health.
[323:59.00]It's a good idea.
[324:02.18]Don't cheat.
[324:03.44]You're cheating, but I'm not going to scold you.
[324:32.93]I want to participate in a tournament.
[324:34.17]Yes, you can.
[324:34.93]No, it's not even next week.
[324:36.50]It's the week after.
[324:45.18]Get it up over there.
[324:50.44]No!
[324:50.88]I'm gonna feed him a mango.
[325:21.56]Will that make him happy?
[325:23.82]Yeah, have a mango.
[325:27.52]Maybe that'll make him more loyal.
[325:33.55]Not really.
[325:36.13]Okay, rest up.
[325:38.31]I don't think I'm going to be able to beat this.
[325:39.45]Maybe I'll try one of the lower ones then.
[325:40.65]D rank?
[325:42.83]Or should I try for C rank?
[325:44.03]I need money.
[325:47.50]Ungrateful brick.
[326:01.31]I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[326:13.41]I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[326:19.53]Come on.
[326:20.07]I got over 300 power, 200 skill.
[326:29.94]Sussvane had... Wasn't that bad?
[326:32.70]Okay.
[326:33.40]Huey.
[326:37.42]I got that new move, too.
[326:39.62]Jesus.
[326:40.18]Bro.
[326:46.76]Um.
[326:49.16]What do you have for intelligence moves?
[326:50.58]Do not go anywhere near it.
[326:54.87]Holy shit.
[326:55.65]I can't believe I didn't get hit by Garfield's fucking laser hands.
[326:58.49]Stab him.
[326:59.82]Stab!
[327:07.03]Oh, god damn it!
[327:10.75]Holy shit, do it again!
[327:20.95]Stay in, don't let him push you.
[327:25.41]That move is sick.
[327:28.39]Fuck!
[327:30.25]Don't let him hit you!
[327:30.93]Don't let him push you!
[327:31.51]No!
[327:31.81]Don't get hit by his laser cannon!
[327:53.88]It's alright.
[327:56.20]I can still come in second or third place.
[328:02.15]Suspain didn't even hurt this guy.
[328:12.64]I want, I want one of those.
[328:13.84]I want one of those monkeys.
[328:15.04]Alright.
[328:20.25]Recknen.
[328:25.73]What do you have for stats?
[328:32.61]I'm just barely not good enough for this.
[328:36.69]Defense is terrible though.
[328:37.59]Just got to stay in.
[328:40.87]It's going to just come down to who hits who.
[328:42.31]Because we both have the same amount of skill he has.
[328:43.77]We both have power.
[328:44.59]He's got a little more health.
[328:45.69]Just stay in there and stab him.
[328:52.11]Good dodge.
[328:56.43]Fuck off.
[329:02.28]Fuck you.
[329:03.46]Tails, tails, tails, tails, tails, tails.
[329:08.44]77, you won't swing the bat.
[329:10.39]I'm feeling like a fucking grandpa yelling at a baseball game.
[329:13.59]Swing, hit him.
[329:19.83]Good.
[329:21.72]Get in there.
[329:22.34]Again, stab him.
[329:44.21]Fuck you!
[329:45.19]Hit him!
[329:46.63]Oh my fucking god.
[329:48.49]Every time, it's just... Every time.
[329:56.16]Can I ever get this guy to have more than 47%?
[329:57.92]50%?
[329:58.04]I've been dumping and dumping and dumping and dumping and dumping stats into skill.
[330:06.18]I got over 100 fucking extra points!
[330:22.37]I got to start winning games.
[330:31.20]Actually mad?
[330:32.08]Yeah, I guess I want to win.
[330:33.20]This is the guy that's beating everybody with flawless victories.
[330:41.93]I'm not even going to be able to get one.
[330:45.03]Well, actually, hold on.
[330:51.60]His defense is crazy.
[330:55.39]He's gonna have like a 30% chance to hit and he's just gonna have to hit me one time and I'm dead.
[331:04.23]Good luck.
[331:05.49]Can I dodge?
[331:06.71]My speed's awful.
[331:16.83]What is so confusing?
[331:28.25]No!
[331:31.79]Don't let him swing once.
[331:33.29]Back up!
[331:35.75]Back up!
[331:36.41]Back up!
[331:39.15]Alright, go forward and hit him.
[331:45.81]Back him up!
[331:47.91]Okay, I think I'm alright.
[331:50.81]Run in and stab him.
[331:52.89]Oh my god, how do you miss this?
[331:54.80]It's impossible!
[332:02.32]I'm just holding left.
[332:17.62]Let's go.
[332:18.00]We're good.
[332:20.45]I just can't lose.
[332:31.69]You literally fought a rock.
[332:32.97]Yeah, and he was huge.
[332:37.19]Susvane is losing a lot.
[332:38.77]Yeah, this Huey is going to win.
[332:48.30]He had like eight moves.
[332:49.14]He had this like fire breath.
[332:51.62]He had a laser cannon.
[332:52.64]He had a dashing claws.
[332:54.14]I don't know.
[332:54.72]He was all over the place.
[332:57.81]Alright, this is the monkey.
[333:02.05]I am very scared.
[333:04.11]As I should be.
[333:06.95]I don't see how I win here.
[333:16.13]But good lucky.
[333:19.21]Nice.
[333:22.18]Alright.
[333:22.66]Alright.
[333:23.46]Alright.
[333:27.50]Hold off on the guts.
[333:28.20]Alright.
[333:28.36]60%.
[333:28.38]Keep it going.
[333:39.80]Don't let him get near you.
[333:44.70]He is out of guts though.
[333:46.02]Four guts, you shitting me?
[333:47.20]Just string it together.
[333:48.16]He can't do anything.
[333:51.36]Again, again, again, again, again.
[333:52.81]He can't do anything.
[333:53.73]He has no mana.
[333:59.19]Dodge!
[334:03.97]What is so confusing?
[334:09.77]What are you doing in my Wellington?
[334:11.09]Come on!
[334:11.61]Got him.
[334:25.72]Why are you guys saying Trump?
[334:32.28]Did I sound like Trump?
[334:35.46]What?
[334:42.49]I am actually still in this if I don't lose another one.
[334:58.30]Oh shit, he lost.
[334:59.08]Good.
[335:05.43]OK.
[335:12.11]This should be a pretty decent victory.
[335:14.45]This should be easy.
[335:16.00]He's a loss three times.
[335:20.32]Trump voice.
[335:20.88]I need to hear this.
[335:21.68]I want to know what you're talking about.
[335:35.05]Why did I say that?
[335:45.19]What was that for?
[335:48.15]Okay, let's go.
[335:48.69]I think this guy's intelligence.
[335:53.69]I don't know how this person has lost three times.
[335:57.71]Bad defense, but everything else is really good.
[335:59.57]Even the power.
[336:00.07]Alright, well, do not stay in range of any green attacks.
[336:03.72]So get the fuck in close now.
[336:11.30]Alright.
[336:16.33]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[336:18.40]Okay, okay, just hit him one more time.
[336:20.82]Watch the guts.
[336:22.24]Oh my god, what the fuck did he just do?
[336:24.02]You stupid game.
[336:24.86]This game's fucking rigged.
[336:26.54]I can't believe he just died.
[336:28.44]Yeah, I literally just pressed one button and he died instantly.
[336:41.93]How am I supposed to get away from that?
[336:44.77]I'm not an intelligence character.
[336:47.23]So, I just die?
[336:51.51]I'm trying to stay in, but he can, like, push and... Batman sucks.
[337:05.16]Yeah, this is bullshit.
[337:06.14]I'm Batman.
[337:06.76]I'm going up against a bunch of fucking superheroes.
[337:08.64]Oh, I got money and can aim good.
[337:15.01]Cool.
[337:16.06]These guys have laser eyes.
[337:30.62]Your defense is too low?
[337:32.04]Yeah, but... Okay.
[337:32.54]Alright, hear me out.
[337:36.51]Intelligence moves...
[337:39.37]Defense means nothing.
[337:41.33]You only, you take less damage from intelligence moves based on your intelligence skill yourself.
[337:47.33]So if I'm not building an intelligence character, then I'm gonna get killed by the intelligence moves.
[337:53.89]You have no money and can't aim.
[337:55.39]So what do you?
[337:57.37]Um... I don't know, what...
[338:12.15]Alright, this guy sucks.
[338:13.35]Except for his skill.
[338:14.73]This is just a mirror match.
[338:16.73]Except he's kind of better than I am.
[338:30.62]I would love to do a move.
[338:32.28]My guy doesn't know what fucking state he's in.
[338:35.94]I'm going to get flawless, aren't I?
[339:01.87]My loyalty is not high enough, so if I try to tell him to do a move, he blacks out.
[339:23.64]This guy's blacking out like 10 times a match because we don't have a great relationship together or something.
[339:31.09]Why is he blacking out?
[339:32.67]Why is he so confused?
[339:35.47]INTO THE FREEZER!
[339:38.19]No, he's the best thing we got right now.
[339:39.63]I can't.
[339:47.52]I gotta at least beat Zambr.
[339:49.42]Come on.
[339:53.42]It's time for some- Alright, how do I build loyalty?
[339:56.22]What's like the- What can I buy him?
[339:57.90]What item can I give him to make him more loyal?
[340:08.77]Best you actually have is probably Wellington.
[340:10.11]Probably, actually.
[340:10.81]Good.
[340:26.55]Good.
[340:27.41]Don't come in last place.
[340:28.23]I'll be happy.
[340:37.93]One more.
[340:38.11]Go ahead.
[340:39.35]Sit.
[340:39.77]Oh shit.
[340:58.04]Oh, thank god.
[341:09.17]Uh, I mean, I... I'm not gonna get any money, but maybe I'll get fame.
[341:15.01]Possible that I'll get fame?
[341:20.35]Hard to tell.
[341:28.32]How come you beat him without the last two?
[341:30.78]Threw coins in the air.
[341:32.22]And whatever one landed on heads three times, that's the one I win.
[341:35.50]Needs more loyalty, that's why.
[341:38.50]The more loyalty he has, the more... Alright.
[341:40.72]Loyalty is, like, the most important stat, in my opinion, at this point.
[341:45.58]Because if you tell him to do moves, and a third of the moves you tell him to do, he doesn't do, I mean, that's... I mean, that's less damage.
[341:59.23]I'm not gonna get any money, but... Will I at least get fame or something?
[342:08.12]I got 300 bucks.
[342:08.76]That's not... Okay, I'm happy with that.
[342:12.12]Aim.
[342:16.40]What about auto-fight?
[342:17.98]The problem with auto-fight is, from what I've heard, the CPU is notoriously, unbelievably stupid.
[342:25.71]Apparently.
[342:29.61]Like, sometimes it just will walk around and won't do anything.
[342:37.58]Very nice.
[342:44.72]You tried.
[342:45.16]You tried your best.
[342:46.43]I need to win a tournament.
[343:15.70]Maybe this one.
[343:17.75]Or... I gotta win money.
[343:20.55]We'll get him ready for this one.
[343:21.55]Should I just rest him up and just kind of fight the D?
[343:25.63]I can't do Crab Cup.
[343:26.77]I'm not good enough for C. Maybe I should... I need $2,000.
[343:34.78]It's so important.
[343:38.46]Rest him up.
[343:40.38]Get into that tournament and win.
[343:47.88]I actually will lose.
[343:49.48]I will softlock myself.
[343:53.02]Alright, let's go win this.
[343:57.25]You can't go lower than zero, so don't worry.
[344:16.50]I love this game.
[344:17.46]It's so much fun.
[344:20.32]I love just, like, needing to do better and try harder and train better.
[344:25.17]You gotta make a golem or a jelly.
[344:26.65]They're both pretty pog, in my opinion.
[344:29.01]The naga is good only once it's been trained to shitload.
[344:37.67]Don't... Okay.
[344:39.86]So... Different types peak at different places, right?
[344:47.71]So, from my understanding is some of the base monsters, like year one is where you peak and you get the most amount of stat increases.
[344:56.26]Some of them are like year three, near old age, you get the most amount of stat increases.
[345:00.34]Where, what is this type?
[345:02.78]Is this later on in life or?
[345:04.10]Certain monsters have different growth spurts.
[345:11.53]Yeah, so the base that I have here, it's peaking now.
[345:16.63]Okay.
[345:19.95]Why are you doing the Jerma explain thing?
[345:29.17]You, dude, you peaked in high school.
[345:30.65]I actually didn't, though.
[345:40.20]I peaked in, I don't know, like ten, five years ago.
[345:43.24]I didn't peak in high school.
[345:51.25]I definitely am past my peak of, I don't know, I think maybe I'm coming down.
[345:55.85]I think I still got it, though.
[345:56.85]Did you see that TikTok orangutan dance?
[346:00.73]Alright, let's win.
[346:02.62]I need money.
[346:26.40]Alright, bounce it back.
[346:27.74]Bounce it back.
[346:28.16]40.
[346:30.70]I'm good.
[346:36.49]See, the thing is, I'm not even ranking down to do this.
[346:47.89]I haven't won a C cup elimination tournament.
[346:52.71]So I mean like, I got held back like six times in the eighth grade.
[346:57.57]I'm still in the eighth grade, right?
[347:15.08]Yeah, I'm like 19 in the eighth grade.
[347:22.42]Alright, let's go.
[347:28.93]Is that even possible?
[347:29.91]I don't... I don't think so.
[347:35.21]What happens?
[347:36.11]I don't think that happens.
[347:40.55]What happens if you get held back like four times?
[347:44.21]Doesn't... Once you hit the soft cap for the first year, you have to go to the shrine and ask to reset their... Oh, I thought you were talking about what happens if you stay back four times.
[347:53.04]Oh, so you have to go to a shrine?
[347:54.20]I was trying to figure out what the fuck you were talking about.
[348:00.06]Okay.
[348:01.69]Stay away from the intelligence moves, I think.
[348:04.21]Yeah.
[348:10.01]This stab is really good just to farm these lower ranks, though.
[348:15.45]This character's gonna die.
[348:16.69]How long did the, um... What are the types that I have?
[348:20.53]I think I have a wall, right?
[348:25.66]The obsidian wall?
[348:32.28]Again, quick.
[348:41.22]See, it's a wall.
[348:42.16]It's a bug in Batman.
[348:45.40]You have Wellington.
[348:46.14]I know, but I have to make money.
[348:47.52]I have to make money and I have to get to at least C or B rank so I can at least... This monster is peaking right now, so I have to train this monster, try to win at least to like B or A rank, so then I can actually get some cool monsters and rare ones.
[349:05.91]I will let Wellington shine, I promise.
[349:07.63]Maybe I'll combine them.
[349:17.71]Should I combine Wellington and Bug Batman?
[349:19.80]Maybe that would be better.
[349:35.90]Alright.
[349:37.08]Cute.
[349:39.42]Bye-bye.
[349:54.81]Uh, Winston's passed away.
[349:55.79]You actually, they actually can die.
[350:01.31]Alright.
[350:01.91]$2,000.
[350:01.93]$2,200.
[350:01.97]Maybe you'll get a little bit of fame.
[350:07.37]Have to get to Elise C with this monster.
[350:10.37]This game's like Dark Souls.
[350:11.41]You're supposed to just lose a bunch of times until you get, like, the right combo.
[350:14.67]$2,150. $2,150.
[350:25.63]I'll go to Najeel, whatever that is.
[350:36.73]Learned more?
[350:39.01]Good.
[350:44.87]Yes.
[350:48.78]You can't do a tournament back-to-back!
[350:51.72]No!
[350:51.84]That... What's wrong with this guy?
[351:00.01]Why don't you ask me that?
[351:02.69]Consider... What?
[351:07.50]Retire?
[351:14.92]You're not even two years old.
[351:16.42]What do you mean, retired?
[351:19.60]You're getting old?
[351:20.38]How long did they live?
[351:22.99]Are you shitting me?
[351:28.82]They die one year and eight months.
[351:35.70]He's 68.
[351:35.98]You need to start training Bug Robin.
[351:48.83]Okay.
[351:49.63]Battle.
[351:51.95]When's the next- Okay, here it is.
[351:53.27]He's gonna win this.
[351:54.42]He's gonna get to B rank.
[351:55.30]We're gonna freeze his ass.
[351:56.76]And then we're gonna combine him with Wellington.
[352:00.80]And then we're going to have good base stats there.
[352:02.68]We'll take Wellington all the way up to B rank.
[352:04.66]I'm not going to stop streaming, am I?
[352:08.85]I'm having too good of a time right now.
[352:10.85]I love this game.
[352:11.43]That'll be alright.
[352:26.56]Alright, so he's getting to the end here.
[352:29.04]Well, let's rest him up.
[352:36.47]See if we can take him to at least up to B rank.
[352:40.03]Which, then combine him with Wellington and see what we get.
[352:51.66]Go for it.
[352:59.13]All the way, nice.
[353:06.20]Yeah, we're really starting to lose the prime there.
[353:10.70]It was like 18, 19, 18, 17, 18, 18.
[353:11.70]Now it's 9.
[353:13.22]Alright.
[353:13.68]I don't think I want to give anything too expensive.
[353:23.79]What's for dinner?
[353:44.42]train.
[353:44.86]Let's do... What if I really need life, maybe?
[353:50.38]At this point, maybe I should just go all in on power.
[353:53.19]Just hope for the best.
[353:53.85]What do you think?
[354:03.65]Give him a cup of jelly for his last meal.
[354:05.67]I guess he'll eat one more time.
[354:20.69]300.
[354:20.71]I don't think I'll even be able to beat Rank C. I think we freeze him now.
[354:40.19]Pass the Prime here. 314.
[354:53.36]Seems well and not even tired.
[354:58.78]We'll get him in one more tournament.
[355:15.71]Good.
[355:17.71]What happens when they die?
[355:19.85]Um... They die.
[355:28.20]Unless I freeze him.
[355:28.86]I can freeze him and combine him.
[355:30.42]Which is why I'm going to do that.
[355:32.66]That's kind of the point.
[355:38.76]I'm not going to use any more stress reducers on him either.
[355:42.79]Yeah, there's a little funeral.
[355:43.95]There's a little like goodbye.
[355:59.61]Alright, can we do it?
[356:07.36]Train twice, rest.
[356:09.82]I'm just going straight power.
[356:12.10]Just power.
[356:16.60]There is no tournament next week.
[356:23.30]Hope somebody freezes me when I get old and pass my prime.
[356:32.68]That was good.
[356:39.16]Seems well.
[356:40.17]One more training session.
[356:41.53]This is the last time we will ever train this piece of absolute dog shit.
[356:59.34]Couldn't even get enough C-Ring.
[357:09.16]Alright, rest up.
[357:10.47]It's time to battle.
[357:16.77]I'm just kidding.
[357:17.39]I'm very fond of this little guy.
[357:22.85]Okay.
[357:23.81]Very well.
[357:25.11]Loyalty's pretty good.
[357:25.99]I think we're going to get our ass kicked, but I'll try it.
[357:31.38]He has three moves.
[357:40.05]And then into the freezer.
[357:48.09]Have increased my power by like 20 plus percent though.
[357:54.45]Some new faces here.
[357:55.36]Alright, Zamber.
[357:57.92]Let's go.
[358:03.62]330.
[358:06.24]High defense, but...
[358:08.19]I do have a lot of power.
[358:09.80]Let's go for it.
[358:10.38]Let's see if I can just get in there and smash.
[358:14.22]Don't want to get hit by that.
[358:26.99]Good start.
[358:27.43]Keep it up.
[358:28.79]Don't do anything yet.
[358:29.75]Go for it.
[358:34.08]Very good.
[358:39.86]Alright, just hang back a little bit.
[358:41.26]Don't get killed.
[358:41.98]I need 14 guts to do this move.
[358:45.26]Don't even you dare.
[358:57.14]Okay, thank god.
[358:59.66]Win us a championship before retirement.
[359:01.26]Come on, man.
[359:11.82]You're gonna stream till like 12 a.m.
[359:14.90]Well, we started really late because the game didn't come out till 5 Pacific.
[359:19.64]We will absolutely be playing this tomorrow.
[359:21.38]I have to beat the game.
[359:25.90]Tomorrow's the Game Awards at 4, 5 p.m.
[359:28.84]Pacific.
[359:29.22]I'll figure whatever it is.
[359:32.08]And then after the Game Awards, Game Awards is gonna be what, like two, three hours?
[359:34.48]We're gonna go right from the Game Awards to this for like another three or four hours.
[359:43.59]430?
[359:43.61]Yeah.
[359:45.21]We'll start around the same time we did today.
[359:51.48]But I'm not done tonight.
[359:56.34]At least I want to get through.
[359:57.16]I want to combine somebody and get a good round floor for the next monster.
[360:11.76]Yeah, what is that little thing?
[360:12.90]Offree?
[360:16.26]We got our ass kicked by Reknan last time.
[360:18.48]It's a new day.
[360:25.36]Just shred through that defense.
[360:28.96]It's a DPS race.
[360:30.28]I hope I can actually do moves.
[360:39.17]Good.
[360:42.07]Dodge again.
[360:43.23]Nice.
[360:43.95]Alright.
[360:44.63]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[360:47.11]Alright, get in there.
[360:48.21]He's using all his guts.
[360:49.19]Beautiful.
[360:54.28]Alright, this is good.
[360:55.26]One more.
[360:55.56]Alright, back it up.
[361:16.76]I... We're in pretty good shape.
[361:19.45]We'll be at B rank.
[361:20.19]That little weirdo.
[361:36.83]Hey, who said he was past his prime?
[361:38.55]Not yet.
[361:40.55]Another week.
[361:42.10]Maybe.
[361:46.76]Alright, this is the 2-0.
[361:48.76]Offery.
[361:51.94]I'm very curious of how strong you are.
[362:00.01]Okay.
[362:01.57]You're very, very weak, but you're impossible to hit.
[362:07.53]Stay in close.
[362:08.67]The intelligence moves are going to kill me in one hit.
[362:12.28]Get in close, close, close, close, close, close.
[362:22.84]Stay in close.
[362:28.14]He can't even hurt you.
[362:28.96]Just stay in close.
[362:29.68]Let the guts build up.
[362:30.44]He's gonna waste all of his toy hammer bullshit.
[362:33.42]Just don't let him do an intelligence move.
[362:36.32]Okay, get him.
[362:46.09]Yes!
[362:47.79]Take that motherfucker outside.
[362:52.11]Yes.
[363:03.82]Okay, is anybody else undefeated?
[363:06.76]Pivorus is currently undefeated.
[363:09.50]Pivorus.
[363:20.61]Not anymore.
[363:21.07]Well, I'm going to lose to Suspain.
[363:27.18]It's a mirror.
[363:36.16]Alright, let's get in there.
[363:40.12]That's why you're so dangerous.
[363:41.18]You have a lot of health.
[363:41.96]Not a lot of defense, though.
[363:44.69]You're just a gigantic damage sponge.
[363:47.17]Alright, get in there.
[363:51.61]Jesus Christ.
[363:52.37]Please.
[363:58.51]Please.
[364:03.55]Watch that.
[364:03.91]I'm gonna build up guts.
[364:05.51]Don't just spam.
[364:06.43]This is how he wins fights.
[364:09.17]He's just a... Like watermelon chewing gum.
[364:13.15]That's fine.
[364:14.05]Use it all.
[364:14.67]Go.
[364:15.57]Come on, dude.
[364:16.15]I have to hit him like three times.
[364:21.11]And go.
[364:21.35]Oh, get that.
[364:23.61]Get out of here.
[364:26.01]Now just don't die from...
[364:31.13]Now just let it, just wait it out.
[364:33.83]Stay in close and wait it out.
[364:34.73]Got it.
[364:51.12]Yeah, you build up a bunch of speed, you build up a bunch of health.
[364:54.40]And then you become... You get hit two or three times, doesn't matter.
[364:58.14]You can dodge the rest.
[365:11.07]Is... Have I secured it?
[365:12.19]I think I have to win one more match and it's secured.
[365:15.23]I know.
[365:18.79]Because if I have five wins, it's impossible for anybody else to get to five wins, right?
[365:31.26]As long as he doesn't die on the floor, then we should be fine.
[365:37.85]If he dies in the arena, then that's bad.
[365:39.17]Which I think can happen.
[365:45.97]Alright, here comes a real test.
[365:46.87]This guy beat me bad last time.
[365:48.98]It's the monkey.
[365:55.40]It's gonna take a Christmas miracle to not lose to this guy.
[366:00.60]I want to get hit by the intelligence moves, so I have to stay back and then run forward when I want to do something.
[366:07.99]Alright.
[366:12.35]Back it up.
[366:15.95]I want to get hit by his int move.
[366:20.24]What does that do?
[366:22.58]They're booing him from eating a banana.
[366:23.98]Okay.
[366:25.40]Stay back.
[366:27.32]Int.
[366:31.52]Back it up.
[366:35.92]That's fine.
[366:36.36]That's fine.
[366:36.68]That's not a problem.
[366:48.70]Don't... There's so much tug of war going on here.
[366:51.54]Go ahead.
[367:03.35]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[367:05.05]Holy shit.
[367:05.75]Thank God.
[367:06.42]That would have probably done 100 damage.
[367:11.86]That was really, really lucky.
[367:20.22]I win.
[367:25.44]Do I win?
[367:26.13]Okay.
[367:28.37]Reckon?
[367:28.59]No.
[367:32.51]Uh, Pivris needs to win the rest of his games.
[367:36.31]And Offrey needs to win the rest of his games.
[367:38.31]And... It's a tie.
[367:40.36]Who's next?
[367:46.24]Okay, Reknan needs to beat Pivris right... Oh, it's over.
[367:49.46]No.
[367:49.90]Okay, Reknan needs to win right now.
[367:53.32]There it is.
[367:53.62]Okay, now... Offrey has to lose their next match.
[368:00.90]Zamber is lost every single time, but let's see.
[368:05.31]It's going to be me versus Offrey in the championship.
[368:13.61]Unless I win right now.
[368:19.08]Is what it comes down to.
[368:19.88]This is to secure the C-ranked championship.
[368:31.62]I'm looking to try to get hit by the intelligence moves if he has any on his bar, which he doesn't, so this is going to be just a fight.
[368:36.77]It's a mirror match.
[368:37.44]Good luck.
[368:58.29]Yes!
[368:58.95]That's it!
[369:00.17]C-Rank!
[369:01.45]C-Rank Championship, baby!
[369:09.88]Hell yeah.
[369:13.74]It's the last thing this guy's ever gonna see, unfortunately.
[369:18.09]Well, no, he's gonna be combined.
[369:19.17]His DNA is gonna get combined with somebody else.
[369:26.74]I did not have any faith at all.
[369:27.88]That was... That was my mistake.
[369:30.66]I should have given him some encouragement.
[369:36.97]Now we'll have access to B rank, which is great.
[369:43.21]If I go 7 and 0, though... I'll get a ton of fame, I think.
[369:47.12]Alright, what monster is this?
[369:54.18]Nicole?
[370:02.95]You're just hard to hit.
[370:04.31]That's all.
[370:07.54]Nothing is too scary.
[370:21.43]Just have to hit you a few times.
[370:22.43]There's one.
[370:31.57]That's all I need.
[370:37.30]That secures it, I think, as long as I don't get hit by something horrible here.
[370:49.17]This just drains my mana.
[370:53.09]Still win by percentage here.
[370:58.53]Oh, you're a pain in the ass.
[371:04.66]Still win by percentage.
[371:08.32]Oh my god.
[371:09.62]What?
[371:09.84]I don't know.
[371:11.46]What's the percentage?
[371:14.33]Wow.
[371:15.17]That was annoying.
[371:18.47]That was annoying.
[371:21.07]That's alright.
[371:21.77]Sometimes the champion can't go undefeated.
[371:39.32]Let them play out the rest of the tournament, whatever.
[371:45.00]Why is the cat winning?
[371:46.19]Uh, high speed and annoying moves that drain guts.
[371:52.55]Nice work.
[372:00.98]Did he lose every single match?
[372:07.08]Zamber lost every match.
[372:09.16]I know what that's like.
[372:09.88]I can't talk shit.
[372:18.84]Only 16 fame?
[372:20.12]I was almost undefeated in the tournament.
[372:27.25]Perfect.
[372:28.07]Perfect combination here.
[372:32.39]Good job.
[372:32.81]You got us a B rank.
[372:37.92]You don't want to fight.
[372:39.38]You want to rest.
[372:41.66]It's time to rest.
[372:51.08]What food are you going to get?
[372:51.99]Oh, I got five grand.
[372:53.61]Holy shit.
[372:54.23]I'm making money now.
[373:00.09]Have a cup of jelly.
[373:05.73]You did good.
[373:07.64]Who is it?
[373:09.40]Oh, I think this is it.
[373:14.86]Do I actually get to become like an actual trainer?
[373:17.50]Rank three, right?
[373:27.87]Oh yeah.
[373:31.59]Professional.
[373:32.35]I am now, I can now open up those other boxes.
[373:35.33]It's time for toxic.
[373:44.28]Very good job.
[373:46.38]Good work.
[373:52.35]So, before we do anything, let's freeze you.
[373:54.91]I'll be using you later.
[373:58.49]Don't forget about spot- Yeah, I gotta remember the exact ones.
[374:07.13]Alright.
[374:11.95]Alright.
[374:13.84]The first one was SpongeBob SquarePants.
[374:19.98]And it was the... Which one was it?
[374:24.06]Battle Rehydrated?
[374:24.98]Alright, this is this one.
[374:27.44]Generate.
[374:38.11]I'm not an authorized trainer.
[374:48.72]That's very high level.
[374:50.56]I need to have... I need special rank.
[375:00.55]Alright, how about... Christmas by...
[375:17.66]Christmas by Paul Cardell.
[375:19.30]What you got, Paul?
[375:34.76]It's like a cosmic stone.
[375:46.55]That's pretty good.
[375:50.70]168 intelligence?
[375:52.69]Hold on to it for now.
[376:28.42]Cosmic order.
[376:37.87]That's cosmic order.
[376:45.19]Cosmic calamity.
[377:00.01]Close enough.
[377:05.84]Cosmic Calamity.
[377:06.58]Alright, freeze this motherfucker.
[377:14.08]Wait, hold on.
[377:15.76]I'm going to combine this and the other one.
[377:18.74]These are really good base stats.
[377:24.98]If I combine this with the dragon, this could be pretty big.
[377:33.11]Save the game.
[377:42.01]Okay, let's do it.
[377:45.65]I need, I need, I need, yeah.
[377:47.69]Freeze.
[377:51.76]Cosmic Andy.
[377:54.34]Oh yeah, Cosmic Andy.
[377:55.48]That's my favorite character.
[378:00.88]I need something good.
[378:04.57]Bug Batman.
[378:08.79]And Cosmic Calamity.
[378:17.64]Doesn't know what the sub is.
[378:21.16]What is that?
[378:22.08]That's a secret sub?
[378:23.20]I saved it.
[378:38.46]That's a rare subtype.
[378:40.56]That's why it looks cosmic.
[378:47.62]Crimson Eyed?
[378:48.52]Oh, that's already what... Bug Batman already is a Crimson Eyed.
[378:56.18]No.
[379:00.20]What about Wellington?
[379:02.70]And Cosmic Calamity.
[379:24.43]Noodle.
[379:27.03]And Cosmic Calamity.
[379:37.02]This can be used as secret seasoning.
[379:38.40]The prospect here is unsure.
[379:42.62]Silhouette?
[379:44.71]I think I'm just going to get Cosmic Calamity.
[379:48.57]That's like a rare subtype.
[379:49.81]Why don't I just level that one up?
[379:58.19]I'm just gonna use the wall, why not?
[379:59.35]I might as well use it.
[380:08.82]It's got really awesome base stats too.
[380:12.12]Yeah, let's bring out Calamity, let's go.
[380:13.56]168 base intelligence, that's awesome.
[380:29.93]I'm sorry about the music.
[380:31.19]I can't help it.
[380:39.68]Alright, let's go.
[380:40.28]What do you like?
[380:49.73]Likes meat and doesn't like tablets.
[380:53.29]Are you off-putting?
[380:59.02]Flattening and charge.
[381:00.50]No intelligence move.
[381:01.84]We gotta get him out there.
[381:06.25]It's just way too high.
[381:12.09]Study.
[381:22.85]Of the little bird.
[381:28.28]Scary.
[381:31.79]I almost fell out of the chair.
[381:34.09]I slipped.
[381:46.62]Try to get him to 200 before we take him to a tournament.
[381:53.65]He's supposed to be smart.
[382:03.94]Let's do a little bit of the mint leaf.
[382:06.44]Face sucks.
[382:12.14]Yeah, it's scary.
[382:18.53]Definitely can't do F rank.
[382:20.35]Uh, let's go.
[382:20.95]We'll do this one.
[382:21.55]It'll be alright.
[382:40.05]Good.
[382:41.59]How do you cheat?
[382:46.03]Don't cheat.
[382:46.51]I mean, don't cheat.
[382:47.31]Use that oil.
[382:54.85]Academic dishonesty.
[383:13.23]Anyone know how long the walls live?
[383:18.47]In general.
[383:18.87]You don't like ta- You like meat.
[383:24.65]Alright, we'll give you meat.
[383:26.41]Two weeks.
[383:38.78]100 years.
[383:43.17]We'll do this one.
[383:46.31]Maybe we'll just wait till... I think I could bring him.
[383:48.79]No, he needs an intelligence move.
[383:49.91]I gotta look at his stats again.
[384:00.47]Once he gets to 200 intelligence, I'm doing something else.
[384:03.15]Although, honestly, I really probably shouldn't even be doing this because he doesn't even have an intelligence move.
[384:10.65]I should be doing something else.
[384:18.13]Health, probably.
[384:21.36]Health and skill.
[384:24.48]Whoa, that speed though.
[384:25.91]Holy.
[384:27.69]Whoa, that's bad.
[384:52.35]Seems well.
[384:54.31]When's that battle?
[384:55.47]Nope.
[384:56.39]Yeah, we'll just do the official one.
[385:02.26]I'm going to keep doing this until it gets to 100.
[385:04.78]He'll get hit by everything.
[385:16.63]I hate this wall.
[385:17.61]Take a hammer to it already.
[385:32.42]Health, maybe?
[385:33.00]Yeah.
[385:34.74]How does a wall run?
[385:43.26]He's cheating.
[385:45.13]Why are they... I have so many bad-natured people.
[385:52.49]Scald.
[385:53.75]This looks like a PS2 loading screen.
[386:02.73]I know you don't want tablets, but I'm going to give them to you.
[386:16.00]Tablets are always a good decision.
[386:17.34]The benefits well outweigh the fact that he doesn't like it.
[386:25.63]Air entry?
[386:30.17]Yeah, okay.
[386:33.11]I wonder do... Should we just do it?
[386:38.93]I have got money.
[386:40.03]Should I just try?
[386:40.73]I know when they're like a baby baby under three or four months.
[386:47.38]It's usually not worth it.
[386:48.46]I need an intelligence move really bad.
[386:55.06]I have to get him an intelligence move.
[387:02.19]It's on sale right now.
[387:02.99]It's just way too young.
[387:10.12]I'm going to try to get the move.
[387:25.33]Will it not?
[387:25.77]It won't work.
[387:28.15]Save and do it.
[387:40.83]Alright, so now it doesn't matter.
[387:44.00]I'll rest up, though, because I want him to be very well rested.
[387:50.66]If I actually get an intelligence move, this is going to be huge.
[387:53.72]Sorry, I swallowed the back of my tongue.
[387:55.78]If I get an intelligence move, it's going to be huge.
[388:05.89]Okay.
[388:06.85]Int.
[388:07.37]There it is.
[388:08.65]Go for it.
[388:10.42]It's a chance to acquire a new technique.
[388:15.04]You can fight that guy.
[388:15.64]Who cares?
[388:15.98]Go for it.
[388:21.34]Monkey race.
[388:30.27]Beat him.
[388:32.69]Oh, the block.
[388:36.59]Is that technically cheating?
[388:49.13]He's gonna be a big deal now.
[388:53.51]I really hope that's an intelligence move, because if it is, then he's... This is the new... This guy will bring us to B at least.
[388:59.85]We'll get B rank with this guy.
[389:07.10]Teared?
[389:13.40]Good job.
[389:16.34]Very good, very good.
[389:17.58]This is huge.
[389:26.34]Go all the way.
[389:28.19]Get another skill.
[389:33.27]It's alright.
[389:33.83]It's okay.
[389:34.45]It's alright.
[389:34.85]You gotta move.
[389:35.46]That's all that mattered.
[389:38.66]It's okay.
[389:44.41]Try it again.
[389:58.29]There's another chance.
[389:59.01]Boom.
[390:01.71]Break out.
[390:02.09]Get out of the way.
[390:03.93]Dodge it.
[390:05.57]It's okay.
[390:07.91]All that matters is the move.
[390:12.69]Good job.
[390:14.29]Nice work.
[390:20.05]Seems pretty tired.
[390:20.79]Give it some rest.
[390:22.73]What is the move?
[390:35.11]Scratch.
[390:37.89]Why did you learn Scratch?
[390:39.67]And it sucks.
[391:15.06]I can't do that.
[391:15.62]We're going to have to do this one.
[391:17.30]Round robin, four entries, thousand gold.
[391:19.44]Go for it.
[391:26.35]Speed again.
[391:30.75]Load the save.
[391:31.47]No, I mean, he's got a new move.
[391:35.86]He gained a lot of stats, too.
[391:54.67]Have we got three weeks?
[392:06.15]What song was this from?
[392:07.19]I think this is from Christmas by Paul.
[392:11.87]Something like that Christmas by Paul.
[392:23.41]Did I just rest?
[392:24.53]He's tired.
[392:24.93]How tired is he?
[392:37.57]Did I just rest?
[392:39.01]Or should I rest?
[392:39.55]I forgot.
[392:41.91]Build the loyalty up?
[392:42.73]Yeah.
[392:46.03]Yeah, I'm not going to be left with... I'm going to stop the stream soon.
[392:51.67]We'll come back at it tomorrow.
[392:56.46]11.30?
[392:56.48]11?
[392:56.54]Okay.
[392:56.78]Alright, yeah, we'll end.
[393:01.38]We'll end soon.
[393:04.56]Oh, give him a cup of jelly.
[393:11.41]Stress.
[393:18.71]I want to fight at least one time, and then we'll end.
[393:29.62]I looked it up.
[393:30.76]Your Monel is a rare class that's the highest ranked Monel type.
[393:36.34]But your Naga is a D class and basically garbage breed.
[393:42.05]Really?
[393:42.35]Okay, let's, uh, let's eat that stress reducer.
[394:00.11]Train a little bit, maybe some intelligence.
[394:08.74]Thinking about maybe a little bit of intelligence.
[394:13.45]Batman got farther than the dumb slab ever will.
[394:16.21]I think he's going to be alright.
[394:31.86]Alright, battle is... I don't have... I gotta just do E. I definitely do not have what it takes.
[394:42.29]Just rest.
[394:43.87]I'm gonna go to bed.
[394:47.04]I will soon.
[394:48.10]Very soon.
[394:49.50]We'll see.
[394:49.94]I'll be around tomorrow.
[394:51.60]Game Awards.
[395:01.74]bottom it's like bottom five monsters in the game are you serious that sucks alright after this we'll I'll be done this train a little bit more and we'll go from here maybe one more tournament maybe
[395:39.84]I got high defense.
[395:43.07]Let's try that new move, Scratch.
[395:44.21]I mean, it's kind of funny looking.
[395:58.19]85% and you won't even do anything.
[395:59.39]Come on, man.
[396:04.68]Ooh, that hurts guts too.
[396:16.07]That was fucking stupid.
[396:29.71]Good.
[396:33.35]Good.
[396:35.27]Pretty close.
[396:37.67]Dodge it.
[396:39.23]I think that's a win.
[396:46.93]No more bets?
[396:47.55]Yeah, no more betting.
[397:05.94]I want to get to a point where I have 800 power and shit, you know what I mean?
[397:18.39]I've only peed once today.
[397:21.25]I should drink some more water.
[397:21.91]I drank water right here.
[397:22.61]Uh, just go for the one that hits.
[397:33.67]Which is flattening.
[397:34.91]Don't let this little shit beat me, please.
[397:57.75]Oh my god.
[397:58.31]Am I going to lose for the first time ever?
[398:01.26]The rabbit.
[398:01.76]That can't happen.
[398:12.48]He's going to KO me.
[398:19.55]Do something!
[398:20.47]What the fuck?
[398:26.50]The rabbit is the shittiest enemy in the whole game, and I actually lost.
[398:30.18]Alright, I have to beat you.
[398:45.83]How did you not get an intelligence move?
[398:47.21]I don't understand.
[398:55.03]Cut.
[399:21.21]Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[399:22.35]Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[399:22.93]Combo, combo, combo, combo, combo.
[399:28.83]Back this shit up.
[399:29.75]No!
[399:29.95]62% swing at him!
[400:13.68]He just, his loyalty is too low.
[400:16.17]Tried to bring him in too early.
[400:17.21]Damn it.
[400:21.75]I thought I had that too.
[400:24.39]At least I get the money back.
[400:25.33]It's fine.
[400:35.53]That's okay.
[400:40.07]Uh, I'm not praising you at all.
[400:42.89]I'm sorry, but you don't get praised.
[400:48.45]Style even.
[400:49.19]I don't want to... The last character was so spoiled.
[400:53.83]He wouldn't listen to half the things I said.
[401:06.78]Send his ass on an errantry.
[401:08.20]It's too expensive right now.
[401:14.99]But I want to.
[401:27.37]Official tournament.
[401:32.43]He's not ready.
[401:35.45]Actually, just not ready.
[401:37.15]I need at least 30 to 40 loyalty.
[401:38.47]Not worth it.
[401:50.06]I want to send him on an air entry so bad.
[401:52.46]Not going to, though.
[401:53.38]Don't do it.
[401:53.98]Just train normally.
[401:57.92]I'll eventually get an intelligence move, I will.
[401:59.52]That was pretty good.
[402:15.09]How much garlic do you have to eat to become handsome?
[402:18.74]Couple cloves a month.
[402:31.80]Eat the banana?
[402:32.62]I think the banana is killing me.
[402:33.80]That's another good one.
[402:36.91]Probably seven or eight.
[402:39.47]Damn.
[402:57.32]Why buff intelligence with no moves?
[402:59.50]Well, because there's a certain finite amount of time in a monster's life that they will gain stats.
[403:08.81]They'll gain way more stats than they would when they were a baby or when they're older.
[403:12.61]So, I'm just trying to dump intelligence into this motherfucker.
[403:17.21]So eventually, when I get- if I just hammer intelligence,
[403:21.89]I'll be able to get him an intelligence move and he'll have like 400 intelligence and I'll laser beam people in one second and he'll be gone.
[403:30.52]Gone.
[403:31.94]Disintegrated.
[403:43.06]Intelligence again.
[403:47.62]After this one, I will... I'm going to do one more tournament.
[403:52.12]No, I'm not.
[403:56.02]Errantry.
[404:01.18]He is... Fuck the Errantry.
[404:03.92]Forget the Errantry.
[404:06.57]He's got so much health.
[404:08.39]So much... Not health.
[404:09.27]Whatever.
[404:10.35]He's getting a lot of intelligence from this.
[404:11.89]Do it again.
[404:14.95]Just do it again.
[404:22.40]He's killing it.
[404:23.26]Little ding.
[404:27.00]There it is.
[404:27.66]Alright.
[404:29.24]I need an intelligence move.
[404:31.19]Jelly.
[404:52.55]okay probably should I send him on an errantry and just say screw it I really want to unfreeze Batman and do a tournament
[405:17.99]Rest up.
[405:18.63]You're going on an errantry tomorrow.
[405:21.37]If I lose all my money, whatever, I'll just bring Batman out of retirement.
[405:26.32]And just have him win a C rank or something.
[405:27.70]Or a B rank.
[405:28.40]Or a D rank.
[405:33.67]Why are you even increasing intelligence?
[405:35.29]How smart do you have to be to just crush someone?
[405:40.52]But look at him.
[405:41.02]He's made out of galaxies and planets and stars and stuff.
[405:44.02]He's eventually going to be able to learn a move that is going to be like a galaxy bomb or something.
[405:48.97]I don't know.
[405:49.33]He's intelligence based, right?
[405:50.93]Alright, let's save it.
[406:04.21]Errantry intelligence.
[406:05.27]Let's go.
[406:06.86]2,000 bucks.
[406:07.90]Don't care.
[406:10.13]Intelligence.
[406:12.29]There is some chance to acquire a new technique.
[406:17.55]Ooh.
[406:20.43]Uh, go after this guy.
[406:24.05]Come on!
[406:37.47]I'm looking for 10 intelligence each time.
[406:48.54]Beautiful.
[406:50.75]Bruising past 200 plus intelligence at this young of an age.
[406:53.69]He's a little genius.
[407:01.51]We got a raid?
[407:03.65]Oh shit, there's a raid.
[407:07.41]Who raided?
[407:11.24]Oh shit.
[407:12.92]Atriok!
[407:15.64]What's going on?
[407:16.24]Thanks for the raid.
[407:17.82]We did it?
[407:20.90]That's a big raid.
[407:21.52]Yeah, that's a lot of people.
[407:24.80]What's going on?
[407:25.42]Thanks for the raid, man.
[407:27.94]Playing Monster Rancher 2, the new meta of Twitch.
[407:31.42]Guaranteed.
[407:31.93]Don't let me be the one to tell you.
[407:34.31]Alright, we didn't do this one last time.
[407:39.61]I'm not doing a tuber voice.
[407:41.03]I'm just being in person.
[407:43.45]He couldn't make it last time.
[407:44.41]He's going to get up there this time.
[407:45.35]I guarantee it.
[407:52.21]Do it.
[407:56.31]He got it.
[407:56.69]He's got it.
[407:56.99]He's got it.
[407:57.29]He's got it.
[407:58.19]Oh, that's slick.
[408:01.99]Any new technique?
[408:06.08]No new technique.
[408:07.84]Go one more chance.
[408:11.44]Big gorilla.
[408:13.98]He's going to knock it out of the park and he's going to get an intelligence technique and all the haters, all the doubters are going to be shut up right now.
[408:21.87]Welcome everybody.
[408:28.23]Did I just hit him in the bum?
[408:33.14]I'm hot.
[408:33.62]This is to prove how intelligent I am by fucking with a wild gorilla?
[408:42.16]Is this intelligent or is this really stupid?
[408:47.62]Stop pretending to be normal.
[408:48.86]I'm fine.
[408:49.62]I'm not normal.
[408:55.31]He got it.
[408:56.45]I think he actually did it.
[409:01.25]New technique.
[409:09.71]Oh, shit.
[409:10.21]I have to fight this.
[409:12.73]Low defense.
[409:14.41]High health.
[409:17.91]I was going to crush this guy.
[409:20.49]Just scratch him and crush him.
[409:24.10]I don't even play.
[409:25.52]It's the computer.
[409:29.90]Fight him!
[409:30.46]Come on!
[409:38.36]Get in there and smash- smoosh him!
[409:43.40]The computer is so stupid.
[409:45.20]Stop just touching- stop walking into him.
[409:47.92]And crush him flat like this, like a pancake.
[409:52.48]There's no timer either, so you have to die.
[409:58.91]Do some other move, please!
[410:13.64]He just has to hit... Good.
[410:21.67]Not good.
[410:22.61]One damage?
[410:28.09]Attack him!
[410:30.37]Probably has 80 plus guts right now.
[410:32.57]There it is.
[410:33.81]That's what we wanted to see.
[410:35.63]Do it again.
[410:40.99]I don't think it's gonna happen.
[410:49.67]Come on!
[410:55.89]The scratch is the best move I have right now, and he needs to start using it.
[411:01.09]Or just... bow?
[411:02.67]What was the bow for?
[411:07.53]Do something.
[411:14.24]Oh, you did a move.
[411:14.90]Finally.
[411:16.76]Great.
[411:18.24]Very good.
[411:18.94]It's close.
[411:27.47]Do it!
[411:28.13]Get him!
[411:30.97]Get him!
[411:43.86]Good.
[411:44.18]I have to hit him three more times.
[411:49.04]Again?
[411:49.30]Do it again.
[411:53.14]This idiot has two other moves.
[411:54.80]He's not doing any of them.
[412:07.81]He might actually win by doing this over and over again.
[412:10.09]He's clutching it out right now.
[412:13.24]This could be huge.
[412:15.38]Alright, yeah.
[412:16.14]Shoulder tackle.
[412:17.24]Shoulder tackle again.
[412:18.12]You got it in you?
[412:19.56]He just fucking won.
[412:20.54]You just beat him.
[412:22.16]You actually just beat him.
[412:24.76]Actually just won.
[412:27.38]Give me a new technique.
[412:37.14]I did the whole thing.
[412:38.64]Great, Cosmic Calamity.
[412:42.92]It's an easy battle to win against those guys.
[412:45.96]Let's go back.
[412:49.81]I didn't get an, uh... Prize money?
[412:57.69]Oh, it was 50% off because we won.
[413:03.32]Defeated a wild monster.
[413:04.44]It's wonderful.
[413:05.32]It could not acquire any techniques, but its errantry was very successful.
[413:10.62]It was.
[413:10.88]I think you can catch them.
[413:15.20]Pretty tired.
[413:19.87]Alright.
[413:22.09]Look at this data here.
[413:31.34]This guy's gonna be at 300 intelligence before the first goddamn tournament.
[413:39.58]Go to YouTube and type worst Monster Rancher 2 monster.
[413:43.19]It's literally this one.
[413:48.41]What?
[414:11.71]Is it actually the worst one?
[414:16.05]Do I just have this so wrong?
[414:18.43]But he looks cool.
[414:19.13]Oh, let me turn this down.
[414:37.74]I can't hear this.
[414:56.43]Raising the worst monster in the game.
[415:01.75]Are you fucking kidding me?
[415:02.69]What?
[415:26.41]Did I give it a min leave?
[415:27.82]I must have done.
[415:28.88]It's not what it can't be.
[415:33.50]What?
[415:35.20]Wasn't paying attention at all.
[415:37.93]Woo!
[415:39.61]What does it say at the end?
[415:40.61]Plus three again.
[415:41.73]Plus three again.
[415:52.04]500?
[415:52.06]That's 500 stats.
[415:53.50]That's a lot.
[415:58.09]I want to hear him say.
[416:00.85]What's wrong?
[416:01.85]We died.
[416:04.09]He's dead?
[416:05.05]What do you mean he's dead?
[416:07.51]Colt, I'm sorry about Proxima.
[416:10.27]Master.
[416:16.35]Is it actually the worst monster in the whole game?
[416:18.75]This is the worst combination in the game.
[416:25.67]I'm way too invested.
[416:28.53]Read the description of that video.
[416:33.71]Bugs and bad stat growth make Mono just terrible to try and raise.
[416:37.87]Worse than Metalners, since at least Metalners live 100 weeks longer.
[416:44.06]We try to raise Proxima the best we can and beat the Major 4.
[416:47.26]Shit.
[416:53.41]But what if they fix the bugs maybe in this release?
[416:58.65]His first intelligence learned move he gets when intelligence and speed are over 400.
[417:05.21]Are you telling me I gotta ice this guy because I can't even do this?
[417:22.44]Are you kidding me?
[417:26.61]Over 400 intelligence?
[417:28.65]What if I get to 400?
[417:30.93]I'm gonna get him to 400.
[417:35.30]Alright, so I get him to 400.
[417:37.94]Which, we're not even that far away.
[417:39.02]He needs 400 speed?
[417:45.73]Oh, that is not gonna happen.
[417:49.47]Wait, it's 400 combined intelligence and speed.
[417:55.35]So not 400 each.
[418:00.03]People are saying something about the Papa's Errantry.
[418:03.67]You need to do the Papa's Errantry to unlock Strange Light, which is an int move in the slot before Scratch.
[418:14.18]Okay, so I need... I think I'm... I got it.
[418:18.08]I think I'm there.
[418:21.04]Alright, so I gotta get to 4... So I gotta get to 330 Intelligence.
[418:27.80]Easiest thing I've ever done in my life.
[418:29.90]Let's go.
[418:30.20]I gotta leave.
[418:32.06]I'm so sorry.
[418:39.31]I just like screamed in your ear.
[418:40.63]I did not think it was going to be that loud.
[418:41.75]Yeah, it's time to go.
[418:49.11]It's time to go.
[418:50.43]I'll be live tomorrow.
[418:51.33]We'll pick right up tomorrow.
[418:52.19]Don't worry.
[418:54.77]Read the comments on that video.
[419:05.61]If you see this, it'd be so great to see playthroughs with all the unique monsters.
[419:09.27]This is nostalgic.
[419:11.73]Oh, you guys.
[419:17.44]Well, you know what?
[419:18.08]I'll tell you.
[419:18.54]This guy, Jack of Hearts.
[419:21.06]He's got Monster Rancher 2 channel, pretty much.
[419:24.62]Like, doing Monster Rancher 2 shit.
[419:27.08]You should fucking sub to this person.
[419:37.18]Give us a delayed raid song.
[419:42.24]I'm gonna just put the camera off.
[419:46.27]Thank you for the raid.
[419:54.76]I see a Monster Rancher 2 tomorrow as well as the Game Awards.
[420:05.94]I don't know what I'll do first.
[420:06.88]Probably Game Awards first.
[420:08.44]So I can just go right from that directly into this.
[420:13.62]Game Awards, alright, let me actually look that up and get a correct time for you here.
[420:17.02]Thanks for sticking around this long.
[420:23.30]I'm surprised there's this many people still here.
[420:26.22]It's very, very late.
[420:27.56]But I'm gonna play this game a lot.
[420:30.22]At least get to the end.
[420:30.94]Can't promise there'll be a face cam on every time, but you know, whatever.
[420:38.00]This game's incredible.
[420:38.96]It's a lot of fun.
[420:40.20]It's just a good time.
[420:41.98]So we're going to keep having it.
[420:44.82]Yeah, that's it.
[420:45.58]We'll end it there.
[420:47.18]Game awards are... What time?
[420:53.68]They are... 4.30?
[420:59.55]Yeah, 4.30.
[421:03.41]I'll be live at like 4.15.
[421:04.09]Just to kind of chill and wait for the broadcast to go live.
[421:09.23]So I'll be live at 4.15 Pacific time in the afternoon tomorrow.
[421:16.57]Take care of yourselves.
[421:18.35]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[421:19.09]I'm going to make sure I save the game.
[421:21.59]That's so unfortunate.
[421:22.43]This is the worst thing in the whole game.
[421:30.58]I got to get to S rank at least, right?
[421:43.46]It's about the personality of the monster, not the stats.
[421:46.84]You make the story.
[421:51.72]That's true.
[421:53.06]That is true.
[421:53.56]You do have a point.
[421:57.60]There was a lot of community subs today, too.
[421:59.42]I'm going to give 100, which is insane.
[422:02.22]It was a 75 community sub as well.
[422:10.12]That was Soveen and then Arawani.
[422:13.06]Thanks, both of you.
[422:14.50]Those are monsters.
[422:18.66]Very, very cool.
[422:19.76]And Atriok, thanks for the raid, too.
[422:21.51]You guys are still here from Atriok.
[422:22.89]Thanks for watching.
[422:24.05]Thanks for sticking around.
[422:24.95]Maybe we'll see you again.
[422:31.31]And we will see you tomorrow.
[422:38.56]He's spinning around in a circle.
[422:44.38]Uh, it's very late.
[422:45.32]Nobody's really live right now, but I will send you guys.
[422:48.26]I'm going to send you guys to Miskif.
[422:51.18]What are you doing, Miskif?
[422:53.46]Art contest?
[422:57.30]Alright.
[423:02.00]I'm following.
[423:03.18]Yeah, Miskif is live right now.
[423:06.79]Go say hello.
[423:07.45]Hello?
[423:10.54]No, you can say that I missed him in Smite because I play that game all the time and he didn't even ask to play with me, by the way.
[423:23.81]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[423:24.67]Take care.
[423:25.01]Have a great night.
[423:33.29]It's drama.
[423:35.87]Peep the horror.
[423:36.49]No more horror peeping.
[423:40.34]I'll see you guys later.
[423:43.24]Have a great night.
[423:43.84]Why is this five seconds?
[423:45.24]What do you mean five seconds?
[423:46.18]What are you talking about?
[423:46.84]I just said raid.
[423:47.98]What?
[423:50.50]Okay.
[423:51.20]For a second, I thought it was raiding in five seconds.
[423:53.20]I didn't have enough time.
[423:54.00]Everyone relax.
[423:57.21]We're fine.
[423:57.53]See you tomorrow for the game awards.
[424:02.79]Good night.
[424:03.19]Goodbye.
[424:03.83]Take care of yourselves.
[424:04.81]Go say hello to Mizkif.
[424:08.84]You better get me at least 7,000 viewers.
[424:10.67]Otherwise, come on.
[424:14.63]There's gotta be 7,000 people going over there.
[424:19.75]I am not... Well, you have to, because I just told you to.
[424:22.77]Come on, Gwen.
[424:26.80]Do a reverse raid song.
[424:28.08]Okay.
[424:28.34]... ... ... ...
[424:41.63]Did you tell what I said?
[424:49.88]I am excited for the game awards tomorrow, even though I played literally probably one game that came out in 2021.
[424:55.92]I'm going to have no idea what to even say.
[425:05.26]Alright, goodbye.
[425:06.88]Good night.
[425:22.98]you
