[00:15.37]Oh, dude.
[00:15.85]VOD.
[00:16.37]VOD.
[00:16.99]Oh, VOD.
[00:17.69]VOD.
[00:19.10]VOD.
[00:20.64]What?
[00:23.20]See, I can do it too.
[00:29.36]And I got mine out before you did.
[00:34.29]I was the first commenter.
[00:38.69]What's up?
[00:42.13]They do more EU streams?
[00:44.13]Nah.
[00:44.27]Nah.
[00:53.21]That was a little mean, but I don't know, dude.
[00:55.65]It's 2 o'clock.
[01:02.79]You must hate the EU.
[01:09.86]I do like 11 a.m.
[01:12.26]12 sometimes, but it's 2 o'clock.
[01:14.66]This is when I lose 3 o'clock.
[01:17.22]That's what I do.
[01:22.93]Today, everybody get really excited about today.
[01:26.47]I will wait until... I'm going to wait until at least all of EU is excited.
[01:34.46]And I can tell where you're from based on your names that pop up.
[01:41.14]We're going to be doing...
[01:43.87]Half sword half sword is it's a demo.
[01:46.97]It's a game I've seen a lot of people play it.
[01:48.53]You probably seen people play it.
[01:49.57]I haven't tried it yet.
[01:51.51]It's a medieval.
[01:54.50]It's a medieval kill each other game.
[01:56.14]I guess is the best way to describe it.
[02:03.48]Wait for like an hour or so, maybe a little bit longer depends.
[02:06.72]I also want to try this slot machine game.
[02:09.26]It's called Clover Pit.
[02:14.53]This guy rents an Audi.
[02:17.01]What's wrong with that?
[02:20.47]I like to cruise around town in my Audi.
[02:24.36]The window's down.
[02:29.82]That I've rented.
[02:40.65]Renting an Audi.
[02:43.19]No, I don't think so.
[02:54.61]You drive a hatchback.
[03:00.07]Who cares a car anybody drives?
[03:01.90]Hey, you know what?
[03:02.64]A car gets you from A to B. If I get from A to B, I'm good.
[03:10.36]That's all I care about.
[03:11.30]I just want to get from A to B. We're also going to do... We're going to play Chrono Trigger.
[03:30.90]The actual finale of that game.
[03:32.93]A couple days ago, I got nearly to the end, but I didn't want to just rush through it because it was about eight hours had gone by and I didn't want to just, oh, well, let's hurry, hurry, get to the end boss, get to the end of everything.
[03:44.17]So we can really take our time with the end, which is what I would prefer.
[03:50.12]You keep claiming that every time.
[03:53.20]Maybe the last like two or three times, but you never know.
[03:56.00]I don't know how fast it's going to take me to get through some of these things.
[03:59.64]But we will end it today.
[04:01.82]We are actually like an hour and a half away from the... to do literally everything.
[04:05.72]You've only streamed it three times?
[04:09.53]I've streamed it like eight times!
[04:13.89]Your fact checker is wrong!
[04:21.99]And then hey, after Chrono Trigger...
[04:25.76]Uh, we're gonna need a new late night kind of hangout game.
[04:29.24]I got a few of them that are already lined up.
[04:37.95]Is it BioShock?
[04:40.63]It is not BioShock.
[04:43.17]It is... Dracula 3.
[04:46.37]I think it's time to go back to Dracula.
[05:00.15]Probably do that early next week.
[05:02.11]Maybe this weekend.
[05:02.98]We'll see.
[05:03.20]And I don't think that's going to take necessarily weeks to do.
[05:13.10]Probably get that done in maybe like four or five streams.
[05:19.25]Maybe like three or four.
[05:19.87]How do you feel about the Oblivion remaster?
[05:28.97]I...
[05:30.66]I saw one screenshot of a goblin jumping in the air and it was not enough for me to decide if I liked it or not.
[05:37.98]It's just like, oh, there's like, alright.
[05:46.10]I'll tell you, I, I don't trust anything anymore.
[05:49.14]It's just, when it comes out, I will maybe take a look at it.
[05:58.62]Yeah.
[05:59.09]You guys, uh... We're waiting for the ad to get running here.
[06:03.65]And then we will get started.
[06:06.25]We'll be starting any minute here.
[06:12.25]He just reads any old message.
[06:13.58]What a good streamer.
[06:14.30]I mean, I wouldn't say any old message.
[06:17.70]I kind of just grab random ones out.
[06:19.46]I'm sorry, the world has eroded your trust.
[06:36.09]I don't think you did anything.
[06:45.13]You don't know that, though.
[06:55.07]No, Jerma, we need to do better.
[06:56.47]You're talking about as a chat, as a whole?
[06:58.07]Are we getting a chat?
[06:59.19]Are we getting a reformed chat now?
[07:01.33]Is that what this is?
[07:07.72]Okay.
[07:09.65]We are reforming.
[07:10.55]Yes, we're going to be reformed.
[07:12.57]Okay.
[07:16.57]Alright.
[07:17.51]Let's go.
[07:17.91]Hey, I'll do it too.
[07:21.65]I'll do it too.
[07:23.90]I'm not going to say F-U-C-K anymore.
[07:27.32]We're turning over a new leaf.
[07:29.47]I'm not going to say... I'm not going to say any bad words or anything.
[07:36.63]I'm going to drink water at least a few times during each stream.
[07:42.31]I know people get concerned about that.
[07:48.01]Cringe.
[07:51.05]Cringe family friendly streamer.
[07:58.52]Okay.
[07:59.92]Alright, let's let the ads get out of the way here.
[08:02.16]I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[08:04.40]And then we're going to start chopping onions.
[08:12.38]Alright, see you in a few minutes.
[10:50.06]Got about 25 seconds and then we can get going.
[10:54.92]How are you?
[10:56.43]How are you?
[10:59.53]Yeah, half sword.
[11:00.17]This is a game.
[11:00.73]You get swords and you run around and you hit people.
[11:09.05]Hey, sometimes I think about how sad I will be when you die.
[11:14.76]Just thought you should know.
[11:18.32]Alright, thanks.
[11:24.21]Thanks for the message.
[11:24.85]Alright, we're good.
[11:34.04]Here is half sword.
[11:35.02]Make sure I can hear it.
[11:41.86]I can.
[11:42.22]Alright, yeah, it's a game.
[11:44.98]There's a lot of damage in the game.
[11:47.21]It's a demo.
[11:48.69]I think it's a like physics based.
[11:55.05]I don't think there's any other options.
[11:56.31]I already did some settings.
[12:00.91]This game is awesome.
[12:01.93]I have seen a little bit of it.
[12:03.29]I have not looked into it very much at all.
[12:05.66]I've seen a few people play it and I go, Oh, cool.
[12:08.36]Alright.
[12:08.60]So, uh, I don't think this really matters.
[12:17.76]So what do I do with this?
[12:18.66]I know I, I'm, you can move them around.
[12:24.98]Okay, I just broke his neck.
[12:30.79]Yeah, this is a very destructive type game.
[12:34.91]Okay, so I'm on the ground.
[12:36.23]And how do you move?
[12:39.22]Alright, it's WASD.
[12:48.06]It's very sloppy.
[12:48.84]Okay.
[12:54.39]Okay.
[12:54.57]So it's left.
[12:55.65]Oh, you can like backhand people.
[12:58.75]I can't wait to do that.
[13:01.90]Alright.
[13:02.10]That's right.
[13:03.12]Holding right mouse, left mouse.
[13:08.92]You can hold both and that you can do kind of a little bit of a rage here.
[13:12.61]I do like the YMCA.
[13:27.57]Alright, so now what?
[13:31.23]Is this a sprint?
[13:32.33]Is there a jump too?
[13:32.99]Can I pick this up?
[13:35.21]No.
[13:36.84]Oh my god!
[13:37.46]There's a person here!
[13:38.18]Can I use this?
[13:41.50]Ow!

[13:55.08]Okay, that worked.
[13:57.65]Can I get his weapon?
[13:58.29]How do I get his weapon?
[14:05.03]I don't fucking care.
[14:09.78]Oh, it just hurt my arm.
[14:11.38]Did I kill myself?

[19:33.81]Put this down.
[19:34.57]What's that?

[30:37.06]I gotta... Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[30:39.28]I need to... You lose everything when you die?
[30:41.91]Oh.

[30:51.47]No, not really.
[30:52.43]Alright, let's go carnage again.
[30:55.23]Oh, I forgot there were people behind me.
[31:05.12]I'm hurt.

[31:39.03]Can I grab his leg?
[31:39.69]He's got it.
[31:45.52]I ain't done yet.
[31:47.16]It ain't over yet.
[31:56.70]This game is very fun, but it's hard.
[32:00.09]I gotta get down the movements and shit.
[32:03.77]Hold on, give me a second.
[32:04.79]Can I play this with the controller?
[32:09.37]Definitely no way.
[32:11.65]So, holding left click is my right arm.
[32:15.56]I can go horizontal.
[32:19.50]I can go vertical.
[32:23.70]If I hold the right, it's the other side.
[32:25.75]Okay.
[32:26.63]Same deal.
[32:29.51]Now, if I hold both, I go into a different stance like this.
[32:35.25]If I hold both and alt, I guess I'm...
[32:42.50]Press F, you can fart.
[32:45.52]Why'd you just lie?
[32:49.22]Let me see, I wanna see how far away I need to be.
[32:50.92]Like a punch in the face.
[32:51.80]Alright, that's... I get it.
[33:08.87]I think you just have to try to get lucky.
[33:11.34]F is slow time.
[33:19.99]Check the controls in the menu.
[33:20.79]That's a good idea.
[33:25.25]Okay.
[33:26.25]Keybinds.
[33:27.91]WSD, shift is wrong, crouch control, yep.
[33:30.27]Right hand swing, left hand swing.
[33:32.92]Right hand, oh, there's a left hand grab.
[33:36.50]Frost is right, like double tap, like tap tap right mouse button?
[33:41.33]You can sheath, swap hands, inventory, arrow time, lock on.
[33:45.43]Is it lock on?
[33:46.31]Okay.
[33:47.87]Z is lock on.
[33:52.26]Okay, so I'm locked on.
[33:53.44]Okay, that makes it way better, I think.
[33:56.26]Technically, right?
[33:58.74]Is he locked on?
[34:05.73]Damn it.
[34:07.01]I'm in trouble.
[34:10.49]I'm giving him a perfect opportunity to punch me in the face.
[34:15.97]Just get up!
[34:19.17]You gotta just hit him in the head?
[34:20.10]That's easier said than done.
[34:25.52]Wait, I'm in first person mode.
[34:29.68]That was like I got really mad.
[34:39.48]Stop, he's kicking me in the head.
[34:40.70]I don't know.
[34:53.99]Space bar is kick.
[34:55.07]Alright.
[34:56.47]Are you going to let me up?
[34:57.21]I think he's going to let me up.
[35:03.83]Run.
[35:09.63]Yeah, fuck off.
[35:11.87]Alright, now it's my turn.
[35:20.91]Got him.
[35:21.13]Alright, I can rank up right now.
[35:22.89]I actually like first person better.
[35:44.22]Die!
[35:44.58]Oh, that was his ear.
[36:14.33]Damn it.
[36:21.55]Got you in the kidney.
[36:24.66]Oh, I'm doing this double kidney shot.
[36:29.02]That's it.
[36:32.62]Alright.
[36:33.64]We got our first champion here.
[36:34.64]Great foe.
[36:36.36]Alright.
[36:36.56]I got to be very, very...
[36:42.13]I feel like I'm playing a VR game without the helmet on and it's making me scared.
[36:45.40]I need something bigger than a hammer.
[36:53.60]Good, good.
[36:54.96]Right in the kidney.
[37:02.73]I think he stuck that into my... I don't know.
[37:08.49]Shit!
[37:13.66]Fuck you!
[37:14.28]No, I'm alive.
[37:26.52]Oh!
[37:28.11]No!
[37:28.57]Oh, I have to beat this guy.
[37:31.71]This game's cool.
[37:38.64]I know, I gotta keep- I gotta kick.
[37:40.04]I wish this was in VR.
[37:42.18]I'd be doing so much better.
[37:43.02]You can dual wield?
[37:44.90]We are just ganging up on this guy.
[38:11.02]Ooh, I got him right in the neck.
[38:17.34]Good.
[38:17.52]That's it, right?
[38:23.55]What the fuck?
[38:24.17]I thought... Wasn't he down?
[38:32.07]Got him.
[38:33.23]He's dying from that.
[38:33.85]There's no way.
[38:40.99]Come on, that was a stab.
[38:50.90]Got him.
[38:52.40]Oof.
[38:57.84]Okay.
[38:59.36]Just win a fist fight and I'm good.
[39:04.02]It's impossible for me to lose these.
[39:09.06]I just Tasmanian Devil and it wins every time.
[39:17.82]Alright, now let me beat this boss.
[39:20.16]I'm walking in.
[39:21.62]I got scared.
[39:22.36]Oh, sorry.
[39:23.92]No!
[39:24.02]Get up, please!
[39:27.58]No!
[39:28.96]Please!
[39:57.98]He has an axe!
[39:59.00]How are you supposed to beat this guy?
[40:15.89]Don't hit me in the head, please!
[40:18.19]He's trying so hard to hit me in the head but he can't.
[40:21.47]He's just as bad at aiming as everybody else is.
[40:34.14]Uh-oh, I hit my head.
[40:38.72]Somebody get behind and hit him!
[40:40.54]Somebody get him from behind!
[40:41.52]It's a free kill!
[40:43.28]Somebody get him!
[40:45.32]It's a free hit!
[40:54.43]Try a different class?
[40:55.43]I think I have to beat the first boss to get a different class.
[40:59.59]Yeah, I can't pick anything else.
[41:00.75]I can only pick this thing.
[41:06.87]I can't.
[41:07.23]I'm so bad at these kind of games.
[41:09.47]Because I just go into panic mode.
[41:11.49]Even if everything is fine.
[41:12.79]That guy hit me with a stool.
[41:18.09]Fuck you.
[41:22.30]You hit me in the face with a stool.
[41:24.20]That should be illegal.
[41:25.06]Can I grab him?
[41:30.94]Get him.
[41:34.58]Get him.
[41:39.33]The guy with the stool is too powerful.
[41:42.67]It'll be plenty of time.
[41:49.23]You idiot.
[41:50.34]How?
[41:52.44]Just catch my breath.
[41:55.44]Is the guy with the stool gonna actually kick the shit out of all five of us?
[42:13.88]What even happened?
[42:16.32]What happened?
[42:17.10]I stabbed him and I got hurt.
[42:20.52]He's red on this guy.
[42:28.93]Ooh, that hurt.
[42:31.17]Ooh, right in the face.
[42:34.09]I got him right in the bridge of the nose.
[42:39.63]Good block.
[42:43.47]Oh, you motherfucker!
[42:46.34]No!
[42:51.06]Come on!
[43:02.21]Why am I sprinting at people without thinking?
[43:08.40]Okay, I guess I got this guy.
[43:10.62]Or a weapon.
[43:11.46]Alright, here we go.
[43:11.98]Fight.
[43:14.08]Good distraction.
[43:17.33]Alright, let's go, buddy.
[43:19.73]Joust!
[43:37.82]Alright, now flatten his head like a pancake.
[43:39.02]Come on.
[43:47.75]I did it.
[43:50.91]This fight, you know how we do.
[44:01.90]Shit.
[44:02.26]This guy's good.
[44:04.08]This guy's good.
[44:13.67]No!
[44:14.03]Why do you call... He keeps falling down on his own!
[44:16.37]There we go.
[44:27.23]I just quadrupled his face.
[44:41.53]Here we go.
[44:44.89]I have to think of a tactic here.
[44:46.33]Do I just charge him?
[44:49.11]What's even around me?
[44:49.97]I have an idea.
[44:51.43]Ow.
[44:54.25]I'm gonna tire him out for a second.
[44:56.75]It's definitely that.
[44:57.37]It's definitely the giant hat rack.
[44:59.51]The coat rack, whatever.
[45:08.11]You motherfucker!
[45:09.96]What the hell?! !
[45:19.39]You got a swing?
[45:20.23]I just tried and he just, he's got a giant battle axe.
[45:27.21]I have a coat rack.
[45:34.20]I wish I could just take this with me.
[45:35.20]This thing is sick.
[45:56.63]This thing is actually amazing.
[45:57.77]I wish I could take it with me.
[46:03.64]Is this guy done?
[46:08.34]Alright, let's go.
[46:10.46]Missed bite.
[46:28.14]Who's holding who here?
[46:29.04]I don't know.
[46:36.52]Am I holding him?
[46:45.21]How have I still... Okay.
[46:46.53]Alright.
[46:48.57]Bring it on.
[46:48.97]Let's go.
[46:49.41]I gotta get this situated here.
[46:50.97]Come on, man.
[46:54.57]I'm just gonna run at him and start punching, I think.
[46:56.15]Fuck it.
[46:56.45]Who cares?
[47:04.01]I got a helmet.
[47:07.63]And?
[47:08.57]Blobs.
[47:11.05]And?
[47:13.77]Nothing?
[47:14.45]It's a knife?
[47:18.88]Give it to me!
[47:19.52]Oh, come on!
[47:20.72]You fucking asshole!
[47:31.36]I tried to pick the little butcher knife up twice.
[47:34.04]I went over it.
[47:36.60]Stupid game.
[47:37.42]Hold G to keep your rank?
[47:41.91]Oh, okay.
[48:10.42]Oh, that's awful.
[48:12.59]That's so awful.
[48:13.89]That's so awful.
[48:21.86]That can happen to me just as quickly too though.
[48:35.36]Oh, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[48:36.74]Protect yourself.
[48:37.22]Right in the heart.
[48:42.35]Wait, he got me too, though.
[48:57.95]I might just do that to the boss, honestly.
[49:00.29]I think I'm gonna do that to the boss.
[49:02.46]That's what I'm gonna try.
[49:29.10]It's not going to work, guys.
[49:31.76]I didn't even hold G either.
[49:33.38]Fuck, I'm so bad at this.
[49:35.90]But I can't stop playing and I'm obsessed with it.
[49:41.06]I have to get past that first boss.
[49:52.22]Do not.
[49:52.92]Okay, thank God.
[50:00.64]Did you get me right in the eyes?
[50:02.34]You piece of shit!
[50:21.09]What's wrong with my weapon?
[50:24.90]Hold the weapon correctly!
[50:26.32]Why am I holding it backwards?
[50:33.49]You can do directional dodges with Shift?
[50:44.86]Huh.
[50:48.24]I guess you can.
[50:53.29]Shift S?
[50:58.73]I'm not dexterous enough to do this.
[51:01.98]My fingers can't like shift and S and A and it's like playing QWOP.
[51:07.06]That's why I want to use a controller.
[51:13.63]I'd be winning every fight if I had a controller in my hand.
[51:20.59]Get out of here.
[51:46.20]That's got to be it, right?
[51:46.92]Yep.
[51:47.22]Alright, let's go.
[51:50.90]How do you do an overhead swing?
[51:52.04]Yeah, I'm trying to figure it out, because when I do up and down, sometimes he just kind of like swings it around in a circle, not down.
[52:09.82]I think there's somebody in chat called Disbarrage.
[52:12.56]Alright.
[52:15.06]Now, let me... Hold on a second.
[52:16.52]Let me get up.
[52:17.17]Let me sit up.
[52:21.55]I have to lock in.
[52:22.47]How do I get past the axe?
[52:27.59]It's right click for alt hold.
[52:28.71]You don't need to hold it.
[52:30.65]Oh, okay.
[52:32.93]Walk backwards.
[52:45.46]Did I win?
[52:58.57]I did it!
[52:59.67]Yeah, you got stuck.
[53:06.04]Oh, what's this?
[53:06.52]Is this your axe?
[53:08.38]Oh!
[53:08.50]Remember all the times you did this to me?
[53:10.28]No!
[53:30.62]I unlocked peasant.
[53:32.38]Yeah, let's go.
[53:38.20]Cool.
[53:38.62]Alright, so you start with better gear as a peasant.
[53:45.82]Randomize gear.
[53:48.88]Oh, I definitely want the thing.
[53:50.42]I want this thing.
[53:51.64]I'm going to bury this directly into somebody's head.
[53:54.74]If you die, you have to go back to Beggar.
[53:56.52]Are you serious?
[54:04.40]Okay.
[54:05.30]So I should hold G if I think I'm going to die.
[54:10.18]If I think I'm dead, just hold G. Oh boy.
[54:15.71]Alright, let me practice a little bit here.
[54:18.75]So this is the default.
[54:20.87]You hold it above like this.
[54:21.97]Ooh.
[54:23.65]Alright.
[54:23.90]You can just get little, little slaps, a little slaps in the head.
[54:28.96]Yep.
[54:29.40]Little slaps, little slaps in the face.
[54:35.00]Alright.
[54:35.22]So let me figure out the vertical.
[54:36.38]Cause if I go up and then down, sometimes it just, okay.
[54:41.44]It's gotta be like a perfect up and down.
[54:51.71]Like that.
[54:52.41]It's got to be like up and then straight down.
[54:56.87]Yeah, and yeah, like somebody said, you have to let it stabilize first.
[55:00.28]So when it's in the air, you can't just like like I was doing.
[55:04.70]If you want to swing your weight down.
[55:07.47]Oh yeah.
[55:09.19]Wait.
[55:10.62]Wham.
[55:11.60]Wait.
[55:12.32]Wham.
[55:13.50]Okay, so that's the default.
[55:14.54]So if I press right click, it switches to kind of like bicep curls.
[55:20.16]Or like a push.
[55:22.50]Which then you can kind of go like, eh?
[55:25.41]Like, excuse me?
[55:26.13]I mean, I could also do Star Wars kid thing and just... It would work a little bit, wouldn't it?
[55:38.10]You can do a little bit of an excuse me.
[55:39.32]You can just whomp.
[55:40.58]A little bit of a whomp.
[55:41.54]A little whomp.
[55:45.97]So what if I hold both?
[55:47.75]Holding both does the same thing.
[55:49.45]Alright.
[55:51.37]So you're really just tapping right mouse to change your set here.
[55:55.97]But what about holding alt?
[55:57.77]Holding alt turns it into like a little... You can keep people away from you.
[56:05.18]I don't think I'm ever going to be using Alt that much.
[56:06.54]I'm going to be going for overhead.
[56:08.76]Whams.
[56:13.00]Press X while you hold it.
[56:15.36]Oh, okay.
[56:15.78]So I can change the way you hold it.
[56:23.47]And then you want to hit X here.
[56:25.03]That way.
[56:25.69]X. That way.
[56:27.37]And then it doesn't matter for overhead.
[56:29.11]But you want to get it to stabilize.
[56:30.79]And then whack.
[56:32.33]Oh, hold on.
[56:32.73]That's not stable.
[56:34.07]Whack.
[56:37.14]And then kick.
[56:40.54]Let's go.
[56:44.10]Single combat.
[56:51.34]I fucked up.
[56:51.76]How did I fuck it up already?
[56:52.84]What?
[56:54.20]Why did that not work?
[56:56.16]What?
[56:57.42]I did the exact same thing I just did to the dummy.
[56:59.84]And he like went.
[57:01.90]What the hell?
[57:12.00]It's because I got stabbed?
[57:14.18]No, I went like this, like... That's horse shit.
[57:26.81]I'm addicted to this fucking game.
[57:36.03]No, wait, that's part of it?
[57:37.37]Wait, that was part of it.
[57:41.21]Oh, I thought I was just, it just threw me into like the, the free mode thing that I did before.
[57:46.48]Like the abyss or whatever.
[57:48.80]Oh, I could have won.
[57:49.68]Well, it didn't tell me that.
[57:55.46]The only thing the game has told me is hold G to continue.
[57:57.96]Turn and leave from this path.
[58:02.50]It be too late.
[58:14.69]Let's cause fucking mayhem.
[58:15.87]I'll be fine.
[58:32.56]Yep, this guy's in the way.
[58:50.22]Get him?
[58:50.84]Alright, now give me that weapon.
[58:56.26]I thought you were down.
[59:00.73]I'll get peasant back.
[59:01.43]Go.
[59:01.55]More.
[59:01.77]More.
[59:02.05]More.
[59:28.40]Oh, that was right in his neck.
[59:36.21]Okay, well I- he- he just- okay.
[59:56.75]What am I looking at?
[59:57.45]Okay.
[59:58.51]Champion time.
[60:04.34]Let's go.
[60:04.56]You know what we're going to do?
[60:06.96]He's going to get stuck.
[60:26.42]No, please!
[60:34.45]How did he cut my leg off?
[60:35.87]He didn't even swing!
[60:52.57]How?
[60:53.29]What are you even trying to hit that guy?
[61:35.23]he doesn't know where to look this guy's using like an energy beam on him the guy's using like he's using the power of vibrations
[61:50.77]That was a weird move and it screwed everything up.
[61:53.17]Please knock him down.
[61:56.55]Please knock him down.
[62:02.42]Get up!
[62:03.80]Move!
[62:04.00]Ugh!
[62:20.47]My arms are both broken.
[62:26.24]I can't do anything.
[62:33.44]Oh, this game is going to drive me crazy.
[62:35.86]It's so fun, but it's like too much.
[62:41.44]Okay, I'm just Knuckles from Sonic the Hedgehog.
[62:49.62]I'm fine.
[62:54.57]Oh, that had to hurt.
[63:08.39]How do you fall over like that?
[63:09.79]These guys, their legs are made out of fucking Play-Doh.
[63:16.10]Put your hands up and block!
[63:30.75]I'm alright.
[63:36.34]I'm still fine.
[63:38.78]Great.
[63:40.04]That's wonderful.
[63:40.93]Now I can't get up.
[63:45.07]I actually can't get up.
[63:54.18]That shouldn't be funny, but it is, somehow.
[64:27.29]Damn it.
[64:27.85]I can't help it.
[64:28.69]I have to keep playing it.
[64:36.98]No, give that to me.
[64:38.50]Give me it.
[64:38.86]Give me it.
[64:40.98]Give that to me!
[64:47.12]Your heart's stuck in bronze?
[64:48.46]I know.
[64:49.72]I want to get out of bronze so bad.
[64:56.09]Great coming up.
[64:58.21]Yeah, in like a few minutes.
[65:03.10]I'll try this for another like hour or so.
[65:04.98]I really want to get better at it.
[65:06.72]Is there an emote?
[65:18.78]He's like, it's going to be alright.
[65:21.90]It's going to be alright, buddy.
[65:38.03]I'm trying to grab the... Thank god everybody sucks.
[65:40.99]What just happened?
[66:31.16]You fucking asshole!
[66:33.82]Alright, I got it.
[66:43.53]Alright, we're gonna take a break.
[66:57.15]I'm ready.
[66:58.75]Right before the break, I'm gonna get this real quick.
[67:18.66]Good.
[67:18.80]Alright.
[67:20.01]I'm ready to fight the boss when I get back.
[67:21.21]Alright.
[67:22.89]Ads are going to start in like 30 seconds.
[67:26.42]I'll be back in like three minutes.
[67:27.46]I'm going to get water.
[67:28.20]This game is crazy.
[67:29.84]It's very fun though.
[67:31.53]Be right back.
[71:54.85]What's going on?
[71:55.47]About 10 seconds.
[71:59.67]This game is fun.
[72:02.17]This is just a demo too.
[72:14.92]You can just grab it.
[72:18.90]It's pretty cool for a demo.
[72:23.00]Plug a controller in?
[72:24.12]Can I actually do a controller?
[72:28.04]Welcome back, everybody.
[72:28.82]Alright, it's time to fight the champion, and that's for me to get to peasant mode.
[72:33.13]Okay.
[72:36.63]I got an iced tea here.
[72:37.37]I'm good.
[72:40.27]The game gets hard as you go.
[72:41.27]The AI ramps up really fast.
[72:42.87]Alright, let's go.
[72:45.45]I got something.
[72:55.42]Don't.
[72:55.84]Okay, hold on.
[72:58.92]Can I use it as a shield?
[73:03.05]Oh.
[73:04.65]No, you idiot.
[73:05.81]I wanted to pick the other weapon up.
[73:16.18]Okay.
[73:19.20]I got him in the side.
[73:23.18]He's just got so much reach.
[73:28.11]I gotta go for a stab right in the chest.
[73:37.77]I got him in the leg!
[73:38.83]I got him in the leg!
[73:44.37]Nice.
[73:48.47]Alright, finally.
[73:50.29]Back to peasant.
[73:58.12]Alright, let's go.
[73:59.28]I know exactly what I'm doing.
[74:01.84]What gear?
[74:02.36]Maybe I should take the shovel instead.
[74:03.87]Is that a shovel?
[74:04.43]Is that a spear?
[74:08.97]Oh, this thing looks kind of good.
[74:18.50]This thing is actually better.
[74:32.16]Okay, up, down, up, down, up, down.
[74:35.26]I don't know how I... because the last time I did it, I went like this.
[74:43.40]But I swear I went up, down, up, down, up, down.
[74:46.84]I swear.
[74:47.28]I'm going to play this tomorrow and beat it to show how bad you are.
[74:52.29]Good luck.
[74:53.77]Hey, good luck.
[74:54.97]See you when you get to the same level that I'm at right now.
[74:57.45]And you don't beat it.
[74:58.49]And then you don't tell anybody because who is holding you accountable?
[75:02.44]Nobody.
[75:05.48]You could come in here and lose 50 times to the first enemy and then come in here and say that you did it.
[75:18.06]Rent free.
[75:20.05]That guy's rent free in my head.
[75:22.35]Okay.
[75:22.83]I think I'm going to go carnage.
[75:25.35]A single combat I'm not ready for yet.
[75:26.85]Let's go.
[75:31.21]There's too many people looking at me.
[75:43.53]Ooh, I think I just knocked him into fucking Thursday.
[75:50.53]Nice job!
[75:52.22]Too bad it was your fucking downfall.
[75:53.64]Alright, good.
[76:04.79]Uh, single combat or we're going to do... Ah, shit.
[76:10.99]I gotta get... I gotta go for spoilants here.
[76:14.53]Oh, turn the game back up.
[76:15.67]Sorry.
[76:24.35]You... No!
[76:27.45]Please keep fighting each other.
[76:28.47]That guy just got me with the tip of that.
[76:32.72]I'm alright.
[76:35.34]No, my teeth are all fucked up.
[76:37.26]No!
[76:37.78]He won't get over it.
[76:39.74]He won't get over it.
[76:43.20]Wait!
[76:47.02]Okay, that's fine.
[76:49.93]We're good.
[76:55.87]Alright, let these idiots fight each other.
[77:05.25]I don't care.
[77:06.51]And I'm gonna clap them with the fucking oven mitt.
[77:15.55]What am I looking at?
[77:16.63]Stop looking at random shit.
[77:20.75]I just knocked myself out.
[77:22.81]No, no, give up, give up, give up.
[77:26.09]Shit.
[77:29.70]I just went head first into the ground.
[77:40.10]Pick it up.
[77:42.79]I want that chair so bad.
[77:54.76]I always gotta run for the chair.
[78:01.92]Dude!
[78:02.60]I thought he was gonna get hit.
[78:07.64]I'm fine.
[78:09.29]No!
[78:09.47]Come on!
[78:18.23]I'm still fine.
[78:25.94]I think I hit him.
[78:27.28]Ow.
[78:31.30]That was me or him?
[78:32.30]Me or you?
[78:33.10]Me or you?
[78:33.47]I think it was him.
[78:34.19]I think that's his blood all over me.
[78:37.95]Or was that me?
[78:39.23]Was it me?
[78:41.96]Here's me.
[78:59.94]This game is fucking so hard.
[79:03.64]Like, I had a pitchfork and I... The controls are sloppy as shit.
[79:12.70]Like, what do you want me to do?
[79:27.67]Come on!
[79:40.44]Aiming the mouse is just like... God, I wish I could just put on a fucking bodysuit and just do this.
[79:53.19]Oh man.
[79:57.91]Turn your sensitivity down?
[79:58.97]I don't think that's it.
[80:13.39]Let's go.
[80:16.29]Is it my sensitivity being too high?
[80:17.73]I feel like it's already really low.
[80:18.81]I guess not.
[80:20.33]Maybe a little bit lower?
[80:41.29]I guess that is actually a little bit better.
[80:44.72]Imagine getting hit with a full bodysuit.
[80:49.97]Alright, let's go.
[80:50.83]Fuck this.
[81:07.48]How is anybody going to die from this?
[81:09.89]Ooh, I got you right in the neck.
[81:13.47]And then...
[81:19.37]I think I got one.
[81:27.52]Get off.
[81:28.86]Get off me.
[81:30.18]Get off me.
[81:33.16]I don't want to fight anybody.
[81:36.41]Just kidding.
[81:53.62]oh not done small what is it wait it's a 3v3 I've got to be careful I don't want to hit anybody
[82:21.55]Like, the thing is covering my eyes.
[82:22.84]Get the leg.
[82:42.67]Get the leg.
[82:43.95]Get the leg!
[82:45.41]Got him.
[82:49.91]Alright, how you guys doing?
[82:51.09]Good?
[82:53.31]Let me know if you need to tag in.
[83:09.37]Good.
[83:09.85]Finish him off.
[83:12.81]Nice job.
[83:18.85]One more.
[83:32.62]Careful!
[83:33.12]Careful!
[83:33.50]Stop!
[83:33.92]Stop!
[83:34.20]You're gonna hit me.
[83:34.74]Just shove him under the rug.
[83:48.90]Shove him under the rug like fucking dust under the couch.
[83:51.00]Okay, let's do single combat.
[84:24.90]I'm just hitting him in the head.
[84:26.10]Okay, I got him.
[84:29.18]Bravestand?
[84:29.86]It's me versus everybody.
[84:31.09]What do you got?
[84:32.07]No!
[84:56.36]I'm made out of metal, though.
[84:57.59]What's up, clown?
[85:01.45]Oh, just you now.
[85:14.14]Alright.
[85:16.04]Get that out of here.
[85:28.08]I'm okay.
[85:28.70]I'm okay.
[85:29.50]I'm okay.
[85:29.86]I'm okay.
[85:36.16]I'm okay.
[85:43.99]I think that was my head.
[85:59.76]Coward!
[86:01.44]You're a coward!
[86:02.14]I'm swinging, you're doing nothing!
[86:27.49]Do you think people, when they got this close, were just talking shit to each other?
[86:29.85]What do you think was going on here?
[86:40.48]Just heavy breathing?
[86:41.30]Alright.
[86:44.06]I think I'm, uh... This one was really fun.
[86:49.14]But I think I've seen a lot of what I want to see.
[86:50.86]It was great, though.
[86:52.98]This is just a demo.
[86:54.10]You can just play it right now.
[86:56.48]I like the progression system.
[86:57.48]I think the roguelike feature is cool.
[86:59.62]I'm just not... I just can't do it.
[87:01.86]It's good though.
[87:02.56]I like it a lot.
[87:04.06]Look at this guy with his little fucking can opener.
[87:05.86]You gonna open a can of beans with that or are you gonna hurt me?
[87:14.81]Hey, what are you gonna open up a can of beans with that?
[87:20.95]Watch him die!
[87:32.40]Hello, my baby.
[87:33.18]Hello, my honey.
[87:34.02]Hello, my ragtime doll.
[87:35.78]Send me a kiss, my boy.
[87:37.49]Baby, my heart's on fire.
[87:39.15]And if you refuse me, then you will lose me.
[87:41.03]And you'll be left alone.
[87:42.10]And then, honey, honey, you are born.
[88:08.72]Hooray!
[88:13.44]Alright, one more and then we'll move on to the next one.
[88:28.87]Coward!
[88:53.61]Oh, excellent work.
[88:54.63]Excellent footwork.
[88:57.13]Yeah, that looked really cool.
[88:59.29]Do you think you could teach me that one day, Sire?
[89:02.47]I'm just a lowly squire.
[89:03.55]Look at that.
[89:08.59]We're going to play Cloverpit next.
[89:10.64]It's another demo.
[89:17.62]This one's like a slot machine one.
[89:20.86]Looked very interesting.
[89:21.70]I wanted to play it.
[89:24.85]I thought you were addicted to this one.
[89:25.97]I mean, I was until I skipped everything.
[89:31.03]I got to peasant rank.
[89:31.93]That's that's pretty good, right?
