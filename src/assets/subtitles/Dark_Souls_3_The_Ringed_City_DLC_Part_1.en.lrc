[ve:60.16.100]

[00:52.73]Look at that.
[00:54.23]7 PM.
[00:56.17]We just... 7 PM.
[00:58.07]We just started.
[01:00.93]Welcome.
[01:02.15]Hi.
[01:04.67]Where's the on-time streamer emote?
[01:06.45]That's a good... Where is the on-time streamer emote?
[01:11.33]What?
[01:15.66]Yeah, I'm gonna do Dark Souls 3 tonight.
[01:18.60]The downloadable content, the downloadable zone...
[01:21.65]With all kinds of surprises, you know how I love surprises.
[01:30.60]On time.
[01:34.06]There isn't one because it would never get used.
[01:37.33]You know, that is true.
[01:39.67]But it would be a pretty rare emote.
[01:43.65]This universe sim is boring.
[01:48.95]Actually, it's 7.01.
[01:49.91]I started at like 6.59.
[01:51.87]I can't wait for streamer to suck.
[01:56.81]I know.
[01:59.01]Although, I'm pretty good at Dark Souls.
[02:01.60]You guys have seen my Dark Souls streams.
[02:03.08]I'm pretty good at this game.
[02:05.72]Come on.
[02:06.90]Give a guy a break.
[02:10.28]So, I'm not going to waste much time.
[02:14.12]I already have it open.
[02:15.74]The only problem with...
[02:17.88]Downloading Dark Souls DLC.
[02:20.27]Is... I have to remember how to play the game.
[02:23.29]That happen to everybody else?
[02:26.31]You just forget how to fucking play.
[02:29.51]Yeah, you wait like two or three months in between playing these games.
[02:33.57]I'm gonna have to get used to it again.
[02:34.71]And we're gonna get used to it by... I think I'm very underleveled, by the way.
[02:39.69]For this area that's coming up.
[02:41.77]Wait, what?
[02:43.55]Yes, you have in fact found the right channel.
[02:45.39]This is the channel that has beaten Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[02:51.43]This DLC is going to kick my ass.
[02:53.13]Oh god, I can't wait.
[02:55.91]Can't wait for that, but let's just go over to it.
[02:58.92]I should be so level 100, so I'm a little underleveled.
[03:04.82]I'm fairly underleveled, I believe.
[03:08.32]But we're going to do something really quickly.
[03:11.15]I want to make sure that the game is in sync.
[03:12.71]Because this happens sometimes with Dark Souls.
[03:15.91]Is my voice and the game audio in sync?
[03:19.41]When I'm swinging at stuff.
[03:21.51]Like I'm swinging.
[03:25.38]Is the sound in sync?
[03:27.06]Because we had this problem last time I played this game.
[03:35.37]How we doing?
[03:38.35]It's good?
[03:39.29]It's in sync?
[03:40.67]Okay.
[03:43.09]Alright.
[03:44.25]Let's be rusty and just go get our ass kicked.
[03:46.32]I believe I know how to get there.
[03:50.64]And it's this way.
[03:54.02]I think I can just go to kill into the first flame.
[03:57.88]I believe this is a way to get in.
[03:59.86]By the way, in case you were wondering, of course there's going to be spoilers.
[04:05.56]Like, if you have never played Dark Souls 3 and you're like, oh shit, what is this?
[04:09.56]Is this a bonfire?
[04:10.54]Yeah, this is going to be spoilers here.
[04:12.40]This bonfire is in this game.
[04:14.95]So, there it is.
[04:17.85]This is a new bonfire.
[04:18.79]This is not here.
[04:19.43]Travel to the Dreg Heap.
[04:22.65]So I guess we're going to travel to the land of dirty laundry.
[04:27.25]Take a look at that.
[04:28.65]Hey, Dreg Heap, huh?
[04:30.33]We're going to travel to somebody's dirty laundry.
[04:33.84]First joke of the evening and he nailed it.
[04:45.30]There are trees in the game?
[04:46.20]Yeah, there are.
[04:49.83]Okay.
[04:51.87]Here we are.
[04:56.19]Why is this running like shit?
[04:57.43]Alright, gotta be thorough.
[05:05.55]Check for invisible doors.
[05:08.02]Okay.
[05:09.88]Uh-oh.
[05:10.92]This is kind of running like shit.
[05:12.14]Why?
[05:14.20]Why is this running so poorly?
[05:19.58]NPC?
[05:22.54]Oh, the DLC has some performance issues?
[05:24.08]Okay, well, good to know.
[05:29.26]I thought that clamoring tin can was the last.
[05:33.33]Well, here we go again.
[05:34.43]Mm-hmm.
[05:36.07]What is it you want from this old stone-out hag?
[05:40.47]Stupid.
[05:40.89]I've nothing for you, not a smithereen.
[05:43.69]Wait, what?
[05:44.65]Oh, Slytherin.
[05:45.37]I'd just like to stand here and take in the view.
[05:49.95]So she's kind of like, uh, you're of Londor?
[05:53.01]I have business with you.
[05:53.97]Wait, what?
[05:56.06]I love how it's, I have business with you, or no business in particular.
[06:01.00]I have business with you.
[06:01.76]Not a smithereen.
[06:02.90]Okay, well, you obviously lied to me, because you have a bunch of shit.
[06:08.42]Splitleaf Greatsword, what is this?
[06:25.26]C for strength.
[06:26.42]This is a dex character.
[06:29.46]Okay, well, we got a lot of shit.
[06:32.46]Divine blessing, hidden blessing, rusted coin.
[06:36.44]Interesting.
[06:37.70]Should I just boot her off the fucking cliff?
[06:41.41]Should I just, like... Hey!
[06:46.17]Oh, yeah, thanks for all the stuff.
[06:48.83]Get out!
[06:49.61]Oh!
[06:51.52]I just broke her chair.
[06:55.36]Yeah, fuck you.
[06:56.16]Now you're going to go build a new one from Ikea.
[07:00.16]Okay, well you can sell things too.
[07:04.86]I don't think I really have much to sell.
[07:11.19]Whatever, let's just go.
[07:13.11]Time to read what people have to say.
[07:14.29]Read message.
[07:15.21]Take the plunge.
[07:16.97]Not yet.
[07:18.15]We're completionists when we play Dark Souls.
[07:25.75]Bet you didn't fucking know about this secret area.
[07:27.61]Bet you didn't know about that fucking secret.
[07:42.68]Yeah.
[07:43.80]Yeah, don't worry about it.
[07:53.99]I feel like I'm rolling slow.
[07:55.13]That's gonna change.
[07:57.14]Let's go over here.
[07:58.78]And fight this guy.
[08:04.86]I just need to get a feel for the game again.
[08:06.32]And I don't think this is a fully upgraded weapon.
[08:09.16]Which would probably be a huge mistake.
[08:10.48]Let me just see.
[08:13.28]No, it's a plus ten.
[08:13.96]Okay.
[08:14.24]This one's making sure.
[08:16.47]I have the wiki open.
[08:17.45]I do not have the wiki open.
[08:19.49]Oh, fuck.
[08:21.13]Huh?
[08:22.61]This guy.
[08:27.63]Big guy with a fucking bee's nest.
[08:30.25]No, bird's nest.
[08:31.47]Did I say bee's nest?
[08:39.33]It'd be so funny if there was a family of birds inside of him.
[08:47.05]That takes a lot of hits though.
[08:49.93]I feel like that hurts.
[08:59.32]Oh, it does.
[09:00.17]It does hurt.
[09:01.29]It hurts.
[09:02.45]It hurts a lot, actually.
[09:04.75]Let's top ourselves off.
[09:11.43]I'm terrified of this area.
[09:16.88]Let's just finish him.
[09:25.70]Oh, thank God it was such a tiny little drop.
[09:29.66]Thank goodness And after a little while that took a long time to kill you Titanite chunk from just killing one of these guys.
[09:42.98]Alright.
[09:43.32]Well, I guess we're just gonna go this way Titanite chunk Now I guess I'm like 10 levels too low for this place So we're gonna have to be very careful
[10:03.11]This is a really cool area, though.
[10:06.34]Are we in rat mode right now?
[10:07.32]Are we in sub-rat mode?
[10:08.98]Alright.
[10:11.76]Aquamarine Dagger.
[10:14.98]Ooh.
[10:16.58]What is that?
[10:18.91]It's a faith weapon?
[10:20.19]A magic weapon?
[10:24.43]It's a crystal blade.
[10:25.19]Release magic from the aquamarine crystals, creating a fleeting blue crystal blade.
[10:32.17]I just want to see what it looks like.
[10:33.09]That's, like, fairly cool looking.
[10:37.13]Oh, that is cool.
[10:39.45]What does it do?
[10:42.40]Ooh!
[10:42.62]Okay, this shit is actually really cool.
[10:51.41]Too bad I can't use it.
[10:54.29]Well, let's get going.
[10:57.61]Wait, what?! !
[10:59.43]I think, like, falling off that other edge just, like, gave me... fucked up with my brain.
[11:04.47]My brain doesn't understand.
[11:05.37]I think that's it for over there.
[11:07.15]Let's go to the right.
[11:12.90]There's bloodstain.
[11:13.58]Yeah, you died by the big fat guy.
[11:15.02]Yeah, I didn't.
[11:16.40]That means I'm better than this player.
[11:20.12]It's like a magic lightsaber.
[11:21.78]That's cool.
[11:23.48]Alright, let's go.
[11:28.34]Uh, there's where I fell.
[11:31.49]Kind of want to go back up here just to make sure I didn't lose anything.
[11:39.79]Just got very bright very quickly.
[11:42.37]This doesn't seem right.
[11:45.36]Uh, why is this here?
[11:50.06]Oh.
[11:51.66]Okay.
[11:57.16]That's why it's here.
[12:02.50]back it up back it up gentlemen yeah let's try I'm gonna get like three people in a row here this is gonna be amazing alright and then count three I want everybody in the chat I want you to write back it up gentlemen alright ready one two three back it up okay no no we're not doing that again
[12:28.79]Okay, stop fucking around.
[12:30.05]This is not an area to fuck around in.
[12:37.71]We can't get attached to another fucking stupid joke like that.
[12:40.94]I'm not gonna get attached to that.
[12:44.52]Why do I always make you guys on the count of three say, like, a phrase?
[12:49.26]This doesn't make very much sense.
[12:50.46]Alright, watch this.
[12:54.67]Somebody's gonna come behind me and push me.
[12:57.58]Not to this guy.
[13:04.10]What?
[13:06.41]Uh... Okay.
[13:11.35]Oh, shit.
[13:15.29]Night-night scale.
[13:17.22]Oh!
[13:18.56]Oh!
[13:27.57]Am I going to do a password for bosses?
[13:29.82]We have a rule here where I have to try to attempt to fight the boss at least like five or six times before I'd even remotely decide that I'm going to have any co-op.
[13:38.78]I like to do it by myself.
[13:41.02]Like a big boy.
[13:43.20]But in the case of me not being able to... Whoa!
[13:45.73]What the fuck is that thing?
[13:49.77]In the case of me not being able to beat a boss, then... Oh, yeah.
[13:54.31]For the sake of like... I can't even speak.
[13:56.85]Hold on.
[14:00.86]Get up, gentlemen.
[14:02.38]These guys kind of just keep coming at it.
[14:03.90]Please, riddle the game.
[14:04.82]I'm almost out of fucking apple juice.
[14:08.50]This is not good.
[14:11.36]How am I turning invisible when I roll?
[14:13.02]I have the ring on that allows me to do that.
[14:16.99]What the fuck is this?
[14:19.17]Here he comes.
[14:19.61]Here comes the fucking Luigi's Mansion ghost.
[14:25.39]Watch out.
[14:27.91]Make sure you got enough vacuum battery power.
[14:34.55]Where did he go?
[14:39.26]He was just up there.
[14:41.96]He's invisible?
[14:42.50]I don't understand.
[14:46.08]Take the plunge.
[14:47.60]Whoa!
[14:48.06]Whoa.
[14:51.80]What is that?
[14:52.68]Take the plunge?
[14:55.44]Should I listen to the fucking video game person?
[14:58.57]Oh shit, that's definitely the boss.
[15:00.79]Oh god, I have one flask.
[15:02.37]Let's go.
[15:15.92]Well, okay.
[15:22.70]Take the plunge.
[15:25.87]That's just great.
[15:30.37]Wrong plunge.
[15:32.27]Also, hey, thank you to ThatGuyTag2.
[15:35.73]The CIA are your biggest fans.
[15:37.16]They've watched all your streams, but they don't consider you... I'm an idiot, so I'm not a danger to anybody.
[15:42.70]Well, that's good, because I'm as harmless as they come.
[15:45.64]But thank you for the $10.
[15:46.78]That guy tagged, too.
[15:48.63]And Griff779 gave $50.
[15:50.33]They say, Hey, Jeremiah, first time watching your stream live.
[15:54.89]Thanks for all the awesome content.
[15:55.93]My life has been in the crapper this past year, but your videos have kept me from going insane some days again.
[16:02.14]Thank you.
[16:02.42]Have a nice night.
[16:03.02]Well, Griff...
[16:04.79]You have a nice night.
[16:06.17]Hopefully you enjoy the streams.
[16:08.13]Thank you so much.
[16:10.60]And if your life's been in the crapper, I hope shit gets better for you.
[16:13.36]I really do.
[16:19.08]Now let's... Figure this out.
[16:23.54]Take the plunge.
[16:24.46]Where was I supposed to go?
[16:25.50]Like, right here?
[16:26.40]Okay.
[16:32.00]I guess I was just supposed to do that.
[16:35.28]I found a secret.
[16:36.00]So if I- can I go down here now?
[16:38.78]Is it gonna hurt me?
[16:40.50]I guess not.
[16:42.41]Alright.
[16:45.51]Those guys are all gonna spawn again, though.
[16:48.23]Thank god they're not.
[16:55.41]Alright, so I just fall down here.
[17:00.27]There's probably something I can do, too.
[17:04.30]Guess not.
[17:05.40]Okay, whatever.
[17:06.18]And then if he's out here, right?
[17:08.64]I'm going to run by these guys, or most of them.
[17:11.82]Here we go.
[17:15.22]Not being followed.
[17:16.06]I kind of am being followed, but it's alright.
[17:19.06]I got my blood echoes, which is good.
[17:20.34]I don't want you to screw this up so you can die.
[17:27.05]Alright, so take the plunge.
[17:28.29]He means like right there.
[17:30.45]Well, look where he's pointing.
[17:32.21]He's not pointing in the right direction.
[17:36.63]Oh, shit.
[17:36.93]This is such a narrow spot.
[17:42.34]How long does he do this for?
[17:43.60]How long do you do this shit for, man?
[17:46.58]Huh?
[17:48.14]Okay.
[17:48.60]Let's take a look at our surroundings.
[17:52.30]Over there, straight ahead.
[17:53.79]Item.
[17:58.75]Good.
[18:00.35]Lightning urn.
[18:03.42]Should I even remotely try to go that way?
[18:06.66]Sniper.
[18:07.94]Ring ahead.
[18:08.64]Guess there's a new ring over there.
[18:11.80]Should I go for it?
[18:16.46]Ring ahead.
[18:20.36]Uh...
[18:27.53]I got the ring!
[18:29.80]I got the ring!
[18:30.38]Alright, I got the ring.
[18:31.14]I got the ring.
[18:31.56]That's all I care about.
[18:32.86]Fuck, I gotta come back here.
[18:37.46]At least I got the ring.
[18:39.18]What is that ring?
[18:45.06]What was the point of getting this ring?
[18:50.83]Ring of Sacrifice?
[18:51.73]What was it called?
[18:52.23]Something plus three?
[18:53.11]Ring of Steel Protection plus three?
[18:59.89]Increases physical damage absorption.
[19:02.67]I mean, this thing sucks.
[19:05.39]Why do I have this on?
[19:06.03]Should I just wear this?
[19:15.76]Because, I mean, that ring I had on was terrible.
[19:19.50]I wonder if I should just have that on, because Pontiff's right eye is awful.
[19:25.32]I'll keep it on.
[19:27.52]And we've got another $50 bit donation here.
[19:32.17]From KXZ501.
[19:33.11]Gives $50.
[19:33.91]It says, my granddad always used to say, as one door closes, another one opens.
[19:38.93]Lovely fellow.
[19:40.97]He was a fucking submarine captain?
[19:46.91]Hey, well, your grandfather had some great advice.
[19:48.31]That's true.
[19:49.27]One door closes, another one opens.
[19:52.59]But thank you, KXZ, for the $50.
[19:55.69]Thank you.
[19:57.70]Generous, generous people giving generous amounts of money to watch a guy fall off a cliff in Dark Souls 3.
[20:05.35]Thank you.
[20:06.67]Thank you.
[20:07.63]Hold on.
[20:08.45]One second.
[20:11.09]Move this.
[20:12.25]Bring this up.
[20:13.74]There we go.
[20:17.53]Uh, sub-only mode?
[20:19.23]The reason I believe it is in sub-only mode is because with Dark Souls, um, people can just tell me, like, where things are.
[20:26.08]And, like, where to go, and, like, exactly what to do.
[20:28.44]And I kinda like to just not be able to, I kinda like to just explore.
[20:32.38]That's what it was when I first got Dark Souls 3, so I'm assuming maybe one of the mods decided to do it like that, at least initially.
[20:39.81]You know, because if somebody was to just tell me, like, hey, Jerma, the first boss, like, slices penis off, that's how you instantly kill him.
[20:45.26]It's like, okay, well, now I'm going to do that.
[20:47.16]I didn't, like, really want to know, like, what am I doing?
[20:49.06]Let's go.
[20:50.30]I didn't really want to know that I could do that.
[20:51.76]This guy gets fucked up every time.
[20:54.97]Uh, right up here.
[21:07.96]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[21:09.48]God damn it!
[21:10.16]Get out of here, Luigi!
[21:12.56]I hate those fucking Mario Universe enemies.
[21:18.96]All they need to go is... What's the noise they make?
[21:21.23]Mario enemies?
[21:22.19]Ghosts?
[21:23.43]It's like... I can't do it.
[21:28.79]You know what?
[21:29.15]Speed that up.
[21:30.05]If you go... Speed that up a shitload and make it a little bit pitch higher, that's what it sounds like.
[21:42.95]Loud noises of the DLC, I don't really.
[21:45.11]Hey, thanks!
[21:45.69]What's the move, boys?
[21:47.89]For your $10?
[21:48.25]Thank you.
[21:51.80]I have to get this.
[21:54.52]Right here.
[21:54.82]All I have to do is bait this out, right?
[21:56.68]Come on, shoot me.
[21:57.44]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[22:01.96]God!
[22:02.14]Didn't even get hit.
[22:06.96]We're good.
[22:07.22]Keep going.
[22:08.70]We're here.
[22:14.78]New spot.
[22:15.86]Oh, no, not these shitheads.
[22:20.08]Alright, let's try to remember how to parry enemies, because we have to do it to... Oh, that one guy has a spear.
[22:24.77]I fucking hate spear enemies.
[22:27.79]What is he doing?
[22:28.75]That's a new thing.
[22:29.83]Oh, he's just a magician.
[22:30.81]It's okay.
[22:34.30]Really?
[22:34.56]Get the fuck out of here.
[22:38.18]He is going to stab me with that spear, ain't he?
[22:43.77]Can I bring one of you guys outside?
[22:44.99]I don't want to fight you in this tiny room.
[22:48.23]Ow.
[22:50.37]There's three people over here?
[22:52.85]What the fuck?
[22:53.73]I don't want to fight three of these guys at the same time.
[23:02.67]Come on, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!
[23:08.13]You!
[23:11.29]You!
[23:11.43]I'm in the corner!
[23:12.52]I'm in the- Where am I?
[23:16.10]Stop!
[23:17.66]I'm getting a fucking laser beam!
[23:20.99]Where am I going?
[23:21.67]It's too loud.
[23:23.01]It's too loud.
[23:23.61]I don't want to... Hold on a second.
[23:30.67]Just get it!
[23:37.02]Okay, calm the fuck down, dude.
[23:39.82]Calm down.
[23:41.38]It's just a guy with a staff.
[23:43.10]Why am I so on edge right now?
[23:44.77]This is not even that hard.
[23:46.09]I'm like so on edge.
[23:56.26]This is what happens when you don't fucking play this game.
[23:58.70]You didn't hit him in the back.
[24:00.92]What the fuck are you talking about?
[24:02.36]FromSoftware.
[24:03.56]God, I'm so underleveled.
[24:08.79]That's my excuse for this whole thing, guys.
[24:13.31]Back it up.
[24:13.75]Back it up.
[24:14.11]Back it up.
[24:14.75]Don't let this fucking idiot kill you.
[24:16.21]Don't let this fucking idiot kill you.
[24:17.75]He's so easy.
[24:23.88]What?
[24:25.66]Why is your shield like... Not this time.
[24:31.18]Not this time, buddy.
[24:35.03]I'm telling you, spear enemies are the bane of my existence in these games.
[24:46.57]Lothric Knight Elm, Titanite Chunk, got it, okay.
[24:50.00]There's another guy in here.
[24:56.18]Wasn't there a third person?
[24:59.18]I swear to god there was three people in here.
[25:03.14]Maybe I'm wrong.
[25:07.69]What's that twinkling sound?
[25:08.63]I hear like a little, I hear a little jingle.
[25:14.16]Thank you, The Coldest Fridge, for your 10 bucks.
[25:16.12]You say, Hey, Jerma, a few streams ago you talked about gorillas, and ever since then, I can't stop listening to them.
[25:21.06]Thanks for introducing me to them.
[25:23.05]Oh.
[25:24.07]I'm glad that somebody did not really listen to them before.
[25:26.75]That listens to them now.
[25:28.79]The gorillas are, like, the best band.
[25:31.43]They're fantastic.
[25:32.35]Every album has been great.
[25:35.45]I've been a fan since I was, like, 14.
[25:37.39]So, 15, whatever.
[25:38.79]Alright, left or right?
[25:40.81]We can go... Let's go left.
[25:43.64]No, let's go right.
[25:45.20]Doesn't look like I can go very far.
[25:48.08]Of course, one of these fucking dickheads is gonna get up.
[25:55.50]Watch out!
[25:57.92]These guys are terrible.
[26:00.51]Wasted coin.
[26:04.07]Feel Good Inc.
[26:04.59]Yeah, Feel Good Inc.
[26:05.19]is a great song.
[26:05.99]Visions of Hidden Path.
[26:11.20]Yeah.
[26:11.92]Where is it?
[26:12.29]Any of you guys ever wish that the rally system... Hold on.
[26:22.83]Hold on a second.
[26:25.07]Hold on.
[26:25.41]Everyone calm down.
[26:27.91]God.
[26:28.99]Oh, God.
[26:31.11]Oh, God.
[26:32.10]Remember the Bloodborne rally system?
[26:35.46]I wish it was in this game.
[26:44.84]I wish I was... I'm trying to hit him, too.
[26:46.23]Kind of in an awkward place.
[26:52.47]How do I get to this item?
[26:56.33]Drop down from up there, I guess?
[27:00.10]Where's this hidden path that you speak of?
[27:01.54]I don't see anything.
[27:03.00]Hidden path.
[27:05.22]Hidden valley ranch.
[27:07.54]Put it on your hot dog.
[27:12.79]Really?
[27:13.19]What the...
[27:15.18]Why do you guys keep spawning?
[27:19.08]Maybe these guys just don't ever stop spawning, okay?
[27:22.75]Whatever.
[27:25.69]Oh, dear.
[27:31.49]Fuck it.
[27:32.14]Don't give me this shit.
[27:35.14]Oh, my God.
[27:37.38]Come on, now.
[27:38.16]It's got a long staff.
[27:45.22]Back it up, boys.
[27:48.38]Back it up.
[27:49.88]Back it up.
[27:51.34]This is too close.
[27:52.06]You're in my personal space.
[27:54.60]You guys are in my personal space.
[27:55.82]Shit.
[27:59.60]Is there nothing else in here?
[28:07.15]I'm... I don't know.
[28:09.23]I don't think there's anything else in here.
[28:13.59]Back it up, boys.
[28:17.38]Okay, well, whatever.
[28:18.46]I guess we're going the other way now.
[28:26.52]Fuck!
[28:35.39]I'll have to go back there later.
[28:39.43]This is probably like a hidden wall over there, but when you're surrounded by like 15 enemies, you kind of can't do it.
[28:44.99]What is going on here?
[28:48.64]Well, that's a new guy.
[28:51.92]Is that a boss?
[28:55.70]I don't think I'm ready for this.
[28:57.68]Am I ready for this?
[28:58.36]No, I'm not.
[29:02.28]Please.
[29:07.78]I need a bonfire.
[29:12.48]Should I just run by?
[29:13.12]I'm gonna run by this.
[29:16.30]One, two, three, go.
[29:19.33]There's gotta be, like, a bonfire right next to this fucking weird snake, like, intestine person.
[29:25.22]Oh.
[29:25.72]Oh!
[29:29.12]Come on.
[29:31.24]Come on!
[29:33.28]No.
[29:35.04]No!
[29:36.32]Oh, shit.
[29:39.46]Oh, shit.
[29:40.84]Oh, and here come the army of the slug people.
[29:43.04]Oh, they come out of the acid.
[29:43.93]They come out of the tar.
[29:45.87]Aww.
[29:48.96]Wait a minute, that's my friend!
[29:51.14]No, they're all dead.
[29:52.92]Take the plunge, right?
[29:53.56]Take the plunge.
[29:54.02]Take the plunge.
[29:54.46]Take the plunge.
[29:55.38]Take the plunge.
[29:55.80]You won't die.
[30:05.47]God damn it, man.
[30:08.03]There it is!
[30:10.49]Yes!
[30:14.15]That's all I wanted.
[30:14.91]Alright, let me go see if I can level up.
[30:21.56]fight them?
[30:22.10]Kim, you don't understand.
[30:23.02]There's a fight or flight response.
[30:27.76]Sometimes it's flight.
[30:30.98]A lot of times in Dark Souls, it's pure flight.
[30:36.32]Sorry, by the way, guys that are getting spoiled.
[30:37.82]There are bonfires in Dark Souls.
[30:42.22]Wait, wasn't this a joke playthrough where I killed everybody?
[30:44.05]Okay, they're back.
[30:44.91]It's fine.
[30:48.75]How much does it take?
[30:49.49]I can do it once.
[30:51.95]My dexterity is okay.
[30:55.67]I really probably should put up my endurance or my vigor, right?
[31:00.91]I'm going to assume that's probably what I need to do.
[31:03.67]Because I already am at... The soft cap was 25.
[31:08.83]Hard cap is 50, I think, right?
[31:12.64]Just go with endurance or vigor.
[31:18.05]Didn't even get the first bonfire.
[31:19.29]Yeah, it did.
[31:24.19]Wait, what happened?
[31:30.30]Fight, flight, or freeze.
[31:32.28]Soft cap is 27.
[31:33.26]So, what did you guys say?
[31:34.10]I should just pump into vigor and endurance at this point?
[31:39.51]All sham, no wow is here.
[31:40.79]All sham, no wow is a good dude.
[31:41.73]Just follow him.
[31:43.76]Mark is a fucking great broadcaster.
[31:45.68]He's a great guy.
[31:47.18]Fucking follow him.
[31:48.32]For crying out loud.
[31:52.95]Also, thank you, Allie.
[31:54.53]For the ten bucks.
[31:56.41]Allie Play.
[31:56.97]Please pet Otto.
[31:58.57]I believe Otto is up with Kim at the moment.
[32:02.01]Good luck.
[32:04.35]I'm just gonna go with endurance.
[32:06.23]Vigor.
[32:10.29]Why do I have 10 vitality?
[32:11.51]What are you talking about?
[32:12.87]Oh.
[32:12.93]I don't know, because I'm a fucking shitty, that's why.
[32:17.85]Where's the first bonfire, then, if I missed it?
[32:30.86]Alright.
[32:32.70]The drag heap.
[32:38.08]Ah!
[32:40.09]Come on.
[32:40.47]Alright, I like this area.
[32:42.25]This area is kind of cool.
[32:44.19]Oh, I wanted to see the new staff that I got.
[32:46.65]What was it called?
[32:48.69]Something long staff.
[32:53.08]Where is it?
[32:53.78]There it is.
[32:54.70]Murky long staff.
[32:57.24]So this is a... I hear something.
[32:59.58]Oh no, don't worry.
[33:00.10]It's just a fucking mushroom bug.
[33:12.74]Sorry is this Dark Souls or is this easier than Mario 1?
[33:17.24]The first level level 1 1 Like I get it FromSoftware sometimes you have an area that's easier than 1-1 in Mario Brothers 1 Come on, where's the challenge?
[33:31.41]Where's the difficulty man?
[33:40.04]I can walk up this.
[33:41.99]I did not know that.
[33:48.21]I guess I can keep going up this.
[33:51.39]Uh, should I backtrack?
[33:52.61]I think I'm gonna backtrack.
[33:56.16]Just a little.
[34:03.30]Can't get up that.
[34:06.21]Come on, where's like the Ahri skip?
[34:07.71]For me to just jump up a wall.
[34:11.89]I'm gonna find it, and everyone on speedruns live is gonna go, holy shit, did you see that guy, what he did?
[34:16.21]He jumped up the wall.
[34:19.29]And then, that's when I make my first million.
[34:24.34]Nope.
[34:26.50]Nope.
[34:31.86]I guess we're going to the hut.
[34:37.62]Might as well.
[34:38.62]I don't have very much to lose, so might as well...
[34:42.78]Okay, I'm going to fall if I do that.
[34:44.00]I'm going to fall if I do that either.
[34:46.06]Are you serious?
[34:54.18]Is there no fall damage in this whole zone?
[35:00.03]I feel like there's no fall damage at all.
[35:02.97]I'm scared to fall off a cliff that's going to be the wrong cliff and is one that can actually hurt you.
[35:06.49]What the hell is that noise?
[35:13.65]Is my frame rate dropping?
[35:14.59]Yes, it is.
[35:15.05]Apparently, this area has frame rate issues until after the first boss, apparently.
[35:20.79]I guess we're just going to have to keep going.
[35:30.68]Run by it.
[35:31.14]Anything over here?
[35:36.30]Apparently not.
[35:37.94]Treasure ahead.
[35:38.60]Really?
[35:38.80]Can I cut this?
[35:46.00]Wait, I can go up this.
[35:47.56]Am I safe here?
[35:49.74]Slightly.
[35:53.64]I'm going to be in this area for a while.
[36:03.19]You think so?
[36:09.67]Hey, Primea.
[36:10.47]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[36:11.25]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[36:12.15]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[36:12.98]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[36:17.17]Thank you for the $10.
[36:19.89]I appreciate that.
[36:21.43]Hopefully you're having a great time.
[36:22.87]And if not, then maybe I can change that.
[36:26.25]Maybe we can have a little bit of a hangout session.
[36:32.66]Like right now.
[36:34.02]Ember.
[36:34.40]Good.
[36:40.54]Interesting.
[36:40.90]Did I really just fall down?
[36:42.86]Hey.
[36:43.74]What?
[36:48.07]This person just follows you around.
[36:52.24]What the fuck are we doing at Mount Hyjal?
[36:56.96]That's a Warcraft reference for those of you guys that know.
[36:59.86]That was a Warcraft joke.
[37:03.03]Somebody right now just heard me say that and was like... Oh, hold on.
[37:09.69]No, no, not in the poison area!
[37:12.27]Another fucking poison area.
[37:15.98]Did somebody tell FromSoftware to stop doing this shit?
[37:22.00]Why do they have to have a poison area?
[37:24.04]Another one.
[37:30.21]You're killing me here.
[37:31.19]Like, what the fuck?
[37:40.35]I need my, like, moss, right?
[37:42.97]That's such a pain in the ass.
[37:47.30]Um, my tool belt.
[37:48.66]I don't have any more of these, so this is the poison.
[37:53.68]Cure's poison.
[37:54.40]Gotta have to put it on, because FromSoftware put another fucking poison swamp in their game.
[38:02.11]Like, you're killing me with this shit.
[38:04.97]You are actually killing me.
[38:15.16]Lord.
[38:17.04]Nope.
[38:18.38]This is gonna be a blast.
[38:20.82]I can already tell.
[38:25.48]Walk up the tree, maybe?
[38:27.13]Yeah.
[38:28.23]Is that guy appearing inside this building?
[38:33.43]I kind of hope he does.
[38:35.37]Get in here.
[38:38.07]Spawn in the building and let me just fucking kill you.
[38:46.32]Here we go.
[38:50.21]I really hope this doesn't get, like, thick.
[38:53.35]The thicker this is, the worse it's gonna be.
[39:01.09]Oh my god!
[39:01.93]I'm dead.
[39:17.01]Fuck this enemy.
[39:18.13]This enemy's fucking stupid, man.
[39:21.89]Why does he need to be here?
[39:25.99]He's just annoying.
[39:28.13]Please tell me I get to fight him and get rid of him.
[39:30.29]Did I even check over here?
[39:42.52]The original hut that I wanted to go into?
[39:48.99]What are you two doing?
[39:51.97]There is an item over here.
[39:53.25]Whatever it is, hopefully it's good.
[39:56.61]Desert pyromancer guard.
[40:03.61]If I was sorcery, would I be able to shoot him with shit and get rid of him?
[40:11.24]I hope so.
[40:34.74]I didn't think that was an edge.
[40:39.26]I didn't think that was an edge.
[40:40.70]I thought that was a continuation of the fucking ground.
[40:44.24]I didn't think that was a fucking edge.
[40:51.29]Well, now I know that's where it drops off.
[40:56.13]Someone's telling me to shoot him with a crossbow?
[40:57.61]Should I bow him?
[40:58.11]Should I shoot him with a bow and arrow?
[41:00.81]Will that do anything?
[41:01.41]I don't think I have any arrows, guys.
[41:05.05]I would be... No, I don't have any... Okay, I got... I got a couple of moonlit.
[41:09.80]I got poison arrows.
[41:11.28]Just shoot this guy with a poison arrow.
[41:19.85]Load it up?
[41:21.01]What are you doing?
[41:22.75]How am I pretending to use the bow right there?
[41:28.37]Hopefully this does something.
[41:32.13]Oh, those are bolts.
[41:33.13]That's funny.
[41:36.16]No, they're not.
[41:36.84]What is going on?
[41:42.94]How come I can't use these?
[41:49.04]What is my character doing?
[41:52.33]What the fuck was that?
[41:53.93]That's not doing anything.
[42:06.28]Am I too far away?
[42:09.10]God.
[42:21.53]Alright, just did 15 damage to him.
[42:24.99]Um... That's not helping.
[42:31.64]Okay, put this fucking thing away.
[42:33.30]I'm just going this way.
[42:41.59]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[42:43.51]Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop.
[42:46.69]And now there's people fucking chasing my ass.
[42:49.91]Oh my god.
[42:52.18]And now I'm back in fucking poison hell.
[42:54.56]And there's fucking two mushrooms.
[42:55.92]I'm gonna die right here.
[42:56.56]No, I'm not.
[42:57.22]Don't say that.
[42:57.68]Just get out the fucking tree.
[42:59.90]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[43:01.69]Drink.
[43:01.81]I'm not stopping.
[43:02.27]Oh my god.
[43:05.03]Holy fuck.
[43:08.93]Holy fuck.
[43:10.21]This enemy is unbearable.
[43:14.54]Why Dark Souls even bother with a bow?
[43:16.35]I really don't know why Dark Souls even, like, you can exist with a bow.
[43:26.91]I mean, it's a little... It looks good!
[43:33.60]Well, I'm sorry you died.
[43:35.26]Again.
[43:35.88]Well, I'm gonna die like 10,000 more times.
[43:38.98]No, it's not that drastic.
[43:41.27]No, it will be.
[43:45.35]Yeah, this is intense and this is this fucking angel is gonna cause me so much pain So much suffering I'll try I'll try to die as long as I can Nah, she ain't here, she's probably in the other room Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, go Yeah, that was Kim
[44:10.68]There's an item right here.
[44:17.23]Kim is the angel.
[44:18.27]I actually like this way better.
[44:22.63]You can skip all these fucking assholes.
[44:30.50]Die slowly.
[44:31.34]I know.
[44:34.44]That's petrifying me.
[44:35.58]That's what that's doing.
[44:36.62]Okay, I get it.
[44:40.82]I really seriously need a game plan here, because I don't know if I want to do what I just did.
[44:44.76]Let me sit here and look at this for a second.
[44:46.26]So that... She needs to... This, like, angel needs to go the fuck away.
[44:50.95]Oh, I need to just dodge through it.
[44:57.65]I'm going to try doing a dodge one more time.
[45:00.23]I'm going to keep running, and I'm going to dodge at the right moments.
[45:05.33]She does a big one like that.
[45:08.25]She'll get scratched by it.
[45:10.83]Oh my god.
[45:15.24]Holy shit, this is fucking horrible.
[45:20.62]This is fucking horrible.
[45:28.94]Have you accepted our lord and savior?
[45:30.54]Not yet.
[45:33.28]Not using the sorcery build.
[45:34.72]My sorcery build is good.
[45:36.89]Actually, I probably should do that.
[45:42.03]I'm just gonna run through this wall.
[45:43.31]There's probably a good item up there, but I... It's just... It's just too much for me.
[45:53.92]I'm just going.
[45:59.11]Let's go.
[46:01.45]What does this say?
[46:02.67]Jumping ahead.
[46:02.99]Oh shit.
[46:04.31]I just lost so much health for no reason.
[46:11.02]I almost just insta-dived on that guy too.
[46:14.31]At this point, I'm hovering like the wall over here.
[46:27.58]Look at my little bunker over here.
[47:01.78]This is fucking insane.
[47:09.82]And okay, so here's what happened.
[47:12.36]This is like the last Dark Souls content that's ever gonna happen.
[47:17.27]Like Dark Souls 3 is over.
[47:18.87]The Dark Souls series is done.
[47:21.13]So they were just like, you know what?
[47:23.15]Just throw up a bunch of fucking awful shit in this zone.
[47:27.27]Make it the worst fucking possible thing you could ever imagine.
[47:30.87]And just, yeah, that's it.
[47:33.03]We're done after this shit.
[47:37.22]Hey, are we like, we're done, right?
[47:39.54]Yeah, we're done.
[47:41.48]I got an idea.
[47:42.88]We're like actually done done with the whole series, right?
[47:45.94]Yeah, well, why do you keep saying that?
[47:47.10]Well, because people are gonna fucking hate us with my idea.
[47:49.98]There's this angel that shoots these fucking laser beams and you can't ever dodge.
[47:53.84]You can't get rid of it.
[47:55.50]And it's a poison swamp, too.
[47:56.66]Jason loves that.
[48:04.20]Come on, do the dumb thing.
[48:05.94]This thing.
[48:09.40]Go from tree to tree.
[48:16.26]Fuck.
[48:20.40]There you go, there you go, there, there, there, there, there.
[48:22.69]Fuck.
[48:23.31]Wrong button.
[48:26.55]I don't even care if I'm poisoned.
[48:29.97]Just keep me safe and let me get up here.
[48:33.07]This guy just popped himself off.
[48:40.07]Wait for the stupid curse.
[48:46.84]Come on.
[48:47.86]Do it.
[48:51.94]I don't care about the items.
[48:53.66]I don't.
[48:55.24]Get me inside the building, please.
[48:58.36]Oh, man.
[48:58.96]Where am I?
[49:02.06]I can top myself off.
[49:02.81]I'm not... Fuck that.
[49:03.49]I don't even know if I'm going the right direction.
[49:07.97]Thank God it's a stopping point.
[49:09.81]What does this say?
[49:10.95]Miscreant ahead.
[49:11.81]Okay.
[49:13.43]Whatever you say.
[49:17.37]I've never seen these guys before with glowing swords like that.
[49:24.09]I need the items.
[49:24.83]I'm gonna have to go back, man.
[49:28.91]What is this?
[49:29.59]Who is that?
[49:31.15]Oh, no.
[49:32.37]This is like a hunter.
[49:33.03]This is like a mini-boss.
[49:34.43]Oh, great.
[49:34.89]And you got two dickheads with you with fire pokers?
[49:36.61]I just dodged into that and I'm fucking dead.
[49:41.50]Now I gotta go back out to the fucking angel lady.
[49:50.03]Get out of the fucking way.
[49:51.39]Oh my god.
[49:52.23]I hate this game.
[49:53.31]I hate it.
[49:53.59]I've never played it again.
[49:57.51]I'm never playing this game again.
[50:02.78]Never again.
[50:03.96]I'm never gonna play this game again.
[50:05.10]I'll put it in the closet after this.
[50:12.14]I'm gonna go in the backyard and I'm gonna bury this game.
[50:20.91]I'm going to dig a hole 30 feet deep.
[50:24.81]And it's going in that hole.
[50:35.19]Alright.
[50:35.83]Wow.
[50:35.93]Easy.
[50:36.25]Easy, lady.
[50:43.05]I'm just going to whip.
[50:47.50]Oh!
[50:50.53]Oh, that hurts.
[50:51.17]That hurts big time.
[50:53.30]Oh, that hurts.
[50:54.68]I'll tell you.
[50:55.26]Oh, that got me, Odell.
[50:57.02]The tip there just got me, Odell.
[51:00.12]Folks, right now, we may need to see some emergency surgery in the studio.
[51:09.67]You bitch.
[51:11.17]You didn't just do that shit, did you?
[51:16.56]Got you.
[51:21.29]I died in fucking two hits.
[51:23.29]I died in two swings.
[51:31.83]Instantly dead.
[51:44.15]God damn it.
[52:07.97]Putting on the anti-fire clothes now.
[52:11.63]Considering embering.
[52:12.45]You know, that's probably a good idea.
[52:13.99]But I'm not going to do that right now because I might die from the annoying enemy.
[52:22.08]Ay-yi-yi.
[52:22.78]They were not fucking around when they made this.
[52:25.54]They all got shit-faced.
[52:27.04]All of them got drunk.
[52:31.07]They just got so drunk at this.
[52:36.66]Like, who's the leader of FromSoftware?
[52:39.82]It got to the point where this was so ridiculous that he... They were all shit-faced.
[52:44.04]The computer just needed to press enter.
[52:50.52]He needed to press enter.
[52:54.13]And he was like, I just need to press enter and it'll be, like, pushed through into Sony.
[53:00.81]And he, like, throws up on the fucking computer and pressed enter.
[53:08.02]He did a disgusting fucking, like, vodka alcohol puke on the keyboard.
[53:12.18]And pressed enter.
[53:12.68]And then they all woke up the next day.
[53:16.47]Like, just, they were blackout drunk, all woke up the next day, like, what happened?
[53:24.21]Did we make a DLC last night?
[53:26.01]I don't think we did, did we?
[53:36.41]I don't know, did we make a DLC last night?
[53:38.30]Is it like fucking impossible?
[53:40.12]I think we did.
[53:40.72]I forget.
[53:47.67]Alright, here we go.
[53:52.95]Why did I go that way?
[53:53.71]Because I'm just like complaining about the game.
[53:55.45]I need to play.
[54:11.38]Let's just chill for a second.
[54:13.10]I'm gonna take an Ember over here.
[54:14.32]Let me do this slow.
[54:19.69]These guys don't make it any easier, either.
[54:22.61]Thank god they can die from this shit, though.
[54:25.15]That would be so horrible if they couldn't.
[54:31.72]Eh.
[54:40.51]This is the hardest part of the DLC?
[54:41.77]This first area?
[54:43.03]Really?
[54:51.17]Am I doing something wrong?
[54:55.58]Maybe if I just sit here.
[54:57.96]She'll get sick of me and she'll come down and fight me.
[55:03.62]Maybe.
[55:07.36]I have an idea.
[55:07.92]We're going to go for it.
[55:10.65]What happens if I fucking shoot her in the wings?
[55:15.93]She'll just turn... Yeah, I'm not trying to paint you.
[55:25.11]Well, I... I don't know.
[55:33.73]Is there anywhere else I can, like, shoot you?
[55:39.05]Besides, like, the random obvious places.
[55:40.55]10 hole damage.
[55:47.04]Yeah, I find that such bullshit.
[55:49.24]Right in the face.
[55:51.30]Oh my god, somebody just gave a hundred bucks.
[55:58.77]I don't think that's correct.
[56:00.69]Hold on.
[56:01.97]Hold on.
[56:02.31]Somebody gave a fucking hundred dollars.
[56:11.50]Maybe I have to drop down and hit her.
[56:17.82]Alright.
[56:19.06]Anyways, let me just take one second here.
[56:22.31]And say a very special thank you to Sir Jimmy.
[56:29.44]Sir Jimmy.
[56:31.28]Uh, Sir Jim... Sir Jimmy Jammer.
[56:33.98]Says, Hi, Jerm Boy.
[56:34.78]I'm leaving for the Air Force soon, so I'll leave you with this parting gift.
[56:37.96]I will be back.
[56:39.30]Well, Sir Jimmy, I wish you the best of luck.
[56:42.88]Hopefully you do well in the Air Force.
[56:48.59]I'm sure everyone here will wish you the best of luck.
[56:51.85]And thank you for that hundred bucks.
[56:53.69]It's very kind of you.
[56:56.37]Some of that Air Force money.
[57:02.28]Yeah, hopefully you do well.
[57:06.58]I'm waiting for him to do that thing.
[57:13.86]No, he's not doing it.
[57:19.74]Come on.
[57:20.00]No, that's not what I wanted to see.
[57:23.54]Oh my god.
[57:29.36]Alright, give me the fucking... How do I do it?
[57:30.82]I don't even care.
[57:33.19]How do I kill this thing?
[57:35.63]I'll be doing this for the next four hours.
[57:37.51]How do I beat this?
[57:38.09]I don't give a shit about spoilers anymore.
[57:40.31]How do you kill this stupid fucking angel?
[57:42.53]Like, what's the easiest way to do this?
[57:44.21]I'm fucking sick of seeing this.
[57:49.71]I don't fucking even care anymore.
[57:51.33]I wanna just play Dark Souls.
[58:00.98]Are you shitting me?
[58:04.01]You gotta be kidding me.
[58:05.39]That's what this shit is?
[58:09.27]This stupid slimy muscle person was the thing controlling this?
[58:16.87]Oh.
[58:17.49]God.
[58:19.16]Let's go kill that stupid thing.
[58:20.60]Are you serious?
[58:25.52]What the fuck?
[58:28.48]The slimy, like, exoskeleton muscle thing.
[58:34.65]Where is it, though?
[58:38.03]There's one for each angel.
[58:39.63]Oh, great.
[58:43.24]Where the hell is his secret little fucking muscle puke body?
[58:49.90]Well, alright.
[58:55.54]Let's go find his body.
[59:01.62]I'm assuming that's going to be somewhere in this area, right?
[59:05.80]Yeah.
[59:08.90]He wasn't over here.
[59:09.42]He definitely was not over there.
[59:11.97]So he has to be like down here.
[59:13.57]Not like this way.
[59:18.73]Okay.
[59:28.78]Seriously.
[59:30.28]Seriously, like I'm just gonna- This is so fucking stupid.
[59:39.49]Fuck me.
[59:40.13]I just want to find this stupid body.
[59:42.17]You can't find the body because the thing just rains hell on you the whole fucking time.
[59:46.19]It just rains fucking hell on you and you can't stop.
[59:57.15]Fuck this.
[60:03.06]Can't it have like a couple seconds in between?
[60:06.06]Like five seconds or something?
[60:08.94]What in the name of God?
[60:10.29]I'm going over here.
[60:22.19]Gotta use my stealthy skills.
[60:27.93]I don't wanna see you.
[60:31.45]Where is he?
[60:31.87]Where is he?
[60:36.65]Where is he?
[60:37.63]Ah, God.
[60:39.07]Back that way?
[60:39.87]I don't know.
[60:51.39]I just want one second FromSoftware, please.
[60:59.81]Where is this fucking nice dumbass body?
[61:08.90]No, dude.
[61:12.90]What the fuck?
[61:20.47]Yeah, like I told you before, this is the final DLC that they're ever going to make for a Dark Souls game.
[61:25.23]So of course they're going to make it a fucking shitshow.
[61:28.61]Of course they are.
[61:32.41]I just want to see if I can see the damn thing.
[61:42.54]It's not over there.
[61:45.61]I guess I just... I'm gonna try.
[61:46.75]I'm just gonna do what I was doing before and just hide.
[61:50.63]Just see if we can get up there again.
[61:52.63]Get a better view.
[61:53.15]They're not even looking at me right now.
[62:00.54]He's not doing anything.
[62:11.11]Oh shit, he's doing that stupid thing.
[62:12.61]I'm in trouble.
[62:13.35]Now I'm in trouble.
[62:15.07]Now I'm in big trouble.
[62:16.67]Why did I come up here again?
[62:20.27]Anybody have a fucking answer to why I just did this?
[62:23.42]Okay, I got the plus three over three ring of favor.
[62:25.54]Good.
[62:41.80]Holy dog shit.
[62:44.26]Where is it?
[62:46.61]Increases HP, stamina, and maximum equipment load.
[62:48.91]Oh boy.
[62:50.43]That was actually worth getting.
[62:58.99]Oh god.
[63:06.72]I wonder what I should put on instead.
[63:08.82]Should I take off the life ring?
[63:13.10]I think that's what I should have on.
[63:14.12]Alright, I'm going to do this.
[63:19.03]I'm going to go back, because I did just fall down this whole thing.
[63:26.95]Can I get back up there that way, or do I have to actually go all the way back to the beginning?
[63:32.31]Keep the life ring on.
[63:35.29]I think I have to go all the way back.
[63:44.65]Because I did just run past all this shit.
[63:47.25]Should I go back?
[63:48.61]You think that's a good idea?
[63:50.81]I don't fucking know.
[63:52.54]At this point, I'm so lost in what to do here.
[63:57.22]That's not even the angel that's fucking with me.
[63:58.84]Yeah, I know.
[64:00.70]Is there any other way that I didn't go?
[64:01.98]Or do I have to go down on that spot?
[64:11.63]Well, I guess I'm just going to have to wrap around.
[64:27.72]I should be embering.
[64:28.40]Well, the reason why I'm not embering is because I have no idea what I'm doing right now.
[64:32.95]And I would like... I don't... Because I'm going to waste embers that way.
[64:36.33]I'm going to die.
[64:43.94]I can seriously tell you that I hate this place.
[64:49.08]This feels too, like, too, like it's just too much going on.
[64:53.80]Give me the difficulty, not the random fucking guy that rains hell the whole time you're here till you find his fucking, like, bug body.
[64:59.12]Alright, what, is there anything else here?
[65:07.61]No.
[65:13.91]There's a squad over there.
[65:14.89]Let me just not die.
[65:20.91]This is Lee's.
[65:22.70]My god!
[65:24.91]Please!
[65:41.00]I've played every single DLC.
[65:43.85]I've played every Dark Souls.
[65:46.29]I've played Bloodborne and all of Bloodborne's DLC.
[65:48.89]This might be the worst fucking DLC I've ever played.
[65:51.87]Not necessarily, and I'm not saying it's bad.
[65:54.27]I'm saying in regards to how annoying and difficult this actually is for me.
[65:58.00]This is by far the worst of any DLC.
[66:02.04]Without a doubt in my fucking tiny mind.
[66:11.15]Where am I going next?
[66:12.11]I'm gonna hop right there.
[66:13.03]I'm gonna die.
[66:16.33]I say that every time.
[66:17.03]I said that last time, too.
[66:18.35]They're not fucking wrong.
[66:19.01]This is the last game that they're ever gonna make in this series.
[66:21.05]Alright, I need to just, like, look and see where the fuck I'm going.
[66:26.17]This is just too much for my brain.
[66:30.49]Gets way better after this.
[66:31.49]This part is really fucking annoying if you don't know what to do.
[66:35.38]Oh, I can fucking see that, man.
[66:37.48]This sucks.
[66:41.80]This sucks like asshole.
[66:44.34]This is like the not fun kind of stuff.
[66:50.95]Okay.
[66:52.77]I haven't gone over there.
[66:53.57]I don't think I can even go over there.
[67:00.55]What if we're there?
[67:01.17]Maybe just hide in this corner.
[67:06.27]That's not the thing I'm looking for.
[67:09.31]At all.
[67:11.30]I was hoping it was going to be like that fucking dumb guy.
[67:14.24]What are you all doing back here?
[67:16.56]Is there nothing over here?
[67:21.80]Oh god, there's two of these fucking guys.
[67:24.56]What the fuck?
[67:27.49]Give me your shit.
[67:28.17]That's a Titanite slab.
[67:29.41]That guy didn't even do anything.
[67:30.63]Alright, you just take that shit.
[67:31.73]Hey!
[67:33.47]I was supposed to be guarding that.
[67:37.31]How dare you?
[67:45.27]Well, I got it.
[67:56.51]And now I have this guy chasing my ass.
[68:01.09]Where's the angel?
[68:02.65]Where's the angel?
[68:12.95]Well, at least I made it back to here.
[68:15.93]Should I keep going down here?
[68:17.35]Ooh, wait a minute.
[68:20.97]Wait just a second.
[68:22.75]Wait just a second.
[68:24.29]Uh-oh.
[68:24.49]Okay, hold on.
[68:25.05]Calm down.
[68:27.07]I haven't been here.
[68:28.01]I gotta fucking fight this guy, right?
[68:31.38]As much as this is not gonna be fun.
[68:40.30]I'm surprised that actually hit me.
[68:57.34]Take a lot of hits.
[68:58.36]Come on, do the jump again.
[69:04.83]Come on.
[69:09.21]Come on.
[69:31.82]Really?
[69:32.52]Fucking you baseball swinging shithead.
[69:34.82]You're too slow.
[69:39.99]Fuck me.
[69:45.45]Why was I staggered for so fucking long?
[69:58.84]alive.
[69:59.52]Would you fucking seriously stuff a sock up your ass?
[70:01.64]He's still alive.
[70:02.34]I've got 10 levels underneath.
[70:07.66]Am I like 30 fucking levels underneath for this area?
[70:11.92]Like, holy god.
[70:17.81]Ooh.
[70:17.99]I don't have any poise.
[70:27.87]There he is.
[70:29.69]There's that motherfucker.
[70:30.73]He's right there, right?
[70:34.15]Where's that fucking soup person?
[70:36.85]No, that's not him.
[70:40.10]Where is this fucking soup person?
[70:45.56]Come on!
[70:47.98]You trying to tell me that that dumbass soup person is not over here?
[70:57.50]120 plus are you gonna have a bad time?
[70:59.22]Are you serious?
[71:01.50]This guy's like 90.
[71:07.83]Well, here's that.
[71:10.83]I can go this way.
[71:11.79]That's where the fire lady is.
[71:13.95]God, I'm so fucked.
[71:18.05]I'm seriously in so much trouble right now.
[71:19.64]Well, at least I did that and I got that item.
[71:21.68]Whatever the fuck cares.
[71:27.89]Is there anything here?
[71:30.37]No.
[71:30.43]I'm just gonna go back up to the fire person, I think.
[71:32.89]His back is just turned.
[71:45.72]If I'm really quiet, will he turn around?
[71:51.07]He's not even paying attention.
[71:52.53]Shh!
[71:53.83]Just gotta pick this up and then run.
[72:11.55]Okay.
[72:11.81]There's a spot to go over here.
[72:16.83]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[72:20.81]Oh my god, what a mess.
[72:36.56]Can I go up here?
[72:39.80]There's like nothing there.
[72:42.81]I need to be able to see, though.
[72:51.36]I guess I go this way?
[72:53.90]I guess?
[72:56.51]Try left.
[72:57.05]Alright, I'll try left.
[73:04.07]What does that do for me?
[73:05.09]I don't... Why did it want me to do that?
[73:08.48]No.
[73:09.46]Go back up.
[73:20.60]I'm so scared right now.
[73:32.42]There it is.
[73:32.72]There he is, there he is.
[73:35.10]Are these guys easy?
[73:36.79]Is this gonna be like a wuss?
[73:38.79]Please tell me he's like a wuss.
[73:40.87]Just let me shove my weapon up his ass.
[73:42.37]Oh thank god, he's so easy.
[73:48.92]Thank God.
[73:51.06]Ugh.
[73:55.60]Now I know what that is.
[73:57.14]Jesus.
[73:59.10]Now I don't have any Estus flasks.
[74:01.77]I have no anything.
[74:03.25]Okay.
[74:03.55]Well, now I know.
[74:04.09]I'm just going to run to there every time.
[74:06.25]Good.
[74:08.07]Great.
[74:08.51]Wonderful.
[74:09.01]Ran.
[74:10.35]No fucking yelling on the bus.
[74:13.87]Time for revenge.
[74:16.31]What does that mean exactly?
[74:19.17]Whatever.
[74:21.35]Okay.
[74:22.87]Let's continue exploring the zone.
[74:24.57]What do you say?
[74:25.43]I'm going to go that way, but I'm not going to go that way yet.
[74:30.59]I want to see what else is over here.
[74:34.64]I will have my revenge.
[74:36.22]And...
[74:45.66]Here comes this guy.
[74:47.54]I don't have people to be chasing me right now.
[74:50.14]This guy that was all the way back in the cave is all the way over here now.
[74:54.43]Get out of here.
[74:54.99]There's like two items that I want to get before I keep going.
[75:02.31]Don't turn around, please.
[75:03.37]Tighten that chunk.
[75:07.32]Am I going into any of these buildings?
[75:10.08]I don't think so.
[75:17.58]This used to be an anxiety stream.
[75:21.22]Oh, by the way, thank you for telling me that.
[75:23.64]I'm so glad I asked what to do there because I never would have figured that out because I've ran by the first one in fear.
[75:29.42]So, thank you.
[75:31.88]So now where the hell am I going?
[75:38.69]Back up and around?
[75:40.55]Where I was going before to where the fire lady was, I guess?
[75:44.83]I don't have any fucking Estus Blasts to fight this lady.
[75:54.65]It's like, seriously, I'm going to die here.
[75:55.98]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[76:04.92]Wasn't it all the way back here?
[76:06.88]To go all the way up again?
[76:07.86]Or could I wrap around from that way?
[76:09.24]I don't even know.
[76:11.77]I might just run by the lady and see if there's a shortcut or something.
[76:14.21]Because I definitely won't be able to kill her with this.
[76:18.38]Good luck.
[76:24.10]Well, here's what I'm going to have to do.
[76:25.39]We're going to have to put an ember on here.
[76:31.07]I have a divine blessing, too.
[76:38.11]We'll try Ember and Divine Blessing if I can't do it until then.
[76:40.67]And this is not even the right way.
[76:42.23]Not even the fucking right way.
[76:43.59]I'm going the wrong way.
[76:45.75]I have to go that way.
[76:47.67]Ugh, I'm so confused.
[76:49.03]I'm just confusing myself at this point.
[77:00.51]I'm just confusing myself.
[77:05.79]RIP Divine Blessing.
[77:09.92]Yeah.
[77:11.46]Should we tell him?
[77:12.06]What do you mean, should we tell him?
[77:13.18]Should we tell him what?
[77:15.98]What do you mean, should we tell him?
[77:21.62]Should we tell him?
[77:25.98]I'm gonna run by and get, like, the bonfire.
[77:27.58]Or open up the fucking elevator.
[77:28.80]That's what's back there.
[77:29.38]There's an elevator back there.
[77:31.40]There has to be.
[77:37.64]Son of a gun.
[77:40.27]Alright, here's the plan.
[77:41.67]Get them to come down here, run by, and open up the secret elevator.
[77:46.60]I can't fight this.
[77:49.34]If I take two swings, I'm gonna die.
[77:51.34]So here we go.
[77:52.62]Here's the plan.
[77:54.24]Bang.
[77:54.76]She comes over.
[77:55.60]Throws one pyro.
[77:56.54]Dodge.
[77:57.48]Zip through.
[77:58.00]Watch out for the fire pokers.
[77:59.31]Dip to the right.
[78:00.13]Dodge.
[78:01.39]Secret elevator.
[78:02.17]You got it.
[78:02.79]Three, two, one, action!
[78:13.06]I died.
[78:14.54]I died.
[78:14.82]I fucking hate this place.
[78:25.83]I hate this place.
[78:27.31]I hate this place.
[78:28.77]I fucking hate this place.
[78:31.70]I'm not even gonna fight this.
[78:32.94]No, I'm just gonna run to the lady.
[78:36.51]I'm gonna run to the fucking lady.
[78:39.61]I ain't even doing this anymore.
[78:41.69]I'm just fucking running right to this person.
[78:43.91]We're not spending any time.
[78:45.21]I'm gonna just hide behind the tree trunks.
[78:48.51]And we're gonna go.
[78:50.49]Seriously.
[78:51.69]This is out of fucking control.
[78:54.47]We're just going right for this branch.
[78:56.41]And I'm running up the branch.
[78:58.81]Why would I stop?
[78:59.53]We're gonna top ourselves off to 200,000% HP.
[79:04.29]And I'm going up there.
[79:05.49]And I'm not going to get hit.
[79:06.13]Because I'm going to hide right here.
[79:08.65]No, I'm going to hide back here.
[79:10.44]Go ahead, shoot the bullets at me.
[79:12.14]Do it.
[79:13.48]You won't even do it.
[79:14.88]Fine.
[79:16.88]That's it.
[79:17.88]I'm good.
[79:24.22]We're good.
[79:26.64]Wait a minute.
[79:27.88]Is that angel permanently dead?
[79:31.33]Oh.
[79:32.71]Alright, we're going to ember here.
[79:36.92]Ember, we're not fucking this up.
[79:38.36]I'm gonna beat this fucking group of... This Wizard of Oz group.
[79:42.07]Here we go.
[79:43.57]No stopping.
[79:46.11]Take a fucking page out of Burgah Boy's book.
[79:48.35]You just go.
[79:49.97]You just go and you fucking just start swinging.
[79:53.27]All you guys wanna watch, like, the fucking Dark Souls streamers that, like, oh, wow, I gotta, like, be tactical.
[79:57.18]No, just take the fucking Burgah Boy technique and just start swinging.
[80:02.26]See, it worked.
[80:09.67]See?
[80:11.99]See?
[80:13.95]Burgah Boy technique.
[80:15.13]Works every fucking time.
[80:16.19]You don't think we're going to do it again?
[80:20.29]See?
[80:23.20]What?
[80:27.52]What the fuck?
[80:28.76]Wait, why are you still alive?
[80:32.72]Oh, can I drop down and kill her?
[80:35.10]Okay, here we go.
[80:36.40]I'm going to get this.
[80:37.32]This is going to be a big kill here.
[80:42.20]DIE!
[80:43.78]Oh, I just smashed her!
[80:45.38]For 56 damage.
[80:48.50]For 56 damage!
[81:03.84]Oh my god!
[81:05.28]Did you see that?
[81:08.57]She took so much damage, how unfair.
[81:15.51]Burgah Boy technique.
[81:18.29]She heals.
[81:18.69]Yeah, that's great.
[81:20.01]I gotta get you caught up in the Burgah Boy technique.
[81:26.21]The secret Burgah Boy technique.
[81:27.49]Is she being poisoned, by the way?
[81:30.84]Secret Burgah Boy technique.
[81:41.64]Don't heal again.
[81:45.66]Poor shit, by the way.
[81:49.34]I just got invaded by somebody.
[81:50.64]Are you seriously gonna invade me right now, and you spawn right there?
[81:56.58]Oh, hallelujah!
[81:57.81]What a fucking great video game!
[81:59.63]Welcome to Dark Souls, ladies and gentlemen, where the guy with the fucking purple twitch.tv Grimace weapon is gonna come kill me!
[82:05.73]Isn't that just fucking wonderful?
[82:07.53]Can't wait to play the DLC of Dark Souls 3 on stream!
[82:10.79]Watch out for the Grimace McDonald's weapon!
[82:15.81]I just, like, worked myself up for no reason.
[82:17.46]He didn't even do anything.
[82:21.54]Fuck this.
[82:27.15]Fuck this.
[82:42.57]Leave me alone.
[82:43.19]I don't want to do this.
[82:44.31]I just want to open up the elevator.
[82:46.33]I just want to open up the elevator.
[82:48.45]Let me eat my Grimace.
[82:49.75]Let me eat my McDonald's Grimace nugget.
[82:51.72]Okay, good.
[82:54.00]Drink the divine blessing.
[82:56.44]He's getting closer.
[82:57.48]He's getting closer.
[82:58.20]Where's the elevator?
[83:00.44]Where's the secret elevator?
[83:02.46]Where's the elevator?
[83:03.98]What does this say?
[83:04.93]Here.
[83:06.35]It says here.
[83:06.93]That means it's here, right?
[83:07.83]What's here?
[83:09.21]Oh!
[83:18.11]No!
[83:26.25]Fuck.
[83:28.10]I'm drinking the divine blessing.
[83:29.76]No, I'm not.
[83:30.20]That's a mistake.
[83:32.08]Hey, can you kill shit for me?
[83:33.18]Go kill that thing.
[83:35.76]What is he pointing at?
[83:46.96]Kick him off.
[83:49.71]I don't understand.
[83:50.39]Where am I supposed to go?
[83:54.81]He's pointing.
[83:55.39]What is he pointing at?
[83:58.59]Alright, looks like this guy's going to actually help me here.
[84:00.95]You fucking just tried to kill me.
[84:02.67]I mean, down there?
[84:06.14]How don't you think about doing that shit?
[84:13.46]Here we go.
[84:16.93]No fall damage.
[84:17.99]We're good.
[84:20.07]Oh, and there's the lady.
[84:25.64]They're just circling down.
[84:27.76]Thank God there's no fall damage, so idiots like me can play.
[84:32.74]I'm so happy there's no fall damage.
[84:38.43]Alright, hold on.
[84:39.09]We had some donations here.
[84:40.19]Let me just say hello to some people.
[84:44.33]Alright, first of all...
[84:46.44]Thank you, Irish guy, for the five bucks.
[84:49.36]Let me touch your bum.
[84:50.02]Thank you for 15 bucks.
[84:52.40]You guys say game sucks.
[84:53.45]And then, hey, Jerm, I've been watching you for years.
[84:54.91]Just wanted to say thanks for the awesome.
[84:57.01]Can I touch your bum?
[84:58.13]Well, no.
[84:58.91]You cannot touch my bum.
[85:00.47]That's not what's going to happen.
[85:02.76]And hold on.
[85:05.15]We're okay.
[85:06.71]Everybody can calm down for a second.
[85:09.83]Gummy Monk gave five bucks.
[85:12.30]I say, love to hang out.
[85:13.32]My spoilers.
[85:14.92]Thank you for the five dollars.
[85:16.24]Good Burger also gave five dollars, and they say hi.
[85:20.72]How are you guys?
[85:21.56]Good?
[85:27.00]On a scale of one to ten, how enraged am I?
[85:28.67]Not really at all, actually.
[85:31.21]If that took any longer, I would have been very upset, but it's fine.
[85:34.39]It's just barely enough frustration.
[85:39.44]What are you pointing at?
[85:43.08]No fall damage, I'm fine.
[85:51.45]You dick.
[85:53.51]You fucking dick.
[85:57.45]So uncalled for.
[85:59.85]So uncalled for.
[86:01.57]Okay.
[86:02.29]Well, let's do it again.
[86:05.27]That guy took so long to do that.
[86:09.42]I feel fucking betrayed.
[86:17.87]class act and that was an ember down too but whatever this guy's gone actually what's over there I can go up there if you only summoned me he wouldn't have been there this is true but we're okay I could try to kill that lady again
[86:43.91]I'm actually glad how, like, long this is taking me.
[86:47.17]It's very, very difficult and very time-consuming.
[86:49.39]And I'm gonna get poisoned, but I don't care.
[86:54.31]I'm just gonna eat a fucking dirty moss clump.
[87:01.18]Get done with this shit.
[87:02.92]I need to try to kill this person.
[87:06.74]Can you parry a whip?
[87:13.34]Are whips parryable?
[87:16.46]But I feel like I'd be too scared to try to parry.
[87:18.06]In the current state of affairs, really.
[87:24.89]Let's try this again.
[87:25.69]Now come on, what's this dodging?
[87:38.41]What's this dodging?
[87:44.35]Alright, one-on-one, let's go.
[87:45.43]Me versus you.
[87:45.95]Let's do it.
[87:49.95]I did so much damage with, like, full fire resist on, too.
[87:53.07]I want to, like, backstab you, but I can't really get behind you.
[88:03.79]Even with full fucking fire resist, you see that shit?
[88:08.06]Why do you do so much damage?
[88:18.10]back this is fucking crazy like your stamina meter is fucking ridiculous get out of here again I don't even care you're gonna drink no you're not no you are not going to drink you are not going to drink on my watch and I will take your useless item for my character thank you
[88:51.71]Okay.
[88:53.42]Let's try this again.
[88:58.56]Let's take it slow.
[89:01.30]Burgah Boy wins.
[89:02.02]Burgah Boy always wins.
[89:04.05]What does it say here for here?
[89:08.49]I just didn't even fucking want to do that.
[89:22.17]Nice work.
[89:24.47]I know.
[89:24.87]I just want to be out of this area.
[89:27.83]I hate this place.
[89:31.75]I hate this place.
[89:32.57]I like this place.
[89:33.31]I hate this place.
[89:39.67]I love this place.
[89:40.93]I hate this place.
[89:45.87]So, I need to kill one of those stupid things.
[89:48.95]Good luck finding where that one is.
[89:52.23]Because I have no idea.
[89:58.83]Can I go back up this?
[90:00.45]No.
[90:02.97]I mean, what's down there?
[90:06.89]The guy that invaded me was like telling me to look over that way.
[90:11.73]But why?
[90:12.25]I don't see anything.
[90:23.69]There?
[90:24.61]I don't know.
[90:35.07]Blinkwing Titanite.
[90:39.33]Um... I don't know.
[90:42.06]I don't know.
[90:49.68]I don't know, but this is taking me all the way over here.
[90:51.43]I'm going to stay right here.
[90:52.05]This is safe right here.
[90:55.69]How do I get down from there?
[91:00.13]On top of the building?
[91:05.25]I know I have to get that way, but can I... Don't fall, don't fall, don't fall, don't fall.
[91:10.93]I know.
[91:11.59]I'm going that over and over again in my head.
[91:15.36]Here comes the next one, right?
[91:16.18]Do the next one.
[91:19.48]And bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[91:22.08]And here comes the big one.
[91:24.16]And go.
[91:25.04]Nope, go.
[91:29.12]Nope, that wasn't right.
[91:38.33]This is super annoying.
[91:48.10]This is just annoying.
[91:49.28]Okay, there's hard and then there's annoying.
[91:54.68]This is annoying.
[91:56.80]This is annoying.
[91:58.06]This is annoying.
[91:59.18]This shit's fucking annoying.
[92:01.76]See, that's annoying.
[92:03.65]Hey, guess what's annoying?
[92:04.77]That's annoying.
[92:15.07]Anybody else getting annoyed?
[92:19.40]I am.
[92:20.04]My hand's in the air.
[92:20.74]I am.
[92:22.74]I'm annoyed.
[92:27.21]Actually, that was your fault.
[92:28.37]No, it wasn't.
[92:28.75]That was annoying.
[92:29.37]That was my fault?
[92:33.85]No, that was annoying.
[92:34.81]That wasn't my fault.
[92:35.45]That was annoying.
[92:39.44]I'm just gonna have to run, I guess.
[92:40.96]I don't know.
[92:46.12]I'm going to have to top myself off and hopefully I can just do what I was going to do and just try to run.
[92:49.54]I end up safe here.
[92:58.59]Look, there's a spot I can jump down over there.
[93:02.49]Because this goes that way and there's nothing else.
[93:06.92]It's just to get to there.
[93:08.56]So if I run, run, run, run, run, run and sprint on top of this building and jump on top of this building.
[93:15.33]That's where it wants me to be.
[93:16.03]We're just going to have to go for it.
[93:18.99]I need to get on top of that building.
[93:21.41]We're going to actually try to go for it right now.
[93:25.95]Oh, fuck.
[93:27.09]I... I hate that I have to do this.
[93:33.65]I hate that I have to do this shit.
[93:40.53]Ugh.
[93:45.00]Can I just fucking fight enemies that are difficult and progress through the game?
[93:50.40]Why do I have to do this?
[93:51.48]I just want to jump to the top of that building.
[94:10.95]There's no, like, fight enemies in this DLC so far.
[94:14.14]It's...
[94:15.59]Run away from the guy and fight his dirty, smelly body and then win.
[94:20.99]Find the right way!
[94:25.99]I love how we're playing find the right way.
[94:28.25]No, I want to play fight scary enemies, not find the right tree trunk.
[94:35.19]I'm on tilt right now and it's fucking me up.
[94:37.25]Bad.
[94:52.73]Fucking god.
[94:54.35]Oh.
[94:54.73]My.
[94:55.41]Fucking.
[94:55.91]God.
[94:58.65]Okay, somebody give me the cheat code or just skip this area?
[95:00.33]Because this place sucks, asshole.
[95:03.43]I would rather... Like... We're gonna get real weird right here.
[95:11.63]This boss is gonna make me go crazy.
[95:17.48]These areas take tons of time.
[95:19.77]Summon me, I'm the Chico.
[95:20.79]Just run on the- Don't drop down.
[95:22.27]I'm gonna get lit up by the fucking fireworks display.
[95:27.03]I'm gonna inhale the entire fucking 4th of July if I run straight at him.
[95:33.75]I was about to get real weird.
[95:37.47]I did Shrine of Amanah first try in Dark Souls 2.
[95:41.15]This is way worse than Shrine of Amanah.
[95:42.67]This sucks.
[95:44.45]Shrine of Amana was just stupid.
[95:45.88]This is just annoying.
[95:48.24]Alright, we're going for it.
[95:48.82]I'm just fucking running right into him.
[95:51.32]No, I'm not.
[95:51.66]That's a bad idea.
[95:56.66]You know what?
[95:57.24]You want me to confirm that story?
[95:58.43]Confirm that story with Boo.
[96:00.79]I first tried Shrine of Amana in Dark Souls 2.
[96:04.35]Yeah.
[96:04.99]Yeah.
[96:05.29]Bet you didn't know that.
[96:11.21]Alright, here we go.
[96:15.88]Do it again.
[96:17.60]Do your stupid thing that you do when you curse me.
[96:20.62]That's what I'm waiting for.
[96:29.79]Hang on right here.
[96:31.11]Okay.
[96:31.23]Gotta get to there.
[96:32.21]I'm just gonna drop right down.
[96:33.07]I don't even care.
[96:34.01]Right?
[96:34.79]I think so.
[96:35.17]Here we go.
[96:35.39]Please.
[96:40.49]Please, please.
[96:41.27]McDonald's fucking fries.
[96:42.23]Come on.
[96:42.81]This is for the McDonald's fries.
[96:43.79]This is for the McDonald's fries.
[96:44.71]I did it.
[96:47.20]Did I do it?
[96:51.20]I get all the McDonald's french fries.
[96:52.54]All of them.
[96:54.10]Every single fucking french fry, I get them.
[96:56.62]No matter what they are.
[96:57.14]Oh my god.
[97:02.03]Now what the hell is going on?
[97:08.23]Um... Take the plunge, you won't die.
[97:14.17]Oh.
[97:18.46]I hope I don't die.
[97:19.32]Are we at a boss?
[97:23.35]This looks like a boss fight.
[97:29.15]Okay, this is a boss fight.
[97:30.43]We have to pick a demon in pain and demon from below.
[97:33.85]Okay.
[97:35.31]Well, I'm glad... So, two of them.
[97:45.23]It's as simple as just dodging and I can just go to video game and not get instantly killed.
[97:51.40]Huh.
[97:52.62]I... One of them cast spells, so the theory here is that I'm just going to let this guy come over at me like... That's the theory.
[98:04.80]That guy's heard my theory.
[98:05.72]It's a pretty good theory, I think.
[98:07.62]I'm not sure if you can break this stuff.
[98:16.63]I wonder what I should go for, of course.
[98:18.19]Wait, demon in pain, right?
[98:19.38]I figure the one that's in pain will take more damage and get hurt.
[98:32.30]Oh, lord.
[98:33.10]Oh, lord.
[98:34.10]Oh, my lord.
[98:38.63]And what is with the DLCs in Dark Souls 3 having to fight two fucking bosses at the same time?
[98:43.01]This is a pattern.
[98:53.46]Shit.
[98:57.56]Alright, which one should I... Yeah, I'm gonna... I... Whatever.
[99:01.94]Fire pit thing?
[99:03.20]He's drained.
[99:03.58]He's drained of all energy.
[99:04.30]Get him right in the mouth.
[99:06.18]I mean, the greed is real right here, but okay.
[99:09.80]We're okay.
[99:14.57]That's... not safe.
[99:19.60]And now, wait, now... Okay, I get it, I get it.
[99:21.74]They switch off.
[99:23.58]He now has problems with his digestive system.
[99:26.26]And now he's the one that's coming at me.
[99:30.18]I understand your game here, FromSoftware.
[99:31.84]I get it.
[99:39.08]I think I should just, like, focus on the one that sucks, right?
[99:41.08]Let's try to get inside of each other.
[99:52.14]Once that guy... I switch, alright?
[100:05.89]I really should Ember.
[100:09.21]I'm gonna do this shit, I'm gonna Ember.
[100:15.24]Ember, come on, do it!
[100:19.58]What a fucking dumbass idea that was, huh?
[100:25.62]Nope, I got it.
[100:40.81]Hold up.
[100:44.21]Hold on.
[100:44.57]Ooh, careful, careful, careful, careful.
[100:49.82]We're going with the number one top off here.
[100:56.22]I wanna be able to see the other one.
[101:00.89]The other one has to be in my fucking peripheral, otherwise I'm gonna die.
[101:05.49]Always have them both on camera.
[101:08.07]Oh, come on, this is my chance.
[101:34.16]I'm gonna go for this.
[101:37.40]In fact, I'm gonna have some confidence here.
[101:42.78]Get it on there!
[101:45.04]Lightning strike this motherfucker, you know what I'm saying guys?
[101:55.33]Come on, get over here.
[102:05.87]God bless you.
[102:09.01]God bless you.
[102:14.87]God.
[102:15.15]I'll get this motherfucker right now.
[102:18.59]They're just getting so fucked together.
[102:38.80]I don't think I'm going to do it this time.
[102:44.42]I wasn't prepared.
[102:47.08]I wasn't fully prepared.
[102:53.02]You know what?
[102:53.66]I might just like... Hold on.
[102:58.47]I wish I was on 10th on the tire.
[103:03.09]I feel like this would be a lot easier.
[103:07.95]Yeah, I'm gonna try it again.
[103:11.49]Fuck!
[103:11.77]I wasn't prepared.
[103:16.33]So my theory is... Try to kill one of them as fast as possible.
[103:22.18]Now that I know what to do.
[103:26.72]Gotta like stay up in their ass.
[103:31.00]Not like up their ass.
[103:35.50]I'm gonna Ember too.
[103:38.16]And we're just gonna try to destroy one of them really quickly.
[103:42.54]Solid first try.
[103:43.20]That's the thing with this game, though, is you'll do, like, a solid first try and then you'll never do it again.
[103:47.68]So, I'm just gonna land Gold Pine and just try to... I'm just trying to go ham on somebody.
[103:58.16]I think I got it this time.
[103:59.44]Maybe.
[104:21.13]Why are you so hot about this?
[104:35.24]Why are you so hot?
[104:36.78]What?
[104:36.96]I guess there's something here.
[104:41.68]Are you guys cool off, man?
[104:49.12]Oh, come on.
[104:50.22]Brightlings.
[104:50.64]This guy's burning hot, too.
[104:51.46]Okay.
[104:51.64]Let's go.
[104:58.68]Let's go.
[105:08.15]So far.
[105:08.67]Fuck you.
[105:09.17]I'm coming for you.
[105:10.19]I'm gonna run away.
[105:19.76]It's all about the switch-up.
[105:27.74]At least I had my mic in, doesn't it?
[105:40.32]Here we go.
[105:45.38]Alright, easy, easy.
[105:50.38]No greed here.
[105:51.24]No greed.
[105:52.10]Don't be dumb.
[105:57.66]Which one's on fire?
[105:58.78]Big boy over here?
[106:00.46]Big boy on campus?
[106:02.46]Dead man on campus?
[106:32.77]I don't like it.
[106:33.51]No!
[106:34.05]Shit!
[106:34.51]That's really bad.
[106:35.60]Fuck, I didn't even know that was possible.
[106:37.90]Oh, that's really, really bad.
[106:39.60]That's really bad.
[106:49.34]Didn't even know that was a fucking possibility.
[106:58.09]That was psycho.
[107:06.87]This is actually terrible, this is why I'm gonna lose Can I kill the other one before I die from toxic
[107:36.46]Let's try it.
[108:14.26]Fuck it Y'all might think I'm crazy, but And he's so greedy too, and he's so greedy to get the fucking job done Wait, he's dead.
[108:25.58]He's not dead.
[108:26.14]Why is he not dead?
[108:26.82]What's going on?
[108:27.38]Is it phase two?
[108:29.64]Is it phase two?
[108:31.36]There's a phase two.
[108:32.66]No, there can't be a phase two.
[108:34.43]Just keep hitting him while he's down.
[108:36.41]There's a phase fucking two.
[108:37.87]I hate this.
[108:38.71]Why?
[108:41.87]Fuck that.
[108:42.39]Oh my god.
[108:55.06]Oh my fucking god.
[108:57.39]You've got to be shitting me.
[109:04.12]I'm only doing 166 damage a swing?
[109:10.33]Holy shit, this is unbearable.
[109:14.66]What?
[109:15.80]What?
[109:16.18]166 fucking damage a swing?
[109:19.38]What the fuck is that?
[109:23.99]Why have they been doing this shit lately?
[109:25.77]This game just likes to keep you while you're down.
[109:30.30]Why have they... Why has Farmsuffer been doing this dumb shit with the fucking two or three phase bosses?
[109:37.36]What the fuck?
[109:43.12]I'm gonna try this again.
[109:47.23]I'll give this one more real shot.
[109:51.35]I just realized...
[109:54.94]Second try, unbearable.
[109:58.20]We're going for it with the fucking number.
[110:01.39]Alright, it's gotta be good.
[110:07.53]Hold on.
[110:24.82]Just gotta get one really fucking fast.
[110:29.22]If I have like four... My god.
[110:31.94]I'm gonna instantly die here.
[110:38.51]Are you fucking kidding me?
[110:41.35]Why is that healing me with such dog shit, by the way?
[110:43.29]This is a dead run.
[110:53.55]Like, I say that now, and I'm still just doing this.
[110:55.23]For some reason.
[111:00.66]I don't know, I guess, I don't know.
[111:02.38]I'm just so, so angry.
[111:03.24]Only 10 Estus?
[111:13.62]Plus every target, probably.
[111:15.72]Like, should I have, like, more than that?
[111:19.08]Is that, like, why I can't do this?
[111:22.29]Do I need to go search the whole fucking game for, like, the secret hidden Hester's fucking shards?
[111:28.01]Oh, I forgot, this is Dark Souls, yes.
[111:37.63]He's dying.
[111:38.05]Yeah, I'm jamming this into his brain.
[111:40.74]How am I, like, still doing this battle?
[111:55.41]I still have two Estus Shards.
[112:04.64]I guess I've got maybe one attack left.
[112:14.02]That'll stick right up on his chest.
[112:18.88]Alright, his head.
[112:19.46]Come on.
[112:22.84]Frasks.
[112:23.48]Alright, let's see.
[112:28.32]Let's try it again.
[112:29.00]This time I'm not poisoned.
[112:32.14]I have two flasks.
[112:34.59]And I'm embered.
[112:36.39]Alright, here we go.
[112:39.73]Fuck, I... Okay, let's go.
[112:41.05]Here comes the explosion.
[112:44.27]And he hit me with the explosion too.
[112:48.97]Okay, I didn't even know he could do that.
[112:56.09]He just moved.
[112:56.69]Wow!
[112:58.15]What the f- No way!
[112:59.55]I was so far away from that ship.
[113:04.89]I love it to see what he does.
[113:14.32]Alright, what the hell is this room?
[113:15.52]I don't know what this is for.
[113:17.70]He's got two big orbs.
[113:19.60]What is that?
[113:25.40]I guess he just does this and the shit's on fire?
[113:32.30]I guess?
[113:35.24]What is that?
[113:36.50]Now he's got other stuff.
[113:37.27]He's raining down hell from the sky now.
[113:40.27]What the fuck is this?
[113:48.80]I think I need 30 levels to come back here.
[113:50.60]Look at my little dog shit damage I'm doing when I hit him.
[114:02.72]Okay.
[114:03.42]Well, um... Well!
[114:10.64]Okay.
[114:13.38]What's the recommended salt level again?
[114:15.82]Because I'm 90.
[114:19.29]I need to be 120 plus.
[114:23.97]Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[114:31.95]Dude, my like sorcerer is like three levels higher.
[114:35.52]Start the training.
[114:38.18]Well, whatever.
[114:39.82]I need better gear.
[114:43.61]um I like put on like I've become I see I gave up on that last one although I'll give you I'll give you a huge complaint about the Dark Souls 3 DLC I've always hated where
[115:14.25]There's two phases, or three phases for us.
[115:18.75]And having to do the whole thing over again just feels really cheap and annoying.
[115:22.25]This is annoying.
[115:23.03]Oh, it's annoying.
[115:25.61]There's a fire resist.
[115:26.31]I'm wearing, like, a ton of fire resist.
[115:42.39]Is there something about, like, I don't want to do phase one again.
[115:45.34]Like, I already did phase one.
[115:50.10]Like, why do I have to do phase one, like, five times?
[115:52.22]Like, I beat this one already.
[115:53.02]Let me just fight the prince.
[115:57.64]They have such a fucking hard-on for these double boss phase ones in the DLCs to Dark Souls 3.
[116:02.18]Like, I don't understand.
[116:04.36]Every single other FromSoftware game didn't have this many, like, DLC double fucking co-op Mario Party bosses.
[116:27.95]I can hardly hear him, this is so loud I can't turn it down yet, I'll turn it down after
[117:09.01]Guys, please.
[117:12.23]Friend.
[117:13.73]Walk onto him.
[117:14.89]Who do you think I'm trying to target here?
[117:16.35]Like, what do you think I'm trying to do here?
[117:17.91]I just want to look in the other direction for a while.
[117:24.96]He's getting greedy.
[117:37.65]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come back, come back, come back!
[117:39.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come back!
[117:52.27]Right in the head.
[118:00.46]Irritated, sweaty streamer, pretty much.
[118:03.52]Got me, you got me locked on that.
[118:06.03]I kind of like... Lightning Urn.
[118:15.16]I'm just going to do it.
[118:16.55]I don't even care.
[118:18.15]Can this guy even bleed?
[118:19.03]I have no idea.
[118:20.09]He probably doesn't even have any blood.
[118:43.17]I thought he took the fireball.
[118:44.11]I think right now this might be a good chance to hit him.
[119:02.55]I'll just blade if he's a stuffed asshole.
[119:09.35]Come on.
[119:09.63]Come on!
[119:09.83]Come on!
[119:09.99]Do it!
[119:30.00]That was, what the fuck was that shit?
[119:31.46]Did you see that like, home to me?
[119:32.82]That was bullshit.
[119:35.13]That was fucking horrendous.
[119:36.45]Horrendous with a capital D.
[120:06.41]Video game.
[120:07.43]Video game.
[120:09.27]Are you fucking serious?
[120:18.26]I think I got it this time.
[120:19.44]I do.
[120:21.58]I think with the right amount of fucking brain power, I think I can do it this time.
[120:30.69]Mmm.
[120:31.61]Should I go buy?
[120:34.31]I'll turn the volume down too.
[120:39.94]But now it's super low.
[120:43.84]We'll just try it with brain power.
[120:46.42]I can go buy embers.
[120:47.14]I'll be okay.
[120:49.54]We're going to use brain power.
[120:50.44]We're going to try to fight it.
[120:58.95]Thank you.
[120:59.75]I'm trying my best.
[121:07.71]I'm just, like, getting lost here.
[121:11.80]Getting stuck in shit I shouldn't be getting stuck on.
[121:26.20]And...
[121:29.99]And... And... Here he comes, here he comes.
[121:43.48]I think Auto, like, just ripped up something.
[121:45.27]I hear, like, Auto, like, being like, I think he got into, like, the trash.
[121:53.35]I don't like his brain power.
[121:54.41]I don't like where he is right now, either.
[122:08.14]Oh, please.
[122:09.31]I just want to kill this one guy here.
[122:11.39]The ground is shaking.
[122:12.53]It is.
[122:15.39]Let's hit him with a full one.
[122:17.84]That was dumb.
[122:18.26]That was really dumb, but it's okay.
[122:20.36]I'm dumb.
[122:24.32]Just kill this one dumb guy.
[122:27.63]Come on.
[122:31.16]I went right through his legs.
[122:33.48]Come on!
[122:35.58]Come on!
[122:36.68]He's not gonna do that shit to me.
[122:37.92]Alright, six flasks.
[122:46.83]I need more flasks too.
[122:47.89]Fuck.
[122:48.27]Let's get some stamina.
[122:57.67]Try it again.
[123:04.05]One, two, three.
[123:08.19]Watch out.
[123:11.59]And a one.
[123:14.43]This is turning into a decent attempt.
[123:16.71]It is.
[123:18.62]Decent attempt here.
[123:20.56]Very decent attempt.
[123:25.00]Just don't get hit.
[123:26.50]Alright, here we go.
[123:28.78]Let me get my shit.
[123:30.55]Decent, decent, decent, decent.
[123:31.71]Come on.
[123:36.57]Hold on a second.
[123:40.22]Hold on.
[123:41.34]I'm muting.
[124:06.92]Oh.
[124:58.19]I gotta take a break.
[124:59.11]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[125:00.94]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[125:01.82]Beerby!
[125:45.90]Wait, what?
[127:01.01]I thought that said BRB.
[127:07.45]I thought that shit said beam right back.
[127:11.09]I thought it said BRB black screen.
[127:13.09]No, it's just my credit card number.
[127:19.06]I guess I'll be right back.
[127:20.06]It's my credit card number.
[127:21.88]What the fuck?
[127:23.20]That was my made up credit card number from like fucking like a joke stream.
[127:29.18]That shit ain't real.
[127:32.34]Why would somebody do that?
[127:34.56]Hey, guys.
[127:35.10]Yeah, hold on.
[127:35.52]I gotta be right back.
[127:36.92]Yeah, during that whole last attempt... Uh, Otto was, like... Doing a bunch of bad shit.
[127:42.80]And, uh... I had to, like, pay attention to that.
[127:46.48]So... Sorry.
[127:48.15]Everything is fine, though.
[127:50.67]Uh, I'm going to... I don't know.
[127:57.85]Should I put on the slime weapon?
[128:02.37]What do you think?
[128:05.07]I kind of want to use the bugger weapon.
[128:09.21]And we're going to use different armor, too.
[128:15.86]Does that just count as physical damage, or is it fire damage, too?
[128:22.72]Is it time for a summon?
[128:23.60]No, not yet.
[128:24.46]Not yet.
[128:28.27]I'm getting closer.
[128:30.24]I am.
[128:30.96]I'll probably be able to do it with the booger weapon.
[128:35.71]There's no way the booger knife will work?
[128:37.25]I'm going to have to prove this guy wrong.
[128:39.33]I'm going to prove you wrong, man.
[128:46.29]I wonder if I should just keep this shit on.
[128:53.76]I mean, this is better, sort of.
[129:00.79]24 29 26 25 Am I still okay with rolls here?
[129:31.48]Yeah, if I take off the katana, right?
[129:34.28]Yeah.
[129:35.60]What about shields?
[129:40.38]I don't think... Okay, 57.
[129:42.04]52.
[129:42.06]65.
[129:45.43]I mean, I have this one, but I can't wear it.
[129:52.05]I can have this one, too.
[129:53.61]28.
[129:53.63]How am I doing?
[130:03.99]I'm still alright.
[130:10.42]Although, don't you need to actually be using the weapon?
[130:15.56]Like, doesn't it need to be actually used?
[130:17.64]No, we're going to do more than one more attempt.
[130:20.08]I just want to see if I can do it with this.
[130:23.64]We're going to try the booger sword.
[130:24.72]The Nickelodeon slime sword has done very good things for me in the past.
[130:29.21]So we're going to try it.
[130:31.13]Alright, Nickelodeon.
[130:33.40]A secret slime action.
[130:48.69]Now I'm toxic.
[130:51.37]Yeah.
[130:52.81]Unfortunately, this is the shit that happens to me when I play this game.
[130:55.03]I'm just gonna die.
[130:56.41]Just kill me.
[130:57.37]This thing actually is doing better than the katana, but... I get, like, so sick of fighting the same boss that I just throw every time.
[131:12.01]This is the Rotten Grue dagger, yes.
[131:13.12]We're just gonna do it again.
[131:16.72]When you start that poorly, you gotta start again.
[131:19.56]Yeah.
[131:21.06]It would also help if I wasn't a dex build.
[131:23.62]I know, but the only other character I have is sorcery.
[131:27.92]So, I mean, sorcery... Maybe sorcery would be good here.
[131:33.28]Maybe.
[131:40.79]I just like... Yeah, we're starting again.
[131:43.69]Do it again.
[131:44.53]Just kill me again.
[131:47.09]Ahhhh.
[131:53.26]It also doesn't help that I'm potentially 10 to 20 levels underleveled for this area.
[131:59.44]That doesn't help either.
[132:04.43]Sorcery's never good.
[132:10.79]It might actually be worth just grinding and putting like 5 to 10 points in.
[132:18.73]I'm not underleveled, isn't it 100 plus?
[132:21.92]Excuses?
[132:22.48]That is an excuse, but it's a pretty valid one.
[132:42.30]Where is this camera fucking taking me right now, really?
[132:55.47]Damn it.
[132:55.85]No.
[132:56.55]No.
[132:58.21]No, it's no good.
[133:00.03]I think I've expelled all my energy to fight this boss.
[133:09.48]Don't you just love when your camera's inside of both bosses at the same time?
[133:12.85]I love that shit.
[133:35.05]I run into this string of terrible attempts, and then I'll do another really good one.
[133:39.23]And I might get it.
[133:40.27]On one of those times when I do a really good one, I might get it.
[133:43.90]But I might have to just call this right now to track it.
[133:47.30]Yeah, I'm going to call it.
[133:56.95]It's over.
[133:57.63]Do you see how well I was doing at these guys before?
[134:01.55]And now it's just unimaginable.
[134:03.51]I can't even do it.
[134:06.48]You get so locked into trying to do something, and you come close, and then you have to do it all over again, and it's just like, I don't want to do that again.
[134:19.27]Alright, this is the one.
[134:20.03]No more fucking around.
[134:20.69]We're gonna get it this time.
[134:21.83]I'm gonna get to phase two again.
[134:24.24]No more fucking around.
[134:26.34]Let's go.
[134:28.52]I'm about to take my clothes off, by the way.
[134:55.79]Hello, you.
[134:58.57]Oh, that guy.
[134:59.89]Okay.
[135:04.15]I haven't been able to get one dead in five fucking attempts.
[135:13.94]This is like, I'll just throw the fucking deck of cards in the air.
[135:18.30]Because, like, I can't even get one to half health now.
[135:20.54]Oh, yeah.
[135:28.31]These pants are fucking coming off.
[135:30.47]This shit.
[135:33.23]Pants have to fucking come off in this shirt, too.
[135:34.91]Let's go.
[135:40.61]I'm, like, tangled up in my cord.
[135:41.67]It's, like, helping.
[136:07.97]What the fuck just comes out of nowhere every time, huh?
[136:09.71]Why are you both so fired up right now?
[136:19.41]Am I missing something here?
[136:21.65]I think I am.
[136:26.10]He's, like, drained.
[136:32.02]That's not a good place to be laying there.
[136:47.03]Did he actually hit me with that shit?
[137:11.28]I can't tell if this actually is better than the Katana or not.
[137:13.56]I don't think it is.
[137:14.88]I wish I could see.
[137:16.48]Alright.
[137:33.92]One down, right?
[137:34.74]Let's go.
[137:35.16]Come on.
[137:45.87]Thank you for letting me just do this, by the way, you fucking dumbass.
[138:03.42]Come on, let me get a good attempt here.
[138:04.80]Alright, good attempt.
[138:12.92]We're doing an Ember.
[138:13.94]That's six.
[138:15.50]Come on, Booker Sword.
[138:16.38]Give me some real shit here.
[138:17.49]Alright, here we go.
[138:44.79]Less damage.
[139:01.79]Gotta get closer.
[139:08.30]Great.
[139:22.39]Here comes, here comes Armageddon.
[139:23.45]God damn it, give me a fucking break.
[139:27.27]Like, that shit is so, so fucking stupid.
[139:34.19]It's like, they just go in fucking random directions fucking everywhere.
[139:40.81]How are you ever supposed to know what to do there?
[139:44.37]If these gigantic fucking explosion bombs just appear everywhere.
[139:49.87]And it happens fucking that quick.
[139:51.63]God.
[139:52.23]Damn.
[139:56.52]Interrupt the Spirit Bomb?
[139:57.32]Well, when I'm across the map, I can't get there fast enough.
[140:07.48]I just can't even see.
[140:22.12]God, I'm getting hit by everything now.
[140:23.78]Like, I fucking hate this boss.
[140:49.92]I should have listened to the instruction manual and came here at 120.
[140:52.37]Come here, you sack of shit.
[141:29.92]Here comes another red hot guy Damn it Seal
[142:09.53]I was trying to dodge and I just didn't do it.
[142:12.11]I tried to press the button.
[142:22.40]I got pretty softy at this DLC yesterday.
[142:24.36]Whoa, look at me!
[142:26.94]I am as fucking softy as you can be.
[142:28.80]Because the fucking Lord knows I'm sick of these two-phase DLC bosses that they've had in the last two fucking packs.
[142:39.98]Shit is just fucking irritating.
[142:43.36]And now I'm toxic.
[142:43.96]Will you two get away from each other?
[142:51.92]Get the fuck away from each other, please!
[143:06.10]I'm not salty yet, I haven't made it to the second area.
[143:12.49]Okay, just tell me.
[143:13.93]Is every fucking boss in this DLC a two-phase, fight two people at the same time boss?
[143:19.57]Because if it is, I want to fucking burn the disk.
[143:26.13]I'm so sick of that shit.
[143:31.34]Alright, we're doing a new game plan here.
[143:40.58]Uh, I need to level up.
[143:41.96]Like, at least five times.
[143:50.33]I'm leveling up five fucking times before I come back here.
[143:57.10]So, we're gonna go back.
[144:04.18]I'm gonna go here.
[144:11.93]Nine phase boss.
[144:19.02]Oh no, I didn't want to go here.
[144:25.64]I want to go here.
[144:31.53]I have to beat him.
[144:32.21]Oh, I just, I need to level up.
[144:35.01]I need like five levels.
[144:40.44]I'm just doing myself a disservice by not being, like, level 100.
[144:43.35]Or even close to that.
[144:53.29]Freed with three phases?
[144:54.37]Yeah.
[144:55.81]How did I not light this fucking bonfire?
[145:09.46]Somebody just gave me a hundred bucks.
[145:13.34]Juicy.
[145:16.91]Listen to me, son.
[145:17.85]I'm your dad.
[145:18.41]Destroy him.
[145:21.71]Oh my god.
[145:22.61]Well, now I have to beat this guy.
[145:28.07]Somebody just gave me a hundred dollars.
[145:29.39]I have to beat this guy.
[145:34.44]Thank you for the fucking one hundo, dude.
[145:38.47]Now I have to fucking beat this guy.
[145:41.53]Now I gotta win.
[145:42.79]I have to.
[145:45.97]Thank you, Reaper, as well, for the $4.
[145:48.39]Here's the rest of the $5 I didn't give you first.
[145:50.63]Well, thanks for the $5.
[145:51.59]Don't fuck it up.
[145:56.12]I have to do it for the money.
[145:59.34]Yeah.
[145:59.84]I have to beat this guy because somebody paid me to do it.
[146:08.74]Mmm.
[146:08.96]Alright, let's we skipped through this whole thing.
[146:11.78]Let's just try to get kills and Get echoes and level up a few times because God knows I need to do that 100 I need like 50,000 souls We're actually gonna take off the book a weapon it's not the booger weapon is not really doing as much favors at the moment Where's the uji katana?
[146:39.18]Uji Katana, I think, is just going to be better for this situation.
[146:42.02]I also want Gold Pine.
[146:43.62]It's a little bit more damage with the Katana.
[147:01.01]I'll be ready for a grind stream.
[147:02.39]Okay, so let's not just skip through the whole thing.
[147:10.11]Let's go down.
[147:10.73]What the fuck?
[147:22.22]I jumped with Luigi's Mansion.
[147:23.32]Remember that joke?
[147:24.60]I can't even think about jokes right now.
[147:25.82]I'm so angry.
[147:34.12]This thing's still alive.
[147:35.20]But it's okay.
[147:40.27]Because I know now that I can get rid of it by killing that stupid exoskeleton thing.
[147:45.43]That's alright.
[147:47.47]That's cool.
[147:53.51]Oh, I forgot about this.
[147:54.81]These two idiots.
[147:55.47]I was trying to be cheeky right there.
[148:03.77]Didn't really help me.
[148:08.43]Trying to be cheeky there again, too.
[148:12.96]You guys have to be separated.
[148:14.88]Come on.
[148:22.82]I knew eventually you were going to put that shield down.
[148:24.57]And I'm going to die.
[148:35.75]Wait.
[148:38.21]What the fuck was that, dude?
[148:39.95]What was I thinking?
[148:40.73]What am I doing right now?
[148:41.67]I don't know.
[148:52.49]What am I doing?
[148:53.83]Don't heal, please.
[149:00.23]Please.
[149:04.39]Okay.
[149:05.09]I got an Ember back.
[149:07.77]chunks.
[149:08.11]I could sell these chunks, too.
[149:10.79]Probably should do that.
[149:14.02]Sell these things away.
[149:15.40]What is this?
[149:20.96]Oh, yeah.
[149:21.98]This thing.
[149:27.26]Alright, so instead of sprinting by this whole thing, let's find...

[150:29.50]Anything else?
[150:30.00]Alright, cool.
[150:30.76]So who knows what the hell he does?
[151:00.19]The thing is, this is too high, and this is too low.
[151:06.84]It's kind of strange.
[151:18.62]Watch out for the fucking boogeyman.
[151:20.16]What the hell are you?
[151:26.73]What the hell are you?
[151:28.27]Any spare Humanities?

[151:56.44]And it ended up hurting me when I landed on the ground.
[152:00.19]Come on.
[152:01.17]That's not fair.
[152:07.41]Please get... What is happening to my body?
[152:11.18]Somebody just...
[152:40.15]This shit is fucking too much.
[152:47.69]I'm going back to the shrine and I'm going to see if I can infuse my weapon.
[152:52.49]Just why do I feel like I'm such a fucking weakling?
[152:57.32]I just wanted to get souls.
[153:02.74]This DLC requires two people to play the game.
[153:06.64]I need another person here holding the other side of the controller.
[153:19.21]Where's the fucking, like, sharp gem?
[153:20.53]I don't think I even have a sharp gem.
[153:24.75]No, I have a raw, refined... Dude, I'm not even sure I have the coal required to have him do that.
[153:45.14]Use the washing pole.
[153:46.82]I've been told to do that.
[153:48.37]I have... But I don't even think I have access to it anymore.
[154:00.51]No, I don't even have to call.
[154:01.62]I never got it in my first playthrough.
[154:03.06]This is my first playthrough character, guys.
[154:06.92]It's in Farron Keep, right?
[154:18.05]Oh, W. You get 50 bucks?
[154:19.77]When did that happen?
[154:20.79]I didn't even see it.

[154:26.78]Yeah, you did.
[154:27.88]Wow.
[154:30.41]Well, W2474, thank you for the $50.
[154:35.00]Much appreciated.

[155:33.71]Yeah.
[155:33.87]I just don't know what bonfire it is.
[155:42.06]Not here, though, right?
[155:42.92]Isn't there another bonfire?
[155:46.56]Um, I forget where that is.
[155:47.95]Let's see.
[155:54.33]Over here.

[156:08.20]This way.
[156:12.31]Yeah, right.
[156:18.86]Alright, let's go get the coal that I never got on this character.
[156:22.04]Or do I get chased by the werewolf?
[156:23.82]I think I get chased by two werewolves and die.
[156:29.17]No, thankfully I'm like, overleveled for this place.
[156:36.52]Oh, dude, you know what I mean?
[156:38.02]Like, fucking, that's life, right?
[156:39.90]Hey, that's life.
[156:41.50]Over-leveled for the first player so that I want to go under-leveled for the place I've already been.
[156:45.91]Know what I'm saying?
[156:46.87]Like, fuck, dude, that's life.
[156:48.61]Just can't be right where I want to be at the right part of the game.
[156:51.63]Over-leveled?
[156:52.25]You're way too qualified for the job?
[156:54.04]Or, wait, hold on a second, by the way.
[156:56.02]I have a story to tell you guys about what happened today.
[156:58.56]So, um...
[157:01.13]Just get out of the fucking way.
[157:03.31]I don't want to fight you.
[157:04.20]I just want to grab the cult.
[157:06.80]When I have a second, I want to tell a story about when I called my health insurance company.
[157:12.42]This is great shit.
[157:13.32]You guys are going to love this shit.
[157:16.93]So, have I even fought this guy?
[157:20.23]I'm not sure I even attacked this guy once.
[157:22.39]I just gave up.
[157:28.95]Where's my, like, 3% chance to get the best weapon in the game, right?
[157:33.73]Okay.
[157:34.81]Let's go put this coal in.
[157:36.64]Um... So I called my health insurance company.
[157:41.92]Because my prescription, for some reason, was fucking 700 bucks was what I had to pay.
[157:50.77]I didn't pay it, because I thought that I was like, holy shit, what the fuck is this?
[157:53.57]Like, are you kidding me?
[157:55.37]I didn't pay it.
[157:57.01]So I called because it wasn't like that before.
[157:59.01]I'm going to get this item, too.
[158:01.26]Shit wasn't like that before, so I give a call.
[158:03.38]I get in touch with somebody.
[158:04.20]They go, oh, yes, Mr. Harrington.
[158:06.28]Yes, we can figure this out for you.
[158:07.78]What the hell is wrong with you?
[158:09.30]So what's the problem?
[158:10.42]It was too expensive.
[158:11.64]Yeah, it was a little too expensive.
[158:12.76]Okay.
[158:13.62]So what I'm going to do here is we're going to see if there's a generic available for that particular drug.
[158:18.78]Great.
[158:19.20]I'm looking forward to that.
[158:19.92]So you're going to look that up on your computer?
[158:21.71]Just wait one second.
[158:22.51]I'm going to call our pharmacy department, and we're going to do a three-way call.
[158:26.03]Is that okay, Mr. Harrington?
[158:28.09]Yeah, that's fine.
[158:29.67]Okay, just give me one second.
[158:34.83]Yes, this is the CVS Pharmacare prescription line.
[158:38.08]Hi, yes, I'm calling because Mr. Harrington here.
[158:41.14]Is Mr. Harrington still there?
[158:43.16]Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.
[158:44.20]Oh, Mr. Harrington's looking to see if there's a generic version of the drug that he's currently taking.
[158:47.46]It's this, X, Y, Z, blah, blah, blah.
[158:49.28]Oh, yeah, there might be.
[158:51.83]Can I put you on a three-way call?
[158:53.99]This person that we three-way called called somebody else on a three-way call.
[158:57.97]So we were double three-way calling, and there was a fucking crowd of people talking to each other.
[159:01.87]Well, yes, that does exist.
[159:03.35]Thank you for calling the Super Care Helpline.
[159:06.83]Literally three fucking three-way calls happened at the same time, and nobody even knew who was talking to them.
[159:11.99]It got to a point where I was sitting in fucking call, just being like, listening to these people all talk to each other and not me.
[159:18.70]It was fucking crazy.
[159:21.48]Eventually, they, like, said bye, and, like, somebody would hang up.
[159:25.54]Okay, yeah, that sounds great, uh, Janet, uh, thank you for giving me that information, talk to you later, bye!
[159:30.08]And I'm like, bye!
[159:32.00]Does it... Does that mean I hang up too?
[159:37.07]No, she's like, oh, you still there?
[159:38.13]Like, yeah.
[159:39.85]Like, why the fuck are you three?
[159:40.83]Where is the bonfire?
[159:44.06]It was fucking crazy.
[159:45.30]I, like, forgot about it the second after it happened.
[159:48.70]Am I about to homeward bone right now?
[159:50.00]It's, like, right here.
[159:50.56]This is fucking whack-ass food.
[159:58.01]I seriously, like, I start telling stories and I fucking don't even know where I am.
[160:00.73]I'm just going up here.
[160:03.19]Did I get it all sorted out?
[160:04.19]Uh, no.
[160:04.83]Actually, no.
[160:09.40]Real life Metal Gear Solid codec call.
[160:10.94]That's what it felt like.
[160:11.62]It really did.
[160:13.46]It was a real life Metal Gear Solid call.
[160:16.38]What's going on?
[160:17.06]He's being crazy.
[160:24.26]Sorry that my pants are off.
[160:25.70]They have to be.
[160:28.66]But they're kind of off.
[160:31.68]Why can I not get out of here?
[160:34.33]Do I have to, like, fight something?
[160:35.61]I don't get it.
[160:36.25]Oh, no, I'm not feeling better at all.
[160:37.93]Like, we went to this, like, hack restaurant.
[160:40.28]I wanted to, like, have fun.
[160:44.02]It was very fucking bad.
[160:44.74]It was really bad.
[160:47.26]It was actually really bad.
[160:48.86]Why can I not fucking leave?
[160:53.03]There was, like, one mob there, like, down the street.
[160:56.21]Alright.
[160:57.05]No, we can't free Otto because he was eating young soy sauce.
[161:00.02]He was eating cat shit, if you must know.
[161:02.30]That's fucking disgusting, dog.
[161:06.24]You lack the license for this DLC returning to title menu.
[161:09.17]What the fuck is happening right now?
[161:13.13]What just fucking happened?
[161:15.65]Did I just get banned from Dark Souls 3?
[161:22.31]What just happened?
[161:23.11]That didn't just happen, did it?
[161:30.61]I'm gonna fucking throw up if that happened.
[161:35.35]I don't have a license for Dark Souls 3.
[161:42.10]I've never had that happen before.
[161:43.28]That, like... Okay.
[161:45.34]That was really weird.
[161:46.22]That was fucking weird.
[161:49.60]Alright.
[161:51.02]I have the coal now.
[161:51.66]Let's go do this.
[161:52.24]I heard you talking shit.
[161:54.50]Yeah.
[161:54.80]Well, that's... Unfortunately for them.
[161:58.80]Hey, don't worry.
[161:59.48]They'll be fine.
[162:01.03]You complained too much.
[162:01.91]They'll be fine.
[162:02.71]They're making lots of money.
[162:03.65]They're making, like, three more games.
[162:05.87]They have, like, four games in development right now.
[162:08.01]They have, like, Dark Souls 4.
[162:09.19]Yeah, right.
[162:10.03]This isn't the end.
[162:11.49]I refuse to believe that.
[162:13.81]They're just saying that so everybody, like, doesn't freak out.
[162:15.83]Dark Souls 4 is getting announced, like, next month.
[162:17.87]Okay, here, give it to Cole.
[162:21.83]Now, let me do this.
[162:23.11]What if I don't even have a sharp gem?
[162:24.89]I hope I do.
[162:28.58]He was doing it again?
[162:31.09]We're going to have to move it.
[162:32.31]The box is being a fucking weirdo.
[162:33.89]Is that even worth doing?
[162:34.87]230?
[162:35.01]I'm not really gaining anything, am I?
[162:36.99]If I put sharp in here?
[162:39.45]You've been banned if you want it back and you need to be in a three-way call.
[162:59.55]Um, well... Worth it for the sub 20 plus damage.
[163:06.39]Is it really just only 20 damage?
[163:07.66]I guess.
[163:11.06]Scaling goes up, but that's like... I guess I'll just do it.
[163:16.66]Whatever.
[163:18.78]Why do I lose physical damage on that though?
[163:22.86]Is it because it's bringing my scaling for strength down or something?
[163:29.19]Need more decks.
[163:31.73]This character sucks.
[163:33.89]It's like plus 10.
[163:36.07]Let's see.
[163:36.91]30.
[163:36.93]12.
[163:36.95]15.
[163:37.15]It's a little bit.
[163:40.71]Okay.
[163:40.89]I'm just going to do it.
[163:42.41]Let's see.
[163:45.98]Let's take a look at it now.
[163:47.22]212.
[163:47.24]178.
[163:47.96]I think I gained 9 damage or something.
[164:00.74]Refine might be better.
[164:02.30]Yeah, he's a fucking dingus.
[164:07.56]Alright, we're gonna try this again.
[164:10.60]I'm just gonna go for it.
[164:18.25]Time to make a new character.
[164:19.07]Yeah, time to make a new character and get it to level 100 so I can do the DLC again.
[164:21.97]Now, I'm gonna give this another couple attempts, and if I can't get it, then I might just have to throw the towel in.
[164:31.56]10 levels isn't going to do dick because of the diminishing returns.
[164:34.43]Yeah, but still, like, health just, like, points into HP and defense.
[164:38.97]You just get defense by putting points in, right?
[164:40.63]That doesn't ever stop.
[164:44.05]Oh, actually, no, I wanted to buy a couple things here.
[164:46.30]I wanted to buy some lightning shit.
[164:54.26]Especially typical behavior for dogs.
[164:55.82]Yeah.
[164:56.56]Especially him.
[164:57.14]He's just like... If he gets something he's not supposed to have, he just loses his mind.
[165:01.52]I have 40 decks at the moment.
[165:04.64]Congrats on finally getting there.
[165:06.08]Thank you, Irish guy.
[165:07.88]Well, I haven't done anything yet.
[165:10.68]I haven't finally gotten really anywhere.
[165:12.08]No, it's okay like this.
[165:17.01]As long as I don't turn my webcam on, I won't get permanently banned from the website.
[165:20.19]So it's okay.
[165:23.50]Okay, purchase item.
[165:28.33]I don't have enough.
[165:31.11]I want some gold pine.
[165:32.09]Alright, Mrs. Harrington's gonna go upstairs now.
[165:36.37]Mrs. Mrs. Harrington.
[165:38.35]That's like what Diane kept calling me.
[165:41.49]Oh, yes, Mrs. Harrington.
[165:43.71]I'm married now, guys.
[165:44.93]Mrs. Harrington.
[165:47.25]There she is.
[165:48.49]It was a solid what?
[165:52.98]Oh, he's talking about the webcam.
[165:58.20]Turn on the webcam and, like, get me permanently banned.
[166:01.70]Yeah, they, like, freaking freaked out about it.
[166:06.01]Alright, let's do this.
[166:07.53]Let's fucking... I have some gold pine.
[166:09.85]I want to try to utilize that.
[166:12.01]Washing pole is 15 durability.
[166:14.17]I know, that sucks.
[166:17.92]But... Go see the guy at the second bonfire.
[166:25.02]Why?
[166:25.26]I already did, didn't I?
[166:26.64]Listen, if I were actually to marry Jeremy, I wouldn't take his last name, so don't worry about that.
[166:31.36]Stupid!
[166:33.63]I would never take your last name.
[166:35.07]Stupid!
[166:37.95]Alright, let's go.
[166:38.93]Let's do it.
[166:42.09]Why can I not move?
[166:49.40]Treasure.
[166:49.84]Okay, he gave me like a beer.
[166:51.62]Okay.
[166:51.80]Sure.
[167:18.66]Mr. and Mrs. Stupid.
[167:23.33]Oh, I am Mrs. Harrington.
[167:29.22]I can summon him as a boss, bro.
[167:30.76]Okay.
[167:32.84]No, I just need to get my shit together and just go for it.
[167:36.19]This might not be the most well-optimized character there is.
[167:40.61]But, you know, it is what it is.
[167:43.07]I'm going to just... It's got to be good.
[167:45.31]I got to get this off the bar.
[167:49.30]Let me see here.
[167:53.68]I want some gold pine.
[167:54.69]I want to use this at the second phase.
[168:01.29]And we just have to go.
[168:02.27]We just have to try.
[168:02.99]I mean, how many... I'm missing flasks, but... I don't even... Guys, here's the problem.
[168:08.60]Even if I wanted to go get, like, 15 flasks, I don't even know where they are.
[168:12.88]I don't even know where the fuck they are.
[168:18.73]Get married on stream.
[168:24.25]I don't know about that.
[168:26.75]Okay, let's try.
[168:27.37]It's gonna be loud.
[168:28.03]Sorry.
[168:28.47]Loud.
[168:42.79]Thinking I knew what's gonna happen
[169:01.46]Oh shit
[169:57.90]toxic too fuck me fuck me
[170:10.43]That's gonna really cause problems for me.
[170:26.97]Even in pain, we're toxic.
[170:39.71]I'm in trouble.
[170:43.95]By the way, I think I'm doing less damage.
[171:01.61]I was 360.
[171:02.25]I was doing more than 360, right?
[171:23.24]I mean, it might be possible if I just am a psychopath.
[171:26.43]You know what I mean?
[171:27.19]I might just be a psycho.
[171:28.01]Let's try to be a psycho.
[171:33.87]Time to be a psycho.
[171:39.85]I, like, seriously was not... That's bullshit.
[172:11.51]Oh, I just need so many more things I just don't have enough of I don't have enough Estus flasks.
[172:16.46]I don't have enough shards and I don't do enough damage Those are three things like those are three reasons why you fucking can't beat a boss in Dark Souls.
[172:25.53]Oh
[172:30.48]It was a dead run when I got hit by the fucking Toxic.
[172:33.50]That's it.
[172:33.80]Alright, this is my last try.
[172:37.35]Last attempt alone.
[172:39.05]And I'm bringing somebody in.
[172:41.33]This character just sucks ass.
[172:43.87]Like, to a point where it's not even fun.
[173:10.73]I'm waiting for you to get expended here.

[179:12.35]God damn, Daddy.
[179:14.37]Oh, God.
[179:15.15]I take back every awful thing I said.
[179:17.27]It's so satisfying when you actually beat something in this game.
[179:30.38]Thank you, Good Burger, for the 10 bucks.
[179:36.55]I really thought I was going to lose it there.
[179:40.95]Oh, my God.
[179:43.34]And that's, like, just the beginning of this fucking dumbass DLC.
[179:49.21]Uh, a wizard just gave 80 bucks.

[180:09.34]I'm 39.
[180:09.48]I'm 39.
[180:12.07]I'm a pretty big father figure.
[180:13.21]You know what I'm saying?
[180:16.01]But thank you, Wizard, for the 80 bucks.
[180:18.11]Thank you, Good Burger, for the 10 bucks.
[180:19.50]Says, yes, daddy.
[180:21.22]No, that's not what I meant.
[180:22.42]I meant, like, do it for daddy.
[180:23.88]Remember Paul Bearer?
[180:26.14]When Paul Bearer's like, just do it.
[180:27.60]Listen to me, son.
[180:28.54]Like, do it for daddy.
[180:30.30]That was doing a Paul Bearer thing.
[180:33.48]I am a father figure.
[180:34.58]Yes, I am.
[180:36.54]Of course I am.
[180:40.30]I am a father figure.

[181:10.85]Dude, I swear to God, like, I've said this before during my, like, actual Dark Souls 3 playthrough.
[181:17.66]Small envoy banner.
[181:21.00]When you're not doing well and you don't think you're going to be able to do it on stream, it sucks.
[181:28.04]I'm just sitting there going, like, I can't do it.
[181:30.90]Like, I can't get past phase one.
[181:32.68]I get, like, so mad and tired and...
[181:36.50]I'm not gonna be able to do this on stream and everyone's gonna think I'm, like, bad.
[181:40.58]I'm not gonna be- I'm not gonna do it.
[181:43.44]That happens.
[181:44.48]You get in your own head in this game so badly.
[181:47.52]But I fucking love it.
[181:52.12]Okay.
[181:53.70]So I get more dex scaling.
[181:54.90]Should I dump into dex because I have the sharp jump?
[182:01.31]Don't you know you beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
[182:03.95]Yes, I did.
[182:09.09]Can all 2,000 of... No, I'm not going to read that one.
[182:15.48]You did it, though.
[182:17.32]Yeah, I know.
[182:19.88]So bad.
[182:20.60]How many times did I die to that boss?
[182:26.78]And look, let's count, like... Let's not count the ones where I just, like, threw.
[182:31.46]Because I knew it wasn't going to work in the first ten seconds.
[182:34.38]Ten times?
[182:34.88]Like, eight times?
[182:35.44]I can't wait to tell my friends.
[182:40.40]My dad beat the Demon Prince.
[182:45.72]How much is this going to give me?
[182:48.08]Like, twelve?
[182:48.62]Ten?
[182:52.46]Um...
[182:55.80]Soul of... I haven't even crushed this.
[182:58.64]What do these even do?
[182:59.38]We're going to use these.
[183:03.38]This will get me to like... Yeah.
[183:09.33]Get my strength to 21.
[183:10.61]Should I do that?
[183:11.91]Should I?
[183:17.13]One more of these and I should be good.
[183:22.51]Level up like three times now.
[183:25.85]I can do it and see what I need.
[183:28.86]One, two, I need two thousand more.
[183:34.56]No, don't do that.
[183:38.24]I haven't even crushed this, I haven't.
[183:41.66]Let's see what I can get with this, though.
[183:44.84]It might be time to actually retire the Uchi Kitana.
[183:49.17]I think so.
[183:50.87]I died 30 times to Fume Knight in Dark Souls 2.
[183:55.65]Sometimes a boss just gives you trouble.
[183:57.46]Guys, I beat Champion Gundyr on my first try.
[184:00.38]And I died to Crystal Sage like 30 fucking times.
[184:05.66]So, Crystal Sage is the easiest boss in Dark Souls 3.
[184:10.08]Maybe like Yhorm the Giant is easier.
[184:12.66]I died more than 15 to 20 times to Crystal Sage on stream.
[184:17.09]And I went the wrong way again.
[184:26.26]Champion Gunder is piss easy.
[184:27.44]I beat Dancer first try too, didn't I?
[184:28.83]Okay.
[184:33.85]Soul of the Demon Prince is just an explosion.
[184:35.71]Pyromancy.
[184:36.82]It's a miracle.
[184:37.54]I don't need any of that.
[184:38.36]What about this?
[184:39.46]Firelink Greatsword.
[184:41.96]Or Demon Scar.
[184:43.12]That thing's cool looking.
[184:46.31]Yeah.
[184:53.40]I heard this guy beat Dark Souls 3, so he can't have died 14 times to Demon Prince.
[185:00.40]Is this to Freed's Greatscythe?
[185:02.65]Damn.
[185:05.41]Am I going to stream Overwatch anytime soon?
[185:06.85]No.
[185:08.43]Probably not.
[185:14.18]um what do you guys think should I just crush these up and level up a bunch of times yeah normal gun deer is easy normal gun deer is is I mean he's the first boss he's in the game I'm gonna crush these up I don't want these things do I hate Overwatch no hate Overwatch
[185:39.79]Alright, I'm gonna dump two points into... I'm gonna go two points into Endurance.
[185:47.70]And then one into Dexterity.
[185:52.10]So, once this gets to 50, that's game over, though.
[185:58.17]Don't do it.
[185:58.61]What do you mean, don't do it?
[186:02.03]All the soul weapons are, like, terrible.
[186:04.39]I want a soul weapon.
[186:13.32]I should get the scythes.
[186:16.48]Should I?
[186:20.84]Well, I mean, what... Should I get Freed's weapon?
[186:26.77]Is it really that good?
[186:29.53]It's that good.
[186:36.13]I should get this?
[186:39.87]Scythe is a crazy combo.
[186:41.11]Just get it and just fucking get this thing to plus ten.
[186:47.58]I mean, I don't have like any intelligence though.
[186:56.85]I'll like do something different as long as it'll work on my build.
[186:59.39]I don't think those sides will work for me.
[187:03.15]Don't know.
[187:04.91]Freed side is the best dex weapon.
[187:07.17]You don't have the stat requirements.
[187:08.31]Yeah, I need like... It's not worth it.
[187:11.67]Stop listening.
[187:12.63]You do, you...
[187:17.20]Well, if I'm gonna do me, that means I'm crushing all these.
[187:20.64]In fact, don't even listen to me.
[187:24.24]Alright, we're fucking doing a crush spree.
[187:33.03]Respec.
[187:33.63]I mean, I could respec.
[187:35.36]I haven't done it once.
[187:37.12]How do I respec?
[187:42.58]Respec and get the fucking scythe?
[187:45.30]How do I respec?
[187:46.84]Who respecs you?
[187:50.01]What time zone am I in?
[187:53.15]Where am I?
[187:54.33]What's happening?
[187:59.85]Turning in some coupons.
[188:00.69]How do I do that?
[188:01.57]Don't.
[188:16.39]I'm getting so many people like, don't do it!
[188:25.70]Stop listening.
[188:26.20]Yeah, alright.
[188:27.28]Here's what we're gonna do.
[188:31.62]I'm crushing this shit.
[188:33.08]That's what I'm gonna do.
[188:36.17]So I'm gonna crush... I'm not gonna crush Sister Freed yet.
[188:38.87]I'm gonna crush the Demon Prince sword.
[188:41.01]It's over.
[188:41.91]It's over, guys.
[188:42.63]It's gone.
[188:43.75]It's gone.
[188:47.11]Gone.
[188:49.99]And we're gonna crush this one, too.
[188:53.66]Gone.
[188:59.94]And that leaves us with... I need another, like, 7,000.
[189:06.66]Okay, well, let's just sell some shit.
[189:14.04]Did it!
[189:19.05]I didn't want to walk over and sell anything.
[189:21.23]I was too lazy to walk.
[189:22.83]It's over.
[189:32.04]It's over.
[189:44.47]Fucking rip.
[189:45.51]Fucking rip.
[189:56.09]Let's just see what's over here.
[189:57.07]I'm going to be streaming this tomorrow.
[190:06.65]So you will see this tomorrow.
[190:08.59]We'll continue.
[190:10.41]So I'm going to just get to a place where I think I know.
[190:14.45]Let's get to the next area and get a bonfire or something.
[190:20.75]I'm gonna go into the Spider Kingdom.
[190:22.29]There's still a bunch of stuff I didn't explore out there.
[190:26.81]I never crush any souls because I'm a completionist moron who likes to carry useless weapons around.
[190:31.13]But if that's the way you play the game, that's nice.
[190:35.85]I just get overwhelmed in Dark Souls.
[190:37.35]And I've played through Dark Souls 3 and Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne like so many times.
[190:42.57]And shit still overwhelms me.
[190:45.15]I pick up so much stuff, and let's be fair, there's a lot of useless fucking shit in this game that doesn't even need to exist.
[190:52.32]And it just does, and it overwhelms you.
[191:04.81]There are like seven daggers in this game, and none of them are worth using.
[191:12.42]It's like they made an entire weapon category that's not even worth equipping.
[191:17.90]What is there, like one dagger in the whole game that's actually worth putting on?
[191:21.32]And even if you put it on, it's not even as good as doing anything else.
[191:29.52]Nice reused cutscene.
[191:30.68]Yeah.
[191:43.58]The new dagger is good?
[191:44.58]Well, that's good to know.
[191:48.04]Daggers are good for bleed.
[191:50.94]Bleed is, like, only... It only works in certain occasions, though.
[191:54.50]Aren't there a lot of bosses in this game that are, like, immune to bleed?
[191:57.19]They don't bleed at all?
[192:01.01]I like Bloodborne's system having less but more unique weapons.
[192:03.25]I agree.
[192:05.31]Everybody complained about Bloodborne's weapons.
[192:07.60]There's only like 30... There's like 25 weapons in Bloodborne.
[192:11.24]That sucks.
[192:12.76]It's like, no, but when every single weapon in the game is completely unique from the next one, I think it's more fun.
[192:19.15]Now, were there like... This is really, really pretty.
[192:23.87]Were there cookie cutter builds in Bloodborne?
[192:26.91]Of course they were.
[192:28.70]But the weapons were all so different that you could play through with every weapon and actually have a good time.
[192:34.45]Maybe with the occasion... There was like one... Hold on.
[192:38.01]Oh, no.
[192:38.15]I serve the gods or just pretending?
[192:55.53]I'm just pretending.
[192:56.27]Yes.
[192:57.47]Yes, of course.
[192:59.15]How must one such as thee do service to the gods?
[193:02.87]I have intimate knowledge of thy kind.
[193:06.84]Did I fully complete Bloodborne?
[193:08.16]I know what I want.
[193:09.86]The Dark Soul.
[193:11.40]Why else would one day to visit this dunghill?
[193:14.19]Why else would one design this dunghill?
[193:15.63]I would be an ally to
[193:22.87]Screw the gods, do it for daddy.
[193:24.59]The Dark Soul, he said it.
[193:26.90]He said the name.
[193:29.44]He said the name of the movie.
[193:47.31]Alright, so this guy's my friend now.
[193:48.87]I was just gonna spam R1 and kill this guy.
[194:15.91]Alright.
[194:17.55]What do you guys think?
[194:18.61]Is this a good stopping point?
[194:19.47]Or should I just go for a little bit longer?
[194:21.51]Let's just go for a little longer.
[194:22.64]I just want to see what's over here.
[194:25.80]In the meadow.
[194:28.32]In the beautiful meadow.
[194:30.22]Where the singing woman stands.
[194:35.51]And the...
[194:46.01]Huh?
[194:51.95]Okay.
[194:56.29]I gotta sing that song again though.
[195:02.06]In the meadow where the singing woman stands I walk alone
[195:12.88]What am I supposed to do here?
[195:15.80]That was such a good opportunity to end the stream
[195:44.49]What?
[195:45.03]I got poised.
[195:50.49]So I'm assuming I have to hide.
[195:53.47]Worst green takeover ever.
[195:55.81]Watch, this is where you hide.
[195:57.45]Yeah, they shoot twice.
[195:59.87]And they disappear.
[196:00.83]I figured you out already.
[196:01.97]Everyone said this is the worst area in the game.
[196:03.69]Nope.
[196:03.85]You just gotta stand in the right spot, like right here.
[196:16.49]Why am I singing it like that?
[196:20.57]Well, he doesn't sound like that.
[196:25.87]He does not sound like that at all.
[196:37.05]Where do I go?
[196:43.95]Sounds like Billy Joel.
[196:46.69]Oh, God.
[196:50.62]Try a ranged battle or circling the road.
[196:53.06]Ah!
[196:54.72]Get out of here.
[197:07.85]You know I'm done with the game when I start singing.
[197:11.19]What the fuck?
[197:17.90]Am I gonna have to, like, shoot her or something?
[197:19.61]Is somebody sitting on her lap?
[197:20.59]Is that, like, no.
[197:24.13]I wish you would just get over her.
[197:28.87]That was very, that was way too cocky.
[197:43.16]Oh, what the fuck?
[197:45.28]Green Day featuring Mr. Sneak Man.
[197:49.06]I walk a lonely road, only one that I have ever known.
[197:55.61]Sweepin', sweepin' swamp.
[197:59.59]Shroom-dee-shrim-dee-shrim, then I walk alone.
[198:03.14]Boop-boop-boop, boop-boop.
[198:07.86]My shadow's on me.
[198:18.79]I've died here so many times.
[198:20.65]I need to get the bow out.
[198:30.64]Muted.
[198:32.42]It's not going to get muted.
[198:34.86]It's a copyright song.
[198:35.84]Can I hurt these guys?
[198:36.92]Nope.
[198:40.80]There's one specific place.
[198:44.10]It's this one over here.
[198:45.18]I'm going to hide right here.
[198:50.41]The boat doesn't do anything, okay.
[198:51.33]Well, good to know.
[198:52.05]So that means I have to just get over there.
[199:02.66]Um, I guess this is the only safe spot, and there's two of these assholes.
[199:09.48]First time I've ever seen a guy like you die here.
[199:25.07]Two... Three... Four... There's my opportunity.
[199:31.21]It's after one... Two... Three... Bye.
[199:37.00]That guy put his hands up like... That guy was just on a rollercoaster.
[199:46.36]That was all part of his plan.
[199:47.48]He had a parachute, guys.
[199:48.92]Don't worry about that guy.
[199:49.87]That dude had a fucking parachute.
[199:53.93]Okay.
[199:55.71]One, two, three, four.
[200:02.09]I'm glad you just ran like that, buddy.
[200:11.34]Holy shit!
[200:13.40]Come on!
[200:13.96]Come on!
[200:14.72]Get the fire out of here!
[200:15.64]What the fuck?
[200:18.12]What the fuck?
[200:18.92]Get the fire out of here!
[200:21.91]I'm being rootin' tootin'!
[200:27.52]I don't even know what that means.
[200:30.34]I'm saying, like, jokey words right now because this is, like, fucking stupid.
[200:36.60]I guess you just have to do that.
[200:37.61]You gotta just dodge them all.
[200:43.15]This DLC and, like, the jokey shit that they put in.
[200:48.81]These, like, weird, jokey, trap, like, enemy things.
[200:51.65]Like, I just wanna fucking play.
[200:54.41]Stop throwing the jokey shit at me.
[201:02.42]See if he does it again.
[201:05.28]This is what happens when you just make jokes.
[201:08.43]That wasn't even a joke.
[201:12.61]I was just saying, hey, whoa, no, whoa, hey, no.
[201:21.75]What is up with this shit?
[201:23.11]I don't want this fucking dumb jokey shit.
[201:25.42]Really.
[201:41.91]You're the one singing Green Day?
[201:46.07]I don't remember anything in a Souls game.
[201:51.16]Where you had to deal with this jokey shit.
[201:52.86]Come on.
[202:07.56]Let's see if I can, like, do anything else.
[202:09.26]I'm doing this wrong.
[202:15.88]Anything?
[202:16.24]Anything?
[202:16.60]Ooh!
[202:16.92]Yeah, get joked on, buddy.
[202:27.93]I couldn't dodge because there was no way for me to dodge.
[202:31.79]Well, at least I know where I'm going.
[202:40.14]I swear to fucking god.
[202:52.98]Get fucking joked on, yeah.
[202:55.04]And now I'm just trying to rush and it's gonna get me killed.
[202:59.52]I rushed, I rushed it.
[203:00.56]I'm dead.
[203:03.18]That was lucky.
[203:09.33]That guy just saved my life.
[203:14.69]Get the fuck... That guy saved my life.
[203:17.99]That guy pushed me the quarter of an inch that I needed.
[203:20.94]Otherwise, I was gonna die.
[203:22.98]Thank that guy.
[203:29.10]Joked on.
[203:31.62]Give me the cookie bug.
[203:37.68]Cookie bug.
[203:39.82]Cookie bug.
[203:43.30]A lot of those.
[203:49.35]Up the ladder.
[203:49.89]Hopefully... Can I drop?
[203:51.47]No.
[203:57.91]Alright, well... Is this just where she is?
[204:05.64]She's just sitting right here, right?
[204:08.86]This is just like Father Time.
[204:11.86]Don't, please.
[204:13.84]Not when I got all the way to Father Time.
[204:16.26]Don't stand here either.
[204:18.08]Father Time just fucking swung backwards, like I was a little kid in the backseat being, like, mean, and Mom, like, swung at me with her fucking ring finger.
[204:24.98]Come on!
[204:27.72]Who's this guy?
[204:35.17]What the fuck?
[204:36.83]What the fuck?
[204:51.77]I Think I might be I think it might be drained I Think I'm mentally drained after the demon prince.
[204:57.09]I think my brain seriously just somebody needs to come down here Just grab me by the head and shake it just shake oh
[205:05.97]Shake until you make my eggs fucking scrambled eggs.
[205:09.19]I just said eggs.
[205:10.73]Shake until you make my eggs scrambled brain.
[205:20.02]No, don't.
[205:22.22]He didn't hit me this time.
[205:23.12]Wow.
[205:25.40]Wow.
[205:27.80]Time to go fight father time.
[205:30.51]Sitting in his chair.
[205:34.66]Why do I smell pee, by the way?
[205:37.56]This is something that I don't know.
[205:39.66]Did I pee my pants?
[205:43.28]Why do I smell pee?
[205:44.70]I shouldn't be smelling pee right now.
[205:50.10]Nothing about that makes any sense.
[206:03.87]There's nothing fucking safe.
[206:08.33]Alright, I'm gonna top off.
[206:18.30]Oh my, oh my god, FromSoftware.
[206:24.04]I just like... Mmm.
[206:33.07]I like got greedy but I didn't even know I was getting greedy because the archers didn't fucking spawn.
[206:41.67]The fucking archers didn't spawn.
[206:43.75]This random ghost was swinging around a giant turkey leg.
[206:47.55]It's like three times in a row.
[207:06.72]I think I'm pretty gone right now.
[207:11.67]I think I'm gone.
[207:12.83]How is that not in the right spot?
[207:17.37]That was in the right spot was it not?
[207:20.27]Am I crazy?
[207:30.46]This place sucks.
[207:32.36]This whole DLC has just been, like, a bunch of just shitty areas.
[207:39.51]These areas... Dude, speedrunning these areas?
[207:43.73]Good fucking luck, all you speedrunners doing DLC runs.
[207:46.95]Because this is going to suck total asshole.
[207:54.21]I can imagine people losing, like, three minutes on their splits doing this.
[208:13.68]I overshot it.
[208:16.84]It was right there.
[208:17.44]It was in the wrong spot.
[208:20.28]Seriously?
[208:34.77]Oh, come on.
[208:39.53]I just got calmed down, man.
[208:42.15]You're waiting for the stream rage quit?
[208:43.91]I'm not even mad right now.
[208:46.23]I'm just like... I'm just so mentally drained.
[208:48.95]This game just drains the fuck out of me.
[208:51.87]But it's so much fun.
[208:58.61]I just have to have stamina for when they come up to dodge the arrows.
[209:09.83]There they are.
[209:13.22]Here comes this dumb guy.
[209:15.00]There he is.
[209:19.59]I was seriously just trying to get out of the way there.
[209:21.47]That's all I wanted.
[209:23.71]Archers?
[209:24.13]No.
[209:24.49]Where are they?
[209:28.83]Right there.
[209:37.74]I love how he just scraped the ground.
[209:45.70]Just kill him.
[209:46.42]Kill him.
[209:47.14]I don't even care.
[209:47.70]Kill him.
[209:49.10]That's it, right?
[209:49.54]They can't come out anymore?
[209:54.46]Dude, FromSoftware, you missed a really great Humpty Dumpty opportunity here.
[209:58.77]If he just rolled backwards and his feet came in the air.
[210:03.13]Kind of unfortunate.
[210:06.01]Okay, he's not that bad.
[210:14.71]Time for fear.
[210:16.79]Many of us are by the fire, forsaken.
[210:20.53]I speak of thine kind and mine.
[210:23.41]Behold the city.
[210:25.65]We are kindred, but like two eyes which gaze upon the other.
[210:31.21]Fear not the dark.
[210:32.25]Oh shit, a spider!
[210:32.71]Ah, there.
[210:36.40]There, I know you now.
[210:42.65]Don't worry, I got the bomb!
[210:44.00]I got the bomb, guys!
[210:44.82]Don't worry!
[210:45.28]He doesn't drop anything?
[211:07.43]Yeah.
[211:09.70]Did he have anything to say that was, like, worth talking about?
[211:11.89]I hope not.
[211:15.61]Now you can't get the best weapon.
[211:19.81]That guy just comes out and pushes you.
[211:37.28]He jumps around the corner and just shoves you.
[211:47.96]Oh, come on.
[211:49.24]Alright, he's gonna be back, right?
[211:50.45]The spider's gonna be back?
[212:04.61]I got Humpty Dumpty.
[212:07.61]Alright, so now that that happened, spoiler alert, what, what, what, did I do anything?
[212:13.39]What was the item he was gonna give me?
[212:15.56]I hope he comes back.
[212:16.24]I don't think I even need to kill this guy.
[212:27.78]What happens if I just leap along?
[212:33.03]That guy's not gonna lie there, I forgot the archers exist.
[212:36.78]I forgot.
[212:42.55]I just didn't.
[212:43.19]I forgot.
[212:44.59]Now we have to be aware of them.
[212:47.03]Here they come.
[212:54.86]Those fucking tree enemies came over here.
[212:57.60]And the guy's showing me his new karate moves.
[213:07.63]how did these guys even get up here like why are these guys up here why are these guys up here oh
[213:34.66]Why were they up there?
[213:35.84]They weren't up there before.
[213:36.76]I didn't even kill them before.
[213:37.94]I didn't even fucking kill those guys last time and both of them fucking came to me.
[213:44.12]Wait, what?
[213:53.71]It's just like, these games, they're not even video games.
[213:57.54]You know what fucking these Dark Souls, the DLC is especially?
[214:01.82]They're just patience testers.
[214:04.13]And, like, how well do you score on the patience test?
[214:08.91]This is not even a fucking video game.
[214:12.41]This is the equivalent of somebody poking you in the side of the head with their ring finger.
[214:16.68]Or their index finger.
[214:18.18]Until you tell them to stop.
[214:21.10]Like, how long can you have a guy just poke you in the head with a finger?
[214:24.78]Over and over again.
[214:25.96]Initially, you're gonna be like... Nah, this is fine.
[214:28.62]I can handle this.
[214:29.68]Like, after two hours of somebody poking you in the side of the head with their finger...
[214:34.16]You're going to get kind of annoyed.
[214:35.06]You're going to be like, fucking stop poking me with your finger.
[214:38.64]I'm done with this.
[214:41.00]What is with all these ring finger references?
[214:42.64]I don't know.
[214:45.09]We're really about the ring finger.
[214:47.71]And this guy can just go fuck himself.
[214:49.83]But not yet.
[214:51.71]Now he can.
[214:54.87]Alright, here we go.
[215:01.14]I didn't... He's back, he's back, he's back.
[215:04.55]He's back.
[215:04.89]He's just continuing his dialog.
[215:05.68]I love it.
[215:06.96]Why is this guy back?
[215:23.34]I am actually kind of surprised that this guy is here.
[215:27.12]I mean, there's no reason to kill him now.
[215:31.30]But his little brother comes out and does like a funny kid shove.
[215:53.17]Yeah, nice try.
[215:54.93]That's all this guy does, is push.
[215:56.05]And he tries to hit you with his crucifix.
[215:58.15]Or his, like, cross.
[215:59.46]What the hell he has?
[216:02.56]Is he holding, like, a crucifix?
[216:05.12]Oh, no.
[216:05.42]It's just, like, a stick.
[216:06.12]I thought that was, like, a fucking... That cross, or, like, a... Whatever the hell it was.
[216:09.56]This guy behind me.
[216:31.99]Didn't I have 8,000 souls?
[216:37.04]It's just a big ring finger.
[216:41.20]Watch out.
[216:41.84]Somebody... I know.
[216:42.72]I know these games.
[216:43.50]I understand how this game works.
[216:44.56]I'm gonna go get this item and a guy's gonna come push me.
[216:48.78]So I'm just gonna turn around now.
[216:49.77]We're gonna preemptively wait for the guy to run down the stairs and push me.
[216:52.81]I've told you.
[216:53.23]What did I fucking tell you?
[216:54.41]Get the fuck out of here.
[216:57.09]Guy climbing up the side of the building.
[216:59.89]No thanks.
[217:00.95]I ain't gonna let that happen.
[217:11.67]Get out of here.
[217:13.17]What the hell was that?
[217:14.05]How many of you are there?
[217:16.79]There was three of you?
[217:17.57]Come on.
[217:19.81]You can do better than that from.
[217:23.69]And there's a bonfire.
[217:24.35]Hello.
[217:29.96]Okay.
[217:31.02]I think... I'm going to go in the next one room.
[217:35.30]Just to see.
[217:37.20]And I think this is what we're going to call it.
[217:38.36]Because I do want to have... I want to stream this tomorrow.
[217:41.66]And we'll see how much... See how far we get through tomorrow.
[217:45.01]We have the second bonfire here.
[217:46.51]I'm just going to run down here and see what... I'm just going to see what's down here.
[217:53.77]Follow this guy.
[217:58.70]Who knows?
[217:59.34]What's down here?
[217:59.80]Alright.
[218:01.86]Everybody take a look at the surroundings and do a mental image and get the whole thing mapped out.
[218:05.80]So tomorrow we can just go right to the boss.
[218:08.16]Okay.
[218:08.64]Statue of the guy with the wheel.
[218:09.90]Sword guy.
[218:10.52]Got it.
[218:11.46]What's down here?
[218:13.28]Okay.
[218:13.84]Something else?
[218:17.27]Turtle.
[218:18.17]Turtle person that shoots laser beams out of their face.
[218:19.89]Got it.
[218:21.05]What's down here?
[218:21.61]Church?
[218:26.33]Church.
[218:26.59]Alright.
[218:27.09]That's it.
[218:30.11]That's it.
[218:32.40]Just going to see what's down here.
[218:36.18]Hopefully you guys took at least 10 screenshots.
[218:42.61]We know what's over there.
[218:43.27]What about over here?
[218:50.48]I'm actually meeting you here.
[218:52.70]A true blessing that we should seek the same place and find ourselves standing here together.
[218:59.21]I've got the last of my brew.
[219:02.79]To my search and to your duty.
[219:06.81]And to the joy that lies before us.
[219:10.90]Alright then.
[219:13.16]Bottoms up.
[219:16.42]Now, I'm off once I find it.
[219:20.20]Everything will come back to me, who I was.
[219:23.58]And what terrible grudges I held.
[219:26.57]I don't know.
[219:27.89]I just have this feeling that that's the kind of man I was.
[219:31.35]Oh, don't hold it against me.
[219:34.03]I only think I was.
[219:36.89]This is just Patches with his memory wiped.
[219:41.10]Come on.
[219:43.04]Really?
[219:43.28]I know you're going to take that helmet off and you're going to do something.
[219:45.34]You're going to swindle me and it's going to be so funny.
[219:48.26]Huh.
[219:48.72]I guess I was Patches.
[219:50.34]Huh.
[219:50.94]Interesting.
[219:51.42]Alright.
[219:52.94]That's going to be it.
[219:55.98]Uh.
[219:56.20]I'm glad at least I got one boss down.
[219:57.98]And I believe there are three bosses or four in this DLC.
[220:00.38]So.
[220:02.14]Uh.
[220:02.28]Thank you so much everybody for watching.
[220:04.51]Now the salt levels were at an extreme level tonight.
[220:06.85]But we got through it and we beat that first boss.
[220:09.27]Good.
[220:10.91]Uh.
[220:13.67]Pretty good.
[220:14.53]Pretty, pretty, pretty good.
[220:17.51]I like it.
[220:18.21]We'll see.
[220:18.55]If the next boss is a co-op two-person boss with three phases, I'm going to be not happy again.
[220:27.21]But, whatever.
[220:29.13]Thank you, everybody.
[220:31.16]Also, thank you to Sly161 for the $5.
[220:32.90]Good job on that, Boster.
[220:35.02]My sub to you during your first playthrough of Dark Souls 3.
[220:37.24]And a lot has happened over the past year, including getting diagnosed with Crohn's.
[220:40.50]Really.
[220:41.98]I was looking forward to the streams there.
[220:43.14]Great.
[220:43.88]Well, as somebody else with colon issues, I will say hopefully you get it figured out.
[220:52.54]Hopefully you get evaluated correctly.
[220:55.08]The problem with, like, IBD is...
[220:59.21]It's like hard to manage sometimes, so I wish you the best of luck, dude.
[221:05.62]30 phase boss.
[221:06.92]Yeah, but that's going to be it.
[221:08.02]I'll see you guys tomorrow, same time.
[221:10.48]We're going to do tomorrow, we'll do more Dark Souls 3.
[221:13.36]I want to try to get another boss down.
[221:15.91]And then, on Friday, I'm going to be streaming early on Friday.
[221:22.53]So instead of 7 o'clock, we're going to be going pretty early Eastern time.
[221:28.69]And I'll let you guys know exactly when, but... Um... Take care, guys.
[221:32.99]See you all later.
[221:33.93]Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[221:36.05]If you did... If you enjoyed that stream... Let me... Let me get that follow.
[221:40.35]You know what I mean?
[221:41.09]If you've never been... You know... Let me get that follow.
[221:43.33]When was the last time I've said that?
[221:45.64]Have I ever said that?
[221:47.38]I don't think I've ever said that in, like, the fucking year and a half I've been streaming.
[221:50.34]Isn't that what you're supposed to say?
[221:55.18]At the end of a stream?
[221:56.84]You know, guys, let me hit... Scratch up that follow button.
[222:02.38]Isn't that what people say?
[222:05.77]Yes, it is.
[222:07.93]But, goodnight, guys.
[222:08.87]See you later.
[222:10.93]Much love.
[222:13.75]Sellout.
[222:14.87]I don't like... If you don't want to follow, then I don't... But, goodnight, guys.
[222:21.04]I'll see you tomorrow.
[222:22.12]Take care, everybody.
[222:23.42]Have a good one.
[222:27.34]Someone was asking why the stream was in sub only mode.
[222:29.28]It's because of spoilers.
[222:32.44]I only want to know what to do if it's something that I ask for.
[222:37.52]I don't want to look over at the chat and be like, oh, hey, by the way, if you do this, this, this, and that, I don't know why you're not doing that.
[222:43.46]It's go there.
[222:44.82]I like to at least try for a little while until I get frustrated enough where I need to ask for help.
[222:50.12]And with games like these, as you know, Dark Souls is all about, like, needing to explore things on your own, I guess.
[222:58.11]But it's funny that I say that because it turns out that, like, all the major things you need to find out, like you guys just told me anyway.
[223:04.81]But, yeah.
[223:06.09]Take it easy.
[223:06.97]Good night.
[223:07.63]See you tomorrow.
