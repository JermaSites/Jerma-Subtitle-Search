[00:05.05]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06.65]Welcome to episode 7 of Grandpa, the best player in the world for Major League Gaming Nintendo.
[00:14.52]And fucking look at what I'm playing.
[00:16.18]I'm back on Modern Warfare 3.
[00:18.44]It's a great day.
[00:20.22]So if you're wondering...
[00:21.45]How the fuck did I get back on Modern Warfare 3?
[00:24.61]Well, I'll tell you.
[00:25.67]I bought 16 copies of the game on Steam.
[00:28.96]So that means if I get banned again, I can just go right into my Steam account there and just activate one of the copies I have.
[00:35.92]It's a fucking genius plan.
[00:44.61]So in this episode, we're gonna talk about balance, and what guns are too overpowered, what guns are underpowered, and everything in between.
[00:53.72]So what you're looking at right here is you're looking at... I can't really speak fucking Japanese, so bear with me for a second.
[01:00.33]The Akimabo's default... I fucking call them the stupid beetle snake guns, because that's what they look like.
[01:08.34]But these guns can kill you in less than one second.
[01:11.56]Which, that's pretty fucked up right there.
[01:13.96]So this goes on the list of overpowered dickhead gun one.
[01:19.53]There's two of these.
[01:21.50]Next up, I'm gonna talk about the Type 95.
[01:24.24]And before I say a goddamn word, can we just talk about this for one second?
[01:29.02]Look at these two.
[01:30.26]The Type 95 and beetle guns, they both look like alien space beetle fucking alien guns.
[01:36.63]And I don't think for a second that this is a coincidence.
[01:39.53]These are the two most overpowered guns in the game, and they both fucking look the same.
[01:43.91]This is a conspiracy, and you know what?
[01:46.65]Fuck this.
[01:47.55]I'm making a phone call right now.
[01:50.53]Yes, hello, this is MLG Grandpa.
[01:54.21]I'm calling to just try and get in touch with somebody over there.
[01:57.85]Because we are not being fooled by your alien space bug propaganda that you are shoving down our throats.
[02:07.94]And we will stand together to fight the alien bug human war of 2096.
[02:13.98]And that's pretty much all I have to say.
[02:19.82]Answer the phone next time.
[02:22.08]Suck this, you fucking prick!
[02:24.38]Ooh, what do we got in here?
[02:26.10]Oh my god, it's an Overwatch.
[02:28.22]Oh shit!
[02:29.64]Stupid fucking fake care packages.
[02:31.40]We won't talk about overpowered.
[02:32.89]This is the most fucking overpowered thing in the game, and I will stand by that.
[02:38.45]Okay, so we've talked about overpowered stuff.
[02:41.47]Now let's talk about underpowered stuff.
[02:44.43]And, um... I don't even know what's underpowered.
[02:48.57]You know, I made this list up of all the things that are right here overpowered in the game.
[02:52.63]I'm looking at it with my glasses on.
[02:54.61]I don't see anything about anything underpowered.
[02:57.70]So I'm just going to make this up because I don't want to look like a dickhead.
[03:01.58]You know, I don't have to explain my reasoning for this.
[03:04.93]I can tell you that the clown gun is the most overpowered, underpowered fucking gun.
[03:09.37]and it doesn't even exist in the fucking game!
[03:11.73]So you know what?
[03:13.43]The AK-47, the clown gun, and the sunflower seed chocolate Big Bird the fuckface, those are the three most underpowered guns in the game.
[03:22.60]Sorry I didn't do my research.
[03:25.02]Fuck!
[03:26.38]Hey, it's me again, Activision.
[03:28.40]I'm just calling to let you know about this list of patch notes I have here, and what you should do to change the game for the better.
[03:35.60]Okay, so, uh, number one,
[03:37.75]remove the beetle space alien guns because we know what you're doing and number two you want to get rid of all spines have people spawn in the same spot just right on top of each other over and over again uh get rid of the get rid of the music in the game it's stupid get rid of dedicated servers oh wait a second I forgot those don't exist uh get rid of the cheese get rid of the
