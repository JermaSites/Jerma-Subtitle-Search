[00:47.19]Hey, everybody.
[00:48.95]Hi.
[00:51.29]Sorry, I'm a little bit late.
[00:53.73]That's what happens.
[00:54.88]That's what happens when you have a live stream and you got all kinds of technical problems.
[01:01.30]Pretty much every stream.
[01:02.30]Hi, guys.
[01:04.10]Hold on, everybody, hold on.
[01:07.87]Technical problems, the stream.
[01:09.47]Give me one second.
[01:44.73]So I do have a little bit of bad news for all of you that were anticipating that there'd be somebody here.
[01:52.48]Where's Italics soundboard?
[01:53.62]Well, unfortunately... Well, I guess give me one second here.
[02:00.02]Unfortunately, Italics is not here.
[02:03.16]He did not make it.
[02:05.96]His plane got delayed, and he won't be here until Sunday afternoon.
[02:12.17]So, uh, that's not going to happen.
[02:15.70]Instead, what's going to happen is we're going to play chess.
[02:17.50]We're going to play chess tonight.
[02:20.24]It's going to be real fucking boring.
[02:21.50]You're going to hate this stream.
[02:24.88]How does that sound to you?
[02:26.78]Good.
[02:27.86]Sounds pretty good.
[02:28.96]Good.
[02:30.29]Does that sound bad to you?
[02:31.89]No.
[02:36.33]Hey!
[02:37.41]Hey, wait a minute.
[02:38.61]Hey, who's that?
[02:41.11]Is that a person or is that a soundboard?
[02:45.29]Yes.
[02:46.49]He was never here to begin with, guys.
[02:51.32]You want me to show you my soundboard?
[02:53.34]I got it on my phone.
[02:54.72]Here, you want to see it?
[02:56.88]I'll give you a good look at it.
[03:00.39]Here's my soundboard.
[03:04.23]Or is it a soundboard after all?
[03:06.69]There he is.
[03:08.58]Me the whole time.
[03:09.88]I was here the whole time.
[03:10.90]Smokewise Ganja.
[03:11.54]He's been here the whole time.
[03:12.74]You think this is a lie?
[03:13.90]Yeah, you think he was kidding?
[03:15.27]You think he was kidding around?
[03:17.13]Yeah.
[03:18.11]You know it.
[03:18.63]Face cam.
[03:19.13]Well, the face cam is only going to be on for like a few minutes just so we can see just like how we look here.
[03:23.89]You like the beard?
[03:26.33]Yeah, people like the beard.
[03:28.17]You should.
[03:28.77]I picked him up.
[03:30.53]I told you I was going to get him.
[03:31.59]He was like three hours late.
[03:33.13]Yeah, he was three hours late.
[03:34.40]They brought me out of cot in the airport.
[03:36.40]A little problem here.
[03:37.20]Hold on.
[03:37.54]Sorry about that.
[03:39.64]Gonna have to, like, move this down a little bit just to make sure you get you in there too, you know what I mean?
[03:45.62]So, uh, anyways, we're gonna be playing some local, uh, local co-op tonight.
[03:51.67]We're gonna be playing some local co-op tonight.
[03:54.37]Not a big deal.
[04:00.63]And that's the joke, ladies and gentlemen!
[04:02.25]Hey, let's go, hey, yoinky!
[04:04.07]We're down now at normal size.
[04:07.03]I wanna be, I like that up there.
[04:09.59]I like being up here.
[04:10.25]I like being like- This is very degrading.
[04:14.05]No!
[04:14.21]You know what?
[04:14.86]Fuck this!
[04:16.20]No!
[04:16.72]We can do this for real!
[04:18.32]How tall are you?
[04:19.42]For real.
[04:19.70]Like, no, don't joke.
[04:20.60]How tall are you?
[04:22.70]5'11".
[04:22.96]5'11".
[04:23.12]He's 5'11".
[04:24.38]5'11".
[04:24.84]Are you ready for this shit?
[04:26.64]We're going full screen for this one.
[04:28.12]Oh, don't break anything.
[04:30.13]You think this is a fucking joke?
[04:32.47]Check this shit out.
[04:33.73]Stand up.
[04:34.71]I want a full body.
[04:37.77]Stand back here.
[04:38.91]So people can see you.
[04:42.39]He's 5'11", understand?
[04:44.65]He's 5'11".
[04:48.54]Excuse me!
[04:50.32]He's 5'11"!
[04:51.68]Can we put an end to this joke once and for all?
[04:53.36]Back to back, back to back.
[04:56.98]Can we stop this joke?
[04:59.56]Once and for all, can we stop this?
[05:02.64]My fly is down.
[05:03.69]No, it's not.
[05:04.13]We're good.
[05:06.91]He's 5'11".
[05:12.83]That's the only reason why he's here, is so I could prove how tall I am.
[05:16.35]That was a very expensive anti-joke.
[05:20.09]That was a very expensive joke to get him here to prove to you guys that I'm not fucking 5'2".
[05:24.02]God damn it.
[05:27.26]Yeah, now I'm short.
[05:33.18]You look like 5'5".
[05:34.08]Yeah, so now it's not that you're tall, it's that I'm short, actually.
[05:40.99]That's the direction that went.
[05:42.54]It went the wrong way.
[05:43.80]It went the wrong way.
[05:44.96]But it doesn't matter.
[05:45.56]Look, look.
[05:47.84]People are saying point at the feet to make sure like I don't have any fucking jokey stuff on.
[05:51.32]Go on, show them.
[05:52.62]Show them.
[05:54.10]Show them.
[05:54.40]Point it down here.
[05:55.56]Point it down to my socks.
[05:57.14]I don't got any like stilts on, guys.
[05:58.52]This is a normal human boy.
[06:02.00]It's all about the truth.
[06:05.50]It's all about the truth.
[06:07.42]Now you're like, now you're a five foot four.
[06:10.54]Good.
[06:11.32]Good.
[06:12.32]I can handle it.
[06:15.32]I've been 5'4 on my life.
[06:17.10]I can't take it for another... Alright, can you guys hear the audio?
[06:20.72]We got a special thing on tap here today.
[06:23.49]Very special.
[06:26.65]Let's just get this going here because the game we're playing tonight, this is very important.
[06:31.07]The first game we're going to play in our local co-op, it's a game I've wanted to play for a long time.
[06:36.06]It's going to be...
[06:38.45]Hold on, just wait till it shows up on the- Family Guy!
[06:41.59]Back to the fucking multiverse!
[06:43.33]Often requested.
[06:45.67]What's that- how'd the song go?
[06:47.27]Oh, how does it go?
[06:49.52]I can't even hear- I can't hear it.
[06:55.80]This is- oh, we fucked up bad.
[06:57.48]I can't hear a thing.
[07:00.45]I got the wrong- I got the wrong plugin.
[07:04.92]Alright, what's your favorite episode from 1999?
[07:07.22]My favorite Family Guy episode is definitely the one with Stewie gets arrested.
[07:16.52]I have no idea what's going to happen right now.
[07:21.80]Not banned from Twitch.
[07:24.06]Oh, wait, hold on a second here.
[07:25.08]Oh.
[07:30.97]Hey, I got a joke for ya!
[07:33.09]Just a great segway.
[07:35.27]Oh wait, Matt, match it up, I'm Stewie.
[07:37.19]Wow, good memory though, I totally blanked on that.
[07:40.84]Stewie Griffin!
[07:42.42]Kim!
[07:42.58]Oh god, Bertrand!
[07:43.56]Kim, get down, there's somebody else on the screen!
[07:46.06]I killed you!
[07:46.76]I'm Brian, Brian doesn't- he's not saying anything.
[07:49.02]Hey, why don't we get him a drink?
[07:50.22]Oh, so you got yourself a multiverse remote, huh?
[07:52.52]Indeed I did!
[07:53.62]Wait, hold on.
[07:54.00]Don't open that!
[07:54.54]Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on here?
[07:56.96]Sorry, hang on one sec.
[07:58.60]You remember the multiverse theory?
[08:01.58]It's everywhere, man.
[08:02.00]It's everywhere.
[08:02.42]It's on the keyboard.
[08:02.94]Everyone wonders how this shit happens.
[08:20.82]I can't possibly allow a universe to exist without me in it!
[08:23.44]Alright, like, how do we skip this?
[08:41.92]Alright so I'm Stewie. How do you be Brian?
[08:45.92]Yeah that's what happens when you open a shooken up soda.
[08:50.31]So I think you can press start.
[08:53.35]Oh yeah, here we go.
[08:53.87]Split screen.
[08:54.57]Split screen, local co-op only.
[08:56.99]I hope you guys are ready for the worst fucking stream.
[09:00.35]Okay.
[09:00.77]Naked Peter, shoot him in the fucking head.
[09:04.05]I can't.
[09:04.49]Alright, let's go this way.
[09:06.05]Okay, I'm Brian.
[09:07.75]We got a cutscene.
[09:08.85]Right off the bat.
[09:09.71]They still dig your soundboard.
[09:10.87]By the way, this was $50.
[09:26.21]I had to buy it.
[09:27.41]They used to sell this on Steam.
[09:28.53]They don't sell it anymore.
[09:29.41]You have to go buy it third party.
[09:31.34]It's so loud.
[09:32.52]It's so loud.
[09:33.12]Let me turn this down.
[09:34.94]How do I turn it down?
[09:36.14]I spent $50 for what's going to amount to like eight minutes.
[09:37.92]This is going to teach us how to play, at least.
[09:46.69]Yeah, let's go through the tutorial mission of Family Guy, the cooperative experience.
[09:51.27]I think the game broke.
[09:54.47]All right.
[09:56.17]How do we play?
[09:56.78]The sound is still here.
[10:01.90]Yeah, the game actually is broken.
[10:03.44]The game is stuck.
[10:04.88]It's frozen.
[10:05.78]Yeah, this is not supposed to happen.
[10:08.55]But the balloon in the background is still glistening.
[10:10.99]The balloon in the background still works.
[10:12.81]Can you press start?
[10:15.46]No.
[10:15.82]Oh, god damn it.
[10:18.74]Are you serious?
[10:22.78]Why?
[10:25.31]Oh, my God.
[10:26.77]Okay, well.
[10:27.45]We're going to have to watch the intro.
[10:30.66]Oh, there it is.
[10:31.14]We're good.
[10:31.44]We're good.
[10:32.06]All right, so it's LT and his aim and RT.
[10:34.96]Who is just mumbling in the background?
[10:36.98]What's with all the flips?
[10:37.84]Do you see all this?
[10:39.40]I have 15 waypoints to go to.
[10:41.64]All right, wait, wait, wait.
[10:43.80]We're supposed to shoot balloons.
[10:46.02]So shoot the balloon behind him.
[10:47.04]There we go.
[10:51.26]How come you get a laser gun and I have, like, a Glock?
[10:53.36]Okay, hold select to select your weapon.
[11:00.57]I guess we can unlock stuff.
[11:02.19]X is reload.
[11:03.19]There is no select button.
[11:04.63]You're gonna be sick.
[11:05.90]What, you can't handle it?
[11:07.46]You can't handle the split-screen co-op?
[11:09.48]What's wrong?
[11:13.96]Guys, this was $50, so we have to play this for at least $20.
[11:17.53]This is why I'm here.
[11:18.99]Yeah, he's here for this game.
[11:23.23]I came all the way here to play Family Guy.
[11:26.56]We're going to skip every cutscene, by the way.
[11:28.48]I don't think you can.
[11:29.40]I don't know if you noticed, but I was mashing every level.
[11:31.64]Oh, were you?
[11:31.98]All right, here we go.
[11:34.35]Good.
[11:34.67]You shot all the balloons.
[11:35.79]No, you can't skip cutscenes.
[11:37.55]You can't skip a single cutscene.
[11:38.95]We're gonna watch an episode of Family Guy on screen.
[11:41.33]Dude, wait until my bros see these nasty pictures of you.
[11:44.33]Hey, get back here with those.
[11:45.92]I was gonna wait one more year before I leaked naked pictures of me online.
[11:49.22]Family Guy's always so funny.
[11:50.28]You should go talk to that sorority girl and see what's the matter.
[11:52.90]Also, ask her how much her dad has in his retirement fund.
[11:56.08]Oh.
[11:59.09]They're just mumbling incessantly in the background.
[12:02.41]Something I think you have to realize.
[12:03.79]It froze again.
[12:05.28]It froze again.
[12:07.14]After every cutscene, I have to alt tab the game, otherwise we stay like this.
[12:11.58]We have to come back from a ha ha ha so funny next.
[12:16.20]Come on, it's a local co-op game.
[12:22.77]No, we're good.
[12:23.32]No, we're good.
[12:23.80]We're gonna go over here.
[12:26.68]Yeah, I don't think you got... Are you guys aware of what the next game is?
[12:31.32]I don't think you are.
[12:34.17]You're hurting me.
[12:34.69]That actually is doing damage.
[12:35.81]How'd you do that?
[12:36.27]Where'd you get that?
[12:39.03]It was only a matter of time.
[12:46.03]I feel like I'm playing fucking like Roblox.
[12:49.12]How do you do melee?
[12:49.76]What's melee?
[12:50.10]I'm not telling you.
[12:51.28]It's my secret weapon.
[12:56.79]dying uh I am dying as well I don't know wait is this a bomb that's a trash bag by the way we did it okay I just pushed like completed this is why you picked me distraction tactic all right just talk to this lady already oh my god and we can't skip it pictures of me and my sorority jerking investors I'll pretend to like whoever gets them back
[13:24.48]You got to alt-tab again.
[13:26.34]God damn it.
[13:27.86]Every single cutscene.
[13:31.17]Let's go.
[13:32.01]Recover Elise's scandalous picture.
[13:33.93]40 meters this way.
[13:35.99]37.
[13:36.03]Why do you walk five feet into another cutscene?
[13:43.01]Turn on the face scan.
[13:44.31]You got it!
[13:45.07]No, that's too big.
[13:46.03]Get those guys!
[13:46.99]They're with the nerds!
[13:48.63]There we go.
[13:49.78]Now we're like on camera.
[13:50.88]Oh no.
[13:52.80]Just to prove.
[13:53.76]Just to prove that we're actually here.
[14:01.77]It loaded a cutscene to do this.
[14:06.35]Why is this game such a piece of crap?
[14:23.00]Okay, we can play a video game again.
[14:26.08]Watch out for the grenades.
[14:29.86]By the way, if you didn't know, I'm Stewie.
[14:31.94]He's Brian.
[14:32.92]Hold and release RB as Stewie to throw a poopy diaper.
[14:36.54]But don't hold on too long.
[14:41.64]You died?
[14:42.32]Okay, I'm dead.
[14:43.14]I died.
[14:43.96]You're standing in that.
[14:45.92]Why is a poopy diaper a grenade?
[14:47.88]It's a poison grenade.
[14:50.35]This is great.
[14:51.83]I'd bang that when I'm blacked out.
[14:53.63]You want the pictures?
[14:54.75]Come and get them.
[14:55.92]I already ate it to them anyway.
[14:57.82]These two dorks just won't quit.
[14:58.84]We're going to be able to shoot that.
[14:59.94]After we freeze the game.
[15:01.16]This is not going to last long.
[15:02.68]Shoot the explosive.
[15:04.42]Got it.
[15:14.30]What are they holding?
[15:15.06]I think that boy in the pool is his name.
[15:16.65]Uh, I believe that those are... All right, watch out.
[15:17.99]Booby Dipper up.
[15:18.65]You see, college is all about having fun.
[15:20.61]No, he's dead.
[15:21.83]No one's helping him.
[15:22.67]Oh, okay.
[15:23.70]What's that?
[15:23.98]Was it syringes?
[15:25.30]Health packages?
[15:27.71]Looks like I got a fresh Jack Daniels.
[15:29.91]Piss off.
[15:31.51]Piss off.
[15:32.63]Hey, piss off.
[15:33.60]This game is... This game is infirmature.
[15:35.34]This game is real bad, by the way.
[15:37.34]Read it, M. This is the game that I've wanted to so badly play on local co-op.
[15:42.12]All right, let's collect the photo.
[15:43.28]Let's bring it back.
[15:45.04]He's actually been begging to play this for about... Three years.
[15:48.66]Three years.
[15:50.23]The only reason we haven't played it up until now is because it's local only co-op.
[15:54.53]Yeah.
[15:54.85]The way it was meant to be played.
[15:57.13]Classic family guy humor.
[15:59.87]Well, I mean, where are we going?
[16:00.95]We gotta go talk to Mort.
[16:08.63]Just like... Fuck him.
[16:11.83]Do you have a grenade or no?
[16:13.51]No, no, you get the weapons.
[16:15.21]I get a glass bottle.
[16:16.53]Do we have like a Simpsons move where you can throw me over the hedge or something?
[16:19.97]No, you're stuck on this side.
[16:21.13]Sorry, we have to walk all the way back around the other way.
[16:24.36]No, shit, whoops.
[16:26.76]Where is it?
[16:27.22]How do we get back there?
[16:28.26]You have to walk all the way around.
[16:29.58]Is it more over here?
[16:30.32]Which house is ours?
[16:34.66]I'm so wasted.
[16:35.30]I don't even know where you are.
[16:37.48]You walked all the way around the house, didn't you?
[16:40.42]Yeah.
[16:40.64]I'm thinking if I get there first, I can at least trigger this cutscene for us.
[16:43.74]Yeah, please trigger the cutscene for us.
[16:44.98]You're just teleported over here.
[16:46.32]Because I have no idea where the hell I am.
[16:47.64]I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[16:49.46]And this game is very loud, but you know, sometimes... It is very loud, yes.
[16:53.74]You should try to find more of them so you have material to shamelessly touch yourself to at night, or even very early in the morning.
[16:59.69]Can't beat Family Guy.
[17:01.05]What do you mean can't beat Family Guy?
[17:04.29]Who wants to play Family Guy?
[17:06.55]Let alone can't, oh, can't beat it.
[17:10.11]We gotta beat Family Guy on stream in less than four hours.
[17:13.32]How long is this game gonna be?
[17:18.22]This game can't be more than five hours.
[17:21.50]for a timer on the screen.
[17:23.76]Oh, fucking God.
[17:24.82]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[17:29.45]Girls shooting hairspray as their weapon?
[17:32.09]Plus two.
[17:34.55]Is it mace or hair, what is it?
[17:35.89]What are they like, is it hairspray?
[17:38.10]Actually, it might be mace.
[17:41.48]That guy's holding a brick.
[17:43.96]I like to think it's hairspray.
[17:46.43]Screw off.
[17:47.91]I really don't understand, like... Like, who paid to develop this game?
[17:52.87]Licensed games are licensed games.
[17:54.37]That's fine.
[17:54.85]But, uh... Like, for 50 bucks, you're just paying for the license at that point.
[17:57.37]This is a douchebag.
[17:59.19]This didn't work.
[18:15.44]I'm getting close, dude.
[18:16.54]I'm getting close to doing a skip here to the next game.
[18:21.24]I'm getting real close.
[18:22.50]It's like, you're past close.
[18:24.64]Yeah.
[18:25.78]This is past close.
[18:31.17]I really can't believe you've been wanting to play this game.
[18:33.27]I don't know why.
[18:33.77]It's just local co-op, and it was like, this game probably sucks.
[18:36.77]Yeah, that part wasn't a joke.
[18:37.87]He has wanted to play this game for the last three years.
[18:41.60]So if there's anyone to place the blame on here, I'm just making sure it's clear.
[18:45.12]It's absolutely clear.
[18:46.56]I'm not going to pretend it's not my fault.
[18:52.33]Is that blood?
[18:53.21]What the shit is going on?
[18:55.19]This is like a flash game you can play with the controller.
[18:58.50]Yeah.
[18:59.46]This does feel like a game that's on mini-kill.
[19:02.14]Alright, we're going in the house?
[19:06.46]How do we go in?
[19:08.24]I believe we go around the house.
[19:09.53]You can't even go into the... Whoa, there's Death.
[19:12.91]Remember that character from Family Guy?
[19:14.89]Wow, what a good reference.
[19:17.99]She's not dead yet, but she's gonna be.
[19:19.77]Apparently, because Death is here.
[19:22.98]And he's got a very busy schedule.
[19:24.50]What in the name of fucking God is happening right now?
[19:28.26]Why are we here?
[19:29.20]Why are we in the trenches here?
[19:31.28]I don't know.
[19:33.30]No.
[19:38.59]I'm not.
[19:38.93]Get the bag of money!
[19:39.73]Get the bag of money!
[19:40.59]Sorry, you can't jump that high.
[19:44.64]Thank God.
[19:46.68]I think it's over.
[19:51.36]I think I've suffered enough.
[19:52.56]I can't do it.
[19:54.48]I'm sorry.
[19:55.00]Brings me all the way out here to play Family Guy.
[19:57.54]I fucking can't believe I did that.
[20:03.52]Gonna need something stronger than that before the end of this stream.
[20:06.57]I can't believe you actually, if you actually, like, without even any joking, they're, like, fucking around.
[20:13.06]You flew out here.
[20:13.94]Mm-hmm.
[20:15.50]For us to play the Family Guy game on stream.
[20:17.62]Mm-hmm.
[20:18.32]Yeah.
[20:20.15]My only concern and wish is that we had thought of a second game to play besides Family Guy.
[20:24.04]Well, it's okay.
[20:24.48]We do have a second game to play besides Family Guy.
[20:26.18]Oh, good.
[20:26.54]It's funny that you say that.
[20:27.36]You actually... Don't worry about that.
[20:29.84]We're fine.
[20:30.08]We're going to move on to the next one.
[20:31.22]I slept in the airport to play Family Guy.
[20:33.18]Yes, you did.
[20:34.78]That one was confirmed didn't work, but it's all right because we got... People are going to be real unhappy.
[20:45.02]I can already tell you.
[20:46.55]I think they already are.
[20:47.73]Are you guys already unhappy?
[20:49.19]Because you're about to be real.
[20:50.17]I need to mute this microphone.
[20:51.51]Not the microphone, the desktop audio because I don't want people to know what this is.
[21:00.76]For good reason.
[21:02.28]For real good reason.
[21:04.38]No, they're getting excited about something that is not happening.
[21:08.32]You shouldn't be excited for this at all.
[21:10.96]Not at all.
[21:11.46]It's not what you think it is.
[21:12.58]It's not FIFA.
[21:13.60]You would not be able to guess.
[21:15.32]Anyone who could guess what we're about to play, I would give an actual sum of like $300.
[21:21.98]Well, here we go.
[21:25.02]It's worse than what we just played.
[21:27.98]Arguably.
[21:30.24]Okay.
[21:37.49]This is a local co-op only stream, guys.
[21:40.31]You know what games are local co-op only?
[21:42.57]Times are tough in the local co-op world right now.
[21:44.97]Local co-op only is like licensed games.
[21:48.84]Do a fucking research.
[21:50.00]It's licensed games and shitty indie games.
[21:52.28]That's all.
[21:55.02]And now you have to hit start.
[21:57.68]Do I get to be the guard male or do I get to be... I did not see this movie.
[22:01.23]I didn't see this movie either.
[22:02.71]We're going to watch the whole movie.
[22:10.23]generic, like, zoo tycoon noise.
[22:12.37]Oh, already running very poorly.
[22:16.87]I think that's gonna be you.
[22:18.57]I get to be Baloo?
[22:19.75]You get to be Baloo, and I get to be the... This is supposed to be local code.
[22:24.13]Do research, guys.
[22:25.34]Come on.
[22:26.02]See, he's gonna be the bear.
[22:27.40]Wait, in the movie, is the bear the mom?
[22:31.58]But where am I?
[22:33.28]What do I get?
[22:34.22]I'm the bear.
[22:34.70]Okay, cool.
[22:35.18]Are you actually the bear?
[22:35.78]Yeah, I'm running off screen.
[22:36.76]Okay, cool.
[22:38.34]Push square to move.
[22:39.62]What the fuck is square?
[22:41.44]Press start.
[22:43.42]There we go.
[22:43.94]It's me, the spirit.
[22:45.42]You get to be the jellyfish.
[22:48.10]Why can I only move in straight lines left or right?
[22:50.74]We get to play Mario Galaxy.
[22:52.96]You get to be the star.
[22:54.76]You get to be the child that's playing alongside the dad.
[22:58.02]At least I get to move faster than you.
[22:59.66]To pretend like you're doing something.
[23:02.98]I'm going to get to kill the enemy so they don't kill you.
[23:06.76]Like, I can't die in this game.
[23:08.04]Do you think I'm gonna last longer in this one, or will Family Guy Multiverse be the... Where's the bar here for this?
[23:15.92]The bar is I'm not just mindlessly shooting a guy three times and he falls over in a canned animation.
[23:24.54]I'm more on board with this game right now.
[23:26.20]That's how bad Family Guy was.
[23:28.92]We're gonna look at the bits here in a second.
[23:34.15]Who cares?
[23:34.71]This movie came out like nine years ago.
[23:36.48]Okay, this game's already better because you can skip all the cutscenes.
[23:38.72]All right, so there's a chest here.
[23:40.68]I don't know what the yellow button is.
[23:45.00]What is yellow square?
[23:46.80]Here's a fine weapon.
[23:48.58]Okay, I get a sword.
[23:50.26]So that works for me.
[23:52.60]Why are you quitting?
[23:53.33]Don't quit.
[23:55.03]No.
[23:56.93]Did you just quit the game?
[23:58.61]Go ahead.
[23:59.49]You're fine.
[24:00.33]You're doing a great job.
[24:02.07]You have to help me out with this.
[24:04.38]This is just me playing like the brave.
[24:05.92]I don't want to stunt your growth, okay?
[24:07.52]You're a small girl, you need, growing up in the world, this is a harsh world of strange accents and red-haired maiden lasses.
[24:15.81]And I don't want to stunt your growth.
[24:17.01]Can you do anything?
[24:20.21]Yes, I can smash some boxes.
[24:23.47]Step on the stones in the correct order.
[24:25.03]So it's one, two.
[24:26.17]Unfortunately, I have no weight behind my ethereal form, so me standing on them doesn't do anything.
[24:35.52]Screen cheat.
[24:36.92]No, we're not playing listen this games that it's a good point, but Don't worry.
[24:43.71]We've got plenty of coat.
[24:44.47]We got Cuphead co-op as well.
[24:46.79]Excuse me We're just doing like I have a bone.
[24:50.87]It's funny because Cuphead was what $15.
[24:52.41]Mm-hmm.
[24:53.83]How much was this game?
[24:55.98]20 How much was family guys 50
[25:00.68]Let alone Alice in Wonderland, which we found out later we can't play, which was also 20.
[25:04.37]Well, that's going good so far.
[25:11.09]You have a health bar, by the way.
[25:12.97]I do too.
[25:14.14]You do too.
[25:15.58]I have spirit health.
[25:16.66]So follow up.
[25:17.30]I'd better find a potion for my health.
[25:19.62]All right, now do it again.
[25:21.84]Do it again.
[25:24.89]Do it again.
[25:29.84]If you can't die.
[25:30.65]I think that's just there to make people not get their life all the way.
[25:33.31]It's there just to, like... Actually, pretty fucking... Pretty clean controls here.
[25:39.73]Talked a lot of shit about this game.
[25:41.07]And, like, to add the bow and arrow is probably the best bow and arrow I've played in a game.
[25:44.17]You just gotta wind it up.
[25:46.76]I'm serious.
[25:47.30]Aim it.
[25:48.34]3D motion controls.
[25:49.18]You're giving this game a lot of shit.
[25:50.32]And now it's, like, actually pretty fun.
[25:54.36]Can I sprint?
[25:56.26]No.
[25:57.53]Where did I go?
[25:59.93]I just disappeared off the screen so Baloo could talk to us.
[26:05.17]We have to get the bear.
[26:06.03]This is the Horizon Zero Dawn DLC.
[26:10.32]Once I shoot the bear, I'm going to put an arrow right through his head.
[26:12.82]I don't like that you can leave me off the screen and I have to teleport back to you.
[26:16.44]Just like Super Mario.
[26:21.08]I don't know why we're even still in this.
[26:23.63]Alright, once, I just gotta get the bear.
[26:25.05]Come on.
[26:27.01]Alright, every, stop it.
[26:30.82]Stop it.
[26:38.50]I thought we could skip cutscenes.
[26:39.82]Oh, we can.
[26:40.18]No, no, no.
[26:40.92]You have to calm down.
[26:43.06]You have to calm.
[26:44.74]You need to chill.
[26:45.64]You need to calm down.
[26:47.42]Every time she has a thick Scottish accent, we're going to drink.
[26:50.66]We're going to need more.
[26:51.76]All right, he said drink, not like.
[26:53.86]She's not stopping.
[26:55.32]He said drink, not drain.
[26:56.12]She's not stopping.
[27:08.32]All right, let's go.
[27:09.90]They're gonna die.
[27:13.10]All right, here we go.
[27:14.08]This is the beginning of... What was that game?
[27:18.62]What was that game?
[27:19.72]What was that game with the portals?
[27:21.04]We played it.
[27:21.50]It was the game... With portals?
[27:23.82]No, no, no, no.
[27:24.58]It was a game where we played at PAX or something.
[27:27.06]It was like Dark Souls.
[27:28.88]It was way harder.
[27:29.64]It was like, wow, there's a million stances.
[27:31.77]Neo.
[27:32.19]Right, but remember?
[27:33.83]I do.
[27:36.22]Except the one problem is Nioh sucks.
[27:40.10]Brave confirmed better than Nioh.
[27:44.04]Did I just say Nioh sucks?
[27:45.14]I'm sorry.
[27:45.56]Developers of Brave went on to develop Nioh.
[27:47.72]I thought it was just us in the room.
[27:48.96]I'm sorry.
[27:49.38]I didn't mean it.
[27:49.86]I'm just kidding.
[27:50.58]Nioh was not bad.
[27:51.32]I was just drunk when I played it.
[27:52.72]Nioh's got like an 8 out of 10 on Metacritic.
[27:54.64]It's not bad.
[27:55.16]It's all right.
[27:55.56]It was fun.
[27:56.28]It wasn't that good, but it was fun.
[27:57.32]Like every other... Where are we supposed to go?
[27:59.60]I think you're supposed to do something.
[28:00.76]You're supposed to run in and sacrifice yourself in one of these portals.
[28:18.28]uh okay okay found it found the way to go oh let's go to the hobbit house the shire oh I found the magic rose
[28:42.37]I thought that was the bear.
[28:48.24]I thought that was the bear walking by the watch.
[28:50.82]Watch this.
[28:51.64]Watch the fucking bear go by.
[28:54.24]See?
[28:54.44]I thought that was the bear.
[28:57.71]Hey grandma!
[28:59.88]Let's go.
[29:01.24]Face cam streamers.
[29:03.04]We're still here.
[29:04.30]Kill the bird.
[29:06.32]All right.
[29:07.66]Now what?
[29:08.10]I think I can shoot one of these guys.
[29:09.12]We shoot like 10 times faster.
[29:11.13]Defeat all the enemies.
[29:13.15]No, I get it.
[29:13.85]It's a board game.
[29:17.01]Got to survive for like 10 waves.
[29:27.45]I just crashed the stream.
[29:28.93]I just crashed the stream by doing this.
[29:31.04]Thank God.
[29:31.96]I thought the whole stream was going down.
[29:35.72]Okay.
[29:36.90]Next on the table here.
[29:40.56]That was going to be so sad.
[29:41.92]I thought I just broke the whole stream.
[29:46.54]Hey, why don't you make yourself useful and go get us a couple more beers?
[29:50.78]You want one?
[29:51.26]Yeah.
[29:51.72]Of course I do.
[29:55.94]What's the next one we're going to do?
[29:57.54]Oh shit, Brave is still running.
[30:01.30]Came all the way here to be the maid.
[30:03.46]Don't smash my PlayStation 3 with the controller.
[30:06.41]That thing is worth a lot of money.
[30:17.51]Why did you just power up?
[30:20.56]You just leveled up.
[30:24.53]You go ahead and make yourself useful and get us a couple more fuckin' beers!
[30:26.81]Uh, anyways, the next thing we're gonna play... Alright, this next one people are gonna like.
[30:35.14]I promise.
[30:35.98]This next one, you guys are gonna like this next one.
[30:39.74]Stand up for yourself.
[30:44.20]Uh, this is... You guys are gonna like this one.
[30:47.87]Oh, shit, bits.
[30:48.43]That's right, that's right.
[30:48.97]Hold on.
[30:49.27]Bits.
[30:51.97]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[30:53.19]A lot of people gave fits already.
[30:54.21]It's only been like 20 minutes.
[30:56.25]We've played two games in like 30 minutes?
[30:58.56]Fuck.
[30:59.94]I only got like five more games to play.
[31:03.68]And then co-op stream part two tomorrow.
[31:05.38]Don't you wait to see what we got for you tomorrow.
[31:07.20]You'll see.
[31:07.54]It's going to be fucking great.
[31:09.12]Anyways, let's go through these quick while he goes and gets us a couple of fucking other drinks.
[31:13.65]Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[31:14.77]Hey Germans, Alex, today's stream will probably be climactic.
[31:19.73]Whether the fanatics are erratics, clarismatics, democratics.
[31:24.75]I can't.
[31:26.92]That's in one ear.
[31:27.82]My brain can't even handle this one.
[31:29.62]But thank you.
[31:30.87]All right, what do you think?
[31:32.27]Rapid fire?
[31:32.67]He's coming down in a minute.
[31:33.69]We got to do rapid fire.

[31:41.46]Thanks a lot, man.
[31:44.10]That's a fucking lot of money.
[31:45.50]German Discord podcast represent, huh?
[31:53.07]You know what's... I'm so used to no one, like, being down here that I thought I was going to die.
[31:59.73]I thought you were, like, a murderer here to, like, strangle me.
[32:04.93]Hey.
[32:05.13]Remember that one?
[32:08.10]Why don't you open it?
[32:10.20]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[32:16.22]Okay.
[32:18.88]Now we can open it.
[32:22.06]You're safe, I think.
[32:22.82]Why are you holding it at me?
[32:24.80]Don't aim it at me.
[32:25.38]It's fine.
[32:27.47]It's good this time, guys.
[32:28.51]It's what I'm supposed to do the first time around.
[32:31.47]Plonker, thank you, Plonker, is mad for the ten bucks.
[32:33.51]Italics backwards is X, Y, late.
[32:38.65]Very observant of you.
[32:39.39]Thank you.
[32:41.61]Archmage Moleking, thanks for the bits.
[32:43.31]Coolcat, thanks for the bits.
[32:44.65]Leferl, thanks for the bits.
[32:45.93]Did we already read Italics sounds way fatter than he actually is?
[32:51.72]Did we read that one?
[32:53.04]You sound fatter?
[32:54.22]Yeah, I sound way fatter than he actually is.
[32:56.88]I'll take that one as a compliment.
[32:58.74]How do you sound fat?
[33:00.56]I sound fat.
[33:01.74]That's what it says.
[33:02.60]When you have too much here and it sounds like this, that's when you have too much cheek, right?
[33:09.61]He doesn't have very much cheek.
[33:10.99]He's fine.
[33:14.37]But thank you, though.
[33:14.93]Thank you, guys.
[33:15.57]We're going to rapid-fire these ones.
[33:17.26]We're playing another local co-op game.
[33:20.58]Local co-op is a fucking serious business, as you can tell.
[33:23.14]So, ArchmageMulking, thanks for the 45 cents.
[33:27.18]CoolCat, LaFurl, Tar, thanks for the two bucks.
[33:30.77]Hey, Archmage, what's up?
[33:32.33]CypherDude, thanks for the one dollar.
[33:33.77]ShortStreamer wears high heels.
[33:34.99]We already looked at my socks.
[33:35.97]Bullshit.
[33:36.57]You can't fucking use that one against me.
[33:38.61]Cypher dude, thank you though.
[33:40.35]Kill Cannon, thanks for the 49 cents.
[33:42.54]Tar again, $1.
[33:43.26]Never expected italics to be this good looking.
[33:48.96]Alright.
[33:50.60]That's right.

[35:31.62]It's because you got the button.

[41:38.08]Got to do your homework tonight.
[41:39.70]Where's my backpack?
[41:46.74]It's Alex's.
[41:47.03]You have to help me here.
[41:47.79]Listen.
[41:48.25]Do I have to get my basketball?
[41:49.81]No teammate available at the moment.
[41:50.95]Well, you have to wait until I find you.
[41:52.21]You're probably locked somewhere.
[41:52.99]I am the basketball.
[41:54.37]Can I pick up the basketball?
[41:55.53]Do I have to take it with me?
[41:59.35]This one was a little more strenuous.
[42:01.29]You were out of breath a bit for that one.
[42:05.07]I'm getting a call.
[42:06.75]I'm getting a call to my Nokia.
[42:09.43]How do I open the phone?
[42:10.35]Damn.
[42:11.53]That must be Ashley calling me.
[42:13.29]Oh, here we go.

[42:20.16]All right.
[42:20.54]Eventually, I'm going to get you.
[42:21.46]Don't worry.
[42:21.94]We can play together.
[42:22.66]I'm Ashley.
[42:24.00]This is the phone.
[42:25.91]Nice FNV transition there, I must say.
[42:27.63]Told you.
[42:28.35]That's you.
[42:28.67]That's me.
[42:28.91]I'm pretty hot.
[42:29.41]Excuse me.
[42:29.69]Who's on the wall there?
[42:30.41]Last time you were late.
[42:46.57]There's a fucking joker over there.
[42:47.69]Look at the joker.
[42:48.19]Too many free throws.
[42:49.51]Look at the joker.
[42:50.03]What are you pressing?
[42:58.23]Don't press.
[42:58.59]It's pretty much me.
[43:00.27]He looks like me.
[43:01.74]Pretty buff.
[43:02.26]He doesn't look like you.
[43:03.46]That looks like me.
[43:05.83]Shoots freeze, free throws, 100% accuracy.
[43:09.45]I can do that.
[43:09.79]Pretty much like me.
[43:10.56]I can shoot pretty well.
[43:11.62]Let's settle the debate once and for all.
[43:13.56]Who does this look like?
[43:14.22]Watch this.
[43:14.54]Ready?
[43:15.82]Special attitude?
[43:17.30]Huh?
[43:17.44]All right, hold on.
[43:21.10]I want to get a close-up so we can see who this actually looks like.
[43:25.15]His head is currently eclipsed.
[43:27.11]I'm going to get into a wall or something.
[43:28.71]Oh, by the way, Justin, I'm not doing it again.
[43:34.15]I can't look.
[43:36.41]Smart cam.
[43:37.27]Sorry, I'm looking for somebody that stole my shit.
[43:41.75]Stop mashing buttons, you can play in a minute.
[43:47.01]All right.
[43:48.95]Why is that off the screen?
[43:51.25]What was that?
[43:52.77]That's $100.
[43:54.51]What?
[43:55.21]Somebody gave $100.
[43:55.61]Oh, that's your notification.
[43:57.33]I thought that was in the game.
[43:58.87]I thought.
[44:02.72]Oh, the game did it.
[44:03.78]Oh, alright!
[44:05.20]Is that like the guy said that?
[44:06.86]Yeah, I thought it was like outside the door.
[44:09.14]Alright!
[44:11.28]I was like, this doesn't fit the tone of this horror game at all.
[44:16.83]Rent-a-cat, thank you.
[44:17.95]Oh my fucking god.
[44:19.35]Alright, by the way, Italics gets like 8% of this money.
[44:25.67]Alex gets like 4% of his money.
[44:27.19]I'm going to put it in my piggy bank.
[44:29.09]No.
[44:29.87]But for real though, Rent-A-Cat is 100 bucks.

[45:02.10]What?
[45:06.14]Who are you looking at?
[45:08.64]Muse Elk?
[45:10.04]We can do better.
[45:11.40]We can do better.
[45:12.89]I've seen Muse Elk in real life, and it wasn't like looking into a mirror.
[45:16.45]It was like looking into somebody who wished they could be as good looking as this.
[45:24.62]Oh fuck, I'm moving the game around.
[45:26.34]God, now say that again.
[45:28.64]Again?
[45:29.00]Yeah, say it again.
[45:35.10]Muzok.
[45:35.96]I've met Muzok in real life.
[45:37.54]It wasn't like looking into a mirror.
[45:39.24]It was like looking into the eyes of someone who wished they could be as good looking as this.
[45:47.53]Yeah, cheers to that, by the way.
[45:48.59]Cheers to that.
[45:49.75]Except you're not going to get cheers.
[45:50.77]Remove this.
[45:52.29]This is a pre-recorded stream.
[45:56.21]Move back down there.
[45:58.63]That's better.
[45:59.15]No, that's way too small.
[46:01.09]That's way too big.
[46:02.31]How do I Goldilocks this?
[46:03.21]There we go.
[46:04.25]That's better.
[46:05.95]All right.

[46:30.30]This is just the extra game.
[46:31.70]This is the next game.
[46:32.48]This is the next part of it.
[46:33.64]This door's locked.
[46:35.76]Don't worry.
[46:36.12]Eventually, you... What am I doing?
[46:39.69]You're tired.
[46:40.27]You gotta recover that stamina.
[46:43.79]You're gonna unlock soon enough.
[46:44.89]What's this?
[46:46.59]The door's locked with a padlock.
[46:47.61]Can't do anything about that.
[46:48.85]Well, puzzle game.
[46:50.92]Look at all these locked doors that you can't open yet, but you'll eventually be able to.
[46:56.22]Another $50 fucking dollars.
[47:00.84]Who gave the $50 bucks?
[47:01.72]Cigaretti spaghettis.
[47:03.44]Cigarette spaghetti.
[47:05.26]Thanks for the $50.
[47:05.68]I'm back, Jeremy.

[47:11.21]Cigarettis.
[47:11.91]Well, he's getting 2% of that, so.
[47:13.29]Did you hear that?
[47:15.57]I did.
[47:16.86]Sounded like more bits.
[47:18.28]No, there's also someone in the bush.
[47:19.52]Somebody's like in a bush.
[47:20.28]It's me.
[47:20.92]It was me.
[47:21.42]What is it in the tree?
[47:25.45]There's no bushes around here.
[47:27.23]Use the basketballs.
[47:30.01]But Cigarette Spaghetti, thank you so much, man.

[47:45.04]And they say... Oh, you found it.
[47:46.92]Good.
[47:47.12]Oh, God.
[47:47.66]We're going back into the gymnasium.
[47:49.68]100% of this goes to the tallest streamer in the room.
[47:53.14]You just made $15.
[47:53.74]I did.
[47:54.30]Yeah, you made $15.
[47:56.04]So $15, 2% of that.
[47:56.58]So I get 2% of that.
[47:57.30]No, it was 4%.
[47:57.92]Oh.
[47:58.02]So I get 2% of that transaction.
[47:59.44]Right.
[47:59.62]So I get 4% and you get 2%.
[48:00.18]Yes.
[48:00.26]CigaretteSpaghetti said, drink, you bitch, for $50.
[48:12.83]This is not supposed to be like a drink stream.
[48:16.83]You didn't even fucking cheers to that.
[48:18.07]Cheers to that.
[48:19.78]What a dick.
[48:24.60]It's gone.
[48:24.92]Thank you, Cigarette Spaghetti.
[48:28.94]Can we get out of the tutorial?
[48:30.30]But Cigarette Spaghetti, fucking 100 bucks total.
[48:31.80]Thanks a lot, man.
[48:33.00]That's a lot of money.
[48:34.75]You guys spoiled the shit out of me and him.
[48:37.05]I'm up at 4%.
[48:39.89]It's a good return on investment.
[48:43.75]What the fuck am I doing?
[48:45.15]All right, get me out of here.
[48:47.02]Get me out of here.
[48:49.62]I need to find you so we can do the actual game.
[48:51.78]Pay attention.
[48:52.34]Stop reading bits and play the video game, man.
[48:54.54]Come on.
[48:55.24]People are giving money.
[48:56.36]People are giving real money.
[48:57.31]That's a lot of money.
[48:58.21]You have to acknowledge that fucking that was a lot of cash.
[49:00.93]If only money could buy our way out of this concrete box that we find ourselves in right now.
[49:06.22]Concrete box.
[49:07.24]Yeah, look at it.
[49:08.36]You're stuck in a big box.
[49:09.86]You've been running and checking all the doors, and they're locked each time.
[49:12.55]You check them.
[49:13.77]Anybody played this game before?
[49:15.51]Yeah, he told me.
[49:15.95]You know what he told me before the stream?
[49:16.99]Streamer loves money.
[49:17.61]He said, guess what the third game is.
[49:19.17]He said, this is a really good video game.
[49:21.30]It is a good video game.
[49:22.10]It's from 2005.
[49:22.82]I love this game.
[49:23.62]It's a good co-op game that you get to play.
[49:25.44]Just wait until we have a few more drinks and play Cuphead and fucking hate each other.
[49:31.43]You want to see who's a better gamer?
[49:32.53]Let's find that out right now.
[49:34.27]Who can hit this button faster?
[49:35.08]Just look up the walkthrough.
[49:35.78]No, no, no.
[49:35.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[49:36.56]This is important.
[49:37.14]So we can tell by gamer skill how fast you can hit a certain button.
[49:40.94]Like, for instance, Metal Gear Solid 1.
[49:43.56]Metal Gear.
[49:44.26]Metal Gear Solid 1, you get captured and you're tortured and you have to hit a circle as fast as you can.
[49:49.77]Spoilers.
[49:50.41]Everybody...
[49:52.45]Everybody always handed the controller to me because they knew I could do it really fast and I was guaranteed to make sure you could unlock that bandana.
[49:58.65]So we're going to find out who's better.
[49:59.81]Who's better at pressing the button faster.
[50:03.75]We'll start with the clear winner, which is me.
[50:06.28]So for instance, ready?
[50:07.04]So watch.
[50:14.38]Good luck.
[50:14.72]There's someone in the bushes still.
[50:18.96]Good luck.
[50:20.11]All right.
[50:20.33]I got to get a little warm up in.
[50:30.18]consistency.
[50:32.04]No breaks in between.
[50:33.08]It's still going.
[50:35.27]It ain't even done.
[50:35.93]Okay, now it's done.
[50:36.89]It's over.
[50:37.31]I'll show you how a real gamer does it.
[50:38.67]Okay, that's pretty fast.
[50:43.11]That is pretty fast.
[50:44.97]That's why they handed the controller to me on Metal Gear Solid 2.
[50:50.86]It's pretty fast.
[50:52.58]That's like the hand off the controller method.
[50:57.32]How do we play this game?
[51:01.38]I don't know.
[51:08.83]Are we actually getting this?
[51:11.35]How do I open this door with my hand?
[51:12.89]There's like a right trigger.
[51:14.13]What does it say?
[51:14.63]Locked with what?
[51:15.91]It's padlock.
[51:17.11]Cigarette spaghetti gate.
[51:18.75]Another hundred fucking dollars.
[51:20.05]Alright!
[51:24.30]I thought that was upstairs.
[51:30.04]Someone's breaking in the house.
[51:32.54]Someone's breaking in right now in real life.
[51:35.24]I thought somebody dropped a glass.
[51:36.70]Welcome our next special guest.
[51:39.36]The Home Invader.
[51:40.47]This game is fucking freaking me out.
[51:43.91]Thank you, cigarette spaghetti.
[51:46.15]That's fucking... Made another $4, dude.
[51:50.59]It's a good investment.
[51:51.53]It's a good investment.
[51:52.23]This was a great investment.
[51:53.51]It says, drink you bitch again.
[51:57.48]Cheers to that.
[52:10.46]Get it together, man.
[52:11.72]So sloppy.
[52:12.30]Why are we such children?
[52:13.52]All right, we're going to go in the locker room and check the other door.
[52:18.97]Anyways, thank you for real.
[52:20.55]No jokes.
[52:22.67]Cigarette, spaghetti, thanks a lot, man.
[52:24.81]That's a lot.
[52:25.35]Playing a game.
[52:26.55]You drunkard.
[52:29.21]We're going back to the gym.
[52:31.06]What did you guys expect from the fucking local co-op stream?
[52:33.70]We're going back to the gym.
[52:34.88]Hey, remember when I did this and it was funny?
[52:38.68]Locker room.
[52:39.06]All right.
[52:39.72]There's got to be something, man.
[52:42.54]Look, there's nothing else in the fridge.
[52:43.92]What do you want from me?
[52:44.62]No, there's a bottle of whiskey in like a fucking secret cabinet.
[52:47.52]There's a secret whiskey cabinet.
[52:49.22]That's hard.
[52:50.98]You want to... You're going to... You didn't even go look at yourself in the mirror to find out who you really look like.
[52:55.65]You know what?
[52:56.11]I actually didn't... No time to do my hair, he says.
[52:59.73]I wouldn't know what that means.
[53:00.83]There's always time to do my hair.
[53:03.15]Can I go anywhere else?
[53:03.83]Have a shower later, shower later.
[53:05.53]No.
[53:06.51]I think there's another vermin here, though.
[53:09.81]I can go this way.
[53:10.47]You just shut a locker?
[53:11.67]I just shut a locker with my face.
[53:15.05]I'm freaking out.
[53:15.56]This is the first level of the game.
[53:17.34]Like, this is when you first get control of your character.
[53:20.14]How hard could it possibly be?
[53:21.70]Like, we've been just fucking around.
[53:23.38]We haven't been paying any attention.
[53:24.66]We didn't watch the opening cutscene.
[53:26.12]We didn't watch the opening cutscene.
[53:29.65]I was assured this game was a masterpiece of 2005.
[53:31.67]There's a fence gate outside the gym?
[53:35.31]Yeah, somebody in chat, like, help us.
[53:39.93]Yeah, like, just this... We'd, like, just drank two drinks in five minutes.
[53:45.17]Yeah, it's true.
[53:46.87]Through the wooden door.
[53:49.20]Close camera.
[53:52.46]Reset.
[53:53.22]Watch this cutscene.
[53:55.08]Start over.
[53:55.96]Wait, you're supposed to be, like, the gamer.
[53:58.14]Why aren't you not paying attention?
[53:59.08]I'm not even in the game.
[54:00.38]Yeah, but you're supposed to, like, know where to go.
[54:02.97]Go bottom.
[54:04.23]Go down.
[54:05.41]Right there.
[54:06.25]Left.
[54:07.63]Right there.
[54:09.61]That's nothing.
[54:12.93]Who is the gamer again?
[54:14.79]Why would you even know that was here?
[54:17.37]I didn't know there was a garden.
[54:18.45]I didn't know there was a garden behind here.
[54:19.81]It's because you're not a gamer.
[54:21.69]Because you're not a gamer.
[54:27.07]I just got fucked on my own stream.
[54:31.13]All right, here we go.
[54:33.15]The sticky tape can be used to join two weapons together.
[54:35.15]Press A. Okay, I'll be the weapon.
[54:36.69]And the flashlight.
[54:37.45]No, I'm going to unlock you in a minute.
[54:39.87]I'm stuck in a cellar somewhere, and you have to release the cage.
[54:44.37]Watch the cutscene and pay attention, please.
[54:51.54]I'm the monster.
[54:52.82]No, you're not the monster.
[54:53.90]Wait, do you have the flashlight or the gun?
[54:55.28]Combine the weapon and the flashlight.
[54:56.26]Step one, hold the LB key down.
[55:00.00]Oh, there it is.
[55:00.36]Okay, sticky tape.
[55:01.98]Combine the weapon and the flashlight.
[55:02.95]Hold LB down, press A, and then to start the action, tape lamp two.
[55:11.99]To the gun.
[55:12.73]We're too far now.
[55:13.63]Okay, let's go.
[55:14.59]Got it.
[55:15.07]Good.
[55:15.59]Crafting system.
[55:16.63]Easy.
[55:17.55]Let's go down.
[55:18.33]2005 crafting.
[55:19.29]And then eventually when you unlock italics from a loot box.
[55:23.11]So I thought one guy held the flashlight and one guy held the gun.
[55:26.04]Just look.
[55:26.48]So why do you have both?
[55:27.66]Boost?
[55:27.92]What is boost?
[55:30.78]What does that do?
[55:31.18]Oh, it's a light boost.
[55:32.14]Yeah, it's a light boost.
[55:32.84]But you're walking towards the camera currently.
[55:34.74]What the hell?
[55:37.68]Are you getting a little scared there?
[55:40.28]I actually kind of was.
[55:42.26]I'll get him and he can do the gameplay.
[55:45.86]He can do the gameplay.
[55:47.28]Alright, activate light boost.
[55:49.68]Watch the temperature gauge.
[55:51.12]You have to scare the flies away with the light.
[55:53.92]The flies?
[55:54.68]The gauge shows how much the light is overheating.
[55:57.54]Wait until the bulb cools down before using the boost mode again.
[55:59.96]Who made this game?
[56:03.57]I don't know.
[56:04.83]Who cares?
[56:05.75]Alan Wake, 2005.
[56:06.81]No, sorry.
[56:10.95]Alan Wake was fun until Chapter 4, then the game became terrible.
[56:15.05]I didn't play it.
[56:15.93]Alan Wake was a really cool game until Chapter 4.
[56:17.83]What happened in Chapter 4?
[56:19.55]It was a bunch of bullshit.
[56:21.42]The story got all fucked up.
[56:26.86]Why is this entire game walking towards the camera?
[56:29.86]Where is this light coming from?
[56:31.86]Your flashlight, idiot.
[56:33.18]Yeah, I know.
[56:33.62]I'm a fucking moron.
[56:36.02]No, is it just tools?
[56:38.97]I promise eventually he will be unlocked.
[56:41.73]It's okay.
[56:42.15]They think I'm playing.
[56:43.55]I'm here to, like, watch.
[56:45.75]I'm just spectating.
[56:48.99]So, to be fair, we haven't been playing this entire stream, so... We kind of haven't.
[56:53.02]This has been like the... Here you are.
[56:54.16]Found you.
[56:54.40]Here I am, the crazy guy.
[56:55.60]There you are.
[56:57.72]I'm gonna hand you a gun and you're gonna stand up and you're gonna... This guy's been like trapped in the dungeon for like five years.
[57:05.09]What's with his eyes?
[57:07.35]Here we go.
[57:07.65]Found the first teammate.
[57:17.98]Wait, are there multiple teammates?
[57:19.40]I think so.
[57:21.57]He's nuts, guys.
[57:22.97]Don't leave me.
[57:23.73]The freed student is now your teammate.
[57:25.39]Use Y whenever you want.
[57:26.67]I do want to take control.
[57:28.35]Excuse me.
[57:29.03]When a teammate is with you, a second player can take control by pressing the start button.
[57:33.07]Do you want to take control of the teammate?
[57:34.89]Yes, I do.
[57:36.37]What button is A on a PlayStation?
[57:37.91]If we could just take a moment to explain what's happening.
[57:41.01]Just wait a minute.
[57:42.13]No.
[57:42.47]Do you want player two to take control of your teammate?
[57:44.55]I do.
[57:46.01]Okay.
[57:51.17]Stop doing that, you just quit the party.
[57:54.05]Okay, press start.
[57:58.53]Oh, you have to press A. Why do I push start and then you press A?
[58:02.52]Whatever, it's me now.
[58:04.02]I'm the injured, I'm not gonna, nevermind.
[58:09.52]I'm not gonna let you bully me and threaten to shoot me after I was just unlocked.
[58:18.82]Stand over there for a minute.
[58:19.80]All right, I got you.
[58:20.48]No.
[58:21.06]Like a green shirt alien boy.
[58:22.90]Can you do anything?
[58:23.91]No, I can't do anything.
[58:25.19]I'm just holding my gut because I had too many tacos tonight.
[58:27.81]You really?
[58:28.19]Ah, that was awful.
[58:30.49]Minus two.
[58:32.69]Too many tacos.
[58:33.41]Because I couldn't do the one that I wanted that they're doing.
[58:37.29]Couldn't do the one that I wanted that they're doing.
[58:41.29]I can't do that on stream.
[58:42.55]Okay, now you've got a gun.
[58:48.29]All right, which way, this way?
[58:49.19]They didn't give me any ammo.
[58:50.75]This door's locked.
[58:51.93]We go down?
[58:52.39]I love how I'm in control of the situation.
[58:57.76]I can't do anything except, I have a pretend gun right now.
[59:01.28]So where am I supposed to take you?
[59:04.92]This down here?
[59:07.68]No.
[59:08.46]I can't.
[59:09.00]I can't do the jokes that I want to do.
[59:10.90]Alright, well, get him!
[59:12.66]That one's up to you, man.
[59:13.54]What do you mean it's up to me?
[59:14.36]How many bullets do you have?
[59:15.20]I got none!
[59:15.82]Alright, can you see him?
[59:17.44]Yeah.
[59:17.76]Shoot him!
[59:19.84]Shoot him!
[59:20.96]Shoot this guy!
[59:22.06]Gotta do everything myself.
[59:23.50]I don't have any bullets!
[59:24.67]What do you mean you don't have any bullets?
[59:26.07]How do you shoot the gun?
[59:28.92]I'm out of bullets.
[59:30.08]I don't have any left.
[59:31.13]He's on my leg.
[59:32.09]LT and an X. LT and X. You don't have the gun equipped.
[59:35.73]Did you throw the gun?
[59:36.77]I may have thrown the gun.
[59:38.53]It's definitely gone.
[59:39.90]He's biting my ankle again.
[59:43.96]Where's the gun?
[59:45.20]You have a gun.
[59:50.29]You can get me.
[59:51.11]You can save me.
[59:52.89]Poor thing.
[59:53.47]He didn't deserve that.
[59:54.49]Am I permanently dead?
[59:55.93]You're permanently dead.
[59:57.01]I'm permanently dead.
[59:59.23]No way.
[60:00.71]Is this a permadeath game?
[60:04.90]I can't go anywhere.
[60:05.76]You locked us back here.
[60:07.44]You just spit right in my face.
[60:10.44]You spit directly into my fucking mouth.
[60:12.54]I got a talc to spit in my mouth.
[60:19.34]I can't.
[60:20.34]I can't.
[60:22.42]I just got the character.
[60:24.24]That was supposed to happen.
[60:32.75]That was supposed to happen.
[60:33.83]It was?
[60:34.25]It just leads into the next cutscene.
[60:37.71]This is Dark Souls.
[60:38.41]Cheers to that.
[60:45.88]You poor thing.
[60:46.84]He basically kissed.
[60:47.94]It's as close as you're gonna get.
[60:50.80]Main villain.
[60:51.44]Mr. Garrison.
[60:54.22]Why does this remind me of Bully?
[60:56.36]These two characters are in Bully.
[60:58.46]Yeah.
[60:58.66]Yeah.
[61:14.55]How many levels of Cuphead do you think we can beat on Expert?
[61:17.22]Including the first world?
[61:20.32]At least the first world.
[61:21.36]Probably.
[61:21.86]But... But what?
[61:22.14]Sorry.
[61:22.26]What are you doing?
[61:23.00]I accidentally pushed start twice in a row.
[61:25.24]So I could be a new character.
[61:47.46]What is the matter with you?
[61:49.42]Can you be somebody?
[61:51.44]No teammate available at the moment.
[61:53.23]See, when you skipped it and it was... Alright, that kills you.
[62:00.09]Just steal shit from the vending machine.
[62:03.27]Just take all the energy drinks.
[62:06.31]What do you think about that one?
[62:10.07]You're like beating his lady with like a bat.
[62:13.21]I just know there's something else.
[62:14.84]There must be something about a monster.
[62:15.80]There must be something else here.
[62:16.84]It's a glass door.
[62:21.30]Good job.
[62:21.82]Gamer sense.
[62:22.42]Don't cut yourself.
[62:26.82]Got a reel of wire.
[62:28.64]Reel of wire.
[62:30.99]Nobody can stop.
[62:32.05]You had your chance.
[62:33.89]You had your chance to be a teammate.
[62:34.95]I was supposed to die.
[62:36.21]I couldn't shoot the gun.
[62:37.63]This is obscure.
[62:40.18]Obscure.
[62:40.94]I love how you put the controller down.
[62:43.08]No, I have to.
[62:43.86]Look, it's right here in my hand.
[62:45.64]All right.
[62:48.36]Be gone a thought.
[62:50.28]PSU boys look thirsty.
[62:55.11]Cheers to that.
[62:56.53]Cheers to that.
[62:58.21]Down and all.
[62:59.13]Get rid of all of it.
[63:02.88]Thank you, Cigarette Spaghetti, for the $100 donation.
[63:08.34]You're up to well over a few hundred dollars now.
[63:13.27]That's a lot of money.
[63:14.99]That's a lot.
[63:15.65]We can't buy any more drinks without money until like 45 days from now.
[63:18.60]Yeah, we can't...
[63:24.41]What are you guys doing?
[63:27.14]Zahner just gave $100 and said, hey, Italics, show your DMs.
[63:32.10]Don't listen to him.
[63:33.08]You don't have to show your DMs.
[63:33.86]What do I get?
[63:34.52]You guys are giving $100, $100, $10.
[63:35.28]Jesus Christ.
[63:35.72]Thank you, Zahner.
[63:36.10]Cheers to that.

[63:38.53]Thank you, Daddy.
[63:56.60]Why did you?
[63:57.90]I'm not even going to fucking say a goddamn thing.
[64:02.10]Oh my god, why?
[64:03.56]Why did you do that?
[64:04.26]Now that's clipped forever.
[64:05.30]That's going to be on the internet forever.
[64:07.60]Un-fucking-believable.
[64:11.79]Who do you... Who do you want to be?
[64:15.11]Because you can select a teammate.
[64:16.79]You want to be this girl or this girl.
[64:18.03]Alright, just press start.
[64:21.35]Yeah, player two joins the game.

[64:36.00]I have a reel of wire somewhere around here.
[64:38.77]Stix just gave 100 bucks too.
[64:40.03]Italics gets 100% of this.
[64:43.11]Italics, you just paid $100.
[64:44.65]I just got $100.
[64:45.29]Hold on, I can do something with this.
[64:49.27]It's overwhelming.
[64:50.14]Stix, thanks for the 100 bucks.
[64:51.20]His honor, 100 bucks.
[64:53.14]Holy shit.
[64:54.46]How'd you do that?
[64:54.90]What are you doing?
[64:56.55]Don't you dare hit, no, I was almost at the end.
[64:59.83]I was almost done, oh my.
[65:03.95]You're not gonna permadeath kill me after I just got here.
[65:07.09]I have a monster energy drink.
[65:09.45]I'm gonna have to drink my monster.
[65:12.42]You're right, we do.
[65:13.86]I wanna be the character that has the bat.
[65:20.88]Player two, quit the party, no.
[65:22.34]No, wait, I wanna be this guy.
[65:24.64]How do you switch characters?
[65:25.84]Just go do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[65:27.66]Edgemon gave 100 bucks too.
[65:28.90]Let me join in on this fun.
[65:33.12]This is going to be like a fucking $1,000 stream.
[65:36.93]All right.
[65:37.63]All right.
[65:38.21]All right.
[65:39.47]Jesus.
[65:41.45]You guys are spoiling the shit out of us right now.
[65:44.69]That's like too much money.
[65:46.90]You guys are fucking yowzers.
[65:49.98]Thank you.
[65:50.58]Yowzers.
[65:51.79]Not gonna get another Yowzers to make.
[65:52.73]Thank you for the, like, thousand dollars, everybody.
[65:54.67]Holy shit.
[65:57.49]Thank you so much.
[65:59.19]You guys are fucking awesome.
[66:00.35]Thank you, guys.
[66:01.21]Thank you so much.
[66:02.67]All this money goes to my... Yeah, shit.
[66:07.59]I'm gonna put it in the fund for buying new beautiful co-op games like Family Guy.
[66:13.36]Cheers to that.
[66:14.10]For real, though.
[66:15.48]You guys are fucking too kind.
[66:20.29]Ooh, going in the boy's room.
[66:23.35]What's wrong?
[66:25.86]It's really stinky in here.
[66:27.36]I got to stop breaking stuff.
[66:28.68]No, we're good.
[66:30.32]Anything in here of use?
[66:32.30]How did I hit you with that?
[66:34.22]That's nauseating.
[66:35.68]It looks like we need the flashlight to get all the filth off the wall.
[66:38.50]Where am I?
[66:39.02]I don't know.
[66:42.50]I'm going to go this way.
[66:43.32]Family Guy Fund.
[66:44.80]Family Guy was only $50, not like $600.
[66:48.39]That way we can buy the sequel.
[66:49.57]No, I'm going to go in the girl's room.
[66:51.45]You go in the girl's room.
[66:52.68]I go in the guy's room.
[66:53.50]It's a free country.
[66:54.18]We can do whatever we want.
[66:57.68]Rent-A-Cat gave another $100.
[66:58.52]Where's that draft coming from?
[67:00.06]This is what it feels like to shop at Target.
[67:01.76]$1,000 stream.
[67:03.12]What's happening?
[67:03.96]Cheers to that.
[67:06.04]Open it.
[67:07.59]It cannot be opened without a tool.
[67:09.23]Oh, goddammit.
[67:09.85]We've got to get a tool.
[67:10.33]There's a penis on the wall.
[67:11.15]Rent-A-Cat just gave another $100.
[67:12.65]Rent-A-Cat.
[67:18.46]I'd rent you.
[67:19.98]That's... Fucking... This is like a money stream.
[67:24.80]And I'm still going to catch up with some of the bits from earlier, too.
[67:28.72]Holy shit, guys.
[67:31.07]Oh, Ben.
[67:31.65]Oh, my God.
[67:33.23]Oh, my God.
[67:33.91]It's happening.
[67:35.69]Jot gif.
[67:37.41]No.
[67:38.57]It's happening.
[67:39.49]All right.
[67:40.21]There it is.
[67:40.77]I don't think there's anything in it.
[67:43.74]Ben, you just gave $100 to say, hey-o.
[67:47.45]Hey, yo.
[67:48.11]Hey, yo.
[67:48.57]Well, hi.
[67:49.62]Hi.
[67:49.80]Hey, thanks for the $100.
[67:50.28]What's up, man?
[67:51.54]Hold on, wait.
[67:53.20]I have, like, wire and... Hold on.
[67:54.70]Wire and tape?
[67:55.14]What do you have?
[67:56.04]That's not good enough to get through the vent.
[67:57.40]We gotta go through the vent, but we need a tool.
[67:58.99]Wait, wait.
[67:59.27]I have... Ben, thank you for the fucking $100.
[68:00.97]You wanna go back in there?
[68:02.05]Thank you so much, dude.
[68:03.33]You wanna go back in?
[68:04.31]Go back.
[68:04.55]You give me 10 fingers.
[68:07.03]What?
[68:07.69]You give me ten fingers up there.
[68:09.33]The boost?
[68:09.93]You've never heard that term before.
[68:10.93]Ten fingers.
[68:11.63]No.
[68:11.91]It's a scary term to be saying in front of thousands of people.
[68:14.09]Where is that draft coming from?
[68:15.51]Ten fingers.
[68:15.99]Here we go.
[68:16.39]No.
[68:17.57]You boosted me.
[68:18.31]What do you want?
[68:18.79]Here.
[68:18.95]Can I hand this to you?
[68:19.75]Can it be opened without a tool?
[68:21.01]Whatever.
[68:22.99]Ben, seriously.
[68:24.19]All you guys.
[68:26.07]Thank you so fucking much.
[68:28.11]This place stinks.
[68:31.45]Impermanent marker.
[68:35.20]I can't, I just can't sometimes, like... You guys are fucking awesome.
[68:39.34]This is... I got an energy drink, wire, and tape.
[68:43.86]Come upstairs.
[68:47.96]Are you... Oh, God.
[68:49.90]Cigarette spaghetti.
[68:50.82]This is just going... It's cigarette-ies.
[68:54.93]But I like... Cigarette's easier for my feeble mind to say.
[68:59.64]This door?
[68:59.92]Yeah.
[69:01.02]He says, uh, 50 bucks from cigarette spaghetti.
[69:04.26]He says, are you tough enough to crush the can on your forehead?
[69:07.20]No, go... Really?
[69:09.70]You want me to do that on stream?
[69:11.28]Fine.
[69:14.61]You do it first.
[69:17.11]Don't try this at home, Metallics.
[69:19.13]I'm gonna get a concussion.
[69:20.15]Like, crush it this way?
[69:22.15]No, he just said crush the can on my forehead.
[69:25.47]Mm-hmm.
[69:26.47]So like sideways, not like... No, like this he's talking about.
[69:30.17]That's fine.
[69:30.55]I'm going to crush this can on my forehead.
[69:41.56]Oh!
[69:42.80]That's what he asked for.
[69:43.60]There you go.
[69:47.52]You got it.
[70:00.15]Show the camera.
[70:01.92]There it is.
[70:03.24]What are you doing?
[70:04.24]It's crushed.
[70:04.86]What are you doing?
[70:05.86]Gotta be a real man.
[70:07.78]He's lost his mind.
[70:08.78]That's like a $600 joke right there.
[70:11.20]I'm gonna have to take you to the fucking emergency room.
[70:15.06]Don't do that in front of your friends.
[70:16.28]It's not cool.
[70:16.84]It's not cool.
[70:18.73]He's like genuinely worried about you guys watching that at home, by the way.
[70:22.49]He's not worried about me.
[70:23.53]He's worried about you guys copying me.
[70:25.41]Oh my god.
[70:28.58]Hey, well, hey.
[70:29.86]Look at him.
[70:30.52]He's scratching his head.
[70:31.60]Are you all right?
[70:32.56]I'm fixing my hair.
[70:34.56]Don't you hit me.
[70:35.54]I've already hit myself.
[70:38.08]Oh, my fucking God.
[70:42.51]It looked cool.
[70:43.85]That's all you need.
[70:45.49]As long as you're okay.
[70:47.75]That's why I didn't do the front of the head, you know?
[70:49.89]Spare the forehead.
[70:50.67]You're going to split your skull open.
[70:55.54]Where are we even supposed to be going?
[70:56.86]I don't know.
[70:57.26]We're checking all the doors right now.
[70:58.57]Last door.
[70:58.77]Watch out.
[70:59.91]Got it.
[71:00.25]You handle it.
[71:01.25]Hospital bill, billion dollar joke.
[71:05.09]Stix Renegade gave 50 bucks.
[71:07.77]Hey, Talix, German ever dabs on stream?
[71:10.29]No.
[71:10.55]That's where I draw the line.
[71:11.75]You'd rather hit yourself in the head with a can than dab on stream.
[71:14.11]Yeah.
[71:15.98]Well, there you go, Stix.
[71:16.66]There's your answer.
[71:18.76]Thank you for the $50, though.
[71:19.92]Thank you so much.
[71:21.64]DZGen360, thanks for the $50.
[71:23.08]What's up, my dudes?
[71:25.42]This is where we get the tool.
[71:26.52]Thank you.
[71:27.44]Screwdriver was lost in this room.
[71:30.56]So we have to find the screwdriver in this room.
[71:32.20]Thank you, everybody.
[71:34.53]What?
[71:34.89]Definitely push that.
[71:35.77]Well, it's definitely over here.
[71:36.81]Maybe you just have to help me?
[71:41.31]Come over here and help do what we have to do at the same time.
[71:45.73]Get out of the way.
[71:48.57]Am I locking us in?
[71:54.37]Screwdriver, find it.
[71:55.59]All right, let's go open the door.
[72:02.14]Get out of there.
[72:03.68]Hey, get out of there before you hurt yourself again.
[72:05.90]Jesus Christ.
[72:12.40]What on earth just shook you?
[72:17.08]Don't tell me.
[72:17.76]I'm going to guess later.
[72:25.14]I don't know what's happening right now.
[72:26.59]I saw it in the chat already.
[72:27.73]Stay right there.
[72:28.41]Don't move.
[72:30.87]You understand?
[72:31.29]I'll be right back.
[74:10.40]Oh, hey, what's going on?
[74:11.53]Have you not moved?
[74:14.57]Have you moved?
[74:16.89]What is that?
[74:17.21]Were you just sitting here and staring at the camera?
[74:20.07]What are you doing?
[74:21.25]What the fuck are you doing?
[74:26.60]Nothing.
[74:27.18]I'm good.
[74:28.32]It's been fine.
[74:29.26]What was he doing?
[74:29.86]What were you doing?
[74:33.30]Oh, dear.
[74:33.92]I'm going to eat a Lunchables on stream.
[74:38.60]This is a Lunchables lunch combination.
[74:41.04]It's got a couple things in here.
[74:43.16]Turkey.
[74:44.22]Turkey and American Cracker Stackers.
[74:52.64]He taps twice.
[74:54.52]Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
[74:56.18]Is it old?
[74:57.40]No.
[74:58.08]Oh.
[74:58.52]But that's not supposed to look like that.
[74:59.94]It's not supposed to look like this.
[75:02.42]What does it look like?
[75:04.70]First of all.
[75:05.20]Show the camera.
[75:05.72]I'm going to show the camera here.
[75:06.88]Big screen.
[75:08.31]Do you guys see the black specs on this cheese?
[75:13.21]I just opened that.
[75:14.25]You see that, right?
[75:15.99]What is the black specs?
[75:17.63]Is that, like, Oreo cookie?
[75:19.81]So let me show you how we used to do this when I was a kid.
[75:21.27]What are you doing?
[75:21.69]What are you doing?
[75:22.19]What are you clicking on?
[75:23.25]Make it, like, big.
[75:25.13]Just have, like, another scene for big camera.
[75:27.07]No, we don't do other scenes.
[75:28.37]We just, like, drag.
[75:30.29]Oh, my God.
[75:32.45]All right!
[75:33.89]See that?
[75:34.17]Let me show you how we used to do this back when I was a child, okay?
[75:38.97]Cracker, right?
[75:40.25]You're going to eat this, by the way.
[75:41.53]Oh, I have to eat the moldy cheese?
[75:43.52]It's not mold.
[75:44.18]It's Oreo cookie in here, and it got all over it.
[75:46.26]So the Oreo got on the cheese.
[75:47.70]Yes, it did.
[75:48.10]Okay, so cracker.
[75:49.84]Then we take a piece of this bologna or ham.
[75:52.90]It's turkey, actually.
[75:53.74]It's mystery meat.
[75:55.10]So that stacks on like this.
[75:56.42]So you do one on top of the turkey on top.
[75:59.24]Yeah.
[76:01.16]Then, can you hold this like that?
[76:03.38]Like that?
[76:06.95]then you do one slice of the cheese like this classic on top like that like just like that you do another cracker another piece of the turkey on top so you're stacking it here that's how I used to do it at the lunch table another piece of cheese and whoa this guy this guy's going a little crazy here another cracker to top it off
[76:33.24]Now we got a full-on stack.
[76:34.98]He's not done.
[76:36.02]He thought he was done.
[76:36.78]Excuse me.
[76:37.20]No, he wasn't.
[76:38.42]Another piece of turkey.
[76:40.80]On top of that, that's when we start to involve the cookie here.
[76:43.46]Oh, boy.
[76:44.18]Cookie goes on there.
[76:45.94]Excuse me.
[76:47.90]Then another cracker.
[76:49.81]Then another piece of turkey.
[76:51.35]The cracker does not... We lost one.
[76:53.43]It's all right.
[76:54.99]Sometimes it happens.
[76:56.19]The janitor will get that.
[76:57.35]Another piece of cheese.
[77:00.87]And we top that off with one last cracker, one last cookie, and the cheese, the turkey, and the cracker that sits on top.
[77:16.42]So it takes a large bite, which Italics is going to do.
[77:27.62]That's how we used to do it at the lunch table.
[77:33.74]For scale.
[77:34.58]For scale.
[77:35.90]It looks like... You're going to have to eat this sideways.
[77:39.05]You can't possibly eat it vertically.
[77:41.19]No, you have to eat it vertically.
[77:42.31]No, you can't.
[77:42.85]It's impossible.
[77:43.79]How are you going to do that?
[77:46.31]You've got to go in for the gut.
[77:49.75]That's how I... Look, I'll show you how I used to do it.
[77:52.36]You go like this.
[77:53.78]This whole thing goes... You're going to regret this.
[77:59.64]Like this.
[78:00.04]Ready?
[78:00.24]I'm going to
[78:05.69]It's not possible.
[78:06.33]It's not possible.
[78:06.89]It's actually physically impossible.
[78:08.09]No, I was... No, I can't do it.
[78:12.85]You have to go from the side.
[78:16.13]What else is in there?
[78:16.69]Is there a juice in here?
[78:17.92]No, it's just the cookie.
[78:19.22]The cookie is the only reason why you get the Lunchables.
[78:22.02]Nobody cares about the crackers.
[78:23.06]But you can go in like this.
[78:24.48]This is like a good stack.
[78:27.34]No, you can't go in like that.
[78:28.22]I think you can go inside...
[78:34.55]Man is going to choke on stream.
[79:03.41]Here, give that to me.
[79:10.18]You good?
[79:20.66]Mmm!
[79:29.98]Oh, yeah, so Jar was currently indisposed, so he's going to have me fill in for him while he chokes down that cookie sandwich, which is, you know, a classic at the lunch table.
[79:46.44]I mean, he did it, I did it, everybody did it, pretty much.
[79:51.71]So it's one that takes a little bit of adjustment if you haven't had it before, but once you go in the first time...
[79:58.34]You just have to remember to chew, to breathe through your nose because your throat's a little bit preoccupied.
[80:05.52]And then before you know it, it's gone.
[80:09.23]Before you know it.
[80:11.13]Let me just take a quick sip of my drink.
[80:17.71]We're playing a game, right?
[80:19.79]It was a game that was going on.
[80:30.93]Don't buy Lunchables, they're fucking garbage.
[80:37.71]Don't buy Lunchables, they're not good.
[80:40.85]Oh my God, this is fucking so much money that came in.
[80:45.19]I didn't spit it out, that was the drink I got.
[80:47.46]I got a bologna Oreo and cheese drink.
[80:54.24]Holy shit, guys.
[80:55.80]Where to even begin?
[80:57.67]Bob Jack, thanks for the $100.
[80:59.96]Buy yourself another Lunchables.
[81:01.12]They're like $4.
[81:03.00]Your cut can get that.
[81:03.90]Your 4% cut can get one of those.
[81:05.28]Yeah, I could get another one for the next stream.
[81:07.62]Thanks a lot, though, man.
[81:08.34]Thank you, Bob Jack.
[81:09.12]We could do that same joke again tomorrow.
[81:11.04]Yeah, we can.
[81:13.01]Rampaging Scrub, thanks for the $100.
[81:14.85]Jesus Christ.
[81:16.55]What Space Marine chapter from Warhammer 40k is your favorite?
[81:21.31]I've never... Have you played that game?
[81:23.57]No.
[81:24.51]I've never actually... I don't think I've ever played that game.
[81:26.55]Let me move this down.
[81:29.47]There we go.
[81:30.89]Thank you, though, Rampaging Scrub, for the $100.
[81:33.27]Mr. Figs, thanks for the $100 fucking bucks.
[81:35.11]Jesus.
[81:36.77]Coffee, cheese, nips, chicken.
[81:42.71]This is a joke.
[81:44.61]So close.
[81:45.41]So close.
[81:47.55]I want to read this.
[81:50.33]Hold on.
[81:51.77]10 grams, good source of protein.
[81:54.67]Keep refrigerated.
[81:55.43]Do not freeze.
[81:56.43]Where's the bottom of that?
[81:57.93]Who knows?
[82:00.57]Actually, that actually is not that bad.
[82:02.93]This whole thing is only 300 calories.
[82:04.63]That's it?
[82:05.55]Yeah, 330 for the whole package.
[82:08.63]It tasted pretty good when I did the whole thing there and that whole thing in one bite.
[82:11.71]It was good.
[82:14.27]Lots of cholesterol, lots of sodium, lots of saturated fat.
[82:18.09]Don't feed that to your children.
[82:20.31]They're not going to like it very much.
[82:21.79]At least it didn't ruin a keyboard.
[82:24.33]No, it did not.
[82:25.13]It was not liquid.
[82:26.06]Okay, let's...
[82:29.33]You wanna just, like, play Cuphead?
[82:31.11]Don't throw that.
[82:33.21]Don't throw that in the corner, because now I have to go get it.
[82:35.11]You wanna just play Cuphead?
[82:35.91]Uh, whatever.
[82:37.45]I'll play whatever.
[82:38.57]What do you guys wanna see?
[82:39.59]Do you guys wanna see Cuphead, or do you guys wanna see more of this dumb game?
[82:41.95]What do you want?
[82:46.02]Co-op Cuphead?
[82:57.12]What are you doing?
[82:57.68]Why are you breaking everything?
[82:59.10]I'm good.
[82:59.68]He's just like breaking shit.
[83:01.06]I'm not breaking anything.
[83:03.80]What's that shattered glass down there?
[83:08.65]Alright, well let's get to a position where we actually fight a monster here.
[83:12.87]I haven't shot anything this entire game.
[83:14.55]Man, what a fucking idiot.
[83:16.69]Seriously, I made that dumb joke and now I brought this down to put into here and now I can't do that.
[83:25.99]That's just whiskey.
[83:28.77]Actually, this is actually... I will eat that.
[83:30.17]I actually will.
[83:31.41]In like a few days.
[83:33.41]Once it's matured.
[83:34.11]Do me a favor.
[83:35.01]Get rid of this.
[83:36.17]What is this?
[83:36.59]Water?
[83:37.09]That is water, yeah.
[83:37.93]Oh, you chump.
[83:39.01]Get rid of that.
[83:40.16]That is water.
[83:41.20]Drink that water.
[83:42.14]Stay hydrated.
[83:44.06]You chump.
[83:47.94]Drink that and stay hydrated.
[83:50.06]Drink that and stay hydrated.
[83:54.10]Are you still here?
[83:56.27]I'm still here.
[83:57.31]You're still in the game?
[83:58.33]I am still here.
[83:59.19]Oh, I'm the one that's lagging behind.
[84:02.27]I just know there's something else.
[84:03.85]That's the wrong headphone, because we can only hear out of one headphone.
[84:06.96]What a mad lad.
[84:08.12]He really drank that water.
[84:09.86]I need to replace that with something.
[84:13.62]I'm going to have to pee so bad.
[84:14.80]It's all right.
[84:16.36]I can make your guy AI.
[84:20.83]Thank you.
[84:21.55]Let me see that.
[84:23.67]That one's all yours.
[84:27.70]Just enough.
[84:28.36]Just enough.
[84:30.44]Just enough.
[84:31.37]Don't try this at home.
[84:33.33]Unless you're over 21.
[84:34.51]Yes, unless you're over 21 or in Europe.
[84:36.43]By the way, don't try any of this stuff at home.
[84:38.77]Eating like lunchables, big stacks of lunchables, like hitting your head.
[84:41.49]You could choke.
[84:42.01]You could choke on that.
[84:43.09]You could get a concussion.
[84:43.71]Don't do that.
[84:44.79]Don't listen to him.
[84:45.59]No, listen to what he's saying.
[84:47.61]No, hold on.
[84:48.29]Listen to what he's saying.
[84:50.17]Listen to only this thing.
[84:51.04]Let's be real clear legally.
[84:53.60]Legally, let's be very clear about this.
[84:55.83]We've walked back and forth twice now.
[84:59.02]Do not eat a full stack of Lunchables in one bite.
[85:01.88]You'll choke.
[85:03.28]Do not drink unless you're 21.
[85:05.88]Do not smash your head with a fucking glass.
[85:08.32]It wasn't a glass.
[85:09.18]Whatever it was, don't do that at fucking home.
[85:11.06]It's not cool.
[85:11.76]It's not funny.
[85:12.64]He thought it was funny.
[85:13.32]It's not.
[85:15.74]What are we doing?
[85:18.59]It's closed.
[85:18.89]The lock seems to be rusted.
[85:20.05]Watch out.
[85:20.35]I can break it.
[85:21.35]There's nothing left for us.
[85:22.39]What's behind this door?
[85:25.15]Can you break that?
[85:26.97]Hold down to force a lock.
[85:28.13]I was trying to do that already.
[85:34.08]The lock seems to be rusted.
[85:35.04]Can you not do it?
[85:37.90]What about the screwdriver?
[85:38.96]Oh well, whatever.
[85:43.45]Didn't it just tell us to try to force the lock with that same tool?
[85:46.85]I think it did.
[85:47.87]Okay.
[85:48.63]I don't know then.
[85:50.75]It was both cool and fun.
[85:52.12]No, it wasn't.
[85:52.60]No, it wasn't.
[85:53.18]Don't encourage that.
[85:54.68]That's bad.
[85:55.10]Go back over here.
[85:56.52]Why do I control the camera?
[85:58.44]Don't encourage bad behavior.
[85:59.86]A map.
[86:03.76]I didn't do that.
[86:06.63]Stop.
[86:07.19]Look at the map.
[86:08.75]It's just two boxes.
[86:10.23]But you...
[86:12.47]Return to the gathering point.
[86:16.27]Can she do something important?
[86:17.71]Hit her.
[86:19.13]I think she has something.
[86:20.23]Hit her.
[86:20.43]Alright, let's go with these two.
[86:27.62]Eve's thanks for the 50 bucks.
[86:28.92]Seen some big donations and I've had a little... Oh my god, you...
[86:34.59]There's been so much money, right, in this stream.
[86:36.67]I need to make sure I catch up and don't miss anybody.
[86:38.89]Because there's a lot, like, without, obviously, like, he's like a giggling little mess right now.
[86:44.09]But, um.
[86:45.85]Is that right?
[86:46.87]Okay.
[86:47.21]In all honesty, you guys have, um.
[86:50.33]Yeah, thanks for calling me out.
[86:53.21]As much as we're just, like, fucking around.
[86:55.01]Thanks a lot, guys, for real.
[86:58.33]What do we do?
[87:00.21]I don't know.
[87:00.57]How do you play this game?
[87:02.17]I don't know.
[87:02.49]We really should be playing cockpit.
[87:03.49]Giggle streamer.
[87:04.37]If we, like, have a few drinks, we have to, like, think about what we're doing in this game.
[87:09.87]You missed at least one.
[87:10.67]I know I did, and I'm fucking terrible.
[87:11.99]I'm sorry.
[87:15.25]That door's locked.
[87:15.89]That door's locked.
[87:18.25]Isn't this whole game predicated on one person holds the flashlight and one person shoots?
[87:22.42]I thought so.
[87:23.06]That's what it looked like.
[87:27.86]That's closed.
[87:28.40]We can't get out.
[87:32.80]Try to keep up, man.
[87:35.80]No, we're going back in the, wait for the screwdriver.
[87:37.46]That was you.
[87:37.88]We have the screwdriver.
[87:38.96]We do.
[87:39.86]But that was in the girl's room.
[87:40.98]Let's go in the girl's room.
[87:43.50]Wrong room.
[87:48.76]Screwdriver, we can get in here now.
[87:51.30]This is obscure.
[87:54.22]That's where we need to go.
[87:56.08]Let's get up there.
[87:57.33]Where's that draft coming from?
[87:59.01]Up here.
[87:59.45]Okay.
[88:02.69]Fucking damn it.
[88:03.35]Give me a break.
[88:05.11]Can't be open without a tool.
[88:08.47]I will need help to be able to get to that grid.
[88:11.31]I can't be open.
[88:12.85]I have help right now.
[88:14.76]Stop.
[88:15.08]Stop it.
[88:15.46]Stop it.
[88:15.74]He did it again.
[88:19.96]I'm trying to open the door.
[88:21.68]Oh my lord.
[88:23.66]Okay.
[88:23.98]Screwdriver.
[88:24.62]Use.
[88:26.32]I got it.
[88:26.68]I got it.
[88:27.00]I got it.
[88:28.58]It is working.
[88:29.04]It's open.
[88:29.36]It's open.
[88:29.62]It's open.
[88:29.90]Push me in.
[88:30.66]Push me in.
[88:34.02]Oh, you might have to crawl through.
[88:37.90]Help me up.
[88:39.31]No point in going.
[88:39.89]Oh, we went out.
[88:40.25]We're already through.
[88:41.49]Oh.
[88:44.01]We're already in.
[88:45.65]We're already there.
[88:48.41]Flew them all the way from fucking goddamn.
[88:49.95]Damn, there's a, there's a. Where are you, where are you from?
[88:52.47]Like Canada?
[88:55.57]Flew them all the way to Boston to get here.
[88:57.83]And this is, this is what we do.
[88:59.95]We do like a cringy Lunchables thing.
[89:04.27]I'm never doing that again.
[89:05.35]Ever.
[89:07.97]I got a key.
[89:09.25]Watch me eat a bunch of Lunchables.
[89:10.62]I can do better than that.
[89:12.94]And he tried to get me to do it.
[89:14.10]He tried to push the joke off on the beat.
[89:15.94]Hold yourself to a better standard of comedy.
[89:20.87]Did you see I almost ate it in one bite?
[89:23.75]I need to go into the fucking solo room.
[89:25.81]There's a camera here.
[89:27.51]I need to lock myself into the solo room where it's this big.
[89:31.05]And I just sit there in silence.
[89:33.53]What?
[89:34.81]I don't know.
[89:37.05]Read the journals.
[89:37.89]Maybe you'll find out more about what we're supposed to do next.
[89:42.70]Why can't I have the bat?
[89:44.52]Because I'm the strong one.
[89:45.44]I think we're supposed to go upstairs.
[89:47.28]From here, you mean?
[89:48.06]I got it on the car?
[89:48.94]Yeah.
[89:49.96]Why did you open the bathroom door?
[89:50.82]I didn't know it was the bathroom.
[89:53.16]I'm bullying Chad.
[89:54.04]No, I'm bullying myself.
[89:56.17]because I did like a funny joke.
[89:58.07]It was so fun.
[89:58.89]A little bit more of that just to make sure.
[90:01.85]If you're over the age of 26, you can have some of that.
[90:03.85]I think we're getting close.
[90:08.40]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[90:09.22]We gotta solve a code.
[90:10.54]A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A

[90:30.43]Like when you were in high school, what were your grades?
[90:32.13]When I was in high school, I was the candy honor roll student who was probably like Ashley Thompson.
[90:40.92]Okay.
[90:42.58]Or like Peter Dodge.
[90:44.50]Okay.
[90:44.98]Well, I would be Stan Jones.

[92:14.86]Okay, good.
[92:15.77]Come down this way.
[92:16.37]See?
[92:16.95]Old game.
[92:17.59]No physics.
[92:19.47]Door's jammed.
[92:21.15]Any other... Let's open this this way.
[92:26.01]There's the way to go here.
[92:28.84]Puzzle game!
[92:29.86]Oh, come on.
[92:30.20]It's not all the way over.
[92:31.96]One more little push.
[92:35.84]Nothing.
[92:36.40]Maybe pull them out of the... That was a gun.
[92:37.76]Okay, move forward.
[92:39.58]Go.
[92:40.38]No.
[92:44.56]Yes.
[92:46.88]Don't leave the room.
[92:48.40]Go back in the room.
[92:49.61]We have to go that way.
[92:51.15]Do we, though?
[92:51.81]Yes.
[92:51.99]I just found a teacher's room key.
[92:53.45]But we didn't move this one to the right.
[92:54.87]The other bedroom, the teacher's rooms were like back the other way.
[92:58.23]Just watch.
[93:01.32]There's probably something like right here.
[93:02.96]Pick up.
[93:03.36]Show me.
[93:04.07]Pick it up.
[93:04.75]Show me.
[93:05.21]I don't know.
[93:05.95]There's something right there.
[93:06.75]Yeah, is there?
[93:07.55]I don't see anything.
[93:08.81]It's really weird how this is just an empty corridor.
[93:12.01]It's almost like we were supposed to get to the door that's over this direction that we couldn't get to before, but it's locked.
[93:18.23]All right, wait, wait, wait.
[93:18.78]So we can't go that way yet.
[93:20.06]We need one of these.
[93:20.68]We need a wheel.
[93:21.32]Yeah, we need a wheel.
[93:22.64]Can we go in here?
[93:23.12]No.
[93:23.70]All right, we got a teacher's key.
[93:24.84]Use the teacher's key.
[93:25.48]Remember where the teacher's room is.
[93:30.22]Remember when we were gonna play Cuphead?
[93:32.58]Remember when they were gonna play Cuphead?
[93:35.42]We are playing the adventure game.
[93:37.32]We will play Cuphead.
[93:39.06]Playing adventure stories.
[93:41.16]Find the key.
[93:42.56]There it is.
[93:43.12]Unlock the door first try.
[93:44.02]I know what the fuck I'm doing.
[93:45.68]They gave us the gun in the tutorial, killed us on purpose, and then took the gun away.
[93:49.24]I know what the fuck I'm doing.
[93:51.70]Door's locked, it's all right.
[93:52.76]Isn't this the same hallway?
[93:54.28]This is the same hallway, but we found the shortcut.
[93:58.09]It's the same hallway.
[93:59.54]Is it?
[94:00.34]Yeah.
[94:01.14]Don't you like when you can tell when the stream is, like, devolving into playing the video game?
[94:06.18]Like, that's when you know it's time to go to another game.
[94:08.69]Yeah, you're right.
[94:09.19]We're playing the game.
[94:10.47]You know what?
[94:10.75]You're right.
[94:12.75]No, he's right.
[94:13.17]He's right.
[94:13.99]Yeah.
[94:14.29]He's right.
[94:15.37]I'm going to play Obscure 2.
[94:21.19]He's right.
[94:21.61]And when you're right, you're right.
[94:23.83]You know what I mean?
[94:28.44]Let's get Obscure 2 up.
[94:30.16]Alright, you set that up.
[94:31.64]I'm going for it right now.
[94:33.58]You set that up.
[94:37.75]Oh, that exists.
[94:40.09]This is real.
[94:41.57]That was so fucking loud.
[94:43.57]I didn't know that was real.
[94:44.57]What do you mean, what was real?
[94:45.69]Obscure 2?
[94:45.91]I thought there was no sequel.
[94:48.39]I didn't know that that was the real game.
[94:56.76]How do you get out of here?
[94:57.76]What do you mean how do you get out of here?
[95:04.88]Controller.
[95:08.54]Xbox con... Why is it so shit?
[95:11.90]All right.
[95:21.85]Player one keystroke configuration.
[95:23.67]No, I want it to be...
[95:25.97]Xbox 360 controller.
[95:35.59]Player 2.
[95:36.45]No, not keyboard and mouse.
[95:39.88]Shouldn't that be... Okay, that's good.
[95:46.18]I can't turn this down.
[95:49.32]Alright.
[95:50.02]Obscure 2.
[95:52.10]Let's lower the volume and then turn it up from here.
[96:01.52]That sounds good.
[96:05.98]How's that?
[96:06.30]Is that good for you guys?
[96:07.26]Is that too loud?
[96:07.82]Let's make sure that's good.
[96:15.20]That's good, right?
[96:17.74]Okay, let's go.
[96:18.98]New game.
[96:20.14]Two players.
[96:20.60]You're starting the story in two-player mode.
[96:23.34]If any time, the second player can leave the game by pressing the enter key.
[96:26.83]No, no, no.
[96:27.11]Not the enter key.
[96:27.75]The fucking controller.
[96:28.65]He has a controller.
[96:33.87]I always thought that urban legends were fairy tales, but two years ago... You guys didn't play nothing.
[96:39.66]An old and respected educational institution that was run by the Friedman brothers, Leonard and Herbert.
[96:45.74]That looks so hostage.
[96:46.98]...specialized in experimental botany.
[96:49.26]We've been just having fun.
[96:51.03]Local, fun, IRL joke stream.
[96:53.87]So imagine we played the first part.
[96:56.55]I just hit my teeth with this shit.
[96:59.81]That fucking hurt.
[97:00.56]After this, we're going to play Cuphead.
[97:12.60]After that night, I did a lot of bad stuff and ended up in prison.
[97:16.89]But I served my time without protesting.
[97:19.43]I'm out now.
[97:20.75]Just eat food on stream.
[97:22.41]I thought that was a person in the room for a second.
[97:28.57]I was like, what the fuck?
[97:30.91]Life is strange?
[97:31.87]No, this is obscure too.
[97:41.39]Look at that, just in time.
[97:46.19]Have a seat, we got a game here.
[97:47.47]Did you make a sandwich?
[97:55.32]It's a macaron.
[97:57.30]Oh.
[97:57.38]All right, let's go.
[98:01.76]Just put the whole thing in your mouth and go.
[98:04.00]Give me my camera.
[98:04.88]We can keep it taped later, man.
[98:07.25]I don't want to see you on it.
[98:10.81]Not even in the game.
[98:12.23]You're following me around.
[98:14.73]No, not another walk-around simulator.
[98:16.19]Come on.
[98:20.74]I can't move out of the way.
[98:21.54]You have to get up.
[98:21.98]No, I can't.
[98:22.38]I'm good.
[98:25.52]There's no point.
[98:26.08]Player two is leaving the game.
[98:27.18]No, no, no.
[98:27.48]I'm trying to join the game.
[98:28.56]Just walk around.
[98:29.14]You're good.
[98:30.34]But if it walks around for me, then like... It's not going to walk around for you.
[98:33.60]Why is it so loud?
[98:34.69]I don't know.
[98:36.59]Because the game is loud.
[98:39.73]We're going to find Sven.
[98:44.15]I'm not even in this game.
[98:45.99]I already know where we're going.
[98:47.99]Wow, it's a party.
[98:51.07]We're ready.
[98:53.05]Why would you smell that?
[98:55.27]Don't smell that.
[98:56.10]Wow.
[98:57.56]Wow.
[98:58.40]Why?
[98:58.96]That's not the reaction.
[99:00.00]That's what she was doing.
[99:00.90]Don't do that.
[99:01.50]She was just doing it.
[99:09.38]What are you doing?
[99:12.88]Get out of there.
[99:13.78]So you just inhale flowers.
[99:15.60]Fan.
[99:15.92]If you're with me, it won't be an issue.
[99:23.18]You gotta relax.
[99:26.40]It's just Vicks VapoRub.
[99:27.64]Don't worry about it.
[99:33.93]Did you eat like a crack sandwich upstairs?
[99:38.14]Alright, here we go.
[99:39.98]You're not here.
[99:40.40]Too bad you don't get... You're not leaving the game.
[99:44.63]You're not here yet.
[99:46.67]Got a baseball bat.
[99:47.49]Just like in the first game.
[99:51.01]Just like in the first game.
[99:52.79]Oh, here I am.
[99:53.51]We're good.
[99:58.60]It's a very elaborate trick.
[100:01.32]How do I attack?
[100:01.92]There we go.
[100:04.54]Again, you get the bat.
[100:06.02]What do I get?
[100:09.80]All right, it's L1 and R1.
[100:13.28]That's way more brutal than the first game.
[100:14.51]All right, let's go, come on.
[100:15.65]Now we're in Silent Hill.
[100:19.49]I'm like the observer.
[100:21.63]There's a guy right there that's an actual guy.
[100:23.47]There is a guy walking around with a sack.
[100:26.89]Go get him.
[100:27.69]There's a girl in there.
[100:28.31]I can't.
[100:28.47]There's mannequins in the way.
[100:29.53]We gotta go down.
[100:30.09]Hey!
[100:30.39]Stop!
[100:31.13]Hey!
[100:32.63]Crap!
[100:33.53]Crap, guys.
[100:34.59]He's got away.
[100:35.47]That sounded like a South Park character.
[100:38.19]That was like Matt Stone.
[100:40.29]See?
[100:40.47]Remember I told you about holding the flashlight?
[100:42.19]All right.
[100:42.60]You have a flashlight, too, though.
[100:44.20]You have to just make sure I can see what I'm doing.
[100:47.32]See?
[100:48.06]Oh, we're having flashbacks.
[100:49.86]We've been here before.
[100:50.64]Just walk forward.
[100:53.50]I'm queued up and ready to blast.
[100:54.82]Lost.
[100:57.37]What's going on?
[100:58.03]My FOV's like 45.
[100:58.89]I'm the one with the weapon.
[101:00.09]You gotta slow down.
[101:01.75]I'm good.
[101:03.21]We're good.
[101:04.15]We're there.
[101:04.57]No guns?
[101:07.39]Watch out.
[101:08.21]Scary.
[101:08.83]Monster.
[101:09.73]Got her.
[101:10.21]This game would have been scary in 2004.
[101:12.71]Watch this.
[101:13.31]Got him.
[101:28.93]Don't move the camera like that.
[101:30.91]That hurts my brain.
[101:34.16]I didn't mean to.
[101:36.31]This time, I got a gun.
[101:37.37]Alright, you have the shotgun.
[101:39.47]What is this?
[101:40.31]Is this a shotgun on the ground?
[101:41.62]Can you get that?
[101:42.38]It's just a wood plank.
[101:43.50]I can't get rid of her.
[102:05.66]We're gonna do a good, like, Dark Souls song.
[102:08.72]Oh, this is her.
[102:10.34]Oh.
[102:11.32]You killed her.
[102:12.36]I didn't do that, actually.
[102:13.82]You shot her twice.
[102:14.62]Alright, here we go.
[102:15.37]First... Watch out, watch out.
[102:18.23]What are you doing with the camera?
[102:19.29]I'm not moving the camera.
[102:20.81]The camera's moving itself.
[102:23.59]I'm not touching the camera.
[102:25.27]Are you sure about that?
[102:27.83]I'm not touching it, I swear.
[102:30.39]Back it up, back it up.
[102:31.49]Back it up, back it up.
[102:36.75]It's okay, I got the bug.
[102:39.56]I can handle the, what?
[102:40.72]How did you get over here?
[102:42.04]How did I get over here?
[102:44.90]Why are we in the bathroom now?
[102:46.72]That was just a bad dream.
[102:50.85]That was just a bad trip, man.
[102:52.43]You shouldn't have sniffed that drug that that guy told you to sniff.
[102:56.69]Oh, this sucks.
[103:00.54]That's what it is.
[103:01.22]It's like you sniffed the drug.
[103:02.92]It got fucked up.
[103:04.43]You got secondhand smoke.
[103:05.99]Yeah, just like in the fucking first game.
[103:08.37]We saw the same exact scenario play out.
[103:10.47]Yeah, they just copied the first game where you cannot win and you're supposed to die and then you spend the next 45 minutes trying to lock and unlock doors.
[103:22.28]They're all locked.
[103:23.69]I guarantee it.
[103:24.41]They're all locked.
[103:25.83]Everyone.
[103:26.39]This is the local co-op stream.
[103:28.01]The door is blocked off.
[103:29.51]Can I take the fire extinguisher?
[103:30.69]It's scripted.
[103:33.97]Don't do drugs.
[103:37.34]There you go.
[103:38.16]There you go.
[103:39.26]Good job.
[103:40.70]We're getting close to finding me in the dungeon again below the...
[103:45.18]Why would you just drink one of those?
[103:46.70]Who put that there?
[103:48.12]Cheers to that.
[103:48.98]That's much better.
[103:50.32]That's much better.
[103:52.06]Cheers to that.
[103:52.60]Look at the music's back on too.
[103:56.91]Hey.
[103:57.57]Oh, yeah.
[103:59.17]Cheers.
[103:59.63]Hang on.
[104:02.13]Cheers to that.
[104:04.51]What are you doing?
[104:05.23]Oh, my God.
[104:05.74]What the fuck are you thinking?
[104:08.14]why would you do that oh my god that's disgusting you are rancid you are rancid that was not that was not hey welcome to the stream guys uh oh my god that was vile
[104:39.18]Welcome to Massachusetts.
[104:43.54]The music did not make that any better.
[104:45.62]What are you thinking?
[104:49.66]He's lost it.
[104:51.71]What am I doing?
[104:52.25]Why am I doing this?
[104:54.93]Unnecessary.
[104:57.71]This is so unnecessary.
[105:00.63]Can I just go through a door?
[105:01.69]Please don't have nudity in this game.
[105:08.47]What am I doing?
[105:14.40]What am I doing?
[105:15.30]I don't know.
[105:16.22]That's the question.
[105:16.80]You just drank a Lunchables that was in my mouth.
[105:19.94]Oh, yeah.
[105:21.08]I forgot about that part.
[105:22.76]You forgot about that part.
[105:24.80]It's okay.
[105:25.62]My immune system is really strong.
[105:28.95]What am I doing?
[105:29.69]There's cheese stuck in my teeth.
[105:32.53]Where am I?
[105:33.17]Did you just headbutt that door?
[105:37.64]I don't know what's even happening here.
[105:43.68]We're about to do drugs again?
[105:44.74]It's okay, guys.
[105:45.78]It's been like 30 minutes.
[105:46.76]It dried out.
[105:47.19]Apparently.
[105:47.47]Come on.
[105:47.83]Come on.
[105:48.27]Let's go.
[105:48.53]I'm here.
[105:48.77]Let me drink that energy drink.
[105:50.11]You're just a friend.
[106:07.61]You're not a guy.
[106:08.45]You're just a friend.
[106:09.73]What kind of party is this?
[106:10.59]Yeah, are you sure this is a party and not a haunted house?
[106:13.67]That's what the outside of a haunted house looks like.
[106:15.23]What's the password?
[106:18.83]It's like a Tony Hawk character.
[106:23.97]You open it.
[106:24.37]All right.
[106:25.37]I'm sure May could hack that.
[106:27.75]You walk away.
[106:28.21]All right, so now you try and open it.
[106:39.54]Wow.
[106:40.38]All right, come this way.
[106:41.52]How dare... First of all, how dare you?
[106:45.00]Can we go on the other side?
[106:47.03]We can.
[106:47.41]Come with me.
[106:48.49]Follow me.
[106:51.45]I'm just going to take the secret entrance.
[106:53.99]We've got to get in the party of the century.
[106:56.35]I'll take a golf club.
[106:57.89]I will take a golf club for sure.
[107:00.80]Mine.
[107:01.14]Give it to me.
[107:01.46]Mine.
[107:02.26]Give it to me.
[107:03.42]Got it.
[107:03.78]Maybe this will change that bouncer's mind.
[107:06.26]Don't be impulsive.
[107:08.15]Alright.
[107:09.00]Don't you dare.
[107:10.74]How does getting a hockey stick make you in?
[107:15.94]Let's go.
[107:18.18]Okay.
[107:24.40]How do I get in there?
[107:26.33]Do you try opening that door?
[107:29.07]Every door is locked in these games.
[107:30.21]Alright, so when the guy opens the door and tells us to go away, you hit him with the golf club.
[107:33.51]I have to smash him with the golf club.
[107:34.67]Okay.
[107:35.79]Makes sense.
[107:41.90]Like, this is a bunch of money came into.
[107:43.66]Before we play Cuphead, we're going to have to take a look at this.
[107:46.06]This camera is moving around.
[107:48.79]Okay, let's try it.
[107:49.37]Let's see if I can, like, intimidate him.
[107:51.13]Go sweat somewhere else, big guy.
[107:54.25]Apparently not.
[107:54.85]The front door.
[107:55.67]Let's try the front.
[107:58.51]The locked door video game sequel.
[108:01.88]It's all right.
[108:03.00]Go back this way.
[108:05.44]Cuphead.
[108:06.80]Cuphead.
[108:07.38]Cuphead.
[108:09.85]Five minutes.
[108:10.77]Give us five minutes.
[108:11.79]I spent like $170 on these games.
[108:13.57]It was not cheap.
[108:17.99]That's true.
[108:18.41]This is true.
[108:19.25]Just let us have our fucking dumb shit fun for like 10 more minutes.
[108:22.45]This wasn't like a free demo on Steam.
[108:24.15]This isn't a free demo.
[108:25.45]This game is $10.
[108:25.97]That you could just uninstall.
[108:29.01]Come over here.
[108:30.85]Can I like boost you up here?
[108:31.53]Okay, climb up on the roof.
[108:32.63]Okay, so I can boost you up here?
[108:33.62]Yes.
[108:34.30]How?
[108:36.02]Probably like a... That's not how you do it.
[108:38.38]That's not how you do it, no.
[108:40.22]Is that a pullable object you can pull over here?
[108:42.92]Yes, it is.
[108:43.70]I can't do it.
[108:45.14]I'm just a weak girl.
[108:46.46]Yeah, sure.
[108:48.24]I'm just a weak girl, guys.
[108:51.32]Whatever you say.
[108:51.96]No, I'm helping.
[108:52.72]I'm helping right now.
[108:59.88]These two have clearly issues that they need to work out with.
[109:02.87]There's a mutual attraction here that's going unsaid.
[109:05.35]This guy is pretty strong.
[109:07.45]That's got to be at least a two-ton metal crate that you're pulling along right now.
[109:10.93]Probably.
[109:11.25]All right, we're good.
[109:13.31]I think we can get up there now, right?
[109:17.99]Together.
[109:18.41]Can I do that too?
[109:20.11]No, I'm strong now.
[109:21.93]Just wait for me.
[109:22.57]We're going to be out of this game in like five minutes.
[109:26.33]Stop it.
[109:26.85]I can't even see what I'm just... Well, why don't you go ahead and play the game?
[109:33.15]You've been playing this entire time.
[109:34.89]All right, so do something.
[109:36.77]I'm trying.
[109:37.59]Why don't you read bits or something while I play the game?
[109:40.43]All right.
[109:41.93]It's not a bad idea.
[109:42.71]Oh, God.
[109:45.29]Fuck.
[109:45.65]Whoops.
[109:46.93]Oh, God damn it.
[109:47.53]All right.
[109:48.73]Hey, Frill... Oh, my Lord.
[109:51.67]Frillity, you need me.
[109:53.43]Yep, you do.
[109:54.35]Frility, thanks for the $50.
[109:55.13]I do.
[109:56.97]Cheers to that.
[109:57.51]Thank you, Frility.
[109:59.11]I can't see where I am.
[110:00.27]You have to come back so I can see what I'm doing.
[110:02.72]But thank you so much, Frility, for the $50.
[110:04.42]Cheers to that.
[110:04.96]Sure, here you go.
[110:05.96]Cheers to that.
[110:06.98]That joke's already over.
[110:09.96]I think I put the cap on it.
[110:11.78]Where the fuck is my character?
[110:13.72]I don't know where your character is.
[110:15.10]There he is.
[110:18.64]Also, thank you to Hot Wings.
[110:22.86]Thank you, Hot Wings, for the 10 bucks.
[110:27.01]Am I Kenny?
[110:28.05]Get out of the way.
[110:30.79]No, we had to both open the door.
[110:32.27]No, I got it.
[110:33.71]How come I can't open the window, but you can?
[110:35.77]Because I'm Kenny.
[110:36.93]Look at these.
[110:37.27]This is just Vampire Masquerade.
[110:38.65]It's a window.
[110:39.48]Vampire the Masquerade Ball.
[110:40.52]That's how they're dancing in there.
[110:42.36]But thank you, Hot Wings, for the 10 bucks.
[110:43.70]Hey, Jerma, brave of you to stream your date with Italics.
[110:46.20]A lot of emotion in the air.
[110:47.16]You think he's the one.
[110:51.42]Show him the ring.
[110:52.52]Definitely not.
[110:54.36]Thank you to... Thank you to Juj... Juj... Juj Rotor.
[111:00.51]Oh, Juj Rotor.
[111:01.17]Thanks for the $1.
[111:02.03]Read bits, you filthy heretic.
[111:05.23]What is this mess?
[111:07.29]Thank you to Zahner for the $5.
[111:09.77]Not like this.
[111:10.51]Get a donation link, please.
[111:12.37]By the way, love you too.
[111:13.33]Not like this.
[111:13.97]Not like this.
[111:14.53]Not like this.
[111:15.03]What do you mean not like this?
[111:15.84]What happened?
[111:17.64]And I will take the golf club as well.
[111:19.90]How do you equip it?
[111:21.64]No, I don't want to leave the game.
[111:23.18]Seize.
[111:24.74]I got it.
[111:28.67]You just took that from me.
[111:30.41]I need a weapon!
[111:31.67]Any guns?
[111:33.55]But thank you, though, Zahner.
[111:35.77]Thank you also to Eves for the 50 bucks earlier.
[111:38.78]And Eves says...
[111:42.73]Seen some big donations.
[111:43.96]I've had little money lately, so here's to my two favorite streamers.
[111:47.86]Love you in italics and German.
[111:50.64]You guys make my night 20 fucking billion times better.
[111:52.86]Well, thank you, Yves.
[111:54.06]Thank you so much, man.
[111:54.88]20 billion is a big number.
[111:56.30]That's a fucking large number, man.
[111:58.56]That was very, very... That was rage.
[112:02.55]Pure, unadulterated rage.
[112:04.21]You better take a look, Amy.
[112:05.37]You look at it.
[112:05.79]You have, like, the fucking computer.
[112:09.13]Hey.
[112:10.40]Here's to that.
[112:11.11]Cheers to that.
[112:11.65]No, here's to that.
[112:12.37]No, here's to that.
[112:13.95]Do you want any of this?
[112:15.29]I'm good.
[112:15.73]Here's to that.
[112:17.03]I don't like... Do you want it plain?
[112:19.13]Gun.
[112:19.37]Gun.
[112:19.71]Gun.
[112:20.71]Where is it?
[112:21.30]Gun.
[112:21.48]Gun.
[112:21.82]That is not a gun.
[112:24.10]Gun.
[112:24.24]Gun.
[112:36.84]It's my turn.
[112:37.88]It's been like two hours and it's my turn.
[112:40.50]Get the gun.
[112:41.06]It's in here.
[112:41.36]Where is it?
[112:41.72]Right here.
[112:43.24]That's a gun?
[112:43.98]Gun.
[112:44.70]No, it's a fire extinguisher.
[112:45.60]It's a spray gun.
[112:46.14]All right, back here.
[112:47.46]What did I ever do to you?
[112:49.28]No.
[112:49.78]It's blocked off.
[112:51.28]It's not back here.
[112:53.70]Gun.
[112:55.78]Smash it.
[112:58.72]Gun.
[113:00.12]Who gets the gun?
[113:01.78]I don't care.
[113:02.82]You can have the gun.
[113:05.85]Look, look, look.
[113:10.89]Why does it say look?
[113:12.43]Back here.
[113:12.69]Back here, there's like a Tron cabinet back here.
[113:16.32]I want to play like the video game.
[113:19.08]Look, look.
[113:20.22]Awesome alcohol collection.
[113:21.28]What did I ever do to you?
[113:22.44]All right, we got a touch.
[113:25.92]Do you really want to touch the flower?
[113:27.20]Sure.
[113:30.02]Okay, make it.
[113:34.03]Oh, it's a save point.
[113:35.75]It's a save.
[113:36.31]Relax.
[113:36.83]It's a save point.
[113:38.17]It's just a save point.
[113:39.19]Everybody calm down.
[113:39.89]I thought it was going to be a game over.
[113:42.46]There's a save here.
[113:47.42]I have no idea what that is.
[113:51.46]We're already further in this game than we were the last game.
[113:55.60]That is true.
[113:56.12]Is there a gun in here?
[114:00.39]We just walked across the whole room.
[114:03.17]Well, she said there was a gun in the billiards room.
[114:05.47]Did she?
[114:07.73]Yes!
[114:09.09]Well, where is it?
[114:10.21]It's got to be behind the bar.
[114:12.02]You know, you ever seen that Simon Pegg movie where they get the gun behind the bar and they're like, we're going to wait until all this blows over.
[114:18.46]Remember that funny joke?
[114:19.28]I don't even know who Simon Pegg is.
[114:21.72]Who's Simon Pegg?
[114:24.04]The gun's probably in the safe.
[114:24.91]We need to figure out what the code is.
[114:28.19]There's more doors.
[114:32.71]somebody look it up all right look it up somebody like yeah I don't I don't care what is it cigarette spaghetti again gave 50 bucks again wow you are a lot of money music I've met music in real life it wasn't looking into a mirror it was like looking into the eyes of someone who wished they could be as good looking as this cheers to this no it's cheers to that
[114:57.36]No, it says cheers to this.
[114:58.90]That's what the comment says.
[115:00.00]5, 3, 7, 8.
[115:00.60]You got it.
[115:01.06]There's a quotation mark, so it was actually cheers to that.
[115:03.44]That's not the right fucking combination.
[115:05.84]3, 4, 5, 2.
[115:06.67]You're not going to find out.
[115:12.23]4, 7, 4, 2.
[115:12.53]It would be faster for me to look up the code.
[115:14.89]Look it up.
[115:15.27]Quick.
[115:15.65]Let's see who gets it first.
[115:16.35]5, 2, 1, 3.
[115:21.81]You're against the clock.
[115:22.57]Go, go, go.
[115:23.11]What's the name of this game?
[115:25.03]Absolver?
[115:25.63]Observer?
[115:26.73]Obscure 2.
[115:27.49]1, 1, 2, 2.
[115:29.40]Obscure 2.
[115:30.46]No, that's not it.
[115:31.66]6, 9, 6, 9.
[115:32.64]Of course that's not it.
[115:33.50]What the fuck would I even put that in for?
[115:34.64]1, 8, 7, 3.
[115:37.05]I found a game fact from 2007.
[115:38.75]You were too fucking slow.
[115:40.63]What was it?
[115:43.11]Did somebody really give you the right code?
[115:44.59]I just tried them all until I found one.
[115:46.45]It's the correct code.
[115:48.72]Oh, boy.
[115:49.04]All right, I got the gun.
[115:53.82]I'm ready to go.
[115:54.28]All right, so let's go talk to the lady.
[116:00.80]I get the gun.
[116:01.26]Okay, here I go.
[116:03.37]Okay.
[116:05.63]Should I shoot him or should you try to take... How do I shoot the gun?
[116:13.88]Alright, you... What did she say?
[116:21.36]What did she say?
[116:24.45]Why are you even over here?
[116:25.55]I did it.
[116:27.17]Stop hitting me.
[116:28.93]I beat it.
[116:30.35]Cigarettes, we're going to give another 100.
[116:35.90]There was a lot to take in there.
[116:40.66]There was a lot to take in there.
[116:41.92]Don't tell me what I wrote italics.
[116:43.96]I typed it.
[116:44.58]I know what it said.
[116:45.54]Cheers to that.
[116:46.58]Cheers to that.
[116:48.31]Cheers to that.
[116:50.33]Don't, I'm getting that away from you.
[116:51.61]You're not taking that.
[116:53.13]There's nothing else in there.
[116:54.87]It's empty.
[116:55.43]I just drank it.
[116:56.99]Downstairs?
[117:01.66]But thank you, cigarette spaghetti.
[117:03.66]Holy fuck.
[117:04.14]Why is our heart rate like pounding right now?
[117:06.78]Yeah, we were, okay, this is what happens when you sprint a full sprint for like 55 minutes.
[117:12.45]Wait, is there something on the monster?
[117:15.04]Okay, there's a Brotherhood key.
[117:17.40]Easy.
[117:18.06]You can access the object menu by pressing LT.
[117:21.38]So pull out the key.
[117:23.70]Key to the Brotherhood shelf.
[117:25.12]This is like a dog heartbeat.
[117:27.24]Where is the Brotherhood shelf?
[117:29.36]Brotherhood shelf seems like it would be over here.
[117:30.95]There's a shelf, right?
[117:35.46]Seems like a shelf.
[117:37.38]Uh, no.
[117:37.80]Brotherhood shelf?
[117:38.26]Pack into this electronics shop.
[117:40.02]Blocked off.
[117:42.30]Did you find it?
[117:43.06]I don't know.
[117:44.25]Brotherhood of sheep.
[117:45.19]But, cigarette man, you are way too kind.
[117:48.63]Brotherhood shelf.
[117:49.29]It's gotta be one of these things.
[117:50.67]This looks like a shelf.
[117:51.91]Give a boost.
[117:52.71]Get up there and get it.
[117:53.57]I'm going.
[117:54.63]Take that.
[117:55.45]Small key.
[117:55.89]Another, we have like three keys now.
[117:59.19]I need, oh, fuck.
[117:59.99]Oh, fuck, dude.
[118:02.83]I gotta go get italics at the airport.
[118:06.36]What time is it?
[118:07.46]It's late.
[118:08.96]How long has he been there for?
[118:12.23]It's 9.30 Eastern.
[118:14.59]He's probably been there since yesterday.
[118:15.79]Yeah.
[118:19.07]Probably is.
[118:20.01]When do you think he came in?
[118:21.77]That's italics!
[118:22.87]You guys are fucking funny.
[118:24.67]Alright, let's go to Brotherhood Shelf.
[118:28.67]Whoops.
[118:30.66]Alright.
[118:32.38]I can't wait to just fucking destroy it.
[118:34.08]Inspect it.
[118:34.60]Hit Y.
[118:38.81]1-8-7-3.
[118:39.13]That's the code.
[118:42.36]That's the code.
[118:43.90]We went backwards.
[118:44.84]That's the gun code.
[118:45.84]That's the gun code.
[118:46.66]Okay.
[118:47.84]Happy birthday, Nicholas.
[118:48.68]Hope you're watching.
[118:51.30]Door's locked.
[118:51.76]What about object?
[118:52.76]That's telling us to open up the object menu.
[118:55.30]Brotherhood shelf.
[118:56.24]Use.
[118:57.06]Oh, you have to select use.
[118:58.50]He's got such a good gamer sense.
[118:59.64]All right, guys.
[119:00.18]Not me.
[119:00.54]Let's go down.
[119:05.25]Back in 2005.
[119:06.17]I don't even think about starting that.
[119:08.36]Bloodbath?
[119:08.98]Alright.
[119:12.86]Why did we both have the same idea?
[119:14.66]We're terrible fucking people.
[119:18.06]This way?
[119:18.52]Give me that clip.
[119:19.83]That's mine.
[119:22.79]Resume control.
[119:23.75]Where's your clip?
[119:25.17]It's in the gun.
[119:26.05]Automatically.
[119:26.73]You already have it.
[119:28.05]You very needy person.
[119:30.13]I am pretty needy.
[119:30.91]I actually am very needy.
[119:34.25]This way?
[119:35.29]We came from there.
[119:38.10]Bad guy.
[119:38.62]No, just a jump scare.
[119:42.28]I can do that too.
[119:44.20]You can pick up chairs.
[119:45.30]You can?
[119:46.10]That just made this game twice as good as it was before.
[119:48.18]It really made the game much better.
[119:50.24]Where's another chair, though?
[119:51.22]I think we have to... So sassy.
[119:53.77]Oh, shit, I have to...
[119:58.39]We have to move these things.
[119:59.65]I'm too weak to push bookshelves.
[120:02.21]Just wait.
[120:02.53]Just figure it out for me.
[120:03.22]Don't worry.
[120:04.30]I got the... Look at the headcrabs, please.
[120:06.76]There's one on my face.
[120:07.72]There's one on me, too.
[120:08.58]Hit A. I have to struggle.
[120:11.20]I gotta struggle.
[120:12.40]Where am I?
[120:12.90]I'm holding onto the bookcase still.
[120:18.37]I'm pretty sure it already planted eggs in my mouth.
[120:21.05]This is a waste of ammo.
[120:21.73]You have to do this.
[120:24.10]All right, so I got, how do we know what direction it is?
[120:27.40]What the correct direction is?
[120:33.09]This one has to move down.
[120:33.79]There's just a guy screaming in the background.
[120:40.91]One of the bookshelves is more important than the others, right?
[120:43.36]We got different symbols on top.
[120:44.74]There's one with an I, there's one with like an upside down L. I'm stuck inside of the bookshelf.
[120:49.70]Just move.
[120:51.17]I'm going to say it's probably... This one's got a triangle.
[120:52.81]I bet the code is like somewhere around here.
[120:55.72]There's only a few different possible... There's like at least six.
[120:59.62]No, there's not.
[120:59.94]There's three.
[121:00.92]Possibilities.
[121:01.38]There's only three possibilities.
[121:02.72]It's either top left, bottom, top right, or it's... Yeah, what sorority are we in?
[121:10.79]This is alpha, this is alpha, kappa, kappa.
[121:13.33]You know what I mean?
[121:13.83]Like for Twitch.
[121:17.30]All right, you keep doing that, I'm gonna look around.
[121:20.62]Yeah, we're in a cappa cappa cappa for Twitch.tv.
[121:28.91]There's definitely like a clue somewhere.
[121:38.62]Yeah, you have no idea.
[121:39.72]Does Jeremiah think he's funny?
[121:42.65]No.
[121:43.53]Yes.
[121:43.83]In fact, the complete opposite.
[121:45.87]I don't.
[121:46.27]He doesn't think.
[121:47.05]I don't think that.
[121:47.63]He knows.
[121:48.48]I'm sorry.
[121:49.64]That was fucking terrible.
[121:52.67]I think he's funny.
[121:53.77]You know what?
[121:54.11]Just fucking get rid of that guy.
[121:55.93]That guy needs to get permanently banned.
[121:58.19]I can't do anything right now.
[122:00.24]Respect the streamer.
[122:01.24]My ego is so important to me.
[122:03.80]I'm too weak.
[122:05.40]I have an energy drink.
[122:06.18]You only say that I'm fucking funny and smart and handsome and gifted.
[122:12.11]Otherwise...
[122:17.86]Does anyone want to look this up?
[122:19.51]Is anyone looking this up yet?
[122:21.03]Is anyone looking this up yet?
[122:22.51]Where does it go?
[122:25.91]Dock left?
[122:26.59]Bottom?
[122:27.25]Right?
[122:29.93]And I'm balding.
[122:30.61]Get rid of that guy too.
[122:32.78]I want him gone forever.
[122:33.44]Creaks?
[122:36.04]Triangle O-L.
[122:38.08]Okay, but what direction?
[122:38.88]Triangle O-L?
[122:40.56]Got it.
[122:42.58]Delta Theta.
[122:44.61]I don't know.
[122:44.91]This is like a Greek language.
[122:46.39]This is like a Roman numerals.
[122:48.57]I don't know Roman numerals.
[122:52.35]This is Roman numerals.
[122:54.55]Who put bookshelves on a moving metal track anyway?
[122:58.94]Get out.
[123:00.92]No, I can't do anything.
[123:02.54]I just run around and wait for the puzzle to be solved because I'm a dumb girl.
[123:07.12]Just move out of the way.
[123:09.47]I'm not in the way.
[123:10.45]This is Roman numerals.
[123:12.29]How many Bitcoin do you have?
[123:20.83]Why would that matter?
[123:22.43]Like, that's a big deal.
[123:23.85]How many Bitcoin do you even have?
[123:25.19]How many BTC?
[123:26.47]You see what happened last night?
[123:29.92]Roman numerals are not Greek letters.
[123:31.76]Get that guy out of here forever.
[123:36.12]I need to move this out of the way.
[123:38.54]Fourth Bitcoin joke and count.
[123:43.06]and counting.
[123:44.36]God damn it, man.
[123:46.62]Can I please?
[123:47.72]8% bitcoins.
[123:49.74]I'm getting paid in 8% bitcoins.
[123:51.58]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[123:52.74]Okay.
[123:53.90]Watch this.
[123:54.16]Ready?
[123:55.20]Alpha.
[123:57.28]Omega.
[123:58.02]Omega penta.
[123:59.42]Right?
[124:00.02]Omega alpha penta.
[124:03.48]They gotta be together like this.
[124:09.18]Come on!
[124:12.33]Uh, this is about the part where we go to the next game.
[124:18.19]It's about that part.
[124:19.09]But what is it?
[124:19.63]Come on.
[124:20.89]A-O-L.
[124:23.87]But what... Fucking goddammit.
[124:37.36]How long did we make it?
[124:38.12]30 minutes?
[124:38.82]Doesn't matter.
[124:47.19]Hold on a minute.
[124:49.28]Why don't we find out how smart italics is?
[124:51.58]Oh, no.
[124:54.24]We could find that out.
[124:59.50]What do you think?
[125:02.82]Do like a IQ test.
[125:06.27]Give him a quick little IQ test.
[125:07.55]What do you think?
[125:10.89]Whether or not I watch?
[125:12.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[125:14.38]I've done this.
[125:15.90]That's fucking stupid.
[125:18.16]We're going to play Cuphead.
[125:18.98]I was going to have you play Zoombinis.
[125:25.34]Hold on.
[125:26.22]One sec.
[125:37.37]This is so low, by the way.
[125:42.98]All right, let me turn this up.
[125:44.32]Do it.
[125:45.34]Do what?
[125:45.94]That's what they're saying.
[125:46.76]They're saying Zumbini.
[125:47.59]They're all doing Zumbinis.
[125:50.07]I just don't think you're going to be smart enough for it.
[125:52.63]I mean, that's possible.
[125:53.45]Did you have to ask chat to solve the puzzles for you, like in this game?
[125:57.09]No.
[125:58.21]Like in this game, me.
[125:59.11]Cuphead.
[125:59.93]Hold on a minute.
[126:00.94]Let's be real here.
[126:01.78]Metallics.
[126:04.62]Yeah, it's probably pretty easy to pass the game.
[126:07.02]How many deaths did you have in Cuphead?
[126:10.22]I don't know.
[126:11.22]Was it more than 113?
[126:13.81]Maybe.
[126:16.39]Maybe.
[126:19.69]How many deaths did you have at the alligator?
[126:22.66]The alligator?
[126:23.74]Which one's the alligator?
[126:25.74]The serpent with the three heads.
[126:28.36]How many did you have with the bee?
[126:31.36]Five.
[126:34.44]We're going to see who the real fucking gamer here is, by the way.
[126:39.64]Why is it so low?
[126:42.24]Is this like super low for some reason?
[126:45.08]Okay, that's better.
[126:47.58]All right.
[126:49.02]We're gonna find out who the real gamer is.
[126:51.10]Should we start a new game together?
[126:54.28]Then we can't play on Expert.
[126:55.48]That's right, that's right.
[126:56.59]I'll show him how it fucking works on Expert.
[127:01.70]Might be a little drunk.
[127:06.40]There you go.
[127:08.39]There you go.
[127:12.43]IRL streak.
[127:13.81]Booze run.
[127:14.41]Okay, we got charge.
[127:15.77]How do you play?
[127:16.45]What do you do here?
[127:19.03]Player two has joined.
[127:19.97]I'm in.
[127:20.97]Let me change this to actual Cuphead because this is an actual video game.
[127:27.01]Not like a fucking piece of shit.
[127:29.66]By the way, hey, welcome to the stream, guys.
[127:31.10]It only took us like two and a half hours to get to a video game.
[127:34.30]We're like eating Lunchables and fucking drinking.
[127:37.14]Sometimes twice.
[127:38.06]Sometimes fucking twice.
[127:44.68]So you want to put some steaks here?
[127:45.96]What do you think?
[127:49.68]Like a bet?
[127:50.96]Like if I do more damage and do way better than you, then I get to drink.
[127:54.14]Isn't it supposed to be the opposite?
[127:57.36]Yeah.
[127:57.76]Wait, hold on.
[128:00.97]I don't remember.
[128:02.56]Let's turn that down a little bit just so it's not so loud.
[128:04.52]Alright, it should say Cuphead.
[128:06.24]We should have a local cop friend sesh.
[128:07.92]That's fine.
[128:09.62]Everything's fine.
[128:10.22]Alright, we're playing for all the bits.
[128:14.24]All the bits?
[128:14.76]We're playing for all the bits.
[128:16.81]You want to play for like two grand?
[128:20.05]Okay.
[128:21.34]For all the bits tonight, we're going to play for all the bits tonight.
[128:23.24]If you die, whoever dies, you know, let's just fucking go right off the bat right now.
[128:28.79]Botanic Panic, expert, you take one damage, I get every bit.
[128:33.47]I take one point of damage, you get every single fucking bit.
[128:37.79]Cheers to that.
[128:39.07]Cheers to that.
[128:41.07]I don't lose anything if I lose.
[128:42.79]I forget how to play.
[128:43.97]I don't know either.
[128:46.07]See, I played with an Xbox 360 controller.
[128:48.65]How do you even shoot?
[128:52.76]Give me the bets.
[128:54.02]I'll take every single bet.
[128:55.52]It's not the first hit.
[128:57.68]Whoever does the most damage.
[128:59.78]Whoever does the most damage.
[129:01.60]One, two, three, four.
[129:06.16]Oh, baby, that's you.
[129:07.51]Just transferred back to him.
[129:09.07]Now he gets the bets.
[129:10.81]You just exited the game.
[129:11.87]We're going to refresh.
[129:12.81]Everything's even.
[129:13.53]I don't know how to shoot.
[129:14.83]Everything's even.
[129:15.33]Okay, let's go back.
[129:15.99]What's the shoot button?
[129:17.03]Expert.
[129:17.37]Here we go.
[129:17.79]Three, two, one, action.
[129:19.27]We're back to even.
[129:20.35]Zero to zero.
[129:20.91]Okay.
[129:23.75]How do you shoot?
[129:30.24]How do you shoot?
[129:35.33]He got hit.
[129:36.73]You got hit first?
[129:37.49]He's got the bits.
[129:42.96]I don't know how to shoot.
[129:43.98]Just tell me the button.
[129:44.80]Fucking X, dude.
[129:46.16]Square.
[129:46.90]Square.
[129:47.50]Thank you.
[129:47.80]I'm playing with an Xbox.
[129:49.85]Will you shoot him?
[129:51.09]I'm shooting.
[129:52.17]You got twice the best.
[129:53.17]I owe you $6,000.
[129:53.95]All right.
[129:54.37]I'm helping.
[129:55.39]I'm helping.
[130:02.91]I got back three grand.
[130:04.14]I get three grand now.
[130:07.30]So now I owe you $3,000.
[130:21.51]It's happening.
[130:23.81]He's dead.
[130:24.81]I could beat the whole boss by myself.
[130:27.65]No, come on.
[130:28.69]Whoops-a-daisy.
[130:29.67]Somebody got hit.
[130:31.85]All right, restart.
[130:33.11]Fucking fresh.
[130:34.41]Here comes who gets all the bits.
[130:35.33]Let's go.
[130:36.79]Something on here?
[130:37.59]Something's on there.
[130:39.21]It's got like some kind of juice on there or something.
[130:41.92]Ooh, somebody got the bits!
[130:43.02]All right, let's fucking beat this guy, please.
[130:50.40]What's the, okay, it's triangle.
[130:53.36]I gotta remember the controls.
[130:54.48]Yeah, I had like a custom control set up for... Don't you know I'm a PC gamer?
[131:00.33]I gotta customize everything.
[131:01.51]All right, you got me hit on that one.
[131:04.47]You got me hit.
[131:05.11]You fucking were moving all over the place like a weirdo.
[131:06.71]You're gonna beat all the bosses on expert if you know that.
[131:13.52]Not if I have to play with triangle to dash.
[131:16.10]Can you please deal with those dashes?
[131:17.76]I have default dashes.
[131:19.02]Why are you over here?
[131:21.99]You shouldn't be over here, right?
[131:23.31]I thought you could walk past him.
[131:26.83]Why is this harder with two people?
[131:28.79]It's way harder.
[131:29.71]You haven't even whacked anything.
[131:37.92]Revive me!
[131:38.69]Thank you.
[131:39.09]Can I?
[131:39.39]How do you revive?
[131:40.17]You double dash.
[131:41.21]Double tap.
[131:41.71]Double tap what?
[131:42.97]You like... do the... thing like you do on pink things.
[131:49.13]How do you hold still?
[131:50.33]You deal with the little things.
[131:51.53]I'll deal with the big guy.
[131:52.33]How do you hold still?
[131:53.14]Small carrots, big carrots.
[131:54.08]I don't know how... I don't know.
[131:55.72]R?
[131:56.20]Right trigger?
[131:56.62]Right?
[131:57.42]L1?
[131:57.56]R1.
[131:57.64]R1, I think.
[132:05.52]Don't be so far.
[132:08.88]I'm gonna get a knockout.
[132:11.69]I missed.
[132:13.53]All right, we got it.
[132:16.07]First boss, down.
[132:17.51]Is it the first boss?
[132:19.17]That is the first boss, yes.
[132:22.31]Let's see who did better.
[132:23.44]I remember how loud this was.
[132:26.30]I wish there was a damage meter.
[132:31.56]We didn't get a single super.
[132:34.59]I don't even know what the Super... Neither do I. It's been like two months since I played this game.
[132:39.58]Me too.
[132:40.52]Down here.
[132:41.58]Let's do the two frogs.
[132:43.52]Expert.
[132:46.28]Did you write in parentheses on the screen title, Expert Mode?
[132:49.00]I didn't.
[132:49.46]That makes us seem way more legitimate than we actually are.
[132:54.08]Right now people are like, hey, they're losing on... Come on, man.
[132:58.40]They're losing on the first boss.
[133:00.86]You can't even handle that shit on Expert?
[133:06.63]I'm getting in my goddamn way.
[133:16.74]Just quiet down, we'll get it.
[133:19.00]Just quiet... Just quiet... Who did that?
[133:21.86]You got in the fucking way.
[133:22.66]You got in the way!
[133:23.50]Revive!
[133:24.18]Revive!
[133:24.46]Do you have a... Oh, you got me killed!
[133:29.76]We're good.
[133:30.89]How many lives do you get?
[133:32.27]It's just... It's like Yoshi's Story.
[133:33.69]Mario 2.
[133:33.99]For Super Nintendo.
[133:34.93]As long as one of you...
[133:40.91]It's money split.
[133:42.11]Money down the middle.
[133:42.93]Money down the middle.
[133:44.61]Right down the middle.
[133:45.37]We need to stay away from each other.
[133:52.17]Start over.
[133:52.57]Hold on.
[133:53.57]Look, we just jumped into this without even remembering.
[133:55.26]We're both drunk.
[133:55.98]We just went into expert mode.
[133:58.10]Expert mode.
[133:58.62]Don't even remember the fucking buttons.
[133:59.74]Of the hardest game.
[134:00.64]Hardest game in the world.
[134:04.00]And?
[134:04.14]It's harder than Dark Souls on stream.
[134:05.60]Harder than Dark Souls on stream.
[134:19.79]When you get hit, it freaks me out and I get hit.
[134:22.10]I did not get hit.
[134:23.12]I thought it was you.
[134:23.92]No, it was you.
[134:28.36]And you deal with the shit in the air.
[134:29.66]What?
[134:31.48]You can make this so much easier on both of us.
[134:39.16]I got it.
[134:39.58]I got it.
[134:41.44]Why are you using default, by the way?
[134:42.62]Any reason?
[134:44.86]Uh, because we started the game before I could customize anything.
[134:48.10]You can't even customize shit.
[134:49.00]Oh, man.
[134:49.28]Oh, man.
[134:49.68]I got you.
[134:51.60]I got you.
[134:53.00]I got you.
[134:53.38]Calm down.
[134:53.78]We're going to Phase 2 here.
[134:56.55]What does he do?
[134:56.95]He'll jump over.
[134:59.79]Watch out.
[135:00.11]He gets tornadoes.
[135:01.13]Shit comes in.
[135:02.65]We're gonna dash, man.
[135:14.88]Drunk head.
[135:16.12]Drunk expert co-op.
[135:17.62]What a fucking disaster.
[135:20.14]The good news is we have all the bosses unlocked.
[135:22.32]That is true.
[135:23.28]So we don't have to stay out anymore.
[135:24.55]I'll take care of the things that... I'll take care of the things that shit in the air.
[135:26.71]You fucking do damage.
[135:31.77]You do damage, I'll take... Alright.
[135:33.77]The bugs in the air.
[135:34.35]Doing DPS.
[135:35.03]You DPS.
[135:40.67]This is much cleaner than before.
[135:42.37]Like a thousand times cleaner.
[135:46.21]There we go.
[135:46.77]Clean.
[135:47.19]Completely clean.
[135:48.31]How do you do super again?
[135:49.11]I forget.
[135:49.51]I don't know.
[135:49.93]I have no clue.
[135:52.33]I actually don't know.
[135:53.09]I just... Okay.
[135:57.34]What the... Remember, it's expert.
[135:59.08]Shit's different.
[136:01.32]I got one... What is super?
[136:02.66]What is super?
[136:03.12]L1, R2, I'm pressing... Okay, it's circle.
[136:04.26]It's circle.
[136:04.72]It's circle.
[136:06.79]You're fucking dead.
[136:08.47]Oh, goddammit, dude.
[136:13.73]Game's hard.
[136:16.29]It's hard.
[136:18.55]We're almost there.
[136:19.23]What are you supposed to do in the second phase?
[136:21.53]It's circle, it's circle.
[136:22.59]Just get it right, get it right.
[136:24.01]What are you supposed to do when he's shooting from one side?
[136:26.81]You're supposed to be good.
[136:31.22]Should've drank a fucking sip.
[136:32.62]You were saying?
[136:33.24]Does this game hurt?
[136:36.28]I'm gonna change this to expert.
[136:38.06]People are gonna think we're fucking idiots.
[136:41.14]Parentheses, expert.
[136:42.54]Cuphead, drunk expert.
[136:45.88]Local co-op.
[136:46.62]No, don't put local co-op.
[136:50.90]Co-op with a dash, I'm proud.
[136:52.76]Co-op... Expert whoops.
[136:54.72]Co-op expert whoops.
[136:56.28]Like, I didn't mean to pick expert.
[136:57.46]Like, whoops!
[136:58.54]Didn't mean to fucking pick expert.
[137:01.62]What a mistake.
[137:03.54]You want to change the controls here?
[137:05.20]Yeah, I do.
[137:06.78]Okay, well, let's get actually prepared.
[137:09.21]This is co-op expert whoops.
[137:13.37]Pure accident.
[137:15.30]Didn't mean to pick this guy up from the airport.
[137:17.16]He just came here.
[137:19.05]3,124 people.
[137:21.27]Hi, guys.
[137:21.71]Hi.
[137:22.39]Hope you're enjoying the stream.
[137:24.29]All right, so let's... Remove player two.
[137:28.19]So what do you want to do?
[137:30.05]I want to change my dash button to a trigger.
[137:35.96]Nothing in here.
[137:38.76]Why am I way drunker than you?
[137:40.18]You are.
[137:40.62]This is not fair.
[137:41.58]I haven't had a single drop of whiskey.
[137:43.56]Controls.
[137:45.85]Player two, select player two.
[137:48.85]But I feel more out of it than you.
[137:51.19]How?
[137:51.75]I don't know.
[137:52.13]It's probably because I hit myself in the head with the cane.
[137:55.04]Yeah, I forgot.
[137:55.56]You like injured your skull.
[137:57.40]All right, dash.
[138:00.82]We want to go, you can't do trigger?
[138:03.12]Hit replace, hit A. What are you doing?
[138:08.55]What's it already in use by?
[138:09.55]Right bumper is already in use.
[138:10.47]Right bumper is standstill.
[138:14.59]Yeah.
[138:15.07]You want standstill to be what?
[138:19.68]Left bumper.
[138:20.20]There's no more whiskey left.
[138:21.52]It's not good.
[138:23.80]There.
[138:24.00]All right.
[138:25.30]Switch weapon is Y. See, I'm okay.
[138:28.20]Left bumper lock, right bumper dash.
[138:29.88]I can handle default controls because I'm not a shitty.
[138:36.07]Guess who beat Cuphead first?
[138:38.27]It was me.
[138:39.13]That's funny.
[138:39.45]Who beat Cuphead first?
[138:40.31]Who didn't stream Cuphead for like three days while you streamed it?
[138:45.47]I think I distinctly... Somebody who got so disheartened by losing.
[138:48.59]I distinctly remember somebody saying that, wow, Jerma, you beat Cuphead really quickly with so few deaths.
[138:54.30]That's really good.
[138:55.12]Really good job.
[138:55.66]Like four hours and 25 minutes?
[138:56.64]Four hours?
[138:59.10]It was not four hours.
[139:02.46]Yes it was.
[139:05.16]What are you doing?
[139:06.04]You're going to end the stream.
[139:07.66]What are you thinking?
[139:08.56]You're going to hit my end stream button.
[139:10.02]Why are you hitting enter?
[139:11.49]I wasn't hitting enter.
[139:12.41]I was trying to shift tab to see how many hours you had.
[139:15.39]Shift?
[139:15.71]There's no shift.
[139:16.31]I don't have steam overlay.
[139:17.43]Why the fuck would I have that enabled?
[139:22.01]So I can tell how much you suck.
[139:25.63]Let's go.
[139:26.49]I got the controls down again.
[139:28.41]Really?
[139:28.95]You got in the way.
[139:30.18]That's all that mattered.
[139:32.90]Do you?
[139:33.20]It's... Why did I drink that much?
[139:44.35]I can't even, like, fucking tap.
[139:46.25]Come get me.
[139:47.61]Come get me, please.
[139:49.07]Gotcha.
[139:50.59]He's back.
[139:51.07]I'm not gonna get hit again.
[139:53.95]I'm gonna get hit on this part, for sure.
[139:55.01]Because I don't understand it.
[139:58.13]He shoots.
[140:01.02]Get me, get me!
[140:01.98]You're too far away!
[140:03.00]What is this?
[140:19.51]What's happening?
[140:20.31]The cash machine, the register.
[140:23.65]I don't remember any of this!
[140:26.87]You're not doing it right.
[140:27.49]I don't know what you're supposed to do.
[140:29.16]You're not doing it right.
[140:30.04]Give me the controller!
[140:34.10]Calm down, man.
[140:36.52]That would be so bad.
[140:37.94]You jump, jump, jump.
[140:39.42]Backseat this guy.
[140:40.38]Backseat him.
[140:40.78]He's not doing it right.
[140:43.72]You stay on the left.
[140:49.13]I stay on the right.
[140:50.37]Get away from me.
[140:51.59]Stay on the left.
[140:52.71]That's the issue.
[140:54.09]That's the issue?
[140:54.61]Yes!
[140:54.87]You're gonna get hit faster!
[140:56.37]Fucking god, he's right!
[140:57.45]God damn it!
[140:58.55]It's too hard with two people on the screen!
[141:02.15]With two people on the screen, it's a fucking impossible task!
[141:05.30]You're the one on front too!
[141:07.38]You gotta help me with the guys on the above.
[141:09.16]No, you have the shotgun!
[141:11.46]I just shoot the guy, you shotgun the other guys when they get close!
[141:14.56]Fine.
[141:14.86]All you gotta do is remember to jump.
[141:18.50]I am remembering, you're just taking up my screen!
[141:25.29]This is working pretty well.
[141:26.06]I'm good.
[141:30.04]See?
[141:31.84]Everything's going according... You're shooting backwards, but that's okay.
[141:35.08]I have to focus on the guys above.
[141:37.39]This is expert ball.
[141:38.25]This is not for children.
[141:40.25]Looks like it, but it's not.
[141:41.31]Okay, don't fuck this part up.
[141:46.82]He's gonna shoot on the bottom first.
[141:55.68]Here we go.
[141:57.44]Here they come.
[141:58.54]We're good.
[142:09.22]We're good.
[142:09.56]Okay, cash register.
[142:10.60]Get ready.
[142:11.12]Get ready.
[142:11.70]Make it happen.
[142:12.08]Make it happen.
[142:12.68]We both have super.
[142:14.54]What's super again?
[142:15.46]Circle.
[142:15.66]Circle.
[142:17.16]Just get out of the way.
[142:19.60]You want to get it or me?
[142:22.71]You.
[142:23.45]Because I'm dead.
[142:26.37]Fucked it up.
[142:27.19]You fucked it up.
[142:27.92]Hey, you died last time.
[142:29.16]Before this part, remember?
[142:30.26]I'm gonna do my super right now.
[142:32.26]Okay, that kind of killed me, but that's okay.
[142:37.44]You supered when I needed to jump out of the way!
[142:40.28]I don't have anything equipped.
[142:46.98]No, I am just the vanilla Cuphead.
[142:51.66]Start it over.
[142:52.28]Fucking start it over.
[142:53.90]It's turning into the rage stream.
[142:57.83]Two blind streamers?
[142:59.05]No, it's just we're both drunk.
[143:01.49]Don't even give that excuse.
[143:02.39]That's not an excuse.
[143:08.00]This boss is fucking easy.
[143:09.86]I beat this guy.
[143:11.12]I beat this boss.
[143:12.88]It doesn't matter.
[143:13.42]I beat this guy like first fucking try.
[143:15.08]Like two tries.
[143:16.72]Come on, Jeremy.
[143:17.49]Give it a break.
[143:25.07]I am playing complete vanilla.
[143:29.77]Why did I jump over that one?
[143:31.04]You really blow at this.
[143:33.64]I still got two hits.
[143:36.34]Here it comes.
[143:36.94]Get ready.
[143:37.78]I'm ready.
[143:38.24]So we need a three, two, one super, okay?
[143:40.66]Does that make sense?
[143:41.64]Okay.
[143:41.94]If you're going to do a super, do super three, two, one.
[143:45.10]I have more cards than you, though.
[143:46.79]No, you have... Yeah.
[143:51.33]Fucking eat my dick!
[143:58.34]We're good.
[143:59.62]Calm down.
[144:02.59]Here comes the boxes.
[144:03.81]Got you.
[144:06.13]Don't worry.
[144:06.65]We got it.
[144:07.09]Calm down.
[144:07.47]We're good.
[144:07.95]Here you come.
[144:08.43]Slot machine.
[144:13.21]Okay.
[144:14.02]Okay.
[144:14.70]I'm going to do mine first, okay?
[144:17.06]Not yet.
[144:22.30]Why do I only have one?
[144:23.32]Why?
[144:23.46]You only get one HP when you come.
[144:25.77]Don't do it yet.
[144:26.67]Just be easy.
[144:32.55]Lucky I fucking know what I'm doing.
[144:34.27]I'm just doing the super.
[144:37.85]Get me.
[144:39.91]Thank you.
[144:47.10]It still counts.
[144:47.86]You have a super.
[144:48.60]No, you don't.
[144:52.64]Oh, not again.
[144:53.81]This is like the fifth death.
[144:55.85]Help me.
[144:59.25]Get me!
[144:59.69]Get me!
[145:00.15]Get me!
[145:01.33]I return the favor.
[145:04.63]Okay, easy.
[145:06.77]You have a super.
[145:07.87]I do?
[145:08.38]Yes, you do.
[145:08.84]Do it now!
[145:09.24]Do it now!
[145:09.62]Do it now!
[145:10.02]Do it!
[145:10.92]Why does it... I don't have anything equipped.
[145:13.06]Because I don't have anything equipped, the default is just the big launching thing.
[145:19.33]There's no super because I don't have one equipped.
[145:21.75]Put it on.
[145:22.89]Put it on.
[145:24.13]Put it on.
[145:26.04]Put it on.
[145:27.78]Go take me to the shop.
[145:30.82]Buy me a nice trinket.
[145:33.46]At Porky's Emporium.
[145:35.96]Anchor German.
[145:40.21]How do I buy one?
[145:42.23]What do I want?
[145:43.29]Whatever you want.
[145:47.32]Oh yeah, I have to buy them from scratch.
[145:50.18]Uh...
[145:53.12]Someone's getting dropped off at the airport tonight.
[145:55.34]Invisible dash.
[145:59.64]I have to buy stuff to, like, how do I get the super, though?
[146:02.75]Do you buy it from here?
[146:04.83]Yes, you do.
[146:05.85]Sorry, just to keep buying stuff.
[146:07.07]Get the shotgun.
[146:09.07]Get the shotgun.
[146:09.53]To the right.
[146:12.49]Radial barrage.
[146:13.19]Hold attack to increase damage.
[146:14.53]That's the charge.
[146:15.05]You want that.
[146:16.41]Do I, though?
[146:16.95]Yes, you do.
[146:17.44]It's the best thing in the game.
[146:21.00]Now what?
[146:21.36]That's the automatic parry.
[146:22.16]Go to the right.
[146:23.56]That one.
[146:23.88]That one.
[146:26.39]Aim backward for... No, this is the one that shoots forward and it goes backwards.
[146:29.97]Get it.
[146:31.31]Why?
[146:32.13]I want the supers.
[146:32.97]Get it.
[146:36.14]Okay.
[146:38.00]Get it!
[146:38.34]To the left.
[146:41.00]No, to the left.
[146:43.44]Get it.
[146:43.70]Thank you.
[146:46.29]That's not it.
[146:46.75]All right, we're good.
[146:47.87]Hippie.
[146:51.26]You get the super from the ghost rooms.
[146:53.56]You just read that in chat.
[146:54.41]Yeah.
[146:55.05]I think you can fucking pretend.
[146:55.83]Because they told me.
[146:56.49]Because he's not telling me.
[146:57.77]Chat's more trustworthy.
[146:59.13]There you are.
[147:05.69]Charge is fine.
[147:06.45]That's fine.
[147:07.21]I want my, I want my.
[147:08.33]You have not even a single charm.
[147:10.77]Charm.
[147:11.25]I want invisible.
[147:11.97]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[147:13.13]Invisible dash is the easy mode.
[147:14.95]No, it's not.
[147:15.52]Shut up.
[147:17.75]Yeah, it is.
[147:18.59]So the whole time he's been having problems.
[147:20.05]Invisible Dash is easy mode.
[147:22.55]Skip that one.
[147:22.97]We're not doing that one right now.
[147:24.33]We obviously can't fucking handle that one.
[147:25.51]Come over here.
[147:27.13]Sometimes you have to change it up and get something new in your life.
[147:30.87]Let's go to... No, no, no.
[147:35.29]Over here.
[147:36.71]This one.
[147:38.75]This is the ruse of a noose.
[147:40.92]That's what it says, yes.
[147:42.48]This is the blob from Clayfighter.
[147:45.08]Okay.
[147:45.95]Remember this guy?
[147:46.49]Yep, he's the first boss you play in the game.
[147:53.63]This guy's not that bad.
[147:55.81]Watch out, he's gonna punch you in the face.
[147:56.87]He's gonna punch you in the face.
[147:59.66]Nice work, excellent job.
[148:04.74]Didn't get hit by me.
[148:09.80]Why?
[148:10.62]Why?
[148:12.00]This is so much easier if you weren't so jokey.
[148:15.46]Get three.
[148:16.32]One, two, three.
[148:17.90]Let me do all the work.
[148:25.56]I can't even get you.
[148:26.70]I got to do it by myself.
[148:29.44]Help.
[148:30.80]Someone save me, please.
[148:32.04]I'm just mad.
[148:34.48]How did you dash through him?
[148:39.70]I just, I dashed.
[148:41.10]Also, I definitely did not equip charge.
[148:43.52]Why?
[148:44.58]I forgot.
[148:47.98]Look at how much further I got than you.
[148:53.60]All right, all right, we'll see.
[148:54.86]We'll see.
[148:58.74]You play expert mode on Cuphead once you've like, you have like fucking 100 hours in the game and you're ready for the next one.
[149:05.76]Focus more about getting away than getting like... I didn't know I was gonna bounce off the wall like that.
[149:14.91]Just make sure he's going to eat the pill.
[149:17.47]There you go.
[149:17.91]We're doing fine.
[149:19.37]Nice work.
[149:24.34]Fucking lightning reflexes.
[149:25.94]There he goes.
[149:29.56]Okay, ready?
[149:29.94]I'll get him.
[149:30.54]I'm going to stay together.
[149:35.33]He's looking at me funny.
[149:37.21]Here comes the punch.
[149:39.41]Ready?
[149:41.49]It's all right.
[149:43.03]Just stay over there.
[149:44.01]Just chill over there, we'll get it.
[149:46.13]Here comes the jump.
[149:48.11]Fucking eat my asshole.
[149:53.03]I tried.
[149:56.82]Expert mode first boss in the game is like harder than the other guy.
[150:06.30]All right.
[150:07.10]Sweaty hands.
[150:09.00]Relax.
[150:09.42]I'm going to use the shotgun.
[150:14.67]It's stupid for me.
[150:15.37]No, it's not.
[150:15.99]It's not stupid.
[150:16.43]All right.
[150:22.93]Be quiet.
[150:24.19]I'm not talking.
[150:27.25]You be quiet.
[150:28.09]Be quiet.
[150:28.67]You're talking too loud.
[150:36.55]You fucking piece of shit.
[150:43.84]Why are you doing that?
[150:44.86]Well, I'm supposed to get that.
[150:45.98]I have to pee.
[150:51.18]No, I do too.
[150:52.08]Then get up here.
[150:54.84]No.
[150:55.14]There's only one.
[151:02.59]I've been perfectly sober this entire time.
[151:04.41]I wasn't actually drinking any alcohol.
[151:05.78]I'm just putting on a ruse for German.
[151:07.00]Don't tell him.
[152:54.76]Damn it.
[152:56.64]We're going to beat this, I promise.
[152:58.40]I got the Dan Aykroyd vodka down here now.
[153:05.97]No audio.
[153:06.35]Don't tell me, what do you mean don't tell me, what?
[153:25.17]This is the Indiana Jones vodka.
[153:33.14]That was bad.
[153:34.32]Oh, that was bad.
[153:34.76]It could be worse if you put that on.
[153:36.14]That was bad.
[153:38.24]Which is my controller?
[153:41.08]Is yours the one that's way spreadier than mine?
[153:43.86]Where are my headphones?
[153:44.71]We have two separate headphones.
[153:46.15]Look at this nonsense.
[153:47.69]They're both identical, too.
[153:48.75]They're both identical.
[153:49.47]Good luck.
[153:50.69]We have the same headphones.
[153:51.83]Yeah.
[153:53.21]I'm just going to take these ones.
[153:56.30]Okay, so I would like to, we're going to do a handshake, okay?
[154:00.26]We're going to do a handshake.
[154:01.04]Did you wash your hands?
[154:02.22]No.
[154:04.06]We're not doing a handshake.
[154:04.92]I don't wash my hands.
[154:05.78]I wash my hands and make food for people all the time.
[154:08.31]Ready?
[154:10.17]Repeat after me, okay?
[154:12.51]I'm going.
[154:14.59]I'm going.
[154:15.39]To try as hard.
[154:16.79]To try as hard.
[154:18.05]As I fucking can.
[154:19.32]As I fucking can.
[154:20.32]To beat this expert level.
[154:22.14]To beat this expert level.
[154:23.42]In local co-op of Cuphead.
[154:24.90]In local co-op of Cuphead.
[154:26.48]Okay.
[154:26.98]Good handshake.
[154:27.50]He's got a strong handshake.
[154:28.46]Here we go.
[154:28.94]Now that's a legal bond, by the way.
[154:32.92]It's a legal bond.
[154:34.86]You literally, it's illegal if we don't do this.
[154:38.00]Political.
[154:39.42]Okay.
[154:40.96]I'm still in the game.
[154:41.68]You're still in the game.
[154:42.56]Why is this illegal?
[154:44.13]You're in the game.
[154:47.00]Now we're dead.
[154:48.48]Couldn't try.
[154:48.84]Could've tried a little harder right there.
[154:49.98]Okay, are you ready?
[154:50.92]Legobond, we have to be alright.
[154:51.74]Told you we were trying as hard as we can.
[154:53.14]This is so much louder.
[154:54.18]Why?
[154:54.54]I have your headphones.
[154:56.60]I have your headphones and they're fucking way louder.
[154:58.92]Yours are louder.
[155:00.04]The whole game's louder.
[155:00.96]Okay, give me my headphones back.
[155:05.59]Switch this shit up.
[155:06.91]You're dumb.
[155:07.45]No, those are my headphones.
[155:08.91]Those are mine.
[155:09.41]Mine are broken.
[155:09.85]Those are mine.
[155:16.18]Cheers to that.
[155:19.44]Ready?
[155:26.72]Beat it.
[155:33.12]So far, so good.
[155:34.68]Watch out!
[155:37.98]Nice.
[155:39.52]No damage here.
[155:40.18]This is too easy.
[155:40.74]Let me get this.
[155:41.22]I'll get it.
[155:44.81]Good.
[155:51.06]Perfect place.
[155:51.61]Thought I could hide in the corner.
[155:56.57]Almost.
[155:59.29]See?
[155:59.63]See?
[156:00.39]That corner.
[156:01.11]That's the one.
[156:01.83]I have a super.
[156:02.39]Ready?
[156:02.71]I'm gonna use it.
[156:03.19]Ready?
[156:04.27]Three, two, one.
[156:05.16]Using it.
[156:05.40]What do you mean you're dead?
[156:07.06]I'm dead.
[156:07.84]Why are you dead?
[156:08.56]Okay, I gotta beat this.
[156:13.40]What does he do here if I get... I don't know.
[156:15.30]He just moves.
[156:32.49]It's really hot in here.
[156:33.17]Yeah, just turn the heater off.
[156:37.68]It's really hot in here.
[156:39.44]It's on high.
[156:40.10]Why?
[156:40.20]It's on high 75.
[156:49.50]That's why you do the handshake.
[156:51.56]That's why you shake the fucking hand.
[156:53.37]As long as one of us wins, we both win.
[156:56.63]Oh, sorry.
[157:00.89]What's happening?
[157:01.75]It's so loud.
[157:02.63]This didn't happen to you when you played last time?
[157:03.95]That's snapping.
[157:05.11]This didn't happen to you?
[157:06.55]Ah.
[157:08.05]Why is it on 75?
[157:08.65]It was on 75.
[157:12.17]Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[157:14.26]The heat was set on 75.
[157:17.72]No wonder I'm sweaty.
[157:19.48]Whoops.
[157:21.82]Cigarette spaghetti, thanks for the $100.
[157:22.90]Fuck, that's like $700 just from you.
[157:23.88]All the bits, boys.
[157:24.30]All the bits.
[157:31.36]Oh my fucking god.
[157:34.06]Why was it that high?
[157:37.93]Thank you so much, everybody.
[157:38.77]There's so many bits.
[157:39.63]There's so much fucking money that came in.
[157:43.13]Thank you.
[157:43.75]That's fucking unbelievable.
[157:45.45]Yes, thank you guys.
[157:46.61]Considering that we made the bet on bits earlier and I won.
[157:50.18]But you lost at the same time.
[157:52.97]But I won.
[157:53.79]Thank you, guys.
[157:55.31]You guys are fucking too kind, for real.
[157:57.83]Alright, let's do this one.
[157:59.29]What is this one?
[158:00.79]Threatening Zeppelin.
[158:01.83]What's this one?
[158:04.68]Oh, this is when you're flying in the air.
[158:05.88]This one's easy for me.
[158:09.44]Not me!
[158:11.28]Just pay attention.
[158:12.98]Expert.
[158:13.42]Pay attention.
[158:14.84]Remember, if you hold Y or triangle, you go into super idle mode.
[158:23.48]Sometimes you forget.
[158:25.02]It's okay.
[158:25.40]We're good.
[158:31.32]That's new?
[158:33.08]That's a new thing.
[158:34.01]We're good.
[158:37.91]Don't we have... I... Don't we have a missile launcher?
[158:43.49]I thought we had a missile launcher.
[158:47.67]Holy fucking... Holy shit.
[158:50.42]I'm trying to come get you.
[158:53.03]There's no reason for me to continue playing, but I feel like I need to assert my dominance.
[158:56.79]Assert it.
[158:58.71]Dominate me.
[158:59.29]Come on.
[159:01.11]Dominate me.
[159:03.25]Do it.
[159:03.89]I'm ready.
[159:04.27]Come on.
[159:17.06]Didn't even assert his dominance.
[159:18.48]Don't break that control.
[159:19.28]Look at how much further I got than you.
[159:21.56]Oh, like a fucking inch.
[159:22.74]That's how much taller you are than me.
[159:25.76]I thought we were the same height, but okay.
[159:28.69]I'll take it.
[159:29.09]Shh.
[159:29.27]Quiet.
[159:31.55]Hey, you started it.
[159:32.95]Here we go.
[159:33.89]Easy.
[159:34.65]Just pay attention.
[159:35.41]Fuck, almost got hit.
[159:36.21]Watch out.
[159:42.48]Oh.
[159:44.59]Yeah, watch out.
[159:46.05]Careful or you might die.
[159:49.01]A great slam and then some.
[159:50.37]A great slam and then some.
[159:51.51]Cuphead, expert, co-op.
[159:52.97]You can't even fucking tell where you are on the screen because it's fucking two people and an expert.
[159:58.52]You already got one.
[160:00.18]I got hit.
[160:01.30]I didn't get hit.
[160:01.86]I didn't get hit by that.
[160:03.16]It looked like you did.
[160:03.98]Watch out.
[160:05.48]She's gonna come back, she comes back!
[160:07.62]You have one HP!
[160:09.36]Get it together!
[160:09.92]That's all I need!
[160:10.90]Get it together!
[160:12.22]That's all I need!
[160:15.94]Go little.
[160:16.74]When that thing comes up, go little.
[160:28.04]It's a bullet hell game, just do it right.
[160:31.51]All I gotta do is build up to super and then I'm done.
[160:34.25]I'm gonna be done.
[160:36.03]Thank you for giving my one HP back.
[160:37.85]All right, watch out, watch out.
[160:39.22]Easy, easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
[160:42.30]Can you fight it and happen?
[160:43.20]Don't worry, I'll just rescue you the whole time.
[160:46.73]Okay, seriously though,
[160:49.71]I know it's an excuse, but when you play, like, 12 hours of this game being the red character, and then you have to be the blue character.
[160:57.78]It's like being Luigi in Mario.
[161:00.58]I'm gonna save you when I die.
[161:05.89]Why are you not shooting those?
[161:06.69]Do I have to do everything?
[161:08.69]Do I have to shoot both of those?
[161:10.99]Get me!
[161:12.99]Get me!
[161:16.27]We're close.
[161:16.63]We're good.
[161:17.05]We're close.
[161:17.53]We're like halfway there.
[161:18.85]This match will get red hot.
[161:21.79]I bet he gave him the Mad Catz controller too.
[161:25.94]I actually would rather be using the Mad Catz controller right now.
[161:28.86]Looks like synchronize our FPS here.
[161:32.44]Let's synchronize our watches.
[161:34.49]You guys wouldn't believe how much harder this game is with two people.
[161:38.43]And I'll tell you why.
[161:39.27]Because I think I'm moving when he's moving.
[161:41.91]I'm not used to that fucking movement.
[161:44.31]Like, I'm used to me knowing where I am on the screen at all times.
[161:46.87]And you're the only person doing it.
[161:48.11]And I'm the only person.
[161:49.17]Where's it going?
[161:51.37]Are we good?
[161:56.51]Get it?
[161:57.85]No.
[161:58.29]Both doing fine.
[162:00.47]Why'd you say anything?
[162:02.35]I'm gonna make you drink vodka in like ten seconds.
[162:05.26]You're gonna down a fucking bottle of vodka in five seconds.
[162:08.86]Shut up, Jeremy!
[162:09.58]And you're gonna be right behind me.
[162:11.22]Jeremy, shut your mouth.
[162:13.28]And fucking do it the way you know you can.
[162:15.34]Good.
[162:16.97]You beat this game on stream.
[162:18.59]You did it fast.
[162:20.69]You did it faster than any streamer.
[162:22.03]I'm not gonna get fucking hit again.
[162:27.34]There's a lot of people.
[162:29.30]Get me, please.
[162:30.24]Save me.
[162:32.28]Eat shit.
[162:35.40]Oh, no.
[162:39.52]Am I?
[162:39.88]How am I over there?
[162:40.88]You're fine.
[162:41.28]You're fine.
[162:41.58]You're fine.
[162:41.86]You're alive.
[162:44.62]Saved.
[162:45.16]Get rid of the stars.
[162:48.79]Oh, my God.
[163:00.41]Too stressful.
[163:02.95]There's too much happening.
[163:09.83]We almost made it to the one.
[163:10.88]We got a little further than we did before.
[163:17.30]Come on.
[163:18.66]We're close enough.
[163:19.98]Get ready.
[163:20.56]Shut up.
[163:22.78]I'll do it.
[163:24.46]Good idea.
[163:25.12]That's a good idea.
[163:26.70]Quiet.
[163:27.00]Nope.
[163:29.83]Wait, pause it.
[163:30.85]Wait, wait, wait.
[163:32.63]Easy, easy.
[163:34.45]Just pause it.
[163:35.37]Pause it.
[163:37.09]For the rest of this entire encounter, we're going to be quiet.
[163:44.44]Just pay attention.
[163:45.92]Do your dashes.
[163:47.68]Do your parries.
[163:50.42]Forget about me.
[163:50.96]I'm not even here.
[163:53.30]These people aren't even here.
[163:55.12]Yeah, we're doing this for us.
[163:56.06]We're doing this for us.
[163:57.34]Okay.
[163:58.23]Matter of pride.
[163:58.87]Okay, here we go.
[164:00.59]One, two, three.
[164:02.43]Repeat after me.
[164:03.19]No, let's just play, let's go.
[164:04.49]Okay, go.
[164:09.65]We're gonna be quiet?
[164:19.75]Shut up, you're supposed to be quiet.
[164:24.90]Okay, that one was not fair.
[164:37.55]Bullshit!
[164:38.11]That one was not fair, though.
[164:39.97]Easy.
[164:40.47]Quiet.
[164:40.85]Okay.
[164:52.92]Yes!
[165:27.57]That was pretty good.
[165:32.45]That was pretty good for a little while, come on.
[165:34.87]You wanna know why he didn't have as many deaths as I did?
[165:45.52]The retry button right here is why.
[165:48.26]It doesn't count deaths when you push the retry button, that's why.
[165:51.38]Hold that over my head.
[166:02.55]That was tough.
[166:40.52]She keeps shooting in the gaps!
[166:45.08]Quiet, quiet, quiet!
[166:46.04]No talking!
[166:59.15]You finally killed him!
[167:11.24]Come on.
[167:19.75]So you guys only see when I get hit like five minutes in.
[167:22.25]You're not counting all the times he's gotten hit in the first five seconds.
[167:25.75]We have to watch out for the fucking coffee beans and just play.
[167:31.10]Did you get hit?
[167:32.78]That was you.
[167:33.44]That was you!
[167:34.14]How?
[167:34.34]2 HP, 3.
[167:34.78]Why the fuck didn't it make a synchro?
[167:39.12]The flying level is way harder.
[167:42.20]It is way harder.
[167:45.41]We gotta synchronize.
[167:46.15]When you see somebody, go for them immediately.
[167:47.93]One of these little dumb shit enemies.
[167:49.71]They, like, go off the screen.
[167:52.01]Focus on those are priority number one.
[167:54.27]Oh my god!
[168:00.94]That was bullshit.
[168:01.86]That was bullshit when you got hit by it.
[168:03.88]That was bullshit.
[168:04.50]That was just bullshit.
[168:05.20]It's expert mode.
[168:05.92]You gotta be fucking ready.
[168:14.71]Sorry.
[168:15.01]You're good.
[168:16.11]You're good.
[168:16.65]You're good.
[168:17.19]I'm going for it.
[168:18.29]Alright, we're gonna get phase two.
[168:22.11]Phase two is coming up here.
[168:23.07]Just be careful.
[168:29.43]We're good.
[168:30.13]You have a super.
[168:31.00]You need to use it for any reason.
[168:32.04]You know what I mean?
[168:33.90]All right.
[168:34.14]You're going to use it now?
[168:36.26]Good for you.
[168:37.12]Here we go.
[168:37.92]Watch out.
[168:38.20]I got you.
[168:38.48]I got you.
[168:39.56]I got you.
[168:39.88]Just come on in.
[168:40.70]Come on.
[168:41.10]We're going to get to the moon phase.
[168:49.46]Oh, eat my fucking asshole.
[168:50.76]Come on.
[168:51.08]Good.
[168:51.32]Nice job.
[168:51.90]You didn't eat my asshole.
[168:52.81]Nice work.
[168:58.30]That's a greeting.
[168:59.00]It's all right, we're good.
[169:00.86]Just get it.
[169:01.32]Here we go.
[169:08.10]We're almost in phase three.
[169:09.06]Get me, please.
[169:09.66]God.
[169:10.44]I was going for you.
[169:11.44]I had to go all the way.
[169:12.40]We're so close to phase three, and it's phase three.
[169:14.46]Fuck.
[169:15.72]Good day for a swell battle.
[169:18.94]You're up.
[169:26.93]Oh my god, I'm so mad.
[169:30.15]This match will get red hot.
[169:33.29]We gotta go back to the frogs.
[169:34.07]A really fun video game.
[169:35.07]We gotta go back to the frogs.
[169:36.44]We kinda do, yeah.
[169:37.98]When we die again.
[169:38.70]No, we're not gonna die again.
[169:39.48]We're gonna win right here.
[169:40.28]When we win, we'll go back to the frogs.
[169:42.26]This is a win right here.
[169:44.28]You took unnecessary damage.
[169:46.58]I was you in my head.
[169:54.03]It's not like that.
[169:54.75]Just take it easy.
[169:56.58]I think I shoot one bullet.
[170:01.73]It goes clockwards, clockwards.
[170:03.99]I couldn't see.
[170:05.50]I couldn't see.
[170:06.34]You're good.
[170:07.98]As long as we get to third phase, then we know we have what it takes to continue, okay?
[170:13.18]I don't have what it takes.
[170:16.52]I'm not there.
[170:17.14]Talix, I drank like fucking a lot of alcohol tonight.
[170:21.14]Yeah.
[170:21.50]And I'm ready.
[170:23.12]You're also playing on home turf right now.
[170:25.14]That's true.
[170:26.22]He does have a point.
[170:28.48]That was bullshit.
[170:29.08]That was fucking horseshit and everybody knows it.
[170:35.34]Nice idea, but don't get hit, good.
[170:38.88]We're almost at phase three.
[170:41.35]It's these stupid stars.
[170:42.51]I was going for the rescue.
[170:51.31]What about the handshake?
[170:54.21]I haven't forgotten.
[171:03.34]This is the one.
[171:04.54]This is actually the one.
[171:06.54]I'm not fucking around on this one.
[171:08.84]I'm going full fucking psycho try-hard mode, for real.
[171:19.03]That wasn't fair!
[171:34.44]Good job.
[172:16.00]Me!
[172:17.80]Me!
[172:21.09]Me!
[172:21.41]You gotta get rid of these stars, man!
[172:24.77]Me!
[172:24.99]You gotta get rid of these stars!
[172:26.61]Calm down!
[172:27.55]Jimmy!
[172:33.00]Just dodge!
[172:36.80]Oh no!
[172:37.50]I'm too high up!
[172:38.14]I got it!
[172:38.50]I got it!
[172:38.72]I got it!
[172:39.02]I got it!
[172:39.28]I got it!
[172:39.48]I got it!
[172:39.70]I got it!
[172:53.48]What the fuck are you supposed to do?
[172:55.27]Four enemies on screen.
[173:11.97]Get up here.
[173:17.02]Oh, it's another boss.
[173:28.02]I didn't know.
[173:28.52]Look at the tarantulas!
[173:30.76]Pay attention to the tarantulas, dude!
[173:32.10]What was that?
[173:40.95]Jesus fucking Christ!
[173:46.40]There's too many things on the screen.
[173:48.38]There really are.
[173:49.72]I can't even tell what things are on the screen are even friendly.
[173:53.18]No.
[173:53.36]Are there friendlies?
[173:54.20]I don't want to go to friendlies.
[173:56.28]They have terrible grilled cheeses.
[173:58.76]Friendlies sucks.
[174:05.32]Watch out.
[174:06.48]Watch out for the brain.
[174:12.56]Thank you.
[174:13.14]Dude.
[174:16.62]Good work.
[174:17.38]Nice call.
[174:20.52]Help me, please!
[174:21.82]You're like, off the screen.
[174:26.88]Fuck.
[174:30.64]Even a third of the way through.
[174:35.40]What did you do, by the way?
[174:40.87]How do people do this?
[174:45.10]Sorry, just cleaning up my cuts.
[174:50.66]One of us has to be in charge of getting rid of these things.
[174:53.18]I will be in charge of that.
[174:54.31]You deal with the fucking... the guy, the boss.
[174:57.91]I will... What did I get hit by?
[174:59.61]The fucking watermelons.
[175:02.95]Explain to me how a human is supposed to do that.
[175:05.75]How are two humans... How do two humans complete this level?
[175:13.15]A brawl is surely brewing.
[175:15.74]How are two humans supposed to beat this?
[175:18.44]I know that TAS fucking team speak bullshit.
[175:21.16]Two real humans?
[175:24.87]A brawl is surely brewing.
[175:26.57]How do two humans do this on expert?
[175:29.03]I don't know.
[175:29.41]It's not possible.
[175:35.43]Oh my goodness.
[175:36.58]There's nowhere to go.
[175:38.76]There's nowhere to go.
[175:44.44]There's nowhere to fucking go!
[175:52.83]There's nowhere to go!
[175:58.77]There's nowhere to go!
[176:00.59]Nope.
[176:11.88]Find me the two humans that'll do that on fucking Expert.
[176:15.54]Two humans on Expert, please.
[176:17.89]Find the two humans that'll do that.
[176:19.19]This is not World 1.
[176:20.35]This is like Secret World.
[176:22.47]Frogs.
[176:22.77]It's the frogs right now.
[176:24.19]Yeah, we almost beat the frogs like four times.
[176:33.90]I don't understand how two humans are supposed to do this on Expert.
[176:36.64]We can do this one, though.
[176:37.66]We can do this one.
[176:39.55]This one we can do.
[176:41.44]Just two regular Zumbinis.
[176:42.54]We've warmed up.
[176:43.50]Just a couple of Zumbinis.
[176:45.44]Not a big deal.
[176:51.86]I think I might be too drunk for this.
[176:54.88]I'm doing, like, so much.
[176:56.75]You're just now coming to that conclusion.
[176:58.55]I've gotten, like, progressively worse at this game.
[177:01.35]Yeah.
[177:02.19]No, definitely have.
[177:11.24]My eyes hurt.
[177:14.06]Calm down.
[177:14.50]We can get this one.
[177:15.16]This one's not even easy.
[177:16.14]I've seen streamers fucking beat this one on expert.
[177:18.65]Maybe not with two humans.
[177:21.29]With one human, it's already enough.
[177:24.55]We got it this time.
[177:29.75]Dude, I'm gonna bro a fucking cup.
[177:32.23]I'm gonna bro... I'm gonna brew a cup of coffee.
[177:35.87]And you can, like, beat this.
[177:37.13]Oh, yeah?
[177:37.67]Super now.
[177:38.01]Super, super, super, super now.
[177:39.11]Now, now, now, now.
[177:39.61]Do it.
[177:42.94]Okay.
[177:44.58]It was worth it.
[177:52.28]Here comes the boxing gloves.
[177:55.98]I got this.
[177:56.54]Jump.
[177:58.75]Okay.
[178:00.19]Here it comes.
[178:02.43]He forgot how to shoot.
[178:03.43]Here it comes.
[178:03.77]Here it comes.
[178:04.63]I got three HP.
[178:05.47]You got one.
[178:05.97]Just be careful.
[178:08.17]Thanks for reminding me.
[178:09.63]I'll get it.
[178:10.31]I'll get it.
[178:10.77]You hang out.
[178:12.05]Just dodge.
[178:15.43]God, no!
[178:18.51]Don't worry, I'll handle this.
[178:23.47]See, you're better on this one for sure.
[178:26.54]This one's so easy.
[178:27.34]Just fucking jump really easily.
[178:35.48]I fucking tried to save your ass.
[178:37.56]Hey, you got hit first.
[178:40.47]I'll get it.
[178:41.27]Hurry up!
[178:44.72]Easy.
[178:45.54]You have a super.
[178:46.16]I do.
[178:46.50]I'm waiting.
[178:46.96]When is he vulnerable?
[178:47.75]Use it now.
[178:53.17]I'll get it.
[179:03.10]You win this one by default.
[179:06.72]I got a super.
[179:07.12]I'm going to use it.
[179:07.68]Ready?
[179:09.40]I'm ready.
[179:09.78]Here it comes.
[179:14.88]You couldn't just survive.
[179:16.30]You couldn't just survive.
[179:27.36]I couldn't just survive.
[179:29.75]I'm sorry.
[179:31.33]I'm better at the flower one.
[179:33.11]The frog one's too much.
[179:41.35]The platforming, man.
[179:43.84]It's the fast-paced platforming.
[179:46.40]Here we go.
[179:55.47]Easy, easy.
[179:57.11]No, we gotta start over.
[179:57.89]That was you.
[179:59.89]Visual.
[180:00.33]No, it's full screen.
[180:01.13]We're fine.
[180:03.31]Back to Family Guy.
[180:05.23]Let's go back to Family Guy.
[180:08.07]Are you good?
[180:08.51]You need to change any items?
[180:16.18]Okay, see, no one remembers the times we retry at the beginning of the round.
[180:20.71]They only remember when I die like three quarters of the way.
[180:22.91]Did you see my dodges last game?
[180:24.73]They were fucking on point.
[180:26.35]They were crazy.
[180:28.13]They would write articles about that on Kotaku.
[180:30.34]Okay, see, here we go again.
[180:32.06]Three times in a row wasn't me.
[180:33.78]I want everyone to realize this, please.
[180:36.10]Fucking Kotaku would have written articles about my dodges last attempt.
[180:43.17]Four times in a row.
[180:45.48]Four!
[180:47.34]We're at the Polygon article!
[180:51.66]Shut it!
[180:54.04]We're almost not dealing with the ants above us!
[180:56.45]You're not dealing with the ants!
[180:57.87]As you can see, you're not dealing with the ants above us!
[181:01.27]Five!
[181:01.77]You don't have to deal with the ants!
[181:06.96]You just have to shoot normally!
[181:09.90]I gotta deal with the fucking ants?
[181:14.84]I gotta change the weapons and shit.
[181:20.89]Who's the one cleaning up the ants?
[181:22.73]It's not Italics.
[181:24.95]It's moi.
[181:27.43]And he still gets hit, even though I'm the one cleaning up the ants.
[181:30.55]Yeah, well, one out of six ain't bad.
[181:40.26]We're gonna win this one.
[181:41.58]Here it comes.
[181:47.48]Alright.
[181:49.08]You gotta tell me when you're gonna do that.
[181:50.17]I'm doing it when no one's attacking.
[181:55.27]Fucking eat it!
[182:00.47]Here comes a bullet.
[182:01.05]We're good.
[182:07.16]I have a super.
[182:07.54]I'm not gonna use it.
[182:10.10]Panic.
[182:10.48]I panicked.
[182:11.16]Don't panic.
[182:12.10]No reason to panic.
[182:12.82]We're fine.
[182:14.19]Everything's gonna be fine.
[182:15.07]Don't panic.
[182:16.54]Here it comes.
[182:16.94]Phase 3.
[182:18.44]Just dodge.
[182:19.26]Just take your mind out of it.
[182:24.12]Shut... I got it.
[182:35.19]Don't worry.
[182:35.57]I got this.
[183:00.05]You're pretty close.
[183:04.87]You're pretty close.
[183:28.68]We're sweating like crazy.
[183:30.64]Sick.
[184:05.54]Where am I?
[184:08.44]Hey!
[184:10.42]I'm home!
[184:12.40]We've beaten this game.
[184:13.50]Both of us have beaten this game.
[184:15.12]On stream.
[184:15.72]On stream.
[184:17.00]Very easily.
[184:17.76]It wasn't that difficult.
[184:19.16]It was kind of hard, but it wasn't like excruciatingly difficult.
[184:23.90]Sure, we were playing on normal, but this is expert.
[184:26.98]Why can't we should be able to do this?
[184:28.48]We're Twitch streamers.
[184:31.28]How about when I said to my mother?
[184:33.43]She's going to know I didn't fucking do it.
[184:36.18]Jeremy, you didn't... How are you already dead?
[184:38.80]I'm dead.
[184:40.50]In one hit.
[184:41.90]Against adversary.
[184:43.16]Adversary?
[184:44.06]What's the word?
[184:44.62]Adversary.
[184:45.81]Adversary?
[184:46.67]Adversary.
[184:47.55]No.
[184:48.01]Adversary.
[184:48.69]What's the word?
[184:49.19]Say it.
[184:50.63]When somebody's like against all odds.
[184:52.95]Adversary.
[184:53.55]No, no, no.
[184:54.15]Adversity.
[184:55.43]Adversity.
[184:55.89]Diversity.
[184:56.49]No.
[184:56.91]Adversity.
[184:57.39]The adpocalypse.
[185:00.79]Shut up, Jeremy.
[185:05.62]My mom's gonna be so mad that I didn't do this.
[185:09.11]Really, people paid you like $1500 last night and you couldn't fucking beat expert Cuphead with two people?
[185:15.51]Yeah, more than one.
[185:31.00]I'm absolutely above the legal limit.
[185:32.86]Like, there's no way.
[185:33.82]How are you?
[185:36.81]You gotta carry me.
[185:38.55]You have to carry me.
[185:40.58]That's not how this works.
[185:41.76]You gotta carry me.
[185:42.86]I can't carry you right now.
[185:45.14]Home field advantage, man.
[185:47.10]I can barely even write my name.
[185:49.80]You sound pretty all together to me.
[185:51.28]All together?
[185:51.82]Yeah, you sound pretty good.
[185:53.26]I sound all together.
[185:54.12]Chad, does he sound different than normal to you guys?
[185:56.07]Different than normal?
[185:56.83]He's pretty standard, I think.
[185:58.85]He's a high functioning.
[186:00.83]A high functioning drinker.
[186:04.16]Can you help me out with the bees?
[186:05.48]There.
[186:06.10]You happy?
[186:07.76]Not one point of damage, by the way.
[186:08.76]We're good.
[186:09.40]Keep it up.
[186:10.42]Don't jinx it.
[186:11.78]I'm doing ultimate.
[186:13.22]Okay.
[186:13.80]And I'm going to do it right after you.
[186:15.50]We've got to get out of this.
[186:19.95]I'm doing it.
[186:20.39]I'm doing it.
[186:21.13]Here I come.
[186:23.93]One more.
[186:24.43]One more Q. Here comes the gloves.
[186:26.59]It's just ducking and shit.
[186:29.39]We're good.
[186:30.19]Three HP each.
[186:31.37]This is the mark.
[186:35.09]We both thought that that was gonna out-distance it.
[186:37.65]It's alright, here it comes.
[186:38.89]Here it comes.
[186:39.37]2 HP each, we're fine.
[186:43.56]Alright, just be easy.
[186:45.38]I'll get the fucking... I'll pull the lever, okay?
[186:50.02]UGH!
[186:51.19]You made me...
[186:52.45]Why?!
[186:53.57]Because I was laughing at you.
[187:04.26]Please save me.
[187:04.70]Please save my life.
[187:05.34]Please, God.
[187:06.46]Okay.
[187:11.44]Easy.
[187:12.58]You have a super.
[187:13.16]I do.
[187:13.48]Use it here.
[187:13.98]Ready?
[187:14.19]All right.
[187:14.49]Three, two, one.
[187:15.47]Do it.
[187:19.33]That was the expected outcome.
[187:22.21]Super.
[187:26.63]Save me.
[187:31.74]The debt has been paid.
[187:36.88]You did it!
[187:37.52]That one was all you!
[187:38.60]I'm like pointing the finger and... This stream is going to go 24 hours if necessary to defeat the frog boss.
[187:54.33]Why?
[187:54.51]Let's do it with my controller!
[187:55.53]It started up, but my controller fucked up.
[188:00.76]Dude, you guys, you guys don't know.
[188:02.40]Like, honestly, let's be real.
[188:04.12]You guys have seen both of us have beaten this game on normal.
[188:06.51]Without, like, there were some problems.
[188:09.35]Expert and two players.
[188:11.85]And drunk.
[188:19.30]Let me try and fucking emphasize this.
[188:31.12]No way.
[188:32.68]Give us a break.
[188:35.41]Two fucking players?
[188:39.21]Do a field sobriety test?
[188:40.29]I would fail.
[188:43.97]Jesus Christ.
[188:48.25]You ready?
[188:50.03]You sure?
[188:50.57]I'm ready.
[188:51.23]Okay.
[188:51.49]I was ready last time and we almost won.
[188:53.03]Play the B level?
[188:55.33]No.
[188:56.07]We can't even do the fucking dumb shitty frog level.
[188:59.49]It's so easy.
[189:02.09]What an expert, you lose a touch.
[189:05.12]I'm not in the right spot.
[189:08.58]I'm not comfortable.
[189:12.30]Wow.
[189:13.22]Come on, shut up.
[189:16.34]Wow.
[189:19.17]How is that me?
[189:20.63]You just weren't in the right spot.
[189:21.69]I was holding down.
[189:23.81]How dare you?
[189:31.45]Save your super for the slot machine.
[189:33.67]No, save it.
[189:34.79]Next phase.
[189:35.63]Use it immediately next phase.
[189:37.55]You understand?
[189:39.63]Like, use it right... No.
[189:43.57]Done.
[189:43.89]Nice play.
[189:47.97]Oh, whoa!
[189:49.39]He started with the other phase.
[189:50.63]I'm going to use it.
[189:55.13]I have to.
[189:55.85]I have to.
[189:56.83]I have to.
[190:04.93]Here it comes.
[190:06.53]Here it comes.
[190:08.25]Easy.
[190:08.81]Just play it like you would fucking your grandmother's house.
[190:13.80]Play it like Neopets at your grandmother's house.
[190:19.42]Oh!
[190:23.58]What a bacon hero!
[190:24.74]What a hero.
[190:25.24]What a fucking hero.
[190:28.26]Sorry.
[190:29.28]Sorry, I can adapt.
[190:31.29]I can't.
[190:40.62]Ruined.
[190:42.70]Ruined it.
[190:49.49]Get over here.
[190:50.11]Get over here.
[190:50.65]Come on.
[190:51.03]Go.
[190:51.33]Get over here.
[190:52.25]Come on.
[190:53.35]Go.
[190:53.63]Go.
[190:53.97]We gotta go.
[190:55.11]Go.
[190:55.45]Go.
[190:55.79]Just go.
[190:56.29]Go.
[190:56.63]Just get over here.
[190:58.37]We gotta get that out of my mind because I am about to have a meltdown.
[191:01.93]I have a mental breakdown.
[191:03.53]Maybe we should do it once on normal.
[191:05.27]No.
[191:05.69]No.
[191:07.23]No normal.
[191:08.67]Only expert.
[191:09.98]Just move out of the way here.
[191:11.52]Why are we going to world two?
[191:13.00]Because I can't fucking, I can't even do it.
[191:14.68]We're going to world two?
[191:16.74]Just fucking play.
[191:18.06]Forget it.
[191:19.00]I lost my audio.
[191:20.86]It's too late.
[191:21.34]My audio's out.
[191:22.10]I gotta play without audio.
[191:23.16]Why would we play Genie Flying Level?
[191:25.35]I beat this on the fucking first try.
[191:26.93]Easy.
[191:27.71]It's not that hard.
[191:28.45]Just fucking be good.
[191:29.33]This one, like, I really struggled on.
[191:33.83]That fucking troll face laughing at me.
[191:36.85]I don't have any goddamn audio.
[191:48.46]He's got audio now, people.
[191:49.84]Got audio now.
[191:58.91]Oh, it's on.
[192:02.87]Dodge if you have to.
[192:07.60]Excellent.
[192:08.40]That was fucking excellent.
[192:10.72]Do more of that.
[192:15.56]Excellent!
[192:19.52]Have you had that already?
[192:20.36]Oh, you've been, uh... It's been too good.
[192:21.87]Alright, we gotta focus.
[192:25.27]Up, up, up, up.
[192:29.36]Okay, I didn't even know what character I was.
[192:51.46]Come on, James.
[192:54.72]Come on, James.
[192:56.14]Come on, James.
[192:57.54]How do I get back in?
[192:58.48]James would do it.
[193:00.58]You can't get back in.
[193:02.20]Let me back in.
[193:08.72]Jim would do it.
[193:12.97]It's too hard.
[193:14.03]It's not even past the second phase.
[193:15.37]It's too hard on expert with two people.
[193:17.09]It's not possible.
[193:17.73]It's not possible.
[193:18.39]I don't think it's possible with two people on expert.
[193:27.59]Get James.
[193:29.58]Get James.
[193:31.34]Let's do the B level.
[193:32.18]Are you serious?
[193:35.04]Let's just jump straight into it.
[193:36.72]Why would you want to do that?
[193:37.46]Because we're already losing, so what's the difference?
[193:40.58]Start it over.
[193:42.62]We may as well do one that's hard so that when we lose, we can say there's a reason for it instead of just losing on the blue slime.
[193:50.07]We shouldn't have even drank alcohol.
[193:51.67]What a mistake.
[193:56.17]It's going to be really good.
[193:58.69]Just stay little the whole time.
[194:00.39]Who cares?
[194:01.25]What if you can't shoot?
[194:02.47]Just get him.
[194:09.89]Alright.
[194:13.05]And I even hit the wrong spot in the fucking wall.
[194:21.77]Don't buy this game!
[194:22.73]It's bad!
[194:32.25]Please.
[194:33.41]Please.
[194:37.47]Let's go to the B level.
[194:39.37]We're going to the B level.
[194:41.09]Alright, let me switch gear first.
[194:44.86]How do you do that?
[194:45.68]Pick Lobber.
[195:10.21]Okay.
[195:11.85]But that, hang on.
[195:16.37]You good?
[195:16.77]Yeah, I didn't know if pushing B confirmed or just went back, so I wanted to make sure it confirmed it.
[195:22.37]I'm ready.
[195:22.81]Oh boy.
[195:30.37]Where is the B level?
[195:31.21]Is it in this world?
[195:34.75]You okay there, bud?
[195:35.91]You good?
[195:44.74]Is this the B level?
[195:45.54]Let's warm up.
[195:46.90]You're up.
[195:47.38]Warm up.
[195:47.58]Doesn't look like the B level.
[195:53.18]Get out.
[195:54.70]Not the upside down world.
[195:55.98]Not the upside down.
[196:01.15]Get out.
[196:04.59]My Uber is not here yet.
[196:06.51]He's not leaving, by the way.
[196:08.37]He's here forever.
[196:10.12]He's here for a long time.
[196:11.52]This is the B level.
[196:13.68]Honeycomb Herald.
[196:15.23]I'm ready.
[196:16.09]I beat this one faster than you.
[196:17.29]Yeah, I beat this one faster.
[196:18.95]This game fucking is terrible.
[196:52.75]We almost made it past the first phase on the first try.
[197:02.62]It's pretty good.
[197:08.84]What the fuck are we thinking right now?
[197:11.09]Why are we doing this?
[197:13.69]We could have been playing obscure.
[197:14.75]We could have been solving puzzles.
[197:17.63]You want an expert Cuphead two-player?
[197:22.83]I'm sorry, but nobody fucking does this.
[197:26.85]Who does this?
[197:27.41]Who did this?
[197:28.93]We could be the world first.
[197:30.11]Are we the world first?
[197:30.97]I don't even know what my character is.
[197:34.07]People play this game on simple and they have trouble.
[197:39.24]We can't even get to the fucking B.
[197:45.80]colors are blending together.
[197:47.76]I'm just going to tell you right now.
[197:51.38]That blue was green.
[197:53.31]How are we dying at the same time?

[197:59.55]Buy it.
[197:59.87]It's a great game.
[198:00.43]It's a fucking fantastic game.
[198:01.77]Only on normal mode.
[198:03.57]Let's change the title. ...
[198:16.15]I'm gonna change this.
[198:20.32]What did you change it to?
[198:21.08]Oh.
[198:21.14]Okay.

[199:53.32]I don't fucking remember how to play.
[199:55.52]I don't even remember how to play the game.
[199:57.54]I don't remember how to play this game.
[199:59.32]I remember this part though.
[200:05.40]I do.
[200:05.56]I remember this part being easy.
[200:07.61]This fucking Woody Woodpecker had a bad day.
[200:12.93]It doesn't matter how drunk I am, I can fucking do this.
[200:18.57]This is a regular mode.
[200:20.59]Regular streamer.
[200:22.88]Beat the game in four and a half hours on stream.
[200:29.18]He pressed a button.
[200:30.64]He pressed a button.
[200:32.24]And, like, minimized the screen.
[200:34.10]And literally alt-tabbed me out of the game.
[200:41.96]Deny it.
[200:44.12]Deny that.
[200:45.30]I did not.
[200:48.68]Alt-tabbed me out of the game.
[200:58.14]Do it.
[200:58.68]This time.
[200:59.22]For real.
[201:01.26]You know how embarrassed this is gonna be?
[201:02.62]You know how embarrassing this is gonna be if we can't do this on normal?
[201:06.06]If we can't beat this on normal, do you know how embarrassing that's gonna be for my stream?
[201:10.95]Do it right.
[201:11.37]Alright?
[201:12.21]This is not expert.
[201:13.23]Do it right.
[201:15.19]What an embarrassment this would be if we can't do this.
[201:18.29]Expert's a joke.
[201:19.23]Expert's impossible.
[201:21.45]Not normal.
[201:27.90]Let's show these PLEBS!
[202:21.85]He's gonna carry that.
[202:25.21]Perfect fucking shot.
[202:28.49]Perfect shot.

[203:30.15]Okay, they shoot up, they shoot up.
[203:33.10]Easy.
[203:33.28]Little bit.

[204:07.18]I beat this.
[204:08.26]I beat this game.
[204:09.72]That boss was not that bad.
[204:11.22]He had trouble with this boss.
[204:12.52]No, I did not.
[204:13.36]This boss was easy.
[204:14.36]You had a lot of trouble with this boss from what I watched.
[204:17.04]No, it was the green dragon that I had trouble with.
[204:23.34]This boss was easy.
[204:25.52]I beat this game so fucking quickly.

[207:08.21]He may have.
[207:10.41]For the record.
[207:11.33]For the record, I... For the record.
[207:14.33]This is for the record.
[207:15.17]I think Dr. Disrespect is very funny.
[207:18.42]He's a very high-quality streamer.
[207:20.98]He's funny.
[207:22.84]Make sure we know that.
[207:26.24]He's a great guy, too.
[207:28.84]Literally, like, a stand-up, like, great fucking guy.
[207:31.82]He is.
[207:33.40]He's a great fucking guy.
[207:38.40]You beat this with me right now.

[207:42.43]Okay?
[207:42.85]Do we?
[207:43.55]Yeah.
[207:44.21]For now, look, there's an exploding egg.
[207:46.17]You win this game right now.
[207:49.47]Okay.
[207:50.03]Or I'm going to have a huge problem, okay?
[207:51.47]Okay.
[207:53.19]Don't get hit by the egg.
[207:54.05]That's exploding right there.
[207:55.26]This match will get red hot.
[208:02.96]You're up.
[208:04.30]Vinny had 93 deaths.
[208:05.42]I don't believe it.
[208:07.27]I had 113.
[208:07.53]I fucking swear to God, dude, don't ever play this game when you drink alcohol, ever.
[208:14.81]For any reason.
[208:16.19]I would rather fucking, like, literally... Don't say it.
[208:20.43]Don't say it.
[208:23.06]I was gonna say it.
[208:25.20]I know.
[208:26.08]I know what you were gonna say.
[208:27.66]What was I gonna say?
[208:28.64]I can't say it.
[208:35.52]We may as well start over.
[208:40.07]A brawl is surely brewing.
[208:41.75]I'm just going to spread my ass all over the camera and get banned forever.
[208:46.31]That's not what I thought you were going to say.
[208:49.47]I thought you were going to say something else.
[208:54.11]There's something possibly worse I thought you were going to say.
[208:57.12]A great slam and then stop.
[209:02.28]Drinking's not fun.
[209:03.21]Don't do it.
[209:04.19]It's fucking stupid.
[209:09.93]This is not an expert.
[209:11.41]We can easily beat this.
[209:13.46]Go from corner to corner when they shoot them in the corners.
[209:15.94]Yes.
[209:17.10]Until the little birdies come.
[209:18.22]This is fun.
[209:19.52]Then you have to kill the birdies.
[209:20.58]You have fun?
[209:21.81]Oh, yeah.
[209:23.15]This is fun.
[209:24.51]I'm having a great time.
[209:25.13]Don't kill him.
[209:25.73]It's worth it to get rid of the tricks.
[209:29.13]You're true.
[209:29.59]You're true.
[209:30.01]You're true.
[209:30.59]You are true.
[209:31.87]Get the stuff off the screen.
[209:34.78]Then you can focus on just dodging and doing damage.
[209:36.52]That's a good thought.
[209:38.08]Good thought.
[209:40.62]Fuck the parries.
[209:42.58]Just hurry up.
[209:43.28]Space tip.
[209:44.66]I am going to do the bomb.
[209:46.86]Shut your fucking mouth.
[209:49.72]This is so easy to dodge.
[209:53.53]Don't fucking get yourself fucked up for me Is he?
[210:18.72]Basically.
[210:22.52]No, this is base two.
[210:23.28]Can you go?
[210:30.27]It's too close.
[210:46.60]Nice work.
[210:48.82]Clean.
[210:49.50]Really fucking clean.
[210:52.32]Really clean.
[210:56.28]Nice work.
[210:59.38]Excellent fucking work.
[211:02.06]Okay, switch the bombs.
[211:17.05]Easy?
[211:17.15]Stay, like, in the... I don't know where to stay.
[211:20.71]Right in the... I don't know where to... Fuck it.
[211:27.30]Fuck it.
[211:28.16]Yeah.
[211:28.90]Yeah.
[211:29.88]Yeah.
[211:46.24]Can Doctor Disrespect do that?
[211:53.59]Save.
[211:55.37]Save it.
[211:56.83]Let's be real.
[211:57.91]He's a fucking great guy.
[212:03.27]No longer embarrassed on stream.
[212:04.85]There, we beat a regular boss.
[212:06.87]We went in.
[212:07.39]Only took like seven retries.
[212:09.84]He's a great guy.
[212:15.54]He's talking about me, not Dr. Dishersville.
[212:18.24]He's a great, he's a fucking great guy.
[212:19.62]He's been around for 10 years.
[212:20.52]He's a fucking fantastic person.
[212:22.30]We have known each other a long time.
[212:23.90]I don't know him at all, actually.
[212:25.30]Not at all.
[212:27.34]He's a very funny, very high quality streamer.
[212:29.48]You should follow him.
[212:31.53]He's a great fucking person.
[212:37.09]Why does he keep saying he's a great guy?
[212:38.89]I think they're talking about me.
[212:40.85]Expert.
[212:41.33]He's talking about me.
[212:46.00]Oh, why'd you do go to the green dragon?
[212:48.11]After I just won the game for us.
[212:50.83]And we're playing with the lob shot.
[212:52.81]You're good.
[212:53.15]This is what you want.
[212:55.51]You can't handle it, then fucking get out of the kitchen, man.
[212:57.47]I can't.
[212:58.83]This is my weakness.
[213:00.33]You can't take the kitchen?
[213:01.23]Get out of the kitchen.
[213:03.55]Still at 3 HP.
[213:03.91]Come on.
[213:04.31]I got you, don't I?
[213:26.18]Who died first?
[213:29.28]Who died first?
[213:35.14]Who died first?
[213:35.98]Here's a real high-class bow.
[213:46.93]I want everyone to be well aware they're not already.
[213:49.21]We are trying so hard right now.
[213:56.83]To have a good time.
[213:57.91]I can't.
[214:00.55]We should just play some videos.
[214:01.83]Because I can't even fucking see.
[214:03.91]This is not good.
[214:05.87]I don't even know what's happening.
[214:07.19]Why would we play expert when we've been drinking?
[214:09.05]What's the point of this?
[214:11.57]Okay.
[214:12.37]Why didn't we stop while we were ahead?
[214:14.05]What's the point of doing this when you've been drinking playing on expert?
[214:16.95]Did you switch back to expert?
[214:18.57]Yes.
[214:19.19]Oh.
[214:20.11]I thought that was normal.
[214:21.21]No.
[214:21.75]Oh, I felt way worse than I should have.
[214:29.45]Get it together.
[214:31.39]Wait, we're going back in?
[214:32.17]Mm-hmm.
[214:33.47]We're going back in.
[214:35.76]We're going back in one more time.
[214:57.51]We're going back in one more time.
[215:00.32]Look at the tail.
[215:06.62]What?
[215:07.30]What's going on?
[215:08.42]Where are you?
[215:10.30]Where'd you go?
[215:10.86]I don't know.
[215:16.19]I don't.
[215:16.55]I will show you.
[215:18.87]Taste it.
[215:21.93]Watch out, they jump up.
[215:31.07]And I got fucking hit by the guy.
[215:38.33]Where's my dash?
[215:39.11]Where's my fucking... Here we go.
[215:39.93]Where are you?
[216:12.44]Pretty close, actually.
[216:13.72]This is on... Are you sure this is on... You're lying.
[216:16.11]This is on regular.
[216:17.11]This is definitely normal, by the way.
[216:24.39]He's a great guy.
[216:25.84]It's ecliptic.
[216:32.30]Why would you choose it to expert?
[216:39.69]Hope you're ready.
[216:45.75]Jesus Christ.
[216:47.51]Dude, you have to be on like cocaine to beat this.
[216:50.43]Fucking sober and on coke to beat this on expert with two people.
[216:55.34]It's not possible with two people on expert.
[216:57.86]It's fucking impossible.
[216:59.66]It's impossible.
[217:03.46]You have to be on drugs to beat this with two people.
[217:06.72]You have to be on drugs.
[217:12.05]What fucking fucked up drugs do you have to be on to do this?
[217:18.61]You have to be able to eat like fucking shit to do this.
[217:21.71]You have to eat actual dog poop.
[217:23.75]Covered in cocaine.
[217:29.26]I saved you!
[217:30.97]I quit the fucking game.
[217:31.65]I don't care.
[217:33.55]I'm opening the fucking goddamn Zimfinis.
[217:35.45]Fuck that impossible goddamn game.
[217:41.22]It's over.
[217:42.40]It's over.
[217:43.16]Maximum overload.
[217:45.10]The game is not physically possible on Expert with two people.
[217:48.38]It's not possible.
[217:50.19]Good luck.
[218:09.83]This is a keyboard game.
[218:11.61]It's a keyboard game.
[218:12.32]Okay.
[218:13.02]Let's see.
[218:17.08]You have apparently beaten the game.
[218:18.36]Okay.
[218:19.72]Is that on?
[218:20.28]Did you beat it on very, very hard?
[218:21.92]Let's see how good you are.
[218:22.92]What?
[218:24.14]Go ahead.
[218:26.44]Did you just put me into the hardest level in the game on expert mode?
[218:29.40]Let's do it.
[218:34.96]Uh...
[218:39.53]Excuse me.
[219:32.04]But they're all dead.
[219:33.82]There's only three left.
[219:34.90]Aren't they supposed to land somewhere to safety?
[219:40.24]Fine.
[219:41.44]You only have to get one across?
[219:54.63]That's it.
[220:01.22]I win.
[220:01.56]Okay.
[220:02.44]Good luck with this one.
[220:07.36]Oh, come on, pizza.
[220:09.81]You know I love you.
[220:12.01]I'm going to make the right pizza.
[220:14.27]I do love pizza.
[220:20.40]So you have to make a pizza that they'll eat.
[220:22.18]They're here.
[220:23.34]Good luck.
[220:23.70]You're going to fucking need it.
[220:25.54]What are these?
[220:27.12]Those are what they don't like.
[220:28.56]Okay.
[220:29.28]Good luck.
[220:29.60]I'm going to pee.
[220:30.48]So we already know.
[220:31.45]So, okay.
[220:35.17]Obviously everyone likes pineapple.
[220:37.05]Good luck.
[220:38.27]How do you like...
[220:47.16]Okay.
[220:48.30]More toppings.
[220:49.24]Uh-oh.
[220:52.76]Pineapple's good.
[220:54.31]Pineapple's good.
[220:55.25]More toppings.
[220:56.31]Okay.
[220:57.81]What do we think?
[221:00.91]Pineapple and, uh... Mushroom?
[221:09.11]How many more?
[221:11.29]This is your chance.
[221:13.01]Get away.
[221:16.46]So this is like the hardest mode.
[221:22.04]Listen.
[221:23.58]Listen here.
[221:24.42]Okay, this is my stream now.
[221:25.80]Alright.
[221:28.17]I can play whatever I want.
[221:31.09]Let's look in the old... I don't even know how to get to Steam on this computer, actually.
[221:36.15]So we're playing Zoombinis.
[221:37.73]Because I am not computer literate, apparently.
[221:44.11]There's only one door out of here.
[221:46.19]Okay.
[221:46.59]And he just went through it.
[221:47.75]So I can't just leave because he's waiting on the other side of the door.
[221:53.46]All right.
[221:54.62]Windows are locked.
[221:55.34]Okay.
[221:55.92]Think I haven't tried that already?
[221:57.62]I've already been there.
[221:58.46]I've already tried.
[221:59.70]It's not just your average little bolt.
[222:01.16]Okay.
[222:02.14]It's got a little bit more zest to it than the average window door.
[222:05.17]Okay.
[222:06.07]I've tried hiding in the closet until he's not paying attention and then busting out.
[222:08.81]I got caught twice doing that.
[222:13.80]He's definitely doing the, like, go outside the window scare jump right now.
[222:18.82]I guarantee it.
[222:20.54]I heard the door slide.
[222:22.65]You're gonna hear a loud noise soon.
[222:26.03]Maybe not.
[222:26.99]I can't tell.
[222:30.25]I really thought you were doing the outside the door.
[222:32.83]Wait, you told me to go outside, didn't you?
[222:35.28]Yeah, that's what it is.
[222:36.24]I figured it out already.
[222:39.71]Done.
[222:40.63]Spoiled.
[222:43.11]Nothing's happening.
[222:44.05]You think I don't know you?
[222:44.83]You think you could bring me into your house and I don't know?
[222:47.17]You've only done one attempt.
[222:48.79]I've done two, actually.
[222:51.61]Loud.
[222:52.47]You're loud.
[222:52.89]I thought you were going to do the first version of the joke.
[222:55.58]Bring it down a tad.
[222:58.24]Move over.
[222:58.56]She likes pineapples.
[223:06.66]And pepper.
[223:07.24]Can you go?
[223:07.76]Like, what the fuck are we waiting for?
[223:09.36]Back seaters.
[223:13.05]Just wait.
[223:13.43]Just wait.
[223:30.32]How many tips do you get in this?
[223:32.76]She likes pineapple.
[223:34.24]So the only thing I haven't tried is pepperoni and cheese.
[223:36.94]But she wants more toppings.
[223:38.92]There's only so many things you can do.
[223:44.89]Do one of each topping and then combine.
[223:46.67]That's a good idea.
[223:47.59]It's going back in.
[223:48.81]Did you get more?
[223:49.67]It's going back in.
[223:51.03]Is there more in there?
[223:52.07]Oh, you poured it back in.
[223:52.79]Gee, I wasn't expecting that one.
[224:02.01]Watch this.
[224:06.27]Do they want the same thing every time you play?
[224:08.79]I just did it.
[224:09.19]I won.
[224:09.63]What's going on?
[224:14.08]I'll show you.
[224:37.75]I was about to open Family Guy back to the multiverse again.
[224:43.70]I think that's going to be the end of the stream.
[224:47.04]That's the end of the stream!
[224:48.48]What, four hours?
[224:50.51]It's been pretty fun.
[224:51.29]What a finale.
[224:52.05]What a finale.
[224:54.65]The long story is, don't drink and play Cuphead Expert with your friend.
[224:58.41]You're never going to win.
[225:00.29]Even when you do win, you don't win.
[225:01.96]Even when you win, you lose.
[225:04.99]Uh, let's see here.
[225:05.95]So is there really no, like, scare joke?
[225:08.45]Scare?
[225:17.06]No.
[225:17.34]Uh, there's no scare.
[225:19.40]Not even four hours?
[225:20.34]Hey!
[225:20.42]Let me look at this.
[225:24.98]Hold on one sec.
[225:29.16]That's a lot of fucking bits.
[225:30.88]Jesus Christ.
[225:35.74]Incoming scare.
[225:36.90]Arm wrestle italics?
[225:37.99]Fine.
[225:38.19]Right there.
[225:41.53]You ready?
[225:45.59]One, two, three.
[225:57.51]I'm on wheels.
[225:58.41]This don't count.
[225:59.17]He's on wheels.
[226:01.92]Let's get it right.
[226:02.62]Ready?
[226:03.84]One.
[226:04.08]He's got the foundation.
[226:05.74]One, two, three.
[226:12.41]It's a tie.
[226:13.55]It's a tie.
[226:16.05]It's a tie.
[226:16.93]I'm on wheels.
[226:18.61]Get it.
[226:23.08]This fucking setup is like... I'm on wheels, guys.
[226:27.44]Look at this.
[226:28.98]He's not on wheels.
[226:30.48]I'm in a camping chair, inexplicably.
[226:32.45]Alright, ready?
[226:33.35]We just did it.
[226:34.19]My arm hurts.
[226:34.97]One, two, three.
[226:35.75]I win.
[226:36.59]Fucking best in the world.
[226:37.97]Hey, thanks for watching.
[226:44.09]Yeah, it was fun.
[226:49.34]I'm not sure what happened on this stream, but apparently something happened.
[226:53.78]The first half of it is a blur.
[226:55.98]It is.
[226:57.12]But that's okay.
[226:58.44]I think there was some cheese and crackers involved.
[227:00.76]There were some cheese and crackers and there were some other things involved.
[227:06.45]There were so many bits and so many subs.
[227:08.77]Holy shit, guys.
[227:13.32]There are so many I don't I can't even read them.
[227:16.16]There's so many you guys are so fucking spoiling to me I Don't even there's hundreds of them You guys are fucking out of this world.
[227:28.63]Holy shit Jesus you have to scroll like a hundred times to scroll so many times my god.
[227:35.35]Oh
[227:38.48]Uh, we'll start from here.

[227:41.80]Thank you, Ben.
[227:42.78]Thanks, Ben.
[227:43.34]Some serious collusion going on.

[229:47.27]Did we beat, like, anything?
[229:48.63]What did we do?
[229:49.67]We did beat one boss on regular in Cuphead.
[229:51.61]Did you guys like that?
[229:52.43]I think we beat two bosses on Cuphead.
[229:55.19]Didn't we beat the orb on Expert?
[229:58.93]Why is the camera over here?
[230:01.37]The camera's over here now.
[230:03.40]I'm not sure where to look.
[230:04.50]Did you guys like this stream?
[230:06.82]Did you?
[230:08.60]It was pretty good.
[230:09.66]Did you guys like this stream?
[230:11.10]I think part one was better than part two.
[230:13.96]I hope you did.
[230:15.92]Huh?
[230:16.56]Hmm?
[230:17.02]Did you?

[230:21.57]The first half.
[230:22.75]The first half.
[230:27.35]Part two was like an inevitability, though.
[230:30.01]Yeah, it was.
[230:30.75]Just because of how hard we went in part one.
[230:35.73]It was great till you had a meltdown.
[230:36.92]I have a meltdown every fucking stream.
[230:40.80]Part one was better.
[230:52.09]It was great until now.

[234:52.98]For real.
[234:54.50]I don't know what to say.
[234:57.16]It's hard to figure out what to say.
[234:58.72]Because I wish there was more I could say.
[235:00.42]I wish there was.
[235:01.16]For real.

[235:50.36]What was everyone's favorite part, and why was it family guy I?
[235:58.32]That pays for the plane ticket?
[236:00.69]His plane ticket was like $140.
[236:03.05]It wasn't that much money.
[236:03.91]It was really cheap.
[236:07.47]Thank you, everybody.
[236:08.25]You guys are fucking incredible.
[236:09.21]Almost to God.
[236:13.38]I think I didn't miss down here.
[236:15.84]Milarkey, thanks for the $1.
[236:17.12]This was a $100 donation, but it went down $1 for each hour italics waited at the airport.
[236:22.05]It's fair.
[236:22.69]It's fair.
[236:24.74]Clink 180.
[236:25.46]Thanks for the $1.
[236:27.04]Germa, I don't know if you saw my earlier message, but I need life advice.
[236:30.28]Uh-oh.
[236:31.84]Let's find it.
[236:33.82]Let's find... Let's find Clink's message.
[236:39.61]Where is it?
[236:41.19]Where is it?
[236:44.67]There it is.
[236:45.87]Hey, Germa.
[236:46.97]Two Mormons came to my door today and now they're coming back on Saturday to teach me about their religion.
[236:52.27]How do I give them the slip?
[236:55.99]Don't answer your door.
[236:58.09]Right?
[236:58.67]Yeah.
[236:59.35]Or you answer the door and you just firmly say, but gently, go away, please.
[237:03.94]Just don't answer the door.
[237:05.02]And then you shut the door.
[237:06.18]Because if they come in, they're trespassing, and then you can call the police.
[237:08.48]Just don't even answer the door.
[237:10.50]Just answer the door and be like, I'm sorry, I'm not interested in your fucking religion.
[237:13.94]Sorry.
[237:14.99]It's pretty easy.
[237:15.89]Just be like, I don't care.
[237:17.09]And then you can call the police.
[237:20.30]Oh, but thank you so much, everybody.
[237:21.98]There's like a bunch of other donations and stuff, but it's... I hope I didn't miss that many people.
[237:28.30]There was a lot of fucking donations tonight.
[237:32.22]Screech like a pterodactyl.
[237:34.56]That's a good one.
[237:37.16]For the most part, though, I think... Reaper, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[237:41.28]Here's some money to the short streamer Enrico Gervais.
[237:45.69]Gervais.
[237:46.81]It's Gervais.
[237:49.51]Is it, though?
[237:50.21]Yes, it is.
[237:52.17]Where's the camera?
[237:56.69]There it is.

[240:27.72]It's gone.
[240:28.70]I can't get that.
