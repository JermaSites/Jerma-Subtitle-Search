[93:15.00]It's one of the most popular ones.
[93:16.64]I'm just going to type distance until I get it.
[93:26.11]Not that one.
[93:40.58]Not that one.
[93:44.97]Come on, it's gotta be one of those popular ones.
[93:56.72]And feel like I belong.
[94:00.54]Alright, give up.
[94:01.98]Way.
[94:02.48]I can go the distance.
[94:07.05]I'll be there someday.
[94:10.95]If I can be strong I know every mile will be worth my while I would go most anywhere to feel like I belong I cry every single fucking time that happens in that movie I cry every time
[94:42.45]I literally cry every time.
[94:46.49]Yeah, I do.
[94:53.45]Oh, literally, guys.
[94:54.47]Literally.
[94:54.89]I literally cry.
[94:55.68]I literally cry.
[95:01.76]By the way, there are people just hitting, like, fucking home runs over here.
[95:06.08]This has been here the whole time.
[95:08.52]It's just the same, like, I keep seeing guys hit, like, fucking grand slams.
[95:23.21]Look, they're just hitting bombs!
[95:41.27]I'm interested in this now
[95:49.62]What a perfect fucking song for this.
[95:51.88]Don't you think?
[96:16.72]What is going on here?
[96:20.98]This is, oh, this is cricket.
[96:24.86]Oh, it's cricket.
[96:25.92]I was wondering, I was like, these guys are doing double crow hops at the mound.
[96:30.41]Oh, holy shit.
[96:32.77]Well, what is this?
[96:36.35]You know, I feel like I would love cricket.
[96:42.20]Isn't cricket, it's just like somebody hits the ball and they just sprint around like a circle.
[96:48.68]You throw the ball as fucking hard as you can.
[96:51.12]And you have to hit the ball and then run back and forth over and over again.
[96:53.95]I feel like I would probably like it.
[97:02.17]But that's just been going on this whole time.
[97:04.75]It's like the only thing I've been seeing.
[97:07.67]Holy shit, that- what- wow.
[97:11.43]That was almost a strike.
[97:16.42]Okay, um, what the hell are we doing now?
[97:30.80]You know that intro video that plays at, uh, the thing that just loops in every hotel room?
[97:40.43]Like, I'm getting, it's just like a big loop over and over again.
[97:42.75]And you just, like, you never turn it off.
[97:51.46]Okay, that's better.
[97:57.20]Alright, so now, where are we going?
[97:59.90]Where are we going from here?
[98:02.47]I'm not doing Five Nights at Freddy's.
[98:03.75]I'll do another couple quizzes.
[98:06.70]What about Puzzle?
[98:10.70]Country Trivia Logic Puzzle.
[98:18.22]Why are these the two most popular on the whole site?
[98:24.14]Harry Potter and Country Trivia.
[98:28.84]What's this one?
[98:34.60]No, I can't do that.
[98:46.30]Figure out the lyrics.
[98:47.28]There's so many lyrics.
[98:48.50]Finish the Christmas song.
[98:49.82]Ooh, I like this one.

[99:18.26]It's the most wonderful time of the year.
[99:22.03]Should we play Christmas music?
[99:24.73]I know I like song ones.
[99:26.19]Sorry.
[99:26.51]Oh, this one sucks.
[99:28.75]Never mind.
[99:29.03]I don't want to do it anymore.
[99:31.25]What's another good one?
[99:37.84]Halloween, Christmas, holiday songs, Thanksgiving.
[99:43.56]What should I do?
[99:44.97]Just pick a popular one?
[99:50.65]This quiz doesn't suck.
[99:52.84]I don't want to think of Christmas right now.
[99:54.38]It's too early.
[100:12.76]It's like Dasher.
[100:18.20]I wonder what's going on over here.
[100:22.10]I don't know.

[111:12.58]Guys, if all the lights in my house were off, I would still have trouble finding out where the fuck I was.
[111:17.74]How many times have you been in, okay, the house that you've lived in, even if you've been there for a full decade, doesn't matter.
[111:24.03]If you, it doesn't matter, you know where the things are, but you still have to go like this on the wall to where the light switch is, okay?
[111:30.83]Sorry.
[111:36.28]That was bad.
[111:46.47]You got to fill out the outside first.
[111:47.91]It's the only way you can do it.

[124:22.63]What is that?
[124:24.32]Sweet potato?
[124:29.84]That's a sweet potato.
[124:42.86]Could some of these be ice cream?
[124:45.37]Is that possible?
[124:47.15]Is it possible for some of these to be ice cream?
[124:58.23]Looks like soap.

[125:06.06]No, where's the starfruit?
[125:06.96]Oh, we should blink.
[125:11.06]So I can see.
[125:25.37]Celery.
[125:29.07]I'm guessing them correct, but they're not the ones that I'm looking at.
[125:37.72]I swear this is lettuce.
[125:38.92]This is romaine lettuce or butter lettuce or... It has to be lettuce.
[125:43.34]What else could that possibly be?
[126:14.28]Carrot.
[126:16.77]Yep, there it is.

[126:32.58]There's like five things on the board.
[126:35.06]Okay, cool.
[126:39.04]Onion, a green onion?
[126:42.37]There's a regular onion.
[126:43.23]Okay.
[126:54.65]I can't even do that sound if I wanted to.
[126:57.21]That just kind of happened.
[127:02.05]I was so focused and just, that just happened.
[127:12.90]That's not, that looks like coconut, doesn't it?
[127:18.14]I would say that's coconut, but I guess I'm wrong.
[127:26.65]Well, these are definitely fish.
[127:28.09]So let's just say tuna, salmon, like bass, right?
[127:33.48]Yep.
[127:36.14]Uh, cod, uh, halibut, uh, haddock, um, sablefish.
[127:52.36]I didn't type that.
[127:55.38]Wait, that's just, that's another word for it.
[127:57.88]Okay.
[127:58.54]What about swordfish?
[128:00.04]I feel like, I think one of those is swordfish.
[128:01.58]No.
[128:21.96]What kind of meat is that?
[128:23.82]It's not pork.
[128:25.10]Chicken?
[128:27.54]No, chicken's some... Where is chicken?
[128:31.90]What meat is this?
[128:34.64]Like lamb?
[128:35.34]No, I don't know.
[128:39.54]Maybe that... Is that fish?
[128:40.83]That's probably fish, right?
[128:41.95]That's gotta be fish.
[128:43.19]It has to be some kind of fish.
[128:47.49]Where's the music?
[128:48.15]That's a good idea.
[128:48.61]You're right.
[128:49.15]Sorry about that.
[128:50.75]Yeah, there should be music here.
[129:01.42]Okay.
[129:12.68]There's definitely cheeses here, right?
[129:14.21]Let's just say like Swiss cheese.
[129:15.65]No.
[129:21.81]No lettuce and no...
[129:38.44]Oh, that's a mango.
[129:41.68]Okay.
[129:45.43]I was gonna say mango or one of the other fruits like that.
[129:53.85]Oh, a lime!
[129:55.09]I'm not gonna get lime?
[129:57.37]That's ridiculous.
[129:58.65]Then with lemons here too then.
[130:00.53]So where's lemon?
[130:04.07]Yeah.
[130:04.63]How did I pass over lemon and lime?
[130:11.80]That's like a pencil sharpener.
[130:50.71]I'm kinda stumped.
[131:04.96]How could you forget the radish?
[131:27.24]I don't know what meat this is.
[131:29.56]It's not beef.
[131:30.08]It's not... Wait, it's turkey.
[131:32.80]It's not turkey?
[131:33.94]Shit.
[131:34.46]Okay, never mind.
[131:34.99]I'm wrong.
[131:35.29]Completely.
[131:36.25]Completely.
[131:54.58]What is this rock?
[131:55.58]This is just cave moss.
[132:08.41]What has, like, these weird eggs in it?
[132:12.01]Pomegranate has the weird eggs.
[132:14.23]What else has weird eggs in it?
[132:21.23]See, this has weird eggs in it.
[132:22.53]This has weird eggs in it.
[132:27.47]This is some kind of cabbage.
[132:34.44]Oh shit, I'm out of time.
[132:37.76]So what was it?
[132:40.60]What is endive?
[132:45.14]Endive?
[132:45.98]Endive?
[132:47.42]What is that?
[132:49.48]Oh, an apple.
[132:50.40]Okay.
[132:51.96]Cauliflower.
[132:52.84]What about this one?
[132:53.32]Purple broccoli?
[132:54.15]Weird.
[132:55.66]Leek.
[132:56.76]Heart of palm.
[132:57.36]Mackerel.
[132:58.34]Trout.
[132:58.62]I was going to say trout.
[133:01.34]Potato.
[133:03.36]Broccoli.
[133:04.56]It was broccoli.
[133:06.72]You never see the inside of a piece of broccoli, though.
[133:11.18]You just eat it.
[133:12.74]You don't see the inside of broccoli.
[133:14.79]So that's why that one's confusing.
[133:19.73]Purple potato, yeah.
[133:25.10]Grapefruit.
[133:25.88]Wow, I thought grapefruit was a fish.
[133:32.30]Wow.
[133:35.98]Pear.
[133:37.70]Zucchini.
[133:40.37]Pumpkin.
[133:43.15]Ugh.
[133:46.65]Fucking gross.
[133:48.99]Alright, um...
[133:51.34]Let's do another one.
[133:52.80]How about one more?
[133:53.66]Yeah, there are two grapefruits.
[133:54.92]There's two of a couple things.
[133:55.70]There's two limes.
[133:57.02]There's two apples.
[133:59.21]There's two carrots, I think, right?
[134:03.13]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[134:04.17]What?
[134:07.01]He's a bit stupid.
[134:12.62]Three cauliflowers, yeah.
[134:15.50]I thought this was a fish.
[134:18.75]No, I didn't think that a grapefruit was a fish.
[134:20.94]I thought that that Minecraft block was a fish.
[134:30.56]Do you not know what an apple is?
[134:31.72]Yeah, but I don't really eat apples, guys.
[134:37.31]I eat radishes.
[134:37.97]I eat bananas.
[134:38.69]I eat watermelon.
[134:39.45]I eat dragon fruit.
[134:40.25]I have onions.
[134:45.27]I eat the fucking Boston mushrooms.
[134:48.16]Alright, what about some related ones?
[134:51.00]McDonald's or Burger King?
[134:52.17]Let's fucking destroy this one.
[134:56.58]Quarter pound with cheese, that's McDonald's.
[134:58.74]Filet-O-Fish, McDonald's.
[135:00.60]Alaskan fish sandwich, that's some weird shit that'd probably be at Burger King.
[135:04.60]Triple stacker, Burger King.
[135:06.40]Southern style crispy chicken sandwich, Burger King, ew.
[135:09.72]What?
[135:10.81]Onion rings, Burger King.
[135:11.77]Double croissantwich, Burger King.
[135:14.65]Tender grilled chicken sandwich, Burger King.

[135:25.93]McDonald's?
[135:30.07]Warm Oreo brownie sundae.
[135:31.69]That sounds incredible.
[135:32.59]Wherever this is, I'm going tonight.
[135:34.70]Just kidding.
[135:36.02]Grilled onion cheddar burger.
[135:39.74]Memphis barbecue pulled pork sandwich.
[135:44.14]The Morningstar veggie burgers was, I believe... Really?
[135:46.40]Really?
[135:49.10]Fruit and yogurt parfait.
[135:50.14]That's McDonald's.
[135:50.98]Whopper.
[135:51.42]Burger King.
[135:52.66]Bacon, egg, and cheese bagel.
[135:53.86]Don't they both have these?
[135:58.32]Premium bacon ranch salad with grilled chicken.
[136:01.76]That's a Burger King item.
[136:03.94]That's Burger King.
[136:05.16]Sweet potato fries.
[136:05.76]Burger King.
[136:06.32]Big Mac.
[136:06.84]McDonald's.
[136:09.32]There's some weird limited time item and menu shit on here.
[136:11.72]So, sorry.
[136:12.75]Didn't get it alright.
[136:17.15]Fast food restaurant hut.
[136:20.72]Can you pick the 25 highest selling quick serve restaurant chains?
[136:23.62]What do you mean?
[136:26.32]Oh, I mean, are there 25 on this list?
[136:32.75]Okay.
[136:33.49]It's definitely, we're the ones I just know.
[136:36.14]I'm out of time.
[136:36.60]Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle.
[136:40.68]Okay.
[136:42.62]Del Taco is not right.
[136:44.06]Why did I click that?
[136:44.88]Why would I ever click that?
[136:46.44]Domino's.
[136:47.58]Dunkin' Donuts.
[136:50.76]No, not Firehouse Subs.
[136:52.82]Jack in the Box.
[136:56.14]KFC.
[136:57.68]McDonald's, obviously.
[136:59.46]Pizza Hut.
[137:00.72]Taco Bell.
[137:01.46]Subway.
[137:02.96]Starbucks.
[137:05.88]Wendy's.
[137:06.48]Alright, this is where it gets hard.
[137:09.61]Some of these are just barely up there.
[137:12.88]And if I were to take a guess, I would say it's probably Arby's, Sonic.
[137:21.12]Highest selling.
[137:22.06]Highest selling.
[137:24.00]Five Guys?
[137:24.70]Nope.
[137:27.98]But this is kind of not fair.
[137:29.96]Because I feel like these are just the restaurants with the most amount of chains.
[137:34.22]Right?
[137:35.82]So if that's the case, then I'm going to have to go with something like this, right?
[137:40.39]Papa John's, Little Caesars.
[137:43.06]Popeye's.
[137:44.91]Panda Express.
[137:48.13]The rest of these are not everywhere.
[137:50.55]Probably this one, yep.
[137:55.27]Probably Dairy Queen.
[137:55.94]There's only a few more.
[138:00.50]Definitely not In-N-Out.
[138:04.40]Timmy's?
[138:04.96]Tim Hortons?
[138:06.68]No.
[138:08.61]I don't have any more guesses.
[138:11.67]It's going to be one of these sandwich places like Jimmy John's.
[138:14.33]They're everywhere.
[138:16.06]But which one of these two guys named sandwich places?
[138:23.96]It's not In-N-Out.
[138:24.96]It can't be.
[138:26.80]They're not.
[138:27.74]They're in a very limited market.
[138:31.52]Panera?
[138:32.38]Yeah.
[138:33.88]Did I run out of time?
[138:38.27]I didn't run out.
[138:38.79]Oh, did I get them all?
[138:39.75]Did I get them?
[138:40.47]I thought it was 25.
[138:42.97]Wait, what?
[138:46.99]What happened?
[138:48.52]Oh, I have no more guesses left.
[138:49.72]Okay.
[138:52.06]Well, I want to know the answers.
[139:01.43]Alright, it was Jimmy John's.
[139:04.47]Uh...
[139:09.43]Whataburger, really?
[139:10.45]And Zaxby's were the other ones.
[139:13.30]Okay.
[139:14.20]Whataburger?
[139:15.72]Oh, it showed you the answers.
[139:16.60]Oops.

[143:17.45]I want to cover that with a piece of paper.
[143:22.62]I remember my grandmother.
[143:26.45]It's what ruined everything.
[143:29.58]we're at the dinner table and it would be people everyone's eating and the thing some people eat lobster like like they've never eaten food it's like in their whole life like some people eat a lobster like it's literally the last thing they're ever going to eat in their entire life and they like what's in here oh and it's just like god damn it what are you doing oh there's some still in there
[144:01.77]And I just want I just I don't like it.
[144:03.53]I don't like it.
[144:04.11]I don't like it at all.
[144:09.24]And a lot of people that I have grew up around eight lobster like that.
[144:19.57]I remember when I was younger,
[144:21.78]It'd be like, oh, you don't like lobster?
[144:24.24]Oh, come on, Jeremy.
[144:26.06]It's lobster.
[144:27.06]You gotta like lobster.
[144:28.54]And I'd be like, I don't really like lobster.
[144:30.64]So I remember eating the little legs.
[144:33.94]I'd be like... Just the tiny little meat that was in the little legs.
[144:43.55]I would try it.
[144:45.87]I didn't like it.
[144:49.54]And that's it.
[144:50.34]And that's how I was like, yeah, see, I ate lobster.
[144:52.36]I'll tell you, the claw meat, you want to know how I know that I'm out of my god darn mind?
[145:03.26]You know how I know I'm out of my mind?
[145:06.27]I love king crab legs.
[145:09.79]King crab legs are delicious to me.
[145:12.13]They're amazing.
[145:12.81]I love king crab legs.
[145:13.93]I love crab legs.
[145:16.21]But
[145:18.08]Eating, like, ripping this thing in half and eating its, like, fucking stomach.
[145:23.07]I can't do it.
[145:25.23]I'm on the clock, it's alright.
[145:30.97]I don't know what it's called, and I'm sorry if any of you are eating right now, but let me just preface this by saying I don't know what this is, but it's gross.
[145:38.80]There is a substance inside of a lobster.
[145:42.06]And...
[145:46.10]I'm telling you right now, this is kind of disgusting, so mute.
[145:48.36]I'm serious.
[145:50.17]There is this stuff inside of a lobster.
[145:53.47]It's this weird, like, green shit.
[146:01.69]Yep.
[146:05.15]It's the green shit.
[146:11.68]I used to watch people eat that.
[146:13.44]And I would go, what is that?
[146:14.98]And why are you eating it?
[146:26.47]I know that's the best part oh yeah I can't I don't I'm sorry but I used to watch spoonfuls of that go into my grandmother's mouth like what what is she eating this is traumatized yeah man I can't eat lobster
[147:00.02]And, but I can eat crab.
[147:03.64]That's the liver and pancreas.
[147:07.47]Okay, I can, look, if you gave me a lobster roll and you said, hey, here's a lobster roll.
[147:13.35]It's got claw.
[147:14.35]Yeah, it's got claw meat.
[147:15.13]It's got tail meat and it's been chopped up.
[147:17.25]It's been washed.
[147:18.19]We've been, you know, rinsed it, whatever.
[147:19.29]And it's cleaned.
[147:20.37]It's been buttered.
[147:21.09]And here you go.
[147:21.75]And it's chopped up and it's ready.
[147:22.71]Here you go.
[147:23.67]I would, I would eat it.
[147:24.31]I'd be like, okay, this is fine.
[147:26.14]This is, this is fine to me.
[147:28.42]But the... There's something about man going like this and just... Yeah!
[147:36.51]I can't do it.
[147:40.55]Scroll down.
[147:46.27]I like... Okay, claw meat.
[147:49.42]I've eaten it.
[147:50.12]I eat it.
[147:50.92]I've had it before.
[147:53.76]But I don't know.
[147:54.70]It freaks me out.
[147:58.60]Tearing apart an animal and eating its organs like a slurpee.
[148:03.15]Yes, I do not like that.
[148:06.05]I am not particularly into that.
[148:09.29]Yes.
[148:14.80]How do you feel about clams?
[148:16.12]I feel the same way about oysters, too.
[148:17.80]Like, what the fuck, man?
[148:19.54]Oh, they're so delicious.
[148:22.33]but it's just the oh yeah yeah give me give me give me give me that knife yeah pry it open and then and it's just like an old lady eating peaches I don't oh no no you put that in a chowder I'll eat a clam chowder but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna suck this thing up and suck up all the shit that's in it I'm not gonna suck his whole body up
[148:56.47]You, like, clean it, you know, take it out, cut off the pieces that you need, take the, you know, the part, the parts that, you know, are not gross to me.
[149:08.02]Because, honestly, I don't know what's in, I don't know, man.
[149:10.64]It's weird to me.
[149:14.90]You dislike chowder?
[149:15.80]No, I will eat clam chowder, and I'll be like, that was delicious, that was very good.
[149:20.42]But I don't want to open the clam and drink all of its fluids and its body and inhale it and swallow it as fast as I can.
[149:30.35]I don't like to eat my food like taking shots of alcohol.
[149:35.63]I just don't.
[149:36.58]And maybe that makes me a weird guy.
[149:43.45]And I've always... Oh, hey, hey.
[149:45.19]Hey.
[149:46.45]Hey, just put some Tabasco on it.
[149:48.37]You'll like it.
[149:48.91]You like Tabasco.
[149:49.93]You should do it.
[149:51.89]I like Tabasco.
[149:53.25]I don't like inhaling a whole animal in one second.
[149:57.62]I... I don't like breathing in an entire animal in all of its fluids.
[150:10.51]You ever done a raw egg shot?
[150:12.19]No.
[150:12.39]No.
[150:17.58]You're showing free advertising for oranges?
[150:20.30]What do you mean oranges?
[150:23.53]What are you talking about?
[150:30.17]Oh, wait, whatever that is.
[150:37.04]You are a chicken.
[150:38.08]You are a chicken.
[150:40.12]I'm just very particular about food.
[150:49.65]But I only like crab legs, and I don't like to eat it that often.
[150:54.73]Do a lobster review?
[150:56.52]No, because I don't want to... Okay, why do you not eat lobster?
[150:59.96]Because there's only one part of a lobster that I like.
[151:03.80]And I'm not going to buy a lobster to just eat its palms and not eat the rest of it.
[151:12.92]Lobsters, number one, are expensive.
[151:14.56]And number two, I'm not going to buy and eat this thing to eat 20% of its body.
[151:23.87]I don't want to do that when all the rest of it is edible and you can eat it.
[151:32.81]Now, if somebody has lobster or crab, or they're like, hey, look, I've got a lobster.
[151:38.24]Would you like a claw?
[151:39.74]Sure.
[151:40.80]Serve it up.
[151:41.70]Put some butter on it.
[151:47.04]What about a whole chicken?
[151:50.36]Yeah, I don't... I mean, I can do that, but I don't like to do that either.
[151:55.97]Now that I think about it.
[151:57.97]I... I think it's a little different, though, because this thing... This is going to be bad, I know.
[152:06.61]But a lobster... No, no.
[152:11.50]Yeah, that's the difference.
[152:13.46]This is... It's...
[152:16.89]You're losing followers?
[152:18.15]No, I'm not.
[152:18.69]I almost hit a goddamn million.
[152:22.65]Did you see that?
[152:26.68]This is 993,000 followers.
[152:28.16]We're close to a million here.
[152:29.08]And when I say we, I mean, of course, me.
[152:37.76]Lobsters are functionally immortal.
[152:40.28]Well, that's insane.
[152:41.66]Why are we eating an immortal being?
[152:44.36]Shouldn't we be trying to get their knowledge?
[152:48.52]Omeglel, okay, dude.
[152:49.72]How do you feel about shrimp?
[152:59.28]They're also weird.
[153:10.86]No, I need this internet to work.
[153:12.36]Come on.
[153:15.56]I need, come on.
[153:16.57]Stop.
[153:17.01]I want the internet to work.
[153:22.28]um I like fish but shellfish has just always been a little weird for me big shrimp's gonna take you down this was a four out of ten rant this is not a rant this is me telling you how I feel about the food
[153:49.50]Is that a rant?
[153:51.14]Or is it just me talking about how I eat?
[153:55.80]Your opinion on Greek food.
[153:56.98]I love Greek food.
[153:58.50]Mediterranean food is literally number one or number two.
[154:04.20]I'd say it's up there.
[154:05.70]Probably number two.
[154:10.92]Here's my tier list.
[154:14.19]Mexicans, number one.
[154:16.52]After Mexican, you got Mediterranean and Italian that are kind of close.
[154:21.41]And then everything else.
[154:27.99]What would you order at a Greek restaurant?
[154:32.09]There's lots of things I would order at a Greek restaurant.
[154:35.61]One of my favorite things in the world is just like a chicken shish kebab.
[154:41.55]It's so good.
[154:44.29]Chicken... Oh, my God.
[154:45.32]Chicken shawarma.
[154:46.22]That's another one.
[154:49.68]Chicken pita.
[154:50.60]Pita wraps.
[154:52.28]Euros.
[154:53.40]Oh, my goodness.
[154:54.56]With that tzatziki.
[154:57.43]Yeah.
[154:59.57]Thai food?
[155:00.05]I love Thai food.
[155:05.43]A good pad thai is up there, too.
[155:08.66]With that peanut sauce.
[155:10.16]Forget about it.
[155:20.13]Grape leaves.
[155:22.50]A good grape leaf.
[155:24.50]See you later.
[155:31.78]What about Indian food?
[155:35.36]Yeah.
[155:36.65]Butter chicken.
[155:38.01]Oh, see ya.
[155:41.69]Some of those good curries.
[155:42.81]Oh, hell yeah.
[155:53.28]I like a lot of different foods I just don't like a full like a lobster open it up and drink is the poop in his body I'm sorry I don't want to do that does that make me a little particular why are you always wait what do you say why do I always want
[156:21.14]Why are you leaving with the food all the time?
[156:23.86]Usually you can tell the stream is ending when we start talking about food, because that means I'm hungry.
[156:27.98]Because I probably haven't eaten in six to seven hours or so, maybe eight hours.
[156:32.09]So it's time for me to eat.
[156:34.11]That's how you can tell.
[156:41.54]Where are hot dogs for you?
[156:44.72]They're high, but they're not that high.
[156:47.43]I'm one of those weird motherfuckers that I will always eat a hot dog if it's available.
[156:52.86]Every time.
[156:53.26]I don't know why.
[156:54.70]If a hot dog is cooked, it's available, and it's on a tray, I will eat it.
[157:01.20]And I mean, even if there's other food items.
[157:03.82]Oh, hey, we've got this.
[157:04.95]Hey, we've got chicken salad.
[157:06.69]We've got chicken salad.
[157:08.27]And there's also a, we've got Greek salad over here too.
[157:12.05]I know you really like, we have some, some, there's quiche.
[157:17.18]And I literally just said that because it's right here and I couldn't think of another food.
[157:19.84]But if there was a hot dog as well.
[157:22.13]Oh yeah, we've got quiche, we've got lobster, we've got hot dogs, we've got pasta, chicken broccoli alfredo, and hot dogs.
[157:31.43]I'll always get one.
[157:35.27]I will always make room for one hot dog, and then I'll eat everything, eat the hot dog, and I'll go up for seconds.
[157:41.32]What do you think I'm getting for seconds?
[157:43.54]What am I getting up there for seconds?
[157:45.66]If it's available.
[157:49.54]That's right.
[157:51.58]I will always eat double portions of a hot dog.
[157:55.82]Barbecue.
[157:56.46]We've got... Oh, yeah, we've got some cheeseburgers, dogs, maybe some fish, some grilled fish on the grill.
[158:04.16]I'm always going to eat at least three hot dogs, even if I eat other stuff.
[158:18.26]Is this a quiz?
[158:19.70]No, this is the end of the stream.
[158:22.94]about corn dogs they're okay I'd rather have it just a regular dog just one line of mustard on it and that's it nothing else just one single line of mustard across done nothing else and we're talking just straight up yellow just french's mustard nothing fancy nothing fancy
[158:56.79]Loaded chili dog.
[158:57.65]I'll definitely eat it.
[159:00.13]You know, this is good.
[159:02.05]One line of ketchup.
[159:03.31]And then to make sure it doesn't fall off the hot dog.
[159:05.99]Take Tabasco.
[159:07.61]So you take your toasted bun.
[159:09.23]Your hot dog bun.
[159:10.95]Open it up.
[159:12.33]And then take Tabasco.
[159:14.09]And put it inside the bun so it soaks into the bread.
[159:17.69]And then put the hot dog on.
[159:19.37]Drizzle the ketchup.
[159:20.39]And that's it.
[159:23.28]It's delicious.
[159:28.17]Green peppers on a hot dog.
[159:29.49]I've never done that before.
[159:37.53]What's the worst ballpark food?
[159:38.91]Popcorn.
[159:39.41]Popcorn sucks.
[159:40.17]Why would you?
[159:40.69]No, popcorn sucks.
[159:41.63]I hate popcorn.
[159:42.93]I love popcorn when I make it in my own house and sit on my couch.
[159:49.97]I love it.
[159:51.71]But popcorn as a going out food is awful.
[159:59.13]It's awful.
[160:01.89]Movie theater?
[160:02.47]Nope.
[160:03.79]You know what I did?
[160:04.47]Here's my movie theater McDonald's order.
[160:07.41]A large Coke.
[160:09.27]That's it.
[160:12.49]That's it.
[160:14.25]Just a huge, at least 32-ounce Coca-Cola.
[160:20.56]And make sure you piss before the movie.
[160:25.30]Because popcorn, it doesn't matter what size you get, it always ends up the same way.
[160:30.09]You get it, you put a bunch of butter all over it, and oh wow, movie theater popcorn, let's go.
[160:35.41]Your hands end up turning this weird greasy film, and it gets all over your lips.
[160:42.35]You start to get this popcorn exhaustion, where it starts to taste terrible.
[160:48.70]After a while, you've got half a bag of popcorn that you're not going to eat, that you haven't touched, and you just... It's like just butter and oil, and it's just like this greasy flavor, and it's just like, I don't fucking want to eat this anymore.
[161:01.99]It's like, mm-mm.
[161:03.84]Popcorn exhaustion.
[161:04.64]It happens.
[161:06.44]And you end up just getting it stuck in every single tooth.
[161:12.04]You know, I had a piece of popcorn stuck in the gum up here, up underneath my front tooth gum.
[161:19.85]And it was there for three or four days straight.
[161:25.03]I had to go in there because it was either this or I had to go to the dentist.
[161:30.01]It was slid in the gum.
[161:33.08]So I had to really, really meticulously with a fingernail sit there for what felt probably like at least an hour.
[161:40.84]Just get it, get it, get it.
[161:43.58]No, no, it's still in there.
[161:45.92]Finding various tools.
[161:48.32]And then finally, like you slide it down out of the gum.
[161:52.19]It sucked.
[161:57.29]Now, even with a toothpick, it was hard.
[162:04.13]I like popcorn.
[162:04.89]It's just, I don't like eating it at, um, out at places.
[162:11.66]Cause you always have this, you always don't even eat it.
[162:20.24]It can really get bad that you have to go to the dentist.
[162:22.78]I contemplated it at least once.
[162:26.32]You know what I was talking to Holly about, uh, the other day when she was, she looked at me, she was like, what happened to you?
[162:31.59]What happened?
[162:33.11]This is completely unrelated, but I want to talk about it.
[162:36.13]So I get, I've had ingrown hairs that in my nose before.
[162:41.15]So this is why guys don't, don't pluck your nose hairs.
[162:44.70]Don't do it.
[162:46.36]If you want to trim your nose hairs, you trim them to the line, right to the edge of where you're kind of where your nose, right to the edge, kind of here, right?
[162:57.20]Trim them to here.
[162:59.00]Don't go up there with, don't pluck them.
[163:03.65]don't dude stop please stop I'm about to tell you a horrible story don't pluck your nose hairs don't do it just trim them to a point where they're not visible but they're above the line that's it you don't have to do anything else proceed I'm just telling I need to tell a story look this stream is over I'll see you tomorrow if you're gonna show up tomorrow we'll see you tomorrow morning 11 a.m pacific
[163:32.92]So I used to get up there with one of those nose hair trimmers and right.
[163:42.81]And those things, yeah, they get rid of the hair.
[163:44.59]And if you pluck, it gets rid of the hair.
[163:47.03]But on two separate occasions, years apart, I had an ingrown hair in my nose in here, this way.
[163:56.22]So like it was in, like, it was like there, like right here.
[164:00.65]And I'm not making this up.
[164:01.87]This is for real.
[164:03.55]Some of you may have had this experience before.
[164:04.99]It's a horrible experience.
[164:08.77]The nose hair that got ingrown started to be inflamed and it was painful.
[164:17.29]There eventually ended up being a big red painful bump on the outside of my nose.
[164:23.29]And over a week or two, the nose hair that was inside my nose
[164:29.99]came out the front of my nose this way this way and eventually it was in the I'm in the mirror and it's like oh my god and I had to pull it out through the front of my face two different times horrible experience
[164:57.11]I told you this was going to be a gross story.
[164:58.93]I said, be ready.
[165:00.06]Here comes a gross story.
[165:03.44]This can't be true.
[165:04.20]It is.
[165:06.84]It's absolutely true.
[165:14.43]Did it hurt?
[165:15.19]Yes, it did.
[165:17.49]The thing is when the hair finally like actually came out the other side.
[165:20.69]And again, this happened two different times, multiple years apart.
[165:27.53]that didn't hurt it was the whole process of the thing going in and through and just this oh this inflamed painful part of your whole nose viewers dropping yeah I told him to leave
[165:49.12]So don't pluck your nose hairs and don't jam a machine up there.
[165:53.38]No, just be careful.
[165:55.72]Even if you're going to use one of those things, those are fine.
[165:58.92]But just only go up right here.
[166:02.90]Just a little bit.
[166:03.52]You don't have to go far.
[166:06.12]Trust me, I know.
[166:07.80]You'll look in the mirror and go, fuck, alright, those are fucked.
[166:10.25]Okay, let me take care of those.
[166:12.11]Don't go that far.
[166:13.41]Please.
[166:13.63]Please.
[166:23.27]Yeah, and those nose hairs, they actually do quite a good thing for you.
[166:26.39]Somebody just said it.
[166:27.88]Those things actually, you want to have nose hairs.
[166:33.08]They are a defense for you.
[166:36.54]So stop ripping them out.
[166:39.10]Yeah, trim them.
[166:40.78]Alright, I've been on this for way too long.
[166:42.10]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[166:43.26]Goodbye.
[166:44.26]I'll see you later.
[166:44.94]I was going to be talking about nose hairs and like eating the poop out of a lobster.
[166:53.52]I think it's time to go.
[166:54.70]I'll see you guys tomorrow at 11am Pacific.
[167:07.08]Sponsor stream.
[167:08.67]We're going to be playing PowerWash Simulator.
[167:12.75]They're sponsoring a portion of the stream tomorrow.
[167:14.31]It's not the only thing we're doing, but
[167:16.74]They got into contact and it was like, hey, let's do a sponsor stream.
[167:20.47]And I'm like, alright.
[167:21.21]Yeah, I like that game.
[167:24.61]Why not?
[167:26.99]So I'm looking forward to it.
[167:27.79]Should be fun.
[167:30.31]Again, if you didn't catch the beginning of the stream, I know I turned it off.
[167:34.47]The internet problem was not why I turned the stream off.
[167:37.23]I turned the stream off because my OBS was messed up and I couldn't capture a window.
[167:41.88]So there are two different streams here.
[167:45.89]Both of them are like, what, two, three hours long, something like that.
[167:48.55]Three hours long each.
[167:54.72]But, yeah.
[167:56.00]Baseball is now moved to August 19th.
[167:58.51]August 19th.
[168:09.59]If you missed the beginning of the stream, I had to move it.
[168:12.19]I could have done it, but the show would have been worse.
[168:16.23]That's really all you really need to know.
[168:17.71]I don't want to have the show be bad.
[168:20.69]Well, not bad, but not as good as it could be if I waited another 30 days.
[168:32.58]There were some issues with a couple of venues that were going to drastically change the show.
[168:38.81]And I did not want to drastically change the show.
[168:42.23]So, we're doing it in August.
[168:45.97]August 19th.
[168:51.81]But yeah.
[168:56.62]I will see you guys tomorrow morning.
[168:58.56]Have a great rest of your night.
[168:59.40]Thanks for watching.
[169:00.00]Thanks for sticking around.
[169:02.76]PowerWash Simulator.
[169:05.04]Good night.
[169:06.42]Goodbye.
