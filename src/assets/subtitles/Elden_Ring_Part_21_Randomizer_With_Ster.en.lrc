[ve:60.16.100]

[00:21.36]Hello, everybody.
[00:23.34]We're a little late.
[00:26.44]But it's alright.
[00:28.24]We were trying to get... Stroop, you could go ahead and give a small explanation if you want.
[00:37.25]It's really hard to make Elden Ring mods work with other Elden Ring mods without doing a lot of shenanigans to merge things properly and have them load in the right order.
[00:48.03]And I had everything perfectly working.
[00:50.63]but our greed to have it all working really kept us going.
[00:54.58]What was the downfall?
[00:56.83]me well now that's it so we everything seems to be working as intended we have the Diablo II loot mod we have diop we have almost a Diablo II reforged uh we have Elden Ring reforged and a new randomizer seed with new randomizations the problem is Elden Ring reforged probably doesn't work
[01:23.59]One part of it doesn't work.
[01:24.99]Okay.
[01:25.25]It's a really big mod, to be clear.
[01:27.27]There's a lot of stuff in it, and we don't know what doesn't work in it, but the options when you sit down in a bonfire, a tree kills us when we select them.
[01:36.10]Yes.
[01:36.60]I cannot explain that.
[01:38.54]We are instantly killed, and we don't know what it says.
[01:41.72]There's no text string.
[01:43.04]It just says, like, text goes here, and we don't know what we're selecting.
[01:46.83]And then you say yes, and a tree kills you.
[01:49.57]A tree kills you when you say yes.
[01:50.65]Okay.
[01:52.96]And then randomizer works, but the item randomizer does not work.
[01:58.76]So only enemies are randomized, but Diablo items are randomized.
[02:04.09]So here we go.
[02:05.01]So we're good.
[02:05.41]Alright.
[02:10.28]Are you through the tutorial?
[02:11.96]Let's just get through the tutorial first.
[02:14.72]we can get did you make a character no I was looking at the what my starting characters oh you okay alright so I I made somebody so I'll just I'll just do that part first did you did you choose based on like I choo I choosed based on the starting stats because I and plus I got amari oh I was going to look through and see like the starting items because we have for some reason very weird starting items and this one character for me looks like very op
[02:44.92]Interesting.
[02:46.22]Oh, grab it.
[02:46.60]I might.
[02:48.00]This is the character that I have.
[02:51.46]What I want to do, if I can, I want to do like Frenzied Flame shit.
[02:57.82]My character's name is My Eyes with an exclamation point.
[03:03.05]Because your eyes hurt.
[03:04.13]Well, because it's like the fire comes out of their eyes.
[03:07.13]Oh, the Three Fingers, dude.
[03:08.19]Yeah.
[03:16.32]Alright, so hopefully everything went fine.
[03:19.24]I don't know.
[03:22.75]Yeah, I think I got to pick my warrior.
[03:29.73]I'm not going to be able to use my starting weapons for like hours.
[03:34.19]What is your starter weapon?
[03:35.03]The meteorite.
[03:38.98]Beast, great sword.
[03:41.00]He's dual wielding them.
[03:42.84]So how are you going to be able to play?
[03:44.58]You're going to have to wait like two days to play it.
[03:47.90]Yeah, I think it's worth the wait.
[03:53.17]Excuse me, dual welding.
[03:55.01]Get it right.
[03:55.69]Say it correctly.
[03:56.47]Alright, I'm going up.
[04:03.07]So I'm going to show everybody what we're talking about.
[04:06.24]Does anybody know?
[04:07.12]I wanted to play the warlock character.
[04:12.03]Yeah, so Elden Ring Reforged has classes that you get to choose immediately.
[04:16.29]When you sit down in a bonfire, you can buy an item to activate a class.
[04:20.52]But the tree kills us if we try and do it.
[04:23.02]So I don't think we can do any of that.
[04:24.24]There's three other classes that are like...
[04:28.17]drop somewhere so we'll be able to find those and I don't know what they do because it doesn't tell you and I don't think you can get the classes anywhere else yeah because I don't like you I don't know what any of this stuff does I don't think it matters what you want to do so what so if I want to do that the like warlock class from Elden Ring reforged I think you're out of luck because it will kill you
[04:50.10]Okay, wait, wait, somebody said, no, the tree, hold on.
[04:52.86]The tree, it kills you because you changed a difficulty setting in reforge settings, but the text is broken due to compatibility.
[04:58.79]Make sure your config file is everything in the right order.
[05:03.05]That makes sense.
[05:09.01]Oh.
[05:09.11]So this is not where you pick a class?
[05:11.60]It is.
[05:12.42]From one of those option menus, it eventually gets you to a class choice.
[05:16.94]Okay, well, did anybody know which one?
[05:21.02]If I want to do Warlock, does anybody know where that is in here?
[05:25.51]Because I don't know.
[05:37.22]First, third, fifths... Wait.
[05:41.60]What happened?
[05:42.86]That's just hilarious that someone... I don't believe... How could they actually know?
[05:47.28]One, three, two, four...
[05:50.39]Okay, one, three, there's no two here.
[05:55.82]I want to do warlock.
[05:58.56]Go outside the first door to the right avari under the cliff.
[06:01.62]There is something I need?
[06:04.84]Has the fortune to item to change classes.
[06:07.51]Is that for real?
[06:12.61]Alright, let me get out of here first.
[06:13.71]But the Diablo loot should be working, which... It is.
[06:17.75]It is, because I picked up this.
[06:18.91]I have an Uncommon Club on.
[06:21.17]I have an Ancestral Holy Giant Seal of the Godslayer.
[06:25.38]Is that like... Is that like a really good fucking item?
[06:32.35]It's Ancestral.
[06:43.77]I feel like that's a... Did I get like a god item rolled at the very beginning?
[06:48.18]I don't know.
[06:49.24]I don't know what's going on, man.
[06:51.50]Well, we're going to figure it out.
[06:54.36]Oh, also, there's one secret mod in the pack.
[06:57.86]There is?
[06:58.95]Yeah.
[07:01.77]What do you mean?
[07:02.47]And it only affects Ronnie.
[07:09.09]You didn't put a... No, there's no way you did that.
[07:16.34]Although I did just, hey, dude, take a bunch of these files and put them in your folder.
[07:21.06]And I was like, yeah, sure.
[07:22.06]That makes sense.
[07:23.49]So you could have probably put anything you wanted in here.
[07:29.55]I'm glad that you trust me, but not enough to be like a mod on your channel.
[07:35.10]That's too much for you.
[07:36.44]That's too much power for you.
[07:38.08]I agree.
[07:38.66]Completely.
[07:39.10]Alright, I am... I'm like ready to get in your game.
[07:43.08]You're at... You're at the church.
[07:45.25]I assume.
[07:45.89]Well, no.
[07:46.25]I mean, I will be.
[07:49.49]Okay.
[07:50.17]I'm running to the church and then I'm gonna open my world.
[07:52.35]What'd you think of the halftime show?
[07:56.84]Um...
[07:58.86]It was kind of like, it was good.
[08:02.88]I don't even, I, I have no, I didn't guys.
[08:04.28]I didn't even, I forgot the super bowl was today.
[08:06.20]Same.
[08:07.42]I forgot the super bowl was literally today.
[08:13.11]I thought they stopped doing sports.
[08:17.13]Okay.
[08:17.41]I am at the church.
[08:22.73]There's been a lot going on.
[08:24.07]There's been a lot going on.
[08:25.51]Right?
[08:25.95]Like, my brain, I just, I would have normally probably watched it.
[08:30.51]Okay, strengthen armament or event to talk, whatever.
[08:36.16]Common sleep's urd tree seal?
[08:38.24]Okay.
[08:41.34]What does that mean?
[08:43.91]Causes sleep buildup?
[08:47.19]What?
[08:47.35]What?
[08:51.01]I'm very confused by how this works.
[08:52.65]Okay.
[08:53.75]Oh, yeah.
[08:54.09]Like, all of the status effects, I believe, got changed.
[08:57.36]So, like, sleep functions a little bit differently.
[08:59.90]Like, poison's a little bit different.
[09:02.20]Like, Reforged did a lot of stuff.
[09:03.90]Don't know what any of it is.
[09:05.40]Okay.
[09:05.70]Alright.
[09:05.92]So, I can burn my... Alright.
[09:07.88]I'm ready to join your game.
[09:09.27]Are we ready?
[09:10.19]It's open.
[09:10.93]Let's go.
[09:20.40]Dude, the Red Sox won the Super Bowl.
[09:23.16]I can't believe the Red Sox won again.
[09:24.72]Dude, if I sell both of my starting swords, and they are Diablo-ified, Mythical Burning Falling Star Beasts of Piety requires 60 strength and 54 int.
[09:35.63]And 32 dex.
[09:35.93]I am never equipping these.
[09:36.83]Okay.
[09:37.11]We need to get, like, items.
[09:38.79]We have items.
[09:49.33]Because items have random stats on them too.
[09:51.29]Rare.
[09:52.73]Does it have?
[09:53.21]Do the items have like stats?
[09:56.59]OK, this is mind plus one.
[09:58.78]Alright, so gear has actual stats on it.
[10:04.02]Increases stamina regen by 8%.
[10:05.28]OK.
[10:05.58]Yeah, you look ridiculous.
[10:12.46]Yeah, and I believe they have random ashes of war because it's just scream.
[10:17.10]Can you even can you swing them?
[10:22.97]Alright, so what's plan number one is do we look up screenshots of how to pick a class?
[10:29.77]I don't know that there's any way we could.
[10:32.63]Can somebody please help us?
[10:36.43]It was working, but it's not working in the specific mod load order.
[10:41.79]But we kind of had to stop, you know?
[10:44.23]Yeah, we had to turn the stream on.
[10:46.27]So, alright.
[10:47.47]If I want to play Warlock...
[10:51.58]Well, I know that they all cost 100 soul, so we should at least you should at the very least sell something and have 100.
[10:58.19]What is it so that you can potentially accidentally buy?
[11:03.09]I already don't worry about anything.
[11:06.42]I both of these swords are worth 15,000, but I I ain't selling.
[11:12.16]OK.
[11:13.62]So I have enough to to pick a class.
[11:18.65]I want the Warlock, because I want the Frenzy Flame shit to be more powerful.
[11:26.90]So which one of these is pick class?
[11:29.70]First one, third one, second one.
[11:31.97]First, third, second one?
[11:37.19]your chat's just gonna guess stop saying no elf stop that we need elf and here's the problem if you do choose the apparently the branch that kills you those are difficulty options so you may accidentally change the game difficulty to like hardcore okay wait wait one somebody said one two one two one one wait one two one
[12:08.13]Good luck, dog.
[12:11.36]One... There's got to be a way to fucking know this.
[12:15.98]One, two... We need an... Yeah, we need an oracle effigy.
[12:27.47]Yeah, that's what you buy from this normally.
[12:29.87]There would be a shop here to buy them.
[12:31.81]But there's no shop.
[12:35.85]I mean...
[12:38.26]Chat is too silly.
[12:39.14]Sorry, bud.
[12:39.66]We can't help you.
[12:43.30]Well... They changed it?
[12:47.54]This is an older version of Reforged so that I could work with Diablo loot.
[12:53.14]Well, look.
[12:54.54]Let's just go.
[12:56.32]Let's just go.
[12:58.38]Somebody will figure it out.
[13:01.24]I don't think...
[13:04.96]Well, we we we have gear right now.
[13:07.26]We can go at least go kill like Margaret or something.
[13:11.72]Yeah.
[13:21.48]Man, oh man, what a what a nice day out in Limgrave.
[13:27.18]You want to go to the?
[13:27.98]Where are you going?
[13:31.16]I was just going to walk into like one of these random directions.
[13:34.48]Oh, well, we need the horse.
[13:35.54]Yeah, we need the horse.
[13:37.82]Melinda.
[13:44.88]So anything can drop Diablo loot.
[13:46.93]Everything.
[13:47.65]There is no more regular items in this game.
[13:51.05]There are regular items, and then there's also Diablo items.
[14:00.78]There's a lot of things.
[14:10.42]This does pretty good damage.
[14:14.36]I don't have nearly the stats for this and I one shot that enemy, so.
[14:18.16]Pretty good.
[14:30.51]I look like a phantom.
[14:31.97]Yeah, and apparently I'm like stealing their souls.
[14:35.21]What?
[14:36.17]I don't know.
[14:36.60]Are we classes that we don't know what they are?
[14:40.70]Do we accidentally pick classes by killing ourselves with the thing a few times?
[14:48.54]Our starting equipment has mods on it from Diablo mod.
[14:53.32]Oh, right, right, right.
[14:56.21]Yeah, my armor strengthens Golden Order incantations by 10%, and I probably have something that is healing me.
[15:08.50]Oh, my God.
[15:13.54]This weapon.
[15:14.56]No, please don't kill me.
[15:15.62]Yeah.
[15:16.24]My helmet restores health on kill.
[15:18.90]It seems like it works even if you kill something.
[15:27.62]I did some damage.
[15:37.73]Oh my God, I'm dead.
[15:39.61]What happens if I die?
[15:43.43]Oh God, what?
[15:49.02]Did you die too?
[15:50.92]No, but I'm poisoned.
[15:55.33]I mean, it's coming close.
[15:56.85]Can I respawn here?
[15:57.99]I'm getting the bonfire.
[16:08.00]Whoa, I think my game crashed.
[16:10.82]Oh, I rested at the bonfire and it's the Molina cut scene, so maybe your game did crash.
[16:15.50]Oh, it just pulled me to you.
[16:16.70]Oh, give me one second.
[16:25.13]Just talking to me about feet, I don't... I do see the subs, but what I want to tell you is that's way too much.
[16:33.54]I really appreciate it, but one of the reasons why I don't like to address subs is I feel like it encourages it.
[16:40.02]And that's a lot of money.
[16:41.17]That's way too much money.
[16:44.43]That's way too much money to be giving an individual streamer like me.
[16:49.13]So I do appreciate anybody supporting this stream, but that's way too much.
[16:55.48]Thank you so much, but that is, I would say that is enough.
[16:59.22]That's a lot.
[17:02.30]That is far too much to give one individual person.
[17:05.40]Especially me.
[17:06.26]Especially me.
[17:08.47]So please just be careful.
[17:10.07]Do not put yourself in financial burden.
[17:12.73]Do not give this stream money because you think I... Even if you think I deserve it.
[17:20.85]You guys take such good care of me already.
[17:23.10]No one individual has to give like hundreds or thousands of subs.
[17:28.54]I really appreciate it.
[17:30.36]But I...
[17:33.02]I don't think that worked.
[17:37.66]But one of the reasons why I don't address subs is because I don't want to encourage people to get into this loop where they give so many.
[17:47.17]It's something I don't like to encourage.
[17:49.39]Because I don't want it to be something that people think that they should do too.
[17:52.09]So, that's all I'm going to say about it.
[17:54.71]I appreciate anything that anybody does to this channel.
[17:57.49]Please take care of yourself.
[17:58.78]Don't give me that much money.
[18:00.84]Give me five bucks a month.
[18:02.48]That's your decision if you want to pay five bucks a month to this channel.
[18:05.98]You absolutely do not have to.
[18:08.50]But I don't like to encourage subs.
[18:12.12]If that makes any sense.
[18:14.88]I would rather you spend that money on something in your life, maybe on some other smaller streamers.
[18:20.66]Not me.
[18:21.66]Do not give me a thousand subs individually.
[18:24.40]I'm just going to tell you.
[18:27.92]Thank you so much, everybody.
[18:30.56]Now we game.
[18:32.85]Ring mods did Elden Ring mods.
[18:35.25]Yeah, I turned on an option.
[18:38.21]Can you rest?
[18:38.81]Can you rest of the bonfire again?
[18:41.01]What'd you do?
[18:49.87]Hold on.
[18:50.55]Okay.
[18:51.33]I turned on the option that always to spectate you after dying because I have seen these menus before and I realized that I stumbled onto the correct option, but I don't know if we both need to turn that option on.
[19:06.60]So for me, when I die, I will not respond ever until you touch a bonfire.
[19:13.94]I can guide you if we both have to have it.
[19:16.64]So where do I go from here?
[19:21.15]the bottom event text for talk okay wait was it I don't remember I don't want to touch anything let me just get my horse well we'll see how I think I know which one it is three two one two three three stop saying numbers three two three three three summon me ah I bequeath
[19:50.27]Okay.
[19:51.97]I've got Torrent.
[20:02.55]You level up?
[20:04.86]I died, so I don't have any crunchies.
[20:06.94]No crunchies.
[20:15.79]Okay.
[20:16.83]I mean, you want to grab the items from around here?
[20:20.81]I think that's probably... Wait, let me get this on the bar.
[20:29.52]Wait, how come... There it is.
[20:31.20]Okay.
[20:33.78]Move that.
[20:37.72]Switch.
[20:38.02]Okay.
[20:39.24]There it is.
[20:41.43]Alright.
[20:42.73]I don't have any crunchies, so you can level up.
[20:44.69]Okay, wait, wait.
[20:45.61]No, come to the bonfire.
[20:46.49]I know which one it is.
[20:52.14]The bottom event text for talk.
[20:53.84]Okay.
[20:56.42]And then the second from the bottom event text for talk.
[21:00.06]Okay.
[21:01.08]And then yes.
[21:01.92]And what is this doing?
[21:03.58]That is whenever you die, you are forced into spectator mode.
[21:07.09]Okay.
[21:09.27]Nice, I activated it.
[21:10.39]I didn't die.
[21:11.81]Yeah.
[21:14.63]And the one below that is when either of us dies, we both die.
[21:18.65]So don't touch that one.
[21:22.19]Unless you want us to be soul linked.
[21:24.21]I don't think that should have been.
[21:25.43]That's probably a bad idea.
[21:28.33]I mean, I would.
[21:29.37]Alright, are we ready?
[21:30.57]Pay a lot of money to be soul linked.
[21:32.31]Alright, let's go.
[21:40.18]Help me.
[21:44.83]What does it look like I'm doing?
[21:46.85]Missing every swing.
[21:53.60]Okay.
[21:54.96]Oh yeah.
[21:55.24]The items are not going to be randomized.
[21:57.64]It's just, I don't know where Diablo items spawn.
[22:01.05]Like that was a talisman of fury.
[22:03.23]I don't.
[22:03.83]You know what would have been so cool?
[22:05.95]If, if when I joined the game a little, and this is just like funny things that they could have added on the bottom, like a little text pop up that says so-and-so has joined your game.
[22:16.46]Diablo's minions grow stronger.
[22:23.55]did you even get that item what you just you're just running in a random direction again wait what happened it was a wait where well like you oh after yeah right right right you can loot this we can we can go down and get the thing that lets you apply ashes of wars and it's a really important item if the items aren't randomized we should probably get that frost long sword oh yeah then our diablo loot is different because I got a talisman from there cool alright hey hey
[22:49.10]Take a look at this then, because you were a magic.
[22:52.96]I don't know how to drop it.
[22:54.38]Where is it?
[22:55.40]It's dead.
[22:56.40]Don't delete it.
[22:59.32]Watch out, bird!
[23:05.18]So the difference between this one and the last time we played this.
[23:08.60]Okay, it's leaving.
[23:09.38]Alright, well, whatever.
[23:11.42]So this is a new seed.
[23:13.88]It's leaving.
[23:15.12]The best enemy in the game.
[23:19.08]Am I jumping higher?
[23:22.62]Maybe.
[23:24.02]There's a lot of very small changes that you might notice.
[23:27.18]Like sitting at the bonfire, the animation is quicker in Reforged.
[23:34.31]It is.
[23:34.67]Alright.
[23:35.23]So let me level up.
[23:36.97]And I believe your jump animation starts sooner.
[23:39.49]So there's a lot of tiny things.
[23:43.17]Well, I definitely need this.
[23:44.03]So I'm going to put it in there.
[23:47.32]So are we just trying to get to... Let's do one of the little dungeons over here.
[23:50.70]Yeah.
[23:51.30]Let's go for it.
[23:52.14]Yeah, let's respawn the enemies again.
[23:53.88]Yeah.
[23:54.14]Let's kill one enemy and then let's respawn them again.
[23:56.57]Well, I had to level up.
[23:57.37]You told me to level up.
[23:58.89]Okay.
[23:59.29]Well, I had to not level up.
[24:00.69]Okay.
[24:01.61]So let's kill the crab again.
[24:03.91]No, just get on your horse and let's go to the place we need to go.
[24:06.39]Well, no, there's the dungeon.
[24:07.73]Come back.
[24:08.90]Right now.
[24:09.86]Get back here right now.
[24:11.26]There's the catacomb in this area.
[24:12.74]Oh, there is.
[24:13.44]The sword that you need to use Ashes of War.
[24:23.57]We have to have the big enemies spawn here?
[24:26.22]Yes.
[24:26.84]This ant is a boss.
[24:31.62]Where even am I?
[24:33.88]Whoa!
[24:36.42]Valid questions.
[24:38.98]Whoa!
[24:40.67]I'm going to die from this.
[24:42.43]You're getting three fingered!
[24:44.77]You can't use that until I actually have the power.
[24:47.47]Okay.
[24:50.61]Ah, shit!
[24:51.21]You just got two clawed!
[24:57.22]Wait, why can I do this?
[25:00.02]Your sword's Ashes of War is going to be randomized with Diablo loot.
[25:03.60]What the fuck?
[25:05.38]Yeah, so this one is the stab myself.
[25:09.17]I got the kill yourself poison sword.
[25:12.19]Jesus.
[25:18.12]Treasured, furious...
[25:23.34]Holy shit.
[25:23.86]Okay, hold on.
[25:25.26]Plus one holy damage percent plus one extra magic damage taken.
[25:30.22]I said that so badly.
[25:34.47]One extra magic damage.
[25:36.61]That's like a two-year-old.
[25:37.87]I take extra magic damage.
[25:41.75]One extra.
[25:42.57]Look.
[25:44.30]Look, daddy.
[25:45.64]Look, daddy.
[25:46.20]Magic damage.
[25:48.52]Daddy, look.
[25:50.12]And then the dad never looks.
[25:52.78]bro come on oh also another thing I know is it's easier to um to deplete poison enemies because they don't regenerate it as quickly
[26:05.76]Give me one sec.
[26:06.88]Move this out of the way.
[26:07.94]Move this out of the way.
[26:09.06]Move this out of the way.
[26:14.00]Oh, fuck.
[26:14.66]Please don't kill me.
[26:15.98]I'm hyping.
[26:16.78]I mean, you stopped moving in the middle of Main Street.
[26:23.17]For some reason, I didn't think there was going to be anything over here.
[26:26.69]I thought, like, we killed it all.
[26:29.69]Oh, no.
[26:40.58]That thing is so bad.
[26:42.90]Dude, stop swinging.
[26:44.40]Can you help me?
[26:45.86]I'm going to die.
[26:46.62]No, I can't help you.
[26:47.82]I probably am going to die too.
[26:49.90]Let's just reset it.
[26:50.50]Let's just come back here.
[26:51.70]No, we killed everything.
[27:01.27]please please don't do it but we don't have I'm coming I'm helping I'm coming this thing's gonna kill you he's the last thing we gotta kill he's well let's ignore him then come over here we just gotta go in the basement I thought I could keep him staggered I'm dead I said ignore him I know but you're gonna die in the basement over there there's no enemy in here that's just a chest
[27:28.21]Well, whatever.
[27:29.01]It doesn't matter.
[27:30.45]It really kind of does.
[27:33.03]You shouldn't downplay.
[27:34.15]It matters that you're dead.
[27:40.36]Alright, I gotta get into the swing of things here.
[27:57.78]Okay, you respawn.
[27:59.00]I'm back.
[28:06.85]Don't die.
[28:07.43]Okay.
[28:15.45]Let's fight the crab.
[28:18.71]No, we're leveling up.
[28:20.13]Let's do what you said.
[28:20.77]Avoid.
[28:21.41]Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid.
[28:23.69]Okay.
[28:24.43]Okay.
[28:34.80]Yeah.
[28:36.04]I'm avoiding.
[28:39.94]That should, I don't even know how that hit me.
[28:42.00]Straight from here.
[28:42.82]Follow me.
[28:45.42]Cave.
[28:46.86]Yep.
[28:47.88]In.
[28:49.16]In.
[28:49.66]Going in?
[28:50.08]In cave.
[28:51.80]In cave.
[28:52.52]Okay.
[28:59.11]The whetstone knife.
[29:01.38]Perfect.
[29:02.36]Pretty good piece of equipment there.
[29:07.78]Uncommon magic moon veil.
[29:11.12]So what are the rarities?
[29:12.18]Is it common?
[29:13.16]Uncommon?
[29:13.70]I have like an ancestral.
[29:15.55]It's Diablo.
[29:16.45]So I imagine it's Diablo.
[29:20.91]But also, I don't know.
[29:22.37]Actually, I think they were kind of weird.
[29:23.43]There's like above legendary.
[29:25.39]There's like epic, super ultra mythic.
[29:34.83]That can never come out, no.
[29:38.59]It doesn't.
[29:41.72]The second one was like really supposed to be coming out, right?
[29:44.92]Yeah, but then they started trying to outsource their game to random people to make and then I haven't heard anything about it since then.
[29:52.81]Alright, so we're good.
[29:54.27]We got what we needed from here.
[29:57.51]Ready to rock and roll.
[29:59.93]Rock and roll in which direction?
[30:02.54]my what we should do here's what I'm going to propose summer jail summer jail storm but not summer dude today is a lizard just a little off it's it's that's I read the s summer jail I'm very confused on where we're going I want to go to the Evergaol not hold on okay
[30:36.06]okay Stormhill Evergaol not summer jail it's behind us can can we go up oh no we have to go through stormville castle okay I don't so not where you would go up that hill and then you turn around and hook left yeah
[31:04.73]We could just go game progress or we could try to wrap around there.
[31:07.87]I mean, remember, we're like level zero.
[31:12.47]You have I know that you got spoiled last run and you got like five remembrances by this point.
[31:17.90]Right.
[31:18.14]But you're actually very low level right now.
[31:20.04]Did you jump off?
[31:21.08]I went down here.
[31:24.66]I mean, we really you know what it is, the map is revealed and it's like freaking me out, like being able to see literally every single thing in the game.
[31:32.41]I don't know where to go because my brain's like, look at every single thing is here.
[31:37.51]Would you like to be demoted?
[31:43.11]I think we just go up here.
[31:44.31]Okay.
[31:54.56]What a mess.
[32:00.73]Oh my God, what the fuck is that?
[32:12.35]OK.
[32:12.43]Did I bird a good?
[32:16.29]Yeah, so we could.
[32:17.14]Let's try to fight whatever this is.
[32:18.62]Let's get this gotta be a bonfire right here, right?
[32:21.92]No, but if you die in here, it just puts you here, doesn't it?
[32:25.56]As long as we say the statue.
[32:28.20]Yeah, yeah, statue right there.
[32:35.13]Let's go into the Summer Jail.
[32:38.68]It was the... Stormhill... Evergaol Storm... Jail Summer Jail... The words just mix together.
[32:48.51]That should be easy.
[32:51.99]This is a good fight to... I load it into the game, let's go.
[32:56.27]We're so dead.
[33:05.03]Is there a phase two as well?
[33:07.57]Probably.
[33:08.11]OK, good luck.
[33:16.58]Where are they?
[33:33.90]Where did he go?
[33:35.28]Where did who go?
[33:39.91]Wait, are you coming back in?
[33:42.19]No, I died.
[33:44.05]I just died too, but it's not... Okay, um... Godefroy... Godefroy ran away.
[33:52.94]And now, um... It's still... You're still in the fight with Godefroy.
[33:57.46]No, I'm not.
[33:59.02]I'm... I'm gonna go touch a bonfire.
[34:02.07]Yeah.
[34:06.86]you uh you've been feeling okay I mean if you saw my screen you'd be pretty confused I got vikes war spear which is uh well probably it won't have the same actual war on my screen right now you are in the Evergaol still
[34:31.68]In the summer jail.
[34:32.70]In the summer... Summer hill... I think I was going to say summer hill jail.
[34:39.53]I don't know why.
[34:40.07]Is the S blended into the other word?
[34:45.60]I touched a bonfire.
[34:46.66]Are you okay?
[34:48.48]I am back alive.
[34:56.37]Did you respawn at the stake?
[34:58.17]I respawned at the stake near the jail.
[35:00.71]I would recommend coming up here to the bonfire because there's a charge to your flask along the way.
[35:08.52]And I don't think that we should be picking fights like spawning into the game and then fighting Godefroy in the summer jails.
[35:16.40]No.
[35:18.43]Okay, so let me get my souls.
[35:25.46]Did I even have any souls?
[35:27.90]Probably not.
[35:28.76]I had 2000.
[35:33.04]Alright, I'm coming to you.
[35:37.30]I mean, there also is always the chance that we go to fight Morgott and it like really now because the randomizer is a little bit more random.
[35:45.42]We could be getting that mad soldier.
[35:49.94]I would love that.
[35:50.64]Or.
[35:52.28]Or.
[35:57.67]or whoa wait a minute I just got like I got like a legendary thing hold on rare bolt charge dragon communion seal of the something okay what the hell what I got like a legendary helmet night sorceries by 30 strength in them holy
[36:27.34]Are you going to use sorcerers at all?
[36:29.48]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[36:31.54]I kind of had a plan, but then we die if we try and do anything.
[36:37.40]Alright.
[36:39.03]With this, what happened?
[36:41.09]I thought you touched another text thing.
[36:43.19]Okay.
[36:46.53]You know, it's the complexity of these mods increasing.
[36:53.70]Okay, there you go.
[37:02.77]I feel like this is probably not even as good as it's not.
[37:08.17]Alright.
[37:09.89]So we have a million options.
[37:12.43]Option number one is to just go fight whoever's up there, like you said.
[37:17.06]Option number two is to go check out, you know, one of the shacks.
[37:20.34]I think we should do some of the easier catacombs and get some more random mythic items and level up because it requires 60 strength to use my weapons that I currently have.
[37:30.10]I basically have...
[37:32.05]Nothing.
[37:32.95]So then let's go do one of the catacombs.
[37:35.33]Yeah, we don't have any smithing stones.
[37:37.89]We don't have anything.
[37:39.71]Remember, we played this recently and we were pretty strong.
[37:43.48]We're not.
[37:44.58]We don't have anything.
[37:46.06]Yeah, I think it could because we just did randomizer.
[37:48.64]We just did this.
[37:49.26]My brain is almost like, oh, wait, we're new characters.
[37:52.14]You're blaming a lot of this on your brain, but I feel like you are the one in control of your brain.
[38:00.85]You ate meat that was out for 16 hours.
[38:02.36]You don't get to say anything.
[38:06.20]And I lived.
[38:08.86]And I was fine.
[38:14.22]Isn't there a merchant man in here?
[38:15.84]I think so.
[38:17.48]Up the road some ways there's a catacomb.
[38:23.46]Alright, where did OK Bernard?
[38:29.64]Should we say to Bernard?
[38:31.80]What do you mean?
[38:33.66]Why should we say my faith holds firm?
[38:35.90]Yeah, sure, my faith is firm.
[38:37.58]I'm pretty fucking firm right now.
[38:39.08]Ash of war no skill.
[38:40.56]Um?
[38:50.96]yeah I know a lot of this stuff too I know like the kick got buffed like a lot of stuff that would normally be kind of bad got buffed with uh reforged so I'm gonna buy kick and and use that instead of stab myself I have fire on mine what's actually on this that's kind of cool
[39:20.92]huh it won't let me change anything what do you mean I don't know none of my weapons are showing up in the ashes of war so maybe diablo items are like hard set you might on how you find them is it possible you can change them out at the blacksmith uh I don't know it should be the same exact mechanic
[39:50.29]You need an item to change them.
[39:52.01]Okay.
[39:52.53]We have to have an item.
[39:53.43]That's what we got in that basement, I thought, was the whetstone blade.
[39:57.61]Don't you have to have a blacksmith do it anyways, though?
[40:00.89]I don't think so.
[40:10.26]Yeah, the whetstone blade.
[40:10.86]We got it.
[40:12.36]Anyway, let's...
[40:15.41]Let's go this way.
[40:16.69]Yeah, we need to level up.
[40:18.15]My health bar is so how much how much bigger do you?
[40:22.25]Like 14 Diablo does not let you change them.
[40:25.55]You can only level weapons up twice.
[40:29.82]What do you mean when you say level weapons up?
[40:32.42]That's I'm screening from chat.
[40:33.46]I'm not sure what it means.
[40:34.86]Yeah, I'm asking them.
[40:37.04]What do they mean?
[40:47.17]Okay.
[40:48.91]I mean, we could see what's in Margit's room.
[40:51.52]Like you said, what if it's a mad soldier?
[40:53.54]There's a catacombs right up here, man.
[40:56.52]You keep saying you don't know what you want to do, and then we go do something, and then you say we could go do the thing that we're not doing.
[41:02.68]Well, we just did something.
[41:07.95]Just calling it as I'm seeing it.
[41:14.21]And there's a chest in here.
[41:15.35]Do you want to open the chest or you want to just immediately abandon and go to Margo?
[41:22.82]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[41:29.86]Chest on table.
[41:31.14]You left some gold in Ricton.
[41:33.92]Just a common scythe.
[41:36.01]Hook, claws.
[41:39.25]This thing's still better.
[41:47.35]Okay.
[41:49.53]Did you get something good?
[41:52.89]I got a weird war pick.
[41:56.09]It says inflicts damage when rolling into enemies.
[42:03.71]Oh, and these claws have vacuum slice.
[42:06.67]These items are pretty weird.
[42:10.85]What vacuum slice?
[42:12.59]It's a magic hammer that deals damage when I roll on things.
[42:17.24]Vacuum slices the gargoyle attack that shoots like the air blast in a line.
[42:26.45]Think that I that's what I got.
[42:27.77]I got that air blasting too.
[42:33.34]Yeah, right down this road there should be a cave.
[42:36.73]and I'm sorry I'm really pushing us to do it.
[42:39.05]I know that I'm being a bit of a blocky boot.
[42:41.21]I don't want to do a cave.
[42:41.81]I want to do Margit.
[42:42.99]The whole time we did the last run, I was like, we should really do some of these starting caves.
[42:49.75]I'm kidding.
[42:51.61]I want to do the cave.
[42:53.34]Dad!
[43:00.30]I wanted to do Margit.
[43:01.36]I wanted to go to Wendy's.
[43:06.13]Actually, let me level up first.
[43:09.51]Is Wendy's your fast food of choice?
[43:11.88]When you want a chicken sandwich, where are you going?
[43:13.58]McDonald's.
[43:15.62]Wait, hold on.
[43:18.17]The original McChicken from McDonald's.
[43:21.09]Not this new spicy bullshit.
[43:22.79]Let me be honest with you.
[43:25.65]The original McChicken sandwich from McDonald's.
[43:29.31]I like it.
[43:29.83]A lot.
[43:30.55]But this new spicy McChicken that they put everywhere and they want you so badly to order that and not the original one?
[43:36.19]Come on.
[43:37.43]I want the original McChicken.
[43:38.81]I don't want the spicy powder all over it.
[43:43.71]Do you feel me?
[43:45.03]I got to be honest.
[43:46.46]I don't really know.
[43:47.10]I don't know much about.
[43:48.88]I didn't even know McDonald's had chicken.
[43:52.30]Come on.
[43:54.50]I've never had one.
[43:56.37]But you knew that McDonald's had chicken on the menu.
[44:00.33]I know that they have chicken nuggets.
[44:03.79]Well, I mean, that counts.
[44:06.09]I didn't know.
[44:10.55]I didn't know that McDonald's had chicken.
[44:13.61]That's like saying I didn't know that Campbell's had soup.
[44:17.37]Hold on.
[44:18.07]Hold on a second.
[44:19.75]One guy.
[44:24.26]Okay, never mind.
[44:25.50]I saw a weird comment and it was just Ster healthy and based.
[44:30.18]He doesn't know McDonald's has chicken, therefore healthy and based.
[44:36.38]I like that.
[44:41.04]I don't know.
[44:41.34]Like there's so many places now that like specifically would call themselves like we're chicken places.
[44:47.08]So for you to pick McDonald's to be the best chicken sandwiches, I don't know.
[44:50.58]It surprised me.
[44:51.16]I didn't even know that they did it because I haven't been in a McDonald's in a long time.
[44:54.00]Last time I went to a McDonald's, it was the only ones I've really went to were like New York, like in the subway.
[45:00.39]This guy's really hard, by the way.
[45:02.43]I'm dead.
[45:04.91]He's going to kill you in one hit.
[45:05.85]Oh.
[45:11.63]Healthy and based.
[45:13.61]Well, I didn't say... Here's the thing.
[45:17.50]Oh my god, my game crashed.
[45:20.10]That's not fair.
[45:21.22]It's not fair.
[45:22.18]I didn't say that it's not the best.
[45:24.62]I don't think it's the best chicken sandwich, but it hits pretty well.
[45:29.56]That was the question, though.
[45:30.92]Yeah, but it kind of is the best for me.
[45:32.97]Even though it's not... Quality-wise, it's not the best sandwich.
[45:36.27]I would say for me, I prefer... Uh-oh.
[45:43.53]That's not good.
[45:45.41]What's not good?
[45:47.66]It didn't open three times.
[45:48.76]Hold on.
[45:53.04]Is this you just acting out that you don't want to do this cave?
[45:58.16]That would be actually pretty funny.
[46:04.60]But no, the issue is McDonald's, you know exactly what you're getting every time.
[46:11.71]It's incredibly consistent.
[46:13.53]A McChicken from McDonald's is the same McChicken that it's been to the last 10 years.
[46:18.35]But unfortunately, now they added the spicy shit on it.
[46:20.78]So it's not consistent.
[46:22.32]Unfortunately, it's not consistent.
[46:27.98]Well, no, I mean, in a way, that backs up your argument that they changed something one time and it upset you.
[46:35.56]That they should have been consistent.
[46:37.30]They should have been.
[46:39.38]Alright, I'm back.
[46:41.56]Did you kill that thing?
[46:43.02]I did.
[46:43.32]Can you put your thing down?
[46:47.42]My thing should be down.
[46:48.66]Well, I wonder if I spawn in a weird place.
[46:50.85]I'm going to separation miss.
[46:53.59]Did you join me?
[46:54.29]Did you try and join me?
[46:55.53]I just did.
[46:57.53]I was separating.
[46:59.31]I'm now alone.
[47:00.81]I'm wandering.
[47:02.07]I'm looking for you.
[47:06.21]I have appeared well kind of okay the quality of your diablo weapon is what material you need and then all diablo items can only be +2 okay so you are you still I'm still in that catacomb I don't know if it put me in your game
[47:36.66]don't see you on the mini map on the uh compass I never said you joined my world uh that's interesting maybe I can't do it down here maybe because the catacombs make you um like you can't fast travel to and from them
[48:00.54]It says I'm joining.
[48:02.44]Oh, okay.
[48:02.96]I'm going to go back to the bonfire.
[48:05.54]Wait, no, it does say you were in my game.
[48:06.74]Okay, you joined.
[48:08.16]Yeah, that was weird.
[48:13.32]There you are, yeah.
[48:13.82]I must have just bugged out.
[48:16.74]Yeah, McChickens for me were... It's just like, oh yeah, of course I like McChickens.
[48:22.70]I'm going to order a McChicken.
[48:23.54]Of course I will.
[48:25.46]A lot of other places that I've been to, it was not that consistent.
[48:30.09]And I know it's just like a patty, right?
[48:32.73]That's why it was consistent for me.
[48:36.77]Have you gone to the McDonald's in Japan?
[48:40.17]No, I heard it's good though.
[48:41.60]Well, you're saying they're consistent everywhere.
[48:43.62]But have you been everywhere?
[48:47.20]Dude, I've not been outside of North America.
[48:50.61]Well, is the McDonald's consistent outside of your limited small bubble worldview?
[48:56.49]I guess, I don't know.
[49:05.88]Whoa, okay.
[49:07.40]You were just fighting nothing on my screen and it just poured it in and I can't hurt it.
[49:12.05]Can it hurt me?
[49:12.45]Uh...
[49:20.18]I don't know.
[49:20.72]I don't know what's happening.
[49:23.78]I'm poisoned.
[49:24.46]It hurts.
[49:25.80]Oh, he's poisoned.
[49:27.72]Yeah, I'm going to die.
[49:28.92]I'm running back.
[49:29.70]I have a lot of souls.
[49:30.54]Alright, what's your favorite chicken sandwich?
[49:39.79]Oh, boy.
[49:43.57]Yeah, I have infinite stamina, too.
[49:45.88]yeah that's part of a reforged I'm gonna die like right as I touch this oh lucky um I don't like there was that big craze a while ago where every person in America was literally murdering people for like the Popeye's chicken sandwich right that's why I thought like you were gonna have some like exclusive like I killed a guy for this sandwich I don't like a lot of places I don't really care that much
[50:10.83]It seems like the kind of thing you would care about.
[50:12.77]No.
[50:13.57]Oh, I got to eat every chicken sandwich from every... Why do you think I care that much about chicken sandwiches?
[50:20.54]It, like, falls under the category of, like, fast food or cereal, which is, like, one of your biggest...
[50:27.20]Dude, the last bowl of cereal I ate was honey bunches of oats with strawberry back in fucking 2019.
[50:34.09]You talk about cereal mascots so often that it just seems like, I don't know.
[50:39.81]I can't be a fan.
[50:40.57]I can't be a fan of cereal.
[50:41.81]I have to like eat every cereal.
[50:43.39]I can't just like watching the cereal.
[50:45.69]I can't like enjoy watching like the characters do their commercials.
[50:48.72]Hold on, I gotta go level up.
[50:50.28]What?

[51:17.24]had a YouTube channel where he was like, oh, hey, Crunchtastic Crunchateers, it's me, Cap'n Crunch.
[51:23.10]You wouldn't watch every single one.
[51:25.02]I don't even watch the Gorillaz YouTube channel, and that's basically what that is.
[51:31.64]No, no, no, no.
[51:32.22]We're talking like Cap'n Crunch is doing what Chuck E. Cheese did.
[51:35.38]He's like streaming Elden Ring.
[51:38.48]You wouldn't watch that?
[51:39.92]Cap'n Crunch is streaming Elden Ring.
[51:42.82]I will take a look.
[51:44.12]Yes, you, of course you would.
[51:46.85]I probably would not stay longer than like a minute, but I would have to look.
[51:58.00]He's got a rare.
[52:00.14]Oh, nice rare.
[52:05.66]Poison plus three end.
[52:11.97]Yeah, we saw how streaming worked for the mascots.
[52:14.38]Yeah, but here's the thing.
[52:15.50]Chuck E. Cheese didn't talk.
[52:18.28]The Chuck E. Cheese that streamed didn't talk at all.
[52:21.19]Oh, watch out for this guy.
[52:24.01]This guy!
[52:26.73]Captain Crunch was screaming on Twitch, and he was like, Oh my, Captain Crunch cereal!
[52:30.71]If he said that before every single sentence, people would fucking go crazy for it.
[52:36.15]Get rekt!
[52:36.83]The Chappy Challenge!
[52:47.75]It would suck.
[52:48.43]No, wouldn't it be fun?
[52:50.79]For a minute.
[52:56.81]Oh, this guy again.
[52:58.69]I don't know why I think that's... Never mind.
[53:08.62]He leaves the camera on or something.
[53:10.86]He leaves Hot Mike on.
[53:12.06]That was kind of funny.
[53:19.67]Did you all see when Captain Crunch hot-miked?
[53:26.18]And I'll see you in a moment for some more Captain Crunch gameplay!
[53:29.34]And it's like you hear shuffling, you hear like... Fucking hate this fucking game.
[53:35.02]Stupid fucking Elden Ring, Malenia.
[53:38.34]Piece of fucking garbage.
[53:43.41]I feel like we're not far off from a future like it always takes the corporations like five years to catch on to trends five years from now captain crunch ai generated stream yeah down here Jeremy it's gonna happen I think we go in in this secret tunnel door okay so go on
[54:09.66]Okay.
[54:15.31]Cool.
[54:15.59]Watch out!
[54:17.05]Oh!
[54:20.21]Dude, you just got Crunchitized.
[54:24.49]I wouldn't want Captain Crunch to play a Street Fighter or something, right?
[54:27.72]Are you uncomfortable when the kids in the commercial are like, Crunchitize me, Captain!
[54:31.70]And he's like an old man, and all these kids are super excited to get on his boat alone with him?
[54:37.24]Well, I always thought the Trix rabbit was weird.
[54:39.96]Like, oh, silly rabbit, tricks are for kids.
[54:42.22]And he's just like, oh, give me that box.
[54:44.74]It's like, what, you can't just, why do you have to, like, why can't you just buy one?
[54:51.44]I don't know.
[54:51.84]I got a dragon communion seal.
[54:53.33]Wait, hold on a minute.
[54:54.13]They were taking it from him.
[54:55.53]I got it the wrong way around.
[54:56.37]The kids are stealing it from him.
[54:58.21]Yeah.
[55:01.21]Why?
[55:04.85]Silly rabbit, tricks are for kids.
[55:06.43]Like, he wasn't allowed to eat them.
[55:08.99]yeah and then the rabbit would starve I think there was a different one like the the cookie crisps that was the wolf I think that was trying to steal watch out grandma corner grandma somebody said America is so stupid come on now
[55:37.17]America is so stupid because we have Captain Crunch.
[55:43.22]Captain Crunch is a legend.
[55:52.22]Uh-oh.
[55:54.26]It's the Elden Lord!
[55:57.27]Who is it?
[55:58.95]It's you!
[55:59.69]Oh, it's... Oh, look out!
[56:02.17]Oh my god!
[56:03.09]What the heck?
[56:08.01]Take this!
[56:08.53]My Captain Crunch cereal will knock you out of your park!
[56:12.97]Take that!
[56:14.27]Oh!
[56:14.63]Sir!
[56:16.35]Gotta protect the captain here!
[56:18.75]I could fucking do it!
[56:21.38]Can you?
[56:27.24]Imagine... Captain Crunch becomes like a huge streamer.
[56:34.20]The number one streamer is Captain Crunch?
[56:37.77]I just wouldn't even care.
[56:38.61]I mean, do you care who it is now?
[56:44.26]I mean, I don't even who is like.
[56:45.90]I would care more if it was Captain Crunch.
[56:50.36]That'd be kind of a wild hey.
[56:54.08]VM.
[57:01.51]All the serial mascots have like huge channels.
[57:09.52]That would be so fucked up.
[57:12.68]Ooh.
[57:16.44]Okay, we need to actually look at this stuff.
[57:19.58]Ancestral Star Scourges.
[57:21.44]Prophet Trousers of Grit.
[57:24.59]Yeah, these names are definitely Diablo item names.
[57:26.73]Okay.
[57:32.67]And there's a chest over here.
[57:33.59]I don't think I can really even put these on.
[57:39.57]This is strength.
[57:42.33]Scaling off of intelligence.
[57:43.73]Okay.
[57:45.07]Strengthens death sorceries by 10%.
[57:47.90]Poison moth flight.
[57:49.28]Okay.
[57:51.44]That's kind of cool.
[58:00.34]Mind.
[58:01.30]Plus triggers every 2.8 seconds.
[58:02.50]Plus 1 HP every 3 seconds.
[58:09.33]what the hecky dude strengthens gravity sorceries by 30 yeah they get they get kind of wacky don't they and arc plus three on the same item they do they do for sure get kind of wacky with it okay not that any well I guess some of the gravity spells are pretty strong I don't want to be fat rolling I can't wear this alright
[58:39.62]Why do we start a new run?
[58:40.66]Because we have two new mods on and we're just trying to see how fun it is.
[58:51.25]We have the Diablo II loot.
[58:55.21]And then... Elden Ring reforged and randomizer and seamless co-op.
[59:02.92]Fire damage dealt?
[59:03.84]I mean, I have fire.
[59:05.56]I guess I'll use it, I guess.
[59:16.55]Returning to entrance.
[59:18.03]And you were trying to go faith magic.
[59:21.51]I want to do faith arcane.
[59:23.45]If I can actually figure out how to turn on the warlock class, subclass, whatever it is.
[59:37.32]I'm really not sure we're going to be able to do that.
[59:40.04]Well, it's alright.
[59:45.57]Alright, 15 vigor.
[59:47.67]That's better than 10.
[59:53.91]Still fat rolling.
[59:56.09]There we go.
[59:56.35]Oh my god, I don't know why I thought friendly fire was on.
[60:06.03]See, that was an enjoyable adventure amongst traveling companions.
[60:11.40]It was enjoyable.
[60:13.00]But now we actually have stuff.
[60:16.72]Read the lore on some of the items.
[60:22.27]When every single misbegotten revealed every single misbegotten's greatest falsehood, they wore this legendary restorative foot soldier cap of the mad tongue to show their love for dominula.
[60:32.91]Alright.
[60:35.11]Are they randomized?
[60:36.45]I might be.
[60:37.79]When Margit attacked the Fire Giants, they wore this legendary knight's dialios mask, flaunting their allegiance to Hieta.
[60:48.35]What about this uncommon club?
[60:50.90]When a commander, when a commoner stole a shard of Destined Death, they swung this uncommon club so that the night of the black knives would never reoccur.
[61:00.68]Okay.
[61:01.60]Yeah, they used this ancestral bolt charge club to win the hand of Merchant Kalé.
[61:12.18]When Zorias forged the Elden Ring, they struck their enemies with this common duelist greataxe of the novice mage, but it was not enough to save their trusted friend, Margit.
[61:29.55]Pretty good.
[61:31.27]Ow, what the?
[61:36.35]Not bad, pretty good.
[61:38.55]Alright, cool.
[61:41.70]Say, where do you want to go?
[61:50.29]Far away from that enemy.
[61:51.75]Isn't there usually like an item back here that's relevant?
[61:56.62]We can go do market.
[61:58.12]That was kind of your thing.
[61:59.08]We did my thing.
[61:59.86]We can do your thing.
[62:00.64]We can do trade offs.
[62:02.42]You know, that sounds fun.
[62:05.46]I want to get some spells.
[62:08.99]The Lance Talisman.
[62:14.39]That was a Lance Talisman for me too.
[62:16.07]What does that do?
[62:25.26]Okay.
[62:27.78]To Margit, who is going to be like Millenia.
[62:34.88]That would be very sad.
[62:43.64]Go to the foot of the Erdtree and become Elden Lord now.
[62:50.81]I mean, is there anything else to do?
[62:52.07]I thought that was Kenneth Hyde.
[63:05.85]What's a pot boy on the Hill?
[63:09.05]Anyone out there?
[63:09.69]I'm kind of leading you in a direction that is the opposite direction of Margaret.
[63:17.96]I know that I'm not.
[63:19.32]I know I'm aware, but we don't have to.
[63:21.24]We can just do we do whatever I'm.
[63:22.99]I was kidding when I said we had to do more jump.
[63:26.99]My goodness, I didn't make it.
[63:30.15]And we go this way.
[63:30.71]There's another cave you want to another cave, yeah?
[63:36.22]This is my ancestral great club charged with bolts and it's going to make Merchant Kalé want to marry me.
[63:46.25]The heck are you going?
[63:47.95]I think you gotta go up this.
[63:59.28]Right, I know there's I know there's one here.
[64:01.24]It's probably down here.
[64:10.51]Turtle meat.
[64:14.39]Right here.
[64:16.88]Oh, shush, we don't got any torches.
[64:20.60]Looking like a dark one.
[64:23.40]This is a pretty dark cave.
[64:25.60]And it could be darker.
[64:26.42]I heard you love that game.
[64:32.53]I love Dark and Darker.
[64:34.03]Oh, man.
[64:34.79]I've been addicted, man.
[64:36.12]Like, I really just love when I get the item.
[64:38.64]I think you're just a hater.
[64:40.46]I know.
[64:41.02]I know.
[64:42.76]That's what they all think.
[64:44.86]That's what they're all thinking.
[64:45.88]Do you feel any more Nioh 2?
[64:56.47]yeah I got to like near the end of it they're still the game is very long are you enjoying it what the he grabbed me from such a weird angle uh yeah I was liking it I was just getting a little exhausted I played a lot I had like 60 hours in it I was like I'm I'm I'm doing pretty good on that
[65:23.45]I'm still pressing some Neo buttons while we're playing, but... It happens.
[65:27.59]I don't know what happens.
[65:29.31]Here, you want to go down and then there's a giant vacuous tunnel.
[65:34.30]Only if we go together.
[65:37.42]Just you, me... Grab my hand.
[65:40.06]Captain Crunch, the Cocoa Puffs bird, Tony the Tiger.
[65:46.02]All of us in our party.
[65:51.72]You would collab with... I mean, that's a ton of eyeballs.
[65:57.67]A ton of eyeballs.
[65:58.75]All the Tony the Tiger fans tuning in.
[66:00.87]How many boxes of Frosted Flakes have you ever eaten?
[66:03.38]These are way more famous than anybody on here.
[66:07.54]How much money would you value...
[66:10.85]you specifically you getting uh oh my god there was an explosion person here I just kind of watched uh so you want to spectate or I mean I guess you have to I can't touch the bonfire I I'm you gotta hold the l I mean I'm I respond but oh did you yeah it's very dark down I can't see it's so Dark and Darker it's like someone's been turning all the lights off
[66:42.20]just gonna come down there help help I'm go I'm going back I'm scared anyway how much would you value frosted flakes for life like monetary value okay you're like I I can pay right now to unlock all of the gods and smite but it's actually frosted flakes for life
[67:02.88]I don't really.
[67:03.58]I mean, I don't.
[67:05.10]When you open your cabinet, there will be a fresh box of frosted flakes there whenever you want.
[67:09.73]Did you go down the second?
[67:10.91]Did you go down the second fall?
[67:13.35]Like in the hole?
[67:16.07]I don't know where you are.
[67:17.03]Did you go down the second drop down?
[67:19.41]I'm where you died.
[67:20.85]There's multiple drop downs.
[67:22.43]I destroyed the fire.
[67:24.05]There's a single candle.
[67:27.41]I died right here.
[67:30.00]here here we are hi okay now it's the left you can clearly see that there's a tunnel yeah but what you be saying what was what's the monetary value for that be worth it to me yeah when I open this cabinet it's fill it hold it with every time humble bundle choose your own price but be fair of what the value is
[67:53.17]Well, then I don't care.
[67:56.03]So I open up my cabinet and it's like, I get to decide what I pay for a box of Frosted Flakes today.
[68:00.83]Is that what you're saying?
[68:01.77]No, no, no.
[68:02.31]You pay up front.
[68:03.79]Okay.
[68:04.21]You pay like $100 now if you think that's fair.
[68:06.54]And then you get Frosted Flakes for life.
[68:09.22]Okay.
[68:09.70]But can I give this to other people?
[68:12.20]No.
[68:12.78]That's why I said specifically for you.
[68:15.30]So I can't like open up this cabinet.
[68:16.70]This is Scarlet rotting us in a cave where we can't see.
[68:20.03]Well, you wanted to come down here.
[68:22.85]Don't forget who wanted to come down here.
[68:26.58]I'm just saying we're having this conversation while we're dodging them and not actually fighting them or trying to leave.
[68:31.84]Okay, so here we go.
[68:34.14]If I could give it to people, I would just keep opening the cabinet and just putting boxes and boxes into a storage facility and then people can just take it.
[68:43.03]It would be like a never-ending supply of food, right?
[68:46.38]You cannot do that.
[68:47.38]Stop.
[68:47.68]You're cheating.
[68:50.55]OK, well then so then who cares about?
[68:53.07]I don't like it.
[68:55.73]I can just go get it at the grocery store.
[69:02.40]Who?
[69:04.02]3 HP a second.
[69:04.86]Can I put it on?
[69:09.08]Holy shit, this thing's cool looking.
[69:12.63]Yeah, I had some HP per second pants or something.
[69:21.33]I also have some pants that regenerate FP.
[69:25.02]FP.
[69:26.88]Oh, the pants I have are pretty good.
[69:28.18]It's got bleed.
[69:31.48]I don't think I can really use it.
[69:32.64]I need more strength.
[69:34.12]Okay.
[69:35.08]Make sure you don't die.
[69:35.87]Noob.
[69:38.75]What's the most you would consider paying for one normal size box of Frosted Flakes?
[69:44.35]Yeah, and then multiply that times your life expectancy of like three weeks.
[69:48.75]I don't... I...
[69:53.94]I don't eat that much cereal.
[69:55.72]Dude, I'm getting so many items.
[69:57.74]I know.
[69:58.04]I'm getting like an overwhelming amount of things to look at.
[70:01.58]What?
[70:01.88]There's a big boy.
[70:10.99]I also, I swear...
[70:14.00]one of us killed themselves and put it on easy mode I don't think that happened I I do think that happened well it had to have been you because you're the one that coached me through pressing the buttons oh this thing is a taunt I don't want this either that or like we are getting like mythic god weapon and they're just dealing a ton of damage I think that's probably more accurate
[70:42.39]Where do you drop here?
[70:43.45]You just drop right here?
[70:46.83]I believe you, yes.
[70:51.68]Oh, can you make this jump?
[70:53.56]I hope so.
[71:00.66]Nope.
[71:02.22]God damn it.
[71:03.32]Fucking god damn it.
[71:04.42]This game is absolutely fucking broken.
[71:07.65]How can anybody want to play a game like this, sir?
[71:09.71]It's really great collabing with you.
[71:12.68]Make sure to check out my Kevin Crunch new all-crunchberry cereal.
[71:16.58]God damn it.
[71:21.88]Ah!
[71:23.87]I... You couldn't make the jump.
[71:26.09]I... Wait, I'm up here.
[71:30.27]I'll make it.
[71:34.53]No, this is fine.
[71:35.17]I thought I was going to get knocked down, like, away from everything.
[71:44.20]Good save.
[71:45.26]Thanks.
[71:46.38]Yeah, good save.
[71:51.18]What was that?
[71:53.10]Stop doing that.
[71:56.00]He's gonna keep doing that.
[72:01.64]OK.
[72:05.72]So you don't like frosted flakes?
[72:07.89]As the too long didn't read.
[72:10.91]I don't eat that much cereal.
[72:12.51]Okay, what do you eat?
[72:15.87]If you don't eat cereal, what... Uh-oh.
[72:18.15]What that?
[72:19.49]I don't know.
[72:24.18]Oh, I thought... I thought that was one of those things that, like, shoot you from the ceiling.
[72:28.20]Oh, no.
[72:28.64]It's an Albinauric!
[72:35.15]There's supposed to be something going on in here.
[72:37.65]There's usually a giganto octa in here.
[72:44.85]Ooh, nice teamwork.
[72:48.71]Nice.
[72:53.81]I can't believe you wanted to come in here without even getting a lantern.
[72:57.33]Well, how hard would it be to talk to you to tell you that I want to go buy the lantern from the specific lantern spot before you got distracted?
[73:06.74]Two minutes.
[73:11.66]Are we going to drop here?
[73:13.14]This is the right way.
[73:20.73]Oh, this is the right way.
[73:26.01]Top yourself off.
[73:27.63]Don't be an idiot.
[73:30.67]What do you mean taunt myself off?
[73:32.53]Heals.
[73:33.86]Don't be an idiot.
[73:34.90]I'm full HP.
[73:37.18]Okay, you ready?
[73:40.08]Are we both using club?
[73:41.34]Yeah, because it's the only thing we can both use.
[73:44.00]Okay.
[73:47.04]We need stats.
[73:50.12]Guardian Gary Garris.
[73:52.62]Oh no, it's Gary.
[73:54.50]Of course, Gary.
[73:56.20]Who could forget?
[73:58.70]Wait, it's Gary and a bunch of other, what?
[74:01.64]I don't know what these are.
[74:03.14]It's motorbike snails.
[74:06.24]Gary.
[74:07.30]Alright, these things are actually kind of dangerous.
[74:14.43]This is definitely on easy for me.
[74:16.79]What do you mean on easy?
[74:19.83]Reborn has like a difficulty setting and I must have picked one.
[74:25.05]I don't know.
[74:28.54]What is that?
[74:36.81]Oh, fuck off, Gary.
[74:43.77]Oh, don't call me Guardian Garrus.
[74:45.59]My friends call me Gary.
[74:47.05]OK.
[74:54.08]I got a bunch of shit.
[74:59.43]okay this is more sorceries um okay what about this Golden Order incantations stamina regen by eight percent that's actually kind of good but no but I've got the planets
[75:28.88]the way I love that weapon do you want this baby rattle that is also the moon veil or no this is just a regular katana attack I use that in my regular playthrough it's pretty fun um I don't think I wanted to act like a katana though that seems really kind of bad okay well you're bad we gotta go to a bonfire and make sure it's not on easy mode
[76:00.99]Starting to understand it.
[76:01.65]I get it.
[76:07.06]We just need stats first so we can actually put some of this stuff on.
[76:10.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:14.76]This is physical damage.
[76:18.48]Physical damage.
[76:19.80]We got to teleport.
[76:21.42]Has to happen.
[76:24.62]Okay, hold on.
[76:27.49]Alright, let's go.
[76:29.49]I posted pictures of the mods menu trees in the Discord.
[76:33.11]What?
[76:34.35]A hero?
[76:36.04]A hero is the right word.
[76:40.32]Oh, they're fully like labeled with like red lines on what they lead to.
[76:45.04]Really?
[76:46.34]Jesus.
[76:47.00]Wow, that's actually amazing.
[76:53.95]This has the stomp.
[76:57.98]Isn't this thing insane?
[76:59.84]Ster, this thing is like broken, right?
[77:03.36]They nerfed it a lot, but it is very strong.
[77:05.64]Okay.
[77:07.96]I'll take it.
[77:12.62]Oh, hold up.
[77:14.35]That's why I was confused earlier.
[77:16.79]Yeah.
[77:20.35]We don't have a fortunes menu that we're supposed to have.
[77:28.07]I don't know what enables that to exist.
[77:30.49]I thought you had it from the beginning in Reforge, but underneath flasks, it's supposed to be fortunes and we don't have it.
[77:35.70]Okay.
[77:37.52]And I don't know why not.
[77:38.58]I think we need an item, somebody said.
[77:47.44]You need an item and you buy it from Kael.
[77:52.81]Okay, let's go warp to Kael.
[77:54.03]Okay.
[78:01.05]Oracle's effigy is what we need.
[78:08.08]Trying to go there.
[78:08.96]It's doing that thing.
[78:09.78]I can't go.
[78:11.44]We'll have to try it again.
[78:12.07]Nope.
[78:19.48]Wait, is it earlier than Kale?
[78:20.66]An item you pick up at the first bonfire after you go up the elevator.
[78:24.66]Yeah, we just ran right past that.
[78:26.53]Oh, so like the graveyard or like the first step?
[78:29.83]The first step.
[78:30.51]Okay.
[78:40.63]Oh.
[78:40.81]Oh.
[78:42.81]Hmm.
[78:42.89]I don't know.
[78:46.51]I thought there was an item down there usually.
[78:48.59]Hmm.
[78:51.09]I'm starting to understand it.
[78:51.79]I'm starting to get it.
[78:53.85]It was a lot of overwhelming items and stuff.
[78:56.50]I think I'm getting it.
[79:02.26]It's supposed to be that first stake.
[79:03.94]We might have gotten it somewhere else then.
[79:08.04]Okay.
[79:11.37]I think somebody tried to give me directions very early on.
[79:13.57]Is there an item there for you?
[79:15.79]There was, but I think it was just the...
[79:19.43]Can I pick it up just absentmindedly?
[79:24.11]I know that the item that is usually there we picked up like in that dungeon because it's usually like a furled finger or something.
[79:33.62]I don't see anything new.
[79:35.56]You buy it from Kayle on the patch you're currently on.
[79:38.14]It's there on the newer patches.
[79:39.89]Okay.
[79:40.49]Okay.
[79:40.85]Yeah, we're on an old patch so that it works with Diablo items.
[79:45.61]Okay.
[79:46.69]So now let's just get over there then.
[79:57.75]My mom brought me fish sticks and garlic bread.
[79:59.91]This rules.
[80:00.81]That sounds pretty good, actually.
[80:03.59]He's not selling anything particularly interesting.
[80:06.81]No?
[80:11.09]No, not really.
[80:14.93]Yeah, we had to do a bunch of goofy shit to get these to even run together, so maybe we just can't do it.
[80:25.73]Eh, that's alright.
[80:29.80]I could buy a torch though.
[80:36.89]I do want to level up.
[80:49.83]I want to do Faith and Arcane.
[80:52.19]But I'm kind of scared that my Endurance is literally 8.
[80:55.47]So I'm going to fix that.
[81:23.29]Okay, sit down for a second.
[81:25.11]Reforge is not really compatible with randomizer plus DSL.
[81:31.40]Just with, okay.
[81:34.08]Okay, do event text foretalk the top one.
[81:36.52]Okay.
[81:38.70]Then do the top one.
[81:41.38]Okay.
[81:44.16]Then three down.
[81:50.05]So you mean like one, two, three.
[81:51.90]The fourth one.
[81:52.70]Yeah.
[81:53.00]The fourth one, three down.
[81:54.10]Okay.
[81:54.52]Say yes.
[81:55.56]Then say yes.
[81:56.92]What the fuck?
[81:57.86]Ow.
[82:00.32]What did you do?
[82:01.98]That you have to die, but that's to change the difficulty.
[82:04.76]The difficulty changing kills you so you don't like carry over souls or I don't know what their rules are, but that made sure that we're both like on actual.
[82:12.70]There's a normal difficulty.
[82:13.96]We're on adept mode.
[82:15.70]Okay.
[82:15.94]We're co-oping.
[82:16.60]Like, why not?
[82:17.18]Oh, don't look at Ronnie.
[82:19.07]when you respawn.
[82:19.91]Are you actually being serious?
[82:27.26]You're not being serious, right?
[82:28.72]I'm not.
[82:29.16]I'm not.
[82:29.42]I'm not being serious.
[82:34.29]You're such a joker.
[82:39.51]One too many mods.
[82:41.11]I forgot I left that one in for my personal archives.
[82:45.25]Oh, Ronnie.
[82:45.91]Will you shut the fuck up?
[82:49.98]Belle's over there.
[82:57.99]Ring my bell.
[83:00.35]So I got this new item.
[83:02.37]Thing's got that frost stomp.
[83:03.75]I think we'd be able to stomp through the castle.
[83:07.62]Goes a little bit like a whabam!
[83:09.06]It goes a little bit like a whabam!
[83:10.34]It goes a little bit like a whabam!
[83:13.06]Damn, you looking like a bro.
[83:15.44]Thanks.
[83:16.62]You were scaling Intelligence and Arcane, you said?
[83:19.34]I'm doing Arcane and Faith.
[83:22.06]I want to do Frenzied, Fire, the Three Fingers.
[83:26.88]So if I had like a faith arcane weapon, I would probably use it.
[83:37.30]If you had it.
[83:42.70]OK.
[83:44.08]He would probably use it.
[83:49.13]How about we go kill Margo?
[83:52.59]I think we could.
[83:54.47]At this stage.
[84:03.35]What did that do?
[84:05.01]It's a bow.
[84:06.29]Okay.
[84:09.81]I have a strengthens night sorceries by 30%.
[84:11.83]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[84:14.60]I just got a lot of... I didn't look at one or two things because there's like... They're throwing a million items at us.
[84:26.92]Okay.
[84:28.34]Alright.
[84:29.02]Let me buy some arrows.
[84:30.94]I'm going to keep the strength one on.
[84:35.46]I'm poor.
[84:36.02]Never mind.
[84:36.50]I bought one arrow.
[84:38.58]Okay.
[84:39.16]Let's teleport to Stormhill Shack.
[84:41.78]Yeah.
[84:43.18]And let's go fight Margit.
[84:45.14]Why not?
[84:52.82]Yeah.
[84:53.12]Why not?
[84:53.90]I can't wait to open up Margit and it's going to be Shrek.
[84:58.07]Is our warp not working again?
[85:01.29]It does it sometimes.
[85:01.95]Do it again.
[85:08.58]Hey, how about we go down here to this cave?
[85:11.56]We could do that too.
[85:12.98]Hey, follow me.
[85:15.03]The universe was telling me through its bizarre powers.
[85:17.71]You need the dingleberry drinker mod if you want to drink.
[85:19.93]Yeah.
[85:22.66]I'm sad the classes thing is so goofed.
[85:31.27]Yeah, the new gimmick for this stream here, we have the Diablo II Ludon, a new randomizer seed, and then Elden Ring Reforged, which we probably can't use some of the stuff with it, but we're just trying to, we're just checking it out, you know?
[85:46.04]Yeah, it's a pretty big overhaul.
[85:47.98]We're checking it out.
[85:48.63]We're just seeing what happens.
[86:03.69]I mean, anything could happen at any moment.
[86:11.26]Even right now, something could be happening that we don't know about.
[86:18.31]Well, this weapon is probably way better.
[86:20.05]I'm going to be doing that frost stomp.
[86:22.93]It's going to be so insane.
[86:25.33]You don't even have any idea.
[86:27.61]Frenzied Flame doesn't scale with Arcane.
[86:30.47]The... Oh, wait.
[86:31.97]Okay, so the Warlock class that I can't choose scales Frenzied Flame with... It changes things, but I can't do that, so... Alright, I need to figure out what I'm gonna do.
[86:42.39]Um... Shit.
[86:44.29]Hold on.
[86:46.75]How do I... You can't drop it from the equipment menu, right?
[86:49.25]I think it has to be in your inventory.
[86:55.86]It's just Faith?
[86:56.52]Okay, cool.
[87:02.96]It's still decent.
[87:05.36]Well, it lights up the hallway, so that's helpful.
[87:08.58]I'm curious if this is good for you.
[87:09.82]I dropped a weapon here.
[87:16.22]Ancestral Tempered Lightning Vikes Warspear.
[87:24.78]Okay.
[87:26.92]Three in, three arcane.
[87:28.52]Stamina minus 18%.
[87:31.68]I need I don't have the stats for it, but I'll definitely keep it on.
[87:36.98]OK, cool.
[87:40.39]Oh, yeah, I'll use it eventually.
[87:46.03]Let's let's explore this cave.
[87:48.05]Oh, I have another faith one.
[87:49.49]Actually, this one might also be cool.
[87:51.84]I'm just going to drop it.
[87:52.52]You can look at it later.
[87:54.20]Yeah, just wait.
[87:54.80]No, I didn't drop it.
[87:55.58]Never mind.
[87:56.14]Let's just let's just go.
[87:57.56]Let's just let's just let's just game.
[88:02.69]Game on.
[88:03.99]Oh, I have FP regen.
[88:09.38]I mean, this is like kind of alright, I think.
[88:13.48]I mean, you killed shit that was not on the screen.
[88:15.68]I did.
[88:17.24]I'll be torch guy.
[88:24.17]It's not really helping, but it's kind of doing stuff.
[88:27.13]It's like staggering people.
[88:34.58]It's okay.
[88:35.94]It's not bad.
[88:39.64]This is the ancient ancestral dragon's torch of light seeing.
[88:42.91]Is that what it actually is called?
[88:45.51]No, I made that one up.
[88:48.01]Demi-human chief soldier.
[88:50.95]Watch out.
[88:58.14]Are you sure it's not?
[88:58.76]Are you putting it on easy?
[89:04.30]Okay.
[89:05.04]Rare.
[89:05.40]I'm sure.
[89:06.12]Rare lightning night rider flail of shadow walking.
[89:10.73]Treasured talisman of restoration.
[89:12.55]Treasured minor invigorating bloodhound.
[89:14.89]That guy dropped like his whole house.
[89:19.89]This guy was moving.
[89:21.20]He had a U-Haul in this freaking little room.
[89:25.48]Okay.
[89:25.94]Hold on a minute.
[89:28.60]Look at that.
[89:29.20]Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[89:31.58]Strengthens Frenzied Flame incantations by 10%.
[89:37.98]Where do you usually get your first Frenzied Flame?
[89:40.10]Because like the item, that's not random.
[89:42.14]We can go get that for you.
[89:43.39]I just want them all.
[89:46.37]That's what I mean.
[89:47.29]We can go get them.
[89:48.85]I've never done it, so I don't really know where they are.
[89:52.65]Well, I'm sure someone in your chat will make a fully fleshed out diagram of
[89:58.74]labeled and put it in the Discord.
[90:02.85]Which one of these is more efficient?
[90:04.61]3 FP every 2.5 or 4 FP every 3.5?
[90:08.81]Which one mathematically gets you more?
[90:13.40]And you don't want to play Path of Exile?
[90:15.06]No.
[90:16.02]You're going to ask that question and you don't want to play.
[90:19.22]Okay, but we just got a lot of stuff.
[90:28.34]Four HP, fire damage.
[90:31.12]I'm going to keep that one on.
[90:32.01]Alright, cool.
[90:32.91]Oh, this is fun.
[90:33.59]I like this.
[90:33.99]This is actually really cool.
[90:38.35]Yeah, I didn't expect like this much to get thrown at us.
[90:43.14]I think it was very easy to get very confused and overwhelmed in the first like 45 minutes to an hour.
[90:47.24]So I think we're good.
[90:48.30]Did you go back to that or did you go through?
[90:50.16]I ran up to the dragon communion area and that's all like all that's all the same.
[90:55.06]So we can go warp to the shack now.
[90:57.40]Do the shack.
[90:58.76]Let me just.
[90:59.62]Yeah.
[91:00.66]Because if you have it, then I should have it too then, right?
[91:04.92]The shack.
[91:06.60]I love this shack.
[91:08.98]You got a shadow walking weapon.
[91:13.13]OK.
[91:14.53]I wonder what that does.
[91:18.84]yeah these mods are funny this this armor strengthens bestial incantations by ten percent strengthens bestial incantations by ten percent neat it just does them both but they're the same when the Frenzied Flame left grand sacks behind they presented this rare madman skeletal mask of the Fire Giants to hide among the peasants fleeing Limgrave
[91:45.39]That's pretty crazy lore.
[91:48.25]Let me level up.
[91:56.73]I'm going to just dump it into... Let's get Vigor up to 20 before we make any decisions.
[92:05.62]Alright, Margit.
[92:07.04]Hold on.
[92:07.90]Sit back down.
[92:09.05]back down are we doing another uh we are are we doing another uh kill ourselves difficulty change yes okay because there is a co-op difficulties and I feel like that might be overriding though it doesn't have an easy it only has normal and hard and master it like that should be fine okay uh hold on
[92:40.76]A Frenzied Flame.
[92:45.16]A Frenzied Flame.
[92:58.18]Read more descriptions.
[93:03.14]When Hayate joined the militia protecting Farum Azula, they donned this Treasured Emboldened Talisman of Restoration as they liked how it looked.
[93:11.63]That's it.
[93:12.21]That's all the lore.
[93:14.45]Knights on horseback are deadly foes.
[93:16.83]They see all below from their lofty position, meeting little meaningful resistance as they charge ahead.
[93:22.88]That's accurate.
[93:33.60]Yeah, they liked it.
[93:37.26]They liked the way it looked.
[93:45.55]You'll get that.
[93:47.83]Come on.
[93:50.69]I got it.
[93:51.58]Nice.
[93:56.42]Watch out.
[93:56.78]It's the perfect human.
[94:03.84]Alright, Margit.
[94:08.98]What do you got?
[94:17.89]I deleted them.
[94:19.85]I killed him.
[94:20.87]Alright, who's in here?
[94:22.13]Put your foolish ambitions to rest.
[94:31.06]Skip.
[94:31.68]We already know that he's...
[94:33.61]Oh, Leonine Misbegotten the Fel Omen.
[94:40.45]I was like perma-stunned.
[94:42.13]I don't know what happened.
[94:44.19]I was mashing roll and I never rolled.
[94:48.33]You got this.
[94:48.97]Whoa, how come I didn't roll?
[94:55.24]Excuse me.
[94:58.02]Excuse me?
[95:11.97]No!
[95:13.07]I'm fine.
[95:22.86]What the?
[95:23.34]No, no, no.
[95:23.80]Really, though?
[95:24.34]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[95:25.22]Really, though?
[95:26.66]No, no, no.
[95:27.04]Really, though?
[95:27.58]What?
[95:28.34]I didn't dodge through that?
[95:30.71]Like really though, huh really though I dodged right into it like there was no iframe You saw do you literally saw that dick that was free spent that that has me very concerned because I saw a lot of people on the reforge saying that Their dodge rolls had no iframes The mod you're using removes iframes no it does not does it I
[95:55.50]I know that you can stand still and roll and you do this move and that definitely has iframes.
[96:00.03]Wait, hold on.
[96:00.69]There's a different dodge?
[96:03.81]I know that dodges, but I think I thought dodges still could dodge.
[96:11.97]The iframes are different in the mod.
[96:13.90]Should we try this?
[96:16.56]When you change difficulties, like hard changes the amount of iframes you have.
[96:21.56]What?
[96:21.90]Let me try the new one.
[96:23.24]But that didn't really help.
[96:30.02]That didn't work.
[96:30.54]Really?
[96:41.06]Yeah, there are not iframes.
[96:46.76]Good luck.
[96:50.81]I just got lucky on that.
[96:52.01]That was too early.
[96:59.43]How do you play a FromSoftware game without iframes?
[97:04.45]That seems like, oh, mega difficult.
[97:10.00]We have to parry everything?
[97:17.00]My game crashed.
[97:24.05]There probably is iframes, but it's probably... Somebody just said in chat, and this is true.
[97:28.41]Yeah, I don't want to do this.
[97:31.19]I would like to remove that, because we're going to change our muscle memory completely, and it's going to ruin every single other game you ever play.
[97:39.90]Wait, what's going to ruin your muscle memory?
[97:41.72]If there are iframes and we have to learn where they are, then we're never going to be able to play Elden Ring ever again normally.
[97:48.80]They're supposed to be the same on normal.
[97:51.92]I did have us choose adept, so maybe the iframes are like slightly changed and we should just switch back to normal mode.
[98:00.11]If that were the case.
[98:04.09]But I did see a lot of people in the mod comments being like, hey,
[98:08.52]My dodge doesn't work.
[98:12.58]And I was kind of praying like that won't happen to us.
[98:16.30]I'm opening my world to you and I'm going to walk you through choosing normal mode.
[98:20.70]Okay.
[98:23.30]Plus it's way harder.
[98:24.02]Plus it's way harder this way.
[98:25.26]It'll be easier to play the regular game.
[98:29.50]It's just tighter iframes.
[98:30.74]Wouldn't that just make you better at the game?
[98:34.75]No, I don't think so, because then you lose the opportunity to dodge with more iframes.
[98:41.89]And I think it would actually make you play worse, because if there's only one way to dodge in getting that perfect iframe, then when you play normally, it's like you're going to get hit because you did it wrong.
[98:51.45]You know what I mean?
[98:52.37]You get it.
[98:58.62]Why is she here?
[99:00.08]She wants me.
[99:01.64]I have to go to the round table.
[99:03.90]Yep.
[99:08.42]Melina, can you go away?
[99:13.69]No, she's mine.
[99:19.63]You're just touching me.
[99:27.34]Alright.
[99:28.96]What incantations do you have?
[99:31.43]Okay.
[99:32.19]Flame ones for losers.
[99:42.01]Flame sling.
[99:42.83]Flame fortification.
[99:44.95]Heal.
[99:48.51]I don't want to heal.
[99:49.27]I just want like the Frenzied Flame.
[99:54.01]Catch flame.
[99:54.71]Eh.
[99:56.25]Flame sling.
[99:59.67]Catch flame is godlike.
[100:02.21]May the Golden Order.
[100:04.62]We need to exhaust some dialog here, right?
[100:21.78]You're new for no matter how you.
[100:28.25]So we have we both of the Smithing Stone change, but we only need one, so that's good.
[100:35.67]Yeah, yeah.
[100:41.46]Although I don't really have enough money.
[100:47.50]Sell random items.
[100:50.83]Could.
[100:52.01]Yeah, that's I guess I'll just upgrade the hell out of this thing.
[100:57.53]And again, the Diablo items only need to be upgraded twice, and that's their max.
[101:02.43]Okay.
[101:03.43]But upgrading a mythic or whatever is better than upgrading a common, and they require bigger stones.
[101:12.53]So this is like a lifesteal with lightning damage, dex weapon.
[101:17.92]Eh, just get rid of it.
[101:18.68]I don't want it.
[101:24.38]Strength +2 poison moth flight.
[101:28.30]Strength.
[101:34.18]Holy shit.
[101:35.70]This thing, I'm going to hold on to this because it's kind of crazy.
[101:38.51]Okay, so I got a +2.
[101:56.65]Yeah, I'm ready to go.
[101:58.09]Yeah, I'm ready to.
[102:00.22]Although I do want, wait, I do want to buy this other thing.
[102:02.76]Be quiet.
[102:06.32]I want to get this catch flame.
[102:26.31]This is good.
[102:27.95]I've never done any of this before.
[102:28.97]I don't know.
[102:29.37]Is it any good?
[102:33.94]I don't know.
[102:35.64]A lot of it, again, with Reforged is balanced differently.
[102:40.84]Sparks flame from hand.
[102:41.98]Okay.
[102:47.86]I'll try it.
[102:49.74]I am ready to go back to market.
[102:53.02]We have better weapons now.
[102:55.87]I mean, you do.
[102:58.94]Oh, wait.
[102:59.26]The actual shop.
[103:00.36]I wonder if there's anything there.
[103:03.22]It's not random.
[103:04.72]So, no.
[103:05.78]It's not random.
[103:06.72]Okay.
[103:10.84]Let's go.
[103:18.89]Okay.
[103:20.61]And then when you get here, we're going to sit back down and we're going to normal mode and hope
[103:25.58]that uh it has something to do with the dodge frames that's what we can hope I feel like I've dodged things I don't know at what point what happened um event text the top one okay a top one down two yes okay hitting yes
[103:58.35]What did you do?
[103:58.73]What did you do?
[103:59.25]What did you do?
[103:59.79]Oh, my God.
[104:00.21]What did you do?
[104:01.36]I messed up.
[104:02.44]You fucking idiot.
[104:08.12]God.
[104:08.58]Wrong one.
[104:17.43]God.
[104:21.19]I hope we can dodge.
[104:22.45]Making me so angry.
[104:28.39]Alright.
[104:29.31]Because I don't buy that there's like, oh, there's a smaller amount of dodge frames because I was it didn't even look like I was rolling the way I was getting hit.
[104:37.13]Like, I must have been hitting them pretty early to not even roll at all.
[104:40.08]Go.
[104:45.46]Test it.
[104:48.12]I have iframes again.
[104:56.26]Yeah, I do as well.
[105:08.60]Maybe.
[105:09.64]Ish.
[105:10.70]Well, it's enough for us to kill him.
[105:12.76]Yeah, it's enough.
[105:13.34]Okay.
[105:35.18]We got it.
[105:38.18]Ooh.
[105:38.62]Spellblade gloves.
[105:40.16]Talisman.
[105:41.27]Talisman.
[105:46.63]Carrying swords.
[105:47.35]Sorceries.
[106:01.76]Dude, Wild Strike, I forgot, is like... He can't stop you.
[106:08.88]So is magic damage fire damage or is it fire damage?
[106:11.50]Because I guess I should just put this on.
[106:12.66]It's fire damage.
[106:13.94]Okay.
[106:20.49]Alright.
[106:20.79]Well, now I can level up.
[106:21.67]Now the question becomes this.
[106:24.05]I'm not going to blow up my character again.
[106:27.15]I'm trying to do Frenzied Flame.
[106:29.43]So is that just only Faith?
[106:32.56]I want it to be like the eyes burning and everything like that.
[106:36.69]I believe that would only be Faith.
[106:40.19]So I should do Faith and then enough Strength and Dex to put whatever item I want.
[106:47.63]And then just Vigor and Endurance.
[106:51.16]Vigor is a pretty good ability.
[106:53.68]People like Vigor.
[106:57.58]You should look at Fextralife like a normal person.
[107:00.26]I don't think you know what we have activated.
[107:06.66]Every item is completely random.
[107:11.82]Could be anything.
[107:17.33]Magic damage isn't fire, bro.
[107:19.51]I don't think you understand what's going on right now.
[107:25.25]Guys, I don't think you understand the type of danger that you're in.
[107:28.38]I don't think you get it.
[107:30.18]Uh, I think I'm just gonna go... Let's just do... Vigor and Endurance.
[107:34.75]I gotta get these out of the way.
[107:35.71]It's so low.
[107:36.43]Your mom walks in the room, opens the door behind you, and looks at your computer and sees that, oh, is that jermaOn the screen?
[107:42.13]And she's blushing.
[107:43.15]And you're like, why is my mom blushing at Jerma?
[107:45.09]Oh, is that Jerma?
[107:51.39]And she sits down next to you and she's like, I want to watch this.
[107:54.98]And she tells you to get out.
[107:57.94]Huh?
[107:58.26]Huh?
[108:02.36]what mom that's my computer shall I turn your room oh my god what the okay cool you there come over here would you kill him you I would admit tightly the cards don't you breach the
[108:31.43]Nice.
[108:47.37]Got that guy.
[108:51.17]You steal 30% of our runes when we're in this area.
[108:53.73]Don't act like you don't know.
[108:55.26]Wait, do we need him to open up this gate?
[108:56.94]Does he need to do that?
[109:00.80]Does he need to like whistle and tell them to open it?
[109:02.64]Yeah.
[109:08.92]Because it would be very helpful if it was open.
[109:11.46]It's not open and it won't ever will be.
[109:14.48]Okay.
[109:17.66]What did I do wrong?
[109:18.60]I just steal 30% of your runes.
[109:29.02]Okay, so.
[109:32.03]I want to get more arcane, I think.
[109:33.73]No, no, no.
[109:34.99]No, no, no, no, no.
[109:39.68]But on Fextralife, where do you get your first frenzied ability?
[109:45.64]I could just look it up, I guess.
[109:47.48]Like a normal person.
[109:49.93]It won't be there, will it?
[109:52.51]It will.
[109:53.21]Items are not random.
[109:53.91]I just got common Frenzied Flame seal of the frenzied fire.
[109:57.09]It just was right here.
[110:06.10]do it you won't you don't have the ball yeah he wasn't even attacking oh his friend yeah I think it's that this club is like ancestral quality this ancestral club and it's just dealing bonkers damage
[110:26.68]right I got the Frenzied Flame strengthens fire monk and giants flame incantations that doesn't help me watch out that's not even a seal that I want to use
[110:54.44]I want things that add to Frenzied Flame incantations.
[111:00.66]Eventually, I mean.
[111:05.93]Oh my god.
[111:07.21]I'm running.
[111:11.65]I've been murdered.
[111:15.89]Oh boy, that's bad.
[111:17.46]That's a one-hit kill.
[111:28.64]So that's interesting.
[111:29.38]That hurts.
[111:30.20]That is pretty interesting, isn't it?
[111:34.82]Dude, that kid's mom is pouting right now.
[111:45.58]So how close do I have to be for that?
[111:47.30]Can that hit things from... Very close.
[111:50.66]That's like closer than some melee weapons.
[111:52.78]Yeah, this thing stinks, doesn't it?
[111:54.76]It does good damage, but you do have to be very close.
[111:58.85]my god that is a lot and you can uh you can like chain cast it multiple times it has to dramatically just fall off it's really good uh though there is one that's like identical that's like greater flame that has a little bit more aoe now get on my way watch out that thing's a one-hit kill it hit me three times
[112:30.15]I'm coming One of us will hit you I promise Yeah, we got to go open that door Poison well

[113:30.18]This thing is pretty good.
[113:36.02]Curved sword talisman.
[113:37.42]What's that do?
[113:40.10]It's normal to be a little curved.
[113:41.54]Oh.
[113:42.96]Okay.
[113:46.46]Rusty key.
[113:47.70]Yep.
[113:52.41]So this specific buff criteria for Frenzy Flame.
[113:56.99]Someone in the mod chat will help me.
[114:05.54]My mom said you suck at this game, but Ster is amazing.
[114:13.95]Thanks, mom.
[114:14.57]Your mother didn't say that.
[114:16.43]Well, you're going the wrong way.
[114:17.74]I want to kill this guy.
[114:22.24]Man, I love it when you blow little kisses at your enemies.
[114:26.36]There's an item over here.
[114:27.30]You don't want it?
[114:30.75]I mean, it feels like everything's going to be hard to compete with Diablo.
[114:34.43]I guess these were Diablo.
[114:37.31]You got me there, man.
[114:38.53]That rare tower was made of emboldening.
[114:41.47]Stamina regen 8%.
[114:42.19]Yeah.
[114:43.08]Good thing I picked that up.
[114:49.20]Yeah, sorry.
[114:57.90]Okay, let's go.
[115:07.61]Pretty good.
[115:08.43]Alright, I'm just gonna stack Faith now, because this thing will just kill things.
[115:20.33]Oh, Mod Chat is like, what are you talking about?
[115:22.08]Okay, let me... I didn't even know what you were talking about.
[115:25.66]Let me get you guys up to speed.
[115:27.28]So, what is the buff criteria for Frenzied Flame stuff?
[115:31.55]Somebody put a big paragraph in the chat and I couldn't read it.
[115:35.09]I don't even know what the phrase buff criteria is.
[115:38.71]There's apparently specific buff criteria to make Frenzy Flame do more damage.
[115:44.98]It was spam.
[115:46.42]Oh.
[115:49.82]No idea what you're talking about.
[115:50.96]What they are talking about.
[115:54.38]I understand.
[115:55.08]There's no buff criteria.
[115:57.63]The seal that I use is Frenzied Flame.
[115:59.91]Does it get buffed from, you know, Fire Giant incantation buffs?
[116:06.97]That's a weird looking wall.
[116:09.13]Use the Frenzied Seal and level Faith.
[116:13.69]You gonna do the Jerma Skip?
[116:15.71]Yeah, the original Jerma Skip.
[116:17.25]I made this up.
[116:23.21]Patented it.
[116:24.27]Patented it-ed-ed.
[116:32.38]Okay.
[116:53.20]Watch out!
[116:53.54]Electric!
[116:54.52]Electricity!
[116:58.72]Flame grant me strength buffs fire damage and the fire damage physique tier.
[117:03.04]Okay.
[117:07.48]Frenzy flame seal buffs frenzy flame incantations.
[117:09.88]I think it's fairly obvious.
[117:12.29]Well, but that's not what it says.
[117:14.57]Because this is the Diablo II loot version of it.
[117:21.88]The base seal itself is still the same.
[117:23.92]Okay.
[117:24.90]So the stuff that it says on it are additional modifiers that it has besides the fact that it is the Frenzied Flame scaling talisman.
[117:32.38]Okay.
[117:32.94]So that was my question.
[117:33.92]It has been answered completely, and I am very satisfied with my new grab of gear.
[117:39.12]Okay.
[117:40.12]He jumped.
[117:41.72]Don't take any fall damage in this mod.
[117:44.34]Really?
[117:46.51]I don't really.
[117:47.09]I'm just going to say that because I hope it's true.
[117:48.89]I didn't.
[117:49.31]I didn't take any either.
[117:49.97]I really feel like I should have.
[117:52.43]I am the frenzied club.
[117:55.42]Oh fuck.
[118:01.22]Yeah, am I wearing like?
[118:02.20]Yeah, that I got fire and ice.
[118:16.35]You're like an anime character.
[118:17.83]Oh, I took off the regen gloves.
[118:27.32]That was stupid of me.
[118:30.47]Common Acts of Godfrey.
[118:32.67]What?
[118:36.83]Okay, cool.
[118:38.65]No, I'm not going strength this time.
[118:39.91]Oh yeah, common acts of Godfrey.
[118:41.69]He goes to the grocery store, goes to the bathroom.
[118:45.79]-2.
[118:46.37]Do you make chicken nuggets or a tuna sandwich?
[118:53.58]I'm going to go with tuna.
[118:57.08]I would go with tuna.
[118:59.26]You don't think people that like tuna are freaks?
[119:02.87]No, and you know what?
[119:03.43]I'm really kind of sick of this weird bullshit where if you like tuna fish sandwiches, something's wrong with you that I've seen.
[119:11.67]Are you one of those people?
[119:13.69]I am one of those people because fish is kind of gross.
[119:18.80]And then you mush it up.
[119:20.38]You're like a mushed up fish.
[119:25.26]How do you think they make a chicken patty?
[119:29.97]You got me there.
[119:33.06]actually and crab cakes are pretty solid you got you got me what about like how do you eat hot dogs yeah I mean I I I I take this l and I accept that I've been exposed yeah good good I think it's freaking me out it's flying weird
[120:02.04]I don't think my bow works or maybe those arrows don't work the way I think they are sleep cane oh my goodness there's so many things
[120:29.66]I think once we get to a bonfire, it's a look at what I have for gear situation.
[120:34.72]How do we normally... You got to come in here to open this, right?
[120:37.92]Yep.
[120:42.27]Ster humbly accepting an L is actually a W. I mean, I still think that...
[120:47.88]Tuna fish is disgusting, but I see how my specific line of thought to why it was disgusting is misguided.
[120:55.86]But the thing is, I feel like people that say tuna is disgusting had a gross tuna at one point.
[121:02.95]A great childhood and a great understanding of what food really is, and they weren't fed mush as children.
[121:13.16]Because, you know, there's like chunk light tuna.
[121:16.52]There's light tuna.
[121:17.90]There's solid tuna.
[121:19.48]And there's a tier system with tuna fish off the shelf at the grocery store.
[121:24.36]Chunk light tuna is... I do not like it.
[121:27.75]It's kind of disgusting.
[121:31.39]I actually don't like it at all.
[121:34.23]I think to describe it as chunk light has already got me pretty...
[121:39.25]Chunk Light Tuna is... It's not... I do not like it.
[121:43.08]It's way too... It's just... It's not good.
[121:46.88]It's pretty bad.
[121:51.95]Do a poll if you like tuna.
[121:54.03]What's the good one?
[121:55.79]Solid albacore tuna.
[121:58.65]It's solid white albacore tuna.
[122:02.30]Like actual fish, not like mush.
[122:05.52]Chunk light tuna.
[122:06.90]I don't know what the scale is, but it's a lower quality.
[122:10.71]I don't know the words you're using.
[122:13.43]It's just to determine, like, the quality and the scale of the ingredients.
[122:17.44]I don't know.
[122:17.90]It's just chunk light tuna.
[122:19.60]It just means it, like, sucks.
[122:20.66]Do they really?
[122:21.78]Is that a real term or your term?
[122:23.14]No, no.
[122:23.40]That's a real term.
[122:24.44]That is actually on.
[122:25.22]Chunk light.
[122:25.98]Yes.
[122:26.40]I don't know why.
[122:27.10]I don't know why it's called that, but that's like.
[122:28.96]Isn't this all just really disgusting sounding?
[122:31.78]No.
[122:31.98]Who the fuck is this person in the lobby?
[122:47.09]I don't think you could describe any food as chunk light and have it sound appetizing.
[122:53.77]Just protect me for a second.
[122:56.66]Chunk light tuna.
[123:01.96]Chunk light tuna typically consists of skipjack, but also may include yellowfin or big eye tuna.
[123:08.62]It features a softer texture and it tends to be darker in color with smaller pieces and a stronger flavor.
[123:15.53]That's why I don't like it.
[123:17.77]There you go.
[123:18.53]That's what chunk light tuna means.
[123:21.85]And the kind you like is called?
[123:23.49]Solid albacore.
[123:31.18]I'm still like, wouldn't it just be easier to not eat tuna?
[123:37.10]But I like solid white albacore tuna.
[123:40.66]I like the way it tastes.
[123:41.42]I like it.
[123:42.06]It tastes good with pretzels.
[123:43.68]But wouldn't it be easier to not like it?
[123:47.53]I don't know.
[123:47.79]What are some foods that you like that I don't like?
[123:49.30]Yeah, that green ketchup.
[123:52.70]That green and purple ketchup.
[123:54.70]That's like fucking weird.
[123:55.76]You like that.
[123:57.87]Stop implying that I like that.
[123:59.77]No one likes that.
[124:01.15]I do not want that on my permanent record.
[124:05.55]You can't do that to someone.
[124:07.04]I'll never work again.
[124:10.98]Yeah, I mean, it's kind of gross when, you know, it's over at your place and open up the fridge.
[124:18.04]You're like, yeah, grab a snack.
[124:19.00]I'm like, alright.
[124:19.54]And I see you got that purple ketchup in there.
[124:21.54]And I was like, no fucking way does a human have this.
[124:24.84]You go over to someone's house and they're like, oh, we're having burgers for dinner.
[124:28.27]If you want to stay and eat, you're like, oh, absolutely.
[124:29.81]I would love that.
[124:30.45]But they hand you a burger and under your bun is purple ketchup.
[124:35.69]You're just going to politely eat that?
[124:37.47]You're going to not mention it?
[124:39.45]I'll eat it.
[124:42.77]What do you mention it?
[124:45.05]No.
[124:46.83]OK, then you take a bite.
[124:49.01]And it really tastes like.
[124:52.25]It's like it is sick.
[124:53.99]It's sickening to me.
[124:55.45]Yes, you want to like gag and like.
[125:00.40]Oh shit, I went mad.
[125:02.68]Yeah, that can happen to people.
[125:05.22]Too much fringy flame.
[125:06.96]Too much purple ketchup.
[125:17.13]I feel like you're the kind of guy that would eat the hamburger with a straight face and a smile and say, no, I actually really like this.
[125:22.71]No, guys, trust me, I don't hate this.
[125:24.77]No, I actually really actually like this.
[125:28.35]Would I say it that many times?
[125:30.10]Yes.
[125:31.50]I think that was the most accurate thing of what you said.
[125:35.60]Of all of the whole thing you just did, the amount of times I say it is what's actually accurate here.
[125:48.27]Watch out.
[125:50.63]Watch out, we got a bird!
[125:54.73]That actually hurt a lot.
[125:58.79]Just... Burn!
[126:10.65]Ancestral Ster W. Randomly generated.
[126:16.06]I don't like tuna fish.
[126:17.30]Therefore, you're gross.
[126:20.36]Come on.
[126:22.80]What is this?
[126:24.00]What is this bullshit?
[126:26.63]There's a lot of enemies out here.
[126:27.97]We'll be fine.
[126:39.59]How did I not lock on?
[126:49.25]I just mean like if you go to the store to buy food like you still do that right and then yeah like there's tuna and then there's chicken next to it then you willingly chew you're choosing tuna over something
[127:05.17]Is there something wrong with having options to eat?
[127:11.32]Honestly, I believe that one day, like people talk about, you know, the rapture coming and it's soon and that one day, like the government's going to take over and we're all going to have to eat the little pellets that they give us.
[127:22.45]But like, I would love to just eat pellets every day.
[127:28.05]I knew you were going to say that.
[127:30.86]No, like our dog eats the same exact pellets every single day, every day of its life, four years, and it's good for it.
[127:38.63]And that's all it needs.
[127:42.79]Stairs going through his dog food arc.
[127:44.96]I see.
[127:50.67]Are you just never on my side?
[127:51.90]We're just not on my side.
[127:54.22]You know what?
[127:55.20]I will agree with you on a couple of small things here.
[127:57.74]There's a lot of stuff in there.
[127:59.34]Holy shit.
[128:02.20]Oh my God.
[128:03.02]Okay.
[128:03.76]We need to take a look.
[128:04.98]There's bonfire up here and we can do like we have 700 items to loot.
[128:11.37]Okay.
[128:11.65]Your issue here with this is... Hold on.
[128:20.57]Let me level up.
[128:23.16]This is the strategy.
[128:24.60]You hit him with a deranged argument and then you let him look at his items.
[128:29.82]There's no time to rebuttal, so I win.
[128:32.40]Free faith is pretty good.
[128:33.62]I want the fire damage one.
[128:38.58]I have a really good helmet for you.
[128:40.18]Can I see it?
[128:44.69]Oh, I'm getting ready to drop it.
[128:46.58]Okay, so what's going on again?
[128:49.00]Say it again.
[128:50.54]Say it again?
[128:51.02]No, I think I'm good.
[128:52.42]No, no, no.
[128:53.22]I had a rebuttal, and I want to give it to you.
[128:54.66]Say your point again.
[128:56.63]I want to eat pebbles.
[128:57.87]Okay.
[128:59.69]I understand because sometimes, I think everyone's probably like this.
[129:04.05]Sometimes when you're really busy, there's a lot going on.
[129:07.09]There's a lot of things happening.
[129:08.87]It's like eating food can sometimes kind of be a pain in the ass sometimes.
[129:13.05]Always.
[129:13.81]Right?
[129:14.51]Unless you're like, I'm at a restaurant and this is like really good and it was prepared for me.
[129:18.97]It's like a whole environment.
[129:20.43]But day to day, if I had the senzu beans, I'd just be chomping them.
[129:26.07]I think I would use it only for purposes of, hey, I know tomorrow's going to be a really busy day.
[129:30.94]I don't have to worry about food because I'm going to take the weird pellet that's like 700 calories and it's every nutrient I need.
[129:37.17]I'll be alright.
[129:39.49]I wouldn't want to do that for every meal.
[129:40.63]I feel like that you're kind of deleting an entire purpose to be like alive as a human is like to enjoy food, right?
[129:49.73]Like we enjoying consuming food is like a huge deal.
[129:54.23]What is the meaning of life?
[129:56.53]Eat that food.
[129:57.59]I'm serious.
[129:58.23]I'm telling you, it's probably pretty, pretty high up there.
[130:01.98]I think humans getting enjoyment from food is way up there on the list for, you know, our existence.
[130:09.92]And if we weren't eating food, then we might as well just fucking die.
[130:14.36]Is what you're saying.
[130:15.16]No, I'm just saying that, like, like, think about it.
[130:17.66]Food.
[130:18.82]Social.
[130:19.42]Togetherness.
[130:20.98]Conversation.
[130:21.78]Around a table.
[130:23.22]At a restaurant.
[130:24.22]You know what I mean?
[130:24.80]Like, I don't think we're not going to go to a restaurant and we're going to pick the pill off the menu.
[130:28.88]No, fuck that.
[130:29.74]I want to take a bite of my broccolini and go, oh, there's garlic on here.
[130:33.66]Hey, Ster.
[130:33.98]What do you think?
[130:34.50]You want to try?
[130:35.74]By the way, how was that ball game last night?
[130:37.62]Right?
[130:37.80]I don't want to lose that.
[130:40.53]Dude, my Twitter handle is stirlovesfood.
[130:42.73]That's what I'm saying.
[130:44.43]I'm aware.
[130:46.83]But, like, I... I wish there was a pebble.
[130:51.53]I would eat the pebble, but I wouldn't want to eat the pebble for every meal.
[130:54.21]And you are going down a path of, like, we're eating the weird, like, ground-up whatever bugs or something pebbles.
[131:02.11]I don't want to eat that for every meal.
[131:05.65]Ster, who do you think made the first sauce?
[131:07.13]And I mean that.
[131:12.31]What?
[131:14.39]What?
[131:16.74]And you expect me to have a... I don't know.
[131:18.68]Hold on.
[131:20.30]Let's let him work through it.
[131:22.40]Who made the first sauce?
[131:24.89]Hold on, hold on.
[131:27.94]Is there a clue in that sentence?
[131:30.32]No, it's just a question.
[131:32.86]It's just a philosophical question.
[131:35.40]Who made the first sauce?
[131:36.39]Philosophically, who made the first sauce?
[131:38.41]Someone who thought their food was boring.
[131:42.13]But why?
[131:42.73]But what do you mean boring?
[131:44.43]Food was you need to eat food for fuel back in the caveman days.
[131:47.49]What are you talking about?
[131:48.65]Why would you make a sauce?
[131:51.53]Oh, I'm going to make a marinara sauce.
[131:53.09]Why?
[131:53.59]You eat food to survive.
[131:54.35]Because it tastes good.
[131:55.45]It's enjoyable.
[131:56.49]But food is scarce.
[131:58.29]You can't make like... You're not going to make a sauce?
[132:00.79]Who made the first sauce?
[132:02.27]Hey, let me throw a counter argument back at you.
[132:04.08]Okay.
[132:06.38]If all you eat is pebbles, what if you put those pebbles in like milk?
[132:11.48]That would be disgusting.
[132:14.62]Okay.
[132:16.84]What if you had a lifetime supply of these pebbles?
[132:19.66]Alright, we can walk and talk.
[132:22.47]We can walk and talk.
[132:23.91]Okay.
[132:27.31]What if these pebbles were a little bit fruity?
[132:31.81]Or even chocolate?
[132:36.00]Who made the first sauce is all I'm saying.
[132:42.20]You're acting like whoever made the first sauce is Jesus Christ.
[132:46.08]No, no, no, no, no.
[132:46.68]But you will follow him.
[132:47.98]No, but why?
[132:48.62]I will follow him.
[132:54.36]He knew what he was doing, and you cannot doubt it.
[132:57.40]I understand the argument of, and look, this whole argument is fucking stupid.
[133:01.01]I'm aware of that.
[133:01.63]It's just, I was, I was, I was having a fun time.
[133:08.53]I'm I just wish like sometimes I'm sick of eating you agreed and I also want to say that if you like you're like you don't eat very healthy and you're like oh man I like vegetables that's so lame
[133:20.76]You start eating healthier, you get more used to that food, and then you start to be like, dude, I could really go for some asparagus right now.
[133:27.16]You know how, like, you're a child, all you want is chicken nuggets, and then you grow up and you're like, you know, actually, asparagus?
[133:31.63]You know, I could go for some asparagus right now.
[133:34.07]So eventually, the pebbles would grow on you to the point that you're like, dude, I could really hit a bowl of pebbles.
[133:40.51]But these pebbles have flavor to them.
[133:42.63]You didn't say that.
[133:44.15]Do they taste a certain way?
[133:46.70]they don't have to also you're going to want to pick this up you ran past like the golden seed tree of deliciousness yeah the ancestral beast champion armor of the succubus I think I think the issue that I'm having as well as everybody else not just me everyone else in chat is asking the same question yeah
[134:07.14]Okay, so you're eating multiple, a bowl of these.
[134:10.96]So I thought it was like eat one and it was all of your nutrition for the whole day.
[134:14.06]No, like a bowl of pebbles.
[134:15.39]Like you're an adult.
[134:16.17]You have to eat more than one pebble.
[134:18.05]You can't go to Dippin' Dots and get one dot.
[134:20.51]Why would you want this?
[134:22.13]Why do you want to eat a bowl of pebbles?
[134:25.45]It's just like I'm being realistic.
[134:27.47]I don't want to have to.
[134:28.67]If I could eat one senzu bean and be done, I would love that.
[134:31.83]But realistically, I'm going to have to eat a bowl full of pebbles because I'm like a big person.
[134:37.25]Get it on a whiteboard so I can look at it and I'll give you... I have one final argument.
[134:40.89]Okay.
[134:42.80]Eats bowl of pebbles for nutrients.
[134:46.06]Okay.
[134:51.18]I thought that was part of the mod for a second and I was actually scared that something bad was going on.
[134:55.07]I don't... What does that mean?
[134:58.15]That's my final argument.
[134:59.93]I don't... I don't know what that means.
[135:02.45]That's your problem.
[135:05.62]Is that your favorite song or something?
[135:07.02]I don't get it.
[135:11.44]Ashley didn't notice.
[135:13.66]How am I the most zoomer?
[135:15.74]There's no way.
[135:16.36]I don't get it.
[135:21.78]Just forget it.
[135:24.00]He doesn't know.
[135:28.12]Oh, it's the Giga Chad song.
[135:29.96]Yeah, yeah.
[135:32.17]I only know Giga Chat is the face that kind of appears and leans in.
[135:35.82]But the face has a song.
[135:38.08]I did not know that.
[135:42.14]So I win.
[135:44.14]Is what you're saying.
[135:44.82]I don't want to eat pebbles.
[135:46.02]I would like the option to eat one pebble to have full nutrition, but that's it.
[135:52.53]You want another argument, actually?
[135:53.81]Sure.
[135:56.27]What is our Elden Ring character eating?
[136:01.49]Lots of different shit, actually.
[136:03.65]Runes.
[136:04.73]Runes.
[136:05.19]We're not eating those.
[136:05.87]And the runes make us stronger.
[136:07.62]All we need are runes.
[136:08.86]We're not eating those.
[136:09.52]There's nothing else that we need.
[136:10.96]We're not eating them.
[136:12.10]We're, like, absorbing them.
[136:13.96]They're in the air.
[136:14.52]It's like a gas.
[136:15.50]We're not eating them.
[136:15.98]Runes.
[136:16.70]We're eating runes.
[136:17.89]Alright.
[136:18.89]Can we fight this boss?
[136:19.99]Or are you going to keep weirding everybody out?
[136:25.18]Am I?
[136:25.46]I feel like chat's on my side.
[136:29.86]No, they're not.
[136:30.59]No way.
[136:31.79]Okay, let's beat this boss first try.
[136:33.27]Are you going to do a pull?
[136:35.51]Too late.
[136:36.95]I couldn't see what it was.
[136:37.73]I think that actually is Maliketh.
[136:44.04]What?
[136:44.70]Yeah, it's Maliketh, man.
[136:49.20]Wait, why are we getting another mimic here?
[136:51.95]Because that's the way it be.
[136:54.72]But why?
[136:56.90]It's all mimic tier now.
[136:58.16]Oh, I'm not even casting.
[137:14.81]I'm just cheering you on.
[137:18.21]Why is it another mimic tier?
[137:21.72]something wrong no it's not everything's great and one day we'll return together I got a remembrance and I got a great rune I got a lot oh yeah because it's not it's not randomized we actually I keep forgetting
[137:51.18]Wait, play that song again.
[137:54.21]Okay, you ready?
[137:56.89]Go.
[138:08.67]Why do you have that ready?
[138:11.54]For that moment.
[138:16.18]That moment right there.
[138:20.17]You play that when we die to the boss.
[138:22.41]How do you not know anything about comedy?
[138:25.81]Keep it in mind.
[138:26.51]Okay.
[138:28.15]Let's go with... Let's go 25 faith.
[138:31.87]Let's go with... Yeah!
[138:37.77]I also got a remembrance.
[138:42.16]What is it?
[138:43.38]It's the grafted.
[138:48.43]Do we care about this or do I just take this and level up some other stuff?
[138:54.18]Do we care about what?
[138:55.86]The remembrances.
[138:56.76]Do they actually work?
[138:58.34]Or will they be Diablo items?
[139:00.36]It's all... Every item that would normally appear in the game is not randomized and is not a Diablo item.
[139:05.77]The Diablo items are extra.
[139:07.21]Okay.
[139:07.73]So the remembrance would just be the default remembrance stuff.
[139:10.85]Which would be really, really stupid because why would we want a remembrance item?
[139:15.33]Yeah.
[139:15.89]Then they're not ancestral weapons, so they're not the cool ones.
[139:22.24]Now I don't want to ruin this character because I could.
[139:25.14]Oh, I have a Faith Bow.
[139:26.77]A Frost Build-Up Faith Bow.
[139:28.95]Rare, if you're interested in that.
[139:31.93]What should I get Strength and Dex to?
[139:35.43]If I'm going to be almost a pure caster, do I need to even put any points into any of this?
[139:45.82]If my plan eventually... I think that's it, right?
[139:49.94]Yeah.
[139:51.76]Here, check this item out.
[139:58.16]Hold on.
[139:58.42]He's holding.
[139:59.08]I'm holding, holding, holding.
[140:01.52]Item?
[140:02.62]Item?
[140:04.64]Oh, what the heck?
[140:06.86]Alright, it's time to look through all of our items.
[140:08.84]I'll see you in like 30 minutes.
[140:10.42]I'm looking through.
[140:11.58]We got a lot of gunk.
[140:14.04]I'm going to keep this on.
[140:18.28]Thorns.
[140:19.47]Mind.
[140:19.93]Mind.
[140:21.38]Bestial incantations.
[140:26.08]It's got a lot of sickles.
[140:27.36]This thing is actually amazing.
[140:28.51]I'm going to use this for now.
[140:37.89]Free HP.
[140:49.34]I'll keep this free HP on.
[140:59.03]Or FP.
[141:00.21]That's pretty good.
[141:03.64]This one's better.
[141:04.22]Ooh, this one's good, too.
[141:10.18]Yeah.
[141:10.78]This one, two vigor and two HP every three seconds.
[141:16.09]Mmm.
[141:18.27]Mmm, that sounds delicious.
[141:22.35]This is Frenzy Flame, though.
[141:24.41]Mmm.
[141:24.93]Mmm.
[141:27.58]Alright, don't let me forget I have this because I want it eventually.
[141:30.94]OK.
[141:45.62]I think I'm alright for now.
[141:49.62]Actually, let me hold.
[141:50.40]I'm going to look up the Diablo loot mod and figure out what is actually the higher tier.
[142:03.04]It goes common, uncommon, rare, treasured, ancestral, legendary, mythical, god slaying.
[142:11.21]That's a lot of tiers.
[142:14.21]That's a lot of tiers.
[142:19.21]Yeah.
[142:20.39]Frost damage.
[142:25.33]Okay, so the Frenzied Flame seal is how much base just for existing.
[142:33.17]How much damage?
[142:33.71]Does anybody know?
[142:37.02]Because this is 10% Frenzied Flame.
[142:40.58]But this doesn't matter.
[142:42.16]7.
[142:46.82]That's 20%, bro.
[142:48.44]That's Giant's Flame incantations.
[142:56.29]This is B faith scaling right now.
[142:57.87]This is C. But, I don't think that, whatever.
[143:03.63]Incantation scaling.
[143:05.55]So this is 152.
[143:06.47]This one's like better.
[143:10.39]For now, I guess.
[143:28.85]Alright, what about my weapons still better?
[143:31.28]Probably.
[143:36.94]Mind.
[143:39.86]I need.
[143:40.42]Some more strength to put this on.
[143:46.05]If I want to put on that lightning spear thing.
[143:48.23]OK, do you have any like plus strength talismans?
[143:53.97]I just got another slot, I think.
[143:55.29]I think so.
[144:02.03]faith one there's a lot of numbers on the screen right now uh 3 HP every 5.8 seconds is this better kind of I guess alright let's just go I think I know what I'm doing
[144:37.84]Did you go in here?
[144:41.02]Did you even sit on the throne?
[144:45.46]I started running through.
[144:47.69]You didn't even do the funny sit on the throne thing with me in the room.
[144:51.25]Oh, well, you were like looking at your items.
[144:55.17]Fuck, dude.
[145:18.05]okay I got on everything I think is worth having on oh um so I do have a big question though what is going on with the that was two mimic tears in a row why did that happen
[145:46.88]don't know I think because we loosened up the the overall pool of potential things they can be drawing from because we like widened the important areas thing you know what I mean I don't know oh there are two in the base game okay are there actually because I was trying to think like I don't there shouldn't be two mimic tears bless you you are a true my name presuming you're only
[146:15.73]Tops has the regular stuff.
[146:18.29]I don't need it.
[146:18.81]I don't want it.
[146:22.76]Oh, it's one in a dungeon.
[146:24.00]In one of the little mini dungeons.
[146:25.04]Okay, that makes sense.
[146:39.77]Sounds good to me.
[146:42.23]Hot thrown items.
[146:43.37]Damage increased.
[146:51.18]Item.
[146:53.00]Alright.
[146:53.20]So where to now?
[146:54.20]That was cool.
[146:55.42]Want to just go on the left and do the jail?
[146:59.20]You love Evergales.
[147:01.06]It's just a boss right there.
[147:03.50]Okay.
[147:04.42]Right.
[147:04.62]I mean, it's just a boss.
[147:06.10]It's just a boss.
[147:06.92]Like, it's just a boss, bro.
[147:10.00]Let's just get some runes.
[147:13.32]Academy scroll.
[147:16.94]Where did you go?
[147:17.48]Oh, you went down.
[147:18.24]I see.
[147:21.33]How did you... You really went all over here.
[147:25.39]Whatever.
[147:25.69]There we go.
[147:43.58]Coming.
[147:45.14]I've killed this whole camp already.
[147:48.00]I was looking at stuff.
[148:06.12]somewhere I thought there was a chest in here is that that's not that's you okay I'm like what the hell I'm just I'm making it so it's easy to see everything okay alright let's do the average jail let's go to summer jail yeah it's like not actually that close you got to go like all the way around oh that's I think you're right but there should be uh
[148:29.90]It's not that.
[148:30.72]You know what?
[148:31.26]You're going to give up when I say something's a little hard.
[148:33.50]Let's stick to our guns here.
[148:35.94]What are you guys doing over here?
[148:37.12]What's wrong with you guys?
[148:38.70]I got a sacred tear.
[148:45.17]Hold on.
[148:46.61]Oh, yeah.
[148:46.95]Me too.
[148:53.33]Definitely use it.
[149:01.28]What's your coolest item?
[149:04.30]Probably the axe that I have right now.
[149:06.38]Oh no, probably the catch flame.
[149:07.68]It's the only thing doing damage.
[149:12.80]OK.
[149:14.43]OK.
[149:21.77]It is right here.
[149:24.47]But you had to go down further for that jump.
[149:30.66]Alright, something very hard.
[149:33.74]Nothing can stop me.
[149:34.70]Once I start swinging, I've already won the fight.
[149:36.98]I hope it's a dragon.
[149:39.90]Bulls, the thief of fire.
[149:46.67]Ow.
[150:02.65]Nice.
[150:02.93]Oh, my God.
[150:07.27]Oh, my God.
[150:08.59]Flame of the Fel God.
[150:21.04]Yes.
[150:21.44]Hey, there you go.
[150:22.46]That thing's probably pretty good.
[150:34.93]That's not a frenzy spell?
[150:36.63]Better than what I have.
[150:37.27]It's trash.
[150:40.85]Trash.
[150:41.69]Hey!
[150:42.11]I don't open up your fridge and say, look at all this trash in here.
[150:48.80]This is my food.
[150:50.46]I would do that if there were tuna in it.
[150:55.25]What's your favorite food?
[150:56.99]My favorite food?
[150:58.33]Like, oh my goodness, I love it so much.
[151:01.40]It's my favorite single fucking food item.
[151:03.38]What is it?
[151:03.80]Without question, my favorite food is flavorless nutrient pebble.
[151:08.04]No, no, no, no.
[151:12.63]Nobody thinks that's funny besides you.
[151:15.11]Okay, so answer the question.
[151:20.61]What's your favorite single food item?
[151:22.49]Okay.
[151:22.87]Alright.
[151:23.17]Sorry.
[151:23.45]My favorite food is flavorless nutrient pebble.
[151:31.79]Cool.
[151:32.71]That's the answer I was looking for.
[151:41.56]If you were to pick something else besides flavorless nutrient paste.
[151:45.40]Back it up.
[151:47.04]You do come over.
[151:48.75]And you open the fridge and it is like 20 tubs without labels all filled with the same white paste.
[151:56.13]But what's in it though?
[151:59.07]There's no labels on it.
[152:00.28]Is it tuna fish?
[152:01.94]No, it is like... Oh, dude.
[152:04.96]It's tuna.
[152:06.74]It's not tuna.
[152:07.68]There's no... It's not tuna.
[152:12.30]This is not the right one.
[152:18.28]I got the wrong song.
[152:19.76]Well, I can't hear it.
[152:21.62]Okay, never mind.
[152:23.74]I don't really know what's going on right now.
[152:25.30]I typed in Giga Chad song, and that was the first one I clicked on.
[152:39.13]I actually, I need you to answer this and I'm going to ask it until you, I'm going to ask it until I get an answer.
[152:44.68]Because you want to make fun of my favorite food?
[152:47.08]No, no.
[152:48.18]I'm sure it's delicious.
[152:49.23]Just what is it?
[152:53.09]I, I, honest to goodness.
[152:55.84]Let's play.
[152:56.46]I was just on a rant about how I'm sick of eating and I wish I could have flavorless pebbles.
[153:01.46]That means you don't have a food you like to eat?
[153:04.82]I like a lot of foods, but I really am at the point where I'm transcending the human form and just want to be a ball of energy.
[153:13.84]Can somebody else answer this question?
[153:15.70]I just want to bring up a point.
[153:17.64]Hey, VRJosh, what's your favorite food?
[153:20.71]My favorite food is tuna.
[153:29.32]He just wrote, huh?
[153:33.96]I think that's an item for you.
[153:35.22]That's like a fire item.
[153:36.50]That is a fire item.
[153:37.61]Nice.
[153:42.11]Okay.
[153:42.51]Well, you obviously, I had a thing that was going to be really cool and you blew it.
[153:49.38]You like burgers, though.
[153:50.48]Aren't you like the burger guy?
[153:52.14]You like burgers a lot?
[153:54.78]I've been typecast.
[153:56.96]You have like five emotes that are burgers, don't you?
[153:59.97]I have a lot of emotes that are burgers, but I've been typecast.
[154:02.49]I ate a burger one time in the Wall Street Journal.
[154:06.07]Will not leave me alone about it.
[154:08.07]I think it's all that I eat.
[154:11.65]Okay, alright.
[154:12.69]Okay, chili verde burritos are pretty good.
[154:16.33]I had one earlier.
[154:16.98]Alright, thanks, Josh.
[154:18.36]So, Josh, I have a question for you.
[154:20.50]If you opened up the fridge, and there was a chili verde burrito made by a professional chef, and it's like, it's arguably the best quality you've ever seen in your entire life.
[154:32.56]But it is surrounded on all sides by tuna fish sandwiches in the fridge.
[154:39.39]Will you, is it, are you so, is it so disgusting to you?
[154:42.95]Will you reach in and will you grab that burrito?
[154:46.23]Mom, my food touched the ketchup and I don't like the ketchup and my mashed potatoes touched my pee.
[154:52.21]No, no, they're all on the same plate and they're all wrapped under the same saran wrap.
[155:00.60]Like, they're all on the same plate, wrapped under the same saran wrap.
[155:04.98]Gross, throw it away.
[155:09.69]They're all under the... Yeah, I'd throw it away.
[155:12.05]That's disgusting.
[155:13.03]Whatever is under the saran wrap in a plate of tuna and you have a burger in the middle is going to taste like tuna.
[155:19.59]I was curious if being in the same place was disgusting to you.
[155:25.06]Well, they're going to taste the same.
[155:26.20]No, they're not.
[155:28.64]I mean, you can like burgers and you can like tuna, but would you like a burger that had the scent and fragrance of it's been sitting in a saran wrap tuna thing?
[155:42.44]I'm just trying to get you to say you would like eat.
[155:46.77]I don't know.
[155:47.19]I'm just trying to get you to talk to me.
[155:49.83]I'm talking to you, but I just feel like I'm not saying what you want me to say.
[155:53.11]It means you didn't wrap it good enough.
[156:03.12]I got some cool stuff and I want to look at it.
[156:07.31]Let's get up to this bonfire up here.
[156:08.95]We can also do this area.
[156:10.53]Maybe get some larval tears up here.
[156:13.91]Watch out.
[156:14.27]There's a large doggy and not the good kind.
[156:16.76]I think it's a lot of health.
[156:30.61]Ow!
[156:32.19]Yo, you fell off.
[156:33.45]I fell.
[156:33.77]I'm fine.
[156:37.52]Jerma, why is your only talking point food?
[156:40.80]Why am I getting blamed for this?
[156:42.04]You're the one that brought up the nutrient pellets.
[156:46.83]It's a pretty common talking point for you.
[156:49.95]Haven't you done, like, tier lists of, like, every kind of food in existence?
[156:55.62]I mean, I've done some of that stuff.
[157:11.62]you've done like the cereal tier list and the fast food tier list haven't you I I've done tier lists on things I like yes you have yes uh would you be would you do the waifu tier list
[157:28.24]waifu war to figure out who your waifu is waifu war yeah it's it's one of those things where you choose there it gives you two images and you gotta pick one and it goes all the way down to the end round of 256 to figure out who your waifu is I've just spent 200 rounds on this your ambitions um yeah that's the only way to know for sure oh what did you get
[157:58.09]I ended up having to pick the Helltaker main character as Satan.
[158:02.49]Alright, can I just say Ursula and we can move on?
[158:06.87]Ursula?
[158:07.57]Ursula wasn't on my list.
[158:12.66]It's a good pick.
[158:15.80]I can't hit on Ursula unless she is inside a saran wrap of tuna.
[158:21.00]Fake laugh, by the way.
[158:23.20]Shut up.
[158:23.44]Wait, has he been faking it this whole time?
[158:27.22]I'm going to push you.
[158:28.30]Alright.
[158:48.53]Make sure you get your seal.
[159:28.29]I'm fucking speechless.
[159:31.77]Why?
[159:32.11]It's my favorite NPC in the game.
[159:35.21]Jerma, if I ever came to visit you, and you were that old, your legs didn't work, you're hiding in a bush pretending to be a pot, I'd do the same to you.
[159:47.08]No!
[159:48.06]No!
[159:49.06]I fell.
[159:51.38]I fake laughed again.
[159:52.78]Whatever, I don't care.
[160:00.15]coming wait am I jumping off too I mean what else is up there besides I mean we could do the little boss up there maybe I mean there is a little boss up there there is a little boss but I'd have to go all the way around wouldn't okay yeah no it's too late now yeah we got bigger fish to fry doing it is pretty good on the stove watch out dragon I would say I pretty much recommend that
[160:29.88]Oh, there he goes talking about food again.
[160:38.90]You just killed that in one hit.
[160:41.09]Yeah.
[160:43.61]Alright, so where's our destination?
[160:46.19]Would you like to know?
[160:51.77]Anything in particular you want to do?
[160:53.95]I'm feeling very strong.
[160:55.85]I feel like we're following the same path we did the first time though.
[165:59.34]Yeah.
[161:00.34]Like this would just take us back to the Glintstone academy and we do Glintstone academy.
[161:05.34]Like- like what's like a different way that we didn't go last time.
[161:08.34]We didn't really do anything underground last time really. We didn't do like Nokron. We didn't do the blood place.
[161:14.00]We also just kind of ran through Caelid. I feel like we could handle Caelid.
[161:18.00]We could probably handle Caelid.
[161:19.00]As early as things are I feel like- you know what we- let's like go back, get a bonfire, take the road up to Caelid.
[161:24.00]There's a church along the way. I think there's a- a reforged boss.
[161:31.00]Really?
[161:32.00]That's like not usually there but it might be randomized.
[161:34.00]You scared the shit out of me.
[161:44.00]Cookbook. Okay.
[161:57.79]I was expecting more goofy mods.
[162:00.88]I don't think they really exist for Elden Ring.
[162:03.42]There aren't a lot.
[162:05.08]First of all, there aren't a lot.
[162:06.54]I was looking into some goofy mods.
[162:09.38]And then they're hard to merge together.
[162:13.50]Yeah.
[162:14.44]It's like the effort versus goofy reward.
[162:16.59]And then it's like one armor piece in the game.
[162:18.75]It's like that one's like Batman's armor.
[162:20.71]Then we're randomized and we'll never find it and never even know it was there.
[162:24.45]I mean, that would be kind of funny to be in, like, a Batman costume.
[162:28.05]I thought it would be funny, you know, you go to the round table hold and, like, the main guy there is Batman.
[162:33.29]Like, that'd be funny.
[162:34.03]Yeah.
[162:35.13]Somebody said Donald Duck.
[162:36.34]That'd be kind of funny.
[162:42.74]Um... Let's find closest bonfire.
[162:53.60]Oh, that's actually amazing.
[162:58.47]That's one of the things that gets buffed.
[163:01.09]If... Well, we can't really do it, but... I think that's one of the schools of magic that's buffed with Warlock if you play the actual Reforged.
[163:23.81]For real dragon at the dragon spot.
[163:26.79]Unless that's a distant.
[163:30.31]I remember it being fake.
[163:33.01]Is this one fake?
[163:35.27]Seems like it's going to die.
[163:36.79]A lot of health.
[164:02.25]I'm doing a sneeze build right now.
[164:05.53]Yeah, sneeze on this guy.
[164:06.71]I'm too short.
[164:26.67]I'm too short.
[164:37.39]Oh that.
[164:40.87]I'm alive.
[164:41.71]You are alive.
[164:43.73]That one point of vigor.
[164:50.23]It's making really cool looking stuff on the ground though.
[165:09.09]Watch out, Super Bomb!
[165:19.23]Watch out, Super Bomb!
[165:22.67]And here comes his next attack, Super Bomb!
[165:28.42]Oh no, look out, he's gonna do Super Bomb!
[165:37.16]Super Bomb.
[165:38.89]Hit him in his eyes dragons can't see without eyes Stop doing that Super bomb Watch out
[166:09.57]I have not attacked him in like five minutes.
[166:12.17]I was going to say, I don't think you have.
[166:23.24]Oh, shit.
[166:23.72]Super bomb.
[166:31.73]That's going to kill me.
[166:34.37]I'm dead.
[166:34.83]Oh, no.
[166:35.23]You are dead.
[166:39.30]I feel like I was losing my dignity of running around and avoiding the super bomb.
[166:44.48]Oh, that hurts my eyes.

[170:28.34]I might have two of them.

[171:04.14]Hold on.
[171:04.52]I'm getting stuck up here.
[171:18.23]Alright, I'm going to sit at this bonfire so I don't lose this again.
[171:20.49]I am going.
[171:32.73]Are we aggroing this thing again?
[171:33.87]Is that what's happening?
[171:36.31]I don't want to fight it.
[171:38.19]We had it.
[171:39.43]It has multi-screen AOE.
[171:41.61]You insta-dead if you're in it.
[171:44.03]It's boring.
[171:48.81]I'm not bad.
[171:49.61]It's boring.
[171:50.17]You've got to believe me.
[171:54.46]You did get hit by a super bomb though.
[171:57.08]I did.
[171:58.49]Well, let's get hit by the super bomb or run away on the horse for like 10 minutes.
[172:02.84]Yeah.
[172:02.94]Yeah, that's true.
[172:07.06]I don't know what hit me.
[172:07.74]Alright.
[172:08.06]Where's this?
[172:08.40]Oh, it's right here.
[172:09.42]Hold on.
[172:09.70]Let me just touch this first.
[172:13.64]Here.
[172:13.80]I think you're going to warp to this bonfire, though.
[172:16.53]I got to fight it again.
[172:17.33]Let me just sit down.
[172:21.11]I'm telling you to warp to me.
[172:22.89]No!
[172:23.07]No!
[172:26.56]Aren't you right next to me?
[172:27.67]You're like right here.
[172:28.71]Okay, I will warp to you.
[172:32.47]The axe was doing more damage.
[172:34.11]It was only like 40, wasn't it?
[172:43.02]Okay, I'm like stuck on the map.
[172:44.86]I could absolutely just run to you.
[172:59.89]Yeah, because I need to two-hand it.
[173:01.37]So it's going to do less.
[173:05.20]Two-hand it before you get on the horse.
[173:07.76]Does that actually work?
[173:12.00]Hello.
[173:14.74]Do you have a stone sword key?
[173:15.92]It doesn't work.
[173:17.94]I do.
[173:19.06]You need two for this.
[173:20.00]I've got one and you've got one.
[173:21.28]I don't have one.
[173:25.66]You must have one.
[173:26.43]I'm going to drop mine.
[173:28.39]You can't drop them.
[173:29.29]Yeah, you can.
[173:29.93]I left.
[173:30.93]Didn't I pick one out?
[173:31.67]Yeah, I got one.
[173:33.35]Stone sword key.
[173:35.17]Yeah, this needs two.
[173:36.03]I can't drop them.
[173:36.73]Oh, you can't.
[173:37.31]Okay, so you have to have two.
[173:39.20]You can't just put one in and I put one in.
[173:43.87]Dang it.
[173:44.45]I really wanted to do that dungeon with my friend.
[173:46.68]You ready to kill the dragon?
[173:51.16]Are we?
[173:51.82]Yeah.
[173:52.94]Okay.
[173:53.84]We can't give up.
[173:55.22]Does he only start doing the screams in like phase two or something?
[173:58.48]Because he wasn't initially.
[174:00.22]Just play it.
[174:01.39]Save.
[174:11.87]Look, already like 10%.
[174:15.73]OK, he leans up like that and he does the big super bomb.
[174:19.02]He's not doing anything.
[174:19.88]What do you mean he didn't do anything?
[174:21.32]He like puts his head up like that.
[174:30.42]We don't have a health bar anymore though.
[174:33.28]I do.
[174:33.74]I was getting that bug a lot in our last run.
[174:35.80]And then you get to him and then he flies away.
[174:56.66]Yeah, he's probably going to do it.
[175:00.16]He's not.
[175:01.04]He's swinging down.
[175:01.96]Yeah, I think it's a phase two thing.
[175:05.57]Alright, he's doing something weird.
[175:06.93]Going after you.
[175:07.45]He's going to bait it out.
[175:21.78]Mm-hmm.
[175:23.86]Okay.
[175:28.82]There he goes.
[175:29.75]Back here.
[175:30.11]Okay.
[175:38.31]Aggroing.
[175:48.22]Nice avoidance.
[175:56.78]Super bomb, super bomb, super bomb.
[175:58.22]Nice.
[176:18.93]If this dragon open his mouth, I dead though.
[176:29.82]Uh-huh.
[176:30.42]It's fine, come over to me.
[176:52.80]Super bomb.
[176:56.76]I started running I was stuck under his wing and I died oh he died oh you got this buddy
[177:33.54]Superbomb.
[177:37.86]Who is he talking to?
[177:41.06]Superbomb.
[177:43.48]Superbomb coming in.
[177:46.13]Superbomb.
[177:46.91]It hit you.
[177:47.27]It hit you, dude.
[177:49.53]Sneeze on him.
[177:50.03]Sneeze.
[177:50.45]Sneeze.
[177:50.97]Run, run, run.
[177:51.53]Superbomb.
[177:52.03]I'm already out.
[177:54.69]I'm commentating.
[177:58.43]Going back in with a couple more sneezes.
[178:00.67]Looking good.
[178:01.13]Looking good.
[178:01.63]Frost.
[178:03.55]You melt in that frost a little bit.
[178:07.67]Watch out for any additional attacks coming in here.
[178:10.08]Ooh, watch out.
[178:16.86]See the hitbox on this thing.
[178:17.99]We're good.
[178:21.77]Don't lose it here.
[178:33.21]Are you dead?
[178:34.77]Are you dead again?
[178:35.73]I was just standing there watching it.
[178:39.11]Fight him!
[178:39.63]What do you mean standing here watching?
[178:41.79]You don't want to do this again?
[178:43.03]I didn't want to rejoin and discredit your win that you can totally get by yourself.
[178:48.79]No, the win is us.
[178:49.97]It's us winning.
[178:50.89]It's not me or you.
[178:52.01]It's not winning if I die and just keep zerging it.
[178:55.53]You got this.
[178:56.71]You're not going to even attack it?
[178:58.89]Come on, get it!
[179:03.00]Alright, alright, alright!
[179:07.66]You got him!
[179:12.28]Can you play the Giga Chat music again for me?
[179:15.89]Okay, get in there.
[179:17.55]Get in there, get in there!
[179:18.73]Going him.
[179:30.30]But it flew away again.
[179:42.37]I think your CD is scratched.
[179:44.28]If I die from this, I'm going to be so mad.
[180:09.42]Everything's fine.
[180:11.64]Re-aggroing.
[180:19.22]You got this!
[180:20.04]Come on!
[180:32.15]A Giga Chat would have hit him again.
[180:33.29]A Giga Chat would stay alive.
[180:45.78]Got him.
[180:46.26]I actually got the last hit you did.
[180:47.42]I got him.
[180:47.76]I got last hit.
[180:48.48]I got all the experience.
[180:51.36]My sword leveled up.
[180:52.80]How come you didn't play it that time?
[180:59.17]Oh.
[181:04.01]I missed the moment.
[181:05.59]Alright.
[181:05.87]We got money.
[181:07.18]I got a dragon heart.
[181:09.12]We can pick up the thing.
[181:11.20]Right?
[181:11.52]Isn't it right here?
[181:12.88]Yeah.
[181:14.38]Oh, yeah.
[181:22.84]Lots of stuff.
[181:25.76]Okay, so now your question is, we should probably... We have the key.
[181:29.41]We don't need to come back down here.
[181:33.79]Yeah.
[181:35.25]So we... You want to try to do Caelid, you said.
[181:37.79]You'd like to go through Caelid?
[181:39.88]We could do that.
[181:42.22]Yeah, up that road, just straight up into Caelid.
[181:45.60]Saints Bridge, follow the road.
[181:49.59]I feel you.
[181:51.70]Although can I let me put another spell on I got a new one.

[182:15.94]Love that for you.
[182:24.62]Alright, I want a new spell.
[182:27.18]This thing's dumb.
[182:28.75]This thing is cool.
[182:29.99]Enchants right hand armament with blood flame.
[182:34.09]Or... What?
[182:37.25]Wish I could enchant my right hand with blood flame.
[182:45.23]Let's try it.
[182:45.51]Is that what I'm going to say now?
[182:50.88]Because that looks pretty cool.
[182:55.82]You look cool, man.
[182:56.94]Alright, let's do it.
[183:00.42]To Caelid we go.
[183:01.18]It's going to be stuck in your head now.
[183:21.68]You don't even know that all night.
[183:23.02]It's catchy.
[183:24.14]It's real catchy.
[183:30.12]this uh oh this is a boat guy let's get bokeh little bonfire down here at boat guy
[183:50.78]Millenia keeps talking to me over and over again.
[183:54.00]It keeps saying the same thing.
[183:55.52]That's part of Reforged.
[183:57.67]For some reason, there's an option for her to always appear at the bonfire.
[184:01.25]Oh.
[184:05.23]In case you like her.
[184:06.19]Tibia O'Neil.
[184:07.75]That's a good name.
[184:14.57]Frenzied Club.
[184:16.89]I can't stop.
[184:18.01]Once it starts, I can't stop.
[184:19.49]There's a lot of... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[184:20.93]No, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[184:22.01]Actually, stop.
[184:23.41]This scarlet rot here.
[184:24.41]That's why I was trying to tell you.
[184:27.61]Okay, well, I'm scarlet rotted, so... I'm gonna die.
[184:33.17]Dude, I swear the hitbox is still weird with the dodging.
[184:36.91]Okay.
[184:47.82]I'm killing these archers.
[184:49.88]I put on the Frenzied Flame of ambition.
[185:00.92]What the?
[185:02.75]They all spawned over there.
[185:03.69]They spawned on top of me.
[185:05.91]I have no health.
[185:06.89]I'm dead too.
[185:10.41]I should not have died to that.
[185:11.95]But then they spawned on me.
[185:21.58]Okay, so he fills the whole area with scarlet rot.
[185:25.13]It's actually not that bad because we have all the items that give like HP regeneration are countering a bit of the scarlet rot.
[185:41.49]Okay.
[185:42.69]Ready?
[185:43.74]Do we need to sit down or no?
[185:46.02]I don't think so.
[185:52.14]Staying on the horse.
[185:52.74]I'm going to not go fight.
[185:54.90]Wait, my head feels... Wait, am I real?
[185:59.66]What's going on?
[186:01.06]Nothing.
[186:01.68]I'm good.
[186:02.56]I just had a moment.
[186:13.05]Yeah, I should have just kept hitting him.
[186:14.71]You're wrong.
[186:24.60]Okay.
[186:41.67]Okay.
[186:45.18]When you hit him, he takes damage.
[186:46.46]And when he gets to zero, he dies.
[186:48.44]Only 2,400.
[186:48.78]What is... What?
[186:49.36]That's it?
[186:49.84]Who the hell is this?
[187:01.25]Who actually is this?
[187:02.23]It's D. Is this D's brother D?
[187:08.78]I've never seen him here.
[187:09.62]I'm either.
[187:10.26]I want that.
[187:11.44]That sword looks awesome.
[187:13.84]I've never seen that weapon.
[187:31.38]I've ever played Tibia.
[187:32.42]No, I have not.
[187:37.15]That's not a game.
[187:37.81]I think it's an old game.
[187:44.09]There's an ulcer spirit over here.
[187:48.15]Want to mess around?
[187:49.19]Yeah, I want to.
[187:50.10]I want to fuck around and find out.
[187:55.44]Scary.
[187:56.56]It's not just that.
[187:57.36]That's their kind of scary thing.
[188:17.93]did we do it something else here okay good deer bird stop okay that was cool well shouldn't there also be uh
[188:39.85]Way to go down a room.
[188:41.73]I think you are correct.
[188:43.71]I think you're right.
[188:44.15]I remember this one might have been one of the weird ones where there's like all the way to go on deck down like a weird hidden floor.
[188:58.52]Yeah, is it that way?
[188:59.44]Is it this one?
[189:02.74]That's what I'm asking.
[189:04.06]I don't know.
[189:04.58]We don't need to find out Ster.
[189:06.58]Dear.
[189:14.98]You can have fun with that dog.
[189:16.48]You need help?
[189:18.42]You know what?
[189:18.82]I'm on it.
[189:19.62]I'm here.
[189:20.43]Already did it.
[189:20.79]I'm here.
[189:22.97]Already got it.
[189:23.45]Nice.
[189:26.11]Okay.
[189:27.51]Let's find a way down.
[189:35.27]Let's go.
[189:37.75]I think it's higher up on the hill.
[189:40.35]Hey, dude, have you ever slipped a disk?
[189:42.71]Yeah, it's right here.
[189:45.31]There was a while where I thought that the chest pain, I thought that was a disk problem, but it turns out it probably isn't.
[189:53.72]Oh, yeah, there you go.
[189:56.64]There you go.
[189:58.04]Never did, but he thought he did.
[189:59.70]Interesting room.
[190:00.20]Okay.
[190:08.06]Not this one.
[190:09.48]Not this one.
[190:13.90]They had it coming.
[190:17.98]Ooh, isn't that kind of good?
[190:21.92]Uh, turtle talisman?
[190:24.49]I guess maybe not when it comes to the random shit you can get in the Diablo II mod.
[190:29.35]I'm sure that's something we have on us way better.
[190:37.79]Potentially.
[190:40.37]Potentially.
[190:40.95]Alright.
[190:44.47]We could go to the Erdtree.
[190:48.61]The one that's encaled over here.
[190:49.99]We should go to the church, the smoldering church.
[190:52.67]Go to the Erdtree.
[190:56.01]And then go to the Kalem ruins.
[191:00.52]I think that's the plan.
[191:01.20]What do you think?
[191:02.36]He called it Kalem.
[191:05.14]Yeah, no.
[191:05.70]Okay.
[191:05.98]I'm with you.
[191:09.22]You watch it, mister.
[191:10.92]You watch it, Buster.
[191:14.06]Hey, listen.
[191:16.42]Listen, Buster.
[191:17.20]I'm going to be putting up with this much longer, Buster.
[191:22.94]You understand, Jack?
[191:24.50]I'm not your Buster, pal.
[191:32.94]It's gone on far enough.
[191:34.27]It's gone on long enough, Buster.
[191:49.34]Anything here that we can get?
[191:58.82]Oh no, it's Perceptor Miriam!
[192:01.48]No, no, she's gone mad!
[192:06.71]He got this.
[192:10.71]Well, you know what?
[192:13.03]That actually worked.
[192:15.11]Actually worked.
[192:15.67]It freaked me out.
[192:16.25]I was like, what's going on?
[192:23.39]I was waiting to dodge the projectiles and they just kept reappearing.
[192:37.08]Now you listen here, Buster.
[192:38.48]That joke was funny the first five times you made it.
[192:41.00]I don't think it's funny anymore.
[192:42.24]You understand, Jack?
[192:44.60]That's funny from my perspective.
[192:46.87]You didn't see what happened.
[192:51.94]I can't level up anymore.
[192:52.82]I think she's gone.
[192:55.08]Uh oh.
[193:04.30]I can't.
[193:05.02]I'm stuck.
[193:07.14]I tried to level up.
[193:08.16]I tried to level up and Malenia kind of just sat down for a second and then left.

[202:02.03]I need 40 faith to use it, but it scales off of arcane.
[202:04.79]It does not scale off of faith.
[202:06.35]That kind of sucks.
[202:08.99]Oh, that's sad.
[202:15.91]Well.
[202:17.39]Cool weapon.
[202:23.56]Why are you going faith?
[202:24.38]Because I want to do the frenzied fingers spells.
[202:29.18]Like we'll even get that far.
[202:33.76]wait wait wait wait wait wait wait a minute here I'm calling an audible you're calling an audible yeah where's that frenzy tower like if you go along the right side of lake of leonia there's the frenzied tower we can actually get you some frenzy wait a minute you're right is it that it's the highway lookout tower right it's one of them
[202:59.16]I know that following that long right route is where you get like Vikespear and some other Frenzy stuff.
[203:04.69]Where is it?
[203:05.51]Right here.
[203:05.77]Wait a gosh darn minute.
[203:07.79]Yeah, it's this one.
[203:08.31]Frenzy Flaming Tower.
[203:10.53]So we go up this way and we've got Rapper on the right side.
[203:13.92]Yeah.
[203:14.94]Let's get some Frenzy Flames.
[203:53.48]It's Sunday.
[203:54.46]Sparkle on.
[203:55.14]It's actually supposed to be Wednesday for that.
[203:58.73]But any day of the week.
[204:00.33]Any day of the week works.
[204:03.11]Okay.
[204:03.39]So I was right.
[204:06.47]You corrected me.
[204:07.52]Then you mansplained.
[204:08.58]And then you said I was actually right.
[204:10.48]Well, the original is Wednesday.
[204:12.58]Okay.
[204:28.67]What is actually here?
[204:29.47]It's like the weird eyeball one where you go like you out of your eye, right?
[204:34.42]But I think that's the one that's up here.
[204:37.10]The frenzy spell.
[204:40.14]I think they're all along that right route.
[204:42.86]There's the one tower.
[204:44.78]That gives you the grab one.
[204:51.08]Looking at the map, this is the wrong way.
[204:54.45]We're on the wrong way, dude.
[205:03.20]Yeah.
[205:03.44]Yeah, we have to actually go up this little thing up here.
[205:25.95]The first Sombra Smithing Stone I think I found.
[205:35.03]dong yeah we do have the academy key as well dong hey also right around here is the uh the Smithing Stone mine I'd be down for that we could go we could go fill up on stones yeah I want to stone up we haven't done a stone up run ever
[205:58.44]I want to get stoned in here.
[205:59.40]Let's go.
[206:00.10]Is there a bonfire?
[206:00.66]There's a bonfire down here, isn't there?
[206:02.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[206:02.88]Because I think I have that thing on.
[206:04.74]It's real chill, man.
[206:06.50]I do.
[206:10.54]Yeah.
[206:19.50]Okay.
[206:25.84]That's better.
[206:35.01]I feel like I'm never going to find something better than this club.
[206:41.35]I kind of feel you on that, but I think this thing that I'm using is really not that great, so I still have room to go.
[206:59.50]crystals that's crack add a lot of health now let's just like zoom zoom like in out grab the duffy keep going
[207:29.47]Got him.
[207:30.77]Got him.
[207:31.25]Watch out.
[207:31.87]Bear.
[207:42.20]When they group up like that, the fire does a lot.
[207:54.11]Ow.
[207:57.40]Common sacred celebrants rib rake.
[208:01.29]Okay.
[208:16.94]Strength, lightning.
[208:18.42]This scales with faith, but is this better than what I have right now?
[208:23.75]I don't know.
[208:24.15]I'm going to have to sit down and look at all this.
[208:26.79]Not right now.
[208:28.01]Later.
[208:28.25]Okay.
[208:42.57]Look at all these.
[208:43.33]There's so many of these talismans and they all kind of say the same words.
[208:49.08]Yeah.
[208:50.36]They need to sell them all.
[208:51.38]They're probably worth a lot.
[208:52.36]Yeah.
[209:12.96]Aren't cheese on the wall?
[209:22.86]It's made about a waste to come down here.
[209:24.04]I didn't realize it was like I love this area is higher level than Smithing Stone two and three.
[209:30.25]Still not bad to have.
[209:31.61]I guess I want to fight the boss.
[209:38.07]Wrong button.
[209:39.27]That's alright.
[209:47.60]Uncommon sacred battle hammer of the glint blade.
[209:52.60]I saw, I heard sacred.
[209:54.72]Ooh, 30 strength.
[209:56.28]Come on.
[209:59.22]strengthens glint blade sorceries by fit what a wacky item it's just like I don't even need to I just that's just wacky
[210:20.39]So that's a faith weapon that boosts sorceries and is a big heavy blunt weapon.
[210:25.69]Interesting.
[210:27.13]Common sacred iron cleaver.
[210:30.39]Same deal.
[210:32.67]This one though is B scaling.
[210:39.27]I think it's not super worth looking at anything that is a common rarity.
[210:44.93]really because I think this is like better than what I have common rarity for a weapon does 0.9 damage a mythical weapon does 2.4 times damage oh so they just exponentially scale I see unless the mods are on on a common or like insane I guess and care like you know
[211:20.66]we need that good loot for the guild oh my god did you just give me rot wow that's a lot good yeah this is all going in guild stash
[211:51.52]Don't be able to upgrade every single weapon to plus three or four at least.
[211:56.72]Plus 5 plus 10.
[211:57.50]The drama.
[212:02.32]The Diablo weapons go to +2.
[212:06.31]All of them like every song.
[212:07.67]Oh OK, all of you have like a mythical weapon.
[212:11.61]Then it requires high level smithing stones to get to upgrade it, but they're all +2.
[212:16.27]I thought it was only some of them and that.
[212:20.60]Is a +2.
[212:28.50]that's why I'm saying it's a little bit of a waste to be getting these smithing stones because you'd want to upgrade a mythic ideally and then you aren't really ever going to use these here let me get them let me get them let me get this guy okay
[212:45.09]Can I hurt him once?
[212:46.34]I don't want you to get all the credit.
[212:47.62]I'm going to die.
[212:49.70]Why did I let you do that?
[212:51.16]Why did I let you do that?
[212:52.62]Because I don't have any healing.
[212:55.02]I had to commit.
[212:59.75]Oh, come on.
[213:00.19]You can beat him.
[213:02.73]Bro!
[213:05.55]I still feel like the dodge is off.
[213:07.23]I really do.
[213:16.71]I promise you the dodge is still wrong.
[213:22.54]I know the dodge is actually slightly different.
[213:26.50]I think they removed... There is an input delay normally in Elden Ring that they removed.
[213:33.20]So as such, your dodge timings may actually be a little off from normal Elden Ring.
[213:41.94]Are you serious?
[213:43.32]Yeah, I am.
[213:43.94]I'm not.
[213:44.52]I wouldn't joke with you, man.
[213:46.34]What I joke about that...
[214:04.08]Yeah, something does still feel strange when I hit the dodge button.
[214:09.44]Now, whether that's I'm getting hit in the middle of dodging or is it happening earlier?
[214:13.56]Yeah, my brain is having trouble with it.
[214:18.57]Oh, hi, bear.
[214:19.09]Oh, thank God.
[214:21.91]Dude, I can't go.
[214:22.83]I'm stuck.
[214:27.66]No, let me on.
[214:29.30]Alright, I'm good.
[214:31.48]I hope they all fall on us.
[214:37.89]okay we're good that is terrifying me it is very scary oh I know where the other the other Frenzied Flame thing is in that small village up in the uh on the top of that one hill where all the like frenzied rats are
[215:12.99]Oh yeah, there's the whole village.
[215:14.83]There's a whole like frenzied village.
[215:17.39]And they're all insane and their heretics and we need to kill them all.
[215:22.75]And then continue their traditions.
[215:27.31]I think we're being chased.
[215:37.21]OK, round two wild strikes.
[215:39.87]I'm just going to keep going.
[215:47.06]What if it kills you again though?
[215:48.32]We need your expertise.
[215:50.56]You better help because it's wild strike time.
[215:52.97]Okay.
[216:20.22]what the fuck
[216:30.69]I'm really gonna die to him again.
[216:32.75]I'm fucking around and I don't think it's a problem.
[216:35.47]No, I'm telling you.
[216:36.27]I think the dodge is fucked.
[216:38.03]I'm telling you.
[216:39.45]It's not.
[216:40.43]Are you sure?
[216:41.53]I'm sure.
[216:42.21]I'm sure that I watched that happen, did it to myself nearly on purpose.
[216:47.85]And I'm very sad that I did because it's really what I don't want to be dead.
[216:54.81]Well, we got it.
[216:56.93]I got all the items anyway.
[217:01.49]I got a legendary something.
[217:02.75]I need to like sit down.
[217:14.09]You know what?
[217:14.71]We need to sell all this crap.
[217:16.58]I'm going to confuse myself so much.
[217:18.08]Let's go back to Brother Kale.
[217:21.65]Because in my brain, like literally every single one of these is like the same.
[217:25.17]Because I have to hit X to look at what it actually does.
[217:28.07]Yeah, but in my brain, I'm dead right now and I can't do anything.
[217:31.13]So let's go to Kale.
[217:32.11]Okay.
[217:42.28]I know it's the gloves, but it's just like we're picking up so many things that have just random stats on them that everything just kind of gets lost.
[217:52.48]Okay.
[217:55.30]Is there a bonfire here somewhere?
[217:56.56]There's one down the elevator.
[218:00.98]You should be able to teleport without going down there.
[218:03.76]Don't you have to vote for it?
[218:09.08]Yeah, I do.
[218:12.04]You're right.
[218:12.73]He's right again.
[218:21.20]I mean, when you have like 30 of these in your inventory, it gets kind of hard to differentiate between which one is what.
[218:30.02]We definitely have to go sell all these.
[218:31.80]Or most of them.
[218:43.78]Okay.
[218:45.89]Coming back.
[218:49.36]Maybe some... No, I'll get Endurance though.
[218:54.24]So we're by time picked up.
[219:21.49]Item type order of acquisition.
[219:24.89]Okay.
[219:25.17]God.
[219:25.47]Okay.
[219:32.48]We, uh, we fell in a vote.
[219:35.36]I'm just, I'm just testing that out to see what it looks like.
[219:37.75]We, uh, we failing.
[219:39.53]Okay.
[219:42.43]Let's go.
[219:50.02]So who would you say is winning right now?
[219:52.36]Neither one of us.
[219:58.29]I think you're winning.
[220:01.61]You know who's truly winning?
[220:03.95]God and his servants.
[220:08.59]What are you buying here?
[220:09.98]I'm selling.
[220:16.11]That's what you wanted to sell things.
[220:18.33]What do you sell?
[220:18.77]I've heard.
[220:20.15]My weapons that I'm not going to be using.
[220:23.41]Alright.
[220:25.03]I'm going to dump all these talismans.
[220:30.15]Alright.
[220:30.41]+2 FP every.
[220:32.15]I mean, I don't.
[220:32.88]I don't know if it's worth holding on to some of these, but whatever.
[220:38.24]Plus 1.7 fire damage dealt.
[220:51.58]I'm going to just get rid of the ones that don't have three things on them, right?
[220:57.39]Plus, holy damage, four, three HP, one lightning damage, one three FP.
[221:03.93]Four, three is six, is eight, is four.
[221:08.18]Huh?
[221:13.08]That one's kind of good.
[221:13.96]Yeah.
[221:23.71]Extra lightning damage taken.
[221:28.31]I think I'm just going to get rid of anything that doesn't not... Whatever, I'm just going to go for it.
[221:32.41]I'll keep that.
[221:32.83]I'm just selling basically anything that's not equipped and I don't want to equip is gone.
[221:38.64]Unless it seems really interesting.
[221:42.92]Or a specific task.
[221:47.40]Oh, these are only worth 100.
[221:49.92]They are, but they're kind of just clogging up the inventory.
[221:52.09]Yeah.
[221:52.75]Yeah.
[222:05.90]Keep that one.
[222:12.66]1.3.
[222:13.90]1.2.
[222:17.74]I'm not going to put this on, probably.
[222:19.20]This one's kind of good.
[222:27.07]I think.
[222:27.37]Okay.
[222:32.03]Alright.
[222:36.36]Oh my God.
[222:38.68]That was a lot of money.
[222:39.28]I don't have enough.
[222:58.16]God damn it.
[222:58.64]It was 86.
[223:11.45]Alright, 15 endurance is fine.
[223:13.04]I'll keep that for now.
[223:20.66]Okay.
[223:24.16]Well then.
[223:25.36]Arcane plus 2, 3 HP.
[223:27.49]Oh my god, those are good.
[223:28.43]Holy shit.
[223:31.51]5 FP every 3.5 seconds?
[223:32.71]3.2 seconds?
[223:33.43]Damn.
[223:33.61]Hmm.
[223:38.43]OK, we never even went South and cross that bridge.
[223:43.34]Do you still want to go back into Kaelin?
[223:45.82]We should go South to the ailing village to get you your frenzy fire.
[223:52.77]Yeah, we kind of.
[223:54.19]We kind of went that way and then we decided to do something else.
[223:56.25]And now we're I guess we're
[223:58.54]Mm-hmm.
[223:59.34]Is that what we're doing?
[224:00.00]Is that the plan?
[224:00.92]Yeah.
[224:01.14]So let's go to gate front.
[224:02.08]We got a long path.
[224:03.50]So I'm going to need you to bring up a very engaging topic for the journey.
[224:08.30]Okay.
[224:11.04]Dig down into your bag of tricks.
[224:16.14]I am pressing it, but it will not go.
[224:19.92]Aw, shucks.
[224:22.96]Aw, shucks.
[224:32.88]I don't think we can cut across here.
[224:37.42]Actually, I think we can.
[224:38.36]Let's just go from here.
[224:40.28]Okay.
[224:43.18]Yeah, you can.
[224:43.74]I just assume everywhere in Elden Ring is like a gigantic cave that will prevent you from going anywhere.
[224:54.01]Or not cave, cliff.
[224:56.05]A big valley.
[224:58.07]Yes.
[224:59.21]It does end up that way a lot of the places, though.
[225:15.64]oh I got a rare power bottoms greaves ooh
[225:43.06]Where are we going here?
[225:49.64]Who's fighting who here?
[225:50.52]Oh, it's a bear.
[225:51.62]A bear is fighting the dragon.
[225:55.61]Who wins?
[225:59.25]16 damage.
[225:59.97]They're not even hurting each other.
[226:01.67]Wait, what?
[226:02.09]Bear's dead.
[226:03.45]No, he's not.
[226:03.89]The bear has a fucking full health.
[226:05.63]Oh, wait.
[226:06.94]I thought it laid down like it was done.
[226:08.92]They're not hurting each other at all.
[226:10.60]Yeah, why not?
[226:13.40]Is that Deckard Cain?
[226:17.49]Well, they'll figure it out.

[234:57.54]Another stone sword key if we need it.
[235:05.11]Can we make a short little detour and get the best item in the game?
[235:10.58]Which one?
[235:12.02]The turtle shield.
[235:16.35]If that is your heart's desire, let's do it.
[235:18.81]I think it's up here on the left on like one of those towers.
[235:23.48]Either that or we just passed it.
[235:24.92]It's either up here or we just passed it.
[235:26.96]One of those two.
[235:31.50]It's up here.
[235:43.37]Okay.
[235:45.05]It's up here.
[235:49.38]Frenzied Flame.
[235:51.42]The village of the fire.
[235:52.87]Didn't take this thing?
[235:55.27]We should take it.
[235:59.35]I don't need it.
[236:00.07]You don't want to miss a bonfire.
[236:01.65]It... What?

[236:25.24]It's like up in here, right?
[236:27.46]It's in the tower.
[236:28.42]You can use the air jump to go straight into the tower.
[236:30.78]Oh, you can?
[236:31.24]Cool.
[236:31.82]Do that.
[236:32.22]Yeah.

[241:16.62]That's what like got me to make us go do this.
[241:18.52]You're like, oh, if we play the game long enough for me to get the frenzy skills.

[241:25.38]Well, one of them is.
[241:25.98]Alright, I have.
[241:28.82]Let me put on.
[241:31.81]This thing is too good to take off, though, isn't it?
[241:33.95]10% frenzy flame versus.
[241:39.35]God.
[241:40.71]Three HP every second.

[241:45.62]Alright, I'm now a Frenzied Flame.
[241:51.06]This is gonna be fun.
[241:51.56]89.
[241:58.97]The spear too, but the spear needs something else, right?
[242:12.43]I need 20.
[242:13.15]I need a bunch of decks to put this on.
[242:15.83]Or a lot more strength.
[242:17.69]I'm OK with my spells.
[242:23.56]I'm OK.
[242:24.64]I feel totally fine.
[242:34.27]I feel very strong actually.
[242:46.09]I swear there's a place you can jump down here um then I also don't swear this is the part of the game where it started to be like cliff hell this place is cliff hell every time I'm like oh I have to like go down to that like western area down here in the the island place and then I how do you get to that bridge because you can see it from like 30 different cliffs
[243:11.97]oh man relax I'm about to just start spitting do you want to just go to Caelid instead come here no come here come here no come here listen to me come here listen to me come here where are you I dropped down okay
[243:42.00]Oh, you did find out.
[243:43.26]This is the right way.
[243:48.44]I just followed you the whole time.
[243:51.72]You just said, Simon says jump and follow me.
[243:54.17]And I just did it.
[243:54.65]Oh, you think you're smarter than me?
[244:06.13]I know you can get down there, though.
[244:18.65]And there's a cave.
[244:20.69]Okay.
[244:24.39]Yeah, they are.
[244:36.78]Alright.
[244:37.22]Where are you?
[244:38.22]Are you still adamant on... I picked up my souls at the same spot.
[244:41.64]Oh, no.
[244:42.10]I know how you get down here.
[244:43.59]I'm dead again.
[244:47.03]I'm deadpilled.
[244:50.21]You want me to spawn you?
[244:51.31]I'm going to be at the bonfire and I'm going to show you one simple trick how to travel through Leah and Leah.
[245:04.35]I'm following you.
[245:33.79]Here's the one precise spot that you should go down these cliffs.
[245:46.06]Thank God.
[245:47.28]Thank God I just did that.
[245:48.60]You would have heard me scream.
[245:51.54]I would have been like... You do sound like that when you're mad.
[245:58.75]This thing's actually kind of cool.
[246:04.28]The friends need fire!
[246:08.92]Don't fuck with me.
[246:15.96]That's a real epic of you.
[246:23.79]Sure you know what you're doing?
[246:29.53]No.
[246:35.72]easy okay cave let's go do you want to go in the cave do you want to do cave yes I think I remember this cave being scary is that one cave where like there's there's two of the worst bosses in the game there's like an invisible necromancer and then something just as bad and also it's very very dark very scary
[247:01.94]I don't know.
[247:02.20]We didn't buy any lanterns or anything.
[247:03.84]That was probably a pretty bad idea.
[247:05.99]I've got a torch.
[247:07.89]Yeah, a torch is not a lantern.
[247:08.75]You have to equip it.
[247:10.77]Yeah, that's way more immersive.
[247:12.45]Annoying.
[247:16.85]Watch out, wizard.
[247:17.48]Well, you know what?
[247:18.40]I'm going to be doing the rest of the entire time we play.
[247:20.00]Watch out, wizard.
[247:20.56]Don't worry.
[247:26.44]I have madness.
[247:28.06]Madness.
[247:36.67]You're really just gonna stand up here and piss on all of them.
[247:40.25]Oh shit, something's wrong with me.
[247:42.38]Oh right, you can't do that that many.
[247:43.46]Alright, right, right, right.
[247:44.60]Oh look out!
[247:45.12]Lightning!
[247:46.08]Wizard!
[247:55.56]Ooh, this is interesting.
[247:56.56]How many times did I say there's a wizard there?
[247:59.54]I'm fine.
[248:05.43]I keep hearing your guys scream.
[248:09.03]Alright, don't go too far into the madness.
[248:12.74]You will never return.
[248:13.76]Ooh.
[248:25.80]Ooh.
[248:26.62]Yeah, what was that?
[248:30.70]Eight FP every two seconds?
[248:34.95]I mean, that's kind of insane.
[248:37.27]That is an AU if you ask me.
[248:40.05]That's better than 10% more damage, I think.
[248:44.65]Yeah, I'd take that.
[248:51.40]Wow.
[248:54.68]I apologize, Ster, in advance.
[248:56.80]This character's going to be very annoying.
[248:59.68]I like it.
[249:01.24]I already love it.
[249:02.12]It's just going to be... It felt like my character all last run was constantly screaming every time they got hurt.
[249:16.95]Just Arnold.
[249:21.52]Arnold.
[249:25.27]Okay.
[249:25.81]What do we got?
[249:29.75]I don't know.
[249:30.33]I'm opening it as fast as I can.
[249:31.69]It's heavy.
[249:32.13]Help.
[249:32.67]Help.
[249:33.29]I don't know what it could be.
[249:34.23]Oh, we're going to die.
[249:34.91]We're dead.
[249:35.75]Uh oh.
[249:42.24]Imagine knowing this enemy's moveset.
[249:44.64]You got to be shitting me.
[249:51.12]Spit me out.
[249:55.80]And I'm in.
[249:58.00]Man, it's just for real life.
[249:59.29]What are you saying?
[250:04.59]Dude, that was pretty frenzy.

[250:14.10]My eyes.
[250:19.40]Ow.
[250:32.83]That was pretty frenzy.
[250:33.83]I got a bunch of items, I think.
[250:36.93]Yeah, it just keeps giving us things.
[250:41.70]Like, come on.
[250:42.90]Is frenzy stuff lightning, holy, or fire damage?
[250:47.06]What actual damage is it?
[250:52.20]I don't know.
[250:53.84]It's all fire.
[250:54.84]Okay.
[251:05.89]I have pants that heals others but not the wearer it doesn't say how much okay uh you have missing health I'm gonna stand near you with my pants on I just put on some regen oh like I guess I guess we wouldn't be able to know where how much I'm healing you doesn't seem like a lot either way
[251:30.93]It's not a whole lot, but hey, it's still something.
[251:33.79]And yeah, I'm just going to go back to where my power bottom.
[251:40.30]Cool.

[256:46.06]But it's not just a sentence.
[256:47.14]It's like, it's like 10, it's like six to seven words in a string that have no real connection to each other.
[256:53.08]You fell in.
[256:55.30]Oh, so you, yeah, we got to keep going down.
[256:59.67]That's why, like, some of the Type Racer stuff is harder, because, you know, the words, like, they don't flow together.
[257:04.38]Like, what is it?
[257:05.80]Demigod's Restorative Traveling Maiden Gloves.
[257:08.36]It's like, it's a lot of random words.
[257:12.40]I'm right there with you.
[257:13.08]Can you Frenzy Flame this thing?
[257:14.48]Yep.
[257:33.79]It's like the text for those items here are tongue twisters.
[257:37.28]All of them.
[257:39.02]They are.
[257:39.60]They're really long and they really don't make any sense.
[257:43.98]There's no way to speak the English language.
[257:47.90]I've tried.
[257:57.94]I wonder what attack you're going to do.
[258:00.64]That one.
[258:02.07]I wonder what I'm going to do.
[258:02.97]This is such a boring playthrough.
[258:19.66]This is just you and I are both going to do the same one move.
[258:24.92]Oh, my God.
[258:25.50]Look out.
[258:41.29]Oh damn.
[258:46.48]Oh shit.
[258:47.98]What's that?
[258:48.46]It's a boss brush.
[258:59.66]Treasured Mad Tongue's Chain Leggings of Fury.
[259:12.56]Holy damage.
[259:16.37]Wait, you can roll into enemies and hurt them?
[259:19.15]Yeah, I've seen a couple items with that.
[259:20.41]That's pretty sick.
[259:28.09]Hmm.
[259:30.44]I'm going to try it.
[259:35.07]Sounds funny.
[259:35.51]I've got my second moon veil.
[259:39.59]Very cool.
[259:41.51]Not going to use it.
[259:43.01]Trying to do some strength stuff.
[259:44.35]Can only find this club.
[259:45.57]Alright.
[259:46.27]Do you want to go to Ray LaCario?
[259:48.22]Do you want to do Kalid?
[259:51.16]There's the other tower where you can get the madness grab.
[259:55.66]Let's set you up, man.
[259:57.04]You want to set me up?
[259:58.00]You deserve it.
[260:00.29]You're one of the good ones.
[260:01.21]Hey, thank you, I guess.
[260:04.63]These hoes ain't loyal.
[260:08.05]Alright, where we going?
[260:09.55]Back to the, uh... Where we were trying to go before?
[260:13.27]Frenzy Flame Tower?
[260:14.83]I'm trying to remember... Frenzy Flame Village up here.
[260:21.28]I don't know if you see my markers.
[260:24.48]Uh, I know where it is.
[260:25.24]Yeah.
[260:26.22]It's like part of this whole tower and...
[260:30.42]And we have the crystal tunnel there, but I think we have to go all the way from back here.
[260:35.75]You can go up the middle of like from the lake, but we haven't got any good waypoints.
[260:40.65]We were trying to cross the whole lake earlier.
[260:43.99]Here, here, here, here, here, here.
[260:47.02]I know where we're going.
[260:48.18]It's just a long trek.
[260:49.30]It's alright.
[261:15.03]Remember, my game takes slightly longer than yours to load.
[261:19.69]Yeah, I know.
[261:20.15]I wait for you every single time with my overflowing vessel of great helm patience of the fourth born.
[261:30.45]Can you say that five times fast?
[261:32.15]I don't even remember what I just said.
[261:33.44]I really am just saying words.
[261:37.16]They all, they're right about me.
[261:44.90]and I'm also gonna stop saying hey there's a thing we can go in right here I'm just we're just gonna go you know um we can't get to it from this way we got to go into the lake again trust yeah you have to go through the middle right yeah because then there's one of those uh there's one of those cliffs that you know just just the world
[262:14.01]You got to go up from the middle.
[262:18.57]Don't you think the Earth would be better off if it was perfectly flat?
[262:24.49]I'm not saying like flat Earth theory.
[262:25.99]I'm saying like it's a round planet still, but it is perfectly flat.
[262:30.08]No mountains, no hills, no rivers.
[262:33.10]Well, gravity exists, so it doesn't really matter.
[262:38.27]So, I mean, like... No... Wait, you mean, like... You mean literal flat.
[262:44.35]Like, the whole thing is flat.
[262:45.69]Everything.
[262:46.13]Yeah.
[262:46.87]Yeah.
[262:48.71]So, you just want, like, the Great Plains across the entire world.
[262:52.09]Yes.
[262:52.79]Yes.
[262:54.59]Um... So, you're talking about you want the Roller Coaster Tycoon default grass.
[263:01.02]Yes.
[263:01.46]Alright.
[263:02.36]Um... I want default grass map.
[263:05.68]from the tutorial level of like that sounds so awesome just no just everything is exactly just green I I feel like there's probably reasons why it would be bad but but here's the trade-off uh it's like a dwarven ecosystem underground where these massive caverns and these ores we've never heard of that can let the elves live forever but we won't let them have them but they get them
[263:36.86]Huh?
[263:38.42]What are you saying?
[263:40.56]What are you saying?
[263:44.84]The world above is flat, but because that's all flat, we can't have rivers, so obviously we wouldn't have water to irrigate or anything.
[263:51.15]I feel like I just skipped 10 minutes forward in a YouTube video.
[263:55.29]Like there's something else completely going on.
[263:57.37]Alright, let's do it.
[264:08.84]What was he cooking?
[264:09.92]It's a great question.
[264:19.34]You could have just said no.
[264:21.05]Like, a valid answer was just no.
[264:22.97]I don't think that would be better.
[264:26.07]But no one wants to, like, speak up.
[264:29.05]Conflict averse.
[264:30.15]How windy would it get?
[264:33.75]I feel like if it was all just roller coaster tycoon grass...
[264:38.85]That's a good question.
[264:40.27]We would change the dynamic of all of our meteorology.
[264:46.02]Doesn't a lot of wind come from the melting of the ocean?
[264:51.46]I don't know.
[264:53.58]I feel like you're going to change a lot.
[264:54.52]When the ocean melts into the clouds, and if there was no water on the surface because it's all flat, then the ocean wouldn't be melting.
[265:14.88]So true.
[265:15.48]Yeah, I've got a lot of question marks.
[265:18.27]Okay, so if ice melts into water and then water can change into gas behind you, we call that melting.
[265:25.53]Why can't water melt into gas?
[265:32.44]Water flame cleanse me in there.
[265:34.36]If you care, we probably don't care.
[265:51.30]Oh, that hurt.
[265:56.64]I thought that was you hitting me from behind.
[266:00.02]Alright, stop, please.
[266:01.80]This guy has been in the same animation the whole time.
[266:04.50]Is he just wild striking?
[266:07.58]I don't know.
[266:08.38]He's just doing wild strike.
[266:10.03]Whatever he was doing.
[266:13.05]This thing's one hit.
[266:13.81]Can you just, like, fucking go crazy?
[266:19.59]Oh, thank God.
[266:21.09]We're good.
[266:23.85]It evaporates like vapor doesn't freeze into water.
[266:25.93]It condenses.
[266:26.77]There you go.
[266:28.73]There's your answer.
[266:29.37]It condenses.
[266:33.03]And that guy's not like you're not, no one's doing question marks to that guy.
[266:36.19]Well, that's baked with real science.
[266:41.87]Not nutrient pellet science that you're using.
[266:47.15]When's the last time you opened like a science book?
[266:52.25]Don't you think just like feeling from your gut, like how the heart feels is enough?
[266:57.76]Do you really even need to know like, oh, I need to like read a biology book to understand how my body works.
[267:03.64]You just kind of like you sit on the toilet, shit happens.
[267:06.58]You don't need to know the mechanics of the world to understand that water can melt.
[267:15.08]Okay, water can evaporate.
[267:19.13]Okay, and why does the word melt not work here?
[267:23.05]Because melting implies... Melting implies... Correct me if I'm wrong.
[267:28.71]Melting implies a heat source, does it not?
[267:34.09]Well, if it gets hot enough out, the water melts.
[267:38.15]Melting, doesn't that mean it needs to melt?
[267:41.06]There is heat involved.
[267:42.20]Not necessarily.
[267:47.59]Melting is from solid to liquid.
[267:50.81]Melting implies liquidification.
[268:00.19]Does it imply that or are you like expecting that it can only mean that?
[268:07.64]I think you're fighting semantics right now.
[268:19.43]NA education.
[268:21.13]Guys, don't blame NA.
[268:22.45]I'm a dropout.
[268:23.19]I dropped out of high school.
[268:25.61]This is not NA's fault.
[268:34.50]He said, dude, my brain is melting listening to you.
[268:38.30]Oh, but he can say that and I can't say water melts.
[268:40.74]You just hurt the turtle.
[268:45.19]I jumped on him and it does damage when you try and stand on him.
[268:48.13]I just tried to stand on him.
[268:49.72]Ster, if there's one person I have ever heard of that would ever hit the turtle, it's you.
[268:54.01]I didn't hit him.
[268:54.89]I tried to be on his back.
[268:56.59]Yep.
[268:57.99]Like, imagine you're a small child.
[268:59.45]Didn't you ever want to, like, ride a big dog?
[269:01.14]I'm busy.
[269:01.96]I'm busy.
[269:12.75]Yeah, Ster the type of guy to R1, R1, R1 the turtle and then be like... Actually, Wild Strike is just hold L2 for me.
[269:21.55]It's a lot simpler than R1, R1, R1.
[269:26.44]I can't handle that many button presses.
[269:28.22]Ster the type of guy to hold L2 on the turtle.
[269:35.86]Okay.
[269:37.28]You didn't even talk to the turtles.
[269:39.46]I don't need sorceries.
[269:45.08]Alright, let's go fight something.
[269:46.04]Let's go fight.
[269:46.68]Let's go fight like regular Kario or you know what we're doing right now and why we're doing it.
[269:51.28]Yes, but I know we're doing the Frenzied Flame village.
[269:55.04]Do you know how close we are and how far we traveled to get here for you?
[269:58.20]But you keep pausing and talking about sauce.
[270:00.56]I'm not.
[270:00.88]We've been traveling the whole time.
[270:02.59]You've been saucing.
[270:13.67]I just need to look at the map and you're fighting all these guys.
[270:16.31]Who is the item here?
[270:20.34]Violet.
[270:39.63]OK.
[270:40.17]Any any any map lookers?
[270:43.98]I would like to look.
[270:47.02]Oh, that's sad that dog has a collar.
[270:48.58]OK, so yeah, it's the tower.
[270:53.53]There's a village.
[270:55.11]We gotta go down this Hill.
[270:58.47]I don't know who came up this Hill.
[271:07.21]The melting conversation you had is why America isn't top 10 in stem.
[271:14.95]I haven't been in a classroom in like 15 years.
[271:20.93]Wait, top 10 in STEM?
[271:28.12]There's like not even, there's barely more than 10 countries.
[271:37.32]Guys, when you get to be over 30, you stop giving a shit about melting versus condensation.
[271:42.74]You give a shit about fucking taxes, alright?
[271:44.55]Got a fucking lawn to take care of.
[271:47.05]Ah, shit.
[271:50.31]I think my game crashed.
[271:55.37]True?
[271:56.10]No way.
[271:56.64]Dude, every time you turn on the news, it's all China this, Russia that, China this, Russia that, USA.
[272:01.56]There's like three countries.
[272:18.76]Something in the fucking water today.
[272:20.36]Something in the sauce today.
[272:27.74]What?
[272:27.94]Name another one.
[272:30.30]Canada.
[272:32.34]Mexico.
[272:32.60]I mean, come on.
[272:33.62]Alright.
[272:33.98]Finland.
[272:38.76]Switzerland.
[272:39.54]Sweden.
[272:39.88]Got a little, like a show-off scholar here.
[272:42.14]You want to play GeoGuessr again and see what happens?
[272:44.22]Wait, wait, wait.
[272:44.56]I'm not done.
[272:46.26]Ahem.
[272:47.29]Germany, France, England.
[272:53.05]Should I... You want more?
[272:53.99]Should I go?
[272:54.41]Should I keep going?
[272:56.43]Unless you want to play GeoGuessr again.
[272:58.03]Ecuador.
[273:01.89]My world is open to wanderers.
[273:09.49]Egypt.
[273:12.19]What ranking is Egypt in STEM?
[273:13.65]I don't know.
[273:40.49]we're talking about stem cells right where I can like like how many years before I can have gills Ster I have I gotta tell you I I know that this has been like a jokey conversation where we're just like pretending that we don't actually know this stuff but you have to understand that there are chatters that are going to hear you say that and they're gonna they're gonna think even less of us oh I I'm well aware
[274:06.63]I am totally and completely aware.
[274:09.09]And I, you know, I had an awakening.
[274:13.99]I shouldn't even say more.
[274:15.05]You know what?
[274:16.93]I shouldn't say more.
[274:18.40]Where am I?
[274:19.06]I don't know.
[274:20.08]Awakening?
[274:20.86]We gotta go up this side.
[274:21.88]I don't want to explain it.
[274:23.28]I realize, like, it's a... Wait, you shouldn't hear about the awakening.
[274:27.36]You guys don't want to know about the awakening.
[274:29.38]I don't know if I want to hear about the awakening.
[274:31.20]I'm not sure about that.
[274:32.20]I don't know if I want to hear about the awakening.
[274:43.24]Tell us... All I'll say about the awakening is... And that some people are... I don't want to hear about the awakening.
[274:49.96]I don't want to hear about the awakening.
[274:52.09]I think it's too much for me to hear about the awakening right now.
[274:54.43]I can't see the map again.
[274:55.63]Where are we going?
[274:56.45]I don't want to hear about this.
[274:58.41]I feel like this is the kind of shit... You're going to start talking about fucking like crystals and gems.
[275:03.19]And you're going to start talking about like fucking the Earth being flat...
[275:07.04]Your alarms are going off because you're like, something this motherfucker won't even say?
[275:11.22]Uh-huh.
[275:12.06]Nuh-uh.
[275:12.78]I don't want to hear about the awakening.
[275:22.69]Alright, fair enough.
[275:23.61]Alright, how about this?
[275:25.45]You DM me what, like, one sentence of what the awakening is.
[275:29.98]No, it's not that bad if I, like, leave out the important parts.
[275:35.13]Alright, tell me off stream.
[275:37.17]No, I don't even want to.
[275:40.41]We can talk about it later, but it wouldn't make sense.
[275:48.26]The full context is required, of which you would not have.
[275:54.63]There is awakening.
[275:57.17]I went down.
[275:58.06]I was concerned about your awakening, so I went down here.
[276:00.96]I don't know why I called it an awakening.
[276:03.52]It's not an awakening.
[276:06.54]It's hard to even relate to what the original conversation was because I can't remember what we were talking about.
[276:13.23]We're talking about how many countries you can name.
[276:15.82]No, like after that.
[276:18.68]About, oh, people thinking that we're as dumb as we are.
[276:20.44]People think we're dumb.
[276:21.50]Like, oh, they're dumb.
[276:23.00]They don't know anything about condensation.
[276:25.34]Yeah, that was where we left that.
[276:26.98]And then you said, I had an awakening.
[276:28.70]And I don't know if I can even say it on stream.
[276:31.88]The short version is, which is fine, is that when I stream with you, I never get Twitter DMs.
[276:39.32]But when I stream with you afterwards...
[276:42.51]Sometimes I get a few that are like, can you not talk about that ever again?
[276:49.28]Wait, like from people you know?
[276:51.10]Or from like random people?
[276:52.28]No, no, no, from like random people that I've, like long messages about like why what I said was actually...
[276:59.35]Like, did you know, like, I could imagine getting one, like, it was kind of really saddening to hear you say there was only 10 countries, because actually I'm from one that isn't one of those 10, and I really felt like I was personally... So your concern is you're here on, like, a comedy stream, and you're afraid that you're going to get DMs where people think that you actually mean the thing you say on the comedy stream.
[277:22.62]Well, it's kind of what you were saying, is that people will think we're that dumb.
[277:27.80]And I...
[277:29.71]I don't know why, also, I don't know why I called that an awakening.
[277:32.57]Yeah, that, uh, to me, you were talking, okay, you, let's, let's go over some very factual information.
[277:40.09]We, you, first of all, you were like, I don't even know if I want to talk about this on stream.
[277:44.09]And that was, like, transitioning out of, like, you know, you know, is the Earth flat?
[277:49.52]Like, yeah, wouldn't it be better if the Earth was flat?
[277:52.24]You know, like, you know what I mean, Jarva?
[277:53.78]And I'm just like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[277:56.44]And then, you know what?
[277:57.44]I had an awakening recently.
[277:58.92]Let me tell you all about it.
[278:00.34]And I'm just like, oh, okay.
[278:04.23]What was it?
[278:06.59]There's a longer awakening.
[278:09.37]I just, you know.
[278:13.55]That's what too long didn't read.
[278:15.27]That's all you need to know.
[278:18.42]Okay.
[278:20.78]And first of all, why do you have Twitter DMs open?
[278:26.26]open what you why don't you why would you have Twitter dms open for any Twitter user to just dm your ass why not Ster I I'm telling you right now you just told like tens of thousands of people that you have open dms on Twitter like what like what is the worst thing that happens please do not I read one go oh my god
[278:54.00]man like do you just not interact with your fans no okay fair I I thought there would be more nuance watch out for the big hand watch out for the big hand it's up on that hill up here but I don't think you can actually get up on that hill unless you come from the other direction this is where it's hill hill cliff hell when you look at the map
[279:23.24]So yeah, where were we?
[279:24.01]You want to go to Caelan?
[279:27.92]Yes.
[279:36.58]No, I don't really use Twitter.
[279:38.41]I don't use Discord.
[279:40.33]Because here's the thing.
[279:42.71]Let's be real.
[279:43.61]You want to be real for a second?
[279:45.63]If I have Twitter DMs open, and somebody DMs me, and I just ignore it.
[279:50.45]Because, I mean, let's be realistic.
[279:52.90]It's possible that thousands of them could come in in a week or a month period.
[279:59.34]I'm telling you right now, I'm not going to read them.
[280:01.22]I'm not going to read them all.
[280:02.10]I'm just not going to.
[280:03.08]And if somebody sends a bunch of text to something,
[280:07.49]Let's say you wrote like two or three paragraphs, like a Twitter DM, and I just don't even open it because it's just overwhelming.
[280:12.19]There's too much.
[280:13.21]Then you spent the time to write to me and I just didn't even respond.
[280:18.95]There you go.
[280:20.37]Okay.
[280:20.71]Plus, I don't want to interact.
[280:23.62]I mean, how many people just wrote to you in your chat that you didn't respond to just now while you were saying that?
[280:30.38]The difference, there's a character limit.
[280:34.46]Is there?
[280:35.26]You can write some pretty long... I guess remove my nightbot.
[280:46.47]TL;DR.
[280:47.71]It can be pretty overwhelming.
[280:49.45]And I... I prefer to not do it.
[280:54.19]TL;DR.
[280:58.00]Why did you open this?
[281:00.40]I don't know.
[281:00.78]We were just up here and we can't really get to where we were trying to go to.
[281:05.33]So I think we probably do need to, like, leave.
[281:12.13]Unless we... You are.
[281:16.05]You are just going on my screen.
[281:19.03]Oh, I'm sitting in place.
[281:21.23]That happens a lot around these altars, actually, is where we've had a lot of the desync.
[281:27.35]It does seem to happen here.
[281:28.37]Okay.
[281:28.85]Do you want to just pick a place to reset us?
[281:32.15]um yep we are going into the smoldering church do not touch this bonfire
[281:42.75]Let's get random DMs from random strangers.
[281:46.25]I don't.
[281:47.67]To me, that's just like, oh, hey, let me open up my Twitter DMs.
[281:50.81]Oh, that's a picture of somebody given a double middle finger and their asshole.
[281:54.92]OK, that's cool.
[281:56.02]I don't think people consciously thinking of Ster and being like, you know what?
[282:00.62]I'm going to interact with Ster.
[282:02.46]That has never been a problem.
[282:04.58]And I don't think like maybe they're like, oh, because I said like, oh, I said on stream, like for one day it'll be a problem.
[282:10.61]Then it'll go back to like,
[282:12.40]You know, I'm just like alone in my basement.
[282:14.57]Lights off.
[282:22.09]Boundaries Bob.
[282:23.37]Yeah, I've set them before with you guys.
[282:28.80]Come on.
[282:29.72]Don't act like we haven't.
[282:38.97]Ooh, it's putrid Theodoryx.
[282:42.56]Nah, keep going.
[282:43.12]There's a cave.
[282:46.92]Yeah, keep going because that didn't even hurt.
[282:53.98]I mean, my weapon is still... I never gave it plus levels.
[282:58.81]I think we were starting to hit some things that are outscaling us.
[283:04.23]Yeah, we probably should upgrade after this.
[283:10.46]you don't want to interact with random people no I I really don't does that make me a bad person no it makes me somebody that is set hold on counter to that you used to do like like pax east meetup I can't I can't do a meetup oh that's different though
[283:34.92]or wherever the very opposite ends of the spectrum there.
[283:38.68]I think that's different, though.
[283:39.60]I mean, we're all there for that purpose of, like, kind of being in the same place.
[283:43.58]Bunch of gamers, bunch of streamers are there, bunch of YouTubers, bunch of people.
[283:47.47]To me, that's different.
[283:49.53]Like, I'm going to, like, a Twitch con or a PAX East to go that I can all hang out and talk to everybody.
[283:55.65]That's, like, the point.
[283:58.35]Yo, let these flames fly.
[284:01.03]Frenzy these fucks.
[284:05.86]Pretty good.
[284:06.28]I'll cover you.
[284:08.86]He just ran by me.
[284:16.33]Oh, my God.
[284:17.35]This whole hallway is full.
[284:19.29]Why is there a bear?
[284:26.78]Were you just surprised at what type of enemy was in this total randomizer where every enemy is random and you said, is that a bear?
[284:32.64]Like you were shocked.
[284:34.01]I feel like we've seen a lot of bears.
[284:36.31]We've seen a few bears.
[284:37.97]Is that?
[284:47.07]Yeah, it is rot.
[284:47.95]Okay.
[284:55.29]This is building.
[284:55.87]Oh, because I rolled.
[284:57.57]I'm an idiot.
[284:58.19]I keep forgetting that.
[285:02.87]Do I even have any of those things?
[285:04.03]No.
[285:04.37]Why would we have one of those?
[285:05.26]Okay.
[285:07.28]Where do we go from here?
[285:11.44]Can I touch the thing?
[285:12.20]I have rot.
[285:14.14]Yeah.
[285:14.54]You can touch the thing.
[285:19.07]I don't know where you go from there.
[285:21.77]I feel like one of these walls must be fraudulent.
[285:24.91]People are asking what's the difference between randomizers.
[285:27.61]This randomizer is like kind of doubly weirdly randomized because we have Diablo II loot and it's a lot of it and then we have... it's just all different.
[285:39.97]We're more likely to get weirder bosses in boss rooms and the items have a lot of bonus extra weird stats.
[285:49.42]You coming back?
[285:50.56]I am coming back.
[285:51.12]Where are you?
[285:52.18]I touched the thing because I was rotted.
[285:55.46]But I like hear... Oh.
[285:57.48]Well, you go underneath this.
[285:58.40]Someone was shooting me.
[286:00.32]You let this go up.
[286:01.62]Come off, you go under.
[286:04.07]So it's not different at all?
[286:05.39]I just... We have Diablo II random loot.
[286:07.19]What do you mean?
[286:07.63]Like, look at all this shit.
[286:11.35]This is all like random shit.
[286:13.73]And we have Elden Ring reforged, but we can't do the actual classes, so that's unfortunate.
[286:24.38]I brought us here to the Scarlet Rock Cave.
[286:26.54]It's all good.
[286:33.73]Hold on.
[286:41.93]This Kayled trip has been really... I fucking did the dodge again.
[286:47.03]We did like six circles to get to Kayled by now.
[286:53.17]We're in Caelid.
[286:54.75]Not the place that I want to be in Caelid.
[286:57.03]No, we gotta get the lever.
[286:59.10]Where do you want to be in Caelid?
[287:00.60]I want to be in the place where we can get some gold items.
[287:08.96]Where is this one?
[287:10.83]I have no idea.
[287:15.71]Uh, can you just go find it?
[287:16.51]Uh, okay.
[287:18.61]Can you start a conversation?
[287:19.97]Sure.
[287:21.84]So...
[287:26.69]When was the last time you had a... Does your jaw... Does your jaw click when you open it?
[287:38.84]Yes.
[287:39.50]It does.
[287:40.32]How... How far open does your mouth have to be before it clicks?
[287:45.90]Like... Mine's about... 30 or 40%?
[287:48.58]Pretty much every time.
[287:52.30]Um...
[287:54.42]I don't know I'm doing it now I don't know happens at like weird spots sometimes it feels like it does it more than others I remember I had like a long conversation with someone about this at one point because uh Ashley's sister is a dental surgeon and then I don't know I can't remember what I learned I'm gonna be honest
[288:15.97]That conversation started and stopped instantly.
[288:20.39]You know, I know somebody that's a dental surgeon and I don't remember anything.
[288:24.17]I'm sorry.
[288:24.67]I don't remember the whole thing.
[288:25.63]Like, I feel like I should be able to have more input on this conversation, but honestly, I don't.
[288:31.42]That just, well, you know what?
[288:32.72]Respect to you for acknowledging that you don't know and not just kind of making up something you might half know, right?
[288:40.70]I could do that.
[288:41.82]I could just talk.
[288:58.27]just out here playing the game looking for the lever for my uh I didn't want to get the rod I had it I was already built up he went on my website and bought a carry I'm looking
[289:11.68]I was like, yeah, fine, I'll do another carry for you on your Elden Ring streams.
[289:14.87]I'm looking.
[289:16.81]I found it.
[289:18.17]I found it.
[289:18.95]You didn't even find it.
[289:20.77]I found it.
[289:22.15]Did you?
[289:22.57]Maybe.
[289:28.31]Oh, and that giant pile of enemies, I ignored them.
[289:34.64]Oh, God.
[289:34.90]Oh, God.
[289:53.61]Cool.
[289:53.91]You found it?
[290:17.48]cool um you find it I was just giving you because then yeah I came up here and I didn't see it up here and then that dropped back down to where we were and it's like man what was the point isn't this one like in a weird spot
[290:45.62]I think so I think maybe you can also go up on that I don't dude I don't know I remember hating this cave because scarlet rot and they just need to make you hate yourself when you come in here I thought you were ending your stream I thought you said I I thought you said I gotta sleep
[291:12.22]I GOTTA SLEEP!
[291:14.10]Like, alright, see you later.
[291:15.38]It's just I realized all at once this is too late.
[291:18.74]It's like, oh my god, I'm gonna be up at 4am tomorrow for something incredibly important.
[291:22.88]I GOTTA SLEEP!
[291:26.05]Oh shit, alright man, go out.
[291:27.59]Yeah, take care.
[291:28.21]And he's gone.
[291:29.97]He didn't say goodbye.
[291:31.19]He just left.
[291:34.31]Like, if you miss this appointment tomorrow at 4 in the morning at 3, like, you gotta be up.
[291:40.62]4am.
[291:43.64]Yeah, I don't know.
[291:44.12]You can come to the doctor's office at 4am.
[291:45.92]We're all booked up, but if you can come in at 4am... Um... Still waiting for this door to open.
[291:54.38]Dude, I have no idea where it is.
[292:00.02]What, you've never played Elden Ring before?
[292:02.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[292:03.71]I'm remembering.
[292:04.77]Have you never played Elden Ring?
[292:06.41]I thought you played this game.
[292:11.05]Haven't you beaten this game before?
[292:15.20]Why don't you know?
[292:18.86]This doesn't come back down.
[292:19.92]So we do have to do a loop.
[292:22.28]Oh, oh, oh.
[292:24.51]Oh, I'm going to get Scarlet Rot.
[292:31.99]You can just go wait at that door.
[292:33.89]I'm just already following you.
[292:37.63]We got some marinara sauce on our boots.
[292:41.24]Some penne pesto.
[292:44.36]I don't know.
[292:47.66]um I think this is a uh like the satanists at FromSoftware made this one and I think there's an like an invisible wall right at the beginning this is
[293:07.54]This Satanist.
[293:09.22]Yeah, like every single time like a gamer gets aggravated and you like fuck Malenia fucking fucking hate Malenia like that energy exits your soul goes through the game through the cords of the internet goes into Miyazaki.
[293:22.13]They're all plugged into him and he's like in his chamber.
[293:24.45]Oh, yes.
[293:26.17]Oh, yeah.
[293:28.77]That is like they breathe it out of like a cone or something.
[293:35.42]Yeah, like that.
[293:43.79]Drop under the elevator, people are saying.
[293:45.21]I think that's correct.
[293:46.75]We did that.
[293:47.81]We did do that.
[293:48.41]We did do that.
[293:49.51]Oh, hey, I found it.
[293:50.67]I found it.
[293:51.03]You didn't see this?
[293:52.41]It's right here.
[293:52.83]How did you not see this?
[293:53.43]We haven't been down here.
[293:54.07]There's no enemies here.
[293:55.63]We haven't been here.
[293:56.51]You haven't seen that?
[293:57.69]How did you not see that?
[294:00.39]Bro, I walked in here and I saw it immediately.
[294:02.37]I don't understand how you didn't see that.
[294:04.21]Satanists.
[294:10.59]Well, that's how they get you.
[294:12.39]Satan was an angel himself.
[294:16.29]And then you're in.
[294:18.75]Then they got you.
[294:19.97]Then we have to drop down to get back to the door.
[294:22.42]Yeah.
[294:27.20]Did you drop?
[294:28.44]Yeah.
[294:31.31]Making sure.
[294:44.46]Alright.
[294:45.20]You ready to kill this boss in 10 seconds?
[294:47.03]Ready.
[294:47.55]Ready to kill this boss with Wild Strike.
[294:50.53]While you go... Should be fun.
[295:00.21]Why is this already dead?
[295:15.31]I don't like that tone that you had.
[295:34.87]nice okay that is a lot legendary graven which is clean rod helm of what well I got the same one as you like exactly intelligence arcane that's a lot of stats it's a lot but I don't really want it meaning that's what I'm saying like a lot of the stuff I'm getting is in arc mind all the stuff that I don't want
[296:01.94]Where's the big boy smasher?
[296:11.93]Alright.
[296:13.79]We could keep going to the... The thing at the archery was insane.
[296:20.55]We should probably upgrade our stuff.
[296:24.31]Don't you think?
[296:26.63]I don't know what we need to upgrade.
[296:28.39]Do you want to run to the blacksmith guy again?
[296:33.73]I would like to upgrade the frenzy flame thing.
[296:36.33]It's pretty much the thing I'm using.
[296:38.37]Warpo.
[296:42.01]We got to get to EG.
[296:43.37]Didn't work.
[296:50.39]Okay.
[296:50.95]Then we got to go fight this giant salamander.
[296:52.73]That takes no damage.
[296:55.32]High vigor, damn.
[297:02.32]You actually want to fight this?
[297:06.20]Well, I mean, otherwise, I just hear you.
[297:08.38]I'm dead already.
[297:09.66]Never mind.
[297:10.52]This thing has like a million health.
[297:12.00]I don't think that, yeah, we're not going to be able to kill this.
[297:17.93]Yeah, no way.
[297:30.15]I got you.
[297:43.04]Actually, I'm going to level up.
[297:45.68]Yeah, fire is bad on it.
[297:47.92]Yeah, I can't level up because I died.
[297:52.70]I got it.
[297:53.10]Sorry.
[297:57.70]Sorry.
[297:58.10]Oh, you want to go get some ice cream?
[298:02.52]Let's do.
[298:02.98]Hmm.
[298:11.28]We could just run to the southern part.
[298:15.38]EG to upgrade.
[298:16.22]You want it to upgrade?
[298:17.04]I do.
[298:23.32]Yeah, Ray LaCarre is the way to go.
[298:26.10]But we don't have to do that.
[298:37.19]I...
[298:40.01]Play Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[298:41.01]Ster, have you ever played Five Nights at Freddy's?
[298:45.65]No.
[298:47.65]Could we do a stream where I just watch you?
[298:49.98]I just stream you playing Five Nights at Freddy's.
[298:53.14]We just kind of hang out.
[298:55.32]Sure.
[298:55.60]Alright, cool.
[298:57.22]It's an odd request, but I'd do it.
[299:02.40]I just get a bunch of snacks and shit, and you just play, and we just watch you play.
[299:07.09]I have never watched anyone play.
[299:08.95]I don't get it.
[299:09.87]I 100% don't understand Five Nights at Freddy's.
[299:13.97]So I guess it'd be like the raw deal.
[299:17.73]Yeah.
[299:21.23]Is there a preference for what's the good one?
[299:23.21]Are the VR ones good?
[299:25.81]The VR one actually was pretty fun from what I played of it.
[299:33.17]But Five Nights at Freddy's 2, I think, is probably the staple.
[299:37.35]That's, I think, the apex of the series for a lot of people.
[299:45.78]Raw.
[299:46.18]And then I'll just be chatting.
[299:50.54]I'll just laugh at you when you get jump scared.
[299:52.42]What's the dumbest game you've ever gotten, like, scared while playing?
[299:56.61]Like, the most scared you've been, but also, like, you really shouldn't have been.
[300:02.35]SCORN.
[300:04.07]Really?
[300:04.41]You were scared in SCORN?
[300:06.41]There was like, there was like three or four.
[300:07.65]Okay.
[300:08.01]So in SCORN, this weapon container comes out of the ground and I was not prepared for it.
[300:15.14]And I screamed and it hurt my whole body.
[300:22.20]I did not expect it to be so recent.
[300:27.09]Or, uh, yeah.
[300:28.49]Mine is a Quake 4.
[300:29.43]Hmm.
[300:31.50]The Quake 4 single player.
[300:32.78]There's a really dark area and it took me about an hour to walk through slowly at the end of this level.
[300:40.89]And if you like know the layout of what you're doing, it should take you about 30 seconds.
[300:46.71]I'm kind of a jumpy person though.
[300:49.05]Like I would say.
[300:50.01]So even things that aren't supposed to jump scare me, they kind of do if they're quick.
[301:00.17]I'm a badass for real.
[301:01.43]True.
[301:10.06]I mean, when Quake 4 came out, I was like 13 years old.
[301:12.84]Okay.
[301:21.06]Alright.
[301:21.40]Can I upgrade this?
[301:23.68]I am an old... So perhaps you'd like to do...
[301:29.34]Ooh, he sells cool stuff.
[301:31.18]There we go.
[301:32.70]Alright.
[301:33.04]Boom.
[301:35.82]Boom.
[301:37.16]What did that do?
[301:41.02]172 scaling now on this thing.
[301:43.71]Nice.
[301:45.05]Do you have a Smithing Stone five regular?
[301:50.05]I do not.
[301:50.45]I only have four.
[301:55.57]Yeah, that's what my club needs.
[302:00.26]Well, I am going to level up.
[302:11.46]Yeah, +2 is the max on the mod.
[302:13.55]Yep.
[302:20.75]Can I turn him off for a second?
[302:24.03]Me?
[302:25.67]Can I sit at the Grace?
[302:27.97]Yeah.
[302:28.13]Yeah.
[302:35.55]10,400.
[302:35.65]Shit.
[302:35.87]Shit, can I have, uh, do you have any crunchies?
[302:52.91]I need 400.
[302:53.23]I feel like this happens a lot to you.
[303:01.03]You're constantly taking my crunchies.
[303:04.77]Well, if you have extra crunchies, then you should be sharing them.
[303:10.52]I need to level so I can equip some stuff.
[303:21.63]Alright, now I'm going to be doing disgusting damage.
[303:30.34]Please don't accidentally shoot him.
[303:40.61]Let me take just a quick look.
[303:43.67]Some of the stuff I think might scale with faith.
[303:45.37]Whoa.
[303:51.71]+2 faith.
[303:53.16]A faith scaling.
[303:56.62]35 strength.
[303:57.02]Is that the only thing I have that scales with faith?
[304:19.47]This is a one-hander though, right?
[304:21.21]No, is it not?
[304:25.89]Anything can be a one-hander.
[304:27.23]It's true.
[304:36.50]I think that's the only good thing I have for Faith.
[304:43.90]thing skills is strength that's pretty damn good like I said a one-hander I well well okay our last playthrough I did a big slow two-hander I want to do that again yeah but you weren't casting magic yeah but I want to just be like I want to be a predominantly just spell caster oh follow me
[305:20.47]Isn't this exciting?
[305:23.22]We split that where you're going.
[305:24.46]We split that really well.
[305:25.72]I mean, we're going to carry a manner.
[305:28.42]No.
[305:31.02]Wait, actually exciting.
[305:32.56]I don't know where I'm going and you're going to lead the way.
[305:34.56]Yep.
[305:37.35]It could be literally anywhere.
[305:41.35]This whole wide open world.
[306:08.74]Yeah, can you frenzy this?
[306:11.60]Sure can.
[306:18.81]Easy.
[306:21.27]Uh, that's frost dump.
[306:40.39]Where are you taking me?
[306:42.63]On a date.
[306:44.39]Where are we going?
[306:47.23]Somewhere special.
[306:53.06]I need to look at the map.
[307:01.03]And they won't let me look at the map.
[307:03.19]I think it's this way.
[307:08.27]It's Applebee's.
[307:12.30]Oh, I love the riblets.
[307:15.80]I know this should lead us to the frenzied village where you can get your frenzy on.
[307:32.48]I think I'm wrong.
[307:33.54]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[307:35.14]It's a long, annoying path.
[307:36.75]This is correct, though.
[307:44.63]I don't remember the last time I've eaten in an Applebee's.
[307:46.35]I think it's been a very, very long time.
[307:55.29]It's been a long time.
[307:56.19]Yeah, been a long time for me.
[308:01.69]I think we go up here to the right, then we wrap around, then we're up on the high ground.
[308:06.03]There's just bears everywhere.
[308:09.56]Wow, a bear seed.
[308:10.88]Wow, another bear.
[308:11.86]Are you serious?
[308:12.46]There's more bears?
[308:14.12]There are a lot.
[308:17.56]What is the staple at Applebee's?
[308:19.32]What is the actual Applebee's staple?
[308:22.14]Oh, my fucking God.
[308:23.90]Don't, please.
[308:24.92]Oh, my God.
[308:25.90]I got fucking killed by the bear, apparently.
[308:29.08]Enough bears, dude.
[308:35.34]Stake of America, I think, is probably closer.
[308:37.74]I don't know.
[308:39.23]I don't know.
[308:41.07]Probably.
[308:41.69]I'm kind of forgetting.
[308:51.98]Well, let me look at the map.
[309:05.34]So what's, okay, Applebee's, Chili's, Friday's, what's another, that tier of sit-down restaurant, what's the best?
[309:19.63]What's the best?
[309:21.02]What's the best one of those?
[309:27.04]Definitively, which one is the best?
[309:31.99]Chili's?
[309:32.35]Dude, whichever one's closest.
[309:35.02]True.
[309:36.18]They're all about the same.
[309:37.22]I just remember being on a Friday's like one time.
[309:39.66]Not, I don't know.
[309:42.18]I mean, Fridays are alright, but I'd rather it be a Saturday.
[309:47.66]The Olive Garden?
[309:50.50]Is the Olive Garden on that tier?
[309:51.68]It is, right?
[309:53.42]Yeah, for sure.
[309:54.30]I would probably say Olive Garden.
[309:55.26]I'm going to say like Red Lobster and all that.
[310:03.81]I don't remember where this item actually is in here, but this is the place.
[310:07.70]Well, we'll find it eventually.
[310:09.18]Watch out for the gigantic axe.
[310:14.16]Ow, my face.
[310:18.40]That guy just did a Jerma scream.
[310:28.18]I just, I wanted to get this item because it might be the frenzy fire.
[310:31.50]Alright, I got the frenzy cookbook.
[310:34.76]This crab.
[310:38.16]I miss.
[310:38.52]I miss having wild strike already.
[310:42.48]Fucking God.
[310:45.20]Why do you have to be here?
[310:46.30]I just want to.
[310:46.74]I got the mask.
[311:00.69]Leave me alone.
[311:01.35]I want nothing to do with you.
[311:21.11]Such carnage.
[311:23.77]Okay.
[311:24.87]There is a giant over here still and I want to find the other frenzy spell.
[311:30.37]I think there is more up this hill.
[311:32.39]There's like a chest.
[311:42.00]Yeah, Olive Garden...
[311:44.07]I feel like Olive Garden's kind of a meme and people shit on it.
[311:49.06]Oh, Olive Garden.
[311:49.96]Oh, yeah.
[311:50.60]Oh, of course, Olive Garden.
[311:51.74]Oh, don't forget the breadsticks.
[311:53.02]No, but seriously, don't.
[311:53.72]They're good.
[311:54.60]That's a great thing to do.
[311:56.22]Soup salad and breadsticks actually is fucking pretty legit.
[312:02.48]You're not going to hear me talking shit about soup salad and breadsticks.
[312:04.62]You're just not.
[312:10.20]There.
[312:16.18]Fair, balanced, based, even.
[312:21.30]Now, the last time I ate at the Olive Garden, it's been an uncountable amount of years.
[312:27.56]I don't remember.
[312:28.32]I am... That doesn't mean I wouldn't eat it.
[312:33.30]Because it's the closest.
[312:34.76]There's a Chili's near here.
[312:36.40]So I'm team Chili's, just again, whichever is the closest.
[312:39.52]What just happened to me?
[312:41.82]Wait, you died?
[312:42.78]Oh, there was an invader here.
[312:48.67]I thought I had one hit.
[312:54.55]Yeah, he's... There definitely is something off with the fucking roll.
[312:59.48]I'm telling you.
[313:01.60]I'm not crazy.
[313:02.94]That was funny, though, because you went... It was almost a song.
[313:08.62]Yeah, like normally in between those, you'd be able to roll.
[313:14.52]Those are not like perfect roll catching doomsday swings.
[313:18.88]I just, yeah.
[313:21.04]There's something wrong.
[313:22.48]It's been wrong the whole game.
[313:25.54]I think it lets you roll a little bit earlier out of hitstun because it buffers it differently.
[313:34.87]but then actually you rolling earlier is like I do I don't know something there I do remember reading the change lock yeah it's not my fault it's Jerma's fault that's what your character did and then you died alright we need to warp up there I don't know what where you are I'm standing right on top of it oh I I it respawned me somewhere else because I don't know why oh I need to warp
[314:11.67]How come everyone's talking about vibes?
[314:16.09]I don't know.
[314:16.63]Because they're just all messed up right now.
[314:22.55]You got a problem with the vibes?
[314:30.75]Did I do something?
[314:31.61]It's me, isn't it?
[314:34.10]Are you... Where are you?
[314:37.50]I'm traveling down from the church.
[314:39.80]Didn't we just tell... Huh?
[314:43.25]Vibes are funky right now.
[314:44.76]Uh, Inquisitor, uh, whatever, that Inquisitor is here.
[314:53.82]We need to kill, we have to kill this Inquisitor.
[314:55.92]Yeah, I'm with you.
[315:05.45]Ah!
[315:05.61]We're good.
[315:08.29]Vibes are back.
[315:09.75]Vibes are good.
[315:11.88]I need to sit down at the bonfire because I have like, I have no HP.
[315:21.32]Okay.
[315:32.00]Okay.
[315:35.53]Let's continue.
[315:39.83]So what did you get from the town?
[315:43.02]I didn't finish looting it.
[315:44.12]I got a frenzied cookbook, but there's more stuff down there that I think I want to get.
[315:47.77]I think to our left over here.
[315:50.41]Hold up before we go back down.
[315:52.17]Yeah, this is the tower.
[315:53.61]This is I know there's something at the top of the tower and it makes you go.
[315:56.98]The top of the tower is the grab.
[315:59.32]Let's get it.
[316:02.16]I think you might have to come from yeah do not okay I don't know what I was doing I I don't I don't know what I was thinking I just like saw it and I thought I don't know you've been jumping around all game and I was like oh you're gonna probably jump off I don't know you've been jumping around all game and I'm like oh he probably is gonna jump with me I don't know nobody saw that from Vinny's stream that's fair and valid that I made you do it because I'm smarter than you
[316:31.36]welcome everybody from Vinesauce what's up playing some Elden Ring co-op randomizer with Diablo II loot and some of reforged it's a little messy but we are getting through it I mean what's a bowl of spaghetti if it's not all over your shirt okay are we I almost just died again you're following me

[317:05.06]You're following me.
[317:06.74]I am following you.
[317:07.42]Because when you choose where to go, it's off a cliff.
[317:18.32]But thanks to the raid.
[317:19.42]Welcome, everybody.

[317:25.70]Vibes restored.
[317:38.69]okay get on your horsey this is not affecting me at all it will when you get closer why do I feel like when I played before it was very very far away it was just a line of sight that's okay so that's weird I remember it being much much much I think there's a way worse angle you can come at it from
[318:22.79]Okay.
[318:24.07]Okay, you climb.
[318:24.99]I look at ancestral loot.
[318:33.48]Excuse me?
[318:34.02]There's somebody coming down the ladder.
[318:39.08]What?
[318:41.51]I'm coming.
[318:42.35]Somebody's coming down the ladder.
[318:43.79]Alright, me.
[318:56.73]Me.
[318:57.91]I'm ladder.
[319:04.57]You missed the chest.
[319:06.03]I'm killing these things first.
[319:13.22]God damn it!
[319:14.18]No!
[319:14.60]Yeah, I forgot it's not just an easy enemy.
[319:18.92]It's like this fucking thing.
[319:20.50]Whatever the hell.
[319:21.12]It's like rats and bugs.
[319:23.30]Alright.
[319:25.42]I thought it was going to be like the default shitty enemies, but it's like a bunch of rats and it's a huge flower.
[319:31.39]These vibes are way off.
[319:35.01]I was like, oh yeah, these guys die in one hit.
[319:36.71]They're so easy.
[319:37.39]Wait, that's right.
[319:38.21]It randomized everything.
[319:39.03]There's a giant flower up there.
[319:47.48]are you dead?
[319:48.74]no close it's still alive?
[320:09.20]it's got a lot of health
[320:14.84]What's going on up here?
[320:16.32]What's going on up here?
[320:17.66]God damn it.
[320:22.25]Shoot him!
[320:36.90]Oh my god.
[320:37.50]The fives are a bit off.
[320:51.79]wait we have a message saying that they're explaining something here elden reforge changes the combat system so attacks that you can jump over or duck under with the new duck are not iframed by dodges there should have been a tutorial at the beginning of the game for this but I don't think it worked because of the randomizer
[321:13.05]What?
[321:14.59]How do you even... How would you even know what those attacks are?
[321:17.48]I don't know.
[321:20.68]Basically, any attack you can duck or jump do not have iframes.
[321:30.15]I don't even... What are... Which ones are those?
[321:34.35]These vibes.
[321:35.49]Fucking... These vibes smell.
[321:39.37]They're rotting.
[321:48.73]My health bar is... I'm like a level 2 right now.
[322:07.98]You good?
[322:11.97]Alright.
[322:12.49]Alright, where is it?
[322:17.07]One floor down.
[322:17.77]You didn't have to come up here.
[322:18.81]I told you there's a chest.
[322:23.64]Nice.
[322:25.52]Yep.
[322:25.96]Yep.
[322:26.36]Yep.
[322:26.80]Yep.
[322:27.22]Yep.
[322:35.44]Vibes.
[322:36.24]Vibes.
[322:37.08]Vibes.
[322:37.64]Vibes.
[322:37.90]Vibes.
[322:41.43]I forgot what that whole castle is over there.
[322:44.61]Let's check it out.
[322:52.22]It's a bonfire.
[322:55.48]Oh, I bet you could.
[322:56.78]Oh, this must be a memory slot thing.
[323:09.82]Oh, you do the thing.
[323:12.16]We don't have it.
[323:13.30]We don't have the emote.
[323:15.16]Uh-oh, no emote.
[323:18.98]Bunch of losers showed up without the emote.
[323:21.81]Okay, so... Um, alright.
[323:24.45]I got some cool spells.
[323:27.07]I got some... Shoot, whatever it is.
[323:29.73]Let me see that helmet, though.
[323:36.17]What was it?
[323:38.25]There...
[323:40.95]Did I pick it up?
[323:42.89]Oh, it's a talisman.
[323:43.89]Yeah, never mind.
[323:52.45]There's another spell.
[323:56.64]Is it in that... They're in the town somewhere.
[323:59.88]There should be another one.
[324:00.70]I think... The giant was just kind of a pain in the ass.
[324:04.80]Maybe just run around and grab stuff.
[324:10.63]I'll meet you back in the town.
[324:15.51]You got it.
[324:22.05]Where were you jumping to?
[324:24.38]I don't know.
[324:26.18]See the vibes.
[324:27.12]Something's going on with the vibes tonight.
[324:29.54]I couldn't iframe on the jump.
[324:35.68]I can just normal Elden Ring.
[324:37.24]You can do that.
[324:37.86]That's fine.
[324:50.32]No vibe frames.
[324:53.00]It's true.
[324:57.99]OK, I actually have a health bar now.
[325:02.06]Should you eat pizza tonight?
[325:04.45]Well, that depends.
[325:05.99]Did you have pizza last night?
[325:08.09]If the answer is yes, is that pizza leftovers?
[325:11.09]If that answer is yes, then by all means, eat the leftovers.
[325:14.09]Make sure you don't waste any of that.
[325:15.31]You know, it's still good.
[325:17.09]If you've eaten a pizza yesterday, there's no leftovers, and you're ordering another pizza today, I would say probably not.
[325:23.36]I have a question about that.
[325:34.67]Um, you can put any toppings you want on a pizza.
[325:37.09]Yep.
[325:37.25]Like what a pizza is can really vary.
[325:40.21]Can we kill this giant before we do this?
[325:43.57]But the pizza you're ordering today is vastly different.
[325:49.03]We need to figure out the... Dude, we got to figure out the dodge thing.
[325:52.31]Because I can't dodge any moves.
[325:58.85]I have not been having that issue.
[326:01.67]You just got hit five times.
[326:03.08]We just watched it.
[326:05.02]I wasn't dodging, though.
[326:12.42]Like, okay.
[326:14.36]Give me... He's going to smack.
[326:17.70]And see, I... See, I... You got hit?
[326:21.04]He's going to smack.
[326:22.82]Yep.
[326:22.92]You got hit.
[326:28.72]Your vibes stink right now.
[326:30.63]Your vibes are awful right now.
[326:41.79]Alright.
[326:42.59]We need to try blocking.
[326:49.27]Alright.
[326:50.45]Can you are we going to figure this out or what?
[326:53.00]How the dodge works in this game?
[327:02.82]I guess.
[327:03.18]How do we figure that out?
[327:04.45]We have to find a default enemy and just try to swing like dodge through stuff.
[327:08.79]Okay.
[327:09.93]OK, this crab does like a really you'll do like the the slam.
[327:13.83]This thing is awful to test this on.
[327:17.21]No trust.
[327:19.37]Become slam you dodged.
[327:21.90]Didn't dodge that you should have done you.
[327:30.68]OK, hold on.
[327:36.54]He sucks.
[327:37.56]This guy sucks.
[327:39.57]I'm asleep.
[327:41.27]Dude, I've never seen that status effect.
[327:42.83]Alright, hold on.
[327:45.99]Let's test it.
[327:50.03]Yeah.
[327:50.91]Uh-uh.
[327:51.43]We got to figure this out, dude.
[327:52.23]There's no such thing as a dodge roll in this game.
[327:55.89]Can you do the other dodge?
[327:58.73]Where you just like the crouch weird dodge.
[328:01.21]Let's try it.
[328:04.77]No, you should have that.
[328:14.96]Come on, do the thing you just did.
[328:18.62]Another move.
[328:19.08]Alright, you try it.
[328:21.46]Alright, you ducked under that, but I couldn't duck under it.
[328:34.85]I think I was just lucky because I didn't... If that's the timing...
[328:48.04]Yeah, I can't dodge roll anything.
[328:50.38]Alright, so wait a minute.
[328:51.92]You mean to tell me that for 5 hours and 30 minutes, we have not been able to have iframes.
[328:57.68]When we thought we fixed a setting, we just haven't.
[329:00.66]Yeah.
[329:02.68]Yeah, this is undodgeable.
[329:07.26]I thought we fixed it.
[329:08.96]Oh.
[329:14.93]Everything just felt so wrong.
[329:16.83]Everything has felt so off the whole time and it's because we don't have a dodge roll anymore.
[329:23.65]We have to jump it?
[329:24.81]Alright, we'll try that.
[329:26.05]But how do you... I know that there was something in this mod and it might... Dude.
[329:34.81]What?
[329:35.21]That might be it.
[329:36.31]I remember that I think the classes have their own ways of dodging.
[329:43.76]uh did I get all the items I don't remember we don't have a class there's one more spell here right isn't there one more spell I know I'm gonna look it up you run around and vibe
[330:13.49]I think if you go up and then you go into those castle ramparts, you like jump on the castle, then like Vike invades you and you can get something.
[330:20.30]Oh.
[330:33.13]Yeah, I think it's because we have randomizer and we randomized the person in the tutorial.
[330:39.29]Right?
[330:39.53]Like, we should have gotten somebody that... We also kind of have an issue with the D2 loot.
[330:45.01]It was overriding.
[330:46.33]Kind of just all messed up.
[330:49.47]Oh, yeah.
[330:49.67]There was no bike.
[330:50.31]That was the Giza guy.
[330:51.65]Oh.
[330:55.72]Anything else up here?
[331:02.28]That spell is in a dung beetle.
[331:04.46]Hmm.
[331:04.60]Hmm.
[331:11.47]No, it's not the mod's fault.
[331:13.79]We have just a lot of shit turned on and I guess we didn't realize that we were overriding stuff with other stuff.
[331:21.72]That is really funny though that we've been operating essentially without a dodge roll this whole time.
[331:39.51]I mean, there are a lot of people saying that in the post that there's no iframes.
[331:45.64]They're not running any other mods and they don't know what the problem is.
[331:49.88]But also we're on an older version of the mod.
[331:53.61]And I don't know.
[331:54.27]It's alright.
[331:56.69]It's fine.
[331:57.15]We're having fun.
[332:02.37]Oh no, our modded sky room.
[332:18.84]Why the older version?
[332:19.88]Because the older version, Ster correct me if I'm wrong, but was compatible with D2 loot?
[332:25.92]Yeah, the D2 items have a compatibility patch and it only works with an older version of Reforged.
[332:35.62]But like these posts on the forum that are saying there's issues with the iframes are from like very recently.
[332:43.11]So I don't know.
[332:43.77]I don't know if we missed something in the classes or...
[332:48.90]But we kill things in two seconds anyways.
[332:52.13]It's like, yeah, it's not been that big of a problem, surprisingly, to not have dodge rolls.
[332:58.79]I think we just have expected them to work, and it's been confusing.
[333:02.83]A big thing that the mod also does is it changes a lot of hitboxes on attacks so that, like, the hitbox is exactly where the weapon is.
[333:11.93]So it might feel like dodge rolls are working because your character model is getting smaller and moving out of the way of it.
[333:17.53]Like, when a giant does, like, giant overhead slam on the ground, it's, like, a much smaller hitbox, and your roll is moving you.
[333:25.54]So, like, sometimes...
[333:28.28]It's working, which is why we probably haven't noticed it.
[333:33.72]Where's this?
[333:34.48]There's one more spell.
[333:35.50]Somebody said it's outside.
[333:36.52]There's like a pack of rats.
[333:37.98]Isn't that further away?
[333:45.33]Honestly, if you want to play Reforge, just play Reforge.
[333:47.85]It doesn't mix well with other mods.
[333:49.11]Stuff breaks.
[333:50.89]You should do randomizer plus DSL only.
[333:53.72]If you want to play Reforge, do that on its own.
[333:57.34]Pretty balanced take on it, I think.
[334:00.12]Yeah, we were really close to doing one or the other before the stream started, and then someone had some advice to get them to work a bit better, and it seemed to be working pretty well.
[334:08.88]We'd already spent a lot of time on it.
[334:14.06]Okay, let me remember.
[334:15.94]I've got to find this.
[334:20.29]Where is this pack?
[334:21.81]You know where this pack of rats is?
[334:25.52]Up the hill.
[334:25.80]The hill towards the chapel, but turn left and then find the dung beetle.
[334:31.26]You mean, like, over here?
[334:34.64]Like, up this way?
[334:36.44]Up the hill.
[334:40.18]Like, up here?
[334:42.90]What's the item?
[334:44.12]Another frenzy spell, apparently.
[334:46.24]Like, up here?
[334:47.35]Oh, up this way.
[334:47.85]Okay.
[334:55.78]Well, it was a fun attempt.
[334:59.08]I mean.
[335:00.42]Can't get everything to work perfectly every time.
[335:04.06]I really haven't even been rolling.
[335:05.68]I've just been wild striking.
[335:10.00]OK, poisoning through attacks.
[335:13.71]So where is this other spell?
[335:19.19]Up here.
[335:28.78]Looking for a pack of... It's not going to be rats.
[335:30.64]It'll be something else.
[335:35.78]In that little forest.
[335:36.84]I think over here.
[336:04.55]Is this supposed to be them?
[336:06.99]I guess.
[336:07.34]Alright, there's a lot of shit here.
[336:27.54]Oh my God, will you leave me the fuck alone?
[336:30.96]Miyazaki grows in power.
[336:35.94]Where's the... It's like the little dung beetle.
[336:42.42]There was one, like, up the path.
[336:45.07]This fucking tele... I swear to God, it's the worst enemy in the whole game.
[336:49.49]It just teleports.
[336:51.33]Okay, we're looking for a dung beetle.
[336:59.33]Wait, you mean that?
[337:00.89]I wish I could even look over here.
[337:02.95]I wish I could walk over here and attack, but I can't.
[337:06.79]You need a hand.
[337:09.80]I'm kind of looking, but you're having some issues.
[337:13.10]It's hard.
[337:13.70]People are saying, look, look, it's hard to look where there's a million fucking things shooting and fighting and teleporting on you.
[337:19.60]Look at this guy teleporting.
[337:23.54]It's instant transmission.
[337:24.82]It's despawn.
[337:25.40]You good?
[337:25.78]I don't even care.
[337:29.93]Just I-frame dodge it.
[337:32.01]Oh my god.
[337:33.33]You're not joking.
[337:34.39]I told you.
[337:34.85]That sucks.
[337:36.71]You can't dodge it and you can't get away from him.
[337:40.00]You can wild strike it.
[337:50.55]Refuse to get off the horse?
[337:52.65]Yeah, I don't want to get off the horse because there's no I-frame.
[337:55.21]There's no dodging.
[337:56.15]That thing would have killed me in two seconds.
[338:07.35]I don't have wild strikes like he does.
[338:08.83]I think the thing despawned.
[338:20.66]What thing I was looking for a dung beetle is apparently something over there.
[338:24.16]Yeah, I think there were dung beetles and then we startled with them.
[338:27.71]Yes.
[338:39.42]The beetle ran away when you started getting attacked.
[338:41.18]Well, I... It's hard to run after it.
[338:53.93]We'll never know.
[338:54.57]Alright, so what do you want to do?
[338:56.43]Do you want to... Do you want to keep playing this?
[338:58.77]Or do you want to, like, fix this and try it again some other time?
[339:01.37]What do you want to do?
[339:02.61]What do you want to do?
[339:04.39]I would rather play it correctly.
[339:08.41]I don't want to have no I don't want to have no dodge roll for the whole time we play this then in that case well I mean at that point wouldn't we have to make new characters completely oh to like start the game with the proper stuff we were supposed to have
[339:33.77]And then I think at that point like we probably have to ditch.
[339:42.48]I guess we'd just be ditching randomizer and then Diablo II loot would stay so we wouldn't have to restart.
[339:47.28]We would just have to.
[339:49.17]Turn off randomizer.
[339:52.61]Well.
[339:53.65]How about this?
[339:54.13]How about we let's restore the vibes?
[339:56.87]Let's go kill something fun.
[339:59.09]And then we will.
[340:00.63]Maybe we try to get another time.
[340:03.04]OK.
[340:04.06]We have to restore the vibes, though.
[340:06.04]We have to kill a boss.
[340:06.68]Have to restore the vibes.
[340:07.62]They have to be restored.
[340:12.54]Where is the most convenient to fight major boss that we have not done?
[340:18.12]I mean, we could just ram through.
[340:23.00]Oh, we did Godrick.
[340:27.92]Could run through the castle of Lucaria.
[340:31.64]Just sprint through the castle.
[340:34.53]Is it easier to sprint through?
[340:36.59]Carry a manor if we just ran to where Loretta is.
[340:39.11]Yeah, let's do that.
[340:40.93]Let's get the vibes back.
[340:44.33]We have to get them back.
[340:54.18]I tried to click it.
[340:54.82]It didn't work.
[341:06.29]Reforged adds Sekiro-style timed blocks.
[341:11.40]It does?
[341:11.92]Ster, did you know that?
[341:18.96]No.
[341:23.14]Here, let me read you a couple of important things.
[341:26.82]We're playing this completely wrong for almost six hours.
[341:32.01]Removed the instant input buffer for rolls on most player stagger animations.
[341:36.81]That's why we're like... I think it was more that the rolls don't have iframes.
[341:43.06]Um...
[341:52.96]Where would it say any of this?
[341:55.08]I'm looking at the... Deflects are powerful tined blocks that give more skill and power to blocking.
[342:05.24]Holy shit.
[342:07.48]Alright, we gotta restore these vibes, man.
[342:10.14]They're hanging by a thread right now.
[342:11.56]I need them restored.
[342:26.67]didn't read well I didn't hold up hold up hold up I got it I'm telling you I've read a lot of it I didn't read very specifically dodge the whole mechanic of all souls games we thought like we could do it better the hubris uh blocking updated let me find the important bits we're gonna get these vibes back man we're gonna kill something
[342:57.30]You recover from block animations a lot quicker, so you can act more quickly out of them.
[343:00.90]Deflect.
[343:01.60]Blocking an enemy attack within the first few frames of a weapon's block animation will perform a deflect.
[343:11.87]Is this like some... Are we just drinking the copium, or are we just bad?
[343:16.24]Like, is there actually no iframes, or are we just awful?
[343:19.56]I don't think we're bad, because we... I need to figure... We haven't been...
[343:26.38]I need to know.
[343:27.44]We've been doing fine.
[343:35.65]Yeah, this page doesn't say anything about dodge rolls.
[343:38.19]It just says there is a there is a timed block mechanic.
[343:46.33]And then everything else.
[343:47.45]Alright, well, we're going to restore the vibes.
[343:48.91]We're going to kill a boss.
[343:49.81]We're going to say nice and then.
[343:51.63]Maybe we'll figure it out.
[343:53.88]We'll come back and try it again with the vibes restored, which I don't.
[343:57.74]I mean, I don't know.
[343:59.78]We'll see.
[344:03.34]We'll see.
[344:10.22]Teleporting to.
[344:11.04]Where?
[344:16.15]Let's do how we were going to do carry a manor.
[344:19.17]Yes.
[344:26.78]We didn't delete the right files for randomizer compatibility.
[344:30.08]I don't know.
[344:36.50]Hey, sometimes you try to do a bunch of mods and it goes great.
[344:39.22]Sometimes you do a bunch of mods and you can no longer iframe.
[344:41.98]Okay.
[344:45.75]That's just the way it is.
[344:46.45]Can we try one thing real quick?
[344:49.17]What do you want to do?
[344:54.53]Give me a second.
[344:55.67]I got to get my like cheat sheet open of what the menus do.
[345:00.77]Again, I don't know where they went.
[345:10.78]I sit here at bonfire.
[345:14.66]Are we going to change like a setting?
[345:17.02]Yeah.
[345:18.56]Top one event text.
[345:24.82]Someone was saying this earlier.
[345:25.86]Actually, this might be what it was.
[345:27.42]Normal mode is supposed to have normal dodge rolls, but I crashed earlier.
[345:32.35]And when I came back, there's a possibility that it reverted.
[345:37.03]So we did the top one down two.
[345:40.81]No, no, no.
[345:41.77]Wait.
[345:42.15]Okay.
[345:42.45]Reset.
[345:43.11]I lost my train of thought.
[345:44.50]Go way back to the beginning.
[345:45.94]Okay.
[345:46.38]Top one.
[345:48.14]Top one.
[345:51.18]Okay.
[345:51.62]Two down.
[345:53.78]Yeah.
[345:55.98]That's such a jump scare.
[346:05.89]So what did that do?
[346:08.67]That set it to normal Elden Ring difficulty.
[346:13.35]Which says by default, normal difficulty mode is enabled.
[346:16.65]This difficulty mode... Well, the other difficulties, like the higher and weirder difficulties, start changing how many eye frames you have on dodges.
[346:25.02]Alright, well, let's go kill a boss.
[346:32.08]and I might have accidentally turned one of them on earlier and game crashing might have brought it back okay how you doing I have one more thing I I want to get to the bottom of this before the stream ends do you want to go or do you want to alright fix it let's go
[347:00.71]I'm sorry.
[347:01.55]Sitting at the... I'm sitting down.
[347:04.85]I'm getting the picture.
[347:08.26]The picture?
[347:09.78]Yeah, I'm getting the picture.
[347:10.86]Because we definitely accidentally goofed around with these and killed ourselves a few times, which meant... We did.
[347:21.37]We activated something we shouldn't have.
[347:23.49]Oh, goddammit.
[347:26.05]Um...
[347:37.56]You good?
[347:38.94]I'm transcribing.
[347:51.50]Top one.
[347:53.84]Bottom one.
[347:54.56]Okay.
[347:57.58]for every single one of these yeah open them and then choose no choose no yeah it's turning all of the special weirdo options off if any of them were accidentally on because some of these there's like a shura mode and it's like hey this decreases iframes by like half and it's hard mode okay so like some of them might have been on oh okay
[348:29.27]Okay, let's go.
[348:30.05]And they're all showing up like that for chat because of how many mods are enabled.
[348:40.31]Yeah, we got too much stuff going on.
[348:43.21]Look, the vibes are going to be fine.
[348:45.30]The vibes are like, I can tell that you're about to like, I'm going to get a really bad stream rating after this by you.
[348:54.56]I'm going to be the one DMing you on Twitter.
[348:57.00]Oh, man.
[349:00.43]Ster was supposed to be the mod guy.
[349:03.63]And Ster didn't do his mod due diligence.
[349:06.25]He's never going to trust me ever again.
[349:08.01]Like, hey, you want to play this game?
[349:09.31]I got this cool mod with it.
[349:10.51]No!
[349:13.29]Ster said, no, no, no.
[349:14.49]Sit back and relax, Jeremiah.
[349:15.95]I got it.
[349:16.65]I am going to take care of all the mods.
[349:19.21]That's exactly what I did.
[349:22.22]I relaxed.
[349:24.26]I didn't... You got these cool Diablo items.
[349:28.22]No, it is cool.
[349:30.24]Wait, iframes?
[349:31.02]Do we have them?
[349:32.68]Let's find out.
[349:39.91]Oh, let's find like a normie enemy again.
[349:42.43]Why'd the music change?
[349:45.89]Crab.
[349:48.45]That's like a scarlet rock crab now.
[349:52.60]Alright, and...
[350:00.63]My parents trying to unstuck the car on a road trip.
[350:05.99]Now you're just spinning the tires.
[350:07.15]You're spinning the tires.
[350:08.07]This guy.
[350:09.09]This guy.
[350:09.39]This normal ass good dude right here.
[350:10.97]I wanted to pour a cup of warm water behind the tire.
[350:14.37]Alright.
[350:15.27]Normal ass enemy.
[350:20.26]Your roll hurt him because whatever item you have that does that.
[350:24.58]You guys swing so slow.
[350:27.64]Swing at me.
[350:31.52]I didn't even hit the button.
[350:36.98]He swings so... This is not a... No, just kill that one.
[350:40.14]I'll try it on this one.
[350:41.75]Okay.
[350:45.67]I mean, they all swing so... Whatever.
[350:47.67]There's a torch guy over here.
[350:48.89]Let's get torch guy.
[350:56.62]Okay.
[350:57.18]Torch guy.
[350:58.82]Oh, this guy's aggroed.
[351:00.04]Yep.
[351:01.06]That's perfect.
[351:02.78]I don't know if it worked.
[351:08.51]But he's got more got swings.
[351:12.65]Dude, get these fucking pants off.
[351:15.65]These pants are ruining everything.
[351:18.33]I'm bumping him and we can't even tell.
[351:20.05]Okay, try it again.
[351:20.83]No, didn't work.
[351:28.23]Nope.
[351:31.58]There are no iframes.
[351:38.25]Nope.
[351:39.11]Yeah.
[351:41.49]Just kill him.
[351:43.35]Let's go get these fucking vibes.
[351:45.37]Restore the vibes.
[351:46.39]Let's go.
[351:46.83]Oh, nice.
[351:49.75]Like this giant.
[351:51.19]Take all your frustration out on this guy's ankles.
[351:54.23]He'll never play basketball again.
[352:04.01]I don't know.
[352:04.41]I've... Legendary.
[352:17.37]Oh, that guy did drop a legendary.
[352:19.31]Holy shit.
[352:25.51]Vibes back.
[352:27.25]Legendary Godslayer's Leather Boots of the Gravy.
[352:44.11]Alright, let's go kill whatever boss is in here.
[352:45.89]Vibe's gotta get back.
[352:46.83]I know we're saying that word a lot, but look.
[352:49.95]We've been dealing with a lot today.
[352:56.51]Oh.
[352:58.13]It's just too much.
[353:03.28]Follow me.
[353:05.12]Hold on.
[353:11.66]Don't get hit by this bear.
[353:17.79]Oh no, another bear.
[353:25.67]Don't get hit by this lobster.
[353:26.71]Dude, how are you?
[353:28.67]I was going to say, what are you thinking?
[353:31.51]You can't get through that.
[353:32.81]I can't.
[353:36.77]Did you make it?
[353:37.27]No.
[353:42.98]We can't even get through.
[353:44.27]That's like the perfect.
[353:48.07]Let's get these vibes back.
[353:49.11]Yeah, we have to get.
[353:51.53]Alright, we're getting up there.
[353:53.65]Just one frenzy flame.
[353:54.81]You know what I'm saying?
[353:56.37]One frenzy flame will be alright.
[353:58.23]Well, then we'll get the vibes back.
[354:02.07]Sit down.
[354:02.83]Sit down.
[354:03.37]Everything's going to be alright.
[354:04.74]Everybody relax.
[354:09.37]Everybody just calm down.
[354:10.81]Everyone's freaking out, but everything's fine.
[354:17.15]Just kill everything.
[354:29.82]That does a lot of damage.
[354:38.36]find wild strikes here okay oh god dude are you oh shit oh shit please don't kill me please don't kill me
[355:09.89]What is he doing?
[355:15.67]No.
[355:22.48]Alright.
[355:22.72]Lobster is dead.

[356:13.95]What does this do?
[356:15.74]I don't want to be the reason for the worst stream of the year.
[356:19.92]You respawn them all when you rest it.
[356:21.84]Yeah, well, look who's going to be able to kill them.
[356:27.45]Now, hey, worst stream of the year is not a category this year, by the way.
[356:31.15]Oh, I'm removing it.
[356:34.87]Oh, I forgot I can't dodge.
[356:56.37]you just try to run I I mean just good luck good luck okay don't respawn the enemies again
[357:17.23]I can't believe we've been playing for six hours without a fucking iframe.
[357:23.57]No wonder my ass has been itchy.
[357:25.99]I've been like, man, my fucking ass is like, something's pissing me off today.
[357:30.33]Something's pissing me off, and it was this.
[357:32.23]Oh my god, dude.
[357:34.43]I don't know why.
[357:36.79]It makes me wonder why I rolled there, because I can't roll.
[357:41.56]Why is there a roll button?
[357:43.20]Hey, mod, why is there a roll button?
[357:46.34]It's not the mod's fault.
[357:47.42]It's not the mod's fault.
[357:48.32]It's your fault.
[357:50.66]It's my fault.
[357:53.52]Alright, I made it up.
[357:59.36]I made it up.
[357:59.78]I made it across.
[358:02.36]I made it up.
[358:08.34]Now, contrary to popular belief, I've actually been having kind of fun.
[358:12.85]I've actually been having a good time.
[358:19.51]By the way, I'm going to sit down at the bonfire.
[358:22.67]Okay, do it.
[358:31.03]I am ready to fight the boss.
[358:34.33]I know we're coming up here to fight this boss to fix the vibes.
[358:42.13]I feel like the vibe has got worse.
[358:45.71]They can be redeemed if you come up here.
[358:51.02]I'm telling you they can be redeemed.
[358:52.02]I'm here.
[358:55.04]Okay.
[358:56.11]We've sat down.
[358:56.55]I'm ready to wild strike.
[358:57.71]Yep.
[358:58.89]Here, get this tree of savior.
[359:08.32]I mean, that's pretty good.
[359:09.42]I don't know.
[359:17.86]Is this the right way?
[359:18.42]Yeah, it's the right way.
[359:19.12]Okay.
[359:21.48]I'm ready to restore them.
[359:32.67]Very good.
[359:35.05]Very good.
[359:35.53]Very good.
[359:36.07]Very good.
[359:36.69]Watch out.
[359:37.21]Misbegotten.
[359:38.47]Uh-oh.
[359:41.15]Oh, wait.
[359:41.57]Hey.
[359:47.52]I can do that too.
[359:53.47]Doing a bit of that in real life.
[360:07.17]Oh yeah, you don't know what it is.
[360:08.41]Don't look up there.
[360:10.77]I never look at that.
[360:11.93]God, the vibes are dead.
[360:15.20]Not quite.
[360:18.21]How about this for vibes?
[360:34.66]That hurt.
[360:45.16]Oh yeah, I can't dodge it.
[360:47.16]That's a pretty good challenge run.
[360:56.01]Looks like our strength cred's going up.
[360:58.61]I don't know how we dodge these attacks.
[361:07.05]Try that thing.
[361:10.25]Duck.
[361:16.77]He should deflect?
[361:18.99]I don't think I even own a shield.
[361:33.71]I'm gonna die.
[361:46.24]Block with your axe?
[361:52.85]Whoops.
[362:03.87]That's going to blow up the whole area.
[362:05.07]No!
[362:13.34]Come on, we got to bring the vibes back.
[362:16.48]I've heard I've heard these vines need to come back oh I'm dead good luck
[362:44.82]What am I doing?
[362:45.66]Ster, only you can restore them.
[362:49.26]Oh, for the guild.
[362:51.58]No!
[362:52.44]He did four!
[362:53.12]Hey, can you play the Giga Chad music?
[363:04.19]Just so I feel better.
[363:09.65]No, don't play that.
[363:10.47]Oh.
[363:17.42]Is it last Grace site?
[363:18.52]Are we doing it again?
[363:21.53]We're doing it one more time.
[363:26.23]No, we're not.
[363:28.69]Alright, see you later.
[363:29.57]Come on, it's challenge run Placidusax, no dodge.
[363:33.56]I'll see you later.
[363:35.12]Hit me up this week if you want to do something.
[363:38.44]Alright, I'll find something to do and I will ask you to install some no iframe dodge rolls.
[363:44.56]Alright, I'm up here and I'm ready to go in for one more dumb attempt.
[363:49.62]Dumb attempt?
[363:50.76]What makes this attempt dumb?
[363:53.32]The fact that we're doing it in the first place again.
[363:55.89]It is pretty dumb because I'm like at the bonfire and you've started.
[363:58.87]Oh, I thought you were... Okay.
[364:01.71]I thought you were serious that you were done.
[364:03.33]I'm going to try the deflect thing.
[364:12.67]I did do it once, but it still ate all my stamina.
[364:16.01]But I didn't take any health damage.
[364:17.31]I mean, it's no.
[364:35.72]I'm glad I may challenge the boss area now.
[364:37.68]Come on, get these out of here.
[364:42.87]Your L2 is better than Frenzy.
[364:44.49]This thing doesn't do very much damage.
[364:52.08]I mean, I... My whole computer just crashed.
[364:56.50]Okay, my Elden Ring crashed, but it's still up on my stream.
[365:02.73]That's fun.
[365:04.19]How... There's nothing on my screen.
[365:09.24]Elden Ring is crashed right now, but I can look over at the OBS preview and see you fighting.
[365:16.26]Well, you know what they say.
[365:20.14]How do you dodge fire?
[365:23.00]Is what they say.
[365:23.72]It's alright.
[365:33.75]It was worth an attempt.
[365:34.61]Look, I had fun.
[365:35.15]I had fun.
[365:42.28]Hey, when you install a bunch of random mods, and you get in, and sometimes, sometimes they don't work well together, sometimes they get screwed up, sometimes there's no tutorial, because we broke it by deleting the tutorial, by having something happen in the randomizer, and then we just, you know, the vibes get a little fucked up.
[365:58.93]Sometimes?
[365:59.79]Sometimes?
[366:02.19]Sometimes.
[366:11.44]I've got this.
[366:12.00]Don't even worry about it.
[366:13.84]Five and a half hours went by and you didn't notice?
[366:15.62]Oh, no, we did.
[366:16.38]I just think that we both... I think we both thought that it was not possible.
[366:20.06]Like, as streamers, we're so used to being gaslit that, like... I brought it up at least a dozen times, and we were just like, no, wait, maybe I just, like, stink at this game.
[366:30.54]Yeah.
[366:37.33]I just... Honestly...
[366:43.13]I had fun.
[366:44.37]It was fun.
[366:47.09]It was worth doing.
[366:47.77]I think it was worth it.
[366:53.21]Yeah, we got to the point where I think once you get past early game, you need to start being able to dodge things.
[366:59.48]Well, it's alright.
[367:01.70]It's all good.
[367:04.12]It was definitely worth doing.
[367:07.58]Hey, seamless co-op mod worked pretty flawlessly, didn't it?
[367:12.44]yeah vibes some toilet vibes but you know whatever it's alright they all look sometimes you get toilet vibes but we're good everything's are you good how do you feel you feel I'm good yeah we're good everything's fine I mean we we had just played like
[367:34.23]I don't know how many hours of Elden Ring the week prior.
[367:37.45]I just want more Elden Ring.
[367:38.88]That's why we tried some new stuff.
[367:42.14]So we did some new stuff and I had fun because I wanted to play more Elden Ring.
[367:45.18]I don't think there's a problem with that.
[367:48.48]There's no problem with that.
[367:49.80]But it's bedtime.
[367:50.67]It's like almost 2am here.
[367:52.57]Either way.
[367:54.61]Thanks, Ster.
[367:55.11]Thanks for playing.
[367:55.87]Good to see you.
[367:56.75]I'm sure I'll see you again soon.
[367:57.95]Have a great night.
[367:58.81]Thank you for hanging out.
[368:00.79]Take care.
[368:01.37]See you soon, dude.
[368:02.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[368:05.46]That was Ster, and that was Elden Ring, and that was mods.
[368:18.91]Seamless Call for Skyrim would be phenomenal.
[368:22.25]Maybe.
[368:22.61]Hey, we were just checking it out.
[368:27.75]We did have, okay, we're coming off, you gotta remember, we're coming off like the ultimate high of last week playing and becoming Elden Lord.
[368:37.45]That's just like, you know what, let's just put some more stuff on and see what happens.
[368:41.19]The vibe's got a little fucked up.
[368:43.45]You know, whatever.
[368:45.55]That's all good.
[368:50.17]Is your PC okay?
[368:51.19]Yeah, I can change scenes.
[368:54.35]It's just Elden Ring is just not on my monitor.
[368:57.41]Just like not here.
[368:59.89]I can change scenes in OBS.
[369:05.18]Maybe try something like randomizer and double bosses or something.
[369:10.54]Are you making it?
[369:11.06]You're making it sound bad.
[369:13.16]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[369:15.99]I had a good time.
[369:17.39]All that matters is me and Stuart talked about like fucking bugs and stuff.
[369:19.87]Who cares?
[369:26.97]Thanks for sticking around regardless.
[369:30.66]The next time you see me will be on Wednesday.
[369:35.22]And Wednesday we are going to do... Hmm.
[369:41.30]Wouldn't you like to know?
[369:43.67]We'll see.
[369:49.13]I'll figure out a game.
[369:49.97]Maybe... Maybe the Hitman stuff.
[369:53.93]Kind of wanted to do it.
[369:56.12]Maybe the Hitman stuff.
[369:58.88]If not that, then we'll see.
[370:03.98]That'll be a decision for Tuesday night.
[370:11.28]Oh, let me say this too.
[370:13.38]I said that worst stream of the year is not going to be a category this year.
[370:17.73]I said that specifically because it's kind of to prevent, because I know I told you guys that a lot of the streams this year are going to be more chill, slowed down a lot.
[370:29.00]And it's kind of a way to prevent people to come into like a chill stream and go, oh, this is boring.
[370:33.80]Worst stream of the year, 2023, right?
[370:35.09]Because I feel like that's definitely possible.
[370:39.33]Because if I'm going to be doing more just chill, kind of slower streams, then I think it kind of takes that out of the equation.
[370:50.88]Because otherwise it would be like looking over here, Picross again?
[370:54.04]Got a lot of fucking nominations for that category this year.
[370:57.42]So I don't think I'd rather just not have it be there.
[371:06.57]Otherwise it might be a large category.
[371:16.99]But yeah.
[371:17.88]Thanks for watching.
[371:18.76]Ellen Ring with Ster.
[371:19.82]Ster is awesome.
[371:21.02]Give it up for Ster.
[371:25.66]Take care of yourselves.
[371:28.70]Have a great night.
[371:29.18]I'll see you Wednesday.
[371:32.77]Wednesday.
[371:33.55]You know the time.
[371:34.91]6 p.m.
[371:36.67]Pacific.
[371:37.11]It's gonna be fun.
[371:47.73]Do you have an email?
[371:49.97]Uh, you, if you, if anybody needs to, wants to contact me for any, if it's for business purposes, I don't really.
[371:56.25]Yeah, it's the evolved one.
[372:00.91]The evolved email that's on my Twitter is, but that's for business stuff.
[372:08.58]So if you like send a message of this, it's probably not going to get, um, it might get filtered or something.
[372:14.76]It's mostly for business stuff.
[372:17.73]But I don't really do anything else.
