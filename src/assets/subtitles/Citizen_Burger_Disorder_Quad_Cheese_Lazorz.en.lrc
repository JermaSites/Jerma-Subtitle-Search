[00:07.54]Oh dear.
[00:09.46]I'm afraid there are buns and burgers coming out of your butt.
[00:16.87]You really are the sandwich.
[00:20.51]You can never let go of E. Star has figured out how to close the restaurant down.
[00:26.22]How do you do that?
[00:29.26]Oh, he's blocking the people?
[00:30.64]Yeah.
[00:32.12]He's just closing the restaurant.
[00:34.38]They're just, like, bumping into the little shrubbery blocks.
[00:37.97]Oh, this is gonna get bad.
[00:38.99]This is gonna get to a point where this is gonna be stuffed in here.
[00:42.79]And, okay, they're becoming one.
[00:44.45]Yes.
[00:45.67]They are becoming one person.
[00:46.81]They are fusing into one.
[00:50.22]Oh, did you see that really mad face?
[00:51.78]They're using their combined strength to push the blocks forward.
[00:55.96]We need more blocks.
[00:57.62]Elf!
[00:57.94]Elf!
[00:58.71]Elf!
[00:58.95]That's perfect.
[01:02.81]They're not gonna get an hour store.
[01:06.41]This restaurant is closed.

[01:19.04]I'm blocking him.
[01:19.68]I'm blocking him with a block.
[01:20.82]I'm pulling him backwards.
[01:22.99]He's like, what are you doing?
[01:23.83]Please, I just want a burger!
[01:26.29]No, no, don't let him in.
[01:28.89]Blocking him.
[01:29.71]Get him out.
[01:31.23]Oh, wow.
[01:32.37]He just got catapulted to the other side of the room.
[01:35.43]Table three wants a double cheeseburger, two patties, two pieces of cheese, lettuce, and an extra little bun like a Big Mac kind of in the middle.
[01:45.46]That's what he wants.

[02:39.79]Look it, I got like the cash.
[02:43.10]The money maker.
[02:44.04]Is that what we've been putting out front this whole time?
[02:46.12]Those are bricks of money.
[02:49.18]The green things.
[02:50.40]We've been giving them our monies.
[02:52.85]Hey, new game.
[02:54.93]New game.
[02:56.27]Can we fit every single thing in the sink?
[02:59.88]How much food can we fit in the sink?
[03:01.20]Oh, I exited because I thought you meant, like, that kind of new game.
[03:03.98]No, I mean, like, how much food can we actually physically put in?
[03:06.08]Oh, I just, I quit the game because I thought you meant, like, new game.
[03:10.00]Oh, new game.
[03:10.58]Alright, left.
[03:12.23]Alright, now, the whole, we're gonna do, like, an earthquake test.
[03:14.67]Everybody get in the bathroom and Star, try to break the game.
[03:19.07]I can do that immediately.
[03:21.01]Alright, wait, no, we all have to be in the bathroom.
[03:22.79]We all have to, like, go down together.
[03:24.95]We don't have all the ingredients in the sink yet.
[03:26.57]Just gonna get in this corner.
[03:27.92]It's okay.
[03:30.10]Just get in like a big group hug.
[03:31.88]Oh, it's already begun.
[03:33.16]The Earth is shaking.
[03:35.02]Is the Earth shaking?
[03:36.00]Yeah.
[03:36.34]I crashed.
[03:37.72]Oh, I'm fine.
[03:38.70]That was like a... That's pretty lame.
[03:41.26]That was like a small... Okay, well then everybody at once jam on four through zero on your numbers.
[03:48.54]What do you mean?
[03:49.70]Is there too much tomatoes?
[03:50.58]Oh, dear.
[03:51.70]Tomatoes, onions, pickles, relish.
[03:56.79]Oh my gosh.
[03:58.01]Oh no, the frame lag.
[04:02.09]I gotta leave.
[04:03.09]I gotta get out of there.
[04:04.37]I gotta get out of there.
[04:06.99]Who tipped it over?
[04:08.37]We have like five people trying to snag on it at one time.
[04:11.73]Is one of the patties sideways for anybody else?
[04:14.97]Yes.
[04:17.06]This is the new masterpiece.
[04:20.28]We need some bacon on there too.
[04:21.56]In between or it's a segmented.
[04:24.74]Yeah.
[04:25.98]Who's over here with the cheese in the corner?
[04:28.06]I'm the master of the cheese.
[04:29.99]Alright.
[04:32.55]I'm preparing some bacon.
[04:33.67]That's my cheese.
[04:35.91]It's fighting over who gets it.
[04:37.19]Keep going back.
[04:40.41]Dude, this is seriously like we're shooting cheese laces at each other.
[04:47.53]What is going on?
[04:48.97]Can you go back in?
[04:49.93]I want to be cool, too.
[04:51.41]Alright.
[04:52.11]What happens if one of you guys tries to take the cheese laser out of our hands?
[04:56.35]Can you do it?
[04:57.45]Can it be done?
[04:58.99]Who's got the cheese?
[05:00.76]Oh, somebody got it.
[05:03.50]Oh, my God.
[05:04.60]Quad cheese lasers.
[05:10.88]I feel like this is moving so fast it would just, like, cut you.
[05:14.66]Star, your arms are, like, ten feet in front of you.
[05:17.84]Yeah.
[05:19.64]Everybody's hands are, like, twenty feet in front of them.
[05:24.79]Cheese lasers!
[05:28.23]Alright, I dropped the cheese.
[05:35.59]I dropped the cheese.
[05:36.75]I dropped the cheese too.
[05:37.59]Somebody's under the ground.
[05:38.35]Where did this come from?
[05:41.73]Where did the rats come from?
[05:43.97]Where did the rats come from?
[05:46.77]Hang on, my burger masterpiece is like halfway to complete.
[05:49.87]See you again.
[05:50.47]I fell through the ground again.
[05:52.63]Somebody else fell through with me.
[05:55.71]I see.
[05:56.09]Who else is falling?
[05:58.03]Me.
[06:01.12]Well, goodbye.
[06:02.20]Well...
[06:04.03]I guess my burger masterpiece was just getting too close to heavenly.
