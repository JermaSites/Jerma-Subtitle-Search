[ve:60.16.100]

[00:24.94]hello how's everybody doing yeah we're very on time today that's what happens when you spend two two hours troubleshooting uh mods and you get it uh to a point where wait oh he's talking hold on hold on hold on hold on three two one what are you doing hey how's it going how hey what are you doing
[00:48.08]People said they're shocked that we're actually on time today.
[00:51.07]But what I was saying is we spent like two hours getting this to work yesterday.
[00:55.69]So it's gonna work now.
[00:57.83]Yeah, it works now.
[00:58.65]We did it.
[01:00.11]We double checked.
[01:00.83]We crossed our T's.
[01:03.11]Everything's good.
[01:04.81]Your guy needs some pants.
[01:06.03]How'd you sleep?
[01:09.22]Not enough.
[01:10.75]No?
[01:11.17]Oh, that's right.
[01:12.28]You got up and went to the gym, right?
[01:14.52]I did.
[01:15.32]There was a bit of pumping this morning.
[01:17.22]I actually got back like an hour ago.
[01:19.98]Are you serious?
[01:23.66]Yeah.
[01:24.02]So you've got energy then.
[01:26.44]You're high energy then.
[01:27.40]It's the opposite because it's like a two-hour session of like, now I have no energy.
[01:33.95]But I'm energized for some Elden Ring.
[01:35.93]Okay.
[01:36.91]Well, so am I. So you ready?
[01:39.79]Yeah.
[01:41.55]What adventure lay forth before us on this eve?
[01:44.65]I don't know, but should we give a recap?
[01:49.19]Um, sure.
[01:50.09]Okay.
[01:51.96]Yeah, because I imagine people on my stream weren't watching until 2 a.m.
[01:54.94]last night in the, like, nine-hour Elden Ring session.
[01:57.44]That's really true.
[01:58.30]So a lot of people that left, here's a little bit of a recap.
[02:02.97]Ah!
[02:03.93]What the fuck?
[02:05.77]Ah!
[02:08.35]I disconnected.
[02:08.93]Oh, I'm back.
[02:11.31]I'll re-invite you.
[02:13.01]Okay.
[02:14.87]So that's pretty much all that happened yesterday.
[02:19.58]We did get up to Ray Lucaria.
[02:23.30]But if you don't know, we're doing randomizer.
[02:26.90]So, nothing is the way that it's supposed to be.
[02:31.34]You know, randomized.
[02:32.28]Every item is randomized and every enemy is randomized.
[02:35.56]We got stuck with... I don't even know the character's name.
[02:39.59]Placid... Deuce?
[02:41.23]Placid Deuce?
[02:41.91]What's the... Placid Deuce Axe is the boss in Reyna's... Placid Deuce Axe, the Queen of the Moon.
[02:48.91]Yes.
[02:50.13]He's the queen and he still has two phases and his second phase is Loretta.
[02:54.61]But him teleporting through walls was hard.
[02:57.17]We didn't beat it.
[02:58.51]So we gotta like farm up.
[03:00.40]You have like a deleted finger plus six weapon that I can't give you.
[03:05.45]So we're going to go around and do some catacombs or a little mini boss encounter stuff.
[03:11.63]Honestly, we skipped a lot.
[03:12.51]We basically ran straight to... The wall right now for us is... We're not going to reset.
[03:19.27]You want to know the wall for me?
[03:21.92]Is that your name is MeStrong and mine is MeSmart because I am the spellcaster.
[03:27.54]I have no spells.
[03:29.80]I have not found a spell.
[03:30.96]You've been casting spells, though.
[03:33.48]It is a weapon art.
[03:36.05]But I don't actually have a spell.
[03:37.47]But it still scales off of how intelligent you are.
[03:39.76]You have to be really smart to do it.
[03:41.12]I want you to be on my side that I haven't got any spells.
[03:44.24]Like, what if I had Crystal Laser Beam Supreme?
[03:46.28]What if, like, we go into Catacomb and we get Crystal Supreme?
[03:49.94]Yeah, but what's up with your title, by the way?
[03:53.24]What?
[03:54.27]Somebody.
[03:55.80]I didn't want to name drop.
[03:56.84]I thought it would be better to just write somebody.
[03:59.50]I wrote your name.
[04:01.02]I wrote Ster.
[04:02.02]Oh, you're going to name drop like that?
[04:04.21]Like, oh, you're just going to get all the viewers because always playing with Ster?
[04:08.65]You know, I will say years ago, that was actually a great idea.
[04:16.60]Those of you that don't know, back in the TF2 days, Ster was a big, big deal.
[04:23.86]And if you put Ster in your title... If it was like, oh, dude, TF2, man, TF2 is, like, such a fun game.
[04:28.19]Live commentary with Ster.
[04:30.25]Click this one.
[04:44.15]Yeah, a lot of the newer viewers here maybe don't know.
[04:47.19]Stirr was a TF2.
[04:50.11]Yeah.
[04:51.76]If you don't know, you're getting the way washed up Stirr.
[04:55.24]You don't even know.
[04:55.88]I don't think so.
[05:00.02]You don't know what you missed.
[05:02.12]I think this Stirr is pretty damn good.
[05:05.83]He's a good guy.
[05:06.91]Hey, all the Stirrs across the last 10 to 15 years have been good, I think.
[05:12.25]He doesn't afraid of anything.
[05:14.12]No.
[05:15.22]I like each Ster.
[05:21.65]But anyways.
[05:22.15]So, uh... Yeah, anyways.
[05:23.58]On to adventure.
[05:24.20]There's, um...
[05:26.27]Did we kill them?
[05:27.07]We did kill the Magma Wyrm at the tree.
[05:28.77]I know there's a down by the beach.
[05:30.67]There's like a sewer.
[05:32.87]We can go down.
[05:33.63]Oh, by the way, I played off stream and I know a lot of people are going to yell at me.
[05:37.18]Fucking piece of garbage.
[05:39.62]You human garbage.
[05:41.64]But there's a very hold on.
[05:43.86]I didn't do anything, though.
[05:49.20]Oh, it's one of these things.
[05:52.58]I just did.
[05:52.96]I just hit him across the game.
[05:54.00]Don't be afraid, man.
[05:56.96]Hey, hey, come on.
[05:58.14]Hey, you and me, we're starting a new arc right now.
[06:01.57]Here it is.
[06:01.87]I'd rather fight a boss.
[06:08.83]We ain't afraid.
[06:09.53]Look at that.
[06:10.01]Alright, that arc is over.
[06:15.47]We can go on to another one.
[06:16.45]That was like a pretty good one, I think.
[06:18.01]Okay.
[06:18.81]Adventure 2.
[06:21.90]I think we showed a lot of growth in that.
[06:25.23]Why is there a golden sheep?
[06:27.23]Is this rare?
[06:27.81]What is this?
[06:28.79]Oh, right.
[06:29.39]Oh, the lightning sheep.
[06:30.39]That's right.
[06:31.38]Okay, I thought there was like a randomizer thing.
[06:33.70]I also never found where you get that ability.
[06:38.54]I thought that... Yeah, I thought that was going to be runes or something.
[06:41.86]Oh, anyway.
[06:42.28]Okay, so people asked...
[06:45.21]I may have.
[06:46.93]I just killed... I killed the same enemy like 10 times to get some souls.
[06:52.05]Because I wanted to get... You have more levels than me.
[06:55.37]But you don't... I wanted to buy smithing stones.
[06:57.81]What level are you right now?
[07:01.86]I don't know.
[07:02.36]Why do you need to... I want to know what level you are right now.
[07:04.50]What level are you?
[07:04.88]And then I'll tell you immediately after.
[07:05.90]I'm 37.
[07:08.20]You are as old as I am.
[07:10.22]I'm 49.
[07:10.46]Okay.
[07:10.70]We evened out.
[07:13.58]That's like not bad.
[07:16.10]But anyways, I... I wanted to get stones because a big... A big... Yeah, I do it all the time.
[07:29.49]And I think I'm pretty good at making that joke.
[07:31.07]So I'm going to do it whenever I get an opportunity to.
[07:37.83]Let's help this boy.
[07:38.53]Uh...
[07:44.20]Wait, could I have duplicated shit, right?
[07:48.78]Yeah.
[07:49.66]Oh, my God.
[07:51.12]Alright.
[07:51.76]That's why people were saying not to do that.
[07:53.80]I remember it being, well, I don't know, this was a long time ago, like a year ago, when Randomizer was first out.
[07:59.43]All of my duplicating my shit was super glitched.
[08:03.41]Do we have another one of those, like, poison spitter teleporter pieces of shit on me?
[08:10.77]It's funny that you said that.
[08:11.65]I know exactly what that meant.
[08:16.84]And I'm poisoned.
[08:19.04]Sorry, just... Poison's not that bad.
[08:20.71]You just heal through it.
[08:30.01]Oh.
[08:33.21]What's that character's name?
[08:34.25]Royal... What's the character's name?
[08:38.31]The character?
[08:39.01]The thing that we just fought.
[08:39.75]That enemy?
[08:40.19]I have no idea.
[08:43.66]Royal Revenant.
[08:45.54]Royal Revenant.
[08:48.12]That sounds like a League of Legends item.
[08:53.84]I think this is random.
[08:56.46]Is it random?
[08:57.12]You get like an item in here too.
[08:59.66]I can't remember.
[09:00.96]Who knows?
[09:06.19]That felt like it lasted a long time.
[09:08.25]Alright, so what's in here?
[09:12.71]Oh, look at...
[09:21.27]I still haven't found a remembrance, so.
[09:26.47]Okay.
[09:28.47]I'm so sorry about this.
[09:30.79]I have to apologize immediately.
[09:33.03]But I need to be in a safe spot.
[09:35.28]Follow me.
[09:36.24]Because Otto needs to go outside.
[09:38.98]Follow me.
[09:41.98]So I can't really follow you.
[09:43.96]We're going to the shack.
[09:44.74]We're going straight up to the shack because there's a merchant here.
[09:47.80]And then you can go off and care for your doggy.
[09:51.62]I don't know where you're going.
[09:53.45]Straight west.
[09:54.99]Straight west.
[09:55.71]The game really does not like sometimes when you get on your horse.
[09:59.63]I think it's when we transition areas.
[10:01.35]I don't know.
[10:04.47]Yeah, you kind of... I'll just follow you.
[10:07.57]Wait, I gotta let Otto up.
[10:09.89]Let's get to a spot where I can... Not gonna take me long.
[10:12.79]Maybe less than five minutes.
[10:15.46]Less than two minutes.
[10:19.16]Show Otto.
[10:20.72]Maybe.
[10:20.98]You're good.
[10:24.10]Alright, I'm just gonna... If I just sit here, will that screw anything up?
[10:27.83]No, you're good.
[10:30.05]Oh, also, I got another sacred tear.
[10:31.99]Accidentally.
[10:32.37]Okay.
[10:34.23]I love that for you.
[10:36.14]Alright, I'll be right back.
[10:38.42]I'm just literally just gonna leave this open.
[10:40.00]My merchant's selling two different Seedbed Curses.
[10:44.31]I'm not even going to mute my microphone.
[10:46.01]I mean, I'm muted over here, but I just, you know what?
[10:48.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[10:48.86]No, I'm going to mute you too.
[10:51.62]I've learned over the years.
[10:53.14]This is probably a good idea.
[10:54.58]I don't want to say anything weird, but I'm going to feel pressured like I have to.
[10:58.48]Anytime that you are under pressure to like talk, you just talk and you just, you know what?
[11:04.54]I'm just going to say whatever the fuck I'm going to say.
[11:06.45]Hey, guys, see this.
[11:08.87]He's gone.
[11:09.19]I got rid of him.
[11:10.51]I'll be right back.
[11:11.73]Actually, you know what?
[11:12.63]I'm going to put a BRB screen.
[11:14.06]People are going to be like, what the hell is going on?
[11:15.80]I'll be right back.
[16:36.86]Hello, I'm back.
[16:44.58]Uh, yeah.
[16:48.66]Just tell Ster.
[16:53.66]It's cringe.
[16:55.08]Yeah, that's the first thing people hear.
[16:57.50]That's cringe.
[16:59.40]Alright, so.
[17:01.76]Uh, hold on.
[17:02.46]OK, yeah, sorry I had to take auto out.
[17:08.69]He's good.
[17:09.19]He's relaxing in the other room.
[17:11.41]Was he and is he a good dog?
[17:14.15]Yes.
[17:15.43]Okay.
[17:15.91]That's good to know.
[17:17.52]Of course he is.
[17:18.00]That brings me much joy.
[17:20.38]What's the worst thing he's ever done?
[17:24.98]I don't think there really is anything.
[17:26.10]He's a really good boy.
[17:30.30]He is.
[17:30.88]I remember he doesn't do anything.
[17:32.67]He just kind of chills.
[17:33.65]He just kind of hangs around.
[17:35.39]He kind of hangs out.
[17:40.29]Never like pooped in your bed or anything?
[17:43.38]Ate too many Oreos?
[17:44.60]No, my dog has never pooped in my bed.
[17:48.24]Oh.
[17:49.32]My dog has.
[17:50.59]Bro, your stream title is boring.
[17:54.97]But who cares?
[17:59.10]Randomizer gaming with Ster.
[18:01.08]Who cares?
[18:01.54]That's how I felt too.
[18:02.62]Like just like game with name is like the worst title.
[18:06.11]It is, but that's what yours is.
[18:08.63]Yeah, but I, you're, you're horsing in place.
[18:11.57]Okay.
[18:11.81]Well just let's, let's, let's teleport somewhere.
[18:14.49]Okay.
[18:16.96]Well, I want to teleport to the shack.
[18:19.20]Like, like just actually teleport to the shack that we're right next to.
[18:25.74]New title.
[18:30.21]Name it swag gaming with my man.
[18:37.05]Um, I can't, I, again, as again, I was at the gym.
[18:41.95]I, my brain is gone.
[18:43.54]I, there is no cleverness.
[18:45.50]Ah, shit.
[18:45.92]I forgot.
[18:46.94]You know what?
[18:47.66]Do you know what I really want?
[18:50.88]I do I want to admit it I want pads for my elbows your elbows get just absolutely up like mine do sitting in uh I have like purchased like elbow pads for my chair is it is that a was it worth it yes 100 because when you sit here for long enough I have a double layer
[19:14.94]I feel like it doesn't matter what kind of chair you have.
[19:17.56]You always, if you sit here with your elbows and your forearms in the same spot, you kind of get that like, you know what I mean?
[19:24.72]Like this part of your elbow.
[19:25.54]You're going to get that anyway, but like it is way better with the pads.
[19:30.95]Okay.
[19:31.05]Alright, let's move.
[19:32.57]Let's get started.
[19:33.99]We've been stalling for 15, 20 minutes.
[19:36.29]Where do we get elbow pads?
[19:38.03]This way?
[19:41.38]wait no I want it I want it to go there's like the the swamp area this way I'm gonna put both headphones in just for you well then you're gonna speech jam yourself because you can't hear yourself no actually I've actually gotten a little bit better with this oh you've been training yeah I've been putting both in recently it still kind of sucks but it's fine proud of you
[20:13.23]Oh, I thought there was an enemy in here.
[20:16.51]You're no enemy.
[20:17.67]Whoa, but there's something here.
[20:21.94]Oh, my God.
[20:23.08]I am so lucky in this run.
[20:25.08]I just got... I got Malenia's remembrance.
[20:31.06]I think mine was like a lily, like just a flower.
[20:35.06]That's one of the most expensive ones.
[20:36.98]You should dupe it.
[20:37.94]Drop it.
[20:38.68]Let's go clone it.
[20:39.72]No, no, no.
[20:40.22]Oh, you mean dupe it?
[20:41.00]Yeah, let's go do that.
[20:42.06]Let's go.
[20:42.86]Let's go.
[20:43.24]Let's go.
[20:43.58]Let's go.
[20:45.22]Saddle up.
[20:46.48]Oh my God.
[20:47.26]Is this actually going to work?
[20:49.82]Yeah.
[20:50.06]Am I going to get like 100, 200,000 souls right now?
[20:53.50]They might like the other one you had, the Radon one you had, I think it was, might be reduced.
[20:58.19]in the amount.
[20:58.91]But yeah, you're about to fucking escalate.
[21:05.49]Okay.
[21:08.16]Get off the horse.
[21:11.48]I can't get off the horse.
[21:14.80]I don't think the horse is supposed to be able to come in here.
[21:16.88]I don't think so either.
[21:18.86]Okay, there we go.
[21:22.89]Oh, look at that.
[21:24.46]Let's dupe it.
[21:26.26]Wait, what does it give you if you didn't dupe it?
[21:29.22]What?
[21:29.96]Who cares?
[21:30.40]I'm curious if the items should be different.
[21:35.46]I think it's randomized.
[21:37.16]Give one to Ster.
[21:38.20]Give one to Ster.
[21:39.10]No, fuck that.
[21:40.02]This is my shit.
[21:41.72]Okay.
[21:44.14]I'm kidding.
[21:44.98]I'm kidding.
[21:46.14]No, use them both.
[21:47.28]Juice up.
[21:49.14]How do you... Can I?
[21:51.96]Can you?
[21:52.44]No, you can't.
[21:55.20]You cannot do it.
[21:58.61]The true colors.
[21:59.31]I remember this being an issue last time and my chat was like, I can't remember, but they were like, you can't do it at this one because it's too high level of one, but you can do it at the other one.
[22:07.67]I don't know, man.
[22:10.09]Alright, dude, I have, I have a hundred, I have 110,000 souls.
[22:15.39]right let's go die to like a crab or something alright do you yeah do you want to go somewhere where it's really dangerous and like should we put you want some steaks on this or something because this is not kind of not fair yeah there's another cave up this way I'm pretty sure no I'm not I'm kidding we're not doing this I'm I'm gonna go baby boy little baby oh my god look what he's like skidding
[22:46.79]What the fuck is it?
[22:47.67]What are you doing?
[22:48.43]What is this laugh?
[22:55.95]I'm trying to do my laugh.
[22:58.50]You're trying to do your own laugh.
[23:00.82]Yeah, like that.
[23:01.26]You're doing an impression of yourself laughing.
[23:05.06]Yeah.
[23:08.02]Okay, where did you go?
[23:08.90]Let's teleport back to the shack.
[23:12.86]That was the joker.
[23:17.83]scary it wasn't scary don't I do that we're super desynced I just teleported to the check did you I just said to I voted to warp I voted to warp we're not doing it does it failed
[23:45.78]Um, it says you are going into the ocean.
[23:51.25]That was very weird.
[23:53.33]I rested the bonfire.
[23:54.69]There you are.
[23:56.51]Okay, so this is important because I'm about to level up the most.
[24:00.53]This is probably the last amount of levels I'm going to be able to do for this character.
[24:02.83]That's not true.
[24:06.27]Boom.
[24:07.09]First of all.
[24:08.99]Okay.
[24:10.00]You have so much growth ahead of you, honey.
[24:12.06]Okay, here we go.
[24:18.53]I can only level up six times.
[24:21.51]Alright.
[24:23.45]What's happening here?
[24:25.11]I could do... Oh, dump it all in strength.
[24:30.11]Should I do intelligence?
[24:31.69]Without any thought, dump it all in strength.
[24:34.47]All in intelligence.
[24:36.29]To be able to use this item correctly.
[24:38.73]Please, for the love of God.
[24:40.26]Please, for the love of God.
[24:43.94]Why does that weapon even need intelligence?
[24:49.69]But wait a minute.
[24:53.11]Me, strong, is not supposed to be doing this.
[24:56.45]People are pissed right now.
[24:57.66]You're being weird.
[24:59.62]You're not being strong.
[25:05.00]People are fucking pissed off.
[25:09.65]Alright, well, here's the deal.
[25:11.13]Here's the deal.
[25:13.01]What's the DLC?
[25:14.39]If I put 16 into intelligence, will I be able to effectively use this weapon without it being just like nerfed in my hands?
[25:22.42]Or do I just go boom into strength and go upgrade this greatsword thing that I have with default shit?
[25:29.68]Strength.
[25:30.40]Strength.
[25:31.10]Strength.
[25:31.42]Me strong.
[25:32.12]Me strong.
[25:32.90]Me strong.
[25:33.56]I'm going intelligence and you're copying me.
[25:35.82]You're copying me.
[25:36.68]What do you guys think?
[25:39.24]Do you think... 16 isn't smart.
[25:43.55]It's not.
[25:44.41]What do you... What do you want me to do?
[25:53.39]I want you to put points in Vigor.
[25:57.74]Actually.
[25:58.34]With all of the plus to Estus Blasts you have.
[26:00.88]Yeah.
[26:03.16]I think...
[26:05.92]That way you don't die in like one hit to Placidusax.
[26:08.78]I am going to do something right now and people are going to be really saying, dude, you blew it big time.
[26:13.62]But here's what I'm going to do.
[26:14.66]I blew it.
[26:16.28]I blew it big time.
[26:23.01]I blew it.
[26:25.95]I have to go to the blacksmith because I blew it.
[26:29.05]You blew it?
[26:33.24]where is the no no not yet what do you mean not yet not yet hold while we're here let's I want to do like one thing while we're here but look I have this I can just upgrade this like probably plus 10 plus 15 right now because I have a bunch of stones yeah well you're gonna have to wait you're gonna learn a lesson in patience right now okay so what so let's go wherever you want to go
[27:09.35]Oh, look, look, I found Malenia's remembrance.
[27:11.49]Oh, look, I'm going to get like a plus 10.
[27:12.95]Oh, look, I have like 10 levels.
[27:15.15]But where do you want to go?
[27:18.17]I want to go to this graveyard that's like right here with a whole bunch of items on it and a dragon guarding it.
[27:28.22]Oh, there is a dragon right there.
[27:29.08]OK, cool.
[27:29.62]Let's go.
[27:32.20]Let chat seethe.
[27:35.02]OK, I got like two useless notes off of this graveyard.
[27:39.66]I don't want them to see, but I think that... I think it's worth it.
[27:45.36]Oh, he doesn't have a lot of health.
[28:00.97]We're so desynced in this area for some reason.
[28:03.89]It might be just this spot.
[28:06.26]It seems to go in weird cycles where we desync, but then we get back to normal for like two hours and then it desyncs for like an hour.
[28:13.06]Oops.
[28:13.40]I mean, we're fighting it, so.
[28:18.66]Ow.
[28:39.62]Don't go in the air.
[28:47.59]Dragon, you're being quenched.
[29:06.50]Try hitting it.
[29:08.60]Dude, we're in a weird spot.
[29:10.74]I am not the type of character that can fight a dragon that well.
[29:13.66]Okay?
[29:13.96]Hey, you just... Hey, let him seethe.
[29:20.20]Seethe.
[29:21.75]I hit it.
[29:24.77]Looks to me like the dragon's dead.
[29:34.74]what are you doing I think we're do you think still silly is silly is secret okay that's this is actually a good idea although I didn't really get much did you get anything good no I got like I got like notes and cookbooks like usual
[29:57.70]notes some cookbooks some runes okay so that's completed let's go ahead and mark that as completed I don't think that's normally a boss do you do you want to fight a boss because I know where one is right now yeah this tower of return takes you I figure where this takes you where did you even go yeah we are really distinct it's kind of wandering
[30:30.11]I'm in like a constant state right now of thinking I know where I am and then going somewhere and going, nah, this isn't it.
[30:34.63]Okay, so you teleport to the northern lake, northern lake shore, all the way up where the runes are, the king's realm runes.
[30:47.59]There is a boss right there.
[30:51.64]Where?
[30:52.54]We need to figure out, like people were saying there's a hot key to accept a vote.
[30:58.28]No, do road to the manor first.
[30:59.58]Let me upgrade this fucking sword, please.
[31:03.58]Where the blacksmith is.
[31:05.19]And then right below that is a boss we can fight.
[31:08.29]LB in the map, apparently.
[31:10.11]You have to be in the map.
[31:13.52]Oh.
[31:14.24]And then, yeah, then it centers on whatever you voted for.
[31:17.96]Really?
[31:18.22]That's cool.
[31:24.30]I'm kind of the master of trying to teleport somewhere and just placing markers on it.
[31:31.92]Markers are so helpful.
[31:33.36]We need to keep doing it.
[31:37.88]Alright.
[31:38.76]Do you have any Smithing Stone six?
[31:41.97]I probably do, but I'm likely about to use them.
[31:44.95]No, I don't.
[31:46.49]But so this is the idea.
[31:48.55]Here we go.
[31:52.88]The idea is this.
[31:54.01]Why is this acting like I never talked to him?
[31:56.97]Okay.
[31:59.25]See this banished knight's greatsword?
[32:02.00]I'm thinking of just upgrading the hell out of this right now.
[32:06.93]Just upgrading this.
[32:09.52]And infusing it.
[32:11.44]Right?
[32:12.04]Either this or the Battleaxe.
[32:13.74]And I don't know which one is better, because I don't know min-max bullshit.
[32:19.03]Battleaxe or Banished Knight Greatsword.
[32:21.53]Which one of these is, like, better to use?
[32:27.03]I think the Greatsword would probably be better.
[32:35.35]Sword, big sword, sword, sword, sword, sword.
[32:37.55]Axe is cooler.
[32:38.37]Sword, sword, sword, sword.
[32:39.65]Axe is cooler.
[32:40.81]Axe, trust me.
[32:42.01]Sword, sword, sword, sword.
[32:43.29]I need more smithing.
[32:50.41]I can't believe not every person in your chat didn't say the same thing.
[32:55.31]How many more Smithing Stone ones do I need?
[32:58.99]God damn it.
[33:00.11]You need three Smithing Stone ones to get out of, I think, I think three.
[33:05.54]Yeah, I need you know, I need two more Smithing Stone ones that I can you can buy them at the shop at the Place Um, can I can I just go there?
[33:18.93]Can I just get this out of the way and I promise I won't be doing this again.
[33:22.47]Yeah He grinded off stream
[33:32.53]I didn't grind off stream.
[33:34.25]I just prepared off stream.
[33:38.95]I didn't get exposed.
[33:39.89]I literally killed the same enemy 10 times and then bought like a dozen stones at the vendor.
[33:46.22]Did you accept it?
[33:47.84]I thought I did.
[33:56.20]Here.
[33:56.82]I was just gonna fucking banish you.
[34:00.65]I have the cheap upgrade thing and I think you don't was part of the situation as well.
[34:04.65]What do you mean?
[34:05.95]That you have to actually spend like three, six smithing stones.
[34:11.08]Yes, I do.
[34:12.52]I don't.
[34:13.40]So that was the whole problem yesterday.
[34:15.00]The whole problem was you have like the cheat code and I don't.
[34:19.39]Who's this?
[34:22.17]Oh, it's okay.
[34:24.19]This is very, very odd.
[34:30.41]I thought that was a chicken.
[34:35.69]Okay, how many of these things do I need?
[34:48.23]Oh, back already?
[34:50.76]Lay out your arms then.
[34:54.71]Tarnished.
[34:55.95]Where are you going?
[34:56.59]You played this game fucking thousands of times.
[35:00.65]How have you not figured out where the blacksmith is permanently in your brain?
[35:05.10]Fucking idiot.
[35:06.78]I just don't know how it's possible.
[35:09.68]It's by the fire.
[35:10.50]To the left of the fire.
[35:11.58]Don't forget that ever again.
[35:12.98]Okay, we're good.
[35:20.35]boom boom boom go go go alright I got a plus eight I got a plus eight great sword I need one more Smithing Stone three do you have one of those Smithing Stone three just a regular Smithing Stone three I do excellent could I please have it I will trade you for something that I have what do you need
[35:49.97]I needed, like, a spell.
[35:52.75]You want me to list out the spells I have?
[35:54.59]Do you actually have spells?
[35:56.07]Do you have any, like, crystal greatswords or anything?
[36:00.03]I have... This one's really important.
[36:02.30]You need this one.
[36:04.02]There.
[36:04.36]There's your... And I also have Gelmir's Fury.
[36:09.74]You need Starlight.
[36:10.90]I want Arcane.
[36:12.44]Pick that up off the ground.
[36:13.65]It does not belong on the ground.
[36:14.95]What do you mean you picked it up?
[36:18.23]starlight did you pick this one up no that I dropped the stone for you oh tanish what the is wrong with you Mike here we go I have a plus 10 great sword now and it's good and it's it's just a regular sword I can infuse it
[36:47.78]What stone do you need after that?
[36:50.94]Hold on.
[36:51.22]Let me do this first.
[36:53.22]This is probably this one, right?
[36:54.64]Heavy.
[36:56.99]206, 167.
[36:58.41]That.
[36:59.19]Okay.
[37:00.05]I have Smithing Stone fours you can use to get to 12.
[37:02.05]Or is this better?
[37:07.49]No, no, I am.
[37:09.71]Should I put fire on it?
[37:13.81]I need...
[37:16.98]You shouldn't put fire on it because then I think it's faith scaling.
[37:19.88]Okay.
[37:21.86]What do I need?
[37:22.38]Fours?
[37:22.84]I need Smithing Stone fours.
[37:26.32]Flame of Redmane is insane.
[37:27.77]I need... Do I need... I need one Smithing Stone four.
[37:38.69]And then we'll just have to go.
[37:39.81]Do you have any Smithing Stone fours?
[37:43.76]yeah I have two also one down take this as well because I have a couple of scrolls like spell scrolls that you should probably be using royal house scroll I can't leave it never mind I put it down in the main room yeah thank you so much
[38:13.60]Okay, now everything is going to be good to go.
[38:16.00]I have a plus 11.
[38:18.38]This thing's doing like, this thing's doing like three, 400 damage.
[38:22.59]This thing's good to go.
[38:26.47]The crag blade is shit on bosses.
[38:29.59]I just want it for the scaling.
[38:31.13]Use fire, use fire.
[38:32.61]Everyone's telling you you're wrong.
[38:34.79]Yeah, I am wrong.
[38:36.49]There is one fire that I believe is faith and there's one that's actually strength.
[38:42.52]I am wrong and I apologize.
[38:44.04]That's like less damage though.
[38:48.16]Alright.
[38:49.30]Wait, what?
[38:50.66]Wait, what just happened?
[38:56.67]Is this better?
[38:59.61]Oh, it's split damage.
[39:07.11]Craig, please!
[39:09.51]Okay, here's what's gonna happen.
[39:16.78]Why am I so confused by this?
[39:18.94]This is 232... 232... 214... 135 versus... 214... No, it's just whatever.
[39:28.32]It's the fucking same.
[39:29.88]It's OP fire.
[39:30.80]I'm just gonna keep this.
[39:31.40]This is what I'm using for now.
[39:32.34]We'll figure it out later.
[39:37.44]Fire infusion, please.
[39:40.04]The greatsword swings.
[39:40.94]You're picking the same infusion.
[39:42.50]What?
[39:44.41]Alright, I gotta stop looking at chat because I look over here and I go, wait, what?
[39:47.00]And I look over here and I go, no.
[39:48.36]Alright, here's what I'm doing.
[39:52.94]My brain is split between two spots.
[39:55.74]Here's what I'm doing.
[39:59.42]That's what I'm doing.
[40:05.64]That's what I'm doing.
[40:09.72]I can't just flip-flop for the next hour.
[40:11.89]Okay, I'm ready.
[40:20.32]From here, where do you want to go?
[40:23.30]Flame of Redmayne got nerfed so hard.
[40:25.90]It's shit now, chat.
[40:27.10]I don't know.
[40:27.66]I'm just going to go with the crag.
[40:30.70]Do something that you like.
[40:32.52]That's what I'm going to do.
[40:34.50]Now, you want to go fight the boss?
[40:36.08]Go back to the smith.
[40:36.84]I'm going to go down.
[40:43.16]That actually lightens up the load a little bit.
[40:45.88]I can put on some better armor.
[40:48.98]Alright, we're good.
[40:52.32]Just a short 45-minute stall.
[40:54.20]It's not a big deal.
[40:54.80]It's not stall, it's progression.
[40:57.70]That's true.
[41:01.07]We're not going to do a raid as a guild until your gear score goes up.
[41:08.12]Tell chat to stop being backseat Andes.
[41:10.82]No, I mean, here's the problem.
[41:12.66]I keep asking different questions and reading.
[41:15.24]So I ask five questions and then I get an answer to the second question.
[41:19.38]And I think it's an answer to the first question while people are spamming an answer for the fourth question.
[41:24.81]So I'm like so confused.
[41:27.91]It's my own fault.
[41:28.99]Answers to questions that are that like also played the game a while ago and they've actually patched and balanced a lot of stuff.
[41:35.33]And like, I don't even know what is real anymore.
[41:38.52]It's my fault, though.
[41:40.04]It's not their fault.
[41:41.40]Alright.
[41:43.82]So, you ready to fight the boss?
[41:46.51]There is a catacombs, like, right here.
[41:48.77]Yeah, it's literally... I have it marked.
[41:52.81]I did have it marked.
[41:54.49]And it's marked... Where is it?
[41:58.42]Right here.
[42:04.55]It's right here somewhere or is it?
[42:07.57]This place is a bit of a mess.
[42:10.93]I haven't marked like right here.
[42:14.35]I'm doing so much more damage.
[42:15.81]I'm doing like 300 damage to swing now.
[42:17.17]This is so worth it.
[42:22.10]This is a crab coming over here.
[42:25.70]I got wrecked.
[42:29.74]Are you alive?
[42:31.06]Yeah.
[42:34.95]Uh, it's over.
[42:36.09]It's not over there.
[42:36.71]It's over here.
[42:37.79]It's near my marker.
[42:38.69]Where the hell is my marker?
[42:46.27]I remember every playthrough I've ever done.
[42:48.08]I've wandered around this place forgetting where this hole is.
[42:50.76]It's right here.
[42:52.20]My marker is right here.
[42:54.72]It's right here somewhere.
[42:59.22]God damn it.
[43:00.48]Where is it?
[43:04.29]Oh, shit.
[43:05.35]Hey, you want to go back to round two?
[43:08.93]It's the floor?
[43:09.71]Oh, it's an illusion floor.
[43:11.31]It's an illusion floor.
[43:11.95]I was saying, like, what the hell?
[43:13.54]I know there's, like, some trick to this one.
[43:17.86]Oh, shit.
[43:24.82]What the hell is... This is an interesting swing.
[43:33.42]This is kind of a... This is like a goofy swing.
[43:44.83]What?
[43:47.01]Where are you?
[43:47.67]I make a giant rock candy stick?
[43:49.73]I'm not getting rid of this.
[43:50.97]Why did you guys want me to do anything else?
[43:53.19]Uh, down here.
[43:57.99]This thing does 400 damage now.
[43:59.39]You gotta be shitting me.
[44:00.47]I can't believe people were telling me to do the fire.
[44:04.75]uh when you say down here okay so let me come find you I think I there there we are okay and for reference I have a plus 20 long sword now and when you ask me in two hours and you're like surprised that I have it I just want you to know now you have a plus 20 did you grind off stream no dude did you see my like super cool rock candy sword
[44:30.96]I did not.
[44:31.40]This is so cool.
[44:32.70]Wow.
[44:33.24]I actually love this.
[44:34.50]I didn't even know this was in the game.
[44:38.54]Huh?
[44:38.82]Yeah, I've never seen that.
[44:39.44]That's so cool.
[44:40.42]It looks like a kebab gone wrong.
[44:44.23]Yeah, it looks like a kebab you left on the grill for like six hours.
[44:48.29]Alright, let's do it.
[44:54.86]Okay, well, this is a problem.
[44:57.02]Wait, maybe don't aggro that.
[44:58.30]Don't aggro the Crucible Knight.
[45:12.23]I think he's gonna get spawned in.
[45:13.63]Yep, he is.
[45:14.55]That's when he gets activated.
[45:16.13]Alright, it is imperative that we fo- This room is so small, we have to just like co-op the fuck out of one of them early.
[45:26.10]I vote the one with less health.
[45:31.44]Well, I mean like when we first get in here, like we just- Nice, holy shit.
[45:42.67]There's no way!
[45:43.43]There's no way!
[45:44.43]There's no way!
[45:47.19]I can't believe that.
[45:47.89]Why did it not hit him?
[45:52.16]How did that not hit him?
[45:53.06]It's alright.
[45:58.22]You have a 1v1 now with your plus 20 sword.
[46:00.30]You can do it.
[46:00.82]It's a regular Crucible Knight.
[46:02.18]The worst part about this is doing them both at the same time.
[46:04.12]I'm used to doing them with a shield that can parry.
[46:06.46]This one can't.
[46:17.12]My damage is too low against him.
[46:19.34]I need to parry him.
[46:20.36]Remember the timings?
[46:25.96]The shield cannot parry.
[46:27.96]Oh, you actually can't parry.
[46:29.18]Yeah, and I'm out of healing.
[46:36.91]Well, it looks like you're just going to have to do it.
[46:43.15]It's alright.
[46:44.85]I don't know.
[46:45.53]The hitbox, he apparently, I don't know.
[46:47.11]I swung the sword at him and it just didn't hurt him.
[46:51.01]America?
[46:52.03]Yeah.
[46:53.94]We can do it.
[46:54.28]I'm going to switch my shield.
[47:03.64]We just need to go absolutely hard on the first boss.
[47:12.00]I love that word.
[47:14.85]A misbegotten.
[47:21.33]I love how you Red Dead just left your horse like... Well, the horses keep desyncing so I just got off of it.
[47:27.37]I don't know.
[47:42.26]I'm down here.
[47:43.02]Hold on, don't go in.
[47:49.12]Alright.
[47:50.41]Let's go.
[47:58.39]I just rolled right into that.
[47:59.47]Okay.
[48:13.24]I'm going to distract this one over here.
[48:14.50]I still don't know the timings on these guys at all.
[48:17.14]It's been so long since I've seen them.
[48:20.66]I'd rather fight the Crucible Knight.
[48:26.86]The Crucible Knight has so much health.
[48:28.44]He's distracted.
[48:33.00]I died.
[48:34.88]You distracted him right into me.
[48:37.14]He kind of just decided he was going to go after you.
[48:42.84]What the?
[49:16.16]Crucible Knight is being so respectful.
[49:18.40]I know.
[49:18.60]He really is.
[49:19.38]He's letting us duel.
[49:23.33]Oh, this is over now.
[49:25.17]Nope.
[49:25.61]Nope.
[49:25.99]Nope.
[49:29.29]Jesus, that's fucking fast.
[49:31.98]The Misbegotten Warrior is so annoying because he does that jump in the air where he has two jump in the air swing at yous.
[49:39.17]One of them is insanely fast and one is incredibly slow.
[49:43.03]Let me... I will try and take aggro from the Crucible Knight once he spawns.
[49:49.12]That's one of the bosses, like the early one that you fight in the Jail.
[49:54.07]That might be one of the longest times I spent fighting a boss in Elden Ring.
[49:57.65]To be fair, I consider this fight to be one of the worst fights in the whole game.
[50:04.04]What do you mean this randomized fight?
[50:06.02]What do you mean this fight?
[50:06.98]This boss fight.
[50:10.94]Did you not do this either?
[50:14.82]It's randomized.
[50:15.64]What do you mean?
[50:16.66]Did he not do this in the main game?
[50:19.26]Oh my god, dude.
[50:20.68]Hold on.
[50:21.54]Have you never seen these two in the same room together?
[50:24.78]No.
[50:27.16]Dude, you gotta play Elden Ring.
[50:28.46]What are you talking about?
[50:31.84]You gotta play Elden Ring, man.
[50:36.52]You've never seen these two people in the same boss fight.
[50:40.98]I don't think so.
[50:43.26]Okay, so in Redan's area, when you go to fight Redan, you did not fight these two.
[50:53.58]Did you ever go back to Verdansk Castle?
[50:56.79]Yeah.
[50:59.21]This is a boss fight in the game.
[51:00.87]It's the Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior.
[51:03.33]Okay, I guess I missed it.
[51:04.51]Holy shit.
[51:05.01]Sorry.
[51:05.31]Oh my god.
[51:07.43]I'm like jealous of you.
[51:11.86]I'm actually like incredibly jealous of you.
[51:15.70]You've got like a lot of game.
[51:18.44]Well, I've got like full aggro.
[51:19.76]Let's start hitting them.
[51:23.36]This fight sucks.
[51:32.87]Unbelievable.
[51:33.75]Unbelievable start.
[51:39.75]Unbelievable start.
[51:48.21]He's almost dead.
[51:48.82]Careful.
[52:00.20]He's coming this way.
[52:01.34]I'm fucking this up so bad.
[52:05.20]If I could just land one fucking hit on this guy!
[52:07.44]Okay, he's dead.
[52:09.99]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[52:22.29]He does have a shitload of health, oh my god.
[52:25.07]the armor we need like a blunt weapon I think this is technically blunt there he goes with this
[53:08.82]Good.
[53:09.08]Good.
[53:09.28]Good.
[53:09.44]Good.
[53:09.60]Good.
[53:16.86]Uh-oh.
[53:18.28]Uh-oh.
[53:18.76]Uh-oh.
[53:19.08]Uh-oh.
[53:21.44]It's okay.
[53:21.74]I got it.
[53:22.10]I got it.
[53:22.56]I got it.
[53:22.86]I got it.
[53:23.30]You got it.
[53:28.92]You can't win the first part of the day.
[53:30.32]We're good.
[53:35.28]We're good.
[53:38.26]I thought I was going crazy because when we were talking about how this was not in the real game.
[53:43.57]So it's inside Redan's castle.
[53:44.91]Redan.
[53:45.37]You got me saying it.
[53:46.53]I'm sorry.
[53:49.57]Yeah, so when you first said that, you were like, what are you talking about?
[53:52.29]This is randomized.
[53:53.01]I thought you were fucking with me.
[53:55.31]no I um redon's castle had like all the chimeras and stuff the kimeras so I was like nah I didn't explore it too much actually I don't blame you because that area is is probably one of the shittiest areas in the whole game I didn't even know there was a catacomb in there yeah
[54:17.42]I do not blame you for skipping that part of the optional kind of stuff.
[54:20.61]Well, I'm dead and I got to get my souls on that item.
[54:23.65]Do you want me to bonfire?
[54:26.33]Yeah.
[54:26.71]Okay.
[54:31.57]Go to the castle before the festival.
[54:33.46]I thought once you get to the castle, the festival has already started.
[54:37.24]I think if you... I think if you beat...
[54:41.32]Redan?
[54:42.04]If you kill Redan and then you go, maybe you skip it, right?
[54:45.20]Uh, where's the bonfire from here?
[54:51.88]No.
[54:52.04]I think a lot of people don't bother going back after the tourney.
[55:03.41]It's possible this fight only happens if you go to Redmane early.
[55:07.33]It doesn't happen after the tourney.
[55:09.27]Even afterwards.
[55:12.42]There's one of the teleporters that just takes you straight to the festival.
[55:16.03]And then it was like, okay, festival.
[55:17.97]Then I did Verdun.
[55:19.35]And then the whole castle looked like shit.
[55:21.89]Oh, yes, it does.
[55:22.53]I already did the boss.
[55:24.37]So why would I go back to the castle?
[55:27.05]It can happen after, I guess.
[55:28.61]It does happen after.
[55:29.39]This is the hardest to find.
[55:39.20]I'm lost again.
[55:40.04]I'll help you.
[55:40.38]Don't worry.
[55:42.65]I think I know.
[55:43.33]Leave me alone.
[55:43.83]Leave me alone.
[55:48.09]Sorry, I got so upset with you for not knowing where the secret boss was.
[55:52.31]That's impossible to find.
[55:52.85]We're going to run into something that I did that you didn't do.
[55:56.61]I'm going to say probably not.
[55:58.85]And I'm going to give you one reason why that is.
[56:01.43]It's not because of playing it, but it's because of watching every single Vaati video on this game.
[56:07.17]So I don't think there's anything I haven't seen.
[56:18.28]Not for my own doing.
[56:22.54]What did you get in there?
[56:24.78]Like a spear.
[56:26.30]Oh, cool.
[56:26.70]I got a glass shard.
[56:28.42]I've been picking up a lot of glass.
[56:29.62]My hands are raw.
[56:32.56]See, I just thought you were messing with me.
[56:35.52]I was trying to mess with you back.
[56:37.36]But then I was the wrong one.
[56:39.22]I remember we were talking before the stream started about how I'm actually a FromSoft fraud.
[56:46.16]I don't think that's true.
[56:51.50]In Sekiro, you know the big giant fire beast?
[56:54.56]Yeah.
[56:55.42]Did you do that?
[56:57.13]Yeah, I did.
[56:58.57]I did not do that either.
[57:03.39]There's a lot of things that I've noped out of.
[57:06.60]But hold on.
[57:08.02]I'm a bit of a fraud.
[57:09.42]Isn't that smart though?
[57:12.24]you're just kind of smart because if you go to like an optional area and you're just like this is dumb I'm not doing this you're kind of like like really shitty uh from sauce bosses I actually that that fire boss and sakira's is way up there for me yeah doing the the the hate with the hatred hatred boss right doing that boss and after like the 20th attempt just going like you know what I could like go mow the lawn right now I don't need to do this
[57:39.64]I'd rather mow the lawn.
[57:41.62]I don't think that's a bad thing.
[57:48.77]Uh... So, let me clear that.
[57:51.81]Okay.
[57:58.93]Okay, I think we have an opportunity to attempt the boss again.
[58:02.92]Placidus's success?
[58:05.25]But I feel like if we do that this early, we might get trapped there, and it might be, like, a disaster, so... Let's, um... You know how you, uh... You can go up the whole right side or left side of the lake?
[58:15.60]Mm-hmm.
[58:16.32]Like, let's just go, like... We haven't done any of that.
[58:18.11]There's, like, a whole Erdtree, and there's catacombs, and there's a whole bunch of stuff on both sides.
[58:22.03]Yeah.
[58:23.21]Let's take it slow.
[58:24.89]What do you wanna... Left or right side?
[58:27.56]Um...
[58:32.18]Let's go on the left side.
[58:33.80]I feel like there's more things over there.
[58:36.46]I remember.
[58:37.34]Let's start at the the ruins way at the bottom and just like hug the left.
[58:43.37]And then you go up into like the Albany village and all that.
[58:49.41]Oh, you want to go?
[58:49.85]You want to go all the way down?
[58:51.01]Down.
[58:51.23]OK.
[58:51.91]Yeah.
[58:52.11]And on the map, remember, press left bumper.
[58:53.93]It'll take you straight to it.
[58:55.03]Yeah.
[58:58.91]That we hold that left side is interesting, I think.
[59:10.46]No map.
[59:11.10]Wait, I have to get a map.
[59:15.63]What is this title?
[59:17.63]Randomizer with Ster.
[59:18.83]Emotional Halloween special.
[59:21.53]That's better.
[59:22.93]That's actually pretty good.
[59:24.47]That's good.
[59:25.09]It's way better than I did.
[59:28.64]I am getting a bit emotional.
[59:31.60]Our full emotional playthrough.
[59:34.34]Emotional Halloween special.
[59:37.86]I should be in like an orange shirt.
[59:45.82]To be really fair, though, that whole Ronnie quest line, I don't think is, at least in my opinion, I don't know how you would do any of that.
[59:56.51]Like, there's so much of that that's kind of, I was just like, why would I do this?
[60:00.02]I actually did do it.
[60:01.84]I mean, I got a lot of help.
[60:03.66]Cave right here.
[60:05.36]I mean, I had to read, like, you know, there's no way you do it, like, intuitively yourself.
[60:09.18]But that's what I mean.
[60:09.99]It's a total mess.
[60:11.11]That's what I mean.
[60:11.85]Like, doing that without any guidance is, like, I don't even know why you would even do some of that stuff.
[60:15.73]Why would you even attempt?
[60:16.75]How do people even, how do you, I feel like a lot of people kind of stumble upon it.
[60:20.77]Like the first people that do that mission, they stumble upon it and they go, what the fuck just happened?
[60:26.97]And then they go, oh my God.
[60:27.81]And they, and they write it down because obviously it's the first person.
[60:30.45]It took me to a whole bunch of places I didn't even know existed.
[60:32.85]Like the whole ant, like ants as an enemy type was like one of the last things I found in the whole game was like, I don't know how I misliked an entire like ant cave.
[60:42.08]Yeah.
[60:44.74]I think that's part of the reason why people like these games so much, though, is because it's just stuff that you're never going to do.
[60:52.36]And that's cool.
[60:54.01]Yeah.
[60:56.45]Thank God we bought lanterns.
[60:57.29]Let me cast my magics!
[60:59.69]Wrong one.
[61:01.15]Wait.
[61:01.79]Don't do it yet.
[61:02.35]I know what you're about to do.
[61:03.27]Don't do it yet.
[61:03.71]Where are you?
[61:04.73]What?
[61:06.45]I cast Starlight.
[61:07.61]No!
[61:08.24]It's okay.
[61:09.86]Oh.

[62:16.16]I thought there was a turn in here.
[62:17.46]I did too.
[62:17.94]Oh, you gotta go into the waterfall.
[62:27.20]Oh, what am I talking about here?
[62:33.10]What the hell are you doing?
[62:34.16]I mean, I gotta get something from the nominees this year.
[62:37.66]We haven't done it once.
[62:42.04]I'm just gonna do this now so that a year from now people can tell me this was the worst sound gotta make sure that category could get filled out at the end of the year um I think we go down down wait I gotta I got a epic I got an epic loot up here what oh yeah you do go down of lunak
[63:25.68]Nice.
[63:33.41]There's usually something scary down here, isn't there?
[63:35.05]At the end of this cave, I believe it would normally be one of the berserker guys.
[63:42.47]It sounds like a dragon.
[63:44.81]It's very loud.
[63:46.55]It has very heavy footsteps.
[63:58.42]Yo, watch my back!
[64:00.10]These guys don't get... Watch my back, bro.
[64:06.34]I can't do that when the thing explodes.
[64:12.22]Secrets over here?
[64:13.66]Oh, hey, hey, I got to cast my spell.
[64:17.24]Wait, OK.
[64:19.88]Getting a little.
[64:21.08]It's a little dark in here, man.
[64:22.30]I think he maybe gets fucking starlight kid.
[64:25.58]There it is.
[64:25.98]Thank you.
[64:27.09]I'm only going to do that once.
[64:28.65]I don't.
[64:29.19]I don't even know what that was.
[64:31.23]I'm only going to do that once.
[64:33.87]Every 10 minutes.
[64:35.21]Okay, I've gotten like four stabs at this point and one spell.
[64:41.92]I even upgraded the ones.
[64:43.58]Oh God.
[64:45.79]What?
[64:46.66]That's a lot of guys.
[64:47.72]Why?
[64:47.86]And why they don't?
[64:48.64]Why they don't?
[64:49.18]They don't care.
[64:49.74]They were over here.
[64:50.88]I'm going to take their item.
[64:53.28]No, you angered them.
[64:58.28]Oh, no, you have angered them.
[65:02.35]Alright, well, fuck them up.
[65:07.47]Why is this one's huge?
[65:10.45]Oh, you've never seen the huge Albinauric?
[65:13.57]Yeah, I have.
[65:16.67]Have you seen the huge albion here?
[65:19.15]Yeah.
[65:20.50]Nice.
[65:21.74]See?
[65:21.94]I got something good here.
[65:27.34]Oh, man, I think that's actually fucking a thousand times better than what I have.
[65:32.22]God, every item you pick up is a thousand times better than what you have.
[65:35.06]Let's go upgrade it.
[65:35.86]But I really, I really mean it this time.
[65:38.46]Like, I think this actually is like unbelievable.
[65:43.44]It's faith weapon, whatever.
[65:45.26]I'm sticking with what I have.
[65:46.74]What is it?
[65:48.00]God Slayer Greatsword.
[65:51.88]Oh, oh, God, God flame.
[65:55.08]Oh, flame.
[65:56.19]Another staff.
[66:11.98]Oh, be careful when we go through the darkness if something's going to appear.
[66:14.74]Ooh.
[66:18.32]Ooh, a jar!
[66:24.52]That's another good one.
[66:27.31]I can't believe Elden Beast was down here.
[66:30.09]Don't say that.
[66:35.65]Cool.
[66:38.05]Is it time to put pants on?
[66:41.49]Yes, it is.
[66:47.21]Oh, look out.
[66:48.47]It's a snail.
[66:54.08]This is the gimmick fight.
[66:55.38]It is the gimmick fight.
[66:58.96]Just to go where it's kind of lit up.
[67:03.10]Like a glow.
[67:04.38]I'm just distracting the guy.
[67:07.62]You handle the snail.
[67:09.04]He's just staying in the same spot.
[67:11.00]He's kind of dumb.
[67:18.12]Elden Beast.
[67:20.08]Cookbook.
[67:25.20]Got a flower.
[67:26.10]This is a question for chat.
[67:28.70]These two weapons are effectively the exact same weapon.
[67:31.78]But there's weird... This one scales differently.
[67:35.83]Do I have the right call?
[67:38.39]Is the bandage still better than this?
[67:44.57]You could do fire on the other one and do a weld them.
[67:49.86]Okay.
[67:51.24]I'm going to get this to plus 20 at least.
[67:53.58]Right?
[67:54.42]We have to... At least.
[67:56.06]I got ice frying hatchet.
[67:58.87]I think that is one of the things that actually did get nerfed a lot that's the speed run kind of broken speed run item right the the earliest I think that was one of like the first nerves
[68:16.78]That was an epic dungeon there, my friend.
[68:20.43]No, that was good.
[68:20.89]We got some good stuff.
[68:42.36]The medallion... That's a good question.
[68:43.88]The medallions might be a problem.
[68:46.20]We can get there.
[68:46.68]I have one of them.
[68:47.52]Oh, you do already have one of them.
[68:48.72]I have the, like, left Haligtree medallion.
[68:51.08]Okay.
[68:51.74]Uh, I think you just have to teleport out of this one.
[68:56.65]Yeah, I think we... We need to go get the map.
[68:58.75]Can we go to, like, the south Ray Lucaria gate?
[69:02.59]And just get the map.
[69:06.51]Uh... Okay.
[69:08.25]Because... Yeah, this is... Irritating me.
[69:23.15]Did you vote?
[69:25.17]Wait.
[69:27.48]Change that.
[69:28.52]Go to the Laskiar Ruins.
[69:40.23]You hate my teeth.
[69:43.11]They're mine.
[69:43.47]You don't have to worry about them.
[70:01.67]In the middle of that, somebody goes, hey dude, thanks for clearing up my mucus.
[70:05.29]I appreciate it.
[70:09.63]Did you?
[70:10.33]No, I just look over here sometimes and somebody just writes a random sentence.
[70:17.32]I feel like that person was actually talking to a doctor and they talked in the wrong channel.
[70:26.34]He's a bot.
[70:28.45]Although, why would you text that to your doctor?
[70:31.27]Oh, hey, dude.
[70:32.05]Thanks for clearing up my mucus.
[70:33.13]Really appreciate it.
[70:34.13]It's like... I mean, if your doctor helped you with your mucus, I'm sure he'd like to hear that he helped.
[70:46.15]But if I went... I don't know.
[70:47.59]Every time I've gone to the doctor, it's not like, oh, hey, yeah, I'm going to text you and let you know when my throat gets better.
[70:56.60]I don't know where you're going.
[70:57.84]I got the map.
[70:59.52]Oh, I'm just trying to get all you want it.
[71:01.56]I'm just trying to get away from all the.
[71:03.52]You made me turn around and now I'm getting attacked.
[71:11.54]OK.
[71:15.21]Uh, now we can go wherever you want.
[71:21.47]Come mortar.
[71:22.05]Can you see where I am?
[71:23.17]Yes, I can.
[71:23.63]Yeah, there's like a jumpy over here.
[71:27.40]And there should be a jail up here.
[71:29.99]Ooh, let's do it.
[71:33.73]Again.
[71:36.15]As I think is how it's pronounced.
[71:43.60]I got 10k souls on me.
[71:44.68]I should probably like use that at some point.
[71:47.90]I do too.
[71:51.15]But let's just hope there's not something horrible in here.
[71:58.94]I don't think this is that bad.
[72:16.65]Oh my god.
[72:17.47]I thought you were going to swing again, but you didn't.
[72:41.75]I don't know what this is.
[72:44.69]I think it just means I go a little bit faster and I'm a little bit stronger.
[72:47.65]No, I mean the boss, what the boss is doing.
[72:53.75]No, I think that's what it was.
[72:55.37]My weapon has a coating on it now.
[72:58.12]Oh.
[73:04.86]Ooh.
[73:06.86]You get anything good?
[73:08.64]Not really.
[73:09.02]I already had that Smithing Stone sevens.
[73:12.98]Are those better than what I had on?
[73:37.22]Kind of.
[73:50.82]They're watching us.
[73:55.44]They are?
[73:55.82]Okay.
[73:58.04]Very, very nice.
[74:00.45]I don't know.
[74:00.77]Why is this marked?
[74:03.89]This lakeshore chat.
[74:05.11]Why did I mark this?
[74:07.63]You've been marking things whenever they're complete, I felt like.
[74:11.21]I've been doing... Complete is a sword.
[74:13.11]This means like... Is it a merchant?
[74:15.11]Oh, the crab merchant is here.
[74:16.42]Okay.
[74:17.42]But I can take this off because I took the...
[74:24.06]uh the ball bearing alright let's go up that let's just hug this uh left side like you want to do yeah no you're gonna have to get over it I'm not I'm not saying that chat wants me to do something and I'm just gonna have to you're just gonna have to get over it this is not happening you're just gonna have to get over it
[74:51.81]You got lobstered.
[74:58.63]Oh God.
[75:04.60]You're going like a really strange way through this forest.
[75:08.94]I saw like a lot of enemies I didn't want to do anything to.
[75:12.26]Is that another?
[75:13.30]Okay, what's with the dragons?
[75:16.64]What's with all these dragons?
[75:18.39]That's the same thing I said when I was watching Game of Thrones.
[75:25.71]That sounds like somebody that's never heard of the series before.
[75:29.47]And sat down in the middle of an episode.
[75:33.04]Uh oh.
[75:39.80]Let's just hold left.
[75:44.57]believe there's a cave or something here no I'm wrong oh I feel like there might be something there
[76:02.24]I think we go down.
[76:03.23]I want to you know that place where you fight like the giant and like the whole horde of people.
[76:08.81]I like that spot.
[76:11.49]That was always my like weapon test zone because you respond right next to like the battle.
[76:17.50]Armazul is going to be really easy.
[76:19.24]Actually really might be.
[76:20.60]We might be able to walk through it.
[76:24.07]It's all the random enemies.
[76:24.89]It's not going to be as horrible.
[76:35.14]OK, so we need to go.
[76:37.08]You want to go like up?
[76:40.38]I could use that rotten crystal sword.
[76:46.95]The mob that you were talking about is on the east side of Larinia.
[77:01.34]I love that.
[77:06.04]That's my favorite character.
[77:10.98]What the hell is happening?
[77:19.59]I gotta get off the horse.
[77:20.45]It's a fucking bra, dude.
[77:23.97]I made it.
[77:28.02]There's so many people up here.
[77:30.47]We gotta kill that caster, man.
[77:33.23]I'm getting pelted.
[77:36.07]My game doesn't know what to target.
[77:39.53]Oh my god, I'm so overwhelmed.
[77:41.12]Just swing.
[77:42.44]Okay, caster is... Cast... Get...
[77:57.61]This bat mother fucker get away from me.
[78:00.75]OK, it's clear up here.
[78:05.17]It's clear up here.
[78:15.98]Clear up here.
[78:16.44]I want to spend my souls.
[78:20.64]My runes.
[78:21.58]That's probably a good idea.
[78:27.66]Where's the boss fight?
[78:28.30]It's up a little more, right?
[78:30.06]Across the bridge and down.
[78:42.27]You get the guy up here.
[78:44.88]I can't remember why you need him.
[78:46.26]Yeah, I'm just trying to level up.
[78:59.57]I need way more endurance than this.
[79:08.24]OK.
[79:20.02]He's in the can, right?
[79:25.55]He's on the can.
[79:32.21]Oh, dear me.
[79:36.46]I haven't a clue.
[79:38.20]No secrets lie with me, not a one.
[79:40.24]Oh, please leave me be.
[79:44.14]Wait, Dan.
[79:45.34]You're not one of them?
[79:46.28]Well... Don't interrupt.
[79:52.26]Oh, goodness me.
[79:55.16]I am Albus and Albinauric.
[79:59.74]As you can see, we're finished.
[80:03.07]The whole village is finished.
[80:05.57]The curse mongers have destroyed everything.
[80:09.27]No one that remains has their wits about them.
[80:12.59]I beg you.
[80:14.65]Would you look after this medallion?
[80:16.58]That's a nice medallion.
[80:18.04]Alright, that's cool.
[80:20.78]I got a memory stone and a sacred tear.
[80:22.72]Oh no, this old man's mind is fucking gone.
[80:27.06]Take this medallion, please!
[80:29.90]Like a turd in his hand.
[80:33.81]This is not what that is, man.
[80:40.04]That's my first flask upgrade.
[80:46.12]I'm so glad you actually got one of those, because if you didn't, you actually might... It might be like a dead run.
[80:52.08]Needing to drink like six times eventually, you might physically not be able to take more than like three hits.
[80:59.59]Yeah, it's been pretty bad.
[81:01.03]It's been pretty bad.
[81:02.52]But I make do.
[81:03.46]Item in the coffin.
[81:08.54]Ah, I didn't pick it up.
[81:09.22]I was too busy watching my favorite movie.
[81:23.23]Trolls roar.
[81:24.35]I feel like that's... I don't think I've seen that.
[81:30.00]It's fun, but bad.
[81:38.12]You know, I feel like that's the case with all FromSoftware games.
[81:41.12]Everything is fun but bad except for two things and they're the best thing.
[81:45.41]And don't ever use anything else.
[81:48.91]I just wish they made everything bad.
[81:50.99]Then you need to stop reading Reddit.
[82:05.77]true hey one person said true one person said true yeah because you didn't come up with that opinion yourself what I can't just agree with some things I can't I have to does every single opinion have to be a completely original opinion on something you can't just agree with something I mean
[82:31.16]What are you baiting me to jump off the cliff for?
[82:33.76]I'm just saying, like, you probably wouldn't have that opinion if everyone on Reddit didn't have the opinion that X thing is the good thing.
[82:41.97]Most people don't try all of the things and then they repeat the one thing that's good.
[82:45.13]And then once that thing gets nerfed, then someone goes, wait a second, this one other thing, that thing is also good.
[82:50.06]Let's all do that.
[82:50.80]And then that's the new thing.
[82:52.86]But it was always good.
[82:56.86]I would agree with you.
[82:59.11]But could you please use any of the crystal sorceries in the entire game?
[83:03.86]None of them are good.
[83:05.86]You know what I mean?
[83:08.02]Which ones?
[83:08.46]They're good, right?
[83:11.27]There's like... I don't... One?
[83:15.33]Which ones are the crystal ones?
[83:17.09]The ones that go like...
[83:20.63]The, like, machine gun ones?
[83:22.29]No, they're the purple crystal thing.
[83:24.29]Okay, glintstone is light blue, crystal is purple.
[83:27.05]The gravity purple ones?
[83:28.77]The purple shit sucks.
[83:32.55]Alright, well, I'm gonna... Okay, let me fucking put on a different spell real quick.
[83:35.95]And even glintstone.
[83:37.23]There's, like, a hundred glintstone moves, and honestly, there's maybe three or four of them that are, like, good.
[83:44.41]Like, good enough to, like, carry you through a playthrough.
[83:48.00]good enough to carry you so you're not good you need something good enough to carry you I saw all capitals wrong and then all capitals true right next to each other that's the worst take I'm I'm gonna disagree with you dude I used rain of stars and I was so excited about it and everyone omega lulled at me because they thought they were like dude you're an idiot that thing sucks and it was like one of the most expensive crystal spells in the whole game
[84:15.80]Every time I got a crystal move, I looked over and just saw, oh my god, Omega Law, that thing sucks, dude.
[84:22.60]Oh my god, that's one of the worst spells in the game.
[84:25.50]And I was like, okay.
[84:26.62]And I used it, and it did like 40 damage, and I was like, okay, that doesn't suck.
[84:31.02]So I never used it ever again.
[84:35.15]I'm not doing a Paul Bearer impression, was I?
[84:37.13]I think that's a very different take.
[84:41.11]some things are bad instead of there's one or two good things and only use those or you're bad.
[84:47.18]I think that's very different than like this one spell isn't good.
[84:53.34]Well, hold on.
[84:53.94]There's a difference between, like, everything is bad, so only use the good thing.
[84:58.17]Otherwise, like, everyone would have just used Rivers of Blood only.
[85:01.61]But, I mean, people kind of did that for a little while.
[85:04.45]But... Well, yeah, because people told them it was the only good thing for a while.
[85:08.47]That's all I'm saying is that it's... But if you went against Rivers of Blood, if you were talking about, like, a PvP scenario, you were automatically at a disadvantage.
[85:21.60]Got him.
[85:22.92]He's speechless.
[85:24.12]I mean, I don't know enough about the PvP and I don't think you did any PvP, so... I did a ton of PvP.
[85:30.75]Did you?
[85:33.37]I did, yeah.
[85:34.53]It sounds like you lost to a lot of people using Rivers of Blood.
[85:37.65]Oh, it'd be so easy if I just use that.
[85:39.47]But like, I don't want to because that's cheesy.
[85:40.99]So like, I'm not going to use it.
[85:41.93]I have no experience with how it actually is.
[85:43.41]But like, if if you use that, it's like so fucking lame.
[85:46.15]I lost to another rivers of blood user.
[85:48.05]I won't do it, though.
[85:48.94]I never said that.
[85:50.18]OK, you don't have to kind of writings on the wall.
[85:53.52]No, there's no writing on the wall.
[85:55.82]All I said is a lot of the stuff in this game is really fun to use.
[86:01.32]But no, no, no.
[86:01.82]Don't say Ster, like winning, Ster, like what a base take by Ster.
[86:06.34]No.
[86:06.88]If I'm the Reddit guy, if I'm the Reddit guy, you're the chat guy.
[86:11.22]You're the chat guy.
[86:12.62]I'm the chat guy?
[86:13.50]Yeah, you're the chat guy.
[86:14.20]If I'm the Reddit guy, you're the chat guy.
[86:16.82]What does that mean?
[86:18.10]Look over a chat and you're like, oh, that's what they're saying.
[86:20.32]Alright, I got it.
[86:23.27]They're the same guy.
[86:25.41]The Reddit guy and the chat guy are the same guy.
[86:41.86]Why are you so good at this?
[86:43.00]I fucking hate you.
[86:45.16]Okay.
[86:45.40]Alright.
[86:45.68]You ready?
[86:47.02]So good at what?
[86:47.88]I'm just like speaking common English.
[86:50.68]Why are you so good at this?
[86:52.94]Alright, where are we going?
[86:55.79]Oh, we missed a boss.
[86:56.41]That's right.
[86:57.13]Up to the village.
[86:57.61]It's too bad that move is not very good.
[87:09.09]Oh, hold on.
[87:11.72]Because I think I also have the moon staff.
[87:15.40]I forget which one does like bonus moon damage.
[87:21.71]That move actually is fantastic.
[87:22.99]I used it for almost the whole playthrough.
[87:26.27]That's the running moon one, right?
[87:28.71]Yeah.
[87:30.09]Rinala.
[87:31.57]Excuse me.
[87:33.75]Yeah, I have Carrion Regalceptor as the moon sorcery one.
[87:37.59]I upgraded my Carrion Glitstone to 15.
[87:41.81]How much intelligence do you have right now?
[87:45.29]Like... Enough.
[87:50.61]Doesn't that take like 70 to use?
[87:54.13]True.
[87:55.91]Another thing that my randomizer did is it made all the requirements zero on spells.
[88:01.08]Really?
[88:01.92]Yeah.
[88:03.18]Dude, your game is like so... My game's fucked up, dude.
[88:07.76]Hold on, it's zero?
[88:09.68]Yeah, everything is zero.
[88:12.02]I'm not using it, dude.
[88:14.30]You could.
[88:15.74]Like at this point, I would change it.
[88:19.29]But it would break everything and we'd have another like two hour delay.
[88:22.75]Nah, it's not worth it.
[88:24.23]Let's just have fun.
[88:24.77]We're having fun.
[88:33.57]You know, I'm not a fan.
[88:34.79]You know, if we're going to like change the topic of like, where's Hillary's emails right now?
[88:41.13]I don't like stat requirements on things.
[88:43.01]I'm not a fan.
[88:44.21]I actually like it.
[88:47.98]Let's go.
[88:48.36]You want to debate?
[88:50.84]You know what I love is that we both are really passionate about things that don't matter.
[88:54.96]They don't matter.
[88:55.55]They don't matter at all.
[88:56.57]I was thinking back to the conversation we had when we were playing Ember, where we just argued about Vampire Survivors for an hour.
[89:04.07]We both are always on the opposite side of the opinion.
[89:08.99]We both always disagree and are very passionate about something that does not matter at all.
[89:13.55]It's actually really funny.
[89:15.87]And then I thought today I was like, it's kind of weird, though, because if you ask us like what our favorite games are, we're both like Diablo two Bloodborne.
[89:22.64]Yeah.
[89:23.86]So we're like in total agreeance.
[89:26.02]We're also.
[89:28.42]We don't agree on anything.
[89:29.88]Did Yin and Yang have to exist?
[89:31.36]I'm sorry, but they do.
[89:36.34]The balance of the universe.
[89:46.71]He's got it right in the head.
[89:53.32]Here's the thing.
[89:53.70]The things that we don't agree on, like you said, are so meaningless that neither one of us could truly get upset by it.
[89:59.52]But also we're passionate enough to argue about it.
[90:02.78]But it's fun to talk.
[90:04.40]Yeah.
[90:09.84]We just annihilated that boss.
[90:14.21]Yep, he was nobody.
[90:15.99]Nobody and nothing.
[90:24.60]Are you suggesting the balance of the universe is being held up by YouTube bickering about video games?
[90:31.82]I don't know about you guys, but I feel like I'm the protagonist.
[90:35.63]And you're just like.
[90:37.47]NPCs in my world.
[90:40.19]You know what I you really might be the main character.
[90:45.59]I get a lot of... I feel like a lot of side character energy coming off of me.
[90:48.91]You know what I mean?
[90:49.51]I don't know.
[90:52.71]I think it goes back and forth, yin and yang.
[90:55.03]We're the two main characters, and we finally hook up in the end.
[90:58.04]But I feel like I'm not... Everyone just stops watching.
[90:59.94]I'm never a main character, but I feel like I end up being every single side character.
[91:03.98]Like, combined.
[91:07.80]The comic relief, like, joke character.
[91:10.38]Nah, I'm, like, smart.
[91:12.12]And I'm, like, kind of... There it is.
[91:15.89]There it is.
[91:21.83]Alright.
[91:22.45]I don't want to be the main character.
[91:23.57]That sounds like a lot of pressure and stress.
[91:25.25]The main character, all of their family, friends, and loved ones die.
[91:28.88]You don't want to be a main character.
[91:29.94]No, I don't want to be a main... Yeah, you really don't want to be a main character.
[91:32.60]You just want to be the chill buddy that, like, doesn't... Like, just kind of like, hey, happy to see you.
[91:38.62]Sorry, your family died.
[91:42.08]Don't worry, you'll get the Yakuza.
[91:43.76]And being the main character is like, in the middle of a conversation, it's like, oh yeah, blah, blah, blah.
[91:48.52]Every single other person is talking.
[91:49.92]Every character is talking.
[91:50.94]And then eventually they all kind of go like this.
[91:54.51]What do you have to say?
[91:56.09]Your main character?
[91:58.97]It's like, oh, um, well, I think that we should... Who did that?
[92:09.55]Come over here.
[92:13.72]And see, that's why full circle.
[92:16.98]That's why the Terraria playthrough makes sense.
[92:20.52]I was the protag.
[92:25.99]It all comes back to that.
[92:33.79]I want to be one of the guys that eats dinner at the table.
[92:36.25]I don't want to be the one that has to decide on what we're eating.
[92:42.69]Because if I have to decide on what we're eating, then you know there's gonna be three or four people at that table that are like... Steak and onions.
[92:49.26]I wouldn't have picked this.
[92:51.52]Whose decision was this?
[92:53.02]And then if you- I'm at the table too, and I'm just like, ah, it's... It's okay, I'm alright.
[92:57.29]I'm alright.
[92:58.59]It's alright.
[92:59.43]I am, yeah.
[93:00.71]Yeah, I don't want to be the person that's like, hey, so... You were the one that ordered the lasagna for the table?
[93:09.01]Yeah, I like lasagna.
[93:11.63]I don't fucking like lasagna.
[93:13.49]Well, I just figured we would all eat it because it's pasta and sauce and it's... You don't want to be at fault.
[93:19.81]No, I just don't want to make decisions for anybody.
[93:22.55]I don't want to be the main character.
[93:30.12]Oh, so like early on in this run when I was like, which direction do you want to go?
[93:32.86]Where do you want to go?
[93:34.84]That was upsetting.
[93:36.22]Scrambled eggs and pork chops are not good.
[93:41.25]like that's the decision I would make.
[93:42.80]That sounds pretty good.
[93:47.46]I like making decisions on things that I very much know a lot about.
[93:51.66]Does that make sense?
[93:54.94]I'm okay with being the main character in some very, very specific places.
[93:59.20]But that's it.
[94:00.28]That's it.
[94:02.42]Don't ask me where we should eat.
[94:04.70]Don't ask me about anything else.
[94:07.54]What do I ask you about?
[94:10.43]um something like making like videos well I don't know like I don't know like doing like streams like event streams I know that I know that very well you got an event talk to me talk to me stepped on the thing
[94:34.45]You want to know where we're going to go for food?
[94:35.98]Don't call me.
[94:37.96]You want my opinion on any other thing?
[94:40.44]You want my opinion on literally any other subject?
[94:42.68]Don't talk to me.
[94:44.50]My game might have crashed.
[94:45.74]Yeah, my game crashed.
[94:50.93]Only talk to me about my hyper fixation.
[94:55.19]You want to talk to me about like cereal mascots?
[95:03.72]did you actually crash I did yeah are you dead no I'm just laughing at what you said okay that was I thought that was the Jerma classic I've done something dumb and I don't want him to know laugh but that blended into the I don't know learn I'm relearning the styles I'm all around though like all jokes aside
[95:30.00]It's... I make decisions on a lot of things.
[95:32.21]It's just not... I'd rather be somebody that contributes.
[95:38.89]I'm summoning.
[95:39.33]I put the thing down.
[95:40.55]I respawned in the same spot where I crashed.
[95:42.43]Kind of.
[95:56.27]But I do have a couple, like you said, whatever my things that I really care about.
[96:00.92]I will take the helm on it.
[96:02.48]I will.
[96:19.47]Drive the clown car until it stops working.
[96:22.02]Yeah.
[96:25.87]Anyways, where on crystal do I go to get a couple of people to wrestle each other?
[96:30.30]Anyways, the crystal abilities in this game are not good.
[96:34.44]Full circle.
[96:37.36]Is that full circle?
[96:38.24]Because you're kind of taking the wheel and saying that they're not good, but also like you don't really know.
[96:43.42]I'm just, you know, I'm trying to make a joke.
[96:48.68]It's not funny to me, dude.
[96:50.00]Maybe I'm not laughing.
[96:56.31]Oh, dude, there's a rock, a cool rock in here.
[97:01.26]Honestly, I would have put that rock in this chest.
[97:06.06]Some of this, like, cool, shiny rocks, don't you think that's what would be in a chest?
[97:10.78]So, like, in front of the goddess, like, offering statue, I'm going to give him a rock.
[97:18.11]You're cursed for the rest of your life.
[97:22.44]What was in yours?
[97:24.60]Smoldering butterfly.
[97:26.81]Is that better?
[97:27.29]I mean, it could have some form of like religious, like, but a rock.
[97:34.02]A special rock cannot have that?
[97:38.02]Was it a special rock or a rock?
[97:40.20]New topic.
[97:40.98]Let's go.
[97:51.73]uh do you care about the dragon abilities I wish I did because the I I could get like the dragon communion seal and I've been I already have like a flame breath but no because I doing faith I can't drop them anyways never mind oh yeah I found like a whole bunch of the fire magic
[98:17.95]I kind of.
[98:19.71]You know, don't know where we're going.
[98:21.87]Collecting items, some of these categories should be like a boss down here.
[98:25.15]Yeah, I think we opened the door down here somewhere.
[98:32.72]Try finger.
[98:36.04]But what about what was it done?
[98:46.44]Was there nothing else in here?
[98:52.47]No.
[98:56.85]Unless there's another illusory wall.
[98:59.13]I don't think there is here.
[99:06.20]Nope.
[99:09.78]Look at my lantern.
[99:12.66]It's kind of bright.
[99:16.83]It was behind you.
[99:17.95]That guy said that and it's like watching the stream on a delay.
[99:22.20]And I'm on a delay.
[99:23.06]You're kind of describing the problem I was having earlier where I asked too many questions in a row and it was getting answers for the out of order.
[99:49.19]Yeah, what's going on here?
[99:52.67]This is the entrance.
[99:54.40]You pulled the big heavy door lever.
[100:01.44]You guys having a good time?
[100:02.12]Okay.
[100:08.45]Somewhere a heavy door has opened.
[100:11.97]Oh, I think maybe because of the desync.
[100:13.99]Oh, come here.
[100:14.69]Oh, wait, when you crashed.
[100:16.95]I think we never pulled that.
[100:19.43]Oh, because when you crashed out, it doesn't count technically, right?
[100:22.88]Yeah, come back up here.
[100:26.82]Up to the beginning?
[100:28.34]Yeah.
[100:30.26]I don't think we've been down here.
[100:33.48]Nope.
[100:37.89]Nothing in there.
[100:40.83]There's a heavy door somewhere.
[100:42.51]Hey, we're coming down these stairs.
[100:44.55]What?
[100:45.85]Sorry, I was when you when I was looking at chat.
[100:48.90]I'm sorry I asked him a question.
[100:51.98]Frozen lightning spear.
[100:55.36]I got a spear too.
[100:57.00]No, like the magic frozen lightning spear.
[101:00.86]Oh, I you don't care about faith, right?
[101:03.56]Because I did get lightning spear.
[101:05.04]Dude, if we kill Rinala, I might go like faith because I have so much faith stuff.
[101:13.09]Bills are losing.
[101:15.60]Oh no.
[101:23.46]Not my bills.
[101:24.12]Come on.
[101:35.16]Got him.
[101:39.66]It's a big windup.
[101:53.77]There's something weird about fighting a boss that's not actually attacking you.
[101:57.71]Trying to gauge how close you are.
[102:10.31]I forgot he did that.
[102:12.00]Please don't kill me.
[102:25.16]There's no way we can do this.
[102:35.85]Dude, I'm sick of seeing these cookbooks.
[102:40.35]At some point, you're going to get every single cookbook.
[102:44.30]And then you're going to get some cool stuff.
[102:48.58]let him cook we still don't have we don't have the crafting thing to craft or cook there's no cooking going on common bills l I guess they're are they playing right now alright how are you doing you leveling up I actually think I might be able to as well
[103:20.89]It's going to be close.
[103:24.91]17, 18,000.
[103:24.95]I think it's 18.
[103:26.95]Or 19.
[103:27.11]Shit.
[103:28.59]It's okay.
[103:45.86]What's my favorite vegetable to dice?
[103:47.90]Onions.
[103:48.24]Come on.
[103:53.11]Aster, what's your favorite topping to go on a hot dog?
[103:55.75]I'll go first.
[103:58.27]Mine is diced onions.
[104:00.13]I feel like you take control of this conversation at this point, and I don't even get to answer.
[104:04.19]What's your favorite?
[104:04.91]By the way, mine is, and you just keep talking, and then, like, don't even care.
[104:09.51]What is it, though?
[104:11.50]No, what was yours?
[104:12.24]Yours first.
[104:13.08]Yours was... Diced onions.
[104:17.56]Cold, not grilled.
[104:18.98]Diced onions.
[104:21.08]And maybe a little bit of Tabasco.
[104:24.17]And maybe, maybe, maybe a little mustard if I feel like it.
[104:29.00]I would usually say like, I don't think opinions can be wrong, but that was fucked up what you just said.
[104:38.11]Why?
[104:38.33]What about just Tabasco on a hot dog or Tabasco and ketchup?
[104:45.52]I don't know.
[104:45.82]I like never have Tabasco at all.
[104:51.36]You know what's really good?
[104:54.70]Like pineapple.
[104:56.60]Iced up pineapple.
[104:58.67]I think I would, if I had my choice of like the perfect well-made dog, it would be like chili.
[105:05.43]That's good.
[105:07.03]Because I love Sonic.
[105:10.56]The Hedgehog.
[105:12.78]He loves chili cheese dogs, I think.
[105:15.70]Yeah.
[105:16.52]Oh, we're in.
[105:16.94]I didn't even see it change.
[105:17.78]I'm...
[105:22.81]This guy's pretty easy.
[105:24.79]What's normally even in these?
[105:26.05]We've actually gotten pretty lucky on these.
[105:27.41]They're not bad at all.
[105:54.14]Please, let me cast something!
[105:55.51]Please, let me do something!
[105:56.71]God, I'm gonna re-roll!
[105:58.29]What the- WHAT THE FUCK?!
[105:59.43]Okay, and he just smashed his controller down.
[106:01.07]He just threw his controller on the- into, like, the desk.
[106:04.03]I got a death root.
[106:12.78]I got... literal shit.
[106:26.85]Do you think it's time to attempt the wall?
[106:32.96]The wall?
[106:34.10]I think we might be able to attempt the real wall of the playthrough.
[106:39.66]I feel like we're pretty strong.
[106:40.59]I think we can.
[106:41.25]I want to finish going up left here.
[106:45.17]This is the teleport towers.
[106:49.74]Get to the end of this path and then we'll go fight Placidusax, the Queen of the Moon.
[106:54.84]And then followed by Loretta.
[106:57.02]Immediately after.
[107:09.14]Pineapple... Very, very small pineapple chunks.
[107:12.84]Not big rings or anything.
[107:14.34]Not like big chunks.
[107:15.24]Little pineapple chunks.
[107:16.12]Part of like a... Almost like a...
[107:19.83]Like, oh, man, there used to be this place in New Jersey where it all began.
[107:25.41]It was like they would make like icees, like Italian ices, but they would put like the chunks of the fruit in it and they had like a pineapple pina colada chunks of pineapple in it.
[107:39.17]Truly.
[107:41.10]one of the goats hot dogs are it's weirdly enough hot dogs are one of the only foods that wacky combinations I accept them and want them I don't know what it is about hot dogs but I think it's just hot dogs are just like oh it's a bunch of just random ass meat it's okay how disgusting is a hot dog to you if it has no bun and no no toppings no that that's fine for me really I I if I take like one bite I'm like I'm done
[108:07.83]Well, that was, that was enough.
[108:09.53]You just mean like just a hot dog with not, but do you put it at like hot dogs and beans or hot dogs and anything else?
[108:15.11]No, just a hot, a hot dog.
[108:17.01]Like if I hand you a cooked hot dog and I'm like, eat this, can you finish it?
[108:22.00]Yeah, I would.
[108:22.52]I'd be able to.
[108:24.38]It's like same thing with bananas.
[108:26.12]Like a whole banana, like bananas are too big.
[108:28.66]Let's be honest.
[108:29.22]Trees.
[108:29.52]What are you up to?
[108:30.34]Why is it that big?
[108:33.71]Do you want to use one of these?
[108:34.67]Do we even have one of these?
[108:35.91]We don't, but there's like a bonfire up here.
[108:37.73]I just want to get it.
[108:39.91]I think there's a chest on the top one.
[108:44.76]It's so funny how much people just flip on us this whole stream.
[108:50.78]Everyone was saying Jerma L, like super Jerma L. Now everyone's saying Ster L. Wow.
[108:56.18]Common Ster L.
[108:58.13]a hot dog without a bun and you're just like yeah I want to suck it straight down I don't even chew them well we're not doing like the I I can shoot him like this we're not doing that like meme video I'm just saying okay and again it's not we're not talking like a sausage it's not like a cheese filled it's not it's like a just basic ass beef hot dog
[109:23.22]I mean, I would not prefer it, but I... Okay, if somebody was like, hey, well, how many times have you been in this scenario before?
[109:30.35]Where you're at a barbecue, or you're at a grill, like a family get-together, friend get-together, whatever it is.
[109:34.63]And, oh, hey, there's one or two hot dogs just left on the grill.
[109:39.61]And there's no buns.
[109:41.75]It's too much time, too much effort to go through that.
[109:44.37]That is an actual impossibility for me to eat those.
[109:48.12]Like a hot dog without a bun, they kind of gross me out.
[109:51.20]A hot dog with even a normal loaf of bread slice, amazing.
[109:59.34]There's an on and off switch there for me.
[110:01.06]There's never been a scenario where you're just like, okay, there's a couple hot dogs left.
[110:04.90]I could still probably eat one, but I don't really care.
[110:07.65]It's a grilled hot dog.
[110:08.75]Yeah, give it to me.
[110:09.69]I'll eat it in three bites.
[110:11.37]Easy.
[110:11.55]No, can't do it.
[110:13.03]I would feel like throwing up.
[110:14.35]Okay.
[110:17.75]Yeah.
[110:20.58]I don't prefer it, but I would eat it.
[110:29.88]Especially if it's grilled.
[110:30.68]If it's grilled, that takes it up a couple tiers, I think, for me wanting to be able to do what we're talking about.
[110:35.06]Hey, you know, no one's perfect.
[110:40.21]What was your take about bananas?
[110:43.93]Oh, it's like the same thing.
[110:45.05]Like, bananas are too big.
[110:46.76]I'll eat like a big banana.
[110:48.79]I'll eat half of it and like that's enough.
[110:51.66]That's enough banana, right?
[110:54.50]Can I change your whole life?
[110:57.12]Sure.
[110:57.58]Okay.
[110:59.03]Change my life, Jerma.
[111:00.73]Do you... You're a smoothie fan, right?
[111:05.25]Yeah, you are.
[111:05.69]Yeah.
[111:07.23]Are you, like, a banana smoothie fan?
[111:10.41]Yeah.
[111:11.05]Yeah, you are.
[111:11.87]But what I would do is I would, like, cut the banana in half, put half the banana in, freeze the rest.
[111:19.32]And then, like, the next time you have a smoothie, you have, like, frozen banana.
[111:22.74]Yeah, but
[111:24.25]how much banana what kind of banana are you doing strawberry my game crashed oh strawberry banana is good yeah strawberry uh or blueberry uh hopefully that didn't am I still yeah I'm still alive okay um yeah so strawberry banana strawberry do you do peanut butter banana
[111:46.19]peanut butter no I had it once and it kind of grossed me out but I also feel like I could come around to the peanut butter banana situation I think that's you just you need to get the ratio right a lot of people when they make a peanut butter banana smoothie they make a huge mistake and they add just a shitload of peanut butter and it becomes this thick peanut butter shake light peanut butter extra banana there's your there's the correct ratio you want less peanut butter versus banana for me
[112:15.75]You know what?
[112:16.17]Maybe, maybe this changes my life.
[112:17.78]Maybe it doesn't, but I'll try it.
[112:22.90]Because I think my first experience with the peanut butter banana phenomena, like I ordered a smoothie and was not expecting it.
[112:30.66]Like I didn't even know.
[112:32.71]And then I tasted it and was like, and let me guess, it was like, how dare you?
[112:36.33]It was like, how dare you?
[112:37.95]Did you have to like kind of tip it back?
[112:39.37]And it was like, like it was like sludge almost, right?
[112:43.62]A little bit.
[112:44.28]That's what I'm saying.
[112:45.58]Oh, through a straw.
[112:46.44]It's like... Do I gotta re-invite you or something?
[112:49.88]Yeah, I think you probably have to put a new thing down.
[112:51.86]I'm gonna use the banishing ball.
[112:55.14]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[112:56.86]Here's the straw.
[112:58.36]Peanut butter banana smoothie.
[113:03.18]Okay.
[113:04.18]Peanut butter, right?
[113:07.29]That was a pretty bad sound.
[113:10.95]Are you still trying to make more?
[113:13.41]No, I'm not farming.
[113:15.31]Are you trying to make more sound effects?
[113:18.55]I don't know if it really should count as a category if you're just like intentionally farming it.
[113:23.63]I have to read this.
[113:27.87]But no, I don't.
[113:28.97]It was so stupid, but I'm going to read it because it's like it's contextually funny.
[113:35.15]Uh, but no, I'm not going to read it.
[113:37.10]I've already said it, so I have to read it.
[113:38.56]Oh my, you have to now.
[113:40.34]Somebody said, bro, it's not, your suck game is just really bad.
[113:43.69]No, it's possible.
[113:51.45]I wouldn't want to rule anything out.
[113:52.97]It's a scientific method.
[113:54.53]You don't want it to be... No, alright.
[113:56.93]Alright, first attempt.
[113:57.87]Focus, focus, focus up.
[113:59.95]Or maybe don't focus.
[114:01.01]We've been doing pretty well just rambling.
[114:02.81]Yeah, when we don't focus.
[114:03.47]Don't get hit by the lightning.
[114:04.69]Three lightnings.
[114:05.27]I ain't gonna get hit by... Whoa, that was different.
[114:11.14]Alright, Placidusax.
[114:14.85]I'm doing so much more damage.
[114:17.69]Oh, my God.
[114:18.39]Alright.
[114:20.07]I took a hit, but you know what?
[114:21.19]Who gives a shit?
[114:25.11]Quick, quick.
[114:25.57]Talk about onions or something.
[114:28.98]So my favorite thing about onions is the way they make you cry.
[114:58.88]Just honest.
[114:59.48]This felt so fucking easy, dude.
[115:02.24]Don't say that now.
[115:06.52]You said that instead of talking about like something dumb and goofy.
[115:10.07]And now look what happened.
[115:15.97]I got like games laggy.
[115:22.78]That shouldn't have exploded on me.
[115:23.98]This game's fucking broken.
[115:27.02]My game's broke.
[115:27.58]It's a broken game.
[115:36.23]Where is he?
[115:44.19]Where?
[115:44.41]Okay.
[115:44.99]It's playing hard to get.
[115:49.63]Behind you.
[115:52.78]How did that miss?
[115:53.58]Lasers!
[115:55.22]No, it's the fire.
[116:03.05]Watch the tail swipe.
[116:17.29]He's stuck up there, and he's doing lasers up there.
[116:20.36]This could ruin the whole thing.
[116:22.85]I don't even see it.
[116:23.65]He's stuck inside of the... I don't know how we're going to do this.
[116:27.21]He'll come down eventually.
[116:28.33]I might even be able to... No, my pebbles don't go far enough.
[116:32.76]He's inside of the wall.
[116:34.94]Oh, that's too bad.
[116:35.70]We could have just cheesed him.
[116:40.68]Thank God.
[116:41.10]Alright.
[116:50.03]Blazers!
[117:01.20]my eyes alright focus up focus focus focus on the prize we're at um this is it it shouldn't be too bad it really shouldn't skipping
[117:47.32]Spammer.
[117:47.74]Remember, forward.
[118:00.21]Dodge forward on those.
[118:13.04]Ow!
[118:14.02]Damn, he got you good.
[118:17.67]Oh my goodness.
[118:18.43]That was weird.
[118:33.32]Oh.
[118:36.28]Alright, here comes second phase.
[118:42.09]I'm out of heal.
[118:47.28]Just play defensive if you have to.
[118:58.61]I hate to be weird and or cringe.
[119:00.87]I have never fought this boss.
[119:04.79]Uh-oh.
[119:06.86]I don't know the second phase.
[119:11.80]That one I question.
[119:12.98]I'm confused on that one.
[119:15.77]I'm pretty sure there's a speed run skip.
[119:19.15]I learned it and I just skipped the box.
[119:23.61]Oh, wait.
[119:23.97]No, no.
[119:24.46]By the time you fight this boss, you're so powerful that I actually won like Stunlocked Insta-phased it every time I fought it.
[119:31.70]I have fought this boss, but I haven't seen like... I didn't know there was even a second phase.
[119:37.56]It's kind of more what's getting me.
[119:44.41]Alright, we got, we got it.
[119:45.59]We're good.
[119:47.21]Nice.
[119:47.45]I got, we actually got some, I got a lot of shit.
[120:01.25]I think I got one of the full medallions.
[120:06.13]I have a sacred tear as well.
[120:08.07]I don't know if that was from earlier.
[120:10.81]That's a big deal.
[120:18.16]Okay.
[120:21.99]I like this weapon.
[120:24.19]I like the thing it's doing.
[120:25.17]Yeah, but I don't want a blood weapon.
[120:39.70]I'm honestly debating if I should switch to faith because I have so much good faith stuff.
[120:45.49]This is the opportunity for us to both go, what do we actually want to do?
[120:53.07]I guess if I do strength, I mean, if I'm going to have like 50 points in strength anyways, then this thing's, I could still use this if I wanted to.
[121:11.00]This thing is cool.
[121:15.34]What are my options?
[121:16.58]My actual options?
[121:21.54]This is regular smithing stones.
[121:22.76]This is somber.
[121:23.94]This is somber, but this is faith.
[121:31.63]I like having one of each type of stone.
[121:34.83]Oh, I have the rolled medallion for the grand lift of rolled.
[121:38.19]I have it fully completed.
[121:40.61]So we can do that at some point.
[121:49.23]I'll do these two.
[121:50.83]So I need to make... I need 16 int, 50 strength.
[121:55.93]And then... This just scales off of strength.
[121:59.43]And I'll be good to go.
[122:02.46]I want to see what this weapon art is.
[122:09.18]What about the God Slayer?
[122:12.50]Are you going Faith?
[122:13.39]Because we shouldn't do the same thing.
[122:16.77]I really want to use sorceries.
[122:18.54]I'm thinking I'm not switching.
[122:21.54]I have a lot of good stuff I could do if I did switch, but I really don't actually want to.
[122:28.81]So if you do.
[122:29.97]OK.
[122:34.79]Now it's coming down to.
[122:37.95]Coming down to aesthetics now for me.
[122:42.78]Cool.
[122:46.98]This thing you raise up and you smash it and fire comes out, right?
[122:53.14]What?
[122:54.38]This sword.
[122:54.72]It's like the Magma Wyrm sword.
[122:56.64]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[123:01.27]Yeah.
[123:08.71]This thing is really, really cool looking.
[123:18.34]Damn, this thing is pretty sick.
[123:25.00]I don't know.
[123:26.28]Swing it.
[123:27.60]We need to leave this area.
[123:31.65]The God Slayer is dex.
[123:33.51]Is it?
[123:40.93]This is pretty fast for this kind of weapon.
[123:44.68]I can't remember if this is good or super bad.
[123:47.18]The Rotten Crystal Sword builds up Scarlet Rot.
[123:52.57]I can't remember if Scarlet Rot actually matters against bosses and things.
[123:55.81]It does.
[123:57.53]If you get Scarlet Rot on a boss, it takes a ton of damage away, especially if they're susceptible to it.
[124:06.03]Decks and... Yeah, this is a lot of decks.
[124:21.24]I'm looking at you really weirdly, but you know what I mean?
[124:25.70]You're looking at me weirdly?
[124:27.12]No, I looked at the camera directly into it, kind of like a weirdo.
[124:36.07]No, this is annoying.
[124:37.67]I think I've made my decision.
[124:40.32]Let's go to the blacksmith.
[124:54.84]I think I've made my decision.
[124:55.78]Yeah, hold on.
[125:00.74]Let me go back.
[125:01.60]Blacksmith, he said.
[125:02.94]Yeah.
[125:04.34]Unless you're respecting like right now and you're sure of it.
[125:07.54]No, you could do that first.
[125:14.77]Yes, I am.
[125:16.07]Alright, so I'm going to be using the Magma Wyrm scale sword.
[125:19.55]That's the weapon I'm choosing for the remainder of our run.
[125:23.19]You're going like full strength attacky man.
[125:25.87]I'm just going full super strength with a little bit of faith.
[125:30.91]To be able to use the magma guillotine ability.
[125:34.94]Oh, kind of.
[125:35.52]It kind of does make me actually want to go like fire caster and then we could be like the magma brothers.
[125:42.30]Yeah, that'd be cool.
[125:43.28]The only problem is what if we find somebody that's immune?
[125:45.28]Alright, let's do this.
[125:48.67]Yeah, when Lister the tormentor accidentally like just rolls immune to fire.
[125:53.47]He's like, dude, come on.
[125:54.87]I'm a fucking meteor build.
[125:58.39]Okay, so let's get... How much I should have at least... What?
[126:02.07]Yeah, you are saying a bunch of stuff that I, like, know.
[126:05.74]Okay.
[126:06.32]Okay.
[126:12.76]Okay, you are saying things that I know.
[126:15.10]That's great.
[126:16.96]Cool.
[126:17.63]I like that.
[126:18.95]That's crazy.
[126:22.31]Oh, man, man, that's crazy.
[126:24.07]Let me look over my shit if I actually did a switcheroo.
[126:31.11]I need 15 decks to put this on.
[126:35.86]And then how much?
[126:36.38]No, this doesn't tell.
[126:37.18]How much faith do I need?
[126:42.48]Here.
[126:43.40]Here's what's going to happen.
[126:45.26]I'm banishing you.
[126:46.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[126:47.02]Don't do that yet.
[126:48.99]Okay.
[126:49.11]Okay.
[126:52.29]Whenever we're going to have like a resource management session, I think we should just like banish so we can go to Roundtable Hold.
[127:44.08]Alright.
[127:45.36]I now... Yep.
[127:50.91]Let's see.
[127:51.23]I don't think I've ever seen this weapon's move before.
[127:55.01]I feel like I have.
[127:56.73]Why would I know what it is?
[128:04.58]Well, that's fucking cool.
[128:07.70]It stays there.
[128:11.14]That's a great initiator.
[128:17.50]Watch this.
[128:17.88]Look what I can do now.
[128:22.31]Yeah, you do that in real life, you would die.
[128:24.01]That's not realistic at all.
[128:25.83]The lava would burn you.
[128:30.29]Yeah, that's right.
[128:31.17]That's true.
[128:31.69]I shouldn't like that.
[128:33.71]I shouldn't enjoy that anymore.
[128:34.88]Yeah, you're right.
[128:37.98]What should I like?
[128:40.06]Tell me what I should like then.
[128:41.64]What you should like?
[128:42.96]Yeah, because that's not realistic and stupid.
[128:45.10]Tell me what I should like.
[128:47.42]No, you can like it, but it's not realistic.
[128:50.52]Oh.
[128:50.68]Alright, do you want to like disconnect from each other and just upgrade and stuff and then get back to it?
[128:58.53]Or what do you want to do?
[128:59.71]Are you... Did you respec?
[129:00.87]Uh, no, I didn't.
[129:06.25]Well, go do what you need to do.
[129:14.25]The jumping R2 has...
[129:16.87]wide range I think a wide kind of area it has a follow-up yeah whoa it does it's that move that the Magma Wyrm does that's cool
[129:48.42]Alright, how much can I upgrade this?
[130:00.71]It does a lot of damage.
[130:01.75]Good.
[130:03.25]I don't know.
[130:09.01]Okay, I need Somber Smithing Stone 5.
[130:15.13]That's the hang up here.
[130:19.12]Um, yeah, I don't have that either.
[130:20.80]Yeah.
[130:21.88]I'll double check.
[130:26.44]I don't.
[130:28.46]This is still, I think, technically better, right?
[130:30.16]Because it has the separate fire damage.
[130:37.23]Maybe the ball bearings?
[130:38.01]Maybe.
[130:38.23]Okay.
[130:44.83]Okay.
[130:47.22]Now for the remainder of this, do I put any more points in Faith?
[130:52.22]Or should I just start dumping stuff in, um... No?
[131:02.33]Just dumping into Vigor?
[131:11.69]Or Endurance, probably.
[131:16.74]I'll get bigger to 30.
[131:25.94]Now does that show up?
[131:27.60]So what's your plan?
[131:28.58]Tell us.
[131:29.04]We're dying to know.
[131:33.34]Wait, what?
[131:34.28]What's your plan here?
[131:35.06]What weapon are you trying to look at?
[131:37.32]What's your strategy?
[131:38.72]I think I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.
[131:44.86]Just kind of looking around what the shops are selling.
[132:00.47]This is a great weapon.
[132:03.68]I think I should buy this.
[132:11.74]This too.
[132:26.66]You might as well just buy... Make sure you... In the shop, make sure you're buying the flask stuff.
[132:33.66]It's showing up randomly in shops for me.
[132:35.08]Yeah, our shops are different.
[132:38.45]Yeah, but just in case they're showing up in yours too.
[132:41.07]If I see an item in a shop that's good, I will buy it.
[132:48.25]This one's D. Okay.
[133:12.42]Okay, what we got?
[133:13.08]This is pretty standard.
[133:25.67]Is this the same guy that growled at us and turned purple?
[133:36.35]Yeah.
[133:38.69]is I can't deny that if I would just if I was if I said no no I didn't do that you'd be like what are you talking about I am the guy that growled at somebody in chat and my face turned purple it's this video evidence of this happening so I can't say it didn't happen I can't say that it didn't happen
[134:13.46]You could have just not read that.
[134:15.26]Yeah, but it's fun to read chat.
[134:17.14]I like reading just random chat messages.
[134:19.42]It's fun.
[134:23.41]Obviously, if it's like a fun comment, right?
[134:26.55]Okay.
[134:37.65]I am officially ready to continue whenever you are.
[134:42.21]I need a moment.
[134:43.17]I killed D. Well, you killed him?
[134:48.81]One of the merchants had his quest item, and then he dies.
[134:51.69]Or was that Roger?
[134:53.07]I don't know.
[134:53.79]And then Thea, like, vanished.
[134:57.72]Who knows how these quests work?
[134:58.96]It's actually so cool that you don't know any of this.
[135:04.36]I, like, vaguely know...
[135:10.40]almost everything but like vaguely what is this clip everyone's linking that art no into vigor just dumping into into vigor that sir was making a sound effect he was just
[135:32.42]no no Ster did you or did you not like a few minutes ago go like like you pressed your lips together and did like a kind of like an elephant sound there it is I'm sorry see they thought you farted yeah they thought I farted when you did that see no sometimes when I'm lifting weights I do that by accident and my wife laughs at me
[135:57.35]You gotta breathe, man.
[135:59.33]Well, like, no, you gotta brace.
[136:01.95]I know.
[136:02.67]Then you, like, the air releases and you elephant a little bit.
[136:10.00]Stop replaying it.
[136:10.78]It's gross.
[136:11.46]It's not real.
[136:12.44]Alright.
[136:13.94]It's not real.
[136:15.42]I need to jump.
[136:17.80]What should I do?
[136:18.84]You know, I know what I'm gonna do.
[136:21.48]Oh, the crafting isn't random.
[136:29.00]I know exactly what I'm going to do.
[136:31.90]Where is it?
[136:34.24]Is it not open yet?
[136:34.88]Where's that room chat?
[136:36.42]There it is.
[136:37.14]Okay.
[136:37.70]Do you have any Smithing 7s?
[136:40.03]Just regular ones?
[136:41.13]Yeah.
[136:44.05]I do not.
[136:46.11]Okay.
[136:46.73]Once I get some 7s, I'm going to fully unleash.
[136:52.41]I feel like you probably are.
[137:13.09]I'm good.
[137:15.59]I guess I'm ready.
[137:16.35]I don't know.
[137:16.81]I didn't really do anything.
[137:19.58]If you want to just dump some of your stone.
[137:21.94]Do you have any stone sword keys?
[137:24.10]I do.
[137:24.74]Bottom.
[137:26.60]Down in the basement.
[137:27.22]Well, we shouldn't have to use both.
[137:29.52]If you are.
[137:30.04]Have you already used yours?
[137:31.58]I just opened the chest down here.
[137:35.18]At the round table in the basement.
[137:36.70]There's the two.
[137:37.24]What I mean is like you should have been in.
[137:38.98]We should have been together when you did that.
[137:48.22]your favorite kind of onion uh I don't know I can't really tell the difference there's always like white onion yellow I can't I don't really I can't really tell yeah it's kind of tricky sometimes red onions yeah not a big no no I'll go yellow onion the yeah like the purple onion whatever it is right I want just yo um
[138:18.59]You ready?
[138:19.93]Yeah, I'm ready.
[138:21.93]You see what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to invite you to my game.
[138:25.57]How do I donate?
[138:26.75]Don't.
[138:28.93]Wow.
[138:31.33]You're going to come to my game and then I'm going to give the death fruit to the guy because he's going to give us an item and I want us both to get it.
[138:37.48]Okay.
[138:38.96]Is your thing done?
[138:40.26]Yeah.
[138:46.92]I'm coming in.
[138:56.94]What's wrong?
[138:57.94]The way I'm walking.
[138:58.88]I've actually been walking like this, so it's extra funny to me.
[139:03.02]French onion soup is good.
[139:04.64]You got to be in the mood for French onion soup because it's just kind of salt.
[139:08.89]It's just a very salty flavor.
[139:10.41]It's very good flavor, but it's very salty.
[139:13.79]Alright.
[139:17.45]Ready?
[139:17.87]R1, R1, R1, R1.
[139:23.88]Was it worth it?
[139:25.56]No, nothing.
[139:25.88]I didn't get anything.
[139:27.59]Oh, I thought you would get it.
[139:30.11]Your theory was very sound in a lot of different potential hypotheses.
[139:35.30]Let's kill this boat guy.
[139:36.28]We've probably got the damage now.
[139:37.52]Yeah, we do.
[139:37.76]Does he have more health than he's had before?
[139:50.76]He had a lot before.
[139:53.40]Oh, my God.
[139:53.92]We are doing thousands of damage to him.
[140:05.95]Did he scale higher or something for some reason?
[140:09.01]No, this is about... This makes sense.
[140:11.58]Does it?
[140:12.10]I feel like he doesn't have this much HP.
[140:18.56]That didn't even do that much.
[140:23.02]And yes, he absolutely did.
[140:24.82]Did he?
[140:26.88]Watch out!
[140:27.50]Skeleton!
[140:32.40]I know you've heard me say this a few times, but now I'm not even going to say it.
[140:47.01]Alright.
[140:47.59]But are you absorbed?
[140:49.43]Look, we're concentrating.
[140:51.69]I can't speak.
[140:53.65]Am I being absorbed?
[140:55.83]Remember when I was like, oh, no, I'm not going to say it.
[140:59.02]I can't say it.
[140:59.54]And you're like, yeah, now you have to, though.
[141:03.02]No, I realized also what I was going to say was like factually incorrect.
[141:08.21]And I didn't want to be spreading misinformation.
[141:10.67]It's good of you.
[141:13.13]On the internet.
[141:14.21]It's good of you.
[141:14.67]Yeah, I try.
[141:28.62]Is there?
[141:28.88]Oh, yeah, there is a backstab you can do.
[141:31.37]Oh, no, I thought you just did it.
[141:33.23]No, there is.
[141:33.81]I'm pretty sure there is, but I didn't do it.
[141:35.99]That's my Glintstone special.
[141:51.48]Maybe not.
[141:52.50]I don't think so.
[141:58.83]Use your weapon art.
[142:00.11]I have no FB.
[142:00.97]Does it use FB?
[142:04.20]Probably.
[142:04.68]Yeah, it does.
[142:09.16]It's a good thing he only summoned the skeleton for like one attack.
[142:13.64]Yeah.
[142:14.62]88,000 souls, dude.
[142:15.62]What is going on right now?
[142:19.01]He's a pretty... I mean, that was more than Radon's memory.
[142:25.63]Let's come in here and level up.
[142:27.09]Holy shit.
[142:42.28]That guy was rich.
[142:48.36]I feel like that's the safe thing to do.
[142:49.64]But this is the thing I want to do.
[142:56.67]I think that... Let's do safe.
[142:59.73]20 endurance.
[143:00.71]Get to 30 vigor and be good to go.
[143:04.57]And then... Let's play safe.
[143:08.11]Let's do it safe.
[143:09.59]Let's do safe.
[143:22.36]okay well that was a big deal um I don't know if you want to fight stuff here this is kind of like you know the logical place to go is up over to plateau
[143:41.16]We could just stay.
[143:42.12]I mean, this is... I think I have the teleporter that goes to... Wait, I don't?
[143:47.56]No, Southern Caled is where we need to be.
[143:49.52]We need to kill Redan.
[143:52.25]Oh, that stinks.
[143:55.21]Yeah, I should have... I don't know why I don't.
[143:59.03]I ran all the way and got the Redan waypoint and I don't have it.
[144:04.74]I want to go fight Redan just to see like... It's going to be like a random guy in the middle of the desert.
[144:10.49]That's right.
[144:11.17]Why am I concerned about this?
[144:12.63]Alright, let's... Inner Ionia is the closest I've got.
[144:17.74]Really?
[144:19.10]You don't have the under stairs or the... Oh, no, that's... Yeah, I know what you mean.
[144:25.64]Redan's not active yet.
[144:29.69]Oh, Redan... We didn't kill Godfrey?
[144:33.21]Wait, no.
[144:34.41]We need to kill Godrick.
[144:37.63]No, we did kill Godrick, didn't we?
[144:39.15]Yeah, we did.
[144:39.65]Yeah, we did.
[144:42.84]It's weird because it's all randomized, so we don't even know what progress we're on.
[144:50.64]What's the... Yeah, we need to go to the plateau.
[144:55.79]Also, there's a boss right inside here if you want to do that because we're like... I think it was a dragon.
[144:59.77]Let's do it.
[145:00.47]To your right.
[145:04.38]didn't want to go in here because I thought it was the commander and I hate the fight but like it's not that fight was really annoying is this even him this is the glintstone dragon oh I got comet
[145:33.37]That's actually a huge deal.
[145:35.78]Comet Azure?
[145:37.50]Just Comet.
[145:38.68]Isn't Comet Azure like the crazy one?
[145:50.75]Holy shit.
[145:56.53]I don't know why I thought that was a good idea.
[145:57.99]There's guys behind us, like, throwing shit at us.
[146:01.15]Oh, that's... Oh, there it is.
[146:03.57]They got me.
[146:04.21]They fucking got me.
[146:06.09]There's guys throwing, like, boomerangs over here.
[146:12.65]There's a guy with a ballista, too.
[146:14.05]Do you want me to... Well, I'm dead anyways.
[146:20.07]Never mind.
[146:21.07]Okay.
[146:22.27]I'm not sure that was even the boss because I... I don't know.
[146:25.47]I think it is.
[146:29.74]Jesus.
[146:37.99]Jesus!
[146:38.81]Jesus!
[146:41.49]Shit.
[146:43.89]I'm like trapped.
[146:44.69]Okay, there we go.
[146:51.50]This is weird.
[146:52.14]This doesn't feel right.
[146:59.77]That's better, okay.
[147:04.02]Where are we going?
[147:04.98]We're gonna kill this.
[147:07.10]Did you rest to get rid of your debuff if you had it?
[147:09.48]That's... Thank you.
[147:14.47]Why are you handcuffed to the chair?
[147:17.31]Yeah, I was like, what's happening?
[147:18.89]I can't get out of here!
[147:20.06]Help!
[147:20.38]No, that wasn't the boss.
[147:26.06]It's a Magma Wyrm.
[147:28.93]Commander Magma Wyrm.
[147:31.41]It's a commander this time.
[147:37.37]Well, OK.
[147:39.67]I'm not seeing the names of things when you fight them, which is why I don't know the names of anything.
[147:45.50]You don't see it on the help bar?
[147:47.10]Nope.
[147:49.92]Like when it's a real like boss and it has an actual health bar.
[147:54.11]This one is just like a normal enemy health part of me, really?
[147:58.30]Yeah.
[148:16.06]Let's get off the horse.
[148:17.15]It's like makes it harder.
[148:18.03]I don't know what I mean.
[148:20.49]Scarlet rotted by.
[148:23.52]is it the guy throwing boomerangs I don't know it's still going up like what fire versus fire there's something on the ground like what is happening to me
[148:52.06]Okay, I guess just like the flowers on the ground do that.
[148:54.90]I've never seen that.
[149:05.17]I probably shouldn't be doing that because some of that fire is mine and will not hurt you.
[149:08.75]I'm like putting traps down for you.
[149:13.25]Doing a little bit of deception.
[149:28.02]Did I not hit that at all?
[149:29.74]Yeah, I do.
[149:30.28]I have scarlet rot now too.
[149:32.10]Yeah, standing in the flowers on the edges of this arena are scarlet rot.
[149:37.25]Oh, shit.
[149:43.15]Oh, did you actually get full build up?
[149:45.21]Yeah, I did.
[149:45.83]I wasn't paying attention to it.
[149:50.06]You don't have a cure?
[149:51.10]I do.
[150:07.89]a lot better at that timing he hasn't got me with it oh I thought he was going the other way I thought he was swinging that way
[150:35.48]We're kind of pros at killing magma.
[150:38.96]Like, it's the only boss in the game.
[150:55.77]Oh!
[150:57.49]He killed me.
[150:58.37]Be careful!
[151:00.23]I couldn't see where he was swinging it.
[151:07.95]I thought he killed you for a second.
[151:11.79]OK, we got him.
[151:14.43]Yeah, I just saw I was just looking at his stomach and I was trying to gauge off of when he was going to swing by his like stomach undulations and I got it wrong.
[151:22.72]He's undulating, he's undulating.
[151:28.80]So do I get souls for that weird, right?
[151:33.34]Because technically I'm not sure.
[151:35.32]I thought that I did when you killed the dragon that one time and I was dead during it, but then my souls were on the ground.
[151:39.99]So I think the souls that you were supposed to get, you have to pick up now.
[151:44.97]I actually don't know.
[151:46.07]I think that, yeah, I have zero.
[151:47.49]Oh, alright.
[151:48.73]That makes sense.
[151:50.21]Alright.
[151:50.99]I get it.
[151:59.42]Wait.
[152:01.98]Oh, okay.
[152:02.88]I was looking at chat.
[152:07.00]Oh, we came here to go do Redan.
[152:11.42]You gotta remember, sometimes I'm just kind of like walking forward and looking this way to look at what you guys are talking about.
[152:16.80]I want to be part of the conversation.
[152:17.86]I want to see what you guys are saying.
[152:19.46]What are you guys saying?
[152:33.67]Alright.
[152:35.15]I feel like people are coming into my chat first time chat from user.
[152:40.15]Did he ever mention the blender he uses?
[152:42.81]Like they're just like trying to get me to like, like bait me into talking about some psycho shit you do.
[152:48.68]Is that what they do here?
[152:50.84]Is that what you guys do?
[152:54.26]You guys just be like, oh, hey, dude.
[152:57.91]You ever played Mousetrap, the game?
[153:00.97]Oh, yeah, I played Mousetrap, but let's talk about it.
[153:02.79]Is that what you guys do?
[153:03.57]Like, oh, hey, man, like, I just got back from... I just took, like, a flight to Miami, and I had, like, some of the best, like, pizza I've ever had.
[153:14.54]Do you like pizza?
[153:17.13]Maybe I'm reading too much into it that I feel like you have a blender story.
[153:21.15]No.
[153:21.31]No.
[153:23.18]Okay, then he's legitimately wondering what your blender is because he says he made a smoothie and it was bad.
[153:27.72]I think he needs advice.
[153:30.89]Wait, hold on.
[153:31.69]I read the situation way wrong.
[153:33.93]Hold on a second.
[153:34.51]Somebody came into your chat and asked, hey man, I made a wicked fucked up smoothie.
[153:38.09]It sucked.
[153:38.97]What do I do?
[153:39.81]Like 30 minutes ago, it was like, yeah, I like smoothies too.
[153:46.07]What blender does he use?
[153:48.96]Why?
[153:49.34]What silver tear?
[153:53.65]What is this red name?
[153:54.91]Huh?
[153:57.31]Does somebody just fight?
[153:58.11]There's like a person fighting here.
[154:00.87]I don't know.
[154:01.79]I don't see it.
[154:02.83]Who the fuck is this?
[154:04.58]Oh yeah, I saw this guy earlier.
[154:06.18]I thought it was you.
[154:07.10]There's just a regular guy.
[154:11.50]Why is he naked?
[154:13.26]Who is this?
[154:17.19]Whoa!
[154:25.42]Who is that?
[154:31.62]Anyways.
[154:32.02]Here's the thing about making a smoothie.
[154:35.06]And don't fuck this up.
[154:36.22]It's so easy to... Hold on.
[154:37.46]This is legendary.
[154:38.24]Do not put your hand in the blender.
[154:39.60]No.
[154:39.90]No.
[154:40.02]Listen.
[154:40.62]Yes.
[154:40.94]Don't do that.
[154:41.92]That's... But listen to me.
[154:44.36]People... I do this too all the time.
[154:47.70]And I got another remembrance.
[154:52.22]You're just fighting random guys.
[154:56.52]Okay.
[154:58.76]A lot of times when you have a blender, you'll put way too much shit in it.
[155:03.51]You'll put a... Oh, I guess it's a strawberry banana smoothie.
[155:07.55]May as well put three handfuls of strawberries in here.
[155:11.35]Don't do that.
[155:12.47]You don't actually need to use that much material.
[155:16.61]And easy on the liquid.
[155:18.67]People just dump a shitload of liquid in there and they have like... Oh my god, I didn't die.
[155:26.14]Did the charisma knight kill you?
[155:27.96]No, I was trying to go up this tower.
[155:29.65]This tower.
[155:30.97]I thought it would be easier with random enemies.
[155:33.62]It's not.
[155:34.38]Let me help this person.
[155:36.98]When you are making a smoothie, if you want to thicken up a smoothie a little bit, the easiest way to do that is to just use a little bit of yogurt.
[155:45.36]Just get some plain, or maybe vanilla, just Greek yogurt.
[155:50.65]If it's like, oh, this is a little too thin, I don't know.
[155:52.97]Just like, boom, a little bit of Greek yogurt.
[155:55.97]Bingo.
[155:56.81]Done.
[155:57.81]And then if it's too thick, then you put a little water in.
[155:59.77]No, don't put water.
[156:00.71]Who's putting water?
[156:02.83]Put some more Greek yogurt in.
[156:04.93]Don't use water.
[156:07.92]The base of your smoothie should be only a few things.
[156:10.58]Uh, excuse me.
[156:11.34]The base of the human fucking body is water.
[156:14.74]Why not water?
[156:18.02]Because it's going to mess with the flavor profile and it's going to be too thin.
[156:22.96]Oh, the water is going to have too much flavor.
[156:27.04]It's going to throw everything off.
[156:28.74]Ster, you can keep using water and keep making dog shit ass smoothies.
[156:32.32]That's fine with me.
[156:36.40]This guy doesn't drink water.
[156:39.11]So, I'm going to recommend you oat milk.
[156:43.06]I'm also going to recommend you
[156:47.23]it happened it was in your chat and I'm doing it this is the thing that you told me happens you are the guy teaching me how to punch the thing that story from that no no that's different if you had walked up to that guy and said hey uh I just punched this thing and I don't get it can you you look like a big strong guy can you help me that's not what happened this person asked you this person came up and asked you
[157:10.71]You didn't walk up to that guy at this restaurant.
[157:13.86]You didn't walk up to this guy and say, hey, I need some help.
[157:16.12]Could you explain to me what your strategy is?
[157:19.18]Let's take two steps back.
[157:20.60]He asked, what blender do you use?
[157:24.04]And you're on about fucking what milk?
[157:27.18]You haven't mentioned the blender.
[157:29.50]Because you told me that you said this person messed up their smoothie?
[157:33.62]He just asked what blender you use.
[157:35.88]You added context to it, though.
[157:38.70]You said, oh, he screwed up his smoothie real bad.
[157:41.40]Can we hear what blender you're using?
[157:45.43]I have a Vitamix.
[157:47.89]There you go.
[157:49.67]Oh, that was easy.
[157:52.49]That was really easy.
[157:53.43]I should do that more often.
[157:54.83]Where are you?
[157:55.53]You're like... I went up to the top.
[157:59.00]Oh, I reset the enemies for you.
[158:01.94]There's a chest up here if you want it.
[158:06.54]I've already been up there.
[158:12.64]Vitamix.
[158:13.36]L-U-L.
[158:14.38]What?
[158:18.00]And that's what happens when I read chat.
[158:20.03]I'm fine.
[158:22.47]What's wrong with Vitamix?
[158:26.31]I mean, they're a little pricey.
[158:27.51]They are.
[158:27.83]They are.
[158:28.29]But it's like a... If you... Listen.
[158:31.25]If you are making stuff in a blender all the time, it's... Game crashed.
[158:35.52]Your game crashed?
[158:37.86]My game crashed.
[158:40.42]That's a common Vitamix L. What are you talking about?
[158:43.97]They're like... It's like an industry standard blender.
[158:47.77]Oh, I don't know.
[158:49.08]I use the Ninja.
[158:52.84]Those are fine, too.
[158:53.84]There's nothing wrong with that.
[159:00.64]I have one, it's great.
[159:01.46]Yeah, if you can, if you are big, big into putting stuff in a blender, smoothies, you know, like making like soups and shit, making sauces and pastes and garlic and making all kinds of cool shit, right?
[159:19.84]I don't do any of that.
[159:20.96]I make smoothies only.
[159:27.08]let me tell you ask if you do you you're like you're talking about it like you do it like you have experience I was like man I have been wanting to make like some homemade chili for a while but I also just don't want to do it I have made I did my re-invite to you I I that's kind of not true I do I have made hummus a few times
[159:50.70]Homemade hummus is actually fantastic.
[159:52.57]Although, the last time I did it, I put like way too much garlic and way too much lemon juice in it, and I gave myself wicked bad heartburn for like three days.
[160:02.19]Three?
[160:03.19]Oh, it was bad.
[160:04.32]It was fucking awful.
[160:05.72]That's why you didn't stream those three days, guys.
[160:10.98]You're like, where's Jeremiah?
[160:12.44]That's right.
[160:13.94]Some wicked sick amount of fucking garlic.
[160:18.08]You can do that in a food processor.
[160:19.24]Yeah, but you can also make milkshakes in this thing.
[160:21.12]You can also make smoothies.
[160:23.13]And it pulverizes shit.
[160:26.61]A Vitamix?
[160:28.19]Pul-ver-ize.
[160:29.68]My game crashed.
[160:33.72]Slap chop?
[160:40.49]I got a view of what that looked like.
[160:43.29]I did like a pog face.
[160:46.36]It snapped to like a... What was that?
[160:49.86]Did you guys see that?
[160:53.24]Let's be cheaters.
[160:54.66]What do you mean?
[160:56.65]Can't you just jump off the mountain and end up in Radon's arena?
[161:02.22]Maybe I don't know.
[161:03.58]How?
[161:03.78]Alright.
[161:04.14]I have a question for you.
[161:04.98]This is very serious.
[161:06.30]How do you know all these like wacky speedrun strats, but you didn't see like, why if you know the wacky speedrun strats, then you'd miss a lot of shit.
[161:18.90]True.
[161:20.64]Yeah.
[161:21.19]that's what I mean like I remember Loretta but you would just like walk into the arena and then there was like a setup to like hit her three times with a great sword then she would stagger then you'd kill her and then you just walk out of the arena like she's dead already so when I was like oh there's a fate I had no idea she had a phase two and I've probably actually killed her like four or five times that's insane
[161:50.82]But anyways, this shit gets pulverized.
[161:53.96]It's not just like a little ring, ring, ring.
[161:56.80]I'm telling you right now, I'm serious.
[161:58.76]Sometimes I feel like when I turn the blender on, when I turn on my Vitamix and it's like, this thing's fucking powerful, dude.
[162:05.40]Dude, what you just did is like when you're talking to an NPC in a game and you accidentally selected the dialogue option, you've already heard.
[162:13.83]I was like, oh, tell me about the castle.
[162:15.39]Oh, yeah, Radon and Loretta.
[162:16.97]And then like, okay, tell me about the mix.
[162:18.91]Oh, fuck.
[162:19.35]I did the mixer one again.
[162:20.45]I'm going to finish this last thought, and then we're going to stop.
[162:31.49]I seriously, I feel, sometimes, sometimes.
[162:35.64]You can't skip this cutscene.
[162:37.46]I'm sorry.
[162:38.84]It's grayed out.
[162:39.86]It's like, you're tapping start.
[162:41.58]Uh-uh.
[162:42.24]This is important lore.
[162:43.76]This is a storyline cutscene.
[162:45.63]You can't skip this one.
[162:47.71]When I turn my blender on and I turn it up powerful, sometimes I feel like my lights flicker.
[162:51.11]Because it's so powerful.
[162:55.43]Sometimes it's like, oh my, here we go.
[162:56.91]This thing's got like a million, this thing's going.
[162:59.45]And it's like, wait a minute, what just happened?
[163:04.62]These things are powerful.
[163:08.99]Dude's bragging right now.
[163:12.03]Talking about it like someone would talk about their car.
[163:14.05]What engine it's got.
[163:15.21]Oh, my blender, man.
[163:16.59]My blender fucking blocks the grid down.
[163:21.55]Let's get this thing rocking.
[163:22.95]Who wants a smoothie?
[163:24.44]Oh, you do?
[163:25.20]You do?
[163:25.74]Here we go.
[163:26.92]Alright.
[163:30.22]You fucking just blow out a whole neighborhood.
[163:37.07]Oh, God.
[163:41.31]Jeez.
[163:45.42]You're too wild.
[163:47.26]Not really.
[163:48.04]This is not even a weird conversation.
[163:51.82]We're just talking.
[163:52.50]This is a great script tonight.
[163:56.73]We're just talking.
[163:58.99]Super Saiyan Blender.
[164:01.24]No, I love my Vitamix.
[164:03.38]Don't you dare talk about it like it's bad.
[164:06.20]I don't even know.
[164:08.74]I'm not invested in this.
[164:11.97]I just want you to join my game.
[164:13.31]I'm coming.
[164:25.43]This is nuclear powered blender.
[164:34.55]To be fair, it hasn't done that in a long time.
[164:39.88]But that's still funny.
[164:43.94]Yes, I don't remember when this activates.
[164:46.08]We can't use it.
[164:47.02]I think we have to go across the bridge.
[164:50.19]I remember they like shoot missiles at you.
[164:52.77]Yeah, they shoot a lot.
[164:53.61]I think we have to go sit at a bonfire in the plateau.
[165:00.76]There's also that tower nearby that has like 400 million items all around it.
[165:07.57]Has it done it before?
[165:08.83]It probably hasn't even ever done it.
[165:10.23]I just like feel like it's happening.
[165:14.43]I don't know.
[165:14.83]This thing is powerful.
[165:17.43]Alright.
[165:17.77]Alright.
[165:18.19]You know what?
[165:19.75]He loves it so much it changes his perception of reality.
[165:23.01]Like my lights are flickering.
[165:24.79]I don't know for real if they are, but they could be.
[165:27.76]Because it's that powerful.
[165:29.38]No, this thing.
[165:30.16]I... This thing has like... It's like a 10 speed.
[165:33.78]I don't think I've ever made it go past like 6.
[165:35.65]Because you're scared.
[165:37.87]You have no idea.
[165:38.71]I don't know what will happen if I go to 7.
[165:40.11]No, no, no.
[165:40.77]These things are legit.
[165:41.97]These are legit.
[165:45.57]His vision goes dark.
[165:50.21]They sell it and they say you're only going to need to go to five.
[165:52.81]We've never tested it at six.
[165:55.11]We definitely don't want to go to seven.
[165:57.09]And ten will definitely fuck you up.
[165:59.34]It's like seven, eight.
[166:02.28]The house starts to shake.
[166:03.74]Like a coffee cup is on the counter.
[166:06.92]The coffee's kind of like T-Rex-ing.
[166:10.70]We don't know what could happen.
[166:14.61]Oh, didn't you want to come here?
[166:18.04]no but why not why not get the bonnie I think you can buy different things from here yeah like you can buy stuff from here but it costs the dragon thingies really because I have a few of them I got some decent stuff in here actually now I can drop spells let me ask you if any of these are doing it for you because I could just buy them
[166:49.90]I have Great Heal.
[166:52.21]You have a dragon heart?
[166:53.29]I have three dragon hearts.
[166:54.97]Oh.
[166:55.77]Okay.
[166:58.95]Great Heal.
[166:59.25]Great Heal.
[167:00.91]Lord's Divine.
[167:01.67]Do you need me to read what they do?
[167:04.07]No.
[167:04.92]Lord's Divine Fortification.
[167:08.00]Elden Stars, which is 50 faith.
[167:11.18]It's the Elden Beast Remembrance spell.
[167:14.58]Probably sucks.
[167:17.01]This is all faith.
[167:19.23]Black Flame, Bestial Constitution, or Bestial Vitality.
[167:25.99]I could go for the heal.
[167:27.07]Because if I switch, I would kind of like to be like a heal bot fireman faith caster.
[167:32.64]But I'm not sure I'm going to.
[167:33.82]Great heal?
[167:34.98]Yeah.
[167:36.96]Okay.
[167:37.18]Let me see if I can put it.
[167:38.16]Do you want anything else?
[167:39.74]Am I going to turn into a dragon?
[167:43.86]Maybe.
[167:44.06]Okay.
[167:48.10]I've got the carrion night sword in here, which I kind of want, but I can't.
[167:51.91]I'm drop the dragon heart.
[167:53.87]I cannot drop the drop the hearts.
[167:56.23]I dropped the other spell I have to just in case you use it.
[168:07.53]OK, let's continue.
[168:10.35]On our quest to how do we activate the Don man?
[168:14.65]I can't believe you got one guide in somebody else's chat.
[168:21.03]It was an important topic.
[168:22.53]He can talk to you.
[168:23.71]He can take command of a conversation if it's something that he has great expertise in.
[168:29.13]And that just happened to be one of the things.
[168:32.20]I'm not even an expert.
[168:34.00]I told you, I don't even like... I use it to make a few very important things.
[168:39.50]Dragon!
[168:39.92]Dragon!
[168:58.06]oh my god that's a lot of damage that's a big spread I kind of don't even want to fight him I'm bored of him I don't want to play with this anymore do you want to leave yeah okay we're all we're just fighting dragons and salamanders back to back to back
[169:22.36]So, if it randomizes every enemy, and it randomizes everything, right?
[169:27.28]Does that mean that... Have we seen... Can a duplicate happen?
[169:32.76]Have we seen a duplicate worm?
[169:34.26]Or are there four worms?
[169:34.82]Duplicates don't happen, but there's a lot of worms and there's a lot of dragons.
[169:38.26]Yeah, that's true.
[169:41.18]So, I don't think we'll see another worm then.
[169:42.94]I think there's only four worms in the game?
[169:44.78]I think we got them all.
[169:47.20]How have we not seen an ulcerated spirit?
[169:49.17]There's like ten of those.
[169:58.24]We did.
[170:00.04]Didn't we?
[170:00.40]I think we only saw one.
[170:04.86]Oh, we've only seen one of the jump trees as well.
[170:06.98]Do you want the... Wait, is this a... Is this a talisman?
[170:15.28]You should probably take this if it is.
[170:20.08]Is it... Yeah, it sucks.
[170:24.38]Do you want this charm that raises focus?
[170:28.32]No.
[170:29.02]No.
[170:35.60]Why did I just buy this?
[170:36.62]It was 100% more expensive.
[170:38.28]I just got lazy because I didn't feel like... Okay.
[170:52.61]Why are you killing this merchant?
[170:55.37]Sell something I can use.
[170:58.53]You're no merchant.
[171:06.49]Let's go.
[171:06.87]Hey, that's fine.
[171:08.53]Let's go.
[171:09.51]Cops coming.
[171:11.38]You can do the dishonorable kills and de-rank.
[171:13.50]I don't care.
[171:18.34]I remember being in WoW groups, like, oh, we're gonna, let's go to the crossroads!
[171:23.08]And it's like, once somebody started killing, like, the civilians, it's just like, people just start spamming dropping group.
[171:28.82]It was like the biggest troll was somebody, because if you were part of a group, and you, people started killing civilians.
[171:37.38]you would lose honor.
[171:39.84]So people would just be in groups, be like, oh yeah, we're gonna go to the crossroads, it's gonna be so much fun.
[171:44.48]Oh, don't do any dishonorable kills though.
[171:46.94]And then all of a sudden you'd see, dishonorable kills, dishonorable kills, and somebody was just killing them.
[171:50.90]And it was just like, what the fuck, dude?
[171:52.26]Like, you just ruined everything.
[171:53.74]You just ruined like a week's worth of work for me.
[171:58.54]How does that ruin work for you?
[172:00.26]Because it would de-rank you.
[172:01.89]Because you had honorable kills, honor, and dishonor.
[172:06.48]rain of stars founding rain of stars there are items on the top of the skull that's right there are let's uh we're gonna go through the town and fight the uh the boss in here which is gonna be two bosses and it's gonna be fun yeah didn't know you were into wow pvp I mean it wasn't really but I mean it existed
[172:35.50]Oh, we got to do the thing to open the door.
[172:40.74]No magical crab.
[172:44.78]Ghost crab, ghost crab, magical puker, whatever their names are.
[172:51.70]The puke punk.
[173:18.10]What?
[173:18.68]That was very weird.
[173:19.80]Okay.
[173:31.31]That piece of shit.
[173:32.79]You're in so much... Oh, I... I was... I had a great view of that.
[173:37.67]If you had gotten hit by that on the ladder and fell down... Oh, my God.
[173:40.23]You know how many laugh out louds there would have been.
[173:42.17]There's an anti-air cannon down there.
[173:43.49]Watch out.
[173:47.19]I fell I pressed oh I did press jump yeah are you just watching me do that there's like three towers to do and you're just watching me do one you'll be alright yeah I'll be alright
[174:16.53]My second jump isn't working sometimes though.
[174:18.39]It really isn't.
[174:19.49]I think we're lagging a little.
[174:21.19]And the inputs aren't being there.
[174:23.05]Probably.
[174:26.86]No, I want to do it.
[174:29.96]You had plenty of time.
[174:30.98]That was it.
[174:37.00]I think I did the other one.
[174:38.82]Like yesterday.
[174:40.14]Really?
[174:40.52]Here, I'm going to comet that guy.
[174:43.18]This guy?
[174:43.56]If I can lock onto it.
[174:48.48]I can't get on my horse and I can't lock onto it.
[175:10.03]Cool.
[175:11.29]Nice.
[175:11.69]Nice shot.
[175:13.94]Alright, so from here we gotta this chest down the street.
[175:17.28]Make sure you get the chest.
[175:23.33]OK.
[175:24.43]Crows Academy scroll.
[175:31.85]He's almost 40 dot dot dot.
[175:36.08]Yeah, I know.
[175:36.68]I know.
[175:40.12]I know.
[175:43.08]It's unfortunate how when you turn 40, they put you in a box and just push you out in the sea.
[175:50.05]Just floating out there.
[175:50.89]You just see like millions of other boxes just floating around individual boxes.
[175:55.71]I thought this was a bonfire.
[175:58.29]I guess we go downstairs.
[176:02.03]Why is this not open?
[176:05.52]That one doesn't open yet.
[176:07.94]You got to go down here.
[176:08.92]And I just thought that was a bonfire for some reason.
[176:19.68]Okay.
[176:20.46]Elden Beast with his buddy, another dragon.
[176:25.84]If it's a Magma Wyrm, I don't want to say anything.
[176:29.95]Okay.
[176:30.89]Oh, it's just one.
[176:34.13]This is bad, but this is going to be awful.
[176:37.87]Look at how small this is.
[176:39.13]Well, he can't run away.
[176:40.09]Yeah, but he's going to do the bubble burst explosive bursting move and it's going to hit us.
[176:46.17]I don't.
[176:46.65]I've never heard of that.
[176:48.64]Well, he's doing it right now.
[176:50.42]Yeah, this isn't real.
[177:03.93]I'm going to hit him soon.
[177:13.89]Jesus I don't know if that's helping or his body is in such weird positions on the walls it's so hard to find like a foot on the ground yeah
[177:45.90]there it is I'm gonna do it in three two um yeah he moved that was he moved around weirdly and like went up the wall god damn it
[178:14.90]oh god this is it he's doing this the thing I was talking about I can't believe he didn't hit us let's just hope he doesn't do it again I didn't even see anything oh come on man okay I thought you jump over it I guess not
[178:46.60]Are you serious?
[178:49.18]He's going to kill me.
[178:50.80]What killed you?
[178:51.98]How did you die?
[178:52.76]How did you die?
[178:55.46]I also got grabbed by one.
[178:59.67]There were two.
[179:00.79]What?
[179:05.19]Okay, let me focus here.
[179:06.49]Never mind.
[179:11.31]What was that?
[179:13.53]What happened?
[179:13.93]He grabbed both of us with the same... I don't know what happened.
[179:21.47]The other Astel from Snowfield?
[179:27.17]It was the ground.
[179:28.75]The ground was shaken.
[179:29.95]Maybe it was a desync.
[179:31.33]Maybe you did get desynced or something.
[179:33.93]No, they said the other Astel duplicates itself or something.
[179:43.36]Oh, and they're just so close to each other, maybe?
[179:44.80]Yeah, no, because he, like, changed colors and, like, clones of him both went for me and you.
[179:54.45]Okay.
[179:54.55]Okay, well, I didn't even have full flasks and, um... Do you know?
[179:59.07]Yeah.
[180:01.56]I'm just saying that that, like, wasn't fair.
[180:03.58]I'm out the door.
[180:05.68]Proof that it wasn't an instant kill move.
[180:09.92]Yeah, but, I mean...
[180:13.38]It is.
[180:15.88]Your health is your health is just really low, but it is though.
[180:18.72]How is that not a leg?
[180:38.91]Oh, it is.
[180:39.31]It was weird.
[180:48.26]He's got to be close to stun.
[180:49.44]I think he is.
[180:55.48]Especially in the head.
[181:01.53]Really?
[181:01.79]I thought that was going to do it.
[181:02.77]Okay, that was weird.
[181:21.46]As janky as this is, I'm liking this a lot more than the real Astel fight.
[181:26.10]Yeah, the fight sucks.
[181:30.49]The real Astel fight and the Elden Beast fight are the same annoyance for me.
[181:33.89]It's like, oh, it's a gigantic huge area and I'm just going to literally disappear and be across the whole game.
[181:42.43]Want to run at me again?
[181:47.69]I still can't believe that that Elden Beast fight is not a horse fight.
[181:50.47]I feel like it was supposed to be.
[182:10.32]What the fuck?
[182:14.41]I can't believe he's not staggered.
[182:15.63]This is crazy.
[182:17.01]I haven't hit him in a while, but... Okay, so that time two went for me, it felt like.
[182:30.13]That was weird.
[182:32.27]Oh, he caught you?
[182:32.94]What?
[182:33.18]There was like 15 hands.
[182:39.58]Like 10 hands came up to grab me.
[182:45.40]You got this.
[182:45.86]I drank one too many.
[183:00.99]You got it.
[183:01.33]I think he's fucking... Doing Astel shit.
[183:16.22]Okay, no more healing.
[183:40.43]That was, that was wacky.
[183:41.93]That was goofy.
[183:42.77]So was that.
[183:45.81]I hope he doesn't do another AOE attack.
[183:57.01]Seriously, like somebody's just going to get grabbed.
[184:00.15]That move is, when there's two of them doing it, this is no way.
[184:03.45]There's no way.
[184:05.02]I dodged something, it felt like.
[184:07.10]It felt like I avoided something.
[184:09.20]It feels like they both do it, but one of them is staggered a little bit, so it's like grab, grab, and there's just hands everywhere.
[184:15.76]I rolled into the second one, it felt like.
[184:20.40]It's like six to eight of them.
[184:23.04]Oh, shit.
[184:26.20]Can you block that with a shield?
[184:27.68]If you just hold the shield up, can you just like, ooh, or will he just grab you?
[184:32.05]There's no way.
[184:38.31]Oh.
[184:48.54]Where did this Yeti come from?
[184:49.82]I don't know.
[185:06.79]OK.
[185:28.46]how do you how do you get away from you can jump those can you I thought I tried it last time I think so but you just have to like not get hit you know true
[185:52.77]God.
[185:57.81]Where the hell am I?
[185:58.63]What am I?
[185:58.99]Where am I?
[185:59.33]What's going on with me?
[186:00.43]Where is he?
[186:01.05]Yeah, that was weird.
[186:02.80]What the fuck?
[186:03.64]He looks like he's picked you up.
[186:06.62]No, he's sliding into the corner.
[186:09.96]This is not good.
[186:15.79]We should probably just get out and let him teleport.
[186:17.25]Yeah, I'm walking away.
[186:20.81]This is the asshole fight where you want to zone him.
[186:38.36]I thought something just broke through the ceiling.
[186:39.84]It was his fucking leg.
[186:41.72]What the hell?
[186:42.20]It's stinger.
[186:50.15]It really was a good second there I was like, when did he get like magma attacks?
[187:08.96]That meteor shit
[187:10.52]It shoots in front of them.
[187:11.50]That's why we're not going to hit because it's like all target in front of them.
[187:13.76]And we're like so like locked into these corners behind him.
[187:17.22]You cannot jump that.
[187:18.86]I think you just have to dodge through it.
[187:20.46]I wonder.
[187:21.46]There's a trick to it.
[187:22.30]You just have to run away from it.
[187:30.54]You can't dodge it at all.
[187:31.70]Okay.
[187:34.60]You definitely dodge it, but like it has to be one of the last ones.
[187:42.11]He's going to turn into like seven guys in a second.
[187:45.16]He's going to do some five guy shit.
[187:48.96]Stop doing this move.
[187:50.20]Why does he keep... Make sure you're at full health.
[188:03.49]Oh my God.
[188:05.27]There's a hundred of them.
[188:06.55]We thought there were two.
[188:08.03]It's like 30.
[188:08.39]It's like 10.
[188:12.67]We didn't get him on the first sweep, boys.
[188:18.92]What moves are happening?
[188:25.06]Oh, my God.
[188:36.26]Die!
[188:37.26]Okay.
[188:37.94]He's dead?
[188:39.80]Nice.
[188:40.24]Yeah.
[188:41.42]Oh my goodness.
[188:45.23]That was like seven people, eight people.
[188:48.37]No wonder.
[188:49.99]No wonder we were getting grabbed every time.
[188:54.78]Got some scribbled eggs.
[188:55.52]There are five worms.
[188:55.98]That's so bad.
[189:18.82]Oh, I need a lot more souls.
[189:19.88]I thought I did.
[189:21.68]Here we go.
[189:23.12]30 HP.
[189:23.68]30 vigor.
[189:25.46]Now stop leveling that.
[189:30.41]Cool.
[189:31.19]I got a pot.
[189:35.41]Dragons love me.
[189:38.97]You know the other dragon altar?
[189:40.71]Like way in the beginning.
[189:43.48]I feel like we should go there because they seem to have really good items in it.
[189:48.63]We can do that.
[189:50.83]I thought this opened after you killed them.
[189:52.44]Or is there something else?
[189:55.20]I thought there was a seal.
[189:56.56]Maybe not.
[190:00.82]Maybe I missed.
[190:04.49]I don't know.
[190:07.59]Is it a seal?
[190:09.31]There is a seal, right?
[190:10.25]There's one more tower.
[190:11.85]Which one?
[190:12.27]This one over here?
[190:38.44]Yeah, I'm trying the same thing over on the other side.
[190:41.51]I just do.
[190:41.99]I don't want to do it the right way.
[190:43.19]I want to do it like the dumb cheesy way.
[190:45.67]I forget where the right way is.
[190:53.12]Oh, oh, I got it.
[190:54.44]Alright, which one do we need?
[191:03.75]Up here.
[191:16.60]Where's the ladder?
[191:26.60]I believe in you.
[191:27.34]I'm just riding around.
[191:28.23]Yeah, there is this one here.
[191:29.43]I thought I did all of them.
[191:40.53]They can get, I mean, it's pretty same.
[191:43.77]It's pretty like samey out here.
[191:45.73]So I mean, like I was saying, I did some of them yesterday.
[191:49.01]I like randomly was in the swamp and you weren't here.
[191:53.03]So I don't know, maybe it didn't save one of them, but I was pretty sure I did one and we just did two and I think you only need three.
[191:58.97]I think it's three.
[192:04.75]OK, let's continue.
[192:15.37]I'm going to rest for a second.
[192:25.37]Thought that was you.
[192:34.93]Ball!
[192:36.97]That ball was very aggressive and very angry.
[192:46.49]Give him the ball call.
[192:54.58]That's blood.
[192:55.70]I'm just going up to the church.
[193:07.14]Mm hmm.

[193:44.38]I thought we were going to accidentally just kill her.
[193:48.31]I know there's the cave straight up here.
[193:49.73]The hidden illusory wall.
[193:52.91]Annoying one.
[193:54.35]Yeah.
[193:56.25]This one sucks.
[194:03.15]Unendurable frenzy.
[194:04.52]I have a frenzy move.
[194:05.48]What the fuck is that?
[194:07.46]Regal Omen Baron?
[194:08.76]What?
[194:10.00]What the hell is that?
[194:14.98]I want to do a frenzy build.
[194:17.66]You want to do that?
[194:20.89]Uh... What?
[194:23.73]A frenzy build?
[194:25.13]What about it?
[194:26.29]Yeah, I tried it once with the bike spike.
[194:29.55]And all like the crazy like... With the eyes.
[194:33.08]The spells.
[194:38.90]Is he pretending to know what I'm talking about?
[194:40.60]I know what you're talking about.
[194:43.02]shabiri's woe and shabiri yes yeah you know oh I I know it I don't um okay so let me take a look at the map I'll be really honest with you you completely missed I'm gonna be really honest with you mm-hmm
[195:08.66]we've done a lot I'm surprised we've actually done this much on randomizer yeah I mean once you get the gear and you just go to the places and kill the guys yeah it's pretty cool uh oh black whoa alright my game does not want me to look over to the left for some reason
[195:36.81]Yeah, my game is freaking out.
[195:39.80]Where's my health go?
[195:41.52]You only had half health when we came up here.
[195:43.24]I did?
[195:43.86]I think from the wolf.
[195:46.36]You never like healed after that.
[195:49.11]Oh, yeah.
[195:49.85]I'm lagging so bad.
[195:51.65]Yeah, do not look that way.
[195:54.17]There's something that spawned in over there that's just not... The game does not like it.
[196:00.64]Yeah, so look at this.
[196:03.34]Look at this.
[196:03.80]I wonder what it is.
[196:05.90]What did the game spawn in there that's making it so horrible?
[196:09.28]I don't know.
[196:11.12]I'm going in the cave.
[196:13.34]I'm kind of saving up.
[196:15.24]I'm kind of curious, but whatever.
[196:18.18]I don't want to hunt down the thing that's going to make us crash.
[196:21.30]It's true.
[196:28.71]Even in the cave, when I look in that direction,
[196:32.05]Oh shit, yeah.
[196:35.80]Should we go kill whatever it is?
[196:37.02]Is it going to cause a problem?
[196:40.32]I think that reset whatever it was.
[196:42.24]No, no.
[196:44.00]There is just that this is the this is this is our life.
[196:48.04]Maybe it's down here.
[196:52.16]Maybe oh.
[196:55.60]Yeah, maybe like in the boss room there's like some giant thing that doesn't fit in it.
[196:59.68]It's like constantly trying to reset.
[197:03.74]Oh my goodness.
[197:06.58]Yeah, I don't know.
[197:07.04]I find that the 30 FPS is a little bit more cinematic and you can't really see much better than that anyway.
[197:17.02]You remember when that was actually a debate?
[197:19.30]I do.
[197:20.72]Well, here it is, I think.
[197:22.88]Is this it?
[197:30.35]Just take you through this fucking ceiling.
[197:32.23]I went through the ceiling.
[197:37.54]I think it is this thing.
[197:39.42]This thing is not supposed to be down here.
[197:41.44]Oh god.
[197:44.80]Okay.
[197:47.50]When it despawns.
[197:49.92]That.
[197:50.32]That was it.
[197:50.76]That was it.
[197:51.32]Yeah, that was it.
[197:52.32]The fucking turkey down here was causing a huge problem.
[197:54.44]Okay.
[197:59.89]Well, we cleared it.
[198:02.37]We cleared the FPS boss.
[198:21.42]Such crap.
[198:23.62]Look at this fucking garbage.
[198:26.66]Junk.
[198:28.20]Another remembrance?
[198:30.98]No, just like all these crystals.
[198:32.66]Crap.
[198:35.10]like this isn't real like this is a movie set is that what I don't I don't know you don't like crystals I'm making a stupid reference to back when I told you that the crystal spells were all terrible oh did you have a jo crystal dude you have a you have a turmeric bracelet no I don't
[199:03.50]You mean, oh, you mean black tourmaline.
[199:06.58]It's not a turmeric.
[199:07.78]It's not a turmeric bracelet.
[199:10.14]And by the way, I don't have it on anymore.
[199:12.56]I, it's not, I... Whatever.
[199:22.13]Oops.
[199:37.85]you need it for luck wait turmeric wait turmeric actually is very good for you okay but like in a bracelet no is it they're being goofy over here okay it's them star light star bright shine the way through the dungeon tonight you stopped wearing it because you got bullied
[200:11.53]Uh-oh.
[200:12.09]Is that a Mohg-like?
[200:16.47]No.
[200:16.73]That is not a Mohg-like.
[200:19.36]I saw the cape and I couldn't really see what it was.
[200:24.50]Come on.
[200:24.76]You don't even know what a Mohg-like is?
[200:38.30]Oh, this thing has the weird timings.
[200:42.32]They just do this over and over again.
[200:48.34]I'm pretty low on flasks already, so I'm hoping that this boss is not like a bird with its head stuck in the ceiling.
[200:58.64]I think we've gotten pretty decent rolls on these.
[201:02.70]It's not like Placidix, whatever is in here.
[201:16.48]He's blowing the horn.
[201:18.40]Oh my goodness.
[201:19.84]This guy just fucking killed me.
[201:22.98]No, he didn't.
[201:23.48]I thought he did.
[201:27.37]Help!
[201:27.89]Help!
[201:28.13]They're down here!
[201:28.87]Help!
[201:29.17]Someone!
[201:30.03]You're like a thousand feet below the Earth, man.
[201:34.51]Alright.
[201:35.97]You ready?
[201:36.55]What do we got?
[201:36.93]Okay.
[201:44.23]Not that bad.
[201:50.50]Oh, he's a new player.
[201:51.76]This is a new player.
[201:56.93]No!
[202:00.97]Oh, and there's no fire on that one.
[202:18.58]Not that bad.
[202:22.34]We've been getting pretty good rolls in these.
[202:24.52]Those are a lot of souls.
[202:30.48]I like souls.
[202:32.12]That was worth a lot of blood echoes.
[202:37.20]Runes.
[202:38.50]Yeah, let's go farm blood vials.
[202:42.91]It's back.
[202:43.43]Yeah, it is.
[202:44.03]It's because that bird is back.
[202:46.67]We gotta go kill that fucking bird and then come back.
[202:49.24]Let's teleport out of here.
[202:50.47]Honestly.
[202:51.07]Let's go somewhere else.
[202:52.95]I want to fight Verdun, dude.
[202:54.65]What do we have to do to fight Verdun?
[202:55.81]We have to go sit at a bonfire in the plateau.
[202:59.87]I'm teleporting to the church down the hill.
[203:02.45]Because walking would be really hard.
[203:05.79]How do I say yes?
[203:06.59]There we go.
[203:12.24]What's the best essential oil to cure bronchitis?
[203:16.56]I don't.
[203:18.90]I don't think I take whale oil for anything he's talking about whale is a great creature that's one of the biggest creatures yeah antibiotics yeah am I right
[203:49.43]Think about it if you want to get big.
[203:53.62]Think about it.
[203:56.44]I'm a barf drinker did this just trying to channel his energy right now.
[204:14.81]I'm exiting the area where what do you want to go from here?
[204:20.42]I forgot what's on the top of this hill.
[204:26.08]Need an inhaler.
[204:26.84]If I get bronchitis is... I don't know.
[204:30.38]I'm not a fucking doctor.
[204:32.01]I don't know.
[204:43.31]Is there anything at all up here?
[204:48.07]It was just a question.
[204:54.69]Let me tell you something about blenders, first of all.
[204:58.07]Oh, shit.
[204:58.41]We got a Mogu-like.
[205:00.73]Yeah, I think you actually might be accurate.
[205:02.15]That's a Mogu-like enemy, isn't it?
[205:03.85]Nope.
[205:09.62]It's a cool weapon, though.
[205:15.08]Oh, this is actually going to be hard.
[205:19.87]I don't think they can come out.
[205:23.66]Ooh, that's good.
[205:24.60]Whatever that is.
[205:26.74]I don't think I've ever seen this enemy.
[205:29.97]Yeah, you have.
[205:31.21]Down in the giant area when you go across the big chain.
[205:35.29]You mean where you just ignore that whole area and run with your horse and just go up to the giant?
[205:41.92]Did you stream a lot of your Elden Ring?
[205:44.72]Yeah.
[205:45.74]What level were you when you got to the giant area?
[205:50.04]I wonder what level you were.
[206:11.72]You mean the place where you just get on your horse and just ride by everything?
[206:15.28]Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
[206:17.58]Item, item, item alert, item alert, item alert, item alert, item alert, item alert.
[206:22.49]Somber five.
[206:23.89]Are you ready to go beyond?
[206:25.29]Or do you not need that anymore?
[206:29.44]Give it to me.
[206:36.12]Do you have a six?
[206:39.69]I have a seven and an ancient.
[206:42.29]I have a four, a seven, and a nine.
[206:45.85]So that will help.
[206:46.53]I appreciate it.
[206:47.13]Thank you.
[206:58.28]Number go big, big.
[206:59.62]Plus one level.
[207:01.80]With Sombra, that's a big deal.
[207:03.02]That's 10%.
[207:03.28]There's only 10 levels.
[207:06.94]That is a full one out of 10, which is 10%.
[207:10.32]Come on.
[207:14.79]It's going to be more than 10%.
[207:16.09]I have never been over here.
[207:19.45]I've never gone through there.
[207:21.32]I've never been up here.
[207:22.72]I've never been to this tower.
[207:24.50]Have I even played this game?
[207:26.34]I'm starting to wonder maybe I didn't play this game.
[207:29.50]So when you did you play anything off stream to just kind of like in your own free time?
[207:35.88]I think so.
[207:36.58]Yeah.
[207:37.41]You didn't do the thing where it's like, oh, I want to see what this is and just go over there in every single zone.
[207:42.25]Just kind of, what's this?
[207:43.19]I looked a lot of places.
[207:44.59]It's a big game.
[207:46.15]Yeah, but I feel like you missed it.
[207:49.07]You could just probably play this again and just see it.
[207:51.59]I'm sorry that you're mad.
[207:53.75]Yeah, we're very upset with you for not knowing where everything is.
[207:58.05]We're very upset.
[207:59.14]Okay, well, what is usually here?
[208:00.68]Because we came all the way up here and there's like nothing here.
[208:04.63]Very upset with you that you didn't 100% and get every achievement.
[208:07.51]It's just it's like unfortunate that I even know you.
[208:12.39]How many hours do you have in Elden Ring?
[208:15.95]On Steam.
[208:16.91]Actually, I don't know.
[208:17.75]That's a good question.
[208:20.87]Probably not that much considering I did.
[208:24.03]I wanted to play it on my couch.
[208:28.81]So.
[208:30.21]I got it on Xbox.
[208:33.45]So you own like seven copies of the game.
[208:35.23]Get out of the way.
[208:38.03]There's an item on the ground.
[208:42.23]Can I pick it up?
[208:45.40]Thanks.
[208:47.78]I have a series S. Series S is... I love that little thing.
[208:58.18]Well, I think usually you got to come up here because you got to kill the guy who throws the pots down on the road.
[209:03.40]That's about it.
[209:03.94]I mean, you don't even gotta.
[209:07.52]I want to fight for Dawn.
[209:12.76]Jerma, take the wheel.
[209:14.58]Make it happen.
[209:15.54]Okay.
[209:16.32]We need to go to the plateau.
[209:20.70]So we're jumping off.
[209:21.90]But we got a Series X. I didn't really have a need for it.
[209:27.78]Series X...
[209:31.64]I mean, I have a PC.
[209:35.26]Anything that comes out in the Series X, I would just get it here.
[209:37.78]I don't have a PS5.
[209:41.15]Do you have a PS5?
[209:45.85]Nope.
[209:47.09]Do you have any of the current-gen consoles or no?
[209:50.43]You have a Switch, don't you?
[209:51.69]I have a PS4, and they still release every fighting game on that thing.
[209:57.71]You had a Switch, though, didn't you?
[209:58.86]No?
[209:59.28]I have a Switch, yeah.
[210:00.62]I've never used it.
[210:03.26]Is this sealed in the box?
[210:05.01]No, it's a wife device.
[210:07.71]Dude, if it was sealed in the box, I would say keep it in the box and seal it because then, you know, you got it like an heirloom.
[210:12.07]It actually plays like Fire Emblem and Zelda and all that.
[210:17.24]Breath of the Wild's pretty fun.
[210:19.20]You never played it?
[210:20.16]I tried it on like a flight.
[210:21.54]I was like, I'll take the Switch, like play it on the plane.
[210:23.84]Wait, wait, wait.
[210:25.32]Star, star.
[210:26.96]Hold on.
[210:27.81]Be careful.
[210:29.90]I'm going to stop you because you're about to have a lot of people very... You're going to get a Ster L here.
[210:35.68]As I was saying earlier, me and you disagree on everything.
[210:39.46]You liked Breath of the Wild a lot.
[210:43.48]Okay.
[210:43.86]I'm just telling you.
[210:44.80]Just be careful with this next statement.
[210:47.14]It's going to be a doozy, guys.
[210:49.80]Be ready.
[210:52.00]My opinion is that...
[210:55.61]Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild was ign's number one greatest game of all time is number one on their list that's my opinion you take all of the video games ever made and the best game of all time is on the switch and it's Breath of the Wild yeah I disagree with that I disagree with that
[211:20.37]Good, because that list was fucking ridiculous.
[211:22.43]Every Blizzard game was all in, like, the same, like, it was like Starcraft, Warcraft, like, they just, like, I don't know, put all the Blizzard games here.
[211:32.83]I mean, I don't think that Breath of the Wild is the best video game ever made.
[211:37.81]I think it's... Game Crash.
[211:40.17]Aww.
[211:41.47]I want to fight Redon.
[211:42.57]Yes.
[211:43.29]Let's go up to the plateau.
[211:45.81]I think it's really good.
[211:47.33]I think it's really fun.
[211:50.01]If you like Elden Ring, it's just kind of Elden Ring with cartoon graphics.
[211:56.68]I didn't give it enough time.
[211:58.54]And the breaking items and stuff.
[212:01.96]I don't know.
[212:03.08]That rubs me the wrong way, but I definitely haven't given it enough time to even have any opinion.
[212:07.72]I legitimately got to the first dungeon and then just didn't feel like playing the game.
[212:15.86]I didn't like not like it.
[212:17.98]I think it's fun.
[212:18.52]I mean, I've been streaming it, not lately, but I think it's a good game.
[212:25.85]I have one major complaint about Elden Ring, and it's kind of unfair because Bloodborne's like my number one, probably number two, whatever favorite game ever made.
[212:34.99]But Breath of the Wild, even on the Switch, sometimes runs at like 18 frames a second.
[212:41.86]I open the world to you.
[212:44.90]That's the only complaint I really have about it.
[212:57.00]you didn't your first time playing it was on stream right yeah I almost feel like I would I would need to be streaming it to play it
[213:07.50]It's just sitting around to play Breath of the Wild is like, I don't know.
[213:10.80]I feel like it's so big.
[213:12.64]There's so much shit going on and I got to collect all these these peaches.
[213:16.62]I was like, I don't know, but it's a pretty good stream because then I have to set up like a whole like Twitch in my the switch in my room and get like all the cables.
[213:26.32]And that's just who's got time for that.
[213:29.09]Yeah.
[213:30.47]It is a pretty good stream game, though.
[213:31.55]It's a chill game just to kind of.
[213:35.33]Just turn it on and play for a little while.
[213:38.79]Yeah, but I would have to plug in like two cables.
[213:41.33]Alright, so we are... We should not be here.
[213:45.56]We need to go up to... We need to go to the... We need to go to the plateau.
[213:49.98]I think once we get to the plateau, I think we have a cutscene.
[213:55.49]I'm following you 100%.
[213:56.55]Okay.
[213:59.10]Let me make sure I have this right.
[214:02.02]We have to get to the plateau.
[214:03.52]We get a cutscene when we go to the plateau.
[214:05.84]And then it's like, okay, here we go.
[214:07.14]Rodan's available, right?
[214:08.56]That's correct.
[214:14.03]My chat says, please just walk over the bridge.
[214:18.01]Those ballistas might not be manned because of the randomizer.
[214:21.13]That's also very true.
[214:23.21]Let's just walk over the fucking bridge.
[214:26.05]Let's just go.
[214:27.39]Let's just go.
[214:29.22]No, that's part of Ronnie's quest.
[214:32.82]Oh.
[214:33.18]Let's go to the bridge and just fucking walk.
[214:34.66]We have to talk to Ronnie.
[214:41.91]We need a medallion for the bridge.
[214:44.31]Oh, that's right.
[214:47.22]oh yeah and you like like normally I think the medallions in a spot where you just kind of like always get it so I didn't really think about it much but now we don't you get the two halves at the forts uh let me level up first because I don't know if we just get bombarded with missiles I don't want to get behind me soldier shit we need to kill like one thing hold on let me kill like a random thing over here
[215:15.00]I can give you a rune yeah faster I don't is that gonna do it is that enough I don't think that's enough I can like give you another rune you just keep farming me for runes I need like another just give me I need like 800
[215:44.41]I don't know how many that is.
[215:47.97]You activate the festival either by doing Ronnie's quest line or activating any bonfire at Altus Plateau.
[215:54.81]I think the festival is active.
[215:56.93]It was just that we didn't have the medallion to teleport.
[216:05.97]Let's try to do it this way.
[216:07.49]And if we need Ronnie's quest line, I have two of the items for it, I think.
[216:12.89]Let's go over the bridge.
[216:14.21]Yeah, that's probably good.
[216:16.01]I'm going to blast.
[216:16.89]Okay.
[216:30.62]Yeah, there's just like a pimple where the ballista would be.
[216:36.01]I don't know why I didn't just try it.
[216:38.23]Yeah, we kind of didn't trust this somehow.
[216:42.03]I don't know why we didn't trust that this was going to be easy.
[216:46.57]That was rough.
[216:50.24]Oh, look, a dragon.
[216:51.14]What the fuck?
[216:55.74]That was planned.
[216:57.42]They planned that.
[216:58.56]Oh, my God.
[216:59.10]The ambush.
[217:00.10]Alright.
[217:00.60]Just go.
[217:01.12]Don't even fight this.
[217:05.38]I'm glad you got a 3D movie, too.
[217:08.72]That had to have been right in your face, right?
[217:10.68]Yeah, that was...
[217:14.11]I had the 3D glasses on and everything.
[217:26.47]You know what's crazy?
[217:29.63]3D, like 3D glasses, 3D movie, 3D video game stuff really just fucking disintegrated, didn't it?
[217:36.26]dude I was at uh I was at the arcade the other day I was telling you and they have a whole bunch of like vr stuff like oh you can go in like the vr experience the omni room and I was looking at it through the lens of like this is this already feels outdated this just feels like a weird gimmick like I know in like 10 or 20 years that's gonna be like the same thing as the pac-man machine in the corner but like even just seeing it like all brand new vr like like we have a vive headset yeah
[218:07.96]I think... When was the last... You went to an arcade recently when you did that thing, right?
[218:14.54]Yeah, like two days ago.
[218:15.66]Like on the weekend.
[218:17.01]I gotta get your take on this.
[218:18.37]Did you need a Smithing Stone 4?
[218:20.47]What?
[218:20.91]A Smithing Stone 4.
[218:21.75]I just got one.
[218:22.13]Did you need that?
[218:24.05]No, I need like an 8 or something.
[218:26.84]Have you noticed that all the light gun games at the arcades have stayed in like 2003?
[218:34.87]Like their graphics are terrible.
[218:37.11]Yes.
[218:37.39]Frame rates are always dog shit.
[218:38.99]The mechanic.
[218:40.45]Also, this is let me add.
[218:42.39]They have they had like a whole booth where like eight people could go in and play VR and they've got like slippery feet floors.
[218:48.10]So you actually like run in the games and it's got like foot trackers.
[218:51.22]Oh, that's also.
[218:52.02]There's a little miserable.
[218:55.21]that wasn't good also you're just wearing vive headsets but they can't license out vive games that I guess they thought it would be cheaper to make their own games so it's like that you could play Beat Saber but it was like song master and it was they're all just like super shitty copies of all the games you would want to play huh song master
[219:23.80]That's like a great online handle game.
[219:26.45]Like the Song Master.
[219:30.17]What is controlling this globe?
[219:32.93]That's an enemy.
[219:33.69]They're in the Mystic River or whatever.
[219:37.27]Oh, they are.
[219:37.77]The Song Master.
[219:45.94]Yeah, we played Elite Force, which was the generic military death match.
[219:51.76]It took longer to like get us all strapped in than it did to play.
[220:06.08]Yeah, I'm trying to think of what was it when VR came out is when 3D glasses weren't cool anymore, right?
[220:12.91]I think they weren't cool for a while anymore.
[220:16.01]And also they call them 4D glasses now.
[220:20.09]I remember going to see, I believe it was, I think it was Avatar in theaters.
[220:28.54]Avatar, like the first one.
[220:30.30]And it was a big deal because it was 3D and you get the 3D glasses.
[220:35.05]So someone I know was saying that they went to go see the new Avatar and they're handing out 4D glasses.
[220:39.45]Like they rebrand it 3D because it's like, oh, 3D is kind of lame now.
[220:43.15]So we're going to give them 4D glasses.
[220:45.41]And we were like, that doesn't make any freaking sense.
[220:47.39]And we're like, no, the fourth dimension is time.
[220:49.19]And Avatar takes time to watch.
[220:50.82]It's a 4D.
[220:51.60]But they're not like, it's sure.
[220:53.24]This room is fucked, by the way.
[220:55.02]I don't think we should even go in here.
[220:56.42]Look at all this.
[220:58.24]They can't even move in here.
[220:59.74]The only reason why I bring it up is because I remember it because it's a long movie.
[221:06.65]I think halfway through the movie, I just, I took the glasses off because I was like, I can't fucking stand this anymore.
[221:12.83]I like, my head hurt.
[221:13.87]I kind of felt like ill.
[221:15.65]And I watched, I watched like 20 to 30 minutes of it just all fucked up looking and blurry and spaced out weird.
[221:23.66]I got up and I went just got like snacks and shit.
[221:26.20]I think I walked around the lobby for like 10 minutes.
[221:29.10]I missed like a portion of the whole middle part of the movie.
[221:33.02]And then I kind of went to the bathroom.
[221:35.61]It had to have been at least 10 to 15 minutes that I was not in the seat.
[221:39.51]And then I just put the glasses back on and off.
[221:44.01]Hold on.
[221:44.41]I don't want to die.
[221:46.81]I in intervals would take the glasses on and off and watched it blurry and then watch it in 3D.
[221:52.96]for the rest of like the hour and a half that I was still there.
[221:55.31]I only ever used them like one time and I do kind of remember just like my head and eyes kind of hurt.
[222:11.45]Do you think there'll ever be a period where they'll do VR movies with VR headsets in the seats?
[222:18.53]And there'd be something to watch or something to like participate in.
[222:22.73]I feel like that's the next step.
[222:24.68]And that's probably possible.
[222:25.50]I feel like that's some shit you'd find in like a museum or a zoo.
[222:29.60]Like you go into the zoo experience and like, oh, you can like pet the penguins.
[222:33.32]And they're like, you know, VR zoo experience in the zoo.
[222:36.52]I'm telling you.
[222:37.30]That's the real thing.
[222:38.16]I know it.
[222:38.50]I feel like I've heard of that before from somewhere.
[222:41.24]Avatar 6, you're going to be able to walk around the movie set while the movie happens.
[222:44.50]I'm just telling you that's what's happening.
[222:48.06]There's going to be the movie playing and you're going to be able to just be kind of walking around or just looking at stuff.
[222:53.16]And this is going to be the movie over here.
[222:54.72]That actually sounds kind of cool.
[223:01.92]Hopefully in that future, you go to the theater and you sit down and then like an anesthesiologist comes over and injects LSD into your fucking jugular.
[223:12.99]and instead of watching a movie you all just trip together what's the point of being what's the point of the movie and then on the movie screen the hypno toad from futurama so you say what's up I don't know how to respond to this just like sit everybody in a chair it's like because it's just an experience
[223:35.66]That would be a terrible experience because you, oh yeah, all like, you want a room full of like 50 to 100 people all on LSD?
[223:42.91]How many of them are standing up and like walking around the aisles and shit?
[223:46.77]Like, I don't want to do that.
[223:47.51]I'm not in that.
[223:48.09]I don't want to be in that fucking movie theater.
[223:49.87]You're, oh, you get strapped in.
[223:52.93]What?
[223:53.73]You get strapped into the chair.
[223:55.89]No, I'm not going to this movie.
[223:57.09]And you watch Hypnotoad.
[223:59.19]And a professional drugs you.
[224:01.55]Nope.
[224:02.39]They're a professional.
[224:03.83]Nope.
[224:04.39]Nope.
[224:09.11]I like my VR.
[224:10.47]You walk around like the set that James Cameron made.
[224:13.88]Torture.
[224:18.02]That's weird.
[224:23.38]But would you be able to be heard and seen by other people?
[224:28.90]You can imagine like a big VR chat lobby, just like all yelling shit and screaming at each other while these two actors just talking and the movie's going on.
[224:38.34]That would be hell.
[224:39.06]Now you have like soundproof earmuffs on.
[224:47.22]Ster, you're describing a clockwork orange.
[224:51.20]Oh my god.
[224:52.10]It's a good movie.
[224:54.27]Holy shit.
[224:58.36]god alright so we're kind of we're doing the Minecraft build the wall take the wall down build the wall take the wall down build the wall what do you mean we haven't made any progress we need to let's go we're killing a lot of things I got a lot of loot uh we go we're going this way right this is it's this way we just go up here the stairs and that's where it is it's in like a hallway no I'm telling you right now to your face where it is we got to go this way
[225:25.66]Where are you going?
[225:26.20]Where are you?
[225:26.60]Hello?
[225:26.74]There's an item up here that you didn't get.
[225:30.20]I did.
[225:32.06]I did, though.
[225:32.58]And there's the mega slime.
[225:37.96]Watch out for the mega slime.
[225:39.40]I don't have any mana.
[225:47.73]That's sad.
[225:59.51]If they ever did that, let's say there was, like, Avatar 6, where everyone could put the VR headset on and kind of walk around while the movie was playing out in, like, a 3D space around everybody.
[226:07.95]They definitely would just make it so you couldn't... You had to have, like, the Avatar... Everyone would probably have to be an Avatar, right?
[226:14.36]You'd have to be... Oh, so you would get the point of view of the protagonist.
[226:19.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[226:19.80]I would be, like, a side NPC, and we would all have different points of view.
[226:22.74]And then, like, when the characters are talking, it's like I'm talking to you, but you're, like...
[226:28.41]No.
[226:29.19]No.
[226:29.85]I'm talking about... Watch out!
[226:35.73]Bad guy!
[226:40.85]I'm talking about the movie is just in 3D space.
[226:45.73]The movie is being... is playing.
[226:47.66]And you are just in that space.
[226:50.80]You cannot interact.
[226:51.84]You just can be in the space and see, like, the crazy shit.
[226:55.83]You can walk around in it.
[226:57.56]If somebody's talking... Let's say you got Tom Hanks over here and he's talking to... Who else is in Avatar?
[227:05.26]Whatever.
[227:05.94]Tom Hanks is in Avatar?
[227:07.90]Probably.
[227:08.70]So you got Tom Hanks and there's another person talking.
[227:11.48]And you can just literally leave the room.
[227:14.42]And just go look around the world of Avatar.
[227:17.84]And you can just do whatever you want.
[227:20.43]Oh, so you're saying the movie scene is happening in this room, but you can just leave the room and look at an empty field while the cinematic is going on and you're not even present.
[227:29.28]Can you imagine how different that movie would be from multiple different crazy places you could watch from?
[227:33.72]If there was a big battle, imagine just being like, no, I'm just going to go on the roof of this random building and just watch the battle from there this time.
[227:40.60]Oh, yeah, I can imagine being in the movie of a big battle, an immersive experience of you in the traumatic war movie.
[227:49.32]Like, the avatars are all getting bombed or something.
[227:52.30]Oh, no.
[227:52.68]My, like, Erdtree's burning.
[227:54.30]Whatever their shit is.
[227:56.30]That sounds way better than my idea of, like, putting people on LSD and strapping them in.
[228:04.61]Hold on.
[228:05.01]I don't want to die to this boss.
[228:07.61]I'm in trouble here.
[228:08.31]I like Ster his plan.
[228:13.66]No, you don't.
[228:14.62]Stop.
[228:15.32]Stop.
[228:17.43]that's weird because my plan was not spoken to be liked that's weird that you like oh man that sounds pretty good you mean I got to take lsd and sit and like freak out at a movie theater sign me up well it feels like okay okay it feels a little bit the same where like vr is kind of like the new experimental technology like we're just starting to dabble in vr like why not like also like hard drugs
[228:45.53]But, like, hard drugs start, you know, they're starting to get, like, more accepted, like, psychedelics.
[228:50.94]You know, they're starting to be like, yeah, maybe we should, like, do some psychedelic research.
[228:54.36]You know, they're not, like, they're not the worst.
[228:56.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[228:57.36]And then they start doing public, like, the public can start getting some access to these.
[229:01.62]And we're going to do, like, psychotourism.
[229:05.72]Are you implying that movies are potentially going to get, are getting boring or kind of lame to a point where, like, it's... That's not what I'm saying.
[229:14.39]You just, okay, so take movies out of the equation.
[229:16.73]You're just saying that do drugs in a big group.
[229:19.99]That's your idea.
[229:21.39]That's the idea.
[229:22.67]That's your idea.
[229:24.23]That's just it.
[229:25.81]Yeah, but like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[229:30.32]Alright.
[229:32.08]To be clear, I think you got it.
[229:35.26]So movies have nothing to do with... Movies have nothing to do with our conversation at all.
[229:39.82]From your side here.
[229:40.42]Well, I think they're going to replace movie theaters.
[229:41.84]We're just talking about, like, entertainment that started with, like, VR.
[229:44.72]Oh, okay.
[229:44.98]The same way that, like, VR has the goofy, like, sign up for the VR booth.
[229:48.56]And it's, like, weird.
[229:50.20]You give it a couple years, it's going to be, like, sign up this.
[229:52.76]We're doing LSD at noon.
[229:55.89]I don't think so.
[229:57.53]I think so.
[230:00.19]And you know what?
[230:02.59]That's fine.
[230:03.27]It's funny.
[230:03.81]So VR is a thing now.
[230:06.61]My idea is VR kind of evolves a little and we participate in movies.
[230:11.23]Your idea is VR fails.
[230:13.51]We all do drugs in a room strapped to chairs.
[230:17.44]Where's the logic?
[230:19.00]I got the logic for you right now.
[230:21.24]It's loaded up.
[230:22.48]Are you ready?
[230:23.64]I'm ready.
[230:24.58]I'm a billionaire.
[230:25.94]Earth is boring.
[230:27.94]I'm going to buy a rocket ship company and fly to space.
[230:32.50]That's happening, right?
[230:33.69]And you also have like a lower level of rich persons like I can't buy my own rocket to space.
[230:38.69]I'm going to go to Brazil and find someone to administer ayahuasca to me in the middle of the jungle.
[230:44.13]What if we monetize ayahuasca from the jungle and just brought it into the fucking psychatorium and did it like a movie theater?
[230:53.95]I don't even know what he's saying.
[230:55.97]I don't even know what he's saying.
[230:57.95]Invest.
[230:58.83]Invest.
[231:01.42]Psychatorium coming to your city.
[231:04.08]Dude.
[231:05.66]You're psychatorium me out right now.
[231:09.45]Where's the bonfire?
[231:10.09]Oh, there's a bonfire.
[231:18.35]Alright, let's... You haven't heard of any of these random rich people going to the jungle to do an ayahuasca experience.
[231:27.23]I mean, I hear about... Oh, we're going to do... Yeah, of course I have.
[231:32.13]Yes, of course.
[231:34.29]Of course I have.
[231:35.03]I feel like there's a lot more.
[231:36.22]Of course.
[231:36.82]A lot left unsaid.
[231:38.30]I've been to Brazil.
[231:42.46]Dude, let him cook.
[231:44.18]No, don't let him cook.
[231:46.84]If he cooks it... No!
[231:49.22]Alright, you ready to start this?
[231:52.58]Yeah.
[231:54.27]I love a good festival.
[231:56.21]Let's all strap in.
[231:57.51]Yeah.
[231:59.79]I love a good... Oh, no.
[232:01.43]He's in the chair right now.
[232:02.81]Uh-oh.
[232:05.03]Oh, shit.
[232:05.71]I'm going to the VR room.
[232:06.81]I want nothing to do with this.
[232:08.77]The VR room is lame, dude.
[232:13.52]It's just so funny to me that we're talking about movies, and my thing that I'm saying is you're taking away the visual.
[232:20.18]Just remove the theater part, and it's just everyone do drugs together.
[232:24.85]There's no theater.
[232:25.37]I very deliberately said that the theater is displaying the Futurama Hypnotoad.
[232:33.10]Don't you think that would just freak everybody out?
[232:35.06]Like who, you don't know if it's like, oh, everybody, let's all just stare at this on LSD for four hours.
[232:40.89]Well, then we can pull it back and it can just be like, I don't know, a room like a singular room around here.
[232:46.99]I don't I don't know if there's like a Texas thing.
[232:49.37]There are so many weird build.
[232:51.25]I don't know what they do, but it's like come in here for your like your health clinic, like personal, like carbon digital health, digital health clinic.
[233:00.41]And they're like really pristine places that have like nothing in them.
[233:04.07]If you just look in the glass, it's just like a table with one person at it.
[233:08.03]I don't know what they're doing in there.
[233:11.87]I don't know what they're doing in there.
[233:14.44]Like expensive area.
[233:18.04]There's never anyone goes in.
[233:20.48]No one ever comes out.
[233:22.90]I've never heard of this.
[233:25.33]I don't know I've I've never heard of this digital health there's also like a cryogenics place like around here is it are you sure they're not sure it's not like a hospital no okay alright I don't know cartel money laundry there is a place near here I I honestly think a legitimate large amount of places you have to be invested in like money laundering there is
[233:50.18]a drive-through jewelry store this place has a fucking open drive-through who is driving through it's like a like a expensive ass like k's jeweler kind of like oh just drive through pick up your jewelry no problem there is some fucking like hey but like hey money being exchanged there's something going on what if you just want like a quick pair of earrings or something uh
[234:18.17]Got you.
[234:18.53]I'm in a hurry.
[234:19.47]I'm in a hurry.
[234:20.47]Got you.
[234:21.79]Again.
[234:22.09]I don't know.
[234:23.53]Never seen anyone.
[234:24.43]Never seen anyone go to that place ever.
[234:28.47]Alright.
[234:29.05]Can we play?
[234:29.85]Can we beat Redan, please?
[234:31.23]A guy in my chat says it's extremely all caps.
[234:34.57]It's extremely common.
[234:36.19]Nice.
[234:36.83]Nice.
[234:37.15]Announce your privilege to my chat.
[234:38.48]Get the fuck out of here.
[234:39.94]Where is Redan?
[234:40.74]Why can't we activate the festival?
[234:42.12]What are we doing?
[234:43.30]Oh, God.
[234:43.96]Somebody stop him.
[234:47.57]We have to go down the elevator.
[234:50.69]Where's the elevator?
[234:53.95]It's usually behind this guy.
[234:55.07]He won't open the door.
[234:56.85]It's behind him.
[234:59.26]The festival will be declared.
[235:00.44]He says it's not happening yet.
[235:01.80]How do we do this?
[235:04.30]We have to go to Alta Splata.

[236:34.81]Never mind.
[236:35.17]You know what?
[236:35.47]Never mind.
[236:35.85]Uh-oh.
[236:38.30]He's turning.
[236:40.00]You don't have to believe in me.
[236:41.68]I'm just going to start up a small little company.
[236:44.28]It'll be called, like, Tesla or something.
[236:45.94]You'll hear about it.
[236:49.96]No one will believe in it.
[236:51.20]And then I'll, like, post some memes on the internet.
[236:52.95]And, like, way more people will invest than the company makes money.
[236:56.09]Alright.
[236:57.25]Now the video cuts.
[236:59.61]And it's a news report.
[237:02.05]Local streamer Ster has been arrested for setting up an illegal LSD torture chamber.
[237:07.85]He has been arrested and he is now going to be in prison for the rest of his life.
[237:13.13]Where I'm going to continue to try and expand my operation.
[237:23.54]Authorities have said that we have no idea what the hell this man was thinking when he decided to do this.
[237:28.87]It was one of the most unreal ideas we've ever heard.
[237:33.62]Again, more unreal than like digging a tunnel only for Teslas.
[237:48.53]Where are we going?
[237:49.79]I need you guys.
[237:50.68]I put you at the wheel and we have not fought Radon.
[237:53.06]You put me at the wheel and then you started screaming in my ear while I was driving.
[237:59.34]Scream stream.
[238:00.94]I think you should actually do a scream stream.
[238:04.95]Are you on drugs right now?
[238:06.13]Alright, let's go.
[238:08.13]Were you yesterday?
[238:15.41]Alright, so here's the deal.
[238:16.97]We are gonna go to the... Where do we... How do we get here?
[238:20.09]I don't know how to get out of here.
[238:21.59]What do you mean you don't know how to get out of here?
[238:27.65]We need the medallions, but we can go through... Wait!
[238:30.87]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[238:32.15]We can go... We can go here.
[238:34.88]Yeah, right... No, no, no.
[238:35.92]Right below that.
[238:36.76]The road.
[238:37.38]I have the medallion for that lift.
[238:39.18]Wait, you do?
[238:39.84]I thought you... Yeah.
[238:41.22]Oh!
[238:41.34]Alright, yeah.
[238:41.72]So let's go.
[238:42.02]We can just follow the road.
[238:43.34]Follow the road.
[238:44.41]So a main Academy gate or can you do another?
[238:48.17]Because the bridge is broken.
[238:49.11]The bridge is broken, so we need to go all the way up the right or you need to.
[238:53.58]Yeah.
[238:57.82]I think we actually do have to go up this way.
[239:00.00]Yeah, I think we have to do the whole right path.
[239:03.76]Because everything there is a cliff.
[239:07.51]The bridge is not broken.
[239:08.43]I think we can just go over.
[239:09.17]OK, the bridge is not broken.
[239:14.72]There's a teleporter on the bridge.
[239:15.94]Cool.
[239:16.30]Yeah.
[239:23.33]Oh, my stomach.
[239:30.38]A movie length car wash in VR is the future.
[239:36.12]movie length car wait you go to the car wash and you put it you put a vr headset on I feel like I entertain you while you're going through the car wash and like while you're going through they're like taking the tires off your car
[239:48.18]You're getting robbed if you do that, by the way.
[239:50.46]Yeah, it's like, yeah, just put this headset on.
[239:53.67]Come to the car cleaner.
[239:55.67]Come on in.
[239:56.93]You're just like sitting there.
[239:58.27]All your shit's gone.
[240:00.03]What I was going to say is all the paint is going to get stripped off your car.
[240:03.83]Your car's going to be fucked up after that.
[240:05.78]It's going to be dense everywhere.
[240:06.76]All the paint's going to be gone.
[240:07.84]Holy shit, man.
[240:10.60]Like a three-hour movie of just your car being washed.
[240:13.52]Your car's going to be fucked up.
[240:15.70]Oh, we have the key, so we can do this.
[240:23.26]The stream has gone completely unhinged.
[240:25.52]Yeah, it has.
[240:27.19]Well, don't worry.
[240:27.83]We'll get back on the road.
[240:28.91]We will.
[240:29.33]It's inevitable.
[240:30.23]We always do.
[240:30.87]We always get back on the road.
[240:43.84]Yeah, we're getting, we're back on the road.
[240:46.52]We took a wrong exit.
[240:48.02]We're calm, relaxed.
[240:50.10]We're done talking about anything at all.
[240:54.28]It's all been banned.
[241:00.34]Do you get an item for this?
[241:02.36]No.
[241:07.91]We just have to go across here and we will activate it.
[241:10.63]It's knight cavalry.
[241:13.12]Let's actually, we probably beat this pretty easily now.
[241:14.74]Yeah, they're like not replaced.
[241:18.94]That's kind of weird that they're not random.
[241:21.76]That is weird.
[241:27.91]I thought I was you for a second inside of that.
[241:31.15]I mean, it is horse combat.
[241:41.23]oh it does a lot I can't there's so much there's so much fire light on the screen I can't see anything horses we've been killing the horse the whole time that's fine
[242:13.25]Once he falls, we just got to really rip into him.
[242:17.13]Rip and tear.
[242:17.83]He's about to fall off.
[242:20.65]Or run away.
[242:22.19]One of the two.
[242:22.97]Alright, he's off.
[242:51.34]uh the lock on yeah the lock that lock on bug is annoying I couldn't walk onto him and it got weird yeah it keeps like dumping it I keep just like
[243:18.36]There we go.
[243:23.00]And.
[243:23.20]Ooh, Somber Smithing Stone two.
[243:29.74]How come Ster streams at 1080p 60 FPS and you don't?
[243:34.06]Because Ster doesn't understand the quality versus bitrate thing.
[243:43.14]What?
[243:44.36]What do you stream at? 864.
[243:48.10]You stream it like one of the weird numbers, right?
[243:49.86]Yeah.
[243:51.09]Yeah, I did that for a bit.
[243:52.17]And then like my settings reset and I forgot what number I was doing.
[243:54.95]So I just went back to like default.
[243:58.67]Stop thinking.
[243:59.23]But yeah, I understand that what Jerma is doing is correct.
[244:02.39]And you're just trying to find things that aren't correct.
[244:06.20]But this one is correct.
[244:09.18]There you go.
[244:13.00]Case closed.
[244:18.62]These work?
[244:20.54]Oh, no.
[244:20.84]The crab is trying to work them.
[244:23.54]I think... The crab is being catapulted.
[244:28.46]He might actually... Yeah, you want to take a look at this.
[244:33.13]I don't see a crab.
[244:36.39]I think he's gone.
[244:38.03]Yeah, he didn't make it.
[244:41.05]He didn't make it.
[244:52.93]Oh, I just got urgent heal.
[244:56.06]Do you want that?
[244:59.60]Just hold on to it until I switch.
[245:02.99]If I do.
[245:03.43]Oh.
[245:07.48]to stream at the best settings?
[245:09.04]Well, if the thing about streaming is if you go over, if you go over 6,000 bit rate, then I believe you are considered to be, that's not allowed.
[245:22.63]I think that there are some cases maybe where, I don't know, maybe where they allow some maybe events to do it.
[245:28.37]I don't know.
[245:29.09]I have heard of an individual streamer who was like granted the privilege to get like 10K bit rate.
[245:35.49]It is like a very rare thing.
[245:39.41]Everything I've ever heard or been told is that anything over 6,000 is considered like against terms of service.
[245:46.20]Okay, well, I have also heard that, but I also used to stream at 8k for quite a while.
[245:50.60]I have no idea.
[245:53.22]But if for some reason there was ever the ability to, oh, hey, no, no, no, no, no.
[245:58.02]Everybody can stream at like up to 20k or up to like 15k.
[246:01.70]I would do 1080p.
[246:04.29]Yeah, I think now it actually like basically gets throttled that it really doesn't let you go above and it used to let you go a little bit above.
[246:12.48]I don't know.
[246:13.10]It's all weird.
[246:14.24]Where do you use the medallion?
[246:15.38]I think it's right here.
[246:17.30]I think it's this one.
[246:19.16]Is this the right lift or did I mislead us?
[246:24.39]um this should be I have rolls rolls medallion is this not right rolls royce it's the wrong medallion I think chat correct me if I'm wrong we can go through here can we oh yeah this is uh this is the dectus I don't I only have the left for dectus we can go in the tunnel and up right yeah alright follow me yeah I know I know where we're going then you don't have any of the symbols or the I don't think so
[246:54.47]No, I don't have any of them.
[247:00.86]The one you have is for Leyndell.
[247:12.22]Hope this doesn't hurt.
[247:12.96]Nice.
[247:19.69]Smithing Stone 1.
[247:26.67]Stop off that.
[247:30.72]You have to go down through the waterway.
[247:32.56]Yeah.
[247:32.92]From the lake.
[247:35.70]Or we could... Let's go up into the capital.
[247:40.76]We should kill Redan.
[247:43.03]You mean... I really do want to kill Redan.
[247:47.55]Let's just get the bonfire up here.
[247:49.41]Okay.
[247:50.23]Wait.
[247:52.57]I guess we could talk to Ronnie.
[247:53.73]Okay.
[247:56.31]Which I just go up here again.
[247:59.31]Do you think you?
[248:00.61]Yeah, I was going to ask whatever.
[248:03.58]I'm being a weirdo.
[248:09.86]Where do we talk to her?
[248:10.86]What are we doing?
[248:11.60]I don't know.
[248:12.20]I haven't talked to her once this whole playthrough, so I have no idea where she is now.
[248:16.59]I think you talked to you talk to her first, right?
[248:19.19]And then I don't know where she is now at her.
[248:20.55]Her tower.
[248:23.83]I think she's at the tower, like her tower, which is here somewhere, right?
[248:28.59]Isn't it like up here?
[248:29.26]Yeah.
[248:35.32]Yeah, she has the tower next to her puppet man.
[248:38.84]Now I would be her puppet, you know.
[248:45.01]Given the chance.
[248:48.63]Ronnie will probably take even longer.
[248:49.87]Yeah, whatever.
[248:54.38]Not in any rush or anything.
[249:11.88]I am going to request a bathroom pee break very soon here though.
[249:16.68]Okay, I could really use one of those as well for my bladder pees.
[249:54.25]Oh yeah, you can ride the horse up here.
[249:57.40]You really shouldn't be able to, but... Should you go pee?
[250:03.42]I will.
[250:04.70]After we get this situated.
[250:16.70]Jeremy, you've spent 19 years sleeping.
[250:24.00]What?
[250:25.82]Somebody do the math on that.
[250:30.41]Let's say you sleep six to eight hours a night.
[250:33.77]Let's say seven hours average, right?
[250:35.29]Six to seven hours average.
[250:38.31]I'm 37.
[250:38.83]So that's... Somebody do that math.
[250:48.61]How many years have I been asleep?
[250:53.29]The third of your whole life.
[250:55.59]How long have I been asleep for?
[250:59.37]12.3 years.
[251:00.14]I've slept for 12.3 years.
[251:05.30]I don't like that statistic.
[251:08.80]That makes me feel like life is passing by.
[251:11.06]12 years.
[251:11.24]I was asleep for 12 years of sleep.
[251:17.22]yeah wake up wake up 12.3 years asleep how many years have you spent pissing that's another crazy one yeah okay somebody calculate all of this if you spend 45 minutes in the bathroom every time you go and you go how many times a day you're going
[251:40.87]Wait, we need to do this very, very... Hold on.
[251:45.47]Let's say it takes me between 15 to 60 seconds to piss.
[251:50.33]Sometimes it's a big one.
[251:51.79]Let's just say on average it's like... I thought we went over this that you spend 40 minutes in the bathroom.
[251:56.69]But just hold on.
[251:58.33]Peeing only.
[252:00.09]Oh my god, this is going to be so scary.
[252:01.99]Okay, you guys ready?
[252:02.73]Let's do it.
[252:06.05]This is more important than playing the game.
[252:07.17]I don't care about the game.
[252:07.77]Just go.
[252:08.15]You go do whatever you want to do.
[252:08.99]I'm talking to the people.
[252:09.87]You are... You're doing great.
[252:13.12]If it's about 15 seconds to do a piss, right?
[252:17.70]About 15, maybe 10 to 15?
[252:19.30]No.
[252:20.56]How many times a day do you pee?
[252:23.44]I'm a chronic pee counter.
[252:27.71]No, continue.
[252:28.94]I was waiting for you to say the rest.
[252:30.92]What is that?
[252:31.96]Sometimes when I... I don't know, when I was young... Definitely not anymore.
[252:36.98]When I know that it's going to be a real big pee, I'll just count it.
[252:40.48]Okay.
[252:41.06]Like, how much pee is this?
[252:42.85]And sometimes, you know, sometimes you hit a minute, dude.
[252:45.71]I feel like I pee... It depends, but if I'm talking about an average, let's say it's five... I feel like I pee every... Three to five hours?
[252:54.49]What if you're going for an average...
[252:57.34]then you also need to, you need to factor in the long peas.
[253:01.77]That's not just the minimum.
[253:02.77]Yeah, okay.
[253:03.39]Okay.
[253:03.79]Okay.
[253:04.31]This needs to be accurate.
[253:05.69]So if it's, let's say you pee every IP probably every depends on the day, but like, maybe every two to five hours, every two, three, four hours, maybe.
[253:15.37]I feel like every couple of hours to four hours, I'm gonna say three hours average, maybe.
[253:23.38]3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 20.
[253:23.88]So let's say I pee 7 to 10 times a day.
[253:25.06]6 to 10 times a day.
[253:25.66]We're going to say like 7.
[253:26.38]Is that pretty accurate?
[253:28.04]So if I pee 7 times a day, times like 25 seconds.
[253:30.28]So 7 times 25 is what?
[253:30.80]That's a lot?
[253:33.18]7 sounds like a lot to me.
[253:33.88]Is it?
[253:53.46]I'm going to go pee right now.
[253:56.26]I'm going to go pee when the stream is over.
[253:59.54]I mean, I probably also pee a lot.
[254:01.38]I've been drinking a lot of water.
[254:02.50]I've been hydrating.
[254:03.36]Maybe these people are like... I do drink a lot of water.
[254:06.82]I do.
[254:07.12]I drink... I don't want to call it a lot of water, but I mean, over the course of a day, I definitely have at least six to eight ounces of glasses of water a day.
[254:17.93]I have like six to eight ounce glasses of water a day.
[254:23.30]I think it would be fair.
[254:24.36]Let's just say five or six then.
[254:29.88]Let's just say seven.
[254:30.80]I'm going to say seven because I feel like six... I'm going to say six.
[254:33.32]Six.
[254:34.30]Six times 25 is what?
[254:36.16]Seconds.
[254:40.22]Okay, I think I did the quest and I'm going to go pee.
[254:42.98]Alright, you go.
[254:43.74]We're working through this.
[254:45.32]Yeah, figure out how long it takes me and then factor that in.
[254:48.32]So it's about 37 to 47 days is how long you've peed
[254:54.63]A year?
[254:55.01]No.
[254:57.37]I thought you meant a year.
[254:58.23]That would be fucked up.
[255:00.79]So 47... How many... I'm 37 years old.
[255:05.11]So two and a half minutes a day.
[255:08.43]How is that over 37 years?
[255:14.61]So it would be that.
[255:16.41]So 27 days.
[255:16.71]Okay.
[255:16.85]Okay.
[255:26.62]We said I got 27 days.
[255:30.32]OK, let's say 27 days and then let's do the other one.
[255:34.70]The other, you know, number two.
[255:38.96]I would say probably I this is weird to talk about on stream.
[255:43.94]I'm just going to call it something else.
[255:47.69]I'm going to combine a few because like I've probably puked a bunch in the bathroom too.
[255:51.74]So let's do.
[255:52.44]Alright.
[255:53.06]How long?
[255:53.66]I'm going to say a day.
[255:55.84]I probably spend about and like showering and like brushing my teeth.
[256:00.73]I'm going to combine everything.
[256:04.51]Maybe like 45 minutes to an hour a day.
[256:08.53]Total.
[256:09.85]Total.
[256:12.66]I would say at least one hour a day is spent cleaning, you know, showering, brushing my teeth, going to the bathroom.
[256:23.53]Sometimes if you're in there a little longer, probably an hour a day.
[256:27.51]So one hour a day, this 20, so one, it's 37 years.
[256:31.29]Well, how many days is that?
[256:34.19]No, I'm saying total across the whole day being in the bathroom.
[256:36.47]That's showers.
[256:37.29]That's, you know, the other thing that I've even said.
[256:52.24]1.3 years.
[256:58.24]So it's one and a half years.
[256:59.31]So then, so let's just, let's just round up to the one.
[257:02.57]So one and a half years, I've been going to the bathroom or showering.
[257:07.57]I've showered for like a year.
[257:10.92]No, I've been on the toilet for a year and a half.
[257:21.38]Jesus.
[257:23.03]Plus the other stuff.
[257:23.83]So I've spent like 15 years of my life sleeping, brushing my teeth, shitting, puking, sleeping, or taking a shower.
[257:39.71]I'll be back.
[258:12.07]Wow.
[258:13.31]I was muted.
[258:14.59]I said, don't tell me this isn't an interesting conversation, because it's a very interesting conversation to know how long you've been doing something over the course of your entire life.
[258:21.05]It's an interesting conversation.
[258:23.05]And I'm going to mute you.
[258:23.81]Okay.
[258:25.57]Because now it's my turn, and I'm muting you.
[258:28.76]Now it's your turn.
[258:29.52]I don't trust you.
[258:31.44]While you're gone, I might say... He's gone.
[258:33.76]Nope.
[258:34.50]Goodbye.
[258:35.32]Goodbye.
[258:35.78]See you later.
[258:36.12]Alright, I'll be right back.
[262:52.14]I'm gonna start doing that from now on when I come back I'm just gonna very gently and lightly just kind of go so people go oh he's back instead of being like hey what is this title one and a half years in the bathroom I didn't make this title you still in the bathroom
[263:20.02]You're telling me you just spent 15 seconds peeing.
[263:22.50]No, actually, I did time it.
[263:23.74]Did you time yours?
[263:26.40]No.
[263:27.14]How could you have not timed it when we were just talking about it?
[263:30.73]I really, like, didn't feel the need to.
[263:35.25]I feel like I have enough data.
[263:37.33]I've done the work.
[263:38.61]Mine was exactly, almost exactly 20 seconds.
[263:44.88]Okay.
[263:45.54]That's short.
[263:46.16]That's actually very short for how long we've been, you know, going.
[263:51.91]you staying hydrated there?
[263:53.45]Yeah.
[263:55.15]I mean, I I did do a big old pee.
[263:58.97]Alright, let's stop this and move on.
[264:03.19]Now, whichever kind of pasta ever cut an onion.
[264:08.48]Alright, we're gonna go to that cave.
[264:12.66]What cave?
[264:13.52]Because I did the Ronnie thing.
[264:15.00]I think Oh, we'll start Oh, does it?
[264:17.44]Well, how can we did you get a cutscene?
[264:20.36]No, what cutscene are you supposed to get?
[264:22.42]Don't you get a cutscene before Redan's there?
[264:26.68]No, I think we have to... I don't know.
[264:28.49]I don't remember ever getting a cutscene, except for maybe when you go there and they talk about the festival.
[264:33.31]Let's warp there.
[264:33.97]Let's warp there.
[264:35.01]Let's warp there right now.
[264:35.81]Right into the plaza?
[264:37.35]Yeah.
[264:38.27]Alright.
[264:56.55]Did you count in thousands or Mississippis?
[265:01.21]Just one, two, three, four, five, six.
[265:09.64]Did it happen?
[265:10.20]Aren't they usually out here?
[265:11.36]No.
[265:12.10]We're going to go up to Altus Plateau.
[265:15.60]We can go back down through the river and climb up that way.
[265:20.19]What's the best bonfire to sit at to do that?
[265:24.21]We'd have to start, like, all the way at that Vakaria gate.
[265:29.25]And just go down to the left.
[265:31.32]Like here.
[265:34.18]Let's do that.
[265:36.90]I don't think you can go down here.
[265:38.18]You can't?
[265:44.23]I don't think so.
[265:45.09]I think we have to go all the way...
[266:06.92]That way it works.
[266:09.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[266:10.03]No, I know a better one.
[266:11.13]I know a better one.
[266:11.91]I know a better one.
[266:12.77]Yeah, I know a better one.
[266:13.69]I hope this is right.
[266:19.87]People go down into the lake and... People are saying a certain place to go to.
[266:33.88]Well, I'm saying a certain place.
[266:36.94]Do you want to go do the turtles?
[266:41.83]Alright.
[266:44.95]So your plan is to go from here and then down and go duck.
[266:48.03]I see.
[266:49.33]Oh, sorry.
[266:49.73]I left first.
[266:50.33]I forget sometimes like you load in later.
[266:53.87]Yeah, you are the host.
[266:54.73]It is.
[266:55.21]I have an extended loading screen more than you do.
[267:15.93]You don't want to go pet turtles?
[267:19.79]I love how you're the one that wants to pet the turtles, but you're the one that's been killing the turtles the whole time we've been playing.
[267:24.61]I killed one turtle.
[267:26.36]One too many.
[267:30.28]What is... Zeus?
[267:36.02]Yeah, what is doing that?
[267:41.16]This area looks weird.
[267:45.22]In it?
[267:47.42]I went backwards.
[267:51.03]You did just go in the complete... Why was I following you?
[267:54.55]I just assumed you were going the right way.
[267:56.43]I was distracted by the Zeus.
[268:05.58]We were just vibing.
[268:06.68]Hey, I'll tell you.
[268:08.66]Vibes have been pretty good tonight.
[268:10.82]Would you say that?
[268:12.98]I thought the vibes were good yesterday as well.
[268:15.02]And if you're trying to like compare, like you're saying for you, the vibe was off.
[268:18.73]Vibe was not off for me.
[268:20.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[268:21.35]The vibes were off and on only at the very last 30 to 40 minutes of that of the stream.
[268:26.81]You know what I mean?
[268:28.51]Like when we couldn't beat the vibes were kind of off.
[268:32.05]The vibes were on the entire time.
[268:34.90]Except for the last 30 minutes, vibes were off.
[268:38.27]vibes been on this whole entire time how how do you feel the vibes would be just out of curiosity if uh every time we entered a boss room we like beat it first try is that like good vibes or is that like this is a little bit too like we're too good they need to stop us I feel like how good we are I feel like the vibes would be
[269:03.01]not great but uh there's one kind of in parentheses after that okay vibes not great but this is randomizer and it's possible that we just absolutely just power stack our weapons crazy and there's like a mad soldier in one of these rooms right yeah that's not that's only happened once we're getting a lot of like actual bosses they gotta be running out of them yeah
[269:34.14]You gotta be running out of salamanders at some point.
[269:36.28]And then put the other parenthesis bracket around it, whatever.
[269:41.82]Vibe's not great, but this is randomize the puzzle.
[269:43.62]We just power stack our weapons.
[269:45.14]There's a mad soldier in this room.
[269:48.57]Is that the new stream title?
[269:50.29]That should be the stream title, if I'm really honest.
[269:54.29]That should be the title.
[270:03.07]God, so stupid.
[270:08.34]Someone should just build a ladder here.
[270:12.86]I got another seed.
[270:26.34]Did you get the golden seed there?
[270:28.27]It is not a golden seed for me.
[270:29.73]It's been a golden seed.
[270:31.92]I'm not kidding that's why you you you were getting golden seeds from those yeah I'm getting smithing stones from them that's why my weapon is plus 28. so that's what's been going on alright I want to see what's in this back area see if there's any consumable items picking up bears on the wall
[271:00.89]There is a bear in the wall.
[271:06.03]It's got like a fire buff.
[271:09.57]Okay, that's all.
[271:10.39]Is it a good title?
[271:34.75]a very confusing title if you're not currently here right now oh that's scary
[272:18.76]You get it?
[272:19.12]Yeah, I got that Mowglike.
[272:21.08]I was kind of hoping that you were just going to fall on your back by the screen.
[272:24.70]That would have been funny.
[272:36.87]Somebody said, I've been having the stream in the background and I have this weird subliminal message of wanting smoothies.
[272:41.65]Did you do something?
[272:43.74]It was something.
[272:44.70]You said something like that.
[272:45.94]I just paraphrased your entire comment.
[272:52.66]It was in that same ballpark.
[272:53.96]It was that same world.
[273:04.57]I think we gotta go up this ladder that's not even real this ladder goes up watch out there's goons in here actually this place is way worse usually oh cool I found uh on the traps
[273:31.99]Is this the place where there's that big centipede bug thing?
[273:36.50]No, there's a million little baby boys and they all throw poison at you.
[273:40.38]Oh, okay.
[273:41.72]And there's like a bunch of traps on the ground as you run away from them.
[273:45.89]Is there an item?
[273:47.45]I think there is.
[273:48.03]Yeah, there's an item.
[273:49.91]It's going to be dung.
[273:51.95]It's going to be like a glass shard.
[273:58.76]I remember my Elden Ring playthrough I was saying there's a lot of like moments like that where it's like oh you missed the item going up the elevator to just like to make you take longer to do something and then you go get it and it's like oh you found like I don't know nothing I got a Giant-Crusher the weapon called Giant-Crusher
[274:19.57]I think the point is sometimes the journey is more important than the destination.
[274:24.55]So it's being able to actually see that there's something cool for you to do with any kind of reward is an interesting concept because it makes you feel like that you've done a good job paying attention to the game's environment.
[274:40.97]And I just got the axe of Godrick.
[274:43.35]Changing character immediately.
[274:46.05]Again.
[274:49.14]This guy cannot use an item for more than 30 seconds.
[274:57.09]I think that was a pretty good way to explain that.
[274:58.57]Do you want like a crossbow or anything?
[275:11.40]No.
[275:15.04]Why not?
[275:22.50]Did you need a somber 7 or a 6?
[275:26.14]I think a 6.
[275:27.47]You're at 5, so you need a 6.
[275:28.91]Yeah, I need a 6.
[275:29.31]Did you just get a 7?
[275:32.23]Yeah.
[275:33.07]I have a 7.
[275:34.71]Yeah, I think we're both in the same situation where I think I need 7s of regular.
[275:41.77]I need a 6 and an 8.
[275:43.13]And then the final one, and I just think it'd be plus 10.
[275:46.63]I think I have an 8.
[275:51.86]No, I don't.
[275:54.18]Everything's wrong.
[275:54.90]I want whatever that is.
[276:15.80]Slider goes up.
[276:22.05]I need to rest.
[276:23.63]Nah, the poison's almost over.
[276:25.89]We were just at a bonfire right before we came through here.
[276:29.51]They got a purple item for me.
[276:33.31]Battle!
[276:35.81]I would refill my mana.
[276:41.76]That's true.
[276:43.32]Oh, shit.
[276:49.52]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[276:56.68]Oh, what's up?
[276:57.52]What else is here?
[277:09.15]Well, it's a little scary.
[277:10.99]I think it's a free kill though.
[277:27.32]I didn't fall.
[277:46.47]Uh huh.
[277:48.59]See what I'm dealing with here?
[277:49.36]I see what you're dealing with here.
[278:02.02]A lot of souls.
[278:10.40]There is an item up here.
[278:12.65]Should definitely come up here.
[278:14.55]I'm.
[278:14.69]Wait, how do you get up there?
[278:18.75]Around the left side.
[278:20.89]Over in the rocks.
[278:23.30]it's a poopy normal item oh I'm getting it I'm getting it it's gonna be like a spell it's gonna be like Godrick's last gall but again this is another place I didn't know you can come up here you're really teaching me a lot I'm really learned I'm really educated right now
[278:52.71]Is there a mod they're using for seamless co-op?
[278:54.55]Yes.
[278:56.03]Seamless co-op.
[278:59.07]I'm going to sing the praises of this mod another time.
[279:03.42]Randomizer was hard to set up just because it's like, oh, match the right seed and get all these things in the right folders and make sure you set the right settings.
[279:11.42]Seamless co-op is literally two files.
[279:17.50]You don't have to do anything else besides just get the foot over passwords.
[279:22.40]It's probably the easiest mod I've ever installed.
[279:26.83]I've ever used.
[279:29.33]Would you say the same thing, Ster?
[279:30.17]Yeah.
[279:32.33]It gets a little bit complicated when you're trying to have exactly the same mods like the randomizer.
[279:36.37]Yeah.
[279:37.05]But the actual seamless co-op is just like a file in game folder done.
[279:42.10]It's actually insane.
[279:46.76]I was concerned when we first started talking about this.
[279:48.90]I was concerned that, oh man, this is a whole ordeal, isn't it?
[279:52.73]This is a whole thing.
[279:55.13]See, I felt bad too because I kind of turned it into a whole ordeal.
[279:58.21]No, how did you?
[280:00.23]It was exactly what you were trying to avoid.
[280:02.08]But how would you have known, right?
[280:03.46]There's no way you would have known.
[280:07.39]Please just let me feel bad.
[280:08.83]No.
[280:09.95]Step on me.
[280:11.19]No.
[280:12.71]It's undeserved.
[280:14.45]It's undeserved.
[280:17.34]There's no way you would have known that with these two things together and the amount of trying to figure it, we had to figure it out.
[280:28.53]I really do, um, I mentioned it yesterday and then you, like, ignored me and then didn't hear me and probably just, like, spit on the ground on your stream.
[280:37.24]Yep.
[280:37.64]But I've heard, I've heard... Yeah, I don't... It could be a good one.
[280:43.40]What if it's a legendary?
[280:44.10]What if you missed it?
[280:44.76]Yeah, okay.
[280:48.87]Lump of flesh.
[280:50.91]Sorry I made you do that.
[280:52.99]Uh, I was gonna say, like, I don't know if you want to try Neo 2 sometimes because I did hear it was really good and it also has, like...
[280:58.65]The co-op just kind of works.
[281:03.59]I tried to play Nioh a few times.
[281:06.87]Just on my own time.
[281:08.03]I just didn't like all the stance switching stuff.
[281:12.81]Yeah, I was a little annoyed by how overly complicated it was too.
[281:17.49]I'm not sure if that's still a thing.
[281:21.39]I was a little exhausted by that as well.
[281:24.71]I just want, I just want light attack, heavy attack.
[281:27.49]You can call me just an absolute small brain Andy.
[281:29.63]That's fine.
[281:30.69]But like, I just want to swing, regular swing, strong swing, and the weapons are cool.
[281:36.55]It's just, I don't like the stances, like up, down, you know, the stance, that stance, that stance.
[281:47.75]It's definitely really cool.
[281:51.01]It just gives you more tools to play with, but I want less tools.
[281:55.31]And if that makes me a dope, then so be it.
[281:58.65]No, that makes sense.
[281:59.80]I agree with you.
[282:00.60]It was a lot.
[282:06.88]It's weird to say that because Dark Souls isn't a casual experience, but Nioh was even less of a casual experience.
[282:16.23]Where does Nioh sit where like Sekiro?
[282:21.42]Like is Nioh harder than Sekiro?
[282:23.74]Is Nioh kind of more kind of challenging and more skill based than Sekiro was?
[282:30.87]I didn't play a lot.
[282:31.79]I don't know.
[282:32.67]It's harder than Sekiro.
[282:34.73]Really?
[282:35.05]Oh my goodness.
[282:36.63]I don't think I remember it being very hard.
[282:39.59]And it has like a whole, I think Neo2 has like a whole like end game loot finding, like find like item stuff and farming and whatnot.
[282:49.44]So I imagine it just keeps getting harder.
[282:51.20]Sekiro is easier to be honest.
[282:53.73]Huh?
[282:56.73]Wow.
[283:03.53]What's that?
[283:05.05]Is that a fist weapon?
[283:10.83]It is.
[283:11.91]Star fist?
[283:18.46]Holy shit, these are cool.
[283:20.58]What?
[283:21.04]This is awesome.
[283:23.02]Time to change.
[283:33.46]Nioh is more bullshit difficulty than anything.
[283:38.75]It looks really fun.
[283:40.01]It looks really cool.
[283:41.01]I just... I tried to play it a few times.
[283:44.47]I just... That... The first zone... I just... I leave at the same point in the first zone every time.
[283:53.08]After, like, the first hour to two hours... Like, almost... I want to say up to three hours.
[283:57.04]It's like, eh, no, I'm not into this.
[283:58.76]And I leave.
[284:03.31]Did I miss an item?
[284:03.93]It is kind of bullshit.
[284:05.07]I feel like this conversation is actually turning me more like I've been wanting to play it.
[284:09.65]I bought it.
[284:10.99]And this conversation is like, you know what?
[284:13.35]Maybe not.
[284:14.31]I really do feel like and if it is bullshit difficulty, I don't know.
[284:18.52]Well, how does Nioh 1 compare to Nioh 2?
[284:22.28]Is Nioh 2 like a better, less bullshit kind of better game?
[284:28.65]I think they were saying that.
[284:30.97]They're saying it's way better, though.
[284:33.87]Like, it's way, way better.
[284:35.65]I heard it was very good.
[284:36.81]Because around the time that, like, I finished Elden Ring, there was a lot of comments on Nioh 2, like, the reviews on Steam that were like, yeah, I beat Elden Ring, and I need it.
[284:46.62]I, like, need it more.
[284:48.68]So we all came here, and this game's actually pretty good.
[284:54.67]So the Magma Wyrm is supposed to be up here, but I wonder if it's not a Magma Wyrm.
[285:00.05]I hope it's a Magma Wyrm.
[285:03.71]That would make me very happy if it were a Magma Wyrm.
[285:05.81]I hope I just didn't break something.
[285:17.34]Are we getting a cutscene or am I computer crashing?
[285:21.06]You might be computer crashing.
[285:22.64]Yep.
[285:26.02]Okay, I'm going to beat the boss.
[285:29.17]Don't go in.
[285:30.27]Don't do the boss reveal.
[285:31.47]Randomize your boss reveal without the other player.
[285:33.67]That's BM.
[285:40.99]Oh my god, it's Elden Beast!
[285:47.12]Sounds cool.
[285:51.38]And then you beat it and the game ends.
[286:02.02]I think I crashed again.
[286:04.96]On startup this time, weird.
[286:10.93]Did you use the right launcher?
[286:12.17]Yeah.
[286:14.91]This is hard crashed.
[286:18.33]Okay, let's try that again.
[286:41.90]Come on.
[286:46.06]Come on.
[286:56.99]Please.
[287:03.54]Uh-oh.
[287:04.24]Okay, no, good.
[287:04.85]Thank God.
[287:05.27]It looked like it crashed again, but I'm good.
[287:08.31]I'm coming back.
[287:24.05]Uh, can you put a new one of those thingies down?
[287:31.82]I did.
[287:48.98]I feel bad for that version of my character.
[287:51.66]Because they're just going to get their ass kicked.
[287:55.48]Okay.
[287:57.16]I think what happened is we both sat down and we both... I had touch Grace was on my indicator.
[288:03.67]And I think we both did it at the exact same time.
[288:05.65]And I think it crashed me.
[288:06.67]Okay.
[288:16.64]I can't believe this is Elden Beast.
[288:18.58]Don't go in yet.
[288:23.42]I have too many souls and I want to level up before we do this.
[288:33.83]I can't believe this is Elder Beast.
[288:35.95]Can I have some runes?
[288:38.69]Can you have some runes?
[288:40.17]I need like 1,200.
[288:41.03]Well, how many levels higher than me are you?
[288:47.30]I'll be right back.
[288:50.80]Because I feel like I keep loaning your runes and you're like 700 levels higher than me.
[289:04.66]I got a new staff.
[289:05.40]You want to look at it?
[289:08.52]What staff?
[289:09.20]I probably don't need it.
[289:10.14]I have the staff I want, just not the magic I want.
[289:14.90]Okay, that's enough.
[289:25.73]What is that thing?
[289:26.63]When did I get this?
[289:28.21]Wait, this thing gives strength, doesn't it?
[289:31.09]No, it gives dex.
[289:35.05]Bunch of poise.
[289:35.71]I should probably just put it on.
[289:44.84]Why not?
[289:45.20]It'd be more damage, right?
[289:49.54]This scales a little bit off dex.
[289:50.74]Alright.
[289:51.76]You ready?
[289:53.40]Alright.
[289:55.90]Oh my god, I didn't even upgrade!
[290:03.32]Now I am officially ready to go.
[290:05.00]Let's go.
[290:09.04]What's it gonna be?
[290:10.93]It's gonna be... It's... A...
[290:27.57]um what the what the hell happened holy um good luck we're this we're not doing this I don't think we're gonna beat this one I think we're not beating this one
[290:54.09]We gotta break the thing on his ankle.
[290:56.13]Where is it?
[290:57.91]Which ankle is it?
[291:03.16]Which leg?
[291:03.62]I can't even... What leg is it on?
[291:08.58]It's on his left leg.
[291:09.50]Is he wearing a turmeric bracelet?
[291:12.92]Yeah, we gotta get the turmeric bracelet that's on his left leg.
[291:16.97]Okay, well it's probably on the leg that has a lower half.
[291:22.03]Good luck, man.
[291:24.63]We actually did a good amount of damage.
[291:29.67]Yeah, gonna break the bracelet on his left leg.
[291:31.47]The second phase is gonna be horrible here.
[291:33.47]Uh-oh.
[291:52.32]What the fuck?
[291:53.34]I don't know, dude.
[291:54.04]Where did that fire come from?
[291:58.55]This is phase two.
[292:00.25]It is.
[292:00.73]You're right.
[292:01.29]That is.
[292:02.61]What?
[292:05.97]That's right.
[292:06.59]The bracelet's already broken.
[292:13.52]What?
[292:15.69]Oh, he summoned the slow moving things and they like finally caught up to me and it comboed me.
[292:21.17]We're going to be here for a little while.
[292:24.52]Yeah, I walked in and I saw him shooting in the air.
[292:27.38]That's weird because he doesn't do that until phase two.
[292:31.32]He had a great entrance though.
[292:34.16]Probably best entrance of the whole time we've been playing.
[292:36.67]Yeah, I don't think this is going to be hard as long as we're not being like sabotaged by like someone telling me to like fight the ankle.
[292:43.79]and like can't find out which leg and he literally only has one leg but I but I thought it was very I don't know that you fight the ankle on phase one I'm just saying there's a couple of things with your story that are not lining up okay wait I'm gonna put on some like fire resistance or something oh yeah let's cheese it and like be prepared for the fight like losers
[293:08.17]Yeah.
[293:10.49]Let's prepare for this fight.
[293:13.35]You fucking dweeb.
[293:15.20]Get in here.
[293:16.56]I'm putting gear on.
[293:17.94]I usually get my fire resistance.
[293:21.40]Hurry up.
[293:22.28]Magma giant.
[293:23.06]Just get on the horses.
[293:23.92]Skip the whole game.
[293:25.56]Missed seven bosses in ten areas.
[293:28.12]Hurry up and don't put any fire resistance gear on.
[293:30.54]I'm coming.
[293:36.95]That's the same damage if you dodge it.
[293:46.56]Alright, attack the hands.
[293:54.69]OK, that was dumb.
[294:17.87]Jesus!
[294:19.35]How did I not get hit by that?
[294:20.59]I have no idea.
[294:27.22]Why does he move his hand?
[294:30.40]That is really annoying.
[294:48.12]What the fuck?
[294:51.32]He is really actually is.
[294:59.52]Stop every time I go for the hand.
[295:01.28]I just he just instant moves it.
[295:17.13]We're doing pretty good.
[295:20.08]staggered really?
[295:25.80]Is there a place to hit him anywhere?
[295:29.27]His hands.
[295:30.87]I mean like a. Oh.
[295:41.46]But I don't think he has a stab point.
[295:47.84]Not this bullshit again.
[295:52.29]Oh my god!
[296:05.28]What?
[296:06.34]Oh.
[296:20.86]Stop moving.
[296:22.28]Oh my God.
[296:23.05]I feel like I just crushed like a bug.
[296:28.21]He's going sicko mode on you.
[296:30.09]Yeah, he is.
[296:37.04]I don't know why I'm casting this magic.
[296:38.48]It's too powerful.
[296:44.01]Uh-oh.
[296:44.19]Make it rain.
[296:49.45]Why is that?
[296:50.75]That's like, why is that up there?
[296:53.07]Why is, make it rain, make it rain.
[296:55.49]Why is it up there?
[296:56.67]I don't know why it's up there in your head.
[296:59.65]Why not?
[297:01.70]Oh, now you just made me laugh, and now I'm having problems.
[297:05.82]I was dodging every attack.
[297:07.42]Everything was going so smoothly.
[297:15.75]Make it rain.
[297:25.48]Make it rain.
[297:36.22]When was the last time you even played that game?
[297:38.58]Seriously.
[297:42.18]I don't know.
[297:42.74]Years and years.
[297:45.97]I actually played like once a year ago, maybe with like Moon was playing.
[297:53.46]It's still like a pretty fun game.
[297:56.50]It is, yeah, I'm surprised they still get like a whole bunch of content.
[298:03.42]Nice job.
[298:04.30]A lot of my chat I don't think got it.
[298:06.34]It's a quote from smite.
[298:09.02]When one of the characters who shoots fireballs is make it rain.
[298:13.62]Yeah, it's Agni.
[298:15.82]Agni has this move.
[298:17.82]Only in one of his skins.
[298:19.16]But Jerma, I am aware that Jerma loves it.
[298:22.40]I mean, it's just... I have not heard that in a very long time.
[298:26.62]I got a Sacred Tear.
[298:29.14]I totally spaced out and I was thinking about Swagni.
[298:32.20]I think I got one too.
[298:33.06]I don't even know.
[298:34.82]Oh, the doubters lost out big time, I think, here.
[298:40.44]Sorry, doubters.
[298:41.50]You lost a lot.
[298:44.29]My personal recommendation is to be a believer from this point forward.
[298:50.19]Yeah, I would say so too.
[298:51.67]Do I have enough to level up again?
[298:59.10]More strength?
[299:00.46]Really?
[299:02.48]Nope.
[299:08.47]Oh, hold on.
[299:09.27]It's 26, I think.
[299:14.38]You know, you see the runes needed number all the time, but the second that it goes away, it's gone from your memory.
[299:19.97]Has that happened to you too?
[299:22.85]I haven't, I honestly have been like forgetting to level constantly.
[299:27.17]So I really haven't been looking at that.
[299:31.29]However, I can relate in programming.
[299:33.75]I constantly open up something and I'm like, oh yeah, I need to do that.
[299:37.65]And I'll close a window and be like, wait, what was I doing?
[299:53.21]No object permanence.
[299:55.69]You know, I do envy people that have really, really good object permanence.
[300:01.60]How do you have good... What's the scale?
[300:06.80]Okay, let me paint a picture for you.
[300:09.86]If you, you know, go somewhere.
[300:12.00]You take your car.
[300:13.48]You go somewhere.
[300:13.96]I'm going to go to the store.
[300:15.76]You lost me.
[300:16.56]You actually lost me already.
[300:17.82]Alright, but just for anybody that's listening.
[300:20.32]Don't have a license.
[300:21.38]I can't relate.
[300:22.82]okay so then just you just can hang out I always no matter what doesn't matter where I go where I park I always don't know the exact location of my car every time even when I say I look at the parking space I go this is where I am I got to remember this
[300:43.45]An hour goes by, two hours go by, and then it's just, I know the general vicinity of where the car is, but I don't have any idea where it is.
[300:52.05]That's not object permanence.
[300:53.51]Yes, it is.
[300:54.01]That's literally ADHD.
[300:57.61]That's object permanence.
[300:58.59]That's you keeping a thing in your brain and knowing where it is.
[301:02.51]That's object permanence.
[301:04.64]How is that not object permanence?
[301:05.74]It's the same thing.
[301:07.16]That's memory.
[301:07.82]What do you mean?
[301:09.56]Object permanence is like forgetting something exists when it's outside of your view.
[301:19.11]I don't do that.
[301:19.97]I just forget where it is.
[301:22.55]I know it exists.
[301:23.41]I just don't know where.
[301:27.06]Like, okay, this big stone.
[301:28.98]Okay, so I guess you're like a five on the scale.
[301:31.82]Five out of ten.
[301:32.56]Yeah, it's not that bad.
[301:35.08]And a one is like a toddler.
[301:38.11]And you're like four points away from that.
[301:40.45]Object permanence would be... Hold on, somebody said something.
[301:42.29]I want to read it.
[301:44.27]You have a bad memory.
[301:45.47]Yeah, so what... Object permanence is how peekaboo works with babies.
[301:53.18]Wait a minute.
[301:53.60]Yeah, that is.
[301:55.28]Object permanence would be if you forgot your car existed.
[302:00.01]That's what I said.
[302:00.77]I know.
[302:00.97]Why are you laughing at what he says?
[302:02.69]Because he said it first and I saw it and I caught it.
[302:04.77]It was in my mind.
[302:05.62]A little bit of object permanence problem there.
[302:07.76]But I did see it and I forgot it for a second.
[302:10.42]Then you said it.
[302:12.06]You absolutely tuned me out.
[302:13.78]Can I turn my mic up?
[302:14.66]Is there a problem?
[302:15.56]You said I was quiet the other day.
[302:16.70]Are you there?
[302:17.62]Hello?
[302:20.92]It's poor awareness.
[302:22.64]Whatever it is.
[302:23.42]It's what I have.
[302:24.60]It's awareness.
[302:27.51]It's- it's aw- it's awareness, it's memory, object memory awareness.
[302:33.20]Is that better?
[302:33.71]Give a shit memory.
[302:37.03]Yeah.
[302:42.38]I lose my keys all the time my wallet memory yes it is no no how is losing your keys not memory it's not memory this is a symptom of adult adhd where if you put something down you forget where it is not because your memory what is what is forgetting about something else because your attention is on something else you're not forgetting because you never have the memory of putting it somewhere
[303:05.65]Because you're not focused on that.
[303:06.87]You're focused on something else.
[303:07.85]But that's memory.
[303:09.83]You're talking about a piece of your memory.
[303:11.81]Short-term memory is memory.
[303:13.84]Short-term memory.
[303:15.02]Don't let him cook.
[303:16.50]No, let me eat!
[303:17.44]Okay.
[303:19.02]I'm done cooking.
[303:21.58]Okay.
[303:22.82]I believe we just... I think we did it.
[303:30.10]We did it?
[303:30.68]Yeah, I think we can go fight Radon.
[303:32.00]I'm fairly certain we can go.
[303:36.91]I think.
[303:39.45]And I'm really, really praying that Radon is like a normal soldier in a, in a big empty desert.
[303:58.66]I think your dementia is contagious.
[304:07.62]I voted to teleport.
[304:08.48]Was something going on?
[304:09.69]I did too.
[304:11.81]Did we pick the wrong one?
[304:13.25]I don't think so.
[304:15.75]Bread Maiden Castle Plaza.
[304:16.95]Yeah, that's the one.
[304:19.36]Sometimes it's just a little weird.
[304:22.94]It can be a little weird.
[304:37.93]Shermer has to buy a new car every time he leaves the house.
[304:42.67]Well, I never had a car before.
[304:44.24]I guess I have to get one.
[304:47.16]I've got to drive.
[304:49.18]Oh, you hear the Halo music?
[304:58.88]Before we begin, did you cut him off?
[305:02.86]I'm in the cut scene.
[305:05.96]Yeah, I am too.
[305:06.70]Are we skipping?
[305:09.03]Yeah, I want to watch his horse.
[305:28.35]die you want to watch this horse die no I we've I've seen this cutscene a lot okay it's kind of like up I don't want to fight him yet because I have a lot of uh I need to level up we're gonna win we're gonna first try dude no coward coward coward first try coward first try coward there's a lot to lose
[305:47.42]First try.
[305:47.84]Coward.
[305:48.60]You'll pick it back up when we go in again if we die.
[305:50.34]But we're going to first try it.
[305:51.66]You agreed when I said no more doubters.
[305:54.14]Object permanence Andy.
[305:55.26]You should believe now.
[305:57.50]Short term memory Andy.
[305:58.58]Come on!
[305:58.94]Come on!
[305:59.56]Come on!
[306:02.18]It's a lot to lose there, man.
[306:09.93]I thought I was going to be alive.
[306:11.37]I really did.
[306:12.95]I thought it was going to be like 2 HP.
[306:26.50]Can I- I need to get my- I need to get those back.
[306:33.86]Dude, you got this wrong.
[306:34.92]Object permanence would be forgetting the ground exists.
[306:40.53]How extreme are we going?
[306:42.65]Okay, that's very extreme.
[306:44.19]I forgot that I am an object and that actually I am inhabiting this body on Earth.
[306:49.86]I thought I was on the astral plane.
[306:51.74]I dreamed that I was a butterfly.
[306:53.54]I feel like there's levels, there's tiers of this.
[306:56.22]It's not just like, oh, object permanence issue.
[307:00.26]That means you must not understand that you're holding a sword.
[307:03.80]You let it go and then you picked it up and it's the first time you've ever seen it.
[307:09.57]that's uh that's augren's will they beat we're down first try I don't know this is a good this is tough because we who know it could be it could be something really annoying this is the first try this is the first triangle I we're not I'm not losing this I'm committed to not losing this and I'm 100 sure this is going to be like a crab and what is it star it's Godrick
[307:33.80]uh phase two Godrick or we're gonna summon everybody we have to see that we have to see what that we know we do I want to see what their outfits are they're all gonna have funny outfits that's that's true the voters didn't know we were summoning all the guys this guy's got rivers of blood just let them fight don't even play the game just summon everybody because there's no there's no way they're gonna die
[308:02.10]If you bet against this, yeah, true.
[308:03.70]Actually, if you bet against this, you are just trying to lose your money.
[308:06.56]Just trying to lose your points.
[308:09.86]Now, here's the real question.
[308:10.70]Where is Godrick?
[308:12.04]Are they just hanging out somewhere?
[308:13.50]He's going to be up on the hill.
[308:14.78]What does Blade have for, like, stuff?
[308:18.00]He looks the same.
[308:19.00]Does he?
[308:19.26]Yeah.
[308:23.24]Yeah, he might be, like... What are you doing, dude?
[308:24.96]We got to walk up there with the boys.
[308:28.40]Oh shit, he's running.
[308:29.34]Let's go.
[308:29.92]Oh shit, he is running.
[308:31.46]Wait, what the fuck?
[308:35.58]Oh, for some reason I was thinking of a different boss.
[308:38.97]Alright, let's see how they do.
[308:44.45]Wait, there's more people to summon up there.
[308:45.93]There's a... Is this... I know there's like a healer, right?
[308:50.55]Yep.
[308:53.64]Maiden.
[308:55.06]Maiden.
[308:58.18]Alright, let's see how they do.
[309:08.12]Somebody died already.
[309:09.14]Dude, if you guys can't beat Godrick, I don't know how you ever thought you're going to be at Radon.
[309:24.24]Where's Sigward?
[309:28.69]This is a major let your ambitions to rest moment.
[309:39.48]No, you should have waited.
[309:44.42]They're dying, dude.
[309:45.32]Yeah, they're not doing that great.
[309:47.18]The healers on the look at the healer behind us.
[309:49.92]They're stuck.
[309:53.62]Oh, no.
[309:54.06]Is she stuck?
[309:55.69]Yeah, she was stuck inside all the rubble.
[309:57.63]Come on, Gwen.
[309:58.09]Get in there.
[310:07.59]She's kind of smart.
[310:11.37]She's waiting for the real gamers to get in there before she buffs us.
[310:16.35]She's going to be throwing lightning spears.
[310:17.77]Uh-oh.
[310:18.71]Wait, where's Blade going?
[310:22.89]Wait, where is he going?
[310:25.89]Wait, is he... Why is he running over here?
[310:30.04]He's just floating in the sky on my screen.
[310:31.56]I think he died.
[310:32.08]Alright, let's get him.
[310:40.53]Oh, you gotta run away from this shit.
[310:41.95]I forgot about that.
[310:45.31]I'm only doing comedy spell.
[310:48.77]But I need you to hold him in place.
[310:51.77]You got him.
[310:52.37]Thank you.
[310:53.83]God damn it.
[311:04.72]When does he go?
[311:05.88]Giving the doubters some hope.
[311:09.84]I like the part where he goes... Scream, scream.
[311:22.15]Yep.
[311:23.55]Are we going to actually... Does he do... Will he do phase two?
[311:26.17]I wonder.
[311:26.73]No.
[311:27.13]No.
[311:27.57]God, have you been paying attention?
[311:29.08]But he does phase two in half health, not at the end of the health bar.
[311:32.90]He's going to be a different boss, right?
[311:34.50]Like Rinaldo was.
[311:35.28]Wait, he is going to be a different boss.
[311:37.04]Oh, crap.
[311:40.01]Oh, how's your comedy looking now?
[311:44.61]Even at half health.
[311:46.37]Like it's not him leaving, it's just him doing a cut scene.
[311:50.95]Here it is.
[311:51.91]Oh, he's actually.
[311:52.45]Oh, he does do it.
[311:53.57]Have you been paying attention?
[311:55.08]Don't make fun of me when you're the dope.
[312:03.28]See, he hasn't been paying attention.
[312:08.70]Alright, let's summon all of our friends again.
[312:13.40]Or is that cheating?
[312:14.22]I don't know.
[312:18.24]It's at least like... Just get healed at least.
[312:21.96]I don't know.
[312:22.42]I feel like we should fight the character.
[312:26.94]Alright, fine.
[312:30.61]Too bad we don't have the music.
[312:31.85]The object music is the best in the game.
[312:43.44]No, don't kill our healer.
[312:45.87]What did she throw?
[312:46.53]Whoa!
[313:09.38]Finish him off.
[313:17.98]Oh, he killed me with it.
[313:21.91]I thought he was aiming at you.
[313:25.29]I actually thought he was aiming at you.
[313:27.69]Oh, shit.
[313:28.16]We're going to lose.
[313:42.31]Here comes the throw from the Ster.
[313:59.98]My game is freezing.
[314:01.80]You are jumping around.
[314:03.00]Just a couple more hits and you got it.
[314:10.60]I rolled backwards like a dope.
[314:13.44]OK.
[314:21.39]Hey, I got the wait.
[314:22.43]I have the right side of the Howling Tree Medallion.
[314:25.27]Do you have the left side?
[314:27.23]Yes, I believe so.
[314:29.01]OK, we have that.
[314:31.25]I again got three golden seeds.
[314:33.93]Geez.
[314:35.59]All the bosses are just spitting seeds out at me.
[314:38.35]I don't know why.
[314:38.97]That's pretty weird.
[314:41.85]Can you go over the cap in a randomizer or no?
[314:43.71]Is it just going to give you the amount that exists in the game?
[314:46.88]Shouldn't really be that amount.
[314:49.40]Can you sit at the bonfire?
[314:51.88]I'm watching the cutscene.
[314:53.20]Okay, sorry.
[314:53.68]You're not watching the cutscene.
[314:54.66]You're just waiting.
[314:55.34]I understand.
[314:57.86]Okay, I am Elden ringing.
[314:59.62]Loading screen.
[315:00.58]I'm loading.
[315:01.12]It probably looks like I'm hitting a vape over here.
[315:09.68]I keep going like...
[315:14.23]it's a fucking drink container oh some hot cider my game is in an infinite loading screen I think okay no it actually loads it's this I I fill it up I was just worried that it might have like crashed because this is when it like changes the world state because you killed radon there's a bonfire out here right
[315:45.96]It's supposed to be.
[315:48.52]There's something we might actually... Hold on.
[315:54.50]Does Radon have to die for the game to register that?
[315:58.94]No, the cutscene, everything happened for no chrome.
[316:01.30]Everything did happen, okay.
[316:03.90]Because you said you were in the cutscene, but... Where is the bonfire, then?
[316:09.72]It should be right here.
[316:10.54]There's a catacombs down here.
[316:12.22]I'll get that waypoint.
[316:27.23]You spectating?
[316:29.07]I'm reading a comment.
[316:29.94]I heard you said that you believe aliens built Walmart.
[316:35.22]I feel like that's something I probably said, so I don't know.
[316:38.26]Yeah, I think that I guess.
[316:41.84]No, I definitely did I. I think that Miyazaki, no, not Miyazaki.
[316:51.37]He's the guy who made Death Stranding.
[316:55.52]For a second, I thought you were going to say that you said Miyazaki made Walmart.
[317:00.14]No, no, no.
[317:00.62]It's weirder.
[317:01.38]Many actually said it.
[317:02.83]Who?
[317:03.31]Kojima.
[317:03.87]Kojima said that aliens did 9-11.
[317:06.97]Oh.
[317:08.89]Where are you?
[317:09.73]Oh, that's right.
[317:10.47]I forgot about this cave.
[317:14.31]This looks weird.
[317:17.27]My game is very unhappy.
[317:18.49]I would be surprised if I didn't crash in like five seconds.
[317:25.79]I think this, when I rest, it'll kill you.
[317:27.93]It'll murder you.
[317:29.77]And then you're going to have to go back out into the desert and get your souls from there.
[317:33.75]Bitch.
[317:39.89]DLC leak.
[317:40.99]Oh, we're seeing underneath Ironforge duties.
[317:43.31]Wait, there is a... There's a bonfire out here.
[317:48.12]Yeah.
[317:49.84]Yeah, I couldn't see anything you were doing.
[317:52.30]Oh, I ran to the... What?
[317:56.81]You know?
[317:57.59]I kind of need to crush your head.
[318:00.49]My what?
[318:05.63]You are poking out of the ground.
[318:07.33]Just the top of your head is.
[318:08.25]Okay, I need to go over here.
[318:27.40]Uh, can you even agree to that?
[318:28.82]I can.
[318:34.70]You probably have to do it again, though.
[318:37.22]Well, I'm saying because it's like a bonfire you don't have.
[318:41.53]I guess it's there.
[318:42.77]I can see it.
[318:44.35]I think is you're the host.
[318:45.49]This is technically your game, so anything you do I get as well.
[318:49.53]Failed.
[318:49.95]Yeah, it does it sometimes.
[318:53.35]Ster it again.
[318:54.77]What's your favorite mobile game?
[318:57.60]right now um pine tar poker lame that's say it but play it and then tell me say it play it and then tell me say it play and then tell me pine tar poker play it and tell me I would love to hear you I'd love to hear you say that again after you play it okay okay
[319:29.90]Do you like Yahtzee?
[319:34.12]I've never played Yahtzee.
[319:35.62]Oh, that's another thing he skipped.
[319:37.00]Oh my God, dude.
[319:37.76]You never played Yahtzee in Elden Ring?
[319:44.33]Wait, is this like random?
[319:45.35]Yeah, this is like random enemy battleground.
[319:47.39]Oh, they keep spawning, right?
[319:49.95]At least they should keep spawning.
[319:55.98]Alright, I just got to pay attention to what the hell's going on here.
[319:58.40]What is that?
[319:58.88]Is there a giant in here?
[320:00.11]Yes, I heard the attack on Titan.
[320:04.21]Yeah, he's down there.
[320:05.51]Okay, well, let's just go to the boss.
[320:12.76]There's a lot of shit here.
[320:13.92]This is a big place, if I remember.
[320:15.66]Oh, yeah.
[320:15.88]It's locked by some contraption.
[320:17.92]Yeah, we got to go up and jump through a window and out the window.
[320:21.04]Yeah, there's a lot.
[320:21.72]This is a wacky one.
[320:23.17]This one actually kind of sucks.
[320:24.51]It's one of the harder ones.
[320:25.81]I didn't spend my 87,000 souls.
[320:28.31]Yeah, neither did I. We're going back.
[320:31.27]Oh, shit.
[320:32.01]This poor flower doesn't stand a chance.
[320:35.21]No.
[320:36.61]I'm just going back to the beginning.
[320:54.45]Okay.
[320:55.34]You're going to feel the cold steel of my katana.
[320:59.56]Damn, that's a lot.
[321:01.88]When does the hard cap, the soft cap is for attributes?
[321:06.56]I believe it's 40.
[321:07.46]Is it 40 for strength, dex, intelligence?
[321:09.64]40, right?
[321:10.20]Either 40 or 50.
[321:13.11]It's 60.
[321:16.79]Oh, 40, 60, 80.
[321:17.63]Okay, yeah.
[321:18.57]It keeps diminishing, right?
[321:28.98]How's everybody doing?
[321:29.50]Good?
[321:30.10]How you guys doing?
[321:31.26]How you doing?
[321:31.88]Everyone doing okay?
[321:32.66]Everyone good on water?
[321:34.02]Anyone need any, uh... Anyone need anything?
[321:37.19]That did sound like that, didn't it?
[321:39.33]Like I was the host of a party.
[321:41.29]Everybody good?
[321:41.99]You guys good?
[321:42.35]You need anything?
[321:43.43]Breadsticks?
[321:44.21]We're gonna get you.
[321:44.81]You guys good?
[321:50.66]How come all the shitty enemies are in the path we have to go and they're like not fighting each other?
[321:56.62]Um, that's a good question.
[322:01.44]This guy is very confused.
[322:04.49]Ooh.
[322:05.71]That still did a ton of health damage to me.
[322:09.45]Are you like a parry guy?
[322:10.65]Do you like it?
[322:11.19]Do you like parrying?
[322:13.09]I like parrying a lot in any game.
[322:16.07]What game has the best parry?
[322:18.22]This is a great Ster question, I think.
[322:20.48]Soul Calibur.
[322:24.94]That was such an unbelievable statement.
[322:27.14]I'm so confused by it that I died.
[322:30.48]What do you mean?
[322:32.84]What game has the best parries?
[322:34.54]Soul Calibur has a lot of fucking awesome parries.
[322:37.04]But that sounds so interesting to me.
[322:38.86]I needed to explain it a little bit in more detail.
[322:41.78]It's always been one of the main mechanics of Soul Calibur is if you press any character, you can press...
[322:47.13]garden down or garden up and you have to do the correct parry for if it's a low mid or high or like there's characters with special parries that have like if you parry it then you like instantly go into another move and it's uh it's like a whole you know just built-in system and it's very nice because it's you're like shield lights up so you know the timing for it very well and it makes a nice like and when you get it you feel good that sounds actually really fun
[323:11.31]Alright, but what about not multiplayer?
[323:14.08]Just like a PvE scenario.
[323:16.70]What game has the best PvE parry?
[323:19.88]Soul Calibur 2 in the Labyrinth mode.
[323:24.27]Alright.
[323:28.49]I would struggle to even think of...
[323:33.98]games besides like Dark Souls well which FromSoftware game has the best parry then trying to remember how it even worked in Bloodborne because you didn't have parries you had like used your gun to parry I feel like Dark Souls one had a really just satisfying parry
[323:58.81]gonna be wrong though I really do like just the general Dark Souls using the small little buckler yeah and you do this thing you go you go like this yeah and when you do it you go you make like a noise and it gets into like noise of the year like that right yeah I love that Sekiro is uh Sekiro is a rhythm game
[324:28.85]like playing uh have you not have you not played soul caliber you and I played it I think in the same room at one point just like sitting around hanging out oh yeah we did it like a pax east when they were like showing a soul caliber four yeah I I'm not I really don't play fighting games I'm really not into them I just I mean some of the ones like
[324:52.60]I like, like, Smash.
[324:54.30]Like, I've played it a bunch.
[324:55.54]Multiversus is fun.
[324:56.66]The kind of, like, 2D plane fighting games where both characters are like this and they, like, are fighting this way.
[325:05.67]Well, actually, that's Multiversus and Smash.
[325:07.83]You know what I mean?
[325:08.27]It's, like, zoomed in.
[325:09.85]You know what I'm saying?
[325:10.97]It's like the 1v1 just zoomed in camera.
[325:13.95]Yeah.
[325:15.12]I don't really like to play those.
[325:16.78]I'm not very good at them.
[325:22.75]I like how those statements went together.
[325:25.73]I don't like non-platform fighting games.
[325:30.19]I feel like you need a lot of knowledge to play them well, and I just don't really have the time or want to give the time to it.
[325:35.48]Do you know where the mechanism is?
[325:41.54]I know where it is.
[325:44.36]I have never actually fought one of these enemies.
[325:46.20]I just avoid them.
[325:51.06]Oh, that's curse and I'm dead.
[325:54.69]I forgot they had the curse.
[325:56.29]I forgot.
[325:57.33]Can you res me?
[325:57.83]Yeah, I'm going to res you.
[326:05.46]Street Fighter is six.
[326:06.72]It's on cooldown.
[326:08.60]Another 20 minutes.
[326:09.66]Do you like Street Fighter?
[326:10.70]Do you like to play Street Fighter at all?
[326:13.04]I'm interested in the new one, and I'm always interested in them, but I've never really played them a lot.
[326:17.73]I have to reset this.
[326:18.51]I was going to say, I mean, like, Evo moment number... I think that shit's cool.
[326:24.65]I like parries the most in fighting games, so when you're excluding all multiplayer games, you're kind of like, oh, you respawned this motherfucker right on top of me.
[326:35.22]He's easy.
[326:35.98]Geez.
[326:36.72]I'm really upset.
[326:37.56]You are just sabotaging my game.
[326:41.28]Alright, Vince McMahon.
[326:45.25]That really was the Vince McMahon.
[326:50.73]Okay, I got it.
[326:51.61]It was like right there.
[326:55.17]So when you... Where the fuck am I going?
[327:00.82]I'm going back to the bonfire.
[327:02.28]Let's both meet over the bonfire.
[327:03.76]Then we can just walk to the boss.
[327:04.82]Okay.
[327:07.73]Guilty Gear is fun too.
[327:10.25]I like fighting games.
[327:14.66]What's the best Soul Calibur?
[327:15.66]You're really going to ask that?
[327:23.86]You're really going to put me there in that spot?
[327:28.05]It has to be two.
[327:29.27]I found a weapon that you probably are going to like.
[327:33.90]I found the carrion night sword.
[327:35.12]It's like just a great, uh, intelligence weapon.
[327:40.20]Uh, wait, what was it?
[327:41.22]Carrion night sword.
[327:43.04]Oh yeah.
[327:44.04]Uh, sure.
[327:44.80]I want it.
[327:45.30]I was going to buy it earlier.
[327:46.70]It was in my, uh, dragon heart shop.
[327:48.93]Oh, okay.
[327:49.83]Oh yeah.
[327:50.07]Don't die.
[327:50.43]You're, you're scarlet rod.
[327:51.29]You know, you're, you're a little stinky.
[327:53.83]It's a soul caliber too.
[327:56.15]Yeah.
[327:57.62]mean I liked the newer ones a lot but there's a lot of things objectively in them that I would feel like a bad person saying they were the best six the most recent one is actually also I would I would put like two and six are both top for different reasons really so the newer one is good yeah it just I don't know a weird amount of support where it gets overshadowed by tekken
[328:23.54]Soul Calibur is slower, right?
[328:25.41]It's not like a... It's like a... It's a lot slower.
[328:31.87]Okay.
[328:32.55]I probably would like it if I really ever... How is it compared to like Mortal Kombat?
[328:36.71]Because Mortal Kombat is not fast, but it's not really slow either.
[328:40.80]I'd say generally it's probably even slower than Mortal Kombat because a lot of the 2D fighters like that, like your punch in Mortal Kombat or in like Street Fighter, a punch is like a three frame attack where just like...
[328:52.92]it's happening it's going to be that he punches but every like the slowest moves in the fastest moves excuse me in slow caliber are 11 to like 15 frame range because I I was marv versus capcom is like um what is that
[329:15.26]Anyways, um... The problem that I always have with fighting games is... Especially something like... Like Marvel vs. Capcom, for instance.
[329:23.05]It's just... It's almost... I can't really even... This is actually gonna be probably horrible.
[329:28.39]Yeah.
[329:31.97]Depends on how much... Uh... Yeah.
[329:34.73]Yeah.
[329:35.11]Dude, you're... You're fucking dead, dude.
[329:36.90]Um...
[329:38.61]We can skip this one.
[329:39.63]We don't have to do this one.
[329:40.63]No, we're doing this one.
[329:41.71]I need to learn how this boss actually works.
[329:43.97]There is nothing to learn.
[329:44.87]It literally just spams every ability it has.
[329:47.55]Do you have heals?
[329:49.32]Because heals actually do a ton of damage to this.
[329:53.16]No.
[329:54.42]This is one of those enemies that I feel like they programmed a bunch of extra moves and they forgot to take them out.
[330:03.89]Like, this character's moveset has like five extra swings that they just didn't delete from the lines of code.
[330:13.84]This is, yeah, like a Sekiro enemy.
[330:15.56]You're just supposed to like auto parry everything.
[330:22.52]I might be able to do it because I have faith, yeah.
[330:25.44]Can he be parried?
[330:27.58]I doubt it.
[330:29.32]Who knows?
[330:29.96]Maybe.
[330:30.26]The timings are also so weird.
[330:36.06]And it screeches at you like a fucking child.
[330:39.50]Everything about it.
[330:41.63]Just like the weird pig scream.
[330:43.13]That like... I could probably do it if I really tried.
[330:49.25]It's like a... But... It's... You're in O shape with your mouth.
[330:54.46]It's... I could do it if I really wanted to.
[330:57.36]But I feel like I don't want to wake a bunch of people up like last time.
[331:00.76]I think you're good, dude.
[331:02.52]You're really trying to farm the worst sound today.
[331:04.77]I'm not even.
[331:06.39]Worst sound of the year.
[331:07.19]Every clip's going to be from this stream.
[331:09.57]Well, dude, I played Elden Ring for two months straight at the beginning of last year.
[331:13.67]Like, 30 clips were nominated for stuff.
[331:17.27]So, come on.
[331:17.80]We've been playing it a lot.
[331:24.66]Hold on.
[331:24.90]Let me actually... Hold on.
[331:29.24]How much faith do I have?
[331:30.03]Because I wonder if that heal really is something I should put on right now.
[331:34.37]Give me a second.
[331:46.64]You're saying something about Marvel or something?
[331:49.46]Oh, right, right.
[331:49.94]We got jumped by an evil boss?
[331:52.68]What is the Great Heal?
[331:54.48]How much faith is the Great Heal?
[331:56.20]I might ask it back, actually.
[331:58.22]Wait, I don't have one of the catalysts.
[331:59.71]I have no idea because my game says zero.
[332:02.03]I don't have a catalyst.
[332:02.93]I can't cast this spell.
[332:04.13]Can I?
[332:05.61]I could give you one.
[332:08.17]I think this actually makes these enemies just completely trivial if you just cast seals at them.
[332:14.64]I have a dragon seal.
[332:15.96]Do I?
[332:19.31]It's like warming stone.
[332:20.97]I've never done this.
[332:23.25]Oh, no.
[332:24.29]I did get a dragon seal.
[332:25.39]Okay.
[332:27.74]Okay.
[332:28.26]So, let me drop a great heal.
[332:32.52]Because I might be able to... Just teleport.
[332:37.76]Just teleport back here.
[332:39.14]I'm at the boss door.
[332:40.00]Why don't you just come here?
[332:40.78]Because a great heal might be able to kill this guy in like five hits.
[332:45.53]Okay, so why don't you come here and get it?
[332:47.17]Because I have to attune it.
[332:48.63]I'm walking back.
[332:50.41]No, no, no, no.
[332:51.23]Let's just... We're fine.
[332:53.75]Okay, I want to hear that Marvel thought.
[332:56.79]Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is so fast that it's almost hard for me to even pay attention to what's happening.
[333:03.01]And I feel like the, you know what I'm not a big fan of at the Soul Calibur?
[333:06.63]I don't think Soul Calibur has this.
[333:08.37]I'm not a big fan of the zoom the camera in to show, like, here we go, something's happening.
[333:14.75]I want to just see what's going on.
[333:16.83]Like the, here comes the move, and we go zoom in really close and then zoom out.
[333:20.72]I want to see the whole plan.
[333:24.26]I mean, it zooms in when you guys stand closer to each other, if that's what you're talking about.
[333:29.83]How close do I have to be for this?
[333:38.26]What?
[333:38.58]That fucking doesn't even work.
[333:44.54]He fucking comboed me, man.
[333:47.66]Does this not work?
[333:48.60]Urgent heal is not an AOE.
[333:50.30]Okay.
[333:51.66]Oh, do you mean supers in Marvel?
[333:53.89]Yes.
[333:54.15]Where you go into super and it changes the whole screen?
[333:57.69]Yeah, it's like... And the camera goes close up to their face or they're doing something.
[334:02.63]Sometimes it doesn't hold another scene off camera.
[334:06.19]I actually also hate those.
[334:07.35]The new Soul Calibur does it and I hate them.
[334:11.14]I wouldn't say I hate it.
[334:14.92]It's unnecessary to me.
[334:16.76]I agree.
[334:17.46]I would rather it be an in-game attack rather than a cinematic.
[334:23.40]Drop a great heal on the ground so I can equip it later when we die in literally 10 seconds.
[334:29.01]Uh-oh.
[334:35.95]He's gone.
[334:37.31]I'm not... What?
[334:40.20]Am I not dropping it?
[334:41.56]On my screen, you were running in place.
[334:48.37]So will this... Let me see.
[334:54.47]No, it's a... Oh, okay.
[334:55.55]Yeah.
[334:55.85]No, no, no.
[334:56.19]I'm going back.
[334:56.87]This should do it.
[334:58.55]Why waste time?
[334:59.55]I'll be right back.
[335:07.28]It is an AoE.
[335:14.76]The thing is, I like watching people play those games.
[335:18.12]I think it's cool.
[335:18.78]Because when people do the combos and you get... It looks like it takes a lot of interesting skill set to do.
[335:26.58]That I will never be able to have.
[335:29.30]And it's just fun to kind of watch people that know what they're doing play it.
[335:41.24]Get mana.
[335:41.62]Okay.
[335:43.16]I'm a big soul caliber enthusiast.
[335:48.52]There's barely any combos.
[335:51.28]I hate games where it's like 16 hit combo from corner to corner.
[335:55.89]But even that, I don't know.
[335:57.35]It's gotten worse with that over time as well.
[335:59.87]How close do I have to be to use this?
[336:01.25]Does it matter where I am?
[336:06.18]Holy shit.
[336:07.48]Jesus.
[336:08.04]Oh, my God.
[336:08.90]Oh, my God.
[336:09.42]That scared me.
[336:10.26]It was so ridiculous.
[336:12.12]You died.
[336:14.61]Okay.
[336:14.97]So that.
[336:15.27]Alright.
[336:15.81]So I don't have any more mana, but I will if we don't beat it.
[336:19.35]Oh, my God.
[336:33.88]Let me just drink for a second.
[336:35.31]Bring him in the circle.
[336:37.89]Dude.
[336:39.01]I feel like I'm playing a fighting game against somebody.
[336:41.17]I was doing comedy.
[336:42.55]I'm sorry.
[336:52.64]I'm so glad we can kill this guy in two seconds now.
[336:54.42]Okay.
[336:56.74]We're good.
[337:02.38]Pass that shit to me.
[337:05.34]You have faith, right?
[337:06.32]Yeah, but what do you mean pass that to you?
[337:08.38]You want to be the one that does it?
[337:11.04]Yo, pass that shit to me, dog.
[337:13.44]No, this is mine.
[337:14.48]I'm doing it.
[337:14.88]Alright, let's go.
[337:22.25]That's like the most compelling argument I've had to switch to faith and do the healing fire stuff I was talking about.
[337:27.85]Just to get rid of that enemy?
[337:29.19]Just delete that enemy from the whole game whenever you see it?
[337:31.50]Yep.
[337:33.28]Yeah.
[337:39.45]You're losing focus because of the mask?
[337:41.65]That's good to know.
[337:49.86]That sound was so loud too.
[337:51.22]It was like he got hit by a hundred damage abilities in a row.
[337:56.50]Not by one singular ability.
[338:04.67]I'll defend you, my lord.
[338:05.63]Alright, here we go.
[338:15.10]Drink.
[338:21.88]Wow.
[338:22.28]I never knew that either.
[338:23.24]That's silly.
[338:23.92]That's some silly shit.
[338:26.36]What's Amber drought?
[338:28.36]Drought?
[338:28.82]What is this?
[338:29.35]I've never seen that item.
[338:41.77]Oh, it's the puppet guy.
[338:45.35]Oh, can you give me that carrion knight sword?
[338:47.83]Did you?
[338:48.43]Yeah.
[338:49.40]Okay, I'm not of this reality.
[338:53.12]Okay, so you did mention, you said, hey man, I really want those spells.
[338:58.10]It's 15 faith to use great heal.
[339:00.00]Are you actually going to put like five points in faith?
[339:03.24]Yeah.
[339:04.32]Are you going to?
[339:05.60]Yeah.
[339:06.45]Okay.
[339:08.33]I have to take it off at the bonfire.
[339:22.69]like I from the beginning I just want it like carrying great sword or something that was a lot of souls but uh nobody's finding it do you want them both I'm imagining you probably do sure I'm gonna give you this other thing too it's just like frenzy it's a ton of faith you're probably never gonna use it but you're spell guy
[339:57.75]And it was Great Heal was the one that hit him?
[340:00.45]Great Heal is the AOE, yeah.
[340:04.47]Urgent Heal, I think, is just a... Heal's you.
[340:08.23]I think.
[340:08.45]Okay, where are we going?
[340:12.74]We killed Verdahn.
[340:13.36]I think the next logical place is... Plateau?
[340:22.84]There's not any major bosses that, like, is before Plateau?
[340:36.21]Are you getting runes?
[340:38.07]What about the great runes?
[340:39.39]The great runes are also random.
[340:43.35]Is that going to lock us out of being able to beat the game?
[340:47.07]potentially but the merchants do sell hints to like where some items are and if we really need to look there's like a spoiler file that'll tell you where great runes can be found but I think we could go tries to put them in places where you'll probably find them uh nakaron is apparently the next logical step so underground or do the plateau go through the capital
[341:16.54]Volcano Manor is another one, too.
[341:17.66]Yep.
[341:18.92]Up in the mountains.
[341:19.98]I feel like there's a lot of bosses up in the mountains, too.
[341:23.90]Do you want to do the skip to Volcano Manor from Cilia or wherever?
[341:32.26]You know what I mean?
[341:33.62]Oh, that enemy is going to be different.
[341:34.70]Never mind.
[341:34.98]We can't do it.
[341:35.41]It's up to you.
[341:40.67]I actually totally forget how you get to Volcano Manor without doing that.
[341:50.44]I wonder if there's... Is it... How do you get to Volcano Manor normally?
[342:00.05]You have to get the invitation, right?
[342:02.93]To, like, go actually inside of it?
[342:04.85]And do the... How do you get to... What's his name?
[342:09.30]The snake guy.
[342:11.24]Rikard.
[342:11.68]Rikard, yeah.
[342:13.34]You need the...
[342:15.12]like walk all the way up the mountain on uh it's a long travel on plateau plateau platy platypus from where you fought the Fire Giant yeah the mod kept in the volcano skip you can go without the wait it does someone said that
[342:42.81]I'm going to give you the quarterback seat here because I'll do anything.
[342:46.65]Just looking at the map thinking.
[342:50.29]If there's anything I'm forgetting.
[342:54.78]Let's just go to the plateau and.
[342:57.56]The NPC can TP you to Volcano Manor, really?
[343:14.45]Which waypoint is it to where we were?
[343:16.26]You can still do the Lucaria skip, apparently.
[343:21.46]Oh, Rhea's in the lake.
[343:23.82]That's right.
[343:25.66]The snake lizard kind of girl?
[343:28.27]She's in the lake.
[343:29.87]And I think she can TP you there, right?
[343:35.13]I don't know.
[343:36.25]Can we actually do that?
[343:37.47]Because we could just do that right now.
[343:41.79]I forget where... She's sitting around somewhere here, right?
[343:44.37]Alright.
[343:46.65]Go to... What's a good place to go?
[343:49.96]Probably the Laskia Ruins?
[343:55.32]We'll go from there?
[343:56.88]Yep.
[344:10.51]Yeah, she's gonna be one of the gazebo buildings.
[344:24.42]OK.
[344:27.61]Watch out giant.
[344:40.05]I'm not following you.
[344:42.53]She's in one of those.
[344:43.21]Oh, there's a basement here.
[344:47.52]Let's do it.
[344:58.26]Free shit.
[345:00.33]Can't go wrong there.
[345:01.17]Oh, freezing grease.
[345:04.89]I can respec again, or maybe you could because I just got a larval tier.
[345:10.56]Cool, I already have.
[345:11.48]I still have one.
[345:12.06]I think I have two.
[345:17.94]Alright.
[345:20.42]You know what?
[345:20.78]Let's get the map here.
[345:24.27]Much easier.
[345:28.21]Why am I fighting this thing?
[345:33.19]Because it's fun.
[345:40.96]Where's the map?
[345:44.36]Where's the map?
[345:47.62]I want to freeze frame that.
[345:48.94]You got like Photoshop smudge tooled across my screen.
[346:02.65]What about the typing test?
[346:05.05]Oh, yeah, I'm kind of tired though.
[346:07.78]We need to do that on a high energy start of the stream.
[346:11.04]I forgot to do that.
[346:13.99]I've been being reminded, but like, dude, I want to play Elden Ring.
[346:18.63]Like, come on.
[346:21.07]Yeah.
[346:21.83]I'm with him now.
[346:22.55]It needs to be like a fresh day.
[346:24.81]You got to be like fully ready.
[346:25.87]You got to prepare.
[346:26.58]It's true.
[346:27.40]Alright.
[346:27.88]Where is this?
[346:28.96]We need to go to follow me.
[346:31.16]I want the map.
[346:32.10]I hate looking at the no.
[346:33.10]You know what I mean?
[346:35.48]I don't like looking at the undiscovered area.
[346:40.55]I hate undiscovered area.
[346:44.61]Sister, I have to ask you this question.
[346:51.62]Hi.
[346:52.30]We planned on this weekend being an Elden Ring co-op stream weekend.
[346:57.10]But... How do you feel?
[347:00.71]You want to keep... You want to beat this?
[347:02.41]You want to try to beat the game on randomizer?
[347:08.55]I'm still enjoying it.
[347:10.43]I don't know when would be good.
[347:12.65]Like, when do you want to play again?
[347:14.61]What's your schedule look like over the next, like, this week?
[347:18.97]I don't know.
[347:19.63]Weekend again or something?
[347:20.59]Just have it be a weekend thing till we beat it?
[347:25.16]Or, you know, you got stuff going on on the weekend, right?
[347:31.54]I think if you wanted to play again tomorrow, I could do that and then we could make it a weekend thing.
[347:36.35]I cannot play tomorrow.
[347:38.69]Okay, I think it would be the most responsible thing to do to make it a weekend thing.
[347:44.21]Same deal like Saturday, Sunday.
[347:46.43]Yeah.
[347:51.05]That sounds good to me.
[347:52.39]Nice.
[347:52.95]Okay, so where is her gazebo?
[347:58.37]Is it this one?
[348:00.04]Is it this one?
[348:00.94]Is it this one?
[348:02.96]Jack, can we help her?
[348:04.22]Where is her gazebo?
[348:09.43]They are never playing this again.
[348:10.73]Yes, we are.
[348:14.94]Bottom right.
[348:15.96]This one here.
[348:17.24]Why would you doubt?
[348:19.62]Why doubt?
[348:20.20]They are never doing this again.
[348:21.78]We're playing so much.
[348:22.66]We're like not going to the bathroom.
[348:24.44]And it's like nine hour streams.
[348:26.64]I'm like, I'm going to piss, but this is fun.
[348:29.28]So fun.
[348:30.46]They ain't ever fucking coming back.
[348:32.22]Never again.
[348:35.26]I think it's this one.
[348:35.98]It's the one next to the telescope.
[348:42.25]Oh, OK, it's this one.
[348:43.15]Alright, all the way south is right next to the bonfire.
[348:57.43]Oh, I know I know an area I also would like to do is the we have the waypoint to the underground, that one mine that we teleported to for the sleepy chest.
[349:08.21]Yeah, but we like never actually did the mine.
[349:12.38]There should be a lot of stuff in there and a boss at the end.
[349:14.24]Alright, she's in here.
[349:16.12]Are you here with me?
[349:17.68]I'm not.
[349:21.37]You should probably be here in case the host needs to do something.
[349:26.97]I'm coming.
[349:29.01]How far away are you?
[349:30.15]Oh god, you're pretty far.
[349:32.91]Okay.
[349:36.11]My game crashed.
[349:39.05]Oh no!
[349:39.99]I'm going to get teleported out!
[349:43.21]I'm going to not touch anything because I feel like I'm about to leave and it's going to break the game if I do anything.
[349:56.93]Am I going to get booted?
[350:07.94]Yes, this is a seamless co-op.
[350:12.50]Also randomizers as well.
[350:16.88]Those are the only two things we have on is item randomizer, enemy randomizer, and seamless call.
[350:33.77]I'm inviting you to my game now.
[350:36.48]Thank you.
[350:38.78]Thank you.
[350:44.59]I did not switch to a faith build.
[350:46.36]I just put enough points into faith so I could use this weapon.
[350:50.74]It's a strength weapon, but it is faith at the same time.
[350:53.72]I think if I find a faith ash of war, that's like my sign to switch.
[351:00.64]Or if I find one of the spells I want, it's my sign to not switch.
[351:04.82]That's like I'm waiting for either of those.
[351:12.53]The Diablo style loot mod might be fun.
[351:16.77]Where am I?
[351:19.01]Yeah, that does seem interesting.
[351:21.49]I wonder how elaborate it is.
[351:23.71]I looked into it and the answer is not very.
[351:26.26]No.
[351:26.42]Okay, we need to go back down.
[351:31.44]Oh, it's right here.
[351:33.14]Okay, good.
[351:40.87]So what does it do?
[351:41.41]It kind of, you pick up an item and it's, oh, long sword of the eagle.
[351:45.65]And it's just random stats on it.
[351:47.15]I think it's like preset to have ashes of war or like specific types of, uh, enhancements on it.
[351:54.52]And it could be like a plus one or whatever.
[351:56.26]It could just, it's like, just, I read like it was just an extra layer to the randomizer.
[352:04.84]Why are you wearing the same clothes from your first playthrough?
[352:10.55]I don't know.
[352:10.91]I have... I don't just, like, wear shirts and then throw them away.
[352:14.39]I wash them and wear them again a week or so later.
[352:23.36]She wants us to go get her necklace back from a thug from a shack.
[352:28.18]Yeah, so we gotta go talk to the... There's a guy that makes, like, shrimps or something over here.
[352:32.68]Oh, Lobster Boy?
[352:34.80]Yes.
[352:35.70]Let me do this, too.
[352:39.55]What if we kill her?
[352:41.25]That would be bad because that would probably break the game.
[352:43.53]And the whole reason why we're doing this is to make sure we can get to the manor promptly.
[352:50.00]Alright, the shack.
[352:51.02]If I remember the shack, it's right here.
[352:56.66]Chat.
[352:58.18]Declose in the game.
[353:00.22]Oh, oh.
[353:01.84]It's randomizer.
[353:03.18]I don't know.
[353:06.60]Is it down?
[353:07.24]It's right here, right?
[353:08.14]It's like right here.
[353:08.82]I think it's this one right here.
[353:09.76]Yeah, it's right here.
[353:16.45]I wasn't wearing this earlier.
[353:17.59]I had the blade helmet on.
[353:19.65]I had this.
[353:21.07]I had this.
[353:22.55]Yeah, I looked much different in this playthrough.
[353:27.29]You look cute.
[353:31.11]I think I look pretty good.
[353:44.38]Alright, question for Ster.
[353:45.46]Did you ever come here?
[353:46.66]No.
[353:53.05]Never came here.
[353:54.33]I have read I like knew all about the shack and what was here and it was like this place is like it's all foggy.
[354:00.01]I never saw it.
[354:00.61]I think maybe once I like dedicated to coming here.
[354:05.56]I feel like you just beat all the bosses.
[354:08.58]You just kind of went boss to boss to boss.
[354:12.25]I didn't do a lot of the quest lines because they're also convoluted I did like ronnie's this is important like I never want to do that ever again how do we not screw this up do we just like what give give me the necklace I forget well how do we make sure we get to the manor well he's selling an item and it is not a necklace you need to ask him and he you have to pay him
[354:39.12]Yeah, and I go into the shop, and he's trying to sell me a laughing smile mask.
[354:43.88]Okay.
[354:45.30]Oh, shit.
[354:45.88]Or the prattling paint hello.
[354:48.18]Okay, I bought it.
[354:50.10]Hold on.
[354:50.50]Deal.
[354:50.88]Fuck.
[354:51.06]Okay, thanks for the Smithing Stone.
[355:09.40]I think we broke it.
[355:12.00]I mean, he... I bought... I don't know.
[355:15.21]Does that technically count?
[355:16.69]Does the quest... I wonder if the game is like, oh, you bought that thing from the guy.
[355:36.84]Kill him.
[355:38.26]Wait, kill him.
[355:38.80]He might have it on him, right?
[355:40.74]He won't have it on him.
[355:41.84]No, he won't.
[355:48.34]Hey, excuse me, sir.
[355:50.34]Sir.
[355:50.90]Don't kill him.
[355:51.42]People are freaking out.
[355:52.20]They're saying don't kill him.
[355:55.32]Do not kill him.
[355:56.18]Do not.
[355:56.62]Don't.
[355:56.92]Don't, sir.
[355:57.56]No.
[355:57.92]Uh-oh.
[356:00.76]He's going to fight.
[356:01.44]He hit me first.
[356:04.02]Don't touch my friend.
[356:05.92]Even though he's antagonized and he's completely at fault.
[356:12.47]Oh, and now you're going to heal during a fight.
[356:16.97]I got plenty in mine.
[356:19.53]Oh, it's delicious.
[356:22.15]Wish you had more than one, didn't you?
[356:30.00]Why did you do that?
[356:30.66]That was mean.
[356:31.84]I got the iron ball.
[356:33.44]Yeah, it's not going to work.
[356:36.93]That was him.
[356:37.65]I know.
[356:38.05]Look, I participated, but he... What was it?
[356:41.63]Come on.
[356:43.61]Is it worse to kill the guy?
[356:45.13]I don't know.
[356:45.83]I think... Or to drink elixirs over his body to show him like that you would have lived.
[356:51.03]Here's the thing.
[356:52.13]But I think we needed that guy alive for some very important reason.
[356:56.26]We don't need him.
[356:57.34]I did like a jokey... Like, oh, look, I'm doing a joke.
[357:01.22]You killed the guy.
[357:02.56]You started the fight and that ruined our playthrough.
[357:06.24]Our playthrough is ruined.
[357:08.55]I guess we're not going to play on weekends anymore.
[357:10.27]They were right.
[357:12.21]So what do we do about this?
[357:16.23]How about... We get to the manor and there are like seven other ways that we can do it.
[357:22.91]Alright, that sounds easy.
[357:25.05]Oh, wait, I can't buy prawns.
[357:26.79]I can't buy the shrimps anymore.
[357:28.98]He doesn't sell them.
[357:30.32]Yes, he does.
[357:30.84]I just bought a bunch of them.
[357:35.00]I just bought a shitload of them.
[357:36.82]Oh, my God.
[357:37.28]These things are amazing.
[357:38.96]Yes, he was.
[357:39.52]Look.
[357:41.22]The other merchant?
[357:42.84]Boiled prawn.
[357:44.80]Oh, no.
[357:45.68]Those are huge.
[357:46.74]I can't believe you killed that guy and taunted and... Oh, the ball bearing.
[357:53.16]We're good.
[357:53.59]God damn it, dude.
[357:55.19]Okay.
[357:55.67]So... That randomizer makes that way to do that impossible.
[358:01.19]So... What if we just walk in?
[358:09.70]Grabs it better.
[358:11.87]Vote.
[358:16.29]Try talking to Raya anyways.
[358:19.40]No.
[358:21.30]She's a snake.
[358:22.82]Spoilers.
[358:26.32]I played an entire playthrough with a snake, and it was one of the most loyal, one of the smartest, and most fun.
[358:35.94]Had a lot of fun moments with that snake.
[358:38.55]What are you talking about?
[358:39.79]I played through my first playthrough.
[358:41.75]My first playthrough of Elden Ring was with the snake spirit summons.
[358:44.57]I summoned him all the time.
[358:47.87]Okay.
[358:48.49]It was... That's the...
[358:52.27]You're talking about how Rhea is a snake.
[358:55.65]She's bad.
[358:56.97]Why is that?
[358:57.95]She's a bad type of snake.
[359:00.99]Okay.
[359:03.43]She can't be with the other snakes.
[359:07.72]There's a lot of smithing stones here.
[359:09.16]Holy shit.
[359:16.18]Chester.
[359:22.80]Empty.
[359:24.16]We already got that.
[359:27.18]I'm surprised you could open it again, but we already did that.
[359:29.64]In mod chat, I got something.
[359:30.65]Here's the path to the manor.
[359:33.73]You gotta loop around the mountain.
[359:35.59]Mods are backseating.
[359:38.29]Like you were gonna get us there any quicker.
[359:42.11]Okay.
[359:43.27]Yeah, there's actually... I have a mod GPS here.
[359:47.17]me see if I can look at this in a map I need to dude people were telling me the mod allows you to use the teleporter lady at the bottom of the thing with the we could just go that way if that's true if you're that committed no no you're I think you're misunderstanding me like my mod like mod chat like my Twitch mods I know I'm saying something else you're not understanding me we just double miscommunicated with each other
[360:10.62]Okay.
[360:11.74]No, just once, and it was you.
[360:14.88]Just the one time.
[360:16.55]You didn't understand.
[360:18.09]Oh, sorry about that.
[360:24.45]Is he high?
[360:26.08]No!
[360:30.04]I'm really not.
[360:30.74]I don't know why I keep doing that.
[360:41.31]There's a cave after you defeat... Bottom of Raya Lucaria, loop around, there's a maiden machine?
[360:48.29]Oh, dude, that's right!
[360:52.11]I completely forgot about that!
[360:53.81]Hey, I got a better idea.
[360:55.99]I got a better idea.
[360:57.51]We are going to go... What?
[361:04.85]ray lucari at the bottom of the thing you go into the machine and it takes you to the place and at first I was like let's do that and I was like wait it's randomizer we can't do that the enemy will be different and you were like oh and then someone in my chat was like no and the mod it's the same and I said that to you and you were like oh okay so maybe we can do it so what are we doing here there's a boss in the dungeon let's do it bro you're not even listed
[361:34.04]How come you never listen?
[361:37.58]I did listen.
[361:38.16]I just... I thought when you were saying that, I thought you said that it wasn't possible.
[361:44.44]So I was like, okay, it's not possible.
[361:46.05]Then when we were told it was possible, in my mind, it was like, why?
[361:48.93]What are we doing here?
[361:50.21]I thought you were trying to find something here that was... Like, I thought you were abandoning the manor.
[361:55.23]Like, no, no, no.
[361:55.93]Let's fuck that.
[361:56.51]Let's do something else.
[361:59.42]I just want to do this.
[362:01.12]I thought, but I thought you were abandoning like us going to the manor.
[362:03.68]Like, nah, fucking whatever.
[362:04.66]We can't go there.
[362:05.44]Or maybe we can, but we can't.
[362:08.62]Where was all this backseating from your mods when we were trying to find Radon?
[362:14.32]It was there.
[362:14.68]I just didn't look for an hour.
[362:18.59]Okay, this is all making a lot more sense.
[362:19.85]I'm just being honest.
[362:21.82]When I play Elden Ring, games that require focus or like don't get hit, it's I'm here and I'm only here and it's the only place that I am.
[362:31.10]It's also hilarious that you have like a mod chat and you call it your mod chat, but it's actually like, can you guys tell me how to play this game chat?
[362:38.64]No, no, it's not.
[362:39.64]No, it is not.
[362:40.42]No, it's not.
[362:42.18]You're talking about one or two scenarios over the course of like 16 hours we've been streaming this.
[362:47.52]I believe that a lot more scenarios have come up and you just don't talk about it.
[362:50.86]Like this whole time you've been getting, hey, Jeremy, you forgot to, you need to like upgrade, you have a plus five somber stone.
[362:58.18]And then you just act like, oh yeah, you don't like, don't bring up that it was from mod chat.
[363:03.29]He ignores us too, sad face, sad face.
[363:13.33]I'm in, I'm here.
[363:14.53]I'm in here right now.
[363:16.92]I can't
[363:37.82]Someone accused you of not being here.
[363:39.76]Wait, what?
[363:41.12]I'm just I'm just saying I'm I'm in here.
[363:44.03]I'm focusing here.
[363:45.57]And if you said something, I may not have heard it.
[363:47.99]I may have heard it in process.
[363:49.27]I'm here and I'm fighting.
[364:00.69]I hope I can give this to you because I think that's important.
[364:09.09]I thought that was in the game.
[364:10.13]I was like, what the fuck is that?
[364:11.79]There's a guy going to get you.
[364:14.67]I can't leave this.
[364:18.56]Now leave.
[364:19.12]We're watching Sopranos.
[364:20.70]You guys are always watching Sopranos in the mod chat.
[364:23.24]Like, what is this?
[364:23.96]You guys are on a Sopranos kick.
[364:26.82]Woke up this morning.
[364:32.86]Did you drop it?
[364:34.34]I can't.
[364:34.84]It's bound.
[364:36.86]Wasn't this a fun dungeon?
[364:39.52]It was, yeah.
[364:40.70]I like this place.
[364:42.14]Okay.
[364:51.12]What'd you do to my computer?
[364:54.22]I hacked it.
[364:55.06]When I gave you the .NET framework install, you were correct to avoid it.
[364:59.51]That's like a graphics card artifacting.
[365:04.15]Or it's a secret area, and that's fucking cool.
[365:11.70]That's a graphical error secret area.
[365:15.78]Alright, so let's do the thing we were going to do.
[365:18.32]The thing that I was not ignoring you about.
[365:20.40]The thing that I just miscommunicated to myself in my own head.
[365:23.80]That I thought we were abandoning that mission.
[365:26.15]I looked over at Mod Chat and watching The Sopranos.
[365:28.67]Nobody wants to fucking help me.
[365:37.41]Did they get to the part where Tony hits the gas tank?
[365:45.06]I don't know.
[365:46.42]It failed.
[366:00.31]Classroom?
[366:01.17]Oh.
[366:02.99]Yeah, you're right.
[366:03.63]I fucked up.
[366:05.51]Oh, that's right.
[366:06.87]I forgot.
[366:07.23]That's from when we were playing.
[366:14.17]What was that, Dead by Daylight?
[366:17.67]Um... Dying Light 2.
[366:19.80]Yeah.
[366:21.82]I picked the wrong one.
[366:22.50]We got a classroom.
[366:35.60]Not Dead by Daylight.
[366:36.56]Sorry, Dead... Light... Daylight... Dead by Daylight... Dead... Deadlight... Dying... Light... Deadlight Rising?
[366:44.43]Rising light.
[366:46.15]Over light.
[367:01.52]My fucking game crashed.
[367:08.22]Okay, um, I'm coming back.
[367:09.70]Alrighty then.
[367:21.87]We're getting extra crashes today.
[367:23.48]Is it because we're going deeper into the game and there's more places for errors?
[367:27.84]I have no idea.
[367:30.24]And it feels about the same to me.
[367:31.82]I feel like I've crashed a lot more today than yesterday.
[367:49.19]Come on, please open.
[368:05.90]Dude, you can buy Spider-Man in Fortnite, man.
[368:10.68]Cool.
[368:18.02]Spider-Man 1, 2, or 3.
[368:18.60]I don't know.
[368:18.94]Okay.
[368:25.62]I... We... I need to... We're in the wrong spot.
[368:28.38]Where are you?
[368:32.90]I... Does it matter?
[368:35.93]Does it... Sometimes it pulls me, right?
[368:37.67]Does it pull me where you are?
[368:39.21]Yeah.
[368:40.39]I feel like sometimes it's not done that.
[368:43.83]It puts me somewhere random.
[368:52.44]Has it always done that?
[368:53.16]Maybe it's because it... No, it just puts me in a weird spot near you, right?
[368:57.56]We used to try and be in the same location, but then I realized it didn't matter.
[369:03.38]Okay.
[369:06.12]Alright, so we have to get to the very bottom of this shit.
[369:17.25]I'm going down.
[369:17.95]You didn't even do it like a Chad like I did.
[369:20.89]Oh, you're such a Chad.
[369:24.33]You're such a Chad.
[369:29.60]Wanna jump off in the midway?
[369:32.74]I'm jumping.
[369:34.02]You're gonna go?
[369:34.84]Are you doing it?
[369:35.44]Yeah, because over here you get the secret ingredient.
[369:49.67]Oh, my God.
[369:50.37]This is a horrible spot right now.
[369:53.82]Careful.
[369:55.08]A missed begotten.
[369:56.78]I got some cotton.
[370:01.24]Am I dead?
[370:07.97]Oh, I had animation priority.
[370:10.21]You didn't.
[370:11.45]Whose idea was this?
[370:14.27]I'm actually really glad we came over here because it's legendary here.
[370:17.35]For me, at least.
[370:27.92]This actually is something you might want.
[370:30.22]I know they nerfed it, but still.
[370:32.38]Spaghetti?
[370:33.26]It's the Sword of Night and Flame.
[370:36.00]I do want that.
[370:36.80]You probably want this.
[370:39.14]If I were Ster, I would probably say give that to me immediately.
[370:42.46]I do believe they nerfed it into the ground, though.
[370:52.91]I feel like I used it in a run that I did off stream and it was still pretty good.
[370:58.82]Alright, is this thing actually down here?
[371:20.49]So what happens if it's not down here?
[371:29.20]It's just an Omega bird.
[371:35.81]Wait, let it kill you?
[371:36.59]Wait, wait, wait.
[371:38.53]No, let it kill you.
[371:41.11]Let it kill you?
[371:41.77]Alright, I'm going to die here.
[371:44.07]Let's see what happens.
[371:45.60]Don't kill this.
[371:48.74]Still saying exile?
[371:56.94]Can you like take it?
[371:57.80]I don't like punch it.
[372:00.15]It's going to kill you.
[372:00.95]Apparently it doesn't care about me.
[372:02.29]I feel like this thing kills me so fast and now I just can't.
[372:13.77]It won't hurt me.
[372:18.73]I didn't know that there was more to this area.
[372:21.44]He's crushed me in the head over and over again.
[372:28.59]Okay.
[372:30.49]Did it work?
[372:35.83]Alright.
[372:39.68]I... It works.
[372:45.32]Let it kill you.
[372:47.08]Really?
[372:47.82]It actually works.
[372:51.83]You just have to die in that area.
[372:53.95]I guess the game doesn't really care what kills you.
[372:58.41]I lost 17,000 souls.
[372:59.89]I did, but it's worth it because we get to be here.
[373:02.84]It's not a lot anymore.
[373:05.04]No, I'm a little 72.
[373:07.84]It's not like I'm level like 40 or something.
[373:16.04]I don't mean to like brag or anything, but it's killing me way quicker.
[373:26.27]Never mind.
[373:28.74]I'm watching you get hit by it, but you haven't been hit in a while.
[373:32.68]How are you watching me get hit by it if you teleport it?
[373:35.58]Because you just got hit.
[373:36.48]You just got hit again.
[373:38.04]291 damage.
[373:41.30]You can see the hit points.
[373:43.82]I can see your character dying and getting hurt, but you're like floating up here.
[373:57.69]Hey, there is the light.
[373:59.69]I can now, there's like shadows now.
[374:01.41]I couldn't see anything before really.
[374:06.13]We're in the manor.
[374:09.48]I actually liked this place.
[374:11.30]That was cool.
[374:16.58]But I mean, it makes sense.
[374:17.50]My element is fire, so.
[374:18.54]I mean, of course, of course, I'm going to like this place.
[374:26.07]I'm more of a wind.
[374:29.47]Whoa.
[374:31.25]That's a rare item.
[374:33.33]You need to do a full quest to get that shit.
[374:48.60]Every time I hit a wall, you also then follow me in hitting the wall.
[374:57.04]I don't like it.
[375:07.24]Yeah, my element is fire.
[375:09.66]My herb is turmeric.
[375:12.66]And my animal is... How do you determine your herb?
[375:19.16]Whatever one you like the most.
[375:20.98]The one you like.
[375:21.58]Turmeric is your favorite herb.
[375:32.77]Okay.
[375:32.99]Why did you laugh?
[375:33.89]That made it really weird.
[375:38.15]Because I'm laughing at what somebody said in chat.
[375:42.23]Somebody wrote, like, your favorite herb with a question mark.
[375:45.71]Like, it was, like, what is that supposed to mean?
[375:47.85]It was, I don't know.
[375:48.41]It was funny.
[375:49.43]Okay.
[375:50.33]Did you come?
[375:50.73]Okay.
[375:52.15]We're a little de-thinked.
[375:54.45]We're good.
[375:55.61]You made, like, a bridge of people.
[375:57.87]Yeah.
[375:58.27]You just walk right over them.
[376:04.70]Ah!
[376:17.84]Oh, some fun enemies.
[376:25.31]What, what, what?
[376:30.85]There's some de-syncing going on.
[376:33.07]There likely is.
[376:43.21]The boss down here is... What is it normally?
[376:45.99]Is it one of those winged... Magma lizard.
[376:48.33]How is it?
[377:00.01]What the fuck are you doing?
[377:01.46]I'm sorry.
[377:02.42]I'm doing it on purpose now.
[377:03.58]I was going to see.
[377:04.74]I was also doing it on purpose to see if you would do it.
[377:07.34]So we're like double downing, double getting each other.
[377:10.34]Yeah, you were trying to bait me to do it.
[377:13.64]And I was trying to make you think that you were baiting me into doing it.
[377:19.08]Thus, I'm the one that wins.
[377:21.42]There's a winner in this situation.
[377:22.79]Yes, and it's me.
[377:23.97]It's so crazy how he won there.
[377:52.71]How is Rykard gonna work?
[377:57.79]What do you mean?
[377:59.63]I mean, we might still have to hit it with the spear.
[378:02.57]We also might not.
[378:04.09]I think Randomizer does obey the spear rule.
[378:07.17]It's just anything in that room, the boss needs to be hit by the spear.
[378:12.29]Okay.
[378:12.47]Okay.
[378:31.87]shield crash that's a fun ability I don't think I've ever seen it before you get that with like there's the big spike tower shield I was really I was really trying to make it work for a while are you one of those people that try to do a shield build where you just put two shields on I mean everyone's like tried it thanks
[379:12.42]When we make it out of here, we're still going to need to loop around the mountain to get inside the actual manor.
[379:17.34]Yeah, that's right.
[379:18.68]Yeah, that's fine.
[379:21.06]Just a fun little jolly adventure amongst friends.
[379:25.48]A little bit of gallivanting.
[379:28.30]Oh, you enter first there, pal.
[379:31.10]Okay.
[379:31.24]How do you feel about cilantro?
[379:34.70]Somebody asked.
[379:40.04]Why bother is kind of how I feel.
[379:41.96]Like, why?
[379:42.30]I don't even know how to answer.
[379:50.47]I don't like it.
[379:51.13]I don't like it.
[379:52.07]I don't like it.
[379:53.63]This is kind of a mess.
[379:56.87]Okay.
[379:57.25]This is how it was designed.
[380:00.81]Right.
[380:01.73]It's not like this is out of the ordinary.
[380:04.65]Like, oh my God, what a tiny little area.
[380:06.27]This is so ridiculous.
[380:07.27]Randomizer.
[380:08.05]No, this is like, yeah, this is by design.
[380:09.75]You fight this guy in a smaller area probably.
[380:12.67]You do.
[380:16.44]You actually do.
[380:29.00]He's going to explode.
[380:57.66]Ooh, end it with a flashy move.
[381:05.37]Cracked pot.
[381:06.29]Rune arc.
[381:14.26]by gosh we've done it mm-hmm oh no you're de-sinking
[381:43.24]Uh, I've discovered a Lost Grace over here.
[381:45.72]Mm-hmm.
[381:50.44]Uh, do I... No, like 30,000.
[381:51.78]That's not happening for a while.
[382:00.48]Ah!
[382:05.58]Ah!
[382:07.35]Ah.
[382:12.41]Ah.
[382:13.72]OK, we need to go.
[382:14.51]Around the mountain.
[382:17.09]Do you know where you're going?
[382:18.21]Because I do you do OK, but I don't want to go where you're about to go.
[382:24.29]And I'll give you one good reason.
[382:26.47]Why is that?
[382:28.19]Because there's usually the Mariner boss up here and I want to fight it, whatever it is.
[382:32.12]The good point.
[382:36.84]Right?
[382:42.92]Go north through the canyon and hug the left side.
[382:45.10]Yeah, he's just doing his own thing right now.
[383:03.39]Isn't this part of the fun of Elden Ring?
[383:04.95]Just going on an adventure and not knowing what lies beyond?
[383:09.78]Right over here, there's a giant tree stalker, man.
[383:13.02]Ooh, there is.
[383:16.08]Which one is it?
[383:16.58]Is it the putrid one?
[383:19.43]That's fun.
[383:20.33]This one actually really sucks.
[383:24.85]Hit me with that.
[383:36.66]Oh, but you got a fire weapon.
[383:40.48]Careful.
[383:47.97]Not if I get stomped on the ground before being able to stand up.
[384:16.93]Watch out!
[384:17.89]Oh!
[384:18.51]Who put that rock there?
[384:25.63]They trolled you with that rock.
[384:32.65]I had that and I feel bad that I died.
[384:35.09]I feel like a loser that I died, but also you died like 10 minutes before me.
[384:39.51]Ster the boss had like 75% health remaining.
[384:49.26]We go again.
[384:50.64]Yes.
[384:55.08]Oh, the vibes weren't there.
[384:56.49]Vibes are there now.
[384:59.33]Yeah, they're really kind of like trolling.
[385:08.19]No, no shield.
[385:09.33]Shield.
[385:10.67]Shield.
[385:37.15]Does that really not do that much?
[385:43.33]Really not even worth doing that.
[386:22.27]It's like I hear my character go, I'm over it.
[386:54.71]no keep pounding your ass into the gravel uh get away from me and again
[387:31.12]Ooh, that looks cool.
[387:34.34]Flashy end.
[387:39.27]That'd be worth probably a lot, right?
[387:43.85]Eh.
[387:45.25]Did I get Glove Ward?
[387:55.14]Okay, that was just the epic combat that I needed to get my blood flowing for our future adventures.
[388:01.68]What did you eat today?
[388:04.70]For breakfast, I had... I had like Italian sausages and I wrapped them in naan bread.
[388:11.51]Damn, that sounds good.
[388:14.49]It actually really was.
[388:15.39]I could go again.
[388:18.13]Did you like peppers and onions or anything like that?
[388:20.95]Or just no, just straight up?
[388:24.36]it was like in a hurry and I didn't have much food and I needed to eat before gym so I was like I don't I don't know I'm going with what I got that's not like like what you want to be eaten before you go to the gym but also that is what I ate hey there's nothing wrong with that do you like hummus
[388:44.22]I do.
[388:45.16]I'm a hummus liker.
[388:46.08]Yeah, because you mentioned non-bread.
[388:49.30]Non-bread and hummus.
[388:50.28]I randomly tried it not that long ago and realized I've been missing out.
[388:53.80]At first I was like, hummus is okay.
[388:55.87]And I've kind of had a lot of okay hummus.
[388:58.61]And then I got turned on to some like sriracha hummus.
[389:02.39]It's really good.
[389:07.25]Wait a minute.
[389:11.91]Run that by me one more time.
[389:14.15]Sriracha hummus was the keyword.
[389:18.41]Say the first word again.
[389:23.53]Say the first word you just said.
[389:29.53]I will not apologize.
[389:30.49]Sriracha.
[389:32.13]It's new to me.
[389:35.28]You're a Sriracha enjoyer?
[389:36.84]Yeah, that's
[389:48.02]That's how it's going to be said.
[389:52.94]Bro, I gotta go.
[389:53.70]I gotta go.
[389:56.90]I got stuff to do later.
[389:58.40]Okay, I'm not sure if this is... Now I'm confused.
[390:04.91]I think I gotta go.
[390:05.71]Okay.
[390:05.97]You want to end here?
[390:12.39]Do you actually like Sriracha?
[390:13.85]Are you like a Sriracha fan?
[390:15.03]I thought at first it was that I was pronouncing it so fucking bad.
[390:18.07]That was like embarrassing.
[390:19.63]That's what I thought at first.
[390:21.05]Those Jalapenos.
[390:25.51]I'll take a Jalapeno.
[390:27.37]Sriracha.
[390:29.91]I love Sriracha.
[390:30.99]I've actually like never had it at all, but I tried the hummus and it's very good.
[390:38.26]and I have a local local streamer penta also I told him I like that his eyes lit up like I've never seen a human being excited before to tell me how much he also loves the heb brand sriracha hummus so I think I'm on to something I just think sriracha just I think it just tastes like kind of just it's got like an odd flavor that I don't really like
[391:04.30]It's just kind of like... I don't even know what regular sriracha tastes like.
[391:09.00]I feel like this hummus is probably not it.
[391:20.05]Hey, I have something you need to look up.
[391:23.07]Oh, the meteorite staff?
[391:24.27]Yes.
[391:25.27]There's a bunch of snitches in my chat.
[391:28.48]Like, we'll get to it.
[391:32.95]I would love it if I can also get a meteorite spell.
[391:36.01]You know what's funny to me is I think they're doing that because I think that they're so concerned.
[391:41.52]They're watching both streams and they see me pick up an item that you could use.
[391:45.40]And I think they think I'm just a dummy and I'm never going to tell you that I picked this up.
[391:49.18]It's going to be gone from my brain.
[391:50.28]So they're just spamming you to tell me to give this to you because they know that they could get your attention.
[391:55.77]So you'll tell me is on the ground.
[392:00.89]Right where I'm standing.
[392:03.83]I walked down to the bonfire Ster just picked up a large club I did how come nobody in my chat is telling me about this item that I would like every single time there's like a strength weapon that's found you go look at this and you walk around you swing it like twice and you're like maybe I'll upgrade that and then we never talk about it again and then we keep using the weapon that you're using
[392:26.80]I just don't want to derail.
[392:28.06]VR Josh literally said it.
[392:29.34]Yeah, but I may have been looking over here.
[392:31.08]Remember, for the streamer to see what you're saying, you have to do it for at least 20 to 30 seconds.
[392:38.32]Because if I'm looking over here and it's like, club, club, club, club, club.
[392:41.54]Hey, Jerma, did you pee your pants today?
[392:43.12]Poop, poop, poop.
[392:43.94]And I'm like, oh, it's gone.
[392:45.44]It's gone.
[392:45.89]I don't see it anymore.
[392:46.87]I look over and it's not being talked about.
[392:49.15]Did you pee your pants, you poopoo baby?
[392:52.21]Okay.
[392:54.03]No, I'm going to stick with this.
[392:56.82]yeah I know it's not even like a cool large club it's just like the most basic caveman wood club it's kind of the character I'm playing though it's like me strong supposed to be a caveman it's the character you were supposed to play not the character you're playing and you were well we're well past that and it's fine I mean you're supposed to be me smart and you're swinging around a sword
[393:23.38]Uh, an intelligence, uh, sword that has magic scaling on it.
[393:27.59]This is a huge club squished sideways and has fire on it.
[393:31.93]Okay, but like, uh, mom says you have to put it down.
[393:40.47]Poison, get out.
[393:45.02]Oh, this is the fucking place where the goobs are!
[393:55.21]I'm going goob mode.
[394:07.28]Oh, okay.
[394:07.78]We're waiting for you to do that.
[394:09.44]Well, I might as well do it too.
[394:15.22]So you got poison resistance.
[394:18.22]Oh, I don't have the hat.
[394:19.14]I only have the body.
[394:21.38]You got the whole thing?
[394:23.05]Yeah.
[394:24.71]I'll be the one who doesn't get poisoned down here.
[394:26.83]That's too bad, because I like the way it looks.
[394:28.91]Okay.
[394:30.59]Yeah, you'll be back to the wolf.
[394:35.41]Don't worry.
[394:36.08]It makes sense.
[394:36.74]We look like the two jokey, dopey enemies in every kid's cartoon.
[394:43.58]We got some ceiling wolves.
[394:45.46]They might drop on you.
[394:46.46]Watch out.
[394:46.96]What?
[394:48.04]There's ceiling enemies in here.
[394:49.36]Look up.
[394:50.14]Look at that guy over there.
[394:52.88]Oh, there is.
[394:53.56]Yeah.
[394:55.28]Why am I supposed to be the goop?
[394:56.58]Why am I still getting poisoned?
[394:57.31]Oh, it's fucking dark here.
[394:59.35]It's because I rolled.
[395:01.17]Oh, god damn it.
[395:05.15]Don't roll, I forgot.
[395:09.18]Thanks for the starlight.
[395:12.18]Did you ever have the coke?
[395:13.04]Did you have coke starlight?
[395:13.88]Did you ever try it?
[395:14.32]It was really good.
[395:17.08]coke starlight after the fucking the superhero no it's like coca-cola cable was it was coke starlight it was very good I don't I'm not a coke I'm not a coker are you you're probably are you if you were to drink like a cola would you was it like Pepsi or if I were to drink a cola I honestly wouldn't be
[395:44.74]Okay.
[395:45.06]Well, here's something that you really want because this is one of my favorite abilities in the whole game.
[395:51.70]I genuinely mean that.
[395:52.65]I love that move.
[395:53.59]It's like my favorite spell.
[395:56.65]Ice Quag.
[395:57.37]Okay.
[395:58.07]That like ice glintstone kind of beam thing.
[396:00.39]They're like... That's probably my favorite spell.
[396:06.25]It's very fun.
[396:09.33]I just got a somber six.
[396:10.75]Uh-huh.
[396:14.90]What are you giggling at over there?
[396:17.20]Coke heads in chat fuming.
[396:19.22]I don't know.
[396:20.76]The word coke heads kind of had me laughing.
[396:25.56]I used to be, I used to not drink a lot of soda.
[396:27.88]Well, I drank a lot of soda before, but like in recent years, last like five years, I haven't really been drinking it that much.
[396:36.87]I'm not an enemy.
[396:37.61]I might look like one.
[396:40.35]Um, but.
[396:43.10]The little tiny little cans.
[396:45.94]They're like a nice little treat.
[396:47.16]Like a nice little dessert.
[396:52.43]I don't drink a full soda anymore.
[396:54.55]It's kind of cool.
[396:57.49]It kind of sits in me.
[397:02.27]Like a nice little dessert.
[397:04.31]I'm not too much of a carbonated man myself.
[397:10.29]Every once in a while, you know, you never really go for one.
[397:14.45]He's lying.
[397:20.34]Jerma's lying?
[397:21.26]He goes hard?
[397:23.22]You've seen the cans I drink out of on stream.
[397:26.02]You've seen them over the last month or two.
[397:34.99]I didn't think that thing was dead.
[397:35.93]I thought it was going to blow up.
[397:38.67]I kind of did too, and I'm going to die if I don't heal.
[397:45.83]Oh, that's right.
[397:46.35]I did try that weird milk and... It's supposed to be milk and Pepsi, but... This thing is probably good for you.
[397:59.69]Is it good for you?
[398:01.79]Golden Order Seal.
[398:05.20]I'll take it.
[398:06.22]It's Int and Faith.
[398:08.46]So, I think it's fundamental incantations.
[398:11.70]Yeah, I'll take it.
[398:17.15]I don't want to equip it.
[398:28.52]They discard really should not be right next to leave.
[398:31.62]I feel like it should be like two rungs down on the menu ladder.
[398:35.44]I feel like they should make the word delete.
[398:38.88]But you know, where's that DLC?
[398:43.05]Where's that DLC?
[398:45.92]Hey, look, I was one of those people that said, man, no DLC.
[398:50.39]What's going on here?
[398:52.81]Look at this game.
[398:54.77]This game already feels like it has 10 pieces of DLC on it.
[398:59.41]That is true.
[399:01.35]Like, I feel like if you told me that this game that I have here was like four DLCs were on it.
[399:11.94]You're murdering them.
[399:20.41]but I kind of can't see I got my guy I got my guy you got your guy I mean I'm working on it what is normally down here I feel like that's normally down here
[399:49.10]Am I crazy or is that actually down here?
[399:51.24]I don't remember.
[399:58.12]It's two random bug guys.
[400:00.74]Oh, it's yeah.
[400:01.46]With the.
[400:02.48]Oh.
[400:02.86]The ship.
[400:04.58]You know what I mean?
[400:05.80]The bug guys.
[400:06.72]Bug guys.
[400:07.62]They're like the shrimp bugs and they have the things that porcupine things that.
[400:13.14]A clean rotten nights.
[400:15.36]The game crashed.
[400:16.84]No.
[400:21.59]I think you crashed it when you made that noise.
[400:30.20]They confirm the DLC by saying they're not done with the game.
[400:32.64]Yeah, but they can take as much time as they want.
[400:35.30]Like, look at this fucking game.
[400:38.38]We're so spoiled rotten by how this base game was.
[400:46.42]I said it before when we were finishing the first playthrough, but...
[400:51.80]How long did your first playthrough take?
[400:54.10]I know you may have skipped some optional stuff, but it took me more than 100 hours to just play through it normally.
[401:01.18]I think 120.
[401:01.70]Yeah.
[401:05.14]Every other FromSoftware game took me somewhere between 40 to 60 hours.
[401:11.04]I put my invitation down. 150?
[401:25.13]Took me 200 hours.
[401:25.67]50 hours, but I was Google Gaming.
[401:35.68]That's an interesting way to say it.
[401:36.84]Google Gaming.
[401:37.48]Maybe you just kind of followed a guide or something?
[401:42.11]Google Gaming.
[401:43.69]I like that.
[401:50.67]Actually, I should take this off.
[401:51.83]Okay.
[402:02.55]My load's a little too heavy.
[402:05.85]Maybe by a little.
[402:10.43]I'm a bit of a baby boy.
[402:19.12]Still medium, right?
[402:20.00]That's heavy.
[402:28.10]Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy.
[402:29.92]Medium...
[402:33.92]Eh, we'll just do it.
[402:35.54]Now I'm pretty cool looking.
[402:36.72]Alright, let's continue.
[402:42.29]Sorry.
[402:49.31]Dude, I have a headache from that green screen car game.
[402:51.88]From like a, like a, like five days ago?
[402:57.40]Hey, just because it was five days ago doesn't mean he watched it five days ago.
[403:02.88]Oh, that's right.
[403:06.19]Yeah, the game was out of control.
[403:13.43]Maybe he has had a headache for five days.
[403:16.38]That fucking card game.
[403:17.58]Oh no, it was bad.
[403:18.14]Am I going backwards?
[403:19.84]We need to go north through this tunnel.
[403:21.90]Right?
[403:23.50]Right?
[403:24.16]Mod chat?
[403:25.18]Mod helpers?
[403:29.76]No, this can't be backwards.
[403:31.48]Because we would have picked that up.
[403:44.04]that's Gary yeah we're this right that's Gary's castle whoa take this too this is another one of my favorite moves I'm just we're just getting all my favorite spells I was gonna say a second ago every single time you like find an item you're like uh you're either this is one of my favorite spells or uh isn't it oh hey wait guys isn't this one like one of the most strong ones in the game
[404:04.44]Like every weapon is the strongest weapon in the game.
[404:06.48]Pick this up.
[404:06.80]This thing is actually... I'm telling you, it's good.
[404:09.86]This is a joke item.
[404:11.48]It's not a joke item.
[404:12.68]I'm telling you right now.
[404:13.60]That is... I promise you.
[404:15.22]That's the... Thank you.
[404:18.11]Finally.
[404:18.65]This is one of my favorites in the game.
[404:22.09]I've just wanted like an actual sword sorcery.
[404:25.15]Like for the whole game.
[404:26.19]Dare you mock me in front of all of my viewers.
[404:34.34]They held me in such high regard before you opened your mouth.
[404:43.10]That was a kind of, I've never heard you do that voice before.
[404:45.18]I'm a bit of a psycho.
[404:53.46]Now here's the real question.
[404:54.36]Will the actual super ultra comet ability be on this guy?
[405:01.39]When we go do it over here.
[405:05.27]probably not um wait does that weapon count as an ice like a moon magic that is moon magic it does count um I should give this to you do you have that do you have the hat the hat oh no I don't well then take it he's Ster you're essentially gonna be playing the character I was playing as when I played through the game I'm gonna switch on I need to respec
[405:32.59]Let me get it.
[405:33.95]This thing boosts sorceries, right?
[405:37.61]Yeah, it does.
[405:41.95]You're slowly turning into the character.
[405:43.45]I did that ice glintstone and this moon sword essentially the entire game.
[405:48.29]I like hate this hat.
[405:50.69]Do you want to do more damage or do you want to complain about how it looks on you?
[405:56.75]I think I might complain.
[405:58.05]I really hate it.
[406:03.99]is it worth losing like how much percent like 10 15 more damage I think it might be more than that I look like a rug you can catch if it rains you'll be fine I hate this hat now this is the good hat
[406:29.73]How is that?
[406:30.43]Okay.
[406:31.23]You... It's the same hat, just different.
[406:34.41]It's very... It's the same but different.
[406:36.77]It's the same hat that they... That's in the same world of hats.
[406:41.40]That would be sold at the same store the other one was in.
[406:44.50]the the the profile the shape the actual shape like how tall and droopy and lame you can't even see your eyes are covered you're an anime character you don't actually need functionality this one you got a mask you have full clear vision it's definitely blocking your head from the sun and it doesn't go excessively high it's just just enough to cover your head same hat
[407:14.18]Oh, yeah?
[407:14.54]But does that one... Oh, hold on.
[407:17.67]Would that one make you punch the punch machine 15% harder and get an even higher score?
[407:24.47]You still don't want it?
[407:25.71]I don't need a higher score because I already had the highest score of everyone.
[407:29.50]What if somebody comes over and beats it?
[407:32.16]It ain't going to be you.
[407:34.52]You better shut your mouth.
[407:36.40]You don't know that.
[407:40.47]fucking looking at the game get them get them guys I was just like I was just seeing what was going on over here okay what do you what I don't what do you want me to do I had 25 000 ruins too here's what I want you to do I want you to just pick whatever you feel like playing within let's play I just want you to fucking die did you rest no
[408:08.66]Why don't you just fall over?
[408:10.86]You got killed by a snowman.
[408:13.13]It really is a snowman.
[408:26.49]There's a Magma Wyrm in the lava.
[408:29.16]There's a big lava pool somewhere where the manor is, right?
[408:33.14]I wonder what's over there this time.
[408:36.64]Oh, lava and more lava.
[408:40.16]This guy's really fucking pissing me off right now.
[408:55.74]That's a fake dragon.
[408:57.94]That is a fake dragon.
[409:01.48]Okay.
[409:02.42]So we need to hug the left wall.
[409:04.20]So we gotta go this way.
[409:05.38]That's what I was told specifically by me.
[409:08.16]Because I figured it out.
[409:11.26]Nick, good job on figuring this out.
[409:17.09]You have no right to talk shit about people's hats when you're wearing a cereal bowl on your head.
[409:27.07]I like all these hats.
[409:28.65]I'm saying they're all cool.
[409:31.43]Yeah, I was the one saying I didn't like a hat.
[409:36.89]What's over here?
[409:37.37]Because there's a boss over here.
[409:38.71]Oh, it's a boat.
[409:39.63]Nice.
[409:45.56]That's going to be interesting.
[409:47.14]Yeah, he's got a fucking lava boat.
[409:50.22]How long can the horse be in here?
[409:53.16]Actually, kind of a decent amount of time.
[409:56.76]Yeah, lava does very little damage in this game.
[410:00.77]Oh God, that's a lot of guys.
[410:14.72]Smithing Stone five.
[410:20.50]Can we like convince him to move over here or something?
[410:23.77]He wasn't moving.
[410:26.90]Try and convince him as you might.
[410:28.74]As you may.
[410:29.35]Just stand over here.
[410:30.05]He'll probably slowly row over.
[410:32.67]Here he comes.
[410:34.79]Look at the wheelchair.
[410:39.19]We're trying to trick him.
[410:41.63]You can't row over here.
[410:42.91]This is land.
[410:46.24]What did you boys want me to do over here?
[410:48.42]Ow!
[410:48.66]Ow!
[410:49.02]Ow!
[411:20.41]What are you doing over here?
[411:21.41]Don't splash me.
[411:28.98]Don't splash me.
[411:31.77]He's going back in the fucking lava.
[411:56.64]I was actually respecting the lava on the ground and trying to not walk into it again.
[412:00.40]Oh, really?
[412:01.06]Sorry.
[412:01.28]I was like, oh, yeah.
[412:02.36]Lava on the brain.
[412:06.36]That's my gamer brain.
[412:07.76]My sleepy gamer brain.
[412:12.59]Alexander is over there usually, right?
[412:14.07]At this point in the game.
[412:15.13]But we didn't do any of his quest.
[412:16.35]I don't know.
[412:20.01]What is this area?
[412:20.75]Never heard of it.
[412:25.65]Is this Elden Ring?
[412:27.67]Would Alexander still be here?
[412:30.81]No, I don't.
[412:31.27]I think we actually have to do is see him before this.
[412:38.02]I think that was the Smithing Stone.
[412:39.18]I need it.
[412:40.24]I'm going to eat one of these for the first time I think ever in the hundreds of hours I've played this game.
[412:46.32]The Roa?
[412:47.12]Yeah.
[412:47.66]The fruit.
[412:48.90]Where is it?
[412:49.32]I don't even know what it looks like.
[412:53.96]Okay, here it is.
[412:55.14]Wait.
[412:57.25]What's the thing that you feed to the horse?
[412:59.57]Roa Berry.
[413:03.59]You have to craft it.
[413:04.63]Oh shit.
[413:05.25]Okay.
[413:06.13]Oh yeah.
[413:06.49]You do have to craft it from those berries.
[413:17.84]Make it.
[413:18.72]Oh, I was actually so nervous to hear that loud sound.
[413:33.48]How do you feel about the crafting in this game?
[413:34.88]I feel like it did not need to be in the game.
[413:38.50]I feel like it is... I don't think it matters at all.
[413:46.80]It's upgrade time for me.
[413:48.95]I believe it is for me too.
[413:52.11]Let's get a bonfire and go upgrade time.
[413:54.81]It's a really interesting mechanic to put in, and it's just more shit to do.
[413:59.59]It's just more fun stuff to do, but I don't really use it.
[414:05.04]Some of the pot stuff is cool.
[414:06.84]Oh, craft this.
[414:07.88]Craft some of the grease and stuff, right?
[414:09.92]But for the most part, I left it completely alone.
[414:14.18]I really feel like they're only useful in the areas where it's like, this enemy insta-dies if you throw this type of pot at it.
[414:20.87]Yeah.
[414:23.71]that's a great talisman for here yeah early on I tried to do like a bow playthrough and I got a whole bunch of poison arrows I spent like 20 000 soulslike early in the game to get a bunch of poison arrows and I used 80 of them to kill like one mini boss so that's how I feel
[414:53.25]FromSoftware really has had sort of a weird relationship with bows and all their games, haven't they?
[414:58.63]They seem to want to make them cool and make them work, but it always seems that they're just not quite good enough.
[415:06.20]They need to commit to like a mana system instead of actually having to be consumables.
[415:14.42]Because otherwise you could you could have anywhere between one and like 9000 arrows to use where magic is like limited.
[415:26.98]It does work as a kind of a secondary, though, if you if you're already doing decks and oh, I'm going to do like a bow, a short bow with my offhand or something.
[415:36.58]You can use it.
[415:38.23]But not as like a main weapon to play through the game with and like, I'm going to use this and this is the weapon I'm using.
[415:44.07]But it's weird.
[415:44.89]They put like every game they put a little bit more development into what bows are like.
[415:49.53]There's like Radon has like a great bow that has like a special bow effects in it and they're all just super bad.
[416:00.31]The Greatbows were actually kind of good in this game just for like knocking things down.
[416:06.55]Owie!
[416:08.55]You can still make it work though if you really wanted to.
[416:10.55]They even added all the animations and the weapon arts and stuff, right?
[416:17.66]Yep.
[416:18.68]So, I mean, it's cool.
[416:21.02]It's a cool thing.
[416:21.92]Oh my goodness.
[416:30.75]sky is just flailing around uh do we miss a Grace I don't think so I think it's if we just ran further I think there is a boss usually on this road the um the giant putrid slob would be up here that is actually a great name for a boss I'm about to respawn everything
[416:55.90]The Great Putrid... I don't know.
[417:01.42]The Giant... The Great Putrid Slob.
[417:04.04]You know.
[417:05.22]What did I say?
[417:05.88]The Great Putrid Slob.
[417:07.62]That's a great name.
[417:16.37]Demi-human Queen Erdtree, the Great Putrid Slob.
[417:21.89]And his crab friend.
[417:27.57]Are you up here?
[417:28.71]I leveled up.
[417:30.53]What?
[417:32.93]I literally went to go level up.
[417:34.45]I have 50,000 souls, man.
[417:35.57]I don't want to die here.
[417:37.24]You think I'm going to... I got 50,000 souls.
[417:39.68]I need an update on what you're doing.
[417:41.66]Yeah, you think we're going to take on the great putrid slob without me leveling up once?
[417:46.78]What if I die?
[417:50.47]Look at all this bullshit here.
[417:53.93]Look at all this.
[417:54.61]This is a fucking mess.
[417:57.13]Eat.
[417:59.15]Oh my God, come on.
[418:01.03]Yeah, having fun fighting it alone.
[418:05.01]I mean, I got squished in between everything, but... Did you leave?
[418:09.86]I was fighting stuff up on the hill.
[418:14.58]I just wanted to just do the big explosion and get it on camera.
[418:23.41]I'm not sitting down.
[418:29.61]the great putrid slob also known as the Dung Eater
[419:00.60]Use your pistol.
[419:02.38]What?
[419:05.14]Were you just like super excited that you found like an M16 or something?
[419:11.14]Swear.
[419:18.16]Why is he following me around this house?
[419:38.67]The word slob is... That's actually one of my favorite words, I think, in the dictionary.
[419:42.95]Oh, you fucking slob.
[419:49.29]It has so much meaning.
[419:50.57]It's like so much force behind it.
[420:00.41]if somebody calls you a slob it's like hey whoa dude what the fuck come on like what do you mean I'm a slob I don't know I feel like someone calls you a slob it's like hey you got me there to me that's like there's something I gotta figure out why you just called me that like something disgusting is around me something is gross
[420:23.11]Like, I am disgusting you somehow for you to use the term slob.
[420:27.91]Well, yeah, that's why you're the great grotesque slob.
[420:36.57]Like, if you had like a dirty room or something, somebody came in and was like, hey, clean your room, you fucking slob.
[420:41.79]It's like, ow.
[420:45.13]It's a power word.
[420:46.07]That's, hey.
[420:47.33]Okay.
[420:53.46]Come talk.
[420:54.54]Come talk over here.
[420:55.94]Let's see what you get.
[420:59.22]What the fuck is this?
[421:05.31]I swear I played a lot of this game.
[421:08.85]It won't talk.
[421:09.87]What?
[421:10.47]Talk.
[421:12.15]Wait.
[421:12.97]You have to bring something here.
[421:14.55]I got an item.
[421:15.65]What'd you get?
[421:16.73]I got a stone sword key.
[421:18.79]That's not what you get.
[421:19.65]Is this like a rock normally?
[421:21.47]This is where you get comet azure.
[421:24.16]That like... The kamehameha thing you wanted.
[421:27.94]This is where you get azure.
[421:30.73]But that's not what you get.
[421:34.78]Okay, maybe it's just because it's dressed like a fucking wizard that I don't remember it.
[421:39.20]That's what it looks like in the game.
[421:41.36]In the regular game.
[421:42.70]Is it?
[421:43.14]Yeah.
[421:44.78]I don't believe you.
[421:45.90]That is what it looks like in the game.
[421:47.84]That is the character.
[421:48.54]I don't believe you.
[421:50.48]That's fine.
[421:51.36]You'll see it whenever you play through this game for some reason.
[421:57.31]Like right now.
[421:58.13]Well, it is a wizard.
[421:59.03]This is a wizard.
[421:59.89]Can we go to the road of the manor?
[422:02.37]If you ask nicely.
[422:04.83]Can I please go to the road of the manor?
[422:07.29]And upgrade my weapon?
[422:08.22]Yes.
[422:11.90]No vote in progress.
[422:14.46]It just failed.
[422:16.22]It was an epic fail.
[422:26.76]I'm going to throw you a curveball here.
[422:29.37]I catch it you're out I'm uh I'm getting kind of hungry and I think I think I'm getting close to being wanting to probably end stream um I'm content with your words that you're saying I'm content how do you how do you feel about um oh no I need sevens not sixes god damn it let's do this do our upgrades seven
[422:59.20]I might.
[422:59.54]Let's go find out.
[423:01.54]Wait, did we go to the... No, he's behind us.
[423:05.48]I've played this game before too, I promise.
[423:08.54]Uh, what do you need?
[423:10.30]Smithing Stone 7 Unnormal.
[423:12.04]I think I've asked you this like six times.
[423:14.03]Yeah.
[423:15.29]No, I don't.
[423:15.89]Alright, so yeah, but you keep asking me this question, but I can't be like stupid and follow you and hit the same wall that you did.
[423:25.43]No, you can be stupid.
[423:27.35]Alright, I'm about to be really powerful.
[423:33.42]see oh man I need I need some souls this this really is like a randomizer experience I have a Smithing Stone two three four five six seven eight and an ancient Smithing Stone I just I I just don't have seven I know I said that I had seven but you're not listening to me anyway no no I I hear you I it is a it is a randomizer experience and it is very strange and need to pay attention to lots of weird things going on
[423:58.91]Okay, so we're done.
[424:01.45]Not yet.
[424:02.13]I want to upgrade this.
[424:05.34]Okay, so I'm done.
[424:07.70]I think we can separate worlds.
[424:10.48]Because I think... We're separating.
[424:12.88]We can separate worlds.
[424:17.80]We didn't even do our... We didn't even do our stand next to each other, unequip our swords, and do a wave.
[424:23.69]Idiot.
[424:25.21]You're the idiot.
[424:26.07]You're the one that said that we're done.
[424:30.57]idiot alright it's there's been a lot of fun yeah the last couple days have been really really fun uh look forward to more so we'll see you as next next weekend Saturday Sunday Elden Ring randomizers till we beat the game I think we'll do it in the next two I I think we'll do it this coming weekend I think we're gonna beat it this coming weekend I do I think if we actually just fought final bosses we could do it in like a day
[425:00.77]I don't think we need to rush that fast.
[425:02.55]I don't want to rush.
[425:03.49]I'm saying it just depends how much side content we do because there's a million of it.
[425:07.71]I think for the next stream, I might also actually do the Faith respec.
[425:12.09]We'll see.
[425:13.85]Yeah, we will see.
[425:15.31]We will see.
[425:15.67]I'm going to have to sleep on it.
[425:16.67]I'm going to have to really deeply consider.
[425:19.08]Take it easy, Stirp.
[425:19.84]Good to see you again.
[425:22.02]It's been a lot of fun.
[425:22.80]Seriously.
[425:23.88]Talk to you soon, man.
[425:25.00]Yeah, see you.
[425:25.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[425:27.12]Uh-huh.
[425:29.57]Why am I getting in?
[425:34.12]Wait, I didn't do this in my world.
[425:35.58]Oh, right.
[425:43.23]Okay.
[425:44.43]Let me sell some stuff.
[425:58.84]And we will go from there.
[426:03.75]Uh, so, alright.
[426:10.27]Who cares about these rune arcs?
[426:12.07]We're not going to get the runes anyways, so who cares?
[426:13.82]Ooh.
[426:25.00]Never going to use these.
[426:30.00]I'm never going to use this.
[426:32.80]That thing is cool.
[426:37.36]What the hell am I never going to use?
[426:39.92]Never going to use this.
[426:42.94]I'm just not going to.
[426:43.79]Just be honest.
[426:44.83]I'm probably never going to use any of this stuff.
[426:46.05]I could sell everything here.
[426:49.47]Okay, here we go.
[426:53.47]Plus seven.
[426:56.43]This thing is very dangerous now.
[427:00.53]Awesome.
[427:02.11]B. It goes to B. Wait, it scales B and B?
[427:05.30]Faith and strength?
[427:06.08]I didn't know that.
[427:07.86]So I should now, because I have 40... I should be... I should be putting all my points into faith now.
[427:15.16]Because it'll scale double, right?
[427:21.01]So that's gonna be cool.
[427:22.75]I didn't know that it did that.
[427:23.49]That's huge scaling on both.
[427:30.44]Yeah, but that's going to be it.
[427:32.98]It's been a lot of fun.
[427:34.82]Elden Ring, I'm just glad to be playing it again, to be honest.
[427:37.33]That's all there is to it, right?
[427:43.11]I will see you guys.
[427:44.39]Next time I see you, I've got some stuff I need to do over the next few days.
[427:48.41]We'll probably do the same thing we did this week, which is probably like a Thursday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday scenario.
[427:57.10]I think that worked out pretty well.
[428:00.18]That's what we'll do.
[428:02.80]But that's it.

[428:21.66]That's a good question.
[428:22.58]We will figure that out over the next few days.
[428:27.68]Hope you had fun.
[428:30.85]Get some sleep.
[428:31.37]I know some of you were up late last night.
[428:37.39]And probably pretty late for some of you right now too.
[428:42.35]Have a good rest of your weekend.
[428:43.39]Although there's not much left of it.
[428:47.87]But I'll see you later.
[428:50.71]I need to exit the game.
