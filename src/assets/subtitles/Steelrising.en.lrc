[00:03.08]What's up?
[00:12.13]Didn't expect me today, did you?
[00:15.55]Hey, just like I can delay streams indefinitely, I can also pull them back.
[00:23.37]That's exactly what we're doing.
[00:27.95]We'll stream tomorrow, but maybe we can go over a few things.
[00:31.42]Reverse delay, yeah.
[00:34.19]It happens like once a year.
[00:35.53]Well, you're here for it.
[00:41.34]You're here for it.
[00:44.04]The one time every year that I, instead of pushing a stream out, I do it a day or two before.
[00:52.49]And it's funny because this is a mistake on my part.
[01:00.90]But I so I come I come in a free stream chat.
[01:05.54]And people just kind of like, what do you?
[01:08.30]Hey, what's up, man?
[01:08.86]What are you doing here?
[01:10.12]Just like, what do you mean?
[01:11.04]Like, let's get ready.
[01:13.16]Are we like 330?
[01:13.66]I thought it was Tuesday.
[01:20.34]And I'm just going to go by what I think in my head.
[01:23.10]So I'm not just going to get here and be ready.
[01:25.56]Sitting at the desk.
[01:26.38]It's like, okay, here we go.
[01:28.56]It's time to stream.
[01:30.06]And then, no, no, never mind.
[01:32.02]I'm coming.
[01:32.36]But no, I'm here.
[01:33.16]I'm ready.
[01:34.08]So we're streaming today.
[01:36.82]We also are going to play Such Art.
[01:38.99]Which... I don't know.
[01:41.15]I saw this came out.
[01:41.97]This Steel Rising.
[01:43.85]Like a Dark Souls-like...
[01:46.77]We can hear the game when you talk again.
[01:48.47]What the fuck, man?
[01:49.71]Why is it so hard to stream?
[01:52.97]Why does it never... Why do my settings get reversed every time I turn on my computer?
[02:00.45]I'm being serious.
[02:05.31]Why... Is it fixed?
[02:08.59]Why do my settings reverse every time I turn my computer on?
[02:13.27]What the fuck is this doing?
[02:14.57]Oh, God.
[02:15.37]Come on.
[02:19.27]Okay, anyways.
[02:20.81]Yeah, alright, so let's go over a few things.
[02:22.85]Let's talk about the week ahead here.
[02:26.67]Because there's a few things we need to discuss.
[02:29.21]Very important.
[02:32.57]I think it's fixed, yeah.
[02:34.34]Alright, so here's the deal.
[02:36.26]So, what we're going to do this weekend... Oh my, stop, hold on.
[02:42.10]This weekend, we're going to do an Omega weekend.
[02:45.44]Okay?
[02:46.08]Okay.
[02:48.84]I'm streaming today.
[02:49.92]We'll go for about five to seven hours, depending how long it takes.
[02:52.60]Depending what we do.
[02:56.21]But there's something that I have to do.
[02:59.27]There's something that I've been kind of figuring out the last day or so.
[03:02.03]It's why I didn't stream yesterday.
[03:05.84]I have to get a thousand fucking baseballs signed and shipped.
[03:13.22]Because there's a lot of them.
[03:17.20]So, I have to get that going.
[03:25.31]Once for me.
[03:26.31]That's right.
[03:26.75]You should do it on stream.
[03:31.77]No, I don't want to do that.
[03:33.25]That's weird.
[03:34.87]That's weird to me.
[03:36.03]I don't like that at all.
[03:39.15]I want to just sit there with a YouTube playlist up for like two, two like eight hour days back to back.
[03:49.10]just put on um you know what I've been really into um this this chemist on youtube I have no idea what the hell he's talking about but all his videos they're like 30 plus minute long videos and it just it just talks about all this chemistry nile red yeah that's the one so I just watch nile red and I just I here's the thing what happens when you watch a nile red video
[04:11.75]By the time you get to the end of the video and the experiment is over, I forgot the whole video.
[04:18.08]I don't even know what happened.
[04:22.88]They're awesome though.
[04:23.58]They are the best videos just to sit there with your mouth open and just go, wow, I'm learning.
[04:30.95]I have no idea what I'm learning.
[04:40.64]Stream that.
[04:44.60]Wait, stream watching Nile Red videos?
[04:47.70]I don't know about that.
[04:49.44]I'd rather you watch Nile Red videos on Nile Red's channel.
[04:52.32]I don't, I mean, we could.
[04:55.34]Alright, but I want to do that while I'm signing baseballs.
[05:03.08]Do you really want me to stream this?
[05:05.16]No, no, no.
[05:05.84]I don't think so.
[05:06.74]That's weird to me.
[05:08.27]To me, that's like... I don't know.
[05:10.17]That feels like an egomaniac stream.
[05:11.85]I don't know why.
[05:12.49]It just does.
[05:12.93]That feels kind of like an egomaniac thing.
[05:15.53]Oh, hey.
[05:15.67]What's up, guys?
[05:16.79]Signing baseballs.
[05:17.67]Yeah.
[05:17.95]I'm going to sign this one, too.
[05:19.41]Oh, give me that one.
[05:20.13]Yeah.
[05:20.27]I'm going to sign that one.
[05:21.33]That's my name on it, by the way.
[05:23.71]I don't know.
[05:27.25]Maybe.
[05:28.83]I will give you a hard maybe on that one.
[05:32.57]But...
[05:35.09]I do.
[05:35.39]I have to get that sorted.
[05:36.45]I got to get shipments.
[05:37.59]I got to get it's a thousand baseballs.
[05:39.55]It's a lot of material.
[05:40.55]It's a ton to work with.
[05:42.32]So my plan is this.
[05:43.60]I'm going to stream today.
[05:46.72]And then unless I decide to do an egomaniac megalomania stream.
[05:54.32]next time you see me after tonight will be for the omega weekend on Friday Saturday and Sunday we're gonna do three days in a row I know I've been kind of bouncing around a lot lately I've been you know it's been like three days no stream four days five days no stream we're gonna do an omega weekend this weekend so get your recommendations in to the Discord channel because that's gonna those are gonna be a doozy of three days in a row
[06:19.36]I promise this is not going to be like, well, this stream's like four hours and 16 minutes.
[06:25.47]No, we're going to do three Omega streams in a row.
[06:27.95]We're doing an Omega weekend.
[06:29.15]And I'm going to laugh my ass off if I get like a headache on Friday afternoon.
[06:33.17]But that's the plan.
[06:36.01]Guys, we can't do the Omega weekend.
[06:38.70]I need a nap.
[06:40.90]I won't.
[06:44.42]Don't burn out.
[06:45.20]No, I've been taking a lot of time.
[06:47.26]So don't worry.
[06:47.68]I'll be okay.
[06:48.98]It'll be fun.
[06:49.62]We'll get a bunch of stuff to do.
[06:50.62]You're going to call into sick for work.
[07:00.59]No, I'm not going to.
[07:01.67]I promise.
[07:02.75]We'll do a bunch of stuff.
[07:03.95]We'll play like 10 different games.
[07:05.53]We'll jump around.
[07:06.14]We'll be crazy.
[07:08.75]But today, we're going to play this Dark Souls... I stopped saying that because I feel like companies hate to hear that.
[07:16.94]Hey guys, we're going to play this thing and the only thing that I'm going to tell you is Dark Souls is awesome.
[07:22.60]Okay, I'm sure that it's like, yeah.
[07:27.10]Hey dude, Dark Souls is an awesome game.
[07:28.66]Let's play this one.
[07:29.20]It's called Steel Rising.
[07:31.76]I have no idea.
[07:32.76]We're going to give it a try.
[07:35.48]You guys ready?
[07:36.96]Change the title.
[07:39.98]I like that title.
[07:41.54]It's because everybody calls everything like a Souls-esque, Souls-lite, Souls-like, Souls-esque, Souls-lite-like.
[07:50.88]I think my title is fine.
[07:57.97]Dude, I should just start calling this stream a rogue-lite stream because it turns off when we start over again with like a new game on another stream later.
[08:06.09]It's kind of like a rogue-like, you know?
[08:07.45]We start over on a different game each stream.
[08:11.63]Alright, let me get this, I think unplugged here.
[08:17.94]I hope this is good.
[08:18.56]Alright, can you guys, you guys can't see, this is way too loud for me.
[08:23.36]It probably won't be too loud for you though.
[08:25.76]And I can confirm.
[08:28.04]Yes, we've confirmed it.
[08:31.62]I've confirmed it with you.
[08:34.35]We are with a new camera angle.
[08:37.79]I have moved it to where I want it permanently.
[08:41.80]Do you understand where this is now?
[08:43.36]This is a perfect angle.
[08:45.86]Perfect angle.
[08:46.82]Perfect lighting.
[08:47.42]What do you think?
[08:54.85]This is better, right?
[08:56.13]You're right there.
[08:56.81]You're literally right there.
[08:57.61]Exactly where I wanted you.
[09:01.87]It's too orange.
[09:03.17]That's my face.
[09:04.43]Alright, you guys ready for this?
[09:12.04]I'm ready.
[09:12.72]I'm ready.
[09:12.98]This is called Steel Rising.
[09:15.62]Why did I laugh?
[09:16.70]God damn it.
[09:17.20]I can't.
[09:18.13]Why am I even live?
[09:18.93]Okay.
[09:22.81]Why is this funny?
[09:24.73]This isn't funny.
[09:25.91]Nothing that I'm doing is funny.
[09:27.91]I don't understand.
[09:28.65]Why am I laughing at this?
[09:30.55]What the fuck is going on?
[09:31.95]I'm sorry.
[09:33.57]What's assist mode?
[09:38.88]Okay.
[09:39.10]Okay.
[09:42.27]So this makes it easier.
[09:43.45]Okay, well, I'm not going to need that for now.
[09:48.05]Maybe I'll need it later.
[09:49.39]We'll see.
[09:49.73]Alright, here comes the opening cutscene.
[09:53.01]Everybody's quiet.
[09:59.47]Where's Otto?
[09:59.93]I'll show him in a little bit.
[10:00.68]I told you later.
[10:01.02]I told you later.
[10:14.15]Oh, pardon.
[10:15.11]Checkmate.
[10:16.77]You know, actually, I think I'm in no mood for games right now.
[10:22.79]How much longer are we to be kept here?
[10:24.19]Or we just simply watch as Paris burns from afar?
[10:29.55]The rabble are rioting.
[10:31.57]This is the price to be paid for spoiling the masses.
[10:34.67]Why are they always playing chess?
[10:37.15]The king sent us here long before the city went up in flames.
[10:40.45]He knew what was about to transpire.
[10:43.39]If you're a noble, do you have to know chess?
[10:45.49]What if you don't?
[10:47.22]Does that annoy the other nobles?
[10:48.40]The children...
[11:05.13]They'll soon be out of harm's way.
[11:06.87]I am most certain of it.
[11:08.57]Monsieur Clary will take good care of them.
[11:11.44]For now, at least we are safe.
[11:13.74]Louder.
[11:14.74]Safe?
[11:15.20]Vraemon?
[11:16.58]Where are the chateau guards?
[11:18.38]We are still protected.
[11:20.34]The king just preferred to use a different sort of guard.
[11:24.29]R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[11:29.67]Guards?
[11:30.57]Or jailers?
[11:31.87]They won't even let us leave this room, Gabrielle.
[11:37.18]The king, he has lost his mind to grief.
[11:41.06]First our darling Sophie, then our beloved son.
[11:46.97]My poor sweet angel.
[11:49.99]They didn't let me say goodbye.
[11:52.38]What character am I?
[11:57.80]Something inside me is crying out.
[12:01.22]Telling me he's still of this world at times.
[12:04.12]I think I hear him calling to me.
[12:05.54]I'm so afraid.
[12:06.78]What do you fear, my queen?
[12:08.70]Everything.
[12:09.68]Everything horrifies me.
[12:13.39]The king's wrath.
[12:14.95]His army of indefatigable automats that Monsieur de Vaucanson has built for him.
[12:20.37]The charlatans who are now more powerful ministers.
[12:26.26]What happened to my son?
[12:28.98]What will happen to the children that God has deigned to leave in my care?
[12:32.46]I won't let any harm come to them.
[12:35.19]This I promise you.
[12:36.67]But how?
[12:36.93]Do you not see that we're prisoners here?
[12:43.98]Me.
[12:44.06]Okay.
[12:44.22]Wait, are we a robot?
[12:45.30]We're a robot.
[12:45.76]Yep.
[13:17.81]I don't know.
[13:20.39]I think it has to be this.
[13:21.85]It has to be, right?
[13:23.95]We have to do the George Washington here.
[13:25.43]Okay, I like this one.
[13:40.50]Okay, what's next?
[13:43.06]Wait, do you have to pick a class?
[13:46.50]Bodyguard, Soldier, Dancer.
[13:49.38]This is going to be hard mode or something, right?
[13:52.68]Don't ever pick this first in a Souls-like-esque-like, roguelike-esque-like game, right?
[13:59.03]You always do this first.
[14:01.97]Wait, let me read.
[14:03.81]Heavy weapon, special move, block.
[14:06.98]Ranged attack, heavy weapon.
[14:08.58]Heavy weapon, heavy weapon, light weapon, light weapon.
[14:11.06]Alright.
[14:12.74]What do all the streamers do?
[14:13.74]Because I don't want to do that one.
[14:18.99]Dancer?
[14:19.81]What do all the streamers do?
[14:21.51]I don't want to do the streamer one.
[14:26.10]Nobody plays this.
[14:27.66]Dancer or the game?
[14:32.08]Dancer?
[14:32.62]Wait.
[14:33.38]Light weapon, block, explosive projectile that can ignite an enemy.
[14:37.33]Wait, I have like a fan?
[14:38.31]Is it a shield?
[14:39.21]What is it?
[14:40.53]Dancers are highly resistant and can chain attacks together in quick succession to immobilize enemies and inflict critical hits.
[14:48.56]Okay.
[14:48.92]Is this like Dex?
[14:54.19]Light weapon.
[14:54.79]Weapon is infused with frost.
[14:56.29]No.
[14:56.57]Alright.
[14:56.99]I'll do Dancer.
[14:57.59]What if I suck?
[14:59.47]Fine.
[14:59.69]Alright.
[14:59.97]What about details?
[15:00.53]Ah, there we go.
[15:02.05]Alright.
[15:03.27]So this is... Alright.
[15:04.07]This is durability.
[15:04.81]This is tank.
[15:05.67]This is strength.
[15:07.01]Heavy weapons.
[15:07.67]This is Dex.
[15:09.33]And this is magic.
[15:12.16]Alright.
[15:12.36]We'll do Dancer.
[15:21.72]I am master of magic.
[15:23.46]That's going to be the most minus twos of the whole year, without a doubt.
[15:28.24]Oh, nobody cared.
[15:29.98]Never mind.
[15:33.75]Why are they standing like that?
[15:35.89]That's what I do when I have a wicked bad burp.
[15:50.92]That has not come out yet.
[15:51.94]What is that stance?
[15:52.76]That's like that acid reflux pose.
[15:54.94]Like the... That's me.
[15:55.58]This game sucked.
[16:19.14]Go and find Vaucanson at his workshop.
[16:21.99]Ni les Invalides.
[16:23.45]He surely holds the secret to these tireless automats.
[16:28.47]And perhaps he will know something about the death of my son.
[16:33.85]How am I to leave the chateau grounds, madame?
[16:36.49]Okay.
[16:37.53]Go to the riverbank at the far side of the grounds.
[16:41.41]From there you can take a boat to Paris.
[16:43.05]Go that way and take a boat.
[16:45.70]And now we open up the doors to the first area of our Souls-esque, Souls-lite game.
[16:52.17]And we get to hear it.
[16:53.39]We get to hear this.
[16:54.21]I can't fucking wait.
[17:10.33]Eh, nevermind.
[17:11.05]Alright, so how do we play?
[17:12.29]How do I play?
[17:13.37]Reach the... Investigate the... Alright.
[17:16.14]How do you play?
[17:17.52]There's a... Alright, that's... My eyes hurt.
[17:21.38]That's a huge... That's like a frog jump.
[17:23.69]Alright.
[17:27.35]Is it dodge?
[17:29.29]Alright, let's do... Let's dance!
[17:36.97]Okay.
[17:38.87]That's a charge.
[17:39.47]It's like fans.
[17:40.59]Alright, cool.
[17:41.07]So I can lock on.
[17:43.48]Excuse me?
[17:48.68]Okay.
[17:49.48]Quick access belt.
[17:52.04]How come you look 40 from this angle?
[17:53.90]Ban that person.
[17:55.52]Alright.
[17:56.22]Consumables on the quick access belt so you can use them at any time.
[17:58.72]Go to the inventory to assign oil burrit to the belt.
[18:05.31]Okay.
[18:06.59]This is a heal.
[18:07.15]It's like an oil can.
[18:08.97]Really?
[18:09.25]So you're like... Alright, I like that.
[18:16.96]So let's put it on this slot right here.
[18:18.96]Okay.
[18:22.90]Well, actually, why would I have that equipped?
[18:29.30]I guess that's just repair.
[18:30.49]That's kind of cool looking.
[18:33.19]There's one thing that I... Ooh, hold on.
[18:38.17]I'm very curious if I can do this or not.
[18:41.50]I saw it in the options menu.
[18:42.74]Let's just go to the video.
[18:45.98]Field of view.
[18:47.87]What does that do?
[18:54.44]100 times.
[18:55.16]A million times better.
[18:57.38]I'm gonna say 100 fucking million times better.
[18:59.60]You don't understand?
[19:00.92]A million times better.
[19:02.06]Okay, hold on.
[19:07.59]There was something else I might want to do, too.
[19:12.69]Advanced video.
[19:14.81]If it's in here, I'm gonna be really happy.
[19:16.15]Okay.
[19:19.15]That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.
[19:21.17]Ray tracing, mm-mm.
[19:24.26]I don't see it.
[19:26.46]Wait, game?
[19:28.03]Subtitles?
[19:29.39]Camera effects?
[19:31.69]No.
[19:31.95]Alright, let's go.
[19:43.49]Oh, you can grab?
[19:45.15]Try explore?
[19:45.77]Does it get a full letter grade?
[19:47.89]We'll find out in a second.
[19:50.42]Is there a sprint?
[19:52.10]I don't think this is a sprint.
[19:54.37]It might be.
[19:55.35]It's a very pretty game.
[19:57.17]If that matters to anybody here.
[19:59.83]Alright, each weapon has an attacking or de- Special move for the- Okay, so it's like a weapon art.
[20:05.90]I know, it's not- Yeah, whatever.
[20:09.04]What did that do?
[20:10.54]Oh, it's just a block.
[20:12.94]Okay.
[20:13.12]Okay.
[20:19.62]Uh, by the way, yes, uh, it did get rid of the screen shake, I believe.
[20:23.50]So, that's a full letter grade.
[20:25.28]Alright, hold on, wait.
[20:26.40]You can overheat?
[20:31.72]When Aegis runs out of endurance, her gears overheat and she can no longer perform the following actions.
[20:37.28]Attack, jump, dodge, or sprint.
[20:39.24]What?
[20:41.84]That's not good.
[20:45.33]When you're overheated, you can trigger rapid cooling, which can instantly restore an amount of endurance depending on your timing.
[20:51.25]However, this inflicts a certain amount of frost damage as shown in the following gauge.
[20:57.78]Wait, did he play this before?
[20:59.12]No, that's The Surge.
[20:59.80]It's one of my least favorite games of all time.
[21:03.34]Using it too soon, I have to over... Okay.
[21:05.20]So I gotta be careful.
[21:10.53]So over... Let me try this.
[21:12.69]Oops.
[21:16.42]So if I overheat... Okay, I overheated.
[21:20.74]You have to do it immediately.
[21:23.12]Alright, that's kind of insane.
[21:24.72]I'm kidding.
[21:25.38]That game is fine.
[21:26.64]I just didn't like it.
[21:29.16]I know that game was very cool.
[21:32.26]I didn't like it.
[21:33.14]Whatever.
[21:33.70]I don't need to explain myself.
[21:34.90]I didn't like it.
[21:35.92]I didn't like it!
[21:36.86]So get out of here!
[21:37.96]Leave me alone!
[21:48.02]I wonder, is there... There are no iframes.
[21:50.74]Wait, are there iframes?
[21:51.92]Let's test.
[21:53.18]No, there isn't.
[21:54.70]Wait, let's try it.
[21:56.32]Okay, maybe there is.
[21:56.92]I don't have any heals left.
[22:14.86]Now, you know, it was the Surge 2 that I never played.
[22:16.97]The Surge 1, I actually enjoyed up to the first hour.
[22:20.75]Then I backtracked a statement that I made in front of about 12,000 people to make sure that nobody hates me for having a video game that I don't like or something.
[22:28.89]So I backtracked.
[22:30.11]And, you know, honestly, like, if you like what you like, who cares?
[22:33.79]Enjoy what you enjoy.
[22:34.65]Don't let some dickhead like me tell you that you can't like something because I didn't.
[22:38.45]That's stupid.
[22:39.07]That's a dumb mindset.
[22:40.53]And nobody should have it.
[22:43.66]I'm going to die.
[22:51.35]Okay.
[22:55.01]H's light weapons are able to inflict immobilization damage as shown in the immobilization gauge.
[22:59.81]When the gauge is filled, the enemy is temporarily immobilized, leaving them open to a critical hit.
[23:03.76]Okay.
[23:05.92]So immobilization damage.
[23:07.62]Did it work?
[23:09.60]Is that a crit?
[23:12.62]I don't know.
[23:12.96]Okay, cool.
[23:20.26]Ignore the fact that you're insulting.
[23:22.92]No, that clip that was cycling around was a joke.
[23:26.83]You clipping it out of context.
[23:28.55]I said it and it was a comedic reference.
[23:32.09]It was a joke.
[23:32.81]I didn't actually mean it.
[23:33.87]Right afterwards, I go, no, no, I'm just kidding.
[23:39.37]I need to heal.
[23:44.74]Is there... Oh, there's a sprint.
[23:45.66]Okay, cool.
[23:47.78]Nice PR, Andy.
[23:49.84]No, I genuinely look if you like stuff.
[23:51.84]Who cares if I don't?
[23:52.57]If other people don't like it, do you like it?
[23:56.65]Who cares?
[23:57.81]Enjoy it.
[23:58.67]I like the venom movie.
[24:01.31]You throw fucking eggs at me.
[24:02.29]Alright, well that obviously can't go in there, so I'm almost dead though.
[24:09.81]What happens when I die?
[24:24.14]Cool.
[24:27.10]Frosty Key.
[24:28.66]Wait.
[24:29.68]Secrets.
[24:33.16]When did this game come out?
[24:37.86]Essence of Spirit?
[24:41.46]I'm livid that you don't share my opinion.
[24:49.16]Came out four days ago.
[24:50.74]Oh shit, I'm right on time.
[24:52.62]I'm never on time for this.
[24:56.16]I never play a new game when it comes out.
[24:58.38]I feel kind of accomplished in some way.
[25:12.83]What if I get heals?
[25:16.39]Are there crabs in the game?
[25:18.80]Who knows?
[25:19.22]We'll find out.
[25:20.64]The first boss is definitely going to be... Ooh, okay.
[25:22.36]Break stuff.
[25:25.12]Ordinary oil vial.
[25:26.32]Wait, hold on.
[25:29.91]Is this a heal?
[25:30.37]Okay, it's a hot.
[25:47.31]Oh, is this a bonfire?
[25:50.15]Stop saying that.
[25:51.75]Okay, activating a Vestal creates a checkpoint where... You know why I'm playing this?
[25:55.78]Because I saw the trailer for Lies of P. And I was like, oh, I want to play like a Souls game again.
[26:08.69]I knew it.
[26:09.25]Well, whatever.
[26:14.71]What's Lies of P?
[26:19.10]No, it's... I'm not saying it wrong, right?
[26:23.85]It's the fucking Pinocchio game.
[26:25.47]It's the Pinocchio Souls-like.
[26:27.45]You understand what I just said?
[26:28.61]Go look it up.
[26:31.29]This feels so weird to say.
[26:37.78]Okay, upgrade attributes by spending... So that's essence, okay, so that's just like Souls.
[26:43.56]Upgrade equipment by spending materials...
[26:47.85]And obtain equipment by spending essence.
[26:50.63]So wait, there's no... You have to buy all the stuff you want to find?
[26:55.22]This is a bonfire.
[26:58.24]That's cool.
[27:04.78]Okay.
[27:12.55]Upgrades.
[27:14.29]Upgrades.
[27:18.39]module slots requires three keys weapons alright I need 1500 essence to upgrade this and a bronze ingot okay so all the upgrades are literally on the same screen which is that's that's good that's cool alright one power one agility what am I what do I want probably agility right agility or power how do I increase damage
[27:49.75]Power.
[27:51.61]I don't have enough souls to do this.
[27:55.70]He hates it.
[27:59.86]This feels like a YouTube somehow.
[28:01.46]A YouTube video.
[28:02.28]Kind of like a director's commentary.
[28:04.04]Why?
[28:04.48]What does that mean?
[28:08.92]This is not a director's commentary.
[28:11.66]What's happening?
[28:13.56]It's the camera angle.
[28:16.97]Do I... Do I have to buy heals?
[28:22.85]It's the camera angle.
[28:23.89]This is a beautiful angle.
[28:25.71]It's perfect.
[28:27.19]I'm right in frame.
[28:28.29]It's got my whole head and body.
[28:29.79]It's direct.
[28:31.11]It's not off to the side.
[28:32.68]This is Director Commentary Andy.
[28:35.44]Alright.
[28:36.12]We're moving on.
[28:38.10]We're moving on.
[28:44.59]Should I buy these?
[28:46.95]Is this stupid?
[28:47.73]Well, maybe it was dumb, but I bought four heels.
[28:52.03]Oh, cool.
[28:52.57]Any hats?
[28:57.04]I'm interested.
[28:58.06]I'm actually interested.
[28:59.14]That seems like a pretty easy... Well, easy is the wrong word.
[29:03.68]It seems like a pretty... It's a good system to put everything in the same place.
[29:08.32]So I don't have to go to this bonfire to find this NPC in the woods.
[29:12.02]That'll teach me how to do a spell, right?
[29:14.30]I know that's cool, but I do appreciate the complete package in the same spot.
[29:21.42]And I'm a huge fan of the Souls games.
[29:23.76]Huge fan.
[29:24.40]You all know that.
[29:25.48]Especially Elden Ring.
[29:29.10]But I do appreciate that.
[29:31.28]Can I sneak?
[29:35.03]There's a lot of staggering in this game too.
[29:36.85]Seems like.
[29:41.07]Oh, okay.
[29:41.47]So I do have a heal that regenerates.
[29:42.89]That's good to know.
[29:46.25]Alright.
[29:46.73]Where's the tutorial boss?
[29:47.69]Let's go.
[29:48.11]Where are you?
[29:51.14]I'm ready for it.
[29:51.71]Let's go this way.
[29:57.10]Wait, didn't I come from this way?
[30:10.38]Oh shit, I'm out of juice.
[30:12.50]Oh fuck, I don't like that.
[30:13.60]Alright, we're good.
[30:15.28]I'm not used to paying attention to that.
[30:19.99]I need deadly boss mods installed.
[30:22.17]Do you know what I'm saying?
[30:24.63]It needs to scream at me that I'm getting close.
[30:34.50]How much does this heal?
[30:35.86]Is it the whole?
[30:36.40]Wait.
[30:37.02]I've gone this way.
[30:38.98]I actually need something like DBM.
[30:42.05]This feels like a zoom call.
[30:43.45]Well, whatever.
[30:47.87]What the hell is that?
[30:51.05]Wait a minute.
[30:53.93]You need a tool to break this.
[30:55.88]No!
[30:56.28]Stop hitting!
[30:58.82]I can't jump that?
[31:02.38]The boss gets...
[31:04.98]Walk onto a targeted approach slowly.
[31:06.54]Ooh, okay.
[31:07.52]That's helpful.
[31:09.92]What is considered slowly in this game?
[31:12.24]That was pretty cool.
[31:13.14]That was pretty cool.
[31:18.18]Somebody's saying this seriously feels like a Zoom call.
[31:26.12]This is a fake reaction.
[31:27.90]It's not!
[31:28.56]You guys need to relax.
[31:37.39]I'm not superimposed on top of the video.
[31:51.16]Okay.
[31:54.30]No joke?
[31:55.16]I missed it.
[31:56.24]The controller... Parasocial Andy Zoom Call.
[32:00.78]This is like a council meeting.
[32:05.79]I'm so confused.
[32:06.61]I'm just gonna play.
[32:09.88]Oh, shit!
[32:16.74]Raid 1.
[32:17.18]Ooh, wait.
[32:18.76]You just obtained a new module.
[32:19.90]I almost just picked my nose on camera.
[32:21.94]You can assign it to a module slot at the same level from the module menu.
[32:26.32]Yeah?
[32:27.50]What's this do?
[32:30.92]Increases health.
[32:31.64]Oh, this is rapid cooling.
[32:35.58]I'm going to put the health one in.
[32:38.08]I feel like I could use it.
[32:45.86]This is definitely going to be something that drops here.
[32:47.24]No way, right?
[32:50.20]This is definitely like tutorial boss place.
[32:52.46]I guess not.
[32:58.51]Maybe it is right here.
[33:04.89]Illegary walls.
[33:13.57]Was supposed to go on a boat.
[33:17.45]the swiss guard killed by the automats that replaced them that's kind of an e3 walk what I just did but you know what I mean alright um this is kind of crazy what's going on here captain degross governor diafri confirms that no command was given to replace your company with a detachment of automats
[33:42.86]I therefore urge you until further notice to keep your distance from these machines and to inform me of any signs of hostility.
[33:48.32]Do not engage unless Her Majesty the Queen is in danger.
[33:50.80]Reinforcements are en route.
[33:52.06]Turtle.
[33:56.86]Get back, man.
[33:58.04]Second in command.
[34:02.10]Oh, whatever.
[34:05.11]Defeat the unstable automat to activate what?
[34:10.66]I can't even touch the bonfire until I kill the boss here.
[34:12.86]Oh, let's go.
[34:16.56]First try, Andy.
[34:17.76]I said Andy.
[34:18.78]Alright, let's go.
[34:19.24]Let's go.
[34:19.50]First try.
[34:19.82]Check it out.
[34:25.21]This is music.
[34:33.93]No.
[34:37.04]All I have is hot.
[34:37.98]Oh, that's bad.
[34:59.44]OK, wait, I'm just resetting it.
[35:20.41]What are you doing?
[35:25.27]What are you doing?
[35:25.65]What are you doing?
[35:35.90]Don't overheat.
[35:36.50]Don't overheat.
[36:17.30]Got him.
[36:20.32]First try.
[36:20.88]Yeah, that was a good story, boss.
[36:22.44]Come on.
[36:23.44]Module key.
[36:27.45]Is this a Surge-like game?
[36:35.71]You've just obtained a module key.
[36:38.50]Aegis has several slots for modules that augment her stats and after the behavior of reading comprehension.
[36:46.29]Let me try that again.
[36:50.38]Aegis has several slots for modules that augment her stats and alter the behavior of certain mechanics.
[36:55.85]The slots have levels that allow Aegis to fit increasingly powerful modules.
[37:00.57]To unlock a slot with the module key, you just obtained, go to the upgrades menu at the Vestal.
[37:06.53]Note, you can equip modules at any given time from Aegis.
[37:09.99]I'm not comprehending this.
[37:10.98]Hold on, let me read it without talking.
[37:16.44]Okay, so I can upgrade my modules?
[37:21.18]That was kind of fun.
[37:23.78]That felt... That felt pretty... That felt clean and responsive.
[37:29.84]That felt pretty responsive.
[37:30.80]That was fun.
[37:33.34]I enjoyed that.
[37:41.93]Let me look at this.
[37:47.21]Okay.
[37:48.79]Oh, I get it.
[37:50.95]So I can have two modules now.
[37:55.14]What does this get me though if I do three keys here?
[37:57.16]Should I just do the other one?
[38:03.91]He's so high right now.
[38:14.37]Level two slot.
[38:15.75]I'll just do, let's just go with this so I can have two modules at the same time.
[38:21.07]It makes sense, right?
[38:25.04]How many souls do I have?
[38:26.80]Oh shit, I can upgrade something.
[38:27.76]What should I do?
[38:30.22]Engineering.
[38:31.04]What does it do?
[38:31.54]How come there's no help menu?
[38:36.07]Affliction multiplier, loot multiplier, and armor.
[38:41.68]This is health, I'm assuming.
[38:43.28]Oh no, it's stamina and critical hit multiplier.
[38:47.63]Durability is health and balance?
[38:53.15]Power resides where men believe it resides.
[38:58.27]It's a trick.
[38:59.61]Shadow on the wall.
[39:15.45]I don't know how people are actors.
[39:19.15]I would get halfway through a line like that and be like, Jesus.
[39:26.98]You are an actor.
[39:29.82]I think I was going to stay with probably this or durability.
[39:36.98]You're camera shy.
[39:37.72]I'm not camera shy.
[39:38.91]Actually, I'd probably be a pretty good dramatic actor.
[39:46.38]You did have a voice acting gig for that phone game.
[39:48.85]I did.
[39:51.99]You're right.
[39:53.89]I think I could be a pretty good actor if I really wanted to.
[40:01.14]I don't know.
[40:02.04]I don't want to ruin the character, so just tell me.
[40:03.98]Somebody help me.
[40:05.26]Should I just do durability?
[40:06.14]I feel like that's safe.
[40:17.30]I mean, I do act on the big event streams, right?
[40:22.18]I get into character.
[40:23.84]I'm going to just do health.
[40:27.76]Because, you know, whatever.
[40:29.00]I just want to be healthier.
[40:36.71]Okay, cool.
[40:42.03]theater kid that's fine alright so yeah now I can put these both in so what does this do slightly reduces the internal damage caused by rapid cooling well it's good just to have them both I'm sure I'll find more so this system I'm assuming is probably going to be like Hollow Knight right that's kind of what it looks like it might be okay cool so now what
[41:21.94]What is the alchemy capsule thing?
[41:26.94]What does this do?
[41:31.18]Quest items?
[41:31.92]No, it's materials.
[41:33.99]No.
[41:34.73]What is it?
[41:37.07]I keep picking it up.
[41:37.73]Where is it?
[41:42.55]It's not a quest item and it's not materials.
[41:44.35]It's not in my access belt.
[41:46.19]What is it?
[41:48.25]It's just souls.
[41:49.53]It is?
[41:54.48]Please eat a booger.
[41:59.50]I keep picking it up.
[42:07.31]The multiverse's banner is still there.
[42:09.99]No, it's not.
[42:11.41]I took it off, didn't I?
[42:14.71]It shouldn't be there.
[42:17.67]Is it still there?
[42:22.25]Hold on.
[42:23.17]Everybody relax.
[42:30.39]It's not still there, right?
[42:35.84]Fuck, it is still there.
[42:36.68]Alright, we're good.
[42:48.22]We're good.
[42:58.14]Why would there ever be a sponsor on this game from?
[43:03.50]Oh, I like crashed my game.
[43:04.80]What happened?
[43:10.60]What I do?
[43:11.02]No, I like all tabbed and it did this.
[43:21.65]That reset the area.
[43:24.37]Why is this lagging?
[43:28.26]Oh, it really does not like that I alt-tabbed.
[43:36.70]Restart.
[43:40.44]Should I just restart?
[43:41.06]Just back to the main menu and restart?
[43:44.29]Alt-tab again.
[43:50.67]Shit.
[43:51.81]I'm going to... It saves it right here, right?
[43:55.15]I'll just reload it.
[44:02.45]It's a dev and chat right now.
[44:03.79]Help!
[44:04.13]What do I do?
[44:04.59]I'll just restart it.
[44:09.27]That's fine.
[44:22.02]I think I'm gonna be sick.
[44:29.83]Shit, what happened?
[44:33.21]I turned on MultiVersus banner and my game freaked out.
[44:40.42]Why is that such a stupid?
[44:42.62]OK, I think I have to reset the whole game.
[44:50.72]Give me one sec.
[44:55.74]Restart the whole game.
[44:58.31]I'm interested, I'm still here.
[45:03.98]Trust me, I would have stopped by now.
[45:07.86]I would have... Okay, let's try it again.
[45:24.11]NVIDIA GeForce RTX.
[45:28.32]Does anybody actually turn that on?
[45:37.51]I have a 3090 and I don't think I've ever used it.
[45:42.05]I think we turned it on for one minute in Resident Evil 8.
[45:45.51]To me, it's just like, oh, hey, RTX is cool.
[45:50.58]It might, like, fuck up the whole game, though.
[45:54.10]Every time I've ever used it, it just slows everything down.
[45:55.90]There's a chest over here.
[45:58.72]Did that hurt?
[46:13.22]Why is his head shaped like Stewie Griffin?
[46:17.28]What?
[46:17.44]I have a musket?
[46:21.57]How do I use it?
[46:27.91]Wait, hold on.
[46:28.41]I can... Wait a minute.
[46:31.31]Why didn't I do this?
[46:38.00]Alchemy damage.
[46:38.78]Flame, Frost, and Fulmination.
[46:42.44]when she uses alchemy capsules for each attack.
[46:46.24]Alchemical damage fills a gauge which, when full, triggers an affliction, which lasts an... Okay.
[46:51.84]Ignite.
[46:54.04]Frost.
[46:55.58]And Fullmetal Alchemist.
[47:01.33]Is electrocution.
[47:04.67]So should I... I have 36 bullets?
[47:11.68]How many bullets do I have?
[47:17.21]34?
[47:17.41]Does this refill?
[47:18.21]Do I have infinite?
[47:21.43]No, I only have 34.
[47:22.17]Okay, don't waste it.
[47:22.89]Let's try it though.
[47:35.79]What's the range on it?
[47:41.99]That's fucking way I've rented money.
[47:45.16]That's actually pretty cool.
[47:48.40]Alright, that's cool.
[47:52.30]So you just this is ammo.
[47:53.20]You just pick it up.
[47:55.20]You wasted all your ammo.
[47:56.16]I didn't.
[47:56.48]I needed to see how it worked before I fought anything.
[48:01.88]A lantern new zone.
[48:06.16]Ran it caught.
[48:06.57]What is this cobblestone do?
[48:13.39]Okay, there is a jump attack.
[48:15.65]There's a hover attack too.
[48:23.37]I do like the fact that the dodge, when you dodge an attack, you go around them and not just to the side.
[48:28.68]I do enjoy, I enjoy it.
[48:38.71]What happened to my eyebrows?
[48:39.59]What do you mean?
[48:43.92]Ooh, here.
[48:44.68]Flame resistance down, but everything else up.
[48:49.49]Let's put it on.
[48:49.93]Uh, I thought this hit pog shoes.
[48:57.23]Okay, endurance up.
[49:07.40]Cool.
[49:07.72]Alright, let's go.
[49:10.51]This is blocked.
[49:11.47]Probably a shortcut, I think.
[49:13.87]Maybe.
[49:17.09]New enemy type.
[49:23.59]Flame.
[49:33.82]Cool.
[49:37.26]Item?
[49:53.30]I thought I dodged it.
[49:54.94]I think the iframes are small.
[49:56.12]I don't think they're very big.
[50:07.75]That's fun.
[50:10.75]Excuse me.
[50:12.11]What's with the iframes?
[50:12.87]It's because I alt tabbed.
[50:15.73]That's annoying.
[50:16.80]I alt tabbed.
[50:24.31]Nice hairline angle.
[50:28.57]I think it looks fine.
[50:38.97]That's very generous.
[50:41.19]The backstab range on that was I was 100 feet away.
[50:50.97]OK, cool.
[50:53.14]You're dodging into where they attack.
[50:57.16]I know that, like, when you first came to this channel, you probably didn't see it, but it says no backseating.
[51:03.88]I got a compass.
[51:10.47]Oh, I can set a waypoint.
[51:12.17]Nemesis claws.
[51:14.87]Excuse me?
[51:21.21]Already got a new weapon.
[51:22.03]Alright, hold on.
[51:22.58]This is...
[51:24.28]The scale's better with agility.
[51:26.42]52.
[51:28.68]This is... But hold on.
[51:30.25]The weight is... Impact... Alright, this is worse, but... Counter to any parry that is timed just right reverses the effects of the enemy's attack and deals physical damage.
[51:38.95]Let me... How are they?
[51:39.67]Are they cool?
[51:46.32]Like scarecrow hands?
[51:49.60]So that's a parry.
[51:52.54]I wonder how hard it is to do.
[51:53.50]Should I try it?
[51:54.48]I'll try it for a minute.
[52:05.89]Somebody else can read that.
[52:07.81]I didn't mean to press that button.
[52:11.03]Dude, you're balding.
[52:12.29]I'm almost 40.
[52:14.33]Don't worry.
[52:16.81]I know.
[52:20.28]You wish you have this hair when you're 37.
[52:23.50]You'll wish that you had this fucking hairline when you're almost 40 like me.
[52:29.38]How do I get up there?
[52:38.46]I can definitely get up there.
[52:39.26]There's a chest up there.
[52:48.27]How do I get up here?
[52:54.53]It's like an elevator or something.
[53:01.42]Maybe the rope.
[53:01.94]I don't think there's a grab.
[53:09.00]Shoot the gun.
[53:10.92]Can I re-aim the gun?
[53:19.27]I don't think I can get up there right now.
[53:20.83]Maybe later.
[53:21.53]Wait.
[53:27.89]Shit, there's a chest up there.
[53:32.15]The other rope?
[53:38.68]I don't know if I can get up there.
[53:39.48]I'm just waiting for someone to say the solution.
[53:51.60]You know, being a streamer is great for a few reasons.
[53:53.94]It has its pros and cons, right?
[53:55.72]During a broadcast.
[53:57.38]But it's great to be able to just kind of go like this.
[54:03.95]And then go, oh, what if I, uh... What if I attack the rope?
[54:08.55]And then everyone's like, oh, he figured it out!
[54:09.93]Pog!
[54:10.43]That's the best part about being a streamer.
[54:12.55]Is you just don't know when I just look at chat and read the answer.
[54:17.30]And we all do it.
[54:18.40]Everybody does it.
[54:19.18]If you're a streamer and you say you don't do that, come on, Gwynn.
[54:23.39]It's very subtle.
[54:24.11]It's like the... Oh, what the... Where do I fucking go?
[54:30.32]Guys.
[54:33.08]Oh, you know what I could try?
[54:34.12]I could try jumping twice here.
[54:36.17]Alright, well, I'm just leaving.
[54:41.35]That should not have hurt.
[54:42.51]Game got a lower grade for that.
[54:44.85]Y1 full letter grade.
[54:52.92]Oh, this is it.
[54:54.04]Okay, what the fuck?
[55:01.80]I just got sucked into the game.
[55:05.65]Can you fast travel?
[55:09.75]Let's see the bald spot.
[55:10.81]Good.
[55:14.45]I don't have a bald spot.
[55:20.82]Alright, what about this boutique?
[55:24.36]Wait, I can just buy this stuff.
[55:26.78]Alright.
[55:28.16]The letter grade came back.
[55:33.95]So I own the compass.
[55:37.29]Oh, I can sell.
[55:38.01]Alright.
[55:38.61]Is there anything?
[55:39.05]Can I sell this stuff?
[55:43.75]Ew, look it.
[55:47.61]So this is just the crunchies from those other games that we will not compare it to.
[55:53.68]I can level up again.
[56:02.59]Oh, I can just use it from here.
[56:07.47]That work.
[56:10.86]Oh, OK.
[56:12.20]I guess it worked.
[56:18.06]Alright, so agility.
[56:18.96]Yeah.
[56:23.58]I think.
[56:25.89]That makes sense, right?
[56:26.69]I have a weapon that scales with agility.
[56:29.21]Most of my stuff is scaling with agility.
[56:34.93]Alright, that was cool.
[56:38.23]So, from here... I'm trying to figure out where to go from here.
[56:48.23]I gotta check for secret areas.
[56:49.21]There's probably a secret area behind this rock that I'm doing on my own and thinking of.
[56:55.49]I feel like I'm trying to use my knowledge of the game and everything.
[56:59.09]That there's a secret behind the rock and it's like a rare weapon.
[57:02.29]It might be.
[57:02.59]I don't know.
[57:02.91]It's possible.
[57:05.77]I have a lot of game knowledge, though.
[57:19.90]Ordinary vile.
[57:20.64]Alright, let's get another boss!
[57:27.08]I'm using the new weapons, alright?
[57:33.64]How do I get them to spin?
[57:37.16]Didn't they go... Last time?
[57:40.39]How do I do that?
[57:43.89]Didn't they spin?
[57:44.57]Am I out of my mind?
[57:45.43]They spun.
[57:50.43]There it is.
[57:50.91]Okay, it's the next one.
[58:16.46]I actually like, I kind of like the claws.
[58:17.62]I didn't get anything.
[58:28.62]Oh, I was like, what?
[58:29.60]Alright.
[58:30.78]Oh, I got a key.
[58:36.76]Did they put you in a box with a camera this time?
[58:42.08]New enemy type, quiet.
[59:05.64]You can tell he's not playing the game.
[59:07.40]You know what I've thought of before?
[59:17.15]I've thought of hiring somebody that was a true video gamer, right?
[59:22.05]And just have them off to the side while I sit there.
[59:25.20]And we have a controller set up where both the controllers are player one.
[59:31.53]You know what I mean?
[59:32.35]So we have two controllers.
[59:33.59]Both are player one.
[59:35.12]It's not player one and player two.
[59:36.72]So they would have a controller here and I would have the same controller.
[59:39.94]And they'd be doing insane.
[59:41.14]And I can, whenever I want, just take over and just start playing.
[59:45.20]And hold up the controller and be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[59:47.44]I'm literally doing it.
[59:48.40]And move on my own.
[59:49.90]Show me moving with the controller and everything.
[59:52.64]You would absolutely fall for it.
[59:53.80]Because why would you ever think it wasn't happening?
[59:57.74]Destiny 2 PvP.
[60:02.99]I'll say it again, my favorite part of that whole stream was... Eren!
[60:08.87]Eren!
[60:12.22]I think you can actually hear me laugh off camera.
[60:15.98]Well, not off camera, but in the call.
[60:20.44]Eren!
[60:21.44]Eren!
[60:24.44]It's too good.
[60:26.08]It's pervert.
[60:33.99]House.
[60:42.89]Ooh, the R2 is actually really good on that.
[60:46.45]I like the R2.
[60:46.89]Can I go in the house?
[60:47.89]I don't want to get too... Ooh.
[61:10.44]If you could be any dinosaur, what would you want to be?
[61:16.22]Pterodactyl.
[61:20.96]They're the only ones who truly survived because they turned into birds.
[61:26.86]We're getting weapons every five seconds here, really?
[61:30.32]That's another weapon?
[61:31.08]Falchion and Saber.
[61:40.33]C affinity.
[61:43.45]Let me try it.
[61:48.90]These are cool.
[61:50.06]What's the special?
[61:52.96]Why would you use a different weapon?
[61:59.96]Is there a reason to use a different item?
[62:06.16]How much more damage does this do?
[62:11.44]56.
[62:11.50]This has... Yeah, these are better.
[62:17.00]I'll use them for a little while.
[62:20.32]It overheats really quickly.
[62:21.32]I feel like the move kit is way better.
[62:25.75]I like the clouds.
[62:27.21]They're okay.
[62:29.91]Oh, but yeah, I'd be a pterodactyl.
[62:32.67]Because essentially every modern dinosaur is a pterodactyl.
[62:37.75]And when modern dinosaur, I mean birds.
[62:41.21]And alligators survive too.
[62:42.41]Because I mean, they're fucking based, you know what I mean?
[62:45.33]Like, of course they're gonna live.
[63:05.35]Catalyst?
[63:06.65]You have enough materials to upgrade the barrette.
[63:08.93]Open the upgrades menu at a vestal and use Lavo.
[63:11.81]You see your catalyst to increase the number of doses.
[63:15.28]Okay, so this is like Estus Blast.
[63:17.54]Alright, that's good.
[63:21.76]Did I do everything over here?
[63:28.96]Did I save everything?
[63:31.12]What's this?
[63:36.22]We need a tool to break this.
[63:37.90]Oh.
[63:40.63]Oh, I do?
[63:45.09]No, I don't.
[63:50.17]Nothing?
[64:00.24]Here it comes.
[64:07.15]That boat's going to take you to Paris?
[64:10.25]Are you sure?
[64:21.40]How do I get back here?
[64:24.12]Unstable lightning ram.
[64:25.15]Alright, how do I get back here?
[64:26.23]I actually don't remember.
[64:37.55]Oh my god, just get absolutely fucking decimated.
[65:15.97]This guy is fucking easy.
[65:31.51]I win.
[65:40.68]Do I just have like the perfect build for that?
[65:42.16]That guy was not hard.
[65:43.44]That guy was very, very much chump.
[65:48.29]That guy... That was a test.
[65:50.80]That's the first time they've ever used this thing.
[66:00.79]It's going to cut to like the Dr. Robotnik level of mad scientist over here in some ditch that's hiding with a remote control being like blasted.
[66:08.77]I can't believe my creation was killed so easily.
[66:11.98]That's how that's the level of how bad that was.
[66:21.86]Hey, I'll take it.
[66:22.59]I'm happy.
[66:23.11]The first guy was actually pretty hard.
[66:26.39]The first guy was pretty challenging, although I did kind of cheese that.
[66:29.11]So is that really fair for me to say that?
[66:31.06]This boat will take me to Paris.
[66:35.12]Make sure I can't do anything else.
[66:38.17]I choose the absolute hell.
[66:39.29]What difficulty is it?
[66:40.17]It's the whatever the regular one.
[66:42.13]I choose that app 100%.
[66:52.43]You're going to meet your compact ancestor on France.
[66:56.85]I'm not French.
[67:10.89]On France?
[67:24.44]Wait, what is this?
[67:25.10]One of the mods is trying to gaslight me.
[67:34.07]But though pterosaurs lived among dinosaurs and certainly looked like dinosaurs to the untrained eye, the two groups are not the same.
[67:43.06]Okay.
[67:51.26]Pterodactyls weren't dinosaurs.
[67:52.54]They were another species.
[67:57.74]Hold on.
[67:58.16]Wait.
[67:58.50]Was Paris across the lake?
[68:04.76]That's not where I came from, right?
[68:06.12]Is that where I came from?
[68:09.94]This doesn't make any sense.
[68:11.56]No, right?
[68:12.30]I had to go down a whole... This... No.
[68:16.42]I was going to say, you could have shot me out of a cannon over here in the beginning of the game.
[68:26.27]I got to find a... A vest... A vestule, not a bonfire.
[68:46.47]I don't lose all those souls, right?
[68:48.43]Okay.
[68:53.49]What?
[68:53.83]Alright.
[69:00.33]I think you went down the River Seine.
[69:03.27]That goes right through the middle of Paris.
[69:05.51]What?
[69:05.83]Where am I?
[69:06.43]I don't even know... Never mind.
[69:09.97]He is playing.
[69:10.98]Yeah.
[69:11.26]Can I climb this?
[69:28.23]Oh my God, you ruined my moment.
[69:29.33]I actually, I'm kind of scared because I, where's the, I need a save point.
[69:40.88]Oh, there's one there, but, ooh, chest, no.
[69:45.16]Frost grenade, cool.
[70:00.89]I like this area.
[70:04.39]Cool.
[70:05.25]I can probably level up a couple of times.
[70:12.29]Oh, no.
[70:16.11]You can't go through the gate, right?
[70:24.06]How come you can go through the gate, but I can't?
[70:25.92]Alright.
[70:29.00]Well, there's the bonfire.
[70:31.40]Best... Whatever it is.
[70:34.06]Bestel.
[70:38.78]Can you do something funny?
[70:39.90]My mom is watching.
[70:42.75]Um... No.
[70:44.27]Go do your homework.
[70:51.23]How about... I think it's just agility and durability.
[70:57.66]If I can do both.
[71:03.67]I can, uh, crush some crunchies.
[71:05.31]Okay.
[71:16.60]Is that enough?
[71:17.92]I'll do durability.
[71:21.49]He's 24.
[71:21.83]I'm gonna hold onto the key.
[71:38.99]You don't know that.
[71:43.48]Does the price go up every time or down every time?
[71:45.78]Wait, is that how many?
[71:46.66]Oh, I have 218 of these.
[71:47.98]Why am I buying them?
[71:52.42]OK, let's.
[71:55.26]Stretch out a little.
[71:58.95]A little bit bomb.
[72:04.43]What's the best salad recipe to learn for a recent grad?
[72:10.02]Depends on what you like.
[72:12.30]Red cabbage with... I don't like it.
[72:15.60]Caesar salad I usually don't like.
[72:20.14]Caesar salad to me is not a food.
[72:24.26]Is it weird for me to say that?
[72:25.88]I feel like Caesar salad is not a rough food.
[72:27.56]It's not a real food.
[72:29.68]It's like shredded lettuce croutons and like fucking dressing.
[72:34.22]I genuinely don't find it to be a real food.
[72:37.60]What about chicken?
[72:51.65]Well, hold on.
[72:52.15]You didn't say chicken Caesar salad.
[72:54.09]We're talking about just Caesar salad.
[72:58.45]Chicken Caesar salad changes everything.
[73:22.46]Is this respawn?
[73:23.32]I didn't even ask this question.
[73:25.10]Does this respawn enemies?
[73:31.64]I don't think it does.
[73:32.32]Okay, it does.
[73:45.12]Okay.
[73:45.76]What was I saying?
[73:46.76]Yeah.
[73:47.08]Okay.
[73:47.34]So Caesar salad to me is, well, listen, the nutritional content of just regular lettuce is really not that high.
[73:56.67]The nutritional content of just chunks of bread, just croutons is really not that high.
[74:02.85]So if you're eating a Caesar salad for lunch, you're not really getting very much.
[74:08.50]It's just kind of nothing.
[74:13.78]A little side of a Caesar salad, that's fine.
[74:15.50]But if you're like, oh yeah, I'll take a Caesar salad, you're not really getting a whole lot of nutritional value.
[74:18.68]You're just not.
[74:20.84]But it tastes good.
[74:22.92]You can name me a bunch of other things that taste good too that are much better for you.
[74:28.67]Can I get up there?
[74:31.89]Lettuce has vitamins.
[74:36.35]Okay, lettuce has vitamins.
[74:42.32]I don't think lettuce has that many vitamins.
[74:45.77]It depends on what kind of lettuce you're talking about.
[74:52.43]Spinach.
[74:52.91]Yeah, you didn't say spinach, but you said lettuce.
[74:58.52]I love spinach.
[74:59.18]Spinach is one of my favorite foods.
[75:01.00]Spinach is one of the best things ever.
[75:04.24]How do I get out of here?
[75:21.72]How do I get out of here?
[75:25.56]Oh, okay.
[75:29.50]Water flask?
[75:30.86]That's a cool move.
[75:49.81]You know, I think the problem with salads are or is the problem with the salad for me is when I'm hungry, I don't it's not like, oh, I'm hungry.
[76:00.66]I can't wait to eat salad.
[76:02.80]I wish salad was more substantial.
[76:06.06]And I know that you can make salad more substantial, right?
[76:08.50]But eventually you get to a point where there's so much shit in the salad that it's kind of just like kind of a mess.
[76:22.33]Oh God.
[76:33.77]Come on!
[76:34.41]What the?
[76:34.65]Oh my goodness, that was a long cooldown.
[76:38.92]Romaine is alright.
[76:40.66]Romaine's good.
[76:43.56]Salad toppers.
[76:52.98]Alright, hold on, let me check this way.
[76:55.61]That's a Boston take?
[76:59.99]Maybe it is because on the East Coast, and this is completely different than it is here in Vegas and on the West Coast I've found.
[77:08.01]I was spoiled rotten with some of the... The East Coast just has some of the best pizza, the best sub shops, the best fucking sandwich places.
[77:18.62]Oh, you want it?
[77:19.02]You want like a big sub?
[77:20.88]The best in the world is on the East Coast.
[77:24.28]Boston, New York, Philadelphia.
[77:26.95]I mean...
[77:28.83]I was spoiled rotten.
[77:30.65]So eating like a big steak and cheese with like grilled onions on it.
[77:34.73]I don't want to eat the salad with pine nuts.
[77:36.82]Like what happened?
[77:48.71]I'm so jealous.
[77:49.51]I miss it all the time.
[77:50.39]I really do.
[77:53.11]Going back to the East Coast, going back to Boston.
[78:00.12]Getting pizza from there just hits so different.
[78:03.02]So different.
[78:05.84]A good, nice, thin crust just right out of the oven.
[78:09.18]Oh my god.
[78:09.92]This is not the same.
[78:16.75]Not here.
[78:17.27]Not at all.
[78:18.93]There's decent pizza places around here, but I wouldn't call them good.
[78:24.96]Hold on.
[78:25.18]I gotta be quiet.
[78:25.66]This is kind of a hard pull.
[78:32.61]I won't do it.
[78:33.05]Alright, we're good.
[78:46.17]The east coast is terrible for stargazing.
[78:51.07]I'd rather a steak and cheese sub than stargazing.
[78:54.87]Okay, on my tier list of location-based things, stargazing is way below like a Philly cheesesteak.
[79:02.93]It just is.
[79:13.61]But I love Vegas.
[79:17.14]I love it out here.
[79:19.23]So while I lose a lot of my favorite local awesome sub shops and pizza places, I gained Las Vegas.
[79:27.21]Which is, man, there's a whole lot more to do.
[79:29.34]There's a whole lot more going on out here.
[79:37.24]I gotta put some stuff in my bar here.
[79:38.70]Alright, hold on.
[79:39.68]Should I go back and... This game's fun.
[79:46.83]I actually like this game.
[79:51.84]I have to be pessimistic Andy every time I open a video game.
[79:55.96]I actually think this is fun.
[79:56.70]This game's cute.
[80:11.83]Yeah, this game's cute.
[80:14.22]Oh wait, get that off.
[80:22.40]I hear something large.
[80:25.33]New Jersey pizza and subs are amazing.
[80:27.07]I know.
[80:28.29]New York.
[80:29.17]New Jersey.
[80:46.86]Don't.
[80:51.03]Alright, do I have a cutscene?
[80:54.35]Vegas kind of scares me.
[80:55.19]I went there as a minor and I don't know what he said, but Vegas is a very adult city.
[81:00.79]That's true.
[81:10.32]Oh, I just picked up a water flask.
[81:18.00]Water's evil play.
[81:21.84]You want some water?
[81:29.81]Drink it in front of her.
[81:30.89]Five petrification grenades for a glass of water?
[81:36.41]I'll bring you the whole moat.
[81:40.78]What else you got in there?
[81:44.80]Why is Mod Chat taunting me right now?
[81:51.25]A mod right now is posting their pizza that they got.
[81:56.65]And it's fucking amazing looking.
[81:58.57]What the hell?
[82:00.07]Why are you taunting me?
[82:07.80]That looks so good.
[82:08.58]Oh my god, I want it.
[82:09.60]I just want that to burn my face so bad.
[82:12.40]I want to take a bite of that and have the cheese come off, slide off, and hit me right here.
[82:16.16]And I go... I want it so bad.
[82:25.71]I want to be the first person to do that, and everybody else all collectively puts their pieces down.
[82:29.43]You know what I'm saying?
[82:31.67]Like, we get it!
[82:32.25]There it is!
[82:32.89]Oh, yeah!
[82:33.31]Okay, you got a plate?
[82:36.52]And everybody goes, oh, alright.
[82:39.72]And we wait.
[82:40.16]We, like, just talk about, like, sports for fucking ten minutes.
[82:45.52]And I go, no, no, that's not ready.
[82:46.72]It's too hot.
[82:47.20]Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[82:48.42]I point over at the person over here.
[82:50.61]Hot, dude, dude, hot.
[82:51.29]It's hot, hot, hot.
[82:51.87]And they go, oh, okay, thanks, man.
[83:05.00]I feel like I should level up.
[83:07.12]I don't like this.
[83:18.59]What is that?
[83:19.01]Um, should I just say fucking go?
[83:27.79]I only have two heal.
[83:28.69]I got, I got, I got heal.
[83:29.61]Yeah, I'm alright.
[83:33.47]Can I jump this fence?
[83:36.48]there's a weirdo over there jump animation jump animation looks like that TikTok where they go you know what I'm talking about where they go they go like side to side like this you know what I'm talking about it's where they go like this they go like
[84:02.85]Some people must have to know what I'm talking about.
[84:04.29]They put their arms up and it's like boing, boing, boing, boing.
[84:17.22]Boomer on TikTok.
[84:18.38]I don't use TikTok.
[84:19.46]I'm just I was trying to relate that to some of you guys know what I'm saying.
[84:22.10]Alright.
[84:22.40]There's a there's a fight here.
[84:23.78]So quiet now.
[84:30.18]That was midair.
[84:40.30]Dude, the frost is so unbelievable in this game.
[84:42.98]It's like three hits.
[84:45.18]Alright, this guy is kind of hard.
[84:54.99]Is this a class thing?
[84:56.25]Because this is the best class for sure.
[84:57.71]Okay.
[85:18.17]The only people on TikTok are influencers.
[85:21.81]You might need to walk that one back.
[85:24.49]That's not true.
[85:25.11]I feel like I'm close to a boss.
[85:46.00]Alright, this is kind of scary.
[85:57.26]This is kind of fucked up.
[86:00.70]I'm going to pick this up and something's going to drop, right?
[86:09.39]Ah, where is it?
[86:12.97]There's something about that metal boom, boom, boom, boom.
[86:19.26]Talk more about lettuce.
[86:20.98]What do you want me to say?
[86:24.34]Shit.
[86:28.76]Alright, I'm going to I'm going to just gun this person.
[86:35.74]New area.
[86:36.67]Oh, wait a minute.
[86:39.03]Is this a shortcut or something?
[86:42.97]It's not a shortcut.
[86:54.60]There's just one.
[86:55.12]If there's just one, I'll take it.
[87:05.59]Flame, resistance, vial.
[87:07.51]Oh, there's definitely gonna be a flame enemy.
[87:11.50]Uh, lettuce.
[87:12.08]Okay, so there's... Lettuce is, um... I love the taste of lettuce and mayo.
[87:20.01]And, like... Like, lettuce, chicken, and mayo together.
[87:24.43]Like, that shredded lettuce.
[87:25.41]Alright, I need to play really cautiously here.
[87:41.33]Yeah, I'm playing like an absolute coward right now.
[88:01.52]There's no way I'm gonna have not died.
[88:02.90]You know what I'm saying?
[88:13.13]If there's no diminishing returns on Frost, then why?
[88:15.62]I'm going to just the combo every time.
[88:24.72]Oh, my God.
[88:26.16]Okay.
[88:39.15]I need health.
[88:46.93]Fire chain?
[88:48.03]I can upgrade the weapons, can't I?
[88:49.73]What should I do?
[88:51.17]Which one should I upgrade?
[88:55.64]I'm running out of ammo.
[89:01.84]Shit.
[89:02.34]Alright.
[89:02.68]Hold on.
[89:03.08]Wait, wait, wait.
[89:03.42]I'm not going over there yet.
[89:05.88]Upgrade the gun?
[89:07.60]The gun is alchemy, though.
[89:08.84]Hold on.
[89:13.11]Grade 2 stable charging?
[89:18.25]Oh my god, I was actually puked.
[89:19.69]Okay, this is just a pole.
[89:42.60]No!
[89:46.29]Alright, flame grenade.
[89:47.16]Take that off.
[89:48.40]Alright, explosive grenade.
[89:51.54]What about the compass?
[89:52.36]Maybe I'll use it.
[89:54.90]And then frost grenade?
[89:55.78]And take this off.
[90:01.51]So what does the compass do?
[90:02.43]Let me use it.
[90:04.25]What does it do?
[90:07.67]Oh, wow.
[90:11.21]Oh, I can...
[90:13.38]I can just... Alright, that's cool.
[90:17.92]I get to have a quest marker.
[90:23.01]I'll take it.
[90:23.45]That's fine with me.
[90:41.68]Oh, thank God.
[90:43.04]I need that right now.
[90:51.11]Is it on hard?
[90:53.11]Could I have even... I don't think I could have even selected hard.
[90:55.27]I don't think that was an option.
[90:59.65]I just played on whatever the regular mode is.
[91:16.67]I'm going to sneeze.
[91:28.80]Shortcut!
[91:31.34]There's no pause.
[91:32.76]Oh, there is a pause.
[91:33.44]Never mind.
[91:34.06]It's not like the Voldemort game that we can't say.
[91:40.58]There we go.
[91:48.41]Should I do... I don't know.
[91:51.99]I feel like the gun is amazing.
[91:53.37]It's actually incredible and I should have started with it.
[91:57.36]Show auto?
[91:58.00]I will.
[91:59.10]Just not yet.
[91:59.58]I'm playing this game.
[92:06.02]I don't think it's power ever.
[92:08.21]Engineering.
[92:10.35]Engineering is what?
[92:10.83]Like the luck stat in this game?
[92:20.88]How come you're changing your camera angles every stream?
[92:22.50]Do you have ass acne?
[92:28.43]You've never seen a camera from back there.
[92:39.13]When?
[92:44.00]That's never happened.
[92:46.76]Maybe a point in Dura- yeah.
[92:49.61]I feel like it's probably a good idea.
[92:51.95]This is like stamina.
[92:54.63]Right?
[92:55.53]Yeah.
[92:58.88]Do I have enough to do it again?
[93:02.42]Alright, so how does this scale?
[93:05.18]Wait a second.
[93:06.02]Hold on.
[93:06.30]That's a weapon.
[93:07.74]I thought that was a module.
[93:11.69]So say whatever you want about this game.
[93:13.33]Go ahead and say it.
[93:14.07]But this is the fifth weapon.
[93:18.86]In an hour and 10 minutes.
[93:21.92]What is this?
[93:22.36]Alright, that's kind of funky.
[93:34.43]Cool.
[93:35.47]And now it's on fire.
[93:40.47]Oh yeah, that's cool.
[93:41.87]Not going to be using it though.
[93:47.01]60 wait 61 plus 25.
[93:54.54]This is better.
[93:55.02]I guess I mean, what do I want to upgrade?
[94:05.32]This is the highest scaling.
[94:17.72]Oh my goodness.
[94:18.90]It doesn't have to be a sidearm.
[94:20.38]That's not even a sidearm.
[94:21.60]This is an actual weapon.
[94:24.82]Alright, cool.
[94:25.66]I'll try it for a little while.
[94:34.99]Are you the booger guy?
[94:35.81]Uh, yeah.
[94:37.39]You probably found me from that clip of me like I thought the stream was off.
[94:42.44]Then the camera was still on.
[94:43.44]It was pretty dark, but you know, you could still see.
[94:46.68]And I just ate a shitload of... I was eating boogers in the chair for like 10 straight minutes.
[94:50.62]Everyone's seen the clip by now, but whatever.
[94:52.18]Yeah, that's fine.
[94:53.69]I'm glad you found the stream.
[94:55.01]I mean, without that viral clip, I wouldn't have... You know, you wouldn't have been here.
[94:58.19]You wouldn't have found it.
[94:58.77]Alright, so this is just the three doses.
[95:10.40]Cool.
[95:10.56]Cool.
[95:12.68]Alright, I'll come back and figure this out later.
[95:18.50]These grenades work pretty well.
[95:19.80]Yeah, I'm going to buy as many of these as I can.
[95:28.42]I can upgrade something?
[95:29.28]What can I upgrade?
[95:35.96]How come there's still a you can upgrade thing?
[95:41.66]Oh, because I have keys.
[95:43.34]I'm going to hold on to him though.
[95:44.24]I don't want to use him.
[95:54.79]Alright, let's go.
[95:56.89]So that, I opened up the shortcut, which is here.
[96:03.10]No, I'm not wearing a hairnet.
[96:21.50]This item is cool.
[96:24.93]God damn it.
[96:25.57]Everything has been cool so far.
[96:27.05]Am I going the wrong way?
[96:36.05]I'm definitely going the wrong way.
[96:38.70]There it is.
[96:38.96]This is the right way, right?
[96:41.38]Yeah.
[96:53.68]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[96:54.98]Am I going the wrong way?
[96:57.82]Wait, is that the wrong way?
[97:04.29]Didn't I open up a shortcut that led right here?
[97:06.85]Wait, I'm confused.
[97:12.70]Oh, thank god I've got the compass!
[97:28.33]There it is.
[97:31.83]Excellent.
[97:32.79]I am going to res... Yes.
[97:34.15]Okay.
[97:34.79]We got it.
[97:39.81]I'm so glad that exists.
[97:44.15]Hey, you know what they could have done?
[97:45.05]Which would have been funny?
[97:46.77]To turn the compass on, it takes souls.
[97:49.62]It's like 500 souls to turn the compass on.
[97:52.52]That would be funny.
[97:53.78]And it scales as you level.
[97:58.04]Would have been kind of fun.
[97:59.16]That would have been kind of funny.
[98:00.00]Alright, there we go.
[98:04.46]This is what I'm doing.
[98:12.56]Don't worry about that.
[98:17.16]This is it.
[98:17.60]Alright.
[98:19.58]Let's freaking go!
[98:30.52]What the hell was that?
[98:31.12]That fire looks crazy!
[98:37.70]That actually looks awesome!
[99:20.14]Oh, now you're on fire.
[99:21.24]You haven't been on fire this whole time?
[99:22.68]That took a long time to get you there.
[99:36.67]Get up there.
[99:37.07]Get up.
[99:37.27]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[99:47.81]No ammo.
[99:52.64]What are you talking about?
[99:53.50]How come you're using a yo-yo?
[100:06.82]Because it's kind of fun.
[100:09.66]Alright.
[100:13.07]The weapon's cool, but it's a little too slow for me.
[100:14.81]It has a little too much lead up.
[100:19.15]Very cool, though.
[100:32.77]Essence of a valiant spirit.
[100:44.86]Okay.
[100:46.42]We gotta go this way.
[100:57.47]Wait.
[101:09.20]I already came this way.
[101:15.10]Did I?
[101:17.40]Can I open that?
[101:19.73]Wait, where am I?
[101:21.59]Compass?
[101:23.09]Thank you.
[101:33.98]This up.
[101:36.00]There's no way I ever would have figured that out.
[101:40.36]Like, are you kidding me?
[101:41.06]I never would have jumped up here for no reason.
[101:51.22]Why does the camera get worse every stream?
[101:53.13]This camera is in a perfect angle.
[101:56.67]It's in a perfect position.
[101:58.59]This is the most in-frame I've ever been in my whole life on stream.
[102:02.59]It's the most in-frame.
[102:04.57]This is the most you've seen me here.
[102:09.89]And I just maybe drink a potion.
[102:11.91]Time that person out for an hour.
[102:13.89]At least an hour.
[102:29.66]Endurance and armor.
[102:30.80]Yep.
[102:34.62]Absolute in frame.
[102:35.42]This is the most absolutely in frame I've ever been.
[102:40.79]Ready.
[102:40.93]What's the compass say?
[102:42.63]I feel like a boss is incoming.
[103:02.79]Could be wrong.
[103:08.58]I wonder how much I'm going to absolutely style on this boss coming up.
[103:13.88]Find out.
[103:26.55]I've got a ton.
[103:27.31]Where are these petrification grenades?
[103:29.59]Like 10 of these.
[103:34.32]This immobilizes enemies.
[103:35.76]Alright, well, let's go.
[103:42.39]Look directly into the camera for a little while.
[103:44.55]No.
[103:54.52]Why am I hearing this music?
[103:55.45]Oh, this guy's throwing rocks.
[104:10.16]Can we talk?
[104:20.15]What is that?
[104:20.57]How do I talk through the window?
[104:26.25]Can I get in?
[104:37.18]I don't think I can even talk to this person.
[104:43.39]Oh no, thank you.
[104:49.12]How?
[105:06.04]Alright, shoot this guy down.
[105:10.24]I don't know.
[105:10.80]I don't read this.
[105:15.56]I don't wanna- I'm fighting people!
[105:17.34]Okay, now I can read the note on the ground.
[105:44.30]I don't even, why do I want, I don't want to read the note.
[105:48.06]What the, oh my god, I just realized what that was.
[105:49.60]Okay.
[106:04.50]Okay.
[106:06.08]Ooh.
[106:08.86]That shouldn't hurt.
[106:11.82]By the way, I'm made out of, like, stainless steel or something.
[106:15.94]Why would that hurt?
[106:16.62]I'm a robot.
[106:21.49]I'm made out of metal and shit.
[106:23.43]Why would a falling five feet off... Why would that hurt me?
[106:44.80]Alright, that's fair.
[106:48.73]Wait, what's over here?
[106:59.99]Even at max resolution, your camera is off.
[107:18.54]Wow, that does a lot of damage.
[107:26.18]They quick work dogs.
[107:28.78]He's ranging.
[107:30.66]He's raging?
[107:31.50]Why did I say ranging?
[107:32.48]Okay.
[107:39.23]Broke out?
[107:40.65]Oh, what is this?
[107:41.21]Ooh, nice.
[107:41.69]Okay, cool.
[107:43.07]So, wait.
[107:43.55]Hold on.
[107:48.87]This game's cute.
[107:51.17]This is cute game.
[107:59.87]Oh, alright.
[108:04.91]Are you still streaming tomorrow?
[108:05.81]I am not.
[108:07.33]Well, by the way, those that are trickling in, let's go over it again.
[108:11.25]So, I have to... I've been trying to figure out how I'm going to do this.
[108:15.83]I have to sign and ship a thousand baseballs.
[108:20.81]And it's time to do that.
[108:23.35]So... What we're doing is we're doing an Omega weekend this weekend.
[108:37.09]The plan was I was going to do maybe tomorrow and Wednesday, but I said, you know what?
[108:41.15]No, I'm going to get this done.
[108:42.31]I want to get it done.
[108:44.63]I want to actually put real time into it and care.
[108:48.37]So I'm going to spend the next couple days signing, boxing, and shipping a thousand baseballs.
[108:56.86]So Friday, Saturday, Sunday, we're going to do an Omega weekend.
[109:00.82]Three days in a row.
[109:11.55]Stream the signing.
[109:12.39]That's possible, but I'm not going to guarantee that.
[109:14.65]I'm going to say that probably won't happen.
[109:16.53]Alright, do I have enough?
[109:25.46]Stream the signing.
[109:26.40]Stream the signing.
[109:27.24]I don't know.
[109:29.32]It feels odd to me.
[109:30.22]I don't want to do that.
[109:31.98]I have a lot of these.
[109:39.50]Okay, I have a criticism.
[109:42.75]If the devs are watching... I like it when it goes like... And it shows the amount that I added.
[109:51.20]Like, when it... I want it to be like... You know what I mean?
[109:56.22]Because when I use one of these in the menu, it's just kind of like... Yeah.
[110:05.19]I used it.
[110:08.75]It doesn't show that like on the bottom or something.
[110:11.79]It says like the amount that's on it, but I don't have a real time calculation.
[110:16.84]They're not watching.
[110:18.68]You told me they were.
[110:19.46]You literally said that like an hour ago.
[110:20.86]Alright, it's time to choose a weapon.
[110:32.96]This would be 60.
[110:33.30]This is a B. It's not this one.
[110:38.70]It's probably this, or... What would that be?
[110:42.05]48?
[110:42.75]Is it the Claws, or is it the Falchion?
[110:50.77]The Claws are gonna have the best scaling, but... Do I like them better?
[110:53.74]Falchion or, um... Or Claws.
[111:01.54]This moveset was better, but it scales worse.
[111:04.01]Not that it matters this early.
[111:11.21]Should it be Faustione?
[111:17.73]Alright, get a poll going because I actually don't know and I'm seeing a lot of both.
[111:22.45]One for Faustione and Saber, two for Claws, and we're going to be upgrading that.
[111:25.70]Do I have a long face?
[111:31.12]Because I'm a goofy motherfucker.
[111:33.12]Do I have to answer that?
[111:47.44]One or two.
[111:48.46]One is, uh, foul-shooting saber, and two is nemesis claws.
[111:52.78]One, two.
[112:01.86]I'm afraid to alt-tab, so I can't click on it.
[112:03.75]So, hopefully you guys... Can I get an update of what the percentage is?
[112:13.27]Claws have a parry.
[112:16.13]Yeah, but... Alright, so this has a parry, but this has the cool blade tornado.
[112:20.63]It has a different damage scale?
[112:22.93]That's interesting.
[112:27.44]Falchion is winning by a lot.
[112:28.76]Okay.
[112:30.10]Oh, we didn't even look at this!
[112:32.38]Nah.
[112:36.62]Alright, so there's no way it's coming back.
[112:38.63]Congratulations, Falchion and Saber.
[112:41.51]Enjoyers.
[112:42.25]That's what we're going to upgrade, and I'm going to do it right now.
[112:46.51]There we go.
[112:46.85]Alright.
[113:01.96]So I'm going to be doing a lot more damage, I think.
[113:04.73]Looks good.
[113:06.67]Very cool.
[113:07.31]The moveset on this is good as well.
[113:11.31]Cool.
[113:11.43]Alright.
[113:13.19]I'm ready.
[113:13.85]Okay.
[113:19.76]Can you play Soma for Scare Saturdays this October?
[113:22.26]We'll do a bunch of horror stuff.
[113:28.14]I'll do a lot of horror stuff this month coming up.
[113:33.06]We'll get a list.
[113:40.62]That move is so good.
[113:41.46]It takes almost the whole stamina bar, but it kills almost anything in one hit.
[113:48.15]Will you do Halloween Movie Night?
[113:51.37]If I can find some more public domain horror movies, yeah.
[113:54.55]They have to be public domain.
[114:00.05]Alright, let's get the... Where are we going here?
[114:01.93]Yeah, this way.
[114:16.96]Oh, that came out far...
[114:29.98]That move is so good.
[114:39.23]There's a combo with the R2.
[114:40.31]That's pretty good.
[114:51.35]You know, I really do wonder.
[114:53.15]I genuinely probably should look into this.
[114:55.47]I wonder just how much money it would cost.
[114:58.33]What the cost effectiveness kind of ratio there would be to like how much this cost to how fun we could have on stream for me to just buy the licensing streaming rights to be able to show a movie on stream for a night.
[115:11.76]It can't be that expensive for some of these old movies.
[115:15.16]Right?
[115:16.58]Some of these old, old fucking movies, there's no way that it would be, you know, how much am I willing to pay for that?
[115:24.45]A lot.
[115:28.67]More than I think a lot of you guys think.
[115:31.96]Actually, go through the rights holders and be like, hey, can I stream this movie without you having a problem with it?
[115:51.99]I wonder how far that could go.
[115:54.59]Right?
[115:55.26]I wonder... How much money would it take to stream, like, Gremlins 2?
[116:00.45]Somebody was saying.
[116:01.17]I wonder what that would cost.
[116:02.01]It's, I mean, it's Warner, right?
[116:06.84]It's expensive, but not that bad.
[116:08.18]I know people that own a retro... Wait, hold on.
[116:10.58]Do you do?
[116:11.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[116:12.10]I want to alt-tab, but... Mods.
[116:15.14]Mods, find that person that just said that, that they know how that works.
[116:20.81]And I would like to question them.
[116:24.97]You know what I mean?
[116:26.37]I want to talk to them.
[116:29.24]Can we ask that person some stuff?
[116:34.20]And I want to interrogate that person.
[116:36.79]find that person because we're going to interrogate them.
[116:41.07]What do you know about getting the rights to Gremlins 2?
[116:43.11]What do you know?
[116:47.93]I know people that own a retro cinema and they do it all the time.
[116:50.49]Alright, well, maybe we could find out some info.
[116:54.68]Because I am willing, I'm not kidding around, I wish I was joking when I say this, but I'm willing to put thousands and thousands of dollars to be able to do that.
[117:02.71]I'm willing to put up money to be able to stream some old dumb horror movie that could get the stream shut down, right?
[117:13.36]Because it would have to be a license pretty much per movie.
[117:17.92]Wouldn't that be fun?
[117:20.22]Should we be like licensed movie Andy?
[117:23.20]Let's do it.
[117:23.78]Let's do it.
[117:24.22]I'm going to look into it.
[117:25.34]I'm going to get on the phone with Community Jake literally tonight.
[117:28.05]Let's see if it's possible.
[117:29.85]We'll talk to the person that has experience doing it.
[117:32.43]Because that would be really fun.
[117:35.61]Oh no.
[117:36.17]What happens if it's too fun and that's like all I want to do?
[117:39.36]Oh well, whatever.
[117:44.36]Private domain movie night.
[117:46.30]That's right.
[117:55.98]Oh, you were over here.
[117:57.58]That doesn't stagger.
[118:08.95]Too dark over here, I can't see.
[118:19.16]Yeah, let's buy the licensing rights to a bunch of old horror movies.
[118:22.98]Who cares?
[118:23.28]Movies that aren't horror movies.
[118:29.81]I mean, I wonder how much does it cost to stream a licensing deal with like three men and a baby?
[118:34.91]Is that possible?
[118:43.66]I mean, these movies are old.
[118:44.68]They're really old.
[118:45.54]They're probably on streaming services.
[118:47.14]I don't know.
[119:02.37]What about an Amazon watch party?
[119:04.39]See, I don't want to do that because that kind of like sucks.
[119:10.17]From my understanding, the way that that works is only certain people from certain regions can do it.
[119:15.91]There's a very limited amount of shows to watch and it's not me streaming it, right?
[119:21.80]Doesn't it like take over the stream and it's not like me hanging out with like a cam on, right?
[119:27.22]It's pretty limited to what you can do with it.
[119:29.64]I would rather have people be able to hang out and enjoy it.
[119:35.93]They never work either.
[119:36.67]It puts you in a mini player.
[119:40.64]No, no, no, no, no.
[119:41.54]I would want to buy one night streaming rights to some of these movies and just do it the way that we would want to do it.
[119:52.65]The VOD would have to be destroyed too.
[119:54.69]Yeah, I just wouldn't turn the VOD on.
[119:56.05]That would be a thing that people knew was going to happen, right?
[119:59.51]It's, hey, we're streaming this movie.
[120:01.47]It cost me like $14,000 to buy the rights to stream this movie per night.
[120:06.50]You're going to want to be there live because I'm not going to have a VOD.
[120:09.86]Or whatever like insane amount of money it costs.
[120:14.84]I'm afraid of this.
[120:15.38]Is there a shortcut or something?
[120:22.64]I'm afraid of going through there.
[120:28.62]Oh, hello.
[120:32.11]Wait.
[120:33.95]Hold on.
[120:38.51]Just release the audio recording of your voice.
[120:40.31]That could do that, probably.
[120:44.41]Get it sponsored.
[120:46.32]I don't think I would want to do that.
[120:50.16]Because...
[120:53.32]I would want us to be able to just say and have, just have fun and not worry about like, oh, you know, the rights holder is here.
[121:00.42]Can't talk about how like shitty that scene was, right?
[121:03.98]It's just, I'm buying the rights to stream this.
[121:06.06]That's it.
[121:08.36]Unless it was made very clear that the rights holder, that they just didn't care at all.
[121:13.09]Like you'd literally say whatever you want.
[121:14.29]You can do whatever you want.
[121:22.69]Please do it with Morbius.
[121:25.39]I do not.
[121:26.05]I do not have the capital to be able to buy the rights to stream Morbius.
[121:29.60]You're talking about potentially.
[121:31.62]I wanted to take a wild guess.
[121:33.50]It would probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to stream Morbius legally to this channel.
[121:42.35]Can you imagine if I spent like $530,000?
[121:44.33]Just liquidate everything I own to be able to stream Morbius for one night?
[121:51.84]I mean, that would be kind of funny.
[121:54.12]That would probably get a lot of press.
[121:56.88]Streamer liquidates entire net worth to stream Morbius for one night to like 2,125 people.
[122:08.03]You know what I mean?
[122:08.63]It would be like that.
[122:09.29]It would be like, oh, yeah, dude, more of these.
[122:13.11]Let's go.
[122:14.19]Like 2,110 people would show up.
[122:22.13]Alright, where's the bonfire?
[122:31.24]That would be so funny, though.
[122:39.54]I think to make that even a reality, I'm trying to think of the legal way logistically you would have to do that.
[122:46.30]I would need to make a business.
[122:47.76]I would need to make a new LLC or something, right?
[122:50.90]And I'm a movie theater.
[122:52.58]It's a, oh yes, I'm a movie theater and I'm streaming movies.
[122:56.68]And then buy the rights for my movie theater to stream to like 30 or 40,000 people with my movie theater LLC.
[123:06.17]How would this even work?
[123:18.06]Alright, I'm getting lost here.
[123:21.00]Where's the... I'm talking about being... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[123:24.58]Where am I?
[123:26.54]Wait, there's a bonfire here somewhere.
[123:33.42]See if... You should contact Warner and see if they would want to do a Gremlins movie night.
[123:38.85]I don't think... Okay, here we go.
[123:41.63]I don't think that... No, that's not going to happen.
[123:45.15]That would not happen.
[123:46.25]I mean, we would do it and it would be fun, but there's no way.
[123:50.53]It's not possible.
[123:51.79]I'm not... I am a small fry in the grand scheme of all media.
[123:59.50]That's not going to happen.
[124:04.02]I'm a small fry in the grand scheme of things.
[124:06.42]I cannot get the rights to gremlins.
[124:09.22]You know what I mean?
[124:09.98]It's not happening.
[124:10.58]Do I have any more crunchies?
[124:22.16]I do have a crunchy.
[124:22.70]See what I mean?
[124:24.39]I just used it.
[124:24.97]I want like a... And count on the bottom right.
[124:29.41]See?
[124:37.01]I'm thinking health.
[124:38.95]Or just keep going with agility.
[124:42.86]Can I do another weapon?
[124:44.34]No.
[124:47.64]What do I do?
[124:48.04]Let's do health.
[125:00.58]Can you run out of the compass?
[125:05.95]Alright, I feel like there's something going on here.
[125:07.15]But yeah, I'm trying to think of how much... Some of these old horror movies that no one really... 10 grand?
[125:21.66]20 grand?
[125:23.38]Let's be realistic.
[125:25.14]How much do you think that would really be?
[125:26.98]But then if I was going to buy the rights to stream for one night, like four or five movies, that would be a lot.
[125:38.71]Probably 4K.
[125:40.51]5K maybe.
[125:42.19]Not more than a few thousand.
[125:45.58]I wonder.
[125:49.56]The aggro range on this.
[125:50.88]Get out of here.
[125:56.42]Alright, let's get... This is definitely a boss.
[125:58.76]I have three of these keys.
[126:04.88]I wonder if I should use them.
[126:16.40]We talk about this sometimes, but something very important to know is if a movie is free to watch, it is not free to stream it.
[126:25.93]I don't have broadcasting rights to some of these properties, right?
[126:36.51]There's a huge difference between this is free to watch and this is free to broadcast.
[126:50.94]be cool though I'll look into it maybe if you use one of the platforms where you stream the ads they'll they won't care no I would need because the way that it works right on I think on Twitch is somebody can just shut the stream down they can just claim the stream they can be like nope I don't think so and just turn it off
[127:14.05]So it would have to be expressed written permission from the rights holder.
[127:18.09]So no one can just go, excuse me, turn this off.
[127:20.89]It'd be like, no, no, no.
[127:23.03]I've already been in contact with Twitch and the rights holder.
[127:25.31]This is the stream staying on.
[127:30.56]I'll look into it.
[127:31.14]I really will.
[127:36.90]I don't care.
[127:37.44]Scream it, loser.
[127:39.68]We're trying to figure out how.
[127:54.86]Oh, risky, stupid.
[127:55.66]Don't fall off the edge.
[128:02.50]They can hit each other.
[128:07.79]Shit, that's dumb.
[128:32.31]Okay, we're good.
[128:33.69]I didn't use any heals.
[128:37.87]Stream it, but make everything look like a normal stream.
[128:39.63]Have a cover of you gaming a random video game and everything.
[128:42.65]Then just play movies illegally without anyone noticing.
[128:44.81]How does that?
[128:45.29]It doesn't make any sense.
[128:49.52]What's your thought process on that?
[128:53.04]Stream with a game, but then have the movie, like what, that we switch to?
[128:58.14]So when people say that, hey, there's Twitch staff in chat, I hit a button and it goes to me playing Steel Rising.
[129:06.61]Like we got, like mom caught us.
[129:11.63]I mean, that would be funny, but I would get banned.
[129:13.49]I don't know how long.
[129:20.00]You can request to stream it for free.
[129:21.94]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[129:23.60]A lot of these talks would be, hey, can I do this?
[129:27.30]Not, hey, can I give you $25,000 to stream Gremlins 2?
[129:33.23]No, it would be like, hey, can we work something out?
[129:35.15]That will start there.
[129:42.03]You start at, hey, can I do this?
[129:43.95]And then it goes through, well, I don't think so.
[129:45.91]Not unless you decide to pay for the rights.
[129:48.25]And that's when you go.
[129:50.29]Negotiator in there, me.
[129:53.68]I'll bring that price down.
[129:56.66]How much was it?
[129:57.28]Oh, it's 25 grand?
[129:59.22]Best I can do is 16,000.
[130:00.10]And then they never answer the phone again.
[130:24.93]Does this open?
[130:26.49]Ah, that's a boss.
[130:27.99]For sure.
[130:37.98]I tried to dodge.
[130:38.75]I ran out of stamina.
[130:45.21]These guys are annoying.
[130:57.18]You're not over there.
[130:57.74]Why am I looking over there?
[131:01.10]There's no iframes!
[131:02.30]Where are the iframes?
[131:10.66]What happened?
[131:30.48]I think I just turned on my Xbox.
[131:35.22]This is not connected to the computer anymore.
[131:37.48]I just turned the Xbox on.
[131:39.46]It's in another room.
[131:42.36]See?
[131:42.86]It's still on.
[131:43.68]It's not plugged in.
[131:46.66]How did I do that?
[131:47.48]Holly, are you watching?
[131:49.49]Can you turn the Xbox off?
[131:55.52]Can you go in the other room and just turn the Xbox off?
[131:58.50]I don't know, she might not even be here.
[132:05.09]How is that even possible?
[132:17.87]Can I, shouldn't I be able to, why would that happen?
[132:21.15]I don't think she's here.
[132:27.39]Wait.
[132:28.93]No.
[132:29.87]I better not be doing anything on the Xbox.
[132:33.47]What the fuck is happening?
[132:37.89]Oh, shit.
[132:38.47]I don't know how to play with the keyboard and mouse.
[132:50.56]Okay.
[132:52.55]I have... Give me a second.
[132:54.89]I'll be right back.
[134:57.44]Yeah, that's precisely what happened, by the way.
[135:00.10]It was just on.
[135:02.60]Somebody said, thank you for your confirmation of 1000 V bucks.
[135:08.99]Okay, plugging it in.
[135:25.50]Okay.
[135:26.56]We're good.
[135:27.18]Show auto.

[135:33.62]Okay.
[135:33.90]We good?
[135:36.31]We're back?
[135:39.93]We want auto now.
[135:41.37]He's sleeping.
[135:42.59]Leave him alone.
[135:43.51]He's sleeping.
[135:47.83]What happened to my... I feel like I'm sitting in the wrong spot.
[135:52.89]it feels different oh it's because I'm off this thing okay alright let's go did I get everything in the middle
[136:25.76]Here we go.
[136:26.18]Eugene Dave Van Canson's workshop.
[136:39.58]Someone hid upstairs.
[136:41.54]I just need to find a way in from the outside.
[136:44.48]Find Monsieur Dave Van Canson.
[136:56.46]new stuff.
[137:00.31]Diane breeches.
[137:04.27]These are just better.
[137:07.17]And Diane shoes.
[137:11.81]I mean, besides the lightning resistance, these are better.
[137:13.72]I only have one hat.
[137:20.70]Okay.
[137:22.32]Monsoor.
[137:26.96]Somebody's upstairs.
[137:30.98]Well, I'm not going that way.
[137:35.14]Bergenworth.
[137:36.20]Bergenworth.
[137:38.62]Scumbags.
[137:40.10]Just bastards.
[137:41.63]Blood-crazed people.
[137:55.83]Shut up.
[137:57.19]You don't know what that is?
[137:59.17]If you don't know what that is, then... I mean... You're watching this game?
[138:08.54]No, Bergenworth, not Burgah Boy.
[138:13.30]Burgah Boy, Burgah Boy.
[138:16.26]Blood-crazed bastard.
[138:22.37]Uh, alright.
[138:23.59]I can...
[138:25.84]I have three keys.
[138:27.04]What does this do?
[138:34.05]Because I can upgrade this slot.
[138:37.03]Is this a bad idea?
[138:38.63]Or should I just start with the four slots first?
[138:42.03]Don't do that.
[138:43.93]Oh, right.
[138:45.69]I have a tier two.
[138:48.46]I'm doing it.
[138:48.84]Okay, now what?
[139:00.77]Okay, so this is Tier 2.
[139:02.06]Alright.
[139:03.30]Grade 2.
[139:05.18]Stable charging and Grade 2 efficient charging.
[139:09.42]This module moderately increases balance during charged attacks.
[139:12.95]What does that mean?
[139:16.05]This module moderately increases the physical damage caused by a successful fully charged attack.
[139:21.71]What is balance?
[139:23.61]What is that?
[139:23.98]Is it poise?
[139:30.05]It's like kind of like super armor.
[139:37.83]Balance is poised.
[139:38.65]Alright.
[139:39.03]I'll keep up.
[139:39.53]I'll try it.
[139:40.44]Why not?
[139:45.20]Alright, let's go.
[139:47.48]Poise.
[139:48.12]Alright.
[139:49.84]I feel like there's a boss.
[139:51.14]So let me get rid of the souls that I don't want.
[139:53.85]Wait, can I level up again?
[140:02.54]No, so let's spend these so I don't lose them if I die.
[140:04.93]Hold on, what about equipment?
[140:14.09]Can I buy something else?
[140:19.72]This is sell, right?
[140:21.34]Am I crazy?
[140:24.98]Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[140:28.34]Wait a minute.
[140:31.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[140:33.06]What?
[140:33.48]What?
[140:34.62]Hold on.
[140:34.84]There's a whole... Wait, I can... There's a whole menu of items.
[140:40.42]What is this?
[140:45.12]Glass core batons?
[140:48.74]How come I didn't see this?
[140:53.58]What is that?
[140:54.78]Halberd?
[140:56.56]Thank God I didn't really care about any of this.
[140:58.90]Although this seems kind of cool.
[141:01.05]What's this thing?
[141:04.95]15 armor?
[141:05.31]Hmm.
[141:09.93]Should I get the hood?
[141:20.26]This is worse.
[141:20.82]3 armor?
[141:22.74]Yeah, these are worse.
[141:26.84]But hold on, I can buy modules.
[141:30.06]This mod just slightly increases armor and balance when her health is low.
[141:35.76]But that seems amazing.
[141:38.94]Oh, that's even better.
[141:39.76]I want this one.
[141:40.26]I don't know.
[141:49.93]Who gives a shit about this?
[141:55.11]More endurance.
[141:57.63]Alright, let's do it.
[141:58.38]It's time.
[141:58.72]Let's see if I can beat the boss first try.
[142:03.96]You're looking fresh.
[142:04.52]Do you have any favorite insects?
[142:06.06]Uh, dragonflies, earwigs, and... Um... What was the question?
[142:15.41]I don't remember.
[142:19.90]The factories.
[142:20.72]I want to go this way first.
[142:30.96]It wants me to go that way, but not yet.
[142:33.08]This is just a easy shortcut back here.
[142:42.60]You don't really need.
[142:50.17]Earwigs, yeah, earwigs are cool.
[142:53.91]They get a bad rap.
[142:55.83]They're funny, they're cute, they're harmless.
[143:06.16]Are they a pest?
[143:07.00]Oh, they're a pest.
[143:09.16]You're a pest.
[143:28.33]Someone said, he's aggressive.
[143:29.61]He's getting aggressive.
[143:51.14]Not gonna hit me with that shit.
[144:08.01]Hop up there and deal with this bozo.
[144:10.53]Oh shit, hold on.
[144:40.83]Baby earwigs eat each other's poop
[144:47.23]I don't think you know just how gross a lot of stuff in the animal kingdom is.
[145:09.64]Up that way, I think.
[145:11.14]No, this way.
[145:13.31]investigate wait hold on there's somebody dead up there wait can I go that way how do I get up there investigate the death of the dolphin alright ow
[145:51.62]I climb a bookcase or something.
[145:56.93]Ladders don't work.
[146:02.41]What have I done OK?
[146:08.51]How do I get up here?
[146:09.13]It has to be a way in there from somewhere outside, right?
[146:33.57]There are worms in your skin.
[146:34.71]There are not.
[146:36.29]It's an outlandish thing to say.
[146:42.32]That's truly outlandish.
[146:44.96]You're making no sense.
[146:47.98]You can't freak me out with something like that.
[146:49.62]Sorry.
[146:52.77]I can't get up there.
[147:00.80]It looks like that way, but I don't think I can get up there that way.
[147:14.29]Yeah, look.
[147:16.43]How do I get up there?
[147:17.09]I don't understand.
[147:29.06]Oh.
[147:30.63]Cool!
[147:30.75]Spent all that time.
[147:49.21]How much for a bottle of your hair oil?
[147:51.93]One hundred million dollars.
[147:54.89]In USD.
[147:57.14]In United States dollars.
[147:59.54]U.S.
[148:00.28]cash.
[148:02.04]Not an IOU.
[148:03.80]Not like a, oh, I'll do a bank transfer.
[148:06.36]No, I want it like two lawyers present.
[148:09.58]And I want it to be signed that I want a hundred million dollars.
[148:12.48]U.S.
[148:12.78]cash.
[148:13.78]Money.
[148:14.54]Real, just money.
[148:16.58]Cash in a briefcase type shit.
[148:29.66]How do I know that you'll give me the oil?
[148:31.32]I'll do it at the meeting.
[148:36.12]I got a lawyer on my side.
[148:37.26]You got a lawyer on your side.
[148:38.38]And now we'll do it there.
[149:00.15]I hope you have one for your movie stream.
[149:05.84]I'm gonna figure that out.
[149:06.92]I'm gonna use a law firm.
[149:17.49]I'm gonna use my trusted law firm.
[149:20.06]Gonzo and Gonzo.
[149:49.83]It's funny, to get the rights to have Gonzo be my lawyer would probably cost more money than just showing up without a shirt on to the meeting and have sunglasses and have a bad sunburn all over me and be in a bathing suit and be like, here's 20 grand.
[150:09.76]It would cost more money to do it the other way.
[150:16.31]Gonzo as a lawyer would be like $100,000.
[150:21.26]Forget that.
[150:24.78]I can literally just show up without a lawyer and just give them a check for 20 grand.
[150:27.94]It would be less money.
[150:31.44]Why would you have no shirt on?
[150:32.50]Because I came to the beach.
[150:56.92]Why is he getting naked at the beach?
[150:58.34]What are you talking about?
[150:59.24]I said, I said I have no shirt with a bathing suit and like a sunburn and sunglasses.
[151:07.75]Like I just came from the beach.
[151:15.43]I like a towel over my shoulder.
[151:18.73]Let's get this deal done, man.
[151:20.17]Let's go.
[151:21.00]No, I'm not naked.
[151:21.82]Stop saying naked.
[151:22.66]That's weird.
[151:23.08]What are you talking about?
[151:31.88]Why were you at the beach?
[151:33.80]Because it was relaxing before a stressful period.
[151:38.26]I don't know.
[151:38.78]I'm saying like it would be so casual instead of having to hire Gonzo for a 500 grand.
[151:51.35]I used to show up with a tank top and like it like long socks.
[151:56.57]Dad socks.
[152:00.03]I would slide through their, uh, through like the lobby.
[152:11.62]Were you at the beach with Gonzo?
[152:13.18]No!
[152:19.97]This way.
[152:22.57]I thought I missed it and I was gonna be pissed.
[152:34.89]Whoa, don't Mario this.
[152:36.31]OK.
[152:47.46]Nothing else in here.
[152:50.42]Wait, what's this?
[153:03.89]Two down here.
[153:05.03]Well, two down here.
[153:06.09]Two, two, two.
[153:09.47]Off.
[153:10.03]Off.
[153:10.69]Alright.
[153:11.91]Got it.
[153:12.05]Got it.
[153:12.19]Got it.
[153:12.33]Got it.
[153:12.51]Got it.
[153:14.25]Jesus.
[153:15.59]Didn't I just make that way more exciting?
[153:28.29]Ooh.
[153:29.73]What's that?
[153:35.84]This increases health.
[153:39.82]I have that on.
[153:43.02]Never mind.
[153:50.47]This has got 35 armor.
[153:52.05]Why is this so much better than everything else?
[153:58.79]That endurance gain is terrible.
[154:01.23]This thing's so much better.
[154:01.97]It's 20?
[154:10.15]It's Lady Dimitrescu.
[154:13.31]I'll put it on just for fun, I guess.
[154:19.38]This is better.
[154:20.08]OK, cool.
[154:22.46]It's for style.
[154:25.54]I see.
[154:34.45]Getting a lot of flame resistant stuff.
[154:51.53]Wait, am I in that house?
[154:54.91]I am in that house.
[154:58.97]Alright.
[155:07.64]Oh!
[155:42.11]That was a slash dash and you fucked it up.
[155:53.10]Get it off.
[155:59.68]Okay.
[156:05.61]I'm not in that house.
[156:10.79]I will be soon.
[156:11.51]I will be very soon.
[156:22.05]Fuck dude, what was that?
[156:24.85]Oh.
[156:32.77]I think I'm supposed to fall down here.
[156:38.87]I've been unlocking these doors.
[156:39.95]I have no idea where they go.
[156:42.86]Uh.
[156:46.72]I guess this is a shortcut to... Okay, to here, but...
[156:57.73]What does this do for me?
[157:02.83]I'm going back to the bonfire.
[157:03.77]Do I have any crunchies?
[157:16.78]I do.
[157:23.18]I'm going damage.
[157:26.16]Can you react to the Nintendo Direct tomorrow?
[157:29.26]Uh, no.
[157:30.98]I'm sorry.
[157:31.52]It's like 7 a.m.
[157:33.20]It's 7 a.m.
[157:34.20]Pacific or something.
[157:35.04]It's way too early.
[157:37.66]It's 6 to 7 a.m.
[157:38.84]or something.
[157:39.32]It's not gonna happen.
[157:47.42]I need to sell some stuff.
[157:57.09]Okay, I'm gonna sell... How much do I need?
[158:03.97]Like 300?
[158:04.17]This is probably a bad idea, but whatever.
[158:30.54]Shit, I have the same problem.
[158:37.79]Oh, wait a minute.
[158:39.47]Uh... I... can do this, right?
[158:45.43]Yep.
[158:45.77]Okay, so this is more health.
[158:49.64]We want your reaction.
[158:51.52]I don't... There's nothing that Nintendo's coming up with that I wanted to play.
[158:55.86]I don't think there's anything I can think of.
[159:04.06]I can't think of it.
[159:04.84]I didn't do the summer games thing.
[159:08.28]Whatever it was.
[159:08.72]Or gamescom.
[159:09.40]I didn't do that either.
[159:10.06]Let me buy some bullets.
[159:21.49]Alright.
[159:22.01]Whatever I have to do.
[159:23.63]Let's try this again now.
[159:25.61]Okay.
[159:25.89]We're going this way.
[159:29.55]I think I'm close to something.
[159:32.97]I'm not going to fight.
[159:33.57]We're just going to run.
[159:36.15]Here the mobile walkway.
[159:37.35]Okay, sure thing.
[159:38.10]I think it sounds like it's going to explode.
[159:47.86]I think chasing me.
[159:51.01]Yeah, there is.
[159:52.03]Why did you chase me this whole way?
[160:04.32]How do I get over there?
[160:08.89]Oh, this way.
[160:09.39]Okay.
[160:10.25]Um, sure.
[160:17.13]Okay.
[160:20.68]Like the barnyard PC game.
[160:23.14]I don't know what that is.
[160:23.78]Shit.
[160:29.82]Shit.
[160:33.95]Shit, how do I get over here?
[160:34.85]Can you please play Sly Cooper?
[160:49.04]That's where I draw the line.
[160:50.47]I'm sorry, that's where I draw the line.
[160:51.63]I don't know where to go.
[161:05.18]This way.
[161:10.34]I was up on that walkway before.
[161:11.90]How do I get up there?
[161:13.73]God damn it.
[161:22.57]I don't know.
[161:26.12]Is this correct?
[161:26.80]I hope so.
[161:31.18]Yeah, okay.
[161:31.82]So then from here...
[161:35.82]I go this way, right?
[161:38.73]Yes.
[161:39.61]Yes.
[162:56.77]Sorry, I was muted.
[162:58.39]So I think it's right there.
[163:00.29]Weird.
[163:00.74]Okay, wait, what the fuck?
[163:03.52]How do I get over there?
[163:07.40]Clearly there's a staircase right there, but how do I get over here?
[163:09.58]What the hell?
[163:15.87]This is confusing.
[163:22.47]Can I jump out of this?
[163:28.99]How do I get over here?
[163:36.96]Okay, this takes me all the way back around again.
[163:38.98]But then... I... I don't get this.
[163:48.32]What the hell?
[163:48.76]How am I lost in a game with a quest marker?
[163:56.56]Do you understand that there's literally one fucking way to get over here?
[164:00.10]And it's like up down these stairs and then down those stairs and then left out of that and then down those stairs and then around those stairs and through that door.
[164:05.76]It's not like I can't just walk straight.
[164:31.65]You need to put you in a box with four buttons to win.
[164:34.40]There are four buttons.
[164:47.27]There's nothing up here.
[165:24.05]Help!
[165:35.61]Is that it right there?
[165:36.29]Is that it right there?
[165:38.85]Can I go in there into the right?
[165:42.11]Prepare the walkway.
[165:46.41]It's up there.
[165:48.38]Is it not there?
[165:48.94]I just got here.
[165:54.46]Is the game good?
[165:55.08]It was.
[165:56.58]Still about 15 minutes to go.
[166:16.45]No, this is not right.
[166:20.41]I go down from here.
[166:22.09]No, this is not right.
[166:24.07]It is that door.
[166:24.85]It has to be right.
[166:26.25]What is this?
[166:34.16]This is that door, so let's go through here and then to the.
[166:39.84]We're up here.
[166:45.18]I can't get... How do I get out of here?
[166:50.40]How do I get out of here?
[166:55.81]Be honest.
[166:56.43]How do I get the fuck out of this maze?
[166:59.39]How do I get over there?
[167:02.43]How come you're doing this to us?
[167:05.19]Tell me where to go!
[167:05.95]Just tell me where to go!
[167:08.29]How do I go that way?
[167:18.38]Like, in this building?
[167:19.50]But I can't, how am I supposed to do that?
[167:20.92]I was already up there.
[167:23.90]No help.
[167:24.64]No, no, no.
[167:25.68]Yes, help.
[167:26.84]Yes, help me.
[167:56.57]Go the other way.
[167:57.77]There is no other way.
[167:59.53]There's no other way.
[168:01.69]There's only this way.
[168:09.66]I have to go in there.
[168:10.92]I have to go in there and up and then straight.
[168:12.56]I have to.
[168:13.02]There's no other way to go.
[168:13.92]No!
[168:20.18]Okay, I'm fine.
[168:22.47]And then up.
[168:26.78]Up and then across is the only way.
[168:28.48]I can't go up from here.
[168:31.07]I have to go down and then... How do I get up there?
[168:52.68]How do I get up there?
[168:53.58]I'm serious.
[168:57.84]Bro, somebody help me.
[169:00.27]I genuinely don't understand how to get up there.
[169:04.79]Go to the factory port.
[169:06.31]That door... I missed it.
[169:11.86]Go to the port by sliding off the roof.
[169:14.62]Okay, the port.
[169:17.84]The port?
[169:19.50]That's over here.
[169:28.06]Okay, I'm going to go to the port.
[169:31.62]Go to the part where you slide off the roof.
[169:34.08]I've slidden off the fuck off.
[169:36.52]God damn.
[169:37.20]Oh, this.
[169:37.76]Okay, let's go this way.
[169:38.81]God, I'm trying to... The quest marker actually was a detriment to the game.
[169:51.87]It's telling me to go that way.
[169:55.37]Whatever.
[169:55.93]You get it.
[169:57.17]You understand.
[169:57.73]I've been trying to follow the quest marker.
[170:00.10]This is walking away from the quest marker.
[170:01.96]You told me, oh yeah, why do you get a quest marker?
[170:03.90]How can you get it wrong?
[170:04.94]Because the quest marker was wrong to tell me to go that way.
[170:10.54]I'm thinking I'm trying to traverse that way to go... Whatever.
[170:18.38]You didn't even see this.
[170:19.31]Everyone was telling me to go in the building.
[170:21.79]You didn't see it either.
[170:22.85]Liars.
[170:31.58]There's no way.
[170:33.11]It was the game's fault.
[170:33.79]It was.
[170:34.25]This was the game's fault.
[170:37.09]Worst gamer moment?
[170:37.99]No, it's not.
[170:38.81]Please.
[170:39.73]It is absolutely not the worst gamer moment.
[170:41.59]Not even close.
[170:44.84]Because I was following instructions.
[170:46.78]I followed directions.
[171:02.51]Oh, you didn't, okay.
[171:04.99]What's the compass say?
[171:14.60]Yeah, fine.
[171:15.16]Okay, so how about this?
[171:16.20]Yeah, you guys took our worst gamer moment.
[171:18.13]How about best gamer moment?
[171:19.87]Every time I get hit by the boss, I will eat a hot dog.
[171:23.51]Each hit from the boss is one hot dog.
[171:27.35]I'm fucking kidding.
[171:28.01]That's not happening.
[171:29.21]I'm not doing that.
[171:36.07]Not a chance in hell that happens.
[171:38.17]Not happening.
[171:42.67]It's too late.
[171:43.26]No, I'm sorry.
[171:43.80]I didn't.
[171:44.20]My hand was out and I went like this.
[171:49.80]What did I pick up?
[171:52.58]What did I pick up?
[171:54.57]How come it's not showing me what I pick up sometimes?
[172:04.91]Yeah, I went like this, and you went to shake my hand, and I went... Sorry.
[172:12.66]You got baited.
[172:13.16]Okay, I got a lot of bullets.
[172:52.50]So many lies.
[172:53.32]Sit up straight.
[172:58.35]There.
[173:00.21]Okay, so now... I'm not gonna go that way just yet.
[173:07.55]This looks interesting.
[173:20.82]Why are your eyes closer together today?
[173:24.56]They are?
[173:24.86]Um... Wait, is that a shortcut?
[173:40.76]I thought I was going in the water.
[173:43.32]Okay, thank god.
[173:50.22]So where the hell is this?
[173:55.68]This is a shitty shortcut.
[173:58.43]Yeah, this shortcut's awful.
[174:04.15]This is a shitty shortcut.
[174:23.05]No, sorry, we're not, we're not, we're not doing... Look at, look at, and look at all these, look at all these Ball Fondler Andes.
[174:31.46]Whoa, what's the hot dog stream?
[174:33.28]Mmm, yeah, all the Ball Fondler Andes think they're gonna get the spotlight here.
[174:36.48]Sorry.
[174:37.52]Nope.
[174:44.23]I'm really trying to get that spotlight.
[174:57.09]Alright.
[175:18.37]I'm slowly processing what just happened.
[175:21.03]All these Ball Fondler Andes?
[175:24.52]That's... Out of context, that's a little strange.
[175:31.44]And it's the hot dog stream.
[175:33.12]All the Ball Fondler Andes.
[175:34.74]What is that supposed to mean?
[175:35.78]That I'm... I'm confusing myself.
[175:43.91]They think they're going to get the spotlight.
[175:47.94]Thank you.
[176:07.31]Let Balfondler go.
[176:08.47]Balfondler has been unbanned for almost a month.
[176:14.29]What are you talking about?
[176:15.17]You have a very rectangular forehead.
[176:30.92]Yeah, when I go like this, it's like a fucking hammerhead.
[176:34.92]OK, I made it to the forge.
[176:51.20]Uh oh.
[176:53.85]Boss time.
[176:54.85]Uh oh boss fight.
[177:47.60]The strat still works!
[178:11.25]Should have taken the bet.
[178:21.88]Should have taken the bet.
[178:23.74]There's still time for me to shake your hand.
[178:29.04]This weapon is too good.
[178:31.00]It's so good.
[178:33.07]There's no diminishing returns on this.
[178:55.50]Should've taken that bet.
[178:57.70]Jeez Andy.
[178:58.70]Alright, should I not use that anymore?
[179:00.50]It's not fair if I use that anymore.
[179:04.92]That's too good.
[179:05.72]It's probably going to get patched.
[179:08.72]One hot dog?
[179:09.42]I didn't get hit once.
[179:11.88]That's going to get patched.
[179:13.74]That's going to get patched out of the game.
[179:21.27]When did I get hit.
[179:21.99]I didn't get hit once.
[179:35.21]Look at your health.
[179:37.13]It was like that already.
[179:37.89]It was already at minus like 10%.
[179:39.51]Alright, I have no more cheese.
[179:44.59]I won't do any more cheese strats.
[179:45.74]It's just too good.
[179:46.34]I cheesed the last two.
[179:55.30]I cheesed the last two bosses in a row.
[180:00.76]And that's with no points.
[180:02.72]Okay, if you play the alchemy class and you get this weapon, you'll just... You could literally just kill everybody.
[180:16.89]I won't cheese the bosses anymore.
[180:18.17]The next boss, I will not cheese.
[180:18.81]I will not cheese it, I promise.
[180:20.35]I will fight it regularly.
[180:35.80]Hold on, is there anything else here?
[180:41.47]That's gonna get patched.
[180:51.90]What is attacking me from somewhere?
[180:58.14]They'll add some type of bosses cannot be frozen more than once or twice like in a row or something, right?
[181:10.54]Ketchup or mustard?
[181:11.76]Mustard.
[181:12.42]Harder than the boss.
[181:18.67]Am I going to die?
[181:49.22]What is he doing?
[181:49.78]Alright, did I miss anything down here?
[182:16.33]Who?
[182:25.80]OK.
[182:29.54]That way.
[182:32.82]Yellow mustard.
[182:33.40]Yeah, I don't really like yellow mustard.
[182:36.13]I do like.
[182:36.81]Brown mustard in a ground mustard.
[182:41.77]Very good.
[182:46.89]Alright, I can upgrade this again.
[182:48.25]I need 3000 souls.
[182:50.33]That's a lot.
[182:57.76]Ground mustard.
[183:01.58]Like ground, stone ground mustard.
[183:08.47]I'm not going to use this.
[183:14.55]Fight or flight?
[183:16.69]Physical damage and impact when her health is at its lowest.
[183:21.43]Or.
[183:24.92]I mean, that's the frost.
[183:29.26]I'm sorry, the children in the chat don't like real mustard.
[183:33.73]I think a lot of people here do.
[183:47.37]That's part of the secret recipe though.
[183:58.46]I already did this.
[183:59.44]Let's keep going.
[184:07.89]Seems cute.
[184:10.91]Alright.
[184:12.93]We are about to repair the walkway.
[184:20.48]You're a corporate honey Dijon spy.
[184:24.72]I like honey mustard, but I prefer stone ground.
[184:28.18]I like the little pebbles.
[184:34.94]Is this sponsored?
[184:35.62]No.
[184:37.57]I would have to tell you.
[184:40.79]I'm just playing it because I told you it looks fun.
[184:44.05]It is fun.
[184:46.11]I would not play this game for three hours if I didn't think it was fun.
[184:56.05]I just gotta stop being a cheese ball and fight the bosses for real.
[185:01.91]Alright, so that opened this.
[185:26.85]I like this game too.
[185:27.61]Yeah, it's fine.
[185:28.53]It's good.
[185:30.63]I think it's good.
[185:32.25]I think it'll scratch some of that itch.
[185:44.94]Oh wait, hold on.
[185:48.22]Why did you turn around?
[185:53.46]That's pretty good.
[185:57.30]Get the free hits.
[186:10.69]Using the OP weapon isn't cheese.
[186:12.11]That's just the game.
[186:14.21]Yeah, but I have... Okay, I have not dodged a boss's attack in two and a half hours.
[186:21.97]That's a fact.
[186:35.34]Increases immobilization.
[186:37.08]Oh, that's kind of good.
[186:39.36]Actually, I like what I have better.
[186:48.45]Alright.
[186:50.23]Oh, this works now.
[186:55.65]Just in case I miss an item.
[186:57.41]Which I don't think I'm going to.
[186:58.29]Okay, we're good.
[187:09.57]My friend's watching your stream for the first time.
[187:11.22]He said, stop making Rick and Morty jokes.
[187:18.70]Oh, that's not very schwifty of your friend, is it?
[187:23.52]Sorry.
[187:32.09]I have 31 frost grenades?
[187:35.93]Wait, no, I'm purchasing.
[187:45.99]Well, your friend is now never going to watch a stream ever again.
[187:53.78]Why are you such a dad?
[187:54.76]You like to make chat fringe.
[188:00.20]It's fun.
[188:00.60]It'll be fun.
[188:02.84]Am I in 60 FPS?
[188:03.26]Yeah.
[188:03.59]Okay.
[188:05.75]That's it.
[188:15.08]I have this guy's hair.
[188:15.62]All of a sudden there are dialog options?
[188:47.72]There are machines wreaking havoc on the Esplanade.
[188:51.30]So I saw, yes, and a little too closely for my liking.
[188:55.44]It's a miracle I escaped alive.
[188:57.58]Just by Les Invalides, I saw one take a volley of gunfire, halt for an instant, then carry on as if nothing happened.
[189:04.80]But no machine, however resilient, is indestructible.
[189:08.82]These automats must have a weakness, some vital axle or gear that we can target.
[189:14.30]I don't suppose you would know, you who share their nature.
[189:17.47]No.
[189:18.21]Blast.
[189:19.25]That is unfortunate.
[189:20.73]I scoured the workshop hoping to shed some light on the matter, but to no avail.
[189:28.36]There are machines wreaking havoc on the Esplanade.
[189:31.95]So I saw, yes, and a little too closely for my liking.
[189:36.09]It's a miracle I escaped alive.
[189:38.19]Just by Les Invalides, I saw one take a volley of gunfire, halt for an instant, then carry on as if nothing happened.
[189:45.46]But no machine, however resilient, is indestructible.
[189:49.42]These automats must have a weakness, some vital axle or gear that we can target.
[189:54.96]I don't suppose you would know.
[189:56.08]Why are we doing this again?
[189:57.12]Yeah, this is okay.
[189:58.14]No.
[189:58.82]Wait, why are we doing this again?
[190:01.40]I scoured the workshop hoping to shed some light on the matter.
[190:05.18]Wasn't that different dialog?
[190:07.20]Wait, this was different dialog.
[190:08.84]There are machines.
[190:10.26]Oh, no.
[190:11.35]Just by these automats, some vital... I don't suppose you would know.
[190:15.75]No.
[190:16.33]Blast.
[190:17.15]I scared... Okay, so let me... Hold on.
[190:21.19]So...
[190:22.88]I was watching a YouTube video the other night, and that was weird.
[190:27.16]I would cut to you, like, as if I'm talking to this guy, but whatever.
[190:30.05]We'll just... That's fine.
[190:31.55]I was...
[190:34.34]I guess I'll just not look at the screen.
[190:36.62]Okay, so I was watching a YouTube video the other night, and I may have been high.
[190:41.46]I may have been relaxing, and I may have been a little high on THC marijuana.
[190:47.47]And so this video started... I was searching for a gameplay video, and I got a video game video that I was looking for.
[190:56.39]And in the middle, like two minutes into this video, there was... Ah, I hate this.
[191:01.88]I'm just going to go like this.
[191:04.32]Two minutes into this video, there was an ad.
[191:08.24]You know, like, oh, by the way, this video is sponsored by this.
[191:13.72]And it was for a different game.
[191:16.01]So it was a video game video.
[191:18.29]And then it went into this...
[191:20.11]kind of, hey, here's an ad for another game.
[191:23.45]And it was so long to me that I was like, why did I click on this?
[191:30.65]This game that I don't fucking care about.
[191:32.86]Why did I open this video?
[191:34.16]I was so high.
[191:34.74]I was just like, why did I do this?
[191:36.82]This is not the video.
[191:37.84]Did I search for this?
[191:39.78]And I forgot the actual reason why I watched the first video.
[191:44.49]I forgot the reason why I opened the video in the first place, so I just left.
[191:47.47]I was like, I don't... What's happening?
[191:51.35]And then I forgot the video.
[191:53.62]I wanted to go search for it again.
[191:54.90]I forgot what I was looking for.
[192:02.98]What a stoner.
[192:04.84]Hey, you can... You can, um...
[192:10.86]It's called being high.
[192:11.86]Yeah, I'm just... I was so confused though.
[192:14.80]I really was... Why did I open this video?
[192:18.23]I've done that while sober.
[192:37.27]Well, because the ad was so long in the video.
[192:40.79]And it was for another video game on a video game video.
[192:47.04]I just like, there's no, why am I here?
[192:49.28]I had to have clicked this.
[192:51.52]I had to have searched for this.
[192:55.22]Your creator?
[192:56.69]Well, that makes two of us.
[192:58.73]If only I had listened to the abbot.
[193:00.81]I must attend to a matter of the...
[193:09.80]I don't know if anybody cared, but you can do it on your playthrough.
[193:19.16]Wait, somebody died?
[193:30.13]What the fuck?
[193:42.20]New zone!
[194:10.06]You get to drive the carriage.
[194:12.73]That would... That's a full letter grade.
[194:22.27]Okay.
[194:23.13]Travel.
[194:24.27]Eugene de Vacanson's horseless carriage allows Aegis to travel around Paris.
[194:29.36]In addition, thanks to the equipment on board, she can do the same things she can in a vestal.
[194:33.44]Okay.
[194:34.18]Equipped with messengers, allowing Aegis to receive and reply to letters from her allies.
[194:46.43]Turn the fucking Xbox on again.
[194:47.85]Yeah.
[195:01.36]Just unplug.
[195:06.71]I can't unplug it.
[195:07.65]Look, it's on.
[195:13.16]The Xbox is far away.
[195:15.26]Let me make that clear.
[195:16.82]It is far away.
[195:17.95]It's across my entire place.
[195:22.21]Use a wired controller.
[195:23.83]I'm wired.
[195:25.21]I'm plugged in with a wire to the computer.
[195:27.43]Just unplug the Xbox.
[195:30.36]Oh, thank you.
[195:36.38]I think Holly may have turned it off.
[195:42.94]It's unplugged in with a wire.
[195:44.15]Okay, there we go.
[195:49.33]Alright, travel.
[195:53.01]Whoa.
[195:53.59]Where should I go?
[195:58.27]What's correspondence?
[196:00.57]Oh, who cares?
[196:03.89]Where should I go?
[196:07.84]Main quest is La City and the Tuileries.
[196:12.92]Thank you, Holly.
[196:14.92]That scared the shit out of me.
[196:18.02]Wait, Holly, were you in the room?
[196:20.16]Did the Xbox just turn on?
[196:21.60]Did the TV turn on?
[196:22.70]Was I pressing buttons?
[196:25.20]That scared the shit out of me.
[196:26.18]Where should I go?
[196:32.67]La City or Tula Riz?
[196:37.23]This game looks kind of good.
[196:41.44]It is.
[196:42.36]I think it's fun.
[196:48.75]Really, really... The bosses are kind of easy.
[196:52.71]But that's the kind of character I'm playing.
[196:55.23]If I was a strength character, I bet you I'd be having a lot more trouble.
[197:01.01]I kept hearing the little...
[197:10.16]uh okay uh where should I go take the batteries out of the controller now that's a brilliant idea that's actually a smart idea honest to god that's the smartest thing I've ever heard oh wait can I oh does that still work I'm gonna go to lust city
[198:02.88]God, I wish you were real.
[198:05.78]You smoking crack again?
[198:06.74]It's pronounced sitay.
[198:21.63]Ooh, I like this area.
[198:32.15]Wait, let me do the E3 walk.
[198:35.65]It's very specific.
[198:44.87]I almost got it.
[199:03.99]I hope there's an enemy here.
[199:05.37]Yep.
[199:07.81]Shit, I made the game look like shit!
[199:09.87]I'm sorry, don't fire me!
[199:21.20]I do like this area, though.
[199:33.39]It's definitely not.
[199:34.23]Yeah.
[199:34.97]What am I talking about?
[199:38.41]Do it again with music.
[199:43.73]Less hellies.
[199:49.13]I need souls.
[199:50.15]I need to upgrade this weapon.
[199:54.94]Dogs are too fast for that.
[200:00.20]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[200:06.00]Did the other one die?
[200:10.16]Oh, they explode.
[200:13.50]Okay.
[200:13.72]I like the fire effects in this game.
[200:15.10]Something in my eye.
[200:39.15]Tricky area.
[200:43.57]Tried it.
[200:43.83]Are you going to replay Sekiro?
[200:49.93]Um... I'd rather punch myself in the face.
[200:57.38]Square in the nose.
[200:58.52]Than play through Sekiro again.
[201:00.76]If I had an option...
[201:10.66]Jerma, you can punch yourself as hard as you can directly into your face, like right here.
[201:14.85]Or you have to start a new playthrough of Sekiro and get to the end.
[201:17.89]And beat the whole game.
[201:18.85]Get the true ending.
[201:19.49]I go now.
[201:20.51]Can I do it now?
[201:25.91]You hate Sekiro?
[201:26.91]No, I don't hate Sekiro.
[201:28.07]It's just fucking impossibly difficult.
[201:31.55]I've gone back to it before in the last, since beating it.
[201:34.33]I just go, no, no.
[201:37.31]Why am I doing this?
[201:38.31]What's the point of me playing this?
[201:47.58]I cannot come up with a reason to play Sekiro again.
[201:52.36]That is the hardest game I've ever played.
[201:56.12]And yes, I had the same thing.
[201:57.36]Oh, you know what?
[201:58.38]Maybe I'll play Sekiro again.
[201:59.40]That sounds kind of like fun.
[202:00.51]Yeah, it's like really tough and parries.
[202:02.75]That's such a fun game.
[202:04.95]And you get to the first boss fight.
[202:06.89]You get to Lady Butterfly or the big guy, the big drunk guy.
[202:12.29]And you go, what am I doing here?
[202:16.83]I could play Mario Party.
[202:17.91]You know what I mean?
[202:19.93]No, I don't want to do that.
[202:25.07]I could do anything else.
[202:26.59]Skill issue?
[202:27.96]That drunk guy fight, where you have to fight 15 people and him at the same time, it's just like, why am I playing this?
[202:35.42]There's no reason for me to do this right now.
[202:39.27]I've done that twice.
[202:40.05]Alright, let me pay attention, please, before I lose.
[202:53.06]He's kicking my ass.
[202:57.33]Double?
[202:58.05]Swing?
[203:00.25]Alright.
[203:00.99]I've been hit by you than any of the bosses in the game.
[203:03.98]Alright.
[203:04.50]Skill issue.
[203:04.96]Let's go.
[203:17.76]quiet up there.
[203:22.63]Can I even get up there?
[203:28.64]I can't, so whatever.
[203:29.48]Screw it.
[203:54.13]so I can fight you.
[203:56.21]Jesus.
[204:03.39]I dodged the other way.
[204:16.19]Yeah, the me strong playthrough.
[204:17.52]I doubt it's never going to happen.
[204:18.98]I just don't think it will.
[204:22.47]Because it's one thing to, okay, yeah, I partake in marijuana off stream and stuff, right?
[204:30.77]But I don't, I don't know.
[204:32.19]I feel like that's, I feel like that's some kind of endorsement somehow to like, dude, hey, just like smoke weed and play games, man.
[204:42.00]Just like play game while you're high.
[204:43.36]It's so much more fun.
[204:45.44]Eh.
[204:48.42]Look at how, look at how fun this is.
[204:52.26]It's not.
[204:54.36]Yeah, I don't want to.
[204:56.26]If I ever did the me strong playthrough, I wouldn't say anything.
[204:58.99]It would just be like, guys, we're doing me strong today.
[205:02.37]And I wouldn't say anything else.
[205:06.07]But then people that are just like, why is he such as?
[205:09.97]Why is he so bad?
[205:11.53]He has to be making this up, right?
[205:13.16]There's going to be no way to hide that.
[205:30.03]Because it would be undeniable what was going on.
[205:35.37]Yeah, that's the playthrough where I make a big caveman guy and put every single point in strength and try to beat, like, get through fucking, like, like, Godrick's castle.
[205:47.38]I think I could do it.
[205:54.48]Yeah, every single point has to be in strength.
[205:56.22]Supposed to be a caveman.
[206:00.65]Alright, what am I missing something here?
[206:10.22]Then you stream drunk before.
[206:13.57]Yeah, I mean this.
[206:14.41]I don't know.
[206:16.23]I to me there's a difference in my brain or.
[206:20.14]Oh, I'm drinking on stream versus I'm drunk.
[206:23.52]It's part of the stream is me.
[206:25.44]I'm drunk.
[206:26.36]I'm drunk stream.
[206:27.82]I'm drunk and I have to play this game trashed, right?
[206:33.23]Like I could drink on stream, but it's not like part of the... Oh, yeah, it's because the stream is live.
[206:37.95]So that's why I'm drinking a lot.
[206:39.11]I don't know.
[206:42.51]How do I get up there?
[206:43.10]I don't know.
[206:44.62]Influencer Andy.
[206:45.42]Influencer Andy.
[206:48.71]I mean, I could just, it is, you know, okay, this is an 18 plus story and whatever.
[206:52.31]Mature content warning.
[206:54.23]But still, I don't want to make people think that.
[206:58.28]Dude, just like fucking get high and like play Elden Ring, man.
[207:01.74]It's like what I'm doing.
[207:03.14]You should be doing, that's what I do.
[207:04.66]Why don't you do it too?
[207:08.07]So much cooler this way.
[207:14.78]I don't know.
[207:15.08]There's probably a place to do it and not.
[207:17.54]The, like, Influencer Andy.
[207:23.57]I genuinely don't know how to get up there.
[207:43.26]Guess it's this way.
[207:46.02]Yes, it definitely is.
[207:50.25]You're an adult.
[207:50.79]Do what you want.
[207:54.59]Yeah, I know.
[207:57.47]I know I'm overthinking it.
[207:58.55]I do that a lot though.
[208:11.81]That's a Virgo.
[208:12.83]That's a Virgo behavior.
[208:13.91]I mean, I'm there.
[208:17.49]Whatever.
[208:29.27]I have a lot of those essences.
[208:30.41]It's time to crush them.
[208:37.25]Alright, there we go.
[208:48.09]Are you gonna play SCORN?
[208:49.65]What's SCORN?
[208:50.21]They're good?
[208:58.02]The movement looks fun in this game.
[209:00.92]It's very clean.
[209:02.52]However you want to look at this and talk about this, a lot of the Dark Souls kind of clone games, they all have the same problem where it feels like kind of off somehow and like clunky.
[209:16.42]This feels good to play.
[209:17.96]This feels good.
[209:20.53]I have not had a complaint at all about how the combat animations are or besides the hitboxes maybe.
[209:29.36]It's very clean.
[209:30.14]It's very polished.
[209:30.92]Put it that way.
[209:31.48]It's a polished game.
[209:34.02]I know I did crash out, but you know what I'm saying.
[209:38.96]Oh my fucking god.
[209:40.08]That guy just killed me.
[209:47.15]He's letting the dev down lightly.
[209:52.55]That's not what's happening.
[210:00.40]Alright, that's the... Look at how many souls I have!
[210:02.82]What the hell is going on?
[210:03.70]I have a lot.
[210:08.81]Oh my god, I'm bad.
[210:09.75]This reminds me of a 360 game in a good way.
[210:25.66]I know what you mean by that.
[210:29.86]I know what that means.
[210:30.57]Damn it, I had enough and I just blew it.
[210:40.85]Wait, how many points do I have?
[210:42.94]Shit.
[210:43.04]That was stupid.
[210:49.48]Actually, I might have enough.
[210:52.36]Do I have enough?
[210:52.92]2,000?
[210:52.94]Is it 2,000 or 3,000 to upgrade the weapon?
[211:00.63]Shit.
[211:00.91]Alright, I'll just farm for a sec.
[211:09.64]Your face is blocking the souls.
[211:11.20]Why did it take you that long for someone to tell me this?
[211:14.22]I can't alt tab, though.
[211:16.04]I have 2,000.
[211:16.59]Can you see that anywhere?
[211:18.93]How come nobody told me this?
[211:29.85]Oh boy, you're an idiot.
[211:32.69]What was that guy doing?
[211:36.86]Let's get to 3,000 and then I can turn around.
[211:45.66]Okay, hold on now.
[211:51.38]Woo!
[212:00.71]That's cool.
[212:06.23]Stop blocking me.
[212:07.01]It's not fair.
[212:18.39]I'm out of stamina already.
[212:44.77]What happened to the hamster stream?
[212:47.15]Um...
[212:48.76]To refresh people's memories, it's when I was gonna dress up with, like, ears and, like, put teeth here.
[212:53.68]And just be in a ball over there and have, like, a couple of toys and, like, one of those water, durable water things.
[213:01.98]And I was gonna eat seeds and shit, and I wasn't gonna say anything.
[213:05.12]And see how long until I lost, like, 5,000 subs.
[213:09.09]It was gonna be an experiment, but I decided against it.
[213:11.55]I was gonna have a tube I could go through between rooms and stuff.
[213:14.65]And you could give me bits to, like, drop seeds down.
[213:24.40]That turned out it was going to be too expensive.
[213:25.64]Alright, so I went this way already.
[213:36.68]This is where they came.
[213:37.46]Right?
[213:39.39]Yeah.
[213:44.51]I like the heal animation.
[213:45.83]It's cool.
[213:57.48]And I would have a bunch of made up catchphrases.
[214:01.04]When a new sub came in.
[214:06.38]I would go, oh, I sure wish I had some cheese.
[214:09.06]Thanks, what's up?
[214:12.16]And everyone would just spam laughing and shit, even though it was not funny.
[214:19.55]Hamsters don't eat cheese.
[214:25.29]Yeah, I'll be like, oh, next time, give me some chicken!
[214:32.16]And go, like, into the camera.
[214:39.93]I wonder how many people would leave.
[214:42.33]Permanently.
[214:44.45]Jeez, Dimitri!
[214:49.73]Where am I going?
[214:56.39]If the compass didn't exist, I would never have done that.
[215:00.63]Play Hamster Playground.
[215:03.52]All aboard the hamster train.
[215:05.36]Prepare for cuteness overload, relentless training, and fierce rivalry as you and your hamsters take on challenges while traversing the maze and riding a skateboard.
[215:14.45]With more modes... This is AI generated.
[215:18.15]With more modes coming soon.
[215:19.95]Be the first to cross the finish line to earn rewards and yummy treats.
[215:22.77]Experience this fierce competition in a laid-back style.
[215:26.45]You customize your hamster.
[215:31.42]While traversing the maze and riding a skateboard.
[215:37.78]You know, I don't know, I'm like doing it.
[215:39.84]Hold on.
[216:11.42]There's a cutscene.
[216:11.96]Hold on.
[216:12.34]Oh, dude!
[216:17.12]455!
[216:17.26]Thanks for the bits!
[216:18.10]I could use some cheese!
[216:18.74]There's nothing stranger than that face.
[216:19.72]Just what mission has the Marquis entrusted you with?
[216:38.31]I can't even get it to stay there.
[216:39.25]...is being held prisoner by the monstrosity that is wreaking havoc on the Ile de la Cité.
[216:57.62]But how can he possibly hope to free him?
[217:00.24]The abbot is a holy man who would lay down his life to end injustice.
[217:04.77]Okay.
[217:05.49]But there isn't one among us who stands the slightest chance against that thing.
[217:09.89]Not the slightest chance.
[217:11.23]I wonder where I go from here, though.
[217:13.21]The Palais de Justice.
[217:15.94]I can't get to stay.
[217:18.78]Don't look up in the... I almost said mirror.
[217:21.22]Don't look up and say, give me some cheese.
[217:26.28]My mouth is too watery.
[217:27.24]I can't.
[217:28.24]I'm such a greasy person.
[217:31.09]I can't get my teeth to stay there.
[217:33.85]I missed that whole cutscene.
[217:34.61]What happened?
[217:55.64]Oh, I gotta turn these in.
[217:59.85]Oh.
[217:59.93]Is that what I looked like?
[218:01.81]What the fuck?
[218:05.69]What?
[218:09.87]Jesus.
[218:10.45]I look horrible.
[218:14.07]Oh my god.
[218:14.91]It looks... I hate it.
[218:17.69]I genuinely hate that image.
[218:20.90]Ugh.
[218:22.17]It's like triggering a response.
[218:25.26]It's triggering a response.
[218:30.74]I can't alt tab.
[218:33.41]But those images are triggering a response.
[218:53.41]How are you supposed to avoid that?
[219:08.82]Block.
[219:11.48]Please show it.
[219:13.12]I will before the stream ends.
[219:17.10]Here we go.
[219:17.56]Alright, I need to upgrade the weapon.
[219:27.41]Oh, I would love some cheese.
[219:32.70]Would you guys ironically like that, though?
[219:35.18]I feel like there's a lot of people that would want me to do that because they would they go, yeah, that's that's do it.
[219:40.57]That's funny.
[219:48.97]With the ratio of the amount of people that leave the community permanently versus the amount of people that stay and give cheese bits, what's the ratio, do you think?
[220:08.79]I would legit call work off of that.
[220:10.43]No, you would not.
[220:16.68]You would fall out sick from work if I was doing the hamster with the teeth and say cheese bits and stuff.
[220:26.29]You would call off work.
[220:35.36]I would, to be honest.
[220:50.57]oh those of you that said the game was not hard enough yeah we'll wait till you get to uh right let's wait till you get to say hello wherever wherever we are I don't know what zone this is
[221:25.16]It's so unforgiving.
[221:28.18]So unforgiving.
[221:32.57]Oh, it's brutal.
[221:41.61]This game is just so unforgiving.
[221:45.93]Brutal.
[221:46.61]That's why we like it though.
[221:49.41]That's why we play them.
[221:56.12]Just wait till you get to, uh, Seattle.
[222:10.31]I'm sorry.
[222:11.39]I have too much fun when I turn the stream on sometimes.
[222:13.67]I really do.
[222:20.05]I have too much fun.
[222:25.89]pole.
[222:27.18]Get that shit out of here.
[222:29.74]I don't care about whatever that pole says.
[222:36.13]I'd skip work for it.
[222:38.01]I would unsub.
[222:38.83]Only 16 people would unsub.
[222:40.55]How many people would sub?
[223:07.89]I can't afford to sub.
[223:09.07]I skipped work.
[223:11.53]Oh shit.
[223:15.49]Shit.
[223:15.81]Okay.
[223:27.45]What if you put me on the TV at work?
[223:31.57]That was pretty... I don't think I'm supposed to even be able to do that.
[223:35.63]But I... Okay.
[223:37.55]I think I screwed that up.
[223:39.03]But I win.
[223:39.51]That would be weird as fuck.
[223:47.05]Come on.
[223:56.76]Frost?
[223:56.90]Catalyst?
[223:57.20]Catalyst?
[224:00.07]Ooh.
[224:00.65]Alright.
[224:01.35]I want that.
[224:01.89]I want the health too though.
[224:06.03]Frost is... Oh, I got the module key as well.
[224:09.53]Oh no.
[224:11.99]Those of you that said that this game was not too tough, just wait till you get to the fire poker in Siena.
[224:56.76]What just blew by me?
[225:01.26]What's going on?
[225:01.78]Oh.
[225:20.49]Nice.
[225:26.12]I got a lot of essences.
[225:27.00]Alright, so it's like 80% of you would skip work to do that.
[225:37.18]That's kind of cool.
[225:41.43]My soul count is 1895.
[225:42.11]That's 2000.
[225:42.67]Do not explode.
[226:07.08]Leave more stamina.
[226:23.35]I have so... Okay, I gotta get to him.
[226:28.37]Oh!
[226:34.78]Wait, this doesn't feel it's blurry.
[226:37.24]This is from Wait, when did I say this?
[226:40.20]I have to alt tab.
[226:41.48]This is confusing.
[226:42.17]When did I write this?
[226:54.30]I already did this.
[227:06.14]I wrote this already.
[227:17.46]How long ago is that?
[227:26.97]No new jokes.
[227:31.59]Okay, this is going to scare people.
[227:37.04]Oh, I hate it.
[227:38.00]I actually hate this.
[228:34.94]Hold on, can I like do it?
[228:36.14]Let me see.
[228:56.83]It looks like a deep fake.
[229:39.86]Alright, is it in the right spot?
[229:45.08]Is it in the right spot?
[229:50.85]Is that correct?
[230:34.35]Hmm.
[230:45.38]Hmm.
[231:10.11]And here.
[231:13.73]Down there.
[231:22.59]Oh, shit.
[231:25.52]Oh, shit.
[231:26.02]Oh, shit.
[231:55.81]There we go.
[231:57.11]Now you can see the souls.
[232:01.23]I have nothing left.
[232:17.24]Okay.
[232:22.68]Oh, is that the thumbnail now?
[232:23.74]Shit.
[232:24.32]Oh, well.
[232:27.11]fucking crazy.
[232:32.58]I promise we'll move on in a second.
[232:35.22]This thumbnail looks ridiculous, though.
[232:37.84]This looks like a real face.
[232:48.79]Something looks wrong.
[232:50.03]Something's off, right?
[232:51.15]That doesn't even look like me.
[232:52.91]This is a different person.
[232:57.23]It's just different enough where if you've watched my stream a bunch of times, you'd probably say, what's going on?
[233:04.09]Easy clicks.
[233:05.31]Let's go.
[233:10.60]Easy clicks.
[233:23.51]How do I get out of here?
[233:35.74]This game's pretty fun.
[233:45.40]I actually don't want to die.
[233:46.82]I have no health.
[234:06.39]Put the cheese melt back.
[234:07.55]No, we don't... We gotta move on.
[234:12.32]I'm okay with having a comedy segment now and again, but it can't be the entire thing.
[234:20.46]Um... This is back.
[234:21.90]Hold on.
[234:22.34]Wait, what?
[234:25.50]I've been here already, haven't I?
[234:31.70]I've definitely been... Yeah, I've been here already.
[234:33.96]The other way.
[234:43.60]No fun, no fun.
[234:47.42]Plenty of fun.
[234:51.92]Hmm.
[234:56.32]Where do I go?
[234:59.54]You're lost again?
[235:00.26]I know.
[235:02.22]I have to go that way.
[235:04.80]Out and around?
[235:12.64]Why did that...
[235:14.50]How come I didn't grab?
[235:15.36]I think I just have to go out and around.
[235:29.11]Can't jump from here.
[235:29.94]Yeah.
[235:30.58]Whatever.
[235:35.90]You lost 400 viewers.
[235:37.10]That's okay.
[235:39.82]I know that I... You might be a little annoyed by the...
[235:45.49]hamster routine.
[235:46.25]I understand.
[235:50.60]How the fuck do I do this?
[235:58.56]I'm just gonna go back and level up.
[236:01.59]Okay, whatever.
[236:07.16]Hamster shit is so fucking unfunny.
[236:09.10]Move on.
[236:11.04]The person has the stream turned off.
[236:14.82]Like the visual part.
[236:18.69]I really don't blame you.
[236:23.01]Stop botting views.
[236:50.73]Alright, where do I go from here?
[236:59.96]Down here?
[237:01.92]Maybe I don't.
[237:02.50]Maybe just walk.
[237:07.32]This gate is closed.
[237:08.36]I can't open this.
[237:10.98]Shit.
[237:13.36]Lost again.
[237:17.22]He hasn't smiled once?
[237:21.60]I feel like I've been smiling a shitload this whole time.
[237:24.26]Alright, just kill me.
[237:28.34]Where am I supposed to go?
[237:35.27]You know what I've noticed?
[237:36.11]I haven't died once this whole game.
[237:38.33]I don't even know what happens.
[237:43.23]What happens when you die in Steel Series?
[237:46.69]What is this game called?
[237:47.85]Steel...
[237:50.01]Heel rising.
[237:54.45]I died?
[237:54.93]Honestly, I just want to see what happens.
[238:09.75]OK, oh no, you're right, I fell down.
[238:13.95]Alright.
[238:15.09]Where do I go?
[238:20.32]I have to go this way.
[238:21.54]I opened up a shortcut over here, right?
[238:28.70]Over here.
[238:31.84]And then... Down or left?
[238:34.44]I don't know.
[238:34.85]Okay.
[238:46.69]Some reassurance would be nice.
[238:47.61]Are you having fun?
[238:49.09]Yeah.
[238:51.87]I'm a little confused, but I'm having fun.
[239:06.94]Okay.
[239:18.84]Wait a minute.
[239:22.16]Speaking of cheese ball.
[239:26.13]No, I can't reach it.
[239:26.83]I can go here.
[239:50.38]This thing's gonna explode.
[239:51.24]Alright.
[240:03.43]So... I don't think I walked... I think I have to go this way.
[240:10.44]Alright.
[240:14.24]Through here.
[240:21.42]Ross here.
[240:26.52]Stop doing the hamster stuff.
[240:29.14]Stop it.
[240:32.88]Now what?
[240:40.43]It's a dead end.
[240:42.33]There's nothing else here.
[240:43.11]I don't get it.
[241:06.58]Stop parrying me.
[241:15.36]Stop!
[241:18.08]Okay.
[241:21.79]This is a dead end.
[241:29.17]Wait, where am I?
[241:31.55]This person's right here.
[241:32.87]Don't you dare kill me right now.
[241:43.72]That's just back the way I came.
[241:44.70]I don't get it.
[241:47.88]This is a dead end.
[241:55.89]Is this a dead end, though?
[241:56.75]I feel like it kind of can't be.
[241:59.86]Where else am I supposed to go?
[242:18.10]There's nothing else down here to open.
[242:20.91]I have to go back somewhere else.
[242:24.92]I didn't even know this was a door.
[242:26.20]What?
[242:26.40]This is the first door that has ever looked like this that I can open.
[242:30.06]Okay.
[242:30.50]Well, don't die.
[242:34.88]Shit.
[242:35.28]He's gonna follow me.
[242:38.74]That door was the first one that ever looked like that.
[242:47.68]Don't even.
[242:48.10]I don't care.
[242:49.06]Run.
[243:06.58]I know where to go now whatever the door that blended in with everything Everyone that's saying mad because bad I want them timed out Do it do it
[243:38.52]Alright, when I get to the next boss, it's going to be sick.
[243:44.48]Okay, we're good.
[243:45.34]It's confusing.
[243:48.52]It was really confusing.
[243:56.05]Okay, then I turned and I ran.
[243:57.37]Okay.
[244:04.19]Now I can slow it down.
[244:12.74]Oh my god, do not die right now.
[244:47.34]Let's go.
[244:59.96]I feel like I can't hurt these things.
[245:08.86]Okay.
[245:14.19]Oh, there we go.
[245:14.77]Oh, what?
[245:25.88]How come you have Final Fantasy 14 community energy?
[245:29.82]What's that mean?
[245:30.68]You.
[245:32.02]You were made of neither flesh nor blood.
[245:34.89]You are an automat like those who committed this massacre.
[245:38.25]I have received no such command.
[245:40.95]I am carrying out a mission.
[245:42.49]I've been in a weird mood today.
[245:43.73]I'm sorry.
[245:45.01]Your friend on Place Saint Marie informed me of your intentions.
[245:50.54]Alas.
[245:53.14]He means your cringe and your community is annoying.
[246:18.31]I don't think... I think that's what you think.
[246:21.23]I don't think that's what they were saying.
[246:22.55]Wait, he dropped the magic ring?
[246:23.41]How could you not have picked up the magic ring, dude?
[246:26.87]He's just like monologuing and we can just pick it up.
[246:58.55]I, Henri de la Farre, Bishop of Nancy, ask the Lord to bless this assembly and watch over this meeting of the Estates General.
[247:13.82]Let us not turn a blind eye to the misfortunes of a populace who is condemned to the most abject poverty, for there is no greater sin than to ignore the suffering of one's brethren.
[247:33.73]I feel like I could play that part pretty well.
[247:39.52]The wickedness of the court is an insult to the misery that reigns in our lands.
[247:47.30]In such dark times, how can one conceive of hiding away to play shepherdess or tinker with clockwork contraptions?
[248:11.37]Okay.
[248:12.99]Monsieur, what happened?
[248:15.33]You stopped moving.
[248:16.92]I feared you were... broken.
[248:19.64]I do not know.
[248:20.42]I only touched this ring.
[248:23.46]Monseigneur de la Farce ring.
[248:26.04]Artesan.
[248:27.34]Whoever you are, help him.
[248:29.18]Please.
[248:29.99]Lord, let not that his soul be forever lost.
[248:33.63]Make haste.
[248:34.75]I beg of you.
[248:40.80]Defeat the Titan at the Palais de Justice.
[248:45.58]Alright, we got a Titan to fight.
[248:55.85]Corndogs are okay.
[248:56.67]I'm not a huge fan of corndogs.
[249:05.07]Do I have enough to do?
[249:05.95]No, I don't.
[249:07.35]You know, I could upgrade the... Yeah.
[249:09.07]Might as well.
[249:09.55]This thing is amazing.
[249:11.81]Why not?
[249:20.64]I think I'm good.
[249:23.64]I have 123 bullets.
[249:27.44]Alright, let's do it.
[249:28.04]Let's fight the titan.
[249:29.87]Beat the titan at this place.
[249:32.15]Alright, let's go.
[249:41.78]You ignored all of us.
[249:42.64]I mean, I have to play the game.
[249:46.26]I can't just sit there and spam.
[249:55.30]Ooh, I'm doing that.
[249:58.12]That's more heals, right?
[250:09.78]Yep.
[250:13.06]I feel like I've missed one of these somewhere.
[250:14.62]I only have three heals.
[250:16.06]It's really not that good.
[250:19.01]Wait, I'm going to buy the other ones.
[250:20.07]I didn't know this.
[250:26.35]Can I afford it?
[250:33.25]Yeah, I'll get four.
[250:34.05]Alright, let's go fight this Titan.
[250:37.69]And I'm not going to cheese this.
[250:38.69]I'm going to fight it for real.
[250:41.11]No cheese strats.
[250:42.13]No just shooting it from far away and laughing.
[250:44.31]Let me get my inventory in a place where I want it to.
[250:55.32]Alright, I got tons of grenades.
[250:58.68]Oh yeah, this bar is sick.
[251:00.36]Alright, we're good.
[251:19.62]Those things are really good.
[251:26.12]Pretty good.
[251:31.16]We effed?
[251:32.58]What?
[251:34.96]Impossible.
[251:40.94]Oh, God.
[251:44.03]Whoa, you didn't get petrified.
[252:01.12]Who is... Oh, come on.
[252:16.71]Alright.
[252:19.51]Cleared that.
[252:25.88]Somebody said this chat is chaos.
[252:28.64]I mean, somebody just... Yeah, it kind of is.
[252:32.06]Somebody just wrote, mozzarella thoughts.
[252:34.86]Like, I'm going to stop the stream and tell you how I feel about the cheese mozzarella for 10 straight minutes.
[252:44.65]That's what you want.
[252:48.46]But you did do that.
[252:50.26]Yeah, but that was on my own terms.
[252:57.19]You can't just say, alright, mozzarella.
[252:59.25]What do you think?
[253:01.50]It's like hits me in the, I'm doing something.
[253:03.66]If I want to talk about mozzarella, I'll talk about it.
[253:06.08]On my own terms.
[253:10.84]Here we go.
[253:11.22]Time to fight the titan.
[253:14.18]I want, alright, I'm not going to cheese it.
[253:19.43]I'm ready.
[253:21.49]Let's go.
[253:24.45]Unstable butcher.
[253:35.63]What was that?
[254:17.56]so so so so
[254:55.08]I got so greedy there was no reason for me to do that.
[255:14.71]What are you doing?
[255:30.10]There we go.
[255:30.80]Alright.
[255:31.18]There you go.
[255:31.54]I did it without the gun.
[255:47.95]Oh, I am dropping frames, you're right.
[255:56.80]That's weird.
[255:57.24]I really shouldn't be.
[256:11.03]It's terrible.
[256:14.46]Flame resistant, I guess.
[256:32.35]This is way too much armor.
[256:33.39]I mean, I'll just put it on.
[256:34.23]Okay.
[256:43.71]Cool.
[256:46.44]That was a mini boss.
[256:48.54]That's not the titan?
[256:56.35]That was... That was a... That was not... Okay, that was not a boss.
[257:01.01]That was a mini-boss.
[257:04.63]This chest is locked.
[257:07.37]You thought... Yeah, I thought that was the Titan.
[257:09.57]How am I supposed to know?
[257:11.61]That would be whack if that was... I thought that was the Titan.
[257:17.85]Should I go... Can I even go back?
[257:19.33]I want to level up again.
[257:26.61]Yeah, I want to level up.
[257:44.77]What's with the?
[257:45.43]What's with the issues here?
[257:46.23]This kind of came out of nowhere.
[257:48.81]Streaming fine for like 4 plus hours.
[258:02.32]OK, so that's death.
[258:08.76]Don't do that again.
[258:09.44]That's like 30,000 souls here.
[258:10.08]Thank God.
[258:37.10]Can you spare a word about Internet Explorer shutting down tomorrow?
[258:41.30]It is?
[258:41.54]What do you mean shutting down?
[258:57.32]5k.
[259:01.18]It's shutting down tomorrow?
[259:14.58]How many do I need?
[259:15.10]I have 2,000.
[259:17.27]I need... Okay, I can... Let me just kill a few things.
[259:24.30]Wait, not... You're talking about Microsoft Edge.
[259:27.66]You're talking about Internet Explorer, not Microsoft Edge.
[259:46.75]Okay.
[260:12.42]Who cares?
[260:13.04]I mean, I don't use it.
[260:16.02]I have not opened Internet Explorer in a long time.
[260:25.05]Where am I?
[260:25.55]It just bit me on the head and blew up on me.
[260:29.57]I was inside of its mouth.
[260:39.08]I need like another couple hundred.
[260:54.54]After this, this should do it, right?
[260:55.58]Yep.
[261:10.73]Okay.
[261:11.69]3,500.
[261:11.79]That should be it.
[261:16.54]Why is everyone but me so funny?
[261:19.54]What?
[261:20.20]You've definitely probably said something funny in the chat.
[261:21.90]What do you mean?
[261:23.67]You probably said something funny.
[261:32.03]Why is everybody funny?
[261:32.93]What?
[261:33.19]Are you mine?
[261:48.85]Answer the door on the night of a hunt.
[261:50.13]Okay.
[261:50.39]I'm going to go kill a titan.
[261:51.45]Goodbye.
[261:51.87]Fuck you, lady.
[262:18.06]3900?
[262:18.52]Are you kidding me?
[262:19.48]Hold on.
[262:25.50]That's annoying.
[262:26.21]Okay.
[262:59.27]Alright 30 is that enough?
[263:05.21]3938.
[263:05.27]I think that's enough, right?
[263:09.99]It better be.
[263:10.65]I'm just gonna sell something if it's not.
[263:26.40]Another point in endurance.
[263:29.52]Now damage all the way.
[263:35.08]OK.
[263:36.54]Alright, let's go.
[263:38.47]Let's fight the Titan.
[263:48.65]Shouldn't hurt.
[263:50.25]Shouldn't hurt.
[263:59.14]Ayo Jerma, how long you plan on being live for?
[264:01.26]No, no, however long it takes to fight this boss and kill it and do the next area.
[264:08.26]Or at least see the next area.
[264:09.98]Where am I going, dude?
[264:10.80]They're still going to support edge.
[264:16.76]Yeah, I mean, that would be weird if they didn't, right?
[264:20.83]Where am I going?
[264:22.85]Where am I going?
[264:24.07]Where am I going?
[264:24.85]Honest to God, where am I going?
[264:32.69]Oh.
[264:32.75]Oh, it's up here.
[264:43.26]Alright, let's go.
[264:44.92]Let's see what the first real boss is like in this game.
[264:50.96]Can't open that chest.
[264:51.72]It's locked.
[264:55.54]Let's do it.
[264:56.42]Defeat the titan.
[265:09.89]Here we go.
[265:17.68]Bless you.
[265:18.60]Bless you.
[265:19.04]I thank you.
[265:20.14]Leave this place and seek shelter.
[265:22.71]I have seen these machines in action.
[265:24.63]I know all too well their capabilities.
[265:27.03]What should I eat?
[265:27.63]I implore you for nothing but insurance!
[265:31.55]Stop!
[265:34.96]Alright, let's do it.
[265:35.60]Let's see how cool this is.
[265:36.60]Oh, hell yeah.
[265:37.04]Golden Cross, what's that?
[265:38.18]Donald's?
[265:38.38]Maybe.
[266:06.63]Let me take a look at my modules.
[266:07.69]Alright, this is level two.
[266:18.76]Increase physical damage by a fully charged attack.
[266:20.96]I feel like that's really hard to get done.
[266:23.52]This one's good.
[266:24.22]Do I have any other slot, two slot ones?
[266:27.57]Don't.
[266:33.99]I think these are fine.
[266:37.71]Alright, here we go.
[266:42.17]Titan.
[266:43.87]It's time for the game to impress us.
[266:45.07]This is the point where the game could impress everybody.
[266:49.02]I'm curious.
[266:50.44]We've fought a few mini-bosses it seems so far.
[266:55.52]The game could impress us.
[266:57.95]With a really cool boss fight.
[267:09.16]I was I was 100 million years away.
[267:22.01]Here we go.
[267:25.87]Titan fight.
[267:36.71]Almost time.
[267:38.68]How much was this game?
[267:40.50]That's a good question.
[267:41.22]I actually don't remember.
[267:44.27]I bought this game and then turned the stream on maybe six to seven minutes later.
[267:51.55]I think it was 50?
[268:08.22]Rich Andy.
[268:10.90]No, I'm not saying that.
[268:12.24]Oh, I just bought it.
[268:13.00]I don't even care.
[268:15.65]I bought it.
[268:16.27]I was like, oh, that's how much this was.
[268:18.51]I got distracted by turning the stream on immediately.
[268:20.13]Okay.
[268:33.24]How long did it take to download?
[268:34.26]I have fiber.
[268:36.56]I know omega low fiber.
[268:37.74]Like I drop frames sometimes.
[268:38.94]But it's a 1,000 down connection.
[268:43.10]So it's a gigabit.
[268:45.09]Happens very quickly.
[268:52.45]I do have a gigabit connection.
[268:53.69]It's not my fault that some reason Twitch hates my connection to the servers.
[268:57.97]I know.
[269:07.49]It's a flex.
[269:09.37]I mean, it really isn't because this internet costs 75% less than the internet that I had before it.
[269:21.04]It is almost 200 fucking dollars less expensive than the one that I had in the other house that I was in.
[269:30.24]What a perfect time.
[269:43.62]Can I just kill this guy?
[269:44.82]These guys are so annoying.
[269:47.88]Why even fight these guys?
[269:48.82]Pretty good frame drop timing.
[270:06.43]Yeah, for some reason, sometimes Twitch just genuinely hates wherever my traffic is coming from.
[270:12.80]And I have to server hop until I find one that lets me stream on it for a week.
[270:15.58]And then I do it again.
[270:16.78]Bro, I pay 90 for Gigabit where I am, but that's what I mean.
[270:22.66]I used to have to have like this crazy business internet to get over, I believe it was 10 to 20 upload.
[270:32.58]Which was fucking unbelievably stupid.
[270:41.36]Why do you stream at a low bitrate if you're paying for fiber?
[270:43.48]Because you can't stream to Twitch past 6000 bitrate.
[270:47.02]They'll literally turn your stream off.
[270:59.23]Is it the Titan?
[271:06.04]Is that the Titan?
[271:08.12]No, it's not.
[271:08.72]That's the thing.
[271:09.08]We've already fought that.
[271:14.81]That's not the Titan, right?
[271:17.57]We just fought that thing.
[271:26.36]It's really wet where he is walking.
[271:33.93]He's walking through like sludge.
[271:35.99]Why are his shoes filled with water?
[272:00.10]I got the Bible.
[272:04.48]Alright, where's this Titan?
[272:12.59]Nice alright, it's definitely right here.
[272:21.63]I'll get to you in a minute.
[272:26.52]Actually, let me buy a bunch of health potions.
[272:36.55]Oh, that's interesting.
[272:37.18]You can buy these.
[272:38.04]Make sure you don't lose them.
[272:40.21]That's cool.
[272:40.55]Alright, I need to buy this.
[272:50.41]You like the game?
[272:55.53]New to the stream?
[272:56.21]Yeah, I think it's fun.
[273:01.99]I don't think it's as hard as some of the Souls games or some of the other soulslikes, but it's definitely enjoyable.
[273:07.64]It's a fun experience.
[273:08.82]I think it's good.
[273:09.26]Combat's fun.
[273:17.72]I'm afraid it's too late, madame.
[273:19.62]Those whose bodies are strewn about this square paid the ultimate price for their blind trust.
[273:25.16]Like me, they believed in their country, in the National Guard, and they were urged to join.
[273:30.57]We believed in the Marquis de Lafayette, who was to lead them to victory.
[273:34.29]You're not going to stream this again.
[273:36.96]Look at them now.
[273:38.96]See what has become of their beautiful illusions.
[273:47.49]Titan?
[273:51.73]That's a Titan.
[273:52.71]Alright, are you ready?
[273:54.59]Let's go.
[273:54.95]It's time for the Titan fight.
[273:57.27]That's a Titan.
[274:12.43]What is inside of that?
[274:13.85]It's kind of goofy.
[274:23.56]The bishop of the city.
[274:24.86]Alright, let's go.
[274:25.62]First real fight.
[274:46.83]I've done no damage.
[275:01.12]I can't hurt him!
[275:03.68]Oh, you can only hurt the top part.
[275:05.31]Alright, I get it.
[275:08.59]Makes sense.
[275:38.04]Ow!
[276:16.39]Uh-oh.
[276:17.72]Phase 2!
[276:18.22]Phase 2!
[276:18.56]Okay, I got it.
[276:26.12]Um, get up?
[276:31.43]What the?
[276:31.83]How do I get away?
[276:32.39]Just run?
[276:35.47]What the fuck?
[276:37.05]What do I do about this?
[276:55.95]Oh, is that an insta kill?
[276:56.89]Better not be.
[277:09.24]Oh, shit.
[277:17.68]What the fuck is happening?
[277:20.68]What the fuck just happened?
[277:22.91]Oh, shit.
[277:34.08]He's still on the ground!
[277:41.99]Let go!
[277:42.37]Let go!
[277:42.69]Let go!
[277:43.03]Let go!
[277:43.49]Let go of me!
[277:44.39]Let go of me!
[277:46.17]Let go!
[277:47.31]Get off me!
[277:49.11]Get out of here!
[277:50.93]Wait for me!
[277:53.13]Stop!
[277:54.71]Stop attacking!
[277:57.49]What the fuck is happening?! !
[278:12.77]I have no stamina!
[278:38.97]fuck this guy.
[278:39.61]I'm going to show you the real strat.
[278:45.26]Why was I... I'm going to kill this guy in fucking 10 seconds.
[278:54.52]Watch this.
[279:01.84]I'm going to kill this guy in 10 seconds.
[279:12.93]Check this out.
[279:13.97]Watch this.
[279:15.55]This guy's dead.
[279:20.56]Watch this.
[279:22.60]I'm gonna kill this guy in enough time for you to go take a piss and come back.
[279:47.25]Shooops!
[279:47.85]Never mind.
[280:00.88]Detrified!
[280:04.52]Oh my god!
[280:25.95]what am I supposed to do about this honest to goodness get out of here that's that strategy right there
[281:08.32]Grrrr!
[281:40.24]I have so much juice!
[281:49.70]How am I supposed to get away when I have juice?
[281:52.12]What do I do?
[282:13.73]Thank you for watching.
[282:46.84]I'm trying to be with my eyes closed.
[283:01.65]Titan destroy!
[283:16.02]Did you come back from peeing yet?
[283:17.38]That was a long pee.
[283:24.90]That was kind of a fun fight.
[283:26.74]That was a little goofy, though, throwing grenades in random directions.
[283:34.08]I like this game.
[283:34.82]It's funny.
[283:35.42]This game's fun.
[283:36.08]I like it.
[283:36.40]It's fun.
[283:36.76]It's a little humorous.
[283:37.76]It's clean.
[283:37.98]I think it's fun.
[283:44.59]You were throwing grenades at this guy.
[283:47.97]You owe your freedom to the good abbot.
[283:50.05]I tell you, this man is utterly irreplaceable.
[283:54.27]He has devoted himself, body and soul, to the mission I entrusted to him.
[283:58.67]Investigating the king's entourage.
[284:00.79]In particular, the man who enabled him to create this ungodly army.
[284:06.12]The guy just made a YouTube video.
[284:08.14]Just cutting at the end of sentences.
[284:09.98]Like, dude, you took a lot of takes to do that.
[284:13.58]How were you captured, Monseigneur?
[284:16.03]I was with Abbé Grégoire in Place Dauphine.
[284:20.51]We'd gone to speak with the volunteers of the Garde Nationale.
[284:24.31]We implored them not to take up arms against the King's machines.
[284:28.03]Alas, they refused to heed our words, and we had to leave in great haste.
[284:34.53]After that, Monseigneur, I can't remember a thing.
[284:41.07]Those poor people.
[284:43.87]These automats were truly made in the mold of their master.
[284:48.76]Ruthless to think for just one simple reproach against the court.
[284:55.08]The king cast me into hell.
[284:59.24]What nightmare, Monsignor?
[285:01.24]It was terrible.
[285:02.84]I was but a shadow among... We should probably move away from the fire.
[285:07.28]That'd be probably a good idea.
[285:09.30]How long has it been?
[285:11.10]A day?
[285:13.20]There's been they put you in there 20 minutes ago Only been 30 40 minutes Once our time on this Earth has ended if this is true Then how are we to go on living with nothing to hope for nothing to believe it?
[285:24.28]but Won't you?
[285:43.36]The notes.
[285:44.62]What notes, monseigneur?
[285:46.54]The notes the abbot placed in my safekeeping.
[285:48.90]Those heretics took them.
[285:51.70]I know where the documents can be found.
[285:53.64]Oh my god, his neck.
[285:54.74]Did you see that?
[285:55.32]I must go to the Châtelet prison.
[285:56.70]It was like, all the way.
[285:59.12]Where will I be safe?
[286:00.36]Go and join the abbot at the Société des Amis des Noirs.
[286:04.77]It's always powering the titan.
[286:05.89]Oh, that's cool.
[286:07.11]But you must go quickly.
[286:09.35]More automats will be here soon.
[286:17.32]He took right the fuck off.
[286:19.69]There's a hook now?
[286:21.77]Whoa.
[286:22.69]Okay, game just got five times cooler.
[286:24.43]Can you do it in the air?
[286:27.99]Yes, you can.
[286:28.49]Alright, that's cool.
[286:29.95]Cool.
[286:30.49]We got a Sekiro hook.
[286:33.27]And an Omega chest.
[286:40.83]Volley mallet.
[286:42.80]What is that?
[286:46.99]B strength.
[286:48.12]Oh, look at this thing.
[286:49.44]What is it?
[286:55.64]Oh, it's such a Looney Tunes weapon.
[287:10.65]Whoa, it's a shotgun?
[287:11.67]It's strength, though.
[287:16.05]I can't use it.
[287:18.23]That's really cool.
[287:18.81]You know, the weapon designs are very good.
[287:26.19]That's definitely an absolute plus one.
[287:29.05]The weapons are really cool.
[287:35.56]Alright.
[287:38.62]Now what?
[287:44.28]Oh, we have to get the notes.
[287:53.43]I would have missed that.
[287:54.32]Okay.
[287:56.30]Countering module.
[287:57.14]Get out of here.
[288:18.60]Get someone to scream chat messages at you for a stream.
[288:21.66]You know, I've thought about turning on TTS for one day.
[288:23.76]Can I grapple something?
[288:34.27]Um... Oh, okay, over there.
[288:44.68]Don't.
[288:46.45]Well, okay, it would be, the mods would be there.
[288:49.99]And they would be able to push through and delete stuff if they needed to.
[288:54.53]How many souls?
[288:55.27]41?
[288:55.49]I'm almost there.
[289:04.99]No crunchies?
[289:07.87]I can sell, yeah, I'm going to sell some stuff.
[289:12.66]TTS is annoying.
[289:15.11]Well, I figured I'm not going to do it.
[289:17.60]I just thought about it.
[289:18.62]Talking about screaming chat messages at somebody.
[289:23.36]Let me sell.
[289:32.18]Sell this.
[289:34.50]Sell these.
[289:38.16]Sell these.
[289:45.28]No, I'm going to sell the claws.
[289:46.60]I'm not going to use them.
[289:47.52]Fuck it.
[289:51.22]I know don't selling weapons is the dumbest thing.
[289:53.20]Don't sell weapons.
[289:53.94]It's fine.
[290:07.45]Endurance.
[290:10.05]Alright, and I'm going to buy more heels.
[290:21.46]Alright, is it a McDonald's kind of night tonight?
[290:23.02]McDonald's kind of night?
[290:30.42]Taco Bell?
[290:31.02]Wendy's?
[290:31.94]Which one?
[290:32.42]What do you think?
[290:39.30]The Châtelet prison is at the other end of the Pont-en-Change.
[290:43.10]This grappling hook will be very useful.
[290:50.25]Ooh, we're up here now.
[290:53.44]Cool.
[290:54.40]That's where we were before.
[290:55.60]See you later.
[291:13.62]Do I go down there?
[291:20.51]Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco Bell.
[291:22.63]Maybe I will do Taco Bell.
[291:23.76]What time is it?
[291:24.26]Mmmmm.
[291:24.42]Popeye's?
[291:24.88]That's right.
[291:26.14]Wait, you can use the hook in combat?
[291:27.78]Really?
[291:50.88]What?
[291:53.92]That's pretty cool.
[291:54.58]How many does it use?
[291:58.42]Ow.
[292:08.33]Stop being the enemy that I have the most trouble with.
[292:19.91]Yeah, what kind of knight is it?
[292:24.92]First cry the next boss or Arpes.
[292:26.60]We're not doing that again.
[292:29.52]I do want to play that game again though, so I do want to do that again.
[292:34.25]That game was fun.
[292:36.27]That was a fun game.
[292:38.03]That was a phenomenal game.
[292:39.65]I want to play it again.
[293:06.14]Should I get... You want me to get the dog?
[293:14.42]Is it time for auto?
[293:35.67]I'm not going to fight these guys.
[293:36.53]Why?
[293:36.75]No, I haven't been here, have I?
[293:40.49]Excuse me.
[293:48.52]The Grand Chatelet.
[293:51.10]Alright, this is a good place to stop.
[293:57.12]I'll go get auto.
[293:58.30]We'll do an auto hangout session for like a minute or two.
[294:02.54]You want my final first impressions of this game?
[294:06.12]That was fun.
[294:07.56]That was actually a pretty fun game.
[294:10.48]I enjoyed that.
[294:13.96]Is it a 10 out of 10?
[294:14.92]No.
[294:16.39]Is it a 5 out of 10?
[294:17.35]No.
[294:18.71]Is it a 6 out of 10?
[294:19.65]No, it's higher.
[294:20.65]Is it an 8 out of 10?
[294:21.57]Not sure.
[294:22.71]Is it a good game?
[294:23.49]Yeah.
[294:24.17]That was fun.
[294:25.61]I think it was worth playing.
[294:28.99]I would have stopped if I didn't think it was good.
[294:30.49]It was pretty fun.
[294:31.27]I liked it.
[294:32.44]I think it probably gets a little bit more interesting a little bit later, maybe.
[294:36.94]Is it a seven?
[294:38.12]It's like between, depending on who you are, somewhere between like a seven and an eight something.
[294:43.80]I don't give ratings on this stream.
[294:48.07]There's no way that's an eight.
[294:48.91]Come on, Gwen.
[294:49.43]I didn't say that.
[294:53.27]This is... Okay, the game was... How do you rate a game?
[294:56.66]The game was clean.
[294:58.00]The animations were clean.
[294:59.34]Combat was fun.
[295:01.26]The bosses are a little easier than I would have liked.
[295:06.86]Only saw four of them, though.
[295:09.38]I don't know how long the game is.
[295:12.79]I thought it was fun.
[295:15.69]There's definitely enough there to be interested.
[295:16.97]There's definitely... It seems like there's enough weapons.
[295:18.95]The weapons are awesome.
[295:20.05]They kind of remind me of Bloodborne, where they're very cool and very different.
[295:23.83]Turn the difficulty up.
[295:25.30]I could.
[295:27.46]It's pretty cheesable.
[295:28.66]Yeah, but whatever.
[295:29.28]I mean, you don't have to play it like that.
[295:30.60]Alright, let me go get auto.
[295:34.24]That was Steel Rising.
[295:36.54]It's on Steam.
[295:38.66]It was kind of fun.
[295:39.98]I would say it was worth playing.
[295:41.02]Let me go get auto.
[295:43.43]I'll be right back.
[295:49.29]You guys can see that auto exists.
[295:56.86]I'll be right back.
[296:57.98]Okay.
[296:58.12]Can you see him?
[297:03.23]What's going on, Ato?
[297:03.99]What's going on?
[297:09.81]Ato!
[297:13.87]You seem like we've had turkey now.
[297:18.49]He was very sleepy.
[297:19.37]Are you tired?
[297:26.09]He was sleeping.
[297:32.66]He hates us.
[297:33.42]He just woke up, yeah.
[297:35.72]Are you sleepy?
[297:37.58]Did I disturb you?
[297:38.36]He's my special boy.
[297:44.68]Is he chunky?
[297:45.70]He's a little chunky.
[297:46.64]It's been hot.
[297:48.70]He's okay, though.
[297:49.98]Wanna go?
[297:53.18]It's been like 115 degrees.
[297:53.84]120 degrees.
[297:54.40]It's not time for him to be outside.
[298:00.90]He's a little chunky.
[298:01.68]We're working on it.
[298:02.52]We're working on it.
[298:06.17]He's a little lumpy.
[298:10.09]But yeah, I'll see you guys later.
[298:11.29]That's going to be the end.
[298:18.21]Well, he wasn't sleeping sleeping.
[298:20.10]He was asleep and then kind of woke up a little while ago and was resting.
[298:27.50]He was a little sleepy.
[298:33.17]Alright, so... I've gotta do- I gotta sign a thousand baseballs.
[298:38.46]And ship them out.
[298:40.66]I'll see you for the Omega weekend.
[298:42.50]Uh, get your recommendations in, we'll get a whole list.
[298:44.32]We're gonna play, like, five to ten games this weekend.
[298:47.03]We're gonna do a ton of shit this weekend.
[298:51.83]I will see you on Friday.
[298:54.01]Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Omega weekend.
[299:01.93]I'm going to go do this, get this done.
[299:04.63]If I do get it done before then, if it doesn't take more than a couple days to really get all these things shipped out and signed and everything, then I will let you know.
[299:13.51]But my plan is to come back on Friday.
[299:17.95]And we're not going to start at 4.
[299:20.43]We'll start at probably around 2.
[299:23.57]I'll start earlier, I promise.
[299:31.28]See you next week.
[299:32.30]No, this is going to be an Omega weekend.
[299:34.63]The more that I say Omega weekend, the more that it has to happen, right?
[299:41.57]We're going to do sorcery.
[299:42.89]We're going to do.
[299:46.61]Some other stuff.
[299:49.50]We're going to do.
[299:53.24]Figure it out.
[299:59.20]ULTRAKILL, maybe.
[300:03.96]We're going to play each one of these games for two to four hours each.
[300:09.84]All weekend.
[300:11.14]Delay Andy will happen.
[300:12.20]Delay Andy will not happen.
[300:14.24]Nope.
[300:14.80]I'm going to make sure there's no chance for a Delay Andy.
[300:27.90]No, you can clip that.
[300:28.90]You can.
[300:29.16]Thanks for watching.
