[ve:60.16.100]

[00:14.50]Alright, I'm back.
[00:15.56]What's up?
[00:15.88]I got the music working again.
[00:20.05]Aren't you happy?
[00:24.41]Fucking better be.
[00:26.47]Sorry.
[00:31.43]Alright, Street Fighter 6.
[00:32.21]Let's go.
[00:37.63]So I have to tell you, I need to make this very clear.
[00:41.13]I am not a fighting game player at all.
[00:45.93]You've seen me play stuff like multiverses.
[00:50.15]But traditional fighting games, I don't play them.
[00:53.44]I'm not really super into them.
[00:57.06]But Street Fighter VI caught my eye for a few different reasons.
[01:02.06]One of which is the single player mode.
[01:08.29]That is the reason why I bought this game.
[01:11.25]Is because of that.
[01:14.75]Does the title still make sense for this game?
[01:17.48]Don't adjust your TV set.
[01:18.66]Yes, I'm actually playing.
[01:19.64]I guess that makes sense too.
[01:20.62]Why would I be playing this?
[01:29.72]Alright.
[01:36.89]So...
[01:39.75]I need to make a character, and I apologize that it's probably going to take about at least 30 minutes.
[01:45.30]I got no timer on this.
[01:50.10]The character creator is, um... is kind of ridiculous from what I've seen, so let's go for it.
[02:02.64]You should see it.
[02:04.80]Right...
[02:07.17]now you should see it right now there we go alright so what I want to do I want to do this this is world tour create an avatar and embark on a journey to discover the meaning of strength take the plunge and experience the world of Street Fighter like never before let's go you ready so I've been thinking about strength man go
[02:36.70]I think I'll make... Make Miku?
[02:39.65]Well, let's get in there first.
[02:57.31]I'll turn it up.
[02:57.85]Honestly, Capcom doesn't miss lately.
[02:59.34]Capcom doesn't miss.
[03:00.54]I don't know what happened.
[03:24.49]What happened?
[03:26.93]Capcom doesn't miss anymore.
[03:29.79]That's kind of surprising.
[03:31.69]I know, yeah, I said fuck Capcom that time, but it was... I didn't mean it.
[03:36.31]I was in a fit of rage.
[03:37.51]I did say that a couple years ago.
[03:44.57]Well, now it's a bug.
[03:54.35]bless Capcom cool you can remove screen shake in this game already did it you my new recruit kids take a breather luke welcome
[04:22.57]Aw, new character.
[04:27.82]New character.
[04:29.90]Alright, here we go.
[04:33.92]What do I make?
[04:36.92]A new you, creating your avatar.
[04:38.86]Creating avatar for world tour mode.
[04:40.43]It will also be used in the battle hub.
[04:43.29]Okay.
[04:45.93]Oh, I think I have to do this.
[04:48.19]The length of your limbs and size of your body matter during battle.
[04:53.01]Having long limbs makes it easier.
[04:54.63]So I have to just have wicked long arms?
[04:57.47]Make Gollum?
[05:00.75]We have to live with this character for as long as I play this game.
[05:03.43]We have to live with this.
[05:06.10]Okay.
[05:06.22]Resets.
[05:23.21]So where do we start?
[05:24.07]Okay, wait, there's more.
[05:27.07]Alright, I think I'm starting here.
[05:31.91]Oh, come on.
[05:32.87]Don't.
[05:33.09]I think I have to start here.
[05:42.74]Okay.
[05:47.20]Body preset.
[05:48.60]They also hit back easier.
[05:53.77]Moving the point of the triangle after making the settings for interval... Okay, so just telling me that it... Okay.
[06:07.19]How big do I want to make this guy?
[06:15.44]I kind of like that.
[06:18.48]That's a good start.
[06:19.34]We can change it after.
[06:23.34]Blend face?
[06:24.14]No, no, no.
[06:26.88]Height and proportions?
[06:30.61]Well, that just doesn't look right.
[06:32.11]How tall is this?
[06:37.27]Sitting height?
[06:38.99]Changing your height to the minimum or maximum?
[06:43.38]Okay, so there's a certain value where it becomes kind of screwed up.
[06:54.58]Oh no.
[06:55.00]Okay.
[07:05.80]I'm going to hate this after 10 minutes.
[07:15.32]Because I have a long ass torso.
[07:19.06]Alright, I think it's fine.
[07:22.28]Upper body.
[07:29.51]Now I can do neck length.
[07:36.62]Somebody said Crash Bandicoot.
[07:38.94]Okay, we're making Crash Bandicoot.
[07:41.24]We're making Crash Bandicoot.
[07:42.60]That is exactly who this is going to be.
[07:44.36]Wow, that's what a great fucking comment.
[07:48.46]This needs to be up way higher.
[07:49.62]We got to cover the head because we need to put Crash Bandicoot's face on his chest.
[08:07.64]Oh, my God.
[08:11.54]You crash his voice?
[08:13.54]Okay, um... Whoa!
[08:19.84]It's like that, right?
[08:35.35]He's kind of like a... He kind of looks like a flounder.
[08:42.23]No, no, no.
[08:42.58]It said big.
[08:43.08]Make the arms big.
[08:47.16]How big are Crash Bandicoot's hands?
[08:50.92]They're actually kind of long.
[08:53.16]They go down this far.
[08:57.86]These arms are way too thick, though.
[09:01.17]That's better.
[09:02.99]Shoulders are too thick.
[09:05.15]This is just a Titan from Attack on Titan.
[09:07.29]Yeah.
[09:08.13]That's what everybody is making, okay?
[09:10.71]Everybody is making an Attack on Titan Titan.
[09:14.19]That's what every person you've seen play this game does.
[09:17.16]There are no normal people made with this.
[09:19.56]No one.
[09:20.42]Not a single person is making normal people.
[09:35.25]Abdomen bulge.
[09:36.31]Okay, hold on.
[09:43.15]Forehead protrusion.
[09:44.60]Eyebrow spacing.
[09:45.00]Okay, that looks fine.
[09:45.76]Brow depth.
[10:11.07]I like the higher browse.
[10:15.13]Surprised or angry?
[10:17.80]Angry for sure.
[10:18.48]100%.
[10:18.70]Yep.
[10:18.86]This is alright so far.
[10:44.37]Along to the Joppy.
[10:45.25]That's a lot of neck.
[10:53.96]That's mostly neck.
[10:59.68]Oh my goodness.
[11:07.85]With a huge underbite.
[11:09.07]Alright.
[11:19.97]jaw shape this kind of has to fill into the neck a little bit maybe not no pull it back that's fine okay cool air I actually kind of like this one okay uh it might be this one too
[11:52.34]Oh my goodness, alright.
[12:05.36]Is it just a middle part?
[12:16.81]That's good too though.
[12:17.85]Oh, that's really good.
[12:22.86]That's good too.
[12:23.69]Okay.
[12:35.64]Wait, I need hair color.
[12:36.46]Uh, am I fucking this up?
[12:47.06]Why is it red?
[12:47.54]Does it have wicked shiny hair?
[12:56.05]What, how many, wait, how many colors can I do?
[12:58.09]Why is it red?
[13:02.15]Why is it just getting redder?
[13:11.32]Am I mixing the colors together?
[13:12.86]Hair color one.
[13:16.22]Okay.
[13:16.44]There we go.
[13:16.72]Alright.
[13:24.66]That's fine.
[13:31.93]Oh, color mixing.
[13:33.15]There it is.
[13:33.49]Alright, that's fine with me.
[13:38.10]Eye shape?
[13:48.57]Alright, we have to put the eyes down really low.
[14:03.19]Okay, that looks fine.
[14:04.15]Eye size.
[14:05.13]Hmm.
[14:13.48]Wait, what did I just do?
[14:14.14]No, no, no.
[14:19.18]How do I?
[14:19.60]Oh, right here.
[14:28.89]Okay, I like the big eyes.
[14:34.04]Intensity?
[14:34.74]Whoa.
[14:37.50]Okay.
[14:38.08]That's cool.
[14:38.52]Should we just give him Undertaker eyes?
[14:46.42]Okay.
[14:53.37]Yep.
[14:56.29]I like it.
[15:08.66]When somebody with blue eyes looks at you.
[15:22.83]Make him bright.
[15:25.07]Oh no, too bright.
[15:33.68]Okay.
[15:38.74]Lashes?
[15:39.14]Did you just say no eyelashes?
[15:43.91]Yeah, I'm thinking no eyelashes at all.
[15:49.11]No eyebrows either.
[16:00.18]Yeah, no eyebrows and no eyelashes.
[16:14.19]Okay, here we go.
[16:14.85]This is where we start to really make the face the face.
[16:16.55]I don't like this at all, but I guess we're living with it.
[16:29.11]Now I want to go and zoom into his face.
[16:40.61]This dude's hitboxes are going to be so fucked.
[16:43.19]Oh, that's right.
[16:44.13]Oh, well.
[17:00.88]Oh, the nostrils are all the way down here.
[17:02.80]Okay.
[17:25.23]I think I'm alright with this.
[17:26.27]Alright, mouth position probably all the way down, right?
[17:37.17]I want the lower... That's alright.
[17:55.43]Mouth corners?
[17:57.17]No, happy for sure.
[18:01.85]That's terrifying.
[18:10.37]Okay, that's fine.
[18:11.33]I think that looks good.
[18:25.19]Alright facial hair.
[18:37.69]That's alright.
[18:38.93]Oh my goodness.
[18:41.53]Wow, that's long.
[18:44.11]Wow.
[18:50.48]That one's great too.
[18:57.82]Holy shit.
[18:58.58]Okay.
[19:01.40]Gandalf?
[19:07.80]We need new hair then.
[19:13.63]If this is Gandalf.
[19:15.05]Or if this is, you know, we need new hair.
[19:16.27]What kind of hair does Gandalf have?
[19:22.25]I guess it's kind of like this.
[19:38.41]Why is it so... Like, oh, it's the... Okay, there we go.
[19:47.52]Okay.
[19:49.34]He's way too fucked up.
[19:50.98]You know what I mean?
[19:51.42]Oh, lower body.
[19:57.48]We can fix everything.
[19:58.16]Alright, hold on.
[20:13.44]Huge waist.
[20:16.74]No, no, no, no.
[20:22.63]Huge pelvis.
[20:23.99]Oh, no.
[20:24.45]He looks like a refrigerator.
[20:28.13]Alright, I'll keep it.
[20:33.02]I'll keep it.
[20:33.42]I'll keep it.
[20:33.98]We need to make him as square as possible.
[20:44.96]Oh, yep, 100%.
[20:51.28]No, everything has to be the same.
[20:52.60]Oh my god.
[21:01.01]What?
[21:02.49]Why?
[21:13.55]Oh, this is too much.
[21:15.37]Okay.
[21:18.51]What else we got?
[21:20.57]Muscle definition?
[21:24.79]Soft.
[21:30.96]Wait, metallic?
[21:39.86]Metallic?
[21:42.83]Are you just going to be shining?
[21:45.13]That's going to be so annoying to look at.
[21:48.53]No, I'm sorry.
[21:49.65]I mean, that's pretty damn cool, though.
[21:58.94]I mean, that's pretty cool.
[22:07.09]Maybe not so metallic.
[22:14.29]Okay.
[22:15.79]That looks good.
[22:22.08]Hair quality one or two.
[22:24.20]We're going to have back hair.
[22:36.45]Okay.
[22:40.29]I think... Oh, you are kind of... Alright, wait a minute.
[22:43.85]Sitting height.
[22:46.84]This has to be, I think, as long as possible.
[22:59.27]Okay.
[23:01.33]He's kind of a piece of toast.
[23:03.73]He's like a piece of bread.
[23:12.79]I'm happy with this so far.
[23:15.73]Body paint?
[23:16.43]Oh, I can get... We don't need that.
[23:17.43]What do I have here?
[23:18.21]Okay, I... Alright, hold on.
[23:55.17]Okay, how about this one?
[23:58.85]Is this one cool?
[23:59.81]I don't know.
[24:01.81]Nice one piece character that you made.
[24:03.96]True.
[24:12.26]Oops, what'd I do?
[24:15.76]Oh shit, I screwed it up.
[24:32.45]Um, what am I, what is this?
[24:33.63]I don't know what setting.
[24:37.31]Oh, it's my lips.
[24:49.03]Okay.
[24:49.40]This is a mole.
[24:51.48]No, how do I get, I want to take that off.
[24:57.10]Shit.
[24:57.44]How do I, how do I get this off?
[25:01.70]There we go.
[25:02.02]Okay.
[25:05.14]Okay, body hair color.
[25:07.34]Yeah, we did this already.
[25:09.56]Alright, voice.
[25:11.97]Let's see what you've got.
[25:15.93]Let's see what you've got.
[25:17.17]Let's see how you do.
[25:23.62]This one's good.
[25:24.60]Oh, this is a good one.
[25:25.73]That was somebody getting trapped in a combo.
[25:53.11]I like that one.
[25:53.51]Play the game?
[25:53.93]Relax!
[25:54.05]This is half the game right here!
[25:54.82]I like it.
[25:55.08]Okay, current recipe.
[25:55.52]Download recipe?
[25:56.54]No, I just... No, I'm ready.
[26:24.94]I think we're good.
[26:27.78]I think we're good.
[26:28.27]Flatline Greg is going to be his name.
[26:32.11]Okay.
[26:32.91]Sounds good to me.
[26:33.89]What do I have to do?
[26:50.83]Let's go.
[26:51.43]Oh goodness.
[26:51.77]Yeah.
[26:51.95]Gotta say you're photogenic.
[27:16.28]Honestly, the people that make normal characters, you have a lot of mental fortitude.
[27:25.78]The mental fortitude it takes to not make your character's nose four or five inches off of their face is incredible.
[27:33.83]I can't believe that you're able to do that.
[27:37.35]Alright, how do we play Street Fighter?
[27:38.95]Okay.
[27:39.31]Okay.
[27:50.56]alright yep there are three movement speeds what too easy it just doesn't fit at all in this entire universe I hate this character already anyway moving right along I placed some panels on the floor you see them this head is too small I'm gonna I'm not gonna I'm gonna hate it pass through every last one
[28:19.98]Okay.
[28:21.24]Press A, B, X, Y while holding right bumper allowing you to control the camera even while using a controller that has no right stick.
[28:27.72]Alright, well that's fine.
[28:32.54]Oh, great.
[28:36.59]Operate the camera.
[28:37.69]Use right stick?
[28:50.72]It's for Arcade Stick.
[28:52.28]Okay.
[28:54.52]You look like a door.
[28:57.44]Alright, there are two control schemes for battles in World Tour mode.
[29:03.56]Modern and Classic.
[29:04.66]Cool.
[29:05.62]Modern is a four-button layout that allows players to enjoy a more free-form approach to combat.
[29:11.97]Hmm.
[29:15.37]Modern is the only control type available in World Tour during Chapter 1.
[29:18.41]Okay, so it's not
[29:21.60]I looked into this a little bit.
[29:26.33]Yeah, so it's light attack, medium attack, heavy attack, special move.
[29:28.93]I get it.
[29:32.39]Might as well.
[29:38.17]Yep.
[29:38.85]Holding back is blocking, right?
[29:41.24]Alright, I punched.
[29:43.42]I did it.
[29:46.46]Jump three times.
[29:47.48]I know how to do that.
[29:48.40]Up.
[29:53.22]Nice.
[29:55.12]You should just do modern.
[29:56.04]I probably will just do modern.
[30:00.01]Crouch.
[30:09.87]Cool.
[30:12.44]The beard physics are way too distracting.
[30:14.46]Yeah, but we have to live with it.
[30:15.76]It's fine.
[30:19.04]Okay.
[30:19.88]Light, medium, heavy.
[30:20.60]Sure.
[30:24.86]Yep, attack while jumping multiple times.
[30:27.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:30.16]Got it.
[30:34.10]Three special attacks.
[30:36.12]So these are special moves like Budokan.
[30:39.80]But you don't have to do like down, left, down, right.
[30:43.07]Left, down, right, left, down, right, left, down, right, square, left, down, right, square, right.
[30:46.81]You actually just press one button.
[30:48.85]I actually like that a lot.
[30:49.91]So I'm sorry if I'm a casual.
[30:52.01]Apologize in advance.
[30:54.41]Okay.
[30:56.66]So it's just in a direction and that.
[30:58.74]Somebody said it's like Smash Brothers.
[31:00.24]Huh.
[31:04.00]Okay, cool.
[31:06.94]Ooh.
[31:10.46]That's the point of Modern.
[31:11.82]Cool.
[31:13.92]Throw Luke three times.
[31:16.84]Left trigger if you're using Modern control scheme.
[31:21.68]Cool.
[31:30.14]Modern's fine.
[31:31.64]Yeah, I'm not worried about it.
[31:33.58]I'm not really a fighting game player.
[31:35.78]But that means I can have fun too.
[31:38.28]Cool.
[31:39.78]Can you play with the modern style online?
[31:41.41]Do you have to go against other modern players?
[31:45.37]Yeah.
[32:06.27]You do less damage with it.
[32:08.29]Modern and classic can play each other.
[32:09.69]They're intended to be balanced, so both are viable.
[32:11.91]That's cool.
[32:14.13]Alright.
[32:17.27]We might have to take the beard off.
[32:18.51]It actually is way too distracting.
[32:25.11]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[32:28.37]Decrease every, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:29.43]Decline victory, decrease every, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:30.92]Let's do it.
[32:50.27]I can't believe he got hit in the tutorial.
[33:05.31]Modern does less damage.
[33:10.04]Come on, man.
[33:10.78]Are you really going to be the type to jump before you think?
[33:14.87]But coach, that was the kind of situation I want to learn to deal with.
[33:20.83]You're not here to punch bags either, right?
[33:27.26]This is fun.
[33:29.40]When does he play Gollum?
[33:37.16]I already did.
[33:37.72]I already gave it a rating too.
[33:41.73]It was a 5.3.
[33:45.03]Gollum is a 5.3.
[33:48.38]No, actually, it's like a 4.8.
[33:55.52]That's generous.
[33:56.02]That's way too high.
[33:56.66]Give it a 1.
[34:25.67]Listen to what your coach says and put your hearts into your training.
[34:28.89]Game was 60 bucks.
[34:30.46]Oh, fuck.
[34:31.16]It was.
[34:31.60]Oh, my God.
[34:33.52]I completely didn't even take.
[34:34.66]I did not even take that into consideration.
[34:42.91]I just death stared.
[34:48.11]That was a, you're dead at some point in this story.
[34:52.19]I'm going to kill you.
[34:53.87]Ooh, new content.
[35:20.05]Billionaire streamer does not care about the price.
[35:23.05]No, I told you I did.
[35:24.57]That's why I was like, wait, that's true.
[35:34.37]I cannot wait to play this.
[35:36.09]Those of you that don't know why I'm excited about a Street Fighter game, when it's like, when has he ever cared about this?
[35:41.98]It's this game mode.
[35:43.10]And just wait, that ass is huge.
[35:46.22]It was distracting.
[35:47.40]Holy shit.
[35:48.96]Okay.
[35:50.48]What was I?
[35:50.84]I don't remember what I was saying.
[36:03.04]It's open world.
[36:07.60]And you can just kind of fight anybody.
[36:11.02]It seems really cool.
[36:29.28]Your character fits right in.
[36:30.74]I don't know about that.
[36:40.59]Those feet look like cactuses.
[36:42.97]They look like cactus.
[36:46.16]What was going on there?
[36:55.55]Actual hands-on experience on the streets.
[36:57.45]Beating up the bad guys around here should do the trick.
[37:03.44]Sorry, did the joke fly over your head?
[37:06.10]At any rate, I was told this would point us toward our next steps.
[37:10.11]Oh, hang on a minute.
[37:10.71]I'm getting a message from Coach.
[37:12.07]There's an app on your device.
[37:13.29]Check it out.
[37:13.71]Did you get anything?
[37:17.97]You can view all sorts of information by pressing... Cool.
[37:23.62]Okay.
[37:25.58]You can view messages sent to your device by selecting Messages.
[37:29.36]Luke, let's get you started with some missions.
[37:32.49]Sending you training exercises to the missions app.
[37:36.35]Check it out and follow any instructions that pop up there.
[37:40.97]Okay.
[37:42.55]Missions.
[37:45.45]New kid on the block.
[37:47.11]Welcome to the streets where you go and what you do is entirely up to you.
[37:50.31]But if you'd like to get a feel for how things are and usually done somewhere, there's no quick way than asking the locals.
[37:55.07]Look for a person named Alice.
[37:56.61]She'll show you the ropes.
[38:00.69]Let's go.
[38:04.06]Basically, it's a to-do list.
[38:06.92]The first thing we need to do is talk to that person right over there.
[38:12.68]That should be easy.
[38:13.30]Let's get going.
[38:20.27]Your mission destination is denoted by a red mark.
[38:24.09]Try making your way to the destination using the mark as your guide.
[38:26.95]Yep.
[38:32.89]This person's level 9.
[38:33.75]What level am I?
[38:34.77]Wahahahaha.
[38:40.14]What do you think of my performance?
[38:41.78]Exciting, right?
[38:43.62]When you're performing, what matters most is technique, tempo, and a mindset that practically commands onlookers to behold.
[38:51.99]It's Lucifer.
[38:53.09]With that in mind, I'm going to teach you a pose to harness that very same mental fortitude.
[38:56.55]Okay.
[38:57.41]Okay.
[39:01.32]Emote acquisition item.
[39:02.94]Check me out.
[39:03.58]Okay.
[39:07.04]Now that's a mindset you can set your watch to.
[39:09.12]And all hinges on how you're feeling, friend.
[39:11.49]Wa-ha!
[39:11.95]Alright, let's do this.
[39:19.17]Alice.
[39:19.85]And you two must be a couple of rookies who just want to get stronger, I take it.
[39:26.69]Right on the money.
[39:27.11]How did you know it was us?
[39:28.49]Seriously, come on.
[39:29.07]It's practically written on your faces.
[39:33.95]That would have been $4 in Golem.
[39:39.98]He asked me to assist with your training for a bit.
[39:43.10]Your little mission to come talk to me was a smashing success.
[39:46.06]Next up, how about we have ourselves a fight?
[39:48.64]Don't hold anything back now.
[39:49.68]I'm a lot stronger than you two.
[39:51.22]Okay.
[39:54.36]Plan 10 hits.
[39:58.00]When playing using the modern control scheme, assisted combos can be performed by keeping right trigger pressed while attacking.
[40:05.16]And then attack with right trigger X or right trigger A, and you can follow up with a combo by simply repeating the button press.
[40:11.59]Okay.
[40:13.19]Okay.
[40:23.30]Okay.
[40:37.18]So you hold right trigger.
[40:38.68]It's Luigi mode.
[40:39.50]That's fine.
[40:43.08]Are you getting one of the first to get to level 100 in Diablo 4?
[40:47.64]I've played a little bit of Diablo 4.
[40:49.28]I have a few thoughts on it.
[40:51.10]Can't give you my total opinion of the game so far, but what I can tell you is this.
[40:59.18]So I find it funny.
[41:01.02]And I don't know why.
[41:01.48]A lot of games have been doing this, I think, nowadays.
[41:04.67]But maybe minor spoilers for Diablo 4.
[41:08.33]If you don't want to hear it, just mute and come back in 30 seconds.
[41:10.97]But I'll tell you something.
[41:14.15]The... Okay, ready?
[41:16.54]Here comes spoilers for it.
[41:17.72]3, 2, 1.
[41:19.50]Oh, you just missed her.
[41:22.10]Our Lilith was just passed through this town and she would fucked a bunch of stuff up.
[41:27.62]Oh, you missed her!
[41:28.28]And you go to the next town.
[41:30.38]Oh, you just missed it.
[41:31.99]She was here, and she ate somebody, and then she killed three people.
[41:36.25]At the next town, I feel like she might be going there next.
[41:39.71]And you walk to that town.
[41:41.27]Oh, you have, boy, oh boy, you just missed Lilith.
[41:44.70]She was here, she stole one of our swines, she stole one of our pigs, and she, and then she, it's like we've been, I don't know.
[41:54.04]kind of just we're kind of just walking and chasing lilith and at some point there's even a sequence where spoilers we're still talking spoilers you end up going to this place and it's like oh I know where she went she went this way we have to chase her she went to the next spot oh she's passed through here you end up coming back to that town and it's leveled like she actually came back
[42:28.56]Why is he spoiling?
[42:30.08]I just told you we're talking Diablo 4 spoilers.
[42:34.80]That's the entire Diablo II storyline.
[42:37.37]I think the reason why I don't mind it in the Diablo II storyline is because you only get to hear that like three times total.
[42:45.69]Not every new town you go to.
[42:47.43]Do you know what I mean?
[42:50.73]There are a lot of towns in Diablo 4, and it's almost like, oh, yeah, this is town number 15.
[42:55.49]Where'd she go?
[42:59.19]Find her.
[43:00.65]Follow the trail.
[43:01.91]Quick adventurer, defend me while I open this door.
[43:06.93]I can read the runes.
[43:08.31]Oh, quick adventurer.
[43:10.29]Here they come.
[43:10.83]I feel like that's happened quite a few times.
[43:17.79]But.
[43:19.91]But.
[43:22.90]But... It's pretty fun.
[43:28.44]Yeah, it's fun.
[43:29.72]But, it's fun.
[43:34.37]What happened to my... Street Fighter... I thought you said Street Fighter 4.
[43:38.59]Whatever fucking game this is.
[43:39.75]Street Fighter 6?
[43:41.77]I'm fucked up.
[43:42.41]I can't even read what you said.
[43:48.09]I have one other complaint about Diablo 4, and I'm going to give it to you right now.
[43:53.62]Alright, here we go.
[43:55.92]Yeah, call me stupid.
[43:57.68]Call me, whoa, he needs like something to explain to him.
[44:01.59]There's a lot of if, therefores in Diablo 4.
[44:06.13]There's a lot of like, if this, then that, then this.
[44:11.24]Like, lucky hit chance.
[44:13.72]If somebody's standing in your poison, and then you do chilled to them, then if there's lucky hit percentage going off, then 10% critical strike chance will go up.
[44:27.06]It's like, I... Like, too many... What the fuck even does over... What does overpower even do?
[44:31.45]What does it even do?
[44:33.21]Well, you see, it's 3% chance to have your health and your fortification combined data be used as a damage move.
[44:43.20]It's kind of confusing.
[44:45.58]Your brain is cooked eggs.
[44:46.94]I'm sorry, but I... I don't want to... Look, I just want to... I don't want to hurt... I just want to punch things.
[44:52.51]You need modern Diablo controls?
[44:54.11]I'll give you my Diablo take.
[45:01.89]So you're saying Ster was right.
[45:12.19]I don't- I actually don't know Ster's Diablo 4 take.
[45:16.93]I wonder what it is now.
[45:22.84]Nice microwaved egg head.
[45:27.76]Okay, when you- when you get a legendary that drops, and you look at it, and you- you need to read- I didn't even know what Lucky Hit did until I was like fucking level 25.
[45:36.18]I- what- what?
[45:40.41]And even still, I read up on it and I'm like, what the fuck is that?
[45:42.45]What does that even mean?
[45:43.41]What's happening?
[45:53.53]Alright.
[45:54.07]Fight and beat two people.
[45:55.50]Here we go.
[45:57.12]He does need modern controls.
[46:02.46]Oh, here he goes.
[46:03.16]Here he goes.
[46:03.74]Here he goes.
[46:05.50]Let's fight Hugo.
[46:10.51]You can use items during battle.
[46:18.42]Okay.
[46:20.68]I don't need items to fight a level one.
[46:22.10]I love how this guy was just probably on his way to work.
[46:35.05]It's not like jumping.
[46:36.09]Yeah.
[46:48.94]That would be so weird.
[46:50.52]Should I fight the level 9?
[46:52.42]Alright, is the level 9 going to kick the shit out of me?
[46:56.93]I'm going for it.
[47:09.39]I'm barely hurting this guy, but...
[47:20.74]Every Street Fighter thing I've ever seen is just keep the person over here.
[47:24.28]Just keep them over on this corner.
[47:40.39]This person's not fighting back.
[47:44.83]Why is he not fighting?
[47:47.19]He's not fighting!
[47:49.55]Why is he not attacking me?
[47:56.12]Is this a stream sniper?
[47:57.34]No, it... Uh oh.
[48:01.56]No, it's not a stream sniper.
[48:09.07]Don't you have to like juggle people too in these games?
[48:25.34]Alright, well, there it is.
[48:30.10]Are there damage numbers?
[48:34.08]Ster said the campaign is the worst he's ever played in any ARPG, but the gameplay loop is pretty fun, if shallow.
[48:44.43]Really?
[48:46.93]Oh, you level up, right?
[48:47.99]Right, right, right, right.
[48:48.63]Okay.
[48:50.05]Okay.
[48:52.93]You gain skill points upon leveling up if you access the status app in your device and choose skills.
[48:57.59]Ooh.
[48:57.81]Somebody said Ster of liked anthem.
[49:08.88]So, eh.
[49:11.32]Uh-oh.
[49:14.64]What do I do?
[49:15.84]Where's my phone?
[49:20.34]Settings, right?
[49:22.77]emotes and shortcuts standard emotes oh I got check me out okay cool um where didn't I level up customize your device can be personalized by changing your wallpaper let's do blue blue looks good
[49:48.14]Uh, items?
[49:49.12]Status, maybe?
[49:51.72]Check your styles and equipment gear.
[49:53.58]I don't think I have any gear.
[49:57.82]Luke's style is the only one I have.
[50:00.44]Okay, I don't... Ah, this is where you change moves.
[50:05.92]Alright, well, I only have two.
[50:06.79]There we go, skills.
[50:13.29]You level up.
[50:14.25]Cool.
[50:15.17]Carry's over.
[50:16.83]You would like to redo how you've unlocked?
[50:18.23]Okay.
[50:18.65]Alright, so what we got?
[50:20.09]Increases throw strength?
[50:21.14]Yup.
[50:22.36]I'm just gonna be a throw Andy.
[50:24.14]I'm gonna be un-fucking-bearable.
[50:27.60]Uh, punch.
[50:29.26]I'm not, like, wasting points, am I?
[50:35.34]Cool.
[50:35.76]Alright.
[50:38.30]Who holds their phone like that?
[50:41.21]Alright, did what you asked.
[50:44.82]So if you're going to start a fight with somebody, pick your opponent wisely.
[50:47.33]Anyway, I'll catch you two again sometime.
[51:04.21]Okay.
[51:04.87]Sometimes you get to talk to folks on the street and ask them for a fight.
[51:08.76]Think of it like saying hi on the street.
[51:10.20]It's only lots more punching.
[51:12.10]And if all that punching works up an appetite, go ahead and get yourself a bite.
[51:15.90]There's a food truck nearby.
[51:17.00]You'd never guess from the look of it, but they do a killer pizza.
[51:19.32]Pizza.
[51:24.61]Eating food is part of our training too.
[51:26.47]Is coach just messing with us?
[51:30.49]Let's do what he says.
[51:31.25]Okay.
[51:47.13]Let's go motherfucker.
[51:49.77]I want a free pizza Pepino watch out.
[52:13.22]That's funny.
[52:13.74]Oh
[52:16.94]Yeah, he's not fighting either.
[52:26.72]Look like the Beast Titan.
[52:30.60]He does look like the Beast Titan.
[52:31.93]Nice.
[52:37.55]Alright, I just beat the shit out of the pizza restaurant guy.
[52:45.21]Is that a bad thing?
[52:49.93]It's an X now.
[52:50.71]Is that bad?
[52:51.07]Oh, now we're just going to eat.
[52:58.05]Okay.
[53:01.23]There are two types of food.
[53:02.64]Used immediately and food used during battle.
[53:06.44]Food lineup changes from time to time, so check your map screen to see what's on the menu.
[53:13.92]What the hell am I looking at?
[53:15.16]Oh, it's pizza.
[53:15.85]Pizza.
[53:17.54]A pizza covered in asparagus and... Oh, no, no, no, no.
[53:24.12]Asparagus on pizza?
[53:25.32]No, we get pepperoni.
[53:33.91]I ate it?
[53:40.03]This is not the kind of food that athletes like this eat every day.
[53:50.94]Pizza is clearly like cheating or something.
[53:52.98]How do you compete with cheese this hot and gooey?
[53:55.36]I guess they do.
[54:03.48]What'd I tell you?
[54:04.32]Bomb pizza, huh?
[54:05.84]All pizza's good pizza, but the pepperoni gets my vote any day.
[54:09.22]If you ever run low on stamina, eating something will get you right back on your feet.
[54:12.56]Some food will have you hitting harder, moving faster.
[54:14.64]The works.
[54:15.62]Food can power you up in all kinds of ways, so don't be shy about expanding your palate.
[54:19.96]Now that you're done filling up, why don't you pay a visit to that nearby alley?
[54:23.80]I could be an actor.
[54:24.60]I could be an actor.
[54:25.26]I could be an actor.
[54:26.05]Oh, really?
[54:29.91]Okay.
[54:39.01]Go to that alley.
[54:39.57]Okay, by the way, that pizza was fucking gross.
[55:13.56]Whoa, what's going on?
[55:14.92]Why is he... I'm like disintegrating him.
[55:19.25]He's being fucking pulled out of the universe.
[55:25.83]What's wrong with him?
[55:34.58]Level up.
[55:34.82]What the fuck are you looking at?
[55:45.81]Oh shit!
[56:01.40]Who's next?
[56:03.54]You're beating up a granny?
[56:20.69]What the hell are you doing?
[56:21.93]You piece of shit.
[56:24.86]I'm smurfing, what does it look like?
[56:28.10]Oh, I can put points in.
[56:39.39]Do I have six points?
[56:45.65]I'll do max vitality.
[56:53.91]Oh, it's alright.
[56:57.03]What was the other one?
[56:58.59]Defense?
[56:59.23]It's kind of the same thing, just different ways, right?
[57:04.57]This is more complicated than Diablo 4's skill tree.
[57:10.01]Oh!
[57:10.35]Oh!
[57:22.03]I'm in a fucking weird mood today.
[57:23.31]I'm sorry.
[57:23.73]I haven't streamed in like two weeks.
[57:35.61]I need to wait to give my full opinion on D4.
[57:38.79]Look, I'm one of those people and I'm sorry about this.
[57:42.74]Why apologize?
[57:43.80]No, this is how I feel.
[57:44.74]Fuck it.
[57:47.33]Diablo II came out and nothing can ever compare and I and look oh you're old and oh yeah everything can't be as good rose colored glasses shut the fuck up right I get it but honestly I don't think they can even come close ever again I don't think anybody could come close ever again nobody could ever come close ever again it's just unfortunate it's the way it is
[58:18.31]I'm playing Diablo 4 right now and having fun.
[58:20.37]Cope.
[58:21.01]I'm having fun too.
[58:23.21]I didn't say I didn't like it.
[58:29.03]I didn't say it wasn't good.
[58:32.00]That's backtracking?
[58:32.78]No, I just told you that I need to play it more to get a real opinion.
[58:36.08]It's like a fucking 700 hour campaign.
[58:39.36]Or however long it is.
[58:40.26]That map is huge.
[58:43.00]Wait, when getting into battles in the city, you find yourself against multiple opponents at once.
[58:51.74]Okay.
[58:53.42]Oh, it's like 2v2?
[58:54.22]Alright, this is interesting.
[59:03.19]Oh, that guy was... These guys were weak.
[59:16.98]It's a giant Capcom symbol.
[59:23.73]Hello, you two.
[59:24.33]We meet again.
[59:24.81]Let me introduce you to my brothers, Tracy and Ryan.
[59:30.72]Luke asked us to give you a hand with your training.
[59:33.54]You know, get the whole family on board kind of deal.
[59:37.92]Hold on, someone's calling me out here.
[59:40.10]I gotta read it.
[59:41.22]You don't like Diablo II because it's better than the new games.
[59:44.66]You like it because you did it when you were a teenager after school instead of getting yelled at for doing it wrong by like 10,000 people.
[59:51.14]You can never go back to the mind you had the first time you played it.
[59:54.14]That's like, that's a good point.
[59:59.39]You know what I mean?
[59:59.95]That's true.
[60:07.92]The skill points.
[60:08.62]I don't know.
[60:09.02]There should be more of them.
[60:10.96]I don't like the five skill points that add like 2% damage.
[60:14.05]Give me more of that.
[60:15.17]I can't give you an opinion until I beat it.
[60:20.64]I need to give you a real opinion.
[60:22.62]Diablo II is probably number one ever of all time.
[60:25.66]Ever for me.
[60:26.97]I love that franchise.
[60:28.21]I love it.
[60:29.47]Give me some time to give you a real opinion on it.
[60:30.99]Because I don't know.
[60:31.99]It could be much more in-depth than I'm giving it credit for.
[60:35.99]He wants 10 skill points with 1% damage.
[60:40.95]That's not what I said.
[60:47.96]They're imitating the thugs around here.
[60:49.28]They hide their faces just like this.
[60:50.92]They're attacking folks left and right, so be careful out there.
[60:53.93]Are there random battles?
[60:55.15]That's funny.
[60:55.53]Okay.
[61:04.88]I can't give you an opinion.
[61:05.74]Gives an opinion.
[61:06.30]Well, that's my in... in process opinion.
[61:10.93]Right?
[61:11.11]That's my, like, review in... whatever they call it.
[61:16.83]Review in progress.
[61:17.81]There.
[61:20.18]You get attacked on sight.
[61:22.04]Their names are colored red.
[61:23.38]That's... okay.
[61:30.87]Sometimes the street will bring the fight to you.
[61:33.21]Bust out the self-defense.
[61:34.89]Trust me, there are some places you do not want to wander around unless you have got the chops.
[61:39.45]Okay.
[61:41.25]See, the sign for the apparel store.
[61:42.51]I want you to do something, do some shopping there.
[61:44.37]Okay.
[61:51.15]New clothes.
[61:55.37]He's a fast texter.
[62:07.07]It's all about the fight.
[62:08.17]Okay, buy clothing.
[62:08.97]Do I have enough money to buy clothing?
[62:17.40]Cool.
[62:17.94]Alright, I want a pair of jeans.
[62:19.26]Is this the only thing that's available?
[62:28.43]This is the only thing I can buy, is this hat.
[62:30.03]Okay.
[62:34.89]Okay.
[62:42.61]Well, alright.
[62:45.51]We both have the same hat.
[62:46.73]Are you going to kill five boars already?
[63:05.73]Cringe incoming.
[63:06.79]What do you mean cringe incoming?
[63:09.67]You're talking about me?
[63:12.38]Cringe, cringe, cringe.
[63:13.44]What's going on?
[63:21.87]Shop till you drop.
[63:23.29]Doesn't even matter if you're the fashionable type, to be honest.
[63:27.43]A little bit of attention to your outfit can make all the difference in a fight.
[63:30.49]And hey, doesn't it feel good when you find out that outfit just speaks to you?
[63:34.75]Cool.
[63:35.99]Let's wrap things up for the day.
[63:37.81]I'm wandering around the city as we speak.
[63:39.83]See if you can find me.
[63:44.33]Hey.
[63:46.31]OK.
[63:54.87]His ass is reading what?
[63:56.75]He's not playing.
[63:57.77]He's not really playing what he is.
[63:59.68]I am.
[63:59.94]Hi.
[64:09.30]How's the city treating you?
[64:10.84]Getting some practical experience on the streets?
[64:13.66]Coach, are we really getting stronger by running around like this?
[64:17.22]Doubting the wisdom of old Luke Sensei, are you?
[64:20.68]Let's see where you're at then.
[64:23.00]Don't worry about taking turns.
[64:24.64]Both of you.
[64:25.38]Let's go!
[64:25.74]Alright, let's go.
[64:29.38]I'm gonna jump.
[64:29.98]I'm gonna jump, kick, only grab.
[64:30.94]You do grabs only.
[64:31.58]Jump, kick, only grabs.
[64:33.10]Grabbing!
[64:33.60]Grabbing!
[64:33.97]Grabbing!
[64:35.19]Grabbing!
[64:37.48]Grabbed.
[64:37.82]I thought that guy in the back was about to jump in and punch us.
[64:45.41]Nice.
[65:10.71]Shit.
[65:12.97]Get in there and you do something.
[65:16.07]Oh my God, I keep getting caught.
[65:20.55]God damn it.
[65:24.25]Level 10.
[65:36.18]You know how to block?
[65:37.76]This is a... You're supposed to lose this.
[65:41.38]you hold back to block I know how to block I I played Street Fighter one when you were were you in a crib okay I played Street Fighter one when you were in a crib and then you come back with the confidence to go toe to toe with your lovable coach I guess that practical training paid off in spades am I right
[66:05.50]You want to make it in this world?
[66:07.76]You got to do what you can.
[66:09.54]Crying like crazy.
[66:11.16]Not let up.
[66:12.60]Not for a second.
[66:14.44]He's crying.
[66:15.08]It was a bad voice crack.
[66:16.26]It's okay, though.
[66:19.34]You just got to take it one step at a time.
[66:26.54]Yeah, I got to get rid of this beard.
[66:27.78]That first step you both took just now?
[66:34.59]Okay.
[66:34.83]Enrolled!
[66:35.34]We did it.
[66:39.00]You became Luke's student.
[66:50.01]You can now use his master action.
[67:04.20]Becoming the student of a legendary fighter grants you access to their style, which you can in turn use in battle.
[67:10.68]Each style includes moves specific to that legendary fighter.
[67:13.64]Seek out legendary fighters and find a style that works for you!
[67:17.13]Unique attacks are normal moves that possess special properties.
[67:20.11]How many you have and what they do depends on which master's style you're using.
[67:24.17]Unique attacks can be performed by using the left stick and an attack button together.
[67:29.95]But if you'd rather not worry about doing them accidentally, you can always remove them from your move list altogether.
[67:35.66]Just keep in mind that they're all usable by default.
[67:45.42]I have to read it.
[67:45.90]I have to know what I'm doing.
[67:48.27]You know what?
[67:49.69]You make a darn good team.
[67:52.32]I don't think it'd be the worst thing for you two to take on the world together.
[67:59.18]You've got a grade four reading?
[68:03.58]Absolutely.
[68:06.13]Okay.
[68:06.75]Go watch my sorcery playthrough.
[68:08.59]You tell me how good I am at reading and dictation.
[68:11.49]Then, the two of you can go and travel the world.
[68:15.37]You can really get to know each other.
[68:18.22]take on all comers seriously you'll have a blast speaking of which I'm sorry I can't I I need to be strong and I need to be it now I'm not like you I can't go around treating this like a game bosh come on coach I'm done with the course
[68:40.37]Look at the hat on.
[68:41.31]The cinematographer hates this character.
[68:46.18]They never line up a shot correctly.
[68:47.88]Always going to look wrong.
[69:07.42]I think he was hacking at Bosch.
[69:10.20]Chasing after strength in a mad rush is a recipe for disaster.
[69:13.43]Let's just hope he doesn't stumble down any weird rabbit holes.
[69:16.57]You know, to be honest, I don't consider myself much of a teacher.
[69:23.53]Prez said I was too much of a hothead.
[69:25.70]Had me teach new students to help chill me out a bit.
[69:28.24]I'm giving it the old college try, but maybe my methods could use a little work.
[69:33.92]Maybe that does it for today's lesson.
[69:37.09]I'll contact you using this sucker moving forward.
[69:40.91]Ah, that's right.
[69:41.57]If you see Alice, tell her I said thanks for helping out with the lesson plan, yeah?
[69:46.84]She's got a ton to teach you, so I hope you two don't beat each other up too much.
[69:56.22]Nah.
[69:59.15]Nah.
[70:01.51]Alright.
[70:09.42]Yeah.
[70:11.00]Not that impressive.
[70:13.38]I beat this guy's ass ten minutes ago.
[70:15.68]Came all the way over here just to thank little old me.
[70:26.76]Come on.
[70:28.00]It's been my pleasure.
[70:31.20]Your character sucks ass.
[70:32.52]Start over.
[70:33.09]No!
[70:36.50]Guys, this is like Elden Ring.
[70:38.82]I'm going to make like 15 characters eventually.
[70:42.20]Right?
[70:44.10]I'm going to get my first move in Elden Ring and just be like, nah, fuck this.
[70:47.50]I'm doing something else.
[70:49.57]I'm playing as like a... I'm doing pyromancy.
[70:51.93]Never mind.
[71:00.83]You're not touching this game after the stream.
[71:03.13]Oh yeah?
[71:04.69]Put a pull up.
[71:06.72]Put a poll up.
[71:08.10]Will I play this game again?
[71:10.52]After today.
[71:11.28]Yes or no?
[71:13.20]Put a poll up.
[71:14.20]Put your money where your mouth is.
[71:15.02]Let's see it.
[71:21.43]Yeah.
[71:21.77]Now cut to me.
[71:23.09]Cut to me at Evo.
[71:26.23]I've been screaming.
[71:27.11]The crowd is fucking electric.
[71:30.80]And there's a thumb cam down on my controller.
[71:34.16]Just like... Everyone stands up.
[71:40.67]Everyone's standing.
[71:42.95]And I flawless victory every opponent.
[71:50.03]Well, I'm not going to do that, but it'd be fun.
[71:53.40]Strength is something we all must find on our own.
[71:55.50]And in order to find it, you've got to talk to people.
[71:58.10]Just like you're doing now.
[72:06.66]Okay.
[72:08.91]Legends.
[72:10.47]Take my style, for example.
[72:11.97]I learned it from a fighter named Chun Li.
[72:14.39]If you're looking for a guidepost towards strength to call your very own, be well worth heading to Chinatown to meet with Chun Li and learn her style.
[72:33.22]Oh, shit, we had another raid.
[72:34.02]Yeah, I didn't even see it.
[72:36.28]I was too busy talking about Captain Planet or something.
[72:39.21]That was Sips.
[72:40.55]Sips came in with a raid.
[72:41.33]I don't know how long ago that was.
[72:43.09]Ten minutes, maybe?
[72:44.55]But, welcome.
[72:45.59]Thanks for the raid.
[72:47.17]Welcome, everybody.
[72:49.93]Points called miles are earned throughout the game by performing various actions.
[72:53.83]Ooh!
[72:54.95]Whoa!
[72:56.91]Wow!
[72:58.78]The city contains a wealth of things to see and do.
[73:01.58]You can chat with the people you meet, do part-time jobs for Zeni, or even find rare items in the most unexpected of places.
[73:09.89]Alright, let's go.
[73:11.59]I'm ready.
[73:17.80]Alright, what do I do first?
[73:41.43]Why is he only fighting pedestrians?
[73:49.34]This is a level 5.
[73:50.24]It's not my fault that... It's not my fault that that character stinks.
[74:00.94]Alright, what do I have?
[74:02.18]Items.
[74:04.32]Hard candy.
[74:05.64]You can lick your way to its nutritious center.
[74:08.02]30 seconds.
[74:11.42]Oh, this is in battle.
[74:14.38]Oh!
[74:16.22]Iron hard caramels?
[74:21.16]That sounds awful.
[74:26.81]Okay, so we need to go to Chinatown.
[74:38.22]Break your teeth, yeah.
[74:41.79]Wait, I can use the phone?
[74:43.89]Hey!
[74:46.65]You're gonna travel all over to get stronger from here on out, right?
[74:48.97]Probably as good a time as any to take the bus.
[74:52.24]Chinatown's that-a-way hard to miss its big gate.
[74:56.22]Anyway, good luck out there.
[74:58.36]Okay.
[74:59.50]Examining a bus stop for the first time.
[75:00.86]It'll become available as a fast travel location.
[75:04.23]The map on your device will allow you to travel there.
[75:05.85]Alright, so it's fast travel.
[75:07.09]Cool.
[75:08.79]So make sure you unlock every bus stop.
[75:13.19]Okay.
[75:15.41]Wait, there's pizza over here.
[75:18.77]Can I get by a car?
[75:23.92]Whoa!
[75:24.40]Whoa!
[75:36.73]Fight the mime?
[75:37.91]Where's there a mime?
[75:38.89]Fight the mime?
[75:44.32]I don't see a mime.
[75:56.93]Where's this mime?
[75:57.73]Is it a mime?
[76:03.84]Like the pizza guy again.
[76:05.26]No, I've already beaten him up twice.
[76:12.23]Oh, here's the mime.
[76:22.20]Like, do people know what I'm about to do?
[76:23.90]Do people just fight each other?
[76:38.95]Stop running away.
[76:47.80]The mime's not fighting.
[76:56.23]Ooh.
[77:03.46]The mime is talking.
[77:04.55]It's true.
[77:13.39]Ooh, punish counter.
[77:17.37]Cool.
[77:31.38]Level six.
[77:32.06]Let's go.
[77:37.27]Okay, earning enough of a style's EXP will cause that style's rank to increase.
[77:41.73]If you increase your style rank, your master in that style might teach you new moves the next time you talk to them.
[77:46.88]Oh, okay.
[77:48.64]Cool.
[77:51.20]While exploring the city, you may sometimes notice citizens with master icons attached to them.
[77:56.15]These citizens are talented fighters who use the moves of that icon's corresponding legendary fighter and will yield a large amount of style experience.
[78:03.73]Ooh, okay.
[78:07.20]Anybody have that?
[78:08.84]Or you?
[78:09.96]No.
[78:11.30]What about you?
[78:12.86]No.
[78:14.28]Uppercut somebody.
[78:19.06]I missed.
[78:19.46]Alright, let's go to Chinatown.
[78:29.57]So where's the bus?
[78:39.33]How do I how do I?
[78:41.65]Hello.
[78:44.05]Got a metro free pass, yes.
[78:46.53]Oh, I don't.
[78:51.35]So this is now just a travel point.
[78:52.61]Alright, so how do I get to?
[78:56.22]I just walk I guess.
[79:02.56]Can I get through fight these guys?
[79:08.72]That's terrifying.
[79:13.23]Oh shit.
[79:22.19]The Watcher?
[79:27.25]I'm a hero.
[79:28.39]I protect the city from the shadows.
[79:31.07]I sense destiny in our meeting here.
[79:33.83]Care to talk shop?
[79:35.04]And by shop I mean justice?
[79:37.52]Uh, yeah.
[79:39.87]Allow me to begin.
[79:40.45]It was once a young man seeking strength.
[79:44.18]He traveled here to Metro City.
[79:47.22]On his first night, he went in search of food to sate his empty stomach.
[79:52.31]But along the way, he encountered foul ruffians who stripped him of every of his possession.
[79:57.95]If the story ended there, it would be just another tale from the mean streets of Metro City.
[80:02.43]But all my friend ended did not.
[80:05.09]A martial artist intervened, aiming to strike down the rampaging ruffians.
[80:09.96]And strike them down he did.
[80:11.96]And they all lived happily ever after, perhaps, had the story ended there.
[80:15.64]You see, the fighter chose to re- leave the gang members of their money.
[80:20.60]It was their reward for winning, you see.
[80:22.42]In that very moment, the young man had an epiphany.
[80:27.15]Martial artists and gang goons are cut from the same cloth.
[80:31.81]Strike down evil is a righteous act.
[80:33.29]Alright, you wanna go?
[80:36.90]That's not enough.
[80:37.86]One's reasons for striking down evil and their sportsmanship afterward are equally important.
[80:42.98]When you raise your fist, you must do so for just and meaningful purposes.
[80:47.15]You're a fighter, hmm?
[80:47.85]Is there meaning guiding your fists?
[80:51.63]I don't know yet.
[80:53.49]Hmm, I see.
[80:54.95]You'll find a clear answer to that question in time, I imagine.
[80:57.82]You must never forget to fight with a spirit of righteousness.
[81:00.46]Ah, listen to me blabbing.
[81:02.26]I'm sorry about that.
[81:03.42]Here it is.
[81:03.70]Thanks for listening to my story.
[81:04.72]No need to be shy now.
[81:05.64]Take it.
[81:07.40]Ooh.
[81:07.64]Okay.
[81:11.27]Bully Restores Vitality and Drive Gauge.
[81:16.46]Well, now I'm going to kick the shit out of you.
[81:24.08]Capcom, man!
[81:54.34]Alright, this is bullshit, but it's working.
[81:55.84]Alright, would I get booed?
[82:07.62]Would I get booed if I was doing this in a tournament?
[82:20.77]Whoa, what happened?
[82:21.69]Oh, he countered it.
[82:28.31]Not if it was working.
[82:29.33]A win is a win.
[82:34.58]Okay, yeah.
[82:40.44]Are there any diminishing returns?
[82:49.11]I'm gonna level up like five times after beating this guy.
[83:07.13]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[83:20.21]Am I actually going to level up a shitload of times?
[83:22.09]Uh-oh, bad.
[83:25.63]This is bad.
[83:27.01]This is really bad.
[83:27.57]I don't know what he's doing.
[83:30.89]Why did I go against... Why did I go against the fucking formula?
[83:33.90]Why did I do that?
[83:34.64]That was stupid.
[83:35.40]I could have beat him.
[83:36.99]I don't know why I got bored.
[83:40.25]Let me continue.
[83:44.19]Somebody ResidentSleepers and I freaked out and had to punch him twice.
[83:47.37]I'm not even gonna look at chat.
[83:58.42]God damn it, whatever.
[84:07.35]Okay, well at least it shows them on the map.
[84:17.36]I'll be back.
[84:24.24]What?
[84:27.12]What the fuck did I just do to that guy?
[84:30.08]Who am I fighting?
[84:30.78]Oh, it's 2v1.
[84:31.44]Alright.
[84:36.10]That was not even a... That was simple.
[84:42.33]Nice.
[84:42.57]That looks awful.
[84:52.20]You were at the very bottom of the bag of cheese and you were like, you know what?
[84:55.80]I already have the dough out and I already have the sauce out.
[84:59.28]I have to make it work.
[85:00.92]There's like 15 strands of cheese left.
[85:08.61]Stop being mean.
[85:09.99]I just don't like that.
[85:10.63]I don't like pizza like that.
[85:12.81]I have to have perfect level.
[85:15.11]Of perfect level of cheese.
[85:17.73]And sauce.
[85:18.45]Three V1.
[85:22.10]Oh shit.
[85:39.89]This guy's level 14 and 15.
[85:41.55]How am I going to beat this?
[85:43.05]I'm kind of doing it though.
[85:46.42]Is there another one?
[85:52.18]How many people are there in this?
[86:08.27]That was pretty good.
[86:14.38]No!
[86:14.96]God damn it.
[86:15.74]I fucking knew it was going to hit me.
[86:25.57]Shit.
[86:26.05]He has level 15.
[86:27.57]Alright, I'm going to Chinatown.
[86:39.22]Oh, that's right.
[86:39.70]I have items.
[86:40.56]I can take them in the middle of a fight, right?
[86:44.45]When are you going to play the actual game?
[86:46.61]This is the game.
[86:48.83]Are you asking when I'm going to play multiplayer online matches?
[86:53.72]The hell?
[86:55.04]I don't know.
[86:57.68]This is what I wanted to play.
[86:59.44]What, so you can stream snipe me and beat me in fucking 10 seconds?
[87:02.76]That's what you want.
[87:04.22]That's why you want me to do that.
[87:08.39]You're sitting there hovering over the join match button.
[87:11.89]It's like, oh, I hope I get queued up with him so I can literally do one combo and kill him.
[87:23.13]Of course.
[87:34.27]You can fight with your creator characters?
[87:35.66]That's awesome.
[87:37.12]I'll definitely do it.
[87:54.21]IRL Street Fighter?
[88:04.27]Whoa.
[88:09.95]Chun-Li?
[88:11.01]Could I get a selfie?
[88:18.10]Just real quick.
[88:19.34]Real quick.
[88:27.11]Sorry for the trouble.
[88:28.55]I didn't mean to get you involved.
[88:37.09]I'm Chun Ling.
[88:39.21]Is there something I can help you with?
[88:44.04]Teach me.
[88:51.26]There actually is a selfie system.
[88:53.34]That's funny.
[88:54.76]Okay.
[89:00.42]I had a long career as a fighter myself.
[89:02.16]I faced all kinds of opponents that include fiercely powerful foes and friends forged in the fires of competition.
[89:08.79]I'm apparently uninterested.
[89:14.75]After all these years of fighting, I decided it might be time for a break.
[89:16.85]That's why I'm here teaching the locals Kung Fu.
[89:20.45]I can't promise it will provide you with the strength you're looking for, but I'm happy to teach you a thing or two.
[89:24.50]Okay.
[89:41.42]This really is just a random character.
[89:43.77]Every button was pressed and randomized.
[89:47.15]There was no thought that went into this at all.
[90:05.92]Alright.
[90:27.81]Oh, not good enough.
[90:29.43]Not good enough.
[90:31.11]Wow, so epic.
[90:39.39]Alright.
[90:43.65]So now I can use Chun Li's moves.
[90:49.02]Ooh.
[90:52.92]Spinning bird kick.
[91:00.98]So you have, you can only use a certain style at once.
[91:03.76]You can't combine moves.
[91:04.76]Okay.
[91:10.38]Oh, wait, no.
[91:11.24]Alright.
[91:15.18]Ooh.
[91:16.26]So I can combine them.
[91:21.47]Oh, shit.
[91:21.91]That's actually pretty cool.
[91:22.81]Alright.
[91:26.23]Let me do that.
[91:30.17]Special moves.
[91:33.43]So do I want rising uppercut or do I want the flash knuckle?
[91:47.90]I think I want the range.
[91:49.15]I want this.
[91:49.57]I like this move.
[92:03.71]Alright, so this is forward and this is just standard.
[92:07.88]Okay, that's right.
[92:09.24]Let's go.
[92:24.83]Alright, how do I do it?
[92:28.87]How do I do it?
[92:31.67]Whoa, how do I just do that?
[92:32.69]Am I missing something?
[92:44.96]Hold back and then forward.
[92:53.62]Back, forward.
[92:55.18]Back, forward.
[92:56.70]Back, forward.
[92:59.36]Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Forward special.
[93:09.32]Forward Y. Forward Y. Uh, what's happening here?
[93:14.18]You have to charge it for a bit?
[93:35.20]Yeah, but I'm on modern controls.
[93:36.54]Okay, hold on, let me go.
[93:37.28]Wait.
[93:41.05]Back?
[93:41.75]Forward?
[93:42.11]Yeah, but isn't it modern?
[93:51.57]Hold back, press Y. Hold forward, press Y. Okay.
[93:59.81]It's just forward Y. Forward Y. Forward Y. Forward Y. Why is it not working?
[94:07.35]Hold forward Y. I'm just... I'm doing it.
[94:14.76]Hold back and press special.
[94:16.32]It's not doing it either.
[94:17.58]I don't even know how the fuck I just did that.
[94:22.86]I...
[94:30.10]I tried every single combination.
[94:34.13]Hold for one second, then forward.
[94:35.81]I did that like probably 30 times in a row.
[94:40.23]I don't understand what's going on.
[94:51.23]You weren't holding back for long enough.
[94:53.28]How come I'm all the way back here?
[94:58.78]Where's the moves list?
[94:59.66]I'm so far away.
[95:09.77]Charge inputs are not easy.
[95:20.16]I wasn't holding back for long enough.
[95:36.58]You can check who you're studying.
[95:39.67]Got it.
[95:39.99]Alright.
[95:40.53]Let me try this again.
[95:45.47]One.
[95:46.63]Okay.
[95:47.81]Holding one.
[95:48.61]I'm holding back.
[95:49.27]Forward Y. Hold forward.
[95:51.33]Back Y. Don't move at all.
[95:54.54]Press Y. Back forward Y. Back forward Y. Back forward Y.
[96:06.12]Down, back, Y. One, two, three, forward, Y.
[96:35.71]I don't get it.
[96:36.68]Press Y while holding forward.
[96:39.36]That's what I'm doing right now.
[96:41.08]What just happened right there?
[96:42.66]Hold Y. Forward.
[96:44.86]Okay, it's only walking forward.
[96:47.44]It's walk forward for two seconds and then Y. Not back forward Y. Back forward Y. You have to walk forward for a full almost two seconds.
[96:57.57]Like that.
[96:59.85]Or back.
[97:00.21]Nope.
[97:01.29]Back does not work.
[97:06.89]I feel like that's not very good.
[97:07.87]Yeah, if I... Okay, I'm going to hold back.
[97:18.78]One, two, three.
[97:20.84]Doesn't do anything.
[97:21.96]I'm holding forward.
[97:22.88]One, one, two, three.
[97:25.08]Yeah, it's forward only.
[97:32.79]I feel like I would want to do the regular controls for that one.
[97:35.81]I wonder if I could do it...
[97:37.95]I probably should just play with the regular controls.
[97:39.51]Hold forward while crouching.
[97:48.20]Ah, now, now you got it.
[97:58.11]There we go.
[97:58.93]Yeah.
[98:12.48]You bumped into me.
[98:13.58]Sorry, buddy.
[98:19.85]Or what?
[98:22.23]Yeah, I don't like that at all.
[98:32.16]I think I was going to play with the regular controls.
[98:46.16]Do I do it in here?
[98:48.64]Controls, right?
[98:52.46]Uh, modern.
[98:53.20]Let's do classic.
[98:54.32]Let's try it.
[98:54.68]So forward, back, Y. Forward, back, Y.
[99:17.77]Forward, back, Y. Forward, back, Y. Forward, back, Y. Forward, back, Y. Forward, back, Y. Back, forward.
[99:31.20]Forward, back, X. Forward, back, X. Forward, back, X. Forward, back.
[99:40.24]Wait, what?
[99:42.62]Why did I get rid of my... Did it take it off?
[99:54.78]I need to re-equip it.
[100:17.90]That combo, Omega Lull.
[100:20.36]Relax, okay?
[100:21.68]I don't play Street Fighter.
[100:23.14]I don't play Street Fighter.
[100:24.96]You need to calm down.
[100:26.42]Don't Omega Lull combo me.
[100:30.25]I'm going back to Modern so people don't make fun of me.
[100:33.93]I gotta go back to Modern so people don't make fun of me.
[100:39.61]What is wrong with that?
[100:47.63]Learn new actions from every master you study under.
[100:49.75]Cool.
[100:54.67]Street Fighter chat is toxic.
[100:57.85]No!
[100:58.47]What the hell can you do?
[101:00.07]What?
[101:00.35]I kind of want to learn that.
[101:05.99]That seems ridiculous.
[101:09.01]Okay.
[101:15.97]Well, I definitely want to do that.
[101:25.68]Alright, special moves.
[101:29.38]What happened?
[101:29.90]Oh, this is how I do this.
[101:31.80]Alright.
[101:32.08]Alright, so forward.
[101:37.42]Back.
[101:38.28]Doesn't do it.
[101:39.14]Back.
[101:40.24]It's only forward.
[101:41.79]It's only Y. I'm gonna get you.
[101:47.97]Ouch!
[101:49.47]Ouch!
[101:50.37]Ouch!
[101:56.28]Now I'm angry.
[101:59.46]Ouch.
[102:01.56]Ouch.
[102:05.90]Anybody know what that is?
[102:06.68]How do I get out of here?
[102:11.58]Alright.
[102:24.05]Down, up.
[102:33.99]Yeah, wouldn't that cool?
[102:34.97]Alright, so how do I do it?
[102:48.80]It's forward and then Y, right?
[103:09.63]Oh shit, I'm gonna lose.
[103:19.29]No, we're good, we're good.
[103:25.35]Alright, cool.
[103:27.47]I'm just leveling up.
[103:28.34]Alright, I'm gonna, we'll do a little bit more and then I'm gonna take it online.
[103:36.91]And they get destroyed for a little while.
[103:39.39]And you can all laugh.
[103:40.79]Everybody can clip the moments where I get flawless and... You know what I mean?
[103:46.37]Like, we'll do that.
[103:48.99]We'll do that in like 10 minutes.
[103:59.06]Am I not on Chun-Li's style?
[104:04.42]Oh...
[104:25.67]Are you ready?
[104:27.79]Holy shit.
[105:00.27]Hold forward and why?
[105:01.25]Oh, it's different because it's a different character.
[105:02.97]Dude, Jerma sucks at fighting games.
[105:08.22]That's fine.
[105:09.22]I'm going to have my fun playing the game.
[105:13.46]You can get good.
[105:14.30]You can get to rank two, whatever you want to get to.
[105:32.86]Alright, anything else to do?
[105:35.08]Oh, you.
[105:38.96]Sup.
[105:44.07]Get to rank 10.
[105:47.35]Should I do the thing?
[105:48.21]That people are going to be so pissed off though.
[105:51.57]When I play online, you guys are going to hear a lot of this.
[105:56.79]Because I'm just going to hit every single button.
[105:59.50]And I know that people hate that, but
[106:03.54]He's a masher, I know.
[106:04.73]I'll try.
[106:06.29]It's okay, I do that too.
[106:17.80]Yeah, I think a lot of us do.
[106:26.98]Okay.
[106:28.10]Only you can discover the style that's truly yours.
[106:30.90]And the only time you can do that is in combat.
[106:33.45]I gotta put some clothing on.
[106:35.23]Okay.
[106:45.96]Do you mind keeping an eye?
[106:48.84]Uh, talented.
[106:51.58]Okay.
[106:52.00]Alright.
[106:53.48]Alright.
[107:01.27]That full body is... Alright, I can at least put pants on.
[107:05.54]There we go.
[107:15.85]I still have to learn how to do supers and stuff and drive gauge and... I don't know how to do any of that.
[107:26.21]Okay.
[107:36.62]You don't get it until chapter 6.
[107:37.62]Should I take it online?
[107:39.34]What do you think?
[107:39.78]Are we taking it online?
[107:52.89]Let's go.
[108:02.73]Hit up the basic tutorial.
[108:03.97]Alright.
[108:05.25]I love this mode.
[108:05.89]I'm definitely gonna play it off stream.
[108:07.95]Wait, did you guys do a poll?
[108:15.17]To determine if I was gonna play this ever again.
[108:16.59]What was the... What was the percentages?
[108:26.47]Okay.
[108:27.63]Multiple online space to play... Okay, let's go.

[108:59.80]I'm not ready.
[109:00.38]I am not ready.
[109:01.20]Wait, are these other players?
[109:02.82]He's going to rage quit?
[109:05.70]No, I won't.
[109:29.16]Do we have a face cam for this?
[109:30.24]You want to see me, my face when I lose.
[109:31.94]Yeah, we'll do it in a minute.
[109:33.26]Hold on.

[109:37.74]Each one has a handy little instruction pop-up.
[109:40.68]So don't be nervous.
[109:44.08]Look at that.
[109:44.62]Look at that devil.
[109:46.50]Look at that devil.

[119:22.18]Can we just take everybody to the arcade or something?
[119:28.10]Can we just go ride rides at an amusement park?
[119:37.57]Oh my goodness.

[122:13.45]Look at this person's health.
[122:15.11]Is this for real?
[122:18.23]Is that their health bar?
[122:22.09]What?
[122:26.18]You don't have three health bars, do you?
[122:30.85]This person has thr- how is this possible?
[122:43.07]How'd I do that?
[122:46.82]How do I do that move?
[122:53.88]That's so unfair!
[122:55.12]This guy's getting two extra health bars.
[122:59.27]What the hell?
[123:04.73]Alright, I'm going to play as a different... I want to play as a character.
[123:07.33]Okay, character.

[129:58.64]It's alright.
[129:58.96]It's alright.
[130:01.32]Oh, come on.

[130:09.23]Yeah.
[130:15.01]It's fine.
[130:15.55]I don't know what the fuck's going on.
[130:16.91]It doesn't matter.
[130:17.41]I'm having fun.
[130:18.47]Alright.
[130:23.19]I want to play as a different character.
[130:32.99]I'm going to sit at this one.
[130:37.78]You all fell for it.
[130:50.81]Okay.
[130:53.97]Tutorial would help you a lot.
[130:55.11]Yeah, I know.
[131:02.30]Because I know there's like a parry.
[131:04.36]There's that paint move where you paint.
[131:06.49]There's a whole super meter thing.
[131:09.25]There's a whole thing here.
[131:33.35]Shit.
[131:35.47]That did a lot of damage, holy shit.
[131:49.82]Ow!
[131:50.80]What the fuck?
[131:59.85]The only way to get good is slamming your head against the brick wall.
[132:04.82]Ooh.
[132:49.04]Give me that grab.
[132:49.50]Give me the grab.
[132:57.41]Oh no!
[133:10.74]What the hell was that?
[133:11.86]Manon wins!
[133:22.05]Alright, I'll be back.
[133:24.75]I'm gonna go do the tutorial.
[133:26.27]Alright, everybody come over here.
[133:39.50]Stand right here, facing this direction.
[133:42.54]Right here, facing this direction, please.
[133:45.61]Okay.
[133:48.61]Stand here and face me, please.
[133:55.36]No, not in front of me.
[133:56.40]Over on the white line.
[133:59.16]Okay.
[134:00.28]So... Everybody come over here.
[134:04.93]Only, like, ten of you are actually listening.
[134:06.95]I feel like I've had dreams where this was what was happening.
[134:15.77]Okay, you ready?
[134:21.02]I'm telling you, we're going to play something here.
[134:22.62]You ready?
[134:22.92]Ready?
[134:24.61]Simon says walk one step forward.
[134:31.93]Nice.
[134:32.52]Nice.
[134:32.86]Okay.
[134:34.94]Step back.
[134:38.96]Ah!
[134:40.00]You... You moved a little.
[134:42.00]You moved a little.
[134:42.92]Alright.
[134:43.66]Now let's fucking go.
[134:44.43]How do I challenge this?
[134:55.15]Alright, Simon says do a full lap around the whole hub.
[134:59.67]Back here.
[135:09.52]Well, y'all lose.
[135:10.46]Are you taking a picture?
[135:16.66]Taking a selfie?
[135:18.00]Oh, hold on a minute.
[135:27.21]Oh shit, I just hit like 5 people.
[135:28.89]Is that bad?
[135:29.31]Alright, I'm going to go learn how to play the game.
[135:41.22]I'll be right back.
[135:41.70]I'll be right back.
[135:46.83]I'm just going to learn how to play the game.
[136:00.92]Alright, let's go.
[136:01.44]Alright, we know how to do this.
[136:05.98]We know how to do this.
[136:06.70]We know how to do this.
[136:07.44]We know how to do this.
[136:08.24]We know how to do this.
[136:09.28]What's this?
[136:09.64]Let's do a quick review of drive impacts.
[136:19.46]If your opponent's in the corner and you hit them, the drive impact... Okay.
[136:29.89]Okay, so...
[136:32.01]There is some situation where this crush state won't occur.
[136:37.73]Okay, well, I think we have to go back a few steps.
[136:48.00]Here we go.
[136:53.29]alright the drive gauge these are powerful up special moves that consume two drive gauge blocks I'm using a special move that is an overdrive version press okay instead of one of the alright overdrive arts have different properties than their standard counterparts just do the first one god damn it
[137:29.75]Okay.
[137:31.89]Dashing?
[137:32.67]Yep.
[137:35.34]Why am I on classic?
[137:43.30]How come I can't change this?
[137:45.40]Why does this keep changing?
[137:50.88]Why does this keep changing?
[138:00.75]You pick the classic tutorial.
[138:05.47]Oh, come on.
[138:06.11]Alright.
[138:18.80]I'll get it in 10 minutes.
[138:21.42]And then I'm going back in there and I'm going to dominate.
[138:29.90]Yep.
[138:30.32]It's dashing.
[138:31.20]Cool.
[138:31.42]Cool.
[138:32.72]Jumping.
[138:33.32]Yep.
[138:35.64]Okay.
[138:36.04]Good jumps.
[138:37.80]Normal attacks.
[138:38.66]Yep.
[138:42.58]Yep.
[138:46.23]Yep.
[138:48.95]Yep.
[138:50.85]Uh-huh.
[138:52.47]Okay.
[138:54.71]Down.
[138:55.59]Yep.
[138:58.41]Jump.
[138:58.79]Yep.
[139:07.46]Yep.
[139:10.98]Standing block and crouching block.
[139:12.73]That's good to know.
[139:13.23]I didn't know that.
[139:13.79]Uh-huh.
[139:21.93]See?
[139:22.27]I'm getting it.
[139:22.93]Okay, crouch block.
[139:32.22]Yeah, I don't think you would have figured that out right away.
[139:34.46]Yep.
[139:39.20]Okay.
[139:46.44]Throw escape by pressing X and A at the same time.
[139:49.63]Check your timing.
[139:50.27]Escape my throw.
[139:54.81]Oh, that's how you do it.
[139:55.77]Alright.
[139:56.25]Nice.
[140:02.63]Okay.
[140:04.13]Yep.
[140:04.93]Special moves.
[140:09.11]Rising uppercut.
[140:11.01]Oh.
[140:14.33]Mm-hmm.
[140:17.03]Mm-hmm.
[140:19.14]Okay, here we go.
[140:19.90]This is it.
[140:20.36]Three levels.
[140:24.04]If you have at least one, you can perform a super art.
[140:27.46]Level one super art.
[140:29.16]Okay.
[140:29.28]Okay.
[140:31.45]Level 1 super art with either of these.
[140:33.01]Forward B and Y. This is a level 1 super art.
[140:38.21]It's forward B and Y. Level 2.
[140:43.04]Short range.
[140:44.98]So it's... Press... Away from your opponent.
[140:49.74]So you gotta go like wham.
[140:51.56]Okay.
[140:52.74]Yep.
[140:56.45]Alright.
[140:56.67]So you gotta go like wham.
[141:00.12]Modern control screen.
[141:01.56]Omega low.
[141:03.18]No, that's fine.
[141:04.08]Look, if you know that I'm already using modern controls, you probably left the stream like an hour ago.
[141:08.43]That's fine.
[141:09.27]It's all good.
[141:15.23]So you go... Alright, I get it now.
[141:23.62]So that's how you do that.
[141:24.48]But what about the left bumper thing I was pressing?
[141:27.74]Sure, we'll get it right now.
[141:30.30]Okay.
[141:31.70]There it is.
[141:32.20]Alright.
[141:32.42]The six bar display shown here is known as the boy.
[141:36.28]It indicates a fighter's concentration energy level.
[141:39.04]Utilizing this gauge lets you perform unique actions.
[141:41.16]Okay.
[141:45.79]First off is the drive impact.
[141:47.07]Press left bumper to perform a powerful attack.
[141:48.97]Just left bumper.
[141:50.09]Got it.
[141:50.75]So they use this one cube.
[141:54.84]They can absorb two attacks from the opponent, but there are some exceptions.
[141:57.85]When you're in trouble, use the drive impact to break through and attack.
[142:03.31]Oh, so that's how you stop somebody from doing a combo.
[142:06.08]Okay, didn't I just do it?
[142:18.21]I'm not doing it?
[142:25.48]Press A dude.
[142:28.08]Oh.
[142:31.60]While I'm blocking.
[142:34.32]So it goes through block.
[142:35.78]Alright.
[142:39.78]So it's mainly to get out of combos.
[142:41.98]I was using it as like a punch.
[142:45.59]Drive parry.
[142:46.39]Okay.
[142:53.39]Okay.
[142:59.23]So that's how you replenish the gauge.
[143:02.45]They cannot defend against throws.
[143:06.89]Try them out in a real fight.
[143:07.73]While I perform a dry parry, press X and A at the same time to throw me.
[143:13.85]Yep.
[143:14.49]Okay.
[143:17.64]You don't want to use it in combos.
[143:20.30]Perfect parry is performing a dry parry the moment an opponent attacks hits you.
[143:25.12]Okay.
[143:28.84]Alright.
[143:31.67]Drive impacts are powerful to use for any fighter.
[143:33.29]Okay.
[143:38.31]So drive, you can use drive parry.
[143:43.57]Got it.
[143:46.56]Too much information.
[143:47.28]I'm going to go hit my sandbag.
[143:52.72]So parrying is insanely important, especially if you're in the corner.
[144:07.65]Yep.
[144:13.60]Okay.
[144:15.56]Burnout.
[144:16.02]The drive impact and drive parry are great uses of the drive gauge, but continuous use will drain the gauge, and if you drain it completely, you'll be unable to use it for a period of time.
[144:24.52]Alright.
[144:25.04]So that's why I thought I was on drugs.
[144:31.52]And you get stunned.
[144:32.42]Okay.
[144:40.82]Alright.
[144:43.86]When a fighter is in burnout, they can still be stunned even if they block a drive impact.
[144:47.62]Remember, chasing someone into the corner gives you more chances.
[144:49.96]Alright.
[144:51.84]I think I got it now.
[144:53.09]I think I'm good.
[144:57.37]Okay.
[144:57.69]I'm ready.
[144:57.95]Okay.
[145:05.31]Yeah, I'm good to go.
[145:09.75]Name one move that was introduced.
[145:11.39]Drive parry, drive gauge, drive impacts, special one, special two, and special three.
[145:16.94]Special two is hit back and press Y and B. Special three is crouch and hit Y and B. I paid attention.
[145:24.94]Ban that person for 25 minutes.
[145:36.35]There it is.
[145:36.81]There it is.
[146:07.01]I got it now.
[146:08.71]I got it now.
[146:10.65]What happens when your drive gauge is empty?
[146:12.10]You get you get into dazed mode and you get you can get stunned.
[146:15.20]I win and that person for four hours.
[146:28.83]Go back to the hub.
[146:46.66]I love that you can just kind of hang out here.
[146:49.14]Doing tournaments like this would be so much fun.
[146:51.64]You actually can participate.
[146:52.60]I definitely don't want to fight the person that has three boss health bars.
[147:10.89]Hey dude, I bet you can't recite the first 20 lines of Pi.
[147:16.47]Um... Wait, the Pi the math problem?
[147:22.08]Was it three, um... Three point... One, four... One, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, nine.
[147:47.67]Oh my god.
[147:51.11]Stage select?
[147:51.85]Ooh, hold on.
[147:52.57]Where do I want to go?
[147:55.15]Colosseum?
[147:57.82]Wait, I think I'm still Blanka, aren't I?
[148:01.92]Wait, no.
[148:03.00]No, it's this guy again.
[148:04.48]I don't want to fight this person.
[148:06.22]They have too much... Alright, well, I learned a lot, so let's go.
[148:19.74]Wait, I don't have any drive powers.
[148:21.11]This is just a level up version of my character.
[149:16.76]fucking unpredictable oh no no no no no no no I still have health
[150:02.36]Dude, why can't I do special moves anymore?
[150:05.82]I'm pressing Y, it's not doing anything.
[150:10.35]What the fuck are my moves?
[150:14.19]I don't have any moves?
[150:41.65]how do I not have a move to do oh it's because I'm story locked alright I get it
[151:03.45]I don't even have a super meter.
[151:06.93]Oh shit.
[151:08.05]Okay, I gotta get out of here.
[151:10.69]Okay, let me play the regular game now.
[151:20.48]Jesus.
[151:28.81]Here comes a new challenger.
[151:34.22]I'll try Blanka again.
[151:35.19]Alright, here we go.
[151:42.62]Now I know how to play.
[152:25.94]What?
[152:27.98]What?
[152:33.74]Oh, I'm not even in matchmaking.
[152:40.43]This person might have a hundred hours in this game.
[152:44.05]Right?
[152:44.97]Is that accurate?
[152:55.38]LOL, he's using... No, I'm not.

[153:37.48]I'm going to matchmaking.
[153:40.91]I'm going to matchmaking.
[153:50.11]That was fun.
[153:51.07]Everyone... Good job, all of you.
[153:53.17]Thanks for playing.
[153:56.77]Alright, I'm going to go do matchmaking to play against the real players of my skill level.
[154:03.25]It was very, very good job.
[154:04.57]Nice work.

[154:36.61]Hmm.
[154:38.87]E. Honda?
[154:39.73]What the?
[155:01.47]I know if I play this character, I'm going to spam X and people are going to get really mad at me.
[155:15.11]I'll, alright, I'm doing E-Honda.
[155:16.65]Fuck it, let's go.
[155:17.37]Okay.

[157:28.03]Thank God, finally.
[157:32.93]Should I do a rematch?
[157:37.52]I think you're right.
[157:38.44]This is a computer.
[157:39.20]How is this a computer?
[157:56.43]It's for placement.
[157:57.81]Oh, alright.
[157:58.21]I get it.
[158:08.99]I'm going to have to put a chick in the league.
[158:18.19]No, I'm not.
[158:18.73]That's fine.
[158:24.12]That wasn't terrible.
[158:45.17]Look, I gotta do more grabs.
[158:46.46]Way more grabs.
[158:47.20]Shit.
[158:52.82]Alright.
[159:09.69]You're getting better?
[159:11.83]That's good to hear.
[159:14.34]It's fun.
[159:15.62]Back special is your best move.
[159:18.74]Okay, so now that's it, right?
[159:22.29]Quit?
[159:26.11]Uh... Pervious mode?
[159:34.88]How do I just keep going?
[159:41.38]You gotta learn the headbutt.
[159:44.71]Okay, ranked match.
[159:46.55]I think it's still happening.
[159:49.01]Okay, cool.
[159:51.47]Let's swarm his body and vibrate him to death like we're bees.
[159:58.95]Okay.
[160:10.72]Hello?
[160:19.51]This is a real fight.
[160:20.86]This is a real person.
[160:22.66]Shit.
[160:45.18]Ooh.
[160:46.42]He's caught up in a combo.
[160:47.62]Caught up in a combo.
[160:49.34]Stop screaming for no reason.
[160:50.65]Like, what am I doing?
[160:51.79]This guy's quick.
[161:00.45]Ow.
[161:12.20]Alright.
[161:20.25]That's a grab?
[161:20.95]What kind of move is that?
[161:34.32]Back in YB, right?
[161:37.58]Why won't he do it?
[161:45.82]How come I can't do my special move?
[161:49.23]Back in YB, back YB, back YB.
[161:51.27]Why is it not working?
[161:54.23]Why is it not working?
[162:00.90]I had three bars.
[162:02.08]Why couldn't I do back YB?
[162:04.46]I had three bars.
[162:07.68]Back YB is two bar.
[162:10.08]Didn't I have three?
[162:17.20]You're on the right.
[162:18.58]I was doing back YB.
[162:20.17]I promise you.
[162:21.79]It's different inputs for every character.
[162:23.39]Oh, come on.
[162:24.03]Really?
[162:24.43]Alright.
[162:24.73]Well, I have no idea how to do them.
[162:51.57]God damn it, I'm just not fast enough.
[163:02.07]Come on.
[163:06.31]Jesus.
[163:09.71]What the fuck?
[163:24.53]This guy's got insane zoning moves.
[163:26.77]Is this like an S tier character?
[163:27.99]I feel like he is.
[163:34.48]I just did back YB and it didn't do anything.
[163:36.14]Whatever.
[163:36.44]Is this a genre of video game?
[163:50.85]that I've put maybe collectively four hours of time into.
[163:56.92]It's Street Fighter.
[164:05.46]I almost did it.
[164:05.96]I need new character.
[164:22.82]Don't clap for me.
[164:23.70]I didn't win!
[164:24.34]Imagine coming out.
[164:27.94]I can do that too.
[165:24.16]Yo!
[165:42.77]Oh good, good counter.
[165:47.81]Oh shit.
[166:02.64]Back it up.
[166:08.46]I'm stunned, I'm stunned, I'm stunned.
[166:09.50]I gotta back it up.
[166:17.29]Shit, that's bad.
[166:43.33]I won... I won one match.
[166:47.94]I gotta figure out how to do the other move.
[166:57.31]Ooh, alright, I should've blocked it.
[167:25.10]Uh-oh.
[167:36.15]This game's fun.
[167:38.03]Even if I'm not very good at it.
[167:39.75]I'm learning though.
[167:40.93]I'm getting better.
[167:41.55]Oh, nice job.
[167:51.70]Good job.
[168:02.08]Shit.
[168:10.37]Shit.
[168:16.33]Jump!
[168:16.67]Jump out of the way!
[168:17.47]I'm dead.
[168:17.95]Alright, that was better.
[168:30.22]I could do combo try.
[168:31.54]Yeah, I mean, I could learn really genuinely how to play a character, but I'm just having fun.
[168:35.59]It's all good.
[168:47.82]Got it.
[168:48.92]It's down.
[168:59.90]Shit, I almost blocked it.
[169:12.35]Shit!
[169:15.16]No!
[169:16.52]Good, good, good, good.
[169:18.88]Alright.
[169:21.96]Okay, I need to figure out how to play the game.
[169:31.04]I gotta figure out how to play better.
[169:32.42]Alright.
[169:39.33]Time to play.
[169:46.85]Combo trials.
[169:48.37]Here we go.
[169:50.79]And who do I actually want to play with?
[169:53.57]Let's see.
[169:54.01]I don't know.
[170:01.28]Maybe character guide.
[170:02.34]It's DJ.
[170:13.51]Who's DJ?
[170:13.89]How to play DJ.
[170:19.92]Okay.
[170:25.80]Alright.
[170:30.50]the rhythm of battle.
[170:34.28]Feints?
[170:36.62]Oh, that's cool.
[170:41.70]Seems fun.
[170:44.66]That's a lot of fake outs.
[170:49.45]Is that it?
[170:55.17]Okay.
[171:04.43]I'll try it.
[171:04.71]Alright.
[171:12.76]Rebeat combo.
[171:18.16]That's just X, X, X. Okay.
[171:26.31]Sure.
[171:28.13]DJ special.
[171:29.39]Forward.
[171:32.77]Is it X forward?
[171:36.52]I'm doing it, right?
[171:41.30]Oh, wow.
[171:41.92]Okay.
[171:43.76]Cool.
[171:46.90]Cool.
[171:51.80]Okay.
[172:04.83]What button is he pressing?
[172:15.05]Show inputs.
[172:21.81]Whoa.
[172:22.31]Okay.
[172:31.06]Trial display method.
[172:34.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[172:36.31]Oh, there's too many buttons.
[172:40.29]Command display.
[172:41.23]Oh, there we go.
[172:44.27]Okay.
[172:47.99]So what is it?
[172:48.47]Hold right trigger and then XX?
[172:50.63]Okay.
[172:52.73]Okay, then it's... Cool.
[172:55.45]Whoa, this... More of this.
[172:58.98]Holy shit.
[172:59.96]Okay, well, I didn't do any of that.
[173:01.72]It was cool.
[173:15.81]That's so cool.
[173:16.63]I just have to press one button.
[173:18.47]That's so fun.
[173:19.25]Okay.
[173:19.89]Cool.
[173:43.25]And then it's down.
[173:44.31]Okay.
[173:54.95]How fast do we have to do it?
[173:58.51]There it is.
[174:05.03]Okay.
[174:14.88]Nice.
[174:19.18]Alright.
[174:22.71]Intermediate.
[174:26.72]During a forward jump.
[174:31.02]Ooh.
[174:35.72]That'll catch people.
[174:41.06]Oh, there's more.
[174:43.19]Why and then why?
[174:44.53]Why?
[174:54.21]Holy shit.
[174:57.56]Okay.
[174:57.80]Well, can I give it a special cancelable move?
[174:59.82]Forward, forward.
[175:05.29]Whoa.
[175:12.13]This one's going to be hard.
[175:13.01]That's a lot of presses.
[175:27.77]Shit.
[175:31.46]Shit.
[175:35.34]Shit.
[175:39.74]Really?
[175:47.38]I can't string the bottom B together.
[176:19.09]Hmm.
[176:22.87]Hmm.
[176:25.70]Did that work?
[176:29.40]That's going to be way too hard.
[176:42.74]Oh, no, it's not.
[176:48.40]And then it's right trigger A. I keep forgetting to hold right trigger.
[177:02.16]It's actually kind of hard to do that.
[177:08.34]Holding right trigger and pressing A is kind of weird.
[177:32.11]Shit.
[177:33.71]What is it supposed to be?
[177:34.81]Let me see the move.
[177:36.87]After down B, what does it look like?
[177:38.29]Okay, you just have to do it really fast.
[177:41.05]Alright.
[177:59.19]No, I'm done.
[178:04.01]I got to sit here for like four hours to get that done.
[178:08.63]I'm going to take it to the computer.
[178:23.81]Go to the beach.
[178:36.11]Who should I go against?
[178:36.99]Stangief?
[178:37.65]There was more in the character guide?
[178:41.37]I pressed like A. I don't know.
[178:43.45]We come out together?
[178:45.29]That's funny.
[179:07.53]Alright, X, forward, down, B.
[179:40.08]Okay, I just got to learn the combos.
[179:53.15]That was close.
[180:19.13]You know, going the other direction is impossible for my brain to do in fighting games.
[180:24.61]That combo I just learned has to be from left to right.
[180:27.85]You know what I mean?
[180:36.37]It's like reading... I have to do the whole thing backwards.
[180:39.80]It's funny.
[180:47.25]God damn it.
[180:51.05]Focus on fundamentals first.
[180:53.56]That's true.
[181:11.66]I can't wait to watch people play because I like watching people play things very well and they're probably going to do very good at this game.
[181:32.88]One time I played Mortal Kombat, the newer one from like seven or eight years ago, and I sat in a call, I believe I was in a call with like Boo Stealth Ster, and just practicing Kenshi's combo over and over again for like four straight hours.
[181:53.22]And just sitting there and just trying to get it burned into muscle memory.
[182:00.83]There's something about that that's really fun.
[182:05.21]But we'll do a few more and then I'm going to call it.
[182:10.10]This is really cool though.
[182:11.10]I think it's really good.
[182:11.74]Let's go back to the hub.
[182:23.88]I did that for years because I didn't have good online.
[182:25.88]Yeah.
[182:31.89]It's fun because once you actually get a combo and you do it in a game scenario, it's like mom, get the camera.
[182:38.34]Okay, let's do matchmaking, right?
[182:48.12]How do I set it to matchmaking?
[182:49.80]X, okay.
[182:54.24]Oh, character.
[182:54.80]I need to get my character.
[182:59.53]Wait, what?
[183:13.15]Here we go.
[183:13.37]It's unranked?
[183:15.55]Alright, let me see if I can put something together here.
[183:46.94]Oh shit, that's not good.
[183:51.74]I'm already out of juice.
[184:09.81]Damn it.
[184:13.35]Just lost the CPU.
[184:27.46]Yeah, I get it, but I don't get it
[185:00.54]You got to get your hands to agree with your brain.
[185:02.93]Yeah.
[185:10.07]How are you guys liking it, though?
[185:11.01]How are you guys actually liking the game for Street Fighter seasoned veterans?
[185:16.68]Is it good?
[185:17.10]Do you think it's a good one?
[185:19.36]It feels like it's fun to play.
[185:25.22]It's hard, but honestly, I like it.
[185:32.02]Oh my goodness, he's just destroying me.
[185:35.38]Oh, I said a fake-out!
[185:43.19]Shit.
[185:43.51]Uh-oh.
[185:56.77]No, I can't lose to the CPU!
[185:58.03]Uhhh!
[186:05.32]I was looking at chat.
[186:58.86]It's fun.
[187:00.29]It's really fun.
[187:02.49]Maybe I'll learn it.
[187:03.85]Maybe I'll just sit on the couch and learn some combos.
[187:06.83]You know what I mean?
[187:07.65]I don't know.
[187:10.92]It's definitely really fun to play, right?
[187:14.50]I like the modern control scheme.
[187:16.57]I think it's a good addition to the game.
[187:50.72]Just learn easy combos and do those.
[187:52.08]You don't need to do big combos yet.
[187:54.22]That's true.
[187:55.28]That's very true.
[187:59.02]Just do... Do whatever you like doing.
[188:02.62]Just never tell yourself that you have some artificial limit on your skill.
[188:05.22]You can be as good as you want to be.
[188:08.14]Oh my god.
[188:10.56]The Street Fighter community is so nice.
[188:15.57]Are you serious?
[188:20.15]wow you guys are great look at look at you guys telling me that I could learn combos and I'm doing good and doing better holy smokes wow alright thank you you guys are great alright one real ranked match now
[189:01.29]Vibes are immaculate.
[189:04.04]Oh, we're going to face a good DJ.
[189:06.58]I'm kind of concerned.
[189:13.19]So this is really nice.
[189:18.21]This is cool.
[189:19.75]Alright, let's go.
[189:26.57]Ooh, I got punished really bad.
[189:29.17]Oh my god, I'm already empty.
[189:31.77]Oh my goodness, I'm already empty.
[189:52.35]That was a lot of early damage.
[189:59.35]Ooh, what the fuck did we both just do?
[190:16.68]Get out of the corner.
[190:18.34]Uh-oh, not good.
[190:50.41]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[190:58.10]Oh, that's rad.
[190:59.32]He got me right in the corner.
[191:00.52]Shit.
[191:04.50]I was too scared.
[191:24.55]Oh shit.
[191:43.82]Oh my God, how many times is he gonna do that move in a row?
[191:58.16]He had so he had so much drive.
[192:03.64]He almost got me with the drive.
[192:04.82]Let's do it again.
[192:05.38]Shit.
[192:35.87]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[192:46.74]Ouch.
[192:52.82]Oh shit, now you're in trouble.
[193:01.67]Oh my god, I'm just doing the thing!
[193:02.93]What am I doing?
[193:04.50]I'm throwing so hard!
[193:15.72]I just kicked in the wrong direction like three times.
[193:22.57]That was close.
[193:33.74]What happened?
[193:52.70]Oh, this is bad news.
[193:53.99]Oh, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake.
[194:19.98]Oh, no, there's one more.
[194:38.79]Oh, come on.
[194:55.36]Oh, that's bad.
[194:56.52]That's alright.
[195:09.95]Shit!
[195:10.29]I forgot how to do the fucking super.
[195:15.18]I was hitting back YB instead of forward YB.
[195:22.06]One more.
[195:29.08]Oh.
[195:32.00]You never even learned what the supers were for this character.
[195:34.19]That's true.
[195:36.55]That's true.
[195:40.43]How do you do them?
[195:47.74]Forward YB is one.
[195:49.70]Down YB is two.
[195:50.74]I wonder if it's a projectile.
[195:56.42]Okay.
[195:58.08]Is it the same for everybody?
[195:59.22]Really?
[195:59.46]Mm-hmm.

[197:44.36]Oh, I just got fucking destroyed.
[197:51.93]Alright, let's go.

[199:59.03]Oh, I got it.
[200:01.33]Alright, now he's going to do his like right now.
[200:08.56]I'm going to be a coward.

[201:43.24]I just panicked five times in a row.
[201:44.84]I had no idea what the fuck I was doing.
[201:54.08]I got the comeback you got in your head.
[201:55.76]You know what I need to stop doing?
[201:58.92]I have to stop pressing left bumper as if it's punch.
[202:03.64]I keep doing it.
[202:04.40]I'm like, oh, left bumper.
[202:05.43]Yeah, that's a big punch.
[202:09.13]Counters.
[202:10.55]Don't use it as offense.
[202:19.77]Go for grabs too.

[203:58.52]I saw him do like down, down, down, down, down.
[204:13.99]This is fun.
[204:14.69]I just got to learn.
[204:18.11]I just have to learn and I'll be good.
[204:27.61]Good.

[206:58.71]I parried it, what?
[207:17.45]That's a lot of X's.
[207:26.62]I gotta be more aggressive.
[208:00.98]Shit!
[208:03.73]Shit!
[208:04.79]Shit!
[208:08.19]No!
[208:08.77]Again!
[208:09.19]Oh, I can't finish the job!
[208:37.81]Oh, that move.
[208:39.61]How do I get away from that move?
[208:43.74]Did she just take my super away?
[208:45.08]I'm gonna lose.
[209:00.91]What is she doing to me?
[209:02.89]She's taking all my shit.
[209:07.09]What the fuck?!
[209:12.02]You're just panicking?
[209:12.84]This game's too hard.
[209:20.51]Throw fireballs?
[209:21.33]How do you throw a fireball?
[209:38.63]back why also can somebody help me I feel like I'm always at like zero drive even if I don't use the meter even if I don't use the bars am I doing something wrong
[210:20.44]What?
[210:20.68]Oh, okay.
[210:38.61]Jesus.
[210:41.52]The EX moves burn drive?
[210:44.40]Those are happening automatically though, aren't they?
[210:46.08]Because of the modern combat system.
[210:54.96]Okay
[211:28.02]That's the drawback of using Modern, less control with the beaters.
[211:30.49]Hmm, that's good to know.
[211:31.47]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[211:43.14]What?
[212:11.41]I couldn't do my three super.
[212:13.75]I did down and YB.
[212:14.73]I didn't do anything.
[212:16.01]What the hell?
[212:19.16]I was hitting down YB, down YB, down YB.
[212:22.90]I just want to learn how to play on classic.
[212:28.05]Oh, I had one meter.
[212:29.37]I'm an idiot.
[212:29.89]I'm looking at the bottom left.
[213:09.55]shit try to mix it up yeah alright here we go oh they didn't do anything
[213:45.33]No, he wants to E haunt me right now.
[213:48.17]I know what you're going to do.
[213:49.29]I know what you have.
[213:50.09]You have your triple combo thing.
[213:52.87]I ain't fucking around.
[213:58.79]He wants to do it so bad.
[213:59.93]I know he does.
[214:00.51]No.
[214:10.26]No.
[214:12.80]That's alright.
[214:15.27]Alright, one more and I'm done.
[214:23.12]Last one, last one, last one, last one, one more.
[214:29.12]Last one.
[214:34.62]You're being more patient.
[214:38.06]Yeah, in fighting games, I just get in my own head and I go just press every button even if you don't need to and just run and jump five times in a row.
[214:50.61]Okay, new character I haven't seen before.
[214:53.81]Oh, cool.
[215:24.17]OK, alright, alright.
[215:34.25]Alright, good.
[215:55.30]Still, I could have lost it there.
[215:57.62]Does that drink do something?
[215:59.12]It's not just a taunt.
[216:53.31]Come on, break out of it with your thing!
[216:54.79]Give me your thing!
[216:55.59]Oh my goodness.
[217:09.33]He gets new special moves.
[217:26.23]Oh boy, that's not good.
[218:00.73]Stop her line on the auto combos.
[218:03.39]Yeah, well, now that I know that it's using meter, it's using bars, I'm trying not to use it that frequently.
[218:34.19]Oh, that was weird.
[218:39.85]Oh, not good.
[218:59.21]Use R-T-Y more?
[219:02.73]Oh, you're using R-T-Y too much.
[219:04.57]Okay.
[219:06.88]Ooh, who did it?
[219:14.82]Aww.
[219:29.19]Alright, you got your three.
[219:30.21]I'm terrified of you.
[219:58.81]I don't know how that fucking move works!
[220:22.72]No!
[220:23.62]He was just ducking.
[220:37.39]Oh my god, I used it all.
[220:39.51]I used it all.
[220:40.79]How did I do that?
[220:42.59]I used that.
[220:43.33]I went to drain to zero.
[221:26.96]What does CA mean?
[221:43.82]Critical art.
[221:45.34]Oh, okay.
[221:47.76]That's a good game.
[221:48.33]Nice fight.
[221:52.89]It's level three, but more.
[221:53.75]So I probably would have got killed by that.
[221:55.01]Damn.
[222:03.12]Alright, actually last one.
[222:05.22]I mean it.
[222:06.72]Last one.
[222:09.75]I appreciate all the help though.
[222:11.99]I'm very new to this.
[222:13.63]It's really cool.
[222:14.89]Appreciate it.
[222:15.29]You guys have been really nice to me.
[222:19.31]I was going to look over.
[222:20.03]I was scared I was going to look over and it was like... Oh no, they hate me.
[222:26.84]Alright, rank up opportunity.
[222:31.86]Alright.
[223:15.00]Alright.
[223:17.20]I tried to be really patient.
[223:59.14]Why are you still bad at this game?
[224:06.97]This is the second time I've seen this character play.
[224:10.58]I don't even know what this guy's... I know he drinks alcohol.
[224:12.58]You know what?
[224:13.68]Time that person up for five seconds.
[225:01.48]Holy shit, he just fucking destroyed me.
[225:09.21]When somebody gets in a rhythm, it's just like, I don't even know what to do.
[225:17.05]What the fuck was that?
[225:18.31]I'm trying to throw fireballs.
[225:20.03]Why did he just do that?
[226:03.88]Really?
[226:04.16]Alright.
[226:16.31]We can do it again.
[226:27.18]Shit.
[226:29.46]I don't know what's going on with him, but he seems very angry and very drunk.
[226:55.37]There's been a lot of screaming.
[226:57.17]Sorry about that.
[226:57.76]Okay, I gotta pull together here.
[227:23.94]I did like no damage to him.
[227:32.78]Oh my god, he hurts so much.
[227:34.35]This guy's fucking crazy.
[227:57.46]Alright.
[227:59.04]Okay, that's enough.
[228:00.04]I had fun.
[228:06.11]That was fun.
[228:11.89]Alright, last one.
[228:17.93]Charlie, okay.
[228:29.07]You're gonna end on a loss?
[228:30.23]I know, that's... I gotta use this philosophy.
[228:32.85]One of my earbuds fell out.
[228:44.40]It's a disaster.
[229:29.70]I was a little scared there.
[229:57.20]Oh shit.
[230:00.42]I got caught in the corner.
[230:20.03]Alright, this last one.
[230:55.00]Shit.
[231:02.90]Shit.
[231:03.32]Okay.
[231:03.66]Well, I just got fucking annihilated.
[231:05.06]Okay.
[231:09.43]I keep forgetting you can do the grab parry.
[231:12.09]I forget it.
[231:12.49]I'm sorry.
[231:33.69]I didn't mean to even do that move.
[232:09.09]oh okay alright one more we did it was one and one it was one and one
[232:58.61]Damn it.
[232:59.69]I still got it.
[233:05.23]Everyone's either playing Diablo or this.
[233:07.76]Well, they're two new, cool, fun video games.
[233:16.36]I didn't mean to do that.
[233:17.36]Oh my god, I gotta stop doing that.
[233:19.08]I'm just, ugh, I fucked up everything.
[233:25.19]If you don't know how to do the move, don't pretend to do it and spam the move three times and then just burn all your meter.
[233:45.38]Really?
[233:45.66]I'm so screwed here.
[234:02.92]Dammit.
[234:10.39]Alright.
[234:11.61]Alright, this time don't go back wide, back wide, back wide and have no fucking squares left, you dummy.
[234:54.03]That's bad.
[234:55.27]That's game over.
[235:06.64]Should have blocked.
[235:09.18]Yeah.
[235:11.54]Alright, last one.
[235:13.34]Alright, no matter what happens, this is the last one for it's over.
[235:17.06]One more.
[235:17.32]And that's it.
[235:21.04]I should have ended when I won.
[235:29.21]Oh no, not this guy.
[235:38.06]That little head tilt at the end.
[236:00.40]Whoa.
[236:02.32]What the hell is that?
[236:03.20]That was crazy.
[236:12.74]I can't grab this guy.
[236:14.51]How close are I going to be?
[236:22.85]Shit.
[236:24.59]What the fuck?
[236:26.97]That did like 35% of my health.
[236:32.43]Is that just a regular grab?
[236:33.55]I missed it.
[237:01.02]My god Come on dude
[237:17.56]Oh my god, that sucks.
[237:19.24]It's not over yet.
[237:25.03]Oh my god.
[237:26.17]I don't know how far it went forward.
[237:28.05]I thought it went much further than that.
[237:30.69]Shit.
[237:35.14]Damn it.
[237:35.90]It's alright.
[237:48.36]Oh my god!
[238:01.38]Bad idea.
[238:04.47]I'm getting fucking dominated right now.
[238:21.05]I didn't even throw him, what?
[238:50.87]No, that's not good.
[239:01.76]Alright.
[239:11.33]This is something okay.
[239:13.35]I'm starting to understand it.
[239:15.21]He's super good at zoning though.
[239:16.37]That's the... I'm saying words.
[239:18.01]I don't know what they actually mean.
[239:19.05]I'm just saying them.
[239:32.26]Oh, I tried to catch it again.
[239:33.20]Bad idea.
[239:45.80]That was really stupid of me.
[239:48.10]That was really dumb of me.
[239:49.33]I don't know why I did that.
[240:09.55]Oh my god, he's un-fucking-bearable!
[240:13.21]He has moves that go across the screen, he's got moves that are close, he's got things that shoot from the fucking ceiling!
[240:17.79]Alright, that one doesn't count.
[240:37.75]I gotta end on a win?
[240:40.22]Alright, no matter what happens, this is the final one.
[240:42.10]I promise.
[240:42.96]I'm done.
[240:43.64]After this.
[240:47.40]Everyone's clapping.
[240:53.87]Hey, thanks.
[240:57.41]Oh, I wish you well in the world of... I wish I said Starcraft.
[241:03.47]Street Fighter.
[241:12.78]Alright, this is the one right here.
[241:13.62]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[241:14.36]I'm going to be quiet the whole time.
[241:15.20]Here we go.
[241:15.84]3, 2, 1, quiet.
[241:19.00]Alright.
[241:46.00]I just tried as hard as I could.
[241:47.86]Oh, nice.
[241:51.26]Okay.
[241:52.82]Okay.
[241:53.66]Alright.
[242:21.39]Okay, alright, alright.
[242:33.28]Okay.
[242:41.56]No!
[242:42.82]Why did that not connect?
[242:44.60]I don't understand StarCraft.
[243:12.43]Okay.
[243:51.91]Okay.
[244:02.81]Stream lagging?
[244:03.45]Oh, it shouldn't be.
[244:07.65]Nice.
[244:09.20]Okay.
[244:09.68]Alright.
[244:28.87]That was a good parry.
[244:32.64]Oh shit.
[244:35.56]I just got like perfect in the corner.
[244:45.33]Shit.
[244:45.93]Oh my God.
[244:46.63]My like face is sweating.
[244:47.75]I forgot to play the game.
[244:51.28]I'm in trouble now.
[245:09.29]Whoa, that was laggy.
[245:10.38]It's all good though.
[245:41.69]What?
[245:41.93]That gets animation canceled by every fucking move in the game!
[245:55.18]I did it.
[245:55.46]That was close.
[246:01.10]Alright, that's it.
[246:03.70]That was really fun.
[246:04.52]Street Fighter 6 is great.
[246:08.89]I could see how people could dump hundreds of hours into this game.
[246:13.90]I completely get it.
[246:16.10]That was awesome.
[246:19.30]Oh shit.
[246:23.24]I mean, we have to do it.
[246:24.66]I'm just here.
[246:25.96]Didn't mean to.
[246:28.63]I just, I tried to exit.
[246:29.73]You saw me hit the button.
[246:41.01]Sorry I turned the stream off halfway through.
[246:42.89]That was really stupid of me.
[246:46.65]It's alright though.
[246:47.21]We had fun.
[247:01.74]I never did face cam either.
[247:04.83]We'll do it next time.
[247:05.51]Alright, this is the one.
[247:07.19]Here, right here.
[247:16.55]To the soul you can.
[247:57.62]Oh!
[247:59.92]I somehow pulled that out of my ass.
[248:41.28]I can do that too!
[248:59.09]Alright, we have to do a rebound.
[249:07.05]Alright, be easy.

[250:35.22]That's I-1-1.
[250:35.64]Yeah, we gotta go for the whole thing.
[250:37.60]Gotta go for the whole thing.

[251:26.51]God damn it.
[251:27.07]I can't do anything.
[251:30.15]Oh, my God.
[251:30.77]I'm getting fucking screwed.
[251:33.39]Alright.

[253:04.80]No!
[253:07.42]Shit!
[253:10.28]I just didn't know what to do for a follow up.
[253:13.00]I just was like, what do I do?
[253:15.94]What do I do?
[253:20.71]It's like, wow, I put it all together and, oh, he's just, he's lying on his back.
[253:23.59]Okay, uh, B?
[253:25.37]Alright, last one or I'll delete my Twitch channel.
[253:32.41]This is the last one.
[253:38.60]If this series, whatever the series ends up being, I'm playing against this next person.
[253:44.84]Even if we rematch, that's fine.
[253:46.84]But that's it.
[253:47.90]I'm out.
[253:54.60]What was that?
[254:01.90]Stop saying last one.
[254:02.84]Well, I was supposed to leave.
[254:06.55]It's time for dinner.
[254:11.23]I'm only leaving because I need to eat.
[254:22.13]Showtime, baby!
[254:23.92]This wasn't a good fight.
[255:29.59]You got garlic bread down?
[255:31.31]Oh, I got garlic bread.

[256:09.16]What happens now?
[256:10.90]What just happened?
[256:14.46]I caught him right in the chin.
[256:26.91]I don't know what happened, but that was pretty crazy.
[256:28.65]Alright, cool.
[257:13.48]Hmm.
[257:17.22]Oh, what?
[257:17.72]I grabbed him.
[257:28.55]Alright.
[257:30.44]I got a lot of meter.
[257:31.02]I'm good.
[258:03.69]Alright, that's alright.
[258:04.33]That's alright.
[258:04.71]Alright, that's it.
[258:13.01]That was fun.
[258:19.41]Oh, I can see how people just delete weeks of their life to this game.
[258:24.28]I never got into... I didn't really care for them.
[258:26.84]They were always too hard.
[258:29.42]Well, not hard.

[261:15.27]Otto's doing better.
[261:15.92]If you don't know, Otto had a bladder infection.
[261:19.18]He still does.
[261:21.08]And yesterday I wanted to make sure that we monitored him.
[261:24.92]I can't even talk right now.
[261:27.16]That we monitored him.
[261:28.26]Because he had to go outside every 45 minutes or so.
[261:35.06]He's drinking a lot of water.
[261:36.32]But he's on antibiotics.
[261:38.02]Seems to be doing much better.
[261:38.84]So he's good.
[261:46.41]Yep, Wednesday is the next stream day.
[261:50.00]I might play more Street Fighter.
[261:53.34]Would you guys like it if I actually learned the game?
[261:57.08]That I actually learned how to play more?
[262:00.51]And play it some more?
[262:04.57]I had a lot of fun.
[262:09.85]Yeah.
[262:09.97]Yeah.
[262:13.79]Just jumping off like a couple.
[262:14.73]I'm going to learn some more combos.
[262:16.97]I might play with some other characters to get better.
[262:19.61]Make more creative characters, yeah.
[262:29.47]Thanks for being so I said this earlier, but.
[262:32.93]That was it was like no toxic chat members.
[262:38.79]So unbelievable.
[262:45.23]I don't think I've ever seen that before.
[262:50.03]No, there were.
[262:51.16]There were.
[262:51.52]Somebody said there were plenty.
[262:59.66]I just wasn't looking at the right time.
[263:03.45]That's funny.
[263:07.99]There really were.
[263:08.77]It's okay.
[263:10.51]It doesn't bother me.
[263:18.58]Don't feel pressured.
[263:20.80]No, I really... Look, I know what I'm capable of doing.
[263:25.13]Fighting games are usually not one of them.
[263:27.85]But... Yeah, you can call me a shitty player.
[263:32.69]That's fine.
[263:34.39]It's your opinion.
[263:35.01]You're allowed to have it.
[263:36.86]You can call me a... You can call me a modern... Modern Andy.
[263:42.48]And then say that I fucking smell and that I'm bad at this game.
[263:47.32]But if you do that,
[263:50.31]You're gonna get zapped.
[263:51.79]Just telling you.
[264:00.73]The fighting game community loves you.
[264:03.75]Really?
[264:04.01]Thanks, guys.
[264:09.91]I didn't know that.
[264:13.09]Well, you can't.
[264:13.69]That's a very big blanket statement.
[264:15.39]I'm sure there's plenty of people that don't like me.
[264:18.92]But I appreciate it nonetheless.
[264:23.26]Alright.
[264:23.66]Goodnight guys.
[264:24.00]See you later.
[264:25.34]Call your mother.
[264:25.76]Goodbye.
[264:26.90]See you Wednesday.
[264:28.75]See you later.
[264:48.51]you
