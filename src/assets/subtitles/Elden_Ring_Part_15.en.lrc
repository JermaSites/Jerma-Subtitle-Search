[00:05.18]Hey guys.
[00:06.72]Hey.
[00:06.82]What's up?
[00:08.40]How are you?
[00:09.26]Good to see you.
[00:12.84]How's everybody doing?
[00:14.34]Hopefully you're doing alright.
[00:18.61]Just sending out a tweet.
[00:19.29]Sorry I'm late.
[00:19.77]Yeah, whatever.
[00:20.29]You know what?
[00:20.57]I'm not even going to say that anymore.
[00:23.53]I'm not even going to say that anymore.
[00:25.67]Do I?
[00:25.89]Okay.
[00:26.81]If you're late every day, are you late?
[00:29.33]Or are you just a piece of shit?
[00:39.13]Oh sorry I'm late.
[00:39.83]Oh hey I'm late.
[00:40.55]Oh hey I'm late.
[00:41.23]Oh hey I'm late today.
[00:42.21]Hey sorry I'm late today.
[00:43.17]Hey I'm late.
[00:43.69]Oh hey I'm late today.
[00:45.54]At what point you're not late?
[00:47.16]You're just a dick.
[00:50.20]I'm not a dick though.
[00:55.38]For god's sake, what?
[00:59.90]No, I'd rather, look, I'm gonna take the incredible wisdom of Nintendo
[01:08.94]Somebody at Nintendo once said, I would delay the fucking game three more times if I knew it was going to be a better video game.
[01:18.05]When it released, when kids got their hands on it, right?
[01:23.47]Somebody said that at Nintendo.
[01:24.67]What's going on?
[01:25.47]Why is my voice like this?
[01:32.20]Why?
[01:33.44]Whatever.
[01:38.36]I would rather be live when I'm ready than turn the stream on and not be ready.
[01:44.14]Have a little bit of a headache.
[01:47.00]Sit there and go, oh, oh, my head.
[01:50.24]And everyone's like, oh, his head.
[01:51.36]And I'm like, oh, ow, ow, ow.
[01:52.99]For like 30 minutes.
[01:54.81]No, I'm going to stream when I'm ready.
[02:02.09]I think, you know what I noticed?
[02:06.07]Since streaming...
[02:08.36]Since going back to... When I say back, I mean since going down to like two days a week.
[02:15.51]Obviously Elden Ring was a lot different, right?
[02:17.31]Because I was streaming that a lot more.
[02:20.37]But since doing two to three days a week, like one to two days a week sometimes, right?
[02:23.80]I feel like I haven't seen you guys in a while.
[02:28.56]So I just absolutely unload on you with just weird stuff that I've like thought of in the last like five days.
[02:35.90]I think that's why the streams have gotten odder in the last, like, year.
[02:42.42]Because there's way more stuff for me to say to you than there was, you know, if I were to stream every single day, I wouldn't have had that Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru scenario, right?
[02:55.27]Maybe I would have, but it wouldn't have been as, uh, up in the front of the head.
[03:01.25]Because you lost your mind.
[03:03.00]No, I'm just messing around.
[03:04.34]You guys know that.
[03:05.02]Hi, how are you?
[03:05.68]Welcome to the stream.
[03:06.20]Today we're going to play Elden Ring.
[03:08.72]Not regular Elden Ring.
[03:11.90]We're going to do multiplayer.
[03:14.16]I'm going to start with some invasions.
[03:16.91]I'm going to pick a spot somewhere.
[03:18.73]I'm going to put a sign down.
[03:21.89]Or you'll put a sign down and we'll have a group password.
[03:25.23]We'll do some PvP.
[03:28.99]Maybe we'll do some summoning.
[03:30.45]If you're having trouble with the boss.
[03:32.59]Hey, maybe I might help you kill Godrick.
[03:35.39]That's very possible.
[03:39.61]What system?
[03:40.25]This is on PC.
[03:43.97]I'm not going to tell you anything yet because I don't want... Okay, here's why I don't want to tell everybody what the information is.
[03:51.78]I think I'd rather just slowly trickle in.
[03:54.94]Because I don't want, like, 5,000 people to all put their sign down right now in the same spot.
[04:03.43]So, just hold on.
[04:04.23]Do you have multiple characters for certain levels?
[04:11.97]No, unfortunately.
[04:13.03]I have one character that's 153.
[04:14.43]And then me, Strong, who is level 10.
[04:20.39]So.
[04:23.21]I'm going to be playing with this character.
[04:27.37]Just use a password.
[04:28.15]Levels don't matter.
[04:29.97]Oh.
[04:38.07]Well, I mean, but here's the thing.
[04:39.09]I'm not gonna do, like, just PvP only.
[04:41.49]I wanna do, like, some invasions and stuff.
[04:51.57]But that's the plan.
[04:52.25]We're just gonna play.
[04:53.23]We're just gonna hang out.
[04:54.51]Tomorrow, I'll be live tomorrow.
[04:58.66]We're not playing Elden Ring.
[05:00.56]Tomorrow we're gonna do DOS games.
[05:01.93]Gonna grab a bunch of random stuff.
[05:06.05]Play for a few hours.
[05:07.73]But that's tomorrow, this is today.
[05:16.38]If anybody has any recommendations for DOS games, please put them in the recommendation channel in the Discord.
[05:23.82]We've played a lot already.
[05:28.13]bringing this back.
[05:29.11]I used to do this... I've done this probably like five to ten times, maybe total.
[05:37.51]So we have done a lot already.
[05:40.06]It's going to be really hard for me to remember what those are, so we're going to... I will collectively have a pretty decent list tomorrow, but I might pop in to the Discord and ask a few questions.
[05:51.54]Alright, let me just tweet.
[05:53.98]I'll be right back.
[05:54.64]We'll get started.
[07:00.25]It just took me so long to do that.
[07:03.09]Yeah, I'll get around to the VTTV emotes.
[07:05.87]I know.
[07:07.21]Oh yeah, I'll get around to that.
[07:10.70]Yeah, you know what?
[07:11.70]I've been kind of... I don't know.
[07:18.42]Oh yeah, no, I'll get around to it.
[07:19.56]Yeah, me strong will take care of that.
[07:24.20]Alright, let's go.
[07:24.86]It took me so long to tweet that.
[07:26.72]Why?
[07:27.24]Why did that take so long?
[07:28.94]That should have been so quick.
[07:31.31]I just have to look at the keyboard.
[07:33.86]I actually, honest to God, I'm not kidding.
[07:37.56]I just said, alright guys, I'm going to go tweet.
[07:40.08]I'll be right back.
[07:41.36]Let's tweet.
[07:42.78]And I went like this.
[07:43.44]I was just looking at my keyboard.
[07:51.05]What the fuck happened?
[07:54.01]I was just looking.
[07:54.57]I was just like, I'm going to look at the keyboard for like 10 to 15 straight seconds.
[07:59.40]Alright.
[08:00.16]Hi.
[08:01.42]Welcome to another stream.
[08:04.26]Today, I'm going to be summoning people in PvP.
[08:07.60]This is not where I'm doing this, by the way.
[08:10.01]I'm not doing it here.
[08:12.29]I know that I'm going to look down and it's going to be like... I'm not... Don't.
[08:16.27]Stop.
[08:16.61]I'm not doing it here.
[08:17.93]See?
[08:18.53]There's already one right there.
[08:21.69]I'm not going to use the katana.
[08:23.63]Maybe I will.
[08:24.11]I don't know.
[08:24.47]You guys see me?
[08:25.77]Okay.
[08:26.13]How many rivers of bloods are we going to see in the first 30 minutes?
[08:29.60]I didn't even tell you what we were doing yet.
[08:32.58]Here's what I'm doing.
[08:35.22]I want to start.
[08:36.58]Let me get the hang of this first.
[08:37.92]Let me figure out how this works.
[08:40.55]I'm going to do some invasions.
[08:44.59]I'm going to try to invade somebody's game.
[08:47.79]Where should I do this?
[08:52.25]Rest till night at this bonfire.
[08:56.77]Is there a place that I should do this?
[08:57.87]I feel like I want to do it somewhere weird.
[09:08.22]Go to the mountaintops.
[09:11.14]Why rest till nightfall here?
[09:12.22]Is there a... Where I get invaded?
[09:18.56]At the divine bridge.
[09:22.92]This is like a perfect knot.
[09:25.76]Rest again.
[09:27.58]Rest again and walk to the shack.
[09:29.08]Hold on.
[09:29.40]I love how I'm still... I like beat the game and I kind of finished the actual kind of campaign of the game.
[09:36.73]I love how people are like, oh hey dude, rest at that bonfire, wake up, take ten steps forward, take ten steps backward, look at the ground, look at the sky, swing once, and a boss appears.
[09:46.20]I don't... What do I even doing?
[09:52.02]I was supposed to be inva- Okay, now walk to the shack.
[10:05.34]L-Bearing Hunter.
[10:08.22]What happened to his weapon?
[10:09.10]Oh.
[10:12.64]That's fucking hard.
[10:13.46]Dude, it's so cool they added like a boss bar for PvP encounters.
[10:16.84]That's so cool.
[10:17.40]That's awesome.
[10:18.86]They should have added that a long time ago.
[10:23.91]That's a cool move.
[10:25.35]Where'd you get this weapon?
[10:30.35]Also something they finally added, thank god, is being able to scale your player model and stuff.
[10:34.62]Like bigger head, bigger arms.
[10:41.11]Nice, okay.
[10:41.73]They can kill the NPCs in a bit.
[10:49.10]I don't even have two headphones in.
[10:50.44]This doesn't count.
[10:51.08]Oh, now I'm not supposed to drink.
[10:59.29]I know, whatever.
[10:59.87]Alright, stop with the fucking PvP joke and just kill this boss.
[11:03.95]This guy's easy.
[11:11.38]Get in!
[11:19.22]Stop respawning.
[11:22.42]Oh my god.
[11:23.20]Alright.
[11:23.46]This is not supposed to be a game where I play Elden Ring.
[11:26.70]I'm supposed to be PvPing.
[11:28.10]I'm stuck in the tree.
[11:33.64]Give me the...
[11:40.18]Thank you.
[12:10.11]How come you look like you're 17?
[12:12.87]Because I moisturize every day.
[12:14.93]I'm going to have youthful skin.
[12:19.96]Oh, the rest of my life.
[12:20.98]Did the internet just freeze?
[12:25.84]What was that?
[12:26.20]That was weird.
[12:29.89]I'll kill this guy.
[12:33.39]I'll kill this guy.
[12:44.28]This isn't Fortnite.
[12:48.28]Okay.
[12:49.00]Come on.
[12:49.52]Now I know what's happening.
[12:51.00]Wait.
[12:51.44]Is he gone?
[12:51.96]Why is he not here?
[12:52.52]Okay.
[12:55.90]I'm not playing Elden Ring anymore.
[12:57.70]I'm playing Elden Ring PvP.
[12:58.84]They're two separate clients.
[13:00.50]Two separate EXE files.
[13:02.23]I shouldn't even be seeing these enemies.
[13:04.49]It's ridiculous.
[13:07.53]Okay.
[13:08.13]So here's where I'm going to go.
[13:09.49]Beat him first.
[13:10.21]Fine.
[13:10.65]Alright.
[13:11.05]I'll beat him.
[13:50.93]I got it.
[13:51.33]I got it.
[13:51.57]I beat him.
[13:53.54]I was here for like four hours.
[13:55.14]I was here for like four hours.
[14:00.20]Medicine peddler's bell bearing.
[14:01.52]Alright, cool.
[14:01.90]I beat it.
[14:02.14]There we go.
[14:02.58]Alright.
[14:03.16]I'm not going to use the moon veil in PvP.
[14:05.13]I'm not going to do the thing that everybody thinks I'm going to do.
[14:08.11]Here's what I'm going to do.
[14:09.37]I'm going to use the baby rattle.
[14:13.05]It's going to be people are not used to fighting the baby rattle.
[14:17.07]Alright, so let's go.
[14:17.82]Are you ready?
[14:20.44]I'm just going to invade somebody.
[14:22.42]Just right here.
[14:24.28]Can I invade somebody here?
[14:25.14]I just want to see how this works.
[14:32.15]That's a summon set.
[14:32.85]Oh, here we go.
[14:33.49]Attempts invasion of other player's world.
[14:38.67]Ah!
[14:58.69]Phantom Bloody Finger.
[14:59.77]Okay.
[15:01.41]Now what?
[15:06.78]Alright, I gotta kill this person.
[15:17.47]How come they're not on the mini-map?
[15:21.47]Where are they?
[15:21.89]Do they have to be anywhere?
[15:32.21]Oh, they are on the mini-map.
[15:33.45]No, they're not.
[15:37.68]Wait, what?
[15:37.94]Do you see me?
[15:50.06]Is this guy AFK?
[16:01.95]He scared the shit out of this guy.
[16:04.11]Oh, fuck.
[16:04.63]I scared him.
[16:05.11]I scared the shit out of him.
[16:11.76]Never seen a baby rattle in PvP, have you?
[16:13.12]Fine, I'll do it too.
[16:27.25]Oh, two sorcerers back to back.
[16:33.27]He's being a weirdo, he's being a weirdo, he's being a weirdo.
[16:45.33]Wait.
[16:47.45]Wait, is that a good guy?
[16:49.65]Who is this?
[16:56.94]Oops.
[17:00.22]What's happening?
[17:03.28]Oh, shit.
[17:03.92]Okay, okay, okay.
[17:05.13]Is healing illegal?
[17:14.40]Uh-oh!
[17:14.82]Uh-oh!
[17:15.46]Uh-oh!
[17:28.23]Oh, he just baseball swung me to midair!
[17:34.88]How come I don't get a tag team partner?
[17:45.36]Oh, I got him!
[17:47.04]Now what?
[17:47.42]Now what?
[17:47.70]Now what do I do?
[17:48.08]Do I have to fight him too?
[17:50.28]Whoa, I did it.
[17:58.39]I kind of feel bad though.
[17:59.19]That's annoying.
[18:02.84]I kind of feel bad.
[18:03.66]Like, that person was just AFK, like, hanging out.
[18:07.88]That person probably had, what, did they lose their souls?
[18:18.69]They do?
[18:19.11]I feel, I feel kind of bad.
[18:22.31]That was fun, though.
[18:26.21]I don't know why that was fun.
[18:30.62]If they're five feet from the Grace, then it's fine.
[18:32.24]That's true.
[18:32.79]Oh, so I can do that anywhere?
[18:34.13]I've never done PvP in any of the Souls games, ever.
[18:39.97]So, I can just do that anywhere in the whole world?
[18:45.71]What's a weird place that no one would ever invade you at?
[18:52.00]Like a front door?
[18:56.00]LB on the map.
[18:59.46]What is this?
[19:05.29]What is this?
[19:08.23]Multiplayer status?
[19:09.53]This is where people are?
[19:14.15]Hot spots.
[19:15.41]Oh.
[19:21.61]Redan?
[19:25.93]Swamp?
[19:26.51]That is kind of a weird place.
[19:28.33]Or what about the... I mean, the front door actually has a lot of activity.
[19:33.25]What about, like, over here?
[19:34.62]Like, right in front of the Divine Tower of Limgrim?
[19:41.96]Fight him on the elevator.
[19:50.57]Here we go.
[19:52.73]Oh, I can't use it here.
[19:57.49]The guy was in AFK.
[19:58.32]He was waiting for me.
[19:59.16]He was?
[20:02.53]Hotspots.
[20:03.75]Why?
[20:04.27]I repeat.
[20:08.25]Well, that was kind of fun.
[20:09.17]I'll do it again.
[20:09.61]How about just move over here?
[20:11.45]Doesn't work in all areas.
[20:12.25]Okay.
[20:15.01]Use the taunter's tongue.
[20:17.83]Lunaria is full of tryhards.
[20:21.14]So is this sectioned off to kind of like skill level?
[20:25.42]Lunaria is for the tryhards.
[20:27.70]Limgrave is for the people that don't even understand the mechanics in the game.
[20:31.60]Caitlyn is for people that want the, like, kind of animated background like in Street Fighter.
[20:36.50]The capital are for people that said, look how far I've come in the game so far.
[20:41.76]And, like, I'm, like, look, I'm at the capital.
[20:43.95]I've played the game for a while.
[20:46.17]And the mountains is nobody cares because nobody plays.
[20:48.03]Nobody wants to be here, right?
[20:52.95]And look at how far I made it into the game.
[20:56.21]It's based on your level.
[20:57.31]Oh.
[20:58.86]Oh, let's just do it right here.
[20:59.56]Whatever.
[21:00.46]I have like... I got a shitload of these.
[21:02.56]Let's go.
[21:03.10]Festering Bloody Finger.
[21:04.08]Let's use it.
[21:13.67]Invasions are 1v2.
[21:14.47]Did it work?
[21:17.27]I didn't even look.
[21:20.71]Did I teleport?
[21:25.79]Cancel.
[21:26.17]Oh.
[21:28.86]That's not doing it.
[21:37.62]You can only invade people who are in co-op.
[21:39.10]You can 1v1 viewers by making a password for us.
[21:41.98]And putting down the duelist sign.
[21:43.28]What's going on here?
[21:48.56]Go do something so I can invade you.
[21:52.24]Oh, there's nobody around there.
[21:53.32]Okay.
[21:53.93]There is somebody around.
[21:54.63]They're right there.
[21:59.51]No one is here.
[22:01.27]God damn it.
[22:01.91]Alright, how about like... How about like... Yeah, people will be like right here, right?
[22:06.91]Yeah.
[22:10.21]Get a fight club going?
[22:11.57]I just turned... I just started.
[22:13.15]Relax.
[22:14.49]I'm not going to start the fight club before I even know how to play everybody.
[22:19.11]This is a good place.
[22:28.27]Ray Lucario again is good for PvP.
[22:30.55]I want to do some more invasions.
[22:31.98]Do people play this game?
[22:56.48]It's a dead game.
[23:00.60]Alright, here we go.
[23:10.48]I should dress like a weirdo, right?
[23:35.20]Alright, make him think I'm fucking lagging.
[23:46.00]What was that move?
[23:48.77]Starlight.
[23:49.79]Oh, that was a bad idea.
[23:50.51]I'm just gonna do this and freak him out.
[23:59.07]What the fuck just happened to me?
[24:02.80]Oh, what?
[24:03.28]That tracks?
[24:03.94]How much does that track?
[24:04.88]Oh my god, I'm gonna get embarrassed.
[24:11.27]I got him.
[24:16.03]Nice job, GG.
[24:19.43]What happened?
[24:27.06]I should dress up as the baby then.
[24:29.43]I would be furious right now.
[24:47.95]Why did... Alright.
[24:49.47]Why did that... Why did they die?
[24:52.07]I hit them with the swing from the baby rattle.
[24:54.52]That hits.
[24:55.28]Then the explosion hits.
[24:56.22]And then, like, a second later, he... What hurt him?
[24:58.60]That was weird.
[25:04.88]Alright, cool.
[25:05.70]I actually kind of like this.
[25:06.52]It's fun.
[25:10.53]You play the entire game without following up an L2.
[25:12.81]Baby rattle does not have an L2 follow-up.
[25:19.39]everybody to scream.
[25:20.71]No L2 follow-up, no L2 follow-up, no L2 follow-up, no R2 follow-up, no R- look.
[25:28.02]No R2 follow-up, no L2 follow-up, no R2 follow-up, no L2 follow-up.
[25:37.69]And by the way, the person that said that, you have to understand, I played the first, like, 50 hours of this game without the flask of Wondrous Physique.
[25:46.04]So, I mean, there's that.
[25:47.90]I have a tendency.
[25:52.14]How about just, like, right in front of the Earth Tree?
[25:53.33]That'd be kind of fun.
[25:55.05]Like, at the throne?
[25:55.93]Yeah.
[26:07.58]Let's do it right here.
[26:09.38]And let me change my outfit, because who cares about actually winning games?
[26:14.70]Let's make ourselves just look like scary and weird and creepy.
[26:17.54]Yeah, I'm gonna be an assassin.
[26:25.79]There we go.
[26:41.20]Big oven mitts.
[26:46.71]Mushroom legs.
[26:48.77]Oh, that's ugly.
[26:49.13]There we go.
[26:51.97]Should I just put on like a boxing glove and go punch people?
[27:01.45]I just want to walk around with two shields.
[27:10.12]That'd be fun.
[27:13.26]Alright, uh... Where's the katana?
[27:21.24]I just want it in one hand, and I want a parrying dagger in the left hand.
[27:24.72]I want people to think, like, oh, god damn it.
[27:27.46]Do I really have to fight against this fucking... This guy's just gonna try hard the whole time.
[27:34.52]Where is, uh... Where is it?
[27:42.93]Even if it doesn't work, it doesn't need to work.
[27:45.29]It just needs to look like I'm trying to do that.
[27:49.67]Yeah, like right here.
[27:50.29]Like the Miserecord here, right?
[27:55.10]Yeah.
[27:55.46]I want people to be like, oh, come on, man.
[27:56.92]Really?
[27:57.20]I'm going to start like this.
[28:01.82]They'll think you're trying to use Moonville.
[28:03.42]Alright, here we go.
[28:06.51]Can't do it here?
[28:07.27]Can't do it on the throne, huh?
[28:09.41]What about just like here?
[28:10.23]It means bedchamber.
[28:17.23]But I want to, whoever I invade right now as the I'm the Moonvale tryhard guy.
[28:22.88]I want to make, here's the ultimate, we're going to make somebody's day.
[28:26.86]Because I'm going to come in there and I'm going to make sure that I lose.
[28:31.38]So that person fucking jumps up in their chair and they're like, yes!
[28:34.42]Like noob piece of shit.
[28:37.69]See, like I beat you.
[28:38.75]I want to make sure that they think that.
[28:40.87]So let's do it.
[28:53.17]How long have you been drinking matcha for?
[28:55.87]Not that long.
[29:04.64]Don't pander to the 3v1s.
[29:08.14]Wait, there's a... What?
[29:11.02]Started fighting the boss?
[29:14.51]oh that's unfortunate that's so funny get me in there I'm gonna hopefully find somebody that's about to go in the boss door I want to stand in front of the boss door that was a waste of a finger they should return it to you that's not fair
[29:51.42]And I got a bow too, right?
[29:55.98]Oh, moon veil.
[29:57.44]Oh, God.
[29:59.82]Oh, here we go.

[30:28.59]They're in a Discord call right now.
[30:31.05]Going like, man, I... People... People just net decking.
[30:37.10]Yeah, nice net deck, kid.
[30:38.88]That's what they both are saying right now.
[30:42.80]Alright, this time I'm actually going to try it.
[30:43.88]I'm going to make somebody angry.
[30:50.74]No, they're saying, what the fuck was that?
[31:00.50]I'm going to actually try this one.
[31:01.70]I'm going to be the Moonvale guy.
[31:18.11]He's going to the boss door.
[31:21.75]Damn it!
[31:24.49]Shit!
[31:26.65]I wanted to backstab him so bad.
[31:33.48]I will go off and backstab somebody at this boss.
[31:36.00]I'm wasting fingers.
[31:37.14]Whatever, I can buy them from merchants.
[31:38.48]Who cares?
[31:40.77]Invade away from the boss?
[31:41.93]I want to go up there and I want to scare the shit out of somebody.
[31:45.69]Why would you ever get invaded here?
[31:47.65]Right?
[31:48.03]Like, dude, there's no... Like, what a shitty place to fight, first of all.
[31:51.59]People are just walking into this boss door.
[31:57.75]The Recusant Finger is infinite.
[31:59.15]Okay.
[32:00.32]I gotta get up there quick.
[32:02.85]They're going in.
[32:03.19]They're going in.
[32:03.61]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[32:07.19]Quickly!
[32:07.51]Hurry!
[32:08.65]Fuck!
[32:16.86]Do I have any... Is anything... What's really long range?
[32:19.54]A bow and arrow, right?
[32:24.03]Could I, like, shoot him with a bow?
[32:25.59]Like, could I turn instantly and shoot the bow?
[32:36.27]Just like a bow.
[32:38.48]No.
[32:42.26]Use a great bow.
[32:43.70]Can I even hold a great bow?
[32:47.92]Common Azure.
[32:49.98]Common Azure might take too long.
[32:53.80]Use Loretta's bow.
[32:56.08]Does that actually go that far?
[32:59.84]How annoying is that?
[33:00.80]I also don't want to be annoying the whole time.
[33:04.88]I want to see if this works.
[33:20.50]invasions are always annoying invading is inherently annoying am I being annoying you don't have a staff equipped oh god damn it
[34:01.77]That would be so scary.
[34:04.49]I don't think anyone expects... Yo, oh, somebody invaded.
[34:07.73]Oh, I wonder... They're probably far away.
[34:09.83]I'm just at the bottom of the stairs.
[34:10.94]Put the fucking staff on, dude.
[34:12.36]What a waste of... If this works... This is so stupid.
[34:17.78]I hate this.
[34:20.74]Okay, here we go.
[34:22.95]So just use the other finger?
[34:24.79]Is there any benefit to using this one because I have them?
[34:30.64]Is there any reason to ever use these ever?
[34:32.72]Is it the exact same thing?
[34:36.28]Use the taunter's tongue.
[34:37.48]I'm currently invading.
[34:38.42]It's the exact same.
[34:39.88]Okay.
[34:42.70]See if I can do it.
[35:03.97]What?
[35:06.47]Why am I up here?
[35:12.54]Is that the person?
[35:15.38]Oh shit, I got moved.
[35:32.77]Oh shit!
[35:39.27]Oh my god, it almost worked!
[35:44.61]What's ha- why did he fall down?
[36:13.30]What's up?
[36:51.23]Oh my goodness!
[36:57.41]Oh, I'm trying to kill him in one hit!
[37:05.32]What?
[37:07.32]That was such a good fight.
[37:10.25]What the fuck?
[37:11.79]That was such a great fight.
[37:13.05]What happened?
[37:13.53]They didn't rage quit.
[38:01.84]Like, what kind of stat combination is this?
[38:12.53]Oh, my neck.
[38:19.25]Also, I want this person to be like, I don't know what the fuck's going on with this guy, but I'm gonna, like, just pretend, like, I'm gonna walk around like my connection is bad.
[38:34.35]Wait, they're not here yet.
[38:47.90]Shit!
[38:48.22]I was trying to... I was trying to... You can jump over the railing?
[38:58.49]I think you can jump over the railing.
[39:05.70]You can jump over that railing.
[39:09.36]You know how I know that?
[39:10.20]Because I've seen speedrunners that do that.
[39:13.11]I just not... Whatever.
[39:17.71]Imagine somebody getting in there.
[39:19.05]Please invade someone else.
[39:25.94]I'm not invading the same person.
[39:27.54]Hotkey, my beloved.
[39:32.92]Hold on.
[39:35.62]Omega Lull, he thinks he can god-free skip.
[39:37.60]Nobody thought I could allo skip and I didn't in two tries.
[39:43.82]Come on.
[39:44.62]I just want to so badly just be the boss.
[39:46.24]I want to be standing there when they get there.
[39:48.08]Alright, I'm going somewhere else.
[39:49.96]I'm going somewhere else.
[39:50.52]Fine.
[39:53.69]God damn it.
[39:54.19]Alright, where's the, uh, where's the, uh, activity?
[40:01.55]Why is there a lot of activity inside of these dungeons?
[40:04.75]That's kind of weird.
[40:07.21]The top, like the mountain top?
[40:13.77]Do the main gate at Rey Lucario.
[40:20.60]Let's just try here.
[40:21.64]Whatever.
[40:25.14]I'm having fun doing invasions.
[40:29.14]Oh, fire Missoula.
[40:29.80]That's right.
[40:33.67]You should skip 48 minutes of waters.
[40:35.53]Why?
[40:38.09]I'm invading.
[40:38.79]I'm having fun.
[40:41.26]Getting invaded in the dungeon is actually pretty cool.
[40:43.00]Alright, where are you?
[40:45.44]Can I get on the horse here?
[41:12.42]See me?
[41:20.69]Not yet.
[41:20.99]I'm gonna scare the shit out of somebody.
[41:29.08]WHAT?!
[41:38.04]Why did mine go into the ground?! !
[41:41.06]What the fuck is happening with these people?
[41:44.44]Get away from me!
[41:50.56]Oh shit!
[41:57.33]Why?
[41:58.47]Why did my beam go two inches in front of me and do nothing?
[42:07.05]I did the beam and it went this far.
[42:10.28]What happened?
[42:14.84]I want to queue up against those people again.
[42:24.03]You aimed it at the ground.
[42:24.97]I was targeting somebody.
[42:27.47]You hit the rock in front of you.
[42:29.86]I didn't know that there was a madness beam.
[42:37.70]See them right there.
[42:47.62]I'm gonna pretend like I don't see him.
[43:09.09]What the fuck is he doing?
[43:21.96]Oh, you are fucked now.
[43:29.44]I'm just gonna stay next to this thing.
[43:39.82]This is so unfair.
[43:48.99]Am I hitting him?
[43:57.02]Shit.
[43:59.76]Is this cheap?
[44:07.19]Oh, he killed it!
[44:07.73]Fuck!
[44:07.95]Oh my god!
[44:13.38]Okay.
[44:14.66]I honestly didn't think he killed it.
[44:16.24]I don't know what I was doing.
[44:17.60]I don't understand what happened.
[44:24.38]I didn't think he was going to kill that thing.
[44:26.60]But then I forgot that other players probably don't think that the hand is that big of a deal.
[44:30.46]I was just watching him fight it.
[44:35.15]Alright, no more messing around.
[44:36.33]I'm not going to like, oh cutesy, I'm not going to attack you.
[44:38.85]I'm going to pretend like I have a connection problem.
[44:43.24]Oh, I have an idea.
[44:43.84]Let me invade somebody and pretend I have a connection problem and then they kill me.
[44:47.70]Great.
[44:48.42]Fucking fantastic.
[44:49.42]I'm killing this person.
[44:52.00]Here we go.
[45:12.33]I'm running another cooperator.
[45:13.67]Where are they?
[45:29.78]I'm not sensing any movement.
[45:30.84]I'm gonna get sniped.
[45:42.78]Use the compass.
[45:44.16]Oh.
[45:44.84]Right.
[45:45.04]I forgot that exists.
[45:55.15]These are sitting in a fire?
[45:56.21]Where are they?
[45:56.63]Is that them?
[46:11.42]What?
[46:14.97]That person tried to summon a friend and it didn't work.
[46:22.22]That's not them.
[46:24.08]Is that them?
[46:31.50]No.
[46:31.74]Inside the building?
[46:34.57]They're below you.
[46:51.79]How do I get over there?
[46:56.87]Oh.
[46:59.19]That's unfortunate.
[46:59.81]Do you re-invade with the finger?
[47:03.95]Alright, I'll try this one more time.
[47:09.28]And then I'm going to go somewhere else.
[47:10.84]I actually think this is really fun though.
[47:12.02]I love this.
[47:19.21]a password we will we will I just want to invade well actually does the password do invasions I thought that was just for what was that the password doesn't work for uh invasions does it
[47:47.71]Okay.
[47:48.21]Down here.
[47:49.67]Is this the same thing?
[47:50.33]Are they underneath me?
[47:51.21]Like, all the way?
[47:51.65]Or are they actually here?
[47:57.19]Why does he keep putting me up there?
[47:58.11]Yeah.
[48:02.71]No, I promise we will do... You guys can put your signs down, and I'll bring you in.
[48:07.00]Don't worry.
[48:07.32]And I want to do some cooperative stuff, too.
[48:09.44]I want to, like, have people summon me to help fight Godrick.
[48:15.50]Alright.
[48:16.10]I must be spawning above them, right?
[48:18.90]use another finger use another one and then it'll redo it jump down I'm one I'll die that's them right there
[48:52.99]Oh shit.
[48:54.19]Another person.
[48:54.89]This guy's going to die.
[49:00.25]But he doesn't know where I am though, right?
[49:09.72]This person's not paying attention.
[49:14.72]No, I don't want to shoot.
[49:15.40]You want to shoot your friend.
[49:16.24]Friend's not even fucking here.
[49:19.12]Let's go.
[49:26.85]Get in there.
[49:31.39]Overwhelm him.
[49:44.92]Gah!
[49:49.72]Is this guy even here?
[49:50.83]What is this guy doing?
[49:55.65]Is he still alive?
[49:57.35]Alright, well, you got no friends no more.
[50:02.57]What is that person doing?
[50:03.87]This guy's probably pissed.
[50:07.90]What the fuck is happening?
[50:11.42]What is... Is there... There's another person here.
[50:19.11]I'm so confused, but we're gonna go kill this guy first.
[50:25.36]Come on, give it to me!
[50:33.00]Oh, yo, yo!
[50:37.00]God damn it!
[50:56.56]God, holy, who's that?
[50:58.77]I can't tell these people apart.
[51:16.38]Who's this guy?
[51:26.85]What happened?
[51:31.08]I have no idea what's just going on.
[51:33.16]What was just going on?
[51:36.26]Another invader invaded you.
[51:41.58]What is compound invasions?
[51:48.09]So you tell me that guy.
[51:50.15]I invaded a player.
[51:52.75]That player asked two other players for help.
[51:58.80]I killed one of those helpers as an AFK.
[52:02.86]One of those helpers invaded that game and killed everybody in one swing.
[52:10.16]That invader was your teammate.
[52:11.66]Why was I dead?
[52:12.44]Well, he killed me in one hit.
[52:16.40]He invaded the host.
[52:17.30]You got a helper, but friendly fire is on.
[52:20.38]So did we win?
[52:21.00]Did we beat it?
[52:29.62]That's so funny.
[52:33.92]That was mayhem.
[52:34.76]I couldn't even tell you what was going on if I wanted to.
[52:42.08]That guy came in and just waved a magic wand and killed everybody.
[52:47.01]What the hell was that?
[52:48.93]The guy was a referee.
[52:49.99]That wasn't even a player.
[52:50.99]He just came in and like he blew a whistle and we all stopped.
[53:06.72]Wow.
[53:11.56]Oh, you told me to get that off!
[53:28.79]Oh, shit.
[53:33.35]Did that get, you know, snapped?
[53:54.21]Doesn't Thanos have, like, a big hammer?
[53:59.15]Thanos has a big hammer, doesn't he?
[54:03.19]No, he's got the twin blades.
[54:06.55]He's got the glaive, yeah, yeah.
[54:08.23]He doesn't have a spike?
[54:11.07]That's not an accurate cosplay.
[54:13.07]Thanos doesn't have a tabard.
[54:26.94]That was so funny though.
[54:28.93]I almost beat him.
[54:41.18]Dude, you know what I want to do so bad?
[54:42.32]I just want to freak somebody out like crazy.
[54:45.74]I want to just jump from here and land in front of them and die.
[54:48.56]They'd be like, where did they come from?
[54:49.72]Why did they just fall?
[54:50.76]Are they alright?
[54:56.72]Are they right there?
[55:02.66]Is that them sitting right there?
[55:10.77]That's a fall.
[55:11.37]I mean, I'm going to try.
[55:12.67]No, that's a marionette.
[55:16.11]They're at the bonfire.
[55:19.27]Damn it.
[55:19.59]Oh, well.
[55:23.17]You know what I'm saying?
[55:23.67]I just want that person to be walking around and a red invader just falls in their field of view in front of them and dies.
[55:34.40]Put the fingers in your hotbar?
[55:35.88]Yeah, I will.
[55:36.34]Okay.
[55:43.36]Same deal.
[55:43.70]They're probably all the way over here, right?
[55:46.64]I mean, it's the same guy.
[55:48.14]You don't know that.
[55:48.66]I mean, it could be, because I don't know how many people are currently in Mount Gelmir in the US matchmaking right now.
[55:55.06]Who knows?
[55:58.40]Last guy was here.
[55:59.08]Over here.
[56:15.33]Person hiding.
[56:26.72]I thought they were over here.
[56:29.36]I don't see any movement.
[56:31.99]Use the finger again.
[56:39.09]I didn't mean to do that.
[56:40.35]I'm glad that they see it though.
[56:48.26]I'm going to be careful.
[56:48.98]I'm going to end up in like an Elden Ring funny moments compilation.
[56:58.43]Let's go somewhere else.
[57:02.18]How about, like, here?
[57:04.24]Let's look at some hotspots.
[57:06.32]People fight here a lot.
[57:07.38]Alright.
[57:07.72]What about over here?
[57:10.06]This is where the tryhards are, right?
[57:11.60]Okay.
[57:18.85]Use the invisible crouch talisman?
[57:26.22]Do I have it?
[57:29.60]Seals wear it while crouching.
[57:32.58]Oh, shit.
[57:33.42]I actually do have it.
[57:34.08]Okay.
[57:34.46]Alright, let's go.
[57:38.65]I have to turn crouch on because I'm not pressing X every time.
[57:41.45]Alright, let's do it.
[57:48.89]So, I'm invisible, you say.
[57:51.33]So, when I crouch, when I get in the game, I'm invisible to people on the other team.
[58:06.95]It has to be only when you move away.
[58:08.69]You have to be at a distance.
[58:11.31]Do I have to stand completely still or can I move?
[58:22.16]You can move.
[58:26.64]This person doesn't see me?
[58:31.18]How... This is... Look at these Christmas lights.
[58:33.40]What is this?
[58:36.99]How close is too close?
[58:42.14]Can he see me now?
[58:54.00]Oh, okay.
[58:55.18]I've already scared him.
[58:55.86]Alright, we have to do a bow.
[59:08.61]Let's go!
[59:39.03]I got dabbed on.
[59:42.75]I had it too.
[59:43.89]I'm doing it again.
[59:47.92]It's the lag.
[59:48.78]It's the lag.
[59:49.40]I swung and it like went through his body and then like a second later it's like... But it was a glancing blow apparently.
[59:57.51]It was a glancing blow apparently.
[60:10.46]This thing, okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna just try to... That's BM though, isn't it?
[60:15.30]Isn't that BM?
[60:19.14]Kind of.
[60:25.73]I just invaded Randy the Witch's game.
[60:30.87]Oh my god, I'm in, I'm gonna be in trouble.
[60:41.50]Alright, they're trying to do something weird.
[60:43.76]Which is, I think they're trying to go on top of the house.
[60:50.55]I'm invisible.
[60:51.09]They don't know where I am.
[60:51.75]They're trying to do something weird.
[60:53.45]Okay, here we go.
[61:04.94]I got another... Wait, I have a friend.
[61:15.81]Alright, so this is a friend.
[61:18.69]It's time for some fucking classic PvP.
[61:22.09]Oh, you're a friend.
[61:22.91]Alright, let's go.
[61:23.33]Alright, I don't know if you're watching this stream or not.
[61:26.39]I mean, I'm not going to assume that, but I'll take, uh... I'll take Rain of the Witch.
[61:32.30]You go for Flame Zealot.
[61:35.34]You got it?
[61:36.34]Alright, let's go.
[61:36.82]Make sure you bow first.
[61:54.80]I feel like I'm at recess.
[61:57.25]FromSoftware PvP is recess.
[62:04.49]I'm not gonna... Get him!
[62:13.43]What?
[62:13.63]Why didn't I... I didn't get a backstab.
[62:14.81]Why?
[62:15.03]Not gonna expect that from me, are ya?
[62:52.78]Hey!
[62:55.84]What happened?
[63:01.24]I didn't start that, by the way.
[63:02.88]I just finished it.
[63:06.75]We did it.
[63:11.58]Oh, the host was the... Okay, I see.
[63:17.86]I didn't do that.
[63:18.56]That guy shot a bunch of mold out of his hands.
[63:21.94]And I didn't have anything to do with that.
[63:24.62]What level am I?
[63:25.24]153.
[63:25.33]I'm going to do it again.
[63:29.63]Wait, where's the pouch?
[63:34.27]Yeah, let's do this.
[63:43.29]I'm gonna, uh... Should I just break a bunch of remembrances in there?
[63:46.52]What can I do that's just weird?
[63:48.24]Put the soap on somewhere?
[63:49.28]Just to clean myself?
[64:00.12]Can I put this on?
[64:05.22]Oh, these.
[64:05.60]This is gonna be weird.
[64:06.20]Nobody does that.
[64:08.60]I'll do, like, another... Okay, I'm gonna do, like, maybe...
[64:13.76]Five or six more.
[64:17.06]And then we'll do some PvP.
[64:18.58]You can put your signs down.
[64:23.78]Use the mimic veil.
[64:25.76]Are you still red?
[64:26.38]You're still red, right?
[64:33.62]Can't really get rid of that.
[64:40.38]Oh, there they are.
[64:42.64]Did I just go invisible on their screen?
[64:43.74]Oh, my God.
[64:59.35]I was bowing.
[65:02.47]Oh, I missed.
[65:04.43]Oh.
[65:25.37]This is so stupid.
[65:38.75]This guy's like, does this dude have any other moves?
[66:10.01]Ooh! Aw!
[66:15.95]Good fight.
[66:22.95]Good fight.
[66:24.21]Those are some really cool moves.
[66:25.23]What the hell were those?
[66:27.57]Go to the main academy gate?
[66:30.29]I will.
[66:31.67]Try that now.
[66:38.19]Okay, main academy gate.
[66:41.43]Those are faith spells?
[66:42.17]Those are cool.
[66:43.57]Those seem fun.
[66:50.46]Dragon and crucible faith moves.
[66:53.99]So, okay, I see why this is a PvP zone.
[66:58.43]It's just a circle.
[67:02.95]I want some new clothes, too.
[67:04.02]Because I don't need to do the comedy thing anymore.
[67:12.24]What do I actually want to put on?
[67:17.94]I guess I could put on the hat.
[67:22.40]Kind of look like a dickhead though.
[67:23.42]Alright, um... Fine.
[67:37.67]Still medium with these big pants on.
[67:42.01]This place is for duels, not invasions.
[67:45.91]Oh, who's to say that?
[67:46.63]Who's to say I'm not?
[67:48.97]I'm doing it right now.
[67:56.32]The mimic veil actually works?
[68:00.04]Is it though?
[68:04.32]Put it on.
[68:11.94]It works.
[68:15.80]How is there nobody to invade here?
[68:17.06]Oh, there we go.
[68:22.14]Use the red sign on the ground?
[68:24.42]I will.
[68:25.90]Is cross region enabled?
[68:27.00]It is not.
[68:29.40]I'm sorry to all the people that are not in the United States, but I'm not going to get swung at, dodge, and then two and a half seconds later take damage for it.
[68:39.49]It's just not happening.
[68:49.89]Alright, well, whoa, come on.
[68:56.98]I'm 153.
[68:57.16]Alright, here we go.
[69:02.99]If you want to put a sign down, I'll put mine.
[69:06.53]The multiplayer password is cheese doctor.
[69:11.57]Just like that.
[69:11.95]I'm going to put this... I guess I'm just going to have to pull people in.
[69:27.44]It's probably easier for me to pull signs in, right?
[69:29.50]I mean, you can't see it.
[69:32.32]Alright, well... Okay, the password is Cheese Doctor.
[69:37.80]Capital C, capital D. Cheese Doctor.
[69:40.32]No spaces.
[69:43.26]No period.
[69:45.50]Cheese Doctor.
[69:48.74]E-R.
[69:56.37]Just move the face cam.
[69:57.51]Hold on.
[69:57.81]Alright.
[69:58.01]Oh my goodness.
[69:59.40]I just told you what it was.
[70:00.22]Here.
[70:06.60]Cheese doctor.
[70:10.28]See it?
[70:10.52]Alright.
[70:17.80]Here we go.
[70:25.73]It's trying to invade another world over and over again.
[70:33.67]The last time I did this in Dark Souls, it was insane how many signs were on the ground.
[70:38.04]Turn off the invasion.
[70:39.74]Use the remedy.
[70:48.78]Oh, okay.
[70:53.12]How do I turn off the invasion?
[70:59.81]What happened?
[71:01.11]I finally found somebody to invade.
[71:02.79]Why would this be out here?
[71:30.69]It's Garfield.
[71:37.95]I don't think he notices.
[71:38.67]Alright, well that was cool.
[71:41.93]No, no, no.
[71:44.93]I don't... Take it off.
[71:47.19]Put it back on.
[71:48.21]Like that's gonna fix it.
[71:49.73]How do I take this off?
[71:52.89]How do I take it off?
[72:38.11]Wait, is this too obvious?
[72:50.14]I can't see!
[72:52.40]I can't see, the painting covers it.
[73:04.61]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
[73:27.66]That's so funny.
[73:31.92]Alright, where are the signs?
[73:39.32]That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[73:41.36]I might invade your game.
[73:45.72]Terms and conditions do apply.
[73:50.64]Could you be the lucky viewer that Jerma985 invades?
[73:52.98]I think this is a weird thing.
[73:58.97]Some celebrity will do that, and they've never played.
[74:01.67]They're just part of the promotion.
[74:03.33]They just don't give a shit at all.
[74:04.91]They invade, like, two people.
[74:07.49]That's the whole thing.
[74:11.65]That's the big... Wow, I can't believe it.
[74:13.41]They play for like 8 minutes.
[74:16.75]Alright, let's do this one.
[74:21.12]Oh no, we're going against the Joker.
[74:24.28]Two huge hammers?
[74:35.16]That's not a viewer.
[74:37.96]How do you know?
[74:41.60]I want to invade somebody and like hide.
[74:43.50]I think that's so fun.
[74:54.73]You ready?
[74:55.05]I don't know why I just did what you did.
[75:02.74]This is weird.
[75:07.34]This looks like a cartoon.
[75:16.78]Whoa!
[75:30.11]Oof!
[75:39.25]I had no stamina.
[76:06.66]Didn't think it was going to be twice in a row.
[76:08.23]Oof.
[76:14.94]Good game.
[76:15.72]Good fight.
[76:21.93]That was cool.
[76:23.97]Nobody expects twice in a row.
[76:33.22]Okay.
[76:33.42]Who are you?
[76:34.84]How about Billy Bobbertson?
[76:40.43]That sounds fun.
[76:46.45]Password?
[76:46.87]The password is Cheese Doctor.
[76:48.53]Capital C and then D-R.
[76:50.85]Capital D. Cheese Doctor.
[76:52.27]This is still not a viewer.
[76:53.45]How do you know that?
[76:55.03]You don't know that.
[76:55.67]Alright, let's incorporate some more sorceries here.
[77:17.81]Dodge always... I didn't mean to do that.
[77:19.01]Alright, here we go.
[77:21.27]You can always say, I'm ready by doing the strafe, strafe, strafe, strafe.
[77:27.82]Oh, I got it off!
[77:33.60]He's panicking!
[77:49.78]Ooh, nice bait.
[77:50.62]That was good bait.
[77:51.86]It was.
[78:06.51]Whoa!
[78:07.97]Whoa!
[78:14.58]Don't waste all your stamina!
[78:19.31]Oh, got me.
[78:25.42]Signs with circles are viewers.
[78:26.92]Oh, shit.
[78:31.58]Okay.
[78:33.14]That was good.
[78:33.44]That was a good fight.
[78:40.34]So that was not somebody watching.
[78:42.04]Okay.
[78:43.73]Okay.
[78:53.91]There we are.
[78:54.51]Okay, so this person... That's not... There's no circle.
[79:01.93]Oh.
[79:02.53]Are we going to go up against Shpi?
[79:08.16]Oh, it's the circle on the bottom.
[79:09.44]I thought you meant it was going to be up here.
[79:13.90]Fine.
[79:22.83]I need some better emotes.
[79:23.76]These are like default dances in Fortnite.
[79:27.53]Get them off.
[79:52.67]Oh, it looks like I was mocking.
[79:53.64]Alright, here we go.
[79:59.32]Ready?
[79:59.56]I'm ready.
[80:13.29]Hey!
[80:14.17]That's... Excuse me.
[80:16.13]Excuse me.
[80:16.71]He's drinking flask.
[80:17.91]Where's the referee?
[80:33.11]All the rules are wrong.
[80:34.75]I'm drinking.
[80:35.65]I'm gonna drink.
[80:36.31]I'm not gonna let that happen.
[80:39.55]If you get one, I get one.
[80:50.14]Thank you.
[81:30.50]Good fight.
[81:30.90]Yeah, I ran forward.
[81:36.07]Immediate pivot.
[81:39.73]That was a good fight.
[81:45.59]That's the soul level.
[81:46.65]153.
[81:47.13]This is really fun.
[81:52.42]Like, this is really fun.
[81:53.78]I understand why people do this now.
[81:57.86]Alright, I need the ones with the circles.
[82:00.04]Here we go, right here.
[82:02.90]Zorum?
[82:07.08]We're... We'll go Zorum first.
[82:10.38]Okay, how about peeing myself?
[82:11.74]That sounds... That's good.
[82:13.09]That might not even have been a viewer.
[82:21.79]I don't think that was a viewer.
[82:31.70]What are the emos I have?
[82:32.40]We'll just do this before they hear her.
[82:36.86]Alright, what do you got?
[82:45.35]What are you wearing?
[82:47.95]I don't see any weapons.
[82:51.43]What a mistake.
[82:56.21]Right now he's like, oh shit!
[82:59.41]The forward dash, the forward dodge is just, oh my god, I'm ready.
[83:03.54]I gotta be ready.
[83:04.98]Okay, let's do it.
[83:12.70]He's metal.
[83:24.21]Fat roll?
[83:28.07]What the hell is going on?
[83:30.89]What is happening with this person?
[83:37.67]I'm so confused.
[83:44.68]Wait, what's going on?
[83:45.86]What the fuck is going on?
[83:51.68]I'm so... What happened?
[83:59.30]Oh, he's peeing.
[84:00.22]Okay.
[84:02.75]He also drank flask, too, which, uh... We all know that that's, uh, not allowed.
[84:16.31]Yeah, he, like, he was, like, teleporting.
[84:17.81]That was weird.
[84:18.27]Alright.
[84:18.95]Yeah, I do have password.
[84:19.73]Alright, password is cheesedoctor.
[84:21.71]You can't see it, but I'll move.
[84:22.69]Password's cheesedoctor.
[84:24.92]Cheesedoctor.
[84:31.14]Chug flask before a fight?
[84:33.54]Is that cheating?
[84:34.70]What should I do for a flask?
[84:48.13]Okay.
[84:49.73]Who are you?
[85:00.07]uh shyness boy sure I'm not going to use that right now wait actually tell me the truth is using the wondrous physique flask
[85:30.58]BM in PvP or no, is that fine?
[85:36.58]No, okay.
[85:38.02]I don't know where this person is, but they're not here.
[85:49.23]I think this is fucked up.
[85:53.35]Okay.
[86:00.06]What about over here?
[86:01.04]Alright, this is... Dirtquake.
[86:19.55]Is there Xbox... That's an Xbox username?
[86:23.64]What does this say?
[86:24.66]No skill ahead.
[86:25.44]All the more dung ahead.
[86:28.82]Try summoning.
[86:31.03]Oh for Rennala?
[86:35.84]How are we?
[86:41.47]Here we go.
[86:52.05]What the fuck?
[86:52.99]What happened?
[86:54.53]That actually worked?
[87:07.49]Alright, that was... I'm not using that again.
[87:12.61]That was kind of unfair.
[87:19.11]I'm sorry, Girthquake.
[87:20.29]That was not fair.
[87:21.60]That was just stupid.
[87:26.32]That's... That's so dumb.
[87:32.06]Uh, how about... Hilarious.
[87:33.88]I want to see if I can get one of these off in the beginning.
[87:43.71]Like, right when it's like... Let's go, let's go, let's go, right?
[87:46.43]Okay.
[87:49.64]That worked shockingly well.
[87:53.06]Is that fire damage?
[87:55.84]So technically you could put on a ton of fire resist, drink that, blow up, and then fight.
[88:00.93]Totally, really, that's weird.
[88:04.63]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[88:05.55]Alright, okay, we're just going.
[88:07.35]We just got here.
[88:10.21]Scared the shit out of me.
[88:10.99]I thought that was the magic bullet doing that.
[88:32.72]Oh.
[88:41.72]Wowee.
[88:43.88]Oh, I wanted to jump but I didn't have enough stamina.
[88:47.48]Nice fight.
[88:53.12]You're allowed to use a blue flask?
[88:54.56]You are?
[88:57.56]I can drink?
[88:58.72]Blue?
[89:02.91]Okay, cool.
[89:06.81]So blue is allowed, okay.
[89:10.71]This is fun.
[89:16.26]Pick me, pick me, please.
[89:24.55]Warrior Millenia.
[89:35.32]I'm sorry, but there's no respect here at all.
[89:38.84]This is absolute... I'm just going to go straight up disrespect.
[89:41.50]If this is you playing right now, just be aware.
[89:43.82]I'm going full on disrespect mode.
[89:45.58]Full disrespect.
[89:49.80]You don't come in here with a Millenia cosplay on.
[89:57.98]What the hell?
[90:18.39]You wanna play that?
[90:19.30]Alright, we'll play that.
[90:30.05]NO!
[90:30.43]NOT THAT STUPID THING!
[90:37.43]You gotta be fucking kidding me!
[90:39.27]She has this move, where she goes in the air, and she- You cannot fucking avoid the-
[90:53.44]Yeah, well, maybe if I didn't drink the... take two-thirds of my health off in the very beginning by drinking the exploding flask and I didn't time it right.
[91:00.79]Hold on.
[91:11.85]Are we certain that the summoning signs are... Is that accurate?
[91:15.49]The circle on the ground?
[91:18.23]How actually accurate is that?
[91:20.81]Don't growl at me, okay?
[91:30.49]So you can drink these.
[91:31.31]That's cool.
[91:31.83]Alright.
[91:32.73]Maybe I'll even change up my spells too.
[91:34.93]These are PvE spells.
[91:35.97]I think I'm going to change that up.
[91:38.36]I'm going to put on this weird shit that people are going to be annoyed to have to deal with.
[91:44.66]PvE?
[91:45.48]Okay, yeah.
[91:45.94]Like shooting glintstone ice crag.
[91:47.88]No, it's not going to work in PvP.
[92:01.80]Let's do it.
[92:21.87]Oh, you can... Okay, you poised through that.
[92:40.96]Oh, fuck!
[92:46.91]Okay.
[92:47.21]He poises through it.
[92:47.89]He poises through it.
[92:49.35]He poises through it.
[92:51.23]Okay, for some reason, I thought that the magic glintstone ice crag was gonna break that poise, but you just said you cannot become out of that animation.
[93:03.46]I didn't know.
[93:04.00]I didn't know.
[93:04.74]I didn't know.
[93:05.28]And if I knew you would have lost, by the way.
[93:06.76]If I knew you would have lost that fight.
[93:11.24]Yeah.
[93:13.33]Yeah.
[93:17.85]Okay.
[93:18.27]This is not going to work.
[93:19.45]But maybe this will.
[93:21.81]Yeah.
[93:22.35]Let's do that.
[93:24.97]That's alright.
[93:25.49]Hold on.
[93:26.41]What about... I thought that was weird.
[93:29.95]Like freezing mist.
[93:31.21]Like who the fuck uses this?
[93:35.58]Meteorite, something weird.
[93:38.88]And what else should I do?
[93:47.01]Crystal release.
[93:52.89]Demo or Ice Storm.
[93:53.56]Alright, let's just be kind of like an annoying weirdo.
[94:06.36]Alright, Zoram, let's go.
[94:09.56]Crystal Burst is good.
[94:14.31]Oh, wait, I don't want to do that.
[94:15.21]That's kind of, like, bad, because it'll start attacking him, and I don't want to start attacking him before he... That's, like, kind of unfair.
[94:19.79]Alright, here we go.
[94:26.71]You're missing half of the PvP spells.
[94:28.73]Ah, I don't... Whatever.
[94:33.71]These aren't just going to shoot over there, right?
[94:43.20]Okay.
[94:46.48]Get out of the emote.
[94:49.24]Oh, shit!
[94:51.04]Alright, you can... You can drink.
[94:52.94]You can drink.
[94:53.32]That wasn't fair.
[94:53.92]That wasn't fair.
[94:54.54]You can drink.
[94:55.38]That wasn't fair.
[94:57.18]That wasn't fair.
[94:57.72]You can drink.
[94:58.80]Okay.
[94:58.98]Alright.
[95:00.30]Here we go.
[95:00.80]Ready?
[95:01.00]Okay.
[95:10.09]Freezing mist is weird.
[95:11.15]Nobody expects it.
[95:20.37]Holy shit!
[95:41.56]I'm alive!
[95:42.00]I'm still alive!
[95:42.56]I'm still alive!
[95:43.56]I'm still alive!
[95:48.35]Kill him!
[95:48.77]Kill him!
[95:50.83]That was a 99... 99 int play right there.
[96:09.69]Should I just go put 99 points in int?
[96:14.09]Okay, no.
[96:15.05]Zero points.
[96:16.85]Zero points in anything else besides mind and int.
[96:21.19]And just hold down that spell.
[96:23.95]That's so dumb.
[96:24.66]Alright, maybe I want to play normally a little bit longer.
[96:27.74]Okay, trans rights.
[96:38.40]Let's go for it.
[96:42.64]Get the crystal tier that makes spells cost nothing.
[96:46.88]Oh, I do- Wait, wait, wait.
[96:47.98]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[96:56.01]You coming?
[96:59.07]He's fi- Yeah.
[97:03.37]Zero cost.
[97:04.27]Oh, I don't have to do mine.
[97:05.01]You're right.
[97:05.37]Okay.
[97:07.49]Here we go.
[97:10.47]You ready?
[97:16.60]Oh!
[97:19.14]You're not gonna expect this right now.
[97:27.90]That's the first parry that we have seen all afternoon.
[97:54.77]Flail?
[97:55.39]Wait, you can't parry a flail.
[97:57.93]That's right, you can't parry a flail.
[98:00.44]It's good for PvP.
[98:13.03]Alright, alright, let's go!
[98:13.97]Poth?
[98:21.80]What's the swear?
[98:22.50]Poth?
[98:26.02]Pothead.
[98:30.99]What is it?
[98:32.05]Head?
[98:34.01]Your name can't be Head?
[98:35.31]Head?
[98:46.09]Uh, group password is CheeseDoctor, capital C, lowercase h-e-e-s-e, capital D, lowercase r, and that's it.
[98:56.26]Why are you like five times bigger than everybody else?
[98:58.12]This guy's huge.
[99:03.92]Am I crazy?
[99:10.27]What the hell?
[99:10.95]Why did I come up before he threw it?
[99:13.91]This is a cool character though, can I be honest?
[99:17.89]You only have a certain amount of those.
[99:19.15]Holy shit, what?!
[99:29.37]Ooooooh, good game.
[99:41.00]That's a cool character.
[99:45.03]Just throwing pots?
[99:49.64]I like that.
[99:50.56]That's fun.
[99:54.50]That was good.
[99:56.54]How do you catch people off guard with that, though?
[100:00.05]Because if you come in, if you have the jar, if you have that jar on your head, right?
[100:05.99]I'm gonna know.
[100:10.47]Alright, galaxy.
[100:11.18]Let's go.
[100:17.45]I will do the... just put... I need... okay, where do I get some of the PvP spells?
[100:29.65]Use the cannon?
[100:34.10]It's the EAD which qualifies as a swear because it's an acronym for eat a dick.
[100:44.24]Really?
[100:47.33]Eat, eat, eat.
[100:48.73]Oh my god.
[100:49.45]Alright, let's go.
[100:57.38]That was weird, but I got you.
[100:58.92]You're not going to fuck with the guy in Zobar's Ice Storm, are you?
[101:24.09]Telling you, nobody expects you to do that two times in a row.
[101:47.13]Whoa!
[101:47.45]What was that?
[101:49.09]He's got knives?
[101:51.15]Oh, that's right.
[101:51.95]Consumables exist.
[101:58.18]Fuck.
[101:59.98]That was a good idea.
[102:07.52]Throwing daggers.
[102:13.47]Yeah, everybody does the Thanos snap.
[102:16.19]I should do it too then, right?
[102:17.23]I gotta do the meadow.
[102:19.67]How come I can't throw these?
[102:20.49]Because you could really, okay, you could freak somebody out, right?
[102:29.62]If I, like, do a soap.
[102:33.18]Hey, what about this weird shit?
[102:35.84]Gravitational shockwave?
[102:37.14]Like, who's ready for that?
[102:48.87]We already saw you.
[102:49.65]Uh, Rock Strongo.
[102:52.67]Okay.
[102:56.01]You think I'm doing something, but it's like, wait, he just did soap.
[103:03.63]You gotta freak the gamers out with soap.
[103:09.63]Level 153.
[103:18.18]Earthquake was the guy that you cheesed.
[103:21.30]I didn't cheese anybody.
[103:26.93]How are you?
[103:27.95]Welcome to the fight.
[103:29.97]Let's begin.
[104:00.52]Ooh, that's not good!
[104:05.64]Good fight.
[104:07.76]Caught you right at the little tail end of that.
[104:15.19]That was very close to you not getting in the hitbox.
[104:19.15]Could have been lag.
[104:26.89]Could have been lag.
[104:31.91]Your password and the level on the screen so people don't ask anymore.
[104:34.34]That's a good idea.
[104:35.78]Let me do that real quick.
[104:42.53]OK.
[104:43.81]Password is.
[104:44.93]Uh.
[104:47.85]OK, and.
[104:51.18]It's all level 153.
[104:53.46]There we go.
[105:01.95]You're beautiful.
[105:04.11]Thanks.
[105:04.37]Look at this go.
[105:12.46]Is that alright?
[105:15.00]That's okay, right?
[105:18.10]Alright.
[105:20.52]Oh shit, we're playing.
[105:21.46]Okay, here we go.
[105:31.85]What was that?
[105:40.71]Ooh!
[105:55.95]Good fight.
[105:57.25]We both had the exact same idea.
[106:05.13]Oh, platform.
[106:06.17]PC.
[106:07.24]Do you want to put my PC specs in there too?
[106:11.53]Hold on.
[106:43.21]There, that's better.
[106:45.23]That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.
[106:50.79]That's fine!
[106:51.31]Okay, that's fine.
[106:58.15]Interesting.
[106:58.85]Okay, you got those horns.
[107:02.77]I wonder if you're also gonna have the, um... That move.
[107:09.83]The weird one.
[107:13.95]It's not aligned with the ruins bar.
[107:15.25]I actually was thinking that somebody was going to be very, very upset about that.
[107:18.82]Right?
[107:19.42]Property of Jerma984.
[107:20.76]Yeah, like a watermark.
[107:25.76]Imagine watermarking your stream like that.
[107:27.72]Like, I mean, huge.
[107:29.26]Like, across the whole thing.
[107:31.52]I'm going to do that in a minute.
[107:33.01]Not right now.
[107:35.17]Hello!
[107:39.73]I want to just bow.
[107:40.49]That's not bow.
[107:41.11]Bow.
[107:44.09]I got a big sword, alright.
[107:59.68]Oh shit!
[108:02.70]Oh shit, you do have that thing, okay.
[108:08.29]Oh, no one's ever ready for it, but...
[108:23.28]That was the unfortunate triple tap.
[108:26.68]That was a triple tap.
[108:27.44]That was unfortunate.
[108:28.20]The game.
[108:33.11]I like that build.
[108:33.73]The build's cool.
[108:38.19]Add using Xbox controller.
[108:47.51]Okay, Jermaboy.
[108:51.29]Jermaboy.
[108:51.89]Alright, what's the over-under that this guy walks off of the balcony and dies?
[108:59.52]Quick, before they come in.
[109:00.32]It's pretty high.
[109:23.17]What are you doing?
[109:27.15]You can hear us.
[109:30.16]Right now, going through this viewer's mind is fuck.
[109:35.89]I want to fight the streamer because I want to kick his ass on stream and embarrass him in front of an audience.
[109:41.55]But also, I want to jump off to make the joke happen, right?
[109:47.81]Holy shit.
[109:48.69]Alright.
[110:14.01]Jump off the balcony, you can do both.
[110:19.99]That was insane.
[110:20.69]That was actually a boss fight.
[110:26.68]Double whip?
[110:37.12]Humiliated, he pointed down.
[110:44.76]Oh, I want to try that.
[110:45.38]Alright.
[110:54.89]Um, mug, mug mania.
[110:58.61]Mug maniac.
[110:59.31]Go to the coliseum.
[111:10.73]I want to go back to... Invasions were fun, too.
[111:12.90]We'll jump around.
[111:14.24]We'll do this for another 10 to 15 minutes, and then I want to do some more invasions, because that was really fun.
[111:20.60]I'm going to go change the character to be annoying.
[111:23.42]Okay, Mug Maniac.
[111:28.35]Hey, how are you?
[111:30.53]Good to go?
[111:30.87]Good to go.
[111:33.59]Okay.
[111:45.41]Thank you.
[112:13.46]Ooh!
[112:13.92]I tried to bait him.
[112:14.64]Good game.
[112:17.32]I was hoping that I was gonna run and then he was gonna turn and run and I was gonna jump and get him.
[112:23.20]Again.
[112:33.70]Don't ask for the password anymore.
[112:35.04]Is that too... Is that too hard to see?
[112:51.41]Killer Andy.
[112:55.48]Got an interesting costume on.
[112:56.92]Killer Andy.
[112:57.62]Here comes an average Jerma viewer.
[113:20.44]Well, I mean, there's a lot of Jerma viewers in this spot right now because we're doing this right now.
[113:28.01]Alright, let me get a look at you.
[113:31.21]Okay, devil horns.
[113:32.83]Is that a katana?
[113:35.24]What is that, moon veil?
[113:36.14]I'm not sure.
[113:37.54]Let's go.
[113:44.75]Wait, you can... What happened?
[113:48.57]What happened?
[113:50.41]What just happened?
[113:54.41]What?
[113:58.22]I don't understand.
[114:01.22]He parried you?
[114:02.32]I got parried?
[114:05.60]He did the insta-kill exploit.
[114:11.28]Oh.
[114:12.27]Oh.
[114:19.44]Okay.
[114:24.34]You know what the best part about that was?
[114:26.69]After it happened, he stood completely fucking still like this.
[114:34.91]No moving, no taunting, just still.
[114:37.57]Completely still.
[114:39.55]You would think that, oh, you'd come up and point at the ground and be like, hey!
[114:44.66]No, he was over here.
[114:45.56]He was just doing this.
[114:48.94]He's so menacing.
[114:50.30]And strange.
[114:54.08]I can see his... Yeah, I can see him breathing.
[114:58.18]Okay.
[115:07.46]Alright, we already fought you.
[115:10.23]We already fought Jermaboy.
[115:11.41]Alright, let me reload the area.
[115:19.54]Actually, maybe we should go somewhere else.
[115:23.08]Any new signs here?
[115:26.14]I guess we just fight... Let's fight Boar.
[115:28.26]Turn on cross region.
[115:34.03]I'm sorry.
[115:36.57]I'm sorry.
[115:37.11]I don't want to lag and then I don't want to die to lag and then blame you.
[115:48.90]I gotta pee.
[115:51.07]Okay, after this one, I'm going to pee, refill my drink, come back, and I want to do some more invasions.
[115:56.69]Here we go.
[116:27.11]I don't think people are ready for this move.
[116:32.12]I don't think people are ready for it.
[116:33.14]You just don't see it that often?
[116:41.91]One more, one more.
[116:42.47]That was a good game.
[116:43.11]Good game.
[116:44.51]I thought I was dead in that first one second.
[116:46.13]When I missed and he went, ba-ba-ba-boom.
[116:48.14]I was like, oh, it's over.
[116:49.04]Good fight.
[116:52.34]Oh, this is high, Jerma.
[116:54.04]Are you different?
[116:55.18]Different name?
[117:00.52]You should do a few cross-region.
[117:02.20]Alright, I promise that before I turn the stream off, I will do at least five to ten cross-region matchmaking games.
[117:09.01]Promise.
[117:20.40]Alright.
[117:21.16]How you doing?
[117:21.52]I don't know what that is, but it looks interesting.
[117:59.73]Did I just duck it?
[118:05.29]Oh, I got it.
[118:07.97]Good game.
[118:16.04]I think I actually ducked under that.
[118:17.24]That was weird.
[118:22.31]That was the moonlit sword, was it?
[118:23.41]Yeah.
[118:25.25]Alright, let me take a quick break.
[118:28.03]I'm going to pee, I'm going to refill my drink, and I'm going to do some more invasions when I come back.
[118:31.76]See you guys in a minute.
[118:33.96]My camera's getting dark too, hold on.
[118:35.08]I'll be right back.
[123:45.97]Okay.
[125:18.23]Dude, where the fuck is he?
[125:20.95]This fucking kid, I swear to God.
[125:24.85]This fucking guy goes fucking BRB and doesn't fucking come back for like 10 minutes.
[125:31.23]Fucking thing.
[125:36.34]British what?
[125:38.40]That's not British.
[125:39.64]British Jerma?
[125:40.56]Okay.
[125:48.81]Was that British?
[125:49.65]That's weird.
[125:50.25]Okay, here we go.
[125:52.17]Put the watermark on.
[125:53.11]We will eventually.
[125:57.52]Cannot hear the game at all.
[126:00.04]I cannot.
[126:02.31]Alright, two more.
[126:05.69]Okay, three more PVPs.
[126:08.19]And then I want to do some invasions for like a half hour.
[126:12.00]And then I want people to summon me to help me beat the boss that you're having the most trouble with.
[126:16.76]Whatever boss you're having a lot of trouble with, you get me in there and let me help you out here.
[126:29.60]Better.
[126:30.62]Cool.
[126:31.24]So, uh... Add an opportunity here.
[126:34.72]Is there any new signs?
[126:36.70]Okay.
[126:37.20]Zach of Lothric.
[126:40.12]Sure.
[126:40.34]Let's do it.
[126:42.64]Malenia?
[126:51.51]Okay.
[126:51.87]If you... If you summon at least three people, I will be in that fight with Malenia.
[126:56.39]Okay.
[127:03.88]Can you help me with the Tibia Mariner?
[127:06.08]Don't summon me for the Tibia Mariner, but yes.
[127:11.61]Hello.
[127:15.39]Here we go.
[127:16.59]Sounds fun to me.
[127:17.39]Holy shit.
[127:26.68]What the fuck?
[127:27.20]Why did I not do my move?
[127:36.40]Oh shit!
[127:39.60]I didn't want to get flawlessed.
[127:41.64]Okay.
[127:46.86]You are bad.
[127:47.70]What is your name?
[127:53.39]Jerma Enjoyer with like a bunch of zeros.
[127:57.65]What is that name?
[128:07.86]This is an average Jerma fan.
[128:10.96]No.
[128:11.79]Don't say that.
[128:12.75]We have to... Alright, two more, two more, two more, two more, two more.
[128:17.55]I promise, two more.
[128:22.86]Grandpa Supreme.
[128:25.46]Oh, this is a Morgott cosplay.
[128:44.79]Remember, my internet isn't working.
[128:46.29]I can't help.
[128:48.85]Well, the internet has... Internet's a weird place.
[128:51.43]It has a bunch of problems.
[128:52.27]Sometimes the internet just doesn't work.
[128:54.32]Hey, Grandpa, how are you?
[128:55.84]Let's do it.
[128:56.16]Oh!
[129:21.33]Good fight.
[129:31.33]What was that move?
[129:32.03]That fire move was cool.
[129:42.84]Is it still?
[129:43.54]Okay, we're good.
[129:43.88]Alright, last one and then I'm going to do some invasions.
[129:47.24]I'm going to pick some cool places.
[129:50.92]Remember, my sign isn't showing.
[129:52.20]Well, we're gonna do this again.
[129:53.02]Alright, we fought Yzorum already.
[129:56.20]Doesn't mean we can't fight people more than once.
[130:03.38]Or... The fist.
[130:07.13]Sure.
[130:09.95]Do co-op invasions with the taunter finger.
[130:13.03]Yeah, I'm... Let's do it all.
[130:15.57]I mean, I'm here for a while.
[130:16.91]I'll be here for at least, like, another three or four hours.
[130:21.74]I want to get a good multiplayer experience today.
[130:24.00]I don't just want to do PvP for six hours.
[130:31.56]Right?
[130:31.78]I want to do invasions.
[130:32.62]I want to do summoning.
[130:33.43]I want to do health.
[130:34.17]I want to be double invasion.
[130:35.75]I want to get invaded.
[130:40.85]Ah!
[130:52.23]What is going on?
[130:56.79]Was that- was I bad?
[131:00.31]I mean, I- I was just R1-ing, right?
[131:04.12]Like, that's- I was- I was hitting R1, R1, R1, R1.
[131:07.48]That's, like, kind of bad, right?
[131:08.56]Alright, one more, one more, one more.
[131:11.10]Flintstone Gellon.
[131:21.49]Alright.
[131:23.96]Room reviewers panic roll too much.
[131:30.74]Oh, go- Hey!
[131:32.30]Come on, let's see your sign.
[131:39.90]They learned from the best, I was gonna say.
[131:41.68]It's true.
[131:45.31]Hold on, my- my camera's up here.
[131:52.26]Is that better?
[131:54.34]Too bright.
[131:54.72]Okay, that's good.
[132:01.07]Oh, shit.
[132:01.47]I gotta play.
[132:04.93]Hey!
[132:05.75]Are you ready?
[132:06.21]Glintstone Gellan?
[132:08.57]I imagine you're a sorcerer.
[132:09.88]Sorceress.
[132:13.50]Oh, you're doing the same thing.
[132:14.40]Ah!
[132:30.10]Whoa.
[132:32.54]Whoa.
[132:34.92]You're going to get hit.
[132:39.72]I missed block on him.
[133:03.06]Good game!
[133:03.78]I knew I was dead.
[133:04.38]Fuck.
[133:05.14]Good game.
[133:12.17]Flail.
[133:13.59]Need a little bit more reach.
[133:14.83]Panic rolling.
[133:15.73]I wasn't panic rolling.
[133:16.77]That was a good game.
[133:27.76]Alright, one more.
[133:28.46]This is too much fun to just do.
[133:30.34]That's it.
[133:30.98]One more.
[133:32.30]This is actually the last one.
[133:40.38]Promise.
[133:46.49]Last one.
[133:54.11]I would have just skipped this one, but I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[134:23.87]Where's the sus guy?
[134:42.20]I'm sorry.
[134:43.56]I'm sorry, imposter.
[134:44.60]I don't think you're here.
[134:48.58]Okay.
[134:49.04]Well, we tried.
[134:54.34]No, I'm sorry.
[134:55.08]I tried.
[134:55.50]Fiverr?
[134:56.98]A sail?
[135:02.21]Who else?
[135:05.49]Eve?
[135:09.81]You know now, round two.
[135:12.33]What do you mean, you know now?
[135:17.13]You know now, round two.
[135:20.97]Wait, did I fight this person already?
[135:32.33]This is the poise guy.
[135:33.91]Oh, okay.
[135:36.52]They changed their name.
[135:38.18]Ah, I see.
[135:40.24]You know now round two.
[135:44.66]Do you know?
[135:45.28]I mean, I remember the move, but I'm probably going to lose again.
[135:51.48]Is the one shot suck explode person?
[135:56.13]Well, let's... Shh, don't tell him.
[135:58.53]Thank you.
[136:01.41]Don't tell him.
[136:04.14]Here we go.
[136:04.42]There's the gravity on this shit, why don't you?
[136:12.12]Wait, what was that?
[136:13.98]Oh, come on.
[136:26.45]Oh, you don't expect it a second time, do you?
[136:39.17]Oh, that was good.
[136:43.37]Good fight.
[136:45.19]That was really fucking close.
[136:48.74]I figured it was going to happen and the health was not that high.
[136:54.72]That was a good fight.
[136:55.28]I was like, if this gets here before I do, then I'll win.
[137:05.35]Alright, we gotta go against Gigamog, right?
[137:12.14]There's no way that I don't fight Gigamog.
[137:18.17]How we looking today?
[137:36.01]Og?
[137:36.79]There you are.
[137:38.11]Okay.
[137:38.55]Do it.
[138:13.11]Oh!
[138:16.28]Oh, that range is not there.
[138:18.10]Bog.
[138:29.55]We're playing that game.
[138:30.77]We're playing that game.
[138:43.00]Why did I jump?
[138:43.66]Is that a stamina?
[138:49.02]Okay.
[138:49.56]Okay, Mohg.
[139:05.21]It's so funny how if you heal, if you drink during a fight, like, people from the audience is gonna start throwing shit.
[139:15.03]You know what I mean?
[139:15.45]Like, there would be, like, cups, there'd be chairs, people, like, from the stadium.
[139:20.91]Like, it would be full of, like, fucking coffee cups and fucking hamburger containers and stuff.
[139:25.57]If somebody were to drink to it, no.
[139:28.05]That's the one way to get everybody completely not on your side.
[139:32.13]Yeah, like, popcorn, like, pizzas, it would be a mess.
[139:37.38]Uh, sure.
[139:43.25]And it happens immediately, too.
[139:45.13]It's like the second that you drink, there's just fucking popcorn containers, chairs, screaming, people booing.
[139:51.95]Boo!
[139:52.95]Boo!
[139:53.47]You suck!
[139:56.74]It's immediate.
[139:59.00]Now, I'm not saying that.
[140:00.50]Because, like, I don't, whatever.
[140:02.00]It's for fun.
[140:10.46]Can you imagine if Mohg, during the boss fight, just was like... That'd be so funny.
[140:28.69]What the fuck just happened?
[140:30.35]Did somebody shoot me from the other side of the map?
[140:35.59]What?
[140:50.45]I know that move.
[140:51.43]Oh.
[141:12.16]Yo!
[141:12.36]Uh-oh.
[141:18.92]Pressure's on.
[141:19.52]Pressure's on.
[141:20.08]What the fuck?
[141:24.68]Dude, are you okay?
[141:28.36]Did he ult at four?
[141:40.44]Did you unplug your router and plug it back in?
[141:46.26]What happened?
[141:55.19]That's so funny.
[141:57.63]All of a sudden he just started sliding around.
[142:01.49]Oh god, that's so- oh my goodness.
[142:10.60]See, what actually happened there is you unplugged your router and plugged it back in, and you pissed off a lot of people, and somebody threw a fucking full large soda from the audience, and they hit me in the back of the head.
[142:25.59]I didn't do that.
[142:26.83]Somebody fucking hit me in the head with a fucking box.
[142:30.45]Okay.
[142:31.51]One more.
[142:32.65]They hit me.
[142:43.72]If that was just a coincidence, that's really funny.
[142:46.52]I don't care.
[142:47.20]Whatever.
[142:47.46]It's funny.
[142:48.80]One more.
[142:49.10]That's it.
[142:49.44]This is why Dark Souls would ever be an eSport.
[142:58.14]How cool would that be, though?
[143:00.90]Oh.
[143:03.06]Hmm.
[143:06.10]Interesting.
[143:08.35]I mean, this is the one here.
[143:09.71]This is the best two out of three, right?
[143:13.87]This is for the World Series.
[143:15.17]Let me make sure I'm ready.
[143:18.95]This is the worst game for PvP?
[143:40.12]I think this is really fun.
[143:43.04]Alright, we good?
[143:45.44]That means we're ready.
[143:46.90]Round three.
[143:47.34]This is for all the marbles here.
[144:00.32]And I'm waiting for you to do it.
[144:22.11]Not ready Good game That was about to be really close If you pulled me in
[144:44.83]Like, one second earlier.
[144:47.89]You win.
[144:48.07]Good game.
[144:54.77]Alright, how about one more?
[144:57.27]No, I'm not peeing myself.
[144:59.34]Scam God.
[145:00.22]I don't know, you have scam in your name.
[145:03.12]I'm, like, kind of afraid to summon you.
[145:04.26]How about Beeb?
[145:14.94]Alright, I promise I'm gonna go invade after this.
[145:32.34]It would be actually really cool if FromSoftware... I know they have like the... you collect fingers and phantom fingers, right?
[145:39.48]Or whatever.
[145:39.90]They had the covenants before.
[145:42.86]Having an actually ranked system in this game I think would be really... Watch that stamina.
[146:15.82]Oh.
[146:22.20]Oh, what a comeback.
[146:24.12]Oh, what a comeback.
[146:25.30]Damn.
[146:26.74]That was really, that was, what a great comeback.
[146:31.67]I was trying to get too fancy with it.
[146:32.73]I should have just went in and swung.
[146:34.81]That was, yeah, that was.
[146:36.35]No, I didn't throw.
[146:37.17]That was a great comeback.
[146:41.97]I ran out of stamina.
[146:43.57]I tried to dodge and I didn't.
[146:46.51]No, that's not a throw!
[146:48.23]That was a great com- That was great gameplay from the other player.
[146:51.81]Alright, last one.
[147:09.32]No, I don't- Yeah.
[147:13.72]This person looks interesting.
[147:14.88]Alright.
[147:16.80]Joseph.
[147:19.88]Joseph has a slab of concrete.
[147:35.07]It's a fingerprint shield.
[147:36.29]ResidentSleeper.
[147:36.95]What does that do?
[147:43.28]Wiser point.
[147:48.08]Okay.
[148:07.08]What are you doing?
[148:10.33]Wait, do we get to wait until he does all those Warcraft buffs?
[148:13.03]Or can I attack him?
[148:15.50]Okay, I'm going in?
[148:18.84]What are you doing?
[148:20.98]Should I attack?
[148:22.16]Are we ready?
[148:46.85]Oh, this guy's a million poised.
[148:56.94]Never mind.
[149:14.21]Should I dodge in front of him?
[150:01.33]Oh!
[150:03.75]That was close.
[150:10.79]That was a boss.
[150:12.97]That was a boss for me.
[150:14.42]That was really hard.
[150:23.50]That was a Redditor?
[150:24.26]How can you tell when somebody's a Redditor?
[150:26.58]I don't get it.
[150:27.28]Alright, I'm thinking about it.
[150:36.58]Alright.
[150:41.60]to summon the person that's called Barf Drinker, okay?
[150:45.88]And then that's it.
[150:50.43]You have a disgusting name.
[150:51.99]You obviously have any outfit that you have on.
[150:55.07]Your name is Barf Drinker.
[150:58.13]And then I promise I'm going to go do invasions.
[150:59.77]I promise.
[151:00.11]This is the last one.
[151:02.84]If I do another PvP summoning sign thing in this spot right after this fight...
[151:10.02]And within five minutes of this one... You know what?
[151:12.94]I don't care about semantics.
[151:14.00]I'll delete my channel if I do another one.
[151:16.56]You know what I mean?
[151:17.00]Like, if I do another one in a row right now, in the next five minutes... Alright, barf drinker, what's up?
[151:27.85]I'm gonna get BM'd, aren't I?
[151:33.07]It's so stupid!
[151:40.16]Rocks at me.
[151:53.47]What the fuck?
[152:06.56]What the hell is happening here?
[152:10.13]How did you avoid that?
[152:16.71]You dick!
[152:18.01]Oh, dick!
[152:22.55]He wants to poison me and end it.
[152:24.95]Your cockiness is gonna be the end here for you.
[152:28.19]This cockiness is gonna get you killed, man.
[152:30.07]I'm telling you.
[152:30.57]This cocky behavior is gonna get you killed.
[152:32.04]I'm saying it.
[152:35.28]He wants to end it with a fucking... Oh, I'm gonna shoot him with a cannon!
[152:38.84]No, you're not.
[152:44.53]This person's freaking me out.
[152:45.41]I don't know what they're gonna do next.
[152:55.32]Fine.
[153:00.93]I can play that game too, you know.
[153:19.59]I thought I was going to kill him too.
[153:21.37]That was crazy.
[153:28.24]I'm telling you.
[153:29.36]That was close.
[153:32.82]Alright.
[153:34.18]I'm leaving.
[153:34.54]I'm going to go to... Like up here.
[153:42.70]The Haligtree or something.
[153:43.64]Like up here.
[153:46.65]Yeah.
[153:46.95]Like right up here on the roots.
[153:51.22]What was my record?
[153:51.80]Anybody keep track?
[153:53.70]What was the KD there?
[154:15.32]Come on.
[154:15.96]Someone in the group has become a lord.
[154:21.33]What?
[154:23.53]What the hell does that mean?
[154:27.21]Did somebody using this password beat the game?
[154:29.53]That's so funny.
[154:35.28]Can I not invade anybody on the tree?
[154:38.24]Somebody just ended the game.
[154:39.68]That's so cute that it does that.
[154:53.92]Wait, and you get a buff, too?
[154:57.20]Really?
[154:59.08]That's pretty cool.
[154:59.56]Alright, nobody wants to fight here.
[155:02.66]How are there not people right here?
[155:05.36]There's so many people at this soul level coming in here.
[155:08.52]That's impossible.
[155:19.21]Sometimes it says Lord, sometimes it says Elden Lord.
[155:21.75]It's really weird.
[155:22.63]Sometimes it says nothing.
[155:23.55]It's weird.
[155:25.55]I don't know what the fuck I was just doing.
[155:28.80]I just walked off.
[155:30.04]I, for some reason, thought I was in a different zone.
[155:33.96]I was very strange.
[155:34.90]I don't know why I just did that.
[155:38.80]Depends on the ending.
[155:39.52]Oh, that's cool.
[155:42.66]That was apparently a bad place to do this anyways.
[155:53.49]Okay, there's probably more people here.
[156:03.53]Your level's very high, so it might be hard to fight people.
[156:07.69]Yeah, I mean, I am, like, end stage.
[156:11.21]Final ending.
[156:13.50]I was 150 when I beat the game, right?
[156:14.54]145, maybe?
[156:14.70]Alright, let's do it.
[156:25.23]Where they at?
[156:28.60]Defeat P-break.
[156:49.65]What's going on over there?
[156:50.47]That was really weird.
[156:52.59]Okay.
[157:18.67]I hear footsteps.
[157:20.05]Where are they?
[157:20.45]Are they on top?
[157:27.88]Oh my god, that was terrifying.
[157:50.66]I guess they could just turn the stream on if we have the same password.
[157:56.36]It worked.
[157:58.80]That was a really loud scream.
[158:00.26]I'm sorry.
[158:00.75]That was fucking horrible.
[158:11.58]Invasions don't work with a password.
[158:13.52]Oh, alright.
[158:26.41]oh come on that okay whoever I invaded oh man you would you probably went like this no
[158:47.99]just barely missed came right down sliced in the animation landed right next to me you must been lying in that shot up being like oh my god he actually doesn't know and you just miss oh that would that's so sad I'm so sorry I almost went off with you though I actually almost fell off with you
[159:22.42]The lunge attack never works.
[159:24.56]I honestly don't... I feel like it got worse.
[159:27.84]I remember in Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2, the Fall R1 was insanely good.
[159:39.31]I feel like I'm terrible.
[159:40.01]I don't want to use it in these newer games.
[159:41.39]I feel like it's awful.
[159:42.75]I can never get it to work.
[159:48.38]It still is.
[159:49.08]It made it harder to hit then, probably.
[159:55.37]What am I doing?
[159:57.25]Um, trying to invade?
[160:02.11]Baramuzula should be non-stop invasions at this level.
[160:06.37]You know what?
[160:06.65]That's a good point.
[160:08.67]Okay, we'll see if this works.
[160:11.34]Jump R2 is really good.
[160:12.36]Yeah, jump.
[160:13.08]The jumping R2 is.
[160:14.06]That's one of the probably best moves in the whole game.
[160:19.16]This is probably the best single move you can do to anything in the whole game.
[160:27.05]Alright, 10 more seconds and I'm gonna go to Faramazool.
[160:29.61]Alright, fuck it, just die.
[160:39.01]Because, like, I'm not gonna be able to... Reminder that you promised you would eat a glove if the three stooges were... I didn't... Whatever.
[160:48.65]That's doctored footage.
[160:51.57]I didn't say that.
[160:58.42]Alright, Ferramozzolo.
[160:59.10]Where should I go?
[161:01.55]Just kind of right here?
[161:02.19]Right on the bridge.
[161:06.29]Right here.
[161:06.55]Yeah, passwords don't matter for invasions.
[161:22.53]Yeah, that makes sense though, doesn't it?
[161:26.53]Otherwise, wouldn't you kind of just be able to...
[161:29.64]farm invasions with your friends?
[161:32.50]I actually don't really know how this works, but... Really?
[161:57.42]You having trouble finding people?
[161:58.46]150 here?
[162:06.46]Please, Jerma, help me beat the last boss.
[162:08.10]I'm on it right now, and it'll be my first win.
[162:11.31]Yeah, I'm going to do help.
[162:15.29]I'll try help.
[162:17.65]Spam the finger.
[162:18.45]Should I go with one of the other bonfires?
[162:29.28]150 plus is considered over-leveled.
[162:32.02]Um, I don't... Is it though?
[162:34.48]I thought maybe like 180 or something.
[162:37.08]I was like 120 when I was here.
[162:40.14]Like 140.
[162:40.48]Who died?
[162:51.65]What?
[162:52.49]Somebody's dead.
[162:53.43]Who the fuck are these people?
[162:54.81]What's going on?
[162:56.95]I came in and somebody died.
[163:01.28]Wait, we didn't even bow yet!
[163:03.36]What happened?
[163:07.30]The reason why, I zoned into the game and it was like, that person, somebody died.
[163:12.02]I was like, oh, I'm going to get returned to my world.
[163:14.00]I don't know what happened.
[163:18.92]It said, recuse and die.
[163:20.38]Was that another invader?
[163:21.48]That was a different invader that died and then I came, wow, we look really stupid.
[163:31.68]Back-to-back invasions and the... I come in and just kind of walk around and die in there.
[163:36.40]I didn't even fight anybody.
[163:39.29]That was so bad.
[163:40.19]I just kind of fell off the edge and they just bullied me.
[163:47.65]There are no rules in it.
[163:48.75]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[163:49.59]I gotta... I gotta get that into my head.
[163:54.43]I have to act like a FromSoftware NPC.
[163:57.64]I'm gonna show you exactly what that means.
[164:06.39]Okay.
[164:07.27]Please don't go in the boss room.
[164:10.38]There you are.
[164:10.92]Okay.

[165:24.14]Okay, that was confusing.
[165:26.24]Okay.
[165:27.54]Alright.
[165:28.34]I get it.
[165:28.66]I get it.

[165:41.09]Stop.
[165:41.99]Okay.
[165:42.75]Alright, fine.
[165:43.19]No honor.
[165:43.87]There's no honor?
[165:47.09]Someone in the group defeated the Shardbearer.
[165:55.74]Use the Tree Sentinel to your advantage.
[165:57.76]Oh my god.
[165:58.44]Just stand next to it.
[166:01.19]Stand next to it and taunt.
[166:12.90]Tree Sentinel is usually dead.
[166:14.18]Alright, let's go.
[166:15.52]Hey.
[166:52.02]This is bullshit.
[166:54.26]This is... It's bullshit.
[166:55.46]This is bullshit.
[167:00.35]Yeah, this is absolutely... I look like an asshole.
[167:06.43]Wait, I'm invisible, aren't I?
[167:10.91]Where's the other player?
[167:13.11]Are there two players?
[167:31.32]I don't know how either one of us didn't get hit by that.
[168:02.08]What the fuck?
[168:06.10]Use the explosive flask.
[168:34.75]I... I mean, it's so... If it was me... I'm just trying to think if this is me doing this.
[168:42.19]Like, playing and somebody invaded me.
[168:44.29]And I was fighting the Tree Sentinel.
[168:45.69]Like, I had just gotten here maybe like 10 minutes ago.
[168:48.69]I'm fighting the Tree Sentinel.
[168:50.56]And somebody invades me.
[168:52.36]And drinks the Exploding Flask.
[168:54.26]And LOLs me at the boss.
[168:56.14]I'd probably fucking be pissed.
[168:59.80]I would probably flip out.
[169:01.10]I'd be like... I would be so mad.
[169:06.62]That was me.
[169:07.24]It was a connection error.
[169:08.34]Aw, too bad.
[169:09.02]Good fight, though.
[169:09.54]Uh, I did try to BM and cheese you.
[169:13.25]And... That's, uh, that's what I deserve to be disconnected from.
[169:19.81]There we go.
[169:28.49]It's like you were waiting for me.
[169:30.24]You knew I was going to spawn in this spot.
[169:33.18]Alright, is FreeSentinel alive?
[169:36.87]Fuck, you killed the tree, Sentinel.
[169:38.41]You guys played.
[169:40.95]Alright, okay, easy.
[169:48.52]I don't know what I was just doing that for.
[169:49.72]I was trying to freak him out.
[170:06.95]I don't know why I figured, like, I don't know.
[170:08.37]Sometimes people do, like, the monkey see, monkey do thing where I jumped up on the balcony and jumped.
[170:14.65]I'm kind of one of these people.
[170:15.51]I'd be like, alright, fine.
[170:16.15]I'll do that, too.
[170:16.81]I'll show you.
[170:17.35]I'm not an idiot.
[170:17.89]I can do it.
[170:18.49]And then they jump up.

[172:34.98]On the rooftops here.
[172:40.90]Yeah, like over here somewhere.
[172:41.84]Somewhere weird.
[172:43.86]I like this.
[172:46.71]Is they gonna be jumping around here?
[172:48.55]Especially in this area right there.
[172:49.81]They're gonna be jumping to that area.
[173:00.62]Dragon fight is a good spot.

[174:40.31]This poor guy.
[175:01.49]Ahhhh!
[175:12.23]The birds were dead up here.
[175:14.69]Were you trying to run off the edge?
[175:16.11]I think he was trying to jump off.
[175:17.97]I think he was trying to get killed.
[175:19.74]If you'd stayed up there, you would have probably had a better shot.
[175:28.32]Why scarlet rot?
[175:30.40]Uh, we got any signs here?

[179:21.30]Who, uh... Who wants to go for it?
[179:24.76]Okay.
[179:27.06]Who wants to go for it?
[179:27.87]Who wants to go for, uh... This is gonna be a disaster.
[179:36.21]You can wear a helmet.
[179:37.69]A helmet of your choice.
[179:38.65]I don't know if I like that.
[179:50.07]I kinda like that.
[179:50.91]I kinda like this.
[179:51.55]Alright, we gotta go against the Grinch.
[179:58.26]Is there a block or a parry or anything?
[180:12.04]Here we go.
[180:21.02]Alright Grinch, you know the rules.
[180:49.75]This is gonna take fucking forever.
[180:55.20]Uh oh.
[181:08.39]I just baited it out.
[181:29.58]Oops.
[181:32.80]I did that.
[181:33.50]I was gonna go.
[181:43.57]That was fun.
[181:43.95]Let's not do that ever again.
[181:56.20]Alright, I have a new game.
[181:58.11]The new game is... Can you knock me off this platform in one minute?
[182:04.95]I'm going to look like a total dickhead.
[182:09.78]You have to knock me off the platform in one minute.
[182:12.42]However you do it.
[182:13.38]Whatever means necessary.
[182:14.12]Alright, how much strength do I need to put on some of these great shields?
[182:19.78]Okay, I can put this one on.
[182:20.58]This is 90.
[182:20.94]I need 100.
[182:24.61]No.
[182:25.57]28.
[182:25.59]30.
[182:25.61]20.
[182:27.01]Okay.
[182:29.07]I'm going to go respec to 99 endurance.
[182:33.64]And like 30 strength.
[182:34.80]Perfect.
[182:48.13]You have one minute to get rid of me.
[182:56.43]Uh, yeah, my current stats.
[182:58.35]Somebody remember this.
[182:59.05]Because I won't.
[183:05.12]Okay, here we go.
[183:23.15]This is so annoying.
[183:25.58]Alright, 95 I need not mind.
[183:32.26]I need enough to hold two great shields in my hand.
[183:36.83]Will 27 do it?
[183:37.85]30 strength should do it, right?
[183:46.97]Soft cap is 80.
[183:47.51]Strength for shield, 35.
[183:59.23]60 is soft cap.
[184:02.41]60, 60, 60.
[184:05.18]And we use any weapon.
[184:05.98]You can use anything you want.
[184:06.94]You can use literally anything in the game.
[184:17.46]No, I want... I think this is fine.
[184:21.15]80 is hard cap.
[184:21.81]Yeah.
[184:22.15]Okay.
[184:22.39]I think this is fine.
[184:26.43]Am I going to be naked?
[184:27.13]No.
[184:28.11]Absolutely not.
[184:42.17]I need the heaviest shield in the whole game.
[184:45.27]It's probably this.
[184:50.21]Okay.
[185:03.18]What's the heaviest armor in the whole game?
[185:04.43]Probably this, right?
[185:06.41]The lionel stuff.
[185:10.70]Or is it the pumpkin head?
[185:15.74]Whole goat?
[185:25.36]Whole goat everything?
[185:26.00]Yeah.
[185:32.18]Okay.
[185:37.53]Now I need... Greatly increases maximum HP.
[185:45.92]I need... I don't care about equipment alone.
[185:53.10]I need... Enormously boosts physical damage negation.
[186:02.83]What else?
[186:05.70]Vastly magic defense.
[186:12.10]And... I wonder.
[186:15.83]Stamina.
[186:20.17]Good luck.
[186:20.43]Good luck.
[186:29.96]Shield talisman?
[186:37.15]I have it on.
[186:43.50]Raise his defense when HP is at maximum.
[186:46.50]Go upgrade the shields.
[186:49.30]I don't have it.
[186:51.22]Should I go upgrade these bolts plus 10?
[186:52.90]I feel like that's such a waste.
[187:02.09]At least I plus 8 or plus 9.
[187:03.29]Yeah.
[187:06.48]I don't have the runes to do that.
[187:08.04]I have remembrances that I'm not going to use.
[187:09.58]I got a lot.
[187:10.85]Alright, I'm going to... Both these shields are going to get plus 9.
[187:26.08]Oh, nice.
[187:26.52]Congrats.
[187:27.78]30,000 should do it.
[187:38.46]You can only block with one of them.
[187:39.74]I think the one on the right is more effective, right?
[187:43.48]Let's see if I can do it.
[187:47.30]Which one is better?
[187:47.88]The one on my right hand is more damage negation, right?
[187:54.66]Upgrading shield does literally nothing for their defense.
[187:56.82]Does it do anything?
[187:57.40]It just increases the damage.
[188:01.94]Oh, okay.
[188:07.81]Fingerprint shield has 100% physical damage.
[188:12.58]Makes him use less stamina when blocking.
[188:14.38]It increases... Okay.
[188:15.28]I'm just going to do it.
[188:16.02]Who cares?
[188:18.60]If we break your guard, then can we... Yeah.
[188:20.38]However you can get rid of me.
[188:26.27]This one's good, though, right?
[188:28.31]This thing?
[188:28.67]I think this is the one.
[188:30.13]I don't want to go get the other shield.
[188:33.87]How easy is it?
[188:39.05]Is it, like, simple to go get it?
[188:48.16]Not very.
[188:48.46]Alright.
[188:48.70]Well, I'm just going to do... Which one is better for defense?
[188:50.58]This one, probably.
[188:51.44]This one here.
[188:51.78]Alright.
[188:52.50]I'm going for it.
[188:59.83]Hold on.
[189:08.58]How many do I need?
[189:09.28]I have access to every single stone in the game besides the plus 10 one.
[189:18.24]Alright, Smithing Stone.
[189:19.86]How many do I need?
[189:22.63]I have 15, 30, 29, 20.
[189:25.05]I have a shitload of these.
[189:31.59]12 per stone.
[189:32.31]Alright, well, I don't have any plus 1 smithing stones.
[189:38.88]I need, you don't even have the basic ones.
[189:41.06]You don't have access to smithing stones one?
[189:43.42]What the fuck?
[189:49.66]You missed out on a lot of early dungeons?
[189:55.38]Whatever, I'm just going, I'm going to summon people.
[190:04.08]Zero exploration Andy.
[190:05.33]That's not true.

[190:23.20]Let's do it.
[190:23.60]Good luck, everybody.
[190:24.62]You have one minute.
[190:29.62]Get rid of me.
[190:32.09]I'll knock you off.
[190:32.91]Okay.
[190:33.05]I'm going to get right in the middle.
[190:50.75]By the way, I can push you if I want to.

[193:54.97]Hmm.
[194:00.45]Alright, fine.
[194:08.33]If you get me in the first move,

[198:03.94]Now it's heavy load.
[198:04.82]Shit.
[198:05.20]Okay.
[198:05.50]Well, that makes sense.
[198:13.18]Okay.
[198:13.84]Now I want to do moves that... I want to do the FP flask.
[198:21.63]They could sneeze and kill you.
[198:22.67]I know, but I'm going to be able just to spam moves.
[198:27.39]If I touch somebody with a move, they're dead.
[198:31.33]Okay.
[198:31.43]Okay.
[198:35.46]Where do I want to do this?
[198:39.48]How about, like, right... How about where, um... Yeah, like, down here.
[198:42.74]No, no one's going to be there.
[198:43.52]Maybe, like, one of these, uh... Like, the church or the halic tree?
[198:50.21]Or the foot of the forge.
[198:56.17]The image is not going to be that crazy.
[198:57.75]Well, whatever.
[199:01.33]Now, if I were... It was fine.
[199:02.87]Let's go here.
[199:06.55]Worst build that takes five minutes to set up.
[199:12.03]Alright, I need to put on the FP stuff.
[199:13.93]This is just an experiment.
[199:27.64]I want the all FP consumption and the magic boost.
[199:33.18]Or is it?
[199:41.69]Is there a magic boost one?
[199:45.75]I don't think so.
[199:48.17]Stamina?
[199:53.41]Oh, there it is again.
[199:56.80]Okay, here we go.
[199:57.62]This is so bad, but whatever.
[199:59.30]I'm just going to be annoying.
[200:05.64]I'm thinking the moon.
[200:07.72]I have a ton of decks, too.
[200:08.72]Alright.
[200:11.27]What would be annoying here?
[200:13.41]Probably... This?
[200:18.28]Probably... Maybe like collapsing stars?
[200:24.70]That would be kind of annoying.
[200:27.47]I'll try this.
[200:32.47]Magic downpour?
[200:34.31]That's a good idea actually.
[200:35.51]I'll do that.
[200:42.88]Mmm, yeah, the moon's gonna take too long.
[200:46.22]Founding Rain of Stars, or... I think Founding... I'm gonna try Founding Rain of Stars.
[200:52.57]I feel like that's really irritating.
[200:55.35]Magic Downpour?
[200:56.15]I'll try it.
[200:56.57]Fine.
[201:06.36]Here we go.
[201:15.27]Do all mana flasks so you don't die in one hit.
[201:16.99]Oh, you're right.
[201:18.64]It's alright.
[201:24.34]I'm going to confuse the person that I invade though because they're going to hit me one time and I'm going to die.
[201:42.57]All the way over there?
[201:48.78]Oh, you're so far away.
[201:50.28]How am I gonna get over there?
[202:02.02]Use the finger again?
[202:05.92]How do I do it?
[202:07.86]How do I use the finger again?
[202:15.49]Oh, repeat.
[202:23.99]Ready?
[202:24.37]Here we go.
[202:45.14]Come on, I want to do my stupid shit.
[202:51.53]That actually might be really good.
[202:52.75]What about Crisp Release?
[202:55.86]Oh, that's annoying too.
[202:56.90]Okay.
[203:01.42]This one is... What does this one do?
[203:09.64]That's actually probably really annoying too.
[203:15.73]Magic Downpour.
[203:19.97]Magic Downpour I think is the best one to do with this much intelligence.
[203:28.60]Quickly, hurry, hurry, quickly.
[203:29.82]Oh my fucking god, come on.
[203:36.17]I'm not even close to that.
[203:37.17]I'm going far away.
[203:58.38]This is a bad place to be, too.
[203:59.52]This is gonna be great.
[204:00.12]Why are you eating a glove if you're having this many invasions?
[204:07.86]Problems.
[204:09.32]No, I'm just in a bad- I'm doing it in a bad spot.
[204:10.96]Here we go.
[204:11.26]This is better.
[204:11.78]Alright, here we go.
[204:12.91]3, 2, 1, action.
[204:17.37]What the fuck?
[204:17.99]I thought that was them.
[204:20.45]Where are they?
[204:43.00]What?
[204:43.42]No!
[204:43.94]Fuck!
[204:44.50]I thought they were right around the corner.
[204:45.94]No!
[204:51.08]I thought they were gonna... I heard the fighting right there.
[204:53.52]Alright, I'm just fucking running at them.
[204:55.48]No more hiding.
[204:56.90]No more hiding.
[204:57.50]And my voice is doing the thing.
[205:03.16]Farum Azula is too condensed.
[205:04.38]There's like too many bosses.
[205:05.80]Everyone that's here is doing one of the two bosses here.
[205:22.01]Where did it put me?
[205:41.40]Where the fuck are they?
[205:42.50]Are they above me?
[205:51.87]How do I get up there?
[205:52.57]I don't remember the layout of this place.
[205:54.09]I did it one time.
[205:55.23]How do I get up?
[206:03.76]These stairs don't go anywhere.
[206:06.00]I actually don't know how to get the fuck up there.
[206:13.69]God damn it.
[206:14.65]This fucking inventory.
[206:15.97]I just put...
[206:25.36]I gotta get out of Faramazool.
[206:26.52]Faramazool is like, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, and there's two bosses, everybody's doing it.
[206:31.20]No, fuck this place.
[206:32.73]No.
[206:44.57]There's like three bosses, like, here, here, and here, and everyone's just gonna walk in the boss door.
[206:51.00]I gotta go somewhere else.
[206:54.88]My game just crashed.
[206:55.76]What happened?
[207:04.63]I'm going over here.
[207:05.61]I'm going to fucking Lyndell.
[207:08.11]Frozen Lake?
[207:15.51]Ah.
[207:19.52]Let me try this and see if it works.
[207:30.23]Come on.
[207:30.61]Where is it?
[207:34.21]Where is it?
[207:36.74]Inventory.
[207:37.32]I don't get it.
[207:46.58]There you are.
[207:47.18]I'm fucking ready.
[207:47.92]Let's go.
[207:48.58]Enough of this bullshit.
[207:49.66]There you are.
[207:50.26]I just saw you.
[207:54.60]You're right here.
[208:10.16]Oh, shit!
[208:22.87]Oh, my God!
[208:23.79]Why did that not... What?
[208:24.53]That didn't even hit him?
[208:28.13]How did that not hit him?
[208:29.05]It hit him directly in the face!
[208:45.25]What the fuck?
[209:01.36]These moves suck I have to- okay
[209:09.55]Somebody said, dude, all you did is effectively turn yourself into one of those shitty magic enemies.
[209:14.26]I died.
[209:14.72]I really am an enemy.
[209:22.69]I really just turned myself into one of the mages from Raya Lucaria that died in two swings.
[209:27.01]Not even one swing.
[209:33.38]Alright.
[209:41.08]NPC build.
[209:45.07]Collapsing stars.
[209:45.75]I'm just going to spam it.
[209:51.03]Minus one larval tier.
[209:52.05]They give you like a hundred.
[209:53.31]It's fine.
[209:53.69]Okay.
[210:02.72]Two more summon signs.
[210:03.64]Yeah, we will.
[210:05.74]I want to get summoned for cooperation after this though.
[210:16.98]Hey, where are you?
[210:34.69]What the fuck was that?
[210:40.85]This is a hacker!
[210:42.35]This is a hacker!
[210:43.39]This is a hacker!
[210:44.73]This is a hacker!
[210:45.95]He's blowing up the... Quick and leave!
[210:47.53]Quick!
[210:48.33]Quick, get out!
[210:48.81]I have to leave!
[210:50.17]I gotta leave!
[210:50.61]He's gonna crash my computer!
[210:51.85]He's gonna crash my computer!
[210:52.81]I gotta go!
[211:00.46]Okay.
[211:18.42]They were gonna crash my computer.
[211:19.47]I had to run.
[211:47.73]Is it a cheat engine?
[211:48.79]Oh, fuck.
[211:55.67]I need to back up my save.
[211:57.75]Oh, fuck no.
[212:09.76]I want... Should I try a different area?
[212:26.48]How do I back up my save?
[212:28.82]How do I back my save up?
[212:30.28]Quick!
[212:31.54]Where do I go to back the save up?
[212:33.08]How do I do it?
[212:33.52]How do I do it?
[212:33.94]Quick, tell me!
[212:35.12]Defrag your hard drive.
[212:36.10]Alright, I'm gonna defrag my hard drive.
[212:38.31]I'm gonna back up my save.
[212:39.91]I'm gonna... You're fine.
[212:50.49]I'm gonna put it on a floppy disk.
[213:01.40]It's app data?
[213:06.06]Okay.
[213:06.28]Dude, dude, you gotta do a full virus scan now.
[213:13.17]Alright, alright.
[213:13.89]I wanna- Let's do some more PvP.
[213:18.81]Oh, no.
[213:19.13]Who needs help?
[213:22.04]I- Let me get- Let me even- I wanna fight some people with this build.
[213:32.53]I want to see if I can at least kill one person with this.
[213:34.29]Hello, this is Kaspersky Security.
[213:45.91]How can I help you?
[213:49.65]Somebody's in my Elden Ring game.
[213:52.35]And they... Did a bunch of exploding spells.
[213:57.26]What do I do?
[214:05.51]That was insane, though.
[214:06.43]What the fuck?
[214:07.85]Okay.
[214:10.05]Uh, let's do signs.
[214:10.71]Alright.
[214:22.24]Our speed wagon.
[214:25.38]I tried to summon you already.
[214:26.26]It didn't work.
[214:26.64]Alright, how about you?
[214:32.91]This is gonna be so bad now.
[214:36.99]I mean, who knows?
[214:37.75]I might be able to actually kill somebody.
[214:54.10]We're at 153 soul level.
[215:03.11]I was more concerned about my computer crashing.
[215:15.08]Why do I have, like, five vigor?
[215:17.50]It's because this is a... I was doing an invasion build where I would go in and try to kill people in, like, one hit.
[215:23.13]I got embarrassed three times in a row.
[215:27.09]And then I, uh... And then I had to come back here.
[215:41.69]They seem friendly.
[215:42.57]You should still back up the save.
[215:43.95]I mean, as long as they're not going to try to get mad.
[215:47.21]I don't know.
[215:57.12]Does cross region stop west to east coast?
[216:05.29]I'm sorry.
[216:05.67]It didn't work.
[216:06.17]There's a classic barf drinker.
[216:10.74]Alright, Captain Lugario.
[216:12.14]You're gonna die twice and spend 10 minutes trying to fix the NPC build.
[216:48.13]Oh, I just realized you have to hit me once alright just let's go Oh
[217:08.86]Alright, I'm done with this build.
[217:10.84]I'm done.
[217:11.10]This build is just... Why am I using Magic Downpour, by the way?
[217:16.29]Magic Downpour is literally a serial block skill.
[217:19.03]You get it, you use it once, and then you fucking delete it from your bar and never put it back on.
[217:22.29]There's just no reason to put it on.
[217:26.29]There's no reason to put this back on.
[217:27.69]Alright, let's go... Let me go... So bad.
[217:32.08]I just...
[217:39.64]I'll be right back.
[217:40.22]Nobody move.
[217:40.66]Alright, let me see.
[217:49.76]What do I got in my... Okay, it was 50... I believe it was 50?
[217:59.12]30?
[217:59.14]Or like, no.
[218:00.15]30, maybe like 35?
[218:01.39]Let's do it.
[218:01.75]I got it right here.
[218:11.78]31?
[218:11.88]We'll do 35.
[218:12.78]That sounds better.
[218:19.40]Okay.
[218:19.88]25 dex.
[218:20.44]Should I even have dex at this point?
[218:22.72]Probably, yeah.
[218:28.23]65 intelligence?
[218:30.63]Wait, that's including items that I had on.
[218:35.53]Isn't it?
[218:43.96]I think that's kind of... I think that's pretty good.
[218:46.74]It does not include... This does not include items.
[218:50.52]I think that's because of the baby rattle was... What was my dex?
[218:54.92]Uh, it was 25, 65.
[218:57.62]56.
[218:57.90]Is there... Oh my god, I have no points in endurance.
[219:05.05]That's why.
[219:05.45]Alright.
[219:13.29]Um...
[219:15.11]Prince was 30.
[219:15.47]Okay.
[219:24.86]Mind is a dump stat.
[219:25.90]You can just chug for more.
[219:27.20]Yeah, I gotta pee again.
[219:28.12]What the fuck?
[219:31.58]30, 31.
[219:32.02]565.
[219:34.17]I think this is fine.
[219:37.65]Actually, I want like 30.
[219:38.27]30, mind.
[219:38.65]30, 30.
[219:53.49]That's fine.
[219:56.03]That's fine.
[220:01.32]Yeah, that's pretty much where it was before.
[220:02.56]I could wear something better than this, though.
[220:20.84]Back to reality here.
[220:28.29]It's not the right one.
[220:29.47]Okay, here we go.
[220:31.03]It's time for a couple more PvP duels after I pee.
[220:35.53]I'll do one before I pee.
[220:36.73]Same place.
[220:47.36]I've been playing for four hours?
[220:53.19]That's kind of blown by.
[220:54.33]I must be having fun.
[221:02.92]I don't know.
[221:03.28]I just summoned somebody, I think.
[221:06.90]Tired... I don't know.
[221:10.94]Tired low?
[221:19.50]Oh, I have such... These spells suck.
[221:21.62]It's okay.
[221:22.40]I really only need these two.
[221:29.94]Tired hollow.
[221:30.70]Okay.
[221:32.42]It's because of HO.
[222:01.06]Ooh, that was rough.
[222:11.18]Oh, good game.
[222:12.46]Damn it.
[222:13.78]Good game.
[222:14.54]I thought you were going to come in a little bit further.
[222:16.02]Are you going to help people fight bosses?
[222:21.18]Yeah.
[222:22.33]I'll do this for a little bit longer.
[222:28.72]That was a tuba reaction, too.
[222:31.03]Becoming aware of that.
[222:42.43]Europina.
[222:46.22]Luna.
[222:47.32]Kick me strong.
[222:52.56]Okay.
[222:54.78]Spells, but...
[223:01.29]You should help people with Malenia.
[223:04.61]I will stand and I will help people outside of different bosses.
[223:07.77]I will.
[223:09.03]That sounds fun.
[223:15.72]I guess I could take this, right?
[223:17.70]Wondrous Pizik Blaster.
[223:18.74]Okay.
[223:27.76]We good?
[223:32.37]You good?
[223:37.15]Are you good?
[223:47.80]Hey!
[223:52.57]Okay, here we go.
[223:58.13]Good fight.
[224:29.11]I'll do cross region in a minute.
[224:33.87]Stealth archer.
[224:42.06]I don't know, but I don't know about this one.
[224:43.16]This one's kind of freaking me out.
[224:46.04]Does that mean that the character is going to be invisible and they're going to shoot me with a bow and arrow?
[224:53.56]That's kind of sus.
[225:15.50]This is the best class in the game.
[225:34.39]Hey, what's up?
[225:36.61]Alright, what do you got?
[225:39.29]Stealth Archer?
[225:49.38]Oh.
[225:54.83]I get it.
[225:55.25]I can see you.
[225:57.71]You're moving too close.
[226:03.30]You shot him in the sky?
[226:04.44]I'm so confused.
[226:05.28]Okay.
[226:06.10]Nobody plays with bows in this game, huh?
[226:39.05]Bo seems so cool.
[226:42.28]so so
[227:11.89]God damn it.
[227:18.85]Those are cool looking.
[227:19.79]They're like little crystals.
[227:31.95]Fight.
[227:34.12]That was actually really cool.
[227:36.48]What are those arrows?
[227:40.76]That was really cool.
[227:50.71]They're rainbow stone arrows.
[227:52.06]That's really all.
[227:52.86]I actually kind of want to play as that character.
[227:57.58]Toot toot.
[228:07.25]Oh, my computer crashed.
[228:15.70]Did my whole computer crash?
[228:21.93]Come on.
[228:45.90]Can you level up a few?
[228:46.88]Do you have to be the exact same level?
[228:51.77]I don't think it would be the same exact level.
[228:59.31]Was it like, it's like 5 level range?
[229:00.95]10 level range?
[229:05.17]The level, oh, level doesn't matter with a password, okay.
[229:13.28]So wait, so that means that people could...
[229:18.48]I could be fighting people that are way, way lower than me.
[229:21.06]Right?
[229:21.72]Technically.
[229:29.53]Yeah, yeah.
[229:36.65]I thought I got banned.
[229:37.33]I was like, oh no.
[229:40.06]I saw the pop-up.
[229:41.54]The second pop-up and I'm like, oh no.
[229:47.02]I am not used to seeing a second pop-up window.
[230:04.20]Crap.
[230:06.26]I think that was just an actual crash.
[230:11.94]Which...
[230:16.01]So what happened between Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, and this game?
[230:21.41]Because game cra- like hardware.
[230:26.35]Those didn't happen in Sekiro.
[230:28.23]They didn't happen in Dark Souls 3 either.
[230:31.95]I don't remember it happening.
[230:33.51]Did the game crash one time when I played?
[230:36.40]Because it's open world.
[230:37.36]All the shaders.
[230:38.42]Maybe, yeah.
[230:39.50]Alright, yeah, let me go pee.
[230:40.14]I'll be right back.
[230:41.60]I'll be right back.
[230:42.18]Pee.
[234:44.64]I'm back.
[234:46.40]Okay, so we'll do a few more of these PvP rounds.
[234:50.97]And then we'll do some summons to do bosses.
[234:54.03]That sounds fun.
[234:57.09]Is cross region on?
[234:59.20]I'll end with that.
[235:00.50]We'll do that in an hour or two.
[235:01.46]Hello.
[235:05.44]Turn the audio back on.
[235:20.73]Alrighty.
[235:22.79]Cross region.
[235:23.33]You know what?
[235:23.67]Let's just do it now.
[235:25.09]I'll put cross region on.
[235:25.88]Do it from here.
[235:34.02]Oh, it's like an actual setting.
[235:37.52]Cross region.
[235:38.30]Perform matchmaking.
[235:39.72]Okay.
[235:42.08]Do I have to reset the game?
[235:49.79]I wonder if it worked.
[235:55.44]We'll do, like, a few more.
[235:57.68]Five to ten more.
[236:00.94]Bought you.
[236:02.54]Okay.
[236:04.24]Should we go against... Should we go against Jeremy Elbertson with the... Let's go.
[236:20.31]Is it wearing the same armor that I am?
[236:28.20]Clone fight.
[236:34.60]Is this the real Jeremy Elbertson?
[236:36.14]I don't know.
[236:40.75]Alright.
[236:41.87]Just going for it.
[236:42.49]You get the big shield.
[236:43.23]I think that shoots fire.
[236:44.51]I know that for a fact.
[236:51.39]Walk forward with it.
[237:00.33]Oh, I got through the shield.
[237:10.02]Oh, you have no idea how badly I want to backstab.
[237:19.79]He's just running.
[237:26.49]Get over here.
[237:34.52]Why is it Charlie Brown?
[237:35.54]Does a Charlie Brown yell in this game?
[237:43.63]I've never heard that before.
[237:50.15]Oh, it's already on.
[237:50.67]Okay.
[237:52.87]Faced Buffalo.
[237:54.13]Another bow user.
[237:58.91]Bows are cool.
[237:59.61]Hold on.
[237:59.79]What else we got?
[238:02.34]Faced Buffalo.
[238:05.32]I think so.
[238:05.96]Let's try it.
[238:09.97]I didn't guess the bow is fun.
[238:30.09]Nobody's using the black bow for some reason.
[238:32.30]Uh, SL means soul level.
[238:33.76]I know it's probably wrong for Elden Ring, but... Okay.
[238:41.06]I need to put that on my bar too, right?
[238:42.66]Like, let me just say hello.
[238:43.34]Okay, here we go.
[238:47.66]Holy shit.
[239:06.64]Ooh!
[239:19.75]Close!
[239:22.05]Oh, going for chip damage.
[239:23.09]That's what it is.
[239:24.89]Good fight.
[239:26.51]Good fight.
[239:37.47]One of those arrows kills me.
[239:39.13]So, good fight.
[239:50.08]Sure.
[239:53.10]Ten of them would, really.
[239:54.64]Did those not do that much damage?
[239:55.94]I wasn't really paying that much attention.
[239:56.91]I was trying to see how much they hurt for.
[240:02.99]That was an interesting build, though.
[240:05.25]How do you build a character to be able to use a great sword and a bow effectively at the same time?
[240:10.56]Just quality?
[240:11.72]How does that work?
[240:16.26]Your character's ugly?
[240:16.98]How do you just take damage?
[240:31.28]I like that one.
[240:33.59]Let's get to it.
[240:36.59]you're moving around kind of weird I don't know I don't like how weird you're moving around I don't like how weird you're moving around I don't like this where is this person okay um oh no don't drink alright but seriously though like what's even happening
[241:05.07]The guy was connecting from the moon.
[241:15.33]Cross region at Omega Lull.
[241:17.35]Cross- I know, but whatever.
[241:19.39]It don't matter.
[241:19.97]I like your name, Birdbrain.
[241:26.80]Oh, come on.
[241:27.76]What the fuck?!
[241:29.34]Why?! !
[241:34.98]Why do I keep crashing?
[241:47.61]That's not the multiplayer.
[241:49.29]That's just the game.
[241:49.97]I think your hard drive is all... No, my hard drive is not all, like, bunged up, alright?
[241:57.34]It's fine.
[242:05.07]It's a virus.
[242:05.91]They're sending it to you through multiplayer.
[242:20.80]Crypto miner installed.
[242:35.66]Uh-huh, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[242:39.84]What's the password?
[242:42.60]Cheese doctor.
[242:44.46]Cheese doctor.
[242:48.08]This is a reminder from the Toontown National Bank that you still owe Chad a debt to play Toontown.
[242:57.43]Okay.
[242:59.43]I'm gonna say, okay, if this crashes again, I'm just gonna go do boss summons, because what the hell?
[243:16.34]What is this?
[243:20.31]Do I dare summon... Do I dare summon Hog Rider?
[243:41.60]That mask, that... Oh, yi yi yi.
[244:03.31]Torch.
[244:04.61]Interesting.
[244:07.97]Welcome to the game, Hog Rider.
[244:10.37]You're going to fight me with a torch.
[244:11.49]I feel like this is going to go... Oh my god.
[244:13.79]This is fucking weird.
[244:14.89]This is weird.
[244:19.05]Can you upgrade the torch?
[244:40.75]that was cool that was really good fight that was really cool that weapon was actually
[245:05.85]Can you actually play through the game with a torch?
[245:12.93]PvP in FromSoftware games is atrocious because of netcode.
[245:17.42]I mean, it actually really hasn't felt that bad tonight.
[245:20.20]It really hasn't.
[245:21.32]It's felt pretty good, actually.
[245:23.64]But, yeah, I mean, sometimes, yeah.
[245:27.96]I don't know.
[245:28.98]What is this?
[245:29.96]I don't know what that says.
[245:34.12]This person has, like, the bug stuff.
[245:36.60]Sorcery.
[245:38.51]Hello?
[245:40.69]Wait, hell?
[245:43.27]You can't say hell in FromSoftware games?
[245:45.63]Hell.
[245:47.48]Wow.
[245:50.98]There's no reason to take it seriously, but it's fun.
[245:55.86]It...
[245:57.48]okay do you think that FromSoftware pvp would be more interesting to you if you could not use any like outrageous weapon arts what if there were no weapon arts would you think it was if there were no weapon arts would it be better or would it be boring
[246:27.75]It would be boring.
[246:28.77]That's interesting.
[246:34.95]That's the fun part.
[246:39.92]But then, how come this, um... This game is... These games are so popular.
[246:43.90]Oh, we couldn't get you.
[246:44.58]Sorry.
[246:45.56]We tried to get you.
[246:47.72]Unknown none.
[246:49.55]Uh... Seems like this is going to be a tough fight.
[246:56.51]Sure.
[247:01.97]Um... How did Pv... Can you connect through a land and play Elden Ring?
[247:09.22]Like, is that possible?
[247:12.90]Did you even do that?
[247:13.58]No.
[247:17.37]No.
[247:20.83]But if you were on the same, okay, if you did no cross region, and you were playing from the same room, on the same kind of, like, US West or whatever, would it be fine?
[247:31.34]The same router?
[247:31.86]Let's get to it.
[247:35.36]Let's get to it.
[247:37.96]Here we go.
[247:39.04]All your clothes are off now.
[247:41.40]I don't know what this person's doing.
[247:42.60]They're freaking me out, though.
[247:44.04]They had a full costume on, now they're naked.
[248:03.63]Holy shit.
[248:09.81]Why did I almost kill you?
[248:19.50]Shit.
[248:19.78]Come on!
[248:28.72]What was with the naked?
[248:36.23]Was that to have more than... What was the... It was funny?
[248:41.57]It's a min-max build.
[248:46.13]They were trying to flex on you.
[248:48.07]It was an ego boost.
[248:53.68]Well, they almost did it, so.
[248:55.91]It's probably more of a reason.
[248:58.87]I think we already fought Shpee.
[249:02.77]Gravity plus fall guy.
[249:09.98]I'm interested.
[249:10.48]Does that mean you're just going to walk off the edge?
[249:21.55]Grandma hates to see you fans.
[249:23.59]Hey!
[249:24.27]What are you talking about?
[249:27.85]I'm cross-region right now.
[249:37.63]So what does gravity plus fall joke mean, I wonder? ...
[250:21.57]He was in his equipment menu?! !
[250:28.72]I don't think so.
[250:30.32]What do you mean?
[250:36.96]Wait.
[250:37.24]Was he in an equipment menu?
[250:40.51]Maybe he realized that he was like, oh, this guy's using this stupid ass bullshit.
[250:44.15]This guy's doing Reda's mastery?
[250:46.69]What a chump.
[250:47.23]Alright, well, I'm going to put a different weapon on.
[250:56.12]You beat him up before he could do the joke.
[250:59.04]I think there was ample time.
[251:04.18]There was time.
[251:13.64]Let him do the joke.
[251:16.45]I held Loretta's mastery for a long time, and then I fired it.
[251:18.99]That wasn't a bad fight.
[251:22.53]Whatever.
[251:22.85]He was in the equipment.
[251:23.57]I've done that before.
[251:27.06]Oh my god
[251:57.56]You're going to do it again, aren't you?
[252:02.14]Alright, I'm going to be ready.
[252:12.02]Is that a sheep?
[252:24.11]oh that hurt
[252:56.18]I didn't even know that move was in the game.
[252:58.00]That's crazy.
[253:03.22]Good fight.
[253:04.62]That was actually a pretty interesting build.
[253:11.76]So you drink a stamina flask.
[253:16.31]And you can just roll for like a minute.
[253:20.13]That's cool.
[253:20.73]Alright, shpee.
[253:25.96]Augustin.
[253:27.06]Augustine.
[253:27.82]Sure.
[253:35.53]It's a weapon art?
[253:36.25]For what weapon?
[253:54.12]Literally, roll.
[253:55.30]Sorry, I didn't want to talk because I didn't want to burp.
[253:57.76]Let's do it.
[254:10.17]What the hell?
[254:10.87]Why do they just blow up?
[254:22.04]Holy shit, that move is actually kind of ridiculous.
[254:31.91]Ooh, good move.
[254:44.18]That move's broken in PvP.
[254:49.22]You can't dodge it.
[254:50.53]It just glues to you.
[254:55.85]That was a good fight though.
[254:58.77]I don't think you can dodge that.
[255:00.67]Can you dodge these?
[255:05.92]That move is kind of broken.
[255:11.90]You have to roll it.
[255:12.64]You have to dodge it.
[255:15.62]Stars of Ruin are a better version.
[255:17.16]Let me see.
[255:23.82]Do I have Stars of Ruin?
[255:24.64]I don't.
[255:33.20]What about Founding Rain of Stars?
[255:35.92]These moves are useless.
[255:36.73]What the hell am I going to do with these?
[255:37.73]Let me try Founding Rain of Stars.
[255:39.81]I feel like that would be weird.
[255:42.49]And... What do I arc onto?
[255:44.93]Get rid of this.
[255:48.77]Let's do the Gravity Pull.
[255:51.63]From Sellen's questline, I guess.
[255:54.36]I wonder how this works.
[255:55.48]I feel like this is going to be really annoying to deal with.
[255:56.86]Alright, bird brain.
[255:59.18]My computer crashed when I tried to summon you last time.
[256:01.12]That's kind of scary.
[256:03.22]Bloody crow.
[256:03.90]Let's try it again.
[256:04.68]Bird brain, I hope you don't crash my computer again.
[256:06.44]Because I want to fight you.
[256:08.46]I really want to fight you.
[256:09.38]Don't crash my computer, please.
[256:11.87]Please.
[256:21.01]We're good.
[256:32.06]We're good.
[256:33.04]It would have happened by now.
[256:54.63]They probably crashed.
[256:59.99]Birdbrain, I'm really sorry.
[257:01.15]The world does not want us to play against each other in Elden Ring.
[257:06.08]Yeah.
[257:09.44]I'm sorry.
[257:10.00]I think you crashed.
[257:12.26]Our computers can't interact with each other.
[257:14.18]I might jump.
[257:15.98]Okay.
[257:20.91]Like off the balcony or... What does that mean?
[257:27.38]Who's this ghost guy that keeps running?
[257:29.04]I don't know, man.
[257:38.13]Okay.
[257:38.27]Alright, I might jump.
[257:48.42]You will jump.
[257:50.00]Hello!
[257:56.87]Sorry, I was AFK putting on a lip balm.
[258:15.63]Actually pretty good.
[258:16.41]It's a ton of denial.
[258:19.83]Bat roll, that's not good.
[258:22.99]Oh, shit.
[258:24.09]Oh, no, no.
[258:24.85]Bat roll.
[258:25.69]Must have been maybe an equipment issue.
[258:29.72]Damn.
[258:30.34]Go again.
[258:35.00]Go again.
[258:38.92]They only jump.
[258:42.24]Oh, I get it.
[258:44.44]Right.
[258:44.92]Okay.
[258:48.46]That makes sense now that I think about it.
[258:51.69]Okay.
[258:54.07]Uh, sure.
[258:54.47]Bloody crow.
[258:55.83]Are there audio issues?
[259:03.32]There shouldn't be.
[259:03.82]Maybe when the crash happened, it screwed up.
[259:06.86]Nice grip.
[259:16.22]It's okay.
[259:16.56]Okay.
[259:18.85]It's kind of a Disney movie comic relief character.
[259:25.88]Go.
[259:52.59]Ooh!
[259:52.85]Got into the magic rain!
[259:58.84]Ooh!
[260:00.26]Holy shit, what just happened?
[260:01.52]I just exploded.
[260:04.22]Holy... Whoa.
[260:05.62]I just exploded?
[260:12.23]You're a little late on the snap, though.
[260:15.31]You were a little late.
[260:20.02]I was already disappeared.
[260:21.36]You had to get it after this last hit.
[260:23.78]Boom.
[260:25.12]Because otherwise, I'm already gone.
[260:28.98]That was a really cool move, though.
[260:35.61]No, good game, good game.
[260:42.91]Who's next?
[260:53.02]I was the other guys.
[260:59.36]Contextually, I don't know what that means.
[261:00.78]I was the other guy.
[261:07.41]Who else?
[261:10.25]From the top rope.
[261:18.96]He's got the Joker makeup on.
[261:23.80]Perfect.
[261:31.95]Founding Rain of Stars is actually really good.
[261:35.75]It's just irritating.
[261:44.55]Put on your... No?
[261:49.06]I feel like this is a talent show.
[261:50.78]Alright, what do you got for us?
[262:00.37]Let's do it.
[262:31.86]Hit!
[262:32.26]Swing!
[262:37.39]He's gonna hit you.
[262:54.90]That move is absolutely broken in PvP.
[262:56.56]That's the new meta.
[262:57.46]That thing is undodgeable.
[263:04.29]It happens so fast.
[263:05.17]Dodging that is... I mean, maybe it's just weird.
[263:22.45]To the next person I summon, I apologize.
[263:23.89]I'm going to be a total asshole.
[263:25.29]I just need to experiment.
[263:28.14]So, I'm really sorry whoever this is.
[263:29.96]Alright, I was the other guy.
[263:31.38]Sure.
[263:31.58]Fine.
[263:32.04]I'll just let you know that I'm going to be a total dick here.
[263:36.80]I'm just curious how this works.
[263:38.27]I mean, if you can beat me with this, I mean, then... While I do the kind of annoying cheese experiment.
[263:47.23]I could dodge it.
[263:49.45]VRJosh, where's your sign?
[263:54.94]That's it.
[263:58.52]We are just... Let's go.
[264:04.57]It hasn't shown up at all.
[264:06.09]I could give you a password.
[264:10.01]Alright.
[264:10.91]I was the other guy.
[264:11.77]Here's the... Why are you doing that?
[264:15.63]Why can you interact with that?
[264:16.96]I don't understand.
[264:18.50]Why did you pull this?
[264:19.88]What was the point of that?
[264:23.50]You can interact with stuff in my world?
[264:27.95]Alright, here we go.
[264:28.41]Ready?
[264:28.63]Good luck.
[264:42.38]Dude, this is... I mean, honest to god, that's so horrible.
[265:09.68]That really is annoying.
[265:11.04]Especially in the very beginning.
[265:12.28]This is too active with non-viewers.
[265:19.23]Actually, really good try, though.
[265:20.35]That's really irritating.
[265:22.17]Yeah, you know what?
[265:22.81]That's a really good point.
[265:23.81]We should go somewhere else.
[265:25.13]So we don't mess up other people's thing going on here.
[265:28.78]That's a good point.
[265:29.20]Alright, what's a place that, like, nobody would be, but that's not bad to fight in?
[265:41.85]Go to a secret spot?
[265:43.97]Yeah, we'll go to, um... Go to the... Maliketh area?
[265:51.63]No, there's a lot of people there.
[265:56.19]Lake of Rat?
[265:57.37]Underground area?
[266:04.29]This might be annoying to get back to.
[266:10.48]Volcano Manor is good.
[266:11.48]Yeah, let's do... What about, like, right out here?
[266:28.93]This isn't a ba- I mean, it's kind of an- there's a lot of like embers floating around, but... Nah, that's too much.
[266:34.84]We need our- we need gamer.
[266:35.68]We need to be able to see things.
[266:38.34]Turtle church?
[266:38.96]That's a good place.
[266:41.82]Yeah, that's a good one.
[266:44.92]Like right here.
[266:50.09]Yeah, pa- all the info is in the bottom right.
[266:51.39]Like right here?
[266:56.69]Or inside the church?
[267:01.93]Right here?
[267:03.99]I don't want to accidentally kill the turtle.
[267:10.05]You guys are going to make me founding rain of stars on the turtle and he's going to die.
[267:13.57]Alright, right here is good.
[267:16.47]Seems pretty open.
[267:19.44]Yeah, I'd say right here.
[267:20.04]Uh... Probably Josh.
[267:26.50]Get a password, Josh.
[267:27.12]I'm very curious.
[267:46.51]Alright.
[267:47.25]I don't want to show you guys the password, though, so you guys can't see this.
[267:55.72]Okay.
[268:06.38]So there's multiplayer password, and then there's group password.
[268:09.89]Can I... Should I just change them both or keep one?
[268:12.73]How does it work?
[268:23.60]Is it just... Okay.
[268:24.26]Alright, new password is... Almost set.
[268:34.28]Josh, you understand that the last letter can't fit, so just do... Just write it out with no last letter.
[268:40.53]Alright, let's go.
[268:50.49]Josh, what are you playing as?
[268:58.29]I don't know why I thought that was you.
[269:02.13]VRJosh is one of the mods.
[269:05.47]Okay.
[269:11.95]Looking for the sign.
[269:20.35]No?
[269:23.01]Where'd you put your sign?
[269:24.57]There it is.
[269:28.08]You're one of these puke barf people?
[269:33.91]Alright.
[269:37.11]You're one of the puke people.
[269:42.48]Let's go.
[270:00.66]You look so sad.
[270:01.70]Let me get a good look at you.
[270:04.24]You're the... Why are you so small?
[270:14.67]Is this weird, or are you... Okay, no, that was weird.
[270:17.13]I was like, why am I so much taller than you?
[270:25.35]Alright, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
[270:29.23]I don't know.
[270:29.89]That was a weird face.
[270:31.13]No, Drake!
[270:32.13]That was not part of it!
[270:33.57]That was not part of it.
[270:34.23]Wait, hold on.
[270:34.81]We're not doing it yet.
[270:36.67]Just, um... Alright, we're doing it.
[270:38.28]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[270:43.36]Wait, let me get the poison.
[270:44.04]Wait until the poison runs out.
[270:49.56]Oh, who cares about poison?
[270:50.32]Let's go.
[270:50.68]Oh!
[270:59.70]I went... Alright.
[271:08.41]E-mod him.
[271:08.89]E-modded.
[271:09.21]E-mod him.
[271:28.04]Alright, this one's for real.
[271:28.96]This one's for real.
[271:30.24]This one's the real one.
[271:35.76]This one's for real.
[271:36.54]For real.
[271:36.78]For real.
[271:37.30]Let's do it.
[271:37.70]For real.
[271:37.96]Is that it right there?
[271:49.49]Uh, not here.
[271:50.33]Where is it?
[271:54.35]You should refund that.
[271:56.49]I mean, that was a fight, but that wasn't a real fight.
[271:58.83]Now this is actually going to be the real one.
[272:03.33]Ah, sometimes it takes a second.
[272:12.96]No refunds?
[272:13.80]I mean, you bet.
[272:16.51]You did bet.
[272:25.69]Where's your sign?
[272:26.57]Come on, where is it?
[272:32.26]Where is it?
[272:32.62]I don't know why I can't see the sign.
[272:40.70]I turned it off?
[272:42.52]Oh, shit.
[272:42.96]Okay.
[272:45.10]Is that it right there?
[272:49.66]Yeah.
[272:50.90]Alright, this one's for real.
[272:51.90]Do whatever you want, buff-wise.
[272:53.14]If you want to buff up, get ready.
[272:56.09]This is the real one.
[272:56.81]If you want to bet, by the way, you can.
[272:58.05]Do anything you want.
[273:13.31]But before we do anything, there is an asshole over here that has to... There's like... I'm not going to attack you, but look.
[273:18.77]There's like this weird shit going on here.
[273:20.31]Let me take care of this.
[273:26.70]Alright.
[273:26.98]Go.
[273:30.62]Go.
[273:48.39]Ugh!
[274:15.63]Watch the stamina.
[274:34.88]Oh, environmental problems!
[274:37.98]Oh my fucking god, don't be an idiot.
[274:42.31]No!
[274:55.46]Oh!
[274:57.16]That was close.
[274:59.60]What is this build?
[275:00.42]You've got frost, poison, and rot?
[275:04.55]Or blood?
[275:05.11]That was insane.
[275:14.19]That's actually a really cool build.
[275:15.15]Alright, two out of three.
[275:18.50]That's two out of three, Josh.
[275:19.20]You know how it works.
[275:23.47]That counts as one.
[275:45.50]Yeah, it's a really cool build.
[275:47.42]Oh my gosh.
[275:54.46]No!
[275:55.48]VRJosh, why did you hack me?
[276:06.73]Oh, my whole computer might be going down here.
[276:13.95]Same spot.
[276:14.27]I'll be right back.
[276:18.64]Man, it really does not like the multiplayer, huh?
[276:26.62]That's like the third, fourth crash of the night.
[276:29.42]All from multiplayer.
[276:39.65]I somehow got sent to your world, too.
[276:44.33]Well, don't mess anything up.
[276:46.53]Don't take my peaches.
[276:48.47]Don't dig holes everywhere.
[276:49.57]Oh no, get out of there.
[276:54.15]No, get out of there.
[276:54.59]I don't want you there.
[276:55.31]Get out.
[277:09.88]Okay.
[277:15.56]Yeah, I mean, other mods in that... I put it in the mod chat.
[277:19.08]Other... I mean, if any of the mods are watching and you want to just... I can summon you.
[277:32.05]Just give me a second.
[277:40.09]I can put it in the other chat, too.
[277:51.84]Need to watermark the stream already.
[277:54.82]Yeah, but I mean, it's like I'm... I will.
[277:58.39]I promise.
[278:01.19]So we're still best two out of three.
[278:03.61]See if we can get this worked.
[278:11.73]There is currently a new password while I... I've got a little thing going on here with VRJosh.
[278:18.95]There is a paragraph over here in mod chat from VRJosh.
[278:21.49]Like, he's just fucking pissed.
[278:24.47]There's a ton of spelling errors.
[278:25.58]It's like three paragraphs talking about my build is like shit and then like a fucking lazy meme build or something.
[278:30.72]That's a lot of words here, man.
[278:53.50]Alright, so a different approach this time.
[279:00.54]That's a Fortnite emote, right?
[279:01.71]It looks like it.
[279:02.21]Here we go.
[279:04.43]Luck.

[285:14.58]Oh, loser sleeps on the couch.
[285:16.38]Oh my fucking god.
[285:19.32]That's so fucking stupid.

[285:43.13]Losers asleep in the dog bed.
[285:58.54]Let's go.
[285:59.36]This one's just for fun.
[286:12.92]Are bleed builds allowed?
[286:14.42]Yeah, anything's allowed.
[286:22.22]This is VRJosh, by the way.
[286:23.66]This is not Holly.
[286:34.23]Holy shit, that's fast.
[286:41.15]Holy shit.
[286:44.03]Oh, there's no more magical power in that thing.
[286:59.14]Here's the thing.
[287:00.30]I think Polly's actually going to kick the shit out of me.
[287:05.52]We'll see.
[287:06.48]We'll see.
[287:09.50]Sorry, I was trying new weapons.
[287:11.94]I love that when they just kind of go like, I don't understand why does it not work?
[287:16.12]I'm moving.
[287:16.85]I'm twisting with my arm.
[287:18.01]You bet on me?
[287:24.61]This is just for fun.
[287:29.93]Do not throw.
[287:30.59]I'm not going to throw.
[287:31.27]Yeah, you can use anything.
[287:40.78]Here's the thing, though.
[287:41.40]I've been a big fan of watching Holly play through this game.
[287:46.14]Seen a lot of her play through.
[287:48.60]I know all of her moves.
[287:55.11]I know all the moves.
[288:03.25]Are these us?
[288:07.71]I think, no, these are the people that's playing here.
[288:08.95]Okay.
[288:15.11]Alright, do I need to use the thing again?
[288:18.12]Maybe reload?
[288:21.96]Go against Dr. Schmoikson.
[288:24.56]Uh, there... Dr. Schmoikson.
[288:28.13]Did you put it down?
[288:30.31]Oh, sorry.
[288:33.07]I know, I didn't do it until before this stream either.
[288:36.20]One sec.
[289:51.30]Okay, yeah.
[289:51.90]It's kind of confusing before you do it, babe.
[289:53.54]When I never did it for the first time, I was like, what the fuck do I even do?
[289:57.12]He's recharging?
[289:58.06]What do you think I'm like, what do you think that means?
[290:00.42]You think I'm like going, doing like drugs?
[290:15.51]Oh, band name.
[290:17.49]Band name.
[290:26.29]Let's go.
[290:28.97]I'm going for it.
[290:33.60]The fucking game crashed!
[290:35.02]God damn it!
[290:41.47]Alright, let's try it again.
[290:45.41]Why does this game hate being online?
[290:54.68]I just want to play Elden Ring multiplayer.
[290:58.80]Why does this hate, why does it hate me so much?
[291:04.16]Oh no, you just got hacked.
[291:05.06]Imagine I summoned Holly in, and she just fucking started floating around and doing the exploding thing.
[291:12.90]You're like, what the fuck?
[291:18.42]Alright, we're gonna go for it again.
[291:21.37]After this, you can summon me to fight some bosses and then I'll turn the stream off.
[291:25.04]Whatever.
[291:34.30]I swear I have a girlfriend.
[291:35.34]My game just crashed.
[291:36.42]Haha.
[291:42.34]That's actually really funny.
[291:49.02]I have to prove it?
[291:49.80]Okay.
[291:53.79]Okay.
[291:55.01]Same thing.
[291:56.93]That was weird.
[291:57.33]That happened after I accepted it.
[291:59.37]That was weird.
[292:01.41]Oh, wait.
[292:04.16]You guys are going to be able to see the password if I do that again.
[292:07.58]Wait, look.
[292:22.48]Alright, here we go.
[292:24.34]Now don't crash.
[292:30.14]Alright, you ready?
[292:32.80]I bet on Jerma, but I hope Holly kills you.
[292:39.73]Let me know when I can stop covering my eyes.
[292:46.09]I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[292:50.60]Okay, so how this works is we bow first.
[292:53.70]Okay, bow.
[293:01.68]Ready?
[293:01.92]Okay.
[293:18.84]Oh, shit!
[293:23.50]Okay.
[293:24.28]Alright, alright.
[293:24.88]You got dragon moves, right.
[293:35.89]What's that?
[293:36.29]Okay.
[293:59.91]Oh!
[294:00.11]I'm out of stamina.
[294:00.81]Alright, I gotta get stamina.
[294:05.97]Hold on.
[294:14.86]Oh!
[294:17.42]Come here!
[294:23.05]Good first fight.
[294:24.01]Good first fight.
[294:26.71]You're cheesing your own girlfriend.
[294:30.31]I'm trying to win.
[294:32.01]Okay?
[294:34.25]I'm trying.
[294:34.81]I'm trying to win.
[294:40.76]I'm cheesing.
[294:42.46]Is this not a cheese move?
[294:44.10]Alright, again.
[294:47.68]Let's do it again.
[294:48.08]That was fun.
[294:55.55]That, okay, the dragon hand.
[295:00.59]That does a lot of damage.
[295:08.14]I thought the bet was for Black Ops 3?
[295:14.16]What are you talking about?
[295:15.79]Okay, alright.
[295:18.25]I'll put it down again.
[295:18.81]Let's do it again.
[295:33.00]This isn't rust.
[295:35.00]Careful dude, you're going to end up maidenless.
[295:50.92]You're beautiful.
[296:10.97]Get that out of here.
[296:11.55]Get that out of here.
[296:16.68]Oh, that's bad.
[296:23.94]Alright.
[296:24.28]That was alright.
[296:25.40]Alright.
[296:25.74]Alright.
[296:26.18]Alright.
[296:26.74]Alright.
[296:27.44]Alright.
[296:28.48]Alright.
[296:30.56]Okay.
[296:31.24]Okay.
[296:32.62]This is the one.
[296:47.73]She kicked your ass.
[296:50.29]Yeah.
[296:54.99]What she doesn't know is... I mean, she's literally right there.
[296:58.48]So she can... Of course she knows.
[296:59.82]She's literally going to hear me say it.
[297:01.08]I don't know if she's going to be able to handle the founding rain of stars.
[297:04.36]It's going to be tricky.
[297:09.98]Alright, this is the one.
[297:17.69]Do I need to do this again?
[297:19.04]Oh, the password's already leaked.
[297:21.56]Password's leaked.
[297:22.52]This is the last one.
[297:26.16]Good.
[297:29.64]Yeah, the password was yummy food, but you can't put a D at the end.
[297:41.51]That face when no gamer girlfriend who beat my ass in Elden Ring PvP said...
[298:03.54]Alright, you ready?
[298:04.26]Let's go.
[298:12.77]Alright.
[298:13.75]Smart.
[298:14.95]Holy, that does a lot of damage.
[298:16.11]Don't use all your stamina, sweetheart!
[298:19.15]Don't use all your stamina!
[298:38.23]That doesn't count.
[298:38.97]That doesn't count.
[298:44.85]What the fuck?
[298:46.05]This doesn't count.
[298:50.20]We gotta get rid of these people.
[298:54.14]Okay, I'm gonna heal and then take me down.
[298:56.18]Alright, hit me once.
[298:57.04]Okay, hit me one time.
[299:02.03]That's not fair.
[299:08.21]Take me down to where I was.
[299:09.27]Where was I before?
[299:10.75]Okay.
[299:14.29]Let's just heal.
[299:14.73]Just heal the fallout.
[299:15.79]Heal the fallout.
[299:16.41]Let's start it.
[299:30.37]Go.
[299:53.47]Oh, that's it?
[299:55.45]I missed.
[299:56.43]Oh my god, I missed!
[300:06.71]It's alright.
[300:11.03]It's alright.
[300:11.53]It's alright.
[300:12.40]That was a good fight.
[300:13.18]Good fight.
[300:20.04]Good fight.
[300:20.36]That was a good fight.
[300:26.76]You cheesed and still lost.
[300:28.76]Look.
[300:30.35]I thought she was going to do the lightning move again.
[300:34.57]I thought she was going to do the... I was afraid of it.
[300:40.50]Good fight, good fight.
[300:43.78]Alright, alright, alright.
[300:47.58]That was really fun.
[300:52.06]The Dragon Claw does so much damage.
[300:53.66]That's a really good move.
[300:56.73]Is anybody else in the mods or community leaders or anything?
[301:02.87]Want to give it a go?
[301:12.86]Maybe?

[301:44.82]free sentinel got it where is it like right here there's a level cap oh I'm sorry I don't think it can't work I'm sorry that you're having trouble with the Tree Sentinel
[302:13.36]Where can I go?
[302:14.38]Not with a password.
[302:17.00]Wait, really?
[302:20.27]Alright, put it down.
[302:21.53]Let's do it.
[302:23.11]The password is, you saw it already, but yummyfood with no D. It will work.
[302:32.04]Let's do it.
[302:38.40]Where do you want to put it?
[302:46.53]Y-U-M... Oh, the password, right.

[303:04.62]Password, yummyfoodwithnod.
[303:10.10]Okay, so who needs help?
[303:10.80]Put it down on your sign.
[303:12.79]Oh, okay.
[303:13.09]But, wait.
[303:14.01]Wait.
[303:16.27]If I put my sign down here, aren't there like 15,000 people that can just click it?
[303:19.76]How the hell is this gonna work?
[303:31.16]Okay, well... I need a private password.
[303:39.79]Okay, well, I mean, why would... I'm gonna put my... I'm gonna put it down here.
[303:49.91]Okay.

[303:58.55]There it is.
[304:03.77]Right down here.
[304:07.09]I think you need their password.
[304:12.86]And that's not a bad idea.
[304:19.04]I don't even know what that person's name was.
[304:23.47]You can only be summoned by people with the boss still alive in the area.
[304:27.39]Oh, okay.
[304:31.27]I think it was me.
[304:31.99]Alright, yeah.
[304:34.05]Or Zappy.
[304:35.13]I'm standing right here.
[304:38.02]My sign is right there.
[304:39.62]Let me go kick that Tree Sentinel's ass for you.
[304:49.86]Let me go take care of it.
[304:58.46]I'll take care of it.
[305:02.62]I don't see the sign.
[305:03.52]Do you have the password on?
[305:04.72]Alright.
[305:05.42]Of course, Abby.
[305:05.84]This is very important.
[305:06.94]You're going to go into multiplayer.
[305:09.85]You're going to go over to over here.
[305:11.35]Multiply password.
[305:13.57]It says... Multiply password.
[305:15.21]You're going to put YummyFu right there at the top.
[305:20.22]Have you been using PlayStation?
[305:22.04]Alright, you got it?
[305:24.52]I think you got it.
[305:33.13]That's not me.
[305:36.23]Oh, great.
[305:39.25]Okay.
[305:44.12]Bubble pop?
[305:48.59]Bro, you already burnt the urn tree.
[305:50.15]What even is here?
[305:57.14]I'm supposed to be helping somebody.
[305:58.86]What do you want me to help you do?
[306:02.94]Where are we?
[306:03.92]You lead the way.
[306:04.89]You lead the way.
[306:05.57]Where are we going?
[306:08.67]I'm following you.
[306:14.73]We got invaded.
[306:25.15]Alright, well, uh, good luck.
[306:30.80]Why does that make the inception sound?
[306:34.80]Holy shit, that's not fair!
[306:38.16]What the fuck?!
[306:40.04]What the hell was that?!
[306:41.60]That was insane!
[306:47.29]What?! !
[306:51.11]Alright, where's Core Zapper?
[306:53.11]I want to help you beat this boss.
[307:02.74]That was ridiculous.
[307:03.66]That guy drank like five potions and then killed us instantly.
[307:07.00]Alright, Core Zapper.
[307:08.70]Okay.
[307:09.98]Core Zapper, don't tell anybody.
[307:11.32]This is just for you.
[307:13.54]Over the map.
[307:15.00]This tree right here.
[307:18.07]No.
[307:18.59]Right?
[307:18.91]Yeah.
[307:19.55]That tree right there, Core Zapper.
[307:23.01]Right there.
[307:25.11]What I want you to do is I need you to do this for me.
[307:28.92]You could not do crossplay.
[307:31.02]What?
[307:32.32]Oh, you're not on PC.
[307:36.58]Oh, that's too bad.
[307:38.24]You're not on PC.
[307:41.41]You are on PC.
[307:42.23]Okay, well then.
[307:43.77]Core Zapper, we're good.
[307:45.62]Alright, what I want you to do, for Zafra, go into your multiplayer inventory.
[307:51.20]And you go into this fur-calling finger remedy.
[307:54.52]You need to use this.
[307:56.84]It'll do like a ding, and then that will let you see summoning signs on the ground.
[308:02.74]I'm going to put one, it might take a second or two.
[308:04.54]Get a password from him.
[308:08.92]Okay, alright.
[308:09.50]Yeah.
[308:09.90]Alright, can one of the mods DM CoreZapper or CoreZappy and get a password so I can put it in here?
[308:19.05]Why are you talking to him like you're tech support?
[308:23.62]I'm just trying to help.
[308:27.58]And in the mod chat, what's the password?
[308:32.08]Help me with Godfrey?
[308:38.58]Make a group password?
[308:39.46]Yeah, I gotta get in touch with them.
[308:44.61]Yeah, CoreZapper, we're gonna get you in touch with a mod.
[308:48.41]By the way, CoreZapper, I'll beat the whole game for you.
[308:50.95]Let's just go boss by boss.
[308:57.35]Imagine if this went boss by boss by boss.
[308:59.79]What's... Core... Am I saying your name wrong?
[309:04.17]C-O-R-Z... What is it?
[309:08.63]Say something in the chat.
[309:13.46]Oh, it's in the mod chat.
[309:15.60]Okay.
[309:15.92]Alright.
[309:17.50]Okay.
[309:18.40]I got the password.
[309:19.10]Don't tell anybody that password, CoreZapper.
[309:21.34]Don't tell anybody.
[309:22.70]That's just for you and me to have.
[309:23.70]Okay.
[309:39.74]See if I can see it on the ground.
[309:44.48]So now I'm... No, no, no.
[309:45.44]Okay.
[309:45.74]Now I'm going to put mine down right here.
[309:51.39]You should be looking for... It looks just like this.
[309:53.35]You're going to go over to it.
[309:54.43]You're going to click it.
[309:55.95]Summon me to my world.
[309:56.91]I'll be standing there.
[309:59.01]And then I will go and I'm going to destroy the tree center for you.
[310:07.90]I didn't leak it.
[310:08.44]What are you talking about?
[310:09.08]What do you mean leaked?
[310:09.78]This is it.
[310:30.25]Okay.
[310:34.66]Okay.
[310:37.67]Is this you?
[310:38.03]Alright, you ready?
[310:42.97]So what, you having trouble with this?
[310:43.99]Let me take care of this.
[310:46.16]Let me take care of this for you.
[310:57.22]Wait, why is the Tree Sentinel alive?
[311:02.40]The Tree Sentinel shouldn't be alive right now.
[311:05.19]Why did you need help doing this?
[311:07.71]You're just, you're destroying him.
[311:16.55]Oh, it's a new game.
[311:17.21]Okay, it's a new game.
[311:17.89]Plus, plus, plus.
[311:18.35]You're welcome.
[311:24.84]Dude, we just did that in tandem.
[311:26.16]That was awesome.
[311:26.94]That actually was really cool.
[311:28.34]I can't believe we just did that accidentally.
[311:32.46]That was cool.
[311:32.78]Alright.
[311:40.68]Who else needs help?
[311:44.77]Please help me with the Fire Giant.
[311:45.93]You got it.
[311:46.25]Uh, mods who have said that?
[311:53.61]Somebody said, please help me with the Fire Giant.
[312:07.28]We need to get a new password.
[312:08.12]I'm going to put it right outside the door.
[312:10.74]Where's the horse?
[312:18.29]Oh, right.
[312:21.43]I took all this off.
[312:22.03]Alright.
[312:32.46]I'm gonna put the sign directly out in front of the door, which is... I gotta go this way.
[312:36.22]Across the chain, right?
[312:37.06]Yeah.
[312:43.27]Yeah, somebody wanted help with Godrick, and I said I would do it.
[312:55.43]Oh, you know what?
[312:55.89]It seems like a lot of people need help with Fire Giant.
[312:58.01]So, I'm just going to put it right here.
[312:59.44]And the password... Um... Let's use... I mean, like a 12-piece McNugget or something.
[313:05.83]That's what the password was.
[313:25.24]It's right outside of the Fire Giant if you need it.
[313:26.84]It's gonna be hard not being able to get on the horse.
[313:38.21]Oh, whatever.
[313:51.39]Cam's blocking the password.
[313:52.91]Uh, it's 1-2, no spaces, 12-piece.
[314:00.41]Please help me with Godfrey.
[314:01.45]I've shat my pants six times.
[314:03.25]I'll go up there after this.
[314:19.08]Remember, you gotta use the item.
[314:20.80]You have to use this thing.
[314:21.62]There we go.
[314:32.64]Stuck on Millenia.
[314:33.84]I'm probably gonna make Millenia harder for you.
[314:35.45]Okay, this... Alright, female Jerma.
[314:47.11]Ready to do this?
[314:56.11]Jesus.
[314:56.43]Alright, let's get the fire, John.
[315:02.05]Alright, somebody invaded us, but we're in the door already, so they have to leave.
[315:08.75]Alright, let's go.
[315:10.81]Alright.
[315:32.97]I got so much health.
[316:02.07]Nice work, nice work.
[316:02.95]Keep it up.
[316:03.53]Bully.
[316:03.87]Gotta get the bully.
[316:32.13]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[316:39.49]No!
[316:40.51]No!
[316:41.55]Dude, I'm so sorry!
[316:43.37]Oh no!
[316:44.05]That was going so well.
[316:44.93]That was going so well.
[316:47.63]Oh, that's so sad.
[316:49.95]I hope you beat it.
[316:51.13]But now the boss has two times as much health.
[316:58.24]That's unfortunate.
[317:03.51]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[317:08.26]That was going so well, too.
[317:09.62]Alright, well, I don't know if you're still there, but... I'll put it back down.
[317:17.68]That's actually... Yeah, that's bad.
[317:22.32]Help me with the festival.
[317:23.14]I have not been able to reach that area.
[317:25.40]Somebody said this is probably what Superman felt like when he first got his powers.
[317:32.25]Superman, I need help!
[317:33.99]Come help me!
[317:34.89]Superman, you're gonna help me kill this person!
[317:37.36]Superman, help me kill this person!
[317:38.50]Well, Superman didn't kill any- Alright, that- Superman didn't kill anybody.
[317:42.40]It wasn't Superman helping people kill people.
[317:45.38]Superman, I really don't like this person.
[317:46.96]Could you, like, use those laser eyes and vaporize them?
[317:56.83]Summon signs back down.
[318:02.50]What about your PVE spells?
[318:03.92]I honestly... Oh, wait a minute.
[318:09.88]There we go.
[318:11.46]This is probably my best move that I have on this character.
[318:14.69]Besides Ice Crack.
[318:24.09]Please help, I'm stuck in the dryer.
[318:25.21]Okay.
[318:29.83]You are beautiful.
[318:32.08]You are now trans, Dremel.
[318:33.39]Okay.
[318:35.37]Let's go.
[318:36.41]You ready?
[318:36.73]Is this the same person?
[318:39.85]Are you guys ready?
[318:44.56]Don't invade anybody, please.
[318:54.99]Can you avoid this attack?
[319:01.39]I don't think I can... You can't avoid this, right?
[319:06.63]How do you avoid that?
[319:09.11]Jesus Christ.
[319:10.83]Lag, backlag, backlag, backlag, backlag.
[319:17.25]Good.
[319:22.31]Easy, easy, easy.
[319:23.03]Oh my god.
[319:24.33]I'm the one that had to watch it.
[319:49.22]I don't think I was even hitting them.
[319:54.76]Here we go.
[319:59.38]I don't know where you are.
[320:14.71]This is a bad place to be right now.
[320:16.66]I don't know.
[320:17.54]There's an edge.
[320:20.03]Nice work!
[320:24.09]There's the boss.
[320:24.79]Holy shit, okay.
[320:26.49]What the fuck?!
[320:28.12]Alright, you can handle it.
[320:28.76]You can handle it from here.
[320:29.46]You can handle it from here.
[320:31.24]I don't know why this keeps happening.
[320:37.54]Why does this keep happening?
[320:42.86]Does their game keep going?
[320:43.94]Because, I mean, you're at phase two.
[320:48.58]Are you talking with Commander Neil?
[320:52.96]Commander Neal.
[320:57.89]Maybe just find another... Yeah, I don't know what that... That's unfortunate.
[321:00.07]I'm sorry, everybody.
[321:02.51]We'll go, uh... We'll go somewhere else.
[321:05.59]I did say... Somebody wanted me to help with Godrick.
[321:07.19]Let me do that.
[321:09.61]I'm just accidentally griefing people.
[321:17.84]Fire Giant has notoriously shitty netcode.
[321:19.78]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[321:23.10]Alright, let me help this person with Godrick.
[321:36.09]I need help with Neil as well.
[321:38.87]Seems like a lot of people are having trouble with Neil.
[321:41.73]After Godrick, I'll come up to Neil.
[321:50.51]A Malenia is going to be tough because I feel like I'm going to make that harder for everybody.
[321:53.11]It's the anti-cheat that's wrecking havoc.
[322:01.94]They said Godfrey?
[322:03.35]No, somebody said Godrick.
[322:04.13]Somebody said Godfrey, but somebody said Godrick a long time ago.
[322:07.37]They've probably been sitting here waiting for it.
[322:11.90]How can I make that fight harder?
[322:13.77]When you get summoned, the boss gets more health.
[322:18.30]So, if you die... If I get killed by Water Dance...
[322:23.39]the first 15 seconds the boss does not reduce their HP they stay at like times two HP 50 yeah so if you go in if you let's say you play with your friend and you're both trying to kill uh Malenia really badly you summon your friend Malenia has 50 more HP your friend dies you're still in the game you just made it 50 harder for you what's the password 12 piece
[322:56.85]What?
[322:57.05]Why?
[322:57.29]What's going on here?
[323:04.20]Respect to the Raya NPC mod, use all power consumables and launch out the Comet Azura at every boss.
[323:14.72]That's actually true.
[323:15.96]Yeah, but that's kind of just like cheating, right?
[323:22.59]Oh, you can't walk into the... Okay.
[323:24.57]Can't walk into the boss room.
[323:28.86]12th piece.
[323:30.52]I'm going to Godfrey after this.
[323:58.35]There we go.
[323:59.96]Does nobody actually need this?
[324:15.31]If you're here and you need this to be done, multiplayer use a furl calling finger remedy.
[324:21.55]You should see my make sure your password is set.
[324:23.25]It's also in that menu up in the top right.
[324:24.78]Oh my god.
[324:32.73]Uh, it is the multiplayer password, not group password.
[324:37.69]You look like Albert Wesker.
[324:41.93]Seven minutes.
[324:51.87]Alright, I don't, I don't, is there nobody, I don't, whatever.
[325:02.98]Please help me with the Tree Sentinel.
[325:04.12]I'm level 9.
[325:07.34]Well, you just have to level up a little bit.
[325:14.31]Alright, summoning sign is going right here.
[325:16.91]People are saying I need help with Godrick.
[325:18.81]Not the shade one, this one.
[325:20.07]They're right here.
[325:29.04]I'm level 9.
[325:32.07]So you made a new character... ...and walked out the front door.
[325:39.43]That's so funny.
[325:50.22]Alright, Jesus.
[325:53.38]Hey!
[325:55.00]Hey!
[325:55.72]Hey, man!
[325:57.60]Yeah, it's me, Jesus Christ!
[326:06.61]Let's kick his ass Somebody invaded us?
[326:28.06]I thought you couldn't
[326:41.13]Who's doing that move?
[326:41.87]Is that you?
[326:42.37]Is that Jesus?
[326:57.74]Stop!
[326:58.16]Who's talking?
[327:00.36]We're gaming over here, man.
[327:11.89]I love this fight so much.
[327:12.92]It's so good.
[327:21.12]Ooh, stay alive!
[327:24.60]No!
[327:26.96]No!
[327:37.99]Just back off and heal.
[327:43.70]How can I not hit this guy?
[327:50.40]Dude, what the fuck is happening?
[327:52.32]I hope you can beat it because this- oh, this happens every single fucking time?
[327:56.68]Wait, they're a hacker?
[328:06.87]What do you mean?
[328:10.53]He wasn't taking damage?
[328:11.85]I was wondering what was with that spell?
[328:16.45]That spell was fucked!
[328:18.37]I was like, why have I not seen that spell?
[328:20.81]That was fucked!
[328:23.27]He wasn't taking damage.
[328:30.58]Okay, does anybody need help?
[328:32.42]Can we even complete one of these encounters?
[328:35.22]Or am I going to have to go back to invasions?
[328:45.05]He had speed?
[328:50.39]I'm like doing call-outs.
[328:52.90]And like, oh back it up!
[328:53.64]Heal it up!
[328:54.02]Heal it up!
[328:55.32]Got your back!
[328:57.00]Dodge it!
[328:57.28]Dodge it!
[328:57.56]This guy can't take damage and just rings are everywhere and he's just walking around.
[329:01.24]I need help getting to Godrick.
[329:10.61]I'm trying to run past the ballista.
[329:14.63]Actually, I can help with that.
[329:23.82]He was casting instantly.
[329:25.22]That was so weird.
[329:30.44]It's crazy how people use, like, the... Okay.
[329:34.42]People have, like, Diablo trainers.
[329:36.29]It's like, oh yeah, I got this character.
[329:39.85]Diablo, whatever.
[329:41.21]I can spam Frozen Orb a thousand times in a second.
[329:46.71]Anybody need this?
[329:55.69]I don't think anyone's doing it.
[330:01.74]That guy wasn't hacking, dude.
[330:02.80]That was actually Jesus.
[330:05.74]Oh, yeah.
[330:06.04]I didn't even think about that.
[330:08.92]Looks like nobody needs Godrick.
[330:13.39]Please, I need help on Soldier of Godrick.
[330:15.73]Okay.
[330:15.83]Okay.
[330:27.45]What about Elden Beast?
[330:45.01]If you need help with Soldier of Godrick, I got your back.
[330:58.06]Can I kill Soldier of Godrick in one hit?
[331:12.26]Okay, it's right here.
[331:17.82]This is where it usually is, right?
[331:21.20]No, no, it's after the...
[331:24.39]No, yeah, it's right there.
[331:25.75]Okay.
[331:27.57]A little bit further?
[331:28.16]Yeah, it's after the guard counter tutorial.
[331:49.59]What am I doing?
[331:50.35]This is so stupid.
[331:55.44]Can you even summon for this boss?
[331:57.16]I don't know.
[332:01.32]Is this it?
[332:05.11]No.
[332:06.23]What the fuck?
[332:21.26]I'll laugh my ass off.
[332:22.24]Okay, here it is.
[332:23.12]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if this person dies to Soldier of Godrick.
[332:28.52]Whoever you are.
[332:35.38]Where did I say I was gonna go?
[332:36.23]Where are we going?
[332:47.83]Elden Beast?
[332:49.61]I'll help with Elden Beast.
[332:51.99]Help me with Godfrey, please.
[332:53.17]I... Alright, I will... But, what the heck?
[333:03.16]I want to help... There's somebody that actually wanted help with Godfrey.
[333:08.14]If I get summoned into Jews, this is a game again.
[333:09.74]I'm jumping off the cliff.
[333:23.46]Okay, here it is.
[333:25.44]You really need help with Godfrey.
[333:43.22]Irma's going through so much trouble, all he wants to do is help a noob in need.
[333:47.80]Yeah!
[333:51.46]I don't know.
[333:51.92]These games are hard, and if there's some person that's just like, I don't get it, then I can get in there and I can just whoop some ass.
[333:59.44]Why not?
[334:08.83]Thank you.
[334:10.35]Ready to do this?
[334:11.61]Alright, just keep in mind that when the boss gets down to like 30% HP, I'm going to disconnect apparently.
[334:16.78]Oh, let's go.
[334:18.91]Hope you can handle it after it gets to that part.
[334:35.76]Okay.
[334:53.00]Oh, shit.
[334:54.50]Oh, shit!
[335:05.67]Get that front stab!
[335:07.43]Nice.
[335:08.61]We both did it at the same time.
[335:10.39]Does it count?
[335:29.92]Oh shit, I wasn't ready!
[335:31.34]Yikes!
[335:49.04]That's bad!
[335:49.62]That's bad!
[335:50.08]That's bad!
[335:50.48]I might die!
[336:11.56]It's alright, I disconnected.
[336:12.46]Panic rolled?
[336:22.81]I fucked up.
[336:25.27]I wasn't ready.
[336:27.50]I think you actually didn't help him.
[336:29.20]It's all level 53 by the way.
[336:33.36]Whatever, relax.
[336:43.27]They have two times more HP.
[336:44.39]But they're in phase two and they got like... Look, that was my mistake.
[336:46.99]It's alright.
[336:47.29]That guy definitely killed the boss.
[336:55.76]This... Absolutely beat it.
[337:03.64]Phase two is harder.
[337:05.67]Yeah, I just... I got caught.
[337:07.85]I got caught.
[337:09.17]That's what happened.
[337:11.91]Alright, Malden.
[337:12.35]You ready?
[337:13.33]Let's go kill Godfrey.
[337:20.56]Thank you.
[337:26.29]Let's do it.
[337:45.80]Did I not hit him one time?
[338:08.13]Shit.
[338:10.31]Oh my god, I'm fucking throwing.
[338:13.17]No, get out!
[338:41.16]Let's back it up and heal.
[338:47.40]I got it.
[339:05.57]I'm so sorry.
[339:06.87]Okay, we're good.
[339:09.42]We're good.
[339:09.74]We're good.
[339:10.02]We're good.
[339:10.54]We're good.
[339:22.23]I'm sorry!
[339:22.67]I'm alive.
[339:26.55]I'm dead.
[339:29.89]I just... I fucking can't.
[339:32.67]Oh my god.
[339:33.33]I like love this boss.
[339:34.77]You know what it is?
[339:35.90]Alright, here's what it's like.
[339:38.16]I'm not used to like just kind of being like in the room and and like not having aggro and just kind of running...
[339:48.95]It's weird.
[339:50.45]I feel like a summon.
[339:51.61]I am a summon.
[339:52.25]It's weird.
[339:54.17]Okay.
[339:56.23]I promise I'm not griefing viewers on purpose.
[340:00.27]Alright, alright, alright.
[340:01.52]I'm gonna... Okay.
[340:08.02]You know what?
[340:08.48]I'm just gonna help people kill bosses.
[340:12.62]What?
[340:12.74]What?
[340:21.61]I'm putting... Let's go.
[340:28.65]You respect.
[340:29.41]Oh yeah, that's right.
[340:30.25]I can still do it.
[340:33.74]A mimic tier is better than you.
[340:34.96]A mimic tier... I've never done this before.
[340:39.24]I've never done this.
[340:40.58]I'm trying.
[340:41.74]It's a different environment.
[340:42.82]It's a completely different... It's a different environment.
[340:45.67]It's like I'm there, but he's not fighting me.
[340:48.29]But he is sometimes.
[340:49.25]And I'm just like, alright.
[340:50.99]I'm not taking one point of fucking damage.
[340:59.75]Alright, Hamburger Helper.
[341:05.19]I promise I'm gonna... You're the one I'm gonna actually help.
[341:08.32]I'm not gonna be an anchor to anybody else.
[341:10.10]Let's go.
[341:13.30]Check this out.
[341:35.79]Thank you.
[341:59.40]Dude, it's fucking weird!
[342:01.02]It's weird to not get targeted, but then... I can't get a rhythm!
[342:27.99]I'm just like fucking running after the guy.
[342:56.12]Alright, let's go.
[343:01.94]No!
[343:07.42]I'm trying to help!
[343:13.92]Get away from me!
[343:20.56]Oh my god, he keeps suplexing you.
[343:29.74]Let me take aggro.
[343:30.32]Let me take aggro.
[343:31.00]Alright, heal up.
[343:41.68]You heal up.
[343:42.06]I got it.
[343:43.06]Alright, just a few more hits.
[343:56.28]You got it.
[343:56.58]You got it.
[343:56.82]You got it.
[343:58.39]Watch out!
[343:58.65]Back up!
[343:58.91]Back up!
[343:59.13]Back up!
[343:59.35]Back up!
[344:00.27]No!
[344:00.59]Let me kill him before you die!
[344:09.37]Oh, no.
[344:13.71]Oh, no.
[344:15.01]He was out of heals.
[344:19.52]Oh.
[344:24.28]I'm sorry.
[344:25.02]That was close.
[344:27.46]No, we'll get it.
[344:28.06]We'll get it.
[344:28.40]We'll get it.
[344:28.96]Come on.
[344:29.26]Let's do it.
[344:31.96]I'll take aggro.
[344:32.72]I was trying.
[344:33.10]I was trying to just get in there.
[344:37.02]I was trying to just get in the way so it'd just be annoying so then he could run away and cast spells.
[344:46.33]Use the aggro talisman?
[344:49.63]Oh, that's right.
[344:59.12]A Kratos?
[345:01.32]Let's try it.
[345:04.38]See if we can get it.
[345:05.56]I'm going to sneeze in one second here.
[345:11.61]Summoning another cooperator.
[345:12.97]Oh, we're going to do this with three people?
[345:16.67]I'm going to sneeze.
[345:25.77]Come on!
[345:29.69]Who's the- Oh, wait, that's a- Oh, he's dead!
[345:47.47]Oh no!
[345:48.51]Oh no!
[345:49.09]He got one hit!
[345:50.59]What happened?
[345:51.21]Oh no!
[345:56.08]Oh no, dude, I'm sorry.
[345:59.65]Oh, that's sad.
[346:00.47]I'm sorry.
[346:02.85]I promise we will kill one boss like this.
[346:06.22]I hope.
[346:15.35]Reallocate flasks?
[346:17.53]Oh, it cuts it in half.
[346:18.37]Okay.
[346:32.37]Who is it?
[346:35.75]Alright.
[346:37.51]This is a tough one.
[346:41.15]We got it.
[346:43.09]Let's go for it.
[346:44.47]We're gonna get this.
[346:50.45]Trust me when I say that we've got it in the bag right now.
[346:56.90]Here we go.
[347:03.58]You just sit back there and cast that shit, man.
[347:05.26]I got this.
[347:14.64]Just keep doing that shit.
[347:15.86]We got it.
[347:16.48]Oh, watch it.
[347:16.94]Oh, God.
[347:22.87]Oh, God.
[347:32.22]oh my god I'm dead oh my god I thought oh my goodness I thought I thought the stagger I thought I was gonna get staggered actually griefing I playing this game with two people against a boss it feels weird
[348:01.08]I'm trying to fight it, but my brain is like, no, I'm not fighting this.
[348:05.50]And sometimes he'll do a combo where he's like, one, two, and then he's like, you!
[348:09.72]And he just comes for you.
[348:12.30]Now you know what it feels like to be the boys.
[348:14.85]That's alright.
[348:19.29]Use your spells?
[348:19.95]I want to do Moonveil.
[348:30.15]How come you're griefing your fans?
[348:34.19]Alright, I gotta get in the zone here.
[348:36.90]I will beat a boss with someone.
[348:40.26]I will help somebody.
[348:41.56]I will actually, I promise.
[348:44.72]You're doing this for content.
[348:51.09]I mean, Ember Helper 2.
[348:58.02]Okay.
[348:59.13]Uh, we'll get it this time.
[349:02.39]We'll get it this time.
[349:07.19]Okay.
[349:41.94]What?
[349:45.67]How did that hit me?
[349:47.37]What the fuck are you talking about, game?
[349:49.91]What?
[349:57.15]Alright, let's get it.
[350:04.58]Ah!
[350:08.87]Nice!
[350:09.23]Nice!
[350:09.47]Get it!
[350:09.74]Double tap!
[350:17.06]Just kill him before he does it!
[350:18.88]Nice.
[350:22.40]Good work.
[350:24.75]Got it.
[350:26.15]See, we actually did one.
[350:29.27]We actually got to do at least- I got to at least help one person.
[350:32.11]Beautiful.
[350:37.68]Hooray.
[350:38.12]No, nice job.
[350:43.02]Actually helped this time.
[350:45.28]Please help me do mine again and don't die.
[350:46.88]I feel so bad.
[350:48.16]I actually feel bad.
[350:49.98]Alright, I'm gonna put it down again.
[350:53.89]Because there are people that need this.
[350:55.21]Help with Elden Beast?
[351:00.07]Ugh, I... I hate that boss.
[351:02.19]I'm probably gonna... I'm gonna be way worse.
[351:06.08]You do not want me to help you do Elden Beast.
[351:07.64]I'll rage and turn my stream off.
[351:22.11]Alright, Malden.
[351:24.41]Let's get it this time.
[351:25.17]Let's go for it.
[351:30.41]No, don't apologize.
[351:31.19]That's my fault.
[351:32.55]I'm making the boss have 50% more health than ditching you at phase 2.
[351:36.15]That's not you.
[351:37.61]That's me.
[351:44.78]Go for it.
[352:13.09]Oh shit, got him too close.
[352:37.24]Shit.
[352:51.81]Shit!
[352:54.15]Oh, he did it twice!
[352:55.11]Okay, we're good.
[353:08.77]It's alright.
[353:36.02]Oh, you gotta get out, get out, get out.
[353:37.36]Don't stay in.
[353:43.66]Oh, I'm dead.
[353:50.23]I'm dead.
[353:50.51]You got it.
[353:50.89]You got it.
[353:51.19]You got this.
[353:51.61]You got this.
[353:52.23]He's low.
[353:52.51]He's low.
[353:53.05]He's low.
[353:53.75]He's low.
[353:54.03]You got it right now.
[353:55.11]You got this.
[353:55.55]You can do it.
[353:58.01]Be careful.
[354:04.47]You're so close.
[354:05.31]You can do it.
[354:08.39]Bro, you had two heals?
[354:09.59]What?
[354:10.17]I had two... Alright, I gotta get these fucking mana flasks out of here, by the way.
[354:15.67]This is stupid!
[354:16.62]Alright, we need to confirm that he did it.
[354:28.24]Why do I have... Why do I have seven mana... Bro, I need one fucking mana flask.
[354:35.11]I need one.
[354:35.77]One.
[354:36.55]One.
[354:40.56]Did you get it?
[354:46.71]Confirmation.
[354:47.27]Did Malden beat the boss?
[354:59.82]He didn't.
[355:05.15]I need two or it'll be zero.
[355:06.47]Oh my god.
[355:08.55]You didn't beat the boss.
[355:10.03]Oh no, I'm so sorry.
[355:11.37]I... I come in here with three heals like an idiot.
[355:25.60]You did this.
[355:26.30]It's alright.
[355:26.74]We'll get it right here.
[355:40.85]We'll get it.
[355:41.35]We'll get it.
[355:41.67]The aggro talisman.
[355:53.16]I feel like that's going to be worse.
[355:55.36]We'll find out.
[355:58.74]This is a bad idea.
[356:09.23]We got it.
[356:11.39]This is the one.
[356:14.96]Yep.
[356:15.28]We also have Malden as well.
[356:16.28]By the way, I'm not even using this, so I need to put on... Hold on just a sec.
[356:26.51]Alright, let's go.
[356:30.57]Just in case I want to cast a spell for some reason.
[356:36.43]Let's do it.
[356:51.84]Keep on it.
[357:13.77]Billy.
[357:17.86]Oh my god, I died.
[357:48.03]No phase two?
[357:48.63]What the hell is going on?
[357:49.55]Alright.
[357:50.41]Let's go!
[357:55.04]Fuck you!
[358:12.10]Goddammit, I'm so bad at that part!
[358:44.65]Got it.
[358:45.07]Nice job.
[358:47.09]Nice work.
[358:51.57]A man of my word.
[358:57.52]Dual Moonvale.
[358:58.40]Yeah, that's all good.
[359:02.74]I gotta... Malden.
[359:03.86]I gotta take care of Malden.
[359:04.84]That was... Come on.
[359:12.41]When you tried to summon me, you crashed my game.
[359:15.01]This seems to be kind of a thing that happens, right?
[359:18.63]Alright, Malden.
[359:24.68]Let's go.
[359:24.96]Where you at?
[359:32.91]And then we'll go to Commander Neal after this.
[359:36.39]I gotta get this win from Alden, though.
[359:37.91]That's not cool.
[359:44.90]This is so fun.
[360:00.74]Got it on the ground here.
[360:02.91]Hopefully Malden didn't rage quit or something.
[360:05.93]That'd be sad.
[360:06.93]There we go.
[360:10.45]I've been doing nothing but co-op bosses since beating the game.
[360:13.99]It definitely feels a lot different.
[360:17.72]It's like when you have a summon out, but the summon's there the whole time.
[360:20.98]It's really cool.
[360:23.40]What are you... Yeah, we're doing DOS.
[360:27.44]This is different.
[360:28.42]This is a different player.
[360:31.38]Okay, Snaggletooth.
[360:34.70]Let's do it.
[360:42.29]Up with Elden Beast.
[360:45.45]We'll do, um... I want to do... A lot of people were talking about Nihil.
[360:48.51]Let's go.
[360:58.00]Far away.
[361:16.44]Look at this dagger!
[361:21.50]Come on!
[361:24.18]There it is.
[361:50.29]There's two incoming.
[361:55.63]There's two!
[361:56.21]Yeah, there we go.
[362:06.40]Got it.
[362:13.34]Bro, what happened?
[362:17.05]How did that happen?
[362:17.71]That was so weird.
[362:20.75]No animation continued and happened in phase two.
[362:33.01]Cause we caught it right.
[362:34.51]That's unfair.
[362:36.92]That's unfair.
[362:47.45]That was unfair.
[362:47.91]Alright, last, last attempt on whatever, on whoever gets it.
[362:55.50]Hopefully, uh, it would have to do with Malden.
[362:59.26]And then we're gonna go to Commander Neil.
[363:00.71]You look really greasy.
[363:01.73]I know.
[363:02.17]It's I am.
[363:03.95]You understand?
[363:04.39]Like, I am.
[363:05.29]Like, I'm a greasy fucking person.
[363:19.40]Okay, cool.
[363:20.50]Ugh.
[363:21.88]Stretch it out a little.
[363:26.90]I have somebody else.
[363:27.88]I apologize to people that I couldn't beat it.
[363:29.47]It's my bad.
[363:31.87]But hopefully we get this one.
[363:34.69]That's so, like, loud.
[363:44.40]Go.
[364:12.40]There's a stagger here.
[364:13.14]Can't see anything.
[364:18.95]Thanks for watching.
[364:53.24]Pulls it up, right?
[364:55.94]Come on, dude.
[364:57.42]Come on, win.
[365:14.43]No!
[365:19.83]Careful.
[365:24.77]Someone's dead.
[365:44.49]Oh boy.
[365:46.99]We gotta get him one more hit on him and he's dead.
[365:51.67]Alright, we're good.
[365:55.37]Nice job.
[366:05.66]Excellent work.
[366:07.44]Get it.
[366:13.30]This feels good.
[366:15.11]It doesn't feel good when you die in the first 10 seconds and you know that they have to just leave the room.
[366:21.86]Did Malden do it?
[366:22.64]I don't think so.
[366:26.02]Despite you being bad at the game and dying, I enjoyed coping with you.
[366:31.18]Malden, are you... Can we get a mod confirmation of Malden is still here?
[366:35.98]I tried helping Malden and I died.
[366:37.90]Oh no.
[366:42.00]Malden just can't... Malden can't catch a break.
[366:44.13]This is unfit.
[366:44.75]It sucks.
[366:46.47]Alright, Malden... Mods, can we get a private password for Malden, please?
[367:00.00]Yeah.
[367:01.46]Let's get a special password for Malden.
[367:05.06]Who is Malden?
[367:07.50]Uh, he's a player.
[367:11.79]And I lost twice.
[367:13.67]We got him down to one hit.
[367:15.69]That's too bad.
[367:20.00]We'll get it.
[367:20.32]I'll make sure Malden gets the win here.
[367:30.83]He's the main character.
[367:33.95]Hopefully Malden's here.
[367:34.75]Malden might not even actually be here.
[367:38.39]They might just be playing the game, not even watching the stream.
[367:41.63]Oh no, that's impossible because of the password.
[367:48.17]Anything?
[367:50.08]About 10 more seconds.
[367:52.10]And then we're going to go to Neil.
[367:57.14]Sorry, man.
[368:06.88]Alright.
[368:09.78]Okay.
[368:11.86]Let's go to Commander Neal.
[368:12.80]Where's Commander Neal?
[368:15.66]Here, right?
[368:17.28]Oh.
[368:19.12]Here.
[368:20.32]Oh, we got Malden.
[368:20.98]Alright.
[368:21.78]Yeah, we do have Malden.
[368:22.76]I need a special password for Malden.
[368:27.59]Under the multiplayer password.
[368:30.73]What do we got?
[368:46.24]I promise you that we will beat this.
[368:47.96]I'm not going to leave this seat until Horror Lou is dead.
[368:54.82]Just, we'll use this password.
[369:06.46]Okay.
[369:19.51]Okay.
[369:20.89]Password confirmed.
[369:21.55]You get the sign on the ground?
[369:34.46]No fucking around this time.
[369:35.50]I'm gonna go for it.
[369:36.06]I'm gonna win.
[369:55.36]I'm not doing Elden Beast.
[369:56.44]No way.
[369:59.06]Is the password McChicken?
[370:00.18]It is not.
[370:01.82]What else?
[370:06.95]Alright.
[370:07.25]Uh-uh.
[370:09.33]Malden is confirmed.
[370:11.41]Got the password.
[370:17.14]This time I have hailing flasks.
[370:32.44]Do I have the password right?
[370:33.40]Let me make sure I do.
[370:36.52]Yeah.
[370:38.78]Okay, there we go.
[370:39.50]Come on in.
[370:52.75]Order one McChicken every time you die.
[370:54.29]Actually, maybe I will get some McDonald's later.
[370:57.21]I don't know.
[371:01.59]Oh, dude, we gotta... We're going with the double here?
[371:07.76]Please help.
[371:08.62]Alright, well, then... We'll take care of you.
[371:15.17]And summon the actual summon at the door, too.
[371:17.47]So let's Mario Party this boss.
[371:27.76]I thought Josh was already here.
[371:34.30]Let's go.
[371:50.82]I can't even tell what's happening.
[371:54.08]I'm going to die.
[371:55.26]There's too much going on.
[372:02.01]God.
[372:02.41]Is that still going to land?
[372:23.97]Do it.
[372:25.47]Did I do it?
[372:26.25]Oh, no.
[372:26.67]It was Malden.
[372:27.17]Alright.
[372:27.37]We're good.
[372:34.37]We did it!
[372:36.03]We did it!
[372:37.51]Yes!
[372:40.24]Congratulations, Baldin.
[372:44.02]Good luck with the last part of the game.
[372:46.96]It sucks asshole.
[372:49.82]Have fun.
[372:59.05]Let's go to Commander Neal.
[373:04.97]I should go level up.
[373:05.76]Oh my god, I have a ton of souls.
[373:09.48]Yeah, let's do Neil.
[373:14.08]It's the best bonfire.
[373:25.35]Please help me with Mohg.
[373:26.23]There's a lot of people that want help.
[373:30.50]But here's the best part.
[373:32.22]Here's the best part.
[373:33.74]I can leave you guys
[373:36.72]That password?
[373:38.52]That password can stay.
[373:39.42]You guys can help each other, right?
[373:43.02]Just use that same password.
[373:45.88]Alright, this is the room.
[373:54.59]Alright, so it's done.
[373:55.07]Alright, whoever needed help with Commander Neil, I'm here.
[373:58.27]Right here.
[374:07.97]Neil or O'Neil?
[374:12.83]These people are idiots.
[374:13.90]Don't leave me.
[374:14.46]Alright, boogers just came out my nose.
[374:16.90]I think I'm ruined.
[374:21.22]Oh, the password.
[374:22.72]It is different.
[374:25.30]Password is no longer YoMaldon.
[374:28.58]It's now... We'll go back to Cheese Doctor.
[374:31.00]That's better.
[374:37.13]Same one we had at the very beginning.
[374:38.05]Alright.
[374:52.83]Let's do some commander now.
[374:57.37]Although, actually, I... No, it's fine.
[374:59.75]It's fine.
[375:11.62]Cheese doctor or cheese drive?
[375:13.08]I mean, it's supposed to be cheese doctor, but I couldn't fit anything else.
[375:25.87]If you're just joining the stream, I don't usually use the moon veil.
[375:30.23]It's a good helper weapon.
[376:47.73]Is nobody here?
[376:48.25]How have I not been summoned yet?
[377:16.10]Do a diagonal?
[377:18.13]How do I do that in OBS?
[377:18.81]Can I even- can I make it diagonal?
[377:40.58]Rewrite the summon sign.
[377:41.62]Oh shit.
[377:48.65]I want to make a diagonal.
[377:52.29]I don't think I can make a diagonal.
[377:54.50]Transform.
[377:55.08]Hold on.
[377:55.38]No, you can't.
[378:21.21]Make it smaller.
[378:21.85]Hold on.
[378:47.30]I gotta add one more thing.
[379:24.51]Oh, right.
[379:25.63]It's you!
[379:26.03]I should put, like, sounds in the background too, like... Okay, so where are we going from here?
[379:46.29]Oh fuck, the wrong weapons.
[379:59.24]Wrong weapons.
[380:01.89]That's so fucking annoying.
[380:02.85]I hate that.
[380:03.29]I don't want to do it anymore.
[380:29.27]Oh shit.
[380:43.80]Oh shit.
[380:57.30]There it is.
[381:07.95]Oof.
[381:09.73]Oof.
[381:09.81]I'm in the corner.
[381:16.53]Careful.
[381:17.00]Back it up.
[381:22.64]We got him!
[381:51.98]I forgot this is all on here.
[382:17.22]Subscriptions start at $14.99.
[382:19.42]What the fuck was that?
[382:20.38]That scared the shit out of me.
[382:22.54]Why didn't I play before?
[382:23.42]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[382:28.98]I don't know why I didn't play before.
[382:29.94]No, fuck that joke.
[382:36.69]I thought somebody hacked my game and was in my call.
[382:44.37]I actually thought that somebody was in a call, like hacked my computer or something.
[382:50.28]I know for a fact somebody else needed help with this, so... Why did it take so long?
[383:03.82]That was weird.
[383:11.57]Okay.
[383:13.97]I know there was another person that needed help with this badly, so come on.
[383:17.52]Let's do it.
[383:18.32]There we go.
[383:18.62]Can you help with Lord of Cinder?
[383:31.88]Shut up.
[383:33.19]Shut the fuck up.
[383:44.11]Oh, it's Pot Friend.
[383:45.17]Okay.
[383:46.45]Well, now I know why you need help with this.
[383:47.97]Because your character probably sucks.
[383:56.25]What the hell?
[383:59.05]What's going on?
[383:59.37]Why is my health so low?
[384:03.36]What's going on?
[384:09.40]What's going on?
[384:12.96]What's going on?
[384:15.46]Bro.
[384:20.64]I don't know what you want me to do, man.
[384:26.96]You're like level 15.
[384:28.18]Alright, let's do it again.
[384:39.71]That person was level 1.
[384:40.97]Oh my god, that's stupid.
[384:49.64]I was going to say that something was off about that one.
[385:03.73]Oh, Jesus again.
[385:04.99]Jesus.
[385:06.45]Alright.
[385:06.75]I'm leaving.
[385:07.07]I'm leaving.
[385:07.33]I don't know what he's doing.
[385:07.95]I don't know.
[385:08.24]He's freaking out.
[385:09.12]He's freaking me out.
[385:09.80]He's freaking me out.
[385:10.26]I don't know what he's doing.
[385:10.86]He's moving around weird.
[385:11.84]He's moving.
[385:12.16]Get out.
[385:12.44]Get out.
[385:12.82]Get out.
[385:13.02]Get out.
[385:13.28]He's doing weird shit.
[385:16.58]Alright.
[385:17.04]He's freaking me out.
[385:17.68]I don't like it.
[385:20.51]He was like, he was going like this.
[385:21.84]That was fucking scary.
[385:24.54]I don't know what he was doing.
[385:25.32]I don't know.
[385:34.16]Dude, I'm sorry.
[385:34.84]I might be freaking out, but when the character's sitting there going like this.
[385:41.57]It's like, okay, you're like, you're hacking the game or something.
[385:44.47]And like, you're about to like throw up like a fucking thousand pixels on the screen and my computer's gonna crash.
[386:02.22]Alright, froggy chair.
[386:05.62]What do you say?
[386:13.81]Let's go for it.
[386:16.96]Cool.
[386:42.95]Good start.
[386:53.22]What are you doing?
[386:54.82]What was that?
[387:13.26]He's exhausted!
[387:14.74]Oh, please.
[387:17.22]That was fucking weird.
[387:45.08]Good job
[387:59.77]Alright, this should be it.
[388:00.95]Nice job.
[388:22.51]Alright, so was that the person that really needed the help?
[388:25.83]Anybody else need help here?
[388:31.67]Jesus is in chat right now.
[388:33.45]What?
[388:33.67]What do you want?
[388:34.17]I don't know.
[388:36.47]You scared me.
[388:37.25]It was scary.
[388:37.99]I don't know what was going on.
[388:38.65]I was scary.
[388:40.65]You look like a greaser, not greasy.
[388:42.55]Oh, okay.
[388:54.80]How do you even get the name on Twitch?
[389:02.23]Real... Real Jesus Christ.
[389:07.05]I feel like... I feel like that's going to get caught by a filter eventually.
[389:18.29]That name is just so fucking weird.
[389:21.17]Alright.
[389:21.81]Is this Jesus?
[389:26.73]No, it's not.
[389:28.38]Whoa, that was kind of scary.
[389:31.52]The real Jesus Christ.
[389:40.57]That's so fucking funny.
[389:41.99]This is just ridiculous.
[390:02.90]Careful for the boss.
[390:03.68]Boss is right behind you, man.
[390:05.72]Careful for the boss.
[390:08.16]Watch out.
[390:18.48]Ooh, back it up.
[390:24.02]Could be able to get a stagger here.
[390:36.94]Oh no!
[390:37.50]Nice job.
[391:04.35]Back it up.
[391:04.81]Back it up.
[391:05.13]You're good.
[391:14.62]Oh my god, I thought he died.
[391:15.64]Nice job.
[391:18.36]Imagine if the second coming happened during an Elden Ring stream.
[391:40.50]Are you going to play the new Lego Star Wars?
[391:41.92]Didn't that game already come out?
[391:44.16]I'm confused.
[391:44.81]Everybody would spam pog.
[391:50.79]There's a new one.
[391:58.85]Is it better than the old one?
[391:59.81]Alright, maybe one more of these.
[392:03.75]One more of these and then I'm going to wrap it up with a little bit of PvP.
[392:11.74]Just came out.
[392:12.20]It's pretty fun.
[392:27.05]The actual second coming of Christ, but he spawned an Elden Ring.
[392:47.27]It includes all the new movies.
[392:48.89]Alright.
[392:49.41]Okay.
[392:50.49]That makes sense.
[392:52.05]Maybe everybody is done with... Neil?
[393:00.26]Are we good?
[393:01.22]Did the three or four people that needed... Are we good?
[393:07.26]No help with Millenia?
[393:08.26]No, that's not happening.
[393:09.71]I will ruin all your games.
[393:10.77]Okay.
[393:13.57]Okay.
[393:17.43]Okay.
[393:17.65]I'm going to give it 10 more seconds.
[393:20.31]Here we go.
[393:25.99]Malenia is easier without help.
[393:27.79]I would imagine so.
[393:28.59]Because if she kills your cooperator and heals off of them, then you just have to deal with a way worse version.
[393:36.71]Alright, Ashley.
[393:41.44]Go for it.
[393:46.25]Cool weapon.
[393:47.58]I like the Gideon Hoffner stuff.
[393:51.44]Wait, this boss is dead.
[393:57.94]Did you kill this already?
[394:03.54]What are we doing?
[394:08.13]Where are we going?
[394:10.85]What are you going to do?
[394:13.61]Where do you want to go?
[394:17.77]I'm following your lead.
[394:19.19]Wherever we're going, let's go.
[394:20.89]You didn't have to do that.
[394:38.25]You didn't have to do that.
[394:41.23]We could have just walked around.
[394:43.93]Oh, I kind of feel bad.
[394:47.71]Well, it was cool to see you for the few seconds that we were there.
[394:54.10]It was just a short cameo.
[394:58.38]Alright, let's go to... I'm going to do some PvP.
[395:00.38]I'm going to do Moonvale PvP.
[395:02.00]I'm going to be an asshole.
[395:05.23]We're going to pick a spot.
[395:06.21]This is where we're going to finish the stream this way.
[395:07.85]How about like... Mm-hmm.
[395:18.83]Is someone in Caelid?
[395:20.31]Over here somewhere?
[395:20.77]I guess we could do it here.
[395:24.38]Why not over here by our den?
[395:31.98]Yeah, like right over here.
[395:36.00]Password is still Cheese Doctor, so your sign's down.
[395:44.21]We'll do this.
[395:44.75]I'll do another three or four.
[395:46.53]And then I'm going to call it for today.
[395:47.49]Okay.
[395:52.65]Oh, you can't do it here.
[395:54.63]Yeah, you can.
[395:55.55]Is that not accurate?
[395:59.17]Is that wrong?
[396:02.51]Okay.
[396:04.29]Um, how about... That Church of Vows was a pretty good spot.
[396:17.34]Yeah, this was a good spot.
[396:18.44]Right outside.
[396:24.53]Am I ever going to do this again?
[396:25.39]Um... I don't know.
[396:28.76]I mean, this is really fun.
[396:30.14]If you guys want to do this again, I would definitely do it again.
[396:40.00]This is a good spot.
[396:44.64]Alright, we have an actual Psycho.
[396:51.54]I'm going to do Moonvale.
[396:52.33]I'm curious how it is.
[396:56.35]Even if it makes me an asshole.
[396:58.10]Sorry.
[397:05.48]What's today?
[397:05.80]Today's Saturday.
[397:06.38]I actually might not be able to stream tomorrow.
[397:16.21]We're going to have to do DOS on Monday.
[397:17.37]I don't know why I thought it was Friday.
[397:21.03]I thought it was Friday.
[397:22.29]Did I?
[397:30.56]Did I summon somebody?
[397:31.10]I just did.
[397:31.42]Alright, this barf drinker again.
[397:34.36]We might do a rematch.
[397:35.66]Alright, a gamer boy.
[397:36.70]Do I have a backup save?
[397:45.99]Um, I think I'm fine.
[397:47.03]I'm okay.
[397:49.41]There's been like one or two hackers, but it was just like kind of... I mean, it was pretty funny.
[397:53.69]It was just like insanity.
[398:01.13]I don't mind people just kind of fucking having fun as long as nobody, like, actually tries to, you know, break my game or something.
[398:07.45]But, you know.
[398:11.27]Hello!
[398:11.59]Did we confirm that Jesus Christ was a hacker?
[398:17.48]I mean, in the video game.
[398:21.84]That's unbelievable.
[398:23.26]Alright, okay, alright, alright.
[398:24.82]Alright, I'll take it off.
[398:25.92]I'll take it off.
[398:26.32]Okay, I'll take it off.
[398:30.27]I'll take it.
[398:31.09]It's mine.
[398:33.28]Oh, hi.
[398:33.66]Yeah.
[398:34.08]You can heal, by the way.
[398:34.82]Yeah, that weapon's awful.
[398:36.94]That weapon's unbelievable.
[398:38.24]But good luck dealing with this.
[398:50.87]Alright, you can heal again.
[398:51.53]You can heal again.
[398:52.88]That's really stupid.
[398:53.64]You can heal again.
[398:54.50]Heal again.
[398:59.74]I healed, so you should heal too.
[399:03.06]Let's just start over.
[399:04.96]Let's just start over.
[399:06.80]That wasn't fair.
[399:09.72]Heal all the way.
[399:14.14]Heal all the way.
[399:14.86]There we go.
[399:15.66]Alright, so now we can actually go.
[399:16.89]Let's go.
[399:46.28]WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING WITH MY CONTROLLER?!
[399:48.24]Okay
[399:58.68]Oh, I have my weapons flipped.
[400:00.78]My weapons have flipped.
[400:04.63]Let me fix my weapons.
[400:17.91]I was wondering why, because the spin actually was pretty bad.
[400:20.91]That was doing work.
[400:24.01]Good game, though.
[400:28.09]That's so fucking stupid.
[400:33.09]Alright.
[400:41.41]Now I'm ready to PvP.
[400:43.43]Gun.
[400:54.90]You actually have a gun?
[401:01.19]Do you think Jesus has ever BLJ'd in... Wait, you mean like... Wait, like the... That thing?
[401:14.35]That means, right?
[401:20.85]Wait, do you think Jesus is going like... Probably.
[401:27.29]It would make sense.
[401:28.49]Alright, how are you?
[401:30.06]Let's do it.
[401:40.46]Weren't ready for the fucking rain of stars.
[401:46.77]Where you going?
[401:52.47]Yo!
[401:53.81]Oh, that was cool.
[402:08.08]Alright.
[402:10.18]Goodbye.
[402:11.73]Damn.
[402:13.31]Okay.
[402:18.79]That person looked like they had a camera.
[402:22.93]They're just snapping pictures of us.
[402:35.46]GG, good game.
[402:44.17]Alright, let's get a good one here.
[402:46.55]Helicopter.
[402:49.69]Kind of need to know.
[402:53.43]Need to know what the helicopter character looks like.
[402:58.90]I think I'm not doing spells.
[402:59.82]I think I'm just going to go two-handed.
[403:00.82]This is an exploit?
[403:06.73]Well, whatever.
[403:20.39]What do you got?
[403:33.24]Got it.
[403:59.82]Nice recovery, though!
[404:01.33]It's gonna be close.
[404:08.47]Oh!
[404:09.29]Good game.
[404:11.15]Who died first?
[404:12.69]Who died first?
[404:14.87]Oh!
[404:18.14]Oh, we gotta die.
[404:18.64]That was a cool build.
[404:26.96]I still have the aggro ring on?
[404:28.74]Oh, that's right.
[404:32.30]Oops.
[404:34.82]This is... No, I don't.
[404:35.52]Yeah, I do.
[404:36.78]What was on there before?
[404:37.48]This is... Physical damage.
[404:42.92]I think it was magic damage.
[404:46.46]Yeah, whatever.
[404:54.73]Ooh.
[404:56.15]Ooh.
[404:57.88]Co-operator turned into at dessert.
[405:01.48]I'm for it.
[405:01.92]Let's go.
[405:02.18]Can we hear Shito?
[405:12.70]Uh, yeah.
[405:23.19]We keep cheese doctor as the community password after the stream.
[405:25.83]Yeah, that sounds good.
[405:28.32]How are you?
[405:33.15]That's a weird move.
[405:40.33]Whoa!
[405:52.96]Oh shit!
[405:53.66]Nice!
[405:56.24]Okay, that was weird.
[405:59.38]There's a little purple thing.
[406:02.10]Okay.
[406:07.20]Carrying Slicer is really good.
[406:08.42]Don't I have it?
[406:11.34]Do I like Dairy Queen?
[406:13.06]Yeah, it's fine.
[406:14.06]It's good.
[406:16.49]Okay.
[406:32.57]Would GigaChad have... that weapon?
[406:37.45]I feel like GigaChad would use, like, the big hammer.
[406:53.24]How are you?
[407:12.27]Holy shit!
[407:48.79]Oh my god!
[407:49.81]Oh, that was so close.
[407:53.67]Nice fight.
[407:55.41]That move did almost 100% of my health.
[407:59.13]That was ridiculous.
[408:02.98]That is how much I had left.
[408:08.22]Wow.
[408:09.66]Good fight.
[408:19.11]I mean, barf drinker has been patiently waiting.
[408:21.09]Alright.
[408:25.47]Ugh.
[408:27.53]Why do I get so tired all of a sudden?
[408:28.57]I'm like tired.
[408:28.95]I don't know what happened.
[408:34.06]Summon code is cheese DR. Cheese doctor.
[408:38.24]Cheese... Cheese drive probably makes more sense, right?
[408:48.27]What's going on, barf drinker?
[408:49.79]Long time no see.
[408:59.72]I'm sitting in the bonfire with you.
[409:15.73]I like this guy.
[409:21.02]That's cute.
[409:25.15]Ow.
[409:27.31]Alright, well, now that you dropped our FPS by about 20%, let's go ahead and fight.
[409:30.35]Okay.
[409:42.13]I'm on fire.
[409:42.73]I don't know why I feel like I'm fighting an old lady.
[410:02.35]You piece of shit game.
[410:07.33]I feel like I'm fighting an old lady and she's like throwing just random shit in her kitchen.
[410:10.87]Or like in her living room.
[410:12.30]Like, she's just like... I'm like up in an old lady's attic.
[410:17.06]And she's just like throwing fucking paintings at me and random shit.
[410:29.72]Like, Grandma, what are you doing up in the attic?
[410:31.70]I'm just trying to go through some old books and stuff.
[410:33.86]And she fucking just starts throwing them at me.
[410:50.50]Why are you so- it's so weird!
[410:52.02]It's so weird to fight you.
[410:56.25]Is that a bomb?
[410:56.99]It's a mine, isn't it?
[410:57.93]Is this a mine?
[411:02.15]Yo, what is that?
[411:05.81]Grandma, where did you find this in the attic?
[411:19.84]Come here!
[411:23.60]I wanna backstab.
[411:24.56]I wanna backstab Grandma to end it.
[411:31.63]God damn it!
[411:32.97]Get over here!
[411:34.67]Come on!
[411:41.32]You grandma.
[411:55.33]How are you still alive?
[411:56.39]How does it do two damage?
[412:07.68]Alright.
[412:08.52]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[412:11.62]No, no, no.
[412:13.04]I'm not gonna let this happen.
[412:19.88]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[412:20.96]I can't believe it.
[412:22.06]I lost.
[412:23.82]I lost.
[412:31.25]Grandma, we just... Grandma was like fucking breathing out like a crack pipe at the end.
[412:41.73]I was trying to get a backstab.
[412:43.35]I was trying to go... I could have killed Barf Drinker at any moment.
[412:48.23]At any moment.
[412:50.02]But I was trying to get the backstab.
[412:51.20]I was trying to be cute with it.
[412:53.20]Pretty much what I'm saying is Barf Drinker put it back down and we're round two.
[413:09.31]I can't believe you died to Barf Drinker.
[413:13.80]Dad of air fryer?
[413:23.79]That's a pretty good name.
[413:38.78]Clearly you don't own one.
[413:40.92]I don't own an air fryer.
[413:46.31]And I don't think I ever will.
[413:47.13]That was Robin?
[413:49.91]That was perfectly fine.
[413:50.98]Hey!
[413:52.62]Alright Dad, let's do it.
[414:08.75]Dad, you got low HP.
[414:20.03]At what level are you?
[414:23.52]Just a little bigger?
[414:38.93]No air flyer?
[414:46.47]By the way, I'm not even sure that guy owns an air fryer, because why would you make an air fryer character and not have, like, heat moves?
[414:55.59]Like, where's the fireballs coming out of your hands and shit?
[415:01.68]Alright, here's Ashley.
[415:05.92]You jumped off the cliff before.
[415:14.57]Marf Drinker Part 2.
[415:15.37]Oh yeah, well, don't worry.
[415:22.98]Let's go for it.
[415:36.99]Here we go.
[415:41.44]That weapon is scary looking.
[415:55.75]That's a good move actually.
[416:15.47]Ooh!
[416:15.85]I caught right in the air.
[416:16.99]I'm doing it too.
[416:31.47]He jumped over it!
[416:36.59]Alright, well, I'll get to drink another one because you drank two.
[416:39.76]Fuck.
[417:00.47]Shit!
[417:06.98]Okay.
[417:07.18]Yeah, if they heal, you can heal.
[417:10.74]That's the... If they heal, you can heal too.
[417:16.66]But don't ever go more than they.
[417:19.16]Let's say somebody drinks two.
[417:21.34]Then you can drink two.
[417:22.04]If somebody drinks five, you can drink five.
[417:24.94]If somebody drinks one, you can't drink five.
[417:31.84]Okay.
[417:32.22]That weapon's... What is that weapon?
[417:34.08]That weapon's actually really cool.
[417:35.65]I really like that.
[417:37.97]to say the F word.
[417:41.35]Why did I just say the F word?
[417:47.23]I've received an air fryer in the mail by mistake.
[417:49.53]I've kept it, but I never used it.
[417:51.19]Is it just in the box?
[418:01.08]That's the gargoyle twin blade.
[418:02.32]Okay, cool.
[418:05.98]Hey!
[418:10.58]Now we begin.
[418:24.02]Holy shit!
[418:25.50]What's that?
[418:25.82]Is that the hammer?
[418:36.27]Oh man!
[418:39.38]I've never seen that before.
[418:40.30]That thing's crazy.
[418:45.70]Fight.
[418:50.73]That weapon seems really fun.
[418:54.55]That's the final boss soul.
[418:56.17]Uh, right, right, right, right, right.
[418:57.07]Alright, let's do, uh, I'll do three more.
[419:02.11]I want my rematch.
[419:03.63]With, uh, the barf ringer.
[419:11.49]I mean P-Brain, yeah.
[419:16.15]P-Brain is just a big dumb guy with a hammer?
[419:19.47]Why are you P-Brain?
[419:26.29]I hope this person just holds R1 the whole time.
[419:29.45]Just R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[419:30.49]It doesn't do anything else.
[419:40.29]Stake.
[419:44.84]I love doing that.
[419:45.64]Alright, let's go.
[419:55.19]Oh, I thought I got mine first.
[420:08.02]I did.
[420:16.91]Ooh.
[420:22.50]What happened?
[420:35.29]Oh, you came back too quickly.
[420:38.09]Let's drop you, Brandon.
[420:40.47]Good game.
[420:46.65]That first move was crazy.
[420:47.49]Okay.
[420:55.28]A couple more.
[420:58.97]It's Millenia.
[421:02.79]Scum.
[421:05.07]Meet Rein Tilda.
[421:07.65]Alright, I'll come back to you.
[421:15.30]This guy looks like a World of Warcraft human.
[421:25.76]Is matchmaking on?
[421:26.74]Cross region matchmaking is on.
[421:28.83]Let me just make sure it is.
[421:33.43]Yes.
[421:42.77]Look at VRJosh here helping.
[421:59.95]I'm not going to fight you.
[422:00.99]I just want to get a look at you.
[422:01.89]Your character looks... I'm not going to hurt you.
[422:06.19]I just want to see your face.
[422:07.25]God, the extreme movement.
[422:09.89]It's like a snake.
[422:10.61]Everybody in FromSoftware is a snake.
[422:14.46]It's just... Sudden movements freak them out.
[422:17.52]Okay, just wait, wait, wait.
[422:24.46]Can I... Let me get a close up of your face.
[422:37.18]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[422:39.90]Let's do it.
[422:40.28]Okay.
[422:47.04]You ready?
[422:48.98]Are you ready?
[422:49.47]Uh, let's go.
[422:51.43]Three.
[422:52.49]I'm just gonna fight you.
[422:53.61]Okay, let's go.

[424:24.32]Actually... That weapon is so cool.
[424:26.54]I want to use it.
[424:29.30]Oh, I said I would come back to you.
[424:41.76]Also, not everybody knows the PvP etiquette, right?
[424:49.67]So, whatever.
[424:50.03]It doesn't matter.
[424:50.61]It's fine.
[424:52.01]It's fine.
[424:57.29]If somebody heals, whatever.
[424:58.71]I mean, not everybody studies the FromSoftware unwritten rules.
[425:02.64]Alright.
[425:04.84]Meet Gruntilda.
[425:06.34]Let's do it.
[425:15.93]Jumped in a little too early and that's gonna be the downfall Whoa

[426:12.11]I don't even know if Barf Drinker's still here.
[426:18.81]Are you still here, Barf Drinker?
[426:26.48]Where is Barf Drinker?
[426:27.42]I'm gonna re-look.
[426:31.52]The loathsome Barf Drinker.
[426:33.92]Hmm...
[426:43.50]We might have to reload a new area.
[426:48.80]The ever-brilliant gold mass.
[426:52.72]And Sir Gideon Ofnir.
[426:54.86]You all know it.
[426:55.80]Alright, barf drinker.
[426:59.22]I want you 1v1.

[427:51.94]Interesting.
[427:54.24]Oh, a lot of- I got a lot of calls.
[427:58.66]Alright.
[428:05.19]I'm not messing around this time.
[428:06.31]I'll go in full fuck face mode.
[428:19.50]It's not him?
[428:26.00]Is this not the right person?
[428:29.84]Yeah, it is, right?
[428:31.24]This is a fake barf drinker.
[428:32.88]No, it's not.
[428:36.25]That's how we can tell it's a real barf drinker.
[428:37.89]Wait a minute.
[428:39.35]This is a fake barf drinker.
[428:43.87]This is horseshit.
[428:44.57]That's a fake barf drinker.
[428:45.59]You know why?
[428:46.09]Because he was... Barf drinker was putting graces down before.
[428:50.05]Not these.
[428:51.89]This is not real.
[428:56.63]Let's get out of here with this.
[429:00.61]Alright.
[429:01.97]Let's go.
[429:07.72]Break this.
[429:11.20]Take a sip of this.
[429:24.89]Do you see what I'm capable of?
[429:28.62]Not even the real fucking dung drinker, whatever his name is.
[429:48.43]Where are you going?
[429:50.09]Where are you going?
[430:14.62]Get over here, you Dung Eater!
[430:33.44]Alright, where's the real barf drinker?
[430:41.55]Everybody's going to start to... I don't think I'm going to be able to find the real barf drinker, guys.
[430:47.75]Are you kidding me?
[430:48.43]Look at this.
[430:49.43]You ready?
[430:51.83]Everybody's going to be that now.
[430:56.22]Okay, thank god.
[430:59.50]Barf two.
[431:02.56]Come on now.
[431:04.51]Keck W, okay.

[431:31.40]Yeah, they're all putting on the barf drinker helmet.
[431:36.96]Where's Barf Drinker?
[431:41.70]I don't see the Barf Drinker.
[431:56.09]Okay, that's Hog Rider again.
[432:00.34]Summon multiple people and have a big battle royale.
[432:05.21]Alright, I am now only summoning barf drinkers.
[432:07.53]I just want to make sure that's very clear.
[432:12.47]What item do I have to take to fight, like, three barf drinkers?
[432:23.77]Ready!
[432:28.58]Alright, I want how many people can you have in your game?
[433:03.17]I want three barf drinkers right now.
[433:10.55]So how do I do that?
[433:15.85]Without any co-operators.
[433:19.10]I use this.

[437:22.13]It's gonna be stupid.
[437:40.63]Where is he?
[437:48.13]Barf Drinker, can you do it?
[437:54.73]2v1.
[437:54.83]Where's my thing?

[441:59.36]An invader, though.
[442:00.30]Alright.
[442:00.98]I want Barf Drinker as an invader and I want a Barf Drinker as a cooperator.
