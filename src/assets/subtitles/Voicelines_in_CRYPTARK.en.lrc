[00:00.05]And it depressurized, move out to the arming area, and careful you don't bang up my flight deck.
[00:06.65]I would recommend lowering our equipment overhead to increase our potential profits, but that goes against my firm belief in OVERWHELMING FIREPOWER.
[00:16.34]Sorry, but sometimes I get a little tickle in my throat.
[00:20.88]Let's go, a bounty's been posted, and every privateer tugboat in the sector's looking for a piece of the action.
[00:28.71]Come on, let's get you geared up.
[00:30.71]I can hear the comm chat if I'm on a cruise, and there's no way those mooks are going to beat us to the fight.
[00:37.49]There's the Cryptark.
[00:38.87]Due to target saturation, I'm just going to go ahead and remove the heat locks on all your weapons.
[00:43.43]You'll be fine, probably.
[00:47.23]You see the size of these things?
[00:49.27]Just give me a moment.
[00:50.55]I got the feeling my poor suit ain't coming back from this.
[00:55.23]Barrels worn out, armor melted through, servos stripped down?
[00:58.95]Gah, I'm gonna need to grow another pair of arms to keep up with these refits.
[01:04.78]Hey, we got a few wins under our belt now, but don't get sloppy.
[01:08.00]These upcoming ships will need a good whack to open up.
[01:12.24]Pioneer suit is fed, fueled, and ready to frag.
[01:15.28]No funny business now, and you have her back home before 11.
[01:20.63]I'm pretty sure I used enough tape, but just keep an eye on the starboard compression Jack.
[01:25.68]It might pop off if you pull too many Gs.
[01:29.40]Pre-flight is green, rack manacles unlocked, and munition cassettes are up and spinning.
[01:33.64]Whenever you're ready, slowpoke.
[01:37.78]Hey, look at that sucker pump!
[01:39.98]The cryptochorus trashed, and my suit made it out in one piece, too!
[01:46.63]Listen, this domino projector will let you operate multiple suits at once, but they're sympathetically linked.
[01:52.41]Armor and ammunition are shared between the two.
[01:55.15]If one gets trashed, you both go down in flames, right?
[01:58.41]Simple quantum physics.
[02:02.23]Check, check.
[02:03.19]You hear me in there?
[02:04.36]Sometimes the neural splitting makes pilots a little bit fuzzy.
[02:09.36]I ramped up your telejection matrix for these extended ranges, but I haven't tested it much.
[02:14.34]If it only gets you halfway back, I apologize in advance.
[02:20.02]Those shunt engines will be getting a good workout.
[02:23.06]After you pop it's security core, you'll be able to siphon out enough juice to jump to the next ship in the fleet.
[02:29.70]Your armament parts should have made contact with the derelict fleet by now.
[02:32.97]We just rerouted most of these from the supply chain, so I'm not really sure what's in them.
[02:39.56]Right, let's go down the checklist here and make sure you didn't knock any screws loose on the trip over.
[02:46.20]Look, whatever happens out there, just don't let them take you alive, okay?
[02:51.83]We found a few more of those dead lobster fellas that came here before us.
[02:55.15]Except these ones are drilled full of alien cybernetics and riddled with experimental vivisections.
[03:00.13]Real scary part is, they're not even that old.
[03:03.34]A few decades tops.
[03:06.66]One of your weapons is out of ammo!
[03:09.62]There should be some supply pods we launched earlier kicking around the ship.
[03:13.06]You can rearm at one of them.
[03:15.92]I noticed every time you come back from a mission, you're shot full of holes.
[03:20.32]Maybe try out this new cloaking field and save me some trouble with the welding, huh?
[03:27.55]We got our hands on some EMP weaponry.
[03:30.53]This gear will scramble those critters good.
[03:34.19]Check.
[03:34.97]Now spit out a few grenades.
[03:36.87]Make sure the feed hasn't gummed up again.
[03:40.52]Good.
[03:41.36]Finally, fire up that shield generator.
[03:43.90]I'd rather you burn out the power cell than bring my suit back with holes in it.
[03:49.00]Keep an eye out for these alien terminals.
[03:51.18]In exchange for their data banks, our benefactors will be providing us with new equipment licenses for better weapons and gear.
[03:58.95]They're also licensing us some serious military gear for these advanced data terminals.
[04:04.45]I guess they expect us to give all these toys back when we're done here.
[04:10.12]Hey, look at us.
[04:11.54]We got our mitts on some new equipment licenses.
[04:14.02]Plug it in the loadout rig here, and I'll get you all geared up, sonny.
[04:19.01]Hey, remember, all this stuff's got to be paid for.
[04:22.33]Equipment costs are only logged after you leave the hangar.
[04:25.74]So feel free to test out new weapons on the target simp.
[04:30.21]Judging by the energy scarring on this alien chassis we pulled in and a few other examples, it looks like there was some pretty intense infighting within the fleet.
[04:38.73]Seems to have been bad blood between those with excessive cyber alterations and those keen on keeping all their original bits intact.
[04:46.82]Pretty obvious which side runs that argument, but a civil war of that scale does explain the militarized hostility we've been encountering on these ships.
[04:55.94]I'm no art expert, but even I can tell what's going on in this drawing we had recovered.
[05:00.30]These alien folk were happy and frolicking on their nice green homeworld.
[05:04.56]But then, bam!
[05:06.32]A second sun shows up and crashes the party.
[05:09.91]Ran that star map data we had through the retro simulator again, and sure enough, their home system hooked up with a wayward star, and they got hit with a double sunrise.
[05:18.45]Whew!
[05:19.17]Looks like all that solar backwashing gravitational torsion was enough to glass the place.
[05:25.03]These alien ships are chock-full of advanced tech and science stuff we'd never dreamed of.
[05:29.39]But I can safely say that their propulsion systems are woefully disappointing, to be polite.
[05:36.40]Looking at these engine parts we pulled from the last job, no FTL drives, no wormhole stabilizers, no STC folder arrays, just plain-jane sub-light thrusters.
[05:45.54]They may have come from real far away, but buddy, they sure took the scenic route to get here.
[05:51.63]Local vector with target vessel is locked.
[05:54.03]Operate light screen.
[05:57.19]If this is what these guys did to lawbreakers, I'm glad we still use the good old death penalty.
[06:03.61]This poor fella's been hardwired directly into his gunnery station, along with what seems to be a list of infractions.
[06:09.68]What's more, it looks like most of his brain case has been filled with targeting computers and chemical injectors.
[06:16.06]Lobotomy by Cybernetics.
[06:19.55]They've been out here for so long, they're cannibalizing themselves for parts.
[06:25.39]I was wondering what these more freakish alien machines were designed to do exactly.
[06:29.66]But this nasty looking cutter seems to answer my question.
[06:32.82]Reclamation of salvageable materials.
[06:36.96]Checklists are cleared, Pioneer spit shined and weapons free.
[06:40.68]I'll get the angle grinder out for when you get back.
[06:44.61]You're getting lit up like a light bulb!
[06:46.57]Activate one of those repair kits.
[06:48.23]I'll get to a repair pod and patch up my suit.
[06:52.00]Guns racked and ammo stacked.
[06:53.70]Time for some fireworks.
[06:55.28]Don't be shy with those trigger fingers now.
[06:59.18]Micro, nuclear, tactical warheads.
[07:02.23]The government officially condemns the use of these things.
[07:05.09]I guess that's why they're letting us take them for a spin instead.
[07:09.86]The contractors have opened up a few new weapon licenses in exchange for recovered data terminals.
[07:15.18]We'll need this heavier ordnance moving forward.
[07:18.99]Now they're licensing us industrial equipment instead of weapons.
[07:22.93]Corrosive unguent projector.
[07:25.55]Some sort of ghoul gun for dissolving scrap metal.
[07:29.37]Got some new special munitions fresh off the black site.
[07:33.10]Nano trackers and vectin stabilizers.
[07:36.62]Back in my day, bullets only flew in the direction you pointed.
[07:41.56]The old gunhead here's got four weapon hardpoints and four item brackets.
[07:47.23]First up, rattle off a few rounds from the machine gun into the targets.
[07:52.27]Check.
[07:53.05]Next, the ram spike should punch a hole through anything that gets too close.
[07:57.58]Targets up!
[07:59.77]I got all the armaments cataloged by type.
[08:02.14]Be sure to let me know how much ammo you want for each gun, too.
[08:05.24]These things get hungry out there.
[08:08.20]Lastly, there's four utility item brackets that can be loaded up with whatever goodies you think might come in handy.
[08:15.31]I can modify the amount of hull durability your suit has as well.
[08:19.05]Bolting on extra plating can get pricey, though.
[08:23.23]Right, let's get down to business.
[08:25.27]You got four weapon points that can carry whatever hardware we got licenses for.
[08:30.67]Your aim must be getting shoddy, because our cleaner on the inside just sent us an alien beastie, fully intact.
[08:37.90]A fossilized skeleton with extensive cybernetic augmentations.
[08:41.70]Well, skeleton might be giving it too much credit.
[08:45.15]This guy's not much more than a skull and spinal column with a murder machine wrapper.
[08:49.65]He's long dead, but his implants don't seem to know that.
[08:52.97]Creepy robotic bone puppet.
[08:56.28]Remember, you can test fire any of your weapons at the targets for no cost.
[09:00.62]Looks and feels just like the real thing, but it's all AR simulated.
[09:04.64]You didn't think I'd really let you blast all that heavy artillery inside my pressurized hangar, did you?
