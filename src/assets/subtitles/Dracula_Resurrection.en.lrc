[00:04.78]Dude, what about... What is Dracula the Resurrection?
[00:13.25]Should we try this one?
[00:20.86]We're on a vampire theme, apparently.
[00:22.26]Alright, Dracula the Resurrection.
[00:23.86]Let's see if I can get this one to work.
[00:40.10]What are your poor editors going to do with these streams?
[00:45.30]Yeah, I think so here.
[00:47.12]That's funny.
[00:47.52]Bring that up.
[00:48.02]So it's interesting since I said that I wasn't going to be doing this like anymore, the stream is kind of turning into a broadcast.
[00:58.17]Do you know what I mean?
[01:03.23]It's like, it's like broadcast mode.
[01:10.10]Cause I used to, it used to be, I would set up a whole thing and it would be like a show for a lot of those streams back in the day.
[01:19.43]Yeah.
[01:19.59]Just like playing WoW for like 12 hours, like five days in a row is not, that's not really like a show.
[01:32.95]Alright, here we go.
[01:33.41]Let's try this and see if it works.
[01:36.19]Promising.
[01:38.58]Already pretty promising.
[01:39.52]I would love to get control of my mouse.
[01:49.65]Come on!
[01:50.09]People need to see this!
[01:59.68]Dude, this is so promising.
[02:01.32]Come on.
[02:02.38]Capture it.
[02:04.30]Ooh, I think it worked.
[02:06.02]Oh, boys and girls, we are in business.
[02:18.36]Sorry for the delay.
[02:19.20]I just gotta make it look so scuffed.
[02:25.54]Hold on.
[02:29.09]Come on, quick, quick.
[02:29.97]This is important shit that we need to know.
[02:31.43]Dracula.
[02:46.69]Is that Dracula?
[03:02.14]Wait, why was he in a box?
[03:09.12]After weeks spent battling the monster, we have finally managed to destroy Dracula.
[03:14.38]But at a terrible price.
[03:16.40]Quincy lies dying at our feet.
[03:18.04]That was made out of steel.
[03:19.18]All we can do is be with him as he slips into oblivion.
[03:22.94]Mina is saved, yes.
[03:24.88]But for how long?
[03:26.60]The vampire's blood runs in her veins.
[03:29.56]though the marks on her neck have disappeared who knows whether they will reappear or not one day oh true we all saw Dracula disappear yet not one of us can say for certain whether we have actually defeated the fiend I'll turn it up yep okay so is this a point and click adventure game
[04:02.99]That's kind of amazing.
[04:03.77]Oh, the game crashed, by the way.
[04:06.81]Alright, I want to watch that cutscene in full volume anyways.
[04:09.01]There we go.
[04:14.20]Alright, we're good.
[04:17.12]It might be a lot louder this time, but just be aware.
[04:19.22]I don't know how loud this game might get, so be careful.
[04:21.26]I'm not kidding.
[04:34.67]Alright, seven years later, this is London.
[04:37.75]Jonathan, please excuse my writing, but my hand trembles so I can barely hold my pen.
[04:44.69]After you left this morning, a strange dizziness came over me.
[04:49.06]I went out for some fresh air, and when I looked up, I was at Carfax.
[04:54.64]Dracula's home was summoning me as if he'd returned and wanted me again.
[04:58.98]Yeah, this is insane handwriting.
[05:00.24]As I write, I can no longer master the power that is drawing me there.
[05:04.89]Okay.
[05:27.73]Seward, my friend, my deepest fears were founded.
[05:32.17]This morning, Mina was overcome by a fit of insanity and she took off for Transylvania alone.
[05:38.57]Apparently, Dracula is back.
[05:41.38]There's somebody in the chat right now that is so annoyed by this that lives in Transylvania.
[05:46.74]If so, you will have to recruit new allies and go back into battle.
[05:51.40]Beware and be careful.
[05:53.93]I'm leaving all post haste to catch up with Mina.
[05:56.89]She only has a few hours lead.
[05:59.07]I hope I find her before it's too late.
[06:02.29]Jonathan.
[06:07.39]It's like, okay, like California has Disneyland.
[06:11.55]Like Transylvania has Dracula.
[06:14.97]Oh damn, this is like a first person.
[06:17.19]Whoa, this is kind of cracked out.
[06:30.29]Alright, we're going in.
[06:37.45]Is this the opening cutscene to Diablo II?
[06:48.23]This whole place is gonna light on fire.
[06:59.95]Oh my god, these guys look fucking crazy.
[07:04.55]What?
[07:20.13]Welcome, stranger.
[07:22.09]Welcome to my humble inn.
[07:24.77]I hope those two brutes didn't hurt ya.
[07:27.74]I cannot imagine what got into them.
[07:29.48]Never mind.
[07:30.62]You must have had a long trip, and it is already very late.
[07:34.22]Now, sit by the stove and get warm.
[07:37.36]If you need anything at all, I'm there in the kitchen.
[07:40.80]Please feel free.
[07:41.91]Make yourself at home.
[07:44.83]That mouth keeps kind of protruding out.
[07:47.31]This game is... I think we found a good one, boys and girls.
[07:50.35]I think we found a good one here.
[07:54.47]I'm into it.
[07:55.53]And it's late at night too.
[07:57.23]This is perfect.
[07:58.27]What do I do?
[08:02.67]Should I go look in the soup?
[08:06.66]Why is she not moving?
[08:16.71]Madam, I must go to the castle as soon as possible.
[08:20.35]To the castle?
[08:22.39]It's late.
[08:23.93]The road is long and hardly safe.
[08:26.17]She's locked in.
[08:28.37]Don't bother about going to the castle tonight.
[08:30.77]I'll get your room ready and tomorrow we're discussing.
[08:34.05]Tomorrow will be too late.
[08:35.09]I must go to the castle now.
[08:36.85]Do you really have to go?
[08:40.84]tonight is St. George's eve at the stroke of midnight all the evil roaming the world will be mastered on Earth do you realize it is Diablo II. keep going in close for your mother's sake alright so what did we get out of that
[09:11.54]This is the night before where all the demons let loose and kill everybody.
[09:20.27]Can I save the game?
[09:21.01]I can.
[09:25.02]This is VR, by the way.
[09:26.93]This is a VR headset.
[09:29.05]Did I save it?
[09:29.75]Okay, I got it saved.
[09:31.95]Okay.
[09:33.97]I know I'm going to alt tab for a second.
[09:35.43]I know that's going to destroy everything.
[09:36.86]I saved it right there.
[09:38.46]I want to drop the volume by like 5% and I want to fix the video because I want to shift it to the right because it's driving me crazy.
[09:44.64]Alright, hold on to your hats.
[09:52.55]Drop that volume by like 5%, like just a little.
[09:57.39]And then I want to move this to the right.
[10:01.87]Nevermind.
[10:02.23]I can't even fix it, but I did drop the audio.
[10:04.77]I cannot even move it.
[10:05.59]We just have to put up with it.
[10:16.19]Okay.
[10:18.51]So where should I go?
[10:20.22]She said she was going to give me a room, right?
[10:32.68]This is gonna be scary.
[10:36.10]Okay, there's a candle down here.
[10:37.16]Should I go in the basement?
[10:48.11]Dark in here.
[10:54.79]That lady was scarier than Dracula.
[10:56.79]And we haven't even seen Dracula yet.
[11:08.49]OK, I guess I'll just play.
[11:10.73]Hold on.
[11:11.03]Ooh, gun.
[11:13.62]I don't even know what that is.
[11:17.60]What did I get?
[11:18.70]Is there a menu?
[11:19.74]Ooh, OK.
[11:21.08]Bullet.
[11:22.30]I have one bullet.
[11:23.22]I don't have a gun.
[11:44.08]What about talking to some of the other patrons here?
[11:46.42]What about this guy?
[11:52.48]I want to go to the castle.
[11:54.30]What is the shortest path?
[11:55.72]To the old castle.
[11:57.64]But it has been deserted ever since the Count disappeared.
[12:01.55]what do you want to do there stranger I don't have time to explain but it is very important for me to get to the castle immediately you ought to wait for daylight the path is strewn with traps you'll have to face countless unimaginable dangers you better stay with me we'll have a drink together that sounds great I cannot it's a question of life and death
[12:25.78]Whatever you like, young man.
[12:27.70]Well, you can take the old bridge behind the inn, but it's not safe.
[12:33.50]Is that really the only way?
[12:36.08]In any case, it's certainly the fastest.
[12:40.06]You know, it's time to throw shade at the entire video game industry.
[12:47.94]I, like, want them to look like this.
[12:50.81]Don't you?
[12:54.02]I, I, I, I don't... We, we, everything has to be so perfect and everything's got to be so, the graphics have to be so great.
[12:59.62]Look, everything has to be so high fidelity and everything looks so realistic and all the shading and lighting.
[13:05.08]I want them to look like that.
[13:06.00]I want, I want some character.
[13:17.46]What is this house, this inn, by the way?
[13:19.92]Look at this.
[13:21.78]What?
[13:21.98]What?
[13:23.41]the weirdest hallway system I've ever seen.
[13:25.19]There's one room in the entire hotel.
[13:30.29]And apparently it's the one I'm gonna stay in.
[13:31.46]Is that garlic?
[13:42.25]Oh, what am I... Garlic.
[13:45.29]I gotta say it the right way, dude.
[13:56.12]How do I go to sleep?
[14:00.54]What?
[14:01.78]Throw your chamber pot at him.
[14:19.12]Oh, I did that so I could, what, get up to there?
[14:21.58]Wait, what was the point of that?
[14:22.46]Am I just a weird guy that wants to re- Hey, don't be the weird guy that wants to rearrange the hotel room.
[14:28.84]We don't have to move the bed.
[14:29.76]We don't have to move the chair.
[14:30.88]The one chair in the corner just stays there and nobody sits in it.
[14:34.69]It's where the- It's where your clothes go.
[14:37.53]Right?
[14:37.67]That's where you, like, set out your clothes for the day or you put, like, your backpack.
[14:40.65]That chair is not to be sat in.
[14:41.77]Ever.
[14:42.35]Never.
[14:49.01]Is it a cock chair?
[14:54.80]The AutoMod is working overtime right now.
[14:59.18]Am I supposed to sit in this?
[15:02.46]Alright, what am I supposed to do?
[15:03.98]I moved that over here for no reason, but I can't even go over here.
[15:12.33]Did I miss something?
[15:13.05]Wait.
[15:19.61]Who said that?
[15:20.17]Nobody... No, no, no.
[15:20.77]Well, you don't understand.
[15:22.13]The AutoMod is holding these... It was 2,000 messages that just came in saying that.
[15:28.49]You're not seeing them, but I see them in the AutoMod.
[15:36.22]Alright.
[15:36.70]What was the point of that?
[15:39.08]Why did I just do that?
[15:42.88]Oh, shit.
[15:44.32]Oh, my God.
[15:44.68]I'm up here.
[15:46.38]What is that?
[15:49.68]A doorknob?
[15:52.84]Ooh!
[15:54.00]Let's go.
[15:55.32]Figured it out.
[16:10.29]Another candle.
[16:18.59]Did I do anything else?
[16:22.88]Telescope or something now.
[16:31.47]Oh shit.
[16:36.97]What?
[16:38.61]Alright, so I'm looking.
[16:41.33]I see somebody.
[16:42.35]Alright.
[16:50.81]So what was the point of that?
[16:53.17]Can I move it?
[16:58.39]I don't think I can move it around.
[16:59.81]Okay, well maybe that's all I can do.
[17:16.06]Now can I go to sleep?
[17:21.70]Probably activated something out here.
[17:22.94]I want to go.
[17:31.19]Don't go too fast though, because they might be.
[17:32.80]Open on the walls or you never know.
[17:50.19]This game's kind of freaking me out.
[17:52.46]I don't know why.
[17:53.06]Something's doing it for me.
[17:54.46]It's doing it.
[17:58.52]That's why I turned the volume down.
[17:59.60]Alright, I need a key for that.
[18:09.09]Remind me that there was a keyhole here.
[18:11.01]Okay.
[18:25.11]Madam, I must go to the castle as soon as possible.
[18:28.75]To the castle?
[18:30.79]It's late.
[18:31.39]Okay.
[18:35.48]Should I go?
[18:35.84]I'll go outside now.
[18:37.64]Jesus.
[18:38.18]So where is that pointing?
[18:43.10]Like, oh, I have to go.
[18:43.92]I haven't gone over here.
[19:01.50]Ooh.
[19:03.20]What's this?
[19:07.92]I guess I need a board.
[19:09.05]Alright, remind me that there's a board over there that needs to be placed or something.
[19:22.23]What was that guy?
[19:23.00]There was a guy walking around out here.
[19:34.51]Hans Lacus.
[19:38.07]Which way?
[19:42.35]I feel like this is scarier.
[19:43.37]I'm going this way.
[20:17.86]Oh, I think the guy's right there.
[20:20.64]That telescope went really far.
[20:22.02]Holy shit.
[20:25.69]That telescope went so far.
[20:28.69]Go away and don't come back.
[20:33.19]Go away and don't come back.
[20:35.51]Okay.
[20:59.17]Um, which way?
[21:03.97]I'm gonna get so lost here, you know I am.
[21:12.94]Oh god.
[21:13.46]Oh boy.
[21:19.42]There's a spirit coming out of this one.
[21:24.00]Save the game?
[21:24.60]Oh my god, you're right.
[21:36.70]What does it say?
[21:43.70]I don't want to read that out loud.
[21:46.01]I can touch this apparently, although I can't do anything with it.
[22:06.21]Can't touch this.
[22:17.44]Whoa.
[22:17.76]Alright, I got a weapon.
[22:24.26]Should I go try to smash that guy with this?
[22:41.91]Okay, I have a, what is it, a sickle?
[22:53.89]I went that way.
[22:54.93]Let's go this way.
[22:55.67]I kind of love this game.
[23:06.72]How did I sleep on this for so long?
[23:08.90]Why did I not play this?
[23:09.94]This is really cool.
[23:32.16]Oh shit.
[23:32.44]Cut them down?
[23:43.47]I have played Harvester.
[23:44.53]That was one of the most diabolical experiences of my whole life.
[23:54.74]I don't think I can do anything here yet.
[24:13.35]I have played Myst, but I hated Myst for a couple of reasons.
[24:19.02]The number one reason that I hated Myst was it was just... It's just like... It felt like just like an alien language.
[24:28.14]It just felt alien.
[24:29.70]Everything about it.
[24:30.48]You have to do so many puzzles in a row that connect to each other.
[24:37.69]I couldn't do it.
[24:41.74]Alright, so I have this sickle now.
[24:42.88]What can I do with it?
[24:45.32]Should I actually go give it to that guy?
[24:49.65]What does this guy say?
[24:52.63]I can't like.
[24:58.74]The thing I have to do is probably so obscure.
[25:19.37]This lady doesn't need anything.
[25:20.59]I gotta get rid of the guy that's at the bridge or whatever.
[25:37.02]Maybe I should go attack him.
[25:45.99]I'm gonna go attack that guy.
[25:47.15]See if I can.
[25:53.51]Go away!
[25:54.31]And don't come back!
[25:59.23]Go away!
[26:00.03]And don't come back!
[26:02.78]Shit.
[26:03.00]Alright, what do I do with that blade then?
[26:05.36]Is that something I could cut?
[26:07.90]Ooh, what's this?
[26:12.80]Damn it.
[26:22.11]I can't open it.
[26:27.31]OK.
[26:36.01]Just play the witness.
[26:39.05]Oh God, no.
[26:46.47]Alright.
[26:46.73]I don't know where to go.
[27:00.14]I look through the telescope and he's there.
[27:01.78]But I can't go near him.
[27:16.15]Play the room.
[27:16.77]The room is a classic game.
[27:18.05]That game is amazing.
[27:18.81]Maybe it has something to do here.
[27:31.21]Can't really grab anything.
[27:32.39]Nothing else to do here?
[27:38.95]Hmm.
[27:51.40]I'm stumped.
[28:07.38]Something back in the house with the sickle now?
[28:08.98]Let's see.
[28:13.98]That scares me every time.
[28:18.47]Hmm.
[28:19.47]What does the council think?
[28:29.33]What should I do?
[28:36.71]I can't open this door.
[28:37.79]Okay, I can go up here.
[28:54.85]There's the telescope.
[28:57.25]You look in the telescope.
[28:58.49]There he is.
[29:01.56]Can I, like, shoot him?
[29:03.74]Why does it... I got the... What can I do?
[29:05.92]This is weird.
[29:12.52]Why does it give me an interaction there?
[29:16.44]What?
[29:19.15]Wait.
[29:20.87]What?
[29:26.83]Did he aggro to me?
[29:28.05]What the hell just happened?
[29:40.52]Can I drop this chandelier in his head?
[29:54.43]I don't think I can drop this.
[29:58.68]Okay, well, he's gone now.
[29:59.86]Let's see what he says.
[30:00.98]What's his problem?
[30:02.52]Why would using a sickle on a telescope make this guy aggro to the inn?
[30:09.30]Cut the rope?
[30:11.86]Blind, blind, blind.
[30:12.93]Wait, what?
[30:14.75]I was looking.
[30:15.25]I was looking.
[30:15.97]I was looking, I swear.
[30:23.91]Oh, this rope.
[30:29.44]I don't think I can get it though.
[30:30.96]I don't have an interaction with it.
[30:38.19]Yeah, there's nothing to interact with.
[30:43.67]Oh, he's gone now.
[30:44.39]Wait, hold on.
[30:47.53]Okay, hold on.
[30:48.67]There is a sequence here.
[30:49.79]Hold on a second.
[30:55.62]Why would this aggro him?
[30:58.15]So we gotta run him over here and then we gotta drop the chandelier in his head.
[31:05.45]Why would he run here to go stand in the perfect place to die?
[31:08.41]What is he doing here?
[31:24.49]What the fuck are you talking about?
[31:25.93]What?
[31:29.81]That does not cut this?
[31:32.14]I could just go get a kitchen knife for it.
[31:41.42]Wait, can I beat him down there?
[31:42.72]Okay.
[31:47.75]Alright.
[31:48.05]Alright.
[31:48.45]Alright.
[31:48.67]Let's go.
[31:54.53]Is he still out there?
[31:59.22]Maybe she'll give me a kitchen knife.
[32:04.68]Now he's gone.
[32:05.30]Okay.
[32:07.86]So I have to cut the rope.
[32:10.14]Apparently you don't use this to cut the rope.
[32:12.14]I don't know how that's possible.
[32:16.58]Something else cuts that rope.
[32:25.77]It's gotta be in here.
[32:35.67]No?
[32:36.11]Really?
[32:36.39]What's that candle?
[32:43.21]I can't like cut the candle.
[32:48.95]Knife on the table.
[32:49.98]That's what I was thinking too.
[32:50.76]I don't see one.
[33:04.18]Outside some more.
[33:11.47]One of the guys from the cutscene had a knife.
[33:13.15]That's true.
[33:13.85]But where'd they go?
[33:27.42]Ooh!
[33:28.30]Wait a minute.
[33:28.80]This is a place we have not gone.
[33:41.67]Nothing though?
[33:53.22]Really?
[33:53.74]Come on, really?
[33:54.48]Nothing here?
[34:02.65]Doesn't want me to do anything.
[34:07.85]Nothing on the ground either.
[34:29.89]Fuck.
[34:30.05]Oh my god, I'm like scared right now.
[34:32.51]That actually scared me.
[34:33.37]I didn't realize there was going to be a person right here.
[34:37.80]Okay.
[34:38.04]Shit.
[35:04.27]How do I deal with this guy?
[35:08.78]Well, hold on.
[35:09.40]Gotta climb this treehouse.
[35:19.79]I'm gonna, like, drop a rock on his head.
[35:21.63]What the hell is that?
[35:42.99]I can't, there's probably something to do with like, you probably bring a bucket up here.
[35:46.81]Shit.
[35:55.34]Okay.
[35:55.60]The thing you have is a pickaxe.
[36:09.26]Someone said I need to use it at the cemetery.
[36:12.93]Can I use pickaxe to the cemetery?
[36:25.88]Where should I use it?
[36:32.90]That's holding the knife right there.
[36:33.92]There's a knife right there.
[36:34.62]That's a knife.
[36:36.67]He's holding the knife.
[36:39.19]How do I get that out?
[36:50.77]Thank God the helpers I Wouldn't do that
[37:16.40]So what is that thing?
[37:19.86]That's kind of scary.
[37:23.76]It better not be a sliding puzzle.
[37:25.58]I don't even say that.
[37:26.64]OK, so.
[37:48.11]Is this the Steam version?
[37:49.19]This is the GOG version.
[37:50.71]Is this the GOG version of the game?
[37:58.59]Put it in the telescope.
[38:07.93]I feel like there was a basin I could put this in.
[38:12.49]I don't remember.
[38:16.68]I don't have the pickaxe anymore though, so that guy's not gonna freak out anymore.
[38:21.18]How do I get that?
[38:33.05]Hmm.
[38:36.45]You should put it in your butthole.
[38:48.65]It's late.
[38:49.55]I didn't mean to read that one.
[38:56.37]Alright, so where can I do with this now?
[39:10.78]I don't place it here, right?
[39:18.57]You have an uncanny ability to seek out the worst of us.
[39:32.40]Whoa, this guy is interested in this item.
[39:35.57]My God!
[39:36.67]You shouldn't have touched that object.
[39:39.05]Misfortune is again our lot.
[39:41.97]Beware, you don't know what powers you are dealing with.
[39:45.46]It's Dracul.
[39:47.28]Dracul the Devil.
[39:50.24]Dracul?
[39:51.50]Is this in any way related to the Count?
[39:55.18]really leaning in okay
[40:23.79]What about you?
[40:26.03]Oh, you got something to say about this too.
[40:29.17]When I pulled the stones away in the cemetery, I found a strange ring.
[40:33.41]A mysterious blue light was pointing right to the spot.
[40:37.23]Did you see blue flames?
[40:40.25]Blue flames only appear on nights when the demons have broken their chains.
[40:44.81]Tonight, no man in this region will dare brave the outdoors, even if the flames pointed to a spot with a buried treasure.
[40:52.16]Buried treasure?
[40:54.58]Whoa!
[41:25.51]She's scarier than Dracula, I'm telling you.
[41:30.24]Okay, so... Now what do we do?
[41:33.76]Is the bridge banned with this?
[41:50.59]Maybe he gets scared of it?
[42:00.92]Go away and don't come back.
[42:07.07]Go away and don't come back.
[42:11.63]Maybe the the tough guy.
[42:12.77]I don't think I can do it with anything with the tough guy.
[42:24.56]Yeah, you definitely have to hit that guy.
[42:26.66]That guy you dropped the chandelier in his head.
[42:28.31]I gotta cut it, but I need the knife in the cemetery.
[42:33.43]So I need to dig out that.
[42:36.63]Who saved the game, you're right.
[42:44.30]How would I dig?
[42:45.04]That arm up.
[42:54.94]That big cross maybe.
[42:56.42]Oh, that's true.
[43:03.98]What is that?
[43:09.43]Is it a Lacus?
[43:13.57]Oh, here's this guy.
[43:15.37]Get away from this cabin!
[43:17.47]Otherwise, you'll have to answer to me!
[43:19.11]Oh, that's a good idea.
[43:22.91]Maybe the treehouse?
[43:24.41]I'm going to take a break here in a minute anyways, so... Okay.
[43:33.30]Can I...
[43:38.92]I'm going to hold doing this yet.
[43:40.98]I'm going to take a break.
[43:42.47]I'm going to get up.
[43:44.23]And we'll continue.
[43:44.97]This is nice.
[43:49.47]I like these later night streams.
[43:50.76]I like them.
[43:51.20]Alright, I'll be right back.
[43:54.86]Save the game.
[43:55.34]Ads are going to play.
[43:57.52]See you guys in a few minutes.
[44:00.04]Starting right now.
[44:24.79]Also, those wondering why the music is not playing right now.
[44:28.24]The volume on my desktop audio has to be pretty high for this.
[44:32.48]And if I alt tab the game crashes.
[44:36.03]Or if I hit the Windows key, the game crashes.
[44:38.79]So I can't really do very much.
[44:42.17]So just enjoy the enjoy the wind.
[44:44.51]I'm back.
[48:05.41]Making a key.
[48:05.80]I'll be back in a minute.
[49:07.55]We're good.
[49:14.44]And I didn't even need to alt-tab.
[49:15.76]I could hear you peeing.
[49:24.77]Well, I mean, I would hope so.
[49:26.83]I put the microphone directly into the toilet while I peed into it.
[49:29.69]I don't know why you wouldn't hear it.
[49:37.71]OK.
[49:39.49]So.
[49:41.63]Where we going?
[49:48.23]I was going to try this.
[49:52.52]That was such a good idea too.
[49:53.82]That's unfortunate.
[50:00.30]That was actually a great idea.
[50:13.05]What's the tea I'm rocking tonight?
[50:14.19]This is a ginger peppermint black pepper.
[50:19.12]It's pretty good.
[50:24.10]This is, I think, I've only had one or two cups of tea today, so all the people are thinking I'm a tea addict.
[50:32.96]There are worse things to be addicted to, okay?
[50:40.75]You could be addicted to crack.
[50:44.49]I think having a ginger tea once or twice a day is just fine.
[50:55.90]We fought wars over this stuff.
[50:57.82]Yeah, exactly.
[51:06.08]I think somebody just put the solution in the chat.
[51:11.83]It went by too fast though, so I don't know what it was.
[51:17.96]I saw go this take turn left go forward six paces.
[51:22.76]It was very specific and I think it was legitimate so.
[51:34.55]So if I was going to figure this out on my own.
[51:42.26]Who would want to see this thing?
[51:44.62]How would I get that arm out?
[51:51.89]Turn until you see a sign with the headstones pointing... Got deleted.
[51:55.85]Well, I got the first part.
[52:00.79]I cheated a tenth of the way.
[52:05.89]I saw a headstone, so I'm going back to the cemetery.
[52:21.79]Where the hell is the cemetery from here?
[52:31.16]I'm lost.
[52:33.06]OK, here we go.
[52:35.11]They need us pawns, pawns, then the cemetery.
[52:37.61]Right?
[52:42.37]God, what the hell?
[52:42.95]There we go.
[52:44.31]Alright, cemeterium.
[52:48.12]I could try this, but this is where the that crosses.
[52:50.10]Let's try this first.
[53:05.35]Tell us if you want a hint.
[53:08.91]Yeah, I. This seems more of like a ride I'd like to ride on rather than a puzzle game.
[53:16.05]But we'll see.
[53:27.01]Alright, so a headstone.
[53:28.26]Where did you look at a headstone?
[53:31.76]Is there a headstone of his headstone over here?
[53:40.93]It's not right here, right?
[53:43.09]Is it literally just right next to me?
[53:48.48]I don't think so.
[53:57.34]He doesn't learn.
[54:00.06]How am I supposed to be learning?
[54:21.76]Alright.
[54:24.04]Who's dropping the solution?
[54:35.37]Go back to the cross?
[54:36.53]Okay.
[54:42.07]Put the ring where it needs to go.
[54:46.65]Please speak to Gerard.
[54:47.87]Alright, I'll get this is an item apparently.
[54:51.67]OK, that's all I need to say.
[54:54.59]Who is Gerard?
[54:59.09]Yeah, I I can't look at my chat right now.
[55:01.25]I would love to.
[55:02.17]I am trapped on this screen because it'll crash the game if I leave this screen.
[55:09.31]The mods are probably all spamming me right now.
[55:11.13]Like dude, it's right here.
[55:12.51]There's like right where I don't know.
[55:17.15]Alright, well, that's good enough.
[55:17.95]How do I get out of here?
[55:23.85]OK.
[55:28.64]There's apparently an item over here somewhere.
[55:46.13]How would anybody have seen that?
[55:48.43]Let's be really honest.
[55:51.05]I never would have seen that.
[55:52.81]I never would have ever found this.
[55:55.81]I'm so glad somebody said that.
[55:59.00]There's no way.
[56:04.12]Well, okay, what is it?
[56:07.76]A piece of string?
[56:08.63]This is a slingshot.
[56:25.45]OK, I think I know what to do now.
[56:28.47]You go to the treehouse and you shoot at the bats with the slingshot and they'll come over and aggro and attack the guy.
[56:44.54]I don't know how anybody would have found that if I was playing this back when it came out and there's no guides.
[56:51.22]That would have been impossible.
[56:57.61]Alright.
[57:00.04]So... It's Lacus.
[57:03.46]We need to go to Lacus.
[57:05.72]It's right and then left.
[57:06.66]I gotta memorize this stuff.
[57:18.59]Here we go.
[57:22.52]Yep.
[57:38.01]Okay, so... Can I go in the house now?
[57:41.39]You guys are all so weirdly distractible.
[57:53.98]Got it.
[57:54.30]Alright, good.
[57:57.96]Can I walk up behind him and snap his neck?
[58:16.16]What do I do?
[58:16.64]I can't... I can't go anywhere and I can't go... I can't do anything.
[58:20.74]Door knob him.
[58:24.23]Axe against the wall?
[58:28.57]Oh shit.
[58:37.98]His eyes... We're going in two different directions.
[58:49.32]Got him.
[59:04.41]I just killed that guy.
[59:07.33]That started off as a cartoon knock the guy out thing.
[59:10.65]That guy's drowning in there.
[59:11.79]Nice.
[59:12.79]Look at that.
[59:15.23]Got the knife.
[59:22.03]We know what to do with that.
[59:33.64]Can't get in here.
[59:41.53]Door knobble.
[59:44.17]Cool.
[59:52.37]Can't do anything here.
[59:53.09]Alright, let's see.
[60:00.16]How are we going to distract this guy?
[60:01.28]I don't have anything to put in.
[60:02.60]Maybe I do.
[60:14.27]Okay, here we go.
[60:39.42]Now what?
[60:43.54]He's not running over here anymore.
[60:49.25]I think I softlocked the game.
[60:59.81]Is it actually softlocked?
[61:03.53]He only hates pickaxes.
[61:05.15]There's an item in the cabin.
[61:11.39]What happens if I cut this?
[61:22.42]So wait, why would the pickaxe make him run over here?
[61:25.52]Unless that was a bug.
[61:26.36]I don't think you need the item.
[61:37.34]There was something in the cabin where I drowned that guy.
[61:48.73]Save the game.
[61:49.33]Oh, you're right.
[61:56.36]Back to the cabin.
[61:57.02]OK.
[62:03.28]So just go to the cabin and yeah, I'm OK with taking little hints.
[62:10.82]Like I said, we mainly think along for the ride here, not necessarily to.
[62:15.66]bang my head against a wall for four hours trying to figure out... look at the ground and find the gray item on the gray ground for an hour, you know?
[62:25.52]Alright, so we'll take it back there.
[62:28.10]So there's an item here.
[62:46.07]Yes, there is.
[62:46.65]Flute?
[62:49.51]So do I play a flute and distract him?
[62:51.49]Why would he get mad at a pickaxe?
[62:55.45]I think that the item was in the directory.
[63:02.08]I think it was named the same thing in the directory.
[63:04.14]That's why he reacted to it the same way.
[63:10.85]he just hates Minecraft that's true too I mean who doesn't hate Minecraft though isn't that that's one of the most um one of the lowest rated games of all time right next to et
[63:37.11]Did you know that this instrument belonged to the men who shoved you as they left?
[63:41.72]Be careful.
[63:42.60]They mustn't find you with the flute, or you'll be in very serious trouble.
[63:46.98]I wonder what they used this instrument for.
[63:51.86]One day, when I was in the attic, I saw them near the bridge.
[63:56.15]One man played a melody, and another man showed up directly.
[64:00.89]I don't know whether they saw me, but they left right after that.
[64:06.60]Well, that guy's dead, so I don't have to worry about anything.
[64:13.57]So he thought it was the flute.
[64:17.89]I see.
[64:19.25]It's the flute belonging to the ruffians who were sitting there earlier.
[64:22.69]Do you know what they use this instrument for?
[64:25.50]You still have a lot to learn about the servants of evil.
[64:29.66]They use it to call each other.
[64:32.24]They communicate with one another by playing a melody.
[64:36.51]Then that's the rallying cry.
[64:38.69]Do you know what melody they play?
[64:40.15]I watched them.
[64:41.47]Give me some goofy shit.
[64:42.74]They weren't paying attention to me.
[64:44.84]They thought I was drunk, but it takes more than a dozen drinks to befuddle my brain.
[64:50.22]I remember the tune they used to call one another.
[64:53.44]Here it is.
[64:54.06]You just put your mouth all over it, man.
[65:02.76]What was the last time you brushed your teeth?
[65:12.70]I found this slingshot at the foot of the cross.
[65:14.88]A slingshot is very practical.
[65:17.72]You can always count on it when you're hunting or poaching.
[65:21.40]Me, I hunt birds near the lake.
[65:23.78]You can see them up in the big old oak tree.
[65:26.92]There are always plenty of birds there.
[65:29.66]There was also a bird on the cross.
[65:32.66]It had been crucified.
[65:34.50]Ah, the fiends!
[65:36.24]I'm sure it was Viorel and his men.
[65:39.75]They're Dracula's infernal minions.
[65:42.38]They're bloodthirsty brutes.
[65:44.50]Me.
[65:45.50]I hunt for my food.
[65:47.14]But them, they kill for their sacrifices.
[65:49.86]But what devil do they serve?
[65:52.16]They disappeared for a while, but recently they have come back.
[65:55.21]Alright.
[65:59.31]Well, let's go do it.
[66:09.18]What a rallying cry, by the way.
[66:11.64]Oh, trackless minions.
[66:13.08]They're terrible people.
[66:14.47]They're awful.
[66:15.93]And what they do is they play this terrible song to call each other.
[66:19.57]Okay, that's not that scary.
[66:25.57]That's not very menacing.
[66:34.33]Give it a try.
[66:34.71]There he is.
[66:41.37]It's the same animation.
[66:44.39]He was just missing his cue.
[66:45.15]He's just hearing things.
[66:53.54]Alright, now let's drop this on his head.
[67:01.14]That's a kill shot.
[67:17.04]So do I tell them I did that or do I just let them find them tomorrow?
[67:29.14]Hitman absolution.
[67:30.36]Uh-oh.
[67:37.54]Okay.
[67:37.74]Ooh, I can come out here now.
[68:16.82]That's it?
[68:23.64]His body is gone.
[68:25.23]Wait, I can't... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[68:26.73]I got kicked out!
[68:31.54]I actually got kicked out.
[68:33.18]I can't go back in.
[68:51.73]I'm writing my review right now.
[68:56.21]Hospitality 2.
[69:01.48]Food 3.
[69:07.30]What the fuck?
[69:17.78]Who's this?
[69:19.32]OK, well, I can't go that way.
[69:33.78]Got him in the barrel?
[69:36.70]No.
[69:38.98]We've not been this far.
[69:40.22]This is a huge progress here.
[69:41.88]Are you serious?
[70:01.49]Run the other way.
[70:07.97]That's not even a big deal.
[70:09.11]Okay, the McDonald's play place has a harder obstacle course than this.
[70:19.28]Are you serious?
[70:22.62]I could make that jump.
[70:30.12]So now what?
[70:30.84]What am I supposed to do now?
[70:35.69]That's absolute dog shit!
[70:39.03]No progress.
[70:41.37]Okay.
[70:46.13]And I'm kicked out of the inn.
[70:47.27]I'm not allowed to go back in the inn.
[70:51.19]I stink at this.
[71:03.71]Save.
[71:06.54]Good call.
[71:12.66]You make that jump and you'll take a break from streaming for five years.
[71:23.50]Sorry, I'm sitting on a couch.
[71:29.98]My keyboard was on over here.
[71:32.24]Okay, there we go.
[71:33.76]Alright, I'm saved.
[71:37.40]The reason that took so long is because my keyboard was not near me.
[71:45.76]Alright, so what's the plan now?
[72:05.31]Kill the rest of them.
[72:12.18]This is blocked.
[72:14.00]And so is this now.
[72:15.71]So what do I do?
[72:26.92]Back to the cemetery?
[72:48.35]Did you really shave your head?
[72:50.71]That was a different guy.
[72:55.60]That was Ludwig.
[73:09.70]I don't even think he looks that bad, by the way.
[73:11.88]I think he looks fine.
[73:15.66]I mean, okay.
[73:19.10]If he would stop doing the picture where he leans in and he pushes his chin down and just, like, juts out his forehead veins and stuff, that's why you don't like it.
[73:35.00]If he did, like, the Rizzler face with a filter on, you'd be like, oh, okay.
[73:40.66]It's because he does the, like, squished face.
[73:42.94]Like, I'm just a forward-facing camera that's too close.
[73:49.39]I think it looks fine.
[73:58.32]Now, if I went bald... That is... That is something that we don't want.
[74:04.73]Uh...
[74:08.15]me being bald a lot of you guys are oh wow Jerma your hair look at you look wow you look look at he looks like he's from uh like a prince from the renaissance period because I got this long hair you will change your tune really quickly I turn into a British henchman and I would turn into one of the ugly British henchmen I'm talking about the one that um uh what's his name there
[74:37.47]Oh my God, I can't even think of his name.
[74:41.05]I'm like a guy in a Jet Li movie that gets like kicked in the face through the glass window.
[74:46.13]My head's wicked bumpy.
[74:47.17]I got a rocky nose.
[74:48.49]I've got like a big chin.
[74:49.93]I got a skinny face.
[74:51.13]Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[74:53.01]No.
[74:57.15]That would never work ever.
[75:02.46]That's why if I ever go full bald, I'm just getting a toupee.
[75:05.18]I don't even care.
[75:06.62]And people could even talk about it.
[75:09.06]Because I'd be like, yeah, look what it is without it.
[75:11.03]And I'd jump scare them.
[75:12.35]They'd scream.
[75:19.25]I'm going to get a wicked shit toupee.
[75:31.95]What do I actually do here?
[75:39.04]The knocked out henchman?
[75:41.12]His body wasn't there anymore.
[75:42.20]How can I get out of here?
[76:05.84]His body, where is his body?
[76:16.18]Yeah, I got up and left.
[76:17.21]Around the end.
[76:45.20]A guy standing in the path.
[76:46.04]Yeah, I can't interact with that guy in the path.
[76:47.94]I think he's one of the henchmen.
[76:53.63]Um, wait, wait, what?
[76:58.23]This is where that was?
[76:59.97]I thought it was over there.
[77:04.25]Am I crazy or was that way over there to the other side?
[77:07.53]Nice.
[77:11.14]Wait, we got body.
[77:16.92]OK, so I got a key I I now what do I do with this key?
[77:24.77]He came out of that room a minute ago.
[77:28.71]Yeah, I'm just a fucking idiot, I think.
[77:34.31]Who I know what that key is for.
[77:39.42]Yep.
[77:41.58]Let's go.
[77:52.37]It's kind of messed up.
[77:53.19]I don't want to be in here.
[78:04.26]I want to do the funny cartoon stuff where you bonk people on the head and... Huh?
[78:20.13]What's that?
[78:25.41]Ahhhh.
[78:26.81]I think I can light the candles now.
[78:32.97]What am I looking at here?
[78:38.51]Dude, I took a nap after the Monster Hunter stream and I thought you wouldn't stream until the next day.
[78:42.90]So when I woke up, I thought a whole day went by.
[78:47.14]What, that you slept for 16 hours?
[78:48.18]Hahaha.
[78:55.66]Yeah, that would be pretty jarring, especially because... You don't ever trust a thing I ever say, you know?
[79:02.33]I always say that 95% of everything I ever say is not true.
[79:06.79]Really, just start believing me.
[79:08.23]Because... You know what's really weird?
[79:13.39]I am a negative... I don't know.
[79:18.78]When I say things are not going to happen, they just happen the next day.
[79:28.64]Every time I say I'm going to do something, it doesn't happen or it'll happen in three months.
[79:35.42]So I need to start telling you guys I'm not going to do things.
[79:44.40]Because then I'll just do it tomorrow.
[79:49.02]Alright, I got the fire now.
[79:49.90]I don't want to miss anything in here though.
[79:52.48]So wait a minute, that means you're going to go bald.
[80:01.57]the hell is that ascii art what the fuck was that oh that's that's that I see that in poke stream all the time yeah nothing's more jarring by the way of like I'm gonna watch some people like who's on Twitch right now oh there's a poke uh northern lions live oh yeah what are they doing what's ludwig up to what's Ster up to what's Etalyx up to
[80:27.01]What's going on in Only Fangs, right?
[80:28.79]And then you just come across a chat room and then you see ASCII art of your own face.
[80:32.42]Alright, so I don't want to miss an item.
[80:50.53]Yep, exactly.
[80:51.39]There's probably something on this wall.
[81:06.34]Did I ever tell my Northernlion auto dog story?
[81:12.67]It's a good one.
[81:18.02]Okay, so, Otto... Oh my god.
[81:21.67]Alright, get me out of here.
[81:23.19]Alright, so Otto... Me and Holly put on... Videos for dogs and cats.
[81:32.30]Just because we're just memeing.
[81:33.38]We're just messing around, right?
[81:34.72]So... A dog and cat video!
[81:37.52]Dogs love these videos!
[81:39.50]And Otto would start whining.
[81:42.08]Like, I don't like that.
[81:43.72]I don't like that.
[81:44.16]It's like, oh, he doesn't like that.
[81:46.16]If we put on Northernlion, he settles down and goes right to sleep.
[81:51.54]And he's just, wow, yeah, this is perfect.
[81:54.18]I'm not kidding.
[81:55.88]Otto loves Northernlion streams.
[82:00.03]It relaxes him.
[82:01.35]It makes him feel good.
[82:02.77]I'm not kidding.
[82:05.51]We'll put on other videos and he's like, no, no, get these off.
[82:15.73]You could ask Holly, I swear to God.
[82:25.98]OK, so hopefully I can light that candle now, which is how do I get back up into the house?
[82:43.29]So you're saying that Northernlion streams put you to sleep.
[82:45.43]No, no, no.
[82:45.95]Northernlion streams, uh, put my dog to sleep.
[82:49.33]I am very attentive to them.
[82:57.10]This is a huge difference.
[83:02.90]Jerma's dog is Northernlion-pilled.
[83:11.06]We did it in, I actually, we may have even recorded it, by the way.
[83:16.21]I'm gonna, when I, when Holly is back, I'm gonna ask her.
[83:20.67]Because we may have had a video of him upset at the dog and cat anti-stress video.
[83:27.82]And then we switched to Northernlion.
[83:30.52]And he just was like, yup.
[83:32.10]And he got comfortable.
[83:45.99]So what do I do with this?
[83:46.87]Because I can't get back in here.
[83:57.33]But the candle is in the inn.
[84:01.03]Do I bring the candle somewhere else?
[84:07.86]Did anybody see a place where I could put it?
[84:18.02]Yeah, I could go in the basement, but I can't get back in the inn.
[84:26.73]I can't climb up here.
[84:27.77]I need a ladder or something to grab onto.
[84:31.37]How do I get back up here?
[84:42.86]The well had some pretty dark spots down there, did it?
[84:57.43]I thought that was a person that just scared the shit out of me.
[85:02.85]Where's the well?
[85:03.81]I've already forgot where it is.
[85:04.75]Shit.
[85:10.64]Where's that well?
[85:11.20]I forgot.
[85:27.74]This is the key to the cabin.
[85:30.74]Where the dude was knocked out.
[85:37.56]Now you're onto something.
[85:47.33]Alright, so there's a place to go down here that was dark?
[85:49.13]I mean, it's pretty dark right here.
[86:05.07]Hmm.
[86:12.57]I don't think so.
[86:13.27]Oh, wait a minute.
[86:23.46]This is pretty dark, but I can't.
[86:26.90]Really?
[86:27.24]Come on.
[86:33.10]Really?
[86:39.31]That's a bunch of crap right there.
[86:41.85]And I don't want to get vulgar or anything, but that was a bunch of a bunch of malarkey.
[86:49.82]Something is definitely there.
[86:51.00]Why would it be able to walk over here?
[87:01.41]Stop, stop, stop.
[87:03.67]Guys, I've said this before.
[87:07.05]My channel over the last few years has gone a lot more PG-13 and PG.
[87:11.29]I'm not the G-rated streamer that everybody knows me as and knew me for a few years ago.
[87:24.36]And I'm probably going to lose people.
[87:26.89]But that's just the way it is.
[87:32.75]I don't take crap anymore.
[87:34.85]Yep.
[87:39.14]This is showing me something that I definitely need to remember.
[87:41.58]What is this showing me?
[87:53.81]I'm not going to be watching you anymore?
[87:57.87]Yeah, well, shove it.
[88:22.79]There's the one the one cultist Andy.
[88:26.61]I still love you.
[88:27.81]I don't know how to get back in there and I don't know where to go so.
[88:41.79]I'm willing to hear a a small.
[88:45.27]Tiny hint.
[89:05.78]Wait, a magnifying glass popped up on the dark spot.
[89:08.27]Wait, what?
[89:23.29]What the?
[89:23.97]What?
[89:24.49]Who is going to do this?
[89:27.81]Nobody's going to even see that.
[89:34.29]Okay.
[89:38.74]I have a hook or an anchor or what is that for?
[89:41.49]Okay, you know that if somebody is looking at the part of the game where it was dark here and I needed to do it, I couldn't see that I had to put it there.
[90:01.18]Where's the yellow paint?
[90:05.00]This should be yellow paint here.
[90:08.40]yellow paint here yellow paint here and then an arrow on the ceiling pointing straight down there okay so I what what is that what do I do with that
[90:39.42]Okay.
[90:40.24]Ooh, wait, can I make this now?
[90:44.99]Why not?
[90:45.51]I can't do some Legend of Zelda bullshit and just throw this over here?
[91:06.26]Okay, you did not need to use this to do that.
[91:11.30]This is six feet off the ground.
[91:14.38]I could climb up this without a single problem.
[91:22.09]I don't need a grappling hook to climb six feet.
[91:29.37]Is this even?
[91:30.05]This might even be five and a half.
[91:31.51]This might be 5.6 inches.
[91:37.05]Alright, we made it back.
[91:38.35]Finally, we made it back into the house.
[91:41.79]I've got the key now to the cupboard.
[91:48.18]The only place I can think to use it.
[91:58.08]Someone's gonna be dead down here.
[91:59.57]Dracula's gonna be sucking somebody's blood.
[92:09.42]No, you're all just still chilling.
[92:10.72]Okay.
[92:13.06]You gonna put any more of my items in your mouth?
[92:17.26]The bridge has just collapsed.
[92:18.92]Is there another way up to the castle?
[92:21.20]The bridge is down?
[92:23.98]I'm sorry.
[92:25.14]That's the only path that goes to the castle.
[92:28.59]Except perhaps... Do you know of another way?
[92:34.00]The old people say that there's an underground passage leading to the castle, but that's just a tall tale.
[92:41.61]If there's a passage, no one knows where the entrance is.
[92:45.13]Why is this guy being so sassy and flirty?
[92:49.03]What was that?
[92:51.75]He's giving me the blinking eyes.
[92:54.93]What the hell was that all about?
[92:58.93]I don't see how I can reach the castle.
[93:00.83]My time is short.
[93:01.69]Please help me.
[93:03.55]There are a lot of old legends in this region.
[93:07.03]The castle is said to be built with stones pried from the mountains by thousands of men who died for their labors.
[93:15.18]The old people say that the mountain is riddled with tunnels haunted by the souls of the damned.
[93:20.78]Whoever dares to brave the mountain is a fool.
[93:24.60]I have no choice.
[93:25.56]My wife's life depends on it.
[93:26.80]I must go.
[93:28.40]May God protect you on your mission.
[93:32.16]Okay, so I gotta get into the house.
[93:33.74]What about you?
[93:34.34]Do you have anything to say?
[94:02.56]The bridge has collapsed.
[94:03.98]It was very hard for me to get back to the inn.
[94:06.68]You must help me find another path to the castle.
[94:09.50]Virel is furious.
[94:11.02]I had to lock the doors of the inn to escape his anger.
[94:13.39]I think he's convinced that we're helping you.
[94:15.71]I'm so afraid.
[94:17.91]What is to become of us?
[94:19.51]I need you more than ever now.
[94:21.33]How can I possibly get out of the inn and reach the castle?
[94:24.62]If there's no other way, I will have to confront Virel.
[94:27.50]Too much is at stake.
[94:29.58]No.
[94:31.17]I cannot let him harm you.
[94:33.73]Those people have made a pact with the devil.
[94:37.15]There is no way you can win.
[94:39.21]No way.
[94:41.69]I thought it was going to be Saint Peter.
[94:45.12]A few days before he died, my late husband told me about a passage through the cellar.
[94:51.00]Hurry.
[94:51.68]Time is short.
[94:52.64]Show me.
[94:54.02]Alas, I never knew what he was talking about.
[94:57.76]But he seemed so frightened, so ill.
[95:01.66]you may find some clues in his notebook I put it away in the cupboard but I beg of you be careful whatever is down there that is what killed my husband somebody said I'm doing YouTuber commentary yeah alright well I have another key now so it's fine
[95:37.71]Where's the cow?
[95:42.63]After weeks of searching, I have finally understood the purpose of the dragon ring.
[95:47.27]The ring is a key, a key to hell, to the world of the dragon, and the door to that world is just below us.
[95:54.03]I must hurry.
[95:54.91]I must protect my family.
[95:56.67]I have blocked off the passage and hidden the cursed ring in the spot where St.
[96:00.75]George protects the living and the dead.
[96:03.30]In the name of all the saints, may that door remain forever locked.
[96:06.98]Did you just look like Peter Griffin for one second?
[96:08.60]This is a Peter Griffin character.
[96:10.81]Remember the time when I was in the inn and I was serving drinks where Dracula showed up?
[96:14.94]That's a Peter Griffin dressed up as a bar maid.
[96:20.01]It was there for one second.
[96:22.06]After weeks of searching, I have finally understood the purpose of the dragon ring.
[96:26.72]The ring is a key to hell, to the world of the dragon, and the door to that world is just below us.
[96:33.47]I must hurry.
[96:34.37]I must protect my family.
[96:36.13]I have blocked off the passage and hidden the cursed ring in the spot where St.
[96:40.21]George protects the living and the dead.
[96:42.75]In the name of all the saints, may that door remain forever locked.
[96:46.45]Our lives depend on it.
[96:56.26]OK, I'm ready to confront the demons in the darkness.
[97:09.15]Nice.
[97:09.47]Alright, here we go.
[97:29.56]I just don't want to miss an item.
[97:33.06]Just in case.
[97:33.60]I don't know.
[97:34.30]There could be something in here I need.
[97:35.34]You mean Peter Family Guy or Peter Bible?
[97:45.96]Uh, I... Peter... Hold on.
[97:52.94]Zip.
[97:56.78]I gotta put the Satan key in here.
[98:08.93]Uh-oh, I gotta put that thing in there.
[98:11.71]Save.
[98:13.37]This could get ugly.
[98:26.01]Oh, whoops.
[98:41.34]Thank you.
[99:12.94]I like the sound in this game.
[99:38.98]Blocked off.
[99:39.64]I don't have anything I can do with this, right?
[99:47.70]I don't think so.
[99:48.44]Can I look inside of this?
[100:03.86]You guys all enjoying the World of Warcraft stream?
[100:09.12]But I'm all over the place lately.
[100:12.72]I'm all over the place.
[100:16.23]It's just it's total chaos right now.
[100:18.24]I like I don't know what's going on here.
[100:20.24]Nobody see anything.
[100:38.78]But I'm one of those people that likes chaos and I actually do well in chaos and not necessarily order.
[100:44.65]When things are order, I don't really do that well.
[100:47.57]I actually really do well in chaos.
[100:49.53]And I hate to talk like that because you hear the tone of my voice and I'm doing a mocking tone.
[100:56.48]But I think it's accurate.
[100:59.60]Again.
[101:24.61]I'm sorry, I farted into the microphone.
[101:29.80]That was... That may have... That was what that was.
[101:35.18]Some developer is, uh... Because as a sound engineer, you can really take anything and make it anything.
[101:45.59]Well, here we go.
[101:50.31]Wait.
[101:52.41]Wait, no, no, no.
[101:53.51]I don't want to be here.
[101:54.77]This just don't be bad.
[101:59.30]Now I'm locked out of this place.
[102:00.48]I thought we were going to go to Dracula's lair.
[102:08.38]I love how he's looking that way now.
[102:17.59]He just doesn't see me.
[102:24.16]I guess I could just keep going.
[102:27.17]The cabin, right?
[102:28.51]Oh, no, this is what I was supposed to do.
[102:31.31]Oh.
[102:33.07]Oh, that's right.
[102:34.13]And then, oh.
[102:50.34]He sounds so fake all the time.
[102:55.30]Shit.
[102:57.18]Is that a new viewer?
[103:00.78]Is that a newish viewer?
[103:03.90]Oh, OK.
[103:06.78]95% of the things they say just aren't true.
[103:10.28]So you're right.
[103:12.29]You have every right to say that.
[103:20.96]The Prince of Lies?
[103:21.84]Alright.
[103:25.28]Let's take a BRB.
[103:28.22]I'm gonna have another tea.
[103:31.83]Can you have too much tea?
[103:33.97]I've only had two today.
[103:34.81]I'll just have some water, maybe.
[103:42.53]By the way, I apologize about that sound.
[103:44.13]It kind of just happens sometimes, and hopefully it's not too bad.
[103:57.73]Yeah, that one.
[103:58.11]They'll go.
[103:58.51]Alright.
[104:00.04]See you guys in a few minutes.
[104:03.13]Ads will start playing.
[104:04.71]See you in a few minutes.
[107:27.94]Also, hello, welcome back.
[107:30.63]Does that sound been happening the entire time and I just just just blend it in with the game in my brain?
[107:50.37]Is it?
[107:54.39]Yeah, that like that.
[108:17.85]Okay, well, uh, let me save it.
[108:24.73]It's been the entire time.
[108:32.20]Oh shit.
[108:32.78]Well, hopefully that's not been like brain numbing.
[108:35.44]I, I've, I haven't really noticed it either.
[108:36.92]Ooh.
[108:54.67]What did that do?
[108:55.23]Oh, we're going in the elevator to hell.
[109:03.01]Oh boy.
[109:30.96]If I'm not, uh, gel, there's no way.
[109:45.93]Interesting.
[109:51.73]So this is hell?
[109:59.65]I mean, I only went down a few hundred feet.
[110:02.47]I don't know.
[110:03.55]Yeah, hell's a little further down.
[110:05.12]Where is hell?
[110:08.44]Where's hell?
[110:17.43]Not on Earth?
[110:19.29]Well, how come we always synonymize it with down?
[110:22.57]Oh, we're going down.
[110:23.45]Oh, we don't want to go down there.
[110:26.09]Where is down?
[110:26.61]What do you mean down?
[110:28.59]The sky is supposed to be heaven.
[110:30.07]Down is supposed to be hell.
[110:31.87]What's down?
[110:32.55]There's no sky down.
[110:36.26]There's just dirt and mantle and lava and shit.
[110:49.82]Did I just kill myself?
[110:54.61]Um, was I not supposed to do that?
[110:58.11]No, I got out of it.
[111:11.12]Hey, nice job, Ernest.
[111:16.14]That's a good one.
[111:19.32]That was a that was actually an earnest thing to do.
[111:30.32]Ernest goes to hell.
[111:31.66]Didn't we talk about that?
[111:32.64]That was going to be a movie that was made or is it a movie?
[111:37.13]I don't remember.
[111:37.55]There's this 15 Ernest movies.
[111:53.89]It's not.
[111:55.01]You gave it to us for homework.
[111:56.05]Did you complete your assignment?
[112:01.91]Can we get a poll in the chat?
[112:03.69]Did you complete your assignment?
[112:05.69]Did you watch at least three of the eight Ernest movies?
[112:14.37]Did you see at least three Ernest movies yet?
[112:18.99]No.
[112:27.81]Did something drop from this or something?
[112:29.83]I don't get it.
[112:33.48]Can't really do anything.
[112:34.24]Am I trapped down here forever?
[112:35.78]I didn't actually softlock myself down here, did I?
[112:56.06]You think the debris would have something, right?
[112:58.84]I guess not.
[113:33.05]I can't grab this or something.
[113:34.39]No, I can't touch it.
[113:41.76]Can I count the commercials?
[113:44.08]Only if you've seen 30 of them because there was at least two or 300 probably.
[113:57.97]I might be screwed here.
[114:13.54]Bro, what is an earnest film?
[114:16.42]Oh, wow.
[114:17.18]Can you imagine, guys, having the whole earnest catalog?
[114:20.83]86% of you did not do your homework?
[114:26.83]This is when the teacher comes in and is just flabbergasted and can't believe it.
[114:32.21]That's unbelievable.
[114:33.19]86% of you.
[114:42.28]Here we are OK finally.
[114:44.84]Look at the one pixel that I can do this on.
[114:47.84]Well, that's way more than one.
[114:48.92]OK, those who I like that.
[115:20.47]It's lecture yapping time.
[115:28.64]Break these up, right?
[115:35.00]I think that's the husband.
[115:38.44]That sound effect.
[115:44.36]That's... That's the sound effect in... Everything.
[115:49.58]I've heard it everywhere.
[115:50.92]Where have I heard that sound?
[115:52.76]SpongeBob.
[115:53.62]Yeah.
[115:58.79]I think that's it.
[116:10.48]Ew.
[116:15.02]So now what?
[116:28.35]What is all this?
[116:29.09]Heaven is generally seen as above and... Oh, oh, oh.
[116:32.31]I wish I could read what you just wrote, but I cannot scroll over to the other monitor because it'll crash the game.
[116:39.96]Somebody gave the entire explanation as to why it's up and down.
[116:43.40]Heaven and hell.
[116:49.58]Heaven and hell is Earth.
[116:50.52]Did I change clothes?
[116:58.08]Why am I wearing a tuxedo now?
[116:59.30]I look like a waiter.
[117:21.36]Okay, I can go right, go straight across, or... Nothing here.
[117:33.29]Hmm.
[117:50.33]How am I getting the cutscene again?
[118:04.44]What's the name of the game?
[118:05.14]I don't even know.
[118:08.86]Dracula?
[118:10.52]Dead and loving it?
[118:29.56]Alright, what am I missing here?
[118:42.89]We have seen Dracula once in the very beginning.
[118:44.91]He bit a lady.
[118:47.79]And he was in a loot box.
[118:50.95]Somebody opened a legendary Dracula.
[118:53.03]And then they killed him.
[118:54.83]And that's the first... We haven't seen him since.
[119:05.56]Oh, hold on.
[119:06.12]No, I need another item of some kind.
[119:13.02]I don't know what to... Okay, well, I can wrap around, so... Oh!
[119:25.75]I can take his arm.
[119:26.63]Maybe that'll do it.
[119:30.17]Oh, goddammit.
[119:31.27]I have to do this again.
[119:32.83]Can I skip it?
[119:33.47]I can't even skip cutscene.
[119:50.86]When am I going to head to bed?
[119:51.68]I don't know.
[119:55.39]I'm good for a little while.
[119:56.21]I have been going to bed pretty early, but... I'm very invested.
[120:01.67]That's not what you do here.
[120:10.56]I thought you would put the arm out and grab the chain.
[120:17.46]Don't tell me I gotta do this again.
[120:18.56]There's another item.
[120:19.76]Oh my goodness.
[120:20.44]OK, we have to do this again.
[120:23.02]I can't even see that I can see the chat, but I can't see how many people are even here.
[120:26.36]This is the latest I've streamed in a long time.
[120:29.48]10,000 11,000 damn.
[120:40.03]At late.
[120:40.43]I think we're getting the late night crowd here.
[120:43.01]Hey, the late night crowd is always pretty chill.
[120:47.54]I will say late night crowd has been.
[120:51.24]Pretty pretty low key, so it's good.
[120:59.37]This barrel maybe now can go.
[121:01.19]I can't go over there.
[121:24.49]Maybe I can use the skeleton arm or something else here.
[121:33.37]It's going to be some weird, dumb thing.
[121:35.31]There's going to be something hanging on a ledge over here and I can only reach it with skeleton arm.
[121:43.98]Maybe you can use the skeleton arm to pick your nose.
[121:48.58]You mean what every dad does on Halloween with the skeleton prompt?
[121:55.46]Dad picks his own nose with it.
[121:59.80]That is a classic dad routine.
[122:04.27]And you're having a sleepover?
[122:07.43]Dad, get out of here!
[122:11.33]So embarrassing!
[122:12.51]Mom!
[122:32.96]Teenage girl.
[122:33.82]Now I was merely setting the scene.
[122:42.18]I was merely setting the scene.
[122:53.71]Just like the kid crying on the spinny carnival ride.
[122:56.37]Was that you?
[122:57.03]No, no, no.
[123:04.28]I was actually the one that wanted to have to go fast.
[123:09.95]The other people on the ride were telling me to... Hey, I don't want... We're going too fast.
[123:15.63]We're going too fast, son.
[123:18.81]No, son, I don't... Hold on a second.
[123:24.29]Son, please!
[123:25.72]The dad was, you know, the dad was crying for me.
[123:31.00]I flipped it.
[123:31.76]I flipped the script.
[123:40.17]How do I get out of here?
[123:49.08]OK, there we go.
[123:49.68]But what am I?
[123:50.66]What do I do?
[123:51.18]I need to use the skeleton arm.
[124:02.07]It's going to be something on the floor.
[124:03.41]At this game, I love this game's atmosphere.
[124:05.87]I actually think this game is very good.
[124:09.01]But there's going to be an object I can't see that I can only get with the skeleton arm, and I don't know where it is.
[124:18.60]Oh, I know it.
[124:20.34]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[124:22.00]I got it.
[124:22.70]I got it.
[124:23.10]I got it.
[124:23.42]I got it.
[124:23.74]I got it.
[124:24.20]You're right.
[124:24.58]You're right.
[124:24.90]You're right.
[124:28.30]I love this game, though.
[124:29.10]This is like everything I like.
[124:33.19]I'm so glad that I randomly picked this out of a list of three or four hundred games.
[124:41.28]Because it is oozing with charm.
[125:01.58]Oh, I can skip it.
[125:02.44]I can skip it.
[125:03.02]I can skip it.
[125:12.14]I almost did it again.
[125:12.92]Huh?
[125:24.71]What did I just pick up?
[125:27.79]Guys, we were all wrong.
[125:30.98]All of us.
[125:38.48]We all wanted to grab this.
[125:40.77]But again, there was... I don't even know what it was.
[125:47.57]It's apparently a... Is that kind of bar?
[125:52.01]Or can I hook it onto something?
[126:00.04]A shower curtain rod?
[126:03.74]The pull-up bar.
[126:06.76]Maybe I can use it here.
[126:09.20]Yep.
[126:10.00]Alright, when do we get to?
[126:14.35]When do we get to hell?
[126:38.57]All that to get to a gate that doesn't open.
[126:46.73]Are you serious?
[126:55.56]That's a dark soul shortcut door.
[126:57.50]If I've ever seen one.
[127:01.24]Another one.
[127:01.74]Not even I can't go through here.
[127:04.14]There's no.
[127:15.14]This is new.
[127:15.68]Am I in hell?
[127:24.96]Is this where Dracula eats his food?
[127:41.45]I hope this is Dracula's house.
[127:47.14]it's not a house I don't know cool looking
[128:35.46]barrels 666 Dracula what is the hell does Dracula own a mining company 666 Dr. does he own a bunch of property or something okay well I'm very interested I need to see this through
[129:05.66]I have no idea how long.
[129:06.88]This game could be 40 hours long and I have no idea.
[129:09.94]Or it could be 3 and we're almost at the end.
[129:11.96]There's really no way for me to tell.
[129:15.29]These games back then could either be 100 hours or 2.
[129:24.51]He's a count.
[129:25.21]That's true.
[129:36.88]What was this for?
[129:47.57]This gotta be something I can do in here, right?
[130:02.66]The world record is five minutes.
[130:18.70]We're about a fourth of the way through a guide I found.
[130:21.70]I would imagine it's probably seven to ten hours, I would imagine.
[130:26.26]Because how long have I been playing this so far?
[130:35.83]Two hours?
[130:36.31]Three hours?
[130:38.59]If I'm a fourth of the way through it, then it's probably about ten hours, yeah.
[130:46.71]I don't know what the hell's going on here.
[130:48.05]I can't really do anything.
[130:56.89]Hmm.
[131:01.02]Another suspicious dark alley, whatever this is.
[131:08.28]But you forgot you suck at games.
[131:11.76]You gotta give me an exception on this one.
[131:15.57]we all didn't understand the skeleton arm we all tried to grab the candle and it was a thing on the ground I don't really know the kind of course of action here I don't really
[131:46.48]I haven't seen anything to interact with.
[131:47.74]That's weirdly enough.
[131:48.64]I don't know why.
[131:51.54]You think one of these boxes or barrels or I don't?
[131:55.60]Save it.
[132:12.95]Luxury wall.
[132:16.67]Yeah, but what is this for?
[132:17.85]There's a lever?
[132:28.56]The lever.
[132:29.32]Where's a lever?
[132:30.62]You see a lever?
[132:35.43]Can I just not see this thing that you're talking about?
[132:37.59]Where is it?
[132:45.38]I can barely even see that.
[132:49.17]Nice.
[132:51.69]Get in it, dude.
[132:52.39]What are you?
[132:52.81]Why are you holding it like this?
[132:56.49]You want to get inside of that?
[133:04.67]He looks like he was carrying it.
[133:06.33]That was weird.
[133:09.21]Card is filthy.
[133:11.04]I would.
[133:11.82]Yeah, but you could die pretty easily.
[133:16.68]Alright, an oil can fell down.
[133:27.59]Where'd it go?
[133:28.05]I missed the old guy at the tavern, yeah.
[133:46.64]He's probably dead.
[134:01.51]What did that even do?
[134:02.23]Um, it's like a Jack.
[134:15.48]What is this for?
[134:18.60]Okay, this is... I gotta get something for that.
[134:24.38]Oil?
[134:38.41]There are yellow lines on that track.
[134:41.97]Yeah, it very clearly showed an oil drum falling down, but where is it?
[134:45.93]I don't see an oil drum anywhere.
[134:58.37]I just said, blah, blah, blah, blah, chat, blah, blah, blah.
[135:08.29]I don't even say chat, by the way.
[135:10.61]Ster was saying that a lot earlier.
[135:12.09]I don't say chat.
[135:14.24]I say you guys.
[135:15.52]I say, hey guys.
[135:17.98]I don't say chat.
[135:38.33]Actually, maybe I do.
[135:48.07]I think I swap it out.
[135:49.55]I interchange it.
[135:52.99]Yeah, I got no idea what I'm doing right now, by the way.
[135:55.67]It was an oil drum that fell down.
[135:57.04]I don't know where it is.
[135:59.36]I would like to climb up there or get up there, but I don't think I can even.
[136:05.37]The minecart crashed here.
[136:23.16]Alright, so I have to put an oil drum in this.
[136:37.97]Or I have to route the track, but I can't move this without.
[136:42.35]OK, what goes there?
[136:52.42]No.
[136:54.34]No.
[136:54.50]Alright, I'm missing an item that needs to go there.
[136:57.86]What goes here?
[137:02.69]On the right.
[137:05.67]Oil drum on the ground on the right.
[137:23.32]Might be a spring.
[137:26.86]It looks like there's an oedrome here.
[137:32.85]Doesn't look like there's an interaction.
[137:42.24]Maybe a hook.
[137:43.62]Yeah, a hook or a spring or a grabber or a... It has to be in this room.
[137:49.80]Yeah, it kind of does.
[137:58.06]This is a big ass door too.
[137:59.40]This is the door to hell.
[138:00.93]I at least want to get in here.
[138:04.57]That drum that fell was marked fuel.
[138:10.60]I think it needs to be over there.
[138:12.52]I think this has to be over there.
[138:16.76]Let me watch this cutscene again.
[138:27.74]Alright, the oil didn't fall this time.
[138:30.02]It was up there and it fell from here.
[138:36.71]Like, oh, wait a minute.
[138:37.55]Maybe go up?
[138:44.33]Wasn't there a spot I could look down?
[138:45.68]Hold on.
[139:03.78]Doesn't look out of the ordinary.
[139:15.79]Are you smoking salvia right now?
[139:17.61]You sound fucked up.
[139:20.54]You couldn't pay me any amount of money to smoke salvia.
[139:25.90]Yeah, I wouldn't do that for any amount of money.
[139:28.38]Ever.
[139:30.54]Never, ever, ever.
[139:31.58]Ever.
[139:36.44]And, by the way, stay away from that shit, okay?
[139:39.76]Where...
[140:08.69]Alright, I'm willing to accept.
[140:09.83]I'm exchanging one streamer token.
[140:14.17]To get a little bit of knowledge on this game.
[140:27.95]Gonna be something on the ground that I is is Gray.
[140:35.33]Yeah, I'm out of tokens.
[140:41.30]I have an infinite supply of tokens.
[140:45.91]Hey, you got an infinite supply of tokens when you're the bank.
[140:57.55]I need to find a hook item.
[141:03.91]It's going to be in such a weird, obscure spot that it's just nowhere to be found right now.
[141:22.45]I would think would be behind here.
[141:36.56]Inside the cart maybe.
[141:51.88]You're lying.
[141:52.75]I saw you in my salvia trip, so you did it too.
[141:55.65]God.
[142:03.48]There's... Okay, this is the... This is the cart right here.
[142:08.68]But there's nothing in it.
[142:09.90]I can get down here and I can push it back the other way and do the weird goofy animation again.
[142:14.23]But we've already seen it like 5,000 times.
[142:21.19]Is there anything in it?
[142:24.31]Look up.
[142:35.78]It's up there.
[142:40.18]Well, I got it.
[142:40.80]Okay.
[142:42.14]Should we send it back?
[142:55.56]The first cutscene did show it, to be fair.
[142:57.58]I was probably talking about dog food tier lists or something.
[143:02.44]I don't know.
[143:15.67]Okay, so there we go.
[143:16.43]It's a multiple item bullshit, isn't it?
[143:24.01]I gotta find something else.
[143:41.65]He's 100% high.
[143:43.27]Late night, Friday, Holly isn't home.
[143:48.31]Now, yes, all those things point to exactly that.
[143:52.25]You are, if you were a detective, I would say you are on the case, right?
[143:58.58]Like that, I am prime suspect for that.
[144:06.90]Try the lever again, but not clicked into it.
[144:26.00]I don't know, what does that do?
[144:43.58]And now, when I go the other way, it'll move the other direction.
[144:54.63]So I'll go straight now, right?
[144:58.44]There we go.
[145:00.40]Ooh.
[145:23.37]This is how you get inside.
[145:27.25]Did he do a riding rodeo riding cowboy thing there, by the way?
[145:31.74]Bro, sit down.
[145:39.25]Germs are not a big deal right now.
[145:41.61]Sit down.
[145:54.00]Doesn't want to get his suit wet.
[146:08.79]We only got it for one second, but that... I wish we got that longer.
[146:23.15]This is the cathedral of hell.
[146:27.76]Okay.
[146:43.39]Okay.
[146:55.50]According to the long play, this is about the halfway point.
[147:01.70]Interesting.
[147:03.60]I can't go down here.
[147:13.10]Making pretty good time then.
[147:17.09]Um, what time is it right now?
[147:19.95]11?
[147:20.37]It is getting kind of late.
[147:26.64]Hey, how about this?
[147:30.75]Oh, I feel so bad.
[147:31.65]Somebody said, hey, is he going to play WoW after this?
[147:35.35]I'm so sorry.
[147:38.48]How about this?
[147:42.72]We'll do this tomorrow.
[147:45.74]We will complete Dracula.
[147:48.59]Dead and loving it.
[147:52.04]I'm not done yet.
[147:52.68]I'm not leaving yet.
[147:54.38]I just know for a fact that we're not going to finish this tonight.
[147:56.72]There's no way.
[147:57.20]Or I'll just take another bong rip and rally.
[148:04.60]That's not how that works.
[148:09.10]Oh, actually, we're not going to do this tomorrow.
[148:13.61]This is not happening tomorrow.
[148:15.77]In fact, you're never ever going to see this ever again.
[148:20.81]There.
[148:22.39]That should fix it.
[148:26.75]I'm not done yet though.
[148:28.65]Maybe like another hour?
[148:29.81]Half hour?
[148:33.90]We'll see how I feel in like 25 minutes.
[148:53.62]Also, I'm trying to be smooth with the turning.
[148:57.00]Because the first person game like this with full 360 degree rotation, I can imagine could probably be.
[149:03.00]Rough on some of you.
[149:12.91]How do I?
[149:17.45]Well, it's very clearly something he oh.
[149:21.64]No.
[149:28.50]Am I just stuck down here?
[149:29.54]Is this the evil clone?
[150:04.02]Okay, well, I did it.
[150:15.45]Crazy room.
[150:27.69]Is there actually nothing in here?
[150:28.99]Oh.
[150:39.53]Can I load it?
[150:39.99]Alright, I got to load this.
[150:44.52]Ooh, wait, maybe this thing.
[150:46.12]Yep.
[150:56.22]What did that do?
[150:57.71]Hey.
[151:39.84]This game gets a... Oh, I can't go this way.
[151:42.24]This game gets a shitload of points because... It breaks up the point and click with goofy stuff like that.
[151:54.55]It actually is just enough to break up the monotony of walking around.
[152:08.93]Bats are here.
[152:09.57]I can't go forward.
[152:17.31]Do you still eat McDonald's?
[152:19.29]I really just really wish you didn't say that because I just want it so bad right now, but I can't eat it right now.
[152:28.52]I'm on a no McDonald's diet at the moment.
[152:42.72]That sounds great though.
[152:46.35]But no, I haven't had it in a while.
[152:51.17]Can I whack him with the crowbar?
[152:52.47]No, I can't.
[153:05.06]Take your Lambo to McDonald's.
[153:08.78]I don't.
[153:09.70]I don't have a Lamborghini.
[153:14.38]I got a little car.
[153:16.13]It just takes me where I want to go.
[153:17.37]There's another door?
[153:37.32]You drive?
[153:43.25]I... How many people here just think I am a non-functioning human?
[153:48.62]Like I... He doesn't drive and he can't... He can't read.
[153:51.72]Um... He... Uh... He eats Cap'n Crunch all day.
[153:58.66]I got my driver's license when I was 17.
[154:00.96]And I've had it ever since.
[154:03.20]I've been driving for like 25 years.
[154:07.90]And I've... I've got a clean record.
[154:10.55]I've got a good record on the road.
[154:27.89]Clones don't have social social security numbers.
[154:40.40]You don't have a butler or a chauffeur.
[154:45.72]I think having a butler would be weird.
[154:49.98]I think so.
[154:52.12]I don't want to.
[154:53.10]I don't want somebody standing around my house.
[154:58.17]I don't want somebody standing behind me.
[155:02.27]Just with a suit on.
[155:16.26]Alright, there's apparently another door here that I'm not seeing.
[155:20.80]I would feel bad.
[155:22.34]I wouldn't like that.
[155:24.97]oh yes what can I get you sir?
[155:27.73]you uh just grab me um I want a coke from the fridge thanks but I want it now yes sir thanks dude give it to me give me it's like oh I would feel bad I don't wanna I would feel I'd feel awful I'd feel so lazy and shitty
[155:50.19]Because I'm being judged.
[155:52.39]That butler is judging me.
[155:54.03]And I know it.
[155:55.91]I don't know how much I'm paying this butler.
[155:58.17]But even if he's getting paid really well.
[156:01.14]He's just like, wow, dude.
[156:02.72]He's probably like, this dude's an asshole.
[156:10.22]Like, can you shake that feeling of... Hey, dude, get me a Coke.
[156:15.70]Uh, no.
[156:15.96]No.
[156:18.63]I know that's like the job, but I would feel like a dick every time.
[156:27.12]I would only be comfortable with a butler if that butler... No, but dressed in regular clothes would be like, this is kind of a guy here now.
[156:36.64]I don't know.
[156:40.10]I don't think I couldn't do it.
[156:53.28]Yeah, bar, bar any form of, of, of disability or something for like a help.
[156:59.15]Just kind of a somebody in your house that just does whatever you tell them to do.
[157:04.03]Even if it means just kind of walking down the hall for a minute and then coming back with toilet paper.
[157:15.65]I've been in the same spot for 25 minutes.
[157:29.27]So a boyfriend?
[157:43.24]The role of a butler is not a simple servant.
[157:45.48]That's also true, though, and I think that we see these butlers as the guy that stands there with the food and, uh, your dinner, sir.
[157:52.56]And he lifts up the big metal thing, and it's a big dome, and there's a whole pig there.
[157:59.28]But yeah, Butler like manages your whole household.
[158:02.74]Right, yeah.
[158:03.62]Butler does a lot.
[158:08.26]Actually, that would be kind of sick.
[158:10.70]Somebody that took care of everything.
[158:19.23]Somebody just tell him what to do already.
[158:21.77]What am I missing here?
[158:29.59]Why did we get a double feature on that?
[158:32.35]I didn't click twice.
[158:43.40]Stand over the hole and look below you.
[158:44.83]The oil spilled.
[158:45.57]Maybe you can burn it.
[158:59.05]I don't get it.
[159:10.01]The butler could help you if you get stuck in games.
[159:20.65]There's nothing down here.
[159:22.41]I already did this.
[159:24.57]There's no other door or anything.
[159:33.45]right side by the wood I tried to kind of kind of go this way or this way am I just insane how am I not seeing this I have a crowbar of I think it's either kerosene or I haven't seen anything to touch or interact with that that's the only thing I can do maybe I should lower the lower the bridge again
[160:02.20]I've been talking, though.
[160:02.96]I haven't really been paying that much attention.
[160:04.70]I can still interact with this, can't I?
[160:22.59]It's nothing... I mean, it has to be something here.
[160:25.08]I can't leave, either.
[160:40.22]Is a lantern on the side of the track?
[160:46.80]Is it just is it just too dark on my screen?
[160:48.60]Because I can't see.
[160:49.48]Is it a look up scenario?
[161:08.28]You've looked at it like five times.
[161:12.59]Have I?
[161:13.95]Is my screen just too dark?
[161:31.24]Keep looking, keep looking.
[161:33.64]The hallway behind you.
[161:49.25]You're reading all the answers that aren't telling you the answer.
[161:55.06]Am I?
[162:02.54]It's on the floor by one of the pillars.
[162:06.28]What?
[162:07.72]Where?
[162:10.06]Under there.
[162:18.96]Dude, I don't see anything.
[162:23.32]I gotta turn my screen brightness up.
[162:39.67]I still can't even really see that.
[162:43.75]I'm not even allowed to pick it up.
[162:48.36]Alright, that should scare the bats.
[163:03.55]Okay, cool.
[163:03.99]I have a cool lantern now.
[163:19.47]Look at the oil down here.
[163:20.49]Alright, well, I'll come back and finish this.
[163:31.51]I'm going to take one more break.
[163:33.55]This will be the last break of the night.
[163:35.89]Use the lantern on it.
[163:45.02]I'll be right back.
[163:45.74]3-4 minutes.
[163:50.56]And I will get past this bridge.
[163:59.85]Ads are going to start.
[164:00.51]I'll see you guys in three minutes.
[166:15.48]Amen.
[167:14.00]okay five seconds somebody said okay they're back I want to talk to the person specifically that said uh hey um I got a bunch of ads somebody fill me in well you didn't miss anything you didn't miss anything
[167:49.10]Yeah, you missed it when I got attacked by the bats.
[167:54.26]Nobody said that?
[167:54.82]Yes, they did.
[167:57.17]Okay, so I got this lamp.
[168:09.31]Alright, so if I go this way and I look down... You guys say that there's this here, okay?
[168:22.41]Can't really aim it anywhere.
[168:25.07]Aiming at the bats or something?
[168:33.49]No, I am not inebriated at all.
[168:37.17]I am stone sober.
[168:41.19]I'm just chilling.
[168:41.85]This is my chill... time.
[168:48.06]Is the oil behind you?
[168:52.98]Is there oil somewhere behind me?
[168:56.76]It's not about this place in particular.
[168:58.11]I just cannot see any of the things that you guys are talking about.
[169:00.65]I mean, I see all that.
[169:15.09]Look down at the side of the rail from one of the edges of the pit.
[169:28.88]Wait, really?
[169:30.26]I couldn't do it from... I have to do it from this one spot?
[169:38.74]Oh my god.
[169:39.62]Okay.
[169:53.54]I don't feel as bad anymore.
[170:04.63]Yeah, just gotta find the right pixel.
[170:06.01]That's right.
[170:06.29]Alright, well, investigate.
[170:20.21]Did I tell you guys about how Holly and I played Baldur's Gate 3 and we only played for like a day or two?
[170:25.82]Because I let the vampire guy suck my blood like six times until he killed me and we just stopped playing after that?
[170:35.14]We never played it ever again.
[170:40.60]That was scary.
[170:46.55]I don't know if he was, like, coming on to me or what.
[170:49.29]He was like, oh, I would love to suck your blood tonight.
[170:52.43]And I was like, okay, fine.
[170:54.91]And I let him do it.
[170:56.69]And then I had an option to let him keep doing it.
[171:00.05]I said, keep doing it.
[171:01.97]And then it said, do you want him to keep doing it?
[171:03.55]I said, keep doing it.
[171:05.01]Do you want him to keep doing it?
[171:05.85]I said, keep doing it.
[171:06.71]And Holly's like, what are you doing?
[171:07.83]You're going to die.
[171:08.39]And I'm just like, just keep doing it.
[171:10.35]And the character died and we never played it again.
[171:17.86]That was the whole arc of that character.
[171:20.56]And it's so funny because it was a little gnome too.
[171:23.30]It was a gnome character.
[171:24.66]You're so stupid.
[171:34.41]I can't go this way.
[171:35.83]Yes, I can.
[171:36.33]I just had to be in the right spot.
[171:46.78]Did my mouse just change?
[171:47.80]I feel like it did.
[171:59.63]And now what?
[172:05.73]You can resurrect your main character?
[172:07.11]Yeah, but I kind of feel... I figured that was like the place to stop playing it.
[172:16.77]Where's the one item?
[172:18.42]Is this a rope here?
[172:19.54]Is this a hoe?
[172:20.98]Whatever that is.
[172:21.58]Bottle?
[172:30.11]No.
[172:33.77]That's the very beginning of the game.
[172:35.35]Yeah, I know.
[172:36.31]But was I going to get a better outcome than that?
[172:46.65]I can't pick the axe up, which is crazy.
[172:59.75]Well, OK, I guess I could go this way.
[173:14.04]Get in.
[173:22.90]I think we're gonna see him.
[173:39.69]Can I drown that guy?
[173:46.88]So, our young friend is going to the castle.
[173:51.11]Are you sure he has the ring with him?
[173:54.93]Good.
[173:56.91]Excellent.
[173:59.23]You will be rewarded.
[174:01.31]He'll soon find out what it costs to attack me.
[174:04.99]What greater pain could I possibly inflict on him than impede his quest when time is so precious?
[174:13.06]But the sun is rising, and now is not the time to play with my play.
[174:18.32]the fool he is walking to his death and he is not aware of it that is a screaming ride this is pretty cool looking actually
[174:50.06]Why does this look familiar somehow?
[175:13.08]Kind of looks like a Source Engine render.
[175:19.00]It's really cool looking.
[175:21.60]I love the crust.
[175:30.16]And I, you know what?
[175:32.90]Being able to build stuff like this, I feel like would be so much fun.
[175:45.04]I'm talking in a game engine, not in real life.
[176:08.93]What's stopping you?
[176:11.17]Talent, determination, and time capital willing to invest.
[176:37.84]creepy dungeon oil yep is somebody there answer me who's there
[177:02.39]Don't be frightened.
[177:04.19]It's been so long since anyone has talked to me that I thought I was still hearing voices.
[177:09.53]I'm so weary of hearing mine.
[177:11.75]I've been alone here for eons.
[177:16.56]Who are you?
[177:18.48]I am a woman who has been rejected, rejected and betrayed.
[177:23.70]A woman who has been unjustly punished.
[177:26.16]I am Dorko.
[177:28.80]What are you doing here?
[177:30.69]And you, what are you doing here?
[177:34.26]My name is Jonathan Harker.
[177:36.28]Count Dracula has kidnapped my wife and... Dracula, the traitor.
[177:42.34]He is the blackguard who sentenced me to live here like an outcast.
[177:46.54]He and my three blood sisters.
[177:49.50]They did this to me.
[177:50.94]You have opened my prison, but I am still not free.
[177:53.98]I can no longer get into the castle.
[177:56.91]Help me break the curse that binds me, and I will help you.
[178:00.05]I will help you to get your wife back.
[178:05.70]okay so what do we need to do my wife is locked up in the castle however I don't know where can you help me to find her your wife hmm those rings are crazy in a room in the darkest dungeons of the castle guarded by three demons who dwell in the crypt
[178:34.46]How can I overpower the demons and rescue Mina?
[178:37.62]It won't be easy.
[178:39.12]This world is very different from the one you live in.
[178:44.49]The castle has its own rules.
[178:47.03]Ignore them and you will surely die.
[178:50.45]Do you realize that?
[178:52.17]I'm not afraid.
[178:58.69]Believe me, fear has nothing to do with it.
[179:01.86]You don't have the slightest idea of what's waiting for you.
[179:06.12]Yes, I can help you, but only if you do everything I tell you and nothing else.
[179:13.57]Otherwise, you won't live long and your wife will be lost forever.
[179:19.13]Tell me right now.
[179:20.83]Listen carefully to me.
[179:23.57]If I am to help you find your wife, you need an object, a very important piece.
[179:29.81]It is an amulet kept in the crypt under the castle.
[179:33.79]Before you can unlock the invisible passage to the crypt, you must first find a key to the system, the Medal of the Dragon Brotherhood that once belonged to Dracula's father.
[179:46.35]An amulet?
[179:48.47]And a medal?
[179:49.88]What the fuck are they doing, man?
[179:50.86]This has been crazy.
[179:51.94]These camera angles have been outrageous.
[180:16.98]Somebody said, do you still stand by the whole wish video games all look like this nowadays?
[180:22.93]Yes.
[180:25.97]I do.
[180:34.04]Well, maybe not all of them, but a decent, a decent portion of them, you know?
[180:42.37]Okay, so we gotta find the amulet.
[180:44.65]There's a magical amulet, and I think that's probably... I think the castle is the next place we'll pick it up.
[181:00.34]Yeah, it's about 1130.
[181:07.74]It's getting kind of late.
[181:10.99]2.30 AM Eastern time so.
[181:17.15]Whoops.
[181:18.41]But well, I will finish this tomorrow.
[181:20.99]Will do it tomorrow night.
[181:33.28]Oh, I mean, we're not going to do it tomorrow exactly.
[181:41.90]Maybe we'll do a little bit of World of Warcraft before.
[181:45.42]Yeah, we'll do some WoW before and then from there we'll move into this.
[181:58.13]Maybe a little bit later in the afternoon.
[182:12.20]What if I'm back in two hours again?
[182:14.36]Now that would be crazy.
[182:21.70]Save, that's a good thought.
[182:32.18]For a second, I thought that's how long I've been playing for, and I said, like, there's no way.
[182:42.16]My brain just had to turn off for a second.
[182:46.93]Alright guys, I'll see you later.
[182:49.55]We'll pick it up tomorrow.
[182:54.27]Actually, the game's going to have to crash anyway, so I'll just do it myself like this.
[183:11.85]Hopefully it keeps the save, which it will.
[183:20.47]Okay, there we go.
[183:25.20]Yeah, I was not planning on doing two streams in the same day, but here we are, right?
[183:52.88]Is this a triumphant return to streaming?
[183:58.32]No, you know what?
[184:01.28]I don't think I need to say yes or no to that, right?
[184:07.91]I'm just doing it.
[184:09.77]I'm just doing it because I want to.
[184:14.27]Yeah, it is what it is.
[184:15.89]It just is what it is.
[184:20.39]There will be times that I'm not going to feel like it.
[184:22.23]I'm not going to really want to.
[184:23.11]And I just won't.
[184:39.02]I think what I did, I just ripped off all the... Obviously, two years ago when I said I was slowing down and stopping and a lot of that really had to do with
[184:51.08]I was starting to get a little older.
[184:54.30]Off-brand stuff for the off-brand company.
[185:02.35]I started playing a lot less games too.
[185:05.71]Focusing on other factors of my life.
[185:11.19]But now that I'm kind of just here.
[185:12.49]I'm really glad I did it.
[185:21.05]I'm glad I kind of took the time away, honestly.
[185:22.81]Because now it's just, you know, whatever.
[185:39.86]And I definitely put expectations on myself.
[185:43.87]And across this whole channel for at least a few years.
[186:01.65]Yeah, you burn out a little bit.
[186:03.75]That's what I'm saying.
[186:04.93]Sometimes you need to burn out.
[186:05.93]The phoenix has to rise from the ashes, right?
[186:10.80]And I mean, we're talking about a live stream.
[186:13.54]The phoenix rises from the ashes, bros!
[186:16.52]Let's reel it in a little.
[186:31.71]But no, I've been enjoying it a lot.
[186:33.41]I've been having a lot of fun.
[186:37.49]And I'm just going to keep trading it the exact same way.
[186:51.81]I've been following you for over 15 years.
[186:54.29]That's so wild.
[186:56.99]That's so long.
[186:58.39]That's such a long time.
[187:10.41]12 years.
[187:14.23]12 years.
[187:14.57]I can't even remember what happened five years ago, let alone 15.
[187:20.08]Yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[187:34.53]We'll keep it rolling.
[187:57.67]Main character aura?
[187:58.85]Is it a bad thing?
[188:01.75]Or is it a good thing?
[188:12.00]Is it usually a bad thing?
[188:13.71]I think that's not a good thing.
[188:28.34]I don't want to be the main- I don't want to be main character.
[188:30.29]Main char- that sucks.
[188:34.55]You gotta- you gotta run around, you gotta rescue people from dungeons, you've gotta... carry gear.
[188:41.92]I want to be one of the merchants that... you come across like once a year.
[188:47.42]I want to sell like the rings.
[189:07.52]Just bring some Gatorade.
