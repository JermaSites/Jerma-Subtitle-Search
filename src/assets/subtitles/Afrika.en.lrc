[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.04]Yes.
[00:02.84]Yes, really.
[00:04.55]Yeah, I know I told you that it probably wasn't going to happen today, but... I'm full of surprises, aren't I?
[00:12.96]Hi, guys.
[00:13.26]Uh, yeah, we're going to try.
[00:16.74]There's been some strange happenings.
[00:21.54]Over the last few days.
[00:23.68]And I'm not gonna stream just yet.
[00:26.83]I'm gonna make sure this is gonna work.
[00:29.01]So we're gonna hang out here for like five to ten minutes and see what happens.
[00:33.17]If we're still green, like solid green, uh, heck yeah.
[00:38.80]Sounds like a plan.
[00:42.10]Telephone hangout stream.
[00:43.38]No, I do, I actually have something that I've been really looking forward to playing.
[00:48.96]But we're not going to show that yet.
[00:51.38]It's the title.
[00:52.22]It's in the stream title.
[00:54.18]Why do I think there's some type of curtain I can drop here?
[00:56.22]Well, I'm not going to tell you what the game is.
[00:58.58]I'm going to make it be a surprise.
[00:59.76]It's the title of the stream, and it's the game category.
[01:06.22]But... Hold on.
[01:08.32]Let me just make sure we're good.
[01:09.33]Yeah, we're good.
[01:13.35]Is it Resident Evil?
[01:14.13]No, it is... Oh, maybe some of you guys haven't refreshed.
[01:18.03]Oh, would you look at that?
[01:20.76]Looks like some of you guys might not have refreshed.
[01:28.75]Is it Bookworm Adventures?
[01:29.99]No.
[01:31.65]It is... Africa.
[01:36.52]The game Africa.
[01:38.16]This is a rare PlayStation 3 game.
[01:41.98]Let's hope it's worth the $50 I spent on it.
[01:45.46]Because it's rare.
[01:47.58]That doesn't mean good, but okay.
[01:54.94]We're gonna be playing a rare one tonight.
[01:56.46]Yeah, I'll give you a quick little sneak peek.
[01:58.80]How does that sound?
[02:00.20]Ding dong, look at that.
[02:02.63]Okay, back to the intro.
[02:04.58]Oops.
[02:05.42]Well now it's... Now it's just playing, isn't it?
[02:10.52]I probably should turn that off.
[02:14.23]Uh, this is a game where you take photos.
[02:16.35]That's the whole game.
[02:17.07]It's Pokémon Snap, but real life.
[02:21.05]It's a real life Pokémon Snap.
[02:25.14]You gotta get perfect angles.
[02:31.13]And this is the game we're going to play today.
[02:33.77]Because I don't want to start the vibe.
[02:37.53]And I know what some of you were thinking.
[02:39.81]That I'm Pikachu Soxing everybody here.
[02:42.92]And that I'm a liar.
[02:43.88]And I don't... Let me just go... Let me make sure... We're going to see lots of PogChamps in the chat.
[02:48.18]Because this is like a year in the making.
[02:51.86]I finally own this.
[02:55.41]Just so people understand that this is not a Pikachu sock scenario.
[02:59.88]There it is.
[03:01.08]There's the vibe.
[03:01.84]It's real.
[03:02.42]I didn't make this out of, like, plastic and cardboard and shit.
[03:04.58]I mean, I could have.
[03:06.88]It's real.
[03:07.82]It's here.
[03:08.83]It's set up, and that's what I thought I was gonna be doing over the next three or four days.
[03:13.61]Unfortunately, that didn't happen.
[03:19.32]Internet was all fucked up.
[03:20.80]We had a lot of issues.
[03:21.78]Uh, and I'm gonna give Cox the benefit of the doubt on this one.
[03:26.31]I know I hate to say that.
[03:28.80]But the weather here has been fucking crazy.
[03:31.47]We've been getting like 60 plus mile per hour winds.
[03:36.45]Like enough to take trees down and stuff.
[03:39.21]And it's been record rainfall.
[03:41.32]We had a shitload of rain.
[03:43.32]So I... Maybe the anger was misdirected.
[03:50.21]Potentially.
[03:51.51]I don't know.
[03:52.41]We have not dropped a single frame yet today.
[03:55.60]There was a weird bandwidth problem me and Etalyx were having, so me and Etalyx are trying to work through these weird issues that we keep having with this company.
[04:03.80]But I don't see any dropped frames at all in about five minutes, so I think I can stop stalling.
[04:10.77]I don't know.
[04:11.39]Should I?
[04:12.01]Should I make a tweet and say that the stream is on?
[04:18.81]I think... I don't want to jinx it.
[04:23.15]Because the last stream from this place was actually Etalyx.
[04:28.51]And that was like, what, two days ago?
[04:31.25]And he dropped like 30,000-40,000 frames.
[04:33.31]So, I don't want to jinx it.
[04:38.34]But, you know, let's go.
[04:40.98]I've been wanting to stream for like three days.
[04:44.74]I've got so much shit you guys have no idea.
[04:46.52]We've got Africa.
[04:48.02]The whole continent is here.
[04:50.48]In my house.
[04:52.85]We got all the Vive shit.
[04:55.31]This room is Vive-ified.
[04:56.83]I Vive-ed it two days ago.
[05:00.51]We get Space Channel 5 Part 1.
[05:03.83]I bought a shitload more PlayStation 2 games.
[05:05.97]I'm ready to go.
[05:08.44]And I gotta get out of here.
[05:09.84]So I'll see you tomorrow.
[05:10.96]No, alright.
[05:11.62]Let me just make a tweet.
[05:12.52]Then we can play Africa.
[05:16.14]Metro Exodus just released.
[05:17.82]But I didn't play Last Light.
[05:19.02]I can't just play Exodus.
[05:21.18]You can't watch Star Wars Episode 4 and then skip to Episode 6 if you've never seen them before.
[05:27.24]It would be like, why would you do that?
[05:29.56]You'd have so many questions.
[05:34.40]Alright, I think we're good to go.
[05:36.72]Oh boy, the whip disc.
[05:38.80]I got some good news for the house here today.
[05:41.86]No drop frames in five minutes?
[05:43.40]That is beyond recognizable to us recently.
[05:48.26]Let me see here.
[05:50.64]Because it was fucking bright red like an hour ago.
[05:53.02]This is weird.
[05:53.96]What a fucking weird technology.
[05:58.15]Alright.
[05:58.91]But I was told it was going to get fixed today.
[06:00.79]That's what I was told.
[06:03.87]Anyway, let's go ahead and tweet that.
[06:06.99]I'll go ahead and get this off so you can take a look at this fun intro with like the lizard.
[06:11.34]I think the stalling can end.
[06:20.16]Oh, you need audio too, don't you?
[06:22.28]You'll get it in a second.
[06:27.68]So if you end up hearing, which you probably will, there's probably going to be a scenario where it sounds like my house is going to fall over because of the wind.
[06:35.73]It's supposed to keep going over into midnight tonight.
[06:38.15]So you will hear like my room is being microwaved.
[06:42.32]That's the sound it makes.
[06:43.52]That's the only way it can compare it to.
[06:44.78]Okay, there it is.
[06:50.26]Alright, I just tweeted it.
[06:51.42]That means it's real.
[06:52.84]Let's go.
[06:58.72]Get that audio on.
[07:04.57]I turned it on right when it stopped.
[07:05.99]Alright, we need to test something here.
[07:11.33]How are there already seven clips of this spring?
[07:14.80]Did somebody, did you accidentally press the clip it button?
[07:18.30]And you're like, oh shit, hopefully nobody saw that.
[07:21.64]Alright, let's make sure that it's synced up.
[07:24.00]All we can do is New Game, so... New Game.
[07:27.98]And there's the MGM Lion.
[07:34.65]We are currently autosaving.
[07:37.01]Again, if you're just joining us, this is the rarest PlayStation 3 game that exists in North America.
[07:42.66]It was $500.
[07:42.98]So... I mean...
[07:50.71]Hopefully we get to play it Is that the real with what's going on here
[08:16.82]Do I have to, like, reset this game?
[08:19.14]I thought you're never supposed to do this.
[08:20.36]Aren't you not supposed to ever do this with any console, ever?
[08:27.59]I can't turn the console off.
[08:31.71]That's the number one cardinal sin.
[08:34.79]Is turning off your console during a save.
[08:38.26]And this is like, Etalyx let me borrow this.
[08:39.96]I'm gonna break his PlayStation 3.
[08:41.92]What am I gonna do about this?
[08:46.68]What if I, like, wipe- What if he's got some, like, saves on here that are really important?
[08:53.91]I just looked it up.
[08:54.75]It's $50 for a used copy.
[08:56.03]Yes, it is.
[08:56.77]Alright, um... I don't... Motherfuck.
[09:08.00]What's wrong with this?
[09:08.78]The disc is perfect.
[09:12.53]The disc is perfect.
[09:16.05]This is not even, this is almost like factory new.
[09:22.98]Now something just fucked up there, we just had like a glitch.
[09:27.98]Nah, we're good.
[09:28.54]We're good, just everybody calm down.
[09:36.20]Let's try that again.
[09:42.35]It's broken and not used?
[09:45.89]He's actually microwaving his room.
[09:47.95]Somebody microwaved the room.
[09:49.07]I don't know.
[09:50.63]Somebody went on to the... You know, every room has a fucking panel.
[09:54.79]Every micro... I don't know what I meant to say.
[09:56.17]Every microwave has the panel.
[09:58.89]Somebody put on like five seconds and pressed it.
[10:03.89]Let's try again.
[10:12.63]Well, the internet works.
[10:13.91]Isn't that spectacular?
[10:35.46]I told you I wasn't supposed to do that.
[10:43.63]Don't tell him.
[10:44.29]Don't tell him.
[10:45.47]Let me be the one that tells him.
[10:47.27]Let me be the one that tells him.
[10:59.06]Let me be the one that tells him.
[11:00.08]I can't fucking believe it.
[11:01.04]I just wanted to play Africa and take photos.
[11:04.56]What did I do?
[11:05.54]What happened?
[11:11.04]How do I even do that?
[11:18.14]How do I delete that?
[11:20.32]How do you delete save data?
[11:27.30]He's watching.
[11:28.51]I don't understand what happened.
[11:39.33]Um.
[11:45.82]I'm going to delete the save data for, okay, that's good.
[11:54.34]Let's, let's hold on.
[12:01.44]I'm going to do it again and see what happens.
[12:06.41]I'm so like sad right now.
[12:14.42]I didn't even do anything.
[12:15.84]I just put a game disc in the PlayStation.
[12:24.19]That didn't... I don't think that... No, don't worry.
[12:25.93]It didn't delete everything.
[12:29.99]It didn't delete everything.
[12:31.47]It only deleted Africa.
[12:36.76]I hope.
[12:40.03]Do not see?
[12:40.91]That's what I'm telling you guys.
[12:42.39]Everyone was telling me that I should have done that.
[12:44.15]Fucking autosave.
[12:46.62]When's someone going to come up with an autosave that doesn't fucking brick your entire... Do it.
[12:51.78]Do it.
[12:52.12]Let's go.
[12:52.84]Autosave.
[12:53.30]Hurry the fuck up.
[12:56.48]What is happening right now?
[13:05.09]I'm going to leave it for a second.
[13:09.23]I'm impatient?
[13:10.55]It shouldn't take this long!
[13:15.64]Just wait, just wait, okay.
[13:24.63]See, I'm an impatient boomer.
[13:26.97]I don't know man, after two to three straight minutes.
[13:38.71]Might have to delete all the local content.
[13:40.93]No!
[13:41.55]I can't do that!
[13:50.18]Okay.
[13:53.84]It takes a long time to load a whole continent.
[13:57.24]I'm gonna give this another two minutes.
[13:58.30]I just gotta wipe his hard drive.
[14:09.60]Try unplugging it now.
[14:17.34]If I have to factory reset his PlayStation.
[14:20.15]What do you mean Google it?
[14:25.43]It takes that long.
[14:28.43]What?
[14:33.39]Oh my god, so I bricked his PS3 for no reason.
[14:40.50]It has a 387 megabyte save file.
[14:46.02]Why does it have a 400 meg save file?
[14:54.61]Okay, well, sorry.
[14:55.95]Etalyx.
[14:56.39]I may have bricked your saves.
[14:58.37]It's alright.
[14:59.05]You can make a new Demon's Souls character.
[15:01.11]It's alright.
[15:01.55]Don't worry.
[15:01.97]I'm sorry.
[15:05.76]Music volume in midnight mode.
[15:08.82]I don't have that.
[15:10.97]Alright, can we get the Jurassic Park music down a little bit?
[15:13.93]No, keep it up.
[15:15.57]No, that's too much.
[15:17.41]Two ticks down.
[15:25.33]It is the lo- Look, how many times- Okay, thank god.
[15:27.95]If it was gonna be like five minutes every time.
[15:31.26]This is an incredibly poorly optimized- Uh, learn all about Africa and its animals.
[15:36.58]Alright.
[15:37.70]Read about any animals you've discovered in Safari mode.
[15:42.39]We're going to get default unlockables, which is bugs, shrimp, and tigers.
[15:49.42]At least we'll have the defaults.
[16:01.45]Ah, so it's zebra.
[16:02.31]I told you we were going to get those.
[16:03.59]Let's learn about the zebra.
[16:06.28]I love this.
[16:07.32]This is the rarest PlayStation 3 game in North America.
[16:10.58]This was $500.
[16:11.98]You understand?
[16:15.61]Let's go.
[16:15.93]Uh, 3D view profile... There's a... Look at this, there's even video, there's even... Never mind.
[16:28.63]There's 3D view... Okay, that's what an adult looks like, what about a baby?
[16:40.18]I don't, I have not found the baby yet.
[16:41.44]We gotta take a picture of everything.
[16:43.50]Plains or birch hills zebras are Africa's most common zebra species.
[16:46.57]They can be distinguished from other species by their unique pattern of stripes, which are wide and widely spaced.
[16:51.45]As in all zebra species, the stripes are thought to help visually distract potential predators.
[16:58.09]So that's, uh, top right, that's what the zebra, that's the male and female?
[17:05.17]I guess the, maybe the female stands up on two legs?
[17:08.52]Interesting.
[17:10.06]Wears shoes, too.
[17:15.95]New record.
[17:19.29]Four to four and a half feet at the shoulder.
[17:21.87]And they weigh 485 to 775.
[17:25.65]Music's too loud.
[17:26.35]And we got 50 fucking subs just came in.
[17:29.26]50 of them.
[17:30.29]That's right.
[17:30.67]500 community subs.
[17:33.27]What is going on?
[17:34.05]No.
[17:34.51]Oh my god.
[17:35.53]50 and then 10.
[17:36.21]Great Canadian Fuck Club gave $6,000 worth of subs right there.
[17:39.49]Whatever it was.
[17:40.41]Thank you so much, dude.
[17:41.21]That's a shitload.
[17:42.68]Whiff Whiff Psy gave 10.
[17:46.80]Oh, Great Canadian's back.
[17:50.34]Alright, that's cool.
[17:54.96]I mean, no, that is cool.
[17:55.84]I'm talking about the game.
[17:56.68]That's cool.
[17:57.82]This is cool.
[18:00.24]That's a lot of fucking money.
[18:06.50]50 gifted subs is two, three, that's 250 bucks?
[18:11.97]My god.
[18:14.25]Thanks for the $300, it's cool, I guess.
[18:20.05]And yes, I understand, I'm going real slow.
[18:22.03]It's been 20 minutes.
[18:24.19]But I have to make sure that this internet is going to work.
[18:26.57]Otherwise, this is the rarest fucking PlayStation 3 game.
[18:31.04]I ain't going to turn this on and get turned off in five seconds.
[18:34.86]Ten community subs from Multitrip.
[18:37.58]Thank you, Multitrip.

[23:44.52]It's just Francine.
[23:49.49]That's fine.
[23:50.47]Francine Focus.
[23:51.51]Look at how beautiful this game is.
[23:58.97]And you didn't want me to play it.
[24:00.54]You.
[24:04.86]A245 Fortnite.
[24:06.82]That guy didn't want me to fucking play.
[24:10.12]Get him out of here.
[24:22.67]What?
[24:23.54]Oh.
[24:24.34]I thought that was me.
[24:24.92]We finally arrived at the Manyanga Conservation Area.
[24:29.76]Okay.
[24:30.74]Base camp is all set up, so let's start exploring right away.
[24:33.64]The game gets it.
[24:34.32]No, who wants to do a tutorial?
[24:35.90]Who wants to learn everything?
[24:36.78]Just get us out there, into the wild, and get the camera in my hands.
[24:41.06]Looking forward to working with you, Francine.
[24:42.54]You too, Eric.
[24:44.00]Uh, the Jambo Navi interface is all set up on the laptop.
[24:48.95]There may be messages from the head office, so you should check your email now.
[24:52.79]Just select a laptop PC to use it.
[24:59.09]Uh, check email, transfer photos from your camera, purchase equipment, and more?
[25:04.00]Okay.
[25:07.47]Got email, photo, gallery, shopping, save.
[25:11.96]Let's go ahead and get that out of the way so we don't corrupt it.
[25:20.38]387 megabytes.
[25:22.88]Is this going to take that long to save it every time?
[25:31.37]Yeah, it's going to take like two minutes to save every time.
[25:44.08]That's insane.
[25:46.44]Did they just copy and paste the whole game in a save state?
[25:50.15]That might be what this is.
[25:52.93]Is this game more than 400 meg?
[25:54.49]This is 10 years ago.
[26:04.86]That's not counting photos.
[26:06.12]So once I start... Once I have like 50 to 100 photos in my library, this is gonna be like 5 gig.
[26:11.68]Saving is gonna take like an hour.
[26:21.14]This is probably why nobody owns it.
[26:24.67]Maybe.
[26:25.67]Alright, let's check the email.
[26:30.97]When your in-game email, pretend email, is faster than your save, there's something wrong.
[26:36.97]You could have made that a little longer.
[26:38.14]Important wildlife research request.
[26:41.62]Welcome to the Manyanga Conservation Area.
[26:43.56]If you are the first to research Manyanga,
[26:46.89]So we need you to start by documenting the animals that live here.
[26:49.71]Anytime you see a new animal, take a picture of it and send it by replying to this email.
[26:55.13]Then we can send you new photo assignments for that animal.
[27:00.78]Okay.
[27:05.38]Bits?
[27:05.66]We got big bits?
[27:08.50]Holy shit, we did have big bits.
[27:14.08]A hundred dollars.
[27:19.08]Uh, thank you for the hundred bucks, G-Y-H-D-H-F-E.
[27:22.72]Uh, based on your responses to my questions, I've determined that you'd be, uh, impotent, asexual, or answers of a beta male.
[27:31.86]Also, your responses on my fetish question, I've determined you'd be a person with really fucked up fetishes, because if a person doesn't express his fetishes online, he's really fucked up, and he can't reveal his way out of all this.
[27:41.97]However, you have to answer this question or else it's a bad place to have you tried.
[27:44.93]I'm not gonna read that out loud.
[27:49.18]Okay.
[27:50.46]I got two things to ask you there.
[27:52.92]Two questions.
[27:54.28]I got a question for you.
[27:56.11]Let's get this out of the way.
[27:58.73]Question number one for you.
[28:02.21]Why do you care so much about my sexuality, huh?
[28:04.85]Isn't that my business?
[28:05.59]You know what I mean?
[28:07.75]Ain't that like my business?
[28:09.33]You know what I'm saying?
[28:12.19]Question number two for you.
[28:14.61]Equally as important.
[28:20.93]No, it is ours.
[28:21.91]What?
[28:22.11]Alright, I'm in a very happy relationship with someone named Kim.
[28:36.41]She's my girlfriend.
[28:37.56]We've got a healthy relationship.
[28:40.42]That's all you need to know.
[28:48.19]I'm not gonna answer the question at the end of that, because that's not appropriate for me to say on a livestream of me taking pictures of animals in Africa.
[28:58.91]Okay?
[29:00.81]If this was like a podcast, like, let's talk about appropriate shit here.
[29:04.70]If I was doing a podcast about, like, about sexual shit, alright, yeah, but I'm like about to take a picture of a zebra.
[29:17.26]Where's the context of this conversation?
[29:24.87]We can't even get to the animals at this rate.
[29:31.37]Anyways, no.
[29:35.87]You can't just like, alright, let me, let me, I'm gonna make one more point here.
[29:39.65]You can't, okay, okay, if somebody was coming out of a coffee shop, right, let's say, let's say Brad Pitt was coming out of a coffee shop, right?
[29:46.96]Like, yeah, it's Brad Pitt, you know, you like know him, you've seen his movies.
[29:51.40]And you run up to Brad Pitt.
[29:53.24]There's, like, a bunch of people, like, taking pictures of him.
[29:55.77]And he's like, oh, no, no, no photos today, please.
[29:57.81]I've got pictures of zebras to take.
[30:00.19]I've got to take pictures of zebras.
[30:02.29]And they're like, okay, yeah.
[30:03.67]You run fucking through the crowd.
[30:05.67]And you, like, run in there and you're like, hey, have you ever tried to blank your own blank?
[30:13.11]He's going to be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[30:22.51]He's gonna be like, he's gonna walk away.
[30:29.03]Comparing yourself to Brad Pitt.
[30:32.53]I mean, this is 3,300 people here.
[30:37.18]How many people have seen Brad Pitt's movies?
[30:39.60]Maybe like 5,000 to 10,000?
[30:41.60]He gets like 5,000 to 10,000 concurrent viewers on his movies.
[30:44.66]I think I'm in like a similar category, I think.
[30:53.95]Thank you for the hundred bucks, though.
[30:57.76]Alright, and we had another- we had fifty fucking dollars.
[31:01.72]From Chunky Bologna.
[31:08.01]Chunky Bologna, thanks for fifty dollars and two cents.
[31:09.97]Here's a nice cheer to get the taste of the last one out of your mouth.
[31:12.83]Now, happy Friday.

[31:53.94]I already have that.
[31:57.78]Alright, I... I... I... I'm... Let's go.
[32:00.14]Take a picture of it and set... Every time I see a new animal, take a picture of it and send it to my email.
[32:06.93]You got it.
[32:08.65]So, difficulty, uh, is level one.
[32:11.57]Just get new... Let's go.
[32:12.57]Let's go take some photos.
[32:13.49]Let's go.
[32:16.24]A job request already came in, did it?
[32:18.22]Just start by taking a picture of each type of animal that you see.
[32:21.69]Francine, this is for you.
[32:23.99]A Tissetzi type F. It's my first camera.
[32:30.79]And binoculars.
[32:32.65]And a GPS map.
[32:35.07]The camera case is over there.
[32:38.61]F for Francine.
[32:41.81]I put the tools and the cases next to the bookshelf.
[32:45.49]I'd like to go too, but I need to sort out our equipment.
[32:48.39]Can you go with the guide, James?
[32:52.19]It should be waiting just outside.
[32:53.45]Oh, the guide's name is James.
[32:54.59]I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[32:56.07]I have a safe trip.
[32:56.83]Okay.
[32:58.85]So let's go into the camera case.
[33:01.36]Make sure that's equipped.
[33:03.80]View cameras and lenses.
[33:05.12]We've got the type F. Body is type F. That's all I got.
[33:10.04]There's multiple bodies, multiple lenses.
[33:13.90]I don't think I can do anything else.
[33:18.38]View tools, they're already equipped.
[33:19.76]Yep, binoculars, GPS map.
[33:22.50]Use with the R1 button.
[33:25.03]Use with select.
[33:25.95]Good thing I looked at that, otherwise I would have been like, dude, don't even explain how to play!
[33:33.75]Exit base camp.
[33:44.64]Tetsy.
[33:45.68]Tetsy.
[33:46.64]It's your birthday today.
[33:50.20]You know what's on the way.
[33:59.66]We should be way more excited about something else.
[34:02.52]Zero drop frames.
[34:05.21]Maybe they fixed it.
[34:05.83]I don't know.
[34:07.81]I'm not going to be... I can't say that's going to happen.
[34:10.71]We're at Duma Step.
[34:11.61]Okay.
[34:16.05]Okay.
[34:18.11]Uh, Jambo Francine.
[34:19.89]Welcome to the Manyanga Conservation Area.
[34:22.89]I'll drive the car, Francine.
[34:24.27]Go ahead and take- make yourself comfortable in the backseat.
[34:30.00]Though I have to take pictures of animals, right?
[34:32.84]Oh, we get like a Monster Hunter map.
[34:37.00]Where's the, uh... What's it- what's it- ah, the- the- the cool- the Tuzuyaku?
[34:43.28]The Cooluyaku?
[34:44.42]What's the bird's name?
[34:45.26]The bird with the egg?
[34:47.59]Hippo pool.
[34:53.16]This is the hippo pool.
[34:56.22]Yeah, well, I would have driven another, like, five feet up there.
[35:01.24]Nobody is home right now, but hippos often bathe here.
[35:03.60]Yeah, I know that.
[35:04.24]I've played the game before.
[35:05.10]Drive.
[35:06.67]Wrong way.
[35:07.13]Wrong way, idiot.
[35:08.33]Like, fucking idiot.
[35:09.27]Doesn't even know where he's going.
[35:14.87]You know, I've done this before.
[35:15.93]You know that?
[35:18.75]Hello?
[35:19.51]You know, I've done this.
[35:20.39]I drip over here.
[35:21.23]You're going the wrong way.
[35:22.07]Just turn around.
[35:27.83]Wow, you like went into the ditch for a second.
[35:30.40]What a fucking idiot.
[35:32.80]God, how does this person have 3,000 viewers?
[35:34.24]I don't understand.
[35:38.10]Am I supposed to be taking pictures?
[35:40.44]How do I take pictures?
[35:45.99]How do I take a photo?
[35:46.83]Is this just like teaching you that the air... Okay, here we go.
[35:49.51]Not many animals here.
[35:50.43]There are a shitload of animals here.
[35:51.53]There's a... That bird's coming down and swooping down and gonna get us.
[35:56.40]Let's try a wily oasis.
[35:58.38]Where there's water, there's life, right?
[36:03.30]Blind.
[36:04.36]There are no animals.
[36:05.08]Wow, this is a blind streamer.
[36:07.39]Can't even see the fucking animal in front of him.
[36:09.35]Is he... He's pretending.
[36:10.27]He has to be.
[36:13.99]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[36:14.81]Like, seriously?
[36:15.39]Like, how do you not see that?
[36:17.03]There were clearly three or four deer in front of him, and he just doesn't see them?
[36:22.16]I just don't get it.
[36:22.76]He needs to start paying the fuck attention to stuff.
[36:24.52]It's pissing me off lately.
[36:33.45]That's the Oasis, yeah.
[36:39.77]Just like I said, plenty of animals here.
[36:41.51]Oh, let's get a giraffe.
[36:46.38]Too far to see?
[36:47.06]Try the binoculars.
[36:48.40]Press R1 button to use the binoculars.
[36:53.70]Let's get... Oh, whoops.
[36:55.16]It could get a bit bumpy, so hang on.
[36:56.88]Oh, I can't wait to see how badly he drives.
[36:58.98]Come on, streamer.
[37:02.62]He actually did just smash into that.
[37:03.99]Alright, we can find the perfect one.
[37:09.13]Look at that.
[37:09.65]Plains zebras.
[37:13.55]I would laugh my ass off if he fucking runs into him.
[37:15.81]Look, they're... What?
[37:23.74]What about the giraffe?
[37:25.78]Look at that.
[37:26.72]Maasai giraffes.
[37:30.84]Yeah, wait, it was also... What's this one?
[37:34.29]The little, um... The little ones.
[37:39.43]Hawali Oasis.
[37:44.10]By the way, Francine, do you know how to use the camera?
[37:47.78]I have no idea.
[37:49.90]Press the square button to point the camera and press the circle button or R1 to shoot.
[37:54.69]This one right to the right is looking like prime picture material.
[37:58.89]They're right in front of the bush.
[38:01.83]Why don't you try it out now?
[38:02.71]Point the camera and then snap a picture.
[38:08.78]How do I zoom in?
[38:13.94]No, that's not good enough.
[38:25.79]Where's the truck?
[38:29.55]Where's the truck?
[38:30.17]Okay, I don't know where the truck went.
[38:36.18]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[38:42.28]Check your photos in the field menu.
[38:45.56]Press the triangle button to open the field menu.
[38:49.48]Photos.
[38:53.61]Look at how beautiful that is.
[38:54.77]A little blurry, but it's alright.
[38:58.33]That's a pretty good calendar photo, I would say.
[39:03.11]Tools, missions, okay, good.
[39:04.63]Try taking some pictures up close.
[39:05.93]Press X button to exit the car.
[39:08.07]But please don't stray too far from the car.
[39:12.24]Good luck!
[39:12.68]Snapshots of plenty of animals.
[39:16.02]You're not going to leave me, are you?
[39:17.20]I can actually walk around?
[39:18.36]How did that one come up?
[39:57.48]Oh, come on!
[39:59.60]I pressed the wrong button.
[40:02.21]Come on, do something, do it again.
[40:12.44]No, I gotta take pictures of, like, animals.
[40:16.98]No, you scare them.
[40:17.88]Okay, I got zebras.
[40:19.56]I need giraffe.
[40:22.53]Is it, like, a sneak button?
[40:23.69]What's, like, the stealth kill button?
[40:25.61]And I don't mean, like, the stealth kill button.
[40:27.19]I mean, like, the stealth button that makes you creep down and do the... Like, I... Hold on.
[40:31.07]Just quiet.
[40:32.03]There's one right here.
[40:35.70]No, I gotta get closer than that.
[40:41.94]God damn it.
[40:49.53]What are those little guys called?
[40:51.13]Francine, don't wander too far, it's dangerous.
[40:54.21]Can I get like fucking eaten by a lion?
[40:57.91]Come on, come on!
[41:02.15]That was the wrong button.
[41:03.93]It's circle.
[41:14.25]I keep thinking it's X. Okay, there's the giraffe.
[41:26.24]Get one close.
[41:27.24]I mean, I can't get that close to a giraffe, guys.
[41:37.82]Not bad.
[41:40.38]I gotta get the little ones.
[41:43.44]There they are.
[41:43.86]Okay, let's get up there.
[41:45.44]Right next to this tree.
[41:46.50]Can I get it?
[41:46.98]Come on.
[41:48.84]I gotta get away.
[41:49.84]Don't run away!
[41:50.54]Stop!
[41:51.18]Ugh!
[41:51.33]Here we go.
[41:57.95]Just gotta be patient.
[42:00.05]He's gonna pop up from behind the bush.
[42:03.83]Beautiful.
[42:05.09]Oh!
[42:05.67]Excellent job.
[42:06.39]That's it.
[42:07.51]Tutorial mission passed.
[42:14.35]You have to crouch to enter sneak mode.
[42:15.91]Oh, I don't know how to crouch.
[42:23.23]No.
[42:24.11]Wasted film.
[42:30.57]Baby giraffes look like adult giraffes.
[42:32.19]They're just... Get the rhino!
[42:37.89]Where's the rhino?
[42:41.97]I gotta get back in the car to get the rhino.
[42:49.12]What about that?
[42:49.86]Is that a zebra?
[42:50.62]Yeah.
[43:03.83]It's great that they actually pose, though.
[43:09.14]Let's go back to base camp.
[43:10.08]Let's review the photos and do the tutorial.
[43:11.68]We might get a couple of action shots here.
[43:16.92]This might be good.
[43:17.48]There's the rhino.
[43:23.12]Looking for a Rhino.
[43:23.78]Come on, something crazy is going to happen.
[43:37.07]He doesn't know where the Rhino is.
[43:38.65]I'll get the Rhino eventually.
[43:43.45]I'm not operating the car.
[43:44.47]Maybe I get to drive the car eventually.
[43:45.73]I would assume you probably can, right?
[43:47.57]What are those?
[43:51.03]Lightning shot up.
[43:56.43]Are those just regular horses?
[44:02.39]What are those?
[44:04.83]Got ya.
[44:11.03]Gazelles.
[44:17.63]Horses.
[44:18.07]I don't know, from far away you couldn't even tell.
[44:26.72]This is an on-rail shooter.
[44:29.26]Well, only for this portion.
[44:30.98]You actually get to get out.
[44:31.86]Let's review those photos.
[44:42.82]Send them pictures of the gas tanks.
[44:44.56]Hey, how was the safari today?
[44:50.66]Many types of animals live in the area.
[44:51.93]Good luck tomorrow, too.
[44:54.36]There are like 500 animals to take pictures of in this game.
[45:01.38]How is it on the field?
[45:02.12]Find lots of animals?
[45:02.98]Transfer your photos to Jambo Navi.
[45:05.30]Also, send the head office a photo of each animal that you took by replying to their email.
[45:09.37]Okay.
[45:13.49]Uh, transfer photos.
[45:14.71]What do you mean transfer?
[45:18.09]I didn't... What?
[45:25.42]Oh, okay, I have to check the ones that I want to send.
[45:31.20]So yeah, let's take it with view.
[45:34.28]That one's not bad.
[45:34.86]I like that one.
[45:37.56]No, that one's way better.
[45:39.08]This one's... I mean, that's just a... I mean, that's just a handsome fella, you know what I mean?
[45:45.40]Uh, this one... No.
[45:52.44]Where was it?
[45:55.03]This is so bad.
[45:56.47]This is like grandma with an iPhone at the Disney one.
[46:03.15]I like that one.
[46:06.13]Oh, good picture, grandma.
[46:07.46]This is like in your group chat.
[46:10.48]Everybody has one with their family.
[46:14.14]And even when you say hide notifications, it doesn't matter.
[46:17.00]It still pops up in the top of your phone.
[46:23.80]And you have to kind of, like, chime in, like, you know, your grandma's in there, so you're going to be like, oh, that's a really cool picture you got there of, like, the turkey.
[46:31.88]Yeah, I was at the safari at Disney World, and let me show you this photo.
[46:37.11]And then everyone's like, oh, wow, Grandma, you could be on, like, National Geographic with those photos.
[46:40.87]And she's like, yeah, that's a funny laughing emoji face.
[46:44.45]That's how it goes every time.
[46:54.84]But I'm gonna take this one.
[46:58.19]Here's the one I wanted to use.
[46:59.05]That one, that's a cool zebra.
[47:01.69]Is the... Okay.
[47:02.87]Let's transfer those.
[47:07.24]Did I just delete everything?
[47:09.42]Did I just delete everything?
[47:12.68]No.
[47:13.01]What?
[47:24.25]So this, wait, this is spaced for photos.
[47:28.91]So this is what, I can save them?
[47:30.27]Let me just go to the email.
[47:36.35]Alright, let's see here.
[47:37.13]We got reply.
[47:40.01]Send photos.
[47:43.97]Did I even pick photos?
[47:46.77]Oh, here we go.
[47:47.43]I get a picture.
[47:47.96]There we go.
[47:48.34]Okay, okay.
[47:49.76]So this is the good one I wanted.
[47:51.80]Send that one.
[47:53.70]Send.
[47:56.81]Result.
[47:58.77]Clear.
[48:00.09]Good angle.
[48:00.91]Excellent target.
[48:01.91]Marvelous distance and marvelous technique.
[48:04.51]$3,000.
[48:07.27]Animal added to Geo Africa mode.
[48:08.85]Thompson's Gazelle.
[48:12.08]Okay.
[48:12.26]We got more.
[48:16.20]We're going to send you a picture of the giraffe.
[48:22.00]This is a bad angle, but it's okay.
[48:23.18]I'm going to use it.
[48:29.10]That great angle.
[48:30.16]Marvelous.
[48:30.90]Marvelous.
[48:31.68]Excellent.
[48:33.74]Look at all the space above the giraffe.
[48:35.52]This is a bad picture.
[48:44.42]Okay, out of the, uh, Maasai giraffe.
[48:46.12]Let's do it again.
[48:51.68]Uh... What if I just send him a picture of, like, my friend giving the thumbs up?
[48:58.56]What's he gonna do?
[49:01.82]Alright, let's just say, hey, what do you think about this photo?
[49:04.08]Let's see what they say.
[49:15.23]Failed.
[49:16.45]Oh, well, sorry.
[49:17.27]Here's, like, the bird one.
[49:22.49]Which one?
[49:22.89]This bird or this bird?
[49:24.23]This one's probably more clear.
[49:25.17]Even though it's not at all...
[49:29.23]And that is of... Bad angle.
[49:34.15]It is a pretty bad angle, but at least I cleared it.
[49:36.19]With a B. Uh, Labbit-Faced Vulture.
[49:41.12]Okay.
[49:45.48]So anytime you see a new animal... Did we even do the zebra yet?
[49:51.40]What is this of?
[49:52.93]No.
[49:53.09]I don't think I even did the zebras.
[50:00.23]Excellent angle.
[50:01.17]Marvelous.
[50:02.05]Marvelous.
[50:02.75]Marvelous.
[50:03.11]Alright, I already did it.
[50:09.15]So what did I not send?
[50:10.41]The other gazelles, right?
[50:12.49]Like, these?
[50:13.51]Yeah.
[50:23.50]Bad angle.
[50:26.50]How do you have good distance?
[50:29.89]There's another iPad picture, yep.
[50:36.71]I have money.
[50:37.30]Let me go in my photo gallery.
[50:40.60]I gotta start deleting shit.
[50:43.32]Delete.
[50:44.82]Delete this.
[50:45.60]Delete.
[50:46.28]Delete.
[50:46.82]Delete.
[50:47.56]Delete.
[50:48.00]Wait, keep that one.
[50:50.04]I think we already got them.
[50:50.77]We got them all.
[50:58.97]Let me just see, make sure... Maybe I can get a better angle on Turkey?
[51:03.59]Whatever the hell this thing is?
[51:04.40]Because that is a vulture too, right?
[51:08.58]Maybe I'll get a better grade?
[51:10.02]Well, we improved the grade.
[51:25.39]Let's see what the save is now.
[51:28.45]308.
[51:28.63]I have to do it.
[51:30.28]No, we don't.
[51:30.68]Not yet.
[51:33.90]Alright, what have I got for money?
[51:36.60]Photo frame, photo storage.
[51:38.44]That's all I have unlocked right now.
[51:41.98]$48,000 for a photo storage device.
[51:46.16]$68,000 for a photo frame.
[51:49.46]That's kind of ridiculous.
[51:50.50]Alright.
[51:52.61]Transfer photos to laptop PC to free up space on your camera.
[51:56.32]As long as there's room, your photos will be automatically transferred when you use the PC.
[52:01.14]By the way, I prepared a map of the area.
[52:02.82]We can fill the map out as we discover new areas.
[52:06.20]Great first day out there.
[52:07.09]Let's rest up and get an early start tomorrow.
[52:10.77]Time for bed.
[52:22.22]Alright.
[52:22.58]Good morning, Francine.
[52:23.42]The real work starts today.
[52:25.26]Oh, I'll leave the survey log on the bookshelf.
[52:27.66]You may want to review it from time to time.
[52:31.65]What do you mean, like, right now?
[52:33.23]View safari log, camera manual, and magazines featuring your photos.
[52:37.35]In National Geographic.
[52:39.37]The grandma joke in the group chat is going to be a reality.
[52:46.59]Survey log.
[52:47.09]This is a log of the progress of the survey of the Manianga Conservation Area.
[52:52.53]This lookup guide explains various camera functions and defines expert camera lingo.
[53:01.45]Camera shake.
[53:02.58]Basic photography.
[53:06.12]Okay, remaining image.
[53:07.08]Make sure I know what this is going on.
[53:08.68]Left stick is angle.
[53:10.86]Right stick, up and down.
[53:11.90]Wait a minute.
[53:15.61]Today's advice, if you think your photo's good, chances are it is.
[53:19.27]What about type F?
[53:20.55]We don't need to know about that.
[53:21.93]Camera shake.
[53:25.92]Let's talk about a nasty little problem that can wreck your hard-won photos.
[53:30.16]You guessed it, camera shake.
[53:31.06]If your hands jiggle while you snap the picture, your photos are blurred.
[53:35.42]Increase the shutter speed or try pressing the shutter more gently.
[53:41.38]So that's why these pictures have been shitty.
[53:44.84]shooting vertically what vertical photos are fun to take no they're not this is like every photographer will tell you that don't ever take a photo with your iPhone vertical I guess this is like a nice iPhone though from the Viewfinder try holding the controller in a vertical position um I don't even know if I can do that with this controller and then photo storage
[54:15.67]Pictures you take are saved to your photo storage.
[54:17.19]All your photos go to the same storage, so even if you change cameras, you'll have the same number of shots remaining.
[54:25.59]30 shots in the storage.
[54:26.49]If you want to take more, you need to import some of your photos into the Jumbo Navi, or let's delete to clear up space.
[54:30.94]Alright, useful information.
[54:36.94]My survey begins!
[54:42.50]Oh, this is your player record.
[54:43.80]Total time played, day of survey, photos taken, missions cleared.
[54:47.50]Surveyed five types of animals.
[54:48.92]My ranking is Vervet Monkey.
[54:52.74]Okay.
[54:54.58]This is gonna be fun.
[54:55.80]Let's do it.
[54:56.22]How do I do anything?
[54:56.76]Alright, Eric.
[55:00.90]Alright, what about the map, right?
[55:06.00]View map of the locations you've explored.
[55:12.37]Okay, so there's a... Look at all this.
[55:14.49]Look at all that up there.
[55:15.37]There's so much.
[55:17.91]I'm gonna beat this whole game today.
[55:19.85]Well, no, I'm not, but I'll play it for a while.
[55:22.22]Hippo pool, base camp.
[55:23.36]We gotta go to the hippo pool, right?
[55:26.48]Base camp, hippo pool.
[55:28.20]Closest water source from base camp.
[55:29.88]Favorite spot for hippopotamus.
[55:32.86]Hippopotamus is a fucking dangerous, though.
[55:37.00]They look almost like a vicious animal on Earth.
[55:41.50]Alright, let's see.
[55:42.66]Any new emails?
[55:44.96]I do.
[55:45.18]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[55:48.11]Alright.
[55:48.29]Research.
[55:48.95]Herd of... We need a herd of gazelles.
[55:52.59]Hi Francine, nice to meet you.
[55:54.29]Since you're doing research on the Dumas Steppe, I had a favor to ask you.
[55:57.21]Are you familiar with an animal called the Thompson Gazelle?
[55:59.79]They favor flat plains with a wide view and live in herds of several dozen head or more.
[56:04.00]Could you photograph one of these herds for us so we can study their behavior on the Dumas Steppe?
[56:08.10]By the way, I've attached a really good photo and an amazing, in fact, video of a herd of them.
[56:13.54]But I'm just trying to flex on you to see if you can even come remotely close to my incredible skill.
[56:19.16]Thank you.
[56:19.62]Have a nice day.
[56:23.75]Uh, okay, we need a herd.
[56:24.57]Okay, let's take it.
[56:25.71]Accept this mission.
[56:26.95]Yes.
[56:27.85]Herd of gazelles.
[56:30.47]Planes with a wide view.
[56:34.14]So we got that one.
[56:34.82]Can we do more than one?
[56:38.78]This is the project head office.
[56:40.38]Thanks for that photo you sent to the plane zebra.
[56:42.59]Could we ask you to take another one with a little more detail?
[56:45.87]We want to study the stripes on the plane zebra's face.
[56:48.85]So we need a face shot taken from head on.
[56:51.73]There's no rush, just send me one when you have time.
[56:56.13]Yeah, like the one we just sent you.
[57:00.35]Good day, Francine.
[57:01.01]My name is Maliwi Essien.
[57:03.29]I am researching Savannah wildlife ecology.
[57:05.79]I caught wind of your studies on the Dumas Steppe and was hoping I might ask you a favor.
[57:09.16]I wish to teach my students how to identify a topi, but I need a photograph first.
[57:15.14]Topis have a distinct black pattern at the base of their legs.
[57:18.14]Could you take a picture from the side that shows this?
[57:20.20]Okay.
[57:23.93]So this is just side missions.
[57:27.33]Uh, the Maasai giraffe photo you sent us the other day was quite nice.
[57:29.61]You're already creating a buzz around the office.
[57:31.84]When we showed the photo to a bottled water manufacturer, they expressed an interest in seeing a photo of a giraffe drinking water.
[57:39.44]Can you manage this additional request?
[57:42.10]Yeah?
[57:44.44]Alright, we need... so, what do we need?
[57:46.04]Oh, I can only take one mission at a time.
[57:47.40]Alright.
[57:48.02]That one's better.
[57:49.34]Giraffe drinking water.
[57:51.50]And then if I come across a zebra, take a picture of its face, and we're looking for, um, looking for, um, different, uh, discolorations on the, on the, we're looking for a topi with the legs.
[58:07.10]Alright.
[58:08.28]Photo of a giraffe drinking water.
[58:12.10]And this is also just take pictures of any new animal.
[58:14.40]It's just permanently there.
[58:16.08]Alright, let's go.
[58:20.37]Alright, stalk a giraffe.
[58:21.21]I can't wait to get a dangerous shot.
[58:57.70]You know, it's just loading up all the photos.
[59:02.12]Yeah!
[59:06.50]Alright, where we going, James?
[59:08.86]Uh, JamboFrancine, this time we're photographing a giraffe drinking water, right?
[59:12.69]Let's go to Owali Oasis and wait for an opportunity.
[59:15.79]Go ahead, hop in the back, here we go.
[59:21.43]He just drives.
[59:24.05]Am I driving?
[59:28.35]If you ever want me to stop the car, press the L2 button to tell me.
[59:31.79]For your own safety, you can't get out of the car until it comes to a complete stop.
[59:36.15]So none of that GTA bullshit.
[59:39.27]Press the R2 button and I'll start driving again.
[59:42.81]Press circle to talk to me.
[59:46.60]Please be sure not to wander too far from the car.
[59:54.30]Alright, go!
[59:57.80]Giraffe drinking water.
[59:58.84]Alright, stop.
[60:06.48]We gotta get a picture of a hippo.
[60:14.47]How clo- Oh, he sees me.
[60:17.27]Is this like his aggression stance?
[60:28.01]I can get closer, I think.
[60:35.13]Hippos can't run.
[60:44.56]Can hippos... Wait, hold on.
[60:47.20]Can I die?
[60:47.70]Hold on a minute.
[60:49.52]What does that mean?
[60:50.28]He's like burping at me.
[60:56.21]Alright, I'm just gonna get it.
[61:00.88]We get all of them.
[61:04.49]No, no, no, no.
[61:05.09]Wrong button.
[61:05.61]Why is it circled?
[61:08.61]Wait till he looks up.
[61:19.62]Wait, push it slightly, gently.
[61:29.09]Okay.
[61:30.69]Alright, let's go.
[61:31.09]Let's get out of this way.
[61:34.93]Charge the hippo.
[61:35.77]I'm not gonna charge the hippo, because if I die, and I have to reload a save, I haven't saved it in like an hour.
[61:43.66]Let me save it.
[61:47.06]We're driving right towards the hippos.
[61:50.42]Hey, look at that!
[61:51.70]See, the hippos are bathing at the hippo pool.
[61:53.68]It's a great chance for some photos.
[61:55.84]Hippos can be dangerous.
[61:57.24]Be careful when taking close shots.
[62:00.75]No, I already got it.
[62:01.63]Let's go.
[62:04.45]We don't want any hippos coming after us.
[62:05.89]Let's take a detour.
[62:09.69]He just drove straight at him.
[62:17.06]Hippos can run literally like a horse.
[62:20.46]Yeah, but they're like a train.
[62:22.46]It takes them like a mile to slow down.
[62:25.20]They run with like five billion pounds.
[62:35.85]Why are you stopping?
[62:37.49]Get us to a giraffe.
[62:38.85]Now.
[62:41.91]Isn't that even worse?
[62:49.28]Isn't the hippo actually the most dangerous animal in the world?
[62:56.54]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[63:00.09]Now, one of these giraffes has to take a drink.
[63:05.46]Bingo.
[63:08.53]Get in there.
[63:09.13]Donk your head.
[63:17.84]Let's... Okay, hold on.
[63:21.06]Hold on.
[63:22.00]No, no, no.
[63:22.50]We could get a better one.
[63:32.90]Yeah, the level of detail loading with the frame rate in the background.
[63:35.99]Well, yeah, it's to keep, uh... It's to keep the CPU cool.
[63:43.97]None of these animals are dangerous.
[63:44.95]I'll be fine.
[63:49.56]Come on, come on.
[63:50.26]I gotta get in the magazine.
[63:51.04]No, I gotta get in the bottle of water.
[63:55.42]Fuck!
[63:56.66]Do it again.
[63:59.46]Oh, this is a great shot.
[64:04.20]Go down one more time.
[64:08.64]This is a good framing.
[64:10.58]Like, at the water, the distance.
[64:12.02]What the hell was that?
[64:14.38]He just lifted his leg up to pee.
[64:22.34]Oh, you asshole.
[64:23.74]You already... Alright, hey, hey, hey, hold on.
[64:25.76]This'll be good.
[64:30.71]If I get two of them, that's gonna look great.
[64:40.95]Go into that water.
[64:46.78]He's getting so close, dude.
[64:47.68]This is going to be perfect.
[64:52.21]Look at that background, too.
[64:56.63]That'll go on the front of a bottle of water.
[64:58.33]I can guarantee it.
[65:01.60]Just in case.
[65:02.06]Just in case.
[65:02.44]Hold on.
[65:14.11]I gotta get in the front of the zebra's face.
[65:15.96]How the hell am I gonna get that?
[65:19.08]They get so scared, and they just run off.
[65:23.64]Can I get like a different costume to make me hide or something?
[65:30.09]Just wait, they'll get in here.
[65:37.14]This counts as a right in front of the face, right?
[65:44.81]Come on.
[65:47.60]I'm just a statue.
[65:48.32]They don't even know I'm here.
[66:01.09]Got it.
[66:06.79]I need a better lens.
[66:07.61]Alright, what was the last thing to get?
[66:09.33]Let me try it one more time.
[66:16.25]Perfect.
[66:16.93]Oh, this is going to be good.
[66:19.14]Leave me alone.
[66:19.52]What the fuck are you doing?
[66:20.54]Leave me alone.
[66:21.04]What are you doing?
[66:23.08]I had it lined up perfectly.
[66:25.36]And you just tethered me back here.
[66:28.72]Oh, god damn it.
[66:29.34]Whatever.
[66:29.60]I've got to get the topi, right?
[66:32.10]Let me take a look at those photos.
[66:35.25]Just make sure they're fucking clean.
[66:39.43]That's good.
[66:42.47]That one's really good.
[66:44.21]It's definitely this one.
[66:47.01]Too far away.
[66:47.59]No.
[66:50.55]That's a good one.
[66:52.23]This camera sucks.
[67:00.23]That's the good one.
[67:01.83]Somebody said rule of thirds is a myth and makes your photos look like shit.
[67:05.06]What do you mean it's a myth?
[67:16.61]Alright, let's go find... I really want to get the zebra.
[67:20.93]Right in the face.
[67:24.04]Let me try that one more.
[67:24.88]I gotta get that.
[67:25.78]I can't just go.
[67:27.24]Look, maybe if he drives the car a little bit closer, he won't be like, Get back here!
[67:31.28]You're too far away!
[67:38.59]Stop.
[67:39.77]This one right here.
[67:47.40]You just gotta get right in their path.
[67:56.48]I had it too, and it just landed in a loading screen.
[68:15.94]I had it set up, like, two different times.
[68:20.50]And that guy just... Dude, be careful!
[68:22.34]You're going too far!
[68:26.56]Whatever, I... It's close enough.
[68:27.97]I had to see two different loading screens when I had the shit ready to go.
[68:37.69]It's cause he was worried about you.
[68:44.38]Don't be worried about me.
[68:45.36]I'm a fucking Francine.
[68:46.96]No, don't go back to the base camp.
[68:49.62]Actually, yeah.
[68:50.89]Go back to the base camp.
[68:53.55]I'm looking for a... Topi.
[69:00.07]Is that one right there?
[69:00.69]I think there's one right here.
[69:06.32]Can I go that far?
[69:07.70]Stop.
[69:09.92]That's definitely one right here.
[69:11.74]Does it have the same pattern that they want?
[69:21.07]I can't tell.
[69:21.63]I think it does.
[69:22.13]Yeah, it does.
[69:27.64]Get in there.
[69:32.52]Alright, just in case it runs away, let's get like a dogshit grandma photo.
[69:37.83]Just so we can at least prove that we did it.
[69:46.90]Don't you fucking dare pull me back right now.
[69:50.58]You fucking asshole.
[69:51.72]Stop this.
[69:52.56]I have a perfect opportunity.
[69:53.88]Do not pull me back.
[69:59.04]They want a side profile.
[70:01.88]Got it.
[70:10.15]Zoom in.
[70:10.57]I have default camera.
[70:12.29]I can't go that far.
[70:14.23]Can I get closer?
[70:20.03]God, oh god, it's perfect.
[70:22.50]Stay right there, don't move.
[70:27.54]Alright, now get out of here!
[70:39.07]Take us back to camp.
[70:40.39]I should have every photo I need.
[70:49.29]Are you being so nasty?
[70:50.41]No, I'm trying to get him away.
[70:51.43]Man, look at all the predators around.
[70:53.75]He's standing still from my photo.
[70:55.51]No, get out of here.
[70:56.17]Go.
[70:56.41]Go back to your family.
[71:07.36]In real life, you would have died 30 minutes ago.
[71:11.85]This ain't real life, though.
[71:19.25]Yeah, I'll save it now.
[71:27.57]The hippo would have just snapped you in half.
[71:34.77]I need to get a huge lens.
[71:36.43]Yeah, once we start making money I can start buying stuff.
[71:46.82]Get a six foot camera lens.
[71:51.28]I don't know if I can get a comedy lens.
[71:59.55]How was the safari?
[72:00.81]You look satisfied with the photos you took.
[72:02.23]Let's examine them, make sure we get the right ones, send the right ones in our emails.
[72:13.58]That was a loud, dangerous sound, I don't know if you guys heard that.
[72:16.14]Okay, let's go to the laptop.
[72:20.35]Let's see.
[72:21.11]Photos.
[72:23.69]Transferring photos.
[72:26.18]Okay.
[72:28.00]Let's take a look.
[72:30.90]So, uh, request just came in.
[72:32.84]This is for a drinking giraffe.
[72:36.17]I do have a photo.
[72:39.33]And it is, which one was it?
[72:40.23]Let's see.
[72:40.67]View.
[72:41.31]We got this one.
[72:41.97]And then this one.
[72:47.26]That's the only two I got, right?
[72:49.33]Yeah, this one's too... too far away.
[72:52.07]Too hazy and far away.
[72:53.17]There's other animals in the shot, too.
[72:54.87]Yeah, this is terrible.
[72:58.07]It's this one.
[73:02.70]Select this one.
[73:03.88]That's the one.
[73:04.48]That's gotta be a great angle.
[73:12.78]How is that not better?
[73:14.62]Distances?
[73:16.12]Angle?
[73:17.12]That's not a good angle.
[73:20.59]I got a C for that picture.
[73:21.85]That's a beautiful piece of photography right there.
[73:26.13]Didn't get the full 20 grand.
[73:27.19]It's alright.
[73:30.37]This one is done.
[73:30.99]It should have been in the center.
[73:34.55]Yeah, rule of thirds is fucking bullshit.
[73:37.33]Maybe that guy's right?
[73:41.36]We didn't get the herd of the gazelles yet.
[73:43.84]This is the side profile of that topi.
[73:51.30]Which was... Let's take a look.
[73:59.29]I don't like this photo, though.
[74:01.07]It's ugly.
[74:01.99]This one's better.
[74:02.59]This one kind of looks like shit.
[74:14.89]Yeah, that's definitely a better picture.
[74:20.37]The color correction is awful.
[74:23.05]This one's better?
[74:23.88]I feel like the tree in the background and the dirt in the background is screwing up the composition there.
[74:30.84]Look at the dirt and the sand in the background.
[74:33.74]And his face is not clear, not defined with the tree in the background.
[74:37.61]This one's better.
[74:41.89]That's the one I'm sending.
[74:52.13]Good.
[74:53.85]Told you guys.
[74:54.37]Come on.
[74:56.29]They weren't asking for a face shot.
[74:58.87]They were asking for just a side profile.
[75:01.37]That's going against what the client asked and what the client was paying for.
[75:13.62]This one, on the other hand, I didn't get.
[75:15.22]Let me see.
[75:19.22]Face shot from head on.
[75:25.89]Mm-mm.
[75:27.65]That's not, no.
[75:28.97]Mm-mm.
[75:29.25]That's not right.
[75:32.48]That's not, that's not correct.
[75:34.72]If that's what they want, then that's not what they got.
[75:43.42]So let's, just for curiosity, I can't even do it.
[75:46.01]You can only do these missions once.
[75:48.49]Send it anyway?
[75:49.17]No, no, because you only get to do them once.
[75:53.02]But we do have new photos.
[75:54.44]It's 3,000 per new animal, which we have hippos here.
[76:04.69]They both suck.
[76:07.99]There's the turkey.
[76:11.34]Probably this one.
[76:14.02]This one sucks.
[76:14.68]At least this one has a face.
[76:27.71]Bad distance... I mean, kind of okay distance and technique, not really though.
[76:35.18]Hippopotamus.
[76:37.18]And was there any others that I didn't get?
[76:39.40]That were in... No, we got them all.
[76:43.70]Alright, I'll delete all these.
[76:45.84]Get rid of these fucking things.
[76:48.04]I need the herd of gazelles and a face shot of a zebra.
[76:59.13]So let me go back.
[77:01.90]Let's get rid of these.
[77:07.76]Delete them.
[77:11.81]Okay.
[77:12.49]Transfer this one.
[77:17.95]How do I just transfer this?
[77:19.53]Can I just pull... I want to keep this one.
[77:28.76]I can't, like, keep this one forever?
[77:32.04]Or does it just sit in here?
[77:32.86]If I go shopping, shopping.
[77:36.56]I wanna go shopping.
[77:40.94]Hit X. I was pressing X. It didn't do anything.
[77:44.30]Free shipping around the world.
[77:46.12]Wouldn't that be interesting?
[77:46.82]I don't have enough money.
[77:47.96]Save.
[77:53.78]Press X when in the transfer screen.
[77:55.14]I was.
[77:55.46]I was pressing X. Didn't do anything.
[78:04.42]Broke?
[78:04.76]Well, I just started.
[78:05.42]Have I caught all the Pokémon yet?
[78:14.87]No.
[78:17.93]Not yet.
[78:20.87]Don't you have camera experience from the wedding jobs you took?
[78:23.75]In real life?
[78:24.49]Well, I have video experience, not photo experience.
[78:30.14]They're in the same kind of category, but they're kind of like cousins.
[78:36.15]Recording something that is potentially moving around and distance and location and lighting is a lot different when you're instead of still picture God this is painful to save
[78:59.65]The save time.
[79:00.83]Yeah, if you're just joining us, for some reason there's a 400 megabyte save file, and there's nothing I can do about it.
[79:05.60]It's the rarest... Whatever, the joke that people get angry at, because I said it like five times in the first 20 minutes of the stream.
[79:12.74]Alright, that's good.
[79:15.82]Let's go.
[79:17.32]I feel like I go to sleep, right?
[79:19.86]New day?
[79:26.24]Can I look at the cameras?
[79:27.38]Can I do anything with the camera?
[79:28.94]Can I buy something for this?
[79:31.32]Type F. No, I need to buy a new camera.
[79:35.83]Alright, let's go to bed.
[79:45.25]F, F, F, F, F, F, F. This lazy shit just reads while I take photos.
[79:56.46]There's elephants down there.
[79:57.40]Look at... There's elephants.
[79:59.93]There's probably like T-Rexes and shit.
[80:01.45]Alright, we need the... Wait, wait, wait.
[80:05.93]I gotta take that mission first.
[80:08.81]We're probably gonna have a bunch of... Yeah, we got a bunch of emails now.
[80:12.84]Alright.
[80:14.46]We got two opportunities.
[80:15.80]This one's boring.
[80:18.12]The ultimate big mouth.
[80:21.36]My name is Joe Rivera.
[80:22.64]I write for Amazing Animals, a monthly magazine that covers wildlife's most charming moments, from absurd to zany and everything in between.
[80:29.89]Let me cut right to the chase.
[80:31.33]I was hoping you could take a photo for our popular Most Wanted Mugshots column.
[80:35.69]We need a shot of a hippo yawning.
[80:38.18]Wait for it to open wide.
[80:45.22]Okay.
[80:46.30]I'll do it.
[80:47.10]That one's more interesting.
[80:51.84]Okay, we need the close-up of the face and a hippo yawning.
[80:58.30]We got it.
[80:58.68]Hey, uh, let the professional decide what they're going to do.
[81:01.58]Mr., like, reading Harry Potter start to finish.
[81:29.76]God, I don't have my way.
[81:32.40]I have a thing that I put on the ground, a wheel.
[81:35.52]And I took it out because I VR-ified my room.
[81:38.42]So, it's like I'm glued to the ground right now.
[81:50.59]Okay.
[81:53.27]Uh, hello, Francine.
[81:54.82]We're looking for hippos this time, right?
[81:56.64]Oh, Jumbo.
[81:58.93]If it's not far, but let me take you to the hippo pool, go ahead and hop in the back.
[82:04.61]Snap a yawning hippopotamus.
[82:08.46]I'm gonna try.
[82:18.51]How do hippos... I'm not gonna read that, but I don't know.
[82:21.33]I have no idea.
[82:21.93]I don't know, maybe they just... I don't know.
[82:29.67]Okay, let's go.
[82:31.33]Uh, go hide in a bush.
[82:38.22]When the screen flashes red, I'm getting too close.
[82:44.80]There comes a big yawn.
[82:52.87]Am I hidden right now?
[82:54.35]This one seems pretty alerted.
[83:08.81]I got it.
[83:09.25]I got a pretty good video of that hippo coming to kill me.
[83:14.51]You wake up in the fucking... Oh, you alright?
[83:17.31]No photo is worth risking life and limb over.
[83:31.52]You finally awake.
[83:37.45]Hey, I didn't get your yawning hippo, but I got a great YouTube, like Facebook video of that.
[83:44.75]That's going to be shared 50 million times.
[83:47.27]Let's try it again.
[84:07.31]So, is it hiding the blood?
[84:08.21]I gotta be very, very careful.
[84:10.07]And very patient.
[84:15.49]Uh, for a second at the top, I thought that said, stop a yawning hippopotamus.
[84:21.48]Stop them from yawning.
[84:22.28]What am I supposed to do?
[84:30.34]Let's go.
[84:31.62]This time, I'm gonna be very cautious.
[84:36.88]They're all turning the other way.
[84:42.70]Yawning hippo.
[84:45.12]That one right in the middle.
[84:46.44]Or on the left.
[84:54.05]One on the left.
[84:58.35]That's not a bad shot.
[85:02.31]Not a bad shot if you just open your mouth.
[85:04.39]I gotta wait for it.
[85:06.44]If he lifts his head up over the bush, that would look so good.
[85:24.69]Who's gonna do it?
[85:34.96]Okay, which one of you, like, thumbs is gonna open your mouth?
[85:46.73]I can't get closer than this.
[85:52.41]Do it!
[85:57.43]Zoom in, this is fi- I have the default camera, I can't go in any further.
[86:00.86]And if I get closer, they'll attack me.
[86:11.93]Look, I'm going to come out of the camera mode and then I'm going to do it.
[86:19.28]Oh, yeah.
[86:19.72]You yawn first.
[86:20.40]That's right.
[86:27.93]No?
[86:28.25]Did it work?
[86:42.98]Yawn.
[86:47.47]Somebody yawn!
[86:59.58]I can't get closer!
[87:01.50]Last time I got closer, they tried to kill me.
[87:10.87]No, this one just went to bed.
[87:15.94]Come on, somebody do it.
[87:17.14]They're both asleep.
[87:28.60]Wait.
[87:36.70]You just woke... Okay, that's actually not a bad thing.
[87:38.46]You just woke this one up.
[87:40.74]Maybe it'll do a, I just woke up yawn?
[87:44.49]No, don't turn the other direction.
[87:48.77]They're behind you.
[87:55.09]Where are you going?
[88:01.50]Turn this way.
[88:03.36]It has to be you.
[88:14.47]No, no, no, no.
[88:15.37]Don't obstruct it from the...
[88:24.63]Shot ruined.
[88:25.19]I'm gonna have to get this one over here.
[88:48.68]Yawn.
[88:50.42]Oh, this is not a bad shot.
[88:51.50]Come on, do it!
[88:54.46]You just woke up.
[88:55.48]This is your opportunity to yawn.
[88:56.98]Do it.
[89:05.60]How much is this one?
[89:16.85]You're the only one left in the pool.
[89:18.53]Please just yawn.
[89:21.09]When is your AI gonna understand that it's time to yawn?
[89:31.26]Is that those yawns?
[89:35.97]No, it's a huge thing.
[89:37.47]They go like... They look like a snake when they do it.
[89:41.11]The jaws unhinge.
[89:42.68]And they like swallow an egg.
[89:48.64]I don't think that was a yawn.
[89:49.58]I could probably pass it off as one though.
[89:54.90]The mouth is open.
[89:55.98]Whoops, that's a... I don't want to do a vertical.
[90:05.07]Great.
[90:12.28]Wait, wait, wait, he's turning around.
[90:15.80]This is good.
[90:16.90]This is really good, really good, really good.
[90:18.08]Do it.
[90:18.86]No, no, no, no, no.
[90:19.88]This way.
[90:20.64]Turn around.
[90:21.22]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[90:27.87]Wait, wait, wait for him to land.
[90:29.03]Wait for him to land.
[90:29.71]Okay.
[90:39.37]That was a yawn?
[90:40.05]Coming up?
[90:40.49]Nope.
[90:54.94]Get out of here!
[90:57.85]That gazelle just ruined everything.
[91:00.03]Oh, you know what?
[91:00.43]That's... I'm going to take this as a good picture.
[91:02.64]Right?
[91:03.16]Why not just take that?
[91:08.14]That's a good turning profile picture.
[91:17.02]Where's the other hippo?
[91:21.61]Just still sitting there.
[91:24.75]Isn't there a third hippo?
[91:37.01]This really is what... You guys think this is... Oh, wow, this is boring.
[91:41.16]I've seen, like, planet Earth.
[91:43.20]I've seen the National Geographic stuff.
[91:45.10]It's so much more interesting than this.
[91:46.44]No, it isn't.
[91:49.62]To get the photo of the hippopotamus yawning...
[91:53.35]and have it really look cool and on like the National Geographic PBS stuff.
[91:58.00]Somebody comes out here and does this for like six straight days.
[92:00.74]Just hang out here and they just eat like sandwiches.
[92:12.54]But you want to know why that's so difficult to do?
[92:15.10]Because think about that.
[92:16.42]There is one moment that you have to be ready to take the photo.
[92:20.42]And it might take up to five straight days before you get it.
[92:23.86]At any point in those five days.
[92:26.19]You've got to be like, oh shit!
[92:27.81]And like grab, like snap!
[92:28.81]Because you might be sitting there for like 16 hours.
[92:32.63]That's hard.
[92:34.25]Will you open your mouth and yawn please?
[92:42.47]There's the other one.
[92:43.41]Do a double yawn.
[92:45.19]Do like a Dragon Ball Z fusion yawn together.
[92:47.65]Come on.
[92:47.99]This is a bad photo.
[92:57.51]I have to move.
[93:04.49]This is a hippopotamus, right?
[93:05.77]I just want to be like, yes, yes, it is.
[93:08.37]Because they're not yawning.
[93:17.04]These are elephants.
[93:18.44]These are baby elephants.
[93:19.66]They could be.
[93:20.78]But what if they... Good.
[93:23.38]Now yawn together.
[93:25.04]One, two, three, yawn.
[93:27.61]Can they see me?
[93:28.87]Is that why they're not doing this?
[93:32.97]Is that why they're not comfortable enough to yawn because I'm sitting here?
[93:40.05]They said... The guy told me to hide in a bush.
[93:44.82]He said, hide in a bush.
[93:47.70]Only these bushes are here.
[93:51.98]Bingo.
[93:58.10]You aren't in a bush.
[93:59.66]I can't take a photo inside the bush.
[94:03.76]Alright, I'm in the bush.
[94:04.94]Cool.
[94:05.38]Let's take a photo.
[94:07.38]This is good.
[94:24.36]Ooh.
[94:26.63]Dude, this is good.
[94:27.73]This depth of field here.
[94:29.43]Come on, open your mouth.
[94:31.07]Please.
[94:44.10]Do it!
[94:52.15]That's not depth of field, it's low resolution.
[94:55.05]Well, whatever.
[94:59.19]How are you not... Here it comes.
[95:03.27]I gotta be ready.
[95:07.39]What was that?
[95:07.87]What?
[95:08.53]Was that a fast yawn?
[95:09.50]That was like a super fast forward fast forward motion yawn!
[95:14.76]I'm so angry.
[95:36.52]Just like in real life.
[95:40.72]I almost wasn't ready.
[95:44.08]Do it.
[95:46.38]Come on.
[95:47.54]He's getting right into frame.
[95:48.92]Right now.
[95:49.30]Stop.
[95:49.76]Open the mouth.
[95:50.38]Let's go.
[95:50.85]Come on.
[95:52.31]Don't get blocked by the low res grass bush thing.
[95:55.27]Don't do it.
[95:55.67]Do it.
[95:56.87]Here we go.
[95:57.25]One.
[95:57.91]Two.
[95:58.13]Three.
[96:09.10]Do it!
[96:15.06]Is that gonna be blurry?
[96:23.86]Why?
[96:24.68]Wait!
[96:26.40]Yes!
[96:27.34]Perfect!
[96:30.30]See you later!
[96:33.97]Check him first.
[96:34.59]Hold on.
[96:34.99]Check him, check him, check him.
[96:39.11]Good.
[96:40.29]That's the best one.
[96:47.54]Look at that one.
[96:55.32]The rest of these are just not... I don't even know what these are.
[96:57.97]I was taking a photo trying to time the mouth opening, and I didn't get it once.
[97:04.07]I almost got it right there.
[97:12.34]I like these two.
[97:13.62]These just look like two terriers looking at me.
[97:20.50]I like this one.
[97:21.70]I do.
[97:26.25]Well, we got the thing we needed.
[97:28.71]What's the other mission we can do?
[97:29.69]Let's see.
[97:34.71]Yeah, get a shot of those.
[97:36.23]Zebra.
[97:38.51]And a herd of gazelles.
[97:39.55]I need a zebra.
[97:40.53]I need to get that zebra shot.
[97:41.55]Let's go.
[97:43.74]No, go back to the camp.
[97:46.32]You can't take me a little bit further out?
[97:51.25]Why?
[97:51.69]Why can you not take me further out?
[97:55.49]Zebra right here.
[97:59.17]And I can't go that far away.
[98:04.76]Let's just turn this one in.
[98:07.48]Was it inevitable?
[98:09.46]Was it inevitable?
[98:10.40]Was it inevitable?
[98:13.36]I think it was inevitable.
[98:14.18]Uh-oh.
[98:24.01]We're going back down to zero, boys and girls.
[98:36.08]I got the photo.
[98:53.86]Is it good?
[98:55.18]No.
[99:00.16]Wait, we're back.
[99:05.21]Jerma is disappearing.
[99:06.27]Quick, get in.
[99:14.57]It was a long drive, but we made it.
[99:19.26]Yeah, we have some other issues going on here.
[99:25.72]Something got fucked up.
[99:28.96]Something definitely got, like, really fucked up, because that, like, we're seeing some odd shit at this residence, I'll tell ya.
[99:34.90]Alright, Safari was good.
[99:40.87]That was me.
[99:42.53]Alright, let's go take, uh, let's get these out of here.
[99:51.44]Is this whole game just to sell people Sony cameras?
[99:55.41]Um, no.
[99:57.74]Sony?
[99:58.86]These Sony cameras?
[100:01.34]They don't look like Sony.
[100:02.86]Is that a Sony video camera?
[100:05.20]You know what I mean by that.
[100:09.50]But none of you guys are gonna buy this shit.
[100:10.88]This is like 12 years ago.
[100:12.54]Alright, this is the one we're gonna use.
[100:16.25]Oh, wait, hold on.
[100:16.77]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:24.17]It's doing a poor job.
[100:25.29]Alright.
[100:25.53]$20,000.
[100:26.06]We got the yawn.
[100:26.84]I think we're ready to go.
[100:31.76]Let's take a look.
[100:35.30]Uh... I don't know.
[100:37.06]This is tough, because here's the problem.
[100:39.37]This one is definitely way more pronounced.
[100:42.21]But this one is centered.
[100:45.27]The mouth is actually... You can see down, like, the urinal.
[100:57.10]The tilted one is a big... What about over here?
[101:02.32]Nah, not these ones.
[101:08.38]This one has more emotion behind it.
[101:10.19]That's really tired.
[101:17.47]But yeah, somebody said the game is probably coded for looking down the PVC pipe.
[101:32.43]I like this photo better, but this one's probably worth more points.
[101:41.19]I'm going with that one.
[101:43.52]I'm going with my gut here.
[101:49.12]Target, distance, excellent technique.
[101:51.22]Okay.
[101:53.86]Alright, no, that's alright.
[101:54.82]That's good.
[101:55.34]I got exactly what I came in for.
[101:56.88]20 grand.
[102:02.59]Oh, oh yeah, by the way, sorry for telling you, the pre-stream was a little odd.
[102:07.37]Because I'm just sitting there going, yeah, we're wearing the bright red, there's no stream today.
[102:12.80]No stream, stream's not happening today, is what I said in the chat.
[102:15.80]And then I got green.
[102:17.28]And then, like, the problem was fixed.
[102:18.94]And then we, like, me and Etalyx were talking about how we can, like, kill bandwidth to each other now somehow, which wasn't really, like, necessarily a problem before.
[102:28.52]And we got like fucking 60 plus mile per hour winds in Vegas.
[102:33.36]It was raining.
[102:33.92]I don't know, there's a lot of weird shit going on.
[102:35.78]So there's a bunch, there's probably like more than two or three problems, but I was told that we're gonna get fixed today.
[102:40.08]So, we'll see.
[102:43.35]Alright, so let me... I got $63,000.
[102:47.39]Should I get more photo storage or just save it?
[102:51.29]Maybe I have to buy this to unlock the next couple of things to buy.
[103:02.44]Alright, we'll save it.
[103:04.22]So, let's go to sleep.
[103:05.04]See what we get in the morning.
[103:06.59]See what new missions we get.
[103:08.99]Yeah, apparently Valentine's Day broke a rain record.
[103:18.72]Like, across all of Vegas.
[103:20.76]It was raining everywhere.
[103:21.54]Alright, what do you got for me today?
[103:26.66]Nothing.
[103:26.88]You're still on the same page in the book.
[103:34.10]Alright, head.
[103:34.96]We gotta get this.
[103:37.93]Yeah, we have to just get the herd.
[103:39.97]Take it.
[103:41.05]Herd of gazelles.
[103:47.11]And the zebra head.
[103:51.90]Let's go, let's take a look at the map.
[103:53.50]We need to take a photo of the herd of gazelles.
[103:55.44]Look for a chance to capture as many gazelles as possible in one shot.
[104:05.65]So let's just go.
[104:06.45]Let's not pick a good place.
[104:07.43]I don't know why, but for one second I thought this just quit to my desktop and this was my desktop background.
[104:16.20]I don't know why I thought that.
[104:17.20]I was like, what the fuck?
[104:19.96]Why are we on my desktop?
[104:23.96]I don't know why.
[104:31.42]This is the standard Windows XP background.
[104:39.20]Yeah, this is the Dell computer background that has never changed in 10 years.
[104:43.44]Alright, let's take a picture of some gazelles.
[105:01.61]What is that?
[105:01.95]I...
[105:11.82]I don't know, it looks like a cat.
[105:22.28]It's gonna be so blurry.
[105:23.90]Can I look at them?
[105:31.29]Now this is- I was testing the white balance, that's what this photo is.
[105:34.27]I'm not taking pictures of anything, I'm just testing the camera to make sure I have enough battery to take a picture.
[105:52.20]That's a pretty nice big footprint.
[105:57.14]No.
[106:01.73]I need a better camera.
[106:09.77]Can't take photos out of the window of a car.
[106:11.50]Alright, where are these gazelles?
[106:15.62]I don't see a herd of gazelles anywhere.
[106:23.92]Oh!
[106:24.42]Stop!
[106:25.16]Stop!
[106:25.54]Stop!
[106:25.88]Stop!
[106:26.18]Oh!
[106:26.96]Okay.
[106:33.47]Let's get set up.
[106:36.53]Should they be running?
[106:38.69]It wants a stampede of gazelles, right?
[106:40.35]I think there's not... I gotta get as many as possible.
[106:47.60]We gotta back it up a little.
[107:02.52]That distance is bad.
[107:12.35]I got- I already got it.
[107:13.05]I got it.
[107:13.35]I already got it.
[107:14.49]I mean, that's a good photo, but it's not a whole- a whole herd.
[107:27.33]Alright, now make him run.
[107:40.31]I got it already, right?
[107:41.21]I already did it.
[107:41.71]Why does this look like shit?
[107:49.35]There's something wrong about this photo.
[107:50.56]Why does this look so off?
[107:55.94]No, get back in the car and drive me to where I need to go.
[108:04.25]There's too much ground in that photo.
[108:05.53]That's exactly what it is.
[108:06.93]Alright, take me to the tree.
[108:14.27]Okay, now I can walk a little further.
[108:21.69]What constitutes a herd?
[108:25.25]Is a herd three or more?
[108:28.88]At the umbrella tree.
[108:33.24]Three or more is a herd.
[108:41.30]At least fifteen.
[108:47.65]Alright, there's a couple right here.
[108:48.92]Let's get a little closer.
[108:57.24]Not bad, not bad.
[108:58.52]Turn, turn, turn, turn.
[108:59.84]Tilt.
[109:00.53]One on the top left.
[109:01.27]Turn a little.
[109:09.77]How many grains of sand is a beach?
[109:13.97]No, that's true.
[109:14.83]Just because it's in the sand, that doesn't mean it's a beach.
[109:17.75]No, it has to... I gotta go this way.
[109:25.97]That's bordering on a goddamn ocean!
[109:30.31]Let me go over here.
[109:34.64]I think I fucked up my opportunity to take a good picture.
[109:38.08]So they're getting the terrible one.
[109:40.38]It's just for like a classroom, right?
[109:42.34]Just students.
[109:50.13]They don't need a National Geographic quality photo.
[109:53.47]They just need a photo.
[110:01.76]Yeah, I scared them all off.
[110:03.85]There's one more down there.
[110:10.75]Yeah, I blew it.
[110:11.25]Let's go.
[110:21.98]I'm gonna have to use that terrible one.
[110:31.05]She probably stinks.
[110:36.61]What?
[110:37.11]What?
[110:50.83]Watch out!
[110:51.23]Watch out!
[110:51.71]Watch out!
[110:52.03]Don't run him over.
[110:52.65]There's definitely no animal run over physics.
[110:56.29]I would guarantee that's not the case.
[111:01.83]I got a photo.
[111:02.51]It's like a hundred degrees and you can't shower.
[111:14.50]You can, like, roll around in one of these little lakes.
[111:16.72]One of these little ponds.
[111:19.55]You can just, like, roll around in it with some, like, Dove.
[111:23.73]Just buy, like, his 25-pack of the Dove dog shit brand.
[111:33.73]Get, like, a Lever 2000 or something.
[111:35.08]Those things, it's like... It's probably, like, full...
[111:41.06]Don't, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop the car, stop the car, stop the car.
[111:43.37]Stop the car.
[111:44.50]Stop the car.
[111:45.18]Stop the car.
[111:46.56]Stop the car.
[112:53.05]Come on.
[112:53.55]Look over here.
[112:54.49]This is good.
[112:54.93]This is good.
[112:55.48]There's a little too much tree.
[112:58.34]Bingo.
[112:58.89]There's the shot right there.
[113:00.49]Maybe... Hold on.
[113:00.93]One more.
[113:01.21]One more.
[113:21.91]It's not even in focus.
[113:22.87]Yes, it is.
[113:24.37]We'll get one, like, dead on, too.
[113:27.09]We'll go, like, over here.
[113:31.00]Watch this shit.
[113:32.76]This is gonna be fucking beautiful.
[113:35.94]I'm just gonna get a little bit of leaf.
[113:37.12]A little bit of leaves in the foreground.
[113:46.85]I need a better lens.
[113:48.25]Oh, fuck, there's another one.
[113:49.13]Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[113:57.31]This is perfect.
[113:57.87]Look, it's like a cat sitting on a tree.
[113:59.15]Come on.
[113:59.97]Get the leafs.
[114:01.15]We need foreground, midground, background.
[114:05.53]No, no, this is not a good enough lens.
[114:06.85]I can't do what I want to do.
[114:08.13]Whatever.
[114:08.43]None of those will work.
[114:21.94]Do I actually have to have the car take me there?
[114:26.91]Smelly lady.
[114:29.15]You don't know that.
[114:29.99]Oh, there is a Sony lanyard on her neck.
[114:33.85]Now I understand why you guys are saying Sony sponsor.
[114:41.38]How was the safari?
[114:42.04]It was good.
[114:52.02]Okay, transfer those.
[114:52.96]I don't care if one of the photos is terrible.
[114:59.68]Let's get an email going.
[115:03.05]Had a herd of gazelles.
[115:04.45]I don't know if we have that many.
[115:05.79]It's only for 10,000.
[115:07.35]Who cares?
[115:08.09]Let's take a look.
[115:13.73]I like that one.
[115:15.53]That one's pretty great.
[115:17.66]This is the best one.
[115:19.74]No, it sucks.
[115:20.56]Delete.
[115:22.46]I like it.
[115:23.30]It's quaint.
[115:24.50]No, this one's good.
[115:25.94]Not good.
[115:28.98]actually kind of good.
[115:31.12]This is not a bad photo.
[115:33.16]If only that one in the... all the way far to the top right.
[115:36.66]If it was just two.
[115:37.24]No.
[115:44.25]There it is, there it is.
[115:45.05]Okay, this photo's really bad, but it's the only one that's a real hurt.
[115:54.70]It has to be this one.
[115:59.08]Whatever, I'll take the D- that I'm gonna get for this photo.
[116:06.52]It's alright, I'll take a C. Now we Ultimate Big Mouth... Didn't I already do this?
[116:16.35]Oh yeah, these are done, these are done.
[116:17.41]Okay.
[116:19.31]Uh, let's get the picture of the... Whatever it is in the tree.
[116:29.86]Clearly, this is clearly the best photo.
[116:32.11]Or this one.
[116:34.49]So let's just give him a shitty one, because I want to hold on to a couple of these.
[116:42.27]Okay, this is like a very clear, I'm staring right in the camera picture.
[116:44.85]Send it over.
[116:49.89]Marvelous.
[116:50.45]Marvelous.
[116:51.13]Marvelous.
[116:52.59]Perfect score.
[116:57.19]Uh, that's a Vervet Monkey.
[116:58.51]Adult.
[117:01.70]I need to delete some of these.
[117:02.92]Let's save a couple of them.
[117:07.34]Not this one.
[117:07.78]Get rid of that.
[117:08.62]I like this one.
[117:09.36]Get rid of this one.
[117:10.82]Get rid of this one.
[117:11.60]Keep that one.
[117:12.28]I like it.
[117:13.24]I don't... All these can go.
[117:14.56]We already got the yawn done.
[117:16.56]So I'm going to keep the one that I like.
[117:18.16]I like that one.
[117:26.10]Bad, bad, bad, bad.
[117:27.42]Nope.
[117:27.60]Keep the turkey.
[117:28.10]Delete.
[117:28.70]Delete.
[117:33.45]So again, let's try this again.
[117:34.69]X. X. X. Check.
[117:40.49]Check all.
[117:41.97]X. I can't, like, bring them over anywhere.
[117:44.41]They might just have to sit here.
[117:50.07]Unless, like, there's something I'm missing.
[117:54.98]I need to buy the storage.
[117:57.42]Really.
[118:07.73]Christmas number you can hold to 50.
[118:09.84]Carry it with your camera without feeling... No, this is for the camera.
[118:13.82]That's the camera photo still.
[118:14.98]Alright, let's go to bed.
[118:18.90]Wake up in the morning.
[118:19.56]Let's see what's on the list.
[118:23.67]I can't wait to do a tiger.
[118:28.75]Don't forget to check your email.
[118:30.43]I do every day, man.
[118:37.25]important camera repairs complete the camera you sent in for repairs before your departure just came back new camera it's a digital slr camera the a100 lens kit we've made arrangements so you can use it right away to take great photos for us of course okay this is
[119:02.64]Uh, tree monkey.
[119:04.70]Tree monkey with a black face, okay.
[119:07.06]Hello Francine, my name is David Moore.
[119:08.48]I work with the African Photo Press.
[119:09.98]We're currently looking for a shot of a vervet monkey climbing a tree.
[119:13.14]I already got one!
[119:14.97]I already do- It's done!
[119:17.83]To fill out our wildlife photo collection.
[119:19.35]If you've taken any, could you send them my way?
[119:21.15]If it's any help, vervet monkeys are often spotted where humans live.
[119:24.11]Good luck.
[119:24.41]I already got it.
[119:25.19]Done.
[119:26.27]Good thing I held onto it.
[119:29.42]That's good.
[119:29.86]That's a good photo too.
[119:32.36]Done.
[119:33.00]Take it.
[119:41.29]Thanks for the money.
[119:47.33]Cool.
[119:47.97]So now what?
[119:49.73]Go back to bed.
[119:54.11]Let me go look at my camera, though.
[119:59.06]A100.
[119:59.10]DT 18-70.
[120:00.12]F-stop is 3.55.
[120:00.70]Cool.
[120:03.70]The camera we sent to the head office to repair has come back.
[120:05.77]I put it inside the camera case.
[120:06.89]You can check it anytime.
[120:08.15]Proper focusing is key to using this camera.
[120:10.45]Now the camera is set to auto-focus.
[120:12.91]If you're not sure of a function, consult the camera photography manual on the bookshelf.
[120:21.87]So this is an autofocus camera.
[120:23.81]It's a body.
[120:24.93]Basic features intended for amateurs.
[120:26.89]Get rid of that.
[120:27.91]An easy-to-use camera utilizing super steady shot, image stabilization, and advanced autofocus.
[120:34.78]Mm-hmm.
[120:37.10]Lens.
[120:39.86]Standard zoom lens.
[120:41.06]Mimics the human eye's field of vision for a true perspective.
[120:43.06]Not intended for long-distance shots.
[120:45.74]There it is.
[120:46.20]Okay.
[120:46.74]So it's just on there already.
[120:54.43]Did I get any new tools or anything?
[120:57.71]Let's go look at the bookshelf.
[121:04.75]I want a Sony camera.
[121:06.22]Alright, we gotta look at some of this.
[121:08.74]Okay, A100.
[121:10.91]Full featured camera, but you can always use auto mode if you want to keep things simple.
[121:15.65]I never use auto on a camera.
[121:17.07]I always go to manual focus.
[121:19.01]The A100 has four noteworthy features.
[121:21.41]The lenses are interchangeable.
[121:23.21]You can introduce selective blur.
[121:25.57]You can greatly customize how you shoot.
[121:27.23]Plus, it helps stabilize camera shake.
[121:30.21]I'll introduce each one of these in a separate column.
[121:33.61]Focus.
[121:35.89]We've all seen out-of-focus photos of the subject you meant to take a picture of.
[121:38.37]Lines are blurred.
[121:39.09]You need to focus on your subject.
[121:40.87]With the A100, you can focus by half-pressing the circle button or the R1 button.
[121:45.03]That's not going to be terrible.
[121:47.35]Pressure-sensitive PlayStation 3 bullshit.
[121:49.55]Great.
[121:50.38]If you move the left stick around while doing so, you can even change the angle.
[121:55.96]A half-press.
[121:59.64]To focus.
[122:02.40]And you can move the stick around.
[122:05.25]Depth field.
[122:08.02]Mm-hmm.
[122:08.22]Depth of field determines how much of your scene, what range around the focus distance remains sharp.
[122:14.29]It's also tied to a lens's zoom.
[122:15.73]Zooming in limits the depth of field while zooming out increases it.
[122:19.10]Yes.
[122:21.01]I know that.
[122:22.27]Now we got a camera menu.
[122:23.83]Oh boy, we have an actual camera menu.
[122:26.31]Open the camera menu button by pressing the triangle.
[122:29.02]From the camera menu you can change various camera preferences in addition to trickier photography settings.
[122:34.24]You can also set preferences for continuous shooting, image confirmation after you snap a photo, shooting in black and white, and so on.
[122:41.14]So that's triangle.
[122:43.61]Different exposures.
[122:47.16]Okay, there's four modes.
[122:48.26]Auto, aperture priority, shutter speed priority, and manual exposure.
[122:52.35]In auto, snapping pictures is fully automatic.
[122:55.85]Or half auto for the other two.
[122:57.57]Half manual modes.
[122:58.51]In manual, you set everything up yourself, perfect for advanced users, though.
[123:01.25]That's what I will be using.
[123:05.62]Yep.
[123:06.72]Aperture priority.
[123:09.10]Uh-huh.
[123:10.48]Narrow depth of field for a low value.
[123:13.48]So you get to, like, really get really, really detailed motion blur moments.
[123:18.54]So we want low aperture value.
[123:27.21]Shutter speed.
[123:27.89]This is a good... This is very educational.
[123:32.49]This is... All this is good stuff.
[123:39.25]Shutter speed is how much the lens remains open 1 30th of a second a moment thousandth of a second for example Slow shutter speed you get more motion blur while faster shutter speeds will freeze your subjects in its tracks a Little motion blur can punch up your action shots though.
[123:55.81]Am I gonna be taking pictures of that?
[123:58.67]Okay We're gonna need a high shutter
[124:05.57]Yeah, this is exposure, right?
[124:08.75]How do I do it?
[124:11.33]Use plus to take brighter photos, minus mimics to take darker ones.
[124:15.17]Okay, well, how do I just, I guess, correct it?
[124:19.06]I start AF.
[124:22.56]Original features.
[124:23.20]Focuses for you automatically, even if you don't half-press the shutter.
[124:26.48]Naturally, this is very useful, since the camera will continue to focus for you as long as you have the Viewfinder open.
[124:30.24]I'm gonna just go through it.
[124:31.08]I know how to do this shit.
[124:34.18]Creative style, you can change it to like sepia, black and white, yep.
[124:39.24]Uh, with the continue- you can hold down the circle button to continuously snap photos.
[124:45.06]You can set this up in the feature settings, camera menu.
[124:50.58]You're limited to three shots in a row.
[124:52.73]You need to release the button before you can shoot again.
[124:54.45]I'm ready.
[125:01.72]Let's take a look.
[125:02.80]So I gotta go back to bed, right?
[125:03.88]Yeah, back to sleep.
[125:04.58]I already handed in the, uh, the verbic monkey one.
[125:16.95]New emails?
[125:17.47]No.
[125:18.87]What's the thing I haven't done?
[125:21.09]I have to get a photo of this zebra.
[125:25.31]Close up in the face.
[125:26.17]Alright, let's go.
[125:40.00]Is this fun?
[125:41.62]Yeah.
[125:45.33]This is a good game, I'm having fun.
[125:48.57]It's fun to take pictures of animals.
[125:55.32]And now we have a camera that I can actually toggle different settings.
[126:06.89]And we're only the first area.
[126:08.45]There's a whole other area up there with like lions and tigers and shit.
[126:15.88]Let's take a look at the camera.
[126:17.74]Here we go.
[126:19.36]Here's our new camera.
[126:20.20]Let's go into the settings here.
[126:25.01]Exposure mode.
[126:27.29]Aperture priority.
[126:28.11]Let's do manual.
[126:29.69]Shutter speed.
[126:30.31]Let's get like a high shutter.
[126:36.12]I really wish I could see the auto-review on, creative style.
[126:43.36]I wish I could see what it looks like without needing to.
[127:05.70]Charge bit's too long.
[127:06.62]Well, I'm trying to... You'll see.
[127:11.81]I need a Zebra.
[127:39.13]Alright, can you stop?
[127:56.88]Let's go.
[128:02.12]Wait, what?
[128:02.42]There's a cheetah?
[128:08.11]Let me out of the car!
[128:09.17]Let me out!
[128:16.30]Oh god, he's gonna be... I gotta get him, like, stalking.
[128:35.86]I'm getting some pretty good shots already here.
[128:39.84]I shouldn't even need to bring the camera out.
[128:51.70]He's gonna be running fast.
[128:58.14]Hurry, gazelles.
[128:59.26]It's this time to pray God away.
[129:01.08]We know that the cheetahs live on the du- Yeah, well, what the hell?
[129:03.73]Why wouldn't you let me get ahead of the car?
[129:05.03]Are you ready to go?
[129:07.53]What?
[129:09.23]Hold on.
[129:12.88]Why wouldn't you let me get out of the car before?
[129:14.29]Alright, is there a zebra around here?
[129:20.23]Alright, there's no... I do not see a zebra.
[129:25.69]Look, a cheetah!
[129:27.43]Stay in the fucking car!
[129:29.51]Yeah, let.
[129:40.98]Why do you keep stopping me?
[129:43.30]Is that a zebra?
[130:04.35]Over there?
[130:05.49]There it is.
[130:05.87]Okay, can you... I'm going to be too far away from him, though.
[130:14.88]You do know we're on the mission to take a picture of a zebra, right?
[130:17.02]Where are my binoculars?
[130:39.29]Where the fuck are the zebras?
[130:41.73]We just drove in a circle.
[130:42.67]I didn't see one zebra.
[130:48.52]He just wanted to show me the cheetah and then take me home.
[130:55.22]I'm definitely gonna get an email about cheetahs.
[131:06.53]Alright, we're home.
[131:08.25]That was fun
[131:10.19]That was good to see.
[131:11.07]I'm glad we got to see the cheetah.
[131:13.49]Email me about it tomorrow.
[131:19.47]Hold on a minute.
[131:19.93]Let me just do something.
[131:27.74]Alright, let's get... Let's make some fucked up shit happen here.
[131:50.33]Oh look, I get a picture of that!
[131:56.29]That's so funny.
[131:57.13]That's such a ridiculous shot.
[132:01.98]Alright, let me go get the email about the fucking cheetah.
[132:16.59]That was great today, but I didn't do anything.
[132:19.19]You drove around in a circle.
[132:25.43]You encountered Cheetah?
[132:26.47]Well, I'll write off the report.
[132:27.90]Go to bed.
[132:28.32]Nah, I don't want to transfer these photos.
[132:35.98]I'm just making a joke.
[132:42.01]He's like trying to get in the photo.
[132:45.39]You know, the aperture is bad, but it makes it kind of good.
[132:50.41]If only the shutter wasn't so stupid.
[132:52.48]And I didn't have, like, a photo bomb here.
[132:54.24]I think I'm going to have to keep this one.
[132:59.90]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[133:07.79]Okay, let's go to bed.
[133:08.97]I'm going to take a picture of a cheetah stalking prey tomorrow or something, right?
[133:19.57]Got a new email.
[133:22.75]It's gonna be about a cheetah.
[133:23.93]Just you wait.
[133:26.13]Hunting at 60 miles per hour.
[133:27.99]Mm-hmm.
[133:30.51]This is Peter O'Brien over at National Geographic.
[133:32.89]Next month's feature is about hunters of the Savannah.
[133:36.24]And we want to talk about how cheetahs hunt.
[133:38.08]We'd like you to handle the photography.
[133:40.48]The cheetah tears after its prey at 60 miles an hour.
[133:43.88]You only get one moment to take the shot.
[133:45.96]It's an important job, but I know you're up to it.
[133:49.47]This is apparently one of the harder difficulty ones.
[133:51.37]I only get one chance.
[133:59.43]I didn't get a picture of a cheetah.
[134:08.23]Okay, so I'm gonna save it here because I should.
[134:12.85]And I'm also gonna go to the bathroom.
[134:15.00]So I'm gonna say, it's gonna take, by the time this is done, I'll be back.
[134:18.85]So let me just take a piss break, I'll be right back.
[134:21.16]See you guys in a second.
[136:55.62]Alright.
[136:56.10]And we saved.
[136:57.19]Good.
[136:57.45]Alright.
[136:59.07]Alright.
[137:17.23]We've been asked to photograph a cheetah.
[137:19.01]Could you try to find that cheetah again?
[137:20.70]This one's up to you.
[137:22.72]Hope you can get that perfect picture.
[137:25.80]Did I accept the mission?
[137:27.20]Make sure I just accepted it.
[137:28.10]Yeah.
[137:36.07]So do I need to take a photo of it killing something or take a photo of it when it's about to kill something?
[137:46.89]I'm gonna have to drop the shutter, too.
[137:49.05]And do a burst photo.
[137:53.46]60 miles per hour, I got one second.
[138:00.80]A photo about to kill you.
[138:08.92]Take a selfie while being eaten at 60 miles per... Fresh beer.
[138:19.09]I'm gonna say that every fucking time.
[138:21.83]Looking for a cheetah.
[138:23.29]Let's try the ant hill.
[138:24.53]There was a cheetah in that area before.
[138:26.11]Alright, let's get in here.
[138:40.32]Continue shooting on... ...standard.
[138:44.41]Let me just get, let me see what I'm doing here.
[139:00.51]Let me see those photos.
[139:01.23]I'm going too fast.
[139:10.17]Can I drop it?
[139:13.71]Can I drop that?
[139:21.53]I couldn't go up to these values before.
[139:24.83]I could not pick these before.
[139:35.54]Oh, they're dark.
[139:36.08]I gotta bring the, uh... Hold on.
[139:43.40]Gives it one one-thousandth.
[139:45.04]And then we gotta open up the fucking eye a little bit here.
[139:47.26]Is that gonna help?
[139:52.36]No.
[139:52.68]Fuck, we need exposure composition.
[139:54.48]We need exposure... Exposure!
[139:58.29]Plus one!
[140:06.50]Fuck.
[140:09.84]The shutter's too high.
[140:27.22]It's too high.
[140:30.50]Let's try this.
[140:33.24]It's not terrible.
[140:42.43]Let's try that.
[140:44.23]1, let's see, 320.
[140:45.67]1, 320.
[140:45.81]Alright.
[140:49.45]That looks okay.
[140:50.43]That looks okay.
[140:55.26]Alright, that doesn't look bad.
[140:56.42]I think we're good.
[140:58.44]Adjust the aperture.
[140:59.76]Goddamn, I gotta do full manual here.
[141:01.16]That's as much as I can go.
[141:07.86]I can't do exposure.
[141:08.88]No, I gotta keep doing it on shutter speed priority.
[141:11.96]Three and a half is as far as I can get it.
[141:13.40]That didn't look terrible.
[141:16.98]Okay.
[141:23.98]Nobody home at the anthill.
[141:30.73]Let's try the oasis.
[141:36.15]Oh, fuck!
[141:36.67]I have two more!
[141:37.43]I gotta get rid of these!
[141:38.55]How do I delete these?
[141:39.91]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[141:44.31]The aperture cannot go lower than 3.5 on this camera.
[141:49.25]Okay.
[142:00.78]Looking over there.
[142:09.90]I'm shooting auto-review.
[142:11.87]Uh, no.
[142:15.32]Some of those look cool.
[142:16.22]Let me make sure this... Yeah.
[142:26.53]No, that's going to be fine.
[142:27.25]It's not going to be blurry.
[142:34.95]Looking for the cheetah.
[142:40.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[142:41.32]Stop the car!
[142:41.88]Stop the car!
[142:42.58]Stop the car!
[142:43.90]Stop!
[142:44.64]Stop the car!
[142:45.60]Why can I not tell you to stop the car?
[142:48.76]Get me off the rails.
[142:50.92]Why?
[142:51.20]I wanna stop.
[142:52.43]It's an opportunity to get a picture of a zebra.
[142:59.77]Fuck, I'm gonna get one opportunity and I'm gonna blow this.
[143:05.03]I got three shots continuously in a row.
[143:07.71]As long as I can get a decent one, I'll be fine.
[143:10.36]No sign of the cheetah.
[143:14.02]You try to spot a cheetah using the binoculars.
[143:20.79]Okay.
[143:23.45]I'm just gonna drive through the animals.
[143:33.58]I don't see a cheetah.
[143:34.50]I don't even need to use the binoculars.
[143:43.59]This is Star Wars music.
[143:45.69]You're right, it is Star Wars music.
[143:54.74]This is specifically like Obi-Wan.
[143:58.85]The crescendo of this is every time Obi-Wan does a gigantic force front flip or back flip onto another ledge.
[144:06.53]I'll give you an example here.
[144:08.28]Here he goes.
[144:08.72]He swings the lightsaber.
[144:12.92]There's the backflip.
[144:13.90]Up maybe two levels above the enemy.
[144:16.86]And he stays there and looks down and turns his lightsaber off.
[144:20.84]And then turns around and he goes down another direction.
[144:22.90]So it's always a backflip or a frontflip.
[144:24.26]I was going to look for a fucking cheetah.
[144:45.97]this cheetah cheetah oh aren't those what that's a cheetah right there isn't that cheetah and not a cheetah cheetah oh look there oh you're just saying the things that I point the camera at found it cheetah cheetah cheetah there it is
[145:16.45]Okay, I gotta get ready.
[145:17.03]Alright, set it up.
[145:19.97]I got one chance.
[145:23.19]Can I bring this into Photoshop later and fuck with it or no?
[145:28.73]It's looking up a prey on top of the anthill.
[145:32.25]It might start a chase, so let's get closer.
[145:34.85]Goddamn.
[145:39.15]It has eyes- It's eyes on a Thompson's gazelle.
[145:44.31]Is your camera ready?
[145:44.97]Make sure you have enough photos left.
[145:48.64]I'll follow alongside when the cheetah starts running.
[145:50.46]Get that perfect shot.
[145:59.74]Big game number one.
[146:00.70]Snap a cheetah hunting.
[146:02.06]Is the camera gonna already be open?
[146:03.46]I only have like three seconds to get this correct.
[146:13.11]What?
[146:13.33]No, this is not the cutscene anymore.
[146:14.51]Where is he?
[146:15.87]Where's the cheetah?
[146:22.33]What are you doing?
[146:41.75]Oh, look at that one.
[146:57.78]You really have to do that?
[146:59.74]You see it three times?
[147:08.58]That is not the best one.
[147:10.58]That's not the best one.
[147:13.54]Looks like they're doing a conga line.
[147:15.94]This one sucks.
[147:21.84]That was one fantastic hunt.
[147:26.35]You must have gotten some great photos.
[147:33.44]There's no blood.
[147:36.70]No, this game was to educate children how to use cameras, specifically from Sony.
[147:53.72]Got it.
[147:54.52]Ready to go home.
[147:56.18]Now, if you see a zebra, stop the car.
[148:02.92]Because I can get that too.
[148:04.80]Where are all the explosions?
[148:12.17]I know, this guy's bullshit.
[148:16.61]Where are the fucking TIE Fighters?
[148:23.34]Zebras?
[148:24.98]No.
[148:26.08]I'm never gonna get that close with a zebra's face.
[148:31.15]Put on different music than this.
[148:33.91]I can't put on custom music.
[148:36.57]No!
[148:40.17]We have to deal with the same Star Wars track over and over again.
[148:44.25]You're just watching your favorite scene.
[148:46.63]You're watching the General Grievous scene over and over again.
[148:52.65]In fact, I think he does it in the General Grievous scene.
[148:57.75]No, it actually happens in that scene.
[148:59.21]Let's see.
[149:16.01]It's not going to be a copyright problem.
[149:17.89]Don't worry.
[149:18.19]I just need to get to the one part that I think is going to happen.
[149:22.47]Let's get it on screen.
[149:33.33]And here it comes.
[149:39.90]Where is it?
[149:41.16]Come on.
[149:53.30]He jumps down.
[149:54.82]Does he jump up?
[149:57.41]Why is this like big backflip that he does up?
[150:00.47]I know what happens.
[150:11.18]Here, look.
[150:11.92]I'll show you.
[150:12.28]If you've never seen Star Wars before, then just fucking... Whatever.
[150:24.54]You fool!
[150:26.52]I've been trained in your Jedi acts by Count Dooku!
[150:32.26]No, no, I can't play this!
[150:33.70]I gotta stop this now!
[150:34.88]Stop!
[150:35.10]No, no, no, that was less than 10 seconds.
[150:36.54]Okay, hold on.
[150:41.78]Where's the jump?
[150:52.29]Update your mi- Okay.
[150:55.42]Here it comes!
[150:57.34]Here we go, here we go, here we go!
[151:28.39]There it is.
[151:43.80]I'm not gonna get in trouble.
[151:44.68]That was like five seconds.
[151:51.24]I sort of fucking sneeze of the movie.
[151:59.62]We were looking for when he jumps backwards or forwards and he jumps forwards.
[152:03.90]I'm not gonna get in trouble.
[152:06.98]I showed fucking four seconds of a movie.
[152:10.76]That came out like 40 years ago.
[152:13.16]20 years ago.
[152:19.09]There are people that like stream all the Harry fucking Potter movies on Twitch.
[152:27.05]I don't think we have to be concerned about, like, eight seconds.
[152:34.97]You can find, like, whole fucking movie streams.
[152:37.93]Like, super illegal movie streams.
[152:40.99]Watching, like, all the Lord of the Rings.
[152:42.39]Alright.
[152:47.49]Let's see what we got.
[152:49.69]Your best shot.
[152:50.55]Really?
[152:57.15]This is the one.
[152:57.97]Let's reply.
[153:02.73]Which one?
[153:05.45]How is that not a good shot?
[153:07.71]This is great.
[153:08.17]This is like showing the kill.
[153:09.13]This is when he fell over.
[153:19.03]That one's good.
[153:33.05]Apparently they think it's this one.
[153:35.47]The first one, I guess, is the better one.
[153:42.01]He was then later banned from Twitch for those four seconds of copyright material.
[153:49.79]We're gonna use this one.
[153:50.63]This is the one that the video game has determined is the best one, so I'm gonna use it.
[154:02.15]That's pretty good.
[154:10.38]Yeah, we got the algorithm in our favor.
[154:12.08]I still need to do this one.
[154:14.54]I got a lot of money.
[154:15.38]I should buy something.
[154:19.79]I'm just hoarding all of my cash right now.
[154:22.59]For no reason.
[154:31.65]Unless eventually I can buy something better.
[154:35.58]But what does this frame do?
[154:42.15]Put the... Save for a 10-foot lens.
[154:44.83]I mean, we could.
[154:47.53]What did the client think about the photo you sent them, Francie?
[154:49.77]Well, we've crossed a milestone in our survey.
[154:51.59]We should get some rest.
[154:56.23]Put the turkey photo in the photo frame and then put it on the wall.
[154:58.57]Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[155:05.52]Hold on.
[155:12.77]I'm buying it.
[155:16.95]I hung up the photo frame in the back.
[155:20.87]Perfect!
[155:45.91]Let's see what the new task is.
[155:51.12]Sending map of new research area.
[155:55.62]We've obtained a detailed map of the wetlands adjacent to the Duma Steppe.
[155:59.18]In the area, they refer to them as the Kiboko Swamp.
[156:03.30]The rich water supply draws a number of animal inhabitants, especially those who thrive alone at the water's edge.
[156:09.19]Please focus your efforts in this new area starting today.
[156:19.34]I'm getting I'm like 60.
[156:23.04]I used to never have to have this problem When you get like a little older it should just happens man, I can't that I just I'm old I'm getting older I
[156:36.02]You've been listening to the noises your fucking grandfather makes when he's just sitting there?
[156:41.48]He's got like his hands together and he's just got his thumbs down and he's just like sitting there just relaxing and all of a sudden he just goes like I know what that's like.
[156:50.71]I get it now.
[156:57.39]Sometimes it'll just be like I understand.
[157:08.41]Okay, so we're going to do research area.
[157:11.60]Please focus your efforts on this new area starting today.
[157:15.92]Wait, actually, I can send an email to Cheetah.
[157:21.83]Any new animal, just $3,000.
[157:23.25]Let's get a good one here of the Cheetah.
[157:30.59]No, no.
[157:32.90]What the hell is that?
[157:42.24]That's good.
[157:43.10]That's a good photo, but it's not of a cheetah.
[157:49.08]Unfortunately, I have to use one of the ones... One of these ones here.
[157:54.86]Like this one.
[157:56.61]Oh, this one's probably good.
[157:57.75]Or that one.
[157:59.19]I'll do this one.
[158:01.89]Framing's pretty terrible, but whatever.
[158:03.19]I'm gonna get the money anyway.
[158:11.26]Nevermind.
[158:11.88]Alright.
[158:15.73]It's time to explore the wetlands.
[158:18.73]I can join you in the field starting today.
[158:20.55]It took you like five days.
[158:21.87]Let's head to the swamp.
[158:29.36]Zoomer streamer pukes on keyboard.
[158:33.30]I'm not a zoomer.
[158:36.50]I'm not a boomer either.
[158:45.27]I am a millennial.
[158:52.54]He's a Zoombini.
[159:03.12]I'll drive us to the Kikogo- Kikibo- Kiboko Swamp, Francine.
[159:08.89]You just take the backseat and enjoy the sights.
[159:14.44]Where's James?
[159:24.21]You drive like shit.
[159:25.57]Can I please bring James back?
[159:26.81]Alright, we gotta go back in to change some shit here.
[159:31.07]Let's put it on auto for now.
[159:45.62]Enjoy the sight.
[159:46.30]I wonder if I get maybe some cool shots here.
[159:51.57]Actually... Let's put the shutter speed down.
[160:04.17]Just in case something crazy happens.
[160:05.41]Just getting something cool.
[160:10.63]Is this that Vive game he was talking about?
[160:12.34]No, the reason why I didn't do Vive today is because...
[160:15.74]I did not know if I was even going to be able to stream.
[160:18.84]I didn't want to have a scenario where I turn the stream on and the internet's still fucked up and I'm like all set up in a 5 VR room and the stream goes down in like 45 minutes.
[160:30.23]So I figured I would do this today.
[160:34.74]and then do the Vive hopefully tomorrow if his internet still works.
[160:39.73]I don't know.
[160:40.19]It's going to be tough because it seems that we're having other issues too with how our bandwidth is being split between because Etalyx is here as well.
[160:51.09]So it's almost like when we have two computers running at the same time.
[160:53.43]One just can kill the other now.
[160:55.23]I don't know why.
[160:58.55]So I don't know.
[160:58.99]We might have to do a situation where we straightly try to take turns using the broken internet.
[161:10.45]We'll have to figure that out.
[161:12.11]Hopefully it just works.
[161:13.37]Because it seems to be working now, but... He, like... I thought there was a Twitch logo.
[161:18.78]Uh... I think he tried to, like, do something, like, on the internet.
[161:22.44]And that's when we dropped, like, a thousand, two thousand frames.
[161:26.88]Weird.
[161:27.12]I don't know.
[161:27.68]I can't... I can't explain it.
[161:28.86]The map from the head office indicates that the Kiboko Swamp lies this way.
[161:32.63]Let's go.
[161:32.89]Let's go.
[161:46.18]And it's definitely not a problem with any of our equipment, because we've had this... We've had the same shit for four months.
[161:53.85]And we hadn't really had a problem that we had to deal with this before.
[161:57.93]All this shit started three days ago, when the whole internet just cut off, turned off.
[162:02.85]To zero.
[162:05.31]And then I was told by people at Cox that we have like a packet loss problem.
[162:11.07]And they were going to fix it.
[162:11.77]And they were going to work on it.
[162:13.15]And I don't know.
[162:13.55]Maybe they're still doing that.
[162:14.54]Maybe they're still... We're getting like some fallout from the weather maybe.
[162:18.46]I don't know.
[162:19.14]We're just going to try.
[162:20.30]We're going to do what we can do.
[162:21.30]That's all we can do.
[162:25.08]Alright.
[162:25.30]What an incredible sight we're at this moment.
[162:34.07]Wait.
[162:34.19]Wait.
[162:41.50]Ooh!
[162:43.00]That's a nice photo.
[162:43.76]That's a nice look.
[162:45.46]That photo was terrible, but that was a nice looking photo.
[162:57.40]Nah, leave it, leave it, leave it with me.
[163:00.94]Any other animals in the swamp?
[163:08.55]Eric follows the GPS into a lake.
[163:13.63]That climbing shrub is called a water tree.
[163:18.31]That tree looks like an easy one to climb.
[163:20.11]We're going to climb the tree.
[163:22.19]Climb a tree to conceal yourself from the animals.
[163:29.01]Am I going to get equipment to go up here?
[163:32.89]He's pointing it out and he's going to drive by it.
[163:41.85]See, Francine, this right here is a lake.
[163:44.09]It's a swamp.
[163:44.73]The swamp is much larger than I expected.
[163:48.69]Why don't you take the wheel from here?
[163:50.79]Why don't I take the wheel from here?
[163:53.64]What?
[163:55.58]I have to drive the car now.
[163:57.12]How do I drive it?
[164:05.79]Just went up the whole letter grade.
[164:09.31]So, what do you want me to do?
[164:13.06]Can I dump him?
[164:13.86]I wonder if I can, like, dump this guy.
[164:26.02]What do you want me to do?
[164:27.66]Take the wheel to do what?
[164:29.98]I can't take any pictures.
[164:38.76]Look, I could have gotten those swans.
[164:44.29]Do I climb the tree?
[164:54.09]Eric.
[164:54.87]Oh, what the hell?
[165:03.07]This looks like a battery-powered toy car.
[165:06.17]Yeah, it does look like a Power Wheels.
[165:10.92]What the fuck am I looking for?
[165:21.38]I'm just upping a tree.
[165:42.33]What are we doing this for?
[165:45.47]Hold on.
[165:45.99]Wait, wait, wait.
[165:46.59]Here we go.
[165:51.04]Fly right down into me.
[165:53.68]Fly down, down, down, down, down, right into me.
[165:59.18]Come on, down.
[166:05.35]Okay.
[166:07.41]Not terrible.
[166:07.99]A lot of birds.
[166:10.99]This one coming straight on.
[166:37.44]These photos are not very good.
[166:40.18]Ooh, ooh, ooh!
[166:54.62]Okay.
[166:56.40]Let me take a look at that one.
[167:05.18]That might be the best photo I've taken, and it was a snap.
[167:07.94]Look at the background.
[167:09.96]Look at his wings are a little bit out of focus, what his beak is.
[167:14.02]That was a great photo.
[167:19.67]Okay, what about other birds, maybe?
[167:26.87]Maybe I should move.
[167:27.52]Because I think there's more than one.
[167:30.46]There's those ones.
[167:36.69]Take a selfie.
[167:38.57]Selfies didn't exist.
[167:42.45]This game came out in like 2008.
[167:44.96]Selfies were not a thing that made any sense.
[167:55.85]Selfies?
[167:56.13]No they didn't.
[167:56.63]Selfies did not exist.
[168:00.11]There was no picture camera that you could hold in your hand and turn that way.
[168:03.53]I can get closer than that.
[168:20.64]Just T-Posed.
[168:21.82]It happened.
[168:36.47]Alright, right here, right here.
[168:37.33]Slow down, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[168:40.75]I need closer than that.
[169:26.44]Get back in camera mode.
[169:38.34]Y'all.
[169:40.22]Right there, that's the one.
[169:41.56]Take it.
[169:43.54]Oh, fuck.
[169:45.59]Had it.
[169:45.93]It was close.
[169:59.24]Right there.
[169:59.59]Stay right there.
[170:30.89]What?
[170:31.24]What?
[170:31.74]What?
[170:33.88]Eric!
[170:34.86]Eric!
[170:35.54]Eric!
[170:35.92]Eric!
[170:36.32]Eric!
[170:37.04]Eric!
[170:37.82]Where's Eric?
[170:40.05]Where's the car?
[170:42.55]Eric, get the engine going!
[170:43.57]No!
[171:05.80]Do I get to keep my photos?
[171:13.71]God damn it, no!
[171:15.27]Ugh...
[171:28.82]That picture of the bird is gone.
[171:33.78]The picture of the bird.
[171:34.82]That was the best picture ever taken.
[171:36.52]Hey, a camping tent.
[171:43.38]Spend the night in the field and get an early start the next morning.
[171:45.71]An outdoorsman's best friend.
[171:55.34]That sucks.
[171:57.66]That actually sucks.
[171:58.84]I'm gonna buy it.
[171:59.95]Let's get the tent.
[172:26.04]Why does the buffalo wipe the camera?
[172:29.61]I don't know.
[172:30.07]I'm so disappointed right now.
[172:41.31]Why would Eric save the photographer and not the photos?
[172:47.41]Because at the end of the day, I matter, not the footage.
[173:01.60]Buffalo took the SD card.
[173:04.45]No, I think it's what's implied.
[173:05.61]Because your camera gets stomped.
[173:12.22]Those are some good photos too.
[173:31.99]What?
[173:32.47]Why?
[173:33.91]We gotta go back to the wetlands.
[173:35.15]I need to go explore and take some good photos.
[173:38.88]Go get revenge.
[173:40.38]What?
[173:40.60]Go run over the buffalo.
[173:45.40]Go get the car- I gotta go get my SD card back.
[173:50.34]We can't flip the car, right?
[173:56.42]Where is this heading?
[173:56.92]Is this a different zone, too?
[174:05.32]Heading towards, uh, yeah, this one.
[174:24.05]I gotta get my souls back.
[174:30.07]I'm glad I actually hit the drive, though.
[174:31.68]Because that was annoying.
[174:34.93]Having to wait for some guy to drive you around.
[174:53.94]At what point does Eric start to say, uh, can you... Watch out!
[174:58.65]Hey now, watch your driving!
[175:01.04]There it is.
[175:01.42]There it is.
[175:03.64]He's like, please, don't do that.
[175:05.12]I just did a Jay Leno, by the way.
[175:08.32]There it is.
[175:10.35]There it is.
[175:12.07]I might as well be shaking my head around.
[175:19.79]Alright, let's do this again.
[175:20.77]Let's find a place to stop.
[175:27.85]I can't believe I lost the picture of the gull, or the pelican, or the swan, or the flamingo, or the... I don't know, one of the birds have the weird long sock necks.
[175:40.56]Here we go.
[175:47.43]Get out of the car.
[175:59.20]Let's get a good one from far away.
[176:00.54]That's not bad.
[176:01.78]Oh, I gotta hold on.
[176:06.80]Aperture's waiting.
[176:07.38]Hold on.
[176:07.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[176:08.24]No, no, no.
[176:10.79]I need to... I gotta get closer, otherwise I have to drop the aperture!
[176:14.35]That's better.
[176:22.65]Ah, there's one drinking right there.
[176:25.46]Ah, I gotta get closer.
[176:34.37]Do not get fucking killed again over this.
[176:42.17]Not bad.
[176:42.63]Alright, I got the fucking photo I need.
[176:46.95]No, what are you doing?
[177:03.32]Let's do dark.
[177:06.19]He's going manual!
[177:07.41]It's too dark.
[177:09.19]I'm not sticking around, I got what I needed.
[177:14.57]Oh my god, why?
[177:21.63]Now I gotta get a couple photos of... Can I take a photo right now if the car has stopped?
[177:27.90]Or do I have to get out of the car?
[177:31.02]This guy's not gonna knock the Jeep over, is he?
[177:34.32]No.
[177:35.87]Alright, what about over here?
[177:36.87]This goes back... I need to get some... I need to get the birds.
[177:41.23]Can I climb a tree?
[177:46.36]Climbing the tree had a good shot.
[177:52.13]I'm so pissed off that I lost those.
[178:01.14]Hey, is this the streamer that photographed a wild buffalo on manual?
[178:05.77]Not yet.
[178:18.98]He has a driver's ed brake.
[178:21.62]I think that's what's going on.
[178:29.48]Right, see, the head office hasn't sent us maps for this area yet.
[178:32.22]Oh, okay, fine.
[178:33.60]So I need, I got the buffalo, I need the flying birds.
[178:41.63]Can I climb these trees?
[178:47.71]Get in this one.
[178:48.27]Gonna take the fucking pictures all over again.
[178:51.63]Let's get this back up.
[178:58.47]Uh, Shutter Spree's priority... Alright, okay.
[179:07.21]The birds are gonna be flying around, I need some good speed.
[179:10.47]Climb tree.
[179:17.28]Can I only climb certain trees?
[179:19.00]Is that what I'm missing here?
[179:19.88]I can't climb this?
[179:29.51]I guess I can.
[179:34.32]Why the hell not?
[179:34.94]Alright, well, whatever.
[179:47.66]What tree should I go to, then?
[179:52.52]What happened to the Jeep?
[179:53.51]I was gonna say, what?
[179:55.75]How did it camouflage?
[180:01.89]Alright, we'll try the other tree.
[180:10.33]Go, buddy.
[180:11.47]This one down here.
[180:12.93]One of the big ones, probably.
[180:16.13]Alright, there's a new animal here.
[180:25.11]Well, no, we've seen these, but... I think they're different gazelles?
[180:30.28]I'm going to get up in that tree right there.
[180:31.58]That's a good spot.
[180:34.18]The Baobab trees.
[180:37.82]Something to be climbing around in the trees, right?
[180:54.43]Did I not... Can I not climb the tree unless he tells me to climb the tree?
[180:58.09]Is there one tree I can get on?
[181:02.98]I don't think I can get on any tree but the one in the middle.
[181:05.34]What about this one?
[181:13.22]I don't see prompts or anything.
[181:14.34]Oh, come on.
[181:24.97]Nice FPS, bro!
[181:28.17]Yeah, whatever.
[181:33.54]Alright, these are deer.
[181:37.72]There is a hole in that one.
[181:38.58]Yeah, I know.
[181:48.51]Somebody turn.
[181:48.95]Alright, well, whatever.
[181:56.74]Just get out of my way.
[181:57.78]I'm going in the tree.
[182:06.41]Go in the tree!
[182:11.24]Why am I doing this?
[182:17.08]Do I live here now?
[182:22.45]Am I baiting somebody out?
[182:26.21]I'm hiding here.
[182:27.95]But what am I hiding from?
[182:36.59]Oh, that was fun.
[182:40.35]Ooh, this one has horns.
[182:45.61]Gotta get closer.
[182:46.91]Shh.
[182:56.82]No, just in case you run away, let me get one.
[183:45.93]I'm just, I'm just like bored in this menu.
[183:55.47]Ooh!
[183:55.66]Some of those were good.
[184:07.44]So now I just need the bird and we can get out of here.
[184:16.34]Go get in the tree.
[184:22.47]That's why we shoot raw.
[184:29.22]I really wish I had a picture of one of the gulls, but I don't.
[184:31.44]Get Ted back.
[184:46.42]I can probably get a shitty picture of one of these, uh, birds.
[184:51.74]Yeah, I get it, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[184:53.50]You don't have to hold down the fucking instructor brake.
[184:59.56]Just get like a zoom in of one of- I'll get one of these birds, hold on.
[185:02.12]Even though it looks like shit, I don't even care.
[185:07.18]I just have to get them collected.
[185:20.59]Whatever.
[185:20.89]I want to do another one of those cheetah missions.
[185:30.08]That was really cool.
[185:36.44]The cheetah mission had... They only give you a certain amount of time.
[185:40.18]What happened to the Star Wars music?
[185:44.64]I haven't... That's true.
[185:46.31]It kind of just disappeared.
[185:53.76]Why did the music disappear?
[186:00.20]I couldn't tell you.
[186:00.88]I have no idea.
[186:04.96]That was music for James.
[186:16.60]It took a long time to load that.
[186:18.06]The area is secured.
[186:22.70]We got this one.
[186:24.70]I honestly don't even know where the camp is.
[186:32.44]Oh, there it is.
[186:54.03]And you don't get stuck like this.
[186:55.51]I don't even know where the save point was.
[187:02.19]Get up there!
[187:02.75]This is really an electrical powered 4x4.
[187:11.85]Get out of the car!
[187:29.06]Hey, thanks!
[187:29.96]Whoa, somehow we pulled free!
[187:32.16]Wow!
[187:34.74]Thank you, World of Warcraft Game Master.
[187:38.91]Appreciate that.
[187:40.63]Now I got stuck in Ironforge again.
[187:43.51]How do I go back to camp?
[187:44.93]It's starting to get dark.
[187:52.02]Can I... Can we get out of the car?
[187:55.52]End... Okay, here we go.
[187:56.60]End Safari.
[187:59.69]Oh my god, you could just teleport.
[188:08.21]Let's get a mission.
[188:16.08]This is so bad.
[188:22.48]Uh, which one's worse?
[188:28.91]That's pretty good.
[188:30.83]That's not so good.
[188:31.91]Neither is that.
[188:32.69]This one is good.
[188:33.83]That one's really good.
[188:34.57]I'm going to say this is the one I'm going to send.
[188:44.28]I'm not looking for good scores.
[188:45.24]I just want them to have the database so I get the mission to do it.
[188:51.48]There's a Pelican.
[188:52.54]I got it right.
[189:06.33]That one's good.
[189:14.20]Three grand.
[189:15.24]I'll take it.
[189:18.20]That's an Impala.
[189:19.21]What else we got?
[189:24.49]The Buffaloes, right?
[189:26.67]Oh, these are different.
[189:27.41]No, this is the... Uh... Male and female, right?
[189:35.72]Oh, this is different.
[189:36.72]Bad angle?
[189:37.47]How is this a bad angle?
[189:44.63]Alright, we got the buffalos.
[189:54.48]The one that's the most in focus is the one over there.
[189:57.43]To the left.
[190:03.42]You can take this one.
[190:15.03]African buffalo.
[190:18.21]Are there any others?
[190:19.67]I don't think so.
[190:20.45]I got the gull.
[190:22.25]I got the... I'm gonna hold on to these, though.
[190:24.43]This one, in particular.
[190:25.49]Get rid of the shitty ones.
[190:29.81]Get rid of all the shitty buffalo ones.
[190:31.41]What is this?
[190:31.85]Oh.
[190:33.41]A bush.
[190:33.95]Just get rid of this one too.
[190:37.69]Hold on to these ones because I like them.
[190:39.48]Got to keep that one.
[190:41.60]And that looks good.
[190:49.12]Alright.
[190:50.50]Go to bed.
[190:51.63]See if I actually have a mission tomorrow.
[191:00.07]Check the email.
[191:03.99]Here we go.
[191:04.35]Whoa, that's a lot.
[191:07.62]Photo for nature power.
[191:10.18]Could you get a giraffe at eye level?
[191:14.44]What?
[191:16.92]How are you tree climbing skills?
[191:18.24]I've got a job for you.
[191:18.86]I need a close-up of a giraffe's face, but not just any close-up.
[191:21.96]I kind of promised my boss I'd get him a shot taken from tree level.
[191:26.51]Can you bail me out?
[191:30.26]If I can climb a tree, maybe.
[191:32.96]Hello Francine, my name is Javi Salgado, and I represent NINP Publishing.
[191:38.76]It's a pleasure to meet you.
[191:39.92]We plan to introduce readers to the African buffalo in one of our upcoming magazines.
[191:42.64]Do you think you could provide a photo?
[191:44.65]Try and get as close to a vicious buffalo as you can.
[191:48.31]We want a tense shot.
[191:53.13]You saw what happened last time.
[191:57.69]Are you familiar with an animal called the impala?
[192:00.89]Each male is what you might call a player.
[192:02.89]He forms a harem of multiple females.
[192:08.30]Uh, okay.
[192:10.40]Photograph one of these harems.
[192:12.70]Look for the male's magnificent horns, and please make sure both male and female are in frame.
[192:18.56]What's this for?
[192:19.08]Am I just gonna send this to this guy?
[192:24.84]Hey, can you show this?
[192:25.62]That's for me.
[192:26.18]It doesn't say what it's for.
[192:34.30]Yeah, there's no official reason for these photos.
[192:39.30]Okay.
[192:39.62]Well, whatever.
[192:40.04]Alright, what's... A giraffe at eye level is more interesting.
[192:44.12]I'm gonna take this one first.
[192:48.92]And then we're looking for what we can get that.
[192:51.14]We still need a close-up of a zebra's face.
[192:54.59]Don't think we're gonna get that, though.
[192:55.55]Let me get this.
[193:00.29]Find a tree we can climb.
[193:17.92]Well, interestingly enough, I think the internet has been incredibly stable.
[193:25.50]So cross your fingers that today's test stream can carry us into tomorrow and the next day, hopefully.
[193:42.09]I wasn't even going to stream today.
[193:43.27]I was going to just not do it.
[193:44.81]But it looks like we might be good to go.
[193:54.18]He just drove in front of my car.
[193:55.38]What?
[193:59.37]Oh my god, why are you doing this to me?
[194:11.72]You thought this was going to be a transition into 5?
[194:14.24]Well, I can't really do that right now.
[194:17.70]Because I have to set the room up again.
[194:19.42]I had to bring all my shit back in here to sit down at my desk.
[194:23.68]That's not going to happen tonight.
[194:28.97]Tonight was really just to make sure that the stream could be on for more than 2 or 3 hours.
[194:32.43]Like, I've got to set up my lighthouses back here again.
[194:46.57]Yeah, Vive is a total commitment.
[194:48.57]And I have to be certain that it's possible to do.
[194:50.29]I need a tree.
[194:52.23]Because once I go in that thing, I had a conversation with the talc about it earlier today.
[195:01.65]It's like, oh, am I going to stream Vive today?
[195:03.17]Maybe the internet might not work.
[195:05.07]Let me, like, get the fucking, like, a gigantic robot outfit.
[195:09.59]And, like, put lighthouses all over my room and the stream turns off in 45 minutes.
[195:13.49]And just be like, well, that was fucking dumb.
[195:18.37]Can I even climb this tree?
[195:19.49]Let me just make sure I can climb the trees here.
[195:29.88]How do you determine if you can climb a tree?
[195:36.35]Yeah, I saw there was tons of recommendations for VR.
[195:42.83]There's so many things to do.
[195:45.69]It's actually kind of overwhelming how many fucking Vive games there are that I haven't played.
[196:04.98]My show is the number one.
[196:07.22]And I'm not even certain I'm going to do that tomorrow.
[196:11.62]Or the next day, depending, again, on how this internet works out.
[196:27.50]Where are the giraffes?
[196:36.16]I gotta go to, like, a pool somewhere.
[196:40.87]If you don't know what Mindshow is, Mindshow is a VR game.
[196:43.97]It's not really a game, it's more of an experience.
[196:47.89]Where you... get into the VR shit, and you make scenes, and make your own movie.
[196:55.38]TV show... skit thing.
[196:59.04]It's very much like you control the movies.
[197:04.40]In a way, the sets, the set pieces... I'm really looking forward to it.
[197:10.41]Alright, here we go.
[197:13.63]That's a tree, I can get it.
[197:14.59]I didn't... there's a microphone built into the vibe too, which I didn't even know.
[197:27.89]So that's gonna be really interesting.
[197:32.13]Alright, nobody ever stop freaking out.
[197:33.23]I'm fine.
[197:34.31]I'm fine.
[197:34.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, don't run away.
[197:35.95]I just need to get your eye level in your face.
[197:37.73]This one didn't run.
[197:38.63]This one didn't run.
[197:41.21]The Vive mic sucks.
[197:43.40]Yeah, but it might be like fun to use it.
[197:46.86]Because my microphone setup is really not like the best in regards to standing in a room.
[197:51.80]Can you tell me I can't get in this tree?
[198:01.42]I can definitely get on this tree.
[198:02.62]I have to be able to.
[198:03.32]Lookit, it's perfect.
[198:04.04]Alright, what the hell was that?
[198:23.62]How am I gonna get this?
[198:25.02]I gotta be right in their face?
[198:29.88]This is not, like, right in their face.
[198:34.64]He's got to get much closer.
[198:42.77]Just throw the camera.
[198:47.21]God damn it, turn around.
[198:48.07]I wonder if they'll come over to the tree and eat.
[198:54.90]Get the zebra picture, too.
[199:00.26]Don't feel discouraged if it takes you a couple streams to overcome some technical hurdles with VR streaming.
[199:06.44]Yeah, I'm trying to be as prepared as possible.
[199:10.48]Because I know there's a lot of things that can go wrong in VR streaming.
[199:15.81]So, I'm making sure to make sure the room is set up completely perfect.
[199:21.85]The games I all have to, like, work.
[199:29.37]I'm just fucking happy the internet works.
[199:37.70]No, I have to have patience now.
[199:39.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[199:40.80]No, I don't.
[199:42.32]You just turn your head this way.
[199:45.64]And that should be alright.
[199:46.42]Turn this way.
[199:47.09]Come on, turn your head this way.
[199:48.19]Do it!
[200:03.21]No, my fucking zoom!
[200:05.01]He's coming this way!
[200:25.36]Turn!
[200:27.36]Turn, turn your head.
[200:45.71]I think I got it.
[200:46.26]Let's take a look.
[200:50.88]I didn't have time to mess with settings there.
[200:52.72]I had to go to auto.
[200:55.66]There it is.
[200:57.35]Ah, it could be that one though.
[201:00.01]That one's good too.
[201:03.65]It's probably this one.
[201:05.51]Or this one.
[201:12.75]I should have done vertical.
[201:13.87]Oh, yeah, shit, you're right.
[201:15.11]I'm gonna stay here.
[201:21.89]He'll come back.
[201:26.50]I always use manual.
[201:28.08]Well, I got a real camera, not a video game camera.
[201:35.25]Let's try it again.
[201:53.44]I do realize now this stream is just me taking photos of animals.
[201:56.22]Like, oh, look at that one.
[201:56.94]Oh, it's good.
[202:01.78]Look.
[202:03.96]You got the little one and you got the big one.
[202:13.51]Opportunity here.
[202:14.21]Hold on.
[202:14.53]Stay there.
[202:23.99]idiot.
[202:24.25]You just ruined the whole thing.
[202:26.35]This would've been so cute.
[202:29.21]Go.
[202:29.51]Move.
[202:33.20]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[202:34.70]Black and white.
[202:35.22]It's off.
[202:36.06]It's all fucked up.
[202:36.72]Doesn't matter.
[202:44.32]Could've got his face.
[202:48.19]Please move out of the way so I can get this.
[202:49.89]I'm gonna have to crop you out.
[202:51.15]Nice.
[202:51.83]Nice work.
[202:53.73]Thanks a lot.
[202:56.39]Not bad.
[202:56.72]Do what you want.
[202:57.36]Go over there and... Dickheads.
[203:01.78]Do that on purpose.
[203:05.44]No, no, no.
[203:05.96]Wait.
[203:06.22]Stop.
[203:06.50]Stop.
[203:08.14]This is perfect.
[203:08.71]Let's go to auto.
[203:09.33]I don't care.
[203:11.55]No black and white.
[203:13.21]This is the one.
[203:23.64]Turn.
[203:23.74]Turn.
[203:24.54]Turn your head.
[203:27.63]Turn your head.
[203:33.91]Turn your head this way.
[203:34.57]Come on.
[203:42.67]Oh!
[203:42.85]That was not good.
[203:44.85]It was close, but not great.
[203:52.40]Maybe you'll do it.
[204:08.72]I could... One... I'm going to turn up the... Hold on.
[204:17.24]Because he's going to turn his head, and I'm going to get it right when he turns.
[204:19.89]It's not going to be blurry.
[204:22.65]I've got some good shotter watches ready.
[204:24.17]He's going to turn, and I'm going to get it right when he's mid-turned.
[204:26.19]Get the camera right here.
[204:28.57]Snap it when he gets out.
[204:29.89]He's going to be... He's facing across the plane here.
[204:40.71]Why is this black and white?
[204:41.69]What the fuck?
[204:42.68]I didn't do that.
[204:56.30]Turn slightly.
[205:00.92]Turn slightly.
[205:01.52]Here it comes.
[205:02.18]You went the wrong way.
[205:02.86]God damn it.
[205:05.50]If he had turned this way.
[205:08.74]Look, it's like you're riding him.
[205:12.15]I got it, I got it.
[205:12.81]I think this one's fine.
[205:14.69]Let me just take a look.
[205:24.84]I got a secret bird!
[205:35.45]I'll take the secret bird any day.
[205:39.75]I like that one.
[205:42.07]secret bird see how cute that would have been if I had that framed up and all three of them were there that would have been such a great picture thank the dumb zebra that screwed it all up uh if somebody's give a hundred dollars 100 bucks
[206:08.39]Cyclops Parker, thanks for the hundred dollars.
[206:11.09]10,000 bits.
[206:13.68]Shitload.
[206:14.08]They say, hey Jerem, I've been watching you for years now, but I can rarely catch the streams live.
[206:22.10]Happy to be here.
[206:22.99]Just wanted to help keep you doing what you do.
[206:29.29]Thank you so much, Cyclops Parker.
[206:31.43]That's fucking incredible.
[206:32.29]Thank you.
[206:34.49]Uh, if you can't catch, as long as, you know, you want to jump in when you can, and you feel like being here, that's, you're not under any obligation to come to every stream.
[206:46.16]But, I really appreciate it.
[206:50.06]If you come here and you're happy, that's fucking awesome.
[206:53.46]Thanks for stopping in.
[206:55.00]And thank you for the hundred dollars.
[207:03.89]So I got that photo.
[207:08.15]It's covering the fees.
[207:10.61]No, no, that's incredibly fucking generous and nice of anybody to give that much money or even any amount of money.
[207:19.45]So, thank you.
[207:22.59]Do I have another opportunity for a fucking secret bird?
[207:24.85]Did you see that?
[207:26.13]I missed it.
[207:28.51]I want to get a close-up of that bird.
[207:36.39]Oh, I'll get you motherfucker.
[207:37.46]Just you wait.
[208:05.69]I would have had three there.
[208:11.36]This is so relaxing.
[208:12.86]Why don't they make another one of these?
[208:14.22]Somebody.
[208:19.59]Make like an incredibly detailed version of this.
[208:25.64]Just go do it in real life.
[208:27.70]I can't do this.
[208:30.89]A VR game where you do this.
[208:33.02]Does that exist?
[208:34.04]If it does, I'm going to play it.
[208:34.96]Alright, here we go.
[208:36.30]Here's another opportunity for a decent one.
[208:45.41]Damn it.
[208:49.07]I'm going to run into photos here if I'm not careful.
[208:51.47]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[208:52.29]Let's get the zebra face and then move on.
[209:03.16]Jerma smell's too bad to do this.
[209:04.78]What the hell are you talking about?
[209:08.81]I don't know if that's gonna fly here.
[209:13.25]I don't know if that's gonna work.
[209:18.01]Closer?
[209:19.65]How close can I get?
[209:21.86]Don't overdo it.
[209:28.42]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[209:29.26]Drop that.
[209:29.70]Drop that.
[209:30.16]Drop that.
[209:30.60]Drop that.
[209:35.91]And when I say drop it, I mean raise it.
[209:38.25]Are you gonna walk forward?
[209:39.75]Oh, get this on auto.
[209:40.67]Get the fuck... Oh, great.
[209:46.60]I think that's gonna be fine.
[209:48.36]That'll be worth it, I think.
[209:49.18]Let's get out of here.
[209:58.75]Got the giraffe.
[209:59.41]I got his face.
[210:00.49]Let's go.
[210:00.93]Back to base camp.
[210:05.85]Apparently there's first person too.
[210:06.95]I just figured that out right now.
[210:08.44]Somehow.
[210:13.34]Alright, let's see.
[210:16.78]Transfer the photos in.
[210:17.56]Mmm, some good ones.
[210:23.66]Alright.
[210:28.74]Giraffe at eye level.
[210:31.53]I don't have a lens that's good enough to do this.
[210:33.13]Alright, it's close enough.
[210:35.79]It's this one right here, right?
[210:37.93]Yeah.
[210:39.31]That's eye level.
[210:41.99]Uh, LovingFox just gave six community subs.
[210:45.62]Thank you, LovingFox.
[210:46.46]Thank you for the six.
[211:00.67]How is that target not more than great?
[211:05.45]Because his head is tilted a little too much?
[211:09.44]Apparently.
[211:09.92]Alright, now here we go.
[211:13.72]Is this good enough?
[211:18.18]I don't know, like... That's as best as I'm gonna get with this lens.
[211:37.02]Really?
[211:42.62]Okay.
[211:44.64]This one is the... Get a close-up of an African buffalo.
[211:49.67]Try and get as close to a vicious buffalo as you can.
[211:51.57]We're looking for a dynamic, really tense shot.
[211:54.55]I gotta know where the car is.
[211:56.59]The car is gonna be right behind me.
[212:04.30]And this one is already here.
[212:05.52]Wait!
[212:05.90]Secret bird.
[212:13.77]We can go.
[212:15.23]Is there a better one?
[212:15.75]That's it.
[212:27.86]That's pretty good.
[212:32.14]The Superb Starling.
[212:33.76]Adult.
[212:34.20]Alright, let's go get killed by a buffalo.
[212:46.42]Use the brushes cover.
[212:48.42]Can I just do it now?
[212:49.98]No, I gotta go to bed.
[212:59.09]I love the plane sound effect when you email pictures.
[213:05.07]We might have more to do, though.
[213:06.19]Let's see.
[213:07.10]Where's the wall here?
[213:18.29]Play another game.
[213:20.60]This is the plan.
[213:21.28]This is a game that I wanted to play for a little while.
[213:25.26]And I'm just hanging out and playing it.
[213:37.05]We are on the PlayStation 3, so even if there was something else I wanted to do, I would have to kind of set up something else and not capture my PlayStation 3.
[213:49.51]And there's nothing really that's ready to go right this second.
[213:51.45]Because remember, I didn't even know the stream was going to happen today.
[213:54.85]So I knew that I had this game, and that if I could stream, I was going to try it.
[214:00.52]So this stream was not really supposed to happen.
[214:03.22]But I'm so glad it did, because now I know that the internet works.
[214:14.79]And I'm stuck.
[214:22.25]I'm just poking fun.
[214:23.11]No, I know.
[214:23.67]I just want people to be aware.
[214:26.29]That's why I'm kind of just playing a take photos of animals safari game.
[214:31.04]Because I got, there's a lot of others, there's a lot of vibe shit to do, but like I said before, I just want to make sure that I'm able to stay alive for more than five fucking hours.
[214:43.27]What happened there?
[214:48.37]Alright.
[214:48.73]Tense buffalo close-up of a buffalo's angry face.
[214:51.65]Is it possible to roll the car?
[214:57.16]No, you can't roll the car and you can't run over any animals.
[215:00.04]I'm sorry, everybody.
[215:01.30]I don't know why I have to apologize for that.
[215:06.48]That should be like, oh, that's good that you can't do that.
[215:12.77]I gotta pick a beeline for the car.
[215:15.53]After getting this picture.
[215:27.36]After we get this photo, though, there's probably going to be another super mission.
[215:35.95]I'm glad you can't hurt the animals.
[215:37.41]That's what I was saying.
[215:39.38]I wasn't saying I'm sad that I can't run them over.
[215:51.55]This is a pretty good sit-on-the-couch-and-have-your-mouth-open game, though.
[215:56.19]It definitely is.
[216:06.98]I would play this game with, like, a niece or a nephew.
[216:12.53]And be like, oh, can you, I don't see, do you see the buffaloes anywhere?
[216:14.71]Right there!
[216:17.45]No, you're right, you're right, yeah!
[216:18.85]Should we go take a photo?
[216:33.52]He's a boomer uncle.
[216:36.42]What's wrong with that?
[216:37.24]What's wrong with being like an uncle?
[216:39.38]That's not a problem.
[216:47.77]Oh, that kinda hurt my head.
[217:02.48]Yeah, anything is, like, boomer to a lot of you guys, apparently.
[217:07.89]How do I not be, like, a quote, boomer?
[217:10.97]What if I told you guys I eat, like, candy?
[217:14.59]And then, okay, so if I ate a bunch of candy and was in the first grade, would I still be a boomer?
[217:27.36]Yes.
[217:28.63]Yes.
[217:38.41]You were born in 1985.
[217:39.11]I know, but I'm just saying, like, what if I wasn't?
[217:48.38]Yeah, I went to the dentist today.
[217:50.06]What a boomer.
[217:52.41]Teeth health is a boomer thing?
[217:59.43]Where the fuck are these buffaloes?
[218:12.33]What kind of question is that?
[218:21.96]Where did it go?
[218:23.66]Ooh!
[218:24.28]Okay, come here.
[218:26.42]Those are elephants.
[218:27.04]I found elephants.
[218:29.54]Everybody just woke the fuck up now.
[218:31.16]Hey, if you're watching and you were like kind of drifting off and like hanging out and not excited about this stream because it's just kind of a chill stream.
[218:38.30]Wake!
[218:39.68]Wake up!
[218:40.76]Time to get up.
[218:49.07]What?
[219:00.78]Never mind, go back to bed.
[219:03.79]Sorry I woke you up for that.
[219:22.53]A bunch of people probably did just, like, wake up from just, like, kicking... they got, like, drifted off.
[219:27.06]There's an invisible wall to hide the elephants, apparently.
[219:36.39]Well, I got photos of them.
[219:38.65]I thought they were buffalo at first.
[219:48.21]Well, that's like the edge of the universe right there.
[219:49.71]Even the edge of the universe.
[219:52.33]Stop.
[219:58.30]Don't get up.
[220:02.72]No, no, no.
[220:03.38]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[220:09.30]Not fast enough.
[220:10.04]Hold on.
[220:10.40]They're going to land.
[220:15.59]Right here.
[220:21.89]I gotta get a good swampy moss photo with some... Whatever.
[220:44.48]Why do I have red eyes?
[220:54.17]God damn it.
[220:54.55]Whatever.
[221:00.00]Oh, you keep coming in right when I stop doing that.
[221:03.24]Whatever.
[221:04.70]I'll never get the perfect photo again.
[221:06.02]Don't speak so soon here.
[221:17.70]Turn.
[221:22.14]Is anyone coming in?
[221:23.92]I have to stay in the same spot.
[221:25.85]This guy's going to turn around and fly back overhead.
[221:32.11]Yeah, I'm fishing for shots.
[221:33.11]It sucks.
[221:35.93]You have to let the wildlife come to you.
[221:37.59]You can't go to the wildlife.
[221:41.06]Eventually, just aim your camera out your window.
[221:44.54]Eventually, a rhino will walk by.
[221:45.94]You have to do it for a long time.
[221:59.32]Come on.
[222:00.18]Somebody turn.
[222:03.46]We got one coming in right here, don't we?
[222:06.40]Did it turn?
[222:06.92]I don't think so.
[222:09.70]No, they're all flying this way.
[222:11.51]Hold on.
[222:17.57]I'm in a bad place.
[222:18.55]Bad spot.
[222:27.40]God damn it.
[222:31.49]Wait.
[222:40.49]I don't even know what that is.
[222:46.38]Let me find it.
[222:46.86]Let me do the mission at hand here.
[222:49.22]Let's find the buffalo.
[222:58.64]Chat has voted to adjust Jerma's height to 3 feet.
[223:08.61]I love how that's an adjustment.
[223:10.17]That's an- oh boy, that's an adjustment.
[223:13.17]Alright, here we go.
[223:13.79]We need an aggressive shot.
[223:15.17]Keep the engine running.
[223:18.19]Here we go.
[223:18.53]He's gonna turn around and run directly behind me.
[223:20.99]An angry face.
[223:32.88]Okay.
[223:34.96]Get close enough.
[223:35.62]Where's this other one?
[223:39.04]He's gonna get close.
[223:39.75]Wait till he gets closer.
[223:41.53]Oh, shit.
[223:42.11]Okay, hold on.
[223:42.55]No, no, no, no, no.
[223:52.26]Not tense enough.
[223:53.10]It needs to be angry.
[224:04.48]Okay, here we go, here we go.
[224:05.32]Get ready, ready, ready, ready, one!
[224:10.21]Holy fuck, that's a great one!
[224:16.19]Get in the car!
[224:22.25]Oh, that was good!
[224:23.65]Get me out of here, get me out of here.
[224:32.26]I gotta take a look at that one.
[224:38.89]That's gotta be worth some money.
[224:40.47]This thing was about to kill me.
[224:49.93]That was a great one!
[224:58.10]I said that really fucking weirdly.
[224:59.84]I wanna hear how I said that, that was really strange.
[225:06.65]I said that weird, right?
[225:07.35]Something about that was off.
[225:08.44]I don't know why.
[225:12.58]Alright, let's get out of here
[225:38.64]Accent.
[225:47.63]Fuck, that's a great one, mate!
[225:50.67]That is a good one, though.
[225:52.53]I'm gonna tell ya.
[225:55.91]Is that my- that's probably- that's my normal voice?
[226:00.71]Does that- does that sound like that?
[226:09.35]Take your photo.
[226:11.39]This better get in the magazine.
[226:16.86]Marvelous.
[226:17.56]Marvelous.
[226:18.32]All marvelous.
[226:20.00]That's bullshit.
[226:21.64]How would I get closer?
[226:22.66]Are you trying to make this photographer die?
[226:28.11]How would you get closer than I did?
[226:31.05]I was seconds away from being killed.
[226:34.27]That's not close enough, apparently.
[226:40.32]Congratulations!
[226:41.24]Published in the magazine Nature Power.
[226:43.50]Check the bookshelf to view your own published photos.
[226:47.54]Nice.
[226:47.80]Okay, what about this one?
[226:49.98]Oh, we had a picture of elephants, right?
[226:51.26]Yeah, there's some weird fucking bird.
[226:56.77]Who cares?
[226:57.19]Just give me the money.
[227:05.19]For the record, that's a better photo than the almost-dying, charging buffalo.
[227:26.67]What else am I missing here?
[227:27.59]Oh, these.
[227:29.85]Did I get these already?
[227:30.87]I don't think so.
[227:39.10]Yeah, I already had a picture of them.
[227:41.82]I do have the distance elephants.
[227:44.94]This is such a bad photo of elephants, but you know what?
[227:47.79]I just want the data.
[227:55.81]Oh, the distance is terrible, but it's okay.
[228:02.53]African elephant, African elephant.
[228:03.98]Alright.
[228:08.38]Cool.
[228:09.56]Let me go look at my published work.
[228:12.64]Let's see.
[228:15.33]National Geographic.
[228:16.03]Let's take a look inside the... Let's find our photos.
[228:20.99]Okay.
[228:21.35]Monthly nature power.
[228:28.43]The African buffalo are grazers, eating grass and leaves off trees.
[228:32.31]Those are real photos, and then mine's a fake one.
[228:37.21]Imagine you wouldn't get away with that, if this was a real magazine.
[228:40.91]Like, very clearly, the one on the left is not real.
[228:47.94]Trying to pull that off, like it's a computer-generated image.
[228:50.56]Somebody's not gonna pick up on that.
[229:01.77]That's a great picture.
[229:07.17]I'm shitting on the PlayStation 3 graphics.
[229:09.01]No, I'm saying that the photos on the right are real photos.
[229:13.47]This could be on the PS4.
[229:14.51]This could be on a GTX 2080 of max settings on the Frostbite engine.
[229:23.01]And that's still not a real buffalo over there.
[229:27.88]The real photos look worse.
[229:37.78]They don't look worse.
[229:39.86]Hang that one on the wall.
[229:40.82]But I can't take this one down.
[229:42.48]This is me and my friend.
[229:51.80]No, I can't do that.
[230:07.55]Let's take a look.
[230:08.21]We should have news.
[230:09.48]Here we go.
[230:11.58]Big ticket item.
[230:12.28]Need a shot of the herd's top trumpet.
[230:27.08]This is strange for me to say this, but I can't tell.
[230:30.54]Is that video playing here on the right claymation?
[230:35.96]It feels like it's stop motion.
[230:38.22]The background doesn't look real.
[230:42.14]That's not claymation going on?
[230:53.48]Wait, no.
[230:54.35]Look at the end.
[230:54.99]Watch the end.
[230:58.27]It's like over animated.
[231:00.99]That's not real.
[231:03.07]Alright, take the, uh, each African elephant herd has a boss who holds it together.
[231:07.13]Could you take a photo of one?
[231:16.04]That background's not real.
[231:17.62]That is not a real background.
[231:18.60]That's not a set.
[231:19.42]That's a set somewhere.
[231:20.60]Look at the clouds.
[231:21.20]Look behind them.
[231:23.64]They manufactured that.
[231:29.80]I'll be right.
[231:30.24]That's fine.
[231:41.11]What a narcissistic thing to say.
[231:44.85]So, how do you tell the difference between a boss and the others?
[231:47.69]They battle to determine who gets the position.
[231:50.57]The winner must have a certain qualities.
[231:53.67]Fierce looking tusks, for example.
[231:56.77]So, big tusks.
[231:58.35]We gotta find the big boss.
[232:09.52]I can't do that.
[232:13.41]Okay, uh, also... See, this is real.
[232:16.83]That looks real to me.
[232:23.39]I'm working as a photographer lately, trying to steal my business, eh?
[232:25.69]Just kidding.
[232:26.91]You ever heard of a bird called the cattle egret?
[232:30.13]They travel with large herbivores as a rule.
[232:32.56]I got the request for a photo for a cattle egret and African elephant together.
[232:37.68]But I'm too busy.
[232:38.30]Think you could get the shot for me?
[232:44.03]take a look at that way that elephant looks in the background in the foreground look at the claymation okay I'm out of here I'm sorry I'm sorry if only they'd come a little closer let's continue to observe the herd that spot just off mazumoha pond with the anthill will be the perfect place to watch them from
[233:15.45]That's what... I saw them already.
[233:16.87]I have to save the game.
[233:18.82]I'm sorry.
[233:19.12]I'm going to spend like five minutes saving this.
[233:41.45]Game sucks.
[233:42.07]Please play I Spy Spooky Mansion again.
[233:44.41]No, I like this.
[233:48.04]We're not going to do this for that much longer.
[233:50.06]This is the internet test stream.
[233:52.02]Don't you guys understand?
[233:53.35]Don't you understand?
[233:53.93]Here it is.
[233:55.47]Bingo.
[234:11.46]You've been playing for five hours?
[234:12.80]No, I haven't.
[234:16.20]I've only been playing for like four?
[234:17.85]Three and a half?
[234:19.95]Remember, I spent 30 minutes creating my character.
[234:21.91]That doesn't really count as playing.
[234:26.23]Play Space Channel 5.
[234:26.95]I want to watch Ooh La La.
[234:31.92]I have it.
[234:33.19]but I can't do that because that would require me to take down the PS3 and hook up and plug everything in and get everything set up for the Dreamcast, which the Dreamcast is in the closet right now.
[234:48.73]That's like a 20 minute, like I gotta make sure the audio works and not gonna happen.
[234:55.01]But, oh, hold on a second though.
[234:56.85]Wait a minute, I gotta show you this.
[234:58.32]Cause this came in the fucking mail.
[235:08.91]Something finally came in the mail, guys.
[235:18.21]Yep.
[235:19.21]Something that people have been waiting for for a while.
[235:21.93]Me too.
[235:23.22]I had some issues with the mail.
[235:27.62]Where is it?
[235:28.06]Where are they?
[235:28.50]Where are they?
[235:29.30]And they finally came in.
[235:30.88]I'm going to finally prove that I own this.
[235:32.14]Because everybody is so fucking annoyed at me for not proving that I own this.
[235:37.74]That's right, the Seaman webcam.
[235:39.86]There it is.
[235:40.62]The Seaman microphone.
[235:46.55]I got it.
[235:47.99]So we can actually play that game.
[235:52.79]What's wrong with it?
[235:53.49]I look weird.
[235:54.83]Get that off.
[236:00.98]Yeah, it actually came.
[236:07.79]We demand Pikachu socks.
[236:08.97]I don't even know what that is.
[236:21.62]You look like, oh, I look like a man in a clay.
[236:24.67]Do I, am I claymation?
[236:38.18]I do look like I made out of clay!
[236:40.72]Am I real?
[236:55.02]I made out of fucking clay today, I don't know why.
[237:00.96]I got a greasy face?
[237:02.16]No, that's just the clay drying.
[237:04.14]Relax.
[237:10.64]Alright, what the fuck was I doing?
[237:11.70]Now I'm gonna be so self-conscious.
[237:13.64]Forever.
[237:14.16]FOREVER!
[237:15.90]Look what you've done to me!
[237:16.98]LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!
[237:17.74]Alright, if you guys had to, like, if you're like in a room, right?
[237:28.40]It's like a dark room and all of a sudden fucking TVs turn on.
[237:33.78]Two TVs back to back.
[237:37.65]And, like, you had one second, and then the TV's... Like, which one of these is clay?
[237:44.86]I gotta do the same motions as the elephant.
[237:48.16]Like, bam!
[237:49.20]TV... Alright, I'll do it for you.
[237:50.28]Ready?
[238:04.05]Which one of those is clay?
[238:04.69]Okay.
[238:19.01]Stand up and do it.
[238:20.63]I'm not fucking standing up and doing that.
[238:23.49]Not a chance.
[238:28.54]That's just old.
[238:32.30]Why are you putting the fucking birthing scene from Outlast 2?
[238:35.27]Why would you put that here?
[238:47.86]I don't know why that's there.
[238:49.95]What was that shit-eating grin?
[238:51.13]I made it a fucking clay.
[238:52.03]I gotta get out of here.
[238:52.97]I'm not on camera ever again.
[238:53.99]Can I get a haircut?
[239:04.56]I can't.
[239:12.85]Yeah, I can't get a haircut.
[239:14.65]Why would I get a haircut?
[239:17.37]That's a shitload of blood vessels.
[239:19.03]Each individual here is a blood vessel.
[239:20.52]I don't want to cut them and bleed and shit.
[240:02.35]Jerma's alternative facts are fucking out of hand.
[240:08.85]Alright, what's the deal here?
[240:15.49]I need to get an elephant.
[240:19.81]I gotta get the boss of the elephant.
[240:32.52]Do hair have nerve endings?
[240:33.62]No.
[240:33.86]They just bleed, and it's weird.
[240:37.83]When you snip the ends of one hair, it's just a little bit of blood.
[240:40.83]Like, two or three droplets come out of each strand.
[240:45.67]That's why I hate going to the barber.
[240:47.87]I hate going to the dentist.
[240:49.03]I hate going to the doctor.
[240:49.93]That's really going to stop me.
[241:09.00]Can I just go to the wetlands, please?
[241:30.09]Don't you guys know the golden rule of this stream?
[241:32.69]How are you guys losing the golden rule of this stream?
[241:39.10]Treat others the way that you would like to be 95% of everything I say is a lie.
[241:59.01]Alright, elephant.
[242:15.46]And people, you know, somebody says, well, hold on a minute.
[242:18.88]If 90 to 95% of everything you say is bullshit and just made up, then what about, like, all the times when you say things that are, like, really nice and, like, you're not, like, messing around?
[242:28.17]So everything you say is a lie?
[242:30.35]Well, think of how many dumb fucking things I say, right?
[242:33.47]I probably say a hundred stupid things being broadcasted, right?
[242:38.47]Five of those things were definitely legit.
[242:40.16]They had to be.
[242:40.50]Now, where are the elephants?
[242:59.33]They're like on the edge, right?
[243:02.15]How am I gonna get to snap the elephant boss when I can't even go over to see them?
[243:10.68]They're all down there.
[243:11.44]I can't go over there.
[243:16.18]How do we know that wasn't a lie?
[243:19.99]I can't... I don't know, and I won't show you.
[243:25.55]A herd of African elephants coming this way.
[243:27.91]The herd is on the move.
[243:35.78]Alright, we're looking for the one with the big tusks.
[243:38.98]And... It's like the elephant... The king of the elephants, right?
[243:43.60]Alright, I'll move.
[243:47.60]Which one of these is the boss?
[243:50.28]It says you can tell because they start fighting.
[243:52.72]And they have big tusks.
[243:59.74]One of the little ones is probably the boss?
[244:03.95]Well, this is not a Looney Tunes cartoon.
[244:08.26]So I'm going to say the answer to that is probably no.
[244:24.01]Is that the leader?
[244:24.61]That's the one that's leading everybody here.
[244:27.41]That could be the one.
[244:34.07]What about Boss Baby?
[244:39.64]What?
[244:40.28]No.
[244:47.02]That's like a meme answer.
[244:48.38]You know, that's like... Boss Baby is currently like a funny meme right now, right?
[244:53.71]That's not a bad shot of all the elephants.
[244:57.29]This one has to be the leader.
[245:01.05]They're all following the leader.
[245:06.05]I'm not going to get run over, right?
[245:15.12]Yeah, this has to be the leader.
[245:16.52]Why would they all be following this one elephant here?
[245:25.69]Unless I'm missing something.
[245:33.39]This one has like a broken top.
[245:34.52]This one's been in a bunch of fights.
[245:37.21]I'm going to say it's probably this one.
[245:41.11]Oh, the one in the back?
[245:41.99]The one in the back has huge tusks.
[245:43.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[245:45.31]It actually might be the one all the way in the back.
[245:48.36]See how big the tusks are on that one?
[245:49.74]Let's see.
[245:55.06]Look.
[245:55.24]Ready?
[245:56.02]This one has a kind of broken tusk.
[245:57.38]That one has gigantic teeth.
[246:00.44]Much bigger than anybody else.
[246:01.42]It's definitely that one back there.
[246:23.17]Gotta get closer.
[246:28.95]Am I gonna be safe here?
[246:29.79]That's a bad photo.
[246:33.09]It's not you, I need the other one.
[246:48.84]Oh fuck, I can't move, I can't move, I can't move, don't move, don't move.
[246:51.55]Oh god, don't move.
[246:53.96]Oh, fuck.
[246:54.50]Okay, gotta run.
[246:55.06]Where's the Jeep?
[246:59.70]It's all the way back there.
[247:00.86]Oh, fuck.
[247:01.50]Oh, no.
[247:01.89]I'm gonna die.
[247:03.67]I'm good.
[247:03.91]Alright, where's the leader?
[247:07.37]I'm gonna wrap around here.
[247:12.87]There's the leader right there.
[247:17.29]God, perfect opportunity to get in front.
[247:19.12]Right here.
[247:30.05]Oh, come here, you majestic bastard.
[247:32.81]Got it.
[247:33.93]I can get a better one than that, though.
[247:36.19]He's gonna look right in the camera.
[247:37.15]Just get it.
[247:40.51]That's good.
[247:40.85]That's good.
[247:41.17]That looks good.
[247:44.96]Perfect.
[247:55.36]Key pose to assert dominance.
[247:58.94]No, don't look at me.
[248:03.21]Las Vegas photographer dies attempting to get pictures of elephant boss baby.
[248:16.96]Okay.
[248:20.36]I need the elephant birds, too.
[248:22.84]Yeah, but where are they?
[248:23.46]They're not going anywhere.
[248:24.27]I need to get back in the car.
[248:25.67]Because look at how far away this is.
[248:30.88]How much longer am I going to be playing?
[248:32.00]I don't know.
[248:33.06]Maybe like another... Like another hour or so?
[248:36.91]Hour or two?
[248:37.39]I don't know.
[248:40.35]I'm still enjoying my time.
[248:41.59]We're just kind of hanging out, talking about 95% of everything I say is lie.
[248:44.73]It's one of those things.
[248:52.38]Eric literally does not do anything.
[248:59.15]No, Eric does not do anything.
[249:00.31]You're right.
[249:00.61]But here they go.
[249:01.29]They're going to, like, the... swamp thing here.
[249:05.44]Birds.
[249:05.80]What, what, what?
[249:06.38]It wants a symbiotic relationship thing?
[249:08.96]What does it want me to do?
[249:13.82]African elephant's avian sidekick.
[249:17.02]Shows cattle egret.
[249:18.70]Shows African elephant.
[249:19.80]So they have to just hang out together.
[249:24.96]Are these egrets?
[249:28.42]Are those egrets?
[249:29.96]That's an egret right here, right?
[249:33.05]Is it?
[249:41.37]Get in the tree.
[249:42.45]Right?
[249:44.21]Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[249:46.25]Car, car, car.
[249:46.79]Get in the tree.
[249:47.29]I'll get it.
[249:47.91]Watch this.
[249:48.23]I'm gonna get in the tree.
[249:55.53]I'm gonna cross.
[249:56.11]There's gonna be a bunch of egrets.
[250:14.26]Get fucking up there.
[250:15.70]Why can't I go up for this?
[250:16.64]Oh, God.
[250:27.51]Eric is not dumb.
[250:29.43]Eric's pretty dumb.
[250:35.93]Alright, the question is, I need them to walk by.
[250:38.05]I need an egret.
[251:01.00]It's no egrets.
[251:08.77]Didn't say that they hang out together here.
[251:10.29]Where are they going?
[251:30.52]Oh, this is bullshit.
[251:36.72]Should I pull back?
[251:38.50]Does that count?
[251:39.18]Is that an egret right there?
[251:41.06]It might be.
[251:41.44]Alright.
[251:41.96]Okay, there's like a weird bug in the background.
[251:44.40]There's a smudge on the camera lens, but I think it was an egret.
[251:54.36]Is that an egret?
[251:57.21]Does that count?
[252:00.47]I don't know if that counts.
[252:14.74]Alright, well, hopefully that was one of them.
[252:16.60]Let's see where else they go.
[252:28.09]6 FPS.
[252:28.99]Playmation Elephants.
[252:30.07]No, I got it.

[252:43.00]That was the Herd's Leader, yeah.
[252:48.14]I got him.
[252:57.34]Alright.
[253:04.38]It is this one.
[253:06.60]Which one's better?
[253:08.30]Hmm.
[253:10.94]Probably that one.
[253:14.15]This one's a little more clear.
[253:16.91]But this one is a better action shot.
[253:25.41]I'm gonna go with this one.
[253:29.23]What we get?
[253:35.01]It's alright, I'll bet.
[253:35.89]I got a B. Then the... I don't even... Do I even have... I don't know if I even have this correct.
[253:48.56]This is such a... This is so half-assed.
[253:52.95]This is the equivalent of you figuring out that you had homework in Homeroom.
[253:58.62]And you filled in random answers on your math sheet.
[254:03.18]At least you did it.
[254:03.74]It's gonna have to be this first one.
[254:16.09]Is that even the right bird?
[254:17.05]I don't even know if that's the right one.
[254:25.39]Whatever.
[254:36.58]At least I turned it in.
[254:37.72]I turned in the homework.
[254:44.90]I still need this one.
[254:45.68]I need new stuff to unlock.
[254:50.95]I got the tent.
[254:53.31]Give me a new camera.

[255:28.37]Isn't a tweet 150?
[255:30.57]No, it's 140 characters.
[255:31.63]Oh, it's an easy essay meme in 2019.
[255:40.41]Oh.
[255:46.27]Every copypasta always works.
[255:51.70]I don't pay attention to this shit.
[255:55.29]I'm not going to like fucking copy pasta wiki and looking up what's the latest copy pasta that came out like two months ago.
[256:04.48]I barely go see movies that come out.

[256:21.14]Get me a really cute little tyke.
[256:23.60]One whose tusks haven't grown in yet.
[256:26.31]Wow, this is difficult, apparently.
[256:27.61]Do I have to get it fallen down?
[256:32.63]This is apparently very difficult.
[256:35.07]Baby African elephant.
[256:40.77]With little tusks.
[256:42.99]No tusks.
[256:43.79]Okay.

[263:26.41]I'll try.
[263:27.84]He's like, uh-oh, uh... Hello, hello!
[263:37.54]It was something like that, right?
[263:47.27]Are those, like, only elephants that are gonna spawn?
[264:01.63]I don't know why I'm just thinking about this.
[264:04.15]I don't know why I thought this was funny.
[264:05.71]It's, like, bad.
[264:11.77]I was just... For some reason, I was hoping a low branch was going to hang and hit this guy in the face.
[264:16.08]It's not that funny.
[264:22.64]Oh, you know what?
[264:23.16]It might have been.
[264:24.08]It might have been.
[264:25.43]Oh!

[264:38.07]Baby.
[264:40.01]12 o'clock.
[264:52.17]This baby doesn't... You know what?
[264:55.11]You're gonna have to deal with the picture I give you, because...
[264:58.25]If there's no spawned in elephants that are babies with no tusks, then it's... I'm not going to be able to get a picture of it.
[265:06.38]I literally cannot stand the presence of Eric.
[265:09.42]And all first person does is make him more prevalent in the shot.
[265:12.66]Alright, there's a lot of... Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[265:14.10]There's a lot of babies here.
[265:14.98]It looks like he's driving the car.
[265:17.87]There's stadium seating for some reason.
[265:19.63]Why?
[265:22.44]Pull up to the drive-thru.
[265:23.44]Not the drive-thru, the drive-in.
[265:25.98]Yeah, when you pull up to the drive-thru, he's got a better angle to speak.
[265:29.74]Right there.
[265:30.51]Baby with big tusks.
[265:36.63]I don't know, man.
[265:37.51]I don't know.
[265:38.55]The one right there has big tusks, too.
[265:40.39]Oh, fuck.
[265:53.63]You're just going to get a picture of a baby elephant, and that's pretty much what you're going to get.
[265:57.11]Sorry.
[265:58.39]They asked for no tusks?
[265:59.55]I know, but there are no tusks.
[266:01.68]They all have tusks.
[266:07.08]Just fucking Photoshop them out.
[266:11.56]Is it really going to be that hard for you just to take the paint tool and grab on a like color, the eyedropper thing, and just trace over the tusks?
[266:30.09]I don't give a shit.
[266:36.57]That's perfect.
[266:38.47]I'm out.
[266:50.37]Just make a clay elephant and photograph that.
[266:55.29]What other side mission do we have on?
[266:57.93]This weird one.
[266:59.09]Show a male Impala and two or more females.
[267:02.43]Let's get it.
[267:02.91]So this game is stupid.
[267:10.71]No it's not.
[267:15.18]This game is not stupid.
[267:16.16]Alright, that's pretty stupid.
[267:25.80]But as a whole, the game's not stupid.
[267:27.52]What does this game have for a rating?
[267:32.82]Okay, the title of the game is Africa.
[267:36.54]With a K. So look it up for me.
[267:38.88]What does it have on, like... What does it have on Internet Game News?
[267:44.39]Whatever, IGN.
[267:58.12]Three and a half out of ten on IGN.
[267:59.84]Alright, there is... I need three females.
[268:05.79]There's a male right there.
[268:07.23]One, two... No, I see one this way, though.
[268:17.36]It said on the thing, only desperate streamers would play this.
[268:23.23]See, I mean, that would be kind of funny if... I had an opportunity to take a picture when it was sprinting by and I didn't get it.
[268:29.01]It's alright.
[268:33.17]I see... I see a bunch of females.
[268:35.93]No, what I was going to tell you is... Fuck.
[268:50.42]I'm going to have to wait over here.
[268:54.40]What I was going to tell you... This is not Desperate Boomer Play... Why did I even add Boomer?
[268:59.62]I didn't even need to do that.
[269:01.78]Desperate Stream... No, no, no, no.
[269:02.79]This was... Does it say anywhere there about testing your internet?
[269:06.35]This is a test the internet game.
[269:08.41]If your internet works, then you can play it and stream it for a little while.
[269:12.83]Just to make sure the internet works, so when you do the real stream tomorrow, that you'll know the internet's going to stay on.
[269:18.15]Does it say that anywhere?
[269:20.11]Alright, what do we got?
[269:27.33]There's a male right there.
[269:28.47]I think this game's fun.
[269:34.68]Okay, got it.
[269:35.42]Right here.
[269:35.90]Come on.
[269:42.30]That male's right there.
[269:44.41]And at least three females.
[269:52.39]This is like Pokémon Snap without the fun of Pokémon.
[269:58.06]No, I gotta get a better shot of the male.
[270:12.14]That's not good.
[270:13.35]That's not good.
[270:15.73]I gotta get closer.
[270:16.99]This is the right shot though.
[270:18.33]Keep him right in the middle.
[270:30.67]Are they wagging their tails?
[270:35.90]Head up.
[270:40.76]I got it.
[270:41.14]I got it.
[270:46.90]He walked forward to zoom back out.
[270:48.60]Yeah, because of depth!
[270:55.26]Wait, we have another opportunity here for elephant.
[271:04.43]Baby elephant right here.
[271:07.66]Or maybe not, it's not a baby elephant.
[271:13.48]It's the same one I already took a picture of before.
[271:35.18]They don't seem to really want to protect this baby.
[271:41.00]I can get a great shot.
[271:42.44]The baby doesn't even... not gonna move?
[271:44.18]Alright, fine.
[271:46.48]No.
[271:50.24]Come here!
[271:59.41]That was close, I can get it again.
[272:00.37]Right when it crosses the plane.
[272:15.21]This thing can probably kill me?
[272:17.56]Nah, I can just leapfrog it.
[272:20.72]I have a thousand percent confidence that I could leapfrog that elephant if it charged at me.
[272:25.82]Just jump as high as you can, push down four arms hard as you can, up over the elephant.
[272:37.19]Alright, I got the fucking photo, let's go.
[272:47.45]I don't think anyone can do that.
[272:48.39]I think they could.
[272:55.23]The jackass guys used to do that all the time.
[272:58.32]They would, like, jump over shit.
[273:01.66]Alright.
[273:04.60]I'm pretty sure Steve-O has done what I just said.
[273:07.54]In a jackass episode.
[273:17.82]Let's get a good one.
[273:21.84]Baby elephant.
[273:25.02]I mean, that's cute.
[273:26.72]I don't know if it's a perfect frame, but it's pretty good.
[273:39.05]It said get a cute one.
[273:41.92]It's running towards life.
[273:53.39]That's so bad.
[273:54.25]That's so bad.
[274:01.06]Oh yeah, go up in a tree.
[274:02.46]And really, have you seen this one yet?
[274:03.96]I mean, come on.
[274:15.81]You even got like the smoke on his legs.
[274:19.35]Just disturbing.
[274:20.83]Disturbing nature.
[274:22.03]Not even remotely close to what they asked for.
[274:24.61]Alright.
[274:28.03]That's good.
[274:28.67]It's alright.
[274:29.13]There you go in the picture book.
[274:35.16]What?
[274:37.98]That's not an elephant calf.
[274:59.29]Okay, so that was not a... That is absolutely an elephant calf.
[275:04.59]Absolutely.
[275:05.05]There's no way that's not a baby.
[275:16.68]What?
[275:19.46]That doesn't make any sense.
[275:24.16]Okay.
[275:25.82]Which is the good one here?
[275:29.19]Probably this one.
[275:35.76]That was not great, but it's alright, I'll take the money.
[275:42.08]No tusks, it said in the email.
[275:48.29]I thought that was like a criteria for... It's just the fact that it's fucking running away.
[275:53.33]That is so bad.
[275:59.28]We already did this one.
[276:00.09]We already did that one.
[276:01.43]Keep that.
[276:01.83]None of these are good.
[276:17.04]No, no, no.
[276:17.38]Keep this one.
[276:19.48]Keep that one.
[276:21.02]Keep that one.
[276:22.54]Keep this one.
[276:23.16]Keep the terriers.
[276:24.84]Yep, two terriers.
[276:26.46]Keep that one.
[276:28.02]Okay, delete.
[276:33.79]Okay, let's go to camera.
[276:35.87]Anything new with the camera?
[276:40.25]No.
[276:41.49]Same lens.
[276:42.15]I don't have any new lenses or anything.
[276:44.71]I can't really buy one.
[276:48.51]I gotta get this calf, apparently, somehow.
[276:50.45]I don't know what I'm missing here.
[276:54.74]I'm gonna get the... I'm getting the photo storage.
[276:56.76]Yeah.
[276:58.66]Because we need to buy it all so the game knows that I bought everything.
[277:09.20]Play Apex.
[277:11.10]Apex, the... I don't play those kind of games.
[277:19.33]Any new emails?
[277:20.37]No, I need to still get this stupid thing.
[277:26.29]Looking for... Let me look at this account.
[277:28.88]Elephant mother and child.
[277:29.74]You're on an expedition or something after, right?
[277:31.86]Do me a favor.
[277:32.38]Snap a photo of a baby African elephant.
[277:34.74]Give me a really cute one.
[277:36.70]One whose tusks haven't grown in yet.
[277:38.60]That's why this one's at four cameras out of five.
[277:41.24]And it's 40 grand.
[277:42.90]Because it's... You gotta get the right spawn...
[277:52.69]Alright, I'm gonna pee my pants.
[277:53.74]I'll be right back in like 30 minutes.
[277:55.30]I'm just kidding.
[277:55.96]Don't leave.
[277:57.05]Leave if you want.
[277:57.53]You can if you want to.
[277:59.35]But I'll be back in like 2 minutes.
[278:00.27]Gotta pee.
[279:48.85]Thank you.
[281:47.42]Holy shit, they made candied bacon downstairs.
[281:50.60]I gotta get out of here.
[281:51.88]It was delicious.
[281:56.47]Brown sugar.
[281:59.99]Maple.
[282:00.65]Bacon.
[282:02.57]It's unbelievable.
[282:03.39]Alright, what were we doing?
[282:09.03]Oh, the baby elephant thing again, right?
[282:24.26]Let's try it again.
[282:30.44]End of the stream.
[282:31.10]Vacant.
[282:31.44]Not yet.
[282:36.04]Not yet.
[282:36.38]We're good.
[282:38.46]I'm going to keep going because I don't know what the status is going to be tomorrow.
[282:43.03]You know what I mean?
[282:43.49]It's easy to be like, oh, well, you know what?
[282:44.71]Okay.
[282:44.97]It's been like five hours.
[282:46.63]Okay.
[282:47.11]No, I'm seeing.
[282:47.87]No, no, no, no, no.
[282:51.79]This might be the green day of the week.
[282:53.79]I have no idea.
[282:54.49]So I'm just going to keep going.
[282:56.77]I'm having fun.
[283:09.39]Green day of the week, yeah.
[283:12.88]I do it every time.
[283:13.86]It's happened every single time.
[283:18.44]Just cut him down.
[283:20.30]No, no, no, that's bad.
[283:21.14]Leave nature alone.
[283:22.22]Alright, we'll just play a vibe game.
[283:34.71]That's next up.
[283:36.47]That is the next thing that I want to do.
[283:38.59]That's the real... I'm going in.
[283:43.80]A lot of VR shit to do.
[283:51.89]What's the point of Eric?
[283:53.97]I think what the developers were looking for was somebody to take up screen real estate, and that's it.
[284:04.82]Because I guess in that tent, in that camp, if it's just empty, that doesn't feel realistic.
[284:11.61]He's just like a researcher.
[284:12.97]They just put him there.
[284:14.51]He just takes up real estate.
[284:20.41]So what was this?
[284:22.09]A 3.5 out of 10?
[284:22.83]I don't agree with that.
[284:28.29]I would put this... I would give it at least a 5.
[284:29.72]Alright, Baby Elephants, let's go.
[284:40.37]It's a 68 on Metacritic.
[284:44.35]That's probably the exact score I would give this.
[284:49.88]is a 68 maybe I'm willing to put this up to a 70 if and only if this is a very very important detail if the next boss fight is cool the cheetah was interesting but whatever this like this area's boss in quotes is if it's cool and fun I might knock it up to a seven zero
[285:20.33]Now I'm gonna search for elephants.
[285:28.25]What are the downsides?
[285:30.09]Uh, driving into any form of a bush or grass stops the carp.
[285:37.19]And... It's a vast, open, sandbox experience.
[285:42.86]It just feels empty.
[286:00.69]No babies, though.
[286:05.70]Are you playing this game still?
[286:07.90]Yeah!
[286:10.72]I actually, this is fun.
[286:12.98]It might not be a good game, but it's fun, and it's rare.
[286:18.47]So, come on.
[286:19.57]That gives it a few points.
[286:21.31]The fact that it's rare.
[286:24.25]And... Your... Your good friend Jeremy spent $50 on this game.
[286:32.58]So I'm gonna get a $50 experience.
[286:42.60]No, I need more elephants.
[286:43.50]How am I supposed to find this shit?
[286:46.82]That baby has tusks.
[286:57.72]You just use an emulator.
[286:58.88]Use a PlayStation 3 emulator.
[287:03.20]Alright.
[287:03.84]As somebody that's tried to do emulators for last generation, it's not there yet.
[287:13.71]There are a handful of games that really truly work as intended on like a PS3 emulator.
[287:33.58]Let me see any elephants.
[287:37.76]And something tells me, and this might just be a hunch here, that the Safari Photography, the Safari Photograph video game, Africa, is not high on the list to get it to work well with an emulator.
[287:56.97]I would probably say that's an accurate statement.
[288:07.49]Where are the elephants?
[288:12.58]God damn it.
[288:13.16]Alright, huge pack of elephants.
[288:14.28]Come on.
[288:16.48]Where are the babies?
[288:20.72]Why do I have to be on the rare quest?
[288:25.52]You have tusks.
[288:27.76]Yes, I know what those are.
[288:30.51]I know where they are.
[288:31.17]Leave me alone.
[288:35.33]You also have tusks.
[288:39.91]Am I even supposed to climb a tree for this one?
[288:42.71]Yeah, but am I just going to climb a tree and wait for elephants to walk by the tree?
[288:45.93]You know how long that's going to take?
[288:59.94]Get out of the way.
[289:00.90]Come on.
[289:01.20]No choice.
[289:01.66]Can I climb this one?
[289:09.22]Elephants are attracted to people in trees.
[289:18.25]And plus, another thing about emulators, uh, that I'm- I'm not entirely sure everybody is aware of this, are they're illegal.
[289:27.85]Like, as like a streamer, as somebody who is broadcasting themself to the internet, Hey guys, like, I don't own this shit, I just downloaded it online for free.
[289:39.69]It's kind of just inviting.
[289:44.70]An issue, potentially.
[289:45.56]Yeah, emulators aren't, but ROMs can be.
[289:52.64]There's a lot of weird... There's a lot of weird slippery legislature with emulating video games.
[290:11.55]So let's say for instance, let's say I got a RCS, PS3, whatever it is.
[290:18.24]Let's say I got that emulator and I downloaded this game and I don't own it.
[290:23.79]Let's say I just streamed this game on an emulator without buying or owning the game.
[290:28.19]You're not supposed to do that.
[290:38.15]But I do own it.
[290:38.93]Yeah, but why would I emulate this now?
[290:43.85]There's no reason for me to emulate this game.
[290:45.49]Do we have a stray baby elephant with no tusks for no reason?
[290:51.23]What?
[290:58.89]No, it has tusks.
[291:00.14]What are you doing out here?
[291:12.11]Now, you could also argue... Like, for instance, if a game is actually not even viable... Like, straight up, you can't get it anywhere... Then, alright, maybe it's... How else are you going to play it, right?
[291:37.18]Emulation and ROMs are actually...
[291:41.13]What they're doing is they're backing up the history of video games.
[291:47.19]As you saw recently, all this shit with the Wii Shop channel, and, you know, games going into abandonware, you can't... Oh, it's like this random Super Nintendo game that you will never see, you will never play, you will never find ever again.
[291:59.64]There are no copies that are in circulation to come.
[292:03.03]You can argue that there's a reason to have backups of video games forever.
[292:16.00]But if I have the means to do it... And I've tried doing emulation before.
[292:22.74]And it just always had, like, some random problem that was like, oh, well, that's good, it's the emulator.
[292:27.27]It's like, well, fuck, okay, well, why don't I just get the damn thing for real?
[292:31.07]And not have to worry about any potential issues that pop up from emulating, like, a last generation game.
[292:36.33]Is that a baby up there?
[292:42.75]And there's even a list online of PS3 emulated games and how much they function.
[292:51.78]It's like, oh, this one, like, kind of works.
[292:53.58]This one doesn't work.
[292:54.70]This one doesn't work at all.
[292:55.60]This one, like, loads past level four.
[292:59.56]Like, you can actually see which ones are even being, like, worked on to help, you know.
[293:04.07]What are you doing out here?
[293:14.16]That's the one that I chased away.
[293:15.48]Well... Why... How am I supposed to do this?
[293:22.45]If... At any given moment... If one or two... Troops of elephants spawn... And all of them have tusks... What is the... How am I supposed to find them?
[293:44.30]What are your thoughts on games being forcibly removed due to licensing issues, like the Scott Pilgrim game on PS3?
[294:13.03]I don't know.
[294:13.33]I'm kind of of the opinion that if you fucking made something and you've released it and people bought it and you sold it, are you really going to be upset that people want to buy it and still play it and resell it?
[294:26.38]It's like, you already did it.
[294:31.11]Here comes another trip.
[294:41.47]Yeah, just stay in the car, Eric.
[294:42.97]Everything will be fine.
[294:44.48]Tusks?
[294:46.36]Put this down.
[294:46.86]Put binoculars and more.
[294:50.78]Can I please get a baby with no tusks?
[294:52.98]You have tusks.
[295:01.02]Did I actually hit the wall in this game?
[295:02.82]I may have... Is this the softlock mission?
[295:19.76]Find two elephants having sex and then follow them for nine months.
[295:31.48]This is the boss battle?
[295:32.58]No, it wouldn't have like a cool cutscene.
[295:37.91]Nine months?
[295:45.62]Wait, hold on.
[295:46.40]A baby... an elephant is pregnant for 22 months?
[295:53.36]That... that's... oh my god!
[296:00.45]Almost two years of pregnancy.
[296:05.06]Humans come out too early.
[296:14.48]Yeah, they are massive when they come up.
[296:15.98]Yeah, that's true.
[296:16.76]Alright, can I, like, cheat this game and put cheat codes in?
[296:27.87]And just skip this one?
[296:31.11]Maybe I have to get in a tree.
[296:34.75]Maybe that's part of it.
[296:35.75]Maybe I have to trigger the cutscene.
[296:48.11]Let me look at this one more time.
[296:49.09]Does this have any info on it for me?
[296:54.48]Client Ireeno showing African elephant calf.
[297:08.34]You cheated enough for one screen.
[297:14.01]What do you mean?
[297:16.23]Cheated?
[297:28.05]I'm gonna get in this and see if I trigger a cutscene or something.
[297:30.57]Because it did say that I could get up.
[297:41.42]Snap a baby elephant.
[297:45.76]Give me a cutscene.
[297:52.25]Oh god damn it, there's a fucking cutscene.
[297:54.07]I can't believe it.
[297:54.69]I've been driving around in circles for like 30, 40 minutes.
[298:01.36]Look, there's a calf in the elephant herd!
[298:03.56]I took the wrong photos.
[298:04.79]Oh, there it is!
[298:05.59]There's the one with no tusks.
[298:13.83]Descripted... Descripted event.
[298:16.45]Good.
[298:20.13]This is the boss.
[298:21.26]Parent and child African elephant.
[298:24.08]Which one's the parent?
[298:40.11]Not bad.
[298:44.88]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[298:45.60]I don't like this one.
[298:46.22]I don't like this.
[298:46.58]I don't like this.
[298:46.96]Change it, change it, change it, change it, change it, change it.
[298:50.72]Manual.
[299:36.46]Get out of the shot, out of the shot, go!
[300:23.41]Bye.
[300:26.07]Let's see what my best photo was.
[300:43.64]I just kind of want one.
[300:51.08]Are elephants... Could you have an elephant as a pet?
[300:56.08]If you had a huge backyard.
[301:02.28]And you put up, like, T-Rex fences.
[301:06.08]I'm talking, you own, like, 40 acres.
[301:09.32]Like, 50 acres of land.
[301:10.84]100 acres of land.
[301:11.32]And you have man-made pools and man-made shrubbery and bushes and shit.
[301:24.03]Which one's the good one?
[301:24.83]The black and... No, it's not!
[301:29.97]The last black and white photo I took was way better than all these.
[301:32.62]Really care for the young.
[301:42.27]Well, how did it go?
[301:43.05]Did you get your photos of the baby elephant?
[301:45.21]I did.
[301:52.65]Yeah, you have like 100 acres of land.
[301:53.95]You have walls surrounding the whole thing.
[301:58.01]And you have one giant elephant.
[302:05.29]Yeah, and like some of you guys said, you could have another part of land.
[302:08.68]Let's say you own 100 acres.
[302:09.70]Like 10 acres could be for elephants.
[302:12.06]Like 5, 10 acres could be for bears.
[302:14.98]Get a couple of bears.
[302:16.02]Make sure they're all fenced off completely.
[302:19.40]Maybe have like a penguin exhibit too, like get ice shipped in, like 50 acres or something.
[302:36.29]Who's gonna clean it?
[302:37.54]You can hire a staff.
[302:38.42]You know, if you have that kind of money to have an elephant for a pet, you probably have money to spend.
[302:43.60]So you can hire like a hundred people, a hundred staff to take care of the animals.
[302:50.88]And then maybe have a little area that's small, like a building that you develop that has stuffed animals in it of the animals that are there.
[303:02.59]And coloring books and shit.
[303:04.63]And then you could invite people over to come and hang out.
[303:22.48]I love how much people hate this.
[303:33.35]And yeah, yeah, you can charge.
[303:35.01]Just, you know, to cover the costs of, you know, you have like pet elephants and pet bears and shit.
[303:39.41]Like $20 to come and look around.
[303:40.99]Alright.
[303:49.36]Um, I don't know how this one...
[303:57.26]The composition of this one is not... This one is way better.
[303:59.72]Look at the depth of field on this one.
[304:02.97]This one's like five times better.
[304:04.83]This is really the best algorithm... algorithm...
[304:25.73]It's because of the... mother pushing up.
[304:29.65]I guess.
[304:39.72]Well, that's apparently the best one, so I'm gonna listen to the game.
[304:46.11]Accidental black and white photo?
[304:49.11]Accident- no, I turned it on... I did that intentionally.
[304:55.85]That's a lot of money.
[305:00.88]How could the angle not be better than that?
[305:03.44]Considering they told me to go in this tree.
[305:05.46]This was a cutscene.
[305:08.56]I got cutscened into this angle and it was a bad angle.
[305:12.28]That's not my fault.
[305:22.19]Another job done.
[305:22.85]We're still on one piece.
[305:23.95]Tomorrow we start early.
[305:24.79]Let's get some rest.
[305:33.87]He was supposed to be on top of the elephant.
[305:37.57]Good morning, Francine.
[305:38.45]Be sure to check your email.
[305:45.81]Sending map new area.
[305:47.08]Alright.
[305:48.28]I think this might be one of the last areas.
[305:52.74]New camera.
[305:55.28]Thank you for your continued business.
[305:56.56]In today's newsletter, we'd like to let our A100 users know the product they've been waiting for has finally arrived.
[306:03.06]The 24-105mm f-stop of 3.5-4.5 is an interchangeable lens for the A series.
[306:11.24]Switch lenses and power up your photography.
[306:13.37]This is a pro shot for more details.
[306:20.61]We got a new area.
[306:22.89]The Choroa Gorge.
[306:27.06]Harsh lands surrounded by rocks and sand.
[306:28.74]Let's research the area.
[306:36.83]I'm gonna get an ad.
[306:39.12]We're actually getting a fucking ad.
[306:52.51]Clever.
[306:52.81]Alright, well there it is.
[306:56.68]Wide angle to mid-range telephoto.
[307:03.27]Let's do it.
[307:04.78]Compact.
[307:05.38]High power standard.
[307:06.42]Zoom.
[307:07.78]Wide angle.
[307:08.40]Beautiful.
[307:15.37]This whole game is really just product placement.
[307:25.77]This money goes back in the day here.
[307:26.94]2007, 2008.
[307:31.04]Like, how desperate are you, Sony?
[307:32.40]Canon was the leader here.
[307:38.09]Alright, so this is a telephoto.
[307:41.37]We're gonna get some cool photographs with this one.
[307:44.15]Is Canon still the leader?
[307:50.92]Wouldn't surprise me at all.
[307:51.78]They make high quality fucking cameras.
[307:58.98]I still haven't used this at all.
[308:09.82]This is the next level sponsored stream.
[308:13.33]Play a game that has a competitor advertising all over the place and have streamer talk about how dumb it is and bad it is.
[308:20.33]And then mention canon once and subliminally, subliminally get that message inside of the consumer's head.
[308:29.41]I'm having trouble with words tonight.
[308:30.55]I don't know why.
[308:31.27]Uh, that one's better, so I'm gonna get rid of these.
[308:41.34]No, keep these.
[308:47.34]I have to have a bunch of memories from each encounter.
[308:49.64]Alright, let's go explore the new area.
[308:58.66]All DSLRs are the same.
[309:02.12]No, Canon is definitely still, you know, they're still the best.
[309:10.20]What do they got now?
[309:15.18]Didn't Kodak literally go bankrupt?
[309:20.94]Did they?
[309:27.04]Canon's not worth the money.
[309:32.17]It's Nikon now.
[309:36.51]Nikon's the best now?
[309:37.37]Nikon's doing well.
[309:48.94]I mean, Nikon's doing well in the... I mean, Nikon's doing alright in the consumer level.
[310:00.98]You know, you buy the Nikon T-2000 series and you bring it on vacation and take nice pictures.
[310:10.47]You know, you bring that to Vegas and you take a picture of Excalibur, the hotel, and you're like, oh, that was good.
[310:16.81]That was worth, you know, like in the consumer, like $280, like kind of nice consumer level.
[310:40.81]You know, but I find Sony to be the best for photography.
[310:44.92]Photog... Photographing.
[310:47.72]Holy shit, Jeremy.
[310:49.78]Get your fucking head screwed on.
[310:52.14]Photographing.
[310:53.92]What's wrong with me tonight?
[310:57.45]I'll tell you, the high winds must have blown my brain around in my skull.
[311:05.07]It was crazy, though, let me tell you.
[311:06.43]Etalyx and I were outside, just securing shit, because the wind can cause damage, we're making sure we don't lose stuff that can fly around and around the house.
[311:17.47]Yeah, around outside the house and all that shit.
[311:20.14]This was like a movie.
[311:21.12]This was like being on set in a fucking tornado-themed movie.
[311:24.36]It was terrifying.
[311:29.80]It was at the point where you had to lean into the wind or you were going to fall over.
[311:35.46]Plant your feet and stuff your back into the huge 60 fucking mile per hour gust or you're going down.
[311:41.88]It was crazy.
[311:54.33]Close your mouth or your dentures will fly out.
[311:59.99]Open your mouth for a second.
[312:03.61]You can see it just skyrocket over the horizon.
[312:08.37]Is this the new zone?
[312:09.46]This is not the new zone.
[312:10.20]Why do you have to drive so slow through the new area?
[312:17.74]Las Vegas doesn't ever get that type of weather, does it?
[312:21.52]From my understanding... Not the rain.
[312:25.38]The rain is something that doesn't happen very often.
[312:27.08]So we got a shitload of rain.
[312:29.82]uh I think like they actually it actually broke a record yesterday with the most rain ever in one day on Valentine's at least on Valentine's day I broke a record somehow uh but the wind from my understanding is it happens a lot Vegas is a very windy city but being here for about four and a half months
[312:56.50]we've never experienced that more than like 60 plus mile per hour wind gusts so it does get windy around here but it can get pretty extreme sometimes I don't know where the hell it comes from
[313:31.80]I actually kind of like that picture.
[313:38.52]I really like this.
[313:43.28]Can you run over animals?
[313:44.15]You cannot run over animals.
[313:50.03]Is the minimum changed yet?
[313:51.35]Uh, not yet.
[313:53.45]The minimum is changing over the next couple of days though.
[313:56.41]So just to make sure you're aware.
[313:59.78]The bit minimum is increasing to 250.
[314:01.40]250 is the new bit reading minimum.
[314:12.08]As of, like, now.
[314:14.06]But not as of this stream.
[314:17.74]If that makes any sense.
[314:19.23]So, like, in the next few streams, we're going to slowly kind of transition it.
[314:27.14]I did bring it down from three because the some of the things that people were saying there were some good points about how buying bits makes a three dollar minimum sort of awkward because they don't come in threes they come in fives right
[314:47.05]How do you slowly transition that?
[314:48.31]Well, it happens instantly over one day.
[314:50.87]But, uh, over the course of the last three weeks or so, almost about a month, I've been slowly telling everybody that it's going to happen in mid-February.
[314:59.30]So, I mean, I have slowly been telling everybody it was going to happen in mid-February, and now we're in mid-February.
[315:04.96]It's going to take one day.
[315:09.12]Are there ostriches here?
[315:16.28]There are ostriches in Africa?
[315:21.84]I thought these were like only in New Zealand.
[315:29.64]Isn't this like the New Zealand state bird?
[315:32.67]That's a good photo.
[315:41.79]That's emus.
[315:48.66]Oh wait!
[315:55.01]Let's put it on out of now.
[316:01.76]No!
[316:02.00]Get the fucking black and white off!
[316:19.37]Well, let's start surveying from this location.
[316:21.85]Francine, why don't you take the wheel?
[316:23.25]Wow, there's an actual camera emulator.
[316:30.03]Yeah.
[316:32.41]It has all the settings.
[316:34.65]That's why this game is really... Can I just drop this guy off?
[316:40.53]You actually don't have a reason to be here.
[316:42.09]Let me get out and get a good picture of this.
[316:43.51]Never mind.
[316:43.89]Let's go.
[316:53.29]That guy's just back there smoking a blunt.
[316:59.63]Okay, slow down.
[317:00.99]Let me get a good one.
[317:01.57]This is a good horizon here.
[317:04.21]Ooh.
[317:07.86]No, you're ruining the shot.
[317:08.66]Get out of the way.
[317:21.52]Nice.
[317:23.50]Nice.
[317:24.12]Oh, you're getting close.
[317:36.79]Oh, work with me here.
[317:37.81]Work with me here.
[317:38.65]Look at this one.
[317:40.53]Whoa.
[317:41.65]I love it.
[317:42.31]I love it.
[317:42.71]I hope you just get out of the way.
[317:44.57]I gotta get a little tighter.
[317:45.33]I don't want that little deer in the way.
[317:47.75]Come on, come on, come on.
[317:48.49]This is like a fucking car commercial.
[317:49.73]Do it, do it, do it.
[318:07.71]He's using the rule of thirds!
[318:16.88]I like that one.
[318:28.55]There's nothing wrong with this photo.
[318:30.47]Why is that such a bad thing?
[318:43.24]That one's really good too.
[318:44.92]That one actually might be the best one.
[318:51.22]Why a... not a different shutter?
[318:54.30]Well, because I want my photos to look awful.
[319:06.71]Make... Yeah, I can make one of these my desktop background.
[319:13.08]Oh, that's some pretty good photos.
[319:14.10]I like the landscape here.
[319:19.57]This is Kubwa Rock.
[319:23.99]Put your ISO at 12,000.
[319:32.34]Any more wildlife?
[319:33.86]Probably rhinos here.
[319:34.68]I need to get a good picture of Oscar.
[319:36.80]Alright, we got something else over here.
[319:42.83]What's this?
[319:46.53]Where are the lions?
[319:48.06]This has got to be the lion zone.
[319:49.56]It has to be.
[320:09.13]One of those will be good enough.
[320:15.06]Let's do a real slow, slow fucking shotter.
[320:31.51]Something, like, terrible.
[320:52.30]Stop moving.
[320:57.96]It's too bright.
[320:58.94]No, get out of the menu.
[321:02.40]I gotta... Okay.
[321:03.83]Manual.
[321:14.35]No, it's the other direction.
[321:15.80]You gotta go up.
[321:16.76]You gotta close the iris, not open it.
[321:46.02]More than that.
[322:10.11]Pretty good.
[322:15.85]Stay right there.
[322:16.38]Right there.
[322:16.68]Right there.
[322:16.96]Stay, stay, stay, stay.
[322:17.78]Right there.
[322:18.22]Right there.
[322:18.56]There it is.
[322:18.96]Stay there.
[322:21.14]Right there.
[322:30.52]Look at that.
[322:30.94]That was fucking beautiful.
[322:32.73]No, I moved.
[322:36.09]No, no, no, no, no.
[322:37.11]It's just Shudder.
[322:37.65]The Shudder I had to... That was perfect.
[322:39.19]The Shudder has got to be quicker than that.
[322:42.40]Oh, he walked by at the right time.
[322:43.58]Don't move.
[322:51.28]Walk into frame.
[322:52.12]Come on.
[322:55.37]Walk into frame so I can get the good depth of field here.
[322:59.65]I'll follow you as long as I need to.
[323:12.98]I'll get it.
[323:14.35]It's gonna be a good one.
[323:15.13]Watch this.
[323:18.35]Ah, if I was only a little bit.
[323:20.21]Come on.
[323:24.21]I need you, like, down here.
[323:25.65]I gotta move.
[323:33.88]Opportunity is knocking right now.
[323:39.93]You dumb dickhead.
[324:01.06]That was what I wanted This one's not bad, I don't mind this one Yeah, this is the we finally got the I got the right exposure here Whoops
[324:34.20]Can you imagine... If it was a little turn the other way, but can you imagine how good this one would have been?
[324:39.74]It's still alright.
[324:41.61]Man, if I could have gone... I need a bigger lens.
[324:43.49]I want to go closer.
[324:44.41]Go right up in his face.
[324:47.73]But I can't do that.
[325:08.49]Fuck, I need a better shutter.
[325:10.94]No, every one of your fucking dumb inputs are wrong.
[325:49.95]I need to get a better lens.
[325:51.53]Can I just buy one?
[325:58.44]No live preview when adjusting the settings.
[326:00.90]Yeah, that's the one unfortunate thing.
[326:02.08]You only get the pre... It shows you what you got.
[326:05.36]Actually, hold on a minute there.
[326:06.82]All of you stay right there.
[326:10.73]I can get in front.
[326:15.49]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[326:16.69]Shh.
[326:35.83]God.
[327:03.97]the fucking tree here.
[327:04.84]Come on.
[327:06.22]I need a tree right here.
[327:45.38]It's alright.
[327:45.98]Close enough.
[328:01.22]Okay, that's what I want.
[328:02.48]I want that- I want it to be a little darker.
[328:03.84]I don't want it, like, blown out.
[328:10.70]I need one of them to go through that tree.
[328:15.83]I need to get up here.
[328:16.59]Alright.
[328:19.35]Master plan.
[328:19.89]Come on.
[328:21.23]What I want is... I want... I want one of you to go through here.
[328:26.95]Like that.
[328:27.73]And I get you right in the middle.
[328:29.55]I gotta go a little closer.
[328:42.78]Oh, fuck it.
[328:43.30]Whatever.
[328:43.54]I'm taking this too seriously.
[328:44.62]This is fun.
[328:47.98]Got another bird.
[328:53.94]Press R3.
[328:54.78]It drops bait for the animal.
[328:57.70]Add that to a list of bullshit things I've heard in the last two days.
[329:14.21]Can I have him take the wheel so I can take a photo?
[329:24.44]Guys, don't you know that a photographer will take, like, 2,000 photos at an event or something they're hired for, and only, like, four of them are gonna get used?
[329:49.36]Ooh, it's fast!
[329:56.81]I gotta see that one.
[330:03.93]Oh, if only it was a little bit more.
[330:06.47]Oh, you're coming right at me.
[330:07.29]I got a chance.
[330:12.54]What are you doing?
[330:14.12]Wow, meerkats!
[330:16.72]That's the first piece of dialogue you've had in four days, Eric.
[330:19.72]Shut up.
[330:27.01]Putting the camera right in there.
[332:03.10]I'm trying so hard to not make any noise.
[332:04.76]I'm hopping right now.
[332:06.54]What are you doing?
[332:09.42]Nobody walks like that.
[332:11.86]Nice stealth walk.
[332:14.96]Look at how majestic this bird is.
[332:19.40]No, I got to get closer than this.
[332:26.59]What's with you?
[332:54.54]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[332:59.34]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[333:01.46]No!
[333:17.39]Shit, you ruined the photo!
[333:19.27]You dick!
[333:24.10]That's a pretty good class picture.
[333:28.55]OK, I'm gone.
[333:36.21]That was really weird.
[333:37.19]OK.
[333:37.31]What was I doing?
[333:38.93]Oh, yeah, meerkats.
[333:50.97]That's a good one.
[333:52.77]Perfect straight line.
[333:54.53]Right in the middle.
[333:55.83]Alright, I gotta go to the meerkats.
[334:05.22]What hole are they in?
[334:05.84]Do I have to- I'm just gonna hide.
[334:06.84]Maybe I shouldn't park the Jeep in front of the holes.
[334:23.84]That's good.
[334:26.68]So let's wait.
[334:27.28]I'm going to put the binoculars out.
[334:28.32]Let me get a good spot.
[334:29.42]Is there a tree I can climb or something?
[334:30.82]What about up here?
[334:31.36]Can I get up there?
[334:39.05]No, that's a wall.
[334:40.17]It's an actual wall that I can't climb.
[334:42.09]Why can't I just stand on the Jeep?
[334:44.41]That seems like a perfectly, perfectly swell place to stand.
[335:01.75]Damn it.
[335:04.65]Just park the Jeep over the holes.
[335:07.23]What kind of monster are you?
[335:11.33]No, I'm just gonna sit here.
[335:13.27]I'm gonna wait till one shows their head, and I'm gonna whip the camera out and snap.
[335:30.94]They pop up, right?
[335:31.80]When are they gonna show up?
[335:47.86]Come on!
[335:50.19]Are they just holes?
[335:55.23]Just look for other holes.
[335:57.09]Maybe, I...
[336:01.08]Alright, we're gonna look for other holes.
[336:05.06]The giraffes.
[336:19.44]Don't run across!
[336:20.30]Don't run across!
[336:20.98]What are you doing?
[336:21.74]Can you break the truck?
[336:27.18]You cannot, unfortunately.
[336:28.80]I wish you could.
[336:32.21]That would have definitely caused some damage.
[336:35.99]This is the kobe sand.
[336:39.91]Some other type of animal here.
[336:47.01]Tigers?
[336:47.67]Lions?
[336:48.31]There's gotta be a lion in this game.
[336:52.14]You can't have it take photos of animals game and not have a lion in this area.
[336:57.82]There's no way.
[337:02.46]Can I climb this tree?
[337:14.18]It's a pretty good view, but there's nothing here.
[337:15.50]What the hell is that?
[337:20.87]No, it's just a random animal.
[337:23.35]Is it a bird?
[337:26.45]What kind of bird is that?
[337:29.63]Is it like a pheasant?
[337:34.35]That is the equivalent of a bird chadwalk.
[337:41.02]It's gold, too.
[337:41.94]We gotta get a picture of the golden bird.
[338:04.79]Oh, it's just a dumb vulture.
[338:06.21]Okay.
[338:11.58]What's supposed to be over here?
[338:14.82]Well, I didn't get the meerkat, but let's go back and turn some of these in.
[338:27.28]The meerkat's too scared to come out of their burrow.
[338:29.18]There must be a way.
[338:29.98]Let's request new equipment from the head office.
[338:31.84]I couldn't do anything.
[338:35.40]Give me a break.
[338:44.57]I took a lot of pictures, didn't I?
[338:45.81]Alright, we got our email.
[338:50.09]We're going to do wildlife research.
[338:51.78]Any new animals?
[338:52.46]We have a few.
[338:54.22]What's a good one?
[338:57.90]Alright.
[339:00.30]Golden vulture.
[339:08.56]It's apparently one of the... Why are the bird pictures with bad framing the most highly sought after images?
[339:23.83]We got the good class picture of the ostrich.
[339:31.45]This has got to be a full block for everything, right?
[339:34.55]God damn it.
[339:35.47]Distance.
[339:37.09]By a hair.
[339:38.61]And technique by a hair.
[339:41.43]Damn it.
[339:42.33]Oh well.
[339:51.24]Okay, let's see.
[339:52.28]This is the photobomb.
[339:52.98]I'm going to keep that one.
[339:54.68]This one sucks.
[339:56.99]This one's kind of cool, but sucks.
[339:59.88]I don't know what this picture is of.
[340:01.58]I was trying to go for some artsy bullshit where everything in the foreground was out of focus and they were in focus but my subject was not cooperating.
[340:17.73]That one's not bad.
[340:22.41]I like this one.
[340:30.13]That one's good.
[340:31.11]This one's fine.
[340:32.11]That's a good one.
[340:49.20]Okay.
[340:53.40]That one causes a headache.
[341:00.88]I'm progressively trying to change the aperture and the shutter.
[341:07.64]See, typically, you know, you go through and you delete all these.
[341:13.09]Slowly gets better, and then you got the fucking money shot, which is right here.
[341:17.67]Right here.
[341:18.07]This one actually is more pleasing to me.
[341:25.25]Let them evaluate this one?
[341:26.63]No.
[341:30.71]Is that the same bird?
[341:31.63]It is.
[341:34.41]That's pretty... That's pretty great.
[341:37.53]Can't you just see a logo right in the middle there?
[341:41.98]That's perfect template for two or three words for your business.
[341:47.28]I think there's a better one, too.
[341:59.95]That's pretty good.
[342:01.86]I think that works for what they're looking for.
[342:03.10]Come on, give me a perfect.
[342:11.23]God damn it.
[342:16.52]And then there was one more photo of an animal.
[342:20.90]Where is it?
[342:24.44]No, not the baby running away scared.
[342:28.70]Maybe that's it.
[342:30.54]No, that's it.
[342:31.06]Okay.
[342:31.54]Let's, uh... Yeah, cancel this out.
[342:37.41]Let's delete some of these.
[342:38.33]Alright, uh, these are terrible.
[342:41.77]I like the both of these.
[342:43.15]I'm gonna keep them both.
[342:44.73]This one's dumb.
[342:45.55]Don't like it.
[342:46.07]Don't want any of these.
[342:46.91]This one's okay, but not worth saving.
[342:50.29]None of these are worth saving.
[342:52.21]None of these are worth saving.
[342:54.77]It's just a shitty, it's just a job, you know what I mean?
[342:58.01]No, don't get rid of the advertising template.
[343:04.72]But here's the, I mean, advertising template, marketing template.
[343:09.60]What's, I mean, it's good to have two templates because this giraffe is paying attention to whatever the company or logo is in the middle of the screen.
[343:18.68]This giraffe is paying attention to you, cares about you and your interests.
[343:24.11]So the logo on the screen is there for the company, but this giraffe is endorsing it and looking to you on how you feel about it instead of what the giraffe feels about the company.
[343:39.85]I'll keep them both.
[343:48.03]I'll get rid of this one.
[343:49.96]Keep that one.
[343:57.44]I'm gonna run out of space.
[343:58.20]I need more space.
[344:03.07]Keep that one.
[344:03.47]Okay, delete.
[344:07.77]I'm assuming we're probably gonna get, uh... a mission.
[344:16.82]But the giraffe could also symbolize a person targeted by the advertisement, so the one with it looking at the logo would be better.
[344:23.26]Could be.
[344:25.43]That's all on the marketing firm that decides to pay for those pictures.
[344:30.23]I'm just the photographer.
[344:32.75]They interpret, not me.
[344:34.39]Well, there's a lot here.
[344:37.98]Thanks for the other day.
[344:41.04]Amazing Animals editorial desk.
[344:42.46]My boss loved the giraffe photo.
[344:44.08]Thanks for saving my bacon.
[344:46.38]Hey, by the way, have you ever seen ostriches court each other?
[344:50.19]If not, you should check it out.
[344:51.34]It's quite a spectacle.
[344:52.94]And by check it out, I mean snap me a photo.
[344:55.14]I'll use it in next month's Amazing Animals.
[345:05.29]Sure.
[345:06.95]Cute little animal request.
[345:10.29]One of the companies sponsoring our project requested you send a photo of a meerkat standing up and looking around.
[345:16.60]However, you won't find a more vigilant watchman than a meerkat.
[345:19.89]You'll have a rough time sneaking up on one without being noticed.
[345:23.75]What was I just eating in that last frame?
[345:25.07]Oh, it's a stick.
[345:27.97]Okay.
[345:29.73]Luckily, we were ready for this and have prepared new equipment for you.
[345:32.67]Use it to get the photo.
[345:35.13]I can't do that now.
[345:35.83]I'm doing the ostriches having sex with each other.
[345:42.33]An animal that has a funny face.
[345:44.97]Hey, can you take a photo for our next issue?
[345:46.59]We're doing a favorite funny animal faces.
[345:49.88]And I want you to put a picture of a heart beast in the running.
[345:53.70]They have those long, slender faces.
[345:55.50]If you got a shot from head on, our readers would vote at number one, no question.
[346:06.18]No, I deleted them all.
[346:07.66]Alright, I gotta get a good one of the funny face.
[346:11.82]Trap cam on its way.
[346:15.02]Head office is sending you new equipment.
[346:16.20]The trap cam lets you photograph subjects remotely.
[346:20.30]Set up the camera where you want to take a photo, then trigger the shutter from a distance.
[346:26.02]Feel free to use the trap cam for other research after you finish taking the meerkat photo.
[346:29.61]Alright.
[346:32.17]Francine ever heard of the Big Five?
[346:33.77]There are five major animals people want to see on safaris.
[346:37.07]The African elephant, the African buffalo, the rhino, the leopard, and the lion.
[346:41.03]They're all tough to find, though.
[346:42.21]You'd have to be pretty lucky to spot them all.
[346:45.90]Oh, there's the rare spawn.
[346:47.60]The lion.
[346:48.06]Alright, uh, ostriches doing courting.
[346:54.95]Okay.
[346:57.17]How do I use?
[346:59.87]The male slowly rotates its wings and moves its head into figure eight.
[347:03.34]It's quite exotic.
[347:05.28]Okay.
[347:08.42]How do I use the trap cam?
[347:14.68]How do I use it?
[347:15.24]Wait a minute.
[347:15.98]I got the wrong camera.
[347:20.18]No, I don't want to do that.
[347:47.75]10 hour Jupiter?
[347:56.37]It's the amateur camera.
[347:57.49]Alright, let's go with ostriches.
[348:01.92]Ostriches.
[348:03.98]It's weird to say that name.
[348:05.44]Ostriches.
[348:09.00]Hard to say.
[348:09.34]Ostrich.
[348:09.52]Ostrich.
[348:33.77]Okay, capture an ostrich in a mating ritual.
[348:39.13]Can't I just skip to the... You can't, you can't sort of base camp up in the other areas.
[349:08.29]GTA bushes.
[349:10.15]Yeah, they're pretty bad.
[349:14.59]So which way is the place we just worked?
[349:19.88]This way?
[349:20.30]Fucking god.
[349:46.92]Do we have a problem in chat?
[349:47.98]Do we have a problem right now in chat?
[349:54.42]Am I getting baited here?
[349:56.17]Or is this actually the day that I get rid of Lynx forever?
[350:02.95]OK.
[350:03.65]Alright.
[350:04.15]That's fine.
[350:04.51]Just remember it.
[350:05.01]The boy who cried wolf.
[350:22.63]Open it!
[350:23.15]I'm not gonna open it!
[350:24.74]I don't wanna open it!
[350:25.88]Don't crash into that, it's gonna stop you.
[350:35.92]Oh, you're testing his patience.
[350:38.04]What is he gonna do?
[350:46.42]Do I really have to go from the wetlands to... through the wetlands?
[350:50.24]Up through the other place.
[350:51.70]Into the desert area.
[351:07.05]Do I actually have to do that?
[351:14.62]Long loading screens.
[351:20.85]Guys, let's act like his camera's on, his cam's on.
[351:28.91]That's not a fake message.
[351:39.06]Somebody actually wrote that.
[351:44.48]What?
[351:49.80]Fuck, I've been baited.
[351:53.83]What the fuck, dude?
[351:57.21]No one said... Yes, they did.
[351:58.23]Check the logs.
[351:59.01]Somebody wrote that.
[351:59.61]Somebody said, let's pretend... Oh, it was in all capitals.
[352:01.91]That's why I turned that on.
[352:08.58]Alright, we need an ostrich mating ritual, which means we gotta go this way.
[352:17.56]No, I guess they didn't.
[352:18.16]Somebody did say that.
[352:20.58]I have the logs.
[352:35.30]Show the logs?
[352:35.96]I'm not gonna show logs.
[352:51.31]I don't even have any logs.
[352:52.21]It was a lie.
[352:56.07]I have a memory.
[352:56.91]Alright, get out.
[352:58.17]Let's see if there's a ritual right here.
[353:05.05]Alright, they moved ahead in the figure eight.
[353:08.85]Like that?
[353:09.25]Is that one going to... That one's about to do it.
[353:13.30]Is this one about to do the thing?
[353:14.78]He turned his head upside down.
[353:17.12]He's going to do the thing.
[353:20.34]He's about to do it.
[353:24.57]I gotta get closer than that.
[353:29.81]It looks like somebody squished his neck.
[353:32.15]Somebody accidentally stepped on his neck.
[353:47.59]No.
[353:58.39]I wonder.
[353:58.81]Alright, you like Donald Duck.
[354:04.78]Go find another Donald Duck.
[354:09.31]And let's get this over with.
[354:33.19]Why are you not taking this moment to make a funny animal documentary?
[354:36.07]I don't know, because that's... What do you want me to say?
[354:44.48]I already did that joke, like, five years ago.
[354:46.92]I have not done an animal... Okay, you want me to go like this.
[355:00.54]Like, as you can see here, the giraffe is drinking from the water.
[355:05.34]And to the left.
[355:06.06]Wait, here it is.
[355:06.64]In action right now.
[355:07.27]Got it.
[355:13.07]There it is.
[355:13.87]It's doing like a turkey dance.
[355:15.09]Alright, that's what I need to get.
[355:16.33]I got it already.
[355:16.85]Like, that's what you guys wanted.
[355:19.29]You don't want that.
[355:35.69]You'll do it again.
[355:41.37]So, is this game any fun, or is this whole stream just a bit?
[355:48.41]That'd be pretty long.
[355:49.59]That'd be six straight hours.
[355:52.99]Of a bit.
[355:58.91]That's the whole stream.
[356:00.71]Been a bit.
[356:01.87]I got it.
[356:02.51]Who cares if it's not worth anything?
[356:11.14]You can't even see it.
[356:12.68]It's a very bad photo.
[356:14.66]This one's about to do it, right?
[356:16.40]They get down on their knees and they start moving around in a circle.
[356:20.86]They flow their feathers out and they start moving their head around.
[356:22.85]I gotta get in front of them.
[356:36.69]Have I tried only talking when I have something funny to say?
[356:41.48]Uh... Why the hell would I do that?
[356:49.33]If I were to just sit here silently, it would just be... You'd be watching a silent gameplay of PlayStation 3 Safari photos.
[357:02.36]Why in the name of fucking God would I ever do that?
[357:15.44]Alright, I'll try it.
[357:16.18]Yeah, I'll make it really...
[358:08.07]This is not a joke.
[358:09.05]Hey, what's up, guys?
[358:09.87]Chiming in here.
[358:11.03]This is not a joke.
[358:11.73]It's just, did you guys actually know that the ostrich is one of the most closely related animals to dinosaurs?
[358:20.96]That just quickly...
[359:02.04]If I were to walk in my room right now, and not- I wasn't streaming this.
[359:07.40]This is a really weird fucking game just to be playing, just here.
[359:11.54]Somebody just walk- I mean, I know it's not funny, but it is.
[359:17.43]Silently playing this game?
[359:20.59]I mean, it's- It feels weird to play this game in silence.
[359:32.63]It just does.
[359:33.43]I'm sorry.
[359:35.59]I ain't gonna... You're not gonna silence me.
[359:49.38]It's immersing.
[359:51.28]Fine.
[359:51.94]Five straight minutes of silence.
[359:53.62]I...
[363:31.35]I got something funny to say.
[363:32.23]That's a workout video.
[363:33.81]That's a workout video, and I just got a picture of a workout video.
[363:38.11]That's funny.
[363:55.66]I got it.
[363:58.26]Five moments.
[363:58.92]I can't fucking do it.
[364:04.01]I only have third, but that was, how was it, I'm not gonna say that?
[364:06.37]Alright, I can fucking do it, I'm doing it, and I'm not, I don't care if there's anything funny to say, I'm not gonna say anything, I swear to god.
[364:15.78]Five fucking minutes, I'm not gonna talk, I'm not gonna smirk, staring at the fucking screen, playing my silent video game.
[364:22.42]I'm gonna keep the mic on this time so I can prove it.
[364:24.29]Okay.
[364:34.26]Here he goes, here he goes, here he goes, here he goes.
[364:35.66]No, shut up.
[364:36.44]I already blew it.
[364:37.10]It's already over.
[364:38.55]Start again, right now.
[364:39.79]Go.
[364:41.69]I already got the... I gotta get in front of him.
[364:49.28]Shh.
[364:49.74]Okay, starting now.
[366:05.18]Nothing was even fucking funny.
[366:16.14]I just, I started rifling through things in my head that were funny.
[366:19.78]I don't know why my brain was trying to make me lose.
[366:23.39]My brain was desperate.
[366:24.35]It's like, you know when you're like in class and the teacher's like, everybody shut the fuck up.
[366:29.65]Any more peeps at all and that's it.
[366:31.61]You're gonna have detention.
[366:33.55]And you shut the fuck up and you're like, I don't want to get in trouble.
[366:35.25]And then you think of every funny thing you've ever heard of in your life.
[366:38.79]Your brain just starts to talk, things that have nothing to do with what you just heard, what might have been funny five minutes ago.
[366:43.52]You talk about like shit that was, like you fell off your skateboard and like you like bumped your head on a wall or something in the ninth grade and it was like hilarious.
[366:52.56]Or like somebody puked in front of you when you were like fucking 14 and you were like laughing your ass off.
[366:57.02]Those images come into your mind.
[366:58.48]That just happened.
[367:07.63]I'm gonna get it.
[367:08.17]I'm gonna get it.
[367:09.05]Let's go.
[367:09.47]Three, two, one, go.
[367:16.65]What?
[367:17.03]No, I'm talking about like if I like... You ever like bumped into something and like you knocked over like a fucking cabinet and it's not funny?
[367:32.47]Yeah, a whole cabinet.
[367:49.15]I'm sorry, guys, but in eighth grade typing class, somebody puking on their computer all over the keys.
[367:57.74]How would you react to that?
[368:18.64]But that didn't even happen to me.
[368:19.60]That happened to my father.
[368:20.56]That's a story from my father.
[368:25.32]My dad, my father did that.
[368:28.56]I wasn't in the classroom.
[368:34.60]He ate like pecan pie and fucking threw up all over his computer.
[368:39.70]Wait, this might have been a lie that my father told me.
[368:43.44]Because they didn't have computers back then, did they?
[368:47.53]Was it computers back in like the fucking 70s?
[368:54.82]He's going for it, he's going for it, he's going for it.
[369:04.39]How bad is the picture that I took?
[369:09.09]It doesn't matter.
[369:09.65]It looks like shit, but who cares.
[369:16.96]Yeah, there was a typing class.
[369:18.54]I'm going to text him tomorrow and be like, hey, did you have a computer?
[369:20.87]Does the pecan pie throw up all over the keyboard story real or did you make that up?
[369:26.11]I'm going to get the whole story.
[369:48.21]I've been here for so long trying to take pictures of these fucking... I was gonna say elves.
[369:55.90]Every funny thing I've ever heard of is happening right now in my brain.
[369:59.44]Everything that I've ever thought was funny is all mashing together into one made-up fucking story.
[370:05.88]I think that's actually what's happening.
[370:19.76]Because I can't shut the fuck up for five minutes.
[370:21.82]Are you going for it?
[370:38.01]It's good practice.
[370:38.73]Okay, I'm gonna try it again.
[370:39.79]This is the real one.
[370:40.72]This one's no more fucking around.
[370:41.76]I swear to God, I promise.
[370:42.88]100% guarantee.
[370:44.48]If I crack, I will give a hundred gift subs if I fucking crack.
[370:50.50]Five minutes starting now, let's go.
[372:28.30]Thank you.
[373:02.52]Thank you.
[374:47.92]I'm fucking fresh!
[375:02.70]God damn it!
[375:10.36]Okay, two things.
[375:12.80]One, the ostriches were walking in exact succession to my lens.
[375:15.88]It got silent and all you heard was
[375:19.66]And then I crashed the same fucking bush that I crashed into like a hundred times.
[375:26.49]How long was that?
[375:37.15]That's four minutes.
[375:57.34]Photo finish.
[376:03.43]How many subs was it?
[376:04.29]50?
[376:04.31]Oh, god damn it.
[376:44.45]I fucking- I had it too, it was fine, I swallowed that bullshit and then I drove into the same fucking bullshit I've driven into every single goddamn time.
[377:00.26]I had it.
[377:00.64]Alright, how do I fucking do this again?
[377:05.97]God damn it.
[377:10.03]Is it 100 subs?
[377:11.67]Alright.
[377:12.97]Last time I did this was bingo like four months ago.
[377:22.68]This doesn't count as like money laundering, right?
[377:24.48]No, it doesn't count because I just lose money.
[377:29.78]Let me get to the channel.
[377:32.54]Double or nothing?
[377:33.62]Double or nothing.
[377:35.82]200 gifted subs if I can't do it.
[377:42.64]Two fucking hundred.
[377:46.10]Double or nothing?
[377:48.28]For ten minutes?
[377:49.62]No!
[377:50.32]It's never going to happen.
[377:52.36]That will never happen.
[377:53.40]I can guarantee that.
[377:56.55]For ten minutes, I can do it.
[377:58.97]God damn it.
[378:04.35]No, I'm looking giggly and laughy right now.
[378:06.29]It's not going to work.
[378:08.06]It should be five.
[378:08.88]Yeah, no, double nothing.
[378:10.10]The time is the same.
[378:11.74]Ten minutes is no way.
[378:12.86]I can't fucking close my mouth for ten minutes.
[378:17.56]Guys, like, in four minutes I put my hands up and I laugh at my fingers sometimes.
[378:21.58]Like, that's not gonna work.
[378:22.84]I'm one of the fucking weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[378:25.64]It's not gonna happen.
[378:30.05]It's hard because I know I see chat like over here in the corner of my eye.
[378:32.93]I'm not even paying attention to you guys.
[378:34.83]And all I see, I see, I can feel what you guys are writing.
[378:37.97]You're writing, somebody wrote like fucking brap.
[378:40.77]And I don't even think that's funny.
[378:43.51]And like, I fucking just like, I can second, I can feel that word.
[378:47.66]And it's just like, fuck, I... Turn off the monitor.
[378:55.58]Alright, here we go.
[378:56.18]Double or nothing.
[378:57.96]Same time.
[378:58.36]Five minutes, 200 gifted subs if I don't fucking do it.
[379:01.59]I'm getting ready for this one.
[379:02.51]I gotta think about, like, fucking just... I'm gonna think about, like... You know what I'm gonna think about?
[379:06.47]I'm gonna think about, like, fucking bad, mean stuff.
[379:11.55]This is that crying fucking face.
[379:16.26]I'm just gonna make sure that I don't do anything fucking... I gotta get it out of me.
[379:21.81]I'm just going to put a picture of something.
[379:23.17]No, because I think it's funny after like a minute or two.
[379:26.03]Snap a meerkat.
[379:26.83]I've got to get that off the screen.
[379:27.71]I've got to get you guys off the screen.
[379:28.69]Alright, 200 gifted subs if I don't do this in another five minutes.
[379:34.79]But, hold on.
[379:35.41]I've got to think of everything that's ever funny.
[379:37.86]Right now, and I've got to laugh about it.
[379:44.36]Alright, here we go.
[379:45.76]Five minutes, double or nothing, 200 subs.
[379:47.20]If I don't get it, I'm already going to fucking up.
[379:50.84]Alright.
[379:54.72]We gotta get an official tim- I can see it, the timer, right here.
[379:57.72]We're at 6, 20, 27, so at the top of the minute here, at 6 hours and 21 minutes streamed, that's where it begins.
[380:05.29]No talking.
[380:06.81]No bursts.
[380:09.09]Justin, I gotta- I'm turning the fucking screen off.
[380:10.83]I don't wanna see you guys.
[380:14.03]No, that's cheating.
[380:16.19]Here we go.
[380:17.83]The minute's about to turn here.
[380:20.21]Somebody- Okay, I'm not looking to fucking chat ever again.
[380:23.69]Ahem.
[380:29.40]Here it comes.
[380:29.80]Three, two.
[380:43.97]Triple or nothing.
[380:53.96]Triple or nothing.
[380:54.88]300.
[380:55.32]300 if I can't do it.
[381:01.75]Triple or nothing on the table.
[381:04.43]I can't have you guys here.
[381:06.35]I see like fucking faces over here.
[381:08.13]I know you guys are fucking with me.
[381:10.81]Triple or nothing.
[381:13.27]300 gifted subs but I don't get it.
[381:14.35]Five minutes.
[381:20.93]Triple or nothing.
[381:23.36]Ready?
[381:26.90]Five minutes.
[381:27.42]Triple or nothing.
[381:38.96]Shhh.
[391:01.44]I told you I could fucking do it.
[391:03.50]I said to bring five grand to the casino and put $1,000 and then lose it in one hand, put $2,000 and lose it, and then put $3,000, $2,000, and then win.
[391:15.09]No, you bring $5,000 to the casino, put a $500 hand on blackjack, you lose it.
[391:18.63]$2,000 hand on blackjack, you lose it.
[391:21.23]Fucking another $2,500 hand on blackjack, you hit it, get out, go home.
[391:32.71]Did I get the photo?
[391:33.43]I got the photo.
[391:34.01]Let's get out of here.
[391:40.10]Quadruple or nothing, I already did it!
[391:46.78]What would that- that would've been... That would've been what, like, fucking $1500 spent?
[391:52.74]For, what, 300 subs?
[391:59.05]So I would've... If it's like two grand... Holy fuck.
[392:12.31]Fifteen hundred.
[392:13.89]What the hell are we even doing on this stream anymore?
[392:17.03]Is it time to go?
[392:21.67]Well, it is off the camera, that's for sure.
[392:34.52]No, you should have... The people that were saying double or nothing... Should have just let me sleep in my bed.
[392:40.33]No, let's give them the photo.
[392:54.88]What's wrong with the controller?
[392:59.14]Nobody said triple or nothing.
[393:00.26]Yeah, that was me panicking.
[393:03.22]This is the best one.
[393:10.64]We don't want you to lose money.
[393:12.86]It's alright.
[393:13.36]Alright, cute animal request.
[393:17.64]I've gained viewers doing that.
[393:23.43]There were like 2700 people here when I started doing that.
[393:31.29]And now there's like 3200.
[393:34.44]If you lost triple or nothing, would you have done quadruple?
[393:36.50]No, that's strike three.
[393:37.30]It has to be standing?
[393:44.03]Oh, fuck, it does.
[393:50.79]Triple or nothing, because that is strike four.
[393:52.51]You can't go strike four.
[393:53.75]That's not how that works.
[394:07.37]Technically standing.
[394:12.26]People logged on their smurf Twitch account to get the free sub.
[394:23.07]Quadruple or nothing.
[394:24.57]No, man.
[394:26.39]No way.
[394:28.35]Have to triple enough of it, that's it.
[394:31.55]I broke even at the casino, and my heart is in my fucking stomach, and I'm slowly gonna walk out of the casino and be like, holy fuck, I'm never doing that again.
[394:40.83]$2,000 joke.
[394:56.91]Well, yeah, technically I would be paying... I would just be giving Twitch money.
[395:00.95]Like, I would just be giving them money.
[395:03.25]I did that before.
[395:08.52]How about just for fun?
[395:10.22]Let me save the game first.
[395:26.45]Yeah, and then I would inflate my sub count and then in a month it would come back down.
[395:37.70]People are leaving?
[395:38.72]It's alright, we're getting to the end anyways.
[395:41.44]In fact, we're probably gonna call it pretty soon here.
[395:44.20]It's been about seven hours.
[396:02.15]Logging out of their smurfs.
[396:08.58]You're going to play a stunt like that and then go?
[396:12.87]I would have done it.
[396:14.27]If I had lost on that third time, I would have done it.
[396:39.41]Stunt like five minutes of silence.
[397:12.24]Alright, where are we going?
[397:20.33]Oh, let me just take a pee break.
[397:21.57]I'll be right back.
[397:22.21]Let me just take a quick piss break.
[399:24.86]Alright, guys.
[399:25.18]So, uh, here's what's gonna happen.
[399:28.43]Gonna give you a consolation prize.
[399:30.53]50 community subs coming out right now.
[399:50.62]Psych!
[399:50.96]Oh, here they come.
[400:02.98]This generous streamer says, you know what, to the casino, take my money anyway.
[400:07.94]Congratulations, whoever gets it.
[400:09.70]Oh, I gotta change my monitor here.
[400:19.91]Hey, hey, thanks a lot, Jerma985.
[400:32.43]He's pretending.
[400:34.09]That's not pretending.
[400:44.50]What the fuck?
[400:45.22]Holy shit!
[400:46.82]50 community subs!
[400:57.75]You know, I bet too much money.
[400:58.61]I bet too much.
[401:03.62]And it's all good.
[401:04.76]Because half of that money then comes back.
[401:07.06]That was fun.
[401:18.09]You guys got like the house edge, you know what I mean?
[401:20.55]Even if you played a casino, if I was putting like three grand on the line there, even if I didn't lose, even if you play blackjack perfectly, that's still like a one or two percent house edge.
[401:33.78]You know?
[401:38.09]Egotistic streamer donates money to himself and demands thanks for it.
[401:43.63]Now that was fun.
[401:53.07]And I think with that, I think I'm gonna call it there.
[401:57.57]I think that's a good enough to go out on.
[401:59.41]Did about seven hours.
[402:01.53]Gonna take us about an hour to go through the bits.
[402:03.57]Oh my fucking god.
[402:04.59]Wait, wait, why did you match me?
[402:06.37]No, you just gave the money back.
[402:08.24]No, you gave me, you gave the house, the casino just gave me the house edge back.
[402:15.90]No, you weren't supposed to match me.
[402:18.42]Well, there it is.
[402:19.04]There's your 100 community subs, guys.
[402:20.78]From me failing it the first time.
[402:24.57]There you go.
[402:27.64]That first failure when I said a hundred... There it is.
[402:30.84]I decided to get matched by hahahaha kuma.
[402:36.32]Chichi.
[402:39.00]Thank you for the 50 matched community subs to make it 100.
[402:48.28]The promise was delivered if it wasn't me completely.
[402:52.01]Only 200 more to go?
[402:54.01]No, that's 100.
[403:05.72]Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[403:09.02]We're gonna take off here now.
[403:10.78]That's a good time.
[403:11.48]That's a good note to close it out on.
[403:13.14]That was an interesting thing to close it out on.
[403:16.35]That was Africa.
[403:17.19]I think it was a fun game.
[403:20.41]Relaxing.
[403:22.13]Hard to, uh, keep a straight face when you're silently sitting there.
[403:27.97]And so the plan for the next couple days is I really have to play this by ear.
[403:33.94]Because I really don't know what the scenario's gonna be, because like I said,
[403:38.24]when Etalyx and I are both trying to stream at the same time or try to use the internet at the same time sometimes it just fucking kills the whole thing so it seems to be fixed though at least in a packet loss frame drop kind of way we might have another issue entirely so I tomorrow I plan on streaming vive tomorrow but just stay stay alert
[404:03.50]Because around the stream time tomorrow around like 2 to 3 p.m.
[404:08.24]I'm gonna be around to give you guys an update on what what's actually happening because who knows this might just be a random fluke of a day Oh VRB that's not true This might be like a random day that's a fluke where I get a green light for like seven hours for no reason
[404:29.71]But I'll see you maybe tomorrow.
[404:33.45]I don't know.
[404:33.89]We'll find out.
[404:38.23]Thanks for joining me.
[404:39.13]That was a lot of fun.
[404:41.46]That was a fun, relaxing, just chill hangout stream.
[404:47.58]Thank you for the massive amount of community subs.
[404:50.04]Especially right at the end there from HaHaHa.
[404:57.35]Much love to you all.
[404:58.03]I'll see you all maybe tomorrow.
[405:00.62]I'll let you guys know either on Twitter or here.
[405:06.40]And with that, let's do the bits.
[405:07.62]What do you say?
[405:15.62]Let's pull it up here.
[405:19.72]Did I look into the OpenVR plugin?
[405:22.78]Yeah, I have this open VR.
[405:24.68]There's a couple of other things.
[405:25.56]There's like a chat.
[405:26.16]I can do chat, right?
[405:27.76]If I get a certain thing, I have chat on my hand.
[405:29.73]I've been looking into a lot of them.
[405:32.89]Let's scroll back down to earlier this evening.
[405:39.05]To seven hours ago now.
[405:40.29]Just about seven-ish hours ago.
[405:44.19]Yeah, OVR drop.
[405:45.19]Yeah.
[405:47.73]I'm gonna try to get it set up.
[405:49.17]The whole room is set up, so really it's just software stuff that I can do tonight and tomorrow.
[405:56.76]Uh, but thank you Rise Fall of Ziggy.
[406:00.26]Thank you for the five dollars.
[406:01.88]Ziggy Stardust is the name.

[407:25.49]You're great.
[407:28.03]Thank you.
[407:29.67]Thank you for the $10 and thank you for sticking around.
[407:33.69]Glad you got to catch one.
[407:35.29]Maybe we'll see you again soon.
[407:38.33]Mostly Lost, thanks for the 10.
[407:39.59]No, that's a $1 for Mostly Lost.
[407:42.68]The game should work fine if you delete the streamer.
[407:45.72]That was seven hours ago, and then somehow we came back to that seven hours later.
[407:52.99]Wow.
[407:53.69]Nice foreshadowing.
[407:56.11]We had 50 community subs from Great Canadian Fuck Club, right?
[408:03.75]God.
[408:04.23]And then Whiff Whiff gave a bunch to...
[408:08.46]There pretty much was 200 or 300 community subs tonight.
[408:11.92]Just combined.
[408:12.60]So double or nothing, triple or nothing, don't really matter.
[408:17.72]Thank you to both of you.
[408:21.55]MostlyLost also gave $50.
[408:26.91]I think I somehow missed this.
[408:30.93]If you're still here, MostlyLost, thank you so much for your large amount of money.
[408:39.98]Finally, I missed bits.
[408:41.88]I'm so sorry.
[408:43.47]What was I doing here?
[408:44.37]I don't know.
[408:47.13]But, thanks a lot, man.
[408:48.51]They say, here, I assume this is what you paid for the game, so let me reimburse you for it.
[408:52.51]Oh, wait.
[408:55.72]Uh, the game was just about, I think it was $50 total.
[408:59.56]Like, $48 or something.
[409:01.92]But, thank you.
[409:04.62]Jerma985, thanks for donating, dude.
[409:11.64]What do I have for a sub count now?
[409:13.90]I have over 5,800.
[409:16.12]It was almost 7,000 something, I think.
[409:21.66]I think it was just under 7,000.
[409:22.92]Was it 7,200 or something before?
[409:25.36]With the insane amount of community subs?
[409:32.48]Yeah, there was like... I had over... Was it over 7,000 or was it up to... It's like 68 or something.
[409:40.81]But we're at about 58.
[409:41.67]I think some of you guys... Yeah, 65.
[409:46.88]There were so many community subs last month.
[409:49.52]It was ridiculous.
[409:57.46]But thanks a lot, MostlyLoss.
[410:04.06]How do you handle the fluctuating income as a streamer?
[410:05.88]Do you just live well below your income at any time?
[410:09.76]Yeah, I mean...
[410:12.92]I just... I mean, for the most part... I think that as long as... Like, look, if you're paying your bills, and you pay for, you know, food and bills and... Just because you're making... Like, I'm making very, very good money from you guys.
[410:35.27]It's fucking insane.
[410:39.35]But, I mean, living below your means, I mean, five, six, seven, eight thousand subscriptions on Twitch, you're talking, that's a ton of money.
[410:48.90]So, I just, you know, want to save some money, I want to put a lot of money back into the stream, which is what I try to do.
[410:57.25]I mean, I spend...
[411:02.05]A significant percentage of every dollar that I make from Twitch goes back to, you know, studio shit and buying games and buying systems and... Hiring people and... So I'd like to... Because then there's another... I mean, obviously there's the realistic approach too, right?
[411:23.35]Where...
[411:25.07]You know, if you make a really good amount of money doing something like this, because it's such a kind of volatile place, you know, like streaming and YouTube, it's not like, oh, this is the amount of money that you're going to make.
[411:38.50]And you're going to make that probably for like five to 10 years.
[411:41.14]And maybe you could get a promotion.
[411:42.36]Maybe that's what the money you're going to make for like two decades.
[411:44.73]Like, I have no idea.
[411:47.97]You know, there's really no way to tell.
[411:50.17]So why not just try to do what I can and save what I can and make as good of a stream as I can while I'm here.
[412:05.22]But I'm along for the ride, however long it takes.
[412:10.15]You know, wherever this train leads to, I'm gonna ride it.
[412:13.25]Let's just get on it, right?
[412:17.63]Like, your money can go way up in a couple months and then just drop off.
[412:22.07]No, yeah, it can.
[412:22.89]It can.
[412:28.05]But I've been showered with such generosity over the last year that I'm living well in my means.
[412:39.81]So thank you all for the support.
[412:43.47]For real.
[412:46.84]But hopefully that answers the question.
[412:50.60]And let's go to... Kyra Toby gave a shitload of community subs.
[412:56.37]Winter Parsley... Winterly Parsley gave a bunch of community subs.
[412:59.53]It was like fucking 200 or 300.
[413:08.32]That was a lot.
[413:09.00]A lot, a lot, a lot.
[413:13.01]And then we had, uh, lobotomized teddy bear gave a dollar.
[413:16.21]Jerma, I'm happy you're teaching chat about, um, African animals before they are all basically dead in, like, 20 years.
[413:23.64]That's so morbid.
[413:28.42]That's not... Oh, God.
[413:35.42]Well, I hope you liked the elephant.
[413:42.88]Somebody mentioned about taxes.
[413:43.96]Yeah, I mean, there's taxes on every dollar that I make from Twitch.
[413:50.73]You know, it's not just... It's not just like, oh, this is the amount of money you make from a sub, and that's yours.
[413:57.31]You get to keep.
[413:57.99]No, there's taxes.
[414:01.99]It's hard to do taxes when you just sort of completely have 1099 as income is what it's called.
[414:07.36]So it can get sloppy if you don't stay on top of it.
[414:12.92]But I've been doing just fine.
[414:14.90]I have a good tax person.
[414:15.96]I talk to them all the time.
[414:27.49]As long as you stay on top of it.
[414:30.43]Tax boy.
[414:33.71]But thank you, Lobato by SteadyBear.
[414:35.69]A Louie thanks for the $1.
[414:36.99]Or Louis with a large underscore.
[414:39.50]Thank you.
[414:42.04]Well, unfortunately, I don't know if that's a great idea.
[414:44.55]Why would they replace your blood with pee?
[414:46.15]Well, if the first part is true, that's really really kind of you and good of you to do.
[415:08.44]Hopefully it goes to somebody that really needs it, so thank you for doing that, if that's true.
[415:13.73]For the P part, I would probably not sign that waiver.
[415:19.23]I'm not sure you should do that.
[415:22.11]But thank you.
[415:22.59]Thank you, Tar Alacrin, for the $1.
[415:24.11]Hey, Jeremy, great gameplay today.
[415:25.25]Really riveting.
[415:25.91]And they do a sarcastic I'm smiling face.
[415:29.89]Anyways, have you considered playing one of those newfangled randomizers like a Zelda game?
[415:36.42]That are all the rage these days.
[415:37.84]If you are worried about getting lost, I don't think it would be distinguishable from you playing a game normally.
[415:45.36]Hopefully we see a couple of ee-hees from that one.
[415:50.40]Randomizer stuff, though?
[415:53.56]Once I'm done with everything else that I want to do.
[415:56.62]There's a bunch of shit that I want to do.
[415:59.01]Yeah, once I can kind of take the brick, because I bought a bunch of PlayStation 2 games.
[416:03.27]I've got to admit it to you guys.
[416:06.99]I just went on like a PlayStation 2 spree again.
[416:09.47]I bought like 10 more.
[416:11.27]Already on top of like the fucking 10 that is still there to be played.
[416:14.83]So we're going to have to do another PlayStation 2.
[416:20.39]I got the Jaws game where you play as the shark.
[416:24.13]I just had to buy it.
[416:25.29]I had to get it.
[416:33.57]That game is great.
[416:34.51]I know.
[416:34.87]I know.
[416:38.39]There's a lot to do.
[416:40.85]But, thank you.
[416:41.47]Thank you, BinaryMan, for the $5.11.
[416:44.11]Sorry, Jerma, but I had to.
[416:45.81]To anyone who can actually play this properly, I apologize for the bad playing, but I learned it on the spot while waiting for the stream to start.
[416:55.75]Uh... Well... What is it?
[417:02.19]It's a YouTube link?
[417:10.35]There's a stream in the corner.
[417:12.21]That's it.
[417:13.29]That's the whole thing.
[417:43.70]Thank you so much.
[417:44.36]That was, uh, that sounded pretty great.
[417:46.98]Thank you, Binary Man.
[417:53.72]Thank you, Dork Cube, for the $1.
[417:55.14]Firefox and Twitch don't mix too well, so when I went to look at the emotes and saw that you had what looked like 50 emotes that were all duplicates, I was confused.
[418:06.57]What the fuck?
[418:12.67]That's a weird bug.
[418:16.55]That's a very strange bug.
[418:22.58]That's a lot of emote slots.
[418:27.30]But thank you, Torque Cube, for the $1.
[418:29.48]Hey, Flank Tank, thanks for the $10.
[418:32.74]$10 from Flank Tank.
[418:33.32]Hey, I heard from a little Safari birdie that on February 26th, Nier Automata was releasing its own Prepare to Die Scholar of the First Sin version with all the DLC for, I think, half off.
[418:44.24]Not sure what the other changes will be, but that might be a good time to look into it.
[418:47.91]Term of Venus.
[418:52.81]Uh, sure.
[418:53.53]Yeah.
[418:54.65]Yeah.
[418:59.57]I've never played it.
[419:00.38]I never played the other one.
[419:01.28]There's like a series, right?
[419:02.50]There's like Nier, then there's Nier Automata.
[419:09.26]I don't know really anything about them.
[419:10.92]All I know is that they exist.
[419:16.43]But thank you for the suggestion.
[419:17.93]I did not know that was coming out.
[419:18.97]I will definitely be looking into it.
[419:22.51]Thank you for the $10.
[419:24.25]Hey, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the three bucks.
[419:25.73]This is your situation with Cox right now.
[419:29.24]I'm surrounded, I'm covered in discs.
[419:32.64]There are discs all over me.
[419:35.02]There are discs in every single part of my life right now.
[419:38.31]There's a disc over here.
[419:39.23]There's a disc over here.
[419:40.75]I got discs in front of me.
[419:42.03]I got discs all over me.
[419:45.45]Covered in discs.
[419:48.09]He knew what he was doing.
[419:50.31]He knew what he was doing there, making a joke.
[419:54.77]Don't let him fool you.
[420:02.38]That's got, like, that's got at least 22 thumbs up on the comment section.
[420:06.59]You know what I mean?
[420:07.01]Like, don't let him, he's fucking, he knows what he's doing, guys.
[420:18.53]But thank you, Swiggity Swanky, for the three bucks.
[420:21.79]Uh, SuperSeal, thanks for the one dollar.
[420:23.23]If a hippo woke you up in the middle of the night and personally asked you to pee in their urinal mouth... Why are you asking me this?
[420:30.45]No.
[420:30.67]The answer is no.
[420:32.65]I would call the police.
[420:35.64]Uh, Jess, you got it.
[420:37.20]Thanks for the one dollar.
[420:38.00]After two weeks, I managed to finish editing that video of all the sounds you made in January.
[420:42.90]And then it broke in rendering and I couldn't save it.
[420:45.78]I'm disappointed because it was pretty funny and I don't want to start over, so here is one of my favorites from the list of 300.
[420:52.66]so sorry to hear that that sucks but what is this oh that's Simpsons hit and run I remember that that's in The Simpsons hit and run Adam sandler the tie fighter
[421:25.22]I'm really sorry to hear about that, though.
[421:29.06]That's happened to me quite a few times.
[421:31.04]Where in Premiere, you're working on something for like three days and then all of a sudden it fucks up and the save doesn't work.
[421:39.45]Or like you spend three hours on something and then you lose the three hours of it.
[421:43.51]You go back and you're like, what the fuck?
[421:45.01]I don't even want to do this again.
[421:46.25]And then you try to get more motivated to do the same cuts, the same edits that you just did already.
[421:52.58]It's awful.
[421:54.61]So, I'm really sorry to hear that that happened.
[421:57.63]But thank you for the attempt, and thank you for the clip.
[422:05.30]And thank you C4G for the $4.83.
[422:06.72]And they say, uh, Pride, hey you fucking gamer.
[422:12.66]And they say Pride.
[422:14.14]Hey, thank you.
[422:15.76]For the $4.83.
[422:16.88]C4G.
[422:20.00]I like to call myself a gamer sometimes.
[422:23.08]Hey future gamers, thanks for the one dollar.
[422:25.16]How much have you used the Vive already?
[422:27.02]Have you not even put it on yet?
[422:29.06]I have not logged into any Vive related games.
[422:34.82]I have done the setup.
[422:36.41]So I painted the room with the hand, right?
[422:40.67]Like I did the perimeter, I got everything ready to go.
[422:44.27]So I've not played a game in it yet because I want my first experience to happen on stream.
[422:52.92]So, it does fit.
[422:54.42]It does work.
[422:56.02]It's just a question of getting into a game, capturing it, and streaming it.
[423:04.02]And we will see how that happens tomorrow.
[423:06.76]Again, like, I don't want to be this guy that sits here and tells you, there might be a stream tomorrow, but there might not.
[423:12.38]But there might be a stream, but there may be not a stream tomorrow.
[423:16.07]That's unfortunately the way I have to look at it right now.
[423:18.37]Until this is confirmed, which it hasn't been, the technician I'm working with has not closed the ticket yet.
[423:28.00]So until that ticket is closed, and yes, that issue is resolved, I can't tell you that there's going to be a stream tomorrow.
[423:36.84]I don't know.
[423:37.24]Because, like again, Italic streams from this location too.
[423:42.10]So we have to both use it.
[423:48.31]I'm sorry to say that I wish I could tell you it was going to happen, but I don't know.
[423:51.67]We might have to wait another day.
[423:53.27]We'll see.
[423:54.49]I'm optimistic.
[423:58.29]At least he kept the ticket open.
[423:59.53]Yeah, he's going to keep it open until it's completely confirmed that it is done and closed.
[424:07.52]FutureGamer, thanks for the $1.
[424:09.52]Again, I cannot wait to watch you WWE chair shot someone in Blade and Sorcery.
[424:16.64]I don't know what that means, but I'm looking forward to it.
[424:21.17]Whatever that is.
[424:24.27]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the $2.
[424:25.41]Hey, Jerma, I don't know if you remember when I made the LEGO Glue Man render.
[424:30.20]Well, I made a Sneak Man render that I posted in Creative, and it was a bit shit.
[424:34.70]So I came back and took a running leap at it.
[424:36.82]I present Mr. LEGO Sneak Man Remastered.
[424:47.01]Lego Sneak Man!
[424:52.73]He's got these ripped abs.
[424:57.18]Lego really... Lego is one of those things that will always be a thing.
[425:06.10]The test of time has passed over Legos, and they are still just as popular, and still just as relevant as they were 20, 30 years ago.
[425:19.35]It will always be relevant.
[425:28.55]But thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[425:29.61]It's a great render.
[425:31.91]The Gloom Man one was great as well.
[425:35.73]And they got a comparison.
[425:36.81]They say, hey, if you want a comparison, here are the two comparisons.
[425:39.49]Let's take a look.
[425:48.72]The second one's a little cleaner.
[425:53.04]There's some better shading on the second one.
[425:58.85]Looks good.
[426:00.07]Thank you for that.
[426:00.59]Are the LEGO movies really good?
[426:06.36]Aren't they really highly rated movies?
[426:11.53]Like Lego Batman and Lego Island.
[426:14.75]Not Lego Island, Lego World.
[426:16.02]What was the Lego movie?
[426:17.96]That had like a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes or something.
[426:22.08]So, I mean, they're doing just fine.
[426:26.04]Thank you YesIsOnline for the $1 MyFaceWin.
[426:28.68]I realize that all elephants are clay.
[426:31.38]What does your face do?
[426:40.49]You've been in love with something else your whole life.
[426:45.01]What the fuck?
[426:52.04]This is an Alex Jones and Death Grips mashup.
[426:57.94]That's what this is.
[427:14.73]Link it.
[427:15.13]Link.
[427:15.47]Link.
[427:20.95]Here.
[427:21.25]Here.
[427:21.47]Here.
[427:21.75]Here.
[427:21.99]I'm giving it to you.
[427:25.04]Thank you for that.
[427:25.82]Yes, it's online.
[427:27.46]My face when all elephants are clay.
[427:31.44]A Freudian weapon.
[427:32.16]Thanks for the $11.
[427:33.24]I could honestly write an essay about how inspirational you've been to me.
[427:38.66]Thank you for the $11 and I'm
[427:41.71]I can't believe it that somebody would say something like that.
[427:44.17]So thank you so much.
[427:45.19]I'm happy that you can find any inspiration from this stream or from the videos.
[427:50.69]That means a lot.
[427:51.17]Thank you so much, Protean.
[427:52.17]Thank you for the $11.
[427:56.49]Appreciate it.
[428:00.13]Coming up to Colorblind Samurai.
[428:02.44]Thanks for the $5.12.
[428:05.12]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to let you know that you mean a lot more to a lot of us than you know.
[428:09.36]A year ago today, my dad died of brain cancer.
[428:12.20]Fuck cancer.
[428:13.64]And since then, I've graduated from college, gotten a really good job, but none of that would have been possible if I couldn't watch your streams and VODs to help me get back mentally from whatever shitty place I was in.
[428:23.29]All the love I've got to you, man.
[428:28.11]I'm incredibly fucking sorry to hear that.
[428:34.33]I'll tell you something right now, though.
[428:36.61]Graduated from college, got a great job.
[428:40.41]They'd be really fucking proud of you.
[428:47.27]Thank you so much for being part of this community.
[428:57.00]And yeah, fuck cancer.
[429:03.07]Hopefully, someday soon, we will get rid of that fucking awful, awful, awful, awful thing forever.
[429:14.18]Thank you so much, ColorBrands, for saving my life for the $5.12.
[429:18.05]And I know I just kind of butchered your name, but, you know, I'm... I'm, uh... That means a lot.
[429:24.92]That means a fucking lot.
[429:35.17]So I'm happy to be able to tell you that I appreciate the fuck out of you being here.
[429:44.78]And if I can even give you a semblance, even a second of happiness in a place where you're not having a good time, then fuck yeah.
[429:53.92]I'm happy to be there.
[429:58.64]Thank you so much again for your $5.12.
[430:03.60]And yeah, fuck cancer.
[430:05.30]For real.
[430:11.91]And congratulations on getting a good job.
[430:19.27]Cheers to you.
[430:24.54]And moving on from that, we got Vroom had $1 of Vroom.
[430:29.95]If you want to emulate video games, you have to pretend that you're on the legit hardware.
[430:33.77]L-U-L.
[430:34.35]Well, that has nothing to do with pretending.
[430:39.21]If you want to emulate video games, you have to pretend that you're on the... No.
[430:43.15]The emulator's just some... There's a whole list of games that can't run on those emulators.
[430:50.02]And some of them that do are classified by the community involved in trying to get them to work.
[431:02.74]I remember, I tried, I tried.
[431:05.18]This is not, this didn't happen on stream.
[431:07.42]This happened, this was like a long time ago.
[431:09.70]Like two or three years ago.
[431:11.22]This was not that long ago.
[431:13.38]But WWF No Mercy is one of my favorite Nintendo 64 games ever.
[431:18.64]I've owned that game like three times.
[431:21.86]It's my favorite N64 game, is that game.
[431:26.14]Now, I wanted to play it, you know, a couple years ago.
[431:30.36]And what happened was I got, I was like, oh, I can't, how am I going to track down any of this shit?
[431:34.20]I got to try to emulate it.
[431:36.44]And there was a ton of weird bugs and problems and glitches.
[431:39.78]And I couldn't get it to work properly no matter what tutorials I tried.
[431:43.63]So from that day forward, I decided I was going to, I'm going just legit only.
[431:48.07]I'm going to buy the hardware and just play it the way it was meant to be played on an NVIDIA graphics card.
[431:53.70]But not really.
[431:59.61]the way it was meant to be played.
[432:05.07]Sponsored.
[432:09.49]Oh, internet.
[432:10.64]I just saw a flash of bad internet.
[432:15.50]But didn't you try to get the ISO for that Dreamcast game a week ago?
[432:21.65]Yeah, but that was desperate because I bought the game
[432:26.92]purchased that game and it came to me delivered to me the game that I bought and it wasn't in the case it was half of the game so I figured that's I that's not I'm okay I owned that game I currently have it sitting right here I bought it that's different you know you can't sure me on that one
[432:55.61]I purchased a game and the game was not there.
[432:59.89]I got the second disc of two discs for a game that I purchased.
[433:04.05]And I can't just go to like Walmart or like GameStop and buy a new one.
[433:08.07]The game doesn't even fucking exist anymore.
[433:11.79]They're selling it like third party, fourth party.
[433:16.09]So of course I'm going to look into some alternative actions and ways to make it work.
[433:22.77]You guys act like that was like fucking...
[433:26.38]That was like Battlefield 4.
[433:29.50]I can go buy that right now and get it.
[433:31.82]They probably still sell that game at Walmart.
[433:43.03]Yeah, fourth party.
[433:50.89]But here's the thing.
[433:51.83]Once you get the hardware...
[433:54.34]Once you slowly build up, like I've got a PlayStation 1, I got the Dreamcast, I got PlayStation 2, I got, well, I had a SEGA CD and then I gave it to a friend of mine.
[434:04.02]But the point is, then you have it all and you own it all.
[434:07.42]And if you ever want to play like an N64 game, bingo, just go get it.
[434:12.11]And you just stick it in there and cap it and you can play it like one-to-one real-time the way it was meant to be played on the cartridge.
[434:20.60]It's getting late to get this upset.
[434:22.04]I'm not upset.
[434:23.46]I'm just speaking matter-of-factly.
[434:27.98]And then it breaks.
[434:29.52]And then you go get the emulator.
[434:31.95]And you pretend that you're not on the emulator.
[434:37.59]Thank you, though, Vroom.
[434:38.29]Appreciate it.
[434:39.89]Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[434:41.35]Hey, Jerma, it's midnight on the East Coast, and that means it's officially my birthday.
[434:44.17]Did you get me anything cool?
[434:46.55]I got you a finger snap.
[434:50.28]No, happy birthday, Sly.
[434:51.58]I don't know exactly how old you are, but happy birthday.
[434:58.51]Happy birthday.
[435:02.63]Cartridges die constantly.
[435:04.01]Well, then I would back it up.
[435:07.04]I would make the ROM myself.
[435:08.82]That's not against the law.
[435:09.58]I would put the ROM device in, and I would pull it from the source, and I'd make my own ROM from my own cartridge.
[435:15.26]That's what I would do.
[435:15.96]That's what I would be doing.
[435:26.38]thank you sly happy birthday dork cube thanks for the one dollar hey Jerm I hope you and Kim uh and Etalyx had a happy Valentine's day well I didn't have a Valentine this year I did find out that my brother is gonna propose to his girlfriend tomorrow so I'm pretty excited that's exciting stuff I wish uh your brother the best of luck and many years of happiness for you and your brother
[435:55.73]But yeah, me and Kim had a good, we did a Valentine's Day before Valentine's Day because it was also our anniversary on the 13th.
[436:05.57]So we did like a dual, let's go out and go to dinner and do like a Valentine's Day before Valentine's.
[436:11.30]It's like Christmas with your birthday at the same time.
[436:13.38]You know, if you have your birthday the day before Christmas, you know, you celebrate your birthday and Christmas on the same day.
[436:21.34]It's a dual day.
[436:22.92]That's right.
[436:24.39]What a rip-off.
[436:25.21]What?
[436:28.41]Rip-off.
[436:30.39]Thank you, Dorkube.
[436:31.85]I wish luck to your brother and his girlfriend.
[436:36.73]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[436:37.94]This guy is asking the real questions.
[436:39.24]Who?
[436:41.74]It's Imgrlink.
[436:43.02]Let's see.
[436:45.44]I'm trying to actually gain some muscles on my bony arms, but I don't know where to start.
[436:49.06]Any recommendations for how I can get started and be like 2012 Jerma?
[436:53.79]yes eat you just you gotta eat and eat and eat it's coming from a skinny skinny skinny guy you need to eat a shitload and that does not mean McDonald's okay I'm not talking about yeah just go get like a large pizza from Domino's and eat that and then go no no you need high quality quality protein
[437:25.66]You need to make sure that you've taken a good high-quality protein a little bit before and especially after you work out.
[437:37.50]Within 30 minutes to an hour of you lifting weights, you've got to take in a high-quality protein.
[437:42.92]Your muscles need to recover, goddammit.
[437:47.68]You need to be eating a lot of calories, but you don't want to eat bad garbage food.
[437:51.76]You want to eat high-quality, high-calorie foods.
[437:55.04]So this is kind of disgusting.
[437:56.94]I'll tell you guys a little tidbit, something that I used to do, but this is not advice.
[438:00.98]I'm not giving advice to anybody.
[438:04.44]I don't want anyone to take this and be like, oh, that's what I should do.
[438:09.14]Back when I was trying to really gain mass, I would... Does anybody know what tahini is?
[438:21.06]tahini tahini is how they it's it's what's in hummus so it's hummus is usually chickpeas tahini and garlic and maybe a little bit of lime it is ground up sesame seeds and it is the highest
[438:45.99]caloric food you can possibly eat, pound for pound.
[438:50.23]It is one of the highest calorie foods you could possibly eat.
[438:54.72]And I used to eat it like peanut butter.
[438:57.44]Speaking of peanut butter, let's move on from that.
[439:01.18]Don't do what I do.
[439:03.02]But tahini is really, really good.
[439:05.22]You put it on a salad, you put it, just use it where you should be using it.
[439:08.87]Don't eat spoonfuls of it like a psycho because, I mean, it's like 300 calories a spoonful.
[439:13.55]Don't do that.
[439:14.79]But peanut butter,
[439:19.47]That's your best friend.
[439:21.56]If you like peanut butter, you can eat a lot of it and not really feel that guilty about it.
[439:26.56]It's high in fat.
[439:27.20]Just be careful.
[439:27.86]Don't go crazy.
[439:31.70]Because you don't want to cause a stomach problem or a digestive issue for yourself if you're just like, I'm going to eat a jar of peanut butter every day.
[439:40.75]High quality proteins, especially after you fucking work out.
[439:48.89]But I used to, like, just do, like, a spoonful of tahini before bed.
[439:54.05]And it's not bad for you.
[439:54.73]It's a sesame seed paste.
[439:55.93]Sesame seed spread.
[439:56.97]It's good.
[439:58.44]Put it on a piece of toast.
[440:02.60]Somebody's mentioning fish.
[440:03.52]Yes.
[440:05.20]We're talking... I used to eat... But I don't... This is, like, bad advice, though.
[440:10.61]I used to eat tuna out of the can like a cat.
[440:13.93]I would eat, like, a can of tuna...
[440:17.80]I would eat the cheapest tuna I could get out of the can.
[440:23.11]It was like 78 cents a can.
[440:30.25]Tuna's amazing.
[440:30.95]I love tuna fish, but I ate it a lot too much.
[440:37.23]I hate the tuna fish.
[440:41.08]But I did gain weight.
[440:48.08]salmon there's also like the rock okay listen to the rock but don't listen to the rock because the rock ate like 12 pounds of cod a day or something right fish is the best possible food you can eat if you really want to like bodybuild it so it's just like good high quality protein and high quality fats don't think that just eating more is better like I said going to get like a big mac every day is going to cause you way more problems
[441:18.82]The Rock eats a three-layer cake for breakfast every day.
[441:28.42]But yeah, I loved, when I was working out, I loved cod, I loved tuna, I loved salmon.
[441:34.87]Chicken, just like, chicken breast is really easy to eat and really easy to make.
[441:40.09]You can make a ton of it and just have like, you know, get some, but don't eat like fucking meats.
[441:46.65]Get like some good nice lean chicken breast.
[441:49.17]Cook it up.
[441:50.19]Get some carrots in there.
[441:51.25]You want to eat a bunch of like good amount of carrots and like greens.
[441:54.85]You want a balanced good diet.
[441:56.36]You want to be lifting and you want to fucking bring those high quality proteins into your life.
[441:59.84]After you work out especially.
[442:04.74]Don't rely.
[442:05.60]Don't rely on the shit in the box that says like oh yeah this is all these things in this box.
[442:11.38]Drink it.
[442:13.66]Gotta eat food.
[442:16.11]You can supplement with those like fucking drinks.
[442:21.25]You can supplement with the drinks, but don't make those drinks the main course for your routine.
[442:35.04]Eat carrots before and after you work out.
[442:37.02]No, you don't have to do that.
[442:44.74]But yeah, I have not been to the gym in a long time.
[442:49.06]I just gotta... I wish I could still do it.
[442:54.18]It started getting harder to do post-30.
[442:55.82]It really did.
[442:56.58]33, 34, it's... It got hard to do.
[443:04.11]I really am deteriorating, huh?
[443:14.58]Okay, if I was streaming... Okay, rewind the clock, but also fast-forward the clock.
[443:20.19]Okay?
[443:21.61]If I was... If I'm right now in the twitch.tv seat here, Jerma985, right now, and it's me from 2012 sitting here, and I would have the webcam on, you guys would see just how fucking jacked and handsome I was.
[443:40.02]People would be commenting on it all the day.
[443:46.35]Oh, I would look over and, like, I would see my huge fucking arm in the rearview mirror.
[443:53.05]And I would look over at chat and be like, fuck, man, he's huge.
[443:56.88]How did he get, he's fucking so jacked.
[443:58.54]And I'd be like, yeah, fuck, I am, yeah, yeah.
[444:00.94]I wouldn't say that, but I'd be like, yeah, yeah.
[444:05.76]Not anymore.
[444:06.88]Now I look like I made out of clay.
[444:14.76]It's amazing, it's really, here's the thing, it's amazing that you never, like, see yourself age.
[444:24.08]But there are certain specific things that I know and do that, because you talk, I mean, you're talking about 2011 is when I started on YouTube, 2012.
[444:33.65]Really, I got going really in 2012.
[444:36.31]I made a bunch of videos in 2011.
[444:39.48]But it's weird to see that over almost seven to eight years, going from like 25 to like 32, 26 to like 33, it's a long time.
[444:52.43]You don't really even think about it.
[444:58.39]You look at old videos, old photos from like, you know, 2010, 2011.
[445:02.20]I'm just like, holy shit.
[445:07.01]I am like, I'm starting to look like my father.
[445:12.49]When I look at photos of me now instead of almost 10 years ago, I look like my father.
[445:17.77]I can see it.
[445:18.35]It's weird.
[445:28.50]Dad streamer.
[445:29.48]I know, it's weird.
[445:33.10]But I'm not sure how we got on that, but it was an interesting talk nonetheless.
[445:40.64]Thank you though, Demonic Cucumber, for your $2 here.
[445:44.42]Hey, Jerma, while I was watching your iSpy stream, I showed my mom, yes, the one who said you were attractive, some of my renders, and we kept having to switch back because of your crazed rant about the hot dog eating bear.
[445:57.33]She thought it was very funny, so thanks on her behalf and mine for the laugh.
[446:03.79]That's a great transition into the conversation we were just having.
[446:07.39]I love it.
[446:14.37]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[446:16.09]And thank you, Mom.
[446:20.15]Uh, Flugboy, thanks for the one dollar.
[446:21.71]I threw something together very quickly.
[446:23.11]Let's see what they threw together.
[446:32.02]Is this a JoJo thing?
[446:33.98]What the fuck are you doing?
[446:35.44]Leave me alone.
[446:35.94]What are you doing?
[446:37.98]I had it lined up perfectly.
[446:42.68]It's why the fuck aren't the hippos yawning?
[446:49.16]Here.
[446:49.90]Take a look.
[446:50.28]There it is.
[446:51.36]It's apparently me stomping on a... What am I stepping on?
[446:58.11]And that's not even me, but... What, do I just automatically assume every anime ever gets shown is a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference?
[447:11.09]Have we gotten there?
[447:14.20]But thank you, Flugboy.
[447:17.10]Thank you, Captain Worgen, for the $1.
[447:19.64]They should have got you to play younger Willem Dafoe in Aquaman.
[447:22.76]Why aren't you out there acting?
[447:26.70]I don't know.
[447:33.35]I'm doing this.
[447:34.11]I don't need to be an actor somewhere.
[447:43.73]This is an act.
[447:45.27]No, I'm saying, like, I don't gotta go, like, move to Hollywood and, like, start my acting career.
[447:51.12]I got this whole damn community.
[447:54.52]Why would I do that?
[447:59.63]Jeremiah can't act.
[448:00.31]Yes, I can.
[448:01.27]I can act circles around anybody you could possibly put me in front of.
[448:08.57]I'm talking anybody, especially stuff like Twitch, YouTube.
[448:12.65]You find me somebody on Twitch and YouTube that's a better actor than I am.
[448:17.97]I'll act anyone.
[448:19.37]And if you want to make it a competition, let's do it.
[448:22.33]Find me somebody that wants to be an actor.
[448:24.19]We'll have an acting composition in Las Vegas, in studio.
[448:28.54]Scripts, scenes.
[448:33.50]And I will destroy them all.
[448:36.60]It won't even be a competition.
[448:38.31]You guys, I'm gonna blow the fuck away.
[448:48.85]Give me something like, and you gotta give me something like real, real fucking heavy too.
[448:54.74]I'll be like a method actor.
[448:55.68]I'll fucking like smash something and fucking get like a lightning bolt.
[448:58.92]You'll hear me say all kinds of fucking swears.
[449:03.53]He's on his high horse now.
[449:04.85]No, I can out- I can out-act anybody.
[449:07.21]I'm certain of it.
[449:11.49]More like a meth actor.
[449:12.84]What the fuck?
[449:20.80]I'll show up in like a big scarf.
[449:23.14]And huge sunglasses.
[449:27.95]Drinking like a really tiny coffee.
[449:31.13]I will destroy them.
[449:40.73]Maybe one day.
[449:47.40]But thank you to Demonic Cucumber again for the $1.
[449:51.35]It's weird to hear that the bits minimum is going up.
[449:54.03]I'll be okay.
[449:55.49]I usually donate about $5 when I can.
[449:57.91]I suppose I'll have to make my messages more compact.
[450:00.96]I do worry about the others in the EU and those viewers everywhere else because bits are quite a bit more expensive in some parts of the world.
[450:08.22]But I'm sure we'd be happy to put less strain on you at the end of streams.
[450:11.66]Anyway, jermaHeart as usual, mind how you go, handsome boy.
[450:17.60]Yeah, I mean, it was not something that I just did for either no reason or because I take it lightly.
[450:25.21]Now, I don't want to increase minimums to read, but sometimes...
[450:32.80]You know, we have to make the stream... The stream still has to be, like, efficient, right?
[450:40.46]And as much as I would love to be able to hang out all night and read bits, as the channel grows, we have to keep the stream an efficient stream.
[450:48.89]We have to keep the stream rolling, and it gets late, right?
[450:52.91]Like, I mean, it's... The stream ended at... It's at about seven hours, right?
[451:05.36]So that was when the game was over, the broadcast was pretty much just like, alright, the game's done, the thing that I wanted to do tonight is done, and we're going to hang out for a little bit afterwards, right?
[451:15.05]But when it gets to a point where you've got like 7, 8, 9, 10 hours, there's two different options, right?
[451:21.93]There's either streamline it to go really fast and read names,
[451:28.40]And say, oh, thank you DemonicCucumber for the $1.
[451:30.44]Thank you Unconquerable for the $1.
[451:32.70]Thank you MostlyLost for the $1.
[451:35.00]Uh, Gambling Addiction Hotline.
[451:36.36]Oh, that's funny.
[451:37.44]Thank you Unconquerable for $1.
[451:38.50]Thank you Alex for the $10.
[451:40.22]You deserve something for that.
[451:41.12]I could blow through them.
[451:43.18]But that's not what the end of my streams... That's not what I want to do.
[451:49.72]So streamlining the end process and not bogging it down is the goal.
[452:04.28]Jerma doesn't know the entire community is Five Guys making fake accounts.
[452:11.05]As your audience grows, that will be harder.
[452:13.55]And, I mean, look, we have to face a, you know, a potential reality here.
[452:20.39]And that is, I'm not saying this is going to happen, but if it does, you look at some streams that have 3, 4, 5,000 concurrent viewers, 10,000 concurrent viewers.
[452:30.84]Sometimes some of these streams have 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,000 concurrent viewers.
[452:36.34]It's almost impossible to keep up.
[452:39.77]like actually impossible to keep up.
[452:42.45]So the reality is if the channel keeps growing and if the community keeps growing, these things are going to have to keep happening.
[452:52.13]Not to an extent of, I mean, I would never make like a bit reading minimum, but maybe the bit reading minimum changes or it doesn't happen anymore.
[452:59.04]Maybe, I don't know.
[453:00.76]I can't tell you that it's, I have no idea what's going to happen.
[453:03.54]All I can do is day to day, month to month, you know, by yearly, maybe like once every year or two, try to figure out solutions to keep the stream going in an efficient and streamlined and fun way.
[453:19.65]Because as much as people love this end of the stream portion of every single stream I do now, there are a lot of people that just leave, right?
[453:28.83]There are people that are just like, alright, he's gotten to the end of the stream, I'm out of here.
[453:32.47]And, you know, people will pop back in and be like, oh, wait, you're still streaming?
[453:37.11]It's been like three hours, you're still doing the end of the stream?
[453:46.63]Somebody just gave $50.
[453:47.83]AM Scoots, thanks for 50 bucks.
[453:49.21]And they say greedy streamer.
[453:54.71]But the thing at the end, thank you for the fucking $50.
[453:59.86]At the end of the day, I also have to take into consideration, you know, me, right?
[454:11.07]I'm the one that's sitting in the chair and talking, and I have to try to make it easy for me to do as well.
[454:19.68]And if the end of the stream, if the second stream ends up being a two, three, four hour experience after the stream is over, it can be hard to do that.
[454:33.02]You know, every stream can't be seven hours, eight hours of a stream, and then three, four hours for reading bits.
[454:46.41]And a lot of what... Somebody just mentioned it.
[454:49.05]VRJosh just mentioned it.
[454:50.07]Would you ever consider having text-to-speech donations?
[454:51.85]Absolutely not, never.
[454:52.89]It'll never happen on this channel.
[454:54.37]It will never happen.
[454:59.58]I cannot ever do it.
[455:02.80]Because I have the opinion that text-to-speech audio is, it kind of just gets in the way of the stream, like of the broadcast.
[455:15.03]That's just my opinion on it.
[455:16.33]That's just how I feel about it.
[455:17.57]I'm not saying that it's a wrong way to do your stream.
[455:21.19]It's just, I have, I can't pay attention to that.
[455:24.04]I can't be trying to do something over here and, oh, let me take a picture of like the rhino.
[455:28.40]And then all of a sudden, bang, somebody's like talking in my ear.
[455:33.56]I do much better when I have very little distractions because I'm so easily distracted anyways.
[455:43.21]And text-to-speech... What text-to-speech can sometimes do is turn a stream into a... Just everybody's just fucking writing random shit that's just going to be blasted out to a ton of people.
[456:01.02]So it's less about, hey, this person is streaming this game or this person is streaming this event or something and more just fall blasting some voice talking out loud to a bunch of people.
[456:24.37]But people run their communities the way that they want to, and that's fine.
[456:27.23]And I do see how, like, the fun in somebody having a system where you can just kind of be on stream.
[456:35.50]Like, that's kind of fucking fun.
[456:36.56]That's kind of cool.
[456:40.02]Having somebody pop up and just be, like, their name pops up, and this is them talking.
[456:45.70]And they can say, like, they can just, like, shitpost.
[456:47.50]They can say something funny.
[456:48.36]They can say something interesting.
[456:50.58]I understand that.
[456:58.22]But I don't think I'd ever want that on my stream.
[457:00.64]So I have to figure out other ways to interact with the community.
[457:08.22]I thought this was a decent idea, kind of just doing reading and hanging out at the end of a stream when I'm not going to get distracted by messages or sounds or noises or...
[457:23.41]And I felt like this solution was the best one.
[457:25.18]But this solution is so strange, I think, that it needs constant care to still work.
[457:34.38]So that's why things like minimums have to increase.
[457:37.63]That's why eventually maybe some other things might have to change about it as well.
[457:41.57]But I'm not going to cross any of those bridges until it's certain of what those things have to be.
[457:47.61]So at the end of the day, as of this weekend here, we are going up to $2.50.
[457:52.00]$2.50 to help streamline the end of the stream.
[458:07.79]And it was three.
[458:09.06]It was three.
[458:13.12]So I did bring it down back from three because of the way the bits are purchased.
[458:20.79]We'll keep going.
[458:21.31]We'll see.
[458:22.93]But thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[458:26.26]Thank you, Unconqueraby, for the $1.
[458:28.22]Shut up and play.
[458:28.90]I'm not sure what I was doing, but hopefully I shut up and played.
[458:33.10]Or maybe I didn't.
[458:36.78]Maybe I decided I wanted to do something else.
[458:42.66]Maybe if I didn't want to play and I wanted to just say something, maybe that's what I'm going to do.
[458:47.74]Maybe that's going to happen.
[458:52.91]But thank you.
[458:53.41]Thank you.
[458:53.73]Mostly lost for the $1.
[458:55.37]The National Gambling Addiction Hotline.
[458:56.83]Oh, there it is again.
[458:59.39]Keep that in mind whenever you go triple or nothing on a bet and lose within 30 seconds.
[459:02.95]I went triple or nothing and I won.
[459:08.80]Thank you, Onkogorobi, for the $1 again.
[459:10.60]I enjoyed watching this edition of Jerma985, the legend of the triple dog deer.
[459:15.05]Anyway, it's been a while, and I haven't donated in a bit.
[459:17.31]Glad I got to catch a bit of this stream before I slept.
[459:20.01]Can't wait for the next stream, and I hope you keep your gambling tendencies to a minimum.
[459:23.87]Much love, jermaHeart.
[459:24.79]Thank you.
[459:26.61]No, it was a lot of fun.
[459:28.97]I liked this game, and I liked this stream, and I liked this.
[459:31.63]It was fun.
[459:32.35]We had a good time.
[459:34.44]uh Alex Alex onyx thanks for the ten dollars you deserve something for that ten dollars apparently from Alex thank you unhealthy habits you guys act like I'm like I don't
[459:56.36]Like I got to make like gambling references.
[459:58.04]I live in Las Vegas, right?
[459:59.30]That's like a, that's an easy joke.
[460:01.96]I got so many easy gambling and casino references to make because I live here.
[460:06.42]That's like 75% of the reason why I moved here.
[460:09.84]So I can make casino reference jokes because like it's easy comedy.
[460:19.86]And if you believe that, you know, the fuck.
[460:25.50]But thank you, Alex.
[460:26.10]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the $1.
[460:27.92]You know the game has a lot of its... You know the game has lost its comedic value when the funniest thing you can do is be silent for 15 minutes.
[460:38.97]That was fun.
[460:39.79]That was fun.
[460:40.43]Hey, Jerma985, thanks for the 50 community subs, Jerma985.
[460:44.81]And then, ha ha ha, Kuma...
[460:49.16]Gave 50 as well, making the 100 community subs original bet be paid off completely.
[460:56.23]The debt has been cleared.
[460:58.05]Thank you so much.
[461:00.51]Thank you, Jerma.
[461:01.51]Thank you so much, man.
[461:04.55]Holy fuck.
[461:04.91]How much fucking money is that?
[461:05.95]How much money is that?
[461:06.53]How much fucking money is that shit?
[461:10.02]No.
[461:10.54]But thank you, ha ha ha.
[461:11.34]That was... You didn't have to do that.
[461:14.28]And you did, so thank you.
[461:16.28]pizza bot thanks for the five dollars pizza bot I'm pretty sure you almost hit enlightenment with being quiet for so long uh something or other thanks for the one dollar didn't make a business logo went with a shitty postcard instead yeah that works too that works too greetings from toronto welcome to Brazil what
[461:45.58]It does make a pretty good postcard.
[461:51.42]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[461:54.25]Mostly lost.
[461:54.85]Thanks for the $1.
[461:55.25]Also, please don't feel bad about missing my bits.
[461:58.39]It's really not a big deal.
[462:01.51]Yeah, but it was a lot of money.
[462:03.13]I don't ever want to bypass somebody's major, massive monetary contribution to the stream.
[462:11.27]You know, it's... I want to make sure that you know that I see it
[462:17.24]Because it's a lot of money.
[462:19.73]But thank you.
[462:20.57]Thank you, Flammable Cow, for the $10.
[462:22.49]May I suggest you play SpongeBob SquarePants Battle for Bikini Bottom?
[462:25.99]I was hovering over the purchase button, but I didn't buy it.
[462:29.75]Love the streams.
[462:30.23]You're a great guy.
[462:30.87]Keep doing you.
[462:33.74]I was going to buy SpongeBob SquarePants, but I didn't know what to do.
[462:38.88]There's like six PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nickelodeon, SpongeBob included games, and I didn't know which one was the one to buy.
[462:46.18]Is it Battle for Bikini Bottom?
[462:47.54]Is that the one?
[462:48.86]Is that the one that I'm going to beat on stream?
[462:52.46]Is that The Simpsons Hit and Run 2 where I play that game for like a 12-hour session and beat the whole game?
[463:00.41]Is that an angry game?
[463:01.41]Am I going to get mad at that game?
[463:09.41]No?
[463:09.89]Is it just fun?
[463:10.51]Am I gonna get actually... Is that a game where you have to be picture perfect?
[463:18.63]Yeah, Nicktoons Unite is one that I saw.
[463:21.65]I was gonna get it.
[463:25.06]Did you actually beat Hit and Run?
[463:26.36]Oh, yeah.
[463:27.76]I did it in one stream.
[463:28.90]I sat there for like 13 hours and did the whole thing.
[463:33.48]I probably lost a handful of brain cells doing it, but I still did it.
[463:42.44]But yeah, you'll probably see that at some point soon.
[463:47.52]Silver Catalyst, thanks for the $5, Silver Catalyst.
[463:50.72]Hey, Jerm, I've been watching you for around five years, but only recently been watching your streams, and it's phenomenal how much joy you bring to me.
[463:56.97]Love your content.
[463:58.49]Also, have you seen this rhythm game called Osu?
[464:01.43]Someone mapped Rat's birthday mixtape, and it's one of the hardest maps ever full comboed.
[464:07.27]I think somebody linked this before.
[464:10.42]Yeah, I remember this.
[464:14.35]So hold on a second.
[464:15.07]Do I have the hardest level in osu?
[464:16.63]Do I have the hardest level in the game?
[464:26.58]No?
[464:29.04]This is 655pp.
[464:31.16]What's that mean?
[464:40.04]Am I in like the top 50 hardest levels in the game?
[464:44.66]This is a rhythm game, right?
[464:53.06]655 is really high, actually.
[464:54.08]Really.
[464:55.28]That's cool.
[464:55.84]I think we watched that once before.
[464:58.05]But... No, that's really cool.
[465:03.93]Hardest game for, like, the streamer that plays.
[465:05.73]Like, the hardest games.
[465:06.81]And, like, it's really focused and gets the job done on stream.
[465:09.69]That's what I say.
[465:19.15]Is there a RATS mixtape map in Beat Saber?
[465:21.57]I think there is.
[465:22.01]I think somebody showed it to us a while ago.
[465:26.18]PP is the scoring system.
[465:27.38]It's one of the hardest maps DW.
[465:31.82]Alright.
[465:33.44]Well, that's crazy.
[465:37.20]Thank you to the $5 Servo Catalyst, and thanks for the...
[465:41.53]Thanks for the video.
[465:43.35]Hey, good luck on all you osu!
[465:44.65]players.
[465:45.42]I think you can beat the rats mixtape level.
[465:47.32]It's the hardest level in the game.
[465:48.76]Good luck.
[465:51.40]Uh, Yuri... Yoripiterida.
[465:55.08]Yoripiterida.
[465:56.40]Thanks for the $1.
[465:57.58]College is stressful, but your streams always brighten my day.
[465:59.60]Jerma heart.
[466:00.80]Gonna be a vet tech when I'm done with this.
[466:02.76]Awesome.
[466:04.50]Told you guys this before.
[466:05.34]If I wasn't a streamer or a tuber, either one, I would probably go into the veterinary field somewhere to do with animals.
[466:14.87]I would own a backyard with a bunch of fucking acres of land and I have an elephant.
[466:21.11]I don't know how to pronounce it either.
[466:22.47]Okay, good.
[466:22.91]That's good.
[466:28.03]But, yeah.
[466:29.59]And then we have $2 from Garfield the Monday Killer.
[466:33.39]We've got two very large garfographs here.
[466:39.98]Why am I even saying the word garfograph?
[466:42.76]It's a paragraph.
[466:43.58]Don't call it a garfograph.
[466:46.65]Hey there, Jerma.
[466:47.17]Long time no bits.
[466:47.93]Garf has been out on a Himalayan expedition of magnificent magnitude.
[466:52.06]Still murdering Mondays as usual.
[466:54.72]But a whole lot of toony business I had to take care of.
[466:57.74]Dick Dastardly and Muttly even stole all of Garf's bucks.
[467:01.48]And I had to team up with Twitch staff in order to put those villains behind bars.
[467:04.96]How was your Valentine's, Jerma?
[467:06.04]Garf had a surprisingly good one despite the Monday-like breakup of a few months ago.
[467:10.10]My two gal pals...
[467:11.74]And I made a sorry I ran out of space on the last Garfagraph.
[467:15.31]Hehe.
[467:16.03]Anyway, we all... We went out and did sweet things for one another.
[467:19.85]We may not be romantically interested, but just hanging out with two good pals is just as Garfy.
[467:24.97]In case you want to know who they are, it was Korra from Avatar and Sombra from Overwatch.
[467:30.51]Okay.
[467:31.23]Yeah, Garf hangs out with Sombra for some reason.
[467:33.89]That sounds like a funny LARPing cartoon joke, but those two actually go to conventions as those characters.
[467:39.09]They're very... They're...
[467:55.89]Thank you, Garfield, for the $2.
[468:00.61]I'm glad you're doing well.
[468:03.81]Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[468:04.85]Cox has delayed this, but here's my $100 message.
[468:07.37]Thank you, Tingy.
[468:09.30]Yeah, sorry about the stream dying after like an hour and 40 minutes a few days ago.
[468:12.78]It was not my intention.
[468:14.70]I'm sorry that some people got left in the dust there.
[468:17.44]So thank you so much for the huge amount of money.
[468:22.27]This $2.50 increase is going to cut into Garfield's savings.
[468:31.26]GoldRubyProduction, thanks for the $1.
[468:33.70]How is Shito doing?
[468:35.92]Hope he is well.
[468:36.92]Shito is doing great.
[468:38.89]He's been asleep for, like, seven days.
[468:41.55]That's typically how it works.
[468:42.39]You know how a camel only has to eat or drink, like, once every two weeks?
[468:47.55]Well, Shido is like a camel.
[468:49.59]Instead of eating, he sleeps for, like, two weeks.
[468:52.31]And then gets up and eats some dog food.
[468:56.59]His favorite.
[468:59.29]Wakes up and plays himself as an instrument.
[469:02.04]He talks.
[469:04.74]That sounded really bad.
[469:06.58]Uh...
[469:09.62]If a pet is sleeping for seven days, it means it's dead.
[469:25.11]That's so terrible.
[469:25.99]Yeah, he's been sleeping for seven days.
[469:31.12]Thank you, Gold.
[469:33.78]Ruby Production.
[469:34.36]Cheeto's doing just fine.
[469:37.05]anything else show official thanks for the six bucks even thought about playing new Vegas with mods I know you played new Vegas but the stream was pretty great I thought with mods it would be funnier also you're amazing well that means that's incredibly nice thing to say about somebody thank you for that and to answer the question not now not now revisiting old stuff or games that I played before and adding new content is something that I
[470:06.11]Something that we need to go back to eventually.
[470:08.85]Maybe.
[470:11.68]Because it needs to be out of my brain completely.
[470:13.72]I know it's been a few years.
[470:18.41]But it might be worth doing.
[470:20.47]The thing is, though, once you do mods, once I do, like, fucking mods, the game is just forever, I can never go back, ever again.
[470:28.38]It happened with Skyrim, it happened with... Did I do that in Oblivion?
[470:32.18]I did not do it with Oblivion, I did it with Skyrim, and I never went back and played Skyrim the same way ever again.
[470:37.90]So, putting a bunch of, like, crazy, fun, interesting mods into, um, New Vegas... Oh my god.
[470:51.04]Another $50 from Amscoods.
[470:52.96]$100 total from Amscoods.
[470:54.66]I take it back.
[470:55.14]You're not a greedy streamer with a smiley face.
[470:59.25]Hey, thanks.
[471:01.51]Thank you for the $100.
[471:05.49]That's a ton of money.
[471:10.51]But, yeah.
[471:11.29]I'm not opposed to the idea.
[471:13.74]That does sound fun.
[471:17.26]Thank you, Dorkcube, for the one dollar.
[471:18.55]How does Garfield always know exactly what to write in order to confuse Jeremy?
[471:24.87]Well, it's not, like, confusing.
[471:26.19]It's just, like... It's just, like, two paragraphs of... Of just, like, stuff that isn't even real.
[471:34.25]It's just, like, huge strings of shit that's not even real.
[471:38.87]It's just, like, talking about, like, John and going, like, grocery store shopping and...
[471:48.79]Hey, speaking of Garfield, the Monday killer, thanks for the $1.
[471:52.19]I actually stopped donating bits to give Jerma a break from my garfer graphs, but that last reading might have been one of the hardest he struggled to get through it.
[472:00.89]Oh my gosh, Jerma, I'm so sorry.
[472:02.46]Please don't hate the garf.
[472:03.62]He just wants to make you laugh.
[472:07.14]Take that back, you fuck.
[472:11.60]No, I gotta give pauses between...
[472:14.79]Statements.
[472:15.97]Cause I'm rea- I'm gonna copy and paste that cause that's a- that's a- oh wait wait I need to paste that.
[472:21.19]Look.
[472:21.95]Look.
[472:23.19]See?
[472:25.58]I- this is me quoting Dorkcube.
[472:33.94]But thank you Garfield.
[472:35.11]No, it's- you- the stuff you say is fucking funny.
[472:37.87]I just- it's hard for me to follow.
[472:40.07]There's so much going on in like the Garfield lore.
[472:47.61]But thank you so much, Garfield.
[472:51.05]What happened to the music?
[472:55.29]I need you to laugh at my joke.
[472:58.59]Poor Garfield.
[472:59.39]No, everybody loves Garfield.
[473:01.60]Well, nobody likes Garfield.
[473:03.36]But the fake Garfield that's not the real Garfield is in this community.
[473:07.80]And everybody loves the fake Garfield.
[473:11.86]More like Dumbna985.
[473:17.70]Why is it people get me to try to read the same thing?
[473:21.90]Please laugh at this.
[473:23.12]Why would I laugh at that?
[473:29.91]What?
[473:32.45]This is the real Garfield.
[473:33.67]This is not the real Garfield.
[473:35.39]This is the better Garfield.
[473:38.29]This is like the original Garfield when he used to be fat and funny.
[473:41.73]Instead of like a plush toy that has a cartoon.
[473:49.36]Garfield the Monday Killer with a dollar.
[473:50.78]What are you talking about, Jerma?
[473:52.44]I'm the real Garfield.
[473:53.40]Come on, folks.
[473:54.31]Give Jerma a round of applause.
[473:55.53]What a funny Garfster.
[474:02.21]And this is the video.
[474:07.44]Yes, I'm here.
[474:08.36]What is your wish?
[474:09.38]Do you eat ass?
[474:10.60]Of course I do.
[474:12.44]That was the Will Smith genie.
[474:17.62]Do you eat ass?
[474:27.64]Oh man.
[474:33.73]There it is.
[474:38.01]Alright, I'm going to make a prediction.
[474:43.24]You ready?
[474:44.38]If I... We're going to Price is Right this.
[474:48.12]Or at least like over, under a little bit here.
[474:50.54]Okay.
[474:51.64]The Aladdin live action movie.
[474:55.18]will have within five percentile 28 on rotten tomatoes okay so that means if it's anywhere within five twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty thirty three twenty eight twenty seven twenty six twenty five twenty four twenty three twenty eight percent if I get it dead on then I get the jackpot
[475:22.90]If the live action Aladdin has a higher Rotten Tomatoes than Venom, I'll be very surprised.
[475:30.98]What is Venom at right now?
[475:33.94]I think it's like 32, right?
[475:37.46]29, okay, 29% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.
[475:39.54]28%, see you in like three weeks.
[475:50.56]Wait, when does that movie come out?
[475:52.44]Like next year?
[475:59.22]I have no idea.
[476:03.06]But thank you, Garfield.
[476:05.20]And thank you.
[476:05.96]That was awesome.
[476:08.24]I believe we're not awesome.
[476:09.66]Awesome Tris for that video.
[476:13.86]And finally, two more here.
[476:14.88]Dorkcube, thanks for the $1.
[476:16.78]You're making me mad, mister.
[476:17.96]Stop saying Garfield isn't real.
[476:19.24]He is real.
[476:19.68]I know it.
[476:20.56]He eats lasagna, and lasagna is real.
[476:22.47]Explain that.
[476:25.87]Lasagna is like as if somebody took a fucking textbook, wet all the pages, and in between each page put a bunch of cheese and sauce, and then put it in the fucking oven.
[476:50.80]When did I tell you it didn't taste good?
[476:52.50]I didn't tell you it didn't taste good.
[476:53.98]When did I say that?
[476:55.48]When did I say that lasagna is bad?
[476:57.86]When did I say that lasagna is not tasty?
[477:00.86]It's just a textbook that has been wet and put in the oven and cheese all over it.
[477:05.49]It's still good.
[477:06.09]Oh, he's getting political again.
[477:18.65]Guys, I love lasagna.
[477:19.85]I'm fucking kidding.
[477:26.00]I actually haven't eaten lasagna in probably five years.
[477:29.82]That's a real 5% statement.
[477:33.97]I have not eaten lasagna in five years.
[477:39.21]If I'm going to have lasagna, I just want chicken parm instead.
[477:44.03]No, that's not a lie.
[477:44.87]I have not had lasagna.
[477:45.87]I have not eaten lasagna, maybe even in ten years.
[477:56.60]I don't think I have... I don't think so.
[478:01.08]Fettuccine Alfredo.
[478:03.21]I want that.
[478:04.81]Lasagna.
[478:05.55]Is that on the menu?
[478:06.85]No.
[478:07.01]What else is on the menu?
[478:07.93]Anything else?
[478:08.29]Okay.
[478:08.63]I'm not going to order lasagna.
[478:11.95]Nobody even... You can't even order lasagna at a restaurant.
[478:15.07]You have to make lasagna.
[478:22.70]What restaurant has lasagna on the menu?
[478:30.65]I've never seen, like, just default lasagna at an Italian restaurant.
[478:39.57]The Olive Garden?

[482:01.53]Olive Garden does not count.
[482:05.61]No, Olive Garden doesn't count.
[482:07.67]Olive Garden is not an Italian restaurant.
[482:10.97]Olive Garden is like the subway of Italian restaurants.
[482:30.22]What's wrong with Subway?
[482:33.55]They're going under.
[482:36.75]I got some real, real bad news for all you Subway fans.
[482:39.91]I don't see that company still existing in like 20 years.
[482:46.44]And they're taking all the lasagna with them.
[483:00.04]Feels bad, man.
[483:01.80]It's because they don't have lasagna.
[483:03.47]It's the first time I've ever seen lasagna on a menu.
[483:07.87]I swear to God.
[483:16.32]I'm okay with that.
[483:24.76]I've never I've never I haven't had it.
[483:26.55]I haven't eaten lasagna in five fucking years.
[483:28.83]I'm not kidding.
[483:29.67]I swear So wait am I hearing right that lasagna is also not Italian is it hold on a minute
[483:53.68]Where does lasagna come from?
[483:55.44]Italy.
[484:01.47]Lasagna in Italy, at least, has never been an everyday dish.
[484:06.11]Those delicate sheets of fresh egg pasta, the complex sauces and ingredients for the filling, it'd be a momentous occasion to be with all that work.
[484:16.57]That's why in the North, lasagna is not even, they don't even need it there.
[484:38.08]Lasagna.
[484:39.58]Alright, I'm sorry man, but like, like... I mean, that looks like as appetizing as a catcher's mitt.
[485:09.63]Somebody worked hard on that.
[485:11.15]It's not their fault.
[485:12.07]Lasagna just looks like that.
[485:15.70]Lasagna just looks like cat puke.
[485:24.28]That's not... Look, you can make the best lasagna in the world.
[485:27.95]It tastes good.
[485:29.05]It's not... But it looks like a catcher's mitt.
[485:33.11]Ugh.
[485:40.69]Lasagna.
[485:43.77]Oh, Garfield, what have you done?
[485:50.31]What if your mother made you lasagna?
[485:51.73]Would you say it looked like cat puke?
[485:53.49]No, I would eat it and I would think it was delicious.
[485:58.37]Guys, it's pasta sheets, a bunch of cheese, and a ton of sauce.
[486:04.14]That doesn't taste bad.
[486:08.61]There's nothing wrong with it.
[486:10.15]It's... That's all it is.
[486:16.62]It's pizza with doughier bread.
[486:22.26]At least we don't eat canned tuna.
[486:23.92]I'm banning this guy.
[486:25.50]How do I do that?
[486:28.00]I just gifted them a sub.
[486:30.00]Alright, hold on.
[486:48.23]Yeah, get fucking banned.
[486:49.33]Yeah, get banned.
[487:13.90]Like, that's really close to ban person.
[487:16.91]There's, like, add friend, whisper, gift a sub, and then, like, right there is also ban.
[487:21.83]Like, ban is not even two inches away from gift sub.
[487:40.25]Alright, now I'm actually, now I'm gonna ban you.
[487:42.56]You're gonna get banned for, like, a day.
[487:47.44]Alright, it's time to go.
[487:48.88]I gotta get out of here.
[487:51.12]Lasagna tastes great.
[487:52.06]It's delicious.
[487:53.20]It's wonderful.
[487:56.79]It's just... It's not on Italian menu.
[488:00.81]It's on Olive Garden and like Fridays.
[488:03.53]Secret menu.
[488:04.15]You gotta order from the secret menu.
[488:08.51]Jerma, please laugh.
[488:09.31]Please, just pretend to laugh at my joke.
[488:12.28]I need your Boston laughs.
[488:14.50]What was the joke?
[488:15.96]Wait, what are you spamming this for?
[488:25.61]You can take the sub back.
[488:27.27]I can't take the sub back.
[488:28.37]I'm not going to ban you.
[488:30.59]Why would I ban you?
[488:34.26]Did I just give you like a three month sub?
[488:40.60]Wow.
[488:40.84]Okay, I'm loud.
[488:41.86]Alright.
[488:44.20]I did it.
[488:50.59]Subway isn't going under.
[488:51.79]It's going to happen.
[488:59.79]Does that work?
[489:02.65]Jerma985 has gifted a... No, it was Tier 1.
[489:05.55]I see it in how you streamlet.
[489:08.39]More like Uglyma985.
[489:10.44]Like that?
[489:17.92]Hey, Q-double-D-double-D-Q-4, thanks for the $1.
[489:20.64]They say meatball... What is this?
[489:22.15]This is not a real website.
[489:24.53]Hey, Dorkube, thanks for the $1.
[489:25.94]Get fucked.
[489:26.86]Lasagna Classico for the goddamn win.
[489:29.42]I didn't, I like lasagna.
[489:31.76]This is just, this is a bullshit article that was written about me in chat, how I don't like lasagna.
[489:37.62]I said it was delicious, I said it was full of delicious flavors, and that I love, I would eat it.
[489:43.03]When did I ever say that?
[489:48.06]Azazasalt, thanks for the $1.
[489:49.76]A while ago you mentioned wanting a short co-op game to play with Etalyx.
[489:53.43]I recommend Monaco.
[489:54.93]What's yours is mine.
[489:55.61]It's a co-op heist game that I think would be great stream material.
[490:04.10]Uh, I've actually heard of that game.
[490:07.84]We were looking at stuff, uh, recently.
[490:10.16]Some, like, PS3 stuff maybe we could do together.
[490:11.86]Because we have all these old consoles.
[490:14.86]But, Dorkube, thanks for the one dollar.
[490:16.30]You're making me mad, Mr. Stop saying Garfield isn't real.
[490:18.82]I thought this was a lasagna thing again.
[490:21.91]Alright, look at the source.
[490:23.37]Zazasalt says, Someone's mom made this and now she's crying.
[490:30.77]But did you not hear my statement about how all lasagna looks like that?
[490:36.70]Gordon Ramsay could make a lasagna and it would still look like that.
[490:42.05]That's just what lasagna is.
[490:55.32]It's just a ton of layered sheets of pasta and sauce all over it with a shitload of cheese stuffed in it.
[491:04.82]I'll make it on stream.
[491:06.62]It's... I can do it.
[491:07.50]Uh, last two here.
[491:11.00]Thank you, Juno.
[491:12.54]Uh, Septo for the three bucks.
[491:14.32]Thanks for the stream.
[491:14.88]I don't know why I couldn't stop laughing at a man literally not talking or emoting whatsoever for ten minutes.
[491:20.06]It's hard.
[491:22.20]But thank you.
[491:23.59]Glad to have you.
[491:24.92]Q-W-W-Q-4, thanks for the $1.
[491:27.30]It's the menu for Spaghetti Warehouse.
[491:31.04]Don't be mean to lasagna.
[491:34.78]Lasagna.
[491:38.69]But thank you, guys.
[491:40.71]Let's take a look at these.
[491:41.37]There's going to be a shitload of subs that scroll up here really fast.
[491:43.93]Because as you know, there were a ton of community subs.
[491:49.37]And here they come.
[491:50.59]Thank you, everybody.
[491:51.05]Thank you.
[491:53.58]General, please tell me a bedtime story that'll help me sleep.
[491:57.16]Once there was a young prince that lived in a castle.
[492:05.49]He was really, really good at Fortnite.
[492:08.73]So one day he got the Victory Royale in Fortnite.
[492:17.45]I'm really rusty on these, aren't I?
[492:31.26]Is it?
[492:31.48]I'm mentioning Fortnite.
[492:35.03]I said Fortnite and then it threw me off.
[492:37.63]This is lagging.
[492:38.25]It's going so fast.
[492:44.59]That was a shitty story.
[492:45.41]Tell us a better one.
[492:47.81]It was a shitty story.
[492:49.27]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[492:53.11]It was a shitty story.
[492:54.37]Blah, blah, blah.
[492:57.22]You want a better one?
[492:57.72]Fine.
[492:58.12]Okay, how about this one?
[492:59.06]This one's called, um...
[493:02.43]I'm just gonna come up with more on the fly here.
[493:06.23]Okay, so you got a... Okay, how about... Sorry, I got a decent one.
[493:13.58]We got a... A spawn, because we were just doing stuff about animals.
[493:18.38]A fawn was racing in the forest, okay?
[493:22.54]He was ahead of a rabbit.
[493:24.12]A rabbit was very fast coming through.
[493:26.78]He was ahead of the elephant.
[493:28.24]You know, the fawn is faster than the elephant.
[493:29.62]The fawn is faster than the rabbit.
[493:32.56]He leapt and cleared the stream.
[493:34.61]He ran past the crumbling wall of dirt.
[493:39.83]There was a large boulder on the grassy plain.
[493:42.01]He stumbled and fell down.
[493:44.74]He burst into tears and the monkey massaged his leg.
[493:49.62]Tears flowed from the fawn's eyes.
[493:53.48]A brother bear picked him up.
[493:54.80]The fawn didn't stop crying.
[493:56.80]His mother came.
[493:57.48]She said, look, we'll beat up this bad boulder.
[494:01.52]The fawn said, oh, don't do that.
[494:02.90]Then the boulder will also start crying.
[494:04.68]His mother laughed.
[494:05.44]So did the fawn.
[494:06.85]That's the story.
[494:14.97]10 more community subs just came in.
[494:19.52]What's the moral of the story?
[494:20.36]I don't know.
[494:20.74]I don't have any fucking idea what the moral of this story is.
[494:29.68]It's a cute story that's told by some kid or something.
[494:31.91]I don't know.
[494:33.61]Amscoots, 10 community subs.
[494:38.33]Thank you, Amscoots.
[494:42.09]Really appreciate it.
[494:42.83]It's a lot.
[494:46.81]Was this story generated by an AI?
[494:49.87]I don't think so.
[494:52.69]And those of you that want to, like... This is a children's book, right?
[494:57.24]Was my book better than this book?
[495:01.46]This book... This is a book.
[495:03.86]This book was originally published.
[495:07.28]This is a published book.
[495:10.22]This is exactly what I was... See, the person just did the... They did fawn racing in forest.
[495:16.58]And then they made this up.
[495:22.95]They had the random number generator.
[495:32.44]Are you still on the children's book joke?
[495:34.78]Yeah, then we've been going this whole time.
[495:37.85]I've been streaming for like four days straight.
[495:40.25]I've written like five books.
[495:46.59]But that's gonna be it.
[495:48.19]Thank you everybody for hanging out.
[495:50.63]Again, I'm not entirely sure what tomorrow is going to hold, so tentative that I'll be live tomorrow.
[495:58.79]But the next time that I am live, whether it's tomorrow or a day from now, we will be doing Vive.
[496:05.90]I'm gonna get into it, I'm gonna get started.
[496:08.16]I'll see you when I see you.
[496:09.30]The sus is probably gonna be weird or inaccurate for a day or two.
[496:14.63]So I'll be here tomorrow afternoon to let you guys know what's happening.
[496:18.77]So regardless if I stream or not tomorrow, I'll be here at around like 2, 2.30 tomorrow just to let everybody know what's going to happen.
[496:26.34]Or maybe I'll make a tweet or something.
[496:27.50]I'll just check my socials, you know?
[496:31.40]Have a great night.
[496:32.10]Thanks for hanging out.
[496:32.69]It was a blast as always.
[496:35.29]See you guys soon.
