[00:29.01]Hey.
[00:31.05]How you doing?
[00:34.28]Hi, guys.
[00:40.14]I'm Jeremy.
[00:41.72]Welcome to my stream.
[00:43.76]It's kind of a small house.
[00:45.38]It's a small stream here.
[00:46.38]I have a fridge.
[00:50.78]Stove.
[00:52.30]PlayStation.
[00:55.79]Yeah.
[00:56.93]Tonight is going to be a...
[00:59.58]Interesting stream.
[01:03.38]Because I'm going to be playing with Kryken and Kroo.
[01:06.99]I'm going to be playing Sub Rosa tonight.
[01:12.61]Yeah, we started pretty late.
[01:15.61]Kryken and his buds don't usually start streaming until 10pm.
[01:22.08]But because I'm an East Coast guy, we brought it down to about 9pm, so here we are.
[01:28.57]And I think we're gonna get started.
[01:30.59]Like last time, we played Zoombinis for like three hours.
[01:33.51]I'm pretty sure we're ready to go.
[01:37.21]Give me one second.
[01:38.09]Let me just make sure everything's ready to go.
[01:39.23]One sec.
[02:03.20]I have no idea what's going on.
[02:04.24]I'm just in here.
[02:06.74]Subrosa's game where you play and there's cars and it's really physics-based and wonky.
[02:12.46]It's like GTA Roblox where you fall over a lot.
[02:16.58]I guess.
[02:18.96]We're gonna give it a try.
[02:19.92]We're gonna see what happens.
[02:23.54]Make sure we're all in here.

[13:55.79]One person is responsible for the floppy disk.
[13:57.79]One person is responsible for the briefcase.
[14:01.04]No, you put the floppy disk in the briefcase.
[14:04.74]That's what they want me to think.
[14:07.46]Put it in.
[14:09.23]Oh, I like the way you think, boy.
[14:11.04]I don't think this guy knows how to talk.
[14:14.28]If you can't put the disc in the briefcase.
[14:17.24]Damn it.
[14:18.66]Fuck.
[14:21.48]The disc goes in.
[14:22.98]Do I have to fucking do everything?

[14:39.07]Put it in there.
[14:39.75]Why don't you just put it in the case there?
[14:42.57]I like to wear it as jewelry.
[14:43.69]It's not jewelry.
[14:48.19]See, apparently I'm the boss.
[14:50.86]What?
[14:52.16]How do you do this?

[15:01.00]Why do you think I have this boss boy?
[15:03.16]All right, I got it.
[15:03.66]It's in the briefcase.

[15:17.89]Thank you very much.
[15:19.89]I'm proud to be a Goldman, a fellow Goldman, and I'm a good driver.
[15:24.13]All right.
[15:25.15]Give somebody a call, please.
[15:29.03]This might be sexual harassment, but I'm proud to be here.
[15:31.41]Come on.
[15:31.66]We're going to get moving or what?
[15:34.62]He just had a drive.
[15:35.32]Yeah.
[15:40.58]The Goldmans take Manhattan.
[15:42.30]They made a Muppet movie about this.
[15:44.10]I want to be able to listen to them in conversation.
[15:54.62]This is fucking freaking me out.
[15:56.08]You alright?
[15:57.04]You got something to say?
[16:00.53]You make me... Okay.
[16:02.19]Take a right.
[16:02.93]Why?
[16:03.19]Wipe that smirk off your face right now.
[16:05.53]Okay, we'll be in there.
[16:06.79]I just made partner.
[16:08.24]Right.
[16:09.60]Fuck you.
[16:10.10]See that burger?
[16:11.34]The floating burger in the sky.
[16:12.74]That guy.
[16:13.28]That guy, you'll be hearing... HR will be hearing about you.
[16:16.32]Hey, hey, I'm sorry.
[16:17.98]I'm sorry.
[16:19.10]What?
[16:20.69]What did you say?
[16:22.23]I said I'm sorry.
[16:23.23]Hey.
[16:23.78]That doesn't matter.
[16:24.68]Sorry it's not going to save your job.
[16:28.39]There's still the briefcase.
[16:32.71]Well, your dad, your dad pays like shit.
[16:35.91]So that's all right with me.
[16:42.24]He didn't, he called me not a true Goldman.
[16:45.40]You know how much that sucks hearing that?
[16:46.96]That is exactly quote what you said.
[16:53.75]I would never say something like that.
[16:55.79]They're not answering me.
[16:57.99]Should I just throw the briefcase?
[16:59.21]Oh, hey.
[17:00.27]No, don't!
[17:04.70]Oh, I think we won.
[17:06.14]Give me the cases.
[17:07.76]Why?
[17:08.86]What was the point of that?
[17:14.65]Oh, my God.
[17:16.25]Wait, was that a decoy?
[17:18.05]I forgot to buy a gun, guys.
[17:23.29]Wait, we have to buy guns?
[17:24.99]Since when do we have to buy guns?
[17:26.89]Whoa!
[17:29.13]Somebody drive!
[17:29.83]Somebody drive the car!
[17:31.60]Somebody drive the car!
[17:35.26]We still have our briefcase.
[17:36.50]We're fine.
[17:44.20]Do I have the briefcase?
[17:46.08]I do.
[17:46.80]That's alright.
[17:47.22]I still have the document.
[17:54.17]This is so loud.
[17:56.91]It's alright.
[17:57.23]We got all the briefcases.
[17:58.18]That's all we need.
[18:01.42]This is like no rhyme or reason for this whole game.
[18:08.14]Get in!
[18:08.40]Get in!
[18:08.70]Are you holding a microphone?
[18:11.84]Are you doing a bit on TV?
[18:13.14]Are you a live newscaster?
[18:24.12]Alright, let's get some, let's get some action here.
[18:26.09]This fucking car is so loud.
[18:32.75]Easy, easy, easy!
[18:34.03]Is he dead?
[18:37.33]I thought he died.
[18:50.76]Why is everything louder for German than it is for us?
[18:53.42]Because it is.
[18:54.98]I don't know why.
[19:00.30]I think we might... We might need to reverse a little.
[19:04.88]Yeah, we might need to get out of this traffic.
[19:06.76]I can't hear anything!
[19:12.62]I got it, boss.
[19:13.28]I got it.
[19:18.24]Give them a call and find out where they are.
[19:25.35]We still got the briefcase, don't worry.
[19:26.67]Everything's fine.
[19:30.63]Who am I talking to?
[19:34.53]I'm about to jump out of the car.
[19:39.21]Too many vacuum cleaners.
[19:40.37]Am I right?
[19:42.75]Well, you're gonna... I'm gonna splatter you on my windshield if you get in my way, boy.
[19:47.01]You good?
[19:47.79]Yeah.
[19:48.69]It's on him.
[19:52.14]I'm not even sure where we're supposed to be going.
[19:55.36]Where are we heading?
[19:57.06]I know, right?
[19:57.96]Not there.
[19:59.22]Just keep driving in a circle.
[20:00.30]They'll never know where we're coming from.
[20:02.94]Just like ants.
[20:03.94]That's how ants fight.
[20:08.19]They circle around each other like ferrets.
[20:12.33]Hang on, I've got another call.
[20:13.73]Hang on.
[20:15.37]Hello, this is Goldman.
[20:21.03]Alright, who's on that line?
[20:22.81]Hey, I'm at the car.
[20:25.63]Guys, come on.
[20:26.75]I hear something.
[20:29.13]Somebody's yelling.
[20:31.01]Mike, do I hear you and your stupid friend?
[20:33.53]Right now?
[20:34.10]Somebody's nearby.
[20:35.02]Come on, get out of the car.
[20:37.36]Hey.
[20:38.46]Hey, you need it on the phone.
[20:39.54]Am I hearing you right now?
[20:41.30]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:41.96]You're hearing me.
[20:42.42]I'm sorry.
[20:43.80]We're supposed to sound briefcases.
[20:45.62]Okay, let's go up.
[20:47.12]That's what I wanted.
[20:49.11]Alright, let's make an even trade.
[20:55.41]Easy on the stairs, it's hard.
[20:57.91]Oh, shit.
[20:59.41]See them over there?
[21:00.93]We need binoculars.
[21:02.33]Why can we hear them from so far away?
[21:05.95]Fuck you!
[21:17.57]Hold your fire.
[21:18.33]Don't shoot.
[21:18.79]Don't shoot.
[21:19.13]Don't shoot.
[21:22.21]I'm Goldman.
[21:25.91]I'll fuck your business into the ground.
[21:28.37]I'm Goldman.
[21:29.19]Goldman, you're the only one with a gun.
[21:30.81]I just want to make sure you know that.
[21:31.97]Give him a call.
[21:36.63]Do you think they know that our briefcases are empty?
[21:39.40]Can we make a deal?
[21:41.20]Well, my briefcase is full.
[21:42.54]Oh, it's Goldman.
[21:45.08]Oh, mine's empty.
[21:47.88]Let's do a switcheroo.
[21:50.20]Alright, so here.
[21:51.26]You got the empty one?
[21:51.96]Here, switch that one with me.
[21:54.29]We have the disc.
[21:54.89]We have the red disc.
[22:18.62]What color disc do you have?
[22:20.82]It's a red disc.
[22:22.46]Uh, excuse me.
[22:23.22]That's not, that's not possible.
[22:26.40]We have math blasters.
[22:27.66]Do you have number crunchers in there?
[22:29.13]No.
[22:30.29]Which 1990s video game do you have for PC?
[22:32.75]We have the red disc.
[22:34.59]Show him it.
[22:35.63]Show him the good.
[22:37.17]Show him it.
[22:37.83]Hold on a minute.
[22:39.97]Show him.
[22:42.01]We have the disc.
[22:43.19]We have it right here.
[22:44.95]We got fucking number munchers up here.
[22:48.70]Let's just wait.
[22:49.34]Everybody calm down.
[22:50.60]Let's all just go home.
[22:52.42]Let's call it a day.
[22:54.74]That didn't work apparently.
[22:57.35]Good try though.
[22:58.21]It was a good attempt.
[23:12.21]He's still alive!
[23:17.92]Okay, so now that we got that out of our system... Wait, hold on, don't forget number marchers!
[23:33.05]What's in here?
[23:34.47]Ah shit, it's empty.
[23:43.63]Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[23:45.03]I'm okay.
[23:45.73]I'm fine.
[23:46.53]I'm alright.
[23:47.88]I'm alright.
[23:48.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[23:49.10]I got number munchers.
[23:49.82]I got number munchers.
[23:50.46]I am not a threat.
[23:55.86]Inside this briefcase is one of the most classic 1988 PC games ever made.
[24:11.29]All right.
[24:11.99]Now give us the disc.
[24:13.31]Wait a minute.
[24:13.79]Hold on.
[24:14.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:16.23]Okay.
[24:18.55]Hey, whoa.
[24:19.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:20.53]I know.
[24:20.85]I know.
[24:21.13]Just wait.
[24:21.47]Just wait.
[24:22.91]You got something that I want.
[24:24.90]Yeah.
[24:26.38]Are you in a position to negotiate right now?
[24:28.80]I am because I'm the one holding the briefcase.
[24:30.56]Let's see him out.
[24:31.16]What do you want?
[24:32.68]Okay.
[24:32.80]What do you want?
[24:33.50]You understand?
[24:33.90]Like, I have all the power here.
[24:35.46]I got the briefcase.
[24:36.38]Do you have a briefcase?
[24:37.24]No.
[24:37.93]I mean, but we have the disc, too.
[24:42.91]Do you have a briefcase?
[24:46.15]Don't we?
[24:46.57]Can someone pick that up from the parking lot?
[24:50.37]We used to have a briefcase.
[24:51.27]This is genuine leather.
[24:53.37]Genuine leather made with only 4% polyester, so you know that it's high quality.
[24:57.84]You can fit pretty much anything in here.
[24:58.94]You can fit a disc in here.
[25:00.40]You can fit food in here if you really wanted to.
[25:04.16]I'll buy it.
[25:07.22]I'll buy it.
[25:09.76]I take your briefcase.
[25:11.16]So look, just to show you a little bit of a demonstration here.
[25:15.28]You have a briefcase, just like this one.
[25:16.92]You have a disc just like this.
[25:18.82]You can just easily put it in, close it up, and you've got yourself a business meeting, right?
[25:24.11]For the businessman on the go.
[25:25.63]See, for instance, you get in your car, like this.
[25:31.11]This is purely for demonstration purposes, you understand?
[25:35.97]Like, I'm in the car now, and I'm going to go take a trip to New York City, right?
[25:39.41]As a businessman, like you.
[25:42.88]You're a businessman, aren't you?
[25:44.08]You're... It's over.
[25:46.74]I win.
[25:47.76]I won!
[25:51.54]He's going to shoot me right in the fucking face.
[25:53.06]You can put a pizza in your suitcase for all I care.
[26:03.53]Yeah.
[26:06.18]I was just going to take off.
[26:14.81]What the fuck just happened?
[26:17.33]The timer.
[26:17.99]The timer.
[26:18.95]The timer is like 12 minutes.
[26:20.87]That's too short.
[26:21.83]A 12-minute game.
[26:22.94]No, we need to be 15, don't we?
[26:25.04]Don't worry, OXX.
[26:25.70]We're getting out of debt real soon.
[26:28.46]Don't worry, everybody.
[26:30.54]Thousands of dollars.
[26:31.98]Everybody, boys, don't worry.
[26:34.81]Buy a gun.
[26:35.57]Yeah, I need to buy a gun.
[26:37.39]Where do you buy guns?
[26:42.65]Where do you buy a weapon?
[26:46.45]I got a character this time.
[26:47.47]I'm going to be like dumb, big dumb idiot guy from the Looney Tunes.
[26:51.46]That's my character.
[26:52.12]I'm too broke to buy anything.
[26:53.40]That was my only gun.
[26:54.72]Which way do we buy a gun, boss?
[26:56.44]Tab.
[26:59.98]Tab.
[27:01.52]Okay.
[27:02.68]I think you're pressing tab.
[27:04.30]My son thinks so.
[27:06.36]You're not even my real dad.
[27:11.56]Don't say that.
[27:12.00]I love you.
[27:14.36]I hate this family.
[27:17.15]No.
[27:18.67]My son.
[27:19.79]I got him, man.
[27:23.71]Who wants to drive the car?
[27:25.39]I want to drive the car.
[27:29.68]I'll do it.
[27:30.24]I'm going to be so irritating this round.
[27:32.48]My real dad was Evel Knievel.
[27:34.68]Did you know that?
[27:36.50]It's the guy that jumped over the cars, right?
[27:40.32]Yeah, he jumped over all the buses.
[27:47.35]Oh, no, no, no.
[27:47.93]We can't fit in here.
[27:48.71]We can't fit in here.
[27:49.67]Get that car out of here.
[27:53.19]Yeah, we're going to park the car in your office.
[28:01.31]I'm just getting dumber by the second.
[28:03.84]Alright, we're going, we're going.
[28:05.98]Can we fit through there, you think?
[28:07.50]Oh, I don't think you can fit through there.
[28:09.70]A little tight.
[28:12.10]Back it up!
[28:16.35]Oh my god, this is so ridiculous.
[28:21.53]Alright, here we go.
[28:22.27]Whoa, whoa.
[28:23.35]Whoa, whoa.
[28:24.65]I gotta load this thing.
[28:25.59]How do I load it?
[28:28.34]You gotta go like this, right?
[28:30.86]And load it in there.
[28:31.60]Okay.
[28:33.51]Locked and loaded!
[28:34.23]I'm gonna be the point man this time.
[28:48.73]The crew is 50% big, stupid, cartoon dumbass.
[28:52.73]And the other half is cartoon... cartoon businessman.
[28:57.21]Alright, then I'm gonna change character.
[28:58.92]Hold on.
[28:59.22]Okay.
[28:59.60]I got fucking assassin.
[29:01.50]Like, master cool assassin.
[29:05.88]No, that's all equally as cliche.
[29:08.34]How about... How about, like, I'm a guy on fire the entire match?
[29:13.85]No, because I'll just be screaming.
[29:15.17]Hi there, Goldman.
[29:16.09]How you doing there, son?
[29:21.93]I'm sorry.
[29:22.31]I was just so nervous being in front of the boss.
[29:27.98]I'm going to kill the boss.
[29:30.80]I'm going to kill the boss.
[29:34.43]I'm going to kill the boss.
[29:42.13]I'm gonna try my best!
[29:43.69]Don't drive too fast!
[29:44.75]Oh, we're gonna kill some motherfuckers!
[29:46.85]Oh my god!
[29:48.29]Why, why, why, why, why?
[29:50.04]I'm okay, boss!
[29:51.42]I'm okay!
[29:53.06]Get in here!
[29:53.72]Alright, just start driving around.
[29:57.18]We're gonna find these assholes.
[29:58.46]They don't want to do business with us.
[29:59.80]They know we don't have shit.
[30:01.44]So we gotta... We gotta show them we do have shit.
[30:03.60]We have guns!
[30:04.22]Yeah.
[30:05.24]Yeah!
[30:05.94]We're going back to cartoon, idiot.
[30:09.08]That's easy for me to do.
[30:13.62]That's right.
[30:14.66]Dad, did you call him on the phone?
[30:17.58]Answer that.
[30:18.50]Hello, this is Goldman.
[30:22.92]Yeah, with a good cartoon peel-out.
[30:26.64]Vin Diesel.
[30:27.94]Yeah, Vin Diesel.
[30:29.22]The what?
[30:29.88]Wait, say it again.
[30:31.28]Yeah, I'll do that.
[30:32.90]That's good.
[30:33.48]Thank you.
[30:34.16]Hey, boy, easy.
[30:36.46]Oh, turn around.
[30:37.62]I think I saw that sign.
[30:38.62]Turn around.
[30:39.86]Turn around.
[30:40.56]Oh, the big button?
[30:42.62]The big button.
[30:44.17]It's a big buck right down here.
[30:46.61]Was it?
[30:47.23]Was it over that big buck?
[30:51.16]I haven't heard very much of this yet.
[30:54.20]Okay.
[30:54.32]Okay, that's weird.
[30:56.00]I'm not going to do it.
[30:56.94]In favor.
[30:58.42]Remember that movie where I couldn't see?
[31:02.85]All right, everybody free.
[31:04.97]Where's the drum going down?
[31:06.13]Oops.
[31:06.39]It's not here.
[31:09.29]Wait, they went inside.
[31:10.41]They lied to us.
[31:11.47]Where are they at?
[31:15.50]So I know where they are.
[31:16.80]Yeah, there was one time when I was in a trap in one of my movies.
[31:21.18]And then I took him over there and then we went and I shot him.
[31:26.88]That happened in one of my movies.
[31:29.58]Remember that one?
[31:45.17]Hey, be the best you can.
[31:48.29]And put your pedal to the metal.
[31:52.63]What did you just say?
[31:53.43]What did you just say?
[31:55.95]I'm losing my mind here.
[31:58.21]Where are you?
[31:59.39]We're at the big block.
[32:00.21]Where are you?
[32:01.03]I just like fucked up everything.
[32:04.44]They're just like, what the fuck is he saying?
[32:10.87]Don't play in traffic.
[32:12.11]All right.
[32:14.55]I said they're coming.
[32:17.51]We're just going to hang out for a little bit.
[32:19.83]You didn't press the button before you went.
[32:22.87]Careful in the street, son.
[32:23.97]Any second, these cars are going to start moving.
[32:27.71]Oh, there's one.
[32:31.44]Annie, it's a red light.
[32:34.20]You just wait.
[32:36.24]Chaotic.
[32:36.84]Oh, here they come.
[32:41.73]Oh, no.
[32:47.56]Oh, no.
[32:51.84]Oh, this is... Do we even have an objective?
[32:59.06]We lost the Goldman.
[33:00.48]That's too bad.
[33:01.12]It's not like there's, like, 700 million Goldmans.
[33:02.89]All right, they...
[33:09.13]I think we lost one over there.
[33:12.54]Let me go check on Mike.
[33:13.92]Alright, wait, where's the phone?
[33:14.84]I'm about to start fucking screaming at somebody.
[33:17.14]Like, let me see that phone.
[33:20.01]You wanna see that phone?
[33:46.94]That was a full team wipe.
[33:49.99]I just wanted the fucking phone.
[33:52.09]I wanted to talk to somebody.
[33:59.87]I must confess, it looks like we have to watch that.
[34:03.67]I would never kidnap such a lovely lady.
[34:06.72]Jesus Christ.
[34:07.32]I mean, like, yeah.
[34:10.34]As I was saying, yeah, it's got burgers, they're nice.
[34:14.21]You can get a manicure once you're done.
[34:15.87]I mean, not for me.
[34:16.83]Maybe for you.
[34:19.15]I don't know.
[34:20.68]Crazy, right?
[34:22.30]You know, I don't see the place you're talking about.
[34:28.70]No, no, no.
[34:29.26]We're not going to get over that.
[34:30.94]Who's bug is that?
[34:34.72]Where the hell was this?
[34:36.32]Where was this whole cool thing going on?
[34:38.68]I want to do an altercation.
[34:39.98]You guys like that game?
[34:42.69]Fucking Goldman's all sucked.
[34:45.63]What are they doing?
[35:00.92]Goldman's always doing the same thing.
[35:02.68]We walk around, don't find anybody and we all die.
[35:05.28]And we just screw about how we're from the Goldman's.
[35:09.87]We're the human equivalent of fucking seagulls.
[35:13.93]We just walk around and squawk and then die.
[35:16.03]You're right.
[35:17.63]We go to the burger joint every time.
[35:27.62]We're stuck in a loop.
[35:29.86]The Goldman's are stuck in a character loop.
[35:32.96]Our story arc needs to be completed.
[35:35.10]I couldn't hear him.
[35:36.40]I'll go get the briefcase and pick up the van.
[35:41.24]Let's go to the burger joint!
[35:42.54]We're the Goldmans!
[35:43.52]That's been our arc every time.
[35:45.10]Why is Dave on a date?
[35:50.68]We're even further in depth.
[35:53.82]That's so funny.
[35:56.37]Alright, got it.
[36:07.67]I'm joining a different team this time.
[36:10.72]I'm- I'm ditching the Goldmans.
[36:12.20]Alright, let's go.
[36:14.24]Where we going?
[36:14.76]We only have two minutes.
[36:19.35]Oh wait, that was- those are our- he has two phones in his hands.
[36:24.37]Wanna pick it up?
[36:27.07]No, I'm calling.
[36:28.09]Put your hands up.
[36:29.07]Wait, what?
[36:29.99]I think yours was just ringing on the other hand.
[36:31.57]No, stay with the Goldmans.
[36:32.63]Alright, the Goldmans are gonna have their day.
[36:36.07]Okay.
[36:38.80]Just you wait.
[36:46.95]You died because you broke character?
[36:48.89]No, I was trying to get into character and that's when I died.
[36:52.50]I was gonna get on the phone and talk.
[36:54.58]What the fuck are they doing?
[36:56.02]How are they still alive?
[37:04.95]Oh, they're not.
[37:06.33]No, yes they are.
[37:12.04]I love how he's doing the dual phone welding.
[37:17.21]He's just trying to call anybody.
[37:25.39]Whoa!
[37:31.05]Let's switch back to players.
[37:33.49]See what's going on here.
[37:36.66]There we go, that's better.
[37:37.26]Didn't we hit the big butt the whole time?
[37:39.84]Probably the burger place is the only place they know Really is the only place Although when we extend the rounds over dives in the first 10 seconds is gonna be gone forever I
[38:05.77]Yeah, I don't think they have their phone anymore.
[38:13.41]I think they're actually looking for us.
[38:16.94]Yeah, they're looking for us.
[38:17.84]He doesn't know that we all died.
[38:18.98]Look, they're there.
[38:19.58]They're gonna see.
[38:20.18]We're right there.
[38:20.86]Just turn around and you'll see all of us.
[38:22.42]They don't know.
[38:32.18]They don't even know.
[38:34.82]They're all right there.
[38:41.12]Somebody just needs to look at the screen.
[38:43.42]Oh, that's too bad.
[38:51.36]All right, I'm ready.
[38:58.46]We warmed up a little bit.
[39:09.18]Here we go.
[39:14.82]I'm grabbing that phone.
[39:17.39]I really want to congratulate the Goldman team on that last round.
[39:20.57]You guys did great.
[39:22.49]You guys did great?
[39:23.21]What happened there?
[39:23.91]Good luck.
[39:27.63]They got what they deserved.
[39:30.69]Through the briefcase.
[39:31.87]Because money doesn't even matter.
[39:35.69]It doesn't matter.
[39:40.51]All right, let's not let that happen this time.
[39:43.49]Yeah, I agree.
[39:45.31]Let's just, what do we have?
[39:47.23]Why do we never have anything?
[39:49.97]I'm the manager.
[39:50.99]I got the boss.
[39:52.41]Managers don't have bosses.
[39:56.95]There are the old bosses.
[39:59.61]No, I'm the company owner.
[40:01.03]I'm the CEO.
[40:01.51]You're just the manager of this branch.
[40:03.55]Fine, whatever.
[40:04.73]Let's go.
[40:06.14]You're a monster.
[40:07.20]Wait, let's buy a gun.
[40:08.54]I just lost a dollar selling a share.
[40:10.06]Come on.
[40:11.36]There we go.
[40:12.62]Buy me a gun.
[40:14.26]All right.
[40:14.52]Who do we want to go up to first?
[40:16.45]Everyone's getting an M16.
[40:18.83]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[40:19.37]You just bought so many of them.
[40:20.63]He's buying his own gun.
[40:22.21]I bought my own gun.
[40:23.09]Thank you.
[40:24.31]He's rich.
[40:25.25]Fine.
[40:25.81]Next one.
[40:27.57]All right.
[40:27.89]Anybody want that?
[40:29.79]I have an MP5.
[40:30.75]Well, I'll do a build.
[40:32.15]It's fine.
[40:32.80]All right.
[40:33.38]Well, you know what?
[40:34.16]Fine.
[40:36.07]I need ammo, though.
[40:37.49]Whatever, boss.
[40:38.57]I'm calling Monsada.
[40:39.55]Do you want me to buy you some ammo?
[40:42.18]They don't have a phone.
[40:43.50]Actually, he can buy you some ammo.
[40:44.56]You're the man.
[40:44.94]What about them?
[40:45.74]Do they have a phone?
[40:46.52]I can't, actually.
[40:47.66]They just put a hold on my card.
[40:50.42]Sorry.
[40:51.46]Sorry.
[40:52.02]Can we not?
[40:52.86]Somebody have a phone.
[40:55.59]Sorry, boss.
[40:56.75]His account is frozen.
[40:58.77]My account's frozen.
[40:59.79]We're all out of money.
[41:01.00]The Bowmen are out of money.
[41:02.10]We're broke.
[41:02.66]No, they don't have a phone.
[41:04.14]They don't hold the phone.
[41:04.76]I want to save this money, okay?
[41:06.60]I got 39 Gs.
[41:09.00]The guy that's dual welding the guns.
[41:10.90]He gets the front seat.
[41:12.26]Alright, alright, alright.
[41:17.61]You gonna have to bluff?
[41:19.17]Somebody buy us a car.
[41:25.03]God, the controls are so bad.
[41:28.13]Three.
[41:31.03]Get off the phone.
[41:32.93]You gotta talk to the Goldmans, goddammit.
[41:35.01]Here we go.
[41:37.52]Hold on, I got this.
[41:49.50]Wait, was that... Oh, wait, wait, they're calling me!
[41:51.68]I thought that was the dial tone!
[41:53.02]Hello.
[41:54.36]Hello.
[41:57.79]What's happening?
[41:58.51]How are you?
[41:59.07]Good to talk to you.
[42:01.85]You guys want to do a little bit of business, eh?
[42:04.58]Yeah, actually, it's good you called because I've really been dodging my phone calls, it seems.
[42:13.06]Oh, no, we weren't dodging your phone.
[42:14.34]Look, we were on a call with OXS, you know, and they're a little bit desperate.
[42:19.25]You know, they don't got much money.
[42:21.21]What are you saying?
[42:22.23]What are you saying?
[42:23.76]Shut up.
[42:24.18]Do they have the green disc?
[42:26.88]Come on.
[42:27.74]One at a time, please, okay?
[42:29.32]First of all, you know who you're talking to, right?
[42:31.38]You're talking to the fucking Goldman's.
[42:33.42]Nobody has a disc.
[42:34.82]It's a limo.
[42:36.08]Come on, you're in the car.
[42:38.24]You pay attention to me when you're on the phone with me, you understand?
[42:40.61]I'm not driving.
[42:44.53]Do not disrespect me like that again, or it's going to be your fucking head cracked on the side of a road.
[42:51.59]Okay, yep, I hear you loud and clear, Mr. Goldman.
[42:53.82]So first of all, if you didn't know, the Goldmans have a survival rate of at least three minutes.
[43:04.04]You can't put that up against anybody else.
[43:09.87]So first of all, where are we meeting?
[43:11.65]Are we meeting somewhere in particular?
[43:14.37]Meet us!
[43:14.69]Meet us at the arcade!
[43:21.29]Oh, we just drove by it.
[43:22.93]Meet us at the bank.
[43:25.97]Meet us at the mall.
[43:28.81]Meet us at the friendly pet supply.
[43:31.87]Hey, what about Big Buck's Gun Shop?
[43:36.59]That sounds pretty good.
[43:37.83]Hey, will you fucking slow down?
[43:39.43]We're trying to meet somebody.
[43:40.91]One six of a pizza, you know.
[43:49.34]Guys, do you want pizza?
[43:50.58]Would you rather have pizza?
[43:55.43]I'm gonna have to call you back.
[43:57.47]I think that's you.
[43:58.31]Is that you?
[44:01.03]Can you see me?
[44:01.83]I'm waving my hand right now.
[44:03.01]Can you see me?
[44:04.55]What happened?
[44:07.13]What happened?
[44:09.10]What happened?
[44:09.50]What happened?
[44:13.46]What happened?
[44:23.00]Did we go to the end of the earth?
[44:32.57]Oh, that was just getting funny too.
[44:34.03]I was like, we were going to talk, uh, drive next, next to each other.
[44:38.83]What happened there?
[44:41.46]That was the objective somehow.
[44:44.08]Hey, Shane, I'm sorry.
[44:44.92]No, we were chasing the limo at the time.
[44:46.86]Oh, are you?
[44:47.86]Someone killed it, I guess.
[44:48.76]I don't know what happened.
[44:49.42]That was the objective.
[44:50.28]We won.
[44:50.46]I think someone might have put their money in the bank.
[44:52.33]I only have 600 bucks.
[44:53.05]I have 600 fucking dollars.
[44:54.37]What the hell is going on?
[44:55.51]What the hell?
[45:06.76]We were this close, boss.
[45:07.92]We were this close.
[45:09.22]Okay, guys, let's get back into character.
[45:12.46]Three, two, one, action.
[45:13.92]Same deal, okay?
[45:15.10]Keep it up.
[45:16.38]Everything's going great.
[45:17.10]You guys are doing a great job.
[45:18.22]Okay, here we go.
[45:20.76]We have to sell that disc.
[45:23.15]Okay, good work.
[45:23.73]That's me.
[45:40.78]As if acting.
[45:47.00]Try not to run me over.
[45:49.19]I'm very fragile.
[45:51.85]Everyone just hop in.
[45:54.55]Hop in.
[45:55.39]You can drive around.
[45:59.05]They're on the phone right now.
[46:00.11]You want me to pull over so you can hear them?
[46:05.28]No, Terry.
[46:06.06]I'm alright.
[46:08.35]I'm used to being on the phone in a beehive.
[46:10.23]It's okay.
[46:17.09]Easy, Goldman, one.
[46:18.93]That was cool as fuck.
[46:21.04]Step on it, baby.
[46:21.78]We gotta get out of here.
[46:25.86]Is anybody picking up your call?
[46:29.04]Hey.
[46:31.30]Hey.
[46:32.28]Sorry, but I think we got disconnected last time.
[46:34.55]Are you in a dead zone?
[46:35.55]Are you in a dead zone right now?
[46:37.72]Oh, yeah.
[46:38.02]I think we went through a tunnel.
[46:38.96]That was it.
[46:39.54]Yeah.
[46:40.52]We went through a tunnel, too, at the same time.
[46:42.64]It was great.
[46:43.56]Oh, we made the same tunnel.
[46:45.49]Oh.
[46:45.99]It must have been the same tunnel.
[46:47.01]You know, that's quick.
[46:47.95]But anyways, so we don't have to kill you so you can live another day.
[46:51.49]You're going to bring the stuff to the one-sixth of a pizza slice?
[46:55.77]Is that what we're doing?
[46:57.63]Yeah, that sounds good.
[46:58.53]We'll see you at one-sixth of a pizza slice in about three minutes.
[47:01.92]Three minutes.
[47:02.50]Okay.
[47:03.18]It might take us a little bit longer.
[47:05.10]For certification purposes,
[47:06.66]We've got a briefcase with all kinds of good stuff.
[47:08.80]It's a loot box.
[47:09.82]It's an Overwatch loot box.
[47:10.92]There might be a rare skin in here.
[47:12.76]So you just need to be ready for that.
[47:16.97]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[47:18.43]We're coming.
[47:19.09]I'm sorry.
[47:19.43]Come on.
[47:32.84]Okay, see you at 1-6 Pizza Slice in probably two hours.
[47:36.08]Okay.
[47:37.08]You fucking idiot!
[47:41.76]You understand what the fuck is going on here?
[47:45.28]I'm on the phone with goddamn XAX!
[47:47.12]Embarrassing me again.
[47:50.58]I'm not getting out of this car.
[48:04.79]Damn it, I gotta make a fucking phone call.
[48:09.54]Hey, uh, you might be able to hear a little bunch of shit in the background.
[48:12.40]Can you come to Bridge 4?
[48:15.08]It's got... I think, yeah.
[48:16.86]Hey.
[48:20.17]This is you, right?
[48:20.95]Yeah, we're... Yeah, so thanks for coming.
[48:23.77]You can hang up now.
[48:36.63]These are new shoes.
[48:37.49]I just fell over a little bit.
[48:39.95]We don't have any guns or briefcases.
[48:41.45]What don't you understand about that?
[48:43.09]We have nothing.
[48:46.83]We have a briefcase.
[48:47.55]It's sitting right in his hand.
[48:48.49]Just show him what's in there.
[48:49.39]Show him the goods.
[48:50.07]That's a McCree skin.
[48:51.11]I don't even know what's going on.
[48:53.34]I have no fucking idea what's happening.
[49:05.29]Why are we all here?
[49:06.13]Is this VR chat?
[49:07.59]That's what it feels like.
[49:09.39]How do I throw this on the ground?
[49:13.45]There we go.
[49:14.61]Is he squished?
[49:34.66]Come on, you can make it.
[49:35.30]It's just like, it's limbo.
[49:36.70]Horizontally, though.
[49:39.24]Somebody shut that fucking car up!
[49:42.13]Alright, uh, can we get out of the car?
[50:00.03]I feel like we're having this meeting in a blender.
[50:01.93]Oh, my God.
[50:02.29]Here comes another one.
[50:03.29]Watch it.
[50:04.09]Watch out.
[50:04.55]Oh, my God.
[50:05.04]I'm about to end this game.
[50:06.06]Just park it right here.
[50:40.10]Get out of here!
[50:42.58]How do I reload the gun?
[50:45.94]I just threw the gun on the ground.
[50:47.20]Fuck.
[50:49.88]Give me the gun.
[50:52.38]Give me the gun.
[50:53.64]I threw the empty magazine on the ground.
[50:55.70]Here we go.
[50:56.34]Okay, hold on.
[50:56.94]Just stay there for a second.
[51:00.04]He was a boy.
[51:01.96]He was young.
[51:03.91]Put it in.
[51:04.49]No, fucking give me the gun.
[51:07.31]No, I got... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[51:09.68]I gotta... I gotta take the magazine out of this one.
[51:13.58]I gotta... Put this down.
[51:15.86]I need to take the magazine out of this one.
[51:17.38]Swap it around.
[51:17.92]Okay, put this one down.
[51:19.56]It's...
[51:33.38]Get the magazine out.
[51:35.02]Oh my fucking lord.
[51:36.90]Throw it away.
[51:40.96]Got it.
[51:41.34]Okay, where's the other magazine?
[51:42.54]Give it to me.
[51:46.85]I'm still figuring this out.
[51:48.59]Okay, there we go.
[51:50.79]Alright, where is he?
[51:51.95]Where are all these bastards?
[51:59.52]Which Mr. Goldman are you looking for?
[52:01.24]There's four of us.
[52:15.59]Why would they have the cars this loud and you can't turn them down?
[52:20.32]The whole game is one audio slider for everything.
[52:27.52]What?
[52:28.06]Was that... Like, I got an idea.
[52:30.42]Let's make a video game where you have to be able to listen to people, but have the fucking car sounds as loud as possible.
[52:36.92]No, no, don't pick me up.
[52:38.62]Don't pick me up.
[52:39.42]Where are you?
[52:41.54]He just chewed you all up.
[52:46.33]We're all gonna... Still alive.
[52:49.15]Still alive.
[52:49.65]Still alive.
[52:50.09]Shut the body.
[52:55.27]Asher doesn't even know how to load those guns.
[52:58.22]That's so slowly moving Waffle.
[53:00.38]That's the saddest part.
[53:01.56]He has no idea what he's doing.
[53:03.14]Oh my god, look at him.
[53:05.37]He's whining away.
[53:06.59]He's bleeding.
[53:07.15]Those guns were never loaded.
[53:14.17]He never forgets how hard.
[53:16.43]He didn't know how to load the gun.
[53:18.47]It's fucking hard, man.
[53:19.81]Pick up the gun.

[55:29.89]Goodbye.
[55:32.03]Watch that street.
[55:33.07]Watch crossing the street.
[55:36.10]I think... I think it might be Jant... Kraken?
[55:39.68]What are you doing?
[55:42.18]Can you take one of these cards?
[55:44.66]It's like why is he walking around like he's holding his pants up?
[55:48.41]Forget your belt?

[55:54.22]Before it turns green.
[55:55.58]When you take these cars.
[55:58.68]Kraken's about to play Frogger in about five seconds.
[56:05.74]No, he's just going to take one.
[56:12.89]All right, he figured it out.
[56:16.63]There you go.
[56:22.55]If he died that would have been perfect.
[56:26.73]Dude, oh my god.
[56:29.97]I'm really sorry.
[56:31.76]I didn't know how to do it.
[56:32.46]He's blasting my neck.
[56:34.14]We weren't even supposed to bring this stuff.
[56:35.76]There he goes again.
[56:39.78]What the fuck?
[56:40.38]He's dead.
[56:41.44]Wait, what did he die?
[56:42.33]He's dead.
[56:43.11]Oh my god, he fucking died.
[56:46.07]This is... the fucking pit.
[56:49.01]It's the fucking worst.
[56:50.63]Yeah, he fell.
[56:51.99]He dove off.
[56:53.11]He was too busy holding his face.
[56:54.75]Oh my fuck.
[56:55.47]I'll see you later.
[56:57.55]Who's even left alive?
[56:58.25]Look at all these dead bodies, dude.
[57:03.13]He's literally the only person that's left.
[57:04.85]Oh no!
[57:05.87]It's just fucking Shane.
[57:08.23]It's always just Shane.
[57:09.62]He's the only person alive like every round.
[57:11.86]Alright, now what do we got here?
[57:14.96]I don't know how to play this game.
[57:16.00]Oh my god.
[57:16.50]He's the slammer.
[57:18.00]Yeah.
[57:18.36]Nobody knows how to play this game.
[57:21.06]Let's switch up the stream for the team's next round.
[57:25.38]Wouldn't it be... Wouldn't the objective be over?
[57:28.34]This is the last guy that's remaining on Earth, right?
[57:30.16]Why would it... Shouldn't it be over?
[57:31.66]He's the last person standing.
[57:32.69]He won PUBG, right?
[57:35.21]Yeah.
[57:35.49]It's meant to be like... Yeah.
[57:37.99]I mean, you can restart the round, Tomato, right?
[57:40.51]I don't know what the command is specifically, but I feel like Shane's doing it right now.
[57:45.04]Or he's trying to figure out how to unload his gun.
[57:50.04]You're wrong.
[57:50.62]I mean, his weapons carry over.
[57:52.46]He's probably, like, really excited that he has a gun, finally.
[57:56.24]Yeah.
[57:56.98]They're all automatic.
[57:59.26]You can change, though.
[58:00.28]Yeah.
[58:00.40]Well, that worked.
[58:14.87]You got 47 seconds.
[58:15.89]Oh, he's gonna run over your dead corpse.
[58:28.44]What?
[58:28.90]Oh, okay.
[58:29.20]He does have a loot conveyor belt here, though.
[58:42.49]Oh no, Shane.
[58:43.63]At least grab that stack of money.
[58:45.01]He's committing suicide.
[58:45.85]Shane, the car!
[58:47.45]The car!
[58:48.01]Is he even going to get there in 15 seconds?

[60:20.01]Go ahead, take a seat.
[60:21.67]You don't have any furniture yet?
[60:23.37]This is a true startup.
[60:25.45]Sit down.
[60:26.91]Okay, all right.
[60:27.57]Hey, we're a startup cryptocurrency.
[60:29.71]Don't you know what you're signing up for?
[60:30.81]No beanbags or anything.
[60:32.11]We're just sitting on the floor.
[60:34.31]Nice, man.
[60:35.37]No outlets, too.
[60:36.27]You guys are really such a startup here.
[60:38.41]No outlets?
[60:39.78]Yeah, we bring our own battery charger.
[60:42.30]Yeah, that's green.
[60:43.20]Real green, man.
[60:43.88]Real green.
[60:44.40]I like that.
[60:45.04]How does TNA work in this company?
[60:47.04]And how do I file a proper TPA report?
[60:49.02]I don't know what TNA really is.
[60:50.46]So, I mean, I guess we don't have that.
[60:53.92]What about a TPA report?
[60:55.33]How do I properly file a TPA 500 report?
[60:57.61]Yeah, we don't do those either.
[61:00.95]That doesn't sound very green, man.
[61:02.29]We like to have fun here.
[61:05.93]Is this an adult daycare?
[61:07.25]What is this?
[61:07.83]What are we doing here?
[61:08.69]This is kind of like Google, but without the oogle.
[61:13.62]I love it.
[61:15.18]It's G. Oh, G. It's all G, baby.
[61:20.60]Let me take you to where we store the money.
[61:22.22]So are we proof of stake, proof of capacity, proof of work?
[61:25.79]How are we?
[61:26.59]What is that?
[61:26.95]I don't know what that means here.
[61:30.27]Are we a second layer blockchain solution with proof of stake?
[61:34.60]They don't know shit.
[61:35.30]Yeah.
[61:35.44]And you have disposable plastic plates here, right?

[62:10.38]Phone!
[62:32.73]All right, Goldman.
[62:33.71]I was doing a voicemail thing.
[62:35.17]Works for a tech company.
[62:36.51]If you don't pick up the phone and you leave a voicemail, it makes them see.
[62:40.41]We sound like we're really busy right now.
[62:42.41]All right, boss.
[62:43.51]So now I'm going to call in.
[62:44.59]Wait.
[62:45.81]Boss, I hear a phone outside.
[62:46.96]Someone's outside.
[62:47.56]Let me load up my gun.
[62:59.92]Make sure I have a weapon here.
[63:01.95]You got the tiny little pistols in this company because we like to keep it light.
[63:06.64]Well, no, we shoot celery bullets, so.
[63:10.42]Yeah, we like saving money.
[63:12.14]Why is there a big white barb on your head?
[63:14.54]What does that mean?
[63:15.34]Yeah, what does that mean?
[63:16.30]I mean, he's a boss.
[63:17.76]I don't want the phone.
[63:18.52]I don't need it.

[66:14.71]Yes, you do see.
[66:15.75]Wink.

[66:21.15]Yeah, just like that show.
[66:22.89]That show sucks.

[66:25.18]That's all I had.

[66:26.56]Must have paid for having to wear that funny hat for $12,000.
[66:28.28]Put it back in the case.

[67:00.15]Thank you.
[67:00.47]Nothing, guys.
[67:01.21]Come on in.
[67:02.69]Well, I give 110%, you know what I mean?
[67:04.09]Where are we going?
[67:05.03]Do we actually have a deal that we're making here?
[67:07.39]Somebody want to get on that phone and figure out what we're doing?
[67:11.56]Let's, uh... Okay, do you want to call or should I call?
[67:16.42]Hello?
[67:18.32]Hello?
[67:19.56]Second gear, just make sure you guys know I'm very transparent with my driving.
[67:24.75]Okay, there we go.
[67:25.27]Now it's ringing.
[67:25.75]Now it's ringing.
[67:26.45]We're good.
[67:26.73]We're good.
[67:27.39]Hold on.
[67:27.67]Hold on.
[67:29.28]I missed it.
[67:30.82]We just crashed transparency.
[67:32.50]What does this look like?
[67:33.24]Hello?
[67:33.36]I mean... No, you're good.
[67:34.30]You're good.
[67:34.70]I don't think they know anything to the phone.
[67:48.17]There you go.
[67:48.87]U-turn.
[67:49.15]That kind of sounds like my app I'm working on.
[67:51.27]It's going to be like an Uber and Lyft competitor.
[67:53.37]We have the money.
[67:54.07]We have money.
[67:55.73]We want the money.
[67:56.73]This is the perfect time to enter that market.
[67:58.91]I think so, too.
[67:59.37]Where are you at?
[68:00.55]We want to meet up.
[68:01.27]A third angle.
[68:04.21]Okay.
[68:04.57]Oh, good trip.
[68:05.21]Nice trip.
[68:05.99]Going to the museum.
[68:06.65]All right.
[68:08.42]I don't know how to break.
[68:09.18]Full transparency.
[68:09.56]Fucking U-turn app.
[68:10.18]Where's the meetup?
[68:11.46]Oh, the museum.
[68:11.90]I love the museum.
[68:15.15]Do we know where that is?
[68:34.87]No.
[68:36.55]No.
[68:37.99]Okay, great.
[68:38.67]Let's drive around till we see you.
[68:40.13]Okay, just wait a minute.
[68:40.89]So how the U-turn app is going to work is you end up getting in the app and you connect to somebody that's currently driving a car.
[68:48.47]And then what you're supposed to do is you give them directions for where they're trying to go.
[68:53.37]So I'm going to give you guys a little bit of a tutorial.
[68:54.93]So go ahead and open up your U-turn app, please, and give me directions because I connected to you through the app.
[69:00.64]All right, let me take out my phone.
[69:05.43]Okay.
[69:07.89]Okay, so, uh, hello, U-turn, I'm looking for a place to go.
[69:14.18]Friendly, make sure it's friendly.
[69:15.36]I'll look the column up again and ask him.
[69:17.28]To the museum, please.
[69:18.64]To the museum, please, U-turn.
[69:30.64]Pick up U-turn, please, pick it up.
[69:34.40]Hey, uh, where's the museum at?
[69:36.32]Our GPS is down right now.
[69:38.68]Thank you, U-turn.
[69:41.22]Hello?
[69:41.90]This... Oh, I know where the lobby is.
[69:46.90]Holy shit, stop fucking firing!
[69:49.49]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I got really excited.
[69:51.17]Hi, you guys there?
[69:54.77]Hello?
[69:56.87]Oh god!
[69:57.35]Is that the museum?
[69:58.29]No, that's the lumber mill.
[70:01.09]U-turn.
[70:02.67]Excuse me, U-turn, where do I go?
[70:07.59]From here?
[70:07.97]Current location, U-turn.
[70:11.19]U-turn, we're on the wrong lane.
[70:13.23]Wait, what?
[70:14.93]I said U-turn, which lane am I in?
[70:17.35]Yeah, we have money.
[70:22.31]You want the money from us.
[70:25.21]Just tell him to meet us at the Mega Trax.
[70:28.30]We're at the museum!
[70:29.24]Our driver's dying!
[70:30.16]Hey!
[70:30.98]Hey!
[70:34.00]We just got hurt!
[70:35.90]Hold on!
[70:37.68]Oh, okay.
[70:38.12]Hey, hey, hey.
[70:38.82]Get him.
[70:39.75]Get him.
[70:40.07]Let's go to the mall again.
[70:42.51]Hey, we'll meet you at the mall.
[70:44.59]Yeah, I mean, we'll meet you at the mall.
[70:46.17]U-turn!
[70:46.51]Yeah, we're at the mall.
[70:48.31]I'm really nervous.
[70:49.41]I don't know about it.
[70:50.29]I still don't know if I understand how U-turn works.
[70:52.21]Do we just stay a place and it takes us there?
[70:54.45]Well, you just say a place, and then eventually, after a while of saying it a bunch of times, everyone collectively will figure it out, especially the person, the representative on the phone.
[71:01.26]That's on the U-Turn app.
[71:05.30]You're getting directions from a guy on the phone.
[71:06.70]Yeah, yeah, so these guys, like... Did you guys use the U-Turn app, man?
[71:09.78]Use my referral code.
[71:10.34]http.uturn.org slash jj184 That's my... We get $20.

[71:24.55]That's okay.
[71:24.85]Why am I bleeding?
[71:25.51]I'm gonna die.
[71:28.63]I see what's going on here.
[71:55.04]Even though I'm wearing a different color suit.
[71:58.18]Don't even think about it.
[71:59.54]Don't even think about it.
[72:01.30]And we start thinking of an entire world together like we've known each other for years.
[72:06.19]And years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years.
[72:11.67]And you're finally happy because you don't need anything other than me and you in this moment because we could be anywhere, baby, and we'd be happy.
[72:18.85]Excuse me.
[72:21.23]In all the world's problems.
[72:22.53]Do you have a Band-Aid?

[72:57.29]We both get $20.
[72:57.91]It's a deal.
[73:12.45]I pick up the gun.
[73:13.85]He's getting away.
[73:14.77]I'm fine.
[73:15.51]What did he have?
[73:16.23]This is fucking chaos.
[73:18.93]We want money.
[73:19.89]Take that out.
[73:20.71]He's got money.
[73:21.29]He's got money.
[73:21.99]All right, give him the balance ball.
[73:23.81]Hey, Dad.
[73:24.27]Take it.
[73:24.69]Hey, Dad.
[73:40.96]This is like what happens if you put a bunch of birds in a cage together.
[73:44.07]You know how many birds... You know what?
[73:46.51]Okay, look.
[73:47.21]Hold on.
[73:48.89]Let's talk.
[73:49.41]You know when you go to the pet store?
[73:52.49]Let's go in the sky for this one.
[73:53.60]Okay.
[73:54.84]You know when you go to the pet store, and inside of the pet store you've got the lizard cage, you've got the fishes, you keep going down to the dog food, and then there's the bird cage with 15 birds inside the cage, and it's just like...
[74:10.64]They're all, like, running into each other and, like, biting each other.
[74:12.76]This is just the pet cage birdhouse.
[74:16.29]The pet store bird cage.
[74:22.67]See?
[74:22.93]Lookit.
[74:23.25]Some bird just threw a car out the window.
[74:24.89]Alright, let's spectate these four birds.
[74:36.15]Anybody tell me the key that I pressed to fire my weapon?
[74:39.27]I don't know, it's fucking hilarious, but that's what this is.
[74:41.83]Is your weapon loaded?
[74:44.16]He's just putting a bunch of cockatoos, 20 of them in the same box.
[74:47.70]I got my gun on the floor!
[74:56.56]How are they all still alive?
[75:03.52]He missed all of them.
[75:06.48]He missed them all.
[75:12.48]Going right to the glass.
[75:17.73]Take the briefcase.
[75:23.87]They're down.
[75:24.61]They're down.
[75:25.51]You gotta jump.
[75:26.77]Next time I should do grandpa.
[75:28.35]I don't know.
[75:29.07]Let me grab a gun.
[75:34.79]That glass looks like it's still cut.
[75:36.39]Is that person eating the money?
[75:41.38]No.
[75:41.56]Oh, did you get away with that?
[75:45.84]He's not dead.
[75:49.08]Don't even bother looking back, kid.
[76:04.16]Don't even bother!
[76:05.21]I'm bleeding!
[76:08.91]I'm gonna die!
[76:10.19]He's gonna get hit by him.
[76:11.59]He's gonna get hit by this car.
[76:13.69]Wait, no!
[76:14.93]It went right through him.
[76:15.93]He's a ghost.
[76:16.49]He's still alive.
[76:17.33]He's a fucking cryptid.
[76:19.11]I cheated death again!
[76:21.53]What?
[76:22.94]The car didn't kill him, but that did.
[76:25.54]He's electric on the wall.
[76:27.44]He looks like it's a car.
[76:28.70]Does he have 4500 ping right now?
[76:37.80]He's got like 30,000 ping.
[76:51.61]Somehow, I still have money.
[76:58.95]You need 100 player mode?
[77:00.85]Oh lord.
[77:01.57]I'm not sure how well that would work.
[77:08.66]All right, we'll do old.
[77:10.09]We'll do old person.
[77:11.13]That sounds good.
[77:13.09]Hey, guys, we're going to restart the server and boost up the round limit.
[77:16.65]Yeah, that's a good call.
[77:20.47]Good.
[77:20.59]No, that's pretty bad.
[77:23.07]I honestly don't know.
[77:26.43]Here, Asher, if you're on our team, I'll teach you.
[77:28.69]It's basically you just got to use each of your hands and unload your gun after you've already used all the ammo.
[77:34.86]Restarting.
[77:36.46]Here we go.
[77:37.06]Restat.
[77:41.12]Explain the okay.
[77:41.78]So let me explain what the hell's even going on.
[77:43.98]There are three teams Eat, you know, and I'm speaking from total ignorance So this is how I am determining how this game is three teams each team has something the other team wants so you have a briefcase you have money and the other one has a Phone or something.
[78:00.33]Everyone has an object that they have to trade There's really no I don't know if there's a real objective really they might be I
[78:09.84]I don't know.
[78:10.75]I can't join, no.
[78:14.09]No, wait, hold on.
[78:15.71]I think he's actually restarting the whole thing.
[78:18.79]Be right back.
[78:22.43]I need to exit, I believe.
[78:24.45]Yes, I do.
[78:29.28]How does that look?
[78:30.84]Yeah, maybe.
[78:33.52]Two teams have an object, one team has nothing, and it has to steal the object.
[78:40.49]It's essentially you have to play tricks on each other and that game exists.
[78:46.79]But when you have the birdcage at the local mall, things get a little tricky.
[78:56.86]We are waiting for a restart of the server, I believe.
[79:02.43]So I'm just going to chill for a sec.
[79:11.34]Hold on, let me just check.
[79:13.54]Make sure things are going smoothly.
[79:15.10]Uh-huh.
[79:23.78]Looks like it.
[79:30.70]Oh.
[79:33.24]Do a meow round.
[79:35.43]I'm not sure that'll work.
[79:37.17]That's a long time.
[79:42.25]I can't join the server now.
[79:44.03]Hmm.
[79:47.06]There we go.
[79:49.02]Hey, how we doing?
[79:53.26]We good?
[79:53.98]We back?
[79:57.26]I believe we are.
[80:03.47]Yeah.
[80:05.25]Ooh, that frame rate.
[80:06.63]What happened?
[80:13.86]Ooh, that frame rate.
[80:18.21]That's not good.
[80:21.47]Whoa, the whole game crashed.
[80:25.11]Interesting.
[80:26.45]Well, let me open it back up.
[80:28.73]Sorry about that.
[80:33.84]It's going to be like that for half the round.
[80:35.14]Yeah, it was like that when we first joined, too.
[80:39.92]Let me just try to open it again.
[80:44.13]So the weird thing about this game is I remember seeing this game on Steam.
[80:48.33]That it was coming soon, like three years ago.
[80:52.67]And now you can't even search for it on Steam.
[80:55.83]You need to get a special link.
[80:57.70]You need to get like a Steam link.
[81:00.76]To even buy the game on early access.
[81:03.54]It's really strange.
[81:04.32]There we go.
[81:10.46]What?
[81:15.07]It's been around for years.
[81:15.95]Yeah.
[81:18.69]There we go.
[81:22.09]That should do it.
[81:27.67]Oh, this is the right server, right?
[81:29.33]Oh Lord.
[81:34.29]Hello?
[81:37.41]Hello.
[81:38.21]Hi.
[81:42.85]Hey!
[81:44.13]How are things?
[81:44.95]How are you?
[81:45.67]You doing good?
[81:49.75]Oh, I'm... You talking to me?
[81:52.96]Talking to... Yeah.
[81:55.84]Yeah.
[81:56.88]Yeah.
[81:57.74]What?
[81:58.24]You know you can do this?
[82:04.10]Okay.
[82:04.30]Oh!
[82:04.64]Somersault.
[82:05.53]You ready?
[82:06.73]One, two, three.
[82:09.62]Yeah, show me.
[82:10.20]How do you do that?
[82:10.70]That looks so much, that looks so cool.
[82:12.22]Nice.
[82:13.58]Check this out.
[82:14.09]I learned this in Assassin's Creed.
[82:16.53]I don't know how to do that.
[82:17.29]Pretty close, pretty close.
[82:20.45]I can't get up.
[82:22.01]You guys are doing it.
[82:23.05]You're doing it.
[82:23.41]I'm going to try one more time.
[82:24.57]Ready?
[82:24.81]Assassin's Creed.
[82:25.61]Assassin's Creed.
[82:29.31]Did I backflip?
[82:30.13]That's halfway.
[82:31.53]You start looking up and you start, you flick down as you jump while running.
[82:42.81]That didn't work.
[82:43.67]Did our money get refunded?
[82:50.14]That looks so cool.
[82:55.70]Check me out, baby.
[82:56.20]Check me out, baby.
[82:56.60]Yeah, man.
[82:56.90]All right, everyone load up.
[82:59.63]AKs.
[83:00.53]Ammo.
[83:02.37]AKs.
[83:05.41]Arm to the teeth and ready to bash.
[83:07.25]Let's go.
[83:08.41]I got a lot of money.
[83:09.63]I'll take the phone.
[83:11.14]We got a lot of money.
[83:12.04]Let me get it in the other hand here.
[83:17.76]Oh, I'm getting a call.
[83:20.26]I'm getting a call.
[83:20.82]I'm getting a call.
[83:22.36]Hello?
[83:26.08]Goldman?
[83:27.64]What the fuck is going on in here?
[83:32.48]My favorite businessman.
[83:34.66]What can we do for you?
[83:37.14]I think you got the door closed.
[83:38.10]You okay, Goldman?
[83:41.18]Yeah, you guys mind if I play some music?
[83:42.90]Do you want to say hi?
[83:45.08]Yeah, I do.
[83:46.24]No music.
[83:49.12]Oh, you can have my disc, baby.
[83:51.16]Alright, what do you want to meet?
[83:52.64]No, you can play music.
[83:53.30]I just got a little angry there.
[83:55.06]Sorry about that.
[83:55.84]What are you going to put on for music?
[84:04.65]The print... Hey, boys, have you ever heard of the print shop?
[84:07.47]The print shop.
[84:09.39]The print shop.
[84:11.83]No brand name?
[84:14.01]Brandless print shop?
[84:18.07]Pharmacy?
[84:18.87]We know what a pharmacy is?
[84:21.36]Oh, pharmacy.
[84:22.32]That is... Nassau Pharmacy.
[84:24.96]What did you just say?
[84:25.86]I know where the lumber mill is.
[84:26.66]Did you just say pharmacy?
[84:33.68]All these non-people.
[84:35.16]Who are we meeting?
[84:40.13]Who are we meeting?
[84:42.51]We're meeting, uh, Goldman.
[84:44.55]Wait, we just passed, uh, those guys.
[84:45.85]All right.
[84:47.66]Wait, where are we going again?
[84:53.00]Baby's Lawnmower Sale Preserve.
[84:56.20]Baby's Lawnmower Sale?
[84:58.02]What?
[85:00.72]Is that what he just said?
[85:01.83]Baby Lawnmower Sale.
[85:06.03]Is it near the mall?
[85:09.71]There's a lot of loud things here.
[85:13.61]Okay, okay, we're at the park right now.
[85:15.47]Is that helpful?
[85:17.03]No, I'm talking about the cars.
[85:17.89]The cars have nobody in them.
[85:19.07]There's no people.
[85:19.81]There's just non-people in the park.
[85:21.11]All right, let's head towards Goldman.
[85:23.55]Keeping it local.
[85:25.27]All right, we're in the mall.
[85:27.93]We're going to keep it local.
[85:35.19]Oh!
[85:36.01]We are perfectly fine.
[85:37.03]We're going to...
[85:41.03]I think we're, I think we're at your base.
[85:53.78]By the way, I love the Scooby-Doo Fred Flintstone peel-out sound.
[85:56.92]That's what happens when Fred Flintstone's legs are spinning.
[86:00.32]You're at Baby Lawnmower Sales.
[86:02.06]Alright, guys, head left from the Goldman Base.
[86:04.47]We're going to go to Baby Lawnmower Sales and Service.
[86:07.77]Alright, Baby Lawnmower Sales and Service.
[86:10.75]Baby lawnmower sales and service.
[86:13.11]Are you sure that wasn't a Google Android robot that put that together for you to do?
[86:17.13]Baby lawnmower.
[86:18.01]I'm looking.
[86:19.33]We see a parking garage.
[86:22.50]Google, please generate a sentence.
[86:25.20]Oh, baby's lawnmower.
[86:26.52]There it is.
[86:26.98]Right there.
[86:27.76]We see it.
[86:28.32]Baby's lawnmower.
[86:29.38]Come on in.
[86:29.98]Come on in.
[86:30.52]Okay.
[86:33.03]All right, we'll park in the back.
[86:35.83]Yeah, park in the back.
[86:36.55]You don't want to see anybody.
[86:38.63]Hey.
[86:40.29]Are you alone?
[86:40.57]Is this a window service?
[86:43.61]Come in the door.
[86:44.69]Come in the door real quick.
[86:46.45]All together at once so I can do something.
[86:49.71]Okay.
[86:50.21]I mean, this is a competition.
[86:51.71]Yeah, that makes complete sense.
[86:53.43]Of course, let's all go together at the same time.
[86:55.35]All right.
[86:57.57]On the count of three.
[86:59.19]All right.
[86:59.83]One, two, three.
[87:03.21]Hello?
[87:04.57]Well, well, well.
[87:06.66]If it isn't
[87:08.10]Oh, wax ass.
[87:10.94]Oh, sorry.
[87:12.73]They startled me a little bit.
[87:14.41]That's all I got.
[87:15.51]Yeah, it's just me, by the way.
[87:17.47]You guys are kind of running the show, but I do got this briefcase.
[87:22.07]What's in the case, man?
[87:23.43]Here's the deal.
[87:24.33]We can offer you.
[87:26.63]We'll take your briefcase, and you can leave.
[87:29.23]Okay, where's the disc, though?
[87:32.09]Well, that's because it's a fight thing.
[87:34.02]We don't actually have the disc.
[87:37.77]This is a ruse.
[87:39.25]And you felt for it.
[87:40.29]Well, it's not necessarily a ruse.
[87:42.95]This one right here?
[87:45.53]I think I just forgot to pick it up when we were at our friendship zone.
[87:51.72]Are you a car or are you a human?
[87:55.66]Is it a motorcycle?
[87:56.28]That's a code word.
[87:57.04]Alright, what about this one?
[87:59.10]You guys like this one?
[88:00.16]You like him around?
[88:00.84]Yeah, I like him.
[88:02.26]Wait, what are you saying?
[88:03.26]Who are you pointing at?
[88:04.78]Well, I got some guys.
[88:06.94]Right on the phone, I can deal with all your... I think the server crashed.
[88:16.42]He picked up the phone and it killed the server.
[88:20.57]Hello?
[88:21.39]Oh, shit, he pressed the kill server button on the phone.
[88:24.95]Boo!
[88:25.77]Yeah, he did.
[88:26.89]He called in the fucking Calvary.
[88:32.97]What a clicker.
[88:33.53]Hey, what the fuck?
[88:35.38]Hey, let's try that again, all right?
[88:38.62]Hold on.
[88:38.88]Restart the server.
[88:40.66]Shane.
[88:43.50]Speedrun.
[88:44.66]We have 27 seconds to do it.
[88:46.00]Hold on.
[88:47.43]We have to restart.
[88:51.33]To be continued.
[88:52.75]Hey, Asher, you like this game?
[88:58.29]Get me in here.
[88:59.24]I'm very confused.
[89:01.87]Come on, I gotta do something crazy in eight seconds.
[89:03.63]I have eight seconds to do something fucking crazy quick.
[89:14.95]Wait, why is it still going?
[89:21.34]Check this one out.
[89:25.88]Man, did you try to straighten it out?
[89:27.48]Straightening it out.
[89:29.66]Got it.
[89:30.52]That way.
[89:30.92]Are we going?
[89:34.06]Are we moving?
[89:34.60]Oh, alright.
[89:38.31]We got everybody in here?
[89:39.13]Uh, this is gonna be a little bit of a challenge to get out of here.
[89:57.99]No one got the phone.
[89:58.63]Nobody needs the phone.
[90:01.57]It's so close, not so far.
[90:02.41]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[90:09.20]It's done.
[90:09.44]You know, the phone is the catalyst here.
[90:19.27]Every time a phone gets involved, the server goes down.
[90:23.27]I think this is a hard crash, too.
[90:28.61]Uh-oh.
[90:31.97]Well, there we go.
[90:34.84]Just a moment here.
[90:35.52]Actually, I'm going to take a piss.
[90:37.42]I'll be right back.
[90:38.70]Maybe we'll get it restarted and redone.
[90:41.26]Be right back.
[90:42.14]Go take a peek.
[90:42.56]See you in a minute.
[93:12.90]Okay, let's try this again.
[93:19.98]Sorry that there's a little bit of a technical issues.
[93:24.13]It's all good though.
[93:27.15]It's all good.
[93:28.27]There we go.
[93:33.55]Let's get back into it.
[93:36.28]I think it restarted.
[93:47.50]That was a good pee.
[93:48.26]I got a little bit of Arnold Palmer.
[93:52.39]Half lemonade, half iced tea.
[93:53.87]It's good shit.
[93:58.17]Server does not seem to be up yet.
[94:04.69]If it is, it don't work.
[94:08.09]Get ready to blue screen.
[94:09.33]You know, it wouldn't surprise me.
[94:11.64]There we go.
[94:13.58]I think that worked.
[94:14.60]Hello.
[94:17.73]Oh, hey, I made... I'm going to go on Monsota.
[94:22.41]No, I'll do Goldman.
[94:25.15]Always Goldman, right?
[94:26.71]If it's available.
[94:29.55]Yeah.
[94:31.43]So, okay.
[94:37.71]Let's just start calling random numbers.
[94:39.69]Who cares?
[94:40.33]Just annoy them.
[94:54.37]The game is a virus.
[94:57.48]Nobody wants to pick up, huh?
[95:01.98]Ah, pick up.
[95:04.74]Hello?
[95:07.18]Yeah, this is just Goldman making sure that we have a connection here in the server.
[95:11.05]Yeah, I can hear you loud and clear, sir.
[95:15.33]Cool.
[95:15.57]How's it going?
[95:16.27]Good.
[95:16.67]Just want to make sure we have our data packages working.
[95:19.61]Yeah.
[95:23.53]Yeah, it's working.
[95:24.23]Sounds good.
[95:24.83]Crystal clear.
[95:25.89]I can hear you.
[95:26.93]Good, because, yeah.
[95:27.63]How about you and me go get a... Oh, hold on.
[95:30.24]The compression sounds really good.
[95:32.10]How about we go get a burger?
[95:35.92]No, you want to meet the burger place?
[95:38.68]The Goldman's love that.
[95:39.74]The Goldman's love going to get burgers.
[95:41.62]It's our favorite thing in the world.
[95:42.94]All right, I would love to meet you there.
[95:46.02]Yeah, fuck all these other guys.
[95:47.24]Establish a bit more of a connection.
[95:48.74]Get to know each other.
[95:53.36]Shit, it's gone.
[95:56.74]Is it though?
[95:57.38]Maybe it's restarting.
[96:01.20]Hello?
[96:03.36]Hello?
[96:05.38]Are you fucking with me?
[96:07.60]I literally wished you a happy birthday.
[96:11.75]When I first joined in here, I said happy birthday.
[96:16.15]What the fuck, dude?
[96:18.45]Who the fuck did you think I was?
[96:20.09]Whose birthday is it?
[96:21.27]Happy birthday.
[96:23.58]Whose birthday is it?
[96:24.36]You can't leave me on a cliffhanger.
[96:25.64]I'm the only Goldman.
[96:27.32]Oh, fine.
[96:27.84]Fuck it.
[96:29.78]I'll show you how a real Goldman does it, guys.
[96:31.60]I'm the only Goldman.
[96:32.37]That is by design.
[96:34.25]Give me the briefcase.
[96:37.55]Open this shit up.
[96:41.73]I'm loading this thing full of money.
[96:50.21]I will be the only sole proprietor of the Goldman fortune.
[96:57.65]Okay, fine.
[96:58.95]Where's the phone?
[97:01.14]I'll show you how it's fucking done.
[97:08.72]Yes, who is this?
[97:10.32]Fucking asshole.
[97:17.03]You hang up on me like that again.
[97:24.15]I've never heard that song, but you... Listen, I know that you lost your acting gig at Charlie Brown.
[97:36.69]Yeah, I know.
[97:37.37]I understand.
[97:38.17]It's tough.
[97:40.57]I'm taking the money.
[97:51.42]I'm taking the money to the goddamn... I'm calling somebody else.
[98:07.70]Hey, this is Goldman.
[98:09.16]Don't call Monsanto.
[98:11.70]It's a fucking Charlie Brown adult, and you can't even talk to it.
[98:15.69]So anyways, I got cash.
[98:17.93]What do you mean I can't talk to you?
[98:20.91]Huh?
[98:23.27]I'm going to make this very clear.
[98:24.71]I'm going to speak very slowly.
[98:26.43]Extremely slowly so you can understand.
[98:28.11]Okay?
[98:30.23]I'm from different parts of town.
[98:32.45]God damn it.
[98:34.39]That's fine.
[98:35.70]Listen.
[98:36.80]Do you understand me?
[98:37.44]I'm going to speak very slowly.
[98:40.30]Yes, I understand you.
[98:41.18]Money.
[98:41.50]I have money.
[98:45.12]I have money.
[98:48.58]I have money.
[98:50.06]Yes, me.
[98:50.72]Not you.
[98:51.06]I have it.
[98:51.46]Yeah, we've got money.
[98:53.18]These two's money's right there.
[98:55.76]Just listen to me.
[98:56.50]I've got a briefcase full of money.
[98:58.82]And I want the goddamn disc.
[98:59.90]No, we've got a briefcase full of money.
[99:02.34]No, this whole town is full of fucking idiots.
[99:09.80]I know you've got some money.
[99:13.86]Look, I'm on my laptop right now, and I'm trying to figure out... I'm trying to trade some stocks at the same time.
[99:18.80]Where are you going to be?
[99:22.08]Where's it going to be?
[99:23.02]That's our house place.
[99:24.98]OXS's.
[99:26.40]You're at OXS's headquarters.
[99:31.55]Yes, sir.
[99:32.55]I'm a busy man.
[99:33.57]I can't handle this right now.
[99:36.39]Tell me where you are.
[99:37.39]I said, yes, sir.
[99:45.11]All right, I'll be there- I'll be- you know what?
[99:47.33]I'll be there in about two minutes.
[99:48.85]You just stay- Oh, shit!
[99:52.03]Oh!
[99:53.67]Oh!
[99:54.97]Oh, fuck!
[99:56.70]How did this happen?
[99:57.90]Oh, my leg!
[99:59.80]What the fuck?
[100:03.00]What, I was just using a laptop, counting my money, talking on the phone, and obstructing my vision.
[100:08.64]How did I get in a fucking car accident?
[100:11.50]Oh, God damn it!
[100:17.98]Fuck!
[100:26.14]I can't use the... Alright, the cell phone.
[100:27.75]That's fine.
[100:28.21]Let's go.
[100:29.65]The only goddamn Goldman I need.
[100:35.37]Fine.
[100:35.73]Where are those headquarters?
[100:37.05]Let's look in the cell phone.
[100:42.40]God damn it.
[100:44.56]I need to pay attention to the fucking road.
[100:52.33]Whoa!
[100:59.19]Hey.
[101:00.09]Hey.
[101:01.77]Where are you guys?
[101:02.85]What's happening?
[101:04.68]Holy shit, we're doing a fucking ghost crew.
[101:08.30]Sorry.
[101:09.62]What are you saying?
[101:11.12]I'm trying to find out.
[101:12.01]I got a briefcase full of money, and I got two people that can't even talk to me.
[101:19.44]Accident on Main Street.
[101:20.72]Are you all right?
[101:23.64]I can't drive my car.
[101:30.29]It's been a real hard time.
[101:31.39]We can trade you whatever you need.
[101:33.37]Just come help us.
[101:34.91]Okay, can you scream real loud so I can know where you are?
[101:36.89]Because it's very loud out here.
[101:39.09]We're screaming really loud all the time.
[101:41.33]Okay, I'll come find you.
[101:43.87]Main Street, you said?
[101:44.79]What's the nearest landmark?
[101:45.99]I don't know.
[101:48.47]They're looking at me in the window.
[101:50.67]I'm coming.
[101:51.11]Please come quick.
[101:51.95]I'm coming.
[101:52.71]Give me the landmark.
[101:55.39]I don't know what the landmark is.
[101:56.61]There's a yellow building across the street.
[101:57.89]It says Main Street.
[102:01.33]Maze?
[102:02.71]You're stuck in a maze?
[102:06.31]I'll be there in 30 seconds!
[102:07.27]I have no idea where the fuck they are.
[102:15.04]I'm driving real fast.
[102:21.56]Let's try the other guy.
[102:28.60]Yellow building.
[102:31.28]gas station.
[102:32.56]Goldman.
[102:34.00]Oh, that's where I came from.
[102:35.02]That's my house.
[102:35.86]I have no idea who the fuck they are.
[102:43.00]Wait a minute.
[102:48.35]And Goldman is here to save the day.
[102:50.49]Get in the car.
[103:01.47]The one true Goldman is here.
[103:02.93]I'm being pushed.
[103:03.65]Hold on.
[103:04.03]I fell out.
[103:11.32]Get on in.
[103:11.94]All right.
[103:14.28]Get in.
[103:14.88]Get in.
[103:17.68]I'm driving.
[103:18.26]What is that?
[103:19.90]Are you guys on the same team?
[103:22.32]Hold on a minute.
[103:31.58]I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
[103:36.94]Hey, I think you just left me and my friend.
[103:38.50]I just came.
[103:39.62]I'm Goldman, by the way.
[103:40.44]The one Goldman.
[103:41.26]The only Goldman that's in this town.
[103:44.15]You just almost hit me.
[103:45.49]You almost ran right into me.
[103:46.39]I want to make sure that... Oh, you fucking dickhead!
[103:49.41]Let's go!
[103:49.61]Get in the car!
[103:50.05]You don't even need the damn phone anymore.
[104:03.31]No, no, no.
[104:04.15]That's the money.
[104:04.81]Keep that.
[104:12.51]There.
[104:12.93]Figured it out.
[104:17.78]Come with me.
[104:21.62]Watch this.
[104:22.08]Get in the car.
[104:26.83]This is just like in a movie when you and I are from completely different Romeo and Juliet backgrounds and we end up saving the day together.
[104:32.47]You know what I'm saying?
[104:33.37]Our love cannot be denied.
[104:34.37]Get in.
[104:34.63]Get in that car.
[104:35.01]Check this out.
[104:56.68]Hey, buddy!
[104:58.16]Thanks for the Tony Award.
[105:00.85]You killed my parents, man.
[105:07.71]That's so fucking hot.
[105:09.87]Look at that.
[105:11.03]He's covered in glass and eviscerated.
[105:13.41]Make sure you take those guns.
[105:16.43]Yeah.
[105:19.79]Bullets are still in here.
[105:20.71]Just checking.
[105:24.47]Shit.
[105:29.07]Hey, you... You want to be in charge of the briefcase?
[105:33.65]Yeah, I can take that.
[105:35.51]Well, that's a fucking lot of money.
[105:36.87]Yeah, that's a lot of money.
[105:37.89]That's Goldman money.
[105:38.76]That's gold-backed money.
[105:40.04]Why do you think the last name... Don't you dare!
[105:44.88]I don't know.
[105:45.16]I did that, like, a long time ago.
[105:46.22]I knew that I had that much money.
[105:53.62]Darling, hell for what you did, boy.
[105:57.97]No.
[105:58.33]I just got to put it to gear.
[105:59.43]No, that's impossible.
[106:00.11]Don't worry about that.
[106:00.74]Yeah, no, you should have just pulled me at that much money.
[106:02.36]It would have just given us a little bit.
[106:04.60]Yeah, come on.
[106:07.74]I thought we were doing Romeo and Juliet.
[106:09.30]I thought we were Romeo and Juliet.
[106:11.80]I was lied to.
[106:13.65]We're sending you to a special part of here.
[106:18.51]What do you mean?
[106:20.85]I never did anything bad.
[106:21.91]I didn't want to do this, kid.
[106:24.73]What the fuck are these two doing?
[106:26.07]Where are you putting me?
[106:26.91]I have to do this.
[106:27.67]Where are you putting me?
[106:29.63]Put me down.
[106:30.17]Why am I floating?
[106:32.71]What are they doing?
[106:36.84]I'll just leave you in this room for a little bit.
[106:39.46]What the fuck are they?
[106:42.40]Oh, it's just him.
[106:43.20]He's got the money.
[106:43.96]Don't leave me in this room.
[106:45.50]Don't leave me in this room.
[106:48.04]Don't walk away from me.
[106:49.74]You made me do this.
[106:57.60]The story has a twist.
[107:00.43]Oh, here comes Comcast.
[107:02.87]Have we been streaming for two hours?
[107:05.06]Time to end it because my internet fucking turns off.
[107:19.19]What the hell is he playing?
[107:26.28]I don't know where the bass is.
[107:32.52]I can't get a new internet provider.
[107:33.70]There's only one.
[107:34.40]I have to move.
[107:36.24]I have to move across the country.
[107:39.37]Wait, are you playing this in the room that I am in?
[107:46.01]Oh my god!
[107:47.06]Oh, he just did like the Scrooge McDuck pogo stick.
[107:51.48]Where is this music coming from?
[108:09.69]Who's playing this music?
[108:12.89]I can't get away from it.
[108:17.76]And just when you think it's done... No!
[108:23.32]I hope it was... Oh, it's an spectator.
[108:28.04]I'll never do anything bad again.
[108:31.27]If you just get me out of here, I'll never do anything bad again.
[108:43.06]Get me out of here!
[108:45.11]Get me out of here!
[108:47.49]Get me out of here!
[108:51.81]What was that?
[108:55.19]Am I being too loud?
[108:56.71]Sorry.
[108:57.37]What's up?
[108:58.27]Is this hell?
[108:59.39]It might be.
[109:00.47]What?
[109:13.52]Right in the chest.
[109:24.71]I wish my internet... Why, internet?
[109:27.26]Why do you have to do this?
[109:35.80]Can we turn off like the $14 Target toy?
[109:53.07]Okay, I'm done.
[109:54.09]All right.
[109:54.77]Nope.
[109:55.33]No more bits.
[109:56.29]No more bits.
[109:58.45]I'm done.
[110:22.01]Hey, you gonna pick that up?
[110:25.71]Is the internet good?
[110:26.53]Are we alright now?
[110:27.59]We might be.
[110:27.91]We were doing our silent movie RP, and Kraken thought I was a random.
[110:34.84]He's got 47 seconds to figure this out.
[110:36.54]What's he gonna do?
[110:41.62]I'm sorry, I didn't... The objective is to listen to the music.
[110:48.86]Nobody jinx it.
[110:50.38]Yeah, it's still having trouble.
[110:52.16]All right, 30 seconds.
[110:52.78]Same shit happened last time.
[110:57.02]Is this even my base?
[110:57.86]Am I delivering to the wrong base?
[110:58.84]Well, here's the thing.
[110:59.97]At least it was watchable for two hours.
[111:02.73]It's annoying.
[111:11.61]Yeah, so I actually talked to somebody at Twitch about it.
[111:13.95]Oh, my God.
[111:14.29]Pick it up.
[111:15.64]And they said that I'm probably being routed somewhere.
[111:21.29]That's just fucking everything up.
[111:23.65]Because on my end, it's fine.
[111:25.75]On Twitch's end, it's fine.
[111:27.41]But somehow, whatever carrier I'm going through is just all fucked up.
[111:34.86]And there's no way I can fix it.
[111:35.90]They said there's literally no solution.
[111:38.62]So I have to move.
[111:39.84]I have to literally move my house.
[111:42.02]I got to put like Archie from Pete and Pete has to come and lift up my house and bring it somewhere.
[111:49.75]Are we just switching now or what?
[111:51.73]You know what I could do is I could probably try to get my IP changed, which would maybe route me somewhere else.
[111:59.66]Because of these two boys.
[112:02.14]Where am I?
[112:02.90]These two boys.
[112:06.84]The throttling is not bad, but I'm not being throttled.
[112:10.08]Because my internet is fine.
[112:13.12]According to the way it looks on a speed test, it's fine.
[112:17.33]It's just whenever I use Twitch, it just sometimes turns the fuck off now.
[112:23.71]So I'm sorry that it's going to be a little slow and glitchy every now and then, but I can't help it.
[112:30.82]I wish there was something I could do.
[112:31.66]I have to move and mention the cards.
[112:32.52]Don't do that, sir.
[112:33.99]Now, time to get back in the funny guy mode.
[112:36.25]Funny, time for funny mode.
[112:37.79]Hey, how you guys doing?
[112:42.14]How's it going there?
[112:43.26]Who wants cheese?
[112:46.74]Oh, yes.
[112:49.46]Now what was that for?
[112:52.56]Now what is this for?
[112:56.93]What are you doing?
[112:57.73]Have you guys lost your damn minds?
[113:01.75]That man just tried to murder me.
[113:04.06]What the heck?
[113:04.80]Has he lost his mind?
[113:07.55]I thought he was on our side.
[113:08.55]Does he know who he's messing with?
[113:10.91]I put the disc in the tray.
[113:14.37]We've lost a Goldman now.
[113:15.73]Now we have three Goldmans.
[113:17.09]Let's make a deal.
[113:22.96]Alright, I need a gun.
[113:28.34]Give me a... Give me an M16.
[113:31.19]I got the money.
[113:35.61]How much money do I got for... Uh, yeah, let's get the, uh, the blue beamer.
[113:39.45]Why not?
[113:39.95]I got the blue beamer.
[113:40.79]Where's... I got the key for it now.
[113:42.05]Where is it?
[113:42.41]Alright, I got the phone.
[113:45.47]Let's make a deal, see?
[113:46.25]Is that the blue beamer?
[113:48.67]I just bought a new car.
[113:56.22]Is it... I bought this car, right?
[113:57.64]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[113:59.60]Yeah, here.
[114:01.52]Here, take the phone.
[114:04.16]Where's the phone at?
[114:04.90]Let me see it.
[114:08.06]Right here.
[114:08.44]Go get the phone.
[114:10.54]Behind you.
[114:11.00]Make some calls.
[114:12.06]Behind you, sir.
[114:12.58]Right here.
[114:13.66]Oh, there it is.
[114:14.32]Okay, let me take it.
[114:16.08]Yeah, let's get it, sir.
[114:23.48]Hello?
[114:25.16]Well, hello there.
[114:26.10]Good morning.
[114:27.06]Morning.
[114:27.42]Who's this?
[114:29.60]Hello?
[114:30.06]Can you hear me across the phone there?
[114:32.80]I can hear you.
[114:33.34]What do you want?
[114:35.81]I really can't hear you, and I'm going to need you to start speaking real soon.
[114:38.97]Otherwise, I'm going to call the other guy for what they have.
[114:41.66]Is that okay with you?
[114:43.32]Yeah.
[114:43.50]Where are you from?
[114:46.37]And my boys are giving it their all.
[114:48.16]I can't really hear what you're saying, so... Thompson, I'm asking where you're from.
[114:52.40]I'm picking up an accent.
[114:53.38]I feel like we're in the same area.
[114:54.80]Oh, well, well, well.
[114:55.88]Yes, yes, yes, you are.
[114:57.86]My accent is actually from the great state of New Pennsylvania, Georgia, actually.
[115:02.74]Oh, well, that's funny.
[115:03.51]It's a made-up state.
[115:04.75]I didn't think... Now I don't trust you at all.
[115:07.85]I would have taken Texas.
[115:09.33]I would have taken... And this, by the way, this ain't even my real accent either.
[115:13.25]You understand?
[115:15.35]What you talking about now, boy?
[115:17.21]I'm talking about making fake accents.
[115:20.32]All because you believe it's made up and it's not?
[115:22.04]Well, that's very rude of you, sir.
[115:23.26]I don't appreciate your tone or the way you're treating me or my people, so I'm going to get on down off this phone.
[115:27.66]Hey!
[115:28.46]Why don't you come back?
[115:33.49]Let's meet up here.
[115:35.61]We'll meet up here.
[115:37.83]Hello, who is this?
[115:39.86]Uh, hey, uh, come on down to the burger joint.
[115:41.84]We got a deal to make.
[115:42.98]Uh, you can't miss it.
[115:46.72]It's in one of the big stands.
[115:51.38]If you just back, back away from... Dude, don't put me on hold, please.
[115:56.88]Don't put me on hold, please.
[115:58.14]I'm on fucking hold.
[116:03.48]I hate when this happens.
[116:05.62]It's really, really irritating when you get put on hold.
[116:10.44]Representative.
[116:11.80]I got fucking ho- what?
[116:13.02]Call back.
[116:23.31]How do I still on hold?
[116:24.87]I call- Representative, hello.
[116:27.57]Zero.
[116:28.15]How do I press zero?
[116:33.70]Zero.
[116:36.98]Hello, yes.
[116:37.63]Hi, yeah, I'm calling.
[116:39.83]I'm having trouble with my car.
[116:41.57]I'm having trouble with my computer car.
[116:43.01]I don't know if you can help me out here.
[116:46.77]Yeah, okay.
[116:50.06]Put me on hold again.
[116:50.88]Understand the internet problems I'm having with my internet car.
[117:01.35]Yeah, hi.
[117:02.05]I just got... No, no, no.
[117:09.11]I'm looking... I wanted to do the tech support.
[117:10.91]I'm looking for a representative to help me with my internet card.
[117:13.45]I'm having problems.
[117:15.90]Yes.
[117:18.36]I was just there.
[117:19.50]You don't have to connect me.
[117:20.50]I was just... He's sitting next to you in the boiler room that you're both in.
[117:24.36]God damn it.
[117:30.52]Didn't you ever see that movie with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck?
[117:32.92]They're in the same room.
[117:34.78]It's just a ruse.
[117:35.80]They put you on hold.
[117:37.74]Hello.
[117:41.72]Hi.
[117:42.00]This is Frank.
[117:44.12]Hi, Frank.
[117:47.53]All right, I'll put you on hold.
[117:49.85]Don't you do it.
[117:50.61]All right, we'll be safe here.
[117:56.21]They keep putting me on hold, guys.
[117:57.43]I'm sorry.
[117:57.97]I'm trying to get a hold of them.
[117:59.39]I've been routed four times.
[118:00.53]And they fucking hung up on me.

[131:44.18]You want less of them around?
[131:46.92]Oh, it's hard to determine who's talking.

[132:14.55]How did that happen?
[132:17.59]I don't want to hear it from you.
[132:18.73]It's contact lenses.
[132:19.67]It's tag contact lenses.
[132:20.96]Oh, he's doing one of those Halloween costume contest things.
[132:24.14]Yeah.
[132:24.62]Yeah.
[132:25.18]He's never took them off.
[132:25.98]Have we reversed enough a jump?
[132:28.54]Okay.
[132:29.04]All right.
[132:29.62]Okay.
[132:31.34]Didn't really clear the jump, huh?

[132:32.92]Don't jump out.
[132:33.78]Don't jump out.
[132:35.56]Don't jump out.
[132:36.22]Man, you know who's right.
[132:40.50]I think he's dead.
[132:42.19]I think he's fucking dead.
[132:44.29]I want to... I can't leave.
[132:46.91]Why are you holding a hostage?
[132:48.65]We're on the same side.
[132:49.91]I'm getting out.
[133:21.60]I looked away for a second.
[133:22.74]What happened?
[133:24.04]He was trying to back us over the edge.
[133:25.70]So I got out of the car and I happened to be on the side that was over the edge like that.
[133:30.20]And I fell.
[133:30.66]Slow.
[133:31.24]I'm going slow.
[133:40.18]One step at a time, guys.
[133:41.28]Let's get back to the van for now.
[133:44.44]I think we should go back to the poop-and-cum RP.
[133:46.66]I really like that.
[133:47.69]Oh, god.
[133:50.21]Next scene!

[134:24.40]It's only one wheel.
[134:25.02]Thank you pop the back
[134:40.54]Looks like he's about to spray paint the back of his car.
[134:43.04]Oh, he's fucked.
[134:48.72]The phone is ringing, by the way.
[134:53.43]He's just holding it in reverse.
[134:59.73]I am so far zoomed out right now because that is so loud.
[135:03.38]Oh, no.
[135:05.32]Oh, no.
[135:06.76]They're pushing me out.
[135:12.78]What is happening?
[135:16.70]Is he squished in between?
[135:27.99]That's just one of those weird pony ride things that sits out in front of the grocery store.
[135:32.51]You put the quarter in, you sit on it, and it just shakes around.
[135:39.12]Sometimes it's an elephant, sometimes it's a tiger.
[135:41.34]Ah, well, there they are.
[136:12.95]Watch me
[136:39.83]I'm so glad that Comcast didn't crash for that one.
[136:45.25]Hey, I'm gonna do the poop, guys.
[136:46.69]I've been practicing.
[136:47.49]I think I can get the poop this time, okay?
[136:50.27]You gonna do the poop?
[136:51.01]Okay, I'm gonna do the poop.
[136:52.93]What's the over-under on half these guys falling off the edge?
[136:56.01]Who's gonna jump off the edge first?
[137:00.84]I need to see that clip.
[137:02.50]Oh, that's Kraken.
[137:10.45]Oh, come on!
[137:16.59]Take him out!
[137:17.67]No!
[137:18.49]No!
[137:20.31]He's dead.
[137:27.20]And they think we're all dead.
[137:28.38]We could jump out.
[137:29.42]I said time tracking.
[137:31.39]Okay.
[137:32.39]I was just close to coming, dude.
[137:33.97]I was just close to coming.
[137:35.99]Oh, me too.
[137:36.55]Now they're going to come on us.
[137:37.51]Fucking God.
[137:37.93]I'm joining this cuddle party here.
[137:39.31]Yeah, come on.
[137:40.70]Yeah, oh, man.
[137:41.98]Can I drop a scud missile on this right now?
[137:44.68]Whoa.
[137:44.98]Whoa.
[137:49.29]I'm not really into this kind of thing, but, uh, I'm unopposed.
[137:54.53]Is that guy running out of the car?
[137:56.71]Oh, there we go.
[137:57.57]I think they're the only guys left.
[138:00.74]Yeah, there's nobody else.
[138:01.70]Oh, I'm bleeding from places.
[138:18.56]That wasn't even the same guy, man.
[138:20.24]Awww.
[138:48.73]Oh, well.
[138:53.73]Is that it?
[138:55.01]Would you guys ever wonder if... Is anybody still alive?
[139:10.28]I can't live like this.
[139:11.50]I can't live like this.
[139:13.16]There he goes.
[139:13.76]He's going to go over.
[139:14.36]He's going to go over.
[139:15.82]He's going to get out of here.
[139:18.24]That would be funny if he couldn't do the jump.
[139:26.38]Alright, this time, I ain't gonna fucking... I ain't gonna fall off.
[139:40.06]When you get shot in the back of the head.
[139:42.86]He walked right into it.
[139:50.88]Alright, you guys feel a new game?
[139:54.54]Yeah.
[139:57.00]Yeah.
[139:58.74]Yeah, you can get what you need, B-Boys.
[140:01.54]B-Boys?
[140:02.00]I'm sorry, B-Guys.
[140:04.40]I didn't mean it.
[140:05.25]I didn't mean it, B-Guys.
[140:07.45]I'm sorry.
[140:08.09]I was having a good time.
[140:09.21]Alright, just hop in Discord and we'll figure it out.
[140:14.19]Okay.
[140:14.33]We got something lined up.
[140:15.83]Alright, check this out.
[140:23.50]So we're probably going to move on to play a different game.
[140:30.11]We're probably going to play that SCP game.
[140:33.41]And if my internet, oh, hopefully the internet stays on.
[140:36.21]We'll play that for like an hour or so probably.
[140:39.15]I've never played this before.
[140:40.33]It's SCP something.
[140:43.04]I have no fucking idea.
[140:46.38]But give me like a minute so I can figure it out.
[140:48.16]I'll be right back.
