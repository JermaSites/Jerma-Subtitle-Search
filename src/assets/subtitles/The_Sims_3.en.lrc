[05:12.22]I feel like a grandpa video.
[05:19.87]Yeah, I did.
[05:21.51]This is a grandpa video.
[05:24.37]Let me just... Hold on a minute.

[06:37.34]We're going to make a Sim.
[06:38.36]It's going to be me.
[06:39.34]It's going to be Jeremy.
[06:44.50]Should it be a household?
[06:46.52]But will I?
[06:47.58]My name is Peter.
[06:49.06]Okay, can somebody that's a Family Guy fan tell me?
[06:51.81]Has there ever been a time where Peter has gone, My name is Peter.

[06:56.69]I'm gonna do this.
[06:57.89]My name is Peter.
[06:58.73]Has it ever happened?
[07:00.15]I have been looking for it.
[07:04.94]Sing the song?
[07:05.74]No, because everyone just thought it was a Family Guy routine.
[07:07.86]And now I'm like self-conscious.
[07:15.26]I'm gonna be dreaming about that.
[07:24.08]I'm gonna have nightmares about that.
[07:25.44]Alright, let's do Jerma Elbertson.

[07:30.46]Don't worry Okay, I've definitely gained a lot of weight Make the saw house Let's see
[07:46.07]Well, I definitely... My stomach has gone out a lot.
[07:52.26]The Sims 3 actually has a pretty robust creator.
[07:53.98]I forgot.
[07:56.96]You are not a young adult.
[07:58.22]Yes, I am.
[07:58.62]What would you classify as not?
[08:01.70]What do you mean not?
[08:04.62]Am I not anymore?
[08:10.71]You're an elder.
[08:11.81]I'm just a regular adult?
[08:15.73]35.
[08:15.95]Oh, shit.
[08:20.19]I think you're right.
[08:20.79]Yeah, I think you're right.
[08:21.51]Alright, that looks good.
[08:26.27]Faces.
[08:26.59]Let's go to face.
[08:34.05]Can I, uh... Yeah, advanced.
[08:35.03]Let's do... Out of the eyes.
[08:37.33]Advanced.
[08:37.77]This doesn't even need to be... This doesn't need to be accurate.
[08:42.31]I don't... What do I care about?
[08:46.06]You forgot how old you were.
[08:47.16]No, I feel like a young adult still.
[08:49.82]No, I don't.
[08:50.24]I have a shitload of health problems.
[08:56.05]I remember how I felt when I was 30.
[08:57.57]I don't feel like that right now.
[08:59.05]You know what I'm saying?
[08:59.87]What was the big announcement?
[09:04.87]Well, interesting.
[09:07.56]Well, interesting.
[09:19.21]What if I just didn't even have an announcement?
[09:20.49]This is just a way to get as many people here as I could.
[09:25.25]There just- There is no- This is not even me, by the way.
[09:28.20]This is- This doesn't look anything like me.
[09:39.35]You ever have a dream of somebody that you know?
[09:43.91]And they look like this in your dream.
[09:46.27]And they don't look anything like that.
[09:50.15]I swear to God, I dream about this person all the time.
[09:52.53]And they're supposed to be my dad.
[09:55.15]This exact person.
[09:57.10]Shows up as my father, as a friend, as a colleague.
[10:02.28]I don't know why, it's just this face.
[10:03.90]Happens all the time.
[10:07.62]Have you dreamed of this man?
[10:08.78]Yes, all the time.
[10:23.09]grill master?
[10:23.75]It doesn't have to be me.
[10:31.50]You know what?
[10:32.86]This looks like when Disney finally makes the Pinocchio IRL remake.
[10:39.91]Don't you feel like this is like the IRL live action Pinocchio?
[10:48.60]They'll make him like a... Just a guy that lives in like a flat in Pennsylvania.
[10:58.44]Wait, they don't change the story in the live action remakes.
[11:00.94]What are we talking about?
[11:05.96]Why would they just remake it and have him be a guy that lives in like New York City or something?
[11:09.34]That's alright.
[11:16.51]Should I just mod the fuck out of this game too?
[11:20.28]So we're gonna play this a couple times.

[12:39.15]Okay.
[12:44.05]I love picking outfits and hats and stuff.

[13:01.52]Why am I a serpent?
[13:08.68]Lies come so naturally to your forked tongue.
[13:12.11]It's definitely this one, but it's not, though.

[15:10.70]Young Bugleberry?
[15:20.45]Akon Bugleberry?
[15:21.29]Alright, this would be Young Bugleberry.
[15:22.73]That's actually a good idea.
[15:27.67]What's his name?
[15:28.27]Barry?
[15:29.25]Bernard?
[15:29.61]What's his name?
[15:32.04]He told me it once.
[15:32.90]I don't remember it, though.
[15:46.50]Yeah, Barry, Bernard, Bugleberry.
[15:48.12]Something like that.
[15:48.84]I'm going to keep it as Elbertson, though.
[15:55.83]I actually like that.
[15:57.70]I am so excited.
[15:58.88]I'm like trying so hard to keep it together.
[16:01.08]Because you have no idea how excited I am.
[16:05.82]And you should be too.
[16:07.54]Because.
[16:08.02]It's your brother?
[16:13.32]It could be.
[16:16.53]Is that a trench coat?
[16:17.27]That's kind of close.
[16:20.29]Needs to be fatter though.
[16:23.99]I keep thinking about grandpa.
[16:26.05]It's just Peter Griffin singing about how he's going to play the game.
[16:36.83]Never to save often because the game is prone to crashing.
[16:38.89]That's a good point.
[16:40.11]I will.
[16:42.89]That looks good.
[16:43.53]Clothing.
[16:43.85]Uh, little pants.
[16:49.52]This is formal, but I kind of want this is every day.
[16:55.11]God, okay.
[16:55.59]Alright, every day.
[16:58.57]Get these glasses off.
[17:00.49]I don't want these glasses.
[17:07.97]Well, he did have one of those Hawaiian shirts on.
[17:13.59]He's milking us.
[17:17.14]Alright, you want me to start dropping some hints for you?
[17:30.93]Something that we talked about like three years ago Like at least probably three plus years ago we had a conversation a very specific conversation about this This has been something that's been on the brain for a very long time I Like that It is not baseball
[18:03.38]God, I just love doing this.
[18:04.32]It's so fun just to create a character here and decide how I'd like them to look and put them into a place of residence.
[18:16.52]God, it's so much fun to do that.
[18:17.93]Alright, that looks good.
[18:24.65]Nobody's pregnant.
[18:25.53]What are you talking about?
[18:26.33]I'm not pregnant.
[18:26.81]What?
[18:26.97]Alright, let's get some traits.
[18:31.37]He's definitely...
[18:37.80]Commitment issues?
[18:38.70]Coward?
[18:39.74]No.
[18:41.58]Is Bugleberry evil?
[18:48.08]Not really.
[18:49.10]He has demonic powers, but I don't think he's evil.
[18:52.07]Yeah, he's a genius for sure.
[18:55.81]Ah!
[18:57.43]Well, this is young Bugleberry, right?
[19:03.59]This is before Bugleberry drank the weird potion that made him Bugleberry.
[19:07.96]He's a student at MIT, right?
[19:10.37]Whatever it is.
[19:16.25]Let's do... He's definitely brave.
[19:18.11]Charismatic.
[19:23.09]Very charismatic.
[19:24.55]I'm going to put friendly.
[19:32.82]Not inappropriate.
[19:36.06]Artie animal.
[19:39.78]Are you running for office?
[19:40.96]I'm not running for office.
[19:46.06]What was that?
[19:46.54]Did you hear that?
[19:47.04]It was like a Beavis and Butthead just laugh that just came out for no reason.
[19:52.77]He's good.
[20:05.64]Okay, we have genius, brave, charismatic.
[20:07.18]We need, like, um... Bookworm, probably?
[20:10.30]Yeah.
[20:16.91]That looks good.
[20:17.71]Lifetime wish is to be a world-renowned surgeon.
[20:19.85]That makes sense.
[20:21.17]International super spy.
[20:23.59]Um... No?
[20:25.65]A chess legend?
[20:35.35]Leader of the free world.
[20:37.11]A master mixologist.
[20:38.19]Alright, get rid of this one.
[20:41.20]Oh wait, that means booze.
[20:47.03]That does not mean what I think it is.
[20:54.17]I like mixologist, that's fine.
[20:55.37]Own a bar.
[20:56.13]It's the same thing.
[21:00.65]Oh, a forensic specialist dynamic DNA profiler.
[21:06.22]Well, now we know where that comes from.
[21:08.04]Tell us, you rat man.
[21:10.90]Just wait a minute.
[21:12.86]Just wait a minute.
[21:14.29]Just wait till we get out of the character creator.
[21:17.38]Oh, I'm so excited.
[21:18.97]I'm so excited.
[21:20.11]You have no idea.
[21:21.47]I'm holding it in.
[21:23.01]Because I... Look, this has been going on for like years.
[21:26.31]And it's finally happening.
[21:28.19]Finally.
[21:28.85]And it's real.
[21:29.51]It has a real date.
[21:31.71]And it's gonna be fucking crazy.
[21:33.89]Okay?
[21:34.45]I'm driving everybody crazy.
[21:36.44]But it's okay.
[21:36.96]Alright, that looks good.
[21:40.62]Favorites.

[21:46.98]Elas, now.
[21:47.90]Crack, crack, crack, crack.
[21:49.20]Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:50.50]Just stop smoking crack for a second.
[21:54.60]He'd probably eat this.
[21:55.88]That's pretty Bugleberry-esque.
[21:59.74]What is Bugleberry?
[22:00.76]Gemini?
[22:01.56]Capricorn?
[22:02.33]Libra?
[22:02.75]Cancer?
[22:03.11]Aries?
[22:13.90]It's not JermaCon.
[22:15.58]It's not.
[22:17.04]We'll talk a lot about it.
[22:19.29]Guys, the whole point of this stream is essentially to get everybody excited and to get me excited because I haven't talked about it at all.
[22:26.51]Wait, I'm waiting.
[22:27.49]I'm milking it.
[22:28.23]This happens to be a Pisces or whatever.
[22:36.88]I need to get rid of those glasses though.
[22:41.02]He's mega milking it.
[22:44.92]Sure.
[22:46.01]You could say that.
[22:54.23]Alright.
[22:54.69]Let's... Bugleberry, I think, is ready.
[22:57.92]Bernard Bugleberry is good to go.
[23:02.96]One other person.
[23:03.52]I don't like managing more than two people in The Sims.
[23:05.64]It's hell.
[23:09.24]That's good.
[23:09.66]Okay.
[23:10.22]Add a sim.
[23:14.30]Me?
[23:14.92]Alright, yeah.
[23:24.28]I'm going young adult.
[23:25.88]Whatever.
[23:26.28]I'm young.
[23:28.37]I can't be fatter than Bugleberry, though.
[23:29.71]That's important.
[23:35.51]What?
[23:39.43]Bernard?
[23:39.89]Yeah, it's Barry, Bernard, Bugleberry.
[23:43.35]I think.
[23:50.68]That's pretty messy.
[23:51.42]How about this one?
[23:53.14]That one's actually more accurate.
[23:55.14]That one really is pretty accurate.
[23:56.78]This is the Hillary Clinton hair.
[24:11.51]It's pretty accurate.
[24:16.87]How come I can't just make it match the color?
[24:18.53]Yeah.
[24:20.21]What do my eyebrows look like?
[24:21.09]Anime hair.
[24:29.22]Yeah, it's OC hair.
[24:31.10]It's original character hair.
[24:32.49]Alright, that looks fine.
[24:41.45]Maybe not.
[24:43.34]Eyebrows aren't that thick.
[24:56.83]I don't like that.
[24:58.27]Sideburns though.
[24:59.27]Good.
[25:01.27]Is the facecam on?
[25:05.43]I need to grab a glass of water.
[25:06.63]Wait for me to do the announcement.
[25:07.77]50 community subs.
[25:09.33]What are you doing?
[25:11.07]MysticQuest just gave 50 subs.
[25:13.27]You're out of your mind.
[25:15.02]That's too much money.
[25:19.40]Thank you though.
[25:19.92]Appreciate it.
[25:20.44]That's insane.
[25:28.55]Let's get me in here.
[25:31.95]I got... How about... My jaw is a little wide.
[25:35.07]I have a really thin chin, but I have a wide jaw.
[25:37.30]You know what I mean?
[25:39.90]That makes sense, doesn't it?
[25:40.54]This calls for a facecam?
[25:49.45]No, it doesn't.
[25:57.75]Was that game a way out?
[26:00.03]I played it with Etalyx.
[26:03.57]I'm making that guy.
[26:04.94]I don't want that guy to be in here.
[26:18.21]Just making that character.
[26:20.19]Oh, I am excited today.
[26:22.73]You understand?
[26:23.19]Okay.
[26:23.63]I almost put my hands through my monitor.
[26:25.31]Like at 355.
[26:26.05]Actually, no.
[26:29.50]My nose is bigger than that.
[26:36.78]Not that long.
[26:42.51]Yeah, because The Sims 2 didn't work.
[26:44.29]And I was like, what the fuck am I going to do about this?
[26:47.33]You want another hint?
[26:48.35]Okay.
[26:51.71]Another hint.
[26:53.03]I don't want to give the whole thing away until I have to.
[26:54.80]Alright.
[27:02.00]Purchasing.
[27:03.88]Purchasing.
[27:05.54]Buying.
[27:06.84]Purchasing.
[27:08.98]There you go.
[27:15.92]The chin's... I don't like the way the chin looks.
[27:18.83]I'm pretty smiley.
[27:20.55]Alright.
[27:21.23]Where's the chin?
[27:44.74]Details, eyes, head, and ears.
[27:46.99]Where's like my jaw?
[27:49.71]Here we go.
[28:03.88]Is it a Jerma coin?
[28:06.05]No, it's not a Jerma coin.
[28:14.23]I'm okay with this.
[28:14.86]This looks way better than I actually do, but who cares.
[28:17.32]I made myself fat, though.
[28:19.02]I got, like, a little bigger.
[28:19.90]Uh, every day... This actually kind of is already accurate.
[28:28.55]I don't think I need to change this.
[28:36.47]It looks nothing like you.
[28:37.89]It looks kind of like me.
[28:41.88]That looks sort of like me.
[28:50.42]I really like doing this, though.
[28:57.67]It's fun.
[28:58.23]Looks nothing like you.
[29:02.95]Well, then I'm going to change his name to, like, Rad Elbertson, alright?
[29:06.91]I'll change his name to Rad right now.
[29:09.07]His name is Rad.
[29:18.57]There.
[29:20.48]It's fixed.
[29:26.56]At least Rad Elbertson and Young Bugleberry are going to share like a fucking house together.
[29:31.54]Because I want something to happen.
[29:38.65]I built a house.
[29:40.89]Fucking Peter Griffin.
[29:44.95]Ugh.
[29:51.10]Okay, let's get the, uh... Yeah, we'll change the name to Rad Elbertson.
[30:02.66]Okay.
[30:04.36]Uh, those shoes have got to go.
[30:13.23]Bugleberry's first creation, Rad Elbertson.
[30:19.26]For a second, I thought that just said fermented Elbertson.
[30:21.35]I was like, who the fuck is that?
[30:24.61]Alright.
[30:25.05]Rad and Furnard are going to have a house together.
[30:30.31]Brown shoes and black pants.
[30:31.61]You can pull it off if you can do it smart enough.
[30:37.79]Okay.
[30:38.07]I think we're ready to move into a house.
[30:51.47]Rad can pull anything off.
[30:57.95]Is it announcement time?
[31:00.17]Oh, it's getting real close.
[31:02.69]I'll tell you, it's getting real close.
[31:04.55]Alright, Rad.
[31:06.83]This is going to be random.
[31:16.68]He wants to be an aquarium.
[31:18.38]That's a gigantic laptop.
[31:19.88]Holy shit.
[31:23.13]that looks good this dude loves fishing alright edit relationships they're brothers no no no no they're just housemates because Bugleberry would have made him alright let's go I don't need a place to live
[31:57.32]I want to build my own place.
[31:58.48]Can I do that?
[31:59.76]Is there a spot here where I can build?
[32:04.76]Here's a place to live.
[32:07.50]I want to move into a lot.
[32:14.54]The game is too dark.
[32:17.81]Why is it dark?
[32:18.63]That's weird.
[32:21.63]Can I afford any of these lots?
[32:28.10]It is, yeah.
[32:28.58]Why is it dark?
[32:29.24]Hold on.
[32:29.66]What's going on here?
[32:35.97]Why is it so dark?
[32:36.57]What's going on here?
[32:52.40]Yeah, it's very dark.
[32:54.08]I would say this is exceptionally dark.
[32:58.90]How do I do this?
[32:59.30]Can I make it better?
[33:06.85]Better?
[33:07.03]In case it's worse, I'll change it.
[33:11.65]Hold on.
[33:15.17]Okay.
[33:15.69]If it looks weird, let me know.
[33:17.37]I'll go back and change it again.
[33:18.17]Okay.
[33:22.49]I need a lot to move these guys into.
[33:29.72]Can I not do it at this, um, cute little library?
[33:32.28]Get out of here.
[33:33.66]Okay, I want to select the Elbertson family.
[33:38.18]And then I want to build my own.
[33:42.41]You can't start with a lot?
[33:44.45]Why not?
[33:44.83]How much is this place?
[33:54.43]Yeah, you can.
[33:55.01]Yeah, so are there any lots available?
[33:59.63]There's just no lots available in this expansion.
[34:01.11]Tell us the announcement.
[34:03.89]Hold on.
[34:06.29]We'll get it within 15 minutes.
[34:07.79]I promise.
[34:08.21]I have to go out of the city.
[34:10.84]Alright, let's go out of the city.
[34:15.28]How do I get out of here?

[34:45.58]Alright.
[34:46.19]Go ahead and start.
[34:55.21]He's a lot type.
[34:55.97]This is the best town in the game, is it?
[35:00.99]That's a park?
[35:03.99]It's not... This is a house!
[35:08.73]Wait, I have to go back?
[35:09.83]I can change the lot type to a house?
[35:13.14]Change the lot type.
[35:14.02]I want this to be residential.
[35:18.16]Okay, here's a new... Alright, nice.
[35:20.28]I'm ready.
[35:20.56]Let's move in.
[35:21.66]And I'm going to build a house.
[35:27.37]It's a copy, not one.
[35:29.72]Okay.
[35:32.14]I'm ready to move the place back into town.
[35:38.18]What the fuck?
[35:39.88]Return.
[35:40.32]Oh, it's a game setup.
[35:41.26]I see.
[35:41.42]Alright.
[35:42.96]Move in household.
[35:43.62]Here we go.
[35:46.37]Alright.

[35:48.01]They own this lot.
[35:51.67]The Elbertson family is going to move it.
[35:59.55]Alright, who do I want to... I need to build.
[36:01.45]That's fine.
[36:04.64]Okay, let's... I gotta get the hotkeys down here.
[36:09.38]So, we'll start with the walls.
[36:16.87]Go here.
[36:17.23]Let's do this.
[36:27.19]make this uh how much money do I have 16 000 is this your parents reveal alright I just need one square and then I kind of want go this way we need this
[36:58.16]Oh my fucking god, what are you doing?
[37:06.37]You start very small in The Sims, don't you understand?
[37:08.59]Okay.
[37:11.45]Um... They just need a little space.
[37:14.73]They don't need anything crazy.
[37:17.41]What the fuck is this music?
[37:20.22]What?
[37:20.60]It's The Sims!
[37:22.06]This is The Sims!
[37:24.58]Odd.
[37:28.06]I'm playing a game.
[37:29.22]I'm creating a place.
[37:30.54]I'm moving in.
[37:31.76]I'm going to be purchasing things.
[37:33.62]I'm going to be making a nice house for myself.
[37:36.06]Imagine if this was real.
[37:44.51]Can you imagine controlling somebody in what I would call a dollhouse?
[37:53.05]Directly controlling a person and all their moves and all their things.
[37:59.05]Can you imagine how interesting that would be?
[38:03.43]If you, in fact, were in control of, let's just say me, for the sake of argument.
[38:14.12]Ladies and gentlemen, wouldn't it be interesting if we did the dollhouse stream?
[38:23.40]The thing that I have talked about over and over again for three gosh darn years.
[38:30.60]We're doing the IRL dollhouse stream.
[38:33.60]You will have direct control over pretty much everything I do.
[38:39.00]There is a lot of moving parts here.
[38:41.96]We have a lot of partners.
[38:43.76]We have a lot of people.
[38:44.96]It's going to be the biggest project I've ever done.
[38:51.83]I hope everybody is prepared for that.
[38:55.81]Here are your days.
[38:58.37]This is not just one day.
[38:59.59]This is not just one stream.
[39:02.83]This is three streams.
[39:06.06]August 18th, August 20th, and August 21st.
[39:14.72]The first two streams will be at 3 p.m.
[39:16.72]Eastern.
[39:18.74]The final stream will be on at 12 p.m.
[39:23.06]Eastern.
[39:24.98]We have partnered with Twitch
[39:28.64]Twitch has ponied up a significant amount of money and funds and help and financing.
[39:36.59]Also partnering up with Kryken and his Ghost Commander company to actually make the extension.
[39:46.05]It's going to be insane.
[39:54.12]And that's happening in two weeks.
[39:56.52]You see, I held it.
[39:57.60]I held it until I get you a hard date.
[40:02.74]Let's continue.
[40:05.66]There will also be... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[40:08.00]Is that it?
[40:08.76]That's not it?
[40:09.24]There's also going to be other special guests.
[40:14.56]Which I'm sure you may hear about soon.
[40:19.87]The sky is the limit on these streams.
[40:24.70]There's a lot of really, really interesting things that are going to happen.
[40:28.48]I hope.
[40:34.40]I am so excited for it.
[40:35.66]I've been keeping my mouth shut about this for five to six months straight.
[40:42.07]I have wanted to talk about it so much.
[40:47.85]You have no idea how badly I've wanted to do that.
[40:56.41]But yes, the actual dollhouse stream is on.
[41:09.00]There will be no Bionicle.
[41:14.50]No.
[41:15.62]What?
[41:15.94]That's not... Alright, let me keep going.
[41:19.84]If you want a little bit of context on this.
[41:24.05]So, I think it was actually, I think it was offline chat one day where we were talking about this.
[41:34.80]And let me just be very, very clear about something.
[41:37.80]This is not, this is not just going to be some little basic stream where, oh yeah, I guess like he's just going to kind of do that.
[41:46.27]Like, well, like control it.
[41:48.53]You have no idea.
[41:52.25]So, I've talked about the carnival in the past, and how much time that took and how much work that took.
[41:57.97]This is the carnival probably times 10.
[42:00.03]The amount of stuff, the amount of monetary financing that went into this, the amount of people, the amount of work.
[42:06.70]It's the carnival times 10.
[42:11.21]What does purchasing and buying have to do with that?
[42:13.13]Well...
[42:16.46]Think about it.
[42:18.02]When I say you have control over most aspects, what does that mean?
[42:25.84]You're... Think about that.
[42:41.45]I'm so excited.
[42:42.46]Yeah, I'm like at the brim right now.
[42:44.78]And I knew it was going to be hard for me to like actually play.
[42:47.74]Because, oh, that's been eating me up for a long time.
[42:55.81]I don't know if people have a ton of questions, which I'm not.
[42:58.63]Trust me, I know.
[43:02.66]I know you have a lot of questions.
[43:05.34]A lot of these I can't answer because I want this to be very much a surprise.
[43:08.90]But man, if this were real, can you imagine the possibilities?
[43:15.37]Alright, let's continue.
[43:24.57]Context?
[43:25.75]Context.
[43:26.53]Context.
[43:28.53]Can you pee on command?
[43:30.61]You have to find out.
[43:32.69]You're going to have to find out at some point here.
[43:37.80]You'll have control over me and my actions.
[43:40.64]We'll see how you do.
[43:42.82]Alright, I need to do... This is going to be like the living area.
[43:48.25]No, this will be like the kitchen, living area.
[43:57.81]And another thing I wanted to say, too, we have, uh, there's so many, like, partnerships and people.
[44:04.84]Um, we are back working with Andy Mark.
[44:10.56]So many people are involved with this, it's not even funny.
[44:16.86]Network Andy has done it.
[44:24.06]And the community Jake put a shitload of time into this too.
[44:27.98]So many people have been putting time into this.
[44:29.64]It's been a wild journey.
[44:31.58]Alright, I need to do... I want like stones in here.
[44:38.49]Should I do metal?
[44:45.53]I just want like a nice gray.
[44:48.15]A nice gray like wood or linoleum, yeah.
[44:51.95]I can't just do like gray?
[44:56.18]I want gray.
[44:58.11]Get out!
[45:04.03]This'll do.
[45:04.55]One of these.
[45:04.89]How's that?
[45:06.31]That's fine.
[45:21.94]With these hands, I hold the fate of a million people.
[45:25.16]What if we tell you to end the stream?
[45:30.08]Don't worry.
[45:31.62]Don't worry.
[45:32.50]I've got it.
[45:35.41]If anything, this is going to be one of the most wild experiments we've ever done.
[45:39.07]Yeah, the scale is probably about five plus times the scale of the carnival.
[45:51.28]Uh, how about just like a, do we have like a pink, like a tile?
[45:53.78]This will be the bathroom.
[45:58.59]Uh, no, maybe like... I need like a... Oh, that's too pink.
[46:11.35]This is a massive bathroom.
[46:13.05]It is kind of a huge bathroom.
[46:17.72]We've got to get the time zones.
[46:20.11]August 18th at 3 p.m.
[46:23.01]Eastern.
[46:25.13]August 20th at 3 p.m.
[46:26.91]Eastern.
[46:28.19]August 21st at 12 p.m.
[46:30.89]Eastern.
[46:33.60]Here are your dates and times for the three dollhouse streams.
[46:37.58]What does this look like?
[46:42.86]Oh, God.
[46:43.26]That's... That's fine.
[46:45.36]It's too bad.
[46:45.66]There's a tile, right?
[46:46.89]Okay.
[46:46.99]Okay.
[46:49.60]And then I need a... Let's do this room first.
[46:52.72]I need, like, paint.
[47:03.73]Make an outhouse?
[47:09.20]12 p.m., wow.
[47:12.34]Yeah.
[47:15.54]I can answer some questions, but not very many.
[47:22.62]How do I do... I want to just do paint on the walls.
[47:25.20]How do I do that?
[47:27.08]Isn't it build mode?
[47:29.69]Walls, right?
[47:30.37]Oh, here we go.
[47:32.79]This is like a kitchen area.
[47:33.91]Let's do like just... This is really fucking ugly.
[47:41.91]Anything lighter?
[47:48.09]How is that even uglier?
[47:51.62]That's fine.
[47:56.95]Who has school in August?
[47:59.98]That's just gonna order a computer and have you sit at your desk all day.
[48:02.88]These rooms are enormous.
[48:14.99]Well, I'm trying.
[48:24.70]Mmm... Hold shift?
[48:27.30]Alright, that's right, that's right.
[48:30.92]Maybe... Hold on.
[48:32.56]Fuck, I wasn't listening.
[48:33.42]When is it happening?
[48:34.16]It's happening!
[48:34.64]Alright.
[48:35.26]August... August 18th, 20th, and 21st.
[48:39.60]There you are.
[48:44.35]I can't see what you guys are doing.
[48:45.43]Okay, now I need to do... Let's get a door on here.
[48:54.81]Doors.
[48:56.15]How about... Is this a regular door or is it a regular door?
[49:02.06]Are these external doors?
[49:09.69]Okay.
[49:20.46]That was a regular door.
[49:24.01]Need a hallway?
[49:25.67]Why do I need a hallway?
[49:26.73]I have my first house here.
[49:30.09]What is a prank-proof door?
[49:31.59]Is this open?
[49:42.24]Oh shit, I didn't paint that?
[49:48.00]Tile, there it is.
[49:53.94]Okay, that's good.
[49:54.62]Now we need some appliances.
[49:56.28]I'm just starting.
[49:59.20]Did you miss the announcement?
[50:00.16]You may have.
[50:00.70]Okay.
[50:11.50]A refrigerator.
[50:12.90]Just a standard fridge.
[50:13.66]Don't need anything crazy.
[50:14.96]How much do I have?
[50:15.64]10,000?
[50:15.66]That's good.
[50:19.30]I need a stove.
[50:23.27]That looks good.
[50:24.01]I don't need that much.
[50:25.50]We need to get jobs first.
[50:26.46]How long are the streams gonna be?
[50:28.74]Well, that depends on a few factors.
[50:33.16]That depends on how well you guys do.
[50:38.24]That depends on a few things.
[50:42.30]Um, I need a sink too, I think.
[50:43.96]Yeah.
[50:51.14]Can I just get white counter?
[51:00.15]I just want a regular counter.
[51:01.69]Just a white countertop.
[51:07.45]We need to keep you alive?
[51:10.85]Um... You'll see.
[51:14.47]Yes.
[51:16.23]I am under your control.
[51:18.29]I am your dollhouse.
[51:20.87]You're gonna have to make sure I don't fucking get murdered.
[51:25.02]You're gonna have to help me.
[51:27.80]I can't do it all on my own.
[51:31.29]That's too much responsibility.
[51:39.83]There's so many questions.
[51:40.77]I'm so excited.
[51:41.57]I can't wait.
[51:44.17]I just want a regular counter.
[51:45.53]I want just a white counter.
[51:46.95]I don't want to spend sim points.
[51:56.94]What the fuck are these counters?
[52:01.44]Oh, fucking whatever.
[52:03.88]It's still really dark for you, isn't it?
[52:05.46]I need like a little... I need a window.
[52:12.38]I need some windows.
[52:21.50]Got it on.
[52:21.96]Nightmare in-game, Jeremiah.
[52:25.09]Yeah.
[52:28.30]I feel like I'm in the middle of, like, Main Street at Disney World.
[52:31.54]I don't remember this music.
[52:40.99]The parade just isn't stopping.
[52:42.51]Okay.
[52:43.31]Put one here, too.
[52:45.29]I think it looks good.
[52:48.53]Oh, what about carpet?
[52:52.03]I need a bed, too.
[52:53.27]Alright, the bed's gonna be over here.
[52:57.71]It's like watching a boomer use a computer for the first time.
[53:00.55]Oh, yeah?
[53:01.07]Because boomer's favorite game is The Sims.
[53:03.79]It's probably The Sims 3.
[53:11.88]It's definitely not The Sims 4.
[53:12.78]Okay, let's do a bed.
[53:14.96]I don't need too much stuff.
[53:17.10]And then they can get in there.
[53:17.88]Let's do a bathroom.
[53:18.56]Almost ready.
[53:19.00]Come on, we're moving.
[53:26.86]Trying to read.
[53:27.38]I'm trying to respond to as many things as I can.
[53:29.90]Sims 3 is better than 4.
[53:31.16]You know, actually, I probably would agree with that.
[53:34.86]Alright, bed.
[53:36.14]Um... We need two beds here.
[53:39.04]At least temporarily.
[53:40.38]Because we're going to have multiple rooms soon.
[53:46.83]We just have two beds.
[53:48.01]How comfortable are these?
[53:48.79]Are these not comfortable?
[53:53.63]Energy 8.
[53:54.21]Yeah, these are fine.
[54:02.01]I need one more of those.
[54:05.53]You know what this looks like?
[54:09.37]This looks like the world's shittiest hotel.
[54:11.35]This is just you walk in, this is a hotel room.
[54:16.37]But it's a good hotel at the same time.
[54:18.81]Two twin beds?
[54:27.14]Okay.
[54:28.30]Now we see some bathroom stuff.
[54:30.08]Let's go to some toilets.
[54:34.72]Oh, I thought that was a toilet.
[54:35.86]Just a regular toilet's fine.
[54:43.58]This is huge.
[54:46.24]This bed.
[54:47.31]These are- It's too big.
[54:49.07]It's way too big.
[54:49.99]Okay.
[54:52.71]This is a massive bathroom.
[54:54.27]This could be a bedroom, too.
[54:57.61]Okay, well, whatever.
[54:58.27]It doesn't matter.
[54:58.65]I need a shower.
[55:03.79]I have it in a different style.
[55:04.81]I can.
[55:06.89]Is that going to... Yeah.
[55:10.03]I need a sink.
[55:11.55]This looks good.
[55:13.59]I need a counter, though.
[55:29.03]Why do I have to pay with seven points?
[55:30.33]That's stupid.
[55:30.81]I don't like that.
[55:33.01]I don't like that.
[55:40.13]What's going on here?
[55:46.77]What?
[55:51.01]Oh, fuck it.
[55:51.41]Whatever.
[55:51.67]Just... Okay.
[55:55.83]We're going to have a party in here.
[56:00.18]Are they gonna be waking each other up all the time?
[56:01.56]I don't think so.
[56:02.42]Alright, we have... Do everything we need just to start?
[56:04.38]I think we can start.
[56:06.56]Okay, do we like each other?
[56:10.92]Do we hate each other?
[56:11.44]Let's see.
[56:12.36]Run the bathtub around?
[56:15.02]Is it the wrong way?
[56:20.38]That's not the wrong... It was the right way.
[56:23.34]Save the game.
[56:23.86]Holy shit, you're right.
[56:25.51]Squeaky clean.
[56:26.17]This person's really clean.
[56:26.95]Alright, good.
[56:29.57]I don't have any lights.
[56:33.05]Save.
[56:41.73]Why is the bathroom so big?
[56:42.60]It's just because it is.
[56:47.02]It's a public bathroom.
[56:50.32]Is he stalling still?
[56:51.34]No, I already talked about it.
[56:52.78]Why is it taking so long to save?
[57:00.72]uh that was way too long alright uh what going here check out the new check out your place what's the uh the it's three okay don't show me this ever again
[57:28.17]This is Bugleberry's house.
[57:29.19]Do you like the toilet?
[57:30.11]Good.
[57:33.23]Okay.
[57:33.63]So, who wants to get the first job?
[57:36.33]That sounded like fucking early Kyler.
[57:44.73]Abba G.
[58:01.00]shower how come they don't share a bed because we're housemates we're not like together there are no lights I'll add lights just give me a second oh that's so ugly oh
[58:27.73]Oh, I hate it.
[58:31.73]Oh, it's the worst.
[58:33.45]I really don't like it, but I'm going to keep it.
[58:34.77]Okay, we need a light switch, right?
[58:45.85]Hey, you know a motel?
[58:48.41]Yes.
[58:49.51]Expand it by 500%.
[58:53.31]And just have all this extra space.
[58:55.91]And then put that into a house, please.
[58:57.71]These are the worst lights ever.
[58:59.43]They're fine.
[59:07.64]Where's the light switch?
[59:11.46]500 times more space.
[59:19.05]Oh, we need toilet paper.
[59:24.41]Alright, should I be evil and have it be behind?
[59:25.91]Which, by the way, the toilet paper needs to be close enough to the toilet where it's reachable, but not far away enough where you have to, like, reach behind you.
[59:40.34]I've seen this before, and I know.
[59:42.54]Fuck that.
[59:47.15]If the toilet's too close to the paper, you do the weird thing where you're unrolling the paper.
[59:51.86]And it kind of like starts touching your legs and stuff.
[59:54.38]I don't like it.
[59:56.94]Reaching behind you to get toilet paper is awful.
[60:02.78]Table, roof, ceiling, lights.
[60:06.38]I'm working on it.
[60:15.47]What about your Instagram?
[60:16.41]I don't have an Instagram.
[60:18.49]What are you talking about?
[60:32.00]Did Ludwig ever give you the bidet?
[60:33.54]No.
[60:38.80]Okay, I need to refer back to a tweet I made.
[60:40.93]I think I made this tweet like eight years ago.
[60:46.08]I only have like one or two pieces of social media.
[60:49.08]It's my Twitter, and here, and like YouTube.
[60:53.60]Don't refer to the tweet I made like seven years ago about accounts that I don't have, that I don't own, that were just made.
[60:58.65]I don't, I don't know what they are.
[61:00.45]That was three.
[61:13.08]You forgot about Discord.
[61:14.14]Alright, let's keep going.
[61:20.78]Can I do a bidet recommendation?
[61:22.60]Ludwig, I think, is going to give me a good one.
[61:25.63]He has an exact one that he was going to do.
[61:27.31]He knows exactly which one to give me.
[61:28.71]That's what he said.
[61:29.49]What was that radish tweet?
[61:34.31]I like radishes.
[61:34.97]I don't know.
[61:36.61]It made me laugh that I had that many on the plate.
[61:38.81]People were really concerned about that tweet, by the way.
[61:44.38]Dude, what the fuck?
[61:45.76]You don't eat this, right?
[61:47.66]Yeah, I did.
[61:48.22]I ate all of that.
[61:50.12]It was good.
[61:51.06]I like radishes, and I like sandwiches.
[61:53.68]It just, like, looked really sad.
[61:55.12]I don't know.
[61:58.08]It was a way to, like, uh... That's, like, what you're... That's, like, what you send to your mother to prove that you're eating.
[62:07.11]You know, like, oh, you're at college, honey.
[62:08.89]Well, how are you doing?
[62:10.49]Ma, look, I'm fine.
[62:11.35]Okay.
[62:11.45]Okay.
[62:16.92]Are you eating?
[62:18.26]Yes, I'm eating.
[62:19.32]Okay, let's keep going.
[62:25.23]I want to do... What else do I actually... Oh, yeah, lights.
[62:31.17]Everyone was mad about lights.
[62:37.38]Ceiling lights.
[62:41.08]Let's be against a wall.
[62:41.90]I don't think I can... Oh, no, no, no.
[62:42.96]Roof.
[62:43.16]Somebody needs to put a roof on.
[62:44.02]Roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof.
[62:47.15]Here, look.
[62:48.31]I feel like this is what Pee-Wee's Playhouse looks like from the outside.
[63:00.48]How about just sand?
[63:08.26]Oh my goodness.
[63:09.04]I have a fairy tale character lives in here.
[63:16.91]Alright, that's fine.
[63:17.59]I don't need it.
[63:18.19]Okay, roof is done.
[63:25.01]Alright, get this off.
[63:33.75]How do I get the roof off?
[63:39.29]Wall's down.
[63:40.39]Wall's cut away, right?
[63:41.57]Okay, there we go.
[63:46.62]This is your first Minecraft house?
[63:48.02]It kind of is.
[63:50.28]What is going on here?
[63:51.22]How do I get out of this?
[63:55.52]How come the walls aren't cutting away?
[63:57.21]Down, cut away, up.
[64:02.29]Walls up, walls down.
[64:03.95]Walls cut away.
[64:06.57]Do page down?
[64:07.83]Oh, shit.
[64:11.60]Wait, what?
[64:16.30]Oh, I see what you mean.
[64:19.36]Okay.
[64:21.02]Alright.
[64:21.92]That's Will Ferrell elf music.
[64:23.47]They've been just talking out here for like four hours.
[64:26.45]Alright.
[64:34.85]Where is... Alright.
[64:39.40]Somebody... Where's their thing that says how good they're doing?
[64:43.90]Here it is.
[64:45.83]Alright, fun.
[64:46.45]We need some fun stuff.
[64:48.87]Outdoors.
[64:50.45]You buy a car?
[64:52.00]What?
[64:53.82]Sloppy jalopy?
[64:55.00]I kind of want a car.
[64:58.42]I want a sloppy jalopy.
[64:59.56]Alright.
[65:02.27]How about a TV?
[65:03.81]Yeah, that makes sense, doesn't it?
[65:13.31]Sort by function, appliances, entertainment.
[65:17.72]Redville.
[65:21.34]You know, can I just like sort stuff by alphabetically?
[65:23.62]I don't like having like 40 tabs open.
[65:27.16]Like I just, there's like five different, 10 different subcategories.
[65:30.50]I just want like a list of stuff.
[65:33.96]Bathroom, bedroom, living room.
[65:35.62]You're gonna have to have a cheap TV.
[65:48.78]And then a little couch.
[65:50.84]That's fine.
[65:58.23]Big motel.
[66:02.23]How do you like that?
[66:03.66]Let's move.
[66:04.38]Oh, get the paper.
[66:05.12]Let's find a job.
[66:15.45]give them bedroom walls like a divider alright read it available jobs Rad Elbertson I think should be doing I mean that's perfect 25 bucks an hour they look like coffins they do look like coffins
[66:42.10]Also, something else that I want to make sure I make very clear to everybody.
[66:46.80]So, because... So, Twitch... This is another part of the whole stream going on.
[66:53.65]So, Twitch is giving us a significant amount of money to do this stream coming up here in a couple weeks.
[66:59.57]And one of the things that were kind of our agreement with them was we were going to run ads.
[67:05.53]So, they're going to be ads on those streams and pretty much until the stream happens.
[67:12.84]So what we're going to do, I'm going to try to do this in as non-aggregious way as I possibly can.
[67:20.48]So what we're probably going to end up doing is on BRBs for the next... It's not going to happen on the next stream, but it'll happen this stream.
[67:30.01]We'll probably do a couple minutes of ads, two or three minutes of ads.
[67:36.33]So that's part of our agreement with Twitch.
[67:39.47]And they have, I will tell you,
[67:43.62]That's for the amount of money and the amount of help that Twitch has given us for this.
[67:51.14]It's worth doing.
[67:51.96]It is.
[67:53.18]So, I want to see if I can test to see if it works.
[68:02.19]So, we're going to test it right now.
[68:03.53]Because if I can't get it to work...
[68:07.65]Uh, I'm going to be a little concerned.
[68:09.99]So let me make sure.
[68:11.88]We are going to do, right now, I'm going to go pee.
[68:16.32]I actually haven't peed in like three hours, so.
[68:18.38]We're going to run two minutes of ads right now.
[68:21.22]And hopefully it works.
[68:22.48]Because this is a good place to test it.
[68:23.82]Because I need to make sure this actually is going to work for the actual days.
[68:30.94]Let's give it a check.
[68:31.70]Let's try it.
[68:32.96]I'll be right back.
[68:33.52]I'm going to go pee.
[68:34.50]I'm going to get another probably coffee or so.
[68:37.96]And we'll try it out.
[68:39.38]Let me know if you don't apologize.
[68:42.75]Well, I want you guys to have a good experience.
[68:47.01]And everybody else does too.
[68:48.99]So I'm going to try to do this the best way I can.
[68:52.13]I'll be right back in five minutes.
[68:55.19]We'll try two minutes and see how it goes.
[72:02.64]okay hello uh so how'd it go did anybody see them did you guys see the ads did some did people see them I want to make sure it works depends okay I got two okay uh and I want to just take a second I know this stream has been a lot this has not necessarily been a like sim stream as much as it had been hey here's what's happening I want to give you guys enough notice to
[72:30.08]But this is very important.
[72:33.08]I am not going to make any money from this event at all.
[72:38.09]I'm not going to be able to take a cent from any of this.
[72:41.93]All of this is going to go towards production.
[72:46.29]Make sure people are being paid.
[72:48.64]I'm not taking a dollar from this.
[72:50.92]Because I can't.
[72:51.74]Because that's how we have a good show.
[72:54.20]So if you're wondering, Twitch has given us a significant amount of money, but
[73:00.23]All of it, and then some, is going to be spent solely on the show.
[73:07.89]I want people to know that.
[73:09.77]So if people maybe think that like, oh man, what's this fucking deal he's got?
[73:13.40]How many people?
[73:14.10]He's probably making bank.
[73:16.32]No, I am not.
[73:17.56]This is to make sure that we have enough money to be able to do the show.
[73:21.02]I'm not going to be taking any money.
[73:22.96]It will be probably impossible.
[73:26.39]If you have no context, I'll give you a little bit of context.
[73:28.35]We're doing a dollhouse.
[73:30.62]Well, you will control me for three streams.
[73:34.14]We have an amazing extension team.
[73:37.14]This is not going to just be a click map, guys.
[73:40.70]This is a custom-built extension created for this stream.
[73:50.39]But running ads is something that I have, you know, I'm trying to do my best with it, right?
[73:57.62]And just to let everybody know, this is only for this broadcast stuff.
[74:04.95]I'm not planning on running ads in a permanent setting.
[74:11.00]But just so you know, I'm not going to see anything from this.
[74:14.86]Well, I am going to see something from this.
[74:17.14]You know what I'm going to see from this?
[74:19.76]I'm going to see an insanely fun experiment.
[74:24.06]I'm going to see a bunch of people put together something that hopefully is crazy to experience.
[74:31.21]So I want to make that clear.
[74:37.13]You can...
[74:41.43]Oh man, he's probably making bank.
[74:45.17]No.
[74:46.87]And I'm incredibly excited.
[74:48.19]I'm very... Nervous is probably not the right word because I'm just kind of bottled up.
[74:53.22]I've been trying to... I've been holding on to this for a long time.
[74:55.28]There's been so much work.
[74:58.78]But I'm very, very excited.
[75:00.58]I hope it's as fun as I think it's going to be.
[75:03.84]August 18th.
[75:04.12]August 20th.
[75:05.24]August 21st.
[75:08.89]Give us more ads.
[75:10.95]You will.
[75:12.13]You'll probably get them every 45 minutes to an hour or so, maybe, I think, is when we're probably going to try to run them.
[75:22.61]But, yeah.
[75:23.83]Wanted to make that clear.
[75:24.75]Let's continue to just chill and hang out.
[75:28.70]I will answer some more questions if you'd like to hear about them.
[75:37.89]And let's go.
[75:39.21]Back to the game.
[75:44.87]Hope you become a billionaire.
[75:46.43]I don't want to become a billionaire.
[75:48.37]No, thank you.
[75:49.31]That sounds... I don't want that.
[75:51.77]That's too much.
[75:52.53]Alright.
[75:57.78]Rad should take that.
[76:01.76]Monday, Tuesday.
[76:03.16]Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[76:06.03]25 bucks an hour to start.
[76:07.05]Holy shit.
[76:07.47]Alright, yeah, let's do it.
[76:08.21]Alright, what about, uh, what about, uh, Bugleberry?
[76:16.07]Wait, did I put, like, a little divider here?
[76:22.74]Remember, you owe me money after you crashed the jetpack.
[76:28.12]Am I paying for your jetpack?
[76:33.45]Don't ever let me use a jetpack.
[76:35.03]What are you talking about?
[76:35.77]Pay him back.
[76:37.41]I didn't break anybody's jetpack.
[76:43.42]Oh, shit.
[76:44.84]Okay, hold on.
[76:49.24]We need a divider here.
[76:50.24]Is this going to work?
[77:02.24]That's not gonna work.

[130:24.07]Okay.
[130:25.91]Still this cooking competition that I have to do.
[130:28.68]Unfinished room?
[130:31.60]What's wrong with this place?
[130:33.44]How is it unfinished?
[130:39.26]What makes this unfinished?
[130:47.38]Which wall is not finished?
[130:48.73]It's the bathroom wall?
[130:58.99]This one over here.
[130:59.45]Head in.
[131:00.43]That's 10 mood.
[131:00.99]Is it the outside of the house that they're talking about?
[131:07.92]All Thanos.
[131:08.44]No.
[131:08.70]Inside, right?
[131:30.51]I just started Attack on Titan.
[131:31.55]Can you please say Aaron?
[131:32.55]I used to hate it, but now I think it's funny.
[131:35.69]Now you like it.
[131:37.25]Now you think it's funny, don't you?
[131:41.27]Now you want me to do Aaron.
[131:44.91]I got a lot of shit for that.
[131:57.54]A lot of shit.
[132:05.71]Do the roar.
[132:06.43]What's up with the bathroom sink?
[132:14.18]Ugh.
[132:15.20]Yeah, what is up with the bathroom sink?
[132:16.70]It's fucking disgusting.
[132:22.10]I get one point at least, so I can impress the guy.
[132:24.44]Got it.
[132:30.99]Okay, good.
[132:32.37]Asics of Piano.
[132:36.33]You can stop, stop, stop.
[132:37.35]Go to bed.
[132:40.83]Do I need food?
[132:41.39]No, I need to sleep.
[132:42.03]Alright.
[132:42.81]You're done.
[132:44.96]Aaron!
[132:45.30]There it is.
[132:45.70]Alright.
[132:46.22]We did it.
[132:46.66]I mean, I half-assed it, but I did it.
[133:09.31]Do it again.
[133:09.79]Do it full power.
[133:15.80]Alright.
[133:16.70]Fine.
[133:19.84]Aaron!
[133:20.48]Aaron!
[133:21.24]Aaron!
[133:22.12]Aaron!
[133:24.37]You know, I saw a thread somewhere that said that I'm actually kind of sad that he has not done that in a while.
[133:30.77]I was like, man, I actually kind of missed that he did that.
[133:35.06]Like,
[133:37.37]He hasn't done it like two or three weeks.
[133:38.89]I might kind of miss it.
[133:40.09]Well, there you go.
[133:43.51]84 bucks.
[133:43.77]Pay the bills.
[133:54.10]Oh, by the way, I can't wait to do the Battleship Tournament.
[133:55.88]That's probably... I think that's happening this week.
[133:59.94]I want to say Thursday or Friday.
[134:01.36]I got to confirm that with Ludwig.
[134:04.24]I'm in the semi-final.
[134:05.30]I moved on.
[134:07.89]Continuing my quest to continue to win in the battleship tournament.
[134:12.05]Alright, it's time for everybody to get up.
[134:19.02]Who cares, Omega Lull?
[134:22.46]Well, whatever.
[134:24.00]It's fine.
[134:26.82]You need a fucking garbage can.
[134:28.24]Alright, hold on.
[134:38.79]I need a garbage can.
[134:39.83]Is this video game consoles?
[134:50.25]Alright, this thing's like 10 bucks.
[134:55.47]I'm at 25 dollars for a garbage can.
[134:57.81]Are you kidding me?
[135:00.03]Is it really that expensive?
[135:01.19]This is like 10 years ago too.
[135:02.37]Let's go.
[135:15.83]But it's sad.
[135:16.21]Jerma really is just a sussy guy at this point.
[135:17.97]He has no sharp perspective.
[135:19.43]He just complies with whatever chat says.
[135:22.65]It really makes me sad.
[135:27.74]If you missed the announcement, I will give you an announcement of the last announcement.
[135:32.28]We were doing a three-day dollhouse stream.
[135:35.66]You guys get to control me in a house.
[135:39.72]We have an incredibly extensive extension that is being made, custom-built for this purpose.
[135:47.47]It's going to be a three-day event.
[135:51.73]You guys will have a ton of control over pretty much everything.
[136:01.01]And the people that are working on the extension is Ghost Commander, which is Kryken and Kryken's team.
[136:06.15]If you've been aware of any of the things they've done before, they're putting a lot of time into this.
[136:19.11]What did you do?
[136:20.45]You burnt it.
[136:22.51]That was disgusting.
[136:32.82]On top of that, we also have Andy Mark.
[136:35.76]Is participating completely.
[136:38.14]They're on board as a full... They're doing everything.
[136:43.70]We've got this trifecta team.
[136:48.70]Yeah, Andy Mark is back.
[136:52.27]There are a lot more people on this project than any of the ones ever that you've ever seen here.
[136:58.79]Twitch is involved.
[137:02.41]We have a significant amount of financing from Twitch.
[137:07.96]This is the big one.
[137:13.32]Practice the piano.
[137:14.12]He's still sleeping.
[137:26.00]Five bucks.
[137:31.07]Did you get vaccinated because you chose to get vaccinated?
[137:33.99]Uh, yes.
[137:37.01]Part of the... I mean, obviously... This project has a lot of people on it.
[137:43.07]And... I'm not fucking around.
[137:45.05]There's gonna be a significant amount of people.
[137:55.24]That are going to be coming and going through this whole project.
[137:58.04]So we're trying to err on the side of complete caution.
[138:00.52]Trying to get everybody vaccinated before the project.
[138:03.46]Because I ain't fucking around.
[138:14.57]Why'd you get J&J?
[138:17.17]I got J&J because... By the time... That the project was going to be... I mean, August 18th, right?
[138:26.14]If I had gotten one of the mRNA vaccines, I would have had to get the second dose way too close to the project.
[138:33.43]And I am not taking the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and getting wiped out from like two, three, four, five days of side effects.
[138:44.41]Like the week of the stream, because that's when it would have to line up.
[138:50.78]Like, can you imagine, like, oh, it's August, like, 16th.
[138:53.98]Time for your second dose of, like, Pfizer.
[138:57.90]And the stream is in fucking two days.
[139:01.17]I got the J&J vaccine, and it wiped me out for, like, four days.
[139:06.65]I had a high fever.
[139:07.53]I felt, like, wicked sloppy.
[139:09.49]Oh, yeah.
[139:10.55]So I was trying to make sure I could avoid any side effects.
[139:13.41]And I'm glad I was able to do that.
[139:17.74]Have you been reacting to electronics at all, weirdly?
[139:25.87]No, I can't say I have.
[139:28.85]How does 5G taste?
[139:31.69]Alright, they hate this room.
[139:39.08]I gotta fix it.
[139:40.92]The social is fine.
[139:52.94]JNJ knocked me out too.
[139:55.10]Yeah, and I know we've got a bunch... What are you doing?
[139:59.97]Why are you watching this?
[140:02.67]This is weird.
[140:10.59]I completely forgot what we were just talking about.
[140:15.20]Oh, it's because of the one and done thing, but the whole thing with the Delta variant now.
[140:20.46]We're still trying to figure out how effective everything is.
[140:24.72]Is it... Are we going to need boosters?
[140:26.70]Should you take a booster?
[140:28.00]When should you do it?
[140:28.60]It's getting fit.
[140:38.58]But the one thing that I can say as being vaccinated, at least, at the very least, there will be enough immunity built up for me not to have a major, major problem.
[140:50.78]Right?
[140:51.00]Because I think you can still technically what they call a breakthrough infection, right?
[140:56.87]If you do get it, then the theory is that you've built up some antibodies, at least for your body to fight it and understand what it is, so you don't end up in the hospital.
[141:07.59]Right?
[141:09.95]So maybe if you get COVID, you kind of feel like shit for a few days.
[141:13.41]Three, four, five days or something.
[141:14.69]But it keeps you out of the hospital and keeps a ventilator off your body.
[141:19.68]And I've got medical problems, guys.
[141:23.44]I'm sure you're aware.
[141:25.50]I have all kinds of weird shit going on.
[141:28.90]I don't want to fucking end up in the hospital.
[141:39.69]I have colitis.
[141:42.45]I have this mystery fucking chest pain.
[141:44.51]I don't want to end up in the hospital.
[142:06.43]And plus, I've got to be really honest too, right?
[142:10.86]When, after I got the vaccine, one of the things that I was always kind of concerned about and just kind of freaked out, and everybody can relate to this, I think.
[142:18.18]Anytime you're out anywhere, if you've like, oh, I'm going to the grocery store, I'm at the, I'm in the bread aisle, and you just like hear two aisles over like, like, what the fuck was that?
[142:28.84]What was that, motherfucker?
[142:29.95]Who was that?
[142:31.21]I'm out of here.
[142:31.57]I gotta go.
[142:31.89]I gotta get the fuck out of here immediately.
[142:34.29]I am running this other direction.
[142:36.37]I don't care if I need bread.
[142:37.15]I'll get it.
[142:37.47]I'll get it tomorrow, right?
[142:41.03]At least kind of gives me that, at least mental security that, okay, I have some exposure to the virus.
[142:50.20]If I hear anybody do that, I instantly just go the other direction.
[142:55.70]You hear like a... Go!
[142:59.02]Turn!
[142:59.42]Turn!
[143:01.34]And you look back, you're like, fuck.
[143:03.32]Who the fuck was that?
[143:04.74]God damn it, what are you doing here?
[143:09.25]So it helps with that.
[143:10.21]It helps kind of not make you have to freak out every time you hear that.
[143:16.85]Touching any surface too.
[143:18.31]It's like, oh, hold on.
[143:19.71]Let me get that door for you.
[143:22.81]I just touched it.
[143:23.39]I touched the door.
[143:24.07]I touched that.
[143:25.03]I touched the door.
[143:25.99]Now I'm in trouble.
[143:27.75]Great.
[143:28.93]I gotta go wash my hands now.
[143:35.14]I've been doing this to Dine and Dash for the past year.
[143:43.25]Wait, wait, hold on a minute.
[143:44.33]Hold on.
[143:44.69]Wait.
[143:45.69]You... You've been dining and dashing because you hear somebody... Like, what are you talking about?
[143:50.91]That's fucked up, man.
[144:06.43]That's wicked fucked up.
[144:12.19]What happened to my game?
[144:15.89]my game block hold on wait wait oh there we go okay but anyways the point I'm making is it gives me at least enough comfort in my brain and I'd have to constantly then look I know that there's still risk there is right
[144:45.46]But it definitely makes me feel a little bit better.
[144:46.58]Save the game.
[144:48.22]Oh, shit, you're right.
[144:51.88]Alright, now it's time to run some ads.
[144:55.29]Those of you that missed... I just, like, choked on... I'm fine.
[145:03.87]I just, like, choked on myself.
[145:05.90]Cringe ads?
[145:06.72]I know.
[145:07.70]I know.
[145:12.90]Uh, we're gonna run.
[145:13.60]I'm gonna go BRB again.
[145:14.83]I'll be back.
[145:16.71]I'm outta here.
[145:17.25]No, no, I gotta go.
[145:18.85]No, because I just...
[145:20.77]I'm fine.
[145:22.15]Don't run away.
[145:22.81]Okay, so we're going to run some ads.
[145:25.69]Those of you that weren't here before, I want to make sure that you're aware.
[145:30.02]Because Twitch has a significant financial involvement, they've given a lot of financial help for the streams coming up here in the next couple weeks.
[145:38.26]This is part of the agreement is to run ads.
[145:40.64]Every hour or so, we're going to run some.
[145:43.26]This is not a permanent solution.
[145:45.06]This is not a permanent thing for this channel.
[145:50.53]This is just for the next, I'd say, couple of weeks.
[145:54.07]Again, I want to make it really clear again for those of you that weren't, we're not here.
[145:58.67]I'm not going to make any money from these streams.
[146:01.81]Absolute zero.
[146:03.81]I will not be making anything at all.
[146:07.87]This is just to make sure the production can go through without a hitch.
[146:10.73]So I'm going to go BRB.
[146:11.47]We're going to run a few minutes of ads and I will be right back.
[146:14.65]Thanks for watching.
[146:15.45]I'll be right back.
[150:18.49]Okay.
[150:20.70]I have returned.
[150:25.10]So, I need to... Alright, there we go.
[150:30.08]Mystery chest pain question centered or more on one side?
[150:32.76]It goes right through the middle of my body.
[150:38.11]I would say it affects the middle left.
[150:40.81]And that goes all the way through the back around my flank.
[150:45.05]Had a lot of tests.
[150:46.83]Still trying to figure it out.
[150:49.96]Alright, let's keep going.
[150:56.15]How long each day of streaming?
[150:59.83]We're going to have to gauge it because with the nature of you guys being able to do pretty much, there's a lot of shit you guys are going to be able to do.
[151:09.16]Give us more ads.
[151:09.92]Give us more.
[151:10.30]Alright, I will.
[151:10.74]I will.
[151:12.27]I have to be better about running them because I'm supposed to run them more frequently than I am, but we start talking about stuff that I kind of like.
[151:21.18]Oh, right.
[151:21.76]What?
[151:22.16]I forgot.
[151:23.46]Ads.
[151:32.10]Alright.
[151:32.66]Let's go back to the game.
[151:34.41]Okay.
[151:34.71]Remind me in like a half an hour.
[151:36.67]Okay.
[151:36.85]Okay.
[151:40.70]Remind me in like 35 minutes.
[151:42.28]Change category to ads.
[151:55.37]Get your timers ready.
[151:58.42]He's getting better.
[152:13.82]You should ask for Prime.
[152:17.03]No, I don't.
[152:17.95]I don't.
[152:19.77]If you sub to the channel, you do.
[152:21.09]If you don't, you don't.
[152:21.89]I'm not concerned with that at all.
[152:30.61]Changed the category to ants.
[152:32.53]Oh, is he playing so slow and fast forward?
[152:34.61]I'm... What do you mean?
[152:35.57]What?
[152:36.47]I'm waiting for... I'm waiting for the points.
[152:40.17]Your fitness instructor taught you to seek variety.
[152:43.39]Work out using the TV or stereo for... Go for a jog and swim for 30 minutes.
[152:47.53]I don't have a pool.
[152:57.90]Oh, shit.
[152:58.28]Go here.
[152:58.56]Yeah.
[152:58.97]Yeah, yeah.
[153:00.61]Can I go there?
[153:01.95]That sounds pretty easy.
[153:02.63]Alright, work out in front of the TV.
[153:08.75]Do some cardio.
[153:10.09]30 minutes.
[153:11.97]No, not you.
[153:12.87]Not you, you buffoon.
[153:14.20]Not you.
[153:15.28]Well, actually, both of you can do it.
[153:18.14]No, get out of here.
[153:18.76]Go back to the piano.
[153:22.28]Okay.
[153:30.32]Too fatigued?
[153:33.44]Oh, fine.
[153:33.82]Do it tomorrow.
[153:43.04]I still need to- Okay, just take any recipe.
[153:44.74]Whatever he makes.
[153:45.36]I didn't even make it.
[153:46.12]Who cares?
[153:46.51]Put it in your inventory.
[153:47.21]Oh, God.

[154:11.07]Wait, we're in love?
[154:11.93]You want to hang out?
[154:22.73]This is like a, this is a porn.

[154:25.34]Okay.
[154:25.60]Let's have a little chat.
[154:27.76]Um.
[154:49.18]Okay.
[154:51.98]How are you doing?
[154:54.12]Let's compliment personality.
[154:55.72]Bernard learned that Stacy is a snob.

[155:50.55]You go finish dinner.
[155:53.01]Replace for $400?
[155:54.01]That's not going to happen.
[156:02.50]Can I use the burnt stove?
[156:06.86]Single?
[156:07.50]Alright, are we gonna be able to like hook up while she's here for the fire?
[156:34.01]What's wrong?
[156:42.70]Do you want to stay over?
[156:44.56]There's burnt waffles in the fridge.
[157:02.54]Don't puke in front of her.
[157:04.10]Don't puke in front of her.
[157:05.46]Anything but that.
[157:10.34]You want to stay over?
[157:11.22]Are we on a date?
[157:13.52]Get out of here.
[157:15.01]Stacey thinks Bernard is being flirty.
[157:32.05]I just started kissing.
[157:37.58]I gotta get these.
[157:38.28]I gotta get these.
[157:38.76]I gotta get a bed.
[157:39.42]I better get a bed.
[157:43.24]Group conversation?
[157:44.24]No.
[157:44.56]Fuck off.
[157:47.84]Mm.
[157:49.21]Mm.
[157:49.27]Mm.
[158:03.22]Confess attraction.
[158:09.75]Hold on one second.
[158:18.93]Whoa.
[158:21.02]Everybody has to use the bathroom.
[158:25.02]Get out of the way.
[158:26.44]Get out of the way.
[158:28.32]Get out of the way.
[158:29.82]Get out of the way.
[158:33.15]Get out of the way.
[158:33.94]Get out of the way.
[158:38.26]What is he looking at?
[158:41.96]I have an idea.

[170:10.19]But I need to... We need to stop.
[170:16.59]Take a shower.
[170:17.25]I'm going to get ready.
[170:17.88]I'm going to take a nap.
[170:22.32]Why is she brushing her teeth for so long?
[170:27.54]Vile surroundings.
[170:30.34]Ugh!
[170:32.11]What's wrong?
[170:35.69]Who smells?
[170:36.57]Oh, it's him.
[170:37.09]You smell.
[170:41.53]Get in there.
[170:42.05]Somebody clean his toilet.
[170:51.29]Why do you live here?
[170:52.65]She just lives here.
[170:56.62]What are we doing?
[171:00.54]Alright, I need this.
[171:05.90]You have to fix this.
[171:06.82]Fix it.
[171:12.27]Fix the toilet.
[171:14.65]Whatever.
[171:15.09]Alright, you fix the toilet.
[171:16.07]Somebody has to fix this.
[171:16.69]It's disgusting in here.
[171:27.76]Okay, clean it.
[171:31.96]This is just gross.
[171:34.48]Clean this up.
[171:37.18]Clean the sink.
[171:40.71]Alright.
[171:41.47]This is not going to be so disgusting in here now.
[171:50.14]Time for ads?
[171:52.08]Let me check.
[171:55.68]Save it first.
[172:02.78]It's been 15 minutes?
[172:03.98]Yeah, it hasn't been long enough.
[172:12.04]Oh no, don't eat that.
[172:14.97]Why are we still eating the same burnt waffles?
[172:19.15]Oh.
[172:21.59]She... Holy shit.
[172:27.98]Alright, for a second I thought she was going to get a fire engine and I would have laughed really hard.
[172:35.04]That's the first time she's left since coming to put the fire out.
[172:41.05]Alright, we got some... We're good to go.
[172:42.51]I need to go home now.
[172:43.81]Okay.
[172:44.57]Well, now we're dating.
[172:50.81]Clean.
[172:51.19]Okay, I need to make something.
[172:56.84]Serve breakfast.
[172:59.56]Waffles.
[172:59.98]Waffles.
[173:02.50]And then I'm going to bring the waffles, put them in my inventory, and serve it.
[173:12.97]Eventually.
[173:13.43]I thought the bed was on fire.
[173:20.29]I was like, what the hell?
[173:26.03]Just wait for the next alarm and she will live there.
[173:36.43]What's wrong with the fridge?
[173:39.87]I see gas coming out of the fridge.
[173:50.02]Big bits?
[173:52.04]Yeah, as of... As of like a year ago or seven or eight months ago or so, I no longer read bits.
[174:02.16]I mean, I read them.
[174:04.11]It's not on stream.
[174:10.53]We talked about a while ago why that was.
[174:12.19]There's a few reasons why.
[174:23.70]Huge bits ignored ads, not ran.
[174:26.36]You're a monster.
[174:36.13]No, we talked about this because it used to be... I mean, there's a lot of people that are potentially new here.
[174:41.86]So, we'll go over it very quickly.
[174:44.82]It used to be that anything over... I think it was 250 in bits, I would read at the end of the stream.
[174:50.10]We'd have like a hangout session.
[174:52.41]But over the years, I kind of wanted to...
[174:56.70]There's two main reasons why it was pretty much 50-50.
[174:59.03]I want to stop incentivizing people to have to pay for me to talk to them or read what they said.
[175:07.59]I don't want you to have to give me 50 bucks for me to read what you said.
[175:12.91]It's a lot of money.
[175:13.59]100 bucks, 50 bucks, 20 bucks.
[175:15.77]That's a lot of money.
[175:17.62]And I would rather not incentivize people to spend a bunch of money with the hope that I would read their message.
[175:27.68]It just kind of makes me uncomfortable.
[175:30.56]And the second part is because those end of the stream segments used to be sometimes two hours long, where we would just sit there and hang out and just talk.
[175:43.65]So that's why I kind of got rid of it.
[175:49.04]You're an anti-money streamer.
[175:51.80]No, I'm not.
[175:53.04]Not really.
[175:53.85]I mean, I just... I just don't want to like encourage and incentivize people to drop like a hundred bucks for me to look over and read what you said.
[176:04.19]That's such an extreme amount of money.
[176:06.47]And what was happening was I was reading the big ones.
[176:10.51]So I was like, oh, well, I got rid of the little ones, like $250, but I'll read the ones that are like $100.
[176:16.05]That's a lot of money, right?
[176:17.19]I'm going to read it.
[176:18.65]And it was incentivizing people to spend $100.
[176:23.51]I don't want you to have to spend $100 to have me read your message.
[176:26.03]Somebody clean the fridge, for God's sakes.
[176:29.45]Come on.
[176:36.25]Clean out bad food.
[176:37.13]Here we go.
[176:39.26]Stop looking at it.
[176:39.96]What are you doing?
[176:40.68]That's how you make sure it doesn't cook at all.
[176:47.69]This thing can't even preheat.
[177:01.02]And I still read out community subs sometimes.
[177:02.97]Like, somebody gave 50 community subs before.
[177:05.39]But I think the difference between saying, like, thanks for, like, the 50 community subs, right, is people in the community are getting a sub.
[177:13.83]You're able to, uh, the sub-only stuff, you're able to do the emotes, and it's a little bit more tangible than just, you just gave me, like, a $500 or something.
[177:26.62]But I've struggled with that for a long time.
[177:29.12]Of trying to figure out... If people give you a bunch of money, it's like, oh shit, that's a lot of fucking money.
[177:35.37]Thanks for the... That's an extreme amount of money.
[177:40.37]I've always been essentially more comfortable people treating this stream like you would treat something like Netflix.
[177:47.41]You know?
[177:48.35]Like, oh, it's just... If you want to give $5 a month, you can.
[177:53.48]You don't have to.
[177:55.10]I don't expect anybody to.
[177:57.44]But, I don't, it's not like, okay, so if you had like a Netflix subscription, you're also not giving Netflix like 50 more dollars a month because you want to, right?
[178:06.10]You just, yeah, I guess it's 10 bucks a month or whatever, right?
[178:15.13]Oh, dude, free Netflix.
[178:16.31]Are you serious?
[178:19.05]But I don't want anyone to ever think they have to give this channel money.
[178:23.46]you don't have to there's no reason for you to do so if you do it's beyond my wildest expectations that people would pay five plus dollars to this stream every month it's insane so I just don't I don't want people to think that they have to give money to this channel so it's time for some ads
[179:04.16]I wonder how many subs you just picked up with this conversation.
[179:07.06]And that's why I never like to really talk about this that frequently.
[179:10.59]Because I haven't been to work once.
[179:12.75]This character's not been to work one time.
[179:14.47]And I'm not going to get fired because I'm not going to answer the phone.
[179:17.90]So, you know, thinking face.
[179:21.16]Oh, he got a raise.
[179:36.82]The piano will leave you alone.
[179:39.36]Oh, don't answer the phone.
[179:44.40]Just don't answer it.
[179:58.25]Oh, shit.
[179:58.59]The waffles.
[179:59.15]Alright.
[180:01.15]Once I get this next point in music.
[180:08.23]Okay, put in, put away, how do I put it in my inventory?
[180:21.46]Oh shit, you got a bonus.
[180:22.92]Alright, go to the bathroom quick.
[180:27.85]So you got promoted.
[180:30.78]Congratulations.
[180:31.30]Rad's impressive performance has earned him a promotion to a roadie.
[180:34.80]The band is going to need their sandwiches and soda as soon as possible.
[180:38.00]Don't forget to pick up their laundry.
[180:40.68]That's right.
[180:41.20]Rad is the music career.
[180:42.62]I'm the chef career.
[180:43.60]Yet Rad has more cooking points and I have more music points.
[180:47.75]Don't go to work.
[180:50.99]Three hours late for work and you're going to go?
[180:55.15]They're like four hours late.
[180:58.71]No, there's no way I'm going to work.
[181:05.31]The day is almost over.
[181:19.50]I think I actually work at the diner.
[181:25.84]Yeah, here I am.
[181:29.73]The chefs at the restaurant were eagerly awaiting your entry, but you astounded all with your lack of effort.
[181:34.29]Don't make empty promises, especially when it comes to delicious food.
[181:42.79]Alright, time to leave.
[181:43.67]I was only there for like 40 minutes.
[181:54.53]Earned $29 today?
[182:00.01]Holy shit, what's the sketch problem?
[182:03.38]Oh, okay.
[182:07.02]We're good.
[182:07.36]When is the killing?
[182:08.18]There is no killing.
[182:11.66]I don't have any mods.
[182:12.52]Alright, did I do the workout?
[182:19.56]Workout using the stereo or TV.
[182:21.18]Jog and swim.
[182:21.90]Alright, let's go for a jog.
[182:32.34]Go for it.
[182:33.64]30 minutes, right?
[182:39.64]Been 30 minutes?
[182:41.32]Whoa.
[182:43.88]Whoa.
[182:45.42]Whoa.
[182:56.33]I'm going back to this weird bar.
[182:57.67]Don't I know people in here?
[183:02.40]Oh, that's right.
[183:03.70]Margarita.
[183:04.34]Hey, come visit her.
[183:14.75]Is it time for ads?
[183:15.43]Let's find out.
[183:15.85]Yeah, we're going to play ad catch up here.
[183:29.28]Let's see.
[183:31.72]Is it time for ads?
[183:34.77]Alright.
[183:34.97]We're going to run some more ads.
[183:35.79]We're going to run another three minutes.
[183:37.67]I'm playing catch up.
[183:38.59]I didn't play them before.
[183:41.61]Let's do three more minutes.
[183:44.57]Ad time.
[183:45.05]I hope you got something cool.
[183:46.85]Let's see what I get.
[183:48.45]Let's compare when we get back.
[183:49.61]Alright.
[183:52.49]Three minutes.
[183:53.61]See you in three minutes.
[183:56.23]Ad time.
[184:12.38]Somebody said, you motherfucker.
[184:19.19]You motherfucker.
[184:25.68]Dude, you got an ad for The Sims 3?
[184:27.54]No, you way.
[184:42.49]I got an onion ring?
[184:44.19]Commercial?
[184:44.79]Wow.
[184:55.00]Give us ads.
[184:55.90]Well, they're running right now.
[185:12.64]There are no ads playing?
[185:13.94]There should be.
[185:22.02]Yeah, it depends on what platform you're on.
[185:41.96]I only got another minute.
[185:50.64]I got a Fortnite ad?
[185:51.96]Oh!
[185:53.50]Is this a bit?
[185:54.34]No.
[185:59.40]I knew this stream was going to be explaining this a few times.
[186:02.32]Because I've never done anything like this before.
[186:04.87]But also...
[186:07.52]I will make it pretty clear again some of you know how much money the carnival was this is way more than that way more and Twitch is really really putting up a significant amount of money so this is they're very they're being very very helpful
[186:48.11]Alright, I think we're good.
[186:50.49]Like 15 seconds?
[187:00.36]How much money was the carnival?
[187:01.50]Well, that's, um... You can find that info if you want to somehow.
[187:06.40]I think I've talked about it once or twice, but I don't want to talk about money.
[187:08.62]I don't want to talk about that.
[187:11.51]We're playing The Sims 3.
[187:16.64]Is this the next stream?
[187:17.71]This is the stream that's happening on August 18th.
[187:21.25]So, not the next stream.
[187:23.99]But, the stream... Let me see.
[187:27.73]I'll probably... I will probably... I will be live probably two more times before you see this stream.
[187:34.50]Two or three, maybe?
[187:36.58]I got the Battleship Tournament this week.
[187:39.70]We'll be live again next week.
[187:42.59]So, we'll see.
[187:43.43]We're playing it by ear.
[187:45.67]Alright, I think we're all back.
[187:47.65]Thank you for your patience, everybody.
[187:49.11]Appreciate it.
[187:53.79]Alright.

[188:22.97]At what point would you consider calling the celebrity to come hang out and me play the piano for them?
[188:35.72]And I got to figure this out too.
[188:36.80]What is this unfinished room?
[188:41.44]They're all finished, aren't they?
[188:43.41]Oh, it's this here.
[188:44.17]Okay.
[188:44.29]Alright.
[188:44.73]I got it.
[188:45.01]I got it.
[188:45.19]I got it.
[188:49.05]It's this shit.
[188:51.00]How much money do I have?
[188:51.64]Do I have enough to do this?
[188:53.82]There.
[188:54.52]Alright.

[189:00.32]Let's play.
[189:10.76]Hard to maintain a good relationship.
[189:12.82]I'm not hanging out with her.
[189:13.55]What's with the money?
[189:14.47]What's going on?
[189:16.67]This is a boring conversation and I lost a friend.
[189:31.84]Well, can I get the friend back?
[189:42.91]What the hell?
[189:46.19]The philosophy was boring.
[189:47.53]Alright, well how about if I just start sprying or something?
[189:52.05]Alright, turn this off.
[189:54.73]It might work out.
[189:55.83]Yo, he's gonna be ready to act.
[190:01.45]That's right.
[190:13.42]I'm going Omega mode.
[190:48.74]She's like just leaving.
[190:49.92]He just won't stop.
[190:57.57]He won't stop exercising.
[190:58.99]Oh.
[191:06.40]Okay.
[191:08.46]Meet someone new.
[191:09.46]Yeah, I promise.
[191:10.60]Invite Margarita.
[191:11.24]Okay, I gotta invite Margarita over.
[191:12.52]Still playing the piano?
[191:18.84]Do you think I can invite the guy over?
[191:19.92]I think I could probably invite.
[191:24.06]Level 5 piano.
[191:25.44]I would say that's really good.
[191:28.16]Lifetime happiness panel.
[191:32.94]Lifetime rewards.
[191:34.72]Whoa, what's this?
[191:37.83]A hustler.
[191:41.43]Professional slacker.
[191:42.33]What does that do?
[191:52.72]Discount diner?
[191:57.89]All restaurant meals around the house.
[191:59.33]They're cheats.
[192:10.31]How cool would it be to be able to watch TV and slack off at work without the boss caring?
[192:13.79]Let's do that one.
[192:18.41]Still have a job, right?
[192:21.97]Earn $25 from piano tips.
[192:25.69]What?
[192:31.15]Where can I play the piano?
[192:37.95]I don't tinker.
[192:38.49]Go.
[192:44.91]Go to the bar and play the bar.
[192:46.42]Oh, shit.
[192:46.82]Alright.
[192:47.06]Alright.
[192:52.80]Use the bathroom.
[192:53.30]Go to bed.
[192:53.64]7 a.m.
[192:55.40]Whatever.
[192:55.86]I'm skipping work.
[192:56.80]Who cares?
[192:57.16]Play the bar.
[193:07.25]Piano in your backpack.
[193:15.10]Work more parties, venues, and play for tips.
[193:20.64]How do you put something in your inventory?
[193:22.00]Like this?
[193:27.38]Oh, okay.
[193:27.82]That's how you do it.
[193:33.93]What are these pictures?
[193:34.75]This is making me want to dust off my laptop and play The Sims 3.
[193:42.72]This is the best Sims, right?
[193:45.22]From everybody that's ever played any of these games.
[193:53.01]Does this one have crazy mods too?
[193:56.11]Can people run off by cars like they can in the fourth one?
[194:04.59]Pretty much.
[194:04.99]That's awesome.
[194:08.76]We'll have to play around with those.
[194:11.65]Uh, you need to go back to bed.
[194:17.83]See you later.
[194:22.34]The Sims 2 is better than The Sims 3?
[194:24.20]You know, I could probably agree with that.
[194:25.68]Maybe.
[194:26.68]Here's the problem.
[194:28.04]To get The Sims 2 to run on any new hardware, you need a PhD.
[194:35.48]I don't know why, because The Sims 1 worked.
[194:43.34]And it used to be on the EA store.
[194:48.23]I swear to God I have this memory of being able to get The Sims 2 from Origin.
[194:54.63]What happened?
[195:03.98]It was.
[195:04.24]They took it off the store.
[195:06.50]They removed it.
[195:09.60]Why?
[195:09.90]Why?
[195:13.25]It was delisted due to licensing with Ikea.
[195:17.72]Is that serious?
[195:23.02]Can't you just take the Ikea stuff out of the game?
[195:25.36]Alright, I'm going to go to the bar and I'm going to play some music.
[195:34.59]$164, good.
[195:42.05]I need to get you promoted.
[195:43.61]Go to the bookstore.
[195:48.19]What do you need to get promoted?
[195:49.05]Okay, he's a roadie.
[196:00.67]Music 2.
[196:02.42]I'm getting a new job.
[196:05.58]What's the exercise career?
[196:08.78]Yeah, I'm getting an athletic skill.
[196:11.91]Let's just quit.
[196:22.00]Find a new job.
[196:26.78]I'm looking in the athletic department.
[196:31.06]Professional sports.
[196:32.00]There we go.
[196:32.58]Better.
[196:34.95]Leave the music career.
[196:43.58]Is that a brownie?
[196:49.70]Why does everything smell?
[196:51.46]Oh, I thought he smelled.
[196:52.48]That was just the Sim thing.
[197:02.05]More lights in the house.
[197:03.96]Yeah, I think it's something to do with the game.
[197:05.50]Let me turn it up again here.
[197:13.42]That better?
[197:13.78]I don't want to blow it out too hard.
[197:25.69]That looks good.
[197:37.48]That looks more actually what it looks like on my screen.
[197:42.32]Clean, clean, clean.
[197:52.93]You're wasting money.
[197:53.65]Alright, now I need to have you quit this culinary career.
[198:04.53]They're both doing the opposite of what they should be doing.
[198:10.40]Now you get a career as a musician.
[198:11.82]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[198:21.34]Go to the bar and play the piano.
[198:27.19]I just play it anywhere?
[198:27.87]Alright, go.
[198:36.21]Can I answer that?
[198:50.84]Is your car facing the right way?
[198:51.94]It should be.
[198:55.03]Holy shit, that scared the hell out of me.
[198:56.38]I thought it was going to crash.
[198:58.64]Oh my god, this is terrifying.
[199:07.36]Okay.
[199:11.11]Now let's play the piano.
[199:13.01]Somebody was calling me the whole ride over here.
[199:16.85]Sure, let's go on a date.
[199:17.81]I know just the place.
[199:21.16]Come to, uh...

[199:26.07]You come to me.
[199:26.97]Come to me.
[199:33.64]Now, where am I going?
[199:49.69]Oh, we're going to the park.
[199:51.21]No, we're not.
[199:57.80]Um, where is she?
[200:04.04]Wait, what are you doing?
[200:05.30]Nice directions.
[200:06.14]Take cell phone photo?
[200:16.63]Why am I driving all the way back?
[200:18.11]Wait, somebody wanted to take a selfie with me?
[200:21.15]At the bar?
[200:31.49]Uh... What the fuck?
[200:41.31]I wanted to take a picture of this guy that bad?
[200:44.14]I drove all the way to meet Stacy at the subway station and decided, no, fuck, that's... That was Matthew Hammering.
[200:53.46]I gotta get a photo of that guy.
[200:55.86]I freaked out and did a U-turn.

[201:47.15]This sucks.
[202:00.39]Wait, no, they like it.
[202:01.03]I have an autograph?
[202:13.47]I cleared this whole place out.
[202:14.93]Everybody left.
[202:18.72]Wait a second.
[202:19.94]Hold on.
[202:22.56]Wait a second.
[202:30.01]Didn't I want his autograph?
[202:32.06]Oh.

[220:40.92]How are you doing?
[220:44.54]Brad is, uh... I feel like I already did that.
[220:51.94]It's time for ads?
[220:53.13]I don't think so.
[220:54.35]Not quite.
[221:03.06]Still good.
[221:03.68]Eat.
[221:05.38]Watch a little bit of TV.
[221:08.23]Oh, fuck.
[221:08.63]I need to repair it.
[221:11.27]That's gonna get you on the roof in like 30 minutes.
[221:28.28]These guys haven't spoken to each other in a week.
[221:30.02]I'm not sure they've ever spoken to each other.
[221:32.98]Maybe when I first came to the house.
[221:35.83]Before it was built.
[221:36.49]Alright, take a shower.
[221:43.39]Real quick.
[221:43.89]Come on.
[221:45.83]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[221:46.33]You want good performance.
[221:48.39]Good performance.
[221:49.35]Good performance.
[221:51.79]Alright, now you.
[221:57.29]I gotta get out of this chef career.
[221:59.08]And go do music.
[222:09.43]Sports, medical, law enforcement, sports, medical, law enforcement.
[222:12.45]Damn it.
[222:15.01]I'm not going to work.
[222:15.69]Skip it.
[222:26.76]How are you doing?
[222:29.17]You need... Have some lunch?
[222:33.23]Oopie cabarana?
[222:36.55]Have a grilled cheese.
[222:44.79]Don't go to work.
[222:45.69]Stay.
[222:53.42]Remember what?
[222:53.94]What?
[222:54.18]What?
[222:59.96]Was it a goopy?
[223:01.72]Carbonara.
[223:03.74]Carbonara?
[223:04.36]He's almost going to level up again.
[223:10.26]Nice.
[223:17.61]Keep working out.
[223:18.21]You're almost done.
[223:18.73]Double five.
[223:21.49]Gooey.
[223:22.63]Gooey.
[223:46.04]Who cares about like Dracula?
[223:47.90]I'm about to level up my point anyways, so I'll get points.
[223:59.98]There we go.
[224:10.43]Also visit the bookstore sometime to purchase a new song.
[224:16.16]Learn a new piano composition.
[224:17.46]Yeah, let's do it.
[224:19.62]Go to the bookstore.
[224:22.45]We need to pee.
[224:26.85]Go pee.
[224:30.51]Go to sleep.
[224:31.49]And then when you get up in the morning, you're going to go to the bookstore and you're going to learn some new songs.
[224:39.64]Somebody said the stream day is going to be a subathon style stream.
[224:42.78]I don't really know what that means.
[224:45.17]A subathon style stream?
[224:48.63]What's that mean?
[225:00.72]Every sub means more stream time.
[225:05.19]Oh, no.
[225:07.05]No.
[225:09.75]There's very specific rules that you will see.
[225:13.44]And the reason why I do three streams, there's a lot of reason why.
[225:19.16]So you guys, in the past, when we've done a big project or something, the carnival or geology, it's a one and done thing where you only really have two, three, four hours to even understand what's going on.
[225:35.80]So this time, because it's going to be three days, there's going to be plenty of time to understand how the game works, to kind of tutorialize yourself, to learn how to play it and everything.
[225:49.28]We'll have a solid full day or two for just tons of time, so don't worry.
[225:58.21]It is not going to be three days straight.
[226:01.35]So there will be time in between the streams.
[226:03.73]The streams will turn off.
[226:09.14]It's not a life sim.
[226:13.86]It's not a life simulator where the cameras are rolling 24-7 and you guys have to control my whole life.
[226:23.72]I mean, it's gonna be a life simulator, but not 24-7.
[226:27.92]Ever consider recycling some stream ideas?
[226:41.72]Yeah, all the time.
[226:46.53]Yeah, it's less of a Truman Show and more of an interactive experience where you guys play around with a ton of stuff.
[226:55.17]And me too.
[226:55.67]I'm going to have tons of things to play around with.
[226:57.93]So don't you worry.
[226:59.37]Special guests.
[227:01.47]Lots of stuff to do.
[227:02.27]It'll be fun.
[227:16.23]How do you even rehearse that kind of thing?
[227:21.80]Well, um...
[227:25.83]It's very new territory, so there's not much rehearsing that can be done.
[227:30.77]We're just gonna go for it.
[227:35.51]There's gonna be a shitload of time before the stream.
[227:37.65]Where we're gonna make sure everything works and is ready.
[227:50.88]It's not just going to be a, oh, well, it's August 18th.
[227:53.60]I guess we're going to see if this thing even turns on.
[227:58.30]That stuff is being worked on right now.
[228:00.21]That stuff has been being worked on since... I'm going to say June?
[228:06.77]May, I want to say, is when that started really getting hammered on.
[228:15.88]Is he going to be doing lots of acting?
[228:18.20]I bet you.
[228:23.86]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[228:30.84]Fix that.
[228:39.27]Clean that up.
[228:39.69]Am I feeding the fish?
[228:47.69]Jesus.
[228:47.95]Alright.
[228:50.33]Oh, bookstore.
[228:50.85]I'm going to go to the bookstore.
[228:54.38]First, let me pee.
[228:56.72]Have a quick lunch of bread and jam, and we're going to go.
[229:04.79]Is it going to be in like a simlish?
[229:07.97]No.
[229:08.33]Like a different language?
[229:09.07]No.
[229:13.05]Yeah, it talks.
[229:15.27]We thought about having it be sort of pantomimed, but...
[229:22.67]It probably would have got old very, very quickly.
[229:28.67]No, it's not going to be in a different language or anything.
[229:30.43]What are you guys doing?
[229:42.97]These streams are going to be boring?
[229:45.69]I highly doubt that.
[229:47.31]Alright, here's what I'll tell you about them without revealing what we're going to do.
[229:53.26]The one thing that I can guarantee, whether you love or hate these streams that are going to happen in a couple weeks, they're definitely not going to be boring.
[230:04.15]You might hate these, but you'll come away from it probably at least saying, that was kind of fucking insane what they did.
[230:12.50]Because it's not just as simple as
[230:18.29]I don't even want to tell you I don't even want to just it's not it's not what you might some of you might think it is like let's put it this way I know a lot of you probably think it's gonna be this stream where oh he's just sitting on the couch and we told him to watch TV and we told him to go pee this will be fun for three days that's not what's gonna happen
[230:42.47]Not going to tell you anything, but it's going to be a wild ride for three straight days.
[230:55.92]Have I deleted channel points yet?
[230:57.30]Why am I seeing this?
[231:07.15]And sure, I mean, I want to experiment to see what you guys do.
[231:12.47]You guys are going to have a lot more control than I think you realize.
[231:14.83]Alright, where are we going?
[231:22.65]I need... Alright, right, I entered the bookstore.
[231:26.96]Go to the... Can I... I have the thing in my inventory, right?
[231:31.54]Yeah, okay.
[231:32.68]Alright, bookstore.
[231:33.40]I'm going to go buy a new song and I'm going to play at the bookstore.
[231:38.63]Where's the bookstore?
[231:41.63]Art gallery?
[231:42.27]Is that it?
[231:45.33]What's a bookstore?
[231:52.49]Public library?
[231:57.96]Where is this place?
[232:00.12]Deep fried diner?
[232:12.15]Hmm.
[232:14.95]Butterfly.
[232:15.67]Isn't it this place?
[232:19.57]The Brightmoor, isn't that a bookstore?
[232:24.16]The red book under the candle.
[232:29.82]Business.
[232:36.17]No, science.
[232:38.05]Public school.
[232:43.51]Where the hell is this place?
[232:47.98]Hospital.
[232:52.92]Cemetery.
[232:55.58]Fuck, where is this bookstore?
[232:56.72]Can I just call and go there?
[232:58.58]Why can I not see it?
[233:01.47]Go to the- Oh, Jesus!
[233:02.73]God, it's right here!
[233:14.59]I need to buy some specific things.
[233:25.10]Alright.
[233:26.76]So I need to buy a new song.
[233:30.20]Recipes.
[233:30.76]Alright.
[233:31.32]Sheep music.
[233:35.20]Piano level five.
[233:36.46]Summer hay rides.
[233:37.60]That sounds good.
[233:40.33]Piano level six.
[233:41.95]Sure.
[233:42.31]These are expensive.
[233:43.35]Can I afford these?
[233:48.05]Don't forget the musty smell of the old books.
[233:51.75]I love books.
[233:52.55]Okay.
[233:57.79]Earn 25 from tips.
[233:59.21]He looks like he's just doing it.
[234:00.55]He's just doing it?
[234:04.18]Who's this?
[234:13.30]Addie Crew?
[234:21.93]You're playing for the pigeons.
[234:27.25]No, I'm playing for this guy.
[234:36.00]You liked that?
[234:36.52]Oh, it was nice to meet you.
[234:39.98]You want to make a band?
[234:51.67]The name of the van.
[235:10.90]Jam on any instrument to build your sim's musical skills.
[235:14.95]Once you practice enough on it, you can have a band.
[235:17.85]Start a band by talking to somebody.
[235:20.49]After forming a band, your sim will be ready to play some gigs.
[235:22.61]Be sure to answer your sim's phone or you'll miss out on those gig offers.
[235:26.29]Okay.
[235:30.20]Cool.
[235:30.44]Alright, so we gotta watch out for this phone.
[235:33.24]We're in a band together?
[235:36.73]Nice law firm.
[235:42.35]Piano and piano associates.
[235:45.85]Ads?
[235:46.07]It's time for ads?
[235:47.29]Is it an ad time?
[235:49.22]I don't think it is.
[235:51.26]Is it?
[235:52.50]Ad Andy?
[235:53.14]It might be.
[235:53.80]What the fuck was that?
[235:57.90]You wanna join our band?
[236:02.01]Oh, Matilda's going home.
[236:02.94]What about you?
[236:03.32]You want to join a band?
[236:05.62]Nice to meet you.
[236:17.36]Uh, okay.
[236:17.77]Friendly.
[236:18.13]You want to join the band?
[236:19.13]Uh, ads.
[236:23.97]Alright.
[236:24.31]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[236:27.65]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[236:30.33]On the top of the hour, every hour.
[236:33.44]At least for today.
[236:35.15]The next stream that I do is not going to have ads ran on it.
[236:39.71]I want to make that clear as well.
[236:44.57]Okay.
[236:48.21]Let's see.
[236:48.63]What can we do?
[236:49.31]Alright, we're going to do another three minutes.
[236:53.01]Three minute break here.
[236:56.10]Thank you for your patience too, everybody.
[236:58.66]So, I'll be back in three.
[237:04.55]Then I think we're only going to need to do this like one more time at the end of the stream.
[237:12.57]Why is this happening?
[237:13.39]Somebody asked.
[237:14.41]They probably just came in.
[237:15.34]So the reason why this is happening is Twitch has ponied up a significant amount of money to make sure that the Dollhouse stream happens.
[237:28.22]I would dare say that if we did not have the financial backing from Twitch, we would probably not be able to do this.
[237:35.42]It would be very, very hard for me to do it on my own.
[237:38.65]So as part of that agreement, some of these streams here that you're going to watch are going to have ad breaks.
[237:46.73]That's it.
[237:50.23]Here we go.
[237:51.75]Three minutes.
[237:52.47]I'll see you in three minutes.
[238:06.82]Oh, yeah, some of you are still here.
[238:10.59]Capitalist Andy.
[238:13.33]Well, wouldn't Capitalist Andy imply that, like, I'm going to make a bunch of money from this endeavor?
[238:21.11]No, it's all going to the production.
[238:23.03]All of it.
[238:23.91]Every single cent.
[238:26.07]And then some.
[238:28.77]And then some.
[238:32.06]It's an investment.
[238:33.72]I mean, you could look at it like that, maybe, sure.
[238:40.17]We have to pay for the Jerma DLC somehow.
[238:55.70]Stop pretending?
[238:58.20]No, this is the real deal.
[239:00.64]If I was going to run ads, I would want you to be completely transparent on this.
[239:13.06]Ads, ads, ads, ads, ads.
[239:14.95]He's pretending to care.
[239:16.21]No, I don't have to say anything.
[239:24.01]I don't have to say anything.
[239:26.63]I'm a doctor too.
[239:29.15]Do subs get ads?
[239:29.97]I actually don't know.
[239:30.53]Did they change that recently?
[239:32.53]Do subs get ads?
[239:34.89]I thought they did.
[239:36.20]Maybe they don't.
[239:43.09]Ignore the rude comments.
[239:44.45]I actually don't see very many.
[239:49.63]It's a scary thing to do something you've never done before.
[239:55.38]I was thinking about this for a long time.
[239:58.34]I'm going to be running ads.
[239:59.88]We're bringing on a few partners, essentially, for this project.
[240:04.98]I just hope you understand that everything that is done is done to try to make the best possible stream I can possibly do.
[240:12.09]So, I don't, I think people would, no, I'm not seeing anybody saying anything.
[240:15.83]People, you guys have been very, very supportive.
[240:19.08]Which is crazy.
[240:19.94]Is there a date?
[240:29.66]Yes, August 18th at 3 p.m.
[240:30.60]Eastern.
[240:31.02]August 20th at 3 p.m.
[240:32.22]Eastern and August 21st at 12 p.m.
[240:34.72]Eastern.
[240:49.84]Those are the three dates and the three times that the stream will be live.
[240:57.91]Why is the third stream at a different time?
[240:59.47]That's a good question.
[241:01.21]The reason why the third stream is at a different time is so we potentially have more time for the day.
[241:11.25]We want to make sure we have a lot of time.
[241:13.63]So starting earlier means we can go longer.
[241:19.28]Especially on that third day, which would be the last day of the event, I guess you could call it.
[241:22.88]I'm a bad listener.
[241:29.72]What days?
[241:30.31]August 18th, August 20th, and the 21st of August of 2021, which means in about two weeks.
[241:37.13]Two weeks from now.
[241:39.45]tweet about the dates, you're probably going to see a very, very heavy amount of promotion here over the next week or two from more than one source.
[241:49.17]So you will know as long as you pay a little bit of attention.
[241:57.42]Are you going to last three days?
[241:59.58]I hope so.
[242:00.28]I've never done anything like that before, but that was another part of the point to put the day in between.
[242:06.82]So do the 18th and then, alright, how am I doing?
[242:11.42]Give me a day.
[242:12.69]Give everybody a day.
[242:14.43]Then we come back again.
[242:18.39]You're not streaming on my birthday?
[242:20.61]I'm sorry.
[242:24.13]Anybody collaborating with you on this?
[242:26.57]Yes.
[242:29.41]There'll be some special guests.
[242:32.37]We will tell you who those people are very, very soon, I think.
[242:40.86]I think some of you guys are going to be... I think a lot of you guys are going to be really excited.
[242:47.86]There are multiple special guests, by the way.
[242:53.58]And I'm very much looking forward to it.
[242:55.62]I can't wait.
[243:00.22]Let's continue with the rest of this.
[243:03.67]I'll probably be live for another hour or so.
[243:07.01]There's still a lot of work to be done on this project.
[243:15.51]I just was able to announce it today.
[243:19.31]Is it going to be a star-studded event?
[243:25.98]Yeah, I would say so.
[243:33.61]Alright, what was I here?
[243:36.93]Okay, here we go.
[243:38.61]I need to play.
[243:39.37]I need to make money from... Alright, get the piano out here.
[243:44.25]Take it out.
[243:48.80]Learn these new songs.
[243:54.92]No, no, no.
[243:55.20]Learn the songs.
[243:55.86]Learn these songs.
[243:56.60]Learn.
[243:59.14]Oh, I have to actually play it.
[244:04.21]Learn.
[244:09.57]Alright, there we go.
[244:10.81]Plus 350.
[244:10.99]Learn this one, too.
[244:17.23]Oh, shit.
[244:17.45]They love it.
[244:18.97]They love it.
[244:19.91]Hey!
[244:20.88]Wait, no.
[244:21.66]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[244:22.76]No, excuse me.
[244:24.68]Excuse me.
[244:25.48]Only this is where I go.
[244:27.14]I'm getting out of here.
[244:29.28]They're not even listening to me.
[244:32.58]Well, now they will be.
[244:40.84]No, come listen to my music.
[244:42.30]Hey, why don't we combine forces here?
[244:53.67]You know this one?
[244:54.81]This is the part of the movie where the main character has sunglasses on and he holds the piano and he goes...
[245:02.95]Who's calling me?
[245:10.62]Oh!
[245:10.82]Gig!
[245:11.06]It's gonna be a gig!
[245:12.56]It's gonna be a gig!
[245:13.06]Answer the phone!
[245:15.54]Answer the phone!
[245:18.40]It's gonna be a gig!
[245:19.02]There's a rock concert at the theater tonight featuring the Screaming Llamas.
[245:26.05]It might be in the best of interest of Piano and Piano to attend so they can learn from the best in the biz.
[245:31.03]Yes.
[245:32.84]Where is it?
[245:33.16]Okay, there it is.
[245:36.46]Rockstar Study at the Movie Cineplex.
[245:40.16]That sounds good to me.
[245:40.80]Alright.
[245:47.22]Visit Movie Cineplex to complete the opportunity.
[245:49.72]Alright, let's go.
[245:50.95]How am I doing?
[245:51.79]Oh, shit.
[245:52.33]I'm tired.
[245:52.71]I'm tired and hungry.
[245:56.41]Nap.
[245:57.01]Take a nap.
[246:04.49]I'm back between 5 p.m.

[246:17.66]Well, that's like tomorrow.

[246:43.93]That answer your question?
[247:12.26]It's the only song he knows.
[247:13.49]Yes, it is.
[247:15.71]But wait, no, hold on.
[247:16.53]What about the, uh, the... I'm a creep.
[247:20.13]I know that one too.
[247:39.63]I used to jump around on...
[247:42.62]Okay, I remember being in the backyard when I was younger.
[247:45.84]And just jumping around with a big stereo.
[247:50.98]Listening to that song by Radiohead.
[247:53.12]What's the name of that song?
[247:54.68]What is it called?
[247:57.36]It was on repeat.
[247:58.44]I had that album when I was younger.
[248:04.04]No, not Creep.
[248:04.72]No, no, no.
[248:05.04]The other one.
[248:05.36]It's called Paranoid... What is it called?
[248:09.00]Paranoid Android.
[248:09.82]That's the one.
[248:13.71]I played Paranoid Android on repeat.
[248:15.97]Just jumping around in the backyard.
[248:27.20]That song was like... It reminded me of Bohemian Rhapsody.
[248:30.86]It's like four songs in one.
[248:32.60]I love that.
[248:33.04]I remember loving that song.
[248:44.41]That song slaps.
[248:45.21]Yeah, it does.
[248:45.71]Alright, what time is it?
[248:52.23]Alright, 5.30.
[248:52.76]We gotta rest up.
[248:54.02]We gotta get ready to play the gig.
[249:02.60]It slaps means it's really cool.
[249:05.20]I know what that means.
[249:07.80]I'm 35, not 80.
[249:24.30]Computer, show me Celery Man.
[249:27.62]That's a classic.
[249:29.98]Of course it is.
[249:37.54]I eat.
[249:38.08]I got like a few hours.
[249:43.65]Clean up first.
[249:44.37]This is disgusting.
[249:50.34]I'm going to have breakfast.
[249:51.36]I'm going to have... Why can't I... I only know how to make pancakes.
[249:53.86]No, you broke the toilet and then left.
[250:05.65]Whatever.
[250:06.35]Do I have to eat again?
[250:09.31]No.
[250:09.55]Alright.

[250:13.85]Prepare pancakes.
[250:14.59]I already did.
[250:15.07]I just did it.
[250:15.69]Okay.

[250:31.57]I think the game crashed.
[250:34.97]Fuck the game cra- No, it didn't.
[250:36.67]I'm good.

[251:21.35]My favorite band is the Gorillaz.
[251:23.97]Though I have not kept up very much with any of the newer stuff they've done over the last, I want to say like a year?
[251:29.73]A bit more than a year?
[251:39.55]Honestly, the last time I really kept up with the Gorillaz was when Humans came out.
[251:45.25]That's pretty much it.
[251:46.37]And why does my mic look like it's fucking low?
[251:48.21]Hold on a second.
[251:53.85]What's going on here?
[251:54.37]This looks low.
[251:57.67]Is this low to anybody else?
[251:59.65]Am I better?
[252:00.43]Does that sound better?
[252:04.34]That looked really low.
[252:05.64]Are we good now?
[252:06.92]Why did that turn off?
[252:09.32]Alright, that definitely looks like you can hear me better.

[271:38.20]He lost the ghost?
[271:39.12]I think I can probably call him.
[271:41.86]I made... I got friendly with him.
[271:42.94]I should really call him.
[271:53.35]Uh, what?
[272:00.41]Brad Elberson got trapped in the elevator doors.
[272:04.53]Um...
[272:08.65]Is he okay?
[272:09.27]He will always remember the feeling the door slam on his body as he was trying to get out.
[272:18.19]Where the fuck am I?
[272:27.79]Greasy?
[272:30.09]Whose house am I in?
[272:40.81]This is freaking me out.
[272:41.63]Is this a gym?
[273:02.89]I'm so confused.
[273:03.77]Just go home.
[273:14.42]Can I call the ghost?
[273:19.04]To invite over.
[273:20.02]I want to see if I can call the ghost.
[273:22.30]Ghost.
[273:22.66]Did you hear that?
[273:23.16]That was like ghost.
[273:33.63]Should I call the fire department?
[273:35.87]Okay.

[273:41.55]They send Stacey.
[273:42.73]I go on one knee and I propose.
[273:44.91]I say the fire is in my heart and it's been there for the last six days since you and I met.
[274:07.41]What if it's not Stacey?
[274:12.71]One star celebrity bullshit.
[274:15.53]Clean yourself.
[274:20.40]I want to invite... Very tender love?
[274:30.47]What was the ghost's name?
[274:32.89]Does the ghost have a name?
[274:39.73]Remember, that's a felony.
[274:42.55]Yeah, and then I get fucking thrown... I get arrested and thrown in jail.
[274:51.60]Stacy, just come over.
[274:52.34]Let's hang out.

[275:20.41]What's wrong with her?
[275:20.99]We both have the... I just got a knocked out thing.
[275:30.58]I'm seeing stars.
[275:31.14]Why?
[275:43.89]Fucking idiot.
[275:45.95]Don't go to work.
[275:48.29]This guy runs out on everyone, every time.
[275:52.90]No, don't leave.
[275:56.02]Don't leave.
[275:56.86]I'm not ready for you to leave.
[276:00.70]Look, we're gonna... I think I'm in love with a ghost.
[276:05.77]Is this my weird way to break up with her?

[276:18.63]No.
[276:19.79]No!

[276:25.24]Hold hands.

[278:24.16]It has to be a private wedding.

[282:32.66]Wait, Stacy has a job, right?
[282:33.90]What do you mean?
[282:36.36]Unemployed.
[282:37.86]What?
[282:38.27]Unemployed.
[282:38.81]How?
[282:40.63]I thought you were a firefighter.
[282:41.61]You're not a firefighter anymore?
[282:44.35]Why are you not a firefighter?
[282:48.67]Why does she know the piano?
[282:50.27]She just level two piano?
[283:00.33]She gave it all up.
[283:01.31]Oh, shit.
[283:02.59]Who's that?
[283:15.36]Pick that phone up.
[283:22.83]Push it.
[283:23.95]Work out using the push self option for three hours.
[283:38.75]That's so long to be working out.
[283:40.59]Three hours?
[283:44.21]I haven't been paying that much attention to Rad.
[283:47.15]But... Oh my god.
[283:50.82]Almost level 8 athletic.
[283:52.06]I haven't even been paying attention.
[284:00.20]Play ads.
[284:00.99]Is it time for ads?
[284:06.19]Alright, while they sleep.
[284:06.81]It's time for ads.
[284:07.29]It's time for ads.
[284:10.95]We're going to do this now, and then we're going to do one more time at the end of the stream.
[284:15.51]So if you don't, you can, you know.
[284:16.95]This will be the last time before the stream is over, though.
[284:25.88]Let me run them.
[284:27.16]I'll see you guys in two seconds.
[284:28.72]Those of you that are still here, we'll be here.
[284:33.80]Save this, though.
[284:34.84]Make sure it doesn't cause a problem.
[284:43.35]It's the first time I've seen chat cheer for ads.
[284:47.66]Oh, they used to, too.
[284:48.96]But back in the day, they did.
[284:51.00]We used to run ads for fun.
[284:52.48]Just as a joke.
[284:55.24]Alright, I'll see you guys in three minutes.
[284:58.14]And then we'll do this one more time at the end of the stream.
[285:01.06]See you in a minute.
[285:02.02]Three minutes, to be exact.
[285:18.28]End of the stream ads.
[285:21.44]Yeah, I'm going to see how many I've never done this before.
[285:24.57]I wonder how many I can actually run.
[285:32.72]Do five minutes.
[285:33.74]I don't think I can do more than a few minutes every hour or so.
[285:37.74]Whatever it is, whatever.
[285:38.50]I don't know the exact timing.
[285:50.47]You can do three minutes every five minutes.
[285:54.57]Well, that's the quickest way to destroy your entire career and make it so not any human being will ever watch your channel ever for any reason.
[286:03.82]60% ads.
[286:20.29]Three minutes every five minutes.
[286:21.71]That's insane.
[286:29.07]I would say a couple minutes of advertising is doesn't necessarily bother me as long as it's not like, as long as I'm in control of it.
[286:41.40]Right.
[286:43.50]If I can tell you, Hey guys, here comes an ad and it's like once like an hour or something.
[286:49.47]Like 30, 40, 50 minutes or so.
[286:51.01]The one thing that I hate more than anything is just ads that just jump out at you.
[286:59.83]On a live platform like this, it's so awful to just... Oh, here we... We're in the middle of doing something.
[287:07.94]Oh, you're gone.
[287:08.62]And my screen got 50% louder.
[287:12.02]And I have no idea what I'm looking at anymore.
[287:18.89]So, if I run ads, it'll be in scenarios like this.
[287:23.83]Where you know they're coming.
[287:25.21]You know they're coming for at least a full minute or so.
[287:28.04]And I'm still, I'm not gonna keep going.
[287:34.00]So, there'll be ads on the streams that we do.
[287:37.88]And there's gonna be a few people whose sole job it is to make sure that they're in a place that's not gonna cause any problems, like, content-wise.
[287:46.04]That's a huge deal for me.
[287:47.44]I don't want people to miss anything.
[287:49.44]So we're going to find the right times to do those.
[287:54.16]There's no way that I'm going to want somebody to be in like two minutes of ads and something crazy is happening on the screen.
[288:01.82]No.
[288:08.50]And you should be back.
[288:09.74]Hello.
[288:10.16]Welcome back.
[288:12.26]That is the final time we're going to do that.
[288:15.08]I'm going to do it one more time at the very end of the stream before turning it off.
[288:22.17]Which I'll probably go for like another maybe like 20, 30 minutes or so.
[288:25.61]I do want to see, I want to conclude this arc here.
[288:32.88]Why did you start running ads in the first place?
[288:34.48]Well, I'd like to tell you.
[288:37.06]There's going to be three streams.
[288:41.12]The Dollhouse stream, where you will be able to control me as a viewer.
[288:46.03]We're doing the Dollhouse thing that I talked about a couple years ago.
[288:49.51]Twitch has put forward a significant amount of money to partner with us to make this stream possible.
[288:59.74]And ads need to be ran on these streams.
[289:04.28]as part of our agreement.
[289:06.40]There you are.
[289:10.73]I know people are going to go, hey, he keeps saying it, he keeps saying it.
[289:13.09]I've got to make it really clear, especially new people coming and going, trickling in and out.
[289:16.75]It's a lot of info to have.
[289:18.07]It's a huge amount of new information.
[289:20.37]And you will get more as the weeks go by.
[289:22.39]The next week or two, you're going to get a ton more info.
[289:25.21]I'm very excited.
[289:26.41]Let's finish this up, though.
[289:34.57]Okay.
[289:35.77]So, uh... I want to play a gig.
[289:50.76]Include the bugle arc today.
[289:54.37]The next time, if I stream the... If we do The Sims again, let's say we do this next week, I think we're going to just do insane mods.
[290:03.29]It might be a mod shitshow stream next week for Sims 3.
[290:11.78]And then in a couple of days is the finale of the Battleship Tournament with Ludwig.
[290:17.48]Same deal.
[290:17.98]Going to be over on his channel.
[290:20.88]We'll finish that up too this week.
[290:24.23]Why is this not going fast?
[290:25.07]Hurry up.
[290:34.64]Give Rad his cemetery goth girlfriend already.
[290:37.32]I just like burped really loud.
[290:44.06]I hope the mic didn't pick it up.
[290:51.05]Grab a bowl of soup.
[290:53.17]Oh, that's just mac and cheese.
[290:54.65]I kind of want mac and cheese right now.
[290:56.21]Why is there moss growing here?
[291:05.91]Alright, everybody get up.
[291:07.59]The whole household.
[291:08.23]Everybody.
[291:09.20]Mac and cheese sounds so good.
[291:19.98]I just like, I want something.
[291:22.88]I'm hungry.
[291:23.30]What do I want?
[291:26.20]If you were me, what would you eat right now?
[291:37.10]He's still playing Vanilla Sims.
[291:38.88]Not as of next time.
[291:42.80]Yeah, let's talk.
[291:45.62]Everything's just exploding.
[291:47.38]Can we fix this, please?
[291:57.27]Yeah, I will be hosting Ludwig's stream like we did last time.
[292:04.64]Anything else need to be fixed?
[292:05.62]Clean this up.
[292:11.60]Invite to cuddle.
[292:12.49]Alright, should we try to make a baby?
[292:30.04]Out on bed.
[292:30.56]Cuddle on bed.
[292:48.15]I thought that was the baby.
[292:48.85]I was like, why is the baby in this?
[292:51.51]What is going on?
[292:52.35]Who is this?
[292:54.47]Jason Bard?
[292:57.92]Who is this guy?
[292:58.70]What is he doing?
[293:00.90]He's taking the sink?
[293:05.36]Who is this alien?
[293:09.97]What is he doing?
[293:13.23]He took the wallpaper?
[293:15.09]What did he take?
[293:18.70]He took the wallpaper.
[293:23.48]It's the repo, man.
[293:24.69]No, not my bugs.
[293:26.01]Not my bugs.
[293:26.57]Anything but my bugs.
[293:27.99]No, you can't have my bugs.
[293:34.17]Oh, my God.
[293:34.65]He took the bugs.
[293:35.19]No, he didn't.
[293:36.21]What did he take?
[293:36.65]Are you pregnant?
[293:42.38]What's wrong?
[293:46.68]It was time for a change.
[293:47.62]He removed houses.
[293:50.34]Looks like your household bills have gone unpaid.
[293:52.74]Oh.
[293:55.80]Stacy just grasped the basics.
[293:58.10]She got the wrench out.
[294:00.78]Duh, they woohooed.
[294:04.07]Stacy Elbertson just woohooed with a celebrity.
[294:07.73]Bernard Elbertson.
[294:09.41]A famous frolic who is certainly a memory that won't be forgotten.
[294:13.35]Bernard Elbertson just enjoyed a woohoo with Stacy Elbertson in bed.
[294:17.30]A romantic rendezvous with a special celebrity?
[294:31.99]I want that.
[294:32.93]I want to make a baby.
[294:33.77]Try again.
[294:42.36]Okay.
[294:55.59]Yeah?
[295:07.28]That is so annoying.
[295:09.20]This is annoying.
[295:10.06]It's pregnant?
[295:29.12]Not pregnant.
[295:33.95]She's already pregnant?
[295:36.57]You're pregnant the first time.
[295:40.87]What?
[295:41.65]No, she's not.
[296:01.73]Jingle already played.
[296:02.61]She's pregnant.
[296:09.80]It's dark in... Oh, they took the lamp.
[296:25.85]It's dark in here.
[296:31.43]Okay, what do I want to put up on here?
[296:33.81]Just take... I don't care.
[296:34.79]Whatever.
[296:35.11]It doesn't matter.
[296:35.75]It'll be ugly as hell.
[296:37.29]It doesn't matter.
[296:38.05]That was 200 bucks, but who cares?
[296:39.73]Alright, we're friends.
[296:42.53]Look.
[296:42.97]Brad Elverson just became friends with a celebrity.
[297:02.16]What an egomaniac thing.
[297:05.16]Word around town is that Frenard had something repossessed.
[297:08.80]Yeah, a sconce on the wall.
[297:10.49]Who cares?
[297:11.07]They don't like each other.
[297:15.57]Why do they not like each other?
[297:16.39]That's weird.
[297:22.65]But, um, let's dispel those rumors right now.
[297:29.02]She lives in the house.
[297:32.15]I can't believe those rumors could get so vicious, Bernard.
[297:34.15]You are alright in my book.
[297:39.01]Let's throw a party.
[297:55.40]Throw party.
[298:04.49]Let's invite everybody.
[298:11.33]Dress code, formal attire.
[298:14.45]Everyone's invited.
[298:15.13]I'm going to play the piano for everybody.
[298:26.46]Maximum guests, okay.
[298:30.80]Party will start at 9 p.m.
[298:35.97]We have so much in common.
[298:36.81]I'd love to get to know you better.
[298:37.83]Are you talking to her?
[298:40.05]Alright, we need to make food.
[298:45.57]A lot of it.
[298:48.09]Serve mac and cheese.
[298:49.13]We need to have like a bunch of mac and cheese out.
[298:50.49]Make sure everyone's having a good time.
[298:53.81]Alright, make mac and cheese and then I'm going to skip my piano.
[298:56.33]Let's go.
[298:58.31]Perform.
[299:06.46]I think I'm in love with a ghost!
[299:09.36]Does this just bring food?
[299:16.73]That looks way better than what we have.
[299:18.51]We have mac and cheese and that's it.
[299:19.87]This guy has like spaghetti and meatballs.
[299:29.96]Eat that up.
[299:37.73]Don't let anybody else have that.
[299:38.67]Put that in the fridge.
[299:42.35]What did that guy bring?
[299:43.15]What do you got?
[299:45.87]Nachos?
[299:46.69]Put it in the fridge.
[299:47.63]This is the best way to just get free food.
[299:51.80]Burnt mac and cheese is what we're serving.
[299:54.04]Put that away.
[299:54.84]They're booing me.
[299:59.75]They're just choking.
[300:17.02]What is this guy?
[300:24.93]Everybody's thinking of this guy.
[300:27.51]Where is he?
[300:29.74]Is it this guy?
[300:30.48]Why is everybody freaking out about that guy?
[300:32.98]I don't understand.
[300:40.73]That's my gig.
[300:44.35]Store that.
[300:44.81]Give me the nachos.
[300:45.45]Put them away.
[300:45.79]Put the nachos away.
[300:49.50]This sounds like a mobile game ad.
[301:07.31]It does sound like a mobile game ad.
[301:14.83]What is going on with the mobile game shit?
[301:17.39]Somebody please explain this to me.
[301:18.95]What's wrong with this world?
[301:21.74]Every mobile game ad has the weird pull the gold bar for the fire and the water to go down different ways.
[301:29.98]Why do all of them do that?
[301:32.08]All of them.
[301:33.12]It's like, think you can do better?
[301:36.43]That's not even in the game.
[301:38.05]That's not what the games are.
[301:39.83]Why do they do that?
[301:40.93]It's crazy to me.
[301:42.33]I don't get it.
[301:46.74]It's marketing to children, but how?
[301:48.78]That's not even in the fucking game.
[301:50.58]It's also level one grunt.
[301:57.19]It's social manipulation.
[302:00.21]But like, but why the gold sliders, right?
[302:04.31]Why?
[302:05.85]Can you save the day?
[302:06.77]Ah!
[302:07.43]Ah!
[302:09.09]Slide, slide.
[302:10.29]Ah!
[302:11.11]Oh, the fire went down.
[302:13.01]And killed them.
[302:13.99]I don't get it.
[302:15.61]I'm trying so desperately to figure out what that means.
[302:26.55]It's an easy puzzle that's meant to anger you at how dumb people are so you'll get it.
[302:32.61]But I kind of want to play that game.
[302:35.32]You know what I mean?
[302:35.80]I'm like irritated.
[302:36.78]I would like to play that game.
[302:44.22]It worked.
[302:45.04]I want to play that game.
[302:46.47]I want to play that one.
[302:48.09]I don't want to play the other stupid thing that they have.
[302:56.87]Mobile game.
[303:03.04]Have you ever seen that video where it's like a gorilla?
[303:06.66]It's one of those ads.
[303:09.10]And the person, they pull one of the things and the gorilla comes and punches this lady in the face.
[303:14.18]And it goes like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[303:15.86]Your IQ is like 40.
[303:19.63]It's so funny.
[303:23.11]Hold on.
[303:26.33]It's so funny.
[303:27.19]I need to show it.
[303:36.15]Let me see.
[303:36.63]I have it like saved somewhere.
[303:43.38]Let me see if I can show it.
[303:46.36]He dreamt it?
[303:46.98]No, no.
[303:47.40]This is a real thing.
[303:56.39]I did not dream this.
[303:57.27]Fuck, where is it?
[304:05.64]Time for an ad break?
[304:06.56]No, no, no, no.
[304:08.00]We're not doing that until the end.
[304:10.78]One with the... I think... Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[304:12.40]I got it.
[304:13.46]Okay, I can show it.
[304:16.83]Yeah, alright.
[304:17.29]This is it.
[304:17.71]I got it.
[304:17.97]I knew I had it saved.
[304:20.73]This ad is crazy.
[304:31.03]Hopefully it's not really loud.
[304:35.42]Let me make sure it's not, like, insanely loud.
[304:42.20]Would be a... I have to take just a video.
[304:51.85]Alright, here we go.
[304:53.71]Here comes, like, the most ridiculous mobile ad.
[304:57.03]Hope it's not too loud.
[305:02.40]It was fucking loud, ow!
[305:06.10]Ow, fuck!
[305:07.66]I tried to grab it as fast as I could.
[305:10.07]Oh my god, why?
[305:12.79]Ow.
[305:17.52]Stupid fucking thing.
[305:42.98]I am so sorry, guys.
[305:44.72]I knew it was- I tried to give warning to myself and to you.
[305:48.44]I just- I couldn't change it.
[305:49.58]There's nothing I could do about it.
[305:51.19]I hope that was not horrible.
[305:52.43]It probably was fucking horrible.
[305:55.01]I'm so sorry.
[305:57.05]One more.
[305:57.35]Your IQ is 39.
[306:13.71]Oh, I wish there was a compilation of mobile game ads.
[306:16.40]I would watch it.
[306:18.24]They actually might be.
[306:19.48]I'm going to look into that.
[306:22.08]Alright, let's finish this arc up.
[306:24.30]And then I will see you guys on, I believe, Thursday?
[306:28.20]Let me just see what the plan is.
[306:37.03]Yes.
[306:38.07]So I believe the plan is going to be Thursday around 2 Pacific PM.
[306:44.17]That's when we're going to do the conclusion of the battleship things.
[306:46.01]What happened?
[306:53.54]You alright?
[306:59.36]Is she pregnant?
[307:02.32]When's the dollhouse stream?
[307:03.36]August 18th, 20th, and 21st.
[307:05.88]It's three streams.
[307:06.98]It is a major event.
[307:08.18]It's going to be a long time.
[307:09.34]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[307:12.26]She is pregnant.
[307:13.41]Oh.
[307:24.41]How do I skip time to the 18th of August?
[307:27.11]Keep yourself busy.
[307:32.03]Have each day have something else that you need to try to do.
[307:35.57]It's almost Rad's birthday in a few days.
[307:37.90]Why not buy him a birthday cake?
[307:45.50]Oh, she, yeah, she is.
[307:52.51]We gotta see the baby.
[307:56.27]Yeah, keep yourself, um, keep yourself occupied.
[307:59.91]Make sure you're, uh, keeping your brain going.
[308:05.92]Guys, man, you can stagnate.
[308:09.70]I did.
[308:14.08]Stay active.
[308:15.19]And that does not mean necessarily physical.
[308:22.45]What is she doing?
[308:27.21]Dancing?
[308:37.49]How long does it take for The Sims 3 for a baby to show up?
[308:39.17]I thought that was the repo guy again.
[308:45.51]You want some tips on pregnancy?
[308:47.15]Sure.
[308:47.41]Pregnant Sims will get a few days of paid rest from work before and after the baby's born.
[308:52.59]Keep an eye on your Sims' new wishes now that she's pregnant.
[308:57.20]It's a few days, okay.
[308:59.16]Discomfort, and here comes the baby.
[309:01.96]Alright, that's fine.
[309:09.82]A few days?
[309:10.26]Alright.
[309:10.48]See you later, rat.
[309:20.40]The fridge stinks.
[309:21.18]Clean that.
[309:25.19]Clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean.
[309:32.77]Why is he ripped?
[309:33.45]Because he's an athletic person.
[309:35.95]Athletic career.
[309:40.50]300 jumping jacks a day.
[309:50.09]I want to see the baby before we go.
[309:57.89]It's very important to me.
[310:02.01]Oh, nope.
[310:03.73]Aww.
[310:06.00]Finish reading?
[310:06.78]No.
[310:07.00]Hmm.
[310:11.36]It's EST.
[310:11.94]It is East.
[310:12.62]Yes.
[310:13.20]We're going by Eastern time.
[310:14.51]Figure it out easier that way.
[310:21.33]So it would be 12 Pacific for the first two streams and then 9 AM Pacific on the last one.
[310:29.23]Alright.
[310:33.72]Bring that baby in.
[310:34.54]I just want to see the baby.
[310:45.72]Baby, baby, baby, baby.
[310:47.08]Let's see the baby.
[310:47.74]Let's see the baby.
[310:48.36]I want the baby.
[310:48.90]I'm visiting Boston soon and I want to know what your favorite restaurant is.
[310:58.03]Papa Gino's.
[311:14.42]God damn it, now I want pizza.
[311:16.34]But I want good pizza.
[311:17.42]I want Papagino's pizza.
[311:20.56]I want Papagino's pizza, and I can't get it.
[311:23.42]God damn it.
[311:24.92]That sucks.
[311:38.76]Door dash it?
[311:39.53]That would be quite the delivery fee.
[311:42.69]That would probably cost like $4,000.
[311:47.03]Considering they need to drive it across the entire country.
[311:49.95]I had pizza today.
[312:00.16]Are you jealous?
[312:00.78]Yeah, I actually kind of am.
[312:01.66]Dude, relax.

[312:43.47]How come I can't, um, massage?
[312:45.50]Where's the baby?
[313:11.18]I'm just speedrunning to the baby.
[313:12.40]I'm actually going... Who's that?
[313:25.60]Oh, okay.
[313:25.96]It was her.
[313:26.94]I thought she was in here.
[313:27.62]Is somebody's carpool?
[313:33.63]It was not in there.
[313:34.31]Oh.
[313:38.31]We just stay here the whole day.
[313:43.12]Big lemon.
[313:43.80]No.
[313:47.42]Does she work?
[313:53.26]Why is she being picked up?
[313:57.96]I'm confused.
[313:58.60]Who's picking her up?
[314:06.15]This is a pregnancy speed run.
[314:16.58]It's her husband's wife's boyfriend.
[314:23.16]Okay.
[314:24.25]Hey, I think Rad got promoted.
[314:25.69]Yep.
[314:28.91]Minor leaks are calling, so pack your socks.
[314:31.67]Romeo Rake wants to know if Stacey Elbertson would like to go on a date.
[314:35.13]Ooh.
[314:49.11]Alright.
[314:50.23]Stand him up.
[314:50.67]Stop getting in the fucking car!
[314:58.97]Get out!
[314:59.41]What are you doing?
[315:16.41]I did that because that guy... You know, you're calling a married woman.
[315:20.34]You know that, right?
[315:21.78]Very happily married woman.
[315:24.40]You know that I'm pregnant with my husband's child.
[315:28.62]Our child.
[315:31.30]Why are you... You want to go on a date?
[315:35.42]What are you doing?
[315:43.29]I heard him breathe weird.
[315:44.91]Like he was choking in there.
[315:52.57]Alright, let's see that baby.
[316:09.19]Ugly bastard, why?
[316:10.30]I want to clip Jerma saying that he's pregnant and post it to Reddit and that's the big announcement.
[316:30.25]God.
[316:35.65]Okay, is it time for the baby?
[316:37.35]5 a.m., 6 a.m.
[316:50.92]And... The baby is... How does she smell?
[317:03.59]Oh, I thought it was like, Rad's the name of the baby?
[317:06.25]Like, that would be very odd.
[317:15.08]Yay, Rad was born!
[317:16.56]It's Rad's birthday!
[317:17.84]Oh, she just turned the TV off on him.
[317:30.21]The baby's coming!
[317:30.87]The baby's coming!
[317:35.69]Oh shit, they're gonna have the same birthday!
[317:37.11]Take her to the hospital!
[317:44.03]Take her to the hospital, go to the hospital!
[317:45.22]Did she go to the hospital by herself?
[317:50.96]No, no, I wanna go too, I wanna go too.
[317:52.58]No, no, no, me too, me too, me too.
[317:53.96]Me, I wanna go, I wanna go!
[317:55.06]But what about me?
[317:57.12]Oh shit, I'm gonna miss my birth of my child.
[318:06.40]Oh my god, what a wild birthday party.
[318:10.24]They'll be telling this story for the next 50 years.
[318:21.17]I know, it was my birth, we were gonna go to, we were gonna go to Arby's and shit, and then all of a sudden your water broke?
[318:40.14]What?
[318:40.30]Why is she pissed?
[318:43.40]Who's this?
[318:46.12]The guitar?
[318:49.27]Oh, she went to the jam session.
[318:50.89]Come on, come on.
[318:51.49]I got to get there quick.
[318:52.97]I got to get the pants here quick.
[318:56.16]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[318:56.96]I got to play with my son.
[319:03.82]My daughter!
[319:04.38]I don't even know what the- I don't even know what the- I don't even know!
[319:08.55]It's a baby boy!
[319:09.47]It's a baby boy!
[319:11.37]A happy mother and a smooth pregnancy makes for a happy baby.
[319:18.63]Since Stacy's pregnancy went so well, you'll be able to choose two traits.
[319:24.05]What would you like to name him?
[319:28.62]Brad.
[319:31.44]No, how about I'm a musician?
[319:37.68]I'm a musician.
[319:43.78]Cello Elbertson.
[319:59.97]Evil and insane.
[320:00.99]Alright, I gotta get the band here.
[320:07.52]There's the baby!
[320:08.08]Alright.
[320:08.72]Where are you going?
[320:13.88]Running away from the baby.
[320:20.47]I want to invite the band members.
[320:22.31]We have to play like a celebration.
[320:31.10]Oh shit, we're all leaving.
[320:50.03]Where's my... Join the jam session.
[321:06.35]Oh, whatever.
[321:06.77]Go home.
[321:08.11]How's Cello Elbertson doing?
[321:27.57]I need a crib.
[321:29.51]I need a crib.
[321:30.83]Pick up the baby.
[321:34.75]Pick up the baby.
[321:35.85]No, don't put him back on the floor.
[321:39.01]Rad hates this.
[321:54.81]Where's the baby sleep?
[322:06.58]Why they keep saying no toilet?
[322:08.46]No toilet.
[322:11.78]Why are they saying no toilet?
[322:17.62]We need a crib.
[322:21.22]We need a crib.
[322:26.97]Where do you get a crib?
[322:30.56]Why can't I just get like a big fucking bed?
[322:32.38]Put the baby in there.
[322:34.84]Can I put like wood on this?
[323:04.76]crib.
[323:05.08]I need to... Where's a crib?
[323:10.90]I don't see a crib.
[323:11.62]Headroom?
[323:16.62]Dining room?
[323:19.91]Oh, kids room.
[323:21.11]Okay, right.
[323:26.79]Um...
[323:47.80]I need a bigger house.
[323:50.02]Alright.
[324:19.02]Alright, put Chello in the crib.
[324:22.33]There we go.
[324:23.05]Good.
[324:27.05]Alright, we did it.
[324:40.66]You gonna upload the 3am vid on your main channel?
[324:43.38]I don't- probably not.
[324:44.24]Oh, it's Rad's birthday, right.
[324:53.69]Uh, can I buy a cake or something?
[325:04.35]We're gonna get a cake.
[325:09.73]Yeah, I'm gonna buy you a car.
[325:17.75]Do you dislike the vibe of the folks from the old channel?
[325:20.91]Not at all.
[325:25.24]No, not at all.
[325:27.04]That's not even remotely what I think.
[325:29.44]They have vibe.
[325:35.68]Yeah, what do you mean?
[325:38.11]Alright, that's it.
[325:39.31]That's it.
[325:39.79]I'm done.
[325:41.45]I'll see you guys on Thursday for the Battleship Tournament.
[325:44.79]I'll be in pre-stream hanging out with you.
[325:47.83]I'll be in the chat room.
[325:49.85]I'm going to run some more ads.
[325:51.19]I'm actually going to do an experiment here.
[325:53.03]I'm curious.
[325:57.34]Let me see how... Let me see if I can do this more than once.
[326:00.93]Alright, it's ad time.
[326:05.81]I will see you guys on Thursday.
[326:06.89]Thanks for watching The Sims 3.
[326:07.85]Next time you see this, there's going to be a shitload of mods on here and it's going to be hell.
[326:13.33]This stream was really just to kind of chill and announce that stream event week.
[326:20.66]I'm insanely excited for it.
[326:23.54]by far the biggest thing I've ever done both logistically and monetarily and it should be a lot of fun regardless of if it goes to plan we'll see but it's gonna be a lot of fun I think it'll be at least worth watching incredibly excited so let's do some more ads and we will call it here put that up let me save the game first very important
[326:58.74]and we're gonna do three minutes if you're gonna take off then we'll see you again I'll be back on I will not be live on this channel but I will be live on lidwigs like last time and we'll see you later see you in a couple days let me run the ads now let's try it again uh let's do three minutes
[327:30.87]Okay.
[327:34.33]Nearly 6 a.m.
[327:35.13]where you are?
[327:37.11]Yeah, and thanks for watching, too.
[327:39.03]I know that this was a little different of a stream.
[327:41.82]Kind of experimenting with some ad content.
[327:52.72]I wonder if I can do it again at the outro.
[327:56.70]Should we try?
[328:00.83]Is the Dollhouse stream gonna be your peak?
[328:02.69]No.
[328:04.41]No.
[328:06.19]There are things that I have planned that I want to do after the Dollhouse stream that are gonna be even more ridiculous.
[328:13.08]One thing that I really want to do, and I'm not gonna give you a date for this, but over the next year or so, I really, really want to get done something I've been trying to do for years now, and it will probably happen.
[328:31.02]The Jerma Rumble live on Twitch, actually live.
[328:35.44]That's what I really want to do next year.
[328:38.36]So once you start hearing me talk about that, some point probably in 2022 is when I really want to get that off the ground.
[328:56.30]And in my 10 year on Twitch tweet,
[329:00.60]I mentioned that I don't really know how much longer I'm going to be around on Twitch for.
[329:06.33]I don't have a set date for it, but when you go over 10 years, you start thinking about all the things that you really kind of want to do.
[329:13.13]And I would be very upset with myself years down the road if while I had the audience that is here right now, and while I had the means to do so, that I didn't try over the next few years or so, at least the next few years, to really try to get some of this stuff done that I've always really wanted to do.
[329:35.57]And really trying to just step on the gas as hard as I can.
[329:40.85]He's quitting.
[329:41.69]No, no, I'm just saying, like, look at where this channel is now.
[329:47.88]I would be very upset with myself if I did not at least try to do something.
[329:51.76]Well, there's many of you here, and I'm... It's insane to think about the amount of people that have come to this channel over the last year or two.
[330:03.20]um so I I'm gonna keep doing stuff as long as I'm able to and as long as I want to go out on top I don't have a plan to go out my point I'm making is that
[330:23.09]I don't have a time period where I know how much longer I'm going to do this for, but I know it's already been 10 years.
[330:29.70]So while I'm at the level I'm at now, both mentally, even potentially physically trying to get healthier and stuff.
[330:38.81]And while everybody's here and see, I got to step on the gas and we've got to go as hard as we can.
[330:49.13]And let's see.
[330:50.34]I wonder, can I do it again?
[330:55.52]Can I do it again?
[330:56.40]Let me see here.
[331:01.37]I'm not going to do it over the credits, though.
[331:11.31]Don't push yourself too hard.
[331:12.85]No, I'm being very cautious of that as well.
[331:15.93]Because I still have a bunch of this medical bullshit.
[331:19.67]After the VR streams, it was really clear again that I'm just not at 100% or even close.
[331:27.50]But I can at least be close enough with some therapeutic stuff.
[331:34.07]And with time off and... But it should be okay.
[331:45.08]But I am very, very happy.
[331:47.22]I'm very excited.
[331:49.14]We're going to try to run another three minutes of ads right at the very end here.
[331:55.79]See if I can do it.
[331:56.55]I'm curious.
[332:04.73]We're not going anywhere.
[332:10.25]I'm surprised.
[332:12.99]I'm very happy about that, but I'm surprised.
[332:15.99]It's been a long time.
[332:25.34]I actually got ads that time.
[332:29.45]Uh-oh.
[332:31.39]It's breaking through.
[332:32.47]We're actually infiltrating.
[332:34.27]We're getting through.
[332:39.84]But thanks for the subs.
[332:40.56]There was a lot.
[332:41.14]There was... Somebody gave a shitload.
[332:45.86]Thank you.
[332:59.31]Jeremy, you can't leave.
[333:00.19]I just found you.
[333:02.15]I'm not going anywhere.
[333:02.91]I'll be around.
[333:07.01]As long as I'm able to.
[333:09.09]There's still things that I need to do, right?
[333:12.37]What's that?
[333:12.71]I'm like a ghost, guys.
[333:13.81]I can't, I cannot go away until I fulfill the reason why I'm here.
[333:20.60]I have, the, the, Jerma Rumble Live on Twitch has to happen.
[333:25.22]I, I can't, I cannot go until I fulfill my destiny.
[333:30.64]And then the next one after that, and then the next one.
[333:32.26]I'm, I can't go anywhere.
[333:33.28]I'm, I'm, I'm the ghost that haunts your computer.
[333:37.33]Alright, let's see if I can do another three minutes.
[333:39.37]After this three minutes is up, I will see you later.
[333:41.89]Thank you for watching again.
[333:44.26]We'll see you Thursday for the Battleship Tournament.
[333:46.36]I'm in the semi-finale.
[333:48.04]Semi-final.
[333:49.24]I believe versus Stans.
[333:52.46]I think.
[333:54.10]We'll see.
[333:55.54]I'm going to try to run the ads again.
[333:56.58]And here we go.
[334:01.82]The ad failed to run because the channel recently ran an ad.
[334:05.40]Alright, well, we're going to wait one minute and 21 seconds.
[334:14.71]I got a big red marker.
[334:16.45]It's like, excuse me.
[334:17.31]Yeah, we'll do it one more time.
[334:34.82]What time on Thursday is the battleship thing?
[334:36.59]I think we're shooting for 2 p.m.
[334:39.75]Pacific on Ludwig's channel.
[334:42.75]And I'll be around on Thursday afternoon, so I'll let you guys know what's going on.
[334:51.31]Can I run it?
[334:51.83]Come on, I gotta run these ads.
[334:57.78]And there's one good thing, I guess.
[335:01.34]I think I'm turning pre-rolls off when I do this.
[335:06.95]for a pretty extended period of time.
[335:09.19]Alright, let's see if I can run it.
[335:24.74]Three minutes.
[335:25.14]There it goes.
[335:26.40]Alright, we currently have three minutes going.
[335:29.84]I didn't realize it was going to do that.
[335:33.65]Pre-rolls are disabled.
[335:34.99]I keep, like, adding to my pre-roll disabled thing.
[335:59.80]Epo happy.
[336:00.50]Well, thank you, guys.
[336:13.87]Two more minutes.
[336:14.51]You're the only stream that makes me laugh and cry.
[336:33.08]Well, come on.
[336:34.98]Comedy and tragedy.
[336:35.76]Those are the two masks.
[336:37.00]Gotta do them both.
[336:45.10]You're gonna do a mobile game stream?
[336:46.84]That I actually was going to do.
[336:48.22]I had like 70 mobile games on my iPad.
[336:52.98]But, they just sucked.
[336:55.93]And I tried to go through so many of them, I was gonna do a stream.
[336:59.15]And it was just, they were terrible.
[337:01.09]They weren't even funny.
[337:02.63]They were loud.
[337:03.45]They were annoying.
[337:04.25]Half of them didn't work.
[337:06.89]Half of them were just menus and shit.
[337:08.39]And it was just like, this is awful.
[337:12.30]I want to do that, but I definitely want to do... Because I feel like that would get kind of exhausting after a while.
[337:18.31]If we get 40, 50 games deep on iPad.
[337:21.57]And everyone just wants to stop.
[337:24.69]It's like, holy shit, man, I can't even take this anymore.
[337:27.25]Like an hour would go by and that would happen.
[337:37.88]Play a mobile game and jump into the game with ads.
[337:40.30]You know, actually, it was a recommendation a while ago that I thought was hilarious.
[337:44.68]And that was to open up my iPad, go to YouTube, and just open up videos until I got a mobile ad.
[337:54.33]And then just download that game and just continue to download every ad that I get.
[338:02.39]Then I was like, that's probably a bad idea.
[338:06.62]Just go to every ad game.
[338:09.94]Ad jumping, yeah.
[338:10.68]Alright, I'll see you later.
[338:19.62]I'll see you in a couple days.
[338:20.50]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[338:24.24]Hopefully this experiment went well.
[338:27.61]I will see you Thursday.
[338:29.57]We have a lot more to talk about.
[338:30.69]There's other people involved that I need to tell you about.
[338:38.68]Have a great night.
[338:39.91]I will see you Thursday.
[338:41.69]Bye.
[338:42.33]Take care.
[338:43.86]Have a great... How about three more ads?
[338:45.10]How about three more minutes of ads?
[338:46.62]No, I'm just kidding.
[338:48.07]I'll see you later.
[339:10.73]you
