[00:01.84]How does my headphones... How do they always get so tangled?
[00:05.94]I don't understand.
[00:06.50]No matter what I do.
[00:10.91]I put them down.
[00:13.17]And then they just end up in like a... Looks like a nest.
[00:17.11]Like a sparrow's nest.
[00:18.33]I don't understand how it happens.
[00:25.99]So here's the plan for tonight.
[00:30.03]If you're curious.
[00:32.47]So we are going to play Thief Simulator for a little while.
[00:39.59]And who knows, we might... Thief Simulator might be so much fun that we just can't stop playing it.
[00:47.72]But if it gets to be like an hour or two in and it's like, okay, that's pretty much all there is to this one, then we'll probably end up moving back to Red Dead.
[01:00.06]Or something else.
[01:02.02]Because there are a lot of options.
[01:03.24]There's a ton of things that have come out.
[01:07.65]So, we'll see.
[01:09.61]To give you guys more of an update on the green screen, the green screen has been officially pushed to Friday.
[01:16.57]I figured Thursday is kind of a weird day.
[01:19.66]I'd rather try to get as many people to be able to watch it as possible.
[01:24.97]So, like, Friday night, Friday afternoon, I feel like is the best time.
[01:28.51]The start of the weekend.
[01:31.03]Because Thursday afternoon is just an odd time.
[01:35.65]So, and speaking of that, speaking of the green screen, I do have something for you to vote on.
[01:45.17]So, for those of you that missed the, I guess, everything we've talked about so far.
[01:52.18]Why don't I just let my intro go for like two or three minutes, you know?
[01:56.12]Because people are going to be coming in.
[01:57.98]So, give me two minutes.
[01:59.99]We'll talk about this when I get back.
[02:01.81]BRB.
[03:04.85]Okay.
[03:06.23]So... Originally, when I first talked about the green screen, it was... Hey, we're gonna do the green screen, and... There's gonna be... There's gonna be all these voting periods, and I'm not gonna know what the actions are, and... There's gonna be a secret and a surprise that's not happening anymore.
[03:21.16]I threw that out last week.
[03:22.82]So... I went through and I picked... From that channel... On the Discord... A ton... Of actions.
[03:31.03]There are so many actions we'll be doing on Friday...
[03:34.15]But sometimes there's just too many, right?
[03:37.35]And some of them were a little on the meme-y side.
[03:40.84]A little on, like, the internet meme side.
[03:46.02]And I figured, you know, I ain't doing a fucking Fortnite dance.
[03:49.68]I already took that off.
[03:52.00]So, not even available.
[03:54.97]So what you're going to vote for on this poll is your favorite one of these fucking memes.
[04:01.98]Because I'm only going to pick the top three.
[04:05.54]So you got until tomorrow.
[04:08.68]Or maybe even tonight.
[04:12.09]The poll is about to go into the chat.
[04:13.77]And we will sit here and just look at it for a minute.
[04:17.23]So here are... And remember, keep this in mind.
[04:20.85]This is not even a taste of the hundreds of actions that will be happening during this stream.
[04:28.71]So there you are.
[04:31.16]We've got... You gotta pick your favorite one.
[04:34.98]Out of all those.
[04:36.95]We've got the Sonic Run.
[04:41.45]The Macarena.
[04:44.27]Do the John Travolta thing.
[04:48.01]Do various CSI Sunglasses one-liners.
[04:53.64]Spin around in So Long King Bowers or something.
[04:59.12]Do Infinity War shit.
[05:02.24]Recreate the original Up in Smoke Bee video.
[05:05.80]Dark Souls praise the sun and other Dark Souls gestures.
[05:10.85]And then do JoJo poses.
[05:15.31]I don't know what that even means.
[05:19.55]What is do JoJo poses?
[05:21.88]I don't even know what that is.
[05:32.91]It's okay.
[05:33.35]Well, it wasn't a fortnight dance.
[05:34.71]So I didn't beat should I have vetoed that?
[05:43.78]This is so once that why is why is this so one-sided right now?
[05:51.06]Veto Jojo's I didn't I didn't know what it was I vetoed dab I vetoed default fortnight dance and I vetoed reenact the whole gnome video I ain't doing it.
[06:00.95]I can't be worse than those.
[06:01.91]I
[06:05.53]Is it worse than those?
[06:07.24]I only got three vetoes.
[06:12.90]Did I fuck myself?
[06:16.95]Did I just fuck myself over so bad by not vetoing the JoJo poses?
[06:26.95]Look him up.
[06:27.67]Well, whatever.
[06:29.93]So, by the way, the top three... The top three will be brought in.
[06:37.12]Because there are so many things.
[06:38.62]I could just open up the list.
[06:39.88]You know, I'm gonna open up the list.
[06:42.28]And I'm just gonna read you, like, two things, okay?
[06:46.74]Here's a couple of great ones.
[06:48.12]By the way, I got hundreds of actions.
[06:49.58]Just make sure you're aware of that.
[06:52.92]I can't wait to do a full weather report in a suit.
[06:57.60]That's gonna be fucking fun.
[07:00.59]Uh, I'm looking forward to... Act like an alien is bursting out of your chest.
[07:05.98]That's gonna be a lot of fun.
[07:11.56]Dude, the Looney Tunes outro!
[07:14.44]That's gonna be fun too!
[07:17.86]There's so many of these.
[07:19.28]This is gonna... Oh god.
[07:22.76]So, uh... This... I'm gonna... I'm gonna take a lot of time.
[07:26.87]I'm gonna do like some rehearsal for this.
[07:34.06]There's plenty of stuff here.
[07:40.08]Okay, so does that include, like, the Porky Pig?
[07:44.16]Am I gonna have to, like, put my hands out to the sides and go like, That's all, folks!
[07:48.84]Is that, like, what it is?
[07:49.44]That's what it is, right?
[07:57.15]Well, this should be a lot of fun.
[08:00.78]that can just turn into a stream outro and again let me reiterate this one more time because people I think I'm confusing a lot of people and because we're getting you know three four days out three days out here let me make sure people are aware of what's going on because I feel like a lot of people still have no idea what I'm doing what is the Sonic run I don't I don't know the Sonic which I when your hands are behind your back and you like run with your head down but isn't that like naruto
[08:30.81]I don't know.
[08:32.91]Why would that be the Sonic run?
[08:35.23]But whatever.
[08:36.69]Anyways.
[08:38.31]After this green screen is filmed, two, maybe three weeks later, depending on how much time I want to... I would say two weeks is good.
[08:48.88]Two weeks later, this is not a contest, we're going to have a movie night where we watch the shit that you guys made.
[08:59.53]There will be rules, and I will talk about them at great length after the stream is done.
[09:04.72]On what is going to happen.
[09:07.08]But, all of these videos that we'll be watching will be pre-screened.
[09:14.48]They have to be at least 10 seconds long, and they have to be no more than 2 minutes long.
[09:22.72]So, those are the rules.
[09:24.84]Nobody, there's no contest, there's no like, somebody wins, somebody loses, we're just gonna have fun.
[09:32.68]But, we're here.
[09:35.28]It's time to play Thief Simulator for a little while.
[09:40.11]Do they have to be school appropriate?
[09:43.21]Yes, they have to be very appropriate.
[09:49.27]You have to be able to sit down next to your parents and watch these.
[10:03.13]Alright, let me drop this down.
[10:04.35]That poll will be going until at least tonight.
[10:08.31]Family movie night.
[10:09.15]No, it doesn't have to be family friendly per se.
[10:13.54]But it can't just... You don't... Listen.
[10:17.16]Do I need to spell it out for you?
[10:20.76]Hold on, let me just get this on here.
[10:28.42]Alright, I'll spell it out for you.
[10:30.25]No sexual content...
[10:33.65]No hateful bullshit.
[10:38.35]Fun.
[10:39.97]There can be violence, there can be weird shit, but none of that bullshit, okay?
[10:50.62]And they're all going to be pre-screened anyway, so we'll be fine.
[10:57.86]Alright, I'm ready.
[11:02.57]Anything is sexual to me.
[11:04.25]What does that even mean?
[11:05.35]Wait, are JoJo poses all sexual?
[11:13.38]No, they're not.
[11:19.86]No, they're not.
[11:24.95]And look, we're gonna have fun with it, but... You guys know.
[11:29.79]You all understand...
[11:34.74]Use common sense.
[11:37.26]You can be stupid.
[11:39.00]You can be weird.

[12:54.73]You just couldn't hear it because I'm an idiot.
[12:57.10]Any FOV slider?
[12:59.39]I don't think so.

[25:08.82]It's time for Greenview 109.
[25:11.54]Get me that TV, and don't pawn it off.
[25:23.26]I don't think you can... No.
[25:29.76]Sorry, guys.
[25:30.40]I tried.
[25:31.48]Big items.
[25:33.50]Don't pawn the TV, he said.
[25:43.37]Oh, right.
[25:43.83]I can't... I'm so used to, like, GTA.
[25:45.75]Alright, let's go to Greenview.
[25:54.15]Big bits only.
[26:02.12]Okay.
[26:02.56]Steal an old TV from Greenview 109.
[26:04.86]Load it in the car trunk and drive home.
[26:09.20]Alright, 109.
[26:09.98]It's right here.
[26:19.25]That's not suspicious.
[26:22.72]There's nobody here!
[26:24.54]Whoa!
[26:34.47]Alright, remember the back.
[26:38.17]There's nobody even in the house.
[26:39.25]I could just take my time.
[26:44.27]What is this?
[26:47.60]Who has a dumpster back here?
[26:49.89]You have a dumpster in the back of your house?
[26:51.33]This dumpster is almost as big as your whole house.
[26:54.10]You could fit a bedroom in here.
[26:55.16]Alright.
[26:57.04]There's the damage fence.
[26:58.90]Get that open.
[27:13.13]Alright.
[27:14.30]So, wait, we got a spare key, right?
[27:18.05]What does the spare key go to?
[27:19.71]Front door.
[27:30.43]Got it.
[27:34.47]What else you got in here?
[27:35.51]Toaster!
[27:36.23]We know those are expensive.
[27:37.81]Fridge.
[27:44.24]Money in the trash.
[27:48.02]Anything in the bathtub?
[27:52.56]Ketchup bottle?
[27:53.16]No.
[27:54.92]Alright, so old TV.
[27:55.96]Hold on.
[28:00.54]Yeah, here we go.
[28:02.76]Okay.
[28:04.91]Carry.
[28:11.53]Can you, like, throw... Can I throw it?
[28:16.95]Nope.
[28:17.62]No, not really.
[28:18.26]Okay, well, whatever.
[28:21.64]Oh, shit!
[28:21.94]There's a person right here.
[28:29.45]Big items.
[28:31.41]To steal a big item, TV or printer, etc., put it in the car's trunk and drive home.
[28:35.65]To sell big items at pawn, you need to put them next to the shop owner.
[28:44.99]It's alright.
[28:46.03]It's just Wilson.
[28:46.95]What's his name next door?
[28:48.71]To Tim Allen?
[28:50.15]The guy with the eyes and the hat?
[28:58.18]She's like standing on the car.
[29:05.59]Get out of the way!
[29:09.21]Can I like throw a coin over there?
[29:18.62]Sprint with a TV.
[29:29.23]Am I gonna be able to sneak behind?
[29:32.03]She's always facing this way.
[29:33.29]But here comes somebody else.
[29:41.10]Wait, is she stuck in the door?
[29:44.00]No, she's not.
[29:44.52]She's just standing here.
[29:51.61]She's just standing here waiting.
[29:53.11]Can I, like, do something?
[29:54.31]Can I, like, push her down?
[29:55.17]Alright, I'll put the TV down.
[30:06.48]What the fuck?
[30:09.76]Oh, fuck.
[30:10.54]Oh, a car!
[30:13.08]Oh, what, is it the homeowner?
[30:19.88]So what am I supposed to do about this?
[30:36.58]Okay.
[30:37.82]So I can't hurt that person?
[30:45.12]It's a thief simulator, not... God, now I gotta do like... Move the car out of the way.
[30:48.91]It's car damage.
[31:03.45]Look at the car.
[31:07.26]And the back fence can be broken easily.
[31:11.68]Really?
[31:23.61]Okay, come on.
[31:24.99]Get out of... Alright, that's fine.
[31:32.74]Get the TV.
[31:33.58]Give me the money, too.
[31:50.53]Leave a big shit in this toilet?
[32:00.53]That's disgusting.
[32:02.31]Oh, there's money down here.
[32:10.41]Put the TV down.
[32:11.45]I want that money.
[32:14.29]Yeah, big items have got to be put in the trunk.
[32:18.63]Before the lady gets here.
[32:22.79]She's about to cross right now.
[32:27.23]No, she's not.
[32:28.85]No, I got the back.
[32:30.19]I'm in the back.
[32:36.77]She's in the sink.
[32:38.55]I'm not going to go to the bathroom in this person's house.
[32:40.93]Okay, guys?
[32:41.51]Please.
[32:48.03]How do I, like, get it out there?
[32:55.85]Alright, load up the old TV.
[32:56.97]Alright.
[33:01.39]Get it in the trunk.
[33:19.57]Okay.
[33:21.54]Well, that's one way to do it.
[33:22.72]Alright, I'm ready.
[33:24.00]Okay.
[33:30.65]Uh, steal a TV from- load it in the car and drive out of here.
[33:33.15]We're gonna take this road.
[33:40.72]How do I- where's my home?
[33:47.64]Okay.
[33:49.70]Am I going just to drive out?
[33:51.43]Oh, there we go.
[33:53.01]Home.
[33:57.45]Road.
[33:57.91]Old TV, got the key.
[34:01.15]Remember to spend unused skill points.
[34:04.35]S!
[34:05.07]Exclamation point.
[34:05.83]That's better than S+.
[34:09.52]I see you got my screen.
[34:11.88]Go to Black Bay.
[34:21.18]Alright.
[34:21.64]I set up a page on there for the TV.
[34:24.54]Go there and sell it.
[34:26.28]Okay.
[34:27.08]Electronics.
[34:28.50]Old TV, 60 bucks.
[34:31.20]Eh, good work.
[34:32.79]Now, click on the rent a thug tab.
[34:38.25]Now here you can find a little extra work.
[34:41.25]I put one on there just for you.
[34:43.27]The one with the dishes.
[34:45.41]Okay.
[34:47.57]At 110, go break their dishes.
[34:51.20]And that's it.
[34:53.72]This is the equivalent of if you just shit in the toilet and left.
[34:56.68]That's going to be one eventually, isn't it?
[34:58.14]110, break the dishes.
[35:08.19]Okay.
[35:09.97]Leave an upper decker at 111.
[35:13.29]If you don't know what that is, that's when you shit in the water tank.
[35:18.35]You leave it.
[35:31.36]You have to unlock the couch shitting quest.
[35:34.12]Alright, break the dishes at 1-1-10.
[35:44.53]We can't even see it.
[35:45.39]Like, I just wanted to see it.
[35:46.81]We don't even get to see the damn thing.
[35:48.63]What the fuck?
[35:49.41]Did I already do this?
[35:50.73]Okay, good.
[35:54.25]Is there just no ragdoll or physics engine or something?
[35:57.29]What do you mean I didn't even try?
[36:07.22]Sell pots and pans.
[36:08.56]Ah, but he told me to go to 110 and smash dishes, so I gotta do that first.
[36:14.46]He didn't even try to swerve?
[36:15.48]No, I was trying to run that person over.
[36:16.98]I was trying to kill that person.
[36:20.87]Because I wanted, I just needed to know if we could see anything.
[36:23.67]Alright, so 110, smash.
[36:27.07]Alright, well that person, I'm dead.
[36:34.44]I got some dishes to smash!
[36:40.98]Is somebody in this house?
[36:41.78]Uh-oh.
[36:52.33]Windows locked, windows locked.
[36:53.73]That's not going to stop us.
[36:55.94]Get in.
[36:57.84]So now break their dishes.
[37:01.20]I can't even take their toaster or anything.
[37:10.17]That's my house.
[37:11.01]No, it's not.
[37:15.75]I just heard you don't even know how to pick a lock.
[37:19.32]Go learn the basics.
[37:21.20]I'm sure you've got enough skill by now.
[37:23.88]This is it.
[37:27.92]So, they have... They have physics.
[37:32.79]Breakable plates, but not run-over-able humans.
[37:37.11]What's up with that?
[37:47.38]Okay.
[37:48.18]So, that's it.
[37:48.94]Unless it's... What do you got here?
[37:51.20]Deodorant.
[37:52.24]Any money in the line?
[37:53.04]What's wrong with the toilet?
[37:57.07]Okay.
[37:57.51]Well, now there's something very wrong with it.
[38:03.53]Um... Alright.
[38:04.37]Well, that's it.
[38:10.06]Just gotta get back in the car.
[38:15.48]Sleep in bed.
[38:16.30]You can't sleep in bed.
[38:17.22]All you can do is crawl under it.
[38:24.21]Car.
[38:26.27]For a second I thought somebody was in the car.
[38:31.49]No, I'm not gonna crawl under it.
[38:32.80]I already did that.
[38:33.58]Alright, let's leave.
[38:39.30]That is the drive to the edge of the universe here.
[38:42.64]What's beep?
[38:51.76]Can you even... Can you even get in a car accident?
[38:54.44]You probably can't.
[39:00.14]Cook poop or pre-recorded?
[39:01.88]Wait, hold on, this... I don't have that.
[39:28.92]I can't even break them mailboxes.
[39:30.24]Yeah, let's go.
[39:54.48]How is that a C?
[39:55.38]Alright Vinny, give me a call.
[39:59.90]Learn lockpicking level one.
[40:03.48]From where?
[40:04.28]Over here.
[40:12.35]Rent a thug.
[40:16.31]Let me sell all this shit, though.
[40:19.88]Kitchen.
[40:20.78]Other.
[40:21.58]Antiques.
[40:22.50]Art.
[40:23.76]Oh, this is what they want.
[40:25.12]Somebody wants this stuff.
[40:31.22]So it's just like here.
[40:32.48]Okay.
[40:32.88]Skills.
[40:35.26]What is... Lockpicking level one.
[40:38.16]Open easy locks and lockpicks.
[40:40.14]Sure thing.
[40:41.18]Notes.
[40:43.99]Okay.
[40:44.65]We got some... We got that job done.
[40:48.25]Skills.
[40:48.71]We just learned lockpicking.
[40:50.17]Here's Vinny.
[40:50.79]Okay.
[41:01.91]DIY simple lock pick.
[41:04.91]I have $230, got it.
[41:08.31]Before you get yourself into trouble, try it on a training lock.
[41:12.97]I left one in the garage.
[41:38.03]Aw, that's too bad.
[41:39.31]I was thinking it was gonna just do, like, seven days.
[41:42.77]It's Jerma's day?
[41:43.99]What?
[41:47.50]Okay, let's open it.
[41:49.48]So, you need to find the right angle with the Bobby pin and then rotate the lock.
[41:53.84]The closer the pin gets to the correct angle, more the lock will rotate.
[42:01.75]So, rotate is just D. Okay, so this is just...
[42:07.78]This is just, like, Fallout.
[42:09.42]Okay.
[42:25.08]Somebody in jail?
[42:26.02]When close enough, you can mark a tenant to discover his daily routines.
[42:30.21]Middle mouse button.
[42:31.39]Okay.
[42:31.79]You can also mark cameras to show their viewing angle.
[42:34.81]View range.
[42:35.35]Check tenant routines in the top right corner.
[42:37.15]Blue means they are out.
[42:38.01]Tenant routines are also available in the notes menu.
[42:41.95]Okay.
[42:44.07]So, go to 111 around 7am.
[42:48.49]And mark the tenant.
[42:53.27]So, let's give us a little bit of time here.
[43:01.25]It's 5 a.m.
[43:01.77]I'm really gonna turn off the stereo before I go to bed.
[43:10.48]Sell your stuff?
[43:11.48]I... I can't.
[43:13.36]Nobody wants it.
[43:16.88]Missing required items.
[43:17.86]I can't.
[43:18.20]The golden goblet.
[43:19.96]Car parts.
[43:20.44]Electronics.
[43:21.02]I can't.
[43:21.92]Kitchen.
[43:23.23]Go to the pawn shop?
[43:27.95]Yeah, but I'm on like a time limit now.
[43:29.81]I would have woken up at 4 o'clock in the morning.
[43:40.46]What time is it right now?
[43:43.25]5.20 a.m.
[43:43.51]Alright, I gotta make this quick.
[43:44.87]Welcome back.
[43:47.25]Alright, so, saucepan... That's all I bring into this guy.
[43:57.25]Hey, Jeremy.
[43:57.67]Hey, man, what's up?
[43:58.93]Uh, you got the usual?
[43:59.71]Yeah, I got a couple of toasters, uh, pots and pans, um, and a vase.
[44:05.13]Oh, sweet, dude.
[44:06.47]Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow with the same stuff.
[44:13.57]At what point is this guy gonna hold his hand up and be like, Jeremy, Jeremy, you've given me, like, 30 toasters, man, and nobody buys them.
[44:20.51]Okay, so it's 5 a.m., just gotta get to 1-11 around 7 and mark the guy there.
[44:29.39]Is this person in a car or are they walking?
[44:30.95]Okay, they're walking.
[44:32.01]111 was... It's a three-point turn.
[44:38.58]You never seen somebody do that before?
[44:39.68]I just broke the road.
[44:49.45]The road just crumbled underneath me.
[44:52.23]Okay, so let's get out of the way where there's no... out of suspicion.
[45:02.72]Like, under the McDonald's heat lamp.
[45:04.12]That's a great place.
[45:06.28]Right under the light.
[45:07.95]Alright, it's 7am.
[45:08.59]Okay, I gotta get ready.
[45:11.03]I gotta get a good vantage point.
[45:13.95]Up on the seesaw.
[45:17.61]Okay, what time is it?
[45:19.31]6.30.
[45:20.61]He's right there.
[45:24.62]Sleeping in the parking lot.
[45:27.94]Sleep in the car at the parking lot to pass time.
[45:30.50]Okay.
[45:34.72]There's a box in there.
[45:36.75]Wait for them to leave and get me that box.
[45:40.85]So, go sleep, wait for them... Okay.
[45:43.79]Hint discovered.
[45:44.25]Important box inside.
[45:45.25]So, what about his routines here?
[45:48.55]Living room or out.
[45:57.17]I can just sit here and wait, though.
[45:58.99]Wouldn't I rather do it like this?
[46:00.59]No, look at the timer up there.
[46:02.10]He'll be out of the living room
[46:06.80]He just looked over here.
[46:11.49]So I gotta sprint in and grab the box.
[46:19.15]I can look at every inch of this guy's entire house.
[46:21.39]I don't even need a camera.
[46:23.41]I just move back and forth.
[46:24.89]I am the camera.
[46:25.65]Alright, we need like a point of interest though.
[46:29.49]He's standing up to change the channel on the TV.
[46:31.67]Are you sure he's not using the toaster?
[46:36.53]He might be.
[46:50.24]So, alright.
[46:50.96]Go sleep in my car.
[46:54.32]So, it is currently 7.47 a.m.
[47:01.06]So, sleep in car.
[47:05.48]How do I sleep in the car?
[47:06.68]I have to sleep in the trunk?
[47:14.60]How do I sleep in here?
[47:20.22]Oh, I have to be over there.
[47:27.18]Hey, watch this.
[47:27.82]Want me to be the ultimate asshole?
[47:33.79]Ain't nobody parking here.
[47:38.21]Alright, let's sleep until 9 AM.
[47:43.28]That was a good nap.
[47:44.58]Alright, where is he?
[47:58.53]Is he gone?
[48:04.73]Oh!
[48:16.40]Is that him?
[48:34.40]Oh, I took the most important thing in his whole house, guys.
[48:36.94]I took the TV.
[48:43.69]How is he going to change the channels now?
[48:46.85]Actually, okay.
[48:47.89]Hold on.
[48:48.54]He's got barred windows.
[49:09.96]Get me out of here.
[49:11.88]Am I stuck back here?
[49:15.23]How did I?
[49:15.85]Wait.
[49:16.19]Oh my god.
[49:30.94]Go through.
[49:31.70]You can't go through.
[49:42.23]Come on, come on, come on.
[49:42.91]I want the TV, too.
[49:44.03]I'll get them both.
[49:49.50]Come on, come on.
[49:50.16]He's still out.
[49:50.68]I'm still good.
[49:58.26]Hold shift.
[49:58.70]You can't run with the TV.
[50:06.26]I got another item.
[50:07.82]Important box.
[50:17.62]Alright, he's got money.
[50:18.86]He's got a lot of money.
[50:19.92]Take it.
[50:20.70]That's a lot of money.
[50:21.56]Where's the box?
[50:45.32]I made it.
[50:55.62]Every single victim needs to have a smashed toilet.
[51:00.73]No.
[51:04.71]Alright, so... Wait till no one's home and steal the important box.
[51:15.78]How did I not steal the box?
[51:20.87]Box with shady content.
[51:22.89]That's not it?
[51:28.62]So why is it telling me to still do it?
[51:37.70]Just leave.
[51:38.22]Whoa, why wouldn't it just say leave?
[51:40.38]I got it.
[51:46.71]Let's go home first, then I'm going to pawn the TV.
[51:53.91]That's all I want is a B. Remember to spend unused skill points.
[51:56.41]I got a B. I'll take it.
[51:59.89]New hints now.
[52:00.51]Level up.
[52:01.03]So, what can I level up?
[52:08.37]This seems like a branching Diablo II skill tree here.
[52:10.71]Alright, we've got lockpicking level 2.
[52:16.33]I need to go from here.
[52:18.52]So, open normal locks with a lockpick.
[52:21.88]Open easy locks.
[52:22.96]Okay.
[52:23.64]Well, now we opened it up.
[52:28.10]More notes.
[52:31.03]So he's out between 9 a.m.
[52:34.31]and 11 a.m., and he's asleep from 6 a.m.
[52:39.45]until 11.
[52:40.17]That's not correct.
[52:42.46]There's two people that live in this house.
[52:44.60]Okay.
[52:49.76]Yeah, he's asleep from 5 a.m.
[52:52.26]to 11, and he's out from 9 a.m.
[52:55.60]to 11.
[52:56.41]Okay, so he sleepwalks.
[52:58.69]He goes and makes eggs at the neighbor's house.
[53:02.61]Okay, let's go.
[53:10.38]Let's see what I can do here.
[53:11.54]Send the box via Black Bay.
[53:15.64]Just keep taking that guy's TV.
[53:18.92]Okay, we got other box with shady content.
[53:24.01]It's a hundred bucks.
[53:27.57]Okay, nice.
[53:30.24]Vinny, what's next?
[53:31.18]Smash a window in 1.12 and then hide or run away.
[53:33.98]Got it.
[53:34.34]Smash a window in 1.12.
[53:35.94]But first... Let's see what we can get for this television.
[54:07.20]Welcome back.
[54:08.92]Big item.
[54:18.08]TV.
[54:18.52]$40 for the TV.
[54:21.00]And another pot.
[54:24.09]I got some money now.
[54:29.47]You wish your thieves were as incompetent as Jerma.
[54:32.33]I don't do thievery.
[54:35.31]I don't break into people's houses.
[54:37.95]Of course, why would I be good at something that I don't do?
[54:43.43]Can you believe this guy?
[54:44.39]He can't even perform like a heart surgery.
[54:46.44]I've never fucking performed heart surgery.
[55:00.59]Alright, 112. 112.
[55:06.63]Those two things equatable.
[55:11.20]Because I don't know how to do things I don't know how to do and I've never done.
[55:13.58]I don't know what like a lockpick does.
[55:17.08]I've never even touched one.
[55:18.27]I've never held one in my hand.
[55:26.49]Now these ones are up here.
[55:27.53]Alright, let's park it.
[55:37.06]I don't even know what it does.
[55:42.88]Break a window in 112, then hide or run.
[55:47.92]So I'm just like a regular person, right?
[55:49.78]So I don't have to worry about it.
[55:50.62]If they see me, as long as I don't have the crowbar out, I'm fine.
[55:54.24]So this is 112.
[55:54.76]Can I peek?
[55:57.42]Can I jump?
[56:03.19]You put the lockpick in the thing and rotate the lock.
[56:05.53]That's not how it works.
[56:22.96]I can't climb a fence because I don't have enough agility.
[56:25.34]Okay.
[56:27.32]Uh, well, is somebody in the house?
[56:31.30]Can I reach from here?
[56:35.72]Just throw the crowbar in there.
[56:45.21]Is somebody in the house?
[56:46.33]No one's in the house.
[56:50.66]Whoa!
[57:01.41]I was just about to rob you.
[57:02.97]Alright, I got two people marked.
[57:04.47]They're at the garden.
[57:05.79]They go to the garden now.
[57:08.88]Break their window.
[57:09.72]Alright, so I gotta break this.
[57:10.76]I'm sprinting right behind me.
[57:11.68]Here we go.
[57:12.14]One, two, three, action.
[57:17.76]What is this?
[57:19.26]Stealing stuff while returning home with loot gives you extra experience points.
[57:23.10]The first time theft will give ten times more experience.
[57:27.71]If you're not sure what to do, check your computer.
[57:30.63]Alright, why are the police here?
[57:32.67]The police are called?
[57:33.66]Hide?
[57:35.56]Where do I hide?
[57:38.76]Oh, they have an alarm.
[57:39.68]Hide in the dumpster.
[57:50.79]You can run away from police by leaving the neighborhood or you can hide in a closet a dumpster under the bed and wait for the police to leave If the visibility eye is red someone saw you and the police will find you No one's gonna find me no one saw me go into this particular That is if you go in this dumpster
[58:27.36]When does this stop?
[58:36.56]Uh, do I have to run away?
[58:43.85]You live here now.
[58:44.99]Uh...
[58:58.58]I feel like this is supposed to be done.
[59:00.67]Should I get out?
[59:08.47]How would they know it's you?
[59:09.55]That's a good question.
[59:10.25]Alright, I'm going to get out and sprint to the left as fast as I can.
[59:14.65]Oh, the music's off.
[59:15.61]The music's done.
[59:19.65]There's one star now.
[59:22.27]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[59:23.05]They're leaving.
[59:37.17]There were no police after all.
[59:38.39]Alright, where's my car?
[59:40.55]Over here.
[59:45.74]Somebody was just playing police sounds to scare me.
[59:50.86]What would you be suspicious of?
[59:51.78]I don't have anything up.
[59:54.20]Why are there people surrounding my car?
[60:04.97]In a strange place.
[60:14.00]Uh... The police are gonna tow my car.
[60:23.85]What?
[60:24.67]Get... Don't hit him!
[60:28.47]Don't!
[60:28.85]I can't go anywhere!
[60:29.71]Either one of these two.
[60:37.74]Open a standard training lock.
[60:51.29]Oh, I did it.
[60:51.89]I win.
[60:56.57]This is so unsettling.
[60:57.97]Alright, we got easy lock.
[61:03.21]Standard lock.
[61:04.19]Requires a lockpick.
[61:07.88]Do I have to buy a lockpick every time?
[61:10.14]So I don't get to reuse it?
[61:12.42]Oh, man.
[61:13.00]That's where the money sink is, huh?
[61:26.25]Oh, shit!
[61:36.09]Can I pawn those?
[61:37.37]Can I pawn those?
[61:40.35]Hold on.
[61:40.75]Wait, wait, wait.
[61:41.63]Wait.
[61:41.93]Other.
[61:42.17]Anybody need any lockpicks?
[61:45.42]I've got this great idea.
[61:46.46]It's called buy... Buy... Buy shit at premium price.
[61:51.66]Sell for undercut price.
[61:59.06]Oh, God.
[62:00.84]You need to lock the pin while it's at the bottom.
[62:05.29]So... So how do you lock the pin?
[62:08.26]What button do you press?
[62:09.02]Oh, here we go.
[62:11.38]Use a lockpick to open standard locks.
[62:13.60]Press the button at the exact time when a pin is at the bottom.
[62:18.03]Okay.
[62:20.53]But first of all, let me just try to get a super sweet candy crush here.
[62:29.46]Sweet!
[62:29.68]Sweet!
[62:38.76]I have to press S when it's at the bottom, right?
[62:45.02]That's what I just did.
[62:45.56]Do I have to click?
[62:57.75]Mouse zero.
[63:01.34]Okay, so it's mouse zero.
[63:05.68]That's a strange way to call it.
[63:14.95]If it ain't broke, fix it with a crowbar.
[63:18.65]Word on the street is the toilet in Greenview 113 is not broke.
[63:26.02]Really?
[63:28.44]Break the toilet.
[63:31.30]What is this petty bullshit?
[63:34.94]I feel like I'm being contacted by, like, ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends.
[63:38.18]Like, go in there and smash your toilet!
[63:42.02]Go pee on his TV!
[63:48.31]Am I a thief, or am I, like, petty revenge guy?
[63:52.13]Alright, so, uh, I got home.
[63:56.64]Let me, I want to look at this.
[64:00.07]Go pee in his toilet.
[64:01.45]Yeah, go pee in his toilet.
[64:02.83]Alright, we got one month 13.
[64:05.09]Possible loot location.
[64:06.09]Let's see.
[64:07.21]There's a printer worth a lot in the living room.
[64:09.72]These houses are so small at this point in the game that this is... Why would I do this?
[64:14.70]No one is there between 9 and 2.
[64:18.18]And there's a spare key for the front door in the bedroom.
[64:21.65]So between... Let's get there at 9 a.m.
[64:23.67]and let's get the printer.
[64:40.92]Steal the printer ink.
[64:42.26]Yeah, that's worth a lot of money.
[64:44.42]So we're gonna take the, uh, printer.
[64:49.56]And then we're going to break the toilet.
[64:51.06]There's hiring people to prank.
[65:06.12]Did I even pick anything up?
[65:08.18]From my inventory?
[65:09.18]Items.
[65:12.62]I don't have anything.
[65:15.86]Alright, so 113 is the other house that's up on the hill there.
[65:22.19]Spend $200 on hints and get $70 for a printer.
[65:27.27]Yeah, well, I just... That's fine.
[65:45.51]No, I don't want to get arrested.
[65:46.71]I want a perfect record.
[65:59.01]Nice.
[66:14.16]Nice steal.
[66:20.67]I don't want to be arrested.
[66:21.39]Drive straight into the stranger's backyard.
[66:25.85]Well, then they shouldn't put a jump there.
[66:28.86]If they don't want people to try to go off the jump, then there shouldn't be a jump available.
[66:40.53]Look, I'm being very careful now.
[66:54.23]Alright, I need to park this car somewhere where no one's gonna care.
[67:02.45]No one's gonna walk over here, so... Alright, so, between 9 AM, no one's there right now.
[67:11.18]Until 2.
[67:11.52]We got a printer in the living room.
[67:14.82]And we have to smash the toilet.
[67:16.46]So, I got a window... I think I'm gonna... I'm good, nobody's here to see this.
[67:27.29]Oh, man.
[67:31.45]Where's the toilet?
[67:32.63]Where's the toilet?
[67:34.61]Where is it?
[67:38.16]Where's the... Where's the living room?
[67:50.82]Get out.
[67:52.06]Get out.
[67:55.66]Put it down.
[67:56.04]Put it down.
[67:56.28]Put it down.
[67:58.85]Pick it up!
[67:59.65]Why can't I pick the TV up?
[68:01.97]Pick up the TV!
[68:02.97]Oh shit!
[68:48.39]There he is!
[68:50.18]No, that's a wood- that's a- that's a wooden person.

[70:29.67]Okay.
[70:33.45]So I got the front door?
[70:34.41]I can't fit through there.
[70:50.49]Can fit through here though apparently.
[70:56.99]Oh, wait, wait, wait!
[70:57.95]Hint!
[70:58.33]There's a spare key for the front door on the bedroom.

[76:51.29]Is he gonna- Why are they coming over here?
[77:39.97]They're not going to come all the way over here.
[77:42.53]And if they do, I think their AI is not going to be smart enough.
[77:45.22]They're going to run right by me, turn around, and run back.
[77:48.30]I'm, like, wedged up into the wall.
[77:49.70]See?
[77:51.72]I'm going to get caught here, definitely.
[77:53.16]I don't think so, man.

[79:08.86]In fact, I have an opportunity here.
[79:10.04]I need to see if anyone's here.
[79:12.16]I don't see anybody in here.
[79:18.61]Is it in the bathroom, maybe?
[79:23.93]But I have to smash this.
[79:31.53]Well, it is... What the fuck?
[79:33.41]Get out of here.

[79:42.84]Why are they walking... Oh, they're going into their house.
[79:51.65]Oh, no.
[79:52.61]This is their house.
[79:58.92]Is it?
[79:59.20]Or are they just on the road?
[80:04.16]They won't leave.
[80:15.99]Where's my car?
[80:23.93]Where's my car?
[80:24.37]I think we're in the clear.
[80:37.16]Or it is.
[80:38.10]Okay.
[80:38.22]Alright, I need one... 111 is... Unknown.
[80:39.84]Unknown.
[80:47.19]I need to go to 112 and do the same thing.
[80:52.01]Don't walk past people's windows.
[80:53.87]What am I, stupid?
[80:56.39]Alright, police are gone.
[80:59.73]The same shit happened last time, and I got stuck back here.
[81:05.29]What is this here for?
[81:06.33]See, I told you, there's a jump here.
[81:18.58]Oh, there's a guy right there.
[81:19.66]Alright.
[81:19.90]What is this?
[81:20.58]Electricity?
[81:21.08]I have to go all the way around.
[81:31.71]Wait, I can get intel, right?
[81:37.25]I got a new routine.
[81:45.78]Just put it down!
[81:46.22]Put it down!
[82:07.63]I'm under arrest?
[82:09.73]Well, I feel like I could have outran you after you flipped over your fucking squad car.
[82:22.18]Where is this?
[82:24.64]Oh, just right there.
[82:25.50]Alright, so we got a couple of jobs.
[82:34.08]Job...
[82:36.38]Let's go to one.
[82:38.06]The other one's more expensive anyways.
[82:39.62]112.
[82:42.93]You can steal it too.
[82:49.25]You're under arrest.
[82:53.73]You did 112.
[82:55.36]I didn't steal a painting though.
[83:02.62]I need to like go up there.
[83:27.69]No, I can mark this person.
[83:29.25]Oh, wait.
[83:29.55]Hold on.
[83:30.07]Why can I see these people through walls?
[83:31.31]There's a spare key for the front door.
[83:34.31]Okay.
[83:37.59]Well, I know that whole routine.
[83:38.83]112.
[83:40.23]Here we go.
[83:46.62]Break or steal the kiss.
[83:47.84]It's 150 bucks for this.
[83:51.34]Oh, they're both there.
[83:52.12]I wonder if I can get a routine here.
[83:58.92]Well, the painting's in there.
[84:01.36]I could bust the lock, steal the painting, and get out scot-free.
[84:04.94]Okay, look at how long they're in the bedroom here for, though.
[84:11.25]Let's see if I can pick them when they're... Because if they're in the bedroom for that long, I can pop the lock, go grab the painting, and get out.
[84:22.56]But they're at the end of it here.
[84:24.26]It's probably a bad idea.
[84:30.73]Yeah, they're about to be out.
[84:34.23]Should I go for it?
[84:38.24]I'm going for it.
[84:58.61]I didn't.
[84:58.97]I was looking at chat.
[85:00.17]Why would I do that?
[85:13.46]Give me the molar panting.
[85:14.36]Give me like the fucking chew impression.
[85:21.42]What?
[85:25.66]What?
[85:43.77]Oh, which way are they going?
[85:44.99]Which way are they going?
[85:50.18]I think I can make it.
[85:54.16]I think I can make it.
[86:16.67]See ya!
[86:18.85]And I got the painting
[86:43.81]I just walked an antique painting.
[86:45.49]I just walked a full couch through the neighborhood.
[86:51.96]Really?
[86:52.20]Uh, I would give that an A. The amount of preparation and dodging and weaving and... That was not an F. I'm sorry.
[87:01.12]Alright, should I pawn this or should I sell it here?
[87:11.99]Alright.
[87:13.74]Well.
[87:16.04]Um.
[87:17.78]It's not under art.
[87:19.54]Antiques.
[87:20.26]Other.
[87:20.68]Kitchen.
[87:21.96]Electronics.
[87:22.74]Car parts.
[87:23.32]Yeah.
[87:24.56]Alright.
[87:25.51]So.
[87:26.49]Uh.
[87:26.63]I did it.
[87:26.97]I actually still am on that one.
[87:28.77]I gotta pawn this.
[87:38.01]I wonder what it's worth.
[87:39.51]I'm gonna say 500 bucks.
[87:45.33]Scroll down?
[87:45.79]I did scroll.
[87:46.57]I got to the bottom of the scroll.
[87:48.70]Welcome back.
[87:53.16]Well, it's $150 to break the damn thing.
[87:56.50]Go through all the trouble of stealing.
[87:57.60]It has to be something worth doing.
[88:18.32]Alright.
[88:21.67]Apparently not.
[88:23.03]Alright, I need agility level 2.
[88:25.67]Required level 6.
[88:26.79]I just have to keep stealing things?
[88:35.72]That's on top of the 150?
[88:36.48]Yeah, it probably is.
[88:55.16]Alright, so we need to go to one, I just, the only thing I can do here is either just, I can just go into random people's houses.
[89:01.30]Right?
[89:02.66]What's stopping me from doing that?
[89:19.51]What, like 106?
[89:20.43]Let's just case this place.
[89:25.76]Unknown.
[89:26.18]I can't mark you?
[89:34.07]I can see you right through the door.
[89:41.13]Somebody coming down the street.
[89:41.99]What are you doing out this late?
[89:43.67]Get out of here.
[89:46.47]Why are you even on the road?
[89:53.10]Ring the doorbell.
[90:23.34]Got ya.
[90:27.32]What happened to this person?
[90:32.14]What is this person doing?
[90:32.88]Oh, they're going to sleep.
[90:36.41]Alright, I got ya.
[90:39.09]So you are in the kitchen.
[90:41.07]Okay, so he's in there for a while.
[90:43.39]They're both incapacitated for a little while here.
[90:45.53]This person is very restless.
[90:49.45]Alright, let's get in here through the
[91:01.34]Keep an eye on that mini-map for me.
[91:08.43]What the fuck are you doing?
[91:17.20]Oh, the blue is when they're not doing... Really?
[91:24.06]No, looks like we're going to 107.
[91:31.35]The Wilsons have a huge house.
[91:36.77]Just climb over the fence?
[91:37.69]See, I can't.
[91:39.03]I don't know how to use a fence.
[91:44.53]Not until I level up, like, one more time in agility, I can't use a fence.
[91:51.59]I did get some intel, though.
[91:52.71]I need the intel for 107.
[92:04.59]I think there's only one way in to 107.
[92:09.77]Through the front door?
[92:10.49]I can't, like, take the mail?
[92:16.02]Alright, I'm gonna wait.
[92:22.60]Anybody right here?
[92:23.44]I need to wait till you walk by.
[92:27.68]Just walk by so I can open this.
[92:35.68]What's it blinking to?
[92:36.34]It's easy to climb the fence.
[92:37.49]Yeah, yeah.
[92:39.75]Stealing mail is illegal.
[92:42.55]So is smashing windows, taking paintings, and throwing bricks at people.
[92:49.60]Okay.
[92:50.04]Opportunity is arising right... right now.
[93:27.59]Getting gnomed.
[93:30.67]They have all their blinds closed.
[93:35.11]You know, there's probably a mission to do that.
[93:36.72]Alright, here we go.
[93:37.16]Back door.
[93:38.40]I need luck picking three.
[93:39.72]This house is secure.
[93:44.02]Ooh.
[93:44.68]Nope, so is this.
[93:46.20]Alright, we'll just take all the cool stuff they have in their backyard.
[93:51.26]Oh, I'll take that.
[93:52.18]Fifteen bucks.
[93:52.90]We got a radio.
[93:56.04]Wine.
[93:58.18]A couple of nice wines.
[93:59.14]On the grill.
[94:08.87]I want to whip a brick through that window so bad.
[94:10.81]That's it, right?
[94:17.42]What if I do this?
[94:22.72]Can I annoy them enough where they can open the door?
[94:30.81]I can't get in here.
[94:32.97]Leave mud here.
[94:35.27]Where's the doorbell?
[94:36.71]Are they smart and they don't have one?
[94:39.65]Where's your doorbell?
[94:45.59]Fine.
[94:47.51]Throw a brick.
[94:48.39]There is no brick.
[94:50.23]Do you see a brick anywhere?
[94:54.61]How do I throw a brick?
[95:05.02]Throw gnome.
[95:06.68]I don't have anything.
[95:08.38]There's a key definitely under the mat.
[95:19.09]Well, I can't get it.
[95:20.67]Yeah, this house is locked up.
[95:32.71]Holy fuck, that guy could see.
[95:33.93]Alright, what about over here?
[95:34.85]I gotta go craft a brick.
[95:40.98]No, I need, I need to just steal a few more things.
[95:44.62]Alright, here we go.
[95:45.72]104.
[95:48.30]Nobody around.
[95:53.93]What's over in the corner?
[95:54.65]That's mail.
[95:56.15]Alright, the people that are in, the people that are sleeping in here.
[95:57.87]What time is it?
[95:59.11]It's 2 a.m.
[96:02.05]Level 3 lockpick!
[96:03.97]What the... Is that level 3?
[96:23.31]Nope.
[96:23.75]No, it's level 3!
[96:24.29]Shit!
[96:42.56]Shit!
[96:43.12]I was trying to go in with him.
[97:07.85]This one.
[97:08.13]I can open this one.
[97:13.29]Freeze!
[97:19.73]So I can't do any of these houses.
[97:22.37]I need like level 3 lockpicking to even do them.
[97:24.81]I need like other tools.
[97:30.40]Alright, I have to stay away.
[97:31.24]I gotta go to like 101 through 103.
[97:32.22]Apparently.
[97:41.56]Because I only have one thing to do.
[97:44.07]I have... The job that I have is... Steal the painting in... 110.
[97:53.61]And it's 50 bucks.
[97:56.10]I don't have any other jobs to do.
[97:59.96]I already took the loot there.
[98:00.70]I need to, like, case the places out, man.
[98:02.38]Let's go.
[98:02.92]Okay, 110.
[98:03.40]That's where I'm supposed... Let's go.
[98:09.67]That's my very kind of cheese.
[98:12.17]Um... I'm a big Swiss cheese kind of fan, but... You know, Havarti's really good.
[98:23.74]Why am I answering this question?
[98:25.77]What?
[98:25.93]What?
[98:42.78]Yeah, no, Swiss cheese is great.
[98:43.84]Alright, I just gotta break or steal the painting over here at 110.
[98:49.45]And then I'll probably get more tasks.
[98:50.77]Alright, break or steal the painting.
[99:00.98]The people are probably home right now because it is 9.30pm.
[99:04.46]I don't see anybody in this room standing.
[99:11.20]Oh, forget about the flashlight.
[99:12.34]Dude, can I just, like, learn how to climb the fence?
[99:21.49]I need to learn how to climb a fence.
[99:33.41]Because I... Alright, we're going to the front door.
[99:41.12]Is anybody here?
[99:53.89]Just break it.
[99:54.39]Alright, I did it.
[100:06.08]They're not even home.
[100:07.98]Oh, got it.
[100:09.86]Okay.
[100:10.04]Okay.
[100:14.11]That was an original?
[100:14.97]Yeah, but they shouldn't have had it displayed in the window.
[100:23.02]Why on Earth would you display like a fucking million dollar painting right in the window?
[100:30.16]And you have single pane windows.
[100:39.51]So people can see.
[100:47.32]Alright, do I have anything to sell besides that?
[100:54.14]They can't afford any more window panes, because they already bought the painting.
[101:02.76]I have no items.
[101:03.48]Alright, is there anything else for me to take from the... home?
[101:18.55]It was actually only a $50 painting, so that doesn't even make any sense.
[101:21.65]But, I mean, come on, if you, okay, if you had, like, an original Mona Lisa, if you had the Mona Lisa, and you lived in a single-level one-bedroom with, like, ten windows, and you had it on your wall, like, somebody is going to smash your window and take it.
[101:38.38]They just will.
[101:40.91]You need to have, like, Home Alone-style booby traps everywhere.
[101:51.72]Well, thanks for giving me more of your routine.
[101:56.18]You wouldn't be living in that house if you had the Mona Lisa.
[101:59.77]Yeah, you know, that's 100% true.
[102:01.19]You have, like, a $50 million painting, and you're in, like, a one-bedroom in, like, a suburb somewhere.
[102:12.87]I'm obsessed with these houses.
[102:19.25]I gotta get over these houses.
[102:29.01]I just need to start taking stuff.
[102:30.55]What about 103 and 102?
[102:32.57]I just need money.
[102:35.25]I just need experience.
[102:47.54]Does it learn to climb?
[102:49.82]I have to do this before I get experience to learn to climb.
[102:55.29]Okay.
[102:56.17]So we got...
[103:00.56]This looks very elaborate.
[103:02.06]Electronic door.
[103:04.36]Lights are on.
[103:07.12]Somebody's listening to music.
[103:16.07]Anybody behind here?
[103:16.97]No, they're not having like a backyard barbecue.
[103:25.17]That's perfect for me to take whatever I want.
[103:29.96]You don't have anything back here at all?
[103:32.28]Nothing.
[103:33.90]Shit.
[103:40.97]Damn it.
[103:46.03]Do I have to, like, break in the front door right now?
[103:48.19]I can't even do that.
[103:53.33]And I don't have a doorbell.
[103:55.07]Well, this house is secure.
[103:58.09]Mona Lisa would do very well in there.
[104:00.03]There's a person coming right now.
[104:05.05]I don't think anybody's at home.
[104:20.12]101.
[104:22.44]How's 101?
[104:24.88]Security cameras.
[104:29.40]They got the whole thing set up here.
[104:30.86]There's security here, pointing this way.
[104:34.52]Camera's in the front of the house.
[104:41.85]Alright.
[104:43.29]Anybody in there?
[104:43.99]You know what's just happening?
[104:52.44]Trash I can take and sell.
[104:58.91]Now you get on top of this.
[105:00.57]Lockpicking level 3.
[105:01.19]Alright, we have to go back to the other houses.
[105:05.69]It's like 110.
[105:07.97]I have to rob the same guy over and over again.
[105:12.97]Or this one would open.
[105:13.73]That's so sad.
[105:17.39]I have to rob the same person?
[105:18.91]Okay, I don't know where they are now.
[105:23.01]But it is 2 AM.
[105:24.57]They're probably asleep.
[105:29.60]This guy's gonna walk right by.
[105:30.76]This many pedestrians outside at 2 o'clock in the morning is just... No.
[105:38.54]Where the hell do we live?
[105:41.27]People just taking strolls at 2 a.m.
[105:43.21]Alright, please don't come down and get like a glass of milk.
[106:08.36]Okay.
[106:09.26]Shh.
[106:12.29]50 bucks.
[106:16.13]I hope they don't wake up.
[106:16.95]It's 3 o'clock in the morning.
[106:18.09]Who's gonna wake up right now?
[106:19.05]$15.
[106:26.66]Alright.
[106:26.86]Oh, slowly.
[106:30.02]Slowly.
[106:37.46]Slowly.
[106:38.34]Ugh.
[106:40.72]Whatever.
[106:40.90]They're not gonna fucking hear it.
[106:41.92]They're in their bed.
[106:45.66]Nothing up here anyways.
[106:46.60]Alright.
[106:48.35]No money.
[106:50.55]Is there another safe?
[106:51.39]It is.
[106:54.51]Plenty of... What?
[107:01.87]Somebody in a basement?
[107:03.23]Underground?
[107:06.80]Oh, fuck.
[107:16.55]I can't fit in there!
[107:17.29]This is- Oh yeah, I get it.
[107:18.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[107:20.61]I'm gonna pee.
[107:21.21]I gotta pee my- Ooh, that's a camera.
[107:26.53]And we got a damaged U-phone.
[107:28.30]Someone's looking for that.
[107:37.14]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[107:37.92]I don't know why I have to pee so bad.
[107:41.53]Why?
[107:44.59]I don't know.
[107:45.40]When I walked in here, I got nervous and I just had to pee.
[107:49.58]I'm like a small dog.
[107:50.74]What's in there?
[107:57.43]Silverware.
[108:00.79]4 a.m.
[108:01.29]I gotta get out of here by like 6.
[108:09.30]No, turn the light off.
[108:10.48]Easy.
[108:20.83]Alright, it's time to go.
[108:22.55]I gotta get out of here.
[108:24.92]Okay.
[108:26.12]A Huey?
[108:27.90]What is a Huey?
[108:36.48]Did you hear a door?
[108:38.00]What was the door?
[108:39.12]I heard a door.
[108:39.52]5 AM.
[108:46.02]5 AM.
[108:46.16]Out.
[108:58.04]See ya!
[109:06.93]Okay, let's sell this stuff.
[109:11.33]There was something that, on that black market, somebody wanted one of these things.
[109:17.63]That's like an A. Alright, so there's another level up.
[109:23.39]That the skill point is available.
[109:24.71]Let's take a look.
[109:26.64]So, I'm level 5.
[109:28.42]I can't even buy this.
[109:31.32]I can do this.
[109:32.60]Appraise more items on the spot.
[109:38.00]This is the only thing I can do.
[109:39.98]So I have better appraisal skills.
[109:45.75]I need to do more.
[109:46.57]I need to steal more shit.
[109:51.17]Alright, what did somebody want here?
[109:52.29]Not big.
[109:57.19]I don't have any of that.
[109:58.13]Car parts.
[109:58.83]Electronics.
[110:00.35]Somebody wanted a damaged U-phone.
[110:02.63]Sure.
[110:04.41]Router.
[110:05.05]Radio.
[110:06.15]Kitchen.
[110:06.75]Other.
[110:07.21]Antiques.
[110:08.87]What was it?
[110:09.19]What did I pick up?
[110:09.87]I picked something up.
[110:12.12]Oh, here we go.
[110:12.80]Break or steal the pear decoration.
[110:15.76]At $113.00.
[110:21.44]Easy enough.
[110:23.63]Alright, I'm gonna sleep.
[110:24.95]I'm gonna pee my pants, so I'll be right back.
[110:27.34]See you guys in like two minutes.
[112:44.26]alright so what do you say but yeah I uh I mean I make sure that I have none of my stuff like in any windows like none of any literally all the stuff that I own I make sure I make sure to just completely protect myself everything I own is underneath my bed every painting all my game consoles um all the money that I own is just I just put it under my bed
[113:14.85]So I have like a house worth of shit under my bed.
[113:23.07]So people will look through the windows, they're like, well this guy is like fucking nothing.
[113:25.78]But literally they realize.
[113:29.12]I have a vintage motorcycle.
[113:32.34]Under my bed.
[113:38.75]I've got every DVD of Spongebob.
[113:41.45]Under the bed.
[113:48.17]See, what I do is I take the SpongeBob boxes, and I leave the boxes out right in the open, like, holy shit, boy, he's got all the SpongeBob.
[113:55.88]Hey, stupid idiot.
[113:57.45]I put the special features DVDs in there.
[114:00.43]The real ones are under the bed.
[114:16.17]Oh, now you're asking to get robbed.
[114:18.01]You got all the SpongeBob DVDs.
[114:19.77]Alright, what about this one?
[114:27.48]What about all the limited edition Happy Meal toys?
[114:31.06]Um, they're all under there too.
[114:33.88]Guys, I have a quadruple king.
[114:36.52]The bed is the floor.
[114:38.73]I had it specially built.
[114:41.34]You know when you open up somebody's bedroom and there's, oh, there's carpet and there's the bed and... No, no, no.
[114:45.61]You open up the door to my bedroom and the ground is a king-size bed.
[114:49.73]The ground is a bed.
[114:52.55]You have to, like, open and it's, like, made out of a special foam where there's enough for the door to open and then you just kind of climb on.
[115:04.06]It's possible to climb the second floor.
[115:05.70]Alright, I want a possible loot location on 104.
[115:07.74]Because that's the one I can get into, right?
[115:15.58]It's no wonder it took you six weeks to move here.
[115:17.60]I mean, it was an incredibly elaborate project.
[115:21.36]It's like $445,000.
[115:22.32]And it was weird because the whole time that the workers were making it, they were like laughing.
[115:32.80]But the door would be closed and I would just hear them fucking hysterically laughing while they were doing it.
[115:38.66]And I would just pop in like, you know, hey boys, like, boys, what's going on in here?
[115:43.06]And they'd stop laughing and be like, nothing, we're just like working.
[115:46.08]Be like, okay, okay.
[115:48.74]And I'd close the door and like after like five minutes I'd hear them laughing again.
[115:51.42]It was really, really angering me.
[115:52.82]Alright, there's a pricey guitar in the garage.
[116:06.11]They were watching the DVDs.
[116:09.57]Yeah, it was weird.
[116:10.13]Like, I kept hearing, like, really, really memorable funny SpongeBob quotes from inside the room.
[116:17.40]I was under the impression that one of them could just do a really good SpongeBob.
[116:19.96]I was like, wow, one of them in there can do a fucking great SpongeBob and a Squidward, too.
[116:24.92]They're, like, having a blast.
[116:29.41]Alright, if I got the money, I might as well spend it.
[116:31.03]Let's learn everything about 104.
[116:35.10]So, pricey guitar in the garage.
[116:36.94]You can climb the second floor of Vines.
[116:38.98]And there's only one person there between 8 and 7 p.m.
[116:42.28]So let's go.
[116:42.78]8 a.m.
[116:44.15]Go.
[116:46.45]And that, what was, which one was that?
[116:53.11]This is 106.
[116:53.45]Wait, no, 104. 104.
[117:04.18]So what time is it?
[117:04.78]Between 8 and 6?
[117:05.60]Is that 8 p.m.
[117:09.26]or a.m.?
[117:11.72]So... This person is out here from 8 a.m.
[117:16.35]104.
[117:17.13]I don't have anything else to sell, I don't think.
[117:35.13]The Jared Leto Joker laugh and the Squidward laugh are the same laugh.
[117:41.90]Are they?
[117:42.26]Hold on.
[117:50.61]Fuck, you're right.
[117:51.51]Wow.
[117:53.45]It's the same thing.
[117:54.33]They're the same laugh.
[117:57.02]You're absolutely correct.
[118:07.19]Alright, 104.
[118:07.69]We got all the intel.
[118:09.71]Between 8 AM... Let's just sleep in the fucking car.
[118:13.33]I screwed it up.
[118:14.19]8 AM.
[118:21.94]I bet you 100% Jerma has done a Joker cosplay.
[118:26.60]I have not.
[118:27.12]I have not done a Joker cosplay.
[118:31.63]Alright, sleep in the car until 8 o'clock in the morning.
[118:35.72]Well, 7 a.m.
[118:36.44]to get myself some time.
[118:42.87]Alright.
[118:44.55]Run.
[118:47.37]Another way.
[118:55.49]Alright.
[118:55.71]There's supposed to be one person in here at 8 a.m.
[118:59.44]Alright.
[119:01.26]So the bedroom is downstairs.
[119:02.46]That's really good to know.
[119:07.57]Crouching in a weird place.
[119:10.10]Alright, we're fine.
[119:13.04]Crouching in a weird place.
[119:15.64]So I need 104.
[119:17.96]Which is this one.
[119:21.30]I don't think I can get in here though.
[119:24.24]Is this the one that I couldn't get in?
[119:27.74]It's not.
[119:28.32]Alright, wait.
[119:29.54]We're going to wait until the person... Fucking god damn it.
[119:33.01]I don't think I can do anything here.
[119:35.13]I can't climb these.
[119:38.68]Nope.
[119:39.24]I don't have agility 2.
[119:41.61]But I can get into the back door.
[119:45.25]Gonna wait for that person to leave in 10 seconds.
[119:49.37]Alright, here they go.
[119:53.28]8 AM.
[119:55.30]Which way do you go?
[119:58.48]You go out this way, it seems.
[120:00.16]No, you're just gonna circle around.
[120:02.05]Out the front door.
[120:12.08]That guy just walked around in a circle three times.
[120:14.04]Okay, so there's somebody sleeping down there.
[120:16.08]And they're the only one here.
[120:20.33]What?
[120:20.61]What?
[120:20.95]What?
[120:21.23]Put it down.
[120:21.59]Put it down.
[120:22.05]Put it down.
[120:23.11]Who?
[120:24.71]Put it down.
[120:26.49]Put it down.
[120:27.31]I can't put it down.
[120:30.13]Lock.
[120:30.57]Exit.
[120:30.93]E. Oh, my God.
[120:34.62]No.
[120:37.48]I gotta... I gotta go.
[120:40.88]What is this?
[121:05.24]That cop has a shitload of food in his mouth.
[121:08.48]He got the call.
[121:09.07]He was right there.
[121:09.61]He's in the middle of his lunch break.
[121:11.95]He's sitting there, like, eating a delicious fucking turkey club.
[121:14.35]Then all of a sudden, he gets, like, the call.
[121:15.77]Oh, shit!
[121:17.19]Like... Alright, this is fine.
[121:31.22]Alright, let's try this again.
[121:35.24]Between 8 a.m.
[121:39.59]and 9 p.m.
[121:42.35]Fuck it, I'm just getting in there now.
[121:49.74]Because he's going to walk around in a circle.
[121:51.10]There's people right here.
[121:52.02]Yeah, just, I'm getting in there now.
[121:53.00]I'm going now.
[121:53.72]Get in there now.
[121:58.51]There's a person right there.
[122:00.43]God damn it.
[122:01.11]Come on.
[122:03.94]Try driving through the garage first.
[122:06.72]The garage is right above this lady.
[122:10.54]Hold on.
[122:10.80]I gotta wait for this person to go.
[122:15.73]Multiple people.
[122:17.89]Who needs a neighborhood watch when there's eyeballs on every single street at all times?
[122:27.51]The neighborhood watch is just a connected group of people computers.
[122:31.21]What do you want?
[122:32.77]What's wrong?
[122:34.46]What is wrong with this?
[122:35.72]I'm just, like, I'm doing the same thing you're doing.
[122:42.62]Alright.
[122:44.26]Can I get a second here?
[122:46.42]He's gone.
[122:47.10]She's awake.
[122:48.63]She's going back to bed.
[122:54.05]That's what a neighborhood watch is.
[122:58.36]Am I ever going to be able to do this?
[123:06.41]She's still... This is the perfect opportunity to go, but I can't until this person is going to turn the other way.
[123:12.37]You're walking up here.
[123:15.24]No.
[123:16.50]I'll have an opportunity right now.
[123:18.04]No.
[123:19.64]Okay.
[123:21.16]Okay.
[123:26.93]Um... Okay, right now.
[123:35.75]Okay, I don't... This is... This is that board game, Don't Wake Daddy.
[123:48.14]Somebody has an open window.
[123:58.30]This is not even the right house.
[124:01.34]This is somebody else's house.
[124:05.09]Uh, okay.
[124:08.29]I don't know where they are, though.
[124:09.19]They might be here.
[124:09.73]This is the guy's office.
[124:12.23]Nice painting.
[124:22.77]I don't see anybody.
[124:41.95]I need intel on this.
[124:43.61]He might be in the other room.
[124:46.19]He might be in this room.
[124:51.68]What if he's in here?
[124:52.30]Oh!
[125:19.47]Oh, come on.
[125:19.89]You don't have anything?
[125:21.13]Turn these off.
[125:22.07]No.
[125:30.30]I thought that was a per- That door's open.
[125:31.98]Somebody's here.
[125:38.45]Somebody's in the house.
[125:47.70]Expensive, uh, expensive toilet in here, right?
[125:51.24]Expensive guitar?
[125:52.19]No, that's the wrong thing.
[126:02.11]They're definitely home... later tonight.
[126:24.72]Oh, fuck.
[126:31.36]Got it.
[126:32.86]I got the routine.
[126:34.38]Um... He's gonna be home.
[126:45.01]Wah!
[126:50.05]Imagine seeing that.
[126:52.41]Oh, that's a pants shit moment.
[126:56.02]You just peek around the corner, you make direct eye contact.
[127:01.85]I need to get to the other house.
[127:02.95]Is she downstairs?
[127:12.75]Uh-oh.
[127:15.59]Can I hide in the bathtub?
[127:16.59]Hide?
[127:16.85]Where can I hide?
[127:19.58]That is a nice toilet.
[127:21.30]The husband's gonna be home.
[127:24.70]I'm in deep shit right now.
[127:43.53]What would you even think?
[127:47.61]If... If you got home, and you didn't notice anything strange, the only thing that was weird about your house was your toilet was in a hundred pieces.
[128:02.82]You'd just be like, I don't even know what happened here.
[128:06.54]Like, honey, do you know what happened to the toilet?
[128:09.93]What was that?
[128:10.31]It's like a golden goblet.
[128:12.21]Oh my god.
[128:15.64]Give me the remote.
[128:16.32]I got a golden goblet.
[128:18.00]It's time to go.
[128:19.82]I got the ultimate bonus.
[128:20.76]I don't even care about the TV.
[128:25.91]Okay.
[128:26.53]I got time to go.
[128:31.52]Where's my exit?
[128:33.18]Husband's home.
[128:49.63]Oh, there's a safe.
[128:51.33]Shit.
[128:56.27]I can't.
[128:59.95]I don't have any more room.
[129:04.57]I gotta get out.
[129:05.17]Out.
[129:06.09]I have the golden goblet.
[129:08.23]What more do I want?
[129:21.25]Painting?
[129:22.65]I can't.
[129:23.87]I can't.
[129:38.78]I can't.
[129:41.74]Put it down.
[129:42.42]Put the painting down.
[129:44.30]I can't put the painting down.
[129:46.45]I can't put the painting down.
[129:48.99]Why?
[129:50.61]I can't put down the painting.
[129:53.79]I'm stuck in the wall.
[129:57.95]My sensitivity just went up by 1000%.
[130:01.03]Why?
[130:01.51]What the fuck?
[130:06.51]Why is my sensitivity at 5000 right now?
[130:09.45]What?
[130:15.00]That was bullshit.
[130:15.82]I couldn't put the painting down.
[130:19.47]I literally, the game broke.
[130:21.43]I could not put down the painting.
[130:22.51]And when I put the painting down, my sensitivity was a thousand.
[130:28.72]What the hell happened there?
[130:32.18]You weren't pressing E. I pressed E a hundred times.
[130:35.20]And my sensitivity still screwed up.
[130:42.23]What happened?
[130:46.99]You see this?
[130:48.65]Why is it so weird?
[130:49.41]Uh, that was total horseshit.
[131:08.49]I'm sitting there, I'm pressing every button.
[131:10.55]E, click, space.
[131:12.11]It's E, E, E. I picked it up with E.
[131:17.22]Something feels off.
[131:18.28]Like, really off.
[131:23.56]Even my mouse in the game.
[131:24.68]Oh, let me... I'm going to restart the game.
[131:29.39]Uh, is it saved, right?
[131:39.04]DPI?
[131:39.84]Well, I don't know why it just changed in this game.
[131:45.46]Did I panic hit my DPI?
[131:47.14]I don't have a button to do that.
[131:50.10]I'm just going to reload it.
[131:51.80]Yeah, very bad.
[131:57.36]Okay.
[132:02.95]DPI button on your mouse?
[132:05.11]Is that... No.
[132:09.43]I don't even have... I have two buttons on my mouse that don't do anything.
[132:19.84]Yeah, I do have a depth adder.
[132:20.86]I've been using it for almost three straight weeks and the buttons don't do anything.
[132:33.95]Let's see.
[132:39.59]Why couldn't I just put the fucking painting down?
[132:58.16]Why would I use a Death Adder in 2020?
[133:00.64]Uh... Because I have like big fucking hands.
[133:15.61]And every mouse I've ever owned that's not a Death Adder is too small for me.
[133:20.44]I swear to God, I'm not making that up.
[133:40.39]Yeah.
[133:41.45]Oh yeah, you guys are right!
[133:44.03]You guys are right!
[133:46.88]Watch this.
[133:51.04]Why is this on here?
[133:54.52]Let's put it all the way down.
[133:57.28]Back to where it was, where it belongs.
[134:00.06]Why would that be pre-programmed into the mouse?
[134:03.44]If you accidentally fucking press that button, your mouse just goes to shit.
[134:10.39]By default, that's on.
[134:12.65]What kind of fucking brainless shit is that?
[134:20.91]That wasn't on the original Death Adder.
[134:28.70]Every mouse has that?
[134:29.66]No, it doesn't?
[134:30.32]Why?
[134:31.86]I don't want that on here.
[134:32.82]I want that to be, like, eat.
[134:35.56]Or melee.
[134:41.97]Alright, let's see if I can actually not press a button and not be able to pick up a fucking painting.
[134:46.01]No, get off of this.
[135:08.13]I need to wait.
[135:10.74]I had it too, like I just... But that wasn't even the root of the... Oh my fucking god.
[135:31.07]That wasn't even the problem.
[135:33.25]Is E to pick up and E to put down.
[135:35.85]And I couldn't put it down.
[135:37.61]That wasn't even the problem.
[135:51.50]How do those buttons get pressed by accident?
[135:53.38]Because I'm trying to press every button.
[136:02.75]I just want the goblet.
[136:03.66]I already had the fucking goblet.
[136:06.72]Alright, I'm just going in and I'm smashing windows and taking it.
[136:31.39]Alright, what time is it?
[136:31.97]Alright, he's gone.
[136:34.37]That doesn't even matter.
[136:34.93]Not even the right.
[136:35.39]It's a different house.
[136:50.59]Alright.
[136:50.81]I don't care about the painting.
[136:52.51]I want the goblet.
[137:02.95]Press E to drop Goblin.
[137:11.59]Okay.
[137:12.39]I want to show you this.
[137:13.94]E. Here we go.
[137:16.12]E. It has to be... Why did it not work the first time?
[137:23.82]I pressed this a hundred times last time.
[137:26.16]I promise.
[137:30.06]You understand?
[137:31.04]Why does it work now?
[137:39.41]Need room to drop it.
[137:40.15]There was nothing else in the room when I was here last time.
[137:41.79]Alright, where's that goblet?
[137:58.03]Alright, just give me the fucking goblet.
[137:59.17]Give me this.
[137:59.53]Get me out of here.
[138:20.93]Alright, get the fuck out of here.
[138:32.51]Now get out of the- Get out of the window before I fucking freak out.
[138:54.29]Alright, we're good.
[138:58.34]I'm doing some suspicious walking.
[139:01.10]Didn't break the toilet!
[140:33.06]Fucking Razor Death Adder DPI bullshit.
[140:42.53]That just, you hit that person.
[140:57.45]It's a gamer button.
[140:58.19]You wouldn't understand.
[140:58.95]No.
[141:01.15]And don't, when I plug the mouse in, try to install your fucking, like, parasite software.
[141:06.88]That's another thing.
[141:16.36]66 bucks for this?
[141:26.42]That's it.
[141:26.80]That's all we got for that.
[141:28.34]Ooh, we got a lot of new quests.
[141:29.54]Alright, break.
[141:34.43]Are you ready for this?
[141:35.93]This is 104, 105, 106.
[141:37.17]We're gonna break a window, break their TV, break their sink.
[141:44.03]These are my kind of missions.
[141:47.85]104, break the fucking window.
[141:49.21]105, break this TV.
[141:51.63]106, break the sink.
[141:52.89]Back to it.
[141:53.31]Let's go.
[142:08.49]Who's the brainless guy that came up with that?
[142:15.53]I'm gonna rebind those to like a sound effect.
[142:17.45]Like a fucking fart sound.
[142:30.20]I'm home.
[142:30.74]Oh, what's this?
[142:38.68]What did I say I wanted to change it to?
[142:39.82]To eat?
[142:40.24]This is like total fucking rage coming out.
[142:45.15]I want to rebind it to eat!
[142:46.39]Okay, what was in here?
[142:54.13]What needs to be broken in here?
[142:56.55]104.
[142:57.97]Break a window.
[143:19.00]What else was it?
[143:22.84]Get out, quick!
[143:24.80]Oh, I'm stuck.
[143:25.84]No, get back in.
[143:37.05]Get in!
[143:44.55]They leave the window opened in the back.
[143:51.43]What?
[144:03.01]That was house 106.
[144:07.99]This game is fucking funny.
[144:15.95]This just put me here.
[144:16.67]I didn't do it.
[144:17.21]Alright, so 106.
[144:17.65]Which one's the sink?
[144:22.69]106 is break the sink.
[144:26.09]And then break... Okay, 106, break sink, break TV, break window.
[144:40.23]Uh, yes, excuse me, ma'am?
[144:41.39]Could you please come to the door?
[144:54.78]Where's your sink?
[145:30.72]He just did the thing when you walk by a public bathroom stall.
[145:34.80]And you like see the guy and he sees you and it's like, oh fuck!
[145:53.51]Okay, the police are gonna tow my car.
[145:56.69]Oh shit, the police are gonna tow the car?
[145:59.96]Break TV.
[146:00.32]Are they coming back?
[146:06.97]Are they coming to tow the car?
[146:10.13]Do I fail the mission if they do that?
[146:17.84]The police are going to tow the car.
[146:28.14]No, don't tow the car.
[146:29.04]I'm up, I'm just, I'm coming out right now.
[146:41.24]Get the fuck out of the way.
[147:04.44]I didn't even touch that guy.
[147:07.14]Okay, well, so, get in the car.
[147:11.98]Just pull it over here.
[147:13.94]106, sink.
[147:28.94]105, TV.
[147:29.10]104, window.
[147:35.23]I need to do that one last, because that's going to cause an alarm.
[147:39.07]So.
[147:40.85]We've got 106.
[147:41.27]I don't know if anybody's here or not, but the doorbell seemed to work pretty well.
[148:03.27]Oh, get fucking out of here.
[148:09.82]Alright.
[148:11.32]Sink.
[148:28.60]Oh, that hurt.
[148:37.38]I have to pick the lock from the ins- Can I ring the doorbell from out here?
[148:40.82]Oh, come on.
[148:53.73]Jump out the- I know, I know, but like, but hold on.
[148:55.93]I'm panicking.
[148:56.71]I'm panicking.
[149:04.39]But isn't she in this room?
[149:05.43]She's in this room right now.
[149:19.19]I told you!
[149:19.89]I told you she was in the room!
[149:28.33]She's not gonna come in here, right?
[149:29.29]What was that?
[150:13.16]What room is she in?
[150:14.20]Where is she?
[150:14.52]I don't know where she is.
[150:15.12]I heard her.
[150:18.52]This is open.
[150:19.32]But is she right here?
[150:19.93]I think she's right here.
[150:22.61]I don't know where the fuck she is.
[150:29.71]She's in this room.
[150:33.29]I hear the footsteps.
[150:34.53]It's driving me crazy.
[150:39.09]Oh, shit.
[150:39.53]The husband.
[150:44.21]It was the husband.
[150:45.41]Alright.
[150:45.91]We take what we can get here.
[150:46.70]Come on.
[150:52.79]Oh shit, that was a bad move.
[150:54.54]No, no, no, that's okay, that's okay.
[150:57.18]Where are they gonna go?
[150:58.04]Inside this room?
[150:58.72]Oh, I'm so fucked right now.
[151:10.67]Hide in- hide- get- hu- uh.
[151:19.13]So this is very hard without knowing when the husband's gonna come home.
[151:32.32]Unlock all the doors for- I like need the other tools.
[151:38.11]I need like the other lockpicks.
[151:40.57]I need like the electrical kits.
[151:47.61]You could have just opened that other window to leave.
[151:52.55]Could I have, though?
[151:59.05]Who locks individual doors to their house?
[152:00.95]I don't know.
[152:01.97]Why do you have locks on every door?
[152:04.45]If I had a person in the house, I like...
[152:19.67]Tenant call the player.
[152:20.43]We got two of them done.
[152:22.41]The only other thing is to break the guy's TV in, uh, where is it, 105.
[152:26.57]But I know nothing about these people.
[152:29.19]This is gonna be impossible without knowing that.
[152:34.64]Didn't get the sink?
[152:35.56]Yeah, I did.
[152:38.74]How did I not get the sink?
[152:42.18]Was it the wrong house?
[152:45.46]I broke the wrong sink.
[152:55.38]kitchen sink?
[153:01.59]What you broke wasn't a sink.
[153:03.67]Hold on.
[153:05.29]That was very clearly a sink.
[153:08.89]That was a sink.
[153:09.97]I don't have to get the kitchen sink.
[153:15.96]Is it a bidet?
[153:16.98]I don't think I can leave.
[153:20.02]I'm stuck here forever.
[153:27.10]No, it is the Bright House!
[153:31.88]So I have to run up and smash the sink upstairs?
[153:37.62]What the fuck?
[153:50.03]Oh, he's using the toilet.
[154:04.16]So you tell me this wasn't a sink in here.
[154:06.42]I'm not breaking the toilet.
[154:09.44]The police AI is stuck here.
[154:16.65]It's already open.
[154:28.25]What is going to happen?
[154:28.83]Is it going to close?
[154:31.37]I got it.
[154:51.78]What's she sitting on?
[154:52.72]Okay, sink.
[154:54.96]Oh my fucking god.
[154:56.93]You guys weren't kidding.
[154:59.63]How do you break the sink?
[155:11.89]That was the same one that was downstairs.
[155:13.99]That was the same sink.
[155:16.29]Give me a break.
[155:17.99]How was I supposed to know that?
[155:25.15]Where are these police?
[155:32.78]Can I please get out of here?
[155:34.02]I have three stars.
[155:48.95]What the fuck?
[155:53.69]I broke a window and you're gonna get a helicopter in here?
[155:58.02]Why is there a chopper?
[155:59.24]I smashed a window.
[156:08.86]I did the equivalent of like two kids playing baseball.
[156:12.90]I don't think I can get out of here.
[156:15.12]I think I'm screwed.
[156:30.75]I wonder... See, this window's locked.
[156:38.67]I can't open it.
[156:40.87]I can't open this fucking window.
[156:42.69]Ugh!
[156:50.53]Seen by a tenant.
[156:52.60]The chopper's right here!
[156:53.66]How am I supposed to get out of here?
[157:15.62]I'm gonna break a TV.
[157:16.56]I'm just gonna break a TV.
[157:23.45]Where's the TV?
[157:28.87]Okay, this is like, this is getting a little out of hand.
[157:39.51]Wait this out.
[157:40.47]I can't wait this out.
[157:41.69]This is 104?
[157:43.80]What do I need to do in 1.04?
[157:45.06]1.05... I'm done.
[157:50.80]I'm getting out of here.
[157:51.48]Uh-oh!
[157:57.61]Uh-oh, wait.
[157:59.77]No!
[158:00.15]Freeze!
[158:05.33]Just give me a mission to do.
[158:07.11]I just need to level up to 6 and then we can keep going.
[158:10.91]I'm not leveled up enough.
[158:18.02]Am I level 6 yet?
[158:19.92]Can I climb fences now?
[158:28.94]Oh, thank God.
[158:31.80]Okay, we can continue with the tutorial.
[158:38.99]Agility 2, I got it.
[158:48.33]Um... Is there a reason why we're not going on here?
[159:00.66]Fucking dinky-eyed cynics!
[159:06.15]I'm just gonna go home.
[159:19.36]Windows 98.
[159:24.06]No, every time you make me do this, man, I fuck it all up.
[159:30.47]And then I get angry at my muffs.
[159:32.71]Whoa!
[159:39.99]I won't buy this.
[159:40.81]Wipe it and we'll talk.
[159:41.80]Oh, never mind.
[159:57.89]Hey, go smash somebody's windshield at 104.
[160:00.73]You know you've been there like a thousand times.
[160:03.55]You keep breaking shit and keep getting arrested, and then you progressively get more frustrated at yourself and at the game, and then you start blaming your hardware.
[160:25.91]Alright, so climbing gloves.
[160:27.95]Why would you need to climb- $1200!
[160:29.59]Hopefully that was a good- that was not a mistake, I hope.
[160:40.30]Break a car window in 1.04.
[160:57.61]The gloves cost more than the car.
[161:04.11]Alright, break a car window at 104.
[161:05.27]You got it.
[161:06.78]It's gonna take two seconds, right?
[161:20.44]Well, I can climb.
[161:33.05]Break a window?
[161:34.23]Break a car!
[161:44.03]So I'm gonna break the car window, and I'm gonna break a window and get out of here.
[161:53.78]He's not home, so I need to get down to the garage and break the window in the garage.
[162:02.51]I can't carry this.
[162:03.37]Put it down.
[162:09.80]What else is in here?
[162:10.38]I've got, like, an opportunity.
[162:11.32]Might as well take it for a second.
[162:12.44]Okay, he's gonna be back very soon.
[162:20.93]So, we need to get to garage.
[162:22.39]Car.
[162:22.75]Here we go.
[162:23.89]So, I need... Inventory is full.
[162:32.90]Can I throw shit away?
[162:38.16]Fuck the radio, give me the guitar.
[162:39.42]Okay, break a window.
[162:42.54]Can I open this garage?
[162:44.78]Okay, here we go.
[162:45.48]Oh no!
[162:56.14]Oh no!
[163:40.42]Get it open!
[163:43.42]Holy shit!
[163:44.94]What was the thing that he wasn't even on the screen?
[163:46.60]He wasn't even on the mini-map.
[163:47.42]What?
[163:49.12]He wasn't even on the mini-map.
[163:54.85]What the hell?
[164:00.11]He wasn't on the... And he had a key.
[164:16.19]I would have got out.
[164:16.83]That would have been... I would have made it.
[164:29.26]I can only climb the fence in certain places.
[164:33.32]None of which are here.
[164:35.84]I have to climb up there and go down.
[164:41.52]Why am I doing this during the day?
[164:42.62]Because the husband is not there during the day.
[164:50.92]Unlock it before you start.
[164:52.70]Car parked in a strange place.
[164:54.02]Hold on.
[164:54.40]Come on.
[165:00.86]I don't know if I'm going to accidentally hit somebody.
[165:06.97]The police are going to tell the car, come on.
[165:11.61]I might as well just, like, restart it.
[165:12.91]Oh, God.
[165:34.34]Triple parked.
[165:35.50]Ugh.
[165:37.62]I would have got out of there, too.
[165:38.73]What?
[165:39.11]That...
[165:46.69]Alright, so I'm gonna open up all the doors before I do anything.
[165:49.95]I guess I know.
[165:58.90]How strange.
[166:13.28]Alright, what time is it?
[166:14.62]Four.
[166:14.90]I'm gonna sleep until 8am.
[166:19.18]Because that's when he leaves and I have all the time I need.
[166:21.52]Alright, 8am.
[166:36.56]So, she's sleeping.
[166:38.12]This person right here.
[166:39.68]I'm gonna unlock...
[166:42.11]all these doors before I do this.
[166:46.11]I'm going to unlock this one.
[166:49.57]And then I can get... Let's see.
[166:50.85]Make sure I can get out of that one.
[166:51.81]Do I have enough time to do this?
[167:00.91]Somebody's walking on the other side here, right?
[167:02.57]I don't think I have enough time.
[167:05.05]I have to wait.
[167:08.14]I'll do this one first.
[167:10.35]Because there ain't nobody looking over here, right?
[167:32.33]Okay, this one is open.
[167:37.02]Open.
[167:44.31]Okay, thank god that doesn't fall damage.
[167:45.61]Alright.
[167:45.83]Do I have an opportunity to do this now?
[167:54.89]Not quite.
[167:59.11]Put on the pink pantheon music?
[168:11.14]Alright.
[168:15.72]I'm gonna get it, like, hold on.
[168:16.78]Let me, like, get it queued up so I can have it.
[168:32.61]Alright, it's loading.
[168:33.57]Oh, whatever.
[168:50.44]This is going to distract me.
[168:51.54]Here we go.
[170:30.69]Get out of the way!
[170:31.77]Why is it always somebody here?
[171:00.10]so so
[171:31.51]No, no, no!
[171:32.97]No, I went the wrong way!
[171:36.56]No, shit!
[171:37.68]I thought there was... No, it's okay.
[171:50.09]That's the wrong way.
[171:50.75]No, I can go.
[171:51.37]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[171:58.35]What is playing right now?
[172:08.67]I turned the wrong direction.
[172:10.69]I'm gonna have a meltdown meltdown This is auto playing I think I crashed the game I did
[172:59.57]Open the game again.
[173:12.87]I like went down too far.
[173:14.37]Distracting myself with fucking music blasting in my ear.
[173:31.85]trying to like play the game to the music like just fucking do it why would I do that?
[173:41.92]there's literally no reason to do that I can't think of one single reason why you would play that song and try to do it it's difficult to do you know it's like crap man
[174:00.61]Did it crash again?
[174:01.87]No, we're fine.
[174:06.79]Uh, maybe we're not.
[174:09.35]Alright, yeah, like, I mean, like, what the hell would I possibly be thinking?
[174:14.12]You know what I'm saying?
[174:15.10]Like, why would I do something like that?
[174:16.68]That was just stupid. ...
[175:32.51]Thank you.
[176:30.17]Okay.
[176:32.56]Here we go.
[176:34.12]Wait.
[176:38.35]What?
[176:40.29]Wait.
[176:41.01]Oh, I'm freaking myself.

[176:56.83]Okay, I'm fine.
[176:57.55]I'm fine.
[176:58.53]Okay, we're fine.
[177:00.40]We did it!
[177:06.04]What is auto-playing?
[177:11.39]What is auto-playing?
[177:25.60]It's playing the Freddy Krueger theme song.
[177:32.64]No, it's not.
[177:44.17]Where did Trump come from?
[177:50.87]Alright, should I just keep autoplay on the whole stream?
[177:52.93]What do you think?
[177:58.86]What's gonna happen?
[178:04.21]At least for, like, the next few minutes.
[178:05.55]Oh, come on.
[178:07.69]A D with a 5 stealth XP bonus.
[178:11.07]I can't handle it, man.

[178:37.12]Donald Trump shit.

[178:52.37]Okay.
[178:54.05]So, I just need to... I need to sell.

[182:02.07]The thing that's coming up here in a second.
[182:09.47]Oh no, no, it's not.
[182:10.31]Oh wait, what is this?
[182:12.49]I just saw like the guy like, we need your help.
[182:14.45]Whatever his name is.
[182:15.37]And he was like, one of your ears up there.
[182:26.58]Okay.
[182:27.32]So I'm going to break into... Let's go to 1-0.

[183:20.96]Nothing.
[183:21.82]Is this a test?
[183:22.80]No.
[183:23.58]Okay, hold on.
[183:24.72]This feels like a test.
[183:27.02]Keep autoplay.
[183:28.06]Autoplay is on.
[183:28.72]I just skipped the track.
[183:30.30]This is Nintendo Mi theme.

[184:40.23]What?
[184:40.55]Can somebody see?
[184:43.33]How do I get in their house?
[185:14.52]Alright, I'm gonna turn it off.
[185:22.58]No, what do you mean no?
[185:29.26]I can't stand it anymore.
[185:30.70]I have to turn it off.
[185:35.29]I have to turn this off.
[185:36.97]E?
[185:38.33]I got an E?
[185:39.63]What is E?
[185:44.09]What is an E?
[185:49.00]That's gonna make me lose my mind.
[185:56.32]I'm losing my mind.
[186:01.29]Hell, is this like 40 minutes?
[186:07.41]Do I- can I level up?
[186:08.79]I can level up.
[186:10.61]I think this might be like a 4 hour remix.
[186:13.70]Oh, hold on.
[186:14.00]I'm getting lightheaded.
[186:14.72]I gotta stop.
[186:18.31]Okay.
[186:19.91]I need lockpicking three.
[186:26.45]Vinny, what do you have to say?
[186:27.49]Greenview 108 spends way too much time in front of the TV.
[186:32.27]Be a good neighbor and help him out.
[186:44.81]Where are you gonna steal a big TV?
[186:48.33]Wait, I need like the device.

[187:03.64]Why would I be listening to this?
[187:06.62]No, it's gonna play like a League of Legends remix.
[187:12.21]I don't know what the next thing is.
[187:15.03]Alright, do I need a new thing?
[187:20.32]I don't have enough money for the lockpick.
[187:31.44]Alright, this is just like Beethoven.
[187:44.76]I think I need to make more money.
[188:18.18]I hate this.
[188:32.81]No, I have to turn it off.
[188:34.13]I can't stand it.
[188:35.95]I can't stand it.
[188:37.53]What do I need to do?
[188:39.77]Break the TV.
[188:40.86]It's 500 bucks.
[188:41.44]Just open the fucking door.

[191:25.21]Where's the TV?
[191:50.97]That's not a big TV!
[191:59.53]Freeze!
[192:00.67]What?
[192:00.95]The cop is in the house?
[192:03.11]Get off.
[192:03.95]Turn it off.
[192:05.25]I'm done.
[192:05.59]Turn it off.
[192:13.00]I'm done.
[192:13.34]My overstimulation is over.
[192:34.85]I hate this.
[192:38.85]Okay.
[192:40.91]So.
[192:42.57]I need to get.
[192:43.24]I could have just gone up there.
[192:54.81]I'm so.
[192:55.87]I'm so sorry.
[192:59.39]I couldn't stop it.
[193:02.15]I just had to go for at least a few minutes.
[193:04.84]I'm just very... I'm going to apologize for that over and over again.
[193:08.82]I'm going to park and I'm going to sleep and I'm going to steal their TV.
[193:17.22]The remixes.
[193:20.16]Oh, I'm going to throw up.
[193:28.85]There's a remix for every single thing.
[193:32.27]I gotta turn this down, though.
[193:33.79]This is not allowed.
[193:34.61]It is absolute hell.
[193:41.98]Alright, let's wait until they're asleep.
[193:58.85]I don't even know why that happened.
[193:59.97]Oh, because we played the Pink Panther music.
[194:06.33]Alright, I need to see when they're home, they're asleep, what room they're in.
[194:10.13]The lights are on in here.
[194:12.45]TV's in that room.
[194:13.63]I could break it and get out.
[194:16.01]Or I could take it.
[194:16.95]Can I fit it out that window?
[194:21.26]It's possible that I could even fit it through the window.
[194:24.26]No, definitely not.
[194:25.02]I have to just break it.
[194:25.72]I'm going to put it in a different room and break it.
[194:28.28]Somebody in that one.
[194:29.00]I can't even open this door.
[194:35.15]Come on.
[194:35.55]I can't even open that door.
[194:36.70]I need a level 3 pick.
[194:37.66]I don't have one.
[194:38.16]Alright.
[194:39.78]We're just going to steal stuff.
[194:43.26]Try to get some expensive stuff.
[194:48.84]Arrow in the Knee Dubstep Remix.
[194:52.92]Oh, that was a sought-after item.
[194:54.08]Router.
[194:54.44]Alright.
[194:54.64]I'm not going to get too cocky here.
[194:59.04]Bays.
[194:59.97]Alright.
[195:01.35]One more item and I've got to get out.
[195:05.80]Maybe some money.
[195:07.48]Oh, somebody's in there.
[195:08.34]Hold on.
[195:10.21]Alright, I've got a router.
[195:14.55]I can't... Right here, I've got another router.
[195:16.89]That's two routers.
[195:19.23]That's good enough.
[195:20.79]Anybody outside right now?
[195:21.66]Alright, I'm good.
[195:30.88]Okay, back to the car.
[195:31.88]Let's sell this stuff.
[195:37.03]Clean job.
[195:40.13]I'm all fucking around.
[195:40.95]Like, I've just... I've let, like, just the bullshit get to me right now.
[195:48.37]I can sell the routers.
[195:49.35]One of them was sought after.
[195:50.27]Ugh.
[196:06.95]What?!
[196:16.74]4k?
[196:17.02]Yeah, there's like 4,200 people here.
[196:20.08]Hope you guys are having fun.
[196:27.20]Doom?
[196:27.84]Oh, I'm not gonna play the Doom soundtrack.
[196:33.20]I'm not gonna play the Doom soundtrack.
[196:45.58]Do I have to play the Doom soundtrack?
[196:48.48]Break the toilet in 1.05.
[196:50.54]Sure.
[196:52.30]Break the dishes.
[196:53.18]Break the toilet.
[196:54.10]Break all their glasses.
[196:55.50]Can I do something that's not smashing shit?
[196:59.86]I don't want to just break everything.
[197:01.18]Alright, I need some security tips.
[197:06.34]They leave the balcony door open and I need... I want their routines.
[197:09.21]There's no one at home.
[197:10.63]There is no one home between 11 and 2 at 1.05.
[197:16.18]Possible loot location.
[197:17.14]They bought a pricey painting.
[197:18.60]Why am I paying for this?
[197:24.27]Alright.
[197:25.31]Fine.
[197:27.05]You're gonna have to give the people what they want, right?
[197:48.81]Eh?
[198:37.53]Okay, that was Doom theme sped up by 1.5 times, and then I put it up times two.
[198:41.91]There you go.
[198:44.81]Hope you liked it.
[198:45.39]Please pay attention.
[198:54.29]Ugh.
[199:07.76]That wasn't me laughing.
[199:08.52]That was me doing the trumpet that we played for five seconds there.
[199:14.90]Ugh.
[199:17.67]Alright.
[199:18.43]There's a lot of... I'm not going to do the 108 yet.
[199:21.11]We're going to go back to... I don't know what to do with 104, man.
[199:24.87]But seriously.
[199:25.41]Alright.
[199:25.71]So 105, I need to break the toilet and break their TV.
[199:32.07]So I need to get sleep in the car starting at 9 p.m.
[199:37.47]I got until 2 a.m.
[199:41.10]from 9 p.m.
[199:42.06]No, from 11 p.m.
[199:45.30]until 2 a.m.
[199:47.42]It's empty.
[199:48.92]I can do whatever the hell I want in 105.
[200:07.34]You can sleep backwards?
[200:09.10]How do you go to bed backwards?
[200:13.47]Alright.
[200:25.27]So.
[200:27.09]1.05 it is.
[200:28.19]We need 11pm.
[200:31.49]We gotta be out by like 1.30.
[200:33.79]Break the toilet and break their TV.
[200:39.57]So here is 105.
[200:43.30]There it is.
[200:44.88]Just wait for them to leave.
[200:47.42]Is there something I can climb in here?
[200:50.06]Okay, I can break in here, climb up the vine, TV, bathroom.
[200:56.23]Now we just have to be patient.
[200:57.89]Until 11pm.
[201:01.27]Here they come.
[201:04.24]Shut the door.
[201:06.04]No, I need to be able to get in there quick.
[201:12.66]Hydrate.
[201:13.72]Come on.
[201:21.91]Count it down here.
[201:22.49]10, 10, 45.
[201:22.99]He's gonna be standing outside their house.
[201:35.52]Did they come out the front door?
[201:39.32]What about this here?
[201:41.64]When are they here?
[201:43.98]No, this is a lot harder for this house.
[201:46.50]Alright, here we go.
[201:51.55]Coming out the front door.
[201:53.65]I'm just standing here.
[201:55.21]This is what I do.
[201:56.85]Alright, you disappeared.
[201:58.01]It is now 11 o'clock.
[201:59.23]There's nobody in this house, right?
[202:14.89]This is 105, right?
[202:17.71]Yes.
[202:18.67]Okay.
[202:19.38]Steal- I can take it.
[202:22.04]I can actually just take it.
[202:38.73]Play through the fire and flames.
[202:42.65]No, I'm not gonna play Through the Fire and Flames, what, from like 2007?
[202:59.92]It's still good.
[203:00.68]I know, it's a good Guitar Hero song.
[203:06.36]Alright, what time?
[203:06.82]We gotta time check.
[203:07.66]12, we're good.
[203:09.64]Nobody coming?
[203:10.18]Okay.
[203:10.54]Okay.
[203:14.34]So we got the TV.
[203:15.12]Now we need to break the toilet.
[203:18.14]Nobody here.
[203:18.54]I can stick... Ooh, chessboard!
[203:20.32]That's all I can take, apparently.
[203:28.03]Can I fit more than one thing in the car?
[203:31.25]I wish I could see.
[203:45.92]What's wrong with me?
[203:48.54]Alright, we're getting close here.
[203:49.46]I gotta hurry up and do this.
[203:57.10]Ow.
[204:06.73]He's serious.
[204:07.87]I can't fit more than one thing in the car.
[204:09.05]What's worth more?
[204:11.56]This one is... 10 experience.
[204:15.34]And...
[204:17.53]If I can't have it, nobody can.
[204:28.16]Break the toilet.
[204:54.26]No!
[204:55.54]No, what?
[204:57.30]No!
[204:58.64]No!
[204:58.94]How?
[205:04.45]How did this happen?
[205:06.94]Get me out of here, come on!
[205:39.17]It doesn't... I don't understand.
[205:46.94]How did I even get in here?
[205:54.08]Lean out.
[205:55.25]Lean out.
[205:55.91]Lean... Freeze!
[206:14.66]I don't even know how I got stuck in there.
[206:17.06]I turned the corner and, like, I bumped into the... I'm gonna have to do that again.
[206:29.73]What is it?
[206:30.89]9, 10 o'clock.
[206:31.47]God.
[206:32.31]I'm gonna do it real quick.
[206:34.35]Keep the trunk open.
[206:37.13]That was my fault?
[206:40.69]Why was it my fault?
[206:42.93]Because I ran...
[206:44.37]And bumped into the wall?
[206:55.06]You should've played- Your ass is too big.
[207:10.31]I should've just slept til- I'm just gonna go sleep til 11.
[207:16.45]Park next to the house.
[207:17.37]No, that's suspicious.
[207:19.29]That's suspicious.
[207:19.91]I can't do that.
[207:25.54]No, sleep in the car.
[207:36.37]Park in their garage.
[207:38.29]I can't even open their garage.
[207:39.37]I don't have a garage door opener, guys.
[207:47.91]Let's make this quick.
[208:03.50]Break the toilet first.
[208:05.18]I know.
[208:05.60]I know.
[208:06.32]I know I should have done that.
[208:08.34]Why am I doing it like this?
[208:11.52]Toilet first, you muppet.
[208:14.66]But it was I had ah forget it get the TV last I know I know these things but I'm so stupid that I did it in the reverse order I'm gonna walk very slowly through this house
[208:50.72]Okay, nice and safe.
[208:52.06]We're good?
[208:53.14]Turn off the flashlight.
[208:57.20]What is blinking over here?
[208:58.72]Oh, break or steal the... Alright, can I take money?
[209:00.95]Yeah, I'll take it.
[209:02.99]I can't take the stereo, the receiver.
[209:06.33]Can't take anything else.
[209:08.47]I can take... No, I can't take this.
[209:09.55]It doesn't fit in the car.
[209:17.70]Does anyone want to break people's plates, too?
[209:20.39]It's in the other place.
[209:21.23]Okay, that's it, right?
[209:22.35]Good?
[209:22.72]Go?
[209:23.22]Go.
[209:28.16]Somebody's here.
[209:31.76]Forget about the bar.
[209:32.32]Gotta run with the crowbar.
[209:33.44]Alright, time to go.
[209:50.55]Other house?
[209:51.81]I need more information on those houses.
[209:56.67]Raid the fridge, yeah.
[209:58.19]That's alright.
[209:58.59]That was perfect.
[210:00.48]How is that a B?
[210:01.26]I did it exquisitely.
[210:02.54]Alright, I gotta sell that TV.
[210:12.63]What do I got? $8.95.
[210:17.68]Car parts, electronics, kitchen, other, antiques.
[210:24.12]All this takes place here.
[210:25.28]Okay, 107.
[210:27.85]I can't do 107 until I get the better... I don't think I can do either one of these.
[210:33.37]I think I can sneak into 106 if I break the window or something, but I need the level 3... This one.
[210:40.58]That's 1,200 bucks.
[210:44.84]Okay, what do I get for intel on...
[210:48.34]104.
[210:48.36]I got two of these done.
[210:50.48]Nothing.
[210:50.74]Okay.
[210:52.11]106.
[210:53.41]Break the sink.
[210:53.95]Break the dishes.
[210:55.03]Info.
[210:56.11]They leave the window open in the back right.
[210:58.75]So that's the only time that nobody's there.
[211:02.55]107.
[211:02.61]No, nothing.
[211:04.11]108.
[211:04.23]I know nothing.
[211:05.55]They leave the window open on the second floor.
[211:06.90]I could probably sneak in there.
[211:09.70]Break or steal the big TV.
[211:11.02]I can't know because the TV's in the room with the guy with the harder lock.
[211:14.46]I can't do it.
[211:19.44]I'm going to say, let's do 106.
[211:26.71]Let's actually stake this place up.
[211:28.63]Because I need to break the sink and break the dishes.
[211:31.31]So let's go to 106.
[211:32.83]After I sell the TV.
[211:46.65]Alright, big TV.
[211:48.39]Hopefully it's worth something.
[211:56.04]Here you go.
[211:56.40]Welcome back.
[211:58.10]What do you take for a big TV?
[211:59.46]120 bucks.
[212:02.84]How do I unlock that?
[212:12.71]I'm going to buy this wipe it and we'll talk.
[212:20.98]Okay, 106.
[212:21.18]Time for a stakeout.
[212:31.27]Wipe it with a cloth.
[212:33.51]I'm not sure that's how it works.
[212:37.21]It'd be really easy to delete your whole phone that way.
[212:42.17]Alright, 106.
[212:45.50]Let's get a good stakeout position.
[213:08.36]Alright, so what time is it right now?
[213:09.68]It is currently 2.11 a.m.
[213:13.30]So I need to find out where they are here now.
[213:16.13]Are they here or are they not here?
[213:21.13]It's a decent question.
[213:23.35]Everything I need to do is upstairs.
[213:24.65]Break the dishes, break the sink.
[213:28.49]And they have a pricey painting.
[213:29.56]They got a lot of stuff in 106.
[213:38.64]106.
[213:41.88]The front door can be opened, and I've got to wait till no one... Is no one taking the living room or anything?
[213:57.10]Wait for this person to get out of here.
[214:02.67]This is what purgatory is like.
[214:04.01]There's just nine families, and one man just tries to rob you for all eternity.
[214:12.09]I just have to deal with this one guy.
[214:13.41]I would also probably either move or try to catch this person.
[214:22.34]Change the locks.
[214:24.16]Not that it really does anything.
[214:25.30]Alright, we're in.
[214:28.56]Okay, so I know that right now, they're gonna be getting up fairly soon here.
[214:33.01]So I need to break this sink and break their dishes and then they leave the window open in the back.
[214:39.15]So this window here, okay, this is the painting.
[214:42.38]So should I just get the heck out of here?
[214:44.06]You know what I'm saying?
[214:44.64]I think I'm just gonna get the heck out of here with this painting.
[215:10.29]Yeah, I just wanted to see if the... I was seeing if the toilet was down here, but they're all upstairs.
[215:17.87]Wait, I can get intel.
[215:18.69]Hold on.
[215:19.39]Intel.
[215:34.52]I can't get intel here?
[215:36.82]Okay, I'll get it.
[215:38.74]Okay.
[215:41.72]That guy's not gonna wake up.
[215:42.62]Okay, I gotta... So, they're really... I don't think there's any real window there.
[215:46.48]Here's what I'm gonna do.
[215:54.18]I'm gonna prop the door open.
[215:56.76]Don't!
[215:58.22]Okay, they're fine.
[215:58.95]I'm gonna get this out the door.
[216:00.21]Like, right here.
[216:03.97]And then we're gonna go for a... We're gonna smash the sink, smash the dishes, and we'll sprint out of the house as fast as we can.
[216:13.22]Here we go.
[216:13.78]Ready?
[216:23.36]You... What do you think...
[216:43.16]Toilet.
[216:43.74]No, I'm not going back for the toilet.
[216:46.22]I ain't gonna lose.
[216:46.88]Have they not hear that?
[216:50.96]It was all the way upstairs.
[216:53.06]They probably thought it was the cat.
[217:05.39]Let's get out.
[217:07.15]Good, nice and clean.
[217:08.27]Look, I'm getting the hang of this.
[217:11.99]I'm figuring this out real quick.
[217:14.64]You know what I'm saying?
[217:24.08]After four hours?
[217:26.92]Yeah, but hold on.
[217:28.00]You gotta give me a little bit of credit here.
[217:31.38]Like 30 or 40 minutes of this was like losing our minds like on acid to Pink Panther remixes.
[217:37.43]So I don't, you know what I'm saying?
[217:39.85]Does that count?
[217:49.31]Alright, 1500.
[217:50.11]Let's get it.
[217:50.51]Alright, I got the lockpick.
[217:54.42]Now we can test it out.
[217:57.44]Got the electrical lockpick.
[217:59.52]So now I can... Can I test it on something?
[218:01.60]I don't have, like, a training thing.
[218:10.13]But I do have the new gear, so I'm allowed to do it.
[218:13.70]Because now I can... Alright, lockpicking four.
[218:17.56]Here's lockpicking three.
[218:18.84]So I have what I need.
[218:20.18]I have a point, though.
[218:22.60]25% more backpack space.
[218:27.39]I mean, that's just good.
[218:31.37]I mean, that's just good.
[218:32.55]I'll just take it.
[218:36.30]Alright, let's go to 108 and break in there after we pawn the TV.
[218:46.22]This game is like watching Paint get a license at the DMV.
[218:49.86]That'd be really, really entertaining.
[218:51.46]That'd be awesome.
[218:53.82]Can you imagine that?
[218:57.20]Think of what would need to happen for that to be a reality.
[219:00.98]So much going on there.
[219:02.16]I would have a ton of questions.
[219:07.17]Welcome back.
[219:10.45]350 bucks.
[219:11.93]I'll take it.
[219:12.33]Alright, break into 108.
[219:24.21]How do you wipe the drive?
[219:25.24]Probably with like an electronic hacking kit.
[219:27.94]I would assume.
[219:35.82]So how is it pronounced?
[219:36.76]Is it Jupe or Jup?
[219:39.12]It is Jupe.
[219:40.78]Because it's short for Jupiter.
[219:42.53]So it is Jupe.
[219:47.99]Alright, I need to case out 108.
[219:57.05]Wrong.
[219:59.53]Yeah, we all love that big planet Jupiter, don't we?
[220:06.77]Parking space right here Only real germamites know the truth Yeah, come on you guys you got to be like a real germamite Alright time to case
[220:38.69]I don't know anything.
[220:39.63]If they leave the window open on the second floor, that's good to know.
[220:45.85]Like how the GIF creator says GIF so we can ignore you.
[220:52.18]I mean, come on.
[220:53.32]Are you really going to put like a Reese's Reese's argument in front of me here?
[220:57.48]Say it however you want.
[220:58.22]Okay, we've got some intel.
[221:05.64]Now I'm going to go get a bag of Reese's Pieces and bring them up here and eat them.
[221:18.95]This can be opened.
[221:19.43]This is a simple lock.
[221:21.11]Uh, nobody around, right?
[221:21.99]Let's go.
[221:27.21]Whoa!
[221:34.06]That wasn't very simple, was it?
[221:42.59]Alright, we gotta find a person.
[221:43.73]Nothing in the garage.
[221:49.91]Not that I can see.
[221:50.85]I want a brick.
[221:56.34]I've not seen a brick the whole time.
[222:03.40]Holy shit, this game is just actually Skyrim.
[222:06.30]Uh-oh.
[222:12.41]You didn't even... Come on, man.
[222:13.99]Like, really?
[222:14.55]Let's watch from a distance.
[222:41.80]Are they still looking at me?
[222:55.73]Somebody make an entrance here.
[223:00.07]I'm watching that tail end here.
[223:01.49]I'm gonna be careful.
[223:02.35]Why do I have two stars?
[223:05.90]I've done a good job of hiding.
[223:06.98]Why would I get two?
[223:14.41]Why would you pronounce it Reese's as Reese's it's a name and you should respect the creator by pronouncing it correctly Okay, we're there watching TV I don't know where the police are but they're apparently still around.
[223:34.20]Alright, so I know that somebody leaves here Why would you there's no way
[223:43.35]Okay.
[223:44.19]So I know what they're doing for a little bit.
[223:48.99]Living room.
[223:49.41]They all go in the living room.
[223:52.95]Back window is open on the second floor.
[224:06.63]Who the fuck is opening this?
[224:09.59]Are they leaving?
[224:12.47]I think he's actually leaving.
[224:14.01]They're both leaving Why are they over here?
[224:24.85]What are you police doing?
[224:26.31]How long are you gonna do this for?
[224:32.25]Can I climb this?
[224:41.77]Alright, we're getting to the time frame now.
[224:43.39]He's out.
[224:44.35]Oh my god.
[224:47.30]Will you go away?
[224:50.78]Is it Jerma or Jerma?
[225:06.83]What else can I even do here?
[225:20.23]I thought I could get away with it.
[225:24.76]Again, he's not on the mini-map.
[225:30.24]I don't understand the whole red on the mini-map thing.
[225:39.09]The police cars are the things that are red on the mini-map, so they just have like a regular pedestrian?
[225:47.69]Okay, well whatever alright well weird that you could see me all the way over there, but I Need to find out more and so what time is it right now?
[225:57.02]8 a.m.. I already know what like they're doing I'm gonna go up here See if I can look through a window
[226:10.45]Come on.
[226:10.65]Somebody be in one of these rooms.
[226:13.44]It's 1-13.
[226:14.32]I know everything about 1-13.
[226:15.54]Don't need to do that.
[226:16.28]I need to get that intel again.
[226:20.12]I'm gonna go sleep in the car.
[226:22.44]Just wait till night.
[226:35.23]Go sleep in their bed.
[226:39.65]Yeah, I'll go sleep right here.
[226:42.59]Sleep like four hours or so.
[226:44.44]Five hours.
[226:44.98]Let's go to 4 p.m.
[226:56.84]I just want to be able to at least... Because three people in the house is kind of... That's going to be hard.
[227:03.95]Anything could be anywhere.
[227:10.86]Alright, so... Alright, here we go.
[227:13.82]So, two people are out.
[227:14.98]There's only one person in the kitchen right now.
[227:18.52]So, at this moment, I could climb up the front.
[227:23.39]I could climb up... Right now, I could climb up the front door, pop that open, and then leave out the... Yeah.
[227:30.48]I have to wait until all these people are gone.
[227:48.27]I'm going to have to worry about this in just a minute here.
[227:51.15]He's going to be hanging out down there.
[227:52.35]Alright, let's do that.
[227:54.30]I don't know how this works.
[227:55.30]I didn't do the tutorial of this.
[228:01.52]Apparently that's it.
[228:02.16]Uh-oh, somebody's coming home.
[228:06.53]Somebody's home.
[228:06.85]Somebody's home.
[228:07.17]Somebody's home.
[228:08.23]They're coming home right now.
[228:09.85]See if I can time this.
[228:10.49]When they go in the front door, I'm going to throw it out there.
[228:13.41]I can't get this out there.
[228:14.37]I can't do it.
[228:15.93]No, it's not going to happen.
[228:24.10]I gotta do this at night.
[228:28.86]Put it down.
[228:31.00]Really?
[228:31.30]Why is the door not unlocked?
[228:44.12]It'll be right in front.
[228:46.84]They're not gonna pick their TV up.
[228:59.69]Just wait till it chills out a little bit, and then go pick up the TV and go home.
[229:08.00]You definitely have to do this at night, though.
[229:09.98]And sneak through.
[229:14.53]I'm not gonna do it like that.
[229:15.75]I'm just gonna go get the TV.
[229:16.83]I'm gonna pull a car up.
[229:33.75]Go arrest that guy, not me.
[229:36.81]Arrest the guy that just drove you off the road.
[229:54.66]Do the cops give up?
[229:56.70]Eventually, yeah, if you're out of the way.
[230:02.53]Alright, we're good, right?
[230:03.34]Nope.
[230:04.06]Almost.
[230:04.38]It's just like running around in circles.
[230:16.91]I need to go hide somewhere.
[230:19.03]Where is that car driving?
[230:26.28]There's so many bins, I know.
[230:43.79]Alright.
[230:46.86]The search is now concluded.
[230:49.38]I'm just gonna get in this dumb thing.
[230:54.40]So, I'll just sit here.
[231:01.97]Don't even tell me that me getting in this is why I'm gonna get caught.
[231:08.59]We're good?
[231:14.07]Okay, 108.
[231:16.19]Let's go grab that TV.
[231:23.75]There it is.
[231:24.67]The door is still open.
[231:28.21]Free TV.
[231:30.49]Thanks.
[231:37.18]What are you doing?
[231:38.98]Don't break it.
[231:43.42]That's very nice of you.
[231:44.64]Thanks.
[231:46.96]If you found it on the ground, it's legally yours.
[231:49.08]Is that true?
[231:49.94]What's the legality there?
[231:53.42]So if there's just TV on the ground, is it legal to pick it up?
[232:03.80]No, of course not.
[232:04.82]Because it's on their property.
[232:06.80]Alright, but what if it was on the ground in the street?
[232:14.18]For more than three days.
[232:19.32]Then it's, then it's yours.
[232:25.53]Don't they have a scenario, where if you find, like, a bag of money on the ground, you have, you have to bring it to the police?
[232:32.69]Let's say you pulled over on the side of the road, you were taking a piss, because you're on, like, a 50 hour long road trip or something, and there's, like, a suitcase on the side of the road, somewhere in, like, Nebraska.
[232:42.65]It's like a million dollars in cash.
[232:45.35]You have to bring that to the police station and if nobody claims it within like two weeks, you get to keep it, right?
[232:53.72]That's how it works.
[233:02.30]Yeah, you pick up a briefcase full of like 50 grand in cash and you immediately call the IRS.
[233:10.31]That's the first thing you do.
[233:20.55]You don't want someone to see their own necklace at the pawn shop.
[233:24.89]You gotta break it down first.
[233:30.33]Okay, learn appraisal level two.
[233:32.17]Alright.
[233:33.33]Yeah, from my understanding is like, so if you found $50,000 in cash on the side of the road, first thing you do, just put it down, call the IRS.
[233:39.62]Say, tell them you found $75,000.
[233:41.30]And say, yes, I'd like to report it on my income, please.
[233:50.65]What do I need for this?
[233:55.21]So I need one, how many, level nine?
[233:57.19]One more level, almost there.
[234:05.46]And then another, what you should also do is say, oh, by the way, can you like, can you just go back and like check the last like seven years of my taxes?
[234:13.04]I had really awful bookkeeping and can you like just make sure that it was correct?
[234:20.83]Go back like 10 years.
[234:22.11]Alright.
[234:25.92]Jewel retool.
[234:26.62]I got to get these.
[234:31.11]What if you found five bucks?
[234:32.11]Yeah, call up and report it.
[234:33.83]If you found like a $5 bill on the ground, immediately call the IRS.
[234:53.28]What about a penny?
[234:54.40]Yeah.
[235:01.06]What else can I do?
[235:01.64]Make sure you're crying when you call.
[235:11.38]Like if you and your friend split, you go to coffee together.
[235:13.99]So you and your friend go up to coffee and, you know, hey, I got this, man.
[235:18.51]Oh, thanks, dude.
[235:19.69]Let me at least give you like a couple of dollars.
[235:22.03]And you're like, oh, thanks, man.
[235:24.68]And he gives you like three bucks in cash because you put it on your card.
[235:27.62]You have to call the IRS and cry like, I'm so sorry.
[235:31.64]I have three dollars to report.
[235:32.66]My friend gave it to me.
[235:36.33]We were splitting coffee in a coffee shop.
[235:41.76]Alright, let's see... Rent-A-Thug.
[235:52.96]Break their window on the second floor.
[235:56.68]And break or steal a decoration.
[235:58.73]Okay.
[236:07.17]Somebody really hates the Wilsons, yeah.
[236:12.10]I just got a dollar.
[236:15.26]Oh, shit!
[236:16.08]I got a dollar.
[236:24.53]Hold on, let me just hold on a second.
[236:39.65]Yup.
[236:41.19]Yep, that's me.
[236:43.88]Got a dollar.
[236:47.38]But that's not how it works.
[236:48.96]It's not like a direct line.
[236:50.22]Yep, it's me.
[236:53.98]I get to call every time.
[237:06.56]It's me.
[237:23.62]No, guys, pay your taxes.
[237:26.12]Pay your taxes.
[237:28.94]But just make sure you stash at least like 10 grand in gold under your bed.
[237:47.27]Wait, is that- do I still have a TV in the back of the car?
[237:56.37]No, I gotta... The pawn shop... No, 107.
[238:01.05]I'm gonna park it at a different place.
[238:08.22]Yeah, I invested all my money in Spongebob DVDs.
[238:19.46]Do I get, like, to claim, like, capital gains for that?
[238:24.42]Spongebob, the Season 1 Spongebob DVD, original box, I mean, has definitely appreciated in value by at least, like, $40.
[238:31.23]Do I have to claim that?
[238:32.27]Alright, um, oh, I just, no, I, okay, I park normally.
[238:40.32]That's gonna hurt my brain.
[238:46.79]Alright, well, here's the thing.
[238:47.57]Okay, so can I claim a capital loss?
[238:49.87]So if the SpongeBob DVDs, if I buy 150 SpongeBob DVDs, and 10 years from now, they're worth like a dollar each, and I paid like $20 a piece for them, do I get to claim capital losses if I sell them?
[239:02.50]You know, I've invested in like 100 SpongeBob DVDs, but I've sold them at a loss.
[239:34.63]Alright, I got some intel.
[239:35.67]Break or steal a decoration.
[239:37.05]Okay, break the toilet, break the window on the second floor, and break the- This is a $900 job.
[239:59.59]And I know nothing about the Wilsons, but we're breaking in.
[240:10.71]Because it is 1 a.m.
[240:13.09]They're probably asleep.
[240:15.07]So, actually, keep this open.
[240:17.85]So... Break.
[240:19.93]They got a printer, too.
[240:20.75]Alright, where's my escape route?
[240:34.91]Why... What's going on here?
[240:38.81]Did they hear me take the printer?
[240:42.06]Because they're both upstairs.
[240:42.90]They heard me take the printer.
[240:44.86]Alright.
[240:45.52]Where... Can I throw this over?
[240:46.58]Oh.
[240:55.52]Get the fuck out of here.
[240:56.47]I can't... Alright.
[240:57.23]Printer.
[240:58.35]Garbage can.
[241:00.15]Now break toilet.
[241:01.09]Break window on the second floor.
[241:02.31]Break the... There's so much stuff to break.
[241:04.07]I need to know when they're not going to be here.
[241:06.31]I think I take the printer and run.
[241:17.69]Break the toilet.
[241:19.62]Break the wine glasses.
[241:21.16]This is all spread out.
[241:22.06]I'm going to make sure these doors are all open.
[241:33.36]Okay.
[241:34.30]The wine glasses are outside, so I'm going to do it last.
[241:36.24]Okay.
[241:40.89]Make sure this is open as well, just in case I have a panic attack and I need to leave.
[241:52.44]Alright, here we go.
[241:53.38]Wine, so I get toilet.
[241:56.46]Window, toilet, wine.
[241:58.44]Hop the fence.
[242:05.47]Break the window on the second floor.
[242:07.17]Which window?
[242:08.01]Just break any window?
[242:09.47]Or break the window on the second floor?
[242:12.69]Does it matter which one?
[242:13.57]You know what I'm saying?
[242:21.04]So if it's any window, then I can break.
[242:23.26]So they're asleep right now.
[242:24.18]So bang bang out that door.
[242:27.48]Here we go.
[242:36.15]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[242:37.85]What happened?
[242:38.37]Why did I teleport?
[242:39.97]Why?
[242:41.33]What in the name of happening?
[242:56.89]Get in the toilet!
[243:03.91]I got the printer.
[243:04.51]The printer's fine.
[243:07.95]The printer is right below me.
[243:09.11]Right in front of me here.
[243:16.61]Oh, I didn't break or steal a decoration.
[243:18.17]Oh, it's a different house.
[243:27.67]I'm going to see the printer on the ground in front of where I'm hiding.
[243:32.96]I wonder where he went.
[243:34.72]No, they're not that smart.
[243:39.12]Oh no, he's looking at the printer.
[243:52.92]The TV's in the car?
[243:54.42]Is the TV in the car?
[243:56.20]I didn't see it.
[244:04.00]No, there's no TV back there.
[244:05.60]Didn't we just look?
[244:09.70]I have a TV back there?
[244:11.52]Don't say that.
[244:13.92]You didn't sell it.
[244:15.14]I didn't?
[244:32.07]Okay.
[244:38.07]I need to be... I gotta make sure this is correct.
[244:41.42]Oh, I can't go that way.
[244:44.12]I can't go that way either.
[244:45.56]I gotta wait till these people are all gone.
[245:09.01]Hold on, this is important.
[245:11.15]I think I can do another job here.
[245:20.78]Well, get a better car!
[245:21.94]Why can you only fit one printer in there?
[245:32.74]Shit!
[245:34.94]No!
[245:35.58]I can't put anything else back here?
[245:55.78]What an absolute disgrace.
[245:59.84]But it's okay, though, because now... Here's what I'm gonna do.
[246:08.47]Easy.
[246:08.85]Hold on.
[246:09.21]This is open.
[246:13.51]107.
[246:13.53]There's something to do here at 108.
[246:16.55]So, break or steal a decoration.
[246:19.21]The car's right there.
[246:19.99]Let's go.
[246:20.35]Quickly.
[246:20.65]Quickly.
[246:28.07]I just did break something in their house.
[246:31.69]Why is this closed?
[246:33.51]Oh, fuck it.
[246:35.73]They're gonna be like, oh, your car's in a weird place!
[246:37.76]Let's just get out of here.
[246:44.82]I'm gonna bring the TV back anyways.
[247:00.83]You can't put it in the passenger seat?
[247:02.51]What criminal goes in and takes one TV and leaves?
[247:09.16]No, you go find their bed and go under their bed with all the Spongebob DVDs, all the gold, all the fucking money.
[247:17.04]Welcome back.
[247:31.56]700 bucks.
[247:33.72]I'll take it.
[247:36.27]Alright, I got some money now.
[247:37.27]I need a little bit more experience.
[247:40.29]Close this up.
[247:43.33]What do we got now?
[247:44.95]We got 101.
[247:45.39]There's nothing here.
[247:47.64]104.
[247:47.66]We already did it.
[247:50.80]Nothing at 106.
[247:51.12]107 is done.
[247:51.36]108.
[247:51.48]I need to break or steal a decoration.
[248:02.41]111.
[248:02.77]I have nothing else on these.
[248:04.31]I got one.
[248:04.73]Break or steal a pear decoration at 113.
[248:07.49]I'll do this one.
[248:14.72]Break or steal a decoration.
[248:16.44]So 108.
[248:17.60]Let's case it out a little bit here.
[248:21.94]I can't believe I played this game for four hours.
[248:29.66]I'm still having fun too.
[248:31.08]I'm having a good time right now.
[248:32.82]This is fun.
[248:41.91]I can't believe it either.
[248:44.53]I'm having a good time. 108.
[249:00.96]Uh, there's a parking garage.
[249:04.39]Uh, actually, the other one's probably a little bit, yeah, this one's closer.
[249:06.91]Because I can probably hop the fence back here.
[249:17.33]Let's learn about the people here.
[249:29.98]Okay.
[249:30.54]Break the decoration.
[249:31.66]They leave the window open on the second floor.
[249:33.54]I'm not tall enough to look.
[249:40.91]I don't know where they are now.
[249:41.95]This would be a good time to get some... I don't want to break that.
[249:47.09]They'll know.
[249:48.13]They'll freak out about it.
[249:53.38]Somebody look outside or do something.
[250:01.25]Nobody there?
[250:04.77]Is there no one here?
[250:05.99]Okay, there's a person right there.
[250:10.39]Alright.
[250:12.67]So, looks like they're all upstairs right now.
[250:15.53]I could probably just sprint, smash, run.
[250:23.79]Yep, I'm going for it.
[250:43.39]Where's the car?
[251:08.89]Is that not it?
[251:16.89]Drop it and destroy it.
[251:23.51]Wow, why is it?
[251:57.38]Oh, okay.
[251:59.46]That was it.
[252:07.32]F. It's alright.
[252:09.80]Sometimes you get an F. No antiques.
[252:13.86]You don't want anything.
[252:16.17]We're almost... I need to break or steal the pear decoration from 113, and that's all we got.
[252:21.27]We're at the end there.
[252:23.86]I have money.
[252:24.44]Jewelry tools requires appraisal too.
[252:28.56]Can't do it yet.
[252:34.70]Headphones?
[252:39.01]So let's just go get that done.
[252:40.37]I will be the next level to do appraisal.
[252:42.21]And then we're probably going to get some new missions.
[252:44.31]Maybe we'll go to a new neighborhood.
[252:47.55]That'd be interesting.
[252:54.83]Welcome back.
[252:55.63]Okay, bye.
[253:01.95]113.
[253:05.71]Because there's definitely a list of neighborhoods that go underneath that.
[253:08.79]Okay. 113.
[253:28.95]Is my antenna bent?
[253:29.87]Or is it just like that?
[253:44.60]Here are the rest.
[253:47.89]Alright, pocket!
[253:54.47]Well, now it's bent.
[253:55.41]Alright, one thirteen.
[253:56.87]Break or steal the pear decoration.
[254:07.76]What else you got over here?
[254:10.54]Headphones.
[254:11.08]Those are expensive.
[254:15.02]Anybody home?
[254:23.51]No, nobody home.
[254:25.52]See you later.
[254:29.88]There it is.
[254:30.34]Okay, hold on.
[254:34.20]Nobody's gonna be here for a long time.
[254:35.60]Take everything.
[254:38.57]My inventory's already full.
[254:42.03]Are you kidding me?
[254:44.31]What the hell?
[254:45.05]Really?
[254:45.33]There's no money?
[254:47.25]What do I have that's so heavy?
[254:59.36]drop stuff?
[255:02.24]It's probably the guitar that's so heavy.
[255:04.99]It's worth a lot of money, though.
[255:06.21]$15.
[255:19.89]It's nothing.
[255:20.89]Alright, let's move.
[255:27.42]There's a router.
[255:28.14]I can't... What's so heavy?
[255:31.67]Lock picks, front door key.
[255:36.13]Crowbar.
[255:38.57]The guitar, the bass, and the headphones are very heavy.
[255:43.89]The guitar is extremely heavy.
[255:48.72]Leave them without internet.
[255:49.96]Okay.
[255:50.12]Okay.
[256:02.05]Knife set.
[256:03.38]Can't take the microwave too heavy.
[256:06.40]Tea box?
[256:14.81]Ooh, nice house.
[256:19.31]No, give me the TV.
[256:21.13]TV's worth way more.
[256:25.10]Oh, it's a small TV.
[256:26.06]Never mind.
[256:29.00]In fact... Alright, I'm good.
[256:35.18]Let's get out.
[256:39.10]Spare key for the... Wait, give me the spare key.
[256:47.39]Hard drives?
[256:51.55]I can't really move around these.
[256:56.85]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[256:57.87]It's time to go.
[256:59.86]Time to leave.
[257:01.32]Where's the painting?
[257:06.61]Okay.
[257:07.21]Go.
[257:07.65]Out.
[257:08.07]They're going to be home in like two seconds.
[257:12.85]Use the front door.
[257:22.58]I stole that kid's money.
[257:25.72]He didn't need it.
[257:35.98]Is that person going to see this?
[257:59.33]Just drive to the edge.
[258:07.55]We're good.
[258:11.82]How could he know that anything was up?
[258:15.12]Alright.
[258:17.68]Time to level up.
[258:21.92]I need appraisal two.
[258:23.95]Disassemble jewelry with special tools.
[258:26.07]Got it.
[258:27.11]Vinny.
[258:27.93]Greenview 107 don't like our protection plan.
[258:32.29]I hope nothing happens to the jewelry in their bedroom.
[258:36.00]Do I just have to keep stealing money from the same people?
[258:42.71]I feel bad.
[258:47.45]Well, here's jewelry tools.
[258:49.71]I'm probably going to need them.
[258:52.52]Right?
[258:55.42]Whatever.
[258:55.72]Well, here's a radio.
[259:06.51]Rent a thug.
[259:07.45]Steal a painting.
[259:08.71]China.
[259:09.27]From 108.
[259:09.51]Okay.
[259:14.47]Sell the other stuff.
[259:17.45]They keep letting you get away with it.
[259:20.49]Yeah, they really do.
[259:21.39]Well, this is different.
[259:25.24]Jewelry workshop.
[259:27.04]No items.
[259:34.24]What do you do if your house keeps getting robbed?
[259:37.09]You gotta make, like, an elaborate Home Alone trap.
[259:49.22]Welcome back.
[259:51.54]Uh, the jewelry tools allow you to disable jewelry before- of course.
[259:54.64]Right, what else we got?
[259:55.50]We got the pear, got the guitar, headphones, and the painting.
[260:07.20]Yeah, at that point, I would just put the Mona Lisa in the window and then put, like, fucking tacks all over the ground.
[260:13.24]Right before it.
[260:13.78]Or, like, a trap.
[260:17.06]Just build a gigantic trap door underneath.
[260:20.83]And, like, pull the lever when the guy gets in.
[260:30.25]Nice painting.
[260:30.93]Yeah, it was ten bucks.
[260:32.67]Alright, steal jewelry from 107.
[260:35.49]When do I get to go to another place?
[260:37.47]107.
[260:52.33]Oh, it's conveniently located right here.
[261:04.83]I went down the stairs.
[261:08.38]Straight down the stairs.
[261:12.86]It was very interesting.
[261:13.88]Here we go.
[261:15.14]I didn't do that.
[261:17.62]Alright, jewelry in the bedroom.
[261:18.98]Up there.
[261:34.84]Okay, let's case it out.
[261:37.01]Because I don't know anything about 107.
[261:39.77]Absolute zero.
[261:41.29]But what I do know is that radio is not worth anything.
[261:45.85]The wine, on the other hand, is worth $20.
[261:51.40]The wine is actually worth $5 less than the radio.
[261:55.14]So, I'm not sure why I did that.
[262:00.49]Steal the gnome.
[262:11.86]Is there a gnome in this yard?
[262:15.20]Alright, well, I can open this, but I don't... Somebody might be right behind it.
[262:29.64]Alright, gotta be really careful.
[262:31.68]Steal the jewelry in the bedroom.
[262:32.96]Did I hear sound effects?
[262:48.72]come on are they in the they're right here oh is it more than one person in here now they're turning on the lights I wish I knew where they were dude they're just going back and forth turning the lights on and off like go somewhere what are you doing
[263:25.61]They're outside!
[263:26.21]Okay, jewelry.
[263:49.49]Where's the jewelry?
[263:57.86]She coming upstairs?
[264:08.45]Get in the fucking thing!
[264:17.70]No, that's towards the cops.
[264:18.74]This way.
[264:21.86]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[264:22.72]I gotta get up now.
[264:23.42]Come on, come on, come on.
[264:24.42]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[264:28.50]Just run straight for the exit.
[264:29.40]You can make it.
[264:31.66]He's closing the gap, but I'm fine.
[264:34.58]I'm good.
[264:37.22]I was trying to hide in the closet, but I couldn't fit in it.
[264:52.21]Always remember to break down the jewelry.
[264:55.49]There's a tool for it in the shop.
[265:01.20]Okay.
[265:02.44]Break it down.
[265:02.98]Select it.
[265:05.46]How do you do this?
[265:06.44]Break down the jewelry.
[265:28.91]Okay.
[265:34.09]He broke it.
[265:35.27]I was supposed to break it.
[265:40.86]You're supposed to pull out all the jewels.
[265:47.72]That's it, right?
[265:54.19]Infinity necklace.
[266:02.41]Yeah, it does look like it doesn't.
[266:06.77]What am I detaching?
[266:07.75]This better be worth a thousand dollars.
[266:21.72]No, that's just kind of there.
[266:39.97]The best I can do is $25.
[266:41.01]Take it or leave it.
[266:54.34]The best I can do is $25.
[266:55.32]That was a good one.
[266:57.96]That was a very good one.
[266:59.08]I don't know.
[267:00.06]Do I have to go break into 106 for a 15th time?
[267:11.84]And cause them all kinds of problems and anguish.
[267:17.21]Do I have anything in here?
[267:18.51]No.
[267:18.85]I have the jewelry, though.
[267:19.77]What's it worth?
[267:25.43]Bracelet parts.
[267:27.57]Well, we're gonna go find out.
[267:29.58]Unless, can I sell them on the black market or something?
[267:37.99]Electronics?
[267:38.65]Nope.
[267:39.07]Kitchen?
[267:39.65]Other... Antiques?
[267:42.55]Art?
[267:43.03]No.
[267:44.87]Looks like it's getting pawned.
[267:50.37]Steal $15 from 106 again.
[267:51.67]Alright, I got some stuff for you.
[268:02.60]Welcome back.
[268:04.50]Well, that's 800 bucks.
[268:06.94]That's a lot more than I thought it was going to be.
[268:19.51]So, I mean, now, 107, 108, steal the painting called China.
[268:28.13]I'm going to have to do it during this point.
[268:34.00]Let's go do it.
[268:39.05]Drop off the hard drive.
[268:40.01]Where do I do that?
[268:53.44]Right here.
[268:53.78]Alright, let's...
[268:59.53]I'm not going to break it.
[269:00.96]Alright, we got jewelry tools.
[269:03.80]I don't need that until I'm here.
[269:07.52]Front door key for 109.
[269:09.52]Don't need that.
[269:10.34]Front door key for 113.
[269:12.70]Put that away.
[269:13.62]Alright.
[269:19.64]This has a bunch of people.
[269:20.44]I'm like a janitor.
[269:21.32]I have everybody's keys.
[269:26.06]Whatever.
[269:47.19]Okay, let's go.
[269:48.95]Steal China.
[269:50.61]From... Where was it?
[269:54.83]101, 101, 101, 108.
[269:57.09]Steal China from 108.
[269:58.27]I will do my best.
[270:09.54]Is he gonna do it again?
[270:10.54]I think he's gonna do it again.
[270:14.85]He's gonna try to do it.
[270:15.87]Let's see if he can do it.
[270:28.54]Well, I got it.
[270:35.61]I can't leave.
[270:36.21]Uh-oh.
[270:44.39]Alright, we're good.
[270:47.24]No, no, we're not.
[270:48.30]Not at all.
[270:50.70]Oh, forward I dance!
[270:58.72]I don't know, I think I'm stuck here.
[271:21.36]Put it behind bars.
[271:26.13]Oh well.
[271:34.43]Hey, come here for a second.
[271:37.45]So I can restart the checkpoint by hitting you.
[271:41.09]Be nice.
[271:52.57]She might be able to get in the car.
[272:02.92]You're a caged animal.
[272:12.32]I don't have any V-Box.
[272:14.96]How much is one V-Dollar worth in...
[273:14.68]I have to hold sprint down so I don't hit it.
[273:20.93]Just reverse.
[273:21.65]I can't.
[273:22.83]I tried to get the wheels inside of where the stairs are.
[273:26.35]I couldn't do it.
[273:37.78]Come on.
[273:44.46]Oh, no.
[273:46.83]I think I may have ruined the whole game.
[273:52.17]I think I saw... Why would it auto-save?
[273:55.69]Right there.
[274:05.56]Is that the end?
[274:06.86]Is this where I have to end this game?
[274:09.52]What if I just don't move?
[274:15.02]Hold on, I think I can do it.
[274:17.70]I just need to get the reverse right.
[274:25.35]Okay, if I can just... When I press S, it goes forward.
[274:34.15]I'm trying to reverse right now.
[274:40.47]Come on, right here.
[274:41.73]Can I get it right here?
[274:46.42]Ooh, almost had it.
[274:48.52]Almost got it.
[275:00.67]Come on!
[275:01.21]I think I can go over this if I really try hard enough here.
[275:12.86]I think so.
[275:18.73]Ask the guy across the street.
[275:20.17]I softlocked the whole game.
[275:21.19]It's over.
[275:25.25]Was it worth it, Jeremy?
[275:42.80]I can't just... Can I just back up?
[275:44.20]I can't back up any more than this.
[275:47.85]Save it!
[275:48.17]Come on, get out!
[275:49.38]Go, go, go, go!
[275:50.20]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
[275:51.38]I did it.
[275:51.76]Okay, I made it.
[276:23.60]I did it!
[276:25.54]Not soft-locked anymore.
[276:33.13]What's the plan here?
[276:38.93]Somebody just wrote, fucking loser.

[277:39.39]No, just run.
[277:40.13]I did it.

[284:57.94]Can we get- can we get China in the next Jerma Rumble?
[285:03.94]No, I don't- what?
[285:08.36]How would that work?
[285:11.90]Like the whole- like all- like all the whole- the whole China?

[289:47.94]You can still do it.
[289:48.88]I won't tell anyone.
[289:58.15]I need more time.
[289:59.33]I was going to start screaming on it and stuff.
[290:05.15]I don't even know where we're going.
[290:06.78]107, right?
[290:30.97]I'm just kidding.
[290:32.07]I'm kidding.
[290:33.05]I'm kidding.

[290:53.27]Don't you dare joke around with us.
[290:58.74]Just hurry up and steal the China, okay?
[291:02.16]That's all that matters.
[291:03.56]Do it as fast as you possibly can.
[291:25.63]Okay, where is it?
[291:30.80]I don't even care.
[291:32.34]It's up there.
[291:34.21]Steel.
[291:54.79]That was the right one.
[291:56.23]That was the right painting.
[291:57.29]Do you understand?
[291:57.87]This is the China.
[292:00.61]That's the China.
[292:01.83]That's it.
[292:02.37]That's the China.
[292:03.50]I was right the first time.
[292:04.56]I had China.
[292:05.58]I picked up China.
[292:06.68]That was China.
[292:10.18]I stole it.
[292:10.70]I stole China.
[292:21.83]Oh.
[292:23.94]That was what it was pointing at.
[292:25.08]I had it the whole time.
[292:28.61]That's Daisy, but why is it... What happened?
[292:35.15]It was clearly... That was where it was.
[293:02.74]Alright, so... I need you to explain this to me, right?
[293:18.87]The marker was upstairs, around that corner.
[293:21.90]The daisy is the thing that's highlighted.
[293:23.66]The thing behind it is the flower.
[293:27.66]Where's the China?
[293:31.31]Where is the China?
[293:35.10]Bottom floor?
[293:36.16]Why is it pointing me upstairs?
[293:44.72]Like, this is not down here.
[293:46.56]It's very clearly like, go up there and steal China!
[294:11.44]It's like, there it is.
[294:12.64]That's it.
[294:18.24]Is that it?
[294:18.72]Is it?
[294:19.12]Is there it is?
[294:21.30]LaChina!
[294:21.68]How do you get out of your fucked up house?
[295:01.14]How do I get out of here?
[295:02.00]I need the light.
[295:03.02]Oh!
[295:03.08]Come on.
[295:10.08]Get in there.
[295:12.74]The garage door?
[295:13.62]There's no garage door opener here.
[295:19.64]Yes, there is.
[295:29.76]He got it.
[295:31.08]He got the China.
[296:25.82]Yeah!
[296:28.68]Yes!
[296:35.27]D+.
[296:44.81]Level up.
[296:45.19]Lockpicking 4.
[296:46.26]Lockpicking 4.
[296:50.00]Open safe.
[296:51.20]Use glass knife.
[296:54.15]I only need two skill points.
[296:56.15]What?
[297:03.90]What can I do now?
[297:07.26]Alright.
[297:08.76]Where's the China on here?
[297:11.12]Candle holder.
[297:11.78]Candle holder.
[297:12.20]Triple vase.
[297:13.60]Flower vase.
[297:14.82]Glass cup.
[297:16.16]The China.
[297:17.40]Where is it?
[297:33.35]Uh... I mean, I... I have it.
[297:38.31]Do I need to sell it?
[298:00.34]I've got the China right here.
[298:07.47]This is correct, right?
[298:08.41]Welcome back.
[298:10.36]Here.
[298:12.62]Four bucks.
[298:13.73]Thank you.
[298:54.06]I had it right the whole time.
[298:57.09]Everybody was screaming at me.
[298:58.83]I was being screamed at.
[298:59.97]That it was the daisy.
[299:16.22]No, no, it was a joke.
[299:17.94]And I'm glad it... See, we're fine.
[299:19.78]That's pretty... That's perfectly fine.
[299:21.24]Excuse me.
[299:24.87]Steal the China.
[299:25.99]Steal the China.
[299:27.12]Steal the China.
[299:28.18]Steal the China.
[299:29.49]Get it.
[300:08.87]Thank you.
[300:46.46]Okay, got it.
[300:55.07]Stole the daisy.
[301:05.29]No, it was the China.
[301:07.09]That was the China.
[301:16.20]I knew I wasn't crazy.
[301:17.38]I knew that I wasn't crazy, you know?
[301:24.28]New hints.
[301:26.88]Uh, I can't do the skills I want to.
[301:27.98]I need to wait until the next level.
[301:30.64]I got new notes.
[301:36.67]Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.
[301:41.73]Jobs.
[301:42.75]Jobs.
[301:42.99]I don't have any jobs.
[301:44.17]There's no jobs.
[301:46.86]I don't have any jobs.
[301:52.14]Where are the jobs?
[302:09.06]Spencer just came in and gave five community subs here.
[302:12.47]Spencer Twitch chat.
[302:15.36]Did I say Twitch chat?
[302:17.74]Twitch chat?
[302:18.38]I have no idea what the fuck's wrong with me, but thank you, Spencer.
[302:22.94]And thanks for... See, there are... Look at this.
[302:27.46]There's a bunch of neighborhoods you can go to.
[302:31.11]But thanks a lot, man.
[302:36.21]I got nothing else to do.
[302:38.49]Do I just have to go break into people's houses and steal stuff?
[302:41.69]Just get to level 4?
[302:46.73]I guess.
[302:57.85]Steal for the pleasure of it.
[302:59.25]Well, I need... Okay, now I'm gonna go to one of the bigger houses now.
[303:02.59]Steal the China to farm XP.
[303:06.00]I'm not gonna steal China to farm XP.
[303:09.70]That would be a bad, bad idea.
[303:12.99]Because China does not have very much profit.
[303:18.55]It's only worth like $15 or something.
[303:21.03]Or what was it?
[303:21.73]$40?
[303:26.02]I'd be better off stealing money from people's houses.
[303:29.16]Like these people.
[303:30.78]There's $400.
[303:32.16]Well... Is it?
[303:36.15]Should I just go do that again?
[303:42.82]It's $400.
[303:44.88]Why did I think it was like 40?
[303:46.84]Maybe it's because of all the other little ones I'm sorry guys.
[303:54.34]This is another slide.
[304:14.42]Nice!
[304:14.94]I'm gonna do it again.
[304:25.46]This is costing me too much money.
[304:40.18]Last one, I promise.
[304:40.80]Last one.
[304:41.38]I want to, like, feel the thing go down.
[304:44.06]You know, I want to feel it, like, underneath my carriage here.
[304:49.12]In first person.
[304:50.86]It's better to ride a roller coaster like this.
[305:06.96]Oh, God.
[305:07.62]We're at the top of Splash Mountain.
[305:29.04]Come on, back into this.
[305:35.33]Am I going to get the car towed?
[305:38.61]The car is going to get towed with me in it.
[305:41.93]How does that work?
[305:44.73]Hold on, I need to know how this works.
[305:45.97]He's calling the cops right now.
[305:51.26]The police will tow your car.
[305:53.84]Okay.
[305:57.98]Let's wait for the tow truck.
[306:02.53]He's waiting his turn on the slide.
[306:03.95]Yeah, well, I was too fat.
[306:06.09]I was a big fat guy and got stuck on it.
[306:10.92]Yeah, I can't open the door.
[306:13.00]I'm kind of stuck on this right now.
[306:14.90]But here comes the police to help me.
[306:21.36]Here he comes.
[306:24.26]Mm-hmm.
[306:26.47]How the hell are you going to figure out how to get here?
[306:31.93]He's going to have a lot of trouble trying to get over here.
[306:42.11]No, he's going to come back.
[306:47.73]He's going to come over here and he's going to screw the whole thing up.
[306:55.08]Well, I'm blocking both sides.
[306:57.84]So you can't walk up here and... Oh, if I could only just go down right now.
[307:02.55]If I could only just drive straight down.
[307:13.01]All the NPCs are coming over here.
[307:15.61]I don't know why they're so drawn to this place.
[307:18.72]I'm like an NPC magnet.
[307:20.16]What are you doing?
[307:21.86]It really is a line for the slide.
[307:25.26]He can't figure it out.
[307:27.08]He has no idea where to go.
[307:37.44]Can I- How do you beep?
[307:50.00]Q, no.
[307:51.62]Q opens up this wheel.
[307:55.90]There was another person.
[308:04.18]The police will tell your car the cop is gone.
[308:12.07]All great thieves honk their horn.
[308:20.55]I kind of want to see if every NPC in the whole town comes over here.
[308:23.76]Because look at this.
[308:26.05]Did you bind M3 to eat yet?
[308:27.71]I don't know what the hell I was talking about.
[308:32.28]What was I even talking about?
[308:38.56]Just come over here.
[308:39.68]Please, police officer, just drive over here.
[308:42.80]I'm very clearly causing a problem.
[308:48.14]Just drive down here.
[308:50.65]You know where I am.
[308:55.17]Turn in here.
[308:55.55]Come on.
[308:58.09]Turn in here.
[308:58.63]Turn in here.
[308:59.11]Turn.
[309:00.39]Turn.
[309:02.47]Oh, he's going to drive by us every time.
[309:04.13]The star is just fading.
[309:06.83]Come on.
[309:10.35]There's got to be something I can do about this here.
[309:17.79]I can't go forward.
[309:18.64]I can't go backwards.
[309:20.44]Nobody can do anything.
[309:24.44]I'm just going to try to hold it.
[309:26.94]How about this way?
[309:34.35]There's another person.
[309:40.31]Damn it.
[309:41.99]I can't at least climb out of the side.
[309:47.61]Well, hold on.
[309:48.11]Last chance.
[309:48.69]Come on.
[309:49.95]Turn down here.
[309:50.75]You can see me.
[309:51.27]I'm right here.
[309:52.01]I'm waving.
[309:52.39]I'll wave to you.
[309:56.45]No, he can't do it.
[309:58.29]He's not going to do it.
[309:59.05]He'll never figure it out.
[310:06.56]I wonder if I can do like a series of... Oh well.
[310:14.67]We tried.
[310:26.28]Stop stalling.
[310:27.20]What do you want me to do?
[310:28.30]I'm trying to go.
[310:32.28]Making noise?
[310:36.04]Hold on, can I- I need- I'm gonna get the actual police over here.
[310:38.86]I was just making noise, apparently.
[310:40.56]Making noise.
[310:41.08]Because if they get the actual police over here, this could get interesting.
[310:56.84]I need to- come on, just get the cops over here, like the actual, like, two stars.
[311:04.60]This could get interesting.
[311:07.50]I'm gonna give this like 10 more seconds and then I'll stop.
[311:18.72]I wish there was a horn.
[311:21.97]I'm pressing every button to try to beep.
[311:23.33]I just don't think it exists.
[311:29.61]Alt shift.
[311:32.79]I can't hit the brakes.
[311:36.56]Oh well.
[311:37.98]That's too bad.
[311:39.94]Too bad.
[311:47.94]Nah, I can't get up.
[311:49.67]I was trying to do the... Look at how funny this is to go down the slide.
[311:52.53]Alright.
[311:54.17]Where do I go?
[311:55.27]Just... I was going to steal stuff.
[312:10.34]Now do it again.
[312:11.30]I didn't sell my paintings, you're right.
[312:25.03]Your bag is full.
[312:27.29]Welcome back.
[312:31.44]Sell them all.
[312:34.16]Alright.
[312:35.26]Let's go.
[312:38.18]Sell the China.
[312:39.34]Sell the China.
[312:40.50]Sell the China.
[312:42.88]Sell the China.
[312:46.12]I'm gonna be hearing that in my sleep tonight.
[312:59.89]Buy the China back?
[313:01.92]Why would I want to buy the China back?
[313:04.64]I got $400 for it.
[313:07.11]Alright, let's make this easy.
[313:08.03]I'm going to go to... I want to go to the bigger houses over here.
[313:23.50]I didn't... Am I stuck again?
[313:25.48]I was just trying to go the other way.
[313:28.64]I can't move.
[313:29.34]I'm stuck again.
[313:29.96]At least I can get out of that goddamn car.
[313:39.74]How would I get stuck there?
[313:42.30]That's impossible.
[313:50.15]I'm just going to steal from... I have the thing to open the doors here.
[313:52.85]I'm going to get a bunch of money.
[313:55.37]From 1.13.
[313:56.25]Because I know that they're both not home.
[314:04.12]Well, they're both going to not be home.
[314:08.58]Which is better by now.

[318:19.30]More backpack space.
[318:20.35]Disassemble jewelry.
[318:23.09]Remove security from decks.
[318:26.39]Climb on the house gutters.
[318:35.51]Well, I'll give it a shot.
[318:45.41]Everything gives the same XP, so there's still a ton of small stuff.
[318:49.87]Thanks for the tip, it's a good idea.
[318:59.54]Alright, 101 is a big house.
[319:03.06]It's time to go for the big shit.
[319:14.13]101 is gigantic.
[319:15.85]Plenty of points of entry.
[319:20.78]What's the indicator here?
[319:27.78]Camera in front.
[319:28.52]Okay.
[319:30.42]Camera in front.
[319:32.99]Power switch will turn off the cameras.
[319:35.69]Well, here's the electrical.
[319:37.61]Open it up.
[319:47.93]The electricity will be fixed in 2.37.
[319:49.59]Does a guy actually come fix it?
[320:00.02]What's that way?
[320:10.49]Oh, there's people walking around out here.
[320:11.83]Is there no way for me to jump the fence?
[320:28.15]I'm going to go for it when this guy passes here.
[320:34.44]Ready?
[320:39.69]One, two, three.
[321:10.11]Did you see me?
[321:16.78]They probably have expensive shit in here.
[321:18.06]Come on, give me some intel.
[321:20.26]I can't get intel?
[321:21.64]I'm looking right at you.
[321:23.72]What?
[321:23.92]Okay, there's only two people that live here.
[321:39.93]Already got a guitar?
[321:42.35]Shit.
[321:56.11]Really?
[322:22.97]You'll never get me on the roof.
[322:24.49]You'll never get me.
[322:37.02]Let's see, they're gonna get out.
[322:49.39]Are you kidding me?
[322:59.10]Come on damn it Stop right there Alright, we're gonna go we're gonna go with a we're gonna go the new tactic
[323:17.76]It's called Find a Brick.
[323:19.80]Because I have not seen one in the almost five and a half hours that this game has been played.
[323:25.66]Has anybody seen a brick?
[323:27.84]Even one?
[323:33.96]Where the hell are they?
[323:34.66]On the sidewalks?
[323:53.29]You see one right in front of the computer screen, do you?
[324:01.58]On the ground.
[324:02.22]Yeah, I know they're on the ground, but... Whereabouts on the ground?
[324:10.44]Down alleys?
[324:11.22]I understand there's one at the bus stop.
[324:31.37]Well, there's not one at the bus stop.
[324:35.01]What about over here?
[324:36.43]This kind of park bench area.
[324:41.09]Some houses are made out of them.
[324:42.83]You know, you're right.
[324:44.77]They are.
[324:46.38]They are made out of bricks.
[324:51.44]The first brick I find.
[324:53.58]We have to get some great shots.
[325:01.53]Sidewalks near houses.
[325:06.45]Brick.
[325:43.20]Was it worth it?
[325:47.84]No.
[325:49.35]But that doesn't mean I can't get it through a window.
[325:55.69]Brick.
[325:56.51]I used to see in red bricks.
[326:01.47]Not these cement looking cinder block bricks.
[326:06.23]But I'm going to try to get it in windows.
[326:08.41]We'll play basketball from now on.
[326:18.67]Oh, I'm gonna go through that.
[326:19.53]I'm just gonna throw bricks through windows.
[326:21.39]That's pretty much the rest of the stream.
[326:22.79]I hope you guys are ready to play.
[326:25.23]I gotta get some good challenges here.
[326:34.55]But what if I can only get one brick?
[326:44.22]Try throwing it at a cop.
[326:46.12]Laughing my ass off, poser.
[326:54.71]He's not going to get it through the window.
[326:56.29]Yes, I will.
[327:02.26]If I could find one.
[327:13.70]I wish I had a brick right now.
[327:16.08]I wish I had a brick.
[327:18.50]Right now.
[327:21.18]Ugh.
[328:00.32]I need this!
[328:01.94]Hey!
[328:02.74]Oh, go away!
[328:03.52]I can't get out!
[328:04.76]I can't get out of here!
[328:06.03]Why would you do that?
[328:15.51]Thank you!
[328:19.79]What?!
[328:20.09]I didn't even get a chance!
[328:30.71]Why would you close the crazed psycho in the garage with you?
[328:41.78]That's the last thing you'd want to do.
[328:43.22]Oh my god, this guy's gonna, this guy's gonna throw bricks at me and he's running in here sprinting at me and it's wicked scary.
[328:53.61]Hey man, like you okay?
[328:54.75]What's up man?
[328:55.15]You like okay being locked in here with me?
[329:00.71]Damn it!
[329:01.15]Alright, let's sit right here.
[329:06.04]Let's see where that is.
[329:07.46]Way too low.
[329:18.61]That was close.
[329:51.89]I just want him back.
[329:52.59]We have a new house.
[330:03.90]I have to get that.
[330:05.18]What?
[330:11.22]Throw a brick at the police.
[330:13.12]I have to get a brick aimed in the right direction in the first place and not have one spawn on top of me.
[330:26.39]You just had to throw them at the house with a security camera.
[330:31.11]Bastard.
[330:32.65]I'll show this asshole.
[330:34.03]I'm gonna throw bricks at my neighbor.
[330:50.08]Okay.
[330:51.16]This is actually easier to find bricks.
[330:54.48]As you go faster like this.
[331:01.73]Alright, we got four bricks here.
[331:06.20]You thought you could stop me?
[331:08.00]You think your security cameras are gonna stop me?
[331:19.87]Next time, come to the PTA meeting, motherfucker!
[331:55.21]It was so close.
[331:59.40]Just restart it.
[332:00.92]I know what that is.
[332:02.50]Store bricks in your vehicle.
[332:05.16]Hold on, can I put bricks in the car?
[332:07.66]And then just have a never-ending rain bricks on somebody?
[333:03.21]What the fuck is he doing in the house already?
[333:05.11]Jesus!
[333:17.51]Is your husband the cop?
[333:22.42]My guy, the call came, he got that inside the house.
[333:25.30]He was getting ready for work.
[333:26.74]Perfect place to store these.
[333:28.10]Perfect place, perfect checkpoint.
[333:30.56]Alright, we're gonna go for the, we're gonna get a bunch of bricks in here.
[333:51.27]I don't think you can do this I hate this car
[334:03.93]Cars giving me nothing but trouble.
[334:05.25]I'm so bad!
[334:30.49]No!
[334:30.89]What are you doing?
[334:31.71]I didn't even cross the line.
[334:35.72]So, okay, you can't... So you can't put the bricks in the cars.
[334:40.80]I have to break a window with a brick before I turn the stream off.
[334:43.40]I'm sorry, I have to.
[334:50.73]I mean, I've pretty much got my fill of the game.
[334:53.51]This game's pretty fun.
[334:55.35]If there's more content here, that'd be better.
[334:58.47]If there's more, like, neighborhoods.
[334:59.71]I'm sure there probably is.
[335:02.34]But...
[335:04.05]I mean, I need to end this with a brick throw through a window.
[335:11.17]This is going to keep needing to happen.
[335:24.20]Where was that spot?
[335:26.58]It was back in front of the 101, right?
[335:27.90]Yeah, right here.
[335:39.72]Where are those bricks?
[335:45.40]Aren't they, like, right here?
[335:50.57]You can't steal cars in this game.
[335:52.69]They're usually, like, right here.
[336:00.25]Where do my bricks go?
[336:01.13]Oh, they're right there.
[336:08.44]Okay.
[336:15.87]Alright, I have to get this.
[336:18.37]That window right there.
[336:30.43]The same guy every day comes and tries to throw a fucking brick through your window.
[336:39.54]Yes!
[336:41.02]I did it!
[337:01.64]Underneath.
[337:11.89]What time is it?
[337:14.07]A couple sips of coffee here.
[337:15.19]That's a nice, bold, rich flavor.
[337:20.19]Honey, what are you doing?
[337:21.27]You going to work?
[337:22.36]Okay.
[337:25.47]Goodbye, kids.
[337:26.81]I'll see you later.
[337:27.71]Okay, have a great day.
[337:28.79]Alright, now I'll do what I do every day.
[337:33.46]Go to the newspaper there.
[337:35.48]Mr. Jordan, nice to see you.
[337:42.16]Line it up here.
[337:42.90]A little too high.
[337:47.96]A little too high.
[337:54.95]Over the bathroom window tonight Here
[338:23.58]Got one.
[338:26.28]Have a nice day!
[338:30.92]See you tomorrow!
[338:31.78]Shame time!
[338:38.83]How much does he get paid?
[338:51.83]Nothing.
[338:53.58]He won the scratch-off lottery 25 years ago.
[338:59.97]Dude hit the mega millions.
[339:02.69]He's got nothing else to do.
[339:15.56]This time, let's go for somebody's head.
[339:20.84]Oh, we got an open door.
[339:21.86]Open, open, open, open.
[339:33.77]Just throwing bricks into the house at this point.
[339:39.51]Anybody up there?
[339:45.44]Shit.
[339:57.39]Oh my god, it would have been right in his head.
[340:05.91]Fuck me.
[340:33.92]Hold on.
[340:34.58]Hold on.
[340:35.02]Stay there.
[340:35.80]Come here.
[340:36.08]I need to ask you a very important question.
[340:39.79]You have to stand right in front of me.
[340:40.97]Right here.
[340:41.25]Don't move.
[341:05.29]That was too far to the left.
[341:32.72]I have to do it.
[341:34.60]I ran out of stuff to do in the game, but for some reason I'm not leaving the game.
[341:38.81]I'm still here.
[341:44.27]I haven't left yet.
[341:45.53]I'm done.
[341:47.78]They ran that lady over.
[341:50.78]That's fine.
[341:51.46]I have to get it.
[341:54.00]It's gonna happen.
[341:54.80]You'll see it.
[341:56.28]We can all go, What the heck?
[341:58.62]Oh my god, he did it!
[342:00.75]Perfect.
[342:08.05]Oh my god.
[342:09.03]Oh my god.
[342:20.04]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[342:28.70]Right there.
[342:29.04]Stop.
[342:29.38]Stop.
[342:29.76]Why are you getting so close?
[342:33.12]Some of them keep moving.
[342:39.12]I think that my computer lagged, but yeah.
[343:06.94]Do they have a hurt box?
[343:08.10]Yeah, they do.
[343:14.88]Oh, fuck me.
[343:23.34]Alright, last attempt.
[343:24.50]I'm going to try this one more time.
[343:32.13]I can't go to sleep until you do this.
[343:33.69]I can't go to sleep until I do this.
[343:41.33]That looks good.
[343:41.99]No!
[344:17.07]Oh my god, I can't believe it.
[344:22.46]I got a better idea.
[344:45.26]Block him with the car?
[344:47.20]That's not a bad idea.
[344:49.54]Which way are you gonna go?
[344:50.32]I think I can get this though.
[344:52.64]You just go right there like that.
[344:54.96]This should be it right here.
[345:08.50]Did it land?
[345:09.00]Alright, I'm gonna block him with the car.
[345:16.92]Did anybody hear it?
[345:27.87]No landing sound means hit.
[345:30.85]Alright, well, we're going to have to... We're going to block this.
[345:34.93]I'm sorry, guys.
[345:35.80]If you thought you were going to see something here... The stream's been over for 10-20 minutes.
[345:45.40]I'm just, like, I'm just, like, kind of winding down.
[345:47.26]This is, like, just, like, a me time right now.
[345:49.04]You know what I mean?
[345:49.50]It's just a little me time.
[346:00.50]Alright, where are they?
[346:06.22]Put that away.
[346:07.60]Why am I losing my place right now?
[346:15.62]I'm losing my place.
[346:17.66]They're right here.
[346:18.20]Alright, stay there.
[346:25.14]Stay there.
[346:25.42]Don't move.
[346:28.17]It's like right... It's like right here.
[346:50.32]Oh my god, why?
[346:52.73]That's as close as you could possibly be without a hitting.
[347:39.03]That wasn't even funny.
[347:40.11]It was only funny because his facial expression didn't change.
[347:42.85]At all.
[347:55.02]What am I doing still?
[347:56.68]Why am I still here?
[347:57.47]I haven't- I can't leave!
[347:59.09]I don't think I can leave!
[348:09.07]Ugh.
[348:37.88]Alright, I'm out of here.
[348:38.96]I'm done.
[348:39.44]Hey, thanks for coming to the stream, everybody.
[348:47.59]That was fun.
[348:49.85]Can you crush people?
[348:50.61]No, you can, look, you can, like, hurt people.
[348:55.55]But it's not the way you think.
[348:59.21]People, there's no, nobody dies, nobody gets hurt.
[349:02.65]The mission ends.
[349:06.67]but that was fun thanks everybody for sticking around by the way if you didn't know uh there's a poll that is hanging around here I talked about in the first uh probably five minutes of the stream but this if you could please vote on this poll pick your favorite one for the green screen
[349:30.69]one of these actions you got to pick one for your favorite because there was a lot of meme there was a lot of meme responses and of the 175 different actions uh the top three here are going to be included as well
[349:51.60]So I put the memes in one thing.
[349:53.32]I don't know when it happened.
[349:54.06]I mean, I know what some of this stuff does.
[349:55.72]I mean, I know what, like, the Macarena is.
[349:58.36]I don't know what JoJo poses are.
[350:01.16]I know what the sunglasses is.
[350:02.74]I know what the Sonic run is.
[350:03.86]The John Travolta thing.
[350:04.78]Dark Souls.
[350:06.42]The Bee video.
[350:07.84]I know what these are.
[350:13.10]But... The date for the green screen has changed to Friday.
[350:18.60]So... Friday...
[350:22.24]I figured more people would be able to hang out.
[350:24.52]We could just relax.
[350:26.71]So it's not on a week night.
[350:28.01]Well, Friday is technically a week night, but it's right before the weekend.
[350:30.31]So I figured a lot of you guys would have a little bit easier of a time to hang out and go if you wanted to.
[350:36.71]What time Friday?
[350:37.47]That is the real question.
[350:40.69]It's probably going to be around, I would say, 3 or 4 p.m.
[350:45.64]Eastern.
[350:47.79]That's the thought.
[350:49.89]I don't know the exact time that I'll be in the studio because they're still kind of working that out.
[350:55.85]So it's probably going to be in the afternoon.
[351:02.62]But thank you, everybody, for hanging out.
[351:05.78]I didn't expect to play six hours of Thief Simulator.
[351:10.41]I was really under the impression that I was going to do that and then go play Hitman or go play Deltarune or something.
[351:16.12]But Hitman is out.
[351:19.22]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[351:23.63]So tomorrow, which is Wednesday, we will be playing Hitman 2 or Deltarune.
[351:34.11]One of those two.
[351:36.43]Thief Simulator over Deltarune.
[351:37.94]Well, I did a vote before the stream started and people wanted to see this game.
[351:41.10]I hope you had fun.
[351:43.92]Thanks for sticking around.
[351:47.36]It's getting late, I know, for a lot of you guys, so take care.
[351:50.52]Much love to you.
[351:54.46]But tomorrow, I'll be in the chat hanging out.
[351:56.34]We'll figure out if I'm going to do Hitman or Deltarune.
[351:58.91]Because once I start Hitman, I'm kind of going to play it for at least three or four streams in a row.
[352:06.19]I would assume.
[352:06.97]Because I loved the first one so much.
[352:10.20]So maybe... I don't know.
[352:13.44]Maybe we'll do Deltarune tomorrow.
[352:15.96]And then Hitman after the green screen stream.
[352:18.08]Or Hitman on Thursday.
[352:19.76]But we'll see.
[352:20.76]I've got to figure that out.
[352:21.43]Because I don't have a schedule yet, really.
[352:24.61]But we'll see.
[352:27.17]Vote on that poll.
[352:28.71]I have tons of suggestions.
[352:29.99]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[352:30.89]The green screen stream is set to go on Friday.
[352:35.11]And I will see you guys later.
[352:36.77]And for that, let's go back to earlier today.
[352:41.17]And let's go through the bits.
[352:46.90]Take care, everybody.
[352:48.66]And let's start with the outro, which should have been on already.
[352:53.68]But it wasn't.
[352:55.95]Alright, thank you, Benny To, for the $2.
[352:57.99]Hey, Jerma, I know this is a weird question, but when you and Etalyx wake up, does it happen that both of you guys brush our teeth?
[353:06.94]We do.
[353:07.20]We do brush our teeth every morning, Benny.
[353:08.60]Thanks for the $2.
[353:10.20]FlubbaGut, thanks for the $1.
[353:11.34]Got an interview for an apprenticeship in IT tomorrow at 10am.
[353:14.44]Gotta get my Jerma fix if I'm gonna be confident.
[353:18.14]Good luck to you, FlubbaGut.
[353:24.51]Take care.
[353:24.87]Hopefully it goes well.
[353:25.55]If you're not here anymore, well, we wish you the best.
[353:30.03]MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[353:31.77]To be honest, I only donate to this channel to help Etalyx pay for his house.
[353:37.92]Uh, what?
[353:40.40]That doesn't make any sense.
[353:44.62]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the $1.
[353:46.26]Thank you to BakeMeHome for the $2.
[353:48.34]What games are you looking forward to in 2019?
[353:49.60]Um...
[353:53.87]I mean, Smash Bros.
[353:54.86]comes out in 2018.
[353:58.44]February or March, what was it?
[354:03.10]The FromSoftware game launches in March or February, right?
[354:07.83]Shadows Die Twice.
[354:12.15]Should be awesome.
[354:13.73]Yeah, yes, you can absolutely expect streams of that game.
[354:19.56]Sekiro, yeah, there it is.
[354:22.15]Looking forward to that one.
[354:24.19]But besides that, I'm not really too sure.
[354:25.89]I'd have to take a look at what's coming out.
[354:29.61]Thank you, Devakitty, for the $1.
[354:31.01]Jojo poses aren't a stupid meme thing.
[354:33.09]It's just that Jojo poses are awesome and it would be fun.
[354:36.36]Well, that's up to you guys.
[354:38.30]I'm not going to give an opinion on them.
[354:42.28]But, thank you.
[354:44.86]Hasnain, thanks for the $15, Hasnain.
[354:48.98]$15 from Hasnain, and they say, Zeworldo.
[354:52.29]Zeworldo.
[354:53.99]Zeworldo.
[354:56.45]Thank you.
[354:58.51]Uh... That's a lot of money.
[355:00.37]Thanks a lot.
[355:03.49]Thank you to Good Sir Reginald for the $1.
[355:06.04]That's it.
[355:06.62]Just $1.
[355:07.18]Thank you.
[355:09.16]Manboy, thanks for the $1.
[355:10.54]These are some JoJo poses.
[355:12.08]Have fun making them.
[355:13.44]Yes, sir.
[355:30.29]I'm not gonna do all of these.
[355:32.37]There's like a hundred of these.
[355:36.57]How many of these do I have to do?
[355:37.61]I'm not gonna do them.
[355:45.46]I'll pick out like a few of them, maybe.
[355:48.32]But I'm not that sort of certain that that's what I'm doing, by the way.
[355:50.82]The poll is not even done.
[355:59.93]But anyways, thank you, Manboy.
[356:01.25]That's an interesting thing that I'm about to do in a few days.
[356:05.32]Darkstar, thanks for the $1, Darkstar.
[356:06.86]Can we send you meme videos to watch during bit readings outside of the movie night?
[356:10.81]No.
[356:11.89]I'm going to make that really, really clear that because of the amount of footage and the amount of random stuff, there is way, I can't like pre-screen that stuff unless it's going to be for a specific movie night.
[356:25.39]So outside of that movie night, I'm not going to click on like green screen, Jerma, me in something because I can't pre-screen them.
[356:35.30]And there could be some
[356:36.32]awful shit that I don't want to like show or watch you know what I mean so unfortunately outside of the maybe one or two movie nights that we do it that's going to be kind of that's going to be it how often will movie night be
[356:50.99]Um, I don't have, like, a set time or, you know, duration.
[356:56.02]It's just something I wanted to do.
[356:57.88]We'll see how the first one goes.
[356:59.72]If there's a lot of great submissions, then obviously we'll do it over the course of, you know, a couple of streams, maybe, if it takes that long.
[357:12.03]But, yeah.
[357:12.89]Thank you, Darkstar.
[357:13.57]700,000 games.
[357:15.99]Thank you, SinisterCorn, for the $5.
[357:17.53]SinisterCorn, thanks a lot.
[357:19.19]Hey, Jerm, I'm shitfaced.
[357:20.15]I hope you're not shitfaced.
[357:21.23]Enjoy streaming.
[357:23.41]Uh, not tonight.
[357:24.47]No.
[357:26.33]No wine tonight.
[357:28.72]But, hopefully you enjoyed your night.
[357:30.90]Thanks a lot for the $5, SinisterCorn.
[357:36.24]Uh, GooglyGarret, thanks for the $5.
[357:39.11]Hey Jerma, I missed the Labo bit train, but I just wanted to say thank you again for being the wonderful goofball you are.
[357:44.24]I was super happy you enjoyed my animation and had it put on the second Jerma channel.
[357:49.62]Here's some bits for being so humble.
[357:51.68]Also, I am in a drawing that Snoozing Copter made.
[357:54.23]I thought you would enjoy it.
[357:55.01]Here it is.
[357:55.55]Thanks again for the years of entertainment.
[357:58.13]Uh, thank you, Googly Gareth.
[358:01.65]Uh, your animation was fucking hilarious, so... Absolutely.
[358:10.89]Yeah, let's take a look at this.
[358:14.40]Oh, it's a gif- it's a gif cat!
[358:17.68]Oh, that's awesome.
[358:19.36]Did- have I seen this before?
[358:20.74]I think- I feel like I've seen this.
[358:23.55]If I haven't, then I'm mistaken, but it's awesome.
[358:35.64]The cat police.
[358:40.78]Yeah, the wrong clip.
[358:41.90]Yep.
[358:43.26]It's that.
[358:44.44]Very, very good animation.
[358:47.06]But thank you, Googly Gareth.
[358:52.51]Thanks for sticking around, and thanks for being a very talented animator.
[358:58.75]Because a lot of people enjoyed that.
[359:00.87]I'm one of them.
[359:03.11]Thank you, FlubbaGut for the $1.
[359:03.99]Who the hell leaves stacks of dollars lying around in shelving units?
[359:07.23]Whose house is this?
[359:09.97]I don't know.
[359:11.69]DivUSP, thanks for $3.
[359:13.29]No message.
[359:13.75]Thank you, Div.
[359:15.41]Again, Div, you give pretty much every single stream.
[359:19.75]And although you don't necessarily write messages every single time, thank you.
[359:25.37]I see your name pop up very frequently.
[359:28.63]Sometimes I see you do write stuff, but thank you.
[359:31.33]It means a lot.
[359:35.68]Uh, LSG Icarus, thanks for the two bucks.
[359:37.92]Wait, so pots and pans are worth a normal amount of money in this game, but a laptop costs $52,000.
[359:41.84]Well, that's a hacking laptop.
[359:45.27]He did a special hacking software built into it, so.
[359:48.63]That's, you're paying, you're paying for the brand, you know, it's like Apple.
[359:52.19]It's the same computer, but are you paying $52,000 more money?
[360:06.32]Says the guy that has an iPhone and an iPad.
[360:10.46]Kind of a hypocrite, if you ask me.
[360:13.36]Talking about this guy.
[360:16.10]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers, for the $1.
[360:17.80]Ever think of enabling the BetterTwitch.TV animated emotes like clap so we can applaud when you do cool things?
[360:26.79]Um... I don't even have BetterTwitch.TV. ...
[360:38.72]I have just regular... Not even night mode Twitch.
[360:45.29]I can't see Sour Please.
[360:46.65]No, I don't even know what it is.
[360:49.65]I know it's like a guy dancing.
[360:51.21]That's all I know.
[361:00.72]No, I don't use night mode and I don't have better twitch.tv.
[361:05.66]Guys, remember, remember, this is important, listen.
[361:08.32]I didn't have a custom HUD in Team Fortress.
[361:11.73]I played with just the default minimal HUD.
[361:14.61]I didn't have a custom HUD in World of Warcraft, either.
[361:17.79]I think maybe I had one small change, but I do, I just go default, man.
[361:28.31]Yeah, really.
[361:29.13]That's for real.
[361:30.81]I think I only had a custom HUD in any of these games.
[361:32.91]Maybe one time over the course of a few... Maybe like a month, maybe?
[361:40.10]You can't see my name in light mode.
[361:42.08]I actually can't.
[361:43.58]I can't see that.
[361:44.54]Let me see.
[361:44.86]I have to... I can't see your name?
[361:48.16]I have no idea who you are.
[361:50.38]You're just a mystery person.
[361:51.44]I don't know who you are.
[361:53.88]I can't even, uh... Select and scroll...
[362:03.58]There are people that told me that I had, like, pixels on some of my emotes that weren't erased, and I can't see them because I have light mode on.
[362:13.75]But anyways.
[362:15.23]Thank you, SuperSeal, for the $1.
[362:18.07]Sorry to ruin the good mood, but because you live in Las Vegas, I really should know this.
[362:21.91]Remember to lock all of your doors and windows.
[362:25.88]And, uh... Call the police when you see this man.
[362:32.92]It's just like a claymation thing.
[362:34.20]What is this?
[362:38.32]I don't understand.
[362:39.06]It's just like a claymation thing.
[362:45.59]Thank you, Super Seal.
[362:47.73]Be sure to take care of myself.
[362:51.87]Thank you, It's Sir.
[362:53.17]Thank you, It's Ross Gara.
[362:56.89]Thank you.
[363:00.11]Oh, that was, whoops.
[363:01.51]My bad.
[363:02.97]I make mistakes.
[363:04.41]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the $10.
[363:06.51]ExtraCheesy.
[363:08.87]Swiss's piss and cheddar is better.
[363:10.59]Use this money to get some real cheese.
[363:13.91]I didn't say I hated cheddar.
[363:15.97]When did I say I hated cheddar?
[363:19.03]I like cheddar, okay?
[363:21.01]I like cheddar.
[363:23.35]I just like Swiss a lot.
[363:25.61]But thank you for the ten bucks.
[363:26.59]Extra cheesy.
[363:27.77]Fifteen, actually.
[363:29.33]He says, did you kill them?
[363:31.93]What did I kill?
[363:32.49]I don't know, but thanks for the fifteen dollars.
[363:36.03]Extra cheesy.
[363:37.05]That's a lot of money.
[363:38.25]Enraged Grandpa also gives ten bucks as well.

[364:22.13]When was that?
[364:23.59]Was that Thursday?
[364:27.61]Hey, it's 5 o'clock somewhere in the world.
[364:34.46]As long as you're taking care of yourself, and you're good to go, and you have a few drinks, that's alright.
[364:40.34]There's nothing wrong with that.
[364:42.92]Just, like I said, know your limits.
[364:44.84]Know when it's, like, time to be done.
[364:46.60]And, like, make sure that you take care of yourself.
[364:50.39]You know?
[364:50.67]It's not a big deal.
[365:02.07]And look, remember, some people have different schedules, right?
[365:04.05]So, like, oh, I'm drunk on a Tuesday.
[365:05.71]Well, what if that person has Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday off?

[366:00.68]eefs thanks eefs for the one dollar here I love you Jeremy let me just tell you how fucking stoked I am to get to see you do jojo poses but that's not that's not confirmed yet I mean it's it's currently doing alright in the standings I mean I wouldn't call it great but it's it's doing alright it's not hasn't hasn't won yet it hasn't you know it's still competition is still going
[366:28.24]But I'm going to meme the fuck out of you if you do these poses.
[366:34.86]Some prime real estate poses that I need to do.
[366:37.16]Oh, God.
[366:44.05]I mean, it could lose.
[366:48.84]But if it wins, you know, if it does, it might not.
[366:52.24]Probably not.
[366:52.88]Might not.
[366:55.22]But if it does, then absolutely, I'll take a look at some good ones.
[366:58.66]Thank you, CKLuck, for the $1.
[367:00.72]I'd like to imagine this game is just you and Vinesauce hijinks when you are not streaming.
[367:04.98]Just Vinny telling you to break toilets and steal toasters and paper plates from people's homes.
[367:09.88]Anyway, my point is, how many bits do I need to pay for you and Vinny to rob me?
[367:17.82]Uh... Not... None.
[367:21.97]Okay, I don't want to rob anybody.
[367:26.91]Why no facecam?
[367:29.43]Oh, I just, I don't really play with facecam.
[367:31.72]I have it when it's, I find it to be necessary or when I have something I want to say or something I want to do, but I don't know.
[367:38.52]I typically do not play with facecam.
[367:42.10]You'll see my face plenty though.
[367:45.62]He'll rob you for free.
[367:47.90]Thank you, Flank Tank, for the 10 bucks.
[367:49.40]Hey, Jerm, I haven't had much time to watch the stream live.
[367:51.34]I've been watching the VODs.
[367:52.74]Now that your internet seems to be better fixed, is it safe to say that you love Cox Communications?
[368:00.04]Um, no.
[368:02.66]I mean, if we have this just liquid, lightning liquid internet, and we have like no problems really ever again, then I would be okay with it.
[368:15.48]But it depends.
[368:17.08]Because I didn't drop any frames tonight at all over six plus hours.
[368:21.92]So that's great.
[368:24.50]And remember, because Etalyx is also streaming.
[368:26.44]We stream at the same time.
[368:29.30]So you got two 6,000k bitrates going at the same time.
[368:36.09]And it's been pretty solid.
[368:37.03]So if it stays like this, then we're good.
[368:40.55]So it's good, good, good.
[368:43.59]But thank you, FlankTank.
[368:46.35]Thank you, Warwood, for the one dollar.
[368:47.73]Jerma, come to my house and steal my heart.
[368:49.75]Jerma, disgust.
[368:50.55]Did you smell your savory dog today?
[368:54.77]Well, that was like two completely different statements.
[368:59.41]Well, first of all.
[369:01.27]Second of all.
[369:03.39]No comment.
[369:03.95]I have no comments on this anymore.
[369:07.80]I've made my case.
[369:09.10]I've said my piece.
[369:10.92]You can either agree or disagree that the dog, a dog has like a smelly, sleepy dog smell that just like fills the room when the dog wakes up or moves around.
[369:20.15]And that's, that's on you to, if you want to be on the, you know, understand it.
[369:25.80]The people know what I'm talking about.
[369:29.82]It doesn't matter.
[369:35.46]You sent your piece and smelled your dog.
[369:37.32]Yeah, I have.
[369:40.38]Oh, God.
[369:40.82]Thank you, CK.
[369:42.46]Luck again for $1.
[369:43.54]Please explain the savory dog smell.
[369:45.62]I already did it.
[369:46.56]I've already done it a few times.
[369:48.68]Go back into, like, the fucking history and find it.
[369:53.38]Find me talking about... No, I was, like, drunk.
[369:55.88]But, like, drunk me tried to explain what sober me was trying to... It...
[370:02.29]When you dog, forget it.
[370:04.03]Thanks for the $1.
[370:05.75]Thank you, Unconquerable, for the $1.
[370:09.53]Break all the windows on a house and run.
[370:11.01]Don't bother stealing anything.
[370:12.06]Just be a nuisance.
[370:16.00]I can't even, like, talk about it.
[370:17.82]Because if I start to talk about it, people are going to clip it.
[370:21.38]And it's going to be like, holy shit, he really is insane.
[370:25.42]He wasn't just drinking wine.
[370:30.37]Give your dog a bath?
[370:31.93]I give my dog baths all the time.
[370:38.48]But, thank you.
[370:39.86]Thank you, Unconquerable.

[370:47.86]CKLuck, another one dollar.
[370:49.50]Break the Sink, Kronk.
[370:51.86]Wrong Sink.
[370:56.19]Uh, LinearLinera, thanks for the $2.
[370:58.97]That was so worth it.
[371:00.71]Cheer.
[371:01.33]Thank you.
[371:03.63]Thank you so much.
[371:04.43]Onyx Blaze, thanks for $1.
[371:05.87]Never stop being awesome, please.
[371:09.45]I'm... I'm just me.
[371:12.63]I, uh... I don't have an opinion on it either way.
[371:16.33]I just like to have fun.
[371:17.23]If you are enjoying yourself and you think it's fun, good.
[371:23.50]Then we're both happy.
[371:26.88]Ben Jitsu, thanks for the $7.75.
[371:30.61]They just say, kill me.
[371:32.23]I don't think I will.
[371:35.87]No?
[371:40.95]Thank you for the $7.75.
[371:41.55]No, I'm not going to do that.
[371:48.75]Why would I want to do that?
[371:50.77]You seem like such a swell man.
[371:58.51]Thank you, Hasnain, for the 10 bucks.
[372:04.78]You're gonna kill me with this music.
[372:07.64]Okay, now I understand.
[372:09.21]Now I get it.
[372:10.11]See, Ben with the $7.
[372:11.57]Hasnain with the $10.
[372:13.27]They're talking about the music.
[372:16.21]Okay, I get it.
[372:17.24]I get it.
[372:17.96]Thank you, guys.
[372:20.15]Thank you Hasnain for the 10 bucks.
[372:21.29]Thank you Ben for the $7.75.
[372:22.33]Sorry about the music.
[372:25.03]Sorry about the music guys.
[372:25.99]I'll turn it down.
[372:26.75]The cops came and knocked on the door and I gotta turn the music down for the party.
[372:31.46]Imagine hearing that blast from your neighbor's house.
[372:34.68]Spongebob or fucking house remix.
[372:40.18]Thank you The Green Goo.
[372:43.72]Sell your shirt.
[372:45.36]Uh, no.
[372:47.10]Tavares.
[372:47.60]Thanks Tavares for the $1.
[372:48.78]Someone stop him.
[372:51.50]Thank you Stix Renegade for the $2.24.
[372:53.20]This song might ruin your childhood.
[372:56.29]The original Willy Wonka was trash anyway.
[372:58.57]2005 Willy Wonka for life.
[373:03.39]Oh, man.
[373:06.57]That's just... That's just not... That's just not correct.
[373:14.82]You know?
[373:16.88]I just don't think that's correct.
[373:23.09]That's not correct, right?
[373:24.75]You would get a red X on that problem if it was in a school or something, right?
[373:30.95]It'd be like X and minus 10 points.
[373:35.15]I just don't think that's correct.
[373:38.11]But thank you.
[373:38.57]I mean, I appreciate the $2.25 and I obviously respect your opinion on the matter, but I just don't think it's correct.
[373:48.92]Hey, Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[373:50.16]Thanks to you, I developed a new kind of paranoia.
[373:52.49]I now can't listen to any music without fearing it would suddenly turn into dubstep.
[373:56.59]I'm sorry that I had something to do with that.
[374:03.06]Mostly lost.
[374:03.66]Thanks for the $1.
[374:04.44]That autoplay was the greatest 10 minutes of streaming history.
[374:07.94]I don't know.
[374:08.40]I don't know.
[374:09.16]It was fun, but I don't know about that.
[374:12.98]The greatest 10 minutes of streaming history, I think, is when the dog was rolling around and peeing.
[374:17.31]The guy was walking a dog in his own house for The Sims.
[374:22.71]That was the most I've ever... My whole body hurt after that.
[374:26.76]Just the way that he was walking.
[374:27.78]He was on drugs walking his dog in his house.
[374:30.86]And the dog was rolling around and peeing.
[374:33.80]I don't think I'll ever be able to laugh that hard at anything.
[374:36.46]I really don't think so.
[374:40.27]That may have been one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
[374:45.96]I don't know.
[374:47.00]That's tricky.
[374:53.86]I'm thinking about it right now.
[374:57.89]Just like, drugs mod.
[375:04.08]Uh...
[375:07.13]But, thank you.
[375:08.79]Thank you, Bet3, for the $5.
[375:10.45]Bet3, Doom, OST, or Riot.
[375:12.09]I already played it.
[375:13.79]But thank you for the feedback.
[375:16.97]DinoDan, thanks for the $1.
[375:18.28]This stream was the hardest I've laughed in quite some time.
[375:20.10]Thanks for always cheering me up.
[375:22.64]Thank you.
[375:23.00]I'm happy you think that.
[375:25.88]I'm glad you have fun.
[375:27.88]I had fun, too.
[375:31.08]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[375:32.30]After that shit show, I feel like we need to cleanse ourselves.
[375:34.22]So here's some... Some... What is this?
[375:41.80]Cowboy Bebop.
[375:44.96]This is Yoko Kanno.
[375:58.53]Oh, I know this song.
[376:05.79]Aren't they doing, like, a Cowboy Bebop again?
[376:08.33]Aren't they redoing it or something?
[376:10.75]They're remaking Cowboy Bebop, aren't they?
[376:14.57]Or a movie, or... What are they doing?
[376:17.25]They're doing something.
[376:19.91]Thank you, Son of Jenova.
[376:21.57]Thank you, Bet3, again, for the $5.
[376:23.69]Thank you, Jerma.
[376:24.13]This is perfect.
[376:24.75]Jerma Hart.
[376:26.55]Thank you, Bet3.
[376:29.15]I hope not.
[376:32.53]On Netflix?
[376:33.27]Is that what it was?
[376:38.51]That'd be weird, I guess.
[376:40.73]Thank you, Bet3.
[376:41.49]Thank you, CJ the Dog, for the $1.
[376:42.85]Jeremiah, I just want you to know that the autoplay music bit was one of the funniest things I've ever watched.

[376:49.59]Hold on.
[376:50.73]My brain.
[376:51.09]I want you to know that the autoplay music bit was one of, if not the funniest things I've ever watched.
[376:56.61]I was legit cry laughing.
[376:57.86]Thank you so much for being an amazing entertainer.
[377:01.28]I mean, you can think like the random...
[377:04.38]autoplay because I I had nothing to do with that it just was playing them I clicked on one pink panther remix so uh that's all like Google's computers but thank you appreciate that I had a lot of fun bet three thanks to the five dollars in all seriousness thanks for such a fun stream tiptoe through the tulips and live in the sunlight Jerma
[377:34.55]will do.
[377:35.73]Thank you, Bet3.
[377:38.78]Tuscore, thank you for the $1.25.
[377:41.22]You should stream this game during December and face Kim in a full $800 Grinch costume.
[377:57.44]Thank you, GamingHash, for the $2.70. $2.70.
[378:02.55]Love your streams, but don't have much time to watch them.
[378:04.79]Keep up the good work.
[378:06.89]Thank you for the nearly $3 gaming hash.
[378:10.47]Man, thanks for stopping in.
[378:12.79]Good to see you.
[378:13.37]Thank you.
[378:17.00]Thank you, Drosophilia, for the $1.
[378:20.16]Up, cup, sup, pup, jup.
[378:25.48]No, but you don't understand.
[378:29.74]It's not...
[378:31.91]It that's not how that word is said It's not oop coop soup poop It's up Jupiter Jupiter Jupiter Jupiter Jupiter Jupiter Just because another word has it up doesn't mean it's pronounced the same way I
[378:57.04]Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter.
[378:58.65]Steel, Jupiter.
[379:00.21]Steel, Jupiter.
[379:01.93]Jupiter, Jupiter.
[379:03.05]Steel, Jupiter.
[379:05.12]Steel, China.
[379:06.32]Steel, China.
[379:07.48]Steel, Jupiter.
[379:08.36]Just say it a few times, you'll get it.
[379:16.44]Smacklesmore, thanks for the $1.
[379:17.78]Hey Jerma, thanks for all the great streams.
[379:19.04]This one in particular left me violently cry laughing several times.
[379:22.51]Also, the lockpicking in this game is pretty realistic.
[379:24.51]I know because I had to do it when I got trapped in a walk-in oven.
[379:27.77]Sorry to hear that.
[379:28.47]Thank you, Smacklesmore, for the $1.
[379:30.08]Thank you, Devakitty, for the $1.
[379:33.63]Uh, jokes aside, uh, finder keepers has no legal merit.
[379:38.01]Legally speaking, any stolen or lost object you find, if a judge deems that you didn't go through reasonable steps to find the owner, it's theft by finding.
[379:46.38]Of course, if you find $20 on the ground, I hardly doubt the people will call the cops on you, but otherwise you'll have committed a crime.
[379:53.85]Finders keepers has no legal merit.
[379:56.81]But, okay, legally speaking, if you find an object on the ground, and you didn't reasonably try to find the owner, so if you find a briefcase on the side of the road with 10 grand in it, are you going to put up flyers on the highway?
[380:11.51]Found 10 grand.
[380:13.25]Please call me.
[380:14.23]Hey, 10 grand, that's mine.
[380:18.41]Hey, did you find 10 grand?
[380:19.41]It's my 10 grand.
[380:25.45]How are you going to do that?
[380:27.77]Your phone's going to ring off the hook all day.
[380:29.32]Hey, I heard you found 10 grand.
[380:33.08]Oh, yeah, I was driving down the road.
[380:34.66]It fell out of my pocket.
[380:36.18]Oh, shit.
[380:36.94]Can I come get it?
[380:37.50]You have to ask him how much money it is.
[380:46.77]You can't just put all the cards out right at the beginning.
[380:52.03]To say lost briefcase.
[381:07.04]Lost briefcase.
[381:09.48]Yeah, but okay.
[381:10.18]So on that flyer, you're just going to write, I found a lost briefcase.
[381:16.12]You know how many people lose their briefcases every day?
[381:20.51]People that fly on airlines right now lost their briefcase today.
[381:27.03]Of like the 50,000 people that lost their luggage this afternoon, who's gonna call you?
[381:39.52]But on the side of a highway.
[381:41.40]Yeah, but I mean, you could just... Take away the side of the highway.
[381:53.33]When they call, you ask what's in it.
[381:55.99]But what if they guess?
[381:59.43]Like, what if it was 10 grand and something else?
[382:01.37]And the guy's like, Oh, yeah, I feel like you may have found my briefcase.
[382:06.14]Well, I had $10,000 in that briefcase.
[382:09.88]And a Mega Man sticker.
[382:12.12]And he's just taking a wild fucking guess.
[382:13.66]And there's a Mega Man sticker in there.
[382:15.32]But it's like, fuck, man.
[382:17.00]Could he have guessed?
[382:17.92]What?
[382:25.72]Then it's his.
[382:26.46]No, I'd be the guy, I'd be the guy opening the door, even with like, even with the most... Hey, hold on.
[382:37.46]Even with like the most fucking evidence, when that doorbell rings, you bet your ass I'm gonna be the guy going like this.
[382:49.21]Like... Here.
[382:52.71]Like I'm holding the briefcase right here, ready?
[382:56.03]So like, I'm going to answer the door.
[382:57.45]It's going to be like, I'm going to answer the door with a briefcase like this, like.
[383:01.87]Hey, what's up, man?
[383:02.85]You sure this is yours?
[383:03.54]Like, I'm going to be fucking holding it.
[383:05.32]Because I don't know.
[383:05.94]He's going to try to rip it out of my fucking hands.
[383:08.42]Like, I'm going to hold it tight like this.
[383:10.24]Like that.
[383:11.20]Like, hey, what's up, dude?
[383:12.52]No, I'm going to go under this shirt.
[383:13.62]It's going to be like this.
[383:15.28]Like, hey, man.
[383:16.38]What's up?
[383:16.64]But I'm going to be holding it with two hands.
[383:18.42]Hey, what's up, dude?
[383:19.00]So you're looking for your... What are you looking for again?
[383:22.08]Oh, my briefcase.
[383:23.40]Briefcase.
[383:23.72]Well, with a sticker on there.
[383:25.74]What's the sticker?
[383:28.19]And, like, I'm gonna make sure he doesn't fucking just grab it.
[383:30.23]Somebody gets to come ring your doorbell and fucking come punch you in the face and run out with it.
[383:41.16]Hey, ever heard of a razor?
[383:42.20]You have to write your name on every single dollar.
[383:51.29]Handcuff it to your wrist.
[383:57.84]I'm gonna do an experiment.
[383:58.84]I'm gonna... No, never mind.
[384:00.44]I can't, like, say this.
[384:02.04]But, like... Wouldn't it be funny if... All joking here, but wouldn't it be funny if this joke I'm about to say... Like, if I just put... Like, a thousand dollars in a briefcase.
[384:15.77]And put it on the side of a road.
[384:18.21]And... Just say what happened.
[384:21.04]You know what I mean?
[384:24.82]Put flyers up and shit.
[384:29.20]That's a social experiment?
[384:31.14]Yeah, I'm not going to do one of those.
[384:33.96]It would get stolen.
[384:45.07]We'd be like staked out, like camped out, watching it.
[384:48.33]Like, oh shit, here comes a car.
[384:50.27]He's pulling up.
[384:51.31]Oh man, what's he going to do?
[384:52.93]There's a grand in that brief.
[384:54.08]He has a fucking cash.
[384:56.52]He's looking at it.
[384:57.56]He's opening it up.
[384:59.81]Okay, man.
[385:00.37]He's scooping out all the cash.
[385:03.61]Yeah, I think he's gonna go.
[385:05.55]He's going through the briefcase as hard as he could into the woods.
[385:10.00]All the money just went into his pocket.
[385:12.32]Okay, but like, hold on.
[385:14.94]He's in the car.
[385:15.48]He's stepping on the gas.
[385:17.88]He's gone.
[385:18.94]That guy's gone.
[385:19.44]And that would be it.
[385:21.73]That'd be the whole thing.
[385:27.03]Why wouldn't he take the case with you?
[385:29.21]Because, like, you don't want the evidence.
[385:33.80]How do I know he's stepping on the gas?
[385:35.04]Because his car peels out and he fucking goes 80 miles per hour on the highway.
[385:44.48]I wonder what would happen.
[385:45.98]You would just lose a grant.
[385:53.59]Put a GPS in it?
[385:54.95]Yeah, but then, like, yeah, I guess.
[386:01.83]that'd be funny just for like a skit we're gonna do a social experiment we try to find out what happens if somebody finds ten thousand dollars in a briefcase and they just fucking take it and that's it but moving on no country for old men ah
[386:30.56]Thank you to Sferg, Sferg, for the three bucks.
[386:36.26]Don't forget to report this.
[386:39.83]Wait, what?
[386:46.77]Don't forget to report this.
[386:47.89]What am I reporting?
[386:49.50]Oh, oh, right, right, sorry.
[386:50.88]Thank you.
[386:55.48]I gotta remember the things I said four hours ago.
[387:01.21]Thank you to Genieboy for the one dollar.
[387:03.49]My boy, Jerma, likes lo-fi.
[387:10.33]Lo-fi, like Wi-Fi?
[387:14.36]Like Wi-Fi, but not Wi-Fi.
[387:16.82]Like the shitty version of Wi-Fi.
[387:22.44]It's music.
[387:25.46]Oh.
[387:32.08]Boomer.
[387:35.10]My life is completing itself one brick at a time.
[387:37.63]Jerma nose boy.
[387:38.49]Thank you.
[387:40.01]Thank you, smelly boy, for the $1.
[387:41.59]Hey, can you make a separate channel on Discord for history and philosophical talk?
[387:47.75]Uh, no.
[387:49.88]No, you know how fast that would get derailed in like 30 minutes?
[387:58.76]Why?
[387:59.08]That would just get derailed.
[388:06.29]The history channel?
[388:11.03]Fuck it.
[388:13.07]Oh, fuck.
[388:16.18]Oh, god damn it.
[388:19.38]No, no, it's not going to be a history discussion philosophical channel.
[388:32.42]Make an IQ test so certain people wouldn't be able to get in the channel.
[388:35.64]Well, I would probably not be able to get in.
[388:37.92]On my own channel, on my own, like, officially send it, like, done Discord.
[388:48.67]Perfect.
[388:51.89]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers, for the $1.
[388:53.59]Hey, Jerma, it is of most importance that you, in chat, watch this video.
[388:58.69]If it's a gnome, I'm going to turn off the stream.
[389:05.77]Okay, just checking.
[389:14.58]It's just a cat.
[389:18.20]What is going on here?
[389:22.56]It's his wedding video.
[389:23.62]It's not his wedding video.
[389:24.69]It's like a... I don't even know what that is.
[389:27.91]Thank you for the cat video.
[389:38.99]We need a Garfield emote.
[389:41.01]No, we do not need a Garfield emote.
[389:44.43]Thank you for real dough for the $1.
[389:45.93]I highly recommend you do a stream of the You Testament.
[389:48.97]It's a game where you can make a character and fuck around in Jesus' time.
[389:53.86]Also, watch this video.
[389:55.36]Don't you know the rules?
[390:02.29]This is a tiny URL link.
[390:08.16]Is that like a YouTube video?
[390:18.23]Virus, virus, virus, virus.
[390:22.07]Thank you for real though, for the...
[390:28.20]It's $1.
[390:30.46]It's more of a compact URL.
[390:32.40]Hey, thank you, Evan the Newbie, for the $1 steal.
[390:35.43]The frame rate.
[390:36.25]That was really weird.
[390:37.25]I know exactly what you're talking about.
[390:40.83]Darkstar, thanks for the $1, Darkstar.
[390:43.03]700,000 games.
[390:43.55]Forgetful grocery list burglar for next Jerma Rumble.
[390:48.90]You will see a Jerma Rumble here before the end of the year.
[390:50.82]I can promise you that.
[390:53.00]I'm going to try to make as many characters ever that I've ever made.
[390:56.26]It's going to be the most characters ever made.
[391:01.18]Everyone is here.
[391:02.08]You know what I'm saying?
[391:04.72]Everyone is here.
[391:07.18]Just kidding, though, because I'm not making like 150 characters.
[391:10.02]That'll take me like six weeks.
[391:18.36]Thank you, Cardamom, for the $1.
[391:20.80]I wish this was a movie.
[391:24.72]It's a reddit post, uh, JermaPlaysThiefSimulator, steal the China.
[391:31.71]November 13th.
[391:32.29]That's, that's, that's the pink panther.
[391:44.03]Thank you, Cardamom.
[391:44.85]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer!
[391:48.98]Uh, it's long, so no Garfagraph.
[391:50.94]Jeff's, uh, jermaMustard.
[391:56.49]Let's take a look.
[391:59.47]This is Garfield with... Those are other... I don't know.
[392:02.09]Those are not Garfield.
[392:04.81]Garf's coming in here with the bits and a Garfograph.
[392:06.95]I paid the toll.
[392:07.61]It's time to troll.
[392:09.43]Good evening, ladies and germs.
[392:10.57]Looking good.
[392:11.83]Spectag.
[392:13.97]Somebody hit him in the head and he's bleeding.
[392:16.17]Somebody fucking threw a rock at his head and it fucking collapsed his skull.
[392:22.44]What's next here?
[392:23.90]Dermot's playing Thief Simulator, huh?
[392:25.18]Why not play a good game and play some of that Sly Cooper action, huh?
[392:29.37]Oh, custard pie.
[392:30.13]Too bad my favorite flavor is mustard pie.
[392:33.21]People are just throwing shit.
[392:35.87]Anyways, folks, you've got plenty of funny garfographs in store.
[392:38.29]There's no shortage of my garftastic bits.
[392:40.05]Be sure not to OD on them, though.
[392:42.81]Yes, yes, I snuck in a bit of PG-13 there.
[392:44.77]It was naughty.
[392:46.34]Alright, see you around, chat.
[392:48.36]You've been a great crowd.
[392:51.20]So, Garfield, I assume tonight was actually one of your better garfagrabs.
[392:54.94]It went fantastically.
[392:55.86]They didn't even break out the firearms and pitchforks this time.
[393:02.12]You should, like, send these to Garfield Enterprises.
[393:05.48]See if you can be a Garfield writer.
[393:07.26]Burn in hell, cat.
[393:13.70]Thank you.
[393:14.74]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer, for your comic book.
[393:25.60]Jesus.
[393:31.02]Oh, you guys are fucking hilarious.
[393:33.28]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[393:34.52]Darkstar, 700,000 games.
[393:36.12]Enough.
[393:37.24]Even though the cough, absolutely idiotic cough Jojo poses are going to potentially not... It could be up in the air, the poll.
[393:46.11]I would like to see a more elaborate bee snap.
[393:50.05]That's on the poll.
[393:50.85]I mean, there's a few things on the poll.
[393:55.27]Does Garfield steal the China?
[393:58.84]I don't think Garfield steals the China.
[394:02.02]Not yet.
[394:02.40]What do you mean, not yet?
[394:04.28]That's not like a movie.
[394:05.10]That's not a thing.
[394:05.78]Why am I, like, trying... That's not a thing.
[394:08.16]No, not yet.
[394:11.09]Thank you, Unconquerable, for the one dollar.
[394:13.05]German95, hey, I donated before, but I'm doing so again.
[394:16.69]I'm really impressed with how interactive you are with your stream.
[394:19.67]I can't wait to see what's next.
[394:20.63]Have a great night.
[394:21.31]Ugly streamer.
[394:23.33]Also, while I'm here, take some more of my money with a sub.
[394:27.14]Thanks a lot, Unconquer-a-bee.
[394:32.30]Thank you.
[394:34.10]Um...
[394:38.15]Look, sometimes chat, you know, chat gives it to me.
[394:40.35]I give it to chat.
[394:41.73]We go back and forth.
[394:43.79]We talk a little shit.
[394:44.59]We have a little fun.
[394:45.47]We fucking do stuff.
[394:49.27]These streams, I love them.
[394:51.94]As long as you're having fun, I'm having fun, then we're all having fun.
[394:59.64]Why are you talking shit to your chat?
[395:01.04]No, I'm not.
[395:04.28]I'm just saying we go back and forth.
[395:06.34]We have a little bit of fun.
[395:08.78]You know, some people call me ugly.
[395:11.50]You know, some people call me ugly.
[395:13.68]I know they're just messing around with me.
[395:15.41]Yeah, I did have it right.
[395:23.37]You are.
[395:24.27]Okay, so you can call me ugly, but I can't be like, my DPI sucks.
[395:31.87]That has nothing to do with you.
[395:33.11]That's me complaining about my mouse.
[395:36.43]I never like say anything mean to you guys.
[395:38.39]What?
[395:47.03]But thank you.
[395:48.99]So here's a little to make up for that.
[395:50.43]Well, thank you, HoneyChain, for your $4.30.
[396:10.52]He just said I should burn in hell.
[396:12.02]I didn't say that.
[396:13.26]I saw it pop up in the chat and my... fucking cat person brain decided just to say it.
[396:24.07]My squirrel brain decided it was gonna say it.
[396:27.71]So I didn't say it.
[396:34.71]But thank you, HoneyChain, for the $4.30.
[396:38.14]Hey, Nightfang, thanks for $1.
[396:39.60]If you need help with JoJo poses, watch this video.
[396:45.66]JoJo, everyone is already assuming that JoJo... I'm not going to stop saying the word JoJo.
[396:52.33]I'm going to start calling it like... I'm going to start calling it Doki Doki.
[396:56.87]People so badly think that Doki Doki is going to win.
[397:00.23]Not so sure.
[397:01.17]Still another day.
[397:06.72]Hey, Valuki!
[397:07.96]Thanks, Valuki, for the one dollar.
[397:09.18]Yo, Jerm, our D&D session was Sunday, and basically the Castle Griffinsteed arc takes 20 years after Carl went in.
[397:16.77]No one has heard from him ever since, and Elvenwood's next champion is a brute named Trog.
[397:21.73]He yells his own name when he's hurt and runs into battle.
[397:24.17]We ended up going by the abandoned wagon.
[397:26.77]That was a big mistake.
[397:28.17]And had to fight a giant rat deeper in the dungeon.
[397:31.23]We got to Al'Goro.
[397:32.11]He was a real boss instead of a one-shot.
[397:34.29]And Trog ended up dying because he ran in headfirst like he always does.
[397:38.16]We'll keep you updated.
[397:40.66]Well, you gotta stay away from that wagon.
[397:44.66]Did you touch the wagon?
[397:45.90]That's probably what happened.
[397:49.80]But I'm glad your session went well.
[397:52.02]That sounds like a lot of fun.
[397:54.84]Thank you, Beluki.
[397:56.77]Thank you, Endoxin.
[398:32.80]Thank you, Thevious, for the two bucks.
[398:35.88]This is for the upcoming grand reveal of your stand-up power, stand-o power, during the green screen.
[398:44.35]And he goes, Vry.
[398:48.13]Why?
[398:50.15]Vry?
[398:52.21]W-R?
[398:52.63]I don't get it.
[398:53.65]I don't understand.
[398:57.89]I'm sorry, I meant the elephant green screen.
[399:00.26]Anyway, look, elephant.
[399:05.75]Elephant green screen.
[399:07.77]There's no elephant on there.
[399:09.25]I don't have like a $12,000 animal surprise for you guys.
[399:13.77]I'm going to ride into the studio on an elephant.
[399:22.42]Thank you, the Orange Pyro Ranger, for the $1.
[399:24.72]I hope you're not too overwhelmed by the JoJo poses.
[399:30.26]You know, maybe I'll just veto the JoJo poses and put Dab back on the list.
[399:38.67]Everyone's so convinced.
[399:47.26]Nah, I already did my veto choices.
[399:50.08]Can't go back on them now.
[399:51.30]Just as long as I don't have to do the gnome video.
[400:04.29]I would rather, like,
[400:07.81]I would rather get a bad burn than recreate the gnome video.
[400:16.94]I would rather fall off a bike going 15 miles per hour than recreate the gnome video.
[400:36.13]Just do that.
[400:39.17]If I had the option, you can either recreate the whole gnome video or hold the handlebars and let the wheels spin downhill and intentionally fall over on the bike.
[400:51.07]I'd be like, oh, well, I'll be okay in a few days.
[400:55.45]Like it would probably take like maybe a week or two of recovery.
[400:58.63]Then my bones would heal.
[401:01.13]But I would never be able to get rid of people making me a gnome in the gnome video.
[401:06.76]That would last forever.
[401:07.88]That would last for life.
[401:11.57]Bones heal, man.
[401:21.64]Haha, Jeremy fell off a bike.
[401:26.56]But, thank you.
[401:27.24]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, again, for $1 here.
[401:29.39]Jeremy, you are the first person I ever gave virtual currency to.
[401:32.87]Is Steal the China the new toy boat?
[401:38.15]Well, Steal the China is not a tongue twister.
[401:41.42]Steal the China is a painting.
[401:43.72]Steal the China is what you chant when you're breaking into a person's house that has that painting.
[401:48.66]It's the only time it's useful.
[401:53.87]Thank you.
[401:56.25]Hey, Broluck, thanks for the $5.
[401:57.11]Hey, mate, feeling pretty hungry, but only had like $10 left in my bank account.
[402:01.12]Have it.
[402:03.20]Why would you give me half of that?
[402:04.16]Go get, like, food.
[402:05.95]Hey, mate.
[402:06.37]Feeling pretty hungry, but only had $10 left in my bank account.
[402:08.73]Have it.
[402:12.39]You can have it.
[402:14.82]You can eat.
[402:15.44]Go.
[402:15.52]You can eat something.
[402:16.06]Don't... Take care of yourself first.
[402:19.12]But thank you.
[402:21.28]Devakitty, thanks for the $1.
[402:22.82]They say UWU Glumps.
[402:26.72]Glumps.
[402:27.52]And there's two asterisks next to it.
[402:30.39]Thank you.
[402:31.69]Cosmic Moses, thanks for the $1.
[402:33.29]Thank you for attempting to reenact this scene for almost an hour.
[402:44.62]For recreating this scene.
[402:55.48]It's funny you mention that because me and my brother, that's from Home Alone, me and my brother used to rewind the VHS and watch that part over and over again because we thought it was the funniest part in the whole movie.
[403:08.46]He just whips as hard as he can.
[403:10.55]It's the only time in any of the two movies that there's ever a real violent retaliation to Kevin McAllister, who is, you know, the main character.
[403:22.87]The only point in the whole movie.
[403:24.91]And he's trying to hit him with a brick in the fucking head as hard as he can.
[403:30.19]He throws it down as hard as he can.
[403:36.35]Like, he's trying to kill Kevin McCallister here.
[403:40.71]Suck brick, kid!
[403:44.67]Like, if that... He would have just killed Kevin.
[403:47.51]That brick would have hit him right in the fucking face.
[403:53.80]They say they're going to kill him the whole movie.
[403:55.22]Yeah, they go like... Oh, get that kid and I'm going to kill him right here, right here, right here.
[404:04.11]but never is there any real violent retaliation like there is here.
[404:13.60]If you haven't seen that movie in a long time, count the amount of times that Joe Pesci says razza frazza.
[404:20.03]Marv is the real psycho.
[404:35.00]Just like the cartoon gibberish that Yosemite Sam used to do.
[404:42.90]But, yes.
[404:44.06]That cosmic mosaic, that is a great scene.
[404:48.61]Hold on.
[404:49.85]That's a great movie.
[404:50.99]It's a very funny movie.
[404:56.81]That's a great scene.
[405:01.68]Never mind.
[405:02.96]Thank you to Broluck again.
[405:05.38]Gave $10 total.
[405:06.46]Broluck, what the heck, man?
[405:09.26]I'd like to have a laid-back chat, but the obvious apply here.
[405:12.04]No racism or bigotry.
[405:13.64]Don't talk about politics and just try not to be a psycho.
[405:18.02]Yeah.
[405:19.45]Copy and paste that for the rules of the green screen stream.
[405:30.01]Those are the rules there.
[405:35.16]Garfield the Monday killer click here to find out with $1 sniff sniff.
[405:38.64]That's odd.
[405:39.20]Okay, is there there is a savory dog smell Sorry, I ever doubted you, right?
[405:44.43]Well, what I what you didn't know was that all dogs are actually Eldritch horrors with hypnotic sense Make humans to come to their will anyways, where's my ten bucks?
[405:59.38]I hope he does the meme dances from TikTok.
[406:01.90]I'm not doing any meme dances.
[406:04.36]They've already been taken off the table completely.
[406:08.01]They've already been vetoed.
[406:08.85]They've been pre-vetoed.
[406:10.51]Even before I pre-vetoed them, they were deleted.
[406:12.47]I don't even know what that is, but I'm not doing it.
[406:19.13]And finally, Elizabeth, thank you for the $1.
[406:20.97]Suck a brick out of my ass.
[406:23.75]It sounds like it would be very, very uncomfortable.
[406:27.97]Thank you for the $1, though.
[406:30.23]And now we're going to go through the credits.
[406:35.65]Let's see.
[406:36.25]The bunch of people tonight that subbed and resubbed.
[406:39.81]There was gifted subs, too.
[406:41.73]All of you are fucking incredible.
[406:43.09]Thank you, all of you.
[406:49.30]If you don't know, yes, green screen is happening on Friday.
[406:53.43]Not Thursday.
[406:53.99]I want more people to be able to participate.
[406:56.13]Tomorrow, Deltarune or Hitman.
[406:58.71]One of those two things.
[407:00.11]Thursday, Deltarune or Hitman.
[407:01.77]Whatever we don't do on Wednesday, we'll do on Thursday.
[407:04.89]Friday, green screen stream.
[407:08.55]Saturday, nothing.
[407:10.58]Sunday, nothing.
[407:12.50]Monday, we're back.
[407:16.67]We'll see.
[407:17.29]Or maybe I'll stream on Sunday.
[407:19.67]Maybe we'll continue Hitman on Sunday.
[407:27.72]Jerma, you're literally the last of my gaming channel subs that I consistently watch.
[407:37.28]I'm glad you're here.
[407:42.04]I'm happy that you've been able to watch for this long.
[407:46.85]I can't keep up with all the VODs.
[407:49.53]I know, I've been streaming a lot.
[407:52.23]And these streams have been going a long time, too.
[407:54.85]But I told you guys, I came back.
[408:00.31]I wasn't able to stream for three straight weeks.
[408:03.61]And I wanted to go.
[408:05.23]We've been doing a lot of seven, eight, nine hour streams the last couple weeks here.
[408:10.61]And I'm all for it.
[408:12.64]I'm having a great time.
[408:14.58]It's good to be back.
[408:22.37]Jeremiah, on a scale of 1 to 10, how many apples have you eaten in the past 2 years?
[408:26.43]Uh, probably like 80.
[408:28.09]No, that's not even true.
[408:30.32]Would it be like 2?
[408:32.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[408:32.96]More than that.
[408:34.14]I'm gonna say like 15.
[408:36.18]No, like 25.
[408:39.62]Ask about the Dreamcast.
[408:41.28]I still have it.
[408:42.32]I still have the Dreamcast.
[408:43.46]I still have the PlayStation 2 back here.
[408:45.37]I made sure that they got to Vegas.
[408:47.67]So, they're still here.
[408:50.42]Once the dust settles and all these brand new holiday releases, we will go back.
[408:54.80]We'll do a ton of Dreamcast stuff.
[408:56.18]We'll finish the PlayStation 2 stuff.

[409:06.97]Smash Brothers.
[409:15.45]Deltarune.

[409:17.13]But there's a lot of games that are coming out.
[409:26.11]Am I gonna play Smash Bros.
[409:27.13]with fans?
[409:28.03]Is Nintendo's online policy?
[409:30.71]Hey, can you just jump into random lobbies?
[409:32.71]Or do you still need to give people like a 500-digit friend code?
[409:37.47]Because I'll do whatever I can.
[409:39.19]I mean, I was planning on playing it with as many people as I wanted to.
[409:41.51]Uh, what are you guys doing?
[409:51.54]Why are you guys spelling quest?
[409:55.48]But that is it.
[409:56.72]Thank you.

[409:59.52]Thank you so much, everybody, for your continued monetary support of the channel.
[410:05.52]You guys are fucking amazing.

[410:13.04]It's this one.

[410:17.77]It's actually, actually pretty relevant.
[410:20.01]So, I'll give that one to you.
[410:21.33]That's pretty good.
[410:22.83]And, Elizabeth, thanks for the $1.

[410:25.60]Did you see this?

[410:29.66]He was confused.
[410:32.12]Spent a little time in his dryer.

[411:18.76]See you guys soon.
[411:20.81]Have a great one.
