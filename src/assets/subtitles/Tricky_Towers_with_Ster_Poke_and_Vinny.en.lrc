[00:00.91]Tricky Towers.
[00:03.01]Let's do that right now.
[00:03.73]We can do Lego another day.
[00:05.75]Yeah, I already bought Lego.
[00:07.04]Yeah, we'll do Lego.
[00:08.96]We'll do Lego and Crime.
[00:12.36]Okay.
[00:13.06]Yeah, that sounds good for a future occasion.
[00:18.85]And then Ark Raiders when it comes out.
[00:23.00]We're definitely all playing around with that.
[00:25.06]Okay.
[00:26.08]What is Ark Raiders?
[00:26.96]Oh, wait.
[00:27.20]Yeah, I kind of know what that is.
[00:28.50]Hang on a minute.
[00:28.94]Is that like...
[00:31.10]It's a game everyone's going to play.
[00:33.10]It's like a... Isn't it three people, though?
[00:36.95]Oh, you're right.
[00:37.67]Frick.
[00:39.43]Yeah.
[00:39.75]We'll do it when Germany's busy.
[00:41.16]We'll do our three men.
[00:53.07]Apparently, LEGO has shorter rounds, too.
[00:58.64]There's a shorter 30 minute match mode.
[01:01.06]So that's also a thing, but I've already also bought tricky towers.
[01:07.01]Our graders looks pretty good though.
[01:19.43]I'm like, I'm glad that's happening after October though.
[01:22.87]Like, like November.
[01:24.78]Cause by then I'll have more time.
[01:27.44]I'm trying.
[01:41.59]yes oh oh oh uh poke you like VR did you play the alien VR game I am back I am back hello we all changed our you changed your mind as their minds uh we'll do lego another time okay towers we're gonna play tricky towers
[02:12.79]Okay, hold on.
[02:13.67]Let me change that.
[02:20.11]That'll be cool.
[02:25.36]I think as I'm downloading a game, I'm lagging out my stream.
[02:28.15]So give me a second.
[02:32.16]That's my favorite song, guys.
[02:40.77]That was... My prom was to that song.
[02:54.44]It's only a little loud.
[02:58.81]Okay.
[02:59.49]I should be ready to go.
[03:12.56]You said it was loud?
[03:13.62]I opened Tricky Towers.
[03:18.83]What, like barely audible unplugged guitar?
[03:21.95]Yeah.
[03:24.91]You're like, wow, what low budget music this is.
[03:41.29]It's terrible.
[03:43.84]It's a B chord over and over and over again.
[03:48.37]One of my favorite music.
[03:59.48]I should be loading it.
[03:59.96]Holy shit, it is loud.
[04:00.43]The towers get tricky and you gotta build your towers.
[04:03.07]It is so loud.
[04:03.93]I always get tricky and you gotta build your towers.
[04:07.27]You're gonna get long in...
[04:10.03]your hours if you don't get tricky.
[04:12.20]Jesus, this game is loud, loud.
[04:14.42]Is this a controller game, Hoke?
[04:23.79]It looks to just be like, it's Tetris.
[04:26.42]It looks to just be like left, right, down, right, up, down, left, right.
[04:34.05]Okay, well.
[04:37.75]Alright.
[04:38.47]fellas well we're gonna do it anyway fellas tricky towers from 2016 I've never heard of this yeah me neither so loud for me there's multiple modes do you know what the good mode is poke like race survival poke made us buy this and now he's gone
[05:07.98]He doesn't even like us.
[05:09.23]I'm here.
[05:09.55]What's going on?
[05:10.05]I'm back.
[05:10.43]What happened?
[05:11.01]I'm sorry.
[05:11.41]I had to do something.
[05:13.33]Yeah.
[05:14.21]Hoke, is this a controller game?
[05:15.53]That's question one.
[05:18.86]No.
[05:19.80]Not controller game?
[05:21.74]Question two is what is the best game mode for us to play?
[05:26.01]I'm inviting us.
[05:27.75]I'm inviting us.
[05:30.06]Did you make it random, random, random?
[05:32.38]I didn't.
[05:36.18]Okay.
[05:36.58]I'm in the game.
[05:39.46]I gotta turn this game down though, this is fucking loud.
[05:46.50]Alright, who should I pick?
[05:52.69]Who's the best character?
[05:53.77]Yeah, how do I join?
[05:56.35]There should all be different ones, but they don't have any stats or anything.
[06:02.46]I think I need another invite.
[06:05.10]This is a controller game, alright, I'll try.
[06:08.75]it doesn't work with the PS5 controller for some reason so I'll do it so who's hosting you okay who's am I in somebody's game right now no controller please work this game doesn't work on exploit
[06:37.76]wait do you use exploit you don't use exploit come on okay I'm back in joining uh I'm gonna be this funny wizard focus of it to easy it's not easy now we're waiting for uh Vinny and he said this is not a controller game
[07:08.67]My Steam input's not working.
[07:09.84]Do I have to restart the game?
[07:12.92]Probably.
[07:14.32]It works with keyboard, though.
[07:15.55]I'm just doing keyboard.
[07:20.38]I know the keyboard controls.
[07:21.94]Let me try my... Oh, there we go.
[07:25.87]My controller works.
[07:27.83]Okay, I'm good now.

[07:42.66]I don't even know.
[07:43.31]The guy with the star wand.
[07:45.15]No, wait.
[07:45.85]I picked the star wand.
[07:49.01]Jerma picked the moon wand.
[07:52.34]I picked the crystal ball one.
[07:55.48]There's two crystal ball ones.
[07:57.92]He has like a ball on his head.
[07:59.79]Okay.
[08:00.71]Okay.
[08:05.98]Is that kind of like Tetris?
[08:08.22]Yeah.
[08:10.73]My chat says you love Tetris.
[08:14.19]Uh, I am dog shit at Tetris.
[08:15.99]It's one of, it's probably, it's probably a zero out of ten for me when it comes to skill.
[08:22.28]Okay, this is survival mode.
[08:23.74]This is just surviving and don't die.
[08:30.11]Okay, my controller apparently doesn't work.
[08:33.00]I'm the second from the left, chat.
[08:37.98]wait I thought this one was race wait I'm very left I'm oh god third physics I screwed that up so bad oh you take damage if you oh yeah this one's like uh you have hearts there's like a button to nudge though oh I'm spinning up
[09:06.98]and you get upgrades and to use the upgrades wait why did my thing fall off okay it's you and I if you're on a keyboard my tower is tricky yeah I changed my buttons okay oh that's a that's a line oh I see it's uh okay it's Matt it's mad at me
[09:36.33]I thought I could bend the rules a little bit.
[09:38.41]Did I just win?
[09:41.32]Who won?
[09:42.42]I think that's me.
[09:42.92]Is that you, Jermis?
[09:43.92]Yeah, Jermis31.
[09:44.68]Wow.
[09:48.25]The guy who's not good at Tetris won.
[09:50.19]I somehow pulled that through.
[09:51.71]I don't know how.
[09:53.41]I thought that I could build off to the side, like, at one block.
[09:57.82]Okay, I get it.
[09:58.14]But it killed me.
[09:59.18]Okay, this one is, like, uh... Don't go over the line.
[10:03.15]But put as many pieces as you can on.
[10:05.07]Don't go over the line?
[10:05.97]Okay.
[10:13.03]Don't go over the line shit And you have a power up yeah, I don't know what the fuck that did The tingle makes everything sticky.
[10:30.94]Yeah, it sticks everything together What what what does sticky mean?
[10:35.59]It roots them together it makes the things attached together and they can't
[10:41.52]They're just attached physically.
[10:43.46]I'm like going so fast.
[10:46.01]I thought it was like Tetris.
[10:47.21]I'm trying to go fast.
[10:49.31]Yeah, I tried to go fast.
[10:50.19]I mean, I just, yeah, I just didn't get anything.
[10:53.20]It's awesome.
[10:54.62]Oh.
[10:54.70]Uh-oh.
[10:58.35]No.
[11:00.27]Who's two?
[11:02.18]Me.
[11:02.86]You just beat us all.
[11:11.83]knows how many blocks you had I gotta stop trying to make lines guys I got this I know I do he said it was you and I right okay this is survive this is just surviving don't fall
[11:41.47]Well, then, yeah, shouldn't you just not place blocks?
[11:45.48]Oh, but you have a whoever finishes their limit first.
[11:48.27]You see you have the top, your mount.
[11:54.32]That was dumb, what I just did.
[11:56.08]Gotta use all your pieces to win.
[12:02.13]Oops.
[12:02.61]Whoops.
[12:12.15]yeah the music maddening oh I this game has tricky towers in it let's get lightning oh you got to use you don't get double items I think so so so okay I got an item and then I got another one and it overwrote the item dude what's going on with the screen
[12:40.76]Okay, I'm starting to comprehend.
[12:42.96]That's bad.
[12:49.09]That's bad.
[12:52.45]I'm fucking screwed.
[12:53.76]No.
[12:58.58]How do you use an item?
[13:03.65]You and I was like nudging for me.
[13:06.68]It's like K. K, okay.
[13:09.83]Or J or L. One of those.
[13:13.10]Okay, I finally figured it out.
[13:24.56]Okay.
[13:25.44]Puzzle.
[13:29.85]Those are the number of blocks ones, I think.
[13:38.03]Yeah, your power-up kill is the last thing you put down.
[13:40.71]Oh, cool.
[13:50.48]What?
[13:53.21]What?
[13:56.57]I tried to give it physics so I could extend the tower.
[14:02.38]The physics or I'm learning?
[14:05.74]Oh, look at that.
[14:06.72]You used your lightning.
[14:07.94]Oh.
[14:08.56]Uh-oh.
[14:15.71]Like, is this not allowed?
[14:16.87]No!
[14:19.64]No!
[14:22.24]Like... Oh, come on!
[14:30.01]Lightning?
[14:30.39]I pressed K. It didn't do anything.
[14:34.61]How do you even know if you have an ability?
[14:44.72]Okay, this is a race, and there's wind.
[14:47.89]You have to get to the top.
[14:49.21]You can fall as much as you want.
[14:53.35]Oh, so fast.
[14:54.84]Yeah.
[14:56.02]Alright.
[14:56.20]Fast enough.
[15:01.36]Oh, fuck.
[15:05.11]uh you could use a nudge to push things off this game's physic I I know what tetris is but tetris doesn't have physics no I pressed the wrong I hate when steam games have an ad and the ad has like streamers playing the game you know what I'm saying yeah I know what you're saying and we're streamers
[15:35.31]Yeah, I just don't like when I see just random people playing a game.
[15:39.40]No, this shit's toppling over!
[15:40.98]Don't fly too close to the sun, Icarus.
[15:49.61]Ooh.
[15:52.24]What's that?
[15:53.88]Some tricky bullshit.
[15:55.18]Some tricky bullshit just occurred.
[16:02.13]Hey!
[16:04.39]Stop!
[16:06.01]Whoa, balloon?
[16:08.73]What do you mean, balloon?
[16:10.14]Hey!
[16:10.64]Zubris gave me a piano!
[16:11.82]Windmill?
[16:17.39]Hey, whoever just gave me the ice, you just broke my tower.
[16:19.39]Thanks, man.
[16:22.66]What the fuck?
[16:23.38]I can't place anything.
[16:25.43]Fuck ice.
[16:27.21]Yeah, dude.
[16:32.37]No, please.
[16:33.35]Oh my god.
[16:34.71]I'm gonna fucking crash out.
[16:40.72]It's so fucked.
[16:47.01]I need to get rid of all this shit and start over.
[16:48.45]I'm never gonna be able to do anything again.
[16:54.56]Nudge it.
[17:02.93]I want to just push this all off.
[17:05.31]Look at how fucking awful this is.
[17:09.32]Yeah, I'm... Having a good time, sir.
[17:13.06]What is going on?
[17:15.41]It was huge.
[17:15.95]The block was huge.
[17:17.89]Get off!
[17:22.52]What am I doing?
[17:24.08]It might actually work.
[17:33.50]There we go!
[17:34.06]Fucking finally!
[17:35.09]Now I can at least start over!
[17:36.33]No!
[17:43.16]Oh my god, I couldn't even see it.
[17:46.54]No!
[17:47.47]Is it lowering the finish line because we all suck?
[17:50.01]I think it is.
[17:51.31]Okay, I wish I could use the controller.
[17:53.17]I want to use the controller.
[17:56.44]Pressing up instead of not being able to press... I... Yeah.
[18:02.29]The controller is helpful.
[18:04.15]I used Steam input.
[18:06.00]You have to restart the game, but it's good.
[18:09.14]Yeah.
[18:13.36]Puzzle special.
[18:16.27]What's puzzle special?
[18:18.47]It's how many blocks you can put down.
[18:19.97]Use the nudge to make it fit.
[18:26.48]That didn't work.
[18:34.03]This one is kind of special.
[18:46.26]Oh my fucking god.
[18:48.08]Yeah.
[18:50.36]Yeah.
[18:54.93]I clearly was misunderstanding the concept.
[19:04.73]It's actually by work.
[19:11.54]Oh, poke is fucking cheating over there.
[19:13.78]What the fuck?
[19:15.18]Poke figured shit out.
[19:16.94]Please don't do it.
[19:18.24]No.
[19:19.09]What the fuck was wrong with that?
[19:24.07]This isn't Tetris.
[19:25.61]This isn't Tetris at all.
[19:31.66]I got to get this.
[19:35.70]oh you piece of shit oh man okay well I know who wins is that wedged in there enough this actually might be alright wait what's this oh no that was a timer
[20:03.49]oh god no fuck oh that's not good oh I understand how did that stay up on the left look at that thing physics man I kept dropping stuff
[20:30.12]Race normal, alright.
[20:32.86]I'm about to fuckin' unleash.
[20:34.36]Oh no, race.
[20:36.41]You know what, no, I did alright last time we did race.
[20:39.87]You won last time, you fuckin' crybaby.
[20:43.76]Yeah.
[20:50.26]Come on.
[20:51.09]Look at this RNG.
[20:57.01]How come I nudge left and it bounces off and goes right?
[21:05.93]No, what the fuck?
[21:11.24]Oh man.
[21:22.56]Oh my God.
[21:24.25]I seriously, I seriously smashed my fucking Game Boy.
[21:27.96]I hated Tetris, dude.
[21:29.80]Whenever anyone was like, you want to play Tetris?
[21:31.34]Be like, dude, bro, fucking throw that shit out that fucking window.
[21:37.37]No, no.
[21:40.64]Everything I worked for.
[21:42.00]That's like Yoshi music.
[21:50.09]Yeah.
[21:56.55]Thanks for the piano.
[21:58.26]What is this windmill?
[22:09.48]I need weight on this side.
[22:11.65]Oh my god.
[22:23.03]Seriously, this is so fucking annoying!
[22:28.55]Oh my god, dude, this piano.
[22:30.68]This whole thing is fucking fried like an egg.
[22:36.46]Oh man, that sucked so bad, guys.
[22:41.94]It's spun.
[22:42.99]And it's ice.
[22:49.31]I thought my genius idea was you have to use it, actually.
[22:56.63]Take that!
[23:00.97]What am I supposed to do with it?
[23:02.96]What'd it do?
[23:03.26]What'd it do?
[23:03.86]That was so bad to see.
[23:05.40]That was so painful looking.
[23:07.13]I was doing so good!
[23:08.31]God damn it.
[23:13.30]Can I get something else besides an ice windmill fucking block?
[23:16.32]I can't- What is going on?
[23:24.98]Dude, that actually might help me.
[23:26.32]That's what I thought.
[23:31.86]Ohhhh man.
[23:32.75]You know what's good?
[23:37.45]I hated that windmill.
[23:39.57]Take this!
[23:40.89]What is this windmill shit?
[23:51.55]Please don't tip over.
[23:52.33]I have to place the windmill?
[23:55.03]No, I'm trying to... No!
[24:04.62]Just focus.
[24:08.49]Guys, I kind of screwed up my whole thing here.
[24:10.35]I kind of screwed up everything.
[24:16.40]Trying to get a foundation when you have no foundation is awful.
[24:29.10]Who even got up there?
[24:31.34]Yeah!
[24:32.43]Oh my god.
[24:33.05]That was funny.
[24:36.83]That was the most troll run ever.
[24:41.56]Wait, wait, wait!
[24:42.80]Yours fell off!
[24:44.36]You got first?
[24:45.14]No, I just spammed.
[24:47.36]I threw away the blocks I didn't want and I just got the nice ones.
[24:49.91]Alright, I'm trying as hard as I can this time.
[24:54.71]Alright, don't embarrass yourself.
[24:56.49]Dude, the fundamentals of Tetris, dude, I haven't thought about that since I was six before I smashed my Game Boy into the fucking wall.
[25:02.48]It's kind of not the same, though.
[25:04.52]Tetris 99 was really good.
[25:06.80]That I genuinely enjoyed.
[25:08.10]Already down two hearts.
[25:17.68]Very cool.
[25:20.60]What the hell is that?
[25:22.90]Oh, no, no.
[25:23.65]Okay, just one.
[25:29.55]wave two oh god wait piano what piano what was our objective oh my god I freaked out I'm dying I'm trying to build up to the line I'm gonna press the button stop dude
[26:00.58]Yeah.
[26:02.69]I goofed.
[26:03.83]I played the wrong objective.
[26:13.31]Give me some more first places.
[26:26.77]This game is weirdly addicting though.
[26:28.83]As much as I hate every second of it, I love every second of it.
[26:39.88]That foundation doesn't look good over there.
[26:47.53]I don't like it.
[26:54.60]What do you like?
[26:56.72]A lot of things.
[27:05.27]No, what?
[27:09.42]No, I'll do that again.
[27:10.32]I don't care.
[27:10.82]What the hell did I do wrong?
[27:12.30]Nope.
[27:13.63]Oh.
[27:15.35]This is bad.
[27:17.65]Bad.
[27:19.13]But it's alright.
[27:22.50]Oh, fuck.
[27:30.98]Oh, she's the... Why, why, why, why, why?
[27:33.30]I should not have gone for that.
[27:38.91]Shit.
[27:39.05]Stop it!
[27:39.57]Don't do that.
[27:41.29]The greed, dude.
[27:45.62]Just taking it slow.
[27:48.40]Come on!
[27:49.52]No!
[27:50.31]No!
[27:55.39]Oh, the whole thing is messed up now.
[27:58.60]I saw how close you were and I freaked out.
[28:03.16]What?!
[28:04.52]Oh my god, everything is rough.
[28:06.45]That's how I be losing poke.
[28:09.29]The snowy blocks are so fucking bullshit!
[28:12.58]No!
[28:13.96]You get one snowy block and everything just goes to shit.
[28:18.66]Okay, maybe it was too slow.
[28:28.32]Use your spell?
[28:29.24]I was spamming K, it didn't do anything.

[34:20.60]Uh-oh.
[34:22.01]Don't fall.
[34:23.63]I should have lightninged it.
[34:24.51]What am I doing then?
[34:27.72]That's going to fall.
[34:28.58]The sassy kazoo music, I swear to God.

[34:56.97]Oh my god.
[34:57.53]No.
[35:01.69]What a fucking disaster.
[35:05.54]What a fucked up day.
[35:09.69]When it zooms out, dude, it becomes harder to see where you're placing it.
[35:18.29]My worst game mode.
[35:24.67]No.
[35:26.63]I'm dead.
[35:28.33]Yay.

[35:40.37]J?
[35:41.25]What do you mean J?
[35:41.99]I thought it was K and L. One of them.
[35:46.62]He's gatekeeping.
[35:47.34]He checked the settings.
[35:50.32]He's gatekeeping.
[35:50.94]I changed mine.
[35:54.85]Yeah, but you have good memory.
[35:56.01]You know what it is.
[35:56.91]You're just hiding it.

[36:00.42]True, actually.
[36:01.98]Gatekeeper.
[36:05.53]No, no, no, no, no, no.

[36:09.26]This game is so fun, Polk.
[36:16.89]It's a banger.
[36:19.19]It just ruined everything.
[36:20.07]Why would that fall over?
[36:21.23]Oh, because of the fucking wind?
[36:22.94]It's over for me.
[36:27.56]I don't even know what I just did.
[36:30.78]I don't know what will take this.
[36:33.14]Well, thanks for the giant ice.
[36:35.47]That's gonna help me.
[36:39.15]I gotta nudge this.
[36:40.03]I'm actually... bricked.

[37:23.19]Unleashed.
[37:24.25]What did you just do to my piece?
[37:25.59]I didn't click that.
[37:29.70]It's over.

[39:48.29]What am I doing?
[39:54.54]No spinning allowed, huh?
[39:58.03]That's bad.
[40:01.39]That's how we deal with that.
[40:03.18]Yeah, it just looks like my worst day.
[40:05.86]It looks real.
[40:08.03]I hate it so much.
[40:11.59]What's going on?
[40:16.62]Nudge!

[41:38.52]I don't know.
[41:40.17]I don't want to poison the Amazon.
[41:43.19]You should put a fake character on it.
[41:48.06]That was the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life.
[41:52.27]And now everything is fucked.
[41:56.85]Wait, I'm okay.
[41:59.16]Oh my god, I hate using keyboard.
[42:03.25]We should have restarted so you could use a controller, man.
[42:05.49]I know.
[42:05.73]I gotta live with it.
[42:06.79]I have to deal with it.
[42:08.35]Yeah.

[42:28.28]Fucking disaster.
[42:36.61]This guy is fucking gaming.
[42:40.80]There's no way this is going to work out.
[42:51.53]There's no way.
[42:54.82]What the?
[42:59.04]Who did that?
[43:01.18]No one I know of.
[43:09.13]Shit's going too fast.
[43:11.81]I just ran out of anything useful.
[43:17.38]Look at that beaut of a tower.
[43:26.17]Okay.
[43:29.57]Oh, this one's fun.
[43:30.09]I like this one.

[43:33.39]Oh, God.
[43:34.05]Alright.
[43:34.27]You got to use the nudge.
[43:50.46]What?
[43:50.96]I didn't want to do that.
[43:53.56]Well, you did it.
[44:00.99]That was probably a bad idea.
[44:10.26]I don't understand how the nudge works.
[44:14.35]Is my primary issue.
[44:19.25]Hmm.
[44:20.11]It should be fine, right?
[44:21.17]Yep.
[44:22.15]Oh, come on.

[51:44.75]I was thinking about it, but I didn't want to go there.
[51:46.93]Of the lowest hanging of the globe.
[51:48.67]Oh my god, lowest.

[52:38.09]Yes.
[52:38.85]The speed is so bad, it's fucking horrible.
[52:44.57]Yeah.
[52:45.79]I agree.
[52:46.68]You don't even count as, like, winning that one.
[52:52.34]Steadily second-placing your way to victory.
[53:00.65]I- oops.
[53:01.22]Sit back and watch a master at work.
[53:08.38]What does that even do?
[53:09.74]It would be nice to know what all the power-ups even do.
[53:15.19]I fucked up.
[53:16.15]I didn't really, like... Well, that's bad.
[53:20.66]The power-up was revealed to me too late.
[53:26.35]Oh!
[53:27.40]Okay, guys.
[53:29.36]Ugh.
[53:46.48]I'm gonna go and make it not any worse.

[54:29.10]I had to learn how to get good at that one.
[54:33.06]This is survive, right?
[54:35.07]Yes.
[54:37.87]You know what you have to do in that one, right?
[54:40.25]Go as fast as you can and just fall off.
[54:42.31]Don't die.
[54:44.70]Sounds like my YouTube career.
[54:46.78]No respect.
[54:47.52]No respect.
[54:53.97]I'm so good.
[55:02.72]Gotta get this foundation.
[55:06.04]No, what the fuck?
[55:07.00]I didn't want to press that.
[55:09.30]Whoa, calm down with the fucking Fs tonight, man.
[55:13.67]every good petris tower has a strong foundation not mine uh-oh can you please nudge correctly just this once just for me
[55:45.97]Why did I do that?
[55:54.06]I need a long one.
[56:00.65]Come on, dude.
[56:01.83]It sounds like a... Jackbox music.
[56:06.74]Fuck.
[56:11.44]Wait, what?
[56:12.22]You already got up there?
[56:14.20]It's about how many points you use.
[56:18.05]You want to use all your blocks.
[56:19.35]I thought that was survive.
[56:21.52]Yeah, it's survive, but use all your blocks.
[56:23.56]They have a limit of blocks.
[56:24.88]Oh, I didn't know that.
[56:26.25]It's survive, but use everything.
[56:30.15]Oh, fuck.
[56:31.08]Okay, so you have to go fast.
[56:36.47]When you talk, I'm out.

[58:23.50]I don't know what block I'm waiting for.
[58:28.46]Really screwed that one up, huh, Chad?
[58:30.71]It's fucked up.
[58:31.03]I can't move this thing.
[58:34.31]I'm going to knock the whole tower over.
[58:35.53]A very easy thing to do.
[58:40.83]my thing is just like so slightly offset that another block will never be placed ever again the wind is horrendous I would love to get something the stick here even whatever just start over fine who cares what the oh
[59:11.11]No, no, the French.
[59:14.37]The fucking, the French.
[59:16.23]Oh my god, I did the thing where you jump in Mario and you jump again, but even when you land at the spot you wanted to get to.
[59:24.16]I know the feeling, yes.
[59:28.73]The wind is fucking dumb.
[59:33.92]You know that game Mario?
[59:36.62]Never heard of it.

[59:54.64]That ruined my whole thing.
[60:02.68]I gotta get first place right now.
[60:07.26]Jerm, if you lose this one, you're gonna be up all night thinking about it.
[60:11.75]You have to focus.
[60:13.82]This is survive, right?
[60:15.56]Yeah, look at the number up top.
[60:16.98]So much you gotta put down too.
[60:22.15]You got this.
[60:26.11]Don't die.
[60:28.68]Hey.
[60:34.74]God damn it.
[60:35.28]That's so fucked up.
[60:37.19]Yeah, that's bad.
[60:42.55]Like, ruin my everything.
[60:44.19]I'm dead over that.
[60:45.63]The fuck is this thing?
[60:55.64]Perfect.
[60:57.08]A piano?
[61:01.23]These towers are getting a little tricky.
[61:03.79]I'm very upset.
[61:07.69]Bob, are you not playing no damn piano?
[61:12.17]I don't know about those things, son.
[61:26.86]Did I just lose to you guys because you had fucking floating platforms?
[61:30.01]I don't even get third.
[61:31.47]I don't even know what happened to me.
[61:33.61]Oh, I had a floating platform.
[61:34.99]I could have been fine.
[61:36.90]Could have been fine.
[61:43.74]Bobby must make sushi.
[61:46.92]Oh, I. He does make sushi in my keyboard.
[61:50.59]That's why I said Bobby.
[61:55.16]Gotta make sushi, Bobby.
[61:59.64]You want to play some boggle?
[62:04.37]You're pretty good, Bobby.
[62:05.45]Unlike those boys, Buford and Bernardo, who keep whacking in my trailer.
[62:20.58]No, come on, dude!
[62:21.66]You can't do that to me!
[62:22.68]I hate how you can't spin it!
[62:27.11]You can't get rid of it ever.
[62:35.18]Fuck this!
[62:40.39]Poke is fucking goaded with the blocks.
[62:46.50]I'm going with the poke strat.
[62:48.30]Fuck this.
[62:51.91]I wish to be goaded with the blocks.
[62:53.78]Everything is so messed up on mine.
[63:08.20]What was I thinking?
[63:09.04]No.
[63:12.18]Why'd I put that there?
[63:22.32]The West has fallen.
[63:27.81]No, I nudged it!
[63:55.65]Stay up there.
[63:57.05]You piece of shit.

[64:00.30]No!
[64:01.52]That might help me, actually.
[64:02.78]No!
[64:13.74]Oh, I was looking at Stuart the whole time.

[64:48.54]I was reading the meta at the Google Reddit.
[64:53.34]This guy just needs a second place.
[64:55.39]This is bullshit.
[64:56.31]Poke, unscrew your Reddit.
[65:02.31]I'll get this one.
[65:03.83]I'm gonna go for a record here.
[65:07.90]Okay, I didn't hold the button that long.
[65:10.28]What the fuck?
[65:11.32]My computer lagged.
[65:13.06]I had internet lag.
[65:20.47]Dude, all these have been such bad pieces to have.
[65:31.22]Uh-oh.
[65:38.87]What a shit start.
[65:42.16]Just get rid of me.

[66:09.50]What in the hell?
[66:12.81]Get that dang old porky's butthole.
[66:15.09]On the brain.
[66:21.88]What the fuck?
[66:22.18]Vinny hears one of Ster's noises and he has to respond with one of his own.
[66:25.35]It's like elk mating.
[66:26.57]Okay.
[66:27.01]Watch this!
[66:30.09]Well, I saw the vision.
[66:34.68]I saw the vision, but you didn't Google Reddit hard enough.
[66:40.08]And with that, Polk wins.
[66:42.59]Alright, we're doing one more.
[66:44.11]One more and that's it.
[66:48.40]Okay.
[66:50.16]Okay.
[66:51.06]One more and that's it?
[66:52.96]We're doing the real one more.
[66:56.61]And then I'm gonna go twist my tower.
[67:05.87]Spacebar, press space.
[67:06.87]Guys, spacebar.
[67:10.11]We just saved three seconds.
[67:11.45]Huge.

[68:10.36]Oh shit, what would poke do here?
[68:14.15]Alright, why am I still going?
[68:32.45]Because you can place as many as you want, dumb shit.
[68:34.73]You don't know the rules yet?
[68:35.47]Yeah, that's what I would have did.
[68:37.63]They shot back in last year.
[68:40.18]Back in Paris.
[68:41.66]I know a sniper.
[68:43.16]I got friends with snipers.
[68:44.93]I'm sorry.
[68:46.63]What?
[68:47.01]You're highly aggressive there.
[68:48.01]You could have just had nine.
[68:50.03]You could have just placed the top one.
[68:57.11]I thought it was just like a sniper.
[68:59.19]I'm not a sniper, but I know I got friends with snipers.
[69:02.15]What are you- what?
[69:03.34]What is this bit?
[69:04.08]I like this bit.
[69:05.08]You never saw the X-Hitman re-access speed rap?
[69:08.46]You never see- No.
[69:09.82]You never- I think it's one of your favorite things.
[69:14.25]Oh man, XHitman reacts to a Hitman speedrun.
[69:17.52]It's the funniest video.
[69:19.02]One of the funniest ones on YouTube.
[69:21.28]Okay.
[69:22.26]Wait, oh, okay.
[69:24.02]The game Hitman.
[69:24.84]Okay, yes.
[69:25.37]Yeah, it's like some like real guy who apparently killed people like was a Hitman.
[69:29.87]And he's just like, they're just showing him gameplay footage.
[69:32.11]He's like, yeah, that's what I would have did.
[69:34.18]Yeah, I got people back in a... And then, yeah, there's like memes of it.
[69:39.10]It's good.
[69:43.01]I like memes.

[69:44.68]Dude, memes are my favorite.
[69:50.05]Oh, bad.
[69:50.79]Uh-oh.
[69:52.43]That sucks.
[69:53.10]That sucks so hard.
[69:53.70]I should not explain memes.
[69:55.18]Oh.
[69:56.60]Oh.
[69:57.34]I don't know where this is going to go.
[69:58.38]I want to know.
[69:59.11]I want to know the memes.
[70:00.19]No, no, no.
[70:04.12]Why is it falling?
[70:05.86]Nothing's happening!
[70:07.08]Oh my god.
[70:08.08]Look, anytime you think there's something I may enjoy, be sure to let me know.
[70:13.85]Like the fart DJ?
[70:15.59]Yeah, dude.
[70:18.72]Cool.
[70:21.84]That's what I would've did.
[70:23.90]That's what I would've done.
[70:26.67]Oh my god.
[70:29.45]Oops.
[70:36.96]I don't know what happened there.
[70:38.86]Just kind of... He needed that so he could go to bed, guys.
[70:43.14]Thanks for giving that to him.
[70:50.33]He finally won.
[70:51.98]I always... I'm gonna fucking flip out of my chat in a second.
[71:00.65]Here comes a streamer freakout at their chat.
[71:17.34]How do these blocks already feel misaligned?
[71:25.13]Whoa.
[71:52.25]I am going to fucking scream.
[72:03.73]I'm about to... I'm about to Tetris.
[72:12.68]Whatever.
[72:13.06]Guys, I had the worst moment of my life just a second ago.
[72:18.70]It was pretty bad.
[72:29.93]This is great.
[72:33.46]Hey, I'm ranking up badges.
[72:34.76]Is there only one the ones where you do that, by the way?
[72:46.08]No rebuttal.
[72:47.40]I love that video, too.
[72:51.48]I'm wondering something.
[72:52.37]Hang on a minute.
[72:53.15]Is he watching that exact footage?
[72:55.29]Yes.
[72:57.10]There's a guy clipping through the sky.
[72:58.85]Yes, that's what he watches.
[73:01.53]It's just funny.
[73:02.49]I gotta go for it.
[73:03.05]Funny guy.
[73:03.63]I gotta go for it.
[73:04.30]I gotta go for it.
[73:05.04]I gotta go for it.
[73:05.76]The first half of that video is more normal.
[73:09.04]And then I think it goes to Hitman.
[73:25.33]Yeah, it's like, man, the music.
[73:31.54]Like baby, addictive baby music.
[73:36.23]Were you an addicted baby?
[73:38.51]Yeah.

[75:57.20]Oh, fuck you, Poke.
[76:00.74]And yeah, you're muted.
[76:03.50]Why was I muted?
[76:04.20]And since how long?
[76:05.76]Constantly.
[76:06.66]What the fuck?
[76:07.92]I don't know, a while.
[76:10.01]Was it laughing at- Oh my f- I don't think you were.
[76:14.53]No!
[76:16.07]No!
[76:16.15]Oh my god, this is bad.
[76:17.82]I might have been muted the whole time.
[76:22.26]This fucking wind.
[76:31.38]I should get this power up here.
[76:46.48]There's no foundation.
[76:52.17]I didn't even want to do that, dude.
[76:53.61]I didn't even... I didn't want to do that.
[76:57.68]S!

[77:10.97]My camera's stuck here.
[77:12.47]My god, dude.
[77:15.43]Stop spinning it on me!
[77:16.71]Who's doing that power up?
[77:17.94]It's unfair.
[77:22.92]This game's hard enough without your fucking trickery.
[77:26.89]It's true.
[77:30.88]when they can spin them on you without you spinning it that's diabolical nice one vin yeah Ster what's your vin number I'm winning there's another one for the compilation huh Ster that's what I would have did that's right
[78:02.98]You're going down, buddy.
[78:04.46]You're going down.
[78:10.29]Oh, come on.
[78:10.87]Oh, boy.

[78:54.16]No, you don't want to do that.
[78:56.00]No, you twat.
[78:57.56]No.

[79:00.91]I'm being crowned for like no reason.
[79:08.57]I gotta get a big round here.
[79:22.60]You should focus on your game.
[79:29.73]I had got- how many first places do I have this- I got three!
[79:37.02]Sounds like you're focused on the past, not the future.
[79:39.59]I'm winning, I'm sick.
[79:43.33]That is it.
[79:44.35]Poke, you're muted.
[79:46.32]Oh, okay, good.
[79:46.90]I'm kidding.
[79:48.80]I'm kidding.
[79:49.06]Yeah, but could you?
[79:52.59]Okay.
[79:54.11]You gotta give me something else besides these fucking zigzag blocks, man.
[79:57.09]That's all I get.
[79:58.94]They have names, you know.
[80:01.06]I don't know them, but they have names.
[80:02.52]Is his name fucking Larry?
[80:03.82]I don't give a shit.
[80:05.27]Let me read the zigzag.
[80:07.78]I knew it.
[80:09.20]They did it like I would've done that.
[80:12.26]That's exactly what he says.
[80:14.64]Did it like I would've done it.
[80:20.89]You gotta watch the whole video.
[80:22.89]The real one.
[80:24.50]Yeah, I like that already.
[80:25.80]I like that.
[80:30.68]The concept of a guy that actually killed someone apparently.
[80:35.43]I don't know, but watching a fuck-ass speedrun of a guy in the sky glitching, like, yeah, I would have done that.
[80:44.56]That's a good one.
[80:46.20]That's crazy.
[80:51.18]Oh, that's the worst thing that could have happened.
[80:58.27]Let's get that shit out of here.
[80:59.29]We're getting out of this one.
[81:00.83]That piece is fucking horrendous.
[81:04.40]Yeah.
[81:06.08]It's over for me.
[81:07.65]Good, I fucking killed you.
