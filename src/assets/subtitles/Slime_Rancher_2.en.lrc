[00:03.03]What's going on?
[00:06.33]Wait.
[00:07.93]What?
[00:08.07]Wait.
[00:08.97]Hold on.
[00:09.38]I don't know what I did with my drink.
[00:12.06]And my tea is the most important thing on stream.
[00:18.08]My green tea or energy drink that I have here is my Spider-Man Iron Man suit.
[00:29.04]I'm sorry.
[00:30.08]I need it.
[00:34.04]Be right back.
[01:12.76]Peter, if you're nothing without the suit, then you're nothing at all.
[01:20.54]Peter, if you're nothing without the green tea, then are you really Spider-Man?
[01:25.75]Yeah, I still am.
[01:26.73]It's a drink.
[01:27.83]I'm fine.
[01:28.87]Shut up.
[01:32.77]It's literally green tea.
[01:34.45]I'll be... I am Spider-Man.
[01:44.71]Who am I even arguing with?
[01:48.35]Yeah, people... Oh, Popeye, when Popeye breaks open the spinach can, he eats the spinach.
[01:52.92]Iron Man didn't walk onto the set and go, hey, Popeye, if you're nothing without the spinach, you're nothing at all.
[01:57.90]No, Popeye said it's a nutritious fucking thing and I can... I'm gonna knock your lights out, actually.
[02:12.57]Who are you... What is he talking about?
[02:15.82]Do you guys not know what I'm referring to?
[02:21.50]I thought you guys watched Marvel movies.
[02:25.00]What?
[02:25.30]You don't know?
[02:26.26]I think they're doing this on purpose.
[02:38.87]Yeah, see, I understand.
[02:40.03]Somebody does.
[02:40.50]That's from Homecoming.
[02:42.98]Yeah.
[02:44.28]Wait, is it?
[02:47.06]What movie is that from?
[02:50.62]That's from Homecoming, right?
[02:55.01]Yeah, it is.
[02:56.73]Okay.
[02:57.65]Anyways, hi guys.
[02:58.19]How you doing?
[02:58.49]We're going to be playing some Slime Rancher 2 today.
[03:01.47]It came out.
[03:02.67]It's in technically early access.
[03:12.80]I liked the last one.
[03:13.74]I thought the last one was great.
[03:15.58]So why not try the other one?
[03:19.57]How was my birthday?
[03:20.19]My birthday was great.
[03:20.81]I had a really good time.
[03:22.19]Yeah, once you get over 30.
[03:28.49]Your birthday just is a birthday kind of.
[03:30.79]It's not like oh my God, we're going to wear birthday hats and there's going to be like a bunch of cake stuff.
[03:37.04]Well, I actually Holly did make me a cake, so excuse me.
[03:45.00]That happens at 40.
[03:52.81]That was a nice day.
[03:55.69]The big everybody needs to show up is 40.
[04:02.68]If you're invited and you don't show up to my 40th birthday, I may have to cross you off the friends list.
[04:09.70]Because I mean, really?
[04:10.52]40.
[04:12.86]I don't care if you miss 31 through 39.
[04:19.02]That's 40.
[04:25.01]And I'm gonna be doing it in the McDonald's fucking pla- place.
[04:27.38]You know, okay, somebody just said in pre-stream, he's gonna be really sus today, I can tell.
[04:37.47]And like, fuck.
[04:38.79]I- I have been.
[04:40.07]I've been like, saying weird shit for the first, like, ten minutes.
[04:43.89]Why did you know that?
[04:44.87]Why did you know that I was gonna be really sus today?
[04:56.66]I don't know.
[04:56.98]Somebody must have had some vision or something.
[05:02.61]But yeah, 40 is when I'll care.
[05:06.45]Every birthday from 31.
[05:07.73]Okay, you freak out when you hit 30.
[05:11.55]And then it just doesn't matter.
[05:15.04]At 31 and 32, you're kind of just, I don't really care.
[05:22.02]40 is the next big one where it's, you know, this is zero at the end.
[05:24.39]It's like, oh shit.
[05:25.45]Okay, this is another one.
[05:27.07]Another zero.
[05:33.51]But I appreciate all the birthday wishes I saw.
[05:37.45]There was a lot of cool artwork and people saying happy birthday.
[05:43.32]Thank you.
[05:43.92]I'm surprised that that many people on the internet would say that to some random guy who has gone on record talking about putting baseballs up his ass.
[05:56.61]So, I mean, thanks.
[05:57.65]I appreciate it.
[05:59.69]Hope we can have a good time still today.
[06:11.27]Here's to 39 more baseballs, but that's implying that I'm 39.
[06:15.98]I'm 37.
[06:16.36]You got it wrong.
[06:23.63]Actually, I would much rather people think that I was older.
[06:28.96]I kind of pre-bake my birthday.
[06:32.00]Does anybody else do this?
[06:33.85]Maybe you do this when you're after 30.
[06:36.13]But I have been telling, oh, how old are you?
[06:39.25]Oh, I'm 37.
[06:40.39]Even though I wasn't.
[06:41.95]Just because I need to prepare for being older.
[06:45.63]So now, maybe like six to seven months from now, I'm just going to be like, yeah, I'm almost 38 pretty much.
[06:50.67]I'm turning 30.
[06:51.03]I'm 38 soon.
[06:52.71]38.
[06:54.24]So then when I'm actually 38, it's like, oh, I've been saying, it doesn't matter.
[06:57.06]I'm prepared for it.
[06:59.34]I do that too, kind of, yeah.
[07:03.36]Alright, let's go.
[07:04.22]Slime Rancher 2.
[07:06.34]Welcome, everybody.
[07:12.56]I do that too?
[07:13.06]Yeah, it makes it easier.
[07:14.64]Makes it, uh... It's more palatable for your brain.
[07:18.01]Just say you're 40 now and prepare for it.
[07:27.99]I don't know if I want to do that.
[07:32.71]Alright, is this game good?
[07:40.26]How is it?
[07:40.60]Is this game good?
[07:45.52]Yeah?
[07:48.06]I've seen a few slimes and they're cute.
[07:49.68]Okay.
[07:55.17]It's the same as 1, but better?
[07:58.61]Okay.
[07:59.27]Let's go.
[08:06.58]Tar?
[08:10.96]Oh, well, you can disable the bad slimes.
[08:19.98]Huh.
[08:20.94]Okay, well, one time... How high can you go?
[08:23.79]One and a half times damage?
[08:32.33]We're just playing the regular way.
[08:33.83]I'm not doing anything weird.
[08:40.96]Is there a cutscene?
[08:46.03]After a long day of slime ranching, Beatrix LeBou was enjoying a cool glass of carrot juice as she watched the sunset across the slime sea.
[08:55.46]Suddenly, a boat arrived at her dock with nothing inside but a mysterious letter.
[09:05.22]You've explored the far, far range, from the dusty shores of the Dry Reef to the furthest reaches of the perilous Glass Desert.
[09:12.41]There are worlds yet uncharted, Beatrix LeBou.
[09:16.02]Rainbow Island awaits you.
[09:17.62]Climb aboard if you're ready for a new adventure.
[09:24.80]Beatrix excitedly boarded the boat and took it across the slime sea.
[09:29.76]Eventually, she saw an island unlike anything on the far, far range.
[09:32.76]Mountains, trees, and grasses, all in an array of colors that danced and moved like a dream.
[09:41.95]As she explored, she found an abandoned conservatory overlooking the rest of the island.
[09:45.51]Curiously, it was equipped with everything a slime rancher like her would ever need to wrangle slime, start a farm, and build gadgets.
[09:57.09]That scared the shit out of me.
[10:01.83]And so, a new adventure begins.
[10:05.02]Beatrix tightened her boots, readied her vac pack, and set out to explore Rainbow Island and uncover its mysteries.
[10:14.32]I don't know, it was a loud screaming noise.
[10:16.34]It scared me a little.
[10:21.85]Alright.
[10:22.83]What's up?
[10:24.67]Sensitivity's way too high.
[10:32.57]Let's try that.
[10:36.43]It feels a little bit better.
[10:37.55]Alright, moving around.
[10:40.51]This game looks like the graphics have increased a little.
[10:50.40]There's a lot of bloom.
[10:53.50]It looks pretty good.
[10:54.10]Alright, vac pack.
[10:56.18]Yep.
[10:56.94]Suck in slimes.
[10:58.84]I remember this.
[11:04.23]Yeah, then you gotta shoot them through the barrier, right?
[11:08.27]So, is that... No, that's not it.
[11:09.93]That's not it.
[11:10.49]That's not... That's wrong.
[11:14.84]Shoot through a core... Yeah, here we go.
[11:18.40]Then they sit here.
[11:19.24]They shit out money.
[11:20.28]Okay.
[11:27.90]So they eat fruit, veggies, and meat.
[11:30.06]Right?
[11:30.96]Cool.
[11:31.31]Okay, so then...
[11:34.40]Oh, here's the marketplace, right?
[11:35.38]It's E. Basic player controls?
[11:43.77]Okay, I think I got it.
[11:46.47]So this game just kind of assumed that you finished the first one, and we're downloading the second one.
[11:51.80]And it's like, let's go.
[11:53.60]Let's go, right?
[11:56.58]Like, that's it.
[11:57.54]Let's go.
[12:01.80]So, I need to feed them.
[12:04.40]Where do I get the food?
[12:09.40]Don't you plant berries and shit too?
[12:15.38]Is there a map?
[12:16.20]There is, okay.
[12:16.80]So where am I?
[12:19.70]I think we're going to get Elden Ringed.
[12:23.86]I think it looks like it, right?
[12:24.96]It kind of looks like it, doesn't it?
[12:30.12]Put the cam in a different place, okay.
[12:38.04]Oh yeah, chickens, right?
[12:39.94]Foods like fruits, veggies, or chickens.
[12:41.64]Hold on.
[12:44.28]I've got to... I might be a weirdo, but...
[12:51.45]Does anybody else agree with me that music in the background of a game... Just, I hate it.
[12:57.15]I just, I want it to be quiet.
[12:58.65]I'm a weirdo.
[12:59.79]I've done this, um... I've tested this theory.
[13:03.72]Where if I turn the music off during, like, Dark Souls or Elden Ring... I will play five times better.
[13:12.02]At a boss.
[13:13.94]So, you know how the boss music's always like...
[13:21.03]If I turn that off, I will beat that boss fucking a hundred times easier.
[13:25.01]Okay, so I could have food.
[13:30.37]Alright, try shooting food at a pink slime.
[13:34.01]They'll eat anything.
[13:34.81]They'll eat chickens.
[13:38.37]I thought they didn't.
[13:39.09]I thought they only ate berries.
[13:45.72]Oh, how do I only pick up the money?
[13:49.90]When slimes eat, they make plorts.
[13:51.38]Head on over to the plort market to cash your plort.
[13:53.02]Okay.
[13:57.04]Depends on the game.
[14:00.03]Yeah, I really do.
[14:01.19]You know what?
[14:02.41]It's definitely like a concentration problem or like an ADHD problem.
[14:08.17]But if I turn all the sounds off and I just do it visually, I will first try every boss in Dark Souls.
[14:19.71]Okay, here we go.
[14:21.63]How much money do I got?
[14:22.41]261?
[14:22.51]Get out there and explore.
[14:28.89]So we're just going.
[14:29.56]Alright, so now... How much is it to do another pen?
[14:35.22]Happy slime makes for a happy... Okay, this is 250.
[14:38.36]I have to produce food.
[14:48.37]I gotta do a garden, right?
[14:52.86]Prove it.
[14:53.38]Prove it.
[14:53.88]I don't have Dark Souls ready to go.
[14:58.48]I'm doing a garden.
[15:03.32]Yeah, shoot a veggie or fruit into the depositor to begin growing more of that type.
[15:08.87]Yeah, this is what I want.
[15:09.77]Because I got to start... That was one thing.
[15:12.33]Food was always a huge problem.
[15:15.69]Where's my Wi-Fi off?
[15:19.27]Alright, let's go.
[15:19.83]I'm just going to go straight to the front door.
[15:24.28]Install it right now.
[15:25.45]No, I'm not going to install Dark Souls to turn all the music off and beat Champion Gundyr in one minute.
[15:33.79]I'm not going to do that.
[15:37.77]Silent... Hold on.
[15:55.14]Just prepare it in a different window?
[16:00.54]It sounds like you wanna do it.
[16:02.99]Carrots!
[16:08.91]How many can fit in one, uh, pen?
[16:13.15]Pomegranates?
[16:16.67]Just do it, just do it.
[16:17.61]I don't have a save file that's at any boss.
[16:19.56]They would have to be the first boss of any of those games.
[16:25.25]Well, that's a bunny.
[16:35.54]Yep, fog fruit.
[16:43.79]Oh shit, large slimes are large form when slimy support unlike I forgot, right?
[16:47.69]Alright, I'm going back.
[16:52.35]I'm going back.
[16:56.19]I'm going back.
[16:56.67]Okay, there's the garden.
[17:14.80]I'll do a big pen over here.
[17:15.88]Stay right there.
[17:21.03]Alright.
[17:23.58]Oh, it was like incinerator, pond.
[17:25.61]Okay, right.
[17:26.03]So I want to do this.
[17:26.71]I only have 11 bucks.
[17:28.75]Never mind.
[17:31.23]Will you just hang up over here?
[17:32.33]I feed you.
[17:33.31]Alright.
[17:34.91]Should I do pog fruit or I'm going to do carrots.
[17:36.87]Alright.
[17:41.45]Yeah.
[17:41.75]Carrots.
[17:42.59]And then we'll feed you.
[17:44.21]Here you go, guys.
[17:44.83]Going in.
[17:48.65]They eat anything, right?
[17:53.02]Make some fucking money!
[18:02.59]He's gonna eat somebody.
[18:11.36]How do I suck up just the money?
[18:14.42]Oh, I need to build that, don't I?
[18:17.40]I think I have to actually build it.
[18:22.60]Okay, this is growing, right?
[18:29.86]Yep.
[18:34.26]Floor vacuum for the pen.
[18:35.44]Yeah.
[18:35.66]So what are these worth?
[18:39.16]1.11?
[18:39.18]That's not bad.
[18:46.15]Cool, alright.
[18:47.71]Oh, the market changes too, doesn't it?
[18:49.40]On a daily basis.
[18:56.04]I need to make a... cabinet, whatever.
[19:01.21]A chickadoo?
[19:02.05]Shit, I don't have any money.
[19:07.85]Um...
[19:23.92]Chickadee- Chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee!
[19:27.04]Chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee!
[19:45.27]What do you like that?
[19:46.93]That's what a chickadee does.
[19:48.67]And apparently, apparently that's only cute to your girlfriend!
[19:53.25]Apparently.
[19:54.65]Apparently doing that on the couch, going like, it's only cute to your girlfriend.
[20:00.51]Okay.
[20:11.38]Oh, he's going to be sus today.
[20:24.40]Wait, it's nighttime.
[20:24.96]You have to sleep, don't you?
[20:29.23]You're nearly 40.
[20:29.85]So what, I'm 40, so therefore I cannot ever for the rest of my life imitate a chickadee for the rest of my entire life?
[20:45.91]No, I refuse.
[20:48.22]Hey dude, uh, what's that bird?
[20:49.46]That birds have like a pretty intre- You know, you know that call, that bird call.
[20:53.81]No, I don't, I don't.
[20:54.69]I'm 40.
[20:54.85]No, but you know, it's like, it's like, dee dee dee dee.
[20:57.71]How do you do it?
[20:58.21]I've heard you do it before.
[21:00.39]No.
[21:02.35]No, I'm 40.
[21:03.05]I can't make that sound.
[21:04.91]Yes, it's a fucking bird sound.
[21:06.32]You're fine.
[21:06.76]No, I can't.
[21:09.04]I'm 40.
[21:09.56]I can't make sounds.
[21:11.44]I'm gonna be, I don't care.
[21:12.24]I'm gonna make sounds.
[21:14.74]Until I'm dead.
[21:17.28]You understand that when I'm in my deathbed and there... Why is this rotten?
[21:21.93]Oh, no, it's just nighttime.
[21:23.37]When I'm lying in my deathbed and I'm connected to like, you know what?
[21:26.39]I'm like 90 or something, like 100.
[21:27.79]And everyone's like gathered around the bed and everyone's like, oh, let's just say goodbye to grandpa, right?
[21:33.97]You bet your ass that I'm going to be like... You bet your fucking ass that's the last thing I'm leaving you with.
[21:51.87]Alright, I need to... I need more money.
[21:54.03]Yeah, and what they don't know... It was me making that noise.
[22:09.50]I'm alright.
[22:10.74]I got at least another few days.
[22:12.85]Come back tomorrow!
[22:21.37]Can't make sound effects anymore.
[22:23.03]What is it?
[22:24.65]Alright, so I need more money.
[22:26.11]How long does it take to grow?
[22:28.05]Probably a little while, right?
[22:32.64]I'm just gonna go sleep.
[22:44.97]Deathbed stream.
[22:49.92]You know how fucked up that would really be, though?
[22:54.80]How are you getting out?
[22:58.90]Stop!
[23:00.71]I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.
[23:06.83]Can you imagine if, like, I, you know, I retire, whatever, and then you just don't really hear from me at all?
[23:14.63]I'd fall into complete irrelevancy over the course of, like, 40 years.
[23:21.57]And then one day, you're completely grown up too, in your 50s or 60s or 70s.
[23:32.44]And you get a notification on whatever device you have, you're still following, that I went live today.
[23:40.95]And it's me lying there, just like, I wanted to make sure I went out with everybody's here.
[23:47.49]On Twitch, I don't know where it would be.
[23:53.00]Would you guys be there?
[23:54.80]If you were, like, 75?
[23:55.48]Alright, I'll get enough money to make it up then.
[24:02.81]I don't know if you would.
[24:03.63]Okay, you'd probably look at your phone or your, you know, holographic fucking eye cameras and just be like, nah, I don't think so.
[24:13.43]You got too much going on.
[24:21.45]Okay.
[24:21.63]300 bucks.
[24:22.93]I need more food.
[24:23.65]That's... You're immoral.
[24:37.32]I mean, I'm not actually gonna stream the last moments of my life in a hospital.
[24:43.68]Like, why would I... I'm not gonna... When I'm like 100?
[24:46.03]No.
[24:46.15]No.
[24:49.63]Um, should I do a coop?
[24:54.97]I think so.
[25:04.60]Okay, I need chickens in there.
[25:06.06]I think I have too many, right?
[25:10.85]There are too many.
[25:14.79]I need way more food.
[25:15.69]I'll be back.
[25:20.66]Oh, he said immortal, not immoral.
[25:22.48]Yeah, I need way more food.
[25:39.82]Merch for your deathbed stream.
[25:49.10]That is fucked up.
[25:50.42]Alright, I need way more food.
[26:05.19]What is this?
[26:10.47]Is it oil?
[26:19.86]Get tombstone shirts.
[26:32.53]Ooh, okay.
[26:34.67]Can you mark anything on the map or you just have to kind of browse around?
[26:38.30]I'm going a little too far.
[26:40.20]Discover map data nodes across the range to uncover more of your map.
[26:52.84]These mushrooms?
[26:55.64]I need to upgrade.
[26:59.04]Honestly, I'm just trying to get as many carrots as I can.
[27:02.34]And, um... Get these two.
[27:10.24]You have to pay for the deathbed stream.
[27:15.14]Wait, there's a new... Hold on.
[27:18.85]Tabby slime.
[27:19.75]Oh, I remember these.
[27:23.10]Refinery?
[27:23.42]I can send stuff from the world to the farm?
[27:28.16]That's pretty cool.
[27:28.94]Okay.
[28:00.54]Oh, okay.
[28:01.08]It tells you what they like.
[28:02.40]Favorite is chickens.
[28:05.94]Doesn't really have a favorite.
[28:08.02]Favorite is blue ice cream or something, whatever it is.
[28:10.40]Okay.
[28:14.61]Water lettuce.
[28:15.87]Interesting.
[28:16.29]Okay.
[28:21.33]Okay.
[28:22.87]Okay.
[28:24.83]What if they ban you right before you do?
[28:26.61]Yeah, because I would be dying on camera, right?
[28:29.75]You're going to get the not like this disconnect thing.
[28:32.11]Can you imagine they caught it?
[28:36.28]Right at like... Right at like the flat line.
[28:50.83]Okay, I got to go back.
[28:56.93]Oh, can you mark stuff on the map?
[29:01.37]The stream's just gonna lag.
[29:02.63]You drop a bunch of frames.
[29:10.13]We come back from a disconnect.
[29:13.04]Community Jake, like, walks into the frame for a minute.
[29:16.28]Hey, Jerma, can you die again?
[29:18.08]We lost connection.
[29:20.90]I don't know, we lost, we DC'd.
[29:28.68]Alright, I got 20 carrots.
[29:29.70]I'm ready.
[29:33.90]What's that?
[29:35.02]Oh, that's the lettuce stuff.
[29:36.22]Don't touch that.
[29:36.74]That's mine.
[29:42.51]I want to grow that probably, right?
[29:46.13]Don't touch it.
[29:49.89]Water lettuce.
[29:50.51]I want to grow this.
[29:51.77]This is somebody's favorite, right?
[29:58.75]Yeah, I gotta grow this.
[30:00.98]Am I going the right way?
[30:08.85]Yeah.
[30:09.09]This game's fun.
[30:10.87]This game is just like the other one.
[30:12.31]Okay, here's the thing about Slime Rancher.
[30:16.41]Starting over in Slime Rancher was always like, I don't think I really want to do that.
[30:20.63]I think I've seen what the game is and I've seen everything I really want to do.
[30:24.00]Would I have loved to have memory wiped myself and played Slime Rancher 1 again?
[30:27.44]Because I love that initial kind of playing the plort market and making money and making pens and stuff.
[30:34.91]So this is, I just memory wiped and I'm playing Slime Rancher again.
[30:38.01]So this is great.
[30:38.67]I'm very, I'm very happy.
[30:46.61]Hey.
[30:47.83]Hey, sometimes people just want more and you just give them more.
[30:50.15]What's wrong with that?
[30:53.43]I bet you there's probably some new tools and stuff.
[30:59.65]The map's probably a lot bigger too, it feels like it.
[31:01.26]Alright, let's go.
[31:03.04]Alright, I'm back.
[31:12.22]I've got a bunch of carrots.
[31:15.30]Um, okay.
[31:15.94]Here you go.
[31:23.07]Well, don't jump out.
[31:23.85]You know what?
[31:31.48]You just... There's too many, so... But you should eat.
[31:34.30]I want you to eat something.
[31:46.29]Alright, 20.
[31:53.23]Was it worth?
[31:53.69]It went down?
[31:54.73]What the fuck?
[32:00.10]It was 11 bucks, now it's 10?
[32:01.48]Okay, I can do another...
[32:12.78]I swear to God, I thought this was Jerma in the casket.
[32:19.41]Okay, I think I've seen this before.
[32:21.49]But hold on.
[32:23.17]Does it already edit me into this?
[32:32.74]This looks like I'm... Am I edited into this picture?
[32:41.54]I thought this was Jerma in the casket.
[32:59.20]I swear to God, I thought this was Jerma in the casket.
[33:02.98]What is this?
[33:03.64]What movie is this from?
[33:42.91]No, don't.
[33:43.55]Oh, hold on.
[34:01.37]It's so hard to do this
[34:42.96]Alright, get this off the fucking screen.
[35:14.52]I'm still alive.
[35:16.41]But this chin is way too big.
[35:17.87]Hold on.
[35:19.89]Oh, I'm done.
[35:20.67]It's so, you know, it's like, you know how hard it is to make adjustments over here and be upside down?
[35:44.49]My soul, we're looking into each other's souls.
[35:55.22]No, no, no, wait, hold on.
[36:10.10]And I wake up.
[36:13.40]I have to go back into my body.
[36:21.33]I'm the spirit flying in, like... I'm in.
[36:25.71]And now it's me.
[36:28.23]I have to go back into my body!
[36:29.77]Alright, let's go.
[36:43.08]How big was this webcam?
[36:44.44]Like that?
[36:48.57]Okay.
[36:50.49]Jerma ghost?
[36:51.83]That is, like, fucked up, though.
[36:52.99]It actually does look ridiculous.
[36:58.59]Make it mirrored?
[36:59.32]No, I'm supposed to, like, go fly down, right?
[37:06.00]You did this bit three years ago.
[37:07.32]No, I didn't.
[37:08.68]Prove it.
[37:08.98]Hey, prove it.
[37:12.86]Don't you understand, like, it's a series of recycling a joke from five years ago over and over again?
[37:19.62]You did?
[37:21.08]When?
[37:27.65]Oh, when I... I was gonna say, when was I in a casket on stream doing, like, a routine where I fly back into my body?
[37:34.21]It's like that never happened.
[37:37.60]Oh, okay.
[37:38.00]I know what you mean.
[37:38.72]When I died on stream and I came out of the... Okay, I remember.
[37:42.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:43.42]I thought you meant that exact scenario right there.
[37:45.28]Okay.
[37:46.71]Yeah, I did do that.
[37:47.31]You're right.
[37:48.49]Alright.
[37:50.75]I want... I gotta make... I gotta get some chickens over here.
[37:59.57]Let's do another garden.
[38:01.53]Because I want to grow this water lettuce.
[38:03.33]Because it's the bunny's favorite, right?
[38:09.21]When was that?
[38:09.63]2018?
[38:09.65]2017?
[38:09.73]Because then I'm gonna put these guys over here.
[38:21.92]Alright, I gotta get more food.
[38:28.94]There are definitely way too many.
[38:31.28]But, whatever.
[38:32.42]This is before hit and run.
[38:36.90]Yeah, I would think so.
[38:37.66]There we go.
[38:39.44]Come here.
[38:39.76]Nice art.
[38:45.92]I need to put these in the pen.
[38:49.40]It was January 2019.
[38:50.10]Oh.
[38:50.30]Close enough.
[38:55.49]All the viewers...
[39:07.75]This game is pretty.
[39:08.45]It is really pretty.
[39:14.11]That's growing.
[39:14.83]I'll put the... Whose is the favorite?
[39:22.43]Thumbnail.
[39:22.85]The thumbnail.
[39:26.71]I don't get it.
[39:27.11]Alright.
[39:31.51]I want to know.
[39:32.17]No.
[39:34.67]That's not what I want.
[39:38.48]I think I just have to... I don't want to lose the... Whatever, I just gotta get more food until I can grow it myself.
[39:43.98]Let's go.
[39:47.52]Just more carrots, more fruits, more vegetables.
[39:49.62]I don't want to lose the cats, though.
[39:55.10]Suck in your cheeks, raise eyebrows, and smile at the camera.
[40:02.44]I don't get it.
[40:20.15]Can I touch my elbow?
[40:21.31]Yeah.
[40:27.11]Who cares?
[40:27.49]Alright, I'm just trying.
[40:42.92]I'm just getting food.
[40:43.56]That's all I want.
[40:45.10]I don't care about plorts right now.
[40:58.36]Just food is all I want.
[41:02.50]Can I fold my tongue?
[41:03.80]No.
[41:04.68]I can do this.
[41:07.34]I can't do anything.
[41:12.32]Oh no.
[41:18.41]Somebody said, can you fold your tongue?
[41:20.07]I said, no, I don't think I thought I could.
[41:32.04]You can't?
[41:32.52]Did it work?
[41:48.91]Stop.
[41:49.59]What?
[41:58.85]He's left brain, right brain Andy right now.
[42:02.94]Wouldn't that just mean a complete brain?
[42:08.90]Wouldn't that mean that I go, fine?
[42:12.82]Left brain, right brain Andy.
[42:14.38]What's it mean?
[42:16.94]You mean like one's taking control for five seconds and the other one takes over for five seconds?
[42:33.94]Oh, they had a test in high school saying stuff like, you're left-brained if you can roll your tongue, and vice versa.
[42:40.11]It was dumb.
[42:42.29]Oh, I see.
[42:42.83]Alright, let me get some money now.
[43:02.96]American education moment.
[43:11.20]I always forget which one is which.
[43:17.94]Left-brained is the analytical kind of mathematics one, right?
[43:22.11]And then right-brained is the more artistic, whatever it is.
[43:32.15]Reverse that, OK.
[43:41.32]It's crazy how we have all these theories and is there is there science to back that up?
[43:47.52]Is it like, oh yeah, by the way, that that is what it is.
[43:50.54]I wonder how much that gets refined in like another 100 years.
[43:56.89]Like, is how we view the brain and kind of our bodies right now going to turn into how we view people bleeding people because they had a cold?
[44:07.96]Like, oh yeah, you have the sniffles.
[44:10.43]Let's remove half your blood.
[44:12.57]Do you think that eventually, like in two, three, four hundred years, people are going to look back and be like, what were they talking about?
[44:20.88]Wait, they thought that they had a left and right brain?
[44:24.90]I bet it's going to be.
[44:25.62]It's weird thinking about that.
[44:27.86]Just like what is going to be completely outdate science and education wise in 100 years?
[44:33.27]Because we are going to be that group that looks back and goes, holy shit.
[44:36.65]Yeah.
[44:37.77]Oops.
[44:38.41]Fuck.
[44:42.60]In like 50 plus years, it's possible.
[44:49.64]No, maybe not in our lifetime.
[44:50.80]Maybe like another two lifetimes.
[44:57.91]Wee, you're the one that's 40, dude.
[44:59.51]Oh, okay.
[45:13.96]I'm not that old.
[45:16.46]Alright, I got 320.
[45:17.12]What's... Okay, it's time to make a pen and time to feed bunnies their favorite foods, which is water lettuce.
[45:23.14]Let's do it.
[45:24.92]This is where the money starts to actually roll here.
[45:26.52]Pretty, pretty big.
[45:41.22]Here you go.
[45:45.14]Look at, they love it.
[45:49.57]You're 20 years older than me.
[45:54.90]Dang.
[45:55.42]Alright, these are these are worth like 20 or 30, aren't they?
[46:11.59]You guys happy good.
[46:27.60]You're as old as my stepmom.
[46:49.37]Wait, these are a good value?
[46:50.64]Yep.
[46:54.42]Seven.
[46:54.92]Oh, hell yeah.
[46:56.68]Hell yeah.
[47:01.67]I said almost as old.
[47:05.51]Yeah, but how?
[47:07.49]What do you mean?
[47:08.05]Are we talking like 45?
[47:15.46]Because that's... I'm not even close.
[47:35.31]Alright, so now... I think it's time to go to sleep.
[47:45.47]How do I upgrade this stuff?
[47:47.97]Okay, here we go.
[47:50.55]Nutrient soil contains compost from the rainbow fields and minerals from Ember Valley.
[47:53.94]Makes crop always yield the maximum harvest.
[48:01.18]Grow twice as fast.
[48:02.16]I want that.
[48:02.58]So we're going to save up for it.
[48:09.16]So then so now from my understanding if I feed a You you feed a plort of a different Slime to a different slime and it becomes something else right so I take this and then I feed this to one of them over here Right, that's alright if I remember
[48:34.12]What are they doing?
[48:35.44]They're trying to escape.
[48:36.46]Okay, well, whatever.
[48:38.16]Well, I'm not going to do that yet.
[48:38.96]I don't think I'm prepared for that yet.
[48:42.51]So I'm going to go to bed.
[48:45.93]This game, I love this game.
[48:47.49]It's just as fun as the other one.
[48:49.13]It's just more of that.
[48:49.91]But it's somehow new.
[49:03.05]Let's go.
[49:04.03]How's the audio?
[49:04.57]Audio good?
[49:05.21]Is the sound high enough?
[49:06.55]Low enough?
[49:17.44]Nobody wants meat yet, so that's fine.
[49:19.12]Alright, I'm going to go out and do another... Another pull.

[52:50.51]Why do they call it oven when you in of out the cold food and in out hot eat the food?
[53:01.23]I don't know.

[54:22.27]Oh, this would be a great couch game.
[54:24.23]Just sitting on the couch.
[54:26.24]Oh, yeah.
[54:50.91]This puts me over the edge.
[54:51.81]Now I can do the faster growing.
[54:57.14]Yeah, it was made up.
[54:58.20]Okay.
[55:00.20]Look up Garfield, but minus Garfield.
[55:05.84]I have way better things to do with my time than that bullshit.
[55:09.16]Okay.
[55:15.02]Okay.
[55:15.14]Like beating carrots to slimes.
[55:17.70]Okay.
[55:31.38]The original comic is a fun comic.
[55:33.20]It makes John look crazy.
[55:49.81]I've actually seen it before and it's very funny.
[55:57.07]Wait, didn't somebody do Garfield, but as a Lovecraftian monster?
[56:06.21]There was a lot of Garfield material.
[56:12.30]It's all very funny.
[56:21.46]It's John just saying stuff to his pet cat.
[56:33.36]You know, but isn't that kind of already fucking happening?
[56:41.82]Isn't John just kind of talking to his cat?
[56:44.76]Is it even confirmed that Garfield can even really actually talk, right?
[56:48.23]Like, that's already happening.
[56:49.29]Like, John is just talking to nothing.
[56:53.25]That's already a thing.
[56:57.15]What's wrong with them all?
[57:05.03]Is something wrong?
[57:15.29]Veggie diet.
[57:16.37]This is not a vegetable?
[57:19.21]Oh, shit.
[57:20.25]Okay.
[57:21.13]It's a fruit.
[57:22.19]You're right.
[57:32.15]Does anybody have their favorite example of the Garfield-less John comic?
[57:44.94]One of the mods want to link me one?
[57:47.82]You guys want this.
[57:58.09]I'm just gonna let him go.
[57:59.01]This is way too many.
[58:05.76]Let me see this one.
[58:11.96]Oh my god, stop moving other stuff.
[58:28.73]Why is this locked?
[58:34.70]Remember the time yesterday when I almost ate a donut?
[58:53.53]These are fucking funny.
[58:54.93]Hold on, this one too?
[58:55.81]There's something wrong with my pants.
[59:01.97]I do this shit like every day.
[59:16.47]I like this one.
[59:22.91]Stop making toast.
[59:25.46]But is he making the toast?
[59:34.18]What the fuck is happening in this one?
[59:37.04]What is happening in this one?
[59:58.55]This one is so... This one's sad.
[60:00.79]This one's really sad.
[60:02.71]Oh my god, this is so awful.
[60:06.46]I'm gonna throw myself a surprise party.
[60:15.24]Gosh, I hope I don't suspect anything.
[60:17.07]Oh man.
[60:19.69]This is fucked up.
[60:29.76]He looks so happy in the second picture.
[60:31.58]Oh, poor John.
[60:35.44]No, those are fucking wild.
[60:43.04]What?
[60:45.34]Oh!
[60:46.42]Some of these are so bad.
[60:48.40]Some of these, I don't, oh, I don't like it.
[60:57.13]Okay, last one and then we're done.
[61:21.93]Yeah, those are fucking classic.
[61:25.57]Alright, let's go.
[61:26.95]You have some plorts and new bucks to spare.
[61:28.63]I don't get it?
[61:37.11]What do you mean you don't get it?
[61:39.65]Garfield's supposed to be on the chair.
[61:42.73]So they edited Garfield out of the chair, and Garfield's too lazy to get out of the chair, so he just drags the chair with Garfield in it to the vet.
[61:51.51]But you see that he's been removed, so he's just dragging a chair to the vet.
[61:55.89]And looks, um, a little, a little weird.
[61:58.83]So you get it, right?
[62:02.93]Alright, I got a lot of money.
[62:08.07]I gotta go to the lab.
[62:10.45]Underneath the conservatory?
[62:11.73]Alright, where is that?
[62:16.62]Do I have to go in the conservatory?
[62:24.28]How do I get down there?
[62:25.90]Oh.
[62:29.54]Feed them, feed them.
[62:31.06]I was too busy looking at funny Garfield-less comics.
[62:34.26]I'm sorry.
[62:36.81]This is what I'm talking about.
[62:48.67]What does this do?
[62:53.72]I don't want this yet.
[63:00.54]Oh, right.
[63:01.22]You can make shit.
[63:03.10]Alright.
[63:05.54]I need resources.
[63:06.24]Okay.
[63:06.43]What are you going to do?
[63:13.77]Garfield Shorts Movie Night?
[63:14.91]Okay.
[63:17.87]I don't know if what conspiracy you want to believe or what you want to look into or what what it is about Garfield but Garfield has stayed around he is the test of time has shown that Garfield is now a Super meme and people think Garfield's really funny and shit even even I unironically right or ironically Garfield
[63:41.91]There was the meme stuff that came over the last 10 years or so.
[63:46.15]And I don't think any other old comic strip like that has really stuck around in the mainstream kind of meme world like Garfield has.
[63:55.57]I'm trying to think if there's other ones.
[63:57.57]Not really.
[64:01.89]Dilbert?
[64:02.75]I don't know about Dilbert.
[64:03.83]I don't think so.
[64:11.64]peanuts yeah but the peanuts kind of the peanuts are sort of they have that new show right on whatever it is like like apple TV or something but but garfield took on this next level kind of ironic humor the peanuts don't have that the
[64:38.95]Garfield's kind of turned into Shrek.
[64:41.35]In a way.
[64:41.97]If that comparison makes sense.
[64:46.29]Or like Peter Griffin.
[64:48.18]Like Garfield turned into like Peter Griffin.
[64:49.92]Where people just kind of put him everywhere.
[64:52.50]Just as a funny joke.
[65:01.16]Alright, I gotta spend some money.
[65:10.15]Shrek is Shrek.
[65:13.37]Yeah, no, I mean, of course.
[65:14.27]I mean, Shrek is in the Library of Congress.
[65:17.71]This is one of the most important films ever made.
[65:20.47]But they've, okay, they're very hungry.
[65:21.87]Alright, I gotta, I gotta, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[65:24.60]Oh my god, what have I done?
[65:26.06]What's happening?
[65:27.56]Oh my god, I'm sorry.
[65:28.56]How do I, what do I do?
[65:29.82]Hold on.
[65:30.36]Everybody hold on.
[65:30.84]Relax, relax, relax.
[65:40.64]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[65:50.17]If I sneeze, then I'm going to come into $500 million with no strings attached at some point in the very near future.
[66:04.75]Oh, okay.
[66:05.89]Not going to happen.
[66:19.97]Alright, eat, eat, eat, eat, it's in there, come on.
[66:21.69]Alright, there we go.
[66:29.69]I was making, what do you mean?
[66:30.78]I was making a joke that if I sneezed right there, like I thought I was going to, because it was coming, that I'm gonna, if I sneeze, I get a million dollars, right?
[66:37.60]Because of the non sequitur.
[67:00.18]Irma hallucinates and thinks he owns a dog.
[67:03.34]Wait, this is pretty much what you just were looking at.
[67:05.40]Alright, I'm gonna leave him here.
[67:31.04]Hold on, turn this down.
[67:32.44]Have I ever seen this video?
[67:33.16]Alright, I'm going to leave him here.
[67:55.96]is this gonna be like a Toy Story scenario where like I leave the room he doesn't know that this recording he gets up and starts walking on two legs I'm not the dog this is not like dog I'm not the dog if you just got in here like a minute ago
[68:07.84]Why are you saying this?
[68:08.83]Why are you saying this?
[68:30.55]Alright, so you're probably asking, why am I doing this?
[68:33.77]No, yes I am.
[68:35.55]I am asking that, Jeremy.
[68:37.25]Well, I fucked up the sus.
[68:39.49]And the sus said there was a stream today.
[68:41.01]For the last two days.
[68:42.94]And I didn't even know there was a stream that was scheduled for today.
[68:47.30]Until, uh, like half an hour ago?
[68:50.54]40 minutes ago?
[68:51.28]Oh, come on.
[68:53.12]What's this?
[68:53.88]An update like that.
[68:54.58]There you go.
[68:55.06]Now you look better.
[68:56.78]I didn't know there was going to be a stream today, but now apparently there is.
[69:01.00]I told you guys that anybody that was in the fake pre-stream chat that we were going to do an auto-stream.
[69:08.87]It really is John Artbuckle.
[69:12.35]This is literally going to be like 30 minutes.
[69:13.91]I'm just doing this because I got guilt tripped by pre-stream.
[69:17.55]This is a guilt trip stream.
[69:21.08]Got me.
[69:22.00]Go there exactly.
[69:25.18]Here comes a full body reveal of the dog.
[69:27.60]Oh, no, never mind.
[69:32.51]I know what'll make you get up.
[69:34.09]He'll boo for his favorite toy, just you wait.
[69:35.90]A flamingo.
[69:38.18]See?
[69:40.52]Oh, dude, auto-reveal!
[69:42.58]I didn't get to, like, get the fuck out of the way.
[69:44.20]What if you just, like, shit on the carpet right now?
[69:48.53]Oh, hey, hey, don't do anything.
[69:51.11]Get daddy in trouble.
[69:54.23]Just like spins around and just like dumps right here.
[69:57.29]Did you see the finger?
[69:58.45]Look at the finger.
[70:00.53]Look at the finger.
[70:03.34]Look at this weird edited shit.
[70:06.86]Just like spins around and just like dumps right here.
[70:12.22]Is that a fake hand?
[70:17.87]Is this going to be like a Toy Story scenario where, like, I leave the room, he doesn't know that this is recording.
[70:22.76]He gets up and starts walking on fucking two legs.
[70:25.52]Oh, no, this is, I got to be the dog.
[70:27.06]I'm blocking the view of the dog.
[70:29.62]Hey.
[70:30.98]You that just joined the stream, welcome.
[70:33.20]Have we seen this?
[70:33.98]Today's, uh, subscriber, uh, what day is it?
[70:36.93]Tuesday.
[70:37.47]Today's, uh, welcome to Subscriber Wednesday.
[70:40.69]He's going to get me.
[70:43.33]He's going to get me.
[70:54.87]I'm not the dog.
[70:55.59]This is not like dog.
[70:56.73]I'm not the dog.
[70:57.39]If you just got in here like a minute ago.
[71:01.91]Stop putting this in my mouth.
[71:03.95]Stop rolling around.
[71:08.82]I can't seem to move.
[71:11.78]Please.
[71:12.66]You have to rescue me.
[71:17.24]I can't get up.
[71:19.20]I can't seem...
[71:26.73]This is so sad.
[71:27.97]No, it's not sad.
[71:29.45]The John Arbuckle ones were sad.
[71:32.01]This is normal human behavior.
[71:34.21]Those of you that are wondering, he wanted to eat the puke that may have come out of my mouth.
[71:53.52]That's enough of that.
[71:55.11]That's enough of that.
[71:57.76]That's enough of that.
[72:04.41]Completely normal behavior.
[72:06.99]Alright.
[72:07.95]Alright, okay, alright.
[72:14.14]What is that so sad?
[72:15.22]It's not sad.
[72:16.20]It's a funny joke.
[72:23.08]Oh my god, look at all this cash.
[72:39.24]I can't pick up more than one slot?
[72:41.21]Really?
[72:42.45]Why not?
[72:46.75]Prices are going down.
[72:49.99]But I need the money.
[73:09.15]Okay, everybody good?
[73:09.81]Everybody has been fed.
[73:14.05]Everybody's good.
[73:15.18]Head back over here.
[73:18.76]I'll go bring you guys some carrots.
[73:23.74]Get away from the...
[73:29.22]What is happening with these two?
[73:35.18]Why do they fuse together?
[73:36.30]Is that... Is this a new feature?
[73:43.87]Can they, like, fuse together?
[73:45.11]That's interesting.
[73:48.07]Okay.
[73:51.12]I need... Alright.
[73:52.14]I gotta...
[74:04.77]No, they're not.
[74:05.19]Alright, I'm going to... Come here.
[74:18.74]Okay, no, they weren't fused together.
[74:21.80]I'm going to get rid of a couple.
[74:23.90]Because I'm running out of the ability to feed everybody.
[74:26.73]So...
[74:34.92]I'm going to combine, because I don't want the pink florts anymore.
[74:39.80]We're going to do some combinations here.
[74:43.60]I'm going to do... Okay, there's too many.
[74:54.84]Just go be free over there somewhere.
[74:59.21]Who wants carrots?
[75:12.50]uh alright cool you can upgrade the uh yeah yeah I know I don't know how there that's how okay I'm gonna do one more poll and then I'm gonna buy a bunch of upgrades alright that's the last poll
[75:42.86]Chickens have to eat?
[75:45.11]I forget.
[75:45.47]Or they just kind of exist, right?
[75:46.73]Do you have to feed the chickens?
[75:51.57]No.
[75:51.87]No.
[75:52.01]Okay.
[75:54.09]Alright.
[75:56.03]I'm going to upgrade this pen.
[76:00.79]Okay.
[76:01.37]They can't bounce out.
[76:02.27]That's a good thing to have.
[76:03.25]Especially because the bigger ones are going to be here.
[76:11.40]That one's pretty good.
[76:15.46]That one's huge.
[76:18.46]Yeah, I want this one too.
[76:22.32]And then the auto feeder.
[76:23.82]Oh, auto!
[76:25.18]Is, uh... Be coming after that.
[76:27.89]Alright, everybody in.
[76:38.17]I am going to make them...
[76:42.05]I'm going to feed them these.
[76:44.71]Right?
[76:45.21]And we'll make a bunch of big ones.
[76:52.29]That sounds like a good idea.
[76:53.14]What's this?
[77:01.26]Oh.
[77:02.76]Hello?
[77:03.00]Hello?
[77:04.76]I'm sorry.
[77:05.74]Beatrix, do you read me?
[77:06.66]Testing, testing.
[77:07.46]Hmm, perhaps you're lost at sea, taken away.
[77:09.28]Oops, nope, just forgot to turn on the display.
[77:11.47]Nice to see your face again, Beatrix.
[77:14.03]I've missed you greatly, my dear friend.
[77:17.37]And while I'm quite excited for you to partake in a new adventure, I already have data that might complicate things.
[77:23.10]Last night I received a message from some sort of artificial intelligence program.
[77:26.08]It's written in code.
[77:27.62]But not one I recognize.
[77:29.66]I'm in the process of analyzing it.
[77:32.08]But I'm certain this message was sent from where you are now.
[77:35.26]Okay.
[77:36.20]Mysterious boat takes you to a mysterious island and has a mysterious code from a mysterious island.
[77:43.73]Curious.
[77:45.83]Well, thanks for literally zero info.
[77:50.77]Take this home portal.
[77:51.69]It should make the early stages of your journey easier.
[77:54.90]That's good.
[77:57.48]And teleport back to the town portal.
[78:00.42]Cool.
[78:05.85]Okay.
[78:07.95]It's time to make big pink bunnies?
[78:16.46]Will they still like the lettuce that I'm making?
[78:20.91]I wonder.

[78:31.56]Okay.
[78:32.36]So, I need some... I'm gonna go to bed.

[79:16.38]Are they eating each other?
[79:20.10]What just happened?
[79:24.00]They eat... Okay.
[79:26.36]Tabby slimes eat meat.
[79:27.45]Alright, here we go.
[79:44.25]It's gonna start to get crazy in here.
[80:04.91]Oh, and lettuce is ready.
[80:28.33]Okay.
[80:30.63]Cotton Tappy Largo.
[80:33.11]Alright, veggies and- They're gonna get out.
[80:35.47]I need to buy that thing.
[80:38.87]Oh no, that's bad.

[80:42.90]Oh shit.
[80:46.74]Okay, hold on.
[80:48.16]Air net.
[80:54.40]I need some money.
[81:06.62]I gotta get the air net.
[81:12.15]Is this game worth it?
[81:13.25]100% yes.
[81:17.54]If you actually, honestly, if you've never played it, how much content is in the early access?
[81:28.78]425.
[81:30.28]A lot.
[81:30.86]Okay.
[81:31.42]Is it almost feature complete, would you say?
[81:33.90]It's at least 15 hours.
[81:36.00]Alright, well then yeah.
[81:36.96]Then 100% is worth it.
[81:47.52]I know I'm coming with some food.
[81:54.54]I need more chickens.
[81:55.26]Alright, I'm gonna go on a chicken run.
[81:59.02]Elder rooster.
[81:59.88]Okay, well.
[82:03.59]Okay, tabby port.
[82:11.15]What are these worth?
[82:14.44]Alright, where's the thing that collects the florts?
[82:21.40]There it is.
[82:25.87]Okay.
[82:28.39]Alright, cool.
[82:37.02]Let's go.
[82:37.38]28.
[82:37.40]That's worth a lot.
[82:37.94]Alright.
[82:38.36]Let me get a roof on this.
[82:41.00]I think there's too many.
[82:42.49]Are there too many?
[82:48.61]Are there too many in here?
[82:52.89]I think so, yeah.
[82:58.97]Alright, I need to go and do some exploring.
[83:04.29]Oh, the carrot's not done.
[83:05.20]Alright, I need to go explore.
[83:12.52]I gotta get some stuff.
[83:20.92]I'm going on a generic food run.
[83:26.70]I'm going to head here and then to the left.
[83:30.13]Food run.
[83:33.31]Okay.
[83:57.57]Has he done the beatbox thing yet?
[83:59.04]I think so.
[84:06.44]Yeah, chickens, fruits, vegetables, everything.
[84:09.50]Anything I can get.
[84:10.10]Okay, yep.
[84:22.79]Is this thing...
[84:25.94]I want 20 of each.
[84:28.14]I got to get ahead of myself here.
[84:31.26]Otherwise, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.
[84:32.56]I just am.
[84:44.49]Odd.
[84:52.02]Decoration?
[84:57.39]Oh, I'm in this area now.
[84:58.51]Alright, where's one of those map pods?
[84:59.91]I have a question.
[85:07.78]So... Okay, a very important question.
[85:14.51]I keep getting on my YouTube homepage.
[85:17.93]Just, I open up YouTube and there it is.
[85:21.03]Gatorade pod videos.
[85:24.39]What is this?
[85:25.88]What is a Gatorade pod?
[85:31.17]You should watch it.
[85:32.97]It's Gatorade, these little globes that people like into this container.
[85:41.46]It's not a Gatorade.
[85:42.38]It's like a Gatorade syrup that you put into a, a, I guess a, a travel kind of sip thing.
[85:55.45]I'm trying to figure out what the application for that is.
[86:01.09]It's a make your own Gatorade.
[86:04.63]Right, but why not just buy a Gatorade?
[86:08.77]Is it cheaper?
[86:10.43]What is it?
[86:13.71]Oh, I have like the red Gatorade syrup that I turn it upside down and like into this special device that has to puncture the thing.
[86:21.90]Why not just buy a red Gatorade?
[86:28.00]It's less plastic.
[86:30.28]No, it is expensive.
[86:31.34]It is?
[86:37.71]Wait, those are good.
[86:44.09]It's a reusable bottle and you can dilute it.
[86:53.89]Maybe less plastic.
[86:54.95]One bottle in small pods.
[86:57.85]Wouldn't, like, powder with, like, a paper kind of, like, you know, a paper container be better than a plastic pod?
[87:08.36]But it just wouldn't be, powder would be bad or something.
[87:13.00]I mean, it's still, I just keep seeing these videos and I'm just like, what is, this is Gatorade pods?
[87:24.90]That works, so just Kool-Aid.
[87:28.42]I mean, yeah, but does Kool-Aid have electrolytes?
[87:31.38]Or is it just like food coloring and sugar?
[87:33.94]I don't think Kool-Aid is a Gatorade.
[87:43.22]It's like yummy, delicious flavoring and sugar.
[87:47.38]And food coloring.
[87:54.31]It's less waste overall because it's a reusable bottle.
[87:58.33]Alright, I get it.
[87:59.03]Okay.
[88:01.06]So it's a way for Gatorade to be like, hey, look, we have all these plastic bottles and we're going to shrink our bottles to like 10% the size.
[88:13.70]And you have to turn it upside down and like load it.
[88:17.42]It's almost like a little canister.
[88:20.04]It's weird.
[88:21.56]This thing eats fruit?
[88:23.04]Oh, no.
[88:24.36]I'll come back here.
[88:25.60]Where is this?
[88:26.48]Right here.
[88:39.61]There was a specific reason why I came out here, and it was to collect 20 of each food.
[88:43.93]And I'm gonna stick to it.
[88:46.13]Alright, I'm pretty close.
[88:50.11]I just need some more chickens.
[88:51.09]I got enough chickens, that's fine.
[88:59.40]The reason he's getting it on YouTube is that there's a big marketing push for it.
[89:02.66]Should I try it?
[89:09.55]Do you want me to do like a Gatorade pod stream review?
[89:21.87]No.
[89:26.83]Alright, I brought food.
[89:44.70]Oh yeah, this is gonna be huge now.
[89:46.06]Look at how much money I'm about to make.
[89:51.04]They seem to want you just to do Kool-Aid instead.
[89:55.12]What was the... What was the tier list that I want to do when I'm just sitting there IRL?
[90:00.13]Oh, cheese!
[90:00.59]I want to do a cheese tier list.
[90:01.75]Because of all the goat cheese bullshit.
[90:10.93]Alright, can I get in there?
[90:21.41]Yeah, I wanted to do a cheese tier list.
[90:24.62]I talked about this with Holly.
[90:26.58]She was like, you're going to shit your pants.
[90:27.88]I was like, no, no, no.
[90:29.92]It's going to be cubes.
[90:31.60]Little cubes.
[90:34.07]Of each one.
[90:43.98]Alright, this'll put me in... gonna be a lot of money here.
[90:46.48]This is gonna be a big payday.
[90:53.85]I gotta upgrade this pen.
[90:54.75]This pen kinda sucks.
[91:01.21]I mean, if I do it... correct.
[91:04.13]I mean, I was okay on the last one.
[91:05.90]I will say I felt a little odd after eating all that random shit.
[91:12.30]You need at least two to three variants of goat cheese to get a real... I promise I will get real goat cheese.
[91:18.34]I will get the good stuff.
[91:19.52]I had a big argument with the mods, by the way.
[91:21.94]There was a blowout in the mod chat on the Discord.
[91:29.52]I was told that my opinions were absolutely fucking meaningless.
[91:33.22]They were disgusted that I said that goat cheese tasted like dirt.
[91:37.10]And it was a blowout.
[91:40.21]Um, so I was told there's, there's specific goat cheese you need to eat.
[91:43.65]Don't just eat the random shit from like the random restaurant that puts it on top.
[91:48.41]Um, so I agreed.
[91:49.27]I said, okay, I will eat a specific good one.
[91:53.89]Uh, and we'll see how I feel.
[91:57.38]And it's gotta be a blind taste test.
[91:59.08]Okay.
[92:01.30]Okay.
[92:02.18]That's fine.
[92:07.82]I'm gonna know when it's goat cheese because I'm gonna want to puke when I eat it.
[92:13.66]This is not a Coke versus Pepsi scenario.
[92:16.19]This is a Coke versus... This is a Coke versus a can of creamed corn that I have to drink.
[92:26.04]I'm gonna tell.
[92:37.67]What's wrong with cream corn?
[92:38.95]It's just so different and so gross.
[92:57.81]Hey, get out of here.
[92:58.96]Get out of here.
[93:00.10]You're not supposed to be over here.
[93:12.10]You know, I actually don't... When was the last time I had creamed corn?
[93:17.23]For all the people in the chat that are calling me, eh, what the fuck, dude?
[93:20.41]You creamed corn?
[93:21.17]You elitist creamed corn?
[93:23.77]I mean, when was the last time you ate creamed corn?
[93:25.69]I don't think you even could tell me.
[93:27.57]I couldn't.
[93:30.90]I don't...
[93:32.28]When was the last time you ate a can of creamed corn?
[93:42.44]Today, pleb.
[93:43.28]Was it good?
[93:47.24]Never in my whole life, LMAO.
[93:51.20]Never in my life.
[93:54.62]I feel like I've had... Okay, it's not bad.
[93:56.80]It's just kind of a little off-putting.
[94:03.85]Cream corn is good.
[94:08.49]I don't remember the last time I even had it.
[94:11.73]Had to have been mixed in with something else.
[94:13.53]Like a casserole or something.
[94:14.65]Like a Thanksgiving casserole.
[94:15.73]I don't know.
[94:19.39]One of your subs is named cream corn.
[94:21.23]You better be nice.
[94:23.31]I didn't say that it was bad.
[94:25.49]I just said I didn't.
[94:26.48]But I said it was kind of gross.
[94:27.38]But it is.
[94:30.68]It tastes fine.
[94:44.88]Oh, that's good.
[94:50.03]We definitely want to make this better.
[94:53.73]Music box.
[94:57.47]Cream corn tier list.
[94:59.37]Everyone is pinging me.
[95:00.31]Omega LOL.
[95:01.11]You put cream corn in F tier during the Thanksgiving tier list last stream.
[95:04.66]I did?
[95:16.30]Um, I should probably get this, right?
[95:17.71]Yeah.
[95:25.45]That's a 46-month sub, and that's the treatment you're giving a 46-month sub?
[95:29.39]Um...
[95:46.43]Alright, money's gonna start flowing here.
[95:51.14]You guys are alright.
[95:55.36]I think I need to take care of you.
[95:57.58]Oh, you know, they've been fed.
[95:59.42]They've been fed.
[95:59.86]I should apologize.
[96:03.53]I mean, I'm... No!
[96:08.49]No!
[96:09.57]I'm not going to.
[96:13.39]I don't like cream corn.
[96:16.16]I would not eat it from a can.
[96:18.28]I would not eat it with a fan.
[96:21.59]I would not eat it in your house.
[96:24.15]I wouldn't even eat it with a mouse.
[96:27.20]I wouldn't eat it here or there.
[96:28.44]I wouldn't eat it with a bear.
[96:45.00]I can't rhyme any other words.
[96:46.26]I don't know.
[96:46.93]Pretend like I did a little bit more.
[96:53.67]And then I eat it.
[96:54.87]And I'm like.
[97:03.90]You wouldn't eat with a mouse?
[97:04.90]No.
[97:05.18]Okay.
[97:07.46]I need more.
[97:10.20]Of.
[97:12.63]I think I need to separate some of these out.
[97:15.29]Cause they're- they're- I do know the pen.
[97:20.70]I'll get one ready.
[97:27.94]I would not eat it on a bus.
[97:29.26]As you know, that would make me sus.
[97:32.42]Yeah, but you had time to come up with that.
[97:34.93]You had time to sit there and go.
[97:35.99]I didn't have that opportunity.
[97:45.49]Let's get some of the nighttime ones.
[97:59.72]Maybe I should go to sleep.
[98:00.46]Alright, I'm gonna go sleep.
[98:08.15]Mods are saying that they're a good chatter.
[98:17.20]Alright, this is really funny to me, but they're a good chatter.
[98:23.35]They've only been timed out... Now think about this, right?
[98:26.75]Just think about this.
[98:30.71]A mod is telling me... No, they're a good chatter.
[98:32.63]They're good.
[98:33.23]There are no problems.
[98:34.68]There's nothing fucked up.
[98:36.48]Okay, whatever.
[98:37.40]They've only been timed out 91 times.
[98:44.86]That seems like kind of a lot.
[98:51.92]That just goes to show you how much you guys misbehave here.
[98:58.72]Look how much you guys misbehave.
[99:03.88]Most frequent chatters have over a thousand timeouts.
[99:11.10]Over a 999 plus timeouts for a frequent chatter here.
[99:19.65]That is actually an incredible ratio.
[99:24.05]Wow.
[99:27.46]I'm sitting here thinking, oh, maybe if you got timed out like twice.
[99:32.00]No.
[99:34.30]A thousand?
[99:35.18]Some of you guys have been timed out over a thousand times.
[99:44.33]I'm sorry.
[99:55.90]It's Nightbot.
[99:56.80]Fuck the caps limit.
[99:59.12]Well, dude, if you get timed out for caps 500 times, you're going to get timed out of 500 and first time for a thousand times a lot.
[100:09.20]If I got timed out a thousand times in a chat room, I'd probably be like, I'm probably going to get fucking banned.
[100:19.39]One of my mods has been timed out 999 plus times.
[100:24.53]Wait, what?
[100:27.35]No, you, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[100:28.59]Okay, okay.
[100:29.53]No, let's air it out.
[100:32.41]Let's air it out.
[100:33.59]We got 18 timeouts from one of the mods.
[100:38.43]Do you want me to tell you who these are?
[100:39.69]Should I tell you who these are?
[100:43.34]Are you guys comfortable with that?
[100:51.44]Okay.
[100:51.96]Ooh.
[100:54.15]Oh, VRJosh.
[100:56.17]VRJosh has been timed out 34 times.
[100:58.07]Dude.
[101:06.61]One was a personal one from you.
[101:10.28]Wait, I timed you out personally?
[101:18.13]I'm interested.
[101:18.63]Alright, Grump, what's yours?
[101:21.81]How many times have you been timed out?
[101:31.87]Oh, wow.
[101:33.11]We currently have a leader.
[101:34.53]We currently have a leader right now.
[101:35.83]Who's number one in regards to timeouts here?
[101:43.48]Okay.
[101:45.92]Kumakisu has three.
[101:49.28]Three timeouts.
[101:52.28]Grump has never been timed out.
[101:56.56]Ever.
[101:57.20]Once.
[101:57.86]Ever.
[102:00.60]Ever.
[102:01.82]In like seven years.
[102:03.74]Wow.
[102:08.00]That's actually remarkable.
[102:16.97]Wow.
[102:18.23]Not once?
[102:21.71]Unable to be timed out.
[102:23.07]Immune.
[102:23.75]Not fair.
[102:25.33]You can't be timed out.
[102:29.86]Giga chat.
[102:31.16]Zero.
[102:32.10]No, wouldn't the giga chat be the person that's on my mod team that has like 900 timeouts, right?
[102:38.68]I feel like that's giga chat, right?
[102:40.65]Like, I don't give a shit.
[102:41.87]I've been timed out a thousand times.
[102:46.01]So that means, yeah, that means that... I'm very curious about this.
[102:50.99]This is funny.
[102:52.69]Is there a way...
[102:53.96]No, I don't want to do this, but this is kind of funny internally, maybe.
[102:56.30]Is there a way for the mods to know who in chat right now has the most timeouts ever that's here right now?
[103:03.08]Because, like, I think that's funny.
[103:06.33]Who is the ultimate timeout, Andy?
[103:09.01]Do we know?
[103:10.77]We can't see more than 999.
[103:20.31]There's internal stats on Twitch, probably.
[103:22.77]Oh, we can't see it.
[103:23.57]We can only see 999.
[103:24.69]Polly's been timed out 11 times.
[103:41.26]But, but a thousand.
[103:44.40]Those of you thousand plus Gigachads, you know what I'm saying?
[103:49.70]You've been timed out in this channel over 999 fucking times.
[103:52.90]Oh, here we go.
[104:15.38]That's so funny.
[104:20.10]Don't the glowing slimes need to be somewhere else?
[104:22.70]Don't they need to be in the underground or something?
[104:28.75]So they're not in the sunlight?
[104:31.87]That's how it worked in the first game.
[104:37.59]Almost all of it is nightbot.
[104:38.91]I mean, I would imagine it would be.
[104:45.70]They have solar shields for... Okay, good to know.
[104:48.26]Thank you.
[104:51.66]Oh, you're big.
[104:54.42]Let's get a few of... I don't want to do any combinations yet.
[104:58.00]We'll start with seven.
[105:02.32]Cool looking, though.
[105:03.48]Cool looking.
[105:06.28]I think... Isn't Nightbot broken right now, too?
[105:14.54]Don't I have a weapon to get rid of those?
[105:15.58]Alright, I'm going to go... Let's go this way.
[105:27.26]Is water death?
[105:38.19]How do I get rid of these?
[105:41.83]Isn't there like a gun or something I can use?
[105:52.94]It's water.
[105:53.46]I don't have it yet.
[105:54.16]Okay.
[105:56.72]Alright, I... What do I want to do now?
[106:11.98]What do they eat?
[106:13.74]What do you guys eat?
[106:14.86]They eat fruits.
[106:15.72]Alright, I have fruits.
[106:17.04]I need to upgrade.
[106:19.69]I need to upgrade my pens bad now.
[106:35.14]Alright.
[106:36.46]Is that also that big guy down there, right?
[106:51.54]Okay.
[106:53.96]So, let's do this.
[106:57.60]What kind of plorts are these?
[107:00.39]Oh, 34.
[107:00.47]Yep.
[107:01.21]I'll take it.
[107:04.17]Okay.
[107:13.76]Oh, they can jump right out of here.
[107:15.10]Shit.
[107:16.00]It's okay.
[107:16.44]Okay.
[107:19.90]No, guys, guys, guys, guys, come on.
[107:35.45]Stop.
[107:35.81]425?
[107:36.53]Your hairline is crooked.
[107:46.86]No, it's because this hair... Look.
[107:51.83]My hairline's not crooked.
[107:52.67]It's just this is falling over this way.
[107:57.87]By the way, congratulations on your 998th timeout.
[108:01.01]Whoever said that.
[108:11.72]Why are they... Oh my god, I forgot.
[108:13.76]They're in the sun.
[108:19.06]I need the sun shield thing.
[108:27.00]That's a lot.
[108:33.03]Um, oh my god.
[108:34.01]Okay, hold on.
[108:34.77]I got a lot of stuff going on.
[108:39.59]What are these worth?
[108:40.29]Only 19.
[108:40.73]That's it?
[108:50.79]Okay.
[108:59.61]I gotta feed them too.
[109:00.91]They're probably... Yeah, they're hungry.
[109:01.93]35!
[109:01.95]Damn.
[109:02.23]Alright, hold on a second.
[109:04.01]Okay.
[109:12.31]Looking good.
[109:13.65]I need more plorts.
[109:18.29]Be right back.
[109:34.94]Alright, I got money to work with now.
[109:40.63]Where are your eyebrows?
[109:42.09]I have a big brow bone.
[109:44.17]It messes them up.
[110:11.01]1600 bucks.
[110:12.53]Let's go.
[110:17.31]Let's go.
[110:24.38]This needs way... This has got to go way faster.
[110:27.88]Soil.
[110:28.32]I'm going to have... I need fruits.
[110:31.10]So I'm going to do this too.
[110:34.78]I have two slimes that eat fruits.
[110:41.78]Okay, that's good.
[110:43.02]That'll produce much faster.
[110:45.58]Let's go.
[110:46.10]Alright.
[110:53.73]Right.
[110:53.93]Okay, I need the solar shield.
[110:59.93]Sensitive to light.
[111:01.41]And then let's make the height more too.
[111:04.73]Okay.
[111:05.57]Alright.
[111:05.95]Now you guys hopefully can't fly out.
[111:08.57]Maybe you can.
[111:10.20]I hope not.
[111:14.83]How you guys doing over here?
[111:15.47]Good?
[111:20.81]Alright, this is automatically doing it.
[111:22.43]Good.
[111:24.04]Okay.
[111:25.44]I don't think they can get out.
[111:26.18]I think we're good.
[111:30.02]We're safe in there.
[111:30.68]How come your wig is crooked?
[111:38.09]My wig?
[111:46.28]Oh.
[111:49.98]Alright, we're gonna do one more pull.
[111:51.96]One more pull.
[111:55.52]Because there's a bunch of, uh, plorts to get.
[111:58.56]Alright, suck it up already.
[112:06.44]Let's go.
[112:14.72]Suck it up already!
[112:28.09]cool let's go this way so they eat fruits and their um florts are worth a lot right 34 I gotta really start to get more of those they're okay in here for now no one's having a problem they're all fine
[112:55.37]I don't want anything else, do I?
[112:56.31]Do I want something else here?
[112:58.95]No, this is the best pen that I have.
[113:01.75]Yeah, so I gotta keep that in mind.
[113:05.15]Looking for a pole?
[113:05.71]No, I think I may have just said something that sounded like pole.
[113:12.06]Perfect!
[113:14.30]This is ready.
[113:22.59]So this is a vegetable.
[113:24.15]I'm going to replace this with a fruit because I have vegetables here and these are better, higher quality.
[113:36.07]Pull all the carrots out.
[113:37.01]I need a fruit.
[113:40.17]I'm going to go try to find like a high quality fruit.
[113:44.11]Come here, come here.
[113:50.61]Come here, come here.
[113:51.35]Food's in here.
[114:01.36]There you go.
[114:04.04]Yeah, eat up.
[114:04.59]I tried to make it.
[114:16.79]Alright.
[114:18.39]I'm on a mission for a really cool, delicious fruit.
[114:23.87]Maybe backwards.
[114:24.40]Because I want to replace the carrots.
[114:36.86]Eat it up.
[114:37.38]That's right.
[114:39.96]I cannot go this way.
[114:41.08]Never mind.
[114:48.74]Because there's the pog fruit.
[114:51.38]But there's probably something else too, right?
[114:52.82]It has to be.
[114:56.48]Q berry is probably the best thing to find in this area.
[114:58.20]Maybe I'll look for it.
[115:02.27]Or is it?
[115:10.52]Alright.
[115:11.64]Fruits.
[115:13.64]Fruits or chickens.
[115:15.06]Eventually I'm going to need a lot of chickens, I think.
[115:25.39]I think I'm just going to head to the unexplored area.
[115:31.72]That's probably the best idea.
[115:36.09]Just in case, I'm going to pick these up.
[115:37.57]There's a very real possibility I don't find any fruit.
[115:42.42]And if that's the case, I will punch through my monitor as hard as I can.
[115:50.11]Because, like, I can't believe I didn't find any fruit.
[116:07.31]The people egging me on, by the way.
[116:12.44]Come on, Gwen.
[116:14.66]Come on.
[116:22.90]I actually don't remember the last time I truly tried to break something like that because of, I don't know.
[116:30.17]The only thing I can think of is when I used to play Super Nintendo or some Nintendo game back when I'm younger.
[116:37.41]And I told you this before, but you grip the controller so hard and you try to, like almost like you're tearing it in half and you're just like, and all you hear is like just components crackling inside the controller.
[116:49.00]It's just, you're like, alright, I'm fine.
[116:54.08]Just the crunches inside, yeah.
[117:06.98]But no, I... Like, throw in a controller or something into the screen or into the wall.
[117:14.32]No, my brain thinks probably five to ten minutes ahead a lot of times like that.
[117:20.94]And...
[117:23.74]I just, if, I, there's a hole in your, I have to fix that.
[117:27.94]I, like, the drywall is fucked up now.
[117:31.67]That's a whole project.
[117:33.13]That's a whole weekend project now that I'm making for myself.
[117:38.63]I have to, how do you fix a hole in drywall YouTube video?
[117:42.36]Okay.
[117:43.88]Alright, I need to go get, like, plaster.
[117:45.74]I need to go get this material.
[117:47.56]I have to, I don't want to do, I don't want to do that.
[117:50.88]No.
[117:52.73]My rage is contained by how lazy I am to do household maintenance.
[117:58.83]Sorry.
[118:06.38]If throwing a controller onto the ground, boom, it blows up.
[118:10.82]Pieces kind of go everywhere.
[118:12.24]I don't want to do that.
[118:16.12]I mean, I got a dog, right?
[118:18.36]I don't want to.
[118:19.67]What if like auto is nearby or something, right?
[118:23.89]Oh, what if, like, a week later, I don't get all the pieces and I step on it?
[118:28.13]I don't, you know, I'm not, I don't, mm-mm.
[118:33.56]Oh, trust me, there have been times.
[118:35.42]Oh, yeah, there have been times when I have just been like, I want to fucking eat this.
[118:44.28]I want to smash this thing.
[118:50.14]But it's just, it's built out of this idea that I don't want to do the housework that required afterwards.
[118:58.66]I don't know, maybe I should get a, like a foam controller.
[119:04.01]Do they make those?
[119:07.35]Do they make little, like kind of squishy toy controller things for your controller?
[119:14.12]Because what if you just threw that and it was just like a nerf controller?
[119:17.72]Yeah.
[119:18.72]The nerf controller is real.
[119:26.41]If I went over somebody's house and instead of just two or three regular PlayStation 5 controllers, they had these foam made out of clay controllers and that's all they had, I'd be like, you need to work on your temper.
[119:43.49]You're like, why do you own, why do you have these?
[119:49.34]I'm anticipating that that control is going to get thrown tonight while we are here at your house.
[120:00.00]Okay, these guys, I need, what did I do with all the fruit that I just had?
[120:13.29]What did I do with all the fruit that I just had in my pocket?
[120:18.21]Oh, I fed the big guy.
[120:19.79]God damn it.
[120:20.47]I did, didn't I?
[120:23.73]Shit.
[120:33.26]Alright.
[120:34.36]It's time.
[120:35.14]It's time to set the pink slimes free because they're not... The money is not worth very much.
[120:42.00]And I want to make room for the next group.
[120:44.14]And we're going to set them free.
[120:54.54]Good luck, guys.
[120:56.86]Thanks for being the start of the business.
[121:01.54]Excellent work.
[121:20.51]Okay, over here with your friends, and there's a big patch of carrots here.
[121:24.44]See you guys later.
[121:25.10]Thanks for... Thanks for coming to the stream, guys.
[121:27.66]Appreciate it.
[121:28.94]Thanks for hanging out.
[121:29.40]Thanks for the bits.
[121:30.68]Yep.
[121:31.86]Thank you.
[121:32.14]Alright, I want a few more of these.
[121:48.47]These are currently the most expensive.
[121:57.37]Should I do more than 10 or 20 in one thing?
[121:59.87]I don't think so.
[122:06.13]Although, that's a big pen.
[122:07.27]I can fit a lot.
[122:07.89]Might as well.
[122:10.77]And then I have to get fruits.
[122:13.29]No bullshit.
[122:15.42]Fruits.
[122:22.00]There we go.
[122:33.08]Okay.
[122:40.46]Cute slime.
[122:41.28]Yeah.
[122:43.37]This is vegetable, but whatever.
[122:44.47]I'll take it.
[122:55.40]I already got a bunch of those.
[122:59.84]Ooh, what's that?
[123:02.45]Fruits.
[123:02.77]There we go.
[123:03.23]Finally.
[123:13.72]Chicken.
[123:14.02]I don't need this lettuce.
[123:17.34]I'll take some more chickens.
[123:27.77]Hmm.
[123:32.94]Alright, I have a ton of these.
[123:36.06]Alright, I have 20.
[123:37.12]That's probably way too much, but whatever.
[123:47.64]Oh, that's a little... What's that?
[123:56.43]Ooh.
[123:59.63]Okay.
[124:02.87]So there's this little area over here.
[124:04.41]I think I gotta go back.
[124:13.23]Wait.
[124:25.80]Cool.
[124:28.98]Just pick up the pink plorts.
[124:34.28]Might as well.
[124:38.32]Root?
[124:40.20]Oh, shit.
[124:40.52]Tons of chickens, too.
[124:41.24]Not the right chickens.
[124:55.50]Shit.
[124:56.19]Um... I want the chickens.
[125:00.43]They're gonna be so important.
[125:01.59]It's very soon here once I need to actually start getting meat
[125:07.62]Probably make a second pen.
[125:15.41]What's my favorite book?
[125:21.33]Um, is it a meme for me to say, um, one of the Song of Ice and Fire books?
[125:32.12]That's probably the last real book that I read.
[125:39.01]It's funny how that turned me off to reading books, like, forever.
[125:43.67]I've read every single Song of Ice and Fire book.
[125:47.14]I was so into it.
[125:48.90]And then I just, like, I was like, oh, the other book is, like, just never coming out.
[125:53.90]I'm never reading ever again.
[125:54.88]Okay, time to go back.
[126:07.77]I can start building the fruit here.
[126:09.45]Of course, it's the Game of Thrones book.
[126:40.75]Show teeth so we can prove you have cigarette stains.
[126:42.67]I don't think so.
[127:08.55]Your teeth are made out of plastic.
[127:13.38]Alright, let's put in... Ooh, wait.
[127:23.16]There we go.
[127:23.50]Alright, fog fruit going in.
[127:34.69]Is this fully upgraded?
[127:35.55]I don't think... I don't want to do that.
[127:41.64]Alright, so I got fruits coming...
[127:44.71]I have a bunch of chickens now.
[127:46.45]I have too many chickens.
[127:50.19]So I gotta be ready for this.
[127:51.69]Alright.
[127:51.95]Good to go.
[127:53.62]Cool.
[127:55.92]Looks good.
[127:56.46]Let's feed you.
[128:03.24]Get some good shit.
[128:19.08]and then what should I should I combine uh should I make I don't know what should I combine next I'm not I don't think I'm gonna put these the oh nice okay
[128:46.14]I think they could fit in here for now.
[128:47.10]I'm just going to go right to bed.
[128:53.53]Okay, now I need a music box.
[129:01.37]And automatic feeder.
[129:02.51]Alright, we're going to put a bunch of fruits in here.
[129:06.31]I think.
[129:23.45]Showing your teeth is a threat.
[129:27.23]I'm a dog or something?
[129:28.33]I think you're a dog.
[129:45.48]Mm-mm.
[129:46.33]I ain't doing it.
[129:47.25]I ain't doing it.
[129:48.43]I know the meme.
[129:49.35]I know I've read it a thousand times.
[129:50.93]I'm not gonna do it.
[129:51.45]I'm not gonna do it.
[129:51.85]And then I do like a snarl into the camera.
[129:54.73]I refuse.
[129:56.28]I'm not doing it.
[130:05.79]Alright, come on.
[130:06.33]Hurry up.
[130:08.53]New quest?
[130:13.02]What do you know?
[130:13.66]Beatrix LeBou, off on another rival adventure.
[130:17.20]Rival adventure.
[130:18.18]Why did I add a word?
[130:19.04]I don't get it.
[130:25.27]Why did I do that?
[130:27.31]And we'll... And didn't think to take her good pal, sometimes rival...
[130:33.91]And Forever Mentor?
[130:36.18]What is happening?
[130:37.64]Why did I... Why did I go like this?
[130:41.34]Well, what do you know?
[130:42.48]Beatrix LeBou off on another rival advent... Why did I go like this?
[130:47.34]That was weird.
[130:50.20]Okay, seriously, next time you go off running off to dangerous, uncharted territory, could you at least give me a heads up?
[130:57.14]Okay.
[131:00.37]Help collect all those valuable resources that seem to be scattered all over the island.
[131:05.29]What, you think I wasn't gonna do a little recon of my own?
[131:08.49]What good are surveillance statistics?
[131:16.85]If they can't snoop on stuff, why am I making words up?
[131:22.16]Anyway, be careful out there.
[131:23.72]The island gives me a kind of weird vibe, so I'm going to keep poking around.
[131:30.34]is why I don't read I I have been waiting for the winds of winter for 10 years I stopped reading books and I've lost the ability to comprehend reading okay since I know you're starting from scratch out there take this refinery link should you make things easier for you
[131:59.82]Bro, I gotta be honest.
[132:02.04]The only reading I've done is just reading the back of cereal boxes when I'm bored eating cereal in the morning.
[132:06.86]You know what I mean?
[132:08.20]That's the only reading I've done.
[132:10.02]It's just the, what's on the back of the Cocoa Puffs box?
[132:13.24]Oh, it's another maze.
[132:14.68]By the way, let me design those.
[132:16.76]Let me design those fucking things.
[132:19.20]Have you noticed that those have gotten worse?
[132:22.72]Those, the back of the cereal box activity things have gotten worse.
[132:28.58]It's just an easy, shitty maze now.
[132:31.54]There used to be so much cool shit.
[132:33.04]There'd be a word search.
[132:34.48]There'd be a maze over here.
[132:35.98]There'd be find the ten leprechauns.
[132:38.33]What happened?
[132:39.67]There's just... They don't want to do that anymore?
[132:45.83]Oh, here's a Mad Lib.
[132:54.76]Those are for children.
[132:57.96]Yes.
[132:59.08]And I'm saying they're not there anymore.
[133:04.59]No, I'm sorry.
[133:05.87]They're for children, and they're also for adults in a bathrobe at 2 o'clock in the morning eating Honey Nut Cheerios out of a fucking bowl because you're hungry at 2 o'clock in the morning.
[133:15.37]And I'm sorry, who am I going to talk to at 2 a.m.?
[133:18.31]What am I going to do at 2 a.m.? ?
[133:21.43]That is, the box is facing me.
[133:24.11]And it's, I don't know, a little dark outside.
[133:26.47]There's nobody really around.
[133:27.77]It's just, it's me in the box.
[133:30.97]It's just me in the box.
[133:33.29]So, I'm sorry.
[133:35.65]Yes, I read the little activity thing on the back of, if it's like 3am and I'm eating 100 net Cheerios in a bathrobe.
[133:49.34]Oh, here we go.
[133:56.03]Don't act like you don't pick up random shit to read in the bathroom.
[134:01.36]I'm not saying I do that with the Honey Nut Cheerios box.
[134:12.52]But you know what?
[134:13.36]It's the same... It's in the same space.
[134:16.60]It sits in the same spot.
[134:19.29]It's just... It doesn't... It's just shit that doesn't even matter.
[134:23.39]That you're just passing time with in two minutes.
[134:55.83]Dude, you realize the toilet bowl is not for the cereal, right?
[135:00.39]Like I'm putting the cereal into the toilet bowl.
[135:15.13]Captain Crunch still has puzzles on it.
[135:18.65]He did it with coffee recently while I was asleep.
[135:20.61]I'm horrified.
[135:21.55]He talked about it on stream and I learned about it hours later.
[135:23.69]Whoa, he talked about it when I drank the espresso while I was taking a shit.
[135:27.88]That was a little unhinged.
[135:29.54]I will agree.
[135:33.02]I felt like it.
[135:34.66]I don't care.
[135:35.06]I felt like doing it.
[135:36.06]That's it.
[135:42.66]I felt like... I just felt like it.
[135:43.98]That's it.
[135:44.47]That's all.
[135:45.25]I don't need to explain.
[135:45.93]There's no explanation.
[135:47.27]It actually is not an explanation.
[135:48.67]People are like, dude, why?
[135:50.61]Why did you do that?
[135:51.37]There is none.
[135:52.47]There's nothing to explain.
[136:00.44]It's just, I felt like it one day.
[136:02.38]I was like, I'm going to do this today.
[136:07.70]That's it.
[136:10.04]And it was like, whatever.
[136:11.28]I don't...
[136:13.22]It wasn't a big deal.
[136:14.02]It actually wasn't a big deal.
[136:17.73]Okay, let me explain.
[136:18.83]For those of you that don't know or weren't here or whatever.
[136:21.23]I don't know, like three years ago, whatever it was.
[136:25.15]It was like, I don't know, like a few months ago.
[136:26.65]I was late to a stream.
[136:31.26]And I like to have a coffee before the stream.
[136:34.62]And I made an espresso.
[136:36.66]The espresso was just a little, it's just a little thing.
[136:39.90]It's not even two ounces of liquid.
[136:43.92]so that's a lot of money by the way so I make an espresso I'm already like five to ten minutes probably late to the stream so I'm just like okay usually it's you drink the coffee and then okay I need I don't really need to go this far coffee is a um it's a diuretic it I I coffee in the morning gets me moving right
[137:11.89]So I was like, you know what?
[137:13.71]I'm late to the stream already.
[137:16.19]I'm just going to bring this into the bathroom.
[137:18.73]Like, what the fuck do I care?
[137:20.39]It's one and a half ounces of liquid.
[137:22.05]I didn't even care.
[137:24.77]And I sat there and was just sipping on an espresso while I was, you know, getting prepared.
[137:34.09]What?
[137:35.09]Is that really that weird?
[137:40.69]And I remember sitting there going like, alright.
[137:52.73]I've only, that's only, I've done it once.
[137:54.47]I haven't done that ever again.
[137:55.61]How are we doing over here?
[138:02.25]Good.
[138:06.20]It doesn't matter.
[138:06.74]That's kind of a weird vibe.
[138:17.37]I disagree.
[138:22.52]It was something that I just did one time and I was like, you know what?
[138:25.10]Fuck it.
[138:25.38]I'm going to do this once because I feel like it.
[138:29.15]And I will tell you, it was, it was not a negative experience.
[138:32.39]It was not, I don't want to say it was a positive experience, but there was nothing.
[138:35.91]I got through the coffee and I was done and I was ready to go.
[138:38.28]And I skipped like 10 straight minutes of like sipping a coffee before the stream.
[138:45.32]Alright, let me go upgrade something.
[138:52.65]It wasn't only one time.
[138:53.55]It was only one time.
[138:54.81]That's it.
[139:03.53]Oh, I need ore.
[139:07.60]Okay.
[139:10.72]Ten of these.
[139:11.22]I feel like I need this.
[139:16.69]Alright, this is four feet.
[139:17.47]I need ten of the funny plorts.
[139:20.50]Okay.
[139:34.61]Okay, let's do that.
[139:37.43]And I will load this up momentarily.
[139:40.23]How you guys doing?
[139:44.64]You alright?
[139:46.74]I think I need to make this go faster.
[139:50.94]Yeah, people are hungry in there.
[139:54.11]How are you?
[139:54.71]Let's do increase soil.
[139:56.37]Faster growth.
[139:58.59]Looks good.
[140:01.63]Are you at the age where you have a magazine rack in the bathroom yet?
[140:03.92]Um... Nah.
[140:05.96]I think I have to do another... Yeah.
[140:20.15]I need more food.
[140:20.67]I just do.
[140:24.07]This is vegetables.
[140:24.93]I need fruit.
[140:27.97]Or... Yes.
[140:30.99]Okay.
[140:38.04]Did you eat a three-course meal on the crapper?
[140:40.94]I have not heard anybody say crapper in a long time.
[140:42.90]That's impressive.
[140:45.32]Um... Well, no, that's not true, but whatever.
[140:51.99]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[140:54.81]Should I just put vegetable in there?
[140:57.70]No, I'll be back.
[141:07.48]Um... I gotta get off this island.
[141:11.08]I feel like I've seen a lot of the, uh... I feel like I gotta go up here.
[141:16.67]Or this way.
[141:17.39]Because I've gotten pretty much everything off here.
[141:21.85]Are there any other slimes that are here?
[141:23.19]Wait, I need ten of these.
[141:25.67]I need ten florts.
[141:34.42]Ten of the bunny florts.
[141:46.91]I need that.
[141:49.71]Okay.
[141:50.91]I need 10 of these.
[141:54.52]Come on.
[141:56.12]Three.
[141:57.10]Four.
[142:00.38]Somebody else eat something.
[142:03.06]I missed a lucky slime?
[142:04.18]What does that mean?
[142:10.85]Five.
[142:18.97]Come on.
[142:21.39]If you eat the veggies, then eat them.
[142:27.91]Okay, that's it.
[142:40.42]One more.
[142:40.72]Where is it?
[142:48.50]Why don't you just please... Okay.
[142:54.08]Alright, 10.
[142:56.00]Good.
[142:56.48]I can now upgrade the vacuum cleaner.
[142:58.38]I forgot to blink for like an hour.
[143:05.43]Okay.
[143:13.32]Okay.
[143:15.73]I'm going to do another pog fruit tree.
[143:17.84]I think it makes the most sense.
[143:23.42]Oh, shit.
[143:23.88]Look at this.
[143:27.84]Why was this one so fertilized or whatever?
[143:29.58]That's a lot.
[143:32.12]Okay.
[143:48.03]Okay, 19.
[143:51.49]I guess I could feed this, right?
[143:53.45]Isn't there one down there?
[143:54.43]Anything else over here?
[144:01.06]Alright, this is the only area I've not been, so let's just take a quick look.
[144:26.09]Actually, there was.
[144:26.61]It was a hen.
[144:47.01]Okay.
[144:49.33]I think that's good.
[144:50.43]Although I'd like a...
[144:53.61]I think that's good.
[144:54.51]I'll get the upgrade for the vacuum cleaner.
[144:57.98]Ooh, what's that?
[145:00.88]You need to take a cold shower, chat?
[145:11.06]Is there any data?
[145:12.31]Isn't there science behind that?
[145:17.43]Finishing your shower with it not being hot hot hot is actually not a bad thing.
[145:29.39]Can you play Trombone Champ?
[145:31.30]Actually, I'll play Trombone Champ.
[145:32.64]Probably, maybe tomorrow.
[145:37.70]Because I want to do Breath of the Wild tomorrow.
[145:41.96]Is Trombone Champ on the Switch?
[145:44.22]Or is it a Steam game?
[145:49.26]Yeah, I'll do Breath of the Wild and Trombone Champ.
[145:52.86]Is it on Switch?
[145:56.75]Steam, okay.

[146:54.43]Maybe the price will increase tomorrow.
[146:56.61]What about Splatoon?
[146:59.02]I did want to play Splatoon eventually.
[147:09.93]No price change, whatever.
[147:11.19]Alright, sucking these up, right?
[147:28.78]Remind me to keep ten of these, otherwise I will forget.
[147:31.14]Okay, there's ten in the chamber thing here.

[149:14.78]Alright.
[149:16.26]So I can... Now I can get resources from a node?
[149:21.82]Shakes loose science resources from nodes in the environment.
[149:27.64]What does that mean?
[149:35.57]What does that mean?
[149:36.63]A node?
[149:42.60]Will I know a node when I see one?
[149:51.45]Yeah.
[149:51.93]Okay.

[156:03.39]Qberry, ResidentSleeper, Qberry.
[156:08.62]Chat's on something today.
[156:09.70]To be fair, the entire stream feels like we all shared a joint.
[156:22.38]Does it?
[156:32.54]So is this a food?
[156:34.38]This jelly stone?
[156:39.38]What does it do?
[156:41.15]Is it just like a... Is it a buff or something?
[156:48.23]Oh, here we go.
[156:54.61]Don't touch those.
[156:55.31]It's mine.
[157:00.82]Deep brine.
[157:09.42]Not safe for drinking.
[157:11.56]Water from a slime sea that's been filtered by the subterranean core below Rainbow Island.
[157:15.91]It's denser than fresh water and loaded with salt.
[157:21.63]Okay.
[157:23.09]What do I do with it?
[157:31.52]It's bong water.
[157:52.02]Nothing else over here.
[157:54.42]Oh, yeah, there is.
[157:55.32]I remember there was one in a cave somewhere, right?
[157:58.23]Yeah.
[158:02.95]Alright, I got a couple new resources.
[158:04.11]What the hell do I do with this shit?
[158:16.94]How hard is the jetpack to get?
[158:18.02]I don't know.
[158:18.32]Let me go look.
[158:20.16]I'll make some money here.
[158:28.14]Put it in the refinery?
[158:29.02]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[158:29.82]Alright, you are fine.
[158:36.69]But you... Where's my second tree over here?
[158:46.25]I really hate to do this, but... I have to delete this.
[158:53.10]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[158:54.72]This one's not upgraded.
[158:55.92]I'll do it to this one.
[159:04.83]There we go.
[159:24.36]Alright, let's collect some cash.
[159:26.10]Because I've got a lot of florts now.
[159:31.74]Yeah, I'm going to end up with like three grand.
[159:38.30]Oh yeah, you better believe it.
[159:39.16]Look at this.
[159:43.96]I'm gonna have like two grand or at least.
[159:53.32]Look at this.
[160:02.71]Um.
[160:14.04]Geez.
[160:25.03]Alright, time to collect.
[160:31.12]This pen, I need a new group of slimes.
[160:34.98]Alright, refinery.
[160:49.68]Okay, I've got jelly stones in here now.
[160:51.64]So what's the, how do I get the jet pack?
[160:58.64]Jet pack is one, 10 radiant ore, 10 phosphor plorts.
[161:03.82]What's that?
[161:04.18]I can get those.
[161:04.72]Where do you get the radiant ore?
[161:17.70]Check caves.
[161:27.26]Alright, let's do a collection here.
[161:57.22]Okay.
[162:02.72]I wonder if I should upgrade people now.
[162:04.38]Like, I should... People.
[162:05.50]What's with my voice?
[162:06.30]Should I combine the ghosts with the pink or something?
[162:30.87]Experiments?
[162:44.02]Is food in the dispenser?
[163:02.89]I think it's garbage, though.
[163:03.87]Yeah, it is.
[163:11.10]Okay, I got a lot of money.
[163:12.28]Can I do anything else with these?
[163:15.06]I think these are all fully upgraded, right?
[163:16.68]Yep.
[163:18.63]This is fully upgraded.
[163:19.59]This is fully upgraded.
[163:20.79]It does have this... I don't think I need that, though.
[163:26.39]This is fully... Wait, no, it's not.
[163:29.05]Safely and gently moves elder chickens away from the younger generations and stores them in a collector.
[163:33.35]Um, should I just do that?
[163:37.32]I feel like they're all getting old.
[163:50.95]There was only one elder chicken in this whole coop?
[163:55.99]That was 1,300 bucks.
[164:01.88]Okay.
[164:03.44]Well.
[164:15.71]This is good.
[164:16.33]Alright.
[164:19.45]I'm going to... Where do I go?
[164:20.59]Where should I go?
[164:41.25]Southwest.
[164:44.69]Down here.
[164:52.91]Cubes.
[164:57.60]So now we are going to do this.
[164:59.24]Yeah, get rid of this shit.
[165:04.74]I just want double cubes.
[165:23.43]I have to start feeding chickens to somebody because this is getting ridiculous.
[165:43.55]They eat meat, right?
[165:47.01]think so right veggies and meat I'm just scared that I'm gonna find a slime that only eats meat and I'm gonna waste all these is that wrong to think that
[166:21.31]Alright.
[166:21.85]I need a new slime.
[166:25.06]Look at this pen over here.
[166:25.92]It's not being used for anything.
[166:27.42]What are you doing over here?
[166:33.98]Oh, you're just hungry.
[166:35.28]Oh, okay.
[166:35.70]Well, here.
[166:38.65]That's a special cube.
[166:40.35]That's cube fruit.
[166:43.17]That's just for you.
[166:43.87]There.
[166:47.41]There you go.
[166:47.75]Alright.
[166:52.94]Speaking of cube fruit, I should probably store this.
[166:58.18]Or feed it to these guys over here.
[167:01.92]Yeah.
[167:07.91]Alright, I'm going to the southwest.
[167:11.01]Special dork fruit.
[167:15.43]Alright.
[167:21.77]Let's move.
[167:27.05]There's too many tabby slimes.
[167:31.53]I cracked the super mysterious code that was sent to me.
[167:34.42]It was complex.
[167:35.16]I believe that AI... I believe that the AI that created this code displays a comparable intellect to my own.
[167:41.38]So very advanced.
[167:42.40]Almost alien.
[167:44.38]What did it say?
[167:45.00]Okay.
[167:45.80]Hello.
[167:47.69]Hello.
[168:01.58]Who's this?
[168:05.46]Hold up, Beatrix.
[168:06.23]Are you there?
[168:06.81]It's me, Ogden Ortiz.
[168:08.55]I hear you're off on a big new adventure on a mysterious island filled with secrets and danger and maybe a few succulent fruits and veggies the world has never seen before.
[168:16.51]You know, I had to ask.
[168:17.84]Ever since you got me a steady supply of Cucadoba fruits, I've been reaching for even greater culinary heights.
[168:25.95]Getting pretty tired of eating, uh, Cucadoba pie.
[168:30.15]Cucadoba souffle.
[168:31.38]Cucadoba pudding.
[168:33.38]Cucadoba corn.
[168:34.84]Carne.
[168:35.64]Cucadoba con... You get the idea.
[168:39.22]I'm running out of ideas and willpower.
[168:41.64]If you see something new, please tell me about it.
[168:43.53]Okay.
[168:50.55]Okay.
[168:52.77]Oh, I got this.
[168:53.55]Finally.
[168:58.31]How do I turn that on?
[169:07.02]How do I use the water?
[169:07.76]Do I have to suck water up first?
[169:17.26]Is that other tree upgraded all the way?
[169:23.10]No, it's not.
[169:28.25]This is democracy manifest.
[169:32.96]Oh, that's a nice chokehold, sir.
[169:34.06]It's one of my favorite videos of all time.
[169:42.22]I mean, it's a classic video.

[179:17.96]Can you do the ooh, oh, ooh voice?
[179:20.14]I've been waiting a long time.
[179:21.64]No, I promised I would never do it again.
[179:28.12]If there's a reason to do it, maybe I would.
[179:33.27]Um, I kind of don't know where to go.
[179:34.69]I could feed the big guy.
[179:37.35]I could try to go this way.
[179:38.55]Let me look at what's over here.
[179:40.23]I feel like that's where I need to go.
[179:42.21]Wait, there's a voice desync?
[179:51.82]No, there shouldn't be.
[179:53.76]No, there really shouldn't be.
[179:57.87]I turned all that off.
[180:02.49]The webcam is late.
[180:04.83]Huh?
[180:11.07]It really shouldn't be.
[180:15.39]It's probably because of the low FPS on this piece of shit.
[180:21.19]Yeah, this thing's a piece of crap.
[180:23.29]Actually, this thing's a piece of crap.
[180:28.83]But I'm one of those people that complains about a product.
[180:32.04]And never stops using the product.
[180:35.44]I just complain about it every day.
[180:43.00]Have I gone up there?
[180:43.68]I haven't... I need the jetpack.
[180:57.88]Seems fine now.
[180:58.68]That's weird.
[180:59.04]Alright, I'm gonna head over here because I feel like this is where I need to go.
[181:07.18]I need to activate the boat or something.
[181:20.99]Because if I go this way, how much is this?
[181:27.97]Alright, 1800 bucks.
[181:29.85]Alright, let's go.
[181:30.35]I can make that right now.
[181:36.24]I guarantee you I can make that right now.
[181:42.90]I... Okay, I need to get rid of at least a third of these chickens.
[182:13.29]I see you know your judo well.
[182:20.86]Where's my cabbage farm?
[182:28.10]Like, the cabbages aren't even ready?
[182:31.03]How is that possible?
[182:31.83]Alright.
[182:36.51]Here we go.
[182:36.95]How is it possible that there's no cabbage right now?
[183:13.07]oh man okay yeah I definitely can afford it now what the fuck is that
[183:39.86]AI prompt photo for a Jerma enjoying a succulent Chinese meal.
[183:45.56]What?
[183:55.27]At a Jerma985 enjoying a succulent Chinese meal in an upscale restaurant.
[184:00.93]Oh, I see.
[184:02.01]They fed the face and they didn't generate the face.
[184:05.57]I was gonna say, this is weird.
[184:10.20]Hold on.
[184:14.30]This is weird.
[184:15.42]Yeah, I'll show you.
[184:29.09]This is creepy.
[184:33.69]I thought it made my face.
[184:35.27]Ahem.
[184:49.38]What's happening to my hair?
[184:51.42]Why am I putting it into my ears?
[184:55.46]Why am I going into my ears?
[185:02.04]These look like Tinder profile pictures.
[185:15.19]It really does.
[185:22.09]Oh, I'm on vacation.
[185:23.41]What the fuck?
[185:24.07]Why do I look so weird?
[185:25.69]Why do I look so strange?
[185:32.25]What is this from?
[185:34.07]This image right here.
[185:41.99]This is a toothbrush.
[185:48.91]Oh, whatever.
[186:05.77]AI is fucked, man.
[186:07.08]It really is.
[186:20.92]The prompt for this apparently was, what the fuck is this?
[186:30.49]Jerma985 enjoying succulent Chinese mayonnaise at home in his kitchen.
[186:34.27]Why do I have sunglasses on my head?
[186:39.23]What is this one?
[186:44.34]What is going on in this image?
[186:52.04]Can somebody help me with this?
[186:57.73]They said Reddit shelf.
[186:59.15]Me with my Reddit shelf.
[187:02.92]It's so funny because... Why am I so skinny?
[187:18.10]It can't do text.
[187:19.52]It's just you and the Reddit shelf.
[187:20.90]But what's even on here?
[187:21.84]Why is there a sink?
[187:26.26]There is a sink on the Reddit shelf.
[187:34.30]Look at this.
[187:37.24]Right here.
[187:37.56]Right in the middle.
[187:39.94]What else is even on here?
[187:43.81]A toilet- An empty toilet paper roll.
[187:45.79]A bunch of Funko Pops.
[187:48.39]Weird Funko Pops.
[187:49.69]Are these like backpacks?
[187:52.93]A bathroom sink.
[187:53.88]A toilet- A toilet-
[188:04.19]Um, what else is it in this room?
[188:06.79]What is this?
[188:07.31]What's this shirt?
[188:08.19]I think that's a Wii behind me.
[188:14.24]R-I-R?
[188:20.40]Rims... J.C.
[188:25.00]Mister?
[188:26.04]J.C.
[188:27.50]What is...
[188:31.48]Dude, AI is so fucking weird.
[188:34.78]This shit is, this shit is fucked up.
[188:37.29]It really is.
[188:40.73]What's on the ground?
[188:49.41]Unbelievable.
[188:56.20]Jesus.
[188:57.60]Okay.
[189:06.68]Alright, there's tons of money now.
[189:08.74]And I'm gonna go open up that other door.
[189:16.02]I... Okay, the chickens are... This is better.
[189:24.15]Okay.
[189:24.83]So this is good.
[189:25.43]That looks good.
[189:31.12]That looks good.
[189:34.78]46.
[189:35.32]I need to hold more plorts.
[189:42.63]How do I upgrade my plort holding ability?
[189:59.08]These are going down in price.
[190:08.55]Two grand, probably.
[190:09.43]I should be able to open it.
[190:10.43]Okay.
[190:25.69]Would you ever play Super Monkey Ball?
[190:27.09]Um, I did.
[190:28.81]I beat it already.
[190:32.09]Correct me if I'm wrong, but that was a Meltdown stream, right?
[190:34.22]I had a lot of problems with that game.
[190:43.20]Oh, yeah.
[190:43.64]No, that was kind of a nightmare.
[190:47.70]Do not expect that game to be as hard as it was.
[190:49.08]That game was hard.
[190:52.38]Like, really hard.
[191:12.15]Oh!
[191:12.79]Lettuce!
[191:18.08]Jerma985's gamer room.
[191:19.66]Then I added details like Funko Pops.
[191:23.54]That's crazy.
[191:24.00]Okay.
[191:37.81]This takes forever.
[191:43.46]They're being fed, right?
[191:44.50]Yep.
[191:48.32]Don't ignore it.
[191:57.45]Where's Lala?
[191:58.69]Where's Lala?
[192:04.11]You know, I would do it, but I think a lot of people ask for it a little too much.
[192:10.17]We had somebody come in here and ask for the ooh-ah-ah thing.
[192:13.26]I don't know.
[192:14.96]People have been asking a little too much for it.
[192:16.50]I don't know.
[192:25.78]I mean, people have been asking for it.
[192:55.39]I'm not doing that again for at least three months.
[193:02.96]That is only three month cooldown.
[193:23.30]I told you three grand.
[193:24.94]That's exactly what we're doing.
[193:27.45]Three grand.
[193:31.45]Three thousand dollars.
[193:39.79]It's going to be pretty close.
[193:48.83]Almost exact.
[193:51.20]Alright.
[193:53.00]Now.
[193:54.86]I want to buy the new area.
[193:57.78]But I also want to see what I can do here.
[194:04.14]Utilities.
[194:07.74]Portable water tap.
[194:11.78]Warp tech.
[194:12.54]Okay.
[194:14.85]Right.
[194:16.51]Decorations.
[194:17.85]Upgrades.
[194:20.15]Water tank.
[194:21.57]Extra tank.
[194:22.43]Tank booster.
[194:25.61]There we go.
[194:26.25]Alright.
[194:26.51]It's 10 tabby plorts and 450.
[194:28.49]So let me get the tabby plorts.
[194:32.92]10 tabby plorts.
[194:40.34]And let's open this up.
[194:43.22]New area.
[194:50.31]What the hell is that sound?
[195:06.76]Ooh.
[195:09.08]Oh, this is another... Ooh.
[195:10.14]Ooh.
[195:13.95]Okay.
[195:21.53]Okay.
[195:25.42]Sorry, I coughed, like, in your face.
[195:30.60]So this is just extra space.
[195:31.78]Alright.
[195:39.48]Is there anything else I can do here?
[195:52.23]Whatever's down here.
[195:52.97]What's this?
[195:58.41]The tide pools.
[196:00.76]Okay.
[196:05.56]So this is all just expansion on the conservatory.
[196:11.38]How do I get out of here?
[196:13.68]Like, out of the island.
[196:14.44]Because, I mean, look, there's definitely at least another area or two to explore, right?
[196:19.59]How do I get out of here?
[196:25.27]They have to feed the giant slimes?
[196:27.15]Okay.
[196:31.18]Where am I now?
[196:31.68]Alright, go this way.
[196:39.24]Which are the big slimes should I feed?
[196:41.88]The vegetable one or the fruit one?
[196:51.37]The veggie one?
[196:52.51]Does the veggie one also eat meat?
[197:00.72]Which one of them eats meat?
[197:01.64]Because I'm going to bring like a hundred chickens.
[197:04.86]No.
[197:06.02]Damn it.
[197:06.36]I don't think I even have enough vegetables.
[197:11.10]The pink one will eat the meat.
[197:17.65]Because there's this one here and this one here.
[197:18.81]One of them's fruits, one's vegetables.
[197:20.81]Pink is any.
[197:23.89]Alright.
[197:24.53]So we're going to feed the big slimes.
[197:26.09]That's the next part of the plot.
[197:41.30]I feel like these have taken so long.
[198:08.05]That's the deal.
[198:13.63]Okay.
[198:15.96]450.
[198:15.98]I can carry 30 of each thing.
[198:18.16]Okay, cool.
[198:22.60]Jetpack.
[198:23.10]I don't have it yet.
[198:24.56]Dash boots.
[198:25.77]Power core.
[198:29.55]Don't really need these right now, but I definitely wanted that.
[198:31.21]Alright, let's go.
[198:39.14]why don't you say penis on stream I just did and I have what are you talking about hmm alright we gotta go feed people I need vegetables
[199:03.41]I'm just going on a vegetable hunt.
[199:05.44]That's it.
[199:06.06]Just picking up a hundred of each one.
[199:11.30]What's my take on kefir?
[199:12.22]I love kefir.
[199:12.72]There's kefir in my fridge right now.
[199:15.50]It's amazing.
[199:18.97]It is amazing.
[199:20.67]Highly recommend it.
[199:32.73]You grow your own... I don't know.
[199:35.93]Grow my own kefir?
[199:37.21]That's a very... That's a huge process that I want nothing to do with.
[199:43.13]I just want to buy it and drink it.
[199:57.74]It's not that hard.
[200:01.13]Yeah, is it... Hold on.
[200:02.53]Is it like making your own kombucha, whatever it is?
[200:06.91]Where you have to get, like, that weird circle alien bacteria thing and stick it in the... I don't know.
[200:12.35]I don't like it.
[200:14.39]It's not that hard?
[200:19.95]Scoby, yep.
[200:22.95]It's this weird hockey puck of bacteria that sits on top of the kombucha.
[200:30.39]Mm-mm.
[200:36.83]It's wicked easy, dude.
[200:37.39]Just leave milk out in the sun.
[200:39.69]Oh, yeah.
[200:40.17]That's how you do it.
[200:41.99]Thanks for the help.
[200:42.75]Thanks for the tip on how to make kefir.
[200:45.63]Just leave milk out in the sun.
[200:47.95]Cool.
[200:48.61]I guess that's how you do it.
[200:49.37]That's not how you do it.
[200:58.44]Is it really that difficult to make, though?
[200:59.80]For real?
[201:10.06]it kind of is starts with kefir crystals okay my parents do it it's not hard I don't it probably doesn't it's probably not hard but probably takes a while doesn't it how long does it like the fermentation process take at least a couple weeks or something right or at least a week
[201:33.26]No, I don't fuck with anything like that.
[201:34.94]I don't fuck with fermentation.
[201:36.10]I don't fuck with making anything like that ever.
[201:38.90]Because what you are doing, you are making a fermented product.
[201:44.20]You are taking milk, which, I mean, I don't know, man.
[201:49.73]Like, I don't want to make kefir.
[201:52.31]Oh, I made my own kefir.
[201:53.45]I made my own kombucha.
[201:55.65]And take one sip and insta-puke.
[201:58.51]And go to the hospital.
[202:00.91]I don't feel like doing that.
[202:04.15]Why do that when I can just buy it?
[202:09.01]Oh, it turns out you made it wrong, and there's a bunch of other bacteria in this, and you just drank... You just drank... Now you gotta go to the hospital.
[202:14.51]Because you just puked.
[202:16.15]And, like, you insta-puked.
[202:18.20]Wine is fermented.
[202:18.94]Yeah, I'm not waking my own wine in the closet over here.
[202:33.36]People have the FDA and shit, right?
[202:36.40]I don't know.
[202:38.58]When you buy kombucha at the store, or when you buy kefir from the supermarket or whatever, I don't think it's coming from some random dude's closet.
[202:49.08]Isn't there regulation on the milk?
[202:57.88]I don't know.
[202:58.26]I...
[203:07.38]fda yeah okay I don't know well I don't know it's not it's not like some guy like on the I don't know it's not like the back of the carton's like hey my name is Dave I made this uh my name is Dave I made this with my bare feet like okay I don't that doesn't no it's made in a processing facility where cleanliness and
[203:33.95]You know, there's a process involved, there's trained employees and people that know what they're doing.
[203:41.02]I don't know, maybe Dave's bare feet kombuchas.
[203:44.90]I don't know.
[203:46.02]I'm afraid of products that are fermented.
[203:55.03]Dude, FDA is federally Dave approved.
[204:04.56]You are full of shit.
[204:05.40]You would not buy... You would not... I'm looking at you right now.
[204:09.42]I moved you.
[204:09.98]I put you over here.
[204:10.61]I moved you from over here to over here.
[204:12.47]I'm reading you right now.
[204:15.23]You would not buy a product if it was called Dave's Bare Feet Kombucha.
[204:18.03]You wouldn't buy it.
[204:20.45]You wouldn't buy it.
[204:22.01]I know you wouldn't.
[204:28.94]I'd probably try it, dude.
[204:38.81]You don't know me, man.
[204:46.35]I guess not.
[204:55.95]What about the show called Barefoot Contesta?
[205:00.85]The show, okay, the show Barefoot Contesta is not called Barefoot Contesta's Bare Feet Kombucha.
[205:08.45]That's not the same.
[205:12.25]The product is called Dave's Bare Feet Kombucha.
[205:17.93]That's a huge difference.
[205:21.10]There's a huge difference.
[205:30.68]What about wine?
[205:31.52]Alright, I'm moving on!
[205:47.40]Drinking wine.
[205:48.64]What about wine?
[205:50.34]No, it's not!
[205:51.60]That doesn't happen!
[205:52.56]Alright, I have a lot of vegetables that I need to prepare.
[206:01.05]They do that.
[206:02.96]What about the wine stuff?
[206:04.40]You stomp grapes dude.
[206:17.39]Yes.
[206:19.29]Some small batch wine person place will do that, maybe.
[206:27.12]But when you buy the... Oh, there's a wine called... Isn't there a wine called, like, Barefeet?
[206:34.70]The most popular wine in the world is, like, Barefeet wine or something, isn't it?
[206:45.78]I... Listen.
[206:47.62]I'm trying to say that... But they don't... I was trying to say the big, like, corporate wine companies aren't like bare feet wines, but there it is.
[206:58.77]I'll take the L. Barefoot wine.
[207:01.61]I lose.
[207:02.77]I lose.
[207:03.95]Sometimes you lose.
[207:04.67]I'm going to lose.
[207:06.63]I take a loss.
[207:07.41]I'll lose this one.
[207:09.25]I'll lose it.
[207:10.69]Yep.
[207:11.05]I lose.
[207:11.33]That's a loss.
[207:16.59]I hate, I don't like losing.
[207:18.55]I lose.
[207:18.87]I don't want, I hate losing.
[207:25.21]Alright, fine, I lose.
[207:26.23]Fine, I lose.
[207:29.03]Oh, I fucking hate losing.
[207:32.28]Okay.
[207:36.12]No, stop feeding it to, alright, I gotta deposit this crap.
[207:42.35]Yes, hold on, I'm getting backed up by a mob though.
[207:47.12]It's called Barefoot Wine, not Dave's Barefeet Wine.
[207:54.18]There is a semantic difference here.
[208:01.89]Yes, there's a difference.
[208:03.45]Dave's Barefeet Wine versus Barefoot Wine.
[208:10.97]One is implying that Dave's bare feet were in this drink.
[208:14.94]And the other one is like, oh, barefoot.
[208:17.72]Maybe we're on the beach.
[208:19.86]Maybe we're, I don't know, relaxing at home.
[208:23.66]I don't know.
[208:24.00]You know what I'm saying?
[208:26.00]There's a different context.
[208:30.64]Dude, you're weird.
[208:31.95]Alright.
[208:37.05]Okay.
[208:44.87]Okay.
[208:49.82]Alright, let's go feed the big guy.
[208:58.41]Wait, hold on, I gotta answer this.
[209:01.44]Somebody said really important.
[209:02.70]Oh, fuck.
[209:04.97]I missed it.
[209:05.41]Somebody said, this is really important for context.
[209:08.01]Jerma, this will make or break the argument.
[209:09.71]Okay.
[209:10.75]Does the packaging look homemade?
[209:12.43]And does Dave have his picture on the box?
[209:20.42]Um.
[209:29.17]Come on.
[209:29.77]You have to give me some credit.
[209:30.67]Yes.
[209:40.32]I love this car.
[209:41.02]It's so stupid.
[209:50.00]I'm not buying it.
[209:50.68]That's worse.
[209:51.48]No, but it's not that it's worse.
[209:53.26]It's... Okay.
[209:55.51]Let me make some money.
[209:58.51]But is it just his face?
[209:59.53]Okay.
[210:02.09]Is it Dave going like this?
[210:05.10]Does Dave have a big beard?
[210:06.02]Okay, does Dave have a huge beard?
[210:13.54]I feel like it would be Dave going like, and he's got a huge beard.
[210:19.29]Then like, okay, that's just Dave.
[210:20.75]And like, maybe that means like Dave is, I don't know, likes to be barefoot and whatever on the beach or whatever.
[210:32.90]It's just as it's his it's his bare feet then no then absolutely not I don't want it You guys are distracting the fuck out of me right now Marketing
[210:56.40]Guys, no one would do this with their marketing.
[210:58.32]No one would be like, hey, I have an idea.
[211:00.56]I'm going to make a wine, and it's going to be called Dave's Bare Feet Wine.
[211:03.52]And oh, by the way, let me remind people that it's my bare feet that is crushing the grapes, and I'm going to put my feet on the picture on the packaging.
[211:11.67]Marketing 101 would be like, I don't think we do that.
[211:29.93]Somebody typed this.
[211:30.71]I need to find out if it's for real.
[211:33.11]Barefoot's creator.
[211:35.77]His first wine he made in his garage.
[211:37.51]It was called Barefoot Burgundy.

[212:53.11]Has that happened before?
[212:55.41]Have I ever been this eviscerated on camera?
[212:58.99]I don't think so.
[213:00.41]This is an absolute, complete, and total incorrect statement I've been making this whole time.
[213:05.47]Wow.
[213:14.20]We told you.

[214:37.56]Would you drink it?
[214:38.06]It's just like, I farted in the room where this was made.
[214:41.46]It's probably time to cease, Jerma.
[214:48.89]This is reaching now.
[214:49.61]Wow, you're reaching hard.
[214:51.79]Alright, the mods are telling me to stop.
[214:56.07]Is this reaching?
[214:56.53]Yeah, this is reaching pretty hard, I think.

[215:46.36]Where's the big slime?
[215:54.90]It's in a cave?
[215:56.09]Oh, it's down here.
[215:59.23]Okay, this is fruits.
[216:14.91]Ooh, okay.
[216:17.81]So now we're under here.

[217:11.47]No.

[220:39.11]Okay.
[221:15.66]What are these things you're pulling out here?

[221:21.91]Noire, the Jerma craft killer... Alright, Detective Andy.
[221:26.53]He holds up a bottle of barefoot wine to the camera.
[221:28.95]Okay.
[221:46.49]I can't drink it.
[221:50.49]Why can't I drink it?
[221:57.83]It's literally the thumbnail.
[222:32.71]Whatever.
[222:36.73]Whatever.
[222:39.65]There's a lot of money to be made here.
[222:41.45]I gotta feed a lot of people.
[222:42.61]Hold on.
[222:57.05]Dave's bread?
[222:59.23]Dave's bread is great.
[223:05.87]Okay.
[223:34.34]It's time to do a huge turn in here very soon.
[223:44.42]This is going to be a lot of money.
[223:45.42]This is going to be more money than I know what to do with.
[223:56.91]Look at this.
[224:13.44]How many of these do I need?
[224:14.88]That door.
[224:16.02]Just one?
[224:23.99]Just one?
[224:24.33]Cool.
[224:43.81]Oh no, you're hungry.
[224:44.67]Hold on, I'll feed him.
[225:23.33]Any more?
[225:23.99]I think we're good.
[225:26.01]Maybe we'll be at five grand?
[225:33.39]It's overflowing.
[225:47.88]Make sure to save a tabby plort.
[225:49.58]Yep.
[225:51.02]Alright, 4200 bucks.
[225:52.26]What can I do?
[225:52.86]Alright, pink plorts is more health.
[226:17.40]I still need the ore.
[226:18.20]I don't have any.
[226:18.74]Okay, I have enough jelly stones.
[226:25.19]Um, I don't think I can do anything.
[226:34.29]Okay.
[226:36.06]Very cool.
[226:36.78]It's time.
[226:37.40]Dude, I'll just bank the money.
[226:39.06]I don't need it.
[226:43.18]What, tomatoes?
[226:45.50]Do I really need to give my tomato opinion again?
[226:48.74]I feel like I've been pretty clear about it.
[226:52.44]Alright, I need a tabby port.
[227:04.77]Alright.
[227:17.73]Is this thing fully upgraded?
[227:18.67]I'm just gonna buy it.
[227:29.19]Is everything fully upgraded?
[227:30.17]Yep.
[227:39.04]Uh, this pen over here could use it.
[227:40.66]I need another slime.
[227:52.69]Alright, this thing's ready.
[228:01.44]Do you prefer a fast food place to wrap your burger in paper or foil?
[228:05.18]Paper.
[228:08.45]Something about foil, I feel like I'm going to accidentally eat a piece.
[228:11.25]And it's like I just ate metal.
[228:13.01]MonkaS.
[228:14.67]If I eat some paper, I don't care.
[228:35.56]Foil will keep it warm.
[228:40.08]Foil makes it feel premium.
[228:44.98]Yeah, I didn't think about that.
[228:46.44]That's kind of true.
[228:47.54]That makes sense.
[228:53.82]Keeps it warm.
[228:54.44]Alright, time to go open that thing.
[229:10.71]Burger or burrito?
[229:13.41]Okay, let me backtrack a little.
[229:17.81]Burger or taco?
[229:19.69]That's harder.
[229:21.17]Burger or burrito?
[229:22.21]It's burger every time.
[229:24.95]I don't dislike burritos.
[229:26.43]I just... Burgers are better in my brain.
[229:29.24]But burger versus taco.
[229:31.82]That's actually very hard for me.
[229:34.02]Because I don't think I could answer that.
[229:35.20]I really don't.
[229:35.70]Alright, so it's down here.
[229:45.67]Burritos have a tendency to get really messy.
[229:59.31]What about tacos?
[230:00.01]Alright, but okay.
[230:05.37]How do I word this?
[230:05.99]A taco is usually...
[230:10.80]small, very small.
[230:13.44]And I can, I get through a taco and I'm like, alright, cool.
[230:17.42]Then I got two more tacos.
[230:19.34]Sure.
[230:20.46]I, yeah, I'll take another taco.
[230:22.04]That sounds great.
[230:24.10]But a burrito, burrito, unfortunately is huge.
[230:31.22]They're usually big and stuffed full of stuff.
[230:34.89]So you get, sometimes you might get halfway through burrito and it's just like, I don't really want the rest of this.
[230:41.58]Tacos, you can kind of portion out what you want, where a burrito, a big burrito especially, you're committed here.
[230:49.68]You could wrap it back up and put it in the fridge, but I don't know.
[230:53.95]I'd rather just eat what I want.
[231:02.03]And plus, a street taco is sort of, I mean, if you have the soft shell, kind of soft street taco, it kind of is a burrito.
[231:10.20]It's just a small one.
[231:13.41]I don't like the big bur- and things- I don't- I like one thing.
[231:15.77]Tacos to me, I like, because you got the layers.
[231:18.52]It's meat, cheese, and then on top of the cheese is lettuce, then on top of the lettuce is tomatoes, whatever, right?
[231:24.86]It's a layered experience, and everything doesn't kind of mush together.
[231:27.16]A burrito, everything gets mushed into this soup in the middle, and I'm talking.
[231:37.44]Um, and everything turns into kind of this weird meat soup.
[231:40.98]Where it's just kind of, everything mushes together.
[231:43.16]I like it being kind of separated in the taco.
[231:49.49]Now, let me make, I gotta make this really 100% clear.
[231:52.39]If you gave me a burrito right now, and you said, Hey, eat this.
[231:59.99]It's a burrito.
[232:02.25]I'd go, uh, yes, that sounds fucking incredible.
[232:07.38]It's not like an S tier versus D tier.
[232:10.12]It's like an A plus tier versus A minus tier.
[232:14.12]If that makes any sense.
[232:14.88]So there you go.
[232:16.56]That's my take on burritos versus tacos.
[232:23.15]Alright, where was that?
[232:24.55]Down here, right?
[232:27.83]Where's the cave?
[232:28.47]I forgot where that cave was.
[232:37.46]I feel like it's right here somewhere, right?
[232:46.66]Where is it?
[232:47.00]Can you guys help?
[232:54.38]It's over near the beach.
[232:56.35]Can you help?
[232:58.43]Thank you.
[232:59.97]I appreciate the help.
[233:02.47]What about, uh, what's your favorite Indian dish?
[233:04.99]I, I mean, butter chicken is just, I, you, you cannot, I can't, it's, it's just S tier.
[233:10.57]It's 10, 110 out of 10.
[233:11.31]How do I get out?
[233:16.27]How do I get, okay, I gotta stop, I gotta talk about, no more food.
[233:18.83]I need to find this cave.
[233:28.90]Shh, fuck.
[233:30.10]Wait, where was it?
[233:38.12]Like down here?
[233:38.76]No, wasn't it like here?
[233:45.70]I wish I could mark stuff.
[233:50.55]Wasn't it up?
[233:55.17]Somebody help me.
[233:55.65]I genuinely don't know.
[233:59.33]It was like a cave thing here somewhere.
[234:10.58]This is it?
[234:13.02]No.
[234:30.93]Down off the cliff?
[234:40.65]Yeah, wasn't it over here somewhere?
[234:49.96]It's the line on the map.
[234:51.68]No, no, no, no, I'm not looking for that.
[234:53.30]I'm looking for the place where I can shoot this plort.
[234:57.93]It was like up and then down and then... I just honestly have no idea.
[235:02.91]I do not remember where it was.
[235:17.05]it's near the conservatory is it isn't it just like right here yeah alright here it is yeah I was like no there's no way there we go
[235:43.74]Tank guard?
[235:47.26]What is that?
[235:47.72]Pretty cool.
[235:52.80]Alright, now let's go to the next area down here.
[236:03.88]37-year-old Jerma is whack.
[236:16.14]Yeah, I turned 37, guys, and now every stream is a crack stream.
[236:24.74]Have I ever had octopus?
[236:26.04]I haven't.
[236:27.00]I don't like it.
[236:28.58]It creeps me out.
[236:40.93]Yeah, it's a little weird for me.
[236:47.74]right so from here can I go wait hold on even squid too squid kind of freaks me out too something about it I really don't want to ruin the calamari for anybody but
[237:14.28]It looks very specifically like something that I don't like.
[237:19.64]Here we go.
[237:33.39]Let's move.
[237:37.02]Although I do have a bunch of shit.
[237:38.12]Maybe I should get rid of this.
[237:43.30]um they look like spiders like lying on their backs with their legs in the air dead when you get like calamari where it's like you know what I'm saying they look they had the legs they like this
[238:15.17]What kind of 37-year-old is afraid of calamari?
[238:18.79]I don't sit in the restaurant and freak out when the calamari comes.
[238:21.88]If somebody orders calamari, I go, oh, alright, cool.
[238:24.60]I'm not going to have any, but I hope you like it.
[238:28.00]It's not like the guy doesn't walk over with the fajita plate.
[238:31.38]Like, shh.
[238:32.70]And I'm just like... No, no, I have to leave.
[238:37.65]I'm fine.
[238:39.03]I don't care.
[238:39.45]I might even eat one.
[238:47.26]New zone, let's go.
[238:48.40]I need a new slime.
[239:09.90]Bingo.
[239:10.12]Alright, I found what I'm going to put in.
[239:19.84]What's making that sound?
[239:26.04]What, did I miss it?
[239:26.98]I missed it.
[239:36.33]I didn't... I didn't even know what I was supposed to be looking for.
[239:39.63]It looked like just a regular li- It looked like a cat slime.
[239:49.93]Beets?
[239:50.21]Alright.
[239:57.83]It's just white.
[239:58.59]Okay.
[240:11.66]What do rocks eat?
[240:13.54]Veggies?
[240:14.04]Really?
[240:14.52]You don't eat meat?
[240:19.51]Interesting What just happened?
[240:47.49]That scared the shit out of me, man!
[241:27.78]No!
[241:28.36]Please make it!
[241:30.60]Oh my fucking god, what?
[241:33.15]What happened?
[241:33.85]What?
[241:41.09]Have it back.
[241:41.39]I'm gonna pee.
[241:44.25]What the fuck?
[241:45.85]You die instantly and you lose everything when you... Whatever.
[241:50.92]I was trying to bring it back.
[241:56.40]Beerby.
[243:25.84]Fucking games.
[243:26.56]Not even fun.
[243:28.82]I got a lot of cleanup to do, though.
[243:30.48]I was muted, but I haven't cleaned my room in a while.
[243:36.51]And I need to clean my room.
[243:38.23]So I gotta clean my room.
[243:41.15]So I'll be right back again.
[244:28.44]Why would I leave the mic on and just start smashing windows?
[244:34.69]Alright, I'm... Alright, I'll actually be right back.
[244:40.11]Remodeling his house.
[244:52.38]Oh, man.
[244:54.42]I was muted.
[244:54.98]I was dying over here.
[244:55.74]I...
[245:00.01]Because people are like, what is he doing?
[245:03.07]If you look up smash controller sound effect, it's one of the first two.
[245:11.48]And whoever's doing this is really hitting it on something.
[245:15.63]And it won't break.
[245:17.07]It's not breaking.
[245:17.99]Alright, BRB for real.
[249:44.34]okay hello again okay I think it's time to dial the uh
[249:54.86]Maybe a little bit of erratic stream behavior here.
[249:57.36]I think we're going to pull it back a little.
[249:58.76]I'm going to chill and relax for the next part of the stream.
[250:08.52]Okay.
[250:12.83]Hey dude, can you reduce the bitrate of the stream so I can finish downloading Devil May Cry 5?
[250:16.35]Uh.
[250:22.15]Just put it in 180p or something.
[250:24.41]You can do that.
[250:28.17]You can do that on your own.
[250:30.28]Put it in like 240p.
[250:37.82]Alright.
[250:38.18]So what was I doing?
[250:39.02]Right.
[250:39.24]Oh, I died.
[250:39.72]That's right.
[250:43.54]It's also funny that I'm not even using a controller.
[250:48.38]Okay, is there a way I can- I gotta teleport.
[250:50.72]I have a teleporter, don't I?
[250:55.34]Do I have to buy it or unlock it?
[250:57.83]Because I have access to this teleporting pod, but do I have to actually make it?
[251:22.61]Ooh, okay.
[251:23.21]I need ten... Perfect.
[251:25.85]I need ten bunny florts and I'm good to go.
[251:30.27]Do I have any in here?
[251:32.65]No.
[251:32.93]Alright, I can do it.
[251:35.38]When do you play Trombone Champ?
[251:37.50]I don't know.
[251:37.94]Maybe... Whenever I stream next?
[251:40.54]Tomorrow?
[251:40.90]The next day?
[251:50.72]I need...
[251:53.09]Just regular bunny plorts.
[252:05.32]Alright, more than 30.
[252:17.65]Damn, okay.
[252:20.65]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[252:31.69]I'm coming.
[252:35.15]I'm coming.
[252:49.51]I'm coming.

[252:51.37]You're not old.
[252:53.70]Thank you.
[252:54.02]That's a nice thing to say.
[252:56.36]Appreciate it.
[253:06.29]Alright, so we got to get this one loaded.
[253:08.37]Because eventually there's going to be somebody in here.
[253:15.99]Okay.
[253:19.77]First things first.
[253:20.43]I'm going to do a one pole here.
[253:22.99]There's a lot of plorts I need to collect.
[253:30.79]Very important.
[253:34.15]Okay.
[253:34.93]Okay.
[253:56.93]Okay.
[254:02.70]Alright.
[254:04.88]Now... I need 10 of the cotton florts.
[254:25.35]Let's build it.
[254:26.55]So now I can actually teleport.
[254:27.65]And I'm not going to get stuck somewhere and not be able to go anywhere.
[254:32.58]Alright, let's do it.
[254:33.32]Build it.
[254:36.48]Home portal.
[254:39.78]One?
[254:40.40]Oh.
[254:52.10]One way travel back to the conservatory.
[254:54.14]It's T.
[254:59.50]Do I need to build it here?
[255:06.47]This gadget is installed permanently until demolished.
[255:08.97]Should I put it somewhere else?
[255:11.49]Oh, okay.
[255:12.35]Let me put it... Where should I put it?
[255:15.47]Can I put it pretty much anywhere?
[255:18.89]I can.
[255:19.29]Alright, I definitely want it next to the house.
[255:21.53]Yeah, without a doubt.
[255:27.16]Right next to the house.
[255:30.80]Very cool.
[255:31.44]Okay.
[255:34.98]So this brings me... What just happened?
[255:44.31]What the hell just happened?
[255:51.90]Don't I... How do I... It's a one-way home portal.
[256:02.06]Uh, but... How do I use it to go back?
[256:16.53]I wasted it?
[256:23.23]It's one way.
[256:24.25]Yeah, but it's not like a town portal in Diablo where like, oh, I'm gonna leave and I go back to that?
[256:31.52]I have to build?
[256:32.20]Okay, alright, alright.
[256:33.10]Let me make sure I get this right.
[256:36.08]So I want to go here.
[256:36.80]Let's go.
[256:43.66]One way to your home.
[256:53.32]Fuck!
[256:54.64]I thought it meant, like, I could... I thought it was a permanent thing that just stayed there.
[256:59.99]It's... What?
[257:06.77]Can I take it back?
[257:09.69]You build it in the wilderness for a quick trip home.
[257:13.36]Yeah, but I thought it was a permanent fixture here and I had like a town portal scroll that I clicked on or something.
[257:22.54]So what the fuck is the point of that?
[257:40.33]I just wasted all those resources too, didn't I?
[257:46.59]How do I remove it?
[257:47.31]Do I get it back?
[257:55.23]I don't get it back.
[257:56.05]I don't fucking get it back.
[258:04.97]Well, when I built it down here, it was like, oh, I had to build it here.
[258:11.69]I had to build one of these down here, and then it was like, oh, make sure to go into gadget mode and put it down.
[258:15.70]I didn't know that's how it worked.
[258:18.78]I thought it was like a permanent, like, teleporter upgrade for the... Wait, why can I... I can still do it.
[258:39.94]I think I'm fine.
[258:41.61]I'm fine.
[258:41.89]I can still do it.
[258:47.71]I can still do it.
[258:51.44]Yeah, we're good.
[258:53.60]Alright, I want to go get some slimes here.
[259:00.89]Free food.
[259:32.62]Okay.
[259:34.32]Let's go.
[259:34.70]Now.
[259:43.29]Let me get my stuff that I want to get.
[259:45.05]They were beets.
[259:46.59]They were... There was new slimes.
[259:49.59]There was a rock slime.
[259:50.45]There was a... There was a stealth assassin slime.
[259:57.47]Let's not blow it, please.
[260:25.87]Alright, here we go.
[260:26.55]Yep, here we go.
[260:43.30]Oh, you're too big.
[260:44.92]But I did get one of the, one of the plorts.
[260:52.76]I can use that.
[260:54.08]Okay.

[261:10.42]What's going on over there?

[267:24.29]Backpack size, not capacity.
[267:26.05]Okay.
[267:31.50]I wonder what it needs.
[267:52.10]Okay, for a second I thought everybody died in here.
[267:55.02]But they didn't.
[267:56.46]That's just, there was nothing in there to begin with.
[267:58.26]Alright, so what do these guys like?
[268:00.34]Is it fruits?

[270:34.96]Don't retire any.
[270:35.80]Keep them all.
[270:38.40]Yeah, I mean, but they're not going to be worth... The lords aren't worth anything.
[270:42.71]And if I have to keep feeding a dozen of these, I feel like I'm going to waste food. ...
[271:00.40]Okay.

[293:52.95]He hates us.
[293:53.61]He's not reading chat.
[293:54.51]What?
[293:56.19]What are you on about?
[294:21.27]Alright, store it.
[294:34.64]What the fuck is that?
[295:03.53]Alright, cool.
[295:05.93]Let me go get the other slime that's down here.
[295:09.35]I'm going to bring him out.
[295:14.80]I'm going to put him in that with the other rocks.
[295:17.56]And feed it a rock.
[295:18.24]I think that's a great idea.
[295:21.26]Do you hear my voice right now?
[295:22.94]I don't know why this is happening, but it is.
[295:27.20]Hey.
[295:29.62]Come with me.
[295:44.67]And then I'm going to feed a rock to this.
[295:49.65]Makes the most logical sense, I believe.
[295:55.30]Couldn't eat one.
[295:55.84]I guess I'll pull it if it's not.
[295:58.88]Alright, we need, um, did you eat one?
[296:00.50]Alright, there we go.
[296:02.86]Perfect.
[296:04.98]Perfect.
[296:05.32]Let's go.
[296:06.94]It's time to continue.
[296:13.31]I think everyone's fine.
[296:14.19]I could refill some fruit.
[296:16.59]He's not ready yet?
[296:22.17]No, not quite.
[296:22.65]Alright.
[296:24.23]Alright.
[296:24.89]I'm going now.
[296:28.55]I need to find sand.
[296:29.53]I'm going this way.
[296:48.56]The inventory slots?
[296:49.45]I need sand.
[296:50.49]I need, what, like, silky sand or something?
[296:56.65]Which I don't have.
[296:57.43]Maybe it's on a beach?
[297:02.66]Could NPCs have feelings if they're programmed to?
[297:05.00]Oh, a thinking face.
[297:21.40]Mm-hmm.
[297:22.60]No.
[297:32.35]Okay.
[297:34.81]Let's go.
[297:35.77]Stop at Wendy's on your way back.
[297:40.06]No, that's actually not a bad idea.
[297:44.08]Oh, somebody said food.
[297:44.88]It means stream's ending in like 30 minutes.
[297:48.06]Actually true, though.
[297:51.89]Didn't I tell you guys, like, if you want a stream to turn off, just talk about food after, like, 7 or 8 o'clock Pacific.
[297:59.22]That's the quickest way for me to be like, oh yeah, food, eating, humans, I eat, I need that.
[298:12.05]I want the beep.
[298:20.69]I'm looking for... I guess I can take more rocks.
[298:23.85]That's fine.
[298:32.31]I do want the reclin though.
[298:46.64]Do you recommend eating any of these?
[298:48.32]I don't think they're edible.
[298:51.75]Not the humans, though.
[298:52.77]I don't think.
[298:53.19]Not the humans.
[298:54.73]At least.
[298:55.05]You're going to play Breath of the Wild tomorrow.
[299:01.10]Yes.
[299:05.98]I want to bring this guy back.
[299:17.13]Jesus.
[299:17.35]Jesus.
[299:28.25]I still have not found the map fragment thing here.
[299:30.96]Which is kind of surprising.
[299:46.86]Can I break these or something?
[299:58.93]Oh, no, I don't want the honey.
[300:00.65]Okay.
[300:12.07]Ooh, meat.
[300:14.67]I have so many chickens.
[300:33.33]What's better, Greek or Italian food?
[300:35.05]Uh, that is very hard.
[300:36.35]Depends on the day.
[300:40.27]I want to say Italian.
[300:41.76]Because Italian food is just... Chicken parm or... You know, like a fucking fish.
[300:50.73]You know what I'm saying?
[301:06.83]No, all jokes aside, Italian food is like one of my favorite.
[301:09.85]Mexican, Italian, and Greek are probably one, two, and three.
[301:15.71]Probably in that order as well.
[301:19.66]I'm a sucker for American food too, though.
[301:21.20]Just like that.
[301:21.62]Just be hot dogs, hamburgers, turkey sandwiches.
[301:26.10]Just like the... Whoa, give me a bunch of these.
[301:28.70]Is that like a barbecue?
[301:37.46]Brisket's one of my favorite things in the world.
[301:39.00]I mean, that's kind of that style.
[301:45.35]I like a lot of different things.
[301:46.85]I really do.
[302:02.00]Good old-fashioned American food.
[302:04.56]Yeah.
[302:06.82]For sure.
[302:15.72]Well, I'm going to have a ton of these now.
[302:17.47]They're going to need their own pen.
[302:19.67]24?
[302:21.31]That's a lot.
[302:21.87]French fries?
[302:36.11]French fries?
[302:42.68]Well, they're actually not called french fries, right?
[302:44.56]Aren't they called crisps?
[302:50.00]No.
[302:51.40]Oh man, I got that wrong.
[302:54.55]What is it?
[302:54.97]It's chips, right?
[302:58.07]Chips are fries.
[302:59.79]Crisps are chips, right?
[303:01.35]Yeah, so it's not french fries.
[303:04.21]They're chips.
[303:06.26]Isn't that what a lot of EU calls french fries?
[303:10.08]Oh, another L. Oh, another L. That's British.
[303:18.95]Fries are French.
[303:20.55]Okay, if you're from France, what do you call French fries?
[303:22.65]What are they called?
[303:25.53]Chips?
[303:32.65]Frites?
[303:33.71]Just fries.
[303:35.89]Frites.
[303:38.55]Okay, yeah, so...
[303:46.30]I need this.
[303:54.17]I'm just going to farm over here for a sec because I need this.
[304:01.21]Silky sand is over here on the beach.
[304:02.65]I need 10 of them.
[304:12.62]Come on, how can there not be any?
[304:15.74]There's not any.
[304:21.02]Oh my god.
[304:34.21]Hey, what'd you do with my stuff?
[304:36.05]Where did my silky sand go?
[304:39.03]I just lost all of it.
[304:47.60]Oh my god, get out of the way.
[305:07.71]Sand?
[305:15.66]Don't jump that.
[305:16.40]Don't be an idiot.
[305:33.17]I need a lot more than this.
[306:07.84]I'm trying to think of some other foods that I like.
[306:09.51]I just like sat there.
[306:10.35]It was silent.
[306:11.13]I just was in my own world for at least a full minute.
[306:17.57]I was gone.
[306:18.49]I was not even sitting here.
[306:20.96]I was in my own head thinking about how good brisket was.
[306:23.78]I was like, oh yeah, brisket.
[306:26.36]Man, that's good shit.
[306:28.24]And I forgot I was playing.
[306:29.81]I was just sitting here.
[306:41.84]Meat brain.
[306:42.66]Yeah, a good brisket is you do the food dancing.
[306:54.13]No, I don't even know why I'm telling you guys this.
[306:56.87]Whenever I eat something I like, that I really like, I just kind of start going like... I just start punching the air.
[307:08.04]I'm kind of just like...
[307:12.81]Does anybody else do that?
[307:16.17]If it's really good and I'm like, oh, this is awesome.
[307:18.27]Yeah.
[307:22.09]I feel like other people do that.
[307:28.62]Stop shooting the fucking sand.
[307:45.36]I think my body just gets bored.
[307:48.97]That's the problem.
[307:50.59]My mind is focusing so hard on how much I like the thing that my body's like, hey, how come I'm not involved?
[307:54.91]Why am I not involved?
[307:55.89]The mind is having a good time.
[307:56.99]Let's throw some punches.
[308:05.04]I still only have three sand.
[308:07.96]This is bullshit.
[308:27.40]I think like over here, right?
[308:31.78]I'll give this like another two minutes.
[308:32.83]I can't replicate it or anything, right?
[308:43.94]There's no sand at this beach.
[308:55.30]How can there be no sand on this beach?
[308:56.78]I think I'm ready to go back.
[309:09.09]There we go.
[309:09.69]Let's get that.
[309:24.64]How do I get up there?
[309:30.72]Sand comes from the mud?
[309:32.54]Geyser is on the ground.
[309:33.72]Really?
[309:34.00]Okay.
[309:35.42]I thought they just scattered around randomly.
[309:36.68]How do I get up there?
[309:57.49]How do I get up here?
[310:19.31]No, no, no, no, no.
[310:20.43]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[310:22.09]I want... Thank God.
[310:25.15]Alright, nice.
[310:28.94]Now I have... Alright, good.
[310:35.74]I haven't been up here yet.
[310:46.61]Have I been up here?
[310:50.80]Yeah, I was earlier.
[310:52.04]I don't know.
[310:55.25]I'm going back.
[310:56.27]I can't get rid of any of this stuff, so I'm just going to get out of here.
[310:59.81]I have tons of new slime, so... How have I not found the map thing?
[311:13.22]What's your favorite Mexican dish?
[311:16.96]I can't answer that.
[311:19.62]I actually can't answer that question.
[311:22.97]Some days I just feel like a wet burrito.
[311:29.57]Just a wet burrito.
[311:34.42]You can eat it with a fork and knife.
[311:38.82]I love tacos.
[311:41.20]I love... I love everything.
[311:50.64]So yeah, soggy, wet burrito just covered in sauce.
[311:55.55]And you just like you eat it.
[311:57.45]It's like a stew almost sometimes.
[312:22.20]Favorite frozen pizza?
[312:23.08]It used to be Dr. Oaker's, but you can't really find it anymore.
[312:26.52]The last few years.
[312:31.93]Where would you place plain cottage cheese on a tier list?
[312:37.18]Um, it can't be plain.
[312:38.78]I would say cottage cheese with salt and pepper is pretty high.
[312:45.84]think a lot of people sleep on cottage cheese it's really good for you has a lot of nutrients very dense it's really good but you have to put salt and pepper on it salt and pepper and that's it just eat it like that just pepper pepper and cottage cheese need to be together
[313:12.72]I don't like cottage cheese if anyone puts anything with sweetness or anything.
[313:15.78]No, no, no.
[313:16.06]Alright, I need another pen.
[313:21.66]I have so many of these.
[313:23.55]And I'll do this and maybe... I don't know.
[313:30.31]Cottage cheese is with sweet stuff like apples.
[313:32.89]Um, I prefer it with just pepper on it.
[313:34.65]Just salt and pepper.
[313:39.44]No fruit?
[313:39.88]Nope.
[313:40.56]Salt and pepper.
[313:43.41]You already have the anglers with rock.
[313:45.47]Yeah, but I think I want to do anglers and something else.
[313:49.53]Anglers and the ringtail.
[313:52.11]Would that be cool?
[313:58.89]So let me go to the pen that I made down here.
[314:00.80]Hold on.
[314:01.30]Where is it?
[314:03.24]How am I even going anymore?
[314:07.70]Cottage cheese and parmesan is good.
[314:10.10]I've never had that.
[314:12.17]But I had a Doctor... Not Doctor Oakers.
[314:14.93]I had... What the hell?
[314:17.39]DiGiorno's.
[314:18.21]DiGiorno's Stuffed Crust Pepperoni Pizza.
[314:21.99]That's very high.
[314:23.81]It's exceptionally high.
[314:44.47]you guys hang out there for now um I guess I'll do another one over here should I not be putting the solar shield on everything I feel like I shouldn't be
[315:15.08]Okay.
[315:20.71]They eat meat.
[315:22.09]Oh, shit.
[315:22.97]The chickens.
[315:23.67]I put them in the wrong spot.
[315:26.59]Um, okay.
[315:30.09]Uh... Hold on.
[315:39.88]I'm gonna transfer them here.
[315:50.24]Okay, I gotta hold on.
[315:58.70]I'm gonna do a huge chicken transfer.
[316:03.73]Yeah, DiGiorno's stuffed crust pizza is phenomenal.
[316:20.60]The Red Baron French Bread Pizzas.
[316:24.12]That's like a high 9.
[316:25.12]Alright, now we can clean this out a little bit.
[316:31.84]That's better.
[316:33.60]Alright, very good.
[316:35.35]Let's go dump all these in the other one.
[316:38.75]Let's go.
[316:44.99]You've never had a French Bread Pizza?
[316:46.23]Oh, it's so good.
[316:49.32]It's so good.
[316:51.40]That Red Baron Supreme French bread pizza from the other night.
[316:55.71]Jesus.
[316:56.45]That was close to a 10.
[316:58.87]That was like a 9.5.
[317:00.17]It was unbelievably good.
[317:02.93]Where's the audio?
[317:18.24]Alright.
[317:18.62]I got food.
[317:23.89]Maybe a little bit more.
[317:24.45]This is going to be worth a lot too.
[317:29.39]Do you guys eat meat?
[317:42.70]Fruits?
[317:42.98]Alright, well here, eat these.
[317:53.15]You guys good?
[317:55.13]Okay, I need to kind of sneak in here and grab these.
[318:09.48]Cool.
[318:21.32]I think I should do...
[318:25.01]These two are going to be worth a lot right now, right?
[318:26.66]I think I'm just going to combine these.
[318:32.98]Why not?
[318:33.26]Is that a bad idea?
[318:39.84]Anyone disagree?
[318:47.55]I'm just going to do it.
[318:49.75]Do they need light protection?
[318:51.55]I don't think they do.
[318:55.04]Okay, let's just do that.
[318:58.31]Cool.
[319:03.03]Whoa.
[319:04.51]What?
[319:06.47]That was cool.
[319:09.82]So when do they, um... When do they stop doing that?
[319:17.33]It's dead?
[319:28.70]Oh, it needs to be nighttime.
[319:29.90]Oh, shit.
[319:30.34]Okay.
[319:32.51]Oh, fuck.
[319:32.99]Alright, I'll be back.
[319:33.55]I'll be right back.
[319:35.27]I'll be right back.
[319:49.08]Well, the reason I want to combine them is because when I feed them, I'll get both forts.
[319:53.76]Which is a huge deal.
[319:56.00]How much are these angler ones worth?
[319:59.93]50?
[320:00.74]Oh yeah.
[320:01.44]Alright, I'll feed everybody.
[320:07.72]Hold on.
[320:08.14]I'm coming in to feed.
[320:10.12]Uh... Oh god.
[320:14.48]I haven't eaten in days or something.
[320:18.30]This is bad.
[320:29.75]Okay.
[320:44.38]Okay, so these guys eat fruit, right?
[320:47.52]Yep.
[321:02.74]Okay, now who eats the vegetables?
[321:04.44]These guys?
[321:21.02]What do you guys eat?
[321:23.06]Vegetables?
[321:23.78]Shit.
[321:24.38]I just used them all.
[321:30.06]You guys eat fruit?
[321:33.54]Okay.
[321:41.68]Time to make some money.
[321:44.27]Goodness.
[321:44.67]Alright.
[321:44.97]Alright.
[321:45.19]Alright.
[321:45.59]Alright.
[321:46.15]Hold on.
[321:53.22]Do you eat chickens or something, right?
[322:01.77]You guys are good?
[322:02.31]61.
[322:04.39]Oh my god.
[322:05.87]Okay.
[322:12.28]Okay.
[322:28.07]shit okay I've got a really big overload here fuck there's so many things to collect okay
[322:55.94]He's getting overwhelmed by a kid's game.
[322:58.68]This is not... I'm not over... I... I'm gonna stop talking.
[323:18.65]I'm gonna store the rest of these.
[323:19.65]Okay, what else is over here?
[323:32.94]We have these.
[323:34.02]Okay.
[323:45.85]Cool.
[323:46.41]Alright.
[323:48.24]Everybody good?
[324:12.29]If I took you to a casino and I gave you $100,000, what would be the best game to triple your money in an hour?
[324:16.41]I would say do not go in the casino.
[324:20.85]Use that money to start a business.
[324:24.96]Or invest in skills or education or something.
[324:29.78]No, I would not take that to a casino.
[324:34.66]I would walk out of the casino with that money.
[324:37.62]That's probably a bad idea.
[324:41.04]Now you want to drop 500!
[324:41.74]Sit at the blackjack table, smoke a cigar, have a fucking vodka pineapple, that's up to you.
[324:48.77]I don't think I would do more than that though.
[324:59.26]Lame.
[325:11.93]Vodka pineapple is... That's the drink.
[325:18.81]Everybody sleeps on the vodka pineapple till they drink it and they go, wow, okay, never mind.
[325:25.65]Every other thing I've ever had is like, why would I ever have it ever again?
[325:32.37]It's smooth.
[325:33.91]It's loaded with vitamin C.
[325:54.84]Not pineapples.
[325:55.70]That's not what I said.
[325:56.52]Alright.
[326:00.52]Sell it.
[326:01.12]Alright.
[326:15.55]I have 3600 bucks.
[326:16.99]I'm gonna bring the... Somebody needs fruit.
[326:21.86]Who wants it?
[326:22.40]Does somebody need fruit?
[326:27.58]I'm very simple when it comes to alcohol.
[326:29.16]Incredibly simple.
[326:31.76]I don't want any, I don't, I don't, I'm not into like the marshmallow toasted almond vodka.
[326:37.62]No, no, no, no.
[326:38.34]Just, just give me, I just want a vodka pineapple, a vodka cranberry, or just like Two Fingers of whiskey.
[326:45.00]Like I got one that I like.
[326:46.26]That's it.
[326:56.67]I only drank like a few times every few months.
[327:05.52]There's a never-ending supply here.
[327:13.12]Okay, um... Load this.
[327:21.87]Don't sleep on 1,800 coconut tequila.
[327:25.37]I haven't... I'm not really a big tequila guy.
[327:28.93]But if I'm ever in the tequila mood, I'll definitely... I will definitely check it out.
[327:37.16]Alright, everyone's good.
[327:37.92]Everyone's good.
[327:43.34]Everybody likes tequila.

[334:42.96]And I combined them with the tail, ringtail slime.
[334:47.92]So now they are happy raccoon angler.
[334:52.01]Well, they're very unhappy, it seems.
[334:53.79]They're very angry with me.
[334:54.75]Do they want to attack?

[336:08.50]Stop drinking after like 11.50.
[336:11.78]No, don't drink anything else.
[336:14.08]You're done.
[336:15.83]Drink water for the rest of the night, and you'll feel, in the morning, you're gonna feel way better.
[336:22.13]Do not sit there and stare at that fucking 12.45 a.m.
[336:25.65]shot.
[336:25.91]Yeah!
[336:26.17]Yeah!
[336:30.86]Okay, um, maybe not.
[336:32.26]Yeah!
[336:33.22]Nope, put it down.
[336:34.74]Put it down.
[336:36.60]Seriously, put it down.
[336:39.56]That 1 a.m.
[336:40.48]shot of fucking Jack Daniels, don't do it.
[336:42.98]You're not going to want to do that.
[336:44.02]You're going to wake up in the morning.
[336:45.03]You're going to be like, why the fuck did I do that?
[336:46.81]It was the shot of Jack Daniels.
[336:48.37]You're going to be able to rewind and go, the shot of Jack Daniels at 145 is what fucked me up bad and put me over the edge.
[337:01.31]At about 12, 15, you should treat alcohol like you're a gremlin.
[337:10.98]And just start doing, start doing water.
[337:15.92]Because, no, what, what, what, like, happens at 2 o'clock in the morning?
[337:19.94]Not, like, fuck that.
[337:21.40]No.
[337:25.10]No, I don't, no.
[337:26.46]At, like, 2, 3 plus AM, it's, no.
[337:35.13]After midnight, it's time to end the party here.
[337:43.62]So if you're sitting there and it's like, you know, 12, 30, 1 a.m.
[337:46.38]right now, and it's like, you know, I'm on Pacific, so I don't know where you are, but... 12, 30.
[337:53.43]1 a.m.
[337:55.17]No more.
[337:56.95]What happens at 2 a.m.?
[337:59.33]I join a stream and ask where the... Wait, what?
[338:04.72]With the nearest barbecue?
[338:06.27]I don't know.
[338:06.65]I couldn't even read what he said.
[338:13.19]Drinking is for nighttime, though.
[338:17.11]Yeah, you got a solid... Alright.
[338:19.59]If you start... Oh, I'm going to have some drinks tonight.
[338:22.54]Maybe I'm going to go with some friends.
[338:23.70]What am I going to do?
[338:24.30]I'm going to go do something, right?
[338:25.30]There's been plenty of opportunity to do that.
[338:26.84]I do... People come to Vegas a lot.
[338:29.56]And it's like, oh, let's go do something.
[338:31.86]You cross that threshold of...
[338:33.90]You've got, like, from, like, 7 to 8 p.m.
[338:38.02]to, like, 1 a.m.
[338:39.19]You're talking about, like, six straight hours of drinking.
[338:44.71]That's... You need to... At that point, you're kind of... You're good.
[338:57.24]What am I talking about?
[338:57.86]I'm talking about drinking after midnight.
[338:59.80]Or drinking after 1 a.m.
[339:01.10]Or after 2.
[339:02.22]After 1.30 p.m.
[339:13.15]Boomer goes out at 6 and is... What?
[339:15.79]No, I didn't say that!
[339:17.97]I didn't say that.
[339:18.64]Okay, at midnight you don't have to go, well, fellas, it's 12 o'clock and if I don't get home, I'll turn into a pumpkin, right?
[339:26.08]You don't have to do that.
[339:26.66]You just stay out.
[339:30.33]No, you can hang out still.
[339:41.68]Backtracking Barry?
[339:42.86]No, that's not ba- I didn't say you had to leave.
[339:46.41]I didn't say you had to, like... If you're- I didn't say you had to leave.
[339:51.61]If- okay, if you're hanging out with friends at, like, a buddy's house, and it's like... You don't have to just leave.
[339:57.51]Stay.
[339:58.63]Just don't drink.
[340:01.35]After 1230.
[340:01.79]After 130.
[340:03.21]It's a- okay, it's like a- it's like a Comcast guy window.
[340:07.87]Between 12 and 130.
[340:11.77]There you go.
[340:26.72]And take a fucking lift.
[340:28.62]Takeovers.
[340:29.50]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[340:31.76]For the love of God.
[340:33.52]For the love of God, please.
[340:42.65]Alright.
[340:44.58]Why was he screaming at us?
[340:45.92]I wasn't screaming at you.
[340:59.40]Drink some water for eight hours on a stream.
[341:01.06]I mean, I kind of do that already.
[341:02.86]Oh, yeah, I'm not going to tell you how you should drink if you're of the age to drink.
[341:13.61]Just be careful.
[341:14.55]Look, I'm 37.
[341:14.97]Okay?
[341:16.85]Listen to me.
[341:17.55]I'm... I'm... Listen to me.
[341:18.63]I'm your goddamn grandpa.
[341:19.67]Okay?
[341:20.31]I'm your goddamn grandpa.
[341:23.11]Listen to your grandpa.
[341:26.54]Alright, so I've walked in a circle, uh, for, you know, 10 straight minutes.
[341:31.12]That's how we know that, uh, time to, uh, probably turn the stream off.
[341:36.52]I did the build the Minecraft wall and, uh, take the Minecraft wall down 10 times while we talked about something.
[341:46.77]You're 37, Omega Lull?
[341:48.85]Oh, come on!
[341:53.92]He's a rambling old man now.
[341:55.88]What?! !
[342:09.09]Alright, this game is really fun.
[342:10.85]We might pick this back up again.
[342:12.99]I definitely want to... I want to do Breath of the Wild tomorrow, though.
[342:21.04]Between 12 and 1.30.
[342:21.96]That's it.
[342:26.04]Vodka pineapple.
[342:27.72]Vodka cranberry.
[342:31.53]Good whiskey.
[342:33.35]And just drink responsibly.
[342:36.53]That makes me an old man.
[342:41.31]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[342:48.70]Breath of the Wild will start probably closer to 3 tomorrow, not 2.
[342:56.93]So that's what we're going to do.
[342:57.93]Breath of the Wild, we'll continue playing it.
[342:59.25]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[343:00.43]Thanks for watching.
[343:01.27]This has been Slime Rancher 2.
[343:02.63]It's good.
[343:04.37]It's kind of just Slime Rancher 1 again.
[343:08.00]But it feels like they have Slime Rancher 1 and they're like, let's just make that again and put a bunch of other shit in it.
[343:16.96]And that's not a complaint.
[343:19.40]Like I said, it's great to get more of that game.
[343:28.78]Anyways.
[343:35.40]Hold on a second.
[343:43.24]Is... Is the Vinesauce stuff going on right now?
[344:05.54]Yeah?
[344:06.84]Is Joel going right now?
[344:11.43]Alright, cool.
[344:12.61]I believe, I think Joel and all the rest of the Vinesauce crew there, I think they're doing a charity event right now.
[344:22.89]So, I'm gonna raid Joel.
[344:32.39]Yeah, let's go say hello.
[344:35.58]Go support their streams and everything.
[344:42.40]They do insights called Stream of Conscious for St.
[344:46.93]Jude's Children's Hospital.
[344:48.93]And I believe he's doing Vine Wrestle.
[344:50.55]So, I mean, like, go enjoy that.
[344:52.43]That's always a treat.
[344:57.16]Alright.
[344:57.78]I will see you guys later.
[344:58.52]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[345:02.86]Take care of yourselves.
[345:06.77]Today, it was kind of an unhinged stream today, but whatever.
[345:09.97]Sometimes it just happens.
[345:10.77]It wasn't too weird.
[345:15.20]I mean, it was kind of weird.
[345:27.08]Eating a meal?
[345:28.42]Succulent Chinese meal?
[345:44.52]Yeah.
[345:44.84]I'll see you guys later.
[345:46.67]Breath of the Wild tomorrow.
[345:47.53]Good night.
[345:47.95]Goodbye.
[345:48.33]3 p.m.
[345:48.87]Pacific.
[345:49.33]Mark it on your calendar even though it's tomorrow.
[345:56.44]Take care of yourselves.
[345:57.62]Good night.
[346:04.65]And please behave over on Joel's channel.
[346:08.37]I'll be very upset if I hear that you were misbehaving.
[346:10.91]I will actually be annoyed by it.
[346:13.01]Don't misbehave.
[346:13.79]Be good.
[346:14.65]Be nice.
[346:15.73]Be supportive.
[346:17.01]Or I'm going to be very upset.
[346:18.05]You understand?
[346:19.57]I'm going to be very upset about it.
[346:23.13]And I'll know.
[346:24.59]I'll be told.
[346:33.35]Take it easy.
