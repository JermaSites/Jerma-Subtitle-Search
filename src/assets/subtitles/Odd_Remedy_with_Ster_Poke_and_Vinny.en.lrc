[03:16.84]Shit.
[03:19.20]Hold on.
[03:19.44]I got to change my settings.
[03:22.19]I think I'm safe to show the game, I think.
[03:25.20]You might be, yeah.
[03:27.52]Looks like I am.
[03:31.61]I don't know how to get rid of it.
[03:35.39]Okay.
[03:36.67]Yeah, I'm not going to click reveal lobby.
[03:39.04]I'll make sure I don't do that.
[03:40.88]Don't do that.
[03:41.50]I did that and now I can't get rid of it.
[03:43.06]Shit.
[03:43.46]Okay.
[03:55.72]Gamepad?
[03:56.59]Why am I turning that down?
[03:59.09]Alright, I'm going to mute.
[04:00.67]Can you hear me?
[04:01.11]Can you hear me in game?
[04:02.45]Yeah, I can hear you in game.
[04:03.81]Am I better now?
[04:04.33]No longer coming out twice?
[04:06.18]Yeah, we're good.
[04:07.20]Okay, I might need to turn you up though.
[04:12.72]Okay.
[04:15.15]Alright.
[04:17.97]So we're in here.
[04:19.53]Oh my god, this game is orange.
[04:22.84]Yeah.
[04:23.44]Yeah, it's really orange.
[04:26.56]Hey.
[04:28.56]Hey.
[04:28.90]Oh, he can't hear us.
[04:31.32]Hey.
[04:32.76]What's going on?
[04:34.48]Uh, what the fuck is your face, Vinny?
[04:38.31]Me and Vinny are in the game right now.
[04:39.45]We're waiting for the two deadlock addicted weirdos to show up.
[04:45.20]Neither of us have purchased the game.
[04:47.40]You guys don't even have the game.
[04:48.48]We're sitting here hanging out waiting for you.
[04:51.04]Are we on Steam or what are we on right now?
[04:53.87]Steam.
[04:54.35]Odd Remedy.
[04:56.14]let me go on steam I think it's okay if the code id is leaked because there's a password you usually make us wait so I thought it would be fun for a change that's true okay um uh Vinny they're in the Discord call right now talking I don't know you probably have he's he's muted and deafened
[05:20.10]No, he's talking about the gamester.
[05:22.76]He's not unmuting because he's upset with you two.
[05:25.41]So he's telling me he's not unmuting.
[05:28.97]How are we going to fix this shit, sir?
[05:30.17]How are we going to fix this shit when we get a game?
[05:31.65]What do we say?
[05:34.54]Yeah, there I am.
[05:37.60]Okay, cool.
[05:38.04]My face is really cool.
[05:38.86]What if it's like a hiccups thing?
[05:40.76]Where we just say something mean and he forgets about the first thing.
[05:45.23]Vinny, talk a little more.
[05:47.87]Hi.
[05:48.45]What's going on, guys?
[05:49.73]Hi.
[05:50.17]That's very odd.
[05:53.05]Very odd remedy.
[05:56.62]You guys feeling good?
[05:57.52]You want to get odd with it?
[06:00.08]I feel very odd.
[06:01.88]I'm in here.
[06:04.17]Wait, who's Jerry?
[06:05.97]Oh, Jerry's in here now?
[06:08.79]Oh, okay.
[06:09.75]Yeah, make sure when you get in, you mute.
[06:16.18]Oh, Jerry is connecting.
[06:17.28]Jerry disconnected.
[06:18.88]What the fuck?
[06:20.08]Usually you're Jerry.
[06:21.30]Sometimes you're Jerry.
[06:22.46]Yeah.
[06:23.54]Do people call you Jerry?
[06:24.76]Anybody else's butt hurt?
[06:25.87]Um, sometimes people do it as like a funny little thing.
[06:30.25]Oh, okay.
[06:36.08]Oh, we're in prison right now.
[06:37.38]Is this the tutorial?
[06:39.81]Oh, uh, yeah, it looks like it.
[06:45.49]Manage your items.
[06:47.07]We can buy prison items, okay?
[06:52.36]Oops.
[06:56.16]Did I do that?
[06:59.02]Hey, can you guys hear me now?
[07:00.30]Yeah.
[07:01.83]I'm still Jerry, right?
[07:03.85]You're Polk now.
[07:05.19]Why is it Jerry's phone though?
[07:07.85]I think that's your Steam name, right?
[07:11.08]Is it?
[07:12.86]It's fine.
[07:13.72]You're just going to have to be Jerry at heart.
[07:17.89]How do you slide and shoot and get souls and buy items in this game?
[07:22.03]So, I see we have a deadlock addict in here.
[07:25.80]Okay.
[07:27.71]Wait, what is your face?
[07:30.19]Yeah, how did you do that?
[07:31.03]That's me.
[07:32.07]That's me.
[07:32.90]Can I put my own face?
[07:34.36]If you go to settings, you can go to custom and you can put your own image on your face.
[07:38.30]I highly recommend it.
[07:39.75]I have a new computer.
[07:40.71]I don't have anything on this computer yet.
[07:42.41]I have a new computer.
[07:43.31]Yeah, can you see a picture of me?
[07:46.40]Yeah, I got a few to read and pick.
[07:48.74]Okay.
[07:49.06]Yeah, type germapicture and you'll get maybe a picture.
[07:53.97]Google Reddit.
[07:59.06]Here's a nice one of you.
[08:00.99]Dude, if this is the sus guy, I'm gonna be- How am I- How's that gonna work on my face?
[08:06.01]You can zoom in and- That actually is like a nice picture of me.
[08:08.89]You can even rotate it upside down too.
[08:11.32]Why do you have just like a standard nice photo of me in a chair?
[08:14.54]I have 30 of them from the house game.
[08:19.19]Okay.
[08:22.41]When your cam froze, my mom sent a picture of every- Hey, this is a new computer.
[08:26.35]Is this a virus or anything?
[08:27.21]Is this a clean image?
[08:35.92]Whatever you do, don't download Pamela Anderson video, because that could have a virus.
[08:43.61]Where do you upload this photo?
[08:45.31]Okay.
[08:46.06]Okay, so go to settings.
[08:48.30]You might have to leave the... Oh, yeah, I think I have to leave.
[08:52.21]Do you actually have to leave?
[08:55.79]Okay, so you got to go out and then do it?
[08:58.30]Okay.
[09:06.95]Oh, customization.
[09:07.87]There it is.
[09:11.18]Okay, choose a custom face.
[09:23.77]Dude, what's the path to get to your face?
[09:27.32]Is it documents and settings, then desktop?
[09:30.32]It's built into the game.
[09:34.51]Users...
[09:41.81]the fuck do I get this put it in downloads instead oh that's true let me know if this is better chat no it says dropping frames okay I'm gonna try this
[10:12.24]I mean, it kind of worked.
[10:16.56]Chat, I'm going to stop streaming and then restart the stream.
[10:27.20]That's better.
[10:27.66]There we go.
[10:31.50]I like this dance.
[10:34.26]Yeah, that's good.
[10:35.14]Alright, I'm ready.
[10:36.95]Coming back.
[10:41.94]Oh, did Vinny say he was restarting the stream?
[10:46.89]Oh, somebody else has to host.
[10:48.11]Okay.
[10:49.29]Yeah, my internet.
[10:50.65]I had to restart the stream.
[10:51.95]I didn't get messed up.
[10:53.34]Okay.
[10:55.66]Do you want me to host?
[10:57.46]Polkster, you guys here?

[12:30.34]You could also name your entire drive Diablo II.
[12:33.99]You just buy a drive, and it'll be an entire thing.
[12:37.62]Put all your cool items, download your items.
[12:41.28]The Diablo II Paladin Scepter.
[12:44.29]Am I just doing stuff I did 10 years ago?
[12:51.03]Just rehashing things that I said?
[12:53.50]That's been my life has been a rerun.
[12:56.66]All of my streaming is just reruns.
[12:59.22]I feel like after you stream for 10 years, you get to have a few reruns.
[13:03.42]Yeah.
[13:03.94]Yeah, it's okay.
[13:07.83]I feel like it's weird when you replay a game, like a full story game.
[13:12.31]And you don't remember any of it.
[13:15.01]Yeah.
[13:16.65]I've streamed Chrono Trigger like five times in my life or so.
[13:21.04]And I don't know why.
[13:22.50]I just can't stop.
[13:24.18]So I have to keep streaming it.
[13:25.80]I mean, it's one of the best games ever made.
[13:29.10]so yeah there's been plenty of cases where I've been streaming a game that I I'm like oh my god this would be so funny if I what a great game this would be to stream like we all do I keep a notepad and like a document of what should I what games to play things to try the interesting games to check out and I'll make these lists and then I'll play them and I'll be like oh my god chat's gonna love this they're gonna think it's so funny and I will be doing funny little jokes like oh my god you see that dog oh like oh
[13:56.42]and people will go dude you not only did you play this you did the same joke that you did seven years ago yeah I too have this experience I even I'm playing Metal Gear delta which is a remake of three and I played the game the same exact way like in a couple spots and people are like vin you played this like this already can you do something different now yeah it sucks when you don't know your own lexicon right is it kind of
[14:24.45]There's so many scholars of you in your chat.
[14:28.60]And you don't even know you as well, at least your on-stream stuff, as well as people do.
[14:33.61]Chat, tell Jerma how many times he's had this conversation on one of our streams.
[14:37.21]Probably five times.
[14:38.03]I feel like we talked about this like six times.
[14:41.40]Every week, actually.
[14:42.84]Every once a week.
[14:46.37]It's a repeat of a repeat.
[14:48.21]It's good.
[14:48.63]The mind sickness has taken over.
[14:50.67]It has, it does.
[14:52.60]Who's hosting?
[14:53.34]What's the situation?
[14:55.20]Ster was the one that said he was hosting.
[14:57.97]I don't want to.
[14:59.13]Vinny said thank you for hosting and I didn't know what was going on.
[15:02.11]Oh, no.
[15:02.45]Poke said, Ster, you're going to host.
[15:04.61]And then I was like, oh, I just assumed you were.
[15:07.04]Well, I don't know how to do it because I joined late.
[15:08.66]You've been here the whole time.
[15:09.84]No, Ster, you know how to do it.
[15:11.24]Dude, it's, please.
[15:12.82]Host game.
[15:15.17]My internet totally died.
[15:17.55]Do you guys want me to do it?
[15:19.01]I'm doing it.
[15:19.71]I'm about to display it.
[15:21.74]I'm doing it, I'm doing it right now.
[15:23.02]I have no idea what this game is, by the way, so I'm excited.
[15:26.37]And not.
[15:27.33]I'm scared.
[15:28.47]Is it scary?
[15:29.99]It might be.
[15:30.43]The whole game is that you need to escape the island and there are spiders.
[15:37.74]The end.
[15:40.46]Okay.
[15:45.73]Okay.
[15:47.07]I'm ready to have some fun.

[20:20.67]Drive to the edge of the island when no one's gonna know.
[20:22.87]Dude, let's go.
[20:24.97]I can't even remember half of that.
[20:30.64]What is this game?
[20:31.66]This is weird.
[20:34.42]This is stupid.
[20:36.72]What did we do?
[20:37.41]I just took those drugs.
[20:38.59]What did I do?
[20:41.19]Whoa!
[20:42.17]Is that a bug?
[20:43.35]I'm gonna throw up!
[20:44.19]Dude, this is like that fucking pirate ship ride from every carnival in America.
[20:49.74]I've never felt motion sick from like... Why am I driving?
[20:53.88]How do we get out of the car?
[20:56.28]I think we should drive.
[21:00.61]Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
[21:06.09]Can we get out of here?
[21:07.80]Hold E on the door handle.
[21:13.06]Oh my god, there's so many instructions.
[21:17.07]This is real.
[21:18.83]Oh, you can point with H. Is there a punch?
[21:24.04]E is inventory.
[21:24.98]Drag a battery on your flashlight and equip to recharge your battery.
[21:28.24]Okay.
[21:30.20]Got it.
[21:31.72]Why is this game's graphics so good?
[21:34.11]Alright.
[21:37.01]Okay.
[21:37.59]Flashlight has to be at 10% or less to recharge it.
[21:40.91]F is flashlight.
[21:42.93]Our is phone.
[21:44.48]I can't click out of this screen.
[21:48.73]We have to call each other.
[21:49.69]I think so.
[21:52.21]I think if we split up, we have to call each other, but I don't.
[21:55.28]You have to unlock your phone first.
[22:00.77]Oh shit, hold on.
[22:03.26]How?
[22:09.06]Okay.
[22:09.92]Hold Y to bust a move.
[22:11.44]Every game needs dancing for the viral clicks.
[22:15.42]Oh, are you gonna answer?
[22:17.55]Who's calling me?
[22:19.51]Answer it.
[22:19.99]I don't know.
[22:20.67]Is somebody calling you?
[22:24.16]Oh, here we go.
[22:25.00]Oh, Glorp is calling me.
[22:26.02]Hey.
[22:26.18]Hey, what's going on here?
[22:27.52]I'm at work right now.
[22:28.78]You have ten seconds to get the fuck out of here before the whole place explodes.
[22:32.41]Oh my god, that was scary.
[22:34.29]Okay, bye.
[22:36.17]I know what you did last summer.
[22:39.89]Wait, wait, I want to try something here.
[22:44.19]Okay, let's go.
[22:45.45]What the hell happened to the car?
[22:49.12]There we go.
[22:53.88]Get the fuck away from me.
[22:55.10]Don't take pictures of me.
[22:55.84]I'm taking photos.
[22:56.64]I want to take a picture of everyone.
[22:57.74]What the fuck, dude?
[22:59.74]Calm down.
[23:00.79]Yeah, guys, if you're a fan, do not try and take a picture with Jerma in public.
[23:10.03]Where did Poke go?
[23:13.51]Poke?
[23:14.39]He's calling me.
[23:15.15]Oh, Poke's over here.
[23:18.84]Hello?
[23:19.24]Hi, is your refrigerator running?
[23:22.96]Why is it a FaceTime?
[23:24.82]You FaceTimed me?
[23:25.99]Oh, shit.
[23:27.19]My bad.
[23:28.19]Dude, I know who it is.
[23:28.91]Maybe you should go catch it.
[23:30.67]You can't prank call somebody on FaceTime.
[23:32.57]They're gonna know who it is.
[23:33.42]Is this normal?
[23:35.10]Who the hell just FaceTimed my son?
[23:39.42]I'm Vinny.
[23:42.61]Alright.
[23:45.63]Can we go kill some bugs?
[23:47.45]Let's get in here.
[23:53.96]Dude, I'm so lost.
[23:56.37]There's a...
[24:08.90]One shotgun shell.
[24:11.21]We have to scavenge.
[24:13.83]We have to make our way to the cave map.
[24:15.95]Hey dude, check this out.
[24:17.18]The coordinates are in the lab.
[24:19.10]I'm gonna shotgun this giant beer.
[24:25.29]I found bullets.
[24:30.86]That's actually a jump scare.
[24:32.32]What's up?
[24:33.58]We got some bad news.
[24:35.60]Guys?
[24:37.47]I think they died.
[24:38.79]To what?
[24:40.98]I don't know.
[24:41.84]They exploded and died.
[24:43.22]You did the Tony Soprano ending bit.
[24:45.40]Dude, I shotgunned that beard to death.
[24:53.83]Oh, wait.
[24:56.85]I'm alive.
[25:01.10]Dude, I'm inside one of those bags.
[25:02.74]I gotta call somebody.
[25:05.00]Who do I call?
[25:07.91]Wait, how do I call Glorp?
[25:13.56]Incoming call from Glorp.
[25:15.76]They need to stop calling each other.
[25:17.49]This is an important phone call that Poke can't miss.
[25:21.99]Stop calling each other.
[25:25.30]Yeah, is someone calling?
[25:26.66]Hey, so I think I'm dead.
[25:29.94]I died.
[25:30.52]I'm stuck somewhere.
[25:31.37]There's currently something sucking my life force out.
[25:35.65]Let me get the camera on so you can see.
[25:39.23]You see my, do you see me?
[25:41.66]You see me right now?
[25:44.76]Can you hear me?
[25:45.38]Yeah, I'm on Android.
[25:47.28]I'm on Android 3.
[25:50.69]You got me?
[25:52.55]What?
[25:53.91]Wait, what?
[25:56.77]What is it?
[25:57.39]Wait, why am I on the ground?
[25:59.98]I need scissors to save you, Jerma.
[26:01.88]Hi, I'm here.
[26:03.42]What is going on?
[26:05.58]Where are you?
[26:08.78]I'm laying down.
[26:09.58]Who's next to me?
[26:11.19]I'm Vinny.
[26:11.83]Hi, it's me, Vinny.
[26:13.21]I can't save you.
[26:13.95]I need scissors.
[26:17.31]Uh-oh.
[26:19.30]This is fucked up.
[26:20.32]Okay, alright, I'll be here.
[26:22.70]Can I take a selfie of myself?
[26:29.27]Take a photo of the cave.
[26:31.27]Dude, how do I move the phone up?
[26:34.94]It's like, this is blocking the...
[26:47.36]How do I take a selfie?
[26:54.91]Why did you kill me?
[26:59.04]Hello?
[27:00.18]Oh my god.
[27:01.12]Why did you kill me?
[27:02.36]No!
[27:06.07]Why does he get to live?
[27:09.54]Where am I?
[27:10.60]Where am I?
[27:12.40]Oh my god, this game is so stupid.
[27:16.89]Nobody can hear me.
[27:17.87]Oh my... Can anybody hear me?
[27:20.89]I'm dead.
[27:24.44]I can hear you, because you're dead too.
[27:26.36]I don't know, because... Oh god!

[28:50.20]How do I... Oh.
[28:51.74]Oh, we have to set this on fire with a gas can.
[28:55.18]Nope!
[28:56.17]Don't do it.
[28:57.19]Don't go down there.
[28:58.85]Oh, oops.
[29:01.01]Hey, uh... Vinny?
[29:03.34]I took the rope off.
[29:04.66]I took the rope off that was up here.
[29:06.18]You can't get back up.
[29:07.02]Do you have a rope?
[29:08.70]No.
[29:09.64]Oh, shit.
[29:10.95]What do you mean you took the rope off?
[29:12.77]It said, hold right mouse button to get rope.
[29:15.31]And so I was like, okay, I'll take a rope.
[29:16.69]And now you guys are stuck down there.
[29:18.86]Ah!
[29:21.04]Ah!
[29:28.23]Shit.
[29:28.35]Is he still on the helicopter?
[29:32.45]Oh, I have it.
[29:33.17]Alright, you guys can come back up.
[29:36.45]I got it.
[29:40.90]Wait, incoming call.
[29:41.76]I'm calling him.
[29:43.36]I just tried calling you.
[29:47.87]Hello?
[29:51.43]Durr, are you there?
[29:55.76]Durr, talk on the phone.
[29:59.02]Where are you?
[30:02.06]Durr.
[30:03.56]Why did they pick up so late?
[30:04.68]Wait, Pogue died?
[30:09.41]I hear Durr screaming.
[30:11.37]Yeah, I hear you when you're dead.
[30:13.47]Why did you... I was on the phone with your dead body.
[30:17.74]Spider.
[30:21.00]Oh my god, it is a spider.
[30:27.02]Durr.
[30:27.61]You can redeploy the rope.
[30:29.67]I did.
[30:30.47]It's there.
[30:31.59]Nice.
[30:34.70]I'm on the ground over here.
[30:38.50]Oh.
[30:39.44]How do I hang up on him?
[30:46.59]Nice.
[30:47.08]Okay.
[30:47.34]Now we have to just save Ster and Poke.
[30:49.02]Poke is dead too.
[30:50.02]Where's Ster?
[30:52.20]I don't know.
[30:52.58]I have no items.
[30:53.62]And I have... What the hell is happening?
[30:55.85]There's a first aid kit back at the truck.
[30:59.98]I have no flashlight or anything.
[31:03.28]What is going on, everybody?
[31:04.44]Welcome.
[31:05.13]Oh, my God.
[31:05.81]What the fuck?
[31:08.53]I died.
[31:09.17]You gave up.
[31:15.72]Okay, now we know what's going on.
[31:18.65]Do we?
[31:21.91]Um, this thing is telling me that we burped too loud, so that's why we got the spiders.
[31:25.76]I don't know if they could hear me.
[31:27.14]Did you guys hear me?
[31:29.01]Mm-mm.
[31:29.17]I hear you now.
[31:29.65]What the frick happened?
[31:30.71]Okay.
[31:31.47]Jerma killed me on frame one, and we got a six-minute respawn timer.
[31:36.18]I was deleted from this Let's Play.
[31:41.03]You made the big mistake of during a funny friend group game to get too close to somebody that's doing a funny bit with the red barrel.
[31:49.80]Why would you get that close?
[31:50.86]You had your phone on.
[31:52.13]You said it was beer.
[31:53.37]And listen, when you respawn after the timer, you start in the helicopter, but it starts over the ocean, so I parachuted into the ocean and drowned again, and that's when I was calling you.
[32:02.78]And you picked up after I drowned, so I couldn't answer.
[32:05.88]That's so funny.
[32:10.04]Guys, guys, check this out.
[32:12.85]I just sank and I was on the phone.
[32:15.41]So I didn't answer your phone call.
[32:17.59]But I did.
[32:18.17]I took too long to answer, but oh, that's... I tried to call each of you and no one picked up.
[32:23.02]Guys, if we find duplicate items, you can send them here for the next time, apparently.
[32:28.49]You can send them to prison.
[32:31.44]I'm playing Snake on my phone.
[32:32.72]Fucking instant headache.
[32:34.64]God damn it.
[32:35.26]I don't know.
[32:36.82]I'm just trying to figure the game out.
[32:39.56]Oh yeah, no, because Jerma also hit me with a pickaxe twice.
[32:43.12]You were invading my personal space.
[32:45.47]What?
[32:52.04]Phone's compass app shows you where your missions are.
[32:55.06]You have to exit through the front gate.
[32:59.09]Wait, we actually leave?
[33:00.71]Yeah, we have to leave apparently.
[33:02.02]Is this a gate?
[33:04.87]Come on, Polk.
[33:07.05]Oh.
[33:07.35]You saw that?
[33:08.05]Yeah.
[33:09.37]Check back here.
[33:10.08]There's equipment.
[33:11.14]There's gear.
[33:13.52]I thought you said, come on, Polk.
[33:14.40]I got to go.
[33:15.50]No, I was cheering you on.
[33:18.15]Your turn.
[33:19.11]Okay.
[33:19.49]Okay, guys.
[33:20.29]Go back here.
[33:20.83]There's a bat and some other stuff, so we should bring that with us.
[33:27.38]Okay.
[33:27.52]How do you play?
[33:30.78]Wait.
[33:32.51]Alright.
[33:32.87]I'll get the high score.
[33:34.23]They're on their phones?
[33:35.43]Oh.
[33:36.21]Oh, we got iPad babies playing.
[33:37.70]I got the bat.
[33:38.72]I'll drive us.
[33:39.54]Do we have a map?
[33:40.90]Wait, is it a real image of your phone?
[33:42.40]Or is the map on the phone?
[33:43.17]Like it's just low?
[33:44.39]I think it's the real thing.
[33:45.79]Yeah.
[33:46.57]So we got to do the compass, I think.
[33:52.50]I don't really understand the compass, but...
[33:58.65]Then he's muted?
[33:59.55]No, I'm not muted.
[34:00.19]I don't understand the... Oh, no, it has the keys.
[34:02.76]We have to go to the lab, which is... My game!
[34:07.24]They're just playing snake chat.
[34:09.97]We have to go to the lab, which is the white brick on the map.
[34:14.53]I'm ready.
[34:15.13]Where are we going?
[34:15.61]I'm ready to drive.
[34:17.02]Okay, I'm explaining it.
[34:22.20]Where should I drive?
[34:22.86]I put my phone down.
[34:25.55]Dude, I'm a zoomer.
[34:26.83]How do I put my phone down?
[34:31.19]We gotta get in the car, man.
[34:33.54]I don't know how to put... Why do you need to put your phone down?
[34:37.68]Everybody get in.
[34:40.35]Alright, let's go.
[34:42.79]Alright, we're going east.
[34:44.75]I need directions.
[34:45.95]Can you put your phone out while you're driving?
[34:49.24]Yeah.
[34:51.44]You should drive while looking at your phone.
[34:52.90]It's the American way.
[34:54.73]Yeah, I'm... I disagree.
[34:58.81]It's this way.
[34:59.69]East is straight.
[35:01.76]I don't know how to put my phone down.
[35:04.10]Just change your slot.
[35:05.14]Make a right.
[35:08.21]Make a right.
[35:10.05]Go that way.
[35:10.51]Yeah, this way.
[35:11.47]And just keep going and we'll get to the lab.
[35:13.91]Dude, slow down.
[35:18.88]Lab, right here.
[35:20.36]This is it.
[35:22.50]Alright.
[35:22.76]How do you pause?
[35:24.18]I'm gonna- I'm gonna- Big Matt came out.
[35:25.67]Poke's still playing Snake.
[35:27.17]Yes.
[35:27.57]I just had- What is that?
[35:30.43]What the fuck just happened?
[35:34.68]Did he do that?
[35:35.32]There's spiders.
[35:36.14]We gotta get the last spiders.
[35:37.26]Did he do that?
[35:37.81]Did Ster just do that?
[35:39.41]To get revenge?
[35:40.87]He's- Hold G to throw items.
[35:42.41]He's acting.
[35:43.51]He's acting right now.
[35:44.46]He put that there.
[35:45.72]He put that there because I fucking shotgunned the beer in front of him and now he's mad at me.
[35:50.18]I'm dead too, Jerma.
[35:51.30]I died to the same thing.
[35:52.96]Oh.
[35:53.04]He's dead.
[35:57.35]I walked over your body and I also died.
[35:59.83]Why did you die?
[36:00.71]Jerma was taken away.
[36:02.68]Yeah.
[36:03.76]Yes.
[36:05.00]I saved you, but Jerma was taken away.
[36:06.70]Yeah, I got one of them, and they stole my axe.
[36:10.77]Hope?
[36:12.61]I'm here.
[36:15.36]I'm in this house.
[36:18.81]Alright Will.
[36:20.82]I was gonna play this fucking game.
[36:27.64]Yeah.
[36:31.47]Yeah.
[36:37.61]I'll be down in a few minutes.
[36:39.29]I'm just getting my socks on.
[36:47.74]Yeah.
[36:51.57]Yeah, I'm just matching.
[36:53.21]I gotta get matching socks.
[36:54.35]I just put my socks on.
[36:55.21]I'll be up in a minute.
[37:13.43]Yeah.
[37:17.01]Yeah.
[37:21.20]Yeah.
[37:40.30]Dude, I'm fucking going crazy right now.
[37:49.51]What the fuck are you talking about, Game Over?
[37:51.39]What are you talking about?
[37:52.96]In what world did I hit my... Oh, shit.
[37:59.18]Come on, dude.
[38:00.48]Hey.
[38:01.14]Hey, I'm here too.
[38:02.39]Oh, hey.
[38:04.47]What's up, man?
[38:04.97]How you doing?
[38:05.45]You good?
[38:07.77]Let's get a picture together.
[38:10.58]Alright, I'll try.
[38:14.72]I can't rotate my body enough to take a picture, sorry.
[38:21.02]Hey.
[38:22.46]Hey, you up?
[38:24.84]Yeah, I'm just thinking about you, you know.
[38:27.59]Just really wanted to talk to you tonight before I went to bed, you know?
[38:38.08]while just desecrating our corpses.

[43:35.60]I don't know how to die.
[43:36.36]I don't know how to die.
[43:38.50]It's been really easy for everyone else.
[43:41.07]This might kill him.
[43:42.25]Please kill him.
[43:45.24]Oh, man.
[43:46.02]That would have been perfect.

[44:23.66]What have I done?
[44:25.78]He knew exactly what he was doing.
[44:27.22]God.
[44:32.47]His scream got cut off from me at the end of the last one.

[56:49.61]Bullshit.
[56:51.21]Jerma, when we were last hanging in the game, I went and hit an explosive barrel with an axe because I let the intrusive thought win.
[57:00.81]You didn't see that?
[57:01.61]You didn't hear that?
[57:03.31]no if I did it must have gone way over my head I don't think so were you right next to me like I don't know maybe like 30 40 feet away I maybe I didn't no I just and then poke poke when I was falling out of the plane I I was like getting back into the map but the problem is I thought I didn't have my parachute so I cut it by accident so that's what you'd witnessed there did it look cool yeah you just like were floating and then you disappeared
[57:33.06]That's sick.
[57:35.82]Alright, let's do a gamer run where we're just gonna go as hard as possible and try to beat it as best as we can.

[66:43.71]Oh, what's up, Vinny?
[66:44.41]I don't have scissors.
[66:46.01]Oh, wait, Vinny's alive.
[66:49.12]Okay.
[66:50.56]Ster.
[66:51.68]Are you alive?
[66:52.62]Okay.
[66:54.28]If you drink water, you will burp, and it summons the AI director to spawn ten fucking monsters.
[67:02.80]That actually fucked me.
[67:06.71]Oh my god.
[67:07.71]Oh god, that's so... This game is wonderful.

[71:04.64]If that attracted him, that would be so funny.
[71:07.52]Sir?
[71:11.00]Poke, you gotta do that.
[71:13.45]You gotta drink- Is this the lab?
[71:14.77]You gotta drink some water and then like burp, but then do the fart instead.
[71:19.93]So it's like the fart attracted them.
[71:21.78]That'd be great.
[71:23.72]Okay, okay.
[71:26.60]Is it when you drink any water?
[71:28.19]When you drink any water, you burp, and it attracts five monsters or ten or so.
[71:32.35]It's insane.
[71:33.40]Why does water make you burp?
[71:36.14]That's true.
[71:36.82]I don't know.
[71:40.73]It should have made it sodas.
[71:55.71]Don't pull it.
[71:56.15]This game's hard.
[72:01.78]Did it just call its friends?
[72:07.63]It's Sparkling Water?

[78:31.76]Does anyone have a lockpick?
[78:37.27]What the fuck?
[78:38.47]Oh, cool.
[78:38.95]What's that horrible noise?
[78:41.09]Nothing.
[78:41.81]What if we zoom in?
[78:50.95]I think we gotta zoom in.
[78:57.90]Let's see.
[79:01.00]I still have the photo from last time, so we might not have to do this anymore.
[79:06.00]Maybe we have to do it just to skip it?
[79:07.90]Ooh.
[79:08.40]You need to enable camera flash.
[79:11.89]Got it.
[79:13.37]What is that?
[79:14.59]Can you read them for me?
[79:17.21]Yeah, I'll do a post-it in the chat.
[79:22.89]Read it to me.
[79:24.04]Yeah, yeah.
[79:25.20]And compare it.
[79:25.86]Of course.

[79:36.39]J22, L16, T23... What?
[79:38.77]I don't know.
[79:43.72]I'm sorry.
[79:46.18]What happened?
[79:47.11]I... I pressed the button and scared the shit out of myself.
[79:51.65]Okay guys, I think we get to go back to the cave now, but we need loot because there's going to be spiders in it.
[79:55.84]So maybe we drive to somewhere that has loot.
[79:59.92]I'm sick.
[80:02.08]Guys, Poke is sick.
[80:04.19]There's a police station.
[80:05.17]We can go to the police station and get guns.
[80:06.99]Yes, let's do that.
[80:07.91]Yeah, police station sounds good.
[80:10.16]Does anyone have a lockpick?
[80:11.92]Yeah.
[80:13.42]Yeah.
[80:14.36]Sir, there's a... This requires a lockpick.
[80:21.43]I'm going to sit in the car and be ready.
[80:24.31]Did you hear that burp?
[80:26.91]I did.
[80:27.73]Somebody burped?
[80:30.07]You guys gotta get the hell out of there if somebody burped.
[80:31.78]There's a landmine.
[80:34.76]Where?
[80:36.42]I got it.
[80:38.00]I own one now.
[80:39.39]You guys gotta get the hell out of there.
[80:43.49]I ain't fucking around.
[80:44.23]I'm just getting in the car.
[80:46.01]Let's go in the car.
[80:48.02]I have gamba tokens.
[80:50.16]Gamba tokens?
[80:50.70]What the fuck?
[80:52.16]I have six of them.
[80:53.87]What do we do with them?
[80:55.06]Insert into a government machine in prison.
[80:57.98]Can we go to prison?
[80:59.89]I'm down for prison.
[81:01.39]After?
[81:02.33]Okay.
[81:05.42]Alright, everybody, poke!
[81:06.82]Poke!
[81:07.50]I mean, we don't have to go to prison now.
[81:09.97]No, we're going to the police station.
[81:12.55]Okay.
[81:15.57]I'm in.
[81:16.19]Alright, let's go.
[81:18.36]This is the run.
[81:18.90]I don't know where to go yet.
[81:20.46]Uh, spider!
[81:20.92]Reach the bottom of the cave using the cave map!
[81:23.20]Where's the cave?
[81:23.86]Whoa!
[81:24.76]Drive!
[81:25.34]Drive!
[81:25.48]I can't drive!
[81:26.27]Whoa!
[81:27.37]Whoa.
[81:30.61]Oh, God, guys.
[81:33.67]Everybody said I should've driven.
[81:34.77]No, I shouldn't have.
[81:36.68]Wait, I have an extinguisher.
[81:39.84]The car's stuck, bro.
[81:42.00]I may need to push.
[81:43.67]Wait.

[82:02.79]Where's the cave?
[82:03.70]I didn't hold it.
[82:04.98]No!
[82:05.30]We're not going to the cave!
[82:07.14]Reach the bottom of the cave using the cave map, it says.
[82:09.16]Turn left!
[82:09.52]Turn left!
[82:11.43]We're going to the police station to get items to the cave.
[82:13.71]This is so dystopian.
[82:15.89]Keep going, keep going.
[82:17.08]All four of us have our phones up.
[82:19.96]Wait, do you think the police station has a prison?
[82:23.22]Probably.
[82:23.84]Maybe.
[82:24.15]This is so dystopian.
[82:25.87]Everybody loot.

[83:34.30]We need to eat food in this game?
[83:40.45]Yeah, I'm really hungry.
[83:42.74]I haven't seen food anywhere.
[83:45.62]You can buy it at the, um, in the prison.
[83:49.85]If anyone needs food, I have some water.
[83:51.85]I have some stuff I could drop.
[83:54.63]Wait, who needs food?
[83:55.51]Who needs food?

[84:20.34]There's nothing here.
[84:21.08]And pills, too.
[84:21.78]You want pills?
[84:22.44]Yeah, I dropped a lot of stuff.
[84:24.80]Alright, those are yours.
[84:26.25]Where's all my shit?
[84:27.93]It's right here, under the spider corpse.
[84:38.28]I had so much stuff.
[84:40.96]We need a lockpick, I think.
[84:42.40]Why the fuck is going on?
[84:44.16]Why did I sit in the chair?
[84:53.05]God damn it!
[84:57.34]What's happening?
[84:57.76]What's happening?
[84:58.72]Every building is the same building.

[85:19.49]There you go.
[85:19.83]Thank you so much.
[85:21.15]Appreciate it.
[85:25.67]I don't even know where I died.
[85:26.75]Downstairs, I think.
[85:27.56]Water over here if you need it.
[85:28.84]Guys, anyone hear me?
[85:30.94]Yup.
[85:31.52]I hear you, Poke.
[85:32.74]I'm stuck down here.
[85:37.24]Stuck where?
[85:40.32]I don't know.
[85:40.72]I'm on the floor.
[85:43.69]Like someone rolled me up in a blanket burrito.
[85:45.91]Yeah, where are you?
[85:46.69]Upstairs?
[85:47.61]I hear you.
[85:48.17]Maybe he's upstairs, yeah.
[85:50.70]You ever wrap somebody in a blanket burrito?
[85:52.86]Hey, we're here.
[85:53.58]Shit, it's locked.
[85:54.52]We need a lockpick.
[85:55.53]Oh, oh, oh.
[85:56.81]I don't have scissors.
[85:57.27]I don't have scissors either.
[85:58.35]Sir, do you have scissors?
[86:00.15]You ever lay down in a blanket and roll yourself like a burrito?
[86:03.16]Yeah, dude, it's so fun.

[86:08.43]Help!
[86:08.75]Help!

[86:13.10]Where's Poke?
[86:14.12]He's right here.
[86:15.52]There's also a big spider over there.
[86:21.29]That was my spider family.
[86:22.47]They took me in for three years.
[86:24.78]Dude, I need a bucket.
[86:27.30]Alright, speak spider.
[86:34.04]I'm holding it.
[86:35.64]No, dude.
[86:37.08]Awful, awful noise.
[86:37.56]Why would you do that?
[86:38.83]Why would you do that?
[86:40.47]Sir, do you have a gun?
[86:42.15]Sir, do you have a gun?
[86:43.67]No ammo.
[86:43.85]No ammo in here.
[86:44.39]Bunch of bullets on the floor.
[86:45.54]We're stuck back here now.
[86:49.04]What the fuck?
[86:49.98]Why am I stuck?
[86:53.11]Where's the ammo?
[86:53.75]Awful shit.
[86:54.99]It's on the floor.
[86:55.61]It's very small.
[86:57.47]Poke, I need it.
[87:01.36]Does anyone know where my body was?
[87:03.55]Not really.
[87:07.04]I'm stuck in here.
[87:08.62]I actually can't move.
[87:19.12]What the hell is that?
[87:21.35]Out the window.
[87:24.19]Oh!
[87:25.91]Can one of you guys help me out of here?
[87:27.23]I'm actually wedged in.
[87:28.74]I can't move.
[87:29.28]I can't get out.
[87:32.20]Where are you?
[87:33.00]I can't find you.
[87:33.70]I'm right here in the back.
[87:35.52]I can't get out.
[87:36.07]Ster is with me.
[87:38.17]I got this.
[87:38.65]Wait.
[87:38.93]I got this.
[87:42.67]Get out.
[87:42.97]Get out.
[87:43.21]Everyone out.
[87:43.68]That seems like a horrible idea.
[87:45.02]Why would you do that?
[87:45.86]What is that?
[87:48.60]I don't think it's even... Oh, my God.
[87:50.64]Wait.
[87:51.49]I'm alive.
[87:52.57]I'm alive.
[87:55.19]I'm alive.
[87:57.11]I'm like floating though.
[87:59.32]This is not right.
[88:00.38]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[88:02.72]Dude, a fucking ghost.
[88:04.30]I thought that was a flare.
[88:05.81]I thought you threw a flare, dude.
[88:07.63]Am I alive on your guy's screen?
[88:09.95]You're alive.
[88:10.63]Yeah, you're... Oh, God.
[88:12.76]Oh, my God.
[88:15.30]Dude, I can't do anything.
[88:21.87]I can't.
[88:22.47]Dude, I can't pick anything up either.
[88:24.09]Oh, I'm back.
[88:26.48]You're back.
[88:27.84]What do I do about this?
[88:29.66]You're stuck on the floor.
[88:32.61]Can you guys help me?
[88:39.80]Why are you not taking damage?
[88:41.36]I don't know.
[88:41.98]I'm just floating.
[88:44.30]Let me try the med kit, Jerm.
[88:49.69]No, I can't get you back.
[88:51.01]That's weird.
[88:51.59]I guess I'm just going to have to... Go to the stairs.
[88:53.58]I'm going to go downstairs.
[88:55.92]This way.
[88:56.38]This is as fast as I can move.
[89:01.83]Oh, wait, it comes in the chair!
[89:03.86]I can't click on anything.
[89:05.06]Oh, fuck!
[89:09.66]Wait, what if I bodyblock?
[89:11.59]No, I can... Okay, they can hurt me.
[89:18.34]Yeah, maybe you just don't have legs because of the dynamite.
[89:24.27]There's a lot of spiders outside.
[89:25.84]I don't know if you know this.
[89:27.56]There's a lot, yeah.
[89:29.04]It's PDF shit.
[89:29.72]Anyone have water?
[89:30.46]I need water.
[89:31.25]I got some.
[89:33.03]Oh, I have water.
[89:34.05]I can't do anything.
[89:34.63]I can't drop it.
[89:35.37]I dropped the one boat.
[89:39.80]Ster, do you have a lockpick?
[89:41.79]Man, I'm sure I was thirsty.
[89:43.87]Right in here.
[89:44.97]What the fuck?
[89:55.42]Where are all the spiders?
[90:03.17]Spider!
[90:04.41]Oh shit, okay, am I actually gonna... There's a shovel in here, that's it.
[90:06.98]It was kind of a waste of a lock picker.
[90:08.72]Oh, there's a roof.
[90:10.64]Oh, really?
[90:11.10]Yeah, announcing that?
[90:15.20]Oh man, I sure am thirsty.
[90:20.59]Am I stinking?
[90:22.53]You're alive still, and you're still crouched.
[90:24.33]Yeah, I'm still fucked up.
[90:25.37]You know what, Vinny?
[90:27.01]Yeah?
[90:27.35]Just bury that in the back of my head.
[90:29.51]It's gone.
[90:30.09]It broke.
[90:30.97]Oh.
[90:32.76]I'm up here.
[90:33.02]I'm dead.
[90:33.22]Well, I guess I'll... I can't help you.
[90:34.72]I guess I'll just live here forever like this.
[90:37.58]That's your new life, yeah.
[90:39.70]Can someone kill Jerma?
[90:40.93]Can somebody come over and kill me?
[90:44.23]Is Jerma bugged again?
[90:45.71]Yeah.
[90:47.25]I tried to.
[90:47.91]I was hitting you in the head.
[90:50.84]Just come over here and like stab me or shoot me or something.
[90:58.23]Use the shovel or something.
[90:59.29]It doesn't work.
[91:05.62]That's a great video.
[91:10.69]Why can't I die?
[91:11.77]I can't destroy it.
[91:14.01]I have no weapons.
[91:17.13]Whoa.

[91:45.11]Jerma!
[91:45.85]Jerma!
[91:46.87]I've been hitting you in the head of the shovel.
[91:48.03]We can't kill you.
[91:49.15]Do you understand?
[91:49.73]No, but I'm saying just let me die.
[91:51.13]Let a spider kill me and don't bring me back.
[91:54.04]And then maybe I'll respawn on the helicopter.
[91:56.42]Jerma.
[92:00.53]Just let the... Whoa!
[92:03.53]That was a bunch of shit that I saw on the screen.
[92:06.47]It did not like what you just did.
[92:11.64]That was like... I have... I come with items.
[92:16.19]That was like a Steam directory error.
[92:18.27]Oh my god!
[92:18.73]That was a Unity error.
[92:20.71]Oh my god!
[92:21.62]Did anyone just see that?

[97:04.43]And we are live.
[97:05.29]Welcome, everybody, to another day of... Okay, let's manage.
[97:10.52]Do you remember the name of the game?
[97:11.54]Yeah, what's the name of the game?
[97:16.16]Oh, dude, you got to restart the recording.
[97:18.53]You got to restart the recording.
[97:19.71]You didn't even know the name of the game.
[97:21.85]Well, which one?
[97:24.19]This one.
[97:26.76]Oh.
[97:29.83]And we are live.
[97:31.12]What's up, everybody?
[97:31.86]We are with my gang and my friend.
[97:34.92]And we are live.
[97:36.19]What is up, everybody?
[97:39.33]Dude, it really is so true.
[97:43.28]It hasn't been more true.
[97:45.68]Let me hit you with this one.
[97:48.93]And that is the reason why... Oh, shit.
[97:52.43]Do you have a thing you always say for no reason, but it always comes out?
[97:57.54]For me, it's, hey, what's up?
[97:58.98]It's your boy, Poke.
[98:00.40]I say, your boy.
[98:01.40]I just can't not say your boy every time.
[98:05.75]Your boy.
[98:08.15]I'm talking about when you were recording a commentary or recording a video, and you would have to, in the middle of a sentence, because you fucked up, pick it up on the second recording in Audacity or in Adobe Audition or something.
[98:20.98]and you mid-sentence have to pick up where you left off.
[98:24.17]So you're like, yeah, and the coolest thing about this new Spicycle is the fact, um, oh, fuck.
[98:30.14]You broke the wind.
[98:31.08]And then, then you start recording from, hey, you know, like you listen to it back.
[98:36.45]Hey, everybody, this is the Spicycle.
[98:37.89]And the thing about that is I'm super happy to, you have to pick up where you left off.
[98:42.80]You literally splice the sentence together.
[98:45.01]You do that in music too.
[98:46.27]Yeah.
[98:47.66]It was such a trick.
[98:48.92]People don't even know the secrets.
[98:50.06]Where you could like see it highlighted or something.
[98:52.00]Oh, we need a picture of a seagull.
[98:54.85]Dude, I used to even match my breath to make sure it sounded perfect.
[99:01.86]Like if I said, this bicycle is... I would come in with the best weapon in Team Fortress.
[99:08.50]Why wouldn't you just say the whole thing all over again?
[99:12.21]Because I thought I said it pretty good that first time.
[99:15.01]I didn't want to redo the whole thing.
[99:18.49]It's like when you're singing too, like you have to do a take and it's best to sing the whole line even if you only use the second half of it.
[99:27.04]Yeah.
[99:28.31]Do you sing from your stomach?
[99:31.00]I sing from my crotch, actually.
[99:36.30]Balls.
[99:36.96]You could do both.
[99:37.81]You could do head voice and, like, diaphragm.
[99:41.33]You know, combination.
[99:43.53]Yeah.
[99:43.65]Alright.
[99:43.89]Where are we heading?
[99:50.98]Colon voice.
[99:54.83]Did we put the cassette tape in?
[99:56.51]Is this the music?
[99:58.84]Someone who has the cassette.
[100:01.68]I didn't realize it was on.
[100:02.92]I was just vibing.
[100:04.07]It was in the trunk.
[100:07.47]Guys, no, no, no, don't leave, please.
[100:10.25]No, no cassette.
[100:11.01]It might be in already.
[100:13.43]Alright, now you can... One sec.
[100:15.22]Alright, now you can go.
[100:17.94]Oh yeah, I think that's the music that's playing.
[100:20.66]Cool, it gives you a health bonus when you're listening to it, apparently.
[100:25.24]Ooh, nice.
[100:26.95]So we need the cave map again.
[100:30.26]yeah let's let's in and out super fast oh did you just what was that if you were like a producer and you had to like make your uh producer sound like for your beat what would you put like drum on the beat oh I see what you mean Ster on the Ster with another one cock sure do it with another one
[100:59.17]Prepare yourself to enter the fourth dimension!
[101:04.56]Something like that.
[101:08.14]I would use that.
[101:14.75]That's the loudest 808 distortion.
[101:16.97]Can't get in there.
[101:20.72]You can use scissors to open the boxes on the floor for quest items and objectives.
[101:26.32]See, you can't get in.
[101:28.75]Oh.
[101:29.16]Oh, he's holding red light.
[101:32.74]What is happening?
[101:33.48]Why is there so many alarms?
[101:39.31]What the fuck is going on?
[101:40.97]Stop!
[101:42.51]Oh, that's awful.
[101:43.89]I do not want to hear that anymore.
[101:52.65]Big spiders out there.
[101:53.55]I took damage from that.
[102:05.74]We're good.
[102:09.34]We're good.
[102:10.17]What's going on?
[102:11.37]We got a fight.
[102:12.03]I'm at 35.
[102:13.23]I've got plenty of pills.
[102:14.75]I'm gonna drop pills, okay?
[102:17.01]I'm good for now.
[102:19.04]Okay.
[102:19.36]It's in this room, but we need a lockpick.
[102:22.96]I just ate two.
[102:24.06]Oh, never mind.
[102:24.66]It was on my two bar.
[102:26.12]Yeah, we gotta find a lockpick.
[102:27.08]Okay.
[102:28.87]There's no crafting system in this game, right?
[102:30.65]Like, I can't make a lockpick out of, like, a rudimentary piece of metal.
[102:39.96]I think you can craft.
[102:42.29]It says you can.
[102:44.25]There is, but only at the base.
[102:46.67]I got it.
[102:52.40]I got it, guys.
[102:54.82]You can go in the window.
[102:57.84]Spit!
[103:09.43]Spit!
[103:11.27]Is this game made in Roblox?
[103:13.21]No, this is... Okay, that person's just fucking around.
[103:23.30]Poke, poke!
[103:23.84]This is perfect.
[103:24.42]God damn it.
[103:25.70]Okay, ready?
[103:28.41]You found yourself in the fourth dimension!
[103:33.33]There you go.
[103:33.73]You could use that.
[103:36.45]It's a good bit.
[103:39.62]What is this thing?
[103:41.76]Is it a landmine?
[103:43.98]That was a fucking landmine.
[103:45.96]Was it a landmine?
[103:53.88]Alright, we got spiders coming.

[104:26.78]Uh, 360, oh god.
[104:28.20]We're gonna die.
[104:29.22]We're gonna die.
[104:29.75]Why are we dying?
[104:30.35]I'm gonna go out and kill that guy.

[105:31.49]There's no cars in here.
[105:33.89]What?
[105:35.59]None of these cars are real.

[111:59.53]Is that a...
[112:03.59]Should I go down?

[112:12.80]Nothing in there, except glitches.
[112:14.59]That's cool.

[112:19.22]Yeah, that's just, yeah.
[112:21.06]Oops.
[112:22.07]Okay, how do you use it?
[112:24.15]It's so hard to attach to it.
[112:25.95]I don't know, man.
[112:27.01]What the fuck?
[112:29.24]Is this actually the thing that we need to do?
[112:34.26]Yeah, but let's explode it.

[116:30.75]I just dragged it out of my inventory.
[116:37.18]It was an accident.
[116:37.92]My helmet is... It looks like, from behind, it looks like you're pissing.
[116:41.73]I really thought you were pissing down there before.
[116:43.47]Here, grab my stuff just in case I can't come back.
[116:51.80]There's a matchbox upstairs, somebody in my chat was saying.
[116:55.58]How do we get out of here?
[116:57.19]How the hell do we get out of here?
[117:04.22]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[117:14.02]I want to be the hero.
[117:16.42]What?
[117:18.07]I might have had two dynamites.
[117:19.31]Yeah, you can take that.
[117:20.55]Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[117:22.16]I'm the gas guy.
[117:22.86]Let me take care of this.
[117:23.54]Bullet gun.
[117:24.56]Bullet gun from bullets.
[117:25.36]I'm throwing the dynamite on Vinny.
[117:26.90]Do not be anywhere near this.
[117:28.06]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[117:29.26]We need to light it on fire, so there needs to be gas here.
[117:31.93]I'm throwing a bomb.
[117:32.51]Get down.
[117:33.21]No, no, no, no.
[117:34.07]Okay.
[117:35.43]It was dynamite.
[117:36.13]It was a ballistic.

[117:48.92]Fuck!
[117:53.15]That didn't do anything!
[117:53.77]So I've learned I'm invincible.
[117:54.89]I'm invincible and that doesn't work.
[117:56.99]Yeah, that's weird.
[117:58.33]Why are you invincible?
[118:00.68]Um, I have the ancient text that Jerma was getting.
[118:04.12]Ah, there's a spider right there.
[118:06.31]Yeah, I'm just gonna rejoin or try to... This game needs a lot of work.
[118:09.47]This game needs work.
[118:11.08]I think you might be hungry.
[118:12.16]You're holding your stomach.
[118:14.33]Maybe you can't do anything until you eat.

[119:28.18]This is a cool game.
[119:28.86]I like the concept.

[119:50.63]Maybe.

[119:55.39]This phone was the best phone in all the games.
[119:57.42]Yeah.
[119:58.24]No, I agree with that.
