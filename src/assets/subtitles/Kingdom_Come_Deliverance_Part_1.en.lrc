[01:23.80]Hi, everybody.
[01:29.46]What's my favorite color?
[01:30.18]Green.
[01:30.58]Blue.
[01:31.84]A combination of them both.
[01:33.60]Which makes teal.
[01:36.32]Or aqua.
[01:38.58]A very light robin's egg green is my favorite color.
[01:48.27]Nobody said that?
[01:49.03]Somebody did say that.
[01:51.41]I just, I saw what's, somebody said, hey Vaude, what's your favorite color?
[01:55.22]And I was like, alright, I'll answer it.
[01:56.42]I'm here.
[01:57.22]I'm part of the Vaude.
[02:02.28]What am I eating?
[02:04.86]I'm drinking a coffee.
[02:10.80]I have a feeling that Jerma and this game aren't going to mix.
[02:13.76]Why?
[02:14.04]I know it takes a while to get started.
[02:23.95]The VODs are pre-recorded.
[02:25.11]Yes, they are.
[02:27.61]No, no, no.
[02:28.77]The VODs are pre-live.
[02:31.38]They used to be live, and now they've been stored.
[02:35.02]So, essentially, you're watching a rebroadcast of what used to be live content that has now been stored and archived.
[02:49.65]Anyways, pray to the internet gods that we don't have problems.
[02:52.39]We had problems.
[02:54.13]Took about three or four hours into the stream last time to see problems, though.
[02:58.15]We're gonna play Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[03:02.65]Heard it's a fun game.
[03:03.77]Heard it takes a while to get going, though.
[03:06.29]So we're gonna play this game.
[03:08.96]This is not one of those streams where... This stream might be more than four or five hours long.
[03:14.28]But it's not gonna be one of those streams where you can expect within the first ten minutes that I'm gonna throw an axe at somebody's head and I'm gonna pin him to a wall and then like there's gonna be an explosion and a horse is gonna drive by and like ram into me.
[03:27.57]That's not gonna happen in the first ten minutes.
[03:30.13]That might happen in like two hours once the game gets going but I'm gonna give the game the time that it deserves and the time that it needs.
[03:40.85]Let's reiterate this one more time.
[03:42.54]I have not watched a single second of this game.
[03:45.60]I don't know anything about the game.
[03:47.50]I don't even know the main character's name.
[03:51.12]All I know is this was a Kickstarter game.
[03:54.04]And it's finally out.
[03:55.68]And apparently it's alright.
[03:56.88]This is apparently not a bad game.
[03:59.48]I don't know.
[04:02.16]Here we go, though.
[04:03.35]King Kong Deliverance.
[04:05.37]Welcome to the stream.
[04:10.16]Kickstarter Whoa here comes the music It's got good music.
[04:19.30]I wonder if the voice acting is any good.
[04:20.54]I skipped the opening cutscene So sorry about that So it's like it's like quarter six right now imagine a scenario where we go probably till like 11 or 12 o'clock Eastern and
[04:36.11]So, like, six hours, baby?
[04:37.63]I don't know.
[04:38.39]I got a headache.
[04:39.41]Didn't tell you that one.
[04:40.13]Alright, opening cutscene.
[04:42.68]Let's see it.
[04:48.84]Warhorse Studios.
[04:51.52]Proudly presents.
[04:53.95]In the early... Hold on.
[04:55.67]Usually I get cut off.
[04:57.27]No.
[04:57.39]No.
[04:58.84]God damn it, somebody usually reads it instead of me.
[05:00.50]The early 15th century was a time of turmoil in the Holy Roman Empire.
[05:04.30]Didn't, you know... The king's inactivity angered many of the nobility, as well as his half-brother, King Sigismund.
[05:13.74]Alright, pretty cool so far.
[05:21.18]Here comes nudity.
[05:24.06]This is just the Bastion trailer in Overwatch.
[05:33.77]Keep going.
[05:35.63]What's left?
[05:39.41]There it is, there's my kingdom!
[05:42.31]That kingdom sucks!
[05:44.74]There's like four houses in this kingdom.
[05:48.20]Like 35 people live here.
[05:52.76]Kingdom come deliverance.
[06:03.89]God!
[06:05.09]Oh, I thought that was gonna go right into a cutscene.
[06:06.65]No, we're getting more world building.
[06:10.23]All we need now is like a Disney princess to sing about what we're seeing.
[06:13.96]And her to walk by and... Grab a flower out and walk down here and pat some of these guys on the back and... Keep singing her song.
[06:24.00]What a lovely world it's been.
[06:27.06]And she keeps spinning around and... And here we get the bad guy introduced.
[06:38.91]I'm going to zoom in to... She's in the tower.
[06:46.24]Is that me?
[06:49.60]There she is!
[06:50.00]Here it comes!
[06:50.98]Here it comes!
[06:53.40]What is that sound I hear?
[06:55.00]What is that thing I see?
[06:57.17]So many different people... Come on.
[07:06.72]Ah, damn it.
[07:07.62]Oh well.
[07:07.88]Which one of these is me?
[07:08.82]Mhm.
[07:08.90]She's dressed like a fireman.
[07:10.78]This is an old school firefighter.
[07:13.77]They used to wear cloth.
[07:34.49]I think that's the Jon Snow actor.
[07:44.62]Didn't this game, like, this game was like $50 billion or something on Kickstarter, right?
[07:55.30]So, I'm Henry.
[07:56.72]There's work to be done.
[08:01.66]No, let's just... Am I Robin Hood?
[08:04.62]What is this actually?
[08:05.76]What's the... What's the actual story here?
[08:06.90]Dialogue options?
[08:07.92]Have you been wanking?
[08:09.94]I'm sorry, that was too easy.
[08:11.86]It's just a scratch.
[08:28.35]Low hanging fruit.
[08:28.79]I know it was.
[08:29.19]Demonetized.
[08:29.55]My character class is a rogue.
[08:30.62]Shifty and silent.
[09:00.19]Now I get to make my character, right?
[09:01.49]Do I get to make my character?
[09:02.47]Do you make your character in this game?
[09:05.13]Oh boy.
[09:10.77]By means of the first two choices in this dialogue, you will select your character's default characteristics.
[09:16.32]If you're not satisfied with them, not to worry, all characteristics can be further developed without limitations.
[09:22.51]Alright, so we were chatting in the tavern.
[09:26.57]I was dancing.
[09:28.21]I was with Bianca.
[09:29.54]I was working in the forge.
[09:30.94]Alright, this is how you build your character.
[09:32.26]So let's go with... I don't want to be a useless character in this time.
[09:40.32]Let's go with the most important stat.
[09:42.18]That's vitality.
[09:43.89]I was with Bianca.
[09:45.49]We were... talking?
[09:48.53]Okay.
[09:50.13]We're only going to do vitality.
[09:54.17]I want to live forever.
[09:56.65]I reached a new level.
[09:58.61]That's it?
[09:59.09]That's all it took?
[10:02.46]Congratulations.
[10:04.60]You got enough experience points by answering a question to level up.
[10:09.02]Why would I be interested in sword fighting?
[10:11.80]Matthias was teaching me archery.
[10:14.12]I was with...
[10:15.31]I was with Bianca.
[10:16.73]Do you want a blow-by-blow account of everything we did?
[10:18.95]Give me another point in vitality.
[10:21.76]Alright, alright.
[10:23.84]Sorry, son.
[10:25.22]It's just that I worry about you.
[10:27.46]I'm going to be the most vital.
[10:30.00]I know how you've grown up.
[10:32.50]Vitality.
[10:34.43]It's hard to get used to it.
[10:37.05]Go to your father.
[10:37.73]Is that it?
[10:40.46]I'm hungry.
[10:41.09]Did I just really fuck myself?
[10:47.47]Is there like a... Is Pa angry at me?
[10:49.29]Plus the strength?
[10:56.60]Why can't I kill anything, in quotes?
[11:03.58]Okay.
[11:04.80]Bye, Mum.
[11:07.29]You reached a new level.
[11:08.07]Alright.
[11:08.59]Well, hold on a minute.
[11:10.41]You move around using WASD.
[11:12.13]You can also sprint, lift, shift, jump, space, walk.
[11:14.29]It's caps lock.
[11:15.87]You can interact with the world by using E. You can talk to people, collect things, open boxes.
[11:19.64]I'll press N for the codex.
[11:24.08]Alright, I have an animal husband.
[11:26.46]Okay, here's... There's a lot going on here.
[11:28.70]Okay, combat, horse, quest log, map.
[11:31.45]There's the map.
[11:32.41]That's me.
[11:34.53]Health.
[11:34.95]Look at that.
[11:35.37]Already 100 fucking health.
[11:39.15]What, can I put points in this?
[11:42.50]No, I guess not yet.
[11:43.64]Main level 1 to 2.
[11:46.40]Speech... I didn't put any point... Ah, there we go.
[11:49.66]C3.
[11:50.75]Do we have any skills for being really, really healthy?
[11:53.73]Probably not.
[11:54.25]Alright, let's just go.
[11:54.83]How's the... Mouse sensitivity needs to come down a little bit.
[12:00.87]Let's go game settings.
[12:03.00]No, that would be probably controls.
[12:05.44]Mouse sensitivity.
[12:06.34]Let's drop it to like here.
[12:08.04]Confirm.
[12:08.52]Yes.
[12:08.94]Yes.
[12:12.05]That feels better.
[12:13.20]Okay, let's eat some soup.
[12:18.92]Drop into... Eat from pot, drop into pot.
[12:25.02]Oh, I thought it was telling me I could stand in the pot.
[12:28.03]How would that be possible?
[12:29.03]Alright, we got some onions.
[12:33.37]That's really great that you actually reach down and grab stuff.
[12:35.71]I got two pieces of cheese.
[12:39.06]Oh, a nice little window here.
[12:42.40]Grab the apples.
[12:43.08]I feel like I'm playing this... Is this game in VR?
[12:48.47]Can you play this in VR?
[12:51.29]I need to get that last apple.
[12:55.53]Alright, now hold on.
[12:56.39]Let's make a little bit of a cheese fondue.
[12:58.84]What do you say, huh?
[13:01.38]I usually do apples.
[13:04.56]Yeah, I want to drop the apples into the pot.
[13:06.20]Okay, I don't want to punch the pot.
[13:08.78]Select.
[13:10.24]Did I put it in?
[13:11.81]Am I putting apples in here right now?
[13:16.36]I don't think that... I don't know, I... I don't think that did anything.
[13:19.06]Oh well, let's just go.
[13:21.76]Uh, broom?
[13:22.84]No, no, no, no.
[13:27.54]Bright outside.
[13:28.29]Alright, so we got the quest markers around there.
[13:30.07]You can sprint.
[13:31.59]This is a nice, pretty game.
[13:34.91]You discovered grindstone.
[13:38.09]I think this is Dad.
[13:38.89]Dad's gonna teach me how to swing a sword, right?
[13:46.35]You deaf?
[13:47.13]I said I need help.
[13:49.25]You can't do this, right?
[13:50.15]Yeah.
[13:51.39]Can you punch, Dad?
[13:53.33]I don't know.
[13:58.12]No, you can't.
[13:58.74]Okay, what do you need, Dad?
[14:01.84]At least you're up.
[14:02.78]That's a start.
[14:03.88]I need to put points into something that's not useless.
[14:07.16]I'm finishing the sword for Sir Radzik, and I need your help.
[14:10.59]With what?
[14:12.89]I'm running out of charcoal.
[14:14.69]Run to the market and buy a bag from the charcoal burner.
[14:17.65]Okay.
[14:17.91]I need some money then.
[14:20.22]Yeah, that's the other thing.
[14:21.44]He doesn't... Kunesh still owes me.
[14:23.26]Oh no, not errands.
[14:24.68]And the nails I sold him a month ago.
[14:27.04]Not to mention his debt from before.
[14:29.38]Go and tell him to pay up at least for the axe and hammer.
[14:32.28]Time to do some errands.
[14:34.92]Kunesh?
[14:35.76]Not drunkard?
[14:37.51]That'll be fun.
[14:38.79]Well, you're a big lad now.
[14:40.65]I'm sure you can manage.
[14:42.35]If not, tell him that next time I'll come myself.
[14:44.50]Oh my fucking god, my internet is still fucked up.
[14:47.98]You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[14:51.90]You gotta be kidding me.
[14:53.14]We haven't even been live for fucking 10 seconds.
[14:54.62]Oh my fucking god.
[14:55.28]This is such a joke.
[14:55.94]Dude, I wish like... So fucking ridiculous.
[15:17.25]Her name is Bianca.
[15:19.09]Right, so make sure Bianca draws me a nice cool one.
[15:23.59]Thanks for the business class internet, Comcast.
[15:26.44]You know, the thing that I pay like 130 fucking dollars a month for.
[15:30.22]Oh my god, what a piece of garbage.
[15:31.94]I fucking hate this company.
[15:35.48]Well, I might not be able to stream tonight, apparently.
[15:38.40]Oh my god.
[15:39.90]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[15:56.52]Maybe I should pay them less.
[15:59.10]Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[16:00.60]Um... Yeah, this is, like, unbearable.
[16:09.82]We can't even play.
[16:21.15]I mean, I can understand, like, maybe after, like, a couple hours.
[16:23.55]Oh, I am so angry right now.
[16:29.32]It's not the router.
[16:30.39]This is just a problem that I have all the fucking time with Comcast.
[16:33.95]I literally have to move.
[16:36.19]That's what has to happen here.
[16:37.89]Like, that's the stupid thing about this whole situation.
[16:40.57]I have to move my house.
[16:42.34]I have to move.
[16:46.58]Because, like, this just keeps happening over and over again.
[16:51.34]We had, like, a good, like, two or three months in a row where there were no problems at all, and now, like, here it is again.
[17:01.26]Ay, ay, ay.
[17:05.82]Come to my house.
[17:08.30]I'm going to sit here and see if it gets any worse for a minute here.
[17:12.04]Let's just chill.
[17:13.96]I'm going to put some text on the screen that says text.
[17:18.95]Hold on.
[17:25.23]Waiting it out.
[17:26.21]Let's see what happens.
[17:30.16]Waitering it out.
[17:31.62]I'm being a waitress.
[17:39.97]Move your router a few feet and shake it a bunch of times.
[17:50.11]I'm either going to have to move my house or I'm going to have to... Somebody gave $100.
[17:56.42]I feel bad for the person that just gave $100 bucks.
[17:59.18]Because like this stream hasn't even, I'm not even doing anything.
[18:02.10]I haven't even made any jokes, no references, didn't even get any references yet.
[18:06.44]I was gonna make like 10 references in the first 20 minutes.
[18:09.26]You got like two.
[18:13.20]Thank you Ercor for the 100 bucks.
[18:17.82]Move to the best country in the world, Germany, and become my friend for all the money I've spent for you.
[18:23.52]Do you have solid internet that doesn't turn off and throttle randomly for no reason?
[18:32.55]I'm not going to call him again.
[18:34.39]I think it should be alright now, though.
[18:39.13]I'm looking at it.
[18:40.47]I've seen no drops in the last minute here.
[18:45.41]But thank you so much, AirCore, for the $100.
[18:48.53]The stream hasn't even started yet, and I hope we can actually stream.
[18:53.63]Looks like it's pretty solid.
[18:57.05]Nothing's happened in the last full two minutes.
[19:00.32]So, we might be okay.
[19:03.39]But incredibly generous of you, dude.
[19:04.69]Thank you so much for the $100.
[19:07.17]Call Comcast on stream.
[19:08.75]No, I can't do that.
[19:10.93]You know you can't do that?
[19:13.09]You want me to wiretap myself calling a Comcast employee?
[19:16.92]That's like bad business.
[19:22.00]Alright, let's try it again.
[19:23.62]Here we go.
[19:27.44]You tell me.
[19:29.16]It looks like it's back to somewhat normal, right?
[19:35.70]How does it look?
[19:37.18]Are we good?
[19:37.80]How are we doing?
[19:46.76]Looks alright so far, right?
[19:52.17]We say that now, but just watch in like five minutes when it happens again.
[19:56.97]Say your prayers.
[19:58.69]Okay.
[20:01.53]Please don't do that again.
[20:04.62]Freak out and be a case study.
[20:06.86]Honestly, the last time I had problems like this, I had to get, like, three technicians to come, like, five different times.
[20:17.95]And finally, I got, like, a guy's number that, like, he happened to watch Twitch.
[20:23.02]And he was like, oh, yeah, that's, like, fucked up.
[20:24.38]Let me, like, fix that for you.
[20:25.36]Now it's, like, happening again.
[20:26.48]I gotta get that guy's number again.
[20:28.54]Like, what were we doing before we had to go pay people or we had to go, like, get money from somebody, right?
[20:36.86]Alright, let's, like, ride a horse.
[20:43.82]Hunted.
[20:44.14]Alright, hunted game is a great source of meat, but if the hunter wants to get a trophy or a fowl, he has to learn the appropriate perk.
[20:59.70]Where did he go?
[21:00.50]And was it this guy's horse?
[21:01.66]Is this the guy I need to talk to?
[21:02.63]Who's the guy that I need to talk to?
[21:13.16]Wait, wait, wait, I thought you couldn't do this!
[21:15.70]We're gonna tackle him!
[21:17.87]Combat, sla- No, no, no, no, no, we can't do this right now.
[21:20.35]What?!
[21:21.49]Slash, strong, slow, strike with weapon.
[21:25.56]Kicks, wait, wait, wait.
[21:30.39]People will notice your bad behavior and start to hate you, which means they will either attack you or run away from you.
[21:34.77]The person you anger will be appeased by your imprisonment, but you can also... Hold on, there's too much information here.
[21:41.50]Let's just think about this.
[21:44.34]Slash, strong, slower strike with weapon.
[21:47.80]Hook, strong, slower strike to the head.
[21:51.32]That's just a case.
[21:51.88]Left click is a slash, right click is a stab.
[21:53.70]F is a kick.
[21:58.52]Tab locks on.
[22:00.91]Left shift unlocks.
[22:03.23]Q is to block.
[22:05.97]And then opponent.
[22:06.65]This indicator shows roughly how much health your opponent has left.
[22:10.42]The more wounded he is, the slower he'll attack and react.
[22:12.78]When the end is near, he may either try to flee or surrender.
[22:18.55]Okay.
[22:19.75]Your wounds.
[22:20.31]Icons that notify where you're wounded and if you're bleeding.
[22:24.59]Okay.
[22:26.33]Choose an attack direction using... Up and down, left and right.
[22:31.96]You can't attack from a grayed out direction.
[22:36.52]Health and stamina.
[22:40.18]What did I just do?
[22:45.25]How do I... What do I... How do I... Do I surrender?
[22:50.05]I have to surrender.
[22:53.03]Surrender!
[22:53.49]I'm surrendering!
[23:08.01]Everybody hit me with a stick?
[23:10.14]Alright, most of the quests can be completed in different ways.
[23:13.42]Let's not... Wait, you can punch Dad, then.
[23:23.22]Just fucking talk to Dad and do the errand.
[23:28.31]End the dialogue.
[23:28.97]We gotta go find the guy to pay the guy.
[23:32.93]Alright, here we go.
[23:34.13]Buy a bag of charcoal at the market.
[23:36.07]Pick up the crossguard at the castle.
[23:38.84]Collect the debt.
[23:39.70]That's what we need.
[23:40.12]We gotta collect the debt.
[23:42.58]And then we have to... Alright, let's pick up... Let's go in the castle and pick up that thing.
[23:50.38]Because that's something I need right now.
[23:56.81]Nothing is gonna happen in the first two hours.
[23:58.69]It's not.
[23:59.33]That was just my mistake.
[24:01.09]Alright, gentlemen, can I walk through here?
[24:03.67]You die instantly in this game.
[24:05.67]I'm with you, Henry.
[24:09.51]How are you?
[24:10.01]I'm pretty good.
[24:11.63]Interesting.
[24:24.18]Beautiful work.
[24:25.59]I've never seen anything so fine.
[24:27.63]Doesn't goodbye come from God be with you?
[24:29.75]It does?
[24:30.05]Just make sure you don't botch it.
[24:31.39]When did I ever botch anything?
[24:32.47]God be with you.
[24:33.39]God bye.
[24:34.57]Where shall I start?
[24:35.49]Holy shit.
[24:36.07]Ah, shut up and give me what I want or I'll kick your ass this evening.
[24:38.91]Wow.
[24:39.54]Right away, your lordship.
[24:41.90]That's actually pretty incredible.
[24:43.06]I did not know that.
[24:46.30]Magnificent.
[24:46.94]I'm not punching the guard.
[24:48.18]Shame I can't keep the sword for myself.
[24:50.88]Well, I better go if we're to get the job done by this evening.
[24:53.76]Godspeed.
[24:54.74]See you later in the tavern.
[24:56.34]You certainly will.
[24:57.90]After today's work, the ale might even be on me.
[25:01.69]Pick up the crossguard at the castle.
[25:04.47]You learned town garrison.
[25:13.66]We have to get through the tutorial, guys.
[25:16.32]By the way, I need all that information again about swinging and blocking.
[25:21.32]So where's the guy that I need to pick up the money from?
[25:24.60]This dude, this dad.
[25:26.56]Collected debt from Kunesh.
[25:28.67]So we have to kind of just go into town here.
[25:34.33]You'll find all the information about the quest log in J. Okay.
[25:38.85]Go to the sword fighting lesson.
[25:40.24]Okay, this is all my shit I gotta do.
[25:43.40]And for clarity, they are also indicated on the map M as well on the compass on the top of the screen.
[25:49.40]That's good.
[25:50.12]It's literally just information everywhere.
[25:54.25]You discovered charcoal burner.
[26:00.45]It's gonna be so hard for me not to do this shit, man.
[26:02.27]So I gotta go collect the money from this guy so he's C. So into here.
[26:14.04]Open the door.
[26:18.75]You're in a private area.
[26:19.71]People don't like it when you go where you're not supposed to.
[26:22.10]If you enter their houses, they'll just warn you at first, but if you're caught in the castle guardhouse, for example, you risk immediate arrest.
[26:29.78]Am I- is this guy's house?
[26:31.50]What's the sneak button?
[26:36.89]Is he in here?
[26:41.90]Sit.
[26:45.57]I'm just sitting at his table.
[26:47.59]He comes in.
[26:48.30]What the fuck are you doing here, man?
[26:51.30]Nothing.
[26:53.28]Just lighting candles.
[26:54.08]Alright, let's just sneak.
[26:59.26]I'm going to drink his chili.
[27:01.75]Can I drop poison in his pot?
[27:05.27]Alright, so I'm not supposed to be in here, but I'm supposed to be in here.
[27:12.06]Collect the money.
[27:12.76]He's definitely just in here playing cards with a couple of friends or something.
[27:16.26]Oh, your house sucks.
[27:20.25]In here?
[27:29.29]This guy doesn't have any money?
[27:30.47]Are you kidding me?
[27:32.21]Yeah, go collect the money from the guy that lives here.
[27:34.23]I don't think this guy has any money at all.
[27:39.94]Oh.
[27:40.98]There he is.
[27:42.92]Okay, for a second, I thought he was smashing that chicken's head in.
[27:49.46]Don't talk shit to a guy with a fucking axe.
[27:56.38]I can just take his axe.
[27:57.76]Will he notice if I take the axe?
[28:01.79]I want the axe.
[28:04.01]I want to take his axe and have him not know I took it.
[28:06.67]What is it?
[28:08.84]There was a steal option.
[28:10.88]Where did it go?
[28:12.58]Oh, whatever.
[28:16.54]The money.
[28:20.67]Take the axe and... Hey, remember I told you... Remember I told you that there wasn't going to be an axe being thrown at somebody's head?
[28:31.85]I think we might have to change that.
[28:33.85]Pay for the tools at least.
[28:37.84]I've got nothing.
[28:38.78]Pay for the tools.
[28:39.42]I can't believe it.
[28:40.40]No.
[28:40.52]Sometimes you need powers of persuasion to achieve your goals.
[28:43.90]When talking to people, you can often choose what kind of impression you want to make on them.
[29:07.67]You can simply use speech, which however is influenced by the reputation you have at that moment with the person you're talking to.
[29:13.90]In the Middle Ages, social status was paramount.
[29:16.58]So the quality of your attire and how well-groomed you are, together with your reputation, can make a big difference to how people respond to you.
[29:23.59]If you look dangerous, people will be afraid to cross you and will also be more willing to assign risky tasks to you.
[29:29.29]That's influenced mainly by your strength and the deterrent effect of your weapons and equipment.
[29:35.20]But other things are also taken into account, such as bloodstains on your clothes.
[29:39.67]You can rely on money.
[29:41.77]In special cases, you can try any of Henry's other skills, like horsemanship.
[29:46.09]It's not only the matter of persuasion that's important, but also the specific offer.
[29:50.75]Because sometimes it's not enough to just choose according to your highest characteristics.
[29:56.07]Oh my goodness.
[29:59.25]But different approaches work on different people.
[30:01.17]You won't intimidate a tough brawler easily, and no matter how well you dress, you won't impress the nobility easily.
[30:06.81]That's because Henry's abilities aren't simply assigned a universal value, but compared with the abilities of his counterpart.
[30:13.71]So it's like a... Oh man, it's rock, paper, scissors, but with stats.
[30:19.09]You can see the values of the various abilities in the game under the corresponding icons.
[30:23.63]You can always see your own abilities.
[30:24.91]Let's just axe this guy to death.
[30:29.35]Talk about like rock, paper, scissor, nobility.
[30:31.51]No, just grab the axe and the wood cutting and throw it into his head.
[30:37.63]Okay, it's not just about stats though.
[30:39.16]The outcome is influenced by other factors.
[30:40.62]Your reputation.
[30:43.04]The level of your reputation with your counterpart.
[30:47.80]You can expect a visit from father.
[30:49.36]Okay, Henry.
[30:50.12]I don't know what his... I don't know what his... What does he have for rock?
[30:57.70]I have one rock, seven papers, and two scissors.
[31:02.62]I can't tell you.
[31:03.10]Tell him to pay.
[31:03.44]Alright.
[31:03.86]Who's going to get the axe?
[31:04.40]It's just like in Dodgeball.
[31:05.82]We're both going to sprint to the axe.
[31:25.95]Yep, got it.
[31:34.30]Take it!
[31:37.32]How do I use it?
[31:38.56]How do I use the axe?
[31:45.17]Where's the axe?
[31:46.65]Main hand, off hand.
[31:47.85]Where's my inventory?
[31:50.45]Weapons, armor, quest items, other... All?
[31:55.05]Where is it?
[31:57.91]Why can I use this?
[32:03.17]It's on?
[32:03.79]Where is it?
[32:05.57]I don't have it on.
[32:11.14]It's in other.
[32:12.18]Why is it... Why can I not use the fucking thing?
[32:15.70]You can't use item in combat.
[32:21.40]Oh, shit.
[32:21.98]I forget everything about this.
[32:22.94]Oh, he's breaking my arm.
[32:31.14]What is it, block?
[32:32.54]How do you... Okay, I can kick.
[32:34.02]Alright, that star thing up there means something.
[32:43.61]What's wrong with me?
[32:45.61]Oh.
[32:48.23]Damn it, I'm gonna get, like, fucking... Okay, Q is block.
[32:52.27]I don't understand.
[33:00.48]I really just don't.
[33:01.50]I need to learn how to play this game.
[33:09.58]Can I throw a chicken at him?
[33:15.66]Play like a chivalry.
[33:16.66]I need to see this again.
[33:20.68]I have no idea what's going on.
[33:24.02]There was a full three pages of information that I just...
[33:29.00]Alright, hold on.
[33:30.52]Combat.
[33:31.78]Left mouse, right mouse.
[33:34.42]Lock on.
[33:34.92]Special attack is abort attack.
[33:36.82]Block is Q. Draw melee weapon.
[33:38.60]I can't.
[33:40.88]Surrender.
[33:41.42]I'm just gonna surrender.
[33:46.38]Because this shit, like the top left, all that stuff, it means something.
[33:53.17]That's like where I'm aiming, right?
[34:06.06]It's a shame it doesn't have a tutorial where it freezes everything.
[34:08.88]Yeah, I know.
[34:09.98]But we were also dealing with fucking Comcast.
[34:12.88]Yeah, I figured it out.
[34:17.11]Okay, wait, I got an idea.
[34:19.39]I have an idea.
[34:21.71]What if the guard over here sees him punch me?
[34:24.85]Right?
[34:25.37]Like he's breaking the law.
[34:26.53]I'm right now just like, I'm trying to get away from him.
[34:29.61]Like, get away from me.
[34:30.37]Don't hurt me.
[34:31.69]Don't punch me.
[34:33.19]You're gonna do it in front of a guard?
[34:34.22]No, you're not.
[34:38.67]See?
[34:38.95]Look!
[34:39.59]See what he just did?
[34:49.25]This guy won't help me.
[34:50.15]Alright, what if I make him punch him in the face?
[34:52.70]Is that gonna work?
[34:53.26]I don't think that's gonna work.
[35:04.62]I know Q is block.
[35:08.68]Yeah, watch out where you're going.
[35:12.66]Do I have a move like that?
[35:13.98]I don't know.
[35:14.50]Did I just do that to him?
[35:15.40]I have no idea.
[35:19.74]I think I just need to lose and then read the entire tutorial.
[35:34.73]The background music is too uplifting.
[35:47.69]How long does this take?
[35:50.59]That's when your stamina drops.
[35:58.92]I mean, you can't smash buttons.
[36:00.18]I need to, like, figure out, like... Hold on, I need to read.
[36:06.82]I'm just going to reload.
[36:07.72]I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
[36:17.37]I also have only vitality.
[36:19.03]This guy was just chopping wood.
[36:24.01]I don't even understand stamina.
[36:31.91]Hold on.
[36:33.01]Give me a second.
[36:35.44]Jesus Christ, there we go.
[36:36.58]Finally, where is it?
[36:45.12]With combat, come on Combat The tutorials aren't here
[37:12.13]So just like boxing, just don't ever get close.
[37:17.25]I know you have to move up and down, right?
[37:22.02]Alright, just please fucking kill me.
[37:32.64]Please, I don't even care.
[37:33.80]I need to read that.
[37:34.82]I can't even read it.
[37:38.62]Where do I please see that tutorial again?
[37:49.08]I blame fucking shitty dog shit Comcast for me not being able to read that.
[37:55.88]I'm restarting the whole fucking thing.
[37:56.98]I don't even know which one even is it.
[38:07.70]I'm gonna restart the whole goddamn game.
[38:10.49]Fuck this.
[38:11.41]Restart the entire fucking game.
[38:23.52]It's time I'm not doing vitality.
[38:24.96]I'm gonna do strength and, and, and, I'm gonna do vitality and strength.
[38:29.58]Give me a break.
[38:31.76]What the fuck is this?
[38:38.10]What happened?
[38:39.14]Okay, here we go.
[38:40.74]No shit!
[38:42.73]What did I just do?
[38:43.53]I'm so angry right now.
[38:52.97]Did I get strength?
[38:54.11]Well, I hope you didn't fill your head with nonsense.
[38:57.15]Cheat code.
[38:57.47]Well, I thought there was something you're not telling me.
[39:01.13]And it's connected with that scratch on your hand.
[39:03.99]Okay.
[39:04.43]Alright.
[39:06.33]Alright.
[39:11.48]I want strength.
[39:12.86]So I'm learning to sort out.
[39:13.96]Okay.
[39:14.40]And what of it?
[39:15.58]Speech and strength.
[39:17.34]At least I'll be able to defend myself.
[39:20.54]God above, Hal.
[39:22.38]You're
[39:24.80]Alright, we got strength in speech.
[39:26.82]He gained a main menu level.
[39:31.04]Oh, my God.
[39:31.72]Alright, end dialogue.
[39:32.94]Goodbye, Ma.
[39:33.50]Thanks a lot.
[39:33.98]Appreciate it.
[39:42.19]I got really thrown off in the very fucking beginning here.
[39:44.77]Like, if that shit didn't happen, I would have taken my fucking time.
[39:51.04]We spent the first like 30 minutes of this stream worrying about if I could even stream or not.
[39:55.57]That's the only thing that was on my mind.
[39:59.17]At least you're up.
[40:00.11]That's a start.
[40:00.93]No, we're doing speech.
[40:01.92]Anyway, we have a lot of work to do today.
[40:04.52]I'm finishing the sword for Sir Radzig, and I need your help.
[40:07.92]With what?
[40:10.92]Just get the gun from the loot box.
[40:17.46]Speech and strength.
[40:18.46]No, it's not.
[40:19.04]You can be strong and talk really well.
[40:22.26]No, I didn't want this to be a stream where I don't read directions.
[40:28.15]I was going to read the whole thing.
[40:29.45]Fucking Comcast comes in and makes me have to fuck me up.
[40:36.37]We already know this part.
[40:37.90]I'm going to kick the shit out of this guy.
[40:41.33]I'm gonna kill this guy.
[40:42.91]I'm gonna make sure he's dead.
[40:44.19]I'm going to make sure that I kill this guy.
[40:48.87]I don't care how.
[40:49.57]I'm coming back with a gun.
[40:52.81]When the guy's asleep, I'm gonna shoot him in the head with a gun.
[40:56.05]Like fucking four hours from now.
[41:07.57]Hey, how you doing?
[41:08.43]Remember me?
[41:08.89]Yeah, it's me.
[41:12.43]Where's the guy chopping the wood over here?
[41:18.04]Where is he?
[41:21.28]No, I'm going the wrong way.
[41:23.50]I'm gonna go to C. Comcast brings out the worst in people.
[41:31.32]Yeah, it brings out the worst in me because I'm so sick of it happening.
[41:33.96]It's giving me such anxiety at this point.
[41:40.43]Alright.
[41:41.41]Give me your fucking money.
[41:42.55]Alright.
[41:42.83]Pay for the tools.
[41:43.49]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[41:44.11]Yeah, sometimes you can influence.
[41:46.37]I got two speech.
[41:47.09]I don't think that's going to matter.
[42:03.12]Fuck you.
[42:03.46]I'm gonna fight this guy.
[42:04.20]Teach me to combat again, please.
[42:05.60]And let me actually read the whole thing.
[42:07.98]Okay, combat.
[42:26.39]Left click and right click, strong, slower strike with weapon, hook.
[42:29.76]Okay.
[42:30.60]Stab.
[42:31.86]So right click is a quick, left click is a longer, big swing.
[42:36.28]That's a lock on.
[42:37.06]Block, raise and hold weapon and defense.
[42:39.98]Choose an attack direction using up and down and left and right.
[42:44.70]Okay.
[42:51.46]So that's, the star in the middle is just the direction that you're going to be punching from.
[43:01.28]So this indicator shows roughly how much health your opponent has left.
[43:03.84]So that's the purple bar.
[43:06.07]And that's my health is the red one.
[43:13.59]Up, down, left, and right.
[43:17.47]No.
[43:18.99]What spells do you have?
[43:20.11]I don't have any spells.
[43:21.47]I think I'm like, I get it though.
[43:30.31]That was a nice sidestep that he just did.
[43:31.71]No, he grabbed me.
[43:44.51]So how do you do those cool dodges that he does?
[43:51.30]Like he's doing this cool dodge.
[43:52.58]There we go.
[43:59.92]I'm starting to understand this here.
[44:02.22]What the fuck was that?
[44:11.39]I'm out of stamina.
[44:12.09]Back off.
[44:14.07]How do you do the grab?
[44:19.85]I'm assuming I have to learn these things, right?
[44:24.79]Blocked it all.
[44:32.00]I can't get him in the gut.
[44:36.62]Why is this guy so good at fighting?
[44:41.93]Is this guy just really good at this?
[44:50.95]Why is this guy so good?
[45:03.02]Okay, you've reached a new level.
[45:05.20]I leveled up by punching this guy a few times.
[45:10.93]He's got bruises on his face.
[45:21.12]I've reached a new level in unarmed.
[45:22.74]Is this like I'm just gonna level up like this?
[45:35.08]I'm getting my ass kicked again.
[45:42.09]So moving the mouse up and down is not... That's what I'm doing.
[45:45.87]I'm attacking from different sides, right?
[45:56.34]Like, how is he blocking every single punch?
[45:59.72]Should have went with vitality.
[46:01.00]I'm either not understanding this at all...
[46:05.02]Or what?
[46:06.34]How did I miss?
[46:14.75]I'm just like out of stamina already.
[46:22.29]This guy's like kicking the shit out of me.
[46:25.06]Wow!
[46:36.41]You can't hit him in the grey star parts.
[46:40.82]So I can only hit him in the front.
[46:44.38]I can only hit him on the top.
[46:45.94]Those are greyed out.
[46:54.74]He keeps slowing down time.
[47:02.51]So those are all greyed out, so I can only hit him from the front.
[47:08.76]But yeah, this guy keeps doing like matrix slow motion moves.
[47:23.02]I'm leveling, I'm just sitting here leveling up apparently.
[47:29.48]Just teleport.
[47:35.83]I'm gonna lose again.
[47:42.69]He's just blocking everything.
[47:51.00]This fight is so easy.
[47:53.18]I have no idea why I can't do this.
[47:56.84]Fuck you, buddy.
[47:58.14]You're gonna have to kill me.
[48:11.87]Let's restart again.
[48:14.33]Give me a knife.
[48:14.85]I'm cutting his fucking head off.
[48:18.93]He's gonna fucking kill me.
[48:30.02]Ay yi yi.
[48:30.78]Man oh fucking man.
[48:38.57]I've been blocking.
[48:39.93]It takes up all my stamina.
[48:48.29]Just kill me.
[48:49.41]Please kill me.
[48:50.59]I hope it kills me.
[48:51.77]I hope it fucking kills me.
[48:53.46]Kill me.
[48:54.96]I want to die.
[48:56.02]Kill me.
[49:04.26]No.
[49:04.80]Don't let me live.
[49:05.45]End me.
[49:07.47]I'm not.
[49:07.89]I refuse.
[49:08.97]End me.
[49:50.10]Fucking... I don't think I'm supposed to fight that guy.
[49:56.25]Is that... Is... At the current... Look, look, look, look.
[49:58.67]Be real with me.
[49:59.55]At the current stage of this game, am I... Is it even possible to win this fight with this guy?
[50:04.99]Somebody tell me.
[50:10.82]You can.
[50:11.44]Is this... Is this like fighting the... The werewolf in the first room in Bloodborne?
[50:17.12]Are you, like, supposed to fight this guy and beat him?
[50:30.81]Everybody else is beating him.
[50:32.37]I'm just not going to quit playing video games forever then.
[50:36.83]Because apparently I can't beat this fucking guy.
[50:39.15]What am I doing on Twitch?
[50:40.61]Why am I here?
[50:57.82]What a shame.
[51:00.99]Alright, let's go do this, and I'm gonna leave.
[51:03.33]Yeah, hello, yeah, how you doing?
[51:08.67]Okay.
[51:08.77]Yeah, you've got nothing.
[51:09.81]Alright, yeah, I understand.
[51:26.14]That's the way you want it.
[51:27.98]I'm gonna have to get a summon.
[51:29.50]And you can tell him what you told me.
[51:35.84]Aye, aye, aye.
[51:40.67]I'll have to get something to eat.
[51:41.97]I'm starting to get hungry.
[51:42.81]Am I this hunger in this game too?
[51:47.45]Alright, let me like do it the way that I'm supposed to do it.
[51:55.48]steal his stuff no no no no no it's very clear that I can't handle this fucking game so we're gonna wait till I get the sword and then I'm going to cut everybody's faces off I'm not gonna punch anybody I'm not gonna cause any problems because I can't fucking handle it apparently I can't do it so I I we're not doing that right now we're gonna do this we're gonna go get the money from other people we're gonna do it diplomatically
[52:24.72]I don't have any money.
[52:34.17]I need to collect money.
[52:35.33]From who?
[52:40.09]Steal it and kill him with it.
[52:42.70]No, no, I gotta get out of this area before I have a fucking mental breakdown.
[52:51.40]Let me just focus for a second and figure out what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing.
[52:56.90]Jesus Christ, Jeremy.
[53:01.11]Okay, buy charcoal.
[53:02.85]Pick up the cross, go buy ale.
[53:06.63]Try to get the axe hammer, so I can just steal them, apparently.
[53:15.48]Bruised ego.
[53:17.50]Go to the sword fighting lesson, that's probably a good idea.
[53:21.31]That's B. Let's go to B. Before I actually punch through my fucking monitor on screen.
[53:31.76]Let's go take a walk.
[53:35.04]I'm going to go walk out into the woods and just scream in the middle of the forest.
[53:43.80]Where there's weapons, there's death.
[53:45.72]The question is, what do you want?
[53:47.55]I don't want to rot in this hole forever.
[53:51.15]The monitor would block like that guy did.
[53:57.59]I'm just too old.
[54:00.37]I can play funny fucking cute video games.
[54:03.80]Not games that require like a total attention anymore.
[54:06.18]I'm going to lose to this guy too.
[54:08.72]Just get ready.
[54:09.44]I wait on the ground by the sheepfold as usual.
[54:14.62]I don't care how hungry you are.
[54:24.56]Stick to video games that are, like, fucking cute.
[54:27.66]Not, like, incredibly elaborate medieval simulations.
[54:39.81]I'm just gonna start dancing on stream.
[54:41.55]I'm gonna turn my stream and we're gonna do like Just Dance 3.
[54:44.61]Every fucking stream.
[54:45.89]Every single stream from here on out.
[54:50.20]What?
[54:57.99]God damn it, I can do this.
[55:00.21]Shut up, Jeremy.
[55:19.45]This is a long walk.
[55:24.01]Alright, let's do it.
[55:24.80]Teach me how to fight, please.
[55:28.96]Yes.
[55:30.44]Please teach me how to fight.
[55:32.58]You're too old to dance.
[55:33.36]Do I learn moves?
[55:33.84]Did I have to do this first?
[55:34.88]I'm hungry.
[55:35.70]Okay.
[55:35.94]Sword tutorial.
[55:36.86]I'm going to die.
[55:37.40]He's going to accidentally kill him.
[55:50.51]In combat, you are locked onto your opponent.
[55:51.97]You can move around A and D. You can unlock from your opponent by left shift.
[55:54.64]Right.
[55:55.70]Okay.
[55:56.64]Sure.
[55:58.22]Alright, alright.
[55:59.50]Now try to hit me.
[56:00.92]You have to put your weight into your attack.
[56:02.58]If you just fiddle around, you'll get nowhere.
[56:05.00]Why didn't I do this first?
[56:06.26]Unpredictability is the key.
[56:09.55]Never repeat yourself.
[56:12.31]Slash.
[56:13.19]Choose the direction of the slash.
[56:16.29]Very good.
[56:18.21]Not bad.
[56:20.07]Do I get to keep the sword?
[56:26.85]I mean, this is what I was doing before.
[56:43.56]Okay.
[56:45.66]You can chain your strikes together.
[56:53.64]Start a new attack as soon as the previous attack ends.
[56:56.76]You can change the attack zone or just chain the strikes one after another.
[57:00.00]Try to press left click, right click right after your sword hits your opponent.
[57:06.29]Okay.
[57:14.12]This is just the shit I was doing to that guy That's it So why is that guy kicking the shit out of me so bad Thank you In real life
[57:44.50]Baby steps.
[57:45.72]Fighting with fists is different.
[57:47.70]We're never doing that ever again.
[57:49.90]I'm picking up fucking rocks and throwing them at people.
[57:56.21]You know what I mean?
[57:56.79]I'll pick up a rock and hit somebody in the head with it before I punch them ever again.
[57:59.33]Alright, what do we got?
[58:05.81]Now we gotta get
[58:08.05]Crossguard is D. That's later.
[58:09.57]Buy ale.
[58:10.89]Buy a bag of charcoal.
[58:11.86]Do I have... Is there a save the game here?
[58:15.98]I need to get the nails and the axe.
[58:17.70]I need to steal it from him.
[58:19.88]That's the only way to do it.
[58:22.28]Find another way.
[58:30.83]You won't get any cleaner cleaner washing a trough.
[58:34.13]Alright, so I need hammer.
[58:35.09]I need the nails and the axe.
[58:36.89]So this is the guy.
[58:41.81]God, I wish there was a snap neck feature.
[58:48.01]Sneak up and knock him out.
[58:49.07]I don't know how to do that.
[58:58.18]Crouch and choke him out.
[59:00.10]Is there... If you want...
[59:09.36]Hold on, wait.
[59:11.03]If you want to sneak somewhere, make sure no one sees you or hears you.
[59:13.51]Whether you've seen it or not depends on the light.
[59:24.60]What?!
[59:25.48]No!
[59:28.70]I don't want to fight him!
[59:29.68]I don't want to fight him!
[59:31.46]No, please!
[59:35.34]Why did you tell me to do that?
[59:37.26]He's not going to remember, right?
[59:38.36]He didn't see my face.
[59:40.14]He didn't see my face.
[59:40.96]He has no idea.
[59:41.40]Alright.
[59:55.75]Let's just get out of here.
[59:58.01]Buy a bag of charcoal.
[59:59.35]A. I need to go to A now.
[60:10.34]What the fuck?
[60:12.76]Huh?
[60:15.06]Did I... Is that illegal?
[60:19.58]Is that illegal in the Middle Ages, what I just did?
[60:21.27]Alright, I need to go back to Dad.
[60:25.53]I don't think I have enough money.
[60:31.44]I don't think I have any money.
[60:34.36]Let's go tell on this guy.
[60:39.89]Because I don't think I have enough money to buy anything.
[60:42.87]Do I have any money at all?
[60:45.87]Charcoal.
[60:48.43]Do I have any fucking money?
[60:49.58]Add to basket.
[60:51.24]How much do I need?
[60:51.72]Ten?
[60:55.22]Okay.
[60:57.50]Check basket.
[61:03.68]How do I haggle?
[61:07.17]Let's talk about the price.
[61:12.57]What the fuck?
[61:13.25]There's so much here.
[61:15.62]Haggling works both ways, whether you want to buy cheap or sell, dear.
[61:21.28]You select the amount you want to pay or get W and S and confirm with E, the trader, and respond to your offer.
[61:27.96]The trader will then respond to your offer.
[61:30.26]If the answer is a refusal, he or she will make a counter offer and wait for your response.
[61:36.42]Huh?
[61:37.88]Okay.
[61:45.08]I gotta go back to dad.
[61:59.45]Alright, I need to fucking get my shit together, man.
[62:10.12]I need to get my shit together.
[62:17.12]Alright, Dad.
[62:18.44]He wouldn't give me the money.
[62:21.34]About time.
[62:22.55]Have you got everything I wanted?
[62:26.33]I went to see Kunis, but he wouldn't pay, and then he threatened me.
[62:29.41]We're telling on him.
[62:31.33]I'll sort him out this evening.
[62:32.93]I've no time for him now.
[62:34.73]You can't haggle if you have... I need money.
[62:37.61]I'll rob him.
[62:38.35]No, I need money.
[62:39.53]We're going to be very, very, very gentle.
[62:42.18]Here's a coin for the charcoal and the ale.
[62:43.92]Good.
[62:44.50]I'll get it back from that mongrel this evening.
[62:47.72]Okay, I got money.
[62:48.70]I got $7.
[62:49.88]Thanks, Dad.
[62:50.30]We're going to let Dad take care of it.
[62:55.80]I'm not taking care of that.
[62:56.66]Not right now.
[62:57.18]Not until I... Give me a real weapon, and then maybe I'll take care of it.
[63:00.39]I'm a coward until you put a sword in my hands.
[63:03.51]There's a beast in every man, and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.
[63:08.25]That was King Jorah Warwick from Game of Thrones 2.
[63:10.77]Alright, where is he?
[63:18.19]Time to haggle.
[63:24.78]Go gamble?
[63:25.48]No.
[63:26.72]I need to buy 10 charcoal.
[63:28.18]Alright, what am I looking at here?
[63:31.10]Charcoal, he has 50 of them.
[63:31.94]100 health, 0.2 weight, 0.5 price.
[63:33.41]Okay, I need 10.
[63:33.99]Accept.
[63:34.51]So now, check my basket.
[63:46.64]Close the deal.
[63:47.54]But how much is that?
[63:48.70]How much is it?
[63:50.78]Traders wealth 20.
[63:51.68]Well, your reputation.
[63:53.19]Trading items 4, you pay $5.
[63:54.87]Let's haggle.
[63:57.51]Let's talk about the price.
[63:59.55]Naturally.
[64:00.73]Okay.
[64:00.85]3.8.
[64:00.87]No deal then.
[64:16.37]Why?
[64:16.63]You're supposed to haggle!
[64:20.27]I'm just buying them.
[64:22.49]Just give me ten.
[64:24.67]Check the basket.
[64:25.91]Close the deal.
[64:27.77]Okay, done.
[64:31.91]Now let's move on to what's E?
[64:36.36]Buy ale at the tavern.
[64:37.54]Okay, can I haggle the price of ale?
[64:39.52]Can I just barter?
[64:42.72]Can I steal ale?
[64:46.80]Oh god.
[64:47.24]Oh my god, no fighting.
[64:49.08]Why not?
[64:49.28]What is this Wenceslas for a king?
[65:10.58]We've been playing for like 35 minutes.
[65:12.56]I don't even know where the hell I am.
[65:15.10]This is my friend.
[65:15.70]This is my friend crew.
[65:39.78]You scared the chicken, man.
[65:40.91]Come on.
[65:41.45]I'm just realizing... Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[65:44.25]That tutorial mission made me threaten resignation from Twitch.
[66:04.75]Like I'm out of here!
[66:06.53]I'm never streaming again!
[66:07.95]What are we even saying here?
[66:29.51]Let us talk of more pleasant things.
[66:31.73]My words exactly.
[66:33.39]Do you do that all the time?
[66:34.89]Deutsch has gone too far.
[66:35.91]No, I don't.
[66:36.97]Wenceslas is our rightful king.
[66:39.01]Alright, so what now?
[66:39.67]Deutsch is an idiot.
[66:41.55]What can you do?
[66:42.07]Are we going to do a 4v4?
[66:43.29]Deutsch deserves to be taught a lesson.
[66:46.61]Oh, no, no, no.
[66:47.43]Are you guys going to fight him?
[66:48.47]Because I'm not.
[66:49.27]You should give him a proper hiding.
[66:52.77]See how weak I am?
[66:53.53]Do you want to end up in the pillory?
[66:55.90]Don't listen to Fred.
[66:57.48]I've got a better idea.
[66:59.50]Daddy said no fighting.
[67:00.20]I'm gonna be such a good boy because I don't want to have any problems.
[67:18.18]Okay, what do we got?
[67:20.58]We can... Oh, I got dragged in.
[67:21.94]Should I be a good boy or am I going to lose?
[67:23.56]Here comes the first major decision.
[67:44.12]Throw shit at people or be a good boy and not have to use any unarmed melee combat.
[67:49.89]So it doesn't push me to deleting my Twitch channel.
[67:55.41]Oh, which one?
[67:56.11]I don't know.
[68:17.51]I don't know.
[68:18.33]I don't know if I have a decision here, guys.
[68:20.47]I don't think I know what to do.
[68:23.40]Wells Fargo has... You know what I mean?
[68:27.46]I just don't know.
[68:29.20]Do I be a good boy or do I be a bad boy?
[68:32.48]The decision is so intense to me.
[68:35.18]I don't want to cause any problems for anybody.
[68:36.92]But at the same time, I mean, like,
[68:53.27]I think I'm gonna do it!
[68:57.50]I'll do it!
[69:04.82]Whatcha gonna do?
[69:07.64]Man of the bone!
[69:09.50]Let's go do some mischief!
[69:22.16]Come on, do it!
[69:23.18]Oh, yeah!
[69:23.92]I can't... Alright, turn it on!
[69:25.22]Alright, here we go.
[69:26.79]What's the plan?
[69:28.67]We got a plan here?
[69:54.37]Where did the audio go?
[69:58.97]Combat.
[70:06.78]Quality humor.
[70:09.90]I need to pay attention to this.
[70:13.42]Disgusted.
[70:13.72]What do I have to do?
[70:14.60]I fucking didn't pay any attention.
[70:18.20]God damn it.
[70:20.39]Okay, lure the wife away.
[70:27.05]Is this the wife?
[70:30.42]How do I lure the... No, she's just on her medieval iPad.
[70:38.74]Okay, we need to... Lure Dutch's wife away.
[70:45.94]What?
[70:47.48]Where?
[70:47.68]Where?
[70:48.86]Where?
[70:51.46]Oh, over here.
[70:53.42]Hey.
[70:58.93]Your husband's making trouble.
[70:59.99]Yeah, before he does anything dumb.
[71:01.67]Oh, I need to turn the game up now.
[71:23.95]There you go.
[71:25.93]Can't hear a single thing from the game.
[71:33.61]Okay, the wife has been lured away.
[71:35.29]I just like tackled her.
[71:37.99]Alright.
[71:39.95]We're all hungry apparently.
[71:41.11]Alright, let's go.
[71:43.03]She's been lured away.
[71:50.79]Do I get to do this?
[71:54.63]Pick it up with your bare hands?
[71:57.80]What are you waiting for, soldier?
[71:59.98]Fire the trebuchet!
[72:01.84]For king and country!
[72:04.12]Oh my god.
[72:05.24]So this is what they used to do.
[72:07.57]Instead of egging houses, they threw shit at houses.
[72:09.67]Oh my god.
[72:10.49]That's disgusting.
[72:15.05]I just threw it.
[72:16.64]Somebody's recording us, too.
[72:17.88]I'm on video doing this.
[72:20.05]You bastard!
[72:20.83]What the fuck are you... What the fuck do you think you're doing?
[72:24.98]Oh, wait.
[72:26.58]Is this time for... Oh, no.
[72:28.06]Can't you see?
[72:29.32]We're decorating your house for you.
[72:30.98]I don't have to fight him, right?
[72:31.78]It's like your old man was saying in the tavern about that traitor Sigismund.
[72:35.79]We're just doing what we have to do.
[72:39.17]Alright, this is the strong one.
[72:41.11]That's the warrior.
[72:41.87]That's a pretty good shot.
[72:44.37]He's a good throw.
[72:45.11]Oh, no.
[72:45.27]No, no, no.
[72:45.47]Wait, this is combat.
[73:09.45]What if I just back up?
[73:11.09]Oh, God damn it.
[73:14.29]Wait, why do I have to fight two?
[73:18.31]Am I targeting the right person?
[73:24.42]Yeah, we got two on one.
[73:25.96]Alright, I figured out combat.
[73:35.88]Just need to bring another friend.
[73:40.87]That was it.
[73:41.57]That was it.
[73:44.03]Which one?
[73:44.33]Which was the bad guy?
[73:44.93]Ah!
[73:45.01]I was going to punch her.
[73:47.01]I did.
[73:48.47]Wait, what?
[73:48.95]Are we chasing them?
[74:11.70]Why was that so easy?
[74:14.12]And me fighting the other guy was like harder than a Dark Souls boss.
[74:22.37]Is that it?
[74:25.47]Wait, here comes a guard.
[74:28.20]We don't have to run though.
[74:28.90]We can just play it cool.
[74:33.06]Let's just play it cool.
[74:38.80]Huh?
[74:39.26]Run from the... I don't... Hold on, wait, wait.
[74:45.54]I will, uh, what I... Okay.
[74:58.86]Those are not the right people.
[75:00.95]I just, I know, okay.
[75:02.09]I just did the equivalent of like a little kid getting lost in Walmart.
[75:06.36]You know what I mean?
[75:06.78]Like, you think your mom is the same lady.
[75:09.52]You turn, the mom turns around, it's like a different mom.
[75:11.88]They happen to be wearing the same shirt.
[75:16.93]I'm not going to let the king be insulted.
[75:23.71]Deutsch isn't a bad fellow, but he should drop this nonsense about Sigismund before someone touches his ass.
[75:29.45]It's time to delete my account.
[75:32.46]Don't gape like a stuffed squirrel.
[75:35.16]Do you take me for a Jerma, lover?
[75:37.50]I serve my lord, and my lord serves the king, and that's Wenceslas.
[75:43.70]But what to do with you now?
[75:45.95]See, it's going to be fine.
[75:47.73]So I won't go to jail?
[75:52.06]Fuck.
[75:52.44]I've lost it.
[75:53.04]Bang.
[75:53.48]Thing.
[75:53.90]Oh, no, no, no.
[75:54.48]Don't talk to dad.
[75:55.54]I need to eat something.
[75:57.16]I'm gonna die.
[75:57.50]Ugh.
[75:57.58]Okay.
[76:21.81]Don't tell dad.
[76:22.83]Oh my god.
[76:23.55]No.
[76:24.29]Whatever.
[76:24.63]Man, I was about to punch a lady in the face too and then like walk with the group.
[76:28.77]Is this them?
[76:29.17]I can't even tell.
[76:30.21]They all look the same.
[76:31.03]They all wear the same green shirts.
[76:35.68]What's left?
[76:36.26]I got what I have.
[76:37.04]I got the charcoal.
[76:39.10]I already got everything I needed.
[76:40.20]Commission is over.
[76:41.24]Buy ale at the tavern.
[76:42.86]I don't think I have enough money to do that.
[76:44.02]These are... I think I have to do that.
[76:48.04]I didn't get ale for dad.
[76:51.40]So what if I don't have any money?
[76:52.90]What?
[77:00.23]Apples and cheese.
[77:05.37]Do I still have those in my inventory?
[77:15.12]I can't restart it, no.
[77:21.82]She's going to give it to me for free, right?
[77:26.18]I have shit-covered hands.
[77:31.19]A pitcher for father.
[77:32.09]A pitcher for father.
[77:34.37]Mm-hmm.
[77:34.89]No, well, I do my best impression of a bird.
[77:46.09]There it is.
[77:46.49]Thank you.
[77:46.83]Yes, it is.
[77:47.53]Out of the question.
[77:50.87]Out of the question.
[77:51.57]What are they talking... Are they talking about... What's going on here?
[77:55.45]Alright.
[77:55.81]Come on now.
[77:56.90]Interesting.
[78:16.84]I suppose.
[78:18.14]He's a man who makes his coin robbing honest wayfarers.
[78:20.96]I'm sure of it.
[78:22.44]I'll be happy when he's gone for good.
[78:25.33]This is going to be a really fun game.
[78:28.67]He promised to teach me how to use a sword.
[78:30.95]What use would that be to you?
[78:32.65]I'm a swordsman.
[78:34.41]You sound just like father.
[78:36.79]I'll be going now.
[78:38.58]See you this evening.
[78:40.16]I can't believe I didn't wash my hands.
[78:41.46]Is that so?
[78:42.24]Now what would that be?
[78:46.59]Okay.
[78:49.81]I got three schnapps.
[79:01.30]The game auto-saves from time to time at important points in each quest and when you sleep.
[79:06.32]I need to drink... schnapps.
[79:11.34]This is an alcoholic drink you... Alright.
[79:14.60]So that's how you save the game.
[79:18.87]Okay, they all drink in here.
[79:19.81]Do you have, like, food in here I can just eat?
[79:21.93]You probably do.
[79:22.43]It's a... It's a country inn.
[79:24.83]There's gotta be, like, food, right?
[79:26.21]There has to be some kind of food and eats.
[79:28.97]See?
[79:29.85]There's, like, potatoes in here.
[79:30.87]Like, crushed onions.
[79:35.41]I mean, I'm trespassing, apparently.
[79:38.75]This is a lockpick.
[79:39.61]What is... You don't have a lockpick.
[79:40.99]Get out of here, then.
[79:43.65]I can't get any, like, onions?
[79:45.73]Okay, yeah.
[79:46.15]Just take them all.
[79:48.52]Oh, God, that was every onion.
[79:49.69]Oh, God.
[79:52.89]I was never in there.
[79:55.83]I'm walking out with a bag of onions.
[79:58.17]Alright.
[79:59.67]They're gonna know I ate... You know what I mean?
[80:01.26]If I eat an onion right now, somebody walks up to me.
[80:03.12]Hey, what happened to those onions?
[80:04.96]I don't know.
[80:05.30]You're gonna be able to smell my breath from a mile fucking away.
[80:07.96]Alright, let's... Food.
[80:14.69]I got... Okay, I got chicken.
[80:15.43]Chicken.
[80:18.58]How do I eat this?
[80:19.06]Hey, eat.
[80:20.82]Alright, I'm good, right?
[80:27.91]Yeah.
[80:28.05]Alright, all the missions are done, let's go.
[80:36.97]Raw chicken.
[80:42.21]You don't eat raw chicken?
[80:43.63]Back in the old days they did.
[80:46.09]Greetings.
[80:47.25]Greetings.
[80:49.87]No, I don't wanna... We're not doing this right now.
[80:54.91]Back to Dad.
[81:00.28]I'm gonna cook the chicken with onions at home.
[81:01.72]Make sure I'm going the right way.
[81:04.86]Oh no, I need this.
[81:05.58]I need to get the, uh, the hilt or whatever.
[81:13.51]Back in the days, they used to hit a chicken in the head with a club and drag it into their cave and then eat it.
[81:26.78]They also only lived to 30.
[81:27.98]Yeah, we already saw this.
[81:29.40]Came for the guard.
[81:34.44]Thanks for that.
[81:42.08]I'm gonna kick your ass.
[81:44.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[81:48.80]Godspeed.
[81:49.58]Alright.
[81:55.13]Pick up the crossguard, and that's it, right?
[81:58.81]Optional, go back to father.
[82:01.77]I'm not dealing with that guy.
[82:04.49]Okay, dad, here's all the stuff.
[82:06.13]I finally completed the tutorial mission.
[82:10.87]About time.
[82:12.07]Have you got everything I wanted?
[82:13.39]I have.
[82:16.39]I have charcoal, the hilt, and the ale.
[82:18.81]We can start.
[82:19.81]Good job.
[82:20.93]Let's have it then, son.
[82:22.42]I had 30 calories worth of onions.
[82:26.70]Right.
[82:27.82]Let's see what kind of job the master in Sasau did for us.
[82:32.86]A lot of cutscenes.
[82:35.45]Nice.
[82:35.79]Look at that, lad.
[82:40.31]Is that Sean Bean?
[82:42.17]He's in everything.
[82:47.18]One hour and 30 minutes to get through tutorial?
[82:48.62]That's not true.
[82:50.32]Like the first 30 minutes of the stream was like making sure I could stream because Comcast sucks asshole.
[82:55.80]About 51 minutes.
[82:56.20]Can I throw my chicken on there too?
[83:09.88]By the way, someone paid me a call.
[83:13.50]I reckon you might know what it was about.
[83:15.40]Uh-oh.
[83:17.24]Did you throw shit at somebody's ass?
[83:19.56]Really?
[83:21.40]Because I'm pretty sure you and your friends threw dung at Deutsch's freshly whitewashed house.
[83:28.51]He was here with the catchpole earlier, and it was not a friendly visit.
[83:32.97]What got into you, Hal?
[83:34.77]Sorry, Dad.
[83:35.39]They peer pressured me into smoking.
[83:36.49]Nope.
[83:36.59]I'm a rebel.
[83:36.89]Yeah.
[83:37.01]Whatever, Dad.
[84:06.23]Do you understand?
[84:07.99]I understand.
[84:09.87]Good.
[84:11.91]That voice acting is actually pretty good.
[84:13.41]I mean, it's very timely.
[84:16.13]So you think it's right to let traitors speak ill of our king?
[84:19.93]It seems like they paid money.
[84:21.23]The boy gets caught making a fool of himself when he still hasn't learned his lesson.
[84:26.63]So Deutsch spouts rubbish and war.
[84:29.23]You turn into a common thug.
[84:32.97]You might win a fight with violence, but you'll never win an argument.
[84:37.99]Ah, debatable.
[84:39.59]Use your brain.
[84:39.95]This is my first sword.
[84:40.59]This is Henry's first real sword.
[85:03.53]I'll heat it up, and when I take it out, you slip the grip on so it fits exactly.
[85:08.18]You know what you're doing.
[85:09.14]Yeah, I do.
[85:10.64]I've done this before.
[85:11.36]Alright.
[85:22.23]Do it.
[85:24.17]Go on.
[85:27.23]Come on.
[85:29.45]Good.
[85:30.53]Once more.
[85:36.98]That's it.
[85:38.40]Done.
[85:39.40]It's a wooden hilt.
[85:40.46]Now file it down so it sits well in the hand.
[85:42.62]I'll prepare the guard.
[85:44.54]Wouldn't that burn your hands?
[85:45.64]Where are the oven mitts?
[85:50.77]Oh, that's a fine looking blade.
[85:59.43]Father, why did you leave Prague?
[86:01.23]It is a long story.
[86:02.43]Who ever heard of a master swordsmith making horseshoes in a village?
[86:06.92]Fire wasn't hot back then.
[86:08.32]I had my reasons, Hal.
[86:11.26]And here, I have your mother and you.
[86:12.74]Why would I want any other life?
[86:15.83]Do you remember Emperor Charles?
[86:17.37]How old was the main character supposed to be?
[86:18.71]I have no idea.
[86:19.49]Probably like late teens, early twenties, something like that.
[86:23.67]He built half of Prague, a score of castles, had a bridge made over the Moldau, and founded a university.
[86:30.89]And all without a war.
[86:32.69]He knew how to rule.
[86:53.61]Hold on.
[86:56.59]God damn it.
[86:59.07]Come on, where is it?
[87:01.04]Don't make me take too much time to find this.
[87:13.76]It's too late.
[87:15.26]No, I have to do this.
[87:16.10]I have to.
[87:29.40]I need to find the right image.
[87:31.80]Oh, fuck it, whatever.
[87:32.60]I was going to put a picture of a firefighter next to this guy when it zooms in on me.
[87:35.50]They're wearing the same exact fucking outfit.
[87:37.78]Who cares?
[87:47.61]Tactical joke.
[87:48.55]I was going to flash it for a second.
[87:52.13]Someone who's like is born only once a thousand years.
[87:55.61]It's closing the tab.
[87:56.39]What about Sigismund?
[87:59.83]Be careful.
[88:00.29]I see a character and I don't know who it is.
[88:02.48]I gotta think.
[88:02.90]Is it the Gordon's Fisherman?
[88:06.72]No, who is it?
[88:07.20]Does Gordon's Fisherman have a fucking red hat?
[88:25.18]No, this is like Fireflower Mario, Gorton's fisherman and a fireman together in the same character.
[88:34.38]Paddington Bear.
[88:35.60]Yes, that, okay, there it is.
[88:38.49]It's Paddington Bear, but he turned into a person.
[88:44.11]It's magnificent.
[88:46.01]Indeed it is.
[88:47.91]The Lord be with you.
[88:49.21]My father sent me for those nails.
[88:51.94]Good day to you, Teresa.
[88:53.82]They're ready.
[88:54.92]Will you fetch them for me, Hal?
[88:56.46]They're in the trunk in the living room.
[88:58.08]Oh, thank God I got control of the character.
[89:00.32]Henry, are you alright?
[89:01.54]Where's the sword?
[89:03.88]Go back to Father at the Forge.
[89:05.96]Go and get the nails.
[89:09.32]Where though?
[89:10.88]Over here.
[89:12.04]I know what's going to happen here.
[89:13.64]So I'm going to go get the nails, I'm going to turn around and come back and there's going to be a big commotion here.
[89:16.82]They're going to grab father and they're going to be... They're going to get killed or something.
[89:22.63]There's nothing I can do about it.
[89:23.69]Alright, I'm not hungry anymore.
[89:28.43]That's good.
[89:31.39]Are those the nails?
[89:31.87]Yes.
[89:37.05]That's what's going to happen, right?
[89:38.69]And that's how you deter your... What is that?
[89:40.87]I want the sack of nails.
[89:43.83]Pick up the cream cheese.
[89:48.97]That's what happens in every single one of these.
[89:52.02]Carrots?
[89:53.44]How can I steal from my own house?
[89:57.64]I'm taking all of my family's food.
[90:00.20]But isn't it mine?
[90:00.96]Now I can make a pretty good sandwich.
[90:10.56]Is it really stealing?
[90:15.71]What is this?
[90:16.17]Cabbage?
[90:18.93]Carrots?
[90:20.57]I can make a feast!
[90:25.53]Alright, where the hell is the, um... What am I looking for?
[90:32.70]Was it actually on the table and I just didn't grab it?
[90:34.72]Or what?
[90:35.30]Over here?
[90:37.40]Uh, there are the nails...
[90:42.29]Okay.
[90:45.03]Overburdened?
[90:45.49]That's fine.
[90:45.79]I'll just sell them.
[90:48.93]Here it comes.
[90:53.09]Here are the nails.
[90:55.69]Is it really stealing if you steal from your parents?
[90:58.59]I guess so.
[91:00.19]Yes, absolutely.
[91:07.63]Maybe we'll see each other there.
[91:09.59]That's a health potion?
[91:10.43]Okay.
[91:10.89]I'll be on my way.
[91:12.23]That sword is truly beautiful.
[91:23.92]What the fuck?
[91:24.68]What do you think, Paddington Bear?
[91:26.16]Now, stop staring at her and come and see this.
[91:29.00]She has a big dress on!
[91:37.84]This is where I test the weapon.
[91:39.42]Watch it be dull.
[91:42.02]Watch it, Dad.
[91:42.86]Jesus.
[91:43.71]Watch your backswing.
[91:44.81]Told you.
[91:46.95]Here he comes.
[91:48.81]He's gonna swing and cut him.
[91:50.15]See?
[91:51.53]Here he comes.
[92:07.42]He's going to do it to the dad instead.
[92:13.44]Would you like to try it?
[92:14.80]Yeah.
[92:15.24]What good is a sword to a commoner?
[92:17.70]Don't call me a commoner.
[92:18.84]I thought I came from a loyal royal family.
[92:23.06]Hey, this is just me.
[92:29.02]They're making fun of me.
[92:30.66]You still have a lot to learn.
[92:32.86]Ask your father to show you how.
[92:34.40]He knows what he's about.
[92:35.66]Learning his trade will serve him better in life, sir.
[92:39.36]Perhaps.
[92:41.68]That's just the stream you've been watching for the last hour and a half.
[92:45.13]I see that you almost have it finished.
[92:46.97]It just needs a polish, then Henry will bring it to you.
[92:50.11]Excellent.
[92:51.08]Fine work.
[92:51.90]Very fine.
[92:53.56]What about Davy Crockett over there?
[92:56.52]What say you, sir, Eastman?
[92:58.04]True, Sir Radzik.
[92:59.54]If I'd have had its like back in Nicopolis, things would have worked out differently.
[93:03.25]Okay, it's not a gun.
[93:05.17]How odd to find such... Fucking, what an idiot.
[93:07.99]He thinks that's a rifle.
[93:10.27]Stupid moron.
[93:10.77]A man of his talent would have no problem making a fortune in Prague or Vienna.
[93:14.79]You're right.
[93:16.24]It's a very long and peculiar story.
[93:20.01]I'd be glad to listen to it over a cup of wine, but duty calls and I must leave.
[93:26.32]Here you are.
[93:27.86]No, bye.
[93:29.72]Learn from your father.
[93:31.56]He truly is a master of his craft.
[93:33.40]Why does this guy have locks all over his shirt?
[93:35.68]Aren't those heavy?
[93:37.18]He has padlocks all over him.
[93:39.92]What a real pain to take off your clothes.
[93:42.84]You can still slip it out above you.
[93:45.59]What is that protecting you from?
[93:53.29]See?
[93:53.51]He looks great.
[93:53.96]Give me that sword, please.
[93:55.44]Yeah.
[93:55.66]Aye.
[93:55.82]Aye.
[94:23.42]He's telling me to pick Dexterity and Agility.
[94:44.70]He's surprised I haven't skipped the cutscene.
[94:46.91]I told you we were going to play the game.
[94:49.25]We got past my absolute meltdown already.
[94:51.53]That's not going to happen again.
[94:52.55]I had a meltdown like an hour ago.
[94:53.41]Like the seven stages of a Jeremy stream.
[94:56.25]Denial.
[94:56.77]Meltdown.
[95:13.29]Anger.
[95:14.47]Acceptance.
[95:16.11]Revitalization.
[95:18.53]Perfection.
[95:18.97]Oh, here we go.
[95:22.25]This is where it happens.
[95:31.06]This is the beginning of the game.
[95:32.52]They're ransacking the whole countryside.
[95:36.02]Oh, no.
[95:36.38]It's King... What king is that?
[95:41.20]There are a lot of flags there.
[95:54.31]Those are all just different cryptocurrencies.
[95:56.73]They're here to take us all over.
[96:00.01]Which one of them is going to be the one that's worth buying?
[96:03.61]God damn it.
[96:12.00]Okay.
[96:15.24]Don't worry about me.
[96:19.85]I'm gonna die real quick here.
[96:21.71]In about five minutes.
[96:24.41]And I will absolutely die on camera.
[96:26.79]I forgot what he told me to do.
[96:28.66]What did he want me to do?
[96:30.68]Pfft.
[96:39.76]Alright, so get to the castle with your sword.
[96:41.24]Uh-oh.
[96:49.09]They have horses.
[96:49.79]Here we go.
[96:56.99]No.
[96:59.42]So the whole beginning of the... This is just fable.
[97:03.56]This is how that game starts.
[97:05.44]You go around, you fucking chicken chaser, you're stupid, get me three gold pieces, and then the whole place gets ransacked and the game starts.
[97:22.42]No, this didn't happen, though.
[97:28.88]Come on, what... What do you think you're gonna do here?
[97:31.88]The whole place is... Everything's on fire, what are you gonna do?
[97:41.99]Almost we're almost there son not much further We're gonna make it not if I have anything to say about it, I'll shoot you in my true sight arrow Right in front of your fucking son Dad They're gonna zoom in he's gonna laugh
[98:13.53]Oh, he just whacked him in the butt.
[98:15.37]He got him with the flat side.
[98:23.50]He didn't even stab him.
[98:32.26]They just pretend stabbing her.
[98:33.70]This is just an act.
[98:40.09]And then I wake up.
[98:45.71]Oh shit, it's King Mr. Clean.
[98:57.05]It's Comcast.
[99:04.56]Bald, bald, bald.
[99:08.82]Yeah, bald coin.
[99:13.30]What?
[99:13.84]Let me in there!
[99:14.46]Don't just draw the bridge.
[99:15.76]They're just telling me to jump off of the cliff.
[99:22.52]Oh no.
[99:23.90]That would be a pretty good death sound.
[99:32.53]You know what?
[99:34.43]Uh... What?
[99:36.37]More game developers need to do that.
[99:38.63]Use sneezes for death sounds.
[99:40.17]That could be like the stab.
[99:42.35]Try that.
[99:42.87]Use it somewhere.
[99:43.91]Alright, so I have the sword.
[99:46.27]You see all your equipment with detailed descriptions.
[99:48.05]You can change the outfit.
[99:50.79]Okay, hold on.
[99:51.33]Here it comes again.
[99:51.95]Just imagine like I'm gonna get stabbed like in the chest.
[99:53.62]You know what I'm saying?
[99:58.40]Here comes the guy on the horse.
[99:59.40]No.
[99:59.66]God damn it.
[100:00.22]I lost the sneeze.
[100:01.36]Alright.
[100:02.44]All the weapons, quest items.
[100:05.52]Equip.
[100:08.00]Can't use this quest item.
[100:09.38]Why the hell can't I not use this?
[100:13.69]Where am I supposed to go?
[100:15.95]What just happened to me?
[100:17.73]Who the fuck is this?
[100:19.65]Run.
[100:19.95]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[100:21.39]I'm going to lose him down the rocks.
[100:31.80]I gotta get a horse?
[100:38.55]I'm not going the right way here.
[100:40.37]I'm kind of going a really stupid way.
[100:42.45]At least I lost him.
[100:44.79]Ah, he's gone.
[100:46.03]Okay.
[100:47.75]Um... I'm gonna laugh my ass off if he just falls down from here.
[100:59.00]There he is!
[101:02.01]Right, sneak.
[101:02.47]Okay, horse riding.
[101:11.44]Oh no.
[101:12.82]Trot at the horse's basic pace.
[101:14.18]Calf's walk gives your horse a chance to recover.
[101:20.02]Faster pace with the horse's endurance.
[101:23.08]W and left shift double tap as gallop is the fastest, but it will soon deplete your horse's stamina.
[101:30.55]Your horse is smarter than some people.
[101:34.87]And we'll stick to the path you're on if you give him his hand.
[101:37.53]His head.
[101:39.44]Just begin cantering and don't steer him.
[101:42.58]Okay.
[101:44.94]That's his stamina.
[101:52.48]Oh my god!
[102:05.26]Do I have an axe in me?
[102:08.60]Alright, hold on.
[102:09.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[102:12.70]Why am I sneaking?
[102:13.74]I don't know.
[102:14.20]There's nobody around me.
[102:21.15]Just follow the path.
[102:22.45]I don't have a sword.
[102:25.43]I do have a sword.
[102:27.91]Okay.
[102:29.25]Well, never mind.
[102:32.87]I unequipped it.
[102:34.49]Wow, what a moron.
[102:37.57]Some horses are smarter than people.
[102:39.87]Yeah.
[102:40.65]Yeah, there.
[102:44.47]We were told that already.
[102:51.97]Save the girl.
[102:57.61]Where?
[103:00.28]Where's her girl?
[103:03.85]Horse riding, yeah.
[103:06.06]No, they're over here.
[103:06.62]Okay, hold on, I'll get this.
[103:07.44]Right in the head.
[103:18.06]I don't think I was supposed to do this.
[103:22.29]Get on the horse!
[103:34.25]X!
[103:42.10]Okay... Oh shit!
[103:54.88]Can I get... Get on the horse!
[103:57.18]Back up over the gate!
[104:05.74]What the fuck is happening?
[104:11.56]Okay, so I can't save that lady.
[104:17.63]Save her then run.
[104:18.47]No, here's what I'm going to do.
[104:19.25]I'm going to get on the horse and run over them and then keep going.
[104:28.71]I can't fight three or four people.
[104:30.06]I can't fight like seven people at the same time.
[104:31.90]You guys really think I'm capable of something like that?
[104:37.28]Punch, then run.
[104:38.49]I need to be able to get the horse out of the stables.
[104:40.55]Okay, they're all going to be coming down here.
[104:47.99]Do not engage in combat system.
[104:50.41]Honestly, I know.
[104:56.21]Okay, I need stamina.
[104:58.95]I'm going to ride.
[105:02.30]Punch and run.
[105:03.24]That's a good idea.
[105:03.80]Okay, we're just going to canter.
[105:07.67]Okay, here we go.
[105:09.91]Break it up and then run.
[105:13.31]Uh-huh.
[105:14.21]Wait.
[105:17.53]What happened?
[105:18.45]Oh, fucking come on now!
[105:23.73]This way!
[105:24.67]Over here now, Mr. Horse.
[105:26.39]I saved the girl!
[105:27.17]Oh god, give me a fucking break.
[105:29.31]I whistled.
[105:31.27]Oh my fucking god, no.
[105:38.45]I need the horse, like, right now.
[105:43.31]I'm gonna die again.
[105:44.41]Because of that shit.
[105:45.41]I really am.
[105:46.53]I'm actually gonna fucking die again.
[106:05.62]You... I don't care about this lady.
[106:09.71]This is... It's not physically possible to fight these guys.
[106:14.77]You can surround... There's ten people here.
[106:16.47]And I die in one or two hits.
[106:20.02]No fucking way.
[106:20.82]I'm riding by.
[106:21.76]I don't care.
[106:31.11]Everybody wants me to, like, stop the fight.
[106:32.75]Stop!
[106:33.01]Hey, get off and fucking yell at them and then run!
[106:35.33]No!
[106:36.55]No fucking way!
[106:37.45]Alright, here we go.
[106:57.68]Ready?
[107:04.54]Saved her!
[107:07.38]Get out of the fucking way!
[107:12.69]See, she's saved.
[107:16.95]Alright, see you later.
[107:25.51]Objective complete.
[107:31.22]Don't look back.
[107:34.99]You guys want me to get off the fucking horses and die over and over again?
[107:40.64]Of course I'm gonna save her.
[107:54.67]Oh my god, no.
[107:55.55]Bleeding the wound must be bandaged.
[107:57.01]You have to get to somebody quickly, that'll help you.
[108:02.89]Is somebody behind me?
[108:04.91]Of course there is.
[108:12.12]What the fuck?
[108:16.20]I gotta get somewhere in a hurry.
[108:20.44]I guess we're going this way.
[108:24.90]Left?
[108:25.72]Who the fuck are these people?

[109:30.24]I can't beat the tutorial, it just is- I just- I- I have no- I have no excuse.
[109:34.58]This is just not the kind of game I play.
[109:36.22]It just isn't.
[109:40.20]I would- You would literally never find me playing this game in like a hundred years.
[109:43.55]Why am I playing this?
[109:44.19]I don't understand.
[109:48.61]Why?
[109:49.41]Why am I playing this game?
[109:50.79]Who told me to play this?
[110:03.16]Alright, let's go.
[110:03.86]Good.
[110:04.06]Okay, skip.
[110:04.62]Skip it.
[110:05.54]Okay, move.
[110:06.22]Alright, go.
[110:07.32]Gallop.
[110:07.62]Alright, hold on a second.
[110:16.13]So, I need to go just here.
[110:18.81]Just go to A. Ride to Talenberg.
[110:21.67]That's it.
[110:24.18]What the fuck, man?
[110:25.44]Why did that have to happen?
[110:26.92]What the fuck just happened?
[110:28.14]Why did my character turn around?
[110:30.84]Why did I turn around because I opened the menu?
[110:33.24]What?
[110:33.94]Why?
[110:34.24]You guys saw that.
[110:37.62]What the fuck was that?
[110:57.21]What does this want me to do?
[110:59.63]Fast travel... Alright, wait a minute.
[111:04.81]The horse moves in the menu?
[111:09.47]Where does this want me to go?
[111:13.12]Because this doesn't like dying, right?
[111:20.52]Like over here.
[111:23.89]Just go to the A. Oh my fucking god.
[111:26.49]That is horse... That is absolute dog shit.
[111:31.27]Like, it's turning me around in a circle when I fucking hit the menu button.
[111:33.69]I don't even know what... I'm gonna die again.
[111:37.34]Like, I'm actually gonna die again.
[111:42.48]I have to go, like, this way.
[111:43.60]Like, it... Good, maybe I'll be turned around.
[111:52.51]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[111:53.99]I have to go to the left.
[112:06.71]Go.
[112:07.23]Please.
[112:18.54]How am I turning my... What's wrong with the horse?
[112:20.74]Slow down.
[112:21.93]Why are they behind me right here?
[112:24.35]What the fuck is happening?
[112:26.37]Why?
[112:28.31]They're just taunting me.
[112:29.77]It's fucking Slender Man.
[112:46.22]Why wouldn't they be behind me?
[112:47.57]Why are they going at the same pace that I am?
[112:49.29]They're like, they're slowly walking.
[113:03.35]Some horses are smarter than people.
[113:09.00]I guess.
[113:11.16]We're just in meltdown phase this whole stream.
[113:14.90]Are these... I don't even know who these people are.
[113:16.58]Get out of the way.
[113:31.95]How much longer do I have to be on this road for?
[113:33.67]I did it.
[113:51.56]Oh my god.
[113:56.37]Give me a break.
[114:06.03]Don't open the map.
[114:07.95]I did save the girl, I went... Boop!
[114:35.10]Alright.
[115:00.06]Yeah, I whistled and it said it was over.
[115:08.79]Someone give him a drink and bring hot wine and bandages.
[115:13.23]I need, can I get those in real life too?
[115:23.77]Tell me boy, who are you and where are you from?
[115:27.37]What in hell's name happened?
[115:30.21]I've come from the Scallets.
[115:32.39]They burned it to the ground, slaughtered everyone.
[115:35.55]Who, who burned it to the ground?
[115:37.15]A huge army.
[115:39.35]They attacked without warning.
[115:41.31]And they weren't Czechs or Germans either.
[115:43.43]Who then?
[115:43.93]I don't know.
[115:44.65]He got past the hardest part of the game?
[115:46.67]Or heard their language.
[115:48.34]Are you for real?
[115:56.08]Tartars, you say?
[115:57.86]Well, we'll deal with that later.
[116:00.16]First, let's have a look at that leg of yours.
[116:04.97]Yes?
[116:08.21]Good your teeth, boy.
[116:09.93]I'm going to pull that arrow out.
[116:10.89]He's going to pull my hair out.
[116:15.03]Oh, man.
[116:15.57]He just pulled out a bunch of my fucking hair.
[116:25.33]Easy.
[116:27.87]All done.
[116:29.45]You were lucky, lad.
[116:30.88]The arrow missed the bone.
[116:31.94]He balded me.
[116:33.70]It only needed bandaging, and I've done that all day.
[116:35.96]I want everybody to have the same hairline as me in my kingdom.
[116:39.64]We take the first four inches.
[116:40.86]I hope I can.
[117:14.77]Oh, it's just me.
[117:16.27]Thank you, me.
[117:17.79]This is a survivor from... Yes, it's me with different facial hair.
[117:21.41]Tell me, boy, what exactly happened?
[117:24.45]Did you see the insides of the attackers?
[117:27.12]Were there any more survivors?
[117:28.30]That voice doesn't really match that face.
[117:31.28]I don't know what army it was, but it was huge.
[117:34.84]There were dozens of banners flying on the hill above Skalitz
[117:38.77]The ones who did the slaughtering spoke a strange language.
[117:43.69]They burned scallops to the ground.
[117:46.17]But a lot of people took refuge in the castle.
[117:48.82]Put on a face can.
[117:49.64]I'm in a bathrobe right now.
[117:51.84]And as I fled, they shouted from the battlements that I should come and warn you.
[117:56.42]The soldiers the boy didn't recognize, they could be those Cumans of Sigismund's.
[118:01.78]It said they came to Hungary from the east, and now they're the core of his army.
[118:06.18]Sacking Kutenberg.
[118:07.92]Must have given him a taste for stolen silver.
[118:11.04]Skanos is a small castle, sir.
[118:14.03]Put it on now.
[118:15.25]I got like slicked back hair and a bathrobe on.
[118:20.29]An R-small garrison would be no help.
[118:23.27]Even if we could risk sending them.
[118:25.23]You think we're next in line?
[118:27.34]Maybe.
[118:27.54]Maybe.
[118:30.95]No, I'm not... I... Prove it.
[118:36.67]Let me prove... Why do I have to prove this?
[118:39.93]You guys... I really am just like an angry old man screaming at a fucking screen.
[118:46.26]I don't think I can turn the camera on.
[118:49.22]Fine.
[119:01.53]Make sure this isn't going to fucking show anything fucked up.
[119:07.78]I will prove it to the one person in chat that wanted me to prove it.
[119:17.92]There.
[119:19.10]I mean, it's really, really... Hold on a second.
[119:22.58]I look like I belong in this game.
[119:26.72]Hold on here.
[119:30.28]There.
[119:31.80]Let me just change this so you can see.
[119:39.06]See?
[119:41.14]I'm in a goddamn bathrobe!
[119:43.37]You thought it was a joke!
[119:45.67]It's not a joke!
[119:48.19]See, I'm not gonna stand up that far because it's like a short skirt.
[119:53.75]This is what I do!
[119:54.53]I fucking play these games in my ba- I'm really just an old man.
[119:59.79]that just yells at the screen.
[120:01.13]Jabroni?
[120:01.61]I'm not allowed to be in a bathrobe in my own damn house?
[120:04.56]Evil Peter Parker?
[120:30.12]The CRT TV makes it funnier.
[120:32.97]That sh- I- That thing ha- Okay, game saved.
[120:37.35]Talk to Sir Robard.
[120:40.13]Is that him?
[120:43.33]There he is.
[120:44.99]Alright, level of health also determines maximum level of stamina.
[120:47.97]Heal yourself.
[120:50.90]Okay.
[120:51.16]I need to heal myself?
[120:51.74]Food?
[120:58.99]Cabbage, I don't have some, um... Yeah, right here, right?
[121:05.48]Apply.
[121:08.18]What?
[121:13.88]I don't, I don't, can I... Okay, I just ate a cabbage.
[121:22.67]I just have a poor quality arrow.
[121:29.05]Eat the arrows.
[121:31.47]Okay, door keys.
[121:32.42]Didn't somebody tell me that I had health potions?
[121:35.84]That those are health potions?
[121:37.34]These things right here?
[121:38.46]Yeah, within one minute will cure light wounds or dispel hangover effects.
[121:48.42]Okay, there you go.
[121:51.60]Why do I have so many apples?
[121:53.28]I don't know.
[121:53.82]What?
[121:54.00]Don't fuck around now.
[121:55.48]Not a good time.
[121:55.84]We're going to get an upside down pretzel?
[122:17.31]It is a generous man and a good one.
[122:19.53]We'll take care of it.
[122:20.19]I'll have to get something to eat.
[122:21.53]I'm starting to get hungry.
[122:22.39]You risked your life to warn us, and we won't forget it.
[122:24.93]Alright, so sit down here and get a meal.
[122:27.02]Are they going to deliver it to me?
[122:33.20]Excuse me.
[122:34.90]Oh, no, go to the upside-down pretzel.
[122:39.13]Damn.
[122:40.73]You learned kitchens.
[122:43.09]Ah, milady.
[122:45.37]You're fortunate our good lady Stephanie of Talmberg has graced us with her presence.
[122:49.81]My lady, I'm honored.
[122:51.27]So this is our brave young man?
[122:53.81]Welcome, lad.
[122:55.27]Bojana here will take care of you.
[122:57.61]No doubt you're tired and hungry.
[122:59.71]Indeed.
[123:00.25]How could he not be, poor soul?
[123:02.64]After everything he's been through... Why do I care about the orientation of my food?
[123:06.38]There, aren't you?
[123:07.84]That was an... That pretzel was upside down.
[123:09.78]Here you are, then.
[123:12.84]Eat your fill.
[123:14.20]What's in that?
[123:15.18]I'm gluten-free.
[123:16.92]I'm allergic to a couple of different vegetables and proteins.
[123:19.98]I'm not sure I can eat that.
[123:23.76]Young Henry here is overwhelmed by your generosity.
[123:26.14]Yes, yes.
[123:26.46]Thank you, my lady.
[123:27.64]May God reward you for your kindness.
[123:43.98]Eat up now.
[123:45.58]You're incapable, Han, so... I'm incapable?
[123:48.15]No, now... Fuck you.
[123:50.49]Now my stream's telling me that, now you're telling me that?
[123:53.31]You don't think I understand that already?
[123:54.49]You don't think I'm having trouble with this game already as it is, and all the things I need to learn?
[123:58.43]I'm incapable.
[123:59.31]Thanks a lot, lady.
[124:00.02]...the bedchamber of the courtyard lodge.
[124:02.52]And don't forget to take off those filthy boots before getting into bed.
[124:16.72]Go to the kitchen.
[124:17.40]Okay, eat the food.
[124:18.65]The longer Henry doesn't eat, the weaker he gets.
[124:23.11]If he fasts long enough, he can die.
[124:25.11]Okay.
[124:31.89]Am I stealing this?
[124:36.93]Nope.
[124:37.27]Okay, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[124:46.70]Is this for everybody, or is this just for me?
[124:51.14]Why am I... What's wrong with my eyes?
[124:52.36]I clearly only... Um... Something bad happened.
[124:57.98]Alright, now let's eat.
[124:59.67]Let's eat the fuck out of it, right?
[125:18.55]What do you mean rude?
[125:20.46]Hey, excuse me.
[125:23.24]Let me help you here.
[125:26.24]You're really fucking this whole thing up.
[125:32.62]You don't have enough wine in there.
[125:38.75]Hey!
[125:42.61]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[125:43.51]Put it... Cook item.
[125:45.70]There we go.
[125:46.16]Chicken.
[125:46.32]Chicken.
[125:50.92]Got a cooked chicken.
[125:51.68]50 apples.
[125:56.06]I love how it says deal with the fire.
[126:00.39]Can I have a bite?
[126:04.55]Can you throw?
[126:05.03]Alright, I've eaten.
[126:07.31]What's next on the list?
[126:11.35]Oh, you mean unsheathe my weapon and... Okay, I just didn't know.
[126:19.22]Uh, we got...
[126:21.36]What's next?
[126:22.24]Go to the courtyard lodge and sleep until morning.
[126:25.75]Which is... out here.
[126:27.97]A lot of question marks.
[126:35.98]Is it in where I just was?
[126:40.14]I guess it's in here.
[126:43.72]Do I have an outside room, like a motel?
[126:45.40]Or is it an inside room, like a hotel?
[126:50.32]That's a lockpick.
[126:51.40]I probably could have just walked.
[126:52.26]It probably was just inside of where I just was.
[126:56.99]Now I'm just walking in a circle.
[126:59.75]Yeah.
[127:01.01]I'm just walking in a circle right now.
[127:02.47]Fucking horses are smarter than people.
[127:06.37]Now we're going upstairs.
[127:07.07]I have no idea where I'm going now.
[127:13.17]Now we're up in the stables.
[127:15.39]This is somebody's private area.
[127:22.88]Um, nothing.
[127:24.78]Bye.
[127:26.84]Okay, we made it back to where we were.
[127:28.46]I circled around completely 100% circle.
[127:34.34]Who's this guy?
[127:35.78]This is my room.
[127:40.23]Alright, go to bed.
[127:42.19]If you're tired, your stamina will eloquently decrease.
[127:45.93]Sleep is the solution.
[127:47.05]Find an available bed, which you'll recognize from the icon in the compass.
[127:51.14]yep sit on it to launch sleep okay sleep um comfort nourishment energy alright we need to get to 100 energy
[128:14.25]You can't sleep any longer.
[128:15.39]That's how long I sleep every day.
[128:17.31]At least like 12 to 25 hours.
[128:18.51]12 to 20 hours.
[128:18.95]I need food, though.
[128:26.90]What happened to my comfort?
[128:28.76]It was just 100%.
[128:32.40]Okay, that's fine.
[128:33.52]Alright, right here.
[128:34.24]7 hours.
[128:34.98]Start.
[128:40.21]I'm gonna die in my sleep.
[128:45.52]Today the patrols will be doubled.
[128:47.66]Keep your eyes peeled.
[128:49.24]If you see anything out of the ordinary, report it immediately.
[128:53.22]Understood.
[128:54.32]Yes, sir.
[128:55.14]I wish I could.
[128:55.72]I don't sleep for 12 hours a night, guys.
[128:57.60]It was a joke.
[129:03.38]Yes?
[129:06.78]It is I, Henry.
[129:08.80]Forgive the intrusion.
[129:09.90]It is I. I didn't wake you, boy.
[129:12.77]Shoes on.
[129:14.47]My lady...
[129:19.19]No, no, not at all.
[129:22.51]But what brings you here at this hour?
[129:24.05]I thought you could do with a little wine.
[129:31.60]It's just what you need to help you sleep.
[129:35.64]My lady, thank you.
[129:40.10]You really shouldn't.
[129:42.30]You could have sent a servant.
[129:43.62]I want one of these mugs.
[129:44.52]I was going to.
[129:46.20]Let me nudity warning.
[129:46.86]Okay, thank you.
[129:47.56]Thank you kindly.
[129:48.00]Okay, what are you guys talking about?
[130:10.57]Now, Henry, I know this is all very new and strange for you.
[130:19.41]But I want you to feel at home here.
[130:22.27]You're not to worry about anything that's getting better.
[130:26.73]God knows you've been through a terrible ordeal.
[130:32.43]I know what it is to be left alone in the world.
[130:36.15]Although your loss is much greater.
[130:40.07]But with God's help, the pain will ease in time.
[130:43.91]I'm not going to knock her out.
[130:47.51]What the fuck?
[130:49.01]If you feel like it.
[130:53.21]Alright.
[130:56.06]Is it time?
[130:57.22]Is it time for me to play this game?
[131:00.52]I want to play this game.
[131:03.40]Tell the story.
[131:04.18]I ain't talking about it.
[131:05.20]Move on.
[131:08.24]Everyone close to me died there.
[131:11.79]Good.
[131:12.27]Glad we got to skip that whole thing.
[131:13.39]I'm sorry about what befell you.
[131:17.35]What the fuck?
[131:19.25]What the fuck is that noise?
[131:21.25]And those who managed to take cover are still alive.
[131:23.39]There's an animal on my wall.
[131:27.41]I'm not even kidding.
[131:28.31]There was a bunch of scratches and an animal back here.
[131:31.50]No one can do anything against such an army.
[131:34.86]The king is in captivity.
[131:37.18]And the nobility at each other's throats.
[131:40.88]What is to become of us?
[131:44.88]God alone knows.
[131:47.90]No, that wasn't a snake.
[131:49.36]That was probably a rat.
[131:50.18]God alone knows.
[131:53.19]It was scary, though, regardless.
[131:57.51]Why are people scared of mice and rats?
[131:59.13]It's late.
[132:00.19]You must be tired.
[132:03.75]Wait, leave one of those KFC biscuits, please.
[132:06.77]Good night, Mom.
[132:08.14]Everything has to be KFC.
[132:09.74]Because I ate it yesterday.
[132:14.47]Did he say goodnight, mum?
[132:16.97]Goodnight, mum.
[132:17.75]I don't know.
[132:22.19]They carry disease.
[132:23.27]No they don't.
[132:25.92]What diseases does a North American rat carry?
[132:31.02]The cold?
[132:31.74]The flu?
[132:34.50]What diseases do they carry?
[132:41.32]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[132:42.24]A plague has not existed in like 900 years Henry help us what he's he's alive.
[133:07.29]Oh
[133:12.36]Holy shit.
[133:15.88]That was kind of deep, Dad.
[133:16.82]Those are your dying words?
[133:17.51]Okay, can I fight somebody?
[133:18.59]I need to, like, learn how to fight.
[133:20.47]I need combat.
[133:20.95]I need to actually be shown how to fight and where to fight.
[133:24.17]Go to the battlements.
[133:43.72]Is somebody in my room asleep?
[133:48.62]What the fuck is happening?
[133:52.48]Alright, I was sleepwalking.
[133:55.88]I need to put the torch on.
[134:01.87]Torch.
[134:04.85]Okay.
[134:09.71]Where's the torch?
[134:10.45]Alright, I got the torch in my hand right now.
[134:15.56]Alright, go to the battlements.
[134:29.45]What happened?
[134:30.87]Go to the battlements via the gateway stairs.
[134:36.79]Go.
[134:38.65]What am I doing here?
[134:39.37]Did I go the right way?
[134:40.47]Did I go the right way?
[134:43.31]I'm on the battlements right now.
[134:44.47]Where's Sir Rodrik?
[134:51.64]Yeah, there he is.
[134:53.90]He really is wearing the same... He's wearing the same shit as me.
[135:00.17]What?
[135:00.73]What do you mean?
[135:02.29]What's going on?
[135:02.83]Put the weapon away.
[135:04.03]We're on the battlements.
[135:05.15]What?
[135:12.74]Why did everybody freak out?
[135:15.26]What is it?
[135:16.18]Oh my god, give me a break.
[135:19.38]What's going on?
[135:20.02]What's going on?
[135:22.36]I don't know.
[135:22.95]We're really close.
[135:24.21]It doesn't make sense.
[135:25.21]Why would Sigismund advance on Talmog in the night?
[135:28.15]Especially since he's lost the element of surprise after the raid on Scallops.
[135:31.95]Maybe it's not him.
[135:34.16]Then who is it?
[135:35.45]I feel like I'm green screened into here.
[135:37.05]The spy on Sigismund said he'd set up camp and was getting ready to storm the castle.
[135:41.77]And so Radzig is an experienced soldier.
[135:44.27]He'd surely hold the castle for quite some time.
[135:47.09]It doesn't make sense.
[135:48.99]What else did he say?
[135:49.61]Bad strategy.
[135:50.27]Doesn't make sense.
[135:51.31]Not much of anything.
[135:52.89]Before they could get close enough, this huge storm started.
[135:56.17]And you were right.
[135:57.33]Sigismund has a hell of a lot of soldiers.
[135:59.63]Including all manner of mercenaries.
[136:01.97]An army like that costs a fortune.
[136:03.99]Well, anyway, we'll find out when they get here, won't we?
[136:08.11]We will.
[136:09.33]The army is about to go to the battlements to talk to Captain Roland.
[136:13.58]And then watch another cutscene.
[136:20.50]I remember this scene from Monty Python.
[136:22.92]Who goes there?
[136:24.32]Lucifer and all his minions.
[136:26.23]Who else, Ramal?
[136:27.57]Sir Antig.
[136:28.65]What a relief.
[136:29.51]Oh no, this means more cutscenes.
[136:32.01]Yes, sir, he is right here.
[136:36.35]What are you doing up so late, Divish?
[136:38.43]At your age, you need a good night's sleep.
[136:41.37]Well, Rantic, you didn't exactly pick the best time for an outing either.
[136:45.36]In a big hurry?
[136:46.50]It was a bit of a scramble, alright.
[136:49.06]Believe it or not, this Tempest is a godsend
[136:52.58]How do you hold torches in the rain?
[136:53.84]When they all get put out?
[136:54.50]That sounds like it's if Kermit the Frog was not trying to do Kermit the Var- That's Steve Whitmire talking in his normal speaking voice.
[136:58.93]Look it up.
[137:16.55]But tell me, friend, how on Earth did you manage to get away?
[137:20.63]Thank God for this tempest.
[137:22.73]When it began, Sigismund's tatars crawled into their holes and left a storm in the castle for more clement weather.
[137:29.05]We were able to sneak out right under the... I'm glad I actually bothered to have a sensible and extensive detailed story.
[137:34.53]Cutscenes are too long.
[137:35.77]Wait, why didn't I say that?
[137:36.95]No, no.
[137:39.04]When Sigismund finds the castle empty tomorrow, he might come looking for us.
[137:42.96]We'd only be exposing you to danger.
[137:45.24]Without me and my men here,
[137:47.41]Yeah, they don't have to talk this far away.
[137:48.75]What will you do then?
[137:50.03]We'll march to Rattay.
[137:51.35]Dude, they had back in the mid... Throw a cup down there with a string on it.
[137:55.11]That was in medieval times, right?
[137:57.97]You know, you hold it to your ear while they talk with a string.
[137:59.77]If Sigismund should come, better bend your knee, Divish.
[138:03.54]There's no point dying in a battle that's futile.
[138:06.94]You're right there.
[138:07.68]Is that boy still with you?
[138:11.19]The boy.
[138:11.69]Which one is the boy?
[138:12.61]This is the boy.
[138:13.21]They aren't.
[138:13.55]The whole town burnt to the ground.
[138:40.45]Donkey.
[138:41.09]Quiet!
[138:42.88]The salmon is fucking raw.
[138:46.28]Donkey.
[138:47.48]Make sure that lad doesn't budge from Talmberg until things quieten down.
[138:54.62]Not to worry, friend.
[138:56.53]Anyway, he's injured and needs to recover.
[138:59.35]I'll lock him up here as if he were Havel of Balding.
[139:03.97]They thought that was funny.
[139:05.09]Thank you.
[139:09.74]That was it.
[139:10.26]Okay, let's go, everybody.
[139:38.56]Is this on Netflix?
[139:41.34]It might be.
[139:42.44]Soon.
[139:42.72]Alright.
[139:48.49]Can I be of help?
[139:58.71]I could use an extra pair of eyes, and yours are keen.
[140:01.53]Will you keep watch of the battlements with my men?
[140:03.67]More watching?
[140:04.39]Will you watch a cutscene with me and my men?
[140:06.15]I'd rather it was a request you answered yes to.
[140:08.59]Of course I'll help.
[140:10.71]I'll have to pay you back somehow after all you've done for me.
[140:13.43]Splendid.
[140:13.96]And don't worry.
[140:15.62]I'll tell the men to relieve you later.
[140:18.98]I'll have to get something to eat.
[140:20.30]I'm starting to get hungry.
[140:21.84]Well, I can't leave.
[140:22.68]What the hell?
[140:24.96]Keep watching.
[140:25.64]Yeah, watch the battlements cutscene.
[140:32.80]Alright, what do I have to do?
[140:36.12]Just stay here.
[140:37.44]But I'm hungry.
[140:38.00]I'm gonna eat one of the 50 apples I own.
[140:42.94]I'm gonna eat a shitload of onions.
[140:49.06]Can I get onion poisoning if I do this too much?
[140:50.76]Alright, I'm good.
[141:07.05]Is there anything interesting I can do here?
[141:13.48]I don't think so.
[141:19.46]I really do just have to walk around.
[141:21.04]What if I just go to bed?
[141:21.76]I'm going to take an arrow right to the face.
[141:31.97]Hi, guys.
[141:33.41]Good day to you.
[141:35.73]Funny streamer jumps off.
[141:38.87]What do you think about that surprise during the night?
[141:40.71]I tried.
[141:41.01]I was surprised, alright.
[141:45.97]I'm glad them people were safe, though.
[141:48.13]I'm just as glad it weren't sick.
[141:50.13]What's going on?
[141:50.75]What just happened?
[141:51.47]This turned into a different guy.
[141:53.51]Huh?
[141:53.67]I will.
[141:54.03]Thank you.
[142:08.72]Where am I?
[142:18.29]Okay.
[142:20.63]I guess we're gonna wait it out.
[142:22.13]So, uh, let's press T. How long do I have to wait for?
[142:27.75]How long is it till morning?
[142:29.28]Like, right here?
[142:30.36]Let's wait, like, let's wait five hours.
[142:33.66]Is that too much?
[142:34.24]Am I standing here for five hours?
[142:35.98]Wait, no, no, no.
[142:36.50]Too much time, right?
[142:48.95]Oh, wait, hold on.
[142:52.45]Something's going on.
[142:59.47]Wait until morning.
[143:00.19]I got it, I'm good, I got it, I got it, I got it!
[143:02.33]Go, uh... Get the fuck out of the way.
[143:14.61]Alright.
[143:18.18]Are you serious?
[143:19.72]What?
[143:20.30]We both... Hey!
[143:21.24]Oh, my God.
[143:37.32]Overslept on the first day of work.
[143:44.64]Is the same thing gonna happen again?
[143:46.35]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if we get another, like, town gets destroyed cutscene and I have to get away on a horse.
[143:56.41]See how the self-appointed king wins the love and respect of his loyal subjects.
[144:02.62]Indeed, Robard.
[144:04.30]I hope that happens again.
[144:05.06]The Sigismund of Luxembourg has a rare talent for winning people over to his cause.
[144:12.66]You may be in for a surprise.
[144:15.40]I don't think he will set his heathen dogs on us today.
[144:19.05]Alright, throw down the cup, please.
[144:22.23]Greetings, Lord of Talmberg.
[144:25.81]Shit.
[144:27.75]That's the bastard who led the attack on Scullers and killed my parents.
[144:31.54]Don't be an idiot.
[144:33.14]Do you want to end up like them?
[144:37.05]I am Sir Markvart von Aulitz.
[144:39.84]I come in the name of Sigismund of Luxembourg, king of Hungary and Croatia.
[144:44.68]King of two different places.
[144:45.68]Strike against those who disrupt Concord in the land and to restore order in the name of his brother, King Wenceslaus IV.
[144:55.72]Right.
[144:55.98]Restore order by burning and pillaging the king's estates.
[145:00.52]Greetings, Sir Markvart.
[145:03.12]The efforts of the king's brother to bring order to this chaotic land are undoubtedly noble.
[145:10.74]It seems to me, though, that he and his army have somewhat strayed.
[145:15.82]As Burgrave of Prague Castle, I am entirely beholden to the king.
[145:20.54]And here in Talmberg, divine peace reigned until your arrival.
[145:26.17]To what, then, do we owe the honor of your visit?
[145:28.63]Write it down.
[145:30.10]Yesterday, his majesty took action against the enemy of the kingdom, Sir Radzik Kobila, who has been using the silver from the Skullet's mine to fund insurrection against the crown.
[145:42.67]Unfortunately, the insurgent escaped.
[145:46.79]Would you happen to know, noble sir, where he might be at this time?
[145:52.49]As far as I know, the Sir Radzik of which you speak is the king's hetman at Skullet's.
[145:59.76]Yeah.
[146:00.14]Detective Screamer.
[146:00.66]Huh?
[146:27.55]Am I to inform the King then that the Radzig-Kobila is not a town burg and that he has your loyalty?
[146:37.06]Sir Radzig-Kobila is not here and I have no intentions of getting embroiled in affairs from which I have nothing to gain.
[146:46.90]Very well, sir.
[146:49.12]As you wish.
[146:50.86]I will relay words to the King in the hope he will be as well disposed
[146:56.98]Is this Battletoads?
[146:57.88]What the fuck are you talking about?
[147:00.63]This is Battletoads.
[147:01.85]What are you talking about?
[147:31.53]Let it down Charge See that means go
[147:54.18]Stop cheering.
[147:54.76]They can hear you guys.
[147:58.62]Now, what he did, he put his hand there.
[147:59.64]He's like, yeah, just do whatever you want.
[148:00.88]I don't care.
[148:01.72]Just make sure it's all dead.
[148:13.38]Can he see me?
[148:14.04]I thought he was looking... Here it comes.
[148:17.29]Here comes the eye contact.
[148:22.81]Cool.
[148:31.45]Bury your loved ones in... Oh my god.
[148:34.97]Bury your loved ones?
[148:36.07]I have to go bury my loved ones.
[148:38.97]What is it?
[148:40.29]God almighty.
[148:42.39]I want to put down the torch.
[148:44.77]Cabbage is free cabbage, man!
[148:49.23]What happened to you?
[148:53.93]I can't take these.
[148:58.94]Alright, let's go do this.
[149:02.66]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[149:05.80]Put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down.
[149:07.20]I'm going to take the torch off.
[149:13.81]Let's go get a horse and let's go back and bury the parents.
[149:19.41]Oh, come on, man, really?
[149:23.15]Talk to him.
[149:23.65]God be with you.
[149:27.13]I need a horse.
[149:28.43]I have to get here.
[149:30.52]I have to get here.
[149:31.38]What?
[149:32.04]I can threaten him.
[149:33.64]That would not be a good idea.
[149:59.98]I have the most points here.
[150:02.48]Let's go with... Oh, man.
[150:27.49]Okay.
[150:28.39]Um... We need to get out of the castle and get... We need to get a horse and get out of the castle.
[150:35.85]Where can I do that?
[150:39.52]Do I just have to steal a horse?
[150:41.40]That's easy enough.
[150:45.70]Just get a horse.
[150:46.42]Easy.
[150:46.72]Am I gonna... Is this gonna cause a problem eventually?
[150:58.41]Let's see if we can get any people to let me out.
[151:00.27]I need to get out of here.
[151:03.32]I need to get out of here.
[151:04.80]It's yours.
[151:05.02]Um...
[151:27.03]Not any longer.
[151:27.67]I have vital information for Sir Radzig from Sir Divish's spies.
[151:31.93]The fate of the Scallet's people depends on it.
[151:34.49]Sir Robard ordered me to leave immediately, so let me out, quickly.
[151:38.23]A likely story.
[151:39.53]Alright, well I can't... I better clear off before I lose my temper.
[151:42.31]Okay.
[151:45.82]Um... That didn't work.
[151:49.26]Let me out, I say.
[151:50.40]Don't you know who I am?
[151:51.68]Someone who's about to lose his teeth if he doesn't get lost quick.
[151:57.46]I'm just gonna jump over the cliff.
[151:58.59]I'm gonna crawl over and jump.
[152:01.21]It worked!
[152:01.45]You got anything in mind?
[152:16.47]How should I know?
[152:17.77]Get a disguise?
[152:18.29]Maybe some disguise so I could say I didn't recognize you?
[152:21.21]Okay.
[152:21.55]If a Talenberg soldier turns up all kitted out properly in armor and a helmet, then of course I'll let him go.
[152:29.48]That's obvious.
[152:30.18]So I gotta get armor.
[152:31.30]I'll have a look around for something.
[152:33.94]Get some armor.
[152:35.68]Take it easy, man.
[152:36.26]Thanks for the help.
[152:41.68]Now we have a quest.
[152:47.92]Over here?
[152:50.62]Make sure you get a horse before you leave.
[152:52.06]I will.
[152:54.02]I think I have to break into somebody's bedroom, I think.
[152:56.20]I'm going to assume.
[152:56.80]Oh, hi.
[152:58.58]Yep.
[152:58.92]This is this guy's room.
[153:01.50]Good day.
[153:02.90]Nobody behind me.
[153:03.62]Nobody in front.
[153:04.86]Let's go.
[153:09.33]I don't know.
[153:09.61]I need a lockpick.
[153:10.55]Okay, I need to buy a lockpick.
[153:18.78]Let's kill this guy.
[153:20.93]Go to the general store, buy a couple lockpicks.
[153:25.35]Which is right here, right?
[153:28.87]Market.
[153:34.42]Perfect stealth.
[153:37.96]I need to get out of here.
[153:45.06]Knock him out?
[153:46.63]No, not yet.
[153:50.13]Last time I tried to do that, it backfired.
[153:51.78]Where's this trader?
[153:55.96]Villager.
[153:56.38]Is this the trader?
[154:03.07]Jesus Christ be praised.
[154:05.31]Oh, here it is.
[154:08.59]If you've got the coin.
[154:09.75]Okay, lockpick.
[154:12.19]Here's one lockpick.

[155:02.66]Uh, give him the arrow.
[155:06.58]Okay, you pay 10, I still, uh, um, more apples?
[155:16.54]I can't, I can't afford this.

[155:20.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[155:28.39]Hold on, check the basket.
[155:29.33]Take the clothes back.
[155:34.54]Okay.

[155:37.82]This is better fucking work.
[155:42.28]I could do more cheese.
[155:51.82]I still need 1.5.
[155:52.90]I got 19 carrots.
[155:59.64]There we go.
[156:01.12]Check the basket.
[156:03.32]Give me that one lockpick.
[156:04.52]Close the deal.
[156:06.06]Thank you, sir.
[156:07.70]See you later.
[156:10.28]Haggle?
[156:10.68]I don't think I have the necessary haggling skills.
[156:14.77]Get my shirt back.
[156:19.51]I'm good.
[156:21.49]Shirt's back on.
[156:23.31]Breaking this guy's house.
[156:27.11]Take his armor.
[156:29.41]Sell my current clothes.
[156:36.67]Okay, here we go.
[156:42.91]Can I lock the door?
[156:44.03]No.
[156:44.43]Alright, here we go.
[156:45.62]Open it.
[156:46.08]Very easy.
[156:50.90]How does this work?
[156:52.98]I have no idea what I'm looking at right now.
[157:07.39]What am I looking at?
[157:13.59]Where's the tutorial for this?
[157:26.37]It's not gonna teach me how to fucking do that?
[157:31.03]What?
[157:31.19]I had to pre- Did it actually- Oh my fucking lord in heaven.
[157:45.49]What the fuck am I doing?
[157:55.41]Okay.
[157:59.15]Turns gold.
[158:01.19]Then you have to use the lockpick D to turn the whole lockpick.
[158:04.37]At the same time, you have to coordinate the movement of the lockpick with the rotation of the mechanism.
[158:11.66]So I just have to stay gold the whole time.
[158:14.54]Oh my fucking lord.
[158:15.94]Oh my god.
[158:16.61]Why?
[158:16.75]Why god?
[158:17.29]Why god?
[158:35.56]I'm about to bury... I'm about to stab this guy in the head.
[158:42.71]Well, give me a little bit of credit.
[158:44.79]Every other single time a tutorial is supposed to happen, it just popped up on the screen.
[158:49.63]During, like, combat.
[158:50.59]During dialogue.
[158:52.67]It was like, boom!
[158:53.57]Hey, don't move.
[158:55.27]Read this for a second.
[158:56.07]I just was going.
[158:57.15]The way my back is now...
[159:04.59]Well, okay, I need to figure out something else now, apparently.
[159:10.83]Can I just, like, walk out the front fucking door?
[159:17.42]Just step off the bridge.
[159:22.12]Well, I need a horse.
[159:25.72]Um, run.
[159:29.54]Optional, get a horse.
[159:30.74]Optional, get out of the castle.
[159:32.02]I just need to get out of the castle.
[159:34.91]The lockpick didn't break.
[159:35.83]Are you sure about that?
[159:39.53]No, it didn't.
[159:46.16]I can't... Okay.
[160:05.20]Apparently it's that easy just to leave.
[160:09.32]Now I need to go back to... No, I don't want the armor.
[160:12.72]Oh, man.
[160:13.54]Okay, it's fast travel to here, right?
[160:19.17]You can't fast travel just now.
[160:22.85]Why not?
[160:26.65]Get a horse.
[160:30.93]Where's her horse?
[160:31.81]Just hanging out somewhere around here, maybe?
[160:33.59]Somebody has a horse I can steal?
[160:34.83]I think they're gonna see me outside the castle, right?
[160:40.00]And it's gonna be a problem.
[160:46.16]I just need to get on this road.
[160:47.16]I mean, is this stables right here?
[160:54.19]Activity giver?
[160:55.31]Unexplored place?
[160:56.01]You can just explore, huh?
[161:01.04]Well, let's just put a marker and just go.
[161:10.17]Can I make it above the rocks?
[161:16.85]Just go?
[161:17.33]Alright, here we go.
[161:28.83]It's running back home.
[161:35.11]Is there anything?
[161:35.55]Is there wildlife?
[161:36.34]Am I going to get attacked by a giant boar or something?
[161:50.91]Alright.
[161:51.47]Now that I'm out, can I fast travel now?
[162:03.56]There we go.
[162:05.31]Apparently I can't.
[162:08.05]We just gotta run there, apparently.
[162:15.89]Horse?
[162:16.51]No, that's a dog.
[162:19.15]Can I ride the dog?
[162:19.95]Is that a mean dog or is it a good dog?
[162:22.57]I don't know.
[162:24.05]What?
[162:27.73]I ain't fucking with a dog.
[162:31.53]Bye.
[162:39.00]That was a little baby horse.
[162:47.24]Watch out for bandits.
[162:50.50]Don't tell me that's possible, right?
[162:52.66]It probably is.
[162:53.32]I didn't get a horse.
[162:59.24]But it's okay.
[163:12.35]Did I make it?
[163:12.93]This is the point of armor.
[163:34.00]How am I going to find my parents in this mess?
[163:40.98]I found a horse.
[163:41.62]Why would I come back here?
[164:10.59]Pretty nice Star Wars music.
[164:19.45]Okay.
[164:21.07]Run.
[164:22.45]Completed.
[164:30.82]Homecoming!
[164:32.86]Find your parents.
[164:44.51]Is that guy alive?
[164:45.15]Okay, that's a bandit.
[164:48.06]I found a bandit.
[164:48.64]Most people don't want to die.
[164:50.32]Victor can decide what to do with them.
[164:51.86]Uh...
[165:15.75]Let him go disarmed, continue combat, release him unconditionally.
[165:25.66]I'll take the weapon.
[165:29.24]Thanks for the weapon, dude.
[165:33.08]By the way... They call me the cruel and unusual Punisher!
[165:39.21]For a fucking reason!
[166:08.39]I got a bunch of new stuff.
[166:12.06]Wow, this is worth it.
[166:13.56]This was worth it.
[166:20.74]Nice.
[166:23.48]That's so good.
[166:24.45]Anybody have anything else?
[166:27.11]Okay, I got new stuff.
[166:32.89]I got foot wraps.
[166:36.69]What about you?
[166:39.23]His dying wish was to eat one more pretzel.
[166:47.73]He was just on his way back from... What's a pretzel store?
[166:55.88]Good sleeper.
[166:56.36]I need to eat.
[167:07.51]Is this moldy bread?
[167:10.86]No.
[167:11.20]Okay, I'm good.
[167:13.60]I got the cooked chicken, too.
[167:20.27]This is kind of gross.
[167:20.95]These people have been sitting out here for a long time.
[167:25.41]Grab the bandit's sword.
[167:29.81]Oh, shit.
[167:36.50]Was it just on the ground next to him?
[167:38.68]Wouldn't it have been on his dead body?
[167:43.50]This is not him, but another person here.
[167:51.29]Where did that guy die?
[167:52.01]Right here?
[167:58.19]I don't think he has anything.
[168:02.46]No.
[168:03.46]He gave me the sword?
[168:04.54]What?
[168:06.50]All I have is a torch.
[168:10.51]I made him give it up.
[168:11.31]He just dropped it on the ground.
[168:13.57]I thought he didn't give it to me.
[168:15.97]That was like right over here.
[168:16.74]I'm using like Sir Roderick's weapon.
[168:21.92]Who cares?
[168:37.12]It doesn't matter.
[168:39.18]Like, it would be, like, over there.
[168:41.37]Sword's probably better.
[168:42.07]That guy had, like, a little dagger.
[168:43.11]Alright, fine.
[168:49.09]Mom and Dad.
[168:49.61]Did somebody say I was poisoned?
[168:55.28]What do you mean, poisoned?
[169:03.08]You guys have a lot of cool stuff on you.
[169:09.76]Weight's not a problem right now.
[169:19.14]I ate tainted food.
[169:20.92]I ate five rotten apples.
[169:25.78]Take it all.
[169:33.47]Where are the cutscenes that I so paid for?
[169:39.35]Alright, what's the... How can you determine if it's rotten or not?
[169:41.53]Condition?
[169:42.11]Okay, that's why.
[169:42.99]I see what you're saying.
[169:45.93]So this is at 25% freshness.
[169:49.37]Yeah, I'll leave it.
[169:55.39]Bread is in good condition.
[169:56.33]I'm just going to sell it anyways.
[170:01.53]I don't want to pair any torches.
[170:02.93]That's fine.
[170:03.45]Alright, mom?
[170:06.71]Sweet Jesus.
[170:10.56]A lot of pretzels.
[170:11.42]Okay.
[170:15.78]Dried mushrooms, more horseradish.
[170:19.41]I'm getting more materials on all these dead bodies than anything else in the whole game so far.
[170:33.47]I got a lot of pretzels.
[170:37.67]What?
[170:43.21]I thought, what, did, who just, that just scared the shit out of me.
[170:48.15]Who just screamed hey?
[170:53.83]Huh?
[171:01.64]Am I in here?
[171:10.81]I'm fucking blind?
[171:11.85]What do you mean blind?
[171:13.49]Where's the person that screamed hey?
[171:15.33]Was he in the grass?
[171:22.93]Why would anyone do this?
[171:25.13]What did these poor souls ever do to them?
[171:28.59]Where do you see this person?
[171:34.85]He was?
[171:35.17]Why did he leave?
[171:42.79]He was on the road.
[171:43.69]He ran off.
[171:44.69]Alright, I don't need to pick up every single item.
[171:54.11]But I kind of do.
[171:54.95]Hey!
[171:59.77]Okay, is that a bandit or is that a good guy?
[172:19.29]That's it.
[172:19.85]Easy.
[172:26.20]Is he dead?
[172:26.64]Did I kill him?
[172:27.20]Is he dead?
[172:27.64]I think he's dead.
[172:31.92]Yep, got him.
[172:33.80]Well, now we have even more shit.
[172:37.04]What about his weapon?
[172:40.29]Why couldn't they all be as easy as this, these guys?
[172:42.27]Alright, what about the axe?
[172:50.63]Oh, now we're talking.
[172:54.51]Axe, 22.
[172:55.23]What's this?
[172:56.53]What is Roderick's weapon?
[172:57.45]45.
[173:03.01]This thing is way better.
[173:10.34]Why would I even ever not have this on?
[173:15.86]I need to throw some shit away.
[173:16.80]Alright, we got armor.
[173:18.92]This is leather jerkins.
[173:21.06]Hunter's gloves.
[173:21.88]Five foot wraps.
[173:24.12]I could probably just drop this shit.
[173:25.82]This is worth a lot of money, though.
[173:26.84]Alright, let's sort this.
[173:29.36]I already have this on.
[173:32.00]I have that on.
[173:33.64]Plate.
[173:35.43]Noble's shoes.
[173:37.96]I got this better, this leather, uh, leather gherkin.
[173:41.64]Coif.
[173:42.48]So I can drop some of this stuff.
[173:44.32]The green shirt, it's worth a lot of money.
[173:57.61]Damn it!
[174:00.49]I shouldn't have looted.
[174:01.33]2,000 pretzels.
[174:06.57]Wait, do I have 99?
[174:09.11]No, I do not have 99.
[174:10.43]Wait, where's the number?
[174:11.71]What do I have the most of?
[174:12.64]I only got, please, I have five apples.
[174:20.60]There goes my fucking stew I was gonna make.
[174:30.06]Alright, nourishment's at 119.
[174:30.84]What am I... Okay, dried mushrooms.
[174:35.03]Drop these.
[174:37.51]Drop them all.
[174:40.95]Anything that's rotten.
[174:43.11]Dried fruit.
[174:43.85]That's... Get out of here.
[174:46.57]Horsesprout is just junk.
[174:48.99]These pears are junk.
[174:53.70]Cooked chicken.
[174:54.70]Just eat it.
[174:57.46]You're stuffed.
[174:58.30]It's alright.
[174:58.72]Well, it'll be fine in a little bit.
[175:00.82]Now, what about armor?
[175:01.56]What about weapons?
[175:02.66]Axe?
[175:02.86]This axe is useless.
[175:04.04]It's a 33% durability.
[175:06.46]Get the fuck out of here.
[175:07.80]Alright, we're fine.
[175:14.20]What's a pig?
[175:16.64]No, don't pick any of this shit up.
[175:17.66]What did I say?
[175:18.04]You've eaten too much.
[175:18.76]You won't get hungry for a much longer time now, but you'll be heavy-handed and clumsy.
[175:27.20]Okay, that's kind of funny.
[175:30.10]I just, I'm an obsessive compulsive gambler.
[175:33.64]I just need to loot everything.
[175:39.64]Just eat the axe.
[175:51.39]I can't, I have to do it.
[175:54.71]How do I get in here?
[176:00.72]Find your parents.
[176:03.04]Well, the front door is blocked off.
[176:12.88]Steal the axe and nails now that the guy's dead.
[176:15.44]Not a bad idea.
[176:18.20]Get up here.
[176:21.02]So, can I not just... Do I have to find an entrance?
[176:26.18]Find a way to go around?
[176:27.29]I'm just going to walk around.
[176:34.34]Shit's going to rot in my inventory anyways.
[176:38.95]I probably went the wrong way.
[176:42.55]You're just as bad as the bandits.
[176:43.69]That's not true because I was one hit killing the bandits.
[176:46.15]They are way worse than I am.
[176:54.20]You're telling me that I have to go the other way?
[176:58.16]There's a back entrance, right?
[177:07.78]Where am I?
[177:10.06]Almost there.
[177:12.14]The main gate.
[177:13.06]Wait.
[177:13.76]The main gate was closed.
[177:17.18]This is blocked off.
[177:20.22]I'm going to go to the back entrance.
[177:21.82]Because the main gate is blocked off.
[177:29.10]That's the thing with all the smoldering stuff there.
[177:35.39]I'll be there in a second.
[177:36.01]Don't worry.
[177:39.74]I did go the long way, but you know, sometimes you go the long way.
[177:47.85]Almost there.
[177:48.37]There we go.
[177:52.72]Okay.
[177:53.14]Made it.
[177:55.10]Back entrance.
[178:03.37]Follow the path.
[178:04.39]It'll lead us there eventually, right?
[178:14.64]Get the fuck out of my way, game.
[178:32.83]There's another entrance right here.
[178:34.15]Get over the rocks.
[178:44.51]I better not get hurt.
[178:46.19]Oh, God damn it.
[178:46.99]I'm falling.
[178:54.72]Eat the rubble blocking the entrance.
[178:57.78]Almost there.
[178:59.06]Look, look, look, look, look.
[178:59.88]We're there.
[179:03.36]Right here.
[179:11.98]Do you think this is Skyrim?
[179:30.37]Could I have just gone to the right in one of the other entrances?
[179:32.71]Okay, we're at the back entrance.
[179:56.42]Is this just the sorcery map all over again?
[180:00.57]This one, then.
[180:01.93]It's the only other one that's potentially open.
[180:04.33]Right?
[180:09.50]Wish I had a horse.
[180:23.49]Do I spy a way in?
[180:27.11]Right here.
[180:31.71]More bodies to loot.
[180:39.48]Wait, how is this me being dumb?
[180:42.48]There's only one entrance.
[180:43.68]This guy's fucked, by the way.
[180:50.45]Well, I never.
[180:52.07]The pig turns up willingly for the slaughter.
[181:14.88]Bludgeon?
[181:16.40]Where did he go?
[181:24.33]Huh?
[181:27.35]Is he still in there?
[181:36.34]he go?
[181:36.84]Am I blind or is it this guy right here?
[181:45.20]He ran.
[181:46.81]Which way did he run?
[181:48.17]I let him go.
[182:03.78]In the gate.
[182:12.47]I don't even care anymore.
[182:13.59]Let's go.
[182:16.81]Well, I'm reading chat every, like, 12 seconds.
[182:23.54]You want me to not read chat ever again?
[182:25.36]Because you do realize that every, like, 9 seconds, I'm looking over at my other screen.
[182:34.92]You know that that's a thing, right?
[182:39.02]Ignore us.
[182:39.68]Why?
[182:40.00]I don't want to ignore you guys.
[182:41.04]We're hanging out.
[182:42.33]Don't take any advice.
[182:43.03]Why are you looting?
[182:43.75]I didn't loot anything.
[182:46.11]I ran by everybody.
[182:46.87]Why are they not...
[183:12.38]Oh, never mind.
[183:20.56]Why did you do it to me, Father?
[183:24.64]Why?
[183:27.37]Why did you leave me?
[183:34.71]Forgive me.
[183:38.13]Forgive me for everything.
[183:40.27]This game.
[183:43.28]Next time I won't run.
[183:47.31]I'll never run away again.
[183:48.67]He can't hear you, dude.
[183:54.05]I'll find the one who did this to you.
[183:57.33]I remember his face.
[183:58.91]I'll find him.
[184:05.28]But first...
[184:12.21]Find a shovel and I'll take care of you.
[184:24.28]I remember you told me you wanted to lie beside Mother.
[184:29.62]Here.
[184:32.31]Under the linden tree.
[184:33.23]At least I can do that much for you.
[184:51.13]I feel like, um... I feel like I didn't have to go to the other castle and, like, come back here.
[184:56.65]I feel like I could have, like... They couldn't have me, like, hide in a bush for, like, an hour or something?
[185:02.28]And then do this scene and then go to the castle?
[185:16.20]Ah, just a couple of pretzels!
[185:29.65]Go find a spade.
[185:30.85]Wait, what's... Why is it doing this?
[185:43.36]Cut it out.
[185:46.52]Can you pick up the arrows?
[185:50.98]I don't know.
[185:52.90]But we're going this way.
[185:58.10]I guess it's just right here.
[186:00.60]Where's the spade, mom?
[186:06.82]You don't have the spade.
[186:11.94]Over here.
[186:16.59]What is going on?
[186:17.39]The quest marker is just moving around with me.
[186:20.37]Do I... Okay.
[186:24.83]What is going on here?
[186:27.57]Have I lost my goddamn mind?
[186:33.42]Why is the quest marker moving in every direction with me?
[186:43.27]What is it to find it?
[186:46.61]Okay.
[186:51.00]Find a shovel.
[186:56.44]Is one dug into the ground somewhere?
[186:58.10]I would assume it would have to be close.
[187:07.18]How about this way?
[187:10.10]In the well.
[187:18.39]Smart video.
[187:19.39]Where is it?
[187:20.11]Where is it?
[187:21.09]Where's the shovel?
[187:21.99]Where is it?
[187:22.95]If you guys all know.
[187:31.75]I gotta follow the barks.
[187:33.19]Don't tell me that.
[187:34.07]Don't you dare tell me I have to follow the barks.
[187:36.19]I will not believe you.
[187:39.17]What about in this house?
[187:39.83]Alright, Etalyx told me.
[187:48.72]I'm gonna give you what Etalyx told me.
[187:50.50]He said, please God, just play the game for four hours.
[187:53.42]It's awful.
[187:54.58]And then after four hours, the game's good.
[187:59.50]We're almost at the fucking three hour mark.
[188:04.38]I hear a pig.
[188:04.94]I don't hear a dog, I hear a pig.
[188:13.05]That was a pig noise, not a dog.
[188:19.53]You've reached a new level in speech.
[188:22.57]Because I'm talking.
[188:23.41]Follow the pig.
[188:24.21]What?
[188:35.05]I talked to myself and I got extra fucking points.
[188:36.88]Alright, I just, where is this?
[188:40.18]I just heard another, like, guy talk.
[188:50.56]Where are you?
[188:53.52]Guy with a dog.
[189:05.54]Where's the dog?
[189:06.60]I hear him.
[189:21.68]I'm just walking in circles.
[189:24.56]Follow your heart.
[189:26.97]Is he in here?
[189:34.78]Is there a shovel in here?
[189:35.70]Can I look out the window?
[189:51.01]What is going on here?
[189:59.33]Oh my fucking god.
[190:05.84]You act... Get away, you beast!
[190:17.13]What's going on?
[190:18.67]It's Meshach.
[190:20.29]What in God's name are you doing?
[190:22.59]What do you think I'm doing?
[190:23.47]Digging turnips?
[190:25.13]The beast just went for me.
[190:27.11]Isn't that the butcher's...
[190:31.47]You actually had to follow the barks.
[190:33.13]You did.
[190:33.53]Yeah, that's him.
[190:37.18]What's that got to do with anything?
[190:38.36]Oh man.
[190:48.41]I'd say the poor creature is standing guard over his master.
[190:52.05]You weren't trying to get to him, were you?
[190:53.89]What do you care what I'm doing here?
[190:56.71]What are you doing here?
[191:02.19]I came to bury my parents.
[191:04.48]So bury them and leave me be.
[191:07.08]Okay, thanks.
[191:09.74]I have higher speech than him.
[191:13.84]Fuck you!
[191:14.44]No, just give me the spade.
[191:15.50]Give me that spade.
[191:16.24]I have to dig a grave and I can't find another.
[191:20.11]What's it worth to you?
[191:22.81]I see you have a fine sword.
[191:24.83]I'll gladly trade you my spade for that.
[191:27.59]How did you come by it anyway?
[191:33.35]He's stronger than me.
[191:35.03]My father forged it for Sir Radzig.
[191:37.69]It's my duty to deliver it to him.
[191:40.79]It's not for sale.
[191:43.29]Do the finger wag so he knows you mean business.
[191:47.32]See how that goes.
[191:49.32]And where will you dig it anyway?
[191:51.08]Here?
[191:52.36]You're not going to lay your parents in unhallowed ground, are you?
[191:58.50]Father said he wanted to be buried here and I can't take him to St.
[192:01.27]James's.
[192:02.35]God willing, later I can find a priest to consecrate the ground.
[192:09.01]I see a cunt remains a cunt.
[192:10.99]No matter what the situation.
[192:12.69]I'm gonna kill him.
[192:13.66]Just give it to me.
[192:15.08]Oh, that's funny.
[192:16.28]Now you run, you fucking wuss.
[192:20.94]Give me the fucking... Give me the shovel.
[192:23.40]Give me the shovel.
[192:25.02]Right now.
[192:31.28]Give me the shovel.
[192:41.23]I'm getting so many points.
[192:48.77]I've reached a new level in strength.
[192:53.26]I've reached a new level.
[192:54.40]I've leveled up again.
[192:55.40]Okay.
[192:58.04]Cool.
[192:59.14]I've reached a new level in warfare.
[193:07.94]I love the vitality.
[193:08.86]I broke the whole game.
[193:17.45]Is it against the rules if I just farm the fuck out of this and just get a bunch of points?
[193:26.17]Can he give me the shovel, please?
[193:28.81]Did he drop it?
[193:30.73]Oh, there it is.
[193:32.35]Thanks.
[193:42.82]Okay.
[193:46.34]Good master won't be needing this anymore.
[193:50.48]I think I leveled up a few times, right?
[193:54.03]Combat.
[193:55.33]Sword.
[193:56.21]I got four.
[193:57.11]Skills.
[193:58.51]Pretty nice.
[193:59.09]Okay.
[194:05.15]Oh, wait.
[194:05.51]That's a dog.
[194:10.36]Dig a grape.
[194:13.77]There he is.
[194:16.73]He walked out here and rolled over.
[194:18.63]Give me your fucking bread.
[194:19.77]Take it all.
[194:23.99]Should have kept wailing on him, but then the game would have been ruined.
[194:33.92]That would have actually ruined the whole game.
[194:35.76]Wait, don't I have to... Do I have to carry my parents' bodies?
[194:42.10]Allocate myself.
[194:42.64]We'll do that afterwards.
[194:49.42]Under, like, the tree.
[194:51.53]Wait, where is this tree?
[194:52.59]It's outside.
[194:53.95]It's outside, isn't it?
[194:55.31]It's outside.
[195:02.75]Is that in the complex?
[195:09.60]God damn it, man.
[195:13.17]No, it's not.
[195:13.55]What do you mean no, it's not?
[195:15.75]Yes, it is.
[195:18.06]It's the house.
[195:18.72]But wait, why am I locked in here?
[195:20.44]Why do we have these fences?
[195:30.43]Can I get in through here?
[195:33.93]It's in here.
[195:34.57]To the left.
[195:37.65]Why am I the way that I am?
[195:39.29]I don't know.
[195:39.95]Why did I just get fucking 10 levels on this terrible shit game?
[195:44.71]You can't blame it all on me.
[195:47.94]This game is a D+, at best.
[196:09.12]This is a good place.
[196:09.74]It is a good place.
[196:22.29]Let's dig.
[196:22.57]Do I need to do anything in particular?
[196:23.78]Or do I just stand here and dig?
[196:27.74]What do you want me to do?
[196:28.88]Here?
[196:29.04]There?
[196:30.44]Right here?
[196:31.40]Right here?
[196:32.26]Right here?
[196:33.52]Okay.
[196:34.10]Put it on.
[196:36.75]Do I put it on?
[196:48.18]dig I I pressed e like three times what does this game have for a score right now I need to know
[197:23.88]68.
[197:24.52]What did I say?
[197:24.97]D plus?
[197:26.15]What did I tell you?
[197:26.63]It's got a 68 on Metacritic.
[197:30.95]I gave it a fucking literal D plus, and that's what it is.
[197:32.67]Let's get to it.
[197:50.33]Listen 68 isn't a d-plus.
[197:52.89]What are you talking about?
[197:53.99]68 is a d-plus 60 is a d-minus.
[197:59.69]What are you what what?
[198:10.09]Judging an RPG in the first three hours.
[198:11.83]What are you a games journalist?
[198:17.93]How long is this game
[198:21.07]That's a long D. How am I gonna do this?
[198:41.56]Do you need some help?
[198:47.26]Well, they're my friends.
[198:48.00]We threw shit at a guy's house, right?
[198:50.36]Yes.
[198:51.06]Can't you see the sword?
[198:51.94]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[198:52.66]I killed this guy.
[198:54.30]What do you want?
[198:57.12]What?
[198:58.90]The guy's dead.
[199:00.69]Franciscan brothers.
[199:06.47]We're to rob you of everything you've got.
[199:09.47]Especially that fine blade that's of no use to a peasant like you anyway.
[199:13.55]Banish the thought.
[199:15.67]It is my father's sword.
[199:18.98]You mean him?
[199:21.00]There's a different guy.
[199:22.02]Okay, let's kill these guys.
[199:25.88]Let's make it look good, too.
[199:28.82]I'll take this one.
[199:30.66]Everybody stay back.
[199:50.93]Why didn't he turn around and look away?
[199:59.81]Are you supposed to lose this?
[200:19.87]I told you how it would end.
[200:22.03]You should have listened to me.
[200:25.04]I didn't.
[200:26.00]You're just supposed to live.
[200:28.20]This is nice work.
[200:30.84]The chief is going.
[200:31.74]You should have leveled up.
[200:34.76]It's new, isn't it?
[200:37.76]You should have found more experience.
[200:39.66]Now, for the maiden bloodletting.
[200:42.95]Surely your father never would have imagined it.
[200:44.99]I hope he just kills me.
[200:50.37]I believe there's a word for such moments.
[200:54.57]The old man would certainly know.
[200:56.89]But I'm just a common killer.
[201:04.71]Did you help make it?
[201:07.45]No doubt you did.
[201:10.04]Such miserable luck.
[201:12.24]Who stops?
[201:13.54]Who arrows the guy in the neck?
[201:14.98]Yeah.
[201:19.61]There she is!
[201:20.31]Wasn't she dead on the ground?
[201:24.85]This is Star Wars again.
[202:00.71]Actually getting the title screen.
[202:05.45]Wait, am I dead?
[202:06.25]Oh wow, tutorial over.
[202:12.67]Wow, this must be a 500 hour game.
[202:18.48]This is not the end?
[202:19.06]No, it's not.
[202:23.26]This is not the end.
[202:34.49]No, they take me back and they heal me.
[202:50.57]Brian Blessed is in this?
[203:16.95]They take me back and they bury me.
[203:22.99]Gordon's alive!
[203:24.69]Did I lose the sword?
[203:45.24]I don't know.
[204:14.52]Isn't that the guy?
[204:15.84]This is a chef now.
[204:16.68]So we have a... Who's the chef?
[204:32.71]Alright, I get control now.
[204:36.31]Where are they?
[204:42.52]Save my parents!
[204:52.48]This is just a dream sequence, alright?
[204:54.52]Doesn't matter.
[204:55.06]People are gonna notice my bad behavior in a dream?
[205:06.26]Where are they?
[205:07.48]Found them.
[205:12.33]What do you mean it's not a dream?
[205:14.57]Yes, it is.
[205:15.15]I got a hair in my mouth.
[205:30.75]You failed the dream.
[205:32.99]Oh, yo, yo, yo.
[205:45.29]I'm getting deja vu so bad.
[205:46.81]Didn't we do this like three times?
[205:51.57]Didn't we already do this with the red virtual boy filter?
[206:00.04]And then the lady comes in and sits down and gives me wine and I tell her my life story again.
[206:04.12]Get up, Henry.
[206:05.02]Wake up.
[206:07.19]It's a new day.
[206:09.05]Henry, can you hear me?
[206:11.55]Didn't any of that stuff even happen?
[206:14.05]Hallelujah.
[206:15.93]I thought you'd never wake.
[206:18.47]Were you having a nightmare?
[206:19.83]Bald equals evil.
[206:21.67]Always.
[206:22.03]Teresa?
[206:25.81]You still have a fever.
[206:28.19]Uncle won't be pleased, but you'll have to stay in bed.
[206:37.26]Previously on AMC's Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[206:40.14]In Scarlet?
[206:42.47]They have one of those things you plug into the wall and it does the design around the room.
[206:47.97]It's a little dome with light.
[206:50.31]They had these back then?
[206:51.44]They had electricity?
[206:52.18]Why in heaven's name did you go back there?
[206:53.44]It was madness.
[206:54.10]They slaughtered everyone who didn't run.
[206:55.28]My parents.
[206:55.58]I wanted to bury them.
[206:57.02]I had to
[207:10.78]We still have a swanky room, you know what I mean?
[207:16.98]Thank you.
[207:19.92]A few delicious days later.
[207:28.27]Good morning.
[207:31.19]We just did this!
[207:34.57]We just did this already!
[207:36.31]Do I have a migraine or something?
[207:38.47]What's happening?
[207:39.55]Oh, I feel like a horse fell on me.
[207:41.45]The beating you took was worse.
[207:43.95]But at least the fever's broken.
[207:45.27]Ugh, I'm exhausted.
[207:50.97]I'm not surprised.
[207:52.43]I'll bring you water and something to eat.
[207:54.35]In the meantime, rest.
[207:55.59]You're still very weak.
[207:56.77]Meltdown 5.
[207:57.33]No, no, don't do it again.
[208:02.12]Don't wake up again.
[208:05.00]Good morning to you.
[208:06.40]How's the invalid today?
[208:08.50]I haven't felt as good as this since they lashed me to the wheel and caught me on the town square.
[208:14.13]I am getting a headache again.
[208:15.25]You must be better.
[208:16.71]My uncle will be glad to hear it.
[208:18.79]I had a job persuading him to let me bring you here.
[208:21.61]If you'd lain around much longer, he really would have dumped you on the town square.
[208:25.56]You can stay until you find somewhere else to live, but my uncle will want payment for taking me in and caring for you.
[208:31.06]You want payment?
[208:34.00]And this is your uncle's house.
[208:36.31]We're in Rattay Mill.
[208:37.57]My uncle's Miller Pesek.
[208:39.23]He took me in and I talked him into taking care of you too.
[208:44.47]Okay, I've been... Let me get up, please.
[208:47.70]Uncle will be pleased he's one mouth less to feed.
[208:50.56]But are you truly well enough?
[208:52.36]No, I don't want to sleep again.
[208:53.08]Well enough to do what has to be done?
[208:55.97]Where can I find Sir Radzug?
[208:58.10]He's in the lower castle in Perkstein.
[209:00.06]He's a guest of Sir Hannes of Leipa.
[209:02.45]But someone like you can't just walk up bold as you please and demand an audience.
[209:06.79]I know, Sir Ratzig.
[209:08.65]Just keep sleeping.
[209:10.73]I must see him.
[209:11.79]If you insist.
[209:13.37]But you need to speak to my uncle first.
[209:15.53]You've been in your sickbed for over a fortnight while he paid the apothecary to tend to you.
[209:19.49]At what point am I going to fill out the tax form?
[209:21.39]That's a good deal of a coin you owe him.
[209:23.50]I've been lying here two weeks.
[209:25.46]That's a long time.
[209:26.60]Better a fortnight in bed than an eternity in the grave.
[209:30.00]If it weren't for my uncle, you wouldn't be here at all.
[209:36.23]Fortnight.
[209:37.53]Fine.
[209:39.09]But right now, I have more important things to do.
[209:41.59]That's all you have to say?
[209:43.09]After everything we've done for you?
[209:45.48]Well, do as you see fit.
[209:49.45]This is your new home.
[209:51.25]You can sleep here whenever you want.
[209:53.09]You have your own trunk.
[209:54.97]Get your things from the trunk.
[209:58.18]Alright, we got... We got a bludgeon.
[210:03.16]And all my... All my shit is in here.
[210:04.82]Okay, hold on.
[210:09.28]Take one.
[210:09.76]Uh... Take the... No, I don't want the scarf.
[210:16.41]Alright, let's go food.
[210:18.33]Take these...
[210:22.25]I can make sure I have enough pretzels.
[210:25.23]Bring a bunch of duck.
[210:27.71]Bring the schnapps.
[210:30.53]Alright.
[210:33.12]Leave the rest in there for now.
[210:37.36]Put on the bludgeon.
[210:42.64]Okay.
[210:43.10]Wait.
[210:43.64]What's better?
[210:44.28]These are better.
[210:46.08]These are better.
[210:49.50]alright uh get your things from the trunk I just did it do I have to take it all I have to take everything of course I do alright vengeance get the sword back wow fine okay the world just opened up
[211:19.63]What's up?
[211:20.01]How are you?
[211:23.79]Can you tell me... Hey, thanks for taking care of me.
[211:27.83]Thank you for taking care of me here.
[211:30.05]My name's Peshik, and I'm the miller here.
[211:32.93]You've already met my niece, Teresa.
[211:35.01]And yes, this is my actual head shape.
[211:39.34]Don't you dare take this off and make fun of my weird head!
[211:42.38]While you were lying here.
[211:44.24]It's a little deflated.
[211:45.42]I used to be a fucking conehead.
[211:47.20]Who came now and again to keep you alive with his potions?
[211:50.68]That quack doesn't come cheap.
[211:52.89]I paid him what I could, but I still, that is, you still owe him.
[211:59.13]-2.
[211:59.73]I know, that was awful.
[212:01.13]Whatever, I don't care.
[212:03.09]What do I owe?
[212:04.48]I'm not afraid of hard work.
[212:06.02]You won't pay for that shoveling manure.
[212:09.08]I might have a better job for you.
[212:11.76]Don't make fun of my excess head skin.
[212:16.35]I might trust you with something you could really make money from.
[212:21.07]I'll make money.
[212:25.55]You should pay him for the debt.
[212:30.00]Look, couldn't I just pay you instead?
[212:31.78]How much money does he want?
[212:32.48]I'd say you're a fucking ungrateful pup.
[212:35.50]But if you think you've got money to throw around, so be it.
[212:39.02]You'll pay me the cost and for a whole fortnight of my valuable time.
[212:42.81]Okay.
[212:44.33]He wants 50.
[212:45.53]I don't have that much coin.
[212:47.19]Well, you'll get no money from me.
[212:49.47]And if I had, I wouldn't give it to you.
[212:51.41]I should have left you to rot in the ditch, you fucking ingrate.
[212:55.09]Get out of my sight and remember, you still owe me.
[213:00.18]Can I just pay you?
[213:01.02]I'll never forget.
[213:13.65]I gotta do a job for him.
[213:17.70]I changed my mind.
[213:19.64]I changed my mind.
[213:20.16]I missed with my weapon.
[213:22.52]Great.
[213:23.50]I was beginning to worry you really were an ungrateful bastard.
[213:28.48]What would you need from me?
[213:30.90]A trifle.
[213:32.26]Just to take something from someone and bring it to someone else.
[213:36.81]and not get caught while you're doing it.
[213:39.59]That sounds straightforward enough.
[213:41.49]Except for not get caught, why would anyone want to catch me?
[213:45.10]Oh, don't worry.
[213:45.80]It's just a job like any other.
[213:47.94]Only this one requires, let's say, the right moral disposition.
[213:54.28]Do corpses bother you?
[213:55.80]No honorable man should touch them.
[213:57.88]That's the executioner's job.
[213:59.96]Says the guy that was rifling through dead bodies like 40 minutes ago.
[214:05.45]But somewhere else.
[214:07.11]I want to know whether you're going to hide behind some stupid fucking scruples or if you might be useful for more unconventional work.
[214:18.57]Let's do it.
[214:19.10]But that's a bit much.
[214:21.64]But go on.
[214:22.88]Tell me more.
[214:23.74]Listen, it's about this ring my mate Wojtek, the Kohelnitz Miller, had his eye on.
[214:29.82]Trouble is, they buried the ring by the gibbet along with the villain they hung while he was wearing it.
[214:36.39]Jesus Christ.
[214:37.79]You want me to dig up a corpse, take a ring from it, and give it to your friend in Kohelnitz?
[214:42.39]There's nothing sacred to you.
[214:44.23]Money first, morals later.
[214:47.01]That fellow is dead.
[214:48.31]He won't miss it.
[214:49.17]Whenever bleeding heart came up with the idea that it's disrespectful to disturb a court, never read the Bible.
[214:58.24]He's never read the Bible?
[215:00.26]Oh, man.
[215:01.20]Why be disgusted by something created by God?
[215:05.72]I think I've already heard more than I need to know.
[215:08.00]You've got the tongue of the devil himself.
[215:10.48]He tried hard enough.
[215:11.96]Morris later killed this guy.
[215:13.70]Watch your mouth, boy.
[215:16.77]Oh, there's a shovel here.
[215:17.85]Yeah, just look around for the dog.
[215:20.27]Come and see me.
[215:22.37]And here's something on the side to make you dig better.
[215:25.65]Thanks.
[215:26.58]I'll need it.
[215:28.16]I can't believe I've come to this.
[215:30.00]Digging up corpses.
[215:31.44]Oh, and watch out for the executioner and his hounds.
[215:34.88]They're pretty savage.
[215:35.88]He really did.
[215:36.54]And I don't just mean the dogs.
[215:38.85]You can just throw them some meat.
[215:40.61]The dogs, that is.
[215:41.87]But the executioner?
[215:43.59]Well, don't vex him.
[215:47.73]Dammit, I'm hungry.
[215:50.99]Do I have any food or anything?
[215:52.73]Get a spade.
[215:53.47]Dammit, I'm hungry.
[215:59.63]What do we got?
[216:00.09]We have some chicken, right?
[216:01.45]This is rotten.
[216:02.57]Just drop it.
[216:03.59]Wait, no, I'm gonna save it for the dog.
[216:10.35]Apple.
[216:10.69]Save the bread for the dogs.
[216:15.89]44 nourishment.
[216:16.35]We got pretzels.
[216:17.17]Rotten.
[216:21.57]I got some roast, I got some salami.
[216:23.01]Alright, I'm good.
[216:30.58]Get a spade.
[216:36.48]Oh no.
[216:41.81]Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:53.04]Get a spade.
[217:13.64]Spade.
[217:14.32]Spade.
[217:15.00]Spade.
[217:17.16]Spade?
[217:21.40]Spade?
[217:28.88]I just, like, smelt a spade.
[217:33.54]Spade?
[217:43.47]Spade?
[217:48.61]Spade!
[217:53.93]No, don't lockpick.
[218:00.31]What do you mean, put the weapon away?
[218:07.88]Spade?
[218:10.08]Axe?
[218:20.89]Spade over here?
[218:22.25]SPADE!
[218:22.59]Alright, found the hidden object.
[218:28.67]Now let's go.
[218:29.12]Do I get a horse?
[218:31.62]Okay, go to this place and see him or do the get the dead man's ring.
[218:35.73]Go get the dead man's ring.
[218:43.23]Get a spade.
[218:52.10]Horse?
[218:55.00]Horse?
[218:55.30]I'm kidding.
[219:08.77]This is kind of far.
[219:10.29]This is really far.
[219:15.99]I'm doing it first, though.
[219:25.32]Somebody's house?
[219:26.24]Block pick easy?
[219:27.18]No.
[219:28.26]Lots of chickens here.
[219:34.08]Is this trespassing?
[219:35.68]I guess not yet.
[219:37.00]Is it trespassing if I come in and punch a chicken and take it?
[219:40.96]Do you consider that trespassing?
[219:54.55]I can't do it.
[219:59.03]Yes, that is trespassing.
[220:06.10]Uh, is there a road here?
[220:07.08]Where am I going?
[220:11.60]I gotta go up and around.
[220:14.92]Well, this is the wrong way.
[220:19.49]That actually is just sorcery, so we gotta go this way.
[220:21.73]Now we gotta go over here.
[220:29.13]I gotta go all the way around, apparently.
[220:34.43]That means you can cut through the woods.
[220:37.00]Every opportunity where there's been a play, I wasn't able to do it.
[220:47.48]Every obstacle, I was not able to pass every obstacle so far.
[220:55.91]We're just going to go with the guaranteed way.
[221:09.81]Like, can I just cut through the woods?
[221:11.79]Is this an actual obstacle?
[221:14.40]Or can I just walk through?
[221:18.04]I guess you can just walk through the woods.
[221:20.48]I thought those were just trees or a blocker.
[221:22.70]I didn't think you could actually walk through them.
[221:35.79]The game's open, I can just go anywhere I want.
[221:37.25]Alright, well that's good to know.
[221:38.09]Alright, well whatever.
[221:49.10]I'm going this way.
[221:55.62]Almost there.
[221:59.34]Now I'm going to get, like, trapped in the woods.
[222:09.55]I'm almost there.
[222:13.78]Air.
[222:15.68]What, am I climbing on the roof?
[222:22.11]Is something bad in here?
[222:23.59]Do I just dig a corpse up?
[222:25.87]Wait, the guy's dog.
[222:26.61]The guy's dog.
[222:27.09]Dog, dog, dog.
[222:27.89]The guy's dog, right?
[222:30.98]Oh shit, it's coming over here.
[222:32.10]Meat?
[222:33.18]Free meat, right?
[222:36.04]We got some rotten duck.
[222:38.58]Cooked chicken.
[222:50.97]Can I go, like, in the back door or something?
[222:52.29]Does he have a back entrance?
[223:00.17]I'm just like... Alright, there's a back entrance.
[223:03.98]I just heard pig.
[223:11.44]Dog?
[223:11.88]Okay.
[223:14.94]That dog is just kind of sitting there looking at me.
[223:18.31]Line of sight the dog.
[223:22.37]That pig has a bunch of boobs.
[223:25.05]Okay.
[223:25.93]Alright.
[223:26.71]Nice observation, Jeremy.
[223:30.15]Give me a break.
[223:31.03]What a mo- Oh, that's the wrong button.
[223:35.64]Yeah.
[223:43.26]Uh...
[223:52.01]Um, try and get him out of the house?
[223:59.84]Boobs.
[224:00.00]I was going to say it looked like the island of Dr. Moreau.
[224:03.20]Alright, got it.
[224:03.76]See you later, dude.
[224:04.66]Alright, let's now dig it up.
[224:05.96]Where is this
[224:23.57]Right here?
[224:24.43]Where's the X marks the spot here?
[224:26.41]The gallows?
[224:26.98]Where's it at?
[224:34.34]Right here?
[224:36.14]Where's it at?
[224:36.64]Where's it at?
[224:37.22]Where's it at?
[224:37.96]Where's it at?
[224:40.10]Where does it want me to go?
[224:45.16]Like around his house?
[224:46.04]Like the gallows?
[224:48.44]Why would I need to go convince him to leave?
[224:56.86]I don't understand this.
[224:59.60]Why would I tell him to leave?
[225:00.60]Alright, I'm standing in the right spot.
[225:07.01]Where's the spade?
[225:10.25]Where's the spade?
[225:18.07]I have to dig him up, right?
[225:26.20]Um, do I have to, there's like a ring buried here.
[225:37.46]Oh, go to the grave apparently.
[225:42.55]This is painful.
[225:43.55]Yeah, this game is painful.
[225:50.27]Nothing on the left hand.
[225:51.93]The right?
[225:53.82]What do you mean?
[225:55.74]Oh my god.
[225:58.70]Okay.
[226:01.72]So I did this for no reason.
[226:10.63]That's it.
[226:17.15]Go back.
[226:17.85]You should pay Miller Peshik the debt treatment.
[226:19.93]Go back.
[226:21.45]To Peshik.
[226:27.13]I mean, does the executioner have, like, a weapon?
[226:36.82]Steal a bunch of his stuff?
[226:39.92]Oh, get the fuck out of the way.
[226:47.09]Spade.
[226:48.65]Got it.
[226:51.03]Alright, what do you have in here?
[226:56.29]Uh...
[226:58.42]Alright, let's just look in both houses.
[227:01.50]Private area.
[227:02.14]Yep.
[227:04.24]I don't have any lockpicks.
[227:05.11]I can't open that.
[227:08.17]Hopefully he's not storing anything there.
[227:09.73]What about this?
[227:16.30]Oh, what do you got in here?
[227:19.90]No, I'm not gonna kill the dogs.
[227:22.16]No, I don't have any picks.
[227:24.76]What about in his bedroom?
[227:31.14]Alright.
[227:32.68]I'd like to go in the house.
[227:37.37]No, you got cheese in here.
[227:43.87]Rob.
[227:44.25]That's it.
[227:49.57]Make sure nobody sees you steal.
[227:51.61]I don't think they will.
[228:01.47]Anything in your bedroom?
[228:05.58]Can't do anything.
[228:06.34]Yeah, I got the cheese.
[228:09.54]Heist complete.
[228:10.70]I just don't have any, um... Oh, my fucking god.
[228:27.67]Nothing else?
[228:28.11]Can I not take anything else?
[228:37.83]So if the ring's in this house, I can't... God, oh my god.
[228:51.98]Yeah.
[229:08.77]This is definitely better than a D+, guys.
[229:16.33]Oh my god, I can't go through!
[229:33.33]Okay.
[229:35.13]That's fine.
[229:47.92]Yeah, I would like to not be trespassing anymore.
[229:50.16]I swear to God, I would love to not be trespassing.
[229:52.46]Alright, desperate times.
[229:59.52]Hit the door.
[229:59.94]Like, close it.
[230:06.29]Can I close it from here?
[230:07.07]No, I can't.
[230:08.73]That's what I get for stealing.
[230:18.62]Well, I hope he comes back so I can get him rested.
[230:28.81]Okay, I... This one works.
[230:32.19]Maybe it's one of those scenarios where this door has to be closed for this one to work.
[230:38.93]No, what about this one?
[230:39.75]Both doors closed?
[230:40.46]It's like a puzzle game?
[230:47.39]I don't even know where the save is either.
[230:57.47]You.
[230:58.47]Dog.
[230:58.91]Come here, please.
[231:04.78]Somebody.
[231:05.76]Somebody, please help.
[231:06.68]Yes, you.
[231:07.14]Come over here.
[231:09.44]Come over here.
[231:17.32]Uh, can I do a bug report?
[231:25.39]I can fast travel.
[231:26.17]Thank God.
[231:48.80]What if I'm standing outside?
[231:50.50]Technically, I'm not in the house, right?
[232:03.81]Oh, I don't even know what these are.
[232:07.09]Which one is it?
[232:07.77]Which is the right one?
[232:08.63]I don't know.
[232:14.03]No clip through the console.
[232:16.55]Is that going to work?
[232:20.25]Unknown command.
[232:28.31]Oh, almost had it.
[232:31.56]If this guy comes back, he's gonna be real confused.
[232:44.85]Fucking hell.
[232:51.17]Stand in doorway and then close door.
[232:53.65]It should push you out.
[232:54.71]No, I just go back to the other side.
[233:11.98]I did it!
[233:14.71]Okay, thank God.
[233:16.71]Get me out of here.
[233:24.39]Alright, I'm clean.
[233:28.43]Can I fast travel now?
[233:32.70]Thank goodness.
[233:38.22]Talk to him.
[233:39.02]Hey, the ring wasn't there, man.
[233:45.47]Jesus Christ be praised.
[233:49.19]Uh, there was no ring.
[233:50.07]There was a corpse in the grave, but no ring.
[233:51.99]What the fuck is going on?
[233:53.43]Easy, Hal.
[233:54.17]Hold your horses.
[233:55.67]If the ring wasn't on the corpse, the Executioner must have taken it before he... I don't want to go back to that house.
[234:00.83]...see where this is going.
[234:02.29]You want me to get the ring from the Executioner?
[234:04.63]Clever lad.
[234:05.93]Only I wouldn't recommend talking to him about it.
[234:08.75]He's a bit touchy on the subject of robbing the dead.
[234:11.35]He's gonna give me a lockpick?
[234:12.35]It'd be better to pinch it from his house.
[234:18.31]Alright, I'll go and find that ring.
[234:20.47]It should be in a trunk somewhere in the house.
[234:22.91]Look here, Henry.
[234:25.99]Do you know how to get past a lock?
[234:27.55]Do you know how to get past a door?
[234:29.14]You mean jamming it off with a crowbar?
[234:31.66]No, you don't.
[234:33.02]I mean the delicate, gentle art of opening it quietly and with sensitivity.
[234:38.58]Just convince him to give it to me.
[234:39.56]Like popping a young maiden's cherry.
[234:43.70]Ah, I can pick a lock.
[234:44.90]Do you have anything?
[234:48.75]Here's a lockpick.
[234:51.88]I'm just going to do the main storyline right now.
[235:00.20]What is this over here?
[235:02.26]I ain't doing that.
[235:03.66]I don't care.
[235:04.90]This guy can go fuck himself.
[235:08.16]Seriously, this guy can go fuck himself.
[235:09.36]I don't want to do that again.
[235:17.94]I'm here to see Sir Roger.
[235:19.06]Thank you.
[235:19.34]That was the chance at a tutorial.
[235:21.70]Um...
[235:38.79]I have to tell Sir Radzik what happened with his sword.
[235:40.91]I may not look the part, but I know about honor and duty.
[235:44.89]And mine is to tell Sir Radzik what happened to the sword he commissioned.
[235:48.61]Alright, then.
[235:49.29]Go ahead.
[235:50.16]It'll be your skin if Sir Radzik isn't pleased.
[235:54.02]Hey, you're not allowed to walk around here with a weapon drawn.
[235:57.78]Put it away.
[235:58.92]What weapon?
[236:05.57]Oh, wait.
[236:06.63]It's a stick, man.
[236:07.83]Relax.
[236:20.15]I am in a hurry.
[236:21.05]I don't want none of this shit anymore.
[236:25.17]I guess skills.
[236:25.61]You can be good at drinking in this game.
[236:50.78]Overeating that's fine.
[236:52.40]That's my one buff Combat sure.
[236:59.40]Oh my god.
[236:59.98]It's something to get $50 Who gave the 50 bucks I know I'm missing bits the whole stream I'm so sorry guys Thank you cookie though cookie.
[237:11.01]Thanks for the $50 right now.
[237:11.77]I
[237:13.42]Hey, Jerma, it's the happy birthday Nick guy.
[237:16.11]Here's fun so you can refund the game and buy the new theme hospital game so you won't be an unpopular and not cool streamer anymore.
[237:24.89]Thank you, Cookie, for the 50 bucks, dude.
[237:27.99]No, I can't refund this game.
[237:29.69]It's been four hours.
[237:31.99]Then I'm not going to refund the game.
[237:35.51]I can't.
[237:38.43]There's a new one, though.
[237:39.09]That's interesting.
[237:41.55]Thanks a lot, though, though.
[237:42.55]Thanks a lot, though, though.
[237:47.30]Appreciate the $50, dude.
[237:48.58]And happy birthday again, Nick.
[237:50.90]Have a good one.
[237:53.20]Got scammed.
[237:53.92]No, I... Go talk to Roderick.
[238:12.69]Really?
[238:13.19]I'm not even going to say anything.
[238:19.58]Out of the fucking way.
[238:21.84]Don't lockpick.
[238:23.08]No, I want to talk to Roderick.
[238:27.28]Oh, he means he's giving me the refund.
[238:29.76]Okay, I see.
[238:34.68]Where's Roderick?
[238:36.46]He's here somewhere.
[238:37.92]He's in this room.
[238:42.81]Which room is he in?
[238:44.25]Oh, I'm in a private area.
[238:45.35]Hey, who's there?
[238:49.85]I do have a lockpick.
[238:50.75]Don't call him Rodrick anymore.
[238:56.53]Oh, look, there he is.
[238:57.15]Put that weapon away before someone gets hurt.
[239:01.39]Alright, what do you got for me, Tom?
[239:07.39]Talk.
[239:09.40]What do you want?
[239:12.44]God bless you.
[239:13.88]What troubles you?
[239:14.78]Hmm, how, um, how's life?
[239:17.90]Okay, bye.
[239:18.12]No, I wanna, I was trying to sit in his chair.
[239:19.36]Um.
[239:44.40]You don't belong here.
[239:45.48]I know.
[239:49.72]Very hard lockpick.
[239:52.02]Maybe it's out this way?
[239:54.60]I have to go up the stairs further, maybe.
[240:01.02]Like, seriously, you can't even walk up fucking stairs.
[240:04.38]Ooh, don't even say it.
[240:06.60]Not worth it.
[240:12.72]Your graces...
[240:14.67]I have to tell you in all seriousness that this land of ours is in the shit.
[240:21.89]Deep fucking shit.
[240:25.31]Don't you agree?
[240:26.13]I might not have put it as eloquently as you, Hanush, but I've been driven out of my own castle, so I'm hardly going to disagree.
[240:34.66]Indeed.
[240:35.10]But Pirchstein is yours for as long as you need it.
[240:40.49]There's room enough for your men and you here at Ratte, and I'm sure my ward won't have any objection to me lending you his castle.
[240:47.97]I'd be honored.
[240:48.47]Where's Brian Blessed so I can give this game a whole letter grade higher than I already have?
[240:58.58]At any rate, I'm beholden to you, Sir Hans, and to you, Sir Hanush.
[241:02.89]I don't like to speak ill of your people, Sir Radzig, but, well, there's no love lost between the townsfolk and the refugees.
[241:11.78]There's been talk of criminality.
[241:14.54]No, they'll have to get used to it until the situation's resolved.
[241:17.79]But when will it be resolved?
[241:20.21]And what on God's Earth is this all even about?
[241:24.23]I won't lie, sir.
[241:25.49]I don't understand it.
[241:27.44]I'm not going to play Minecraft Hunger Games.
[241:29.42]Be a popular cool streamer already.
[241:30.36]Thank you, Cookie.
[241:44.32]I can't deny the king neglected affairs of state for other pursuits.
[241:48.99]There is a need for order in the land, but I don't think the lords who sided with Sigismund realized just what Hungarian order looks like.
[241:55.79]I'm sorry, this is not an RPG, this is a movie.
[241:59.34]This is a movie that you walk to each scene.
[242:04.93]To give him his due, I don't think he expected the lords of this country to stand behind the king.
[242:09.70]This is a movie.
[242:10.22]Thanks to him, we're tearing ourselves apart, and now he has to get things under control.
[242:14.62]But why in God's name does he have to use those barbarians?
[242:18.44]Money is the root of all evil, young sir.
[242:21.31]Wars are costly, and this one has dragged on for a year.
[242:25.29]You play a role in a movie almost like roleplaying?
[242:28.27]No, I'm watching a guy that's roleplaying in a movie.
[242:33.14]I'm not role-playing.
[242:34.16]I'm watching this guy play the game in a movie.
[242:36.50]This is a History Channel television show.
[242:41.79]So you guys are watching a guy.
[242:43.73]No, no, don't.
[242:45.27]It's important.
[242:46.11]You guys right now are watching a guy on Twitch.
[243:01.82]So you're watching me watch a guy in a game in a movie.
[243:06.56]There's a lot going on here.
[243:08.22]Oh, there you go.
[243:10.80]When you have to, you have to, Radzik.
[243:15.09]Your father was a remarkable man.
[243:17.47]And your mother, she was remarkable too.
[243:21.71]They deserved a Christian burial.
[243:23.03]Did you manage that at least?
[243:25.23]No.
[243:27.07]I was attacked by thieves.
[243:29.49]I wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for that girl.
[243:35.01]The miller's daughter, Theresa.
[243:38.23]The miller's daughter saved you from the footpads?
[243:42.03]Well, there's a tale to tell your children.
[243:44.00]I owe her my life.
[243:45.86]She distracted them and then brought me to Rattay.
[243:48.64]But without a robot, we'd both be dead.
[243:51.30]Well, that's what I call a good woman.
[243:53.16]Hang on to that one, lad.
[243:54.98]Still, it's a great shame your parents are buried in unconsecrated ground.
[244:00.15]That means purgatory for them.
[244:02.18]Be quiet, Friar.
[244:04.20]I didn't invite you here to eat me out of house and home and deliver a sermon while you were doing it.
[244:09.54]If you're so concerned, Father, maybe you should save the innocent souls of these fine Christians yourself.
[244:15.24]Go to Scalitz and consecrate their graves.
[244:17.40]I assure you, if you're killed by Scalitz, your soul will fall straight to hell.
[244:19.72]What's with these guys and consecrating graves and digging up graves?
[244:22.57]As long as someone buries you in consecrated ground first.
[244:25.84]If there's anything left to bury, that plump carcass of yours... Pick up a fucking grave.
[244:30.81]Go bury somebody and dig him up.
[244:32.69]Go dig that guy up.
[244:33.97]And one skeleton looks much like another.
[244:36.55]So how would we know which were your ordained bones or those of Sigismund's tartars?
[244:42.66]Be that as it may, why have you come here?
[244:45.96]I must get your sword back.
[244:47.54]Sword?
[244:48.24]My sword hangs here at my side.
[244:49.76]No, the sword my father forged for you.
[244:52.34]One of those thieves stole it from me.
[244:54.39]Confused by religion.
[244:55.45]Aye.
[245:20.86]The woman had to save his fat from the fire, and now he wants revenge.
[245:24.83]What kind of fool are you, boy?
[245:26.93]He's no fool.
[245:28.87]Henry, you have courage, but you need training, arms, a horse.
[245:33.21]Or do you mean to beat this thief at dice?
[245:35.23]No, sir.
[245:37.05]Please, take me into your service and give me the chance to learn these things.
[245:40.12]The gall of him.
[245:42.00]Fled from the enemy, disobeyed your orders, duped Sir Divish, lost your sword, puts a robot in danger with his actions, and now he wants a promotion.
[245:51.28]So Capon's right.
[245:52.24]It's just blinked.
[245:54.94]Except for fleeing the enemy.
[245:57.32]You would have run as well.
[245:58.98]Believe me.
[246:01.18]Henry's earned some punishment, but how do you punish someone who... It is a very well-written game.
[246:05.58]It's very well-written, very well-acted.
[246:07.66]Courage and blind obedience are good qualities for a soldier, but a wise man also appreciates loyalty.
[246:14.95]This TV show script is great.
[246:16.69]It's very good.
[246:17.93]Besides, that was a fine sword that his father made.
[246:20.84]If he thinks he can get it back, I won't turn it down.
[246:23.90]My lord, he's a peasant.
[246:26.94]You can't make a squire of a peasant.
[246:29.88]Why not?
[246:31.32]Someone made a priest of a pig.
[246:33.96]He isn't a peasant, father.
[246:35.19]He's a blacksmith.
[246:36.21]And recent events have left me in need of his skills.
[246:40.19]So, you'd like to enter my service?
[246:42.93]Sir, I... Yes, I would.
[246:46.13]You won't regret it.
[246:47.79]I probably will.
[246:49.88]I'm doing this for your father, lad.
[246:51.46]Don't disappoint me.
[246:53.34]Oh, fortune has finally smiled on you today, lad.
[246:56.44]This is still the intro.
[246:57.62]Make the most of it.
[246:59.74]Now that I think about it, Sir Hanush, the boy needs training and experience, and you need spear carriers.
[247:06.13]That's true.
[247:07.23]The bailiff is always complaining about your people making trouble in the camp.
[247:11.83]Maybe one of their own among the guard might help.
[247:14.59]It might.
[247:15.87]In any event, it will prove valuable experience.
[247:19.37]Your first job is to find a shovel and go to sleep.
[247:24.52]Captain Bernard, see to his training, and then send him to the bailiff.
[247:29.94]Yes, sir.
[247:31.20]And don't spare him.
[247:34.04]You can rely on it, sir.
[247:35.88]Don't forget, Henry.
[247:37.78]Don't disappoint me.
[247:39.20]Home video.
[247:39.98]I won't, my lord.
[247:42.48]No, why would I skip, like, the best part of the game so far?
[247:54.56]Okay.
[248:05.23]Go to the training ground and talk- Okay, let's go to the training ground.
[248:07.93]That's probably a good idea.
[248:10.52]That's kind of far away, but we can fast travel right there.
[248:21.55]Oh, do I have to wait to... I'm going to sleep in somebody's random bed.
[248:29.74]Can I sleep on the ground?
[248:46.45]I'm standing outside the castle for four hours.
[248:50.53]I'm ready.
[248:56.50]Okay.
[248:59.48]Let me go to my skills.
[249:03.82]I've just been getting rained on.
[249:05.01]Alright, player skills.
[249:09.05]So how do you put a point in?
[249:10.39]I guess just press that.
[249:16.87]Hunting.
[249:17.83]Lockpicking.
[249:19.82]Reading.
[249:22.68]Let's take a look at the info here.
[249:25.80]Reading.
[249:27.04]Influences the ability of your character to actually read books.
[249:30.30]Alright, pretty literal.
[249:34.77]Why would you need to read books?
[249:38.47]Maintenance.
[249:38.85]Lockpicking.
[249:39.35]Hunting.
[249:43.07]Drinking.
[249:46.34]um I kind of I can't do bow mace sword I already have two let's let's go let's just go sword what do I have right now mace main level two yeah
[250:16.35]I could do... Should I do archery?
[250:18.24]Would that be fun?
[250:25.98]I should put points into reading.
[250:27.30]I feel like I should just do strength.
[250:36.77]Or... Maybe not.
[250:44.17]I'll just do strength.
[250:46.26]Gravedigger.
[250:50.13]Carrying dead or unconscious bodies won't cost you any stamina.
[250:54.49]Gives you a one-third higher chance of overpowering your opponent in a clinch.
[250:59.17]Blocking an opponent's blows will cost you less stamina.
[251:02.74]You can carry 15 more pounds.
[251:06.18]Okay.
[251:09.24]Vitality.
[251:09.82]Marathon.
[251:10.52]Man, you run slower, but you keep it up for longer.
[251:15.17]You run faster, but tire faster.
[251:18.51]You bleed slower.
[251:21.59]Okay.
[251:24.49]You can dispel your hunger with anything.
[251:26.15]You won't suffer from eating poisoned or spoiled food, but neither will have any positive effects.
[251:29.71]Does not apply to alcohol.
[251:31.05]Okay.
[251:33.93]Let's just go.
[251:34.45]What is main level?
[251:38.70]First aid 1.
[251:40.54]Manly odor.
[251:41.38]What?
[251:43.38]What?
[251:45.97]reduces my stealth skill alright let's just do this let's do I feel like this is a good idea I have to do it everyone's saying I have to do that alright well why would I do this who cares
[252:15.36]Isn't that bad?
[252:19.68]Increases the time you can do without sleep.
[252:22.86]I kind of like that.
[252:23.52]I don't even know what the correct thing to do here is.
[252:37.97]I'm going to probably just do these.
[252:41.43]Or... Let's do Mule.
[252:44.18]Mule.
[252:48.45]So I have... I can do some Vitality.
[252:51.87]We'll do Sprinter.
[252:53.37]No, Marathon Man.
[252:55.19]I like that.
[252:58.57]Thick-blooded, balanced diet.
[253:01.83]If you don't either overeat or go hungry for five days, you get a plus one bonus on Vitality and Agility.
[253:07.43]I go with the Bleed.
[253:21.28]Still can do this.
[253:23.02]I like Insomniac.
[253:28.30]Agility.
[253:29.14]I don't want to do Manly.
[253:33.74]Stamina will generate 20% faster at night.
[253:40.27]Evading by 10%.
[253:41.27]Let's try that.
[253:47.31]Okay.
[253:48.03]Combat.
[253:48.35]Warfare.
[253:49.69]Warfare.
[253:51.65]You have a greater chance of drawing your opponent's blood.
[253:53.49]The more damage to your sword, the greater your chance of poisoning your opponent when you hit them.
[253:58.81]I like the blood one.
[254:02.65]We got sword.
[254:04.01]Blunt strike.
[254:05.73]So this is like a little combo.
[254:09.04]Stab slash slash.
[254:10.10]Instead of a started strike from the right, strike unexpectedly at your opponent's face.
[254:15.90]Okay, so that's a combo.
[254:19.06]Slash slash stab.
[254:24.05]Double stab.
[254:27.90]Quick thrusts.
[254:38.34]What can you do to get me to change games?
[254:42.52]I mean, I'm probably going to be done streaming here in like a little bit.
[254:49.08]I might give this game another chance tomorrow or the next day.
[254:53.44]Because I feel like we're at the point where it's probably worth playing now.
[255:00.04]Let's go with this one.
[255:02.55]Or, uh, no, this one.
[255:05.63]Let's get a good long sword.
[255:07.11]We can do another one, too.
[255:13.01]Let's do this double stab as well.
[255:14.36]I have no other things I can do.
[255:29.54]Alright.
[255:30.90]It's time for bed.
[255:34.32]Both literally and figuratively.
[255:41.77]It's a decent game behind the annoying flaws.
[255:43.49]I know.
[255:44.35]You guys know that whenever I... Whenever I get stuck or frustrated or something, I just talk shit.
[255:51.37]And not even real.
[255:53.30]I know this game is actually worth playing.
[255:55.44]It's just got a 68 on Metacritic.
[255:58.18]Which is a D+.
[255:58.80]I mean, then that's just... That's just a fact.
[256:05.27]That's not me.
[256:06.13]That's not me saying that.
[256:07.37]That's me reading a website that compiles reviews.
[256:16.72]Let's just go camp.
[256:18.60]Let's see, where do we go?
[256:22.70]It's so dark.
[256:23.30]Do I have a torch?
[256:29.88]I do.
[256:34.31]It's... I'm kidding.
[256:35.89]I'm just kidding.
[256:49.41]Can I just sleep in somebody's house?
[256:51.71]Is it trespassing if they don't know you're in there?
[257:00.21]Where's a bed?
[257:04.93]Maybe I should just fast... Is there like a... Where's my bed?
[257:10.33]There is a bed thing over here.
[257:12.43]Let's just go here.
[257:13.11]I'm just sleeping here.
[257:16.47]Oh god, it's going to take me like five hours.
[257:18.54]It's going to take me until morning to get there.
[257:19.88]I'm going to be a day sleeper.
[257:24.77]Probably should not have gone this far.
[257:26.03]Alright, time for bed.
[257:33.54]It's almost morning.
[257:35.28]I'm gonna go sleep for 20 minutes.
[257:39.26]Goodnight.
[257:43.90]Bye-bye.
[257:49.56]Okay, running the haystack.
[257:55.34]There we go.
[258:00.02]How much are they paying you to promote the game?
[258:03.74]Have you been here?
[258:05.73]If you call this promoting the game, then I would... My contract would get ripped in half if that was the case.
[258:27.11]I would lose that gig in a second.
[258:36.28]Alright, let me go... Alright, I think I'm at a stopping point here where I want to take a break.
[258:44.71]I think I'm gonna probably stream tomorrow.
[258:48.79]If I don't stream tomorrow, then we'll start early again on Tuesday.
[258:55.58]I feel like I need to sleep and refresh.
[258:58.40]But.
[258:59.94]But.
[259:03.68]Calm back.
[259:04.14]I know.
[259:04.46]Don't worry.
[259:04.78]Don't worry.
[259:08.41]No, no, no, no.
[259:10.09]What do you mean no?
[259:17.31]The quota has not been met.
[259:20.07]Just when he starts the best part.
[259:21.87]Yeah, I need like a break.
[259:24.87]I really do.
[259:25.53]I'm honest with you guys.
[259:29.24]I've only been streaming for like four and a half hours, but... I... I need to take a moment.
[259:43.54]We will continue this game probably either tomorrow or Tuesday.
[259:45.88]And we'll start early.
[259:46.66]If I don't stream tomorrow, we'll start early on Tuesday so I can get another good like four plus five plus hour stream.
[259:55.55]I need a break from complaining and missing the point of the game.
[259:59.63]You're probably right, but this is not what I thought the game was going to be.
[260:05.75]And I'll be honest.
[260:15.94]But, anyways, I have something new here.
[260:23.51]Yeah, that's on me, and that's fine.
[260:26.93]But, thanks for sticking around tonight.
[260:33.73]Actually, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[260:34.71]We don't do that.
[260:35.33]We don't do that.
[260:35.81]We're going to do this.
[260:38.32]Where is it?
[260:39.90]Hey, look at that.
[260:40.48]Look at that little corner thing.
[260:41.82]And let's see if this works.
[260:43.68]Are you ready?
[260:45.54]Let's see if it works.
[260:47.60]Did it work?
[260:50.36]Hey, look at that, it shows everybody that gave bits.
[260:54.11]And it's going way too fast.
[260:56.95]Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[260:58.53]It should say that subs should show up here.
[261:01.59]How do I go slower?
[261:06.65]Alright, here they got it.
[261:07.39]Here are tonight's subs.
[261:08.45]Thanks, everybody, for subbing.
[261:10.03]It's going too fast.
[261:12.15]But there's a lot.
[261:13.21]I can't even read the names.
[261:14.48]Because it's going too fucking fast.
[261:15.78]Because I fucked it up somehow.
[261:17.18]But thank you, everybody.
[261:18.50]All you guys that subbed.
[261:20.72]There you go.
[261:21.50]And look at Jarvis Short.
[261:22.72]Remember that guy?
[261:23.46]Remember he subbed earlier?
[261:24.52]There's a lot of subscriptions tonight.
[261:26.98]What the fuck?
[261:30.09]What?
[261:30.73]It's not stopping.
[261:35.15]Uh... Were there really this many subscriptions tonight?
[261:40.92]I don't... Are you sure this is not just every single one of my subscribers?
[261:51.35]Not just tonight?
[261:57.11]This is supposed to be... It's every single subscriber.
[262:02.09]No, it's not.
[262:06.33]Well, well, well, we'll... Uh, the credits are gonna go all night.
[262:13.09]That was supposed to be slower so I could read them.
[262:16.55]Um... Hey, look, can we do that again?
[262:20.41]I have to retroactively.
[262:27.69]That was, that was a lot.
[262:32.40]Okay, so here's the thing.
[262:34.08]They just came out with that, I think like a few days ago.
[262:38.68]Less than like a couple days ago, so that'll... it's gonna be there.
[262:42.32]I'm gonna add to it, but that's... Let's roll the credits again.
[262:46.52]Why not?
[262:46.80]Just so we can see it again.
[262:49.56]Hey, look at that.
[262:50.16]Here they come.
[262:58.22]Hey, remember those names?
[263:02.01]Cutting edge technology.
[263:07.03]Put all your sub money in the stock market.
[263:12.18]It's still going too fast.
[263:13.62]Hey, look at you.
[263:14.14]Okay, Aquatic Toaster, let me touch your butt.
[263:15.62]Lord, I can't do it.
[263:16.36]It's too fast.
[263:18.44]Speed read it.
[263:19.36]I'll slow it down for next time.
[263:23.08]But seriously, thank you guys.
[263:24.48]If they're really with this many subs tonight and resubs and shit, that's a lot.
[263:31.91]it's the credits of the movie it came out a month ago this was not on my I use stream labs and this was not an option that I could select like two days ago so but regardless sorry this is a Jeremy sucks at everything stream happens sometimes and I just complain about it but
[264:01.43]I'm like rubbing my whole face right now And with that now we can go over here With that let's go down here I'm what I'm fully what I
[264:33.23]The game has a lot of problems, but it's just... I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in it today.
[264:38.49]I'll probably stream, like, tomorrow or something.
[264:44.33]If I don't, then I'll say the same thing five times now.
[264:48.21]I'll stream on Tuesday for, like, two, three hours early.
[264:53.86]But, thank you so much, Bitwise.
[264:56.96]Let's go with Gary.
[264:57.74]Great, thanks for the $1.
[264:58.42]Delayed streamer.
[264:59.60]I started at, like, 5.30.
[265:00.06]What are you talking about, man?
[265:03.15]WitchFever, thanks for the $1.
[265:04.39]How's your mother doing?
[265:05.43]Uh, Jerma, she's doing great.
[265:07.81]She's getting close to being... I would say, uh, to a B+.
[265:14.94]Is there a time I would stream tomorrow?
[265:17.16]Probably not at the same time.
[265:18.02]It's during the day.
[265:22.82]Hmm.
[265:23.70]But my mother's doing great.
[265:24.72]Thanks a lot.
[265:25.10]I appreciate it.
[265:27.34]Huckside, thanks for the $5.
[265:28.46]Any ETA for the next main channel video?
[265:32.07]Uh...
[265:35.33]I bet you can't say this five times in a row.
[265:38.79]Um, no.
[265:39.99]I don't want to say that.
[265:41.19]I don't want to say anything five times fast, because I don't know what I'm saying, so no.
[265:44.39]Thank you, though.
[265:46.92]I... Well, here's the thing.
[265:50.38]There's a couple of videos that are not going to be videos.
[265:52.90]They're going to be streams, but they're going to be videos at the same time.
[265:56.98]There's like two or three things that I just need to get in there.
[266:02.06]So, like, the main channel video, there's going to be some adaptation to it being like a broadcasted live show, essentially.
[266:16.33]Now, you'll see what I mean when it happens.
[266:17.67]I'm not going to tell you exactly what's going to happen or when it's going to happen, but it'll just be there and you'll see it.
[266:27.45]But I guess that's the answer for now.
[266:33.75]No, this is not pre-recorded.
[266:35.19]This is going to be just a live, in quotes, show.
[266:40.08]Where there's people that are there.
[266:42.68]It's broadcasted live.
[266:44.12]There's no pre-recorded stuff.
[266:46.11]But we'll see how it goes.
[266:49.81]Thank you to Morgan Freeman.
[266:51.09]Thank you so much, dude, for the 25 cents.
[266:52.65]That's all they say is cheer 25.
[266:55.35]Darkstar7000, thanks for the $1.
[266:57.13]Call Comcast on stream and tell them how shitty their service is and threaten to stop paying for their shitty service.
[267:01.22]Works for my grandma every time.
[267:03.84]Now they'll just turn me off.
[267:05.14]They'll be like, okay, sorry to hear that, sir.
[267:11.38]Thank you Private Tickles for the $1.
[267:14.12]They just say cheer.
[267:15.68]Thank you.
[267:19.40]Thank you Comcast Customer Care for the $1.
[267:21.22]I saw a mud crab the other day.
[267:22.58]Disgusting creatures.
[267:25.66]What?
[267:27.38]What does that mean?
[267:30.69]Thanks for the $1.
[267:31.39]Thank you Kill Ganon for the $1.
[267:32.79]The game has fantastic combat stories, characters, and environments.
[267:35.91]It also has a lot of shitty bugs.
[267:37.99]Hope you stick it out through the grit and see the great game underneath.
[267:40.87]Love you, Jeremy.
[267:43.47]I'm sure it's there, but... I don't know.
[267:51.56]Appreciate it, though.
[267:52.62]I'll give it another attempt.
[267:53.75]I will.
[267:54.35]I'll give it a real solid attempt.
[267:55.85]Again.
[267:58.41]Thank you, Witch Fever, for the $1.
[267:59.47]Well, I said that already.
[268:04.71]Thank you, Mitchell256, for the $5.
[268:06.63]Good luck, dude.
[268:07.15]Comcast fucking sucks and hates their clients.
[268:10.35]Sorry, you have to deal with that.
[268:11.21]I'm not even sure it's that.
[268:13.73]It's... There's just too many customers and they have terrible infrastructure.
[268:19.95]That's pretty much it.
[268:24.06]Comcast has just... Everybody around here has Comcast, and they've never updated their nodes or their infrastructure, so it's just a bunch of garbage.
[268:32.44]And then, like, thousands of people connect to the same shitty un- not upgraded node, and it just doesn't work sometimes and breaks.
[268:43.83]But, yeah, that's the way it is.
[268:46.80]Thank you, Rennex, for the $1.
[268:48.90]You can only quicksave with a specific item.
[268:50.68]Might want to look into the add-on that allows unlimited saves.
[268:57.15]Um, no, I think I'll be okay.
[268:59.56]At least for like another streamer, maybe.
[269:01.08]We'll try it.
[269:02.84]Hashy Hashbrowns, thanks for the five dollars.
[269:05.36]Fred Flintstone, thanks for the one dollar.
[269:06.94]Something tells me this may not be a game for you, Mr. Bookworm.
[269:11.02]I don't think it is.
[269:12.28]I really don't.
[269:14.91]I really just don't do well at games that are like a hundred plus hours long for the main storyline and have huge, huge, huge cutscene and story heavy content.
[269:29.43]Because, like, just even break down, like, what we just did, right?
[269:33.23]Forget about, like, if I, like, missed a couple things or I fucked up and went the wrong way or something, right?
[269:37.69]There were maybe two or three pieces of, like, actual video game content where you went and you attacked somebody or you had to go, like, do a task.
[269:49.14]The rest was actually just watching a TV show.
[269:56.35]So I usually don't care very much for games that are like that.
[270:00.55]I understand why people do, because it can be fun to do that.
[270:07.38]And I have heard that just play the game for five hours and then it'll be fun.
[270:13.20]But man, is it hard for me to do that shit, though.
[270:15.81]How is it bad?
[270:17.87]It's not bad, it's just that's not... It just takes too long to get started.
[270:22.25]That's what happens in a lot of these games.
[270:24.78]It takes like a solid 10 hours to like start the video game.
[270:32.66]So I dislike games with cutscenes.
[270:34.04]Oh, that's not true.
[270:43.21]Just wait a few weeks?
[270:44.05]What, for like patches?
[270:51.87]Did a shit ton of bass just show up on the audio?
[270:53.65]I don't know.
[270:54.33]I don't think so.
[271:08.70]I don't want to dog the game.
[271:13.61]There just wasn't much going on.
[271:22.56]But, it's all good.
[271:25.86]We do it another day.
[271:26.70]Sounds like a furnace turned on.
[271:31.47]Yeah, it probably did.
[271:32.01]The furnace is right here.
[271:35.65]But, thank you ComcastCustomerCare for the $1.
[271:38.33]Kunash for the next Jerm or Rumble.
[271:41.78]I don't think so.
[271:45.62]WhateverAvenue, thanks for the $3.
[271:47.94]For when you quit streaming...
[271:55.53]I'm just done with... No, I didn't say I was going to quit streaming.
[271:57.85]I said I was going to quit playing video games.
[271:59.91]I said I was going to quit video games.
[272:03.65]And it was just a jokey, knee-jerk, listen to how crazy this is.
[272:08.70]I never said I was going to stop streaming.
[272:11.64]I said I was going to quit video games.
[272:20.00]Thank you, SuperSeal, for the $1.
[272:21.42]RIP the VOD audio.
[272:27.59]Thanks, dude.
[272:29.13]Thank you and Adam for the 50 cents.
[272:30.99]Uh, Jesus Christ almighty.
[272:33.25]Oh, fucking mighty.
[272:33.93]In heaven and hell, but in the kingdom come that will be done.
[272:36.53]Now it is in heaven.
[272:37.33]Give us this taste of our silly red.
[272:38.85]Don't trespass into anybody's quarters.
[272:41.25]What is this?
[272:44.30]Oh, I think, oh, I said that earlier.
[272:45.64]Oh, I said that like a week ago.
[272:48.62]Thanks, dude.
[272:51.70]No, I wouldn't, it's not IRL content.
[272:53.48]I'm not gonna just walk around like a shopping mall.
[272:58.18]What are you talking about?
[273:04.89]Blue-footed newbie, thanks for the 25 cents.
[273:07.81]Your hands are still covered in shit.
[273:09.41]They were the whole time.
[273:15.53]Vlog on a beach.
[273:19.75]Benjamin, thanks for the 25 cents.
[273:23.27]Moo means moo, thanks for the one dollar.
[273:24.56]Hey, you guys.
[273:25.24]Henry, son of a blacksmith.
[273:28.39]super seal thanks for the 25 cents when will you play metro 2033 or whatever it was called again that was last light redux uh it's just on the cards I don't know sometimes just happens where like I I get in a game and I it's just very clearly not going the way that I intended
[273:53.06]And then I got nothing else, like, planned.
[273:55.18]And I have to still do that thing.
[273:57.02]Otherwise, what am I gonna do?
[273:58.20]Go walk around a shopping mall?
[274:03.86]It happens sometimes.
[274:04.94]It happens, like, once or twice a month.
[274:07.18]Maybe, like, once a month.
[274:08.40]Once you'll see a stream like that.
[274:16.34]You sound depressed.
[274:17.56]No.
[274:19.04]I'm just tired.
[274:19.90]I'm just really fucking tired lately for some dumb reason.
[274:26.67]But, Chojiboy, thanks for the $27.50.
[274:29.15]Appreciate it.
[274:33.07]Why does your character look like the doctor who worked in the morgue on Scrubs?
[274:37.25]We're not talking about... What's his name?
[274:42.80]Zach Braff?
[274:44.48]That's not him, right?
[274:49.78]Zachary Braff.
[274:51.30]Thank you, Chojiboy, for the almost $30 here.
[274:53.02]Appreciate it, dude.

[275:19.91]Kingdom Come Funeral Simulator.
[275:23.13]I do feel like we woke up like... We woke up... How many times did you wake up in the first four hours of this game?
[275:29.79]Like, oh, I'm awake in a bed.
[275:31.27]That happened like seven times.
[275:34.30]Something like that.
[275:37.00]Notable Dom, thanks for the $1.
[275:38.50]Don't let chat get to you, Jeremy, my sweet baby boy.
[275:42.24]Chat wasn't getting to me, it was... Me getting to me.
[275:47.36]And the game getting to me.
[275:51.81]Uh, Maisykit, thanks for the $1, you give me this, this link, I don't even know what this is, I'm not clicking any links that are like random images.
[275:58.85]Appreciate it though, thank you.
[276:03.95]Uh, Maisykit, again, thanks for the $1, your female viewership is up because a couple of my gal pals started watching your videos after I showed them some of my favorites.
[276:15.14]Thanks, I hope, hopefully you didn't send me a virus earlier, Maisy.
[276:17.94]Appreciate it though, dude.
[276:19.92]Gal pals though, okay.
[276:23.45]Are you a gal, pal, as well?
[276:28.04]Sir Feline, thanks for the 50 cents.
[276:29.32]Murders person.
[276:30.58]This was worth it.
[276:31.32]This was worth it.
[276:31.98]Jeremy.
[276:32.42]1420 AD.
[276:36.84]It's earlier than that.
[276:40.43]It was a pic of Garfield.
[276:41.55]Why are you sending me pictures of Garfield?
[276:44.53]It's banned.
[276:47.42]Son of a Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[276:48.64]Hey, Jeremy, I wish I could donate 50 or 100 gazillion bits like some people do, but every dollar is very expensive in my country.
[276:54.01]Love ya.
[276:56.29]Son of Jenova, this is not a competition.
[277:01.57]You don't have to compare yourself to people that have given me hundreds if not thousands of dollars over the last year.
[277:07.88]Not a race, not a competition.
[277:10.62]I appreciate every cent and every view.
[277:13.78]Thank you, dude.
[277:14.80]Don't worry about it.
[277:18.74]Yes, it is.
[277:19.28]No, is it not?
[277:19.72]What are you talking about?
[277:22.08]You are a gal pal.
[277:24.07]The picture is just a goofy drawing of Garfield.
[277:25.81]I remember a funny video of yours when you were censoring Garfield.
[277:28.85]Alright, well, I'll have to open it then.
[277:32.85]And I probably should start calling you dude from now on.
[277:34.85]Probably should start calling you gal pal.
[277:40.89]Thanks, though.
[277:43.39]Uh, we also have... Mmm...
[277:48.47]I fell 30 stories out this window a week ago.
[277:52.41]And it was a miraculous feat that I was able to not die.
[277:55.67]I was able to survive.
[277:56.63]Need proof.
[277:57.39]Me being here alive is proof.
[278:15.85]But thank you, E-word.
[278:16.91]Word, E-word, word.
[278:18.39]Appreciate it.
[278:19.81]Ten bucks.
[278:22.33]Uh, Grizzly1620, thanks for the one dollar.
[278:24.24]Hey, my man.
[278:24.68]I hope life is treating you well lately.
[278:25.92]I've been feeling blah and sad and sleeping a lot.
[278:29.34]Anyways, I love you, man.
[278:30.28]Hanging out, watching the stream always lifts my spirits.
[278:35.00]Thanks a lot, Grizzly.
[278:36.64]Um, I hope life is treating you well.
[278:40.86]I hope you feel better.
[278:43.95]I've been there, I've been there.
[278:45.05]Sometimes you just, look, sometimes you just fucking feel like shit.
[278:48.73]It happens to everybody.
[278:52.87]It happens to me, right?
[278:54.15]Like I, sometimes I get up and I'm just like, I don't fucking want to do anything.
[278:58.27]And sometimes, that happens like on a stream.
[279:03.09]Everybody can get like that.
[279:04.61]It's just how you end up dealing with it and moving forward, right?
[279:11.40]Like, for instance, today.
[279:14.22]Played this game called Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[279:17.08]I, like, woke up in a kind of a bland mood, and... Just fucking called the game a D+, and, like, pissed off 3,000 people.
[279:24.69]And... Walked around in a circle, and got angry.
[279:32.61]And I'm just sitting in a bathrobe, like an old-school comic book sick person with a thermometer hanging out of their mouth, and their feet in water, with a robe on.
[279:47.56]but um sorry you're feeling that way grizzly hope that you start feeling better thank you e word works each word again for the one dollar do it uh alright I've did it e word words you swear it's worth again one dollar webcam out window I'm not gonna do that why would I why even if I didn't live 30 stories up that will up the webcam I don't want to do that
[280:16.66]Samuel Sish, thanks for the one dollar, I was playing this game recently and came up with a shit 15th century joke.
[280:22.90]Alright, let's hear it, here we go.
[280:25.26]A lord rides down from his castle to shop around town.
[280:29.55]He goes to the tailor and gets a new jacket and stops for a pint at the tavern.
[280:33.87]On his way back, he rides his horse past the tanner.
[280:36.89]The lord asks the tanner, can you make my horse some shoes?
[280:41.75]What?
[280:42.01]I don't get it.
[280:42.61]I don't understand.
[280:43.31]What's the joke?
[281:18.06]Make the horse some sh- it's a- Horse equals shoes.
[281:21.32]Oh.
[281:23.28]Oh, I get it.
[281:26.46]EWortWortyTwerchWort gave two dollars in a row here and says, eat your webcam.
[281:31.36]Webcam out the window or eat it.
[281:33.11]Eat webcam.
[281:34.01]What is- no!
[281:34.99]What are you- what are you doing?
[281:38.57]Why would I eat my fucking webcam?
[281:40.77]Why would I throw my webcam out the window?
[281:42.31]We've gone over this.
[281:47.67]Moo beans moo thanks for the $1 stop eluding the butcher you piece of shit murders the looter and loots the body thinking Forgive you because you are also very thick says super seal Thank you, I guess smelly boy 11 thanks to the $1 actually call Etalyx and ask for help it'll be funny I
[282:15.07]No, no, I just wanted to swing my sword at stuff and go on quests.
[282:19.81]I did not get frustrated in a video game tonight, but that happened.
[282:25.89]CookieCRM gave the $50 earlier.
[282:28.29]Thank you again.
[282:29.53]Happy birthday, Nick.
[282:33.99]Thank you to Captain Protagonist for the $5.
[282:36.65]Any chance for another Subnautica or Monster Hunter stream?
[282:39.41]Those are some of the funniest and relaxing streams to work to.
[282:44.45]I've actually... We're almost at the end of Monster Hunter.
[282:47.91]I've been playing it off-stream.
[282:50.03]We've gotten to the point where you... I don't want to say it, but... We're nearly, I believe, at the end of the story line of Monster Hunter: World.
[283:01.37]I decided a long time ago that we were going to just play it off-stream.
[283:05.57]It's a lot easier that way, I think, for me to just do it off-stream.
[283:12.93]Plus, Monster Hunter can get kind of grindy and... On stream, it's... I don't know if I would want to do that on stream.
[283:23.99]But, thank you though, dude.
[283:24.79]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[283:26.19]I'm sorry that the game's plentiful bugs have been a nuisance, but hey, at least it's not Die Hard for the PS1.
[283:32.61]It really wasn't even the bugs that were causing me problems, it was just... It was just very slow.
[283:40.66]But that's alright.
[283:42.60]Thank you Elroy for the $1, Elroy21.
[283:45.88]Intro's about two hours of movie then it turns into Skyrim bugs and all.
[283:52.76]Interesting.
[283:54.80]Nightfangx7, thanks for the $1.
[283:56.56]Jerma, what do you do on your off days when you're not streaming?
[283:59.66]Um... Sometimes, a whole lot of nothing unless I'm working on something else.
[284:05.86]Believe it or not, a lot of times off stream, I'm trying to figure out something else to do on stream.
[284:13.23]So the number one reason why I don't stream every day doesn't have to do with the fact that I don't like want to is just if I have to stream every single day or like five or six days a week, I can't like come up with stuff to do on the other streams.
[284:33.62]I kind of have to just pick something and just do it and just that's what I do.
[284:40.33]Especially considering a lot of the stuff that's being worked on now for this year.
[284:48.43]Thinking about jumping off cliff jokes?
[284:49.85]Yeah, it takes a while.
[284:57.72]It does take a while to come up with those.
[285:01.12]I am not done with YouTube.
[285:02.24]They're going to be blended together.
[285:04.97]You'll understand what I mean when the first thing happens.
[285:08.95]If that makes any sense.
[285:13.34]Thank you to... Ewert.
[285:16.02]Thanks for the $1.
[285:17.10]Again, window camera.
[285:21.65]No.
[285:22.31]I'm not turning my webcam on.
[285:23.23]It's not gonna happen.
[285:25.65]Sergeant Jetstream, thanks for the $5.
[285:26.95]They say, I know the intro sucks, but the game really picks up in a quest or two.
[285:31.70]Please don't quit.
[285:33.66]No, we're gonna give it another attempt.
[285:35.28]We're gonna do another full stream of Kingdom Come either tomorrow or Tuesday.
[285:39.64]I promise.
[285:40.69]I promise.
[285:43.71]Thank you for the $5.
[285:46.22]Crunchy Jester, thanks for the $1.
[285:47.67]It wasn't until I became president that I realized, well, Bill Clinton wrote that.
[285:50.81]He wrote the J. That's interesting.
[285:52.91]George W. Bush wrote, return the slab.
[285:59.88]Um... Three times during your sentence, somebody, like, hit you in the head with a hammer.
[286:11.76]It was like... No, it was like changing the channels.
[286:14.63]Like three times during that, I changed the channel on your sentence.
[286:18.83]It wasn't until I became president that I... Bill Clinton wrote that.
[286:21.77]He wrote the J. That's interesting.
[286:23.67]George W. Bush wrote return.
[286:25.31]Return the slap.
[286:29.92]I was watching a bunch of different TV shows there.
[286:32.52]I have skillage thanks to the 25 cents.
[286:33.64]Appreciate it.
[286:36.10]Moo means moo thanks to the $1.
[286:37.32]Send love from all of us to Mama Jerm.
[286:38.76]Glad to hear she's doing well.
[286:39.62]Looking forward to tomorrow's stream.
[286:44.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[286:45.09]Thank you.
[286:45.61]I will.
[286:48.93]Thanks a lot, Moo.
[286:49.37]You don't have to feel badly for having preferences, though.
[286:55.14]We still give you bits.
[287:13.11]Yeah, it's... I hate to, like, fucking talk shit about something that somebody likes.
[287:19.81]Because it's not a bad experience, it's just an experience that I don't necessarily like to do.
[287:26.33]But, you know.
[287:30.39]Thank you, MrFancy24, for the $1.50.
[287:32.61]I have leftover bits, but no joke or silly comment to say.
[287:37.35]I would gladly take them if you want to give them to me.
[287:39.47]Thank you for the $1.50.
[287:44.45]Uh, anal weapon, thanks for the one dollar.
[287:46.17]You should use an audio limiter, buddy.
[287:53.38]So, when I do this, it doesn't get really loud and horrible?
[288:00.62]Triple chin Jupiter.
[288:04.58]You know, actually, probably I'm gonna get, like, an equalizer.
[288:08.81]The thing I have is supposed to do that, and it just doesn't.
[288:10.81]It sucks.
[288:12.93]So we'll try it.
[288:13.47]Maybe I'll do that like this next weekend or something if I have enough cash to get it.
[288:17.73]I'll give it a go.
[288:22.80]Mr. Fancy, thanks for the $1.50.
[288:24.26]Also, I hope Jerma Mom is doing better.
[288:26.80]Thank you.
[288:27.22]She is.
[288:30.56]Mad Ninja, thanks for the $1.00.
[288:32.16]Hey, hee hee.
[288:35.06]Appreciate the hee hees.
[288:38.91]Samuel Sish, thanks for the $1.00 here.
[288:41.57]Also, I told my co-worker that I pay you money, and he couldn't understand why I would want to pay some dude who plays games online.
[288:47.43]Then I showed him Jerma Rumble live action, and he couldn't stop laughing.
[288:51.74]And then you point, and you point, and you point at the screen, and you hit the screen, and you go like, See?
[288:55.24]See?
[288:55.78]This is why!
[288:57.06]This is why I do it!
[288:58.34]And he's like, Alright, man, I get it!
[288:59.66]Fine!
[288:59.92]And he takes out his wallet.
[289:02.10]He's like, Where do I go?
[289:02.84]Where do I go to put the credit card in?
[289:03.92]Where do I go?
[289:05.08]And all of a sudden, like, do-doong!
[289:07.38]Thank you, uh, dave1191 for the $25.
[289:11.77]And I'm like, yeah, gimme, gimme!
[289:22.68]I'm kidding, I'm kidding, it's a joke.
[289:26.74]Thank you, thank you, uh, demilkmaster for the $1.
[289:31.32]Play Garfield's cart.
[289:32.36]Fuck Garfield.
[289:42.63]Gimme Dave 1191.
[289:54.05]Controversy?
[289:54.77]What are you talking about?
[289:58.52]I bet you would.
[290:01.02]Local streamer hates Garfield.
[290:02.28]None of you guys like Garfield.
[290:03.50]Why are you telling me this?
[290:06.80]Have a good night, everybody.
[290:08.94]We'll try again Tuesday, probably.
[290:12.45]Just assume that Tuesday I'm going to start early.
[290:15.58]By an hour or two, and we'll do the same thing we did today.
[290:25.16]Wait, I skipped your glue joke.
[290:26.58]Where is it?
[290:26.94]What are you talking about?
[290:30.66]Where's your glue joke?
[290:39.27]Oh, here it is, okay.
[290:40.59]It's the one thing I missed over.
[290:41.79]My favorite brand of glue is probably... I mean rubber cement is like fun to play with.
[290:45.25]If you take rubber cement and you coat it all over your hand, and you let it dry for a little bit,
[291:08.10]After about, I don't know, maybe five minutes, it becomes this crazy, super, you can peel it off your hand.
[291:15.14]It's almost like a hand mask.
[291:16.24]It's crazy.
[291:18.22]Don't eat it, though.
[291:18.80]Don't eat that.
[291:20.29]Don't do that.
[291:21.29]That's bad for you.
[291:23.53]Anyways, good night, everybody.
[291:25.83]I'll see you soon.
[291:27.97]Right at the very end, Lelwen gave a dollar.

[291:42.31]Enjoy the rest, you know
[292:07.05]Thank you.
[292:41.93]Thank you.
