[ve:60.16.100]

[00:44.09]Wait, what?
[00:45.09]Hey.
[00:47.39]So we got a new setup here.
[00:52.06]I've got a new monitor.
[00:54.12]Everything's new.
[00:56.54]So I'm just trying to figure out how to make all the new stuff work.
[01:01.17]You know.
[01:01.41]Give me a minute.
[01:03.75]Early stream.
[01:04.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05.67]I'll see you soon.
[01:06.21]Hold on.
[01:06.55]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[01:07.25]Be right back.
[02:28.45]Okay.
[02:29.83]So... Let's do this.
[02:33.97]Do this.
[02:35.65]And do this.
[02:38.21]Hi!
[02:43.14]How did we use the Twitch integration?
[02:44.30]Okay, so... If you don't know, this is... This is... The game called Immortal Redneck.
[02:54.06]And...
[02:55.99]You know.
[02:57.47]It has Twitch integration.
[02:58.41]It wasn't on last time.
[02:59.31]I played this a couple days ago.
[03:03.46]Hope you enjoy the Twitch integration.
[03:08.34]Which is, you guys pick certain things that I do.
[03:11.52]You're going to see on the screen.
[03:14.52]It's going to be like, oh, not on the screen.
[03:16.56]Actually, it will be on the screen.
[03:17.46]I have to go inside the studio here.
[03:23.09]The surgeon.
[03:23.59]Yeah, that's me.
[03:25.91]But yeah, you're going to see some scrolls on the screen.
[03:28.86]I don't even know what half the shit in this game does.
[03:31.66]So I don't know what you guys will even be choosing.
[03:35.94]But in the chat, it's going to be a fucking nightmare, by the way.
[03:39.40]So you're going to say 1, 2, or 3 with the number sign to vote on what scroll you want to give me.
[03:50.78]I believe there is no cooldown.
[03:52.74]This is going to be literally a 1, 2, 3 stream.
[03:56.59]That's it.
[03:57.87]Like, no one's going to be able to write in this chat today.
[04:00.83]So I'm going to have to turn it off at some point.
[04:03.11]Because no one will be able to speak.
[04:06.83]So, mods, congrats.
[04:09.33]Hopefully you guys enjoy.
[04:10.83]Everybody that wants to chat during this stream, good luck.
[04:13.86]Because this is now a 1, 2, 3 stream.
[04:14.86]So...
[04:16.89]And you'll see exactly what I mean here in a second once I go in this room.
[04:19.72]So, anyways.
[04:20.88]You'll see.
[04:21.32]I don't know what any of this stuff means, but here we go.
[04:24.40]If you remember from last time, this is a very fun game.

[04:27.36]I'm going to buy a scroll.
[04:32.59]Very fun game.

[05:53.36]Oh no, blindfolded.
[05:54.14]Oh, like, here's the funny part.
[05:55.81]You guys, you could probably make my screen all blurry if you really wanted to.
[05:59.19]But no, you guys would rather just say shit.
[06:01.83]That works, that's fine.
[06:13.81]Yeah, you just have to write one, two, or three.
[06:16.15]Like, no one's gonna be able to chat at all this entire stream.
[06:23.89]This lasts a long-ass time, too.
[06:27.95]Whoops, didn't mean to right-click, but I did.
[06:29.71]Heh.
[06:33.17]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[06:51.23]This is probably gonna slow me down, isn't it?
[06:56.12]Yeah, there's no... Okay, shit.
[06:58.54]Watch your language.
[06:59.36]Your community has picked this.
[07:00.48]Okay, so... What does that do?
[07:06.26]I don't even know what that does.
[07:08.46]Okay, literally it just said shit on the screen.
[07:10.68]That's all it did.
[07:13.00]Hope you guys are happy with your pick, because that's all it was.
[07:19.60]Look at this chat.
[07:21.23]I can't even fucking see.
[07:23.09]I told you this was going to happen.
[07:25.05]I knew this was going to happen too.
[07:33.32]That's so funny.
[07:38.84]Oh, I'm taking a lot of damage.
[07:43.60]And there's meat on the ground over there somewhere.
[07:45.22]I don't like this room.
[07:56.35]Thanks for the meat.
[08:01.70]Okay.
[08:02.64]One more guy.
[08:03.06]All the way down.
[08:07.85]Really?
[08:09.71]Really?
[08:10.01]Okay, where'd that meat go?
[08:12.67]Alright, radio-onic glasses is currently winning.
[08:16.35]Did I miss the meat already?
[08:17.71]Shit, oh well.
[08:20.50]Did we turn on swear mode?
[08:21.70]Yeah, I don't even know what this is supposed to be doing.
[08:26.72]Whatever.
[08:27.02]I don't want to use this.
[08:36.57]Not for this room.
[08:39.25]I don't know what this is going to do to me.
[08:41.39]Is this going to be like a funny LOL thing?
[08:43.04]Am I going to get like green vision?
[08:50.28]Shows enemies on the minimap.
[08:52.22]Alright, thanks a lot guys.
[08:55.25]Thank you for showing enemies on the minimap.
[08:58.95]Wow.
[09:01.69]Dog, Twitch chat picked the right thing.
[09:03.95]Nice job guys.
[09:05.51]You did fucking great.
[09:07.02]Ow.
[09:14.85]2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2!
[09:15.33]You can't even, like, see it, damn thing.
[09:19.09]I love it.
[09:19.49]Alright.
[09:30.84]What's the next one?
[09:33.66]No, don't give me the hieroglyphic thing.
[09:36.32]I really hope you guys don't make me do that.
[09:38.56]You snooze, you lose, or cursed weapons.
[09:44.93]Whatever that means.
[09:47.65]I need this money.
[09:49.33]Okay, where to?
[09:53.47]Down to the left?
[09:59.07]Takes a long-ass time to get these votes, too.
[10:01.15]But actually, I mean, that makes sense.
[10:04.58]Otherwise, it would be a total mess.
[10:05.96]I'd get, like, a scroll every five seconds.
[10:15.10]Switch to the UGE.
[10:22.83]Ow.
[10:23.93]Ow.
[10:26.59]He said not to do it, so they changed it.
[10:28.59]Oh, come on!
[10:29.41]What the fuck?
[10:32.67]No, don't do that.
[10:33.75]You guys understand this is going to be a dead run if you do that, because I'm not going to know what anything even is.
[10:37.67]Oh, what a fucking LOL Twitch integration streamer.
[10:43.65]Hey, look, cool.
[10:44.39]Your community has picked this scroll.
[10:45.77]Now I can't read.
[10:46.67]Thanks.
[10:49.69]Wait, what?
[10:52.32]Oh.
[10:53.06]Okay, and now it went through.
[10:54.36]What weapon is this?
[10:56.34]No, I don't want a shitty pistol.
[11:03.84]You thought the hieroglyphic master was gonna make it, like, better?
[11:07.27]No way, dude.
[11:07.99]No, it makes it, like, fucking ten times worse.
[11:09.99]Uh, up there.
[11:17.44]What's the rush?
[11:18.10]Monster Hunter or lucky shot.
[11:23.62]So we're going to make this like an every other run thing.
[11:26.48]Because... Like... God damn, man.
[11:32.28]I'm not sure I want my entire stream to be one, twos, and threes for the whole stream.
[11:38.31]You know, whatever.
[11:39.47]It's all good.
[11:47.33]Monster Hunter by Capcom.
[11:49.73]Hey, that's an interesting game.
[11:56.57]Nothing even in this room.
[12:01.38]All the way to the top.
[12:04.80]Why am I streaming?
[12:05.46]You're in school.
[12:06.36]Well, get back to studying.
[12:07.22]You shouldn't be watching me right now.
[12:09.44]Get back to work.
[12:12.31]Yeah, early stream today.
[12:14.70]For the most part, it's because it is my nephew's birthday today.
[12:20.60]So, he has a little birthday party I'm going to.
[12:24.93]Happy birthday, my nephew.
[12:27.17]You know, I'm going to be a good uncle.
[12:29.15]I can't just skip my nephew's birthday party.
[12:31.89]So, I'm streaming early instead of late.
[12:36.20]I don't know what this is.
[12:37.46]So, like, congratulations, everybody, for picking hieroglyphics, because I don't even know... How are we supposed to know what any of this stuff does?
[12:45.82]It's just hieroglyphics.
[12:47.72]Alright.
[12:49.42]That's cool.
[12:50.74]That works.
[13:03.62]Oh my god, why does this gun suck?
[13:11.51]No, I gotta get the... My little taps.
[13:18.09]Just the little taps.
[13:25.92]Come here, you.
[13:30.32]One more.
[13:30.90]Oh, it's the stupid nest with the lemmings in it.
[13:33.48]Really?
[13:38.28]Really?
[13:43.19]Kaboom!
[13:48.11]Thank you, little frog friends.
[13:50.87]What are you buying?
[13:51.59]The Martian or Nitro enemies?
[13:55.34]Not sure what those do.
[13:56.76]Nitro enemies is going to kill me.
[13:58.04]Because it's going to make enemies explode.
[14:01.16]Great.
[14:01.46]Are we reloaded?
[14:07.66]I feel like this is going to be a little frog room.
[14:12.36]Yeah, I can see the snake room, whatever.
[14:14.96]Yeah, he didn't swear, though.
[14:18.66]I thought you guys put on swear mode.
[14:20.50]What happened to that?
[14:29.74]I don't know.
[14:32.90]It says... Alright, what is this?
[14:36.08]It is Cactus Ladyleg Juice Machine.
[14:41.16]Oh, okay.
[14:41.48]I don't know.
[14:41.82]Whatever that means.
[14:45.65]I love how people didn't even know what the options were.
[14:48.07]And, like, it's already... It's already, like, a bunch of votes.
[14:59.22]Nothing in here.
[15:02.00]Nitro Enemies.
[15:07.23]Let's go down to the right.
[15:12.83]Blood Offering, Rambo, or Double Edge.
[15:15.75]Good luck.
[15:17.53]Good luck, everybody.
[15:18.23]I wish you the best.
[15:31.41]Wait, oh, it tells you guys what they do?
[15:34.48]Well, give me a hand here.
[15:35.84]What does it do?
[15:37.16]I don't know what it does.
[15:37.90]I can't see.
[15:38.46]I don't have that privilege.
[15:41.94]Okay, well, he just definitely exploded.
[15:47.26]Yeah, he exploded, too.
[15:52.37]Thank you for showing the things on the minimap, though, guys.
[15:54.53]This was very helpful.
[15:55.39]I appreciate that.
[15:57.85]I wish you guys could see in chat how much money I have, because I have no fucking idea.
[16:09.40]Okay, this way.
[16:16.74]Chest in here.
[16:17.94]Multiple chests.
[16:19.11]Alright.
[16:22.25]A bow and arrow.
[16:24.55]Oh.
[16:25.01]I'm like holding down right click.
[16:30.75]Oh, I don't know what this is.
[16:31.85]Okay, well, apparently it's hurting me.
[16:38.04]I lose half my health in exchange for two scrolls.
[16:42.22]So what do these do?
[16:43.72]Okay, well.
[16:45.62]Alright, that's like a portal ball.
[16:48.58]Whatever that means.
[16:51.21]And... Somebody lit this one on fire.
[16:58.45]Okay.
[17:00.87]I'm gonna keep... Yeah, I'll use this for precision.
[17:05.25]I'm gonna keep the bow.
[17:10.26]One more chest.
[17:13.74]Well, it actually did work out pretty well.
[17:16.60]Let's see if the- hopefully the bow and arrow is good.
[17:19.61]Cursed Weapons, Mr. Wayne, or Froyo?
[17:26.09]Yeah, this thing is... How much is it for one of these shots?
[17:29.77]Let's see, one, two.
[17:33.79]Ah, that just like freaked me the fuck out.
[17:38.83]Same thing, two shots.
[17:39.75]But it's more accurate, so that's good.
[17:42.69]Looks like Cursed Weapons and Mr. Wayne is currently in a tie here.
[17:49.34]Why are these guys not on the mini-map, by the way?
[17:51.72]That guy wasn't on the mini-map.
[17:53.86]I just noticed that.
[17:54.62]I just realized that.
[17:55.18]What the fuck?
[17:58.34]Wait a minute!
[17:59.14]What just happened?
[18:00.00]I can see again!
[18:02.82]I can see!
[18:03.56]Why can I see?
[18:05.02]Oh, it burnt one of my random scrolls and it burnt hieroglyphics.
[18:09.52]That's fucking awesome.
[18:12.14]Oh, some of them... Whoa, wait!
[18:14.08]What?
[18:14.42]What's going on?
[18:15.10]Why do I have no scrolls?
[18:16.30]What the fuck happened?
[18:19.52]Why do I not have any scrolls?
[18:26.14]Okay.
[18:28.36]So it deleted all the scrolls.
[18:31.36]Why did you guys pick that?
[18:36.02]That seems unwise.
[18:37.88]You can't switch weapons while you have ammo.
[18:40.52]What?
[18:43.49]Wait.
[18:44.47]What do you mean I can't?
[18:48.19]I have to use this?
[18:49.05]All eight of these?
[18:49.87]I don't want to use all eight of these.
[18:56.85]Oh, come on.
[18:58.81]That's fucking bullshit.
[19:00.08]This is the only scroll I have now.
[19:04.44]Oh, no.
[19:05.22]Oh, well.
[19:05.80]Okay.
[19:06.76]Let's keep going.
[19:11.82]Mmm.
[19:12.76]That was a delicious drink.
[19:14.68]Hey, thank you, Corvid, for the 250.
[19:16.74]There was a rat in our classroom and a girl decided to name it Jeremy.
[19:19.35]Well, very cool.
[19:20.79]Thank you for the 250.
[19:21.51]I still can't switch this out.
[19:27.91]This looks like a new... biome.
[19:31.41]Why am I calling it a biome?
[19:34.40]Is that the only thing I can say?
[19:35.72]Oh, it's a new biome, like Minecraft.
[19:42.36]I really wish I could take this off right now.
[19:49.86]God.
[19:53.40]God damn it.
[19:54.10]I don't want to use this.
[20:01.20]No shit.
[20:01.98]I just picked up ammo.
[20:03.10]Come on.
[20:09.11]I can't... Oh, well.
[20:12.23]You know.
[20:13.63]It is what it is.
[20:17.97]Bloody upgrade.
[20:18.99]At least I can see what the hell they do now.
[20:28.18]Okay.
[20:28.82]Shoot this one more time, and then I gotta... What do I... I'm gonna put on the bow and arrow.
[20:33.08]I think I don't mind having the bow and arrow on permanently.
[20:36.36]Essentially, right?
[20:42.12]No, shit!
[20:53.91]Oh, I got picked up a fucking rocket launcher.
[20:55.53]No, god damn it.
[21:00.25]I don't want the rocket launcher.
[21:01.51]Do I?
[21:01.91]Maybe I do.
[21:02.53]Fine.
[21:03.31]God, come on.
[21:05.68]Increase the maximum health by 30%.
[21:06.64]Thanks a lot, guys.
[21:10.80]Hey, thank you, Mitchell.
[21:13.00]256 for the 20 bucks.
[21:13.96]Today, Jerma learns the nature of Murphy's Law and how human audience makes it 200% worse.
[21:18.30]Thanks so much for the early streams, Jerma.
[21:19.72]Usually can't catch the fun because of working night shift.
[21:22.52]Really appreciate your wonky sleep schedule.
[21:24.21]Well, yeah.
[21:25.73]Nice one, boys.
[21:27.37]Now we're cooking.
[21:28.53]Look, I get, like, a lot of people will say, like, I wish that they wished I streamed earlier.
[21:34.11]And, like, I do, like, I am sorry that, like, East Coast time is, like, weird for a lot of people.
[21:40.69]Where's this last guy?
[21:41.31]Oh, he's over there.
[21:42.33]Where the hell is that guy?
[21:43.21]He's all the way over there.
[21:46.20]Great.
[21:47.62]East Coast time is a weird time zone for a lot of places on Earth.
[21:52.56]And I do understand that.
[21:54.24]But, like, 7pm usually is when, like, prime time for me.
[21:59.07]I mean, like, most alert, most awake.
[22:01.25]I'm just gonna, I don't know, just turn this on so I don't kill myself here.
[22:06.81]So, like, I do like to time to time try to get some other streams in
[22:11.92]At least ones that are early enough, right?
[22:17.25]Oh, great.
[22:18.95]F***ing frogs.
[22:27.97]I mean, do I want to kill?
[22:34.69]I'm so scared to shoot this in this small room, but you know what?
[22:37.38]Whatever.
[22:41.61]The rocket launcher is okay.
[22:43.03]I really would much rather have the bow and arrow, though.
[22:45.95]It's, like, safer for me.
[22:51.98]Frogs, frogs, frogs.
[22:54.42]And... The guy from Beauty and the Beast.
[22:59.16]I gotta use these all up.
[23:00.42]We'll get, like, the whole frog family here.
[23:06.97]Okay.
[23:07.65]No!
[23:08.05]God damn it!
[23:10.41]It, like, auto...
[23:14.77]Okay.
[23:15.77]Well, now I have to... I don't want to use this.
[23:23.57]Any more health?
[23:25.83]Turret mode, Rambo, and Double Edge.
[23:27.25]Looks like turret mode is going to be what we're going to be using.
[23:30.62]Let's go top left.
[23:32.20]Only place I can go.
[23:40.20]I wonder what turret mode does.
[23:43.84]Your attack increases if you stand still.
[23:47.44]Interesting.
[23:52.16]Alright.
[23:53.10]So if I stand completely still, it hurts people.
[23:56.21]You got it.
[23:58.33]I'm gonna go this way.
[24:05.59]I can't stand still over here.
[24:10.84]That didn't kill him.
[24:11.62]Are you fucking serious?
[24:22.87]Well, here's the place to- GAAAH!
[24:25.53]Fuck.
[24:29.31]You know what?
[24:29.77]Like, fuck it.
[24:30.33]I don't even- Fuck standing still.
[24:35.00]This is gonna get me killed.
[24:35.90]Give me the bow and arrow.
[24:39.78]I'm okay with holding on to this forever.
[24:53.10]At least I can be precise with this.
[25:01.85]Okay.
[25:03.53]Let's just get out of here.
[25:08.74]Floor three.
[25:12.36]He's gonna lose.
[25:13.76]Yeah, I probably will.
[25:15.60]Hey, thank you, uh, Husan.
[25:17.68]I think his name is Husan.
[25:18.98]Thank you for the five bucks.
[25:20.28]Says, uh, must purchase bits for early stream to make early stream more profitable for American streamer.
[25:27.05]Thank you, uh, thank you, Husan.
[25:30.33]Also, Fidox gave two bucks.
[25:31.95]Thanks, Fidox.
[25:32.71]More early Jerma stream?
[25:33.76]Heck yes.
[25:35.46]I will try.
[25:35.92]I will try.
[25:46.79]God damn it!
[25:48.37]God damn it!
[25:49.72]Nice like voice crack.
[25:52.14]Just forget about standing still when there's like fucking bombs everywhere.
[25:58.85]You are so lucky that you're not getting hit by this shit.
[26:11.39]Okay, I was going to say that if that didn't hit him, then fuck me.
[26:15.45]If you miss a shot, you lose an additional bullet.
[26:17.37]No!
[26:17.75]Why?
[26:22.50]That's going to make this so much worse.
[26:30.82]You know, just... Oh, come on.
[26:42.88]Gimme, gimme the meat.
[26:45.52]Gimme the meat, I need it.
[26:46.50]I need to upgrade that so bad, by the way.
[26:50.10]Alright, shit again.
[26:55.93]No, don't do shit.
[26:58.35]Do something else.
[26:59.45]Shit doesn't do anything.
[27:03.98]All shit does is just have shit on the screen.
[27:06.22]It doesn't even do anything.
[27:12.46]And I can't miss any shots now.
[27:19.02]Thanks to fucking Twitch chat.
[27:23.70]Oh, god damn it.
[27:24.76]Where?
[27:25.46]What?
[27:30.55]In situations like this where I wish I could take this off.
[27:33.05]Who the fuck is shooting me right now?
[27:34.53]I'm actually, this is angering me.
[27:39.97]For the love of god.
[27:44.01]I can't even, like, reach this shit, can I?
[27:49.54]Thank god.
[27:51.26]Thank god.
[27:51.80]Everyone's voting for shit.
[28:08.36]Again.
[28:11.01]Oh my god, guys, come on.
[28:13.89]Don't vote for shit.
[28:15.73]Quick.
[28:16.47]Is there like 500 people that can vote right now for empathy?
[28:19.55]Because that's what I need.
[28:20.33]This is a boss.
[28:21.83]This is a boss!
[28:23.27]We're gonna let shit go through before I walk in this door, because here's the boss.
[28:27.93]And I have to kill the boss with a bow and arrow.
[28:29.75]And I can't get hit more than once.
[28:30.97]Are you guys ready for the funny thing?
[28:33.25]Here we go, ready?
[28:33.81]Shit!
[28:41.35]The air is lava.
[28:42.53]Empathy.
[28:42.95]No, give me some empathy.
[28:45.07]I'm gonna lose right now.
[28:48.37]I'm just gonna... I'm dead.
[28:49.53]Alright, you gotta like kill the... Just gotta destroy the things.
[29:01.52]How many does it take?
[29:04.20]How many shots?
[29:05.10]Three shots?
[29:06.90]Wow, dude.
[29:15.00]Hmm, this is bad to have right now.
[29:24.54]Keep running.
[29:25.10]Don't run right next to him.
[29:29.31]Oh, this weapon sucks.
[29:31.21]This weapon sucks for right here.
[29:33.13]No, don't pick up the ammo.
[29:34.07]I did it anyways.
[29:34.59]I freaked out and I fucking collected it just because it's like a muscle memory thing.
[29:42.88]Alright, now I can actually hit him.
[29:54.85]Fucking god.
[29:55.71]This thing sucks.
[29:57.49]Just shoot it!
[29:58.27]Quick, get rid of all the ammo!
[30:00.41]And give me the fucking revolver.
[30:02.07]That's the only thing I'm gonna lose.
[30:10.30]I can't even, if I miss, if I miss a shot, it takes two.
[30:14.09]Oh my lord, this is fucking horrible.
[30:22.97]God damn it.
[30:26.60]Oh, come on.
[30:28.82]Oh, like, this is, like, fuck this.
[30:31.40]Like, that was terrible.
[30:36.36]The two weapons I was using, like, just, that, fuck that.
[30:46.61]I could shoot that gun, like, two times.
[30:52.03]Uh, what is this?
[30:53.13]No, no, no.
[30:54.05]Actually... No, fuck his weapons.
[31:00.14]I'll try it one more time.
[31:05.80]Twitch chat did it.
[31:06.74]Yeah, Twitch chat gave me, like, the... You know?
[31:13.33]I need...
[31:16.49]I really need to, like, make this better.
[31:23.33]And how much is this?
[31:24.93]Sekhmet.
[31:28.03]Uh, yeah.
[31:29.23]I would like to choose Sekhmet.
[31:33.28]Like, please.
[31:34.86]Absolutely.
[31:35.26]Let's try Sekhmet.
[31:38.82]Let's go die.
[31:44.20]Uh, hey, uh, It'saboy.
[31:46.80]I think that person's name is It'saboy.
[31:52.70]It'saboy, number one.
[31:53.84]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[31:57.07]Uh, it says, the text says, it says, Hey, Jerma, have you played Breath of the Wild yet?
[32:02.93]If so, what do you think?
[32:04.19]I actually don't even have a Switch.
[32:06.73]So I have not played Breath of the Wild, even though it looks like it's kind of ridiculous.
[32:11.74]Looks fantastic, but we're just gonna die right here.
[32:14.91]Your voting is not necessary.
[32:16.96]We're gonna die right now.
[32:19.30]But no, looks awesome.
[32:21.28]I don't have a Switch yet.
[32:22.66]Gonna wait till there's more games for it that I would like.
[32:26.98]Thank you though, It'saboy.
[32:30.37]For the 15 bucks.
[32:31.73]Appreciate it.
[32:35.35]And then thank you forrealdo for the 170.
[32:37.89]Did you read my resub about adventure games?
[32:39.63]If yes, if no.
[32:42.32]Crike good, crike bad.
[32:43.98]If no.
[32:46.39]Oh, hold on.
[32:47.31]Wait, what happened to... What happened to Seth?
[32:56.18]Can I only have three of these unlocked at a time?
[33:03.96]What weapons does she have?
[33:07.87]That lion lady can turn shit into steak?
[33:14.67]Okay, Ankh double pistols.
[33:18.72]And a Phoenix.
[33:19.58]What the hell does that do?
[33:23.44]It's kind of like the same color as like everything here.
[33:28.56]They're just homing missiles.
[33:35.32]That's actually, like, kind of ridiculous.
[33:36.92]That's actually incredible.
[33:39.58]Okay.
[33:41.86]So she has, like... The character's pretty great.
[33:44.67]What is her active skill?
[33:46.13]Turn everything to meat.
[33:46.85]I just want to see.
[33:49.53]Your maximum health increases with each new room you discover, and I can turn every visible object into stakes.
[33:56.71]I think I'm going to like this character.
[33:58.49]This character seems kind of insane.
[34:01.25]But let's go.
[34:04.03]Alright, we're gonna do the Twitch integration one more time.
[34:07.31]And then I'm gonna turn it off for a couple of runs just so people can actually chat.
[34:14.53]Because obviously at this point you all know this is a 1-2-3 stream now.
[34:21.46]There we go.
[34:27.20]Let's help him this run.
[34:28.42]Yeah, give me the good stuff.
[34:30.32]Give me the helping hand.
[34:39.80]This is actually a terrible room to start in.
[34:41.74]I want to get like high up.
[34:45.73]I need the high ground here.
[34:52.65]Like that, that's why.
[34:55.03]Okay, I got too many projectiles from all these people.
[35:00.07]Oh my lord, this is horrible.
[35:11.96]Wrap around.
[35:17.06]So my third monitor is giving me frame rate issues, and I was concerned about that.
[35:24.23]Gonna have to replace this monitor.
[35:25.99]Because it sucks.
[35:31.03]Unfortunately.
[35:31.63]I hate to say it.
[35:33.73]But this third monitor is causing me frame issues.
[35:38.91]Oh well.
[35:40.94]Send it back to Amazon.
[35:42.24]Okay.
[35:45.13]Is there any items I can pick up?
[35:46.89]That I didn't turn in?
[35:48.01]Whatever.
[35:48.43]You know.
[35:54.36]Oh, shit.
[35:55.08]I'm going to have to use a phoenix here.
[35:56.08]Let's see how good this is.
[36:00.52]Jumping grants you a temporary speed bonus.
[36:02.12]Are you kidding me?
[36:03.67]So, are you going to let me bunny hop?
[36:06.62]Ooh, that's cool.
[36:07.95]Okay, I don't need to do this yet, apparently.
[36:15.35]Oh god, that's actually, that's... Wow, that's amazing.
[36:30.50]Her active... That only heals for four.
[36:35.02]I just wanted to test that to see how much that actually healed.
[36:37.30]For four HP, I guess if you can convert an entire room of stuff, maybe?
[36:54.13]Come on, hit them.
[36:55.55]Come on, homing missiles.
[36:56.59]Get them.
[36:58.45]Oh, okay, whatever.
[37:10.88]Actually charges pretty quickly too.
[37:12.18]Well, it takes like one room.
[37:18.20]Okay, that's maybe not too bad.
[37:20.70]Maybe not too bad.
[37:30.33]I didn't jump over you.
[37:32.68]That's a lot of baloney.
[37:36.82]So it looks like you can sacrifice money.
[37:38.38]Right?
[37:42.32]It's pretty much every single room this is recharged.
[37:45.67]Looks like I'm gonna get a shield.
[37:46.61]Am I gonna get a shield?
[37:47.69]You guys gonna give me a shield?
[37:49.91]You guys gonna be good friends?
[37:50.79]Increases defense.
[37:51.55]Thank you so much.
[37:54.07]Thanks for the increased defense.
[37:55.12]You guys fucking rock.
[38:02.96]This weapon kind of really sucks.
[38:07.87]This weapon kind of really sucks.
[38:15.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:16.43]Oh, this way and up.
[38:22.59]Oh, wait, hold on.
[38:23.73]What is happening here?
[38:24.55]There we go.
[38:28.31]I'm going too fast.
[38:29.33]Too fast!
[38:39.11]I mean, should I just, like, throw these out here?
[38:40.57]I mean, I guess, yeah, that's kind of working.
[38:47.20]In a roundabout way.
[38:48.08]Come on.
[39:07.54]Come on, this way.
[39:20.61]Die, please.
[39:23.99]Wow, that was... That was no damage.
[39:29.85]Alright, give me like a damage increase.
[39:34.04]Any of those damage increase 25%?
[39:35.94]Oh no.
[39:42.50]Doubles your chances.
[39:43.38]You guys are giving me such incredible things.
[39:49.23]Alright, nice.
[39:49.69]Thanks for the double crit chance, guys.
[39:51.63]I, like, actually needed that.
[39:52.77]This is gonna be kind of nightmarish, so we're gonna go like this.
[40:04.03]Well, that sucked.
[40:05.25]I, like, fell off the edge.
[40:06.63]Fucking fantastic work, Jeremy.
[40:10.49]We're just gonna stand here and do this.
[40:23.15]Got it.
[40:23.43]Nice.
[40:23.67]Thank God.
[40:23.97]That would have been so disappointing.
[40:27.11]Rainbow, caution, wet floor, or fast fingers.
[40:29.44]Don't give me something negative.
[40:30.48]That's negative.
[40:31.06]That sounds very negative.
[40:34.66]Chest.
[40:39.94]Two meats.
[40:43.70]How disappointing.
[40:45.12]Anything else in here?
[40:45.84]Come on.
[40:46.57]It can't just be that, right?
[40:49.85]Apparently.
[40:53.42]Give him one bad thing.
[40:54.76]It's going to be too easy.
[40:59.36]Well, it's currently... Caution, Wet Floor, and Rambo are currently neck and neck.
[41:19.42]That's a good place to do this.
[41:28.76]This bunny hop thing is insane.
[41:30.08]Thanks for the crit chance!
[41:34.52]Oh, improves your attack.
[41:35.76]Alright, if I lose this run, then like, I need to give up my gamer license.
[41:45.71]And then when I say run, I mean if I don't beat the boss here, then my gamer license gets revoked and I gotta go back to the DMV.
[42:06.58]Like, back to the DMV with me if I can't do this right now.
[42:19.33]Come on, get up there.
[42:19.99]I need that money.
[42:23.51]This way.
[42:26.88]I wonder what's going to win, guys.
[42:29.14]Shit is on the menu.
[42:34.67]I wonder what's gonna win every time it is available.
[42:38.61]Do you think it's gonna be shit every time?
[42:43.13]I do.
[42:44.09]I think it's gonna be shit.
[42:49.68]Oh, what the flying fuck?
[42:56.61]Does this guy spawn on me or do they come up the stairs?
[43:14.48]I mean, people, big frogs, people.
[43:17.74]Ah!
[43:19.48]Oh, fuck.
[43:24.85]Every time you shoot, there's a chance you may create a phoenix.
[43:28.43]Thank God shit didn't win.
[43:31.41]I was talking so much shit, and shit did not win.
[43:35.43]Well, thank you guys for not picking shit.
[43:42.27]I appreciate that.
[43:46.19]Where's this last guy?
[43:59.31]Dead.
[44:00.71]One more.
[44:01.19]Oh, you little asshole, where are you?
[44:11.43]Ugh!
[44:12.17]Is he down the stairs or something?
[44:15.85]This is one of those dumb puke pits.
[44:26.45]Keep going.
[44:30.81]The Martian or Rage?
[44:32.96]Looks like Rage is... Oh, they're neck and neck.
[44:37.44]They're very both... Very both close.
[44:41.20]Yeah, they are.
[44:43.64]Here's the exit.
[44:44.70]Hooray.
[44:47.57]How are we doing?
[44:48.07]Three of these?
[44:55.06]Yeah.
[45:01.24]Anybody creeping up behind me?
[45:02.14]I hope not.
[45:15.58]Gravity becomes like it's on Mars.
[45:18.64]What?
[45:21.70]Is that... So it's just low gravity?
[45:24.84]I guess it's kind of better gravity.
[45:28.55]It's lower gravity, upper gravity, up gravity, gravity that goes up.
[45:35.17]Nice, guys.
[45:35.63]Thanks for the gravity that goes up.
[45:44.20]Meat.
[45:45.00]Gimme.
[45:46.32]That is really weird.
[45:47.20]You, like, float around.
[45:50.08]Please try again or emergency landing.
[45:54.55]Please try again.
[46:00.03]Watch that bee, like, start the whole run over.
[46:01.69]That would be so stupid.
[46:04.95]That would be so angry.
[46:05.87]Actually, wait a minute.
[46:10.79]That might reset...
[46:12.85]No, don't vote for that.
[46:13.85]Come on.
[46:14.27]That's probably going to restart everything, isn't it?
[46:18.75]And thank you, Frog Luck, for the $5.
[46:20.37]Hey, it was my birthday recently.
[46:21.47]I just turned 19.
[46:22.27]I was wondering if you could tell Grandpa I got his gift in the mail.
[46:25.37]Tell him to please stop sending me dead animals in the mail.
[46:28.96]Well, Frog Luck, I will tell him to stop doing that.
[46:31.12]But thank you for the $5.
[46:31.98]Appreciate it.
[46:35.50]No, and of course, like I say it, and now that has 250 fucking votes.
[46:40.56]Why did I say that?
[46:42.00]Save me.
[46:42.56]Hey, rest of chat, save me.

[47:39.35]That's such bullshit.
[47:43.45]Now, what is pacifism now?
[47:44.97]Because I told everyone to spam one, and that trickled over into this next scroll.
[47:51.11]But don't know what that means.
[47:53.12]About to find out.
[47:53.90]God damn it.
[48:00.58]Nice jump scare, frog.
[48:04.00]Really?
[48:05.28]Come on.
[48:05.92]Really?
[48:06.34]It's the stupid fucking spikes in the ground.
[48:14.53]I'm going to have to convert some of you monies.
[48:21.20]I can't.
[48:21.56]I need that.
[48:25.18]Pacifism or metamorphosis.
[48:28.04]I'm going to assume that's like you turn monsters into chickens sometimes.
[48:36.83]Blacklist the vote phrases with better twitch.tv.
[48:41.11]Yeah, you could do that.
[48:42.99]I don't have better twitch.tv.
[48:43.87]Because I'm a fucking piece of crap.
[48:46.78]So, I mean... If you're not a piece of crap like me, and you have better twitch.tv, then yeah.
[48:54.24]Remember, you can't be a piece of crap.
[49:00.27]In theory, this should be doing good things, but it's not really doing anything.
[49:07.10]Okay, yeah, so I can... Each shot has a chance of transforming a henchman into a chicken.
[49:12.24]Very cool.
[49:13.58]Nice work, chat.
[49:17.81]Nice work, everybody.
[49:24.01]Everybody did a great job.
[49:27.74]Appreciate it.
[49:29.84]Disease, snooze, you lose.
[49:30.92]Cursed favor.
[49:31.60]I don't know what that means.
[49:35.28]We'll find out soon enough.
[49:38.02]I don't even care.
[49:38.82]Just kill him.
[49:40.98]Nice!
[49:42.46]Although I do want that.
[49:45.68]Oh shit, don't... Fall damage?
[49:47.38]Fall damage?
[49:47.80]There's no fall damage on Mars!
[49:49.44]Okay?
[49:51.79]There's no... Oh, and this is really hard.
[49:56.73]Seriously, there's no fall damage on Mars.
[49:58.59]Shit!
[50:03.79]Mars doesn't have fall damage.
[50:11.43]Okay, we're gonna... We're going for this.
[50:15.31]I want full health.
[50:16.55]I don't care.
[50:17.07]Money is money, but full health is full health.
[50:31.44]These chickens are freaking me out, too.
[50:40.69]God damn it, that thing is so weak.
[50:47.96]Disease.
[50:51.42]I hope that's not a disease for me.
[50:53.12]I hope that's a disease for other people.
[50:55.58]Chris, this is your attack, but you can only carry one weapon.
[51:00.89]Hold on, let me get my fucking raw turkey legs and think about this.
[51:09.41]The Ankh sucks, though.
[51:10.67]Like, I don't want to use the Ankh.
[51:15.67]But I have to.
[51:18.94]Otherwise, I won't be able to kill enemies.
[51:20.32]Great.
[51:30.13]Plentiful and disease.
[51:37.91]I don't even know why I picked that up.
[51:40.07]Uh, get me up there.
[51:40.79]Get me up there.
[51:41.17]How do I get up there?
[51:41.77]How do I get up there?
[51:45.17]Can I, like, even get up there?
[51:46.25]I can.
[51:46.99]Come on.
[51:47.51]Hurry up.
[51:48.57]Oh, fuck you.
[51:50.81]Oh, fuck you too.
[51:52.19]Fuck everybody.
[51:53.17]Fuck the chicken.
[51:53.93]Fuck the world.
[51:55.43]God damn it.
[52:03.80]God damn it.
[52:04.88]Fuck the world.
[52:10.34]Is this gonna hurt me?
[52:11.20]Thank God.
[52:17.19]Fuck everybody!
[52:18.07]Oh, God damn it!
[52:23.97]Fuck the world!
[52:24.69]I was supposed to do that on the meat.
[52:28.03]Fuck the world.
[52:29.79]Yeah, fuck the world, guys.
[52:31.17]This weapon is such a piece of shit.
[52:44.28]Get rid of GLaDOS.
[52:46.37]Yes, I made that joke last stream, but it decreases enemy health.
[52:49.37]Thank you so much, guys.
[52:53.15]You guys seriously, like, you guys are making me, you guys are making me, like, able to win here.
[53:00.13]On the way to that other... What's the rush?
[53:10.46]Bad investment or shield?
[53:11.52]Shield.
[53:14.28]I have more damage and they have less health.
[53:16.44]So thank you for doing that because the Ankh is a piece of crap.
[53:18.64]So that's like... You guys gave me the anti-Ankh.
[53:21.46]I appreciate it.
[53:25.87]Where?
[53:28.07]Where's this last guy?
[53:32.23]Come on.
[53:36.69]Oh.
[53:38.31]You're in a really weird spot.
[53:43.13]Don't hurt me.
[53:45.34]The thing is, I don't even know where fall damage even exists.
[53:51.74]That's gonna be fall damage.
[53:52.98]That's gonna be fall damage.
[53:54.20]That's gonna be fall damage.
[53:55.52]Okay.
[53:59.08]Oh, shit.
[54:00.50]I don't know how far you have to fall for it to be fall damage.
[54:09.20]What do we got?
[54:11.15]meat and the kunai.
[54:15.15]But I don't... No, I can't.
[54:18.77]Because if I'm going to run out of shit, I have to stay with this.
[54:23.44]I'm going to run out.
[54:25.30]And if I have no ammo, I can't kill enemies.
[54:27.60]I wish I could do that.
[54:34.38]Whatever.
[54:34.76]What's the rush?
[54:35.40]Bad investment.
[54:37.60]Whatever those mean.
[54:39.57]Okay, I got to go up.
[54:45.43]and left and up what is what's the rush is this great oh god damn it okay we're good you run instead of walking
[55:15.91]Aren't I... Aren't I already running?
[55:18.54]Is there a chest in here?
[55:26.18]I'm going so fucking fast, I can't even control this.
[55:29.18]God!
[55:29.92]Jesus!
[55:33.56]I'm moving too fast.
[55:34.66]Alright, I gotta get the coins and then turn these into meat.
[55:38.33]Okay, we're good.
[55:43.01]Down to the left.
[55:46.13]Sorry, not sorry.
[55:51.08]Don't I have like the fast boots too?
[55:52.62]Yeah, I'm going like an outrageous speed right now.
[56:08.16]Okay, no more jumping because it's gonna make me throw up.
[56:16.96]Whatever, just get it.
[56:25.13]Hi, I'll just miss every shot, that's fine.
[56:27.55]Watch out for the fucking peek-a-boo spooky guy, that's fine.
[56:30.88]Cool.
[56:38.88]Shit.
[56:47.54]The floating.
[56:48.00]The floating is throwing me off so bad.
[56:50.08]This fucking Mars gravity.
[56:54.07]I thought you weigh more on Mars.
[56:57.13]Isn't that the whole thing?
[56:57.81]Like, you weigh more on Mars?
[56:59.47]Shouldn't I be not jumping high?
[57:00.83]What the fuck?
[57:20.44]Okay, those are still good.
[57:21.40]204 health.
[57:24.62]Alright.
[57:27.02]No mass because less gravity.
[57:28.42]No, in Mars, if you weigh like 125 pounds on Mars, you weigh like 5,000 pounds.
[57:35.88]What?
[57:38.36]Replace all your weapons with random ones.
[57:44.06]And it's the fucking worst thing ever.
[57:49.41]This gun sucks.
[57:50.89]And I only have... I have six shots.
[57:56.05]Oh, wonderful.
[58:03.44]Okay.
[58:04.44]Well, let's hope we keep running into ammo, because otherwise I'm not going to be able to beat this at all.
[58:11.06]Still nothing.
[58:17.74]no fall damage don't land okay this is the only other way I can go it has to be this way oh watch out for the like kindergarten class like all running slow down
[58:44.57]Yes, I know you're excited.
[58:45.55]I know you're excited to be at the fair.
[58:47.61]But slow the fuck down.
[58:50.35]This is the one field trip a year that we get to take you on.
[58:53.14]Don't blow it.
[58:55.60]And then like the one kid that does something terrible makes us all have to go home.
[59:01.96]Like little Johnny.
[59:04.76]Like spitting a fucking popcorn machine and now we all have to go home.
[59:08.06]Don't fucking do that.
[59:09.80]Oh my god.
[59:18.46]So, hey, so I can make the joke correctly.
[59:20.55]What's the, um... What's the clock's name from Be Our Guest?
[59:26.73]I mean, Beauty and the Beast.
[59:30.21]What is the clock's name?
[59:30.97]Like, Gertrude?
[59:33.61]I think that was a full ammo, and I just fucking picked it up.
[59:37.19]What's the name?
[59:40.15]Gunther?
[59:46.41]Come on, that was not that far of a drop.
[59:51.05]Where?
[59:55.71]Is it like the scout?
[59:57.03]Fuck you, come on!
[60:00.74]I double jumped right there.
[60:02.42]Are you telling me that that was not... What?
[60:05.62]Flying... Fuck.
[60:08.34]Hey, thanks.
[60:08.92]They have such low health.
[60:12.12]This is doing me so many favors, actually.
[60:13.94]Thank you, guys.
[60:15.79]Hey, thanks, guys.
[60:20.05]And I'm not even gonna, like, make it.
[60:21.37]I ain't gonna make it.
[60:26.28]Forget about the money.
[60:27.00]I need health.
[60:30.96]Please.
[60:39.65]God damn it!
[60:40.31]I needed the ammo.
[60:41.07]I had to get it.
[60:46.11]I'm I'm exacerbating every option like please like just let me out of here which one looks right uh I'm going this way there it is oh god damn I thought those I thought that was a chicken
[61:17.32]I thought that was my chicken.
[61:19.18]Nope.
[61:31.22]Whatever, just take the money.
[61:37.32]Sorry, not sorry again.
[61:38.30]No.
[61:38.62]Oh, you guys are going to switch my weapon again?
[61:40.04]Actually, good.
[61:43.42]Switch my weapon again.
[61:44.29]This thing sucks.
[61:49.83]I have to pee really badly.
[61:51.87]I might need to do that, like, right now.
[61:53.93]Yeah, I gotta pee.
[61:56.11]Um... Yeah, hold on.
[62:01.40]Let me just piss.
[62:02.50]I'll be right back.
[62:06.26]Is this gonna keep going?
[62:08.16]Are you guys just gonna be able to... I think you guys are gonna just be able to keep adding shit, like, while I'm gone.
[62:15.64]It won't be long at all.
[62:17.32]I'm gonna see what you guys give me before I go pee.
[62:21.10]Because it's a random weapon, right?
[62:23.48]If you pause, it doesn't.
[62:24.42]Well, I mean, why not just let you guys keep having the fun?
[62:26.26]Okay, please give me something good.
[62:29.55]Give me something that's really worth it.
[62:33.31]A rusty fucking revolver.
[62:34.69]Great.
[62:35.97]Worse than the last one.
[62:37.73]Alright, while I contemplate this terrible item that I just got that I have to use, I'm going to use the bathroom.
[62:44.32]I will be right back.
[62:46.48]Continue to vote.
[62:47.56]I'll see you in a minute.
[62:51.50]I'm going to leave this.
[62:52.76]You know, you know, you know, fuck it.
[62:53.84]No, I'm going to keep it paused.
[62:56.42]So I'll be right back.
[62:57.08]It's going to be, we're going to keep it paused because you're not going to be able to see the screen anyways because I'm putting on the BRB screen.
[63:01.39]So BRB.
[63:43.63]Wait, what?
[66:51.35]Does anybody else get irritated by this?
[66:54.66]I get so pissed off by having to go to the bathroom.
[66:59.20]Can I relate to anybody with this?
[67:03.95]Does that, like, fucking piss anybody else off that you have to go pee?
[67:07.89]Like, I was just pissing, right?
[67:08.83]Here's a little small story for you.
[67:10.93]So I was just peeing.
[67:12.85]And, like, halfway through, I was just done.
[67:15.63]I'm just like, I'm done.
[67:16.32]I don't want to fucking pee anymore.
[67:18.06]And my body's just still pissing.
[67:19.84]And it pissed for, like, 60 straight seconds.
[67:23.00]It's like, get the fuck out of here.
[67:24.02]I don't want to pee anymore.
[67:25.12]Like, I'm getting, like, actually upset by this.
[67:29.18]I gotta get back into the swing of things here.
[67:31.06]I only have this gun, right?
[67:32.56]Okay.
[67:32.84]God, that's... God, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!
[67:36.81]This thing is an inaccurate piece of fucking garbage.
[67:39.31]Okay.
[67:45.07]Well, we're gonna have to use a lot of our spell here.
[67:47.51]Holy shit, this gun sucks.
[67:51.90]Holy shit, this is the worst gun in the game.
[67:53.66]This is the worst gun in the game.
[67:57.48]I need the ammo.
[68:01.33]Come on, like, does anybody else have something pop out quick?
[68:05.99]Did I get it?
[68:07.25]Not really, but whatever.
[68:08.07]Okay, that's good.
[68:22.80]Mm-hmm.
[68:24.95]Bloody upgrade.
[68:26.65]Is that what I'm getting?
[68:27.19]Is that what I'm getting?
[68:29.31]Actually, that turned out okay.
[68:30.45]Except this gun... How am I going to beat the boss with this gun?
[68:39.80]I don't think I'm going to be able to physically kill the boss with this.
[68:45.10]It's going to be real close.
[68:56.70]Damn.
[69:05.73]Oh my god, this weapon.
[69:06.91]This weapon is so bad.
[69:09.09]Thank you for the max health.
[69:14.21]Thank you for the max health.
[69:15.59]I would like a different weapon than this pile of fucking garbage.
[69:21.53]I'd rather pee than use this item.
[69:25.18]You know what I'm saying?
[69:25.74]Like, I would rather go to the bathroom than use this.
[69:30.34]That's really saying something.
[69:31.59]That's a big deal.
[69:37.73]Please try again.
[69:38.77]This fucking floaty dog shit.
[69:43.08]It's okay.
[69:57.69]Oh my fucking god, that is so annoying.
[70:00.95]Literally shooting him right in the fucking face and having it hit him and not having it hit him the second time you go in the exact same spot.
[70:06.87]Fuck this gun.
[70:08.27]Please give me a new gun, Twitch.
[70:10.62]Please, Twitch chat, give me a new weapon.
[70:13.02]Whatever it takes.
[70:17.24]Whatever it fucking takes.
[70:36.15]you.
[70:39.49]Oh my god.
[70:40.43]Fuck you, game.
[70:47.12]Ugh!
[70:48.84]Oh my god!
[70:49.80]None of those hit.
[70:51.10]Did you see none of those hit this guy?
[70:53.30]What in the flying goddamn fucking circus fuck is going on right now?
[70:57.20]Does the gun suck that much, asshole?
[70:59.60]There's no way.
[71:01.18]How can this gun suck that much?
[71:04.87]Ow!
[71:21.64]That actually, like, hurt.
[71:22.92]Why?
[71:23.64]That was so stupid.
[71:24.72]That was such a waste.
[71:28.68]Alright, detonate this whole run.
[71:34.26]What?
[71:34.90]You fucking asshole.
[71:40.01]And I took fall damage.
[71:41.97]What the fuck?
[71:44.35]No, guys.
[71:47.33]And I took fucking fall damage.
[71:49.55]Thanks.
[71:57.66]Oh, God.
[71:59.64]Well, this run is a wash.
[72:02.54]Pretty much, unless I can convert an entire room into meat.
[72:08.76]What is going on?
[72:09.30]Where's the... I'm so dead here.
[72:20.75]I'm almost out of ammo.
[72:27.28]Give me that.
[72:28.78]Thank fucking god.
[72:30.10]Alright, now drop a ton of shit so I can convert it all.
[72:36.62]Oh, you fucking dick.
[72:43.84]Don't just convert it all.
[72:44.54]I don't even care.
[72:45.16]Go on.
[72:45.52]Get it all.
[72:49.16]I'm going to sit here.
[72:55.64]I do have a lot of money though, so that's good.
[73:00.60]Give Jerv a break.
[73:02.30]Started out really well, and then I got, like, screwed.
[73:04.98]Hey, at least this isn't the revolver.
[73:19.11]Okay, we're still okay.
[73:20.91]We're gonna be fine.
[73:24.11]Everything's gonna be fine.
[73:25.85]Nobody has to panic.
[73:26.68]We're gonna be okay.
[73:41.70]And there's ammo here, right?
[73:43.40]Alright, there we go.
[73:51.86]Alright, the air is lava.
[73:53.70]Jumping in the air will hurt you.
[74:01.29]How am I supposed to win?
[74:03.99]Guys, there's fall damage and there's no jumping.
[74:06.77]There is no winning.
[74:09.65]There's no winning.
[74:12.59]How am I supposed to win?
[74:13.69]I have to jump to get to certain places.
[74:15.43]Oh my god, it's so over.
[74:22.24]You telling me I can't jump?
[74:27.66]Okay.
[74:35.36]This sucks.
[74:38.74]At least I have money.
[74:43.41]I'm going to accidentally jump like a thousand times, by the way.
[74:48.72]This is going to hurt.
[74:50.10]No.
[74:50.42]Okay.
[74:50.68]So I'm going to wait until this is recharged.
[74:55.68]Hold on.
[74:55.98]Let me just do this so I can see this again.
[74:57.66]Okay.
[74:59.50]Thank you, Froglock.
[75:01.05]I'm waiting for this to recharge.
[75:02.69]Froglock0, thanks for the five bucks.
[75:03.97]This used to be a crab pot stream.
[75:07.02]Side question, is there any chance of you playing Stardew Valley again?
[75:09.56]You never got married or anything.
[75:10.80]Oh, hold on.
[75:11.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[75:11.66]We got an important thing going on here.
[75:13.72]Okay, here we go.
[75:14.44]Perfect, perfect.
[75:15.08]Give me the ammo.
[75:17.58]And convert everything.
[75:19.20]Give me, like, back to, like, near, like, 70% health.
[75:21.43]Thank you.
[75:24.01]Uh, you never got married or anything.
[75:25.11]We'd love to see your choices.
[75:26.97]And it would just be a ride to watch.
[75:27.97]Also, my cows are Jerma-themed now.
[75:29.41]One is named Jerma, then Glue Man.
[75:31.05]Comundio and Otto.
[75:33.53]Well, thank you for the five bucks, Froglock.
[75:36.40]When Stardew Valley gets a multiplayer update is when I would probably play it again.
[75:42.32]But not... Not now.
[75:44.90]Not right now.
[75:47.36]Anyways, also... It's your boy.
[75:50.68]It's a boy.
[75:51.26]It's your boy.
[75:52.63]Again, gave 15 bucks and they said thanks for the 15 dollars.
[75:55.53]Yo, I love this Twitch mode.
[75:56.61]Aside from that, does this feel like Rogue Legacy in 3D?
[75:58.79]It does.
[76:01.00]it feels very much like rogue legacy but a first-person shooter rogue legacy now I know that I was about to jump there's other games that are like this there's like uh ziggurat is one right similar concept but does ziggurat not like no why would you guys want to pick that look I understand some of the things are like to with me
[76:28.94]Like, oh, the streamer can't jump!
[76:31.40]Fuck this guy!
[76:32.22]Like, for instance.
[76:33.04]See?
[76:33.44]Like, fuck.
[76:34.38]I had to jump over here.
[76:36.30]No, I didn't.
[76:37.56]That takes- that does a lot of damage, too.
[76:39.12]But, like, hieroglyphics, nobody can- no, we can't even tell what's going on.
[76:43.77]Wait, I just went the wrong way.
[76:45.65]Ugh.
[76:49.17]I have to, like, jump here.
[76:51.82]I have to jump.
[76:54.54]I have to jump!
[76:58.15]I have to jump like four times.
[77:04.39]I have to jump.
[77:10.64]Why did that not hurt me?
[77:14.08]What?
[77:21.40]Is it like once per room?
[77:25.64]Okay, I'm confused.
[77:42.32]I can't even see how much ammo I have either.
[77:49.61]You guys are really, really screwing me.
[78:00.76]Oh my god, I'm getting so screwed.
[78:04.74]I'm going to rename this title to... Getting Screwed.
[78:12.73]Froyo.
[78:13.83]Whatever that is going to do.
[78:14.81]Cool.
[78:20.75]I would love the ammo.
[78:21.69]Thank you.
[78:25.14]That is not normal for the chickens to be here.
[78:27.00]It's something that somebody... I'm just like, something that somebody voted for.
[78:31.72]Somebody voted for it.
[78:32.84]Like, a few hundred times.
[78:41.29]Ah, god damn it!
[78:43.73]What does this do?
[78:47.69]I don't know.
[78:50.19]It's my fault.
[78:51.91]Young Boston Gamer gets screwed.
[78:53.42]Young.
[78:55.74]Actually, I'll take that.
[78:56.84]Young Boston Gamer gets screwed by Twitch chat.
[79:06.56]I'm going to float over here so I can... Actually, I'm okay with these two items.
[79:14.45]Low ammo.
[79:16.41]Not anymore.
[79:33.87]Come on, somebody drop ammo!
[79:35.21]Somebody drop ammo!
[79:37.57]I don't have much time.
[79:45.45]Fuck, don't even care about jumping.
[79:46.65]I don't care.
[79:47.09]Give me the ammo.
[79:47.53]I'm not going to be able to beat the boss.
[80:01.20]Lord of War is apparently going to win.
[80:06.20]Is there a thing you guys can vote for that's like infinite ammo or something?
[80:22.65]Okay, let's do this right.
[80:25.08]Let's pick up, like, one of these, convert this, and full health.
[80:29.12]Alright, I'm okay now.
[80:31.22]Just can't jump.
[80:40.10]This is so... I have to be so cautious.
[80:43.52]Wait, here's the boss.
[80:44.10]Here's the boss.
[80:44.48]Here's the boss.
[80:44.90]Wait a minute.
[80:45.30]Wait a minute.
[80:45.61]Wait a minute.
[80:46.03]How much...
[80:48.34]I'm not gonna be able to kill this boss.
[80:49.96]I don't even know how much... I'm gonna wait for this to go through and see what this is.
[81:00.43]I'm trying to see what this is.
[81:01.67]It's just a bunch of fucking batteries.
[81:03.47]It's just a gigantic bulk amount of batteries.
[81:06.61]Thanks for the batteries, guys.
[81:09.88]Thanks for the batteries in a ground beef package.
[81:12.86]I don't know what this means, but I have to make every single shot count.
[81:19.95]Here we go.
[81:27.11]Okay, let's go.
[81:31.18]But meat gives ammo now.
[81:32.86]Are you serious?
[81:35.00]Really?
[81:35.64]Well, I'm not going to have a chance to get any meat.
[81:43.19]Every shot has to count.
[81:44.31]Every single one.
[81:45.71]Ammo.
[81:49.30]Am I gonna play this slow?
[81:58.91]I'm not gonna be able to win.
[82:02.45]Make every shot count and then miss!
[82:12.27]Okay, hopefully I have enough to kill him.
[82:15.38]Let's hope so.
[82:18.74]There he goes!
[82:19.82]Here we go!
[82:28.11]Make every shot count!
[82:34.93]I'm almost out of ammo.
[82:42.41]Come on, please have ammo!
[82:46.21]Yes!
[82:47.15]Yes!
[82:47.43]Oh my god, I just got so lucky.
[82:49.51]That was so lucky.
[82:53.55]Come on, you too.
[82:57.40]You have ammo too.
[83:07.62]I'm not being very conservative with this.
[83:13.80]Yes!
[83:23.07]Just freak out and shoot him!
[83:24.77]Alright, he's dead.
[83:26.61]Nice.
[83:26.95]Nice work, everybody.
[83:33.49]Ooh.
[83:35.77]What?
[83:36.01]Why is it so overflowed?
[83:42.26]He knew how much ammo he had.
[83:44.08]Alright, cool.
[83:44.60]What happened?
[83:46.56]This is the thing that... Okay.
[83:48.56]I just lost half my health.
[83:49.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[83:52.49]Oh, cool.
[83:52.85]I don't know what that does.
[83:53.73]Nice.
[83:53.89]This is the nice emblem, whatever it means.
[83:58.81]Meat.
[83:59.81]I'm getting full ammo here.
[84:02.93]Super money.
[84:04.13]A lot of money.
[84:04.71]Scrolls.
[84:08.29]This is some kind of two spears.
[84:10.47]Don't know what that does.
[84:12.21]And you turn into a lightning boy.
[84:15.73]Okay.
[84:18.51]Wait, what did I just do?
[84:19.55]Did I run out of space?
[84:22.37]Flare gun.
[84:25.01]No, this is... I have to stay with this.
[84:29.88]No.
[84:29.98]Can these break?
[84:34.30]No.
[84:34.56]Alright, well this is... I haven't gone... I've never gone this far, so we're gonna keep going.
[84:40.28]Anybody know what I just did?
[84:41.37]I don't.
[84:51.23]Let me breathe.
[84:54.42]Let.
[84:54.88]Me.
[84:55.18]Breathe.
[85:05.10]Oh lord.
[85:10.74]Holy, holy shit.
[85:12.40]Alright, this is getting a little hairy for me.
[85:14.34]This is getting kinda hairy.
[85:21.59]I gotta get off.
[85:22.99]Oh, this is not a good place.
[85:29.45]Shoot him in the leg.
[85:40.20]Just convert everything.
[85:43.72]I get ammo for converting the meat, right?
[85:47.62]From my understanding.
[85:56.02]I think so.
[86:00.59]Let's go back up to 50%.
[86:01.15]Do you want to play CSGO and pull down?
[86:05.89]Come on, what?
[86:06.59]Alright, what does this one do?
[86:13.76]After receiving damage, you become invincible.
[86:17.54]But what do those two things mean?
[86:18.94]Space and escape.
[86:19.72]Like, that means replace, but replace what?
[86:23.84]I don't know what I'm... Like, am I replacing it with something?
[86:27.43]Do I have to pick it up?
[86:29.05]Or can I just leave it?
[86:29.91]I guess I can just leave them.
[86:39.27]I don't know.
[86:41.28]I have yet to figure that out.
[86:46.64]Oh, but these guys are the dumb charger things that I don't like.
[86:53.05]Hey, not for nothing, I'm making a lot of money.
[86:58.62]And I'm kind of back up to 80%.
[87:00.60]You know, well, let's just get it all on the table, right?
[87:08.32]And then I'll... Holy shit!
[87:19.01]So much meat.
[87:20.09]So much big meat.
[87:21.10]Thank God.
[87:22.87]I'm so desperate for this right now.
[87:24.29]I'm fucking so much trouble.
[87:28.34]Thank God.
[87:28.68]I don't know.
[87:30.02]Wait, what?
[87:30.62]Hold on a second.
[87:31.76]Hold on.
[87:32.06]Let me take care of it.
[87:34.12]Chicken patty?
[87:49.35]I don't know how he got up on the counter and he just ate an entire chicken patty.
[87:54.03]Was there any spices on it?
[87:58.93]There's no spices on it, right?
[88:00.05]No.
[88:01.21]I mean, whatever is just already on the chicken patty.
[88:04.20]It's alright.
[88:05.96]We'll give him a light lunch today.
[88:08.96]Okay.
[88:09.72]He'll be fine.
[88:11.46]Don't worry.
[88:12.44]We'll feed him a light lunch.
[88:14.50]Just monitor the situation.
[88:16.19]He ate a chicken patty.
[88:18.50]He's a good, he's a, that's alright.
[88:21.28]Okay, you say so.
[88:22.50]Yeah, he'll be okay.
[88:24.42]Those things are very, very tame.
[88:25.66]And tired.
[88:29.08]Nah, he'll be alright.
[88:31.42]What's in cat food anyways, right?
[88:32.62]A bunch of, like, ground up, like, fucking... A bunch of ground up eyeballs.
[88:39.90]What does this do?
[88:42.02]Oh, that's so good.
[88:42.64]Small ammunition boxes replaced with larger ones.
[88:46.37]That's so much better.
[88:48.43]Oh, you guys rock.
[88:50.04]You guys rock.
[88:56.18]Yeah, like your local cat food.
[88:57.96]I'm taking so much damage.
[89:02.43]It's like ground up fucking eyeballs and ground up bones and shit.
[89:07.15]It's probably like much higher quality food than he'd be eating anyways.
[89:17.90]We'll see.
[89:18.24]We'll make sure he's okay.
[89:23.42]Taking so much more damage, though.
[89:27.86]Where is this?
[89:28.30]Alright.
[89:36.39]That, like, nice, like, weird guy.
[89:43.43]Damn who... Damn who...
[89:47.09]Oh lord.
[89:49.27]And there's monsters.
[89:52.13]What happened?
[89:56.41]What just happened?
[89:58.25]Everything turned off and I can't get it now.
[90:00.99]Okay.
[90:01.55]Well, that was fun.
[90:03.87]What?
[90:05.03]Was I not supposed to shoot anything?
[90:06.24]How the fuck was I supposed to know that?
[90:13.28]Damn.
[90:14.06]Damn who?
[90:16.59]I see what you guys are doing there.
[90:25.06]Come on.
[90:25.44]Pull down, Jeremy.
[90:26.62]Pull down.
[90:27.18]Well, if this was Counter-Strike, I'd need to be crouching too, wouldn't I?
[90:30.68]Well, I'm gonna wait to get that.
[90:34.75]Ugh!
[90:46.50]That's so great.
[90:48.06]Thank God.
[90:48.56]At least I'll have that the rest of the time, pretty much.
[90:52.30]Pull down your pants.
[90:55.50]No, I'm not going to pull my pants down.
[90:57.88]Down lower left.
[91:05.85]What is this?
[91:06.27]70% chance of getting meat instead of gold.
[91:10.83]I don't think I want this.
[91:12.73]Actually, yeah, I do.
[91:15.19]I have lots of money.
[91:21.54]Uh, this way.
[91:25.54]Woo, laser beams.
[91:30.35]Holy shit in my pants.
[91:37.69]Come on!
[91:43.22]At least I will have, I'll pretty much have infinite ammo, that's true.
[91:45.58]That's gonna be great.
[91:58.16]70% chance that was good stuff.
[92:00.48]We just saw statistics there guys We just got some statistics there well those are a lost cause Trolls feet and here's the way up
[92:22.88]Come on.
[92:23.64]I moved in time.
[92:24.67]I definitely moved in time.
[92:26.01]Run it back.
[92:31.55]So what is the... When I get hit... You guys notice, like, what's with the blue?
[92:38.33]What is the blue?
[92:43.70]This blue shit.
[92:44.46]Like, what does that mean?
[92:53.61]It's just blue shit.
[92:58.82]Ah, that's right, that's right, okay.
[93:02.56]Onward.
[93:06.24]Stop with the Mario references.
[93:10.96]Even more damage to myself, I think.
[93:15.32]What floor?
[93:15.96]I can't even tell what floor this is.
[93:24.18]I gotta say, uh... I wonder when... Hold on.
[93:28.52]Am I gonna be going even faster?
[93:39.21]Increases your movement speed.
[93:40.37]Oh, God!
[93:42.99]This is a little... Okay, this is too... This is too much!
[93:47.41]This is too fast.
[93:52.48]This is I can't when I press W. I'm what you guys gave me no clip That's what effectively is going on right now, and I can't jump either if I jump I'm gonna hurt myself Damn it ah It's too much
[94:21.77]Don't hurt me.
[94:32.05]This is going to give me a headache real soon, guys.
[94:34.63]It actually is.
[94:35.25]I definitely shouldn't be going this fast.
[94:49.76]God damn it.
[94:56.25]Come on!
[94:56.95]Kill him!
[94:57.43]Let me wrap around here.
[95:12.74]Hello!
[95:13.08]Ah!
[95:20.07]It's too f- It's too fast.
[95:24.49]I so easily run into things.
[95:27.91]I can do that, though.
[95:28.67]I can get nice whooshes here.
[95:29.85]Okay.
[95:39.06]I can just don't double jump.
[95:41.72]Don't screw that up.
[95:42.56]I have so much money.
[95:55.69]If I can keep this up,
[95:58.20]Oh no.
[96:20.70]Could I-
[96:27.73]Look at how long it's taking to kill these.
[96:32.83]I don't have any guns.
[96:35.71]Oh my god.
[96:36.53]This is bad.
[96:41.23]You guys gonna reset the floor on me?
[96:44.11]Is that what's about to happen?
[96:46.17]I better get to the fucking end of the- I better get to the end of the level quick!
[96:59.59]Get to the end of the level quick before they reset it on me.
[97:05.37]Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[97:09.69]Where's the end of this level?
[97:11.73]Not this way.
[97:12.58]Shit.
[97:18.16]I'm taking so many hits now.
[97:23.45]I can't even kill these guys.
[97:25.63]Oh, this is over.
[97:26.63]I hope you guys had fun.
[97:28.84]I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[97:42.39]It was fun while it lasted here.
[97:43.85]Although I do have a lot of money.
[97:46.91]4,000.
[97:46.95]Where's this last guy?
[97:48.21]Where are you?
[97:56.06]Even with crits, too.
[98:00.59]Oh, this is all for nothing anyways, unless I can get out of here.
[98:04.85]Chat, don't do this to him.
[98:07.99]We're going crowbar.
[98:08.85]Oh, gotta go straighten up.
[98:13.88]I'm, like, concerned about fall damage right now.
[98:15.62]Why?
[98:16.82]It's not here anymore.
[98:20.56]Get rid of bad scrolls.
[98:27.67]And that could have been... That could have been the one, huh?
[98:34.12]That could have been the one, guys.
[98:36.22]That would have been, like, the big one.
[98:42.67]Oh, well.
[98:45.69]You know, you win some, you lose some.
[98:54.86]I'm so dead.
[98:58.67]I can't even kill these dumb serpents.
[99:00.59]These guys are so weak.
[99:08.38]It's taking a whole clip to kill these things.
[99:12.82]And I'm dead.
[99:14.19]See you later.
[99:18.31]Well, I made it to here.
[99:26.58]I'm not sure I like her.
[99:31.31]But what happened to the other guy?
[99:35.47]What happened to Apis?
[99:37.11]Why is he not here anymore?
[99:43.84]She's cool, but... Let's go back to Seth.
[99:48.72]I don't know why... Do I have to go activate him or something?
[99:56.48]Oh, it's random.
[99:57.18]Okay.
[99:59.94]I have a lot of money.
[100:03.68]Seth upgrade.
[100:07.11]Neith.
[100:07.41]I could get Neith.
[100:11.47]How much is Neith?
[100:12.21]I don't know.
[100:12.47]A little five for... Let's see what Neith is like.
[100:20.19]Neath.
[100:21.68]The Falcon will attack the nearest enemy for an active skill and passive bonus damage over long distances.
[100:28.08]She has a sniper rifle.
[100:29.04]Increases gold pickup.
[100:32.38]Pretty important.
[100:38.24]Nice.
[100:39.00]Should I... Let's try it.
[100:42.04]And spend the rest of the money on defense or health or something.
[100:48.54]Amunet.
[100:48.94]I could do this.
[100:53.42]It leaves a stump in your position that will attract enemies.
[100:55.71]Okay, so I have a taunt totem.
[100:59.11]Passive skill.
[100:59.59]You can run backwards.
[101:00.63]That's pretty cool.
[101:02.73]Seems very effective, actually.
[101:06.85]Let's get character unlocks.
[101:10.53]I want a couple extra characters, and then we'll do one or two into defense.
[101:21.58]It's 2% defense.
[101:23.57]Do I have enough for anything else?
[101:27.55]500, 571, 501.
[101:27.77]I don't think I can afford any of these.
[101:32.25]But I do have a couple more characters.
[101:34.25]I could buy a scroll.
[101:40.11]Well, we're going to do this run with Mr. Seth here.
[101:43.47]Let's buy this.
[101:48.84]Okay.
[101:49.36]There we go.
[101:50.32]Hooray!
[101:55.52]So, I think this will be the last run that I do with the Twitch chat integration.
[102:08.42]Because it's cool, it's fun.
[102:12.64]But, you know.
[102:13.76]Increases ammunition capacity with your weapons.
[102:16.46]Well, that's a great thing to start with.
[102:17.86]Okay, great.
[102:20.40]Here you go.
[102:21.82]Let's keep it moving.
[102:22.60]Let's get going.
[102:23.66]Let's do it, baby.
[102:25.64]Yeah, baby.
[102:36.35]Lots of money in the first room.
[102:39.57]Very cool.
[102:44.89]And this way.
[102:50.49]expiration date I'm like kind of freaking out because I forgot I don't have any of the scrolls I had last time so I'm just like oh I can't jump it's like yeah I can I can jump I'm gonna be fine we want to get to the end of this one as soon as possible
[103:21.15]Okay, well, there's a new item.
[103:22.41]I'm gonna do the bow instead of the dumb flamethrower.
[103:33.79]This thing sucks.
[103:36.17]Bow!
[103:39.25]We good?
[103:40.60]We good.
[103:48.35]And here is Rage, whatever Rage does.
[104:04.80]You inflict more damage, but you receive more damage.
[104:06.96]I mean, that's fine.
[104:13.84]I wonder how much more damage it is, what percentage it is.
[104:17.10]Hopefully it's not something huge and unmanageable.
[104:19.45]Because you know me, I fucking suck and get hit all the time.
[104:25.45]What a huge ass room.
[104:26.55]Oh.
[104:27.23]Alright, yeah.
[104:29.29]This is fine.
[104:30.49]It's just a chest in here.
[104:36.71]What is it?
[104:37.11]Double barrel pistol.
[104:42.79]hmm what do you think double bear pistol or laser laser danger illustrated thank you for the two bucks this game looks fantastic I might have to get it now it is very fun I think I'm gonna stick with the Tesla coil making it multiple enemies this one probably does more damage though double barrel pistol Tesla coil
[105:15.96]I think I'm okay with this.
[105:16.70]Alright, there's another chest over there.
[105:19.24]What do you got?
[105:27.47]Meat.
[105:29.91]And that's it, right?
[105:36.56]Nothing else in here, right?
[105:40.14]Oh, there's one down here.
[105:50.12]Well, we just got the upgraded version of the bow that I just had, so sure.
[105:54.57]Two new weapon upgrades.

[113:19.00]Don't be bad.
[113:25.94]That's fine.
[113:26.72]That's fine.

[113:29.24]That's okay.
[113:29.88]Whatever.
[113:31.28]That's nothing.
[113:34.56]That's totally fine.
[113:38.41]Look, and I know all you guys want to vote for, I know everybody wants to vote for Slug.
[113:42.93]Just because the name is Slug.
[113:45.37]But just weigh your options.
[113:46.67]You don't know, it could be something, something could be better.
[113:48.27]Ooh, what's that?
[113:53.46]No, don't touch that.
[113:55.64]No, I don't want that.
[113:56.46]Fuck that.
[113:57.06]I'm not even going to touch it.
[114:00.72]Touching that means this goes away, and this thing is incredible.
[114:03.18]So why would I ever do that?
[114:13.56]Uh, right here.
[114:22.35]This is like the last place to go.
[114:29.27]What am I reloading for?
[114:30.21]What is this reload?
[114:31.15]What's reloading?
[114:31.97]What is this reload?
[114:34.29]What is going on right now?
[114:37.66]Why am I reloading the gun?
[114:39.57]Why do I have ammo?
[114:41.23]What happened?
[114:41.83]What's happening?
[114:43.11]What's going on?
[114:46.15]Somebody explain to me what's happening right now.
[114:52.01]This shouldn't be happening.
[114:55.17]Why am I reloading?
[115:02.70]You dropped a new weapon so the effect went away.
[115:04.66]I thought I didn't...
[115:08.19]Oh, shit in my face.
[115:09.51]Are you serious?
[115:11.87]Well, I have to go get this then.
[115:13.51]Oh, come on.
[115:18.67]That's so... Increases weapon accuracy.
[115:20.89]Good.
[115:21.13]That's good.
[115:23.71]Whoa, look at this guy.
[115:24.65]He streamer rages so much.
[115:29.20]No, he doesn't really.
[115:30.38]He only does a moderate amount of anger.
[115:32.00]It's not that much.
[115:36.32]But I have to pick this up now, right?
[115:40.74]You might as well as we'll have more than one item now as annoying as that is Oh Count Chocula Oh Dracula Make sure you give me count Dracula count Chocula.
[116:03.17]Oh

[116:25.58]I don't want to rock.
[116:26.44]They're going to be up the stairs.
[116:27.40]I'm going to run into them, aren't they?
[116:28.96]Yup.
[116:29.44]Nope.
[116:34.38]So used to not reloading.
[116:35.42]That's so terrible.
[116:36.80]Oh, fuck is right.
[116:37.72]This thing takes a million years to reload to him.
[116:49.65]At least the money thing is still here.
[116:51.49]That's a big deal.
[116:52.31]I don't want to blow this run.
[116:54.33]This run has to stay intact because the money issue.
[117:03.68]You want to keep getting money.
[117:10.24]Nothing in there.
[117:12.64]You recover health every time you kill an enemy, but meat no longer gives you health.
[117:19.26]Well, that sucks.
[117:19.86]But whatever.
[117:32.81]Ah!
[117:44.44]Meat no longer give... That's actually not that terrible.
[117:46.89]And there's a new gun.

[117:50.25]Thank the Lord.
[117:54.03]What is it?

[118:02.23]We need to make as much money as possible, guys.
[118:13.19]Whatever jackpot means, please tell me that's just gonna, like, dump money in my bank account.
[118:16.05]That'd be so amazing.
[118:22.59]Only shot one shot for those guys, right?
[118:24.41]Yeah.
[118:29.20]Reload.
[118:30.14]Whoa, whoa.

[118:37.80]It's a pretty good gun.
[118:40.74]Pretty good.
[118:46.07]I was not expecting him to be right there.
[118:54.41]Did you guys give me like a curse of the lost or something?
[118:56.36]Here we go.
[119:03.10]A lot of money.

[119:34.43]And away we go.
[119:36.76]Carnivore, Lord of War, and a new beginning.
[119:39.32]They keep giving a new beginning.
[119:41.74]They want to ruin everything.
[119:47.80]Don't ruin it for me.
[119:49.60]I know I've said that a bunch of times already, but don't ruin it for me.
[119:57.47]This way.
[120:02.49]Watch out for the... Come on.
[120:07.23]This stupid opened up room.
[120:13.50]Don't do that.
[120:16.31]Although I do gotta say, I like this kill enemies and get health thing.
[120:19.81]It's keeping me nearly at full health.
[120:28.01]Very much nearly full health.

[120:36.87]And you say, it's a money stream, baby.
[120:39.19]Jackpot.
[120:40.99]Well, it's a fake money stream.
[120:43.71]This isn't real money.
[120:45.31]But yes, it is a jackpot stream.
[120:53.62]That was a useless room.
[120:57.16]But whatever.

[126:29.62]Like, thanks a lot, community.
[126:35.65]Why does it feel like every one of these rooms is like a dead end?
[126:37.41]It's because it is.
[126:38.81]Every room is a dead end.
[126:42.69]Hurts others too.
[126:43.31]Yeah, that's true.

[126:56.60]Yeah, the kunai.
[126:58.22]These things are good.
[126:59.36]I don't want the dynamite.
[127:00.56]If I want to blow something up, I'll use this.
[127:02.10]Because at least I can aim this better.
[127:03.97]Okay.
[127:12.86]Where's this?
[127:13.98]Oh, there it is.
[127:15.36]So once I open this door, I'm gonna... Sarah!

[127:30.97]Keep it going.
[127:32.05]Hope you make some cash.
[127:33.71]Hope you make some fucking money.
[127:37.19]Have a good one.
[127:40.24]Look at all that money.
[127:52.69]Give it to me.
[127:53.13]Give me that.
[127:53.47]Give me that.
[127:53.81]Give me that.
[127:54.19]Roll the connivers kunai.
[127:56.56]Team Fortress 2 reference.
[127:58.56]That's right.
[127:59.46]He said a TF2 thing.
[128:02.14]Everybody freak the fuck out in chat.
[128:05.42]Ow.
[128:07.22]Ah.
[128:07.58]Come on.
[128:09.72]What the fuck am I doing?
[128:18.70]Seal the deal.
[128:19.25]Thanks for the five dollars.
[128:21.61]Did somebody say money stream?
[128:24.27]Yes, you just did.
[128:25.63]Actually, somebody did before you, too.
[128:26.75]I think Froglock did as well.
[128:29.25]No, Jaffa Sneeze did.
[128:38.52]Oh!
[128:41.84]Too much damage.
[128:44.80]You can see the enemies through walls with wall ray vision.
[128:47.13]Thank you, Twitch chat community.
[128:48.63]Thank you.
[128:51.07]Oh fuck.
[128:58.89]Lots of money.
[129:06.27]Thankfully these guys have one hit.
[129:07.88]That would have been so annoying if they weren't.
[129:09.26]This is gonna explode.
[129:12.58]Each individual one of these dumb frogs is gonna come out.
[129:15.08]See if I can bounce that over there.
[129:16.80]Didn't work.
[129:19.20]That did.
[129:22.10]Okay.
[129:23.40]This meat does nothing, but it's okay.
[129:25.10]Whatever.
[129:25.42]Let's get some reloading in.
[129:31.23]Caution, wet floor.
[129:33.53]Am I going to get my first negative one?
[129:36.09]You guys actually going to give me a negative right now?
[129:39.20]I thought you guys were going to be cool about that, because it's like... Come on.
[129:44.36]You guys are supposed to be my friends.
[129:51.60]How are you guys supposed to be my friends if you're going to give me caution wet floor?
[129:54.70]Didn't drop anything.
[130:03.60]Whatever.
[130:06.40]You turned into a chicken.
[130:08.05]One thing I don't like about the chicken thing, I don't think they drop items.
[130:11.75]You're definitely not my friends.
[130:12.95]Is that what you do?
[130:14.53]We were never friends?
[130:15.21]Are you serious?
[130:19.47]Why are you going to be like that?
[130:23.11]That scared the fuck out of me.
[130:24.17]I need, like, 6,000 gold.
[130:30.57]And I'll be happy with this run.
[130:35.06]How dare you call me a friend.
[130:38.78]Okay, well.
[130:40.36]I guess I thought differently.
[130:42.00]To the right.
[130:44.88]What time is it?
[130:45.34]It is...
[130:53.33]5, just have to get to 5 o'clock.
[130:54.65]I gotta get going here in about 30 minutes or so, guys.
[130:57.67]Just about.
[130:58.01]If you came in later, it's my nephew's birthday.
[131:03.17]Today.
[131:04.49]So.
[131:05.71]Nephew's birthday party.
[131:07.16]I gotta go to that.
[131:07.74]That's why I'm streaming early.
[131:09.78]And I can't remain still now.
[131:11.44]So, now this is gonna end a little... This is gonna end quicker.
[131:16.50]Oh, this hurts.
[131:22.32]Oh, I don't like this.
[131:24.19]I really don't like this.
[131:29.93]I feel like I'm lagging with this one.
[131:35.69]Well, here's the boss.
[131:43.58]The Pharaoh.
[131:49.46]That's fine.
[131:52.96]Six shots, right?
[131:59.50]That's just one hit with the kunai.
[132:04.32]That's a little amazing.
[132:06.10]How much damage does he take then?
[132:11.75]This whole not being able to stop moving thing sucks.
[132:17.77]Holy shit, that does a lot of damage.
[132:19.27]Okay, just hit him like a few more times.
[132:29.41]Wow.
[132:30.15]This thing, that's incredible.
[132:33.43]That does so much damage.
[132:45.08]Save the stream, press 2.
[132:46.20]What do you mean, save the stream?
[132:48.04]No, I can do this.
[132:58.62]I feel like they should drop more money.
[133:02.88]Is the flare gun better than the grenade launcher?
[133:05.34]I wonder.
[133:05.68]Looks like procrastinator.
[133:09.80]Whatever that is.
[133:10.30]I don't know.
[133:11.94]I'm going to leave that.
[133:12.52]I think I'm good with these weapons.
[133:17.13]Let's keep it up.
[133:20.35]Telekinesis?
[133:20.93]What is that?
[133:21.29]Can I see through chests or something?
[133:23.43]Why would that be that?
[133:24.47]Ugh.
[133:26.33]More money, more gold, and they have more attack.
[133:28.79]Yeah, you got it.
[133:29.71]Let's go.
[133:32.41]Let's make it happen.
[133:37.08]This is the range for picking up items.
[133:39.70]It's kind of like a magnet.
[133:42.44]Oh.
[133:46.95]Okay, cool.
[133:47.89]Where the hell did you come from?
[133:54.26]I'm gonna throw up from this.
[133:59.08]I'm actually gonna puke from that.
[134:00.44]That sucks.
[134:06.77]That sucks so bad.
[134:11.27]Oh, I don't like it.
[134:12.41]I don't like it.
[134:13.39]I don't like this.
[134:20.16]Oh my god.
[134:30.74]I'm up past my money threshold though, so that's a good thing.
[134:33.26]This is actually making me sick.
[134:39.54]Elevator.
[134:40.46]Infinite ammo!
[134:42.78]I see infinite ammo on there.
[134:46.48]You guys see infinite ammo, right?
[134:48.58]What's going on here?
[134:49.49]Why are we not voting for infinite ammo?
[134:53.81]Why are we voting for Elevator?
[135:05.94]Elevator's gonna win.
[135:06.76]Does that just, like, take me up another floor?
[135:10.70]Don't need it?
[135:13.42]I guess that's true.
[135:20.54]I hate this no stop moving thing.
[135:27.20]Just skating around, it's the worst.
[135:33.08]And I'm stuck.
[135:40.23]One more frog room, whatever.
[135:52.16]These guys make a really weird noise, by the way.
[135:53.80]They do like a chicken cluck.
[135:56.68]The stairs on this floor take you up two floors.
[135:59.56]Oh, boy.
[136:00.34]That's going to bring me to the boss, isn't it?
[136:06.61]I don't want that.
[136:10.13]Well, okay.
[136:12.09]Two floors.
[136:14.61]Does that mean... I don't even know what that really means.
[136:18.93]But I guess get excited for it anyways.
[136:22.75]I don't want the crowbar.
[136:23.70]Keep moving, yeah.
[136:41.07]I can skate.
[136:47.76]It is so annoying.
[136:52.61]I will complain about that until the end of the stream.
[136:54.82]You better believe it.
[137:11.02]Holy shit, that hurt.
[137:19.67]Oh!
[137:19.77]What am I doing?
[137:21.56]What are you doing?
[137:22.40]What are you doing?
[137:23.36]Slow down.
[137:23.85]Stop it, please.
[137:46.30]I hate this stop moving thing.
[137:48.58]Can you guys give me a stop?
[137:49.90]Why are you giving me turret mode?
[137:51.26]I can't use turret mode.
[137:54.85]Is that the joke guys?
[137:56.05]I can't use that.
[137:57.01]What a fucking nightmare this has turned into.
[138:17.39]Your attack increases when you stand still.
[138:19.21]Well, that's fantastic.
[138:24.23]That sounds like a great thing to have right now.
[138:36.22]Cash.
[138:39.44]The air is lava.
[138:43.15]No.
[138:44.67]Oh, well.
[138:50.50]This started out really good.
[138:54.51]And then everybody wanted to make the funny jokes.
[139:01.81]Get me out of here.
[139:20.77]It's just having rubber banding my internet doesn't work.
[139:24.06]Oh Come on.
[139:25.18]Come on It's not fair time trial fucking what do you mean time trial?
[139:31.92]Time trial for what?
[139:34.79]I'm gonna fucking die in this room because you can't stop moving.
[139:37.37]I'm dead in this room.
[139:38.47]Hope you guys are fucking happy.
[139:39.47]Oh
[139:41.48]Yeah, because I couldn't fucking stop moving.
[139:44.45]I was guaranteed to die in that room.
[139:46.85]Great.
[139:48.03]What a fucking fantastic thing to have.
[139:55.52]There goes elevator.
[139:56.36]Because, like, I couldn't... Like, moving is permanent.
[140:10.53]Yeah, it wasn't possible for me to lose that one.
[140:13.07]Press the S key on your keyboard.
[140:14.53]I go backwards and I move back.
[140:16.70]Did you see the scroll I had?
[140:17.94]It forces me to move permanently.
[140:22.48]No matter what direction I'm going.
[140:30.85]Let's try her.
[140:31.39]Alright, this is going to be the last one.
[140:38.19]I got a birthday to go to.
[140:40.01]I got $5,000.
[140:41.59]Let's spend it wisely.
[140:48.92]We gave you one bad scroll.
[140:50.44]No, you didn't.
[140:51.22]You took away all my fun stuff.
[140:55.66]I saw what you did.
[140:58.77]Let's see.
[140:59.67]More gold.
[141:00.17]Should I do more gold?
[141:01.01]That's a lot of money, though.
[141:04.73]Hmm.
[141:20.54]We'll do that one.
[141:21.28]We'll do... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[141:22.20]What is this?
[141:22.76]Goal is chest drop a topaz in addition to rewards.
[141:24.90]Let's do defense one more time.
[141:34.39]And do health again.
[141:38.92]More gold?
[141:39.42]Yeah.
[141:40.18]I just did that one.
[141:41.00]But this is $6,000.
[141:41.46]Damn.
[141:41.96]Damn.
[141:53.54]I can't afford these.
[141:57.36]I mean, the pyramid would be the same last time.
[141:59.16]No, that's stupid.
[142:04.34]So what are these?
[142:05.26]These are like grenades.
[142:06.92]I guess these are immediate impact grenades.
[142:11.73]What is her thing?
[142:12.39]She leaves a... She leaves a stump and she goes invisible.
[142:19.96]She has like a little machine gun.
[142:21.10]Okay.
[142:22.18]Well, let's give it a try.
[142:24.52]What's the recharge?
[142:25.02]It's a pretty long recharge, actually.
[142:33.82]He wants to complain about one bad scroll.
[142:35.72]Why don't we give him 20 bad scrolls?
[142:38.26]Oh, look at me.
[142:42.22]I'm Twitch chat.
[142:43.30]Well, I'm going to be so bad and mean to Dermot.
[142:45.62]Yeah, like, fuck you all.
[142:50.16]Oh, look at me.
[142:51.20]I'm Turbo.
[142:52.28]No, I'm Twitch chat.
[142:54.12]And I give Turbo bad scrolls.
[142:56.40]Look at me.
[142:58.58]Right?
[143:08.72]Just like try to give you guys a reason to be like, oh, yeah, well, fuck you.
[143:12.08]That didn't give me every bad scroll.
[143:16.54]Like, oh, you're gonna tell us, like, fuck you?
[143:18.68]Alright, well, fine.
[143:19.40]Here's, like, every bad... Oh, look at me!
[143:21.06]I have Twitch chat!
[143:24.52]Let's make the streamer do something funny!
[143:28.66]Unite against him.
[143:32.51]I'm gonna fucking win despite you guys.
[143:34.43]Give me every bad scroll.
[143:35.53]Do it!
[143:36.93]Do it!
[143:37.77]Give me every bad scroll.
[143:38.77]I'm gonna win the whole game.
[143:40.93]Just to fucking say I did.
[143:42.81]Just to spite you all.
[143:46.62]Give me your, do your worst.
[143:48.52]Do your worst.
[143:50.56]Do your, look at me!
[143:51.98]You know what I mean?
[143:52.48]Why did I do that?
[144:00.14]That was not a smart idea.
[144:01.28]Let's see what this does.
[144:06.74]So everybody attacks.
[144:07.76]This is actually really good.
[144:13.52]Worst run possible.
[144:17.10]What you're saying is, look at me, right?
[144:19.26]Is that what you're trying to say?
[144:20.53]You can't switch weapons while you have ammo.
[144:22.35]Oh, yeah.
[144:23.37]Look at me.
[144:23.93]Yeah, right?
[144:24.69]Good.
[144:26.41]Yeah, me and this guy are the only two fucking friends we have.
[144:33.63]Don't worry.
[144:33.97]I'm going to win this fight, you all.
[144:38.65]They spawned on top of me.
[144:47.03]Don't worry, I'm gonna be fine.
[144:50.89]I'm fine.
[144:52.33]No issues at all.
[144:54.51]Jumped over that.
[144:58.27]And what's this?
[144:58.67]Oh, shit.
[145:00.61]I shouldn't have done that.
[145:11.13]Level 5 vegan?
[145:12.38]Oh, no.
[145:13.48]Oh, okay.
[145:16.07]Why is everybody giving me the good things?
[145:19.09]I was just so mean to everybody.
[145:20.53]I'm gonna keep this on.
[145:25.24]Aren't you guys supposed to be giving me the bad things?
[145:26.98]I was being the on-purpose mean guy so you guys would be mean to me.
[145:39.19]Now I'm gonna have a vegan phoenix.
[145:43.87]Reverse psychology.
[145:48.15]Oh, we better be nice to him then.
[145:49.71]Let's see what it does.
[146:02.69]Hey, Mitchell256, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[146:06.59]And they say... I don't want to die here.
[146:10.47]They say... Hold on.
[146:13.36]Yeah.
[146:14.26]Infinite ammo.
[146:16.40]I'm gonna be a fucking phoenix spammer.
[146:22.09]I spent most of my stream trying to defend you and give you good scrolls just for you to dare anyone to royally screw you over.
[146:28.71]RIP.
[146:29.07]I tried my best.
[146:31.35]Well, I'm sorry.
[146:32.59]I'm sorry.
[146:33.11]It was a joke.
[146:34.73]It was just a little funny joke.
[146:38.26]I don't actually hate you guys.
[146:39.72]I think you guys are fantastic.
[146:41.12]But, you know, like, look at me.
[146:42.98]That's all I was saying.
[146:48.80]Sorry, not sorry.
[146:49.96]Oh, no, see, look, a Twitch chat up to the road.
[146:51.64]Me, you know what I'm saying?
[146:52.88]Look at... This kind of sucks.
[147:05.03]I would much rather have anything else.
[147:09.00]Lies?
[147:09.30]What are you talking about?
[147:10.08]Look, why don't you guys just look at me?
[147:12.98]You know what I mean?
[147:13.42]Alright, I'm done with that.
[147:16.28]I'm done with that, like, fucking dumb reference.
[147:23.21]Will I still have infinite ammo?
[147:29.05]Look at me.
[147:29.59]I'm Jerma.
[147:33.09]Anytime you get in an argument with somebody, here's like a trick.
[147:35.41]Ready?
[147:35.57]You guys want to hear like a fun trick?
[147:38.21]Anytime you're in an argument with somebody, you want to instantly make them even more angry with you?
[147:44.15]Do that.
[147:45.87]Do that.
[147:47.83]And then, so say, look at me, say their name, say, look at me, I'm name, and then just repeat the sentence that they just said to you.
[147:58.78]So for instance, we'll give you an example.
[148:00.92]Uh...
[148:02.41]Okay, I have new random weapons.
[148:04.99]So we're in an argument.
[148:06.25]I'm in a heated argument with somebody.
[148:07.91]What is this?
[148:09.55]This has ammo now.
[148:11.92]No, it doesn't.
[148:12.34]What is this?
[148:15.30]No, it does have ammo.
[148:16.66]So anyways, heated argument.
[148:19.22]Somebody wants to convince me about... Whatever, let's just say that fucking pretzels are the best snack.
[148:28.70]What you say is, okay, let's say his name is, let's say his name is Randall.
[148:32.03]Like, Randy.
[148:33.83]Okay, so, like, oh, look at me.
[148:36.75]I'm Randy.
[148:37.93]I think pretzels are the best snack.
[148:39.73]And then, like, laugh and fucking roll your eyes.
[148:43.79]He will, he will be, it will infuriate him.
[148:46.33]Randy will fucking be infuriated.
[148:47.84]He might even grab for your neck.
[148:49.10]You know what I mean?
[148:49.88]He might, like, grab for your neck.
[148:51.78]With both hands.
[148:55.96]He's gonna be careful.
[148:59.35]Uh, well, we kinda have to take this.
[149:03.96]Yes, we do.
[149:04.78]Oh, well, whatever.
[149:10.39]Uh, that's fine.
[149:17.59]This is a third grade.
[149:20.51]I know, I know.
[149:21.87]I'm giving you guys third grade advice right now.
[149:26.28]Don't actually take that as advice.
[149:29.56]Look at me.
[149:31.12]Look, that is such like a fourth grade response.
[149:39.71]What's this?
[149:41.61]Ooh, look at me, I got an assault pistol.
[149:48.99]There's even more chests in this room.
[149:54.15]Decreases weapon accuracy.
[149:55.99]Oh!
[149:56.81]Look at me.
[149:57.41]I'm Twitch chat.
[149:59.35]I give decreased weapon accuracy.
[150:01.69]I'm in the fourth fucking raid.
[150:10.28]I don't know.
[150:10.60]That's a laser pistol.
[150:12.28]Um...
[150:15.14]No, salt pistol seems like fun to use.
[150:19.16]Hold on to it.
[150:24.61]And the final chest.
[150:26.61]Meat.
[150:27.61]Cool.
[150:31.28]Love is blind.
[150:33.60]Sure is.
[150:35.22]Although I don't really know what that means.
[150:43.14]Nice, like, laser sight.
[150:44.96]Meaningless laser sight.
[150:51.01]What?
[150:58.69]Why is that guy red?
[151:02.86]Okay.
[151:04.44]This gun really, like, is not that great from far.
[151:07.64]I don't like this gun.
[151:11.49]I want my old target back.
[151:13.79]I could actually aim at enemies that way.
[151:27.43]Although I have that stupid... I'm going to just waste the bullets on this, I think.
[151:31.63]I'm going to use the other gun.
[151:33.69]Oh, it's the decreased accuracy.
[151:35.01]Oh, right.
[151:36.31]Right, that's right.
[151:39.29]That is correct.
[151:40.85]Well, I can go this way.
[151:45.39]You can't see your health bar.
[151:46.85]Oh.
[151:48.09]Shit.
[151:50.65]See?
[151:51.09]He even said shit.
[151:55.19]It's alright.
[151:55.55]That's fine.
[151:55.95]I'll just go by instinct.
[152:03.16]I'll just go by instinct.
[152:05.16]It don't matter.
[152:06.28]I'm getting hit so much.
[152:12.30]I don't want to use this anymore.
[152:13.26]Get rid of it.
[152:13.66]I mean, this thing's okay.
[152:23.96]At least it has... At least I can shoot.
[152:29.20]At least I can shoot this gun.
[152:35.13]Up a floor.
[152:36.25]Let's go.
[152:38.37]Yeah, this is the last run.
[152:41.02]I got to get going here and actually I might have to cut this early.
[152:46.55]Yeah, that means we have to speedrun.
[152:47.63]Because I got to be somewhere in like less than an hour.
[152:53.69]Might end like right now.
[152:54.57]Because I can only shoot one bullet at a time.
[153:05.08]This is the worst gun for this situation.
[153:12.93]Oh my lord.
[153:13.55]Nobody go over there.
[153:24.60]I'm probably dead.
[153:25.44]Twitch streamer hates Sarah Nephew?
[153:39.89]What are you talking about?
[153:42.63]What?
[153:42.91]What?
[153:44.35]Decreases weapon accuracy again.
[153:45.89]We should give him his health bar back.
[153:53.09]You can't!
[153:55.89]I have no accuracy now.
[153:57.27]Oh, look at me!
[154:00.03]I'm Dremel and I can't aim!
[154:01.47]Oh, that's so funny.
[154:07.82]Look at me.
[154:09.28]Look at me.
[154:09.72]I can't aim.
[154:15.96]No, come on, give me a... Give me plentiful, whatever that means.
[154:19.82]Give me plentiful.
[154:25.24]Speedrun.
[154:28.75]See?
[154:29.25]If I leave, that means you guys can't vote for this one.
[154:31.55]Alright, can I at least get this first boss?
[154:44.22]Oh my God, I really can't aim.
[154:50.22]I'm so dead in here.
[154:53.54]Oh, God darn it.
[154:57.35]Low accuracy, what the hell are you talking about, game?
[154:59.49]That was like perfect.
[155:05.65]Decreased accuracy, my ass.
[155:06.73]I'm doing well.
[155:11.48]I forgot I have to win despite you guys.
[155:16.92]Serves you right, streamer.
[155:20.30]Don't worry.
[155:20.88]I'll at least get to the first boss.
[155:32.30]I'll get to that first boss, everybody.
[155:42.64]Now I have fall damage.
[155:47.06]Streamer claims to have beaten Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[155:49.64]Can't aim.
[155:51.28]And that just hurt myself.
[155:52.52]I forgot instantly the thing I just got.
[155:54.80]I must have... Like, less than 10% health.
[155:59.45]I do.
[155:59.67]I can hear the heartbeat.
[156:10.82]No!
[156:11.06]No!
[156:17.54]Come on, give me the health.
[156:19.04]I have to win, I have to prove everybody that I'm good.
[156:27.76]Okay, all out of ammo.
[156:29.14]Just use this one.
[156:29.90]Oh, fuck you.
[156:30.62]No!
[156:45.67]It's almost like I have lower accuracy.
[156:48.20]New gun.
[156:55.40]Give this to me.
[156:56.70]Easy.
[156:58.88]Accuracies don't even matter with this thing.
[157:00.58]I'm okay with this.
[157:04.84]You'll donate 10 bucks if I beat the boss.
[157:08.57]Okay.
[157:09.67]I'm gonna hold you to that.
[157:14.19]You said it in Twitch chat.
[157:15.13]That means it's law.
[157:19.41]Twitch chat just is law.
[157:21.05]Twitch is like the Bible.
[157:23.09]If you read something in Twitch chat, it's like law and it's real.
[157:28.78]I just said that everything in the Bible is real.
[157:32.00]I mean, I'm not a very religious person.
[157:34.76]I can't reload now.
[157:36.94]I mean, I'm not a religious person, so I don't even know why I just said that.
[157:42.04]But you know, it's like that same theory.
[157:44.28]Where, like, the Bible is rules.
[157:45.96]This actually is very hard.
[157:50.89]You guys have made this very difficult for me.
[157:54.25]It's not even that hard.
[157:58.11]Come on, you guys can make it harder.
[158:01.47]I think you guys can make it harder on me.
[158:02.87]I don't know why I'm asking for that.
[158:14.32]Fireman.
[158:17.12]Shit.
[158:19.98]Don't worry, I might just die in the frog room.
[158:27.11]I can't reload on demand.
[158:28.61]Shit.
[158:29.83]Oh, this is so bad.
[158:37.27]Fuck.
[158:38.15]Fuck.
[158:38.95]Fuck.
[158:41.67]Why won't they die?
[158:43.82]Why won't they- I don't understand.
[158:46.76]They don't have this much health.
[158:49.77]That thing just broke and I thought it was a person.
[159:09.28]Even more of this nonsense.
[159:12.40]Look at me.
[159:17.43]No way.
[159:17.77]I'm so inaccurate.
[159:19.02]Hey, you know what?
[159:19.64]Funny thing about accuracy, guys.
[159:21.78]You don't even need it when you swing it.
[159:24.80]Explosions do damage.
[159:27.06]Even to... Alright, fuck it.
[159:32.82]I'm going back to the gun.
[159:34.14]I'm not doing that.
[159:35.12]Shit.
[159:44.27]Shit.
[159:52.37]Can't wait to get wall ray vision from you guys.
[160:04.00]Hey.
[160:07.70]What is that?
[160:09.12]Now I'm going to keep the... Yeah, keep the Uzi.
[160:14.89]Leave.
[160:15.19]To where do they come in?
[160:19.69]Over here.
[160:23.53]And we can go all the way to the right and down.
[160:29.17]What does Cursed Favor even do?
[160:32.21]That I'm not sure.
[160:32.93]I'm sure I'll find out very shortly.
[160:34.70]Over here and down.
[160:45.52]Crowbar is the best pistol.
[160:49.28]Fucking fall damage.
[160:50.26]I forgot it existed again.
[160:52.98]God damn it.
[160:54.98]This room is huge.
[161:01.92]This is none.
[161:02.76]Look at this chaos!
[161:09.34]God, I'm so dead in this room.
[161:12.32]This is horrible.
[161:18.00]Increases your attack, but you can only carry one weapon.
[161:21.05]I'm okay with that.
[161:22.27]Because I don't... Fine.
[161:25.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[161:30.31]I'm okay with this.
[161:30.83]I don't have to worry about ammo anymore.
[161:36.90]Oh, shit.
[161:38.16]I'm dead.
[161:39.44]There's a guy in the stairs.
[161:40.08]It's over.
[161:48.22]Well, thanks everybody!
[161:49.50]Is this the same way I died last time?
[161:56.28]Alright, let's spend some money and then I gotta get out of here.
[162:01.12]I gotta go to my nephew's birthday party.
[162:03.86]I didn't beat the boss?
[162:04.50]Well, that's because I was getting fucked with.
[162:06.26]Uh, I need... I wish I could... More gold?
[162:21.07]There's so many options.
[162:22.97]More health.
[162:25.03]Crit damage.
[162:26.93]That's what happens when you disrespect chat.
[162:28.93]I was just kidding.
[162:29.63]I love you guys.
[162:30.31]It was a joke.
[162:40.49]That's all I can do.
[162:45.20]And I can't afford any of this.
[162:48.85]Alright, so, uh, thanks everybody for watching.
[162:52.26]Really appreciate it.
[162:52.78]Thank you, uh, thank you, uh, Kite.
[162:55.96]Uh, go fly a kite for the two bucks.
[162:59.22]Finished my last day of college.
[163:00.52]Here's what's left of my bits.
[163:01.68]You and Ster both helped me not go absolutely nuts during it, so thanks, buddy.
[163:07.97]Well, thanks a lot.
[163:09.59]Appreciate that.
[163:10.93]Thank you for your final two dollars.
[163:13.99]Uh, yeah, of course I love the Germamite family.
[163:17.54]You guys are, like, the best.
[163:20.47]But I want to say a couple things here.
[163:22.33]Thank you so much to Sarah.
[163:26.58]Congratulations, Sarah, on your new job on Ulta.
[163:30.84]Very, very good job.
[163:32.99]Wish you the best.
[163:34.13]Sriracha, that's your nickname.
[163:35.41]I know that one.
[163:38.51]I'll see you guys later.
[163:42.39]Take care.
[163:44.05]Have fun with whatever you're doing.
[163:47.13]I will see you guys.
[163:49.29]I like this game.
[163:50.67]I might just keep playing this game.
[163:53.74]I really think I'm going to keep playing this game.
[163:57.38]We'll see.
[163:59.36]Every time I say we'll see and I take a break from a game, I never go back to it.
[164:02.56]So I might just stream this game until I'm sick of fucking playing it.
[164:06.61]So, yeah.
[164:08.31]Have a good one, everybody.
[164:09.01]Take care.
[164:11.14]I will see you soon.
[164:12.81]Much love.
[164:14.83]And we are out of here.
[164:16.69]Have a good night, guys.
[165:03.09]No, wait, is Etalyx streaming right now?
[165:05.81]Alright, so the stream is still, my stream is still on, but Etalyx, I think, is streaming right now.
[165:12.80]Go watch Etalyx.
[165:19.42]Here's a convenient link if you guys want to go watch Etalyx.
[165:23.80]Not on his YouTube, on his Twitch channel.
[165:27.18]Go check out Etalyx.
[165:28.10]He's a fucking cool dude.
[165:29.18]And yeah, I'll see you guys later.
[165:31.80]Bye.
[165:34.33]Bye-bye.
