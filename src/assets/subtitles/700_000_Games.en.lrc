[00:11.61]Picked that up today.
[00:13.94]What does it say on it?
[00:17.40]700,000 games?
[00:19.28]I'll never have to play another game in my entire life.
[00:22.34]It's an award winner.
[00:23.14]See, look, it's got a red ribbon.
[00:24.94]It's an award winner.
[00:27.00]I'm not even sure there have been 700,000 games ever made.
[00:30.56]But, yeah, that's a steal, in my opinion.
[00:35.12]Some dude is selling this game for one cent.
[00:38.25]I mean, let's be real here.
[00:39.67]At what point do you just burn it?
[00:43.38]I bought this game for 10 bucks.
[00:45.60]So if you use the lowest valuation of this game, I paid for nearly a thousand copies.
[00:51.00]And I'm gonna play every single game in the box.
[00:53.74]So I better get started.
[00:55.10]Because if I have one minute of time in each game, it would still take me about two years to play every game.
[01:01.00]So, go pop some popcorn, go get yourself comfortable, because we might be here for a while.
[01:07.37]Jewel Mines!
[01:09.17]How do I play Jewel Mines?
[01:12.21]Who cares?
[01:13.81]I'll show you how you play Jewel Mines.
[01:15.21]You click the three globs.
[01:18.06]Like this.
[01:21.66]I don't even know how to play Texas Hold'em.
[01:24.98]Especially considering there's a Dungeons & Dragons 12-sided die here, too.
[01:28.90]I don't understand.
[01:29.48]What is this for?
[01:32.01]Fold.
[01:33.04]Fold.
[01:34.02]Fold.
[01:35.04]Fold.
[01:36.06]Fold.
[01:37.02]Fold.
[01:40.00]Well, might as well fold.
[01:41.90]Fold.
[01:44.66]Raise.
[01:45.66]Raise.
[01:47.14]Raise.
[01:48.08]Raise.
[01:49.47]Raise.
[01:50.47]Raise.
[01:51.69]Raise.
[01:52.75]Raise.
[01:53.23]I'm putting a lot of money into this.
[01:54.63]Raise.
[01:55.63]Raise.
[01:56.59]Raise.
[01:57.69]Raise.
[01:58.65]Raise.
[01:59.65]Call.
[02:00.77]Uh-oh.
[02:01.97]What does that guy have?
[02:02.71]I got a Jack 10.
[02:04.15]Here comes a river!
[02:05.97]Here comes a river!
[02:08.77]Oh, he won.
[02:10.09]He just won like $50,000.
[02:11.59]Good for you.
[02:15.07]So this is Pac-Man.
[02:17.24]Here's the difference.
[02:18.00]There's this Pac-Man right here.
[02:20.02]And then you've got, instead of the ghosts, you have cars.
[02:23.34]Three cars.
[02:24.58]There were four ghosts in Pac-Man.
[02:25.96]Who the fuck is this?
[02:28.60]They aren't even attempting to hide the fact that this is Pac-Man.
[02:32.58]Even look at the top right.
[02:34.36]Pac-Mania Classic?
[02:36.06]I thought this was called Munchie-Mania.
[02:39.64]They aren't even attempting to make it.
[02:41.76]Look, this is Pac-Man on the screen.
[02:46.09]Oh, wow, Super Frog!
[02:49.65]I really like this one.
[02:52.05]I don't know, something about the main character.
[02:55.45]Candies!
[02:56.47]And there's candies!
[02:58.06]How could you not like it?
[02:59.00]It's got candy!
[03:00.88]Hidden Object Mania.
[03:04.36]Click anywhere under the image when you spot a difference.
[03:06.78]Find all seven before time runs out.
[03:10.68]His eyes are... I'm just clicking everywhere.
[03:14.50]It doesn't even matter.
[03:15.14]I will win because I'm just spamming.
[03:18.49]It doesn't even matter.
[03:19.03]I win.
[03:21.65]That's the strategy, guys.
[03:24.05]Let's do it again.
[03:26.59]Why are you booing me?
[03:27.81]Don't boo me!
[03:29.87]I just beat the level in like less than 10 seconds, you're gonna boo me?
[03:35.16]I can't stop it.
[03:37.90]It's fucking breaking my computer.
[03:43.50]Come on, I need to be able to get down to my taskbar.
[03:53.22]This is what I'm talking about.
[03:56.67]This is 3D graphics.
[03:59.83]Let's do it.
[04:00.63]Green light, mains go.
[04:07.03]Monster truck stunt rally!
[04:08.11]I'm going off this thing, whatever this is.
[04:15.32]I'm gonna go right through the middle.
[04:26.35]secret of the empires of the ancient world of maya
[04:54.03]Oh yeah, the secrets of ancient Maya.
[04:57.43]And the staple guns.
[05:00.76]Yeah, make sure you find those scissors too.
[05:02.92]And the crowbar.
[05:06.02]What are those?
[05:06.38]Are those handcuffs?
[05:08.42]Just for good measure.
[05:09.38]We'll throw in an Eiffel Tower too.
[05:10.67]You know, the thing that's in France that has nothing to do with ancient Maya.
[05:14.75]Go ahead and toss that in here.
[05:16.61]Why not?
[05:26.84]Alright, got it.
[05:27.55]I'm just going to straighten it out.
[05:28.61]I'm just going to straighten it out.
[05:29.51]I'm just going to go another 200 miles.
[05:30.77]I'll just straighten it.
[05:44.21]And there we go.
[05:45.62]Big head tennis.
[05:47.38]This is what you came for, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:50.14]Spike it.
[05:51.38]Man, yeah, that's nice.
[05:52.34]Nice job.
[05:52.72]Excellent work.
[05:54.02]Oh, yeah, just swing backwards.
[05:55.14]Just swing backwards.
[05:57.32]I gotta go get... I gotta pick up the cavemen and deliver them.
[06:01.56]Come here.
[06:01.90]Okay, I... Apparently, I... I apparently killed that guy.
[06:06.77]How do you get them to get in?
[06:09.77]How do you get them to get in?
[06:10.87]Did I just lose?
[06:17.56]This is a scary game.
[06:20.64]Push these boxes, Joe.
[06:24.11]You don't have a t-shirt on.
[06:26.55]You probably don't even have underwear on.
[06:28.03]You don't even have socks on.
[06:31.03]Farmer Joe just wakes up in the morning, puts on his overalls on his nude body, and loafers, and then he goes to work.
[06:36.85]I don't know, something about that ain't right.
[06:39.91]There's not much left to do here.
[06:45.78]World War II, every little dog fight.
[06:51.58]We're going, I don't know where we're going.
[06:54.97]What a beautiful working day.
[06:56.02]Your first mission is to destroy a nearby factory.
[06:58.98]Okay.
[07:05.40]Oh, classic.
[07:06.38]The classic game of dual wizardry.
[07:10.66]If you think you're powerful enough to take on my challenge, I'm wearing a fucking red dress and a bathrobe with a Diablo II paladin scepter.
[07:25.58]Oh, I get it.
[07:26.18]I actually get it.
[07:26.94]I get it.
[07:27.42]Ooh, I didn't... I did it.
[07:35.77]I played them all.
[07:37.51]You're probably wondering, how the hell did you do that so fast?
[07:39.49]Irma, that's remarkable.
[07:41.81]Well, I mean, there's only 145 games on the whole disc.
[07:45.53]You're looking at every single game.
[07:47.91]Unless, of course, you don't count the Match 3 clones, or the copious amounts of hidden object games that are essentially the same game.
[07:56.37]Oh, almost forgot.
[07:57.81]All the games that don't work.
[07:59.77]They physically do nothing when you click them.
[08:02.59]So, I mean, in 91, they're a little short of 700,000.
[08:07.77]Exactly 0.013% of 700,000.
[08:08.35]Close enough, right?
[08:09.03]I mean, come on.
